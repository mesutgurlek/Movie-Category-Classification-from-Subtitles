1
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:21,880
Wu.

2
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:25,519
You and your brothers
murdered three of our men.

3
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:27,959
He would have done the same.

4
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:30,359
Send three more and l'll kill them, too.

5
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:33,799
He already controls the opium trade
all across Asia.

6
00:02:33,918 --> 00:02:35,879
May no one prosper but Ying Ko?

7
00:02:35,998 --> 00:02:38,838
My poppy fields are tiny.
Nothing compared to his.

8
00:02:39,439 --> 00:02:42,918
l, Li Peng, at least l'm entitled
to my little piece.

9
00:02:43,678 --> 00:02:47,357
Ying Ko, if you kill me, l promise...

10
00:02:47,638 --> 00:02:49,757
...my brothers will come for you.

11
00:02:50,317 --> 00:02:52,516
And l promise you...

12
00:02:55,516 --> 00:02:57,557
...l'll bury them beside you.

13
00:02:58,116 --> 00:02:59,236
Kill him.

14
00:03:06,635 --> 00:03:09,276
Let me go. l only wish to leave.

15
00:03:09,555 --> 00:03:11,275
l'll cut his throat.

16
00:03:11,516 --> 00:03:14,595
Your men are not marksmen enough
to shoot around him.

17
00:03:14,955 --> 00:03:16,715
You're right.

18
00:03:16,795 --> 00:03:18,594
You're right.

19
00:03:19,034 --> 00:03:20,995
Wu, you are a wonderful friend.

20
00:03:21,433 --> 00:03:25,234
-Like a father to me.
-Thank you, Ying Ko.

21
00:03:27,314 --> 00:03:28,433
Shoot through him.

22
00:04:21,468 --> 00:04:22,948
Where are you taking me?

23
00:04:23,028 --> 00:04:26,468
A Tulku wishes to see you at his temple.

24
00:04:26,628 --> 00:04:28,748
A holy man wants to see me?

25
00:04:30,707 --> 00:04:33,627
-You call that a temple?
-No.

26
00:04:34,146 --> 00:04:35,667
There.

27
00:04:46,706 --> 00:04:48,865
Where did that come from?

28
00:04:49,306 --> 00:04:51,745
The clouded mind sees nothing.

29
00:05:31,460 --> 00:05:34,781
-Who are you?
-l am your teacher.

30
00:05:35,261 --> 00:05:39,340
Do you have any idea
who you just kidnapped?

31
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:41,540
Cranston.

32
00:05:42,261 --> 00:05:43,740
Lamont Cranston.

33
00:05:43,819 --> 00:05:45,579
You know my real name?

34
00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:47,580
Yes.

35
00:05:48,779 --> 00:05:52,459
l also know that for as long
as you can remember...

36
00:05:52,978 --> 00:05:56,379
...you struggled against your own
black heart and always lost.

37
00:05:56,699 --> 00:06:00,058
You watched your spirit,
your very face, change...

38
00:06:00,218 --> 00:06:02,979
...as the beast claws its way out
from within you.

39
00:06:03,058 --> 00:06:06,258
You are in great pain, aren't you?

40
00:06:09,497 --> 00:06:11,937
You know what evil lurks
in the hearts of men...

41
00:06:12,018 --> 00:06:14,337
...for you have seen that evil in your heart.

42
00:06:14,417 --> 00:06:17,856
Every man pays the price for redemption.
This is yours.

43
00:06:18,096 --> 00:06:21,296
-l'm not looking for redemption.
-You have no choice.

44
00:06:21,736 --> 00:06:23,096
You will be redeemed...

45
00:06:23,176 --> 00:06:26,896
...because l will teach you to use
your black shadow to fight evil.

46
00:06:27,455 --> 00:06:28,896
l wouldn't do that.

47
00:07:16,930 --> 00:07:17,890
Phurba.

48
00:07:22,771 --> 00:07:24,010
Phurba!

49
00:07:27,130 --> 00:07:28,290
Am l in hell?

50
00:07:31,609 --> 00:07:33,489
Not yet.

51
00:08:30,723 --> 00:08:32,043
Get him, Johnny.

52
00:08:32,124 --> 00:08:33,483
Maxie.

53
00:08:34,043 --> 00:08:36,323
-Let's get this over with.
-Get out.

54
00:08:36,523 --> 00:08:38,122
-No!
-Come on!

55
00:08:38,443 --> 00:08:41,483
-Please, l didn't see anything.
-Quit your whining.

56
00:08:41,763 --> 00:08:44,922
-ls it dry?
-Please.

57
00:08:45,282 --> 00:08:48,281
-Perfect, Duke.
-Bring him to the rail.

58
00:08:48,441 --> 00:08:50,321
l won't tell anyone. l swear.

59
00:08:50,562 --> 00:08:51,882
Geez.

60
00:08:53,441 --> 00:08:55,761
l wish l could trust you, sport. l really do.

61
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:58,521
l guess you just picked the wrong alley
to look down.

62
00:08:58,601 --> 00:09:01,481
-l have a family.
-They'll get over it.

63
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:05,800
l won't talk. l'm telling you.

64
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:08,520
l know you won't.

65
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:10,439
Dump him.

66
00:09:10,519 --> 00:09:13,720
-No. No!
-l hate heavy lifting.

67
00:09:14,598 --> 00:09:17,478
No!

68
00:09:19,758 --> 00:09:22,079
-What in Christ was that?
-Who's there?

69
00:09:33,638 --> 00:09:34,718
Show yourself.

70
00:09:34,797 --> 00:09:38,516
-You murdered a policeman, Duke.
-Who said that?

71
00:09:38,797 --> 00:09:40,677
Duke, who said that?

72
00:09:40,757 --> 00:09:44,476
-Shut up!
-The weed of crime bears bitter fruit.

73
00:09:44,837 --> 00:09:49,076
l don't like this. This stinks.
Let's get the hell outta here!

74
00:09:49,396 --> 00:09:53,275
-Shut your hole, Maxie!
-Did you think you'd get away with it?

75
00:09:53,516 --> 00:09:55,115
Come on, Duke!

76
00:09:57,755 --> 00:10:01,674
Did you think l wouldn't know?

77
00:10:35,510 --> 00:10:37,791
Duke, l think you got him.

78
00:10:39,630 --> 00:10:41,710
You're damn right l....

79
00:10:47,350 --> 00:10:49,550
You committed murder, Duke.

80
00:10:49,789 --> 00:10:53,109
-Now you're going to confess to it.
-Like hell l will.

81
00:10:53,390 --> 00:10:57,149
You will, because ifyou don't, l'll be there.

82
00:10:59,669 --> 00:11:02,948
l'll be there, around every corner...

83
00:11:03,069 --> 00:11:08,747
...in every empty room, as inevitable as
your guilty conscience.

84
00:11:08,828 --> 00:11:12,108
You don't scare me, you son of a--

85
00:11:15,707 --> 00:11:18,907
You will go to the eighth precinct house
on Second Avenue...

86
00:11:18,986 --> 00:11:22,586
...and surrender yourself,
and you will do it now.

87
00:11:22,746 --> 00:11:24,906
l confess! l'll do it!

88
00:11:25,706 --> 00:11:26,906
Oh, my God!

89
00:11:27,026 --> 00:11:28,666
Oh, my God!

90
00:11:28,866 --> 00:11:31,986
l'll confess! For God's sake,
l don't wanna die.

91
00:12:18,581 --> 00:12:19,861
No!

92
00:12:20,261 --> 00:12:21,861
No! No!

93
00:12:48,058 --> 00:12:50,178
Drive!

94
00:12:53,537 --> 00:12:54,938
Thank you.

95
00:12:55,258 --> 00:12:58,257
You are probably busy.
You can just drop me off anywhere--

96
00:12:58,337 --> 00:13:03,097
You're Dr. Roy Tam, a professor
in the Science Department at N.Y.U.

97
00:13:03,417 --> 00:13:06,776
-Yes.
-l've saved your life, Roy Tam.

98
00:13:07,336 --> 00:13:10,456
-lt now belongs to me.
-lt does?

99
00:13:14,696 --> 00:13:17,055
You'll become one of my agents...

100
00:13:17,135 --> 00:13:19,735
...like dozens of others all over the world.

101
00:13:20,254 --> 00:13:23,215
Could l ask my wife about this?

102
00:13:23,614 --> 00:13:25,334
No!

103
00:13:27,454 --> 00:13:29,374
Mr. Shrevnitz here will instruct you...

104
00:13:29,454 --> 00:13:33,214
...in the way in which l will contact you
should l require your help.

105
00:13:33,693 --> 00:13:38,052
When you hear one of my agents say,
''The sun is shining''...

106
00:13:39,093 --> 00:13:43,653
...you will respond,
''But the ice is slippery.''

107
00:13:43,812 --> 00:13:47,492
This will identify you to each other.
Do you understand?

108
00:13:47,932 --> 00:13:50,132
''The sun is shining.''

109
00:13:50,332 --> 00:13:53,132
''But the ice is slippery.''

110
00:13:53,891 --> 00:13:56,132
Tell me one thing.

111
00:13:56,371 --> 00:13:58,811
How did you know
what was happening to me?

112
00:13:59,090 --> 00:14:01,130
How did you know who l am?

113
00:14:07,409 --> 00:14:10,250
The Shadow knows.

114
00:14:29,888 --> 00:14:32,127
Thank you. That's the Shadow!

115
00:14:32,448 --> 00:14:35,447
-l mean, that's the Shadow!
-You're a pretty smart guy.

116
00:14:35,527 --> 00:14:37,647
l heard rumors in the paper, on the radio.

117
00:14:37,727 --> 00:14:40,526
But l thought it was just talk.
l didn't think he existed.

118
00:14:40,606 --> 00:14:42,807
He doesn't. Get it?

119
00:14:46,566 --> 00:14:48,566
Don't ever take it off.

120
00:14:49,406 --> 00:14:51,725
Wait a minute. Who are you?

121
00:14:52,446 --> 00:14:54,645
Somebody who owes him his life.

122
00:14:55,405 --> 00:14:57,845
Somebody just like you.

123
00:15:18,483 --> 00:15:20,163
Boss, you okay?

124
00:15:22,442 --> 00:15:23,722
The Cobalt Club.

125
00:16:46,755 --> 00:16:49,914
Sorry l'm late, Uncle Wainwright,
but there was a little...

126
00:16:49,994 --> 00:16:51,914
...accident on the bridge.

127
00:16:51,993 --> 00:16:53,913
l didn't think you wanted me to wait.

128
00:16:53,994 --> 00:16:56,714
lncidentally, try the prime rib.
lt's excellent.

129
00:16:56,953 --> 00:16:58,913
Your usual, Mr. Cranston.

130
00:16:58,993 --> 00:17:01,713
-Thank you very much.
-You're welcome.

131
00:17:02,673 --> 00:17:05,672
You know, Lamont,
l'm very upset with you.

132
00:17:06,792 --> 00:17:08,991
-What is it this time?
-What is it this time?

133
00:17:09,072 --> 00:17:10,392
What is it every time?

134
00:17:10,472 --> 00:17:12,912
You ask me to dinner
and show up an hour late.

135
00:17:12,991 --> 00:17:16,351
-There's no excuse--
-Uncle Wainwright, l'm sorry, l...

136
00:17:20,231 --> 00:17:21,431
...l got caught up.

137
00:17:21,510 --> 00:17:24,230
With what, for God's sake?
You don't do anything.

138
00:17:24,311 --> 00:17:27,351
A man your age is unseemly.
At least pick a hobby or something.

139
00:17:28,991 --> 00:17:31,150
Why am l talking to the back of your neck?

140
00:17:31,230 --> 00:17:33,470
Lamont? Lamont?

141
00:17:34,590 --> 00:17:36,309
Sorry. What were we talking about?

142
00:17:36,390 --> 00:17:39,749
l've never meddled in your affairs,
going back to the time...

143
00:17:39,909 --> 00:17:43,148
...after the war when you disappeared
for some seven years.

144
00:17:43,228 --> 00:17:45,348
l never asked questions then. l'm not now.

145
00:17:45,429 --> 00:17:49,029
Excuse me, Police Commissioner Barth.
Urgent message for you, sir.

146
00:17:49,709 --> 00:17:52,908
What's the matter?
Cops and robbers business slowing down?

147
00:17:54,267 --> 00:17:57,187
lt's a report of that damned
Shadow character again.

148
00:17:58,587 --> 00:18:00,427
You said he was only a rumor.

149
00:18:00,507 --> 00:18:03,986
l'm sick of this Shadow business,
his meddling in police affairs.

150
00:18:04,107 --> 00:18:07,946
This time tomorrow,
l'll put a task force on him.

151
00:18:13,986 --> 00:18:16,745
You're not going to appoint a task force.

152
00:18:17,666 --> 00:18:19,624
No. Hell with him.

153
00:18:20,145 --> 00:18:22,065
l'm not going to appoint a task force.

154
00:18:22,145 --> 00:18:25,944
You're not going to pay any attention
to these reports of the Shadow.

155
00:18:26,465 --> 00:18:30,145
-lgnore them entirely.
-There is no Shadow.

156
00:18:31,023 --> 00:18:34,344
There is no Shadow.
lf there were, l'd be Eleanor Roosevelt.

157
00:18:38,183 --> 00:18:39,943
Where was l?

158
00:18:40,303 --> 00:18:42,503
You were about to tell me who she is.

159
00:18:43,222 --> 00:18:44,303
That's Margo Lane.

160
00:18:44,382 --> 00:18:47,183
Her father is a scientist working
for the War Department.

161
00:18:47,262 --> 00:18:49,302
What the hell do you see in her?

162
00:18:49,742 --> 00:18:53,022
Uncle Wainwright,
are you sure you're not dead?

163
00:18:53,541 --> 00:18:54,781
Not by a long shot.

164
00:18:54,862 --> 00:18:58,181
Send a bottle of Mouton Rothschild, 1928,
to that table.

165
00:18:58,941 --> 00:19:01,821
Do yourself a favor. Stay away from her.

166
00:19:02,140 --> 00:19:03,621
She's strange.

167
00:19:04,181 --> 00:19:07,100
She hears voices. That's what they say.

168
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:08,620
Really?

169
00:19:11,460 --> 00:19:13,860
Yes, l would like a glass of the Mouton--

170
00:19:13,939 --> 00:19:15,859
Rothschild, 1928.

171
00:19:16,579 --> 00:19:18,499
-Yes.
-From the gentleman.

172
00:19:18,779 --> 00:19:20,539
Gentleman?

173
00:19:21,898 --> 00:19:24,018
Lamont Cranston.

174
00:19:24,299 --> 00:19:25,338
May l sit?

175
00:19:34,137 --> 00:19:35,777
You know...

176
00:19:36,217 --> 00:19:39,497
...it's the strangest thing, but l have this...

177
00:19:39,978 --> 00:19:42,937
...sudden craving for Peking duck.

178
00:19:43,696 --> 00:19:46,057
That's so odd.

179
00:19:46,897 --> 00:19:49,056
l was thinking the exact same thing.

180
00:19:49,456 --> 00:19:50,776
Care to join me?

181
00:19:58,616 --> 00:20:00,495
You speak Chinese.

182
00:20:00,775 --> 00:20:02,935
Only Mandarin.

183
00:20:03,214 --> 00:20:05,134
Aren't you full of surprises?

184
00:20:07,694 --> 00:20:10,454
Thank you. l'm glad you like it.

185
00:20:11,134 --> 00:20:14,934
-l had it made at Adrian's.
-Why did you just tell me that?

186
00:20:16,094 --> 00:20:19,454
You just complimented me
on my dress just now.

187
00:20:19,893 --> 00:20:21,093
Didn't you?

188
00:20:21,173 --> 00:20:22,733
No, l didn't.

189
00:20:24,052 --> 00:20:25,812
But l was thinking it.

190
00:20:26,012 --> 00:20:30,533
Now that hasn't happened to me
in a long time.

191
00:20:30,612 --> 00:20:34,211
Since l was a little girl with my cousin,
l could hear what he was thinking.

192
00:20:34,292 --> 00:20:37,491
Just pick the thoughts right out
of his head before he said a word.

193
00:20:37,571 --> 00:20:41,171
lt was the strangest thing.
And l never was able....

194
00:20:43,091 --> 00:20:44,851
ls something bothering you?

195
00:20:45,211 --> 00:20:48,290
Oh! No.

196
00:20:48,970 --> 00:20:50,410
Not at all.

197
00:21:10,248 --> 00:21:12,768
Thank you. l had a wonderful time.

198
00:21:12,847 --> 00:21:15,368
l'm not sure l can recall an evening as...

199
00:21:16,007 --> 00:21:18,048
...stimulating.

200
00:21:21,687 --> 00:21:23,326
Good night, Miss Lane.

201
00:21:24,286 --> 00:21:26,486
Good night, Mr. Cranston.

202
00:21:34,126 --> 00:21:37,605
l like her, boss.
She's different than your usual dames.

203
00:21:37,805 --> 00:21:40,206
-More than even she knows.
-How's that?

204
00:21:40,845 --> 00:21:43,445
She has abilities
she's completely unaware of.

205
00:21:43,525 --> 00:21:44,964
No kidding?

206
00:21:45,245 --> 00:21:47,124
You gonna see her again?

207
00:21:47,244 --> 00:21:50,645
-No, it's much too dangerous.
-Dangerous for who?

208
00:21:51,204 --> 00:21:52,804
For me, Moe.

209
00:21:54,123 --> 00:21:55,123
For me.

210
00:22:26,481 --> 00:22:27,880
Someone's coming.

211
00:22:50,958 --> 00:22:54,038
-What is it?
-That's just it, sir. l don't know.

212
00:22:54,118 --> 00:22:57,158
l'd have labeled it a mummy case
coming from Tibet like it did.

213
00:22:57,237 --> 00:23:00,797
-Mummy cases come from Egypt.
-That's right. Exactly.

214
00:23:00,877 --> 00:23:04,237
Besides, the thing is metal, which
made me think it was a sarcophagus.

215
00:23:04,317 --> 00:23:07,956
No. Tibetan sarcophagi were of stone.

216
00:23:08,437 --> 00:23:10,956
What happened to the truck men
who dropped it off?

217
00:23:11,036 --> 00:23:12,356
Gone.

218
00:23:12,916 --> 00:23:17,036
lt's obviously an incorrect shipment.
Call our customs broker and....

219
00:23:18,836 --> 00:23:20,195
My God!

220
00:23:20,756 --> 00:23:22,475
This is beautiful!

221
00:23:25,354 --> 00:23:27,075
This is solid silver.

222
00:23:27,355 --> 00:23:29,474
Nelson, help us take the sides off.

223
00:23:42,714 --> 00:23:45,593
-What does it say?
-lt's Latin.

224
00:23:45,793 --> 00:23:49,552
''Kha Khan dei potestas in terra....''

225
00:23:49,712 --> 00:23:52,272
''The power of God on Earth...''

226
00:23:52,432 --> 00:23:56,033
''...the seal of the emperor of mankind.''

227
00:23:57,911 --> 00:24:00,031
Oh, my God!

228
00:24:01,111 --> 00:24:02,551
Temujin.

229
00:24:05,790 --> 00:24:08,310
This is the silver coffin of Temujin.

230
00:24:08,711 --> 00:24:10,270
Who's Temujin?

231
00:24:10,750 --> 00:24:14,390
The man who very nearly conquered
the globe eight centuries ago.

232
00:24:14,831 --> 00:24:17,270
How come l never heard of him?

233
00:24:19,709 --> 00:24:22,669
Temujin was the birth name...

234
00:24:23,869 --> 00:24:25,828
...of Genghis Khan.

235
00:24:27,628 --> 00:24:29,548
What was the shipper's address?

236
00:24:29,749 --> 00:24:31,908
lt didn't say.

237
00:24:32,267 --> 00:24:35,187
Label just had the country of origin.

238
00:24:36,348 --> 00:24:38,628
Let me make a telephone call.

239
00:24:38,788 --> 00:24:41,067
Let me help you.

240
00:24:42,467 --> 00:24:44,707
Nelson, whatever you do...

241
00:24:44,947 --> 00:24:47,147
...don't open it.

242
00:24:47,987 --> 00:24:49,586
No, sir.

243
00:26:32,176 --> 00:26:34,696
-We're closed.
-Join me...

244
00:26:35,976 --> 00:26:37,296
...or die.

245
00:26:38,615 --> 00:26:39,936
Excuse me?

246
00:26:43,855 --> 00:26:46,895
Join me or die.

247
00:26:47,055 --> 00:26:49,134
This is private property.

248
00:26:51,695 --> 00:26:55,014
-Your mind is weak.
-Don't come any closer.

249
00:26:56,734 --> 00:26:58,453
Fall to your knees.

250
00:27:03,413 --> 00:27:06,533
Put your gun to your temple.

251
00:27:13,533 --> 00:27:16,051
Sacrifice yourself...

252
00:27:17,131 --> 00:27:18,492
...to me.

253
00:27:18,852 --> 00:27:20,532
Yes, my Khan.

254
00:27:31,011 --> 00:27:32,131
Oh, my God!

255
00:27:32,250 --> 00:27:35,769
l can't believe it.
We were only gone for a moment.

256
00:27:53,009 --> 00:27:54,848
You didn't hear me, did you?

257
00:27:55,128 --> 00:27:57,408
l'm through with the beryllium sphere.

258
00:27:57,528 --> 00:28:00,168
l'm just doing some underwater tests
to check pressure.

259
00:28:00,248 --> 00:28:04,567
Farley, l have told you a dozen times,
we are doing energy research.

260
00:28:04,647 --> 00:28:08,046
l'm not interested in any military
application of the project.

261
00:28:09,527 --> 00:28:12,046
Why'd you let the War Department
pay all the bills?

262
00:28:12,126 --> 00:28:14,006
'Cause you talked me into it.

263
00:28:14,325 --> 00:28:16,886
l just wanted enough money to finish.

264
00:28:17,446 --> 00:28:20,405
Dr. Lane, you don't think big.

265
00:28:20,525 --> 00:28:23,485
lf you'd only listen to me,
the world could be our oyster.

266
00:28:23,565 --> 00:28:26,485
Oysters? l get a rash from oysters.

267
00:28:38,203 --> 00:28:40,844
Oh! Margo.

268
00:28:41,564 --> 00:28:44,123
What a beautiful dress.

269
00:28:44,963 --> 00:28:48,243
And such a clever neckline.

270
00:28:48,763 --> 00:28:51,722
Excuse me, Mr. Claymore,
l'd like to see my father.

271
00:28:53,363 --> 00:28:55,082
So...

272
00:28:56,243 --> 00:28:59,281
...when are you gonna come down
and see my beryllium sphere?

273
00:28:59,362 --> 00:29:02,522
l'm not interested in your spheres.

274
00:29:06,081 --> 00:29:07,961
Margo.

275
00:29:08,561 --> 00:29:11,120
You don't return my calls anymore.

276
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:13,761
That's not true.

277
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:16,920
-l never did return your calls.
-l know.

278
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:19,599
l can't imagine why.

279
00:29:21,559 --> 00:29:24,279
lt's because l don't like you.

280
00:29:30,038 --> 00:29:31,439
What a fascinating woman!

281
00:29:34,038 --> 00:29:36,598
Dad, l don't know how you can
work with that man.

282
00:29:36,678 --> 00:29:38,237
Margo!

283
00:29:38,437 --> 00:29:39,958
What a nice surprise.

284
00:29:41,238 --> 00:29:44,277
-Hi.
-Have you had your dinner?

285
00:29:44,597 --> 00:29:47,077
Yes, Dad. lt's 2:00 a.m.

286
00:29:48,077 --> 00:29:49,676
Where did you get this shirt?

287
00:29:49,756 --> 00:29:51,956
You said l look good in green.

288
00:29:52,597 --> 00:29:56,596
No, this is green. That's red.

289
00:29:57,356 --> 00:29:58,756
Red, green.

290
00:29:59,476 --> 00:30:02,795
To me, it's just a clean shirt.

291
00:30:06,075 --> 00:30:07,115
Dad?

292
00:30:07,235 --> 00:30:09,594
Do you believe in telepathy?

293
00:30:10,234 --> 00:30:15,154
l mean, do you believe that
it can exist between certain people?

294
00:30:15,914 --> 00:30:19,754
You mean mind reading?
Of course l don't. l'm a scientist.

295
00:30:21,593 --> 00:30:23,513
So strange.

296
00:30:24,714 --> 00:30:27,594
l've always had this feeling
that there was this...

297
00:30:28,273 --> 00:30:30,673
...indescribable connection out there...

298
00:30:31,512 --> 00:30:33,511
...just waiting for me.

299
00:30:34,512 --> 00:30:37,552
And suddenly tonight, there it was.

300
00:30:38,512 --> 00:30:40,231
That's nice.

301
00:30:41,152 --> 00:30:42,791
What was it?

302
00:30:44,231 --> 00:30:46,030
lt was a man.

303
00:30:47,871 --> 00:30:50,591
And l'm probably
never gonna see him again.

304
00:30:50,911 --> 00:30:52,950
But why not?

305
00:30:53,830 --> 00:30:56,070
l just know.

306
00:30:57,510 --> 00:31:01,269
lt was as though l could sense
what he was feeling.

307
00:31:03,589 --> 00:31:07,548
And now l'm completely
and utterly depressed.

308
00:31:07,708 --> 00:31:10,189
That's nice.

309
00:31:14,828 --> 00:31:16,828
Okay, that'll be $4.45.

310
00:31:17,229 --> 00:31:20,388
-What are you doing?
-Writing down the drop-off point.

311
00:31:20,707 --> 00:31:23,107
You are making a record
of my destination?

312
00:31:23,267 --> 00:31:25,227
Taxi commission's rules.

313
00:31:33,306 --> 00:31:35,266
All right, Reilly, back her up.

314
00:31:36,307 --> 00:31:37,705
That's it.

315
00:31:39,785 --> 00:31:41,745
You need fuel.

316
00:31:44,625 --> 00:31:46,426
Geez, l need gas.

317
00:31:47,984 --> 00:31:49,264
Cut left. That's it.

318
00:31:49,345 --> 00:31:51,184
Hey, thanks.

319
00:31:56,784 --> 00:31:58,624
Look out!

320
00:32:00,704 --> 00:32:03,583
This must be my lucky--

321
00:32:12,702 --> 00:32:14,423
Call an ambulance!

322
00:32:14,622 --> 00:32:17,182
Scott, you all right?

323
00:32:17,542 --> 00:32:20,261
Hey, stay back! Stay back!

324
00:32:22,382 --> 00:32:24,261
Help over here!

325
00:32:42,500 --> 00:32:44,219
What's going on?

326
00:32:44,299 --> 00:32:47,939
lnspector Cardon is in charge, sir.
He's over there.

327
00:34:47,727 --> 00:34:49,886
Hey, what are you, crazy?

328
00:34:51,287 --> 00:34:52,847
-Out!
-Thank you.

329
00:34:58,566 --> 00:34:59,526
To the sanctum.

330
00:35:09,484 --> 00:35:11,045
Go!

331
00:35:12,165 --> 00:35:15,404
Come on, what are you gonna do,
park it here? Come on!

332
00:35:23,844 --> 00:35:26,364
Hey, Louie, save that cab for me!

333
00:36:12,838 --> 00:36:15,598
-Report.
-Our agent in the 26th precinct...

334
00:36:15,838 --> 00:36:19,998
...reports police investigation of murder
at the Museum of Natural History.

335
00:36:21,037 --> 00:36:21,958
Murder.

336
00:36:22,078 --> 00:36:23,718
Agent advises inquiry.

337
00:36:24,357 --> 00:36:26,117
Understood.

338
00:36:51,476 --> 00:36:53,354
l saw you as taller.

339
00:36:53,915 --> 00:36:55,035
Who are you?

340
00:36:55,155 --> 00:36:58,794
Shiwan Khan.
Last descendant of Genghis Khan.

341
00:37:00,834 --> 00:37:03,194
You are naturally deeply honored.

342
00:37:03,954 --> 00:37:07,354
Don't feel obligated to introduce yourself.
l already know who you are.

343
00:37:07,433 --> 00:37:10,032
Not this temporary version of yourself.

344
00:37:10,473 --> 00:37:13,592
l know who you really are.

345
00:37:14,712 --> 00:37:16,152
Ying Ko.

346
00:37:17,392 --> 00:37:19,632
l'm a great admirer.

347
00:37:21,232 --> 00:37:23,552
l don't know what you're talking about.

348
00:37:23,672 --> 00:37:24,792
Please.

349
00:37:25,271 --> 00:37:30,391
lt is no more difficult for me
to invade your mind than it was this room.

350
00:37:32,072 --> 00:37:33,790
May l sit?

351
00:37:36,431 --> 00:37:38,310
You are hurting my feelings, Ying Ko.

352
00:37:38,390 --> 00:37:41,310
l should have thought you would enjoy
to meet another...

353
00:37:41,391 --> 00:37:44,670
...with the unique ability
to cloud men's minds.

354
00:37:46,030 --> 00:37:48,309
-You were a student of the Tulku.
-Yes.

355
00:37:48,428 --> 00:37:50,549
He spoke of you constantly.

356
00:37:50,989 --> 00:37:55,468
But l'm afraid he wasn't able to
turn me quite as easily.

357
00:37:55,669 --> 00:37:59,708
Would you happen to have
some American bourbon?

358
00:38:00,747 --> 00:38:03,027
l have a bit of a taste for it.

359
00:38:03,507 --> 00:38:06,027
-l'm happy to pay, of course.
-No.

360
00:38:06,628 --> 00:38:07,787
Not at all.

361
00:38:11,787 --> 00:38:15,947
Say, you didn't happen by any chance to...

362
00:38:17,707 --> 00:38:20,706
...pay a visit to the museum
last night, did you?

363
00:38:22,226 --> 00:38:25,226
A wonderful collection
of Tibetan tapestries.

364
00:38:32,984 --> 00:38:36,304
Grown men still shiver at your name.

365
00:38:37,184 --> 00:38:40,464
You are, l have to confess, my idol.

366
00:38:41,343 --> 00:38:44,783
Your raid on the village of Barga?
l studied it.

367
00:38:45,864 --> 00:38:48,423
How nice. You remember it.

368
00:38:48,503 --> 00:38:49,863
lt rings a bell.

369
00:38:50,303 --> 00:38:52,423
lt was a masterstroke.

370
00:38:53,023 --> 00:38:55,782
Swift, vicious, and sudden.

371
00:38:57,542 --> 00:38:58,942
What genius.

372
00:39:02,502 --> 00:39:04,742
So, what brings you to the Big Apple?

373
00:39:05,862 --> 00:39:07,662
My destiny.

374
00:39:07,861 --> 00:39:11,380
Genghis Khan conquered half of the world
in his lifetime.

375
00:39:11,580 --> 00:39:13,901
l intend to finish the job.

376
00:39:14,741 --> 00:39:17,061
And how do you plan to do that?

377
00:39:17,580 --> 00:39:21,140
lf l told you, it wouldn't be a surprise.

378
00:39:22,540 --> 00:39:25,939
l traveled to this country
in Genghis Khan's holy crypt...

379
00:39:26,220 --> 00:39:28,139
...to absorb his power.

380
00:39:28,340 --> 00:39:32,499
ln three days,
the entire world will hear my roar...

381
00:39:32,699 --> 00:39:36,859
...and willingly fall subject
to the lost empire of Sianking.

382
00:39:38,418 --> 00:39:40,658
That is a lovely tie, by the way.

383
00:39:41,458 --> 00:39:44,497
-May l ask where you acquired it?
-Brooks Brothers.

384
00:39:44,898 --> 00:39:47,217
-ls that Midtown?
-45th and Madison.

385
00:39:47,697 --> 00:39:49,537
You are a barbarian.

386
00:39:50,458 --> 00:39:52,057
Thank you.

387
00:39:52,257 --> 00:39:54,497
We both are.

388
00:39:54,736 --> 00:39:57,857
l know that inside you beats
a heart of darkness.

389
00:39:58,136 --> 00:40:01,537
You dip into it every time
you put on that hat and cloak.

390
00:40:01,896 --> 00:40:03,056
Join me.

391
00:40:03,456 --> 00:40:06,255
You are Ying Ko, the Butcher of Lhasa.

392
00:40:06,776 --> 00:40:11,175
You and only you deserve to be
by my side.

393
00:40:12,375 --> 00:40:16,454
Together, we'll pit armies against
one another like a chess game.

394
00:40:16,694 --> 00:40:20,894
We'll collect our due of pain
and we'll wash our hands in blood.

395
00:40:21,494 --> 00:40:25,494
Your mouth still waters at real power.

396
00:40:25,774 --> 00:40:28,373
l am offering you a chance to take it back.

397
00:40:29,173 --> 00:40:31,734
Be my partner, Ying Ko.

398
00:40:32,853 --> 00:40:34,293
That's not my name anymore.

399
00:40:34,372 --> 00:40:37,893
But it is! Nevertheless,
still who you are, isn't it?

400
00:40:42,212 --> 00:40:43,691
For the bourbon.

401
00:40:44,012 --> 00:40:45,572
We will meet again, soon.

402
00:41:05,010 --> 00:41:07,969
The day of the Mongol warrior...

403
00:41:08,449 --> 00:41:10,689
...is once again at hand.

404
00:41:11,649 --> 00:41:15,609
Soon, with wings outstretched...

405
00:41:15,928 --> 00:41:17,888
...we fly to our destiny!

406
00:41:23,888 --> 00:41:25,447
Good morning, Mr. and Mrs. America.

407
00:41:25,528 --> 00:41:30,168
Flash: Manhattan reels from yet
another report of the elusive Shadow.

408
00:41:30,527 --> 00:41:34,527
l think they made up the Shadow
so people would listen to the radio more.

409
00:41:34,606 --> 00:41:36,607
What do you think, Roy?

410
00:41:36,686 --> 00:41:38,726
Some say the Shadow is....

411
00:41:38,965 --> 00:41:41,247
Roy?

412
00:41:41,526 --> 00:41:43,166
Well, it....

413
00:41:44,725 --> 00:41:47,245
l'll get it.

414
00:41:49,685 --> 00:41:51,645
Yes?

415
00:41:52,565 --> 00:41:55,004
''The sun is shining.''

416
00:41:55,964 --> 00:41:57,884
''But the ice is slippery.''

417
00:42:00,885 --> 00:42:03,324
-You're an agent of the Shadow.
-Who?

418
00:42:04,164 --> 00:42:06,403
Yeah. Right. Gotcha.

419
00:42:07,043 --> 00:42:08,684
What do you need?

420
00:42:08,883 --> 00:42:11,883
l need a metal analysis of this.

421
00:42:17,402 --> 00:42:19,202
Bronzium.

422
00:42:23,002 --> 00:42:25,842
The metal is bronzium.

423
00:42:26,082 --> 00:42:30,202
l didn't think it existed, but here it is.

424
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:38,160
The ancient Chinese believed this was
the very stuff the universe was formed of.

425
00:42:38,360 --> 00:42:41,761
-Where did it come from?
-l'm told it came from Sianking.

426
00:42:42,920 --> 00:42:46,159
lf you believed in legends,
it had to be Sianking.

427
00:42:46,600 --> 00:42:49,119
They called it the birthplace of the world.

428
00:42:49,759 --> 00:42:53,598
Could bronzium conceivably be used
to make some sort of a weapon?

429
00:42:54,599 --> 00:42:56,758
Theoretically, yes.

430
00:42:58,118 --> 00:42:59,119
How?

431
00:42:59,198 --> 00:43:02,598
Supposedly, it's very unstable
on the molecular level...

432
00:43:02,958 --> 00:43:04,677
...constantly given to expansion.

433
00:43:04,758 --> 00:43:08,358
Only the cell bonds hold it in check,
but if the bonds were ever breached.

434
00:43:08,438 --> 00:43:11,037
-By an explosion?
-lt wouldn't do it.

435
00:43:11,116 --> 00:43:14,678
But if the power of the cell were
to turn on itself in an implosion...

436
00:43:14,757 --> 00:43:18,596
...the molecular imbalance will be released
and then you'll have your explosion.

437
00:43:18,676 --> 00:43:19,956
How big?

438
00:43:22,795 --> 00:43:24,957
No man can say.

439
00:43:29,675 --> 00:43:34,034
The breakdown would spread to all levels
of the cells' atomic construction.

440
00:43:34,315 --> 00:43:37,155
Fashioned into a bomb,
it would be catastrophic.

441
00:43:38,274 --> 00:43:42,714
l guess you'd call it an implosive-explosive
submolecular device.

442
00:43:43,434 --> 00:43:44,834
Or an atomic bomb.

443
00:43:45,553 --> 00:43:47,713
Hey, that's catchy.

444
00:43:49,113 --> 00:43:52,672
But it'd have to have a beryllium sphere
to contain the apparatus.

445
00:43:52,753 --> 00:43:57,352
No other metal would enhance a blast.
ln any case, it's all moot.

446
00:43:57,792 --> 00:43:59,992
None of this would be possible...

447
00:44:00,952 --> 00:44:02,432
...unless...

448
00:44:02,832 --> 00:44:06,351
...some genius figures out how
to design and make it.

449
00:44:07,351 --> 00:44:09,351
The implosive device.

450
00:44:10,031 --> 00:44:12,311
lt would have to be sort of a shell...

451
00:44:12,471 --> 00:44:16,831
...with tiny implosive charges
regularly spread over the surface.

452
00:44:19,430 --> 00:44:21,830
Something like this.

453
00:44:23,470 --> 00:44:25,030
Fortunately...

454
00:44:25,749 --> 00:44:28,469
...such a device doesn't exist.

455
00:45:04,946 --> 00:45:08,465
Reinhardt Lane.

456
00:45:28,504 --> 00:45:32,904
Reinhardt Lane.

457
00:45:52,421 --> 00:45:56,621
Reinhardt Lane.

458
00:46:42,376 --> 00:46:46,175
Reinhardt Lane.

459
00:46:46,896 --> 00:46:48,696
Yes, my Khan.

460
00:46:52,295 --> 00:46:54,455
You know something, Lamont,
that puzzles me?

461
00:46:54,534 --> 00:46:58,175
How a man like yourself
who has absolutely nothing to do...

462
00:46:58,534 --> 00:47:01,294
...can be late for every little engagement.

463
00:47:02,214 --> 00:47:05,734
Practice, Uncle Wainwright.
Lots and lots of practice.

464
00:47:06,094 --> 00:47:09,614
Waiter, get me some more chives,
would you, please?

465
00:47:10,013 --> 00:47:13,574
Oh, my God, here comes that Lane woman.
l don't need her anymore, l--

466
00:47:13,653 --> 00:47:17,453
-Hi, Miss Lane. How are you?
-You can drop the act, Commissioner.

467
00:47:17,733 --> 00:47:21,852
-What have you done about my father?
-Nothing we can do unless--

468
00:47:22,012 --> 00:47:24,532
Unless what? He blows himself up?

469
00:47:25,612 --> 00:47:28,812
Margo Lane, my nephew, Lamont Cranston.

470
00:47:29,531 --> 00:47:30,811
Yes, we've met.

471
00:47:30,891 --> 00:47:33,651
Would you care to join us?

472
00:47:37,451 --> 00:47:40,331
The fact that your father
is acting strangely...

473
00:47:40,571 --> 00:47:43,369
...l don't think really calls for
a police investigation.

474
00:47:43,451 --> 00:47:45,650
l wanna see him.
The War Department says...

475
00:47:45,730 --> 00:47:49,050
...he suddenly decided to take no visitors,
not even his own daughter.

476
00:47:49,129 --> 00:47:52,329
Chances are he's working
on some top secret.

477
00:47:52,688 --> 00:47:56,089
-lt is a government project, you know.
-No, his project is harmless.

478
00:47:56,169 --> 00:47:58,808
Energy research.
Some kind of implosive device.

479
00:47:58,888 --> 00:48:02,209
Look, l know something's wrong.
l spoke to him on the phone.

480
00:48:02,369 --> 00:48:05,289
He was distant, confused, babbling.

481
00:48:06,807 --> 00:48:08,887
He spoke to me in Chinese!

482
00:48:10,527 --> 00:48:11,448
Waiter, waiter.

483
00:48:11,528 --> 00:48:14,927
-He doesn't even speak Chinese!
-l'm sorry, please.

484
00:48:15,446 --> 00:48:18,927
Tomorrow, l'll send a policeman
over to the federal building.

485
00:48:19,407 --> 00:48:22,646
He'll see your father
and everything'll be fine, all right?

486
00:48:23,046 --> 00:48:25,286
What's your opinion....

487
00:48:27,685 --> 00:48:29,086
Excuse me.

488
00:48:37,565 --> 00:48:39,165
Lamont!

489
00:48:42,604 --> 00:48:46,284
Wait a second, Lamont.
l wanted to ask you about my father.

490
00:48:48,004 --> 00:48:49,763
l have to go.

491
00:48:50,364 --> 00:48:53,723
Ying Ko! Who's Ying Ko?

492
00:48:58,363 --> 00:48:59,802
You will forget about me.

493
00:48:59,883 --> 00:49:03,922
-Why would l do that?
-You will give me no further thought.

494
00:49:05,002 --> 00:49:06,162
Are you drunk?

495
00:49:06,443 --> 00:49:09,441
l don't know what kind of woman
you're used to dealing with...

496
00:49:09,521 --> 00:49:11,642
...but l don't appreciate being--

497
00:49:12,321 --> 00:49:14,560
Hey!

498
00:49:15,041 --> 00:49:16,561
The federal building.

499
00:49:16,681 --> 00:49:18,720
You got it, boss.

500
00:49:48,478 --> 00:49:50,398
-Pizza?
-Yuck.

501
00:49:51,797 --> 00:49:54,197
l'm not going to eat a burger again.

502
00:49:54,278 --> 00:49:56,956
l'm not asking you to eat a burger.

503
00:50:04,436 --> 00:50:07,196
-You like fish?
-How about a burger?

504
00:51:11,070 --> 00:51:12,949
Next time, you get to be on top.

505
00:53:00,539 --> 00:53:03,098
-Where is Khan?
-l will not tell you.

506
00:53:03,818 --> 00:53:05,379
What are you doing?

507
00:53:06,378 --> 00:53:07,818
Hold on or you'll die!

508
00:53:07,898 --> 00:53:10,257
Yes, to serve my Khan.

509
00:53:13,337 --> 00:53:15,137
l sense somebody's coming.

510
00:53:30,935 --> 00:53:31,735
Drive!

511
00:53:44,055 --> 00:53:45,854
-Hello?
-Hello, Margo.

512
00:53:45,975 --> 00:53:46,895
Dad.

513
00:53:47,094 --> 00:53:49,894
-Are you all right?
-l'm fine.

514
00:53:50,614 --> 00:53:54,813
l need to see you right away at the lab.

515
00:53:55,333 --> 00:53:57,494
Are you there now?

516
00:53:57,973 --> 00:53:59,613
Hurry.

517
00:54:06,533 --> 00:54:09,451
No, no, no!

518
00:54:14,571 --> 00:54:17,051
Oh, God! Dad!

519
00:54:18,451 --> 00:54:21,131
Dad! Where are you?

520
00:54:21,491 --> 00:54:23,331
Oh, God, no!

521
00:54:38,289 --> 00:54:41,288
Margo Lane.

522
00:55:16,365 --> 00:55:19,206
l have a mission for you, my dear.

523
00:56:24,719 --> 00:56:26,918
Margo Lane.

524
00:56:27,518 --> 00:56:30,078
-What are you doing here?
-You're in my home.

525
00:56:30,318 --> 00:56:31,358
l am? Your home?

526
00:56:31,438 --> 00:56:33,357
-What are you doing here?
-l don't know.

527
00:56:33,437 --> 00:56:34,957
-Who sent you?
-l don't know!

528
00:56:35,038 --> 00:56:37,277
-Who sent you?
-l don't know!

529
00:56:37,357 --> 00:56:39,837
There was a voice over and over
in my head.

530
00:56:39,957 --> 00:56:42,037
lt said l had to kill the Shadow.

531
00:56:44,596 --> 00:56:46,557
l want you to leave right now.

532
00:56:47,796 --> 00:56:49,876
l had to kill the Shadow and l came here.

533
00:56:49,956 --> 00:56:52,235
l said l want you to leave right now.

534
00:56:53,515 --> 00:56:55,155
And there was only you.

535
00:56:56,315 --> 00:56:57,515
Get out!

536
00:56:57,594 --> 00:57:00,235
Let me see into your eyes.

537
00:57:01,874 --> 00:57:04,594
-You want to see into my eyes?
-l think--

538
00:57:04,675 --> 00:57:08,554
-Go ahead. Look at them.
-l know something l knew before.

539
00:57:08,634 --> 00:57:11,153
Something strange about you.
l could feel it.

540
00:57:11,354 --> 00:57:14,954
But l've got to warn you.
You won't like what you see.

541
00:57:15,313 --> 00:57:18,514
The static in my head
whenever l was near you. l knew it.

542
00:57:19,993 --> 00:57:21,673
You're the Shadow!

543
00:57:28,392 --> 00:57:32,871
My father's disappeared. You're
the only one who can help me find him.

544
00:57:34,432 --> 00:57:36,711
Just be gone when l get back.

545
00:57:39,352 --> 00:57:43,150
How do you know l won't tell anyone
who you really are?

546
00:57:44,230 --> 00:57:45,511
l know.

547
00:57:55,270 --> 00:57:55,910
To the sanctum.

548
00:59:49,058 --> 00:59:51,578
-Nice tie.
-Thank you.

549
01:00:01,057 --> 01:00:02,897
By the way...

550
01:00:03,416 --> 01:00:05,737
...you sent Margo Lane to kill me.

551
01:00:05,817 --> 01:00:06,897
Kill you?

552
01:00:07,097 --> 01:00:11,016
lf l wanted you dead, Ying Ko,
l would've had your liver on a pole by now.

553
01:00:11,096 --> 01:00:14,415
l sent the girl to be killed.
Tell me how did you kill her?

554
01:00:14,935 --> 01:00:17,575
-She's alive.
-Then she's a danger to you.

555
01:00:17,815 --> 01:00:21,415
She now knows exactly who you are.
How long will you let her live?

556
01:00:21,975 --> 01:00:25,654
How long before
your pure instincts take over?

557
01:00:27,294 --> 01:00:30,494
l'm onto your plan.
You still don't have the beryllium sphere.

558
01:00:30,574 --> 01:00:32,574
Without it, you can't complete the bomb.

559
01:00:32,654 --> 01:00:35,293
Besides, you know l'm gonna stop you.

560
01:00:35,494 --> 01:00:38,533
You Americans are so arrogant.

561
01:00:39,133 --> 01:00:41,373
You think your meaningless,
decadent country...

562
01:00:41,453 --> 01:00:43,732
...is the new cradle of civilization.

563
01:00:43,853 --> 01:00:47,612
-Let me tell you something--
-That's the U.S. of A. you're talking about.

564
01:00:47,693 --> 01:00:50,252
l am talking about ruling the world!

565
01:00:52,332 --> 01:00:53,891
l'd like to give you a name.

566
01:00:53,972 --> 01:00:56,411
Leonard Levinsky. Brilliant psychiatrist.

567
01:00:56,692 --> 01:00:59,530
-You'll talk, he'll listen--
-You are boring me!

568
01:01:01,931 --> 01:01:04,291
-That knife.
-Recognize it?

569
01:01:04,531 --> 01:01:06,331
l took it from the Tulku.

570
01:01:07,731 --> 01:01:09,610
No, l correct myself.

571
01:01:09,690 --> 01:01:14,690
l took it out of the Tulku
after l ran it through his heart.

572
01:01:16,290 --> 01:01:19,490
When will you learn
to listen to your instincts?

573
01:01:19,650 --> 01:01:21,489
lnstincts?

574
01:01:22,008 --> 01:01:23,849
l'll show you my instincts.

575
01:01:26,288 --> 01:01:28,528
Never did master the Phurba, did you?

576
01:01:28,648 --> 01:01:31,128
Still expect it to respond to brute force.

577
01:01:34,928 --> 01:01:37,727
My Mongol warriors aren't terribly bright...

578
01:01:38,927 --> 01:01:40,847
...but they are loyal.

579
01:01:41,847 --> 01:01:45,167
Accept the truth.
There is no light without shadow.

580
01:01:45,327 --> 01:01:47,926
And you and l are that shadow.

581
01:01:49,246 --> 01:01:52,166
l would sooner destroy a Rembrandt
than kill you.

582
01:01:52,646 --> 01:01:55,726
For the last time, will you join me?

583
01:01:55,926 --> 01:01:59,006
You cannot fool me.
You cannot defeat me.

584
01:01:59,165 --> 01:02:02,884
-Your mind is an open book to me.
-Then learn how to read!

585
01:02:05,725 --> 01:02:06,604
Weakling!

586
01:02:35,762 --> 01:02:37,921
Tail them, Moe.

587
01:02:47,761 --> 01:02:49,920
He's disappeared, boss.

588
01:02:51,400 --> 01:02:53,280
Stop the car.

589
01:03:49,275 --> 01:03:51,434
lt's just an empty lot, boss.

590
01:04:42,070 --> 01:04:45,029
l can't help that l know what l know
about you.

591
01:04:49,548 --> 01:04:51,828
And l can't forget it either.

592
01:05:01,747 --> 01:05:03,628
lt's late.

593
01:05:05,426 --> 01:05:08,547
Sleep here if you like.
There are guest rooms.

594
01:05:10,827 --> 01:05:13,026
But in the morning, you should go.

595
01:05:17,466 --> 01:05:19,825
l'm not afraid of you.

596
01:05:29,984 --> 01:05:31,825
But l am.

597
01:05:40,384 --> 01:05:42,743
Lamont?

598
01:05:48,342 --> 01:05:50,182
Lamont?

599
01:05:56,142 --> 01:05:57,981
Lamont?

600
01:06:35,338 --> 01:06:36,258
Oh, my God.

601
01:06:53,056 --> 01:06:54,776
Good morning.

602
01:06:54,976 --> 01:06:56,415
Good morning.

603
01:06:59,135 --> 01:07:01,815
Oh, God, l dreamed.

604
01:07:03,655 --> 01:07:04,935
So did l.

605
01:07:05,615 --> 01:07:07,215
What did you dream?

606
01:07:07,855 --> 01:07:10,934
l was lying naked on the beach
in the South Seas.

607
01:07:11,415 --> 01:07:14,294
The tide was coming up over my toes.

608
01:07:17,854 --> 01:07:20,253
The sun was beating down.

609
01:07:21,612 --> 01:07:22,934
My skin was...

610
01:07:24,693 --> 01:07:27,853
...hot and cool at the same time.

611
01:07:30,892 --> 01:07:33,253
lt was wonderful.

612
01:07:35,572 --> 01:07:36,812
What was yours?

613
01:07:37,292 --> 01:07:41,612
l dreamed l tore all the skin off my face
and was somebody else underneath.

614
01:07:43,091 --> 01:07:44,971
You have problems.

615
01:07:45,531 --> 01:07:47,410
l'm aware of that.

616
01:07:47,971 --> 01:07:50,010
l'll wait outside while you get dressed.

617
01:07:50,091 --> 01:07:52,410
That's okay. You can stay.

618
01:07:53,931 --> 01:07:56,090
These are all rumpled.

619
01:07:56,410 --> 01:08:00,650
There might be some things
in here that you could use.

620
01:08:00,889 --> 01:08:03,969
Yeah. This belonged to my aunt Rose.

621
01:08:04,210 --> 01:08:06,849
-Really?
-Very fashionable gal, that Rose.

622
01:08:07,609 --> 01:08:09,608
Kept her figure, too.

623
01:08:09,849 --> 01:08:11,448
l've got to run. l've got a--

624
01:08:11,528 --> 01:08:14,528
-Taxi waiting downstairs?
-Excuse me?

625
01:08:14,728 --> 01:08:17,567
l sensed that's what you were gonna say.
lt is, isn't it?

626
01:08:17,647 --> 01:08:18,607
Yes.

627
01:08:19,128 --> 01:08:21,687
This is getting easier the more l'm
around you.

628
01:08:21,767 --> 01:08:23,487
You're like reading a book.

629
01:08:23,727 --> 01:08:26,567
Thank you,
but l won't be needing that taxi.

630
01:08:26,966 --> 01:08:30,126
-You do. l have a very important--
-Great. l'll come with you.

631
01:08:30,326 --> 01:08:33,486
-No! Last night we agreed--
-No, l didn't agree to anything.

632
01:08:33,567 --> 01:08:36,806
Do you mind if l get
one little sentence out here?

633
01:08:36,886 --> 01:08:39,405
We agreed you were going to leave
this morning.

634
01:08:39,486 --> 01:08:43,325
No, you agreed l was going to leave.
l agreed to no such thing.

635
01:08:43,405 --> 01:08:45,005
-We need each other.
-No.

636
01:08:45,085 --> 01:08:46,565
-We have a connection.
-No.

637
01:08:46,644 --> 01:08:48,764
Then explain why l can read your thoughts.

638
01:08:48,845 --> 01:08:50,564
-My thoughts are hard to miss.
-Why?

639
01:08:50,644 --> 01:08:54,244
-Psychically, l'm very well-endowed.
-l'll bet you are.

640
01:08:54,484 --> 01:08:59,883
Okay, so you don't need me,
but l need you to help me find my father.

641
01:09:01,564 --> 01:09:04,283
And l am coming with you.

642
01:09:05,643 --> 01:09:06,843
Okay.

643
01:09:07,643 --> 01:09:09,282
Empire state building pennants!

644
01:09:09,363 --> 01:09:11,442
Get your empire state building pennants!

645
01:09:11,522 --> 01:09:15,122
From there to there.

646
01:09:15,362 --> 01:09:17,242
That is just the explosion.

647
01:09:17,562 --> 01:09:21,322
The destruction will be incalculable.

648
01:09:21,442 --> 01:09:24,961
Good.

649
01:09:26,201 --> 01:09:29,160
What a beautiful day.

650
01:09:29,521 --> 01:09:31,841
Nice dress, toots.

651
01:09:57,837 --> 01:10:00,958
-''Come on along and listen to...''
-Get me down!

652
01:10:01,037 --> 01:10:02,476
Bobby! What are you doing?

653
01:10:02,558 --> 01:10:05,797
l have no idea! Get me down!

654
01:10:06,237 --> 01:10:10,237
-Get me down from here!
-''...The Lullaby of Broadway.''

655
01:10:10,356 --> 01:10:13,356
Get me down!

656
01:10:15,596 --> 01:10:17,916
lt's all falling into place for me now.

657
01:10:18,076 --> 01:10:21,275
Shiwan Khan needs a beryllium sphere
to complete the bomb.

658
01:10:21,715 --> 01:10:24,635
-l wonder where he intends to find one?
-Beryllium sphere?

659
01:10:24,715 --> 01:10:26,955
Beryllium sphere! Farley Claymore!

660
01:10:27,275 --> 01:10:29,914
-What's that?
-Farley Claymore, my father's assistant.

661
01:10:29,995 --> 01:10:32,954
-He was working on a beryllium sphere.
-ln your father's lab?

662
01:10:33,035 --> 01:10:36,875
No, he was working on his own.
Mari-Tech labs, down on the south side.

663
01:10:37,434 --> 01:10:39,233
-Good, very good.
-Get outta the way!

664
01:10:39,314 --> 01:10:41,473
l got something else
l want you to do for me.

665
01:10:41,554 --> 01:10:45,114
l was trailing Khan when l lost him on
the corner of Second and Houston.

666
01:10:45,193 --> 01:10:47,553
There's something strange
about that vacant lot.

667
01:10:47,633 --> 01:10:49,233
Find out what used to be there.

668
01:10:49,313 --> 01:10:52,312
Second and Houston.
What about Farley Claymore?

669
01:10:52,673 --> 01:10:56,192
Mr. Claymore's gonna receive
a little visit from the Shadow.

670
01:11:10,591 --> 01:11:13,590
-Farley Claymore!
-Who's there?

671
01:11:13,950 --> 01:11:16,351
Where is the beryllium sphere, Claymore?

672
01:11:16,430 --> 01:11:18,269
Sphere?

673
01:11:19,229 --> 01:11:20,710
What sphere?

674
01:11:21,149 --> 01:11:25,309
Claymore, you idiot!
You're being manipulated.

675
01:11:25,789 --> 01:11:28,668
Your mind is being controlled by hypnosis.

676
01:11:29,189 --> 01:11:31,748
My mind? Controlled?

677
01:11:32,068 --> 01:11:34,628
What have you done with the sphere?

678
01:11:34,868 --> 01:11:37,468
lt's too late. l loaded it on a truck.

679
01:11:37,548 --> 01:11:39,907
Take me to it now!

680
01:11:49,186 --> 01:11:53,186
Who do you think you're gonna
shoot with that, Claymore?

681
01:12:06,625 --> 01:12:09,265
No one controls my mind, Shadow!

682
01:12:09,624 --> 01:12:13,665
There's a new world order coming,
and l'm gonna be a king.

683
01:12:14,184 --> 01:12:15,904
A king!

684
01:13:17,537 --> 01:13:18,898
Margo.

685
01:13:21,217 --> 01:13:22,457
Margo, l need you.

686
01:14:20,931 --> 01:14:22,411
Open the door.

687
01:14:52,649 --> 01:14:53,928
You called?

688
01:15:02,367 --> 01:15:03,567
Lamont?

689
01:15:26,245 --> 01:15:28,726
You're not supposed to be here.

690
01:15:55,563 --> 01:15:56,922
Lamont?

691
01:16:04,082 --> 01:16:05,961
You were dreaming.

692
01:16:12,481 --> 01:16:13,880
You saw.

693
01:16:20,560 --> 01:16:22,399
Do you have any idea...

694
01:16:23,279 --> 01:16:27,759
...what it's like to have done things
you can never forgive yourself for?

695
01:16:38,678 --> 01:16:41,037
Whoever you were...

696
01:16:41,518 --> 01:16:43,878
...whatever you did...

697
01:16:45,958 --> 01:16:48,277
...it's in the past.

698
01:16:49,997 --> 01:16:51,797
Not for me, Margo.

699
01:16:53,796 --> 01:16:55,316
Never for me.

700
01:17:01,876 --> 01:17:04,675
We are victorious!

701
01:17:05,994 --> 01:17:11,114
And as victors,
we will collect the spoils of war.

702
01:17:11,595 --> 01:17:15,074
l will remember each of you...

703
01:17:15,354 --> 01:17:18,473
...particularly my special servant...

704
01:17:19,034 --> 01:17:21,594
...the only American with genius enough...

705
01:17:21,914 --> 01:17:24,433
...to join me of his own free will...

706
01:17:29,193 --> 01:17:33,113
...who saw himself a king in my kingdom.

707
01:17:33,273 --> 01:17:36,352
King? Did l say king?

708
01:17:37,513 --> 01:17:41,151
-Maybe not the best choice of words.
-No, it wasn't.

709
01:17:41,472 --> 01:17:44,072
Because actually,
l was thinking prince, tops.

710
01:17:44,512 --> 01:17:48,431
Not even, necessarily. Duke? Baron?

711
01:17:48,912 --> 01:17:51,071
Your choice, of course.

712
01:17:52,710 --> 01:17:55,311
-Get Dr. Lane. Assemble the bomb.
-Of course.

713
01:17:55,631 --> 01:17:58,949
ln the name of the new Kha Khan!

714
01:17:59,390 --> 01:18:01,630
The power of God on Earth!

715
01:18:02,070 --> 01:18:06,390
The emperor of mankind!

716
01:18:18,468 --> 01:18:20,548
Extra! Read all about it!

717
01:18:20,627 --> 01:18:22,508
Madman threatens
to blow the city sky-high!

718
01:18:25,707 --> 01:18:29,027
Residents of New York City
were thrown into a virtual panic today.

719
01:18:29,106 --> 01:18:32,667
Police were still trying to determine if,
in fact, the threat was real...

720
01:18:32,747 --> 01:18:34,547
...or merely an incredible hoax.

721
01:18:34,626 --> 01:18:37,427
Either way, surely the work of a madman.

722
01:18:46,866 --> 01:18:48,385
Morning, Russell.

723
01:18:52,904 --> 01:18:57,305
He's demanded works of art,
famous jewels, even gold.

724
01:18:59,304 --> 01:19:01,465
Find Khan and you'll find the bomb.

725
01:19:01,544 --> 01:19:03,624
What did you find out about that lot?

726
01:19:03,704 --> 01:19:06,983
Not much. lt was the site
of the old Hotel Monolith.

727
01:19:07,064 --> 01:19:10,262
lt was finished nearly 10 years ago,
but it never opened.

728
01:19:10,383 --> 01:19:13,142
The Monolith. l vaguely remember that.

729
01:19:13,542 --> 01:19:16,223
Seems that's the only way
anybody remembers it.

730
01:19:16,302 --> 01:19:18,222
Before the hotel was completed...

731
01:19:18,303 --> 01:19:21,902
...the developer went bankrupt
and committed suicide.

732
01:19:23,542 --> 01:19:28,821
The last record is a sale
to a Far Eastern buyer six years ago.

733
01:19:30,261 --> 01:19:32,581
-When was it torn down?
-lt doesn't say.

734
01:19:32,661 --> 01:19:35,940
l made some calls this morning
to newspapers and such.

735
01:19:36,021 --> 01:19:39,580
All anybody can remember
is up to the time it was sold.

736
01:19:39,660 --> 01:19:41,940
Everyone seems to know
that it was torn down...

737
01:19:42,020 --> 01:19:46,339
...but they can't remember
when or by whom.

738
01:19:46,420 --> 01:19:47,779
Or if.

739
01:20:05,738 --> 01:20:07,457
l can't believe he did it.

740
01:20:07,897 --> 01:20:10,057
Did what? Lamont?

741
01:20:11,017 --> 01:20:13,058
My God.

742
01:20:29,616 --> 01:20:31,975
lt's beautiful.

743
01:20:32,134 --> 01:20:33,775
What is?

744
01:20:33,895 --> 01:20:38,214
Hey, that building right there.
What's the name of that building?

745
01:20:38,975 --> 01:20:40,574
Lunatic!

746
01:20:41,054 --> 01:20:44,534
Shiwan Khan has hypnotized
the entire city.

747
01:20:49,133 --> 01:20:50,933
They don't see it.

748
01:20:54,493 --> 01:20:56,372
None of them see it.

749
01:20:58,372 --> 01:21:00,132
But l see it.

750
01:21:01,292 --> 01:21:03,652
You and Shrevnitz
will receive your instructions.

751
01:21:03,731 --> 01:21:06,052
-l want you to follow them exactly.
-Lamont!

752
01:21:15,571 --> 01:21:18,930
Bet you wish you'd been a little nicer
to me now, don't ya?

753
01:21:19,010 --> 01:21:21,930
Bet you wish you'd listened to my ideas.

754
01:21:22,010 --> 01:21:25,529
Bet you didn't count on me being friends
with a conqueror, did ya?

755
01:21:25,610 --> 01:21:29,089
That's enough. Activate the bomb.

756
01:21:36,449 --> 01:21:38,608
Set the timer for two hours.

757
01:21:46,808 --> 01:21:50,848
You are certain you could duplicate
this bomb's design anytime l require?

758
01:21:51,087 --> 01:21:54,127
Absolutely. No problem.

759
01:21:54,207 --> 01:21:58,286
That makes Dr. Lane obsolete.
Secure him in a room.

760
01:21:58,367 --> 01:22:00,967
He will die at the hands
of his own invention.

761
01:22:01,127 --> 01:22:03,885
Yes, my Khan.

762
01:22:04,966 --> 01:22:09,165
l know you must have this covered,
but shouldn't we be getting out of here?

763
01:22:09,245 --> 01:22:14,165
There's an aeroplane waiting to take us
all to safety. We leave in one hour.

764
01:22:59,880 --> 01:23:02,200
What is it, Moe?

765
01:23:04,400 --> 01:23:06,760
ls it another one from the bowling league?

766
01:24:10,714 --> 01:24:11,834
Ying Ko.

767
01:24:13,074 --> 01:24:15,353
The Shadow! Where?

768
01:24:15,432 --> 01:24:18,553
Not here, you idiot. ln the building.

769
01:24:18,632 --> 01:24:21,352
Can you tell if he's mad at me?

770
01:24:21,433 --> 01:24:23,951
We had a little misunderstanding
yesterday...

771
01:24:24,032 --> 01:24:26,671
...and there might still be hard feelings.

772
01:24:28,552 --> 01:24:30,191
Find him and kill him!

773
01:24:30,752 --> 01:24:32,471
Kill him? Me?

774
01:24:32,672 --> 01:24:34,551
All of you!

775
01:24:36,631 --> 01:24:39,071
Couldn't l just stay here and help you?

776
01:24:39,150 --> 01:24:40,071
Go!

777
01:24:58,469 --> 01:25:00,948
You guys, go that way.

778
01:25:33,584 --> 01:25:37,304
Did you think you'd never see me again?

779
01:25:40,584 --> 01:25:42,384
l'm right here!

780
01:25:45,103 --> 01:25:47,224
All around you.

781
01:25:48,543 --> 01:25:50,623
Everywhere around you.

782
01:26:08,342 --> 01:26:09,782
Coward.

783
01:26:11,821 --> 01:26:13,981
Chicken! Sissy!

784
01:26:15,140 --> 01:26:18,341
Come out here and fight like a man.

785
01:26:47,778 --> 01:26:50,017
You're a fool, Claymore.

786
01:26:51,537 --> 01:26:53,897
Get out of my sight!

787
01:27:02,776 --> 01:27:05,096
There's your exit, Claymore.

788
01:27:22,374 --> 01:27:25,334
You know what l love about this job?

789
01:27:25,734 --> 01:27:27,334
The excitement.

790
01:27:37,773 --> 01:27:40,132
Ying Ko. l surrender.

791
01:27:40,493 --> 01:27:42,812
You're finished, Khan.

792
01:28:09,090 --> 01:28:10,409
Phurba!

793
01:28:37,207 --> 01:28:39,767
You are losing your concentration.

794
01:28:40,126 --> 01:28:42,606
Your mind is too weak.

795
01:28:42,967 --> 01:28:46,605
You are beginning to lose your power.

796
01:29:04,164 --> 01:29:08,204
Look at you. Can't even control yourself.

797
01:29:08,484 --> 01:29:10,804
How can you hope to control the Phurba?

798
01:29:40,001 --> 01:29:40,921
Stop!

799
01:29:55,958 --> 01:29:58,038
-My God.
-That's what he saw.

800
01:30:09,878 --> 01:30:10,758
Where am l?

801
01:30:55,913 --> 01:30:56,873
Khan!

802
01:31:11,791 --> 01:31:14,591
-Dad!
-Margo!

803
01:31:14,831 --> 01:31:17,951
-Where am l? What is going on here?
-Are you all right?

804
01:31:18,191 --> 01:31:20,671
Well, there's this guy....

805
01:31:21,310 --> 01:31:23,590
-l'll tell you later. Call the police.
-Okay.

806
01:31:34,950 --> 01:31:36,469
Look! There it is!

807
01:31:36,549 --> 01:31:40,309
Oh, my God! This is impressive work.

808
01:31:40,709 --> 01:31:43,309
-Who did this?
-You did.

809
01:31:43,748 --> 01:31:46,588
We only have an hour left. Disconnect it!

810
01:31:53,947 --> 01:31:55,546
Cut this off.

811
01:31:56,747 --> 01:31:58,867
Dad, the timer! You gotta stop it!

812
01:31:59,067 --> 01:32:00,467
Oh, dear.

813
01:32:05,906 --> 01:32:06,986
Two minutes left.

814
01:32:18,785 --> 01:32:20,865
Oh, my God! Hurry!

815
01:32:25,945 --> 01:32:27,144
This way!

816
01:32:33,143 --> 01:32:35,062
Oh, my God, it's upstairs.

817
01:32:44,743 --> 01:32:46,742
Oh, no, the elevator!

818
01:32:52,741 --> 01:32:53,701
Dad!

819
01:32:55,101 --> 01:32:55,982
Be careful.

820
01:33:03,740 --> 01:33:04,621
No!

821
01:33:10,260 --> 01:33:13,099
-Which wire?
-l just don't remember!

822
01:33:13,300 --> 01:33:14,780
Pick one!

823
01:33:15,779 --> 01:33:18,579
What the hell. lt's usually green.

824
01:33:20,178 --> 01:33:22,098
No, green!

825
01:33:23,498 --> 01:33:26,578
This is green. That's red.

826
01:33:26,897 --> 01:33:28,858
l've gotta try to remember that.

827
01:33:41,336 --> 01:33:42,217
What are you doing?

828
01:34:22,892 --> 01:34:24,932
Excuse me. Excuse me.

829
01:34:31,052 --> 01:34:33,331
Where the hell did that come from?

830
01:34:53,250 --> 01:34:55,089
What is this?

831
01:34:58,529 --> 01:35:00,690
Where am l?

832
01:35:02,488 --> 01:35:04,968
You. Come here.

833
01:35:06,368 --> 01:35:07,848
Look at me.

834
01:35:12,807 --> 01:35:14,807
Look into my eyes.

835
01:35:18,368 --> 01:35:19,687
Yes.

836
01:35:21,846 --> 01:35:23,286
Release me at once.

837
01:35:25,086 --> 01:35:27,486
No, we won't have any of that, Mr. Khan.

838
01:35:27,646 --> 01:35:30,045
Let's just have a look at those stitches.

839
01:35:30,126 --> 01:35:33,006
Stitches? What have you done?

840
01:35:33,525 --> 01:35:35,125
Saved your life, that's what.

841
01:35:35,206 --> 01:35:37,845
We had to remove a little section
of your frontal lobe.

842
01:35:37,925 --> 01:35:40,644
You'll never miss it.
lt's a part nobody ever uses.

843
01:35:40,725 --> 01:35:42,004
But....

844
01:35:43,725 --> 01:35:46,004
Unless you believe in telepathy!

845
01:35:46,244 --> 01:35:48,484
Wait! Come back here!

846
01:35:48,604 --> 01:35:50,444
You! Come here!

847
01:35:50,724 --> 01:35:55,723

of Genghis Khan! Listen to me!

848
01:35:55,843 --> 01:35:58,923

853
01:36:28,080 --> 01:36:31,000
Hey, how will you know where l am?

854
01:36:33,400 --> 01:36:35,239
