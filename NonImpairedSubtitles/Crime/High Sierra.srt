1
00:01:59,369 --> 00:02:01,929
I was getting nervous.
I've been waiting over an hour.

2
00:02:02,005 --> 00:02:04,235
I've been waiting, too, over eight years.

3
00:02:04,374 --> 00:02:06,535
- The park's down there, ain't it?
- Yeah.

4
00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:09,904
The park? Say, Earle, you feeling all right?

5
00:02:10,847 --> 00:02:14,715
I will be, just as soon as
I make sure that the grass is still green...

6
00:02:14,784 --> 00:02:17,218
and the trees are still growing.

7
00:03:12,942 --> 00:03:14,375
He ought to be here now.

8
00:03:15,511 --> 00:03:18,776
When he comes, you get in the bedroom
and stay there till he's gone.

9
00:03:18,848 --> 00:03:20,782
I've been hearing
about Roy Earle for years.

10
00:03:20,850 --> 00:03:23,648
He's a real big shot and I want to see him.

11
00:03:24,687 --> 00:03:26,279
Okay, okay.

12
00:03:31,794 --> 00:03:34,627
- Here they are now. Wally's brought him.
- All right, scram.

13
00:03:47,710 --> 00:03:48,904
Come in.

14
00:03:49,879 --> 00:03:51,676
Well, what kept you?

15
00:03:54,217 --> 00:03:56,208
You ain't losing your touch, are you?

16
00:03:57,420 --> 00:03:58,409
Where's Big Mac?

17
00:03:58,488 --> 00:04:01,013
He's gone to California.
I'm handling things here.

18
00:04:01,090 --> 00:04:03,650
- Who are you?
- I'm Kranmer, Jack Kranmer.

19
00:04:04,460 --> 00:04:06,860
- A copper, ain't you?
- I used to be. I resigned.

20
00:04:07,130 --> 00:04:08,188
I'll bet.

21
00:04:08,264 --> 00:04:11,097
I'm okay.
You don't have to worry about me.

22
00:04:12,135 --> 00:04:14,603
Since when has Big Mac
been teaming up with ex-coppers?

23
00:04:14,671 --> 00:04:16,161
I told you not to worry about that.

24
00:04:16,239 --> 00:04:18,400
Mac wants you to start
for California right away.

25
00:04:18,474 --> 00:04:20,738
That car downstairs is yours.
Here's the keys.

26
00:04:21,444 --> 00:04:23,241
Now here's your route and some dough.

27
00:04:23,313 --> 00:04:25,440
The sooner you get out there, the better.

28
00:04:25,581 --> 00:04:26,741
What's the setup?

29
00:04:26,849 --> 00:04:30,444
I don't suppose you ever heard
of Tropico Springs. It's a resort town.

30
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:32,715
They call it the richest little town
in the world.

31
00:04:32,789 --> 00:04:34,780
It has a hotel there,
gets all the top sugar.

32
00:04:34,857 --> 00:04:37,485
- You're gonna knock it off.
- Am I, copper?

33
00:04:37,994 --> 00:04:40,827
Now, look here, Earle,
Mac spent a fortune springing you.

34
00:04:40,897 --> 00:04:42,489
You're working for him now.

35
00:04:42,699 --> 00:04:44,997
He calls the tune and you dance to it.

36
00:05:27,810 --> 00:05:29,209
- Hello there.
- Howdy.

37
00:05:31,314 --> 00:05:33,339
Is there anything I can do for you?

38
00:05:33,416 --> 00:05:35,441
No, I was just looking around.

39
00:05:35,685 --> 00:05:37,983
- This is the old Earle place, ain't it?
- Yeah.

40
00:05:38,187 --> 00:05:41,520
But none of the Earles have been
around here for five or six years.

41
00:05:42,558 --> 00:05:44,116
You from the bank?

42
00:05:44,694 --> 00:05:46,321
No. I used to live near here.

43
00:05:46,662 --> 00:05:47,959
It's nice country.

44
00:05:48,197 --> 00:05:50,222
- Yeah.
- Howdy, son. Any luck?

45
00:05:50,933 --> 00:05:52,093
Not much.

46
00:05:52,168 --> 00:05:55,228
The best place to catch them
is that hole below the Turner place.

47
00:05:55,304 --> 00:05:58,068
Plenty big catfish in there.
Three or four pounds, maybe.

48
00:05:58,207 --> 00:06:00,767
Three or four pounds? Gee.

49
00:06:04,447 --> 00:06:06,938
Used to be, a long time ago, anyway.

50
00:06:07,383 --> 00:06:09,078
Maybe it's fished out.

51
00:06:15,324 --> 00:06:19,818
Why, you're Roy Earle, the bandit!

52
00:07:14,817 --> 00:07:17,285
Howdy, partner. What can I do for you?

53
00:07:17,353 --> 00:07:19,753
She'll take some water
and about 10 gallons of gas.

54
00:07:19,822 --> 00:07:20,811
Yes, sir.

55
00:07:21,557 --> 00:07:22,546
You bet.

56
00:07:26,562 --> 00:07:27,790
Hot day, ain't she?

57
00:07:28,764 --> 00:07:31,062
Ain't many cars coming through right now.

58
00:07:31,834 --> 00:07:33,699
Little early, I guess.

59
00:07:35,104 --> 00:07:37,470
You're looking at the pride
of the Sierras, brother.

60
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:40,441
Mount Whitney,
the highest peak in the United States.

61
00:07:40,843 --> 00:07:43,903
14,501 feet above sea level.

62
00:07:43,980 --> 00:07:46,676
Hey, I see you got an Illinois license plate.

63
00:07:46,749 --> 00:07:48,944
You're a long ways from home, ain't you?

64
00:07:50,119 --> 00:07:52,952
You must excuse me. I get lonesome here.

65
00:07:53,122 --> 00:07:56,523
And when a customer shows up,
well, maybe I talk too much.

66
00:07:56,726 --> 00:07:57,784
Lonesome, eh?

67
00:07:57,860 --> 00:08:00,454
Yes, I can see
how you would get lonesome out here.

68
00:08:11,207 --> 00:08:12,834
Wow, we made it!

69
00:08:12,942 --> 00:08:14,773
I'd sure like to shake your hand, sir.

70
00:08:14,844 --> 00:08:17,904
Jackrabbit jumped in front of my car
and I kind of lost my head.

71
00:08:18,014 --> 00:08:21,780
- You sure saved our bacon.
- I saved my own bacon, too. Come far?

72
00:08:21,851 --> 00:08:23,819
- Clear from Ohio. And you?
- Chicago.

73
00:08:23,886 --> 00:08:27,151
I'm mighty proud to make your
acquaintance. You sure can handle a car.

74
00:08:27,223 --> 00:08:29,282
Me, I'm kind of shaky at it, but Velma...

75
00:08:29,592 --> 00:08:31,958
Velma's my granddaughter,
she's a good driver...

76
00:08:32,028 --> 00:08:34,656
but she gets tired
and I won't let her drive too much.

77
00:08:35,565 --> 00:08:37,658
- What's your name, sir?
- Collins.

78
00:08:37,733 --> 00:08:39,257
Mine's Goodhue.

79
00:08:39,969 --> 00:08:42,403
Velma, Ma, I'd like you
to meet Mr. Collins.

80
00:08:42,471 --> 00:08:43,495
- How do?
- How do you do?

81
00:08:43,573 --> 00:08:44,835
Pleased to meet you.

82
00:08:45,041 --> 00:08:47,635
Well, I guess I'll be on my way.

83
00:08:49,111 --> 00:08:50,339
Out of $5.

84
00:08:50,413 --> 00:08:51,437
Going far?

85
00:08:51,514 --> 00:08:53,243
Up in the mountains for my health.

86
00:08:53,316 --> 00:08:56,774
Well, I'm going to Los Angeles.
I lost my farm back home.

87
00:08:57,019 --> 00:09:01,285
But Velma's mother married again
and she sort of invited us out.

88
00:09:01,357 --> 00:09:05,987
- Now, I don't know...
- $2.41, $3, $4, $5.

89
00:09:07,763 --> 00:09:09,128
I hope you make it.

90
00:10:24,807 --> 00:10:26,468
- Hey, you.
- Yes, sir?

91
00:10:26,542 --> 00:10:28,271
I'm looking for a fellow named Hattery.

92
00:10:28,344 --> 00:10:30,278
He's staying up here,
him and another fellow.

93
00:10:30,346 --> 00:10:33,577
They all in cabin 12.
Are you the gentleman they expecting?

94
00:10:33,649 --> 00:10:36,277
Then you'll be in cabin number 11.
Leave your car here.

95
00:10:36,352 --> 00:10:39,879
I'll drain the water out of it
'cause it gets awful cold up here at night.

96
00:10:39,955 --> 00:10:41,422
Get my bags. They're in the back.

97
00:10:41,490 --> 00:10:43,219
I'll take care of them, boss.

98
00:11:05,448 --> 00:11:07,006
Hattery here?

99
00:11:11,921 --> 00:11:13,582
There's someone to see you.

100
00:11:17,259 --> 00:11:18,453
You Roy Earle?

101
00:11:19,862 --> 00:11:23,195
Glad to see you. I can't shake hands.
I've been cleaning fish.

102
00:11:23,632 --> 00:11:25,600
Meet my pal, Babe Kozak.

103
00:11:26,502 --> 00:11:27,969
This is Marie Garson.

104
00:11:31,874 --> 00:11:34,342
Red, I want to talk to you alone.
See you later.

105
00:11:35,344 --> 00:11:37,005
It's okay by me.

106
00:11:41,784 --> 00:11:43,615
You don't like the idea of the dame, huh?

107
00:11:43,686 --> 00:11:45,483
Even guys like you ought to know better.

108
00:11:45,554 --> 00:11:47,749
Babe picked her up
at a dime-a-dance joint in L.A.

109
00:11:47,823 --> 00:11:50,849
She's strictly okay.
She just sort of looks after things for us.

110
00:11:50,926 --> 00:11:54,123
Give her some dough and send her back.
Get her out of here tonight.

111
00:11:54,230 --> 00:11:55,629
Now, what about this job?

112
00:11:55,698 --> 00:11:59,327
The tropical season is just starting,
and Mendoza, he's our inside man...

113
00:11:59,402 --> 00:12:02,235
he says that the hotel
will be full up in another week.

114
00:12:02,304 --> 00:12:05,171
And there'll be plenty of rocks
in the strong boxes then.

115
00:12:05,241 --> 00:12:08,142
- When do I see Mendoza?
- He'll be up the first day he gets off.

116
00:12:08,210 --> 00:12:10,735
- He's in touch with Big Mac, too.
- Oh, he is?

117
00:12:10,813 --> 00:12:13,873
- He'll give you all the news firsthand.
- All right.

118
00:12:14,316 --> 00:12:15,442
Say, Mr. Earle?

119
00:12:15,985 --> 00:12:18,078
I wanted to tell you
that with you on the job...

120
00:12:18,154 --> 00:12:20,281
we feel like we're traveling
in fast company.

121
00:12:20,356 --> 00:12:21,755
I sure heard a lot about you.

122
00:12:21,824 --> 00:12:25,487
One time, when I was only a kid,
I saw your picture in the paper...

123
00:12:28,998 --> 00:12:31,933
You can have your Roy Earle.
He don't look like much to me.

124
00:12:32,568 --> 00:12:33,762
He's getting gray.

125
00:12:33,836 --> 00:12:37,328
He may be a powerhouse to some people,
but he's a blown-out fuse to me!

126
00:12:37,406 --> 00:12:39,033
I'll bet he's plenty tough.

127
00:12:39,241 --> 00:12:40,902
Get out of line and you'll see.

128
00:12:41,377 --> 00:12:42,742
All right, I'll see.

129
00:12:43,145 --> 00:12:44,271
Let me tell you something...

130
00:12:44,346 --> 00:12:47,213
you're getting so
you're asking for a smack in the nose.

131
00:12:47,283 --> 00:12:50,081
- Stop arguing with me all the time.
- I got bad news for you.

132
00:12:50,152 --> 00:12:52,313
Roy says we gotta send Marie back to L.A.

133
00:12:52,388 --> 00:12:54,049
Why, that broken-down...

134
00:12:54,523 --> 00:12:55,820
- I'll tell him.
- Yeah?

135
00:12:56,058 --> 00:12:57,582
Well, here's your chance.

136
00:12:57,860 --> 00:12:59,828
You don't want me to go back to L.A.,
do you?

137
00:12:59,895 --> 00:13:01,795
- You go and tell him.
- I don't know.

138
00:13:02,465 --> 00:13:04,456
I suppose we need that guy.

139
00:13:04,533 --> 00:13:07,058
But that's no reason
for him to push us around.

140
00:13:07,136 --> 00:13:08,626
He's no more the boss than we are.

141
00:13:08,704 --> 00:13:10,569
- He can't get away...
- Go on, keep it up.

142
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:12,163
You're gonna win this argument.

143
00:13:12,374 --> 00:13:14,934
Leave her alone!
You go smacking her, I'll flatten you!

144
00:13:15,010 --> 00:13:17,035
- And who else?
- Me! You think it ain't enough?

145
00:13:17,112 --> 00:13:20,172
Cut it out. You'll get nothing
out of fighting but a black eye.

146
00:13:20,249 --> 00:13:23,309
I don't care what you or anyone else says,
she's not going to L.A.

147
00:13:23,385 --> 00:13:25,615
That's what you think. He thinks different.

148
00:13:25,688 --> 00:13:29,146
I'm not gonna be sent back
to that dime-a-dance joint if I can help it.

149
00:13:29,558 --> 00:13:33,016
- I'll go talk to him.
- With him, I don't think it'll work.

150
00:13:51,447 --> 00:13:53,074
Can I talk to you a moment, Mr. Earle?

151
00:13:53,148 --> 00:13:54,843
Sure. Help yourself.

152
00:14:00,723 --> 00:14:02,816
Why do you want to send me back to L.A.?

153
00:14:02,925 --> 00:14:04,153
I like it here.

154
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:06,851
- Don't play dumb.
- I don't intend to.

155
00:14:08,197 --> 00:14:11,758
Oh, I know what's going on,
but I didn't get it from them.

156
00:14:12,568 --> 00:14:14,195
Louis Mendoza told me.

157
00:14:14,803 --> 00:14:16,964
He talks too much, and all he does is brag.

158
00:14:18,140 --> 00:14:21,906
So you see, Mr. Earle, Mendoza's the one
for you to worry about, not me.

159
00:14:26,682 --> 00:14:29,810
I ain't worrying about you.
It's them jitterbugs you got with you.

160
00:14:29,952 --> 00:14:32,079
They'll be throwing lead over you
before long.

161
00:14:32,221 --> 00:14:34,348
Oh, I can handle them all right.

162
00:14:34,490 --> 00:14:37,857
Babe gets tough every once in a while,
but he's afraid of Red.

163
00:14:38,027 --> 00:14:40,052
And I can make Red think what I want.

164
00:14:40,362 --> 00:14:42,694
You got it all figured out, ain't you?

165
00:14:43,032 --> 00:14:44,795
In a way.

166
00:14:46,468 --> 00:14:47,457
All right.

167
00:14:49,638 --> 00:14:53,199
Let things stay as they are
for a few days and see how it works out.

168
00:14:53,275 --> 00:14:54,902
Oh, thanks, Mr. Earle.

169
00:15:04,186 --> 00:15:05,175
Goodbye.

170
00:15:40,556 --> 00:15:44,515
Morning. This is me, Algernon.
Anything I can do for you this morning?

171
00:15:44,593 --> 00:15:46,356
You can rustle me up some breakfast.

172
00:15:46,428 --> 00:15:48,521
The lady next door
got your breakfast all ready.

173
00:15:48,597 --> 00:15:52,260
She thought maybe I ought to see
if you was sort of stirring around.

174
00:15:53,302 --> 00:15:55,793
Where did you ever get
the name Algernon?

175
00:15:55,871 --> 00:15:57,998
My old lady thought it up. Pip, ain't it?

176
00:15:58,073 --> 00:15:59,540
Kind of gives me class.

177
00:16:02,378 --> 00:16:03,675
How you like this dog?

178
00:16:03,746 --> 00:16:06,909
- Why, he's just a dog, ain't he?
- No, sir, mighty fine dog, he is.

179
00:16:06,982 --> 00:16:09,610
Watch now. Pard, ducks!

180
00:16:13,689 --> 00:16:14,678
Down.

181
00:16:15,758 --> 00:16:17,020
Up.

182
00:16:19,962 --> 00:16:21,054
Jump.

183
00:16:22,498 --> 00:16:24,363
Yes, sir, mighty fine animal, he is.

184
00:16:24,867 --> 00:16:26,562
Kind of proud of your dog, ain't you?

185
00:16:26,635 --> 00:16:28,227
Oh, no, sir, he ain't my dog.

186
00:16:28,303 --> 00:16:30,567
He just took a liking to me
and follows me around.

187
00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:33,130
- Sort of gets me worried, too.
- Why?

188
00:16:33,375 --> 00:16:35,741
You see, Pard here
used to belong to a woodcutter...

189
00:16:35,811 --> 00:16:37,779
who lived up here all the year round.

190
00:16:37,846 --> 00:16:42,476
Last winter, a snow slide come down
on that man's house and killed him dead.

191
00:16:42,551 --> 00:16:43,609
Didn't kill Pard, though.

192
00:16:43,686 --> 00:16:46,553
So a man saw Pard sort of wandering
around in the snow like...

193
00:16:46,622 --> 00:16:50,080
took him in. If that man
don't up and die with the pneumonia.

194
00:16:50,959 --> 00:16:53,018
Great, big, strapping man, too.

195
00:16:53,095 --> 00:16:55,427
So Pard got to hanging
around the lodges...

196
00:16:55,497 --> 00:16:57,727
and doggone if Miss Tucker
didn't come up here...

197
00:16:57,933 --> 00:16:58,922
with the...

198
00:17:00,569 --> 00:17:03,367
And I hear yesterday she ain't gonna live.

199
00:17:03,439 --> 00:17:07,705
So I'm just telling you about Pard,
in case you want him for your own dog.

200
00:17:11,447 --> 00:17:14,314
- Can I come in?
- Yeah.

201
00:17:15,784 --> 00:17:18,514
Is he breaking your heart
with the story of the little mutt?

202
00:17:18,587 --> 00:17:20,214
It's the Lord's truth.

203
00:17:20,289 --> 00:17:22,416
Look at him. He's a born panhandler.

204
00:17:22,491 --> 00:17:24,391
Everyone here stuffs him so it's getting...

205
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:26,485
he won't eat anything else
but a New York cut.

206
00:17:26,562 --> 00:17:28,052
I guess I'll get back to the stove.

207
00:17:28,130 --> 00:17:30,155
Pard'll stay here with you,
won't you, Pard?

208
00:17:35,637 --> 00:17:38,231
- Sit down, have a cigarette.
- Thanks.

209
00:17:38,507 --> 00:17:41,101
- Where are your boyfriends?
- Oh, they're out fishing.

210
00:17:41,176 --> 00:17:42,336
That's about all they do.

211
00:17:42,411 --> 00:17:45,278
They never catch anything,
but they just keep on fishing.

212
00:17:45,347 --> 00:17:47,178
Yes, he certainly is spoiled.

213
00:17:47,249 --> 00:17:50,241
Yeah, look at him.
He knows we're talking about him.

214
00:17:51,220 --> 00:17:55,179
Well, I feel pretty good this morning.
I felt rotten last night.

215
00:17:55,357 --> 00:17:57,450
Nothing like a good night's sleep
to pep you up.

216
00:17:57,526 --> 00:18:00,393
What you ought to do is get out in the sun.
Do you good.

217
00:18:00,529 --> 00:18:03,157
Where I was before,
they didn't let me get out in the sun.

218
00:18:03,232 --> 00:18:06,065
Afraid I might spoil my girlish complexion.

219
00:18:06,468 --> 00:18:08,060
It must be terrible to be in prison.

220
00:18:08,137 --> 00:18:09,661
Some of them are worse than others.

221
00:18:09,738 --> 00:18:12,798
You get a mean guard down on you,
unless you got what it takes...

222
00:18:12,875 --> 00:18:15,400
you might as well climb up
on tier two and jump off.

223
00:18:15,477 --> 00:18:16,967
Some of them did.

224
00:18:17,045 --> 00:18:19,206
- I don't get you.
- Top of the cell block.

225
00:18:19,281 --> 00:18:22,182
It's a 40-foot drop
and you land on concrete.

226
00:18:22,551 --> 00:18:24,178
I saw a guy take a dive once.

227
00:18:25,487 --> 00:18:27,079
He made quite a splash.

228
00:18:27,156 --> 00:18:29,147
Yeah. That must be awful.

229
00:18:29,558 --> 00:18:31,458
He just didn't have what it takes.

230
00:18:31,527 --> 00:18:33,995
I was doing the book myself,
but I got a break.

231
00:18:34,062 --> 00:18:37,122
How was it?
I mean, knowing you're in for life.

232
00:18:38,233 --> 00:18:40,724
- I should think you'd go crazy.
- Yeah.

233
00:18:40,936 --> 00:18:42,494
Lots of them do.

234
00:18:42,671 --> 00:18:44,571
But I was always thinking
about a crash-out.

235
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:48,076
I tried it once at the prison farm
where they sent me for good behavior.

236
00:18:48,143 --> 00:18:51,442
But the fix blew up
and a screw put the blast on me.

237
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:55,172
Yeah, then the worst of it was
they sent me back behind those big walls.

238
00:18:55,250 --> 00:18:58,981
We were just getting ready for another
crash-out when my pardon came.

239
00:19:00,856 --> 00:19:02,084
Yeah, I get it.

240
00:19:03,592 --> 00:19:05,992
You always hope you can get out.

241
00:19:06,428 --> 00:19:09,124
That sort of keeps you going.

242
00:19:09,598 --> 00:19:12,567
Yeah, sure, that's it.

243
00:19:13,202 --> 00:19:14,464
You got it.

244
00:19:15,504 --> 00:19:17,529
Well, I'll get you some more coffee.

245
00:19:18,140 --> 00:19:20,165
Thanks for the chow.

246
00:19:29,017 --> 00:19:30,678
You see that fellow over there?

247
00:19:33,188 --> 00:19:35,383
He better watch his steps
and fish on the bank...

248
00:19:35,457 --> 00:19:38,051
cause that little old dog's
got the hex on him for sure.

249
00:19:38,126 --> 00:19:39,957
Gonna put the evil eye on him, huh?

250
00:19:40,028 --> 00:19:41,518
Yes, the evil eye.

251
00:19:41,597 --> 00:19:43,792
That little old dog's got the evilest eye.

252
00:19:43,866 --> 00:19:47,495
His left eye just shines
in the dark just like a cat's eye.

253
00:19:47,569 --> 00:19:50,800
Algernon, if it's in the dark,
how do you know which eye's which?

254
00:19:56,812 --> 00:20:00,043
Come on, Mendoza. What are we doing,
playing cards or taking a nap?

255
00:20:00,115 --> 00:20:02,640
I am sorry. For the moment,
my mind was not on the game.

256
00:20:02,718 --> 00:20:04,276
That's for me. Thanks, Louis.

257
00:20:04,419 --> 00:20:06,683
Dumb luck. Just plain dumb luck.

258
00:20:06,755 --> 00:20:09,121
Maybe if you wouldn't kick so much
you'd do better.

259
00:20:09,191 --> 00:20:11,284
- It's all in the cards.
- Yeah, that's right.

260
00:20:11,393 --> 00:20:13,827
Oh, Roy, this here's Louis Mendoza.

261
00:20:15,197 --> 00:20:16,789
Delighted, Mr. Earle.

262
00:20:16,865 --> 00:20:19,527
Come on, Mendoza,
let's finish out this hand.

263
00:20:19,801 --> 00:20:21,063
That's a baby.

264
00:20:21,637 --> 00:20:24,231
There's that dumb luck again.
I can't beat it.

265
00:20:25,173 --> 00:20:26,936
What does it look like at the hotel?

266
00:20:27,009 --> 00:20:28,203
How soon do we go?

267
00:20:28,277 --> 00:20:29,744
Oh, it won't be long now.

268
00:20:30,012 --> 00:20:32,139
The racing season is starting up north.

269
00:20:32,314 --> 00:20:35,442
And all the big shots
have been making reservations.

270
00:20:36,985 --> 00:20:38,282
This is the layout.

271
00:20:44,393 --> 00:20:45,655
I don't know.

272
00:20:46,962 --> 00:20:50,159
Babe and I kind of figured
our best getaway was over the pass.

273
00:20:50,432 --> 00:20:53,560
Nobody will ever expect us
to cross the Sierras to get into L.A.

274
00:20:53,735 --> 00:20:55,794
Suppose it would blow up a storm?

275
00:20:56,138 --> 00:20:58,834
If the pass got blocked up, then what?

276
00:20:58,941 --> 00:21:00,704
Yeah, that's right.

277
00:21:01,810 --> 00:21:05,246
By the way,
I dropped in to see Big Mac yesterday.

278
00:21:05,514 --> 00:21:07,141
- He wants to see you.
- All right.

279
00:21:07,215 --> 00:21:10,412
I'll take a look at the hotel tomorrow.
I'll drive in and see him.

280
00:21:10,485 --> 00:21:12,680
I almost forgot.
Mendoza brought us a present.

281
00:21:12,754 --> 00:21:14,483
Roy, I guess you're the engineer.

282
00:21:14,556 --> 00:21:17,423
Big Mac gave me the machine gun.
You know how to work it?

283
00:21:17,492 --> 00:21:19,050
Red doesn't, and neither does Babe.

284
00:21:19,127 --> 00:21:20,424
That's a good one, that is.

285
00:21:20,495 --> 00:21:23,362
- What's so funny?
- Does he know how to work it?

286
00:21:24,266 --> 00:21:25,358
Yeah.

287
00:21:26,101 --> 00:21:29,537
Say, you know that gun reminds me
of one time, nine or 10 years ago.

288
00:21:29,604 --> 00:21:32,630
We was getting ready to do a job
back in lowa...

289
00:21:32,708 --> 00:21:34,767
when one of the guys got the shakes.

290
00:21:34,876 --> 00:21:38,607
Pretty soon, we found out that this guy
with the shakes had talked too much...

291
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:41,171
and a bunch of cops are waiting
for us at the bank.

292
00:21:41,249 --> 00:21:43,376
But we don't say nothing.

293
00:21:43,585 --> 00:21:45,644
Lefty Jackson goes out and gets his gun.

294
00:21:46,321 --> 00:21:49,347
He comes back and sits down
and holds it across his knee.

295
00:21:50,092 --> 00:21:53,653
The guy with the shakes
is sitting right across the room from him.

296
00:21:53,729 --> 00:21:57,187
Pretty soon,
Lefty just touched the trigger a little...

297
00:21:57,466 --> 00:21:59,934
and the gun went like that.

298
00:22:01,370 --> 00:22:05,067
The rat fell out of his chair, dead,
and we drove off and left him there.

299
00:22:05,974 --> 00:22:08,499
Yeah, the gun just went...

300
00:22:18,186 --> 00:22:20,211
I guess I ought to be getting back.

301
00:22:20,288 --> 00:22:23,314
- I have to go on duty at 8:30.
- What's your stunt?

302
00:22:23,392 --> 00:22:25,553
You stick right through
the whole job, don't you?

303
00:22:25,627 --> 00:22:28,357
Sure, I stand behind the desk
and act like I'm scared.

304
00:22:28,430 --> 00:22:31,524
When you fellows get through,
I telephone the police.

305
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:33,431
We don't want no slip-ups, Mendoza.

306
00:22:40,075 --> 00:22:44,478
Boys and girls, I got the idea
that our boyfriend here is no cream puff.

307
00:22:44,613 --> 00:22:48,515
How'd you like the little bedtime
story about the gun that went...

308
00:22:48,850 --> 00:22:51,819
- Did you get the idea?
- Do you suppose he meant it that way?

309
00:22:52,154 --> 00:22:53,849
Try talking and find out.

310
00:23:55,050 --> 00:23:56,381
I'll take a pack of these.

311
00:23:56,451 --> 00:23:58,476
25 cents, please.

312
00:24:07,229 --> 00:24:08,491
Yes, sir.

313
00:24:15,070 --> 00:24:17,903
- Anything in 316?
- 316...

314
00:24:30,719 --> 00:24:32,084
They don't care how they drive.

315
00:24:32,154 --> 00:24:33,917
They've got no money, no insurance.

316
00:24:33,989 --> 00:24:35,479
- It's murder.
- Tough luck, Pfiffer.

317
00:24:35,557 --> 00:24:38,025
If he weren't an old dodo,
I'd take it out of his hide.

318
00:24:38,093 --> 00:24:41,153
- He wasn't driving. The girl was driving.
- I was.

319
00:24:41,296 --> 00:24:43,764
What's an outfit like that doing
in Tropico, anyhow?

320
00:24:43,832 --> 00:24:46,130
- It's a State Highway, ain't it?
- The signal was on.

321
00:24:46,201 --> 00:24:48,032
- He had his hand out here.
- You didn't!

322
00:24:48,103 --> 00:24:50,094
Wait a minute.
Will you let me get a word in?

323
00:24:50,172 --> 00:24:52,265
I was driving along...

324
00:24:52,340 --> 00:24:53,466
Why, Roy!

325
00:24:53,575 --> 00:24:55,736
- Friends of yours?
- Yeah. Why?

326
00:24:55,810 --> 00:24:58,677
I wondered. I know I've no chance
to collect, but I'm curious.

327
00:24:58,747 --> 00:25:00,442
I pull out from the curb and I get hit.

328
00:25:00,515 --> 00:25:02,779
- Look at my fender.
- But you didn't make no signal.

329
00:25:02,851 --> 00:25:05,843
You talk about collecting.
Be careful, you may have to pay off.

330
00:25:05,921 --> 00:25:09,550
A wise guy in on this, huh?
All right, have it your own way.

331
00:25:09,624 --> 00:25:11,785
I'll charge the whole thing
off to experience.

332
00:25:11,860 --> 00:25:12,952
What's the matter?

333
00:25:13,028 --> 00:25:15,724
I got clipped,
but I'm satisfied if this guy is.

334
00:25:15,797 --> 00:25:18,891
Well, I guess if Mr. Pfiffer's satisfied, I am.

335
00:25:18,967 --> 00:25:22,300
All right, come on, let's break this up.
Back on the sidewalk.

336
00:25:22,404 --> 00:25:24,770
Listen, fellow.
These people ain't got any dough.

337
00:25:24,839 --> 00:25:27,433
They're on their way to L.A.
And that car's all they got.

338
00:25:27,509 --> 00:25:29,033
Stop it. You're breaking my heart.

339
00:25:29,110 --> 00:25:32,568
- $50 ain't gonna mean much to you.
- Sorry, but not a quarter.

340
00:25:32,647 --> 00:25:34,740
That's right, Mr. Pfiffer.
Saw the whole thing.

341
00:25:34,816 --> 00:25:36,477
That girl was driving the car.

342
00:25:40,188 --> 00:25:41,746
Look, she's a cripple, too.

343
00:25:58,473 --> 00:26:00,407
I guess it was really Velma's fault.

344
00:26:00,475 --> 00:26:02,375
She was gawking around,
looking at things...

345
00:26:02,444 --> 00:26:05,004
and smacked right into that fellow's car.

346
00:26:05,080 --> 00:26:08,379
I was sure surprised when he gave you
that $100 to give me.

347
00:26:08,516 --> 00:26:11,349
I wouldn't worry about him, Pa.
He's probably got plenty.

348
00:26:11,586 --> 00:26:14,453
Well, this is the second time
you saved our lives, son.

349
00:26:14,522 --> 00:26:17,855
When Velma smashed into that car,
I had 13 cents in my pocket...

350
00:26:17,926 --> 00:26:19,917
and a $5 bill in my shoe.

351
00:26:19,995 --> 00:26:22,555
Of course, the women didn't know it.
Don't you tell them.

352
00:26:22,631 --> 00:26:24,292
Pa, you're all right.

353
00:26:25,367 --> 00:26:27,699
You said you came
from Chicago, didn't you, Roy?

354
00:26:27,769 --> 00:26:31,068
I came out here from Chicago,
but I'm really from Brookfield, Indiana.

355
00:26:31,139 --> 00:26:33,403
- Born there, went to school there.
- A little town?

356
00:26:33,475 --> 00:26:35,067
- Yeah.
- I knew it.

357
00:26:35,143 --> 00:26:36,371
My folks had a farm.

358
00:26:36,444 --> 00:26:39,709
I said to Ma out there in the desert,
you was our kind.

359
00:26:40,181 --> 00:26:43,173
Yes, sir. I can tell them every time.

360
00:26:44,019 --> 00:26:45,247
- Say, Pa?
- Yeah?

361
00:26:47,022 --> 00:26:49,422
Excuse me,
I suppose it's none of my business...

362
00:26:50,525 --> 00:26:52,720
but what's wrong with Velma's foot?

363
00:26:52,794 --> 00:26:56,286
- It's a clubfoot, she was born that way.
- Can't nothing be done about it?

364
00:26:56,364 --> 00:26:59,993
One time a doctor said she could be
operated, but the last few years...

365
00:27:00,068 --> 00:27:02,263
I've been so broke,
we couldn't if we'd wanted to.

366
00:27:02,337 --> 00:27:05,329
We hurried with the dishes.
We knew Pa'd be talking your ear off.

367
00:27:05,407 --> 00:27:07,034
Pa sure can talk.

368
00:27:07,842 --> 00:27:09,400
Isn't the air grand out here?

369
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:13,006
Look at the stars.

370
00:27:13,948 --> 00:27:16,109
I never knew
there were so many in the sky.

371
00:27:16,951 --> 00:27:18,976
Back home
you couldn't see them like that.

372
00:27:19,054 --> 00:27:21,318
It's always like this out in the desert.

373
00:27:21,389 --> 00:27:25,348
You see that bright blue star up there?
Look at it sparkle.

374
00:27:28,963 --> 00:27:30,624
- You see that other one?
- Where?

375
00:27:30,699 --> 00:27:31,723
Right there.

376
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:33,267
Oh, I see it.

377
00:27:33,668 --> 00:27:35,067
That's Jupiter.

378
00:27:36,771 --> 00:27:38,033
How do you know?

379
00:27:39,874 --> 00:27:43,605
A fellow I used to know,
he taught me all about the sky...

380
00:27:44,379 --> 00:27:46,813
and where we was,
we didn't have much else to do.

381
00:27:46,881 --> 00:27:48,906
Is that star always up there like that?

382
00:27:49,050 --> 00:27:51,382
No. You see different stars
at different times.

383
00:27:51,453 --> 00:27:54,047
They change with the seasons. Now, look.

384
00:27:54,689 --> 00:27:56,680
You see that one twinkling over there?

385
00:27:56,791 --> 00:27:58,088
Well, that's Venus.

386
00:27:59,728 --> 00:28:02,754
It makes you dizzy just looking at them.

387
00:28:04,165 --> 00:28:07,965
Sometimes when you're out
in the night and you look up at the stars...

388
00:28:08,236 --> 00:28:11,171
you can almost feel
the motion of the earth.

389
00:28:11,239 --> 00:28:14,470
It's like a little ball
that's turning through the night...

390
00:28:14,676 --> 00:28:16,644
with us hanging onto it.

391
00:28:17,245 --> 00:28:20,305
Why, that sounds like poetry, Roy.
It's pretty.

392
00:28:24,352 --> 00:28:28,015
Well, I guess I better be starting.
I got a long drive ahead of me.

393
00:28:28,223 --> 00:28:30,316
Got a business appointment in L.A.

394
00:28:30,592 --> 00:28:32,219
I sure enjoyed that dinner.

395
00:28:32,394 --> 00:28:34,385
And we sure enjoyed your company.

396
00:28:34,496 --> 00:28:36,760
Now, don't you fail to look us up
in Los Angeles.

397
00:28:36,831 --> 00:28:38,992
We might get lonesome. Especially Velma.

398
00:28:39,267 --> 00:28:42,464
Grandpa, you shouldn't say things
like that. I'm surprised at you.

399
00:28:42,537 --> 00:28:45,802
I declare to goodness,
the older you get, the sillier you act.

400
00:28:45,874 --> 00:28:49,105
Roy understands me.
Me and Roy's old-timers.

401
00:28:49,544 --> 00:28:51,944
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye, Roy.

402
00:29:00,355 --> 00:29:02,380
Lucky girl that gets him.

403
00:29:28,917 --> 00:29:29,906
Come in.

404
00:29:42,330 --> 00:29:44,389
I've got a swell parley
for you tomorrow, Doc.

405
00:29:44,466 --> 00:29:46,366
Still a sucker for the ponies?

406
00:29:47,302 --> 00:29:50,271
- Hello, Roy, old-timer!
- Hello, Mac.

407
00:29:50,338 --> 00:29:54,468
- You're a sight for sore eyes.
- Yeah, I sure am glad to see you, too.

408
00:29:54,943 --> 00:29:55,967
Thanks for the spring.

409
00:29:56,044 --> 00:29:59,013
I was just getting ready
for another crash-out.

410
00:29:59,080 --> 00:30:02,641
- What's the matter, Mac?
- Oh, I don't know. I can't eat.

411
00:30:03,384 --> 00:30:06,182
Just ain't hungry. And I can't sleep.

412
00:30:06,955 --> 00:30:09,583
Doc Banton says it's my past life
catching up with me.

413
00:30:11,359 --> 00:30:13,589
- Doc Banton, is he out here now?
- Yeah.

414
00:30:13,661 --> 00:30:15,788
I was expecting him when you came in.

415
00:30:15,930 --> 00:30:18,728
He's running one of those health services
under a phony name.

416
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:20,791
Help yourself to a drink.

417
00:30:21,636 --> 00:30:24,537
Well, Roy, how does it look
and what do you say?

418
00:30:24,606 --> 00:30:26,233
I can't see nothing wrong with it.

419
00:30:26,307 --> 00:30:29,367
If the boys don't blow up on me,
it's a cinch.

420
00:30:29,644 --> 00:30:32,670
But, Mac, it's gonna make
an awful big noise in the newspapers.

421
00:30:32,747 --> 00:30:34,715
Well, that's your headache, not mine.

422
00:30:34,849 --> 00:30:36,009
The jewelry.

423
00:30:36,084 --> 00:30:37,813
That's all I'm interested in.

424
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:40,979
Now look, Roy,
once you get your mitts on it...

425
00:30:41,289 --> 00:30:42,950
keep your mitts on it.

426
00:30:43,291 --> 00:30:46,692
Deliver it right here.
If you're hot, telephone.

427
00:30:47,695 --> 00:30:49,287
This caper means a lot to me.

428
00:30:49,898 --> 00:30:53,129
I spent a pile of dough setting it up,
and I'm in deep.

429
00:30:53,201 --> 00:30:54,828
So don't let me down, Roy.

430
00:30:54,903 --> 00:30:57,167
I never let nobody down, Mac.
You know that.

431
00:30:57,839 --> 00:30:59,204
Oh, I know.

432
00:30:59,274 --> 00:31:02,266
But I've been dealing
with such a lot of screwballs lately.

433
00:31:02,343 --> 00:31:05,244
Young twerps, soda-jerkers and jitterbugs.

434
00:31:06,147 --> 00:31:09,412
Why, it's a relief
just to talk to a guy like you.

435
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:14,320
All the A-1 guys are gone.

436
00:31:14,956 --> 00:31:17,516
Dead or in Alcatraz.

437
00:31:19,627 --> 00:31:22,755
If I only had four guys like you, Roy...

438
00:31:23,698 --> 00:31:25,996
this knock-over would be a waltz.

439
00:31:28,937 --> 00:31:31,428
Times have sure changed.

440
00:31:31,773 --> 00:31:33,400
Yeah, ain't they?

441
00:31:34,242 --> 00:31:39,009
You know, Mac, sometimes I feel like
I don't know what it's all about anymore.

442
00:31:41,783 --> 00:31:44,843
Yeah, times have sure changed.

443
00:31:47,188 --> 00:31:48,780
Hide the booze.

444
00:31:54,662 --> 00:31:56,289
Well, hello, Mac.

445
00:31:56,464 --> 00:31:58,898
Hello, Doc. Look who's here.

446
00:32:00,001 --> 00:32:04,529
Well, I'll be. Roy Earle, the old boy himself.

447
00:32:04,739 --> 00:32:05,728
Hello, Doc.

448
00:32:05,807 --> 00:32:09,834
Last time I saw you was when I was
taking slugs out of Lefty Jackson's chest.

449
00:32:09,911 --> 00:32:12,505
- Yeah, that's right.
- Oh, those were the times.

450
00:32:13,181 --> 00:32:15,081
Not many of the old bunch left.

451
00:32:15,183 --> 00:32:16,650
Cut it out.

452
00:32:16,718 --> 00:32:19,516
Mac tells me you're doing all right, Doc.

453
00:32:20,688 --> 00:32:23,282
This is the land of milk
and honey for the health racket.

454
00:32:23,358 --> 00:32:24,916
Every woman in California thinks...

455
00:32:24,993 --> 00:32:28,190
she's either too fat or too thin
or too something.

456
00:32:31,265 --> 00:32:33,130
Same dosage, same medicine.

457
00:32:33,468 --> 00:32:35,663
- Need a new prescription?
- No.

458
00:32:36,904 --> 00:32:39,702
- Good night, Mac.
- Good night, Doc.

459
00:32:44,012 --> 00:32:45,502
He's in a bad way, Old Mac.

460
00:32:45,613 --> 00:32:47,638
Bum ticker, kidneys on the blink...

461
00:32:47,715 --> 00:32:50,548
bad stomach,
like a kid's toy that's running down.

462
00:32:50,752 --> 00:32:53,846
I try to keep him from drinking,
but there's no stopping Old Mac.

463
00:32:53,921 --> 00:32:56,822
He'll go on doing
just as he always has done.

464
00:32:57,325 --> 00:32:59,190
Well, maybe he's right.

465
00:32:59,594 --> 00:33:01,084
- Say, Doc.
- Yeah?

466
00:33:01,229 --> 00:33:03,561
- There's something I wanted to ask you.
- Yeah?

467
00:33:03,965 --> 00:33:06,399
Can anything be done about a clubfoot?

468
00:33:06,467 --> 00:33:09,197
Some can be operated
and some can't. Why?

469
00:33:09,337 --> 00:33:11,362
A good friend of mine's
got a granddaughter.

470
00:33:11,439 --> 00:33:13,407
She's a mighty nice girl.

471
00:33:13,474 --> 00:33:17,308
One time a doctor told her old man
that an operation could fix it.

472
00:33:17,378 --> 00:33:19,005
I was just wondering if...

473
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:21,708
- Young kid, is she?
- About 20, I guess.

474
00:33:21,916 --> 00:33:24,976
Twenty. I see.

475
00:33:25,586 --> 00:33:28,680
My advice, Roy,
is to forget all about her foot.

476
00:33:28,756 --> 00:33:32,590
- Look, Doc, I ain't kidding.
- I'll have to see her.

477
00:33:32,894 --> 00:33:35,055
Will you take a look if I can talk her into it?

478
00:33:35,129 --> 00:33:36,494
Sure. Of course, Roy.

479
00:33:36,564 --> 00:33:40,159
I can't do any operating,
but I can get you someone who will.

480
00:33:40,234 --> 00:33:44,261
- It'll cost you plenty, though.
- Okay, Doc. I'll give you a ring.

481
00:33:44,338 --> 00:33:45,828
Good. Do that, Roy.

482
00:33:45,907 --> 00:33:50,901
And I'll make you a present of my fee,
for old times' sake.

483
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:53,975
- Good night.
- Good night, Doc.

484
00:34:00,888 --> 00:34:04,119
- I don't know, Mac, the...
- Yeah, I do.

485
00:34:10,898 --> 00:34:14,595
There. I feel better. That's the works.

486
00:34:15,970 --> 00:34:18,404
Now, if anything should happen to me...

487
00:34:18,473 --> 00:34:21,067
read this letter
and you'll know what to do.

488
00:34:21,142 --> 00:34:22,939
As the Doc told you...

489
00:34:23,010 --> 00:34:26,446
if I don't lay off this stuff
it's gonna knock me off.

490
00:34:26,647 --> 00:34:28,672
But I'm gonna die, anyhow.

491
00:34:30,084 --> 00:34:32,575
So are you. So are we all.

492
00:34:34,689 --> 00:34:36,316
Your health, Roy.

493
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:49,065
- Hello, Roy.
- Hello, Pa.

494
00:34:49,135 --> 00:34:50,397
Glad to see you.

495
00:34:50,470 --> 00:34:53,200
This is the Doc,
Mr. Parker, of the New Health Institute.

496
00:34:53,273 --> 00:34:55,673
- Proud to meet you, Mr. Parker.
- How do you do?

497
00:34:55,742 --> 00:34:58,438
- He's kind of an expert, knows his stuff.
- Yeah?

498
00:34:58,511 --> 00:35:00,672
After you called up I spoke to them all...

499
00:35:00,747 --> 00:35:04,444
and I think I've got Velma on my side,
but Ma is against it.

500
00:35:05,485 --> 00:35:09,888
Please excuse things, the way they look.
We're just getting straightened out.

501
00:35:09,956 --> 00:35:12,117
- Roy, this is Mabel.
- How do you do?

502
00:35:12,192 --> 00:35:16,060
This is her husband, Carl.
This is Mr. Parker, Mabel.

503
00:35:16,396 --> 00:35:17,454
How do you do?

504
00:35:17,530 --> 00:35:19,555
- Hello, Roy.
- Hello, Velma.

505
00:35:20,700 --> 00:35:23,726
Say, I'd like you to meet Mr. Parker.

506
00:35:23,803 --> 00:35:25,532
- How do you do?
- Velma.

507
00:35:25,605 --> 00:35:28,335
You say, "Mr. Parker."
Isn't he even a doctor?

508
00:35:28,408 --> 00:35:30,569
I am a specialist.

509
00:35:31,845 --> 00:35:35,246
You should be thankful someone's
trying to do something for your girl.

510
00:35:35,315 --> 00:35:36,782
You've nothing to say about this.

511
00:35:36,850 --> 00:35:39,785
Velma's my girl,
and I'm thinking, if he isn't even a doctor...

512
00:35:39,853 --> 00:35:42,651
He can look at her, can't he?
That won't hurt nothing.

513
00:35:42,722 --> 00:35:45,088
I don't think Velma wants him
to look at her.

514
00:35:45,158 --> 00:35:48,559
- Do you, dear?
- Pa wants him to. So does Roy.

515
00:35:48,628 --> 00:35:50,459
Who is this Roy, anyway?

516
00:35:50,530 --> 00:35:53,021
You know all about Roy.
If it hadn't been for him...

517
00:35:53,099 --> 00:35:55,499
Why does he go to so much trouble
to help strangers?

518
00:35:55,568 --> 00:35:57,001
He must have some reason.

519
00:35:57,070 --> 00:36:01,006
Maybe he likes Velma.
She ain't married yet, and likely not to be.

520
00:36:01,074 --> 00:36:03,975
- And if you want my opinion...
- We don't want your opinion.

521
00:36:04,044 --> 00:36:06,569
Look, you got Velma all upset
talking like that.

522
00:36:06,646 --> 00:36:09,206
All right.

523
00:36:09,349 --> 00:36:13,149
Don't worry. If you don't want him
to see your foot you don't have to let him.

524
00:36:13,219 --> 00:36:14,481
But I do.

525
00:36:14,554 --> 00:36:17,717
Okay. If the child's made up her mind,
I've nothing more to say.

526
00:36:17,791 --> 00:36:20,157
Come along, Mr. Parker. Come on, Ma.

527
00:36:20,226 --> 00:36:21,853
This way, Doctor.

528
00:36:25,331 --> 00:36:29,131
If this here specialist
says he can operate on Velma, what then?

529
00:36:29,202 --> 00:36:32,638
- Operations cost money.
- I'll loan you the money.

530
00:36:33,106 --> 00:36:35,233
I could never pay it back. You know that.

531
00:36:35,308 --> 00:36:38,277
- I ain't worrying about that.
- I know.

532
00:36:38,878 --> 00:36:41,210
Anybody with eyes in their head.

533
00:36:41,347 --> 00:36:45,044
She's pretty, ain't she?
And just as sweet as she's pretty.

534
00:36:46,753 --> 00:36:49,483
Are you figuring on marrying Velma, Roy?

535
00:36:49,756 --> 00:36:52,281
I ain't got that far in my figuring.

536
00:36:53,460 --> 00:36:57,055
I don't know what's the right thing to do,
but it seems to me...

537
00:36:57,130 --> 00:37:01,089
before you go putting out money,
I ought to tell you about Velma.

538
00:37:03,136 --> 00:37:04,660
What about her?

539
00:37:07,073 --> 00:37:11,066
She's got a fellow back home.
His name's Preiser.

540
00:37:11,177 --> 00:37:14,669
He's about 30 years old
and already divorced.

541
00:37:15,515 --> 00:37:19,417
He's doing good in the insurance business,
but it didn't look right...

542
00:37:19,486 --> 00:37:22,978
a divorced man running around
with a crippled girl.

543
00:37:23,056 --> 00:37:26,958
So Ma and me brings Velma
out here to her mother.

544
00:37:27,794 --> 00:37:31,787
Now, it's my guess that
Velma's still thinking about that fellow.

545
00:37:32,198 --> 00:37:34,928
Now mind,
I don't think there's anything wrong.

546
00:37:35,001 --> 00:37:39,199
I'm always telling myself there wasn't.
It makes me feel better.

547
00:37:41,074 --> 00:37:43,668
That's about all there is to it, Roy.

548
00:37:44,511 --> 00:37:46,945
I hope you ain't sore or anything.

549
00:37:49,382 --> 00:37:52,249
No, I ain't sore at nobody.

550
00:37:53,553 --> 00:37:57,785
I guess it sounds funny,
and I ain't got the right words to fit it...

551
00:37:58,725 --> 00:38:03,458
but it seems as if I'd been close to Velma
for a million years.

552
00:38:04,197 --> 00:38:06,188
And knowing her like I do...

553
00:38:06,266 --> 00:38:10,100
nobody ain't ever gonna tell me
she's ever done a wrong thing.

554
00:38:10,436 --> 00:38:12,768
'Cause I know, you understand?

555
00:38:12,972 --> 00:38:15,463
Now, she's not to know
you ever told me anything.

556
00:38:15,542 --> 00:38:17,601
All right, Roy, anything you say.

557
00:38:17,677 --> 00:38:19,338
Roy, he says it can be fixed.

558
00:38:19,412 --> 00:38:23,007
There's nothing serious. We'll soon have
her walking as well as anybody.

559
00:38:23,082 --> 00:38:25,676
Jiminy Cricket! Ain't that wonderful, Ma?

560
00:38:25,752 --> 00:38:28,380
Now, honey, you just thank Roy.
Roy's the one.

561
00:38:28,454 --> 00:38:31,946
He thought up the whole thing,
and he's lending me the money.

562
00:38:32,025 --> 00:38:35,517
You, Mr. Collins? You, why, I...

563
00:38:36,262 --> 00:38:39,356
I mean, I hope you'll excuse
the way I acted...

564
00:38:39,432 --> 00:38:42,060
but I've been so worried about Velma,
poor child.

565
00:38:42,135 --> 00:38:43,568
After all, I am her mother and...

566
00:38:43,636 --> 00:38:45,934
Mr. Parker here
will take care of everything.

567
00:38:46,005 --> 00:38:48,439
You got nothing to worry about, Velma.

568
00:38:48,508 --> 00:38:49,873
Roy, you're so good.

569
00:38:49,943 --> 00:38:52,036
Pa says you're the best man
that ever lived.

570
00:38:52,111 --> 00:38:54,011
And I guess Pa's right.

571
00:38:57,517 --> 00:38:58,745
Goodbye.

572
00:39:02,088 --> 00:39:03,680
Darnedest fellow.

573
00:39:09,229 --> 00:39:12,096
It's criminal nothing's ever been done
for that girl before.

574
00:39:12,165 --> 00:39:16,261
It's a simple enough operation.
I got an in with the best surgeon in town.

575
00:39:16,336 --> 00:39:19,032
The whole thing will set you back
about $400, though.

576
00:39:19,105 --> 00:39:22,302
- You satisfied?
- Yeah, sure, I'm satisfied.

577
00:39:22,375 --> 00:39:24,309
But I'm giving it to you straight.

578
00:39:24,377 --> 00:39:27,676
You're just sticking your neck out.
She's not your kind, you know it.

579
00:39:27,747 --> 00:39:29,374
And she's gonna throw an awful fit...

580
00:39:29,449 --> 00:39:32,316
when she finds out
what kind of a guy you really are.

581
00:39:32,385 --> 00:39:35,354
- Yeah, I know.
- You may catch lead any minute.

582
00:39:35,421 --> 00:39:39,482
What you need is a fast-stepping
young filly you can keep up with.

583
00:39:40,026 --> 00:39:43,792
Remember what Johnny Dillinger said
about guys like you and him?

584
00:39:43,863 --> 00:39:46,331
He said you were
just rushing toward death.

585
00:39:46,399 --> 00:39:49,368
Yeah, that's it. Just rushing toward death.

586
00:40:03,950 --> 00:40:06,885
What's the matter, Pard,
you been hiding out?

587
00:40:29,909 --> 00:40:31,877
- Is that you, Roy?
- Yeah.

588
00:40:32,245 --> 00:40:35,043
- Is Pard with you?
- Yeah, he's right here.

589
00:40:36,516 --> 00:40:38,177
You had me scared.

590
00:40:40,586 --> 00:40:43,350
- What are you doing in there?
- Come on in.

591
00:40:43,423 --> 00:40:47,223
I'm glad Pard is all right.
I was afraid Babe had killed him.

592
00:40:55,034 --> 00:40:57,696
- Did he do that?
- Yeah, he went crazy.

593
00:40:58,237 --> 00:41:01,070
Red tried to cool him off,
but he fought like a wildcat.

594
00:41:01,140 --> 00:41:04,166
And he picked up a poker
and hit Red over the head with it.

595
00:41:04,243 --> 00:41:06,370
When Red was down,
he swung at me twice.

596
00:41:06,446 --> 00:41:09,540
- Were these guys fighting over you?
- Red was standing up for me.

597
00:41:09,615 --> 00:41:11,708
- When was this?
- About dark.

598
00:41:12,118 --> 00:41:13,210
Where are they?

599
00:41:13,286 --> 00:41:16,847
As soon as Babe knocked Red cold,
he started running for the store.

600
00:41:16,923 --> 00:41:20,484
Then I heard Pard barking,
and Babe threw a poker at him.

601
00:41:21,394 --> 00:41:25,797
So I ran over here and locked myself in.
I found this under your pillow.

602
00:41:25,865 --> 00:41:28,493
I figured if Babe sneaked back,
I could hold him off.

603
00:41:28,568 --> 00:41:31,503
- He was like a crazy guy.
- Give me that. You stay here.

604
00:41:31,571 --> 00:41:35,837
- You'll only get yourself in a jam.
- Shut up and lock this door behind me.

605
00:41:53,393 --> 00:41:55,293
- Roy.
- Give me that gun.

606
00:41:55,595 --> 00:41:58,155
- Nobody's gonna push me around.
- Give it to me.

607
00:41:58,231 --> 00:42:00,358
- Is he in there?
- He's scared to come out.

608
00:42:00,433 --> 00:42:02,458
- You were gonna kill him?
- He hit my head...

609
00:42:02,535 --> 00:42:05,163
You wait right here. I'll handle this.

610
00:42:13,679 --> 00:42:17,775
I had him hooked good. He was all
played out and I'm reaching for my net.

611
00:42:17,850 --> 00:42:20,978
Good night, fellows. Here's my pal.
I guess I'll get along.

612
00:42:21,053 --> 00:42:23,715
Good night, son.
I hope tomorrow you get a 10-pounder.

613
00:42:23,790 --> 00:42:25,815
- Yeah, thanks.
- Good night.

614
00:42:29,629 --> 00:42:32,928
- You stinking rat.
- I know, I went crazy. Marie, she tried to...

615
00:42:32,999 --> 00:42:35,490
Yeah, that's right. Blame the dame. Go on.

616
00:42:56,823 --> 00:43:00,520
Here he is. Mark him up.
Swing on him. Hit him with this.

617
00:43:06,566 --> 00:43:09,763
No, I don't want to hurt him.

618
00:43:13,873 --> 00:43:17,104
Roy, don't hurt him.
He won't act like that again.

619
00:43:17,276 --> 00:43:20,609
Your car's outside. If I was you,
I'd beat it, and quick. Both of you.

620
00:43:20,680 --> 00:43:22,614
Roy, we been counting on this job.

621
00:43:22,682 --> 00:43:25,651
I'm giving you a chance to blow.
If you decide to stick...

622
00:43:25,718 --> 00:43:28,152
I'll shoot the first one
that don't do as I tell him.

623
00:43:28,221 --> 00:43:30,212
Okay, Roy. Come on, Babe.

624
00:43:43,469 --> 00:43:45,869
I'm not going back to the cabin.

625
00:43:46,038 --> 00:43:49,997
You better not.
Trouble would just start all over again.

626
00:43:50,176 --> 00:43:52,406
Look, I found a cot in the woodshed.

627
00:43:52,478 --> 00:43:55,072
I can fix it up
and sleep here in the kitchen.

628
00:43:55,147 --> 00:43:56,478
All right.

629
00:43:57,116 --> 00:44:00,745
I'll have Algernon get you clothes
and I'll send you home tomorrow.

630
00:44:15,868 --> 00:44:16,892
No.

631
00:44:19,872 --> 00:44:21,203
No, I say.

632
00:44:22,575 --> 00:44:24,236
You can't hold me.

633
00:44:27,813 --> 00:44:31,749
Take the gates away. I'm crashing out.

634
00:44:35,454 --> 00:44:36,819
Yeah, sure.

635
00:44:40,526 --> 00:44:42,619
I'll go back to the farm...

636
00:44:43,262 --> 00:44:46,197
sweet Indiana farm.

637
00:44:47,033 --> 00:44:50,935
But you're holding me back.
Don't hold me back.

638
00:44:52,238 --> 00:44:54,331
I'll crash out, I tell you.

639
00:44:55,875 --> 00:44:59,003
You can't.

640
00:45:00,279 --> 00:45:03,373
No, you can't do it.

641
00:45:03,749 --> 00:45:08,152
Farm's the best. Yeah, that's the best.

642
00:45:09,722 --> 00:45:13,556
You can't take it away. You can't.

643
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:23,225
- Little more coffee?
- Yeah.

644
00:45:24,070 --> 00:45:26,061
What, are you all packed?

645
00:45:29,408 --> 00:45:30,739
I thought maybe I could...

646
00:45:30,810 --> 00:45:34,007
I'll run you over to Ballard.
You can catch a bus.

647
00:45:34,180 --> 00:45:36,114
I haven't got a soul in L.A.

648
00:45:36,182 --> 00:45:38,480
- Where you from?
- San Francisco.

649
00:45:38,718 --> 00:45:40,743
- Family there?
- Yeah.

650
00:45:41,253 --> 00:45:43,687
Maybe I can stake you to a ticket.

651
00:45:47,159 --> 00:45:50,026
Remember what you were saying
the other day about prison...

652
00:45:50,096 --> 00:45:54,556
and the way you kept from going crazy
by thinking all the time about a crash-out?

653
00:45:54,634 --> 00:45:56,693
That's the way it's been with me.

654
00:45:56,769 --> 00:46:00,296
I've been trying to crash out
ever since I can remember.

655
00:46:00,573 --> 00:46:03,599
My old man used to get drunk
a couple of times a week...

656
00:46:03,676 --> 00:46:06,839
and kick us around.
My old lady used to stand it.

657
00:46:07,480 --> 00:46:10,677
But not me.
I waited for my chance, and I beat it.

658
00:46:11,350 --> 00:46:14,649
- I crashed out, just like you did.
- I got you.

659
00:46:15,121 --> 00:46:19,114
Then I came down to L.A.
And got a job in a dime-a-dance joint.

660
00:46:20,326 --> 00:46:21,987
It was a living...

661
00:46:23,729 --> 00:46:25,993
but I got pretty sick of being pawed over.

662
00:46:26,065 --> 00:46:29,364
So when Babe came along,
I crashed out again.

663
00:46:31,404 --> 00:46:33,804
I thought Babe was the right guy.

664
00:46:34,774 --> 00:46:38,437
I guess I was never really hooked up
with any guys that wasn't wrong.

665
00:46:38,511 --> 00:46:41,036
So I had nothing to go by...

666
00:46:42,782 --> 00:46:44,306
till I met you.

667
00:46:57,763 --> 00:46:59,287
I'll get ready.

668
00:47:32,264 --> 00:47:34,232
Go away, Pard, will you?

669
00:47:42,408 --> 00:47:43,966
What's the matter?

670
00:47:44,043 --> 00:47:48,036
Roy, please don't send me back to L.A.
Please don't.

671
00:47:48,447 --> 00:47:51,348
I want to stay with you. Please, Roy, don't.

672
00:47:59,358 --> 00:48:00,825
Listen to me.

673
00:48:01,694 --> 00:48:03,924
I'm giving it to you straight.

674
00:48:04,363 --> 00:48:08,026
I got plans, see?
And there's no room in them for you.

675
00:48:09,135 --> 00:48:13,094
You couldn't never mean nothing to me.
Nothing special, that is.

676
00:48:14,373 --> 00:48:16,170
You know what I mean?

677
00:48:26,018 --> 00:48:29,476
I'm gonna take a run down to L.A.
I can't stand this waiting around.

678
00:48:29,555 --> 00:48:33,616
Let me go along, Roy, will you?
I sure would like to take in a movie.

679
00:48:33,692 --> 00:48:36,024
All right. Get your things
and bring my hat.

680
00:48:36,095 --> 00:48:37,289
Okay. I won't be a second.

681
00:48:37,363 --> 00:48:41,766
We'll be back in plenty of time
in case Mendoza calls, if he ever calls.

682
00:48:42,034 --> 00:48:45,993
I don't like the way he's stalling around.
I just don't like it.

683
00:48:48,574 --> 00:48:51,771
- You guys keep your noses clean.
- Yeah, sure, Roy.

684
00:49:07,059 --> 00:49:09,050
Roy, Pard's following us.

685
00:49:09,228 --> 00:49:12,391
- Go on home, Pard. Go back.
- Roy, let's take him along with us.

686
00:49:12,464 --> 00:49:15,058
I gotta leave him sometime.
He has to get used to it.

687
00:49:15,134 --> 00:49:18,729
Yeah, you gotta leave him sometime,
so let's take him now.

688
00:49:20,606 --> 00:49:21,937
All right.

689
00:49:23,142 --> 00:49:24,473
Here, boy.

690
00:49:28,113 --> 00:49:30,308
You gonna take in a movie
when we get to L.A.?

691
00:49:30,382 --> 00:49:33,078
I don't care, I just came for the ride.

692
00:49:33,786 --> 00:49:37,187
I guess I'd better take care of Pard, then,
if you're going to a movie.

693
00:49:37,256 --> 00:49:38,587
Where you going?

694
00:49:38,657 --> 00:49:42,354
- To see some people, friends of mine.
- What's their racket?

695
00:49:43,529 --> 00:49:45,554
They're not in any racket.

696
00:49:45,764 --> 00:49:48,460
He's a farmer from Ohio, lost his farm.

697
00:49:48,667 --> 00:49:51,761
There's him and Ma
and his granddaughter.

698
00:49:53,172 --> 00:49:54,639
Granddaughter?

699
00:49:55,074 --> 00:49:57,406
Yeah. Her name's Velma.

700
00:49:58,010 --> 00:50:02,276
Just had an operation on her foot.
Mighty pretty girl.

701
00:50:04,016 --> 00:50:05,210
Is she?

702
00:50:07,953 --> 00:50:09,580
Yeah, and decent.

703
00:50:27,706 --> 00:50:29,799
- Hello, Pa.
- Hello, Roy.

704
00:50:29,875 --> 00:50:32,002
I'll be doggoned. Where you been?

705
00:50:32,077 --> 00:50:33,977
- How's Velma?
- You wouldn't know her.

706
00:50:34,046 --> 00:50:36,446
- Is she walking around?
- She's still in bed.

707
00:50:36,515 --> 00:50:39,643
But the doctor says in a few days
she can dance or do anything...

708
00:50:39,718 --> 00:50:41,652
and nobody would ever know
she was crippled.

709
00:50:41,720 --> 00:50:42,914
Say, that's great.

710
00:50:42,988 --> 00:50:45,616
Hello, boy. There's a cute little fellow.

711
00:50:45,691 --> 00:50:48,091
Roy, it's about time.

712
00:50:48,160 --> 00:50:49,787
Ma, cut that out.

713
00:50:50,329 --> 00:50:52,854
Roy's a darn nice-looking fellow
and I'm jealous.

714
00:50:52,932 --> 00:50:55,833
Come on in and see Velma.
She'll be glad to see you.

715
00:50:55,901 --> 00:50:57,766
Roy, you look so good.

716
00:50:57,970 --> 00:51:01,804
Mabel's husband is at work,
and Mabel's uptown, gadding around...

717
00:51:01,874 --> 00:51:04,570
so you got her all to yourself today, Roy.

718
00:51:04,643 --> 00:51:06,577
I hear you're all right.

719
00:51:07,379 --> 00:51:09,847
- She wants to kiss you.
- Ma.

720
00:51:13,986 --> 00:51:16,420
We were wondering
what happened to you, Roy.

721
00:51:16,488 --> 00:51:18,353
I've been pretty busy.

722
00:51:18,624 --> 00:51:20,785
Did it hurt much
when they fixed your foot?

723
00:51:20,859 --> 00:51:23,828
It didn't hurt at all. I didn't even know it.

724
00:51:27,633 --> 00:51:31,467
We'll never get through thanking you.
It was wonderful of you.

725
00:51:32,404 --> 00:51:36,340
Say, I got a big business deal coming up...

726
00:51:36,742 --> 00:51:40,769
and if it goes through the way
I think it ought to, I can quit for life.

727
00:51:40,846 --> 00:51:43,280
That's fine, Roy. Did you tell Pa?

728
00:51:43,349 --> 00:51:47,308
I was thinking that if this deal
goes through the way it ought to...

729
00:51:47,386 --> 00:51:51,117
I'd like to take a trip around the world.
And I was just...

730
00:51:52,825 --> 00:51:54,918
You see what I mean, Velma?

731
00:51:56,295 --> 00:51:57,660
Yes, I see.

732
00:51:59,365 --> 00:52:03,199
I was thinking if you didn't want
to a take a trip around the world...

733
00:52:03,268 --> 00:52:05,293
what would you like to do?

734
00:52:05,604 --> 00:52:08,767
You see, Velma, I'd sure like to marry you.

735
00:52:10,909 --> 00:52:14,538
I ain't so old and I'm gonna have
plenty of dough someday.

736
00:52:16,315 --> 00:52:19,751
Gee, I don't know.
You sure been wonderful to us, Roy.

737
00:52:20,319 --> 00:52:23,152
And Pa says
there's no better man than you.

738
00:52:23,922 --> 00:52:27,289
- But, Roy...
- You got somebody back home, I guess.

739
00:52:29,495 --> 00:52:31,861
Yes, in a way I have.

740
00:52:31,930 --> 00:52:34,922
He's figuring on coming out here
to marry you?

741
00:52:35,234 --> 00:52:37,896
I don't know. I may go back there.

742
00:52:38,003 --> 00:52:40,437
I ought to be hearing from him
any day now.

743
00:52:40,506 --> 00:52:42,804
Are you crazy about him, Velma?

744
00:52:47,913 --> 00:52:49,778
I guess that lets me out.

745
00:52:49,848 --> 00:52:53,147
But we can still be friends, though,
can't we, Roy?

746
00:52:54,319 --> 00:52:56,412
When will we see you again?

747
00:52:59,425 --> 00:53:00,892
I don't know.

748
00:53:03,362 --> 00:53:05,262
But I'll be walking in a few days.

749
00:53:05,330 --> 00:53:07,958
You simply must come back
to see me walk.

750
00:53:08,033 --> 00:53:09,694
Of course he will.

751
00:53:14,039 --> 00:53:16,473
I'll come back and see Velma walk.

752
00:53:25,184 --> 00:53:26,811
What's wrong, pet?

753
00:53:27,152 --> 00:53:29,450
He wants me to marry him, Pa...

754
00:53:30,022 --> 00:53:32,752
and I said I wouldn't on account of Lon.

755
00:53:35,194 --> 00:53:39,631
I don't love Roy, Pa.
I'm not crippled anymore, Pa.

756
00:53:39,998 --> 00:53:42,364
And from now on I'm gonna have fun...

757
00:53:42,434 --> 00:53:45,232
dressing up and going places and dancing.

758
00:53:45,471 --> 00:53:48,167
I'll dance all night long if I want to!

759
00:53:52,311 --> 00:53:54,609
I know what Roy did for me, Pa.

760
00:53:56,715 --> 00:53:58,512
But I don't love him.

761
00:53:59,718 --> 00:54:01,652
I just don't love him!

762
00:54:02,187 --> 00:54:03,654
There, there.

763
00:54:13,799 --> 00:54:16,927
Good morning. A man phoned in
a telegram for Mr. Collins.

764
00:54:17,002 --> 00:54:19,527
Hello, Pard. You hard-luck dog, you.

765
00:54:26,512 --> 00:54:28,537
It's from Mendoza. Tonight's the night.

766
00:54:30,182 --> 00:54:33,515
Here are the three hammers.
Shall I take the sledge, Roy?

767
00:54:33,585 --> 00:54:36,577
I don't know. I never cracked
a safety deposit box before.

768
00:54:36,655 --> 00:54:39,021
I don't see why
Mendoza can't open those boxes.

769
00:54:39,091 --> 00:54:41,423
It'd be a tip-off that it was an inside job.

770
00:54:41,493 --> 00:54:44,485
The cops would pinch him and he'd sing,
or I don't know guys.

771
00:54:44,563 --> 00:54:46,394
Roy, what about Pard?

772
00:54:49,168 --> 00:54:52,626
Take him over to Algernon
and tell him to lock him up. Here's $5.

773
00:54:52,704 --> 00:54:56,299
- Why not take him along?
- Taking a dog on a caper, that's rich.

774
00:54:56,375 --> 00:54:58,070
I'd watch after him.

775
00:54:58,143 --> 00:54:59,940
You do as I tell you.

776
00:55:09,721 --> 00:55:11,621
I guess that's everything.

777
00:55:11,690 --> 00:55:14,921
Now, listen. When we get into the hotel,
don't anybody look up.

778
00:55:14,993 --> 00:55:17,427
No matter what happens.
That's my business.

779
00:55:17,496 --> 00:55:19,964
Nobody's gonna bother you,
and I mean nobody.

780
00:55:20,032 --> 00:55:22,000
Are there any questions?

781
00:55:22,234 --> 00:55:25,101
Marie and I will head to L.A.
With the jewelry in a shoebox.

782
00:55:25,170 --> 00:55:26,637
You take the dough and come here.

783
00:55:26,705 --> 00:55:30,266
When you hear from us,
bring the dough to L.A. All right?

784
00:55:31,944 --> 00:55:33,502
I guess we're all set.

785
00:55:33,579 --> 00:55:36,878
I'm glad Marie's going.
She's got more nerve than most guys.

786
00:55:37,516 --> 00:55:41,043
And we'll make up her share between us.
That's fair, ain't it?

787
00:55:41,453 --> 00:55:45,355
You bet. It's worth it to have someone
to watch out for the car.

788
00:55:49,661 --> 00:55:52,221
I'll never forget a guy I knew
called Petty Garrison.

789
00:55:52,297 --> 00:55:55,733
One day him and another creep
waltzes in to knock over a grocery store.

790
00:55:55,801 --> 00:55:57,792
They left the heap outside
with the engine on.

791
00:55:57,869 --> 00:56:01,327
They come out ahead of a shotgun blast.
Somebody snitched it.

792
00:56:01,406 --> 00:56:05,308
So they ducks down an alley
and runs right smack into a copper.

793
00:56:05,477 --> 00:56:09,277
- Brother, what a mess.
- You think of the prettiest stories to tell.

794
00:56:09,348 --> 00:56:12,784
- They was just small-timers, not like us.
- We wasn't big till this one.

795
00:56:12,851 --> 00:56:15,615
- I don't feel big.
- Roy feels big. That's what counts.

796
00:56:15,687 --> 00:56:17,245
Cut the gab and get going.

797
00:56:25,063 --> 00:56:27,531
Pard's locked in.
He knows there's something up...

798
00:56:27,599 --> 00:56:29,226
he keeps scratching at the door.

799
00:56:29,301 --> 00:56:31,769
That little mutt's just a plain nuisance.

800
00:56:45,284 --> 00:56:49,118
- That's Pard. I told you he knew.
- Shut up and get in the car.

801
00:56:49,955 --> 00:56:53,823
Wish that dog would stop howling.
Gives me the creeps.

802
00:57:11,643 --> 00:57:15,739
- What's wrong with you?
- It's Pard. He got loose. He's following us.

803
00:57:15,881 --> 00:57:19,044
- He can't follow us far at night.
- Roy, you can't.

804
00:57:19,184 --> 00:57:23,382
Who says I can't? What I ought to do
is put a bullet through his head.

805
00:57:23,455 --> 00:57:26,447
Ain't I got enough trouble
without a fool dog?

806
00:57:31,096 --> 00:57:32,461
Let him in.

807
00:57:36,068 --> 00:57:40,300
Poor little fellow.
Got no home, got nobody, have you?

808
00:57:41,306 --> 00:57:43,171
Of all the 14-karat saps.

809
00:57:43,241 --> 00:57:46,108
Starting out on a caper
with a woman and a dog.

810
00:57:46,178 --> 00:57:49,443
- Lf he spoils this job, I'll...
- You're full of talk.

811
00:57:49,514 --> 00:57:51,277
I think you're glad.

812
00:58:30,021 --> 00:58:32,649
Shut up. One move,
and I'll fill your pants with lead.

813
00:58:32,724 --> 00:58:34,419
- Get over there.
- I will, sir.

814
00:58:34,493 --> 00:58:36,154
Open it up, quick.

815
00:58:51,810 --> 00:58:55,371
- How's it going?
- Having a little trouble with the boxes.

816
00:59:14,766 --> 00:59:16,256
How you doing?

817
00:59:16,835 --> 00:59:20,396
Got a few more. This is really something.

818
00:59:51,336 --> 00:59:55,363
- Quiet, peaceful little hotel.
- Nice time of night to build a house.

819
00:59:56,641 --> 01:00:00,202
Get over there. Shut up. Go on, move.
Over there. Move fast.

820
01:00:00,278 --> 01:00:02,371
Bob, my rings. You've got to stop them.

821
01:00:02,447 --> 01:00:04,608
Look, my friend, you can't do this. I mean...

822
01:00:04,683 --> 01:00:05,945
Sit down.

823
01:00:06,685 --> 01:00:09,085
You won't get hurt. Hey, you.

824
01:00:11,022 --> 01:00:13,582
- Yes, sir?
- Sit over there.

825
01:00:15,460 --> 01:00:17,553
- Go on, hurry up.
- Yes, sir.

826
01:00:59,404 --> 01:01:01,065
Heist them, buddy.

827
01:01:22,561 --> 01:01:26,292
Take me with you. I couldn't face the cops.
I didn't think we'd have to shoot.

828
01:01:26,364 --> 01:01:29,629
He won't croak, I shot low.
Go on, get in that car.

829
01:01:30,168 --> 01:01:31,635
Police!

830
01:02:02,434 --> 01:02:04,527
He's taking the wrong road.

831
01:02:22,287 --> 01:02:26,155
- The coppers will go to the fire now.
- Roy, those boys.

832
01:02:27,492 --> 01:02:29,619
Small-timers for small jobs.

833
01:02:30,629 --> 01:02:34,998
They lost their heads.
This one was just too big.

834
01:02:46,111 --> 01:02:49,171
- You feeling better now?
- Still kind of wobbly.

835
01:02:49,948 --> 01:02:53,816
- I keep thinking of Babe and Red.
- There's no use of worrying about them.

836
01:02:53,885 --> 01:02:56,877
If they didn't kick off,
the coppers have them.

837
01:02:56,955 --> 01:02:58,513
Do you think they'll talk?

838
01:02:58,590 --> 01:03:00,820
If they don't, Mendoza will.
But who cares?

839
01:03:00,892 --> 01:03:03,417
I'll be giving that box to Big Mac
in a couple of hours.

840
01:03:03,495 --> 01:03:05,429
He's gonna hand me a wad of dough.

841
01:03:05,497 --> 01:03:08,227
Gee. Then we'll be all set, won't we, Roy?

842
01:03:08,299 --> 01:03:11,063
Sure. You got quite a piece of change
coming to you, too.

843
01:03:11,136 --> 01:03:13,604
And I'm gonna see
that you get it right away.

844
01:03:13,672 --> 01:03:17,472
'Cause I'll be blowing pretty soon.
Going back East, I guess.

845
01:03:17,542 --> 01:03:20,443
- I'm going with you.
- Don't talk like a sap.

846
01:03:20,645 --> 01:03:23,808
If you stick with me,
you'll never be in anything but trouble.

847
01:03:23,882 --> 01:03:27,750
Look, Roy, no matter what happens,
I'm sticking with you.

848
01:03:28,586 --> 01:03:31,612
Don't think you're ever gonna
check me so easy.

849
01:03:32,824 --> 01:03:35,725
We'll see. Come on, let's go.
Come on, Pard.

850
01:03:36,327 --> 01:03:37,419
But remember...

851
01:03:37,495 --> 01:03:40,794
if the going gets too tough,
I'm gonna have to park you for a while.

852
01:03:40,865 --> 01:03:44,301
I'm glad you said "for a while."
That makes me feel good.

853
01:03:45,270 --> 01:03:48,205
If I really get in your way,
you can park me.

854
01:03:48,339 --> 01:03:49,863
Is that a deal?

855
01:03:51,142 --> 01:03:52,541
It's a deal.

856
01:04:04,255 --> 01:04:05,847
I won't be long.

857
01:04:22,841 --> 01:04:25,309
- Hello, Earle.
- What are you doing here?

858
01:04:25,810 --> 01:04:28,074
Mac sent for me.
I flew out a couple of days ago.

859
01:04:28,146 --> 01:04:32,207
Mighty sick man, Mac is.
He collapsed last night. He's asleep now.

860
01:04:33,284 --> 01:04:35,411
Want to read about yourself?

861
01:04:36,387 --> 01:04:38,378
Tough about the two guys.

862
01:04:38,523 --> 01:04:41,583
- It was their own fault.
- Their troubles are over.

863
01:04:41,659 --> 01:04:42,751
Both of them.

864
01:04:42,827 --> 01:04:46,285
Mendoza broke his collarbone.
He got knocked cold, but he'll be okay.

865
01:04:46,364 --> 01:04:49,561
Police think he was kidnapped.
They haven't identified Babe and Red.

866
01:04:49,634 --> 01:04:52,398
Let's show the stuff to Mac.
It might cheer him up.

867
01:04:52,470 --> 01:04:55,633
- You got it in that shoebox there?
- Yeah, and it sure is heavy.

868
01:04:55,707 --> 01:04:58,699
Boss, wake up. Earle's here.
He clipped them for $500,000.

869
01:04:58,777 --> 01:05:01,837
I sure come through for you.
You didn't spring me for nothing.

870
01:05:01,913 --> 01:05:04,006
Wake up, Mac. Earle's here.

871
01:05:08,386 --> 01:05:10,013
This guy is dead.

872
01:05:17,562 --> 01:05:19,427
- He's what?
- He's dead.

873
01:05:21,733 --> 01:05:25,829
Yep, cold as a mackerel.
Kicked off in his sleep, I guess.

874
01:05:30,675 --> 01:05:32,643
What are you gonna do with the stuff?

875
01:05:32,710 --> 01:05:35,577
Mac told me what to do
in case something like this happened.

876
01:05:35,647 --> 01:05:37,376
I guess he knew he'd never make it.

877
01:05:37,448 --> 01:05:39,678
Don't be a sap. Mac's dead, and we're rich.

878
01:05:39,751 --> 01:05:43,278
I can get a fence to handle this stuff.
Don't you see it? We're rich.

879
01:05:43,354 --> 01:05:46,517
Listen, chiseler, I'm still working for him,
and so are you.

880
01:05:46,591 --> 01:05:48,582
I got my instructions and I'll follow them.

881
01:05:48,660 --> 01:05:51,925
Use your head, man.
This is a chance of a lifetime.

882
01:05:52,363 --> 01:05:55,730
- You heard me.
- Okay, maybe you're right.

883
01:06:15,186 --> 01:06:16,619
Pico, 7719.

884
01:06:18,957 --> 01:06:23,018
Hello. This you, Art?
This is Earle. Mac's dead.

885
01:06:24,329 --> 01:06:28,322
Yeah. He said in the letter to call you.
That you was to do the handling.

886
01:06:28,399 --> 01:06:32,028
Nope. He just kicked off.

887
01:06:32,837 --> 01:06:33,997
His heart.

888
01:06:35,607 --> 01:06:37,006
Okay. Thanks.

889
01:06:40,378 --> 01:06:42,403
Hand over that box, Earle.

890
01:06:45,049 --> 01:06:48,075
You give me any trouble
and I'll fill you full of lead.

891
01:06:48,152 --> 01:06:50,985
I'd be reinstated and get a medal besides.

892
01:06:52,156 --> 01:06:56,354
Just what I told poor Mac.
A copper's always a copper.

893
01:06:59,731 --> 01:07:01,756
This stuff's pretty hot, anyway.

894
01:07:02,567 --> 01:07:03,693
Here it is.

895
01:07:24,355 --> 01:07:26,550
What happened?
I was going to look for you.

896
01:07:26,624 --> 01:07:28,956
- Get in the car. You gotta drive.
- What's wrong?

897
01:07:29,027 --> 01:07:30,358
Bullet nicked me.

898
01:07:34,198 --> 01:07:36,098
Go to Vermont and turn right.

899
01:07:39,470 --> 01:07:41,062
You're mighty lucky, Roy.

900
01:07:41,139 --> 01:07:44,506
A little higher,
it would have been curtains for you.

901
01:07:45,677 --> 01:07:47,508
That stuff sure burns, Doc.

902
01:07:47,578 --> 01:07:50,809
Tell me, Roy,
did you really crack them for $500,000?

903
01:07:51,215 --> 01:07:52,273
We can't tell yet.

904
01:07:52,350 --> 01:07:56,514
They always kick up the price
after a heist, but I got plenty of rocks.

905
01:07:56,587 --> 01:07:58,646
You'll have to trust me
on the dough angle.

906
01:07:58,723 --> 01:08:02,056
- I only got about $50 or $60 on me.
- You didn't get your cut yet?

907
01:08:02,126 --> 01:08:04,993
That's all right, but I figure
this will cost you about $500.

908
01:08:05,063 --> 01:08:07,930
- I'm taking an awful chance.
- $500's okay with me.

909
01:08:08,333 --> 01:08:11,530
When I need help, I need it bad,
and I'm willing to pay for it.

910
01:08:11,602 --> 01:08:14,002
- What about little Velma?
- I don't know, Doc.

911
01:08:14,072 --> 01:08:18,532
That was just one of them things, I guess.
Is she walking pretty good now?

912
01:08:18,609 --> 01:08:21,806
Perfectly. That surgeon friend of mine
did a magnificent job.

913
01:08:21,879 --> 01:08:24,074
You ought to see her.
It'd do your heart good.

914
01:08:24,148 --> 01:08:27,413
Maybe I will look in for a minute.
I promised the old man I would.

915
01:08:27,485 --> 01:08:29,146
You'd better be going now.

916
01:08:29,220 --> 01:08:31,120
Make a right turn here.

917
01:08:31,489 --> 01:08:34,822
What about getting rid of the stuff?
Aren't we going to Santa Monica?

918
01:08:34,892 --> 01:08:37,827
There's something I gotta do first.
It'll only take a minute.

919
01:08:37,895 --> 01:08:39,055
Velma?

920
01:08:41,632 --> 01:08:44,567
I promised Pa I'd come back
and see her walk.

921
01:08:45,136 --> 01:08:47,297
Fine time you picked to go calling.

922
01:08:50,174 --> 01:08:53,200
- Can I go in with you?
- You'll stay in the car.

923
01:08:53,478 --> 01:08:56,606
I'm only going in myself
because I promised the old man.

924
01:08:56,748 --> 01:08:58,943
Yeah, I know. You said that.

925
01:09:12,597 --> 01:09:16,533
My foot gets stronger all the time, Lon.
Don't you think I'm dancing better?

926
01:09:16,601 --> 01:09:19,069
Sure, baby. You're perfect.
How about a little drink?

927
01:09:19,137 --> 01:09:22,231
No, Lon. You want me to get dizzy again
like last night?

928
01:09:22,306 --> 01:09:23,864
Cootchie, cootchie!

929
01:09:23,941 --> 01:09:27,843
- Do you think they'll be all right?
- Sure. Joe's a panic when he's tight.

930
01:09:27,912 --> 01:09:31,075
You said it, boy. Listen, I was...

931
01:09:31,149 --> 01:09:34,949
Now, look here.
I never was one to spoil a good time...

932
01:09:35,019 --> 01:09:37,749
but enough's enough. That's what I say...

933
01:09:38,956 --> 01:09:40,389
Who's that now?

934
01:09:44,996 --> 01:09:46,623
- Roy.
- Hello, Pa.

935
01:09:46,697 --> 01:09:48,688
Well, this is a surprise!

936
01:09:50,935 --> 01:09:54,769
Hello, Roy! Well, it's about time
you dropped in. Where have you been?

937
01:09:55,173 --> 01:09:58,700
The rest of the family's out for a ride.
They'll be sorry they missed you.

938
01:09:58,776 --> 01:10:01,006
Roy, this is Mr. Preiser. He's my...

939
01:10:01,612 --> 01:10:02,670
He's from back home.

940
01:10:02,747 --> 01:10:05,215
Hello. Velma's told me a lot about you.

941
01:10:05,283 --> 01:10:07,547
We had a couple of drinks to you
the other night.

942
01:10:07,618 --> 01:10:09,108
- Did you?
- Yeah.

943
01:10:09,687 --> 01:10:13,418
You haven't seen me dance yet.
My foot's all better now. Watch me.

944
01:10:16,461 --> 01:10:19,362
Go on, Pard. Go get Roy. Go find him.

945
01:10:22,500 --> 01:10:25,367
This is a fine party,
letting a lady dance by herself.

946
01:10:25,436 --> 01:10:26,698
Come on, baby.

947
01:10:30,108 --> 01:10:32,269
I declare, who's that now?

948
01:10:36,581 --> 01:10:38,446
Pard, you bad dog, you!

949
01:10:39,717 --> 01:10:43,414
I'm sorry. He jumped out of the car
before I knew what had happened.

950
01:10:48,192 --> 01:10:50,285
Hello. You're Velma, aren't you?

951
01:10:51,129 --> 01:10:54,189
- That's right.
- I'm Marie Garson, a friend of Roy's.

952
01:10:54,765 --> 01:10:56,596
I feel as though I know you.

953
01:10:57,001 --> 01:10:59,367
Roy has often told me how nice you are.

954
01:10:59,971 --> 01:11:01,165
Has he?

955
01:11:01,239 --> 01:11:04,697
Say, that reminds me,
you did a lot for Velma, Roy.

956
01:11:05,109 --> 01:11:07,737
I gotta pay you back.
After all, it's a lot of money.

957
01:11:07,812 --> 01:11:11,805
- Forget it. Think nothing of it.
- But I'd like you to take it, Roy.

958
01:11:11,883 --> 01:11:16,183
After all, Lon and I will be married soon,
and he can afford it easily.

959
01:11:16,787 --> 01:11:18,152
Getting married?

960
01:11:20,224 --> 01:11:21,623
Well, that's fine.

961
01:11:24,162 --> 01:11:25,595
Yeah, that's swell.

962
01:11:26,597 --> 01:11:29,498
Well, I guess I'll be on my way, Pa.

963
01:11:29,567 --> 01:11:33,162
I'm going back East.
I just came in to say goodbye.

964
01:11:33,404 --> 01:11:35,872
Well, let's have a drink together first.

965
01:11:35,940 --> 01:11:39,376
You and your little girlie,
and me and my little Velma.

966
01:11:39,644 --> 01:11:41,305
Get your hands off me.

967
01:11:42,713 --> 01:11:44,772
- I'm sorry.
- I don't like you.

968
01:11:45,716 --> 01:11:48,685
I don't like the way you talk
and I don't like your friends.

969
01:11:48,753 --> 01:11:51,187
I don't like to think of her
being married to you.

970
01:11:51,255 --> 01:11:52,347
Now, come on, Roy.

971
01:11:52,423 --> 01:11:54,687
You haven't got any right
to say such things!

972
01:11:54,759 --> 01:11:57,353
Lon's gonna be my husband
and I love him.

973
01:11:57,428 --> 01:11:59,896
You're just jealous and mean
'cause I don't want you.

974
01:11:59,964 --> 01:12:01,829
'Cause I never wanted you.

975
01:12:05,102 --> 01:12:06,501
I'm sure sorry.

976
01:12:06,571 --> 01:12:10,132
It's all right. Maybe it's just as well
it happened this way.

977
01:12:11,142 --> 01:12:13,610
- Goodbye, Pa.
- Goodbye.

978
01:12:15,913 --> 01:12:17,437
Some nerve he had.

979
01:12:17,548 --> 01:12:20,915
If it wasn't for you,
I'd have punched him right in the nose.

980
01:12:21,886 --> 01:12:25,049
- You shouldn't have come in there.
- I had to, Roy.

981
01:12:25,957 --> 01:12:28,152
You thought of her more than you did me.

982
01:12:28,226 --> 01:12:30,285
I just wanted to know why.

983
01:12:34,098 --> 01:12:36,293
You don't love her anymore, do you?

984
01:12:37,401 --> 01:12:38,459
No.

985
01:12:39,470 --> 01:12:42,496
If you weren't sure of it,
you wouldn't have asked me.

986
01:12:48,346 --> 01:12:51,645
If I didn't know where they come from,
I'd think they was phony.

987
01:12:51,716 --> 01:12:53,115
Poor old Mac.

988
01:12:54,585 --> 01:12:58,521
There he was, laying there dead,
with $500,000 beside him.

989
01:13:00,791 --> 01:13:03,259
It's all yours, and all I want is my cut.

990
01:13:03,461 --> 01:13:06,396
You're gonna have to wait
a few days for that, Roy.

991
01:13:06,464 --> 01:13:08,193
- What?
- Don't look at me like that.

992
01:13:08,266 --> 01:13:10,291
My share you could put in your eye.

993
01:13:10,368 --> 01:13:12,836
Larry's the head man,
now that Mac's gone.

994
01:13:13,004 --> 01:13:14,665
- Kansas City?
- That's him.

995
01:13:14,739 --> 01:13:16,138
He's flying out.

996
01:13:16,741 --> 01:13:19,972
Now, you leave the stuff with me
and hide out for a while.

997
01:13:20,478 --> 01:13:22,070
I can help you out a little.

998
01:13:22,146 --> 01:13:25,582
Are you trying to pull a fast one on me?
Because I don't like fast ones.

999
01:13:25,650 --> 01:13:28,312
Take the stuff with you
if you feel that way.

1000
01:13:28,386 --> 01:13:31,219
But it'll be like carrying a bomb around.

1001
01:13:32,390 --> 01:13:35,359
Okay. Give me a couple of $100s
and keep this.

1002
01:13:35,793 --> 01:13:38,819
But if I don't get my end,
you ain't gonna be around long.

1003
01:13:38,896 --> 01:13:40,329
You and Larry both.

1004
01:13:40,398 --> 01:13:44,061
Now, don't worry, Roy.
You'll get it. Here's $200.

1005
01:13:48,105 --> 01:13:50,903
Yeah, that's what I want.

1006
01:14:13,631 --> 01:14:15,155
That's a present.

1007
01:14:22,106 --> 01:14:25,166
Of course, you would put it
on the wrong finger.

1008
01:14:53,337 --> 01:14:54,361
Well?

1009
01:14:54,538 --> 01:14:57,098
Same old song. Nothing doing yet.

1010
01:14:57,808 --> 01:15:00,675
I'm gonna run out of dough
with all these long-distance calls.

1011
01:15:00,745 --> 01:15:03,646
You should've taken the money
Velma's boyfriend offered you.

1012
01:15:03,714 --> 01:15:07,081
But, no, "Think nothing of it."
That's what you said. Sucker.

1013
01:15:13,624 --> 01:15:16,855
Yeah. Don't look like this thing's
ever going to cool off.

1014
01:15:18,729 --> 01:15:21,129
Look, I've been thinking things over.

1015
01:15:22,099 --> 01:15:24,659
I like little Pard here as much as you do...

1016
01:15:25,236 --> 01:15:27,898
but remember what Algernon said
about him being bad luck?

1017
01:15:27,972 --> 01:15:31,135
- That's a lot of malarkey.
- Maybe it is, and maybe it isn't.

1018
01:15:31,208 --> 01:15:34,666
How could a poor little dog be the cause
of it all? That's just dumb!

1019
01:15:34,745 --> 01:15:36,235
Sometimes you get me crazy.

1020
01:15:36,313 --> 01:15:38,975
You think nobody knows nothing but you.

1021
01:15:39,083 --> 01:15:42,644
Okay, Pard's to blame for everything.
It's all his fault. Have it your way.

1022
01:15:42,720 --> 01:15:44,984
I only said there might be something to it.

1023
01:15:45,055 --> 01:15:47,580
- Shut up.
- Don't tell me to shut up, you...

1024
01:15:52,897 --> 01:15:54,694
Honey, I'm sorry.

1025
01:15:55,599 --> 01:15:59,865
It's hurting you, isn't it? You just let me
change this dressing for you.

1026
01:16:03,407 --> 01:16:04,738
I'm sorry.

1027
01:16:05,810 --> 01:16:08,836
It don't look so good, Roy. It's all red.

1028
01:16:09,647 --> 01:16:12,810
- Do you feel as if you have any fever?
- I don't think so.

1029
01:16:13,717 --> 01:16:16,948
I don't know, maybe I have.
Think I ought to go in and see the Doc?

1030
01:16:17,021 --> 01:16:19,615
No, you can't do that. They might get you.

1031
01:16:20,191 --> 01:16:24,127
You can't trust anybody, Roy.
After all, $10,000 is a lot of money.

1032
01:16:25,830 --> 01:16:29,197
You ought to turn me in
and live easy for the rest of your life.

1033
01:16:30,034 --> 01:16:33,231
Even in fun, don't ever say things like that.

1034
01:16:48,118 --> 01:16:49,608
Thanks, sonny.

1035
01:17:02,199 --> 01:17:04,759
- Morning.
- Morning, Mr. Collins.

1036
01:17:19,149 --> 01:17:22,346
Baby, our troubles are over.
I'm driving in tonight.

1037
01:17:22,419 --> 01:17:24,717
I called Art
and he said they'll have my cut ready.

1038
01:17:24,788 --> 01:17:26,278
- How's that?
- That's great.

1039
01:17:26,357 --> 01:17:28,325
Now we can go back East
where we'll be safe.

1040
01:17:28,392 --> 01:17:30,553
I thought they were giving me
the old runaround.

1041
01:17:30,628 --> 01:17:33,825
- It sure is easy to be wrong in this world.
- Honey, love me?

1042
01:17:33,898 --> 01:17:35,195
You bet I do.

1043
01:17:38,235 --> 01:17:40,135
- Let him out, will you?
- Okay.

1044
01:17:47,845 --> 01:17:50,040
- Pains?
- Yeah, a little.

1045
01:17:50,481 --> 01:17:52,073
Look, honey, I'll drive in.

1046
01:17:52,149 --> 01:17:54,515
Nothing doing. Suppose we get a rumble?

1047
01:17:54,585 --> 01:17:56,519
They're not even looking for you yet.

1048
01:17:56,587 --> 01:17:58,851
Still, I'll drive.
You go ahead with the packing.

1049
01:17:58,923 --> 01:18:01,289
- I think the car needs gas.
- All right.

1050
01:18:06,363 --> 01:18:09,264
Nice little Pard.
Nice little boy. Shake hands?

1051
01:18:09,833 --> 01:18:13,792
Nice Pard. He's a fine boy. Nice little Pard.

1052
01:18:18,509 --> 01:18:19,806
I want to see you.

1053
01:18:19,877 --> 01:18:23,813
I'm busy. I got a lot to do this morning.

1054
01:18:24,181 --> 01:18:27,776
That's a nice little dog you got there.
I was trying to make up with him.

1055
01:18:27,851 --> 01:18:30,115
What makes you think his name's Pard?

1056
01:18:30,354 --> 01:18:33,619
Didn't I hear you call him that yesterday?
Maybe I'm wrong.

1057
01:18:38,629 --> 01:18:39,687
Get in.

1058
01:18:46,737 --> 01:18:48,329
You know who I am, don't you?

1059
01:18:48,405 --> 01:18:50,703
No. I never saw you
before you came here. Honest.

1060
01:18:50,774 --> 01:18:54,107
- What are you so scared about, then?
- Please don't kill me.

1061
01:18:54,178 --> 01:18:55,509
Open that door.

1062
01:18:57,681 --> 01:18:59,376
Looking for that reward?

1063
01:19:09,393 --> 01:19:10,883
Listen to this:

1064
01:19:11,595 --> 01:19:13,620
"Police are hot on his trail.

1065
01:19:13,697 --> 01:19:16,165
"He's traveling with a woman
called Marie...

1066
01:19:16,233 --> 01:19:19,464
"and a little white mongrel dog
who answers to the name of Pard."

1067
01:19:19,536 --> 01:19:21,436
- Mendoza.
- Yeah. He squawked.

1068
01:19:21,505 --> 01:19:25,100
I should've taken care of him
when he followed me out of the hotel.

1069
01:19:25,175 --> 01:19:27,973
Look at the tag they hung on me,
"Mad Dog" Earle.

1070
01:19:28,712 --> 01:19:30,407
Them newspaper rats!

1071
01:19:30,748 --> 01:19:32,773
What are we gonna do, Roy?

1072
01:19:33,117 --> 01:19:34,379
Wait a minute.

1073
01:19:35,853 --> 01:19:39,220
- I gotta park you for a while like you said.
- Like who said?

1074
01:19:39,289 --> 01:19:41,883
We agreed that if the going got tough,
I was to park you.

1075
01:19:41,959 --> 01:19:43,153
You said it was a deal.

1076
01:19:43,227 --> 01:19:46,890
Now look, Roy, I can't leave you now.
I don't care what happens to me.

1077
01:19:46,964 --> 01:19:49,831
Let's stick together.
Let the money go. Forget about it.

1078
01:19:49,900 --> 01:19:52,027
We'll head East. Then we'll be safe.

1079
01:19:52,102 --> 01:19:54,400
Baby, you need dough to get back East.

1080
01:19:54,471 --> 01:19:58,271
I've got maybe $30,000 coming to me
and I'm gonna get it. Now, listen.

1081
01:19:59,076 --> 01:20:00,338
I got an idea.

1082
01:20:01,311 --> 01:20:03,871
I'll put you on the bus to Las Vegas.
Wait there for me.

1083
01:20:03,947 --> 01:20:05,881
I'll get my end, then I'll come after you.

1084
01:20:05,949 --> 01:20:08,645
Roy, please don't leave me.
I'm scared about it.

1085
01:20:09,486 --> 01:20:11,716
You think I want to take you in
and get you shot?

1086
01:20:11,789 --> 01:20:13,848
When they hang that
number-one tag on you...

1087
01:20:13,924 --> 01:20:16,722
they shoot first and argue afterwards.
I know.

1088
01:20:17,394 --> 01:20:20,124
"Mad Dog" Earle. How do you like that?

1089
01:20:21,899 --> 01:20:23,958
They've tied me up
with that Kranmer killing.

1090
01:20:24,034 --> 01:20:25,934
If they get me, I haven't got a chance.

1091
01:20:26,003 --> 01:20:30,235
But they ain't gonna get me.
I've done all the time I'm ever gonna do.

1092
01:20:32,376 --> 01:20:33,900
I'll tie that guy up.

1093
01:20:34,344 --> 01:20:36,312
Now, listen. You go on down to the store...

1094
01:20:36,380 --> 01:20:39,872
and get a big basket with a lid.
Put Pard in it and take him with you.

1095
01:20:39,950 --> 01:20:42,475
Okay, Roy, I'll do anything you say.

1096
01:21:00,738 --> 01:21:03,138
Come on, Pard. Get in here. Come on.

1097
01:21:04,274 --> 01:21:05,263
Get in.

1098
01:21:05,909 --> 01:21:08,343
When you get to Las Vegas,
go to the place I told you.

1099
01:21:08,412 --> 01:21:09,936
Don't ask nobody no questions.

1100
01:21:10,013 --> 01:21:13,278
I'll be with you tomorrow night
at the latest. Got that?

1101
01:21:13,784 --> 01:21:18,016
I just got a feeling about it, Roy.
I'm awful sorry for the way I've acted.

1102
01:21:18,589 --> 01:21:21,319
- You got nothing to be sorry about.
- Yes, I have.

1103
01:21:21,391 --> 01:21:23,951
Nagging at you and flying off the handle.

1104
01:21:24,561 --> 01:21:25,858
I wish I hadn't.

1105
01:21:27,664 --> 01:21:30,656
I like it. I mean, that's the way
married people ought to act.

1106
01:21:30,734 --> 01:21:34,465
My ma and pa fought like cats and dogs,
going on 40 years.

1107
01:21:34,538 --> 01:21:37,769
I wouldn't give you two cents
for a dame without a temper.

1108
01:21:43,981 --> 01:21:45,414
Here she comes.

1109
01:21:46,650 --> 01:21:48,242
Here. Take this.

1110
01:21:48,552 --> 01:21:51,020
That's all you got, Roy.
I don't need that much.

1111
01:21:51,088 --> 01:21:54,023
That's all right, you keep it. I'm all right.

1112
01:21:56,360 --> 01:21:58,590
You're all I got in the world.

1113
01:22:01,431 --> 01:22:03,092
Come on now, baby.

1114
01:22:06,670 --> 01:22:08,501
I'll see you tomorrow night.

1115
01:22:49,947 --> 01:22:53,576
<i>Turning from the European news,</i>
<i>a bulletin just handed me states...</i>

1116
01:22:53,650 --> 01:22:56,380
<i>"Mad Dog"Roy Earle</i>
<i>has been identified as the man...</i>

1117
01:22:56,453 --> 01:23:00,321
<i>who slugged a tourist camp proprietor</i>
<i>this morning at Palmville on route 395.</i>

1118
01:23:00,390 --> 01:23:03,621
<i>Subject of one of the most intensive</i>
<i>searches in California history...</i>

1119
01:23:03,694 --> 01:23:05,924
<i>the bandit killer</i>
<i>and his companion, Marie...</i>

1120
01:23:05,996 --> 01:23:08,021
<i>are believed to be headed</i>
<i>toward Los Angeles.</i>

1121
01:23:38,428 --> 01:23:41,659
- Can I help you, sir?
- Yeah. Give me a pack of cigarettes.

1122
01:23:42,532 --> 01:23:45,626
Don't give me trouble, I won't hurt you.
Hand over your dough.

1123
01:23:45,702 --> 01:23:49,604
Yes, sir. Don't get nervous now.
I'll never get myself shot up over money.

1124
01:23:49,673 --> 01:23:51,504
You're right. You got sense.

1125
01:23:51,642 --> 01:23:55,009
- John, give me a Coke.
- Look out, Tom, it's Roy Earle!

1126
01:24:17,734 --> 01:24:19,565
- What is all this?
- Holdup, Henry.

1127
01:24:19,636 --> 01:24:21,001
John thought it was Roy Earle.

1128
01:24:21,071 --> 01:24:23,039
Been reading too many
detective magazines.

1129
01:24:23,106 --> 01:24:24,664
Sure looked like Earle's picture.

1130
01:24:24,741 --> 01:24:27,301
If it's him, he's headed back over the pass.

1131
01:24:27,511 --> 01:24:29,206
Operator, give me 420.

1132
01:24:31,848 --> 01:24:35,215
Sheriff, Holden speaking. Paramount
Drug Store has just been held up...

1133
01:24:35,285 --> 01:24:37,879
and robbed by a man identified
as Roy Earle.

1134
01:24:37,955 --> 01:24:39,650
<i>Yeah, looks just like him.</i>

1135
01:24:54,104 --> 01:24:57,130
Okay. Patrol car 41
waiting on Highbridge Road.

1136
01:24:57,207 --> 01:24:59,937
Good. We'll have him bottled up
in another hour.

1137
01:29:35,085 --> 01:29:38,316
All right, boys, scatter
and watch yourselves. He's armed.

1138
01:30:15,959 --> 01:30:17,051
We better keep under cover.

1139
01:30:17,127 --> 01:30:19,527
Charley, Spike,
see if you can work over to his left.

1140
01:30:19,596 --> 01:30:21,894
- Lf he moves, let him have it.
- He'll never survive.

1141
01:30:21,965 --> 01:30:23,660
We've trapped him. I know this country.

1142
01:30:23,733 --> 01:30:26,258
Hank and Sam,
go up to the ridge and wait.

1143
01:30:31,041 --> 01:30:33,509
Hey, you! You have no chance!

1144
01:30:33,677 --> 01:30:36,737
Come on down! We won't do no shooting!

1145
01:30:36,913 --> 01:30:40,405
Come and get me, buddy!
What's the matter, you yellow?

1146
01:30:41,618 --> 01:30:44,280
Scout out the Ranger Station
and get Slim up there...

1147
01:30:44,354 --> 01:30:47,255
with his high-powered rifle
and telescope sight.

1148
01:30:50,260 --> 01:30:53,752
<i>He's in command of several hundred feet</i>
<i>between him and the road.</i>

1149
01:30:53,830 --> 01:30:56,594
<i>Natural rock formations shelter him</i>
<i>from attacks above.</i>

1150
01:30:56,666 --> 01:31:00,261
<i>It is some five hours now</i>
<i>since Roy Earle took to cover on the rock...</i>

1151
01:31:00,337 --> 01:31:02,862
<i>and there's no indication</i>
<i>on his part to surrender.</i>

1152
01:31:02,939 --> 01:31:04,873
<i>The road up the mountain</i>
<i>is a jam of traffic.</i>

1153
01:31:04,941 --> 01:31:06,465
<i>Spectators are coming from all over.</i>

1154
01:31:06,543 --> 01:31:09,774
<i>As I said before,</i>
<i>the scene is some 60 miles from Ballard.</i>

1155
01:31:09,879 --> 01:31:12,939
I must go back.
Is there another bus going back soon?

1156
01:31:13,016 --> 01:31:15,484
One leaves from here in about 10 minutes.

1157
01:31:17,087 --> 01:31:20,682
Just like all dames. She don't know
whether she's coming or going.

1158
01:31:22,092 --> 01:31:24,492
It's infernally cold up here.
Maybe it's nerves.

1159
01:31:24,561 --> 01:31:28,395
The rock above, where Earle is hiding,
looks like a huge iceberg.

1160
01:31:28,465 --> 01:31:31,332
Whenever the flares are lit,
the faces of the crowd...

1161
01:31:31,401 --> 01:31:35,269
Iook like white masks of snow.
They look dead, all but their eyes.

1162
01:31:35,338 --> 01:31:38,239
- Where do you think you're going?
- I'm Healy, of the <i>Bulletin</i>.

1163
01:31:38,308 --> 01:31:40,173
Let's see your police card.

1164
01:31:41,244 --> 01:31:42,233
Okay.

1165
01:31:43,079 --> 01:31:46,071
One of the many rumors
is that Earle's about to give himself up.

1166
01:31:46,149 --> 01:31:47,946
<i>Another, that they've sent...</i>

1167
01:31:48,017 --> 01:31:51,077
<i>for a squadron of Army bombing planes</i>
<i>to blast Earle out.</i>

1168
01:31:51,154 --> 01:31:52,416
<i>While all this is going on...</i>

1169
01:31:52,489 --> 01:31:54,616
<i>the Sheriff and his men</i>
<i>are holding conferences.</i>

1170
01:31:54,691 --> 01:31:56,659
<i>The nerves of everyone</i>
<i>are getting more taut.</i>

1171
01:31:56,726 --> 01:31:58,626
<i>In fact, the crowd's getting very restless.</i>

1172
01:31:58,695 --> 01:32:00,856
<i>Huge spotlights are trained</i>
<i>on Earle's fortress.</i>

1173
01:32:00,930 --> 01:32:02,625
<i>Looks like they're doing something new.</i>

1174
01:32:02,699 --> 01:32:04,758
- Howdy, Sheriff.
- Hello, Charlie.

1175
01:32:05,702 --> 01:32:07,363
- Say, Slim?
- Yeah?

1176
01:32:07,437 --> 01:32:09,905
- See that peak up there?
- Yeah.

1177
01:32:09,973 --> 01:32:13,739
Reckon you could work your way up
above where that fella's hiding?

1178
01:32:14,077 --> 01:32:17,706
Ain't never been done before.
Straight 1,000 feet.

1179
01:32:18,148 --> 01:32:21,117
I don't know. I'll take a try at it.

1180
01:32:22,185 --> 01:32:25,814
There's the Sheriff talking with a man
with a queer-looking rifle.

1181
01:32:25,889 --> 01:32:28,881
Any minute now,
it may be curtains for Roy Earle.

1182
01:32:28,958 --> 01:32:32,485
This seems to be the coldest place in
the world tonight. Cold and unreal.

1183
01:32:32,562 --> 01:32:35,531
One is awed by the gruesomeness
of this rendezvous with death.

1184
01:32:35,598 --> 01:32:38,499
The morbidly curious onlookers watching
as if it were a game.

1185
01:32:38,568 --> 01:32:42,334
The tall pine trees,
clustered around like a silent jury.

1186
01:32:42,405 --> 01:32:44,600
The stern-faced officers
waiting for the kill...

1187
01:32:44,674 --> 01:32:48,940
and up above a defiant gangster from
a simple farm on the flats of Indiana...

1188
01:32:49,012 --> 01:32:52,778
about to be killed on the highest
mountain peak in the United States.

1189
01:32:55,852 --> 01:32:58,446
What's the idea, you?
Get back where you belong.

1190
01:32:58,521 --> 01:33:01,046
Anybody else tries that'll get run in. See?

1191
01:33:08,465 --> 01:33:12,231
What are you up to, sister?
Why did you try to get through this line?

1192
01:33:12,702 --> 01:33:16,365
What did you mean to do?
Have you a little dog in that basket?

1193
01:33:16,940 --> 01:33:18,931
A little gray-white dog?

1194
01:33:23,446 --> 01:33:24,504
Boy.

1195
01:33:28,718 --> 01:33:29,946
What's the matter with her?

1196
01:33:30,019 --> 01:33:32,453
Earle's been traveling
with a girl called Marie.

1197
01:33:32,522 --> 01:33:34,353
Sure, I know. What about it?

1198
01:33:34,624 --> 01:33:35,989
Meet Marie.

1199
01:33:36,626 --> 01:33:38,389
Hey, Sheriff!

1200
01:33:56,346 --> 01:33:58,576
I guess Slim couldn't make it.

1201
01:34:06,089 --> 01:34:09,490
Listen, you. For the last time,
I'm telling you to call Earle.

1202
01:34:09,559 --> 01:34:11,322
If you don't get wise to yourself...

1203
01:34:11,394 --> 01:34:13,555
Wait a minute, George. Look, Marie.

1204
01:34:14,163 --> 01:34:16,597
It's dawn now,
and we can't wait any longer.

1205
01:34:16,666 --> 01:34:19,260
We don't want to kill your man
unless we have to.

1206
01:34:19,335 --> 01:34:22,736
Why don't you tell him to come down
and surrender peaceably?

1207
01:34:23,139 --> 01:34:25,767
If you help us now, it'll go easier with you.

1208
01:34:26,142 --> 01:34:28,007
I'm not thinking of myself.

1209
01:34:28,211 --> 01:34:33,080
Be smart. Just yell up to him and tell him
to put his gun away and come down.

1210
01:34:33,750 --> 01:34:35,650
Otherwise, we'll get him sure.

1211
01:34:41,357 --> 01:34:42,688
All right.

1212
01:34:49,432 --> 01:34:50,831
Go ahead and yell.

1213
01:34:53,136 --> 01:34:54,160
No, I won't.

1214
01:34:54,237 --> 01:34:55,898
- What's that?
- I won't, I tell you.

1215
01:34:55,972 --> 01:34:57,872
- We'll get him, then.
- He'll die anyway.

1216
01:34:57,941 --> 01:35:00,637
He'd rather it was this way.
Go on, kill him, all of you!

1217
01:35:00,710 --> 01:35:02,541
Kill him! Do you hear?

1218
01:35:04,647 --> 01:35:06,581
Okay, lady, we're through.

1219
01:35:10,286 --> 01:35:13,483
Earle, come down, it's your last chance!

1220
01:35:13,856 --> 01:35:16,689
Come and get me,
there's plenty of you down there!

1221
01:35:19,262 --> 01:35:21,230
I'm telling you it's your last chance!

1222
01:35:21,297 --> 01:35:23,288
That's what you say, copper!

1223
01:37:43,339 --> 01:37:47,036
Big-shot Earle. Well, well.

1224
01:37:48,845 --> 01:37:50,540
Look at him lying there.

1225
01:37:51,414 --> 01:37:53,177
He ain't much now, is he?

1226
01:38:03,126 --> 01:38:04,616
What does it mean...

1227
01:38:05,962 --> 01:38:09,022
when a man crashes out?

1228
01:38:09,799 --> 01:38:11,061
Crashes out?

1229
01:38:12,235 --> 01:38:15,102
That's a funny question
for you to ask now, sister.

1230
01:38:16,372 --> 01:38:17,805
It means he's free.

1231
01:38:25,615 --> 01:38:26,604
Free?

1232
01:38:44,367 --> 01:38:45,356
Free.

1233
01:39:06,389 --> 01:39:09,881
English
