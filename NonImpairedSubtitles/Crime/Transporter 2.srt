1
00:01:48,375 --> 00:01:52,055
I'm so sorry.
Can you help me? My tire...

2
00:01:52,215 --> 00:01:55,415
Sorry. I have an appointment.
I don't like to be late.

3
00:01:55,695 --> 00:01:58,256
Well, would you rather be late or dead?

4
00:02:00,015 --> 00:02:03,735
- You don't want to do this.
- Step out of the car.

5
00:02:10,376 --> 00:02:12,455
Whoo! Let's go, fellas!

6
00:02:12,656 --> 00:02:15,536
Come on, baby! Yes!

7
00:02:15,736 --> 00:02:17,936
Take it easy. The car's brand-new.

8
00:02:18,136 --> 00:02:23,016
- No problem, buddy. I got this.
- Baby, let's ride. Time to go.

9
00:02:23,296 --> 00:02:24,953
- Your parents know the kind of
company you're keeping?

10
00:02:24,955 --> 00:02:25,903
- Shut up.

11
00:02:27,696 --> 00:02:29,616
- This shit ain't working.
- It's coded.

12
00:02:29,817 --> 00:02:31,737
- What's the code?
- I can't give you that.

13
00:02:31,937 --> 00:02:35,016
We'll have to beat it out of you.
Get out the car.

14
00:02:35,297 --> 00:02:38,177
Come on, man. What you got for me?

15
00:02:38,376 --> 00:02:41,057
Kick your ass!

16
00:02:41,537 --> 00:02:43,537
Hold on.

17
00:02:43,737 --> 00:02:46,897
It just came out of the dry cleaner's.

18
00:03:06,178 --> 00:03:09,818
Hands up.
Stop moving or I will shoot you.

19
00:03:10,018 --> 00:03:12,498
Don't you have homework to do?

20
00:03:14,418 --> 00:03:17,778
- Why don't you go and do it?
- OK. I'm sorry.

21
00:03:21,698 --> 00:03:23,819
Late.

22
00:04:29,821 --> 00:04:32,101
Hey! Hey!

23
00:04:33,061 --> 00:04:37,382
- The game, the game, the game!
- What's the first rule when entering a man's car?

24
00:04:37,661 --> 00:04:41,301
- Respect a man's car, a man respects you.
- Rule number two.

25
00:04:41,501 --> 00:04:45,422
- Greet the man. Good afternoon, Frank.
- Good afternoon, Jack.

26
00:04:45,742 --> 00:04:49,262
- Can we play the game?
- I should think you'd be tired after school.

27
00:04:49,582 --> 00:04:53,102
- You're afraid I'm gonna win.
- You'll be too worn out to do your homework.

28
00:04:53,302 --> 00:04:57,062
- It's Friday. I don't have any homework.
- In that case, the game.

29
00:04:57,342 --> 00:05:01,662
- Yes!
- But first, what's the third rule of the car?

30
00:05:01,942 --> 00:05:03,262
Good.

31
00:05:18,903 --> 00:05:23,423
Five points. I'm white,
I'm round, but I'm not always around.

32
00:05:23,703 --> 00:05:26,503
- A tennis ball?
- Tennis balls are yellow.

33
00:05:39,343 --> 00:05:40,984
Four points.

34
00:05:41,143 --> 00:05:44,824
Sometimes I'm half, sometimes I'm whole.
Sometimes a slice of me is all you know.

35
00:05:44,983 --> 00:05:47,104
- A loaf of bread?
- No.

36
00:05:52,304 --> 00:05:56,105
Three points. Sometimes I'm light,
sometimes I'm dark. Sometimes I'm both.

37
00:05:56,304 --> 00:05:58,145
- I know. A light bulb.
- No.

38
00:05:58,344 --> 00:06:00,545
- A pizza!
- No.

39
00:06:59,707 --> 00:07:02,386
Audrey. Audrey! Stop walking away from me.

40
00:07:02,667 --> 00:07:05,667
Listen, we've got to finish this conversation.

41
00:07:08,147 --> 00:07:09,987
Where's he going?

42
00:07:13,347 --> 00:07:15,627
OK, look at me. Last clue for all the points.

43
00:07:15,827 --> 00:07:20,027
Everyone wants to walk on me,
but only a happy few ever have.

44
00:07:20,348 --> 00:07:22,347
Take your time.

45
00:07:30,388 --> 00:07:33,188
- Hey, bud.
- Shh! Mom, it's the game. I'm trying to think.

46
00:07:33,468 --> 00:07:36,908
- Sorry. Hey, Frank. How are you today?
- Well, Mrs. Billings.

47
00:07:37,108 --> 00:07:40,468
- Can I team up with Mom?
- I don't know. It's not in the rules.

48
00:07:40,748 --> 00:07:44,109
Come on. What's the point in having rules
if you can't bend 'em?

49
00:07:44,308 --> 00:07:47,109
- OK. Just this once.
- Yeah!

50
00:07:47,388 --> 00:07:49,948
All right. Give me some clues.

51
00:07:50,148 --> 00:07:55,229
It's round, but not always around. It's light
sometimes, dark sometimes, or both.

52
00:07:55,509 --> 00:07:59,829
Everyone wants to walk on it,
but only a happy few ever have.

53
00:08:00,149 --> 00:08:03,469
- That is a hard one.
- Tell me about it.

54
00:08:06,669 --> 00:08:09,149
- The moon!
- Correct.

55
00:08:09,349 --> 00:08:11,429
Good job. All right. Come on.

56
00:08:11,629 --> 00:08:13,949
- See you Monday.
- Bye, Frank. Thanks.

57
00:08:14,149 --> 00:08:16,429
- Keep your snacks in the kitchen.
- Bye, Mom.

58
00:08:16,630 --> 00:08:19,510
He's really taken to you
in the month you've been with us.

59
00:08:19,710 --> 00:08:23,430
- Likewise.
- Too bad you can't stay on when Tony's back.

60
00:08:23,710 --> 00:08:26,790
It was just a favor.
I don't usually do this sort of a job.

61
00:08:27,070 --> 00:08:30,070
I thought you were a professional driver.

62
00:08:30,230 --> 00:08:32,150
A different kind of driving.

63
00:08:34,390 --> 00:08:38,310
Well, we're all gonna miss you
when you're gone.

64
00:08:44,831 --> 00:08:46,070
And...

65
00:08:46,271 --> 00:08:48,751
thank you for what you did.

66
00:08:48,950 --> 00:08:50,951
For what?

67
00:08:51,151 --> 00:08:55,191
For turning the car around so that
Jack wouldn't have to see us fighting.

68
00:08:55,471 --> 00:08:59,111
- You really know kids, don't you?
- I know fighting.

69
00:08:59,311 --> 00:09:01,711
He hasn't seen Jack in months,

70
00:09:01,911 --> 00:09:04,872
and when he gets back,
all I hear is what I'm doing wrong.

71
00:09:05,151 --> 00:09:10,431
You'd think that after being separated
for a year that he would...

72
00:09:11,792 --> 00:09:15,231
I'm sorry. You don't have to hear this.

73
00:09:15,432 --> 00:09:20,872
It's OK. For what it's worth,
I think you're doing a great job with Jack.

74
00:09:21,272 --> 00:09:22,512
Thank you.

75
00:09:22,632 --> 00:09:25,312
Any time I can be of help,
if there's anything you need.

76
00:09:25,472 --> 00:09:28,272
That's really sweet of you, Frank.

77
00:09:28,552 --> 00:09:31,153
I might have to take you up on it.

78
00:09:33,913 --> 00:09:39,033
I almost forgot. I'm supposed to take Jack to
the doctor tomorrow morning for a checkup,

79
00:09:39,313 --> 00:09:43,713
but I'm organizing a party for him, even
though his birthday's not until next week.

80
00:09:46,513 --> 00:09:51,753
So, while I decorate and his friends arrive,
I was thinking, if you wouldn't mind...

81
00:09:52,153 --> 00:09:55,113
- I'll take him.
- I feel funny cutting into your weekend.

82
00:09:55,313 --> 00:09:58,274
I'm just picking up a friend at the airport
later on in the day.

83
00:09:58,593 --> 00:10:00,794
- That's nice.
- What is?

84
00:10:00,993 --> 00:10:03,953
The guys on security
say you're a bit of a loner. Um...

85
00:10:04,154 --> 00:10:08,554
- So it's just nice to hear you have a friend.
- He's not really a friend.

86
00:10:08,834 --> 00:10:10,954
He's French.

87
00:10:11,153 --> 00:10:13,714
I'll call you back.

88
00:10:13,914 --> 00:10:16,914
Audrey. I'd like to finish our conversation.

89
00:10:21,994 --> 00:10:24,754
If anything comes up before then,
you have my cell.

90
00:10:24,954 --> 00:10:28,875
- Nothing will come up, Mrs. Billings.
- Audrey.

91
00:10:29,154 --> 00:10:30,515
Audrey.

92
00:10:59,476 --> 00:11:02,275
- Yeah, hello?
- Confirmed for tomorrow. 9am.

93
00:11:48,877 --> 00:11:52,518
Tomorrow, 9am. Only change -
the driver'll be taking him, not the mother.

94
00:11:52,718 --> 00:11:53,958
Even better.

95
00:12:00,078 --> 00:12:02,878
Vasily?

96
00:12:12,478 --> 00:12:15,038
- Is it stable?
- Yes, it's stable.

97
00:12:15,158 --> 00:12:17,359
And the antidote?

98
00:12:24,838 --> 00:12:26,359
See you tomorrow.

99
00:12:37,599 --> 00:12:40,959
The drug-enforcement ministers
of six Latin American countries

100
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:43,239
arrived in Miami for a summit meeting...

101
00:12:43,439 --> 00:12:46,600
Yeah. Martin, Frank.
1156 Palmeadow.

102
00:12:46,799 --> 00:12:51,479
I'm waiting for an express delivery.
That's what you told me 45 minutes ago.

103
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:55,440
I don't need anything else.
Just get me the pizza.

104
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:58,200
- I'm not paying for that...
- Hi.

105
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:00,400
Hi.

106
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:05,800
So, it's one medium pie, no mozzarella,
extra olives and extra anchovies,

107
00:13:06,081 --> 00:13:08,200
which amounts to $11.95.

108
00:13:08,361 --> 00:13:10,881
- I hope you're hungry.
- You have no idea.

109
00:13:11,081 --> 00:13:14,121
I apologize for the delay, sir.

110
00:13:15,561 --> 00:13:17,481
Mrs. Billings.

111
00:13:19,321 --> 00:13:22,281
Audrey. Audrey.

112
00:13:23,041 --> 00:13:26,321
- What are you doing?
- What does it look like I'm doing?

113
00:13:26,521 --> 00:13:30,442
- Have you been drinking?
- A little.

114
00:13:32,362 --> 00:13:35,242
You said if I needed anything.

115
00:13:35,441 --> 00:13:39,241
- I can't.
- Why? Because of who I am?

116
00:13:40,522 --> 00:13:42,802
Because of who I am.

117
00:13:52,202 --> 00:13:55,842
I feel so lost. So confused.

118
00:13:57,203 --> 00:13:59,322
Who isn't?

119
00:14:08,882 --> 00:14:11,402
Thank you, Frank.

120
00:14:12,363 --> 00:14:14,923
For the time and...

121
00:14:15,123 --> 00:14:17,723
your respect.

122
00:14:17,923 --> 00:14:20,603
I think it's what I needed the most.

123
00:14:22,803 --> 00:14:24,523
Bye.

124
00:14:55,525 --> 00:14:58,285
- Am I gonna get a shot?
- I don't know.

125
00:15:20,165 --> 00:15:24,646
- Jeez. We're not open yet.
- I need to see the doctor immediately.

126
00:15:24,965 --> 00:15:28,966
Right. Dr. Koblin, if you'll come out here,
please. We have an issue.

127
00:15:29,285 --> 00:15:31,565
You'll have to state the medical problem.

128
00:15:31,766 --> 00:15:36,646
Actually, my problem's not medical.
It's psychological.

129
00:15:36,926 --> 00:15:39,326
Yes, Laura. What seems to be the problem?

130
00:15:39,526 --> 00:15:40,966
Me.

131
00:15:41,646 --> 00:15:43,926
I hate shots.

132
00:15:44,127 --> 00:15:47,686
Number one, there's no guarantee
you're getting a shot.

133
00:15:47,967 --> 00:15:51,726
There's no sense getting worked up
over something that might not happen.

134
00:15:57,846 --> 00:15:59,967
- Give me the news.
- Doctor said I'm cured.

135
00:16:00,807 --> 00:16:04,647
- Frank, it hurts a lot.
- I'd never let anyone hurt you a lot.

136
00:16:04,927 --> 00:16:07,647
- Promise?
- You know my fourth rule?

137
00:16:07,807 --> 00:16:11,767
Never make a promise
you can't keep. Come on.

138
00:16:13,847 --> 00:16:15,967
Close the door.

139
00:16:24,127 --> 00:16:25,368
Come on.

140
00:16:31,408 --> 00:16:34,288
- May I help you?
- Jack Billings to see Dr. Koblin.

141
00:16:34,488 --> 00:16:37,169
He's out sick today. He'll be seeing Dr. Tyberg.

142
00:16:37,448 --> 00:16:41,288
- I like Dr. Koblin.
- Don't worry. Dr. Tyberg's very nice.

143
00:16:41,489 --> 00:16:43,489
Just take him into room 3.

144
00:16:43,688 --> 00:16:45,329
- Where's Laura?
- Who?

145
00:16:45,529 --> 00:16:48,968
- You're standing at her desk.
- That Laura. She's out sick too.

146
00:16:49,249 --> 00:16:53,009
There's a lot of flu going around.
Now, come on. Doctor's got a busy day.

147
00:16:53,169 --> 00:16:56,169
Come on. It'll be over before you know it.

148
00:16:57,689 --> 00:16:59,529
Hey, hey!

149
00:17:00,289 --> 00:17:02,689
I'm Dr. Tyberg.

150
00:17:02,970 --> 00:17:04,890
Can't I wait for my doctor?

151
00:17:04,969 --> 00:17:07,969
Your doctor was called away
on an emergency.

152
00:17:08,250 --> 00:17:11,130
- The nurse said he had the flu.
- That was the emergency.

153
00:17:11,330 --> 00:17:17,370
He came down with flu, very quickly.
So, the sooner we start, the sooner we finish.

154
00:17:17,730 --> 00:17:20,890
Come. I show you something very cool.

155
00:17:21,090 --> 00:17:24,370
I'm sorry. Doctor-patient privacy in room.

156
00:17:24,650 --> 00:17:27,730
You can wait in reception area,
or glass of water, or...

157
00:17:27,890 --> 00:17:31,850
Hey, trust me. I am doctor.

158
00:17:32,131 --> 00:17:34,130
Please. It's phone.

159
00:17:37,291 --> 00:17:40,851
<i>- Yeah?
- Allô, allô.  Frank? I am here.</i>

160
00:17:41,131 --> 00:17:43,810
- You're early.
- Yeah, we had fantastic tailwinds.

161
00:17:44,011 --> 00:17:46,531
Put two hours on my vacation, just like that.

162
00:17:46,691 --> 00:17:50,251
From now on, it's the only way I'm flying.
Tailwinds or nothing.

163
00:17:50,531 --> 00:17:53,211
Glad you made it.

164
00:17:54,771 --> 00:17:59,571
Hello. Sorry, Dr. Dunietz is not in today.
Call back Monday.

165
00:18:05,132 --> 00:18:08,771
I'm a little tied up. You mind taking a cab?
You have the address, yes?

166
00:18:09,052 --> 00:18:14,612
Oh, thank you. I heard the fish down here
is fantastic. I could make us a bouillabaisse.

167
00:18:14,892 --> 00:18:17,412
You like bouillabaisse, Frank, no?

168
00:18:18,452 --> 00:18:20,652
I gotta go.

169
00:18:20,852 --> 00:18:21,892
Frank!

170
00:18:22,012 --> 00:18:24,492
Maybe we'll wait for his regular doctor.

171
00:18:24,693 --> 00:18:27,093
It's important that he receives immunizations.

172
00:18:27,372 --> 00:18:31,013
- I'm sure. But a week won't make a difference.
- No, we're doing it now.

173
00:18:52,493 --> 00:18:54,214
Get going, Jack!

174
00:20:02,136 --> 00:20:04,696
Look at me. Look at me.

175
00:20:04,896 --> 00:20:07,776
- Remember my promise?
- Yes.

176
00:20:27,737 --> 00:20:29,737
- It's... It's me!
- Get out!

177
00:20:34,057 --> 00:20:35,978
Frank.

178
00:21:04,378 --> 00:21:05,538
Shit.

179
00:21:14,139 --> 00:21:18,259
The patient's not cooperating.
Prep the vehicle.

180
00:21:31,300 --> 00:21:33,700
Come on, hurry.

181
00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:39,859
Don't worry. Everything's gonna be OK.

182
00:22:06,341 --> 00:22:10,061
- Freeze! Put your guns on the ground!
- Get down!

183
00:22:11,101 --> 00:22:13,621
<i>- Si.
- They got away.</i>

184
00:22:13,821 --> 00:22:15,421
<i>- Cazzo!
- Plan B?</i>

185
00:22:17,741 --> 00:22:18,701
Yes. Plan B.

186
00:22:37,022 --> 00:22:39,422
Oh, you made it.

187
00:22:39,622 --> 00:22:42,182
- Oh, what's that?
- Jack's birthday present.

188
00:22:42,382 --> 00:22:45,542
Baseball uniform, cleats, glove and a bat.

189
00:22:47,942 --> 00:22:51,583
- It's his favorite sport.
- It was. Last year.

190
00:22:51,782 --> 00:22:54,583
He's on a soccer team now. He's good.

191
00:22:54,862 --> 00:22:58,102
- You know, you should see him sometime.
- Hello.

192
00:22:58,303 --> 00:23:02,422
- Mr. And Mrs. Billings! They're coming!
- Hide, everyone. Hide!

193
00:23:09,703 --> 00:23:11,743
- Yes.
- Good morning, Mr. Driver.

194
00:23:11,943 --> 00:23:15,464
- Who is this?
- Look in your rear-view mirror and you'll see.

195
00:23:16,904 --> 00:23:19,424
I know what you're thinking.
Bulletproof glass.

196
00:23:19,503 --> 00:23:24,503
So tell me, in your experience - which judging
from the performance you put on in the office

197
00:23:24,784 --> 00:23:27,064
goes way beyond driving children to school -

198
00:23:27,383 --> 00:23:31,184
does bulletproof glass stop
a 7.62 armor-piercing round?

199
00:23:31,384 --> 00:23:34,664
Frank, why have you stopped the car?

200
00:23:37,424 --> 00:23:40,104
Don't look,
they are triangulated over 300 feet away.

201
00:23:40,304 --> 00:23:41,544
Frank, pick up.

202
00:23:41,745 --> 00:23:46,744
You screwed up my plan.
I am going to tell you how to set things right.

203
00:23:47,025 --> 00:23:50,465
Someone is going to appear in a few seconds.

204
00:24:01,705 --> 00:24:03,625
Let her in.

205
00:24:10,505 --> 00:24:13,025
Driver.

206
00:24:13,105 --> 00:24:16,266
Good boy. Good boy.

207
00:24:20,506 --> 00:24:21,666
Hi.

208
00:24:22,626 --> 00:24:24,546
Leave it on.

209
00:24:26,746 --> 00:24:31,146
Personally, I hate kids. I don't know
what your feelings are on the subject,

210
00:24:31,426 --> 00:24:36,626
but if you ever want to have any, make
no moves but the moves I tell you to make.

211
00:24:36,906 --> 00:24:41,426
You're in her hands now. They can be gentle
hands, but they can be the hands from hell.

212
00:24:41,706 --> 00:24:44,947
- Trust me on this one.
- Trust him on this one.

213
00:24:45,227 --> 00:24:47,066
Now, drive.

214
00:25:27,428 --> 00:25:29,348
Make a left.

215
00:25:29,548 --> 00:25:31,069
I said left.

216
00:25:51,429 --> 00:25:55,269
Listen, we keep doing this your way,
they're gonna catch us.

217
00:25:55,550 --> 00:25:58,229
- Do this my way, no one gets hurt.
- Where's the fun in that?

218
00:25:58,430 --> 00:26:00,909
Let's save the fun for later.

219
00:26:08,390 --> 00:26:09,470
Hey!

220
00:27:48,793 --> 00:27:49,874
Not bad.

221
00:27:50,073 --> 00:27:52,554
Didn't your mother
teach you to say thank you?

222
00:27:52,754 --> 00:27:54,674
She tried, and failed miserably.

223
00:27:54,834 --> 00:27:58,514
- I think we lost them.
- Think again.

224
00:28:02,914 --> 00:28:05,314
Thought complete. Let's go.

225
00:28:33,795 --> 00:28:38,675
You can't find him? He's one man in one car.
He's a chauffeur, for chrissakes.

226
00:28:38,955 --> 00:28:42,035
Not exactly, sir.
There's a possibility he was in on it.

227
00:28:42,315 --> 00:28:44,915
- That's impossible.
- How would you know?

228
00:28:45,116 --> 00:28:49,156
He could have been setting this up the
whole time, and you wouldn't have known.

229
00:28:49,436 --> 00:28:53,356
- And you are an expert on knowing people.
- His background.

230
00:28:54,516 --> 00:28:58,716
He's ex-Special Forces. Headed a commando
unit. Specialized in search and destroy.

231
00:28:58,996 --> 00:29:02,676
Been in and out of Lebanon, Syria, Sudan.
The man is a hunter.

232
00:29:02,956 --> 00:29:05,356
I don't care what his skills are
or where he's from.

233
00:29:05,556 --> 00:29:08,397
This is not a war zone,
this is an American city!

234
00:29:08,596 --> 00:29:10,716
Where's my son?

235
00:29:37,678 --> 00:29:39,958
Last stop. All out.

236
00:29:42,277 --> 00:29:46,478
You're quite a guy.
Another time, another place -

237
00:29:46,758 --> 00:29:50,438
you and me, baby,
the pleasure we could have.

238
00:29:56,078 --> 00:29:57,918
Beauty.

239
00:29:58,679 --> 00:30:01,158
Frank.

240
00:30:02,318 --> 00:30:03,278
Frank!

241
00:30:05,479 --> 00:30:06,518
Frank!

242
00:30:06,719 --> 00:30:11,599
Not what you expected when you reported
for work this morning, is it, Frank? No?

243
00:30:11,919 --> 00:30:14,799
Is that what passes for wit in this circle?

244
00:30:14,959 --> 00:30:18,519
In this circle, my friend,
wit is not a requirement of the job.

245
00:30:18,799 --> 00:30:22,359
Brutality, yes.
An ability to inflict pain, absolutely.

246
00:30:22,639 --> 00:30:27,999
A certain psychotic, moral ignorance,
blind obedience, all required.

247
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:30,600
- But not wit. How was it?
- Fun.

248
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:33,600
Only the beginning, my love.

249
00:30:34,719 --> 00:30:37,600
- What's this all about?
- A timely question.

250
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:39,720
Max.

251
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:42,000
Pardon me.

252
00:30:49,681 --> 00:30:53,320
- Hello.
- Put me on the speaker.

253
00:30:53,641 --> 00:30:57,361
In the next two hours,
you'll get five million dollars in $100 bills.

254
00:30:57,640 --> 00:31:01,281
Put them in a waterproof suitcase,
go to the Bayfront Park - personally.

255
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:05,601
There will be a blue Chrysler parked there.
Place the suitcase in the trunk, and leave.

256
00:31:05,881 --> 00:31:08,761
I don't know if I can get
five million dollars in two hours.

257
00:31:08,961 --> 00:31:12,721
I read the newspapers. When you were
appointed to your current position,

258
00:31:12,921 --> 00:31:16,721
your net worth exceeded 100 million dollars,
so you won't even feel the bite.

259
00:31:17,042 --> 00:31:20,282
What guarantee do I have
that you won't harm my son?

260
00:31:21,441 --> 00:31:24,322
"Guarantee"? Mr. Billings,
I am not a car dealer.

261
00:31:24,521 --> 00:31:28,241
Don't let the charming accent
and my impeccable syntax mislead you.

262
00:31:28,522 --> 00:31:32,002
I live in the jungle, and in the jungle
you either eat or be eaten.

263
00:31:32,162 --> 00:31:34,962
But, in the spirit of business,
here is the guarantee.

264
00:31:35,242 --> 00:31:38,682
Ten minutes past the deadline,
if the money doesn't arrive, I send a finger.

265
00:31:38,882 --> 00:31:42,442
20 minutes, a hand. 30 minutes, a foot.

266
00:31:42,723 --> 00:31:45,243
Sounds like we have a deal.

267
00:31:45,402 --> 00:31:47,722
You have a deal.

268
00:31:48,762 --> 00:31:51,363
Could we please speak to our son?

269
00:31:52,803 --> 00:31:54,803
Mommy! Mommy!

270
00:31:55,883 --> 00:31:59,883
You have two hours, Mr. Billings.
Starting now.

271
00:32:01,923 --> 00:32:05,283
- Just get my son!
- All right. All right.

272
00:32:05,563 --> 00:32:09,004
Frank, you promised
you wouldn't let anybody hurt me!

273
00:32:09,203 --> 00:32:13,243
- You promised!
- Never make promises you can't keep.

274
00:32:13,523 --> 00:32:16,684
I don't. It's one of my rules.

275
00:32:16,884 --> 00:32:18,204
Wow.

276
00:32:18,324 --> 00:32:24,084
Bravo. A man who leads his life by rules.
In my world rules are meant to be broken.

277
00:32:24,444 --> 00:32:28,684
- Not mine.
- You're gonna have to make an exception.

278
00:32:28,964 --> 00:32:30,884
Go.

279
00:32:58,205 --> 00:33:00,606
<i>Prego. </i>

280
00:33:11,526 --> 00:33:13,086
- Go.
- Hey, driver!

281
00:33:16,245 --> 00:33:21,246
No, no, wait, wait.
A little distance between us isn't a bad thing.

282
00:33:22,006 --> 00:33:23,926
<i>Andiamo!</i>

283
00:33:31,886 --> 00:33:34,087
Now.

284
00:34:07,088 --> 00:34:09,088
Hold on. The signal.

285
00:34:09,287 --> 00:34:11,688
- Hello.
- It's me.

286
00:34:11,848 --> 00:34:14,848
- You son of a bitch.
- Look, I had nothing to do with this.

287
00:34:15,128 --> 00:34:18,488
- One scratch on his head...
- Let me speak to who's in charge.

288
00:34:18,688 --> 00:34:22,209
- This is US Marshal Stappleton.
- Act fast. There are three boats.

289
00:34:22,528 --> 00:34:25,569
- Tell us where you are.
- Get a plane. They're heading north.

290
00:34:25,768 --> 00:34:28,648
- Tell me where you are.
- Just tell us where you are!

291
00:34:28,929 --> 00:34:30,648
Hello, Frank?

292
00:34:31,128 --> 00:34:33,249
Got it.

293
00:35:00,090 --> 00:35:02,490
<i>- Allô.
- Tarconi, it's me. Get out of the house.</i>

294
00:35:02,689 --> 00:35:06,610
- I was just putting the Madeleines...
- Forget the Madeleines, just get out.

295
00:35:06,930 --> 00:35:09,330
- And go where?
- Anywhere. Go to the beach.

296
00:35:09,490 --> 00:35:12,770
Oh, the beach. The famous Miami Beach.

297
00:35:13,050 --> 00:35:16,811
Oh, my dream.
I would love to go to the beach.

298
00:35:20,171 --> 00:35:21,770
Maybe not.

299
00:35:21,890 --> 00:35:25,250
- Freeze! Who the fuck are you?
- I'm the cook.

300
00:35:27,451 --> 00:35:30,611
Oh. This is a mistake. A terrible mistake.

301
00:35:32,731 --> 00:35:36,931
Why we can't all just get along, you know?

302
00:35:52,172 --> 00:35:56,132
- Hello.
- It's Frank. Pretend it's someone else.

303
00:35:58,532 --> 00:36:00,252
Hi, Susan.

304
00:36:00,812 --> 00:36:02,812
No, I'm just here at home.

305
00:36:03,012 --> 00:36:06,172
I didn't do it, Audrey.
She had a gun on Jack. I had no choice.

306
00:36:06,372 --> 00:36:10,612
Yeah, I saw that. What do you know?

307
00:36:10,892 --> 00:36:13,573
- It's more than a kidnapping.
- They asked for a ransom.

308
00:36:13,772 --> 00:36:19,533
The doctors, they were fake. They were trying
to give Jack a shot. When I interrupted them...

309
00:36:21,532 --> 00:36:26,133
I promised Jack I wouldn't let anyone
hurt him. I'm not gonna break that promise.

310
00:36:26,413 --> 00:36:28,453
- Frank.
- I'll call you back.

311
00:36:31,493 --> 00:36:33,614
Audrey.

312
00:36:33,813 --> 00:36:39,573
- Is everything all right?
- That's a pretty stupid question to ask, Jeff.

313
00:36:45,974 --> 00:36:49,613
All right. So tell me again, Inspector Tarconi,

314
00:36:49,934 --> 00:36:55,214
why you didn't immediately
identify yourself as a police officer.

315
00:36:55,494 --> 00:37:00,574
Oh, I was overwhelmed
by the effectiveness of your operation,

316
00:37:00,934 --> 00:37:03,054
the sophistication of your equipment.

317
00:37:03,255 --> 00:37:08,535
You know, I work in a small office
in a small town. We only have small crimes.

318
00:37:08,814 --> 00:37:12,455
- I must admit I was a little insecure.
- You and Frank Martin are friends, right?

319
00:37:12,735 --> 00:37:18,295
A friend? Oh, I wouldn't say exactly a friend.
I know him, we have a relationship.

320
00:37:18,615 --> 00:37:20,535
A long relationship?

321
00:37:20,695 --> 00:37:23,295
- Not so long.
- But they found you cooking in his house.

322
00:37:23,495 --> 00:37:24,735
- I'm French!
- So?

323
00:37:24,935 --> 00:37:29,615
We don't need to know someone for long time in
order to cook for them. It's our way of breaking the ice.

324
00:37:29,896 --> 00:37:34,535
Take, for example, this sandwich
and coffee you so graciously offer me.

325
00:37:34,816 --> 00:37:37,855
Well, pardon me to think so,
but it's not very good.

326
00:37:38,056 --> 00:37:40,656
I know it sucks, but what's that
got to do with anything?

327
00:37:40,936 --> 00:37:42,016
Do you have a kitchen?

328
00:37:44,416 --> 00:37:46,296
Stay back. Stay back.

329
00:39:08,499 --> 00:39:11,179
Don't move. Smith!

330
00:39:11,299 --> 00:39:13,219
Drop it.

331
00:39:38,140 --> 00:39:40,620
Oh, Jesus. What happened?

332
00:39:40,821 --> 00:39:43,900
We'll take care of it for you.

333
00:39:49,740 --> 00:39:52,421
- Are you sure this safe?
- Look over your shoulder.

334
00:39:52,620 --> 00:39:55,020
We got you covered.

335
00:40:03,541 --> 00:40:10,061
As my mother used to say,
a meal is only limited by your imagination.

336
00:40:10,462 --> 00:40:12,862
<i>- Crème brûlée et croque monsieur.
- Cream brûlée?</i>

337
00:40:13,061 --> 00:40:14,221
- Crème brûlée.
- Cock?

338
00:40:14,381 --> 00:40:16,902
- Croque monsieur.
- Croque monsieur.

339
00:40:18,421 --> 00:40:20,262
<i>- Oui?
- Where are you?</i>

340
00:40:20,422 --> 00:40:23,502
- Cooking.
- Cooking. Can you talk?

341
00:40:23,702 --> 00:40:26,782
- Oh, speak of the devil. My mother.
- Mom.

342
00:40:26,942 --> 00:40:30,022
Please, do you mind?

343
00:40:30,302 --> 00:40:31,662
Thank you.

344
00:40:31,742 --> 00:40:33,662
<i>Oui, Maman. Je suis très bien arrivé. </i>

345
00:40:33,863 --> 00:40:37,622
<i>Oui, très très bien, merci. Oui.
Ah, oui, c'est une très jolie ville. </i>

346
00:40:37,902 --> 00:40:41,543
- May I ask who you're cooking for?
- For the US marshals.

347
00:40:41,822 --> 00:40:47,023
Once they found my badge, they were very
polite. They gave me a coffee and a sandwich.

348
00:40:47,303 --> 00:40:49,783
You wouldn't believe what passes
for food in this place, Frank.

349
00:40:49,982 --> 00:40:55,063
I am correcting the situation while they wait
for my chief to call back and confirm everything.

350
00:40:55,463 --> 00:40:59,943
Of course, that might take a while.
He's never there.

351
00:41:00,144 --> 00:41:03,303
- Anything about me?
- They are very interested about you.

352
00:41:03,504 --> 00:41:07,143
They want to know where you are.
Where are you?

353
00:41:07,423 --> 00:41:10,424
Nowhere for very long. Listen, hold on.

354
00:41:14,223 --> 00:41:16,944
Do you have access to a computer?

355
00:41:17,104 --> 00:41:20,584
Easier than having access
to something decent to eat.

356
00:41:35,265 --> 00:41:39,544
- Oh, handsome fellow. Who is he?
- That's what I need to know. Do they have an ID program?

357
00:41:39,745 --> 00:41:45,305
Forgive me. I'm not so used to this system.
Back home, there is one computer for ten of us.

358
00:41:45,705 --> 00:41:47,905
So, how is it with you, Frank?

359
00:41:48,105 --> 00:41:51,345
- It's a complicated story.
- Ah, you mean you are in the shit?

360
00:41:51,665 --> 00:41:55,385
- You might say that.
- In other words, your natural state.

361
00:41:55,586 --> 00:41:57,026
Voilà.

362
00:41:57,105 --> 00:42:03,346
A Russian biologist with advanced degrees from
the state laboratory for biological warfare in Siberia.

363
00:42:03,746 --> 00:42:09,106
- Do we have an address?
- Miami, Boca West, King Street, number 11.

364
00:43:48,350 --> 00:43:49,989
Get out!

365
00:44:15,031 --> 00:44:16,671
Hey!

366
00:44:20,191 --> 00:44:23,751
- What are you doing?
- Trying to catch a bus.

367
00:44:25,951 --> 00:44:27,671
Come on.

368
00:44:42,832 --> 00:44:47,152
What are you doing, driver?
Not so good on the water, hey?

369
00:44:50,512 --> 00:44:51,872
Stop it! Stop it!

370
00:45:21,673 --> 00:45:24,353
- OK. OK.
- Tell me about the doctor's office.

371
00:45:24,473 --> 00:45:27,713
- What doctor's office?
- Where you tried to stick the kid with this.

372
00:45:28,033 --> 00:45:30,034
You want to tell me?

373
00:45:39,234 --> 00:45:42,394
Do you know what you have done?
Do you know what you have done?

374
00:45:42,594 --> 00:45:47,394
Obviously something not conducive to your good health,
which is all I needed to know in the first place.

375
00:45:47,674 --> 00:45:50,074
Have a good life...

376
00:45:50,274 --> 00:45:52,394
what's left of it.

377
00:46:06,674 --> 00:46:10,995
- Outpost to base. The ransom is still there.
- Thanks.

378
00:46:11,275 --> 00:46:13,075
The ransom hasn't been picked up.

379
00:46:13,275 --> 00:46:16,355
- Don't worry.
- What if it's not just a kidnapping?

380
00:46:16,635 --> 00:46:20,955
- I've worked on many kidnapping cases.
- If they don't take it I won't get my son back.

381
00:46:21,156 --> 00:46:23,916
Don't make this
any more complicated than it is.

382
00:46:24,235 --> 00:46:27,955
I'm not making this complicated, Jefferson.
It's because of your job.

383
00:46:28,035 --> 00:46:31,716
- What does my job have to do with this?
- It has everything to do with it.

384
00:46:31,995 --> 00:46:35,156
Because you became famous,
we became the targets.

385
00:46:35,436 --> 00:46:40,796
No matter what you think, the only one who's
out there trying to get Jack back is Frank.

386
00:46:41,076 --> 00:46:43,476
- The chauffeur?
- You spoke to Frank Martin?

387
00:46:43,676 --> 00:46:48,956
- What the hell are you doing talking to him?
- Because he's the last person who saw Jack alive!

388
00:46:49,237 --> 00:46:50,956
We've found the boy.

389
00:47:16,197 --> 00:47:17,637
Hard drive blew.

390
00:47:17,717 --> 00:47:19,637
- Get another one in there.
- Yes, sir.

391
00:47:19,757 --> 00:47:23,117
- How long is it gonna take?
- Ma'am, we're going as fast as we can.

392
00:47:23,398 --> 00:47:25,678
- He can suffocate in there.
- Stay calm.

393
00:47:25,877 --> 00:47:27,797
- It's my son!
- Let them work.

394
00:47:27,998 --> 00:47:30,758
- Are you gonna sit and do nothing?
- They're experts.

395
00:47:30,958 --> 00:47:34,518
Everyone is an expert!
I've had it with all of you!

396
00:47:34,798 --> 00:47:36,158
Audrey!

397
00:47:39,519 --> 00:47:41,718
Audrey!

398
00:47:41,998 --> 00:47:43,518
Audrey!

399
00:47:48,119 --> 00:47:49,559
Audrey!

400
00:47:51,879 --> 00:47:54,078
Mommy!

401
00:47:56,478 --> 00:47:58,479
Jack!

402
00:47:59,159 --> 00:48:01,279
Are you OK?

403
00:48:06,079 --> 00:48:08,759
There you go, little buddy.

404
00:48:12,880 --> 00:48:15,760
Breathe. Come on, breathe.

405
00:48:15,960 --> 00:48:19,200
- You're the devil.
- I wish.

406
00:48:55,641 --> 00:49:00,162
- Shit! Dimitri, you scare shit in me.
- Where is Sonovitch?

407
00:49:00,441 --> 00:49:03,241
- In chamber.
- I need to speak with him.

408
00:49:03,522 --> 00:49:07,362
Sit down! Listen Panasonic.
Is rap music, is good.

409
00:50:43,445 --> 00:50:45,005
- What was that?
- I don't know.

410
00:50:46,325 --> 00:50:47,885
Shit!

411
00:50:47,965 --> 00:50:49,966
- What are you doing?
- I need antidote.

412
00:50:50,165 --> 00:50:53,045
The driver, he inject me with virus. Look!

413
00:50:53,326 --> 00:50:57,366
- Dimitri, where would he get the virus?
- The one we left in doctor's surgery.

414
00:50:57,445 --> 00:51:00,246
Please, I need antidote. I am sick.

415
00:51:00,526 --> 00:51:04,366
Calm down. You're not sick. You have
four hours before the virus is active.

416
00:51:04,566 --> 00:51:06,766
You know that. You worked on creating it.

417
00:51:08,006 --> 00:51:10,206
- Open fridge.
- I'm telling you...

418
00:51:11,766 --> 00:51:15,887
<i>Izvinite.  Open fridge. Open the fridge!</i>

419
00:51:16,847 --> 00:51:20,207
Yes. Insurance policy. How many you have?

420
00:51:20,366 --> 00:51:23,527
Two doses. Enough for Tipov and myself.

421
00:51:26,606 --> 00:51:30,247
Tipov's policy cancelled. There is one for me.

422
00:51:30,447 --> 00:51:32,567
And I want it now. Come on.

423
00:51:32,767 --> 00:51:35,447
Come on. Let's do it!

424
00:51:38,007 --> 00:51:39,367
- Let's not.
- Who are you?

425
00:51:39,447 --> 00:51:41,487
- There is enough for two.
- You don't need it.

426
00:51:41,688 --> 00:51:44,167
- But you injected me.
- With water.

427
00:51:44,367 --> 00:51:46,848
- I'm not sick.
- You're not sick.

428
00:51:47,047 --> 00:51:48,687
- Water.
- Water.

429
00:51:50,487 --> 00:51:51,648
Son of bitch!

430
00:51:56,401 --> 00:51:59,601
Good. Our problem is solved.
One dose for each of us.

431
00:51:58,248 --> 00:52:00,627
- It's not for us.

432
00:52:00,950 --> 00:52:04,552
- One for you and one for the child.
_ Your devotion is touching.

433
00:52:04,761 --> 00:52:06,362
My patience is about to run out.

434
00:52:13,422 --> 00:52:16,702
- Tell me about the virus.
- OK. What do you want know?

435
00:52:16,982 --> 00:52:18,502
Everything. For starters, what is it?

436
00:52:18,502 --> 00:52:21,783
A recombinant retro-immune
double-polymorphing effluent.

437
00:52:22,062 --> 00:52:26,103
The child will die. Anyone he breathes
on will die, and then it's over.

438
00:52:26,382 --> 00:52:30,582
- What do you mean, "It's over?"
- The virus is designed to go inert after 24 hours.

439
00:52:30,903 --> 00:52:34,542
Thanks for the lesson.
Now give me the vials.

440
00:52:34,743 --> 00:52:39,983
You really want to play superhero, don't you?
Well, let's see if you can fly.

441
00:53:15,104 --> 00:53:17,304
- You OK?
- I'm OK.

442
00:54:19,347 --> 00:54:24,346
There's nothing to worry about. It's just a simple viral
infection combined with the stress of what happened.

443
00:54:24,547 --> 00:54:28,107
It should pass in a day or two.
I gave him something to help him sleep.

444
00:54:28,387 --> 00:54:32,507
- Call me if anything arises.
- Thank you, Doctor.

445
00:54:34,148 --> 00:54:37,667
You know, Audrey, all this has...

446
00:54:37,947 --> 00:54:41,507
well, it's made me realize
what a fool I've been.

447
00:54:41,708 --> 00:54:43,907
With Jack...

448
00:54:44,108 --> 00:54:46,588
and with you.

449
00:54:48,988 --> 00:54:53,708
- Are you OK?
- Mr. Billings. We're running late.

450
00:54:53,988 --> 00:54:58,988
I'll be right out.
I'd like to come by after the conference,

451
00:54:59,148 --> 00:55:01,828
check on Jack.

452
00:55:02,028 --> 00:55:04,149
Check on you.

453
00:55:06,069 --> 00:55:09,309
Good. I'll see you soon.

454
00:55:09,509 --> 00:55:11,709
They're here if you need them.

455
00:55:23,349 --> 00:55:26,589
- Are you all right, ma'am?
- I'm fine.

456
00:55:29,950 --> 00:55:32,830
- Hello.
- It's me.

457
00:55:32,909 --> 00:55:34,750
- Are you OK?
- Go to your bedroom.

458
00:55:34,949 --> 00:55:37,830
Hi, Susan. How are you?

459
00:55:39,550 --> 00:55:42,510
I'm alone. Where are you, Frank?

460
00:55:42,709 --> 00:55:44,830
Turn around.

461
00:55:54,990 --> 00:55:58,350
Frank, you were wrong.
It was a kidnapping. Jack is fine.

462
00:55:58,511 --> 00:56:03,511
Jack's been infected with a virus. Anyone
who comes into contact with him will die.

463
00:56:03,791 --> 00:56:06,110
What are you telling me?

464
00:56:06,311 --> 00:56:10,631
- Are you telling me my son is gonna die?
- No, he's not.

465
00:56:12,831 --> 00:56:16,951
Once incubated, the virus becomes airborne,
so anyone he breathes on gets infected.

466
00:56:17,151 --> 00:56:19,831
Your son was a weapon.
The target is his father.

467
00:56:20,031 --> 00:56:24,711
- Jefferson? Well, why?
- Because of the conference. It's the only logical answer.

468
00:56:24,991 --> 00:56:27,991
Every drug-enforcement agency
in the hemisphere, in one room.

469
00:56:28,272 --> 00:56:31,152
Your husband breathes, the room dies.

470
00:56:36,872 --> 00:56:39,392
You gotta trust me, Audrey.

471
00:56:46,272 --> 00:56:48,592
Can you get to him?

472
00:56:48,872 --> 00:56:51,673
- What are you gonna do?
- Find the guy responsible.

473
00:56:51,872 --> 00:56:55,033
He has more of this.
For you and everybody else.

474
00:56:56,953 --> 00:56:59,152
For you now.

475
00:57:14,954 --> 00:57:15,914
We have a guest.

476
00:57:17,753 --> 00:57:20,834
- You're burning up.
- I'm OK.

477
00:57:20,993 --> 00:57:23,234
You gotta go. Go.

478
00:57:26,554 --> 00:57:27,833
Don't move!

479
00:58:11,075 --> 00:58:13,195
- Is the governor here?
- Everybody's gonna be here.

480
00:58:13,355 --> 00:58:16,435
The govenor, delegates
from all over the world.

481
00:58:16,555 --> 00:58:19,915
- Just a second. Hello.
- Jefferson, you can't go to the conference.

482
00:58:20,076 --> 00:58:23,236
- Is everything all right?
... to give him a deadly virus...

483
00:58:23,556 --> 00:58:26,516
- Audrey, I can't hear you. I'm inside.
- Now I've got it, and so do you.

484
00:58:26,716 --> 00:58:30,076
- Audrey, I can't hear you.
- Their plan is to infect everyone at the conference.

485
00:58:30,356 --> 00:58:33,036
- I'm gonna have to call you back.
- Jeff!

486
00:58:35,036 --> 00:58:38,117
Mr. Billings, are you all right?

487
00:58:38,316 --> 00:58:41,477
- I'm all right. Come on, let's go.
- You sure?

488
00:59:01,117 --> 00:59:04,117
<i>- Allô.
- You still a guest of the government?</i>

489
00:59:04,317 --> 00:59:09,078
They gave me the five-star accommodation.
Let me guess - you need my help.

490
00:59:09,477 --> 00:59:11,798
Are you near the computer?

491
00:59:11,958 --> 00:59:15,158
It's practically my pillow.
So, how do you want to start?

492
00:59:15,318 --> 00:59:21,478
- I don't know. I have nothing.
- Ah. My favorite type of investigation.

493
00:59:21,838 --> 00:59:24,638
<i>Let's see. Alors. </i>

494
00:59:25,318 --> 00:59:28,358
I'd like to take this opportunity
to introduce you to my delegates...

495
00:59:28,678 --> 00:59:32,959
Breathe. That's right,
breathe, my friend, breathe.

496
00:59:33,278 --> 00:59:36,319
Tomorrow, once these
bastards are out of the way

497
00:59:36,519 --> 00:59:41,239
and their co-operation agreements are dead and buried,
you know what the biggest problem is going to be?

498
00:59:41,518 --> 00:59:44,199
- What?
- Counting the money.

499
00:59:48,719 --> 00:59:51,199
- I can't wait for tomorrow.
- Ay-ay-ay!

500
00:59:55,439 --> 00:59:58,479
Aah. Gianni Chellini.

501
00:59:58,760 --> 01:00:03,280
Hires himself out to anyone looking to make
trouble like the Red Brigade, Shining Path.

502
01:00:05,399 --> 01:00:08,759
Someone accessed a database
on the 15th floor.

503
01:00:09,040 --> 01:00:12,880
That's Gonzalez. He's on vacation.

504
01:00:13,160 --> 01:00:17,680
Was behind the hostage-taking
of the OPEC ministers in Geneva.

505
01:00:17,960 --> 01:00:20,240
It was a nice piece of work.

506
01:00:24,561 --> 01:00:26,680
- Give me an address.
- Miami, East Highland,

507
01:00:26,880 --> 01:00:29,001
Pelican Drive, number 26900.

508
01:00:29,081 --> 01:00:31,961
- We've found the car.
- You're one great cop, Tarconi.

509
01:00:32,160 --> 01:00:35,880
Thank you for the compliment.
Now I'm going back to sleep.

510
01:00:39,241 --> 01:00:40,961
Hm. Maybe not.

511
01:00:43,281 --> 01:00:46,241
- Bumbaclaat, man! Move out the way!
- Move over.

512
01:00:46,441 --> 01:00:48,442
I'll do ya!

513
01:00:56,242 --> 01:00:58,162
Mommy.

514
01:00:59,281 --> 01:01:03,522
- Honey. You feeling better?
- A little bit.

515
01:01:03,802 --> 01:01:06,962
Why don't you try to go back to sleep, OK?

516
01:01:12,522 --> 01:01:14,723
Ma'am, are you all right?

517
01:01:24,523 --> 01:01:26,923
Jefferson. Jefferson, are you OK?

518
01:02:29,045 --> 01:02:31,165
OK, do it.

519
01:02:43,166 --> 01:02:47,006
- What are you doing?
- You know, last night got me thinking.

520
01:02:47,206 --> 01:02:49,606
How do we transport the antidote safely?

521
01:02:49,886 --> 01:02:53,126
We need something that won't break.
Something that can't be stolen.

522
01:02:53,326 --> 01:02:57,086
Something totally secure. Me.

523
01:03:02,926 --> 01:03:06,006
Impressive. Get dressed.

524
01:03:07,726 --> 01:03:08,687
Stop him.

525
01:03:11,727 --> 01:03:14,046
- These your friends?
- Not yet.

526
01:03:23,447 --> 01:03:25,927
- Where'd they go?
- The garage.

527
01:03:27,487 --> 01:03:29,207
- I'm out of ammo.
- Me too.

528
01:03:29,287 --> 01:03:31,327
- So am I.
- Where are the reloads?

529
01:03:31,487 --> 01:03:32,927
The garage.

530
01:03:34,288 --> 01:03:36,768
Check the house. Go, go, go!

531
01:03:40,608 --> 01:03:42,528
Get him! Get him!

532
01:05:31,547 --> 01:05:34,626
- What d'you want me to do?
- Keep the meter running.

533
01:05:34,907 --> 01:05:39,827
Bye. Don't worry, baby.
You're safe now. You're safe.

534
01:05:40,106 --> 01:05:43,826
You're so beautiful.
Remind me of my yellow poom-poom rider.

535
01:06:57,309 --> 01:06:59,110
Don't move.

536
01:06:59,230 --> 01:07:02,189
- Oh, Mr. Driver.
- I'll blow you into tomorrow.

537
01:07:02,390 --> 01:07:06,029
But then I'll bleed what you came for all over
the floor. You wouldn't want this, would you?

538
01:07:06,310 --> 01:07:09,750
Not after you worked so hard
trying to get to the antidote.

539
01:07:09,950 --> 01:07:12,350
Take a good look, Frank Martin.

540
01:07:12,550 --> 01:07:15,910
I'm a cure for what ails you.
I'm the only cure for what ails you.

541
01:07:16,191 --> 01:07:19,150
I am the antidote.

542
01:07:19,350 --> 01:07:22,431
But nice try. I'm impressed.
I didn't give you enough credit.

543
01:07:22,710 --> 01:07:26,550
- It took more than a driver to figure this out.
- I haven't figured it all out yet.

544
01:07:26,751 --> 01:07:29,910
Perhaps I can help you.
What part are you a little thick on?

545
01:07:30,191 --> 01:07:33,271
- You. Why?
- Oh.

546
01:07:33,471 --> 01:07:39,111
That's the easy part. It's a business deal, pure
and simple. I'm for hire to the highest bidder.

547
01:07:39,511 --> 01:07:42,751
In this case, the highest bidder
was the Colombian cocaine cartels

548
01:07:42,952 --> 01:07:46,111
that wanted these pesky lawmen
off their backs.

549
01:07:46,391 --> 01:07:49,552
You really think killing all these politicians
is going to make things easier for them?

550
01:07:49,751 --> 01:07:52,912
That's not my problem.
I was hired to do a job.

551
01:07:53,232 --> 01:07:57,511
I did the job, like you. Just my pay is better.

552
01:07:58,792 --> 01:08:01,352
My hair and my suit, too.

553
01:08:02,992 --> 01:08:05,312
Oh, Lola.

554
01:08:05,472 --> 01:08:08,752
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I have a plane to catch.

555
01:08:09,792 --> 01:08:12,032
Kill him.

556
01:08:12,192 --> 01:08:13,832
<i>Ciao, ciao. </i>

557
01:08:17,592 --> 01:08:19,873
- Don't even blink.
- What's in this for you?

558
01:08:20,072 --> 01:08:21,992
Pleasure...

559
01:08:24,392 --> 01:08:27,153
in killing you.

560
01:09:59,157 --> 01:10:01,636
We're coming to you live
from the Key Biscayne causeway

561
01:10:01,917 --> 01:10:05,757
where at least ten police cars are in
hot pursuit of a stolen red pick-up truck.

562
01:10:10,077 --> 01:10:13,037
Oh, my. This is just nuts.
Jim, are you getting that?

563
01:10:13,237 --> 01:10:17,637
There's another car that is swaying
past the police, as if they were standing still.

564
01:10:17,957 --> 01:10:21,477
- Son of a bitch can drive. Whoo.
- Yes, he can.

565
01:11:06,199 --> 01:11:08,279
We have clearance for takeoff.

566
01:11:08,399 --> 01:11:13,199
Sit back, enjoy your flight, and
we will be in Colombia before you know it.

567
01:11:55,761 --> 01:11:58,641
We have a problem with the landing gear.
I need to land.

568
01:11:58,720 --> 01:12:01,041
- Can we fly with the problem?
- Theoretically.

569
01:12:01,241 --> 01:12:04,761
Then you'll land when we get to Colombia.

570
01:12:05,081 --> 01:12:07,561
Go and see if you can lift it manually.

571
01:12:07,761 --> 01:12:11,001
Sorry for the inconvenience.
Nothing to worry about.

572
01:12:15,602 --> 01:12:18,401
Sorry, flight's been cancelled.

573
01:12:18,602 --> 01:12:21,962
I'm sorry to inform you
that you have been cancelled.

574
01:12:22,121 --> 01:12:25,001
Have a seat.

575
01:12:25,682 --> 01:12:28,202
Relax.

576
01:12:28,362 --> 01:12:31,242
Drink something.
Let's get to know each other.

577
01:12:31,362 --> 01:12:34,602
I think I know everything I need to know.

578
01:14:18,471 --> 01:14:20,391
Shit.

579
01:15:55,835 --> 01:16:00,035
Five points. What has eyes
but no ears, skin but no hair,

580
01:16:00,235 --> 01:16:02,035
it's white inside and brown outside?

581
01:16:02,236 --> 01:16:04,075
- Mom?
- A worm?

582
01:16:04,276 --> 01:16:07,715
- Wrong. Dad?
- A caterpillar.

583
01:16:07,996 --> 01:16:10,675
- Wrong.
- A potato.

584
01:16:14,596 --> 01:16:17,596
- May I help you?
- I was just leaving.

585
01:16:20,956 --> 01:16:22,876
- Coconut.
- Wrong.

586
01:16:23,036 --> 01:16:26,396
- A snake.
- Wrong.

587
01:16:26,716 --> 01:16:29,676
- A peanut.
- Yuck!

588
01:16:29,876 --> 01:16:31,956
- A hot dog.
- Wrong.

589
01:16:44,437 --> 01:16:46,557
- That was fast.
- Yeah.

590
01:16:47,797 --> 01:16:52,877
- Didn't want you to miss your plane.
- That's very thoughtful of you.

591
01:17:00,637 --> 01:17:02,838
Check it out, my man.

592
01:17:05,157 --> 01:17:08,798
You won't believe
what happened to me last night.

593
01:17:14,278 --> 01:17:17,518
I have something for you.
Since you never got to the beach.

594
01:17:17,838 --> 01:17:22,798
Oh, you know, water's water, sand is sand.
Here, there - it's all the same.

595
01:17:23,078 --> 01:17:25,118
Flight 069 to Paris.

596
01:17:25,318 --> 01:17:28,078
Thank you, Frank.
It was an interesting vacation.

597
01:17:28,279 --> 01:17:31,359
- What more could one ask for?
- Ah, yeah.

598
01:17:32,398 --> 01:17:35,959
<i>- Au revoir, Frank.
- Au revoir, my friend. Have a good flight.</i>

599
01:17:36,118 --> 01:17:38,439
I doubt it. They said it is all headwinds.

600
01:17:38,639 --> 01:17:42,279
I guess we can't have
everything we wish for, can we?

601
01:17:43,039 --> 01:17:45,239
No, we can't.

602
01:17:59,519 --> 01:18:00,680
Yeah.

603
