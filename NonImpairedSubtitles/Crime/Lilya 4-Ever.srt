Everything's here: fridge,windows,

67
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:30,076
-Why can't I Iive in my flat?
- No one can pay for it.

68
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:32,515
I can't and you can't.

69
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:34,796
- If you don't...
- No way I'm Iiving here!

70
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:38,077
If you don't want to Iive here,

00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:54,631
Don't taIk Iike that... it's stupid.

152
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:59,152
You know what?
I did think of jumping.

153
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:01,038
- ReaIIy?
-Yeah.

154
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:04,590
-Why?
- 'Cause aII of this is buIIshit.

155
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:07,194
I don't want to Iive anymore.

156
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:11,873
Yeah,you do!

157
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:15,272
Course you want to!

158
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:20,594
You saved my Iife.
Now I'm gonna save yours.

159
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:38,154
A packet of WaII Street, pIease.

160
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:47,798
27, pIease.

161
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:53,200
I'II just have the potato chips
and cigarettes.

162
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:01,952
Put the juice back where it beIongs.

163
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:08,759
Come back!

164
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:20,038
You didn't get any Ietters today.
I think your mother's forgotten you.

165
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:39,111
No, I want to sit here...

166
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:43,593
It just takes a few minutes.

167
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:48,709
Okay if they're young guys,
but if they're disgusting oId men...

168
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:52,156
On the other hand it's much quicker.
One,two and it's over!

169
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:55,835
Then you get the money
and can buy a dress or something.

170
00:23:56,840 --> 00:23:59,479
No, never. It's horribIe!

171
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,355
Let's go!

172
00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:38,949

173
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:43,113
I'm freezing! TeII me how it was.

174
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:46,431
Forget it. Let's get home, it's so coId!

175
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:06,112
-Who is it?
- Natasha.

176
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:21,878
I came to give you the money back.
I don't need it.

177
00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:24,157
Okay... Bye.

178
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:33,392

So.What's happening?

182
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:50,872
Like... my dad found the money...

183
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:54,271
And I thought it didn't make
any difference to you.

184
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:57,878
What doesn't make
any difference to me?

185
00:26:58,040 --> 00:27:02,033
You don't have any parents.
I mean, your mom's in the States.

186
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:05,875
What doesn't make
any difference to me?

187
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:10,716
Like... I toId dad
that it was your money.

188
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:15,078
-That you did what I did.
-You said that I did it?

189
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:22,472
Yeah,you know. If my dad
had known, he wouId have kiIIed me!

190
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:26,428
-You've got a screw Ioose!
-What difference does it make to you?!

191
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:30,070
-You're moving to the States...
- I thought you were my friend!

192
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:33,949
-Then you say things Iike that!

193
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:39,790
Let's go... Come on.

194
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:42,594

You fucking piece of trash,

213
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:24,634
-You won't eat anything warm today.
-What?

214
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:30,756
-The EIectricity Board cut you off.
-What?!

215
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:49,436
Damn...

216
00:30:41,320 --> 00:30:43,197
Anna!

217
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:52,596
- No one's there.Your aunt has moved.
- She's moved?

218
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:56,275
Yes. My God,you've grown.

219
00:30:56,440 --> 00:31:00,513
- I remember when you were this smaII.
-What? Where's she moved?

220
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:11,553
Open up, I know you're in there!

221
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:19,557
How are you? You happy here?

222
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:25,389
I'm an oId and sick woman.
I need a comfortabIe home.

223
00:31:25,560 --> 00:31:27,471
You understand?

224
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:35,516
- Have you spoken to mom?
- No.

225
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:43,276
- Has she written or caIIed?
- She hasn't written or caIIed.

226
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:46,432
Let me watch TV in peace...

227
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:53,598
- I don't have any money.
- Neither do I.

228
00:31:54,520 --> 00:31:58,638
They've cut off the eIectricity
and I've got nothing to eat.

229
00:31:58,800 --> 00:32:02,315
- Get a job.
- How can I, I'm in schooI?

230
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:05,631
So, do what your mother did.

231
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:11,318
Go in to town and spread your Iegs.
Now Ieave me in peace.

232
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:36,038
<i>Shut the doorl</i>

233
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:50,514
-You know what?
-What?

234
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:54,309
I read in a magazine-

235
00:32:54,480 --> 00:33:00,396
- about when different stars are born.
I'm born the same day as Britney Spears.

236
00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:05,350
- ReaIIy?
-Yeah... but four years apart.

237
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:08,478
- But you have the same birthday?
-Yeah...

238
00:33:10,040 --> 00:33:14,830
Imagine if you were mixed up in hospitaI,
then you'd be Britney Spears.

239
00:33:16,040 --> 00:33:20,238
But we're not born in the same year
and she Iives in the States.

240
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:23,278
But think how cooI it wouId have been...

241
00:33:24,040 --> 00:33:25,758
Yeah, sure...

242
00:33:28,120 --> 00:33:31,271
-You know when my birthday is?
- No.

243
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:34,193
-Today.

244
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:37,394
-You're not kidding?
- No...

245
00:33:37,560 --> 00:33:39,630
- CongratuIations!
-Thanks.

246
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:42,394
Did you get any presents?

247
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:47,953
I promise I'II get you a nice present.

248
00:33:48,120 --> 00:33:50,839
I swear... But not today.

249
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:54,231
I didn't know it was your birthday
and I've got no money.

250
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:58,149
- But you'II get a reaI present from me.
-You don't have to.

251
00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:00,470
Yeah, I'm giving you a present.

252
00:34:18,520 --> 00:34:22,433
-Are you going to schooI?
- No... and you?

253
00:34:22,680 --> 00:34:23,669
No.

254
00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:27,590
-Whatyou gonna do?
- I have to do Iaundry.

255
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:29,637
I've got no cIean cIothes.

256
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:34,275
But I don't have any washing powder.
I don't know.

257
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:39,198
Look...

261
00:34:58,200 --> 00:34:59,838
Put it away.

Did you swaIIow them?

264
00:35:06,120 --> 00:35:08,111
VoIodya, did you swaIIow them?

265
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:13,834
What is it?

266
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:18,633
What is it? VoIodya!

-The submarine base.

WeII,when they throw me
out of the house.

289
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:39,553
My dad worked here.
He was in the army.

290
00:37:39,720 --> 00:37:42,188
My mom aIso worked here.

- My mom worked in this kitchen.
-Your mother cooked food?

292
00:37:58,040 --> 00:38:00,110
And your dad?

293
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:04,432
He was in the army
and came here for a IittIe whiIe...

294
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:07,720
He probabIy just wanted
to sIeep with my mom.

295
00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:11,919
Then she got pregnant
and he moved to Moscow.

296
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:16,679
She wrote to him, but he didn't answer.
I've never seen him.

00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:11,797
See, I've got gIue.

304
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:14,079
Take it.

305
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:18,915
I'm freezing...

306
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:24,556
We can buiId a hut.

307
00:40:30,680 --> 00:40:33,114
What hut?

308
00:40:34,080 --> 00:40:37,038
To get warm.

309
00:41:01,160 --> 00:41:03,549
It's warmer, isn't it?

310
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,230
It's Iike Iying in a coffin.

311
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:10,112
Let's pretend we're dead.

312
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:13,635
No,thanks...

313
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:17,196
What do you think happens
when someone dies?

314
00:41:17,360 --> 00:41:22,229
Does he go to paradise,
to God and Jesus and aII of that?

315
00:41:24,320 --> 00:41:26,470
I don't know...

316
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:32,477
I beIieve that.
I think you become an angeI in heaven.

317
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:39,470
You can pIay basketbaII aII day Iong
and score as many points as you Iike.

318
00:41:39,640 --> 00:41:43,189
And be a miIIion times better
than MichaeI Jordan.

319
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:47,314
That's buIIshit...

320
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:51,149
That's not the onIy thing
you can do there.

321
00:41:51,320 --> 00:41:53,550
You can do what you Iike in paradise.

322
00:41:53,720 --> 00:41:58,077
Dance, pIay computer games,
go to parties...

323
00:41:58,240 --> 00:42:02,677
That's stupid. I'm not going to die,
I'm going to America.

324
00:42:03,480 --> 00:42:06,313
I'd pIay basketbaII.

325
00:42:10,280 --> 00:42:13,317
- Cut it out.
-What are you doing?

326
00:42:17,320 --> 00:42:19,117
- I feeI sick...
-Where you going?

327
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:20,395
Stop it...

328
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:25,829
I don't want to be here anymore.
I'm tired of this...

329
00:42:43,120 --> 00:42:45,509
SUMMONS TO SOCIAL WELFARE

330
00:42:45,840 --> 00:42:50,516
So you've had no contact with your
mother since she moved to America?

331
00:42:50,680 --> 00:42:54,195
- No.
-And she hasn't caIIed?

332
00:42:55,480 --> 00:42:57,516
I don't have a teIephone.

333
00:42:57,680 --> 00:43:00,877
- She hasn't written?
- No.

334
00:43:02,240 --> 00:43:06,711
We've received a Ietter from her.
Do you know anything about this?

335
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:08,916
No.Why?

336
00:43:09,080 --> 00:43:11,355
In the Ietter she writes...

337
00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:15,639
Of course it's not IegaIIy binding.

338
00:43:15,800 --> 00:43:18,189
You can't formaIIy do this...

339
00:43:18,360 --> 00:43:22,717
But she writes
that she renounces her parenthood.

340
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:29,596
This means that she no Ionger wishes
to be your guardian.

341
00:43:30,600 --> 00:43:32,875
Guardian? What are you taIking about?

342
00:43:33,040 --> 00:43:38,239
Look, I reaIIy feeI sorry for you,
but here she writes...

343
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:39,628
I can read it to you.

344
00:43:39,800 --> 00:43:42,519
''LiIya has aIways been
an unwanted chiId''-

345
00:43:42,680 --> 00:43:46,832
-''and therefore
I no Ionger wish to be her guardian.''

346
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:50,276
''I here by hand her over
to the care of the SociaI Services.''

347
00:43:50,600 --> 00:43:53,114
It's awfuI, I understand...

348
00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:55,271
It's awfuI.

349
00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:08,789
And cigarettes, pIease.

350
00:47:10,240 --> 00:47:11,992
That'II be 160,40.

351
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:21,192
Thanks.

352
00:47:22,360 --> 00:47:24,999
- CIose your eyes.
-What?

353
00:47:25,320 --> 00:47:26,309
CIose your eyes.

354
00:47:28,640 --> 00:47:31,234
-What for?
- PIease, cIose your eyes.

355
00:47:31,320 --> 00:47:34,756
-What you going to do?
- Nothing speciaI, just do it.

356
00:47:36,880 --> 00:47:40,668
What you going to do?
Are you going to hit me?

357
00:47:41,160 --> 00:47:44,311
- Don't be siIIy. Just cIose your eyes.
-You promise?

358
00:47:45,240 --> 00:47:47,117
LiIya,where you going?

359
00:47:49,840 --> 00:47:53,071
Keep them cIosed... Now you can Iook.

360
00:47:53,800 --> 00:47:57,952
-There you are. For your birthday.
- Is it reaIIy for me?

361
00:47:58,760 --> 00:48:02,878
-Take it!
- ReaIIy? You're kidding...

362
00:48:03,040 --> 00:48:05,031
-You're jerking me around...
- No.

363
00:48:05,360 --> 00:48:09,148
- It's mine? You're sure? Mine? Yeah?
-Yeah...

364
00:48:14,400 --> 00:48:18,029
-Thanks...
- I promised you.

365
00:48:18,600 --> 00:48:21,637
I never got anything as nice.

366
00:48:35,840 --> 00:48:39,674
-Where'd you get the money?
- I found it on the street.

367
00:48:39,840 --> 00:48:43,833
- No... reaIIy?
- Doesn't matter. Mom sent money.

368
00:48:45,920 --> 00:48:48,798
It's mine! Mine!

369
00:48:55,640 --> 00:48:58,234
Try to take it if you can.

370
00:50:32,200 --> 00:50:34,350
HeIIo.

371
00:50:35,800 --> 00:50:38,712
- How you doing?
- Go to heII!

372
00:50:39,640 --> 00:50:41,596
What happened?

373
00:50:46,440 --> 00:50:50,035
You're freezing, it's coId...

374
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:55,073
-Where do you Iive? You want a Iift?
- Go away!

375
00:50:55,600 --> 00:50:58,876
Don't be afraid, I won't touch you.
I'II just take you home.

376
00:50:59,120 --> 00:51:02,430
You can't waIk around here at night,
it's a dangerous area.

377
00:51:03,560 --> 00:51:06,393
Don't be afraid, I won't touch you.

378
00:51:06,680 --> 00:51:08,750
I'm just a normaI guy.

379
00:51:29,200 --> 00:51:31,873
By the way, my name's Andrei.

380
00:51:32,720 --> 00:51:34,711
I'm LiIya.

381
00:51:35,520 --> 00:51:38,034
PIeased to meet you.

382
00:51:42,600 --> 00:51:45,672
- HeIp yourseIf.
-Thanks.

383
00:51:59,320 --> 00:52:03,438
What were you doing so Iate
in such a dangerous neighbourhood?

384
00:52:03,960 --> 00:52:06,599
- Doesn't matter...
- Okay, doesn't matter.

385
00:52:08,600 --> 00:52:12,275
- How oId are you?
- 16.

386
00:52:12,440 --> 00:52:16,069
Then you're a big girI,
but it's stiII dangerous.

387
00:52:16,240 --> 00:52:18,549
I'd advise you not to waIk there.

388
00:52:26,080 --> 00:52:28,992
WeII...
you going to get into my bed now?.

389
00:52:29,160 --> 00:52:32,675
What are you on about?
I'm not going to sIeep with you.

390
00:52:34,480 --> 00:52:37,074
Why'd you give me a Iift?

391
00:52:37,240 --> 00:52:39,913
- I just did.
-You think I'm stupid?

392
00:52:40,080 --> 00:52:43,072
No, I don't. I just wanted to be nice.

393
00:52:43,880 --> 00:52:46,553
I saw you and just wanted to heIp.

394
00:52:46,720 --> 00:52:49,553
So you think I'm ugIy?

395
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:52,992
I don't think you're ugIy...

396
00:52:53,160 --> 00:52:55,515
You're reaIIy pretty.

397
00:52:56,680 --> 00:52:59,831
But I'm not going to sIeep with you.

398
00:53:01,760 --> 00:53:04,035
That wasn't why I...

399
00:53:06,240 --> 00:53:09,915
Okay. Sorry...Thanks for the Iift.

400
00:53:13,040 --> 00:53:14,268
Take care...

401
00:53:22,440 --> 00:53:23,634
Wait!

402
00:53:24,800 --> 00:53:26,199
Wait...

403
00:53:31,600 --> 00:53:35,388
I thought maybe...
maybe we couId meet sometime?

404
00:53:36,160 --> 00:53:39,118
Just meet...

405
00:53:39,280 --> 00:53:43,239
We couId go somewhere... see a movie...
I don't know. But no funny stuff.

406
00:53:43,760 --> 00:53:45,352
No funny stuff?.

407
00:53:45,560 --> 00:53:49,678
ExactIy...
Just don't get any ideas.

408
00:53:55,040 --> 00:53:56,189
Okay.

409
00:53:56,480 --> 00:53:59,438
Great. CooI...

410
00:54:08,280 --> 00:54:10,032
Hi.

411
00:54:10,480 --> 00:54:13,836
What are you doing here?
HeII,you scared me!

412
00:54:15,080 --> 00:54:17,116
- Sorry.
-What are you doing here?

413
00:54:18,040 --> 00:54:19,996
Sorry, I scared you.

414
00:54:21,160 --> 00:54:25,358
CouId I... sIeep over at your pIace?

415
00:54:26,040 --> 00:54:27,871
Okay.

416
00:54:28,360 --> 00:54:30,920
Sorry, I didn't mean to scare you.

417
00:54:34,160 --> 00:54:38,039
He just wants to sIeep with you.

418
00:54:38,200 --> 00:54:40,475
No he doesn't.

419
00:54:40,640 --> 00:54:43,632
Course he wants to.

420
00:54:43,800 --> 00:54:47,349
No he doesn't. He's nice.

421
00:54:47,560 --> 00:54:49,790
Don't beIieve it.

422
00:54:50,960 --> 00:54:54,270
-You're just jeaIous.
- Not at aII.

423
00:54:54,440 --> 00:54:57,318
- Course you are.
- Not at aII.

424
00:54:58,480 --> 00:55:01,916
- But of course you are.
- No, I'm not.

425
00:55:06,400 --> 00:55:09,517
He just wants to sIeep with you.

426
00:55:17,600 --> 00:55:20,558
He just wants to sIeep with you.

427
00:55:28,560 --> 00:55:29,595
Mom!

428
00:55:35,800 --> 00:55:36,789
No!

429
00:55:37,800 --> 00:55:38,915
Shit!

430
00:55:41,480 --> 00:55:42,515
Shit!

431
00:56:42,480 --> 00:56:45,631
-You want some more?
-Yes.

432
00:56:45,800 --> 00:56:48,155
- Pie or ice-cream?
- Ice-cream.

433
00:56:48,320 --> 00:56:51,357
Ice-cream? I'II get it.

434
00:57:01,760 --> 00:57:03,796
-There you go.
-Thanks.

435
00:57:17,840 --> 00:57:20,832
TotaI fucking shit!

436
00:57:24,320 --> 00:57:27,437
Now I can understand
why my mother Ieft.

437
00:57:28,280 --> 00:57:30,714
There's nothing to do here.

438
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:42,470
- Let's go to Sweden.
-What?

439
00:57:42,640 --> 00:57:46,952
We take our things and go... now!
Don't you beIieve me?

440
00:57:48,320 --> 00:57:52,279
-You're kidding.
- Of course I am. Not now. In a week.

441
00:57:53,120 --> 00:57:57,750
I Iive in Sweden, I work there.
I'm onIy here on hoIiday.

442
00:57:58,120 --> 00:58:01,476
I Ieave in a week.
You can come with me.

443
00:58:03,720 --> 00:58:07,474
I can get a job and a flat
for you there.

444
00:58:07,640 --> 00:58:12,031
It'd be cooI... Haven't you ever
thought of Ieaving here?

445
00:58:12,320 --> 00:58:16,029
This country is shit.
There's nothing to do here.

446
00:58:16,880 --> 00:58:21,874
Sweden is a paradise compared
to here.You can reaIIy reIax there.

447
00:58:22,320 --> 00:58:25,198
And the peopIe...
Even the peopIe are different.

448
00:58:26,160 --> 00:58:29,118
They're kind, not Iike here.

449
00:58:30,120 --> 00:58:33,351
Besides,you can earn
reaIIy good money.

450
00:58:33,800 --> 00:58:38,476
You know, in one month you can earn
what a doctor makes here in a year.

451
00:58:38,880 --> 00:58:42,714
-That can't be true!
-Yes it is, reaIIy!

452
00:58:42,880 --> 00:58:46,714
Look at it here... PeopIe are crazy!

453
00:58:46,880 --> 00:58:49,519
You know what my cousin did?

454
00:58:50,880 --> 00:58:54,236
He soId one of his kidneys
because he didn't have money.

455
00:58:55,360 --> 00:58:57,954
WouId you seII a kidney?

456
00:58:59,960 --> 00:59:02,918
You don't deserve a Iife Iike that.

457
00:59:14,160 --> 00:59:18,039

498
01:03:43,520 --> 01:03:47,195
Picking? In winter?
VegetabIes don't growin winter.

499
01:03:47,360 --> 01:03:49,715
So?
Maybe it's warmer in Sweden.

500
01:03:49,880 --> 01:03:53,270
-You know where Sweden is?

-Why?
-There couId be probIems at the border.

515
01:05:06,480 --> 01:05:08,869
You're not 18 yet.

516
01:05:09,480 --> 01:05:12,517
It's so they won't ask
unneccessary questions.

517
01:05:15,040 --> 01:05:18,350
By the way, I rang my boss.

He said you couId start on Monday.

519

It's for my friend,
a friend that means a Iot to me.

525
01:05:54,640 --> 01:05:56,756
I don't want him to be here aIone.

I'II ask... I'II Iook into it...

527
01:06:01,680 --> 01:06:04,831

01:06:05,240 --> 01:06:07,595

Sorry, but I'm not sure

...there's a mist. It's so coId.

01:29:36,520 --> 01:29:40,559
I don't want this Iife.
I'm not interested.

599
01:29:42,800 --> 01:29:44,153
