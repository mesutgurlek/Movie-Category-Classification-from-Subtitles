1
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:35,630
<i>She shivers in the wind
like the last leaf on a dying tree. </i>

2
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:42,160
<i>l let her hear my footsteps</i>

3
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:47,080
<i>She only goes stiff for a moment</i>

4
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:49,800
Care for a smoke?

5
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,600
Sure
l'll take one

6
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:58,120
Are you as bored by that crowd as l am?

7
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:03,280
l didn't come here for the party
l came here for you

8
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:07,800
l've watched you for days

9
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:12,350
You're everything a man could ever want

10
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:14,670
lt's not just your face,

11
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:19,280
your figure, or your voice

12
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:24,110
lt's your eyes

13
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:28,600
All the things l see in your eyes

14
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:33,040
What is it you see in my eyes?

15
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:40,000
l see a crazy calm

16
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:43,520
You're sick of running

17
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:48,680
You're ready to face what you have to face

18
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:52,440
But you don't want to face it alone

19
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:54,480
No

20
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:56,760
l don't want to face it alone

21
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:06,920
The wind rises electric

22
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,470
<i>She's soft and warm
and almost weightless</i>

23
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:14,400
<i>Her perfume a sweet promise
that brings tears to my eyes</i>

24
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:18,280
<i>l tell her that everything will be all right</i>

25
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,870
<i>That l'll save her from whatever
she's scared of and take her far, far away</i>

26
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:30,840
<i>l tell her l love her. </i>

27
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:37,440
<i>The silencer</i>
<i>makes a whisper of the gunshot. </i>

28
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:42,120
<i>I hold her close until she's gone. </i>

29
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:47,520
<i>I'll never know</i>
<i>what she was running from. </i>

30
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:51,600
<i>I'll cash her check in the morning. </i>

31
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:44,680
<i> Just one hour to go. </i>
<i>My last day on the job. </i>

32
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:47,600
<i>Early retirement. </i>
<i>Not my idea. </i>

33
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:50,560
<i>Doctor's orders. </i>
<i>Heart condition. </i>

34
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:53,360
<i>"Angina" he calls it. </i>

35
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:57,390
<i>I'm polishing my badge and getting myself</i>
<i>used to the idea of saying goodbye to it. </i>

36
00:04:57,480 --> 00:05:01,110
<i>It. And the 30-odd years</i>
<i>of protecting and serving and tears</i>

37
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:05,560
<i>and the blood and terror</i>
<i>and triumph it represents. </i>

38
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:08,640
<i>I'm thinking about Eileen's slow smile. </i>

39
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:13,270
<i>About the thick, fat steaks</i>
<i>she picked up at the butcher's today. </i>

40
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:16,510
<i>And I'm thinking about</i>
<i>the one loose end I haven't tied up. </i>

41
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:21,360
<i>A young girl who's out there somewhere. </i>
<i>Helpless in the hands of a drooling lunatic. </i>

42
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:30,080
Damn it, Hartigan, l won't let you do this
You're gonna get yourself killed

43
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:33,390
You're gonna get us both killed
l won't let you. l'm warnin' you.

44
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:35,310
Let go of my coat, Bob

45
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:37,310
You're draggin' me down with you

46
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:40,550
l'm your partner
They can kill me, too

47
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:43,950
l ain't puttin' up with that. l'm gettin'
on the horn and calling for backup

48
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:46,400
Sure, Bob
We'll just wait

49
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:50,240
Sit on our hands while that Roark brat gets
his sick thrills with victim number four

50
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:52,390
Victim number four

51
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:54,790
Nancy Callahan, age 11

52
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:57,110
And she'll be raped
and slashed to ribbons

53
00:05:57,560 --> 00:06:00,920
And that backup that we're waitin' on
will just so happen to show up

54
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:05,360
just late enough for Roark
to get back to his US Senator daddy

55
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:07,910
Take a deep breath, Hartigan

56
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,910
Settle down and think straight

57
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:14,640
You're pushin' 60
and you got a bum ticker

58
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:16,630
You ain't savin' anyone

59
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:20,310
You got a great attitude, Bob

60
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:23,600
Real credit to the force, you are

61
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:27,280
Eileen's at home waitin' for you
Think about Eileen

62
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:31,950
Heck, Bob,

63
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:35,840
maybe you are right

64
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:38,960
l'm glad to hear you're finally talkin' sense

65
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,680
<i>Hell of a way to end a partnership. </i>

66
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:45,320
<i>Hell of a way to start my retirement. </i>

67
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:48,040
<i>Nancy Callahan. Age 11. </i>

68
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:50,430
<i>For all I know. She's dead already. </i>

69
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:55,190
You've been a very good girl, Nancy

70
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:57,640
You've been very quiet

71
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:59,870
Don't be scared

72
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:01,870
We're gonna be
taking you home really soon

73
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:06,790
But first,
we're going to introduce you to somebody

74
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:10,080
He's a very nice man

75
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:15,080
<i>Halfway to the warehouse where</i>
<i>Weevil said they took her. And it hits. </i>

76
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:17,550
<i>Wicked spot of indigestion. </i>

77
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:20,000
<i>At least that's what I pray it is. </i>

78
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:22,200
..light-hearted
and momentary digression

79
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:25,040
The briefest indulge-ment
in automotive pleasure

80
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:29,080
For cheap thrills
Such short-lived durability, Mr. Shlubb

81
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:33,470
You would risk engender-ating ill will
on the part of our employers

82
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:35,440
<i>Burt Shlubb and Douglas Klump -</i>

83
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:39,640
<i>two any-dirty-job-there-is thugs</i>
<i>with delusions of eloquence. </i>

84
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:42,550
This Jaguar you so pinheadedly covet -

85
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:45,110
temporarily remanded
to our custody though it may be -

86
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:48,350
remains the property
of the son of Senator Roark

87
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:51,590
<i>Gotta keep this quiet. </i>
<i>Take 'em down fast. </i>

88
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,640
A single dent,
the merest scratch thereupon,

89
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:56,600
and the before-mentioned consequences
of which l so recently made mention

90
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:59,040
shall surely be athwart us

91
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:11,950
<i>Catch your breath. </i>
<i>Give your heart time to slow down. </i>

92
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:13,920
<i>But it won't slow down. </i>

93
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:17,870
<i>Get over it. </i>

94
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:20,110
<i>She needs you. </i>

95
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:21,790
We're all done here, Benny

96
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:25,350
Let's give them some time together
Give them some privacy

97
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:27,190
Be with you in a minute, Lenny

98
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:29,400
l'm just making sure
they get along really well

99
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:34,950
And what kind of beast couldn't get along
with a precious little girl like this?

100
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:38,110
You must be awfully scared now

101
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:41,560
But you've got nothing to be scared of

102
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:45,270
All we're gonna do is have a nice little talk

103
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:50,960
That's all. Just a nice talk
Just you and me

104
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:54,240
Don't you cry now

105
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:56,310
<i>Doctor said it'd be like this. </i>

106
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:58,710
<i>Just take the pill he gave you. </i>

107
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:09,280
<i>No need to play it quiet. </i>

108
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:11,320
<i>Not anymore. </i>

109
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:16,200
<i>Breathe steady. Old man. </i>
<i>Prove you're not completely useless. </i>

110
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:18,840
<i>What the hell?</i>
<i>Go out with a bang. </i>

111
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:21,030
<i>He likes to hear 'em scream. </i>

112
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:23,510
<i>I've seen his victims</i>
<i>and their twisted little faces. </i>

113
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:28,230
<i>All wide-mouthed and bug-eyed. Frozen</i>
<i>in their last horrible moment of living. </i>

114
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:32,710
<i>No screams. </i>
<i>Either I'm just in time. Or I'm way too late. </i>

115
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:46,920
<i>It's nothing. Barely a flesh wound. </i>
<i>On your feet. Old man. </i>

116
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:55,400
Roark
Give it up

117
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:57,550
Let the girl go

118
00:09:57,640 --> 00:09:59,760
You can't do
a goddamn thing to me, Hartigan

119
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:01,800
You know who l am

120
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:04,080
You know who my father is

121
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:06,470
You can't touch me, you piece-of-shit cop

122
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:11,150
Look at you. You can't even lift
that cannon you're carrying

123
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:14,200
Sure, l can

124
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:24,240
Cover your eyes, Nancy
l don't want you watching this

125
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:27,190
l mean it, baby
Cover your eyes right now

126
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:31,280
<i>I take his weapons away. </i>

127
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:35,680
<i>Both of them. </i>

128
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:47,640
<i>Hell of a way to end a partnership. </i>

129
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:50,520
For God's sakes,
don't make it any worse

130
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:54,950
- Don't make me kill you
- Doin' fine, Bob

131
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:57,240
Never better

132
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:01,360
l'm ready to kick your ass

133
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:04,160
<i>Keep him talking, </i>
<i>buy time. </i>

134
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:06,710
<i>Just a few more minutes. </i>
<i>Just till the backup gets here. </i>

135
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:10,560
Sit down and stay down
l'll kill you if l have to

136
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:14,350
<i>Keep his mind off the girl -</i>
<i>skinny little Nancy</i>

137
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:16,080
<i>He can't kill her</i>
<i>once the backup gets here. </i>

138
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:18,720
Run home, Nancy.
Run for your life.

139
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:21,520
Hey. Don't listen to him
he's a crazy man.

140
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:24,640
- What a tough man you are, huh?
- You stay right where you're at

141
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:27,520
You shoot your partner in the back..

142
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:29,670
then you try to scare a little girl

143
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:34,120
Maybe l'll pull my spare rod, plug you
a couple of times, show you how it's done

144
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:36,080
We could've worked something out,
but you've blown that

145
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:39,070
Sit down or l'll blast you in half

146
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:42,560
- You're so slow, you'll never stop me
- Sit down

147
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:45,230
You'll never be able to stop me

148
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:56,750
<i>I finally sit down. </i>
<i>Just like you told me to. </i>

149
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:00,390
<i>The sirens are close now. </i>

150
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:03,670
<i>She'll be safe. </i>

151
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:15,600
<i>Things go dark. </i>
<i>I don't mind much. </i>

152
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:20,040
<i>Getting sleepy. </i>
<i>It's OK. </i>

153
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:22,160
<i>She'll be safe. </i>

154
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:24,630
<i>An old man dies,. </i>

155
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:27,110
<i>A little girl lives. </i>

156
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:29,320
<i>Fair trade. </i>

157
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:36,350
<i> The night is hot as hell. </i>

158
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:39,480
<i>It's a lousy room</i>
<i>in a lousy part of a lousy town. </i>

159
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:43,120
<i>I'm staring at a goddess. </i>

160
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:45,400
<i>She's telling me she wants me. </i>

161
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:49,110
<i>I'm not gonna waste one more second</i>
<i>wondering how I've gotten so lucky. </i>

162
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:50,870
I want you.

163
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:56,120
<i>She smells like angels ought to smell. </i>

164
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:01,640
<i>The perfect woman. </i>

165
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,230
<i>The goddess. </i>

166
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:13,510
l need you

167
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:17,790
<i>Goldie. </i>

168
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:20,080
<i>She says her name is Goldie. </i>

169
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:31,230
<i>Three hours later and my head</i>
<i>is feeling several sizes too big. </i>

170
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:34,120
<i>And that cold thing</i>
<i>happens to my stomach. </i>

171
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:38,160
<i>And I realize Goldie's dead. </i>
<i>Not a mark on her. </i>

172
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:41,520
<i>You'd have to check her pulse</i>
<i>or notice those perfect breasts of hers</i>

173
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:44,200
<i>aren't moving like they would</i>
<i>if she was breathing. </i>

174
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:47,000
<i>She was murdered</i>
<i>and I was right here when it happened. </i>

175
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:51,390
<i>Lying next to her. </i>
<i>Stone drunk. Just like she was. </i>

176
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:55,600
<i>Damn it, Goldie. Who were you</i>
<i>and who wanted you dead?</i>

177
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:58,070
<i>Who were you</i>
<i>besides an angel of mercyy, </i>

178
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:01,200
<i>giving a two-time loser like me</i>
<i>the night of his life?</i>

179
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:03,960
<i>It sure as hell wasn't my looks. </i>

180
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:06,800
<i>So why the sleazy saloon?</i>

181
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:09,240
<i>Why the kindness, Goldie?</i>

182
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:14,630
<i>The cops - they're telling me too much. </i>

183
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:16,520
<i>Showing up before anybody</i>
<i>but me and the killer</i>

184
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:18,800
<i>could know there's been a murder. </i>

185
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:22,160
<i>Somebody paid good money</i>
<i>for this frame. </i>

186
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:24,920
<i>No reason at all to play it quiet. </i>

187
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:28,040
<i>No reason to play it any way but my way. </i>

188
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:35,390
<i>Whoever killed you is gonna pay, Goldie. </i>

189
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,150
Open up, police!

190
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:43,880
l'll be right out

191
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:14,350
<i>I don't know why you died, Goldie. </i>

192
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:21,270
<i>I don't know why and I don't know how</i>
<i>I never even met you before tonight. </i>

193
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:24,990
<i>But you were a friend and more</i>
<i>when I needed one. </i>

194
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:27,600
<i>And when I find out who did it. </i>

195
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:30,670
<i>It won't be quick and quiet</i>
<i>like it was with you. </i>

196
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:34,230
<i>It'll be loud and nasty - my kind of kill. </i>

197
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:37,160
<i>And when his eyes go dead. </i>
<i>the hell I send him to</i>

198
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:40,790
<i>will seem like heaven</i>
<i>after what I've done to him. </i>

199
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:42,110
<i>I love you, Goldie. </i>

200
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:05,480
Claire?

201
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:18,160
Now, don't worry Lucille,
l was just grazed

202
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:23,030
- You got any beers around this place?
- No way am l giving you any alcohol

203
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:27,120
Besides, it's not what
you came here for anyway, is it?

204
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:28,760
No

205
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:31,400
Go ahead
You're worse without 'em

206
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:33,550
Thanks
You're the best

207
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:36,190
<i>Lucille's my parole officer. </i>

208
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:38,240
<i>She's a dyke, but God knows why. </i>

209
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:41,790
<i>With that body of hers</i>
<i>she could have any man she wants. </i>

210
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:44,870
<i>The pills come from a girlfriend</i>
<i>who's a shrink. </i>

211
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:48,560
<i>She tried to analyze me once</i>
<i>but she got too scared. </i>

212
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:52,510
Haven't seen you like this in a while

213
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:55,830
- Got in a fight with some cops
- Didn't happen to kill any of them, did ya?

214
00:16:55,920 --> 00:17:00,390
Not that l know of. But they know they've
been in a fight, that's for damn sure

215
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:03,080
How the hell do you suppose
l'm gonna square this with the board?

216
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:06,070
There ain't no squaring it
Not this time

217
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:08,630
This isn't some barroom brawl

218
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:11,840
Or some creep with a gas can
trying to torch someone

219
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:13,360
Hey, hey
this is big

220
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:17,070
- Settle down, Marv. Take another pill
- Hey, there ain't no settlin' down

221
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:20,040
This is blood for blood, and by the gallons

222
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:24,350
This is the old days and the bad days,
the all-or-nothing days

223
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:27,430
They're back
There's no choices left

224
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:29,190
And l'm ready for war

225
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:31,800
Prison was hell for you, Marv
lt's gonna be life this time

226
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:37,120
Hell's waking up every goddamn day
and not even knowing why you're here

227
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:40,160
But l'm out now

228
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:43,520
lt took somebody who was kind to me
getting killed to do it

229
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:47,520
But l'm out
l know exactly what l gotta do

230
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:54,000
<i>So you were scared. </i>
<i>Weren't you Goldie?</i>

231
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:56,760
<i>Somebody wanted you dead</i>
<i>and you knew it. </i>

232
00:17:56,840 --> 00:17:59,440
<i>So you hit the saloons. The bad places</i>

233
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:03,670
looking for the biggest,
meanest lug around and finding me

234
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:06,280
<i>Well. I'm gonna find</i>
<i>that son of a bitch that killed you. </i>

235
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:09,120
<i>And I'm gonna give him the hard goodbye. </i>

236
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:13,200
<i>Walk down</i>
<i>the right back alley in Sin City... </i>

237
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:16,430
- Leave your hands off Nancy.
<i>... and you could find anything. </i>

238
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:19,040
That coat looks like Baghdad

239
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:22,640
So does your face
Take off!

240
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:30,120
He's new here, Marv
He didn't know

241
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:32,430
<i>Kadie's is my kind of joint. </i>

242
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:39,390
<i>Nancy's just getting started with her gig, </i>
<i>but already the crowd's breathing hard. </i>

243
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:41,600
<i>Plenty of nights I've drooled over Nancy. </i>

244
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:45,230
<i>Shoulder to shoulder</i>
<i>with all the other losers like me. </i>

245
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:48,710
<i>But that's not what I'm lookin' for tonight. </i>

246
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:51,000
What'll it be, Marv?

247
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:53,840
A shot and a brew, Shellie,
and keep 'em comin'

248
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:57,360
Sure, honey
You take it slow, now

249
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:14,550
<i> Most people think Marv is crazy. </i>

250
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:18,160
<i>He just had the rotten luck</i>
<i>of being born in the wrong century. </i>

251
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:20,440
<i>He'd be right at home</i>
<i>on some ancient battlefield. </i>

252
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:22,910
<i>Swinging an axe into somebody's face. </i>

253
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:27,710
<i>Or in a Roman arena</i>
<i>taking a sword to other gladiators like him. </i>

254
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:31,510
<i>They'd have tossed him girls</i>
<i>like Nancy back then. </i>

255
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:36,760
Show's over, dickwad
Drink up

256
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:39,600
Now, that's one fine-looking coat
you're wearing there

257
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:47,110
Your killin' days are over,
you over-the-hill, do-gooder son of a bitch

258
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:51,990
l love hit men. No matter what
you do to them, you don't feel bad

259
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:01,830
- Take it off
- What?

260
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:04,360
Fine coat like that
and you're bleeding all over it.

261
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:06,720
All right, it's all yours
Oh, God!

262
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:10,240
lt wasn't you losers who killed Goldie

263
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:14,710
The guy who did that,
he knew what he was doing

264
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:17,960
So tell me, man,
who sent you?

265
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:23,000
l don't hear you giving me any names

266
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:26,630
So l guess when l shot you in the belly
l aimed a little too high

267
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:34,000
You keep holding out on me like this,
and l'm gonna have to get really nasty

268
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:42,230
lt was Telly..
Telly Stern passed me the order

269
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:46,080
He runs the tables over
to the Triple Ace Club

270
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:49,480
Thanks again

271
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:56,160
<i>Then the damnedest thing happens. </i>

272
00:20:56,240 --> 00:21:00,240
<i>For a second. I smell the angel smell</i>
<i>that belonged to my Goldie. </i>

273
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:02,790
<i>Just need my medicine. Is all. </i>

274
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:04,950
Bastard

275
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:08,000
You're gonna pay for what you did to me

276
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:12,470
Feel like talking, Louie?

277
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:14,840
How many got paid off
for the frame, Louie?

278
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:16,560
How many for the kill?

279
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:19,280
lt was Connelly
He set me up

280
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:23,600
He'll never talk

281
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:29,560
l don't know about you,
but l'm havin' a ball

282
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:34,560
<i>Connelly talks. </i>
<i>They all talk. </i>

283
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:37,470
And what have been
your sins, my son?

284
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:40,120
Well, Padre,
l don't want to keep you up all night,

285
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:43,160
so l'll just fill you in on the latest batch

286
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:46,120
These here hands of mine,
they got blood all over 'em

287
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:48,080
You're speaking figuratively

288
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:52,680
When l need to find something out,
l just go out and look for somebody

289
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:55,040
that knows more than me,
and l go and l ask them

290
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:58,240
Sometimes, l ask pretty hard

291
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:04,000
By way of a ''for instance'',
l killed three men tonight

292
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:05,310
Tortured 'em first

293
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:09,630
You might say l been
working my way up the food chain

294
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:12,360
First two were minnows -
small-time messengers

295
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:17,070
But it was Connelly, the money man,
who fingered you, Padre

296
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:19,720
Dear Lord, man,
this is a house of God

297
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:23,560
Just give me a damn name

298
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:26,710
- Roark
- You really are pushing your luck, Padre,

299
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:29,560
feeding me garbage like that

300
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:30,870
lt can't be that big

301
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:33,030
There's a farm
at North Cross and Lennox

302
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:35,920
lt's all there
Find out for yourself

303
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,880
And while you're at it,

304
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:43,160
ask yourself if that corpse of a slut
is worth dying for

305
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:45,640
<i>Worth dying for. </i>

306
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:47,470
<i>Worth killing for. </i>

307
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:49,920
<i>Worth going to hell for. </i>

308
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,830
Amen

309
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:58,080
<i>His keys say the padre drove a Mercedes. </i>

310
00:22:58,160 --> 00:23:01,470
<i>Or at least that's what they're</i>
<i>passing off as a Mercedes these days. </i>

311
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:05,600
<i>Modern cars -</i>
<i>they all look like electric shavers. </i>

312
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:13,560
Goldie

313
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:29,720
lt couldn't be Goldie

314
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:33,800
<i>It's my own fault and nobody else's. </i>
<i>that I got confused. </i>

315
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:37,430
<i>I've been having so much fun</i>
<i>I forgot to take my medicine. </i>

316
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:39,350
<i>That wasn't Goldie back there. </i>

317
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:40,880
<i>Goldie's dead. </i>

318
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:44,750
<i>And that's the whole reason</i>
<i>that I've been doing what I've been doing. </i>

319
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:48,440
<i>When you got a condition. </i>
<i>It's bad to forget your medicine. </i>

320
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:56,480
<i>The cold thing- It creeps into my gut</i>
<i>and tells me one more time it won't let go. </i>

321
00:23:57,160 --> 00:23:59,720
<i>This is a bad place this farm. </i>

322
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:01,390
<i>People have died here... </i>

323
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:04,840
<i>...the wrong way. </i>

324
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:09,270
l don't want to fight, pooch

325
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:14,800
l got no gripe with you

326
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:18,870
Easy, boy

327
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:24,560
<i>No way I was gonna use</i>
<i>my gun on you, Buddy. </i>

328
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:27,200
<i>It's whoever owns you I'm curious about. </i>

329
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:31,200
<i>Because there's blood on your breath, </i>
<i>and I think I know what kind. </i>

330
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:34,040
<i>So I sniff around to see what's buried. </i>

331
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:39,040
Here we go

332
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:47,190
<i>It's impossible. </i>
<i>Nobody can sneak up on me. </i>

333
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:57,230
<i>I go blind. </i>
<i>Not a sound. Nobody's that quiet. </i>

334
00:24:57,320 --> 00:25:00,920
<i>Nobody except the one who snuck</i>
<i>into that hotel room two nights ago. </i>

335
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:04,800
lt was you, you bastard
You killed her

336
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:07,190
You killed Goldie

337
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:08,800
lt was..

338
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:11,840
<i>I blew it, Goldie. </i>

339
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:14,920
<i>I found your killer, </i>
<i>but he was better than me. </i>

340
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:17,350
<i>Too quiet. Too quick. </i>

341
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:19,960
<i>A killer born. </i>

342
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:22,320
<i>Why didn't he finish the job?</i>

343
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:38,320
He keeps the heads
He eats the rest

344
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:41,680
- Lucille?
- lt's not just that wolf of his

345
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:46,360
The wolf just gets scraps

346
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:48,350
Bones

347
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:50,750
lt's him

348
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:55,120
He eats people

349
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:59,270
- He cooks them like they were steaks
- Let's get you warm

350
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:01,560
Just like they were steaks

351
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:03,950
Now he's got both of us

352
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:06,950
lt's all right
Take a nice, slow breath

353
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:10,560
Just look at the heads on the wall

354
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:12,710
The heads on the wall

355
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:15,190
The heads on the wall

356
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:19,040
Son of a bitch!
He kept smiling that damned smile

357
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:23,120
He made me watch him
suck the meat off my fingers

358
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:25,760
- He made me watch
- Oh, Jesus

359
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:30,550
He made me watch

360
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:39,990
Christ, l could use a cigarette

361
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:44,320
<i>Dames. </i>
<i>Sometimes all they gotta do is let it out. </i>

362
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:47,630
<i>And a few buckets later. </i>
<i>There's no way you'd know. </i>

363
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:50,200
You've brought us
some big trouble this time, Marv

364
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:54,910
Whoever's behind this whole thing has
his connections right in the department

365
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,990
Any leads?

366
00:26:57,080 --> 00:27:00,600
One guy l talked to told me
it was Roark running the show

367
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:05,470
Whoever it is, he knew l was checking out
that hooker almost before l did

368
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:08,950
- What hooker?
- The one you've been obsessing over

369
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:11,110
The dead one

370
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:13,160
Goldie

371
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:15,680
l didn't know she was a hooker

372
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:18,830
Doesn't make any difference
about anything

373
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:25,190
- But l didn't know that
- She was high-class stuff

374
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:26,800
She must have shown you quite a time

375
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:29,000
Quiet
There's a car coming

376
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:35,160
Kevin

377
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:39,720
<i>All I've got is a face... and a name. </i>

378
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:41,710
l'll see you later, Kevin

379
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:52,480
Let's go

380
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:10,310
They're done checking the house. 

381
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:12,310
They're coming this way

382
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:15,390
Bastards
l'll show them

383
00:28:20,280 --> 00:28:24,040
You're not gonna get
either of us killed, Marv

384
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:26,880
No, don't shoot
Please

385
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:29,000
Listen to me
l'm his parole officer

386
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:31,520
He's unconscious and unarmed,

387
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:34,480
so there's no need to kill him

388
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:42,520
Captain, the target - there's no sign of him

389
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:43,830
Here's a sign

390
00:28:57,920 --> 00:29:01,630
That there is one
damn fine coat you're wearing

391
00:29:08,840 --> 00:29:12,230
<i>I keep coming back to that cop I just killed</i>
<i>and what he told me. </i>

392
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:14,960
<i>I was pretty steamed about</i>
<i>what he'd done to Lucille. </i>

393
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:17,640
<i>So I took my time</i>
<i>with that son of a bitch. </i>

394
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:21,630
<i>It wasn't till I showed him</i>
<i>all those pieces of himself that he said it. </i>

395
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:27,270
<i>Just a name -</i>
<i>Patrick Henry Roark. Man of the cloth. </i>

396
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:30,350
<i>Could've become president, </i>
<i>but he chose to serve God. </i>

397
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:34,670
<i>Along the way he happened to become</i>
<i>the most powerful man in the state. </i>

398
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:38,520
<i>He's brought down mayors</i>
<i>and governors like they were nothing. </i>

399
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:41,990
<i>He even made his rotten brother</i>
<i>a US senator without breaking a sweat. </i>

400
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:47,000
<i>And here he's gonna get killed</i>
<i>in the name of a dead hooker. </i>

401
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:51,760
<i>I'm getting used to the idea. </i>
<i>More and more I'm liking the sound of it. </i>

402
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:56,800
<i>Then it hits me like a kick in the nuts. </i>

403
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:58,630
<i>What if I'm wrong?</i>

404
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:00,470
<i>I've got a condition. </i>

405
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:02,680
<i>I get confused sometimes. </i>

406
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:06,470
<i>And with Lucille dead </i>
<i>I can't get my medicine. </i>

407
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:08,710
<i>What if I've imagined all of this?</i>

408
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:13,750
<i>What if I've finally turned into what</i>
<i>they've always said I was gonna turn into?</i>

409
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:16,200
<i>A maniac. </i>

410
00:30:16,280 --> 00:30:18,480
<i>A psycho killer. </i>

411
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:21,550
<i>Can't kill a man</i>
<i>without knowing for sure you ought to. </i>

412
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:23,600
<i>I've gotta know for sure. </i>

413
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:30,790
<i>The merchandise is on display</i>
<i>by the time I make my way to Old Town. </i>

414
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:33,600
<i>For an hour or so</i>
<i>I asked around about Goldie. </i>

415
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:36,360
<i>I don't get any answers, </i>
<i>but I know I'm bound to. </i>

416
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:38,270
<i>Lucille said Goldie was a hooker</i>

417
00:30:38,360 --> 00:30:41,240
<i>And if she was, she has roots here..</i>

418
00:30:41,320 --> 00:30:44,080
<i>friends.. maybe even family. </i>

419
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:51,520
You can't be Goldie
Goldie's dead

420
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:05,240
Goldie
Yeah, sure, right

421
00:31:05,320 --> 00:31:09,200
l haven't eaten anything
or taken my medicine for days now

422
00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:11,880
No wonder l'm seeing things

423
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:13,240
Bastard

424
00:31:18,680 --> 00:31:20,480
He's crazy

425
00:31:20,560 --> 00:31:23,520
Hit him again, Wendy
Harder

426
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:27,400
Wait a minute
Why did she call you Wendy?

427
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:29,790
Because that's my name, you ape

428
00:31:30,280 --> 00:31:34,560
Goldie was my sister
My twin sister

429
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:37,000
l guess she was the nice one

430
00:31:42,920 --> 00:31:46,520
Goldie and the other six - where are they?

431
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:48,320
What did you do to them?

432
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:50,840
You crazy goddamn broad

433
00:31:50,920 --> 00:31:52,830
Just take a look at this mug

434
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:56,960
Would any of you dames let me get
close enough to you to kill you?

435
00:31:57,040 --> 00:32:00,480
None of you would, but Goldie

436
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:03,600
And she only did because
she thought l could protect her

437
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:08,550
And l'll bet those cops didn't do a damn
thing about those other girls, did they?

438
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:13,560
But as soon as they had me for a fall guy,
they showed up, guns blazing

439
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:18,920
But they didn't get me, and l've been killing
my way to the truth ever since

440
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:22,440
So, go ahead, doll

441
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:26,990
Shoot me now,
or get the hell out of my way

442
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:35,600
Aw, nuts

443
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:39,040
OK, l'm glad we got all that sorted out

444
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:44,950
- What the hell?
- l tied those knots. That's my specialty

445
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:46,790
You sat there and took it,

446
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:49,720
when you could've taken my gun away
from me any time you wanted to

447
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:54,030
Well, sure. l thought l might be able
to talk some sense into you

448
00:32:54,120 --> 00:32:57,270
And l probably would have had
to paste you one,

449
00:32:57,360 --> 00:32:59,190
and l don't hurt girls

450
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:01,550
l need a pair of handcuffs

451
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:04,600
What style do you want?
l got a collection

452
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:08,440
Just give him the ones
you got with you, Gail

453
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:11,310
lt was a farm boy named Kevin
who killed Goldie,

454
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:14,680
but it was Cardinal Roark
who was behind it, and l don't know why

455
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:17,040
l know that sounds crazy

456
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:20,350
No, it doesn't
Goldie worked the clergy

457
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:24,720
Just like that, a whopper of a puzzle piece
falls smack in my lap

458
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:27,160
<i>I'm too dumb to put</i>
<i>the whole picture together yet. </i>

459
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:32,000
<i>But she fires up two cigarettes and hands</i>
<i>me one. And I taste her lipstick on it. </i>

460
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:36,470
<i>And suddenly, my heart's pounding</i>
<i>so loud I can't hear anything else. </i>

461
00:33:36,560 --> 00:33:40,840
<i>I want to reach over and touch her</i>
<i>and taste Goldie's sweat one more time. </i>

462
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:43,040
<i>But she isn't Goldie. </i>

463
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:45,110
<i>Yeah. Yeah. </i>
<i>This'll do. </i>

464
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:50,280
I'm also gonna be needing a dozen
two-foot lengths of this rubber tubing...

465
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:53,720
and a spool of razor wire...

466
00:33:54,840 --> 00:33:58,800
and a pair of those special gloves
that'll let me handle the wire

467
00:33:59,080 --> 00:34:01,760
Beefing up the old home security, huh?

468
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:03,240
You can bet your ass

469
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:07,470
She was my sister,
so l'm in this one to the end

470
00:34:07,560 --> 00:34:10,870
But why are you willing to go up against
Roark for someone you barely knew?

471
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:15,960
She was nice to me, gave me
something l didn't even know existed

472
00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:20,240
l wasn't never even able to buy a woman

473
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:23,000
You know, the way l look

474
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:27,520
<i>I take my mind off her</i>
<i>and I crawl back inside myself. </i>

475
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:30,440
<i>It's almost killing time, </i>
<i>and I'd better get sharp. </i>

476
00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:34,560
<i>I check the list -</i>
<i>rubber tubing, Gas, Saw,</i>

477
00:34:34,640 --> 00:34:38,520
<i>Gloves, Cuffs, Razor wire, Hatchet, </i>

478
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:40,800
<i>Gladys, and my mitts. </i>

479
00:34:40,880 --> 00:34:44,640
- We're close enough. Pull over
- Yes, Marv

480
00:34:45,720 --> 00:34:47,160
Keep the engine runnin'

481
00:34:47,240 --> 00:34:51,760
lf l'm not back in 20 minutes, you get
the hell outta here and don't look back

482
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:53,670
Kill him for me, Marv

483
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:57,680
Kill him good

484
00:34:57,760 --> 00:34:59,430
l won't let you down, Goldie

485
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:16,800
<i>Heading downstairs to the kitchen. </i>

486
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:21,400
<i>Getting himself a midnight snack, </i>
<i>and I can guess what kind. </i>

487
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:37,280
Come on, you son of a bitch

488
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:39,960
<i>Damn. He's slick. </i>

489
00:35:51,560 --> 00:35:53,950
ls that the best you can do, creep?

490
00:35:55,840 --> 00:35:59,470
<i>That's right. </i>
<i>Get personal. Get close. I can take it. </i>

491
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:04,720
l got you, you little bastard
Let's see you hop around now

492
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:13,110
<i>I try to slow my heart down</i>
<i>and breathe the fire out of my lungs. </i>

493
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:16,640
<i>My muscles make me</i>
<i>a thousand promises of pain to come. </i>

494
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:20,320
Let me do it, Marv
She was my sister. Let me finish him

495
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:22,790
You wasn't supposed
to come down here, Wendy

496
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:25,480
Oh, but l want to..

497
00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:29,600
<i>I'm sorry Kid, </i>
<i>but I haven't even started with this creep. </i>

498
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:33,800
<i>And I don't want you watching the rest. </i>
<i>It'll give you nightmares. </i>

499
00:36:33,880 --> 00:36:36,790
God, l gotta tell you, l'm good and bushed

500
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:39,950
And it's not that fight of ours
that did me in, either

501
00:36:40,040 --> 00:36:42,800
lt's all that sawing and tying

502
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:45,870
lt's not as easy as it looks

503
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:51,080
Could have been a real mess around here
if l didn't have that tubing for tourniquets

504
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:57,360
l gotta admit,
there was a spurt or two,

505
00:36:57,440 --> 00:37:02,560
to get the scent in the air,
to get that friend of yours to come running

506
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:07,790
Well, what do you know?

507
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:10,950
Look who's here

508
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:12,560
Here he comes

509
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:21,510
That's a good dog

510
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:25,600
<i>He doesn't scream. </i>
<i>Not even when the mutt's had its fill</i>

511
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:28,120
<i>and Kevin's guts</i>
<i>are lying all over the place. </i>

512
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:31,880
<i>Somehow the bastard is still alive. </i>
<i>Still staring at me. </i>

513
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:35,960
<i>Not even when I grab the saw</i>
<i>and finish the job. </i>

514
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:38,760
<i>He never screams. </i>

515
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:44,590
<i>I put in a call to Kadie's</i>
<i>and ask Nancy to get her clothes on</i>

516
00:37:44,680 --> 00:37:48,040
<i>and meet me at her place. </i>
<i>She says "Yes" like always. </i>

517
00:37:48,120 --> 00:37:50,760
Hey, Nancy, you got any beers?

518
00:37:50,840 --> 00:37:53,640
Sure, Marv
Who's the babe?

519
00:37:53,720 --> 00:37:56,480
<i>There isn't much of anything</i>
<i>Nancy wouldn't do for me. </i>

520
00:37:56,560 --> 00:37:59,160
<i>Not since a year back</i>
<i>when a frat boy roughed her up</i>

521
00:37:59,240 --> 00:38:01,520
<i>and I straightened him out but good. </i>

522
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:05,070
<i>It really gets my goat</i>
<i>when guys rough up dames. </i>

523
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:06,800
So, what do you want me to do with her?

524
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:11,270
Well, your best bet is
drive her all the way up to Sacred Oaks

525
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:14,320
What about you?
Are you leaving town?

526
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:17,040
Hell, no
l like it here

527
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:22,560
<i>I hot-wire a parked cab</i>
<i>and stay under the speed limit</i>

528
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:24,870
<i>so as not to get any attention. </i>

529
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:29,080
<i>My head starts to clear. </i>
<i>Things start to make sense. </i>

530
00:38:29,160 --> 00:38:30,960
<i>I owe you, Goldie. </i>

531
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:33,190
<i>I owe you one and I'm gonna pay up. 

532
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:36,160
<i>So, if going after Roark</i>
<i>means dying.. Win or lose... </i>

533
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:40,630
<i>hell, I'll die laughing</i>
<i>if I know I've done this one thing right. </i>

534
00:38:45,080 --> 00:38:47,440
Quiet as a grave out here
No sign of target

535
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:50,280
<i>All right. Keep a lookout. </i>

536
00:39:05,480 --> 00:39:08,680
- Kevin?
- What's left of him, anyways

537
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:11,720
The dog ate the rest

538
00:39:19,240 --> 00:39:23,240
Oh, my God
You monster

539
00:39:23,320 --> 00:39:25,960
You demon

540
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:28,470
Don't scream or l'll plug you

541
00:39:29,160 --> 00:39:34,520
He had the voice of an angel,
yet he spoke only to me

542
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:38,320
And he's dead now
because of one stupid whore

543
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:43,720
lt's not a real good idea for you to talk
about Goldie that way while l'm around

544
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:46,030
When he came to me..

545
00:39:47,320 --> 00:39:49,630
he was a tormented boy

546
00:39:51,360 --> 00:39:53,920
Tormented by guilt

547
00:39:54,760 --> 00:39:57,150
l tried to counsel him

548
00:39:58,520 --> 00:40:02,910
But the eating - it filled him with white light

549
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:07,830
Tearful, he swore to me
that he felt the touch of God Almighty

550
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:10,720
What the hell do you know?

551
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:13,080
l know it's pretty damn weird to eat people

552
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:15,960
He didn't just eat their bodies,

553
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:18,680
he ate their souls

554
00:40:20,120 --> 00:40:22,510
And l joined in

555
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:27,590
They were all whores

556
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:32,310
Nobody cared for them
Nobody missed them

557
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:37,670
And then your Goldie
almost ruined everything

558
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:39,830
<i>She stayed in public places. </i>

559
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:42,200
<i>And then with you. </i>

560
00:40:42,280 --> 00:40:43,560
<i>You were so convenient. </i>

561
00:40:44,080 --> 00:40:46,840
<i>You had broke a mans jaw </i>
<i>that very night. </i>

562
00:40:46,920 --> 00:40:49,280
Who would believe a thug like you?

563
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:51,000
<i>Kevin killed her. </i>

564
00:40:51,080 --> 00:40:54,600
<i>I ordered the police in for you, </i>
<i>but you wouldn't be caught. </i>

565
00:40:54,680 --> 00:40:56,000
<i>You wouldn't stop. </i>

566
00:40:56,080 --> 00:40:58,880
And now he's dead and you're here to...

567
00:41:00,520 --> 00:41:02,320
...eliminate me.

568
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:06,480
Will that give you satisfaction, my son?

569
00:41:08,080 --> 00:41:12,870
Killing a helpless old fart?

570
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:15,710
The killing, no

571
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:18,440
No satisfaction

572
00:41:19,240 --> 00:41:22,840
Everything up until the killing will be a gas

573
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:27,800
Kevin,

574
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:32,360
we're going home

575
00:41:35,480 --> 00:41:38,360
You can scream now if you want to

576
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:49,990
<i>It's beautiful, Goldie. </i>
<i>It's just like I promised. Only better. </i>

577
00:41:50,080 --> 00:41:51,640
<i>And when his eyes go dead. </i>

578
00:41:51,720 --> 00:41:55,640
<i>The hell I sent him to must seem like</i>
<i>heaven after what I've done to him. </i>

579
00:41:56,640 --> 00:41:58,600
- Freeze!
- Oh, my God!

580
00:42:06,920 --> 00:42:11,310
<i>Ahh Jerks. They should've shot me in the head,
and enough times to make sure. </i>

581
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:13,230
<i>It's so stupid. </i>

582
00:42:13,320 --> 00:42:17,110
<i>Everybody knows what's coming, </i>
<i>but they go through the motions anyway. </i>

583
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:19,320
<i>What a waste of time. </i>

584
00:42:19,840 --> 00:42:23,550
<i>Months fall off the calendar</i>
<i>while I breathe and eat through tubes. </i>

585
00:42:23,640 --> 00:42:27,350
<i>Night after night, I wait for somebody</i>
<i>to come and finish me off. </i>

586
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:31,070
<i>After a while, </i>
<i>I realize it's not gonna be so easy as that. </i>

587
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:33,720
<i>I'm on my feet for about ten minutes</i>

588
00:42:33,800 --> 00:42:36,600
<i>before the cops kick them out</i>
<i>from under me. </i>

589
00:42:36,680 --> 00:42:38,640
<i>They don't ask me any questions. </i>

590
00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:42,920
<i>They just keep knocking the crap out of</i>
<i>me and waving a confession in my face. </i>

591
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:44,910
<i>And I keep spitting blood all over it</i>

592
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:48,360
<i>and laughing at how many fresh copies</i>
<i>they come up with. </i>

593
00:42:48,440 --> 00:42:52,830
<i>Then along comes this worm assistant</i>
<i>district attorney who turns the recorder off</i>

594
00:42:52,920 --> 00:42:57,040
<i>and says if I don't sign their confession </i>
<i>they'll kill my mom. </i>

595
00:42:57,120 --> 00:43:00,560
<i>I break his arm in three places</i>
<i>and I sign it. </i>

596
00:43:00,640 --> 00:43:03,600
<i>From then on </i>
<i>It's the circus everybody wants it to be. </i>

597
00:43:04,200 --> 00:43:07,800
<i>They nail me for the works -</i>
<i>not just the people I did kill. </i>

598
00:43:07,880 --> 00:43:12,110
<i>But even Lucille and the girls</i>
<i>that Roark and Kevin ate. </i>

599
00:43:12,200 --> 00:43:14,400
<i>And even Goldie. </i>

600
00:43:15,160 --> 00:43:19,520
<i>The judge is all fire and brimstone</i>
<i>when she hands down the sentence. </i>

601
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:23,360
<i>Midnight and my death</i>
<i>are only a few hours away... </i>

602
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:26,510
<i>...when I get my first surprise in 18 months. </i>

603
00:43:27,960 --> 00:43:30,350
<i>My only visitor. </i>

604
00:43:30,440 --> 00:43:33,320
<i>I'm ready for anything but that scent. </i>

605
00:43:33,400 --> 00:43:36,240
l got 'em for you good,
didn't l, Goldie?

606
00:43:42,520 --> 00:43:46,830
l'm sorry, Wendy,
l got confused again

607
00:43:46,920 --> 00:43:49,560
Just seeing you like this

608
00:43:51,640 --> 00:43:54,240
You can call me Goldie

609
00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:05,870
<i>She smells like angels ought to smell. </i>

610
00:44:05,960 --> 00:44:08,560
<i>The perfect woman. </i>

611
00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:10,310
<i>The goddess. </i>

612
00:44:11,640 --> 00:44:13,600
<i>Goldie. </i>

613
00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:16,280
<i>She says her name is Goldie. </i>

614
00:44:18,760 --> 00:44:22,200
<i>They fix me a pretty decent steak</i>
<i>for my last meal. </i>

615
00:44:22,280 --> 00:44:26,560
<i>They even throw in a brew. </i>
<i>It's the first I've had since back at Nancy's. </i>

616
00:44:26,640 --> 00:44:31,030
<i>Then they shave my head and fix me</i>
<i>with a rubber diaper and get to it. </i>

617
00:44:31,120 --> 00:44:33,840
<i>And it's about damned time. </i>
<i>If you ask me. </i>

618
00:44:33,920 --> 00:44:36,480
''Yea, though l walk through the valley
of the shadow of death...''

619
00:44:36,560 --> 00:44:39,120
Would you get a move on?
l haven't got all night

620
00:44:39,200 --> 00:44:41,760
You heard the man
Hit it

621
00:44:50,720 --> 00:44:53,600
ls that the best you can do, you pansies?

622
00:45:06,360 --> 00:45:07,270
He's gone

623
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:26,480
Forget it, man

624
00:45:26,560 --> 00:45:28,600
You can bang on that door
all night if you want to

625
00:45:28,680 --> 00:45:31,240
There is no way in hell l'm letting you in

626
00:45:31,320 --> 00:45:34,470
l can't believe
you're doing this to me, Shellie

627
00:45:34,560 --> 00:45:38,790
Everything we've shared -
it has to mean something to you

628
00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:40,550
lt meant plenty

629
00:45:40,640 --> 00:45:43,760
Plenty of lost pay on account of how
nobody wants to flirt with a waitress

630
00:45:43,840 --> 00:45:46,310
whose face is all purple
and swollen up with bruises

631
00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:47,840
l know you're angry, baby

632
00:45:47,920 --> 00:45:50,990
And l forgive you for that
without you even asking me to

633
00:45:51,080 --> 00:45:52,800
There's a difference
between getting honked off

634
00:45:52,880 --> 00:45:54,470
at a guy who's generally not so bad,

635
00:45:54,560 --> 00:45:58,600
and finding out that you've been
sweet-talked by a total jerk loser

636
00:45:58,680 --> 00:46:01,040
who skips out on a wife
that he doesn't even tell you about

637
00:46:01,120 --> 00:46:03,800
every time he gets drunk,
which is way too often

638
00:46:03,880 --> 00:46:06,640
Especially the kind of total jerk loser

639
00:46:06,720 --> 00:46:09,560
who has to beat up on a girl
to make himself feel like a man

640
00:46:09,640 --> 00:46:12,000
That hurt, Shellie

641
00:46:12,080 --> 00:46:17,400
lt's one thing for you to play hard to get,
but don't go trying to cut my nuts off

642
00:46:17,480 --> 00:46:20,040
l am impossible to get

643
00:46:20,120 --> 00:46:26,230
Do yourself a favour, Jackie Boy,
and get help, like a shrink

644
00:46:26,320 --> 00:46:29,000
Get help and get lost

645
00:46:29,080 --> 00:46:30,640
Just open the door

646
00:46:30,720 --> 00:46:35,560
Go ahead and open the door, Shellie
l'll take care of this

647
00:46:35,640 --> 00:46:39,400
Just open the door and you'll see
how wrong you've been about me

648
00:46:41,080 --> 00:46:44,200
Oblige him, Shellie
l'm ready for him

649
00:46:44,280 --> 00:46:47,910
No! lf he knew that you were here with me,
you don't know how bad this could get

650
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:51,230
This clown's got a big, mean drunk on

651
00:46:51,320 --> 00:46:53,390
And he's got four friends
out there in the hall,

652
00:46:53,480 --> 00:46:55,920
breathing hard
and just as drunk as he is

653
00:46:56,000 --> 00:47:00,870
Hey, l could swear l heard somebody
in there with you just now

654
00:47:00,960 --> 00:47:06,200
Somebody! Jackie Boy,
it's a regular African love fest in here

655
00:47:07,400 --> 00:47:09,790
- l'm no racist
- l mean, l got me all five starters,

656
00:47:09,880 --> 00:47:12,920
and half the bench of
the Basin City Blues keeping me company

657
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:14,880
You feel like taking them on?

658
00:47:14,960 --> 00:47:17,920
You are teasing me, baby

659
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:21,520
Some of my best friends..

660
00:47:21,640 --> 00:47:24,080
But you're really pushing my buttons,

661
00:47:24,160 --> 00:47:26,360
and the whole time
you've been doing me like this,

662
00:47:26,440 --> 00:47:29,120
l've been too polite to point out
that at any time l want to,

663
00:47:29,200 --> 00:47:32,110
l could kick this damn door to splinters

664
00:47:32,200 --> 00:47:34,960
OK, baby, you know what l can do

665
00:47:35,040 --> 00:47:37,270
- You know what l can do. One, two..
- All right, then

666
00:47:37,360 --> 00:47:40,270
All right
All right, all right

667
00:47:42,800 --> 00:47:46,190
Troops, make yourself at home

668
00:47:54,480 --> 00:47:57,390
You brought your whole pack with you?

669
00:47:57,480 --> 00:48:00,160
None of these bozos got lives,
they gotta hang out with you?

670
00:48:00,240 --> 00:48:01,760
You're gonna love this, baby

671
00:48:01,840 --> 00:48:04,720
You're gonna call up some of your friends
who work the saloon

672
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:08,030
With you and the bunch of us,
we're gonna hit every joint in town,

673
00:48:08,120 --> 00:48:09,790
and it's gonna be great

674
00:48:09,880 --> 00:48:11,950
l ain't calling up nobody

675
00:48:16,200 --> 00:48:20,960
That's a man's shirt,
and l'm sure as hell it ain't one of mine

676
00:48:21,040 --> 00:48:25,120
You got somebody's love stink all over you

677
00:48:25,200 --> 00:48:28,480
You've been with another man
and you've been with him tonight

678
00:48:28,560 --> 00:48:31,760
- Who is he?
- He's Superman

679
00:48:31,840 --> 00:48:35,760
He flew out the window
just as soon as he heard you were coming,

680
00:48:35,840 --> 00:48:38,230
cos you scared him so bad

681
00:48:40,200 --> 00:48:44,080
You think l have no feelings at all

682
00:48:44,160 --> 00:48:46,200
lf you're gonna slug me,

683
00:48:46,280 --> 00:48:49,190
just go ahead and get it over with,
you sick bastard

684
00:48:49,280 --> 00:48:53,280
There you go,
lying about me again,

685
00:48:53,360 --> 00:48:55,920
right in front of my friends

686
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:59,230
l have never hit a woman in my life

687
00:49:04,560 --> 00:49:06,710
That's showing her, man

688
00:49:06,800 --> 00:49:11,030
You goddamn bastard
You goddamn coward

689
00:49:11,120 --> 00:49:13,920
- Baby, we're all here to have a good time
- Yeah

690
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:17,600
l gotta take a leak

691
00:49:17,680 --> 00:49:20,120
Wish you'd dropped by earlier, Jackie Boy

692
00:49:20,600 --> 00:49:23,640
Then you could've met my boyfriend

693
00:49:23,720 --> 00:49:26,190
Could've seen what a real man looks like

694
00:49:26,280 --> 00:49:29,910
There you go, after my nuts again

695
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:32,070
But l forgive you

696
00:49:32,160 --> 00:49:34,040
l'm a generous guy

697
00:49:34,120 --> 00:49:38,510
He is generous
But that temper of his..

698
00:49:38,600 --> 00:49:41,590
You never should have
picked on him like you did

699
00:49:42,160 --> 00:49:44,920
My temper you don't have to worry about

700
00:49:45,440 --> 00:49:48,960
Shut up and keep your hands to yourself
or l'll cut your little pecker off

701
00:49:49,800 --> 00:49:51,550
Ooh, l've been told

702
00:49:53,880 --> 00:49:58,400
Hey, baby,
l don't hear you making those calls

703
00:49:58,480 --> 00:50:01,120
Answer me

704
00:50:01,200 --> 00:50:03,190
Oh, l don't need this grief

705
00:50:03,280 --> 00:50:08,880
Hi. l'm Shellie's new boyfriend
and l'm out of my mind

706
00:50:08,960 --> 00:50:13,590
You ever so much as talk to Shellie again,
you even think her name,

707
00:50:13,680 --> 00:50:17,120
and l'll cut you in ways
that'll make you useless to a woman

708
00:50:17,200 --> 00:50:21,590
You're making a big mistake, man
A big mistake

709
00:50:21,680 --> 00:50:26,630
Yeah?
You already made a big mistake yourself

710
00:50:26,720 --> 00:50:29,160
You didn't flush

711
00:51:20,040 --> 00:51:21,950
Troops, get outta here

712
00:51:22,040 --> 00:51:24,110
No questions, damn it
No questions

713
00:51:24,200 --> 00:51:25,920
Now

714
00:51:43,840 --> 00:51:45,960
Dwight, what in the devil
did you do to him?

715
00:51:46,040 --> 00:51:48,950
l just gave him a taste of his own medicine

716
00:51:49,040 --> 00:51:51,000
l don't think he'll be bothering you again

717
00:51:51,480 --> 00:51:54,790
- How's your jaw?
- l've been slapped around worse

718
00:51:54,880 --> 00:51:58,720
Dwight, he was from a while back,

719
00:51:58,800 --> 00:52:02,000
before you showed up again
with that new face of yours

720
00:52:02,080 --> 00:52:05,630
And it was only cos l felt sorry for him

721
00:52:05,720 --> 00:52:08,160
And it was only once

722
00:52:08,240 --> 00:52:10,150
l've done some dumb things

723
00:52:10,240 --> 00:52:12,150
Seeing as how
l'm one of those dumb things,

724
00:52:12,240 --> 00:52:14,760
l can't give you
too hard a time about that, Shellie

725
00:52:14,840 --> 00:52:18,760
But this guy, he's a menace

726
00:52:18,840 --> 00:52:21,720
He might kill somebody if l don't stop him

727
00:52:23,560 --> 00:52:25,150
l'll call you later

728
00:52:25,240 --> 00:52:26,560
No, don't go

729
00:52:26,640 --> 00:52:28,920
<i>Shellie shouts something</i>
<i>I can't quite make out</i>

730
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:31,520
<i>over the racket of a passing police 'copter. </i>

731
00:52:31,600 --> 00:52:35,230
- Stop!
<i>- It sounds like "stop" but I can't be sure. </i>

732
00:52:35,800 --> 00:52:39,190
<i>It's a chance I shouldn't be taking, </i>
<i>but I can't just go home and forget about it. </i>

733
00:52:39,280 --> 00:52:42,560
<i>And let Jackie Boy and his pals</i>
<i>find their fun. </i>

734
00:52:42,640 --> 00:52:48,080
<i>They're a pack of predators and they're</i>
<i>out for blood tonight - a woman's blood. </i>

735
00:52:48,160 --> 00:52:51,390
Damn it, Dwight
Damn it

736
00:52:51,480 --> 00:52:54,280
You fool

737
00:52:54,360 --> 00:52:56,350
You damned fool

738
00:52:56,440 --> 00:52:58,080
<i>I cut my Caddy across the park</i>

739
00:52:58,160 --> 00:53:01,710
<i>to pick up Jackie Boy heading</i>
<i>like a bat outta hell up the hill. </i>

740
00:53:01,800 --> 00:53:03,680
<i>I'm speeding. </i>

741
00:53:03,760 --> 00:53:08,360
<i>That's a good way to get yourself noticed, </i>
<i>and if you're a murderer with a new face</i>

742
00:53:08,440 --> 00:53:12,480
<i>who's one fingerprint check away from</i>
<i>the fast track to the gas chamber like I am... </i>

743
00:53:12,560 --> 00:53:15,600
<i>...the last thing you want</i>
<i>is to get noticed. </i>

744
00:53:16,920 --> 00:53:21,120
<i>I don't have nearly enough cash on me</i>
<i>to bribe this cop. And even if I did.. </i>

745
00:53:21,200 --> 00:53:24,270
<i>..there's always the outside chance</i>
<i>he's one of the honest ones. </i>

746
00:53:24,360 --> 00:53:29,880
<i>Do I try to talk my way out of this, </i>
<i>or do I take this cop down and risk it all?</i>

747
00:53:30,360 --> 00:53:33,910
<i>Then Jackie Boy saves me</i>
<i>a great big steaming pile of trouble. </i>

748
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:36,600
Watch it, Jack

749
00:53:42,400 --> 00:53:44,120
Cops
They're right on our ass

750
00:53:44,200 --> 00:53:47,480
Not for long
Not where we're headed

751
00:53:47,560 --> 00:53:50,470
<i>My gut tightens up. </i>

752
00:53:50,560 --> 00:53:54,840
<i>Jackie Boy's leading us</i>
<i>straight to Old Town. </i>

753
00:53:57,160 --> 00:53:58,910
<i>The cop shuts off his siren. </i>

754
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:02,200
<i>He knows he's not the law. </i>
<i>Not in Old Town. </i>

755
00:54:02,280 --> 00:54:06,240
<i>The ladies are the law here. </i>
<i>Beautiful and merciless. </i>

756
00:54:06,320 --> 00:54:08,200
<i>If you've got the cash</i>
<i>and you play by the rules.. </i>

757
00:54:08,280 --> 00:54:10,640
<i>..they'll make all your dreams come true. </i>

758
00:54:10,720 --> 00:54:14,320
<i>But if you cross 'em, you're a corpse. </i>

759
00:54:22,280 --> 00:54:24,510
Hey, baby. Hey, baby

760
00:54:27,480 --> 00:54:29,390
Hop in, sugar
We'll get you there

761
00:54:29,880 --> 00:54:34,080
Aw, sweetheart. l work the day shift
and it's been a long day

762
00:54:34,160 --> 00:54:37,070
Besides, l don't do group jobs

763
00:54:37,840 --> 00:54:41,070
Get in the car, baby
We'll just talk. lt'll be nice

764
00:54:41,160 --> 00:54:43,200
l don't do talk jobs, either

765
00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:48,150
Babydoll,
l've had me one hell of a bad day

766
00:54:48,240 --> 00:54:51,710
l've been beat up every time l turn around

767
00:54:51,800 --> 00:54:53,870
But the day l get turned down by a hooker

768
00:54:53,960 --> 00:54:57,320
when l got good,
hard-earned cash to pay her with..

769
00:54:57,400 --> 00:54:59,760
well..

770
00:54:59,840 --> 00:55:02,150
there's only so much a man can take

771
00:55:02,240 --> 00:55:04,360
Go try the Alamo over on Dillon Street

772
00:55:04,440 --> 00:55:06,560
That's the Alamo, not the Amigo

773
00:55:06,640 --> 00:55:09,280
The Amigo's a fag joint

774
00:55:09,720 --> 00:55:15,400
Are you having a good time humiliating me
like this for no damn reason at all?

775
00:55:17,640 --> 00:55:20,840
That's far enough, Dwight
We've been on top of these peckerwoods

776
00:55:20,920 --> 00:55:23,280
since they first showed up
with that cop behind them

777
00:55:23,360 --> 00:55:25,320
Everything's under control

778
00:55:26,400 --> 00:55:28,470
Enjoy the show

779
00:55:28,560 --> 00:55:31,360
<i>There's no use arguing with her, </i>

780
00:55:31,440 --> 00:55:34,160
<i>the ladies are their own enforcers. </i>

781
00:55:34,240 --> 00:55:37,150
So, how's the barmaid?
You know, the one that never shuts up?

782
00:55:37,240 --> 00:55:40,120
Not right now, Gail

783
00:55:40,240 --> 00:55:42,230
Wound up a little tight, aren't we?

784
00:55:42,320 --> 00:55:45,920
That's your whole problem, Dwight
You worry too much

785
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:48,910
That, and your lousy taste in women
These days, anyway

786
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:51,910
Damn it, Gail
Not right now

787
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:55,710
Those clowns down the way -
they some of the barmaid's boyfriends?

788
00:55:55,800 --> 00:55:57,790
One of them thinks he is

789
00:55:57,880 --> 00:55:59,840
He's outta control

790
00:55:59,920 --> 00:56:03,310
l followed them here to make sure
he didn't hurt any of the girls

791
00:56:03,400 --> 00:56:06,790
Us helpless little girls

792
00:56:07,280 --> 00:56:11,200
<i>All kinds of death is about to hit</i>
<i>less than 20 yards ahead of us. </i>

793
00:56:11,280 --> 00:56:14,800
<i>And still it's hard to take my eyes off her. </i>

794
00:56:14,880 --> 00:56:17,480
Us girls are safe as we can be, Lancelot

795
00:56:17,560 --> 00:56:19,790
Those boys in that Chrysler
are one mistake away..

796
00:56:19,880 --> 00:56:22,320
..from seeing what Miho can do.

797
00:56:22,400 --> 00:56:26,030
And she's been aching for some practice.

798
00:56:27,200 --> 00:56:31,670
<i>She guides my glance upwards</i>
<i>to the pixie perched on the roof's edge. </i>

799
00:56:31,760 --> 00:56:35,880
<i>- Deadly little Miho. </i>
You're running out of alley, cowboy.

800
00:56:36,400 --> 00:56:39,950
Turn around. Save yourself
and your buddies a ton of grief.

801
00:56:40,040 --> 00:56:42,600
You're a sassy little thing.

802
00:56:42,680 --> 00:56:47,440
You ain't hardly in any kind
of position to be making threats.

803
00:56:47,520 --> 00:56:51,200
<i>The trap is set, </i>
<i>locked, and ready to spring. </i>

804
00:56:51,280 --> 00:56:54,990
<i>So what? They're scum. </i>
<i>They deserve what's coming. </i>

805
00:56:55,080 --> 00:56:58,390
<i>So why this rotten feeling in my gut</i>
<i>that something is awfully wrong?</i>

806
00:56:58,480 --> 00:57:01,600
They haven't killed anybody l know about

807
00:57:01,680 --> 00:57:06,150
lt got pretty bad at Shellie's place,
but they didn't kill anybody

808
00:57:06,240 --> 00:57:07,470
And they won't

809
00:57:07,560 --> 00:57:09,630
<i>Why this rotten feeling?</i>

810
00:57:09,720 --> 00:57:13,160
<i>Something Shellie said. </i>
<i>I can't place it. </i>

811
00:57:13,240 --> 00:57:17,160
OK, OK, OK. l sounded off
a little more than l should have

812
00:57:17,240 --> 00:57:20,120
- l'm a little on edge
- Over the edge

813
00:57:20,200 --> 00:57:23,320
lt's not a woman you need
lt's a good night's sleep

814
00:57:23,400 --> 00:57:27,030
You couldn't handle a woman,
the state you're in

815
00:57:27,120 --> 00:57:29,560
She's saying you ain't got
what it takes, Jack

816
00:57:32,120 --> 00:57:33,640
You wanna see it?

817
00:57:34,720 --> 00:57:38,110
You wanna see what l got?

818
00:57:38,200 --> 00:57:42,120
l've seen all shapes, all sizes

819
00:57:42,960 --> 00:57:45,430
You seen this one?

820
00:57:47,320 --> 00:57:48,840
Get in the car

821
00:57:48,920 --> 00:57:53,470
Aww Sugar, you just gone and done
the dumbest thing in your whole life.

822
00:58:09,840 --> 00:58:11,070
Oh, God, no

823
00:58:13,120 --> 00:58:14,600
This is crazy

824
00:58:15,520 --> 00:58:17,990
Out of nowhere, for no reason at all

825
00:58:25,360 --> 00:58:26,400
Go ahead

826
00:58:26,480 --> 00:58:29,630
Go ahead
Go ahead

827
00:58:29,720 --> 00:58:32,030
- He's got the drop on her
- He's got squat

828
00:58:32,120 --> 00:58:35,750
He's dead
He's just too damn dumb to know it

829
00:58:38,600 --> 00:58:42,230
l got you right where l want you

830
00:58:42,320 --> 00:58:45,230
This is a career-ending wound, whore

831
00:58:45,320 --> 00:58:48,760
- And there's gonna be hell to pay
- Watch your step, Jackie Boy

832
00:58:51,840 --> 00:58:53,120
Yeesh

833
00:59:00,480 --> 00:59:02,360
This isn't funny

834
00:59:03,040 --> 00:59:06,400
Don't anyone laugh
l got friends you can't imagine

835
00:59:06,480 --> 00:59:08,680
Every one of you is gonna burn

836
00:59:10,320 --> 00:59:12,520
Hang it up
She's just playing with you

837
00:59:12,600 --> 00:59:15,800
- You're only making it worse
- You shut the hell up

838
00:59:16,560 --> 00:59:19,950
Don't pull the trigger
She blocked the barrel, lt'll backfire

839
00:59:20,040 --> 00:59:23,830
l told you to shut up

840
00:59:28,600 --> 00:59:30,670
l can't see

841
00:59:30,760 --> 00:59:32,720
What's happening?

842
00:59:34,320 --> 00:59:36,520
l can't see

843
00:59:36,600 --> 00:59:39,160
l can't hear anything

844
00:59:39,240 --> 00:59:42,630
For God's sake, Miho, finish him

845
00:59:42,720 --> 00:59:46,080
Yeah
Make it quick, will you?

846
00:59:47,960 --> 00:59:50,800
<i>She doesn't quite chop his head off. </i>

847
00:59:53,520 --> 00:59:56,560
<i>She makes a Pez dispenser out of him. </i>

848
00:59:58,360 --> 01:00:01,910
<i>Then it's straight to business - stretching</i>
<i>the corpses out on the alley floor</i>

849
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:05,920
<i>and going through their pockets. </i>
<i>Divvying up cash when they find it. </i>

850
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:07,990
<i>I'm fishing around in Jackie Boy's pants. </i>

851
01:00:08,080 --> 01:00:09,800
<i>His wallet is packed. </i>

852
01:00:09,880 --> 01:00:13,670
<i>Mastercard. Discover. </i>
<i>Platinum American Express. </i>

853
01:00:13,760 --> 01:00:15,990
<i>And nearly 300 bucks worth of twenties</i>

854
01:00:16,080 --> 01:00:19,840
<i>that I'm not too proud</i>
<i>to stuff into my own pockets. </i>

855
01:00:19,920 --> 01:00:21,670
<i>Then I find an atom bomb. </i>

856
01:00:24,080 --> 01:00:26,230
<i>Jackie Boy, </i>

857
01:00:26,320 --> 01:00:28,710
<i>You son of a bitch. </i>

858
01:00:33,520 --> 01:00:35,560
<i>There was a helicopter</i>
<i>that kicked up such a racket. </i>

859
01:00:35,640 --> 01:00:38,520
<i>- I couldn't quite make out what she said. </i>

860
01:00:38,600 --> 01:00:40,990
<i>I thought Shellie said "stop. "</i>

861
01:00:41,080 --> 01:00:43,520
<i>She said "cop. "</i>

862
01:00:43,600 --> 01:00:46,720
<i>Detective Lieutenant Jack Rafferty. </i>

863
01:00:46,800 --> 01:00:50,030
<i>Iron Jack. The papers call him. </i>

864
01:00:50,120 --> 01:00:52,760
<i>A goddamn hero cop. </i>

865
01:00:54,960 --> 01:00:57,680
<i>It's held for years.. the shaky truce. </i>

866
01:00:57,760 --> 01:01:01,640
<i>The cops get a slice of the profits and free</i>
<i>entertainment when they throw a party. </i>

867
01:01:01,720 --> 01:01:04,360
<i>The girls get to administer</i>
<i>their own brand of justice. </i>

868
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:09,230
<i>They get to defend their own turf</i>
<i>lf a cop blunders into the neighbourhood</i>

869
01:01:09,320 --> 01:01:13,600
<i>and he's not shopping for what the girls</i>
<i>are selling. They send him packing. </i>

870
01:01:13,680 --> 01:01:16,150
<i>But they send him back alive. </i>

871
01:01:16,240 --> 01:01:18,310
<i>That's the rules. </i>

872
01:01:18,400 --> 01:01:20,200
<i>That's the truce. </i>

873
01:01:20,280 --> 01:01:22,670
<i>The cops stay out. </i>

874
01:01:22,760 --> 01:01:25,880
That keeps the girls free
to keep the pimps and the mob out

875
01:01:25,960 --> 01:01:28,840
Old Town will be left wide open

876
01:01:28,920 --> 01:01:30,720
lt'll be war

877
01:01:30,800 --> 01:01:34,080
The streets will run red with blood -

878
01:01:34,160 --> 01:01:36,440
women's blood

879
01:01:36,520 --> 01:01:38,910
The cops
The mob

880
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:41,520
Things are gonna go back
to the way they used to be

881
01:01:41,600 --> 01:01:45,280
The hell they will
We got guns

882
01:01:45,360 --> 01:01:47,400
We'll fight the cops and the mob

883
01:01:47,480 --> 01:01:50,680
and anybody else
who tries to move in on us

884
01:01:50,760 --> 01:01:52,240
- We'll go to war
- Don't be stupid, Gail

885
01:01:52,320 --> 01:01:55,520
You wouldn't stand a chance
Get me a car

886
01:01:55,600 --> 01:01:58,670
Make sure it's a hardtop
with a decent engine

887
01:01:58,760 --> 01:01:59,990
l'll hide the bodies

888
01:02:00,080 --> 01:02:03,520
Did you forget that cop car
that trailed them here?

889
01:02:03,600 --> 01:02:05,910
The cops know Rafferty came here

890
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:08,910
They'll check the river,
they'll check the sewer

891
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:10,800
They'll find him
and come gunning for us

892
01:02:10,880 --> 01:02:13,640
l'll haul the bodies to the pits
The cops won't check the pits

893
01:02:13,720 --> 01:02:15,520
Get that gun out of my face or l'll smack ya

894
01:02:15,600 --> 01:02:19,680
Who do you think you are, giving orders?

895
01:02:19,760 --> 01:02:22,320
- You got what you wanted out of us
- Shut up, Gail

896
01:02:22,400 --> 01:02:24,960
You got what you wanted out of me

897
01:02:25,040 --> 01:02:28,640
And you were gone,
off playing with that barmaid

898
01:02:28,720 --> 01:02:32,640
Gone until you brought
this unholy mess on us

899
01:02:32,720 --> 01:02:35,480
Miho moves to my back

900
01:02:36,920 --> 01:02:39,310
One word from Gail
and she'll cut me in half

901
01:02:39,400 --> 01:02:43,030
They'll be watching the roads
They'll catch you

902
01:02:43,120 --> 01:02:46,030
lt'll be the bad old days all over again

903
01:02:46,120 --> 01:02:48,880
The pimps, the beatings,
the drugs, the rapes

904
01:02:48,960 --> 01:02:52,750
They won't be watching the roads. Not yet,
they won't. Get me a damn hardtop

905
01:02:52,840 --> 01:02:54,880
lf l don't make it, you can have your war

906
01:02:54,960 --> 01:02:57,560
Get that gun out of my face now

907
01:03:00,040 --> 01:03:01,710
Bastard

908
01:03:06,160 --> 01:03:08,360
l forgot how quick you are

909
01:03:10,280 --> 01:03:12,000
My warrior woman

910
01:03:12,080 --> 01:03:14,520
She almost yanks my head clean off,

911
01:03:14,600 --> 01:03:17,640
shoving my mouth into hers
so hard it hurts

912
01:03:17,720 --> 01:03:21,160
An explosion that blasts away
the dull, grey years

913
01:03:21,240 --> 01:03:25,440
between the now and that one fiery night
when she was mine

914
01:03:26,240 --> 01:03:28,880
A hardtop with a decent engine,

915
01:03:28,960 --> 01:03:31,080
and make sure it's got a big trunk.

916
01:03:33,080 --> 01:03:36,150
l'll always love you, baby

917
01:03:36,240 --> 01:03:39,920
Always... and never

918
01:03:47,600 --> 01:03:49,640
Where'd you find that heap?

919
01:03:49,720 --> 01:03:53,190
Just look at that trunk
We'll never fit 'em all in

920
01:03:53,280 --> 01:03:56,560
Gail? Unless there's something else
you want me to do,

921
01:03:56,640 --> 01:03:58,550
you think maybe l could go home?

922
01:03:58,640 --> 01:04:02,680
All this blood and stuff's got me kind of
feeling like maybe l'm gonna hurl

923
01:04:02,760 --> 01:04:04,670
Sure, Becky, go home..

924
01:04:04,760 --> 01:04:07,600
..but don't you talk to anybody,
not even your mom

925
01:04:07,680 --> 01:04:10,440
They'll never fit in that trunk

926
01:04:10,520 --> 01:04:14,120
Not like this, they won't
Miho

927
01:04:14,400 --> 01:04:16,440
Dry your hair as soon as you get home

928
01:04:16,520 --> 01:04:18,590
You'll catch cold if you don't

929
01:04:26,520 --> 01:04:28,000
Yeesh

930
01:04:29,800 --> 01:04:32,400
Hey, Becky
Gail said no calls

931
01:04:32,480 --> 01:04:36,030
l just want to hear my mom's voice
l won't tell her nothing

932
01:04:36,120 --> 01:04:38,560
Please, don't say nothing to Gail

933
01:04:41,080 --> 01:04:42,480
Hey, Mom?

934
01:04:46,120 --> 01:04:47,710
Dizzy dames

935
01:04:47,800 --> 01:04:51,680
What were they thinking, sticking me
with a beat-up bucket of bolts like this?

936
01:04:51,760 --> 01:04:54,480
We were barely able to get the trunk
to stay closed as it was,

937
01:04:54,560 --> 01:04:56,120
we packed it so tight

938
01:04:56,200 --> 01:05:00,830
There wasn't anything we could do
but pile Jackie Boy in right next to me,

939
01:05:00,920 --> 01:05:04,680
out where anybody who cares to look
will see him

940
01:05:05,840 --> 01:05:09,600
Go ahead, take one of his cigarettes

941
01:05:10,520 --> 01:05:12,270
lt'll help

942
01:05:35,760 --> 01:05:40,040
lt's got you smoking there, bud

943
01:05:44,480 --> 01:05:47,240
You shut the hell up, Jackie Boy

944
01:05:47,320 --> 01:05:49,440
You're dead

945
01:05:49,520 --> 01:05:53,600
l'm just imagining this, so shut the hell up

946
01:05:53,680 --> 01:05:58,390
Well, it tells you something
about your state of mind, don't it?

947
01:05:58,480 --> 01:06:00,710
lt's got you hearing things

948
01:06:00,800 --> 01:06:03,840
lt's got your nerves shot

949
01:06:03,920 --> 01:06:06,520
lt's got you smoking

950
01:06:06,600 --> 01:06:10,230
You know it's true

951
01:06:10,320 --> 01:06:14,030
Nobody ever really quits

952
01:06:15,480 --> 01:06:20,000
A smoker's a smoker
when the chips are down

953
01:06:20,080 --> 01:06:24,760
- And your chips are down
- l'm fine. You shut the hell up

954
01:06:26,120 --> 01:06:28,640
Will you look at that?

955
01:06:30,800 --> 01:06:33,440
Those hookers let you down

956
01:06:34,760 --> 01:06:39,710
What are you gonna do
when you run outta gas, call AAA?

957
01:06:39,800 --> 01:06:43,880
You sucker for the babes, you

958
01:06:43,960 --> 01:06:46,800
You ain't even gonna make it to the pits

959
01:06:46,880 --> 01:06:49,760
You shut the hell up
l'll make it

960
01:06:49,840 --> 01:06:53,280
Not unless you keep
your eyes on the road, sugar pie

961
01:06:53,640 --> 01:06:57,190
Watch it

962
01:06:57,520 --> 01:06:59,480
This is great

963
01:06:59,560 --> 01:07:02,840
Just like being in a buddy movie

964
01:07:02,920 --> 01:07:05,070
Shut up

965
01:07:09,480 --> 01:07:11,920
Boy, you're screwed

966
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:13,960
lt's over

967
01:07:14,040 --> 01:07:16,400
You're flushed

968
01:07:16,480 --> 01:07:20,030
This time, l can't bring myself
to tell him to shut up

969
01:07:20,120 --> 01:07:23,160
Sure, he's an asshole

970
01:07:23,240 --> 01:07:25,920
Sure, he's dead

971
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:29,390
Sure, l'm just imagining that he's talking

972
01:07:29,480 --> 01:07:33,400
None of that stops the bastard
from being absolutely right

973
01:07:33,480 --> 01:07:36,680
l don't have a chance in hell
of outrunning this cop

974
01:07:36,760 --> 01:07:38,960
Not in this heap

975
01:07:39,040 --> 01:07:41,560
Pull over

976
01:07:42,880 --> 01:07:46,190
The only question left
is whether l'm gonna kill him or not

977
01:07:46,280 --> 01:07:48,720
Tough call

978
01:07:48,800 --> 01:07:51,920
For all l know,
he's an honest cop, regular guy,

979
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:55,880
a working stiff with a mortgage,
a wife and a pile of kids

980
01:07:55,960 --> 01:07:58,190
My hand moves all on its own,

981
01:07:58,280 --> 01:08:02,160
sliding one of my guns to my lap
and thumbing back the hammer

982
01:08:04,280 --> 01:08:09,070
- l don't know what to do
- You better stop. You're making him mad

983
01:08:10,240 --> 01:08:13,200
Whatever you say

984
01:08:19,880 --> 01:08:23,320
Your friend here..
party a little too hard tonight?

985
01:08:24,760 --> 01:08:27,520
l'm the designated driver

986
01:08:32,960 --> 01:08:36,080
You're driving with a busted tail light

987
01:08:40,960 --> 01:08:43,030
l'll let you off with a warning

988
01:08:50,440 --> 01:08:52,000
What next?

989
01:08:56,040 --> 01:09:00,510
The tank goes dry
a quarter mile from the pits

990
01:09:00,600 --> 01:09:03,510
l shove the T-Bird the rest of the way

991
01:09:03,600 --> 01:09:06,670
A few minutes' more work
and it'll all be over

992
01:09:06,760 --> 01:09:10,040
Jackie Boy
will go into the damn tar pits,

993
01:09:10,120 --> 01:09:14,240
l'll catch a train out of Sacred Oaks,
go home and call it a..

994
01:09:25,040 --> 01:09:27,110
No more questions, Dallas
Do what l say

995
01:09:27,200 --> 01:09:30,720
Clear the streets
We're in lockdown

996
01:09:30,800 --> 01:09:33,480
We're not selling any tail in Old Town

997
01:09:33,560 --> 01:09:35,710
Not tonight

998
01:09:39,040 --> 01:09:42,430
Don't struggle
You'll only hurt yourself

999
01:09:42,520 --> 01:09:44,720
Your cause is lost

1000
01:09:44,800 --> 01:09:46,440
We know everything

1001
01:09:46,520 --> 01:09:50,440
Soon the corpse of Detective Rafferty
will be in our possession,

1002
01:09:50,520 --> 01:09:55,310
and the truce between your prostitutes
and the police will be shattered

1003
01:09:55,400 --> 01:09:58,470
There'll be arrests
There'll be deaths

1004
01:09:58,560 --> 01:10:02,400
My employer will seize
what remains of this neighbourhood

1005
01:10:02,480 --> 01:10:06,790
You will all be slaves
Nothing can stop this

1006
01:10:06,880 --> 01:10:11,670
But it is within your power
to save many lives

1007
01:10:11,760 --> 01:10:15,840
by facilitating the process of transition,

1008
01:10:15,920 --> 01:10:21,120
by negotiating the terms
of the surrender of Old Town

1009
01:10:21,640 --> 01:10:24,110
Son of a bitch
l know you

1010
01:10:24,200 --> 01:10:29,150
l have suffered your kind before -
the dregs of Sin City

1011
01:10:29,240 --> 01:10:31,200
l serve a new master now,

1012
01:10:31,280 --> 01:10:35,880
and soon you and all your wretched kind
will serve him as well

1013
01:10:35,960 --> 01:10:41,040
Now, get dressed and shed a tear
for Dwight McCarthy if you must,

1014
01:10:41,120 --> 01:10:44,640
because, by now, he is surely dead

1015
01:10:44,720 --> 01:10:47,320
You don't know him

1016
01:10:47,400 --> 01:10:50,390
My man will find a way

1017
01:10:50,480 --> 01:10:53,440
He always finds a way

1018
01:10:54,920 --> 01:10:56,880
l can't fathom
these Americans always whining

1019
01:10:56,960 --> 01:11:00,240
and going on about how they got it so bad

1020
01:11:00,320 --> 01:11:02,550
This is a fine, grand country

1021
01:11:02,640 --> 01:11:04,790
Guiding light of the modern world, it is

1022
01:11:04,880 --> 01:11:08,000
Low taxes, land of opportunity

1023
01:11:08,080 --> 01:11:11,520
Where else would one bullet buy us
the fortune that we're getting for this?

1024
01:11:11,600 --> 01:11:14,240
Sure beats the living hell
out of blowing up airports and churches

1025
01:11:14,320 --> 01:11:16,440
without shite to show for it

1026
01:11:18,240 --> 01:11:20,200
Yeesh

1027
01:11:21,240 --> 01:11:22,880
You find something, Murphy?

1028
01:11:22,960 --> 01:11:26,000
Looks to be a poor, dead cop's badge

1029
01:11:26,080 --> 01:11:27,990
lt's all bent up

1030
01:11:28,080 --> 01:11:30,800
What's this stuck in it?

1031
01:11:30,880 --> 01:11:32,870
Bloody hell
lt's the bullet

1032
01:11:41,680 --> 01:11:45,150
You son of a bitch
Bastard

1033
01:11:46,560 --> 01:11:48,760
They weren't cops, these four

1034
01:11:48,840 --> 01:11:50,750
They were mercenaries

1035
01:11:50,840 --> 01:11:52,880
And if they were hired
by who l think they were,

1036
01:11:53,200 --> 01:11:55,800
the bad times haven't even started yet

1037
01:11:55,880 --> 01:11:59,430
And everything seemed
to be going so well

1038
01:12:10,760 --> 01:12:15,630
Remember, we don't have to
deliver every last inch of the man, Brian

1039
01:12:15,720 --> 01:12:18,000
You got a good point there, Ronnie

1040
01:12:18,080 --> 01:12:21,200
Lend me your knife

1041
01:12:21,280 --> 01:12:24,270
Should l take a nap
while l'm doing all this waiting?

1042
01:12:24,360 --> 01:12:27,270
l'm at the bone, all right?

1043
01:12:29,240 --> 01:12:31,280
There we go

1044
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:38,120
Have you ever seen anything so pretty
in your whole life?

1045
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:42,600
We'll be back for the three of you,
and if anyone happens by,

1046
01:12:42,680 --> 01:12:45,400
use your imagination, OK?

1047
01:12:54,920 --> 01:12:57,040
Silence, now

1048
01:12:57,120 --> 01:12:59,480
No air to breathe

1049
01:12:59,560 --> 01:13:03,480
Only the horrid, oily tar taste
creeping up my nostrils

1050
01:13:04,760 --> 01:13:08,760
Let it in
Let it fill your lungs

1051
01:13:08,840 --> 01:13:12,310
They were counting on you
and you blew it

1052
01:13:13,400 --> 01:13:17,400
Skinny, steely fingers at my wrist

1053
01:13:17,480 --> 01:13:20,950
Miho, you're an angel

1054
01:13:21,040 --> 01:13:22,840
You're a saint

1055
01:13:22,920 --> 01:13:25,120
You're Mother Teresa

1056
01:13:25,200 --> 01:13:27,190
You're Elvis

1057
01:13:27,280 --> 01:13:29,430
You're God

1058
01:13:30,080 --> 01:13:35,360
And if you'd shown up ten minutes
earlier, we'd still have Jackie Boy's head

1059
01:13:35,840 --> 01:13:38,720
Dwight, they got Gail

1060
01:13:39,720 --> 01:13:42,870
lt's a cinch
You got yourselves a spy in Old Town

1061
01:13:42,960 --> 01:13:45,680
A stoolie who sold you out to the mob

1062
01:13:45,760 --> 01:13:47,960
We gotta find out who it is and rescue Gail

1063
01:13:48,040 --> 01:13:50,000
But first, we gotta get
our hands on Jackie Boy's head

1064
01:13:50,080 --> 01:13:54,280
before it gets to wherever it's going
and this whole situation blows wide open

1065
01:13:54,360 --> 01:13:59,390
Miho, l hope to hell
you left one of 'em alive enough to talk

1066
01:14:06,960 --> 01:14:09,950
l let him know l'm not fooling around

1067
01:14:14,640 --> 01:14:16,680
We talk

1068
01:14:25,320 --> 01:14:28,920
Stay smart
Stay cool

1069
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:32,200
lt's time to prove to your friends
that you're worth a damn

1070
01:14:32,280 --> 01:14:35,350
Sometimes, that means dying

1071
01:14:35,440 --> 01:14:38,670
Sometimes, it means killing
a whole lot of people

1072
01:14:38,760 --> 01:14:41,280
There they are
What do we do?

1073
01:14:41,840 --> 01:14:43,430
We stop 'em, Dallas

1074
01:14:51,320 --> 01:14:53,440
Jackie Boy's head is so close to me

1075
01:14:53,520 --> 01:14:57,150
l could almost reach out
and grab it right then and there

1076
01:15:02,240 --> 01:15:04,390
Get the head
Get the head

1077
01:15:05,880 --> 01:15:07,870
l got it
l got it

1078
01:15:14,280 --> 01:15:17,080
Suck on this, you stupid slag

1079
01:15:20,920 --> 01:15:23,640
l can't tell if Miho is alive or dead,

1080
01:15:23,720 --> 01:15:28,190
but l'm on my feet and every ounce of me
wants to get some killing done

1081
01:15:30,840 --> 01:15:35,230
You want the head now, sweetheart?
So come down and get it

1082
01:15:39,720 --> 01:15:41,870
Brave lad

1083
01:15:41,960 --> 01:15:45,720
l could've put a bullet
straight down your ear just now,

1084
01:15:45,800 --> 01:15:49,430
if l hadn't got me revolver
all wet and useless

1085
01:15:49,520 --> 01:15:51,560
You got the drop on me, love

1086
01:15:51,640 --> 01:15:54,110
l'm as helpless as a baby

1087
01:16:00,840 --> 01:16:03,520
l got to come clean with you, sweetheart

1088
01:16:03,600 --> 01:16:08,390
lt was an outright lie l was giving ya
about me revolver being wet

1089
01:16:08,480 --> 01:16:10,950
You see, l'm not too fond of shootin'

1090
01:16:11,040 --> 01:16:14,000
lt's my preference to blow things up

1091
01:16:14,080 --> 01:16:16,470
Once you blast the roof off a pub

1092
01:16:16,560 --> 01:16:20,110
and seen all the parts flying off people,

1093
01:16:20,200 --> 01:16:23,960
a little bang bang's
never gonna match the sight of that

1094
01:16:24,040 --> 01:16:29,510
And here's me, with all these fine grenades
and such a sweet beauty of a remote

1095
01:16:29,600 --> 01:16:32,830
But it's me knife l'll be doing you with

1096
01:16:32,920 --> 01:16:35,560
You killed me mates

1097
01:16:35,640 --> 01:16:39,840
Someone shoulda told ya - never give
an lrishman good cause for revenge

1098
01:16:41,720 --> 01:16:43,840
Deadly little Miho

1099
01:16:44,560 --> 01:16:47,200
You won't feel a thing
unless she wants you to

1100
01:16:47,280 --> 01:16:50,120
She twists the blade

1101
01:16:50,440 --> 01:16:51,840
He feels it

1102
01:16:54,520 --> 01:16:58,070
l tell Miho what we're gonna do
and how we're gonna do it

1103
01:16:58,160 --> 01:17:02,390
l grab poor Dallas's car phone and make
the most important call of my life

1104
01:17:02,480 --> 01:17:07,240
First, we gotta rescue Gail,
then comes the kill

1105
01:17:07,320 --> 01:17:11,110
The big, fat kill

1106
01:17:21,040 --> 01:17:23,760
Do we just gotta stand here
and watch this?

1107
01:17:23,840 --> 01:17:25,910
What, are you kidding me, man?

1108
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:29,360
l could watch old Manute do his thing
all night long and not get tired of it

1109
01:17:29,440 --> 01:17:30,760
l mean, the man's an artist

1110
01:17:30,840 --> 01:17:35,760
Only an artist should be allowed
to touch such a beautiful subject

1111
01:17:35,840 --> 01:17:37,670
Your skin is perfect

1112
01:17:37,760 --> 01:17:40,830
Your nerves, responsive

1113
01:17:40,920 --> 01:17:42,070
Beautiful

1114
01:17:42,160 --> 01:17:45,150
Just give them what they want, Gail

1115
01:17:49,040 --> 01:17:52,000
- Becky?
- lt's over, Gail

1116
01:17:52,560 --> 01:17:56,160
There's no fighting them
Dwight's dead

1117
01:17:56,240 --> 01:17:58,390
They got what's left of that cop we killed

1118
01:17:58,480 --> 01:18:01,360
The mob's gonna turn it over to the police
chief, the cops are gonna mow us down

1119
01:18:01,440 --> 01:18:03,270
We gotta cut a deal

1120
01:18:03,360 --> 01:18:06,720
You little bitch
You sold us out

1121
01:18:06,800 --> 01:18:09,710
l didn't have no choice
They was gonna hurt my mom

1122
01:18:09,800 --> 01:18:11,950
You gotta cut a deal with these people

1123
01:18:12,040 --> 01:18:14,080
lt's selfish, you holding out like this

1124
01:18:14,160 --> 01:18:16,630
You're gonna get a lot of girls killed
for no good reason

1125
01:18:16,720 --> 01:18:19,190
lt wasn't your mom

1126
01:18:19,280 --> 01:18:22,160
We could have protected her
and you know it

1127
01:18:22,240 --> 01:18:24,960
lt was the money, you stupid little bitch

1128
01:18:25,040 --> 01:18:28,750
Sure, there's money. Sure, you could've
moved my mom into Old Town

1129
01:18:28,840 --> 01:18:31,440
and let her know
that her daughter's a goddamn whore

1130
01:18:31,520 --> 01:18:33,560
Breaks your heart, doesn't it?

1131
01:18:33,640 --> 01:18:38,190
They offered me what you couldn't
never offer me - a way out

1132
01:18:38,280 --> 01:18:40,160
l had to watch out for my own neck

1133
01:18:40,240 --> 01:18:41,830
Your neck

1134
01:18:41,920 --> 01:18:45,880
Your precious, scrawny, little neck

1135
01:18:49,840 --> 01:18:53,760
You're crazy. You could have
ripped my throat out, you crazy whore

1136
01:18:55,160 --> 01:18:58,440
Schutz, fetch my blades

1137
01:18:58,520 --> 01:19:02,400
- Stuka, kill this one
- No, l was promised

1138
01:19:02,480 --> 01:19:05,280
Stupid little bitch
You deserve worse

1139
01:19:05,360 --> 01:19:08,640
l knew there was a reason
l got out of bed this morning

1140
01:19:15,520 --> 01:19:17,000
Nobody
l don't see nobody

1141
01:19:17,080 --> 01:19:20,520
Will you look at that?
lt's right through me. Guys, look

1142
01:19:20,600 --> 01:19:23,360
There's something wrapped around it

1143
01:19:23,440 --> 01:19:25,240
Some kind of note

1144
01:19:25,320 --> 01:19:27,360
Give it to me

1145
01:19:27,440 --> 01:19:30,200
lt's poked right through me
Guys, look

1146
01:19:31,680 --> 01:19:34,200
- lt's starting to really hurt
- Out back. Everyone

1147
01:19:34,280 --> 01:19:36,030
And bring the women

1148
01:19:36,120 --> 01:19:39,320
Do you think somebody
should call me a doctor or something?

1149
01:19:39,800 --> 01:19:41,920
McCarthy, you fool

1150
01:19:45,640 --> 01:19:47,000
Guys?

1151
01:19:53,200 --> 01:19:57,320
Dozens of them, armed to the teeth

1152
01:19:57,400 --> 01:20:01,240
l'm outnumbered, outgunned

1153
01:20:01,320 --> 01:20:06,600
But the alley is crooked,
dark and very narrow

1154
01:20:06,680 --> 01:20:09,360
They can't surround me

1155
01:20:09,440 --> 01:20:14,390
Sometimes, you can beat the odds
with the careful choice of where to fight

1156
01:20:18,360 --> 01:20:20,830
You can have Old Town, l don't care

1157
01:20:21,520 --> 01:20:25,310
Just give me the woman

1158
01:20:25,400 --> 01:20:27,310
Shut up

1159
01:20:27,400 --> 01:20:30,280
Dwight, don't do this

1160
01:20:30,360 --> 01:20:34,480
- Hey, wait a minute. Something's not right
- Shut up, or l'll plug you

1161
01:20:34,560 --> 01:20:38,030
Of course, Mr McCarthy
A fair trade

1162
01:20:38,120 --> 01:20:39,840
She's all yours

1163
01:20:48,320 --> 01:20:52,920
Now, if you'll explain to me why
we shouldn't blow both of you to pieces..

1164
01:20:53,000 --> 01:20:56,600
Dwight, what have you done?

1165
01:20:56,680 --> 01:20:58,640
Exactly what l had to

1166
01:20:59,960 --> 01:21:02,400
Every step of the way

1167
01:21:04,880 --> 01:21:07,840
No. lt isn't right
There wasn't no tape over his mouth

1168
01:21:07,920 --> 01:21:10,070
How come there's tape over his mouth?

1169
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:24,200
Where to fight counts for a lot

1170
01:21:24,280 --> 01:21:28,750
Cute trick, McCarthy,
but it will do you do good

1171
01:21:28,840 --> 01:21:32,880
But there's nothing like having
your friends show up with lots of guns

1172
01:21:32,960 --> 01:21:35,720
No
McCarthy, you shit

1173
01:21:38,040 --> 01:21:40,720
The girls all know the score

1174
01:21:41,800 --> 01:21:47,240
No escape, no surrender, no mercy

1175
01:21:47,320 --> 01:21:51,030
We gotta kill every last
rat bastard one of 'em

1176
01:21:51,120 --> 01:21:53,030
Every last one

1177
01:21:53,120 --> 01:21:57,240
Not for revenge,
not because they deserve it,

1178
01:21:57,320 --> 01:22:00,440
not because it'll make
the world a better place

1179
01:22:01,520 --> 01:22:03,240
We need a heap of bloody bodies

1180
01:22:03,320 --> 01:22:07,200
so when mob boss Wallenquist
looks over his charts of profits and losses,

1181
01:22:07,280 --> 01:22:11,320
he'll see what it cost him
to mess with the girls of Old Town

1182
01:22:11,400 --> 01:22:14,470
The Valkyrie at my side
is shouting and laughing

1183
01:22:14,560 --> 01:22:19,800
with the pure, hateful,
bloodthirsty joy of the slaughter,

1184
01:22:19,880 --> 01:22:22,000
and so am l

1185
01:22:26,720 --> 01:22:28,680
The fire, baby

1186
01:22:28,760 --> 01:22:31,480
lt'll burn us both

1187
01:22:31,560 --> 01:22:35,350
There's no place in this world
for our kind of fire,

1188
01:22:35,440 --> 01:22:39,720
my warrior woman, my Valkyrie

1189
01:22:39,800 --> 01:22:42,560
You'll always be mine

1190
01:22:42,640 --> 01:22:44,710
Always..

1191
01:22:44,800 --> 01:22:46,360
and never

1192
01:22:58,990 --> 01:23:01,990
Evenin', officer

1193
01:23:02,070 --> 01:23:06,860
l don't have to introduce myself, do l?
You read the papers

1194
01:23:06,950 --> 01:23:10,150
This being an election year,
you've seen plenty of my picture

1195
01:23:10,230 --> 01:23:13,620
You know who l am and what l can do

1196
01:23:13,710 --> 01:23:16,470
And l'm doin' you, Hartigan

1197
01:23:16,550 --> 01:23:19,150
Cold and hard, l'm doing you

1198
01:23:19,230 --> 01:23:21,430
You blew my son's ear off

1199
01:23:22,870 --> 01:23:27,790
You blew his arm off
You even blew his nuts and his pecker off

1200
01:23:29,870 --> 01:23:33,470
He's in a coma right now
They say he may never come out of it

1201
01:23:33,550 --> 01:23:35,310
My boy

1202
01:23:35,390 --> 01:23:37,950
He could've been the first Roark to become
the President of the United States,

1203
01:23:38,030 --> 01:23:42,110
but you went and turned him into
a brain-damaged, dickless freak

1204
01:23:42,590 --> 01:23:45,870
Pullin' that trigger make you feel powerful?

1205
01:23:46,630 --> 01:23:50,630
Power don't come from a badge or a gun

1206
01:23:51,430 --> 01:23:53,990
Power comes from lying

1207
01:23:54,070 --> 01:23:58,700
Lying big, and gettin' the whole
damn world to play along with you

1208
01:23:58,790 --> 01:24:01,670
Once you got everybody agreeing with
what they know in their hearts ain't true,

1209
01:24:01,750 --> 01:24:04,390
you've got 'em by the balls

1210
01:24:04,470 --> 01:24:09,630
There's what,
maybe 500 people in this hospital?

1211
01:24:11,710 --> 01:24:15,590
l could pump you full of bullets right now,
and l wouldn't even be arrested

1212
01:24:15,670 --> 01:24:18,950
Everyone would lie for me -
everyone who counts

1213
01:24:19,030 --> 01:24:21,710
Otherwise, all their own lies -
everything that runs Sin City -

1214
01:24:21,790 --> 01:24:25,670
it all comes tumbling down
like a pack of cards

1215
01:24:28,910 --> 01:24:32,270
But l want you firm and fit and healthy

1216
01:24:32,350 --> 01:24:35,310
l'm even putting up cash of my own
to get you more surgery

1217
01:24:35,390 --> 01:24:38,310
Fix that heart condition of yours

1218
01:24:40,110 --> 01:24:43,710
You're gonna keep on living a long time
l'm gonna make sure of that

1219
01:24:45,110 --> 01:24:49,980
You're gonna be convicted of raping
that little brat, and shooting my boy

1220
01:24:50,070 --> 01:24:52,430
And you're gonna spend
the rest of your life in prison,

1221
01:24:52,510 --> 01:24:56,190
disgraced, destroyed..

1222
01:24:56,270 --> 01:24:58,230
alone

1223
01:24:59,070 --> 01:25:00,950
Your wife?

1224
01:25:01,030 --> 01:25:03,070
You tell her the truth and she's dead

1225
01:25:03,150 --> 01:25:06,150
You tell anybody the truth
and they're dead

1226
01:25:07,870 --> 01:25:09,780
They won't let me testify

1227
01:25:09,870 --> 01:25:13,870
l told the cops that you saved my life
and they just acted like l was crazy

1228
01:25:13,950 --> 01:25:16,630
They talked my parents
into keeping me away

1229
01:25:16,710 --> 01:25:19,310
They said that you'd done things
that you didn't do

1230
01:25:19,390 --> 01:25:21,700
l told them that you saved me
from that Roark creep,

1231
01:25:21,790 --> 01:25:25,830
but they won't even check me out
to see that l'm still a virgin

1232
01:25:25,910 --> 01:25:30,230
l'm still a virgin, still alive -
thanks to you

1233
01:25:30,830 --> 01:25:32,550
They got it all backwards

1234
01:25:32,630 --> 01:25:36,100
Sometimes, the truth
doesn't matter like it ought

1235
01:25:36,190 --> 01:25:39,550
But you'll always remember things right

1236
01:25:39,630 --> 01:25:41,700
That's gonna mean a lot to me

1237
01:25:43,390 --> 01:25:48,180
But stay away, Nancy
They'll kill you if you don't stay away

1238
01:25:48,270 --> 01:25:50,070
Don't visit me

1239
01:25:50,150 --> 01:25:52,030
Don't write me

1240
01:25:52,110 --> 01:25:54,070
Don't even say my name

1241
01:25:54,550 --> 01:25:58,510
Maybe you won't let me visit,
but l'll still write to you, Hartigan

1242
01:25:58,590 --> 01:26:00,500
l'll sign my letters ''Cordelia''

1243
01:26:00,950 --> 01:26:04,830
That's the name of a really cool
detective in books l read

1244
01:26:04,910 --> 01:26:09,190
l'll write you every week, for forever

1245
01:26:09,270 --> 01:26:11,910
Sure, kid

1246
01:26:11,990 --> 01:26:14,060
Now, run on home

1247
01:26:14,150 --> 01:26:16,270
lt's not safe for you here

1248
01:26:20,070 --> 01:26:22,710
Bye, Nancy

1249
01:26:25,030 --> 01:26:27,310
l love you

1250
01:26:35,270 --> 01:26:37,150
John Hartigan

1251
01:26:38,110 --> 01:26:40,070
Mr. Law and Order

1252
01:26:41,510 --> 01:26:44,270
Mr. By the Book

1253
01:26:44,350 --> 01:26:46,500
Mr. High and Mighty

1254
01:26:48,750 --> 01:26:52,030
l gotta give you credit, being such
a straight arrow for so damn many years

1255
01:26:52,110 --> 01:26:54,180
without it catching up with you

1256
01:26:54,270 --> 01:26:57,270
lt's catching up with you now,
friend of mine

1257
01:26:57,350 --> 01:26:59,580
lt's catching up with you but good

1258
01:27:04,030 --> 01:27:06,150
Maybe l oughta look at him
He doesn't look too good

1259
01:27:07,750 --> 01:27:12,430
He's hale and hearty, Tammy. See?

1260
01:27:12,510 --> 01:27:15,590
He's the picture of health

1261
01:27:15,670 --> 01:27:19,110
That Tammy, there - she's fine, isn't she?

1262
01:27:19,190 --> 01:27:21,230
l rented her out of Old Town

1263
01:27:21,310 --> 01:27:25,910
l wanted to show you what you won't
be getting any of, not in prison

1264
01:27:25,990 --> 01:27:27,140
You hear me, Hartigan?

1265
01:27:27,230 --> 01:27:30,700
lf you stop being stupid,
start playing along with us,

1266
01:27:30,790 --> 01:27:33,510
you might just get some of Tammy

1267
01:27:33,590 --> 01:27:37,270
You see that?
She flinched

1268
01:27:37,350 --> 01:27:39,470
You make her sick

1269
01:27:39,550 --> 01:27:42,190
She heard about you and that little girl

1270
01:27:42,270 --> 01:27:46,590
This is nothing but a price l promised
myself l'd pay, and l'm paying it

1271
01:27:46,670 --> 01:27:50,950
You don't save a little girl's life, then
turn around and throw her to the dogs

1272
01:27:51,030 --> 01:27:52,790
Not in my book, you don't

1273
01:27:52,870 --> 01:27:56,260
They want a confession
They won't get it

1274
01:27:59,150 --> 01:28:02,940
There was a letter from Nancy waiting
when they put me in solitary

1275
01:28:03,030 --> 01:28:06,030
She calls herself ''Cordelia'',
just like she promised

1276
01:28:06,110 --> 01:28:09,660
She makes no mention of anything
that would give her away

1277
01:28:10,550 --> 01:28:12,620
At first, l figure
she'll send another note or two

1278
01:28:12,710 --> 01:28:15,710
before her young mind
moves on to better things

1279
01:28:15,790 --> 01:28:18,990
But every Thursday, another one arrives

1280
01:28:19,070 --> 01:28:20,790
What a sweet kid

1281
01:28:21,430 --> 01:28:25,110
l do my best to keep my hand
from shaking when l reach for it

1282
01:28:25,190 --> 01:28:29,390
She's the only friend l've got -
the daughter l never had

1283
01:28:29,470 --> 01:28:31,380
My sweet Cordelia

1284
01:28:31,470 --> 01:28:34,070
Skinny little Nancy Callahan

1285
01:28:35,750 --> 01:28:38,060
Eight years pass

1286
01:28:42,310 --> 01:28:45,270
Then comes a Thursday
when l bound from my cot,

1287
01:28:45,350 --> 01:28:47,310
excited as a kid at Christmas,

1288
01:28:47,390 --> 01:28:50,750
only to find myself
staring at the damn floor of my damn cell,

1289
01:28:50,830 --> 01:28:53,950
looking for a letter from Nancy
that isn't there

1290
01:28:54,390 --> 01:28:56,780
Then another Thursday with no letter

1291
01:28:56,870 --> 01:28:58,630
ls she all right?

1292
01:28:58,710 --> 01:29:00,910
Did something happen to her?

1293
01:29:00,990 --> 01:29:03,510
Nothing

1294
01:29:03,590 --> 01:29:07,060
Two months now -
not a word from Nancy

1295
01:29:07,150 --> 01:29:10,540
Did they find her?
Did they get to her?

1296
01:29:10,630 --> 01:29:13,910
Of course
Stupid old man

1297
01:29:13,990 --> 01:29:17,380
Do your maths
Nancy's 19 years old

1298
01:29:17,470 --> 01:29:19,990
How long did you expect her
to keep writing?

1299
01:29:20,070 --> 01:29:23,540
She was a saint to keep it up
as long as she did

1300
01:29:23,630 --> 01:29:26,630
She's forgotten you, old man

1301
01:29:26,710 --> 01:29:28,590
You're alone

1302
01:29:28,670 --> 01:29:30,820
You're all alone

1303
01:29:38,070 --> 01:29:41,860
This guy smells awful -
like bad food

1304
01:29:41,950 --> 01:29:45,100
Like a corpse left in a garbage dumpster
in the middle of summer

1305
01:29:45,190 --> 01:29:47,340
He stinks so bad, l want to throw up

1306
01:29:57,750 --> 01:30:00,710
Practically knocked my head off,
the bastard

1307
01:30:01,350 --> 01:30:03,420
When l come to, l see it

1308
01:30:03,510 --> 01:30:06,710
The same kind of envelope
Nancy always uses,

1309
01:30:06,790 --> 01:30:09,100
but there's no letter inside of it

1310
01:30:09,190 --> 01:30:11,150
There's something soft,

1311
01:30:11,230 --> 01:30:14,990
something that ought to be alive -
a hunk of meat and bone

1312
01:30:15,070 --> 01:30:19,030
that ought to be the index finger
of the right hand of a 19-year-old girl

1313
01:30:19,110 --> 01:30:21,150
How the hell did they find her?

1314
01:30:21,230 --> 01:30:22,950
She was so careful

1315
01:30:23,030 --> 01:30:25,750
She never gave away
where she lives or where she works

1316
01:30:30,590 --> 01:30:33,820
l've got to get out
l've got to help her

1317
01:30:33,910 --> 01:30:38,910
Nothing else matters -
not my life and not my pride, either

1318
01:30:38,990 --> 01:30:41,590
lt's only one final surrender they want

1319
01:30:41,670 --> 01:30:45,140
You got me, Roark
You beat me

1320
01:30:45,670 --> 01:30:49,220
l say everything they want to hear,
just the way they want to hear it

1321
01:30:49,310 --> 01:30:52,510
l tell them l'm a twisted,
wretched child molester

1322
01:30:52,590 --> 01:30:55,900
l agree to everything they want from me

1323
01:30:55,990 --> 01:30:57,980
l love you, Nancy

1324
01:31:09,270 --> 01:31:11,790
lt's a lot of miles into town, Hartigan

1325
01:31:14,270 --> 01:31:18,790
- You care for a ride?
- Long as you stay in front of me

1326
01:31:18,870 --> 01:31:22,580
Prison's made you paranoid
Talk about water under the bridge

1327
01:31:22,670 --> 01:31:24,980
Christ

1328
01:31:25,070 --> 01:31:27,750
Eight years

1329
01:31:27,830 --> 01:31:31,060
Yeah
Eight years

1330
01:31:32,390 --> 01:31:35,230
Well, if it's any consolation to you..

1331
01:31:37,070 --> 01:31:39,190
you made me hate myself

1332
01:31:41,510 --> 01:31:44,630
- Any word from Eileen?
- Yeah

1333
01:31:44,870 --> 01:31:48,750
She got remarried four years ago

1334
01:31:50,870 --> 01:31:54,870
She had two kids
l'm sorry, John

1335
01:31:54,950 --> 01:31:56,910
Don't be

1336
01:31:56,990 --> 01:31:59,300
l'm glad

1337
01:31:59,390 --> 01:32:02,470
Eileen always wanted kids

1338
01:32:02,550 --> 01:32:04,460
She'll make a good mother

1339
01:32:06,310 --> 01:32:10,550
Like you said, Bob -
water under the bridge

1340
01:32:20,910 --> 01:32:24,190
Bob and l get on
with our fond farewells to each other,

1341
01:32:24,270 --> 01:32:28,150
then l go looking for the only human being
on the planet who means a damn to me -

1342
01:32:28,230 --> 01:32:29,630
Nancy

1343
01:32:29,710 --> 01:32:32,940
How could they have found out it was you
writing all those letters to me?

1344
01:32:33,390 --> 01:32:35,620
How did they find out who you are?

1345
01:32:35,710 --> 01:32:38,790
And what have they done to you, baby?

1346
01:32:42,430 --> 01:32:44,340
Not a sound

1347
01:32:44,430 --> 01:32:47,190
No sign of life

1348
01:32:47,270 --> 01:32:50,790
Has Roark gone to all this trouble
just to torture a broken old man,

1349
01:32:50,870 --> 01:32:54,420
like a kid poking at a fly
when he's already torn his wings off?

1350
01:32:54,510 --> 01:32:57,150
What has he done to Nancy?

1351
01:32:57,230 --> 01:32:59,790
lt's like all she ever does
is read and study and write

1352
01:33:00,270 --> 01:33:05,140
No diary, no phone numbers
or addresses written down anywhere

1353
01:33:06,150 --> 01:33:09,910
Closest thing to a clue
is a pack of matches from a lousy saloon

1354
01:33:10,590 --> 01:33:15,140
lt's a long shot,
but maybe she's got some friends there

1355
01:33:21,350 --> 01:33:23,500
A dead end

1356
01:33:23,590 --> 01:33:27,060
Nancy wouldn't have anything to do
with a pack of drunks and losers like this

1357
01:33:27,150 --> 01:33:30,990
But if there's anything to be found here,
the faintest lead to wherever Nancy is

1358
01:33:31,070 --> 01:33:34,030
or whoever kidnapped her
and mutilated her, this is the place

1359
01:33:34,270 --> 01:33:38,900
Excuse me, miss. Wondering if you
could help me. l'm looking for somebody

1360
01:33:38,990 --> 01:33:42,070
Cold night like this, everybody's
looking for somebody, stranger

1361
01:33:42,150 --> 01:33:44,870
lt's not like that
Her name is Nancy

1362
01:33:44,950 --> 01:33:47,420
Eyes to the stage, pilgrim

1363
01:33:47,510 --> 01:33:50,660
She's just warming up

1364
01:33:58,230 --> 01:34:01,110
Skinny little Nancy Callahan

1365
01:34:01,190 --> 01:34:02,990
She grew up

1366
01:34:03,070 --> 01:34:05,870
She filled out

1367
01:34:05,950 --> 01:34:09,550
Nancy Callahan, 19 years old

1368
01:34:11,350 --> 01:34:14,350
And here l was,
expecting a skinny little bookworm,

1369
01:34:14,430 --> 01:34:17,980
maybe a bit too shy for her own good

1370
01:34:18,070 --> 01:34:23,710
How little she told me about herself
in all her letters for all those years

1371
01:34:27,710 --> 01:34:29,940
How the hell did they find her?

1372
01:34:30,030 --> 01:34:32,550
Then it hits me

1373
01:34:32,630 --> 01:34:34,670
They were bluffing

1374
01:34:35,630 --> 01:34:38,390
l've led them straight to her

1375
01:34:46,190 --> 01:34:49,070
She hasn't spotted you yet

1376
01:34:49,150 --> 01:34:51,750
Turn around and walk out the door

1377
01:34:52,830 --> 01:34:54,390
Lead the creep outside

1378
01:34:54,470 --> 01:34:59,550
Get that Beretta away from him somehow,
and kill him

1379
01:34:59,630 --> 01:35:03,420
l'm just a horny ex-con
watching an exotic dancer

1380
01:35:03,510 --> 01:35:06,350
Just a few seconds and she'll be safe

1381
01:35:06,990 --> 01:35:09,670
No, Nancy
Don't notice me

1382
01:35:09,750 --> 01:35:13,030
Don't recognise me

1383
01:35:22,270 --> 01:35:24,230
There's no time to explain

1384
01:35:24,310 --> 01:35:27,270
l've made a terrible mistake,
put you in terrible danger

1385
01:35:27,350 --> 01:35:29,470
We need to get out of here
right this second

1386
01:35:29,550 --> 01:35:33,230
Whatever you say, Hartigan
Let me throw some clothes on

1387
01:35:35,270 --> 01:35:39,870
And here l'd figured you'd forgotten
all about me. Me and my dumb letters

1388
01:35:39,950 --> 01:35:42,340
Kept me going

1389
01:35:43,550 --> 01:35:45,670
Kept me from killing myself

1390
01:35:47,350 --> 01:35:49,390
Hurry up, will you?

1391
01:35:54,710 --> 01:35:57,430
- Maybe l should drive
- Not a chance

1392
01:35:58,150 --> 01:36:00,950
Nobody but me
can keep this heap running

1393
01:36:06,470 --> 01:36:09,910
Besides, from the sound of things,
you might have to shoot somebody

1394
01:36:09,990 --> 01:36:12,870
- l don't have a gun
- Under the seat

1395
01:36:14,390 --> 01:36:16,270
lt's loaded and it works

1396
01:36:18,190 --> 01:36:20,660
Yeah, this'll do

1397
01:36:20,750 --> 01:36:24,060
Taken it to the range a couple of times
Kicks like a mule

1398
01:36:28,030 --> 01:36:33,110
Hartigan, there's so much
l've wanted to say to you

1399
01:36:33,190 --> 01:36:35,580
You've never been far from my thoughts

1400
01:36:35,670 --> 01:36:39,270
l've lain awake nights, thinking of you

1401
01:36:39,350 --> 01:36:41,990
What are you talking about?

1402
01:36:42,070 --> 01:36:46,590
Keep driving, Nancy
Keep driving and keep the car on the road

1403
01:36:49,230 --> 01:36:51,060
She's counting on you, old man

1404
01:36:51,150 --> 01:36:52,870
What are you doing?

1405
01:36:52,950 --> 01:36:55,340
Prove you're still worth a damn

1406
01:37:01,070 --> 01:37:03,590
Try and keep it on the road, Nancy

1407
01:37:06,190 --> 01:37:07,910
He's a decent shot

1408
01:37:07,990 --> 01:37:10,750
He's got skill,
but he's in too much of a hurry

1409
01:37:10,830 --> 01:37:13,710
Throwing away bullets
like they were candy

1410
01:37:17,590 --> 01:37:19,580
He doesn't know how to take his time

1411
01:37:19,670 --> 01:37:22,790
Aim careful and look the devil in the eye

1412
01:37:31,030 --> 01:37:33,150
Stop the car, Nancy
Gotta confirm the kill

1413
01:37:33,230 --> 01:37:35,270
- What?
- Stop the car, now

1414
01:37:35,350 --> 01:37:38,350
Right
Stop the car, confirm the kill

1415
01:37:44,630 --> 01:37:47,350
Sorry. l got a little rattled

1416
01:37:47,430 --> 01:37:51,670
lt's OK. You did great
Sit tight. l'll be right back

1417
01:37:51,750 --> 01:37:53,870
No. Let me stay close

1418
01:37:53,950 --> 01:37:56,310
Nothing can happen to me
when l'm with you

1419
01:37:56,390 --> 01:37:59,470
Please?
Let me stay close

1420
01:38:08,630 --> 01:38:12,340
The stink - l almost gag

1421
01:38:12,430 --> 01:38:14,260
His blood smells
even worse than he does

1422
01:38:14,350 --> 01:38:17,030
- Jesus
- And it's all over the place

1423
01:38:17,110 --> 01:38:21,630
But the creep himself, he's gone

1424
01:38:21,710 --> 01:38:23,670
We're out of time

1425
01:38:23,750 --> 01:38:27,950
The sirens - l used to welcome the sound

1426
01:38:28,510 --> 01:38:31,230
There's nothing to do now
but find a place to hole up for the night,

1427
01:38:31,310 --> 01:38:34,860
get Nancy calmed down, and figure out
what on Earth l'm going to do next

1428
01:38:34,950 --> 01:38:38,310
The stink - somehow it stays with us
all the way to the motel

1429
01:38:39,190 --> 01:38:41,150
Nancy, l went to your apartment

1430
01:38:41,230 --> 01:38:44,990
Your window was thrown wide open
The rooms looked almost empty

1431
01:38:45,070 --> 01:38:47,140
That's why l was sure
you'd been kidnapped

1432
01:38:47,230 --> 01:38:50,780
My window? Robbed again?
That's the third time this year

1433
01:38:50,870 --> 01:38:54,500
l swore if l ever saw you again,
l'd show you l grew up strong

1434
01:38:54,590 --> 01:38:57,980
But there l was, just like before,
scared and helpless

1435
01:38:58,070 --> 01:39:00,430
- l'm such an asshole
- You should sit down

1436
01:39:01,630 --> 01:39:04,470
You'll feel a little bit better if you sit down

1437
01:39:05,230 --> 01:39:07,300
l've never been all that good with people

1438
01:39:07,390 --> 01:39:10,670
When it comes to reassuring
a traumatised 19-year-old,

1439
01:39:10,750 --> 01:39:14,460
l'm as expert as a palsy victim
doing brain surgery with a pipe wrench

1440
01:39:14,550 --> 01:39:17,390
lt's always been you, Hartigan

1441
01:39:17,470 --> 01:39:19,350
All these years

1442
01:39:20,430 --> 01:39:22,900
lt's just nerves
making you say that, Nancy

1443
01:39:22,990 --> 01:39:26,140
You're just exhausted
You need to sleep

1444
01:39:26,230 --> 01:39:29,150
- Sleep with me
- Stop it, Nancy

1445
01:39:29,630 --> 01:39:31,670
Eight years

1446
01:39:31,750 --> 01:39:35,140
Why do you think
l kept writing you those letters?

1447
01:39:35,230 --> 01:39:37,380
lt wasn't just gratitude

1448
01:39:37,470 --> 01:39:40,430
l tried to fall in love with boys

1449
01:39:40,510 --> 01:39:42,660
Even thought l did once or twice

1450
01:39:42,750 --> 01:39:46,710
But l was already in love with you

1451
01:39:46,790 --> 01:39:49,310
That's enough
Jesus Christ

1452
01:39:49,390 --> 01:39:51,670
l'm old enough to be your grandfather

1453
01:39:51,750 --> 01:39:54,310
- You're just scared
- l'm not scared

1454
01:39:55,110 --> 01:39:56,710
No

1455
01:40:30,510 --> 01:40:33,430
There's wrong and there's wrong
and then there's this

1456
01:40:33,510 --> 01:40:36,030
For God's sakes, you're just a kid

1457
01:40:36,870 --> 01:40:38,910
l love you

1458
01:40:43,310 --> 01:40:45,780
l love you, too

1459
01:40:45,870 --> 01:40:47,670
With all my heart

1460
01:40:48,750 --> 01:40:51,830
Cold shower - it helps

1461
01:40:51,910 --> 01:40:53,230
No, Nancy

1462
01:40:56,510 --> 01:40:58,740
Recognise my voice, Hartigan?

1463
01:40:58,830 --> 01:41:02,460
Recognise my voice,
you piece of shit cop?

1464
01:41:02,550 --> 01:41:06,180
l look different,
but l bet you can recognise my voice

1465
01:41:06,270 --> 01:41:10,110
Sure
l recognise your voice, Junior

1466
01:41:13,110 --> 01:41:15,580
Everything's gone straight to hell

1467
01:41:15,670 --> 01:41:17,870
l've been suckered
into betraying the only friend l've got,

1468
01:41:17,950 --> 01:41:21,470
and put her in the hands of a murdering
rapist l thought l'd put down for good

1469
01:41:22,150 --> 01:41:25,590
Suckered by a spoiled brat
son of a senator

1470
01:41:25,670 --> 01:41:27,580
lt's all gone to hell

1471
01:41:27,670 --> 01:41:29,550
Klump, it's me

1472
01:41:29,630 --> 01:41:32,350
l got a dead man needs to be fetched

1473
01:41:32,430 --> 01:41:34,390
l want you to set me up for a party

1474
01:41:34,470 --> 01:41:36,670
l've already got the girl, you dumb shit

1475
01:41:36,750 --> 01:41:39,550
Hey, it better be perfect
or l'm calling my dad

1476
01:41:39,630 --> 01:41:42,190
My tools better be clean and sharp

1477
01:41:42,270 --> 01:41:44,830
lt better be ready
lt better be perfect

1478
01:41:46,630 --> 01:41:52,030
l get to do whatever l want,
however l want, whenever l want it

1479
01:41:52,470 --> 01:41:55,620
My dad - l'd love him if l didn't hate him

1480
01:41:55,710 --> 01:41:58,310
He spent a fortune
hiring every expert on the planet

1481
01:41:58,390 --> 01:42:01,510
to grow back that equipment
you blew off from between my legs,

1482
01:42:01,590 --> 01:42:05,630
just so the old fart can hold out
some kind of hope of having a grandkid

1483
01:42:05,710 --> 01:42:09,550
Although, as you can see,
there were some side effects

1484
01:42:09,630 --> 01:42:11,780
l'm not complaining, though
Since you've been gone,

1485
01:42:11,870 --> 01:42:13,510
l've been having the time of my life

1486
01:42:13,590 --> 01:42:16,870
And now you've led me back
to your darling Cordelia

1487
01:42:16,950 --> 01:42:19,020
We all wondered
who wrote all those letters

1488
01:42:19,110 --> 01:42:21,020
She left not a clue

1489
01:42:22,390 --> 01:42:25,540
Clever girl
And so pretty, so pretty

1490
01:42:28,070 --> 01:42:31,860
A little old for my taste,
but l can forgive that just this once

1491
01:42:31,950 --> 01:42:35,070
Nancy, don't scream

1492
01:42:35,150 --> 01:42:37,430
Whatever he does to you, don't scream

1493
01:42:37,510 --> 01:42:41,710
She'll scream. l'm gonna take
all night doing dear old Nancy

1494
01:42:41,790 --> 01:42:44,870
And you're gonna die knowing
that it's all your fault

1495
01:42:44,950 --> 01:42:47,670
They've all screamed, Hartigan

1496
01:42:47,750 --> 01:42:50,390
Dozens of them - maybe a hundred

1497
01:42:50,470 --> 01:42:53,350
Eight years' worth
Every one of them has screamed

1498
01:42:53,430 --> 01:42:55,630
And if there weren't
so many people hereabout,

1499
01:42:55,710 --> 01:42:59,550
l would show you how
l'm gonna make dear old Nancy scream

1500
01:42:59,630 --> 01:43:02,150
lt's gonna be one hell of a show

1501
01:43:10,910 --> 01:43:14,510
This is it
No way to fight it now

1502
01:43:14,590 --> 01:43:16,390
No hope left

1503
01:43:16,470 --> 01:43:18,300
No chance

1504
01:43:18,390 --> 01:43:21,990
This is it
This is the end

1505
01:43:24,550 --> 01:43:25,620
No

1506
01:43:26,190 --> 01:43:30,310
Give it a shot, old man
Keep your neck tight. Move

1507
01:43:30,390 --> 01:43:34,150
The window - maybe there's an alarm
The window

1508
01:43:34,230 --> 01:43:36,700
Keep your neck tight, goddamn it
Stay conscious

1509
01:43:36,790 --> 01:43:39,430
Stay conscious

1510
01:43:39,510 --> 01:43:40,710
No alarm

1511
01:43:40,790 --> 01:43:43,390
The glass. Cut the rope

1512
01:43:43,470 --> 01:43:46,150
You can do it
You can do it

1513
01:43:46,230 --> 01:43:47,990
lt is inclement upon me

1514
01:43:48,070 --> 01:43:52,110
to comment with marked displeasure
on your rash impulsiveness

1515
01:43:52,190 --> 01:43:58,630
in selecting such an eye-catching
and impractical car to heist, Mr Shlubb

1516
01:43:58,710 --> 01:44:04,350
lrrelevant to said mission is the following
query, which l now put forth to you

1517
01:44:04,750 --> 01:44:10,190
Wherein this most streamlined
and trunkless of transports -

1518
01:44:10,270 --> 01:44:12,830
boner-inspiring though it may be -

1519
01:44:12,910 --> 01:44:17,590
wherein are we to reposit
our recently deceased cargo?

1520
01:44:20,710 --> 01:44:24,070
l can only express puzzlement
that borders on alarm

1521
01:44:28,310 --> 01:44:32,020
Tell me where Roark takes the girls
or l'll cut your damn head off

1522
01:44:32,110 --> 01:44:33,670
ln plain English, creep

1523
01:44:33,750 --> 01:44:37,350
The answer you seek is rural,
even agrarian

1524
01:44:38,670 --> 01:44:40,710
The farm

1525
01:44:41,470 --> 01:44:44,310
That's all l need to hear
Every cop on the force

1526
01:44:44,390 --> 01:44:48,350
knows about the Roark family's farm
and to stay away from it

1527
01:44:48,430 --> 01:44:50,500
Shlubb and Klump
were packing an arsenal

1528
01:44:50,590 --> 01:44:53,590
Once things get loud,
l'll probably have use for the cannons

1529
01:44:53,670 --> 01:44:56,510
But at first, l'll have to play it quiet

1530
01:44:56,590 --> 01:44:58,790
Quiet and nasty

1531
01:44:59,230 --> 01:45:02,620
Nancy's car - six miles from the farm

1532
01:45:02,710 --> 01:45:05,670
''Nobody but me can keep
this heap running'', she told me

1533
01:45:05,750 --> 01:45:09,220
Good girl
The car stalled out on that yellow bastard

1534
01:45:09,310 --> 01:45:11,430
and you didn't tell him
how to start it up again

1535
01:45:11,510 --> 01:45:15,270
You kept your mouth shut
l'll bet Junior was furious

1536
01:45:15,350 --> 01:45:17,950
l'll bet he slapped you around
something fierce

1537
01:45:18,030 --> 01:45:21,820
But you stayed strong
You bought a few extra minutes

1538
01:45:21,910 --> 01:45:23,900
There's still a chance, Nancy

1539
01:45:23,990 --> 01:45:25,870
Don't scream

1540
01:45:26,910 --> 01:45:30,460
l ditch the car a mile or so from the farm
and make my way through the woods

1541
01:45:30,870 --> 01:45:34,310
l'm not halfway there when it hits

1542
01:45:35,190 --> 01:45:38,550
My heart
Can't be my heart

1543
01:45:38,630 --> 01:45:41,310
l was cured

1544
01:45:41,390 --> 01:45:44,310
Bad cough - blood in it

1545
01:45:44,910 --> 01:45:46,390
Doesn't matter now

1546
01:45:46,470 --> 01:45:49,550
l don't have to stay alive
that much longer, anyway

1547
01:45:53,950 --> 01:45:56,390
Rotten way to kill a man, but it's quiet

1548
01:46:02,150 --> 01:46:05,150
Hate yourself later

1549
01:46:16,190 --> 01:46:19,110
You're only making this worse for yourself,
you stupid cow

1550
01:46:27,830 --> 01:46:30,030
Do you think l'm tired?

1551
01:46:30,110 --> 01:46:32,230
ls that it?
Do you think l'm getting tired?

1552
01:46:32,310 --> 01:46:34,670
You're the one who's gonna crack

1553
01:46:34,750 --> 01:46:36,660
You'll crack

1554
01:46:36,750 --> 01:46:39,670
You'll cry and beg

1555
01:46:39,750 --> 01:46:41,350
You'll scream

1556
01:46:41,430 --> 01:46:45,900
Oh, yeah, you'll scream,
you big, fat, ugly cow

1557
01:46:45,990 --> 01:46:47,350
You'll scream

1558
01:46:52,830 --> 01:46:55,220
You're thinking the whip
was the worst l could do?

1559
01:46:55,910 --> 01:46:58,270
That was foreplay

1560
01:46:59,270 --> 01:47:02,070
Hartigan was right about you

1561
01:47:02,150 --> 01:47:04,590
You can't get it up unless l scream

1562
01:47:06,150 --> 01:47:07,790
You're pathetic

1563
01:47:09,110 --> 01:47:11,150
You're pathetic

1564
01:47:13,270 --> 01:47:16,270
lt's not wise at all
to make fun of me like that

1565
01:47:17,750 --> 01:47:20,030
lt brings out the worst in me

1566
01:47:26,470 --> 01:47:28,110
Stupid old man

1567
01:47:28,190 --> 01:47:30,310
ln too much of a hurry

1568
01:47:31,750 --> 01:47:34,550
Damn
lt can't be

1569
01:47:35,110 --> 01:47:38,390
Charging in like Galahad,
just like l told myself l wouldn't!

1570
01:47:38,470 --> 01:47:39,790
Stupid old man

1571
01:47:39,870 --> 01:47:43,950
- You tagged him good
- Don't take no chances. Perforate the fool

1572
01:47:48,430 --> 01:47:50,150
Good advice

1573
01:48:00,070 --> 01:48:02,060
Give it up, Junior

1574
01:48:02,150 --> 01:48:04,060
lt's over
Let her go

1575
01:48:04,150 --> 01:48:05,950
You're dreaming, Hartigan

1576
01:48:06,030 --> 01:48:10,740
l get to see your eyes while l fillet the
woman of your dreams right in front of you

1577
01:48:10,830 --> 01:48:13,750
Look at you
You're about to keel over

1578
01:48:13,830 --> 01:48:16,630
You can't even lift that cannon

1579
01:48:16,710 --> 01:48:18,830
Sure, l can

1580
01:48:25,470 --> 01:48:27,940
You gave me a scare there
for a second there, old man

1581
01:48:28,030 --> 01:48:31,030
Nancy, l'm sorry

1582
01:48:31,670 --> 01:48:34,310
l'm taking no chances with you

1583
01:48:36,790 --> 01:48:40,100
First l soften you up,
and then it's showtime

1584
01:48:43,190 --> 01:48:45,420
Here it comes

1585
01:48:47,070 --> 01:48:48,790
lt's gonna hurt

1586
01:48:48,870 --> 01:48:50,830
You're right about that

1587
01:48:54,550 --> 01:48:56,380
Sucker

1588
01:48:59,590 --> 01:49:01,270
l take away his weapon

1589
01:49:03,110 --> 01:49:04,510
Both of them

1590
01:49:15,750 --> 01:49:19,300
Eight long years, son of a bitch

1591
01:49:20,310 --> 01:49:24,100
After a while, all l'm doing is pounding
wet chunks of bone into the floorboards,

1592
01:49:24,190 --> 01:49:25,340
so l stop

1593
01:49:26,750 --> 01:49:29,220
So long, Junior

1594
01:49:29,310 --> 01:49:31,670
Been a pleasure

1595
01:49:36,870 --> 01:49:40,100
l didn't scream, Hartigan, not once

1596
01:49:41,550 --> 01:49:42,990
l didn't scream

1597
01:49:43,070 --> 01:49:45,190
l know it, baby

1598
01:49:45,270 --> 01:49:47,580
You grew up strong

1599
01:49:58,510 --> 01:50:01,790
By the time l get her to the car,
Nancy stops shaking

1600
01:50:01,870 --> 01:50:05,630
Her skin is warm again
She's herself again

1601
01:50:05,710 --> 01:50:07,990
Thanks for remembering my coat

1602
01:50:09,310 --> 01:50:11,350
And for all the little things

1603
01:50:11,950 --> 01:50:15,390
Like saving my life, twice

1604
01:50:16,350 --> 01:50:19,350
- You better get rolling
- You're not coming along?

1605
01:50:19,430 --> 01:50:24,140
No. l have friends on their way,
to collect evidence

1606
01:50:24,230 --> 01:50:26,830
l'm gonna blow
this whole sick mess wide open

1607
01:50:26,910 --> 01:50:28,980
l'm gonna clear my name

1608
01:50:29,070 --> 01:50:32,990
l'm gonna put Senator Roark
behind bars where he belongs

1609
01:50:33,070 --> 01:50:36,670
l can't lose you, not again

1610
01:50:38,830 --> 01:50:41,710
You'll never lose me, Nancy

1611
01:50:53,870 --> 01:50:57,660
Nancy Callahan, the love of my life

1612
01:50:58,870 --> 01:51:03,310
Shame to lie to her
l hope she forgives me for it

1613
01:51:03,390 --> 01:51:06,750
Get Senator Roark behind bars?
Sure

1614
01:51:06,830 --> 01:51:10,140
And maybe after l've pulled off
that miracle, l'll go and punch out God

1615
01:51:10,230 --> 01:51:14,020
There isn't a prosecutor in the state
who'll go after Senator Roark

1616
01:51:14,110 --> 01:51:16,020
l killed his only son

1617
01:51:16,110 --> 01:51:18,180
The bloodline is cut

1618
01:51:18,270 --> 01:51:20,910
Roark's lost his goddamn legacy

1619
01:51:21,150 --> 01:51:23,670
He'll use all his power
to get revenge on me

1620
01:51:23,750 --> 01:51:27,300
He'll go after me through Nancy
He'll find her again

1621
01:51:27,670 --> 01:51:29,660
There'll be no end to it

1622
01:51:29,750 --> 01:51:31,900
She'll never be safe

1623
01:51:31,990 --> 01:51:34,380
Not as long as l'm alive

1624
01:51:34,470 --> 01:51:37,110
There's only one way to beat him

1625
01:51:37,630 --> 01:51:40,100
An old man dies,

1626
01:51:40,190 --> 01:51:42,390
a young woman lives

1627
01:51:43,470 --> 01:51:45,670
Fair trade

1628
01:51:48,470 --> 01:51:51,270
l love you, Nancy

1629
01:51:57,950 --> 01:51:59,940
Yes

1630
01:52:00,030 --> 01:52:02,180
Mom, don't go on like that

1631
01:52:02,270 --> 01:52:07,220
lt's not the city. l could've gotten
in a traffic accident anywhere

1632
01:52:07,310 --> 01:52:10,700
Yeah, just a fracture
The doctor said it's a clean break

1633
01:52:10,790 --> 01:52:13,180
lt should be right as rain in no time

1634
01:52:31,630 --> 01:52:34,710
Turn the right corner in Sin City..

1635
01:52:34,790 --> 01:52:39,180
..and you can find anything.

1636
01:52:39,270 --> 01:52:40,870
Becky

1637
01:52:42,870 --> 01:52:45,390
Care for a smoke?

1638
01:52:47,350 --> 01:52:49,500
Love you, too, Mom

1639
01:52:52,630 --> 01:52:53,620
Anything
