Your past no longer exists.

165
00:14:03,344 --> 00:14:07,515
In exchange for your services,
I'm making you legal.

166

You don't have to sign anything,

00:14:09,058 --> 00:14:10,476
raise your right hand,
none of that shit.

168
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:12,395
I just stamp this bad motherfucker,

169
00:14:14,731 --> 00:14:17,608
and you are now an official

176

If you won't do this
for me, Machete,

177
00:14:45,386 --> 00:14:47,138
do it for her.

Thank you.

185
00:15:20,004 --> 00:15:21,506
What do I believe?

186
00:15:22,340 --> 00:15:24,550
I believe in the word "equality."

187
00:15:24,634 --> 00:15:26,552
I believe in a woman's
right to choose.

188
00:15:26,636 --> 00:15:27,678
Choose what?

189
00:15:27,762 --> 00:15:29,597
A snow cone, if that's what
she's in the mood for.

190
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:33,184
I believe in good barbecue, the
two-step, and the right to carry a gun.

191
00:15:33,267 --> 00:15:35,561
World peace? Sure, why not?

192
00:15:35,645 --> 00:15:37,522
But if we really wanna
talk about world peace,

193
00:15:37,605 --> 00:15:40,441
we have to start by tearing down that
wall that separates us from Mexico.

194
00:15:40,525 --> 00:15:42,485
That wall only
enables us to ignore

195
00:15:42,568 --> 00:15:44,570
the violence and injustice
that is occurring down there,

196
00:15:44,654 --> 00:15:48,950
thus making world peace nothing more
than a beauty pageant pipe dream.

197
00:15:49,575 --> 00:15:51,619
God bless Texas.

198
00:15:51,702 --> 00:15:52,954

MISS SAN ANTONIO: Fuck world peace.

00:16:52,471 --> 00:16:54,307
The M4 carbine long-range.

216
00:16:54,390 --> 00:16:59,061
It's got reflex sights, micro-polymer
grip, a customised trigger.

217
00:16:59,145 --> 00:17:00,938
Fast enough to nip a
jackrabbit on roller skates.

218
00:17:01,647 --> 00:17:02,982
That is, of course,

219
00:17:03,065 --> 00:17:05,484
you happen to come across a
jackrabbit on roller skates.

220
00:17:05,568 --> 00:17:08,613
Or, my personal
favourite, the grappler.

221
00:17:08,696 --> 00:17:10,698
Fires up to 30 yards.

222
00:17:10,781 --> 00:17:14,410
Good for when you gotta
scratch those hard to reach places.

I like this.

224

I like your style. Low-tech.

Tell me about Mendez.

229
00:17:32,762 --> 00:17:35,056
MISS SAN ANTONIO: Marcos Mendez
is the most sick and twisted

230
00:17:35,139 --> 00:17:37,225
fuckity-fox I've ever
had to keep tabs on.

231
00:17:37,308 --> 00:17:40,436
People down south call him
Marcos the Madman.

232
00:17:40,519 --> 00:17:42,355
He used to run with Los Cuerpos

233
00:17:42,438 --> 00:17:44,190
until one day he wakes up

234
00:17:44,273 --> 00:17:47,818
and decides he's gonna turn on the
cartel, fight for the people.

235
00:17:47,902 --> 00:17:49,904
We figure he's laired-up
in the jungle somewhere

236
00:17:49,987 --> 00:17:51,906
since our satellites
can't pinpoint him.

237
00:17:51,989 --> 00:17:55,368
Our only lead is this prizewinner,

238
00:17:55,451 --> 00:17:58,037
a working girl, goes
by the name of Cereza.

239
00:17:58,120 --> 00:17:59,747
Find her, find Mendez.

240
00:17:59,830 --> 00:18:01,832
- Where can I find her?
- In Acapulco.

241
00:18:01,916 --> 00:18:05,294
Her information, including the address
to her brothel, is in this dossier.

242
00:18:05,378 --> 00:18:06,796
Uh, uh, uh.

243
00:18:06,879 --> 00:18:09,966
First, I'm gonna need
something from you.

244
00:18:10,049 --> 00:18:12,885
See, even here, people
talk about Machete.

245
00:18:14,428 --> 00:18:15,513
The man.

246
00:18:17,390 --> 00:18:18,724
The myth.

247
00:18:20,101 --> 00:18:21,894
The legend.

248
00:18:21,978 --> 00:18:25,481
I just wanna know the
legend inside and out.

249
00:18:25,564 --> 00:18:27,692
I just lost someone.

250

Why don't you let me
turn that frown upside down, <i>Papi?</i>

251
00:19:10,109 --> 00:19:11,652
MISS SAN ANTONIO:
How long since you've been back?

252
00:19:11,777 --> 00:19:14,030
Since before the wall went up.

253
00:19:14,113 --> 00:19:15,906
A lot has changed since then.

254
00:19:15,990 --> 00:19:18,075
It's a run and gun
free-for-all out there.

255
00:19:18,159 --> 00:19:19,869
Acapulco is a war zone,

256
00:19:19,952 --> 00:19:21,662
and we're dropping you
right in the middle of it.

257
00:19:21,746 --> 00:19:24,915
Here.
It's a direct line to yours truly.

258
00:19:26,042 --> 00:19:28,461
You get into a pinch,
you just press pound to phone home.

259
00:19:28,544 --> 00:19:30,838
It's good for calls, texts, tweets.

260
00:19:30,921 --> 00:19:32,506
Machete don't tweet.

261
00:19:33,966 --> 00:19:35,509
You do now.

262
00:19:36,594 --> 00:19:37,678
You ready for this?

263
00:19:37,762 --> 00:19:39,180
Good luck on that pageant.

264
00:19:39,263 --> 00:19:40,681
I'm gonna need a lot
more than luck!

265
00:19:40,765 --> 00:19:42,600
Did you see the ass on
Miss Corpus Christi?

266
00:20:07,208 --> 00:20:08,459
All right.

267
00:20:08,542 --> 00:20:12,922
For all of you new girls,
it's peso-pussy Tuesday.

268
00:20:13,005 --> 00:20:18,427
So keep your panties dropped, your legs
spread and your snatch well-oiled,

269
00:20:18,511 --> 00:20:20,888
cos you're not walking any
straight lines tomorrow.

270
00:20:21,347 --> 00:20:22,556
As you know,

271
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:27,269
every jerk-off low-life
from this side of Rio Grande

272
00:20:27,353 --> 00:20:30,898
is gonna pile through that door as
soon as the sun comes down,

273
00:20:30,981 --> 00:20:34,985
so get them off and get them out.

274
00:20:35,069 --> 00:20:41,158
And, ladies, every stiff pecker
in my parlour pays to play.

275
00:20:41,450 --> 00:20:44,245
No freebies. Those are house rules.

Mendez is many things,
but merciful is not one of them.

The terrible things he did, he
did them for the greater good.
