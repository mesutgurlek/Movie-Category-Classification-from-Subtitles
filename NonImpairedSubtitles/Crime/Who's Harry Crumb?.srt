00:03:35,282 --> 00:03:39,342
Good morning. Crumb & Crumb
Detective Agency. Please hold.

3
00:03:39,422 --> 00:03:41,352
Yes, he'll be with you
in just a minute.

4
00:03:46,962 --> 00:03:48,892
Mr. and Mrs. Downing?

5
00:04:02,912 --> 00:04:05,242
- P.J.
- How are you, Eliot?

6
00:04:05,312 --> 00:04:06,742
Helen.

7
00:04:08,052 --> 00:04:09,642
You okay?

8
00:04:10,882 --> 00:04:12,972
We still haven't heard anything.

9
00:04:13,052 --> 00:04:15,922
Well, it only happened yesterday.

10
00:04:15,992 --> 00:04:18,012
The kidnappers are probably
as scared as you are.

11
00:04:18,092 --> 00:04:21,222
I don't care what they want.
I'll pay anything.

12
00:04:22,332 --> 00:04:24,162
You've alerted the police.

13
00:04:24,232 --> 00:04:26,702
Detective Casey's good,
very good.

14
00:04:26,762 --> 00:04:29,232
- We want you.
- Look...

15
00:04:29,302 --> 00:04:31,492
she's your daughter.

16
00:04:31,572 --> 00:04:34,562
I can understand your wanting to rely
on a private investigator...

17
00:04:34,642 --> 00:04:38,402
but I don't have anyone who can give it
the kind of attention it needs.

18
00:04:38,482 --> 00:04:40,472
It's not what
I want to hear, Eliot.

19
00:04:45,052 --> 00:04:48,812
There is one possibility.

20
00:04:51,562 --> 00:04:54,492
- Harry Crumb.
- Who's Harry Crumb?

21
00:04:54,562 --> 00:04:56,362
He is one of them.

22
00:04:56,432 --> 00:05:00,232
First, there was Augustus Crumb,
who founded the agency.

23
00:05:00,302 --> 00:05:03,702
Then there was his son,
Lionel Crumb...

24
00:05:03,772 --> 00:05:06,002
perhaps the most brilliant detective
of his time.

25
00:05:06,072 --> 00:05:08,872
It was Lionel-- God rest his soul--

26
00:05:08,942 --> 00:05:11,462
who entrusted me with the day-to-day
operations of Crumb & Crumb.

27
00:05:11,542 --> 00:05:16,912
- What about this Harry Crumb?
- Lionel's only offspring-- pure genius.

28
00:05:16,982 --> 00:05:21,042
He's been on special assignment
in the Midwest.

29
00:05:21,122 --> 00:05:24,022
I may have to pull some strings,
but I may be able to convince him.

30
00:05:24,092 --> 00:05:27,492
He's the last in a long line
of great detectives.

31
00:05:27,562 --> 00:05:29,082
He's good, huh?

32
00:05:29,162 --> 00:05:31,962
Oh, he's better than good.
He's a Crumb.

33
00:05:57,222 --> 00:05:58,652
Damn!

34
00:06:08,072 --> 00:06:10,002
Think, think, think.

35
00:06:27,222 --> 00:06:29,652
Yeah. Now I've got ya.

36
00:06:33,222 --> 00:06:34,662
Whoa!

37
00:06:39,062 --> 00:06:40,152
Help.

38
00:06:50,542 --> 00:06:53,812
Oh, yeah? lf you're not cheating on me,
whose socks are these?

39
00:06:53,882 --> 00:06:55,672
I've never seen those before.

40
00:06:55,752 --> 00:06:58,982
I get the feeling every time
I walk out that door...

41
00:06:59,052 --> 00:07:01,312
someone's gonna come in here
and take my place...

42
00:07:01,392 --> 00:07:03,442
sleep in my bed...

43
00:07:03,522 --> 00:07:05,182
and sit in my chair.

44
00:07:15,772 --> 00:07:17,202
Harry Crumb.

45
00:07:18,572 --> 00:07:20,302
It's for you.

46
00:07:29,382 --> 00:07:31,312
Hi. How ya doing?

47
00:07:32,582 --> 00:07:35,682
Nice to see you.
Nice people, very nice people.

48
00:07:38,492 --> 00:07:40,922
- Morning, Harry.
- Morning, Georgie.

49
00:07:43,762 --> 00:07:46,752
- Any calls yesterday?
- No, Harry.

50
00:07:46,832 --> 00:07:48,262
- How about today?
- No.

51
00:07:48,332 --> 00:07:50,932
But you do have a noon appointment
with Mrs. Macintyre.

52
00:07:51,002 --> 00:07:53,372
- Are the photos back from the lab?
- On your desk.

53
00:07:53,442 --> 00:07:55,672
- Satin finish?
- Glossies.

54
00:07:55,742 --> 00:07:57,932
Damn!
Noon appointment?

55
00:07:58,012 --> 00:07:59,272
That's right.

56
00:07:59,342 --> 00:08:01,282
Hold all my calls.

57
00:08:17,962 --> 00:08:21,692
"One who engages in love affairs
frivolously or casually."

58
00:08:30,942 --> 00:08:32,032
Yes?

59
00:08:32,112 --> 00:08:36,242
- Yes. Hello? Yes? Yeah?
- It's Mrs. Macintyre!

60
00:08:37,882 --> 00:08:39,212
Thank you.

61
00:08:40,522 --> 00:08:44,452
- Send her in.
- Okay, Harry!

62
00:08:55,172 --> 00:08:57,072
Mrs. Macintyre.

63
00:08:57,132 --> 00:09:00,762
Well, did you or didn't you
get the pictures?

64
00:09:01,972 --> 00:09:03,912
Did I get these pictures?

65
00:09:05,712 --> 00:09:08,272
The tough part is not
getting the pictures.

66
00:09:08,352 --> 00:09:11,112
The tough part is what you see...

67
00:09:11,182 --> 00:09:13,622
what you learn about people.

68
00:09:14,992 --> 00:09:16,452
Sad things.

69
00:09:16,522 --> 00:09:18,252
Is that tree diseased?

70
00:09:20,122 --> 00:09:23,582
- What are you talking about?
- There is, Mr. Crumb...

71
00:09:23,662 --> 00:09:27,032
a lot of money
riding on this divorce.

72
00:09:27,102 --> 00:09:30,262
Now, are you gonna show me
those pictures or not?

73
00:09:31,802 --> 00:09:33,792
There's some weird things going on
in these pictures.

74
00:09:34,702 --> 00:09:36,172
Sick things.

75
00:09:36,242 --> 00:09:39,112
That husband of yours--

76
00:09:39,182 --> 00:09:42,342
he's quite the, uh, philodendron.

77
00:09:42,412 --> 00:09:45,812
- Just give me those pictures.
- Sure.

78
00:09:52,092 --> 00:09:55,062
- You idiot!
- Hmm?

79
00:09:55,132 --> 00:09:58,532
These pictures are of me!

80
00:09:58,602 --> 00:10:00,362
What?

81
00:10:02,072 --> 00:10:04,002
Let me see those!

82
00:10:06,372 --> 00:10:08,302
Not so fast.

83
00:10:09,912 --> 00:10:12,242
I've had my eye on you
for a while, lady.

84
00:10:12,312 --> 00:10:15,072
I knew you were up to something.
Now here's my proof.

85
00:10:15,152 --> 00:10:17,742
It was you who were having an affair
with your husband all along.

86
00:10:17,812 --> 00:10:21,252
- What?
- I've uncovered low schemes before...

87
00:10:21,322 --> 00:10:23,582
but hiring me to take
pornographic pictures...

88
00:10:23,652 --> 00:10:26,182
of you and your sleaze ball husband
is as low as it gets.

89
00:10:26,262 --> 00:10:27,852
I don't believe this!

90
00:10:27,922 --> 00:10:30,592
Well, believe what you want,
but don't believe it here.

91
00:10:33,332 --> 00:10:37,102
You are a poor excuse
for a human being.

92
00:10:37,172 --> 00:10:38,662
Says you.

93
00:10:43,672 --> 00:10:45,112
Next.

94
00:10:47,342 --> 00:10:48,442
Boy--

95
00:11:01,292 --> 00:11:03,952
Crumb & Crumb,
serving greater Tulsa.

96
00:11:04,032 --> 00:11:08,362
Yes, he is. Who, may I ask, is calling?
One moment, please.

97
00:11:08,432 --> 00:11:10,592
It's the home office.

98
00:11:16,212 --> 00:11:19,302
Yes. Yes.

99
00:11:42,432 --> 00:11:44,992
- Cherry?
- No fruit, thank you.

100
00:11:51,642 --> 00:11:55,512
- Coke?
- No, thank you.

101
00:11:55,582 --> 00:11:57,672
Mix 'em together,
you got a Cherry Coke.

102
00:12:11,562 --> 00:12:12,992
Thanks.

103
00:12:55,912 --> 00:12:58,242
What the hell you doin'?
Open your eyes!

104
00:13:32,512 --> 00:13:34,442
I see you've been redecorating.

105
00:13:34,512 --> 00:13:36,672
Well, it's been ten years,
Mr. Crumb.

106
00:13:36,752 --> 00:13:38,512
I guess a lot's changed.

107
00:13:38,582 --> 00:13:41,412
Yes and no.

108
00:13:41,482 --> 00:13:42,712
Hmm?

109
00:13:42,792 --> 00:13:46,552
Would you like a mint?
I got them from the bus station.

110
00:13:46,622 --> 00:13:48,562
They're very good.

111
00:13:51,132 --> 00:13:52,752
No, thanks.

112
00:13:55,272 --> 00:13:58,762
- I'll show you to your office.
- Good.

113
00:14:29,232 --> 00:14:31,172
Sugar and spice

114
00:14:33,102 --> 00:14:35,942
So nice, so nice

115
00:14:36,012 --> 00:14:38,342
'Cause I got you

116
00:14:38,412 --> 00:14:40,502
Wow, and I feel good

117
00:14:42,112 --> 00:14:44,272
I knew that I would now

118
00:14:52,722 --> 00:14:55,452
So good, so good

119
00:14:55,532 --> 00:14:57,462
That I got you

120
00:15:40,472 --> 00:15:43,062
- Mr. Crumb?
- Yes?

121
00:15:44,742 --> 00:15:46,732
Okay, I'm coming.

122
00:15:46,812 --> 00:15:48,742
Mr. Crumb, are you there?

123
00:16:01,722 --> 00:16:04,252
- Yes?
- Mr. Draisen will see you now.

124
00:16:04,332 --> 00:16:05,762
Exactly.

125
00:16:07,302 --> 00:16:09,822
I really don't think
you'll run into any trouble.

126
00:16:09,902 --> 00:16:12,422
Just wanted a second opinion.

127
00:16:12,502 --> 00:16:14,442
- Yes?
- It's Harry Crumb.

128
00:16:14,502 --> 00:16:16,532
- Oh, send him in.
- Crumb?

129
00:16:16,612 --> 00:16:18,842
- You mean--
- That's right-- the Harry Crumb.

130
00:16:25,822 --> 00:16:29,112
By the shine of your suit, the cut of
your shoes and the look in your eye...

131
00:16:29,192 --> 00:16:30,852
you must be Eliot Draisen.

132
00:16:30,922 --> 00:16:33,082
No, I'm Draisen.

133
00:16:33,162 --> 00:16:35,652
Master of disguises, eh?

134
00:16:35,732 --> 00:16:38,252
Good, very good.

135
00:16:38,332 --> 00:16:41,202
Actually, Crumb, this is Jeffrey Brandt.
He's one of our top men.

136
00:16:41,262 --> 00:16:42,932
Exactly.

137
00:16:43,002 --> 00:16:44,932
Eliot tells me you share
my love of languages.

138
00:16:47,772 --> 00:16:50,762
"Do you prefer Chinese or Japanese?"

139
00:16:50,842 --> 00:16:52,642
"Ah, ha"

140
00:16:53,842 --> 00:16:57,902
"Obviously English is a problem too."

141
00:16:59,452 --> 00:17:00,442
"Sure, sure."

142
00:17:03,722 --> 00:17:07,592
Why don't you just check in
with me later, Jeff?

143
00:17:08,662 --> 00:17:10,592
I'll bring Crumb up to speed
on the Downing case.

144
00:17:13,632 --> 00:17:16,832
Crumb, do you know
what that is?

145
00:17:16,902 --> 00:17:19,962
- An egg?
- Yeah.

146
00:17:20,042 --> 00:17:23,532
- Well, what kind of egg?
- A bird egg?

147
00:17:26,082 --> 00:17:28,202
It's a pterodactyl egg.

148
00:17:28,282 --> 00:17:30,042
It's fossilized.

149
00:17:30,112 --> 00:17:33,712
It's 90 million years old.

150
00:17:33,782 --> 00:17:38,022
In the entire world,
only two of these have ever been found.

151
00:17:38,092 --> 00:17:40,152
You know, that may be
worth something.

152
00:17:43,132 --> 00:17:46,862
- That thought had crossed my mind.
- We think a lot alike.

153
00:17:46,932 --> 00:17:48,862
I like a man
who thinks like me.

154
00:17:48,932 --> 00:17:51,022
Did you bring your copy
of the Downing file?

155
00:17:51,102 --> 00:17:53,762
No need to.
I've committed it to memory.

156
00:17:55,942 --> 00:17:58,202
At 10:45, on the morning
of June 11...

157
00:17:58,272 --> 00:18:02,802
Jennifer Downing was abducted
from room three at Suki's...

158
00:18:02,882 --> 00:18:05,042
1225 North Rodeo Drive.

159
00:18:05,112 --> 00:18:08,982
Her assailant chloroformed Ms. Downing's
attendant, Marie Cannell...

160
00:18:09,052 --> 00:18:11,712
and, it's suspected,
did the same to Ms. Downing.

161
00:18:11,792 --> 00:18:14,812
A laundry cart was found
in the rear parking lot.

162
00:18:14,892 --> 00:18:17,192
Traces of chloroform were present.

163
00:18:17,262 --> 00:18:19,492
This, no doubt,
was their means of escape.

164
00:18:19,562 --> 00:18:22,552
Still one thing puzzles me.

165
00:18:24,632 --> 00:18:27,192
There was not one single mention
of the stolen jewels.

166
00:18:28,572 --> 00:18:30,662
There aren't any jewels.
This is a kidnapping.

167
00:18:32,742 --> 00:18:34,682
Just kidding.

168
00:18:36,712 --> 00:18:38,652
I gotta go.

169
00:18:47,922 --> 00:18:49,552
- Hello?
- How's our girl?

170
00:18:49,632 --> 00:18:54,292
Oh, she's nice, Mr. D.,
real nice.

171
00:18:54,362 --> 00:18:57,302
I have to tell you one thing, Dwayne.
We're in better shape than we thought.

172
00:18:57,372 --> 00:18:58,892
Yeah?

173
00:18:58,972 --> 00:19:01,442
- That guy Crumb I told you about--
- Yeah?

174
00:19:01,502 --> 00:19:05,532
I was right. The man's
a complete and utter idiot.

175
00:19:07,542 --> 00:19:10,242
This is excellent.

176
00:19:10,312 --> 00:19:14,252
This is just plain
old-fashioned excellent.

177
00:20:29,062 --> 00:20:33,292
Would you mind taking your free hand
off the doorbell?

178
00:20:33,362 --> 00:20:35,422
Sorry.
Bit of an accident.

179
00:20:35,502 --> 00:20:38,522
- You Crumb?
- You know who I am?

180
00:20:38,602 --> 00:20:40,692
That's right.
Your cover's blown.

181
00:20:40,772 --> 00:20:43,002
- My dad's upstairs.
- So, you'd have me believe...

182
00:20:43,072 --> 00:20:46,272
you're P.J. Downing's
daughter, huh?

183
00:20:46,342 --> 00:20:47,602
Impossible.

184
00:20:52,952 --> 00:20:57,442
I happen to know that P.J. Downing's
daughter was kidnapped 72 hours ago.

185
00:20:57,522 --> 00:20:59,952
I'm Nikki, the other daughter.

186
00:21:00,022 --> 00:21:02,582
Of course you are.
It's just that I was told...

187
00:21:02,662 --> 00:21:05,492
that P.J. Downing's daughter
was a beautiful young woman...

188
00:21:05,562 --> 00:21:07,152
so I momentarily
mistook her for you.

189
00:21:08,632 --> 00:21:10,062
What a schmooze.

190
00:21:10,132 --> 00:21:13,402
Yes, it is Jennifer Downing
I'm here to find.

191
00:21:15,142 --> 00:21:17,072
And find her...

192
00:21:18,412 --> 00:21:19,502
I will.

193
00:21:19,582 --> 00:21:21,412
You get paid for this?

194
00:21:21,482 --> 00:21:24,342
- Usually, yeah.
- Mr. Crumb...

195
00:21:25,452 --> 00:21:26,882
so nice to meet you.

196
00:21:26,952 --> 00:21:28,782
- And you must be--
- Helen Downing.

197
00:21:28,852 --> 00:21:30,322
And then some.

198
00:21:30,392 --> 00:21:32,852
Off to play tennis again?

199
00:21:33,992 --> 00:21:37,022
As you can imagine,
these are trying times.

200
00:21:37,092 --> 00:21:39,222
We do what we can
to get through them.

201
00:21:39,302 --> 00:21:41,662
But we don't have to enjoy it.

202
00:21:44,002 --> 00:21:45,432
Kids.

203
00:21:48,572 --> 00:21:50,002
Bitch.

204
00:21:53,282 --> 00:21:56,912
I think it's time
I see your father now.

205
00:21:56,982 --> 00:21:58,412
Hey, Dad!

206
00:21:59,482 --> 00:22:01,512
Mr. Downing.

207
00:22:01,582 --> 00:22:04,252
Oh, Harry Crumb.
It's nice to--

208
00:22:04,322 --> 00:22:06,522
Please, sit down.
Continue what you're doing.

209
00:22:06,592 --> 00:22:08,352
Thank you.

210
00:22:08,422 --> 00:22:11,952
Ordinarily, this is
one of my great pleasures.

211
00:22:13,802 --> 00:22:17,962
Today, it's just a way
to keep my mind off Jennifer.

212
00:22:18,032 --> 00:22:19,592
A sad situation.

213
00:22:19,672 --> 00:22:22,302
Kidnappings always are.

214
00:22:22,372 --> 00:22:24,312
But they are less sad to me...

215
00:22:24,372 --> 00:22:27,772
because I have yet to meet
a kidnapper I could not outwit.

216
00:22:27,842 --> 00:22:30,072
Eliot Draisen says
you're the best.

217
00:22:30,152 --> 00:22:33,712
Indeed, he sounds
like a smart man.

218
00:22:33,782 --> 00:22:35,722
I'd like to meet him someday.

219
00:22:35,792 --> 00:22:37,252
Didn't he send you here?

220
00:22:38,822 --> 00:22:40,352
Exactly.

221
00:22:40,422 --> 00:22:44,482
- Isn't that a marabou muddler?
- Yes. Are you a fly fisherman?

222
00:22:44,562 --> 00:22:48,162
Fishing is my life.

223
00:22:48,232 --> 00:22:51,672
There's a feeling
between man and fish...

224
00:22:51,732 --> 00:22:54,232
a bond...

225
00:22:54,302 --> 00:22:59,612
an intimate connection
between fish and fisherman.

226
00:22:59,682 --> 00:23:03,172
A special understanding.

227
00:23:03,252 --> 00:23:05,582
You know, the whole
fish/man thing.

228
00:23:12,862 --> 00:23:15,952
I was thinking this morning
about the kidnappers.

229
00:23:17,192 --> 00:23:20,692
About how much more respect...

230
00:23:20,762 --> 00:23:22,862
a sportsman has
for his quarry.

231
00:23:27,242 --> 00:23:28,762
Exactly.

232
00:23:32,112 --> 00:23:33,872
I'd do anything
to get her back.

233
00:23:42,522 --> 00:23:47,352
Money means nothing, Mr. Crumb,
when it comes to your own child.

234
00:23:47,422 --> 00:23:50,452
Yes, I met Nikki
on the way in.

235
00:23:51,992 --> 00:23:57,022
Oh, she's wonderful, but Jennifer was
my first little girl.

236
00:24:01,442 --> 00:24:04,002
- Nice fish-- very big.
- Thank you.

237
00:24:05,472 --> 00:24:07,412
And what have we here?
Well--

238
00:24:09,812 --> 00:24:11,072
A real beauty.

239
00:24:11,152 --> 00:24:13,672
You certainly know
your bamboo.

240
00:24:14,622 --> 00:24:17,882
Bamboo is my business.

241
00:24:17,952 --> 00:24:22,122
And it's my business to know
what no one else wants to know.

242
00:24:22,192 --> 00:24:24,662
That is the very business
I'm in.

243
00:24:41,142 --> 00:24:44,372
- You all right, Mr. Crumb?
- Yes, I'm fine.

244
00:24:47,852 --> 00:24:49,612
The girl's mother--

245
00:24:49,692 --> 00:24:51,652
how is she holding up?

246
00:24:51,722 --> 00:24:53,952
She's their stepmother, actually.

247
00:24:54,022 --> 00:24:59,892
We married a couple of years ago
in a moment of weakness, perhaps.

248
00:24:59,962 --> 00:25:03,192
She's a very attractive woman...

249
00:25:03,272 --> 00:25:07,902
but to tell you the truth, she and
the girls have never been that close.

250
00:25:07,972 --> 00:25:10,202
- You know how it is.
- Yes...

251
00:25:10,272 --> 00:25:13,212
I know the score of that game--

252
00:25:14,282 --> 00:25:16,372
40-love.

253
00:25:17,112 --> 00:25:19,812
- Excuse me?
- I was just thinking, Mr. Downing...

254
00:25:19,882 --> 00:25:24,982
I must become more familiar
with these kidnappers.

255
00:25:26,292 --> 00:25:29,782
I must understand them.

256
00:25:31,792 --> 00:25:34,592
I must think like them.

257
00:25:35,802 --> 00:25:38,732
I must go to the scene
of the crime.

258
00:25:49,412 --> 00:25:52,352
- Good day to you, sir.
- Good day.

259
00:26:05,592 --> 00:26:07,622
We'll see you then.
Bye-bye.

260
00:26:09,572 --> 00:26:12,262
I'm sorry.
What did you say your name was?

261
00:26:12,332 --> 00:26:15,462
I am Deszu Djizlas.

262
00:26:15,542 --> 00:26:20,132
- Could you spell that please?
- I don't think so. Try it with a "D."

263
00:26:20,212 --> 00:26:22,912
- You say you're from New York?
- No, I work in New York.

264
00:26:22,982 --> 00:26:24,972
- I'm from Budapest.
- Oh, Hungary.

265
00:26:25,052 --> 00:26:27,982
No, thank you.
I had a falafel before I got here.

266
00:26:28,052 --> 00:26:29,982
I'm sorry,
that's not what I meant.

267
00:26:30,052 --> 00:26:32,252
- Mr. D--
- Djizlas.

268
00:26:32,322 --> 00:26:34,262
- I'm Dennis Kimball.
- Dennis Kimball.

269
00:26:34,322 --> 00:26:36,812
Yes. I just heard
you were coming.

270
00:26:36,892 --> 00:26:38,992
Yes. Well, I'm here.

271
00:26:39,062 --> 00:26:41,832
- He's our vice president of operations.
- Quality control!

272
00:26:41,902 --> 00:26:44,302
Yes, that's very important
to us here.

273
00:26:44,372 --> 00:26:46,462
So you say.

274
00:26:47,402 --> 00:26:49,132
Move it, Kimball.
Come on.

275
00:26:49,202 --> 00:26:51,142
Move, Dennis.

276
00:26:56,252 --> 00:26:58,182
So, what have we here?

277
00:26:59,052 --> 00:27:00,482
Too tight.

278
00:27:02,322 --> 00:27:03,752
Too loose.

279
00:27:05,392 --> 00:27:07,222
Too foofy.

280
00:27:07,292 --> 00:27:10,492
- You don't like what you see?
- Only I am the judge of that.

281
00:27:10,562 --> 00:27:12,582
- Of course.
- Of course.

282
00:27:21,272 --> 00:27:24,762
The full-body mud pack is
one of our most popular treatments.

283
00:27:24,842 --> 00:27:28,782
It tightens the pores
and rejuvenates the dermis.

284
00:27:28,842 --> 00:27:31,242
Indulge me.
I will be you.

285
00:27:31,312 --> 00:27:35,222
You will be the intruder. Show to me
exactly how it happened, please.

286
00:27:35,282 --> 00:27:39,882
Well, he must have been
standing here...

287
00:27:39,962 --> 00:27:41,892
just in back of me.

288
00:27:42,792 --> 00:27:45,352
And you were applying
the mud like so.

289
00:27:46,102 --> 00:27:47,692
He didn't make a sound.

290
00:27:47,762 --> 00:27:50,892
- And you were leaning over like this?
- Yes.

291
00:27:50,972 --> 00:27:53,902
That's correct.
Suddenly he leapt out at me.

292
00:27:57,312 --> 00:27:59,802
So, it was not as easy
as you said.

293
00:27:59,882 --> 00:28:03,072
But you knew what I was doing.
That's funny.

294
00:28:03,152 --> 00:28:05,082
You look different somehow.

295
00:28:06,322 --> 00:28:08,722
Maybe your eyes
are playing tricks on me.

296
00:28:14,822 --> 00:28:16,262
So...

297
00:28:17,262 --> 00:28:21,422
you always give Miss Downing
her mud pack?

298
00:28:21,502 --> 00:28:25,562
- Well, no, it was her first time.
- Oh, really?

299
00:28:25,632 --> 00:28:29,262
Are you saying she doesn't have
a regular weekly appointment?

300
00:28:29,342 --> 00:28:33,272
No, that was her mother,
and it was Mrs. Downing's regular time.

301
00:28:34,012 --> 00:28:35,572
Of course.

302
00:28:35,642 --> 00:28:39,672
She had given to her daughter
her regular appointment.

303
00:28:39,752 --> 00:28:40,842
I guess she did.

304
00:28:40,922 --> 00:28:45,912
One could say that Mrs. Downing knew
precisely where her daughter would be.

305
00:28:56,002 --> 00:28:57,992
A sneaky player.

306
00:28:58,072 --> 00:29:01,332
Very good. Okay.

307
00:29:23,862 --> 00:29:27,322
- They won't really kill her, will they?
- Of course not.

308
00:29:27,402 --> 00:29:29,492
That's why Mr. Crumb's here.

309
00:29:30,732 --> 00:29:32,172
God!

310
00:29:33,802 --> 00:29:35,772
Great.

311
00:29:35,842 --> 00:29:37,902
I'll see you later.

312
00:29:41,882 --> 00:29:45,142
Helen should know about this.
Tim.

313
00:29:45,212 --> 00:29:47,652
Do you know
where Mrs. Downing is?

314
00:29:50,922 --> 00:29:54,322
Well, what happens if I do?

315
00:29:54,392 --> 00:29:56,692
That's all right.
I'll find her.

316
00:29:56,762 --> 00:29:59,232
Thank you, God.

317
00:29:59,292 --> 00:30:02,422
Thank you, Eliot. She's probably
down by the stables.

318
00:30:02,502 --> 00:30:04,432
Yes, thank you, Eliot.

319
00:30:05,602 --> 00:30:07,192
Good man.

320
00:30:10,512 --> 00:30:11,942
What do you think?

321
00:30:12,842 --> 00:30:15,942
One size fits all--
who are they kidding?

322
00:30:22,582 --> 00:30:24,782
- Would you mind?
- No, of course not.

323
00:30:36,972 --> 00:30:41,402
Detective Casey.
I'd like you to meet Harry Crumb.

324
00:30:44,472 --> 00:30:47,972
- I know you by reputation.
- My reputation precedes me.

325
00:30:48,042 --> 00:30:50,412
Otherwise, I'd be late
for all my appointments.

326
00:30:56,892 --> 00:30:59,552
You know, Mr. Downing...

327
00:30:59,622 --> 00:31:02,112
I have a lot of experience
in these matters...

328
00:31:02,192 --> 00:31:06,252
and over the years, I've developed
a theory about private detectives.

329
00:31:06,332 --> 00:31:08,352
They're slime,
and without exception...

330
00:31:08,432 --> 00:31:11,992
they are lazy, stupid,
cowardly, arrogant...

331
00:31:12,072 --> 00:31:14,002
and thoroughly incompetent.

332
00:31:16,872 --> 00:31:18,462
It's just a theory.

333
00:31:19,912 --> 00:31:21,572
There it is.

334
00:31:21,642 --> 00:31:24,742
And make sure the lab has the number
here in case they come up with anything.

335
00:31:27,382 --> 00:31:30,752
You can have your lab inspect
this note as much as you want...

336
00:31:30,822 --> 00:31:34,852
but they may never discover
what I already know.

337
00:31:34,922 --> 00:31:36,862
And what is that, Mr. Crumb?

338
00:31:40,102 --> 00:31:44,122
You find that crazy typewriter,
and you'll have your kidnappers.

339
00:31:52,882 --> 00:31:57,312
The ransom note arrived.
They want ten million.

340
00:31:59,752 --> 00:32:01,182
My God.

341
00:32:03,392 --> 00:32:05,322
They'll suck him dry.

342
00:32:09,732 --> 00:32:11,662
He wants to see you.

343
00:32:14,462 --> 00:32:16,562
Listen, I know you're not happy.
I can make you happy.

344
00:32:16,632 --> 00:32:21,072
Really? Stop it!
You make me sick.

345
00:32:23,642 --> 00:32:27,582
-You haven't changed since night school.
-I loved you then, and I still do.

346
00:32:27,642 --> 00:32:30,042
I'll tell you what--

347
00:32:30,112 --> 00:32:34,052
Back then, dinner and a movie might've
gotten you into some girl's panties.

348
00:32:35,382 --> 00:32:40,912
But it's going to take a lot more
than that to get into mine.

349
00:32:47,502 --> 00:32:48,762
What do you want?

350
00:32:48,832 --> 00:32:50,762
Don't you know?

351
00:32:54,072 --> 00:32:55,502
Money.

352
00:32:56,512 --> 00:32:58,102
Lots of money.

353
00:33:05,682 --> 00:33:07,622
I'm working on it.

354
00:33:09,082 --> 00:33:12,782
You see, P.J., I believe
that there's the criminal body...

355
00:33:12,852 --> 00:33:14,792
and the criminal mind.

356
00:33:16,162 --> 00:33:20,062
Each are separate from each other
in that the criminal body--

357
00:33:20,132 --> 00:33:23,362
although it's a criminal,
doesn't know exactly what it's doing--

358
00:33:23,432 --> 00:33:26,462
will commit the crime,
unwittingly, if you will.

359
00:33:26,542 --> 00:33:29,802
The criminal mind knows exactly
what it's doing.

360
00:33:29,872 --> 00:33:33,242
A mind that is brazen,
yet cowardly.

361
00:33:33,312 --> 00:33:36,942
Nimble, yet clumsy.
Cunning, yet naive.

362
00:33:37,012 --> 00:33:38,542
- Zealous--
- Would you get to the point!

363
00:33:39,452 --> 00:33:40,542
You first.

364
00:33:41,822 --> 00:33:46,882
It makes me wonder if the criminal mind
is actually human at all.

365
00:33:46,962 --> 00:33:51,362
I believe that there's a reason
mankind has been lifted...

366
00:33:51,432 --> 00:33:54,122
beyond the level of the animals.

367
00:33:54,202 --> 00:33:56,892
Human nature is...

368
00:33:56,972 --> 00:33:58,932
man's greatest triumph...

369
00:33:59,002 --> 00:34:01,562
but also the source
of his undoing.

370
00:34:03,142 --> 00:34:06,772
We all aspire
to our noblest instincts...

371
00:34:06,842 --> 00:34:11,182
and yet, all too often,
we indulge our basest desires.

372
00:34:14,482 --> 00:34:17,782
Just like those animals
that took our Jennifer.

373
00:34:17,852 --> 00:34:20,982
Yes.
They're animals all right.

374
00:34:21,062 --> 00:34:22,992
But have no fear.

375
00:34:24,762 --> 00:34:27,792
The kidnappers
will not harm your daughter...

376
00:34:29,532 --> 00:34:33,632
not while I'm nipping
at their heels.

377
00:34:33,702 --> 00:34:36,032
Do you think these people imagine...

378
00:34:36,102 --> 00:34:38,942
that they are going to get
what they want?

379
00:34:39,012 --> 00:34:42,972
I wonder if it's ever occurred
to Mr. Crumb...

380
00:34:43,052 --> 00:34:46,672
that there may be things going on
of which he is totally...

381
00:34:46,752 --> 00:34:49,982
perhaps blissfully, unaware.

382
00:34:51,452 --> 00:34:55,482
Unfortunately, people don't always
do what we expect them to.

383
00:34:55,562 --> 00:34:58,392
Not criminals.
Not anyone.

384
00:35:00,902 --> 00:35:01,992
Mr. Draisen.

385
00:35:03,602 --> 00:35:05,662
I don't know what you thought
I was talking about...

386
00:35:05,732 --> 00:35:08,832
but I would hope you could keep things
on a professional level.

387
00:35:10,112 --> 00:35:12,342
- What?
- Please. These things...

388
00:35:12,412 --> 00:35:15,842
can be so easily misinterpreted.

389
00:35:15,912 --> 00:35:19,682
I think this is a good time
for coffee.

390
00:35:19,752 --> 00:35:25,082
Oh, great. Now I suppose
everyone will want some.

391
00:35:51,512 --> 00:35:54,282
Oh, geez, I hope that wasn't
as old as it looked.

392
00:35:55,082 --> 00:35:56,522
Sorry.

393
00:35:57,622 --> 00:35:59,712
Hello, Nikki.

394
00:35:59,792 --> 00:36:02,222
You mind if I look around?

395
00:36:02,962 --> 00:36:04,392
Thank you.

396
00:36:07,132 --> 00:36:09,262
It's no wonder they took her, huh?

397
00:36:09,332 --> 00:36:13,862
Do you know that when she was 14
she was so skinny everybody worried...

398
00:36:13,942 --> 00:36:17,102
that she looked like a newt.

399
00:36:17,172 --> 00:36:20,872
And now, I mean, just look at her.
She's perfect.

400
00:36:22,912 --> 00:36:24,342
Perfect?

401
00:36:26,452 --> 00:36:31,582
I don't know. Look at the size
of her head. She must be enormous.

402
00:36:32,852 --> 00:36:34,792
Be easy to find...

403
00:36:35,522 --> 00:36:37,252
'cause she's huge.

404
00:36:39,902 --> 00:36:41,992
- Lecithin.
- Lecithin.

405
00:36:44,232 --> 00:36:46,172
Scrod oil.

406
00:36:49,702 --> 00:36:51,002
Scrod oil?

407
00:36:51,072 --> 00:36:53,772
Improves slow-twitch
muscle response.

408
00:36:53,842 --> 00:36:55,612
I always thought
pancakes were good for that.

409
00:36:55,682 --> 00:36:57,872
Jennifer taught me
how to make this drink.

410
00:36:57,952 --> 00:37:00,472
She tells me that's what gives you
that amazing figure.

411
00:37:00,552 --> 00:37:02,682
Of course, the mileage may vary.

412
00:37:07,592 --> 00:37:10,582
You know, it would appear
your mother is--

413
00:37:10,662 --> 00:37:12,632
- She's not my mother!
- Okay.

414
00:37:12,692 --> 00:37:15,492
All she wants is Dad's money.
Money and sex. She's a nympho.

415
00:37:18,202 --> 00:37:20,602
She's gotta have it constantly--
four or five times a day.

416
00:37:24,872 --> 00:37:27,902
That's why she's going out
with that scumball, Vince.

417
00:37:27,982 --> 00:37:30,842
What a sleaze.

418
00:37:32,852 --> 00:37:36,652
It would appear that your stepmother
presents something of a puzzle to me.

419
00:37:36,722 --> 00:37:38,952
I thought maybe you'd like
to lend a hand.

420
00:37:39,022 --> 00:37:41,352
- Like what, spying?
- No, not like spying.

421
00:37:41,422 --> 00:37:44,862
Mote like perception
or observation.

422
00:37:44,932 --> 00:37:47,492
- Like spying.
- Like spying, yes.

423
00:37:48,562 --> 00:37:51,002
I just wish they would've kidnapped
the old cow instead.

424
00:37:51,072 --> 00:37:55,632
Hmm. Well, the truth is, Nikki,
the kidnappers had a very good reason...

425
00:37:55,702 --> 00:37:59,332
- not to take your stepmother.
- What's that?

426
00:37:59,412 --> 00:38:02,402
One cannot kidnap oneself.

427
00:38:09,552 --> 00:38:11,612
I wish we could hear
what they were saying.

428
00:38:11,692 --> 00:38:15,282
No need to hear. I've been trained
in the art of reading lips.

429
00:38:15,362 --> 00:38:17,832
Every word they say, I see.

430
00:38:22,362 --> 00:38:24,732
Goddamnit it, Vince,
I am suffering here.

431
00:38:24,802 --> 00:38:28,172
It has taken me almost two years
to get him to write me into the will.

432
00:38:28,242 --> 00:38:31,102
Then we spend another six months coming
up with a perfect plan to kill him.

433
00:38:31,172 --> 00:38:34,702
And what's it all come to?
Some kidnappers are gonna get it all.

434
00:38:36,042 --> 00:38:38,272
- Don't get so steamed.
- If we do not kill him now...

435
00:38:38,352 --> 00:38:41,842
he is probably gonna pay those bastards
every penny they want.

436
00:38:41,922 --> 00:38:45,282
There'll be nothing left--
the house, the cars, the stocks.

437
00:38:47,262 --> 00:38:48,692
That's my money.

438
00:38:51,192 --> 00:38:52,632
Our money.

439
00:38:52,692 --> 00:38:55,532
Look, we can get
into his car whenever you want.

440
00:38:55,602 --> 00:38:58,532
You wanna do it tonight,
we'll do it tonight, okay?

441
00:38:59,802 --> 00:39:01,232
Tonight?

442
00:39:01,302 --> 00:39:02,902
Did they do it or not?

443
00:39:02,972 --> 00:39:07,242
They're the kidnappers. We've got them
right where we want them.

444
00:39:07,312 --> 00:39:10,302
What do you mean? We have no idea
where they're keeping Jennifer.

445
00:39:10,382 --> 00:39:12,572
One thing we can be thankful for is...

446
00:39:12,652 --> 00:39:16,672
that they signed that idiot Crumb
to the case.

447
00:39:16,752 --> 00:39:18,882
You don't think
he suspects anything, do you?

448
00:39:18,952 --> 00:39:23,722
No, I think he suspects he has a dick,
but he'd need a road map to find it.

449
00:39:23,792 --> 00:39:26,522
I don't mean to be boastful...

450
00:39:26,592 --> 00:39:29,932
but they're discussing my prowess
as a private dick.

451
00:39:38,972 --> 00:39:40,802
Crumb, are you okay?

452
00:39:40,882 --> 00:39:44,282
Don't worry, Nikki.
I've got a firm grip.

453
00:39:44,352 --> 00:39:46,442
Everything will be just fine.

454
00:40:27,962 --> 00:40:29,792
Kid, where you going?

455
00:41:37,462 --> 00:41:40,122
I thought you said you could do this
with your eyes closed.

456
00:41:41,802 --> 00:41:44,032
- Shit.
- What now?

457
00:41:44,832 --> 00:41:47,172
I just paid 34.50
for this shirt...

458
00:41:47,242 --> 00:41:49,602
and that's with
my pro shop discount.

459
00:41:49,672 --> 00:41:52,272
I hate it when you talk cheap.

460
00:41:58,052 --> 00:42:01,212
Is that it?
No brakes at all?

461
00:42:01,282 --> 00:42:06,152
Better. Pressure's good for regular
driving, but once they hit the hills--

462
00:42:06,222 --> 00:42:08,782
No more Freddy the Fisherman.

463
00:42:08,862 --> 00:42:10,292
You bet.

464
00:42:12,132 --> 00:42:15,392
Stop.
I like you dirty.

465
00:42:28,012 --> 00:42:31,782
Say something sexy, you animal.

466
00:42:45,632 --> 00:42:48,062
I gotta check in
with the mister.

467
00:42:49,562 --> 00:42:52,622
He cares about you
almost as much as I do.

468
00:42:53,872 --> 00:42:55,932
- Hello?
- How we doing, boss man?

469
00:42:56,002 --> 00:43:01,172
- Fine. How's your house guest?
- She's a little shy.

470
00:43:01,242 --> 00:43:03,182
But I can tell she likes me.

471
00:43:03,242 --> 00:43:05,182
You'll get your chance.

472
00:43:05,252 --> 00:43:08,372
Just control yourself till the check's
in the mail, so to speak.

473
00:43:08,452 --> 00:43:11,482
- Damn it, Draisen, you said--
- Dwayne, you'll get what you want...

474
00:43:11,552 --> 00:43:15,512
when I get what I want,
understood?

475
00:43:15,592 --> 00:43:19,252
- All right.
- Sorry, sorry.

476
00:43:19,332 --> 00:43:22,262
Yeah. Just stay there
till Dobson gets there.

477
00:43:26,232 --> 00:43:28,672
I have identified the kidnapper.

478
00:43:33,242 --> 00:43:36,212
- Do tell.
- Brace yourself.

479
00:43:36,282 --> 00:43:38,212
You may find this
very hard to believe...

480
00:43:38,282 --> 00:43:42,012
but the kidnapper is
none other than...

481
00:43:45,222 --> 00:43:46,412
Helen Downing.

482
00:43:49,262 --> 00:43:51,522
That hoes come as
somewhat a surprise to me.

483
00:43:51,592 --> 00:43:56,262
I thought it would. But that is why
you hired me in the first place.

484
00:43:56,332 --> 00:43:59,432
- Isn't it?
- You're right about that.

485
00:43:59,502 --> 00:44:01,162
You wanna hear some more?

486
00:44:02,902 --> 00:44:06,572
Helen Downing is having an affair.

487
00:44:09,112 --> 00:44:10,272
She what?

488
00:44:10,352 --> 00:44:14,112
She's doing the bad thing
with Vince Barnes...

489
00:44:14,182 --> 00:44:17,052
that two-bit country-club Romeo.

490
00:44:18,192 --> 00:44:21,282
Our little Helen
is not only a kidnapper...

491
00:44:21,362 --> 00:44:22,852
she's a slut.

492
00:44:25,662 --> 00:44:28,252
I thought you'd find that funny.

493
00:44:29,732 --> 00:44:32,222
Oh, God, from now on,
I'm keeping a close eye...

494
00:44:32,302 --> 00:44:35,532
on our Mrs. Downing
and that strapping stud of hers.

495
00:44:35,602 --> 00:44:37,872
You really are incredible.

496
00:44:37,942 --> 00:44:41,032
I mean, just the way
that you handle yourself.

497
00:44:42,942 --> 00:44:47,442
God forbid anything dangerous
should happen.

498
00:44:47,522 --> 00:44:49,112
Dangerous?

499
00:44:50,852 --> 00:44:54,622
I've got a black belt in aikido
and the boots to match.

500
00:45:11,412 --> 00:45:13,102
Touchdown !

501
00:45:19,012 --> 00:45:21,112
We'll be taking
the canyon drive today?

502
00:45:21,182 --> 00:45:24,412
Yes, I can't stand
this waiting around, Henry...

503
00:45:24,492 --> 00:45:26,422
sitting in the house.

504
00:45:26,492 --> 00:45:28,752
I thought, perhaps,
a drive alone might help.

505
00:45:36,102 --> 00:45:38,862
Let's go. It would be better
if I'm not here.

506
00:45:43,842 --> 00:45:45,272
Nice car.

507
00:45:46,712 --> 00:45:49,612
I don't believe it.

508
00:45:49,682 --> 00:45:54,482
A 1936 supercharged
auburn 851 speedster...

509
00:45:54,552 --> 00:45:57,382
with double overhead cams
and in cherry condition.

510
00:45:57,452 --> 00:46:00,622
You're certainly
a font of knowledge.

511
00:46:00,692 --> 00:46:03,382
I'm fond of many things.

512
00:46:03,462 --> 00:46:06,892
One of them is keeping an eye
on my quarry.

513
00:46:10,402 --> 00:46:14,842
I can just see him now,
hanging onto that wheel...

514
00:46:14,902 --> 00:46:18,462
Listening to Mozart,
heading down that canyon.

515
00:46:18,542 --> 00:46:20,702
He's gonna die a happy man.

516
00:46:30,822 --> 00:46:35,022
The whole trick to tailing
a suspect is anticipation.

517
00:46:35,092 --> 00:46:39,652
Anticipation, perseverance
and inconspicuousness.

518
00:46:39,732 --> 00:46:41,852
Do you make this stuff up
as you go along?

519
00:46:41,932 --> 00:46:46,332
No. I've been so thoroughly trained,
I don't have to think before speaking.

520
00:46:47,242 --> 00:46:50,862
So, tell me, what's it like
being a great detective and all?

521
00:46:52,172 --> 00:46:54,842
Well, my modesty
prohibits me saying.

522
00:46:54,912 --> 00:46:58,972
However, I can tell you what it's like
coming from a long line of detectives.

523
00:46:59,052 --> 00:47:04,212
It was a very, very
big pain in the butt.

524
00:47:04,292 --> 00:47:08,882
- Oh, same old family crap, huh?
- Yeah. You know, Nikki...

525
00:47:08,962 --> 00:47:12,412
I'm not like those other Crumbs.

526
00:47:12,492 --> 00:47:15,222
I'm my own Crumb.
You know what I mean?

527
00:47:15,302 --> 00:47:17,732
But it's different with Jennifer.

528
00:47:17,802 --> 00:47:22,462
I mean, she's so good at everything,
and she's so beautiful.

529
00:47:22,542 --> 00:47:24,532
Not that I'm jealous or anything.

530
00:47:24,612 --> 00:47:27,072
Perhaps Jennifer
should be the jealous one.

531
00:47:32,552 --> 00:47:34,612
I have this feeling.

532
00:47:34,682 --> 00:47:37,552
- That he's dead?
- Do you think so?

533
00:47:38,722 --> 00:47:40,452
To tell you the truth...

534
00:47:40,522 --> 00:47:42,492
there's a way in which you and I
are very much alike.

535
00:47:43,292 --> 00:47:45,952
We're both traveling
through life...

536
00:47:46,992 --> 00:47:49,162
in a car with no brakes.

537
00:48:13,552 --> 00:48:15,752
- My God!
- It's Crumb!

538
00:48:27,272 --> 00:48:31,262
- For Christ's sake, can't you lose him?
- He's on me like glue.

539
00:48:31,342 --> 00:48:33,712
Hey, what happened
to inconspicuous?

540
00:48:33,772 --> 00:48:36,172
Not now, my little health shake.

541
00:48:39,282 --> 00:48:41,812
He's good, really good.

542
00:48:47,192 --> 00:48:48,712
Can't you control this thing?

543
00:49:15,882 --> 00:49:18,612
Let's see. "Runaway vehicle--

544
00:49:18,692 --> 00:49:21,552
Step number one--
remain calm.

545
00:49:21,622 --> 00:49:24,062
Step number two--
feather the brakes...

546
00:49:24,132 --> 00:49:26,722
with a light pumping motion."

547
00:49:38,842 --> 00:49:42,742
- Holy shit, that was dangerous.
- Danger?

548
00:49:42,812 --> 00:49:45,242
Danger's my middle name.

549
00:49:49,382 --> 00:49:52,412
I'm sure of it, Nikki.
It was no accident.

550
00:49:52,492 --> 00:49:56,452
The brakes on your father's car
were deliberately tampered with.

551
00:49:56,522 --> 00:49:58,992
One thing that puzzles me is
how the kidnappers knew...

552
00:49:59,062 --> 00:50:01,492
I would be driving P.J.'s car.

553
00:50:02,862 --> 00:50:06,392
That Vince Barnes--
He's craftier than I thought.

554
00:50:06,472 --> 00:50:08,962
Come on, he's an idiot.

555
00:50:09,042 --> 00:50:12,872
A book cover
is only skin-deep.

556
00:50:12,942 --> 00:50:16,932
Sometimes you have to read every word
to get the whole picture.

557
00:50:17,012 --> 00:50:20,472
I think it's time we paid
Mr. Vince Barnes a little visit.

558
00:50:20,552 --> 00:50:23,282
Mr. Crumb, I have news.

559
00:50:23,352 --> 00:50:25,982
My mechanic says the brake fluid
was deliberately drained.

560
00:50:26,052 --> 00:50:28,212
Harry already figured that out.

561
00:50:28,292 --> 00:50:31,122
In that case, the kidnappers have made
one fatal mistake.

562
00:50:31,192 --> 00:50:34,162
- What's that, Mr. Crumb?
- They're making me mad.

563
00:50:34,232 --> 00:50:38,562
Dad, we're gonna set up
a surveillance operation.

564
00:50:40,302 --> 00:50:43,762
I'm sure Mr. Crumb doesn't need you
interfering with his work.

565
00:50:43,842 --> 00:50:47,272
On the contrary, P.J.,
Nikki's been invaluable to me.

566
00:50:47,342 --> 00:50:49,672
I'm sure she means
to be helpful, but--

567
00:50:49,742 --> 00:50:51,912
No buts about it.

568
00:50:51,982 --> 00:50:54,612
Nikki has given me information
I couldn't have gotten on my own.

569
00:50:54,682 --> 00:50:56,342
You shouldn't underestimate her.

570
00:50:56,422 --> 00:51:01,122
Yes. Well, I'll take that
into consideration.

571
00:51:01,192 --> 00:51:05,182
You're an insightful man, Mr. Crumb.
A man of many talents.

572
00:51:05,262 --> 00:51:09,132
It's a burden, yes,
but one that I can live with.

573
00:51:28,782 --> 00:51:31,152
There we are.
There we are right here.

574
00:51:31,222 --> 00:51:34,782
Good, good, good.
Vince Barnes.

575
00:51:38,562 --> 00:51:39,992
Number nine.

576
00:51:40,062 --> 00:51:43,502
Good, good, good.
That's very good to know.

577
00:51:48,472 --> 00:51:51,132
Right, right!
Combination, combination!

578
00:51:51,212 --> 00:51:53,172
That's it!
Left, right!

579
00:51:53,242 --> 00:51:55,172
Come on, throw him!

580
00:52:01,582 --> 00:52:06,382
Oh, boy. A thousand apologies for
my face hitting your fisticuffs, sahib.

581
00:52:06,452 --> 00:52:10,192
- Who are you?
- I am Vijay from Bombay.

582
00:52:10,262 --> 00:52:13,422
Bombay Air-Conditioning.
Let me give you my card.

583
00:52:14,602 --> 00:52:18,092
When the going gets hot,
the hot get air-conditioning.

584
00:52:18,172 --> 00:52:19,602
It's a cute slogan, no?

585
00:52:19,672 --> 00:52:21,102
Beat it.

586
00:52:21,172 --> 00:52:23,762
Perhaps later, but now
I'll fix your air-conditioning.

587
00:52:23,842 --> 00:52:27,502
Now listen, Tonto. I don't know
if you speak American...

588
00:52:27,582 --> 00:52:29,542
but I'm just gonna say this once:

589
00:52:29,612 --> 00:52:33,012
Nobody told me nothing
about no air-conditioning repair.

590
00:52:33,082 --> 00:52:35,112
Okay, I don't know anything
about that.

591
00:52:35,182 --> 00:52:40,052
I do know this. The people
of this building are very hot now.

592
00:52:40,122 --> 00:52:42,252
They are sweaty and disgusting.

593
00:52:42,322 --> 00:52:44,222
They are all blaming you.

594
00:52:44,292 --> 00:52:46,022
- Me?
- Yes.

595
00:52:46,092 --> 00:52:50,052
I've even heard them say
they're talking about your dismissal.

596
00:52:51,132 --> 00:52:53,122
What are you standing around for?
Get!

597
00:52:53,202 --> 00:52:56,642
- Come on, get your butt up there.
- All right, I'm going.

598
00:53:01,112 --> 00:53:05,142
I still don't understand why Crumb was
in that car. P.J. should've been dead.

599
00:53:05,212 --> 00:53:09,152
Shut up. Just think of another way
to kill him and pour me a drink.

600
00:53:30,342 --> 00:53:33,432
I got it!
Vince's apartment is right here...

601
00:53:33,512 --> 00:53:36,502
and the ventilator shaft runs
right alongside of it.

602
00:53:36,582 --> 00:53:38,012
Right.

603
00:53:53,592 --> 00:53:56,462
- Hello?
- Hello, Mr. Barnes.

604
00:53:56,532 --> 00:53:57,962
- Yeah?
- You're late.

605
00:53:58,032 --> 00:53:59,472
- What?
- Tennis lesson.

606
00:53:59,532 --> 00:54:02,022
- You mean right now?
- That's right. I'm waiting.

607
00:54:02,102 --> 00:54:03,542
Okay.

608
00:54:04,442 --> 00:54:06,032
Who was that?

609
00:54:06,112 --> 00:54:09,012
- The club. I got a lesson.
- Now?

610
00:54:09,082 --> 00:54:11,602
Hey, babe, I'll be back
in an hour.

611
00:54:11,682 --> 00:54:14,202
Just like a doctor--
always on call.

612
00:54:14,282 --> 00:54:16,152
God help us.

613
00:54:24,292 --> 00:54:26,452
How you doing, Harry?

614
00:54:26,532 --> 00:54:28,622
The things I do for money.

615
00:54:28,702 --> 00:54:32,132
Okay, listen, you're almost there.
About another...

616
00:54:32,202 --> 00:54:35,502
15 feet up on your left--
not too far.

617
00:54:35,572 --> 00:54:37,502
That's easy for you to say.

618
00:54:41,382 --> 00:54:44,472
What's the matter, big boy?
Just couldn't stay away?

619
00:54:50,222 --> 00:54:53,022
What the hell are you doing here?

620
00:54:53,092 --> 00:54:55,522
I might ask you the same thing.

621
00:55:00,662 --> 00:55:01,922
Classy.

622
00:55:02,002 --> 00:55:04,022
You can't just barge in here.

623
00:55:04,102 --> 00:55:05,932
Better me than your husband.

624
00:55:11,312 --> 00:55:14,102
Number 9. I'm here.

625
00:55:14,172 --> 00:55:15,842
Oh, damn!

626
00:55:15,912 --> 00:55:18,902
The vent's too high.
I can barely see.

627
00:55:18,982 --> 00:55:23,752
This is very low,
blackmailing me for sexual favors.

628
00:55:23,822 --> 00:55:29,192
But what the hell.
Just give me a minute.

629
00:55:35,102 --> 00:55:36,692
...in our own hacienda.

630
00:55:36,762 --> 00:55:37,962
With servants?

631
00:55:38,032 --> 00:55:40,972
Servants and seascapes
and champagne wishes.

632
00:55:41,042 --> 00:55:43,132
And caviar dreams.

633
00:55:43,202 --> 00:55:47,402
With my brains and your brown eyes,
we're goin' places. Big places.

634
00:55:47,472 --> 00:55:49,412
We'll get the loot
and to straight to the airport.

635
00:55:49,482 --> 00:55:51,642
I got tickets booked
under a false name.

636
00:55:51,712 --> 00:55:55,812
- No, there's no coming back.
- They're giving away everything!

637
00:55:55,882 --> 00:55:59,082
It's like taking candy from a baby.

638
00:55:59,152 --> 00:56:02,492
- What about the girl?
- Forget her. We don't need her anymore.

639
00:56:02,562 --> 00:56:04,552
- Not where we're going.
- You mean--

640
00:56:04,632 --> 00:56:07,392
That's right, baby.
Buenos Aires.

641
00:56:09,562 --> 00:56:11,762
Buenos Aires, is it?

642
00:56:11,832 --> 00:56:13,822
- Great!
- Are you sure you can handle it?

643
00:56:13,902 --> 00:56:17,302
I can handle it.
I can handle anything.

644
00:56:25,512 --> 00:56:28,952
If I were rich, would you
think differently of me?

645
00:56:31,152 --> 00:56:34,612
What kind of girl
do you think I am?

646
00:56:34,692 --> 00:56:37,122
Of course I would.

647
00:56:37,192 --> 00:56:38,622
Good.

648
00:56:40,932 --> 00:56:45,762
Hold me. Touch me.
Kiss me, you mad fool.

649
00:56:45,832 --> 00:56:48,202
You make me feel
like a woman again.

650
00:56:49,542 --> 00:56:52,002
What is going on in there?

651
00:56:52,072 --> 00:56:54,602
Sounds like things
are getting a little mushy.

652
00:56:54,682 --> 00:56:56,042
Stop!

653
00:56:57,612 --> 00:57:00,102
- It's too hot.
- What?

654
00:57:00,182 --> 00:57:03,052
Turn on the air-conditioner.
It's too hot.

655
00:57:03,122 --> 00:57:05,142
I can't wait, my darling.

656
00:57:05,222 --> 00:57:08,922
I get the feeling there ain't nobody
in this crazy, mixed-up world...

657
00:57:08,992 --> 00:57:11,252
who can stop us now.

658
00:57:12,362 --> 00:57:13,852
It's just dribbling out.

659
00:57:15,062 --> 00:57:18,362
It's a little nippy in here.

660
00:57:18,432 --> 00:57:21,532
What kind of cheap place is this?

661
00:57:35,982 --> 00:57:39,512
It's probably just clogged.
Just put it on exhaust.

662
00:57:40,752 --> 00:57:42,192
What a piece of junk.

663
00:57:45,662 --> 00:57:47,752
What the heck?

664
00:58:02,612 --> 00:58:05,412
Stick him! Move!
That's it! Up! Down!

665
00:58:17,292 --> 00:58:19,922
All right!
My lucky day!

666
00:58:23,832 --> 00:58:26,392
Move! Sucker punch!

667
00:58:30,102 --> 00:58:31,572
More coins!

668
00:58:31,642 --> 00:58:33,232
All right, come on.

669
00:58:33,312 --> 00:58:35,142
Come to Daddy.

670
00:58:35,212 --> 00:58:37,912
Come on. Jackpot!

671
00:58:42,152 --> 00:58:46,052
And Kelly is the winner
at 1:29 in the 11th round.

672
00:59:36,602 --> 00:59:38,372
Shit!

673
00:59:38,442 --> 00:59:42,902
Vince, you are not listening.
They want the money on Friday.

674
00:59:42,982 --> 00:59:45,952
This Friday. I think
I can buy us a little time...

675
00:59:46,012 --> 00:59:48,072
but we just have to kill him
this weekend.

676
00:59:48,152 --> 00:59:49,642
No, you don't understand.

677
00:59:49,722 --> 00:59:52,482
If they don't get their money
on Friday, they might kill her.

678
00:59:52,552 --> 00:59:54,782
Don't be such a putz, Vince.

679
00:59:54,862 --> 00:59:57,152
You make an omelet,
you break a few eggs.

680
00:59:57,222 --> 01:00:02,292
Just be there tonight,
you big hunk of meat.

681
01:00:11,142 --> 01:00:15,802
Eliot, I have
something to show you.

682
01:00:15,882 --> 01:00:17,872
- You do?
- Yes.

683
01:00:17,952 --> 01:00:21,112
As a result of my clandestine
photo operation...

684
01:00:21,182 --> 01:00:25,142
I have photographic prints
showing Helen Downing...

685
01:00:25,222 --> 01:00:29,552
and Vince Barnes in the midst
of their humping activity.

686
01:00:30,722 --> 01:00:33,222
- And you want me to see them?
- Of course.

687
01:00:33,292 --> 01:00:36,392
I'm always interested
in your professional opinion.

688
01:00:36,462 --> 01:00:38,692
Say, is that a dog?

689
01:00:38,772 --> 01:00:41,462
Why don't we just discuss this
in your office?

690
01:00:41,542 --> 01:00:42,762
As you wish.

691
01:00:44,142 --> 01:00:47,272
Come on in, Eliot.
Make yourself to home.

692
01:00:48,582 --> 01:00:52,772
I took these yesterday.
I had the lab put a rush on them.

693
01:00:52,852 --> 01:00:55,212
Go ahead.
Have a look-see.

694
01:00:56,652 --> 01:01:00,922
You were photographing
Vince Barnes' apartment yesterday?

695
01:01:00,992 --> 01:01:02,422
Exactly.

696
01:01:21,212 --> 01:01:23,472
You haven't looked
at these, have you?

697
01:01:23,542 --> 01:01:25,912
No. I was there.

698
01:01:29,882 --> 01:01:34,822
You'd think an athletic guy like
Vince Barnes would have a big dingus.

699
01:01:34,892 --> 01:01:37,522
But no, take a look
at that pathetic little...

700
01:01:38,832 --> 01:01:41,022
fallacy.

701
01:01:43,632 --> 01:01:46,432
You don't know anything
about this kidnapping, do you?

702
01:01:46,502 --> 01:01:48,432
Quite the contrary.

703
01:01:48,502 --> 01:01:53,242
The kidnappers are so unnerved by me,
they've had to change their plans.

704
01:01:53,312 --> 01:01:54,742
What are you talking about?

705
01:01:57,712 --> 01:02:00,682
See for yourself. They
pushed back the ransom top...

706
01:02:00,752 --> 01:02:02,722
from Friday till Monday.

707
01:02:02,782 --> 01:02:05,722
- This is wrong.
- No, it's perfect.

708
01:02:05,792 --> 01:02:07,522
Perfect!

709
01:02:07,592 --> 01:02:09,992
I believe, Eliot--

710
01:02:10,062 --> 01:02:13,422
in fact, I know--
that at this very moment...

711
01:02:13,492 --> 01:02:17,762
the kidnappers are in pain,
mental torment...

712
01:02:17,832 --> 01:02:20,822
trying to figure out
my next move.

713
01:02:20,902 --> 01:02:23,032
There's only one thing
I don't know--

714
01:02:24,272 --> 01:02:26,502
what this lever does.

715
01:02:26,572 --> 01:02:29,702
I don't know.
Maybe it's a brake.

716
01:02:29,782 --> 01:02:33,872
Come on, Eliot. What kind of
stationary bike has a brake?

717
01:03:01,242 --> 01:03:04,572
You know, Eliot, you were right.
That was a brake.

718
01:03:06,152 --> 01:03:08,082
Go figure, huh?

719
01:03:25,132 --> 01:03:26,432
All there.

720
01:03:33,142 --> 01:03:35,072
All there.

721
01:03:44,992 --> 01:03:47,682
- One short.
- Oh, please!

722
01:03:47,752 --> 01:03:51,522
I hope you're not actually paying
this clown for his so-called services.

723
01:03:51,592 --> 01:03:54,752
"So-called"?
See for yourself, butch.

724
01:03:57,532 --> 01:04:01,062
95, 96, 97, 98...

725
01:04:05,042 --> 01:04:06,972
- 99.
- Amazing.

726
01:04:13,712 --> 01:04:15,312
All right.

727
01:04:25,492 --> 01:04:28,022
Right on time. Eliot!

728
01:04:35,342 --> 01:04:39,432
This is Jennifer.
They want the money today.

729
01:04:39,512 --> 01:04:41,172
Today instead of Monday?

730
01:04:41,242 --> 01:04:43,972
That's right.
Put the money in a suitcase...

731
01:04:44,042 --> 01:04:47,242
and go to the racetrack at noon...

732
01:04:47,312 --> 01:04:49,912
then wait by the phone
next to the jockeys' entrance.

733
01:04:49,982 --> 01:04:51,612
And no police...

734
01:04:51,692 --> 01:04:53,552
or they'll kill me.

735
01:04:53,622 --> 01:04:56,952
Okay, Jennifer. Just relax.
Everything's going to be fine--

736
01:05:05,772 --> 01:05:07,202
Too short to get a trace.

737
01:05:07,272 --> 01:05:08,462
Exactly.

738
01:05:12,112 --> 01:05:15,102
Very nice.

739
01:05:15,182 --> 01:05:19,742
I'd say you got at least
a 50-50 chance of livin'.

740
01:05:22,122 --> 01:05:23,342
And good news--

741
01:05:23,422 --> 01:05:26,012
We're going to the airport.

742
01:05:28,192 --> 01:05:30,712
As long as we
keep track of the money...

743
01:05:30,792 --> 01:05:32,952
we know where the kidnappers are.

744
01:05:36,532 --> 01:05:39,832
This gives us a range
of up to three miles.

745
01:05:39,902 --> 01:05:43,732
There is no way they'll be aware
of police presence.

746
01:05:44,912 --> 01:05:46,842
Sounds peachy.

747
01:05:53,212 --> 01:05:54,912
Sounds okay to me.

748
01:05:54,982 --> 01:05:57,752
As long as the police
stay completely out of sight...

749
01:05:57,822 --> 01:05:59,252
and out of my way.

750
01:06:03,892 --> 01:06:06,762
When this is all over, Crumb...

751
01:06:06,832 --> 01:06:09,692
I'm gonna rip your heart out
and eat it for breakfast.

752
01:06:11,032 --> 01:06:13,022
Take a number.

753
01:06:16,372 --> 01:06:18,842
Vince, we've got a problem.

754
01:06:51,742 --> 01:06:55,612
Hello, Susie? My name is Angel.

755
01:06:55,682 --> 01:06:58,242
I'm a friend of Miguel.

756
01:07:14,292 --> 01:07:16,422
- Give the money to Draisen.
- Pardon?

757
01:07:18,532 --> 01:07:22,992
Give the money to Eliot Draisen.

758
01:07:23,072 --> 01:07:25,542
- Who?
- Eliot Draisen.

759
01:07:25,612 --> 01:07:27,132
- Eliot Draisen?
- Give him the money.

760
01:07:27,212 --> 01:07:30,142
You want me to give the money
to Eliot Draisem?

761
01:07:31,982 --> 01:07:34,312
Hello? Kidnapper?

762
01:07:34,952 --> 01:07:38,252
I can barely here you.
Hello, man !

763
01:07:38,322 --> 01:07:40,252
Speak up, for God's sake!

764
01:07:40,322 --> 01:07:42,652
Use your voice.

765
01:07:42,722 --> 01:07:46,092
We have a faulty connection.
I'm on a jockey phone.

766
01:07:47,162 --> 01:07:49,092
I'm on the phone.

767
01:07:50,562 --> 01:07:52,552
I'm on the phone
with the kidnappers.

768
01:07:52,632 --> 01:07:55,292
I guess I'm supposed
to take it from here.

769
01:07:55,372 --> 01:07:58,432
So, just help me, okay?

770
01:07:58,512 --> 01:08:00,972
That's my pants.
All right.

771
01:08:01,042 --> 01:08:03,482
Hold there.
Wait a minute.

772
01:08:04,882 --> 01:08:07,112
Breathe in.

773
01:08:16,662 --> 01:08:18,092
Good-bye, Harry Crumb.

774
01:08:22,232 --> 01:08:25,062
- What now?
- Who said that?

775
01:08:25,132 --> 01:08:27,662
It's Nikki. I thought
you might need me.

776
01:08:29,472 --> 01:08:32,342
- What do we do now?
- Now we sit tight.

777
01:08:32,412 --> 01:08:36,002
There's no point in following them,
'cause we know where they're going.

778
01:08:36,082 --> 01:08:39,072
The flight to Buenos Aires
doesn't leave till 4:00.

779
01:08:39,152 --> 01:08:42,112
We've got all the time
in the world.

780
01:08:43,552 --> 01:08:46,422
And I think we're gonna need it.
I think I'm stuck.

781
01:08:47,592 --> 01:08:49,522
I know I'm stuck.

782
01:09:00,372 --> 01:09:02,102
Let's go.

783
01:09:28,762 --> 01:09:31,532
Shit!
What the hell was that?

784
01:09:45,012 --> 01:09:48,142
- You're losing him.
- He's right there. Let me handle it.

785
01:09:48,212 --> 01:09:50,812
We just have to get the money
before the kidnappers do.

786
01:09:50,882 --> 01:09:52,982
Vin, just get it!

787
01:10:10,502 --> 01:10:12,442
What do you think he's doing?

788
01:10:12,512 --> 01:10:15,632
Do I look like
Mr. Friggin' Wizard?

789
01:10:15,712 --> 01:10:19,012
He's doing whatever the hell
the kidnappers told him to do.

790
01:10:59,092 --> 01:11:01,382
You idiot!

791
01:11:06,832 --> 01:11:10,562
One, two, three!

792
01:11:34,922 --> 01:11:38,152
Now announcing the arrival
of flight 50 from New York...

793
01:11:38,222 --> 01:11:40,222
arriving at gate 88.

794
01:11:47,932 --> 01:11:50,202
I hate being poor.

795
01:11:50,272 --> 01:11:52,432
We've still got each other, babe.

796
01:11:52,512 --> 01:11:55,242
They say our love
won't pay the rent

797
01:11:55,312 --> 01:11:58,682
Before it's earned
our money's all been spent

798
01:11:58,752 --> 01:12:00,802
I got you, babe

799
01:12:06,422 --> 01:12:08,892
- Yeah?
- Hello. Helen?

800
01:12:08,962 --> 01:12:13,552
Who is this? What the hell
do you want, Eliot?

801
01:12:17,162 --> 01:12:19,192
You what?

802
01:12:21,472 --> 01:12:23,662
You kidnapped her?

803
01:12:27,812 --> 01:12:29,542
Buenos Aires?

804
01:12:31,842 --> 01:12:35,372
Well, of course I'm coming.
I'm out the door, you cute little man.

805
01:12:40,592 --> 01:12:43,712
This jacket's too tight.
Those motel dry cleaners shrunk it.

806
01:12:43,792 --> 01:12:46,092
Yeah, right. Says you.

807
01:13:07,212 --> 01:13:10,152
Is that the money?

808
01:13:11,322 --> 01:13:13,252
Ten million?

809
01:13:14,892 --> 01:13:19,792
You know, Eliot, I have a little
confession of my own to make.

810
01:13:19,862 --> 01:13:21,292
What?

811
01:13:23,462 --> 01:13:26,462
I'm the one who changed
the ransom note.

812
01:13:26,532 --> 01:13:28,662
You?

813
01:13:28,742 --> 01:13:32,972
Well, I've been trying to kill P.J.
You know, for his money.

814
01:13:38,852 --> 01:13:43,152
I guess we're just
two of a kind.

815
01:13:44,322 --> 01:13:46,252
We're made for each other.

816
01:13:58,972 --> 01:14:01,992
You shouldn't talk so loud
on the phone, Helen.

817
01:14:04,242 --> 01:14:06,902
Give me the suitcase, pal.
Nice and slow.

818
01:14:18,052 --> 01:14:21,712
Thank God you're here!
I've been so worried.

819
01:14:22,792 --> 01:14:25,922
Can you believe this man
almost got away with our money?

820
01:14:28,232 --> 01:14:32,692
I don't know, Helen.
I don't think I can trust you anymore.

821
01:14:54,792 --> 01:14:56,252
In there.

822
01:15:04,632 --> 01:15:07,902
I don't think
you'll be needing those.

823
01:15:12,142 --> 01:15:13,732
Hit it.

824
01:15:20,182 --> 01:15:22,152
The bag!

825
01:15:27,822 --> 01:15:30,912
- Flight 212 to Buenos Aires, gate 17.
- Right.

826
01:15:40,532 --> 01:15:44,232
Flight 212 to Buenos Aires
now boarding.

827
01:15:50,242 --> 01:15:52,682
Should be gettin' a call
any minute now.

828
01:15:59,822 --> 01:16:01,752
Are you gonna miss me?

829
01:16:42,932 --> 01:16:45,022
Metal plate in my head.

830
01:16:45,102 --> 01:16:48,462
I forgot. Scooter accident
when I was a kid.

831
01:16:49,742 --> 01:16:51,862
Metal plate.

832
01:16:51,942 --> 01:16:54,572
It doesn't hurt.

833
01:16:54,642 --> 01:16:56,342
All right.

834
01:17:18,562 --> 01:17:20,032
Come on !

835
01:17:36,422 --> 01:17:38,612
Take it down, Nikki!

836
01:17:39,752 --> 01:17:42,152
I can't get this thing down !

837
01:17:49,532 --> 01:17:51,292
Nikki, turn !

838
01:18:06,052 --> 01:18:07,712
Crumb, are you okay?

839
01:18:07,782 --> 01:18:09,482
Of course I'm okay!

840
01:18:31,802 --> 01:18:34,502
Ladies and gentlemen, we're currently
number three for takeoff.

841
01:18:34,572 --> 01:18:37,242
We'll be receiving
our takeoff clearance momentarily.

842
01:18:37,312 --> 01:18:39,332
You there! Pilot!

843
01:18:39,412 --> 01:18:41,142
Stop!

844
01:18:41,212 --> 01:18:44,242
We'll be cruising at 32,000 feet.

845
01:18:44,322 --> 01:18:46,582
What the fuck is that?

846
01:18:49,592 --> 01:18:51,492
Nikki, turn !

847
01:19:15,412 --> 01:19:16,712
Who is that?

848
01:19:16,782 --> 01:19:19,982
Crumb. Harry Crumb.

849
01:19:21,692 --> 01:19:24,452
And I hereby charge
these two miscreants...

850
01:19:24,522 --> 01:19:27,392
with the kidnapping
of one Jennifer Downing.

851
01:19:28,792 --> 01:19:32,202
- You must be crazy, Crumb.
- Crazy?

852
01:19:32,262 --> 01:19:34,292
Crazy like a fox.

853
01:19:35,702 --> 01:19:40,072
I must warn you, Vince Barnes,
I have a black belt in aikido.

854
01:19:53,492 --> 01:19:54,952
Just shoot him!

855
01:20:03,532 --> 01:20:05,462
And the boots to match.

856
01:20:24,922 --> 01:20:28,222
Thank you, Mr. Crumb.
Nikki says we owe everything to you.

857
01:20:28,292 --> 01:20:31,092
Oh, please.
I had a good partner.

858
01:20:32,192 --> 01:20:34,132
Didn't I tell you
he was a schmooze?

859
01:20:34,192 --> 01:20:37,922
If it's all right, Miss Downing, we'd
like to ask you a few more questions.

860
01:20:38,002 --> 01:20:39,932
Sure. Whatever.

861
01:20:45,602 --> 01:20:49,472
Well, well, well. Detective Casey.
What about your theory now?

862
01:20:50,742 --> 01:20:52,372
What can I say?

863
01:20:52,442 --> 01:20:56,442
What can you say? I'll tell you.
You can say that you're--

864
01:20:57,522 --> 01:21:01,112
It's just a thought,
that's all, a theory.

865
01:21:06,732 --> 01:21:08,662
Don't make a sound.

866
01:21:49,102 --> 01:21:52,942
Don't think I didn't know
what was goin' on in your mind.

867
01:21:55,242 --> 01:21:58,902
You didn't think I could
figure it out, did you?

868
01:21:58,982 --> 01:22:01,882
You didn't think
I was up to the challenge.

869
01:22:04,552 --> 01:22:07,492
Now you understand.

870
01:22:07,552 --> 01:22:11,322
Now you know how good I really am.

871
01:22:11,392 --> 01:22:15,092
Yeah, now you know
the folly of your ways.

872
01:22:16,602 --> 01:22:21,062
Maybe now, in front
of these two gentlemen...

873
01:22:21,132 --> 01:22:24,632
you'll finally be man enough
to give credit...

874
01:22:24,702 --> 01:22:27,002
where credit is due.

875
01:22:28,142 --> 01:22:30,732
What do you say to that,
Eliot Draisen?

876
01:22:32,752 --> 01:22:36,882
All right, you imbecile,
I confess! I did it!

877
01:22:36,952 --> 01:22:40,112
I kidnapped her!
I was behind the whole thing!

878
01:22:40,192 --> 01:22:45,422
I don't know how you figured it out
with that witless brain of yours...

879
01:22:45,492 --> 01:22:49,452
but I would rather rot in jail
for the rest of my life...

880
01:22:49,532 --> 01:22:54,332
rather than listen
to one more idiotic word!

881
01:22:59,372 --> 01:23:02,202
Book him.

882
01:23:02,272 --> 01:23:05,902
I'm forever in your debt, Harry.
I don't know how I can repay you.

883
01:23:05,982 --> 01:23:11,112
You kind words are enough, P.J.,
not to mention this enormous check.

884
01:23:11,182 --> 01:23:15,352
You've earned it, Harry.
You've given me back both my daughters.

885
01:23:17,362 --> 01:23:20,522
Harry, are you sure you won't
come with us to Hawaii?

886
01:23:20,592 --> 01:23:22,532
You'd look great in a grass skirt.

887
01:23:22,592 --> 01:23:27,532
Thanks, Nikki, but a president
must be on call 24 hours a day.

888
01:23:30,002 --> 01:23:32,272
- Good-bye, Crumb.
- Good-bye, Nikki.

889
01:23:37,512 --> 01:23:39,642
Remember, lunch,
soon as I get back.

890
01:23:39,712 --> 01:23:41,772
You got it.
Have a safe trip.

891
01:23:41,852 --> 01:23:44,442
Aloha. Say hi
to Don Ho for me.

892
01:23:44,522 --> 01:23:48,322
Excuse me, Mr. Crumb. These escrow
papers are waiting for your signature.

893
01:23:48,392 --> 01:23:51,222
Not quite. Tell the bank
we want to refinance at 8%.

894
01:23:51,292 --> 01:23:53,662
I need to set a date
for the stockholders meeting.

895
01:23:53,732 --> 01:23:56,222
Set it for the 12th. That'll give us
a week for that tax deferral.

896
01:23:56,302 --> 01:23:59,322
These are you drapes
for the board room, Mr. Crumb.

897
01:23:59,402 --> 01:24:02,832
- No. Go with Venetian blinds.
- Like I suggested in the first place.

898
01:24:02,902 --> 01:24:04,662
Not now. That's enough.

899
01:24:04,742 --> 01:24:06,672
Thank you.

900
01:24:08,212 --> 01:24:13,082
- San Francisco's calling on line two!
- All right.

901
01:24:17,482 --> 01:24:19,712
- Harry Crumb?
- Yes, this is Crumb.

902
01:24:19,792 --> 01:24:24,092
- You ever been to San Francisco?
- Yes, I've been to San Francisco.

903
01:24:24,162 --> 01:24:26,852
- The Bottoms Up Club?
- The Bottoms Up Club?

904
01:24:26,932 --> 01:24:29,492
- Yes, I've heard of that club. It's--
- Oh, you've been here?

905
01:24:29,562 --> 01:24:32,692
- No, I've never been there.
- There's been a murder.

906
01:24:32,772 --> 01:24:34,862
- A murder?
- Yes. Can you come?

907
01:24:34,932 --> 01:24:36,922
- Yes.
- Right away?

908
01:24:37,002 --> 01:24:39,942
- Consider me there.
- Good.

909
01:24:51,782 --> 01:24:52,982
Good luck, Harry.

910
01:24:55,422 --> 01:24:57,452
Yeah, I'm gonna need it.

911
01:25:12,522 --> 01:26:02,492
