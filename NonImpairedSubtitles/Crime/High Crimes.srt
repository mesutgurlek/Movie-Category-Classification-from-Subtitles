1
00:02:10,714 --> 00:02:12,508
If you get a chance,
get over to the marine,

2
00:02:12,508 --> 00:02:15,219
check out the marine's county
arts fair. It's amazing.

3
00:02:15,219 --> 00:02:18,347
It will be going on through this
thanksgiving weekend.

4
00:02:18,347 --> 00:02:20,015
Well, nothing change.

5
00:02:20,015 --> 00:02:23,685
We got fog and low cloud in
both east bay and here in

6
00:02:23,685 --> 00:02:25,020
San Francisco.

7
00:02:25,896 --> 00:02:28,982
And we looking at a high of 68
degree.

8
00:02:28,982 --> 00:02:33,153
Time now is twenty three after
seven.

9
00:02:34,821 --> 00:02:35,781
Oh my god.

10
00:03:07,437 --> 00:03:09,606
Honey, turn it off.

11
00:03:10,941 --> 00:03:12,985
We gotta make a baby.

12
00:03:21,076 --> 00:03:22,619
I can't do that now.

13
00:03:24,246 --> 00:03:26,874
We have an issue that need to
be resolved.

14
00:03:28,083 --> 00:03:29,585
It's red.

15
00:03:29,585 --> 00:03:31,295
Good, I'll talk to you later.

16
00:03:32,462 --> 00:03:33,755
I thought you had a sentencing.

17
00:03:33,755 --> 00:03:36,341
I do. So we got to hurry.
We have got 7 minutes.

18
00:03:37,926 --> 00:03:41,054
I'll be only 4 minutes late if
I check my messages in the car.

19
00:03:42,806 --> 00:03:44,808
How about 10 minutes for us and
12 minutes for your

20
00:03:44,808 --> 00:03:45,767
transportation?

21
00:03:45,767 --> 00:03:47,311
Mind in thirteen.

22
00:03:51,607 --> 00:03:54,234
No, suppose to be you're on
top.

23
00:03:56,570 --> 00:03:58,739
How come I never hear you say
that?

24
00:03:58,906 --> 00:04:00,032
So nice.

25
00:04:16,131 --> 00:04:17,716
But I think I can get a new
trial.

26
00:04:17,716 --> 00:04:20,427
Claire, I don't know we should
bite off that much.

27
00:04:20,427 --> 00:04:22,429
It's her first defense.
We could ask for Lenience.

28
00:04:22,429 --> 00:04:23,931
The juries' forewoman is an
advocate.

29
00:04:23,931 --> 00:04:25,724
She is not an impartial jury.

30
00:04:26,225 --> 00:04:28,477
I don't know. hate to push.
This is a rape case.

31
00:04:28,477 --> 00:04:30,270
I don't want top piss the judge
off.

32
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:31,772
Trust me on this, Alex.

33
00:04:33,524 --> 00:04:34,900
You telling me this is joking?

34
00:04:35,067 --> 00:04:37,277
Your honour, my client is
looking at some serious time in

35
00:04:37,277 --> 00:04:37,903
jail.

36
00:04:37,903 --> 00:04:40,822
While this guy are laughing
all the way to CNN.

37
00:04:40,822 --> 00:04:42,032
That ridiculous.

38
00:04:42,032 --> 00:04:44,618
Your honour,
jury number 9 is a rape victim.

39
00:04:44,618 --> 00:04:48,539
She's a major fund raiser for
sexual assault hotline.

40
00:04:48,539 --> 00:04:51,333
I must point out now however,
the prosecution should have

41
00:04:51,333 --> 00:04:52,459
submitted those fact.

42
00:04:52,459 --> 00:04:55,963
And the prosecutor's misconduct
does not stop there.

43
00:04:55,963 --> 00:04:57,756
Really, how do you figure that?

44
00:04:57,756 --> 00:05:01,134
The very D.A. office handle her
case 8 years ago.

45
00:05:01,134 --> 00:05:03,679
And I find it impossible to
believe that no one in the team

46
00:05:03,679 --> 00:05:05,097
recognize her.

47
00:05:05,138 --> 00:05:06,223
This is outrageous.

48
00:05:10,394 --> 00:05:12,688
I'm very pleased that she
gonna receive a new trial.

49
00:05:12,688 --> 00:05:15,148
His victim said she've been
rape all over again.

50
00:05:15,148 --> 00:05:16,149
This time by the system.

51
00:05:16,149 --> 00:05:17,317
My heart goes out to her.

52
00:05:17,317 --> 00:05:21,029
But anyone is violating the
regulations, justice will

53
00:05:21,029 --> 00:05:22,573
redress.

54
00:05:23,782 --> 00:05:24,533
Good job.

55
00:05:27,077 --> 00:05:28,954
Good job,
I need to talk to you.

56
00:05:28,996 --> 00:05:30,372
Good, I need gossip.

57
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:34,626
That was luck.

58
00:05:34,626 --> 00:05:36,920
Just like your Bruins last
night. Sorry about that.

59
00:05:38,297 --> 00:05:39,715
She scores again.

60
00:05:39,715 --> 00:05:41,508
Well the heart of America's
democracy beats on.

61
00:05:42,342 --> 00:05:43,552
Would you punch up my calendar,
please?

62
00:05:43,552 --> 00:05:44,720
Pleasure or business?

63
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:45,888
Both. Thanks.

64
00:05:47,014 --> 00:05:48,182
Oh, hi, big guy.

65
00:05:48,182 --> 00:05:49,099
Good work Claire.

66
00:05:49,099 --> 00:05:50,392
We proud of you.

67
00:05:50,392 --> 00:05:52,060
Thank you very much.

68
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:55,105
I guess we're like partner
right here from January first.

69
00:05:56,190 --> 00:05:58,609
I didn't know you were
clairvoyance.

70
00:05:59,484 --> 00:06:00,611
Really?

71
00:06:01,445 --> 00:06:02,779
Are you serious?

72
00:06:02,946 --> 00:06:03,739
We'll see.

73
00:06:08,577 --> 00:06:09,119
Not bad.

74
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:12,539
I think that was just lucky.

75
00:06:13,832 --> 00:06:14,833
Bring it up, girl.

76
00:06:15,584 --> 00:06:16,126
Pretty.

77
00:06:16,627 --> 00:06:18,045
Pretty nice.
-Pretty lucky.

78
00:06:18,587 --> 00:06:21,215
Well?

79
00:06:22,090 --> 00:06:23,383
I don't think you have a shot.

80
00:06:24,426 --> 00:06:26,136
Fifteen ball in that pocket.

81
00:06:26,595 --> 00:06:27,721
Not this life time, pal.

82
00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:28,931
Yes.

83
00:06:34,436 --> 00:06:37,022
That is not fair.

84
00:06:37,606 --> 00:06:39,566
You can't use your left hand.

85
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:42,903
You're a mutant.

86
00:06:45,113 --> 00:06:46,281
Hey, guys, look.

87
00:06:56,375 --> 00:06:57,167
You were great.

88
00:06:59,211 --> 00:06:59,753
Look at you.

89
00:08:17,998 --> 00:08:18,582
Honey.

90
00:08:19,208 --> 00:08:20,042
Lock the door.

91
00:08:21,043 --> 00:08:21,835
Someone is in the house.

92
00:09:01,208 --> 00:09:02,543
Hurry.

93
00:09:08,841 --> 00:09:09,299
damn kids.

94
00:09:11,218 --> 00:09:12,553
It's okay, honey.

95
00:09:13,178 --> 00:09:15,097
Send somebody right away.

96
00:09:15,514 --> 00:09:16,598
Are you okay?

97
00:09:22,938 --> 00:09:23,772
Oh, god.

98
00:09:27,568 --> 00:09:28,402
I'm fine.

99
00:09:48,881 --> 00:09:50,257
Baby alert.

100
00:09:51,884 --> 00:09:52,885
Could we meet your baby?

101
00:09:54,887 --> 00:09:57,097
Oh, my god, what a doll.

102
00:10:22,623 --> 00:10:24,750
You want a T-shirt or
something?

103
00:10:26,335 --> 00:10:29,379
All men all across America buy T-shirt.

104
00:10:34,009 --> 00:10:34,885
Nice.

105
00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:38,639
Yeah, that's the spirit.

106
00:10:39,306 --> 00:10:39,890
Interesting.

107
00:10:41,767 --> 00:10:42,976
Really interesting.

108
00:10:43,310 --> 00:10:44,728
Keys, please.

109
00:10:49,316 --> 00:10:50,275
What is it baby?

110
00:10:51,527 --> 00:10:52,444
FBI !

111
00:10:54,279 --> 00:10:55,739
Get down!

112
00:11:09,711 --> 00:11:10,671
Leave me alone!

113
00:11:18,428 --> 00:11:20,597
You know you're looking at
multimillion dollar lawsuit,

114
00:11:20,597 --> 00:11:22,099
right Mr. Mulkon?

115
00:11:24,518 --> 00:11:27,646
It is Mullins.
Special agent Mullins.

116
00:11:28,063 --> 00:11:30,107
You have a warrant for the
arrest of someone named

117
00:11:30,107 --> 00:11:31,275
Ron Chatman.

118
00:11:31,275 --> 00:11:32,734
My husband is Tom Kubik.

119
00:11:32,734 --> 00:11:35,028
Your computer obviously have
some kind of psychotic break.

120
00:11:35,028 --> 00:11:36,613
It wasn't our computer.

121
00:11:36,613 --> 00:11:39,366
If you people had got any
closer, you would have burn the

122
00:11:39,366 --> 00:11:40,784
guy. Alright?

123
00:11:41,076 --> 00:11:42,536
Fine. Forget about it.

124
00:11:43,912 --> 00:11:45,581
It wasn't our computer.

125
00:11:45,581 --> 00:11:46,790
It was marine P.D.

126
00:11:46,790 --> 00:11:49,293
They ran all the finger
prints after your house was

127
00:11:49,293 --> 00:11:50,210
burglarized.

128
00:11:50,210 --> 00:11:53,922
The FIS finds your husband.
He has been in the system for

129
00:11:53,922 --> 00:11:55,174
12 years

130
00:11:55,174 --> 00:11:56,967
What is he've been accused of?

131
00:11:56,967 --> 00:11:58,844
I'm sorry, but I can't tell you.

132
00:11:58,844 --> 00:12:01,221
You know they have been a
subject to arrest.

133
00:12:01,221 --> 00:12:03,098
I have the right to know the
charges.

134
00:12:03,098 --> 00:12:04,141
No, you don't.

135
00:12:04,141 --> 00:12:05,726
Not when it's military court.

136
00:12:05,726 --> 00:12:08,061
Not when national security is
involved.

137
00:12:08,061 --> 00:12:10,230
Military court?

138
00:12:55,234 --> 00:12:56,652
Thank god I call you.

139
00:12:59,738 --> 00:13:01,365
I caught you on the news.

140
00:13:01,573 --> 00:13:03,408
You have to stop letting them
messing with your hair.

141
00:13:04,576 --> 00:13:05,869
Jackie.
-I just need some money.

142
00:13:05,869 --> 00:13:06,870
I hate ask.

143
00:13:06,870 --> 00:13:08,497
But can you help me out,
please?

144
00:13:09,998 --> 00:13:12,417
My mum is with them right now
as we speak.

145
00:13:12,626 --> 00:13:14,336
If you say no,
I'm gonna be evicted.

146
00:13:14,962 --> 00:13:16,588
Can you come get me?

147
00:13:20,008 --> 00:13:21,426
I know what it could be.

148
00:13:21,677 --> 00:13:24,429
Maybe he did something that he
didn't even know he did.

149
00:13:24,596 --> 00:13:26,598
And, so? That's enough, Jackie.

150
00:13:26,598 --> 00:13:29,768
He is in witness protection?

151
00:13:30,936 --> 00:13:31,520
Sorry.

152
00:13:33,730 --> 00:13:35,440
Next time you need help call
your other sister.

153
00:13:36,358 --> 00:13:37,609
Oh, no, wait.

154
00:13:37,609 --> 00:13:38,735
You don't have another sister.

155
00:13:38,819 --> 00:13:40,612
I didn't call you Jackie,
you called me.

156
00:13:40,612 --> 00:13:42,197
Yeah, and I came here to pick
you up.

157
00:13:42,197 --> 00:13:45,742
Looked like the first you try
to see me in months. By the way.

158
00:13:53,166 --> 00:13:56,003
The base in San Lazaro is about
45 minutes south of L.A. off the

159
00:13:56,003 --> 00:13:56,753
coast.

160
00:13:57,004 --> 00:14:00,799
I booked you a flight into John
Wayne airport in Orange County.

161
00:14:00,883 --> 00:14:02,009
Okay with luggage?

162
00:14:02,009 --> 00:14:03,635
Luggage and the rental car
should be at the base at between

163
00:14:03,635 --> 00:14:04,636
eleven or eleven thirty.

164
00:14:30,746 --> 00:14:33,624
Good afternoon, madam,
may I see your Id please.

165
00:15:36,103 --> 00:15:37,271
Mrs. Kubik.

166
00:15:38,063 --> 00:15:39,231
James Hernandez.

167
00:15:40,899 --> 00:15:42,317
This must be a terrible shock
to you.

168
00:15:43,277 --> 00:15:44,903
Is there anything I can do?
-Anderson!

169
00:15:45,487 --> 00:15:48,031
Hutchinson! Chatman, Green.

170
00:15:49,491 --> 00:15:51,326
Ron was a good marine.

171
00:15:51,326 --> 00:15:52,452
I won't keep you. Good luck.

172
00:15:52,452 --> 00:15:53,912
Thank you.

173
00:15:54,121 --> 00:15:55,914
End of the hall, madam.

174
00:15:57,749 --> 00:15:58,584
Room B, madam.

175
00:16:28,113 --> 00:16:30,365
Where the hell are his clothes?

176
00:16:30,365 --> 00:16:31,658
Suicide watch, madam.

177
00:16:31,658 --> 00:16:33,243
I want clothes put on him right
now.

178
00:16:33,243 --> 00:16:35,037
You'll have to file a request
on your way out.

179
00:16:57,226 --> 00:16:59,561
Is your name Ron Chatman?

180
00:17:12,324 --> 00:17:13,450
Yes.

181
00:17:35,222 --> 00:17:37,808
I don't know what to say.

182
00:17:39,351 --> 00:17:41,186
I had no choice.

183
00:17:41,979 --> 00:17:45,440
I had no choice.

184
00:17:46,733 --> 00:17:49,319
They were accusing me on
something that I didn't do.

185
00:17:50,445 --> 00:17:51,697
Please believe me.

186
00:17:52,364 --> 00:17:53,198
Believe you.

187
00:17:58,954 --> 00:18:05,085
I believe that?

188
00:18:05,419 --> 00:18:10,090
never married?

189
00:18:11,008 --> 00:18:12,134
you love me.

190
00:18:12,843 --> 00:18:13,385
Ron.

191
00:18:14,303 --> 00:18:15,179
Tom.

192
00:18:15,804 --> 00:18:16,972
What ever you name is.

193
00:18:23,687 --> 00:18:24,980
I do love you.

194
00:18:25,898 --> 00:18:27,608
But I did not do this.

195
00:18:29,401 --> 00:18:29,943
Okay?

196
00:18:35,115 --> 00:18:38,410
I swear that I never did this.

197
00:18:40,204 --> 00:18:41,914
I didn't want to tell you.

198
00:18:42,539 --> 00:18:44,541
Is that I don't want you to leave me.

199
00:18:55,677 --> 00:18:56,261
What happened?

200
00:18:58,931 --> 00:18:59,640
My lawyer is here.

201
00:19:05,187 --> 00:19:06,396
Mrs. Kubik.

202
00:19:07,397 --> 00:19:08,565
Sorry to interrupt.

203
00:19:08,815 --> 00:19:10,609
I'm First Lieutenant Embry,
Terance.

204
00:19:15,989 --> 00:19:17,199
I'm older than I look.

205
00:19:21,453 --> 00:19:24,248
Well, I'll et you two...

206
00:19:25,541 --> 00:19:26,083
I'll wait.

207
00:19:34,842 --> 00:19:35,926
Claire.

208
00:19:37,803 --> 00:19:38,887
I'll go talk to him, okay?

209
00:19:50,065 --> 00:19:51,358
First Lieutenant.

210
00:19:51,358 --> 00:19:53,110
Is that what I call you?
-Lieutenant.

211
00:19:53,110 --> 00:19:56,280
Why you didn't request to get
him out of the chain and put in

212
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:57,197
some clothes?

213
00:19:57,990 --> 00:19:59,324
Alright, I'll take care of it.

214
00:19:59,366 --> 00:20:02,411
I'm an attorney.
May I see the charging document?

215
00:20:03,370 --> 00:20:04,705
We call it charge sheet.

216
00:20:04,997 --> 00:20:06,290
Fabulous, may I see it?

217
00:20:09,084 --> 00:20:10,252
Can you give me the basic?

218
00:20:10,836 --> 00:20:12,504
Article 85, desertion.

219
00:20:12,754 --> 00:20:16,341
Article 90, assaulting or
willfully disobeying a superior's

220
00:20:16,341 --> 00:20:17,759
commission? -Murder?

221
00:20:18,010 --> 00:20:18,927
9?

222
00:20:19,386 --> 00:20:21,763
Yes, if convicted he'll get the
death penalty.

223
00:20:29,188 --> 00:20:29,855
Who is prosecuting?

224
00:20:30,439 --> 00:20:31,523
Major Luke Waldron.

225
00:20:34,943 --> 00:20:35,861
Any good?

226
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:37,321
The best.

227
00:20:38,238 --> 00:20:39,740
How about you?

228
00:20:40,282 --> 00:20:41,200
I do okay.

229
00:20:41,992 --> 00:20:43,660
Have you ever won a case?

230
00:20:45,037 --> 00:20:45,746
No.

231
00:20:53,837 --> 00:20:55,172
I'm going to defend you.

232
00:20:55,589 --> 00:20:57,424
I know you didn't kill 9
people.

233
00:20:57,674 --> 00:20:59,968
I don't want you involve in
this.

234
00:21:00,385 --> 00:21:01,762
I'm already involved.

235
00:21:02,221 --> 00:21:05,140
You don't understand.
Military law is?

236
00:21:06,433 --> 00:21:08,060
We gonna fight them, okay?

237
00:21:08,185 --> 00:21:08,936
Together.

238
00:21:16,026 --> 00:21:18,195
Still remember those 3 American
kids?

239
00:21:19,363 --> 00:21:20,155
Students.

240
00:21:20,656 --> 00:21:24,368
Were killed in that cafe in
El Salvador back in 1 988.

241
00:21:25,744 --> 00:21:28,163
In a little town called
Montezo.

242
00:21:29,665 --> 00:21:33,377
I remember the rebel group
threw a bomb into the cafe.

243
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:38,173
The press had a field day.

244
00:21:38,173 --> 00:21:39,466
Everybody went nuts.

245
00:21:40,509 --> 00:21:43,136
So they call up my unit,
detachment 27,

246
00:21:43,470 --> 00:21:46,014
to locate the rebel leader who
is responsible.

247
00:21:46,223 --> 00:21:48,016
He is a terrorist by the name
dinelo Chicon.

248
00:21:48,642 --> 00:21:50,561
And your orders came from?

249
00:21:50,769 --> 00:21:53,480
RCO, Bill Marks. Anyway?

250
00:21:54,273 --> 00:21:55,607
What? Sorry?

251
00:21:56,275 --> 00:21:57,985
Brigadier General Marks?

252
00:21:58,402 --> 00:22:01,154
Special representative to the
joint congressional committee on

253
00:22:01,321 --> 00:22:03,907
military appropriation,
Bill Marks?

254
00:22:04,825 --> 00:22:06,368
He was colonel Bill Mark back
then.

255
00:22:08,745 --> 00:22:12,833
Under his orders, we were sent
to a little village called

256
00:22:12,833 --> 00:22:13,959
Las Calinas.

257
00:22:15,294 --> 00:22:17,838
The village has just a few
huts.

258
00:22:25,637 --> 00:22:28,182
dinelo Chicon is suppose to be
hiding out there.

259
00:22:33,604 --> 00:22:35,147
It was suppose to be routine.

260
00:22:46,491 --> 00:22:47,534
Somebody lost it.

261
00:22:49,244 --> 00:22:50,370
I hear gun fire.

262
00:22:51,622 --> 00:22:55,709
By the time I get to there,
9 people are slaughtered.

263
00:22:56,001 --> 00:22:58,212
And god damn.

264
00:23:00,422 --> 00:23:02,883
They were all women, men, kids,

265
00:23:03,300 --> 00:23:05,594
and I lost it.

266
00:23:06,970 --> 00:23:09,014
I jumped the guy who did it..

267
00:23:09,848 --> 00:23:13,685
And the next thing I know, I'm
looking at first degree, 9 specs.

268
00:23:14,645 --> 00:23:15,854
Who did it?

269
00:23:16,063 --> 00:23:17,481
Hernandez.

270
00:23:18,315 --> 00:23:19,691
Jimmy Hernandez.

271
00:23:20,526 --> 00:23:22,277
He ordered me to keep my mouth
shut.

272
00:23:22,277 --> 00:23:24,488
He said he was teaching them a
lesson and Mark will back him up

273
00:23:25,989 --> 00:23:27,199
I told them to go to hell.

274
00:23:27,783 --> 00:23:29,910
Major Hernandez?
Marks's top aide?

275
00:23:30,369 --> 00:23:30,911
Yes.

276
00:23:33,539 --> 00:23:36,667
He introduced himself to me
yesterday in the waiting area.

277
00:23:37,543 --> 00:23:38,544
What?

278
00:23:45,717 --> 00:23:47,302
Claire, I want you to listen to
me.

279
00:23:47,636 --> 00:23:49,304
I want you to stay away from
him.

280
00:23:49,471 --> 00:23:51,431
He is extremely dangerous,
do you understand?

281
00:23:51,682 --> 00:23:56,520
General Marks, he is like the
most decorated most powerful?

282
00:23:59,231 --> 00:24:03,277
And you're saying you were
framed by General Marks and his

283
00:24:03,277 --> 00:24:04,486
special assistant.

284
00:24:06,697 --> 00:24:08,490
That is our defense?

285
00:24:10,033 --> 00:24:11,159
Yup.

286
00:24:20,127 --> 00:24:21,920
Claire, sit down for a minute.

287
00:24:22,546 --> 00:24:26,466
I don't want the firm's name to
be connected to this.

288
00:24:28,719 --> 00:24:31,305
Nobody knows Ron Chatman is
Tom Kubik.

289
00:24:31,638 --> 00:24:33,056
Alex, my husband is innocent.

290
00:24:33,348 --> 00:24:34,725
I'm not considering any other
possibility.

291
00:24:35,058 --> 00:24:37,477
I'm even less interested than
you are in seeing his name

292
00:24:37,477 --> 00:24:38,812
associated with a mass murder.

293
00:24:41,398 --> 00:24:43,400
I just want you to understand.

294
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:45,444
All the possible unforeseen
consequences.

295
00:24:45,652 --> 00:24:47,237
I'll make it really easy for you.

296
00:24:47,321 --> 00:24:48,906
If the firm's name got dragged
into this, you don't have to

297
00:24:48,906 --> 00:24:50,490
fire me. I'll resign.

298
00:24:51,742 --> 00:24:53,452
Hei, Josh, remember that thing
from the twenty?

299
00:24:55,078 --> 00:24:55,662
Thank you.

300
00:24:56,580 --> 00:24:57,915
Claire can I do anything?

301
00:24:58,081 --> 00:24:59,416
Yeah, I need a lawyer.

302
00:25:00,459 --> 00:25:01,710
Somebody from the marine corps.

303
00:25:02,628 --> 00:25:04,755
Somebody who beat them before
and hungry to beat them again.

304
00:25:05,297 --> 00:25:06,298
Where will you be?

305
00:26:04,022 --> 00:26:07,359
Bill, bill, William.

306
00:26:13,365 --> 00:26:16,535
I'm looking for Charlie Grimes.

307
00:26:19,454 --> 00:26:21,665
don't tell me you need a lawyer
because you are one.

308
00:26:23,792 --> 00:26:25,335
I followed the Norris case.

309
00:26:26,420 --> 00:26:27,838
Talk about a rabbit out of a
hat.

310
00:26:28,755 --> 00:26:30,507
Are you Charles W. Grimes?

311
00:26:31,091 --> 00:26:33,260
You just can't get over my
decorating, can you?

312
00:26:34,011 --> 00:26:35,637
Welcome to Grimes and associate.

313
00:26:36,096 --> 00:26:36,847
Associate?

314
00:26:38,015 --> 00:26:38,849
Laila.

315
00:26:41,935 --> 00:26:43,854
Rumour has it that you are a
very good attorney.

316
00:26:44,354 --> 00:26:45,689
Formerly of the Jag Corps.

317
00:26:47,274 --> 00:26:48,192
In another life.

318
00:26:49,026 --> 00:26:51,028
And in that former life you
were having an affair with your

319
00:26:51,236 --> 00:26:52,654
superior's wife,
and they pushed you out.

320
00:26:53,030 --> 00:26:55,949
Let's not dwell on my youthful
offences, what do you want?

321
00:26:56,283 --> 00:26:57,993
The military has set up my
husband.

322
00:26:58,994 --> 00:27:01,872
And they assign some junior
lieutenant to defend him.

323
00:27:02,539 --> 00:27:03,999
Who is prosecuting?

324
00:27:03,999 --> 00:27:05,125
Waldron.

325
00:27:08,587 --> 00:27:10,047
Tell your husband to cop a
plea.

326
00:27:10,422 --> 00:27:11,882
Try to make a deal with the judge.

327
00:27:12,174 --> 00:27:15,928
Military justice is different.

328
00:27:16,178 --> 00:27:17,346
Wake up. Smell the napalm.

329
00:27:18,096 --> 00:27:20,140
Charlie, you're not gonna
believe this shit!

330
00:27:20,349 --> 00:27:21,725
They busted me again.

331
00:27:22,726 --> 00:27:23,477
It's like?

332
00:27:24,144 --> 00:27:27,898
every time I turn around,
they slapped hand cuffs on me.

333
00:27:28,315 --> 00:27:30,526
That's because every time you
turn around, you made some

334
00:27:30,526 --> 00:27:31,527
fault.

335
00:27:33,862 --> 00:27:36,782
I perform a very important
service for the military.

336
00:27:37,282 --> 00:27:38,700
That's her denial defense.

337
00:27:39,284 --> 00:27:40,827
You do somebody at the base
too?

338
00:27:41,745 --> 00:27:43,121
Yeah, actually.

339
00:27:44,498 --> 00:27:46,458
How about your lawyer here,
is he any good?

340
00:27:46,959 --> 00:27:48,335
When he gets up his ass, yeah.

341
00:27:50,379 --> 00:27:51,922
How about it Mr. Grimes?

342
00:27:52,965 --> 00:27:55,217
Why don't you sit up?

343
00:27:55,384 --> 00:27:56,301
Nice to meet you, Lola.

344
00:27:56,301 --> 00:27:57,886
I'm due for in an hour.
-In an hour?

345
00:28:17,656 --> 00:28:18,740
Jackie.

346
00:28:19,283 --> 00:28:20,576
I'm here to help.

347
00:28:20,576 --> 00:28:22,911
'Cause, what are sisters for?

348
00:28:26,582 --> 00:28:27,708
Tacky.

349
00:28:29,501 --> 00:28:31,003
You got evicted didn't you?

350
00:28:31,003 --> 00:28:33,046
What happen to the money I
send?

351
00:28:33,380 --> 00:28:35,549
Too little, too late, too much
credit card debts.

352
00:28:36,175 --> 00:28:37,467
All I need is an extra phone
line.

353
00:28:37,467 --> 00:28:38,385
What for?

354
00:28:38,385 --> 00:28:39,803
Find new job.

355
00:28:39,803 --> 00:28:41,513
Psychic hotline.

356
00:28:41,513 --> 00:28:44,016
don't laugh, I'm really good at
it.

357
00:29:15,714 --> 00:29:16,548
Good morning, Lieutenant.

358
00:29:16,548 --> 00:29:17,966
Good morning Mrs. Kubik.

359
00:29:22,679 --> 00:29:23,680
Hei.

360
00:29:23,722 --> 00:29:25,182
Madam.
-Madam.

361
00:29:26,183 --> 00:29:28,268
did you see that,
he just call me madam.

362
00:29:29,144 --> 00:29:29,937
Shall we?

363
00:29:30,687 --> 00:29:32,189
Yeah, let's get out of here.

364
00:29:35,317 --> 00:29:37,194
So, I do not need any security
clearance for the pre-trial

365
00:29:37,194 --> 00:29:37,819
portion.

366
00:29:37,819 --> 00:29:39,029
Yes, exactly.

367
00:29:39,029 --> 00:29:40,781
The only portion of the trial
that are classified or those

368
00:29:40,781 --> 00:29:43,325
pertaining directly to the
incident in El Salvador.

369
00:29:46,828 --> 00:29:50,374
I hope she didn't think I was
starring.

370
00:29:50,374 --> 00:29:51,458
Who?

371
00:29:51,458 --> 00:29:53,377
Your sister.

372
00:29:53,377 --> 00:29:55,128
Well, don't worry about it,
she understand.

373
00:29:55,128 --> 00:29:57,172
She is psychic.

374
00:30:02,219 --> 00:30:05,347
Mr. Grimes decided to join us
after all.

375
00:30:06,723 --> 00:30:10,227
Mrs. Kubik, Charlie has a
history of being a major drunk.

376
00:30:20,404 --> 00:30:21,655
Are you sober, Mr. Grimes?

377
00:30:24,283 --> 00:30:26,493
462 days, Mrs. Kubik.

378
00:30:26,910 --> 00:30:30,789
Pre-trial plan? Fill me in.

379
00:30:31,248 --> 00:30:32,374
Pre-trial in 10.

380
00:30:32,583 --> 00:30:33,750
10 what?

381
00:30:34,084 --> 00:30:35,002
10 minutes.

382
00:30:38,172 --> 00:30:39,173
What?

383
00:30:42,551 --> 00:30:44,511
You don't think they'll be
impressed by leather?

384
00:30:50,976 --> 00:30:51,977
Who is the judge?

385
00:30:51,977 --> 00:30:53,478
Colonel Farrell.

386
00:30:54,521 --> 00:30:55,898
Yeah, it would be.

387
00:31:01,278 --> 00:31:03,614
Piss all over it because we are
civilian.

388
00:31:04,615 --> 00:31:06,992
And he won't give a shit about
the reverses down the line.

389
00:31:07,284 --> 00:31:09,119
Because he is about ready to
retire.

390
00:31:09,953 --> 00:31:10,996
Have you file any motion?

391
00:31:11,455 --> 00:31:13,165
I'll duly dismiss all charges
due to insufficient evidence.

392
00:31:13,165 --> 00:31:14,666
Motion denied.

393
00:31:14,666 --> 00:31:15,918
You haven't even read the
brief.

394
00:31:15,918 --> 00:31:17,461
No doubt, neither has Farrell.

395
00:31:17,461 --> 00:31:21,173
The whole military judicial
system is based on denial.

396
00:31:21,173 --> 00:31:22,299
Can we fight the system?

397
00:31:22,299 --> 00:31:23,091
No.

398
00:31:24,801 --> 00:31:26,136
We play by the rule.

399
00:31:26,136 --> 00:31:27,346
do not fight the system.

400
00:31:27,346 --> 00:31:30,140
You fight the system,
you loose.

401
00:31:30,140 --> 00:31:31,642
Isn't that right, Embry?

402
00:31:32,893 --> 00:31:33,519
Say yes sir.

403
00:31:33,519 --> 00:31:34,686
Yes, sir.

404
00:31:35,187 --> 00:31:36,396
don't be a sap, Embry.

405
00:31:37,022 --> 00:31:39,024
Nobody in uniform can think for
himself.

406
00:31:39,525 --> 00:31:42,528
This is a pre-trial hearing.
The goal is to listen,

407
00:31:42,528 --> 00:31:43,946
and not to reveal anything.

408
00:31:44,363 --> 00:31:46,365
do we have anything to reveal,
Mrs. Kubik?

409
00:31:46,365 --> 00:31:47,741
Claire.
-Claire?

410
00:31:47,741 --> 00:31:49,034
No.
-No?

411
00:31:49,201 --> 00:31:50,536
Than that ought to work.

412
00:32:03,173 --> 00:32:04,591
Which one is the prosecutor?

413
00:32:04,591 --> 00:32:07,469
We call them trial council.

414
00:32:07,678 --> 00:32:09,388
Mrs. Kubik, I'm Major Waldron.

415
00:32:09,388 --> 00:32:10,848
How do you do?

416
00:32:10,848 --> 00:32:12,516
Hi, Luther.

417
00:32:15,352 --> 00:32:16,687
Nice to see you.

418
00:32:16,687 --> 00:32:17,521
Bullshit.

419
00:32:18,814 --> 00:32:20,482
All rise.

420
00:32:27,948 --> 00:32:28,574
Be sitted.

421
00:32:30,659 --> 00:32:33,537
Court in session, call to
order.

422
00:32:33,704 --> 00:32:36,415
I'm Colonel Farrell.
U.S. marine corps.

423
00:32:36,415 --> 00:32:38,208
Where is the accuse?

424
00:32:55,392 --> 00:32:57,311
Charlie Grimes.

425
00:32:58,061 --> 00:32:59,188
I'll explain later.

426
00:33:05,569 --> 00:33:07,404
Sergeant Chatman, you've seen
the charges against you,

427
00:33:07,404 --> 00:33:08,405
how do you plea?

428
00:33:08,405 --> 00:33:12,409
Before that, can you dismiss
all my client charges?

429
00:33:12,409 --> 00:33:13,452
Motion denied.

430
00:33:13,452 --> 00:33:15,579
Since you are unfamiliar with
system of our court.

431
00:33:15,579 --> 00:33:17,623
We don't have clients here.

432
00:33:17,623 --> 00:33:19,499
Sergeant Ron Chatman have been
accused, and I'm still waiting

433
00:33:19,499 --> 00:33:21,251
for the plea.

434
00:33:23,295 --> 00:33:24,963
I plea not guilty.

435
00:33:25,380 --> 00:33:26,590
Not guilty.

436
00:33:26,924 --> 00:33:28,258
You may be sitted.

437
00:33:30,260 --> 00:33:34,932
The court rules does not allow
the accuse being represented by

438
00:33:34,932 --> 00:33:36,183
his spouse.

439
00:33:38,185 --> 00:33:39,394
Thank you, your honour.

440
00:33:39,603 --> 00:33:42,397
Prosecutor request short
pre-trial period to ensure

441
00:33:42,397 --> 00:33:43,482
security.

442
00:33:43,482 --> 00:33:44,483
Granted.

443
00:33:44,483 --> 00:33:46,652
Opening statement is scheduled
for 1 week from today.

444
00:33:46,652 --> 00:33:47,945
Objection!

445
00:33:47,945 --> 00:33:51,281
There's no way we can prepare
for defense in 1 week.

446
00:33:51,782 --> 00:33:53,951
That is the rule. Are we done?

447
00:33:54,243 --> 00:33:58,330
The defense has no intention
of waiving a public trial.

448
00:34:00,791 --> 00:34:03,627
This case involved national
security and classified

449
00:34:03,627 --> 00:34:04,545
information.

450
00:34:04,545 --> 00:34:08,090
We would like to defend this
from spreading by the media.

451
00:34:11,134 --> 00:34:13,345
We are civilian and not
subject to military order.

452
00:34:14,221 --> 00:34:16,640
Such order will be taken for
informational personal purposes

453
00:34:16,640 --> 00:34:17,599
only.

454
00:34:21,478 --> 00:34:23,814
You still can be disqualified
from participating this trial.

455
00:34:24,189 --> 00:34:26,066
All rise.

456
00:34:35,742 --> 00:34:36,994
So it begins.

457
00:34:37,661 --> 00:34:38,662
See you soon.

458
00:34:40,873 --> 00:34:42,332
He is suppose to be the best.

459
00:34:46,879 --> 00:34:47,880
What the hell was that?

460
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:51,717
I said you should follow the
rule.

461
00:34:52,259 --> 00:34:53,177
I'm the wild card.

462
00:34:53,385 --> 00:34:54,761
You could have got us thrown
out from the case.

463
00:34:54,887 --> 00:34:55,888
That's too early..

464
00:34:56,597 --> 00:34:59,558
If they think we're gonna go
public, it might give us an idea

465
00:34:59,558 --> 00:35:00,809
how scare they are.

466
00:35:01,310 --> 00:35:02,436
What do you think, Embry?

467
00:35:02,769 --> 00:35:05,981
I think why me, why I was
assigned to this case.

468
00:35:09,568 --> 00:35:13,030
7 guys in Tom's unit and all of
them said he did it.

469
00:35:13,655 --> 00:35:16,283
But only two of these
eyewitnesses are on their list.

470
00:35:16,992 --> 00:35:19,286
What happened to the other
five?

471
00:35:19,745 --> 00:35:20,495
dead.

472
00:35:21,788 --> 00:35:22,581
All of them?

473
00:35:23,540 --> 00:35:24,875
dead how?

474
00:35:26,043 --> 00:35:27,586
Two were killed in combat.

475
00:35:27,878 --> 00:35:31,048
One was murdered,
and the other two accidents.

476
00:35:32,883 --> 00:35:33,884
Accidents?

477
00:35:35,135 --> 00:35:37,804
I know a couple of P.I.s, ex-Green Berets.

478
00:35:38,472 --> 00:35:42,267
Not very ethical, but maybe
they can give us the unofficial

479
00:35:42,267 --> 00:35:43,852
version of their death.

480
00:35:45,062 --> 00:35:46,396
Could be useful.

481
00:35:47,189 --> 00:35:49,650
Here we go. Troy Abbott,
Sacramento, California.

482
00:35:49,650 --> 00:35:52,569
doing 4 to 6 for arm robbery.

483
00:35:53,529 --> 00:35:57,908
Waldron's office is trying to
extradite his parol.

484
00:35:58,909 --> 00:36:00,577
Why am I certain he is going to
succeed?

485
00:36:00,953 --> 00:36:03,539
'Cause it's the marine corps.
Be all you can be.

486
00:36:03,914 --> 00:36:05,374
That's charming.

487
00:36:07,584 --> 00:36:10,879
I think maybe Hernandez acting
alone.

488
00:36:11,839 --> 00:36:14,424
No one is gonna believe
General Marks was in this.

489
00:36:15,008 --> 00:36:17,052
In other words,
you don't believe it.

490
00:36:19,096 --> 00:36:20,931
That is not my point.

491
00:36:21,515 --> 00:36:23,141
do you believe Tom or not?

492
00:36:23,767 --> 00:36:26,770
Easy, he is just expressing his
opinion.

493
00:36:26,937 --> 00:36:29,064
Isn't there something you
should be doing some where else?

494
00:36:29,606 --> 00:36:30,732
Not really.

495
00:36:33,443 --> 00:36:34,736
Can I get you another coffee?

496
00:36:35,571 --> 00:36:37,072
No, madam, I'm good.

497
00:36:45,622 --> 00:36:47,249
I have to agree with Embry.

498
00:36:47,708 --> 00:36:51,962
Guy like Marks smells, looks,
tastes creditable.

499
00:36:52,296 --> 00:36:55,132
Put him on the stands, he'll
just give Hernandez credibility.

500
00:36:55,299 --> 00:36:56,800
Right, that's what I'm saying.

501
00:36:56,967 --> 00:36:59,469
Well, the young man has an
original thought.

502
00:36:59,469 --> 00:37:01,054
You know what?

503
00:37:01,054 --> 00:37:02,264
What?
-Is that my phone?

504
00:37:02,264 --> 00:37:03,557
No.
-Go to hell.

505
00:37:03,557 --> 00:37:05,225
Another one.

506
00:37:08,020 --> 00:37:09,771
Yes I'll hold for Major
Waldron.

507
00:37:13,108 --> 00:37:14,568
Hello, Major.

508
00:37:18,989 --> 00:37:20,240
We'll be there.

509
00:37:23,744 --> 00:37:24,995
I can't believe it.

510
00:37:24,995 --> 00:37:26,538
They want a deal.

511
00:37:27,372 --> 00:37:28,707
I love being a wild card.

512
00:37:33,003 --> 00:37:36,089
Voluntary manslaughter is only
one specification,

513
00:37:36,298 --> 00:37:37,591
and only 5 years.

514
00:37:38,008 --> 00:37:40,969
Plus one condition you sign a
non-disclosure agreement.

515
00:37:41,845 --> 00:37:43,138
As your council I?

516
00:37:44,556 --> 00:37:46,767
Tell the man to take the deal
of the century.

517
00:37:49,353 --> 00:37:50,646
Sweetheart.
-Honey.

518
00:37:50,979 --> 00:37:54,024
I won't do 5 minutes for the
crime I didn't commit.

519
00:37:54,775 --> 00:37:56,777
do you have any idea any of
you?

520
00:37:56,944 --> 00:37:59,363
do you have any idea what it's
like to spend 23 hours a day in

521
00:37:59,363 --> 00:38:00,697
a 6 by 8 cell?

522
00:38:02,032 --> 00:38:06,328
5 years, they'll make sure I'm
dead long before that.

523
00:38:08,914 --> 00:38:11,041
Motion denied.

524
00:38:24,054 --> 00:38:24,847
Come on in.

525
00:38:25,013 --> 00:38:27,140
Based on our conversation?

526
00:38:28,058 --> 00:38:30,143
We here to tell you we're gonna
pass.

527
00:38:31,186 --> 00:38:32,145
Thanks anyway.

528
00:38:39,403 --> 00:38:42,030
Personally I'm quite happy to
go to trial with this case.

529
00:38:42,197 --> 00:38:44,324
There's a lot of interest
in putting this behind us.

530
00:38:44,533 --> 00:38:45,826
They work for everyone.

531
00:38:45,826 --> 00:38:47,578
Command and your husband.

532
00:38:47,744 --> 00:38:50,831
And Major Hernandez and
General Marks.

533
00:38:51,039 --> 00:38:52,124
See you in court, sir.

534
00:39:06,388 --> 00:39:08,098
So, no deal.

535
00:39:08,432 --> 00:39:11,059
Can you believe I ask my
husband to do 5 years in prison?

536
00:39:12,227 --> 00:39:13,729
Go ahead?

537
00:39:14,396 --> 00:39:17,024
tell me what a waste of
oxygen all lawyers are.

538
00:39:25,282 --> 00:39:27,367
You are curiously quiet on the
subject.

539
00:39:31,622 --> 00:39:34,291
Jackie, would you please turn
that down? I mean come on?

540
00:39:42,257 --> 00:39:45,135
Your husband came to my village
and killed my family.

541
00:39:45,302 --> 00:39:46,929
And it's true.

542
00:39:47,137 --> 00:39:48,972
Lawyers are a waste of oxygen.

543
00:39:49,556 --> 00:39:51,266
drop this deal.

544
00:40:06,448 --> 00:40:08,075
He went out!

545
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:11,787
Claire, are you okay?

546
00:40:18,460 --> 00:40:19,002
Bastard!

547
00:40:20,796 --> 00:40:22,130
It's Hernandez.

548
00:40:25,133 --> 00:40:27,386
We turn down their deal and
they try to scare us.

549
00:40:28,470 --> 00:40:29,930
You don't know how this people
work.

550
00:40:30,889 --> 00:40:32,516
I don't know how any of those
work.

551
00:40:33,976 --> 00:40:35,352
What do you mean?

552
00:40:35,352 --> 00:40:37,521
This ther life of your.

553
00:40:39,022 --> 00:40:40,440
You don't believe me do you?

554
00:40:40,566 --> 00:40:42,484
Of course I believe you.

555
00:40:43,318 --> 00:40:44,820
I'll take a polygraf.

556
00:40:45,654 --> 00:40:47,823
It's not even admissible in
court.

557
00:40:48,031 --> 00:40:50,534
To hell with the court.
I want to do it for us.

558
00:40:54,872 --> 00:40:55,914
Hey, Ron.

559
00:40:56,164 --> 00:40:59,459
Or Tommy, or whatever it is?

560
00:41:00,919 --> 00:41:02,588
I just come here to help.

561
00:41:02,754 --> 00:41:04,089
What are you doing here?

562
00:41:04,089 --> 00:41:05,966
You ought to plea this out.

563
00:41:05,966 --> 00:41:07,342
Major, no!

564
00:41:07,342 --> 00:41:08,427
Stop!

565
00:41:18,437 --> 00:41:19,354
Hold on!

566
00:41:19,646 --> 00:41:21,356
Who let Major Hernandez in
here?

567
00:41:21,481 --> 00:41:23,442
He is not suppose to be in
here.

568
00:41:24,359 --> 00:41:26,111
He is provoking my client.

569
00:41:26,570 --> 00:41:28,238
Who is in charge?
Who let him in here?

570
00:41:28,363 --> 00:41:30,699
He is not suppose to be in
here.

571
00:41:30,699 --> 00:41:32,534
Major Hernandez says he is a
defense witness.

572
00:41:32,534 --> 00:41:34,244
He is not a witness for the
defense!

573
00:41:34,244 --> 00:41:36,121
Who is in charge?

574
00:41:36,121 --> 00:41:39,082
I want to talk to whoever is in charge!

575
00:41:43,086 --> 00:41:44,755
Is your real name Ron Chatman?

576
00:41:44,755 --> 00:41:46,089
Yes.

577
00:41:46,089 --> 00:41:46,924
Yes.

578
00:41:56,099 --> 00:42:01,522
did you participate in the
death of anyone in 15-3-1988?

579
00:42:23,627 --> 00:42:24,837
You passed.

580
00:42:25,295 --> 00:42:26,588
Of course I passed.

581
00:42:35,097 --> 00:42:36,765
Are we being monitored?

582
00:42:36,974 --> 00:42:37,808
No.

583
00:42:37,975 --> 00:42:39,726
It absolutely secured.

584
00:42:40,352 --> 00:42:41,937
Absolutely secured?

585
00:42:43,480 --> 00:42:45,107
What do you mean?

586
00:42:46,817 --> 00:42:48,944
What do you think I mean?

587
00:43:14,636 --> 00:43:16,805
And Lieutenant Colonel?

588
00:43:17,973 --> 00:43:22,186
Were there any eyewitnesses to
this massacre?

589
00:43:22,811 --> 00:43:23,687
Yes.

590
00:43:23,687 --> 00:43:25,272
We have 7 eyewitnesses'
statements.

591
00:43:25,272 --> 00:43:27,149
All saying Ron is the shooter.

592
00:43:27,482 --> 00:43:28,400
Thank you.

593
00:43:29,318 --> 00:43:30,611
Nothing further, your honour.

594
00:43:45,834 --> 00:43:49,546
You were and still are special
agent in charge of this

595
00:43:49,546 --> 00:43:53,091
criminal investigation?

596
00:43:53,091 --> 00:43:54,384
That's correct.

597
00:43:54,384 --> 00:43:57,763
So, when you said the
investigation were not flawed,

598
00:43:57,763 --> 00:44:00,724
you basically were giving
yourself a big thumb up.

599
00:44:02,267 --> 00:44:04,144
I am just expressing my
opinion.

600
00:44:04,436 --> 00:44:06,396
So help you God, no doubt.

601
00:44:08,315 --> 00:44:12,569
Is it possible that this
witnesses were coached before

602
00:44:12,569 --> 00:44:14,363
you got your hands on them?

603
00:44:14,363 --> 00:44:16,740
I guess it is possible.
But unlikely.

604
00:44:17,908 --> 00:44:21,495
And are you aware that 2 of the
witnesses were subsequently

605
00:44:21,495 --> 00:44:23,997
killed in combat?

606
00:44:24,414 --> 00:44:25,874
Yes, I'm aware of that.

607
00:44:26,416 --> 00:44:31,880
And another 3 relatively young
men have die as well?

608
00:44:32,339 --> 00:44:33,090
Yes.

609
00:44:35,300 --> 00:44:38,387
That was Lieutenant Alan,
hit and run.

610
00:44:39,263 --> 00:44:43,392
Sergeant Spencer,
accidental drowning.

611
00:44:44,643 --> 00:44:47,521
And the other the unfortunate
mountain climbing fall.

612
00:44:48,438 --> 00:44:50,399
That sounds right.
-does it?

613
00:44:51,650 --> 00:44:53,527
That is interesting.

614
00:44:54,403 --> 00:44:57,364
I just made up those causes of
death.

615
00:44:58,574 --> 00:45:02,077
I mean there were no
accidental drowning,

616
00:45:02,077 --> 00:45:04,496
no mountain climbing fall.

617
00:45:05,455 --> 00:45:08,166
I do have the details about
these tragic deaths.

618
00:45:08,166 --> 00:45:11,378
Including a fatal home invasion
robbery. Look at them.

619
00:45:14,131 --> 00:45:16,633
I'm a little fuzzy on the
details.

620
00:45:17,134 --> 00:45:18,802
I wasn't in charge in those
investigations.

621
00:45:18,802 --> 00:45:20,137
No further question.

622
00:45:20,721 --> 00:45:22,764
My investigation was strictly..
-No further question.

623
00:45:27,186 --> 00:45:29,438
Hello?
-Claire, it's Charlie.

624
00:45:29,688 --> 00:45:31,648
You know the witness in Tom's
unit that was murdered?

625
00:45:31,940 --> 00:45:33,775
Yeah, home invasion robbery.

626
00:45:33,901 --> 00:45:36,028
He was killed right in front of
his wife.

627
00:45:36,945 --> 00:45:40,032
And she accused that the
military had involved.

628
00:45:41,325 --> 00:45:42,910
Will she talk to us?

629
00:45:43,035 --> 00:45:45,746
The problem is, she disappear
right after that.

630
00:46:04,932 --> 00:46:06,892
Is this a bad time?
-No.

631
00:46:07,976 --> 00:46:10,312
I was thinking we could go over
to Hernandez's cross.

632
00:46:10,521 --> 00:46:12,231
I was just taking a break.

633
00:46:13,815 --> 00:46:15,901
Going over Hernandez's stuff
myself.

634
00:46:19,947 --> 00:46:21,156
Please don't be mad.

635
00:46:21,156 --> 00:46:22,783
It wasn't him, it was all me.

636
00:46:22,824 --> 00:46:25,452
This doesn't affect anything,
okay?

637
00:46:25,827 --> 00:46:28,580
My work 'm totally up for it.

638
00:46:30,832 --> 00:46:33,836
Yes. We were just going over
his briefs.

639
00:46:39,049 --> 00:46:41,134
You never can take anything
seriously, can you?

640
00:46:41,385 --> 00:46:44,346
Nothing! Ever!
-Oh, yeah. That's right.

641
00:46:44,346 --> 00:46:47,808
You got to be a lawyer,
I got to bang one, right?

642
00:47:30,767 --> 00:47:32,269
We are closed.

643
00:47:32,269 --> 00:47:33,228
Closed.

644
00:47:39,318 --> 00:47:39,651
We are closed.

645
00:47:39,693 --> 00:47:43,030
Excuse me, can you tell me how
to get to Strick street?

646
00:47:43,155 --> 00:47:44,531
Sure, 2 blocks down.

647
00:47:44,531 --> 00:47:45,908
Thank you.

648
00:48:03,467 --> 00:48:04,885
Want some cheese?

649
00:48:06,220 --> 00:48:08,347
Yeah. I can make an omelette.

650
00:48:08,472 --> 00:48:09,890
I'll make one.

651
00:48:10,307 --> 00:48:12,476
You want Cheddar, American,
Swiss.

652
00:48:13,268 --> 00:48:14,269
Cheddar is good.

653
00:48:15,395 --> 00:48:17,314
Mrs. Chatman.

654
00:48:20,150 --> 00:48:21,235
It's Kubik.

655
00:48:21,401 --> 00:48:22,694
Okay, Mrs. Kubik.

656
00:48:22,861 --> 00:48:24,571
I wanna tell you what I do for
my living.

657
00:48:24,947 --> 00:48:26,114
This sicko bothering you?

658
00:48:26,406 --> 00:48:27,950
'Cause I know how to handle this
kind of weirdo.

659
00:48:29,910 --> 00:48:31,495
I teach guy to beat the
box.

660
00:48:33,163 --> 00:48:33,872
Who are you?

661
00:48:34,456 --> 00:48:37,251
I teach anyone how to beat the
polygraf.

662
00:48:37,584 --> 00:48:40,087
Like special operation
personnel.

663
00:48:44,174 --> 00:48:46,552
I teach people how to create a
new persona.

664
00:48:48,303 --> 00:48:51,557
That way when they lie,
they're not really lying.

665
00:48:53,725 --> 00:48:55,143
Why are you telling me this?

666
00:48:55,811 --> 00:48:57,145
I don't know.

667
00:48:57,437 --> 00:48:58,897
But my guess is you do.

668
00:48:59,565 --> 00:49:00,983
Who are you, who send you?

669
00:49:01,233 --> 00:49:03,151
I was asked to convey this
message to you.

670
00:49:06,655 --> 00:49:07,990
Good night Mrs. Kubik.

671
00:49:08,323 --> 00:49:09,741
Get out of here.

672
00:49:22,838 --> 00:49:24,590
Is it true?

673
00:49:25,257 --> 00:49:26,049
What?

674
00:49:26,675 --> 00:49:28,510
That you get that kind of
training?

675
00:49:28,510 --> 00:49:30,012
To beat the box.

676
00:49:30,512 --> 00:49:31,430
What are you talking about?

677
00:49:31,430 --> 00:49:33,182
The polygraf , Tom.

678
00:49:35,017 --> 00:49:37,936
Sure.
But I didn't beat the box.

679
00:49:37,936 --> 00:49:38,979
I told the truth.

680
00:49:38,979 --> 00:49:41,190
Why didn't you tell me you
could do that?

681
00:49:41,523 --> 00:49:43,317
It doesn't occurred to me.

682
00:49:43,400 --> 00:49:45,527
That's not part of who I am
anymore.

683
00:49:45,527 --> 00:49:47,321
That's it, isn't it?

684
00:49:48,864 --> 00:49:50,532
How do I know who you are?

685
00:49:50,866 --> 00:49:53,869
You the only one who knows who
I am.

686
00:50:08,383 --> 00:50:09,885
I don't care anymore.

687
00:50:10,719 --> 00:50:11,637
I did it.

688
00:50:12,012 --> 00:50:13,222
I shot them all.

689
00:50:14,723 --> 00:50:16,183
For fun, why not?

690
00:50:16,558 --> 00:50:18,060
Who the hell cares, Claire?

691
00:50:18,560 --> 00:50:23,315
The man you've been waking up
to just love to kill women and

692
00:50:23,440 --> 00:50:24,733
children.

693
00:50:24,733 --> 00:50:26,193
In cold blood.

694
00:50:28,529 --> 00:50:30,364
Who the hell knows why, Claire?

695
00:50:30,906 --> 00:50:32,866
Am I making any sense?

696
00:50:34,243 --> 00:50:36,828
do what I'm saying make any
sense to you?

697
00:50:38,789 --> 00:50:39,831
No.

698
00:50:54,012 --> 00:50:55,264
I'm scared.

699
00:50:57,349 --> 00:51:02,896
You know me more than
that.

700
00:51:11,947 --> 00:51:14,491
Tell me how do they know,
Charlie?

701
00:51:14,491 --> 00:51:16,285
How do they know?

702
00:51:16,285 --> 00:51:18,161
Good question.

703
00:51:56,909 --> 00:51:58,202
It's been ages.

704
00:52:00,370 --> 00:52:02,289
You come for the leftovers?

705
00:52:02,289 --> 00:52:04,249
No, just want to look at your
trash.

706
00:53:15,571 --> 00:53:18,365
What's the problem?
Take it easy.

707
00:53:29,835 --> 00:53:30,752
Hold him.

708
00:53:40,929 --> 00:53:43,098
I just don't believe it.
I refused.

709
00:53:44,391 --> 00:53:47,060
The truth is less fun than the
truth.

710
00:53:47,811 --> 00:53:49,271
Tell me that you never do that.

711
00:53:49,313 --> 00:53:51,106
You're screwing him,
that means you know him?

712
00:53:51,356 --> 00:53:53,275
Excuse me, Mrs. Ron Chatman.

713
00:54:03,285 --> 00:54:04,453
What happened?

714
00:54:06,330 --> 00:54:08,123
You got lot of explaining to
do.

715
00:54:08,498 --> 00:54:10,125
You alright? Who did this?

716
00:54:11,251 --> 00:54:13,253
Some of the old gang down the
club.

717
00:54:14,087 --> 00:54:17,216
Same group that know every move
we made.

718
00:54:17,633 --> 00:54:19,593
What are you talking about?

719
00:54:19,843 --> 00:54:21,887
I didn't know about the
polygraf.

720
00:54:23,388 --> 00:54:25,724
Were you drinking with them?

721
00:54:26,350 --> 00:54:29,728
Every Friday, everybody drinks,
we don't talk about cases.

722
00:54:31,104 --> 00:54:33,607
Charlie you know what it's
like.

723
00:54:35,734 --> 00:54:37,444
Claire you can understand.

724
00:54:37,444 --> 00:54:39,029
I understand you're fired.

725
00:54:39,029 --> 00:54:40,531
What?

726
00:54:40,906 --> 00:54:43,283
Listen, this case will be over
and you'll be gone.

727
00:54:43,283 --> 00:54:43,992
But I'll still be here.

728
00:54:44,034 --> 00:54:44,868
did you know about this?

729
00:54:44,868 --> 00:54:45,661
What?

730
00:54:45,661 --> 00:54:48,789
did you know the attack on me
and Claire?

731
00:54:48,789 --> 00:54:50,165
Or is this just a coincidence?

732
00:54:50,165 --> 00:54:52,709
You seriously think I would do
this?

733
00:55:11,895 --> 00:55:13,522
What do you say we go to the
hospital?

734
00:55:13,772 --> 00:55:15,274
I am worry about your ribs.

735
00:55:15,607 --> 00:55:16,692
Just give me some ice.

736
00:55:18,443 --> 00:55:20,320
I won't be there for Hernandez.

737
00:55:20,821 --> 00:55:23,866
I got word Troy Abbott got his
parol.

738
00:55:25,659 --> 00:55:27,494
I gotta go track him down.

739
00:55:28,662 --> 00:55:30,664
I was kinda sick.

740
00:55:31,248 --> 00:55:33,041
Chatman taunted the victim.

741
00:55:33,208 --> 00:55:35,460
He tossed his gun around like
a cowboy.

742
00:55:36,211 --> 00:55:37,171
Kind of showing off.

743
00:55:37,171 --> 00:55:39,464
And then he executed them.

744
00:55:42,509 --> 00:55:43,594
Please continue.

745
00:55:45,971 --> 00:55:48,640
I ran to the south end of the
village but it was too late.

746
00:55:49,683 --> 00:55:51,059
They were all dead.

747
00:55:51,518 --> 00:55:52,936
And Chatman was still shooting.

748
00:55:59,318 --> 00:56:02,487
2 members of the unit assisted
me and we got him down.

749
00:56:08,035 --> 00:56:10,746
You said Chatman did some sick
things.

750
00:56:12,039 --> 00:56:15,542
Yet, you allow him to proceed
without any supervision?

751
00:56:16,251 --> 00:56:18,295
I didn't realize he take it
that far.

752
00:56:18,837 --> 00:56:21,423
Had Chatman been cited for this
kind of behaviour before?

753
00:56:21,423 --> 00:56:23,300
No.

754
00:56:23,717 --> 00:56:27,721
Isn't he the most experience
and reliable in the unit?

755
00:56:28,138 --> 00:56:31,683
Before you answer that,
a quote from a report you filed.

756
00:56:32,142 --> 00:56:33,894
defense's exhibit A.

757
00:56:34,811 --> 00:56:36,480
Chatman was a good marine.

758
00:56:36,480 --> 00:56:38,899
Courage, honest.

759
00:56:39,024 --> 00:56:40,234
I thought so.

760
00:56:40,234 --> 00:56:43,820
The kind of marine that will
not go along with a cover up.

761
00:56:43,820 --> 00:56:44,613
Objection.

762
00:56:44,613 --> 00:56:46,240
For you who actually committed
the killing.

763
00:56:46,240 --> 00:56:48,200
Objection!
-Sustained.

764
00:56:48,825 --> 00:56:50,786
Make that your last outburst.

765
00:56:51,620 --> 00:56:54,957
Jury members you are instructed
to disregard that accusation.

766
00:56:56,834 --> 00:57:00,546
How was it possible that 7 men
spread all over a village would

767
00:57:00,546 --> 00:57:02,756
witnessed the exact same thing?

768
00:57:03,257 --> 00:57:05,092
We all got to the barn at the
same time.

769
00:57:07,135 --> 00:57:08,178
How convenience.

770
00:57:10,097 --> 00:57:14,351
doesn't it make more sense that
some of them are order to lie?

771
00:57:16,311 --> 00:57:17,896
They were not ordered to lie.

772
00:57:17,896 --> 00:57:18,730
How did you know?

773
00:57:18,730 --> 00:57:20,649
I would know if something like
that happened to my men.

774
00:57:20,649 --> 00:57:22,776
And if something like that
happened to them, you would tell us?

775
00:57:22,776 --> 00:57:26,113
Of course,
I wouldn't lie about it.

776
00:57:28,282 --> 00:57:31,910
You were train to lie about
your clandestine operation.

777
00:57:32,327 --> 00:57:36,415
As I understand it,
you were trained to be the polygraf.

778
00:57:38,667 --> 00:57:40,961
Is that true you possed that
talent?

779
00:57:41,628 --> 00:57:44,464
I only use it when interrogated
by the enemy.

780
00:57:45,174 --> 00:57:47,217
That's good to know.

781
00:57:47,676 --> 00:57:49,136
So tell me this.

782
00:57:50,971 --> 00:57:53,473
do you consider me a friend?

783
00:58:10,991 --> 00:58:13,076
Hey, I ain't doin' no more.

784
00:58:13,076 --> 00:58:14,870
It's going to be time.

785
00:58:15,037 --> 00:58:17,998
You got that all wrong brother.
It ain't me.

786
00:58:18,874 --> 00:58:20,375
Should I be so lucky.

787
00:58:21,084 --> 00:58:24,796
I'm suppose to deliver this to
Troy Abbott?

788
00:58:25,380 --> 00:58:26,298
That you?

789
00:58:26,298 --> 00:58:27,341
Yeah, who from?

790
00:58:27,341 --> 00:58:29,259
From Jim Hernandez,
down the base.

791
00:58:30,010 --> 00:58:31,178
Hey, Charles.

792
00:58:32,262 --> 00:58:33,847
Grace, what are you doing here?

793
00:58:34,223 --> 00:58:35,599
I got a call from the base.

794
00:58:35,599 --> 00:58:36,850
You got a call?

795
00:58:36,850 --> 00:58:37,226
Yeap.

796
00:58:37,267 --> 00:58:38,894
Bullshit you got this call.

797
00:58:38,894 --> 00:58:41,230
What bitch, who you raising
that?

798
00:58:45,192 --> 00:58:46,652
Stop! Stop!

799
00:58:48,320 --> 00:58:50,239
Why you always getting into
trouble?

800
00:58:50,239 --> 00:58:52,032
Why you always trying to play
best?

801
00:58:52,282 --> 00:58:53,617
Now apologize to the man.

802
00:58:53,909 --> 00:58:55,118
I ain't going to apologize.

803
00:58:59,623 --> 00:59:02,000
do you want me to apologize,
baby?

804
00:59:09,049 --> 00:59:11,468
Grace is going to apologize
real good.

805
00:59:13,053 --> 00:59:14,054
do you?

806
00:59:16,682 --> 00:59:18,267
You want me to say sorry?

807
00:59:21,103 --> 00:59:22,938
So they parol you?

808
00:59:23,105 --> 00:59:26,775
Yeah. Then they bring me here
to testify.

809
00:59:28,110 --> 00:59:29,736
What really happened that day?

810
00:59:30,696 --> 00:59:32,155
I don't know. It was years ago.

811
00:59:32,698 --> 00:59:34,992
El Salvador some massacre shit.

812
00:59:35,951 --> 00:59:38,120
I bet some officers are on it too.

813
00:59:41,498 --> 00:59:42,958
You ain't thirsty?

814
00:59:43,500 --> 00:59:45,085
Yeah, sure.

815
00:59:45,377 --> 00:59:48,046
I'm just, chilling.

816
01:00:30,422 --> 01:00:32,883
What did you say back?

817
01:00:32,883 --> 01:00:34,426
Yeah, what did you say?

818
01:00:34,426 --> 01:00:36,053
Come on tell us.

819
01:00:36,345 --> 01:00:37,387
Come on.

820
01:00:37,387 --> 01:00:39,473
Alright, hey.

821
01:00:41,308 --> 01:00:42,351
What did you say?

822
01:00:43,519 --> 01:00:45,646
That I was no where near the
place.

823
01:00:46,063 --> 01:00:48,524
And they want me to say that I
saw this guy shooting.

824
01:00:49,691 --> 01:00:50,526
damn!

825
01:00:53,070 --> 01:00:54,321
You going to do it?

826
01:00:54,530 --> 01:00:57,199
I already did it in my
statement to the CId and I

827
01:00:57,199 --> 01:00:59,034
already testify to what I said.

828
01:00:59,743 --> 01:01:01,662
What CId?

829
01:01:01,912 --> 01:01:03,956
Criminal Investigation division.

830
01:01:05,207 --> 01:01:07,209
What about this poor guy?

831
01:01:07,376 --> 01:01:08,877
We get the poor guy.

832
01:01:09,795 --> 01:01:12,297
I mean what you gonna do?
Your XO comes up and say:

833
01:01:12,714 --> 01:01:14,633
You see Chatman shoot the bad
guy?

834
01:01:15,217 --> 01:01:16,802
You say, no sir, I didn't.

835
01:01:18,387 --> 01:01:21,014
He say be sure about this cause
you career is on the line.

836
01:01:21,890 --> 01:01:24,810
Everybody else say he did it
so I say what they want to hear.

837
01:01:25,352 --> 01:01:26,937
One more witness and there's no
difference.

838
01:01:27,437 --> 01:01:28,230
Right?

839
01:01:30,357 --> 01:01:31,024
Right.

840
01:02:53,357 --> 01:02:55,150
911 emergency situation.

841
01:02:55,150 --> 01:02:57,110
Yes, 10145.

842
01:02:57,110 --> 01:02:59,112
Alright now,
is this an emergency?

843
01:02:59,112 --> 01:03:01,240
There is somebody trying to get
into the house.

844
01:03:04,660 --> 01:03:05,744
Come on.

845
01:03:05,953 --> 01:03:07,996
No, it's ok, I'm sorry.

846
01:03:08,205 --> 01:03:10,791
Yeah, it's a false alarm.
Thanks.

847
01:03:16,255 --> 01:03:18,257
Charlie you scare me to death.

848
01:03:18,841 --> 01:03:20,259
That guy was out there.

849
01:03:20,467 --> 01:03:21,635
What guy?

850
01:03:22,803 --> 01:03:24,304
You've been drinking.

851
01:03:24,304 --> 01:03:25,347
Who me?

852
01:03:25,347 --> 01:03:26,598
Oh my God.,

853
01:03:26,598 --> 01:03:28,517
No, you got it wrong.

854
01:03:28,517 --> 01:03:32,187
See I'm just a victim of this
hazardous working condition.

855
01:03:32,187 --> 01:03:33,313
Sure you are.

856
01:03:33,313 --> 01:03:34,273
No, really!

857
01:03:34,273 --> 01:03:35,816
That man was watching the
house.

858
01:03:35,816 --> 01:03:37,651
No there ain't nobody.

859
01:03:41,905 --> 01:03:44,157
What is this?

860
01:03:46,034 --> 01:03:47,828
Looks like a recorder.

861
01:03:49,663 --> 01:03:51,039
Is that what on here?

862
01:03:51,331 --> 01:03:54,835
Saying he never saw what he
agree to testify to in court.

863
01:03:56,336 --> 01:03:57,171
You didn't?

864
01:03:57,504 --> 01:03:58,755
I most certainly didn't.

865
01:03:59,131 --> 01:04:00,299
You know what?

866
01:04:00,674 --> 01:04:02,509
He was no where near the
shooting.

867
01:04:03,093 --> 01:04:04,803
I mean no where near it.

868
01:04:07,639 --> 01:04:09,558
Charlie, this is fabulous.

869
01:04:11,226 --> 01:04:13,604
This proof they're setting him
up.

870
01:04:17,816 --> 01:04:18,901
Charlie, I....

871
01:04:21,695 --> 01:04:25,616
You really think I wanna give
up 483 days of sobriety?

872
01:04:27,034 --> 01:04:29,620
And start all over from day
one?

873
01:04:36,043 --> 01:04:37,794
I'll make some coffee.

874
01:04:38,253 --> 01:04:39,922
Oh, wait a minute, not so fast.

875
01:04:40,172 --> 01:04:44,259
See I figure,
you already slipped Charlie.

876
01:04:44,426 --> 01:04:46,011
Why not just one more?

877
01:04:47,346 --> 01:04:48,597
How about it Claire?
One for our side.

878
01:04:49,765 --> 01:04:51,517
I can't.
I'm trying to get pregnant.

879
01:04:52,434 --> 01:04:53,268
Oh.

880
01:04:57,064 --> 01:04:58,774
I'm not trying to get pregnant.

881
01:05:00,108 --> 01:05:03,070
I'm certainly not trying to get
pregnant.

882
01:05:23,924 --> 01:05:25,342
You're late council.

883
01:05:25,342 --> 01:05:26,677
Prosecution request to side bar.

884
01:05:28,303 --> 01:05:29,054
Make it good.

885
01:05:33,100 --> 01:05:34,768
Your honour, my next witness
Troy Abbott has disappeared.

886
01:05:34,768 --> 01:05:36,270
What?

887
01:05:36,436 --> 01:05:38,105
He's gone from his room and we
notify the MP

888
01:05:38,105 --> 01:05:39,773
Notify my ass? You let him out jail.

889
01:05:39,773 --> 01:05:42,943
We have a tape that impeached
his original statement.

890
01:05:43,110 --> 01:05:45,445
I don't know anything about
this tape.

891
01:05:45,696 --> 01:05:47,197
What do you mean you don't
know? You got spy all over.

892
01:05:47,406 --> 01:05:48,657
In my chamber everybody.

893
01:05:48,657 --> 01:05:49,908
This court is recess.

894
01:05:50,284 --> 01:05:51,368
All rise.

895
01:06:00,878 --> 01:06:03,505
You see Chatman shoot the bad
guy?

896
01:06:03,505 --> 01:06:05,174
You say, no sir, I didn't.

897
01:06:05,174 --> 01:06:08,969
He say be sure about this cause
you career is on the line.

898
01:06:10,637 --> 01:06:13,974
Everybody else say he did it
so I say what they want to hear.

899
01:06:14,391 --> 01:06:16,393
One more witness and there's no
difference.

900
01:06:16,393 --> 01:06:17,603
Right?

901
01:06:35,037 --> 01:06:37,623
We can't authenticate this
tape.

902
01:06:37,998 --> 01:06:39,833
For all we know he may had been
coerced.

903
01:06:41,793 --> 01:06:42,961
It isn't admissible.

904
01:06:43,128 --> 01:06:44,505
What?

905
01:06:44,505 --> 01:06:46,465
You admitted Abbott's CId
statement.

906
01:06:46,673 --> 01:06:48,175
We need this to rebute it.

907
01:06:48,342 --> 01:06:50,761
This tape clearly exonerate
Ron Chartman.

908
01:06:51,011 --> 01:06:53,472
The CId statement is taken by
an objective party.

909
01:06:53,847 --> 01:06:55,182
Bullshit!

910
01:06:55,182 --> 01:06:56,642
He lied!

911
01:06:56,642 --> 01:06:58,435
They lied! How the hell was
that objective?

912
01:06:58,602 --> 01:07:00,229
The tape is excluded.

913
01:07:00,354 --> 01:07:01,355
What's next?

914
01:07:01,355 --> 01:07:02,397
Your honour!

915
01:07:02,397 --> 01:07:04,691
Excluded, counselor!

916
01:07:07,569 --> 01:07:08,654
Major.

917
01:07:10,364 --> 01:07:12,824
We are out of witnesses.
Prosecution rests.

918
01:07:14,368 --> 01:07:15,494
This is a capital case.

919
01:07:15,661 --> 01:07:17,663
An objective judge would have
admitted the tape.

920
01:07:17,746 --> 01:07:19,957
We'll hear from the defense
next Friday.

921
01:07:20,958 --> 01:07:22,417
This is ground for an appeal.

922
01:07:34,388 --> 01:07:35,305
Tommy?

923
01:07:35,430 --> 01:07:36,223
Claire?

924
01:07:36,223 --> 01:07:37,224
We will appeal this.

925
01:07:37,224 --> 01:07:38,725
Stop. You can't fight them.

926
01:07:38,725 --> 01:07:41,520
don't talk that way.
We will get another break.

927
01:07:41,520 --> 01:07:43,230
You don't know this people.

928
01:07:43,647 --> 01:07:45,274
Stop it before you get yourself
hurt.

929
01:07:46,775 --> 01:07:48,110
We can win this.

930
01:07:48,443 --> 01:07:50,279
I'm not going to let them do
this to you.

931
01:08:01,748 --> 01:08:02,749
What are you doing?

932
01:08:09,673 --> 01:08:11,049
Is that a ....

933
01:08:11,049 --> 01:08:14,011
Must have done it when they
install the phones.

934
01:08:17,890 --> 01:08:19,975
And you two were so ready to
blame Terry.

935
01:08:20,684 --> 01:08:22,060
So self-righteous.

936
01:08:24,521 --> 01:08:26,690
Let's go to Federal.
demand a retrial.

937
01:08:27,065 --> 01:08:27,900
denied.

938
01:08:28,775 --> 01:08:32,654
There's no way we can proof
that they have anything to do

939
01:08:32,654 --> 01:08:33,697
with all this.

940
01:08:33,697 --> 01:08:34,865
Then what?

941
01:08:39,578 --> 01:08:41,788
We are out of witnesses and
we are out of time.

942
01:08:43,415 --> 01:08:45,584
Maybe it is time that we heard
from the Brigadier General.

943
01:08:45,709 --> 01:08:46,960
I don't understand.

944
01:08:46,960 --> 01:08:48,212
No.

945
01:08:48,545 --> 01:08:50,130
You think we should pay him a
visit?

946
01:08:50,297 --> 01:08:52,049
I think you should pay him a
visit.

947
01:08:52,382 --> 01:08:54,009
Why me?

948
01:08:54,009 --> 01:08:56,094
Are you scare of them?

949
01:08:57,638 --> 01:08:58,680
No, but....

950
01:08:58,972 --> 01:09:01,058
I'm just a torn on the marine
corps ass.

951
01:09:03,685 --> 01:09:05,187
But you my dear?

952
01:09:06,772 --> 01:09:10,150
You're the pretty,
young sympathetic little wife.

953
01:09:11,276 --> 01:09:12,694
I don't play those games.

954
01:09:16,657 --> 01:09:17,491
Shit.

955
01:09:32,339 --> 01:09:33,674
General Marks.

956
01:09:33,841 --> 01:09:34,883
No press please.

957
01:09:35,092 --> 01:09:36,593
I'm not from the press,
how do you do?

958
01:09:36,593 --> 01:09:37,135
Miss?

959
01:09:37,135 --> 01:09:38,512
Kubik, Claire Kubik.

960
01:09:38,512 --> 01:09:40,556
I'm representing my husband.

961
01:09:42,808 --> 01:09:45,477
Mrs. Kubik, good day.

962
01:09:45,686 --> 01:09:46,562
General Marks.

963
01:09:46,562 --> 01:09:48,313
You gave Hernandez an order.
-I have nothing to say to you.

964
01:09:52,359 --> 01:09:55,320
He knew detachment 27 will come
under attack.

965
01:09:56,697 --> 01:09:58,448
You're a dignify man sir.
And the cover up.

966
01:09:59,867 --> 01:10:00,993
I dare you.

967
01:10:01,118 --> 01:10:03,370
Your man Hernandez overreacted
and a open fire.

968
01:10:03,370 --> 01:10:05,706
Young lady you are way out your
line.

969
01:10:06,790 --> 01:10:09,376
Listen to this Sir and tell me
how out of the line I am.

970
01:10:27,102 --> 01:10:29,062
This is CW Grimes and
associate.

971
01:10:29,271 --> 01:10:32,024
If you want to talk to Charlie,
leave a message after the beep.

972
01:10:32,858 --> 01:10:35,652
If you want to talk to Delailah
you should get your head examined.

973
01:10:36,486 --> 01:10:39,698
Charlie that was a great idea.
He flicks me off like a flea.

974
01:10:40,240 --> 01:10:41,658
I'm going to loose my mind.

975
01:10:42,242 --> 01:10:44,578
I mean we cannot let them get
away with this.

976
01:10:44,578 --> 01:10:47,289
There has to be somebody was
there.

977
01:10:47,414 --> 01:10:49,708
There has be somebody whose?

978
01:11:01,845 --> 01:11:02,846
directory assistant.

979
01:11:03,096 --> 01:11:04,056
The Herald?

980
01:11:07,392 --> 01:11:09,269
When you settle down.
I do have something to say.

981
01:11:13,524 --> 01:11:15,526
You know that I cannot legally
comment on?

982
01:11:16,026 --> 01:11:17,903
the details of the court
marshall proceeding.

983
01:11:18,278 --> 01:11:21,365
But I would however like to say
that my husband is innocent

984
01:11:22,533 --> 01:11:25,786
There is a man who is stranger
to me who said to me last week,

985
01:11:26,745 --> 01:11:28,705
that all lawyers are a waste
of oxygen.

986
01:11:29,623 --> 01:11:32,793
As a wife and attorney,
I greatly feel that justice will

987
01:11:32,793 --> 01:11:34,253
not be served.

988
01:11:34,753 --> 01:11:39,258
And I would like to challenge
that man or whoever who know

989
01:11:39,258 --> 01:11:42,553
what happened to come forward.

990
01:11:44,930 --> 01:11:46,682
press conference with attorney
Claire Kubik.

991
01:11:46,974 --> 01:11:50,102
She is continuing insisting
that her husband is innocent.

992
01:11:50,894 --> 01:11:54,273
As an attorney and wife, she is
clearly standing by her man.

993
01:12:28,849 --> 01:12:30,684
The whole firm saw you at the
6 o' clock news.

994
01:12:30,684 --> 01:12:32,936
Hello Alex,
I have been expecting you.

995
01:12:40,694 --> 01:12:41,945
I'll...

996
01:12:44,948 --> 01:12:46,909
I'll send in my resignation
tomorrow.

997
01:13:04,635 --> 01:13:05,719
Get in.

998
01:13:07,387 --> 01:13:08,347
No.

999
01:13:14,311 --> 01:13:15,812
Wait, okay, wait.

1000
01:13:32,204 --> 01:13:33,497
Where are we going?

1001
01:13:39,878 --> 01:13:41,588
I want to know the truth.

1002
01:13:46,093 --> 01:13:48,679
I want to know what happened
at Las Calinas.

1003
01:13:59,815 --> 01:14:01,483
You don't care about the truth.

1004
01:14:02,067 --> 01:14:05,195
All you care about,
is saving your husband.

1005
01:14:44,443 --> 01:14:45,527
Get out.

1006
01:15:01,418 --> 01:15:03,921
You want to know about
Las Calinas?

1007
01:15:04,922 --> 01:15:06,882
Women like you?

1008
01:15:08,342 --> 01:15:11,345
beautiful, young?

1009
01:15:16,850 --> 01:15:20,687
And the old people? begging for their lives.

1010
01:15:35,452 --> 01:15:36,286
Jesus Christ.

1011
01:15:38,914 --> 01:15:40,499
It was 12 years ago.

1012
01:15:40,874 --> 01:15:42,626
They all looked the same in
green uniforms?

1013
01:15:42,835 --> 01:15:44,002
don't be foolish.

1014
01:15:45,879 --> 01:15:48,757
I just want to show you a
photograph.

1015
01:16:02,563 --> 01:16:03,814
I remember him.

1016
01:16:04,398 --> 01:16:06,191
The one with the patch over his
eye.

1017
01:16:07,317 --> 01:16:09,361
The blood is still fresh in
Montezo.

1018
01:16:10,529 --> 01:16:12,281
This man was in Montezo?

1019
01:16:12,573 --> 01:16:13,824
Of course he was.

1020
01:16:14,074 --> 01:16:15,701
He killed dinelo Chicon.

1021
01:16:17,244 --> 01:16:18,704
Chicon was in the Cafe.

1022
01:16:18,704 --> 01:16:20,581
In a secret meeting.

1023
01:16:20,747 --> 01:16:22,165
And this man was there.

1024
01:16:22,165 --> 01:16:23,625
He was there.

1025
01:16:26,920 --> 01:16:28,505
That is how he hurt his eye.

1026
01:16:29,089 --> 01:16:32,551
Chicon blew off the cafe and
killed the 3 American students.

1027
01:16:32,551 --> 01:16:34,344
You people believe anything.

1028
01:16:34,803 --> 01:16:36,221
The students were killed by
mistake.

1029
01:16:36,722 --> 01:16:38,724
Because the American military
didn't know they were there.

1030
01:16:40,976 --> 01:16:43,353
To cover it up,
they blamed the rebels and were

1031
01:16:43,353 --> 01:16:45,230
looking for their leader in
Las Calinas.

1032
01:16:46,607 --> 01:16:48,150
But they knew he was already
dead.

1033
01:16:49,276 --> 01:16:51,028
They knew they had killed him
with the bomb.

1034
01:17:13,884 --> 01:17:14,343
Thanks a lot.

1035
01:17:14,343 --> 01:17:15,511
You're welcome.

1036
01:17:40,494 --> 01:17:42,829
If it isn't the little miss
6 o'clock news.

1037
01:17:43,664 --> 01:17:44,998
You're drunk.

1038
01:17:45,332 --> 01:17:46,792
You're suppose to call me...

1039
01:17:48,210 --> 01:17:49,169
And you got....

1040
01:17:49,169 --> 01:17:51,171
Charlie, I called you.

1041
01:17:54,007 --> 01:17:56,093
I was out.
But you could have called back.

1042
01:17:56,218 --> 01:17:58,303
I thought we had an agreement.

1043
01:17:58,971 --> 01:18:00,097
Excuse me.

1044
01:18:00,264 --> 01:18:01,974
I thought we had an agreement.

1045
01:18:03,141 --> 01:18:06,103
I thought me and you were fine.

1046
01:18:06,520 --> 01:18:08,021
But you know, partner don't...

1047
01:18:08,188 --> 01:18:09,731
Charlie, it worked.

1048
01:18:11,859 --> 01:18:12,860
Charlie,

1049
01:18:12,860 --> 01:18:13,986
What?

1050
01:18:13,986 --> 01:18:15,654
I just spent an hour with the
guy.

1051
01:18:17,531 --> 01:18:19,741
He's the real deal.
He saw the whole thing.

1052
01:18:20,284 --> 01:18:22,077
Tom is innocent.

1053
01:18:22,202 --> 01:18:25,539
This proof that there's a cover
up and it is bigger than we

1054
01:18:25,539 --> 01:18:26,540
thought.

1055
01:18:26,999 --> 01:18:28,792
I need you sober!

1056
01:18:32,421 --> 01:18:33,380
Come on.

1057
01:18:33,380 --> 01:18:34,047
Yeah, alright.

1058
01:18:34,047 --> 01:18:35,424
Let's get you home.

1059
01:18:35,424 --> 01:18:36,383
Okay, baby.

1060
01:18:36,383 --> 01:18:38,010
No, Charlie.

1061
01:18:40,345 --> 01:18:42,222
Chris last one.
Just one more.

1062
01:18:42,472 --> 01:18:43,557
Forget about it.

1063
01:18:43,765 --> 01:18:44,725
I got it.

1064
01:18:49,897 --> 01:18:50,856
Come on partner.

1065
01:18:57,696 --> 01:18:58,739
Alright partner.

1066
01:19:29,102 --> 01:19:30,354
What the hell was that?

1067
01:19:34,733 --> 01:19:35,734
Oh, my God!

1068
01:19:40,072 --> 01:19:41,281
Shit, it's oil!

1069
01:20:30,706 --> 01:20:32,541
Hey, sweetie.

1070
01:20:39,464 --> 01:20:40,966
I had the worst dream.

1071
01:20:42,092 --> 01:20:45,137
I dream I was pregnant and
these people came took the baby

1072
01:20:45,137 --> 01:20:46,054
away.

1073
01:20:46,805 --> 01:20:48,307
You one lucky girl.

1074
01:20:49,766 --> 01:20:51,143
You and the gentleman.

1075
01:20:53,937 --> 01:20:55,314
I want you to take something.

1076
01:21:07,367 --> 01:21:08,827
don't you worry about a thing.

1077
01:21:10,204 --> 01:21:11,663
You'll have another baby.

1078
01:21:15,501 --> 01:21:16,668
What?

1079
01:21:18,378 --> 01:21:20,172
don't you worry.
-What?

1080
01:21:20,422 --> 01:21:22,049
You'll have another one.

1081
01:21:25,302 --> 01:21:27,804
Jackie?

1082
01:21:29,264 --> 01:21:30,224
No.

1083
01:21:45,531 --> 01:21:47,491
Be strong, be strong.

1084
01:22:04,508 --> 01:22:05,676
Claire, is Charlie.

1085
01:22:05,884 --> 01:22:06,802
Come in.

1086
01:22:11,390 --> 01:22:12,516
Hi.

1087
01:22:20,524 --> 01:22:21,608
How's your neck?

1088
01:22:21,733 --> 01:22:23,026
Oh, it's alright.

1089
01:22:23,360 --> 01:22:26,071
I had it worse the last time
looking at pretty women like you

1090
01:22:26,071 --> 01:22:27,197
on the street.

1091
01:22:31,034 --> 01:22:32,411
I'm truly sorry, Claire.

1092
01:22:37,583 --> 01:22:39,918
I wanted that baby so much,
Charlie.

1093
01:22:43,714 --> 01:22:45,090
You know I kept thinking.

1094
01:22:47,593 --> 01:22:50,387
Maybe there is something wrong
with me or I didn't deserve it.

1095
01:22:52,431 --> 01:22:54,016
I wouldn't be a good mother.

1096
01:22:55,267 --> 01:22:57,769
I really didn't think they'll
do something like this.

1097
01:22:59,938 --> 01:23:01,315
I'm at zero, Charlie.

1098
01:23:01,690 --> 01:23:03,901
Hold now. Listen to me.

1099
01:23:04,776 --> 01:23:06,445
I know about zero.

1100
01:23:07,529 --> 01:23:08,947
I've hit bottom.

1101
01:23:09,948 --> 01:23:12,409
And I was on my way back
before that accident.

1102
01:23:13,493 --> 01:23:14,953
But you know what?

1103
01:23:15,704 --> 01:23:17,748
I think we were spared for some
reason.

1104
01:23:18,165 --> 01:23:19,583
And you got to believe that.

1105
01:23:20,792 --> 01:23:24,505
So, if we are gonna make it
over this is day one.

1106
01:23:26,298 --> 01:23:27,007
Okay?

1107
01:23:31,428 --> 01:23:32,471
You got another visitor.

1108
01:23:43,232 --> 01:23:44,608
Merry Christmas.

1109
01:23:46,026 --> 01:23:46,985
You alright?

1110
01:23:48,487 --> 01:23:50,072
I owe you an apology
Lieutenant.

1111
01:23:52,282 --> 01:23:53,659
We were mistaken.

1112
01:23:54,326 --> 01:23:55,244
That's ok.

1113
01:23:55,619 --> 01:23:58,121
Although I'm not sure 'merry'
is the right word to use around

1114
01:23:58,121 --> 01:23:58,747
here.

1115
01:23:59,498 --> 01:24:02,292
Well, that's why you might be
wrong, Mrs. Kubik.

1116
01:24:05,003 --> 01:24:08,340
If it's true Hernandez injured
his eye in the bombing,

1117
01:24:09,341 --> 01:24:11,009
he would've got an immediate
treatment for it.

1118
01:24:11,426 --> 01:24:13,929
And they just keep records
about those operations so we can

1119
01:24:13,929 --> 01:24:15,389
go and look them up?

1120
01:24:15,389 --> 01:24:17,933
No, he would've insisted on it
for insurance purposes.

1121
01:24:18,475 --> 01:24:20,561
So the government can ensure
the amount of compensation.

1122
01:24:36,535 --> 01:24:37,578
Agent Mullins!

1123
01:24:41,206 --> 01:24:42,583
I just need a minute of your
time.

1124
01:24:46,170 --> 01:24:50,507
Some how I'm sure it's not my
good looks for which I owe the

1125
01:24:50,507 --> 01:24:51,800
honour of this visit.

1126
01:24:52,009 --> 01:24:54,052
The press accepted the official
version of the story.

1127
01:24:54,636 --> 01:24:56,722
But what if Chicon didn't blow
up the cafe?

1128
01:24:56,889 --> 01:25:02,019
What if Hernandez blew up the
Cafe and killed the American

1129
01:25:02,186 --> 01:25:03,395
students by mistake?

1130
01:25:04,188 --> 01:25:07,191
What if General Marks wanted to
cover the whole thing up,

1131
01:25:07,191 --> 01:25:08,942
staged a raid in Las Calinas?

1132
01:25:09,359 --> 01:25:11,945
First of all this is not my
job. And is none of my business.

1133
01:25:12,196 --> 01:25:13,947
I'm just asking you just to
look in to it.

1134
01:25:14,573 --> 01:25:15,824
Big and lean one, chief.

1135
01:25:16,116 --> 01:25:18,535
Why not?
I know you have resources.

1136
01:25:18,702 --> 01:25:20,162
Resources?

1137
01:25:20,329 --> 01:25:22,164
You keep saying it is not your
job.

1138
01:25:22,497 --> 01:25:24,291
Good, I wasn't sure you were
listening.

1139
01:25:24,625 --> 01:25:26,835
Well, agent Mullins whose job
is it?

1140
01:25:34,301 --> 01:25:36,178
Come on! Whose job?

1141
01:25:37,304 --> 01:25:40,057
What a pain in the ass you are.

1142
01:25:41,850 --> 01:25:43,810
Hernandez was injured in the
explosion.

1143
01:25:44,603 --> 01:25:47,606
There has got to be a
classified medical record.

1144
01:26:04,373 --> 01:26:05,874
Hey, Charlie, it's me.

1145
01:26:06,667 --> 01:26:07,751
How are you, Mac?

1146
01:26:07,876 --> 01:26:10,295
I've been checking out rumours
of how those witnesses really

1147
01:26:10,295 --> 01:26:11,380
die.

1148
01:26:11,380 --> 01:26:13,298
I've been all over the place.
I've got expenses.

1149
01:26:14,800 --> 01:26:16,051
This is going to cost you.

1150
01:26:16,635 --> 01:26:17,636
You told me that.

1151
01:26:17,636 --> 01:26:19,805
I found the wife of the one who
is murdered.

1152
01:26:19,972 --> 01:26:21,598
She is living in Mexico.

1153
01:26:22,516 --> 01:26:24,768
And she swears,
military killed her husband.

1154
01:26:27,646 --> 01:26:28,480
Just inside.

1155
01:27:12,858 --> 01:27:14,109
Have you heard from Charlie?

1156
01:27:14,109 --> 01:27:15,485
He called about an hour ago.

1157
01:27:15,569 --> 01:27:17,779
But we was like really weird,
he can't speak on the phone.

1158
01:27:18,238 --> 01:27:20,699
Well, like Charlie, I don't
want to talk on the phone.

1159
01:27:21,700 --> 01:27:22,826
He did say he was in Mexico.

1160
01:27:23,035 --> 01:27:24,077
In Mexico?

1161
01:27:24,453 --> 01:27:25,787
What is he doing in Mexico?

1162
01:27:27,539 --> 01:27:28,790
Yeah, but I want to stop on
Los Angeles first.

1163
01:27:28,790 --> 01:27:29,583
Alright.

1164
01:27:29,583 --> 01:27:30,542
So I'll see you.

1165
01:27:46,058 --> 01:27:46,934
General.

1166
01:27:48,352 --> 01:27:50,062
You all have had him all night
and it's my turn.

1167
01:27:51,563 --> 01:27:52,648
Shall we?

1168
01:27:57,653 --> 01:28:00,197
We uncovered the real reason
you send detachment 27 to

1169
01:28:00,197 --> 01:28:01,156
Las Calinas.

1170
01:28:02,199 --> 01:28:04,451
Uncovered? It's a matter of
public record.

1171
01:28:04,451 --> 01:28:05,702
Well, not really.

1172
01:28:05,953 --> 01:28:09,540
What is a matter of record is
Hernandez sustained his eye

1173
01:28:09,540 --> 01:28:10,874
injury in a bombing at Montezo.

1174
01:28:11,542 --> 01:28:14,086
Eyewitnesses placed him in the
truck which the bomb was thrown.

1175
01:28:15,045 --> 01:28:17,965
And he had that injury treated
at the hospital in San Salvador.

1176
01:28:20,384 --> 01:28:23,136
The gung-ho raid,
was decoy for your bombing.

1177
01:28:26,223 --> 01:28:29,601
This fairy tale of yours would
have to be based on classified

1178
01:28:29,601 --> 01:28:30,477
material.

1179
01:28:30,477 --> 01:28:34,898
Even any of it is possible.
And you're bluffing.

1180
01:28:35,399 --> 01:28:36,984
And you're doing it badly.

1181
01:28:50,789 --> 01:28:53,917
We be only too happy to have
you testify on the court to

1182
01:28:53,917 --> 01:28:55,711
fully explore our evidence.

1183
01:28:58,255 --> 01:29:01,592
For example classified document
dated 3.1 4.88.

1184
01:29:02,092 --> 01:29:05,220
Hernandez's medical report,
for shrapnel wound,

1185
01:29:05,304 --> 01:29:06,889
Santa Maria hospital.

1186
01:29:07,139 --> 01:29:09,725
That is the same day and mighty
close to Montezo.

1187
01:29:18,275 --> 01:29:19,568
You have no shame.

1188
01:29:19,985 --> 01:29:22,905
Look at what you are willing to
do, to free a murderer.

1189
01:29:23,363 --> 01:29:26,325
Call the right people, I want
the charges drop and documents...

1190
01:29:26,617 --> 01:29:30,495
Have you notice that,
you've been unlucky lately?

1191
01:29:33,415 --> 01:29:35,918
Caution might be the order of
the day for you.

1192
01:29:36,460 --> 01:29:38,045
I'm not afraid of you.

1193
01:29:39,338 --> 01:29:42,174
I've already survived you once,
you smug son of a bitch.

1194
01:29:42,341 --> 01:29:44,301
The real question is will you
survive me?

1195
01:29:46,512 --> 01:29:49,973
Make it got away,
or the document goes public.

1196
01:29:57,189 --> 01:29:58,899
For both our sakes, sir.

1197
01:30:22,506 --> 01:30:23,841
Pull over, right here.

1198
01:30:28,804 --> 01:30:29,596
Jackie?

1199
01:30:30,347 --> 01:30:31,265
Jackie!

1200
01:30:40,983 --> 01:30:41,525
Madam.

1201
01:30:42,192 --> 01:30:44,486
Claire! You alright?

1202
01:30:45,612 --> 01:30:46,822
Yeah.

1203
01:30:49,908 --> 01:30:51,410
What the hell is that all
about?

1204
01:30:51,535 --> 01:30:54,079
Colonel Farrell wants us to be
in court tomorrow at 0800.

1205
01:30:55,539 --> 01:31:00,627
Waldron was disqualified from
the case for talking to the

1206
01:31:00,627 --> 01:31:01,170
press.

1207
01:31:02,546 --> 01:31:04,131
Any word from Charlie?

1208
01:31:04,590 --> 01:31:08,051
I'm trying on his cell all day,
but just getting the voice mail.

1209
01:31:12,806 --> 01:31:14,516
We still have Hernandez's
medical report.

1210
01:31:16,935 --> 01:31:19,646
I'll do my best.

1211
01:31:20,939 --> 01:31:23,275
Farrell wouldn't admit
classified document anymore than

1212
01:31:23,525 --> 01:31:24,902
he would has with the tape.

1213
01:31:27,237 --> 01:31:28,447
Maybe we should take the deal.

1214
01:31:29,281 --> 01:31:30,407
There is no more deal.

1215
01:31:39,875 --> 01:31:40,709
I'm sorry.

1216
01:31:42,461 --> 01:31:44,129
Why don't you spend the night
out.

1217
01:31:45,005 --> 01:31:47,466
I don't know if it is a good
idea to be around here tonight.

1218
01:31:49,843 --> 01:31:51,595
I ....

1219
01:31:54,556 --> 01:31:56,517
need a little time on my own.

1220
01:32:29,216 --> 01:32:30,342
You looking for Charlie?

1221
01:32:30,342 --> 01:32:31,260
No.

1222
01:32:40,644 --> 01:32:42,145
What's going on, Honey?

1223
01:32:42,437 --> 01:32:43,313
I don't know.

1224
01:32:46,149 --> 01:32:47,192
All arise.

1225
01:32:58,871 --> 01:32:59,413
Be sitted.

1226
01:33:03,834 --> 01:33:06,128
Major Waldron, Mrs. Kubik please approach.

1227
01:33:20,726 --> 01:33:22,227
What the hell is this?

1228
01:33:22,436 --> 01:33:24,146
For reason of national
security.

1229
01:33:25,105 --> 01:33:29,484
The department of defense
determine to withdraw the charges

1230
01:33:29,484 --> 01:33:33,322
against Chatman.

1231
01:33:33,697 --> 01:33:34,656
Court is close!

1232
01:33:35,199 --> 01:33:37,492
Sergeant Chatman,
you're free to go.

1233
01:33:38,535 --> 01:33:39,536
Oh, my God.

1234
01:33:58,388 --> 01:34:00,390
Let's get out of here.

1235
01:34:10,651 --> 01:34:14,905
Hey, Charlie, listen in case
you are interested pal, we won.

1236
01:34:17,783 --> 01:34:19,701
We are going to the Marane,
a while from this town.

1237
01:34:20,619 --> 01:34:22,538
If you ever want to call me,
there is where we'll be.

1238
01:34:23,580 --> 01:34:24,706
Hope you're ok.

1239
01:34:28,961 --> 01:34:30,170
Jesus, look at this.

1240
01:34:35,467 --> 01:34:37,010
What do you suggest I do?

1241
01:34:37,803 --> 01:34:39,930
Have Jackie met us on the next
block with our car.

1242
01:34:40,138 --> 01:34:41,849
Will there be more of them at
the airport?

1243
01:34:41,849 --> 01:34:43,016
Probably.

1244
01:34:43,267 --> 01:34:44,601
Why do we need to bother?

1245
01:34:44,685 --> 01:34:45,936
Let's just drive.

1246
01:35:07,666 --> 01:35:08,959
That's everything.

1247
01:35:09,418 --> 01:35:10,752
You take care of yourself.

1248
01:35:10,752 --> 01:35:12,379
You too.

1249
01:35:13,422 --> 01:35:14,047
Thanks Jack.

1250
01:35:14,047 --> 01:35:15,090
Well, kid?

1251
01:35:15,090 --> 01:35:16,300
Well?
-Old man.

1252
01:35:16,300 --> 01:35:18,343
We're okay.
-Take care.

1253
01:35:20,387 --> 01:35:21,638
Thank you so much.

1254
01:35:21,763 --> 01:35:22,973
Thank you Lieutenant.

1255
01:35:23,265 --> 01:35:24,641
We are gonna to take our time.

1256
01:35:25,684 --> 01:35:27,436
So we'll call you when we get
there.

1257
01:35:27,436 --> 01:35:28,770
Probably around 7.

1258
01:35:29,646 --> 01:35:31,273
Good bye.
-Good bye.

1259
01:35:45,329 --> 01:35:48,916
A week before he was murdered,
he started calling an old marine

1260
01:35:48,916 --> 01:35:50,292
corps buddy.

1261
01:35:51,502 --> 01:35:54,755
Who incidentally was killed
about two months after Paul's.

1262
01:35:55,547 --> 01:35:57,799
I don't know what they talk
about but it really upset him.

1263
01:36:01,386 --> 01:36:04,473
You have no idea what it is
like to see somebody you love

1264
01:36:04,473 --> 01:36:05,849
killed right in front of you.

1265
01:36:07,059 --> 01:36:09,686
And you believe that this is
connected to the military?

1266
01:36:09,686 --> 01:36:10,562
Yeah.

1267
01:36:12,523 --> 01:36:15,484
It's just a feeling,
cause all women?

1268
01:36:16,068 --> 01:36:17,069
you know..

1269
01:36:17,361 --> 01:36:21,698
He just seem to recognize them,
the thing he did with hands.

1270
01:36:23,283 --> 01:36:24,868
Paul seems to know who he was.

1271
01:36:30,624 --> 01:36:32,543
You think that they are still
around here?

1272
01:36:36,004 --> 01:36:38,382
You know one thing that bother
me more than everything?

1273
01:36:39,591 --> 01:36:41,260
I couldn't protect you.

1274
01:36:42,052 --> 01:36:44,054
I just stand by and let them
hurt you.

1275
01:36:48,892 --> 01:36:50,769
We need some more champagne.

1276
01:36:54,982 --> 01:36:56,108
I love you.

1277
01:36:58,735 --> 01:37:00,445
I love you.

1278
01:37:03,991 --> 01:37:06,785
I thought, you unplugged that.

1279
01:37:07,160 --> 01:37:09,454
I did but I tried Charlie one
more time.

1280
01:37:09,955 --> 01:37:12,541
Hi, Claire, it's me.

1281
01:37:14,001 --> 01:37:15,419
Sweetheart I'm sorry.

1282
01:37:15,669 --> 01:37:19,298
I'll be right back.
-I'm sorry I wasn't there today.

1283
01:37:20,757 --> 01:37:23,635
I let you down.

1284
01:37:24,261 --> 01:37:25,762
Yeah, Charlie.
-Hi.

1285
01:37:26,722 --> 01:37:31,685
I'm real sorry.
I just, I couldn't get there.

1286
01:37:31,852 --> 01:37:33,395
Why is it Charlie? Of all days.

1287
01:37:33,604 --> 01:37:36,607
What if Marks opt to testify or
what?

1288
01:37:38,317 --> 01:37:41,862
You know what,
I don't want to talk about it.

1289
01:37:42,112 --> 01:37:43,572
I thought I had a friend.

1290
01:37:44,281 --> 01:37:47,201
I am your friend.

1291
01:37:47,784 --> 01:37:48,952
Sure you are.

1292
01:37:50,704 --> 01:37:53,874
Just say a toast for my husband
while you drink yourself silly.

1293
01:37:54,124 --> 01:37:55,375
Good bye Charlie.
-Listen.

1294
01:37:56,001 --> 01:37:57,836
I am your friend.

1295
01:37:58,003 --> 01:38:01,298
I was being your friend today,
more that you care to know.

1296
01:38:02,049 --> 01:38:03,091
What do you mean?

1297
01:38:04,510 --> 01:38:05,511
We need to talk.

1298
01:38:05,844 --> 01:38:08,347
I just do not think that now is
the good time for it.

1299
01:38:09,932 --> 01:38:11,016
Where are you going?

1300
01:38:11,517 --> 01:38:14,520
I think this AA's meeting
should be anonymous.

1301
01:38:16,396 --> 01:38:18,023
I'm going to get some more
champagne.

1302
01:38:18,273 --> 01:38:19,024
Okay, hurry back.

1303
01:38:24,154 --> 01:38:26,240
Are Marks and Hernandez
going to give us trouble?

1304
01:38:28,200 --> 01:38:29,576
Is Tom still there?

1305
01:38:29,701 --> 01:38:31,119
No, he's going to the stall.

1306
01:38:31,286 --> 01:38:33,455
Alright, get your computer,
hold up your calendar.

1307
01:38:35,415 --> 01:38:39,169
Find out where your husband
was on 20 Jan 1997.

1308
01:38:40,838 --> 01:38:42,089
Why are you doing this Charlie?

1309
01:38:42,172 --> 01:38:43,799
Look it up, it's important.

1310
01:38:51,265 --> 01:38:54,184
Tom is in Santa Fe.
He met a collector.

1311
01:38:54,601 --> 01:38:56,019
I pick him up from the airport.

1312
01:38:56,144 --> 01:38:58,105
10 Feb 1997?

1313
01:39:05,779 --> 01:39:06,822
Houston, Texas.

1314
01:39:08,532 --> 01:39:10,033
Claire listen to me.

1315
01:39:10,367 --> 01:39:12,452
Those are the dates that
witnesses were murdered.

1316
01:39:13,620 --> 01:39:17,749
Stampson was murdered on
January 20th 1997 at Santa Fe.

1317
01:39:18,292 --> 01:39:21,336
Alan died in Houston Texas,
February 10th.

1318
01:39:22,588 --> 01:39:26,341
didn't Hernandez said that Tom
tossed his gun back and forth,

1319
01:39:26,675 --> 01:39:27,759
taunting his victim?

1320
01:39:30,220 --> 01:39:30,888
Yeah.

1321
01:39:31,430 --> 01:39:35,434
Stampson's wife say the man
shot her husband, then toss the

1322
01:39:35,434 --> 01:39:38,645
gun back and forth showing off,
before shooting him again.

1323
01:39:43,609 --> 01:39:45,986
I can't talk about this right
now.

1324
01:39:46,153 --> 01:39:46,904
Sure.

1325
01:39:47,321 --> 01:39:48,780
I'm sorry.

1326
01:39:49,573 --> 01:39:52,409
I just thought to let you know.

1327
01:39:52,618 --> 01:39:55,078
Alright, gotta go.

1328
01:40:13,263 --> 01:40:14,932
I thought you went to the
store.

1329
01:40:20,938 --> 01:40:22,731
I grabbed the wrong keys.

1330
01:40:23,857 --> 01:40:25,901
Those are the right keys.

1331
01:40:26,360 --> 01:40:27,903
Those are Jack's keys.

1332
01:40:31,198 --> 01:40:34,326
What were you working on there?
-Nothing.

1333
01:40:37,204 --> 01:40:39,164
You want to ran out with me to
get some champagne?

1334
01:40:39,456 --> 01:40:41,458
I'm not really in the mood for
champagne.

1335
01:40:42,376 --> 01:40:43,669
Tom!
-I'm sorry.

1336
01:40:45,504 --> 01:40:47,256
We'll just talk then.

1337
01:40:49,508 --> 01:40:50,676
Talk about what?

1338
01:40:53,136 --> 01:40:55,264
About what you are talking
about on the phone.

1339
01:40:57,558 --> 01:40:59,268
You think I'm stupid?

1340
01:41:02,980 --> 01:41:05,399
Why didn't you come to me and
talk about it?

1341
01:41:05,774 --> 01:41:07,401
You must like to keep your
secret...

1342
01:41:07,484 --> 01:41:10,070
Your life is one big secret.

1343
01:41:16,285 --> 01:41:17,870
did you do it Tom?

1344
01:41:19,037 --> 01:41:20,372
You can tell me.

1345
01:41:22,291 --> 01:41:24,001
I certainly have the right to
know.

1346
01:41:25,085 --> 01:41:26,837
I risked my life for it.

1347
01:41:27,421 --> 01:41:28,505
Lost a baby.

1348
01:41:32,134 --> 01:41:36,305
did you kill those people?

1349
01:41:40,642 --> 01:41:44,730
Yes, I did.

1350
01:41:46,565 --> 01:41:49,067
I have to. That was what I was
trained to do.

1351
01:41:51,695 --> 01:41:52,738
They lied to me.

1352
01:41:53,739 --> 01:41:55,407
They told me they were
terrorists.

1353
01:41:55,949 --> 01:41:57,159
Want me to interrogate them.

1354
01:41:57,826 --> 01:41:59,828
So, I do?

1355
01:42:00,579 --> 01:42:07,503
what you have to do to get
information out of them and...

1356
01:42:07,669 --> 01:42:08,670
So I did.

1357
01:42:10,005 --> 01:42:12,508
It was the best I can do.
And he knew it.

1358
01:42:15,052 --> 01:42:16,386
What about Stampson and Alan?

1359
01:42:16,637 --> 01:42:18,096
What about Stampson and Alan?

1360
01:42:20,682 --> 01:42:22,643
Stampson saw me on the street
one day,

1361
01:42:24,228 --> 01:42:27,147
he told Alan and they have to
go away.

1362
01:42:29,024 --> 01:42:30,400
do not look at me like that.

1363
01:42:33,028 --> 01:42:33,987
I do nothing.

1364
01:42:34,279 --> 01:42:35,531
I do not deserve it.

1365
01:42:44,706 --> 01:42:45,415
Sorry.

1366
01:42:50,254 --> 01:42:52,005
Just protecting ourselves.

1367
01:42:52,756 --> 01:42:54,216
We will get over this.

1368
01:42:54,800 --> 01:42:55,551
You'll see.

1369
01:42:56,677 --> 01:42:57,261
Honey.

1370
01:43:11,108 --> 01:43:13,527
No!

1371
01:43:31,420 --> 01:43:32,671
Stop it!

1372
01:43:33,213 --> 01:43:36,884
Tom you're hurting me.

1373
01:43:42,431 --> 01:43:43,432
Stop it.

1374
01:43:43,640 --> 01:43:45,392
Tom. Stop it!

1375
01:43:47,311 --> 01:43:49,062
Look at me.

1376
01:43:51,356 --> 01:43:52,774
Shut up, shut up.

1377
01:43:53,859 --> 01:43:55,819
don't ever lie to me.

1378
01:44:06,371 --> 01:44:08,373
I didn't want to have do this
to you.

1379
01:44:09,750 --> 01:44:11,752
You don't want to?

1380
01:44:12,461 --> 01:46:05,490
don't.

1381
01:46:05,490 --> 01:46:08,410
It's okay.

1382
01:48:06,653 --> 01:48:08,739
You have a whole sweet of
office here Charlie.

1383
01:48:10,157 --> 01:48:13,410
But, not talk about it cause I
might get spooked.

1384
01:48:13,869 --> 01:48:15,871
I mean who know what might
happened.

1385
01:48:18,207 --> 01:48:19,791
How are you holding up?

1386
01:48:21,752 --> 01:48:22,669
Okay.

1387
01:48:25,130 --> 01:48:26,673
Same old associate?

1388
01:48:26,924 --> 01:48:27,716
Oh, yeah.

1389
01:48:28,467 --> 01:48:30,427
Put your bag down at the back
somewhere.

1390
01:48:31,303 --> 01:48:34,765
She hasn't come back from
lunch. She's probably busy.

1391
01:48:36,225 --> 01:48:37,601
Come and see me.

1392
01:48:43,273 --> 01:48:46,068
You know I often ask myself why
I never left.

1393
01:48:47,277 --> 01:48:50,447
It didn't occur to me that I
never left because I didn't have

1394
01:48:50,447 --> 01:48:51,990
any place to go.

1395
01:48:55,786 --> 01:48:59,748
You know,
it could be Grimes and Kubik.

1396
01:49:13,637 --> 01:49:15,264
It gotta say Gromaldi.

1397
01:49:17,766 --> 01:49:18,976
My maiden name.

1398
01:49:19,226 --> 01:49:20,769
And Charlie.

1399
01:49:21,103 --> 01:49:22,938
You got do something about
this colour.

1400
01:49:23,230 --> 01:49:24,106
What?

1401
01:49:24,273 --> 01:49:27,192
I'm very sensitive about my
working environment.

1402
01:49:27,860 --> 01:49:29,069
Really?

1403
01:49:29,278 --> 01:49:29,987
Yeah.

1404
01:49:30,153 --> 01:49:31,154
So?

1405
01:49:31,154 --> 01:49:33,156
So I'm thinking about a
tropical colours,

1406
01:49:33,156 --> 01:49:34,992
just like look really pretty
with a little contrast....

1407
01:49:35,951 --> 01:49:38,954
Charlie check out the exterior.
I mean..
