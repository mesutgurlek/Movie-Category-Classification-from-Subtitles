1
00:02:04,998 --> 00:02:06,863
Are you Japanese?

2
00:02:08,506 --> 00:02:11,337
Want me to introduce you
to some good-lookin' babes?

3
00:02:15,459 --> 00:02:17,840
Asshole doesn't even speak English.

4
00:03:01,170 --> 00:03:03,035
Is this all right, sir?

5
00:03:10,892 --> 00:03:12,757
Thank you, sir.

6
00:03:54,511 --> 00:03:56,376
Are you going out, sir?

7
00:03:57,632 --> 00:04:00,463
Please don't bother, sir.
You already gave me a tip.

8
00:04:18,460 --> 00:04:21,346
Please see the gentleman
to this address.

9
00:04:21,421 --> 00:04:22,770
You got it.

10
00:04:39,158 --> 00:04:42,724
He worked here a while ago.
Heard he got himself into some trouble.

11
00:04:42,796 --> 00:04:44,661
So I fiired him.

12
00:04:48,430 --> 00:04:50,295
He says he quit.

13
00:04:55,994 --> 00:04:57,497
Excuse me.

14
00:04:58,795 --> 00:05:01,395
Yamamoto lives near here.

15
00:05:01,466 --> 00:05:04,418
Go three blocks that way
and then turn left.

16
00:05:04,493 --> 00:05:06,896
He lives above the Trade Building.

17
00:05:06,971 --> 00:05:11,821
He's into some bad business
with some black guys.

18
00:05:11,896 --> 00:05:13,278
Better be careful.

19
00:06:06,685 --> 00:06:10,965
Damn. Where the fuck are your eyes,
motherfucker? Huh?

20
00:06:11,031 --> 00:06:13,313
What you gonna do about my wine,
motherfucker?

21
00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:16,628
Ain't some old cheap-ass wine either.
It's gonna cost you at least $200.

22
00:06:23,456 --> 00:06:24,355
Shit.

23
00:07:24,683 --> 00:07:26,065
Hey.

24
00:07:29,705 --> 00:07:31,087
Hey.

25
00:07:48,793 --> 00:07:51,229
Hello. Good day, sir.

26
00:07:54,266 --> 00:07:56,899
The big boss wants to go out?

27
00:07:56,970 --> 00:07:58,890
Yes. Please wait a moment.

28
00:08:01,026 --> 00:08:03,857
Hey, move your short legs.

29
00:08:09,878 --> 00:08:11,260
Excuse me.

30
00:08:20,373 --> 00:08:22,721
We're in the middle of a war now.

31
00:08:28,066 --> 00:08:29,448
Got it.

32
00:08:59,194 --> 00:09:00,609
Hey, go upstairs.

33
00:09:00,675 --> 00:09:02,057
Yes, sir!

34
00:09:03,862 --> 00:09:05,727
Keep it open, asshole.

35
00:09:15,129 --> 00:09:16,511
Get out.

36
00:09:21,309 --> 00:09:22,691
Please.

37
00:09:33,284 --> 00:09:35,149
Any new girls?

38
00:09:36,181 --> 00:09:38,946
The same old faces.

39
00:09:39,014 --> 00:09:40,879
A pack of cigarettes.

40
00:09:43,328 --> 00:09:44,710
What about her?

41
00:09:45,903 --> 00:09:48,668
Come on.
She's Mr. Yoshida's girl.

42
00:09:48,735 --> 00:09:50,568
Right.

43
00:09:50,635 --> 00:09:53,235
I haven't seen him for some time.

44
00:10:00,968 --> 00:10:03,316
What about him?

45
00:10:03,382 --> 00:10:04,797
Oh, Jun.

46
00:10:04,863 --> 00:10:07,596
He was introduced
by a liquor vendor.

47
00:10:07,664 --> 00:10:09,199
- Shall I?
- No, no.

48
00:10:17,868 --> 00:10:20,666
It's great to get out of the house.

49
00:10:20,733 --> 00:10:23,564
Lots of great women here.

50
00:10:25,819 --> 00:10:29,254
No fun at home
staring at the old bag.

51
00:10:29,328 --> 00:10:31,193
Come on, drink up.

52
00:11:24,245 --> 00:11:26,110
Take the boss home.

53
00:11:27,657 --> 00:11:29,039
Big Boss, please.

54
00:11:29,106 --> 00:11:31,641
What? We're leaving already?

55
00:11:31,713 --> 00:11:33,732
- Let him pass.
- Spoilsports.

56
00:11:52,251 --> 00:11:53,721
Too weak, sir?

57
00:11:53,796 --> 00:11:55,178
Too strong.

58
00:12:01,619 --> 00:12:03,122
Brother...

59
00:12:04,258 --> 00:12:07,089
shouldn't we call a truce
with the enemy?

60
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:11,815
You're getting soft.

61
00:12:11,887 --> 00:12:13,807
Can't be so headstrong.

62
00:12:13,883 --> 00:12:15,748
We're not young anymore.

63
00:12:22,381 --> 00:12:24,246
Cops are already here.

64
00:12:33,165 --> 00:12:35,513
Dump it somewhere.

65
00:12:39,829 --> 00:12:41,749
Hope the boss went home.

66
00:12:41,825 --> 00:12:44,173
And not to his mistress's.

67
00:13:31,913 --> 00:13:34,162
Why the fuck are you here?

68
00:13:52,804 --> 00:13:54,823
That's how it is...

69
00:13:54,897 --> 00:13:58,046
So might as well
come to an agreement.

70
00:13:59,082 --> 00:14:01,913
We don't want it to get out of hand.

71
00:14:06,228 --> 00:14:08,576
Better to disband the family.

72
00:14:11,444 --> 00:14:14,758
He says he'll look after you.

73
00:14:18,267 --> 00:14:20,769
Goddamn it, this is a wake.

74
00:14:23,257 --> 00:14:25,638
Shit happens.

75
00:14:27,603 --> 00:14:29,138
"Shit happens"?

76
00:14:30,178 --> 00:14:31,747
What's with this tie?

77
00:14:31,820 --> 00:14:34,969
Back off, punk.

78
00:14:44,439 --> 00:14:47,270
"I have a wife and children...

79
00:14:47,336 --> 00:14:49,201
and my men.

80
00:14:50,555 --> 00:14:52,958
I cut off my fiinger.

81
00:14:53,033 --> 00:14:56,401
So let me join the family
that killed our boss.

82
00:14:56,478 --> 00:14:57,860
Please, brother?"

83
00:14:58,957 --> 00:15:01,788
Don't "brother" me!
I don't want this!

84
00:15:06,167 --> 00:15:08,087
I should kill you!

85
00:15:08,163 --> 00:15:10,028
You traitor!

86
00:15:10,095 --> 00:15:12,246
You call yourself a Yakuza?

87
00:15:14,022 --> 00:15:16,974
He's doing it for us.

88
00:15:17,048 --> 00:15:19,165
Please kill me instead.

89
00:15:19,237 --> 00:15:21,135
Please forgive us. Please.

90
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:23,065
You stay out of this.

91
00:15:26,931 --> 00:15:29,531
Sorry, brother.

92
00:15:29,602 --> 00:15:33,717
Never mind.
I'll talk to Aniki for you.

93
00:15:33,787 --> 00:15:35,004
Well, see you.

94
00:15:36,620 --> 00:15:38,771
Aren't you ashamed of yourself?

95
00:15:50,429 --> 00:15:52,777
You're out of line.

96
00:17:14,254 --> 00:17:19,950
I declare this to Mr. Harada and
the ten men who will become dependents.

97
00:17:20,982 --> 00:17:24,296
As you drink
the sacred sake before you...

98
00:17:24,361 --> 00:17:29,760
you will become members
of the Hisamatsu family.

99
00:17:30,864 --> 00:17:34,881
As you may already realize...

100
00:17:34,953 --> 00:17:38,102
in the strict world of the Yakuza...

101
00:17:39,266 --> 00:17:41,999
Even if your boss tells you
white is black...

102
00:17:42,067 --> 00:17:47,730
You must put aside all reservations
and agree to his view.

103
00:17:49,535 --> 00:17:53,420
Damn Hisamatsu.
Why is he taking that bastard in?

104
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:57,608
I think the police pressured him.

105
00:17:57,679 --> 00:17:59,544
There was no alternative.

106
00:18:00,866 --> 00:18:05,146
This way, our enemy is fiinished.

107
00:18:28,388 --> 00:18:29,957
Aniki doesn't fit in.

108
00:18:30,030 --> 00:18:31,928
It's like he's not needed.

109
00:18:31,995 --> 00:18:33,860
'Cause he's an outsider.

110
00:18:35,181 --> 00:18:37,650
After all, you were enemies.

111
00:18:37,724 --> 00:18:39,589
It can't be helped.

112
00:18:44,323 --> 00:18:47,154
I've been told to kill you.

113
00:18:48,218 --> 00:18:50,237
You're a pain in their ass...

114
00:18:51,534 --> 00:18:53,487
and they don't trust me.

115
00:18:59,614 --> 00:19:01,798
Then kill me.

116
00:19:01,867 --> 00:19:03,183
Come on.

117
00:19:04,217 --> 00:19:06,082
We're sworn brothers.

118
00:19:10,236 --> 00:19:12,101
Could you leave the county?

119
00:19:13,230 --> 00:19:15,863
I'll take care of eveything.

120
00:19:15,934 --> 00:19:18,567
I could go to America.

121
00:19:18,638 --> 00:19:20,306
My kid brother's there.

122
00:19:21,375 --> 00:19:23,328
Impossible for a Yakuza?

123
00:19:23,402 --> 00:19:27,319
Brother, would you really go?

124
00:19:27,395 --> 00:19:30,676
The Chinese guys
can make up a passport.

125
00:19:30,742 --> 00:19:33,573
I'll get you some money too.
Please.

126
00:19:34,830 --> 00:19:36,695
I owe you one.

127
00:20:02,128 --> 00:20:05,442
Hey, I'm supposed to die.

128
00:20:11,978 --> 00:20:14,260
Who is he?

129
00:20:14,328 --> 00:20:16,226
A bum named Sakamoto.

130
00:20:16,292 --> 00:20:18,157
Let's see his face.

131
00:20:20,702 --> 00:20:22,819
Doesn't look anything like him.

132
00:20:22,891 --> 00:20:25,722
Hey, put these clothes on him.

133
00:20:28,653 --> 00:20:30,737
Destroy his face and hands.
Burn his back.

134
00:20:30,810 --> 00:20:32,730
And plant the driver's license on him.

135
00:20:32,806 --> 00:20:34,188
Yes, sir.

136
00:20:36,443 --> 00:20:38,462
Give me booze. Booze.

137
00:20:57,624 --> 00:20:59,610
What a dirty bag.

138
00:20:59,685 --> 00:21:05,019
We were too busy getting the money
to get a better bag.

139
00:21:11,048 --> 00:21:13,034
So, my name's Sakamoto.

140
00:21:14,364 --> 00:21:17,732
When you sign your name,
please use these characters.

141
00:21:17,808 --> 00:21:19,827
The PIN numbers are there.

142
00:21:22,508 --> 00:21:24,241
What's this 1-2-3?

143
00:21:24,310 --> 00:21:26,175
Big Brother Harada's birthday.

144
00:21:26,242 --> 00:21:28,810
Says he wants you to remember him.

145
00:21:28,881 --> 00:21:30,746
That idiot.

146
00:21:42,949 --> 00:21:44,814
Hey, who the hell are you?

147
00:21:49,967 --> 00:21:51,832
Aniki (big brother)...

148
00:22:04,839 --> 00:22:07,637
My friends, Jay and Mo.

149
00:22:07,704 --> 00:22:09,339
This is my big brother.

150
00:22:09,410 --> 00:22:11,045
- What's up?
- What's up?

151
00:22:11,115 --> 00:22:13,848
Where's Denny?
How come he's not here yet?

152
00:22:13,916 --> 00:22:15,869
He must be gambling again.

153
00:22:15,944 --> 00:22:18,830
All right, let's go.
We don't need him.

154
00:22:20,161 --> 00:22:22,026
We've got something to do.

155
00:22:22,092 --> 00:22:23,957
Stay here.

156
00:22:24,024 --> 00:22:26,690
We'll get something to eat later.

157
00:22:28,724 --> 00:22:30,106
Let's go.

158
00:23:25,991 --> 00:23:28,306
You're supposed to be brothers,
but you don't look alike.

159
00:23:29,242 --> 00:23:31,195
We are half-brothers.

160
00:23:31,270 --> 00:23:32,905
I don't know the details.

161
00:23:32,976 --> 00:23:35,609
We were abandoned.

162
00:23:35,681 --> 00:23:37,546
Isn't that right, my brother?

163
00:23:39,060 --> 00:23:40,563
We were orphans, huh?

164
00:23:43,535 --> 00:23:46,937
We were put in some funny institution.

165
00:23:47,012 --> 00:23:49,843
My brother paid for me
to come here and study.

166
00:23:49,909 --> 00:23:51,774
And you end up pushing drugs.

167
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:54,089
Don't say that in front of my brother.

168
00:23:54,158 --> 00:23:56,989
But he doesn't
understand English anyway.

169
00:24:03,783 --> 00:24:05,703
Is there anything you need, sir?

170
00:24:05,779 --> 00:24:08,731
Do you have water?
I'll get you some right away.

171
00:24:08,805 --> 00:24:11,954
And what time will you
be leaving tomorrow, sir?

172
00:24:30,050 --> 00:24:32,398
Damn. No tip this time.

173
00:24:43,474 --> 00:24:47,391
Aniki, you shouldn't
tip the hotel maid $100.

174
00:24:49,461 --> 00:24:51,996
He gave the maid $100
to make his bed.

175
00:24:52,069 --> 00:24:53,802
He must be really loaded.

176
00:24:53,871 --> 00:24:56,922
Then the maid left him
$95 dollars change...

177
00:24:56,994 --> 00:24:58,760
and this note saying...

178
00:24:58,829 --> 00:25:01,397
"You shouldn't spend money like this."

179
00:25:01,469 --> 00:25:03,071
"Five dollars is enough."

180
00:25:04,108 --> 00:25:05,973
If it were me,
I'd have kept it.

181
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:07,642
Hell, yeah.

182
00:25:14,119 --> 00:25:16,467
Hey, Denny.
What happened?

183
00:25:19,591 --> 00:25:21,775
Some joker cut me up yesterday, man.

184
00:25:21,845 --> 00:25:23,348
Who?

185
00:25:23,422 --> 00:25:24,957
Fuck if I know.

186
00:25:25,032 --> 00:25:26,700
Chink.
SomeJap motherfucker, man.

187
00:25:26,770 --> 00:25:29,535
- Why?
- Must've tried to bank another tourist.

188
00:25:29,603 --> 00:25:32,072
You don't give up, do you, nigger?

189
00:25:32,146 --> 00:25:34,681
Denny, this is my big brother.

190
00:25:34,753 --> 00:25:36,288
He's here from Japan.

191
00:25:45,022 --> 00:25:47,206
Your brother didn't
run into me yesterday, did he?

192
00:25:47,276 --> 00:25:50,009
He's not the one
who fucked my eye up, is he?

193
00:25:50,077 --> 00:25:51,910
What?

194
00:25:51,975 --> 00:25:54,839
Didn't meet him yesterday, right?

195
00:25:56,965 --> 00:25:58,665
Didn't cut his eye, right?

196
00:26:00,345 --> 00:26:04,142
All Japanese look the same to you.
You can't tell one from the other.

197
00:26:06,494 --> 00:26:07,778
Maybe so.

198
00:26:07,846 --> 00:26:10,063
Well, shall we go?

199
00:26:10,131 --> 00:26:13,983
Yo, y'all gotta roll without me, man.
This shit is hurtin'.

200
00:26:14,059 --> 00:26:17,076
All right. Then you can
hang out with my brother.

201
00:26:17,149 --> 00:26:19,014
But he doesn't speak English.

202
00:26:20,271 --> 00:26:23,585
- What am I supposed to do with him?
- Drink beer, kill time.

203
00:26:26,130 --> 00:26:28,478
How much beer
are we supposed to drink?

204
00:27:15,285 --> 00:27:16,667
Let's play.

205
00:27:37,174 --> 00:27:38,490
Check it out.

206
00:27:38,558 --> 00:27:38,719
I'm betting at six-to-one odds,
all right?

207
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:42,001
I'm betting at six-to-one odds,
all right?

208
00:27:42,067 --> 00:27:44,284
So if I win,
that's six times.

209
00:27:44,353 --> 00:27:47,986
I bet ten dollars,
I get $60 back. Okay?

210
00:27:48,054 --> 00:27:49,436
Roll the dice.

211
00:27:52,755 --> 00:27:54,588
Let me think. Three.

212
00:27:54,654 --> 00:27:57,002
It's gonna be three.
I know it. I'm hot.

213
00:28:02,219 --> 00:28:03,601
Six.

214
00:28:04,697 --> 00:28:07,078
Oh, you bettin' too?
All right, all right.

215
00:28:07,144 --> 00:28:10,458
Well, if you win, you get $60 dollars.
Let's see.

216
00:28:12,745 --> 00:28:14,160
Ain't that a bitch?

217
00:28:14,225 --> 00:28:16,474
All right,
let's do it one more time.

218
00:28:16,544 --> 00:28:20,177
This time, I got two and four
at three-to-one odds.

219
00:28:20,245 --> 00:28:23,394
So if I get one of'em,
it's three times.

220
00:28:23,465 --> 00:28:26,516
All right, let's see
what you got now, player.

221
00:28:26,587 --> 00:28:28,452
Come on. Come on.

222
00:28:31,352 --> 00:28:33,217
What? What?

223
00:28:35,085 --> 00:28:36,467
Six.

224
00:28:37,789 --> 00:28:40,455
Ain't nobody gonna get six
twice in a row!

225
00:28:40,526 --> 00:28:42,226
You're crazy, man.

226
00:28:42,296 --> 00:28:43,678
What is it?

227
00:28:45,805 --> 00:28:47,242
Ain't that a...

228
00:28:48,412 --> 00:28:50,694
There's somethin' wrong
with these dice, man.

229
00:28:50,763 --> 00:28:52,683
Cheatin' or somethin'.

230
00:28:52,758 --> 00:28:54,491
Goddamn.

231
00:28:54,561 --> 00:28:56,909
Fuckin' lost $20 dollars, man.

232
00:29:05,248 --> 00:29:06,630
Where you going, man?

233
00:29:07,759 --> 00:29:09,141
Tobacco.

234
00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:13,510
What?

235
00:29:13,586 --> 00:29:14,803
Cigarette.

236
00:29:14,873 --> 00:29:16,408
Oh. Tobacco.

237
00:29:16,483 --> 00:29:19,467
There's a store right out there, man.
Check it out.

238
00:29:21,536 --> 00:29:23,071
Cheatin'-ass mother...

239
00:29:24,466 --> 00:29:25,848
What the hell?

240
00:29:26,945 --> 00:29:29,776
Oh, now ain't this a bitch?
Oh, yeah.

241
00:29:30,871 --> 00:29:32,736
Fuckin' hole in the cup?

242
00:29:33,768 --> 00:29:35,633
Son of a bitch.

243
00:29:37,471 --> 00:29:40,785
A hole in the cup.
It's the oldest trick in the book, man.

244
00:29:45,872 --> 00:29:47,891
I can't believe this shit.

245
00:29:52,826 --> 00:29:55,525
Hand over the money
for the last batch.

246
00:29:55,594 --> 00:29:56,976
All right.

247
00:30:08,502 --> 00:30:09,818
What the fuck is this?

248
00:30:09,887 --> 00:30:11,785
Fifteen hundred, right?

249
00:30:11,850 --> 00:30:13,550
No. Three G's.

250
00:30:13,620 --> 00:30:14,936
Hey, that's too much.

251
00:30:15,005 --> 00:30:18,506
- That's the price.
- We can't make any money at that price.

252
00:30:18,578 --> 00:30:21,311
Take it or leave it.
I didn't tell you to sell drugs.

253
00:30:21,379 --> 00:30:23,530
- What are we supposed to do?
- Shut up!

254
00:31:10,147 --> 00:31:12,100
You cheatin' son of a bitch.
Where's my money?

255
00:31:17,906 --> 00:31:19,255
I'm leaving.

256
00:31:20,416 --> 00:31:21,765
Don't go, Aniki.

257
00:31:21,832 --> 00:31:23,697
His thugs will get you.

258
00:31:25,277 --> 00:31:26,659
Got any guns?

259
00:31:27,691 --> 00:31:29,007
Some old ones.

260
00:31:29,076 --> 00:31:30,458
Bring them.

261
00:31:48,261 --> 00:31:52,080
Mo, get my brother
back to the hotel, please.

262
00:31:52,156 --> 00:31:54,021
- All right.
- Be careful.

263
00:32:03,810 --> 00:32:05,543
What is goin' on?

264
00:32:05,612 --> 00:32:08,114
Ken's brother
just beat the shit out of Victor.

265
00:32:10,312 --> 00:32:11,694
That's tight!

266
00:32:13,853 --> 00:32:16,289
Are you the Jap
that beat up the boss?

267
00:32:17,362 --> 00:32:19,513
Come with us. Come on.

268
00:32:19,582 --> 00:32:22,566
- Yo, hold up, man.
- Don't follow him, or we'll kill you.

269
00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:30,815
Hold up.
Then why'd he hit Ken?

270
00:33:38,997 --> 00:33:40,862
Look what they did to me.

271
00:33:40,929 --> 00:33:44,111
I want them shot.
I'am fucking pissed.

272
00:33:44,180 --> 00:33:46,045
They'll fucking respect me.

273
00:33:47,077 --> 00:33:49,228
What the fuck do you want?

274
00:34:10,254 --> 00:34:13,085
If you kill him in one shot,
he'll give you ten bucks.

275
00:34:26,156 --> 00:34:27,593
What'll we do?

276
00:34:27,669 --> 00:34:29,468
Take their turf.

277
00:34:29,536 --> 00:34:32,587
We'll have trouble with the Mexicans.

278
00:34:32,659 --> 00:34:34,194
Then it's war.

279
00:34:36,006 --> 00:34:37,772
My brother says...

280
00:34:37,841 --> 00:34:40,672
we are going to war with the cholos.

281
00:34:50,975 --> 00:34:54,311
Aniki, do we have
to stay in here forever?

282
00:34:54,387 --> 00:34:56,538
No choice.

283
00:34:56,609 --> 00:34:58,474
We go out, we're dead.

284
00:35:01,115 --> 00:35:02,980
Hit men may be here already.

285
00:35:03,046 --> 00:35:04,395
Yeah?

286
00:35:25,741 --> 00:35:27,310
Aniki.

287
00:35:27,382 --> 00:35:29,050
Kato?

288
00:35:30,183 --> 00:35:32,048
What's going on?

289
00:35:32,115 --> 00:35:34,650
I'm at war in America, too.

290
00:35:44,186 --> 00:35:47,785
What exactly did he do in Japan?

291
00:35:47,856 --> 00:35:49,721
He was a gangster.

292
00:35:50,978 --> 00:35:53,480
Who's the other guy?

293
00:35:53,553 --> 00:35:55,418
His lieutenant.

294
00:37:09,394 --> 00:37:10,414
Aniki.

295
00:37:11,262 --> 00:37:13,127
They contacted us.

296
00:37:13,194 --> 00:37:16,146
- What did they say?
- Want to meet us tomorrow.

297
00:37:16,219 --> 00:37:17,436
Where?

298
00:37:17,507 --> 00:37:20,338
At the Sunset Square Hotel at 10:00.

299
00:37:39,428 --> 00:37:40,931
Hide them.

300
00:37:41,006 --> 00:37:42,388
All right.

301
00:37:44,579 --> 00:37:47,081
I'll check the conference room.

302
00:37:47,154 --> 00:37:49,019
Where we gonna hide these?

303
00:37:50,245 --> 00:37:52,110
Take 'em out of the bag.

304
00:37:59,322 --> 00:38:01,187
- Will it fiit?
- Yeah.

305
00:38:03,765 --> 00:38:05,630
Wait a minute.

306
00:38:16,351 --> 00:38:17,733
Okay.

307
00:38:53,274 --> 00:38:56,193
Do you think you can get away
with what you did?

308
00:38:56,268 --> 00:39:00,153
They're asking if we think
we can get away with it.

309
00:39:00,227 --> 00:39:02,092
So, want a war?

310
00:39:03,156 --> 00:39:05,504
What you gonna do,
go to war with us?

311
00:39:05,571 --> 00:39:07,008
We'd wipe you out!

312
00:39:08,050 --> 00:39:10,332
They say they'd kill us.

313
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:11,935
Tell them ty it.

314
00:39:12,009 --> 00:39:13,874
Bring it on. Come on.

315
00:39:15,260 --> 00:39:17,762
Just relax, okay?

316
00:39:17,835 --> 00:39:20,019
Let's discuss this like gentlemen.

317
00:39:21,216 --> 00:39:23,597
We'll give you the territoy.

318
00:39:23,662 --> 00:39:25,879
We didn't like those guys anyway.

319
00:39:25,948 --> 00:39:30,030
From now on you're gonna be in charge,
just as it always was.

320
00:39:31,162 --> 00:39:33,993
You don't have
any objection to that, right?

321
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:37,341
They say they'll give us the turf.

322
00:39:37,407 --> 00:39:39,107
Say we accept.

323
00:39:39,177 --> 00:39:40,680
Okay, we accept.

324
00:39:41,720 --> 00:39:43,585
Okay, go.

325
00:39:57,494 --> 00:39:59,842
You told them
you'd let them have the territoy.

326
00:39:59,909 --> 00:40:03,277
Now, why would you do that
to these fuckin'Japs?

327
00:40:04,254 --> 00:40:05,889
Why not?

328
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:08,791
We're gonna massacre 'em all
later anyway.

329
00:40:46,746 --> 00:40:51,893
It was occupied. Couldn't get them.
What are we going to do?

330
00:40:52,926 --> 00:40:54,791
Feel under the table.

331
00:41:06,318 --> 00:41:08,183
Good to have insurance.

332
00:41:41,406 --> 00:41:43,754
I understand "fucking Jap," asshole.

333
00:42:28,082 --> 00:42:29,947
Where did Aniki say we were going?

334
00:42:30,013 --> 00:42:32,361
He said he's meeting some woman.

335
00:42:33,972 --> 00:42:35,354
A date?

336
00:42:38,576 --> 00:42:40,760
He's interested in women now?

337
00:43:05,906 --> 00:43:07,705
I'm sory I'm late.

338
00:43:07,773 --> 00:43:11,274
Hi, guys. I'm Marina.
Nice to meet you.

339
00:43:13,020 --> 00:43:15,851
Can't make out
if she's pretty or ugly...

340
00:43:15,917 --> 00:43:17,870
but she's sure got class.

341
00:43:17,945 --> 00:43:19,448
What the fuck!

342
00:43:19,522 --> 00:43:23,023
Just joking.
She's beautiful.

343
00:43:23,096 --> 00:43:24,961
He's just joking.

344
00:43:27,699 --> 00:43:29,081
Thank you.

345
00:43:40,640 --> 00:43:42,538
Hey, where's Denny?

346
00:43:42,603 --> 00:43:45,072
It's his mom's birthday,
so he's at home.

347
00:43:45,146 --> 00:43:47,582
Doesn't his mom work anymore?

348
00:43:47,657 --> 00:43:51,256
She got money now. She don't need
to be nobody's maid anymore.

349
00:43:51,326 --> 00:43:53,345
Right. Right.

350
00:44:04,364 --> 00:44:07,195
- Thanks for comin' by.
- No problem, man. Free food.

351
00:44:08,613 --> 00:44:10,478
Hey, Ma, these are my friends.

352
00:44:12,637 --> 00:44:15,237
- Hello.
- Happy birthday, Mrs. Turner.

353
00:44:15,309 --> 00:44:17,295
This is for you from my brother.

354
00:44:17,369 --> 00:44:20,035
Oh, from your brother?
Thank you.

355
00:44:23,002 --> 00:44:24,702
He's not my brother.

356
00:44:24,772 --> 00:44:26,242
He's not here.

357
00:44:26,318 --> 00:44:27,953
Okay. All right.

358
00:44:28,024 --> 00:44:31,657
Listen, would you guys
help yourself to some cake, please?

359
00:44:31,726 --> 00:44:34,162
Help yourself.
There's a lot for eveybody.

360
00:44:34,237 --> 00:44:35,454
Go on.

361
00:44:38,132 --> 00:44:39,800
Oh, look at this.

362
00:44:39,870 --> 00:44:42,503
Oh, this couldn't fit me.
This must... Is it? Okay.

363
00:44:42,574 --> 00:44:43,890
- Come here.
- For me?

364
00:44:43,958 --> 00:44:45,724
Yes. Here, Latifah.

365
00:44:45,793 --> 00:44:48,328
Oh, my goodness.
You know how to put this on?

366
00:44:54,227 --> 00:44:56,344
That bitch took Aniki.

367
00:44:56,416 --> 00:44:58,435
She took Aniki.

368
00:45:00,891 --> 00:45:04,040
This is nice.
I know when I'm gonna use this.

369
00:45:04,110 --> 00:45:06,941
Your friends
have such wonderful taste.

370
00:45:07,007 --> 00:45:08,477
There.

371
00:45:08,552 --> 00:45:11,383
- That's really nice.
- Let's ty this one.

372
00:45:13,703 --> 00:45:16,271
Okay, how do we get this off?

373
00:45:16,342 --> 00:45:17,724
Here we go.

374
00:45:19,497 --> 00:45:22,328
Oh, now this is interesting.
What's in this?

375
00:45:31,794 --> 00:45:34,230
They know what to get you,
don't they?

376
00:45:34,304 --> 00:45:35,653
- Wow.
- Look at that.

377
00:45:35,721 --> 00:45:37,070
Oh, man!

378
00:45:38,135 --> 00:45:40,670
- Don't ty to be too cool.
- All right.

379
00:46:17,344 --> 00:46:20,526
All right.
Higashiyama, pass the ball.

380
00:46:20,595 --> 00:46:22,779
Higashiyama, to me, to me!

381
00:46:22,848 --> 00:46:25,448
It's my ball.
Isn't it my ball?

382
00:46:25,520 --> 00:46:27,385
Don't you know the rules?

383
00:46:31,443 --> 00:46:34,658
That's it, Higashiyama!
Over here! Over here!

384
00:46:34,727 --> 00:46:37,327
Pass it to me.

385
00:46:37,398 --> 00:46:39,746
That's why the Americans beat you.

386
00:46:40,907 --> 00:46:42,442
All right. Over here.

387
00:46:42,516 --> 00:46:46,500
Hey, Minamino, over here.
I'm open. See?

388
00:46:46,573 --> 00:46:49,887
Pass it.
What's the matter with you?

389
00:46:51,787 --> 00:46:53,971
Hey, Moose.

390
00:46:54,041 --> 00:46:58,540
Moose! Moose!
Hey, come here. Come here.

391
00:46:58,612 --> 00:47:00,696
Hey, Higashiyama, come here.

392
00:47:00,768 --> 00:47:01,919
You're out.

393
00:47:01,992 --> 00:47:03,407
Because you won't pass.

394
00:47:03,472 --> 00:47:06,303
All right, Moose, you're the helper.

395
00:47:09,235 --> 00:47:11,803
I'm telling you to pass to me.

396
00:47:11,874 --> 00:47:13,739
All right, Moose.

397
00:47:14,836 --> 00:47:16,218
Pass to me.

398
00:47:19,761 --> 00:47:21,143
Come on, to me!

399
00:47:23,753 --> 00:47:26,255
I told you to pass, you bastard.

400
00:47:26,327 --> 00:47:27,709
Ouch!

401
00:47:31,092 --> 00:47:34,494
Hey, you... Damn it!

402
00:47:36,307 --> 00:47:37,744
To me! To me!

403
00:47:40,138 --> 00:47:41,707
All right, all right.

404
00:47:43,293 --> 00:47:44,675
Out of the way.

405
00:47:47,348 --> 00:47:49,246
You fucking bastard.

406
00:47:57,263 --> 00:47:59,611
Give me the ball, you bastard!

407
00:48:01,158 --> 00:48:03,989
Why do you like this place?

408
00:48:05,247 --> 00:48:07,431
I lived in this kind of place.

409
00:48:08,562 --> 00:48:10,097
Must have been poor, then.

410
00:48:10,172 --> 00:48:11,554
Shut up.

411
00:48:35,280 --> 00:48:36,662
Let's go.

412
00:48:53,951 --> 00:48:55,333
Come on, relax.

413
00:49:01,194 --> 00:49:03,992
I'm Michael Jordan.

414
00:49:04,059 --> 00:49:06,210
- What?
- I'm Michael Jordan.

415
00:49:06,280 --> 00:49:08,913
No, you're more like Michael Gordon,
not Michael Jordan.

416
00:49:08,984 --> 00:49:12,617
Don't get it twisted.
Michael Gordon. That's you.

417
00:49:12,686 --> 00:49:14,903
I am Michael Jordan.

418
00:49:14,971 --> 00:49:17,286
You know what I mean?
You know what I mean?

419
00:49:17,353 --> 00:49:19,218
Y'all got Michael Jordan?

420
00:49:19,285 --> 00:49:20,667
Not our Michael Jordan.

421
00:49:20,734 --> 00:49:22,918
- I am Michael Jordan.
- Oh, okay.

422
00:49:22,986 --> 00:49:24,456
The same Michael Jordan.

423
00:49:24,532 --> 00:49:26,397
No, not the bald-headed Mike.

424
00:49:29,328 --> 00:49:30,863
You're like Shaquille O'Neal.

425
00:49:30,938 --> 00:49:34,120
That's Shaquille O'Neal right there.
That's who you like.

426
00:49:34,189 --> 00:49:35,308
What's that?

427
00:49:35,380 --> 00:49:37,728
- You're like Shaq.
- I'm Michael Jordan.

428
00:49:42,558 --> 00:49:44,775
Man. Man.

429
00:49:47,806 --> 00:49:48,957
Woman.

430
00:49:53,439 --> 00:49:54,590
Man.

431
00:50:01,294 --> 00:50:02,764
Man.

432
00:50:06,701 --> 00:50:08,204
Man.

433
00:50:11,209 --> 00:50:14,260
Man, even if I
raise my handicap to 20...

434
00:50:14,331 --> 00:50:17,162
how much more could I win
in an hour?

435
00:50:20,801 --> 00:50:22,117
Woman.

436
00:50:22,186 --> 00:50:23,568
Damn.

437
00:50:27,111 --> 00:50:28,493
Woman.

438
00:50:33,387 --> 00:50:34,769
Woman.

439
00:50:38,474 --> 00:50:40,394
Woman.

440
00:50:43,367 --> 00:50:46,451
The same woman is going back and forth
down the street.

441
00:50:46,522 --> 00:50:48,387
What's going on?

442
00:51:16,137 --> 00:51:18,002
That's Aniki's woman.

443
00:51:33,905 --> 00:51:35,924
Ken, would you sign this?

444
00:51:35,998 --> 00:51:38,017
All right.

445
00:51:38,091 --> 00:51:39,473
Sign, please.

446
00:51:48,713 --> 00:51:51,061
You're spending too much.

447
00:51:54,797 --> 00:51:57,781
What are you doing?
Hury up! Do some work!

448
00:52:04,165 --> 00:52:06,217
Checkmate.

449
00:52:06,289 --> 00:52:08,637
That was my piece
until a little while ago.

450
00:52:08,704 --> 00:52:11,469
Once we take it, it's ours.

451
00:52:11,537 --> 00:52:13,270
Oh. Oh, I get it.

452
00:52:13,340 --> 00:52:14,722
Kind of like you.

453
00:52:19,809 --> 00:52:21,246
What's that?

454
00:52:21,323 --> 00:52:25,504
This guy isn't paying up,
so I'll send this to his house.

455
00:52:25,572 --> 00:52:27,405
Show me.

456
00:52:27,471 --> 00:52:29,391
Then he'll have to pay up.

457
00:52:32,751 --> 00:52:34,166
Hey, how's it going?

458
00:52:34,232 --> 00:52:36,580
That whore hasn't called yet, sir.

459
00:52:36,645 --> 00:52:39,794
- How many whores do you have?
- Five, sir.

460
00:52:39,865 --> 00:52:41,664
Business is slow, huh?

461
00:52:41,732 --> 00:52:44,300
Control your whores, faggot.

462
00:52:49,296 --> 00:52:51,161
Nice fuckin' shirt.

463
00:52:59,469 --> 00:53:00,906
Japs and Niggers.

464
00:53:00,981 --> 00:53:03,132
Big fucking deal.

465
00:53:39,449 --> 00:53:41,885
Hey, wanna play some dice?

466
00:53:41,960 --> 00:53:44,308
- Okay.
- All right. No cheatin'.

467
00:53:45,469 --> 00:53:47,817
I've gotta call my mother real quick.

468
00:54:01,082 --> 00:54:02,684
Hey, what's up, Ma?

469
00:54:02,755 --> 00:54:04,455
Yeah, it's me.

470
00:54:04,526 --> 00:54:07,807
I'm gonna be late, all right?
Got some things I gotta do.

471
00:54:07,873 --> 00:54:09,957
I love you too. Bye.

472
00:54:22,681 --> 00:54:24,063
Aniki?

473
00:54:29,280 --> 00:54:31,782
Drop the gun, or I'll kill him.

474
00:54:31,855 --> 00:54:34,291
Denny, shoot. Shoot.

475
00:54:35,364 --> 00:54:36,680
- Shoot.
- Drop the gun.

476
00:54:36,748 --> 00:54:38,350
- Put the gun down.
- I'll kill him.

477
00:54:38,422 --> 00:54:40,770
- Shoot! Shoot!
- Drop it! Drop the gun!

478
00:54:40,837 --> 00:54:42,889
- Put the gun down!
- Drop it!

479
00:54:42,961 --> 00:54:44,947
- Shoot!
- I'll kill him!

480
00:54:51,331 --> 00:54:52,713
Oh, shit.

481
00:55:04,690 --> 00:55:06,072
Aniki.

482
00:55:28,575 --> 00:55:29,957
He needs rest.

483
00:55:30,024 --> 00:55:31,692
All right.

484
00:55:31,763 --> 00:55:34,715
Sorry, Doc.
Hope this is okay.

485
00:55:34,788 --> 00:55:36,170
Thanks.

486
00:55:48,662 --> 00:55:50,527
What the fuck did you do?

487
00:56:23,396 --> 00:56:25,261
Keep your eyes open.

488
00:56:29,641 --> 00:56:32,472
Don't you think it's time
for your brother to move?

489
00:56:32,538 --> 00:56:33,920
He likes it here.

490
00:56:58,451 --> 00:56:59,833
What about you?

491
00:57:02,798 --> 00:57:04,663
I'll go with you.

492
00:58:06,148 --> 00:58:07,399
How is he?

493
00:58:07,468 --> 00:58:10,299
Much better.
He's fooling around with Denny.

494
00:58:14,969 --> 00:58:17,317
We caught the pusher who ran away.

495
00:58:18,767 --> 00:58:22,048
They caught the runaway pusher.
What shall we do with him?

496
00:58:22,115 --> 00:58:24,068
Have him cut off his fiinger.

497
00:58:24,819 --> 00:58:27,167
What are you doing? Stand up.

498
00:58:31,353 --> 00:58:34,239
Go to the sushi bar.
Get knife and cutting board.

499
00:58:34,315 --> 00:58:35,983
Yes, sir.

500
00:58:36,054 --> 00:58:38,040
What are you guys gonna do?

501
00:58:38,113 --> 00:58:40,230
Cut his fiinger off.

502
00:58:40,302 --> 00:58:42,650
What happens
if you cut his fiinger off?

503
00:58:44,165 --> 00:58:46,700
He can't swim straight anymore.

504
00:58:53,405 --> 00:58:56,719
How's that?
You can't feel anything, can you?

505
00:58:59,005 --> 00:59:00,508
Do it.

506
00:59:04,091 --> 00:59:05,473
Do it.

507
00:59:06,764 --> 00:59:08,146
Do it!

508
00:59:09,307 --> 00:59:12,138
I'll show you how to do it!

509
00:59:12,204 --> 00:59:13,839
Stick your fiinger out!

510
00:59:15,841 --> 00:59:17,376
Wait, man, wait!

511
00:59:17,450 --> 00:59:20,764
I'll give it back. Just stop this shit.
Don't cut my fuckin'...

512
00:59:25,563 --> 00:59:27,165
Oh, shit.

513
00:59:27,237 --> 00:59:29,256
You mother... Fuck!

514
00:59:41,948 --> 00:59:44,417
Who's the boss of Little Tokyo?

515
00:59:44,490 --> 00:59:47,376
We can expand, if he joins us.

516
00:59:51,766 --> 00:59:53,466
- Hey, Mo.
- Yeah?

517
00:59:53,537 --> 00:59:55,402
Who's the boss of Little Tokyo?

518
00:59:55,468 --> 00:59:58,036
Some player named Shirase.

519
01:00:01,069 --> 01:00:02,835
Should I tell Aniki...

520
01:00:02,904 --> 01:00:04,637
if we got together...

521
01:00:04,707 --> 01:00:06,693
like, join up with them...

522
01:00:06,767 --> 01:00:08,819
our family will be bigger?

523
01:00:08,891 --> 01:00:10,273
What do you think?

524
01:00:14,653 --> 01:00:16,551
A guy named Shirase.

525
01:00:16,617 --> 01:00:18,482
Let's talk to Aniki.

526
01:00:18,548 --> 01:00:21,730
Joining forces with Shirase
is a bad idea.

527
01:00:21,799 --> 01:00:23,115
Why?

528
01:00:23,184 --> 01:00:25,466
He's way too dangerous.

529
01:00:29,429 --> 01:00:30,811
So are we.

530
01:00:54,924 --> 01:00:57,041
You want me to get you
some cigarettes?

531
01:00:57,113 --> 01:00:58,616
No, thanks.

532
01:00:58,691 --> 01:01:00,490
Why?

533
01:01:00,557 --> 01:01:02,905
My stomach hurts.

534
01:01:05,514 --> 01:01:06,896
I'm sory, man.

535
01:01:06,963 --> 01:01:08,828
just joking.

536
01:01:12,017 --> 01:01:13,882
You're messing with me, man.

537
01:01:25,312 --> 01:01:26,694
You wait here.

538
01:01:39,057 --> 01:01:40,823
Don't give me that bullshit!

539
01:01:43,177 --> 01:01:45,163
Be sworn brothers with him?

540
01:01:47,813 --> 01:01:50,161
Be Yamamoto's henchman?

541
01:01:51,257 --> 01:01:52,639
What the fuck.

542
01:01:54,573 --> 01:01:59,523
I've come this far by myself.

543
01:02:01,044 --> 01:02:03,293
I haven't had any help from anyone.

544
01:02:04,327 --> 01:02:08,662
Why doesn't Yamamoto come himself...

545
01:02:08,738 --> 01:02:11,371
instead of a punk like you?

546
01:02:11,441 --> 01:02:14,722
Who the fuck does he think he is?

547
01:02:15,980 --> 01:02:19,832
Aniki's not good at things like this.

548
01:02:19,907 --> 01:02:21,959
This? Fuck him.

549
01:02:23,931 --> 01:02:26,762
These fucking guys
want me to be a henchman.

550
01:02:28,438 --> 01:02:30,271
What should I tell them?

551
01:02:33,331 --> 01:02:35,196
You won't reconsider?

552
01:02:35,262 --> 01:02:36,677
No way.

553
01:02:36,743 --> 01:02:41,023
If we joined up,
we'd be better off and bigger.

554
01:02:41,089 --> 01:02:43,657
I can do that on my own.

555
01:02:43,728 --> 01:02:44,945
Get out!

556
01:02:45,016 --> 01:02:47,200
You motherfucker!

557
01:02:47,269 --> 01:02:50,100
We can crush you anytime!

558
01:02:50,810 --> 01:02:53,125
Just ty it.

559
01:03:02,592 --> 01:03:04,227
- Didn't work out.
- Thought so.

560
01:03:04,298 --> 01:03:05,833
He's impossible.

561
01:03:05,908 --> 01:03:07,290
Let's go.

562
01:03:15,404 --> 01:03:17,104
Hey, we're going.

563
01:03:17,174 --> 01:03:19,456
- I have something to do.
- What is it?

564
01:03:19,524 --> 01:03:21,477
- Nothing much.
- Let's go.

565
01:03:21,552 --> 01:03:23,736
- My appointment.
- What is it?

566
01:03:55,191 --> 01:03:56,573
What do you want?

567
01:03:56,640 --> 01:03:58,724
About what we discussed...

568
01:03:58,797 --> 01:04:00,948
I said the answer is no.

569
01:04:01,017 --> 01:04:03,299
We really want you to join us.

570
01:04:04,624 --> 01:04:08,772
If you like, you can be
equal brothers with Yamamoto.

571
01:04:08,841 --> 01:04:10,376
That's bullshit.

572
01:04:11,512 --> 01:04:16,297
I'd stake my life for Aniki.

573
01:04:17,950 --> 01:04:20,232
What are you talking about, asshole?

574
01:04:20,300 --> 01:04:22,615
A line from a gangster movie.

575
01:04:23,777 --> 01:04:27,892
Oh, yeah?
Let's see if you mean it.

576
01:04:27,961 --> 01:04:29,343
Lend me your gun.

577
01:04:33,820 --> 01:04:36,289
Go ahead. Stake your life.

578
01:04:49,722 --> 01:04:51,906
I count on you, "uncle."

579
01:05:51,013 --> 01:05:52,395
Stop.

580
01:06:36,627 --> 01:06:39,008
I'm all yours.

581
01:06:39,074 --> 01:06:40,456
Aniki.

582
01:07:56,170 --> 01:07:57,223
Kill them.

583
01:08:36,924 --> 01:08:39,393
The boss says we don't need you.

584
01:08:41,076 --> 01:08:43,424
What is this bullshit?
You need me!

585
01:08:43,491 --> 01:08:46,827
You wanna fuckin' expand, you need me.
I'm the man.

586
01:08:46,903 --> 01:08:50,404
You know how many people I killed?
I got a long list of bodies.

587
01:08:50,476 --> 01:08:52,693
You fuckin'Japs cross me...

588
01:08:52,762 --> 01:08:54,561
you'll be on that
long list of dead...

589
01:09:01,839 --> 01:09:03,507
You.

590
01:09:03,578 --> 01:09:05,113
Come upstairs.

591
01:09:21,636 --> 01:09:24,818
- You did it this time, boy.
- How's your friend feel?

592
01:09:28,718 --> 01:09:31,384
You want some
Come and get some

593
01:09:33,354 --> 01:09:35,022
Where you from?

594
01:09:42,818 --> 01:09:44,353
Take care now.

595
01:09:53,827 --> 01:09:54,726
Who are they?

596
01:09:54,793 --> 01:09:57,679
Crooked cops.
They're on the take.

597
01:10:01,199 --> 01:10:02,734
Get out of here.

598
01:10:06,124 --> 01:10:09,723
Shirase, aren't you overdoing it?

599
01:10:09,794 --> 01:10:14,809
For Brother Kato's sake,
we have to make this family bigger.

600
01:10:15,846 --> 01:10:18,194
I'm going all the way.

601
01:10:21,511 --> 01:10:25,275
Don't smoke that thing
in front of me!

602
01:10:28,110 --> 01:10:29,547
Sory, sir.

603
01:10:35,160 --> 01:10:37,629
He's in a bad mood.
What happened?

604
01:10:47,103 --> 01:10:49,254
What's this dirty bag?

605
01:10:49,323 --> 01:10:51,375
Shut up. Go home.

606
01:11:03,359 --> 01:11:08,407
There's a letter for Mr. Kato.
It's from Mr. Harada in Tokyo.

607
01:11:10,183 --> 01:11:11,718
I'll take it.

608
01:11:13,692 --> 01:11:17,972
How are you doing?
How's Brother Yamamoto?

609
01:11:18,037 --> 01:11:19,540
I've had troubles...

610
01:11:19,615 --> 01:11:21,897
but I have my own family now.

611
01:11:21,965 --> 01:11:27,112
I owe it all to him that
I've come this far as an outsider.

612
01:11:35,259 --> 01:11:38,792
That's some finger
you had made.

613
01:11:38,865 --> 01:11:41,367
With that on, you won't
be thrown out of golf clubs.

614
01:11:59,757 --> 01:12:01,292
Excuse me, sir.

615
01:12:35,649 --> 01:12:39,380
Mr. Harada and my boss
sure are prosperous.

616
01:12:40,414 --> 01:12:43,014
Being an outsider,
it wasn't easy.

617
01:12:47,431 --> 01:12:49,900
Because of your efforts...

618
01:12:49,975 --> 01:12:51,994
we've grown bigger.

619
01:12:53,065 --> 01:12:55,764
Keep up the good work...

620
01:12:55,833 --> 01:12:57,731
and no rivaly.

621
01:12:57,797 --> 01:12:58,817
Yes, sir.

622
01:12:59,857 --> 01:13:01,392
But, Boss.

623
01:13:02,786 --> 01:13:05,068
Since there's
an outsider among us...

624
01:13:05,136 --> 01:13:09,153
it's hard to tell
what he's hiding inside him.

625
01:13:19,783 --> 01:13:23,449
Matsumoto,
are you talking about me?

626
01:13:24,837 --> 01:13:29,018
Do you want to take a look
at what's in my stomach?

627
01:13:30,502 --> 01:13:32,235
Bring me a knife!

628
01:13:32,305 --> 01:13:33,687
Yes, sir!

629
01:13:43,056 --> 01:13:45,240
See for yourself.

630
01:14:03,787 --> 01:14:05,202
Take him away.

631
01:14:21,203 --> 01:14:25,538
Matsumoto,
you tarnished this celebration.

632
01:14:26,900 --> 01:14:30,533
I demand you take
responsibility for this!

633
01:14:30,602 --> 01:14:31,501
Sory, sir!

634
01:14:56,226 --> 01:14:59,474
Please forgive me with this.

635
01:15:07,847 --> 01:15:10,316
The Mafiia is harassing us.

636
01:15:12,095 --> 01:15:15,376
Should we give them a share?

637
01:15:15,443 --> 01:15:17,627
They're demanding half,
aren't they?

638
01:15:19,467 --> 01:15:21,102
Well? Sugimoto?

639
01:15:23,395 --> 01:15:25,710
20% is the limit.

640
01:15:35,691 --> 01:15:37,226
We got your woman.

641
01:15:37,300 --> 01:15:40,482
Come to the Sixth Street Bridge.
Come alone.

642
01:16:01,476 --> 01:16:04,340
Where is he going?

643
01:16:04,405 --> 01:16:06,204
Home, I guess.

644
01:16:08,203 --> 01:16:10,606
Shouldn't you take him home?

645
01:16:11,745 --> 01:16:14,478
He doesn't want me
to know where he lives.

646
01:16:14,546 --> 01:16:17,630
Ah. That's playing it safe, huh?

647
01:16:54,912 --> 01:16:56,447
Isn't Aniki coming?

648
01:16:56,522 --> 01:16:59,770
No. He's got something
to take care of.

649
01:16:59,838 --> 01:17:01,440
Shit.

650
01:17:01,512 --> 01:17:05,429
You know, he should be paying
more attention to the family business.

651
01:17:19,603 --> 01:17:24,037
Hey, the Mafia says
20% is not acceptable.

652
01:17:24,109 --> 01:17:27,028
- They want 50%.
- Well, fuck them.

653
01:17:27,103 --> 01:17:28,638
What shall we do?

654
01:17:30,097 --> 01:17:31,863
It's war.

655
01:17:33,348 --> 01:17:35,630
Fuck with the Italians,
we'll be askin' for trouble.

656
01:17:35,698 --> 01:17:37,563
Yeah. We'll all die.

657
01:17:37,629 --> 01:17:39,746
I'm a yakuza
from the old school.

658
01:17:40,591 --> 01:17:43,927
If I have to die, so be it.

659
01:17:44,969 --> 01:17:46,351
Freeze!

660
01:18:00,388 --> 01:18:02,857
- Bring him over here.
- Yes, sir.

661
01:18:09,112 --> 01:18:10,494
Who sent you?

662
01:18:11,494 --> 01:18:12,876
Which family?

663
01:19:07,506 --> 01:19:09,009
Aniki?

664
01:19:12,205 --> 01:19:13,620
Are you okay?

665
01:19:17,710 --> 01:19:20,212
You don't look so good, man.
You gonna eat?

666
01:19:24,374 --> 01:19:25,394
Denny...

667
01:19:26,433 --> 01:19:28,298
run away.

668
01:19:28,365 --> 01:19:29,516
What?

669
01:19:30,554 --> 01:19:31,936
Where to?

670
01:19:34,159 --> 01:19:36,178
Here. Eat it.

671
01:19:39,278 --> 01:19:40,660
Really?

672
01:19:42,561 --> 01:19:44,130
All right.

673
01:19:47,840 --> 01:19:49,573
So, it's war.

674
01:20:20,063 --> 01:20:22,796
Hey, boys.
Here's to the boss.

675
01:20:55,698 --> 01:20:57,233
- Here.
- Thank you.

676
01:21:24,638 --> 01:21:27,403
We just killed Geppetti,
so it's war.

677
01:21:29,241 --> 01:21:30,776
You better be ready.

678
01:21:30,851 --> 01:21:33,353
The Mafiia will
torture you to death.

679
01:21:35,196 --> 01:21:37,764
If you get caught...

680
01:21:37,836 --> 01:21:39,438
take one of these.

681
01:21:40,475 --> 01:21:43,427
You'll die quickly, without pain.

682
01:21:48,523 --> 01:21:50,256
Aniki.

683
01:21:50,325 --> 01:21:52,761
You and l,
we don't need this shit, right?

684
01:22:09,447 --> 01:22:10,982
It's over.

685
01:22:12,086 --> 01:22:13,468
We'll all die.

686
01:22:43,182 --> 01:22:45,299
What a terrible thing to do.

687
01:22:47,497 --> 01:22:49,099
Clean it up.

688
01:22:49,171 --> 01:22:50,608
Yes, sir.

689
01:23:45,086 --> 01:23:46,468
Aniki.

690
01:24:11,739 --> 01:24:14,570
We are going to avenge
Aniki's death.

691
01:24:14,636 --> 01:24:16,501
Don't even think about running.

692
01:24:40,518 --> 01:24:43,886
- Denny, give me my 9-millimeter!
- Okay, buddy, let's go.

693
01:24:43,962 --> 01:24:45,695
Colin. Colin!

694
01:24:46,408 --> 01:24:47,943
So he's dead.

695
01:26:16,928 --> 01:26:18,310
Let's go.

696
01:26:22,530 --> 01:26:25,614
Mr. Sugimoto, you can leave now.

697
01:26:25,684 --> 01:26:27,483
We're closing the offiice.

698
01:26:27,551 --> 01:26:31,184
I want to update
the books through today.

699
01:26:36,114 --> 01:26:38,166
- What's that?
- Clothes.

700
01:26:39,204 --> 01:26:41,486
- What is it?
- Some clothes.

701
01:26:41,555 --> 01:26:43,420
Let's go to
my mother's house for now.

702
01:26:43,486 --> 01:26:45,121
Okay. Go.

703
01:27:22,211 --> 01:27:23,593
Wait here.

704
01:27:36,117 --> 01:27:37,499
Ma!

705
01:27:40,881 --> 01:27:43,262
Oh, God!
Oh, God!

706
01:27:52,310 --> 01:27:54,625
Aniki, we're fiinished.

707
01:27:54,692 --> 01:27:57,128
I'm leaving town.

708
01:27:57,202 --> 01:27:59,035
Up to you.

709
01:27:59,102 --> 01:28:00,802
What about you?

710
01:28:00,872 --> 01:28:02,407
I'm staying.

711
01:28:26,012 --> 01:28:27,482
Oh, God.

712
01:28:53,214 --> 01:28:55,079
Jay, run!

713
01:30:14,141 --> 01:30:19,738
" DEATH"

714
01:30:54,186 --> 01:30:56,139
There's only one of'em.

715
01:30:57,921 --> 01:30:59,621
Let's go.

716
01:31:01,300 --> 01:31:05,185
Aniki, you don't have
to do this, you know.

717
01:31:05,259 --> 01:31:07,124
This is my business.

718
01:31:58,825 --> 01:32:01,360
Denny, okay.
Go ahead.

719
01:32:05,649 --> 01:32:07,547
Oh, God!

720
01:32:55,384 --> 01:32:56,766
Aniki.

721
01:33:10,191 --> 01:33:12,857
So, what you wanna do with him?

722
01:34:09,583 --> 01:34:12,765
All right, here's how it works.

723
01:34:12,835 --> 01:34:16,533
Now, one of these five strings
is attached to the trigger.

724
01:34:16,601 --> 01:34:18,521
You get to choose three.

725
01:34:18,597 --> 01:34:20,462
If none of'em pull...

726
01:34:22,234 --> 01:34:25,251
we'll let you go, honestly.

727
01:34:25,324 --> 01:34:28,023
All right?
Now go ahead, choose three.

728
01:34:32,020 --> 01:34:33,490
Come on.

729
01:34:34,627 --> 01:34:36,009
Come on.

730
01:34:37,170 --> 01:34:38,585
Pick one.

731
01:34:40,840 --> 01:34:42,991
The first one on the left.

732
01:34:43,061 --> 01:34:45,113
This one? All right.

733
01:34:48,824 --> 01:34:51,424
All right.
Choose another one.

734
01:34:54,683 --> 01:34:56,065
Come on.

735
01:34:58,931 --> 01:35:00,664
Uh, fifth one.

736
01:35:01,603 --> 01:35:03,918
Fifth.
One, two, three...

737
01:35:09,683 --> 01:35:11,351
Pretty lucky guy.

738
01:35:11,421 --> 01:35:13,286
All right, last one.

739
01:35:24,459 --> 01:35:26,774
- Come on!
- The second one.

740
01:35:27,614 --> 01:35:29,051
Second one.

741
01:35:34,985 --> 01:35:38,804
Goddamn son of a bitch!
You motherfuckers!

742
01:36:18,152 --> 01:36:19,534
Get out.

743
01:36:19,601 --> 01:36:20,983
Get out!

744
01:36:25,138 --> 01:36:27,003
Come on. Come on!

745
01:36:27,069 --> 01:36:28,934
What are you doin'?

746
01:37:14,776 --> 01:37:17,574
Here. Take it.

747
01:37:17,641 --> 01:37:19,627
Run away.

748
01:37:29,261 --> 01:37:32,059
Denny, your eye...

749
01:37:33,446 --> 01:37:35,630
I did it.

750
01:37:40,045 --> 01:37:42,547
Yeah, I know, my brother.

751
01:38:02,772 --> 01:38:05,537
You even kill
one of your own men.

752
01:38:06,957 --> 01:38:09,492
You evil son of a bitch, you.

753
01:39:41,468 --> 01:39:44,233
Are you Japanese?

754
01:39:45,814 --> 01:39:47,898
Here on business?

755
01:39:54,957 --> 01:39:58,974
You Japanese are so inscrutable.

756
01:40:33,328 --> 01:40:35,193
For the repairs.

757
01:42:35,427 --> 01:42:36,930
Run away?

758
01:42:38,291 --> 01:42:40,024
Fuckin' run away?

759
01:42:40,094 --> 01:42:43,760
Where the fuck am I supposed to run to?
Where the fuck am I supposed to run?

760
01:42:43,828 --> 01:42:47,230
These motherfuckers are gonna kill me
no matter where I go!

761
01:42:47,305 --> 01:42:48,687
Fuckin' shit.

762
01:42:49,752 --> 01:42:52,133
My whole life is fucked up, man.

763
01:42:52,198 --> 01:42:53,866
It's just fucked up.

764
01:42:55,288 --> 01:42:56,857
Oh, shit.

765
01:42:56,930 --> 01:43:00,079
I was better off dealin' on
the fuckin' corner, I swear to God, man.

766
01:43:01,372 --> 01:43:04,170
What the fuck am I doin'?

767
01:43:07,231 --> 01:43:10,095
And you give me some
fuckin' stink-ass gym bag...

768
01:43:10,160 --> 01:43:12,958
full of stinky-ass clothes, huh?

769
01:43:13,025 --> 01:43:16,591
What the fuck are you tellin' me?
To die in clean underwear or somethin'?

770
01:43:17,854 --> 01:43:21,222
Fuckin' sick Japanese tradition
or some shit?

771
01:43:21,298 --> 01:43:23,931
Oh, you fuckin'... Fuck!

772
01:43:26,996 --> 01:43:29,180
What the fuck
is in this shit anyway?

773
01:43:33,209 --> 01:43:34,712
Oh, shit.

774
01:43:35,817 --> 01:43:37,419
Holy shit.

775
01:43:50,431 --> 01:43:53,646
" Here's the $60 I owe you
for cheating...

776
01:43:53,714 --> 01:43:55,579
plus interest for you.

777
01:43:57,674 --> 01:43:59,539
Your brother, Yamamoto."

778
01:44:01,311 --> 01:44:02,726
Oh, shit.

779
01:44:06,172 --> 01:44:08,037
You son of a bitch.

780
01:44:11,354 --> 01:44:13,373
Goddamn, I love you, man.

781
01:44:16,248 --> 01:44:19,079
I love you, Aniki,
wherever you at, man!
