1
00:01:43,336 --> 00:01:45,437
Whoo-hoo!

2
00:01:45,472 --> 00:01:46,840
G-a-b, hey! G-a-b, hey!

3
00:01:46,875 --> 00:01:48,807
It's so much soul

4
00:01:48,842 --> 00:01:50,643
Who's got the souls
of Rolling Stones?

5
00:01:50,678 --> 00:01:52,662
On the road that's cold

6
00:01:52,697 --> 00:01:54,612
What do we do? We G-a-b

7
00:01:54,647 --> 00:01:55,648
With the groove,
with the vibe

8
00:01:55,683 --> 00:01:57,167
With the rhythm completely

9
00:01:57,202 --> 00:01:58,616
Jump on the mike, I bet

10
00:01:58,651 --> 00:02:00,686
We got soul,
and don't you forget it

11
00:02:00,721 --> 00:02:02,722
So come, come, come,
come, come again

12
00:02:02,757 --> 00:02:04,691
I'm rocking
on the mike

13
00:02:04,726 --> 00:02:06,291
So much soul

14
00:02:06,326 --> 00:02:08,793
We're young, we're hip

15
00:02:08,828 --> 00:02:12,365
Get up, get up, get up,
get up, get up...

16
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:16,358
Come on, man.
Let's go.

17
00:02:36,623 --> 00:02:37,907
We've got soul

18
00:02:37,942 --> 00:02:39,851
We've got soul

19
00:02:39,886 --> 00:02:41,674
Uh, uh, uh, uh-huh

20
00:02:41,709 --> 00:02:43,954
I got it,
you got it

21
00:02:43,989 --> 00:02:46,199
I got it, you got it

22
00:02:46,234 --> 00:02:49,467
He's got soul

23
00:02:49,502 --> 00:02:50,853
I got it, you got it

24
00:02:50,888 --> 00:02:52,205
Here we go, here we go

25
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:53,171
You got it

26
00:02:53,206 --> 00:02:54,439
1, 2, here we go again

27
00:02:54,474 --> 00:02:55,542
Your mouth's
ready to blow again

28
00:02:55,577 --> 00:02:59,535
Making sure, jack...

29
00:03:04,217 --> 00:03:05,550
"Reihi was a Taniwha.

30
00:03:05,585 --> 00:03:09,189
"She lived at the bottom
of a huge lake.

31
00:03:09,224 --> 00:03:11,156
"She spent most of her time

32
00:03:11,191 --> 00:03:13,726
"taking care of
a greenstone wall.

33
00:03:13,761 --> 00:03:15,479
"The wall
stopped the water

34
00:03:15,514 --> 00:03:17,172
"from flooding
over the people

35
00:03:17,207 --> 00:03:18,796
"who lived
by Reihi's lake.

36
00:03:18,831 --> 00:03:20,733
"Once a month,
the people would bring

37
00:03:20,768 --> 00:03:22,367
"a huge piece
of greenstone

38
00:03:22,402 --> 00:03:24,537
to help Reihi
keep the wall strong."

39
00:03:24,572 --> 00:03:26,673
...especially
if you drive around

40
00:03:26,708 --> 00:03:27,872
the big towns, people.

41
00:03:27,907 --> 00:03:31,900
Hope you love my wife,
you know...

42
00:03:41,221 --> 00:03:44,224
I was just
checking out

43
00:03:44,259 --> 00:03:46,577
the weather
situation.

44
00:03:46,612 --> 00:03:48,860
A few showers as well

45
00:03:48,895 --> 00:03:50,595
and light winds
at first,

46
00:03:50,630 --> 00:03:53,427
but it's going to be
getting better

47
00:03:53,462 --> 00:03:56,225
throughout the day
and the night...

48
00:03:56,769 --> 00:03:58,469
A bit of cloud
and a bit of rain as well.

49
00:03:58,504 --> 00:04:00,639
People, I've just had
a phone call from Darren.

50
00:04:00,674 --> 00:04:02,775
Now, apparently, Darren's
just lost his girlfriend.

51
00:04:02,810 --> 00:04:06,578
Brother...

52
00:04:06,613 --> 00:04:10,606
I'd say we are
in business, my man.

53
00:04:11,618 --> 00:04:15,611
What's happening,
everybody?

54
00:04:24,297 --> 00:04:28,290
Aah!

55
00:04:31,037 --> 00:04:34,005
Settle down!

56
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:36,843
"Then the children
would run and laugh

57
00:04:36,878 --> 00:04:39,611
"Then the children
would run and laugh

58
00:04:39,646 --> 00:04:40,499
as they collected all the fish
Reihi had left for them."

59
00:04:40,499 --> 00:04:42,233
Was it a good story,
kids?

60
00:04:42,268 --> 00:04:44,336
Well, I liked it.

61
00:04:44,337 --> 00:04:47,322
No. It's dumb.

62
00:04:47,357 --> 00:04:50,273
What's a Taniwha?

63
00:04:50,308 --> 00:04:52,310
It's a creature
that looks after people.

64
00:04:52,345 --> 00:04:55,831
Where the fuck is everyone?!

65
00:04:55,866 --> 00:04:59,588
What are you doing home?

66
00:04:59,623 --> 00:05:03,310
I got something for you.

67
00:05:06,357 --> 00:05:10,350
Come on, Hu,
let's go!

68
00:05:09,128 --> 00:05:12,530
What do you reckon,
kids?

69
00:05:12,565 --> 00:05:13,932
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

70
00:05:13,967 --> 00:05:15,317
Oh, yum!

71
00:05:15,352 --> 00:05:16,633
Oh, Jake!

72
00:05:16,668 --> 00:05:18,369
Look at
all the kai moana!

73
00:05:18,404 --> 00:05:19,738
Bloody oceans
of the stuff!

74
00:05:19,773 --> 00:05:20,923
- I'm hungry!
- Me, too!

75
00:05:20,958 --> 00:05:22,073
Go on, kids.
Grab some.

76
00:05:22,108 --> 00:05:26,108
Take it outside.

77
00:05:32,436 --> 00:05:36,436
Come on, Hu.

78
00:05:42,694 --> 00:05:44,561
Got to eat them
outside.

79
00:05:44,596 --> 00:05:48,596
Where the fuck you off to?
Come have a feed, boy.

80
00:05:48,768 --> 00:05:52,726
No.

81
00:06:38,683 --> 00:06:41,084
Fuck him.

82
00:06:41,119 --> 00:06:43,404
Jake, not on
the table, hon.

83
00:06:43,439 --> 00:06:45,782
Oh, why not?
I want a feed.

84
00:06:45,817 --> 00:06:49,817
Well, the kids
might come in.

85
00:06:57,700 --> 00:07:01,700
Well, what about
the chair?

86
00:07:09,549 --> 00:07:12,034
Remember?

87
00:07:12,069 --> 00:07:14,484
So...

88
00:07:14,519 --> 00:07:17,956
where did all
the seafood come from?

89
00:07:17,991 --> 00:07:19,475
I got lucky.

90
00:07:19,510 --> 00:07:20,959
I got laid off.

91
00:07:20,994 --> 00:07:23,693
What?

92
00:07:23,728 --> 00:07:26,663
Whoa, whoa, woman.
Let me finish.

93
00:07:26,698 --> 00:07:28,066
Jake Heke, you've got
a family to feed.

94
00:07:28,101 --> 00:07:29,666
You've got bills.

95
00:07:29,701 --> 00:07:33,503
Look, I've signed up
for the dole.

96
00:07:33,538 --> 00:07:35,205
It's only 17 bucks a week
less than my wages.

97
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:37,275
Well, don't look like that.
It's not the end of the worid.

98
00:07:37,310 --> 00:07:38,710
What about
our house?

99
00:07:38,745 --> 00:07:40,076
We got a house,

100
00:07:40,111 --> 00:07:41,713
and the government ain't
going to kick us out.

101
00:07:41,748 --> 00:07:44,681
The rent's cheap.

102
00:07:44,716 --> 00:07:47,817
I want us to have
our own home, Jake.

103
00:07:47,852 --> 00:07:51,122
Damn you. We can't make
bloody ends meet as it is.

104
00:07:51,157 --> 00:07:53,089
Forget the bloody house.

105
00:07:53,124 --> 00:07:57,124
Let's talk about
the bedroom.

106
00:08:08,575 --> 00:08:11,908
Oh, don't, Jake!

107
00:08:11,943 --> 00:08:15,943
You fucking got to spoil
everything, don't you?

108
00:08:19,752 --> 00:08:23,710
Fuck you!

109
00:08:52,917 --> 00:08:56,910
Ooh, yeah,
ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah

110
00:08:57,889 --> 00:09:01,882
Scoo da da do wa oh

111
00:09:03,661 --> 00:09:06,881
Ooh, I left this mark
on this worid

112
00:09:06,916 --> 00:09:10,101
Ooh, yeah,
ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah

113
00:09:10,136 --> 00:09:11,102
Scoo da da do wa oh

114
00:09:11,137 --> 00:09:12,404
Yo, Toot.

115
00:09:12,439 --> 00:09:13,636
Yo, G.

116
00:09:13,671 --> 00:09:15,071
What you up to?

117
00:09:15,106 --> 00:09:19,010
Oh, you know, a bit
of this and the other.

118
00:09:19,045 --> 00:09:22,976
You never know when
the Queen might drop by.

119
00:09:23,011 --> 00:09:26,907
Well, if she does,
here's something to feed her.

120
00:09:33,691 --> 00:09:36,326
Bloody Santa Claus!

121
00:09:36,361 --> 00:09:38,696
Do you think we'll ever
get out of here, Toot?

122
00:09:38,731 --> 00:09:40,398
I don't know.

123
00:09:40,433 --> 00:09:41,965
Maybe.

124
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,134
You know,
when I'm old enough

125
00:09:43,169 --> 00:09:46,903
to get the dole,

126
00:09:46,938 --> 00:09:48,640
I might just do this baby up
and drive on out.

127
00:09:48,675 --> 00:09:52,675
Can I come, too?

128
00:09:58,149 --> 00:10:01,117
Of course.
You're my best mate.

129
00:10:01,152 --> 00:10:02,720
Hey, Gracie, did you
bring your book?

130
00:10:02,755 --> 00:10:04,687
Oh, I forgot.

131
00:10:04,722 --> 00:10:06,524
I just finished
a new story, too,

132
00:10:06,559 --> 00:10:08,326
but I can remember
most of it.

133
00:10:08,361 --> 00:10:10,259
Choice!

134
00:10:10,294 --> 00:10:13,230
The story was about
a Taniwha.

135
00:10:13,265 --> 00:10:15,850
Do you know
what a Taniwha is?

136
00:10:15,885 --> 00:10:18,401
Well,
Reihi was a Taniwha.

137
00:10:18,436 --> 00:10:20,171
She lived at the bottom
of this lake.

138
00:10:20,206 --> 00:10:23,139
Now, she spent
most of her time

139
00:10:23,174 --> 00:10:25,009
looking after this huge
greenstone wall.

140
00:10:25,044 --> 00:10:26,895
The wall stopped
the water

141
00:10:26,930 --> 00:10:29,389
from flooding
over the people

142
00:10:29,424 --> 00:10:31,814
who lived
by Reihi's lake.

143
00:10:31,849 --> 00:10:34,852
Once a month,
the people would bring...

144
00:10:34,887 --> 00:10:36,538
Beth Heke?

145
00:10:36,573 --> 00:10:38,154
What now?

146
00:10:38,189 --> 00:10:42,189
Been keeping
bad company.

147
00:10:44,028 --> 00:10:48,021
Was that before or after
you picked him up?

148
00:10:48,056 --> 00:10:48,265
So what's
the charge?

149
00:10:48,284 --> 00:10:49,342
Oh, he's lucky
this time.

150
00:10:49,377 --> 00:10:50,366
Two older boys
stole the car.

151
00:10:50,401 --> 00:10:52,369
He's just hanging around
with the wrong crowd.

152
00:10:52,404 --> 00:10:54,303
Still, it's not going
to look good tomorrow

153
00:10:54,338 --> 00:10:56,690
when he appears in court
on those other charges.

154
00:10:56,725 --> 00:10:59,043
You think you know everything
about us, don't you?

155
00:10:59,078 --> 00:11:02,845
It's my job.

156
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:05,049
Is she a Taniwha, Mom?

157
00:11:05,084 --> 00:11:07,450
No, son.

158
00:11:07,485 --> 00:11:10,154
Well, we'll leave
Boogie with you, then.

159
00:11:10,189 --> 00:11:11,854
- Mark.
- Pardon?

160
00:11:11,889 --> 00:11:15,889
My son's name
is Mark.

161
00:11:21,032 --> 00:11:25,025
Well, that's not
the name he gave us.

162
00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:25,970
You get those
Ionely, Ionely

163
00:11:26,005 --> 00:11:28,707
Lonely, Ionely
blues

164
00:11:28,742 --> 00:11:31,409
When you're
on your own

165
00:11:31,444 --> 00:11:34,210
Mm-hmm

166
00:11:34,245 --> 00:11:37,114
So all you've
got to do

167
00:11:37,149 --> 00:11:39,751
Is call up
on the phone

168
00:11:39,786 --> 00:11:42,353
No need to be
alone

169
00:11:42,388 --> 00:11:45,154
Mm-hmm

170
00:11:45,189 --> 00:11:49,158
And if you lose
your way

171
00:11:49,193 --> 00:11:53,193
And you've got
nowhere to go...

172
00:11:57,570 --> 00:12:01,528
The usual.

173
00:12:16,154 --> 00:12:19,872
What's your
fucking problem?

174
00:12:19,907 --> 00:12:23,590
The man can sure
pack a punch.

175
00:12:26,482 --> 00:12:30,482
He's been
behind bars, I bet.

176
00:12:33,339 --> 00:12:35,805
Yeah, right.
Bloody zoo.

177
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:39,840
If I wanted to drink
with women,

178
00:12:43,147 --> 00:12:47,140
I'd drink in the bloody
lounge bar, huh?

179
00:12:47,175 --> 00:12:49,018
I've had women
up to here.

180
00:12:49,053 --> 00:12:50,588
Come on, Polly.
Help your sister.

181
00:12:50,623 --> 00:12:52,188
Set the table, girl.

182
00:12:52,223 --> 00:12:53,924
There are reports
that they've had

183
00:12:53,959 --> 00:12:55,626
at least one sighting
of the Virgin.

184
00:12:55,661 --> 00:12:59,163
Oh, no wonder
we got it...

185
00:12:59,198 --> 00:13:01,533
Why, Boog?

186
00:13:01,568 --> 00:13:03,285
Don't know.

187
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:04,828
You don't know?

188
00:13:04,863 --> 00:13:06,302
Do you know

189
00:13:06,337 --> 00:13:09,457
you have to go
to court tomorrow?

190
00:13:09,492 --> 00:13:12,542
Do you remember
what Bennett said?

191
00:13:12,577 --> 00:13:15,446
Jeez, Boog, what's
bloody wrong with you?

192
00:13:15,481 --> 00:13:16,979
Don't know.

193
00:13:17,014 --> 00:13:18,449
When you were a kid,
you wouldn't even take

194
00:13:18,484 --> 00:13:21,250
a piece of fruit
without asking.

195
00:13:21,285 --> 00:13:25,285
You're going to come
tomorrow, aren't you, Mom?

196
00:13:34,634 --> 00:13:37,101
Yes, we'll be there.
Will you?

197
00:13:37,136 --> 00:13:39,569
Yeah. Just keep
your hands

198
00:13:39,604 --> 00:13:41,871
in your pockets
there, brother.

199
00:13:41,906 --> 00:13:45,209
Come on, bro. I'd just
like to see them smile.

200
00:13:45,244 --> 00:13:47,245
Oh, you mean
like this?

201
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:48,878
You dirty bastard.

202
00:13:48,913 --> 00:13:50,564
I can make mine
smile all right.

203
00:13:50,599 --> 00:13:52,181
I just can't make
the woman happy.

204
00:13:52,216 --> 00:13:53,384
I took a big feed
of seafood home today...

205
00:13:53,419 --> 00:13:55,885
bloody everything.

206
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:58,389
Just wanted to put
a smile on her face.

207
00:13:58,424 --> 00:14:00,742
You think she'd let me?
No chance.

208
00:14:00,777 --> 00:14:02,669
All I told her
was I got laid off.

209
00:14:02,704 --> 00:14:04,562
Anyone would have
thought I told her

210
00:14:04,597 --> 00:14:07,864
that my prick dropped off.

211
00:14:07,899 --> 00:14:11,899
Laid off twice
in one day, eh, bro?

212
00:14:15,608 --> 00:14:19,608
Poor bastard.

213
00:14:19,913 --> 00:14:23,913
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

214
00:14:24,148 --> 00:14:28,141
You're leaving home
in the morning

215
00:14:28,452 --> 00:14:32,445
You come on home
in the night

216
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:35,458
Ooh, babe...

217
00:14:35,493 --> 00:14:39,028
Fucking beautiful.

218
00:14:39,063 --> 00:14:41,749
And when
I ask you, babe

219
00:14:41,784 --> 00:14:44,435
You just say,
you're right

220
00:14:44,470 --> 00:14:48,470
But you don't know

221
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:53,233
What my heart's
been going through

222
00:14:53,268 --> 00:14:56,359
Staying up late

223
00:14:56,394 --> 00:14:59,415
Just waitin' on you

224
00:14:59,450 --> 00:15:03,443
When will you be
the one for me?

225
00:15:03,478 --> 00:15:05,589
Oh, yeah,
without your love

226
00:15:05,624 --> 00:15:09,624
I can't make it

227
00:15:19,149 --> 00:15:23,149
You're all...

228
00:15:30,314 --> 00:15:32,900
Gee, where did you
get those muscles from?

229
00:15:32,935 --> 00:15:35,486
Bro, you've been lifting
those weights, huh?

230
00:15:35,521 --> 00:15:39,521
What, you've done lag?
Am I right?

231
00:15:44,663 --> 00:15:48,030
You want to
fuck with me?

232
00:15:48,065 --> 00:15:52,065
You should learn
to pay your respects.

233
00:15:56,859 --> 00:16:00,859
In case you want
to know, it's Jake...

234
00:16:05,618 --> 00:16:09,576
Jake the Muss.

235
00:16:09,653 --> 00:16:12,989
Mmm, loving you
is all I need, boy

236
00:16:13,024 --> 00:16:14,191
I was right... too much weights,
not enough speed work.

237
00:16:14,226 --> 00:16:16,093
Useless prick.

238
00:16:16,128 --> 00:16:18,096
Cheers.

239
00:16:18,131 --> 00:16:20,029
Into me

240
00:16:20,064 --> 00:16:24,064
Am I not enough
for you...

241
00:16:32,209 --> 00:16:36,202
Party at my place
tonight, boys.

242
00:16:36,237 --> 00:16:39,617
Come on, Poll. Bed.

243
00:16:39,652 --> 00:16:40,852
Come on, Hu.

244
00:16:40,887 --> 00:16:42,053
Hurry up, Polly.

245
00:16:42,088 --> 00:16:44,422
Thanks, Bub.

246
00:16:44,457 --> 00:16:46,408
Good night, Mum.

247
00:16:46,443 --> 00:16:49,403
Night-night, Polly.

248
00:16:49,438 --> 00:16:52,328
You, too, mister.

249
00:16:52,363 --> 00:16:53,831
You've got a big day
tomorrow.

250
00:16:53,866 --> 00:16:55,499
You won't forget, eh, Mum?

251
00:16:55,534 --> 00:16:59,534
How can I forget

252
00:17:02,173 --> 00:17:06,166
with you reminding me
every 5 minutes?

253
00:17:06,201 --> 00:17:10,201
Good night, son.

254
00:17:25,437 --> 00:17:29,437
Good night, Mum.

255
00:17:44,639 --> 00:17:48,639
Whoo-hoo!

256
00:17:48,694 --> 00:17:52,679
Whoo-hoo!

257
00:18:18,883 --> 00:18:20,484
Your old man was
sure swinging tonight.

258
00:18:20,519 --> 00:18:22,151
He'll be swinging,
all right,

259
00:18:22,186 --> 00:18:23,621
by the time
I've finished with him.

260
00:18:23,656 --> 00:18:25,140
Did you hear
he got the sack?

261
00:18:25,175 --> 00:18:26,624
Doesn't surprise me,
girl...

262
00:18:26,659 --> 00:18:28,192
days he took off.

263
00:18:28,227 --> 00:18:29,861
Beth, babe.

264
00:18:29,896 --> 00:18:31,460
Dooley!

265
00:18:31,495 --> 00:18:33,497
You should have seen
the Muss in action.

266
00:18:33,532 --> 00:18:35,464
It was beautiful.

267
00:18:35,499 --> 00:18:37,067
He decked
a bloody gorilla.

268
00:18:37,102 --> 00:18:38,636
He was big.
Man, was he big.

269
00:18:38,671 --> 00:18:40,603
Fucking huge.

270
00:18:40,638 --> 00:18:43,305
It has to be said...

271
00:18:43,340 --> 00:18:45,342
almost as big as that
thing in Bully's pants.

272
00:18:45,377 --> 00:18:47,211
Notice he said
almost, ladies?

273
00:18:47,246 --> 00:18:49,879
Yeah, right.

274
00:18:49,914 --> 00:18:51,649
Hey, girl, you should have
seen him, though.

275
00:18:51,684 --> 00:18:53,684
Dool's right...
big...

276
00:18:53,719 --> 00:18:57,186
and bloody ugly.

277
00:18:57,221 --> 00:19:01,221
Well, he didn't get
everything right, though.

278
00:19:13,750 --> 00:19:17,750
Well, it's just that Bully
isn't that big, girl.

279
00:19:33,224 --> 00:19:35,191
- Whoo!
- Whoo!

280
00:19:35,226 --> 00:19:37,228
Mmm, you're hot
tonight, girl.

281
00:19:37,263 --> 00:19:40,496
Yeah, ever since Jake

282
00:19:40,531 --> 00:19:44,400
put his hand
halfway up my skirt.

283
00:19:44,435 --> 00:19:48,239
Ooh, I might have to
go home early tonight.

284
00:19:48,274 --> 00:19:49,907
Yo, Mave.
Give us a song.

285
00:19:49,942 --> 00:19:52,841
Come on, Mave!

286
00:19:52,876 --> 00:19:56,876
How about you and Beth
sing for me?

287
00:20:04,690 --> 00:20:08,648
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

288
00:20:08,683 --> 00:20:10,960
OK, OK, OK.

289
00:20:10,995 --> 00:20:14,988
Give us a G.
Give us a G.

290
00:20:15,023 --> 00:20:16,800
Well, I've tried

291
00:20:16,835 --> 00:20:19,882
- Whoo!
- Whoo!

292
00:20:19,917 --> 00:20:23,230
As hard as I can

293
00:20:23,265 --> 00:20:26,543
Just to make you

294
00:20:26,578 --> 00:20:30,312
Understand

295
00:20:30,347 --> 00:20:33,417
'Cause the worid

296
00:20:33,452 --> 00:20:37,372
It won't stop

297
00:20:37,407 --> 00:20:41,257
It keeps goin'

298
00:20:41,292 --> 00:20:44,895
Goin'
round and round

299
00:20:44,930 --> 00:20:48,616
I guess the nature

300
00:20:48,651 --> 00:20:51,161
The nature of love

301
00:20:51,196 --> 00:20:53,317
Hurts always, always

302
00:20:53,352 --> 00:20:55,404
What are you doing?

303
00:20:55,439 --> 00:20:58,607
Couldn't you sleep,
either?

304
00:20:58,642 --> 00:21:00,644
Aren't they beautiful
when they're like that?

305
00:21:00,679 --> 00:21:02,079
I wish I could see them.

306
00:21:02,114 --> 00:21:04,580
I remember

307
00:21:04,615 --> 00:21:06,517
They're just drunk.
That's all.

308
00:21:06,552 --> 00:21:08,617
All those
yesterdays

309
00:21:08,652 --> 00:21:12,652
People show their true feelings
when they're drunk.

310
00:21:13,125 --> 00:21:15,958
Understanding

311
00:21:15,993 --> 00:21:19,413
Man, Gracie, you've got
some far-out ideas.

312
00:21:19,448 --> 00:21:22,141
I thought Mum said
you were growing up.

313
00:21:22,176 --> 00:21:24,835
At least I'm not going
to court tomorrow.

314
00:21:24,870 --> 00:21:26,771
Oh, sorry, Boog.

315
00:21:26,806 --> 00:21:30,608
I didn't mean it.

316
00:21:30,643 --> 00:21:34,376
Oh, what the hell.

317
00:21:34,411 --> 00:21:38,404
What's the worst
that can happen?

318
00:21:38,849 --> 00:21:42,842
The nature of love

319
00:21:46,123 --> 00:21:50,116
And it's always,
always been this way

320
00:21:50,151 --> 00:21:53,842
So, now, my lover

321
00:21:53,877 --> 00:21:57,499
There'll be no other

322
00:21:57,534 --> 00:22:01,527
The stars
in the heavens

323
00:22:01,562 --> 00:22:05,532
Will shine forever

324
00:22:05,567 --> 00:22:09,502
Moments we treasure

325
00:22:09,813 --> 00:22:13,806
You and I in love

326
00:22:13,841 --> 00:22:16,952
So, darlin'

327
00:22:16,987 --> 00:22:20,980
Here is my heart

328
00:22:21,015 --> 00:22:24,860
So, darlin'

329
00:22:24,895 --> 00:22:28,888
Here is my heart

330
00:22:28,923 --> 00:22:32,923
So, darlin'

331
00:22:34,605 --> 00:22:38,598
Here is my heart

332
00:22:38,742 --> 00:22:42,735
Ohh

333
00:22:43,714 --> 00:22:45,080
Yeah

334
00:22:45,115 --> 00:22:47,816
- Whoo!
- Whoo!

335
00:22:47,851 --> 00:22:51,851
You're a hard lady,
Bethie.

336
00:22:52,318 --> 00:22:56,318
And you're
a hard man, Jakey.

337
00:23:09,106 --> 00:23:10,891
Play another one,
someone.

338
00:23:10,926 --> 00:23:14,926
Next time,
watch what you say

339
00:23:17,842 --> 00:23:21,842
in front of
the fucking women!

340
00:23:23,296 --> 00:23:27,296
How's that
for true feelings?

341
00:23:30,033 --> 00:23:34,033
Oh, don't play
that shit, friend.

342
00:23:36,735 --> 00:23:40,693
Play something
we all know.

343
00:23:40,728 --> 00:23:41,937
Later!

344
00:23:41,972 --> 00:23:45,972
Have a feed.
Have a feed.

345
00:23:48,747 --> 00:23:52,705
Have a feed.

346
00:23:59,089 --> 00:24:03,082
Hey, Mavis, come have
a drink with me, mate!

347
00:24:03,117 --> 00:24:04,059
What's up with
bloody Millie?

348
00:24:04,094 --> 00:24:08,094
Is she spoiling
the party, or what?

349
00:24:10,997 --> 00:24:14,997
Too much gin
and not enough sex.

350
00:24:17,865 --> 00:24:18,107
Hey, hey, hey.

351
00:24:18,108 --> 00:24:22,108
I'm not going to
miss out tonight.

352
00:24:25,717 --> 00:24:29,675
Dooley, eh?

353
00:24:29,987 --> 00:24:33,980
Strike when the pants
are ready to drop.

354
00:24:37,127 --> 00:24:41,120
Looks like they've
already dropped, Mave.

355
00:24:41,131 --> 00:24:45,131
Never mind him, Mave.
Come have a feed.

356
00:24:45,748 --> 00:24:48,728
There's still a bit left
in the bottom.

357
00:24:48,763 --> 00:24:51,708
Dooley, what the fuck
are you doing?

358
00:24:51,743 --> 00:24:53,177
You're with me!

359
00:24:53,212 --> 00:24:54,611
Got any money?

360
00:24:54,646 --> 00:24:56,664
Money?

361
00:24:56,699 --> 00:24:58,647
What for?

362
00:24:58,682 --> 00:25:00,983
You don't need money.

363
00:25:01,018 --> 00:25:04,922
You got everything
you want right here.

364
00:25:04,957 --> 00:25:08,692
You got booze, food.

365
00:25:08,727 --> 00:25:10,058
The old man.

366
00:25:10,093 --> 00:25:12,095
Don't give me
your bullshit excuses!

367
00:25:12,130 --> 00:25:16,130
Come on. Let's go.

368
00:25:24,708 --> 00:25:27,743
Have a drink with me, son.

369
00:25:27,778 --> 00:25:30,013
Remember how we used to
talk and laugh?

370
00:25:30,048 --> 00:25:32,249
We could talk and talk,
you and me.

371
00:25:32,284 --> 00:25:34,001
Remember?

372
00:25:34,036 --> 00:25:35,812
You're drunk.

373
00:25:35,847 --> 00:25:39,847
I'm not drunk.

374
00:25:40,022 --> 00:25:44,022
I'm happy.

375
00:25:44,127 --> 00:25:48,120
Then you're out of
your fuckin' head.

376
00:25:48,155 --> 00:25:52,155
Oh, I'm so sorry,
babe.

377
00:25:53,183 --> 00:25:57,183
I didn't... hang on.

378
00:25:58,141 --> 00:26:00,543
Hang on, son.
I got some money.

379
00:26:00,578 --> 00:26:02,946
Hey, cook us
some eggs, eh, Beth?

380
00:26:02,981 --> 00:26:04,247
Ooh, and some bacon.

381
00:26:04,282 --> 00:26:06,048
Fuck off!

382
00:26:06,083 --> 00:26:10,083
What the fuck's
going on?

383
00:26:10,922 --> 00:26:14,922
I asked for
some eggs, but...

384
00:26:15,727 --> 00:26:19,685
Cook the man
some eggs.

385
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:20,262
You want eggs?

386
00:26:20,263 --> 00:26:22,199
Well, have the bloody
lot of them!

387
00:26:22,234 --> 00:26:24,666
It's OK, man.

388
00:26:24,701 --> 00:26:28,305
Cook the man
some fucking eggs.

389
00:26:28,340 --> 00:26:32,340
Do it yourself, Jake!

390
00:26:33,110 --> 00:26:37,103
I'm not the fuckin' slave
around here, Jake!

391
00:26:51,128 --> 00:26:55,121
No, you can...

392
00:26:56,133 --> 00:26:58,634
You're a fuckin' coward!

393
00:26:58,669 --> 00:27:02,669
Leave her alone,
you fucking bastard!

394
00:27:04,342 --> 00:27:08,300
Stop it!
Stop it!

395
00:27:08,378 --> 00:27:12,371
It's OK, Poll.

396
00:27:12,406 --> 00:27:12,915
Shh! Shh!

397
00:27:12,934 --> 00:27:13,718
Shush, Hu.

398
00:27:13,719 --> 00:27:15,083
Shh!

399
00:27:15,118 --> 00:27:17,253
I want Mummy!

400
00:27:17,288 --> 00:27:19,354
It's OK, Poll.

401
00:27:19,389 --> 00:27:23,389
You'll be OK
tomorrow.

402
00:27:51,005 --> 00:27:55,005
Your fuckin' mouth!

403
00:28:22,552 --> 00:28:24,654
You do as you're fucking told!

404
00:28:24,689 --> 00:28:26,407
Fuck. Last time,
I got 20 bucks.

405
00:28:26,442 --> 00:28:28,125
So what are you
up to, Gracie?

406
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:29,958
You could help.

407
00:28:29,993 --> 00:28:31,261
Not me.
Waste of bloody time.

408
00:28:31,296 --> 00:28:32,527
You should leave it.

409
00:28:32,562 --> 00:28:34,131
There'll be plenty of time
for you to clean up

410
00:28:34,166 --> 00:28:37,134
after drunken
fucking parties.

411
00:28:37,169 --> 00:28:39,101
What do you mean?

412
00:28:39,136 --> 00:28:41,138
When you
get married, girl.

413
00:28:41,173 --> 00:28:43,105
Who said I want to?

414
00:28:43,140 --> 00:28:47,109
It's just the way
things are.

415
00:28:47,144 --> 00:28:51,144
No. The fellas around here
are too ugly.

416
00:28:54,186 --> 00:28:58,144
It's just a matter
of time, Gracie.

417
00:29:05,395 --> 00:29:09,388
Who did the prick
smack over?

418
00:29:09,423 --> 00:29:13,032
The fuckin' bastard!

419
00:29:20,195 --> 00:29:24,195
Where are you going?

420
00:29:31,288 --> 00:29:34,925
Out of this
fuckin' hole!

421
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:38,562
They've eaten
the whole lot.

422
00:29:38,597 --> 00:29:42,555
I'm hungry.

423
00:29:44,134 --> 00:29:48,127
How about
some Chinese?

424
00:29:48,162 --> 00:29:49,104
Yuck!

425
00:29:49,139 --> 00:29:52,541
Where's Mum?

426
00:29:52,576 --> 00:29:56,576
Well, she's not
bloody here, is she?

427
00:30:41,359 --> 00:30:45,317
Look, there's
one more pea.

428
00:30:45,352 --> 00:30:47,642
Yeah,
I know, Boog.

429
00:30:47,677 --> 00:30:49,933
Do you want
an aspirin?

430
00:30:49,968 --> 00:30:52,167
Listen, Boog...

431
00:30:52,202 --> 00:30:54,921
Grace can go with you, eh?

432
00:30:54,956 --> 00:30:57,606
Give a good impressión.

433
00:30:57,641 --> 00:31:00,677
I'm not feeling
the best, son.

434
00:31:00,712 --> 00:31:03,678
Just give me time
to wash up.

435
00:31:03,713 --> 00:31:05,582
Nothing that a good
coffee won't fix.

436
00:31:05,617 --> 00:31:09,617
I'll catch
a later bus.

437
00:31:12,357 --> 00:31:16,315
OK, Boog?

438
00:31:17,594 --> 00:31:21,587
We love the reggae giris,
we love the reggae giris

439
00:31:21,622 --> 00:31:23,295
The reggae music make you
jump and stomp, yes

440
00:31:23,330 --> 00:31:24,968
The reggae music make you
dance and prance, yes

441
00:31:25,003 --> 00:31:27,304
So everybody come
and shake your butt, yes

442
00:31:27,339 --> 00:31:29,571
'Cause this the music,
and I'm the best, yes

443
00:31:29,606 --> 00:31:32,609
And this is something
that they must confess, yes...

444
00:31:32,644 --> 00:31:34,611
Do you reckon
we should go in?

445
00:31:34,646 --> 00:31:36,177
Nah. Wait for Mum.

446
00:31:36,212 --> 00:31:38,446
Come on, son.
We're running late.

447
00:31:38,481 --> 00:31:40,216
Didn't I tell you I was
picking you up this morning?

448
00:31:40,251 --> 00:31:41,501
Forgot.

449
00:31:41,536 --> 00:31:42,717
Come on.

450
00:31:42,752 --> 00:31:46,752
Bit of trouble

451
00:31:49,626 --> 00:31:51,459
at your place
last night.

452
00:31:51,494 --> 00:31:52,629
Look, Mark,
I have to be honest.

453
00:31:52,664 --> 00:31:55,196
You're on remand.

454
00:31:55,231 --> 00:31:59,231
The cops say they
found you on the streets.

455
00:31:59,954 --> 00:32:03,954
They're going to try
and persuade the judge

456
00:32:04,642 --> 00:32:08,600
that your parents
can't control you.

457
00:32:08,635 --> 00:32:08,669
I've seen your mother.

458
00:32:08,670 --> 00:32:09,744
I don't think

459
00:32:09,779 --> 00:32:11,581
she's going to make it here
this morning.

460
00:32:11,616 --> 00:32:14,217
She's going to
catch a later bus.

461
00:32:14,252 --> 00:32:16,584
- Morning.
- Hi.

462
00:32:16,619 --> 00:32:20,619
Mark, you ready?
Better go in.

463
00:32:29,667 --> 00:32:31,599
Come on.

464
00:32:31,634 --> 00:32:35,103
Nig Heke, eh?

465
00:32:35,138 --> 00:32:38,606
Son of Jake the Muss.

466
00:32:38,641 --> 00:32:41,244
You a bit of a chip off
the old block, boy?

467
00:32:41,279 --> 00:32:43,580
I'm nothing like him.

468
00:32:43,615 --> 00:32:46,214
Yeah, we'll see.

469
00:32:46,249 --> 00:32:49,252
So today's
the day, boy.

470
00:32:49,287 --> 00:32:53,287
Judgment day.

471
00:32:54,257 --> 00:32:56,242
How bad
do you want in?

472
00:32:56,277 --> 00:32:58,228
Didn't hear you, boy.

473
00:32:58,263 --> 00:33:00,161
I want a patch.

474
00:33:00,196 --> 00:33:03,600
You hear that, brothers?

475
00:33:03,635 --> 00:33:07,635
He wants a patch.

476
00:33:11,207 --> 00:33:15,200
You'll have to get
through me first.

477
00:33:15,235 --> 00:33:18,214
Do all right
with women, boy?

478
00:33:18,249 --> 00:33:20,615
I do all right.

479
00:33:20,650 --> 00:33:23,219
Must be your
flashy smile, eh?

480
00:33:23,254 --> 00:33:27,188
Value your teeth?

481
00:33:27,223 --> 00:33:29,092
You like your
pretty-boy face.

482
00:33:29,127 --> 00:33:32,060
Call you
Michael Jackson,

483
00:33:32,095 --> 00:33:33,663
except we'll
rearrange it for free.

484
00:33:33,698 --> 00:33:37,698
You think
about that, boy,

485
00:33:38,368 --> 00:33:42,361
before you think
about any patch.

486
00:33:42,396 --> 00:33:43,638
Is that right, Mark?

487
00:33:43,673 --> 00:33:46,074
You admit
to the burglaries?

488
00:33:46,109 --> 00:33:47,577
And what about these
motor-vehicle charges?

489
00:33:47,612 --> 00:33:49,363
Will you be
withdrawing those?

490
00:33:49,398 --> 00:33:51,079
Yes, your honor,
but we recommend

491
00:33:51,114 --> 00:33:52,849
that Mark goes into
social welfare custody.

492
00:33:52,884 --> 00:33:55,218
Take your hat off,
please, sergeant.

493
00:33:55,253 --> 00:33:57,052
We picked him up
yesterday.

494
00:33:57,087 --> 00:33:58,288
Sir, it's pretty clear
that his parents

495
00:33:58,323 --> 00:33:59,556
can't look after him.

496
00:33:59,591 --> 00:34:01,423
And, um...

497
00:34:01,458 --> 00:34:03,525
what do you two have?

498
00:34:03,560 --> 00:34:06,528
I'm in a difficult position.

499
00:34:06,563 --> 00:34:08,164
I've had no contact
with Mark's parents, and...

500
00:34:08,199 --> 00:34:10,365
Yes, well, I was hoping

501
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:12,168
the boy's mother
would be here today.

502
00:34:12,203 --> 00:34:15,405
I was around there
this morning,

503
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:17,205
and after what I saw...

504
00:34:17,240 --> 00:34:19,242
I don't think Mark
should be at home.

505
00:34:19,277 --> 00:34:21,209
Yes. Yes.
All right.

506
00:34:21,244 --> 00:34:23,413
Things seem to be going
from bad to worse

507
00:34:23,448 --> 00:34:25,349
for you, don't they,
Mark?

508
00:34:25,384 --> 00:34:27,215
Under the circumstances,

509
00:34:27,250 --> 00:34:31,250
if your parents can't
control you,

510
00:35:03,953 --> 00:35:07,946
I'll have to remand you
in social welfare custody.

511
00:35:07,981 --> 00:35:09,591
Nig Heke's
brother.

512
00:35:09,626 --> 00:35:13,626
Looks like a fucking
poofter to me.

513
00:35:15,961 --> 00:35:19,961
Baby, you can fuck
with me any day.

514
00:35:20,470 --> 00:35:22,372
Now, you can either
do this the hard way,

515
00:35:22,407 --> 00:35:24,873
or you can make it
work for you.

516
00:35:24,908 --> 00:35:26,242
- It's your choice.
- What do you mean?

517
00:35:26,277 --> 00:35:27,442
You can let me
help you,

518
00:35:27,477 --> 00:35:29,362
and you might learn
something,

519
00:35:29,397 --> 00:35:31,212
or you could end up
in jail.

520
00:35:31,247 --> 00:35:33,214
Because that's where
you're heading.

521
00:35:33,249 --> 00:35:37,249
Sorry to interrupt.
Can I see you a moment?

522
00:35:41,693 --> 00:35:45,651
Uh, yeah.
I'll see you outside.

523
00:35:45,686 --> 00:35:46,628
Please try, Boog.

524
00:35:46,663 --> 00:35:50,632
It can't be
that bad, eh?

525
00:35:50,667 --> 00:35:54,270
At least you'll be doing
something different.

526
00:35:54,305 --> 00:35:58,305
Hey, I could even
write to you.

527
00:36:05,648 --> 00:36:09,641
I've never had anyone
to write to before.

528
00:36:11,788 --> 00:36:14,040
Gee, girl, you
started without me.

529
00:36:14,075 --> 00:36:17,152
Jeez, woman,
is that the result

530
00:36:17,187 --> 00:36:20,230
of one hell of
an orgasm or what?

531
00:36:20,265 --> 00:36:21,664
What the hell
happened?

532
00:36:21,699 --> 00:36:25,699
Same old story.

533
00:36:26,936 --> 00:36:30,929
Never learn to keep
my mouth shut.

534
00:36:30,964 --> 00:36:30,964
Help yourself
to a beer.

535
00:36:30,999 --> 00:36:31,773
Ah, what the hell.

536
00:36:31,774 --> 00:36:35,528
Surprised there's
any left.

537
00:36:35,563 --> 00:36:39,247
Well, you know
the rules, girl.

538
00:36:39,282 --> 00:36:43,275
Keep your mouth shut
and your legs open.

539
00:36:43,310 --> 00:36:44,654
Didn't get
to court, then, eh?

540
00:36:44,689 --> 00:36:48,689
Like this?

541
00:36:49,459 --> 00:36:53,452
Do more harm
than good.

542
00:36:53,630 --> 00:36:56,649
Welfare came round
this morning.

543
00:36:56,684 --> 00:36:59,634
Promised Boog
I'd be there for him.

544
00:36:59,669 --> 00:37:01,738
That boy's got to learn
to stand on his own two feet.

545
00:37:01,773 --> 00:37:03,573
You're going to
have to take a chain saw

546
00:37:03,608 --> 00:37:07,041
to those apron
strings, girl.

547
00:37:07,076 --> 00:37:09,978
He's not strong
like the others, Mave.

548
00:37:10,013 --> 00:37:12,015
Ah, shit. I remember
when he was a wee fella.

549
00:37:12,050 --> 00:37:13,583
Couldn't tear him
off you.

550
00:37:13,618 --> 00:37:16,985
He'll be all right.

551
00:37:17,020 --> 00:37:19,287
It's Nig
I'd worry about.

552
00:37:19,322 --> 00:37:20,790
It doesn't seem
like that long ago

553
00:37:20,825 --> 00:37:23,424
that Nig was a baby.

554
00:37:23,459 --> 00:37:24,861
Well, he's not a baby
anymore,

555
00:37:24,896 --> 00:37:28,596
that's for sure!

556
00:37:28,631 --> 00:37:32,631
Jeez, you should have
seen Jake, Mave,

557
00:37:33,104 --> 00:37:36,356
boasting about
his baby boy...

558
00:37:36,391 --> 00:37:39,574
till Nig started
crying at night.

559
00:37:39,609 --> 00:37:41,344
That's about when those
two parted company.

560
00:37:41,379 --> 00:37:44,097
Ain't that the truth?
Bloody men.

561
00:37:44,132 --> 00:37:46,816
Jeez, he was
a beautiful baby, Mave.

562
00:37:46,851 --> 00:37:48,668
Oh, enough bloody
talk, girl.

563
00:37:48,703 --> 00:37:50,696
Hit the fella
over the head!

564
00:37:50,731 --> 00:37:52,689
Tell him to wake
his ideas up.

565
00:37:52,724 --> 00:37:56,724
Bloody gangs.

566
00:37:57,695 --> 00:38:01,653
Kati!

567
00:38:01,698 --> 00:38:05,691
So how
you doing, boy?

568
00:38:06,402 --> 00:38:10,395
The brothers
can't hear you, boy.

569
00:38:34,797 --> 00:38:38,790
Timata!

570
00:38:54,050 --> 00:38:58,050
Kati!

571
00:39:38,396 --> 00:39:42,396
Brother,

572
00:40:22,672 --> 00:40:25,391
now you've met
your new family.

573
00:40:25,426 --> 00:40:28,110
I wanted to be
there, Grace.

574
00:40:28,145 --> 00:40:31,078
I couldn't.

575
00:40:31,113 --> 00:40:34,081
They'd have
sent him away.

576
00:40:34,116 --> 00:40:36,118
You've seen
the state of me, Bub.

577
00:40:36,153 --> 00:40:38,085
They did.

578
00:40:38,120 --> 00:40:42,120
They did, Mum.

579
00:40:45,962 --> 00:40:48,663
They sent Boog
away.

580
00:40:48,698 --> 00:40:51,200
But how can
they do that...

581
00:40:51,235 --> 00:40:53,703
just take
someone's son away?

582
00:40:53,738 --> 00:40:57,407
It's OK, Mum.

583
00:40:57,442 --> 00:41:01,042
Boog seemed OK.

584
00:41:01,077 --> 00:41:05,070
He should be
at home with us.

585
00:41:09,752 --> 00:41:13,745
Can't a man get some
fuckin' sleep around here?

586
00:41:13,780 --> 00:41:13,780
Fuck, woman,
you look fucking awful.

587
00:41:13,815 --> 00:41:15,237
Go clean yourself up.

588
00:41:15,272 --> 00:41:16,966
This is as cleaned up

589
00:41:17,001 --> 00:41:18,626
as I get,
you bastard.

590
00:41:18,661 --> 00:41:20,646
Tried getting cleaned up
all morning

591
00:41:20,681 --> 00:41:22,632
so I could go to court
with our son.

592
00:41:22,667 --> 00:41:25,633
Our son, Jake!

593
00:41:25,668 --> 00:41:28,104
What the fuck's
Nig been up to?

594
00:41:28,139 --> 00:41:30,673
You have
no idea, do you?

595
00:41:30,708 --> 00:41:33,574
Boogie!

596
00:41:33,609 --> 00:41:34,844
Boogie?
Is that right?

597
00:41:34,879 --> 00:41:37,678
He's gone, Jake.

598
00:41:37,713 --> 00:41:41,713
He's gone to welfare,
and you slept

599
00:41:41,930 --> 00:41:45,930
through the whole
bloody thing.

600
00:41:46,112 --> 00:41:47,054
Is that all?

601
00:41:47,089 --> 00:41:49,725
Is that what all this
slamming of fucking doors,

602
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:52,562
crying, and carrying on
is about?

603
00:41:52,597 --> 00:41:54,095
Fuck!

604
00:41:54,130 --> 00:41:55,897
The boy is soft.

605
00:41:55,932 --> 00:41:59,634
It'll toughen him up.

606
00:41:59,669 --> 00:42:01,988
Anyone would think
he bloody died or something.

607
00:42:02,023 --> 00:42:04,800
Hey, so go do something
about the way you look.

608
00:42:04,835 --> 00:42:07,577
You're starting to
make me feel fucking sick.

609
00:42:07,612 --> 00:42:11,612
You did this to me,
you bastard.

610
00:42:11,778 --> 00:42:14,649
I hope you spew
your guts out.

611
00:42:14,684 --> 00:42:16,085
You know your fucking
problem, eh, woman?

612
00:42:16,120 --> 00:42:18,154
You're too
bloody lippy,

613
00:42:18,189 --> 00:42:20,154
too bloody
smart-mouthed.

614
00:42:20,189 --> 00:42:24,189
You're a bad example
for the fucking kids.

615
00:42:26,113 --> 00:42:30,113
Always writing, aren't you?
Too fucking smart.

616
00:42:32,003 --> 00:42:35,961
You'll end up like
your mother here.

617
00:42:40,109 --> 00:42:44,102
I hate him.

618
00:42:48,718 --> 00:42:52,221
Bring your book
here, Bub.

619
00:42:52,256 --> 00:42:55,690
What you been
writing?

620
00:42:55,725 --> 00:42:59,725
I was going to
write to Boog.

621
00:43:00,225 --> 00:43:03,447
You got a good
nature, girl.

622
00:43:03,482 --> 00:43:06,577
Mr. Bennett said
we could visit.

623
00:43:06,612 --> 00:43:09,637
It's all right
for those fellas.

624
00:43:09,672 --> 00:43:12,675
They've got everything
at their fingertips...

625
00:43:12,710 --> 00:43:14,076
flashy car,
plenty of money.

626
00:43:14,111 --> 00:43:18,111
Easy for them.

627
00:43:22,503 --> 00:43:26,503
Knew we couldn't.

628
00:43:30,826 --> 00:43:33,829
I didn't say
we couldn't.

629
00:43:33,864 --> 00:43:37,784
It just won't be easy.

630
00:43:37,819 --> 00:43:41,758
Got to find
the money.

631
00:43:41,793 --> 00:43:45,697
Do you think we could?

632
00:43:45,732 --> 00:43:49,732
Yes, I do.

633
00:43:51,455 --> 00:43:54,682
I promise.

634
00:43:54,717 --> 00:43:57,818
I love you, Mum.

635
00:43:57,853 --> 00:44:01,853
I love you,
too, Bub.

636
00:44:09,498 --> 00:44:11,465
Hey, Gracie.

637
00:44:11,500 --> 00:44:15,500
Come and suck
on this.

638
00:44:22,340 --> 00:44:26,340
You fellas
are too ugly.

639
00:44:32,521 --> 00:44:34,123
Did you hear?
Boog got sent away.

640
00:44:34,158 --> 00:44:38,158
Yeah, I heard.

641
00:44:38,674 --> 00:44:42,096
Boys' home, right?

642
00:44:42,131 --> 00:44:46,131
- You want a puff?
- Nah.

643
00:44:51,175 --> 00:44:53,507
Well, yeah.
Why not?

644
00:44:53,542 --> 00:44:55,144
He's going to be
OK, though.

645
00:44:55,179 --> 00:44:58,112
And you know why?

646
00:44:58,147 --> 00:45:00,516
Because Mum said
we can visit...

647
00:45:00,551 --> 00:45:02,084
you know,
as a family.

648
00:45:02,119 --> 00:45:05,171
Isn't that choice?

649
00:45:05,206 --> 00:45:08,189
Yeah. Yeah.
Choice.

650
00:45:08,224 --> 00:45:10,092
What do you think
it'll be like?

651
00:45:10,127 --> 00:45:13,494
What?
The boys' home?

652
00:45:13,529 --> 00:45:15,314
Got to be better
than this car.

653
00:45:15,349 --> 00:45:17,099
You going to
hold on to that

654
00:45:17,134 --> 00:45:21,134
till it goes out?

655
00:45:25,142 --> 00:45:27,508
Oh. Sorry.

656
00:45:27,543 --> 00:45:29,111
You're the only one
I can talk to.

657
00:45:29,146 --> 00:45:33,146
You know that, Toot?

658
00:45:36,170 --> 00:45:40,170
Yeow, G.
Best mates...

659
00:45:43,160 --> 00:45:44,525
forever.

660
00:45:44,560 --> 00:45:46,445
250 smackeroonies.

661
00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:49,524
Fuckin' beautiful.

662
00:45:49,559 --> 00:45:52,533
Fuckin' tin-ass.

663
00:45:52,568 --> 00:45:54,069
Must be your shout,
eh, bro?

664
00:45:54,104 --> 00:45:55,571
Yeah, all right,
all right.

665
00:45:55,606 --> 00:45:58,239
Well,
bloody hell.

666
00:45:58,274 --> 00:45:59,875
I should have brought
the video camera.

667
00:45:59,910 --> 00:46:03,910
Get out
and stay out,

668
00:46:07,580 --> 00:46:11,580
you fucking
bastard!

669
00:46:15,215 --> 00:46:16,824
Hey, Muss.

670
00:46:16,859 --> 00:46:20,227
Have a win on
the Gigis, Muss?

671
00:46:20,262 --> 00:46:21,864
Look at the bloody
state of you, man.

672
00:46:21,899 --> 00:46:24,498
You're a fucking mess.

673
00:46:24,533 --> 00:46:26,969
Don't you ever speak
to me again, you hear?

674
00:46:27,004 --> 00:46:28,971
You might
spoil my night.

675
00:46:29,006 --> 00:46:31,105
Good evening, ladies.

676
00:46:31,140 --> 00:46:33,107
I've just had
a bit of a windfall,

677
00:46:33,142 --> 00:46:35,110
and since you're looking
so bloody beautiful,

678
00:46:35,145 --> 00:46:37,146
I thought I might buy
you gals a drink,

679
00:46:37,181 --> 00:46:39,615
especially the one
standing here

680
00:46:39,650 --> 00:46:42,552
in his fucking
party dress.

681
00:46:42,587 --> 00:46:44,821
Barman, 6 milk shakes, eh?

682
00:46:44,856 --> 00:46:47,891
Easy on the ice cream.

683
00:46:47,926 --> 00:46:50,891
Ooh. Forget it, lady.

684
00:46:50,926 --> 00:46:52,928
You looked better
before you turned around.

685
00:46:52,963 --> 00:46:54,528
Fuck, boy,
you're too much.

686
00:46:54,563 --> 00:46:57,833
If you want to be
like your old man,

687
00:46:57,868 --> 00:47:01,103
learn how to stand
on your own two feet.

688
00:47:01,138 --> 00:47:05,138
Fuck. Is that
your old man?

689
00:47:27,529 --> 00:47:30,497
Piss off.
I don't have an old man.

690
00:47:30,532 --> 00:47:34,101
You're still a bloody
attractive woman.

691
00:47:34,136 --> 00:47:35,671
You mean after you
take to me with your fists?

692
00:47:35,706 --> 00:47:39,106
You make me sick.

693
00:47:39,141 --> 00:47:41,143
Oh, hon, you still
on about the other week?

694
00:47:41,178 --> 00:47:43,244
I told you,
I'm sorry.

695
00:47:43,279 --> 00:47:45,147
And I told you
when I get like that,

696
00:47:45,182 --> 00:47:47,514
get out of my way.

697
00:47:47,549 --> 00:47:50,118
But you have to get
all lippy on me.

698
00:47:50,153 --> 00:47:52,688
I got a temper on me,
but who hasn't?

699
00:47:52,723 --> 00:47:54,440
You're priceless.

700
00:47:54,475 --> 00:47:56,123
Well, at least

701
00:47:56,158 --> 00:47:59,528
I try to make it up
to you.

702
00:47:59,563 --> 00:48:01,695
Get off me, Jake.

703
00:48:01,730 --> 00:48:03,330
Oh, you're a hard lady.

704
00:48:03,365 --> 00:48:06,368
Hey, where do you think
you're going?

705
00:48:06,403 --> 00:48:08,037
Sit down
and keep a man company.

706
00:48:08,072 --> 00:48:09,672
I've got things
to think about.

707
00:48:09,707 --> 00:48:12,273
Like what?

708
00:48:12,308 --> 00:48:13,709
Since when
were you interested?

709
00:48:13,744 --> 00:48:15,142
Well, if you can't tell

710
00:48:15,177 --> 00:48:16,862
by the way
I just grabbed you,

711
00:48:16,897 --> 00:48:18,512
I must be
losing my touch.

712
00:48:18,547 --> 00:48:22,547
If you're not gonna take me
seriously, Jake...

713
00:48:28,192 --> 00:48:32,150
Take it easy.
Talk to Jakey.

714
00:48:32,185 --> 00:48:36,185
It's just...

715
00:48:38,197 --> 00:48:42,197
It's just what?

716
00:48:44,139 --> 00:48:47,107
Jeez,
you're pretty.

717
00:48:47,142 --> 00:48:49,144
I want us
to visit Boogie.

718
00:48:49,179 --> 00:48:52,546
Is that all?

719
00:48:52,581 --> 00:48:54,366
Go together,
as a family.

720
00:48:54,401 --> 00:48:56,427
You know,
make a day of it,

721
00:48:56,462 --> 00:48:58,419
take up a nice
picnic lunch.

722
00:48:58,454 --> 00:49:00,856
Maybe we could rent
a car for the day.

723
00:49:00,891 --> 00:49:03,258
Oh, yeah. Maybe we could
fuckin' fly.

724
00:49:03,293 --> 00:49:04,660
It's not impossible, Jake.

725
00:49:04,695 --> 00:49:08,062
I've worked it out.

726
00:49:08,097 --> 00:49:09,531
There's the money Auntie Matawai
sent me at Christmas.

727
00:49:09,566 --> 00:49:11,100
If I put a bit
aside each week

728
00:49:11,135 --> 00:49:13,767
from the housekeeping,

729
00:49:13,802 --> 00:49:17,539
in a month,
maybe we could go.

730
00:49:17,574 --> 00:49:20,140
Please, Jake?

731
00:49:20,175 --> 00:49:24,175
And this whole day
means a lot to you, huh?

732
00:49:28,152 --> 00:49:32,110
Yes.

733
00:49:32,554 --> 00:49:36,547
Book the fuckin'
limousine.

734
00:49:36,582 --> 00:49:40,582
Horses, babe.

735
00:49:41,598 --> 00:49:45,556
Honest.

736
00:49:50,572 --> 00:49:54,565
Now, will you
come here?

737
00:49:57,579 --> 00:50:01,572
Tell Jakey
you love him.

738
00:50:08,323 --> 00:50:12,316
That's the trouble,
Jake. I do.

739
00:50:12,351 --> 00:50:13,078
What's going on?

740
00:50:13,113 --> 00:50:14,795
It's Heke, sir.

741
00:50:14,830 --> 00:50:17,564
He's got your
taiaha, sir.

742
00:50:17,599 --> 00:50:21,599
If you want to smash
things, boy,

743
00:50:21,638 --> 00:50:24,571
you start with me!

744
00:50:24,606 --> 00:50:26,175
You think you're man enough
to hold a taiaha, boy?

745
00:50:26,210 --> 00:50:28,142
I hate
this fucking place!

746
00:50:28,177 --> 00:50:32,177
You're not supposed
to like it!

747
00:50:40,440 --> 00:50:44,440
Let me go,
you black bastard!

748
00:50:48,568 --> 00:50:52,102
We are the same
color, boy!

749
00:50:52,137 --> 00:50:55,602
The British used to think

750
00:50:55,637 --> 00:50:58,256
the bayonet
was the most lethal

751
00:50:58,291 --> 00:51:01,402
of all hand-to-hand
combat weapons,

752
00:51:01,437 --> 00:51:04,513
till they came across
our warriors,

753
00:51:04,548 --> 00:51:08,548
who fought
with a taiaha.

754
00:51:12,488 --> 00:51:16,481
You think your fist
is your weapon?

755
00:51:16,516 --> 00:51:16,659
When I have
taught you,

756
00:51:16,660 --> 00:51:20,660
your mind will be.

757
00:51:21,263 --> 00:51:25,256
You'll carry your
taiaha inside you.

758
00:51:26,568 --> 00:51:30,561
Come on.

759
00:51:32,908 --> 00:51:36,908
Whoa, this is
the life, eh, kids?

760
00:51:49,103 --> 00:51:53,103
Don't even have to
change gears.

761
00:52:05,607 --> 00:52:09,600
Want to come and visit
your brother, son?

762
00:52:09,635 --> 00:52:13,635
Nah. Got something
else on.

763
00:52:13,815 --> 00:52:17,717
Oh, come on, son...
as a family.

764
00:52:17,752 --> 00:52:21,619
to visit your
own brother, boy?

765
00:52:24,689 --> 00:52:28,689
Rather be with a pack
of wankers.

766
00:52:31,233 --> 00:52:34,319
He would have come, Jake,

767
00:52:34,354 --> 00:52:37,406
if you would have waited.

768
00:52:37,441 --> 00:52:38,906
He would have.

769
00:52:38,941 --> 00:52:42,941
Visits don't start
till after lunch.

770
00:52:46,850 --> 00:52:50,850
We may as well take
a drive, eh, kids?

771
00:52:54,725 --> 00:52:57,257
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

772
00:52:57,292 --> 00:52:59,661
What's the time,
Mr. Wolf?

773
00:52:59,696 --> 00:53:02,229
What's the time?

774
00:53:02,264 --> 00:53:04,566
What's the time,
Mr. Wolf?

775
00:53:04,601 --> 00:53:07,367
What's the time?

776
00:53:07,402 --> 00:53:09,638
What's the time,
Mr. Wolf?

777
00:53:09,673 --> 00:53:12,005
What's the time?

778
00:53:12,040 --> 00:53:13,842
What's the time,
Mr. Wolf?

779
00:53:13,877 --> 00:53:15,043
What's the time?

780
00:53:15,078 --> 00:53:16,612
I said 1:00

781
00:53:16,647 --> 00:53:17,847
2:00

782
00:53:17,882 --> 00:53:18,965
3:00

783
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:20,458
4:00

784
00:53:20,493 --> 00:53:22,189
5:00

785
00:53:22,224 --> 00:53:23,850
6:00

786
00:53:23,885 --> 00:53:24,953
Spooly, spooly,
spooly ooly dooly booly

787
00:53:24,988 --> 00:53:27,389
7:00

788
00:53:27,424 --> 00:53:29,756
8:00

789
00:53:29,791 --> 00:53:32,060
9:00, widdly widdly widdly,
wee, wee, oh

790
00:53:32,095 --> 00:53:34,663
What's the time,
Mr. Wolf?

791
00:53:34,698 --> 00:53:38,698
What's the time?

792
00:53:44,673 --> 00:53:48,666
What's the time, Mr. Wolf?
What's the time?

793
00:53:48,701 --> 00:53:50,812
What's that place
over there, Mum?

794
00:53:50,847 --> 00:53:53,115
Taku Whenua Tuturu.

795
00:53:53,150 --> 00:53:55,349
My piece of dirt.

796
00:53:55,384 --> 00:53:57,636
That's where I was
brought up, kids.

797
00:53:57,671 --> 00:53:59,888
What's that big house
over there, Mum?

798
00:53:59,923 --> 00:54:02,322
That's the Wharenui.

799
00:54:02,357 --> 00:54:03,992
It was a lot different
when I was a girl.

800
00:54:04,027 --> 00:54:05,560
It was always
impressive.

801
00:54:05,595 --> 00:54:07,562
What's
impressive?

802
00:54:07,597 --> 00:54:08,929
Choice.

803
00:54:08,964 --> 00:54:12,234
It was
always choice.

804
00:54:12,269 --> 00:54:15,504
And inside
are the most

805
00:54:15,539 --> 00:54:18,472
choicest carvings.

806
00:54:18,507 --> 00:54:20,108
Oh, and inside
are photos

807
00:54:20,143 --> 00:54:22,075
of the old people

808
00:54:22,110 --> 00:54:23,677
and the Tukutuku
panels.

809
00:54:23,712 --> 00:54:27,712
You know, I used to
help Nannie

810
00:54:27,934 --> 00:54:31,934
and Auntie Matawai
repair them.

811
00:54:32,087 --> 00:54:36,080
Well, why don't we
ever go there, Mum?

812
00:54:36,091 --> 00:54:36,892
One day we'll all
end up there.

813
00:54:36,927 --> 00:54:37,727
See over there
to the right?

814
00:54:37,728 --> 00:54:40,196
That's the Urupa...

815
00:54:40,231 --> 00:54:42,629
the family cemetery.

816
00:54:42,664 --> 00:54:46,134
All my family
are buried there.

817
00:54:46,169 --> 00:54:49,883
I'd love to go
and see them.

818
00:54:49,918 --> 00:54:53,597
Not before me,
you don't.

819
00:54:53,632 --> 00:54:54,108
Your father and I

820
00:54:54,109 --> 00:54:57,946
were going to get
hitched there.

821
00:54:57,981 --> 00:55:01,981
Except we didn't.

822
00:55:03,051 --> 00:55:07,051
I wasn't bloody
good enough...

823
00:55:08,024 --> 00:55:12,024
not for their
royal highness.

824
00:55:12,928 --> 00:55:16,921
Tell them everything,
why don't you?

825
00:55:16,956 --> 00:55:20,013
Your mother
was beautiful...

826
00:55:20,048 --> 00:55:23,036
pride
of the fucking tribe...

827
00:55:23,071 --> 00:55:25,374
And this old
black-ass comes along

828
00:55:25,409 --> 00:55:27,507
and steals her away.

829
00:55:27,542 --> 00:55:31,542
And you know where
I come from, kids?

830
00:55:36,686 --> 00:55:40,644
A long line of slaves.

831
00:55:41,089 --> 00:55:43,056
Fucking slaves.

832
00:55:43,091 --> 00:55:47,091
I'd like to see
those wankers

833
00:55:49,910 --> 00:55:53,910
call Jake the Muss
that now.

834
00:55:56,538 --> 00:56:00,041
Ah, this place
gives me the creeps.

835
00:56:00,076 --> 00:56:02,142
Come on, kids.

836
00:56:02,177 --> 00:56:06,177
Doesn't give me
the creeps.

837
00:56:13,089 --> 00:56:17,089
You never met
my grandmother.

838
00:56:23,967 --> 00:56:26,800
Eh, Jake?

839
00:56:26,835 --> 00:56:28,236
Just want to show
our flash car to my mates.

840
00:56:28,271 --> 00:56:32,271
Whoa, bro,
you know what

841
00:56:34,976 --> 00:56:38,969
the penalty is
for car theft?

842
00:56:39,004 --> 00:56:39,148
Just one beer, huh?

843
00:56:39,149 --> 00:56:41,417
One, Jake.

844
00:56:41,452 --> 00:56:43,685
Just the one.

845
00:56:43,720 --> 00:56:47,720
Promise?

846
00:56:49,691 --> 00:56:53,684
Cross my heart.

847
00:56:53,719 --> 00:56:53,895
Cheer.

848
00:56:53,930 --> 00:56:54,813
Cheer.

849
00:56:54,848 --> 00:56:55,773
Ah, cheer.

850
00:56:55,808 --> 00:56:56,698
Cheer, bro.

851
00:56:56,733 --> 00:57:00,185
Cheer.

852
00:57:00,220 --> 00:57:03,603
Cheer.

853
00:57:03,638 --> 00:57:05,605
How long is Dad
gonna be?

854
00:57:05,640 --> 00:57:07,209
I'd get that tone
out of your voice

855
00:57:07,244 --> 00:57:09,042
if I were you.

856
00:57:09,077 --> 00:57:10,912
How many times have
you seen your father

857
00:57:10,947 --> 00:57:13,046
like today, Grace?

858
00:57:13,081 --> 00:57:15,916
Never...
that's how many,

859
00:57:15,951 --> 00:57:17,819
so just give him
a chance, eh?

860
00:57:17,854 --> 00:57:19,838
Now running on the track,

861
00:57:19,873 --> 00:57:21,565
it's Robin the Fair...

862
00:57:21,600 --> 00:57:23,647
Bethie!
Name your poison.

863
00:57:23,682 --> 00:57:25,659
Oh, no, thanks,
Dooley.

864
00:57:25,694 --> 00:57:26,828
Jake and I are going to
visit our son Boogie.

865
00:57:26,863 --> 00:57:27,961
Aren't we, Jake?

866
00:57:27,996 --> 00:57:29,529
Yeah, yeah.
Just a minute.

867
00:57:29,564 --> 00:57:30,565
I'm trying to listen
to the horse race.

868
00:57:30,600 --> 00:57:31,934
You promised, Jake.

869
00:57:31,969 --> 00:57:33,233
Shut up, woman.

870
00:57:33,268 --> 00:57:34,836
You'll make me miss
who won the fuckin' race.

871
00:57:34,871 --> 00:57:36,071
The kids are hungry.

872
00:57:36,106 --> 00:57:37,237
Well, feed them.

873
00:57:37,272 --> 00:57:40,275
You got bootloads
of the stuff.

874
00:57:40,310 --> 00:57:44,310
We'll be waiting.

875
00:57:54,289 --> 00:57:58,282
Come on, come on.
Come up, come up.

876
00:57:58,317 --> 00:57:58,826
So he's not coming?

877
00:57:58,827 --> 00:58:00,829
Oh, he's coming,
all right.

878
00:58:00,864 --> 00:58:01,830
You're hopeful.

879
00:58:01,865 --> 00:58:05,665
No, Grace.

880
00:58:05,700 --> 00:58:09,700
It's just a woman's
lot, that's all.

881
00:58:45,308 --> 00:58:47,092
One day
you'll understand.

882
00:58:47,127 --> 00:58:48,877
No, no, no,
no, no, no.

883
00:58:48,912 --> 00:58:51,244
Stop, stop.

884
00:58:51,279 --> 00:58:53,081
It's good, but it's
not good enough!

885
00:58:53,116 --> 00:58:54,883
I've told you fellas
time and again,

886
00:58:54,918 --> 00:58:58,918
this haka won't work

887
00:58:59,254 --> 00:59:01,788
until you get
the first action right!

888
00:59:01,823 --> 00:59:04,259
You're reaching up
for all these ancestral lines,

889
00:59:04,294 --> 00:59:07,262
and you're pulling them
down into your body!

890
00:59:07,297 --> 00:59:09,229
The weight
of your ancestors.

891
00:59:09,264 --> 00:59:11,266
Some of you look
as though you're reaching

892
00:59:11,301 --> 00:59:14,703
for butterflies
or something.

893
00:59:14,738 --> 00:59:18,738
Now, let's do it again...

894
00:59:22,012 --> 00:59:25,714
and wake up!

895
00:59:25,749 --> 00:59:29,382
And I in love

896
00:59:29,417 --> 00:59:33,410
So, darling,
here is my heart

897
00:59:33,445 --> 00:59:34,617
Give me
the keys, Jake.

898
00:59:34,652 --> 00:59:35,790
I said, give me
the keys.

899
00:59:35,825 --> 00:59:37,190
What for?

900
00:59:37,225 --> 00:59:38,660
I'm going to
visit Boogie.

901
00:59:38,695 --> 00:59:40,126
Bad idea.

902
00:59:40,161 --> 00:59:41,730
The problem is
you've spoiled the boy.

903
00:59:41,765 --> 00:59:42,964
You've got to
toughen him up.

904
00:59:42,999 --> 00:59:45,265
Give me
the bloody keys!

905
00:59:45,300 --> 00:59:46,334
That's it, woman.
Just fuck off!

906
00:59:46,369 --> 00:59:50,369
Take a bloody taxi.

907
00:59:55,310 --> 00:59:59,303
You got all my
bloody money.

908
00:59:59,338 --> 01:00:00,280
Fuck.

909
01:00:00,315 --> 01:00:04,315
I remember

910
01:00:14,663 --> 01:00:17,897
All those yesterdays

911
01:00:17,932 --> 01:00:19,701
We'll walk around
to the taxi stand.

912
01:00:19,736 --> 01:00:21,353
Taxi? What for?

913
01:00:21,388 --> 01:00:22,936
We're going home.

914
01:00:22,971 --> 01:00:24,005
No. We're going
to see Boogie.

915
01:00:24,040 --> 01:00:26,640
You promised.

916
01:00:26,675 --> 01:00:29,109
Please, Grace,
try to understand.

917
01:00:29,144 --> 01:00:33,144
I don't want to listen
to any more of your lies.

918
01:00:39,055 --> 01:00:43,013
I hate you!
I hate you both!

919
01:00:57,305 --> 01:00:59,674
Come on, kids.

920
01:00:59,709 --> 01:01:02,008
Boogie? Son?

921
01:01:02,043 --> 01:01:05,211
We were
on our way.

922
01:01:05,246 --> 01:01:07,482
We rented a car
for the trip.

923
01:01:07,517 --> 01:01:09,718
We had a bit
of an accident, son.

924
01:01:09,753 --> 01:01:11,084
Oh, well, you know

925
01:01:11,119 --> 01:01:13,353
what your father's like

926
01:01:13,388 --> 01:01:15,690
when he gets
behind the wheel.

927
01:01:15,725 --> 01:01:17,992
Had a picnic lunch
all prepared.

928
01:01:18,027 --> 01:01:22,027
Stayed up all last night.

929
01:01:23,711 --> 01:01:27,711
I got in
just what you like.

930
01:02:16,918 --> 01:02:18,518
It was just
a stupid accident.

931
01:02:18,553 --> 01:02:20,121
Whoa. Party at
my place tonight, boys.

932
01:02:20,156 --> 01:02:21,521
- Hello!
- Hey!

933
01:02:21,556 --> 01:02:22,924
Fuck. I need to piss.

934
01:02:22,959 --> 01:02:26,959
Thanks, mate.

935
01:02:34,435 --> 01:02:38,428
We really needed
to know that.

936
01:02:38,463 --> 01:02:39,519
Bethie, you awake?

937
01:02:39,554 --> 01:02:40,575
Come party with us.

938
01:02:40,610 --> 01:02:44,610
No.

939
01:02:55,490 --> 01:02:56,923
No more, Jake.

940
01:02:56,958 --> 01:02:57,992
I could tell
straightaway

941
01:02:58,027 --> 01:02:59,359
it was a holding.

942
01:02:59,394 --> 01:03:00,912
What's more, it's
my mate's holding.

943
01:03:00,947 --> 01:03:02,430
Next thing I know,
I give him a smack.

944
01:03:02,465 --> 01:03:06,465
Oh, if it isn't
Gracie.

945
01:03:07,454 --> 01:03:11,454
Hu wanted
some water.

946
01:03:12,373 --> 01:03:16,366
Come and give
your uncle a kiss.

947
01:03:17,846 --> 01:03:21,481
You're growing up
fast, girl.

948
01:03:21,516 --> 01:03:22,517
She's in bed,
where you should be.

949
01:03:22,552 --> 01:03:24,417
What happened then,
Jake?

950
01:03:24,452 --> 01:03:25,587
He comes back at me
with this crowbar.

951
01:03:25,622 --> 01:03:26,853
Yeah? And then what?

952
01:03:26,888 --> 01:03:28,940
I take the crowbar
off him

953
01:03:28,975 --> 01:03:30,992
and give him
another smack.

954
01:03:31,027 --> 01:03:35,027
Good night, Hu.

955
01:03:51,526 --> 01:03:55,526
Night-night.

956
01:04:10,999 --> 01:04:14,367
Shh. Shh.
It's OK, Gracie.

957
01:04:14,402 --> 01:04:16,471
Uncle Bully is going
to be gentle with you...

958
01:04:16,506 --> 01:04:17,939
as gentle as a lamb.

959
01:04:17,974 --> 01:04:21,974
Shh.

960
01:04:25,413 --> 01:04:27,113
Shh. Shh.

961
01:04:27,148 --> 01:04:28,416
Your mum and dad
are going to be

962
01:04:28,451 --> 01:04:29,582
real angry at you,

963
01:04:29,617 --> 01:04:33,617
turning me on
like that...

964
01:04:34,056 --> 01:04:38,056
coming downstairs
in nothing

965
01:04:38,272 --> 01:04:42,272
but that flimsy
little nightie.

966
01:05:38,353 --> 01:05:42,346
Shh, shh, shh.

967
01:05:43,458 --> 01:05:47,451
It's our secret,
hey, Gracie?

968
01:05:47,486 --> 01:05:51,486
You hear me, girl?

969
01:06:18,818 --> 01:06:22,818
Keep your mouth shut.

970
01:07:41,175 --> 01:07:43,277
Did Huata wet
the bed again, Bub?

971
01:07:43,312 --> 01:07:44,745
You should have
left it.

972
01:07:44,780 --> 01:07:46,881
I'd have
done that.

973
01:07:46,916 --> 01:07:48,449
Just go away.

974
01:07:48,484 --> 01:07:49,849
Go away.

975
01:07:49,884 --> 01:07:51,486
Look, I don't
blame you, Grace.

976
01:07:51,521 --> 01:07:52,887
I wanted
to see Boogie

977
01:07:52,922 --> 01:07:55,154
as much as you.

978
01:07:55,189 --> 01:07:58,742
You don't care
about any of us.

979
01:07:58,777 --> 01:08:02,296
That's not true.
I love you all.

980
01:08:02,331 --> 01:08:06,289
But you're a liar!

981
01:08:06,324 --> 01:08:06,433
Go on...

982
01:08:06,434 --> 01:08:08,267
got your period, Bub.

983
01:08:08,302 --> 01:08:12,302
It's bound to make you
a bit uptight...

984
01:08:30,893 --> 01:08:32,825
Get out! Get out!

985
01:08:32,860 --> 01:08:34,527
What's
for breakfast?

986
01:08:34,562 --> 01:08:36,164
You want something
to eat,

987
01:08:36,199 --> 01:08:37,899
fix it yourself.

988
01:08:37,934 --> 01:08:39,565
Give me a coffee.

989
01:08:39,600 --> 01:08:43,302
Go and have
a wash, Jake.

990
01:08:43,337 --> 01:08:46,674
Clean your ears out
while you're at it.

991
01:08:46,709 --> 01:08:50,176
What the fuck's
up with you?

992
01:08:50,211 --> 01:08:52,380
I'm not going to
take this anymore.

993
01:08:52,415 --> 01:08:54,482
Do you hear me,
Jake Heke?

994
01:08:54,517 --> 01:08:58,517
No more.

995
01:08:58,553 --> 01:09:00,486
We never
got to see Boogie.

996
01:09:00,521 --> 01:09:02,890
I don't want any more
of these drunken parties

997
01:09:02,925 --> 01:09:05,259
or your bloody ugly
mongrel mates coming around.

998
01:09:05,294 --> 01:09:07,326
It's no good...

999
01:09:07,361 --> 01:09:11,361
no good for the kids,

1000
01:09:13,467 --> 01:09:17,460
especially now Grace
is growing.

1001
01:09:17,471 --> 01:09:20,040
Who the fuck do you
think you are, eh?

1002
01:09:20,075 --> 01:09:22,610
Sitting there like
Lady Bloody Muck,

1003
01:09:22,645 --> 01:09:25,163
telling me
in my own house

1004
01:09:25,198 --> 01:09:27,647
who I can
and can't have here.

1005
01:09:27,682 --> 01:09:28,983
Well, I've asked
them back tonight,

1006
01:09:29,018 --> 01:09:30,284
and you'd better
be ready for it.

1007
01:09:30,319 --> 01:09:32,852
Do you hear me?!

1008
01:09:32,887 --> 01:09:34,655
Now, get off
your fat ass

1009
01:09:34,690 --> 01:09:36,808
and get busy.

1010
01:09:36,843 --> 01:09:38,891
Oh, Grace!

1011
01:09:38,926 --> 01:09:40,327
You know,
that's your problem.

1012
01:09:40,362 --> 01:09:41,694
You spoil
the lot of them!

1013
01:09:41,729 --> 01:09:43,497
No wonder they're all
so fucking screwed up!

1014
01:09:43,532 --> 01:09:44,899
It's got nothing
to do with you,

1015
01:09:44,934 --> 01:09:47,600
eh, Jake Heke?

1016
01:09:47,635 --> 01:09:49,237
You're such
good father material!

1017
01:09:49,272 --> 01:09:53,272
You chased Nig off!

1018
01:09:55,243 --> 01:09:59,236
You couldn't give a damn
about Boogie!

1019
01:09:59,513 --> 01:10:03,506
You're not gonna
hurt my babies anymore...

1020
01:10:04,252 --> 01:10:08,245
not while I can do
something about it.

1021
01:10:08,256 --> 01:10:10,291
Oh, you want
something to eat?

1022
01:10:10,326 --> 01:10:14,326
Learn how to cook.

1023
01:10:14,430 --> 01:10:18,388
Grace!

1024
01:10:26,707 --> 01:10:30,700
Grace!

1025
01:10:33,581 --> 01:10:35,548
What's up?

1026
01:10:35,583 --> 01:10:39,583
I said, what's up?

1027
01:10:44,425 --> 01:10:46,527
How long have you
been sitting there?

1028
01:10:46,562 --> 01:10:48,629
Why is everything
so black, Toot?

1029
01:10:48,664 --> 01:10:52,664
Don't know.

1030
01:10:59,540 --> 01:11:03,533
Maybe 'cause we're
all bloody Maoris.

1031
01:11:03,568 --> 01:11:04,044
You got something...

1032
01:11:04,045 --> 01:11:05,429
you got something
to sniff?

1033
01:11:05,464 --> 01:11:06,814
Yeah. A couple
of old socks.

1034
01:11:06,849 --> 01:11:08,381
What's going on, G?

1035
01:11:08,416 --> 01:11:12,103
I thought you said
we were best friends.

1036
01:11:12,138 --> 01:11:15,790
If you're too bloody mean,
just forget it.

1037
01:11:15,825 --> 01:11:18,326
Hang on. Hang on.

1038
01:11:18,361 --> 01:11:20,793
No glue, OK? OK?

1039
01:11:20,828 --> 01:11:24,828
But I've got
some dope.

1040
01:11:29,866 --> 01:11:33,866
You want
some of that?

1041
01:11:41,382 --> 01:11:43,234
What's going on
with you, Bub?

1042
01:11:43,269 --> 01:11:45,086
What colors are you
seeing now, G?

1043
01:11:45,121 --> 01:11:49,121
Still all black?

1044
01:11:54,829 --> 01:11:58,822
Not an old black
in sight.

1045
01:12:02,169 --> 01:12:06,162
Notice how you never see black
in a rainbow, do you?

1046
01:12:06,173 --> 01:12:08,642
Just bright colors.

1047
01:12:08,677 --> 01:12:11,077
Must be their pot.

1048
01:12:11,112 --> 01:12:13,848
You know, the pot at
the end of the thing.

1049
01:12:13,883 --> 01:12:17,883
Oh, dumb.

1050
01:12:21,889 --> 01:12:24,857
Pot... the end
of the thing.

1051
01:12:24,892 --> 01:12:26,727
You're just like
everyone else around here.

1052
01:12:26,762 --> 01:12:28,429
I'm... I'm sorry.
I didn't mean it.

1053
01:12:28,464 --> 01:12:32,464
You're just
a stupid kid

1054
01:12:33,834 --> 01:12:37,827
that lives in
an old wreck of a car.

1055
01:12:37,862 --> 01:12:38,671
G! G! Come back, G!

1056
01:12:38,706 --> 01:12:41,976
G, come back!
What did I do?

1057
01:12:42,011 --> 01:12:45,363
Please, G!

1058
01:12:45,398 --> 01:12:48,575
I'm sorry!

1059
01:12:48,610 --> 01:12:51,717
Please.

1060
01:12:51,752 --> 01:12:54,188
This is the day
that the Lord has made

1061
01:12:54,223 --> 01:12:56,056
That the Lord
has made

1062
01:12:56,091 --> 01:12:59,392
We will rejoice

1063
01:12:59,427 --> 01:13:00,728
We will rejoice
and be glad in it

1064
01:13:00,763 --> 01:13:02,962
And be glad in it

1065
01:13:02,997 --> 01:13:06,217
Whoa, for this
is the day

1066
01:13:06,252 --> 01:13:09,402
That the Lord
has made

1067
01:13:09,437 --> 01:13:13,090
We will rejoice
and be glad in it

1068
01:13:13,125 --> 01:13:16,744
This is the day,
this is the day

1069
01:13:16,779 --> 01:13:19,647
That the Lord
has made

1070
01:13:19,682 --> 01:13:22,516
That the Lord
has made

1071
01:13:22,551 --> 01:13:24,452
That the Lord
has made

1072
01:13:24,487 --> 01:13:27,853
We will rejoice

1073
01:13:27,888 --> 01:13:29,924
We will rejoice
and be glad in it

1074
01:13:29,959 --> 01:13:31,810
And be glad
in it

1075
01:13:31,845 --> 01:13:33,626
This is the day

1076
01:13:33,661 --> 01:13:37,661
That the Lord
has made

1077
01:13:37,965 --> 01:13:41,965
We will rejoice
and be glad in it

1078
01:13:55,501 --> 01:13:59,501
This is the day,
this is the day

1079
01:14:13,002 --> 01:14:16,960
That the Lord
has made

1080
01:14:22,142 --> 01:14:23,844
Shit. It's nearly
on empty.

1081
01:14:23,879 --> 01:14:25,544
I've got money.

1082
01:14:25,579 --> 01:14:27,864
Forget the money.
It's just no good.

1083
01:14:27,899 --> 01:14:29,825
We've been driving
around for hours.

1084
01:14:29,860 --> 01:14:31,752
When was the last time
you phoned home?

1085
01:14:31,787 --> 01:14:33,886
Uh, about 9:00.

1086
01:14:33,921 --> 01:14:35,890
Jeez.
It's nearly 11:00.

1087
01:14:35,925 --> 01:14:39,925
I've got those

1088
01:14:41,996 --> 01:14:45,989
Lonely, Ionely, Ionely,
Ionely blues

1089
01:14:47,134 --> 01:14:51,127
Lonely, Ionely, Ionely,
Ionely blues

1090
01:14:51,162 --> 01:14:54,807
I've got those

1091
01:14:54,842 --> 01:14:58,835
Lonely, Ionely, Ionely,
Ionely blues

1092
01:15:00,080 --> 01:15:04,073
Lonely, Ionely blues

1093
01:15:04,084 --> 01:15:05,819
Look what she done,
what she done, my baby

1094
01:15:05,854 --> 01:15:07,354
Bring your ass
in here, girl!

1095
01:15:07,389 --> 01:15:11,389
Look what she done...

1096
01:15:13,273 --> 01:15:16,052
I said in here!
Move!

1097
01:15:16,087 --> 01:15:18,797
Your mother's
been out

1098
01:15:18,832 --> 01:15:20,534
all day, half
the fucking night!

1099
01:15:20,569 --> 01:15:22,203
Now, where the fuck
you been?

1100
01:15:22,238 --> 01:15:23,837
Come on, bro,
she's home now.

1101
01:15:23,872 --> 01:15:26,640
Let the kid
go to bed.

1102
01:15:26,675 --> 01:15:28,941
Come on, Jake.

1103
01:15:28,976 --> 01:15:31,295
Play the guitar, man.

1104
01:15:31,330 --> 01:15:33,579
Go on.
Piss off to bed.

1105
01:15:33,614 --> 01:15:36,250
Hey, come on, give
your Uncle Bully

1106
01:15:36,285 --> 01:15:38,303
a kiss good night.

1107
01:15:38,338 --> 01:15:40,286
I don't want to.

1108
01:15:40,321 --> 01:15:41,722
What? I didn't
hear you.

1109
01:15:41,757 --> 01:15:43,088
I said I don't want to.

1110
01:15:43,123 --> 01:15:47,123
What, you got
a hearing problem, girl?

1111
01:15:47,196 --> 01:15:51,154
Hey, no. Leave it.

1112
01:15:51,189 --> 01:15:51,748
Daddy, no!

1113
01:15:51,783 --> 01:15:52,731
Daddy!

1114
01:15:52,766 --> 01:15:54,017
I told you
about this thing, eh?

1115
01:15:54,052 --> 01:15:55,269
No fucking wonder
you don't do

1116
01:15:55,304 --> 01:15:56,904
what you're
fucking told!

1117
01:15:56,939 --> 01:16:00,939
Take it easy, Jake.

1118
01:16:01,689 --> 01:16:05,689
She's just a kid.

1119
01:16:09,683 --> 01:16:11,468
Go on.
Get out of here.

1120
01:16:11,503 --> 01:16:13,253
Bully,
play us a song.

1121
01:16:13,288 --> 01:16:17,022
Go on, dude.

1122
01:16:17,057 --> 01:16:21,057
Look what she done,
what she done, my baby

1123
01:16:28,053 --> 01:16:32,053
Look what she done,
what she done, my baby

1124
01:16:39,014 --> 01:16:41,065
Look what she done...

1125
01:16:41,100 --> 01:16:43,117
Stop your panic,
woman.

1126
01:16:43,152 --> 01:16:45,084
She's home.

1127
01:16:45,119 --> 01:16:46,286
She won't be
taking off anymore.

1128
01:16:46,321 --> 01:16:50,321
Where is she, Jake?

1129
01:16:53,894 --> 01:16:57,887
She pissed off
out the back.

1130
01:16:57,922 --> 01:17:01,364
What the fuck?

1131
01:17:03,566 --> 01:17:07,566
Aah! Aah! Oh! Oh!

1132
01:17:10,444 --> 01:17:14,437
Some-someone help me
get her down!

1133
01:17:16,717 --> 01:17:18,817
Please! Please!

1134
01:17:18,852 --> 01:17:20,988
Come on, baby.
Come on, girl.

1135
01:17:21,023 --> 01:17:24,123
It's all right,
baby.

1136
01:17:24,158 --> 01:17:28,158
Mummy's home.
Mummy's home.

1137
01:17:29,859 --> 01:17:33,859
Come on, Grace.
Oh, God.

1138
01:17:36,336 --> 01:17:40,329
We've got to
do something.

1139
01:17:43,477 --> 01:17:47,470
My baby!

1140
01:17:58,358 --> 01:18:02,351
I'll get help.

1141
01:18:54,148 --> 01:18:56,548
No, Grace!

1142
01:18:56,583 --> 01:19:00,583
Don't cry, Mavis.

1143
01:19:16,466 --> 01:19:20,466
Doesn't do any good.

1144
01:19:36,314 --> 01:19:40,314
Auntie Matawai?

1145
01:19:42,030 --> 01:19:45,988
It's Beth.

1146
01:19:47,434 --> 01:19:51,427
Ka mata oku
tamahine...

1147
01:19:53,574 --> 01:19:57,567
last night.

1148
01:19:59,580 --> 01:20:03,573
I want to bring her
home, Auntie.

1149
01:20:04,451 --> 01:20:08,444
Will you come
and get us, please?

1150
01:20:10,023 --> 01:20:11,456
Thank you.

1151
01:20:11,491 --> 01:20:13,160
We're going to
play spacies.

1152
01:20:13,195 --> 01:20:14,879
Come on, you two.

1153
01:20:14,914 --> 01:20:16,528
Oh, where's Gracie?

1154
01:20:16,563 --> 01:20:18,096
She's having
a long sleep.

1155
01:20:18,131 --> 01:20:22,131
No, she's not.
Her bed's empty.

1156
01:20:23,683 --> 01:20:27,683
That's enough, Polly.
Come on.

1157
01:20:30,911 --> 01:20:33,213
What the fuck's
going on here?

1158
01:20:33,248 --> 01:20:35,515
I want us to take
Grace back home

1159
01:20:35,550 --> 01:20:38,550
to the Marae.

1160
01:20:38,585 --> 01:20:40,387
This is
her fucking home.

1161
01:20:40,422 --> 01:20:42,554
No, it's not.

1162
01:20:42,589 --> 01:20:44,424
This was
never her home...

1163
01:20:44,459 --> 01:20:47,159
never.

1164
01:20:47,194 --> 01:20:49,328
And that
fucking place is?

1165
01:20:49,363 --> 01:20:52,232
Fucking Maoris
who think they're better

1166
01:20:52,267 --> 01:20:55,469
than the rest of us?

1167
01:20:55,504 --> 01:20:58,337
I hate them.

1168
01:20:58,372 --> 01:21:01,008
Bastards living
in the fucking past.

1169
01:21:01,043 --> 01:21:02,507
It's our past, too, Jake.

1170
01:21:02,542 --> 01:21:06,311
What's that
supposed to mean?

1171
01:21:06,346 --> 01:21:10,315
I want Grace to be
with her people.

1172
01:21:10,350 --> 01:21:11,919
We should have gone back
a long time ago.

1173
01:21:11,954 --> 01:21:13,318
Fuck off!

1174
01:21:13,353 --> 01:21:16,622
You're not
taking her anywhere.

1175
01:21:16,657 --> 01:21:20,027
I'm taking her, Jake,
with or without you.

1176
01:21:20,062 --> 01:21:21,728
I wasn't there
when Grace needed me.

1177
01:21:21,763 --> 01:21:23,614
This time
I'm going to do

1178
01:21:23,649 --> 01:21:25,430
the right thing
by her,

1179
01:21:25,465 --> 01:21:27,067
and you're not
going to stop me.

1180
01:21:27,102 --> 01:21:28,533
You fucking do,

1181
01:21:28,568 --> 01:21:30,170
and I won't be here
when you get back.

1182
01:21:30,205 --> 01:21:33,272
Well, go on, then.

1183
01:21:33,307 --> 01:21:35,442
Go! Get the hell
out of here!

1184
01:21:35,477 --> 01:21:38,710
I'm taking her.

1185
01:21:38,745 --> 01:21:42,745
I'll kill you first!

1186
01:21:43,145 --> 01:21:47,085
Well, go on. Do it.

1187
01:21:47,120 --> 01:21:50,190
You're still
a slave, Jake...

1188
01:21:50,225 --> 01:21:53,260
to your fists,
to the drink,

1189
01:21:53,295 --> 01:21:57,295
to yourself.

1190
01:22:00,202 --> 01:22:04,202
Well, go on.

1191
01:22:07,040 --> 01:22:11,033
Kill the bloody
lot of us!

1192
01:22:11,278 --> 01:22:15,271
Stay out of
my fucking way...

1193
01:22:25,759 --> 01:22:29,752
or I'll kill you.

1194
01:23:33,193 --> 01:23:37,186
You've come home, Grace.
We're home.

1195
01:23:43,136 --> 01:23:45,270
Oh, my baby.

1196
01:23:45,305 --> 01:23:46,773
Am I that much
of a bastard, eh?

1197
01:23:46,808 --> 01:23:48,241
You're my mates.
You tell me.

1198
01:23:48,276 --> 01:23:49,641
It's not too late

1199
01:23:49,676 --> 01:23:50,811
if you want to go
to the Tangi.

1200
01:23:50,846 --> 01:23:52,646
We'll drive you.

1201
01:23:52,681 --> 01:23:55,580
Fuck off.

1202
01:23:55,615 --> 01:23:57,851
I'm not going to give them
the satisfaction.

1203
01:23:57,886 --> 01:24:00,854
I was never fucking
good enough,

1204
01:24:00,889 --> 01:24:02,821
not for their Beth.

1205
01:24:02,856 --> 01:24:06,259
I'll knock her
bloody head in.

1206
01:24:06,294 --> 01:24:08,326
Never mind, bro.

1207
01:24:08,361 --> 01:24:10,595
What's the key
to her, man?

1208
01:24:10,630 --> 01:24:13,865
You think I was
tough on the kid?

1209
01:24:13,900 --> 01:24:15,769
It wouldn't have been
just that, mate.

1210
01:24:15,804 --> 01:24:18,203
Bull, what do you think?

1211
01:24:18,238 --> 01:24:20,373
You think I was
tough on her?

1212
01:24:20,408 --> 01:24:24,408
Fucked if I know, bro.

1213
01:24:25,312 --> 01:24:29,305
I'll try and tell you
a story, eh, Gracie?

1214
01:24:29,340 --> 01:24:33,340
The story about a young girl

1215
01:24:33,587 --> 01:24:37,580
growing up
in this beautiful place.

1216
01:24:37,615 --> 01:24:39,891
She was given an honor.

1217
01:24:39,926 --> 01:24:43,497
She was made
Puhi of the Marae.

1218
01:24:43,532 --> 01:24:47,532
The special one.

1219
01:24:48,635 --> 01:24:52,628
Well, you see,
the girl fell in love,

1220
01:24:54,341 --> 01:24:57,742
as all young people do.

1221
01:24:57,777 --> 01:25:01,777
But you see,
the problem was...

1222
01:25:02,582 --> 01:25:06,575
the old people
wouldn't agree to the fella.

1223
01:25:06,610 --> 01:25:10,610
The girl, being headstrong,

1224
01:25:11,393 --> 01:25:14,860
went with him anyway.

1225
01:25:14,895 --> 01:25:18,895
Her father said
she'd be back...

1226
01:25:19,699 --> 01:25:23,692
that when everything
went to hell, she'd be back.

1227
01:25:24,804 --> 01:25:28,797
So the girl...
made a promise to herself

1228
01:25:28,832 --> 01:25:32,832
and said she wouldn't.

1229
01:25:33,480 --> 01:25:37,473
No matter what,
she wouldn't.

1230
01:25:37,508 --> 01:25:39,618
You see, Grace...

1231
01:25:39,653 --> 01:25:43,653
I did know
how to keep a promise.

1232
01:25:44,326 --> 01:25:46,324
I did.

1233
01:25:46,359 --> 01:25:48,828
I'm so sorry, Bub.

1234
01:25:48,863 --> 01:25:52,863
I'm so sorry.

1235
01:25:56,002 --> 01:25:59,995
I should have been
there for you, sis.

1236
01:26:01,875 --> 01:26:05,868
You were always
there for us.

1237
01:26:23,763 --> 01:26:25,765
Oh, son.

1238
01:26:25,800 --> 01:26:27,732
Hey, G.

1239
01:26:27,767 --> 01:26:31,767
Best friends...
forever.

1240
01:26:37,012 --> 01:26:40,512
Remember?

1241
01:26:40,547 --> 01:26:41,948
That's all I meant.
Honest.

1242
01:26:41,983 --> 01:26:45,519
But you were right.

1243
01:26:45,554 --> 01:26:49,020
I'm just a stupid kid

1244
01:26:49,055 --> 01:26:53,048
who lives in an old
wreck of a car.

1245
01:26:53,083 --> 01:26:55,328
She loved you, man.

1246
01:26:55,363 --> 01:26:57,915
She loved you.

1247
01:26:57,950 --> 01:27:00,432
What's the time?

1248
01:27:00,467 --> 01:27:02,834
What's the time,
Mr. Wolf?

1249
01:27:02,869 --> 01:27:05,572
What's the time?
Say, it's 1:00

1250
01:27:05,607 --> 01:27:07,441
Have you ever seen
so much piss?

1251
01:27:07,476 --> 01:27:09,276
That's because
they love you, man.

1252
01:27:09,311 --> 01:27:11,977
Yeah.

1253
01:27:12,012 --> 01:27:15,714
Yeah. Why not?

1254
01:27:15,749 --> 01:27:17,917
I'm a lovable chap.

1255
01:27:17,952 --> 01:27:20,518
Jake the Muss.

1256
01:27:20,553 --> 01:27:22,756
What's the time,
Mr. Wolf?

1257
01:27:22,791 --> 01:27:24,256
Ohh ohh

1258
01:27:24,291 --> 01:27:27,027
There's Mr. Daddy-Longlegs

1259
01:27:27,062 --> 01:27:29,728
Crawling onto the ceiling

1260
01:27:29,763 --> 01:27:33,763
The sun don't shine,
the sun don't shine

1261
01:27:53,822 --> 01:27:57,780
The sun don't shine...

1262
01:28:36,463 --> 01:28:40,456
Where the fuck are you?!

1263
01:28:40,491 --> 01:28:44,491
You bastard!

1264
01:29:16,995 --> 01:29:20,995
Fucking bastard.

1265
01:29:52,505 --> 01:29:55,039
Don't forget your hat,
eh, uncle?

1266
01:29:55,074 --> 01:29:56,509
Hey, uncle, did you
get all the ghosts?

1267
01:29:56,544 --> 01:30:00,544
I sure did.

1268
01:30:19,566 --> 01:30:22,401
Got the whole
lot of them.

1269
01:30:22,436 --> 01:30:25,236
Bring the kids with you.

1270
01:30:25,271 --> 01:30:27,073
We've got a lot of work
to do back home.

1271
01:30:27,108 --> 01:30:31,108
And here, too, auntie.

1272
01:30:35,929 --> 01:30:39,929
You sort out here first.

1273
01:30:46,025 --> 01:30:50,018
Be strong.

1274
01:30:59,873 --> 01:31:03,241
Good-bye, auntie.

1275
01:31:03,276 --> 01:31:06,611
You made me
real proud today, son.

1276
01:31:06,646 --> 01:31:10,646
Me, too, eh, Mum?
I made you proud today.

1277
01:31:11,219 --> 01:31:13,718
You sure did, Bub.

1278
01:31:13,753 --> 01:31:16,890
Well, I suppose I'd better
be taking off, then.

1279
01:31:16,925 --> 01:31:19,757
Take off?
Where to?

1280
01:31:19,792 --> 01:31:21,227
Probably back to my car.
I like it there.

1281
01:31:21,262 --> 01:31:23,628
Well, do you think

1282
01:31:23,663 --> 01:31:26,566
you could like it here,
with us?

1283
01:31:26,601 --> 01:31:30,601
Because we like having you.

1284
01:31:30,838 --> 01:31:32,837
Don't we, kids?

1285
01:31:32,872 --> 01:31:35,974
Well, whatever
you say, Mrs. H.

1286
01:31:36,009 --> 01:31:37,944
I mean, if you need me,
that'll be great.

1287
01:31:37,979 --> 01:31:41,979
I do need you.

1288
01:31:46,533 --> 01:31:50,533
Need you all.

1289
01:31:58,197 --> 01:32:02,197
Well, we'll say grace.

1290
01:32:08,843 --> 01:32:10,308
Grace!

1291
01:32:10,343 --> 01:32:14,343
Thank you for my family,

1292
01:32:23,756 --> 01:32:27,749
thank you for the food.
Amen.

1293
01:32:27,784 --> 01:32:28,360
Good look, bro.

1294
01:32:28,361 --> 01:32:32,361
Would you like one, bro?

1295
01:32:42,041 --> 01:32:46,034
No, thanks, man.
I wear mine on the inside.

1296
01:32:46,069 --> 01:32:49,378
you should take
the car back, son?

1297
01:32:49,450 --> 01:32:53,408
In the morning.

1298
01:32:55,722 --> 01:32:59,290
Your mates did you
proud today.

1299
01:32:59,325 --> 01:33:01,027
Mrs. H, could you read me
one of G's stories?

1300
01:33:01,062 --> 01:33:02,362
I can't.
That's why she reads to me.

1301
01:33:02,397 --> 01:33:04,329
I mean used to.

1302
01:33:04,364 --> 01:33:08,364
Yeah, the one
about the Taniwha.

1303
01:33:42,303 --> 01:33:46,261
OK.

1304
01:33:46,472 --> 01:33:49,040
What's wrong, Mum?

1305
01:33:49,075 --> 01:33:53,075
Toot, put the kids
in the car.

1306
01:33:58,286 --> 01:34:01,019
Thanks, bro.

1307
01:34:01,054 --> 01:34:04,322
Anyway, this fucking ape
comes over to me,

1308
01:34:04,357 --> 01:34:06,959
takes off his shades,
and says the classic line.

1309
01:34:06,994 --> 01:34:09,229
The classic line!
Wait for it.

1310
01:34:09,264 --> 01:34:11,429
Waiting,
waiting, waiting.

1311
01:34:11,464 --> 01:34:14,500
"What the fuck
you staring at, man?"

1312
01:34:14,535 --> 01:34:17,869
So I say to him, cool-ass,

1313
01:34:17,904 --> 01:34:20,573
"Well, not you, mate.
Your spunky missis."

1314
01:34:20,608 --> 01:34:23,242
Trouble is, she was
fucking uglier than him.

1315
01:34:23,277 --> 01:34:26,479
Then all hell
broke loose.

1316
01:34:26,514 --> 01:34:29,714
Old Jimmy, eh?

1317
01:34:29,749 --> 01:34:33,152
Hey, you can stay at
my place tonight, mate.

1318
01:34:33,187 --> 01:34:37,187
Yeah, fuck it.
Why not?

1319
01:34:38,157 --> 01:34:42,150
Beth! Bully, give
the lady a seat.

1320
01:34:42,185 --> 01:34:42,185
You fucking animal.

1321
01:34:42,220 --> 01:34:44,762
What the fuck?

1322
01:34:44,797 --> 01:34:46,816
Women and children, eh?
You fucking coward!

1323
01:34:46,851 --> 01:34:48,835
Please, control your
missis there, mate.

1324
01:34:48,870 --> 01:34:51,502
Who the fuck
do you think you are

1325
01:34:51,537 --> 01:34:52,538
coming in here
mouthing off at my mates?

1326
01:34:52,573 --> 01:34:54,207
Get the fucking hell
out of here

1327
01:34:54,242 --> 01:34:55,792
before I kick
your bloody head in.

1328
01:34:55,827 --> 01:34:57,343
That's always your
answer, eh, Jake?

1329
01:34:57,378 --> 01:34:59,444
Violence.

1330
01:34:59,479 --> 01:35:01,080
It's bad enough
that you did it here,

1331
01:35:01,115 --> 01:35:03,015
but you brought it
home with you

1332
01:35:03,050 --> 01:35:05,883
and I damn well let you.

1333
01:35:05,918 --> 01:35:07,586
What the fuck
are you on about now?

1334
01:35:07,621 --> 01:35:09,005
It was violence
that killed my Grace.

1335
01:35:09,040 --> 01:35:10,389
She didn't have
an ounce of violence

1336
01:35:10,424 --> 01:35:12,356
in her, Jake,

1337
01:35:12,391 --> 01:35:14,260
but we made damn sure
it was all around her.

1338
01:35:14,295 --> 01:35:15,829
She killed herself!

1339
01:35:15,864 --> 01:35:17,328
You bloody bastard!

1340
01:35:17,363 --> 01:35:19,598
It was your
bloody mate

1341
01:35:19,633 --> 01:35:21,799
who handed her the rope!

1342
01:35:21,834 --> 01:35:22,835
Hey, I don't have a clue
what you're on about.

1343
01:35:22,870 --> 01:35:24,771
You fucking child...

1344
01:35:24,806 --> 01:35:26,857
Shut up, Nig!

1345
01:35:26,892 --> 01:35:28,873
You animal.

1346
01:35:28,908 --> 01:35:30,374
You raped
a 13-year-old girl,

1347
01:35:30,409 --> 01:35:32,879
then sat here drinking
with her father

1348
01:35:32,914 --> 01:35:34,531
while the rest
of us buried her.

1349
01:35:34,566 --> 01:35:36,149
She's off
her fucking head, man.

1350
01:35:36,184 --> 01:35:37,849
Sneaking around my house

1351
01:35:37,884 --> 01:35:39,986
and laying
your dirty, filthy,

1352
01:35:40,021 --> 01:35:41,988
fucking hands on my baby!

1353
01:35:42,023 --> 01:35:43,955
My Grace!

1354
01:35:43,990 --> 01:35:45,823
Hey, you're not
on the fucking Marae now,

1355
01:35:45,858 --> 01:35:47,260
so don't come in here
accusing my mates of shit!

1356
01:35:47,295 --> 01:35:49,427
Hey, come on, man.

1357
01:35:49,462 --> 01:35:51,998
Look, no one's
thinking straight.

1358
01:35:52,033 --> 01:35:55,366
We're family. Right?

1359
01:35:55,401 --> 01:35:59,401
Beth. Sit down.
Have a drink.

1360
01:36:02,475 --> 01:36:06,468
I won't drink with
you fucking animals!

1361
01:36:21,427 --> 01:36:25,420
Read it.

1362
01:36:31,604 --> 01:36:35,597
Uncle Bully.

1363
01:37:13,479 --> 01:37:17,472
Uncle fucking Bully!

1364
01:37:19,118 --> 01:37:23,111
Let's go, son.

1365
01:37:32,498 --> 01:37:36,491
You dumb bastard, Bully!

1366
01:37:42,642 --> 01:37:46,635
Fuck you, Beth.
Where are you going?

1367
01:37:46,670 --> 01:37:47,475
I found something
better, Jake,

1368
01:37:47,510 --> 01:37:48,310
and I'm going to
make damn sure

1369
01:37:48,316 --> 01:37:49,582
my kids have it all.

1370
01:37:49,617 --> 01:37:52,984
From now on,

1371
01:37:53,019 --> 01:37:55,955
I make the decisions
for my family.

1372
01:37:55,990 --> 01:37:57,388
Fuck off, then!

1373
01:37:57,423 --> 01:38:01,026
You'll get nothing
from me.

1374
01:38:01,061 --> 01:38:04,013
You've got
nothing I want.

1375
01:38:04,048 --> 01:38:06,966
Our people
once were warriors,

1376
01:38:07,001 --> 01:38:10,668
but not like you, Jake.

1377
01:38:10,703 --> 01:38:14,206
They were a people
with mana, pride.

1378
01:38:14,241 --> 01:38:15,706
People with spirit.

1379
01:38:15,741 --> 01:38:17,541
If my spirit
can survive

1380
01:38:17,576 --> 01:38:21,576
living with you
for 18 years,

1381
01:38:22,316 --> 01:38:26,316
then I can survive
anything.

1382
01:38:26,682 --> 01:38:30,354
Maybe you
taught me that.

1383
01:38:30,389 --> 01:38:32,623
Oh, you are fucked, lady!
Really fucked!

1384
01:38:32,658 --> 01:38:35,394
You think I need you
and your fucking spirit?

1385
01:38:35,429 --> 01:38:38,448
Fuck off! Go on, go!

1386
01:38:38,483 --> 01:38:41,432
I don't want you, ever!

1387
01:38:41,467 --> 01:38:43,402
I'll knock
your fucking head off!

1388
01:38:43,437 --> 01:38:45,572
Fuck you! You'll be back.

1389
01:38:45,607 --> 01:38:47,707
Fuck this warrior shit.

1390
01:38:47,742 --> 01:38:50,544
You'll be back!

1391
01:38:50,579 --> 01:38:53,311
Fuck you, Beth!

1392
01:38:53,346 --> 01:38:57,339
Do you hear me, Beth?!

1393
01:38:58,117 --> 01:39:01,319
Fuck you!

1394
01:39:01,354 --> 01:39:05,057
Where are we going, Mum?

1395
01:39:05,092 --> 01:39:08,759
We're going home.

1396
01:39:08,794 --> 01:39:12,081
Oh, fuck all that
fucking warrior shit!

1397
01:39:12,116 --> 01:39:15,093
You'll be back!
You'll fucking see.

1398
01:39:15,128 --> 01:39:18,070
You'll need me!
You'll fucking want me!

1399
01:39:18,105 --> 01:39:22,105
You'll be back.
Fuck you, Beth!

1400
01:39:41,662 --> 01:39:45,620
Beth, fuck you! Beth!
