1
00:01:28,663 --> 00:01:30,927
Hey, Dr. Nichols, I was just
coming down to say good-bye.

2
00:01:30,999 --> 00:01:33,058
Anthony, I came to help you
with your bags.

3
00:01:33,134 --> 00:01:36,399
That's okay. I can take 'em
down myself. I got 'em.

4
00:01:36,471 --> 00:01:38,439
What's... What's this?

5
00:01:38,506 --> 00:01:40,974
What's going on?

6
00:01:44,312 --> 00:01:48,112
Well, see, my friend Dignan didn't
realize this was a voluntary hospital...

7
00:01:48,182 --> 00:01:51,413
and he got this whole
escape thing worked out.

8
00:01:51,486 --> 00:01:53,750
He just got
so excited about the thing...

9
00:01:53,821 --> 00:01:56,813
I didn't have the heart
to tell him...

10
00:01:56,891 --> 00:01:59,416
no, that...

11
00:02:04,699 --> 00:02:06,633
Look how excited he is.

12
00:02:11,239 --> 00:02:14,402
I gotta do it this way, Dr. Nichols.
I gotta climb out.

13
00:02:14,475 --> 00:02:17,239
It's only one floor down.

14
00:02:17,311 --> 00:02:19,905
Okay. But can you do it fast?

15
00:02:19,981 --> 00:02:24,680
You know, this doesn't look good.
None of this looks good at all.

16
00:02:24,752 --> 00:02:27,448
Well, thanks very much, Dr. Nichols.

17
00:02:27,522 --> 00:02:31,117
You've really been a great help.
You've been a great doctor.

18
00:02:31,192 --> 00:02:33,717
Well, thank you.

19
00:02:35,363 --> 00:02:37,297
Can you hand me my bag, please?

20
00:02:41,035 --> 00:02:43,299
See ya.

21
00:02:43,371 --> 00:02:46,306
Hey, Anthony, don't try
to save everybody, okay?

22
00:02:46,374 --> 00:02:48,342
Okay, I won't.

23
00:02:51,179 --> 00:02:52,737
Dennis!

24
00:02:56,184 --> 00:02:58,778
- See ya later, Felicia.
- Hey, Anthony. Thanks for everything.

25
00:02:58,853 --> 00:03:01,287
- Good-bye. Take care.
- Bye, Barbara.

26
00:03:01,355 --> 00:03:03,789
- See ya, Chris.
- Thanks, Anthony.

27
00:03:03,858 --> 00:03:07,385
Come on. Any problems?
Yes! Wonderful.

28
00:03:07,462 --> 00:03:09,657
Wait, wait.
Who'd you get to do that?

29
00:03:09,731 --> 00:03:12,598
Did you bribe the janitor?
Smart.

30
00:03:21,743 --> 00:03:23,677
- Driver, what's our E.T.A.?
- 7:30.

31
00:03:23,745 --> 00:03:26,543
Good. We're on schedule. Here's
our agenda for the next few months.

32
00:03:26,614 --> 00:03:29,674
- You'll find everything is in order.
- Practice job. Looks good.

33
00:03:29,751 --> 00:03:33,380
That's our first move when we get back.
Look it over. I'll brief you on the way.

34
00:03:33,454 --> 00:03:37,584
This is what I was trying to do.

35
00:03:37,658 --> 00:03:39,649
The practice job, a heist.

36
00:03:39,727 --> 00:03:41,922
You and I both respond to goals.

37
00:03:41,996 --> 00:03:44,123
- It all leads to Mr. Henry.
- The guy from the letters.

38
00:03:44,198 --> 00:03:46,598
Exactly. This is rough.

39
00:03:46,667 --> 00:03:49,329
You and I respond to structure...

40
00:03:49,403 --> 00:03:52,201
and that's what's important.

41
00:03:52,273 --> 00:03:54,264
"The next 50."

42
00:03:56,544 --> 00:04:00,139
So, did you enjoy your first
visit to the nuthouse?

43
00:04:00,214 --> 00:04:03,206
Come on. Be sensitive to the fact
that other people...

44
00:04:03,284 --> 00:04:06,617
are not comfortable talking
about emotional disturbances.

45
00:04:08,122 --> 00:04:11,057
You know I am. I'm fine with that.
But other people...

46
00:04:11,125 --> 00:04:13,491
Put it behind you.
You're out. You're better.

47
00:04:13,561 --> 00:04:16,530
- You're right.
- And so it begins.

48
00:04:16,597 --> 00:04:20,158
Now, we should also get on a fitness
regime... sit-ups, hitting the bags...

49
00:04:20,234 --> 00:04:22,759
I was running ten miles a day
when I was in the desert.

50
00:04:22,837 --> 00:04:26,898
Were you really?
That's good cardiovascular.

51
00:04:26,974 --> 00:04:29,807
When did you get so avid
about the fitness thing, Dignan?

52
00:04:29,877 --> 00:04:33,142
What? What do you mean by avid?

53
00:04:33,214 --> 00:04:35,978
I've never known you
to be all that athletic.

54
00:04:36,050 --> 00:04:38,211
You've never known me
to be all that athletic?

55
00:04:38,286 --> 00:04:41,187
- Does it sound weird?
- Not that you're not a good athlete.

56
00:04:41,255 --> 00:04:44,656
- Does it sound weird to talk about it?
- It doesn't sound weird.

57
00:04:44,725 --> 00:04:48,058
I'm not saying it's the top priority,
but I think it's a good goal.

58
00:04:48,129 --> 00:04:51,394
- I think it's a really good goal.
- Here, put these on.

59
00:05:37,945 --> 00:05:40,573
- Obviously, good quickness.
- Yeah, in and out pretty fast.

60
00:05:40,648 --> 00:05:42,946
- Real fast, and good intensity.
- High intensity.

61
00:05:43,017 --> 00:05:45,247
Great, 'cause
I was like really fast.

62
00:05:45,319 --> 00:05:48,152
The preparation was good.
I think that's your specialty.

63
00:05:48,222 --> 00:05:51,988
If I said that, it would sound
like bragging. Okay, criticisms.

64
00:05:52,059 --> 00:05:55,085
- Criticisms.
- I've only one: not very thorough.

65
00:05:55,162 --> 00:05:57,858
- Left a lot of valuables.
- I don't think that was a mistake.

66
00:05:57,932 --> 00:06:01,424
That was one of the limitations
of this job.

67
00:06:01,502 --> 00:06:03,766
By the way, great job in there.

68
00:06:03,838 --> 00:06:06,705
- It was nice working with you, 'cause...
- Thank you.

69
00:06:08,743 --> 00:06:10,734
Next order of business: Mr. Henry.

70
00:06:10,811 --> 00:06:14,440
You're probably wondering when
I'm going to introduce you to Mr. Henry.

71
00:06:14,515 --> 00:06:18,007
In answer to that question, very soon.
In fact, judging from how well that...

72
00:06:18,085 --> 00:06:20,076
Here you go.
You gotta do that.

73
00:06:20,154 --> 00:06:22,452
Judging from how well
that job went today...

74
00:06:22,523 --> 00:06:24,320
including the coins and earrings...

75
00:06:24,392 --> 00:06:26,383
was, to say the least...

76
00:06:28,729 --> 00:06:31,926
You took the earrings, Dignan?
You took 'em?

77
00:06:34,936 --> 00:06:39,066
Well, it's my fault. Ultimately,
Anthony, when are you gonna learn?

78
00:06:39,140 --> 00:06:42,701
Man, you got another ball!
Should I play your game?

79
00:06:42,777 --> 00:06:45,769
I know you remember the list,
'cause you signed it.

80
00:06:45,846 --> 00:06:48,610
"The things Dignan's
not supposed to touch."

81
00:06:48,683 --> 00:06:51,914
I can't be sorting through all that shit
in the middle of a burglary.

82
00:06:51,986 --> 00:06:55,945
Hey, I don't care, okay? I bought
the earrings for my mother's birthday.

83
00:06:56,023 --> 00:06:58,116
I went down,
I picked 'em out myself.

84
00:06:58,192 --> 00:07:01,423
Hey, one thing is, every valuable item
in the house was on that list.

85
00:07:01,495 --> 00:07:04,055
Maybe we should've robbed your house.
Did you ever think of that?

86
00:07:04,131 --> 00:07:06,622
I bet that never crossed your mind.

87
00:07:07,702 --> 00:07:11,103
What? What? Come on, Dignan!

88
00:07:11,172 --> 00:07:13,106
You know there's nothing
to steal from my mom and Craig.

89
00:07:27,822 --> 00:07:29,551
Hey, Grace!

90
00:07:34,962 --> 00:07:37,021
You're supposed to be in Arizona.

91
00:07:37,098 --> 00:07:39,293
What, you don't say hi anymore?
Come on.

92
00:07:39,367 --> 00:07:41,597
Is this the...
Are you the pilot?

93
00:07:41,669 --> 00:07:44,433
No, I'm Anthony.
I'm Grace's brother.

94
00:07:44,505 --> 00:07:47,235
Will you excuse us
for a minute, Bernice?

95
00:07:47,308 --> 00:07:49,640
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

96
00:07:52,980 --> 00:07:54,914
You told her...

97
00:07:54,982 --> 00:07:57,974
You told your friend Bernice
I'm some kind of jet pilot?

98
00:07:58,052 --> 00:08:01,579
What was I supposed to say,
they stuck you in an insane asylum?

99
00:08:01,655 --> 00:08:05,989
It wasn't an insane asylum, Grace.
I explained it was for exhaustion.

100
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:07,857
Exhaustion?

101
00:08:07,928 --> 00:08:09,623
Yes, exhaustion.

102
00:08:09,697 --> 00:08:13,827
You haven't worked a day in your life.
How could you be exhausted?

103
00:08:13,901 --> 00:08:16,028
Okay, sit down. Okay?

104
00:08:16,103 --> 00:08:20,039
I didn't come up here today
to argue with you, okay?

105
00:08:22,009 --> 00:08:25,945
- I got some friends waiting for me...
- Who?

106
00:08:27,081 --> 00:08:29,208
- Some associates.
- Dignan?

107
00:08:30,451 --> 00:08:33,318
Yeah, Dignan, but also...

108
00:08:34,221 --> 00:08:37,054
What's wrong with Dignan, Grace?
I thought you liked Dignan.

109
00:08:37,124 --> 00:08:40,025
- I do like Dignan.
- Then why did you sigh?

110
00:08:40,094 --> 00:08:41,618
But he's a liar.

111
00:08:41,695 --> 00:08:41,729
Bob Mapplethorpe,
potential getaway driver, go!

112
00:08:41,729 --> 00:08:44,391
Bob Mapplethorpe,
potential getaway driver, go!

113
00:08:45,299 --> 00:08:47,859
- Go.
- There's an air of mystery about me.

114
00:08:47,935 --> 00:08:51,200
Don't complicate it. Your strength is
you have a car you can provide.

115
00:08:51,272 --> 00:08:54,571
Sell yourself. Start over.
You ready? Go.

116
00:08:54,642 --> 00:08:57,406
Okay. All right.
I'm a risk taker.

117
00:08:57,478 --> 00:09:01,175
I'm growin' an entire crop of marijuana
plants in my parents' back yard.

118
00:09:01,248 --> 00:09:04,740
Wait a second. You're growing an entire
crop of marijuana in your back yard?

119
00:09:04,819 --> 00:09:08,050
Dignan, look. I'm just not that good
at this selling yourself stuff, okay?

120
00:09:08,122 --> 00:09:10,420
So I'm just
gonna tell you the truth.

121
00:09:10,491 --> 00:09:13,153
I really want to be
a part of this team...

122
00:09:13,227 --> 00:09:16,162
and I'm the only one
with a car.

123
00:09:17,398 --> 00:09:19,059
That's good.

124
00:09:20,234 --> 00:09:22,429
'Cause that hits me right here.

125
00:09:22,503 --> 00:09:26,166
Okay, can you do me a favor
and take...

126
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:30,643
I want you to take these earrings
and put them in Mom's mahogany box.

127
00:09:30,711 --> 00:09:34,738
- Put them in your backpack.
- What are you doing with these?

128
00:09:34,815 --> 00:09:37,181
Could you just put them
in the box, please, Grace?

129
00:09:37,251 --> 00:09:41,950
You've really gotten into the bad habit
of asking a huge amount of questions.

130
00:09:44,358 --> 00:09:45,791
God.

131
00:09:47,228 --> 00:09:48,957
I gotta go, okay, pal?

132
00:09:49,029 --> 00:09:51,327
What's gonna happen to you, Anthony?

133
00:09:51,398 --> 00:09:55,300
Geez, Grace, what the hell
kind of question is that to ask me?

134
00:09:55,369 --> 00:09:57,303
When are you coming home?

135
00:10:01,242 --> 00:10:05,269
Grace, I can't come home.
I'm an adult.

136
00:10:08,182 --> 00:10:12,881
Why you looking at me
like that? Huh?

137
00:10:12,953 --> 00:10:16,047
When I was little, I wanted to know
what caused thunder...

138
00:10:16,123 --> 00:10:19,456
How'd it go with Grace?
How'd it go?

139
00:10:19,527 --> 00:10:21,552
- Can we leave, please, Bob?
- Sure.

140
00:10:23,364 --> 00:10:26,561
Little kids are really cute.
She is a cute little kid.

141
00:10:26,634 --> 00:10:31,162
What happened? I just have no idea.
I mean, how did Grace get so cynical?

142
00:10:31,238 --> 00:10:35,004
I can't answer that now. My only concern
is getting you back in the car.

143
00:10:35,075 --> 00:10:38,238
- She's come to this conclusion...
- Get back in the car where you can...

144
00:10:38,312 --> 00:10:43,249
- She thinks I'm a failure.
- What? She said you were a failure?

145
00:10:43,317 --> 00:10:45,547
What has she ever accomplished
with her life?

146
00:10:45,619 --> 00:10:48,087
- What do I do?
- You don't have to do anything.

147
00:10:48,155 --> 00:10:51,022
I'm not saying that
she has to look up to me at all.

148
00:10:51,091 --> 00:10:54,492
- Don't worry about it.
- Maybe she should. Why not?

149
00:10:54,562 --> 00:10:58,498
- She told her friend I was a pilot.
- Stop for a second and look at this.

150
00:10:58,566 --> 00:11:01,399
- Oh, no.
- Fact: I learned more...

151
00:11:01,468 --> 00:11:03,561
in the two months
I spent with Mr. Henry...

152
00:11:03,637 --> 00:11:06,265
than I learned in 15 years
of academic study.

153
00:11:06,340 --> 00:11:09,275
Fact: I can guarantee you,
after Mr. Henry sees us pull this job...

154
00:11:09,343 --> 00:11:12,039
he's gonna take a personal interest
in our future.

155
00:11:12,112 --> 00:11:14,273
Fact: Mr. Henry
drives a Jaguar.

156
00:11:14,348 --> 00:11:16,976
Fact: The picture's
not doing it for me right now.

157
00:11:17,051 --> 00:11:20,248
Well, does the fact that
I'm trying to do it do it for you?

158
00:11:20,321 --> 00:11:22,346
I hate to interrupt
your conversation, guys...

159
00:11:22,423 --> 00:11:25,153
but I think I know
what you've been going through...

160
00:11:25,226 --> 00:11:27,660
'cause I've been through
some pretty heavy shit myself.

161
00:11:27,728 --> 00:11:30,561
If you're feeling alone,
like nobody in the world cares...

162
00:11:30,631 --> 00:11:34,123
and nobody in the fucking world
gives a shit, then I'm here.

163
00:11:34,201 --> 00:11:36,362
- That was a stop sign.
- I'm ready to listen, man.

164
00:11:36,437 --> 00:11:38,371
If you want,
I'll even open up first.

165
00:11:38,439 --> 00:11:42,739
My brother... That's a shit situation.
He beats the crap out of me always.

166
00:11:49,550 --> 00:11:52,678
I don't suppose either of you know
why Bob's car is parked out front.

167
00:11:52,753 --> 00:11:55,313
Yeah, he's here.

168
00:11:55,389 --> 00:11:57,448
- He's ins...
- He's here at the house.

169
00:11:57,524 --> 00:11:59,458
Let me see if Bob's
keeping the pool clean.

170
00:11:59,526 --> 00:12:01,653
- That's Future Man.
- Yeah, I know.

171
00:12:05,299 --> 00:12:07,233
What the fuck is this?

172
00:12:08,068 --> 00:12:12,528
Vamanos, Clay. Bob, you were told to
thoroughly clean the pool this morning.

173
00:12:12,606 --> 00:12:14,540
- It's a leaf.
- It was one leaf!

174
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:18,044
Your name's Anthony, isn't it?

175
00:12:18,112 --> 00:12:20,842
Yeah, his name's Anthony.
My name's Dignan.

176
00:12:20,914 --> 00:12:23,883
I'm Stacy Sinclair,
Elizabeth's sorority sister.

177
00:12:23,951 --> 00:12:27,045
I didn't know
she had a sister.

178
00:12:27,121 --> 00:12:30,056
Oh, my God.
You have the best sense of humor.

179
00:12:30,124 --> 00:12:33,389
She is going to be so jealous
I saw you here.

180
00:12:33,460 --> 00:12:36,691
So, you go to school
in Arizona, right?

181
00:12:36,764 --> 00:12:40,632
- No, I was in the hospital.
- Oh, what for?

182
00:12:43,570 --> 00:12:45,834
I went nuts.

183
00:12:45,906 --> 00:12:49,239
- He's kidding. He didn't go nuts.
- You poor thing. How'd it happen?

184
00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:52,871
- Do you really wanna know?
- Yes, I really do.

185
00:12:56,216 --> 00:12:59,413
One morning
over at Elizabeth's beach house...

186
00:12:59,486 --> 00:13:04,150
she asked me if I'd rather
go water skiing or lay out.

187
00:13:04,224 --> 00:13:08,786
And I realized that not only did I
not want to answer that question...

188
00:13:08,862 --> 00:13:12,764
but I never wanted to answer
another water-sports question...

189
00:13:12,833 --> 00:13:16,325
or see any of these people again
for the rest of my life.

190
00:13:17,871 --> 00:13:21,329
Three days later I was on my way
out to the desert, and that was that.

191
00:13:23,344 --> 00:13:25,403
Bullying son of a bitch!

192
00:13:25,479 --> 00:13:28,812
You're calling me a bully?
Here's a bully for ya!

193
00:13:31,552 --> 00:13:34,020
Hold on, Bob! You're only
gonna make this take longer!

194
00:13:34,088 --> 00:13:36,147
You're really complicated,
aren't you?

195
00:13:36,223 --> 00:13:38,919
- My ear!
- I try not to be.

196
00:14:18,465 --> 00:14:21,400
Okay, escape route is crucial...

197
00:14:21,468 --> 00:14:24,904
in case somebody is tailing us
or even chasing us, as the case may be.

198
00:14:24,972 --> 00:14:27,236
We can't be sure
how it is gonna happen.

199
00:14:27,307 --> 00:14:29,502
Do you think
we're gonna be chased?

200
00:14:29,576 --> 00:14:32,568
That's a good question.
No, I don't think we're gonna be chased.

201
00:14:32,646 --> 00:14:35,774
I'm just being hypocritical here.
However, I will say...

202
00:14:35,849 --> 00:14:39,910
Bob, please don't interrupt me, man,
'cause I'm trying to stay focused.

203
00:14:39,987 --> 00:14:44,356
You're responsible for the external
situation, streets and the getaway.

204
00:14:44,425 --> 00:14:48,327
Excuse me. Are the explosives
really necessary here?

205
00:14:48,395 --> 00:14:51,728
I think it would be a lot more simple if
I just walked up to the door alone.

206
00:14:51,799 --> 00:14:54,495
- I think that would be...
- Why are you undermining me?

207
00:14:54,568 --> 00:14:57,935
How many bullets does this thing take?
Look, I'm paying attention.

208
00:14:58,005 --> 00:15:01,441
Goddamn it! You're not paying attention
if you're messing around with the gun!

209
00:15:01,508 --> 00:15:04,306
Now, quit... Anthony,
keep the gun on the table.

210
00:15:04,378 --> 00:15:05,811
Look, Dignan, relax.

211
00:15:05,879 --> 00:15:08,507
I can't focus
unless the gun is on the table.

212
00:15:08,582 --> 00:15:10,641
- I paid for it.
- Shut up, man!

213
00:15:10,717 --> 00:15:12,912
I'm warning you now.
Be quiet, please.

214
00:15:12,986 --> 00:15:16,444
- It's true. I paid for the gun.
- Say it one more time.

215
00:15:16,523 --> 00:15:19,185
Say it again.
Repeat what you just said.

216
00:15:21,495 --> 00:15:23,292
I paid for the gun.

217
00:15:30,103 --> 00:15:32,663
He's out. You're out too.

218
00:15:32,739 --> 00:15:34,707
- And I don't think I'm in, either.
- Calm down.

219
00:15:34,775 --> 00:15:37,938
No gang!
You two just don't give a shit.

220
00:15:38,011 --> 00:15:41,344
When it comes right down to it,
you don't care.

221
00:15:41,415 --> 00:15:44,282
How does an asshole like Bob
get such a great kitchen?

222
00:16:00,234 --> 00:16:03,761
I apologize.
That was poor leadership.

223
00:16:03,837 --> 00:16:07,034
I'm under a lot of pressure
right now, and...

224
00:16:08,375 --> 00:16:11,071
I don't feel like the team
is gelling the way...

225
00:16:11,144 --> 00:16:14,341
if I can even use that word, 'cause
I don't even know if we are a team.

226
00:16:14,414 --> 00:16:17,315
Hey, we are a team.

227
00:16:20,754 --> 00:16:23,484
Yeah, a team.

228
00:16:28,428 --> 00:16:31,727
There. You see, the star is me.
Right there. I'll be in there.

229
00:16:31,798 --> 00:16:35,325
The X is Anthony. Bob, you're
the zero out here in the car.

230
00:16:44,344 --> 00:16:46,812
What are you putting that tape
on your nose for?

231
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:48,313
Exactly.

232
00:16:52,786 --> 00:16:54,720
Let's get lucky.

233
00:16:58,659 --> 00:17:01,526
Yo, you open the door.

234
00:17:01,595 --> 00:17:05,258
- Okay, wait right here.
- Come on, let's go.

235
00:17:05,332 --> 00:17:08,597
Don't panic.
Get him to open the door.

236
00:17:08,669 --> 00:17:12,127
- Don't panic.
- I left my sweater inside.

237
00:17:12,205 --> 00:17:15,732
I know. Do you have
a lost and found?

238
00:17:15,809 --> 00:17:18,505
- Here he comes.
- A lost and found?

239
00:17:22,249 --> 00:17:26,049
- I'm sorry. We're closed, sir.
- I left my sweater in...

240
00:17:26,119 --> 00:17:28,417
What's that on your nose?

241
00:17:28,488 --> 00:17:32,117
I cut it. I got a cut across the bridge.
Do you have a lost and found?

242
00:17:32,192 --> 00:17:35,593
- Can you come back tomorrow?
- I can't. I gotta get it tonight.

243
00:17:35,662 --> 00:17:39,462
Well, let me check with my manager.
Hold on one second. Just stand inside.

244
00:17:40,534 --> 00:17:43,059
Hey, excuse me, sir.
We're closed.

245
00:17:43,136 --> 00:17:46,196
- Oh. What about that guy?
- I left my sweater in here.

246
00:17:46,273 --> 00:17:49,538
- He forgot his sweater.
- Oh, yeah? I left some money in there.

247
00:17:49,610 --> 00:17:52,340
- Money? Where?
- In the cash register. Step back.

248
00:17:52,412 --> 00:17:54,471
Stockers!
Where are the other stockers?

249
00:17:54,548 --> 00:17:57,415
Who? Robbie? He might be in Literature.
That's his section.

250
00:17:57,484 --> 00:18:00,647
Hey, is that the manager?
Who is that? Come here!

251
00:18:00,721 --> 00:18:03,053
- I'm gonna go down this aisle.
- What's going on here?

252
00:18:03,123 --> 00:18:05,455
- I'm sending you both back there.
- All right!

253
00:18:05,525 --> 00:18:07,459
Come on, move!

254
00:18:14,301 --> 00:18:16,633
Okay, sit down!
Get up against the wall!

255
00:18:16,703 --> 00:18:19,729
What's in here? Where's the money?
Talk, stretch!

256
00:18:19,806 --> 00:18:21,239
It's in the drawer.

257
00:18:22,342 --> 00:18:24,367
Okay, there it is.
Come on, open up that drawer.

258
00:18:24,444 --> 00:18:26,844
- No, it's not.
- The other one!

259
00:18:28,115 --> 00:18:30,049
There's the money. Okay.

260
00:18:30,117 --> 00:18:32,779
Put it in one of those bags.
Get one of those bags.

261
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:36,314
Let's move! Come on!
A bigger one, you idiot!

262
00:18:36,390 --> 00:18:39,018
Don't call me an idiot,
you punk.

263
00:18:42,629 --> 00:18:47,123
Do you have bigger bags
for atlases or dictionaries, sir?

264
00:18:52,172 --> 00:18:54,299
- Robbie?
- Uh-huh.

265
00:18:54,374 --> 00:18:57,275
Aren't you supposed to be in literature?

266
00:18:57,344 --> 00:19:00,313
- It's all full up.
- They need you in the office right now.

267
00:19:00,380 --> 00:19:03,247
Put the money in the little bags.
We'll just use a lot of them.

268
00:19:03,316 --> 00:19:07,480
Quickly.
Just do your best.

269
00:19:07,554 --> 00:19:09,852
Why do you wear
that tape on your nose?

270
00:19:11,358 --> 00:19:13,349
Little bags, man.

271
00:19:14,728 --> 00:19:18,220
Okay, everybody...
I want everybody to just sit tight.

272
00:19:18,298 --> 00:19:21,267
Okay. Thank you so much.

273
00:19:24,171 --> 00:19:27,231
Success! Full success!
We're heading back to Bob's.

274
00:19:27,307 --> 00:19:32,040
We're gonna hit the road
and go on the lam! Go!

275
00:19:34,981 --> 00:19:37,848
Okay now, before we divide the loot,
let me say one thing.

276
00:19:37,918 --> 00:19:41,581
Bob gets the "Spirit Award"
on this caper.

277
00:19:41,655 --> 00:19:44,055
And although his share
won't be as equal as ours...

278
00:19:44,124 --> 00:19:46,456
- What? What are you...
- Come here, Bob.

279
00:19:46,526 --> 00:19:49,791
Did you see the look he gave me?
Don't double-cross this guy.

280
00:19:49,863 --> 00:19:54,027
Great work, both of you.
Clink, clink.

281
00:19:54,101 --> 00:19:56,535
So, Dignan, what's next?

282
00:19:56,603 --> 00:19:59,197
Do we meet the crew
after we go on the lam or what?

283
00:19:59,272 --> 00:20:02,139
Everybody wants to know what's next.
May I enjoy this moment?

284
00:20:02,209 --> 00:20:03,733
What crew?

285
00:20:04,578 --> 00:20:06,842
Now is not a good time
to bring up the crew.

286
00:20:06,913 --> 00:20:08,744
Goddamn it.

287
00:20:08,815 --> 00:20:11,807
Ya son of a bitch!
You're gonna cut me out!

288
00:20:11,885 --> 00:20:16,345
Wait a second, Bob. Nobody's
cutting anybody out of anything.

289
00:20:16,423 --> 00:20:18,891
- Let me show you this.
- Whoa.

290
00:20:18,959 --> 00:20:21,587
Bob should see this.

291
00:20:21,661 --> 00:20:24,494
Bob, I got something.

292
00:20:24,564 --> 00:20:27,692
- What's this supposed to be?
- That's the crew.

293
00:20:27,768 --> 00:20:29,929
That's Mr. Henry.
He's a... I know.

294
00:20:30,771 --> 00:20:33,797
Anthony, that's the Lawn Wranglers...

295
00:20:33,874 --> 00:20:37,310
the landscape company
that Dignan here used to work for.

296
00:20:37,377 --> 00:20:39,311
What do you mean, landscaping?

297
00:20:39,379 --> 00:20:44,942
I mean push the mower,
trim the hedge... landscaping.

298
00:20:49,222 --> 00:20:52,316
- Landscaping?
- Landscaping.

299
00:20:55,362 --> 00:20:59,458
Yes, they're landscapers, okay?
Yes, they're landscapers.

300
00:20:59,533 --> 00:21:01,865
But did it ever occur to you
that a landscaping crew...

301
00:21:01,935 --> 00:21:04,165
is a perfect front
for an operation?

302
00:21:04,237 --> 00:21:06,831
Look at this.
You've seen this picture.

303
00:21:06,907 --> 00:21:09,933
That is Mr. Henry, and aside
from owning the Lawn Wranglers...

304
00:21:10,010 --> 00:21:11,944
he is a very talented thief.

305
00:21:12,012 --> 00:21:15,243
Then why aren't you over there
right now?

306
00:21:15,315 --> 00:21:17,579
Because we're fugitives.

307
00:21:20,220 --> 00:21:22,347
And also because he fired me.

308
00:21:27,027 --> 00:21:29,621
Best job I ever had...

309
00:21:29,696 --> 00:21:32,824
working my way up, meeting people...

310
00:21:32,899 --> 00:21:35,493
listening to stories.

311
00:21:35,569 --> 00:21:39,130
One day he walks over and says,
"Dignan, you're out," just like that.

312
00:21:41,107 --> 00:21:43,041
By the way, man, he was right.

313
00:21:43,109 --> 00:21:46,977
Just because it's a front doesn't mean
somebody doesn't have to do landscaping.

314
00:21:49,783 --> 00:21:51,774
But those days are over now.

315
00:21:51,852 --> 00:21:54,252
Just a matter of time
before I pick up the phone and say...

316
00:21:54,321 --> 00:21:57,688
"Mr. H., we are coming home."

317
00:21:57,757 --> 00:22:01,693
So don't worry about your future, man,
because I am thinking.

318
00:22:09,569 --> 00:22:11,901
If you don't mind, I'd appreciate it
if you didn't mention...

319
00:22:11,972 --> 00:22:13,963
to Bob about me getting fired.

320
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:15,632
I won't.

321
00:22:27,153 --> 00:22:29,587
On the run from Johnny Law.

322
00:22:29,656 --> 00:22:31,647
It ain't no trip to Cleveland.

323
00:23:00,587 --> 00:23:02,077
I love it!

324
00:23:03,156 --> 00:23:04,714
And another one for me!

325
00:23:06,660 --> 00:23:08,218
Bobby, one for you!

326
00:23:08,295 --> 00:23:10,422
Anthony, fire away!

327
00:23:10,497 --> 00:23:13,660
Somebody hand me one! I'm gonna
throw it out the window! Cherry bomb!

328
00:23:15,168 --> 00:23:17,363
Did you hear that?

329
00:23:17,437 --> 00:23:20,736
Dignan, I don't expect you
to be as depressed as I am...

330
00:23:20,807 --> 00:23:23,105
but I don't think...
Watch the road, Bob.

331
00:23:23,176 --> 00:23:26,942
But I don't think that
your happiness is quite appropriate.

332
00:23:27,013 --> 00:23:30,710
I mean, your 75-year plan
does not seem to be working, you know?

333
00:23:30,784 --> 00:23:34,880
The only thing I've learned so far
is that crime does not pay.

334
00:23:36,356 --> 00:23:39,325
Gee, man, that's not the greatest
attitude in the world to have.

335
00:23:39,392 --> 00:23:41,724
I don't think we get anywhere
by complaining, guys.

336
00:23:41,795 --> 00:23:44,195
Okay. You're right.

337
00:23:44,264 --> 00:23:46,198
There we go.

338
00:23:46,266 --> 00:23:49,292
Perfect little place to lie low.

339
00:23:49,369 --> 00:23:52,702
We'II get in touch with Mr. Henry.
I'll get the best room in the house.

340
00:23:52,772 --> 00:23:54,205
Crime does pay.

341
00:25:17,424 --> 00:25:21,622
I can't get my hair cut.
That's just no possible, all right?

342
00:25:21,694 --> 00:25:25,255
You're gonna have to dye it red, man,
'cause we need to hide our identities.

343
00:25:25,331 --> 00:25:28,698
No, I'm sorry.
I can't do that either.

344
00:25:28,768 --> 00:25:33,228
Even if it's the difference between
some trooper throwing us in jail or not?

345
00:25:33,306 --> 00:25:34,739
I guess so.

346
00:25:34,808 --> 00:25:37,641
Then you, my dear friend,
are a damn fool.

347
00:25:37,710 --> 00:25:41,168
Let's go, Bob.
Come on. Bob, let's go!

348
00:25:41,247 --> 00:25:43,181
- See you.
- See you later, Bob.

349
00:25:43,249 --> 00:25:44,716
A damn fool!

350
00:25:53,693 --> 00:25:56,856
- Excuse me.
- No, it's okay. Come on in.

351
00:25:59,199 --> 00:26:01,133
Oh, excuse me.

352
00:26:05,772 --> 00:26:08,707
Gee, it's great how you're able
to bring a room to life like this...

353
00:26:08,775 --> 00:26:10,709
with just a little touch.

354
00:26:18,251 --> 00:26:22,688
Geez, it's...
It's nice out today, isn't it?

355
00:26:22,755 --> 00:26:25,519
Boy, you get a nice breeze
with that door open like this.

356
00:26:25,592 --> 00:26:27,526
It was kind of stuffy in here.

357
00:26:27,594 --> 00:26:30,461
Do you do all of these rooms
yourself? All of these...

358
00:26:32,098 --> 00:26:35,033
I'm Anthony. Anthony.

359
00:26:39,706 --> 00:26:41,367
What's your name?

360
00:26:41,441 --> 00:26:44,933
- Inez.
- Inez. That's... Wow.

361
00:26:50,483 --> 00:26:52,178
Oh. Sorry.

362
00:26:56,756 --> 00:26:59,589
Sorry this is such a mess here.

363
00:26:59,659 --> 00:27:02,150
Here, let me give you
a hand with this.

364
00:27:14,774 --> 00:27:16,935
I think I might've seen you
earlier when I was swimming.

365
00:27:17,010 --> 00:27:20,502
Did you happen to see me there?
By the pool?

366
00:27:21,881 --> 00:27:24,441
Yeah, that was me.

367
00:27:24,517 --> 00:27:25,950
Yep.

368
00:27:29,055 --> 00:27:31,489
You speak English?

369
00:27:31,558 --> 00:27:32,991
Spanish?

370
00:27:34,661 --> 00:27:39,325
You have really good posture, you know?
You stand up very straight.

371
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:43,066
You know, people think
that 'cause they're in a hotel...

372
00:27:43,136 --> 00:27:45,730
that they can really
just kind of act like slobs.

373
00:27:45,805 --> 00:27:48,569
It's bad manners,
if you ask me.

374
00:27:48,641 --> 00:27:51,269
But then, if I were guilty
of it, yeah.

375
00:27:51,344 --> 00:27:53,676
Which part of Mexico are you from?

376
00:27:53,746 --> 00:27:55,680
- Paraguay.
- Paraguay.

377
00:27:55,748 --> 00:27:58,182
Boy, okay.
That's kind of over...

378
00:27:58,251 --> 00:28:00,185
- Excuse me.
- Under Guatemala, I think.

379
00:28:00,253 --> 00:28:02,187
Sorry, Inez.

380
00:28:04,457 --> 00:28:07,221
These towels are still warm.

381
00:28:07,293 --> 00:28:10,285
I guess that's
from the dryer. See?

382
00:28:12,765 --> 00:28:14,130
Housekeeping.

383
00:28:15,268 --> 00:28:17,998
- Sorry.
- No. We're just checking out.

384
00:28:34,153 --> 00:28:37,316
- 0 and 2.
- Son of a bitch!

385
00:28:38,658 --> 00:28:41,752
That's a good haircut there.
Parted on the side.

386
00:28:41,828 --> 00:28:43,853
- Thank you.
- That's what my friend needs to get.

387
00:28:43,930 --> 00:28:45,864
Bob, get one like this.

388
00:28:45,932 --> 00:28:48,628
- They're one out away from a win.
- Here, you go first.

389
00:28:48,701 --> 00:28:50,760
May I speak to you
for a moment, please?

390
00:28:50,837 --> 00:28:53,305
It's about my marijuana crop.
I don't want everyone to hear this.

391
00:28:53,373 --> 00:28:56,365
- I don't want to lose my place in line.
- My brother is in jail.

392
00:28:56,442 --> 00:29:01,038
What? Wait a second.
Your brother's... Why?

393
00:29:01,114 --> 00:29:03,912
- The weed.
- What weed?

394
00:29:03,983 --> 00:29:06,850
The weed from my back...
from my back yard.

395
00:29:12,425 --> 00:29:16,589
They got him by the balls.
What's the official charge?

396
00:29:16,663 --> 00:29:18,722
They say he's a drug dealer.

397
00:29:19,799 --> 00:29:23,200
That's so unfair.
They say he's a drug dealer?

398
00:29:23,269 --> 00:29:25,567
You and I both know
he's not a drug dealer.

399
00:29:25,638 --> 00:29:27,765
Right?

400
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:30,104
- He's not a drug dealer.
- I know, Dignan. I know.

401
00:29:30,176 --> 00:29:34,738
Well? Well, Bob, what about
hiding our identities?

402
00:29:36,316 --> 00:29:39,808
I'm sorry, guys. We're gonna
have to take a rain check.

403
00:29:44,691 --> 00:29:48,718
God, this is great,
sitting here in the laundry room...

404
00:29:48,795 --> 00:29:53,459
you working on your vocabulary
and we're sharing these tamales.

405
00:29:56,269 --> 00:29:58,999
It's... It's just, how unexpected.

406
00:30:01,274 --> 00:30:04,004
What is that, Inez?

407
00:30:04,077 --> 00:30:06,773
Does that open?

408
00:30:12,652 --> 00:30:15,143
Wow, you were just a little girl
when this was taken.

409
00:30:15,221 --> 00:30:17,849
A little girl in Paraguay.

410
00:30:21,194 --> 00:30:24,220
May I keep this?
May I have it?

411
00:30:26,733 --> 00:30:28,928
She's my sister.

412
00:30:29,001 --> 00:30:30,832
Really?

413
00:30:32,505 --> 00:30:34,666
She looks just like you.

414
00:30:37,310 --> 00:30:39,369
Can I keep it anyway?

415
00:30:55,962 --> 00:30:59,363
- I'm sorry. We're in the wrong room.
- No, man, this is...

416
00:30:59,432 --> 00:31:01,866
No. Okay, I guess
there's been a mistake made.

417
00:31:01,934 --> 00:31:06,564
212? Do you speak English?
We have a friend.

418
00:31:12,845 --> 00:31:14,278
What the...

419
00:31:16,482 --> 00:31:18,677
Thought you guys
went to get your hair cut.

420
00:31:18,751 --> 00:31:20,651
No, we didn't.

421
00:31:21,387 --> 00:31:23,685
Well, gang,
this is my friend Dig...

422
00:31:23,756 --> 00:31:27,385
My name's Jerry, and this is Cornelius.
Anthony, what's going on?

423
00:31:27,460 --> 00:31:30,623
I'm having a party in here.
I made some banana daiquiris.

424
00:31:30,696 --> 00:31:33,221
- Do you want one?
- Yeah, I guess I'll have one.

425
00:31:33,299 --> 00:31:36,029
Come on in here, man.

426
00:31:36,102 --> 00:31:39,367
This is Inez,
and that's Rocky right there.

427
00:31:39,439 --> 00:31:41,703
Come on, Bob. Shut the door.
Get in here, man.

428
00:31:41,774 --> 00:31:45,210
Anybody else want anything?
Soda for Rocky.

429
00:31:45,278 --> 00:31:48,441
- Come on, Bob, let me get you one.
- Anthony, I've got to talk to you!

430
00:31:48,514 --> 00:31:50,914
Look, I'm sorry.
This seems like a nice soiree...

431
00:31:50,983 --> 00:31:52,678
but I've got a family situation.

432
00:31:52,752 --> 00:31:54,845
I don't care what you think.

433
00:31:57,590 --> 00:32:02,357
Dignan does not want to deal with it.
Please come outside for a minute!

434
00:32:02,428 --> 00:32:05,795
Bob, I'm just saying we gotta
analyze the situation, okay?

435
00:32:05,865 --> 00:32:08,333
First of all,
how long are they gonna hold him?

436
00:32:08,401 --> 00:32:12,497
I don't know. All I know is that Phil
says they got him, that he's in jail.

437
00:32:12,572 --> 00:32:16,736
Okay, I've made a suggestion
that he needs to hire an attorney.

438
00:32:16,809 --> 00:32:18,800
You are pushing your luck, man.

439
00:32:18,878 --> 00:32:22,370
- Hey, Dignan, he does have a point.
- I'm the leader.

440
00:32:22,448 --> 00:32:25,417
- You think I should abandon my brother?
- Yeah.

441
00:32:25,485 --> 00:32:29,285
I'm saying let's keep it...
Let's keep it very simple, okay?

442
00:32:29,355 --> 00:32:34,156
We'll make some calls,
figure out what's going on...

443
00:32:34,227 --> 00:32:37,424
and if he's not out in 48 hours,
then we'II go back, okay?

444
00:32:40,066 --> 00:32:42,830
- What?
- Is that okay?

445
00:32:45,271 --> 00:32:48,536
And I wasn't trying to antagonize you
by saying that stuff.

446
00:32:48,608 --> 00:32:50,599
It's just you were gonna
fly off half-cocked.

447
00:32:50,676 --> 00:32:54,578
- Don't tell me what I was gonna do.
- It's a team decision.

448
00:33:09,328 --> 00:33:13,059
What? What did you...
What does that mean?

449
00:33:19,872 --> 00:33:22,204
l... I don't know
what to say.

450
00:33:22,275 --> 00:33:25,142
- What I'm talking?
- No.

451
00:33:32,418 --> 00:33:34,545
Your skin feels like silk.

452
00:33:35,955 --> 00:33:37,889
Like silk?

453
00:33:40,359 --> 00:33:44,261
- What silk?
- Your skin, it feels so soft and silky.

454
00:33:44,330 --> 00:33:47,959
- It's soft.
- Silk?

455
00:33:48,034 --> 00:33:50,798
Sandpaper. Silk.

456
00:33:52,271 --> 00:33:56,139
- Silk. A new word.
- It's very soft.

457
00:33:56,208 --> 00:33:58,335
I don't know it in Spanish.

458
00:34:01,681 --> 00:34:03,945
Can I kiss you?

459
00:34:18,264 --> 00:34:20,755
Marco! Marco!

460
00:34:23,502 --> 00:34:27,097
No lifeguard on duty.
Swim at your own risk.

461
00:34:29,375 --> 00:34:33,709
Okay, we'll... We'll be
very careful, Jerry. Thank you.

462
00:34:33,779 --> 00:34:36,714
You guys mind if I take a dip?
Hey, I'm kidding.

463
00:34:36,782 --> 00:34:39,046
I'm not that insensitive.

464
00:34:39,118 --> 00:34:43,179
Besides, I didn't bring my trunks,
anyway. How's the water down there?

465
00:34:43,255 --> 00:34:47,157
I'm gonna give you something, okay?
I want you to hold onto this.

466
00:34:48,828 --> 00:34:52,286
Well, thank you for listening
to our old war stories.

467
00:34:52,365 --> 00:34:55,027
I hope they didn't bore you
too terribly.

468
00:35:00,039 --> 00:35:03,998
- Well, anyway, good evening.
- Bye, Jerry.

469
00:35:04,076 --> 00:35:06,510
Anyways, the watch, okay?

470
00:35:06,579 --> 00:35:08,274
It has an alarm on it...

471
00:35:08,347 --> 00:35:11,942
and will go off and make a sound
when we're supposed to meet.

472
00:35:12,018 --> 00:35:15,749
You do that by this little button.
You can just press that. See?

473
00:35:18,791 --> 00:35:20,725
It's pretty simple.

474
00:35:26,632 --> 00:35:29,465
- I have to go.
- I'm very glad I met you, Inez.

475
00:35:29,535 --> 00:35:31,730
Me too. I have to go.

476
00:35:47,687 --> 00:35:49,712
Son of a bitch!

477
00:35:53,826 --> 00:35:56,761
Bob's gone!
He stole his car!

478
00:35:56,829 --> 00:35:59,525
That little coward!
That son of a bitch!

479
00:36:00,833 --> 00:36:03,165
Son of a bitch, man.

480
00:36:06,639 --> 00:36:09,335
He flew the coop
while we were sleepin'.

481
00:36:10,776 --> 00:36:13,574
- He has no character, man.
- Maybe he went up to the store.

482
00:36:13,646 --> 00:36:16,376
No, man, he took his stuff.
He's long gone.

483
00:36:16,449 --> 00:36:19,680
Hi, housekeeping?
Could I speak to Inez, please?

484
00:36:19,752 --> 00:36:22,778
I thought she gets in at 9:00.

485
00:36:22,855 --> 00:36:25,585
Oh, it... Okay. See,
I don't have my watch on.

486
00:36:25,658 --> 00:36:27,489
She has it.

487
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:30,324
Tell me something.
What's it like working with her?

488
00:36:30,396 --> 00:36:33,797
I bet she's really great at...
Okay. Bye.

489
00:36:34,867 --> 00:36:38,200
We'll get him. We'II get him, man.
Don't worry about that.

490
00:36:38,270 --> 00:36:42,036
And we'll blow up his car
or do something, I guarantee you that.

491
00:36:42,108 --> 00:36:45,737
What makes me furious is thinking
about the look on Bob's fat face...

492
00:36:45,811 --> 00:36:49,542
when he drives away today thinking
that he's pulled one over on us.

493
00:36:49,615 --> 00:36:52,083
- I'll tell you another thing...
- Dignan, please.

494
00:36:52,151 --> 00:36:56,417
If our paths cross again, you're gonna
see a side of me you haven't seen yet...

495
00:36:56,489 --> 00:37:00,016
a sick, sadistic side...
because I'm furious at Bob.

496
00:37:00,092 --> 00:37:03,493
- Come on, Dignan!
- Come on what?

497
00:37:03,562 --> 00:37:07,396
Bob didn't steal the car.
You know, he told me he was leaving.

498
00:37:07,466 --> 00:37:10,458
He went back to help his brother.

499
00:37:15,407 --> 00:37:18,535
Dignan, look. I'm sorry that I didn't
tell you about Bob leaving.

500
00:37:18,611 --> 00:37:21,808
You had just as much right
to know as I did. I'm sorry.

501
00:37:21,881 --> 00:37:24,748
Thank you.
That's all I needed.

502
00:37:24,817 --> 00:37:27,911
I mean, who's to say that you need Bob
to have an adventure?

503
00:37:27,987 --> 00:37:30,751
Where's that rule written?
There's nothing that says that.

504
00:37:30,823 --> 00:37:32,757
What are you working on?

505
00:37:32,825 --> 00:37:35,293
Just a sketch. It's...

506
00:37:36,762 --> 00:37:38,957
It's, you know,
just a little horse...

507
00:37:40,366 --> 00:37:44,359
with little sparks comin' off,
kind of like stardust.

508
00:37:44,436 --> 00:37:46,597
Nothin'.

509
00:37:48,340 --> 00:37:49,602
Sorry. It's just...

510
00:37:49,675 --> 00:37:52,838
Don't apologize to me.
Don't do that to me.

511
00:37:52,912 --> 00:37:56,746
Don't treat me like the jealous friend,
because that's not what this is about.

512
00:37:56,816 --> 00:37:59,785
I'm as excited for you
as anybody is.

513
00:37:59,852 --> 00:38:02,548
Really? Then I gotta go.

514
00:38:02,621 --> 00:38:04,646
I'll see you later, Dignan.
See you back at the room.

515
00:39:28,107 --> 00:39:30,837
It's so weird,
the way this happened.

516
00:39:30,910 --> 00:39:33,310
It's so good to be with you.

517
00:39:57,736 --> 00:40:00,728
Why don't you come over to this bar
we're going to, Dignan?

518
00:40:00,806 --> 00:40:03,707
- Where?
- It's in the town.

519
00:40:03,776 --> 00:40:05,744
No, I don't want to go.

520
00:40:08,047 --> 00:40:10,641
Why don't you just come with us?

521
00:40:17,222 --> 00:40:20,658
Why don't you just
come over there with us?

522
00:40:20,726 --> 00:40:22,318
All right.

523
00:40:30,736 --> 00:40:32,169
Sparkler.

524
00:40:32,237 --> 00:40:34,398
I certainly can't feel
any worse than I do.

525
00:40:34,473 --> 00:40:36,407
Don't worry.
All he needs is one drink.

526
00:40:39,411 --> 00:40:41,345
Hello, my friend.

527
00:40:44,850 --> 00:40:49,287
- You're in the army, yes?
- No. I just have short hair.

528
00:40:50,456 --> 00:40:53,220
Amigo, let's play pool!

529
00:41:14,813 --> 00:41:17,805
Boy, that guy was
a real chatterbox, wasn't he?

530
00:41:17,883 --> 00:41:21,614
I didn't think he was ever gonna
stop with the story. Jesus!

531
00:41:21,687 --> 00:41:24,315
That's what I call
a language barrier.

532
00:41:24,390 --> 00:41:27,951
- I need to take it easy.
- Amigo, you just cheated!

533
00:41:28,027 --> 00:41:30,325
Okay! I'm calling my gang!

534
00:41:30,396 --> 00:41:34,958
It's just a little frustrating
when you guys talk so easily.

535
00:41:35,034 --> 00:41:39,630
God, you know, I can't believe the guy
just decided to jump you like that.

536
00:41:41,974 --> 00:41:44,943
- Can you pass me those french fries?
- Yeah.

537
00:41:46,211 --> 00:41:50,477
Dignan, you know I was right out
in front of the place with Inez.

538
00:41:50,549 --> 00:41:53,143
If you don't mind,
I'd rather not relive it.

539
00:41:54,353 --> 00:41:56,878
Don't really feel
much like talking about it.

540
00:41:58,557 --> 00:42:02,015
In fact, the only thing I feel like
is getting the fuck out of this town.

541
00:42:02,094 --> 00:42:06,030
Yeah. We need a car, I think.

542
00:42:06,098 --> 00:42:08,157
I have an idea for that.

543
00:42:08,233 --> 00:42:11,725
Inez has a master key
to all the rooms, doesn't she?

544
00:42:12,971 --> 00:42:15,337
Doesn't she?

545
00:42:15,407 --> 00:42:17,341
I don't think we can do that.

546
00:42:17,409 --> 00:42:19,468
I know we can.
It's real simple.

547
00:42:19,545 --> 00:42:22,275
We go into another room,
take some car keys...

548
00:42:22,347 --> 00:42:25,339
It's not even
a possibility, okay?

549
00:42:32,357 --> 00:42:34,917
Then we're gonna
have to hot-wire a car...

550
00:42:34,993 --> 00:42:37,655
and this idea
I don't back down from.

551
00:42:37,729 --> 00:42:41,165
- This idea...
- Inez, let's go outside.

552
00:42:41,233 --> 00:42:43,167
- Jerry's not...
- How are you, Jerry?

553
00:42:45,637 --> 00:42:47,696
I feel great, Inez.

554
00:42:47,773 --> 00:42:51,334
He's under the weather
a little bit.

555
00:42:51,410 --> 00:42:54,607
- So, l...
- Bye.

556
00:42:54,680 --> 00:42:57,444
I kind of gotta take care of him
for a few minutes.

557
00:43:03,188 --> 00:43:06,123
I had a really great time.

558
00:43:30,716 --> 00:43:34,015
Inez, I'm sorry to interrupt you,
but I think I've got it.

559
00:43:35,487 --> 00:43:39,446
I've gotta talk to you, Inez.
I got a lot I need to tell you.

560
00:43:39,525 --> 00:43:43,052
Thirty seconds ago, I was lost,
just in a total fog...

561
00:43:43,128 --> 00:43:45,892
and then it hit me
like a bolt of lightning.

562
00:43:45,964 --> 00:43:50,094
Perfect clarity. Don't slow me down.
I gotta get this out while it's fresh.

563
00:43:50,169 --> 00:43:52,763
Um, this could get
a little tough to communicate.

564
00:43:52,838 --> 00:43:54,772
Where's the kid?
Where's Rocky?

565
00:43:54,840 --> 00:43:56,603
- Hey, Rocky.
- Yeah?

566
00:43:56,675 --> 00:43:59,007
- Can you help me out?
- What do you need?

567
00:43:59,077 --> 00:44:01,409
I just need you
to translate some stuff.

568
00:44:01,480 --> 00:44:04,005
I can't. I'm busy.
I got too much work.

569
00:44:04,082 --> 00:44:06,710
It'll take two seconds.
Just give me three minutes.

570
00:44:06,785 --> 00:44:10,380
Come on. Please. I'll help you
finish the dishes later.

571
00:44:12,157 --> 00:44:15,126
Okay, this is what I want to say.
This is how I see it.

572
00:44:16,895 --> 00:44:21,662
Beautiful, intelligent girl
from Paraguay...

573
00:44:23,335 --> 00:44:27,135
by chance happens to be workin'
at a motel in the middle of nowhere.

574
00:44:27,206 --> 00:44:30,664
Lost and confused.
Totally lost.

575
00:44:30,742 --> 00:44:33,074
Incredibly unhappy person...

576
00:44:33,145 --> 00:44:36,478
accidentally wanders in
off the highway...

577
00:44:37,583 --> 00:44:41,212
and they meet
and they fall in love...

578
00:44:41,286 --> 00:44:43,015
and it's perfect.

579
00:44:43,088 --> 00:44:45,249
I mean, it is perfect.

580
00:44:46,425 --> 00:44:48,188
And I can only hope...

581
00:44:48,260 --> 00:44:53,391
that she feels a tenth
of the way that I feel.

582
00:44:56,835 --> 00:44:59,736
I mean, Inez, when we had sex
this afternoon, it was...

583
00:44:59,805 --> 00:45:02,467
It was fun, you know?

584
00:45:04,109 --> 00:45:05,508
So... Come on, Rocky.

585
00:45:12,084 --> 00:45:14,917
Okay, so to make
a long story short...

586
00:45:16,788 --> 00:45:20,485
when we leave here tomorrow,
I want you to come with us.

587
00:45:23,262 --> 00:45:24,923
And I want us, no matter what...

588
00:45:26,164 --> 00:45:27,495
Where are you going?

589
00:45:28,700 --> 00:45:31,897
- What?
- Where are you going?

590
00:45:31,970 --> 00:45:34,200
Where are we going?

591
00:45:36,408 --> 00:45:39,900
What do you want me to say?
You want me to live with you and Jerry?

592
00:45:39,978 --> 00:45:42,139
- I can't go.
- Why not?

593
00:45:42,214 --> 00:45:44,444
Why?

594
00:45:46,218 --> 00:45:49,210
- I just told you why not.
- That's no reason, Inez.

595
00:45:49,288 --> 00:45:52,155
I'm trying to explain to you
why I want you to come with us.

596
00:46:00,032 --> 00:46:02,762
Look. Wait, wait.

597
00:46:02,834 --> 00:46:05,860
We'll stay here, all right?
I don't understand it, but...

598
00:46:05,937 --> 00:46:09,703
I'm just gonna follow
my instincts on this one.

599
00:46:17,082 --> 00:46:20,142
You're like paper.
You know, you're trash.

600
00:46:21,987 --> 00:46:23,420
Like trash?

601
00:46:23,488 --> 00:46:25,786
You know, you're
like paper flying by.

602
00:46:26,858 --> 00:46:29,292
It doesn't sound
that bad in Spanish.

603
00:46:42,674 --> 00:46:44,608
Well, what, Rocky?

604
00:46:45,744 --> 00:46:48,975
She... She doesn't
want you to stay.

605
00:46:51,516 --> 00:46:52,949
She doesn't?

606
00:46:53,018 --> 00:46:55,919
You have to understand.
She's an organized person.

607
00:46:55,987 --> 00:47:00,253
- She can't just leave.
- She didn't say that, did she, Rocky?

608
00:47:00,325 --> 00:47:03,055
No, but I'm just telling you,
she's a serious person.

609
00:47:03,128 --> 00:47:05,426
Please, just do the...

610
00:47:20,212 --> 00:47:21,804
Excuse me.

611
00:47:24,649 --> 00:47:27,584
Mi amigo Anthony asked me
to give you this envelope.

612
00:47:27,652 --> 00:47:30,450
There you go. We certainly
enjoyed our stay here.

613
00:47:30,522 --> 00:47:34,151
We'd recommend this motel
to any of our friends that might...

614
00:47:35,727 --> 00:47:37,661
Take care of Anthony.

615
00:47:45,937 --> 00:47:49,668
- Is okay?
- Yeah, I feel a lot better.

616
00:47:56,114 --> 00:47:58,048
So long.

617
00:48:14,900 --> 00:48:16,367
Jerry!

618
00:48:20,338 --> 00:48:23,171
- Tell Anthony I love him.
- Do what?

619
00:48:24,242 --> 00:48:26,176
Tell Anthony I love him.

620
00:48:31,950 --> 00:48:34,009
All right, man. Okay.

621
00:49:50,095 --> 00:49:53,895
Shit, man.
What a lemon!

622
00:49:53,965 --> 00:49:56,661
I don't know, man.
One minute it's running like a top...

623
00:49:56,735 --> 00:49:59,932
and the next minute it's broken down
on the side of the road.

624
00:50:00,005 --> 00:50:03,668
I can't fix a car like this.
I don't have the tools to do it, man!

625
00:50:03,742 --> 00:50:07,303
Even if I did, I can't promise you
I'd know how to fix a car like that!

626
00:50:07,379 --> 00:50:09,745
You see the house over here?

627
00:50:09,814 --> 00:50:12,248
Let's walk over to it.
We'll use the phone.

628
00:50:12,317 --> 00:50:13,909
We need to go home, okay?

629
00:50:13,985 --> 00:50:16,681
Whoa, no.
Let's go to plan B.

630
00:50:16,755 --> 00:50:18,780
We'll hitchhike to the next town...
Look, we hitchhike...

631
00:50:18,857 --> 00:50:21,792
Look, it's over, okay?
We're broke.

632
00:50:21,860 --> 00:50:23,623
We're gonna go home.

633
00:50:23,695 --> 00:50:25,629
First of all, what is broke to you?

634
00:50:25,697 --> 00:50:29,258
You're so spoiled. Having only
a few hundred dollars is not broke.

635
00:50:29,334 --> 00:50:31,529
We're okay.
This is a setback. We hitchhike...

636
00:50:32,604 --> 00:50:34,538
What is this?

637
00:50:36,775 --> 00:50:38,470
All right. $16.

638
00:50:38,543 --> 00:50:40,807
So, where's the rest of the money?

639
00:50:40,879 --> 00:50:43,006
You gave it to Inez.

640
00:50:44,683 --> 00:50:46,913
No, I never gave Inez anything.

641
00:50:48,787 --> 00:50:50,948
In the envelope.

642
00:51:18,650 --> 00:51:23,644
Pointless act! You don't give
a $500 tip to the housekeeper!

643
00:51:23,722 --> 00:51:26,714
That's inappropriate!
That's inexcusable!

644
00:51:26,791 --> 00:51:29,851
That, I don't forgive!
What were you thinking?

645
00:51:31,863 --> 00:51:33,888
- Don't call her the housekeeper.
- That's what she is.

646
00:51:33,965 --> 00:51:36,456
Don't threaten me. That's what she is.
She is a housekeeper.

647
00:51:36,534 --> 00:51:38,832
- People are housekeepers.
- You better watch it.

648
00:51:38,903 --> 00:51:41,337
You don't know what you're talking about
right now.

649
00:51:41,406 --> 00:51:44,204
Her name's Inez.

650
00:51:44,275 --> 00:51:46,869
And my name's Dignan, man.
So what?

651
00:51:49,247 --> 00:51:51,477
She didn't love you, man.

652
00:51:53,985 --> 00:51:55,418
Now where are you going?

653
00:52:09,267 --> 00:52:11,633
Come on. Let's go.

654
00:52:11,703 --> 00:52:13,898
Why did you do it, man?

655
00:52:15,640 --> 00:52:18,871
I don't really think you know
what I was going through back there...

656
00:52:18,943 --> 00:52:21,673
Please don't lay that on me now, man...

657
00:52:21,746 --> 00:52:24,374
because I'm not interested
in hearing any of that.

658
00:52:26,418 --> 00:52:29,819
Did it ever occur to you that I might
enjoy a great stay...

659
00:52:29,888 --> 00:52:32,550
at some mental hospital
out in the middle of nowhere...

660
00:52:32,624 --> 00:52:36,651
going running at night, getting a tan
with a bunch of beautiful girls?

661
00:52:36,728 --> 00:52:38,889
Did you ever think about that?

662
00:52:38,963 --> 00:52:43,423
What do you think Dignan was doing
that whole time you were out there?

663
00:52:43,501 --> 00:52:47,961
I told you Dignan got fired...
out on his ass.

664
00:52:48,039 --> 00:52:50,132
But you never thought about that,
did you?

665
00:52:52,711 --> 00:52:56,147
In the end it's easier to think about
yourself than to think about Dignan.

666
00:52:57,949 --> 00:53:00,474
Dignan, come on.

667
00:53:02,487 --> 00:53:06,548
I thought I was supposed to be the one
that was a little crazy, you know?

668
00:53:10,128 --> 00:53:12,289
Dignan, come on.

669
00:53:51,503 --> 00:53:51,536
"Dear Grace, I en joyed your lefter.

670
00:53:51,536 --> 00:53:54,198
"Dear Grace, I en joyed your lefter.

671
00:53:54,272 --> 00:53:56,866
I agree Camp Douglas isn't all
it's cracked up to be.

672
00:53:56,941 --> 00:53:58,533
It never was.

673
00:53:58,610 --> 00:54:01,204
But if you're feeling lonely
or homesick even...

674
00:54:01,279 --> 00:54:05,238
I recommend thaf, one, you call me.
I'm staying af Bob Mapplethorpe's...

675
00:54:05,316 --> 00:54:07,876
and, two,
fhat you keep extremely busy.

676
00:54:07,952 --> 00:54:11,115
- lf's working for me.
- Come here, Hector.

677
00:54:11,189 --> 00:54:13,555
I've got a whole, new program.

678
00:54:13,625 --> 00:54:17,220
Bob and I get up at 5:30 every morning
fo run our paper route.

679
00:54:17,295 --> 00:54:19,092
I've gof three jobs.

680
00:54:19,164 --> 00:54:23,533
The money isn't much, and Bob
isn't suited for this kind of work.

681
00:54:23,601 --> 00:54:25,296
But we keep each other company...

682
00:54:25,370 --> 00:54:29,238
and we both feel much better about
ourselves now thaf we're working hard.

683
00:54:29,307 --> 00:54:33,334
- Glad you enjoyed it. You all come back.
- Thanks, Mr. Fine.

684
00:54:33,411 --> 00:54:37,347
Jack, I've been working.
I made $75 in tips last night.

685
00:54:37,415 --> 00:54:40,782
Bob's brother, Future Man, has
accumulated some exfensive legal debts.

686
00:54:40,852 --> 00:54:43,286
But we're gradually helping him
fo pay those off.

687
00:54:43,354 --> 00:54:45,322
Can I at least have three bucks for gas?

688
00:54:45,390 --> 00:54:49,759
I'm also coaching a Little League
soccer team called the Hurricanes.

689
00:54:49,828 --> 00:54:52,388
They're mostly beginners,
but they've got a lof of spirit...

690
00:54:52,463 --> 00:54:54,727
and fhey don't let defeat get them down.

691
00:54:54,799 --> 00:54:56,824
They remind me of Dignan in that way.

692
00:54:56,901 --> 00:55:01,361
Say what you will abouf him,
he's no cynic and he's no quitter.

693
00:55:01,439 --> 00:55:03,873
I'm usually so exhausted now
at the end of the day...

694
00:55:03,942 --> 00:55:06,433
so thaf I don't have time
fo think abouf blown opportunities...

695
00:55:06,511 --> 00:55:08,445
or wasted time.

696
00:55:08,513 --> 00:55:11,209
I do have one bif of advice
for you though, Grace.

697
00:55:11,282 --> 00:55:14,479
Take the fime in school
fo learn a foreign language.

698
00:55:14,552 --> 00:55:18,613
I myself never did,
and I feel I paid a price for it.

699
00:55:20,358 --> 00:55:22,121
Well, so long, Grace.

700
00:55:22,193 --> 00:55:25,287
I miss you very much.
Don'f forgef to write me back.

701
00:55:25,363 --> 00:55:26,796
Anthony."

702
00:55:26,865 --> 00:55:29,095
Okay, there he goes.

703
00:55:33,371 --> 00:55:35,236
It's Dignan. Wait up!

704
00:55:40,712 --> 00:55:42,373
Where are you going?

705
00:55:42,447 --> 00:55:45,075
I'm just walking Hector.

706
00:55:46,150 --> 00:55:48,311
How long you been back?

707
00:55:48,386 --> 00:55:50,149
A while.

708
00:55:50,221 --> 00:55:53,713
So how's it goin'?

709
00:55:53,791 --> 00:55:56,316
It's goin' pretty good.

710
00:56:02,834 --> 00:56:05,029
I wish that some of the stuff
that was said...

711
00:56:05,103 --> 00:56:08,971
hadn't been said out there by me...

712
00:56:09,040 --> 00:56:10,735
and...

713
00:56:10,808 --> 00:56:13,140
I'm sorry...

714
00:56:13,211 --> 00:56:14,644
about...

715
00:56:17,448 --> 00:56:19,780
Do you wanna shake hands?

716
00:56:28,927 --> 00:56:30,758
What's this you got on, man?

717
00:56:30,828 --> 00:56:33,296
It's a jumpsuit.

718
00:56:33,364 --> 00:56:35,628
You like it?
I ordered a dozen of them.

719
00:56:35,700 --> 00:56:38,100
Anthony, I'd like to introduce you
to Applejack.

720
00:56:38,169 --> 00:56:40,797
- Applejack, this is Anthony.
- Anthony Adams.

721
00:56:47,445 --> 00:56:49,174
Mr. Henry! It's Dignan!

722
00:56:50,114 --> 00:56:51,945
Got some visitors.

723
00:56:54,585 --> 00:56:56,712
- What time did he say he'd be here?
- Right now.

724
00:57:00,591 --> 00:57:02,889
Did you guys feel that?
I just felt something...

725
00:57:02,961 --> 00:57:04,861
Hey! Jesus Christ!

726
00:57:05,930 --> 00:57:08,694
How's the weather down there?

727
00:57:10,234 --> 00:57:12,828
- Come on in.
- Well, it's locked.

728
00:57:12,904 --> 00:57:15,338
- No, no. Come on, son.
- Okay.

729
00:57:15,406 --> 00:57:17,840
I just tried it,
but I'll try it again.

730
00:57:21,646 --> 00:57:23,671
Yes, it is!

731
00:57:25,583 --> 00:57:27,312
He poured more water on me.

732
00:57:30,355 --> 00:57:32,619
- Dignan, good to see you.
- Hi, Mr. Henry.

733
00:57:32,690 --> 00:57:34,487
Applejack, good to...

734
00:57:34,559 --> 00:57:36,493
And who are you?

735
00:57:38,629 --> 00:57:41,120
- That's Anthony...
- This is no good, bringing him here.

736
00:57:41,199 --> 00:57:44,066
What the shit, man?
What are you thinking?

737
00:57:44,135 --> 00:57:45,830
Are you out of your fuckin' mind?

738
00:57:47,939 --> 00:57:49,201
How are you?

739
00:57:50,808 --> 00:57:53,709
This is my business manager, Rowboat.

740
00:57:53,778 --> 00:57:56,576
Get you a little wet, did I, son?
Come on in, boys.

741
00:57:56,647 --> 00:57:58,581
There you go.

742
00:58:01,619 --> 00:58:03,883
That's it.
Give it a little topspin.

743
00:58:03,955 --> 00:58:05,752
A little more!

744
00:58:07,091 --> 00:58:08,558
Good. He listens.

745
00:58:09,861 --> 00:58:12,921
- This kid in?
- I don't know. Are you in?

746
00:58:17,268 --> 00:58:17,301
- You don't understand.
- Let me tell you about this job.

747
00:58:17,301 --> 00:58:19,098
- You don't understand.
- Let me tell you about this job.

748
00:58:19,170 --> 00:58:22,105
I got this program
and I'm trying to stick to it, okay?

749
00:58:22,173 --> 00:58:24,107
Just hear me out.

750
00:58:25,943 --> 00:58:29,743
It's called Hinckley Cold Storage.
Here are a few of the key ingredients:

751
00:58:29,814 --> 00:58:33,341
dynamite, pole vaulting,
laughing gas, choppers...

752
00:58:33,418 --> 00:58:37,115
Can you see how incredible
this is going to be? Come on!

753
00:58:37,188 --> 00:58:39,122
I can't do it.

754
00:58:41,292 --> 00:58:44,455
I know, but if he doesn't have
the enthusiasm, then who needs him?

755
00:58:44,529 --> 00:58:47,362
Oh, you said a mouthful.

756
00:58:47,432 --> 00:58:49,764
If you want, I could speak to him.

757
00:58:49,834 --> 00:58:52,064
Would you, Mr. Henry?
That'd be great.

758
00:58:52,136 --> 00:58:55,105
- Sugar cone?
- You bet.

759
00:58:55,173 --> 00:58:57,266
- Do you want anything, Anthony?
- No, thanks.

760
00:58:59,577 --> 00:59:02,546
Listen.

761
00:59:02,613 --> 00:59:05,776
You know...

762
00:59:05,850 --> 00:59:08,182
you're breaking his heart,
you know that, don't you?

763
00:59:09,854 --> 00:59:13,585
What do you mean?

764
00:59:13,658 --> 00:59:16,422
Kid that worked
on one of my garden crews...

765
00:59:16,494 --> 00:59:19,861
I mean, nice fella,
but he didn't perform.

766
00:59:19,931 --> 00:59:22,399
So I had to fire him.

767
00:59:22,467 --> 00:59:24,332
Then six months later...

768
00:59:25,403 --> 00:59:28,634
I get a call from a gas station...

769
00:59:28,706 --> 00:59:30,731
about 200 miles
outside of Victoria there.

770
00:59:30,808 --> 00:59:33,606
I said, "What the hell
are you doing out there?"

771
00:59:33,678 --> 00:59:35,270
But there's something in his voice.

772
00:59:35,346 --> 00:59:37,678
You know what I'm saying?

773
00:59:37,748 --> 00:59:41,013
I felt for him.
I mean, poor guy.

774
00:59:41,085 --> 00:59:43,713
Here he is, he thought he had a team.

775
00:59:43,788 --> 00:59:46,586
Turns out to be a man alone.

776
00:59:47,658 --> 00:59:50,388
And that's tough, man.
Real tough.

777
00:59:50,461 --> 00:59:52,292
Here you go.

778
01:00:10,448 --> 01:00:13,474
- Had any time to think?
- Yeah, I've done a lot of thinking.

779
01:00:29,233 --> 01:00:31,667
We're still holding
your position open for you.

780
01:00:31,736 --> 01:00:33,931
Yeah, I wish you wouldn't do that.

781
01:00:34,005 --> 01:00:37,168
- Come on. Go for a ride.
- It's too small for the both of us.

782
01:00:37,241 --> 01:00:39,471
No it isn't. Jump on.
I'll give you a pump.

783
01:00:39,544 --> 01:00:42,945
- Where'd you get this?
- I got it from a fr...

784
01:00:50,188 --> 01:00:51,712
What are you wearing?

785
01:00:51,789 --> 01:00:53,620
It's a jumpsuit.

786
01:00:53,691 --> 01:00:56,922
- Clay, look at this guy.
- He looks like a rodeo clown.

787
01:00:56,994 --> 01:00:59,360
He looks like a little banana.
Where are you from anyway, man?

788
01:00:59,430 --> 01:01:01,591
I'm from around here.

789
01:01:01,666 --> 01:01:03,156
- He used to mow our lawn.
- No shit?

790
01:01:03,234 --> 01:01:07,261
He was great... clipping the hedges,
sweeping up, mowing the lawn.

791
01:01:09,073 --> 01:01:11,803
What was the name
of your little lawn mowing company?

792
01:01:11,876 --> 01:01:13,468
The Lawn Wranglers.

793
01:01:15,880 --> 01:01:17,472
Let's go.

794
01:01:19,750 --> 01:01:21,809
Keep up the mowing, kemo sabe.

795
01:01:26,591 --> 01:01:29,651
It was landscaping, not just mowing.

796
01:01:29,727 --> 01:01:31,319
Man, don't listen to that guy.

797
01:01:31,395 --> 01:01:33,420
I don't know.
Sometimes l...

798
01:01:33,497 --> 01:01:35,590
I'm not always as confident as I look.

799
01:01:35,666 --> 01:01:38,032
- Did you see what he had on?
- Yeah.

800
01:01:38,102 --> 01:01:40,161
It was pretty cool.

801
01:01:41,739 --> 01:01:43,434
All right.

802
01:01:44,508 --> 01:01:46,442
Wait a second.

803
01:01:49,180 --> 01:01:51,045
What?

804
01:01:57,588 --> 01:02:01,820
Goddamn it. I'm in.

805
01:02:03,027 --> 01:02:05,689
- What?
- I'm in.

806
01:02:05,763 --> 01:02:07,754
I knew you'd be back.

807
01:02:07,832 --> 01:02:09,766
Three conditions.

808
01:02:09,834 --> 01:02:12,769
One: you mastermind the plan.

809
01:02:15,139 --> 01:02:17,869
Two: Bob's on the team.

810
01:02:17,942 --> 01:02:20,001
Let's hear the third one.

811
01:02:25,182 --> 01:02:27,309
You gotta get me one of these jumpsuits.

812
01:02:27,385 --> 01:02:28,818
- You like these?
- Yeah!

813
01:02:28,886 --> 01:02:31,354
Done. Deal. All right.

814
01:02:31,422 --> 01:02:34,585
- You're doing the right thing.
- Yeah, I know I am.

815
01:02:34,659 --> 01:02:37,287
All right. I'll see you later on.

816
01:02:40,398 --> 01:02:43,731
- Need any help?
- No, I think I got it.

817
01:02:51,309 --> 01:02:53,038
Ha-ha! Got the eye.

818
01:02:57,982 --> 01:03:00,382
Got the eye again.

819
01:03:04,755 --> 01:03:07,349
Well, move back a little bit!

820
01:03:07,425 --> 01:03:09,757
Hi, guys.
Welcome back.

821
01:03:09,827 --> 01:03:13,228
- He's back, Mr. Henry.
- Where's Bob? The rich kid?

822
01:03:14,665 --> 01:03:17,190
- Hey, what do you say?
- How's it goin'?

823
01:03:17,268 --> 01:03:19,327
Dignan! What do you say?
Come on in.

824
01:03:19,403 --> 01:03:21,633
- Oh, nothing much.
- What are you guys drinking?

825
01:03:21,706 --> 01:03:24,800
- Water for me, please.
- I'll have a Tom Collins, please.

826
01:03:24,875 --> 01:03:26,399
Tom Collins. Okay.

827
01:03:26,477 --> 01:03:29,571
I want you to know it was really too bad
about what happened out there.

828
01:03:29,647 --> 01:03:31,945
- I'm glad to see you.
- Yeah, it was unfortunate.

829
01:03:32,016 --> 01:03:34,211
- Let's not even talk about it.
- It was stupid.

830
01:03:34,285 --> 01:03:36,185
It was real stupid.
It was extremely stupid.

831
01:03:36,253 --> 01:03:39,620
I want you to know
I don't expect an apology.

832
01:03:39,690 --> 01:03:42,386
Can you believe this guy?
"I don't expect an apology."

833
01:03:42,460 --> 01:03:46,055
- Let's not get into this.
- Of course you don't wanna get into it.

834
01:03:46,130 --> 01:03:48,291
You would have let my brother
rot in fucking jail!

835
01:03:48,366 --> 01:03:51,460
- You said 48 hours!
- I never agreed to that.

836
01:03:51,535 --> 01:03:54,333
- That's a lie!
- Bullshit!

837
01:03:54,405 --> 01:03:56,965
- Backyard! Right now! Let's go!
- Just wait here.

838
01:03:57,041 --> 01:04:02,138
- Come on, Bob.
- Backyard? This is my house, asshole!

839
01:04:02,213 --> 01:04:03,874
- Get out here!
- Wait a second!

840
01:04:03,948 --> 01:04:07,111
I know you're feeling angry
and I think the thing to do is...

841
01:04:07,184 --> 01:04:09,152
- We're all here. Let's talk.
- Wait a second!

842
01:04:09,220 --> 01:04:12,314
Bob is a big boy.
Now, we are in the real world.

843
01:04:12,390 --> 01:04:16,383
We don't settle problems with hugs. We
settle them with bare-knuckle tactics.

844
01:04:16,460 --> 01:04:19,657
Let's talk about that.
????????

845
01:04:19,730 --> 01:04:21,891
- Fine!
- Bob, stay there!

846
01:04:21,966 --> 01:04:25,367
- In my own house?
- Stop it!

847
01:04:26,537 --> 01:04:29,233
Just stop!

848
01:04:29,306 --> 01:04:32,742
- You got me with a left hook.
- Okay, no more fighting.

849
01:04:32,810 --> 01:04:34,573
Bob, come here.

850
01:04:34,645 --> 01:04:36,943
I'm gonna hug him.

851
01:04:38,883 --> 01:04:41,511
What are we doing out here?
What happened?

852
01:04:41,585 --> 01:04:42,984
Man!

853
01:04:43,053 --> 01:04:46,352
- You went crazy.
- I know. I just... I don't know.

854
01:04:46,424 --> 01:04:48,551
- Come here.
- I was looking forward to seeing you.

855
01:04:48,626 --> 01:04:52,494
Bob, we'd like to have you on the team,
if you'II have us.

856
01:04:52,563 --> 01:04:56,090
Roberto, let me get something straight.

857
01:04:56,167 --> 01:04:59,159
- You don't play any tennis.
- No.

858
01:04:59,236 --> 01:05:03,263
- And you don't play any golf.
- No.

859
01:05:03,340 --> 01:05:05,831
So why do you belong to a country club?

860
01:05:07,411 --> 01:05:09,208
You got me.

861
01:05:09,280 --> 01:05:11,077
You're a piece of work.

862
01:05:11,148 --> 01:05:14,015
- The food is very good.
- Well, yeah. You just sign.

863
01:05:14,084 --> 01:05:16,644
My work is the finger work.

864
01:05:16,720 --> 01:05:18,654
Usually my work is...

865
01:05:19,723 --> 01:05:22,817
Little sound and good touch.

866
01:05:22,893 --> 01:05:24,952
- How you doin', Bob?
- Hey, Jackson.

867
01:05:25,029 --> 01:05:27,589
When will your folks
be back in town?

868
01:05:27,665 --> 01:05:30,327
That's hard to say.
Last I heard they were in Singapore.

869
01:05:30,401 --> 01:05:34,235
Your brother was up here the other day.
He said you ran away from home.

870
01:05:34,305 --> 01:05:36,034
- What?
- You ran away from home.

871
01:05:36,106 --> 01:05:37,903
Oh, shit.

872
01:05:38,943 --> 01:05:43,437
- I'll see you.
- Hi, guys. Bob, fancy seeing you here.

873
01:05:43,514 --> 01:05:45,379
The rest of the gang?

874
01:05:45,449 --> 01:05:47,212
- Hi, John Mapplethorpe.
- Kumar.

875
01:05:47,284 --> 01:05:48,876
Nice to meet you.

876
01:05:50,454 --> 01:05:53,048
Applejack, nice to meet you.

877
01:05:53,123 --> 01:05:56,388
- John, great pleasure to meet you.
- And your name is?

878
01:05:56,460 --> 01:05:59,224
Jackson said you told him
I ran away from home.

879
01:05:59,296 --> 01:06:01,389
I might have mentioned it.

880
01:06:01,465 --> 01:06:03,933
I'm 26 years old.
I didn't run away from home.

881
01:06:04,001 --> 01:06:07,061
Oh, that's right.
You're on that top secret mission.

882
01:06:07,137 --> 01:06:10,038
I'm sorry. I forgot I wasn't
supposed to say anything.

883
01:06:11,709 --> 01:06:14,678
I'd appreciate it if you didn't
run around telling lies about me.

884
01:06:14,745 --> 01:06:17,009
I'm sorry. I apologize.

885
01:06:17,081 --> 01:06:20,573
I know you have a reputation to uphold.

886
01:06:20,651 --> 01:06:23,313
It won't happen again.

887
01:06:23,387 --> 01:06:26,049
- Jonathan.
- Yeah?

888
01:06:28,893 --> 01:06:30,724
You know, Jonathan...

889
01:06:31,695 --> 01:06:34,858
the world needs dreamers.

890
01:06:34,932 --> 01:06:36,923
- Excuse me?
- No, I don't think so.

891
01:06:38,302 --> 01:06:41,738
You know, one day I believe
that you're gonna wake up...

892
01:06:41,805 --> 01:06:44,069
and realize you no longer
have a brother...

893
01:06:44,141 --> 01:06:47,042
and you no longer have any friends,
and on that day...

894
01:06:47,111 --> 01:06:50,911
I'm gonna be standing front and center
just laughing my fuckin' head off.

895
01:07:00,357 --> 01:07:01,790
God!

896
01:07:03,294 --> 01:07:05,285
I'm just messin' around with my brother.

897
01:07:05,362 --> 01:07:07,057
- Are we okay here?
- Okay.

898
01:07:16,674 --> 01:07:18,835
I hope this doesn't offend you, Bob...

899
01:07:19,910 --> 01:07:22,242
but your brother's a cocksucker.

900
01:07:22,313 --> 01:07:23,803
- I know.
- Did I offend you?

901
01:07:23,881 --> 01:07:26,247
- That didn't offend me.
- Good.

902
01:07:37,995 --> 01:07:41,260
Well, welcome
I've gof a beautiful house

903
01:07:42,333 --> 01:07:46,929
Hispanic male, nonsmoker,
enters white van, southwest door.

904
01:07:47,004 --> 01:07:49,063
- Mark that down.
- I did.

905
01:07:50,140 --> 01:07:53,769
There you go.
Drive away, just like you always do.

906
01:07:57,715 --> 01:08:00,878
We got it, man. We know it backwards,
and we know it forewords...

907
01:08:00,951 --> 01:08:03,545
because we've done the legwork,
and we've done the research.

908
01:08:03,621 --> 01:08:05,782
And now it pays off tomorrow.

909
01:08:05,856 --> 01:08:08,586
- Just gotta follow through.
- What are you working on?

910
01:08:08,659 --> 01:08:10,593
Let me show you this.

911
01:08:11,929 --> 01:08:14,329
Wow, that's one of your little drawings.

912
01:08:14,398 --> 01:08:17,731
There he goes... pole vaults over the
thing. There he goes, and there he is.

913
01:08:17,801 --> 01:08:21,168
I love the drawings. I love it.
You're creative.

914
01:08:21,238 --> 01:08:23,900
Tell me something.

915
01:08:24,975 --> 01:08:26,909
What do you think of Inez?

916
01:08:26,977 --> 01:08:29,377
- As a person?
- Yeah, as a girl.

917
01:08:31,048 --> 01:08:33,482
I liked her.

918
01:08:33,550 --> 01:08:36,383
I thought she was a good person.
She was friendly.

919
01:08:36,453 --> 01:08:40,048
She was attractive. I didn't get
to know her as well as you did.

920
01:08:40,124 --> 01:08:42,524
That's the only reason
I even bother to hesitate.

921
01:08:42,593 --> 01:08:46,393
That kid Rocky struck me
as kind of a weirdo.

922
01:08:46,463 --> 01:08:48,590
What? Rocky?

923
01:08:48,666 --> 01:08:50,600
- I mean, he said he loved you.
- What?

924
01:08:50,668 --> 01:08:52,363
Yeah, he said he loved you.

925
01:08:52,436 --> 01:08:54,427
- Was he...
- I mean, that just seemed strange.

926
01:08:54,505 --> 01:08:56,302
Was he translating?

927
01:08:58,042 --> 01:09:01,443
Was he translating for me
when he said he loved you?

928
01:09:01,512 --> 01:09:03,446
He said he loved you.

929
01:09:04,648 --> 01:09:06,582
He wasn't translating.
That's how I understood him.

930
01:09:06,650 --> 01:09:10,313
He was talking in English.
I was like, "What? Okay. l..."

931
01:09:10,387 --> 01:09:12,321
Whoa! Anthony, where are you going?

932
01:09:12,389 --> 01:09:15,916
He's just a mixed-up kid!
Anthony, come on!

933
01:09:15,993 --> 01:09:18,894
You're blowing our cover.
Maybe I didn't understand him.

934
01:09:18,962 --> 01:09:21,328
I'm calling for a motel.
I don't know the area code.

935
01:09:21,398 --> 01:09:23,229
I just know the name of the motel.

936
01:09:23,300 --> 01:09:27,100
- Listen, can I borrow him a minute?
- All right. Sure.

937
01:09:27,171 --> 01:09:29,105
I was thinking.

938
01:09:29,173 --> 01:09:32,404
It might give you a feeling of security
if I went in there with you tomorrow.

939
01:09:32,476 --> 01:09:34,808
You know, just for backup.

940
01:09:34,878 --> 01:09:37,608
- Huh, Chicky?
- Oh, that's right.

941
01:09:37,681 --> 01:09:40,047
Well, I mean, it couldn't hurt,
could it?

942
01:09:40,117 --> 01:09:42,813
No, it couldn't hurt, but...

943
01:09:44,455 --> 01:09:48,186
You gotta weigh the pros and cons.
You're the one who hipped me to that.

944
01:09:48,258 --> 01:09:50,658
Shoot, well, what are the cons?

945
01:09:50,728 --> 01:09:53,492
Cons... if you go in there tomorrow...

946
01:09:53,564 --> 01:09:56,533
then it's just another score
by Abe Henry.

947
01:09:56,600 --> 01:09:58,329
That's true.

948
01:10:00,037 --> 01:10:02,437
Can I speak to Inez, please?

949
01:10:02,506 --> 01:10:06,442
She's one of the housekeepers.
She worked there for a while.

950
01:10:06,510 --> 01:10:08,535
Please don't do this to me, ma'am.

951
01:10:08,612 --> 01:10:10,603
Look, I'll... Let me see what I can do.

952
01:10:10,681 --> 01:10:13,149
Well, it's your decision.

953
01:10:14,718 --> 01:10:16,709
If it's okay with you...

954
01:10:17,788 --> 01:10:20,018
it would mean a lot to me...

955
01:10:20,090 --> 01:10:22,786
if you'd let me try this one alone.

956
01:10:22,860 --> 01:10:25,192
Damn. I'II tell you something, kid.

957
01:10:25,262 --> 01:10:27,992
You've got the guts of a damn lion.

958
01:10:28,932 --> 01:10:30,422
Housekeeping.

959
01:10:30,501 --> 01:10:32,492
Carmen, how's it goin'?

960
01:10:32,569 --> 01:10:35,129
Yeah, I'm looking for Inez.
Have you seen her today? Is she in?

961
01:10:36,206 --> 01:10:38,140
She's not here.

962
01:10:38,208 --> 01:10:40,472
Hey, man. How's it goin'?

963
01:10:53,290 --> 01:10:54,222
Hello.

964
01:10:54,291 --> 01:10:57,818
I'm looking for Inez.
She's one of the housekeepers.

965
01:10:58,896 --> 01:11:01,831
- She is?
- Yeah, she is. Hold on.

966
01:11:08,038 --> 01:11:10,472
- It's for you. Telephone.
- Thank you.

967
01:11:17,314 --> 01:11:20,750
Yes!
She recognizes my voice!

968
01:11:22,386 --> 01:11:24,980
No, I'm at a party.

969
01:11:25,055 --> 01:11:27,285
God, you sound terrific.
How are you?

970
01:11:28,659 --> 01:11:31,184
That's great!

971
01:11:31,261 --> 01:11:33,661
No, I'm great,
especially now that I got you.

972
01:11:33,730 --> 01:11:37,029
I've been looking all over for you.
I talked to every person at the hotel.

973
01:11:37,100 --> 01:11:39,068
When am I going to see you?

974
01:11:40,470 --> 01:11:42,904
Gosh, your English is really improving.

975
01:11:42,973 --> 01:11:46,067
- It sounds... You're fluent now, Inez!
- Thank you.

976
01:11:47,010 --> 01:11:49,604
So the word on the street...

977
01:11:49,680 --> 01:11:51,841
Or should I say...

978
01:11:51,915 --> 01:11:55,351
rumor has if thaf, well...

979
01:11:57,020 --> 01:11:58,715
I heard you love me.

980
01:12:01,625 --> 01:12:03,786
Yes, I do.

981
01:12:03,861 --> 01:12:07,228
Yes!

982
01:12:07,297 --> 01:12:10,232
God, Inez!

983
01:12:33,223 --> 01:12:34,747
Bird Dog to Scarecrow.

984
01:12:36,026 --> 01:12:39,154
- Come in.
- Go ahead, Bird Dog.

985
01:12:39,229 --> 01:12:42,255
I got a visual read on you.
You're all clear.

986
01:12:42,332 --> 01:12:44,960
Outstanding, Bird Dog.
Outstanding. Stand by.

987
01:12:45,035 --> 01:12:47,060
Let's go!

988
01:12:47,137 --> 01:12:48,934
Kumar, are you ready?

989
01:12:49,006 --> 01:12:50,667
- Yes.
- Let's get lucky!

990
01:12:54,578 --> 01:12:57,138
Everybody move! Let's go!
Keep up the intensity!

991
01:12:58,282 --> 01:13:00,307
Come on!

992
01:13:00,384 --> 01:13:02,011
Scarecrow?

993
01:13:02,085 --> 01:13:05,521
- Come in, Jackknife.
- Is everything all right up there, man?

994
01:13:05,589 --> 01:13:08,820
Affirmative. We're approaching
the elevator right now on my left.

995
01:13:08,892 --> 01:13:11,053
- Stand by. Come in, Bird Dog.
- Copy.

996
01:13:11,128 --> 01:13:14,564
- Move you your second position. Fast!
- I'm moving.

997
01:13:17,734 --> 01:13:21,363
You guys take the elevator.
I'm gonna secure the stairway.

998
01:13:21,438 --> 01:13:23,736
- Kumar, are you okay?
- Yeah.

999
01:13:23,807 --> 01:13:27,038
I'm heading up the stairway. Everything
looks good. I just hit my knee!

1000
01:13:27,110 --> 01:13:29,908
Testing! Kumar!

1001
01:13:29,980 --> 01:13:33,211
What? I'm okay.

1002
01:13:33,283 --> 01:13:35,217
Stop! Get it down! Go!

1003
01:13:37,955 --> 01:13:40,253
Let's go. Go.
Where are you goin'? Come here.

1004
01:13:40,324 --> 01:13:42,884
Rendezvous at the checkpoint
in six minutes.

1005
01:13:42,960 --> 01:13:45,258
Checkpoint!

1006
01:13:45,329 --> 01:13:48,162
- Who's that man?
- What do you mean?

1007
01:13:48,231 --> 01:13:50,165
That's Applejack! Come on!

1008
01:13:59,643 --> 01:14:01,907
- Where we are going?
- Right down the corridor here.

1009
01:14:01,979 --> 01:14:04,072
- Are you nervous?
- Yes, I am nervous.

1010
01:14:08,151 --> 01:14:09,914
There it is. Oh, boy.

1011
01:14:09,987 --> 01:14:11,682
That's perfect.

1012
01:14:16,960 --> 01:14:18,222
No problem.

1013
01:14:18,295 --> 01:14:20,593
Hey, Jackknife, come in.

1014
01:14:20,664 --> 01:14:23,394
- Yeah.
- You know somethin'?

1015
01:14:23,467 --> 01:14:24,900
What?

1016
01:14:29,339 --> 01:14:31,273
I really don't wanna do this robbery.

1017
01:14:31,341 --> 01:14:34,572
- You know?
- Man, neither do I.

1018
01:14:34,644 --> 01:14:38,637
- Do you wanf me to come up there?
- Keep this line clear at all times.

1019
01:14:38,715 --> 01:14:40,546
Come on. Any activity, Bird Dog?

1020
01:14:40,617 --> 01:14:42,448
Negatory. We're all clear.

1021
01:14:42,519 --> 01:14:44,714
Good. lf's supposed to be.

1022
01:14:44,788 --> 01:14:47,416
I got a pretfy spectacular view
from up here.

1023
01:14:47,491 --> 01:14:52,588
I can see the whole city from the east
side all fhe way to the west side.

1024
01:14:52,662 --> 01:14:55,153
Anthony, the elevator's moving.

1025
01:14:55,232 --> 01:14:57,393
- Who's on the elevator?
- I don't know.

1026
01:14:57,467 --> 01:14:59,833
Well, check it!
It's moving right now!

1027
01:15:11,715 --> 01:15:14,479
Bob, what are you doing?

1028
01:15:14,551 --> 01:15:16,781
- My walkie-talkie busted.
- Give it to me!

1029
01:15:16,853 --> 01:15:19,583
- Did you drop it? Come on!
- No, I didn't drop it!

1030
01:15:19,656 --> 01:15:21,590
You're supposed to be
on the loading dock!

1031
01:15:21,658 --> 01:15:24,627
You go down there.
I'm by myself down there!

1032
01:15:26,329 --> 01:15:28,729
- Move it!
- What's going on?

1033
01:15:28,799 --> 01:15:30,892
It was Bob.
He dropped his walkie-talkie.

1034
01:15:30,967 --> 01:15:33,834
Who's watching the door?
Get back in position, assholes!

1035
01:15:38,475 --> 01:15:40,966
Applejack, talk to me.
What's going on?

1036
01:15:41,044 --> 01:15:42,944
Somebody's coming out of there.

1037
01:15:43,013 --> 01:15:44,810
- Look!
- Jesus Christ!

1038
01:15:44,881 --> 01:15:46,644
Hold it right there, guys!

1039
01:15:46,716 --> 01:15:47,944
- Freeze!
- Come this way.

1040
01:15:48,018 --> 01:15:50,043
Come here! Up against this wall!
Come here!

1041
01:15:50,120 --> 01:15:52,111
Up against this wall! Move!

1042
01:15:52,189 --> 01:15:54,589
- Move!
- Right here!

1043
01:15:54,658 --> 01:15:56,683
- Just look at the ceiling.
- Up against the wall!

1044
01:15:56,760 --> 01:15:58,523
- What are you doing here?
- We work here!

1045
01:15:58,595 --> 01:16:00,961
- You're always at lunch now!
- Not always.

1046
01:16:01,031 --> 01:16:04,489
Yes, always!
Okay, let me think.

1047
01:16:04,568 --> 01:16:07,196
Time!

1048
01:16:07,270 --> 01:16:08,828
Hold on! Jesus!

1049
01:16:08,905 --> 01:16:12,534
- What the hell are you doing here?
- My walkie-talkie broke, man.

1050
01:16:12,609 --> 01:16:14,201
- Two minutes.
- Good.

1051
01:16:14,277 --> 01:16:17,212
- Put on your masks!
- They've already seen our faces, Dignan!

1052
01:16:17,280 --> 01:16:18,713
Put on your masks!

1053
01:16:18,782 --> 01:16:22,309
Kumar, we've got problems.
What are you doing sitting down?

1054
01:16:22,385 --> 01:16:25,946
- I tried. I could not get it.
- You can't get it?

1055
01:16:26,022 --> 01:16:28,320
- No, I could not do it.
- Come on, man!

1056
01:16:28,391 --> 01:16:30,689
Bob, will you please put the mask on.

1057
01:16:30,760 --> 01:16:32,159
- Or turn away.
- I can't get it on!

1058
01:16:32,229 --> 01:16:33,787
Dignan, what's goin' on?

1059
01:16:33,864 --> 01:16:37,391
- Where's Kumar?
- Forget it, then. Just forget it!

1060
01:16:37,467 --> 01:16:40,459
You can't do it, because you
never knew how in the first place!

1061
01:16:40,537 --> 01:16:42,232
You are totally lost out here!

1062
01:16:43,607 --> 01:16:45,700
- What are you guys doin' here?
- Hold it!

1063
01:16:45,775 --> 01:16:49,267
- Who are these guys?
- Jesus!

1064
01:16:50,981 --> 01:16:53,506
- Jesus, Bob! What the hell...?
- Put it down, big guy!

1065
01:16:53,583 --> 01:16:56,245
- What is your problem?
- I didn't do anything!

1066
01:16:57,320 --> 01:17:00,756
- Are you okay?
- Did you shoot him?

1067
01:17:00,824 --> 01:17:03,190
He must be having a heart attack
or something!

1068
01:17:03,260 --> 01:17:04,852
Drop your smoke.
Let's go!

1069
01:17:04,928 --> 01:17:06,327
Come on!

1070
01:17:09,833 --> 01:17:12,393
Check his pulse!

1071
01:17:13,670 --> 01:17:16,070
- Check his pulse!
- Get to the elevator!

1072
01:17:16,139 --> 01:17:18,437
- I can't see.
- A little more!

1073
01:17:18,508 --> 01:17:20,066
I can't believe this!

1074
01:17:20,143 --> 01:17:23,772
- I didn't shoot him.
- He's got a bum ticker, man!

1075
01:17:23,847 --> 01:17:26,714
Hang in there, man.
Hang in there.

1076
01:17:26,783 --> 01:17:29,411
Prop him up. Come on.
Get him up there.

1077
01:17:29,486 --> 01:17:32,046
- Get up. Come on, man.
- He don't look good.

1078
01:17:33,523 --> 01:17:35,320
- What is this?
- Stay calm. Stay where you are.

1079
01:17:35,392 --> 01:17:39,795
- Who tripped the alarm, man?
- It's the fire alarm!

1080
01:17:39,863 --> 01:17:43,424
- Who tripped the fire alarm?
- It's because of all this fuckin' smoke!

1081
01:17:43,500 --> 01:17:45,764
Where's Kumar?

1082
01:17:49,806 --> 01:17:54,300
- We're going down. Let's go!
- Man, I blew it.

1083
01:17:54,377 --> 01:17:57,073
- I blew it, man.
- What were you doing in the freezer?

1084
01:17:57,147 --> 01:17:59,138
I don't know.
I lose my touch, man.

1085
01:17:59,216 --> 01:18:01,776
Did you ever have a touch to lose, man?

1086
01:18:01,851 --> 01:18:03,910
What were you doing in there?

1087
01:18:03,987 --> 01:18:06,046
Let's go!

1088
01:18:09,859 --> 01:18:12,327
- Wait for Kumar.
- Come on, Kumar!

1089
01:18:12,395 --> 01:18:14,329
Hurry up, Kumar!

1090
01:18:17,701 --> 01:18:19,669
- Open your door.
- I can't. It's locked.

1091
01:18:19,736 --> 01:18:21,260
- Open that door!
- Move!

1092
01:18:25,075 --> 01:18:27,043
- The elevator broke.
- What?

1093
01:18:28,144 --> 01:18:30,442
- Where's Applejack?
- He's stuck on the second floor!

1094
01:18:30,513 --> 01:18:32,981
- Between floors up there.
- Did he give you the keys?

1095
01:18:33,049 --> 01:18:35,347
- Applejack drove.
- What happened?

1096
01:18:35,418 --> 01:18:39,286
- I don't know.
- Run!

1097
01:18:39,356 --> 01:18:40,880
Go!

1098
01:18:40,957 --> 01:18:43,585
- What the hell happened to the plan?
- I don't know. Come on.

1099
01:18:43,660 --> 01:18:45,355
- I'll meet you at Bob's. Go!
- What?

1100
01:18:45,428 --> 01:18:47,919
- I gotta get Applejack.
- No, you're not.

1101
01:18:47,998 --> 01:18:49,932
- Yeah, I am.
- No!

1102
01:18:51,901 --> 01:18:54,267
- I gotta fly solo on this, baby.
- Okay, Dignan...

1103
01:18:54,337 --> 01:18:57,704
- I don't have time to argue now!
- I don't have time either!

1104
01:18:57,774 --> 01:19:00,538
Now, you get back to Bob's!
Just go!

1105
01:19:02,846 --> 01:19:04,871
Who is in charge here?

1106
01:19:04,948 --> 01:19:08,349
You are, you dumb son of a bitch!
Now, please leave!

1107
01:19:08,418 --> 01:19:10,648
Give me this one.

1108
01:19:10,720 --> 01:19:14,281
You gotta give me this one.

1109
01:19:14,357 --> 01:19:17,884
Dignan, you know what's gonna happen
if you go back there.

1110
01:19:18,962 --> 01:19:20,987
No, I don't.

1111
01:19:21,064 --> 01:19:23,555
They'll never catch me, man...

1112
01:19:23,633 --> 01:19:25,328
'cause I'm fuckin' innocent.

1113
01:20:09,779 --> 01:20:12,441
Get in here.
Concentrate on your breathing.

1114
01:20:12,515 --> 01:20:15,075
You gotta get oxygen to your heart.

1115
01:20:19,889 --> 01:20:22,619
I haven't got the keys.
Unlock the door!

1116
01:20:33,970 --> 01:20:36,234
Freeze! Don't move!

1117
01:20:36,306 --> 01:20:38,706
- Put your hands on the car!
- Put your hands up! Now!

1118
01:20:54,090 --> 01:20:56,285
Drop the gun!

1119
01:21:21,718 --> 01:21:23,709
- Freeze!
- Drop it!

1120
01:21:23,787 --> 01:21:25,721
Drop the gun!

1121
01:21:28,358 --> 01:21:30,519
Drop the gun!

1122
01:22:43,833 --> 01:22:45,733
Bob, there he is.

1123
01:22:53,076 --> 01:22:56,102
One month down, twenty-three to go.

1124
01:22:56,179 --> 01:22:58,010
Anyway, I said to the D. A:

1125
01:22:58,081 --> 01:23:01,278
"That cop who hit me
must have given me C.R.S. disease."

1126
01:23:01,351 --> 01:23:03,945
- What's that?
- That's just what the D.A. asked.

1127
01:23:04,020 --> 01:23:06,318
C.R.S. is a disease
where you can't remember shit.

1128
01:23:06,389 --> 01:23:08,186
- Like amnesia.
- Right.

1129
01:23:08,258 --> 01:23:11,227
C.R.S. "Can't remember shit." C.R.S.

1130
01:23:12,362 --> 01:23:14,592
- Tell Mr. Henry I said that.
- Okay.

1131
01:23:16,165 --> 01:23:19,032
So is Mr. Henry gonna come by
and see me or what?

1132
01:23:20,203 --> 01:23:22,137
I don't think so.

1133
01:23:22,205 --> 01:23:24,935
He actually robbed Bob's house.

1134
01:23:25,008 --> 01:23:27,203
- You're kidding?
- No, I'm not.

1135
01:23:27,277 --> 01:23:29,507
I can't believe that.

1136
01:23:29,579 --> 01:23:31,513
I almost robbed that place myself.

1137
01:23:34,217 --> 01:23:36,549
You think Applejack knew?

1138
01:23:36,619 --> 01:23:41,386
We haven't heard from Applejack
since he got out of the hospital.

1139
01:23:41,457 --> 01:23:43,550
His case got dismissed.

1140
01:23:43,626 --> 01:23:45,560
- What? Why?
- We're not sure.

1141
01:23:45,628 --> 01:23:47,721
We think Mr. Henry had something
to do with it.

1142
01:23:47,797 --> 01:23:51,597
Well, they take the health problems
into account.

1143
01:23:56,940 --> 01:24:01,036
- So what all did he get?
- Pretty much everything.

1144
01:24:01,110 --> 01:24:05,069
- I bet he got that grand piano.
- He got everything.

1145
01:24:05,148 --> 01:24:07,981
I bet that grand piano's
worth ten grand.

1146
01:24:12,488 --> 01:24:14,956
I'm sorry, Bob.

1147
01:24:16,059 --> 01:24:18,391
Yeah, but you know,
in a strange way...

1148
01:24:18,461 --> 01:24:21,521
it's brought me and Future Man
closer together.

1149
01:24:21,598 --> 01:24:25,967
I mean, we went out
to look for a new piano the other day...

1150
01:24:26,035 --> 01:24:29,198
and he looks at me and says:
"Bob, just because you're a fuck-up...

1151
01:24:29,272 --> 01:24:31,035
doesn't mean you're not my brother."

1152
01:24:36,179 --> 01:24:39,546
That kind of touched me.

1153
01:24:39,616 --> 01:24:41,811
He doesn't normally open up like that.

1154
01:24:44,387 --> 01:24:47,151
- Hey, I talked to Inez last night.
- Really?

1155
01:24:47,223 --> 01:24:49,851
Gonna be bringing you a care package
when she comes up here.

1156
01:24:49,926 --> 01:24:53,225
- No shit?
- Yeah.

1157
01:24:53,296 --> 01:24:57,392
She liked me.
Oh, yeah. Hang on to that one.

1158
01:24:57,467 --> 01:24:59,992
You want anything special?

1159
01:25:05,308 --> 01:25:07,868
Well...

1160
01:25:07,944 --> 01:25:10,572
- I got something for you guys.
- Oh, yeah?

1161
01:25:10,647 --> 01:25:13,081
Belt buckles that I made.

1162
01:25:13,149 --> 01:25:14,912
There's one for you and one for you.

1163
01:25:14,984 --> 01:25:18,647
I made a couple more
that I was gonna give...

1164
01:25:18,721 --> 01:25:20,655
to, you know, Applejack,
Kumar or Mr. Henry.

1165
01:25:20,723 --> 01:25:23,521
But... I don't know.
Maybe give it to Inez.

1166
01:25:23,593 --> 01:25:25,618
I don't care. Give it to those guys.

1167
01:25:25,695 --> 01:25:28,163
I don't have any hard feelings.

1168
01:25:28,231 --> 01:25:31,689
Here's a little piece.

1169
01:25:31,768 --> 01:25:33,702
That's for the tip.

1170
01:25:38,374 --> 01:25:40,569
- Thanks.
- We did it though, didn't we?

1171
01:25:44,914 --> 01:25:47,508
Yeah, we did it, all right.

1172
01:25:53,423 --> 01:25:56,017
Well, thank you for comin'.

1173
01:25:58,928 --> 01:26:00,520
It's good seein' you.

1174
01:26:04,333 --> 01:26:07,598
- Did you bring that grappling hook?
- Grappling hook?

1175
01:26:07,670 --> 01:26:09,729
I think I might have found
a way out of here.

1176
01:26:09,806 --> 01:26:12,240
- You're kidding!
- No, I'm not.

1177
01:26:12,308 --> 01:26:15,209
- How?
- Wait for my instructions.

1178
01:26:16,245 --> 01:26:18,941
When we go through the next gate, you'll
have 30 seconds to take out the guard.

1179
01:26:19,015 --> 01:26:20,073
- What?
- 30 seconds!

1180
01:26:20,149 --> 01:26:22,447
Have the car running
at the northwest checkpoint.

1181
01:26:22,518 --> 01:26:26,386
- Bob and I will scale the barricade.
- Hold on!

1182
01:26:26,456 --> 01:26:30,916
And Bob, remember, shield me from
the bullets! They won't shoot civilians!

1183
01:26:30,993 --> 01:26:32,790
- Are you ready?
- Hold on!

1184
01:26:32,862 --> 01:26:35,888
Let's go! Now!

1185
01:26:42,305 --> 01:26:45,672
Isn't it funny how you used to be
in the nuthouse and now I'm in jail?
