1
00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:37,986
Angelo!
My oldest, dearest friend.

2
00:00:38,110 --> 00:00:40,180
Your son!

3
00:00:40,670 --> 00:00:43,503
He lost his mother,
but he's got another father.

4
00:00:43,630 --> 00:00:45,666
I'm his father now, with you.

5
00:00:46,510 --> 00:00:52,824
I'll be as one with you,
protecting his future.

6
00:00:54,590 --> 00:00:57,058
We're honoured,
Don Padrone.

7
00:01:38,470 --> 00:01:42,224
Raise the first finger
of your right hand.

8
00:02:17,190 --> 00:02:23,584
This drop of blood symbolizes
your birth into our family.

9
00:02:23,710 --> 00:02:28,864
We're one,
until death.

10
00:02:29,470 --> 00:02:31,586
We'll protect you...

11
00:02:31,830 --> 00:02:34,742
so much you protect
Prizzi's honour.

12
00:02:35,550 --> 00:02:39,589
- Do you swear it?
- Yeah.

13
00:07:31,670 --> 00:07:34,742
Now that you have sealed a truly
Christian marriage...

14
00:07:34,870 --> 00:07:37,509
give these wedding rings to each
other saying after me:

15
00:07:38,630 --> 00:07:42,862
In the name of the Father and
of the Son and of the Holy Spirit...

16
00:07:43,550 --> 00:07:46,189
take and wear this ring...

17
00:07:46,270 --> 00:07:48,545
as a sign of my love...

18
00:07:48,630 --> 00:07:50,143
and fidelity.

19
00:07:50,710 --> 00:07:56,387
In the name of the Father and
of the Son and of the Holy Spirit...

20
00:07:56,470 --> 00:07:59,189
take and wear this ring...

21
00:07:59,310 --> 00:08:01,266
as a sign of my love...

22
00:08:01,390 --> 00:08:03,062
and fidelity.

23
00:08:03,310 --> 00:08:07,064
In the name of the Father and of
the Son and the Holy Spirit, Amen.

24
00:09:08,030 --> 00:09:10,863
Hey, you know that girl up there...

25
00:09:11,590 --> 00:09:14,866
blonde, lavender gloves?

26
00:09:14,990 --> 00:09:17,345
Look pal
I'd like to help you but.

27
00:09:17,510 --> 00:09:19,819
I gotta take shots of the notables,
the bishops...

28
00:09:19,910 --> 00:09:22,060
Mr. Partanna,
what can I do for you?

29
00:09:22,190 --> 00:09:24,943
I want shots of that girl up there
in the lavender gloves.

30
00:09:25,070 --> 00:09:27,300
You got it,
my pleasure.

31
00:09:29,550 --> 00:09:30,619
Take care of yourselves.

32
00:09:33,270 --> 00:09:35,022
Don't tell me that
was Charley Partanna.

33
00:09:35,310 --> 00:09:38,108
- Himself.
- Holy shit.

34
00:09:56,470 --> 00:09:59,507
Hey, give me a ride over
to the reception, will ya'?

35
00:09:59,830 --> 00:10:02,822
There's over half a dozen veal
steaks on the Prizzi meat counter.

36
00:10:02,950 --> 00:10:05,623
You got it Charley, jump in.

37
00:10:42,430 --> 00:10:44,864
Ok, quiet down!
Quiet down!

38
00:10:45,790 --> 00:10:49,226
Ladies and gentlemen,
my brother Eduardo and I...

39
00:10:49,590 --> 00:10:54,459
would like to introduce you to a man
who needs no introduction:

40
00:10:54,950 --> 00:10:57,145
Our father
your dear friend...

41
00:10:57,270 --> 00:11:00,228
a legend to his people:

42
00:11:00,710 --> 00:11:03,304
Don Corrado Prizzi.

43
00:11:17,150 --> 00:11:20,540
My father welcomes all of you
to this great family occasion...

44
00:11:20,670 --> 00:11:23,184
and he says that you should
all have a great time.

45
00:11:23,430 --> 00:11:24,783
He offers his toast of love...

46
00:11:24,870 --> 00:11:27,100
to the happiness of the bride
and groom...

47
00:11:27,750 --> 00:11:30,423
and he wishes them
many children.

48
00:11:32,870 --> 00:11:35,145
Thanks to you all.

49
00:12:21,990 --> 00:12:25,346
Excuse me would you care
to dance?

50
00:12:26,990 --> 00:12:28,343
Yes.

51
00:12:55,310 --> 00:12:57,665
Some spread, huh?

52
00:12:58,110 --> 00:12:59,862
Haven't I seen you
before?

53
00:13:00,430 --> 00:13:02,421
I'm sure I'd remember.

54
00:13:02,990 --> 00:13:03,979
I mean...

55
00:13:04,310 --> 00:13:06,949
maybe's you were at the marry
mountain with the bride...

56
00:13:09,350 --> 00:13:10,908
I could never miss you.

57
00:13:11,470 --> 00:13:12,698
And you are?

58
00:13:12,830 --> 00:13:15,469
Charley Partanna,
pleased to meet you.

59
00:13:15,910 --> 00:13:17,946
Miss, Miss!
Telephone lady!

60
00:13:18,270 --> 00:13:20,306
- Telephone?
- I'll be right back.

61
00:13:39,470 --> 00:13:41,347
Hello, Aunt Amalia!

62
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:46,662
Maerose!

63
00:13:46,830 --> 00:13:49,867
Pop actually invited me
to my own sisters wedding.

64
00:13:49,990 --> 00:13:51,821
Imagine that.

65
00:13:51,950 --> 00:13:54,384
He must be getting soft in his old age.

66
00:13:54,510 --> 00:13:56,740
Cara, let me look at ya'.

67
00:13:59,590 --> 00:14:01,342
So Aunt Amalia
what do you think?

68
00:14:01,470 --> 00:14:02,789
Such a one.

69
00:14:02,910 --> 00:14:05,265
Always making
a show of yourself.

70
00:14:05,390 --> 00:14:08,860
Come on Aunt Amalia,
I got a reputation to live up to.

71
00:14:08,990 --> 00:14:10,821
I'm the family scandal.

72
00:14:10,950 --> 00:14:13,384
Everybody be disappointed
if I stopped.

73
00:14:13,870 --> 00:14:16,782
Have you paid your respects
to your father yet?

74
00:14:24,710 --> 00:14:27,178
- Do I have to?
- Sure you have to.

75
00:14:27,510 --> 00:14:29,865
Come on, lets' go together.

76
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:36,705
Hello Pappa!

77
00:14:37,550 --> 00:14:39,745
Dominic! Dominic!

78
00:14:39,870 --> 00:14:41,622
She came to pay you her respects.

79
00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:42,899
Speak to her!

80
00:14:43,630 --> 00:14:45,860
Then how come she ain't
dressed right...

81
00:14:45,950 --> 00:14:47,622
If she's so respectful?

82
00:14:47,870 --> 00:14:50,668
How come she show's up
at a family wedding...

83
00:14:50,750 --> 00:14:52,581
dressed like a Badonna Dialo?

84
00:14:54,030 --> 00:14:57,306
Don't worry Aunt Amalia,
he'll get his one day.

85
00:14:58,190 --> 00:15:00,658
You ought to be ashamed
of yourself.

86
00:15:39,590 --> 00:15:43,219
Where's the lady
you took to the telephone?

87
00:15:44,150 --> 00:15:45,742
Where's the lady
you took to the telephone?

88
00:15:45,870 --> 00:15:47,781
How should I know mister?

89
00:15:48,070 --> 00:15:49,469
Who told you to go get her?

90
00:15:49,630 --> 00:15:52,303
Some old guy, I don't know.

91
00:15:52,950 --> 00:15:54,303
An old guy.

92
00:15:54,630 --> 00:15:55,665
Ok.
Here.

93
00:15:56,350 --> 00:15:58,147
Watch out for them conolli's.

94
00:15:58,630 --> 00:15:59,585
Thanks mister.

95
00:16:02,870 --> 00:16:04,303
Hello Charley.

96
00:16:04,590 --> 00:16:06,581
- Hi Maerose.
- Hi.

97
00:16:06,750 --> 00:16:10,106
- How are you Mae?
- Fine Charley, and you?

98
00:16:10,550 --> 00:16:12,347
Fine too.

99
00:16:13,670 --> 00:16:17,663
So how's the decorating
business?

100
00:16:17,790 --> 00:16:20,304
Oh, it's just great Charley,
we're always busy.

101
00:16:20,510 --> 00:16:22,148
Everything is art deco now.

102
00:16:22,270 --> 00:16:23,225
Art who?

103
00:16:23,590 --> 00:16:26,502
You know art deco,
after art nouveau.

104
00:16:26,630 --> 00:16:28,700
It's a style it's not a person.

105
00:16:30,110 --> 00:16:32,670
Like all that art stuff.

106
00:16:39,590 --> 00:16:40,989
God!
Damn!

107
00:16:43,230 --> 00:16:45,460
What's the matter Mae?

108
00:16:46,670 --> 00:16:48,786
I should have known to stay away.

109
00:16:48,910 --> 00:16:50,263
What happened?

110
00:16:52,070 --> 00:16:55,540
I went to say hello to my father,
and he called me a whore.

111
00:16:56,790 --> 00:16:59,509
Maerose, I'm sorry.

112
00:17:02,430 --> 00:17:05,547
Listen Mae what you gotta do
is forget about your father.

113
00:17:05,630 --> 00:17:07,063
Forget about the alignment.

114
00:17:07,150 --> 00:17:08,902
They never gonna take you back
anyway.

115
00:17:09,030 --> 00:17:11,225
So screw them.
They don't deserve you.

116
00:17:12,870 --> 00:17:16,783
Especially that fucking Dominic.

117
00:17:19,070 --> 00:17:21,504
Mae, you are still beautiful.

118
00:17:21,630 --> 00:17:25,589
Why don't you find yourself someone
who has nothing to do with the family?

119
00:17:25,830 --> 00:17:28,947
Settle down,
couple of kids.

120
00:17:29,150 --> 00:17:31,425
A life.

121
00:17:32,310 --> 00:17:34,426
Practice your meatballs.

122
00:17:36,950 --> 00:17:39,384
Sure Charley.
Thanks a lot.

123
00:17:39,470 --> 00:17:42,064
You're a big help.

124
00:18:00,670 --> 00:18:02,388
Are you the guy
who took the pictures?

125
00:18:02,470 --> 00:18:03,425
Yeah.

126
00:18:03,510 --> 00:18:06,070
- So when do I get to see them?
- They're in the lab, Mr. Partanna.

127
00:18:06,190 --> 00:18:08,260
I'll make sure I get them to you
as soon as they're out.

128
00:18:08,350 --> 00:18:09,499
About noon tomorrow.

129
00:18:09,710 --> 00:18:12,178
- Ok, meanwhile give me her name.
- Her name?

130
00:18:12,310 --> 00:18:17,384
- Yeah her name, for Christ's sake.
- Mr. Partanna I didn't get no name.

131
00:18:17,750 --> 00:18:19,263
I thought you knew her.

132
00:18:19,390 --> 00:18:20,709
Oh for Christ's sake's!

133
00:18:39,350 --> 00:18:41,341
- Hello.
- Mae.

134
00:18:41,470 --> 00:18:44,348
She ain't here.
You wanna leave a message?

135
00:18:45,950 --> 00:18:49,101
- Who is this?
- This is the girl.

136
00:18:49,390 --> 00:18:52,029
Ask her, this is very important.

137
00:18:52,710 --> 00:18:55,702
Ask her if she knows a woman
at the wedding...

138
00:18:55,830 --> 00:18:57,263
who wore a lavender dress.

139
00:18:57,390 --> 00:19:00,268
- You got it?
- I got it.

140
00:19:00,670 --> 00:19:02,740
Make sure she calls me.
You hear?

141
00:19:03,390 --> 00:19:06,905
Now what's your name?
I'm gonna send you ten bucks.

142
00:19:07,270 --> 00:19:10,626
Ten bucks?
Miss Peaches.

143
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:12,788
Ok, Peaches.

144
00:19:13,310 --> 00:19:15,619
You tell Miss Prizzi
she has to call me...

145
00:19:16,350 --> 00:19:18,227
no matter how late, tonight.

146
00:19:18,350 --> 00:19:21,148
- Ok.
- Peaches thank you.

147
00:19:21,270 --> 00:19:22,225
Bye, bye.

148
00:19:40,510 --> 00:19:42,944
Hey Partanna!

149
00:19:44,390 --> 00:19:46,028
Gallagher!
Homicide!

150
00:19:47,430 --> 00:19:49,261
What's up?

151
00:19:49,390 --> 00:19:51,620
Somebody tagged Sally
Turbino this afternoon.

152
00:19:52,270 --> 00:19:53,385
Yeah?

153
00:19:53,750 --> 00:19:54,865
Who dunnit?

154
00:19:55,030 --> 00:19:57,260
Where were you between
two and five today?

155
00:19:58,190 --> 00:19:59,748
I was at the wedding.

156
00:20:00,310 --> 00:20:02,744
Corrado Prizzi's
granddaughter's wedding.

157
00:20:04,510 --> 00:20:07,422
They're all gonna turn out
to be at the wedding.

158
00:20:07,950 --> 00:20:10,339
Come on!
We're taking you in!

159
00:20:22,590 --> 00:20:24,069
You couldn't be cleaner?

160
00:20:24,230 --> 00:20:26,698
- Who made the hit bob?
- We did.

161
00:20:26,910 --> 00:20:30,459
We did? How come we did?
I don't know nothing about it.

162
00:20:36,350 --> 00:20:38,864
Well that's the best way in it.

163
00:20:39,470 --> 00:20:41,028
Who hit him?

164
00:20:41,150 --> 00:20:43,664
I don't tell.
It was a specialist job.

165
00:20:43,790 --> 00:20:44,745
How come?

166
00:20:44,870 --> 00:20:48,340
Dominic told me to set it up so
he couldn't have nothing to do with it.

167
00:20:48,830 --> 00:20:50,707
We was all at the wedding.

168
00:21:02,510 --> 00:21:04,785
- Mae?
- Charley?

169
00:21:04,910 --> 00:21:06,343
Did you have any luck?

170
00:21:07,550 --> 00:21:09,347
What kind of a message was that?

171
00:21:09,430 --> 00:21:12,308
Who can remember
a girl in a lavender dress?

172
00:21:12,670 --> 00:21:15,787
I was wearing a pink and black
dress.

173
00:21:15,910 --> 00:21:19,869
So you don't know
who she is...

174
00:21:21,710 --> 00:21:24,463
the woman in the lavender dress?

175
00:21:24,870 --> 00:21:27,259
Oh, go suck your head!

176
00:21:37,470 --> 00:21:38,425
Yeah?

177
00:21:38,510 --> 00:21:41,547
Mr. Partanna please.
It's Irene Walker calling.

178
00:21:41,670 --> 00:21:42,705
What?

179
00:21:42,830 --> 00:21:45,298
- Is this Charley Partanna?
- Yeah, yeah.

180
00:21:45,430 --> 00:21:48,024
I hope you don't mind
my calling so late.

181
00:21:48,550 --> 00:21:51,986
I wanted to apologise for running
out the way I did this afternoon.

182
00:21:52,310 --> 00:21:55,461
This is you?
Irene walker?

183
00:21:56,790 --> 00:22:00,021
I recognise the voice,
but I didn't get your name before.

184
00:22:01,150 --> 00:22:02,742
I just wanted to explain.

185
00:22:02,870 --> 00:22:04,542
I hope you don't think I'm rude.

186
00:22:04,670 --> 00:22:08,549
Rude? Oh, no, no.
You could never be rude.

187
00:22:09,710 --> 00:22:12,019
So listen um.
Well...

188
00:22:12,830 --> 00:22:16,106
Why don't we get together later,
for like a late dinner?

189
00:22:17,110 --> 00:22:18,099
When you mean tonight?

190
00:22:18,230 --> 00:22:20,141
I could pick you up in half an hour.

191
00:22:20,270 --> 00:22:22,022
I live in California.

192
00:22:22,590 --> 00:22:23,864
California?

193
00:22:23,990 --> 00:22:26,584
Yeah, that's where I live.
I had to come home.

194
00:22:31,430 --> 00:22:33,068
How about lunch tomorrow?

195
00:22:34,110 --> 00:22:35,225
Alright.

196
00:22:35,630 --> 00:22:39,225
How about the bar
at the Bell Age hotel?

197
00:22:40,030 --> 00:22:43,466
That would be tremendous.
What time?

198
00:22:44,190 --> 00:22:46,340
- About two?
- Great.

199
00:23:10,550 --> 00:23:13,542
I was scared I was never
gonna see you again.

200
00:23:21,310 --> 00:23:23,540
Dos zumos de piña
con BacardÍ.

201
00:23:26,990 --> 00:23:28,184
What was that you said?

202
00:23:28,350 --> 00:23:31,103
I ordered us a drink
something I think you'll like.

203
00:23:32,510 --> 00:23:33,989
Say it again.

204
00:23:34,550 --> 00:23:36,700
Zumo de piña
con Bacardi.

205
00:23:37,110 --> 00:23:39,749
What is it some Puerto Rican
or something?

206
00:23:39,870 --> 00:23:43,943
Yes, I guess it could be.
Pineapple juice with rum.

207
00:23:44,350 --> 00:23:46,341
I had it in Cuba.

208
00:23:47,510 --> 00:23:49,580
What were you doing in Cuba?

209
00:23:49,990 --> 00:23:51,503
I was on my honeymoon.

210
00:23:54,710 --> 00:23:57,702
I didn't know you was married.

211
00:23:58,510 --> 00:24:00,501
My husband left me 4 years ago.

212
00:24:01,390 --> 00:24:03,950
I don't know where he's.
I don't wanna know.

213
00:24:04,510 --> 00:24:05,784
He left you!

214
00:24:06,990 --> 00:24:08,343
Crazy huh!

215
00:24:10,510 --> 00:24:12,740
I could find him for you.

216
00:24:13,430 --> 00:24:15,148
Let him stay lost!

217
00:24:16,270 --> 00:24:21,663
Well you might wanna
get married again someday.

218
00:24:22,270 --> 00:24:23,862
Maybe...

219
00:24:24,510 --> 00:24:26,182
but until that happens...

220
00:24:26,670 --> 00:24:28,865
I don't wanna know about him.

221
00:24:30,790 --> 00:24:33,145
What about you?
Are you married?

222
00:24:36,430 --> 00:24:38,625
Once I was almost married.

223
00:24:39,590 --> 00:24:41,262
Mae rose was her name.

224
00:24:42,750 --> 00:24:44,627
We grew up together.

225
00:24:47,590 --> 00:24:49,820
One night we had a big fight...

226
00:24:49,950 --> 00:24:52,180
because I was dancing too much
with another girl.

227
00:24:52,310 --> 00:24:54,665
I suppose I did it on purpose...

228
00:24:54,750 --> 00:24:56,263
because I wanted
to make her jealous.

229
00:24:58,110 --> 00:25:01,386
So she flew off to Mexico
with the guy.

230
00:25:01,910 --> 00:25:03,229
Shacks up in a hotel...

231
00:25:03,350 --> 00:25:07,059
Father sends some goons down there
to clobber the guy.

232
00:25:09,710 --> 00:25:13,498
Brings her back to the States and
don't let her back into his house.

233
00:25:13,670 --> 00:25:15,786
That was 4 years ago.

234
00:25:16,310 --> 00:25:17,379
That's it?

235
00:25:18,830 --> 00:25:20,946
Yeah, she can't even go
to Brooklyn any more.

236
00:25:21,030 --> 00:25:23,066
Only unless it's a special occasion...

237
00:25:23,190 --> 00:25:25,340
weddings, funerals,
stuff like that.

238
00:25:25,990 --> 00:25:28,026
We're still friends.

239
00:25:28,630 --> 00:25:30,825
She's in decorating.

240
00:25:30,950 --> 00:25:33,259
She did my apartment,
real nice job she did too.

241
00:25:35,510 --> 00:25:37,546
That's some family you got.

242
00:25:38,270 --> 00:25:41,148
Anyway...
I like you coat.

243
00:25:43,070 --> 00:25:46,858
Do you?
A coat like this...

244
00:25:46,990 --> 00:25:50,221
stand out in New York,
you know.

245
00:25:50,350 --> 00:25:53,228
My father always says
it's better...

246
00:25:53,350 --> 00:25:56,899
to stand out because
of how serious you are...

247
00:25:57,430 --> 00:26:00,945
instead of clothes, cars
or diamond rings...

248
00:26:02,070 --> 00:26:03,628
For men that is.

249
00:26:04,190 --> 00:26:06,260
What am I doing all
the talking here for?

250
00:26:06,430 --> 00:26:08,864
How come I met you
at a Prizzi's wedding...

251
00:26:08,990 --> 00:26:10,184
and you ain't no wop?

252
00:26:10,310 --> 00:26:13,188
The Bishop who married them
wasn't Italian.

253
00:26:14,310 --> 00:26:16,141
No he's a Polak.

254
00:26:16,590 --> 00:26:17,909
So am I.

255
00:26:18,830 --> 00:26:20,741
Walker is a Polak name?

256
00:26:20,950 --> 00:26:22,269
No, it was Walkervisks.

257
00:26:22,630 --> 00:26:23,619
I shortened it.

258
00:26:23,830 --> 00:26:26,139
My maiden name was
Irene Walkervisks.

259
00:26:27,190 --> 00:26:29,750
Either way...

260
00:26:30,630 --> 00:26:33,667
you're sure one
beautiful woman to me.

261
00:26:34,030 --> 00:26:38,421
I guess I thought that Walker sounded
more like a tax consultant should.

262
00:26:39,110 --> 00:26:40,702
You're a tax
consultant?

263
00:26:42,230 --> 00:26:44,539
What do you do
when you consult?

264
00:26:44,790 --> 00:26:46,701
I save people money.

265
00:26:46,830 --> 00:26:49,264
Show them the angles.
There are a lot of angles.

266
00:26:49,510 --> 00:26:51,341
This L. A corporation...

267
00:26:51,470 --> 00:26:53,825
had a guy kidnapped
in the Middle East...

268
00:26:53,950 --> 00:26:57,545
so I told them they ran some money
that was tax deductible staff loss.

269
00:26:57,630 --> 00:27:00,064
- Things like that.
- Terrific.

270
00:27:02,070 --> 00:27:03,549
Charley...

271
00:27:05,030 --> 00:27:07,908
- Shall we go?
- Oh, yeah, sure.

272
00:27:07,990 --> 00:27:10,185
We'll take my car.

273
00:27:12,110 --> 00:27:15,022
- What kind of a car is this?
- An Excaliber.

274
00:27:15,150 --> 00:27:17,618
Japanese make them in England
for the Arabian market.

275
00:27:17,710 --> 00:27:19,063
Great California car.

276
00:27:19,190 --> 00:27:24,548
It's a great anyplace car.
Jesus it must cost though huh?

277
00:27:24,670 --> 00:27:28,549
Well it wasn't free but
think what'll cost in two years.

278
00:27:28,710 --> 00:27:31,782
- Like to eat outside?
- Yeah.

279
00:27:37,990 --> 00:27:41,062
Irene I gotta say it.

280
00:27:41,270 --> 00:27:43,067
I can't sleep.

281
00:27:43,790 --> 00:27:46,702
I'm a grown man middle aged
maybe...

282
00:27:47,710 --> 00:27:48,825
but no...

283
00:27:49,710 --> 00:27:52,429
nobody in my life has ever
affected me anything...

284
00:27:52,510 --> 00:27:56,298
like the way that
you make me feel.

285
00:28:00,510 --> 00:28:01,829
I love you.

286
00:28:04,230 --> 00:28:07,540
That's it.
That's everything.

287
00:28:09,710 --> 00:28:11,029
I love you.

288
00:28:12,990 --> 00:28:15,629
I think I'm in love with you
too Charley.

289
00:28:15,950 --> 00:28:17,383
No it ain't in love.

290
00:28:17,510 --> 00:28:19,262
In love is temporary.

291
00:28:19,390 --> 00:28:21,779
Then you move on
to the next in love.

292
00:28:21,910 --> 00:28:25,141
Everybody is always falling
in and out of love.

293
00:28:25,310 --> 00:28:27,665
I notice.
I remember everything...

294
00:28:27,790 --> 00:28:30,543
I read about it in magazines.

295
00:28:30,750 --> 00:28:34,299
When you're just in love
it's just...

296
00:28:35,350 --> 00:28:36,863
Wait a minute.

297
00:28:38,270 --> 00:28:40,864
A hormonal secretion...

298
00:28:40,990 --> 00:28:42,981
which changes the senses smells.

299
00:28:43,110 --> 00:28:46,022
So as to affect someone
in a certain way.

300
00:28:46,510 --> 00:28:50,503
That's what in love is.
Who needs it.

301
00:28:51,190 --> 00:28:56,310
Love.
I mean, I love you

302
00:28:56,390 --> 00:29:00,383
I think that's sounds
like I'm hedging, but...

303
00:29:01,470 --> 00:29:04,860
I don't know how to say it
because I've never said it before.

304
00:29:05,390 --> 00:29:08,587
All my life I've had
to protect myself and...

305
00:29:09,230 --> 00:29:12,700
you can't protect yourself from
anything when you love somebody.

306
00:29:14,550 --> 00:29:16,427
I love you Charley.

307
00:29:19,510 --> 00:29:21,546
What's that they're playing?

308
00:29:22,590 --> 00:29:25,502
That's "Noche de Ronda."

309
00:29:26,110 --> 00:29:28,260
I'm never gonna
forget it.

310
00:29:29,270 --> 00:29:32,068
I'm never gonna forget
this dress.

311
00:29:32,670 --> 00:29:36,822
I'm never gonna forget anything
about today.

312
00:29:37,590 --> 00:29:40,787
Wherever we go
whatever it is...

313
00:29:40,910 --> 00:29:42,980
whenever they play this song...

314
00:29:44,870 --> 00:29:47,623
this is gonna be our song.

315
00:30:23,310 --> 00:30:25,266
Irene!

316
00:30:26,790 --> 00:30:29,099
Everything being equal...

317
00:30:30,270 --> 00:30:32,704
would you marry me?

318
00:30:32,830 --> 00:30:35,390
Everything being equal...

319
00:30:38,310 --> 00:30:40,426
I'd marry you tonight

320
00:30:42,190 --> 00:30:43,384
Oh, yeah!

321
00:31:14,350 --> 00:31:15,499
Have a cigar!

322
00:31:17,910 --> 00:31:19,423
My favourites.
From Mexico.

323
00:31:23,590 --> 00:31:25,546
Smell delicious!

324
00:31:25,670 --> 00:31:28,901
Charley come in.
You know Cyril, don't you?

325
00:31:29,030 --> 00:31:30,668
Hello Charley nice to see ya'.

326
00:31:31,470 --> 00:31:33,586
- Wanna cigar Charley?
- No, thanks.

327
00:31:34,110 --> 00:31:36,180
Sit down!

328
00:31:36,630 --> 00:31:39,588
Now Cyril,
you tell him...

329
00:31:40,510 --> 00:31:44,264
what happened at the big casino
with those dirty bastards.

330
00:31:44,790 --> 00:31:48,100
I've been President of the Prizzi's
casinos in Vegas for 20 years...

331
00:31:48,270 --> 00:31:51,148
and I have never seen
a scam like this before.

332
00:31:54,710 --> 00:31:57,270
I've got 14 phony I.O. U

333
00:31:57,510 --> 00:32:00,866
They come to $722,085.

334
00:32:01,150 --> 00:32:03,425
Now when the collectors go to
pick up the money...

335
00:32:03,510 --> 00:32:05,182
the player that signed the I.O. U
is dead...

336
00:32:05,710 --> 00:32:09,066
from some bad cold or something
before he signed the paper.

337
00:32:09,190 --> 00:32:11,579
Or else he was someplace else and
he wasn't in Vegas to sign it.

338
00:32:11,710 --> 00:32:14,622
Every piece of paper is counter-signed,
that's house rules...

339
00:32:14,950 --> 00:32:16,986
by Louis Paul,
the acting manager...

340
00:32:17,110 --> 00:32:19,226
and the man in the cage,
Marxie Heller.

341
00:32:19,350 --> 00:32:20,908
They had to be working together.

342
00:32:21,070 --> 00:32:22,503
I don't get it.

343
00:32:23,190 --> 00:32:26,466
Louis takes paper to the cage
all he gets back is chips.

344
00:32:26,630 --> 00:32:28,780
- That's house rules too.
- Yeah.

345
00:32:28,950 --> 00:32:31,020
Now the big boss tells me
there's a woman in it.

346
00:32:31,150 --> 00:32:33,186
He says that he twice saw Louis...

347
00:32:33,310 --> 00:32:36,188
bring two big racks of $1,000
plates to this woman.

348
00:32:36,310 --> 00:32:39,620
She went to cashiers window but
he didn't think anything of it.

349
00:32:40,710 --> 00:32:42,826
So where's Louis and Heller?

350
00:32:43,390 --> 00:32:45,346
Louis caught it.
A bullet in the head.

351
00:32:45,470 --> 00:32:47,984
Heller is hauled up in L. A
He's got a wife out there.

352
00:32:48,110 --> 00:32:50,340
They found Louis laid out
in the front seat of his car...

353
00:32:50,470 --> 00:32:52,700
in the parking lot of Leone's bar
way out on the street.

354
00:32:54,790 --> 00:32:58,578
I knew Louis when he was a helper
on an ice truck 30 years ago.

355
00:32:59,110 --> 00:33:00,748
We taught him his trade.

356
00:33:00,870 --> 00:33:03,987
He wasn't smart enough to figure
a scam like this.

357
00:33:04,390 --> 00:33:07,268
So I guess the first thing to do...

358
00:33:07,350 --> 00:33:09,420
is to find Marxie Heller.

359
00:33:09,710 --> 00:33:11,268
I remember him now.

360
00:33:11,470 --> 00:33:13,859
He always wore
a silver toupe on the job.

361
00:33:13,990 --> 00:33:18,108
He had dark brown bags under his eyes
as if he had coffee grounds in 'em.

362
00:33:18,270 --> 00:33:19,259
That's him.

363
00:33:19,590 --> 00:33:23,265
He was good with figures, steady.
But he got T.B.

364
00:33:23,390 --> 00:33:24,345
Charley...

365
00:33:24,750 --> 00:33:27,662
Louis Palo was thief
but he was ours.

366
00:33:28,470 --> 00:33:32,099
Heller must have iced him
So you ice Heller.

367
00:33:39,430 --> 00:33:40,749
Ok.

368
00:34:47,270 --> 00:34:49,625
What do you want my friend?

369
00:34:49,950 --> 00:34:51,781
The Prizzis sent me.

370
00:34:53,950 --> 00:34:55,941
Where is your wife Mr. Heller?

371
00:34:57,510 --> 00:34:59,546
She's at the supermarket.

372
00:35:00,750 --> 00:35:03,025
And just who are you?

373
00:35:03,470 --> 00:35:05,267
Charley Partanna.

374
00:35:07,630 --> 00:35:09,541
Where's the money Marxie?

375
00:35:10,270 --> 00:35:12,261
Straight arrow Charley.

376
00:35:13,070 --> 00:35:15,345
The old American hood.

377
00:35:16,310 --> 00:35:18,619
I don't know what
you're talking about.

378
00:35:19,750 --> 00:35:22,264
Get up onto your feet!
Come on!

379
00:35:22,910 --> 00:35:24,787
Put your hands up!

380
00:35:39,110 --> 00:35:40,941
I think you broke my wrist.

381
00:35:41,070 --> 00:35:42,583
You won't need it.

382
00:35:42,710 --> 00:35:43,699
Come on!

383
00:36:51,310 --> 00:36:53,221
I'm home, dear!

384
00:36:54,630 --> 00:36:57,588
Marxie's not here, Mrs. Heller.

385
00:37:11,590 --> 00:37:13,262
Charley!

386
00:37:15,830 --> 00:37:18,503
What are you doing here?

387
00:37:19,870 --> 00:37:24,261
Why didn't you call first?
You always call first!

388
00:37:24,390 --> 00:37:25,618
Charley!

389
00:37:30,670 --> 00:37:32,581
Marxie Heller's wife?

390
00:37:36,270 --> 00:37:38,625
You married to Marxie Heller?

391
00:37:43,790 --> 00:37:46,224
- Where's the money?
- Money?

392
00:37:46,350 --> 00:37:47,703
No bullshit.

393
00:37:48,230 --> 00:37:51,188
Your husband killed Louis Palo
for the money, where is it?

394
00:37:51,310 --> 00:37:55,098
I don't know what you're talking about.
You've knocked me for whoop here.

395
00:37:55,230 --> 00:37:56,709
- Where Is Marxie?
- Dead.

396
00:37:56,830 --> 00:37:58,263
In the trunk of his car.

397
00:37:58,870 --> 00:38:00,189
Stop this cheap bullshit!

398
00:38:00,270 --> 00:38:02,784
Where's the money
that your husband and Louis Palo...

399
00:38:02,910 --> 00:38:04,901
scammed from the Prizzi's
in Las Vegas?

400
00:38:08,710 --> 00:38:09,859
Maybe I...

401
00:38:10,230 --> 00:38:12,266
I do know something about it.

402
00:38:13,190 --> 00:38:16,580
He had a bag with him.
I'll show you.

403
00:38:22,230 --> 00:38:23,345
It could be in here.

404
00:38:23,470 --> 00:38:25,267
It's the only place I know
it could be.

405
00:38:42,630 --> 00:38:43,779
You sure?

406
00:38:44,790 --> 00:38:45,939
I'm sure.

407
00:38:46,350 --> 00:38:49,865
I got $360 here.
Half.

408
00:38:50,390 --> 00:38:51,345
Half?

409
00:38:51,990 --> 00:38:53,981
Don't keep telling me
what I just said.

410
00:38:54,190 --> 00:38:56,021
Where is the rest of the money?

411
00:38:56,790 --> 00:38:58,906
I didn't even know
the money was there.

412
00:38:59,070 --> 00:39:00,742
How could I know
it was short?

413
00:39:01,390 --> 00:39:03,460
When Marxie came home
three nights ago...

414
00:39:03,590 --> 00:39:06,104
after being away from
me for five years...

415
00:39:06,230 --> 00:39:07,788
he threw that bag in the closet.

416
00:39:07,910 --> 00:39:08,865
That's all I know.

417
00:39:08,990 --> 00:39:11,948
Did you ask him why he came back
to you after five years?

418
00:39:13,390 --> 00:39:15,745
Charley please try and understand.

419
00:39:16,710 --> 00:39:19,702
I was glad when Marxie
showed up because...

420
00:39:20,550 --> 00:39:23,747
it gave me a chance to
ask him for the divorce.

421
00:39:24,270 --> 00:39:25,862
You wanna know what I remember?

422
00:39:25,990 --> 00:39:28,140
I remember you coming in that door
and saying...

423
00:39:28,230 --> 00:39:29,185
"I'm home dear".

424
00:39:29,270 --> 00:39:31,659
Is that the way you ask for a divorce
these days...

425
00:39:32,710 --> 00:39:33,859
Mrs. Heller?

426
00:39:34,470 --> 00:39:36,461
Charley, I could see
how sick he was.

427
00:39:37,470 --> 00:39:41,543
I didn't need to ask him.
He only had a few weeks left.

428
00:39:45,310 --> 00:39:46,982
Oh, Marxie.

429
00:39:50,590 --> 00:39:52,626
In all the years I knew
Marxie Heller...

430
00:39:53,390 --> 00:39:56,382
he never yelled at me
or hit me...

431
00:39:56,510 --> 00:39:58,307
or stole my money.

432
00:39:59,870 --> 00:40:01,542
He was my friend.

433
00:40:02,990 --> 00:40:04,105
If it wasn't for him.

434
00:40:04,190 --> 00:40:07,865
I'd probably still be earning
my living on my back...

435
00:40:07,990 --> 00:40:10,709
with half of your pals
in Chicago.

436
00:40:11,590 --> 00:40:14,548
It was his idea to study
book keeping and...

437
00:40:15,710 --> 00:40:18,463
he got me a job
on the main wire too.

438
00:40:18,590 --> 00:40:20,820
Then he talked them into
making me a courier.

439
00:40:20,950 --> 00:40:22,429
He told me to study tax laws...

440
00:40:22,510 --> 00:40:25,104
while I was flying back and forth
to Switzerland.

441
00:40:26,910 --> 00:40:30,619
He was always there for me,
like nobody else in my life.

442
00:40:31,310 --> 00:40:32,379
And I loved him.

443
00:40:32,510 --> 00:40:34,899
Not like I love you,
But I loved him.

444
00:40:37,310 --> 00:40:40,620
And that's the Gods honest truth.
And If you don't believe me,

445
00:40:40,710 --> 00:40:43,065
why don't you just kill me
and get over with?

446
00:40:51,510 --> 00:40:53,182
I can't.

447
00:40:57,390 --> 00:41:00,382
I can't change the way
I feel about you.

448
00:41:00,990 --> 00:41:02,309
I look at you...

449
00:41:03,750 --> 00:41:06,469
and I see what I wanna see.

450
00:41:06,630 --> 00:41:08,621
That's what love is.

451
00:41:10,230 --> 00:41:12,983
If you were anybody else
I'd blow you away.

452
00:41:15,070 --> 00:41:16,628
But I can't.

453
00:41:20,870 --> 00:41:22,542
I have to believe this.

454
00:41:28,910 --> 00:41:30,946
Well how'd it go out there?

455
00:41:31,190 --> 00:41:32,543
Okay.

456
00:41:32,670 --> 00:41:35,389
I brought back 360 dollars.

457
00:41:35,870 --> 00:41:38,338
How come only half?

458
00:41:38,590 --> 00:41:43,106
I talked to Heller
he won't say nothing.

459
00:41:43,230 --> 00:41:46,825
So I pay him off with a bing.
Then the wife comes home.

460
00:41:48,190 --> 00:41:49,464
We talk.

461
00:41:49,750 --> 00:41:50,819
No problem.

462
00:41:51,750 --> 00:41:54,423
She's brings me the money
which she thinks is there...

463
00:41:54,550 --> 00:41:57,348
cause he brought a satchel home
with him when he came.

464
00:41:57,470 --> 00:41:58,585
I count.

465
00:41:58,710 --> 00:42:00,268
It's only half.

466
00:42:01,070 --> 00:42:02,628
You worked her over?

467
00:42:03,390 --> 00:42:04,982
No, she was scared.

468
00:42:05,110 --> 00:42:06,862
She knew I'd tapped her husband.

469
00:42:06,990 --> 00:42:08,139
I think she was telling the truth.

470
00:42:09,190 --> 00:42:10,908
What happened to Louis split?

471
00:42:12,790 --> 00:42:14,462
I don't know Dominic.

472
00:42:15,190 --> 00:42:18,341
Somebody has got
our 360 dollars.

473
00:42:20,590 --> 00:42:22,103
Find it.

474
00:42:26,310 --> 00:42:28,062
Okay.

475
00:42:36,710 --> 00:42:40,339
When I close my eyes
and you're cooking, Charley...

476
00:42:40,470 --> 00:42:42,222
I think your mamma
is still with us.

477
00:42:43,070 --> 00:42:44,583
Thanks Poppa.

478
00:42:46,150 --> 00:42:47,299
Pop...

479
00:42:49,230 --> 00:42:53,189
do you think Dominic believes
that I copped that other 360?

480
00:42:53,270 --> 00:42:55,989
What the hell Charley.
The money had to go someplace.

481
00:42:56,110 --> 00:42:58,101
Dominic hates your guts anyway.

482
00:42:58,230 --> 00:43:02,269
Yeah that's getting real bad.
He never lets up.

483
00:43:02,390 --> 00:43:04,984
He don't eat right.
He never eats like this.

484
00:43:05,110 --> 00:43:08,739
He's got heartburn from
that place he eats at all the time.

485
00:43:09,230 --> 00:43:12,620
They make garbage.
It's not like this.

486
00:43:13,390 --> 00:43:17,588
Well the man can't hate me
cause he don't eat right Pop.

487
00:43:18,550 --> 00:43:19,824
Charley...

488
00:43:21,070 --> 00:43:24,858
believe me, I know how
that mind of Dominics' works.

489
00:43:24,990 --> 00:43:26,742
His life turned out miserable.

490
00:43:27,150 --> 00:43:29,186
He has to blame someone.

491
00:43:29,310 --> 00:43:30,584
Every time he sees you...

492
00:43:30,710 --> 00:43:32,905
he's reminded of the shame Maerose
put on you...

493
00:43:33,070 --> 00:43:34,503
on him,
and on the whole family.

494
00:43:34,710 --> 00:43:35,745
You forgot.

495
00:43:35,870 --> 00:43:37,588
Not Dominic.

496
00:43:38,230 --> 00:43:42,223
He probably worked it all around
so the whole mess is all your fault.

497
00:43:42,710 --> 00:43:44,860
Get it out of your head,
out of your head.

498
00:43:45,990 --> 00:43:48,379
Great dinner Charley!

499
00:43:48,830 --> 00:43:50,422
Now.

500
00:43:50,590 --> 00:43:52,421
What's the occasion?

501
00:43:53,310 --> 00:43:55,824
I wanna show you a woman.

502
00:43:56,310 --> 00:43:59,541
The one that I went to California
to see about.

503
00:44:01,790 --> 00:44:03,860
Isn't she beautiful?

504
00:44:05,390 --> 00:44:06,982
I like her.

505
00:44:07,110 --> 00:44:09,624
Kind of darker and
more round woman myself.

506
00:44:09,950 --> 00:44:11,861
See you got a picture of me
with her.

507
00:44:29,550 --> 00:44:32,223
- Pop what are you doing?
- Jesus Charley!

508
00:44:32,350 --> 00:44:35,979
She was the one we brought in
to make the Turbino hit.

509
00:44:36,350 --> 00:44:38,261
She was a speciality hitter.

510
00:44:51,110 --> 00:44:53,624
Charley let me give you a hand
with the dishes.

511
00:44:53,750 --> 00:44:57,868
No, it's ok.
I'll just stack.

512
00:44:58,710 --> 00:45:00,985
The girl'll take care of that
in the morning.

513
00:45:01,110 --> 00:45:02,065
Thanks.

514
00:45:02,190 --> 00:45:03,145
Alright.

515
00:45:04,710 --> 00:45:07,508
Then, I'll just head on home.

516
00:45:08,630 --> 00:45:10,382
Getting late by my clock.

517
00:45:12,070 --> 00:45:13,867
- Great dinner Charley.
- Thanks.

518
00:45:13,990 --> 00:45:16,379
- Goodnight Pop.
- Night son.

519
00:45:17,150 --> 00:45:18,299
Thanks a lot.

520
00:46:01,910 --> 00:46:04,060
Maerose?
Charley.

521
00:46:04,190 --> 00:46:07,182
What is this?
It's 00:45 a.m.

522
00:46:07,310 --> 00:46:09,619
It's the second time
you've called me in four years.

523
00:46:09,950 --> 00:46:11,383
Mae.

524
00:46:12,990 --> 00:46:14,582
Mae, listen.

525
00:46:15,350 --> 00:46:16,942
I broke that vase.

526
00:46:17,070 --> 00:46:19,186
What vase?

527
00:46:19,310 --> 00:46:23,622
That special vase
that matches the rug.

528
00:46:24,070 --> 00:46:26,948
The one you knocked your self out
trying to find.

529
00:46:27,630 --> 00:46:30,098
Charley what are you out
of your mind.

530
00:46:30,950 --> 00:46:33,589
- You alone?
- Course I'm alone.

531
00:46:36,190 --> 00:46:38,260
I gotta see ya'.

532
00:46:49,990 --> 00:46:51,582
What's with you?

533
00:46:52,510 --> 00:46:54,228
We gotta talk.

534
00:46:54,990 --> 00:46:59,188
You wanna talk out here
or you wanna sit down and talk?

535
00:47:00,430 --> 00:47:01,749
Sure.

536
00:47:08,510 --> 00:47:11,263
Oh, this is a beautiful set up
you got here Mae.

537
00:47:11,390 --> 00:47:14,188
The colours are right.
That's what counts.

538
00:47:14,750 --> 00:47:18,823
Everybody sees shapes differently
but colours are forever.

539
00:47:18,950 --> 00:47:19,905
Yeah.

540
00:47:22,310 --> 00:47:24,062
Why'd you call, Charley?

541
00:47:27,150 --> 00:47:29,266
We wasted a lot of time Mae.

542
00:47:29,390 --> 00:47:31,745
Four years you call that
a lot of time?

543
00:47:31,870 --> 00:47:34,225
How come you didn't wait
till I was 50?

544
00:47:34,350 --> 00:47:38,866
You could have been a fat wop
broad by the time you were 50.

545
00:47:48,110 --> 00:47:51,864
You wanna do it Charley?
Is that what you want?

546
00:47:53,430 --> 00:47:56,627
Whoah take it easy!
What the hell Mae!

547
00:47:58,270 --> 00:48:00,784
Nobody took it slower than me
Charley.

548
00:48:01,310 --> 00:48:02,868
Four years.

549
00:48:03,070 --> 00:48:05,584
Answer the question
do you wanna do it?

550
00:48:07,070 --> 00:48:08,822
Well, yeah.

551
00:48:09,190 --> 00:48:10,464
So...

552
00:48:11,550 --> 00:48:13,222
let's do it.

553
00:48:17,230 --> 00:48:18,868
With all the lights on?

554
00:48:18,990 --> 00:48:23,063
Yeah right here on the oriental.

555
00:48:23,190 --> 00:48:25,863
With all the lights on.

556
00:48:27,630 --> 00:48:29,905
Mamma Mia!

557
00:48:37,630 --> 00:48:39,063
Thanks.

558
00:48:46,870 --> 00:48:48,701
What's your problem Charley?

559
00:48:50,110 --> 00:48:52,624
It certainly isn't
your God damned face.

560
00:48:54,630 --> 00:48:57,190
How can I tell you
with all people?

561
00:48:58,150 --> 00:49:00,869
But I got nobody else I can talk to.

562
00:49:03,350 --> 00:49:05,625
It's about a woman.

563
00:49:08,830 --> 00:49:10,104
Go ahead.

564
00:49:10,910 --> 00:49:12,229
Tell me anyway.

565
00:49:13,430 --> 00:49:16,820
How can I feel worse than
I used to feel before last night.

566
00:49:18,910 --> 00:49:22,539
We grew up together.
We're the same people.

567
00:49:24,310 --> 00:49:27,825
What the hell Charley,
the calendar takes care of everything.

568
00:49:32,550 --> 00:49:35,064
I met her in a church.

569
00:49:35,830 --> 00:49:37,263
Just happened.

570
00:49:37,910 --> 00:49:40,265
I knew she was the woman for me.

571
00:49:43,790 --> 00:49:46,224
She'd organised a scam in Vegas.

572
00:49:47,190 --> 00:49:50,899
I go looking for the bad guy and
it turns out to be my woman.

573
00:49:51,070 --> 00:49:52,139
Can you imagine this?

574
00:49:52,550 --> 00:49:54,188
Not only that.

575
00:49:54,310 --> 00:49:56,744
Pop tells me...

576
00:49:56,870 --> 00:50:00,021
she's the piece man
for the Turbino contract.

577
00:50:01,110 --> 00:50:02,304
But just the same.

578
00:50:02,430 --> 00:50:04,068
I love her Mae.

579
00:50:04,910 --> 00:50:05,865
I love her.

580
00:50:07,230 --> 00:50:08,504
Well.

581
00:50:09,550 --> 00:50:13,099
Can I live with this?
I gotta do something about.

582
00:50:13,390 --> 00:50:14,743
I gotta straighten it out.

583
00:50:15,150 --> 00:50:16,265
Then do.

584
00:50:17,710 --> 00:50:18,665
Do what?

585
00:50:18,750 --> 00:50:20,342
Do I ice her?
Do I marry her?

586
00:50:20,630 --> 00:50:22,109
Which one of these?

587
00:50:22,510 --> 00:50:23,863
Marry her Charley.

588
00:50:25,510 --> 00:50:27,626
Just because she's a thief
and a hitter...

589
00:50:27,750 --> 00:50:30,548
doesn't mean she isn't a good
woman in all the other departments.

590
00:50:30,910 --> 00:50:34,823
If she was some kind of fashion model
it wouldn't last more than 30 days.

591
00:50:35,350 --> 00:50:38,069
But you and she is in the same
line of business.

592
00:50:39,550 --> 00:50:43,065
You're lucky you've found each other.
You know that Charley?

593
00:50:43,190 --> 00:50:44,543
Yeah.

594
00:50:44,670 --> 00:50:46,342
She's an American.

595
00:50:46,510 --> 00:50:49,422
She had a chance to make a buck
so she grabbed it.

596
00:50:50,510 --> 00:50:51,829
Marry her Charley...

597
00:50:52,710 --> 00:50:55,941
and at least I'll be able
to get something out of it.

598
00:50:56,750 --> 00:50:59,264
I'll be able to go back
in the family.

599
00:51:02,150 --> 00:51:03,105
Yeah.

600
00:51:11,270 --> 00:51:12,225
Thanks.

601
00:51:12,310 --> 00:51:14,301
Shall we have them play
"Noche de Ronda"?

602
00:51:15,390 --> 00:51:16,345
Yeah.

603
00:51:16,430 --> 00:51:17,545
Would you ask them?

604
00:51:24,430 --> 00:51:26,500
I've been all shook up.

605
00:51:26,630 --> 00:51:27,585
Why?

606
00:51:29,190 --> 00:51:30,589
I know everything.

607
00:51:31,670 --> 00:51:33,228
I know you made
the hit on Turbino...

608
00:51:33,350 --> 00:51:36,262
after the wedding reception
when we met.

609
00:51:36,550 --> 00:51:39,940
I know you've been scamming us
with Louis and your husband.

610
00:51:45,310 --> 00:51:47,665
I did the work on Turbino.

611
00:51:47,790 --> 00:51:51,226
I had nothing to do with
what Marxie and his partner did.

612
00:51:52,350 --> 00:51:54,580
Louis Paulo was so suspicious...

613
00:51:54,710 --> 00:51:57,986
that he checked the car for bombs
every time he started it.

614
00:51:58,070 --> 00:52:00,026
But he would have let some
beautiful broad

615
00:52:00,110 --> 00:52:02,226
walk over get in
and sit on his face.

616
00:52:05,150 --> 00:52:07,789
No matter how you got it
in your head Charley, you're wrong.

617
00:52:08,630 --> 00:52:11,190
I had nothing to do with it.
Nothing.

618
00:52:14,510 --> 00:52:15,909
Charley.

619
00:52:17,270 --> 00:52:21,149
Did you mean it that first night
when you asked me if I'd marry you?

620
00:52:23,150 --> 00:52:24,503
Charley?

621
00:52:28,470 --> 00:52:30,062
Alright.

622
00:52:31,430 --> 00:52:35,264
The Prizzi's are gonna have
to believe me cause I believe you.

623
00:52:37,110 --> 00:52:40,625
So could we get married.

624
00:52:40,910 --> 00:52:43,583
What you say we have one of those
pineapple drinks?

625
00:52:43,710 --> 00:52:45,746
The honeymoon has already started.

626
00:52:45,870 --> 00:52:47,861
Kiss me Charley.

627
00:52:48,270 --> 00:52:50,226
In public?

628
00:52:54,030 --> 00:52:56,146
Pop?
Charley.

629
00:52:56,270 --> 00:52:57,783
I'm in L.A.

630
00:52:57,990 --> 00:53:00,868
And that ain't all.
I'm gonna get married.

631
00:53:02,030 --> 00:53:04,021
The same woman?
The contractor?

632
00:53:04,430 --> 00:53:06,421
Yeah, she's Polish...

633
00:53:06,550 --> 00:53:08,620
but the family will get used
to that gradually.

634
00:53:09,030 --> 00:53:10,668
Yeah, when she walks in a room...

635
00:53:10,790 --> 00:53:13,145
the rest of the women of family
are gonna have to shut up.

636
00:53:13,270 --> 00:53:15,226
But I know how you feel
about her Charley.

637
00:53:15,310 --> 00:53:17,540
I'd not try to stop nature.
Good luck, son.

638
00:53:17,670 --> 00:53:20,264
- Thanks Pop.
- Say. Listen.

639
00:53:21,030 --> 00:53:24,067
The Don wants you here for
a big meeting tomorrow night.

640
00:53:24,350 --> 00:53:27,740
Jesus, Pop what about
my honeymoon?

641
00:53:28,910 --> 00:53:30,741
So you'll have it in Brooklyn.

642
00:53:31,390 --> 00:53:32,823
Shit!

643
00:54:17,470 --> 00:54:21,702
So what do you say
we go for some confetti...

644
00:54:21,830 --> 00:54:24,628
and maybe a couple of pictures?

645
00:54:24,750 --> 00:54:26,581
Whatever you say honey.

646
00:54:27,590 --> 00:54:31,265
If only Marxie could see me now.

647
00:54:32,630 --> 00:54:33,665
What's so funny?

648
00:54:33,910 --> 00:54:36,663
Me marrying a Sicilian.

649
00:54:37,990 --> 00:54:40,458
I can hear him.
He always used to say:

650
00:54:41,190 --> 00:54:43,624
"The Jews are bad enough
in this business...

651
00:54:43,750 --> 00:54:46,867
but the Sicilians'd rather eat
their children than part with money.

652
00:54:46,990 --> 00:54:49,265
And they're very fond
of their children".

653
00:54:52,390 --> 00:54:54,779
Marxie Heller is so fucking smart...

654
00:54:54,910 --> 00:54:56,866
how come he's so fucking dead?

655
00:54:57,070 --> 00:54:58,628
Next.

656
00:55:41,190 --> 00:55:44,307
The man at the end of the table...

657
00:55:44,430 --> 00:55:46,785
is Mr. Alvin Gomski.

658
00:55:46,910 --> 00:55:51,301
He's Treasurer of 18 Lodges Bank
in the United States...

659
00:55:51,430 --> 00:55:54,820
of which we own 25º/º.

660
00:55:55,310 --> 00:55:59,223
Now I asked Mr. Gomski
to come here today...

661
00:55:59,350 --> 00:56:02,786
so you can hear from his own mouth
what has been happening.

662
00:56:03,350 --> 00:56:05,625
The bank president
Mr. Robert Finlay...

663
00:56:05,750 --> 00:56:08,025
is stealing from the bank...

664
00:56:08,390 --> 00:56:10,506
mainly through crooked
foreign exchange deals.

665
00:56:10,830 --> 00:56:12,741
If he's allowed to continue...

666
00:56:12,870 --> 00:56:14,826
the bank will go under
in less than a year.

667
00:56:15,110 --> 00:56:17,101
Thank you Mr. Gomski.

668
00:56:17,230 --> 00:56:22,304
Harry go.
See Mr. Gomski to his car.

669
00:56:27,310 --> 00:56:31,144
Robert Finlay's real name
is...

670
00:56:31,310 --> 00:56:34,029
Rosario Filargi.

671
00:56:34,550 --> 00:56:38,702
Now anybody who changes his
name from Filargi to Finlay...

672
00:56:38,830 --> 00:56:40,786
is also stupid enough...

673
00:56:40,910 --> 00:56:45,426
to think that we wouldn't
protect our 25 percent.

674
00:56:45,550 --> 00:56:47,825
Tell them our plan Eduardo.

675
00:56:50,870 --> 00:56:53,907
We are gonna kidnap Filargi.

676
00:56:55,110 --> 00:56:58,341
He's covered with two and a half
million in kidnap insurance.

677
00:56:58,470 --> 00:57:00,267
That's the tag on him
and we make the snatch.

678
00:57:01,070 --> 00:57:03,265
We know the insurance company
is gonna pay cause...

679
00:57:03,390 --> 00:57:05,221
as Charley has already pointed out...

680
00:57:05,350 --> 00:57:07,386
that money is tax deductible

681
00:57:07,910 --> 00:57:10,265
We're also gonna leave a trail...

682
00:57:10,390 --> 00:57:13,985
so that the Feds think Filargi
organised the whole thing.

683
00:57:14,110 --> 00:57:17,147
Cheating the bank,
milking the insurance company.

684
00:57:19,390 --> 00:57:21,381
When the mierda hits the fan...

685
00:57:22,150 --> 00:57:24,710
we'll be able to buy another
good size chunk of the bank...

686
00:57:24,870 --> 00:57:26,667
for about 10 cents on the dollar.

687
00:57:26,790 --> 00:57:28,542
We get control and interest.

688
00:57:29,070 --> 00:57:30,423
Eventually...

689
00:57:31,670 --> 00:57:35,822
we stand to make
sixty seventy million dollars.

690
00:57:36,590 --> 00:57:39,343
Thank you, Eduardo, my son.

691
00:57:40,110 --> 00:57:44,547
Some men suffer most
when you take their lives.

692
00:57:44,710 --> 00:57:47,588
Life is what is sweetest to them.

693
00:57:47,710 --> 00:57:51,623
For Filargi money is sweetest.

694
00:57:52,390 --> 00:57:57,669
We'll leave him with his life and
without money or anywhere to get it.

695
00:57:58,470 --> 00:58:01,303
Well done Don Corrado.
That's beautiful.

696
00:58:02,150 --> 00:58:03,947
I almost feel sorry for the guy.

697
00:58:04,150 --> 00:58:06,106
Beautiful is right.

698
00:58:06,430 --> 00:58:09,706
I like most beautiful things, Charley.

699
00:58:09,830 --> 00:58:12,219
This one is very simple.

700
00:58:12,310 --> 00:58:14,028
We rely on you.

701
00:58:18,030 --> 00:58:19,543
How do you want me to handle it?

702
00:58:19,670 --> 00:58:22,343
Pick your own people.
We don't wanna know.

703
00:58:31,150 --> 00:58:34,825
Dominic my son stay with me
a moment.

704
00:58:40,510 --> 00:58:44,185
Maerose has written to me, Dominic.

705
00:58:44,590 --> 00:58:48,822
The man she wronged
has married another woman.

706
00:58:49,510 --> 00:58:51,819
Now Maerose has suffered,
Dominic...

707
00:58:52,070 --> 00:58:55,904
as you have suffered during
the years of her disgrace.

708
00:58:57,750 --> 00:59:02,540
Now honour is protected,
I beg you...

709
00:59:02,750 --> 00:59:04,263
on my knees...

710
00:59:04,510 --> 00:59:07,070
show compassion.

711
00:59:07,470 --> 00:59:11,349
Here.
Here read her letter.

712
00:59:13,910 --> 00:59:17,869
Look how the child loves you.

713
00:59:17,990 --> 00:59:20,868
She wants to take care of you.

714
00:59:24,510 --> 00:59:26,341
Send her to me Poppa.

715
00:59:29,030 --> 00:59:30,907
She's my daughter again.

716
00:59:31,070 --> 00:59:33,584
What we gotta do is take care
of the bodyguard...

717
00:59:33,710 --> 00:59:36,702
and get Filargi down to
our van in the basement.

718
00:59:36,830 --> 00:59:38,548
- Ok?
- Ok.

719
00:59:38,670 --> 00:59:40,706
There's only three apartments
on the floor.

720
00:59:44,430 --> 00:59:45,909
How are you gonna do that?

721
00:59:46,550 --> 00:59:48,461
One of them is empty,
this one we rent it.

722
00:59:48,670 --> 00:59:51,548
The other one,
we send matinee theater tickets...

723
00:59:51,670 --> 00:59:54,821
and heavy duty lunch invitation
to the dame that lives there.

724
00:59:54,950 --> 00:59:57,305
A limo picks her up
and brings her back.

725
00:59:57,390 --> 00:59:59,745
She thinks it's a prize
she's getting...

726
00:59:59,870 --> 01:00:03,260
for working at the public library
for sixty years.

727
01:00:03,390 --> 01:00:05,267
She'll go alright.

728
01:00:06,190 --> 01:00:09,546
Everyday Filargi's bodyguard
comes out first.

729
01:00:09,670 --> 01:00:11,388
He goes to the elevator,
pushes the button.

730
01:00:11,670 --> 01:00:13,626
When he gets there,
he puts it on hold.

731
01:00:13,750 --> 01:00:17,106
Then he goes back to the apartment
and knocks on the door.

732
01:00:17,230 --> 01:00:19,221
That's when Filargi comes out.

733
01:00:19,910 --> 01:00:22,708
You know guys, you need a woman
on this stand.

734
01:00:23,950 --> 01:00:26,418
- A woman?
- Yeah.

735
01:00:26,550 --> 01:00:29,542
A woman comes out of
the south apartment holding a baby.

736
01:00:29,670 --> 01:00:32,821
After Filargi's bodyguard gets him
out of his apartment.

737
01:00:32,950 --> 01:00:35,180
She smiles at them,
she goes gogo gaga at the baby.

738
01:00:35,270 --> 01:00:37,420
She tosses the little darling
at the bodyguard...

739
01:00:37,510 --> 01:00:38,863
who naturally tries to catch it.

740
01:00:38,950 --> 01:00:41,783
While he's doing that, she gets her
piece out and covers him.

741
01:00:41,910 --> 01:00:45,061
You come out of the other apartment
and take Filargi down to the garage.

742
01:00:45,150 --> 01:00:48,859
She takes the bodyguard back into
Filargi's apartment and does the job.

743
01:00:49,270 --> 01:00:51,306
That's good.

744
01:00:51,430 --> 01:00:53,261
For Christ sake.

745
01:00:53,590 --> 01:00:55,501
Where we gonna get a baby?

746
01:00:55,630 --> 01:00:58,588
Where we gonna find a broad
who would do something like this?

747
01:00:58,710 --> 01:01:00,985
Where?
Here, me.

748
01:01:01,110 --> 01:01:02,384
We get a fake baby.

749
01:01:02,550 --> 01:01:04,745
Good thinking Irene.

750
01:01:04,910 --> 01:01:06,059
You guys work it out.

751
01:01:06,190 --> 01:01:09,262
I got a terrific dinner almost ready.
Just a couple of minutes.

752
01:01:10,750 --> 01:01:13,469
Pop, what's the matter with you?

753
01:01:13,790 --> 01:01:16,987
I didn't get married so
my wife could go on working.

754
01:01:17,070 --> 01:01:19,425
Charley, she's right
and you know it.

755
01:01:19,550 --> 01:01:22,462
Throwing the baby.
Well that's strictly a masterpiece.

756
01:01:22,910 --> 01:01:26,380
The Prizzi's ever found out
I used my own wife on this job...

757
01:01:26,510 --> 01:01:28,387
I couldn't hold my head up.

758
01:01:28,550 --> 01:01:31,269
I'd be the laughing stock
of every family...

759
01:01:31,390 --> 01:01:32,869
in Brooklyn and New York.

760
01:01:33,190 --> 01:01:35,306
Who's gonna know Charley?

761
01:01:35,430 --> 01:01:38,627
And what's that compared to sixty,
seventy million dollars.

762
01:01:43,950 --> 01:01:46,589
Gentlemen, dinner is served.

763
01:02:05,830 --> 01:02:08,264
- Maerose!
- Coming Poppa!

764
01:02:54,630 --> 01:02:58,305
Jees Mae, you look awful!

765
01:02:59,430 --> 01:03:02,228
My beautiful daughter
has turned into an old woman.

766
01:03:04,430 --> 01:03:07,183
Charley Partanna did this to you.

767
01:03:07,950 --> 01:03:11,101
He had a chance to become part
of the Prizzi family.

768
01:03:11,230 --> 01:03:13,698
He had no use for you.

769
01:03:13,830 --> 01:03:17,584
Oh, he had a use for me Poppa.

770
01:03:19,430 --> 01:03:22,024
He came to my place in New York
the night before...

771
01:03:22,110 --> 01:03:24,544
he married that woman
in California.

772
01:03:25,430 --> 01:03:28,263
And he forced himself on me.

773
01:03:29,030 --> 01:03:31,305
And he did it to me.

774
01:03:32,750 --> 01:03:35,548
- He did it to you?
- Yeah, Poppa.

775
01:03:35,670 --> 01:03:39,345
Screwed me three times, maybe four.
I can't remember.

776
01:03:39,470 --> 01:03:41,859
You whore.
Shut your filthy mouth you here.

777
01:03:42,150 --> 01:03:44,618
How can you say such things
to your own father.

778
01:03:46,310 --> 01:03:49,586
He done that to you, Charley?

779
01:03:49,710 --> 01:03:51,780
- You sure?
- Am I sure, Poppa.

780
01:03:51,910 --> 01:03:54,060
You should see the size of him.

781
01:03:54,150 --> 01:03:55,629
- You should.
- Shut up.

782
01:03:55,750 --> 01:03:57,945
How can you say such things
to your father?

783
01:03:58,630 --> 01:03:59,949
Where's your honour?

784
01:04:00,110 --> 01:04:04,149
Are you kidding Poppa?
I have no honour anymore.

785
01:04:38,750 --> 01:04:40,866
Here Poppa.

786
01:05:15,430 --> 01:05:17,421
- Good afternoon.
- Good afternoon.

787
01:05:20,830 --> 01:05:22,058
Do you mind?

788
01:05:32,830 --> 01:05:33,785
Catch!

789
01:05:42,430 --> 01:05:43,909
I must have the wrong floor.

790
01:05:44,990 --> 01:05:46,423
Oh my God!

791
01:05:57,950 --> 01:05:59,099
No blood I think.

792
01:05:59,230 --> 01:06:01,380
Ok, come on!
Lets move them!

793
01:06:11,070 --> 01:06:13,345
I had to hit her Charley,
she was looking straight at me.

794
01:06:13,470 --> 01:06:15,426
You done right, really.

795
01:06:31,070 --> 01:06:32,139
I can't get over it.

796
01:06:34,870 --> 01:06:37,623
I mean what kind of creep
wouldn't catch a baby.

797
01:06:37,750 --> 01:06:40,628
If it was real,
it could have been crippled for life.

798
01:06:41,430 --> 01:06:44,422
He wasn't
the bodyguard of the baby.

799
01:06:47,590 --> 01:06:50,627
When the Don gets what he wants
and when I ask him for some time...

800
01:06:50,750 --> 01:06:53,344
we're gonna go to the old country
have a real honeymoon.

801
01:06:53,870 --> 01:06:56,179
Maybe even a real baby.

802
01:06:56,310 --> 01:06:58,426
Oh, God Charley,
I love you.

803
01:07:18,150 --> 01:07:19,629
What do you want?

804
01:07:19,870 --> 01:07:22,065
Come on!

805
01:07:32,510 --> 01:07:33,829
- See you at dinner.
- Ok, dear.

806
01:08:07,230 --> 01:08:10,779
Recapping our top stories
at this hour.

807
01:08:10,950 --> 01:08:13,942
- Come on Charley.
- Shut up, I wanna hear this.

808
01:08:14,070 --> 01:08:16,220
Police have now identified
both victims.

809
01:08:16,350 --> 01:08:18,545
One of whom was
a police captains wife.

810
01:08:18,630 --> 01:08:19,585
Shit!

811
01:08:19,750 --> 01:08:21,820
The man found with her
was the bodyguard...

812
01:08:21,990 --> 01:08:23,628
of the bank President
Robert Finlay.

813
01:08:23,750 --> 01:08:25,741
Finlay's apartment is right
next door...

814
01:08:25,830 --> 01:08:27,946
to the one where
the two bodies were found.

815
01:08:28,030 --> 01:08:29,668
Bank officers
reported him missing...

816
01:08:29,910 --> 01:08:31,866
when he didn't show up
at a meeting on Monday morning.

817
01:08:31,950 --> 01:08:34,418
Police now speculate
he has been kidnapped.

818
01:08:34,510 --> 01:08:37,900
They also believe
that Victoria Calhain...

819
01:08:38,030 --> 01:08:41,067
stumbled accidentally into
the scene of the crime...

820
01:08:41,150 --> 01:08:42,219
and the kidnappers...

821
01:08:42,350 --> 01:08:45,183
Look at this.
First she gotta push the wrong button.

822
01:08:46,030 --> 01:08:49,386
Then the broad turns out to be
a cops wife.

823
01:08:50,070 --> 01:08:51,867
Call's still waiting Charley.

824
01:09:04,110 --> 01:09:05,065
Yeah?

825
01:09:05,230 --> 01:09:06,345
Hi, darling!

826
01:09:07,550 --> 01:09:09,506
Were you watching the TV just now?

827
01:09:09,830 --> 01:09:13,539
Yeah, a police captains wife.
I couldn't believe my luck.

828
01:09:13,710 --> 01:09:16,508
All hell is gonna break out
over this, Irene.

829
01:09:16,630 --> 01:09:19,349
Cops don't like it much
when we hit one of their wives.

830
01:09:19,550 --> 01:09:21,222
But it was an accident.

831
01:09:43,910 --> 01:09:45,548
Mr. Ciglione?

832
01:09:54,110 --> 01:09:55,509
Mr. Ciglione.

833
01:10:02,590 --> 01:10:05,866
Mrs. Prizzi would you like to
come to my office please?

834
01:10:06,310 --> 01:10:08,904
Mrs. Prizzi,
would you care for a drink?

835
01:10:09,390 --> 01:10:11,858
I'll have a Babycham.

836
01:10:11,990 --> 01:10:12,945
Babycham?

837
01:10:13,070 --> 01:10:15,345
You heard what the lady said.
A Babycham!

838
01:10:15,430 --> 01:10:16,419
Okay!

839
01:10:17,590 --> 01:10:19,262
Would you please sit down
Mrs. Prizzi?

840
01:10:19,470 --> 01:10:21,426
I think I got something for you.

841
01:10:21,870 --> 01:10:22,825
Capulla!

842
01:10:25,790 --> 01:10:26,745
Come on!

843
01:10:28,270 --> 01:10:29,498
Sit down over there.

844
01:10:39,270 --> 01:10:40,464
That the broad?

845
01:10:41,510 --> 01:10:42,499
Tell the lady.

846
01:10:43,350 --> 01:10:46,979
I was using this camper as
a trick room in the parking lot.

847
01:10:47,270 --> 01:10:50,660
As I lifted up my head from the job.
I saw this woman in hot pants...

848
01:10:50,790 --> 01:10:54,749
running to the lights of the car where
Louis Paulo caught it in the head.

849
01:10:55,030 --> 01:10:57,544
She's in the car a couple minutes.

850
01:10:57,670 --> 01:11:00,059
Then she gets out
and goes to the trunk...

851
01:11:00,190 --> 01:11:02,943
takes out a satchel
and then she fades.

852
01:11:03,390 --> 01:11:04,982
The same woman?

853
01:11:06,390 --> 01:11:07,948
Yeah it's the same one.

854
01:11:25,750 --> 01:11:28,708
Why don't you go on one
of those cruises, honey?

855
01:11:36,270 --> 01:11:40,821
You've reached the answering
machine for 5554375.

856
01:11:40,950 --> 01:11:42,986
Nobody can take your call
right now.

857
01:11:43,070 --> 01:11:45,140
Please leave a message
after the beep.

858
01:11:46,390 --> 01:11:51,100
Meet me on the promenade,
Brooklyn 7pm tomorrow.

859
01:11:51,190 --> 01:11:52,589
Full price.

860
01:11:52,710 --> 01:11:56,544
I'll be on a bench at the end
reading "Popular mechanics".

861
01:12:39,710 --> 01:12:42,349
Are you the contractor?

862
01:12:45,710 --> 01:12:47,063
How much?

863
01:12:47,550 --> 01:12:49,188
It depends.

864
01:12:49,630 --> 01:12:51,939
Some hits are tricky.
Who is it?

865
01:12:52,110 --> 01:12:55,022
A Brooklyn fellow,
Charley Partanna.

866
01:12:55,190 --> 01:12:56,339
Charley Partanna?

867
01:13:10,110 --> 01:13:14,865
Amalia told me that
you wanna thank me...

868
01:13:14,990 --> 01:13:17,265
for bringing you home?

869
01:13:17,630 --> 01:13:22,101
Well,
you are blood of my blood!

870
01:13:22,630 --> 01:13:24,427
You're flesh of my flesh!

871
01:13:25,590 --> 01:13:28,900
And as long as I'm able...

872
01:13:29,030 --> 01:13:30,861
I'm gonna think about
your well being.

873
01:13:31,030 --> 01:13:33,146
Thank you, grandfather.

874
01:13:33,550 --> 01:13:36,223
You have drawn me back
from purgatory.

875
01:13:39,310 --> 01:13:41,824
I wish you had been a son.

876
01:13:41,950 --> 01:13:44,464
You are a true Prizzi.

877
01:13:45,110 --> 01:13:47,101
Hey, you like to have a cookie?

878
01:13:50,470 --> 01:13:53,382
It is I who must offer you a gift
grandfather.

879
01:13:53,510 --> 01:13:55,466
A gesture of my gratitude.

880
01:13:55,590 --> 01:13:59,424
I have always enjoyed gifts.

881
01:14:08,870 --> 01:14:13,022
Who's this handsome lady?

882
01:14:13,750 --> 01:14:17,026
That is Charley Partanna's wife,
grandfather.

883
01:14:23,750 --> 01:14:24,865
Well?

884
01:14:27,310 --> 01:14:30,666
My gift to you is not only
the pictures...

885
01:14:31,230 --> 01:14:33,107
but also what they mean.

886
01:14:34,030 --> 01:14:36,908
Louis Palo was killed
in the parking lot in Las Vegas.

887
01:14:36,990 --> 01:14:37,945
I know.

888
01:14:38,030 --> 01:14:40,544
I took these pictures there.

889
01:14:41,630 --> 01:14:45,020
There was a woman who had been
turning tricks in a camper...

890
01:14:45,150 --> 01:14:46,503
in the parking lot.

891
01:14:46,750 --> 01:14:48,900
She told me she saw this woman...

892
01:14:49,070 --> 01:14:50,583
get into a car with Palo.

893
01:14:50,910 --> 01:14:54,505
After a minute she got out,
went to the trunk...

894
01:14:54,630 --> 01:14:56,348
and took out a satchel.

895
01:14:58,110 --> 01:14:59,862
This woman?

896
01:14:59,990 --> 01:15:01,582
Yes, grandfather.

897
01:15:04,590 --> 01:15:06,342
She killed Palo...

898
01:15:06,710 --> 01:15:10,783
and she stole 720 dollars
from us.

899
01:15:11,270 --> 01:15:13,659
She gave back half to save herself.

900
01:15:16,390 --> 01:15:19,462
What do you want me to do?

901
01:15:20,470 --> 01:15:21,664
She dishonoured us!

902
01:15:22,070 --> 01:15:24,140
You're like me.

903
01:15:24,630 --> 01:15:26,860
We forgive nothing.

904
01:15:31,830 --> 01:15:36,142
What would that do
to Charley Partanna?

905
01:15:36,710 --> 01:15:39,747
She must pay
like anybody else.

906
01:15:39,910 --> 01:15:41,582
Oh. What you ask...

907
01:15:41,670 --> 01:15:45,868
that would cause Charley
great pain.

908
01:15:46,870 --> 01:15:49,145
What is that compared to
the honour of the Prizzi's?

909
01:15:49,750 --> 01:15:53,425
Charley is like my son.

910
01:15:53,550 --> 01:15:58,340
I pledged to be his second father
on the day that he was born.

911
01:15:59,110 --> 01:16:00,748
- Grandfather.
- Shut up.

912
01:16:03,270 --> 01:16:05,625
Have another cookie my dear.

913
01:16:15,750 --> 01:16:19,220
We're here to tell you what we're
telling all the families in this town.

914
01:16:19,350 --> 01:16:20,783
All contracts are off...

915
01:16:20,910 --> 01:16:23,265
until we get who ever killed
Captain Calhain's wife.

916
01:16:24,390 --> 01:16:26,028
How do you mean Davey?

917
01:16:26,150 --> 01:16:30,462
It means nothing is happening.
We're coming down hard on you.

918
01:16:31,030 --> 01:16:33,339
A police captains' wife
has been murdered.

919
01:16:34,110 --> 01:16:36,226
You got narcotics right?

920
01:16:36,350 --> 01:16:37,908
Plus loan sharking.

921
01:16:38,030 --> 01:16:41,500
Plus horse books, football,
basketball and boxing.

922
01:16:42,110 --> 01:16:44,988
Not to mention what you take out of
restaurants in the trucking business.

923
01:16:45,110 --> 01:16:47,066
Plus a couple of millions
in TV sets...

924
01:16:47,190 --> 01:16:49,624
that fall of the back of a truck
every week.

925
01:16:49,870 --> 01:16:53,067
We're gonna put them all out of
business, as of now.

926
01:16:54,550 --> 01:16:56,541
It'll cost us hundreds of thousands...

927
01:16:56,630 --> 01:16:58,461
but that the way it's gonna be.

928
01:16:59,270 --> 01:17:02,580
I've been doing business with
the Police commissioners squad.

929
01:17:02,670 --> 01:17:04,069
For over 40 years now.

930
01:17:04,870 --> 01:17:06,508
We always went under one rule:

931
01:17:06,590 --> 01:17:08,626
You take our money,
you leave us alone.

932
01:17:09,790 --> 01:17:13,226
The more pressure you put on us
the more money you cost yourselves.

933
01:17:14,030 --> 01:17:15,668
There ain't a cop on the squad...

934
01:17:15,750 --> 01:17:18,822
who's had to get by on straight
police pay for a long time.

935
01:17:19,390 --> 01:17:21,142
Yeah.

936
01:17:21,630 --> 01:17:25,543
Look Angelo, our people don't like
this any better than you do.

937
01:17:25,670 --> 01:17:27,945
But this one's a point of honour
with us.

938
01:17:28,070 --> 01:17:29,628
Do you understand that Angelo?

939
01:17:54,750 --> 01:17:57,628
You're a fine looking woman.

940
01:17:58,510 --> 01:18:01,263
Charley Partanna is a lucky man.

941
01:18:02,150 --> 01:18:04,425
Thank you for coming.

942
01:18:05,430 --> 01:18:09,389
What a surprise you gave us
with this sudden wedding.

943
01:18:09,550 --> 01:18:12,508
Well, we just sort of swept
each other away.

944
01:18:13,110 --> 01:18:16,341
I understand,
I was young once.

945
01:18:17,270 --> 01:18:18,225
This...

946
01:18:18,870 --> 01:18:23,261
marriage of yours
has troubled me.

947
01:18:24,910 --> 01:18:26,628
Why Don Corrado?

948
01:18:26,790 --> 01:18:30,100
The people at Prizzi's place
in Vegas...

949
01:18:30,230 --> 01:18:32,221
have looked at pictures of you.

950
01:18:32,350 --> 01:18:35,023
They've told us that
you killed Louis Palo.

951
01:18:40,230 --> 01:18:43,620
Now, under ordinary
circumstances...

952
01:18:43,750 --> 01:18:45,866
you would have to be punished...

953
01:18:45,990 --> 01:18:50,142
cause those who steal must pay.

954
01:18:50,950 --> 01:18:53,908
You're the wife of my God son.

955
01:18:54,310 --> 01:18:59,589
I've searched to find some way
to show you clemency.

956
01:19:00,550 --> 01:19:02,063
What can I do?

957
01:19:02,310 --> 01:19:05,700
Well you got the other half of
the 720 dollars?

958
01:19:06,510 --> 01:19:07,465
Yes.

959
01:19:07,590 --> 01:19:09,626
Was Charley in this with you?

960
01:19:09,750 --> 01:19:10,705
No.

961
01:19:11,750 --> 01:19:14,787
He believed me when I told him
the half was Marxie's split.

962
01:19:14,910 --> 01:19:18,061
He didn't know that I had anything
to do with it or that I killed Louis.

963
01:19:18,190 --> 01:19:20,226
Good.

964
01:19:20,870 --> 01:19:22,940
Now you have five days...

965
01:19:24,590 --> 01:19:28,902
to get the 360 together,
give them back...

966
01:19:30,030 --> 01:19:33,466
together with
a 50 percent penalty...

967
01:19:33,590 --> 01:19:35,069
for what you have done to us.

968
01:19:35,790 --> 01:19:39,339
Will five days be enough time
for you?

969
01:19:39,510 --> 01:19:40,465
Five days?

970
01:19:41,510 --> 01:19:44,024
Yeah, I can get it together
in five days.

971
01:19:52,950 --> 01:19:53,985
Irene?

972
01:19:54,470 --> 01:19:55,903
Charley.

973
01:19:58,430 --> 01:19:59,749
How come you're in L. A?

974
01:19:59,910 --> 01:20:02,185
I had business to attend to,
didn't you see my note?

975
01:20:02,950 --> 01:20:04,702
Can you get out here this weekend?

976
01:20:06,030 --> 01:20:07,827
I don't think so.

977
01:20:11,390 --> 01:20:12,379
Tell me.

978
01:20:13,310 --> 01:20:14,629
Tell you what.

979
01:20:15,190 --> 01:20:16,623
Tell me I love you.

980
01:20:18,590 --> 01:20:19,864
I love you.

981
01:20:19,990 --> 01:20:23,187
Love you too, and it's real.

982
01:20:23,310 --> 01:20:26,461
May not be scientific, but it's real.

983
01:20:27,230 --> 01:20:28,379
Scientific?

984
01:20:29,630 --> 01:20:33,020
I read it in a magazine.
According to a doctor...

985
01:20:33,150 --> 01:20:34,788
everyone is trying to get...

986
01:20:34,910 --> 01:20:37,868
what they thought
they needed from their mothers...

987
01:20:37,990 --> 01:20:39,389
but they didn't get it.

988
01:20:41,390 --> 01:20:43,460
I don't even remember my mother.

989
01:20:43,590 --> 01:20:45,979
That's the amazing part.

990
01:20:46,550 --> 01:20:49,508
There's something in you
that knows anyways.

991
01:20:49,630 --> 01:20:51,222
The magazine said so.

992
01:20:51,790 --> 01:20:53,428
That's what love is.

993
01:20:53,870 --> 01:20:57,180
When you find someone
who'll give you...

994
01:20:57,510 --> 01:21:00,786
what you think you wanted
when you were a baby...

995
01:21:01,110 --> 01:21:02,589
but you didn't get it.

996
01:21:02,710 --> 01:21:03,745
A doctor wrote this.

997
01:21:04,950 --> 01:21:07,180
Charley forget doctors.

998
01:21:08,070 --> 01:21:10,868
Better yet,
lets play doctor.

999
01:21:13,350 --> 01:21:15,625
On the phone?

1000
01:21:18,310 --> 01:21:22,747
Doctor Partanna
I have this itch...

1001
01:21:23,230 --> 01:21:24,663
Well?

1002
01:22:14,870 --> 01:22:16,747
They're not kidding around
this time.

1003
01:22:17,790 --> 01:22:19,621
It's gonna get worse.

1004
01:22:20,790 --> 01:22:23,748
They're gonna keep leaning on us...

1005
01:22:23,910 --> 01:22:25,707
until we give them whoever it was...

1006
01:22:25,830 --> 01:22:27,946
that hit that Cops wife.

1007
01:22:28,430 --> 01:22:30,466
All I know is that...

1008
01:22:31,870 --> 01:22:33,064
the cops tell us...

1009
01:22:33,190 --> 01:22:37,422
the guy who got snatched the day
they did the number on the cops wife...

1010
01:22:37,790 --> 01:22:43,422
was in big business
with the Prizzi family.

1011
01:22:46,910 --> 01:22:48,866
I wanna make this a short meet.

1012
01:22:49,670 --> 01:22:51,786
I wanna put it to a vote right now...

1013
01:22:53,390 --> 01:22:55,028
that Dominic Prizzi...

1014
01:22:56,230 --> 01:22:58,869
tells us what the hell
he's gonna do about it.

1015
01:22:59,510 --> 01:23:00,625
Alright?

1016
01:23:01,670 --> 01:23:03,103
Raise your hands.

1017
01:23:05,150 --> 01:23:07,141
Hold the hands.

1018
01:23:09,310 --> 01:23:11,744
Who do you think
you're talking to?

1019
01:23:13,430 --> 01:23:15,386
I am Dominic Prizzi.

1020
01:23:16,950 --> 01:23:20,579
When most of you people was walking
around with holes in your pants...

1021
01:23:20,710 --> 01:23:22,940
I was holding up gas stations.

1022
01:23:23,910 --> 01:23:26,629
We was the biggest family
in the country.

1023
01:23:27,710 --> 01:23:31,749
And now most of you have figured out
how to push broads...

1024
01:23:32,270 --> 01:23:34,101
we're still the biggest.

1025
01:23:34,630 --> 01:23:37,508
We lose more when the cops
get in an uproar...

1026
01:23:37,670 --> 01:23:39,103
than any of you.

1027
01:23:39,910 --> 01:23:41,787
Now we don't like it...

1028
01:23:42,910 --> 01:23:46,619
but you ain't gonna tell us
how to run our business.

1029
01:23:47,670 --> 01:23:51,060
We ain't taking any shit
from any outsiders...

1030
01:23:51,190 --> 01:23:53,545
about the family business...

1031
01:23:55,790 --> 01:24:03,549
especially from a scummy little pimp
like you, Señor Bocca.

1032
01:24:17,310 --> 01:24:20,143
I hope you like it!

1033
01:24:24,190 --> 01:24:25,509
Thank you.

1034
01:24:31,470 --> 01:24:35,782
Padrino, you never saw anything
like this here...

1035
01:24:36,590 --> 01:24:39,866
the broad pushes the wrong button
on the elevator.

1036
01:24:39,990 --> 01:24:42,140
The door drops just in the minute...

1037
01:24:42,310 --> 01:24:45,063
when the second man drops
the bodyguard.

1038
01:24:45,190 --> 01:24:46,862
The woman is standing there.

1039
01:24:47,470 --> 01:24:49,108
She makes all three of us.

1040
01:24:50,310 --> 01:24:52,904
She had to go.

1041
01:24:53,150 --> 01:24:56,938
I'm sure you didn't act
without thinking.

1042
01:24:57,230 --> 01:25:00,142
That's why I called you here today.

1043
01:25:00,310 --> 01:25:02,778
You're a thinker.

1044
01:25:05,310 --> 01:25:08,347
Dominic is a sick man...

1045
01:25:09,670 --> 01:25:12,343
and the return of
his daughter brought him no ease.

1046
01:25:12,510 --> 01:25:14,501
He has got older.

1047
01:25:15,030 --> 01:25:17,669
I'm gonna move Dominic out
to Vegas...

1048
01:25:17,870 --> 01:25:20,179
and make you boss.

1049
01:25:28,630 --> 01:25:31,986
I'm speechless Padrino.

1050
01:25:39,070 --> 01:25:40,503
This...

1051
01:25:40,790 --> 01:25:42,109
is an honour...

1052
01:25:44,310 --> 01:25:46,221
beyond my dreams.

1053
01:25:48,910 --> 01:25:51,060
What could I do to show
my gratitude?

1054
01:25:51,190 --> 01:25:54,785
For the time being
this must be our secret.

1055
01:25:54,910 --> 01:25:57,344
You must not even tell your father.

1056
01:26:01,590 --> 01:26:04,104
I don't understand Padrino.

1057
01:26:04,190 --> 01:26:09,105
We'll announce everything once
the Filargi thing is settled.

1058
01:26:09,390 --> 01:26:15,181
Then Dominic will move out
and you'll move in.

1059
01:26:37,670 --> 01:26:39,865
God, I missed you.

1060
01:26:41,390 --> 01:26:43,267
So I gathered.

1061
01:26:45,390 --> 01:26:47,028
What's been happening?

1062
01:26:49,390 --> 01:26:50,618
Plenty.

1063
01:26:52,350 --> 01:26:54,386
Just had a meeting with the Don.

1064
01:26:55,350 --> 01:26:56,942
A private audience.

1065
01:26:58,630 --> 01:26:59,824
Here.

1066
01:27:01,870 --> 01:27:03,542
He wants me to take over.

1067
01:27:03,790 --> 01:27:06,145
He says that Dominic is sick.

1068
01:27:06,310 --> 01:27:07,982
They're gonna send him to Vegas.

1069
01:27:08,190 --> 01:27:09,669
I'm gonna be the boss.

1070
01:27:09,790 --> 01:27:11,189
Charley,
that's fantastic.

1071
01:27:11,310 --> 01:27:12,823
I don't know.

1072
01:27:13,590 --> 01:27:15,182
Sounds fishy to me.

1073
01:27:17,830 --> 01:27:19,149
Number one...

1074
01:27:20,790 --> 01:27:23,145
should have been Dominic
told me...

1075
01:27:24,190 --> 01:27:25,543
instead of the Don.

1076
01:27:25,670 --> 01:27:28,503
Well maybe the Don hasn't broken
the news to Dominic yet?

1077
01:27:29,710 --> 01:27:31,268
Whether he has or he hasn't...

1078
01:27:31,790 --> 01:27:33,701
he would have told Pop.

1079
01:27:34,550 --> 01:27:38,623
He don't decide what Mass to go to
unless he talks to Pop.

1080
01:27:39,630 --> 01:27:43,145
Big deal like this they'd go over
every angle fifteen times.

1081
01:27:44,750 --> 01:27:46,024
They didn't?

1082
01:27:46,110 --> 01:27:47,145
No.

1083
01:27:47,470 --> 01:27:48,789
And worse than that.

1084
01:27:49,510 --> 01:27:53,185
The Don says for me not to tell Pop.

1085
01:27:53,950 --> 01:27:55,941
Wanna know what I think, Irene?

1086
01:27:56,070 --> 01:27:57,105
What?

1087
01:28:01,150 --> 01:28:03,186
I think they're setting me up.

1088
01:28:09,830 --> 01:28:11,741
I think you're right Charley.

1089
01:28:11,870 --> 01:28:13,826
I think they're after our scalps.

1090
01:28:14,110 --> 01:28:15,668
How do you know?

1091
01:28:16,750 --> 01:28:18,502
I gotta a couple of things to tell you.

1092
01:28:20,190 --> 01:28:22,499
I went out to L. A on orders
of the Don.

1093
01:28:22,790 --> 01:28:24,701
He told me to bring back the money
I took from Louis Palo...

1094
01:28:24,830 --> 01:28:26,741
plus 50 percent interest.

1095
01:28:26,870 --> 01:28:29,179
So you did ice Louis Palo.

1096
01:28:29,350 --> 01:28:31,739
You swore to me that you didn't.
You lied to me.

1097
01:28:31,870 --> 01:28:33,940
I lied to you because
you wanted me to.

1098
01:28:34,070 --> 01:28:35,947
I only told you what
you wanted to be true.

1099
01:28:36,030 --> 01:28:38,066
And I told the Don
it was all my doing.

1100
01:28:38,190 --> 01:28:39,987
Jesus Charley, I'm so sorry.

1101
01:28:44,350 --> 01:28:46,864
What's the other thing you got to tell
me?

1102
01:28:47,350 --> 01:28:49,864
Dominic has put out
a contract on you.

1103
01:28:50,750 --> 01:28:53,264
What are you fucking nuts?

1104
01:28:53,470 --> 01:28:55,665
No, Charley,
I'm the contractor.

1105
01:28:58,110 --> 01:29:00,908
Dominic hires my own wife
to clip me?

1106
01:29:01,230 --> 01:29:03,619
Charley he didn't know
I was your wife.

1107
01:29:03,830 --> 01:29:05,548
He just wanted the best.

1108
01:29:07,350 --> 01:29:08,385
Charley!

1109
01:29:08,710 --> 01:29:11,827
Honey,
let's go to Hong Kong tonight.

1110
01:29:12,390 --> 01:29:14,108
What are you talking about?

1111
01:29:14,230 --> 01:29:16,186
Let's beat it while we still can.

1112
01:29:16,310 --> 01:29:17,299
Beat it?

1113
01:29:17,430 --> 01:29:20,149
Yeah, scram, split,
let's make a run for it.

1114
01:29:20,270 --> 01:29:22,830
Look I know this guy in Hong Kong
who can give us...

1115
01:29:22,910 --> 01:29:24,468
new prints even new faces
in a few days.

1116
01:29:24,630 --> 01:29:27,064
We can get out of this crazy world,
we can start fresh.

1117
01:29:27,150 --> 01:29:29,664
We can be together all the time.

1118
01:29:29,790 --> 01:29:30,745
Hong Kong?

1119
01:29:30,870 --> 01:29:32,986
Hong Kong, Brazil, South Africa.

1120
01:29:33,510 --> 01:29:35,740
It doesn't matter.
What matters is us together.

1121
01:29:36,470 --> 01:29:40,509
Listen, I've been doing three four
hits a year for the last few years.

1122
01:29:40,630 --> 01:29:42,029
Most of them full pay.

1123
01:29:43,750 --> 01:29:45,263
That many?

1124
01:29:45,510 --> 01:29:48,866
Well it's not many if you consider
the size of the population.

1125
01:29:49,390 --> 01:29:52,746
The thing is
I got almost a million.

1126
01:29:52,870 --> 01:29:55,384
In a safe deposit box on the coast.

1127
01:29:55,510 --> 01:29:57,501
You must have at least
that much put away.

1128
01:29:57,630 --> 01:29:59,109
We can take all the money
and make a run for it.

1129
01:29:59,190 --> 01:30:01,021
We can go where we want,
do what we want...

1130
01:30:01,110 --> 01:30:02,907
we can be together
all the time.

1131
01:30:03,030 --> 01:30:05,544
Please Charley let's just go
before they get us.

1132
01:30:05,670 --> 01:30:07,501
They're not gonna get us.

1133
01:30:07,630 --> 01:30:10,064
Piss on the Prizzi's.

1134
01:30:10,790 --> 01:30:13,384
These people can't win all the time.

1135
01:30:13,630 --> 01:30:15,860
There has to be a way to beat them.
Bastards.

1136
01:30:20,870 --> 01:30:22,701
Let's call Pop.

1137
01:30:24,390 --> 01:30:28,383
And the Don told you to keep
making you boss a secret from me?

1138
01:30:28,550 --> 01:30:29,505
Yeah.

1139
01:30:29,630 --> 01:30:34,385
And he told you he's letting you off
for giving him back the money?

1140
01:30:34,670 --> 01:30:36,262
Plus fifty percent.

1141
01:30:37,390 --> 01:30:41,019
And Dominic gave you a fifty dollar
down payment to hit Charley?

1142
01:30:41,190 --> 01:30:43,624
Absolutely.
Brand new bills.

1143
01:30:55,030 --> 01:30:56,588
Oh, he's hot.

1144
01:30:56,750 --> 01:30:58,627
I ain't never seen him this hot.

1145
01:31:16,550 --> 01:31:20,304
It's just business, just business.

1146
01:31:21,110 --> 01:31:22,589
What are we gonna do?

1147
01:31:22,710 --> 01:31:25,429
We have to take away the only thing
the Don wants,

1148
01:31:25,550 --> 01:31:27,780
Filargi.

1149
01:31:27,990 --> 01:31:31,460
You have to snatch Filargi again
This time from the Prizzi's.

1150
01:31:31,590 --> 01:31:33,865
How many people you got out there
holding him down?

1151
01:31:33,990 --> 01:31:34,945
Two.

1152
01:31:35,070 --> 01:31:37,026
My people,
they do whatever I tell them.

1153
01:31:37,150 --> 01:31:38,105
Good.

1154
01:31:38,230 --> 01:31:41,779
Filargi is worth seventy million,
maybe more to the Prizzi's.

1155
01:31:42,350 --> 01:31:44,068
Including the bank.

1156
01:31:44,430 --> 01:31:47,342
So what are you next to
seventy million dollars?

1157
01:31:47,470 --> 01:31:48,425
Nothing.

1158
01:31:48,550 --> 01:31:50,700
They'll take whatever deal
you offer them.

1159
01:31:50,830 --> 01:31:51,979
Yeah, no choice right.

1160
01:31:52,110 --> 01:31:56,388
They know we can let Filargi
go and testify against them.

1161
01:31:56,590 --> 01:31:58,148
Or even worse...

1162
01:31:58,990 --> 01:32:00,218
you can try and go into...

1163
01:32:00,350 --> 01:32:02,705
the Governments
witness protection programme...

1164
01:32:02,830 --> 01:32:05,424
and testify against
the Don and Dominic.

1165
01:32:05,710 --> 01:32:08,668
To a jury the colds facts would be
you shot the Captains wife...

1166
01:32:08,790 --> 01:32:12,942
on orders from the Don and Dominic
after they hired you for 150 dollars.

1167
01:32:14,430 --> 01:32:17,263
You're very dangerous to the Prizzi's,
Irene.

1168
01:32:17,630 --> 01:32:18,585
Yeah.

1169
01:32:18,830 --> 01:32:22,948
It could turn out to be a good thing
Irene zipped the police captains wife.

1170
01:32:23,390 --> 01:32:25,665
It could solve all our problems.

1171
01:33:21,390 --> 01:33:25,144
We're here tonight to honour
my son.

1172
01:33:25,870 --> 01:33:27,462
He's gonna leave us...

1173
01:33:27,830 --> 01:33:31,584
to live in a 935 dollar
house...

1174
01:33:31,670 --> 01:33:36,539
next to his own golf course
in Las Vegas, Nevada.

1175
01:33:38,750 --> 01:33:43,107
And I said to him,
from you, from my heart...

1176
01:33:43,870 --> 01:33:45,701
God speed you!

1177
01:33:47,430 --> 01:33:50,069
God bless you Dominic!

1178
01:33:53,830 --> 01:33:55,866
And I want to present you...

1179
01:33:55,990 --> 01:34:00,984
with these tokens of esteem
from your entire family.

1180
01:34:01,910 --> 01:34:04,504
Some going away presents.

1181
01:34:10,710 --> 01:34:13,861
A complete set of
Stealing silver golf clubs.

1182
01:34:16,430 --> 01:34:19,263
That bag is made out of the hide
of an elephant.

1183
01:34:19,390 --> 01:34:21,665
It's the only one
in the United States.

1184
01:34:22,390 --> 01:34:26,622
And one thousand of your favourite
Mexican cigars.

1185
01:34:27,550 --> 01:34:30,383
We're gonna have a song...

1186
01:34:30,550 --> 01:34:33,348
in celebration of this grand
occasion...

1187
01:34:33,470 --> 01:34:35,904
the great Tenor
Tomas Innovarata.

1188
01:35:24,550 --> 01:35:25,619
Get moving.

1189
01:35:30,030 --> 01:35:32,863
Holy shit boss.
Somebody done the job on Fingo.

1190
01:36:21,990 --> 01:36:24,424
The Bocca's.

1191
01:36:24,790 --> 01:36:30,342
This killing of the Police captain's
wife is costing us all too much.

1192
01:36:38,470 --> 01:36:40,506
I got something to read to you.

1193
01:36:41,990 --> 01:36:43,582
It's a letter.

1194
01:36:43,710 --> 01:36:46,270
A letter?
Who from?

1195
01:36:47,550 --> 01:36:49,108
Charley.

1196
01:36:51,470 --> 01:36:53,142
You all set?

1197
01:36:56,750 --> 01:36:58,342
Dear Eduardo...

1198
01:36:58,550 --> 01:37:01,542
You're probably hot right now
cause we took Filargi.

1199
01:37:02,150 --> 01:37:03,549
But when you hear
the reason why...

1200
01:37:03,870 --> 01:37:07,419
you and the Don are gonna understand
there was no other way we could go.

1201
01:37:08,310 --> 01:37:11,780
Dominic put out a contract on me.

1202
01:37:16,110 --> 01:37:17,338
He's a fucking liar!

1203
01:37:17,470 --> 01:37:20,268
You wanna hear the letter,
listen don't talk.

1204
01:37:20,430 --> 01:37:22,227
There's a 130 million dollars here
maybe more.

1205
01:37:22,550 --> 01:37:24,745
We've gotta renegotiate it
before we get it back.

1206
01:37:24,870 --> 01:37:27,862
Just shut up and listen.
Go on, sit down.

1207
01:37:28,230 --> 01:37:29,424
Go on.

1208
01:37:32,990 --> 01:37:35,026
Dominic will say
it's a lot of bullshit.

1209
01:37:37,910 --> 01:37:40,504
It so happens
he hired my own wife...

1210
01:37:40,630 --> 01:37:42,825
and gave her a down payment
of 50,000 dollars.

1211
01:37:43,590 --> 01:37:46,627
And my wife is sitting right next
to me and she's laughing like hell.

1212
01:37:47,510 --> 01:37:50,866
I personally think the Don found
Dominic on a doorstep...

1213
01:37:51,190 --> 01:37:54,341
because he's too dumb
to be a Prizzi.

1214
01:38:01,950 --> 01:38:05,465
The first thing I gotta have
before you get Filargi back...

1215
01:38:06,030 --> 01:38:08,464
is that you deliver
Dominic to me...

1216
01:38:08,910 --> 01:38:11,424
where I tell you
and when I tell you.

1217
01:38:11,550 --> 01:38:14,701
This time no contract,
I'll kill him myself.

1218
01:38:15,110 --> 01:38:16,987
Listen to the letter will ya' Dominic?

1219
01:38:17,110 --> 01:38:18,065
Come on.

1220
01:38:24,910 --> 01:38:27,219
For the main money
this is what I want.

1221
01:38:28,190 --> 01:38:31,865
23,014 dollars for expenses.

1222
01:38:32,790 --> 01:38:34,940
Then 50 dollars for my helper.

1223
01:38:36,310 --> 01:38:38,778
Of course the 150 dollars
that was promised my wife...

1224
01:38:38,950 --> 01:38:41,100
as second man in the Filargi scam.

1225
01:38:42,230 --> 01:38:44,505
Charley's wife was the second man?

1226
01:38:44,670 --> 01:38:47,548
She was the only way
we could take out the bodyguard.

1227
01:38:47,910 --> 01:38:50,663
Then I want all the insurance coverage
on Filargi's kidnap policy...

1228
01:38:50,790 --> 01:38:52,542
which is two million five.

1229
01:38:52,670 --> 01:38:55,821
- My God he's a real businessman.
- That's my boy.

1230
01:38:56,070 --> 01:38:58,459
We gotta make him an offer and
eventually we settle.

1231
01:38:59,790 --> 01:39:03,578
The way I see it, we get about
60 or 70 million dollars...

1232
01:39:03,670 --> 01:39:05,467
with about 5.9º/º sales costs...

1233
01:39:05,550 --> 01:39:08,383
if we give Charley everything he wants,
which we obviously won't.

1234
01:39:08,510 --> 01:39:11,422
And I am part of
the fucking sales cost.

1235
01:39:12,030 --> 01:39:13,588
Dominic...

1236
01:39:13,670 --> 01:39:15,820
take some blood pressure medicine,
will ya?

1237
01:39:16,190 --> 01:39:18,181
Charley is just making a point.

1238
01:39:18,470 --> 01:39:20,267
Everything is negotiable.

1239
01:39:21,710 --> 01:39:23,428
We go over to Poppa's...

1240
01:39:24,470 --> 01:39:26,188
we hash this thing out.

1241
01:39:27,310 --> 01:39:30,347
Come on!
Let's go!

1242
01:41:02,710 --> 01:41:05,304
- Somebody is dead?
- Yes,

1243
01:41:05,430 --> 01:41:08,103
Who?
Who's dead?

1244
01:41:08,550 --> 01:41:10,506
Poppa...

1245
01:41:10,990 --> 01:41:12,708
Dominic.

1246
01:41:17,830 --> 01:41:20,105
The Bocca's again.

1247
01:41:26,470 --> 01:41:29,223
Oh Dominic!

1248
01:41:31,470 --> 01:41:34,860
He got old!

1249
01:41:36,590 --> 01:41:39,627
Maybe it was his daughter,
who knows.

1250
01:41:41,870 --> 01:41:44,179
I agreed to retire him...

1251
01:41:44,790 --> 01:41:47,463
and I gave his job to Charley.

1252
01:41:48,390 --> 01:41:52,224
I told him to keep this secret
a little while...

1253
01:41:52,870 --> 01:41:54,701
until...

1254
01:41:54,830 --> 01:41:58,027
Dominic's banquet.

1255
01:41:58,630 --> 01:42:01,667
Now Charley is all mixed up...

1256
01:42:01,790 --> 01:42:03,382
and we gotta get him back.

1257
01:42:03,790 --> 01:42:07,146
Only Charley can hold everything
together here.

1258
01:42:23,830 --> 01:42:24,945
How you doing Pop?

1259
01:42:25,110 --> 01:42:27,670
Fine, everything alright?

1260
01:42:27,910 --> 01:42:30,424
Yeah, everything's quiet out here.

1261
01:42:30,550 --> 01:42:31,949
That's better huh.

1262
01:42:34,190 --> 01:42:36,146
Sorry to drag you out here...

1263
01:42:36,270 --> 01:42:38,909
but I didn't want anyone
taking a pot shot at me.

1264
01:42:39,190 --> 01:42:41,988
When I told the Don about Dominic
putting out contract on you...

1265
01:42:42,110 --> 01:42:43,225
it knocked him out.

1266
01:42:43,310 --> 01:42:44,265
He couldn't believe it.

1267
01:42:44,870 --> 01:42:47,942
He told me with tears in his eyes
that he gotta straighten all this out.

1268
01:42:50,950 --> 01:42:53,020
He wasn't setting me up?

1269
01:42:53,910 --> 01:42:55,025
He said...

1270
01:42:55,150 --> 01:42:58,540
and I've known him for fifty years,
so it's like looking through his heart.

1271
01:42:58,830 --> 01:43:01,583
He said:
"We need Charley".

1272
01:43:03,430 --> 01:43:04,829
Oh, he said that?

1273
01:43:05,630 --> 01:43:08,269
The Don and me
don't have much time left.

1274
01:43:08,390 --> 01:43:10,187
The family has to keep going.

1275
01:43:10,390 --> 01:43:12,267
You're the only one that can run it.

1276
01:43:14,710 --> 01:43:16,541
Then everything is ok.

1277
01:43:16,670 --> 01:43:19,184
We don't have to hang on to Filargi.

1278
01:43:19,310 --> 01:43:21,380
The Don gave me his guarantee.

1279
01:43:23,830 --> 01:43:26,185
Tomorrow morning at 10 o'clock,
you bring Filargi...

1280
01:43:26,270 --> 01:43:28,545
at 42nd Street library
and let him out.

1281
01:43:28,950 --> 01:43:32,022
I'll tip off the cops and the FBI.
They'll be in his hotel room.

1282
01:43:33,230 --> 01:43:35,221
Ok Pop, want the paper?

1283
01:43:35,350 --> 01:43:37,102
Na, read it from cover to cover.

1284
01:43:37,230 --> 01:43:39,107
Jupiter was 6 at Vermont.

1285
01:43:39,870 --> 01:43:41,223
Ok.

1286
01:43:41,350 --> 01:43:43,910
By the way,
the insurance company paid off.

1287
01:43:45,270 --> 01:43:46,828
Take care of yourself Charley.

1288
01:44:00,110 --> 01:44:01,702
How are we gonna take Filargi in?

1289
01:44:02,790 --> 01:44:06,021
Pop's sending someone up on
the Palace to meet us.

1290
01:44:07,510 --> 01:44:10,547
We'll transfer him into the van
and I'll drive him into the city.

1291
01:44:10,710 --> 01:44:12,587
You stick with the plumber.

1292
01:44:12,710 --> 01:44:14,541
He'll drop you off at the apartment.

1293
01:44:16,590 --> 01:44:18,262
Tell me about the money Charley.

1294
01:44:20,550 --> 01:44:22,541
My end is 2,5 million...

1295
01:44:22,670 --> 01:44:24,422
plus I'm boss of the Prizzi's...

1296
01:44:24,590 --> 01:44:27,866
with heavy points in everything
the family does.

1297
01:44:29,990 --> 01:44:33,869
This time next week
we'll have all the money.

1298
01:44:33,990 --> 01:44:36,550
You mean to tell me you're gonna
turn over a hole ball of wax...

1299
01:44:36,670 --> 01:44:39,389
to some Sicilians who are gonna pay
you what they owe you next week.

1300
01:44:40,710 --> 01:44:42,701
Honey I'm the boss.
They need me.

1301
01:44:42,950 --> 01:44:45,510
I gotta believe Pop.

1302
01:44:45,590 --> 01:44:47,467
They're not gonna screw us over now.

1303
01:44:48,550 --> 01:44:50,461
Well maybe Pop is in there
looking after your interests...

1304
01:44:50,630 --> 01:44:53,098
but that doesn't necessarily mean
he's looking after mine.

1305
01:44:53,910 --> 01:44:56,583
There is a real pressure to turn over
the second man.

1306
01:44:57,590 --> 01:44:59,182
You're my wife.

1307
01:44:59,310 --> 01:45:01,187
I'm your Polak wife.

1308
01:45:01,790 --> 01:45:04,099
Irene will you shape up, jees.

1309
01:45:04,990 --> 01:45:09,905
Ok, I'll shape up as soon as I get
my 900 dollars.

1310
01:45:11,990 --> 01:45:13,662
What 900 dollars?

1311
01:45:14,190 --> 01:45:16,784
The $720 from the Vegas scam...

1312
01:45:16,910 --> 01:45:19,265
plus the $180 that
Don made me pay as penalty.

1313
01:45:19,390 --> 01:45:22,541
That's 900 dollars.
I just want what's mine.

1314
01:45:23,870 --> 01:45:27,499
That's Prizzi money honey, not yours.
You stole.

1315
01:45:27,870 --> 01:45:30,338
The Prizzi's got theirs back
from the insurance company.

1316
01:45:30,470 --> 01:45:31,585
Now I just want it back.

1317
01:45:31,910 --> 01:45:35,027
That ain't gonna make no sense
to the Prizzi's, honey.

1318
01:45:35,390 --> 01:45:38,621
Remember the words of the late,
great Marxie Heller.

1319
01:45:38,870 --> 01:45:42,658
We'd rather eat our children
than part with money.

1320
01:45:43,110 --> 01:45:45,305
Remember those words, honey.

1321
01:45:45,590 --> 01:45:46,909
I am Charley, I am.

1322
01:45:58,350 --> 01:45:59,783
Mr Filargi...

1323
01:46:01,190 --> 01:46:03,909
you were born a poor kid
in Naples right?

1324
01:46:04,030 --> 01:46:05,099
Yeah that's right.

1325
01:46:06,150 --> 01:46:07,868
You remember the Camorra?

1326
01:46:09,910 --> 01:46:13,186
The Camorra was small,
we're very big.

1327
01:46:13,910 --> 01:46:16,026
There's no where's we can't go.

1328
01:46:16,710 --> 01:46:19,178
They could lock you
in a steel room...

1329
01:46:19,270 --> 01:46:21,386
in a submarine
at the bottom of the ocean.

1330
01:46:21,510 --> 01:46:22,659
And we'd still get to you.

1331
01:46:23,710 --> 01:46:26,019
The cops are gonna talk to you.

1332
01:46:26,350 --> 01:46:29,865
If you tell them anything about who
took you, or where they took you.

1333
01:46:29,990 --> 01:46:31,901
We're gonna kill you.

1334
01:46:32,310 --> 01:46:34,107
Capiche?

1335
01:46:34,230 --> 01:46:35,629
I understand.

1336
01:46:36,190 --> 01:46:37,908
Good.

1337
01:46:39,710 --> 01:46:42,383
You're free Mr. Filargi,
good luck.

1338
01:46:44,790 --> 01:46:46,143
Yeah.

1339
01:46:50,270 --> 01:46:52,738
I've forgotten the Prizzi's already.

1340
01:46:55,030 --> 01:46:57,339
I got a request to make...

1341
01:46:57,550 --> 01:46:58,778
or Irene has.

1342
01:47:01,470 --> 01:47:03,108
What kind of request Charley?

1343
01:47:03,390 --> 01:47:05,221
She wants her money back.

1344
01:47:05,950 --> 01:47:07,303
What money?

1345
01:47:07,430 --> 01:47:10,388
The 540 she gave you for the Don.

1346
01:47:10,630 --> 01:47:14,145
Plus the 360 I took the night
I zipped Marxie Heller.

1347
01:47:14,270 --> 01:47:15,225
That money.

1348
01:47:16,190 --> 01:47:17,908
She's willing to forget about...

1349
01:47:17,990 --> 01:47:20,504
2,5 million for Filargi's insurance...

1350
01:47:21,110 --> 01:47:25,467
and the rest of what Dominic
owed her for the contract on me.

1351
01:47:27,310 --> 01:47:29,824
But she wants her 900 back.

1352
01:47:36,710 --> 01:47:39,144
With all the respect Charley...

1353
01:47:39,790 --> 01:47:41,667
your wife must be cracked.

1354
01:47:42,070 --> 01:47:44,789
Try and see it from
her point of view.

1355
01:47:45,190 --> 01:47:47,784
I mean you agreed to all that stuff
in the letter we sent...

1356
01:47:47,950 --> 01:47:49,588
when we had Filargi.

1357
01:47:50,510 --> 01:47:52,626
You made a commitment, Pop.

1358
01:47:54,230 --> 01:47:57,540
And anyways,
it was Irene's move...

1359
01:47:57,630 --> 01:47:59,985
that got Filargi out
in the first place.

1360
01:48:00,510 --> 01:48:02,660
We're gonna get the bank.

1361
01:48:02,790 --> 01:48:05,588
So, 900 doesn't seem
like so much money

1362
01:48:05,750 --> 01:48:07,866
Irene figures
she got it coming to her.

1363
01:48:10,670 --> 01:48:15,107
I glad that she's so foolish
and grasping.

1364
01:48:15,190 --> 01:48:18,466
Makes it a little easier
what we gotta do.

1365
01:48:22,550 --> 01:48:26,384
The family has decided that...

1366
01:48:26,470 --> 01:48:28,779
we've got to give the second man
to the cops.

1367
01:48:32,750 --> 01:48:34,820
Give Irene to the cops?

1368
01:48:35,150 --> 01:48:38,142
The family decided that...

1369
01:48:38,270 --> 01:48:41,023
we got one week to give up
the second man...

1370
01:48:41,190 --> 01:48:43,101
or we'll be at war.

1371
01:48:43,270 --> 01:48:47,229
War will cost us everything we got.

1372
01:48:47,390 --> 01:48:50,268
And that could mean the end
of the family.

1373
01:48:51,510 --> 01:48:52,465
Well Padrino.

1374
01:48:52,590 --> 01:48:56,219
You should never have married a
woman who wasn't in the environment.

1375
01:48:56,310 --> 01:48:57,345
That wasn't smart.

1376
01:48:57,430 --> 01:48:59,341
Might have been alright
if she was straight.

1377
01:48:59,430 --> 01:49:00,704
But she wasn't.

1378
01:49:05,550 --> 01:49:07,745
She gotta go.

1379
01:49:08,310 --> 01:49:11,427
And you gotta do the job on her,
Charley.

1380
01:49:11,790 --> 01:49:15,669
You're the only one who can get
close enough to do it.

1381
01:49:15,750 --> 01:49:17,308
Zip Irene?

1382
01:49:18,470 --> 01:49:19,949
Clip Irene?

1383
01:49:20,150 --> 01:49:22,345
If they take her alive
they're gonna make her talk.

1384
01:49:22,510 --> 01:49:23,784
And if she talks...

1385
01:49:24,270 --> 01:49:27,068
she's gonna drag us all to jail...

1386
01:49:27,190 --> 01:49:28,669
maybe even to the chair.

1387
01:49:29,310 --> 01:49:32,302
Filargi will go free and
we'll never get the bank.

1388
01:49:32,470 --> 01:49:34,028
There's no choice here.

1389
01:49:38,110 --> 01:49:41,625
How is doing a number on Irene
gonna satisfy the cops...

1390
01:49:41,710 --> 01:49:43,826
about the broad that pushed
the wrong button?

1391
01:49:44,990 --> 01:49:48,062
Filargi will identify
your wife's body...

1392
01:49:48,230 --> 01:49:49,743
and there will be no-one
to question.

1393
01:49:50,710 --> 01:49:52,462
Everybody will get
what they want...

1394
01:49:52,590 --> 01:49:55,263
and we can all go back
to doing business.

1395
01:49:56,910 --> 01:49:59,140
But Padrino...

1396
01:49:59,710 --> 01:50:01,541
she's my wife.

1397
01:50:02,070 --> 01:50:03,389
I can't kill her.

1398
01:50:04,230 --> 01:50:06,027
Now, Charley...

1399
01:50:06,830 --> 01:50:11,950
you swore an oath of blood,
my blood and yours.

1400
01:50:12,110 --> 01:50:15,261
That you would always put
the family before...

1401
01:50:15,350 --> 01:50:17,659
anything else in your life.

1402
01:50:17,790 --> 01:50:20,065
I'm simply calling on you now...

1403
01:50:20,190 --> 01:50:22,340
to keep that sacred oath.

1404
01:50:25,310 --> 01:50:29,861
Irene is my family Padrino.
She's my wife.

1405
01:50:29,990 --> 01:50:33,300
She's a woman you've known
for only a few weeks.

1406
01:50:34,310 --> 01:50:35,868
She is your wife.

1407
01:50:36,110 --> 01:50:37,702
We are your life.

1408
01:50:37,830 --> 01:50:40,628
You're failing your oath...

1409
01:50:40,750 --> 01:50:44,868
when you covered up for her
in the Vegas scam.

1410
01:50:44,990 --> 01:50:50,747
A great sin
against your honour.

1411
01:50:51,790 --> 01:50:54,384
But this for this you must stone.

1412
01:50:54,590 --> 01:50:55,545
I need her.

1413
01:50:59,510 --> 01:51:01,626
Look at you's.

1414
01:51:03,070 --> 01:51:06,699
Pop, you've been alone
since Mamma died.

1415
01:51:08,190 --> 01:51:11,865
Padrino you've been alone
all my life.

1416
01:51:13,790 --> 01:51:16,702
Is that what you want for me,
to grow old like you?

1417
01:51:16,790 --> 01:51:22,023
With nothing but bodyguards and
money to keep me company?

1418
01:51:25,590 --> 01:51:28,184
Charley,
my beloved man.

1419
01:51:29,390 --> 01:51:31,858
You will be even more alone.

1420
01:51:32,750 --> 01:51:37,187
If you turn you back on us,
we are your blood.

1421
01:51:39,590 --> 01:51:42,821
Jees, I feel like I'm drowning
or something.

1422
01:51:44,430 --> 01:51:47,388
We covered up the Vegas scam
to protect her.

1423
01:51:47,910 --> 01:51:50,140
That's what I thought
we did for our women.

1424
01:51:50,230 --> 01:51:52,505
How can that be a sin
against honour?

1425
01:51:52,870 --> 01:51:55,748
She is a hitter and a thief.

1426
01:51:56,230 --> 01:51:58,380
You must give her to us.

1427
01:51:58,630 --> 01:52:00,427
What is your answer?

1428
01:52:33,110 --> 01:52:34,589
The family.

1429
01:52:35,630 --> 01:52:38,428
It's the only place I can be,
I know that.

1430
01:52:54,310 --> 01:52:57,666
It's business Charley, only business.

1431
01:53:19,070 --> 01:53:21,106
Irene?
Charley.

1432
01:53:22,350 --> 01:53:23,305
Hello.

1433
01:53:24,150 --> 01:53:25,583
Everything is ok.

1434
01:53:25,790 --> 01:53:28,065
The Don's gonna give you
your money back.

1435
01:53:28,190 --> 01:53:30,545
All 900 dollars, I got it right here.

1436
01:53:30,710 --> 01:53:32,541
The Don's giving money back?

1437
01:53:32,710 --> 01:53:33,699
Since when?

1438
01:53:33,830 --> 01:53:37,061
Yeah you could have knocked me
over.

1439
01:53:37,310 --> 01:53:38,663
That ain't all.

1440
01:53:38,910 --> 01:53:42,220
He's gonna pay you every dime
for Filargi's stand...

1441
01:53:43,470 --> 01:53:45,301
and what Dominic set.

1442
01:53:45,950 --> 01:53:47,463
How about that?

1443
01:53:47,590 --> 01:53:49,148
Oh, Charley!

1444
01:53:50,750 --> 01:53:51,865
Well...

1445
01:53:52,910 --> 01:53:54,787
I'm glad
everything is settled.

1446
01:53:56,670 --> 01:53:57,625
I just...

1447
01:53:58,710 --> 01:54:04,262
wanted you to know that
everything is a hundred percent ok.

1448
01:54:08,310 --> 01:54:12,861
Oh Marxie,
I should have listened.

1449
01:54:54,790 --> 01:54:59,068
After you take this stone out
of my shoe...

1450
01:54:59,990 --> 01:55:02,106
you call your father...

1451
01:55:02,230 --> 01:55:04,698
and tell him where he can get her.

1452
01:55:04,990 --> 01:55:08,221
And then the wind will stop blowing.

1453
01:55:08,950 --> 01:55:10,019
Charley...

1454
01:55:10,390 --> 01:55:12,620
you got 900,000 here.

1455
01:55:29,670 --> 01:55:33,140
What's the first flight out of L.A. To
Hong Kong in the morning?

1456
01:55:35,190 --> 01:55:37,943
Flight 009 at 10.45 am.

1457
01:55:38,070 --> 01:55:40,140
But we can get you to Hong Kong
tonight out of LA.

1458
01:55:40,270 --> 01:55:42,306
Oh no thank you I have to go
to the bank in the morning.

1459
01:55:42,430 --> 01:55:46,548
Reserve 009 then one seat, first class.
The name is Hilary Jackson.

1460
01:55:47,230 --> 01:55:48,822
Mrs. Hilary Jackson.

1461
01:56:33,590 --> 01:56:34,943
Irene?

1462
01:56:45,510 --> 01:56:46,829
Irene?

1463
01:57:39,790 --> 01:57:41,143
Irene?

1464
01:57:43,430 --> 01:57:44,658
Irene?

1465
01:57:44,990 --> 01:57:46,662
Look who's here.

1466
01:57:51,510 --> 01:57:55,264
Charley!
What a wonderful surprise!

1467
01:57:55,390 --> 01:57:57,267
Baby I got three whole days.

1468
01:57:57,390 --> 01:57:59,381
We can do anything you want.
You name it.

1469
01:58:02,590 --> 01:58:04,706
Baby we are gonna have a ball.

1470
01:58:37,030 --> 01:58:40,181
Jesus, what a beautiful song.

1471
01:58:41,870 --> 01:58:43,781
Why don't you go
and warm up the bed?

1472
01:58:43,910 --> 01:58:44,865
I'll be right there.

1473
01:58:47,350 --> 01:58:48,544
Yeah!

1474
02:00:44,550 --> 02:00:45,585
Mae?

1475
02:00:45,870 --> 02:00:47,098
Charley.

1476
02:00:47,190 --> 02:00:48,418
Charley, you know what?

1477
02:00:48,510 --> 02:00:52,264
My sister Theresa just got back
today from her honeymoon.

1478
02:00:53,230 --> 02:00:55,380
Where did they go?
Outer space?

1479
02:00:58,630 --> 02:00:59,983
What do you say...

1480
02:01:00,670 --> 02:01:02,945
we go to dinner tonight?

1481
02:01:03,190 --> 02:01:04,305
Dinner?

1482
02:01:06,830 --> 02:01:08,548
What do you mean?

1483
02:01:08,870 --> 02:01:09,825
What do I mean?

1484
02:01:09,950 --> 02:01:12,669
I mean let's go some place
and get something to eat.

1485
02:01:13,070 --> 02:01:14,549
You, me and Irene?

1486
02:01:14,630 --> 02:01:15,585
No.

1487
02:01:17,190 --> 02:01:18,509
Just you and me.

1488
02:01:19,230 --> 02:01:20,629
What about Irene?

1489
02:01:22,270 --> 02:01:25,580
She had to go away.
She won't be back.

1490
02:01:28,830 --> 02:01:29,979
How about it?

1491
02:01:30,070 --> 02:01:31,025
How about?

1492
02:01:31,790 --> 02:01:35,305
Holy cow, Charley.
Just tell me where you want to meet.
