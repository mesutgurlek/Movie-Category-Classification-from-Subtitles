you were coming.

me manager right after Christmas,

28

make the payments

the house.

30

Jimmy, you're not
coming in here.

JIMMY: We just need to
borrow your oven.

970
01:20:33,928 --> 01:20:37,130
THREE RIVERS: We have a situation
with a couple of smugglers.

971
01:20:37,198 --> 01:20:40,100
They tried to go across the river,
but their car went in.

972
01:20:40,167 --> 01:20:43,520
And now the troopers know that
they're on the reservation.

973
01:20:43,588 --> 01:20:45,054
ROSALIE: Who are they?

974
01:20:45,122 --> 01:20:47,256
Lila Littlewolf
and some white woman.

975
01:20:47,324 --> 01:20:48,892
ROSALIE: What do
the troopers want?

976
01:20:48,960 --> 01:20:51,161
They want the surrender
of the two illegals.

977
01:20:51,228 --> 01:20:54,614
Second, they want the surrender
of the non-native smuggler.

978
01:20:54,681 --> 01:20:57,266
They really mean to set
an example over here.

979
01:20:57,334 --> 01:20:58,584
Do you know
where they are?

980
01:20:58,652 --> 01:21:00,820
Yeah. They're probably
over at Velma's.

981
01:21:00,888 --> 01:21:02,572
ROSALIE: What about
Lila Littlewolf?

982
01:21:02,640 --> 01:21:05,592
You can't start throwing
Mohawks off the rez, Rosalie.

983
01:21:05,659 --> 01:21:07,844
She's got a Mohawk son.

984
01:21:07,912 --> 01:21:09,846
She cost us a Mohawk son.

985
01:21:09,914 --> 01:21:11,148
BERNIE:
Jake was a big boy.

986
01:21:11,215 --> 01:21:12,683
He knew what
he was doing.

Hi, Bernie.

995
01:22:40,805 --> 01:22:42,221
You're in big trouble.

996
01:22:42,289 --> 01:22:44,357
The Council voted
to expel you.

997
01:22:44,424 --> 01:22:46,443
Expel me?
- For five years.

998
01:22:46,510 --> 01:22:48,144
You can appeal,

999
01:22:48,212 --> 01:22:50,029
but I don't think you're going to
be able to change Rosalie's mind.

1000
01:22:50,097 --> 01:22:53,116
I thought all this was legal
on the reservation.

1001
01:22:53,985 --> 01:22:55,284
Look, I got to go.

1002

BERNIE: If she leaves,
they'll turn you in.

1003
01:22:57,721 --> 01:22:59,939
The troopers
want somebody.

1004
01:23:00,007 --> 01:23:01,341
But she's a Mohawk.

1005
01:23:01,409 --> 01:23:02,959
BERNIE:
The chiefs want her out.

1006
01:23:03,027 --> 01:23:06,262
There's going to be nobody standing
between her and the troopers.

1007
01:23:08,916 --> 01:23:11,651
My kids got no one but me.

1008
01:23:11,719 --> 01:23:14,671
If you leave, she'll
never see her son again.

1009
01:23:14,739 --> 01:23:16,189
Let her go.

1010
01:23:17,475 --> 01:23:18,992
Lila, you're giving
up on him.

1011
01:23:19,060 --> 01:23:20,826
He's only a year old.

1012
01:23:26,100 --> 01:23:27,383
Just go.

1013
01:23:34,258 --> 01:23:37,810
At least you've got family
to take care of him, you know?

(PANTING)

1015
01:24:39,740 --> 01:24:44,361
I wanted the baby to have a pretty
new crib, not some hand-me-down.

1016
01:24:47,097 --> 01:24:49,232
He wouldn't let me go alone.

1017
01:24:53,103 --> 01:24:57,139
I was too fat to fit
behind the steering wheel.

1018

keep you and Little Jake safe.

01:25:08,268 --> 01:25:10,102
I got no record,
and I'm white.

1022

Get a good used singlewide.

Insulation is the key thing.

Versailles will
give you a hard time,

enough for you

Ricky's allergic
to penicillin,

1029
01:25:35,429 --> 01:25:39,299
and you can't feed him potato
chips all the time. Okay?

But you got
to get there quick,

will get scared.

to get scared. Okay?

Okay?
