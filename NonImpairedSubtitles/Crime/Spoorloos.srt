1
00:01:07,532 --> 00:01:10,296
- Rocklobster!
- Reindeer!

2
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:17,137
Animals with a "C".

3
00:01:17,675 --> 00:01:18,403
Crow!

4
00:01:18,709 --> 00:01:19,334
Crocodile!

5
00:01:19,877 --> 00:01:20,866
Chameleon!

6
00:01:21,846 --> 00:01:22,676
Cockroach!

7
00:01:25,817 --> 00:01:26,749
Crockrock!

8
00:01:37,562 --> 00:01:39,757
-Two "C"s. I'll start.
-I'll start!

9
00:01:47,705 --> 00:01:49,297
Let's get off the highway...

10
00:01:50,208 --> 00:01:53,769
see some local color.

11
00:01:54,745 --> 00:01:59,512
Only if you drive.

12
00:02:44,662 --> 00:02:45,458
What is it?

13
00:02:46,230 --> 00:02:48,425
I'm just looking at the gas meter.

14
00:02:48,533 --> 00:02:50,433
Just look in your mirror.

15
00:02:54,839 --> 00:02:59,299
If you sat behind the wheel,
you'd see the meter better.

16
00:03:02,246 --> 00:03:03,178
Look!

17
00:03:03,881 --> 00:03:05,314
There's one tree.

18
00:03:06,617 --> 00:03:07,709
A tree.

19
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:13,589
Unbelievable!
Another one tree.

20
00:03:20,498 --> 00:03:22,796
Peel an orange for me.

21
00:03:45,139 --> 00:03:47,539
Well, so much for your
"Iocal color."

22
00:03:54,248 --> 00:03:57,445
My nightmare.
I had it again last night.

23
00:03:57,952 --> 00:04:01,683
That you're inside a golden egg
and you can't get out,

24
00:04:02,256 --> 00:04:05,225
and you float all alone
through space forever.

25
00:04:06,794 --> 00:04:09,763
Yes, the loneliness is unbearable.

26
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:17,794
No. This time there was another
golden egg flying through space.

27
00:04:19,173 --> 00:04:25,476
And if we were to collide,
it'd all be over.

28
00:04:30,484 --> 00:04:31,917
Rex, what's that?

29
00:04:38,259 --> 00:04:40,625
- Gasoline.
- No, no, no!

30
00:04:41,095 --> 00:04:43,461
Take it easy.
I know it's my fault.

31
00:04:43,964 --> 00:04:45,829
This is really dangerous.

32
00:04:51,071 --> 00:04:53,665
- Calm down.
- Is the warning light on?

33
00:04:53,707 --> 00:04:56,437
There's no warning light in this car.

34
00:04:57,011 --> 00:05:00,105
See what happens when
you don't listen to me?

35
00:05:00,381 --> 00:05:02,406
Don't panic, dammit!

36
00:05:02,449 --> 00:05:06,044
What got us here doesn't matter.
We just have to get out.

37
00:05:06,086 --> 00:05:08,520
- And if you get hysterical...
- I'm not hysterical!

38
00:05:10,558 --> 00:05:11,820
I'm scared.

39
00:05:16,564 --> 00:05:18,122
The golden egg...

40
00:05:20,734 --> 00:05:23,259
This is no time to talk
about dreams.

41
00:05:23,737 --> 00:05:25,102
We have to get out of here.
C'mon!

42
00:05:25,372 --> 00:05:27,499
Nobody can see us.
We're gonna be run over.

43
00:05:27,541 --> 00:05:29,008
The flashlight! I brought one.

44
00:05:29,310 --> 00:05:31,835
- What flashlight?
- I packed one.

45
00:05:31,979 --> 00:05:34,777
Christ! A car's gonna plow
over us any minute!

46
00:05:34,915 --> 00:05:36,780
I have to find the flashlight.

47
00:05:36,917 --> 00:05:38,077
C'mon, godammit!

48
00:05:39,086 --> 00:05:40,917
Don't touch me! You go.

49
00:05:41,422 --> 00:05:44,084
Saskia, you won't find
the flashlight in this mess.

50
00:05:44,391 --> 00:05:45,221
I'm going.

51
00:05:46,627 --> 00:05:49,221
Rex wait! I'll find it!

52
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,934
Rex, don't leave me here alone!

53
00:06:07,615 --> 00:06:09,845
You can't leave me here alone!

54
00:06:19,660 --> 00:06:21,389
Rex, wait!

55
00:08:21,963 --> 00:08:23,362
That way.

56
00:09:23,691 --> 00:09:26,922
...one has only to be better
than his opponent...

57
00:09:28,396 --> 00:09:32,856
- Good day, sir. What'll it be?
- Fill it up, please. And this too.

58
00:09:50,785 --> 00:09:53,310
If you want, we can go back
to Amsterdam.

59
00:09:59,961 --> 00:10:02,122
I'm sorry about earlier.

60
00:10:03,631 --> 00:10:05,826
I didn't know what to do.

61
00:10:06,868 --> 00:10:09,462
Still, I shouldn't have left you alone.

62
00:10:12,140 --> 00:10:15,200
- I also have gas in the bidon.
- What?

63
00:10:16,377 --> 00:10:17,469
The jerry can.

64
00:10:22,116 --> 00:10:23,606
I love you.

65
00:10:27,054 --> 00:10:28,521
In the tunnel,

66
00:10:28,556 --> 00:10:31,582
when you called for me,
I felt I loved you more than ever.

67
00:10:31,626 --> 00:10:32,718
I hated you.

68
00:10:42,803 --> 00:10:44,964
We're going to have
a wonderful holiday,

69
00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:47,838
together in my little house.

70
00:10:48,142 --> 00:10:49,473
Well, what are we waiting for?

71
00:10:49,510 --> 00:10:51,375
I have to go to the ladies' room first.

72
00:10:51,412 --> 00:10:53,277
Okay, I'll wait for you over there.

73
00:10:57,351 --> 00:11:01,788
...and here comes the bunch
with Delgado, Bernaudeau...

74
00:11:01,923 --> 00:11:05,359
...and Hinault in front...

75
00:11:05,927 --> 00:11:08,589
Here you go. 300 francs, please.

76
00:11:11,666 --> 00:11:13,896
- Here.
- Thanks.

77
00:11:15,336 --> 00:11:16,462
Move on, please.

78
00:11:27,882 --> 00:11:29,509
Rex, catch!

79
00:11:35,890 --> 00:11:39,621
A frisbee for 1 3.50 francs?
What on earth for?

80
00:11:39,660 --> 00:11:44,063
You've been driving all this time.
It's good for stiffness.

81
00:11:47,735 --> 00:11:52,297
From the girl who loves roses.
Especially when they come in 8!

82
00:11:54,175 --> 00:11:57,201
- But I don't smoke.
- You can give me a light!

83
00:12:06,621 --> 00:12:07,747
What did I do?

84
00:12:15,529 --> 00:12:17,690
May I still go on vacation?

85
00:12:21,369 --> 00:12:22,961
Two conditions.

86
00:12:23,638 --> 00:12:24,969
And they are...?

87
00:12:26,107 --> 00:12:28,598
That I drive to Bois Vieux.

88
00:12:36,183 --> 00:12:40,381
You'd give a key ring this ugly
to a lovely lady like me?

89
00:12:40,421 --> 00:12:42,719
Yes, yes, yes.
And the second condition?

90
00:12:42,923 --> 00:12:43,981
Counting trees.

91
00:12:44,091 --> 00:12:46,116
5... 6... 7... 8...

92
00:12:46,260 --> 00:12:49,855
Fignon is climbing
in a very fluid style...

93
00:12:49,997 --> 00:12:52,795
Fignon, yes, Fignon is engaging
Herrera and Dietzen.

94
00:12:52,933 --> 00:12:56,096
He's flanking Hinault. Fignon's
climbing very smoothly...

95
00:12:56,237 --> 00:12:58,228
...and we're right there with him.

96
00:12:58,372 --> 00:13:00,840
Hinault's been left behind...

97
00:13:00,975 --> 00:13:03,876
Now he's paying for his repeated
attacks all the way up.

98
00:13:04,011 --> 00:13:06,809
Fignon... uh, Fignon... pardon...

99
00:13:06,947 --> 00:13:10,041
masters the situation
with supreme confidence...

100
00:13:10,184 --> 00:13:13,210
Hinault's gained distance...
I'm tripping over my words...

101
00:13:13,354 --> 00:13:14,981
he's leading... Fantastic!

102
00:13:15,122 --> 00:13:18,285
Hinault, Fignon, Herrera,
Dietzen... in the rear Millar.

103
00:13:18,426 --> 00:13:21,418
Hinault's suffering,
but his champion of Brittany

104
00:13:21,562 --> 00:13:23,996
has life in him yet.

105
00:13:24,131 --> 00:13:25,462
It's anybody's game.

106
00:13:25,599 --> 00:13:27,726
An important chapter
in the history of the Tour...

107
00:13:27,868 --> 00:13:29,836
is unfolding before our eyes.

108
00:13:30,971 --> 00:13:33,804
I, me, Rex Hofman

109
00:13:34,475 --> 00:13:36,204
I, Rex Hofman...

110
00:13:37,845 --> 00:13:41,178
swear that the wonderful...

111
00:13:42,883 --> 00:13:46,080
swear the wonderful...

112
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:48,147
exquisite and sweet...

113
00:13:48,889 --> 00:13:51,084
exquisite and...

114
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:54,757
almost always sweet...

115
00:13:55,062 --> 00:13:57,656
the always sweet Saskia Wagter...

116
00:13:58,232 --> 00:14:00,257
the always sweet Saskia Wagter...

117
00:14:01,502 --> 00:14:04,164
will never be abandoned by me.

118
00:14:05,806 --> 00:14:08,206
will never be abandoned by me.

119
00:14:24,325 --> 00:14:27,988
I'll keep them.
So I can get used to them.

120
00:14:30,030 --> 00:14:31,088
Stop exaggerating.

121
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:35,563
Let's grab something to drink,
then I'll drive to Bois Vieux.

122
00:14:35,836 --> 00:14:37,804
Want me to go and buy something?

123
00:14:37,838 --> 00:14:39,567
No, it's on me.

124
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:42,700
- Want a beer?
- Sounds good. Got any money?

125
00:14:48,382 --> 00:14:52,876
I'm exaggerating again.
Who on earth has to get used to car keys?

126
00:15:21,315 --> 00:15:24,580
- Have a good trip, you guys.
- Thanks. Same to you.

127
00:15:24,985 --> 00:15:25,781
Thanks.

128
00:15:33,727 --> 00:15:34,591
Bye.

129
00:16:25,198 --> 00:16:29,532
CAR GETTING USED TO SASKIA

130
00:16:41,781 --> 00:16:46,616
...Hinault's really suffering.
He's been passed by Herrera,

131
00:16:46,753 --> 00:16:50,120
who's finished this last
ascent in the lead,

132
00:16:50,256 --> 00:16:52,383
and by Fignon who's on his
way to winning

133
00:16:52,525 --> 00:16:54,584
the yellow jersey of the Tour,
1984...

134
00:16:54,728 --> 00:16:56,923
Fignon, who's just caught up
with Hinault...

135
00:16:57,063 --> 00:16:58,758
has now overtaken him
in the final stretch!

136
00:18:08,902 --> 00:18:16,172
SASKIA, I'M LOOKING FOR YOU.
WAIT IN THE CAR.

137
00:18:38,264 --> 00:18:39,754
- Saskia!
- Get out of the way!

138
00:18:40,567 --> 00:18:42,626
- I'm looking for my wife.
- You can't stand here.

139
00:18:57,116 --> 00:18:58,947
Sir, that's not the men's room.

140
00:19:05,758 --> 00:19:06,850
Saskia!

141
00:19:11,397 --> 00:19:14,366
- I can't find my wife.
- This isn't the ladies' room.

142
00:19:33,820 --> 00:19:36,550
Sir, customers aren't allowed here.

143
00:19:38,558 --> 00:19:40,890
Miss. Excuse me. Miss?

144
00:19:41,728 --> 00:19:42,752
I'm looking for my wife.

145
00:19:43,363 --> 00:19:45,661
She came to buy a beer
and a Coke.

146
00:19:46,332 --> 00:19:48,823
She's got reddish hair
with little...

147
00:19:51,170 --> 00:19:54,537
She's wearing white jeans
and a yellow jersey.

148
00:19:54,674 --> 00:19:56,107
Fignon has the yellow jersey.

149
00:19:57,510 --> 00:19:59,205
You mean a yellow top.

150
00:19:59,546 --> 00:20:01,104
Yeah, with gold thread.

151
00:20:01,381 --> 00:20:02,541
Wait, I've got a photo.

152
00:20:05,351 --> 00:20:07,319
Here you go.

153
00:20:08,888 --> 00:20:10,822
- Yeah, I've seen her.
- When?

154
00:20:10,857 --> 00:20:12,586
About... half an hour ago.

155
00:20:12,625 --> 00:20:14,593
She was by the coffee machine.

156
00:20:14,627 --> 00:20:17,289
The coffee machine? But...

157
00:20:17,330 --> 00:20:19,560
she wanted something cold.

158
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:24,297
She was by the coffee machine
and came over to get change.

159
00:20:24,370 --> 00:20:27,168
But was she alone
or talking to somebody?

160
00:20:27,206 --> 00:20:30,300
You know how many folks come
through here everyday? 1 0,000.

161
00:20:30,343 --> 00:20:32,368
And they're all strangers.

162
00:20:32,412 --> 00:20:35,040
Excuse me,
have you seen this woman?

163
00:20:37,250 --> 00:20:41,277
Yes, I saw her leaving
with a man a few minutes ago.

164
00:20:42,422 --> 00:20:45,687
- Minutes?
- About 1 5 minutes ago.

165
00:20:45,725 --> 00:20:48,853
Your girl was leaving the shop
with a drink in each hand.

166
00:20:49,228 --> 00:20:50,320
A Coke and a beer.

167
00:20:52,198 --> 00:20:53,563
Was she alone or with someone?

168
00:20:54,334 --> 00:20:56,063
All alone... I think... I dunno.

169
00:20:58,338 --> 00:21:02,035
- And then?
- Then I did an oil change...

170
00:21:02,175 --> 00:21:04,643
But where'd you see her last?

171
00:21:05,545 --> 00:21:07,775
At that door, over there.

172
00:21:14,020 --> 00:21:18,013
If she was here with the cans,
then she was on her way back.

173
00:21:18,558 --> 00:21:19,991
So, she must have seen me.

174
00:21:21,961 --> 00:21:24,395
Which means I could also see her.

175
00:21:25,098 --> 00:21:26,065
The Polaroid!

176
00:21:27,734 --> 00:21:30,134
Look! Here she is.

177
00:21:33,406 --> 00:21:34,737
Here, the little red dot.

178
00:21:35,141 --> 00:21:39,635
See? It's her.
It can't be anyone else.

179
00:21:40,013 --> 00:21:43,710
And there's somebody here,
beside her.

180
00:21:44,017 --> 00:21:45,109
We've got to find him.

181
00:21:45,952 --> 00:21:47,749
A cyclist isn't just a pair of legs...

182
00:21:47,887 --> 00:21:49,946
He's got a head...
You've gotta be able to think...

183
00:21:50,089 --> 00:21:51,181
The bikes!

184
00:21:51,591 --> 00:21:54,321
Yes, this Jean-Paul Brouchon says:
It's a duel between 2 men...

185
00:22:23,149 --> 00:22:24,138
Dad!

186
00:22:35,662 --> 00:22:39,223
We're tempted to say, at the end
of this 17th day of the Tour...

187
00:22:39,366 --> 00:22:43,894
Mr. Hofman, believe me,
I'm taking you seriously.

188
00:22:46,406 --> 00:22:49,204
You know very well that
you didn't fight with your wife,

189
00:22:49,242 --> 00:22:51,870
but how do you expect
the police to know that?

190
00:22:52,445 --> 00:22:54,276
She's disappeared, right?

191
00:22:54,748 --> 00:22:56,716
Your wife's only been gone
a few hours.

192
00:22:57,050 --> 00:22:59,314
To them, it's just
a domestic quarrel.

193
00:22:59,953 --> 00:23:03,821
Imagine if they had to investigate
every time...

194
00:23:03,957 --> 00:23:06,016
If she's not back by 8:00 a.m.
tomorrow,

195
00:23:06,159 --> 00:23:08,127
you can get them to open a case.

196
00:23:08,161 --> 00:23:09,685
Tomorrow morning's too late.

197
00:23:10,330 --> 00:23:12,764
We have to do something now!

198
00:23:13,199 --> 00:23:15,667
She might have been kidnapped.

199
00:23:16,503 --> 00:23:18,801
He must've left a clue somewhere.

200
00:23:19,305 --> 00:23:20,329
Listen, in the morning I'll...

201
00:23:20,473 --> 00:23:24,500
You listen! We don't have to wait
for the police.

202
00:23:25,812 --> 00:23:29,839
She was by the coffee machine,
she was talking to someone.

203
00:23:31,551 --> 00:23:34,611
If he got coffee,

204
00:23:35,355 --> 00:23:37,880
he must have left his prints
on a coin.

205
00:23:38,858 --> 00:23:42,589
We have to keep an eye on all that
change 'til the police get here.

206
00:23:49,636 --> 00:23:50,762
You can't be serious!

207
00:23:52,405 --> 00:23:53,372
That's absurd.

208
00:23:54,641 --> 00:23:56,939
- Tomorrow morning...
- Sir...

209
00:25:09,282 --> 00:25:12,979
HOUSE FOR SALE

210
00:25:36,142 --> 00:25:38,667
Careful! That doesn't look
very steady.

211
00:25:51,824 --> 00:25:53,724
I'm not surprised,
this is an old dump.

212
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:56,888
Denise, you're unbelievable!
lf your grandma heard you...

213
00:26:04,437 --> 00:26:08,203
As a reward for your patience with me,
look what I've brought.

214
00:26:08,641 --> 00:26:12,372
Ah... Gaby, get the corkscrew
from the drawer, please.

215
00:26:19,085 --> 00:26:19,983
Spiders!

216
00:26:20,853 --> 00:26:22,821
Such adorable, lovable animals.
And so useful too.

217
00:26:23,156 --> 00:26:25,283
That was a really beautiful scream!
Let's hear it again.

218
00:26:25,491 --> 00:26:26,389
I can do it louder.

219
00:26:39,272 --> 00:26:40,204
And mommy?

220
00:26:52,018 --> 00:26:54,452
How's the house coming along?

221
00:26:55,455 --> 00:26:56,479
We're doing our best.

222
00:26:56,623 --> 00:26:59,922
Why don't you cut more trees down?
You'll get more sunlight.

223
00:27:00,059 --> 00:27:01,583
And thieves too.

224
00:27:02,028 --> 00:27:04,929
When one has a beautiful house,
it's never for oneself alone.

225
00:27:05,331 --> 00:27:08,858
Tell me, Mr. Laurent, I was here
yesterday with my wife and kids...

226
00:27:09,068 --> 00:27:11,298
- I'm not sure if you noticed...?
- No.

227
00:27:11,537 --> 00:27:14,005
Because as we drove up,
we thought we heard screams

228
00:27:14,140 --> 00:27:15,300
coming from my place.

229
00:27:16,075 --> 00:27:19,602
- Did you hear anything?
- No, not a thing.

230
00:27:45,438 --> 00:27:47,531
- You going to Nîmes?
- Yes.

231
00:27:47,674 --> 00:27:48,663
Louis!

232
00:27:49,342 --> 00:27:50,468
I'm with a friend.

233
00:27:52,111 --> 00:27:53,009
Yes, I see.

234
00:27:53,613 --> 00:27:55,979
Listen, you're scam artists.
I'm not.

235
00:27:56,015 --> 00:27:58,711
There's space for two,
but I stopped for her and her alone.

236
00:27:59,352 --> 00:28:00,785
So, see ya!

237
00:29:50,096 --> 00:29:51,427
I'll do it in the blink of an eye.

238
00:29:57,603 --> 00:29:58,570
Let's see...

239
00:29:58,704 --> 00:30:02,299
12cc is equal to...

240
00:30:04,277 --> 00:30:05,437
How much do I have...?

241
00:30:07,747 --> 00:30:12,207
Yes, 18 minutes, 54 seconds.

242
00:30:14,487 --> 00:30:16,580
18 minutes, 54 seconds
is equal to...

243
00:30:18,507 --> 00:30:20,805
17 miles, more or less.

244
00:30:22,511 --> 00:30:27,972
That leaves me a margin
of 3 or 4 minutes.

245
00:30:28,483 --> 00:30:29,711
That's not bad.

246
00:30:33,088 --> 00:30:34,214
Not bad.

247
00:31:13,161 --> 00:31:14,025
Good day, madam.

248
00:31:16,965 --> 00:31:21,527
What a coincidence!

249
00:31:22,437 --> 00:31:24,132
You may as well get in my car.

250
00:31:34,483 --> 00:31:36,280
Handkerchief...

251
00:31:44,025 --> 00:31:45,390
It's a little small...

252
00:31:48,897 --> 00:31:51,991
Madam. Yes, like this.

253
00:31:59,608 --> 00:32:01,769
Well. I'll start over.

254
00:32:11,319 --> 00:32:12,411
What a coincidence!

255
00:32:13,455 --> 00:32:15,047
You may as well get in my car.

256
00:32:16,124 --> 00:32:17,091
Good.

257
00:32:21,496 --> 00:32:22,520
There!

258
00:32:30,038 --> 00:32:31,062
And here!

259
00:32:37,345 --> 00:32:38,505
Excuse me.

260
00:33:40,308 --> 00:33:41,900
Why'd you do that?

261
00:33:42,210 --> 00:33:44,371
Because I love you. See?

262
00:33:44,412 --> 00:33:46,346
No, I mean the lock.

263
00:33:47,582 --> 00:33:49,447
Didn't you read about
that girl in the paper?

264
00:33:49,484 --> 00:33:51,884
She fell out of a car
on the highway recently.

265
00:33:52,454 --> 00:33:54,251
That's terrible! ls she dead?

266
00:33:54,689 --> 00:33:56,020
Come now, think about it.

267
00:33:56,057 --> 00:33:59,584
The tar, cars traveling
at high speeds...

268
00:33:59,628 --> 00:34:01,152
Of course she's dead.

269
00:34:06,434 --> 00:34:08,527
Daddy, do you have a mistress?

270
00:34:09,804 --> 00:34:11,203
Don't be so shocked.

271
00:34:11,239 --> 00:34:13,230
At your age you're allowed to, right?

272
00:34:14,342 --> 00:34:17,277
At the house at St. Côme.
I'm not dumb.

273
00:34:39,701 --> 00:34:43,102
Excuse me.
The Prisunic drug store...?

274
00:34:43,271 --> 00:34:46,331
The Prisunic? What a coincidence,
I'm heading there myself.

275
00:34:46,374 --> 00:34:47,636
I can take you;

276
00:34:49,944 --> 00:34:51,673
make the best of your luck!

277
00:34:52,847 --> 00:34:54,838
Yes, but...
I think I'd rather walk.

278
00:34:56,384 --> 00:34:58,875
You're right.
It's a beautiful day.

279
00:34:59,821 --> 00:35:01,789
So... the Prisunic...
go down the avenue,

280
00:35:02,057 --> 00:35:04,651
and to your right.
It's in front of the square.

281
00:35:23,144 --> 00:35:25,237
3:42 p.m.

282
00:35:26,848 --> 00:35:28,782
Pulse rate: 90.

283
00:35:30,552 --> 00:35:32,782
The euphoria of victory
in this royal display...

284
00:35:32,921 --> 00:35:37,915
Zoetemelk at 76 and 79,
Kuilper at 77 and 78,

285
00:35:38,059 --> 00:35:42,496
Winnen at 81 and 83 to carry on
the Dutch tradition.

286
00:36:03,918 --> 00:36:07,615
- Is there someone else?
- No.

287
00:36:15,096 --> 00:36:17,894
WILL FIGNON SCORE THE YELLOW?

288
00:36:20,435 --> 00:36:22,835
Don't you want to know
why I asked?

289
00:36:26,574 --> 00:36:31,011
If it wasn't me who was going there,
I'd see it the same way.

290
00:36:31,045 --> 00:36:34,708
All the time I seem to spend at St. Côme,
all the mileage I do...

291
00:36:34,749 --> 00:36:36,410
But Simone, I love you.

292
00:36:37,418 --> 00:36:39,215
And I love our two daughters.

293
00:36:42,157 --> 00:36:46,992
And without a doubt,
I'm the last Frenchman who can be proud

294
00:36:47,128 --> 00:36:50,427
of having known
only one woman in his life.

295
00:36:59,941 --> 00:37:01,806
It's the mileage.

296
00:37:02,143 --> 00:37:06,944
It's 8 miles from here to the house.
1 6 roundtrip.

297
00:37:06,981 --> 00:37:11,247
Lately, you've been averaging
31 miles a day.

298
00:37:11,653 --> 00:37:14,520
I used to dream of having
a wife who loved numbers.

299
00:37:14,556 --> 00:37:16,183
Well, here she is.

300
00:37:16,391 --> 00:37:17,358
Denise.

301
00:37:17,992 --> 00:37:20,051
Denise. Go to your room.

302
00:37:22,764 --> 00:37:25,528
The house at St. Côme
is like a passion.

303
00:37:29,737 --> 00:37:33,070
Because it's perfect,
it has become a passion.

304
00:37:33,708 --> 00:37:35,835
You start with an idea
in your head.

305
00:37:37,412 --> 00:37:41,007
And you take a step...
then a second...

306
00:37:42,617 --> 00:37:46,553
Soon, you realize you're up to
your neck in something intense,

307
00:37:48,056 --> 00:37:49,683
but that doesn't matter.

308
00:37:50,425 --> 00:37:53,917
You keep at it for the sheer
pleasure of it.

309
00:37:54,162 --> 00:37:56,995
For the pure satisfaction
it might bring you.

310
00:38:00,869 --> 00:38:04,066
And that, my dear...
that can't be measured in miles.

311
00:38:06,641 --> 00:38:11,305
Today, the 140 survivors of the
Tour enter their final week...

312
00:38:11,512 --> 00:38:13,844
Excuse me, madam,
I'm looking for the Prisunic...?

313
00:38:13,882 --> 00:38:15,247
You going by car?

314
00:38:16,050 --> 00:38:19,042
Aren't you Mr. Lemorne
from Nîmes?

315
00:38:20,588 --> 00:38:22,385
Don't you recognize me?

316
00:38:23,024 --> 00:38:24,821
Gisèle Marzin.

317
00:38:25,493 --> 00:38:29,395
I know your daughter Gabrielle very well.
I was her volleyball coach.

318
00:38:29,564 --> 00:38:30,826
Oh, yes... of course.

319
00:38:31,165 --> 00:38:33,292
We often met at the games.

320
00:38:33,334 --> 00:38:35,632
Do you come to Remoulins a lot?

321
00:38:36,237 --> 00:38:37,821
I'm sorry, I'm in a hurry.

322
00:38:37,821 --> 00:38:38,116
I'm sorry, I'm in a hurry.

323
00:38:38,822 --> 00:38:41,586
We could have a quick coffee.
Just for 5 minutes.

324
00:38:41,625 --> 00:38:43,490
No, I really am in a rush.

325
00:38:44,161 --> 00:38:45,924
Mr. Lemorne...

326
00:38:45,963 --> 00:38:47,521
the Prisunic...

327
00:38:47,831 --> 00:38:51,824
Take the highway in any direction.
I was just there. It's full of foreigners.

328
00:38:51,869 --> 00:38:57,068
Stop at any gas station,
you'll find hundreds of women,

329
00:38:57,207 --> 00:38:59,835
and there's no danger
of being recognized.

330
00:39:01,345 --> 00:39:03,813
It's Laurent Fignon in the lead.

331
00:39:03,947 --> 00:39:06,211
He's become the favorite...

332
00:39:50,961 --> 00:39:53,259
very demanding... the best, surely.

333
00:39:53,730 --> 00:39:56,756
The Fignon/Hinault duel is
getting more intense...

334
00:39:56,900 --> 00:40:00,301
...in fact, on this day, it's
not a question of finesse...

335
00:40:25,696 --> 00:40:27,061
She's never there.

336
00:40:27,497 --> 00:40:30,125
I'll see her mother next week.

337
00:40:30,267 --> 00:40:33,725
THIS YOUNG WOMAN DISAPPEARED
3 YEARS AGO

338
00:40:51,421 --> 00:40:53,412
That guy and his posters again.

339
00:40:53,457 --> 00:40:54,583
What guy?

340
00:40:55,425 --> 00:40:58,155
Try to remember.
We've already argued about this.

341
00:40:58,195 --> 00:40:59,457
We argue about everything...

342
00:40:59,496 --> 00:41:03,227
At Martinez's, you wanted to crucify
anyone who kidnapped young girls.

343
00:41:03,266 --> 00:41:05,461
I even asked, "What if I'd done it?"
You laughed in my face!

344
00:41:05,502 --> 00:41:07,026
Ah yes, the Dutch girl.
And so?

345
00:41:07,070 --> 00:41:10,597
Nothing. I admire his perseverance.

346
00:41:11,742 --> 00:41:14,302
You mean his obsession. 3 years...

347
00:41:14,678 --> 00:41:17,670
Exactly. I don't get it.
He's some guy.

348
00:41:53,517 --> 00:41:54,609
Good glue, isn't it?

349
00:41:55,719 --> 00:41:57,152
Yeah, it's a good glue.

350
00:42:01,324 --> 00:42:03,849
Sometimes I imagine she's alive.

351
00:42:05,195 --> 00:42:07,993
Somewhere far away.
She's very happy.

352
00:42:09,633 --> 00:42:11,760
And then, I have to make a choice.

353
00:42:12,803 --> 00:42:18,298
Either I let her go on living
and never know,

354
00:42:19,476 --> 00:42:23,776
or I let her die and
find out what happened.

355
00:42:28,051 --> 00:42:30,042
So... I let her die.

356
00:42:31,288 --> 00:42:34,348
I don't feel like being
part of a ménage à trois.

357
00:42:44,034 --> 00:42:44,932
Sir?

358
00:42:46,036 --> 00:42:47,867
Good morning, sir.
A Perrier, please.

359
00:42:48,004 --> 00:42:49,369
A Perrier, sure.

360
00:42:49,406 --> 00:42:51,033
Excuse me, sir.

361
00:42:51,608 --> 00:42:55,635
- You know a Montmejean?
- Yeah: me.

362
00:42:56,480 --> 00:42:59,074
- What?
- I'm Mr. Montmejean.

363
00:43:02,152 --> 00:43:05,087
- Ah, all right... Thank you.
- A Perrier.

364
00:43:05,222 --> 00:43:08,020
I want to see you.
September 13th. 3:00 p.m.

365
00:43:08,058 --> 00:43:10,026
Café Des Beaux Arts, Nîmes.

366
00:43:10,393 --> 00:43:11,451
Montmejean.

367
00:44:17,494 --> 00:44:20,019
He's watching me. I can feel it.

368
00:44:23,066 --> 00:44:24,727
I think he's a lunatic.

369
00:44:25,001 --> 00:44:29,267
If he's really involved,
he wouldn't put himself in such danger.

370
00:44:31,675 --> 00:44:34,838
This is the fifth time
he's made me run after him,

371
00:44:35,512 --> 00:44:39,039
and it's always within 62 miles
of that gas station.

372
00:44:41,318 --> 00:44:43,081
He's building up courage.

373
00:44:45,021 --> 00:44:49,117
He knows I could've seen him then,
and that I might recognize him now.

374
00:44:49,859 --> 00:44:50,723
And then?

375
00:44:56,800 --> 00:44:57,767
No idea.

376
00:45:01,238 --> 00:45:03,172
Know what I'm afraid of?

377
00:45:04,374 --> 00:45:07,309
That he'll stop sending postcards.

378
00:45:09,212 --> 00:45:10,679
What if he's dead?

379
00:45:11,348 --> 00:45:13,407
Then I'll never know.

380
00:45:21,391 --> 00:45:22,949
You won't ever know.

381
00:45:23,960 --> 00:45:27,794
He's playing with you.
He's followed the story through the papers,

382
00:45:27,931 --> 00:45:30,525
and wants to see how far you'll go.

383
00:45:32,035 --> 00:45:35,061
He just needs to send a postcard
and you obey him.

384
00:45:36,573 --> 00:45:38,165
He's having a blast.

385
00:45:40,043 --> 00:45:40,941
We'll see.

386
00:45:58,328 --> 00:45:59,727
Quarter to four.

387
00:46:03,066 --> 00:46:04,533
Shall we go?

388
00:46:06,202 --> 00:46:07,794
Let him go to hell.

389
00:46:07,837 --> 00:46:12,900
- He's here. Saskia was...
- Saskia's gone, Rex. She's gone.

390
00:46:13,009 --> 00:46:17,469
Show this nutcase, or whatever he is,
that you're not interested anymore.

391
00:46:17,647 --> 00:46:19,979
And if you want to do something
meaningful in your life,

392
00:46:20,016 --> 00:46:23,008
come lie with me in the sun.
And do nothing.

393
00:46:29,209 --> 00:46:32,940
If Saskia were here now,
I'd still go with you.

394
00:46:33,514 --> 00:46:35,641
But if it were possible
to really choose,

395
00:46:35,683 --> 00:46:39,380
I'd rather be at that gas station...
3 years ago.

396
00:47:11,618 --> 00:47:12,550
Lieneke!

397
00:47:45,119 --> 00:47:46,586
Where do you want to go?

398
00:47:48,455 --> 00:47:50,821
To Anduze, Bois Vieux.

399
00:47:53,093 --> 00:47:55,425
I've never been there.

400
00:47:55,496 --> 00:47:57,293
Then it's time you went.

401
00:47:59,900 --> 00:48:02,767
I've had enough of your
"sacred places."

402
00:48:31,498 --> 00:48:33,796
There might be people up there.

403
00:49:37,064 --> 00:49:41,433
Crocodile... chameleon...
caterpillar...

404
00:49:42,035 --> 00:49:42,967
Here we are.

405
00:51:12,492 --> 00:51:17,429
Golden egg... golden egg...

406
00:51:20,567 --> 00:51:22,034
What egg?

407
00:51:28,909 --> 00:51:31,605
Saskia! Saskia!

408
00:52:13,754 --> 00:52:17,087
Come on! Come on!

409
00:52:19,426 --> 00:52:20,393
Here I am!

410
00:52:21,328 --> 00:52:22,454
Rex Hofman!

411
00:52:23,096 --> 00:52:25,496
Come on!

412
00:52:27,100 --> 00:52:28,761
Come and show yourself.

413
00:52:30,170 --> 00:52:31,569
Hey, piss off, man!

414
00:52:32,406 --> 00:52:34,374
Come and show yourself!

415
00:52:34,908 --> 00:52:36,808
What's all this crap about?

416
00:52:38,345 --> 00:52:39,778
You finished, you prick?

417
00:52:40,080 --> 00:52:41,775
Yes! I'm here, Rex Hofman!

418
00:52:42,749 --> 00:52:45,616
Don't you get it?
Do I have to come down there?

419
00:52:45,986 --> 00:52:48,136
Come and show yourself!

420
00:52:48,803 --> 00:52:51,795
Last equation: benzoic acid...

421
00:52:54,575 --> 00:52:56,566
plus NH2...

422
00:53:00,548 --> 00:53:01,606
H20...

423
00:53:03,584 --> 00:53:04,846
30 seconds.

424
00:53:11,225 --> 00:53:12,658
Mr. Lemorne.

425
00:53:15,730 --> 00:53:16,560
1 5.

426
00:53:24,372 --> 00:53:25,771
Mr. Lemorne.

427
00:53:26,574 --> 00:53:27,563
5.

428
00:53:32,180 --> 00:53:33,704
Finish.

429
00:53:36,984 --> 00:53:40,818
- Where are you standing?
- Next to the fountain.

430
00:53:42,590 --> 00:53:48,426
In this crowded square in Arles,
there might be a murderer.

431
00:53:48,963 --> 00:53:51,431
You might see him,
but you won't realize it.

432
00:53:51,465 --> 00:53:53,990
He's just another face
in the crowd.

433
00:53:54,535 --> 00:53:59,234
A gripping situation
which Mr. Hofman

434
00:53:59,373 --> 00:54:01,364
has experienced 5 times.

435
00:54:01,409 --> 00:54:03,070
Daddy, look! There we are!

436
00:54:03,277 --> 00:54:07,077
-How many times did the police videotape it?
-Didn't you see?

437
00:54:07,215 --> 00:54:08,648
Only the first 2 times.

438
00:54:09,851 --> 00:54:13,912
Now they're convinced
it's just a bad joke.

439
00:54:14,555 --> 00:54:16,352
And you don't agree, right?

440
00:54:17,892 --> 00:54:21,453
No. And I hope this gentleman
is listening.

441
00:54:22,496 --> 00:54:24,987
There's something
I want to tell him.

442
00:54:26,567 --> 00:54:28,535
I want to meet you.

443
00:54:29,770 --> 00:54:32,796
I want to know what happened
to my friend.

444
00:54:33,741 --> 00:54:36,938
To know that,
I'm prepared to do anything.

445
00:54:38,279 --> 00:54:39,644
I don't hate you.

446
00:54:40,314 --> 00:54:43,147
I don't hate anything.
But I need to know.

447
00:54:45,019 --> 00:54:46,486
I need to know.

448
00:56:05,333 --> 00:56:06,163
I'm sorry.

449
00:56:11,205 --> 00:56:13,366
I hope you'll eventually
learn something.

450
00:56:19,747 --> 00:56:22,181
She's working in a brothel
in Marseilles.

451
00:56:29,690 --> 00:56:35,390
I'll see her in 3 days.
Mrs. Phoenix, Montelimar.

452
00:57:00,588 --> 00:57:04,115
- Take a look?
- Okay.

453
00:57:25,679 --> 00:57:31,709
In this crowded square in Arles,
there might be a murderer.

454
00:57:32,053 --> 00:57:34,146
You might see him,
but you won't realize it.

455
00:57:34,622 --> 00:57:37,250
He's just another face
in the crowd.

456
00:57:37,691 --> 00:57:41,991
A gripping situation
which Mr. Hofman

457
00:57:42,129 --> 00:57:44,029
has experienced 5 times.

458
00:57:49,437 --> 00:57:50,961
I need to know.

459
00:57:52,440 --> 00:57:55,967
Do you have any idea what
kind of person he could be?

460
00:57:57,511 --> 00:57:58,535
I think...

461
00:57:59,814 --> 00:58:02,544
no, I'm sure... he's...

462
00:58:03,551 --> 00:58:05,951
he's very intelligent,

463
00:58:06,253 --> 00:58:08,721
can go unnoticed,

464
00:58:10,024 --> 00:58:12,515
and is a total perfectionist.

465
00:58:13,227 --> 00:58:16,025
Mr. Hofman, an important question:

466
00:58:17,832 --> 00:58:22,462
this new campaign must cost
at least 100,000 guilders.

467
00:58:23,070 --> 00:58:27,439
That means you've had to borrow
about 300,000 francs.

468
00:58:27,842 --> 00:58:30,743
Why now? After 3 years?

469
00:58:31,312 --> 00:58:34,713
Not long ago, I had a dream.

470
00:58:34,915 --> 00:58:41,252
The exact same dream my friend had
the night before she disappeared.

471
00:58:42,957 --> 00:58:44,481
She dreamed

472
00:58:45,726 --> 00:58:50,993
that we'd meet somewhere in space,

473
00:58:51,665 --> 00:58:53,223
each of us

474
00:58:53,267 --> 00:58:55,497
imprisoned inside a golden egg.

475
00:58:57,872 --> 00:59:03,742
In my dream we also found each other,
out there in space.

476
00:59:06,113 --> 00:59:09,082
And I've interpreted this dream
as a sign.

477
00:59:09,950 --> 00:59:11,884
Do you have any hope...

478
00:59:12,386 --> 00:59:15,014
Of finding her? No!

479
00:59:16,123 --> 00:59:18,956
Then, Mr. Hofman, why
don't you give up?

480
00:59:20,728 --> 00:59:22,992
It's an homage, sir.

481
00:59:24,798 --> 00:59:25,856
Nice.

482
00:59:26,367 --> 00:59:30,428
An homage to the vanished loved one.

483
00:59:30,471 --> 00:59:33,599
If you have any information
about this young woman,

484
00:59:33,974 --> 00:59:35,635
please contact us.

485
00:59:36,210 --> 00:59:37,973
Thank you, Mr. Hofman.

486
00:59:52,280 --> 00:59:54,111
You're quite photogenic.

487
01:00:06,360 --> 01:00:07,156
I'm sorry.

488
01:00:09,597 --> 01:00:11,155
How are you?

489
01:00:12,233 --> 01:00:13,825
Okay.

490
01:00:14,368 --> 01:00:15,767
Really?

491
01:00:20,541 --> 01:00:22,907
Don't you know "Lieneke's Law"?

492
01:00:23,511 --> 01:00:26,139
Relationship Law #1 :

493
01:00:29,483 --> 01:00:34,580
"Getting over the separation lasts
half the time the relationship did."

494
01:00:34,622 --> 01:00:37,750
So I'll be over it in about 4 months.

495
01:00:44,265 --> 01:00:45,823
It's a pity.

496
01:00:47,835 --> 01:00:50,201
If there'd been no Saskia...

497
01:00:50,471 --> 01:00:54,635
True, if there'd been no Saskia.
But there was and is a Saskia.

498
01:00:55,743 --> 01:00:57,370
Understand that.

499
01:01:08,022 --> 01:01:09,614
I'll call you.

500
01:02:57,665 --> 01:02:59,155
Mr. Hofman.

501
01:03:01,402 --> 01:03:03,336
I'm the man you're looking for.

502
01:03:07,308 --> 01:03:09,572
Café des Beaux Arts, in Nîmes.

503
01:03:09,710 --> 01:03:13,237
I saw you, but you weren't alone,
so I didn't dare bother you.

504
01:03:17,752 --> 01:03:19,913
Is she de... dead?

505
01:03:20,187 --> 01:03:22,417
Come with me to France
and you'll know everything.

506
01:03:22,456 --> 01:03:26,893
- Even how she died?
- I offer you this unique chance.

507
01:04:00,661 --> 01:04:01,491
Finished?

508
01:04:12,740 --> 01:04:15,004
I'm warning you,
I've taken precautions.

509
01:04:16,377 --> 01:04:19,141
If anything happens to me,
if you speak to anyone,

510
01:04:19,280 --> 01:04:22,340
my offer's no longer valid.
And you won't know a thing!

511
01:04:22,383 --> 01:04:24,681
I'm going back to France
with or without you.

512
01:04:24,718 --> 01:04:26,686
I'm off in 5 minutes.

513
01:04:57,485 --> 01:05:00,477
All this time,
I was afraid you might be dead.

514
01:05:34,255 --> 01:05:36,485
If you're hungry,
I've prepared everything.

515
01:05:53,874 --> 01:05:56,069
Passport. Passport.

516
01:06:05,686 --> 01:06:09,122
If they don't stop us,
I promise I'll tell you everything.

517
01:06:32,079 --> 01:06:33,046
Go on.

518
01:06:43,190 --> 01:06:44,817
Lemorne, Raymond.

519
01:06:45,392 --> 01:06:47,257
6 Place aux Herbes, Nîmes.

520
01:06:48,862 --> 01:06:53,196
Last time you made me go to your place.

521
01:06:58,038 --> 01:07:01,166
True, I don't like the idea
that you know my name.

522
01:07:01,208 --> 01:07:03,369
I have to limit my risks.

523
01:07:03,444 --> 01:07:06,504
But you could have traced it
from my license plate.

524
01:07:08,782 --> 01:07:10,943
You won't gain anything by
opening an investigation.

525
01:07:10,985 --> 01:07:13,044
You have nothing on me.

526
01:07:13,520 --> 01:07:18,457
The coins in the coffee machine.
Your prints are on them.

527
01:07:19,593 --> 01:07:22,790
If I'd been thirsty, and if I had coffee,

528
01:07:22,830 --> 01:07:25,526
I'd have held the coins by the edge.

529
01:07:27,401 --> 01:07:32,771
You're on a Polaroid I took
at the gas station!

530
01:07:33,140 --> 01:07:34,266
That's a lie.

531
01:07:34,308 --> 01:07:37,709
You would have recognized me at
the café in Nîmes. I was there.

532
01:07:41,248 --> 01:07:43,512
Second table on the right.

533
01:07:47,855 --> 01:07:48,822
Passport.

534
01:08:05,186 --> 01:08:08,622
I've thought a lot about
our meeting, Mr. Hofman.

535
01:08:08,689 --> 01:08:11,715
Since the beginning,
I felt the need to see you.

536
01:08:11,826 --> 01:08:14,090
When you left the café,

537
01:08:14,128 --> 01:08:16,221
I realized I couldn't wait any longer.

538
01:08:17,732 --> 01:08:20,223
What you said on television pursuaded me.

539
01:08:20,268 --> 01:08:22,998
I gathered the courage you spoke of.

540
01:08:25,273 --> 01:08:27,207
You can kill me.

541
01:08:28,409 --> 01:08:30,502
I acknowledge your right to do so.

542
01:08:30,544 --> 01:08:31,909
I'll take the risk.

543
01:08:33,881 --> 01:08:36,873
But I'm banking on your curiosity.

544
01:08:37,652 --> 01:08:40,815
You want to know what
happened to Miss Saskia.

545
01:08:58,839 --> 01:09:01,535
When I was 1 6,
I discovered something.

546
01:10:05,706 --> 01:10:08,573
Everyone has those thoughts,
but no one ever jumps.

547
01:10:10,144 --> 01:10:12,874
I told myself:
"Imagine you're jumping."

548
01:10:14,281 --> 01:10:16,806
Is it predestined that I won't jump?

549
01:10:17,651 --> 01:10:19,983
How can it be predestined
that I won't?

550
01:10:21,222 --> 01:10:23,747
So, to go against what is
predestined, one must jump.

551
01:10:23,891 --> 01:10:24,880
I jumped.

552
01:10:27,695 --> 01:10:29,162
The fall was a holy event.

553
01:10:29,196 --> 01:10:33,326
I broke my left arm and lost 2 fingers.
Why did I jump?

554
01:10:33,467 --> 01:10:35,799
A slight abnormality in my personality,

555
01:10:36,170 --> 01:10:38,365
imperceptible to those around me.

556
01:10:38,472 --> 01:10:41,498
You can find me listed
in the medical encyclopedias

557
01:10:41,542 --> 01:10:44,534
under "Sociopath" in the new editions.

558
01:10:44,578 --> 01:10:46,546
Did you rape Saskia?

559
01:10:47,381 --> 01:10:48,473
Come now, Mr. Hofman!

560
01:10:51,719 --> 01:10:55,416
It was 26 years before a new
experience came to mind.

561
01:10:55,656 --> 01:10:56,816
First place!

562
01:10:58,492 --> 01:11:00,426
Denise! I thought so.

563
01:11:00,528 --> 01:11:02,621
A bit to the left. There.

564
01:11:03,264 --> 01:11:04,595
To the left.

565
01:11:04,632 --> 01:11:06,361
Leave a space between you and mom...

566
01:11:06,400 --> 01:11:08,595
Good. Keep still.

567
01:11:13,574 --> 01:11:16,270
Smile! Or no pocket money.

568
01:11:21,816 --> 01:11:22,578
Stay there.

569
01:11:23,918 --> 01:11:26,443
Dad, there's a little girl
in the water!

570
01:12:13,701 --> 01:12:15,328
Bidule drowned!

571
01:12:16,437 --> 01:12:17,734
Who's Bidule?

572
01:12:18,072 --> 01:12:19,733
My dolly.

573
01:12:20,407 --> 01:12:23,433
The man won't save her.

574
01:12:28,916 --> 01:12:31,146
- Goodbye.
- Thank you very much.

575
01:12:38,626 --> 01:12:42,255
Dad, you're a hero!
Jumping in without a second thought!

576
01:12:42,396 --> 01:12:44,557
Of course! I'm a hero.

577
01:12:45,933 --> 01:12:47,594
But never trust a hero.

578
01:12:47,635 --> 01:12:51,036
A hero is capable of rash gestures.

579
01:12:51,839 --> 01:12:55,275
My daughter was bursting
with pride.

580
01:12:56,176 --> 01:13:00,909
But I thought that her admiration
wasn't worth anything...

581
01:13:01,715 --> 01:13:05,378
unless I could prove myself
absolutely incapable

582
01:13:05,986 --> 01:13:08,011
of doing anything evil.

583
01:13:08,055 --> 01:13:10,387
And as black cannot exist
without white,

584
01:13:10,424 --> 01:13:13,416
I logically conceived
the most horrible deed

585
01:13:13,460 --> 01:13:15,928
that I could envision
right at that moment.

586
01:13:16,630 --> 01:13:20,225
But I want you to know,
for me killing is not the worst thing.

587
01:13:25,639 --> 01:13:28,039
Could we stretch our legs?

588
01:14:05,946 --> 01:14:08,073
Do you always come to France to cycle?

589
01:14:11,719 --> 01:14:14,085
You were amateur, weren't you?

590
01:14:16,890 --> 01:14:19,620
In cycling, "amateur" is a category.

591
01:14:19,760 --> 01:14:21,990
I cycled for pleasure.

592
01:14:22,296 --> 01:14:25,026
That's what I said:
you're an amateur.

593
01:14:25,866 --> 01:14:30,326
The way up to Ventoux is the best place
to watch the Tour de France go by.

594
01:14:30,371 --> 01:14:33,101
About a mile before the top

595
01:14:33,140 --> 01:14:36,439
you can see who'll give way
and who'll try for a breakaway.

596
01:14:37,111 --> 01:14:39,739
That's where I saw Zoltemèque.

597
01:14:40,280 --> 01:14:43,579
One of your compatriots, Zoltemèque.

598
01:14:44,118 --> 01:14:44,982
Know him?

599
01:14:46,120 --> 01:14:49,487
Doesn't sound Dutch.
Sounds more like a Mexican god.

600
01:14:49,523 --> 01:14:51,218
It's Zoetemelk.

601
01:14:51,525 --> 01:14:53,288
Zoe-te-melk.

602
01:14:54,061 --> 01:14:55,494
Couldn't be more Dutch.

603
01:14:55,529 --> 01:14:57,360
It means "sweet milk."

604
01:14:57,398 --> 01:14:59,491
Mr. Sweetmilk?

605
01:15:00,300 --> 01:15:02,131
Some weird names you've got there.

606
01:15:02,302 --> 01:15:04,896
Naaktgeboren , "born naked."

607
01:15:06,273 --> 01:15:08,639
My neighbor has a dog called Rex.

608
01:15:13,113 --> 01:15:14,671
Dodeman.

609
01:15:15,783 --> 01:15:17,751
Mrs. Deadman.

610
01:15:18,352 --> 01:15:21,753
Marriage produces some
strange combinations.

611
01:15:23,290 --> 01:15:26,521
I know a woman called Friar-Towes.

612
01:15:26,560 --> 01:15:28,221
"Fry-her-toes."

613
01:15:30,030 --> 01:15:33,363
In the Nîmes phone book,
there's a guy called Poof!

614
01:15:42,976 --> 01:15:46,412
Ah, yes, we're not big on languages
in France. It's difficult.

615
01:16:52,875 --> 01:16:54,809
Oh, it's impossible...

616
01:16:57,347 --> 01:16:59,144
I'm wasting time...

617
01:17:10,126 --> 01:17:11,320
That's better.

618
01:17:14,931 --> 01:17:15,863
My car!

619
01:17:49,198 --> 01:17:51,029
I'll wait for you there.

620
01:18:47,156 --> 01:18:47,952
Asshole.

621
01:18:48,558 --> 01:18:49,388
Pardon?

622
01:18:50,159 --> 01:18:51,091
Nothing.

623
01:18:55,565 --> 01:18:57,965
I see you speak very good French.

624
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:00,059
It certainly makes things easier.

625
01:19:03,573 --> 01:19:06,133
My method wasn't very successful.

626
01:19:07,176 --> 01:19:10,668
I couldn't get the women
I wanted into my car.

627
01:19:10,713 --> 01:19:14,513
Prostitutes, yes.
But they don't interest me.

628
01:19:15,184 --> 01:19:17,277
They're more obvious victims.

629
01:19:17,720 --> 01:19:19,654
And nobody cares.

630
01:19:21,791 --> 01:19:24,419
So I was getting high blood pressure.

631
01:19:25,061 --> 01:19:26,995
Frustration.

632
01:19:47,550 --> 01:19:49,142
And now, the presents!

633
01:19:50,520 --> 01:19:52,078
Here's mine.

634
01:20:02,598 --> 01:20:05,089
Tiles, for the house at St. Côme.

635
01:20:41,203 --> 01:20:45,799
For your car keys.
And all the miles you have to drive...

636
01:20:48,210 --> 01:20:49,177
Thanks, darling.

637
01:20:55,751 --> 01:20:56,683
More?

638
01:20:59,021 --> 01:21:01,683
YOUR LIFE

639
01:21:04,493 --> 01:21:05,482
My glasses.

640
01:21:17,907 --> 01:21:20,239
- Look at his ears.
- Oh, he's so cute.

641
01:21:20,476 --> 01:21:21,966
A bit pudgy, huh?

642
01:21:25,581 --> 01:21:28,175
That's when you fell
from the balcony.

643
01:21:39,462 --> 01:21:42,056
It wasn't the trailer
that should be heavier...

644
01:21:42,098 --> 01:21:44,157
It was me who should be weaker!

645
01:21:47,970 --> 01:21:50,700
Here's the course of the Tour.
We're at the uphill climb

646
01:21:50,840 --> 01:21:53,365
of Col du Coq,
the most important stretch

647
01:21:53,509 --> 01:21:55,101
in this section of mountain passes.

648
01:21:55,144 --> 01:21:57,374
The game gets serious now,
on this 17th day.

649
01:21:57,413 --> 01:22:00,644
The Colombian Herrera, who'd left
the group behind has been overtaken...

650
01:22:00,683 --> 01:22:03,345
The close fight between Fignon
and Hinault is starting again.

651
01:22:03,386 --> 01:22:04,944
Hinault's pushing down hard...

652
01:22:05,087 --> 01:22:08,454
It's the third time he's tried
to break away from Fignon.

653
01:22:08,591 --> 01:22:11,151
But Fignon's not giving in.

654
01:22:11,293 --> 01:22:14,854
He's sure he'll be wearing
the yellow jersey tonight at I'Alpe d'Huez.

655
01:22:14,897 --> 01:22:17,263
The 2 men have now openly
drawn their swords...

656
01:22:17,299 --> 01:22:19,790
but they're stabbing each other
with "banderillas".

657
01:22:26,409 --> 01:22:30,106
But Fignon's not weakening...

658
01:22:30,246 --> 01:22:33,238
and now, going by the summit...

659
01:22:33,382 --> 01:22:41,084
Arroyo in front of Delgado,
Millar, Fignon and Hinault...

660
01:22:41,223 --> 01:22:42,713
The fight begins...

661
01:22:44,026 --> 01:22:46,256
One only has to top his adversary!

662
01:22:46,395 --> 01:22:47,919
It's a battle of the giants...

663
01:22:48,564 --> 01:22:49,656
And then you arrived.

664
01:22:50,700 --> 01:22:53,533
Your friend even kissed you
before she got out.

665
01:23:27,536 --> 01:23:32,439
Yes, we're 12 miles from the finish
line at the summit of I'Alpe d'Huez.

666
01:23:32,575 --> 01:23:34,770
We're part of an extraordinary event!

667
01:23:34,910 --> 01:23:38,869
I was right... Herrera wasn't to be
dismissed... I told you so.

668
01:23:39,014 --> 01:23:41,574
Hinault's putting on a brave face,
fighting with exceptional courage.

669
01:23:41,717 --> 01:23:44,345
He's giving Fignon
an open challenge.

670
01:23:44,487 --> 01:23:46,284
In a few words,
this is the situation...

671
01:23:46,422 --> 01:23:49,914
Herrera and Fignon will certainly
wear the yellow jersey tonight...

672
01:23:50,059 --> 01:23:51,788
barring catastrophe.

673
01:23:54,764 --> 01:23:55,890
Easy there!

674
01:24:10,576 --> 01:24:11,543
Broken?

675
01:24:16,816 --> 01:24:20,013
In Germany it's forbidden
to drive like that.

676
01:24:21,687 --> 01:24:23,518
Even as a passenger?

677
01:24:24,523 --> 01:24:29,392
I broke my arm when I was 1 1
years old. That was in 1 940.

678
01:24:29,995 --> 01:24:32,122
59. You're 59.

679
01:24:32,898 --> 01:24:36,959
I will be in November.
Right now, I'm still 58.

680
01:24:37,169 --> 01:24:39,034
Yes, but most of the year has passed,

681
01:24:39,171 --> 01:24:41,571
so there's more chance
that you'd be 59.

682
01:24:42,007 --> 01:24:44,475
Therefore, my assumption
was correct.

683
01:24:45,644 --> 01:24:46,736
Sorry.

684
01:24:47,446 --> 01:24:49,573
Excuse me, miss.

685
01:24:49,782 --> 01:24:51,545
- Do you speak French?
- Of course.

686
01:24:52,818 --> 01:24:54,445
Could you help me?

687
01:24:54,620 --> 01:24:57,783
I have a trailer. I need to hitch it
onto my car, but I can't do it alone.

688
01:24:58,357 --> 01:24:59,119
My car!

689
01:24:59,692 --> 01:25:01,660
Where's the trailer?

690
01:25:02,027 --> 01:25:04,689
Over there. I'll bring the car.

691
01:25:05,464 --> 01:25:08,262
I can come with you,
if you don't mind.

692
01:25:08,968 --> 01:25:09,866
Sure.

693
01:25:16,108 --> 01:25:18,201
But how can you drive?

694
01:25:18,377 --> 01:25:20,311
You'll see, no problem.

695
01:25:46,672 --> 01:25:47,832
Excuse me!

696
01:26:28,547 --> 01:26:29,912
Destiny, Mr. Hofman.

697
01:26:30,849 --> 01:26:32,646
If I hadn't sneezed...

698
01:26:54,607 --> 01:26:55,539
Excuse me, sir.

699
01:26:57,109 --> 01:26:58,201
Do you speak French?

700
01:26:59,211 --> 01:27:00,269
I am French.

701
01:27:01,246 --> 01:27:04,807
I don't have enough francs
for the vending machine.

702
01:27:04,950 --> 01:27:06,247
Do you have any change?

703
01:27:08,787 --> 01:27:12,154
Yes, so... I have 1 coin for 1 franc...

704
01:27:13,892 --> 01:27:15,291
and 2 coins for 2 francs...

705
01:27:15,427 --> 01:27:17,088
Do you have 5 francs?

706
01:27:21,600 --> 01:27:23,329
No, I don't have 5...

707
01:27:24,336 --> 01:27:27,669
But I do have 1 0,
and if you have 5...

708
01:27:28,007 --> 01:27:32,000
I don't have 5, but... 6... 7...

709
01:27:33,012 --> 01:27:36,175
Good, good. Sorry, sorry...
it's very kind but...

710
01:27:36,315 --> 01:27:39,910
I'd get change... I'd rather... Bye!

711
01:28:28,200 --> 01:28:32,899
I'm going to drive on the
highway for the first time.

712
01:28:34,339 --> 01:28:36,967
It's very good to speak French.

713
01:28:37,176 --> 01:28:40,304
My friend always says I must trying.

714
01:28:40,345 --> 01:28:41,277
Try.

715
01:28:44,950 --> 01:28:46,144
Your French is very good.

716
01:28:46,351 --> 01:28:49,377
No, you are...

717
01:28:51,857 --> 01:28:54,087
...a liar. Liar?

718
01:28:54,760 --> 01:28:55,886
Correct.

719
01:28:58,530 --> 01:29:00,020
Yes, look at me.

720
01:29:02,000 --> 01:29:04,560
In your hand, very pretty!

721
01:29:06,872 --> 01:29:10,035
Because my amigo , my amigo...

722
01:29:10,843 --> 01:29:12,333
I love him very much,

723
01:29:12,644 --> 01:29:16,102
and also has a name with...

724
01:29:16,315 --> 01:29:20,012
Rex, Roel, Roger...

725
01:29:20,152 --> 01:29:23,519
- Raymond.
- Raymond? Good.

726
01:29:24,623 --> 01:29:25,590
Is it possible...

727
01:29:26,592 --> 01:29:29,993
...for me buying a... a thing?

728
01:29:34,266 --> 01:29:35,824
I'm a salesman for these.

729
01:29:37,436 --> 01:29:40,132
I sell them.
I've got plenty in my car.

730
01:29:40,339 --> 01:29:41,363
Here?

731
01:29:41,673 --> 01:29:43,368
No, I don't...

732
01:29:43,842 --> 01:29:44,866
Yes?

733
01:29:46,245 --> 01:29:49,737
I... want... can...

734
01:29:52,518 --> 01:29:53,678
Shit.

735
01:29:54,920 --> 01:29:57,445
Want can to buy this thing?

736
01:29:57,790 --> 01:29:58,620
Why not?

737
01:29:59,491 --> 01:30:03,086
An "R"? Roel, Rex, Ray... Yes?

738
01:30:03,228 --> 01:30:04,627
- Why not?
- But... a lot?

739
01:30:06,799 --> 01:30:07,766
1 3.50 francs.

740
01:30:09,601 --> 01:30:10,659
Like the frisbee?

741
01:30:13,272 --> 01:30:14,534
I want very much!

742
01:30:31,056 --> 01:30:32,023
Tiles.

743
01:30:32,825 --> 01:30:34,588
- Oh, is called tiles?
- Yes.

744
01:30:34,760 --> 01:30:36,660
I want a tile with an "R".

745
01:30:46,705 --> 01:30:47,933
- Get in!
- Excuse me?

746
01:30:48,407 --> 01:30:49,465
Get in!

747
01:32:06,601 --> 01:32:09,399
Even the best laid plans can be...

748
01:32:11,806 --> 01:32:13,706
What's happening...?

749
01:32:27,789 --> 01:32:28,915
Just a bad connection.

750
01:32:29,557 --> 01:32:31,650
You weren't wearing
your seat belt, sir.

751
01:32:32,394 --> 01:32:33,418
I have a permit,

752
01:32:35,397 --> 01:32:36,625
a medical certificate.

753
01:32:40,869 --> 01:32:42,496
I'm claustrophobic.

754
01:32:46,674 --> 01:32:47,538
Correct.

755
01:32:50,245 --> 01:32:51,735
See what I was saying?

756
01:32:52,180 --> 01:32:57,015
The best plans can be wiped out at
any moment by what we call fate.

757
01:32:57,318 --> 01:32:59,479
I confess, that saddens me.

758
01:33:49,003 --> 01:33:50,027
Mr. Hofman!

759
01:34:06,354 --> 01:34:08,322
What did you do to her?

760
01:34:09,224 --> 01:34:11,454
I'll tell you.
I promised you that.

761
01:34:11,493 --> 01:34:15,953
But the only way to tell you, is to make
you share the exact same experience

762
01:34:16,364 --> 01:34:18,355
You're completely insane.

763
01:34:19,067 --> 01:34:20,830
It doesn't matter, really.

764
01:34:21,436 --> 01:34:23,996
So she isn't dead?

765
01:34:24,806 --> 01:34:26,330
Drink.

766
01:34:28,810 --> 01:34:30,710
What's in it?

767
01:34:30,979 --> 01:34:32,810
A sleeping pill.

768
01:34:32,847 --> 01:34:35,816
I drugged her and now
I'm going to drug you.

769
01:34:37,018 --> 01:34:38,007
And after?

770
01:34:40,154 --> 01:34:43,646
After, you'll experience
exactly what she did.

771
01:34:47,762 --> 01:34:52,131
If she's dead,
I'm also going to die.

772
01:34:53,935 --> 01:34:54,924
You're crazy.

773
01:34:57,138 --> 01:34:58,867
It's the only way.

774
01:35:00,675 --> 01:35:02,609
You can't be serious!

775
01:35:04,012 --> 01:35:06,480
I don't want to punish you.

776
01:35:06,514 --> 01:35:07,708
I'm not saying another word.

777
01:35:08,516 --> 01:35:09,983
I don't care about you.

778
01:35:10,885 --> 01:35:14,048
All I want to know is
what happened to her.

779
01:35:14,222 --> 01:35:15,849
I understand, Mr. Hofman.

780
01:35:15,890 --> 01:35:17,881
I've put myself in your shoes.

781
01:35:18,593 --> 01:35:21,892
In fact, I believe that you
don't want to punish me.

782
01:35:22,196 --> 01:35:25,563
But I'm not so certain I should.
Understand?

783
01:35:25,934 --> 01:35:29,802
I believe you,
but I must pretend that I don't.

784
01:35:32,240 --> 01:35:33,434
So, drink.

785
01:35:34,876 --> 01:35:37,106
It's truly the only way.

786
01:35:39,881 --> 01:35:41,041
What's in it?

787
01:35:41,849 --> 01:35:45,546
I've already told you:
a sleeping pill dissolved in coffee.

788
01:35:55,763 --> 01:35:58,960
The car keys.
I'd love to look at them one more time.

789
01:36:07,642 --> 01:36:11,942
Mr. Hofman, understand once
and for all:

790
01:36:14,082 --> 01:36:16,277
what use are these keys to you?

791
01:36:17,218 --> 01:36:18,480
You're powerless.

792
01:36:18,620 --> 01:36:19,644
You're bluffing!

793
01:36:20,521 --> 01:36:23,649
Assume you're right.
Can you be absolutely sure?

794
01:36:24,926 --> 01:36:26,860
That's where your problem lies.

795
01:36:29,397 --> 01:36:33,663
You must keep in mind the possibility
that there's no proof against me.

796
01:36:34,002 --> 01:36:36,334
That could spoil all your chances.

797
01:36:36,604 --> 01:36:40,472
Mr. Hofman, I've been analyzing
what goes in your head for the last 3 years.

798
01:36:40,508 --> 01:36:43,477
You can leave.
Even go to the police with the keys.

799
01:36:43,511 --> 01:36:48,039
But then, you'll never know
what happened to Miss Saskia.

800
01:36:49,283 --> 01:36:53,686
On the other hand, drink...
and you'll know.

801
01:36:54,322 --> 01:36:56,688
In less than 1 hour, I guarantee you.

802
01:36:58,893 --> 01:37:00,121
I know all I need to know.

803
01:37:00,762 --> 01:37:03,788
I don't care about the rest.
I'm leaving.

804
01:37:08,770 --> 01:37:10,362
And the uncertainty?

805
01:37:11,105 --> 01:37:13,835
The eternal uncertainty,
Mr. Hofman?

806
01:37:14,108 --> 01:37:15,871
That's the worst.

807
01:37:18,579 --> 01:37:20,638
I wanted to help you out!

808
01:39:26,300 --> 01:39:27,062
So?

809
01:39:30,872 --> 01:39:35,332
I told myself:
"Imagine you're drinking."

810
01:39:36,077 --> 01:39:40,309
Where is it predestined
I won't drink?

811
01:39:40,615 --> 01:39:45,484
So, to go against what is
predestined, I must drink.

812
01:39:47,421 --> 01:39:49,582
It takes 1 0 minutes to work.

813
01:39:52,627 --> 01:39:54,822
I drank it for her!

814
01:39:56,430 --> 01:40:01,424
Sure! She never left you the time
to fall out of love!

815
01:40:42,543 --> 01:40:46,570
Help! Help!

816
01:41:01,028 --> 01:41:03,360
Help!

817
01:41:20,314 --> 01:41:22,839
Oh no, it can't be!

818
01:42:07,862 --> 01:42:11,992
My name is Rex Hofman
and that's a bit weird...

819
01:42:15,169 --> 01:42:21,404
Rex Hofman... Rex Hof...

820
01:42:57,478 --> 01:42:58,775
Saskia!

821
01:43:07,455 --> 01:43:08,752
Saskia!

822
01:44:32,273 --> 01:44:35,902
MYSTERIOUS DOUBLE
DISAPPEARANCE

823
01:44:36,043 --> 01:44:43,176
AFTER SASKIA WAGTER
HER FRIEND REX HOFMAN...
