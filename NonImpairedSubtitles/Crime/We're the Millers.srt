1
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:03,719
Oh, my God...

2
00:00:03,920 --> 00:00:09,233
...it's full-on double rainbow all
the way across the sky!

3
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:11,637
Whoa!

4
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:14,274
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

5
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:17,040
Oh! Oh, my God!

6
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:19,635
Whoo!

7
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:21,637
What does this mean?

8
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:25,354
It's so bright.

9
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:27,755
Oh, my God,
it's so bright and vivid.

10
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,560
It's starting to look
like a triple rainbow.

11
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:32,358
Oh!

12
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:37,150
Going streaking across the quad!

13
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:46,832
Coochie, coochie, coochie!

14
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:53,633
Yeah. No, I know. Uh-huh.

15
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:56,308
No, I'm not. I'm not.
No, I'm paying attention.

16
00:00:56,720 --> 00:00:59,109
Mom, I'm listening. Just talk.

17
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:01,789
- Tyrone.
- Are you going trick-or-treating?

18
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:03,553
- No, because...
- Pow!

19
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:10,915
I'm in the car.
I'm literally in the car.

20
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:12,553
David, hey.
David Clark.

21
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:13,829
Rick Nathanson.

22
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:17,712
- Uh, I'm sorry. - Little Ricky.
We went to college together.

23
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:19,632
Oh, shit. Hey, dude.

24
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:23,276
We all took ecstasy at Dave Matthews
one time and I tried to kiss you.

25
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:25,832
That's right. I remember that. Yeah.

26
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:27,155
Yeah. "Crash. "

27
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:28,429
Yup.

28
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:31,552
Wow. I didn't recognize you.
You look very different.

29
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:33,876
I've gained a little
bit of daddy weight.

30
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:35,479
You know the drill.

31
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:37,238
Actually, I don't, no.

32
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:40,997
- No way. No way! Still a free agent.
- Mm.

33
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:44,351
You son of a bitch!
You lucky son of a bitch.

34
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:48,513
You lucky, lucky son of a bitch.
Wow, that's amazing. Wow.

35
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:52,074
Here. For old times' sake, huh?

36
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:54,029
For daddy stress.

37
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:56,399
You're still dealing weed?

38
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:58,433
Best in Denver.

39
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:01,316
That's fucking awesome.
Oh, my God.

40
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:03,435
That is so cool.

41
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:05,358
- You're still at it.
- Yeah.

42
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:07,630
- I envy you, man. I do.
- Ah.

43
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:10,513
Look at you. No wife, no kids.

44
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:12,079
- No responsibilities.
- Mm-hm.

45
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:14,555
Pfft, nothing. You got nothing.

46
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:17,149
You could disappear tomorrow
and who'd even know?

47
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:19,912
- Oh, what I wouldn't give.
- Yeah.

48
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:22,350
Oh, hey, I didn't mean
that in like, I mean...

49
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:25,199
No. It's all right. It doesn't bother me.
It's all right.

50
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:27,592
- Great seeing you.
- Great seeing you.

51
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:29,358
Okay, bud, I believe in you.

52
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:31,397
- Hey, David?
- Yeah?

53
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:34,235
- Facebook me. We'll get weird.
- I don't think so.

54
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:37,233
- Ha, ha! Get out of here.
- Good luck with the family.

55
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:40,792
Oh, fuck. Fuck me. Fuck.
Hey, great news.

56
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,911
We're gonna get high
and fuck tonight.

57
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:45,395
I'm sorry, honey.
Put Mommy on the phone, okay?

58
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:04,315
I'm-a take my skirt, boot, rings
All off

59
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:07,876
Skirt, boots, rings
All off

60
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:11,117
Ooh, baby, you so bad, boy
Drive me mad, boy

61
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:13,390
You don't care what they
Say about me

62
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:17,394
Girl is a problem
Girl is a problem, problem

63
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:26,793
Wow.

64
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,719
- You dance super good.
- Thanks.

65
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:31,990
I'm Kymberly. With a Y.

66
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:35,510
I'm Rose. With an R.

67
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:37,792
Is that your stage name?

68
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:39,871
- My what?
- Your stage name.

69
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:43,311
To protect yourself from the creeps
out there. You should pick one.

70
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:48,389
You know, something simple but sexy
and cute and short, maybe.

71
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:51,074
- Do you have a nickname?
- Totally!

72
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:52,508
Great. Use that, because...

73
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:54,631
I even got a tattoo of it.
Do you wanna see?

74
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:55,909
Uh, well, n...

75
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:57,314
Check it out.

76
00:04:57,560 --> 00:05:01,075
"Boner Garage. " Oh, whoa.

77
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:03,038
You got a little arrow there even.

78
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:04,998
Is that not like the hottest?

79
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:07,231
Boner Garage, you're up.

80
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:11,558
Oh, look at that. So excited
and full of life. That'll fade.

81
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:14,671
Hey, Rose. I know you're
"technically" on break,

82
00:05:15,002 --> 00:05:17,303
but I need a lap dance.
Table five.

83
00:05:17,338 --> 00:05:19,673
Just don't get too close.
The guy has two hook hands.

84
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:22,718
How did we let that
guy back in here?

85
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:25,390
Must have picked
the locks. Ha, ha!

86
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:54,874
How was work this evening?

87
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:56,189
What do you care?

88
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:57,515
I'm just asking.

89
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:58,948
Oh, just don't.

90
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:01,191
Fine. Well, is your dummy
boyfriend around?

91
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:03,709
No. Jimmy's with his parents. Why?

92
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:06,793
Well, because Jimmy still owes me
400 bucks, so...

93
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:09,430
Maybe you shouldn't loan drugs
to people.

94
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:12,351
- All right. Good tip.
- Mm-hm.

95
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:16,431
I was thinking is that maybe you
could help him out, settle his debt.

96
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:20,750
- Not a fucking chance.
- You'd be doing me a solid, neighbor.

97
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:23,394
Oh, really? Neighbor?
You're not a neighbor.

98
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:26,592
You're a drug dealer whose apartment
smells like cheese and feet.

99
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:29,678
Mm. Yeah, it's a candle
I got from Anthropologie.

100
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:32,758
Cheesy Feet. That's what they call it.
It's a bestseller.

101
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:36,709
Oh, Rose, got a piece of your mail here.

102
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:40,756
I'd lend you some money,
but we're not neighbors.

103
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,194
Oh, you're such a dick!

104
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:45,112
Have fun dying alone, jerk.

105
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:47,629
Have fun digging out the singles
from your crotch.

106
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:49,598
My crotch only takes 20s, David.

107
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,354
Hey, David.

108
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:58,592
- Hi, Kenny.
- I heard you and Mrs. O'Reilly fighting.

109
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:01,837
It's called flirting, Kenny.
You'll learn about it in college.

110
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:05,034
What are you doing up?
It's almost 2. Where's your mom?

111
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:09,233
- Uh, she went for a drink. With a friend.
- When?

112
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:11,273
Last week.

113
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:13,789
Uh, so I got the whole place to myself.

114
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,719
Yeah. Rolling Han Solo
for the weekend.

115
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:18,876
Mm-hm.

116
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:21,953
Um, speaking of rolling,
I was wondering if...

117
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:25,596
- I don't sell to kids, Kenny.
- I'm 18. I'm gonna get my own place soon.

118
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:26,875
Not a kid, David.

119
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:30,028
Yeah, you are. Take care.

120
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:32,835
Give me my fucking phone.

121
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:35,952
- You guys are such assholes.
- Hey, baby.

122
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:37,388
Leave her alone.

123
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:39,392
- Oh, I'm sorry, baby.
- Unhand her.

124
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:41,993
Hey, leave her alone.

125
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:45,711
Goddamn it, Kenny.

126
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:47,831
- Fucking tough guy, huh?
- You don't have to...

127
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:49,189
Hey! Hey, hey, hey.

128
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:51,715
Easy, easy. What's going on here?

129
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:55,959
- Mind your fucking business, old man.
- Oh, my God. You're a dude. Ha, ha!

130
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:59,556
That scared me. Your voice was so much
deeper than your bone structure.

131
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:01,751
These assholes are
trying to steal my iPhone.

132
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,036
You have an iPhone?
Aren't you homeless?

133
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:06,071
So? Fuck you, dude.

134
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:09,037
Okay, this was fun. Carry on.

135
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:10,878
- Come on, let's go.
- What? No.

136
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:13,316
These guys are picking on her
and it's not fair.

137
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:15,954
What you gonna do, white boy?
You some type of hero?

138
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:17,639
Not a hero. He's a dumb kid.

139
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:21,715
I got an idea. Leave the girl alone.
Just move along. Huh, what do you say?

140
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,069
- "Move along"?
- Yeah.

141
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:26,750
- What are you, some kind of cop?
- He's not a cop. He's actually really cool.

142
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:28,188
- Thanks.
- He's a drug dealer.

143
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:30,556
- Really?
- Goddamn it, Kenny.

144
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:31,875
Give me your backpack.

145
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:33,149
I don't wanna fight.

146
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:36,836
Well, there's not gonna be a fight.
See, you either give me the backpack...

147
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:39,554
...or I'm gonna stab you in the neck
and take it.

148
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:43,754
It's a real Sophie's choice here, huh?
All right.

149
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:45,275
Okay, backpack it is.

150
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:46,549
If you wa...

151
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:50,149
Run, Kenny!

152
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:53,549
You're dead meat!

153
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:02,313
Hey, sorry, I dropped my phone.
Are we still going out tonight or what?

154
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:05,718
Fucking shit! Shit!

155
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:09,873
Oh, shit.

156
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:18,958
Sorry. This is fucking dumb.

157
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:28,157
Whoa-ho-ho, motherfucker.

158
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:31,992
- We got you now.
- Unh!

159
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:35,272
- Do whatever's in the safe too.
- Look at that.

160
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:38,313
It's not even my money.
If you take that my boss will kill me.

161
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:42,358
You okay, David?
I can help. I'll call the cops.

162
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:43,999
No, I'm okay.

163
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:00,835
Hey!

164
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:03,277
Whoa, what the...! Unh!

165
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:05,471
When Mr. Brad calls,
you answer! Get in there!

166
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:17,517
Please don't tell me where
we're going. I love surprises.

167
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:20,350
- All right. Okay.
- Can I help you?

168
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:22,676
Hi. You ordered two black guys.

169
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:24,836
Oh. Okay. This guy.

170
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:27,349
No. David Clark here
to see Mr. Gurdlinger, please?

171
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:29,909
I'll tell him you're here.
Can I get you something?

172
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:31,917
Coffee. Tea. Fresca.

173
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:33,155
Hmm.

174
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:35,789
You know what,
a Fresca sounds really good.

175
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,319
- You got it.
- Appreciate it.

176
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:39,954
Hold on one second.
You guys want anything? It's on me.

177
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:41,315
Replenishes electrolytes.

178
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:44,193
Don't want you cramping up
when you jerk each other off.

179
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:45,469
Nice meeting you.

180
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:50,308
Easy.

181
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:52,358
Easy. Oof!

182
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:54,869
Okay. I'm gonna hang out here
if that's all right.

183
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:57,116
Oh, thank you for that.
That's very helpful.

184
00:10:57,320 --> 00:11:00,073
Oh! David Clark.

185
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:03,238
You're a hard man to find.
Take it easy on the plastic.

186
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:05,749
Whoa, Brad, what the fuck is this?

187
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:09,114
Look, man, I was gonna call you back.
Do not kill me.

188
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:11,436
- I got robbed, okay. I swear.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

189
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:12,755
What are you...? What...?

190
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:13,995
Oh, the plastic?

191
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:15,429
Yeah, the plastic.

192
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:16,675
I've seen Dexter.

193
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:21,476
Buddy, I'm putting in a new skylight,
you idiot. Ha, ha.

194
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:25,032
You should have seen your
face just now. You shit a brick.

195
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:27,352
Well, what am I supposed
to think, man?

196
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:30,358
You've got these thugs throwing a bag
over my head. Come on.

197
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:33,109
I'm sorry about that.
I didn't mean to freak you out.

198
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:36,312
- It's fine.
- You do know I've killed people though?

199
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:38,075
Yeah, Brad, I know.

200
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:39,474
Ha-ha. All right, have a seat.

201
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:42,593
Whoa, what the fuck is that?

202
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:46,071
What? Oh, my orca?
Yeah, I bought an orca.

203
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:49,312
I make a lot of money.

204
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:51,949
So you bought a whale?

205
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:53,673
Well, I don't like sports cars.

206
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:56,348
- Yeah, yeah.
- So where's my money, David?

207
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:59,148
Come on, man. We go back.

208
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:01,356
We do go back.
But it's not college anymore.

209
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:03,596
We're not selling lids
out of my dorm room.

210
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:06,360
And you owe me $43,000.

211
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:09,552
I told you, I got robbed, Brad.
They took everything I had, man.

212
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:12,832
This week's drop, 22 grand of my
money that I'd saved. I'm fucked.

213
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:18,154
Listen, this is a fucked-up situation.
But I might have a win-win for both of us.

214
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:21,440
- Great.
- I have a smidge of very choice...

215
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:23,312
...mari-ju-ana down in Mexico...

216
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:25,397
...and I need it here by Sunday night.

217
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:28,433
My regular courier is out
because he got gunned down.

218
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:29,908
That's where you come in.

219
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:32,715
You could be my mule.
I need someone I can trust.

220
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:36,515
Go to Mexico, bring it back by Sunday night,
not only will I forgive your debt...

221
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:41,077
...I will pay you a standard
courier fee of $100,000.

222
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:44,357
You're gonna give me 100 grand to move
a smidge across the border?

223
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:47,435
Smidge and a half. It's nothing.

224
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:50,632
Dude, I got rolled
by the fucking cast of Annie.

225
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:54,389
I come walking in here and you ask me
to be an international drug dealer.

226
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:57,876
This is easy money, David.
All you gotta do is pop down to Mexico...

227
00:12:58,080 --> 00:13:01,516
...go to this address, tell them you're
there to pick up for Pablo Chacon.

228
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:03,836
- Who the fuck is Pablo Chacon?
- I am.

229
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:10,755
You don't get respect from Mexicans
when your name is Brad Gurdlinger, right?

230
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:15,511
I mean, that's white in any language.
See? Big Bad Brad thought of everything.

231
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:22,079
I don't know. I don't think so, man.
This is way out of my league.

232
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:23,673
It's a federal crime.

233
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:27,793
If I try to cross the border with more
than a pound, you're talking like, um...

234
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:31,997
Twenty-five years in Mexican prison.
If you get a happy judge.

235
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:34,231
Yeah. Jeez. Not good.

236
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:36,954
- Although, you're forgetting one thing.
- What?

237
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:39,515
You don't have a fucking choice.

238
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:45,433
So now you're gonna become
an even bigger drug dealer?

239
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:47,995
Drug smuggler, Kenny.
There's a difference.

240
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:53,989
You're probably gonna get
searched at the border.

241
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:56,710
No offense, you look like
a total drug dealer.

242
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:59,593
- No shit. Thanks, dude.
- You could wear a disguise.

243
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:01,593
- What?
- A disguise.

244
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:03,472
That's what I thought. A disguise.

245
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:06,672
I dress up. What's the hot
Halloween outfit these days?

246
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:09,599
Bane from Batman? Someone like that?
Wear something over my face?

247
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:12,553
There's no drugs in here.
You've got nothing to worry about.

248
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:13,875
Great idea.

249
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:18,314
Hey, pardon me. Hi.

250
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:23,150
Hate to bug you, but I'm trying to get
the fam to the zoo and I'm lost as all heck.

251
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:24,918
Fuck off, real-life Flanders.

252
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:26,978
It's my fault.

253
00:14:27,285 --> 00:14:31,113
When it comes to reading maps,
I sure can be an old flibbertigibbet.

254
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:33,712
Hey. No parking here, sir.

255
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:35,399
Perfect. Fucking tourists.

256
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:38,029
Oh, jeez. I'm awful sorry, officer.

257
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:40,151
I don't know which way is up around here.

258
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:42,999
No problem.
Our city can get confusing sometimes.

259
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:44,758
Trying to find our way to the zoo.

260
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:48,794
It's two blocks up that way,
take a left, two blocks...

261
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:55,829
Holy fucking shit.

262
00:14:57,760 --> 00:14:59,193
Thank you, dickheads.

263
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:03,437
Hey little lady, don't you say maybe

264
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:06,518
Rose, the guy at the bar asked for you
by name.

265
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:08,119
Treat him nice.

266
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:10,550
Baby, I'ma show you how to

267
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:11,869
Yeah!

268
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:13,958
Hi. I'm Rose.

269
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:17,718
- Hi. Hi.
- What...? Oh, please. No.

270
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:19,956
- No, Rose. Hey, Rose, Rose.
- No, no, no, no.

271
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:22,515
- Please. Listen to me.
- Duh, duh, duh, duh.

272
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:24,632
Ch-ch-ch-chuh.

273
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:29,319
You asshole.

274
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:33,393
Don't worry. You don't have
to get naked and all that stuff.

275
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:36,919
- Unless you want to, you know. Oof!
- Mm-hm.

276
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:38,388
- Fuck.
- What do you want?

277
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:43,511
How would you like to spend 4th of July
weekend making 10 grand?

278
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:44,789
- What?
- Rose, listen.

279
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:47,713
All I'm asking is that you
go to Mexico with me.

280
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:51,113
All right? And then we drive
home together in an RV.

281
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:52,389
Mm-hm.

282
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:55,068
- And that RV has some pot in it.
- Drug dealing?

283
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:58,033
No, it's not drug dealing. It's not.
No, it's smuggling.

284
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:00,390
- Are you out of your mind?
- Rose, listen to me.

285
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:05,311
Now, me crossing the border by myself,
huge red flag. Huge, all right?

286
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:07,630
But families,
they don't get a second look.

287
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:10,718
So, Rose, I need you to be my wife.

288
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:13,870
That is the dumbest thing
I've ever heard.

289
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:17,629
Look, Rose, 10,000 bucks,
and your flight's already paid for.

290
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:19,193
You can't buy me.

291
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:22,358
I'm not buying you, all right?
I'm renting you.

292
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:23,595
Hmm.

293
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:24,995
Like Pretty Woman.

294
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:28,031
Pretty Woman?
She was a prostitute.

295
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:29,912
And I don't trust you.

296
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:37,159
- What did she say?
- What the fuck do you think? She said no.

297
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:39,712
Cool. So I guess
it's just us, then.

298
00:16:40,029 --> 00:16:42,084
A little father and son
bonding trip to Mexico.

299
00:16:42,119 --> 00:16:43,004
Are you kidding me?

300
00:16:43,443 --> 00:16:46,160
You and me alone in a van?
It'll look like the pervert Olympics.

301
00:16:46,195 --> 00:16:47,870
No way. Absolutely not.
No, we need a girl.

302
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:51,675
And unless you can think of someone
that can leave town tomorrow, I'm fucked.

303
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:54,479
I know a girl.

304
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:00,276
I don't get it. What's in it for me?

305
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:04,678
I'm thinking a roof over your head,
some actual hot food. That'd be good enough.

306
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:06,154
I'm thinking 1000.

307
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:09,671
Fine, 1000 bucks, but that's it.

308
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:14,118
Great. And if we get caught I'll say you
drugged and kidnapped me. Cool?

309
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:18,237
Yeah, it's cool. Yeah, that's fine.
But that's it.

310
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:20,791
Kenny, meet your new sister.

311
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:23,795
This is great.
I've always wanted a sister.

312
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:29,477
- Get it off me. Get it off! Get off!
- Hey, come on. Let go.

313
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:32,399
- Come on. We gotta clean you up.
- What's wrong with you?

314
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:35,319
- Don't say that. - I didn't mean
to make her uncomfortable.

315
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:36,635
# Wild child

316
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:38,398
Boner Garage!

317
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:41,160
# Going all out
Going for broke

318
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:45,595
Oh, great. Rose,
I'm glad I caught you.

319
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:49,031
I wanted to go over a couple
of minor policy changes...

320
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:52,038
- ... that we have here at the club.
- Like what?

321
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:55,550
Like, I want you to start having sex
with the customers for money.

322
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:59,557
What? That's totally illegal, Todd.

323
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:01,279
Come on, what are you gonna do?

324
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:06,076
I gotta stay competitive with those
fuckers who opened up across the street.

325
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:07,713
You mean the Apple Store?

326
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:09,353
Yeah, and they're killing us.

327
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:10,794
Oh, God.

328
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,958
That's it. I can't do it. I quit.

329
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:15,874
Did you hear the good news?

330
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:18,355
Now we get to fuck the customers
for money.

331
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:21,029
- Wha...?
- Boner Garage loves it.

332
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:25,353
I'm out of here. I am out of here.
I quit.

333
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:36,675
Fuck.

334
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:38,355
Fuck.

335
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:04,556
So, Casey, I guess it's nice for you
to get your hair cut.

336
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:06,273
Being homeless and all...

337
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:10,109
I'm not homeless, fucktard. I have a home.
But I left because my parent...

338
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:14,552
Shut up, okay? Please. I don't need
to hear your hard-luck backstory right now.

339
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:19,356
I rented Precious on Netflix eight months
ago and I still haven't watched the thing.

340
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:20,629
Here. You know what?

341
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:24,190
Just give me a little peace and quiet
and buy yourself some new clothes.

342
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:27,710
You know, the kind of stuff that loved
children wear. Not this garbage.

343
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:29,433
All right? Thank you.

344
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:30,829
Whoa, whoa, whoa, stop.

345
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:34,596
You're fine.
You already like a total dipshit.

346
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,912
Here. You're gonna need it.
You look like Eminem from 8 Mile.

347
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:42,516
Go with her.
Make sure she doesn't steal it.

348
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:44,597
And stay the fuck out of Hot Topic.

349
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:46,388
David Clark?

350
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:49,390
Okay, what are we doing today?

351
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:52,558
Yeah, I say,
give me something that says:

352
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:56,958
"I get up every morning at 5:30
and commute for an hour to a bullshit job...

353
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:59,760
...where my boss expects me
to kiss his balls all day...

354
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:03,953
...so I can afford to keep my ungrateful
kids decked out in Dora the Explorer shit...

355
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:06,151
...and my wife up to her fat ass
in self-help videos...

356
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:09,273
...until the day I get the courage
to put a shotgun in my mouth. "

357
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:12,994
Right here.

358
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:15,831
Yeah. That's it. That's the one.

359
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:48,189
All right.

360
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:01,199
Get a full body check.

361
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:21,913
Sorry.

362
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:25,796
Hi, you folks have everything you need?

363
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:27,394
Oh, you betcha!

364
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:31,673
Yeah, we're heading out on a family vacay
here, you know? Off to see grandma, huh?

365
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:33,998
Well, you have a lovely family.

366
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:37,510
Oh, thank you very much. Yeah,
this is my son, Kenny Miller, right here.

367
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:40,029
- And my lovely daughter...
- Casey?

368
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:43,357
Casey. Casey Miller, that's right.
And I'm David Miller.

369
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:44,595
We're the Millers.

370
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:48,634
Yeah, now, you know, I got my hands
full here. Couple of kooky teenagers.

371
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:52,629
Yeah, I'm going through all those
typical teenage girl issues like:

372
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:55,479
Finals and college applications...

373
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:57,995
...and am I gonna get asked to prom.

374
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:00,668
Plus, I haven't gotten my period in
two months...

375
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,912
...which is really weird because
I've mostly just been doing anal.

376
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:08,472
Ha-ha-ha! Oh, that's enough.

377
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,719
Well, thank you for your help, "Natalie. "

378
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:15,238
Take your seats, please.

379
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:18,635
You fucking kidding me?

380
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:20,796
I'm good. I got it.
Right over here. Thanks.

381
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,911
Thank you. Sorry.

382
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:27,557
- Honey! Hi! You made it!
- Mm-hm. Eat a dick.

383
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:29,273
- Sorry, sorry. Okay.
- Mm-mm.

384
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:32,756
- Wow, you look really, like...
- Don't. Just don't, all right?

385
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:34,195
Hi, Mom.

386
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:35,549
- Jesus.
- Mm-hm.

387
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:37,713
And who's that?

388
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:40,718
Well, that's your daughter. Casey.

389
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:42,275
Hey.

390
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:43,754
Mm-hm.

391
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,274
I want 30,000 now.

392
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:48,115
- No fucking way.
- Okay. Have a safe flight.

393
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:52,279
What? No. Okay. Fine!
Fine. Bloodsucker.

394
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:56,393
Mm. All right, happy wife,
happy life. Hi, kids!

395
00:22:57,720 --> 00:22:59,915
- Make room for your mother.
- Okay.

396
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:04,352
- Hey!
- Whoa! No, I didn't...!

397
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:07,518
What the fuck? Don't you ever think
that you can ever...

398
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:09,995
Family meeting. Let's go.
Get in the back. Go.

399
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:11,912
- I didn't mean to.
- I don't care.

400
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:16,199
- He just hit me in the fucking face.
- Will you march? No one wants to hear...

401
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:20,791
What the fuck?!
Are you kidding me?

402
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:23,435
Oh, come on, relax, Dorothy. Jesus.

403
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:26,200
We're not at the border.
Who cares what they think?

404
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:29,312
It's about not drawing attention
to ourselves, you little hobo.

405
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:31,831
Hey! Don't talk to her like that.

406
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:35,032
Rose, relax, okay? The only thing
you need to worry about...

407
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:37,959
...is making them think you could
be someone's mother. Okay?

408
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:40,549
Are you kidding me?
I can do this shit in my sleep.

409
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:42,079
Excuse me.

410
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:47,795
Lord, we thank thee for the blessing
of this family vacation.

411
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:50,548
May David find his bliss
and bring us home back safely.

412
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:53,877
May Kenny and Casey fortify
their sibling bond...

413
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:57,197
...over the warm glow
of our devoted hearts.

414
00:23:57,600 --> 00:24:01,229
And may this entire airplane
find safe passage...

415
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:03,476
...and a bountiful life.

416
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:05,354
Even the Jews.

417
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:08,199
- Amen.
- That was a good one.

418
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:09,879
That was beautiful.

419
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:12,355
- Oh.
- I wish my family was more like that.

420
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:14,232
Oh, stop. Don't.

421
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:17,876
No, no, no. Come on. Come in here.
Hug it out. Don't you cry.

422
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:19,195
Aw, honey.

423
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:21,559
Fuck you.

424
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:23,592
All better now? Okay.

425
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:27,913
Oh, and don't forget you can use Chex Mix
as a surprise casserole topping.

426
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:29,917
Adds that real special crunch.

427
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:31,997
- Wow, what a great tip.
- Sure!

428
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:33,355
Bye-bye.

429
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:36,276
Holy shit, where did that come from?

430
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:39,313
It's five summers with my Aunt Barb
in Oklahoma.

431
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:40,589
That was amazing.

432
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:42,552
Calm down. It wasn't that great.

433
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:46,309
Ah, goddamn it. Brad said the RV was
supposed to be out here waiting for us.

434
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:48,511
Anybody sees a camper, just let me know.

435
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:50,195
Whoa.

436
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:02,872
What the fuck is this?

437
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:04,195
This thing is ridiculous.

438
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:07,758
- Can you drive this?
- I don't know.

439
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:09,359
How fast does it go?

440
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:44,036
Why the hell are you
reading that thing?

441
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:48,873
Because I like it. It's fun.

442
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:50,399
It's informative.

443
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:52,511
"It's fun. "
That's your idea of fun, huh?

444
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:55,359
I have a VCR manual from the '90s
you should check out.

445
00:25:55,560 --> 00:25:58,313
- I think you'd probably enjoy that.
- Fireworks!

446
00:25:58,520 --> 00:26:00,033
Oh, my God, guys, look!

447
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:02,840
Fireworks! Hey! Fireworks!
Pull over! There's fireworks!

448
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:04,672
We're not pulling over for fireworks.

449
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:07,269
- Oh, oh, stern.
- What? It's Fourth of July weekend.

450
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:09,436
Don't be such a grumpy asshole. Pull over!

451
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:10,914
No. Absolutely not.

452
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:12,752
Oh, come on, I vote fireworks too.

453
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,958
See? Even this loser wants fireworks.
Fireworks!

454
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:18,469
- Fireworks! Fireworks!
- The kids wanna see fireworks.

455
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:20,472
Fireworks! Fireworks! Fireworks!

456
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:21,835
Okay, enough!

457
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:28,755
Enough! Let's get something
straight right now!

458
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:30,871
You are not my kids! Okay?

459
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:33,635
You are not my wife!
And we are not a family!

460
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:35,273
All right? This is a job!

461
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:36,993
We are not the Brady Bunch!

462
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:39,913
I'm Marky Mark
and y'all are the Funky Bunch!

463
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:43,513
- The what?
- I'm the boss. You hear me?

464
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:48,635
So cut the shit! Otherwise, I will turn
this RV around immediately!

465
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:52,475
And we will drive straight home.
No drugs for anyone!

466
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:54,029
This vacation sucks.

467
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:55,593
You...

468
00:26:56,120 --> 00:26:57,633
It is not a vacation!

469
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:07,591
There we go. You fucking happy?
Come on.

470
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:21,189
Here we go. Everybody
just be cool. All right?

471
00:27:22,280 --> 00:27:23,474
Hey there!

472
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:26,911
You got the Miller family here,
reporting for leisure, sir.

473
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:29,390
We're just heading down
to México way to do a...

474
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:35,876
Oh. Okay. Great. Fantastic. All right,
thank you. Take care, now. All right.

475
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:41,476
Whoo! Did you see that? I told you
this RV would work! We totally blend.

476
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:44,393
Congratulations.
You just snuck into Mexico.

477
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:51,515
What is this?

478
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:53,392
- A meth lab?
- It's Mexico, Casey.

479
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:55,352
That's a donkey, donkey, donkey.

480
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:59,076
- This RV blends right in, David.
- Will you calm down?

481
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:02,392
This thing is ginormous.
I mean, it's ridiculous.

482
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:11,356
You have arrived at
your destination.

483
00:28:11,560 --> 00:28:13,471
The route guidance is now finished.

484
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:15,671
Are you sure these guys
are expecting you?

485
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:17,592
Rose, we're good. All right?

486
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:21,150
Now will you calm down? These are
Brad's guys. Nothing to worry about.

487
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:22,952
Open Sesame. Here we go.

488
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:24,714
Hey!

489
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:27,396
Hey, I think that guy
was in La Bamba.

490
00:28:28,280 --> 00:28:31,113
Is that a little football over there?
That's fun. Soccer.

491
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:32,833
Kids are a good sign, I guess.

492
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:40,629
- Hey there.
- What is this place?

493
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:43,957
Will you look at this? It's a cute
little drug-dealing community.

494
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:45,792
They probably sell churros.

495
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:48,478
Will you relax?

496
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:50,830
It's fine. We're totally fine.

497
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:52,725
I'll run in there,

498
00:28:53,002 --> 00:28:55,825
pick up a duffel bag, a suitcase or
something and we'll be on our way.

499
00:28:55,860 --> 00:28:58,989
Hi. Now come on.
See, it's the welcome wagon.

500
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:00,428
Let me go talk to this guy.

501
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:05,109
Hola. Hola, big man, me llamo David.

502
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:07,629
Yeah, I'm here to pick
up for Brad Gurdlinger.

503
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:10,835
- Oh.
- He's got a gun.

504
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:13,235
- Oh, God.
- Whoa, whoa. Hey, hey, hey!

505
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:16,916
- Oh, God.
- Palo Hacon! Palo Hacon!

506
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:18,473
Pablo Chacon?

507
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:23,394
Pablo Chacon. I'm here to pick up
for Pablo Chacon.

508
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:25,909
You are the White Gringo
with the haircut of a donkey.

509
00:29:26,120 --> 00:29:27,917
Uh, yeah. Sí.

510
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:31,709
Yeah. Yeah, mucho white-o.
Very, very gringo. Yeah.

511
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:35,754
- Who are they?
- Um, that's my "family. "

512
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,150
You know, uh, mi familia.

513
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:41,397
You know, helping me out here
with the deal. Yeah.

514
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:45,193
Yeah.

515
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:47,834
Yeah. I know,
I can't believe it either.

516
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:50,872
Do you see his eye? Jesus Christ.

517
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:54,678
Come! Drugs now.

518
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:56,677
- Okay, great.
- What?

519
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:58,518
That's great. Let's do it. Okay.

520
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:03,596
All right, big fella, where's the smidge
of weed everyone's talking about?

521
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:18,073
- This is a little more than a smidge.
- Oh, dear.

522
00:30:18,280 --> 00:30:19,952
Calm down. Okay?
We're gonna be fine.

523
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:21,559
Oh, yeah, sure, right.

524
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:24,672
All we're doing is smuggling
two metric tons of marijuana...

525
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:28,196
...across an international border
in a rented motor home!

526
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:31,439
I don't see what could
possibly go wrong! Ugh!

527
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:35,838
Okay, uh, I'm gonna
make a phone call real quick.

528
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:38,595
Kenny, watch the pot.

529
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:45,909
It's a great place.

530
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:47,839
Fuck you.

531
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,433
Hey. Buddy.

532
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:04,229
I'm gonna let you in on a little secret.
I'm like an amazing sculptor.

533
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:06,994
- What are you talking about?
- I've been working all day.

534
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:11,597
It's an orca and he's breaching
and I'm balls deep in his blow hole.

535
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:12,835
What the fuck?

536
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:14,075
Uh-oh, something wrong?

537
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:16,879
Yeah! Something's wrong.
Something's very, very wrong. Okay?

538
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:18,359
You said "a smidge of pot. "

539
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:20,118
This is not a smidge.

540
00:31:20,280 --> 00:31:21,759
- Smidge and a half? No?
- No.

541
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:25,117
You got me moving enough weed
to kill Willie-fucking-Nelson, man!

542
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:30,312
Okay? They're using a goddamn bucket
brigade to put it on the RV as we speak!

543
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:34,189
You walked in, told them you were picking up
for Pablo Chacon and they were like:

544
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:36,158
- "No problem!"
- Wait a minute.

545
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:39,392
Why do you sound surprised?
You told them we were coming, right?

546
00:31:39,560 --> 00:31:40,595
Relax!

547
00:31:40,760 --> 00:31:44,799
Everything's gonna be fine, man. I greased
the guard in lane one at the border.

548
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,719
He'll let you breeze through,
I'll see you in the morning!

549
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:49,239
I'll even buy you brunch.

550
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:51,272
Can I change the subject for a second?

551
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:53,271
If you get back and see the sculpture...

552
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:56,591
...you're gonna look at it and be like,
"Whoa, those balls are huge. "

553
00:31:56,760 --> 00:31:59,433
The balls are the only part
that are not anatomically correct.

554
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:01,119
Everything else is perfect.

555
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:05,432
But I made the balls a little larger
as a tribute to my manhood.

556
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:06,749
Fuck you, Brad.

557
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:08,876
That's the David I love!

558
00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:11,600
Fuck you too! Come on, let's do this!

559
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:13,591
Ha, ha! I'll see you soon,
my little drug mule!

560
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:15,239
Hee-haw! Hee-haw! Hee-haw...

561
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:17,709
Shit!

562
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:24,709
Oh, no. Thank you. I'm good.

563
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:27,833
You reject my mother's gift?

564
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:31,919
I mean, I don't know
whether I'd put it in those terms.

565
00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:34,111
- Shut up and take the fruit.
- Right. Got it.

566
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:35,435
Thank you, ma'am.

567
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:37,477
- You wanna get us killed?
- What?

568
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:39,389
Namaste.

569
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:48,869
Whoa.

570
00:32:49,080 --> 00:32:51,275
I think Snoop Dogg
would fuck this fridge.

571
00:32:51,520 --> 00:32:52,839
At least it keeps it fresh.

572
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:57,429
Well, as long as no one sets foot
inside the RV...

573
00:32:57,640 --> 00:33:00,473
...looks through a window,
or weighs us...

574
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:04,159
- ... we should be pretty good.
- We'll be fine.

575
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:06,238
We're totally fucked.

576
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:25,358
Aw, shit. What the hell is this?

577
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:28,068
- What's it look like? It's a cop, genius.
- Be cool.

578
00:33:28,280 --> 00:33:31,875
- Remember we're the Millers. Okay.
- Okay. Yeah. Okay. Cool.

579
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:35,475
- Oh. Buenos dias, officer.
- Hola.

580
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:38,433
I'm sorry if we were violating
some of your traffic laws.

581
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:41,871
You see, the family and I got into
a heated game of road bingo and...

582
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:44,111
- Cut the shit.
- I'm sorry?

583
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:46,834
I saw you leaving
Pablo Chacon's compound.

584
00:33:47,080 --> 00:33:50,072
And we both know if I search
your mobile home, what I'd find.

585
00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:52,271
Much prison time for such things.

586
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:53,799
Yeah. Yeah.

587
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:56,231
But I don't feel like arresting anybody...

588
00:33:56,440 --> 00:33:59,750
...so I'll just simply take my bribe
and I'll be on my way.

589
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:04,071
Well, all right. Ha, ha.

590
00:34:04,560 --> 00:34:07,757
This is what I'm talking about.
Great! How much we talking? 100? 200?

591
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:10,190
- One thousand.
- A thousand?

592
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:13,113
- Mm-hm.
- What, are you buying a house down here?

593
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:17,913
It's a lot. Um, we don't have
that sort of cash on us right now.

594
00:34:20,160 --> 00:34:21,991
You see, that's gonna be a problem.

595
00:34:22,240 --> 00:34:23,355
Yeah, yeah.

596
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:26,916
Maybe you can offer me
something else. Say, uh...

597
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:30,316
...something a little more personal?

598
00:34:32,080 --> 00:34:34,389
- Oh.
- Oh.

599
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:38,115
I gotcha. Rose, suck his dick.

600
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:41,431
Fuck you, I'm not sucking anything.

601
00:34:41,680 --> 00:34:43,398
Come on. Will you be a team player?

602
00:34:43,640 --> 00:34:46,234
- Are you fucking kidding me?
- Will you stop being selfish?

603
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:48,749
Please, please, señora.
No need to be alarmed.

604
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:54,235
See, I'm, how you say, a man who
prefers the company of other men.

605
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,877
- Oh.
- Oh.

606
00:34:58,360 --> 00:35:00,715
- David, suck his dick.
- Rose.

607
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:03,434
Five seconds tops.
Just cradle the balls.

608
00:35:03,640 --> 00:35:04,993
Mm.

609
00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:08,232
Come on, David. Be a team player.
You're gonna have fun.

610
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:11,638
Um...

611
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:15,033
Okay. Kenny! Front and center, buddy.

612
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:16,878
Uh...

613
00:35:17,080 --> 00:35:18,308
Okay, so what's the plan?

614
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:21,318
Go up there and pretend to
and then you're gonna jump him?

615
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:22,794
The plan is, um...

616
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:24,228
Here. Come here, come here.

617
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:27,677
Okay, um, let's see.
You, you're this bottle cap.

618
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:30,678
Right? And I am this cigarette butt.

619
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:34,589
Okay, that's us. All right? Okay?
He's over there, right by this, that bush.

620
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:35,994
We'll make him the pebble.

621
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:39,875
You will go and meet him behind
the bush right over there.

622
00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:42,116
You suck his dick,
and we get outta here.

623
00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:44,828
- Okay? Bring it in, on three.
- What?! No!

624
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:46,712
What do you mean no?
What's wrong?

625
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:49,593
- Well, I'm not gay.
- Are you sure?

626
00:35:50,680 --> 00:35:52,671
I mean, you never really know
until you know.

627
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:55,275
- No. I'm not gay.
- Okay. All right. Calm down.

628
00:35:55,480 --> 00:35:59,473
Look, this gay panic situation you're having
now, it's coming off a little homophobic.

629
00:36:00,080 --> 00:36:02,389
What, because I don't want
a penis in my mouth?

630
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:05,034
Exactly. It's exactly
what homophobic means.

631
00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:08,835
Look, you go over there, you just,
you know, you pretend it's a girl's dick.

632
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:10,593
Any girl's dick you want.

633
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:13,553
- I'm not sure I agree with that logic.
- Look, listen to me.

634
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:17,159
- What is he saying to him?
- I have no idea.

635
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:19,391
All right? Just listen to me. All right?

636
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:20,715
Come on, man.

637
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:23,309
This is your chance to be the hero.

638
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:26,835
- I don't know, David.
- Don't do it for me.

639
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:30,430
Don't even do it for you.
Do it for the girls. For Rose and Casey.

640
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:33,677
Because, believe me, they won't last
two days in a Mexican prison.

641
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:37,832
- Okay.
- Attaboy!

642
00:36:39,080 --> 00:36:41,116
- I'll do it for the girls.
- I'm proud of you.

643
00:36:42,040 --> 00:36:44,076
Hey. What's going on?

644
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:46,840
Somebody sucking my dick,
or am I getting 1000 pesos?

645
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:48,598
No, he's gonna w...

646
00:36:49,360 --> 00:36:51,794
- "Pesos"? Why didn't you say so?
- Mm-hm. A thousand.

647
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:55,072
Oh, well, that's like, what, 80 bucks
American?

648
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:57,589
Here. Here you go.
A hundred. Keep the change.

649
00:37:04,840 --> 00:37:08,037
Can't believe you were gonna suck
that guy's dick. Come on, let's go.

650
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:22,676
All vehicles, please proceed
slowly in assigned lanes...

651
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:24,638
...and prepare for vehicle inspection.

652
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:28,999
Okay, here we go. This is it.

653
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:30,633
Kenny, grab the hats. Hurry.

654
00:37:31,120 --> 00:37:33,634
You said the guard was just
gonna wave us through.

655
00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:37,230
He will. But let's look the part so
the others don't get suspicious.

656
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:45,719
What the fuck does this guy want?

657
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:47,638
I don't know. But he's honking.

658
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:50,908
- Hi!
- Just ignore them.

659
00:37:51,320 --> 00:37:55,677
Okay, he's really honking and it's making a
huge scene. I think he just wants to say hi.

660
00:37:55,960 --> 00:37:57,439
Oh, my God. I don't wanna say hi.

661
00:37:57,640 --> 00:37:59,915
They're just waving. If we just wave,
he'll stop.

662
00:38:00,120 --> 00:38:01,838
Fine. I'll say hi. Fine.

663
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:03,675
- Hi!
- Hi!

664
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:06,957
Howdy-doody! Quite a rig you got there,
amigo.

665
00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:11,278
That is quite a rig
you guys have there too.

666
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:13,948
Well, thank you very kindly.
We do love her.

667
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:17,311
We don't take her out as often as
we used to when our girl was small.

668
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:22,276
It can be such a bear to carve out quality
family time but you gotta do it, don't you?

669
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:24,596
Yeah, David and Rose Miller here.

670
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:25,915
Oh.

671
00:38:26,120 --> 00:38:29,795
This is my daughter, Casey, right here.
And my son, Kenny.

672
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:33,359
- How handsome.
- Pleased to make your acquaintance.

673
00:38:33,560 --> 00:38:36,233
Don Fitzgerald,
my smoldering wife, Edith...

674
00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:38,237
...and our daughter. Say hi, Melissa.

675
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:51,031
- Lane one, please pull forward.
- Oh.

676
00:38:51,240 --> 00:38:53,674
Sir. Sir, please pull forward.

677
00:38:56,920 --> 00:38:58,194
I got a joint here.

678
00:38:59,240 --> 00:39:01,310
- Shut down lane one.
- It's medicinal.

679
00:39:01,560 --> 00:39:02,993
- What'd he say?
- He has a joint.

680
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:04,633
That's it?

681
00:39:07,840 --> 00:39:08,875
- Hide it.
- Okay.

682
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:10,832
Get rid of it! Oh, my God!

683
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:12,473
Holy shit.

684
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:14,831
- Oh, that was so close.
- You have a baby!

685
00:39:15,360 --> 00:39:17,999
- Oh, I love babies!
- Oh.

686
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:20,760
Oh, look at that gorgeous
little bundle of joy!

687
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,116
What's that beautiful
little baby's name?

688
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:27,031
- This is our little...
- LeBron.

689
00:39:27,360 --> 00:39:28,998
- Name's LeBron.
- Yup.

690
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:31,475
- Oh.
- A little French fella.

691
00:39:31,720 --> 00:39:32,755
It's our little LeBron.

692
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:36,396
I was against the name at first, but
the missus has a real soft spot...

693
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:38,676
...for prima donnas who'll never
be as good as Jordan.

694
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:40,393
I can't see the face.

695
00:39:41,080 --> 00:39:44,993
- I'm dying to see his face.
- Sir, pull forward to lane two.

696
00:39:45,360 --> 00:39:48,477
- Oh, fuck! Okay, put on the hats.
- You gotta pull over.

697
00:39:48,680 --> 00:39:51,069
- Here we go.
- Great.

698
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:55,319
- My God, I feel like a fucking idiot.
- That's the idea.

699
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:59,877
Hey, hey, hey, hey. Everybody smile
and follow my lead, all right?

700
00:40:00,120 --> 00:40:02,998
I'm gonna take us to the promised land.
Here we go. Here we go.

701
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:06,473
Steady.

702
00:40:07,120 --> 00:40:09,190
- Steady.
- Shit.

703
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:17,277
Shh. Shh, shh. I got this one.

704
00:40:17,480 --> 00:40:22,634
Okay. Everybody just smile. Everybody
be cool. Here we go. Follow my lead. Ahem.

705
00:40:24,520 --> 00:40:26,909
You bringing anything
into the United States, sir?

706
00:40:27,120 --> 00:40:28,348
Yuh...

707
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:31,560
Sir, are you bringing any contraband
back into the United States?

708
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:32,795
Um...

709
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:34,228
- Sir?
- David!

710
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:41,513
Folks, I need you to pull over and exit the
vehicle, please.

711
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:44,835
- But...
- Sir, is that actually necessary?

712
00:40:45,080 --> 00:40:47,196
I mean, these kids
are pooped and we've just...

713
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:50,278
I need everybody out of this
recreational vehicle immediately.

714
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:53,119
- I'll just put the baby down.
- We'll put the baby away.

715
00:40:53,320 --> 00:40:58,394
Bring the child, pull over to the secondary
inspection area and exit the vehicle now!

716
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:00,953
- Okay.
- Good.

717
00:41:04,600 --> 00:41:05,828
It's okay. It's all right.

718
00:41:06,080 --> 00:41:07,911
It's okay, baby. It's just a puppy.

719
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:09,948
Stand down.

720
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:13,031
All right. It's okay.

721
00:41:14,040 --> 00:41:17,589
Before I search the vehicle, is there
anything you wanna tell me about?

722
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:19,358
Because after I open that door...

723
00:41:20,200 --> 00:41:21,428
...I can't help you.

724
00:41:27,240 --> 00:41:30,710
Last chance. I'm gonna search this vehicle
top to bottom.

725
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:32,475
All right.

726
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:36,669
We got runners!

727
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:43,672
We got runners!

728
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:47,153
Sorry to inconvenience you, folks.
This happens a lot.

729
00:41:47,360 --> 00:41:48,759
You have a nice day.

730
00:41:54,320 --> 00:41:56,436
Go. Go, go!

731
00:42:12,920 --> 00:42:14,956
Ah. Well, that was fucking easy!

732
00:42:16,520 --> 00:42:17,999
- Oh, my God.
- God!

733
00:42:18,200 --> 00:42:19,235
Whoo! We did it!

734
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:22,990
Nicely done, Millers! Give it up!
Very good job. Here you go.

735
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:25,794
Rose! Yeah! David! There you go!

736
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:30,471
We are all officially international drug
smugglers. Add it to the résumé.

737
00:42:30,680 --> 00:42:33,513
Ha, ha. How about a
little victory music, huh?

738
00:42:37,840 --> 00:42:38,909
Oh, no, no, no.

739
00:42:39,120 --> 00:42:41,395
- Don't change it. I love this song.
- Me too.

740
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:44,114
What? I didn't even like this song
when it was popular.

741
00:42:44,320 --> 00:42:45,719
Come on, loosen up, David.

742
00:42:48,200 --> 00:42:50,395
Please stick to the rivers

743
00:42:50,600 --> 00:42:52,750
And the lakes that you're used to

744
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:54,035
Don't do this.

745
00:42:54,240 --> 00:42:57,596
What? This isn't even
a good victory song.

746
00:42:57,840 --> 00:42:59,831
No, stop. We are not doing this.

747
00:43:00,040 --> 00:43:03,157
This is embarrassing. Stop.

748
00:43:04,440 --> 00:43:05,714
Ah, come on.

749
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:09,997
# I seen a rainbow yesterday But too
many storms have come and gone

750
00:43:10,200 --> 00:43:12,395
# Leavin' a trace of not one God-given ray
Is it because my life is 10 shades of gray

751
00:43:12,600 --> 00:43:13,635
What the fuck?

752
00:43:14,520 --> 00:43:17,592
# I pray all 10 fade away
Seldom praise him for the sunny days

753
00:43:17,800 --> 00:43:19,677
# You claim the insane
And name this place in time

754
00:43:19,880 --> 00:43:23,270
# For fallin ' prey to crime, I swear
The system got you victim to your own mind

755
00:43:23,480 --> 00:43:26,472
# Dreams are hopeless aspirations
In hopes of comin ' true

756
00:43:26,680 --> 00:43:28,716
# Believe in yourself
The rest is up to me and

757
00:43:28,920 --> 00:43:31,639
# Don't go chasin' waterfalls

758
00:43:31,840 --> 00:43:34,274
- Whoo!
- Whoo, yeah, Kenny!

759
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:36,038
Where did you learn to do that?

760
00:43:36,240 --> 00:43:37,673
Yeah, whatever.

761
00:44:01,800 --> 00:44:02,835
Señor Chacon.

762
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:06,518
We were not expecting you.

763
00:44:06,720 --> 00:44:10,633
I decided to bring the gringo myself
to make sure everything goes as planned.

764
00:44:10,840 --> 00:44:14,913
But the gringo has already left with the
shipment, señor.

765
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:16,269
What gringo?

766
00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:18,436
The gringo with the
haircut of a donkey.

767
00:44:19,360 --> 00:44:21,715
You mean this gringo
with the haircut of a donkey.

768
00:44:22,760 --> 00:44:23,988
I have failed you, señor.

769
00:44:24,200 --> 00:44:26,714
If you saw this gringo again
would you recognize him?

770
00:44:27,080 --> 00:44:29,913
He was driving an
RV with his family.

771
00:44:30,280 --> 00:44:31,679
Get in the car.

772
00:44:53,720 --> 00:44:55,676
Oh, how fast are you going?

773
00:44:56,640 --> 00:44:59,552
Calm down, I'm going the speed limit.
We won't get pulled over.

774
00:44:59,800 --> 00:45:03,588
No, no. I mean, loaded down like this
in a 15-ton vehicle...

775
00:45:03,840 --> 00:45:06,149
...going up a 10 percent grade.

776
00:45:06,760 --> 00:45:10,878
Just use your head, David.
I don't think you think things through.

777
00:45:11,080 --> 00:45:14,550
- What?
- Weight distribution loading and towing.

778
00:45:14,760 --> 00:45:15,909
- See?
- Yeah, I do.

779
00:45:16,120 --> 00:45:17,439
I thought this plan through.

780
00:45:17,640 --> 00:45:19,870
- Seems to be working out.
- Oh, great.

781
00:45:22,040 --> 00:45:23,473
Oh, shit!

782
00:45:25,760 --> 00:45:27,512
Seriously. God...!

783
00:45:35,120 --> 00:45:37,076
Was this part of your plan, David?

784
00:45:37,280 --> 00:45:38,349
Damn it.

785
00:45:38,760 --> 00:45:41,558
- Wait, what are we gonna do now?
- I don't kno...

786
00:45:41,800 --> 00:45:43,028
I can't even get a signal.

787
00:45:43,840 --> 00:45:46,479
No shit. We're in the fucking middle of
nowhere, dude.

788
00:45:46,720 --> 00:45:48,358
Oh, gee, thank you, Casey.

789
00:45:48,560 --> 00:45:51,154
Thank you for your amazing problem
solving skills. So helpful.

790
00:45:51,360 --> 00:45:52,634
Whoa. Hey, what are you doing?

791
00:45:52,840 --> 00:45:56,276
I'm not gonna stand on the side of the
road next to an RV filled with pot.

792
00:45:56,520 --> 00:45:57,794
I'm gonna try to find help.

793
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:01,151
- Yeah, fuck this. I'm going with her. Bye.
- What?

794
00:46:01,400 --> 00:46:03,994
- Wait up!
- Ugh. Ridiculous!

795
00:46:04,640 --> 00:46:08,235
Okay. Actually, that's fine. Good idea.
Okay, hurry back though, please.

796
00:46:08,440 --> 00:46:11,876
"Oh, I have a plan. " Really? Good plan.
You don't have any plans.

797
00:46:14,520 --> 00:46:15,794
Women, am I right?

798
00:46:16,880 --> 00:46:18,518
Shut the fuck up, Kenny.

799
00:46:20,760 --> 00:46:24,389
And he's so smug. Ugh.
He drives me crazy.

800
00:46:24,600 --> 00:46:25,919
Well, yeah, he's an idiot.

801
00:46:26,120 --> 00:46:28,475
No, he's not an idiot.
He's actually kind of smart.

802
00:46:28,720 --> 00:46:29,914
Why are you defending him?

803
00:46:30,120 --> 00:46:32,315
I'm not defending him.
I'm just saying that he...

804
00:46:32,520 --> 00:46:36,274
Have you seen where we are?
This whole plan is so stupid.

805
00:46:36,520 --> 00:46:37,635
Oh, really?

806
00:46:37,840 --> 00:46:41,116
What golden advice did you follow that
ended with you on the streets?

807
00:46:41,360 --> 00:46:44,636
I don't live on the streets, okay?
I crash with friends.

808
00:46:44,840 --> 00:46:46,910
Ah. Okay. I see.

809
00:46:47,120 --> 00:46:49,873
So you were kind of between couches
when David and Kenny found you.

810
00:46:50,080 --> 00:46:52,230
Are you gonna lecture me?
Seriously, I'll puke.

811
00:46:52,440 --> 00:46:54,158
You know what,
I'm not lecturing you.

812
00:46:54,360 --> 00:46:56,999
Okay, good. Because I don't
need advice from a stripper.

813
00:46:57,200 --> 00:46:58,758
All right, you know what you little shit?
I swear...

814
00:47:00,360 --> 00:47:01,759
What the hell is this?

815
00:47:03,160 --> 00:47:05,958
Well, look at this cute little
couple of hitchhikers.

816
00:47:06,160 --> 00:47:07,559
We're here to save your bacon.

817
00:47:07,800 --> 00:47:10,234
Saddle up, little ladies. Ha-ha-ha!

818
00:47:10,440 --> 00:47:12,431
Hey. Hi, what's going on?

819
00:47:12,680 --> 00:47:16,229
They pulled up right after you guys left.
They're gonna tow us to a mechanic.

820
00:47:16,440 --> 00:47:18,351
They keeping asking to hold
the weed baby.

821
00:47:18,600 --> 00:47:20,909
All right, all right, calm down. Okay.

822
00:47:21,120 --> 00:47:24,590
Just calm down, all right? I got this.
Watch.

823
00:47:25,600 --> 00:47:27,431
I'm holding that baby.

824
00:47:27,640 --> 00:47:30,757
Edie, you will, I promise,
but it's nap time for LeBron.

825
00:47:30,960 --> 00:47:32,029
Come on, guys, let's go.

826
00:47:32,280 --> 00:47:35,397
All aboard the Fitzgerald Express.
Honk, honk!

827
00:47:35,600 --> 00:47:38,068
- Ha-ha-ha!
- Toot, toot!

828
00:47:39,120 --> 00:47:41,554
It's like we're pretending it's a train,
but it's not.

829
00:47:49,040 --> 00:47:50,519
- Surrounded by goblins.
- Okay.

830
00:47:50,760 --> 00:47:51,954
Oh, oh, oh!

831
00:47:52,160 --> 00:47:54,754
One more sec, okay? Hold on,
one second. Don't freak.

832
00:47:54,960 --> 00:47:56,632
When you're a synchronized
swimmer...

833
00:47:56,840 --> 00:47:59,070
...you can't use a maxi pad,
you can see it.

834
00:47:59,280 --> 00:48:01,111
So my friend bought me
a box of tampins.

835
00:48:01,320 --> 00:48:03,834
And I'll tell you, I had
a hard time inserting those.

836
00:48:04,040 --> 00:48:06,110
- It would just stick halfway out.
- Mm-hm.

837
00:48:06,360 --> 00:48:08,112
- It was just like a Roman candle.
- Mm-hm.

838
00:48:08,440 --> 00:48:11,557
And that is how I found out
I was born with a shallow vagina.

839
00:48:13,360 --> 00:48:17,558
- That was such a detailed story, Edie.
- Thank you!

840
00:48:17,760 --> 00:48:22,436
You gotta do a one-woman show.
It's, like, so many layers, you know?

841
00:48:23,480 --> 00:48:25,675
So, what's your story, David?

842
00:48:25,920 --> 00:48:27,717
- What do you mean?
- How'd you two meet?

843
00:48:27,960 --> 00:48:30,474
Ah! Honey, tell her.

844
00:48:30,680 --> 00:48:33,240
And don't leave out
any of the romantic parts.

845
00:48:33,600 --> 00:48:34,919
Okay. All right.

846
00:48:35,120 --> 00:48:37,236
Where did we first meet. Um...

847
00:48:37,440 --> 00:48:38,793
It's great.

848
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:42,629
Well, that would have been when Rose
moved into my apartment building.

849
00:48:42,840 --> 00:48:44,671
- Ah. That's right.
- Mm-hm.

850
00:48:46,280 --> 00:48:49,431
I remember watching her through the
crack in my door as she was-

851
00:48:49,640 --> 00:48:50,914
Wait, you were spying on me?

852
00:48:51,120 --> 00:48:53,873
Now, hon, just because you've heard it
a thousand times...

853
00:48:54,080 --> 00:48:56,275
...doesn't mean you should interrupt.
Don't be rude.

854
00:48:56,840 --> 00:48:58,990
All right. Proceed.

855
00:48:59,840 --> 00:49:01,398
But, yeah, I was spying on her.

856
00:49:01,600 --> 00:49:03,955
She was unloading this U-Haul
all by herself.

857
00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:08,473
I wanna go help her, but I don't wanna
come off like I'm hitting on her, because...

858
00:49:09,080 --> 00:49:11,913
...you know, I'd like to hit on her
maybe at some point.

859
00:49:13,120 --> 00:49:15,270
And, uh...

860
00:49:15,480 --> 00:49:20,873
...she was wearing these little navy
blue Chuck Taylors and these jean shorts.

861
00:49:21,080 --> 00:49:23,594
No pockets on the back,
however that happened.

862
00:49:23,800 --> 00:49:27,031
And this, uh, Tom Waits T-shirt.

863
00:49:27,240 --> 00:49:28,958
I was like, "Oh, that's cool. "

864
00:49:29,160 --> 00:49:30,673
Because I love Tom Waits.

865
00:49:30,880 --> 00:49:32,791
And she just looked beautiful.

866
00:49:37,840 --> 00:49:39,990
If you're into that kind of mean,
pretty thing.

867
00:49:42,560 --> 00:49:43,595
So, anyway, uh...

868
00:49:43,800 --> 00:49:48,476
...she starts to bring up this really big
weird-looking painting up the stairs.

869
00:49:48,680 --> 00:49:52,514
And I'm like, "Okay, here's my shot. "
All right, so I go outside...

870
00:49:52,720 --> 00:49:56,030
...and I help her with it.
I'm trying to, at least.

871
00:49:56,240 --> 00:49:57,958
She looks at me and goes:
"Stop it!"

872
00:49:58,160 --> 00:50:00,515
- She just snaps at me.
- You started yanking at it.

873
00:50:00,760 --> 00:50:02,671
Next thing you know,
it's a tug of war...

874
00:50:02,880 --> 00:50:05,075
...pulling it back
and forth and out of nowhere...

875
00:50:05,280 --> 00:50:08,431
His fat fist
goes right through the canvas.

876
00:50:08,640 --> 00:50:11,791
- But it was an accident.
- Doesn't matter! You ruined my painting.

877
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:14,912
Okay. Honestly, I really think
you should've thanked me.

878
00:50:15,120 --> 00:50:17,190
Yeah, because that painting
was hideous.

879
00:50:18,760 --> 00:50:21,320
My grandfather painted that painting.

880
00:50:21,520 --> 00:50:24,318
And it was my favorite thing
in the entire world.

881
00:50:25,720 --> 00:50:28,678
So we get in this screaming
match in front of the whole building.

882
00:50:28,920 --> 00:50:31,195
And everybody comes out
and is watching it.

883
00:50:31,480 --> 00:50:33,596
I mean, from that moment,
we hated each other.

884
00:50:33,840 --> 00:50:35,273
Oh, man.

885
00:50:36,600 --> 00:50:40,354
- And then you fell in love. Oh!
- Yeah. Then we fell in love.

886
00:50:40,560 --> 00:50:44,599
- Ha, ha!
- Hey, now. I think this is our exit.

887
00:50:44,800 --> 00:50:47,268
David, could you grab me the map
out of the glove box?

888
00:50:47,800 --> 00:50:49,119
Yes, sir.

889
00:50:49,880 --> 00:50:52,599
- Whoa. Whoa. Uh...
- Whoa!

890
00:50:52,800 --> 00:50:55,758
Oh, hey, sorry about that, buddy.
Didn't mean to scare you there.

891
00:50:55,960 --> 00:50:57,791
That's just my service pistol and badge.

892
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:00,070
Oh. Your badge.

893
00:51:00,680 --> 00:51:03,114
- Are you a cop?
- No, no, no.

894
00:51:03,320 --> 00:51:04,958
No? Oh, God.

895
00:51:06,080 --> 00:51:07,274
- I'm in the DEA.
- Oh.

896
00:51:13,240 --> 00:51:16,118
Yeah, my Don has been an
agent for the last 22 years.

897
00:51:16,320 --> 00:51:17,992
On a bit of a hiatus at the moment.

898
00:51:18,200 --> 00:51:21,078
They took him out of the field,
he wasn't aggressive enough.

899
00:51:21,280 --> 00:51:23,475
- That's enough.
- I'm sorry. It's not right, Don.

900
00:51:23,720 --> 00:51:26,757
Those young guns aren't half the
agent you are, those crumb-bums.

901
00:51:26,960 --> 00:51:29,474
Edith, you know how I feel
about your cussing.

902
00:51:29,680 --> 00:51:32,877
- I'm sorry, Don. - Edith can be
a little hot-blooded at times.

903
00:51:33,080 --> 00:51:35,878
- I'm 1/8 Italian, so...
- Oh. It's okay.

904
00:51:37,040 --> 00:51:40,828
Uh, hey, if you guys will excuse me.

905
00:51:41,040 --> 00:51:42,837
- Wanna join me?
- Where are you off to?

906
00:51:43,040 --> 00:51:45,349
- We're gonna check on the baby.
- Gonna take a dump.

907
00:51:45,560 --> 00:51:47,915
- Check the baby's dumps.
- That's what we should say.

908
00:51:48,160 --> 00:51:51,197
- Yeah, just go check on Lebanon.
- LeBron. His name's LeBron.

909
00:51:51,400 --> 00:51:54,995
He just has a terrible tummy.
And it's just bad diarrhea stuff.

910
00:51:55,200 --> 00:51:56,519
Do we still have cornstarch?

911
00:51:56,720 --> 00:51:58,950
Yeah, there's cornstarch
for his bottom.

912
00:51:59,160 --> 00:52:00,832
- Family meeting.
- Yep.

913
00:52:01,840 --> 00:52:03,671
I'm getting my hands on that baby.

914
00:52:06,160 --> 00:52:08,310
He's a narc?
Are you fucking kidding me?!

915
00:52:08,680 --> 00:52:11,990
Stop panicking! We haven't done anything
suspicious yet, so just relax!

916
00:52:12,280 --> 00:52:15,636
Oh, really? Okay. What about when they
wanna hold our precious weed baby?

917
00:52:15,840 --> 00:52:17,159
Give me the baby, all right?

918
00:52:17,400 --> 00:52:19,709
I'll handle it if it happens.
I'll take care of it.

919
00:52:19,920 --> 00:52:23,469
Right now, all we have to do is
get away from that fucked up family.

920
00:52:23,840 --> 00:52:25,478
Oh, fuck. Why are we stopping?

921
00:52:25,680 --> 00:52:29,150
They heard us. They heard us.
Fuck, we're going to jail.

922
00:52:31,880 --> 00:52:34,030
No, no, no.
We're just at the garage, okay?

923
00:52:34,240 --> 00:52:37,198
Everybody calm down. We haven't
done anything. You're right.

924
00:52:37,400 --> 00:52:40,915
I'll ditch this guy real fast. We're gonna
get in and get out of here, okay?

925
00:52:41,120 --> 00:52:43,759
Game face, okay?
Miller time. Here we go.

926
00:52:45,080 --> 00:52:46,672
No other repair shops nearby?

927
00:52:46,880 --> 00:52:50,998
Run by a Christian and open after
supper on a Saturday night? No, sir.

928
00:52:51,280 --> 00:52:54,875
Ah, shoot. I'd give you the hose out
of our rig and send you on your way...

929
00:52:55,080 --> 00:52:56,752
...but we'd be stranded ourselves.

930
00:52:57,240 --> 00:53:00,152
Besides, this way we can all get to
know each other better.

931
00:53:00,440 --> 00:53:02,715
- What's happening?
- They're closed till morning.

932
00:53:03,120 --> 00:53:04,519
Oklahoma.

933
00:53:05,240 --> 00:53:06,275
Oh, God.

934
00:53:06,480 --> 00:53:09,074
You folks can make camp with the
Fitzgeralds tonight.

935
00:53:09,280 --> 00:53:13,319
I know a great spot. We'll set up the old
tents and you can bed down in our Winni.

936
00:53:13,520 --> 00:53:16,114
- I'll give you a hand with your gear.
- No, no, no.

937
00:53:16,320 --> 00:53:18,356
That's okay.
Millers carry their own weight.

938
00:53:18,640 --> 00:53:21,552
- I knew I liked you, David.
- Kenny, you wanna get our shit?

939
00:53:22,360 --> 00:53:24,590
- Hey.
- This will be a hoot.

940
00:53:25,080 --> 00:53:28,277
I'll watch your little one so you and your
man can have some snuggle time.

941
00:53:28,480 --> 00:53:30,948
- I don't want you to have to...
- I am good with babies.

942
00:53:31,160 --> 00:53:33,549
Nonsense! Oh, give me the baby.
Give me that baby!

943
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:46,035
Shit!

944
00:53:47,480 --> 00:53:48,515
Oh, my God!

945
00:53:49,720 --> 00:53:51,756
Oh, my God!

946
00:53:52,440 --> 00:53:55,637
Oh, my God.
Why isn't there blood?!

947
00:53:55,840 --> 00:53:58,718
Oh, my God! What's happening?

948
00:53:58,960 --> 00:54:02,919
Thanks a lot, Mom. Now what am I
supposed to use for my health project?

949
00:54:03,120 --> 00:54:05,350
I'm gonna fail and have to go to
community college.

950
00:54:05,560 --> 00:54:08,120
- My future's ruined!
- Honey.

951
00:54:08,480 --> 00:54:10,311
Mrs. Fitzgerald, are you all right?

952
00:54:10,520 --> 00:54:13,830
- That baby was...?
- Oh, did you think that LeBron was...?

953
00:54:14,040 --> 00:54:17,874
- Heh-heh-heh.
- No, no, no. LeBron was a sack of herbs.

954
00:54:18,080 --> 00:54:19,672
Oregano and basil mostly.

955
00:54:19,880 --> 00:54:22,599
We were just treating it like
a real baby, a summer project.

956
00:54:22,800 --> 00:54:25,109
- Extra credit.
- It teaches the students that...

957
00:54:25,360 --> 00:54:26,952
...nothing ruins your life like children.

958
00:54:27,680 --> 00:54:31,150
Yeah. And it also sends that message
to teens, just stick to the big A.

959
00:54:31,360 --> 00:54:33,157
- Yeah, anal.
- Abstinence, you meant.

960
00:54:34,400 --> 00:54:36,231
- Neither makes a baby.
- He confuses them.

961
00:54:37,040 --> 00:54:39,838
Anyway, I'm so sorry, Edie.
We promised our Casey...

962
00:54:40,080 --> 00:54:43,629
...that we would treat it like a real baby
all summer and we went too far.

963
00:54:43,880 --> 00:54:44,915
Got used to it. Sorry.

964
00:54:45,120 --> 00:54:46,633
And so I'm embarrassed, actually.

965
00:54:46,880 --> 00:54:48,518
I think that would scare anybody.

966
00:54:48,760 --> 00:54:52,036
She's very emotional. You should have
seen her at the end of Free Willy.

967
00:54:52,240 --> 00:54:53,434
Oh, stop it, Don.

968
00:54:55,880 --> 00:54:57,279
I love that whale.

969
00:54:57,680 --> 00:55:00,114
Well, who loves campfire games?

970
00:55:00,280 --> 00:55:02,111
Oh, Don.

971
00:55:04,840 --> 00:55:07,070
Ladies and gentlemen,
it's my pleasure to welcome you...

972
00:55:07,280 --> 00:55:10,397
...to the annual singing
Fitzgerald family jamboree.

973
00:55:11,400 --> 00:55:13,356
Our usual guests couldn't
be here this year.

974
00:55:13,760 --> 00:55:17,196
- Uh, they're called the Osmond family.
- Ha-ha-ha!

975
00:55:19,800 --> 00:55:25,193
But in their place this year we have the
very talented and wonderful Miller family.

976
00:55:26,240 --> 00:55:29,789
Let's get this party started
with a Fitzgerald family favorite.

977
00:55:30,400 --> 00:55:33,233
# Breakin' rocks in the hot sun

978
00:55:33,734 --> 00:55:36,668
# I fought the law
and the law won

979
00:55:36,978 --> 00:55:39,693
# I fought the law
and the law won

980
00:55:39,920 --> 00:55:41,239
It always does.

981
00:55:41,440 --> 00:55:44,716
I needed to steal some money
'Cause I had none

982
00:55:44,880 --> 00:55:47,155
I fought the law and the law won

983
00:55:47,360 --> 00:55:48,395
Now just the Millers.

984
00:55:48,560 --> 00:55:52,030
I fought the law and the law won

985
00:55:52,240 --> 00:55:55,710
I fought the law and the law won

986
00:55:56,680 --> 00:55:59,175
I want you to imagine
you committed a felony,

987
00:55:59,551 --> 00:56:02,510
you've been tried and sent to prison...
... and you're standing out in the sun

988
00:56:02,907 --> 00:56:04,903
breaking up rocks with
a sledgehammer. And...

989
00:56:04,938 --> 00:56:07,632
# I fought the law
and the law won

990
00:56:07,840 --> 00:56:10,638
# I fought the law
and the law won

991
00:56:10,840 --> 00:56:12,512
- All right, that's great.
- That's good.

992
00:56:12,720 --> 00:56:15,154
- That's fun. Great song.
- I love it. That was great.

993
00:56:15,320 --> 00:56:16,878
Great choice.

994
00:56:17,040 --> 00:56:20,350
- Great, kids.
- Well, that was an A for effort.

995
00:56:20,560 --> 00:56:23,154
- Whoo! I got the spirit!
- That's great.

996
00:56:23,320 --> 00:56:24,548
It's a bird, it's a plane.

997
00:56:24,720 --> 00:56:27,712
- U.S. Air Force, U.S. Air Force.
Ollie North! - Take me home to...

998
00:56:27,880 --> 00:56:29,279
Looks like a sea animal.

999
00:56:29,720 --> 00:56:30,835
Hammer tooth shark.

1000
00:56:31,040 --> 00:56:35,591
We wait until they fall asleep and then
we sneak into their tent, all right?

1001
00:56:35,800 --> 00:56:37,711
Mm. Cut their throats.

1002
00:56:38,480 --> 00:56:40,357
- What?
- What?

1003
00:56:40,560 --> 00:56:42,357
No. Jesus.

1004
00:56:42,680 --> 00:56:44,557
- What the fuck's wrong with you?
- Nothing.

1005
00:56:44,760 --> 00:56:48,230
I wasn't saying to do that. I didn't
say that. I thought you were gonna it.

1006
00:56:48,440 --> 00:56:50,829
You thought I was gonna say
"cut their throats"?

1007
00:56:51,280 --> 00:56:53,669
Who do you think I am, Scarface?
Give me a break.

1008
00:56:53,880 --> 00:56:55,711
- Herbert Walker Bush!
- Paper airplanes!

1009
00:56:56,320 --> 00:56:57,639
Clowns. Clown sandwich.

1010
00:56:57,840 --> 00:56:59,432
Don't lock the baby in the basement.

1011
00:56:59,680 --> 00:57:02,717
What I was gonna say: We sneak
into the tent, steal Don's keys...

1012
00:57:02,920 --> 00:57:06,674
...then we take the RV back to the shop and
I can swap out their radiator hose for ours.

1013
00:57:06,880 --> 00:57:08,916
Ah. Got it.

1014
00:57:09,120 --> 00:57:11,873
- The Earth! The Earth is on fire!
- Atmosphere.

1015
00:57:12,080 --> 00:57:13,354
Uh...

1016
00:57:13,560 --> 00:57:14,675
Plain and simple.

1017
00:57:14,880 --> 00:57:16,472
Al Qaeda! Al Qaeda!

1018
00:57:18,400 --> 00:57:19,628
It was "plain and simple. "

1019
00:57:19,840 --> 00:57:25,119
- See, this was a plane, and then this w-
- Oh, Melissa, of course it was.

1020
00:57:25,480 --> 00:57:26,708
That is so clever.

1021
00:57:26,960 --> 00:57:28,678
Gosh, I thought it was really good.

1022
00:57:29,400 --> 00:57:31,231
I'm a terrible drawer, so...

1023
00:57:32,440 --> 00:57:34,317
- Great, because you're up next.
- Ah.

1024
00:57:36,280 --> 00:57:38,396
- Passing the baton.
- Nice work.

1025
00:57:38,640 --> 00:57:40,392
Okay. Let's go, Kenny.

1026
00:57:40,640 --> 00:57:42,358
All right, Kenny, here we go.

1027
00:57:42,600 --> 00:57:44,875
- Draw your brains out.
- All right, that's a line.

1028
00:57:45,080 --> 00:57:47,230
- A slash. Guns and Roses.
- Looks like a spring.

1029
00:57:47,480 --> 00:57:50,517
What is that? That's a- Kenny,
come on, draw something, buddy.

1030
00:57:50,720 --> 00:57:51,835
- String.
- Come on, son.

1031
00:57:52,040 --> 00:57:54,554
- Rocket. It's a rocket or...
- Is that a cucumber?

1032
00:57:54,760 --> 00:57:56,034
This is really stupid.

1033
00:57:56,280 --> 00:57:58,874
Is it a bad drawing, Kenny?
My guess is "bad drawing. "

1034
00:57:59,400 --> 00:58:02,631
- It's...
- Oh! A penis! A penis.

1035
00:58:03,200 --> 00:58:06,237
It's a big dick. Those are balls.

1036
00:58:06,440 --> 00:58:09,637
It's a big black dick! It's a drawing.
Black! It's a big black dick.

1037
00:58:10,600 --> 00:58:12,875
It's a big, big black cock!

1038
00:58:13,640 --> 00:58:14,789
Black Cock Down!

1039
00:58:19,960 --> 00:58:21,188
It's a skateboard.

1040
00:58:21,480 --> 00:58:24,233
- It's a skateboard, great.
- A skateboard. Of course it is.

1041
00:58:24,440 --> 00:58:27,352
- It's a big black skateboard.
- I see it.

1042
00:58:27,600 --> 00:58:30,592
Of course. It's very clear.
But, you see, it was up... There's...

1043
00:58:30,800 --> 00:58:34,031
Its wheels, so I didn't see it
down on the ground, and then it...

1044
00:58:37,920 --> 00:58:40,639
Black Cock Down?
Black Cock Down?

1045
00:58:40,840 --> 00:58:43,479
Nice job, Meryl Streep.
Very subtle character work.

1046
00:58:43,680 --> 00:58:45,671
Not my fault that Kenny can't draw.

1047
00:58:45,880 --> 00:58:47,552
Don't you pick on Kenny.

1048
00:58:47,760 --> 00:58:50,149
Nothing about that looked
like a skateboard.

1049
00:58:50,360 --> 00:58:53,193
You leave him alone.
Where the hell's Kenny?

1050
00:58:53,400 --> 00:58:55,470
- You guys, come here.
- What?

1051
00:58:55,680 --> 00:58:57,352
- What's going on?
- Look at these two.

1052
00:58:57,560 --> 00:58:59,391
- Aww.
- Uh-oh.

1053
00:59:02,160 --> 00:59:04,799
- Guess I'm not the best drawer.
- No, you were great.

1054
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:07,036
- I knew that was a skateboard.
- Yeah.

1055
00:59:07,400 --> 00:59:10,312
- I don't know where the confusion was.
- No, I... That...

1056
00:59:10,640 --> 00:59:12,119
Yeah.

1057
00:59:13,040 --> 00:59:16,077
I, um, really like your family.
They're, uh...

1058
00:59:16,320 --> 00:59:19,869
- They're different.
- Well, they're not my family. I mean...

1059
00:59:20,080 --> 00:59:21,559
Yeah, no, I get what you mean.

1060
00:59:21,760 --> 00:59:23,671
- She wants him to kiss her.
- Absolutely.

1061
00:59:23,880 --> 00:59:27,190
- She does, right?
- And sometimes I feel like I'm adopted...

1062
00:59:27,400 --> 00:59:29,516
...or an alien, you know,
or something.

1063
00:59:29,720 --> 00:59:32,632
Right. That's what I meant. Um...

1064
00:59:32,880 --> 00:59:35,394
But also, you know, I
would totally adopt you.

1065
00:59:35,920 --> 00:59:37,114
You know, um...

1066
00:59:38,640 --> 00:59:41,916
Not that I wanna be your daddy.
I just, uh...

1067
00:59:42,400 --> 00:59:44,595
- He's talking too much.
- He won't shut up.

1068
00:59:47,040 --> 00:59:48,314
Uh, well, good night.

1069
00:59:50,560 --> 00:59:52,312
- I'll see you.
- Okay. Um...

1070
00:59:52,800 --> 00:59:53,949
Fucking hug.

1071
00:59:54,160 --> 00:59:55,229
Okay.

1072
00:59:56,680 --> 00:59:57,715
And, uh, Melissa?

1073
00:59:58,600 --> 01:00:01,592
- Yeah?
- Uh, watch out for bears.

1074
01:00:01,800 --> 01:00:05,395
Um, you know.
Can't see them coming.

1075
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:07,274
Good tip.

1076
01:00:13,880 --> 01:00:16,838
That poor kid.
Well, you should go talk to him.

1077
01:00:17,280 --> 01:00:18,474
Who?

1078
01:00:19,480 --> 01:00:21,277
I said you should go...
Well, who do you think?

1079
01:00:21,480 --> 01:00:23,391
Me? What the hell am I gonna say?

1080
01:00:23,600 --> 01:00:25,318
Talk to him about guy stuff.

1081
01:00:25,880 --> 01:00:28,917
- Jesus fucking Christ.
- Come on, how hard is it? Just go.

1082
01:00:34,280 --> 01:00:37,158
- Hey, man, how you doing?
- Hey.

1083
01:00:37,400 --> 01:00:39,391
- Anybody sitting here?
- Uh, no.

1084
01:00:39,600 --> 01:00:42,637
Well, good, good, good, good.
All right.

1085
01:00:44,080 --> 01:00:45,479
So, um...

1086
01:00:46,520 --> 01:00:49,512
...I saw what just happened
with you and Melissa.

1087
01:00:50,240 --> 01:00:51,912
- Oh.
- Um...

1088
01:00:52,160 --> 01:00:56,790
You know, you don't have to be scared to
kiss a girl. Heh-heh.

1089
01:00:57,040 --> 01:01:01,318
I mean, you damn near sucked a guy's dick
nine hours ago. What are you shy now for?

1090
01:01:02,040 --> 01:01:03,632
That's not funny, David.

1091
01:01:06,320 --> 01:01:09,118
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1092
01:01:09,920 --> 01:01:12,036
It was a bad joke. Ahem.

1093
01:01:14,320 --> 01:01:17,073
You wanna know something I used
to do when I was your age...

1094
01:01:17,280 --> 01:01:19,475
...kept me from
getting nervous around girls?

1095
01:01:20,200 --> 01:01:23,431
- Yeah.
- I would just count to three.

1096
01:01:24,360 --> 01:01:26,271
- Count to three?
- Yeah.

1097
01:01:26,840 --> 01:01:29,559
- That's your big advice? Count to three?
- Yeah.

1098
01:01:29,760 --> 01:01:33,958
I mean, if you ever wanna kiss a girl
or ask her to go out, or I mean...

1099
01:01:34,160 --> 01:01:37,675
Actually, if you get scared of anything,
just do this: just count to three...

1100
01:01:37,920 --> 01:01:39,239
...and then do it.

1101
01:01:40,200 --> 01:01:44,751
Because if you take too long, you overthink
it and you'll just drive yourself crazy.

1102
01:01:44,960 --> 01:01:46,791
Trust me, it'll change your life.

1103
01:01:48,160 --> 01:01:49,912
I guess that makes sense.

1104
01:01:51,160 --> 01:01:53,515
- Thanks.
- Yeah. No problem.

1105
01:01:53,720 --> 01:01:57,110
And, you know, if you have any other
questions...

1106
01:01:57,320 --> 01:01:59,276
...about, like, the birds and the bees...

1107
01:01:59,520 --> 01:02:02,159
...who puts what into where,
any of that fun stuff...

1108
01:02:02,400 --> 01:02:04,994
...just don't hesitate to ask, okay?

1109
01:02:05,240 --> 01:02:06,275
- Okay.
- Okay.

1110
01:02:06,560 --> 01:02:07,913
- Good talk.
- Yeah, good talk.

1111
01:02:08,160 --> 01:02:09,991
Oh, my back.

1112
01:02:10,560 --> 01:02:12,915
- So old.
- Yeah.

1113
01:02:35,400 --> 01:02:39,871
Wait. You go in.
I'll keep a lookout, okay? Good.

1114
01:02:40,080 --> 01:02:43,709
Fuck you. This was your idea.
You're going the fuck in there.

1115
01:02:43,920 --> 01:02:45,558
Why are you yelling at me?

1116
01:02:45,760 --> 01:02:47,796
I am not yelling at you.

1117
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:50,434
Okay. Okay.

1118
01:02:52,320 --> 01:02:53,548
Watch.

1119
01:03:09,120 --> 01:03:10,519
Bin Laden!

1120
01:03:11,680 --> 01:03:13,193
What's happening? Is it raccoons?

1121
01:03:14,480 --> 01:03:15,629
God.

1122
01:03:16,120 --> 01:03:17,678
You were right about them, Edith.

1123
01:03:17,880 --> 01:03:19,632
- No. I'm so sorry.
- Let me explain.

1124
01:03:19,840 --> 01:03:21,239
This is completely explainable.

1125
01:03:21,480 --> 01:03:23,710
- A misunderstanding.
- We didn't mean to do this.

1126
01:03:25,400 --> 01:03:27,709
- You just have to understand something.
- Mm-hm, mm-hm.

1127
01:03:30,040 --> 01:03:33,430
We have never done anything like this with
another couple before.

1128
01:03:34,240 --> 01:03:35,639
Uh-huh.

1129
01:03:35,840 --> 01:03:38,434
That's no judgment on you.
We're no squares.

1130
01:03:38,640 --> 01:03:40,790
- I own a vibrator.
- That's right, she does.

1131
01:03:41,680 --> 01:03:43,272
- Awesome.
- I wasn't for it at first.

1132
01:03:43,480 --> 01:03:46,438
The darn thing's made in China,
for cripes' sake...

1133
01:03:46,640 --> 01:03:51,350
...but when you've been married this long
you look for anything to spice things up.

1134
01:03:51,560 --> 01:03:55,394
So, of course we've discussed a scenario
like this.

1135
01:03:55,640 --> 01:03:59,713
Yes. And tonight when you brought up
that big black "babymaker"...

1136
01:04:00,720 --> 01:04:02,836
- Well, we got it.
- Loud and clear.

1137
01:04:03,040 --> 01:04:05,349
Our vibrator is named "Joe Morgan. "

1138
01:04:05,880 --> 01:04:08,713
We were picking up
what you were putting down.

1139
01:04:09,080 --> 01:04:11,036
- Same page.
- Interesting.

1140
01:04:11,280 --> 01:04:15,319
We're very flattered by this, but right now,
in the middle of the night...

1141
01:04:15,520 --> 01:04:18,910
...I'm not sure I'm really ready for it.
Aw, Don.

1142
01:04:19,160 --> 01:04:21,435
Got it. Totally understood. Not a problem.

1143
01:04:21,640 --> 01:04:22,993
We just had to ask. So...

1144
01:04:23,200 --> 01:04:24,474
Wait. I have an idea.

1145
01:04:26,320 --> 01:04:30,996
Okay. Maybe I could take
a baby step tonight.

1146
01:04:31,200 --> 01:04:33,760
I mean, my mouth is for my marriage.

1147
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:36,912
But I've never touched
another woman before.

1148
01:04:40,040 --> 01:04:43,316
I would be okay with that. Yeah.

1149
01:04:44,040 --> 01:04:45,075
Oh, great.

1150
01:04:45,960 --> 01:04:47,188
Rose?

1151
01:04:48,200 --> 01:04:50,475
- There you go.
- Okay. All right, I'm sitting.

1152
01:04:50,760 --> 01:04:52,159
- Are you okay?
- David.

1153
01:04:52,400 --> 01:04:55,358
- Mother to mother, is this okay with you?
- Yes. "Mother. " Yes.

1154
01:04:55,560 --> 01:04:57,869
- Are you sure?
- Let's get this mother started.

1155
01:04:58,120 --> 01:05:00,509
- Shall we? Okay.
- Ha-ha-ha!

1156
01:05:00,760 --> 01:05:03,752
- Okay, Don, are you watching?
- I'm good.

1157
01:05:04,720 --> 01:05:06,551
Okay. Uh, wow.

1158
01:05:06,760 --> 01:05:09,399
My heart's pounding
so fast in my chest.

1159
01:05:09,600 --> 01:05:12,239
- Ahem. So I guess we're swinging.
- Hmm? Oh, yeah.

1160
01:05:12,440 --> 01:05:14,271
Ooh. Ha, ha.

1161
01:05:14,480 --> 01:05:15,913
Sorry that I'm taking so long.

1162
01:05:16,120 --> 01:05:18,190
Hello. Ha-ha-ha!

1163
01:05:19,840 --> 01:05:22,877
Okay, I'm just gonna do it real fast.
There we go.

1164
01:05:23,600 --> 01:05:24,999
- There they are.
- There they are.

1165
01:05:25,200 --> 01:05:28,476
- Wow! Wow!
- It's happening. This is happening.

1166
01:05:29,480 --> 01:05:32,552
Don, are you looking at this?
I'm touching her boobs.

1167
01:05:32,960 --> 01:05:34,996
- This is a miracle.
- Okey-doke.

1168
01:05:35,240 --> 01:05:38,471
- Would you like to feel my breasts?
- I think that's enough for tonight.

1169
01:05:38,680 --> 01:05:40,477
- You're right.
- Don't give away the farm.

1170
01:05:40,680 --> 01:05:42,432
- A little roughhouse?
- We should wait.

1171
01:05:43,280 --> 01:05:45,396
- Are you okay down there?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1172
01:05:45,600 --> 01:05:46,999
Have fun tonight, kids.

1173
01:05:48,360 --> 01:05:52,273
- Awesome.
- I'm never gonna wash these hands.

1174
01:05:52,480 --> 01:05:53,833
Mwah, mwah, mwah!

1175
01:05:54,400 --> 01:05:55,628
Thank you so much.

1176
01:05:56,040 --> 01:05:58,031
- Good night. That was great.
- Okay, bye, guys.

1177
01:05:58,200 --> 01:06:00,191
Great. What now, genius?

1178
01:06:00,360 --> 01:06:02,396
- Tell me- What?
- Oh, oh, oh. I don't know.

1179
01:06:02,600 --> 01:06:04,079
I just got earfucked in a tent.

1180
01:06:04,240 --> 01:06:07,038
If you let her finger bang you
they would have given us the keys.

1181
01:06:07,200 --> 01:06:09,953
Oh, really? Why don't you go
suck Don's dick for them...

1182
01:06:10,120 --> 01:06:13,317
...and then you get the keys?
He was certainly loving on those earlobes.

1183
01:06:13,480 --> 01:06:16,870
Okay, look. First, unlike you, I only
suck a man's dick if I'm in love, okay?

1184
01:06:17,040 --> 01:06:18,712
That's kind of a personal rule I have.

1185
01:06:18,880 --> 01:06:21,155
- Yeah, and secondly... And secondly...
- What?

1186
01:06:24,160 --> 01:06:27,277
I don't have a second one.
I don't know where I was going with that.

1187
01:06:27,440 --> 01:06:29,317
Fucking idiot.

1188
01:06:29,960 --> 01:06:31,871
Oh, I thought of one. I got one.

1189
01:06:35,920 --> 01:06:38,036
Here comes Joe Morgan
up to the plate.

1190
01:06:39,480 --> 01:06:40,799
Oh, Don.

1191
01:06:46,400 --> 01:06:47,469
Okay, what?

1192
01:06:49,560 --> 01:06:50,879
What? What do you mean?

1193
01:06:51,080 --> 01:06:52,433
Do you wanna talk about it...

1194
01:06:52,640 --> 01:06:55,393
...or mope around like
someone kicked you in the vagina?

1195
01:06:57,400 --> 01:06:59,311
Okay. Um...

1196
01:06:59,520 --> 01:07:01,556
Well, I've never really like...

1197
01:07:01,760 --> 01:07:03,910
Had sex before. Shocker.

1198
01:07:04,160 --> 01:07:05,639
Kissed a girl before.

1199
01:07:06,240 --> 01:07:09,596
Wait, what? I thought you said
you were like 18.

1200
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:12,389
- Okay, you know what, forget it.
- Okay, okay, wait. Okay.

1201
01:07:12,600 --> 01:07:15,592
Come on. Sit down.
Don't need to be so dramatic.

1202
01:07:15,840 --> 01:07:18,400
Look, it's okay
that you haven't kissed a girl.

1203
01:07:18,600 --> 01:07:20,795
I'm sure there are some girls...

1204
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:22,752
...who I've never met...

1205
01:07:23,200 --> 01:07:25,555
...that find inexperience
kind of sweet.

1206
01:07:25,760 --> 01:07:30,151
I don't wanna be a sweet, inexperienced
guy who's never been worth kissing.

1207
01:07:30,960 --> 01:07:35,636
I wanna be the guy who grabs a girl
and kisses her. You know?

1208
01:07:38,760 --> 01:07:41,433
Okay, let me make one thing clear.

1209
01:07:41,640 --> 01:07:44,677
This isn't one of those moments
where the girl kisses the boy...

1210
01:07:44,880 --> 01:07:47,872
...and realizes she's been in love with him
the whole time, okay?

1211
01:07:48,720 --> 01:07:50,836
You're my fake brother
and you're a sweet kid...

1212
01:07:51,080 --> 01:07:53,548
...so this is for you
to bring back to Melissa.

1213
01:07:53,760 --> 01:07:55,876
- What is?
- I'm gonna kiss you, dingus.

1214
01:07:56,720 --> 01:07:58,233
Oh.

1215
01:07:59,840 --> 01:08:02,479
- What are you doing? Shut your eyes.
- Okay, sorry. Right.

1216
01:08:02,720 --> 01:08:04,915
That's weird. That's really weird.

1217
01:08:05,120 --> 01:08:07,156
- Sorry.
- All right. Ahem.

1218
01:08:12,800 --> 01:08:14,950
That was okay.
Now more tongue.

1219
01:08:15,160 --> 01:08:17,390
Tongue. I can do that.

1220
01:08:20,080 --> 01:08:22,275
Too much tongue. Too much tongue.

1221
01:08:22,720 --> 01:08:26,076
Right. Too much-
Yeah, that's my fault. My bad. Sorry.

1222
01:08:28,120 --> 01:08:29,189
Less tongue.

1223
01:08:34,720 --> 01:08:35,755
That was good.

1224
01:08:36,960 --> 01:08:39,872
All right, now this time, I want you
to choke me a little bit.

1225
01:08:40,080 --> 01:08:44,039
- Uh, okay.
- Whoa. What's going on here?

1226
01:08:44,240 --> 01:08:45,719
Uh, it's...

1227
01:08:45,920 --> 01:08:48,832
- We're not doing what it looks like.
- Really?

1228
01:08:49,080 --> 01:08:51,719
It looks like Casey's teaching
you how to kiss out of pity.

1229
01:08:51,920 --> 01:08:53,069
Mm-hm.

1230
01:08:53,280 --> 01:08:55,840
Uh, well, then it is what
it looks like, yeah.

1231
01:08:56,200 --> 01:08:57,474
Really.

1232
01:08:57,840 --> 01:08:59,273
What did you teach him?

1233
01:08:59,480 --> 01:09:02,392
The basics.
He's never kissed a girl before.

1234
01:09:02,880 --> 01:09:05,519
You haven't?
Oh. Well, honey, show me.

1235
01:09:05,720 --> 01:09:07,870
- Uh, really?
- Yes.

1236
01:09:08,480 --> 01:09:09,595
Okay. Uh...

1237
01:09:12,240 --> 01:09:14,435
Oh. Not bad.

1238
01:09:14,640 --> 01:09:15,993
It's not bad.

1239
01:09:16,480 --> 01:09:18,152
- Try this.
- Okay.

1240
01:09:18,360 --> 01:09:19,429
Come here.

1241
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:24,035
There you go.

1242
01:09:26,280 --> 01:09:28,191
You feel that?
What I did with my tongue?

1243
01:09:28,960 --> 01:09:32,157
- Yes, ma'am.
- Show Casey what you just learned.

1244
01:09:35,840 --> 01:09:37,398
Look at that.

1245
01:09:38,280 --> 01:09:40,669
Mm! Whoa!

1246
01:09:40,880 --> 01:09:42,108
Wait. Hold on.

1247
01:09:42,360 --> 01:09:46,239
I wanna get a picture of you with
the first girl you ever kissed. Here you go.

1248
01:09:46,440 --> 01:09:47,953
- Mm-hm. Make it good.
- Good.

1249
01:09:48,200 --> 01:09:51,078
Rose. Get in there.
There you go. Photobomb it.

1250
01:09:52,160 --> 01:09:54,594
- This is getting better, it's
getting better. - Okay.

1251
01:09:58,600 --> 01:10:00,113
It's so cute.

1252
01:10:00,320 --> 01:10:02,436
Use your hands. They got so
much fun stuff to play with.

1253
01:10:02,640 --> 01:10:04,278
You're not using your hands.

1254
01:10:09,160 --> 01:10:10,718
Kenny?

1255
01:10:13,040 --> 01:10:15,270
- No, Melissa... It's, uh...
- I'm sorry.

1256
01:10:15,520 --> 01:10:16,999
Melissa, wait.

1257
01:10:18,080 --> 01:10:19,195
Fuck.

1258
01:10:20,480 --> 01:10:23,313
You know, there's a 50-50 chance
she'll be into it.

1259
01:10:23,520 --> 01:10:25,431
Redhead. They're crazy.

1260
01:10:34,880 --> 01:10:37,553
Grab your things, guys.
Kenny, grab my stuff. Thanks.

1261
01:10:37,720 --> 01:10:40,154
- Here we go.
- Well, looks like you're ready to roll.

1262
01:10:40,320 --> 01:10:43,995
Gary called me first thing. He seemed real
eager for y'all to come pick her up.

1263
01:10:44,160 --> 01:10:46,833
- Good. Good, good, good. Okay.
- Guess this is it, then.

1264
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:49,753
- Good luck to you, David.
- Hey, thank you, Don. Take care, will you?

1265
01:10:49,920 --> 01:10:53,469
Hey, yeah, listen, I would appreciate it
if you kept what happened last night...

1266
01:10:53,680 --> 01:10:55,955
...all that Chinese vibrator talk,
between us.

1267
01:10:56,120 --> 01:10:59,157
- Yeah. - If folks at my church
found out about that...

1268
01:10:59,320 --> 01:11:02,915
Yeah. Oh, yeah. No, no. I get it. Yeah.
No, say no more. Mum's the word, okay?

1269
01:11:03,080 --> 01:11:04,149
Before you go running off...

1270
01:11:04,360 --> 01:11:06,669
- Yeah?
- Well, last night notwithstanding...

1271
01:11:06,840 --> 01:11:09,718
...things bedroom-wise between me
and Mrs. Fitzgerald...

1272
01:11:09,880 --> 01:11:12,952
- ... haven't been a real five-alarm
fire of late. - Okay.

1273
01:11:13,160 --> 01:11:16,596
Now that I'm not working as much,
we have a chance to light the flame again...

1274
01:11:16,760 --> 01:11:19,672
- ... but our matches are wet.
- Mm-hm. Mm-hm.

1275
01:11:19,840 --> 01:11:23,071
- If you catch my drift.
- I do, yeah.

1276
01:11:23,240 --> 01:11:25,071
Yeah, the matches are genitals. I get it.

1277
01:11:25,240 --> 01:11:28,038
No, I was talking about our passion.

1278
01:11:28,200 --> 01:11:30,270
Right. Sorry, sorry. Of course.
That's the way-

1279
01:11:30,440 --> 01:11:32,078
- That's okay. That's all right.
- Yeah.

1280
01:11:32,240 --> 01:11:33,912
So we've been looking
for new ideas...

1281
01:11:34,080 --> 01:11:37,072
...and she read on the internet
about this finger thing...

1282
01:11:37,240 --> 01:11:40,471
- Don, you don't need to share that with me.
- No, no, it's okay. I want to.

1283
01:11:40,640 --> 01:11:42,198
Okay, as long as you're comfortable.

1284
01:11:42,400 --> 01:11:43,913
- I need your advice, David.
- Mm-hm.

1285
01:11:44,240 --> 01:11:47,038
You and Rose seem hotter for each other
than a couple mice...

1286
01:11:47,200 --> 01:11:49,270
...having sexual congress in a wool sock.

1287
01:11:49,920 --> 01:11:51,353
- We do?
- Yeah.

1288
01:11:51,520 --> 01:11:54,318
You're like newlyweds,
the way you keep looking at each other.

1289
01:11:54,920 --> 01:11:57,388
- We are?
- Yeah. I guess I just wanna know...

1290
01:11:57,560 --> 01:12:02,509
...what do you do to keep things exciting
after years in the same fishing hole?

1291
01:12:02,680 --> 01:12:04,830
- Hmm.
- What's your secret?

1292
01:12:05,200 --> 01:12:06,394
Right.

1293
01:12:06,560 --> 01:12:08,630
- And by fishing hole you mean...
- Genitals.

1294
01:12:08,840 --> 01:12:10,068
That's genitals. Okay. Um.

1295
01:12:10,240 --> 01:12:13,357
Yeah, um, my secret? Uh...

1296
01:12:14,280 --> 01:12:16,316
Well, you know what I do, Don?

1297
01:12:16,680 --> 01:12:19,114
I just treat
Rose like she's a stripper.

1298
01:12:22,560 --> 01:12:24,039
- No kidding?
- No kidding.

1299
01:12:24,200 --> 01:12:26,350
Like she's a dirty, dirty stripper.

1300
01:12:28,520 --> 01:12:30,112
Okay. Heh-heh-heh.

1301
01:12:30,320 --> 01:12:31,753
Dirtier the better. Heh.

1302
01:12:31,920 --> 01:12:34,070
- Heh, heh.
- Okay, watch your step.

1303
01:12:34,480 --> 01:12:37,119
It surprise- It sneaks up on you.

1304
01:12:37,520 --> 01:12:38,714
Everyone got your bags?

1305
01:12:39,240 --> 01:12:42,835
Oh. I am so sorry that Melissa
isn't here to say goodbye.

1306
01:12:43,080 --> 01:12:44,593
She just won't come
out of that bedroom.

1307
01:12:44,800 --> 01:12:47,598
You know, she's been sick to her tummy
ever since last night.

1308
01:12:47,840 --> 01:12:51,116
- I think it was something that she ate.
- Just tell her I'm really sorry.

1309
01:12:51,320 --> 01:12:52,639
- Oh, sure.
- Oh.

1310
01:12:53,120 --> 01:12:54,439
Sure will.

1311
01:12:56,240 --> 01:12:58,117
Oh, so sweet, kids.

1312
01:13:00,320 --> 01:13:02,390
You'll always be my special lover.

1313
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:06,070
Ow! Oh, Edie.

1314
01:13:07,280 --> 01:13:08,508
Bye!

1315
01:13:08,720 --> 01:13:11,553
- Happy birthday, America!
- Bye!

1316
01:13:11,760 --> 01:13:13,512
- See ya, now!
- Bye-bye, now.

1317
01:13:15,880 --> 01:13:17,552
- Thank you.
- Bye.

1318
01:13:17,760 --> 01:13:21,548
Let's get out of here. You guys, go to
the RV. I'll get the keys from Skeeter.

1319
01:13:26,040 --> 01:13:27,439
Hello?!

1320
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:33,797
Hey, Brad, I was just gonna call you.

1321
01:13:34,160 --> 01:13:36,196
Where are you?
Thought you'd be here by now.

1322
01:13:36,360 --> 01:13:37,793
I told you I needed it today.

1323
01:13:37,960 --> 01:13:41,430
No, I know that. No, we just had a little
bit of engine trouble's all, okay?

1324
01:13:42,319 --> 01:13:44,278
We're gonna be on the
road in five minutes,

1325
01:13:44,530 --> 01:13:46,577
at your front door in
just a few hours, okay?

1326
01:13:46,612 --> 01:13:47,798
Nothing stopping us now.

1327
01:13:48,240 --> 01:13:49,673
What the fuck?

1328
01:13:51,760 --> 01:13:53,398
Hand me the phone.

1329
01:13:53,560 --> 01:13:55,949
Uh, Brad, can you hold on for a sec?

1330
01:13:56,320 --> 01:13:58,311
All right, let's not do anything rash.

1331
01:13:58,680 --> 01:14:01,194
- I'm David, what's your name?
- Pablo Chacon.

1332
01:14:01,360 --> 01:14:03,476
Shut the fuck up. Stop, stop.

1333
01:14:03,640 --> 01:14:06,359
- Hola, Brad.
- Pablo!

1334
01:14:08,480 --> 01:14:11,040
You send this amateur fuck-up
to steal from me?

1335
01:14:11,200 --> 01:14:13,919
Listen, I don't know
what David told you- Hello?

1336
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:17,673
I would have loved to
say good-bye to him.

1337
01:14:24,880 --> 01:14:25,915
Pablo Chacon.

1338
01:14:26,760 --> 01:14:29,797
Turns out there's a real Pablo Chacon
and we stole from him.

1339
01:14:29,960 --> 01:14:33,794
So this is probably gonna end well,
I would imagine.

1340
01:14:35,800 --> 01:14:37,995
I'll be right back.

1341
01:14:38,520 --> 01:14:39,555
No rush.

1342
01:14:41,280 --> 01:14:44,477
I thought you said we were
picking up drugs for Pablo Chacon.

1343
01:14:44,640 --> 01:14:47,279
I thought we were.
Brad told me he was Pablo Chacon.

1344
01:14:47,440 --> 01:14:49,670
- Why do you trust that guy?
- I don't, okay?

1345
01:14:49,880 --> 01:14:52,155
Can you guys stop bickering
for five seconds?

1346
01:14:52,320 --> 01:14:54,470
Okay, how did he even find us?

1347
01:14:54,640 --> 01:14:56,119
- We don't know.
- I don't know.

1348
01:14:56,280 --> 01:14:57,554
With this.

1349
01:14:59,600 --> 01:15:02,512
Cool, is that a transmitter?
That's like a...

1350
01:15:02,760 --> 01:15:04,955
You put that in the RV, huh?
In one of the bags?

1351
01:15:05,120 --> 01:15:09,318
- How could you not think of that?
- Because I don't know what I'm doing!

1352
01:15:09,520 --> 01:15:11,795
- Have you not figured that out?
- Silence!

1353
01:15:15,040 --> 01:15:16,598
You all die now.

1354
01:15:16,760 --> 01:15:19,069
But together as a family, with honor.

1355
01:15:19,800 --> 01:15:24,191
But we're not even a real family, okay?
I don't even know these people.

1356
01:15:25,760 --> 01:15:28,991
She's right. That's absolutely right.
No, no. We're not related at all, any of us.

1357
01:15:29,160 --> 01:15:30,513
No. We're just friends.

1358
01:15:30,680 --> 01:15:32,557
- No, we're not...
- We are not friends!

1359
01:15:32,720 --> 01:15:35,154
Look, I'm just a small-time
fucking drug dealer.

1360
01:15:35,320 --> 01:15:36,673
I sell dime bags, all right?

1361
01:15:36,880 --> 01:15:40,475
My daughter here
is just a homeless gutter punk, all right?

1362
01:15:40,680 --> 01:15:44,878
And my son is just a fucking dork that
lives in my building. We don't look alike!

1363
01:15:45,040 --> 01:15:47,713
- Not related.
- A virgin, okay? And my "wife"?

1364
01:15:48,160 --> 01:15:49,957
I mean, she's just a cheap stripper.

1365
01:15:50,120 --> 01:15:52,076
Hey, thanks, David. Nice.

1366
01:15:52,240 --> 01:15:54,800
- We will not do anything if...
- Wait, wait. Heh.

1367
01:15:54,960 --> 01:15:57,838
In the capri pants and the sensible
footwear, a stripper?

1368
01:15:59,080 --> 01:16:00,195
Yes.

1369
01:16:01,240 --> 01:16:02,355
That's right, I am...

1370
01:16:03,320 --> 01:16:04,878
...Mr. Chacon.

1371
01:16:05,720 --> 01:16:07,915
Just give me one chance...

1372
01:16:08,120 --> 01:16:13,194
...to prove to you that I'm worth
way more alive than I am dead.

1373
01:16:20,720 --> 01:16:25,271
# Sweet

1374
01:16:25,440 --> 01:16:30,150
# Emotion

1375
01:16:30,320 --> 01:16:33,118
# Talk about things
And nobody cares

1376
01:16:35,640 --> 01:16:37,995
# Wearing hot things
That nobody wears

1377
01:16:45,240 --> 01:16:48,312
# Some sweat hog knew
She's a real good liar

1378
01:16:49,880 --> 01:16:53,077
# 'Cause the backstage boogie
Set your pants on fire

1379
01:16:57,840 --> 01:17:01,753
# Sweet

1380
01:17:01,920 --> 01:17:06,471
# Emotion

1381
01:17:06,680 --> 01:17:11,390
# Sweet

1382
01:17:11,600 --> 01:17:15,309
# Emotion

1383
01:17:16,440 --> 01:17:19,398
# You stand in the front
Just a shakin ' your ass

1384
01:17:21,400 --> 01:17:24,597
# I'll take you backstage
You'll be drinking my glass

1385
01:17:26,240 --> 01:17:29,357
# I'm talkin' about something
You can sure understand

1386
01:17:43,920 --> 01:17:46,070
Have some respect,
it's your mother.

1387
01:18:19,360 --> 01:18:20,759
Get in the RV! Go, go, go!

1388
01:18:28,440 --> 01:18:29,475
Why are we fighting?

1389
01:18:34,600 --> 01:18:36,238
- Do you know how to drive this?
- No.

1390
01:18:37,280 --> 01:18:38,508
No weapons. Here we go.

1391
01:18:38,720 --> 01:18:40,870
- Hurry!
- I don't know how it works.

1392
01:18:43,520 --> 01:18:44,839
Fuck!

1393
01:18:49,560 --> 01:18:52,279
- What just happened?
- I knocked him out. Let's go.

1394
01:18:52,480 --> 01:18:53,629
- You did not.
- Yes, I did.

1395
01:18:57,720 --> 01:18:59,233
Come on, Rose, come on. Come on!

1396
01:19:02,720 --> 01:19:03,994
- Look out!
- Oh, no, please.

1397
01:19:10,440 --> 01:19:12,431
Kenny! Kenny, give me the wheel!

1398
01:19:12,680 --> 01:19:14,033
No, do not pull over!

1399
01:19:15,320 --> 01:19:18,039
Go this way!
No, no, no. Don't get on the freeway.

1400
01:19:18,240 --> 01:19:20,674
- Kenny, just let me in.
- I can't. I'll stop.

1401
01:19:20,880 --> 01:19:22,359
Don't stop! You can't stop.

1402
01:19:22,560 --> 01:19:23,834
Goddamn it, will you let go?

1403
01:19:24,040 --> 01:19:25,951
No, no, no, no!
You're gonna get us killed!

1404
01:19:30,040 --> 01:19:32,679
- All right, just get out of the way.
- I can't.

1405
01:19:44,760 --> 01:19:45,829
Is everybody okay?

1406
01:19:46,040 --> 01:19:47,837
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine. What...?

1407
01:19:48,040 --> 01:19:49,075
Fuck.

1408
01:19:51,480 --> 01:19:54,358
Fuck!

1409
01:19:54,880 --> 01:19:56,154
Ow! Shit! Fuck, fucking-

1410
01:19:56,320 --> 01:19:58,470
Ow, ow! Ow, ow, ow!

1411
01:19:58,640 --> 01:20:01,438
- Oh, my God. Fucking shit! Fuck!
- What the hell is he doing?

1412
01:20:01,600 --> 01:20:03,716
Fuck a donkey! It hurts so much.

1413
01:20:03,880 --> 01:20:06,189
Settle down, man.
What the hell's going on?

1414
01:20:06,400 --> 01:20:08,311
Oh, my God! I'm gonna die.

1415
01:20:08,480 --> 01:20:10,471
Kenny, listen to me.
Calm down, all right?

1416
01:20:10,640 --> 01:20:12,471
Not gonna die. Tell us what's going on.

1417
01:20:12,640 --> 01:20:15,200
- Tell us what happened.
- Fucking spider bit me, David!

1418
01:20:15,360 --> 01:20:17,920
- What? Where did it happen?
- Bit me on my balls.

1419
01:20:18,440 --> 01:20:21,910
On my fucking balls. On my balls,
on my fucking balls!

1420
01:20:22,080 --> 01:20:23,991
Oh, God. Let me see.
Kenny, let me see it.

1421
01:20:24,160 --> 01:20:26,720
No. No fucking way.
You're not seeing it.

1422
01:20:26,920 --> 01:20:30,629
Come on. I can't help you unless you
show me. Sweetie, just show it to me.

1423
01:20:30,840 --> 01:20:33,115
Kenny, will you just man up
and drop your pants?

1424
01:20:33,280 --> 01:20:34,952
We've all seen a dick.

1425
01:20:40,120 --> 01:20:41,553
All right, let's see it.

1426
01:20:43,960 --> 01:20:46,474
What? What is it?
What does it look like?

1427
01:20:46,640 --> 01:20:48,471
- I can't look.
- Um...

1428
01:20:48,640 --> 01:20:51,552
- Is it bad?
- Hey, listen to me. It's not that bad.

1429
01:20:51,720 --> 01:20:53,870
- Dude, it's really bad.
- No, it isn't.

1430
01:20:54,040 --> 01:20:56,634
- Have you seen what that... Look.
- I'm not gonna look.

1431
01:20:56,800 --> 01:20:59,951
- You're going to a hospital.
- What? No. No fucking way.

1432
01:21:00,160 --> 01:21:01,309
How bad is it?

1433
01:21:01,680 --> 01:21:04,513
You're okay. Rub some dirt
on it. Let's get back in the RV.

1434
01:21:04,680 --> 01:21:07,319
No. You're going to see a doctor.

1435
01:21:07,480 --> 01:21:09,596
No fucking way.
No, absolutely not, Rose.

1436
01:21:09,800 --> 01:21:12,360
He's not going to a hospital.
We don't have time.

1437
01:21:12,520 --> 01:21:14,715
Trust me. Kenny is fine.

1438
01:21:14,880 --> 01:21:17,394
I can't feel my bingo.

1439
01:21:19,640 --> 01:21:22,473
- Goddamn it, Kenny.
- Yeah. Totally fine.

1440
01:21:22,640 --> 01:21:25,677
- Go grab him. Grab him!
- If he's dead, we're leaving him.

1441
01:21:32,560 --> 01:21:36,473
Yeah, this is David Mille... David Clark,
calling for Mr. Gurdlinger again.

1442
01:21:37,520 --> 01:21:39,192
Yes, I'll hold.

1443
01:21:39,560 --> 01:21:42,393
Who's my big black and
white baby? Yeah.

1444
01:21:43,200 --> 01:21:45,156
You are. Yes, you are.

1445
01:21:49,680 --> 01:21:51,477
- Yellow-ski.
- Oh, hello, Brad.

1446
01:21:51,640 --> 01:21:54,438
Where the fuck have you been?
I left you five messages, man!

1447
01:21:54,600 --> 01:21:58,479
David! You're alive! Cool.
How'd that happen?

1448
01:21:58,680 --> 01:22:00,432
Ask the real Pablo Chacon.

1449
01:22:00,640 --> 01:22:01,993
I'm not gonna make excuses.

1450
01:22:02,440 --> 01:22:03,919
It was kind of a dick move.

1451
01:22:04,640 --> 01:22:06,676
- "A dick move"? A dick move!
- Little bit.

1452
01:22:07,080 --> 01:22:08,559
Little bit of a dick move.

1453
01:22:08,720 --> 01:22:11,439
Well, tell you what. I'm not driving
another fucking mile.

1454
01:22:11,600 --> 01:22:15,752
All right? I want goddamn hazard pay from
your ass. Otherwise, I'll turn around...

1455
01:22:15,920 --> 01:22:19,879
...and give this smidge of pot back to
Chacon, along with your fucking address.

1456
01:22:20,040 --> 01:22:21,109
Do you understand me?

1457
01:22:21,280 --> 01:22:23,510
Sounds like you're
threatening to double-cross me.

1458
01:22:23,680 --> 01:22:25,477
Fucking right I am.

1459
01:22:25,640 --> 01:22:27,596
And I'm kind of turned on right now.

1460
01:22:28,360 --> 01:22:30,954
You make a good case for hazard pay.
How much you want?

1461
01:22:31,120 --> 01:22:33,918
How much? Oh, I don't know,
half a million dollars.

1462
01:22:34,080 --> 01:22:35,354
- How about that?
- Done.

1463
01:22:36,560 --> 01:22:38,232
Fucking right, it's done. Good.

1464
01:22:38,400 --> 01:22:41,312
But I need it here by tonight
or the deal is off.

1465
01:22:42,040 --> 01:22:43,598
No problem. That's fine with me.

1466
01:22:43,760 --> 01:22:45,478
Where the hell are you, anyway?

1467
01:22:45,640 --> 01:22:50,714
We're at the Corrales Regional Medical
Center in Buttfuck, New Mexico.

1468
01:22:50,880 --> 01:22:52,233
- Why?
- Why? Why?

1469
01:22:52,440 --> 01:22:55,989
Because this goddamn Kenny kid got his
fucking nuts bit by a giant spider.

1470
01:22:56,160 --> 01:22:59,391
That is amazing. Will you let me know
if he develops super powers?

1471
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:02,070
Listen, man, giddyup, okay? Tick-tock.

1472
01:23:02,600 --> 01:23:04,909
Tick-tock. Okay.

1473
01:23:08,560 --> 01:23:10,949
Hola, Pablo. Es Brad.

1474
01:23:11,120 --> 01:23:14,032
Okay. Here me out.
I wanna ask you something.

1475
01:23:21,080 --> 01:23:22,832
Scottie? The doctor will see you now.

1476
01:23:26,680 --> 01:23:28,352
Text me, girl. I gotta bounce.

1477
01:23:29,000 --> 01:23:30,194
Know what I'm saying?

1478
01:23:32,520 --> 01:23:35,990
Oh, God. Really? That guy?

1479
01:23:36,800 --> 01:23:39,360
- What? He's hot.
- Okay.

1480
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:41,194
"I gotta bounce. "

1481
01:23:42,480 --> 01:23:44,311
- Miller family?
- Yeah.

1482
01:23:44,760 --> 01:23:47,228
Hi. Hello, how are you?

1483
01:23:47,440 --> 01:23:50,113
Oh, great. What's the news,
doc, huh? Can we get going?

1484
01:23:50,320 --> 01:23:52,072
- He's about to tell us.
- Oh, good.

1485
01:23:52,280 --> 01:23:56,034
I'm afraid your son had a pretty severe
allergic reaction to the spider's venom.

1486
01:23:56,240 --> 01:23:58,231
Ooh. Too bad. Better get him home.
Where is he?

1487
01:23:58,440 --> 01:24:02,513
He's in a lot of pain right now, we won't be
able to release him for a few hours yet.

1488
01:24:04,800 --> 01:24:07,189
- Why?
- David? David, David! Stop it.

1489
01:24:08,360 --> 01:24:09,679
Please. Continue.

1490
01:24:10,640 --> 01:24:12,437
Uh, he's on an IV
to get some antibiotics...

1491
01:24:13,880 --> 01:24:16,394
Who the fuck cares, man?
Okay? We got shit to do.

1492
01:24:16,600 --> 01:24:19,637
Go get my son and bring him
and his giant nut out here right now.

1493
01:24:19,840 --> 01:24:23,230
Stop it. Doctor, thank you.
I appreciate you taking care of our son.

1494
01:24:23,440 --> 01:24:27,069
- Thank you very much.
- Sure. You seem like a very caring father.

1495
01:24:28,720 --> 01:24:31,234
- What is your fucking problem?
- What?!

1496
01:24:31,440 --> 01:24:33,954
Are you crazy? It's only a few hours.
We'll be fine.

1497
01:24:34,160 --> 01:24:35,388
No, we're not fine. Okay?

1498
01:24:35,600 --> 01:24:38,558
We'll be dead in a few hours.
You forget who's following us?

1499
01:24:38,800 --> 01:24:41,109
Look, here's what I say
we do, all right?

1500
01:24:41,600 --> 01:24:44,239
We leave him here,
and then we just keep going, all right?

1501
01:24:44,440 --> 01:24:47,352
So you're saying that the three
of us, we just leave him here.

1502
01:24:47,600 --> 01:24:51,479
No! No, no, no. We don't leave him here.
No. Absolutely not. No, we leave...

1503
01:24:51,720 --> 01:24:53,073
...with him here.

1504
01:24:56,040 --> 01:24:57,075
Okay.

1505
01:25:03,080 --> 01:25:05,435
You know, if we leave Kenny here,
it really isn't...

1506
01:25:06,120 --> 01:25:07,155
Ah.

1507
01:25:07,360 --> 01:25:10,079
No. I don't know where I was going
with that. That's stupid.

1508
01:25:10,280 --> 01:25:11,554
Seriously.

1509
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:15,353
- What's that?
- I don't know.

1510
01:25:15,560 --> 01:25:18,313
- Don't answer it! It's for me!
- What?

1511
01:25:19,280 --> 01:25:20,315
What's up, dawg?

1512
01:25:20,760 --> 01:25:22,318
Not much, dawg. What's up with you?

1513
01:25:22,520 --> 01:25:24,476
Here to pick up Casey,
know what I'm saying?

1514
01:25:24,720 --> 01:25:27,188
I'm awake and I speak English,
so, yeah, I do know.

1515
01:25:28,360 --> 01:25:31,557
- What's your name, man? - Scottie P.,
you know what I'm saying? Ha-ha.

1516
01:25:32,360 --> 01:25:34,112
Again, I do know what you're saying.

1517
01:25:34,320 --> 01:25:36,788
But I appreciate you continuing
to check in with me.

1518
01:25:37,000 --> 01:25:39,594
- Hi! Bye. We're gonna go.
- Whoa, wait!

1519
01:25:39,800 --> 01:25:42,030
- Where do you think you're going?
- Out.

1520
01:25:42,680 --> 01:25:44,671
I have just made lunch.

1521
01:25:44,880 --> 01:25:47,189
- When are you coming back?
- I don't know, later.

1522
01:25:47,400 --> 01:25:49,277
No! Hey, stop! Stop, listen to me.

1523
01:25:49,480 --> 01:25:51,277
Once Kenny is ready,
we're out of here.

1524
01:25:51,480 --> 01:25:54,950
We will leave with or without you.
If you're not here, we're gone. Got it?

1525
01:25:55,160 --> 01:25:57,230
Okay, fine. That's totally fine.

1526
01:25:57,440 --> 01:26:00,352
Wait. Come here.
I'd like to have a chat with your friend.

1527
01:26:00,560 --> 01:26:02,994
- Are you kidding me?
- I am not kidding you.

1528
01:26:03,200 --> 01:26:04,599
Would you please have a seat.

1529
01:26:05,720 --> 01:26:06,994
What is going on?

1530
01:26:13,000 --> 01:26:17,198
So, Scottie P.,
what exactly do you do for a living?

1531
01:26:17,480 --> 01:26:20,438
- Oh, Mom!
- I work for A & J Amusements.

1532
01:26:20,600 --> 01:26:23,068
I'm rocking that Monkey Maze,
you know what I'm saying?

1533
01:26:23,280 --> 01:26:27,558
- What the hell is the Monkey Maze?
- Oh, it's like a Terrifying Deathtrap...

1534
01:26:27,720 --> 01:26:29,119
...but for little kids.

1535
01:26:29,320 --> 01:26:31,550
You're working at the fair.
You're a carny.

1536
01:26:31,720 --> 01:26:34,314
No, I drive a motorcycle.

1537
01:26:34,480 --> 01:26:35,833
- Mm-hm.
- Mm-hm.

1538
01:26:36,040 --> 01:26:37,234
Yeah.

1539
01:26:37,400 --> 01:26:41,313
What about you guys? Where you, uh,
stopping in from, you know what I'm saying?

1540
01:26:41,480 --> 01:26:43,471
- Uh, D-town.
- Oh, Detroit.

1541
01:26:43,640 --> 01:26:46,074
No, no, no. The other one.

1542
01:26:46,240 --> 01:26:47,958
D- town. The other D-town.

1543
01:26:48,120 --> 01:26:50,475
- Denver...?
- That's the one. There you go.

1544
01:26:50,680 --> 01:26:52,033
- Colorado.
- That's the one.

1545
01:26:52,200 --> 01:26:54,395
Yeah, I love my Rockies,
you know what I'm saying?

1546
01:26:54,600 --> 01:26:56,670
Oh, you like the Rockies?
You're a baseball fan?

1547
01:26:57,600 --> 01:26:59,955
- Uh, no, the mountains.
- Of course.

1548
01:27:01,360 --> 01:27:02,793
Hey, those are cool tats, man.

1549
01:27:02,960 --> 01:27:05,110
Oh, for real. Thank you, bro.
You see the cobra?

1550
01:27:05,520 --> 01:27:07,670
- What's this? The one right there?
- Oh, this?

1551
01:27:07,840 --> 01:27:09,273
Uh-huh.

1552
01:27:09,440 --> 01:27:11,351
That's my credo. "No ragrets. "

1553
01:27:11,520 --> 01:27:14,398
Mm-hm. How about that.

1554
01:27:15,120 --> 01:27:17,076
- You have no regrets?
- Nope.

1555
01:27:17,240 --> 01:27:20,869
- Not one?
- Nope. Ha, ha.

1556
01:27:21,040 --> 01:27:23,474
I wish I did.
To talk about something.

1557
01:27:23,640 --> 01:27:24,709
Not one regret, huh?

1558
01:27:24,920 --> 01:27:27,070
That's how I been
living my whole life.

1559
01:27:27,240 --> 01:27:29,276
I went to a tattoo artist, I was like:

1560
01:27:29,440 --> 01:27:31,635
"This how I live.
Can you put that on my body?"

1561
01:27:31,800 --> 01:27:33,313
- And he did it.
- Dad.

1562
01:27:33,480 --> 01:27:36,597
- Not even a single letter?
- No, I can't think of one.

1563
01:27:36,760 --> 01:27:39,593
- I love all the letters, know
what I'm saying? - Yeah.

1564
01:27:39,760 --> 01:27:41,796
A lot of letters in the alphabet.
How many?

1565
01:27:41,960 --> 01:27:44,918
- It's in the 20s.
- It's definitely in the 20s, I agree.

1566
01:27:45,080 --> 01:27:47,548
Twenty-six, I think, if you count Y.

1567
01:27:47,720 --> 01:27:50,792
- Do you have any questions
for us, Scottie P? - Dad.

1568
01:27:51,520 --> 01:27:54,432
- How did you make her so hot?
- What's that?

1569
01:27:54,920 --> 01:27:57,639
- Uh, Casey.
- Aw, that's very sweet of you.

1570
01:27:57,800 --> 01:28:00,155
He wants to know
how we made Casey so hot.

1571
01:28:00,320 --> 01:28:03,596
- It's, uh...
- You guys had to...

1572
01:28:03,760 --> 01:28:06,274
- What'd you ask us?
- ... seminate, like, each other?

1573
01:28:06,440 --> 01:28:08,271
Uh... Sorry?

1574
01:28:08,440 --> 01:28:11,000
- Oh, my God.
- Like, is there a way to make them, like...

1575
01:28:11,160 --> 01:28:12,275
...attractive? Like, kids?

1576
01:28:13,440 --> 01:28:15,590
- Doggie style. Know what I mean?
- Dope.

1577
01:28:17,440 --> 01:28:21,228
- Dad.
- Well, I love him. I think he's great.

1578
01:28:21,440 --> 01:28:24,113
A real winner.
If I were you, I wouldn't use protection.

1579
01:28:24,280 --> 01:28:25,793
Scottie P., you're the man.

1580
01:28:25,960 --> 01:28:27,837
- Yo, for real. Thanks, man.
- We're leaving. Bye!

1581
01:28:28,680 --> 01:28:30,989
- Nice meeting you. You do you, Scottie P.
- You too.

1582
01:28:37,600 --> 01:28:39,318
Casey, make good choices!

1583
01:28:42,400 --> 01:28:43,992
Come on, she's gonna be fine.

1584
01:28:44,200 --> 01:28:46,873
Tattooed kid on a motorcycle,
no helmet.

1585
01:28:47,600 --> 01:28:49,556
Actually, she might
already be pregnant.

1586
01:28:56,320 --> 01:28:59,039
I cannot believe her.
Where the hell is she?

1587
01:28:59,240 --> 01:29:02,915
Look who is concerned about someone
other than themselves.

1588
01:29:03,120 --> 01:29:05,076
What? I just want to get back on
the road.

1589
01:29:05,280 --> 01:29:06,633
No, I know.

1590
01:29:07,000 --> 01:29:08,752
That kid was a dickhead, huh?

1591
01:29:08,960 --> 01:29:10,279
- Right?
- Know what I'm saying?

1592
01:29:10,480 --> 01:29:13,392
- Ha! Jerk.
- Unbelievable.

1593
01:29:13,600 --> 01:29:15,909
Must get her shitty taste in men
from her mother.

1594
01:29:19,400 --> 01:29:21,709
I'm sorry. It was a cheap shot.

1595
01:29:21,920 --> 01:29:24,354
Cheap shot, okay? I'm taking it back.

1596
01:29:25,320 --> 01:29:28,835
I'm sure your boyfriend Jimmy
is very nice.

1597
01:29:29,040 --> 01:29:31,873
He seems like a very good guy.

1598
01:29:32,520 --> 01:29:34,829
Well, he's not. He left.

1599
01:29:35,320 --> 01:29:38,630
Maxed out all my credit cards,
cleaned out my bank account...

1600
01:29:38,840 --> 01:29:40,239
...jetted out of town.

1601
01:29:40,440 --> 01:29:44,991
He stole my favorite mug. Which was
a pretty shitty thing to do. Even for him.

1602
01:29:45,200 --> 01:29:47,634
- I'm really sorry about that. That sucks.
- Whatever.

1603
01:29:47,880 --> 01:29:50,792
That's what you get
for dating a guy who dates strippers.

1604
01:29:51,360 --> 01:29:52,395
Ah, come on.

1605
01:29:52,600 --> 01:29:54,750
You're a lot more than that, Rose,
and you know it.

1606
01:29:58,200 --> 01:30:01,033
- What?
- Rose is not even my real name.

1607
01:30:03,000 --> 01:30:04,319
What's your real name?

1608
01:30:05,720 --> 01:30:06,914
Sarah.

1609
01:30:07,680 --> 01:30:08,795
With an "h"?

1610
01:30:09,160 --> 01:30:11,469
Yep. Right there at the end.

1611
01:30:11,680 --> 01:30:13,238
It's the best way to spell it.

1612
01:30:13,440 --> 01:30:16,318
- That's what my mother thought. Heh.
- Heh.

1613
01:30:18,400 --> 01:30:20,197
Well, David's not my real name either.

1614
01:30:20,640 --> 01:30:23,359
- Really?
- I'm being serious.

1615
01:30:24,680 --> 01:30:27,319
Wow. So you're being ser-

1616
01:30:27,560 --> 01:30:30,552
Well, so then, what's your real name?

1617
01:30:30,920 --> 01:30:32,035
Barbara.

1618
01:30:32,240 --> 01:30:34,470
- Barbara?
- Yeah, named after my mom.

1619
01:30:34,680 --> 01:30:36,955
Oh, so, what are you, like,
a Barbara Jr.?

1620
01:30:38,320 --> 01:30:40,311
- You're Barbara Jr.
- You got it. Yeah, yeah.

1621
01:30:40,520 --> 01:30:43,159
My friends in high school
and grade school called me Babs.

1622
01:30:43,360 --> 01:30:44,873
Oh, scarred childhood.

1623
01:30:45,120 --> 01:30:49,033
Not really, not at all. I mean, I was in
musical theater, so I was actually revered.

1624
01:30:50,400 --> 01:30:51,435
Very funny.

1625
01:30:53,360 --> 01:30:54,839
You have a hair...

1626
01:30:56,920 --> 01:30:58,353
Yank, or put behind the ear?

1627
01:30:58,560 --> 01:30:59,788
Guess we could...

1628
01:31:00,640 --> 01:31:01,755
...tuck it back there.

1629
01:31:04,880 --> 01:31:06,950
Whoa. What's going on in here?

1630
01:31:07,560 --> 01:31:10,279
We should ask you the same thing,
young lady! Huh?

1631
01:31:10,520 --> 01:31:12,511
- We've been worried sick.
- That's right.

1632
01:31:12,720 --> 01:31:14,870
Why are you guys talking like that?

1633
01:31:15,200 --> 01:31:16,269
Shit, is someone here?

1634
01:31:16,480 --> 01:31:19,438
Yeah! Yeah, us.
We're here. That's who's here.

1635
01:31:19,760 --> 01:31:22,194
We didn't know if you were dead
in a ditch! Huh?

1636
01:31:22,400 --> 01:31:23,958
You couldn't have called?
Something?

1637
01:31:24,200 --> 01:31:27,112
Or send one of those text messages
you're always sending out?

1638
01:31:27,320 --> 01:31:31,438
"Hey, it"s me, Casey, I'm not dead in a
ditch. " LOL, picture of a whale, #YOLO.

1639
01:31:31,760 --> 01:31:33,239
- Anything!
- Okay.

1640
01:31:33,760 --> 01:31:35,193
Fine! Whatever!

1641
01:31:35,400 --> 01:31:37,038
Sorry.

1642
01:31:37,240 --> 01:31:38,468
- Whoa!
- Thank you!

1643
01:31:38,720 --> 01:31:40,472
- Was that so hard?
- Appreciate that.

1644
01:31:40,720 --> 01:31:43,871
- She learned a new word, Rose.
- Thank God. "I'm sorry. "

1645
01:31:44,360 --> 01:31:46,191
Un-fucking-believable.

1646
01:31:46,640 --> 01:31:47,993
It's gonna be great.

1647
01:31:48,920 --> 01:31:51,036
Oh! There he is. Kenny!

1648
01:31:51,240 --> 01:31:53,708
- Okay, let's go.
- Oh, my God, you look so much better.

1649
01:31:53,920 --> 01:31:56,150
- Doesn't he?
- Like a thousand bucks. Let's go.

1650
01:31:59,000 --> 01:32:01,230
- Come on, we gotta hurry. Come on!
- Take it easy!

1651
01:32:01,440 --> 01:32:03,271
- Will you just relax?!
- Look, I can't...

1652
01:32:04,120 --> 01:32:05,155
- Oh, great.
- Aah!

1653
01:32:05,360 --> 01:32:07,794
- Kenny.
- That's my elbow. Oh...

1654
01:32:08,040 --> 01:32:10,235
- Are you okay?
- I think so.

1655
01:32:10,440 --> 01:32:13,079
Look what happens when you
run around like a crazy person.

1656
01:32:13,280 --> 01:32:16,272
What do mean? He's fine.
Come on, Ken-doll, hop up. Here we go.

1657
01:32:16,480 --> 01:32:18,550
- What's wrong with you?
- What's wrong with me?

1658
01:32:18,800 --> 01:32:21,394
- David!
- Look, this job has a deadline...

1659
01:32:21,600 --> 01:32:23,477
...and it's in four fucking hours.

1660
01:32:23,720 --> 01:32:27,429
If you think I'm gonna lose half a million
dollars because of Kenny's boo-boos...

1661
01:32:27,680 --> 01:32:29,955
- ... then you're out of your mind.
- Whoa. Wait a second.

1662
01:32:30,680 --> 01:32:33,911
You're making half a million dollars
on this deal?

1663
01:32:36,240 --> 01:32:40,233
- Uh, roughly.
- I cannot believe you.

1664
01:32:40,440 --> 01:32:41,873
Listen to me. I can explain.

1665
01:32:42,080 --> 01:32:47,279
You are making $500,000
and you were only gonna pay me 30?

1666
01:32:47,480 --> 01:32:51,029
You're getting 30 grand?
I'm getting a thousand!

1667
01:32:51,560 --> 01:32:53,073
Wait, you guys are getting paid?

1668
01:32:53,280 --> 01:32:54,713
- You're a liar.
- No, no, no.

1669
01:32:54,960 --> 01:32:57,030
- We want to renegotiate.
- No. No way.

1670
01:32:57,240 --> 01:32:58,559
- What? David.
- No. No way.

1671
01:32:58,800 --> 01:33:02,918
You made your deal with me, I made my
deal with Brad. We're getting outta here.

1672
01:33:03,880 --> 01:33:07,236
See? Good. Casey gets it.
We're not renegotiating now. Let's go.

1673
01:33:07,440 --> 01:33:11,228
I believe we are, right now, because you
wouldn't even be here if it wasn't for us.

1674
01:33:11,480 --> 01:33:12,629
You're right about that.

1675
01:33:12,840 --> 01:33:15,559
I'd be in Denver now if it wasn't
for you slowing me down.

1676
01:33:15,760 --> 01:33:19,150
Are you shitting...? Slowing you down?
What the hell are you talking...?

1677
01:33:19,800 --> 01:33:21,995
Whoa, where the hell are you going?
Hey, hey!

1678
01:33:22,240 --> 01:33:24,037
Hey, I said where are you going?

1679
01:33:24,280 --> 01:33:26,316
You know what? You leave,
you get nothing.

1680
01:33:26,520 --> 01:33:27,953
I don't want your money, okay?

1681
01:33:28,200 --> 01:33:31,033
Casey, come back.
We have to stay together.

1682
01:33:31,240 --> 01:33:32,753
- Come on!
- Why?

1683
01:33:33,520 --> 01:33:34,953
Because we're a family? Huh?

1684
01:33:35,400 --> 01:33:38,392
You want to spend Christmas together?
Help me with my homework?

1685
01:33:38,720 --> 01:33:41,678
Please. This whole thing
has been a total joke.

1686
01:33:42,720 --> 01:33:45,871
Oh, no, I'll tell you what the joke is!
You want to know what the...?

1687
01:33:46,880 --> 01:33:47,995
The j...

1688
01:33:48,440 --> 01:33:50,078
I'm not gonna tell you the joke!

1689
01:33:50,280 --> 01:33:53,477
You don't deserve to hear the joke!
Let's go.

1690
01:33:53,680 --> 01:33:56,069
- I don't think you knew the joke.
- I knew a joke.

1691
01:33:56,280 --> 01:33:57,952
We have to go back and get her.

1692
01:33:58,160 --> 01:34:00,674
What? Are you kidding me?
She left! Screw her, okay?

1693
01:34:00,880 --> 01:34:02,552
Are you coming with me or not, Rose?

1694
01:34:04,040 --> 01:34:07,430
Fine. I'll slide your check
under your door. Kenny, let's go.

1695
01:34:09,200 --> 01:34:10,713
Kenny, come on! Let's go, man.

1696
01:34:10,920 --> 01:34:13,514
We can't leave her,
David. It's not right.

1697
01:34:16,240 --> 01:34:17,593
- You know what?
- What?

1698
01:34:18,000 --> 01:34:19,752
You all deserve each other.

1699
01:34:22,680 --> 01:34:23,999
Da... Wha...?

1700
01:34:35,000 --> 01:34:36,319
He'll come back.

1701
01:34:37,040 --> 01:34:38,075
Right?

1702
01:34:59,320 --> 01:35:00,355
Yo, girl!

1703
01:35:02,200 --> 01:35:04,555
- I got your text. What's up?
- Hey.

1704
01:35:04,760 --> 01:35:05,988
Are you alone?

1705
01:35:06,520 --> 01:35:10,399
Yeah. You think we can go someplace
private and talk?

1706
01:35:11,280 --> 01:35:14,716
I know just the spot,
you know what I'm saying? Heh-heh.

1707
01:35:20,320 --> 01:35:23,153
- A little better. - See, you're
not in synch with what I'm doing.

1708
01:35:23,360 --> 01:35:26,272
I'm just playing a major scale,
but, um, we can move it down.

1709
01:35:26,440 --> 01:35:27,714
- Let's move it.
- Shitty scale.

1710
01:35:27,880 --> 01:35:29,359
Stop talking. Just shut the fuck up.

1711
01:35:31,480 --> 01:35:32,993
- Hey, what's up?
- Hey, Brad.

1712
01:35:33,200 --> 01:35:36,237
I'm just getting some singing lessons
from my main man Ben Folds Five.

1713
01:35:36,400 --> 01:35:39,790
- Ain't that right, Ben Folds Five?
- My name is Ben Folds.

1714
01:35:40,000 --> 01:35:41,718
"Five" is the name of the band.

1715
01:35:41,920 --> 01:35:43,638
You're fucking with me. I love it.

1716
01:35:43,840 --> 01:35:47,116
You gotta meet this guy.
Benji Five is a laugh riot.

1717
01:35:47,280 --> 01:35:49,111
Remember that song "Brick"
we used to listen to?

1718
01:35:49,280 --> 01:35:53,432
She's a brick and
I'm drowning slowly

1719
01:35:53,640 --> 01:35:56,393
It's... I've got... It's that guy.
I fucking got that guy.

1720
01:35:56,600 --> 01:35:58,158
He's like my personal bitch.

1721
01:35:58,320 --> 01:36:00,595
- Listen, is everything okay?
- Yeah.

1722
01:36:00,760 --> 01:36:02,751
Yeah, yeah. Uh, things are fine.

1723
01:36:02,920 --> 01:36:05,878
I'm about 200 miles away.
I'll be there in three hours, all right?

1724
01:36:06,040 --> 01:36:09,555
- All right. Peace.
- Agh, fucking asshole.

1725
01:36:09,720 --> 01:36:11,039
Scales. Let's do this.

1726
01:36:11,240 --> 01:36:12,593
This gig sucks.

1727
01:36:12,760 --> 01:36:14,796
Don't talk to me like that.
I will have you killed.

1728
01:36:14,960 --> 01:36:16,791
And no one will miss
your fucking nerd music.

1729
01:36:26,400 --> 01:36:28,152
Sunday, Sunday, Sunday!

1730
01:36:28,360 --> 01:36:29,998
Great. That's loud.

1731
01:36:38,120 --> 01:36:41,317
Yeah, nice try, radio.
Nice try. Heh.

1732
01:36:42,000 --> 01:36:43,752
Okay. Ahem.

1733
01:36:43,960 --> 01:36:45,154
Let's get there.

1734
01:36:47,760 --> 01:36:49,557
Hoo.

1735
01:36:51,000 --> 01:36:52,228
Quiet.

1736
01:36:59,120 --> 01:37:00,758
And I knew better too.

1737
01:37:01,000 --> 01:37:03,309
But we were all on
the road together...

1738
01:37:03,520 --> 01:37:06,318
...and it got kind of fun, you know?

1739
01:37:07,160 --> 01:37:08,195
Yeah. Uh-huh.

1740
01:37:08,800 --> 01:37:11,633
And I started thinking of us as kind of
like this...

1741
01:37:13,120 --> 01:37:14,712
Whatever, it's stupid.

1742
01:37:15,760 --> 01:37:19,443
- Fuck them.
- Yeah, fuck them. Yo, right now, girl,

1743
01:37:19,835 --> 01:37:22,964
Scottie P. is gonna make you feel
real good, know what I'm saying?

1744
01:37:22,999 --> 01:37:25,035
- Ha-ha.
- Uh, heh.

1745
01:37:25,240 --> 01:37:28,357
I'm sorry, I'm just feeling kind of cry-ey
and that...

1746
01:37:29,520 --> 01:37:31,351
- I'm just gonna go, okay?
- Come on, girl.

1747
01:37:31,560 --> 01:37:33,869
- You texted me. You know what's up.
- Scottie.

1748
01:37:34,080 --> 01:37:35,308
Hey!

1749
01:37:35,520 --> 01:37:36,635
Get your hands off of her!

1750
01:37:36,840 --> 01:37:38,159
Come here, Casey.

1751
01:37:38,600 --> 01:37:40,192
You put your hands on her again...

1752
01:37:40,400 --> 01:37:43,073
...I will rip that fucking tattoo
right off of your chest.

1753
01:37:43,280 --> 01:37:44,349
You know what I'm saying?

1754
01:37:44,560 --> 01:37:46,596
- Oh, really, bitch?
- Yeah, bitch.

1755
01:37:46,800 --> 01:37:49,872
You know what? Why don't you leave
the girls alone, man.

1756
01:37:50,080 --> 01:37:51,672
What are you gonna do, eyebrows?

1757
01:37:53,240 --> 01:37:54,673
One...

1758
01:37:55,400 --> 01:37:56,628
...two...

1759
01:37:58,280 --> 01:38:00,396
Ow! Broke my nose!

1760
01:38:01,920 --> 01:38:04,753
You're an aggressive woman.
Know what I'm saying?

1761
01:38:07,240 --> 01:38:08,275
Are you okay?

1762
01:38:08,520 --> 01:38:10,988
I'm fine. That was awesome.
You fucking decked him!

1763
01:38:11,200 --> 01:38:13,509
I've dealt with handsy
assholes like him at work.

1764
01:38:13,760 --> 01:38:14,988
Let's just get out of here.

1765
01:38:15,240 --> 01:38:16,992
Thanks for the backup.
Why the counting?

1766
01:38:17,240 --> 01:38:19,435
If you're gonna punch someone,
punch them on one.

1767
01:38:19,640 --> 01:38:20,993
Well, David told me to count.

1768
01:38:21,240 --> 01:38:23,470
David? David hasn't punched
anybody ever.

1769
01:38:28,320 --> 01:38:30,231
I think this way. Exit.

1770
01:38:34,120 --> 01:38:36,680
I have returned.

1771
01:38:38,520 --> 01:38:40,795
Ha-ha-ha. So here's
what happened, okay?

1772
01:38:41,492 --> 01:38:44,502
I'm out on the open road,
just by myself, right?

1773
01:38:44,908 --> 01:38:47,024
And I'm just beelining
it to a huge payday.

1774
01:38:47,059 --> 01:38:48,669
And I start to realize something:
it's boring in here.

1775
01:38:48,840 --> 01:38:50,751
So I thought,
"You know what you gotta do, dummy?

1776
01:38:50,920 --> 01:38:54,515
You gotta turn this RV around
and go back and get those dip sticks. "

1777
01:38:54,680 --> 01:38:57,911
Heh. I'm just kidding,
you're not dip sticks.

1778
01:38:58,080 --> 01:38:59,877
What do you say we go home?
Come on, let's go.

1779
01:39:00,040 --> 01:39:01,837
Hey, David? Go fuck yourself.

1780
01:39:02,480 --> 01:39:04,277
Uh...? Ha!

1781
01:39:04,880 --> 01:39:07,348
"Go fuck yourself. "
"You go fuck yourself. "

1782
01:39:07,669 --> 01:39:09,538
Rose, you say,
"Go fuck yourself. "

1783
01:39:09,952 --> 01:39:11,959
Then Kenny's like,
"I don't want to fuck anybody. "

1784
01:39:12,200 --> 01:39:15,272
This is what I miss, right?
The Ping-Pong action, the repartee.

1785
01:39:16,354 --> 01:39:18,515
Come on, guys
Let's get out of here, go home.

1786
01:39:18,860 --> 01:39:21,702
Get in the RV, go home, get out of here.
Come on, let's go!

1787
01:39:22,360 --> 01:39:25,113
- Whoa, hey, hold on. Where you going?
- Are you serious?

1788
01:39:25,280 --> 01:39:27,191
Look, look, look. Okay.

1789
01:39:27,360 --> 01:39:29,794
I know what this is about, and I get it.

1790
01:39:29,960 --> 01:39:32,997
All right?
We're gonna split the $500,000.

1791
01:39:33,160 --> 01:39:37,039
Evenly. Betwixt the four of us.

1792
01:39:37,440 --> 01:39:40,477
You guys get what I'm saying here?
Kenny, you wanna be like this: "Pfft!"

1793
01:39:40,640 --> 01:39:44,076
Like you're from... Right?
That's a lot of video games, kiddo.

1794
01:39:44,240 --> 01:39:47,630
All right, Casey, you can buy a house,
and run away from it.

1795
01:39:48,040 --> 01:39:50,508
You know what I mean? Like, whatever.
You get $125,000.

1796
01:39:50,680 --> 01:39:51,795
You get $125,000.

1797
01:39:52,000 --> 01:39:54,673
You get a... I mean, I'm like
fucking Oprah here. You know?

1798
01:39:54,880 --> 01:39:57,474
If she was a white dude
at a carnival. Heh.

1799
01:39:57,640 --> 01:40:00,200
Come on, guys.
Let's get in the RV...

1800
01:40:00,360 --> 01:40:03,927
...and take our butts back to
Denver where we're gonna be rich,

1801
01:40:04,268 --> 01:40:05,575
and we're gonna get paid.

1802
01:40:05,610 --> 01:40:07,754
- Come on, come on.
- Uh, David, listen.

1803
01:40:07,960 --> 01:40:10,952
You misled us. You left us.

1804
01:40:11,478 --> 01:40:14,015
And then you come
waltzing back in here all...

1805
01:40:14,362 --> 01:40:15,947
I don't know what
the hell that was...

1806
01:40:15,982 --> 01:40:17,668
...and you just expect
that we all just forget about it.

1807
01:40:17,840 --> 01:40:20,559
What's wrong with you?

1808
01:40:21,400 --> 01:40:22,435
How do we trust you?

1809
01:40:26,480 --> 01:40:29,392
Okay, look, what do you want?
Do you want me to beg?

1810
01:40:29,600 --> 01:40:31,158
Kids? What do you think?

1811
01:40:31,320 --> 01:40:34,039
- That would make me feel a lot better.
- Works for me. Sure.

1812
01:40:36,520 --> 01:40:38,112
You're joking.

1813
01:40:39,920 --> 01:40:41,035
Wha...?

1814
01:40:41,440 --> 01:40:44,557
You really want me to get
on my knees? And beg you?

1815
01:40:45,360 --> 01:40:47,191
It's a good thing I'm wearing
my begging pants.

1816
01:40:47,360 --> 01:40:49,555
I usually only do this before sex.

1817
01:40:51,080 --> 01:40:53,833
Okay, okay, I'm going, I'm going.
Please, please.

1818
01:40:54,000 --> 01:40:56,958
Ahem. Let's do it. Here we go.

1819
01:40:57,120 --> 01:40:58,155
Okay! To the RV, let's go.

1820
01:40:58,560 --> 01:40:59,595
Come on, Babs.

1821
01:41:02,960 --> 01:41:05,428
Whoa, whoa. Slow down.
There's clowns everywhere.

1822
01:41:05,640 --> 01:41:06,789
Here, let Pops get in here.

1823
01:41:07,000 --> 01:41:09,275
We're right down here.
I parked it next to an RV.

1824
01:41:14,200 --> 01:41:15,474
- Melissa.
- Kenny.

1825
01:41:15,680 --> 01:41:17,238
- Rose!
- Edie.

1826
01:41:17,440 --> 01:41:18,634
- Shit.
- Shit.

1827
01:41:18,880 --> 01:41:21,189
I never get used to that language.

1828
01:41:22,280 --> 01:41:26,159
What in the H-E-L-L
are you people doing here?

1829
01:41:26,480 --> 01:41:27,595
Uh... Uh, uh...

1830
01:41:27,800 --> 01:41:30,109
- We came to see the fireworks.
- Yeah. Fireworks.

1831
01:41:30,600 --> 01:41:34,798
Us too! That's so weird!
They're supposed to be amazing here.

1832
01:41:35,000 --> 01:41:36,433
- Melissa, can we talk?
- No.

1833
01:41:36,640 --> 01:41:38,392
- Mom, come on, let's go.
- Melissa!

1834
01:41:38,800 --> 01:41:40,870
Why are you being so rude?

1835
01:41:41,080 --> 01:41:43,674
Do you have your period?
Do you need a tampin?

1836
01:41:43,880 --> 01:41:46,872
Mom, I don't need a tampin.
I don't want to be near these people.

1837
01:41:47,120 --> 01:41:49,236
- Kenny. Let's go.
- We should get out of here.

1838
01:41:49,560 --> 01:41:52,472
- What happened last night was wrong.
- Oh, boy.

1839
01:41:54,400 --> 01:41:55,992
Oh, my God, she knows.

1840
01:41:57,720 --> 01:41:59,790
My daughter knows
what we've done.

1841
01:42:00,880 --> 01:42:04,031
Melissa, yes, it was wrong of me
to fondle Mrs. Miller's breasts.

1842
01:42:04,640 --> 01:42:08,394
You're right. I'm not gonna deny that it
gave me a certain amount of pleasure.

1843
01:42:08,640 --> 01:42:13,714
That said, your father and I are struggling
with some serious intimacy issues.

1844
01:42:13,920 --> 01:42:15,035
Okay, no, stop!

1845
01:42:15,240 --> 01:42:16,753
I'm not as tight as I once was.

1846
01:42:16,960 --> 01:42:19,349
- Look...
- He just falls right out.

1847
01:42:19,560 --> 01:42:21,596
It's like throwing a hot dog
down a hallway.

1848
01:42:21,800 --> 01:42:23,950
Ew! What are you talking about?

1849
01:42:24,160 --> 01:42:28,472
I saw Kenny making out with his sister
and mother while their dad watched.

1850
01:42:29,840 --> 01:42:31,398
What? Oh, my...!

1851
01:42:31,600 --> 01:42:34,717
- It wasn't quite like that.
- That's not exactly what happened.

1852
01:42:34,960 --> 01:42:37,838
Rose isn't my mom, she's not
my sister. We're not a real family.

1853
01:42:38,080 --> 01:42:40,196
That's enough, son!
What are you saying?

1854
01:42:40,400 --> 01:42:43,437
He's been drinking. It's hard to
understand. He's being ridiculous.

1855
01:42:43,640 --> 01:42:46,313
David hired us to help him smuggle
drugs across the border.

1856
01:42:46,520 --> 01:42:47,999
You're drug dealers?

1857
01:42:48,400 --> 01:42:51,358
No! No, we're drug smugglers.
There's a difference.

1858
01:42:51,600 --> 01:42:53,158
There's not a difference.

1859
01:42:53,360 --> 01:42:56,113
Okay, Edie, we can explain, all right?

1860
01:42:56,320 --> 01:42:58,675
This is a small misunderstanding.
It really is.

1861
01:42:58,880 --> 01:43:01,474
When he says "smuggle," he doesn't
know what he's saying.

1862
01:43:01,680 --> 01:43:03,910
- It's not drugs.
- He doesn't know what drugs are.

1863
01:43:04,120 --> 01:43:06,076
Seriously. It's just a little tequila.

1864
01:43:07,480 --> 01:43:08,629
What?

1865
01:43:08,840 --> 01:43:09,875
Oh, my God!

1866
01:43:10,120 --> 01:43:13,795
- Hey. Ah, thank God you're alive.
- He's got a gun!

1867
01:43:14,040 --> 01:43:16,190
Listen! Hey, hey, hey.
No, no! Wait, wait, wait!

1868
01:43:21,960 --> 01:43:23,279
This is gonna be fun!

1869
01:43:35,640 --> 01:43:37,198
I still got it.

1870
01:43:37,400 --> 01:43:39,072
Don's a badass.

1871
01:43:39,800 --> 01:43:41,995
Oh, Don.

1872
01:43:43,880 --> 01:43:45,632
Melissa, go find a police officer.

1873
01:43:47,240 --> 01:43:48,798
Okay, Don. Don, listen to me.

1874
01:43:49,000 --> 01:43:51,389
No. Drug smuggling, David?

1875
01:43:51,600 --> 01:43:53,556
And to think of the
moment we shared.

1876
01:43:53,760 --> 01:43:55,193
No, Don, there's another guy.

1877
01:43:55,720 --> 01:43:57,472
I don't want to hear about other men!

1878
01:43:58,120 --> 01:44:01,510
What? No! No, no! No! There's
another guy trying to kill us!

1879
01:44:01,720 --> 01:44:03,119
What? Who?

1880
01:44:03,320 --> 01:44:04,469
Pablo Chacon.

1881
01:44:05,120 --> 01:44:06,155
Pablo Chacon.

1882
01:44:06,360 --> 01:44:07,475
Buenas noches, Millers.

1883
01:44:07,680 --> 01:44:09,352
What is he saying?
What does that mean?

1884
01:44:09,560 --> 01:44:11,278
It's a familiar Mexican greeting.

1885
01:44:11,480 --> 01:44:14,631
You in the short jeans
and the funny mustache, give me the gun.

1886
01:44:15,920 --> 01:44:17,114
Melissa.

1887
01:44:19,920 --> 01:44:21,069
And the mug.

1888
01:44:24,080 --> 01:44:25,308
Please don't hurt her.

1889
01:44:26,160 --> 01:44:29,038
- Take her.
- Are you okay? It's okay.

1890
01:44:32,720 --> 01:44:33,914
Now the keys, please.

1891
01:44:34,480 --> 01:44:35,595
Here. Here, here, here.

1892
01:44:35,920 --> 01:44:39,151
Okay, great. You have your drugs,
so you don't have to kill us.

1893
01:44:39,360 --> 01:44:41,112
Oh, I don't have to kill you, huh?

1894
01:44:41,360 --> 01:44:42,395
You take my drugs.

1895
01:44:42,600 --> 01:44:45,558
You make me cross the border into
this fucked-up country.

1896
01:44:45,760 --> 01:44:47,910
You try to burn my face with steam!

1897
01:44:48,120 --> 01:44:50,395
- I'm sorry.
- You destroy my car!

1898
01:44:52,240 --> 01:44:55,994
And I don't like what you do to my man
every time we meet.

1899
01:44:58,320 --> 01:45:00,390
You are the worst
family I've ever met.

1900
01:45:02,080 --> 01:45:04,230
But, you're right,
I don't have to kill you.

1901
01:45:06,800 --> 01:45:09,155
I want to kill you. All of you.

1902
01:45:09,560 --> 01:45:11,391
Stop. Stop.

1903
01:45:13,040 --> 01:45:15,918
Don't do this. Don't kill these people.

1904
01:45:17,000 --> 01:45:20,595
This is all my fault. I'm the one that
did this. I'm the drug dealer here.

1905
01:45:20,800 --> 01:45:22,153
This is an innocent family...

1906
01:45:22,360 --> 01:45:24,590
...in the wrong place
at the wrong time. Okay?

1907
01:45:25,920 --> 01:45:27,194
And this kid?

1908
01:45:27,520 --> 01:45:30,637
This kid's got the biggest fucking heart
I've ever seen in my life.

1909
01:45:31,480 --> 01:45:33,118
And I'm lucky to call him a friend.

1910
01:45:33,440 --> 01:45:37,274
Man, an hour ago, I would have killed
this girl for you.

1911
01:45:37,480 --> 01:45:40,597
But she's tough as hell.
And a lot smarter than me.

1912
01:45:41,880 --> 01:45:43,154
And this one.

1913
01:45:44,760 --> 01:45:47,479
You. Sarah.

1914
01:45:48,520 --> 01:45:50,715
You're the strongest woman
I've ever met.

1915
01:45:50,920 --> 01:45:52,672
And you'd make a great mom.

1916
01:45:55,320 --> 01:45:56,833
I love all of them.

1917
01:45:58,920 --> 01:46:00,148
Don't kill them.

1918
01:46:00,720 --> 01:46:01,914
Please.

1919
01:46:03,120 --> 01:46:04,439
Just kill me.

1920
01:46:05,360 --> 01:46:07,794
- Tell you what, I'll make a deal, okay?
- Okay.

1921
01:46:08,040 --> 01:46:10,395
I kill you first so you don't
watch your family die.

1922
01:46:21,480 --> 01:46:22,993
David.

1923
01:46:31,720 --> 01:46:33,551
Kenny! That was amazing!

1924
01:46:40,360 --> 01:46:42,078
I'd like to think I taught him that.

1925
01:46:42,720 --> 01:46:45,314
- Mm.
- I know I taught him that.

1926
01:46:47,120 --> 01:46:49,076
Put that tongue back in your mouth,
young man.

1927
01:46:50,880 --> 01:46:52,108
Oh.

1928
01:46:52,320 --> 01:46:54,151
Wow.

1929
01:46:54,360 --> 01:46:56,874
- You kiss a lot better than my sister.
- Hey!

1930
01:46:59,040 --> 01:47:00,314
- One, two, three.
- Mm-hm.

1931
01:47:09,720 --> 01:47:13,679
Well, Mr. Chacon, on behalf
of the United States of America...

1932
01:47:13,880 --> 01:47:15,916
...I'd like to welcome
you to our country.

1933
01:47:16,120 --> 01:47:17,519
Grab a seat.

1934
01:47:18,560 --> 01:47:20,915
Sorry you won't get to experience
the freedom part.

1935
01:47:21,320 --> 01:47:23,356
Don, you're my hero.

1936
01:47:27,320 --> 01:47:29,151
I want you to use those zip ties tonight.

1937
01:47:43,120 --> 01:47:44,155
Here.

1938
01:47:44,960 --> 01:47:46,234
Thank you, David.

1939
01:47:48,880 --> 01:47:51,155
- We're gonna go.
- Not so fast.

1940
01:47:51,400 --> 01:47:52,594
- Oh, no, Don.
- Dad, please.

1941
01:47:52,800 --> 01:47:54,233
Girls, hush.

1942
01:47:57,040 --> 01:47:58,917
I believe that you are good people.

1943
01:47:59,120 --> 01:48:01,270
But you broke the law. All of you.

1944
01:48:01,560 --> 01:48:04,996
And worse than that, you put my wife
and daughter's lives in danger.

1945
01:48:05,560 --> 01:48:08,393
- Sorry.
- Gonna have to place you under arrest.

1946
01:48:08,600 --> 01:48:09,828
- Don, why?
- No, Dad, don't.

1947
01:48:10,080 --> 01:48:11,513
And I'm gonna do just that...

1948
01:48:12,480 --> 01:48:14,357
...right after I turn around...

1949
01:48:15,280 --> 01:48:16,554
...and hug my family.

1950
01:48:29,160 --> 01:48:30,673
David, come on.

1951
01:48:38,480 --> 01:48:39,674
It's all here!

1952
01:48:40,080 --> 01:48:42,548
I am blown away, David. Great job.

1953
01:48:43,000 --> 01:48:45,150
But it's late.

1954
01:48:45,600 --> 01:48:48,512
Deadline was last night, so,
sorry, buddy, no deal.

1955
01:48:49,480 --> 01:48:52,472
Brad, I almost got killed
over this shit. Twice.

1956
01:48:52,680 --> 01:48:56,468
I'm not gonna be an asshole about this.
I got two tons of premium weed.

1957
01:48:56,840 --> 01:49:00,515
Yes! And you got Chacon
pinched in the process...

1958
01:49:00,760 --> 01:49:03,832
- ... which is a huge win for team Brad.
- Mm-hm.

1959
01:49:04,040 --> 01:49:07,157
So how about we shake hands
and call it even.

1960
01:49:09,920 --> 01:49:13,799
- You were never gonna pay me, were you?
- Oh! Bingo. Heh-heh.

1961
01:49:15,120 --> 01:49:17,350
Was that a dick move?
I can't even tell anymore.

1962
01:49:20,640 --> 01:49:22,392
- Move!
- Go! Go! Go!

1963
01:49:23,240 --> 01:49:24,275
DEA!

1964
01:49:25,200 --> 01:49:27,395
- Down, down, down!
- Get on the ground! Freeze!

1965
01:49:29,560 --> 01:49:31,039
Clear!

1966
01:49:33,320 --> 01:49:34,469
You double-crossed me.

1967
01:49:34,800 --> 01:49:36,358
Kind of a dick move, right?

1968
01:49:37,440 --> 01:49:38,998
You got nothing on me!

1969
01:49:39,280 --> 01:49:40,679
Nothing at all.

1970
01:49:41,680 --> 01:49:44,240
Oh, shit! Look at this guy.

1971
01:49:44,440 --> 01:49:46,317
Who let in 50 Cent?

1972
01:49:47,920 --> 01:49:50,070
- Nice work, David.
- Thank you, Don.

1973
01:49:50,280 --> 01:49:52,316
Now, I know you don't
get your money...

1974
01:49:52,560 --> 01:49:55,677
...but doing the right thing
had to feel a whole lot better.

1975
01:49:56,080 --> 01:49:57,479
No.

1976
01:49:58,080 --> 01:49:59,433
All right, maybe a little bit.

1977
01:49:59,640 --> 01:50:04,077
As promised, in exchange for your
testimony against Chacon and Gurdlinger...

1978
01:50:04,320 --> 01:50:07,551
...we have to keep you in witness protection
for three to six months.

1979
01:50:07,760 --> 01:50:10,194
- Just me?
- Just you.

1980
01:50:12,760 --> 01:50:16,639
Oh. And any other witnesses
to the crime.

1981
01:50:27,480 --> 01:50:29,232
- There you are.
- I don't care.

1982
01:50:29,440 --> 01:50:31,431
- Look at this hot nerd.
- Rub some dirt on it.

1983
01:50:31,680 --> 01:50:33,159
- What are you doing?
- Look at this.

1984
01:50:35,786 --> 01:50:38,100
You gotta tell Casey
to stop posting this stuff.

1985
01:50:38,425 --> 01:50:40,991
It's already got a million hits...
... and growing.

1986
01:50:41,751 --> 01:50:43,918
Okay, okay, I'll tell her after lunch.
Oof, you know what else?

1987
01:50:44,120 --> 01:50:45,678
I can see down your tank top.

1988
01:50:52,440 --> 01:50:53,509
- Hey there.
- Hey.

1989
01:50:53,720 --> 01:50:56,792
- Wanted to introduce ourselves. I'm Dan.
- Hey, Dan.

1990
01:50:57,040 --> 01:50:58,871
My wife, Kathy. We just moved in.

1991
01:50:59,320 --> 01:51:00,673
- Hello.
- We're the Johnsons.

1992
01:51:00,920 --> 01:51:02,990
Oh, great.
Welcome to the neighborhood.

1993
01:51:03,440 --> 01:51:04,953
Hey, guys. Come here.

1994
01:51:05,160 --> 01:51:06,275
Come meet our neighbors.

1995
01:51:06,480 --> 01:51:07,515
I'm David.

1996
01:51:07,920 --> 01:51:09,876
And this is my family right here.

1997
01:51:10,040 --> 01:51:11,268
This is my son, Kenny.

1998
01:51:11,440 --> 01:51:12,634
My daughter, Casey.

1999
01:51:12,800 --> 01:51:15,314
- And this is my wife, Sarah.
- Nice to meet you.

2000
01:51:15,520 --> 01:51:18,034
- We're the Millers.
- Ah. Pleasure.

2001
01:51:18,200 --> 01:51:20,555
Thanks for saying hi.
All right, take care now.

2002
01:51:20,720 --> 01:51:22,597
- See you soon. Bye.
- Bye.

2003
01:51:22,920 --> 01:51:25,115
- I don't like them.
- I don't like them either.

2004
01:51:25,320 --> 01:51:27,709
Why introduce yourself?
I mean, who the fuck are you?

2005
01:51:27,880 --> 01:51:30,872
I can't believe this.
We're stuck in the suburbs.

2006
01:51:31,040 --> 01:51:35,033
Now, this sucks. I can't wait for the
trial to be over. Gotta get outta here.

2007
01:51:40,400 --> 01:51:41,435
Stick to the big A.

2008
01:51:41,600 --> 01:51:43,158
- Anal.
- Abstinence, you meant.

2009
01:51:43,320 --> 01:51:45,117
- Neither makes a baby.
- He confuses...

2010
01:51:45,280 --> 01:51:47,953
Oscars! For all of you!

2011
01:51:48,120 --> 01:51:51,112
That's very nice of you, but we're
not that good of an actor, no.

2012
01:51:54,600 --> 01:51:56,875
- Those guys are picking on that girl.
- Where?

2013
01:51:59,520 --> 01:52:01,556
- I'll never forget these moments.
- What?

2014
01:52:01,720 --> 01:52:04,188
- And I hope you don't either.
- Ha-ha-ha.

2015
01:52:04,640 --> 01:52:05,868
And, action.

2016
01:52:08,040 --> 01:52:09,951
It takes two men to open this
mini-fridge.

2017
01:52:10,520 --> 01:52:12,556
Aah!

2018
01:52:12,720 --> 01:52:16,599
It's literally so hard!

2019
01:52:17,800 --> 01:52:20,030
- Okay, you guys, seriously, you're mak...
- Ha-ha-ha!

2020
01:52:20,440 --> 01:52:21,475
Look, look, look.

2021
01:52:22,960 --> 01:52:24,757
- Ha, ha!
- Leave the girls alone.

2022
01:52:24,960 --> 01:52:28,077
What are you gonna do, freckles?
What are you gonna do, Don Knotts?

2023
01:52:28,240 --> 01:52:30,310
What are you gonna do,
guy with great posture?

2024
01:52:32,640 --> 01:52:34,790
Ow! Broke my nose!

2025
01:52:35,160 --> 01:52:37,390
I'm terrified of blood,
you know what I'm saying?

2026
01:52:37,760 --> 01:52:40,672
You just deviated my septum,
you know what I'm saying?

2027
01:52:40,840 --> 01:52:44,276
Uh, I want a Band-Aid.

2028
01:52:45,680 --> 01:52:47,750
- Closed?
- They're closed. Till morning.

2029
01:52:47,920 --> 01:52:50,388
Oklahoma.
Oh, poop.

2030
01:52:50,560 --> 01:52:52,630
Cheese and rice.
Ants on a log.

2031
01:52:52,800 --> 01:52:55,109
Poop on a popsicle.
Oh, cock marbles.

2032
01:52:55,280 --> 01:52:58,158
- Oh, fuck.
- Ha-ha-ha.

2033
01:53:12,800 --> 01:53:15,439
It just stopped at a certain point...

2034
01:53:15,640 --> 01:53:18,029
...and you just couldn't
insert it any more.

2035
01:53:18,200 --> 01:53:21,351
Well, I just looked like I had,
like, a Stormtrooper dick.

2036
01:53:24,800 --> 01:53:27,837
So I'm just gonna... There we go.
There they are.

2037
01:53:28,000 --> 01:53:29,069
This is crazy.

2038
01:53:29,280 --> 01:53:32,352
Those are just gorgeous, gorgeous,
gorgeous breasts.

2039
01:53:34,880 --> 01:53:36,552
Cut! All right. Cut.

2040
01:53:37,200 --> 01:53:38,918
- And, action.
- Whoo!

2041
01:53:39,674 --> 01:53:42,103
- How about a little victory music,
shall we? - Yes, please.

2042
01:53:45,160 --> 01:53:46,798
- I love this song!
- This is awesome!

2043
01:53:50,360 --> 01:53:55,115
You're job's a joke, you're broke
Your love life's D. O.A.

2044
01:53:55,280 --> 01:53:58,272
I'll be there for you

2045
01:53:58,440 --> 01:53:59,953
When the rain starts to fall

2046
01:54:00,120 --> 01:54:03,271
I'll be there for you

2047
01:54:03,480 --> 01:54:05,994
'Cause you're there for me too

2048
01:54:06,160 --> 01:54:08,515
That was really good.

2049
01:54:10,440 --> 01:54:12,670
That's very funny.

2050
01:58:23,160 --> 01:58:25,196
Adiós, Millers.

2051
