1
00:02:09,662 --> 00:02:12,199
All is here for the vacancy
to the quality department.

2
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,139
Have you worked somewhere earlier?

3
00:02:28,114 --> 00:02:29,149
Do you want to hear a joke?

4
00:02:30,383 --> 00:02:32,226
Once a man was
drowning in the river.

5
00:02:33,019 --> 00:02:37,092
He yelled,
"Lord Ganesha, please save me!"

6
00:02:37,157 --> 00:02:38,602
Lord Ganesha started dancing.

7
00:02:38,658 --> 00:02:41,502
The man asked,
"Why are You dancing?"

8
00:02:41,561 --> 00:02:46,010
So, Lord Ganesha said, "Didn't you
dance while immersing me in water?"

9
00:02:49,102 --> 00:02:52,675
Actually, I shouldn't be cracking
jokes about God in front of God.

10
00:02:52,739 --> 00:02:55,481
I'm sorry.
Don't mind, but I have no mind.

11
00:02:55,542 --> 00:02:57,112
Give my ball.

12
00:02:58,678 --> 00:03:01,591
Hurry up! Quick.

13
00:03:01,648 --> 00:03:03,252
Kids, are you okay?

14
00:03:14,093 --> 00:03:15,333
Hey, mister!

15
00:03:15,395 --> 00:03:17,068
Hello. Yes, you.

16
00:03:17,764 --> 00:03:19,141
Aren't there enough
potholes in the city..

17
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:20,405
“that you've dug up another one?

18
00:03:20,466 --> 00:03:21,968
And for the past two weeks.

19
00:03:23,203 --> 00:03:25,706
Those kids and my
God were saved today.

20
00:03:26,506 --> 00:03:28,611
Why are you so irresponsible?

21
00:03:28,675 --> 00:03:30,154
The next time,
someone might lose his life...

22
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:31,621
...because of these potholes.

23
00:03:32,779 --> 00:03:34,520
But whether someone lives or dies...

24
00:03:34,581 --> 00:03:36,117
...it doesn't matter to you.

25
00:03:36,182 --> 00:03:37,354
Don't worry, madam.

26
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:40,230
You'll have no complaints
against us henceforth.

27
00:03:40,286 --> 00:03:41,026
Okay.

28
00:03:41,554 --> 00:03:42,589
Let's see.

29
00:03:44,657 --> 00:03:45,658
I-Ii!

30
00:03:46,659 --> 00:03:48,969
I just wanted to send
this message across that...

31
00:03:49,395 --> 00:03:50,738
...I'm proud of you.

32
00:03:51,631 --> 00:03:57,081
I'm sure that whatever you
do in life will be right for you.

33
00:03:58,438 --> 00:04:00,315
No matter how many
obstacles you face...

34
00:04:01,307 --> 00:04:03,014
...there won't be darkness anymore.

35
00:04:22,061 --> 00:04:22,562
Hello.

36
00:04:22,629 --> 00:04:24,472
Do you want to listen to the
bad news first or the worst news?

37
00:04:25,632 --> 00:04:27,134
The bad news is that you'll
have to live without me every day...

38
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:28,975
...between 9 to 5 from now on.

39
00:04:29,302 --> 00:04:31,009
And the worst news
is that I won't be able...

40
00:04:31,070 --> 00:04:32,981
...to live without you
every day between 9 to 5.

41
00:04:34,274 --> 00:04:35,548
I got the job, Aisha.

42
00:04:36,476 --> 00:04:37,477
I got the job.

43
00:04:38,144 --> 00:04:41,250
Now go and erase that
wish from your diary.

44
00:04:42,248 --> 00:04:43,318
I've become independent.

45
00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:44,721
Guru...

46
00:04:46,352 --> 00:04:48,093
...there's something
that I have to say to you.

47
00:04:49,022 --> 00:04:49,727
Tell me.

48
00:04:50,690 --> 00:04:52,226
No, come home first.

49
00:04:52,292 --> 00:04:54,238
Tell me. I'm on my way home.

50
00:04:54,294 --> 00:04:55,671
No, come home.

51
00:04:57,797 --> 00:04:58,502
Hello.

52
00:05:00,266 --> 00:05:01,210
How did you get in?

53
00:05:01,634 --> 00:05:02,237
Aisha?

54
00:05:03,169 --> 00:05:04,045
What are you doing?

55
00:05:04,404 --> 00:05:04,677
Who is“

56
00:05:04,737 --> 00:05:06,944
Does anyone barge into someone's house
like that without ringing the bell!

57
00:05:07,006 --> 00:05:08,314
Get out of here. Get out!

58
00:05:11,644 --> 00:05:13,089
Aisha, who is it? What happened?

59
00:05:13,746 --> 00:05:14,986
Aisha!

60
00:05:15,448 --> 00:05:16,449
Aisha, who is it?

61
00:05:17,383 --> 00:05:19,124
Aisha, listen to me! Police!

62
00:05:19,652 --> 00:05:21,689
Aisha! Listen! Hey! - Guru!

63
00:05:22,021 --> 00:05:24,501
Listen, you've enmity with me.

64
00:05:24,557 --> 00:05:27,197
Look.. spare her.

65
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:31,640
You have a problem with me.
Listen. Spare her.

66
00:05:31,698 --> 00:05:34,076
Guru!
- Hey, stop. Let my Aisha go!

67
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:40,242
Please! No!

68
00:05:49,415 --> 00:05:51,019
Please don't kill me.

69
00:05:56,689 --> 00:05:59,966
Please don't kill me. Please.

70
00:07:26,345 --> 00:07:27,653
Who is in charge of this area?

71
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:29,516
I am. Inspector Waghle.

72
00:07:30,416 --> 00:07:31,986
Aditya Rathore, CBI.

73
00:07:32,752 --> 00:07:36,131
But why is the CBI so keen
on the murder of an ordinary girl?

74
00:07:37,089 --> 00:07:41,367
lam keen not on this girl,
but her love.

75
00:07:42,028 --> 00:07:43,234
I didn't get you.

76
00:07:43,729 --> 00:07:47,040
We'll have to find Aisha's
murderer at the earliest.

77
00:07:47,733 --> 00:07:49,303
If he sets out to look for him...

78
00:07:50,069 --> 00:07:52,481
...then the government will
have to find some new property.

79
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:55,710
Guru will kill so many...

80
00:07:55,775 --> 00:07:58,449
...that there won't be enough
place to cremate the bodies.

81
00:08:05,952 --> 00:08:09,627
'Devil. Monster. Demon. Beast.'

82
00:08:10,156 --> 00:08:12,602
'Who says that only
God has several names?'

83
00:08:14,994 --> 00:08:16,974
'Demons are found in hell.'

84
00:08:18,030 --> 00:08:21,443
'But I met one such demon
in the so-called paradise in Goa.'

85
00:08:24,971 --> 00:08:26,951
'But demons possess
a special quality.'

86
00:08:28,007 --> 00:08:30,453
'It's his habit to be
present at his own funeral.'

87
00:08:31,143 --> 00:08:32,645
'Hatred is his weapon.'

88
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:35,215
'Anger is his explosive.'

89
00:08:35,648 --> 00:08:37,457
'He doesn't know
what sympathy means.'

90
00:08:38,017 --> 00:08:39,496
'No one loves him.'

91
00:08:40,453 --> 00:08:42,399
'Every love story has a hero...'

92
00:08:43,022 --> 00:08:43,966
...a heroine...'

93
00:08:44,223 --> 00:08:45,258
'...and a villain.'

94
00:08:49,395 --> 00:08:52,467
'But this love story
is of a villain.'

95
00:08:56,435 --> 00:08:58,039
Please forgive me, Guru.

96
00:08:58,404 --> 00:08:59,712
I made a mistake, Guru.

97
00:09:01,474 --> 00:09:02,316
What are you doing?

98
00:09:03,042 --> 00:09:04,487
Guru, please forgive me.

99
00:09:04,544 --> 00:09:07,923
I beg of you, Gurul Please spare me.

100
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:09,982
I beg of you. Don't do this!
For God's sake, spare me life.

101
00:09:12,051 --> 00:09:13,394
Are you Pfﬂymg?

102
00:09:14,053 --> 00:09:14,929
Guru, please forgive me.

103
00:09:14,987 --> 00:09:17,365
Do you really think that
He will appear to save you?

104
00:09:23,362 --> 00:09:24,238
Fine.

105
00:09:27,199 --> 00:09:28,109
Pray.

106
00:09:28,467 --> 00:09:30,208
No! Guru.

107
00:09:31,437 --> 00:09:34,043
You have time until
this matchstick is put out.

108
00:09:36,008 --> 00:09:37,180
Remember your God.

109
00:09:37,243 --> 00:09:37,687
Rohan

110
00:09:38,010 --> 00:09:40,490
What are you doing? What happened?

111
00:09:40,546 --> 00:09:42,048
What are you doing, son?

112
00:09:42,448 --> 00:09:43,324
Rohan.

113
00:09:43,382 --> 00:09:45,020
Rohan.

114
00:09:45,084 --> 00:09:48,031
Mother, I'll kill him!
- Don't do this!

115
00:09:48,087 --> 00:09:50,124
Please stop.

116
00:09:50,189 --> 00:09:52,601
CBI People beat me up a lot.

117
00:09:53,192 --> 00:09:55,297
Raghu. Please save me, o God.

118
00:09:56,195 --> 00:09:57,173
Rahull Rahul, no.

119
00:09:57,229 --> 00:09:58,037
Help.

120
00:09:58,097 --> 00:09:58,973
Can I give you a suggestion?

121
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:01,400
Don't pray to God.

122
00:10:02,435 --> 00:10:03,277
Pray to the breeze.

123
00:10:04,503 --> 00:10:07,541
Because if there's breeze,
you'll be finished.

124
00:10:07,607 --> 00:10:12,078
No, no! Guru, please...
I made a mistake.

125
00:10:12,144 --> 00:10:13,680
No, no! Guru, what are you doing?

126
00:10:14,013 --> 00:10:16,220
Guru, please don't do this!
I beg of you!

127
00:10:16,282 --> 00:10:18,353
No, Guru! Guru...

128
00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:23,523
No, Rohan.
- No, leave me.

129
00:10:23,589 --> 00:10:25,091
Guru!

130
00:10:25,157 --> 00:10:27,296
Spare me, Guru.

131
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:30,307
Guru! Guru! No.

132
00:10:30,363 --> 00:10:31,603
Guru! Spare me, Guru.

133
00:10:31,664 --> 00:10:33,735
Spare me. Guru.

134
00:10:33,799 --> 00:10:35,972
Let go of me!
- Let go off.

135
00:10:36,335 --> 00:10:38,406
Guru, no.

136
00:10:38,471 --> 00:10:40,747
Let go of me! Guru, let go of rne!

137
00:10:40,806 --> 00:10:42,308
Please let go of rne!

138
00:10:42,375 --> 00:10:44,719
Fine. I'll let go of you!

139
00:10:48,547 --> 00:10:50,151
Brother.

140
00:10:50,816 --> 00:10:54,730
No! No!

141
00:11:02,028 --> 00:11:05,407
No!

142
00:11:05,464 --> 00:11:07,410
No!

143
00:11:15,174 --> 00:11:17,677
Come out.

144
00:11:18,110 --> 00:11:20,613
Come on! Take him out.

145
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:22,682
Will you kill him? Leave.

146
00:11:23,115 --> 00:11:25,026
Come on.

147
00:11:36,095 --> 00:11:39,167
Tell me! Who is your boss!

148
00:11:39,231 --> 00:11:41,302
Who do you work for!

149
00:11:41,367 --> 00:11:43,404
Has Singh sir sent you?

150
00:11:43,469 --> 00:11:46,507
Torture him.
Tell me about his business.

151
00:11:46,572 --> 00:11:49,382
Hold him light.
All of you will be punished.

152
00:11:50,076 --> 00:11:51,714
Hey, tell me.

153
00:11:52,044 --> 00:11:54,285
Come on.

154
00:12:04,356 --> 00:12:07,701
Ready, steady, smile!

155
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:09,967
Okay. A joke.

156
00:12:10,029 --> 00:12:12,475
A woman went to the police
station and asked the inspector...

157
00:12:12,531 --> 00:12:15,512
"Inspector,
my husband had gone to the market..."

158
00:12:15,568 --> 00:12:16,546
"...to buy okra two days ago."

159
00:12:16,602 --> 00:12:18,172
"He hasn't come back yet."

160
00:12:18,237 --> 00:12:21,184
The inspector said,
"What's the big deal, madam?"

161
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:23,686
"Cook some other vegetable."

162
00:12:25,311 --> 00:12:28,554
Wonderful! - Thank you.

163
00:12:31,083 --> 00:12:32,460
Hey, come on.

164
00:12:32,518 --> 00:12:34,657
What is the press doing outside?

165
00:12:35,354 --> 00:12:37,664
So that your photos are
published in the newspaper...

166
00:12:37,723 --> 00:12:40,670
...and people come to know
that you are the officer...

167
00:12:40,726 --> 00:12:44,333
...who forbade an adult girl from
getting married against her will.

168
00:12:44,396 --> 00:12:46,706
You're interfering in other people's
lives! Don't you have any shame?

169
00:12:46,766 --> 00:12:48,040
Sheela is an adult.

170
00:12:48,701 --> 00:12:50,476
And she came to me for help.

171
00:12:51,203 --> 00:12:53,410
All of you treat her like a maid...

172
00:12:53,472 --> 00:12:55,076
...who is only supposed
to do the household chores...

173
00:12:55,141 --> 00:12:56,449
...and look after children.

174
00:12:56,509 --> 00:12:58,284
When she demands to be happy...

175
00:12:58,344 --> 00:13:00,153
...all of you have a problem with it.

176
00:13:01,013 --> 00:13:03,050
While trying to belong
to a particular religion...

177
00:13:03,516 --> 00:13:05,052
...you have forgotten
to be a human being.

178
00:13:05,384 --> 00:13:07,694
Get aside. Move“ move.

179
00:13:07,753 --> 00:13:08,697
Out. out from here.

180
00:13:09,054 --> 00:13:11,227
Sharad, drive her out.

181
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:31,078
Because of your boss Caesar,
three officers of mine were killed.

182
00:13:31,644 --> 00:13:35,387
The officers that
were doing their duty.

183
00:13:40,019 --> 00:13:41,726
But I give you a chance.

184
00:13:42,021 --> 00:13:44,695
I will make you my pet dog.

185
00:13:45,558 --> 00:13:48,562
I will ask Deepu's
mother to testify...

186
00:13:48,627 --> 00:13:53,167
...that her son accidentally
fell in the fire in a drunken state.

187
00:13:53,499 --> 00:13:55,501
And being my pet dog...

188
00:13:56,468 --> 00:14:00,507
...you will wag your tail
and take me to your boss Caesar.

189
00:14:02,708 --> 00:14:04,346
It's your decision now.

190
00:14:05,144 --> 00:14:06,623
You changed sides, didn't you?

191
00:14:08,547 --> 00:14:10,959
She didn't testify against me.

192
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:14,094
That's the reason
why you're barking!

193
00:14:15,354 --> 00:14:16,628
Will you speak up?

194
00:14:17,590 --> 00:14:20,935
I will avenge Caesar for
killing my men at any cost.

195
00:14:22,061 --> 00:14:24,667
I will make your condition
so miserable in prison...

196
00:14:25,331 --> 00:14:27,277
...that you'll yearn for death.

197
00:14:27,333 --> 00:14:29,609
People fear death.

198
00:14:30,469 --> 00:14:33,109
But I face death each day.

199
00:14:34,106 --> 00:14:36,017
As an uninvited guest.

200
00:14:36,775 --> 00:14:38,254
Acting over smart.

201
00:14:42,181 --> 00:14:44,559
You'll pay the price
for this insanity, Guru.

202
00:14:45,551 --> 00:14:47,462
This is not insanity. It's manhood.

203
00:14:52,658 --> 00:14:55,161
Lawyer, give the bail paper quickly.

204
00:15:07,439 --> 00:15:08,474
Arjun.

205
00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:09,348
ls everything alright?

206
00:15:13,512 --> 00:15:14,650
Hey, listen!

207
00:15:14,713 --> 00:15:17,159
Hey! Do you want to hear a joke?

208
00:15:17,216 --> 00:15:19,560
Once a thief got
into a house to steal.

209
00:15:20,252 --> 00:15:23,028
The safe read, "There is
no need to break open this safe."

210
00:15:23,088 --> 00:15:25,034
"Press 1,2,3 and then the red button."

211
00:15:25,090 --> 00:15:26,364
"The safe will open."

212
00:15:27,026 --> 00:15:28,437
As soon as the thief
pressed the button...

213
00:15:28,494 --> 00:15:30,565
...the alarm rang and
the police came there.

214
00:15:30,629 --> 00:15:33,235
While leaving,
the thief told the owner...

215
00:15:33,299 --> 00:15:35,643
"l have lost faith
in humanity today."

216
00:15:38,237 --> 00:15:39,511
Hey!

217
00:15:40,572 --> 00:15:42,574
The joke was not that bad.

218
00:15:43,042 --> 00:15:44,385
You could have at least smiled.

219
00:15:45,177 --> 00:15:47,623
Listen. I need you
to do something for me.

220
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:48,590
You don't have to rob a safe.

221
00:15:49,682 --> 00:15:51,559
Someone needs to be kidnapped.

222
00:15:51,617 --> 00:15:52,459
Will you do it?

223
00:15:53,652 --> 00:15:55,996
I'm not asking you
to do it for free.

224
00:15:56,055 --> 00:15:57,090
I'll pay You-

225
00:15:57,156 --> 00:15:58,499
Show me your rate card.

226
00:15:58,557 --> 00:16:00,195
I would have done it myself.

227
00:16:00,459 --> 00:16:02,496
But just as we go
to a saloon to shave...

228
00:16:02,561 --> 00:16:04,199
...and to a tailor
to get clothes stitched...

229
00:16:04,263 --> 00:16:06,504
...similarly, won't we go
to a goon to get someone kidnapped?

230
00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:10,442
Because you look like a villain.

231
00:16:17,509 --> 00:16:18,647
Hey, villain!

232
00:16:21,013 --> 00:16:22,321
Smile!

233
00:16:25,517 --> 00:16:28,589
Come on.

234
00:16:29,621 --> 00:16:31,294
Sahiba! Guru!

235
00:16:31,357 --> 00:16:32,961
Wait. wait.

236
00:16:36,128 --> 00:16:37,698
Pass the ball. Quick.

237
00:16:38,030 --> 00:16:40,135
I sent you thereto kill.

238
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:42,338
Not to get killed.

239
00:16:46,672 --> 00:16:51,553
I know that you're
not too fond of living.

240
00:16:51,610 --> 00:16:56,059
But your life is priceless for me.
Priceless.

241
00:16:58,684 --> 00:17:00,493
God blessed me with you.

242
00:17:01,153 --> 00:17:02,598
You're my son.

243
00:17:02,654 --> 00:17:05,157
You mean more than a son to me.

244
00:17:06,058 --> 00:17:09,562
Stop looking for excuses to die.

245
00:17:09,628 --> 00:17:11,437
Look for a reason to live.

246
00:17:11,497 --> 00:17:12,976
Caesar.

247
00:17:13,032 --> 00:17:14,534
Caesar.

248
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:16,511
Caesar.

249
00:17:16,568 --> 00:17:17,478
I know him.

250
00:17:17,970 --> 00:17:18,914
You're too much.

251
00:17:19,271 --> 00:17:19,681
Don't you understand?

252
00:17:19,738 --> 00:17:20,307
Hey!

253
00:17:20,372 --> 00:17:21,214
How many times do I tell you?

254
00:17:21,273 --> 00:17:22,115
Hey, villain!

255
00:17:22,174 --> 00:17:23,016
Madam, you can't go in.

256
00:17:23,075 --> 00:17:24,679
I know him. Let me go.

257
00:17:25,411 --> 00:17:26,412
Hey, villain!

258
00:17:27,312 --> 00:17:30,225
Yes! See, I told you I know him.

259
00:17:30,282 --> 00:17:30,692
I-Ii!

260
00:17:31,016 --> 00:17:32,586
As all of you already know...

261
00:17:32,651 --> 00:17:36,121
...Mr. Caesar has done
a lot for the people.

262
00:17:36,188 --> 00:17:37,394
Villain!

263
00:17:37,656 --> 00:17:40,136
I'll scream even louder
if you don't come here.

264
00:17:40,492 --> 00:17:42,563
Hey! Come here!

265
00:17:42,628 --> 00:17:44,437
Yes. See, he's coming.

266
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:46,300
I told you...

267
00:17:46,365 --> 00:17:49,574
Let go of my hand!
Why are you holding my hand?

268
00:17:50,436 --> 00:17:53,474
You have no idea
what I can do to you.

269
00:17:55,007 --> 00:17:57,487
It won't take me too
long to dispose your body.

270
00:17:58,143 --> 00:18:01,283
Slop following me and leave.

271
00:18:09,088 --> 00:18:10,499
Wow!

272
00:18:12,224 --> 00:18:15,000
This is why I want to hire you.

273
00:18:16,595 --> 00:18:19,974
I know you're not the romantic kind.

274
00:18:20,566 --> 00:18:22,671
You're the kind that
would shoot someone on sight.

275
00:18:23,001 --> 00:18:24,173
Get lost!

276
00:18:27,072 --> 00:18:29,245
I'm sorry. Cool it.

277
00:18:30,275 --> 00:18:31,686
Listen. You'll kill me...

278
00:18:32,010 --> 00:18:33,683
...and unnecessarily and
go to prison free of cost.

279
00:18:34,046 --> 00:18:35,184
The way I'm paying you,
if someone had paid you...

280
00:18:35,247 --> 00:18:37,454
...to kill me, then it was worth it.

281
00:18:37,516 --> 00:18:39,587
But who would pay to kill me?
I'm so cute.

282
00:18:39,651 --> 00:18:41,324
Do you suffer from
a talking disorder?

283
00:18:41,386 --> 00:18:43,366
I suffer from a lot of disorders.
Forget about that.

284
00:18:43,422 --> 00:18:46,096
Tell me. Will you do it for me?

285
00:18:46,725 --> 00:18:47,965
Please say yes.

286
00:18:48,527 --> 00:18:50,370
Never refuse money.

287
00:18:57,703 --> 00:19:00,411
We're going on such
an important mission...

288
00:19:00,472 --> 00:19:03,009
...but we don't even
know each other's names.

289
00:19:03,075 --> 00:19:03,644
I'm Aisha.

290
00:19:05,978 --> 00:19:06,888
Guru.

291
00:19:08,947 --> 00:19:10,893
Why are you so rude?

292
00:19:11,950 --> 00:19:13,054
Just as it's compulsory
for Superman to wear...

293
00:19:13,118 --> 00:19:14,597
...red underwear over his costume...

294
00:19:14,653 --> 00:19:17,065
...is it compulsory
for gangsters to be rude?

295
00:19:17,356 --> 00:19:19,199
You don't laugh or smile.

296
00:19:19,258 --> 00:19:20,965
You don't even shave or bathe.

297
00:19:22,427 --> 00:19:23,929
I know what you are.

298
00:19:24,730 --> 00:19:25,936
Angry bird.

299
00:19:26,231 --> 00:19:28,211
The game is inspired by you. Yes.

300
00:19:32,604 --> 00:19:34,106
Like this“

301
00:19:34,173 --> 00:19:36,244
Are you crazy or the one
who has to be kidnapped is crazy?

302
00:19:36,308 --> 00:19:37,616
I'm not crazy.

303
00:19:37,976 --> 00:19:40,422
It's Chhotu who's crazy,
just like a depressed lover.

304
00:19:40,479 --> 00:19:43,085
That's why his family
got him admitted here.

305
00:19:43,148 --> 00:19:45,185
They left him alone
and are settled in America.

306
00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:46,524
Do you know what
they told the doctor?

307
00:19:46,585 --> 00:19:47,655
That he's insane.

308
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:50,557
If I don't help him,
then he'll really go insane.

309
00:19:51,557 --> 00:19:52,365
That's why...

310
00:19:53,592 --> 00:19:54,570
We'll have to save him.

311
00:20:00,065 --> 00:20:01,305
These are coins.
- Yes.

312
00:20:03,035 --> 00:20:04,070
Do you want to hear a joke?

313
00:20:04,136 --> 00:20:05,513
Let it be.
- Once... - I'll take the coins.

314
00:20:07,272 --> 00:20:10,412
By the way,
you'll have to fight a few people.

315
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:12,655
You might get hurt.

316
00:20:14,213 --> 00:20:16,250
If it was dancing,
I would have gone to a dancer.

317
00:20:16,582 --> 00:20:19,222
But it's action.
That's why I had to come to you.

318
00:20:19,551 --> 00:20:22,327
Because you are“ a villain!

319
00:20:24,556 --> 00:20:27,366
Hey! Stop!

320
00:20:27,426 --> 00:20:27,733
I'm stuck up here.

321
00:20:28,026 --> 00:20:31,007
Each day should be like that.
This is fun.

322
00:20:31,263 --> 00:20:33,607
Sometimes the players win,
and sometimes they lose.

323
00:20:34,166 --> 00:20:36,544
But the dealer is always profiting.

324
00:20:54,119 --> 00:20:55,655
Who are you?

325
00:21:00,125 --> 00:21:02,332
I'm your father by relation.

326
00:21:04,396 --> 00:21:05,636
My name is Shehanshah.

327
00:21:05,697 --> 00:21:07,699
Shehanshah.

328
00:21:17,042 --> 00:21:17,986
Where's Chhotu?

329
00:21:18,777 --> 00:21:19,983
Where's Chhotu?

330
00:21:26,585 --> 00:21:27,996
Chhotu, come with me.

331
00:21:29,321 --> 00:21:31,028
Come on, Chhotu.

332
00:21:32,057 --> 00:21:36,301
Chhotu!
- Aisha! Aisha! Aisha!

333
00:21:37,162 --> 00:21:38,539
You're getting married, Chhotu!

334
00:21:38,597 --> 00:21:40,076
Really?
- Yes!

335
00:21:40,098 --> 00:21:42,271
Chhotu is going to get married.

336
00:21:42,367 --> 00:21:44,369
Chhotu is going to get married.

337
00:21:45,237 --> 00:21:49,185
"My life is in search
of its destination."

338
00:21:49,241 --> 00:21:52,984
"ls this my destination?"

339
00:21:53,278 --> 00:22:01,026
"Why does my heart
say that I must halt here?"

340
00:22:01,086 --> 00:22:04,966
"l have found new emotions."

341
00:22:05,023 --> 00:22:08,596
"What kind of an effect is this?"

342
00:22:09,061 --> 00:22:13,009
"I've found hope again."

343
00:22:13,065 --> 00:22:16,706
"Someone has accepted it."

344
00:22:18,036 --> 00:22:19,709
Where are you going, son?

345
00:22:19,771 --> 00:22:21,580
Stay till the wedding.

346
00:22:22,007 --> 00:22:24,180
I didn't even get
the chance to thank you.

347
00:22:28,046 --> 00:22:32,688
"Like the poem of a poet..."

348
00:22:32,751 --> 00:22:36,722
"...that calms one's mind."

349
00:22:36,788 --> 00:22:40,668
"I've found someone -.

350
00:22:40,726 --> 00:22:44,196
"...just as a wanderer
finds shelter."

351
00:22:44,730 --> 00:22:48,507
"Like the arrival of a new season."

352
00:22:48,567 --> 00:22:52,174
"Or afternoons in winter."

353
00:22:52,671 --> 00:22:56,619
"I've found someone -.

354
00:22:56,675 --> 00:23:00,088
"...just as a wanderer
finds shelter."

355
00:23:16,161 --> 00:23:17,265
Sorry.

356
00:23:20,365 --> 00:23:22,038
Did she kidnap all of them?

357
00:23:22,701 --> 00:23:23,475
No.

358
00:23:23,535 --> 00:23:24,639
'Blessing your name.'

359
00:23:24,703 --> 00:23:25,681
In fact, she has helped them.

360
00:23:26,004 --> 00:23:27,039
'Where the..'

361
00:23:27,105 --> 00:23:29,483
Being her father,
I couldn't get her married.

362
00:23:29,741 --> 00:23:31,345
But just wait and watch.

363
00:23:31,676 --> 00:23:34,213
She will get all
of them married today.

364
00:23:52,130 --> 00:23:55,168
"Just as a shore..."

365
00:23:56,168 --> 00:23:59,240
"...helps a person relax."

366
00:23:59,304 --> 00:24:05,516
"I've found her at
a juncture in life."

367
00:24:08,146 --> 00:24:11,218
"Just as a star in the sky..."

368
00:24:11,716 --> 00:24:14,993
"...spreads light."

369
00:24:15,053 --> 00:24:21,334
"She spreads light in the city."

370
00:24:23,361 --> 00:24:27,070
"I've forgotten my sorrow."

371
00:24:27,132 --> 00:24:30,705
"What kind of an effect is this?"

372
00:24:31,403 --> 00:24:37,945
"She is teaching me to live again."

373
00:24:39,478 --> 00:24:43,688
"Just as the rains spread joy..."

374
00:24:43,748 --> 00:24:47,423
"...or an ointment soothes the pain."

375
00:24:48,019 --> 00:24:51,694
"I've found someone -.

376
00:24:51,756 --> 00:24:55,260
"...just as a wanderer
finds shelter."

377
00:24:55,694 --> 00:24:59,642
"Like the arrival of a new season."

378
00:24:59,698 --> 00:25:03,168
"Or afternoons in winter."

379
00:25:03,735 --> 00:25:07,615
"I've found someone -.

380
00:25:07,672 --> 00:25:11,142
"...just as a wanderer
finds shelter." - Smile.

381
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:22,396
Mister!

382
00:25:22,454 --> 00:25:23,455
Yes, madam.

383
00:25:23,522 --> 00:25:24,557
The wedding is today.

384
00:25:25,390 --> 00:25:26,198
Please hurry up.

385
00:25:26,258 --> 00:25:27,202
Yes, I'm doing it.

386
00:25:43,141 --> 00:25:44,347
Ouch!

387
00:25:47,379 --> 00:25:50,189
"The smiling face..."

388
00:25:51,349 --> 00:25:54,353
'...acts as a shield."

389
00:25:54,419 --> 00:26:00,392
"l wonder what's
hidden in the heart."

390
00:26:03,361 --> 00:26:10,279
"She shadows the others..."

391
00:26:10,335 --> 00:26:16,911
"...while she stands under the sun."

392
00:26:18,710 --> 00:26:21,247
"She is hurt..."

393
00:26:21,313 --> 00:26:26,126
"...but why do I feel the pain?"

394
00:26:26,518 --> 00:26:33,333
"What does my heart intend to do?"

395
00:26:35,193 --> 00:26:38,504
"l was like a restless bird."

396
00:26:39,130 --> 00:26:43,101
"l was wandering."

397
00:26:43,168 --> 00:26:47,014
"I've found someone -.

398
00:26:47,072 --> 00:26:50,417
"...just as a wanderer
finds shelter."

399
00:26:51,009 --> 00:26:54,980
"Like the arrival of a new season."

400
00:26:55,046 --> 00:26:58,516
"Or afternoons in winter."

401
00:26:59,050 --> 00:27:02,657
"I've found someone -.

402
00:27:02,988 --> 00:27:06,629
"...just as a wanderer
finds shelter."

403
00:27:06,691 --> 00:27:10,605
"Just as a wanderer finds shelter."

404
00:27:10,662 --> 00:27:14,633
"Just as a wanderer finds shelter."

405
00:27:14,699 --> 00:27:18,476
"Just as a wanderer finds shelter."

406
00:27:19,304 --> 00:27:22,285
Uniting two lovers.

407
00:27:22,407 --> 00:27:23,579
Aren't there any wishes for her?

408
00:27:24,042 --> 00:27:26,147
There are. Of course.

409
00:27:26,211 --> 00:27:27,986
But all her wishes are really weird.

410
00:27:28,446 --> 00:27:31,393
Seeing a peacock dancing
in the first rain.

411
00:27:31,449 --> 00:27:33,588
To fly like a wind.

412
00:27:33,652 --> 00:27:35,097
Flying like the wind.

413
00:27:36,221 --> 00:27:39,964
Catching a butterfly
and playing with it.

414
00:27:40,025 --> 00:27:42,335
Touching the snow.

415
00:27:42,394 --> 00:27:46,206
Being famous for a day so
that people know who this girl is.

416
00:27:46,264 --> 00:27:49,711
Seeing the world under the sea.

417
00:27:49,768 --> 00:27:51,975
It gets serious now.

418
00:27:52,303 --> 00:27:56,445
And that is, to save someone's life.

419
00:27:57,242 --> 00:27:58,619
Saving someone's life.

420
00:27:59,144 --> 00:28:01,283
Guru, saving someone's life.

421
00:28:19,631 --> 00:28:21,269
Uncle, carefully.

422
00:28:22,233 --> 00:28:25,271
We're going to the graveyard.

423
00:28:42,721 --> 00:28:46,533
She directly went to
the hospital from church.

424
00:29:08,246 --> 00:29:09,384
Thank you, Guru.

425
00:29:10,048 --> 00:29:12,050
For the coins that I gave you...

426
00:29:12,117 --> 00:29:14,961
...you did much more for
Sheela and Chhotu than that.

427
00:29:15,453 --> 00:29:17,296
No matter how you look...

428
00:29:17,355 --> 00:29:20,427
...you're not such a bad villain
as you try to show the world.

429
00:29:20,959 --> 00:29:22,199
You have some good qualities.

430
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:23,568
Much more than the bad qualities.

431
00:29:23,628 --> 00:29:25,938
I'm not good! I'm very bad!

432
00:29:26,531 --> 00:29:27,566
What do you think of yourself?

433
00:29:27,999 --> 00:29:30,673
Do you think we live lo fulfill
your wishes in your diary? - No.

434
00:29:30,735 --> 00:29:31,611
You click everyone's pictures...

435
00:29:31,669 --> 00:29:33,080
...to show that you're
a very nice person?

436
00:29:33,138 --> 00:29:33,616
No.

437
00:29:33,671 --> 00:29:35,651
What do you try to prove
by cracking jokes every time?

438
00:29:36,741 --> 00:29:38,652
Look at that. Look at death.

439
00:29:39,544 --> 00:29:40,579
Do you want to make fun of it?

440
00:29:41,579 --> 00:29:43,217
Crack a joke on it! Come on!

441
00:29:48,553 --> 00:29:51,124
Life is playing the
biggest prank on me.

442
00:29:52,757 --> 00:29:55,533
The biggest joke is that
death is laughing at me.

443
00:29:57,128 --> 00:29:58,038
Yes, Guru.

444
00:30:00,031 --> 00:30:01,203
I'm going to die.

445
00:30:03,201 --> 00:30:08,241
These wishes that I want
to fulfill are my last wishes.

446
00:30:09,274 --> 00:30:13,586
I don't even know if I'll be able
to fulfill all of them before dying.

447
00:30:15,213 --> 00:30:16,055
I just...

448
00:30:18,216 --> 00:30:22,130
...want to live my life
like such a party that...

449
00:30:23,054 --> 00:30:24,328
...when death arrives...

450
00:30:24,689 --> 00:30:29,297
...l want to sit and have a couple
of drinks with it before leaving.

451
00:30:45,143 --> 00:30:46,281
It was very unfortunate, wasn't it?

452
00:30:49,214 --> 00:30:51,057
But if you befriend the devil...

453
00:30:51,549 --> 00:30:54,257
...it's bound to knock
on your door someday.

454
00:30:56,087 --> 00:30:57,998
Your Caesar killed your Aisha.

455
00:30:59,057 --> 00:31:00,127
But what will you do now?

456
00:31:00,458 --> 00:31:01,698
How will you kill Caesar?

457
00:31:02,393 --> 00:31:04,339
No. Let it be.
You won't be able to do it.

458
00:31:05,029 --> 00:31:07,168
The one who taught you to shoot...

459
00:31:07,732 --> 00:31:08,608
You will never kill him.

460
00:31:09,367 --> 00:31:11,711
Let me do a favour on you.

461
00:31:12,537 --> 00:31:13,982
I'll kill him.

462
00:31:14,439 --> 00:31:15,645
I'll take your revenge.

463
00:31:16,207 --> 00:31:17,311
I'll find him.

464
00:31:19,377 --> 00:31:20,515
No matter where he is.

465
00:31:48,506 --> 00:31:49,280
Where were you?

466
00:31:50,208 --> 00:31:51,414
I called you so many times.

467
00:31:51,743 --> 00:31:52,744
I even left a message.

468
00:31:53,211 --> 00:31:54,588
Who were you having fun with?

469
00:31:55,413 --> 00:31:56,289
Tell me.

470
00:32:03,187 --> 00:32:04,359
It was dead.

471
00:32:05,356 --> 00:32:06,528
My phone's battery.

472
00:32:06,591 --> 00:32:08,571
Your phone's battery was dead.

473
00:32:08,626 --> 00:32:10,105
But you were alive, weren't you?

474
00:32:10,161 --> 00:32:11,435
You could have called
from a public phone...

475
00:32:11,496 --> 00:32:12,497
...and informed that you'd be late.

476
00:32:13,698 --> 00:32:16,008
But no. You will never change.

477
00:32:16,367 --> 00:32:17,971
It's no use telling you anything.
- Listen.

478
00:32:18,036 --> 00:32:20,607
Look,
I've brought a chain for you.

479
00:32:21,439 --> 00:32:22,577
It'll look pretty on you.

480
00:32:31,416 --> 00:32:34,158
Look at this. You brought
bangles for me last week.

481
00:32:35,019 --> 00:32:36,623
They've turned black
in just one week.

482
00:32:38,456 --> 00:32:40,561
I had gone to aunt Madhvi's
house for a wedding.

483
00:32:42,093 --> 00:32:44,437
I was flaunting these to everyone
saying that these are gold bangles.

484
00:32:45,163 --> 00:32:47,234
But then I realised that
it's not gold, but brass.

485
00:32:47,732 --> 00:32:49,678
It's brass coated with fake gold!

486
00:32:50,401 --> 00:32:51,345
Here are your bangles.

487
00:32:53,171 --> 00:32:54,241
You wear these bangles!

488
00:32:54,806 --> 00:32:56,979
You and those bangles,
both are a fake!

489
00:32:58,042 --> 00:33:00,044
I just don't want to talk to you.

490
00:33:00,378 --> 00:33:01,948
You will not stay
in this house today.

491
00:33:02,013 --> 00:33:03,117
Get out of my house!

492
00:33:03,181 --> 00:33:04,159
Just get out!

493
00:33:04,215 --> 00:33:06,024
Listen to <i>me...</i>
- I said get out!

494
00:33:06,084 --> 00:33:07,358
Sulu!

495
00:33:07,418 --> 00:33:11,264
I really don't know how he was born.

496
00:33:13,024 --> 00:33:17,495
Get out of my house.
- Sulu, listen to me.

497
00:33:18,329 --> 00:33:19,535
Take this. come on.

498
00:33:19,597 --> 00:33:20,974
Listen to <i>me...</i> - Get out!

499
00:33:21,032 --> 00:33:21,476
<i>Sum.</i>

500
00:33:21,532 --> 00:33:22,510
Get out of here!

501
00:33:22,767 --> 00:33:23,939
Listen to me.

502
00:33:34,412 --> 00:33:35,220
Father.

503
00:33:45,456 --> 00:33:46,298
Take this.

504
00:33:49,293 --> 00:33:51,102
Don't feel bad about
what your mother said.

505
00:33:55,133 --> 00:33:57,010
She loves your father a lot.

506
00:33:57,402 --> 00:34:02,613
To be honest, men like you are giving
the men of India a tough time.

507
00:34:02,673 --> 00:34:05,085
If there are any more men like you...

508
00:34:05,576 --> 00:34:08,455
...then men will lose our manhood.

509
00:34:11,382 --> 00:34:12,656
Take this.

510
00:34:15,753 --> 00:34:18,165
Darling. Come here.

511
00:34:19,724 --> 00:34:20,998
Where's the ice!

512
00:34:21,993 --> 00:34:22,994
I forgot to get it.

513
00:34:23,061 --> 00:34:24,233
Get it now!

514
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:32,643
Look, Rakesh,
we are middleclass people.

515
00:34:33,771 --> 00:34:37,378
We're sandwiched between
the upper-class and the lower-class.

516
00:34:38,042 --> 00:34:39,180
The police torture us.

517
00:34:39,777 --> 00:34:41,415
The ministers torture us.

518
00:34:41,479 --> 00:34:43,117
The people torture us too.

519
00:34:43,181 --> 00:34:46,128
Our lives are too stressed.

520
00:34:46,384 --> 00:34:48,091
How do we get rid of it?

521
00:34:48,786 --> 00:34:52,461
That's why men like us
come home and beat our wives.

522
00:34:53,257 --> 00:34:56,500
There's no other way to vent
out our frustration, my brother.

523
00:34:57,695 --> 00:35:00,369
I have another solution
to your problem.

524
00:35:00,631 --> 00:35:02,201
Come to Mira Road with me.

525
00:35:02,266 --> 00:35:05,577
There are beautiful dancers
in the dance bars over there.

526
00:35:06,370 --> 00:35:07,644
Be an animal!

527
00:35:07,972 --> 00:35:10,418
Bring out the beast in you!

528
00:35:10,741 --> 00:35:11,947
Hunt!

529
00:35:32,563 --> 00:35:33,598
"II"

this message across that...'

00:35:36,634 --> 00:35:37,977
'...I'm proud of you.'

"Why am I lonely?"

"Why am I living in pieces?"

541

"Why is my soul enduring this?"

542
00:36:29,387 --> 00:36:34,393
"I'm incomplete."

548
00:37:20,304 --> 00:37:21,578

"You made me aware of light."

"I've returned to
this darkness now."

"But it seems unknown to me."

"Loneliness has left me."

refused to accept me."

"I'm incomplete."

562
00:40:21,719 --> 00:40:23,289
Put the pistol down!

563
00:40:26,791 --> 00:40:30,603
Guru, today I learnt that
the value of dogs is known...

564
00:40:30,661 --> 00:40:33,039
...only after a lion arrives.

565
00:40:33,297 --> 00:40:34,469
Why did you kill her?

566
00:40:34,799 --> 00:40:37,541
What? What did you say, Guru?

567
00:40:38,169 --> 00:40:40,080
How could you even think...

568
00:40:41,238 --> 00:40:44,708
...that the one who raised you
like a father and gave you life...

569
00:40:45,276 --> 00:40:48,257
...would take away your
reason to live from you?

570
00:40:49,313 --> 00:40:54,353
But if you still feel
that I've killed your Aisha...

571
00:40:55,186 --> 00:40:56,460
...then take this gun.

572
00:40:56,520 --> 00:40:57,260
Take it!

573
00:40:58,055 --> 00:40:59,193
And shoot me!

574
00:40:59,523 --> 00:41:03,562
Fire all the bullets in it at me!

575
00:41:03,627 --> 00:41:04,970
Why did you kill her?

576
00:41:05,029 --> 00:41:05,939
Shoot me!

577
00:41:06,430 --> 00:41:07,602
Shoot rne now!

578
00:41:07,665 --> 00:41:08,643
Shoot me!

579
00:41:09,166 --> 00:41:11,305
Don't fear. Shoot me!

580
00:41:23,080 --> 00:41:24,081
Guru.

581
00:41:25,549 --> 00:41:29,019
Don't let this fire
in you douse, Guru!

582
00:41:29,720 --> 00:41:32,667
Burn the world with this lava!

583
00:41:33,457 --> 00:41:35,334
Then come back here!

584
00:41:36,293 --> 00:41:38,000
To me!

585
00:41:38,329 --> 00:41:43,244
Because a lion deserves
to be in the forest!

586
00:41:43,567 --> 00:41:46,104
You are a lion! My lion!

587
00:41:46,170 --> 00:41:48,343
You are an idiot!

588
00:41:48,405 --> 00:41:50,385
You're completely useless.

589
00:41:50,441 --> 00:41:53,479
Oh, God! Rakesh Mahadkar,
what do I do with you?

590
00:41:53,544 --> 00:41:55,114
What is all this nonsense!

591
00:42:05,155 --> 00:42:06,225
Madam.
- Brijesh!

592
00:42:06,724 --> 00:42:09,637
I've made a lot of
money in the illegal deal.

593
00:42:09,693 --> 00:42:12,401
I've brought your share honestly.

594
00:42:12,663 --> 00:42:14,267
You're very naughty.

595
00:42:14,632 --> 00:42:16,669
Why don't you explain
to your friend?

596
00:42:17,101 --> 00:42:20,207
You're so active,
while he's the laziest.

597
00:42:20,271 --> 00:42:21,614
He comes and asks
me what his chances are...

598
00:42:21,672 --> 00:42:24,243
...for being the
employee of the month.

599
00:42:24,308 --> 00:42:27,448
The Xerox machine in this
office works more than you.

600
00:42:27,511 --> 00:42:28,649
The Xerox machine!

601
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:31,191
Really, you are not worthy
of earning even 2 rupees.

602
00:42:31,248 --> 00:42:33,455
You don't have that talent.

603
00:42:33,517 --> 00:42:36,589
Madam, he is a 2 rupee man.

604
00:42:36,654 --> 00:42:38,190
It's true.

605
00:42:38,255 --> 00:42:41,327
The Xerox machine in this office works
more than you. The Xerox machine!

606
00:42:41,392 --> 00:42:45,340
Really, you are not worthy
of earning even 2 rupees.

607
00:42:45,396 --> 00:42:46,636
Where are you lost?

608
00:42:47,031 --> 00:42:49,739
Have you come here to repair
the phone or waste your time?

609
00:42:50,067 --> 00:42:51,137
Lazy man!

610
00:42:51,468 --> 00:42:53,744
That's why people don't have telephones
in their homes these days.

611
00:42:54,071 --> 00:42:55,550
Your service is so bad.

612
00:42:56,040 --> 00:42:57,417
When we call you, you don't come.

613
00:42:57,474 --> 00:42:59,181
And when you come, you don't
even provide proper service.

614
00:43:00,244 --> 00:43:01,416
Look, I'm warning
you for the last time.

615
00:43:01,478 --> 00:43:05,119
If my phone doesn't work, then
I'll just get the connection cut.

616
00:43:05,182 --> 00:43:07,958
Then I won't have to
tolerate lazy people like you.

617
00:43:08,018 --> 00:43:08,519
And...

618
00:43:10,354 --> 00:43:12,391
What are you doing?
Where are you going?

619
00:43:12,456 --> 00:43:14,299
Have you come to
repair the phone or...

620
00:43:16,093 --> 00:43:16,662
Madam.

621
00:43:17,761 --> 00:43:19,297
Don't worry.

622
00:43:20,531 --> 00:43:22,943
You'll have no complaints
against us henceforth.

623
00:43:25,603 --> 00:43:27,412
'You shouldn't have yelled at me.'

624
00:43:28,706 --> 00:43:30,276
Everyone makes fun of me.

625
00:43:31,542 --> 00:43:32,646
They call me lazy.

626
00:43:34,044 --> 00:43:34,988
They call me a beggar.

627
00:43:35,713 --> 00:43:37,192
They abuse me.

628
00:43:38,549 --> 00:43:40,961
'My friend Brijesh is right.'

629
00:43:41,452 --> 00:43:43,261
'We're middleclass people...'

630
00:43:43,787 --> 00:43:46,393
'...who are sandwiched between
the upper and the lower.'

631
00:43:47,391 --> 00:43:48,699
'The world tortures us.'

632
00:43:49,360 --> 00:43:51,067
'The system tortures us.'

633
00:43:51,762 --> 00:43:53,298
And when we go home,
our wives torture us too.

634
00:43:53,364 --> 00:43:54,672
Today I don't want you in the house.

635
00:43:54,732 --> 00:43:55,972
Get out.

636
00:43:56,266 --> 00:43:57,609
I said out.

637
00:43:58,135 --> 00:44:02,083
Sometimes I feel like killing her.

638
00:44:06,010 --> 00:44:07,921
But I can never
raise my hand at her.

639
00:44:10,414 --> 00:44:12,291
I love my wife a lot.

640
00:44:13,250 --> 00:44:14,251
<i>'My Sulo.'</i>

641
00:44:15,419 --> 00:44:16,454
'Sulochana.'

642
00:44:17,454 --> 00:44:19,024
'Sulo is her pet name.'

643
00:44:19,757 --> 00:44:21,134
'She means the world to rne.'

644
00:44:22,059 --> 00:44:23,094
'She means everything to rne.'

645
00:44:23,727 --> 00:44:26,207
Creep! Who the hell
do you think you are!

646
00:44:26,263 --> 00:44:27,298
Oh, I know who you are!

647
00:44:27,364 --> 00:44:28,206
A bloody little pig!
- 'You know...

648
00:44:28,532 --> 00:44:29,670
Frustrated pervert!
- You know what?

649
00:44:29,733 --> 00:44:32,714
I've never even looked
at another woman but her.'

650
00:44:34,071 --> 00:44:35,049
'Why should I?'

651
00:44:36,040 --> 00:44:38,987
'My Sulo is so beautiful.'
- Look at his face!

652
00:44:40,411 --> 00:44:41,651
'She could have found anyone.'

653
00:44:42,446 --> 00:44:44,289
'But she chose me.'

654
00:44:48,385 --> 00:44:50,058
What? Who are you?

655
00:44:50,320 --> 00:44:51,321
Telephone maintenance.

656
00:44:52,156 --> 00:44:53,328
I need to check your phone.

657
00:44:54,024 --> 00:44:55,059
It'll be done in no time.

658
00:44:55,392 --> 00:44:56,462
Fine. Over there.

659
00:45:01,532 --> 00:45:03,307
She has all the right to yell at me.

660
00:45:06,336 --> 00:45:09,476
Yes, I do feel very angry.

661
00:45:14,344 --> 00:45:19,953
And instead of her,
when I kill other women like you...

662
00:45:23,253 --> 00:45:25,290
...l feel much better.

663
00:45:27,157 --> 00:45:29,262
'As all of you die...'

664
00:45:30,060 --> 00:45:33,473
<i>'...I</i> get rid of all
my worries and stress.'

665
00:45:35,232 --> 00:45:37,337
'Your pain doesn't make me happy.'

666
00:45:38,135 --> 00:45:39,273
'It satisfies me.'

667
00:45:40,204 --> 00:45:41,274
By killing you,“

668
00:45:44,608 --> 00:45:46,554
...l keep my love alive.

669
00:45:47,177 --> 00:45:52,422
And Hake a gift for
my Sulo from every corpse.

670
00:45:55,085 --> 00:45:58,157
'Usually,
a person is born ordinary.'

671
00:45:59,022 --> 00:46:00,057
'He lives an ordinary life.'

672
00:46:00,457 --> 00:46:01,527
'He dies ordinarily.'

673
00:46:03,227 --> 00:46:05,070
'If not on the big
screen or in the world...'

674
00:46:05,662 --> 00:46:10,338
'...he should be a hero
at least in his house.'

675
00:46:11,068 --> 00:46:12,103
'I want you to wear it.'

676
00:46:13,036 --> 00:46:14,071
'VVho?'

677
00:46:15,172 --> 00:46:16,116
'Her.'

678
00:46:18,308 --> 00:46:19,218
'You.

679
00:46:20,244 --> 00:46:22,417
'Whose necklace have
you stolen for me?'

680
00:46:25,315 --> 00:46:26,453
'What did you say?'

681
00:46:27,050 --> 00:46:28,654
'You think I'm a thief?'

682
00:46:32,456 --> 00:46:34,060
Rakesh, what are you doing?
Leave it.

683
00:46:36,393 --> 00:46:40,239
'My Sulo gets happy
when she gets a gift.'

684
00:46:42,065 --> 00:46:43,339
'It makes rne happy, too.'

685
00:46:43,700 --> 00:46:44,269
Eat.

686
00:46:45,302 --> 00:46:48,340
'My family becomes a happy family.'

687
00:46:49,239 --> 00:46:50,047
Are you dieting?

688
00:46:50,107 --> 00:46:52,053
I do this for my family.

689
00:46:52,609 --> 00:46:54,111
'For their happiness.'

690
00:46:55,345 --> 00:46:57,120
'I have just one dream in life.'

691
00:46:58,248 --> 00:47:01,092
'That my Sulo
considers rne her hero.'

692
00:47:02,486 --> 00:47:03,658
‘That she tells
me that she loves me.‘

693
00:47:05,222 --> 00:47:06,667
'So that even I can say to her...'

694
00:47:08,592 --> 00:47:11,630
Madam, don't worry.

695
00:47:13,997 --> 00:47:16,603
You won't have any complaints
against me henceforth.

696
00:47:28,412 --> 00:47:31,120
A criminal always goes
back to the crime scene.

697
00:47:31,682 --> 00:47:34,925
And a lover always comes back
to the place where he fell in love.

698
00:47:35,586 --> 00:47:38,692
I sent you to Goa with high hopes,
to kill Caesar.

699
00:47:43,126 --> 00:47:44,469
Can I tell you a secret?

700
00:47:45,095 --> 00:47:46,938
He didn't kill your wife.

701
00:47:47,397 --> 00:47:48,307
It was someone else.

702
00:47:50,534 --> 00:47:54,641
A beast like you who's killing
women using different weapons.

703
00:47:55,606 --> 00:47:58,280
But do you know what
his most special weapon is?

704
00:47:59,643 --> 00:48:00,951
A screwdriver.

705
00:48:02,145 --> 00:48:02,953
Look at this.

706
00:48:04,948 --> 00:48:05,551
He has committed these murders“

707
00:48:06,016 --> 00:48:07,893
..in such brutal ways.

708
00:48:08,285 --> 00:48:12,131
It's difficult to make
out who's someone's mother...

709
00:48:13,223 --> 00:48:15,032
...and who's someone's wife.

710
00:48:18,962 --> 00:48:20,168
You're angry, aren't you?

711
00:48:21,031 --> 00:48:22,271
You're furious.

712
00:48:23,667 --> 00:48:26,944
But just as you didn't
let me take my revenge...

713
00:48:27,971 --> 00:48:30,918
...l won't let you
take your revenge either.

714
00:48:34,011 --> 00:48:35,649
Let's see who wins now.

715
00:48:36,413 --> 00:48:38,984
Your love or my hatred.

716
00:48:52,763 --> 00:48:54,606
Thank you! Thank you!

717
00:48:54,665 --> 00:48:56,941
Bye, dear! Bye!

718
00:49:01,505 --> 00:49:04,179
I want to help you fulfill
the remaining wishes in your diary.

719
00:49:12,716 --> 00:49:14,195
Do you want to hear a joke?

720
00:49:15,652 --> 00:49:16,392
Yes.

721
00:49:16,453 --> 00:49:18,990
Forget it. I don't want to say it.

722
00:49:20,090 --> 00:49:22,161
Because you'll listen to the joke
as if you're sympathizing with me.

723
00:49:23,393 --> 00:49:24,133
Thank you.

724
00:49:24,428 --> 00:49:26,339
But I don't need it.

725
00:49:27,431 --> 00:49:32,141
I've breathed in this
city as much as I could.

726
00:49:33,103 --> 00:49:38,143
Now it's time to fly to another place
and breathe for as long as I can.

727
00:49:40,277 --> 00:49:41,915
My father was addicted to gambling.

728
00:49:43,680 --> 00:49:47,025
He used to bet in cards,
cricket, everything.

729
00:49:48,485 --> 00:49:51,364
And one day, he lost so
much that he bet on his life.

730
00:49:52,689 --> 00:49:56,569
'I was 8 years old when my
parents were killed in front of rne.'

731
00:50:01,231 --> 00:50:03,268
'I was hiding under the bed.'

732
00:50:06,003 --> 00:50:07,983
'I didn't do anything to save them.'

733
00:50:08,772 --> 00:50:11,719
'After that, people tried
to give rne shelter in their homes.'

734
00:50:12,109 --> 00:50:15,181
'But I didn't want shelter.
I wanted revenge.'

735
00:50:16,747 --> 00:50:18,351
'One day, I took my revenge.'

736
00:50:20,450 --> 00:50:22,726
'I killed those people
who orphaned me.'

737
00:50:27,024 --> 00:50:28,697
'I thought I'd be
peaceful after that.'

738
00:50:30,160 --> 00:50:31,298
'That I'd be able to sleep.'

739
00:50:35,065 --> 00:50:36,271
'But I was wrong.'

740
00:50:39,102 --> 00:50:42,140
The other day,
when I helped Chotu with you...

741
00:50:43,407 --> 00:50:44,977
...was the first time
that I slept peacefully.

742
00:50:45,709 --> 00:50:46,710
I was relaxed.

743
00:50:50,113 --> 00:50:51,091
Why did that happen?

744
00:50:57,554 --> 00:51:00,433
Because for the first time,
you did something for someone else.

745
00:51:02,125 --> 00:51:03,468
Darkness cannot drive out darkness.

746
00:51:04,561 --> 00:51:06,563
Only light can do that.

747
00:51:07,998 --> 00:51:09,272
Hate cannot drive out hate.

748
00:51:09,599 --> 00:51:11,306
Only love can do that.

749
00:51:12,402 --> 00:51:15,383
That 8-year-old child who
was under the bed out of fear...

750
00:51:16,473 --> 00:51:17,975
...is still over there.

751
00:51:19,009 --> 00:51:21,250
He only needs someone's hand.

752
00:51:23,246 --> 00:51:24,623
Someone's support.

753
00:51:25,415 --> 00:51:28,521
Someone who can pull him out of
the darkness and bring him to light.

754
00:51:32,222 --> 00:51:34,498
Unless we share
someone else's pain...

755
00:51:37,027 --> 00:51:41,407
...we can never relieve
ourselves of pain.

756
00:52:04,354 --> 00:52:09,167
"This is where nightfall happens."

757
00:52:09,493 --> 00:52:14,374
"This is where it's dawn."

758
00:52:14,631 --> 00:52:19,307
"This is where I
have to live and die."

759
00:52:19,703 --> 00:52:25,619
"This is where I find spirituality."

760
00:52:37,721 --> 00:52:42,727
"This is where nightfall happens."

761
00:52:42,792 --> 00:52:47,605
"This is where it's dawn."

762
00:52:48,031 --> 00:52:52,707
"This is where I
have to live and die."

763
00:52:53,170 --> 00:52:58,552
"This is where I find spirituality."

764
00:52:59,309 --> 00:53:02,051
"Your home."

765
00:53:02,112 --> 00:53:04,285
"Your home."

766
00:53:04,347 --> 00:53:09,228
"l find solace in your abode."

767
00:53:09,553 --> 00:53:12,227
"Your home."

768
00:53:12,289 --> 00:53:14,360
"Your home."

769
00:53:14,424 --> 00:53:19,464
"l yearn for your abode."

770
00:53:41,051 --> 00:53:45,397
"You sleep in my slumber."

771
00:53:46,122 --> 00:53:50,468
"You cry over my tears."

772
00:53:51,161 --> 00:53:55,974
"Someone whispers in my thoughts."

773
00:53:56,366 --> 00:54:00,644
"l feel your presence
even when you're not around."

774
00:54:00,971 --> 00:54:05,420
"You are the cure..."

775
00:54:06,109 --> 00:54:15,518
"...to my pain."

776
00:54:16,353 --> 00:54:21,302
"You're in my prayers."

777
00:54:21,358 --> 00:54:23,964
"Your home."

778
00:54:24,027 --> 00:54:26,268
"Your home."

779
00:54:26,329 --> 00:54:31,278
"l find solace in your abode."

780
00:54:31,334 --> 00:54:34,281
"Your home."

781
00:54:34,337 --> 00:54:36,339
"Your home."

782
00:54:36,406 --> 00:54:41,685
"l yearn for your abode."

783
00:55:02,732 --> 00:55:07,238
"What kind of a
relationship do we share?"

784
00:55:08,038 --> 00:55:12,680
"It has no name,
but it's still so deep."

785
00:55:13,043 --> 00:55:17,617
"These moments are priceless."

786
00:55:18,248 --> 00:55:22,663
"We might lose them."

787
00:55:22,719 --> 00:55:31,264
"Let this moment..."

788
00:55:31,328 --> 00:55:38,371
"...come to a halt."

789
00:55:38,435 --> 00:55:42,577
"Don't go away from me."

790
00:55:43,306 --> 00:55:45,684
"Your home."

791
00:55:46,009 --> 00:55:48,250
"Your home."

792
00:55:48,311 --> 00:55:53,556
"l yearn for your abode."

793
00:56:31,121 --> 00:56:32,031
Aisha!

794
00:56:38,294 --> 00:56:39,170
Aisha.

795
00:56:42,198 --> 00:56:44,371
I slipped. I'm fine.

796
00:56:44,734 --> 00:56:46,577
Aisha, you're not well.
Let's go back.

797
00:56:47,737 --> 00:56:48,715
Are you crazy?

798
00:56:50,006 --> 00:56:51,952
Peacocks dance only
on the first rain.

799
00:56:52,442 --> 00:56:54,979
Since we've come this far,
let's wait for some time.

800
00:56:55,044 --> 00:56:56,045
You can see it some other time.

801
00:56:56,112 --> 00:56:56,988
Let's go back now. Come on.

802
00:56:57,313 --> 00:57:00,157
I don't have much time.

803
00:57:21,171 --> 00:57:25,017
The peacock danced already.
Come next year, sir!

804
00:57:25,074 --> 00:57:26,280
It's going to rain heavily.

805
00:57:34,617 --> 00:57:35,595
You're back?

806
00:57:36,619 --> 00:57:38,565
It's impossible for her to survive.

807
00:57:39,088 --> 00:57:41,261
Please don't waste my time.

808
00:57:41,691 --> 00:57:42,669
I just can't help her.

809
00:57:48,131 --> 00:57:50,111
Hey! Who do you think you are!

810
00:57:50,166 --> 00:57:51,702
Are you God!
- What are you doing!

811
00:57:51,768 --> 00:57:53,679
Back off! Are you God
to say that she can't survive!

812
00:57:54,070 --> 00:57:56,676
Save her or I'll kill you today!
Save her!

813
00:57:56,739 --> 00:57:59,618
If I could save her, then wouldn't
I have saved my wife first...

814
00:57:59,676 --> 00:58:02,418
...who is dying each day with cancer!

815
00:58:04,080 --> 00:58:09,189
In spite of being a doctor,
I am as helpless as you are.

816
00:58:18,161 --> 00:58:20,198
If you have to try one last time...

817
00:58:22,699 --> 00:58:24,542
...then take Aisha to Mumbai.

818
00:58:26,202 --> 00:58:27,476
There's a doctor over there.

819
00:58:28,738 --> 00:58:30,115
Prema Shrivastav.

820
00:58:31,007 --> 00:58:32,315
'She couldn't help me.'

821
00:58:33,576 --> 00:58:35,487
'But maybe she can help you.'

822
00:59:22,992 --> 00:59:26,439
Guru, you fulfilled
so many wishes of mine.

823
00:59:26,963 --> 00:59:28,067
Can you fulfil another one?

824
00:59:28,998 --> 00:59:32,605
If I die before
fulfilling all these...

825
00:59:33,736 --> 00:59:36,342
...then you fulfil the rest
of the wishes for me. Okay?

826
00:59:37,273 --> 00:59:39,048
But don't worry.

827
00:59:39,742 --> 00:59:44,213
Even after I die, don't
think that I'll leave you alone.

828
00:59:44,981 --> 00:59:46,551
I'll always be with you.

829
00:59:48,551 --> 00:59:49,689
Like the breeze.

830
00:59:53,156 --> 00:59:58,936
Just close your eyes
and feel the breeze.

831
01:00:01,297 --> 01:00:03,140
Whenever it touches your face...

832
01:00:04,334 --> 01:00:06,041
...it would mean that it's me.

833
01:00:25,054 --> 01:00:26,590
God, thank You.

834
01:00:27,490 --> 01:00:29,401
Everything is perfect in my house.

835
01:00:30,560 --> 01:00:33,166
Mother and father
don't quarrel anymore.

836
01:00:34,397 --> 01:00:36,274
Please keep everyone happy.

837
01:00:37,467 --> 01:00:40,573
And I promise to offer
my cars to you nine more times.

838
01:00:40,637 --> 01:00:41,672
Thank you.

839
01:00:45,408 --> 01:00:47,752
God, these are my favourite toys.

840
01:00:48,344 --> 01:00:50,415
Take them away.

841
01:00:50,480 --> 01:00:53,188
But please keep my family happy.

842
01:00:54,617 --> 01:00:55,595
Can I help?

843
01:01:06,329 --> 01:01:08,309
Did a girl give you this?

844
01:01:08,364 --> 01:01:10,708
No. My father gave it to me.

845
01:01:28,017 --> 01:01:29,655
What are you doing?
You're taking so long.

846
01:01:30,119 --> 01:01:32,099
If we get late,
then the theatre will be full.

847
01:01:32,522 --> 01:01:36,060
And anyway, you can't afford
to pay extra for the tickets.

848
01:01:36,793 --> 01:01:37,965
Hurry UP-

849
01:01:44,667 --> 01:01:46,010
We will get the tickets, Sulo.

850
01:01:48,271 --> 01:01:49,306
Don't worry.

851
01:01:50,273 --> 01:01:52,651
Why? ls it your father's theatre?

852
01:01:52,709 --> 01:01:54,347
Did you get it as a gift?

853
01:01:54,777 --> 01:01:56,085
Look, I'm warning you.

854
01:01:56,345 --> 01:01:59,724
If I miss the hero's entry, then
I won't watch the rest of the movie.

855
01:02:00,349 --> 01:02:03,626
Anyway, we get to see
a hero only on the big screen...

856
01:02:04,253 --> 01:02:05,459
...and not in real life.

857
01:02:06,355 --> 01:02:08,357
What are you doing, Rakesh?
Leave this.

858
01:02:08,424 --> 01:02:09,266
Give it to me.

859
01:02:29,112 --> 01:02:30,682
Give us some money.

860
01:02:31,013 --> 01:02:33,118
I'll pray you two
always stay together.

861
01:02:33,182 --> 01:02:34,024
Hold on.

862
01:02:34,083 --> 01:02:36,427
Give us happily.

863
01:02:36,486 --> 01:02:39,296
Give us some money.
- Give us some money.

864
01:02:39,355 --> 01:02:40,026
Take this.

865
01:02:40,456 --> 01:02:42,163
I don't have more than this.

866
01:02:42,458 --> 01:02:44,563
Okay.

867
01:02:45,261 --> 01:02:46,239
Why did you give them money?

868
01:02:47,330 --> 01:02:48,741
They were harassing us.

869
01:02:49,031 --> 01:02:52,012
If I hadn't given them money,
then they wouldn't have gone.

870
01:02:53,069 --> 01:02:54,673
What kind of a man is he?

871
01:02:55,271 --> 01:02:57,251
Anyone can take advantage of him.

872
01:03:01,010 --> 01:03:04,355
Driver, stop. Please stop.

873
01:03:04,981 --> 01:03:06,426
Why are you getting down?

874
01:03:07,016 --> 01:03:09,189
I don't have money
to go any further.

875
01:03:09,585 --> 01:03:12,293
What?
- I spent all the money, Sulo.

876
01:03:13,689 --> 01:03:15,327
Driver, take this.

877
01:03:17,126 --> 01:03:19,265
Come. Let's go.
- Leave him.

878
01:03:21,430 --> 01:03:22,340
Go.

879
01:03:22,398 --> 01:03:23,706
<i>But Sum...</i>

880
01:03:24,066 --> 01:03:27,172
But what?
You think I don't have any money?

881
01:03:27,703 --> 01:03:30,206
I've saved some money.
It's my money.

882
01:03:31,474 --> 01:03:37,117
If I depend on you, then I'll
have to beg on the street someday.

883
01:03:37,180 --> 01:03:40,992
Let's go, driver.
- But Sulo... how will I go home?

884
01:03:41,350 --> 01:03:44,160
Just as you go everyday!
In the crowded train!

885
01:03:46,122 --> 01:03:48,602
'I married you with many dreams.'

886
01:03:49,158 --> 01:03:52,298
'But all my dreams have shattered.'

887
01:03:52,361 --> 01:03:54,102
'Every small business man
has a car now.'

888
01:03:54,163 --> 01:03:56,109
'But you'll always remain a beggar.'

889
01:03:56,165 --> 01:03:58,736
'I'm ill fated. It's not your mistake.'

890
01:03:59,035 --> 01:04:01,242
'You're an idiot.'

891
01:04:01,304 --> 01:04:04,080
You're useless, man.

892
01:04:04,407 --> 01:04:06,353
You're completely useless.

893
01:04:07,043 --> 01:04:10,388
Then what happened? You know
what had happened on Christmas?

894
01:04:23,893 --> 01:04:26,601
It's not your cup of tea.

895
01:04:27,029 --> 01:04:29,475
You're running behind her.

896
01:04:29,532 --> 01:04:31,136
But you'll not get her.

897
01:04:31,200 --> 01:04:32,372
She won't listen to you.

898
01:04:32,435 --> 01:04:34,540
But will you not listen to me?

899
01:04:34,604 --> 01:04:36,140
I had told you.

900
01:04:36,205 --> 01:04:39,118
Listen to me and do something.

901
01:04:49,385 --> 01:04:50,625
Did you stop laughing now?

902
01:04:52,255 --> 01:04:53,962
You were laughing at me,
weren't you?

903
01:04:55,024 --> 01:04:57,630
All of you like making
fun of me, right?

904
01:05:02,565 --> 01:05:06,172
The Xerox machine in
the office works more than me.

905
01:05:13,209 --> 01:05:15,052
Call your Xerox machine.

906
01:05:15,478 --> 01:05:17,253
To save your life.

907
01:05:20,082 --> 01:05:21,618
Don't worry, madam.

908
01:05:23,452 --> 01:05:27,559
Henceforth, you won't
have any complaints against me.

909
01:05:56,085 --> 01:05:57,496
She slipped and fell.

910
01:05:58,587 --> 01:06:01,898
When I came walking from there,
I saw her lying here.

911
01:06:30,386 --> 01:06:32,957
Hey“ Help.

912
01:06:36,292 --> 01:06:38,363
I won't let you die.

913
01:06:39,595 --> 01:06:41,575
But I will still kill you every day.

914
01:06:42,264 --> 01:06:46,041
Not once, but a thousand times.

915
01:06:46,535 --> 01:06:48,981
You will face death each time...

916
01:06:49,572 --> 01:06:52,075
...but it won't come to you.

917
01:06:52,608 --> 01:06:55,418
The more you try to embrace death...

918
01:06:56,145 --> 01:06:58,352
...the longer you'll live.

919
01:06:58,414 --> 01:07:02,294
I will keep an account of
every drop of blood that you shed.

920
01:07:03,486 --> 01:07:06,626
I will capture your last breath.

921
01:07:07,656 --> 01:07:09,897
I'll hit you so much...

922
01:07:10,726 --> 01:07:13,900
...that you will be in
pain as long as you're alive...

923
01:07:14,330 --> 01:07:17,368
...and your soul will
scream after you die.

924
01:07:32,515 --> 01:07:34,995
Hit me.

925
01:07:35,051 --> 01:07:37,031
Hit me. Why do you spare me?

926
01:07:37,420 --> 01:07:39,696
Hit me.

927
01:07:56,142 --> 01:07:59,248
Go in and get yourself treated.

928
01:07:59,312 --> 01:08:00,586
First you hit me...

929
01:08:01,214 --> 01:08:02,318
...then you save me...

930
01:08:03,316 --> 01:08:05,262
...and then you bring me
to a hospital and give me money.

931
01:08:06,453 --> 01:08:07,796
Who are you?

932
01:08:08,855 --> 01:08:11,563
lam the one who won't
let you die in peace...

933
01:08:12,125 --> 01:08:13,695
...nor will I let you live in peace.

934
01:08:15,728 --> 01:08:18,208
Get the medicine.
Get yourself cured.

935
01:08:19,199 --> 01:08:21,076
Because once your pain is soothed...

936
01:08:22,335 --> 01:08:24,110
...once your wounds are healed...

937
01:08:24,404 --> 01:08:27,647
...I'll be back to
inflict new wounds.

938
01:08:28,675 --> 01:08:30,677
This is your fate now.

939
01:08:31,277 --> 01:08:32,620
This is your punishment.

940
01:08:41,488 --> 01:08:44,162
Mother, who hit father?

941
01:08:44,557 --> 01:08:45,399
Keep quiet.

942
01:08:45,658 --> 01:08:46,329
Go out.

943
01:08:49,762 --> 01:08:52,675
Listen. Stay inside the hospital.

944
01:08:53,199 --> 01:08:55,475
Don't go out. Okay?

945
01:08:57,804 --> 01:08:59,306
Your boss was attacked yesterday.

946
01:09:00,106 --> 01:09:01,141
Today you were attacked.

947
01:09:01,407 --> 01:09:03,478
Either the whole office
has a lot of enemies...

948
01:09:03,543 --> 01:09:05,352
...or you're each other's enemies.

949
01:09:05,411 --> 01:09:07,482
Come on. Tell me from the beginning.

950
01:09:07,547 --> 01:09:09,549
Excuse me. What are you doing?

951
01:09:09,849 --> 01:09:11,795
You're not allowed to give
outside food to the patient.

952
01:09:12,318 --> 01:09:14,389
Do you want him to eat
the hospital food?

953
01:09:14,454 --> 01:09:16,127
Do you intend to make him sick?

954
01:09:16,489 --> 01:09:18,264
These are the rules of the hospital.

955
01:09:18,324 --> 01:09:21,100
You're not allowed to give
the patient anything besides fruits.

956
01:09:21,161 --> 01:09:22,231
Close your lunchbox.

957
01:09:22,295 --> 01:09:24,241
I'm closing it.
Can't you see? I won't give him.

958
01:09:24,297 --> 01:09:25,173
But they didn't listen.

959
01:09:25,498 --> 01:09:26,374
I'm warning you.

960
01:09:26,766 --> 01:09:29,542
This will not be tolerated here.
- Then they started hitting me.

961
01:09:29,602 --> 01:09:30,512
I can't believe this.

962
01:09:30,570 --> 01:09:33,779
You can't help it, sir.
Some people are very bad.

963
01:09:33,840 --> 01:09:35,376
Fine. I'll come back for
more information.

964
01:09:35,441 --> 01:09:36,749
- Show me those medicines.

965
01:09:38,244 --> 01:09:40,417
You've never even
killed a fly at home.

966
01:09:42,415 --> 01:09:46,022
What was the need to hit goons
on the street and try to be a hero?

967
01:09:46,519 --> 01:09:48,624
Look at your face.
Look what you've done to yourself.

968
01:09:49,289 --> 01:09:51,394
Moreover, you got yourself
admitted in such a reputed hospital.

969
01:09:51,791 --> 01:09:55,034
How will we pay the fees?

970
01:09:59,332 --> 01:10:00,242
Take this.

971
01:10:00,800 --> 01:10:01,744
For the fees.

972
01:10:11,678 --> 01:10:13,123
This...

973
01:10:22,088 --> 01:10:23,761
I don't like to yell at you.

974
01:10:27,093 --> 01:10:28,663
But if something
had happened to you...

975
01:10:31,531 --> 01:10:33,067
...then what would my Manu have done?

976
01:10:34,734 --> 01:10:35,769
I'm sorry, Sulo.

977
01:10:41,241 --> 01:10:42,447
I love you.

978
01:10:51,651 --> 01:10:52,459
What's this?

979
01:10:53,453 --> 01:10:56,161
I just told you that he's
not allowed to eat outside food.

980
01:10:56,222 --> 01:10:58,498
Don't you understand
when you're explained once?

981
01:10:58,558 --> 01:11:00,731
Security!
- Why are you calling the security?

982
01:11:01,160 --> 01:11:03,606
What's your job?
To clean everyone's mess.

983
01:11:04,397 --> 01:11:06,308
But you're behaving like a queen.

984
01:11:06,566 --> 01:11:09,046
Sulo. - I wonder
where they've come from.

985
01:11:09,102 --> 01:11:10,080
You leave.

986
01:11:12,238 --> 01:11:13,239
Take care.

987
01:11:15,074 --> 01:11:16,109
I'm sorry, madam.

988
01:11:16,476 --> 01:11:18,615
I shouldn't have any
complaints henceforth.

989
01:11:44,370 --> 01:11:46,008
I can't get there.

990
01:12:03,189 --> 01:12:05,226
God!

991
01:12:06,059 --> 01:12:09,666
I'm sorry. I couldn't come
to pray this week.

992
01:12:16,169 --> 01:12:16,738
Guru?

993
01:12:18,237 --> 01:12:19,648
Are you okay?

994
01:12:21,407 --> 01:12:23,011
Listen, I'm really sorry.

995
01:12:23,843 --> 01:12:26,221
I can't believe that
this happened to Aisha.

996
01:12:26,679 --> 01:12:29,182
God plays such
strange games with us.

997
01:12:30,216 --> 01:12:33,629
She was going to bring
a new life into this world, but...

998
01:12:35,088 --> 01:12:36,032
Yes.

999
01:12:36,489 --> 01:12:37,763
She was pregnant.

1000
01:12:38,758 --> 01:12:40,237
Didn't she tell you?

1001
01:12:42,595 --> 01:12:45,007
Anyway, I'm really sorry.

1002
01:12:45,431 --> 01:12:47,468
Please take care of yourself.

1003
01:13:13,059 --> 01:13:14,402
Again this tube light
started flickering.

1004
01:13:16,062 --> 01:13:17,507
There's no maintenance here.

1005
01:14:06,045 --> 01:14:08,025
The more you struggle...

1006
01:14:09,081 --> 01:14:10,560
...the more it'll hurt.

1007
01:14:12,084 --> 01:14:14,724
If you slay calm,
I'll kill you lovingly.

1008
01:14:53,326 --> 01:14:55,670
You killed my baby.

1009
01:14:55,728 --> 01:14:57,571
You killed my baby!

1010
01:14:57,630 --> 01:14:59,405
She was pregnant.

1011
01:15:02,068 --> 01:15:04,048
She was pregnant!

1012
01:15:04,103 --> 01:15:05,275
You killed my baby.

1013
01:15:05,638 --> 01:15:07,379
She was pregnant!

1014
01:15:07,440 --> 01:15:09,351
She was pregnant!

1015
01:15:09,408 --> 01:15:11,012
She was pregnant!

1016
01:15:13,546 --> 01:15:15,048
She was pregnant!

1017
01:15:15,448 --> 01:15:17,519
She was pregnant!

1018
01:15:17,583 --> 01:15:19,187
You killed my baby!

1019
01:15:19,619 --> 01:15:23,157
He's dead! He's dead!

1020
01:15:36,335 --> 01:15:37,109
Get up!

1021
01:15:39,272 --> 01:15:42,549
Get up!

1022
01:15:44,644 --> 01:15:47,591
You can't die so easily.

1023
01:15:47,647 --> 01:15:48,625
Get up!

1024
01:15:49,048 --> 01:15:51,722
You can't die so easily! Get up!

1025
01:15:52,718 --> 01:15:58,293
Hey! You can't die so easily!
Get up!

1026
01:15:59,058 --> 01:16:00,469
Hey! Make him alive.

1027
01:16:00,526 --> 01:16:04,531
Please let rne go! I won't tell anyone!
- Hey! He must live for rne.

1028
01:16:05,097 --> 01:16:07,043
He can't die so easily!

1029
01:16:07,099 --> 01:16:08,271
Bring him back to life!

1030
01:16:15,441 --> 01:16:19,184
Get up!
- He needs..

1031
01:16:20,246 --> 01:16:25,218
This... has to go... in his heart...

1032
01:16:49,175 --> 01:16:51,280
He killed your baby.

1033
01:16:53,446 --> 01:16:55,483
Even then you saved his life?

1034
01:16:56,248 --> 01:16:57,192
Why?

1035
01:16:59,185 --> 01:17:00,994
Why didn't you let him die?

1036
01:17:01,654 --> 01:17:03,998
Spare my son, Guru.

1037
01:17:08,995 --> 01:17:11,032
The man who killed your son...

1038
01:17:11,330 --> 01:17:13,708
...is he present in the court?

1039
01:17:14,600 --> 01:17:17,308
Madam, is he present in the court?

1040
01:17:18,270 --> 01:17:19,271
Answer me.

1041
01:17:23,142 --> 01:17:24,018
No.

1042
01:17:27,380 --> 01:17:28,620
He's not here.

1043
01:17:29,382 --> 01:17:30,986
Hold the police also.

1044
01:17:31,684 --> 01:17:36,258
Deepu's death was an accident.

1045
01:17:36,322 --> 01:17:40,168
Due to lack of evidence, Deepu's
death is declared an accident...

1046
01:17:40,226 --> 01:17:42,206
...and this case is dismissed.

1047
01:17:42,261 --> 01:17:44,298
Accused is set free.

1048
01:17:53,305 --> 01:17:55,546
I haven't forgotten my son's death.

1049
01:17:57,076 --> 01:17:58,646
Nor am I scared of you.

1050
01:17:59,578 --> 01:18:03,720
You want to know why I didn't
testify against you, don't you?

1051
01:18:05,117 --> 01:18:12,092
Because you will be punished
not by a judge in court but by God.

1052
01:18:13,092 --> 01:18:15,197
How did you get away from
the bullets the other day?

1053
01:18:16,162 --> 01:18:20,167
Because He has a punishment
worse than death for you.

1054
01:18:21,534 --> 01:18:24,640
One day, your dear one
will die in front of you.

1055
01:18:26,338 --> 01:18:28,181
And you won't be able to save him.

1056
01:18:36,849 --> 01:18:38,624
Passenger, please pay attention.

1057
01:18:38,684 --> 01:18:41,358
Janshatabdi express from
Goa to Mumbai“

1058
01:18:41,420 --> 01:18:44,128
..will depart from platform number <i>6</i>
on it's scheduled time.

1059
01:18:44,190 --> 01:18:46,227
Aisha.

1060
01:18:46,292 --> 01:18:48,033
You're always running in life.

1061
01:18:49,161 --> 01:18:51,038
From one place to another.

1062
01:18:53,099 --> 01:18:54,510
Who are you running away from today?

1063
01:18:55,167 --> 01:18:56,612
I'm not running away from anyone.

1064
01:18:56,669 --> 01:19:00,708
Look, dear,
there is a kind of laughter...

1065
01:19:00,773 --> 01:19:05,017
...which a person learns
to hide his sorrow in life.

1066
01:19:05,644 --> 01:19:07,487
And there is another
kind of laughter...

1067
01:19:07,813 --> 01:19:10,589
...that helps a person
forget all his sorrow.

1068
01:19:11,617 --> 01:19:15,087
You've found this laughter
after meeting Guru.

1069
01:19:16,789 --> 01:19:18,268
You've found it in his love.

1070
01:19:20,159 --> 01:19:21,729
What's the use of this love...

1071
01:19:24,296 --> 01:19:26,469
...that will make him
cry after making him smile?

1072
01:19:29,101 --> 01:19:30,239
I'm not running away from him.

1073
01:19:32,738 --> 01:19:35,082
I'm just stopping him
from running after me.

1074
01:19:35,141 --> 01:19:35,642
Aisha!

1075
01:19:36,442 --> 01:19:37,284
Aisha!

1076
01:19:43,382 --> 01:19:44,383
Aisha!

1077
01:19:47,052 --> 01:19:48,190
Aisha!

1078
01:20:02,101 --> 01:20:02,704
Aisha.

1079
01:20:03,302 --> 01:20:04,007
Aisha!

1080
01:20:04,537 --> 01:20:05,345
Do you want to hear a joke?

1081
01:20:07,139 --> 01:20:08,618
Once, a man was drowning in the sea.

1082
01:20:09,575 --> 01:20:11,782
He started praying
to God to save him.

1083
01:20:11,844 --> 01:20:13,152
A fishing boat came.

1084
01:20:14,246 --> 01:20:15,520
He said, "Give me your hand."

1085
01:20:16,115 --> 01:20:17,753
The man said, "No.
God will save me."

1086
01:20:18,517 --> 01:20:19,655
Then a ship came.

1087
01:20:20,286 --> 01:20:21,424
The captain said, "Hold my hand."

1088
01:20:21,687 --> 01:20:24,167
He said, "No. God will save me."

1089
01:20:24,223 --> 01:20:25,531
The man drowned.

1090
01:20:26,358 --> 01:20:30,238
After his death, he asked God,
"Why didn't You save me?"

1091
01:20:30,296 --> 01:20:33,470
God said, "You think your
father sent that boat and ship?"

1092
01:20:38,704 --> 01:20:42,584
Aisha, I know that I might
not be able to save you from dying.

1093
01:20:44,076 --> 01:20:47,285
But by holding my hand,
you can keep me alive.

1094
01:20:49,648 --> 01:20:51,286
Hold my hand, Aisha.

1095
01:20:52,318 --> 01:20:54,423
And get me out of
darkness into light.

1096
01:20:56,322 --> 01:20:57,699
Hold my hand, Aisha!

1097
01:20:58,490 --> 01:21:00,663
Pull me out of darkness
into light, Aisha!

1098
01:21:04,430 --> 01:21:05,773
Aisha, don't go.

1099
01:21:07,566 --> 01:21:08,544
Aisha!

1100
01:21:10,102 --> 01:21:12,343
Aisha, don't go.

1101
01:21:21,480 --> 01:21:24,484
Aisha, don't leave me.

1102
01:21:27,219 --> 01:21:29,460
Aisha.

1103
01:22:17,836 --> 01:22:19,372
Hey! Who pulled the chain?

1104
01:22:27,313 --> 01:22:37,030
"Why does life comprise
of just a few moments?"

1105
01:22:37,823 --> 01:22:42,101
"Even centuries..."

1106
01:22:42,494 --> 01:22:47,409
"mare not enough for love."

1107
01:22:47,733 --> 01:22:53,081
"l want to ask God..."

1108
01:22:53,138 --> 01:22:58,087
"...for some more time."

1109
01:22:58,377 --> 01:23:03,053
"l want to stay here forever."

1110
01:23:03,315 --> 01:23:09,288
"l don't want to be away from you."

1111
01:23:09,355 --> 01:23:14,429
"When you're my companion."

1112
01:23:14,493 --> 01:23:19,374
"When you're my companion."

1113
01:23:19,732 --> 01:23:24,647
"No pain seems painful."

1114
01:23:25,237 --> 01:23:30,448
"When you're my companion."

1115
01:23:30,743 --> 01:23:33,155
After meeting Aisha,
I've realised...

1116
01:23:33,212 --> 01:23:35,055
...that it's very
easy to kill someone.

1117
01:23:35,681 --> 01:23:37,661
But it's very difficult
to save someone's life.

1118
01:23:40,686 --> 01:23:42,097
You may kill me if you want.

1119
01:23:43,088 --> 01:23:45,034
But I won't kill anyone again.

1120
01:24:01,673 --> 01:24:03,016
Go.

1121
01:24:05,277 --> 01:24:07,553
Go. I'm fine.

1122
01:24:13,185 --> 01:24:18,396
"Your smile is my strength."

1123
01:24:18,457 --> 01:24:23,702
"I've found hope because of it."

1124
01:24:23,762 --> 01:24:29,110
"No matter how much
the world torments me..."

1125
01:24:29,168 --> 01:24:33,708
"...l find solace in it."

1126
01:24:33,772 --> 01:24:39,245
"Life has become beautiful."

1127
01:24:39,311 --> 01:24:44,590
"This is heaven."

1128
01:24:44,650 --> 01:24:49,326
"When you're my companion."

1129
01:24:49,788 --> 01:24:54,533
"When you're my companion."

1130
01:24:55,127 --> 01:25:00,440
"No pain seems painful."

1131
01:25:00,499 --> 01:25:05,244
"When you're my companion."

1132
01:25:08,740 --> 01:25:11,084
These are Aisha's latest
pathological tests.

1133
01:25:29,328 --> 01:25:30,329
Here's your dairy.

1134
01:25:33,432 --> 01:25:35,605
You have time to fulfill
every wish of yours.

1135
01:25:37,102 --> 01:25:39,673
We have the time.
- Yes.

1136
01:25:40,539 --> 01:25:43,486
We will fulfill it together.
- Yes.

1137
01:25:46,178 --> 01:25:47,418
You have the rest
of your life, Aisha.

1138
01:25:51,483 --> 01:25:53,053
You have the rest of your life.

1139
01:25:55,020 --> 01:25:56,226
You will live, Aisha.

1140
01:25:57,556 --> 01:25:58,534
You will live, Aisha.

1141
01:25:59,791 --> 01:26:00,963
You will live.

1142
01:26:09,635 --> 01:26:14,584
"My life depends
on your heartbeats."

1143
01:26:15,040 --> 01:26:20,285
"Your desires are now my prayers."

1144
01:26:20,345 --> 01:26:25,556
"This is such an unusual bond."

1145
01:26:25,617 --> 01:26:30,293
"We're one now."

1146
01:26:30,355 --> 01:26:35,498
"l will come back to you."

1147
01:26:35,561 --> 01:26:41,102
"l promise you."
"Even if I die."

1148
01:26:41,166 --> 01:26:46,343
"When you're my companion."

1149
01:26:46,405 --> 01:26:50,683
"When you're my companion."

1150
01:26:51,610 --> 01:26:57,083
"No pain seems painful."

1151
01:26:57,149 --> 01:27:02,223
"When you're my companion."

1152
01:27:02,287 --> 01:27:06,997
"When you're my companion."

1153
01:27:07,626 --> 01:27:12,166
"When you're my companion."

1154
01:27:13,031 --> 01:27:18,242
"When you're my companion."

1155
01:27:18,303 --> 01:27:23,218
"When you're my companion."

1156
01:27:27,546 --> 01:27:28,320
ls this okay?

1157
01:27:28,814 --> 01:27:30,384
You look like a hero.

1158
01:27:30,449 --> 01:27:32,395
If I was the interviewer,
do you know what I would have done?

1159
01:27:34,519 --> 01:27:36,362
Wait. Let me get curd
and sugar for good luck.

1160
01:27:41,393 --> 01:27:42,303
Hi, Dr. Prema.

1161
01:27:42,594 --> 01:27:44,164
Aisha, your reports have come.

1162
01:27:45,330 --> 01:27:47,173
And they state that you're pregnant.

1163
01:27:49,268 --> 01:27:50,713
Aisha!

1164
01:27:51,403 --> 01:27:53,440
Are you there?
- Yeah.

1165
01:27:54,673 --> 01:27:55,651
Doctor...

1166
01:27:57,809 --> 01:28:00,585
Will my illness have
a negative effect on my baby?

1167
01:28:01,313 --> 01:28:04,851
No, Aisha.
Your baby is not in danger.

1168
01:28:04,983 --> 01:28:06,860
But I'm concerned about you.

1169
01:28:07,185 --> 01:28:10,689
Aisha, I don't think you have the
strength to give birth to this baby.

1170
01:28:11,490 --> 01:28:13,731
You've just come into
remission from your illness.

1171
01:28:14,259 --> 01:28:16,569
Your body is still very weak.

1172
01:28:17,195 --> 01:28:22,645
I think you should tell Guru
about your pregnancy and this risk.

1173
01:28:23,702 --> 01:28:26,683
'He's the father of this child.
He has a right to know.'

1174
01:28:27,172 --> 01:28:30,278
'You both must take this decision
and that too very quickly.'

1175
01:28:30,342 --> 01:28:32,219
Aisha, what are you doing?
It's behind.

1176
01:28:39,618 --> 01:28:40,323
Listen.

1177
01:28:46,258 --> 01:28:47,236
Best of luck.

1178
01:29:56,128 --> 01:29:59,735
Aisha, are you sure
you want this child?

1179
01:30:00,465 --> 01:30:02,308
Did you tell Guru?

1180
01:30:03,802 --> 01:30:05,281
I will tell him.

1181
01:30:07,339 --> 01:30:08,682
I'm just afraid...

1182
01:30:10,675 --> 01:30:15,249
...that if he feels that something might
happen to me because of this baby...

1183
01:30:17,182 --> 01:30:19,025
...then he'll try to stop me.

1184
01:30:19,618 --> 01:30:21,393
But his fear is justified, dear.

1185
01:30:26,458 --> 01:30:28,734
But this life that
I've got because of Guru...

1186
01:30:31,430 --> 01:30:37,779
...is playing
hide-and-seek with death.

1187
01:30:39,638 --> 01:30:42,118
It has to end someday.

1188
01:30:44,109 --> 01:30:46,715
Then my Guru will be
back into the darkness.

1189
01:30:50,382 --> 01:30:54,455
He will need someone then,
who'll hold his hand...

1190
01:30:54,519 --> 01:30:56,089
...and bring him into light.

1191
01:30:56,755 --> 01:30:58,359
And the one who'll hold his hand...

1192
01:31:00,091 --> 01:31:01,399
...will be our child.

1193
01:31:05,831 --> 01:31:07,469
My child, light and darkness means life.

1194
01:31:09,100 --> 01:31:12,479
Now, He'll show you the correct path.

1195
01:31:13,605 --> 01:31:16,552
The Lord's and my blessings
are always with you.

1196
01:31:21,580 --> 01:31:23,617
Have you worked somewhere earlier?

1197
01:31:30,722 --> 01:31:33,328
Actually, I shouldn't crack
jokes about God in front of God.

1198
01:31:33,391 --> 01:31:36,395
I'm sorry.
Don't mind, but I have no mind.

1199
01:31:36,461 --> 01:31:37,462
Catch“ catch.

1200
01:31:41,166 --> 01:31:42,270
Oh gosh!

1201
01:31:48,139 --> 01:31:51,746
Hey, mister!
Yes, I'm talking to you.

1202
01:31:52,277 --> 01:31:54,985
Aren't there enough potholes in the
city that you've dug another one?

1203
01:31:55,380 --> 01:31:57,326
For the past two weeks.

1204
01:31:57,382 --> 01:31:59,692
Those kids and my God were
saved by a hair's breadth today.

1205
01:31:59,751 --> 01:32:00,752
'All my dreams have shattered.'

1206
01:32:01,086 --> 01:32:03,396
'It's not your mistake,
I'm ill fated.'

1207
01:32:03,455 --> 01:32:05,594
'I had many choices.'

1208
01:32:05,657 --> 01:32:08,103
'But I was ill fated to marry you.'

1209
01:32:08,159 --> 01:32:10,002
'Middle class man.'

1210
01:32:10,829 --> 01:32:12,274
Don't worry, madam.

1211
01:32:12,664 --> 01:32:14,769
You won't have any
complaints henceforth.

1212
01:32:15,066 --> 01:32:17,546
Fine. Let's see.

1213
01:32:22,841 --> 01:32:23,683
Hello.

1214
01:32:24,476 --> 01:32:26,114
Do you want to hear the
bad news first or the worst news?

1215
01:32:26,511 --> 01:32:28,422
The bad news is that you'll
have to live without me every day...

1216
01:32:28,480 --> 01:32:29,754
...between 9 to 5 from now on.

1217
01:32:31,550 --> 01:32:33,393
And the worst news is that I
won't be able to live without you...

1218
01:32:33,451 --> 01:32:34,725
...between 9 to 5 from now on.

1219
01:32:35,287 --> 01:32:36,459
I got the job, Aisha.

1220
01:32:37,455 --> 01:32:38,433
I got the job.

1221
01:32:39,491 --> 01:32:40,629
I'm independent now.

1222
01:32:41,526 --> 01:32:45,406
Guru, there's something
that I have to say to you.

1223
01:32:45,764 --> 01:32:46,469
Tell me.

1224
01:32:47,465 --> 01:32:49,001
No. Come home first.

1225
01:32:49,067 --> 01:32:50,637
Tell me. I'm on my way home.

1226
01:32:51,036 --> 01:32:52,208
No, come home.

1227
01:32:55,273 --> 01:32:57,685
Hello. How did you get in?

1228
01:32:57,742 --> 01:32:58,584
Aisha?

1229
01:33:00,245 --> 01:33:01,246
What are you doing?
- Aisha?

1230
01:33:01,713 --> 01:33:03,192
Does anyone barge
into someone's house...

1231
01:33:03,248 --> 01:33:04,226
...without ringing the bell?

1232
01:33:04,282 --> 01:33:05,454
Get out of here!

1233
01:33:07,085 --> 01:33:08,587
Aisha, who's over there? Aisha!

1234
01:33:10,422 --> 01:33:12,527
Who is it? What happened, Aisha?

1235
01:33:13,391 --> 01:33:15,029
Hey! Aisha!

1236
01:33:15,393 --> 01:33:17,430
Listen! Whoever you are,
you're my enemy.

1237
01:33:17,796 --> 01:33:20,777
Guru!

1238
01:33:20,832 --> 01:33:22,470
It's not her mistake.
Spare her. Aisha!

1239
01:33:22,534 --> 01:33:25,242
Hey! Listen! Spare her. Aisha!

1240
01:33:26,104 --> 01:33:26,741
Aisha!
- Guru!

1241
01:33:27,072 --> 01:33:28,449
Stop! Taxi! Stop!

1242
01:33:28,506 --> 01:33:32,079
Aisha! - Guru!
- Aisha! I'm coming.

1243
01:33:34,179 --> 01:33:35,351
Help me.

1244
01:33:40,585 --> 01:33:41,620
I'm pregnant.

1245
01:33:44,422 --> 01:33:46,026
Please don't kill me.

1246
01:33:49,027 --> 01:33:51,098
I want to give birth to this baby.

1247
01:33:52,664 --> 01:33:54,075
I want to have this child.

1248
01:33:56,267 --> 01:33:57,575
Please don't kill me.

1249
01:33:57,636 --> 01:34:01,243
Stop! Taxi, stop.

1250
01:35:26,458 --> 01:35:29,234
Hurry up, deep-

1251
01:36:07,298 --> 01:36:08,208
HI.

1252
01:36:09,467 --> 01:36:12,505
Am I disturbing you?

1253
01:36:14,506 --> 01:36:17,976
I see. You were following Rakesh.

1254
01:36:19,043 --> 01:36:19,612
Go.

1255
01:36:22,213 --> 01:36:23,157
Run.

1256
01:36:24,516 --> 01:36:25,654
Run!

1257
01:36:26,785 --> 01:36:28,162
Hey, back off.

1258
01:36:28,419 --> 01:36:29,591
Back“

1259
01:36:29,654 --> 01:36:31,531
Just a minute, Madam. Madam.

1260
01:36:32,190 --> 01:36:33,134
Madam, do you know
where your husband is?

1261
01:36:33,691 --> 01:36:36,194
Please, let us go.

1262
01:36:36,261 --> 01:36:39,504
We didn't do anything.

1263
01:36:40,665 --> 01:36:42,702
I think there's
some misunderstandings.

1264
01:36:43,168 --> 01:36:45,239
My husband didn't do anything.

1265
01:36:45,303 --> 01:36:46,941
Do you remember what I told you?

1266
01:36:47,539 --> 01:36:50,486
Whenever you try to take
your revenge, I'll come in your way.

1267
01:36:51,209 --> 01:36:52,085
Do you remember!

1268
01:37:01,252 --> 01:37:03,289
I know you're not
scared of my bullet.

1269
01:37:04,455 --> 01:37:07,993
You know that if you follow him,
then the police will catch him.

1270
01:37:08,626 --> 01:37:12,039
His crime will be proved and your
revenge will be left incomplete.

1271
01:37:17,135 --> 01:37:19,308
<i>Rakes!“!</i>

1272
01:37:19,370 --> 01:37:21,247
Get inside.

1273
01:37:23,174 --> 01:37:25,381
The police will catch
Rakesh Mahadkar eventually.

1274
01:37:26,110 --> 01:37:27,987
Because his wife
is in their custody.

1275
01:37:28,513 --> 01:37:31,619
But for now,
let's go to the police station.

1276
01:37:32,483 --> 01:37:34,622
Someone's waiting
for you over there.

1277
01:37:47,065 --> 01:37:48,339
Hey!

1278
01:37:49,067 --> 01:37:50,341
You got beaten again?

1279
01:37:50,401 --> 01:37:51,402
Will you come with me to Mira Road?

1280
01:37:51,803 --> 01:37:53,282
Mira Road!

1281
01:37:53,338 --> 01:37:54,783
You've become a man!

1282
01:37:55,073 --> 01:37:56,211
Take me away from here.

1283
01:37:56,274 --> 01:38:00,620
After being beaten, you
want someone to heal your wounds.

1284
01:38:00,678 --> 01:38:05,184
Rakesh Mahadkar is the one
who killed women in the city.

1285
01:38:05,250 --> 01:38:06,490
He's absconding.

1286
01:38:06,551 --> 01:38:09,532
But police is making all
the efforts to nab him.

1287
01:38:10,655 --> 01:38:12,134
Look there.

1288
01:38:23,134 --> 01:38:29,642
"The world wants to
touch me in such a way..."

1289
01:38:32,410 --> 01:38:39,294
"was if I belong to them."

1290
01:38:41,519 --> 01:38:48,095
"The world looks at my beauty."

1291
01:38:50,795 --> 01:38:56,711
"No one understands
my helplessness."

1292
01:38:59,304 --> 01:39:06,244
"I'm shattered completely."

1293
01:39:06,811 --> 01:39:08,552
Wow!

1294
01:39:08,613 --> 01:39:16,623
"I've gone crazy in your love."

1295
01:39:17,655 --> 01:39:26,075
"I'm shattered completely."

1296
01:39:26,130 --> 01:39:27,108
Come on.

1297
01:39:27,165 --> 01:39:34,447
"I've gone crazy in your love."

1298
01:39:39,344 --> 01:39:41,051
You're lying.

1299
01:39:42,780 --> 01:39:44,555
Sir, Hold you.

1300
01:39:44,615 --> 01:39:48,028
The one who saved
my life was a saviour.

1301
01:39:48,086 --> 01:39:50,123
I couldn't recognise him.

1302
01:39:50,421 --> 01:39:51,695
Tell me something.

1303
01:39:52,090 --> 01:39:52,761
Note down the details.

1304
01:39:52,824 --> 01:39:54,098
Whether old or young...

1305
01:39:54,158 --> 01:39:56,365
...why doesn't any woman
testify against you?

1306
01:39:58,563 --> 01:40:01,772
Do you have a mole at
a special place in your body?

1307
01:40:03,267 --> 01:40:05,213
Wagle, take him in the custody.

1308
01:40:13,411 --> 01:40:17,382
"Some call me their pride."

1309
01:40:18,149 --> 01:40:22,029
"Some pay me a price."

1310
01:40:22,320 --> 01:40:26,359
"l smile at them."

1311
01:40:27,291 --> 01:40:31,637
"But I'm crying from within."

1312
01:40:31,696 --> 01:40:36,145
"You were priceless."

1313
01:40:36,200 --> 01:40:40,615
"You would talk a lot."

1314
01:40:41,506 --> 01:40:46,080
"Since you're quiet..."

1315
01:40:46,144 --> 01:40:52,322
"...you've taken all
my happiness away."

1316
01:40:57,121 --> 01:41:05,063
"I'm shattered."

1317
01:41:06,230 --> 01:41:14,775
"I'm ruined in your love."

1318
01:41:15,306 --> 01:41:22,087
"l belong lo you completely."

1319
01:41:24,615 --> 01:41:32,033
"I've been bought by you."

1320
01:41:50,808 --> 01:41:54,688
I always thought you were a loser.

1321
01:41:55,346 --> 01:41:59,294
But you proved me wrong.

1322
01:41:59,717 --> 01:42:04,063
Do you know how many
blessings you must have got...

1323
01:42:04,122 --> 01:42:06,124
...from those men
whose wives you killed?

1324
01:42:06,557 --> 01:42:10,198
But what did my friendship lack?

1325
01:42:10,661 --> 01:42:13,505
Why did you spare my wife?

1326
01:42:14,665 --> 01:42:16,736
Why are you sitting here?

1327
01:42:19,170 --> 01:42:21,081
Hey, handsome.
Will you come to the pool?

1328
01:42:21,139 --> 01:42:22,618
Hey, hot baby!

1329
01:42:24,108 --> 01:42:25,712
Tell me something.

1330
01:42:25,776 --> 01:42:30,191
Do you want to sing a solo song
with him or a duet with both of us?

1331
01:42:30,248 --> 01:42:34,492
Looks like your friend is neither
interested in a solo, nor in a duet.

1332
01:42:34,552 --> 01:42:39,501
I think he's either
impotent or he likes men.

1333
01:42:39,557 --> 01:42:45,098
You're talking too much.
But you don't know my friend.

1334
01:42:45,163 --> 01:42:49,270
Brother, you'll have to shut her up.

1335
01:42:49,333 --> 01:42:51,040
Come on. Have a drink.

1336
01:42:52,203 --> 01:42:53,739
Darling, where's the ice?

1337
01:42:54,172 --> 01:42:56,049
I'll just get it.

1338
01:42:57,241 --> 01:43:03,021
Hot girls forget to
get the coldest thing.

1339
01:43:05,316 --> 01:43:07,227
Who is this man who's after me?

1340
01:43:08,085 --> 01:43:11,498
He too is his wife's lover,
just like you.

1341
01:43:13,724 --> 01:43:17,729
I'm sure he's the husband
Of one of the women that you killed.

1342
01:43:17,795 --> 01:43:19,001
I'm sure.

1343
01:43:19,297 --> 01:43:20,298
100 percent.

1344
01:43:23,601 --> 01:43:25,547
He's playing with you.

1345
01:43:26,304 --> 01:43:29,615
Just as a lion plays
with his prey in the forest.

1346
01:43:30,374 --> 01:43:33,514
He catches it and then let's it go,
and then catches it again.

1347
01:43:34,145 --> 01:43:37,683
He chases it, catches it and
then let's it go again.

1348
01:43:40,084 --> 01:43:45,295
Until you keep running,
he'll keep chasing you.

1349
01:43:46,324 --> 01:43:50,636
The day you turn the tables,
you'll be the hunter.

1350
01:43:51,696 --> 01:43:53,403
And he'll be the prey.

1351
01:43:58,703 --> 01:44:00,614
'I won't let you die.'

1352
01:44:02,173 --> 01:44:04,210
'But I will still
kill you every day.'

1353
01:44:04,475 --> 01:44:07,217
'The more you try
to embrace death...'

1354
01:44:08,045 --> 01:44:09,991
'...the longer you'll live.'

1355
01:44:19,757 --> 01:44:21,737
'She was pregnant.'

1356
01:44:23,394 --> 01:44:24,998
'You killed my baby.
She was pregnant.'

1357
01:44:27,064 --> 01:44:28,236
'I'm pregnant.'

1358
01:44:28,599 --> 01:44:30,772
'I want to give birth to this baby.'

1359
01:44:32,470 --> 01:44:35,041
'Guru!'

1360
01:44:38,276 --> 01:44:40,051
My husband is the most kind...

1361
01:44:40,745 --> 01:44:45,057
...truthful and decent
man in the world.

1362
01:44:46,484 --> 01:44:48,054
He would murder someone...

1363
01:44:52,290 --> 01:44:53,564
That's impossible.

1364
01:44:54,158 --> 01:44:56,434
This is Guru's conspiracy.

1365
01:44:57,762 --> 01:45:02,074
Maybe, he killed his wife too.

1366
01:45:03,067 --> 01:45:05,069
And also those women.

1367
01:45:05,536 --> 01:45:06,981
I'm telling you.

1368
01:45:08,039 --> 01:45:09,746
Even the police
are involved in this.

1369
01:45:10,675 --> 01:45:12,279
They are involved with Guru.

1370
01:45:14,545 --> 01:45:18,516
They will kill my husband
and accuse him of everything.

1371
01:45:20,318 --> 01:45:23,128
I beg of you.

1372
01:45:23,788 --> 01:45:25,267
Please save my Rakesh.

1373
01:45:26,524 --> 01:45:27,696
Please save my Rakesh.

1374
01:45:30,127 --> 01:45:31,105
Lord!

1375
01:45:33,597 --> 01:45:36,077
Please send my Rakesh back to me.

1376
01:45:37,368 --> 01:45:39,041
I promise You.

1377
01:45:40,271 --> 01:45:44,242
I will never ask him to leave the house.
I'll never fight with him.

1378
01:45:47,311 --> 01:45:50,520
Please send my Rakesh
back to rne, God!

1379
01:45:58,089 --> 01:45:59,329
I love you, Rakesh.

1380
01:46:02,126 --> 01:46:03,104
Are you listening?

1381
01:46:04,462 --> 01:46:05,736
Please come back home.

1382
01:46:05,796 --> 01:46:06,536
Sulu..

1383
01:46:07,064 --> 01:46:08,634
Wherever you are,
please come home.

1384
01:46:10,634 --> 01:46:12,045
Come back.

1385
01:46:15,272 --> 01:46:16,717
I love you, Rakesh.

1386
01:46:16,774 --> 01:46:18,617
<i>Hove you, Sum.</i>

1387
01:46:20,778 --> 01:46:23,019
Yes, sir. He's been bailed.

1388
01:46:23,347 --> 01:46:25,657
I'll ask him to talk to you.
Hold on, sir.

1389
01:46:25,716 --> 01:46:28,424
Sir, phone.
It's Caesar sir's call, sir.

1390
01:46:33,824 --> 01:46:35,030
Aisha Verma.

1391
01:46:35,693 --> 01:46:39,470
Sai Kripa Society. Versova.

1392
01:46:40,831 --> 01:46:42,504
This was her address, right?

1393
01:46:43,200 --> 01:46:45,373
When I learnt that she's pregnant...

1394
01:46:46,237 --> 01:46:47,716
...l was as happy as a person gets...

1395
01:46:48,038 --> 01:46:50,609
...on knowing about
a buy 1 get 1 free offer.

1396
01:46:51,142 --> 01:46:53,679
Buy a shampoo and
get a soap bar free.

1397
01:46:54,345 --> 01:46:57,622
Kill the mother and the son
or the daughter is killed for free.

1398
01:46:58,315 --> 01:46:59,988
I won't punish you now.

1399
01:47:00,251 --> 01:47:01,423
I'll kill you.

1400
01:47:01,485 --> 01:47:05,365
Sorry, but my life
was on a limited offer.

1401
01:47:06,123 --> 01:47:08,034
Till stocks last only.

1402
01:47:08,526 --> 01:47:10,437
You wanted to play with me.

1403
01:47:11,162 --> 01:47:16,441
But now you'll realise what a big
mistake you made by sparing my life.

1404
01:47:16,767 --> 01:47:21,307
You want to take my Sulo
and my son away from me, right?

1405
01:47:21,372 --> 01:47:25,343
Before that, I'll lake the
rest of your family away from you.

1406
01:47:25,609 --> 01:47:29,580
You like to save people
from being killed by me, right?

1407
01:47:30,247 --> 01:47:31,590
To interfere.

1408
01:47:32,183 --> 01:47:34,060
But you have a strange talent.

1409
01:47:35,186 --> 01:47:36,665
You save the outsiders...

1410
01:47:37,755 --> 01:47:39,098
...but not your family.

1411
01:47:51,669 --> 01:47:54,343
Send police to Aisha's
father's house immediately.

1412
01:47:54,405 --> 01:47:56,248
Rakesh has come to know who I am.

1413
01:47:56,307 --> 01:47:59,117
Save him. I'll do whatever you want.
Just save him.

1414
01:48:19,430 --> 01:48:20,272
Tell me.

1415
01:48:24,635 --> 01:48:25,670
<i>S aw an“!</i>

1416
01:48:26,103 --> 01:48:27,776
Stop! Where are you going? Stop!

1417
01:48:27,838 --> 01:48:29,340
Where are you going?

1418
01:48:30,140 --> 01:48:32,416
Stop! - Stop!

1419
01:48:32,476 --> 01:48:35,480
Hey! Leave him. Let him come.

1420
01:48:44,288 --> 01:48:45,096
Don't kill me.

1421
01:49:21,859 --> 01:49:28,071
Sir, before Guru finds me
and kills me, I want to surrender.

1422
01:49:31,435 --> 01:49:32,573
Where are you right now?

1423
01:49:44,348 --> 01:49:46,760
I've seen many rogues
in my career as a policeman.

1424
01:49:47,084 --> 01:49:48,995
But I've never come
across such an insolent before.

1425
01:49:51,055 --> 01:49:52,534
If he gets away because of me...

1426
01:49:53,791 --> 01:49:55,998
...then neither God, nor
I will be able to forgive myself.

1427
01:49:58,429 --> 01:50:00,204
I've always been
an obstacle for you.

1428
01:50:01,799 --> 01:50:03,608
I've been the villain of your life.

1429
01:50:05,302 --> 01:50:06,713
But I'm saying this to you today.

1430
01:50:07,771 --> 01:50:10,581
Go and kill him.

1431
01:50:12,743 --> 01:50:15,519
He's taking shelter in the
place where he committed the crime.

1432
01:50:17,114 --> 01:50:19,151
He's in Aisha and your house.

1433
01:50:32,296 --> 01:50:33,741
Aisha was wrong.

1434
01:50:39,503 --> 01:50:44,077
I fought death and
got life back for Aisha.

1435
01:50:44,742 --> 01:50:47,188
I got light back into my life.

1436
01:50:50,247 --> 01:50:54,286
But by killing her,
you've spread darkness again.

1437
01:50:58,455 --> 01:50:59,763
Aisha was wrong.

1438
01:51:01,458 --> 01:51:04,132
No lamp can bring
light into this darkness.

1439
01:51:04,194 --> 01:51:07,073
Only the fire of your
pyre can bring light back.

1440
01:51:10,501 --> 01:51:11,775
Aisha was wrong.

1441
01:51:13,470 --> 01:51:15,040
Aisha was wrong.

1442
01:51:16,306 --> 01:51:17,546
Aisha was wrong.

1443
01:51:25,149 --> 01:51:28,756
Please let rne go!
Please forgive rne! Please!

1444
01:51:29,319 --> 01:51:31,230
Please forgive rne! Please!

1445
01:51:31,288 --> 01:51:34,565
Please forgive rne!
Please forgive rne!

1446
01:51:44,168 --> 01:51:47,581
This is what you
wanted to hear, right?

1447
01:51:47,638 --> 01:51:51,142
You wanted me to beg for my
life just as your Aisha did. Right?

1448
01:51:51,775 --> 01:51:54,221
I won't.

1449
01:51:54,812 --> 01:51:58,123
What did you think?
That you found me here?

1450
01:51:59,183 --> 01:51:59,661
No.

1451
01:51:59,717 --> 01:52:02,357
I brought you here.

1452
01:52:03,187 --> 01:52:04,996
I called that policeman.

1453
01:52:05,422 --> 01:52:09,529
I knew that you would get
furious on knowing my whereabouts.

1454
01:52:11,528 --> 01:52:14,407
The place where I killed your wife...

1455
01:52:15,499 --> 01:52:18,036
I knew you would come running to me.

1456
01:52:18,302 --> 01:52:21,181
I made you what I could never be.

1457
01:52:21,238 --> 01:52:22,717
Employee of the year.

1458
01:52:22,773 --> 01:52:24,081
MY Employee.

1459
01:52:27,144 --> 01:52:30,785
If the police had caught me,
I would go to prison.

1460
01:52:32,516 --> 01:52:34,325
All my crimes would be proved.

1461
01:52:35,119 --> 01:52:37,099
My Sulo would have hated me.

1462
01:52:37,154 --> 01:52:40,363
The end of my love story
wouldn't have been a happy one.

1463
01:52:47,564 --> 01:52:49,202
Take this. Take it.

1464
01:52:49,600 --> 01:52:50,305
Kill me.

1465
01:52:50,768 --> 01:52:52,111
You'll kill me...

1466
01:52:52,603 --> 01:52:57,313
...and I'll become
a hero for my Sulo.

1467
01:52:58,242 --> 01:52:59,243
Kill rne!

1468
01:53:01,078 --> 01:53:03,149
Please don't kill me!

1469
01:53:03,580 --> 01:53:05,116
I want to live!

1470
01:53:05,582 --> 01:53:07,528
I'm pregnant!

1471
01:53:08,352 --> 01:53:11,162
I want to give birth to my baby!

1472
01:53:11,755 --> 01:53:13,462
I'm pregnant!

1473
01:53:18,829 --> 01:53:19,671
Look at this.

1474
01:53:20,397 --> 01:53:24,345
You and I are like twin brothers
who were separated in childhood.

1475
01:53:24,768 --> 01:53:25,746
We're the same.

1476
01:53:26,303 --> 01:53:30,115
You want to kill me for your wife.

1477
01:53:30,174 --> 01:53:34,122
And I was killing
everyone for my wife.

1478
01:53:37,581 --> 01:53:42,121
You have no idea what
A big favour you've done on me.

1479
01:53:42,186 --> 01:53:43,688
Because of your revenge story...

1480
01:53:44,254 --> 01:53:49,067
...my Sulo said in front
of everyone that she loves me.

1481
01:53:50,160 --> 01:53:51,537
Thank you, my friend.

1482
01:53:56,733 --> 01:53:58,713
Hello, Guru,
Sir wants to talk to you.

1483
01:54:01,638 --> 01:54:04,084
I threw your wife from here.

1484
01:54:04,141 --> 01:54:05,142
Throw me down.

1485
01:54:05,542 --> 01:54:07,419
Avenge your wife's death.

1486
01:54:08,045 --> 01:54:11,083
Kill me. Let me win.

1487
01:54:11,148 --> 01:54:14,152
Let rne be the hero of
this story and be the villain!

1488
01:54:14,685 --> 01:54:15,629
<i>Rakes!“!</i>

1489
01:54:16,053 --> 01:54:17,054
My husband is not here.

1490
01:54:17,387 --> 01:54:19,389
Who are you?
What are you doing here?

1491

Why are you doing this to us?

1496
01:54:27,264 --> 01:54:30,268
Please spare my son!
I beg of you!

1497
01:54:30,334 --> 01:54:31,039
Guru.

1498
01:54:32,236 --> 01:54:34,409
Rakesh killed your wife.

1499
01:54:35,172 --> 01:54:37,152
What have we done to you?
- I'll kill his wife.

1500
01:54:37,207 --> 01:54:39,687
Sulo! - Please spare my son!
For God's sake!

<i>Sum...</i>

1517
01:55:24,521 --> 01:55:26,660
Now, it's his son's turn.

1518
01:55:27,357 --> 01:55:30,167
But you'll kill him. I won't.

1519
01:55:31,695 --> 01:55:35,507
I'm waiting for you
at RakesWs house, Guru.

1520
01:55:36,500 --> 01:55:37,535
<i>Come. - sum.</i>

You killed my Sulo.

You killed my Sulo!

1526
01:56:15,372 --> 01:56:17,113
On this road...

1527
01:56:19,142 --> 01:56:25,286
...this story began.

1528
01:56:28,452 --> 01:56:30,454
Your wife was right.

1529
01:56:31,221 --> 01:56:34,430
Someone would die over here someday.

1530
01:56:35,525 --> 01:56:37,061
On this road...

1531
01:56:37,127 --> 01:56:38,629
<i>...I'll</i> kill <i>you...</i>

...to this story.

1534
01:56:58,548 --> 01:56:59,993
Who did this?

1535
01:57:00,050 --> 01:57:01,222
I. I didn't do it.

1536
01:57:01,284 --> 01:57:02,991
Can't you drive properly?

1537
01:57:03,420 --> 01:57:04,694
There was a pothole.

1538
01:57:04,755 --> 01:57:06,029
Car lost its balance.

1539
01:57:06,623 --> 01:57:08,432
What happened?

1540
01:57:08,492 --> 01:57:10,733
He is dead.

1541
01:57:33,683 --> 01:57:35,253
'Darkness cannot
drive out darkness.'

1542
01:57:36,420 --> 01:57:38,024
'Only light can do that.'

1543
01:57:42,192 --> 01:57:43,569
'Hate cannot drive out hate.'

1544
01:57:44,494 --> 01:57:45,996
'Only love can do that.'

1545
01:57:49,699 --> 01:57:52,612
'That 8-year-old child who
was under the bed out of fear...'

1546
01:57:53,570 --> 01:57:55,015
'...is still over there.'

1547
01:58:01,445 --> 01:58:03,482
'He only needs someone's hand.'

1548
01:58:06,450 --> 01:58:07,793
'Someone-'s support.'

1549
01:58:14,124 --> 01:58:17,401
'Someone who can pull him out of the
darkness and bring him to light.'

1550
01:58:26,269 --> 01:58:28,715
'Unless we share
someone else's pain...'

1551

'...we can never relieve
ourselves of pain.'

1552
01:59:32,335 --> 01:59:33,678
Do you want to hear a joke?

1553
01:59:36,239 --> 01:59:37,684
Once, there was a beggar.

1554
01:59:38,141 --> 01:59:40,121
He called up in the five star hotel“

1555

1557
01:59:45,549 --> 01:59:46,619
Waiter asked him...

1558

..in whose name
the order shall be placed?

1559
01:59:48,251 --> 01:59:49,423
Beggar said“
