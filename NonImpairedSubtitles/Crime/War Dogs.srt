1
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:07,963
Please! Please!

2
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:18,091
I'm sorry, I don't speak Albanian!

3
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:21,770
Stop! I don't understand!

4
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:32,205
Do you understand now?

5
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:36,763
That's a Jericho 941 pointed at my head.

6
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:40,250
You can get one
on the black market for $300.

7
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:41,441
Yeah.

8
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:44,041
It is a very reliable weapon.

9
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:48,002
My name is David Packouz.

10
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:50,407
And I'm an international arms dealer.

11
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:57,727
What do you know about war?

12
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:01,362
They'll tell you it's about
patriotism, democracy

13
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:04,080
or some shit about the other guy
hating our freedom.

14
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:07,287
But you want to know
what it's really about?

15
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:09,530
What do you see?

16
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:13,446
A kid from Arkansas doing his
patriotic duty to defend his country?

17
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:16,248
I see a helmet, fire-retardant gloves,

18
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:18,408
body armor, and an M16.

19
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:21,651
I see $17,500.

20
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:24,971
That's what it costs to outfit
one American soldier.

21
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:28,201
Over two million soldiers

22
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:30,289
fought in Iraq and Afghanistan.

23
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:36,400
It cost the American taxpayer
$4.5 billion each year

24
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:38,284
just to pay the air conditioning bills

25
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:40,130
for those wars.

26
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:43,248
And that's what war is really about.

27
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:47,002
War is an economy.

28
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,371
Anybody who tells you otherwise

29
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:52,967
is either in on it or stupid.

30
00:02:57,880 --> 00:02:59,484
But I didn't know that yet.

31
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:04,726
Back then, I didn't know anything.

32
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:30,930
You can't park here.

33
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:37,006
Hey, man. I just got
a client at 2150, Mr. Shore.

34
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:38,846
I'm a few minutes early.

35
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:41,168
Yeah? It's a gated community.

36
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:42,526
You still can't park here.

37
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:46,402
You probably shouldn't
smoke that here, either.

38
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:51,201
Okay. Thanks.

39
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,480
There's a lot I could say
about this period in my life

40
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:13,842
that would give context to this story.

41
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:19,401
I could tell you how

42
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,443
I dropped out of college
after one semester.

43
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:24,930
- How's that left quad doing?
- It's still sore.

44
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:27,481
Had a falling out with my parents.

45
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:31,729
How I either quit or got fired
from six different jobs.

46
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:35,527
- That's it.
- All right. There we go.

47
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:41,326
But looking back I think the most
important thing to understand is

48
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:44,401
I was completely lost.

49
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:56,891
Sorry. It fell.

50
00:04:58,200 --> 00:04:59,884
That's okay, Gary.

51
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:08,450
I was 22 years old

52
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:12,725
massaging rich dudes in Miami Beach
for 75 bucks an hour.

53
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:16,324
But I'd had enough.

54
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:18,807
It was time to change shit up.

55
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:23,362
And I had a big idea.

56
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:43,405
My plan was to sell
quality bed sheets wholesale

57
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:45,523
to all the retirement homes
in South Florida.

58
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,370
And there were hundreds of them.

59
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:53,609
- It feels really soft.
- It should.

60
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:56,087
It's Egyptian cotton, 400 thread count.

61
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:59,011
I mean, it's pretty much top of the line
for institutional use.

62
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:01,722
I don't know. It seems excessive.

63
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:05,407
Well, at $29 per unit,
it's far from excessive.

64
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:09,571
David, do you know the average age
of a resident here at Hilldale?

65
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:12,046
Um, no, I don't.

66
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:14,447
- Eighty-two years old.
- Wow.

67
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:17,846
Have you ever seen the skin
on an 82-year-old man?

68
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:20,168
Have you ever felt it?

69
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:22,289
Yeah. Actually,
I'm a certified massage therapist

70
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:24,124
and a lot of my clients are elderly.

71
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:25,407
Then you should know.

72
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:27,410
These sheets,

73
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:31,082
it would be like wrapping
a lizard in cashmere.

74
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:32,971
Would you do that?

75
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:36,170
Would you wrap a lizard in cashmere?

76
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:39,568
I guess not.

77
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:42,127
Then why would you expect me to?

78
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:47,248
My nephew.

79
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:49,285
He's good, right?

80
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:56,208
I'd sunk my entire life savings
into 65 cases of premium bed sheets

81
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:58,880
but I overlooked one crucial factor.

82
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:02,646
No one really cares about old people.

83
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:07,481
Why don't you just sell them back?

84
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:10,251
It doesn't work like that.
I bought them in bulk.

85
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,525
I'm so fucked.

86
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:14,165
You're not fucked.

87
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:16,010
Pete's fucked.

88
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:18,489
He's dead.

89
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:24,967
Holy shit. Is that Efraim?

90
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:28,440
Yeah.

91
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:31,048
I thought he was still in LA.

92
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:32,926
Me too.

93
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:34,730
- He was a great friend.
- Thank you.

94
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:38,205
He looks so tan.

95
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:42,602
Efraim Diveroli
was my best friend growing up.

96
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:46,808
But I hadn't seen him since he was shipped
off to live with his uncle in 10th grade.

97
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:51,162
I think our parents wanted to keep us
as far apart as possible.

98
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:56,367
There is no table of contents
in the Book of Life.

99
00:07:57,160 --> 00:08:00,767
We don't know if we're at the beginning
of a new chapter, or the end of a story.

100
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:06,847
Which is why we must be grateful
every time the page turns.

101
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:09,250
Did you come back just for this?

102
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:11,761
Fuck no! I barely knew Pete.

103
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:13,849
I was hoping to see you here.

104
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:16,008
You know your mom
wouldn't give me your number?

105
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:17,247
What, did you call my house?

106
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:19,727
No, I was fucking her.

107
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:22,844
She still hates me, huh?

108
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:24,485
Yeah, most likely.

109
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:26,205
I missed you, bro.

110
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:27,521
Yeah, me too.

111
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:29,650
Let's go for a ride.

112
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:30,927
Uh...

113
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:33,009
I can't. I got a client at 4:00.

114
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:34,890
Fuck that shit. Cancel it.

115
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:36,650
Your boy's back in town.

116
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:39,171
Come on!

117
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:48,926
So, what happened with LA, man?

118
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:50,121
Why did you move back?

119
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:52,203
Oh, you know I was working
for my uncle, right?

120
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:54,971
Yeah, I heard that you were, like,
a gun dealer or something.

121
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:56,121
Pretty much. I mean,

122
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:59,648
we'd buy seized weapons at police auctions
and resell them on the Internet.

123
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:00,841
Cool.

124
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:04,801
It was cool until my uncle
scumbagged me over 70 grand.

125
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,764
Holy shit. Seventy grand?

126
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:09,804
Whatever. Fuck him.
I made a bunch of money.

127
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,890
I decided I'd come back to Miami,
start up my own shop.

128
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:14,320
Cool.

129
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:16,811
Yo, where's this guy live?

130
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,162
It's, like, five more minutes.
You got somewhere you gotta be?

131
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:20,887
No.

132
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:23,407
All right. So, I can't figure out
which is worse.

133
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:25,807
The fact that you sell
bed sheets to old age homes

134
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:27,644
or that you jerk guys off for money.

135
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:31,322
For the record,
I'm a licensed massage therapist, okay?

136
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:32,851
Totally legit.

137
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:36,249
Okay. But at the end,
the guys have to come, right?

138
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:37,885
Like, on your chest or whatever?

139
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:40,082
You know what? Fuck you.

140
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:42,089
Fuck you, buddy.

141
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:45,045
Bro, do you remember the last time
we went to buy weed together?

142
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:47,288
Of course I do. It was fucking traumatic.

143
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:50,046
Yeah, but do you remember the next day,
when we walked into school

144
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:52,208
and everybody knew that we got arrested?

145
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:54,323
Yeah, we were gangsters, bro.

146
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:56,841
We thought we ran South Beach.

147
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:58,849
We did run yeshiva.

148
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:00,849
We didn't take shit from anyone.

149
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:03,646
Yeah, I miss that.

150
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:05,127
You miss yeshiva?

151
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:07,129
No, I miss

152
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:09,522
not taking shit from anyone.

153
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:22,401
Yo!

154
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:26,686
He out. You looking for weed?

155
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:29,202
Depends. You got good shit?

156
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:32,364
Put it this way. I sell him his shit.

157
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:36,644
What's up with this nigga, man?

158
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:38,285
Cool. Can you do an ounce?

159
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:40,767
Yeah, no sweat. Three bills.

160
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:43,211
Three hundred. I like it.

161
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:45,721
You get the better price
when you come direct to the distributor.

162
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:47,365
I guess so.

163
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:49,686
All right.

164
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:52,401
Yeah, so, she opened the door.

165
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:54,289
And I'm like, "Yo. Chill.
I ain't about that drama."

166
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:55,521
You know what I mean?

167
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:56,881
"I know you got
another nigga in the crib."

168
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:58,206
What's up?

169
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,201
What?

170
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:03,285
Can I get the shit?

171
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:04,811
What shit?

172
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:10,601
I just gave you $300 for some weed.

173
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:14,205
Any of you niggas ever
seen this motherfucker before?

174
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:15,566
I ain't seen shit.

175
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:20,202
Man, get the fuck out of here.

176
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:31,166
- All right. All right, okay.
- Yeah, yeah.

177
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:33,241
This white boy wild.

178
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:34,726
Parachute pants.

179
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:36,485
Looking like Jay Leno and shit.

180
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:38,405
Look like he going to church.

181
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:48,051
Yo, yo, hold up, hold up, man.

182
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:49,526
- What the fuck.
- Shit!

183
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:55,880
Come on! Where's everybody going?

184
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:57,923
I thought we were gonna hang out.

185
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,525
What a bunch of assholes.

186
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:05,490
What the fuck was that? Are you crazy?

187
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:06,641
It's cool, bro.

188
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:09,451
I have a Class 3 Firearms license.

189
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:11,530
- Huh?
- Come on, get in.

190
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:13,370
I know another dealer nearby.

191
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:19,286
It's weird. We were the same age,
but I always looked up to Efraim.

192
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:22,726
When life kicked me, I stayed down.

193
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,083
But not Efraim. He kicked back.

194
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:29,123
Mr. President, we want to thank you

195
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:30,731
for visiting us here today.

196
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:33,207
We are honored to be serving our country,

197
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:35,044
and proud to welcome you,

198
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:37,447
our wartime Commander in Chief...

199
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:40,762
- Hey.
- Hey, sweetie.

200
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:43,610
How was the funeral?

201
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:45,643
It was amazing.

202
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:51,690
Oh, my God. You're so stoned, aren't you?

203
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:53,450
Huh? What?

204
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:56,246
You just described a funeral as "amazing."

205
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:58,727
What? No. The funeral was really sad.

206
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:00,883
Yeah, everyone was totally bummed out.

207
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:03,401
But I ran into my friend from growing up.

208
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:05,841
The guy I told you about. Efraim Diveroli?

209
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:08,649
The one you got arrested with?

210
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:12,328
Yeah. I mean, we did
some other stuff too, but...

211
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:14,722
Anyway, he just moved back to Miami.

212
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:16,285
That's great, right?

213
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:19,000
Yeah. I'm supposed
to swing by his office tomorrow.

214
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:20,770
We're gonna grab lunch.

215
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:23,324
- Okay.
- Are you hungry?

216
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:24,760
- Hmm?
- I'm so hungry.

217
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:27,641
- We don't have much here.
- Oh.

218
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:31,002
- I mean, we have pizza.
- Really?

219
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:32,924
- And nachos.
- We have nachos?

220
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:34,730
And ice cream.

221
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:37,207
Wait, what? We never have ice cream.

222
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:41,049
You're fucking with me, aren't you?

223
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:43,931
That is so mean.

224
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:47,250
That was so easy.

225
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:54,121
Hello?

226
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:56,971
Hello, Mr. Borstein.
This is David Packouz.

227
00:13:57,160 --> 00:13:58,685
You told me to call today at 11:00.

228
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:02,521
I have those bed sheets with me,
and I would love for you to take a look.

229
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:07,285
Uh, sir, if you give me the chance

230
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:09,369
I am confident that your residents

231
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:10,971
will appreciate the difference.

232
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:14,921
It's an expense we can't justify,
and we're just not interested.

233
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:16,366
Uh-huh.

234
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:18,762
Okay, well, thank you for your time.

235
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:33,081
Yeah, this is contract specialist

236
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:35,806
Lindsey Michaels
from Army Command, Picatinny.

237
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:42,571
That's right.

238
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:45,890
Yeah, I sent out a solicitation
for some 249s for Basra

239
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:48,447
and we seem to have
misplaced your paperwork.

240
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:53,642
Great. So if you can go ahead
and just re-email me those numbers.

241
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:56,047
Actually, you know what?
On second thought,

242
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:57,890
we're about to make
a decision on those RFPs.

243
00:14:58,120 --> 00:15:02,367
Why don't you go ahead and just give me
your bid while I got you here on the phone?

244
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:04,447
Uh-huh.

245
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:06,245
And does that include mags?

246
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:09,088
Great. Yes, sir.

247
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:12,200
You keep supplying the guns,
we'll keep killing the bad guys.

248
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:14,285
God bless you.

249
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:15,970
What a fucking tool. What's up, bro?

250
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:18,367
Yo, what's up, man?
What was that all about?

251
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:20,682
Oh, that was me
impersonating an army officer.

252
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:22,689
Really? What for?

253
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:25,042
To find out what my competitor's
bidding on a contract.

254
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:27,050
It's fucking genius.

255
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:30,688
I thought that you said you sold, like,
seized weapons to gun nuts on the Internet.

256
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:32,006
Not anymore.

257
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:33,969
Now I only sell to one gun nut.

258
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:35,531
Oh, yeah? Which one?

259
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:38,483
The U.S. Military, motherfucker.

260
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:43,010
Wanna do a bong hit?

261
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:58,606
Pretty sick, huh?

262
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:01,201
So what, you sell these things
to the Pentagon?

263
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:03,767
I sell all kinds of shit to the Pentagon.

264
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:06,725
Guns, bullets, body armor.

265
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:11,369
Last week, I shipped 400 gas masks
to American Special Forces in Iraq.

266
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:12,881
No shit.

267
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:16,523
How long you been doing this for?

268
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:18,245
Two, three months.

269
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:20,408
And you make good money?

270
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:22,729
Oh! Fuck, man.

271
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:25,725
Put it this way.
I did over 200K in the past eight weeks.

272
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:29,162
And I'm only telling you that
because you're my boy.

273
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:30,486
I'm not bragging.

274
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:33,085
Holy shit.

275
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:34,725
Yeah. Check this out.

276
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:39,450
Fed Biz Opps stands for
Federal Business Opportunities.

277
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:41,768
Think eBay, but for war.

278
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:44,921
- They buy tanks on here?
- Bro, they buy everything on here.

279
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:46,521
It was crazy.

280
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:48,802
The government had a public website

281
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:52,447
containing every military contract
currently up for bidding.

282
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:55,126
But I skip the big ticket items,
and look for the small-ball shit

283
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:57,601
that giant defense contractors ignore.

284
00:16:57,800 --> 00:17:00,121
Everybody's fighting over the same pie.

285
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:01,845
But they're ignoring the crumbs.

286
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:04,481
I live on crumbs, like a rat.

287
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:08,328
And when you're dealing with the Pentagon,
crumbs are worth millions.

288
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:11,321
These listings seemed to go on forever.

289
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:14,246
And according to Efraim, they did.

290
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:18,402
Thanks, man.

291
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:20,241
So, I don't get it.

292
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:22,090
If there's an entire defense industry,

293
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:25,124
why would the Pentagon
want to buy anything from you?

294
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:27,931
They don't want to, they have to.

295
00:17:28,120 --> 00:17:29,531
Remember Little League?

296
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:32,604
How, at the end of the season,
they'd give out that big MVP trophy

297
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:34,165
and that one kid would always win it?

298
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:35,646
Yeah, Evan Talbot.

299
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:38,286
Right. But then, one year,
somebody's mom complained?

300
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:41,802
Then they had to give everybody
a little trophy so they wouldn't feel bad?

301
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:44,804
Even that fat retarded kid,
Robbie Friedman, got one.

302
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,002
That's kind of like what's happening here.

303
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:49,284
I'm still confused, man.

304
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:52,643
The Pentagon fucked up
when they were rebuilding the Iraqi Army.

305
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:57,010
They gave all these no-bid contracts
to Cheney's boys, and they got caught.

306
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:59,686
So Bush started this initiative
to level the playing field

307
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:03,322
and now every Pentagon purchase,
every gun, every grenade,

308
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:07,246
every bullet, gets offered to
small businesses for bidding.

309
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:10,330
And sure, the big dogs
still get the big trophies.

310
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:12,847
But the Pentagon's
got to give little trophies

311
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,480
to all the Robbie Friedmans of the world.

312
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:17,728
So, basically, you're a fat retarded kid.

313
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:20,566
Bro, I'm the fattest and most retarded.

314
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:27,568
In a speech today, President Bush
said that contrary to reports

315
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:30,684
he has no plans to attack Iran.

316
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:32,571
The President said, "That's ridiculous.

317
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:35,081
"We didn't even have plans
when we attacked Iraq. "

318
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:38,161
David.

319
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:39,521
Yeah?

320
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:45,887
Remember a few weeks ago, in the car
on the way home from my mom's house?

321
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:48,367
Yes. Yes, I do.

322
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:52,486
Well, this happened.

323
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:06,164
How the fuck are you going to feed a baby?

324
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:09,170
Have you even thought about this?

325
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:10,361
What are you going to do?

326
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:12,085
Jerk men off the rest of your life?

327
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:15,841
Yeah, that's the plan.
I'm gonna feed my kid by jerking men off.

328
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:17,566
Sorry.

329
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:19,723
Okay, good. Well, at least
you thought it through.

330
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:21,445
It's not funny.

331
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:24,601
Dude, I am so fucked.

332
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:29,928
I think you should come work for me.

333
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:31,890
What are you talking about?

334
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:34,003
Seriously, I need the help.

335
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:36,326
David, look at me.

336
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:40,168
Bush opened the floodgates in Iraq.

337
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:43,210
It's a fucking gold rush.

338
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:45,171
That's really nice of you, Efraim.

339
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:47,203
Fuck nice! Who cares about nice?

340
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:49,368
I've been looking to bring
somebody on for a while now.

341
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:52,040
The problem is, I don't trust anyone.

342
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:54,530
But you're my boy.

343
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:59,127
I mean, no offense,
but I'm against this war.

344
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:03,041
Me and Iz are going to rallies
and signing petitions.

345
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:04,890
Yeah, dude, I'm against the war too.

346
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:06,605
I fucking hate Bush.

347
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:10,205
But this isn't about being pro-war.

348
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:12,448
The war is happening.

349
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:14,688
This is about being pro-money.

350
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:17,770
The more Efraim talked,
the more it made sense.

351
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:19,928
Besides, compared to my other prospects,

352
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:22,487
this was the chance of a lifetime.

353
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:26,287
My only issue was, what would I tell Iz?

354
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:28,568
I think it's a great idea.

355
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:30,565
So I lied.

356
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:33,525
You know I've always
believed in this business.

357
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:36,726
I told her that Efraim
had great contacts in the government.

358
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:38,485
And instead of selling bed sheets

359
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:40,808
to penny-pinching retirement homes

360
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,480
we'd now be selling sheets
to the free-spending,

361
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:45,768
overfunded U.S. Military.

362
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:47,530
It's genius.

363
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:54,769
I had to lie. Iz hated the war.

364
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:57,965
She had two cousins serving in Iraq.

365
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:03,525
She also hated the mountain of bed sheets
that were taking up half our apartment.

366
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:14,204
I spent the next six weeks
in a crash course on arms dealing.

367
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:16,323
The Herstal 556 light machine gun.

368
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:18,727
Belgian, but made under license
in lots of places.

369
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:21,725
When it came to this shit,
Efraim knew everything.

370
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:25,089
Makes, models, weights, where it was made.

371
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:27,965
Remember, there's been an arms embargo
against China since Tiananmen Square.

372
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:31,081
And if there was an angle to
be played, he knew about that too.

373
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:33,362
You have to read between
the lines with this stuff.

374
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:36,171
All the money is made between the lines.

375
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:39,286
I'd spend my entire day
scouring the government's website,

376
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:43,161
searching for overlooked contracts
that we could squeeze our way into.

377
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:45,564
Hey, I think I got something.

378
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:47,770
Hey, Georgia, I gotta call you back.

379
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:49,405
And then, in the middle of the night

380
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:51,841
we'd be back in the office,
working the phones.

381
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:53,361
Forging relationships

382
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:56,962
with weapon manufacturers
all over Eastern Europe.

383
00:21:57,160 --> 00:21:59,766
No, David Packouz from AEY.

384
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:04,889
I told Iz we were doing conference calls
with sheet suppliers in Pakistan.

385
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:09,242
They called guys like us war dogs.

386
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:11,681
Bottom feeders who make money off of war

387
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:14,087
without ever stepping foot
on the battlefield.

388
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:18,162
It was meant to be derogatory,
but we kinda liked it.

389
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:21,125
You fucking scumbag piece of shit!

390
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:24,484
Drown, motherfucker, drown!

391
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:31,041
Very nice.

392
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:34,682
Ralph Slutsky was Efraim's silent partner.

393
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:37,571
He was a local businessman

394
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:40,809
who owned 14 dry cleaners
all across Miami.

395
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:43,930
Why didn't anybody tell me
the mister is broken?

396
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:48,929
Ralph put up the money to back the deals
in exchange for 25% of the company.

397
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:53,327
Or at least what he thought was 25%.

398
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:55,802
We're doing God's work, Ralph.

399
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,809
We really are.

400
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,048
You know, every Jew owes a debt to Israel.

401
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:02,846
In my mind, this is not
a metaphorical debt.

402
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:06,209
Ralph was under the impression
that Efraim was an observant Jew

403
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:07,851
who only dealt arms as a means

404
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:09,963
to protect Israel from her enemies.

405
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:11,804
Beautifully said.

406
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:14,447
Did you happen to catch
last Friday's Torah portion?

407
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:17,286
- One of my favorites.
- Same here.

408
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:20,086
It reminds me so much
of this story I once read.

409
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:22,965
About a young man traveling to Pinsk.

410
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:25,647
And that was Efraim's genius.

411
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:29,202
He would figure out
who someone wanted him to be

412
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:32,290
and he would become that person.

413
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:36,646
Ah!

414
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:43,441
And he's got, like, 20,000 of them.

415
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:45,290
Great. Where did you find this guy?

416
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:47,568
You remember Victor in the Ukraine?

417
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:49,046
Yeah, the one with the Mk3s?

418
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:52,204
Yeah. He turned me
on to this company in Cyprus.

419
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:54,801
It's run by this guy, Henry Girard.

420
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,081
Henry Girard?

421
00:23:57,160 --> 00:23:58,446
Yeah, you know him?

422
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:00,722
You spoke to Henry Girard?

423
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:03,167
A couple of times. Why? Who is he?

424
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:06,887
Dude, for the last 20 years,
this guy has basically supplied

425
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:09,447
both sides of every conflict
on the planet.

426
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:11,165
He's a fucking animal.

427
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:14,045
Really? Why is he calling me?

428
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:16,129
Because he's a fucking animal.

429
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:19,171
It's all money and it all matters.

430
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:21,124
Hey, mami, where are you going?

431
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:23,364
I'm trying to find my friends.

432
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:24,886
You want to make some money?

433
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:26,241
Excuse me?

434
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:28,847
I'll give you $1,000 right now

435
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:30,929
if we fast forward to our third date.

436
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:32,691
What does that even mean?

437
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:36,248
It means we just had a great dinner,
maybe met your friends for some drinks

438
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:38,249
and now you're about to blow me in my car.

439
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:39,805
Can we just get right to that part?

440
00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:41,451
Who the fuck are you?

441
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:43,005
Efraim Diveroli.

442
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:44,281
That's my best friend, David.

443
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:46,084
And we're international arms dealers.

444
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:47,406
But you already know that

445
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:49,409
because we're on our third date.

446
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:52,124
- What's going on?
- Nothing, bro.

447
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:53,970
I'm about to get out of here with my girl.

448
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:57,684
What the fuck, man!

449
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:09,363
Oh, my God.

450
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:12,363
That guy was not fucking around.

451
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:16,728
Yeah, you probably should have
picked a different girl.

452
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:19,526
Fuck that, it almost worked.

453
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:24,442
Hey, do you remember when you fought
Eric Moscowitz in sixth grade?

454
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:28,047
Yeah, he did that windmill thing
with his arms.

455
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:30,208
That was the sickest. He was unbeatable.

456
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:31,890
You remember that shit?

457
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:34,125
That's it.

458
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:36,243
Dude, he would have killed me
if you didn't jump in.

459
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:38,530
Probably. Mmm.

460
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:43,685
Hey, I never said "thank you."

461
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:45,924
For everything.

462
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:48,123
Come on, you know how much
you've helped me out lately.

463
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:51,604
It's cool. You don't have to
make it weird, all right?

464
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:55,130
Hey, can we order some food?

465
00:25:56,560 --> 00:25:58,483
Mami, come on.
I could have gone to Cuba and back.

466
00:25:58,680 --> 00:26:00,569
Met the family,
grabbed a couple sandwiches.

467
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:01,886
I'd be done by now.

468
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:03,281
Hello?

469
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:08,323
Yes, sir. Sorry, I wasn't expecting
a work call this late.

470
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:11,091
Right, of course.
It's 9:00 a.m. in Baghdad.

471
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:12,721
Who is it?

472
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:15,122
That's great news, Captain Santos.

473
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:18,526
Yes, sir.

474
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:19,966
We're going to get right on that.

475
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:21,241
Thank you. Bye.

476
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:22,441
What?

477
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:26,321
We just got the Beretta deal.

478
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:27,766
Get the fuck out of here.

479
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:29,281
I swear to God.

480
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:31,363
The Beretta deal was massive.

481
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:35,360
It was 10 times bigger
than anything we'd closed so far.

482
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:37,562
This was next level shit.

483
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:39,410
That's what I'm fucking talking about!

484
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:41,967
That's real money, motherfucker! Fuck!

485
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:44,369
Do you realize we're going to make 600K

486
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:45,891
on this fucking thing?

487
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:47,121
Holy shit.

488
00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:51,086
David, your 30% is $180,000.

489
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:53,403
Holy fucking shit!

490
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:56,120
It was amazing.

491
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:57,890
I'd been working with Efraim
for two months

492
00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:00,162
and was already about to make more money

493
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:02,124
than a lifetime of massages.

494
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:15,881
Listen.

495
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,206
What is that?

496
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:21,845
That's your baby's heartbeat.

497
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:23,807
Wow.

498
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:27,243
Can you believe how fast it is?

499
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:30,328
- Is that normal?
- Totally normal.

500
00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:33,490
Fetuses have a much faster heart rate
than we do.

501
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:37,401
Look.

502
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:41,281
So, you guys want to know the sex?

503
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:45,530
We keep going back and forth on it.

504
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:49,083
- What do you think?
- Um...

505
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:53,009
This is work. I have to take it.

506
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:54,281
I'm so sorry.

507
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:56,646
This is David.

508
00:27:56,840 --> 00:27:58,649
This is Captain Santos in Baghdad

509
00:27:58,840 --> 00:28:01,002
checking on the delivery
status of my Berettas.

510
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:02,924
Captain, good to hear from you.

511
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:05,288
Yes, we are on target. All good.

512
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:06,960
Great. I was worried

513
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:09,601
those guns were coming
direct out of Italy.

514
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:11,882
Absolutely. They are, sir.

515
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:15,082
Packouz, please tell me

516
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:17,931
you're aware of the legislation
the Italians passed last week.

517
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:20,801
The one banning
all arms shipments to Iraq.

518
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:23,931
I had no clue what he was talking about.

519
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:26,851
But this was a huge fucking problem.

520
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:28,889
Berettas are an Italian gun.

521
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:31,890
Made and manufactured in Italy.

522
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:33,121
Uh...

523
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:34,646
Of course.

524
00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:36,251
I am. I've been on the phone

525
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:38,403
for the last three days,
making other arrangements.

526
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:41,285
Great. That's what I wanted to hear.

527
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:43,926
Iraqi police force is depending on you.

528
00:28:44,120 --> 00:28:46,361
Well, you tell them AEY
has got them covered.

529
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:49,291
- Outstanding.
- Thanks, Captain. Talk soon.

530
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:57,090
Everything okay?

531
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:00,481
Yeah. Yeah, everything's fine.

532
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:03,209
What happened? We done already?

533
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:06,085
Yeah. Guess what?

534
00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:09,885
It's a girl.

535
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:16,121
Baby.

536
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:27,725
Okay. At least I hit something.

537
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:29,843
Seriously, what the fuck
are we going to do?

538
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:31,810
Relax, bro.

539
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:34,247
Should I just call him back
and tell him the truth?

540
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:38,491
When does telling the truth
ever help anybody?

541
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:40,648
Efraim, we can't dick around with this guy

542
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:41,927
and then not deliver.

543
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:44,566
We're going to deliver.
I already figured it out.

544
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:45,847
We use Jordan.

545
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:47,766
Jordan Goldfarb?

546
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:48,961
Jordan...

547
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:50,525
Jordan the country.

548
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:53,161
It shares a border with Iraq.
It's a U.S. ally.

549
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:55,966
And most importantly, there's no embargo.

550
00:29:57,320 --> 00:29:59,129
Okay, so what do we tell the Italians?

551
00:29:59,320 --> 00:30:01,129
Fuck them! As far as they're concerned

552
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:04,603
they're sending 5,000 Berettas
to a country they have no issue with.

553
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:07,087
All we have to do is ship the guns

554
00:30:07,320 --> 00:30:09,004
from Jordan to Baghdad.

555
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:10,651
It's called circumvention.

556
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:13,201
Is that legal?

557
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:15,486
It's not illegal.

558
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:18,761
Want to try?

559
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:22,406
How did that charity thing go?

560
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:23,931
It was 5K, right?

561
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:25,770
It was supposed to be a 5K.

562
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:28,008
Uh, I finished about 1 K of it.

563
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:30,248
So, I should probably return
four-fifths of the money.

564
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:33,850
So, Andrew told me

565
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:36,361
you and Efraim are working together now?

566
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:37,881
Really?

567
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:39,969
Yeah, I told her about the sheet thing.

568
00:30:40,520 --> 00:30:42,648
Yeah. Efraim has some contacts
with the government.

569
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:45,889
So we're just combining forces right now.

570
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:48,401
Yeah, just... Just be careful with him.

571
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:50,568
- Emily, don't.
- What?

572
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:52,000
How do you mean?

573
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:54,891
Well, his cousin, Rebecca,
is an old friend of mine.

574
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:56,451
We went to camp together.

575
00:30:56,640 --> 00:31:00,008
And she told me
that he stole $70,000 from her father.

576
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:01,725
Whoa, really?

577
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:02,961
That's interesting.

578
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:04,730
I actually heard
it was the other way around.

579
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:07,566
That his uncle is the one
who stole the money from him.

580
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:09,040
See? You don't know.

581
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:10,571
Everyone has their own version of a story.

582
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:12,325
No, I'm pretty certain.

583
00:31:12,520 --> 00:31:14,409
Their whole family
stopped talking to him over it.

584
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:17,450
Yo! Why aren't you answering your phone?

585
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:19,291
Hey, what's up, man?

586
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:22,161
Fuck is this?

587
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:25,489
Everyone, this is David's
business partner, Efraim.

588
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:27,843
- Hey, man.
- Hey, man.

589
00:31:28,040 --> 00:31:29,690
Bro, could I talk to you
outside for a minute?

590
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:31,405
- It's urgent.
- Yeah, of course.

591
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:34,447
And for the record,
I'm also his best friend,

592
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:37,166
so probably should have been
invited to whatever this is.

593
00:31:40,760 --> 00:31:43,445
Look, these are her friends.
This is her dinner party.

594
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:45,768
Rosen is her friend now? That Jew fuck?

595
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,240
Trust me, you don't want to be here.

596
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:48,771
I don't want to be here, all right?

597
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:50,521
Now, what's going on?

598
00:31:50,760 --> 00:31:52,444
Jordanian customs seized our Berettas.

599
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:54,962
- What? Why?
- I don't fucking know, David.

600
00:31:55,160 --> 00:31:58,089
I dropped out of high school before
they covered international diplomacy.

601
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:01,761
- Who's that?
- Fuck, it's Santos.

602
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:03,007
He knows!

603
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:06,006
Pick it up, I want to listen.

604
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:08,646
- Pick... Pick up the fucking phone.
- This is David.

605
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:11,161
Yeah, I just heard my guns
are being held up in Jordan.

606
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:14,370
Captain Santos, yes,
there's been a slight hiccup.

607
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:15,891
What are they even doing in Jordan?

608
00:32:16,120 --> 00:32:17,121
Not to worry.

609
00:32:17,320 --> 00:32:19,687
They're in a hangar in Amman.
Totally safe.

610
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,571
My team and I are working
on a solution right now.

611
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:24,285
You didn't answer my question.

612
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:26,289
What the fuck are my guns doing in Jordan?

613
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:29,243
Captain Santos, this is Efraim Diveroli.

614
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:31,090
President of AEY, sir.

615
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:34,290
David has apprised me of the situation and
we are looking at options as we speak.

616
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:35,720
Options? What kind of options?

617
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:38,891
Well, are you familiar
with the Corvus TP1 9?

618
00:32:39,080 --> 00:32:41,048
That's Brazilian and it's shit.

619
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:43,481
Contract says Berettas, I want Berettas.

620
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:45,762
Sir, I need you to work
with us a little on this.

621
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:46,961
Let me get this straight.

622
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:50,491
I'm in the ass crack of the world,
defending your freedom.

623
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:52,603
And I got to work with you shit bags?

624
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:54,041
Look, I don't know

625
00:32:54,280 --> 00:32:58,171
if those Berettas are really in Amman or
if you're just trying to goose your profits

626
00:32:58,360 --> 00:33:01,569
like every other piece of shit
in your miserable, rat-fuck profession.

627
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:04,366
Either way, you're endangering my mission.

628
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:05,607
I'm shutting you down.

629
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:07,484
I'm canceling you for cause.

630
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:11,244
Getting canceled for cause
was a death sentence.

631
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:14,051
It meant we would never
win another contract.

632
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:19,770
Captain, please do not do that.

633
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:21,731
I know you're upset.

634
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:23,843
But from one Christian to another

635
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:30,129
my wife and I are having
serious financial problems.

636
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:33,370
Our son, Lucas, is in the hospital.

637
00:33:33,560 --> 00:33:35,767
Medical bills are through the roof.

638
00:33:36,280 --> 00:33:40,205
If you do this, it'll ruin me.
It'll ruin my family.

639
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:41,521
As God as my witness,

640
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:43,648
I will get you your guns.

641
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:44,841
Hello?

642
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:47,767
What a fucking piece of shit!
Do you believe this fucking guy?

643
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,240
- Fuck.
- What's going on?

644
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,729
What guns, David?

645
00:33:57,600 --> 00:33:59,443
Are you fucking kidding me?

646
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:02,200
You told me you guys
were selling bed sheets.

647
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:05,210
Yeah, and I also told you
that we're selling other stuff too.

648
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:07,164
I thought you meant pillows!

649
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:10,371
Look, I can't support a kid
by giving massages.

650
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:12,369
Okay? And nobody
was buying the bed sheets.

651
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:14,164
No, David, you lied to me.

652
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:16,448
Because I know how you feel about the war.

653
00:34:16,640 --> 00:34:18,563
I thought we both felt that way!

654
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:21,170
I'm five months pregnant!

655
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:23,249
And it's a problem
if I can't trust the man

656
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:24,521
I'm having a baby with!

657
00:34:24,720 --> 00:34:26,848
- Of course you can trust me.
- Really?

658
00:34:27,080 --> 00:34:29,805
Because five minutes ago, I didn't
even know you were an arms dealer!

659
00:34:30,080 --> 00:34:31,605
I'm not an arms dealer.

660
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:33,330
What we do is perfectly legal.

661
00:34:33,720 --> 00:34:35,768
We work for the government.
We're middlemen.

662
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:38,167
We don't touch the guns,
we don't see the guns.

663
00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:40,647
We never even leave the office.

664
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:42,444
Hey, sorry to interrupt.
It's time sensitive.

665
00:34:42,680 --> 00:34:43,806
David, do you have a passport?

666
00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:46,529
What? Yeah, why?

667
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:48,961
We have to go to Jordan. Like, ASAP.

668
00:34:49,160 --> 00:34:50,571
Straighten this shit out.

669
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:52,205
We gotta talk, whatever, okay?

670
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:53,601
Yeah.

671
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:56,041
Yo, you window or aisle?

672
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:05,043
- Excuse me, sorry.
- Yeah, we just landed.

673
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:06,850
- Excuse me.
- The Embassy call?

674
00:35:07,080 --> 00:35:09,731
Excuse me. Okay, bye.

675
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:13,050
- Sorry, kind of an emergency.
- Excuse me. Sorry.

676
00:35:13,240 --> 00:35:14,969
Don't worry, I have to go first.
I'm American.

677
00:35:15,160 --> 00:35:16,321
I'm sorry.

678
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:31,969
The American Embassy
offered little to no help

679
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:34,640
in dealing with the Ministry of Customs.

680
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:36,888
So we took matters into our own hands.

681
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:49,729
He says your permit has expired

682
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:52,406
and that you can't fly your crates
out of Jordan without one.

683
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:54,204
Yeah, we know. That's why we're here.

684
00:35:54,680 --> 00:35:58,082
Look, we were told that
you know people in the government,

685
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:01,165
that maybe you can help us out.

686
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:15,971
He says it will take six weeks
to get a new permit.

687
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:18,003
Yeah, that's the issue.
We don't have six weeks.

688
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:19,770
We need our guns today.

689
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:26,411
Look, I don't want to come off
as the ugly American here.

690
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:30,161
And maybe I don't understand
the rituals of your culture

691
00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:31,691
but this feels like the moment

692
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:33,848
where we are supposed to offer
him a gift, am I correct?

693
00:36:34,120 --> 00:36:35,770
- You are correct.
- All right.

694
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:41,362
$1,400 U.S. Cool?

695
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:43,361
Cool, man.

696
00:36:44,680 --> 00:36:47,684
Could have just started with that,
you know, saved all this bullshit.

697
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:48,881
I like your shades.

698
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:50,770
Tell him I'll give him
100 bucks for those shades.

699
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:52,166
Tell him in gibberish.

700
00:36:56,240 --> 00:36:57,969
No way. Alligator.

701
00:36:58,160 --> 00:37:00,049
Yeah, I know. I...

702
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:02,806
It's Lacoste. It's actually a crocodile.

703
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:05,964
I like fancy shit, that's my thing.

704
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:07,611
Tell him.

705
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:13,084
For three days, we didn't hear anything.

706
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:15,245
It was ridiculous.

707
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:19,525
Our entire business was riding on the word
of an 11-year-old translator.

708
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:23,443
Motherfucker! He ripped us off!

709
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:25,811
We don't know that yet.

710
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,207
No! I know what it feels like
to fuck somebody.

711
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:30,641
I also know what it feels like
to get fucked by somebody.

712
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:32,251
And we just got fucked.

713
00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:34,887
You need to chill out.

714
00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:36,724
How am I supposed to chill out, David?

715
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:39,241
We're in a Muslim country,
I can't even get a blowjob!

716
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:41,005
It's embarrassing!

717
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:44,161
It's chaos here! Fuck!

718
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:54,201
Yeah.

719
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:56,001
Right now?

720
00:37:57,160 --> 00:37:58,525
We're coming down.

721
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:00,290
That was Aladdin. They're in the lobby.

722
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:02,721
See that? Come on.

723
00:38:04,680 --> 00:38:07,081
Hold on. Are you fucking kidding me?

724
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:08,321
What's the problem?

725
00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:11,888
You wanted your guns back,
he got you your guns back.

726
00:38:12,080 --> 00:38:15,402
What? No, we said we needed a permit
to fly them to Iraq.

727
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:19,082
Exactly, but you don't need
a permit to drive them.

728
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:21,604
You expect us to drive them to Iraq?

729
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:26,085
Why not? Marlboro is the best
smuggler in all of Jordan.

730
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:27,561
Who, this?

731
00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:30,406
This is the best smuggler
in all of Jordan?

732
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:34,725
Yeah, he drives to Baghdad
three, four times a month.

733
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:38,206
Efraim, you want to weigh in here?

734
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:40,408
Yo, how far is it to Baghdad?

735
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:43,451
- Why are you asking him that?
- 800 kilometers.

736
00:38:43,720 --> 00:38:44,846
And he knows what he's doing?

737
00:38:45,160 --> 00:38:46,446
Efraim, stop.

738
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:48,608
- 100% the best.
- Come on.

739
00:38:48,840 --> 00:38:51,684
It's like 500 miles.
We'll be there by morning.

740
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:55,360
You seriously want to drive to Baghdad?

741
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:58,331
David, we're gunrunners.

742
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:01,325
Let's go run some fucking guns.

743
00:39:01,880 --> 00:39:02,961
Let's go.

744
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:05,765
Come on.

745
00:39:11,720 --> 00:39:15,361
Hey, seriously, is this safe?
Driving to Baghdad?

746
00:39:15,560 --> 00:39:17,528
Yes, very safe.

747
00:39:17,720 --> 00:39:18,767
50-50.

748
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:24,561
50-50? What, like 50% we live, 50% we die?

749
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:27,604
Yes. That is why we drive through night.

750
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:29,845
It is much safer.

751
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:32,245
How much safer?

752
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:33,720
50-50.

753
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:35,331
Bro, what the fuck!

754
00:39:35,560 --> 00:39:38,484
Obviously, he doesn't know
what 50-50 means.

755
00:39:39,080 --> 00:39:40,081
Oh, my God.

756
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:43,130
Hey, what about gas though?
It's a long trip, no?

757
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:46,490
No problem. Petrol free in Iraq.

758
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:48,166
No kidding.

759
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:49,925
- Free gas?
- Yeah.

760
00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:53,244
See what I'm talking about? Iraq is dope.

761
00:39:55,080 --> 00:39:57,128
I'm thinking about getting a place there.

762
00:39:58,840 --> 00:40:00,080
Free gas.

763
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:02,369
Fucking cool, man.

764
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:27,001
What is that?

765
00:40:29,320 --> 00:40:30,321
What?

766
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:32,405
You don't see that?

767
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:35,925
What the fuck?

768
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:37,765
Hey, why are you slowing down, man?

769
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:39,321
It's okay, it's okay.

770
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:42,208
What's okay?

771
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:44,004
Whoa, whoa. What the fuck, bro?

772
00:40:44,200 --> 00:40:45,486
It's okay. Border.

773
00:40:47,080 --> 00:40:48,081
What, this?

774
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:51,206
Fuck.

775
00:40:58,480 --> 00:40:59,641
- Jesus.
- Put down.

776
00:40:59,840 --> 00:41:01,001
- Huh?
- Put down.

777
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:16,487
Whoa, whoa.

778
00:41:22,520 --> 00:41:23,521
Cigarettes.

779
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:27,685
For you.

780
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:29,401
Welcome.

781
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:08,283
It was fucking surreal.

782
00:42:09,160 --> 00:42:13,165
Six months ago,
I was a massage therapist in Miami Beach.

783
00:42:13,360 --> 00:42:16,330
And now, here I was,
driving a truckload of guns

784
00:42:16,520 --> 00:42:17,726
through the Iraqi desert

785
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:20,207
with my best friend from junior high.

786
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:38,209
Marlboro?

787
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:48,411
Hey, Marlboro?

788
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:14,441
Bro!

789
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:17,445
There's a dead body in the gas station!

790
00:44:17,640 --> 00:44:18,766
What the fuck!

791
00:44:20,520 --> 00:44:22,488
Where are we? Where's Marlboro?

792
00:44:22,760 --> 00:44:23,807
Did you not hear what I just said?

793
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:25,206
There's a fucking dead body in there, man!

794
00:44:25,400 --> 00:44:26,811
Yes, I heard you.

795
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:28,411
All right, we're in a war zone, bro.

796
00:44:28,640 --> 00:44:30,244
There's dead bodies, relax.

797
00:44:33,760 --> 00:44:35,444
All right, I gotta take a leak.

798
00:44:36,040 --> 00:44:37,041
What?

799
00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:44,441
Be careful.

800
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:47,120
I'm good, bro.
I know how to take a piss, all right?

801
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:55,401
Shit.

802
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:17,881
Fuck.

803
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:32,048
- Hello?
- Hey.

804
00:45:32,840 --> 00:45:34,444
Hey, babe, is everything okay?

805
00:45:34,640 --> 00:45:35,641
Yeah.

806
00:45:36,080 --> 00:45:37,445
What time is it there?

807
00:45:37,760 --> 00:45:40,001
It's, uh, 7:30 in the morning.

808
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:42,684
Shit, did I wake you?

809
00:45:42,920 --> 00:45:46,003
No, I'm just at the hotel.
We're about to have some breakfast.

810
00:45:46,280 --> 00:45:48,567
Listen, I'm not saying I like it,

811
00:45:48,800 --> 00:45:51,485
but I get why you're doing this.

812
00:45:53,160 --> 00:45:54,207
You do?

813
00:45:54,560 --> 00:45:57,325
This whole time I never thought
about what you must be going through.

814
00:45:57,560 --> 00:45:59,369
All the pressure you're under.

815
00:46:00,520 --> 00:46:03,444
It's just the lying that kills me.

816
00:46:04,520 --> 00:46:06,443
It makes me feel like I'm in this alone.

817
00:46:09,120 --> 00:46:11,566
No, you're not in this alone.

818
00:46:13,680 --> 00:46:16,684
I need you to know
that you can tell me anything, David.

819
00:46:16,880 --> 00:46:18,723
We're partners, remember?

820
00:46:22,720 --> 00:46:23,721
David?

821
00:46:24,080 --> 00:46:25,525
Yeah, I gotta call you right back.

822
00:46:25,760 --> 00:46:27,250
- Is everything okay?
- Yeah, everything's fine.

823
00:46:27,440 --> 00:46:28,441
I'm just going to call you
right back, okay?

824
00:46:28,680 --> 00:46:29,681
I love you. Bye.

825
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:31,843
Efraim!

826
00:46:32,480 --> 00:46:33,481
Efraim!

827
00:46:33,760 --> 00:46:35,410
- What?
- Look!

828
00:46:38,760 --> 00:46:40,888
Marlboro!

829
00:46:45,520 --> 00:46:48,251
Fuck! What the fuck, bro.

830
00:46:48,440 --> 00:46:49,726
Holy shit, they have guns, man!

831
00:46:49,920 --> 00:46:51,160
I know!

832
00:46:51,360 --> 00:46:52,486
Go, go! Come on.

833
00:46:52,680 --> 00:46:54,648
What the fuck! It won't start!

834
00:46:54,840 --> 00:46:56,171
Where the fuck is Marlboro?

835
00:46:56,360 --> 00:46:58,442
- I got it!
- Go! Go!

836
00:47:09,080 --> 00:47:10,241
No, no, no!

837
00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:12,770
Wait, wait, wait!

838
00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:18,883
Wait! No!

839
00:47:21,120 --> 00:47:22,610
Run, motherfucker! Jump in!

840
00:47:27,560 --> 00:47:30,245
Holy shit! They're getting
closer. Come on, man. Go!

841
00:47:30,440 --> 00:47:31,885
Go, go!

842
00:47:32,080 --> 00:47:33,127
Come on!

843
00:47:42,320 --> 00:47:43,367
Are you kidding me?

844
00:47:43,560 --> 00:47:45,608
We stopped for gas in Fallujah?

845
00:47:45,880 --> 00:47:47,041
You cheap fuck!

846
00:47:48,640 --> 00:47:49,926
Go!

847
00:47:50,120 --> 00:47:51,610
Fuck you, Marlboro!

848
00:47:52,480 --> 00:47:53,481
Fuck.

849
00:47:57,080 --> 00:47:58,525
Fuck. Fuck.

850
00:47:58,720 --> 00:48:00,370
We're gonna die!

851
00:48:00,600 --> 00:48:02,728
You wanted to drive
to Baghdad, you asshole!

852
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:07,847
They're stopping.

853
00:48:08,040 --> 00:48:10,247
What the fuck? Look.

854
00:48:11,400 --> 00:48:13,050
Holy fuck, bro.

855
00:48:16,840 --> 00:48:19,650
Oh, fuck! All right!

856
00:48:21,880 --> 00:48:24,611
God bless Dick Cheney's America!

857
00:49:00,800 --> 00:49:03,326
Look at this fucking place. Oh, my God.

858
00:49:13,520 --> 00:49:14,726
Excuse me, sir?

859
00:49:16,920 --> 00:49:17,921
What?

860
00:49:18,200 --> 00:49:19,645
There are some guys here to see you.

861
00:49:19,840 --> 00:49:21,046
Some guys?

862
00:49:24,440 --> 00:49:25,805
What kind of guys?

863
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:27,365
Hey, Marlboro!

864
00:49:27,680 --> 00:49:29,603
Give us a smile, gorgeous.

865
00:49:30,360 --> 00:49:32,840
Let me see those pearly yellows.

866
00:49:33,320 --> 00:49:35,766
You're like an Iraqi Tom Selleck, bro.

867
00:49:37,880 --> 00:49:39,370
You guys are AEY?

868
00:49:39,920 --> 00:49:41,684
Yes, sir. David Packouz.

869
00:49:41,880 --> 00:49:44,008
This is my colleague, Efraim Diveroli.

870
00:49:44,800 --> 00:49:46,131
We spoke on the phone.

871
00:49:46,480 --> 00:49:47,766
I remember.

872
00:49:52,760 --> 00:49:54,171
You drove these?

873
00:49:54,960 --> 00:49:56,962
Through the Triangle of Death?

874
00:50:01,680 --> 00:50:03,569
Fucking A right we did.

875
00:50:04,840 --> 00:50:07,969
Kip, take these boys over to the cage,
get them paid.

876
00:50:08,160 --> 00:50:09,161
Right away, sir.

877
00:50:09,400 --> 00:50:11,084
I was wrong about you two.

878
00:50:13,320 --> 00:50:15,163
Great fucking job, boys.

879
00:50:15,960 --> 00:50:17,371
Great fucking job.

880
00:50:20,800 --> 00:50:23,804
Holy shit, the Triangle of Death, bro?

881
00:50:25,760 --> 00:50:29,082
That's right.
That's the AEY guarantee, bitch.

882
00:50:29,280 --> 00:50:32,602
We drive through all triangles,
including your mom's.

883
00:50:33,600 --> 00:50:35,728
Hey, Kip, snap a photo of us, pal.

884
00:50:35,920 --> 00:50:36,921
All right.

885
00:50:40,720 --> 00:50:41,721
Ready?

886
00:50:42,680 --> 00:50:45,081
- How's my hair?
- It's good, slicked back.

887
00:50:45,280 --> 00:50:46,770
Thank you.

888
00:50:46,960 --> 00:50:48,121
- Got you.
- Let me see it.

889
00:50:49,160 --> 00:50:50,161
Helmut fucking Newton over here.

890
00:50:50,400 --> 00:50:51,481
All right, man.

891
00:50:52,280 --> 00:50:53,770
- Perfect.
- All right, all right.

892
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:55,525
Let's go get fucking paid.

893
00:51:01,520 --> 00:51:02,806
Holy shit.

894
00:51:03,880 --> 00:51:07,362
Crazy, right? $12.2 billion.

895
00:51:07,680 --> 00:51:10,524
It's all seized
from the godfather himself.

896
00:51:10,720 --> 00:51:13,041
You guys call
Saddam Hussein the godfather?

897
00:51:13,320 --> 00:51:17,120
Look at all this cash, bro.
What would you call him?

898
00:51:17,320 --> 00:51:18,845
$2.8 million.

899
00:51:19,520 --> 00:51:21,887
- Just sign here.
- You got it.

900
00:51:27,240 --> 00:51:29,288
We got a military escort to the airport

901
00:51:29,520 --> 00:51:32,046
and got the fuck out of Baghdad.

902
00:51:36,880 --> 00:51:39,326
There was almost $3 million in cash

903
00:51:39,520 --> 00:51:41,761
stuffed into our Army-issued duffel bags.

904
00:51:46,320 --> 00:51:48,448
You might think
after barely surviving Iraq

905
00:51:48,640 --> 00:51:49,846
that we'd be done.

906
00:51:50,680 --> 00:51:51,841
But you'd be wrong.

907
00:51:55,960 --> 00:51:58,042
You see, the Beretta deal
put us on the map.

908
00:51:58,240 --> 00:52:01,289
After that, we started killing it.

909
00:52:06,800 --> 00:52:08,290
We bought matching Porsches.

910
00:52:08,640 --> 00:52:11,041
We bought two apartments
in the same building.

911
00:52:13,480 --> 00:52:14,891
Oh, my God.

912
00:52:20,400 --> 00:52:23,051
Holy shit, bro.

913
00:52:26,120 --> 00:52:27,246
Oh!

914
00:52:28,120 --> 00:52:29,121
Whoo!

915
00:52:32,040 --> 00:52:33,804
Ralph was so happy with his returns

916
00:52:34,040 --> 00:52:35,929
that he increased his original investment

917
00:52:36,120 --> 00:52:38,043
in AEY by $10 million.

918
00:52:43,520 --> 00:52:46,091
That gave us enough capital
to pursue more deals

919
00:52:46,280 --> 00:52:47,645
and expand the company.

920
00:52:48,120 --> 00:52:50,088
Which is exactly what we did.

921
00:52:56,760 --> 00:52:59,286
I cannot stress this enough.

922
00:52:59,960 --> 00:53:02,804
You need to be scouring this website.

923
00:53:03,080 --> 00:53:04,286
Day and night.

924
00:53:04,920 --> 00:53:07,491
It is updated by the minute.

925
00:53:07,840 --> 00:53:12,482
There are tens of thousands of
solicitations on this website.

926
00:53:12,960 --> 00:53:16,043
Each one is 40 to 50 pages long.

927
00:53:16,520 --> 00:53:18,921
If you see something interesting,

928
00:53:19,480 --> 00:53:21,130
you bring it to me.

929
00:53:21,760 --> 00:53:23,808
If you bring it to me,

930
00:53:25,520 --> 00:53:27,090
I'll make you rich.

931
00:53:28,440 --> 00:53:29,851
Fact, 18 months ago,

932
00:53:30,040 --> 00:53:31,963
David here was jerking off guys for money.

933
00:53:32,120 --> 00:53:34,521
Actually, that is not a fact.

934
00:53:34,760 --> 00:53:36,205
That is absolutely a fact.

935
00:53:36,760 --> 00:53:38,524
Now he drives a Porsche.

936
00:53:39,320 --> 00:53:41,084
And that's all because of AEY.

937
00:53:43,240 --> 00:53:44,401
Do you have any questions?

938
00:53:45,280 --> 00:53:47,203
Um, I have a question.

939
00:53:48,280 --> 00:53:50,248
What does AEY stand for?

940
00:53:50,800 --> 00:53:52,131
What do you mean? Like morally?

941
00:53:52,320 --> 00:53:55,244
No, I mean what do the letters mean?

942
00:53:55,560 --> 00:53:57,324
That's fucking...

943
00:53:57,520 --> 00:53:59,568
What does IBM stand for? Nothing.

944
00:53:59,760 --> 00:54:01,808
It just... It just sounds professional.

945
00:54:03,520 --> 00:54:08,686
Uh, actually, IBM stands for
International Business Machines.

946
00:54:11,960 --> 00:54:13,086
What did you say?

947
00:54:13,280 --> 00:54:16,648
IBM stands for
International Business Machines.

948
00:54:18,280 --> 00:54:19,611
Get the fuck out of here.

949
00:54:21,760 --> 00:54:23,683
I'm serious.
You're not going to work here.

950
00:54:24,760 --> 00:54:27,411
Get the fuck out of my office,
you fucking nerd!

951
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:30,001
Go!

952
00:54:30,800 --> 00:54:33,610
And for the record,
AEY doesn't stand for anything.

953
00:54:35,320 --> 00:54:37,448
Fuck! What a dick.

954
00:54:45,080 --> 00:54:47,606
Does anybody else have any questions?

955
00:54:55,800 --> 00:54:57,529
Sleep. I got her.

956
00:55:11,720 --> 00:55:14,166
All right. All right.

957
00:55:16,520 --> 00:55:17,521
Hi.

958
00:55:20,720 --> 00:55:22,404
I know.

959
00:55:23,240 --> 00:55:25,561
I know. It's okay.

960
00:55:29,200 --> 00:55:30,201
Okay.

961
00:55:43,080 --> 00:55:44,366
What?

962
00:55:53,680 --> 00:55:57,605
360,000 SVD sniper rifles.

963
00:55:57,760 --> 00:56:01,287
1,084,000 GP-30 grenades.

964
00:56:01,600 --> 00:56:05,002
45,000 SKO aviation rockets.

965
00:56:05,880 --> 00:56:09,726
The Pentagon's arming the Afghans
for the next 30 years.

966
00:56:09,920 --> 00:56:11,843
They're building a whole army.

967
00:56:12,560 --> 00:56:14,289
Wait, that's got to be a typo.

968
00:56:14,520 --> 00:56:15,806
It's not.

969
00:56:17,280 --> 00:56:20,284
100 million rounds of AK-47 ammo?

970
00:56:21,640 --> 00:56:23,642
Bro, these aren't crumbs.

971
00:56:24,760 --> 00:56:27,127
This is the whole fucking pie.

972
00:56:35,720 --> 00:56:37,210
Among defense contractors,

973
00:56:37,400 --> 00:56:40,051
this would come to be known
as the Afghan deal.

974
00:56:40,240 --> 00:56:42,083
It would be the biggest opportunity

975
00:56:42,280 --> 00:56:44,044
AEY would ever see.

976
00:56:46,520 --> 00:56:48,249
We had to go for it.

977
00:56:51,120 --> 00:56:54,090
So, where do you go
to arm an entire country?

978
00:57:00,320 --> 00:57:02,891
Vegas X is where
military and manufacturers

979
00:57:03,120 --> 00:57:06,124
come together to unveil
the latest in warfare.

980
00:57:06,360 --> 00:57:09,842
It's like Comic-Con with grenades.

981
00:57:12,840 --> 00:57:16,640
Sure, most of these guys
didn't know who AEY was.

982
00:57:17,400 --> 00:57:19,801
But we saw that as an advantage.

983
00:57:21,200 --> 00:57:22,690
- You got your list?
- Got it.

984
00:57:22,840 --> 00:57:24,842
- You feel good?
- Yeah, I feel pretty good.

985
00:57:25,080 --> 00:57:27,162
You know, this is different
than doing business on the phone.

986
00:57:27,360 --> 00:57:29,044
When they look at us,
they're going to see two kids.

987
00:57:29,240 --> 00:57:30,366
So we have to show them our balls.

988
00:57:30,520 --> 00:57:31,521
Got it.

989
00:57:31,760 --> 00:57:33,489
We need to be fucking thugs,
you understand?

990
00:57:33,720 --> 00:57:34,721
Understood.

991
00:57:34,880 --> 00:57:36,962
All right, good. Let's kill this shit.

992
00:57:42,360 --> 00:57:44,328
But it was a complete disaster.

993
00:57:46,880 --> 00:57:48,006
We quickly learned that

994
00:57:48,200 --> 00:57:50,043
even if we could land the Afghan deal,

995
00:57:50,200 --> 00:57:52,567
it would be a logistical nightmare.

996
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:54,240
Jerry, good to see you.

997
00:57:54,760 --> 00:57:56,364
To source a deal of this magnitude

998
00:57:56,560 --> 00:57:57,846
would mean piecing together

999
00:57:58,040 --> 00:58:00,884
multiple vendors
from all around the world.

1000
00:58:01,080 --> 00:58:02,445
Whoa, whoa.

1001
00:58:02,720 --> 00:58:03,721
Get out of here.

1002
00:58:03,920 --> 00:58:05,684
It would require dozens of shipping outfits

1003
00:58:05,880 --> 00:58:07,245
and hundreds of permits.

1004
00:58:07,440 --> 00:58:08,930
We need 100 million rounds.

1005
00:58:09,120 --> 00:58:12,727
All that could be okay
for a major defense contractor.

1006
00:58:12,920 --> 00:58:14,251
But not for us.

1007
00:58:16,520 --> 00:58:19,967
Honestly, we were out of our league.

1008
00:58:44,640 --> 00:58:46,642
Change $10,000.

1009
00:58:49,240 --> 00:58:50,605
Any luck today?

1010
00:59:05,640 --> 00:59:06,766
Efraim!

1011
00:59:10,800 --> 00:59:11,801
What's up, bro?

1012
00:59:11,960 --> 00:59:13,325
Where you been? Why aren't you
answering your phone?

1013
00:59:13,560 --> 00:59:14,766
I'm with a prostitute. What's up?

1014
00:59:14,960 --> 00:59:17,122
Okay, you need to get dressed
and come with me right now.

1015
00:59:17,360 --> 00:59:19,283
All right, uh, give me

1016
00:59:20,560 --> 00:59:21,607
38 minutes.

1017
00:59:21,800 --> 00:59:25,122
Efraim, Henry Girard is down at the bar,
waiting for us.

1018
00:59:25,760 --> 00:59:26,841
Get the fuck out of here.

1019
00:59:27,280 --> 00:59:28,361
I'm dead serious.

1020
00:59:30,760 --> 00:59:31,807
Shit.

1021
00:59:33,040 --> 00:59:34,201
Okay.

1022
00:59:35,200 --> 00:59:38,010
Henry Girard was a legend
among arms dealers.

1023
00:59:38,520 --> 00:59:41,683
When they hung Saddam Hussein
for crimes against humanity

1024
00:59:41,840 --> 00:59:44,366
it was said that Henry sold them the rope.

1025
00:59:44,640 --> 00:59:45,641
Hey, Henry, sorry I'm late.

1026
00:59:45,840 --> 00:59:47,171
This is my partner
I was telling you about.

1027
00:59:47,360 --> 00:59:49,328
- Efraim Diveroli.
- Nice to meet you.

1028
00:59:49,560 --> 00:59:51,164
It's an absolute pleasure.

1029
00:59:51,400 --> 00:59:52,686
Henry has a dinner in 10 minutes,

1030
00:59:52,840 --> 00:59:54,365
but I wanted you to hear this firsthand.

1031
00:59:54,840 --> 00:59:56,968
I showed him the list and he can help.

1032
00:59:57,680 --> 00:59:59,409
Great. With which part?

1033
00:59:59,680 --> 01:00:00,681
All of it.

1034
01:00:01,240 --> 01:00:02,571
He can fill the whole order.

1035
01:00:03,320 --> 01:00:05,004
- The whole order?
- Mmm-hmm.

1036
01:00:05,200 --> 01:00:06,645
Even the AK ammo?

1037
01:00:07,040 --> 01:00:08,530
Not a problem.

1038
01:00:09,040 --> 01:00:11,566
You do know it's
100 million rounds, right?

1039
01:00:11,800 --> 01:00:13,689
Henry has contacts in Albania.

1040
01:00:14,320 --> 01:00:15,367
Albania?

1041
01:00:15,880 --> 01:00:18,360
They spent decades preparing
for a Western invasion that never came.

1042
01:00:18,560 --> 01:00:20,369
That country is one giant arsenal.

1043
01:00:20,560 --> 01:00:22,528
It's all just sitting there.

1044
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:24,001
Tell him the best part.

1045
01:00:24,200 --> 01:00:26,202
They're in the process of joining NATO,

1046
01:00:26,400 --> 01:00:29,609
so they have to dispose of all
of their Soviet era weapons.

1047
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:33,049
They are literally dismantling it
and turning it into scrap.

1048
01:00:33,440 --> 01:00:35,568
I can get most of the shit
for pennies on the dollar.

1049
01:00:36,080 --> 01:00:37,570
Now, tell him the other best part.

1050
01:00:39,880 --> 01:00:43,043
You're looking at the exclusive agent
for the whole fucking thing.

1051
01:00:43,560 --> 01:00:45,130
This was the magic bullet.

1052
01:00:45,720 --> 01:00:49,247
One supplier who could
fill the entire Afghan deal.

1053
01:00:50,440 --> 01:00:52,727
This wouldn't just put us in contention.

1054
01:00:52,880 --> 01:00:55,087
We might actually win this thing.

1055
01:00:57,880 --> 01:00:59,041
Sorry, I have a question.

1056
01:00:59,400 --> 01:01:00,401
Sure.

1057
01:01:00,600 --> 01:01:02,204
With that kind of hookup

1058
01:01:02,400 --> 01:01:04,289
why don't you just bid
on the contract yourself?

1059
01:01:07,920 --> 01:01:08,921
Full disclosure?

1060
01:01:12,760 --> 01:01:14,762
I'm barred from doing any business
with the U.S. government.

1061
01:01:14,960 --> 01:01:16,086
I'm on a watch list.

1062
01:01:17,200 --> 01:01:18,486
Like a terrorist watch list?

1063
01:01:18,760 --> 01:01:19,807
Mmm-hmm.

1064
01:01:20,320 --> 01:01:22,402
- Got it.
- Wait, what?

1065
01:01:22,600 --> 01:01:24,090
Okay, how much for the AK ammo?

1066
01:01:24,320 --> 01:01:26,482
- 10 cents a round.
- That's fucking amazing.

1067
01:01:26,720 --> 01:01:27,721
And what about shipping?

1068
01:01:27,960 --> 01:01:29,450
You can get Ilyushin 76
through Russian pilots.

1069
01:01:29,680 --> 01:01:30,681
80K per flight.

1070
01:01:30,880 --> 01:01:32,769
I'm sorry, you're on
a terrorist watch list?

1071
01:01:33,080 --> 01:01:34,081
What the fuck!

1072
01:01:34,280 --> 01:01:36,282
Do you work for Homeland Security?
Relax, bro.

1073
01:01:36,720 --> 01:01:38,404
You two should probably talk this over.

1074
01:01:38,600 --> 01:01:41,126
We will. But we are very interested.

1075
01:01:41,280 --> 01:01:43,601
Good. My flight leaves
tomorrow morning at 10:00.

1076
01:01:43,800 --> 01:01:45,802
I can't spend more than 48 hours
in this dump.

1077
01:01:46,440 --> 01:01:48,920
That's what I always say.
Vegas is a two-day town.

1078
01:01:50,640 --> 01:01:52,290
I was talking about America.

1079
01:01:57,800 --> 01:02:00,963
We're talking exclusive access
to a stockpile

1080
01:02:01,160 --> 01:02:03,527
of Soviet Bloc non-standard
weapons and ammo.

1081
01:02:03,760 --> 01:02:05,364
That's going to win this deal for us.

1082
01:02:05,600 --> 01:02:06,965
He's on a terrorist watch list!

1083
01:02:07,160 --> 01:02:10,448
Whatever. People end up on that list
for bringing scissors onto an airplane!

1084
01:02:10,920 --> 01:02:12,206
That's not why he's on the list.

1085
01:02:13,040 --> 01:02:17,523
Look, the Pentagon wants
100 million rounds of AK-47 ammo

1086
01:02:17,760 --> 01:02:20,161
in the middle of a worldwide shortage.

1087
01:02:20,320 --> 01:02:22,527
Where do you think
they think that's going to come from?

1088
01:02:23,200 --> 01:02:25,885
A bunch of shady motherfuckers
like that guy.

1089
01:02:27,440 --> 01:02:29,488
This is the job.

1090
01:02:29,680 --> 01:02:31,489
To do business with the people in places

1091
01:02:31,720 --> 01:02:34,690
the U.S. government
can't do business with directly.

1092
01:02:35,360 --> 01:02:37,010
It's as simple as that.

1093
01:02:38,520 --> 01:02:39,646
Fuck!

1094
01:03:00,320 --> 01:03:01,321
Hey, boys.

1095
01:03:01,520 --> 01:03:04,171
So we discussed it,
and we'd like to move forward.

1096
01:03:04,640 --> 01:03:06,404
Fantastic. Congratulations.

1097
01:03:06,640 --> 01:03:08,722
- But we have to see the merchandise.
- Oh, of course.

1098
01:03:08,880 --> 01:03:10,530
On site, in person.

1099
01:03:11,480 --> 01:03:13,164
You guys ever been to Albania?

1100
01:03:13,480 --> 01:03:14,891
Honestly, until last night

1101
01:03:15,160 --> 01:03:16,764
I didn't even know it was
a real fucking country.

1102
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:18,570
Oh, it's a beautiful place.

1103
01:03:18,720 --> 01:03:21,724
Come on in. I'll call my guy
and we'll set it up.

1104
01:03:25,560 --> 01:03:27,608
Albania is a lot of things.

1105
01:03:27,840 --> 01:03:30,002
But a beautiful place is not one of them.

1106
01:03:31,040 --> 01:03:32,565
It took us three separate flights

1107
01:03:32,760 --> 01:03:35,081
and 22 hours just to get there.

1108
01:03:36,240 --> 01:03:37,571
Henry's people sent a driver

1109
01:03:37,760 --> 01:03:39,250
to pick us up at the airport

1110
01:03:39,440 --> 01:03:42,091
and the guy would not stop talking.

1111
01:03:42,360 --> 01:03:44,044
I fall over, she revive me.

1112
01:03:45,720 --> 01:03:48,530
But none of that diminished
Efraim's enthusiasm.

1113
01:03:48,760 --> 01:03:50,922
He really believed
this could be the answer.

1114
01:04:21,160 --> 01:04:22,605
Welcome, AEY.

1115
01:04:23,440 --> 01:04:24,441
I am Yili Pinari,

1116
01:04:24,640 --> 01:04:26,961
head of Albania's largest
military export company.

1117
01:04:27,160 --> 01:04:29,447
Efraim Diveroli. Good to see you.

1118
01:04:31,560 --> 01:04:34,131
This is my business associate,
David Packouz.

1119
01:04:34,280 --> 01:04:35,964
- Glad to meet you.
- How you doing?

1120
01:04:36,600 --> 01:04:37,647
Uh...

1121
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:39,286
Thank you for the sign.

1122
01:04:39,600 --> 01:04:41,284
Oh. It's for you.

1123
01:04:41,520 --> 01:04:44,330
Yes, I know.
I said thank you for the sign.

1124
01:04:46,120 --> 01:04:48,771
So, show us what you got.

1125
01:04:54,960 --> 01:04:56,485
What is this place?

1126
01:04:56,640 --> 01:04:58,642
Storage for the Albanian army.

1127
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:03,129
We have 700 more like it
across the country.

1128
01:05:03,320 --> 01:05:05,322
You have 700 warehouses like this?

1129
01:05:05,520 --> 01:05:06,885
Not just warehouse.

1130
01:05:07,120 --> 01:05:10,010
We use church, hospital, school.

1131
01:05:10,160 --> 01:05:12,322
Albania is most armed country
in the world.

1132
01:05:12,520 --> 01:05:14,284
Hey, that's cool. Congrats, bro.

1133
01:05:14,480 --> 01:05:16,369
It was like a fucking museum in there.

1134
01:05:16,640 --> 01:05:18,165
Most of this shit hadn't seen daylight

1135
01:05:18,360 --> 01:05:19,964
since the Cold War.

1136
01:05:20,160 --> 01:05:21,810
But that didn't matter to us.

1137
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:24,207
All we cared about was the AK ammo.

1138
01:05:24,480 --> 01:05:28,405
It's okay. We have plenty
of what you came for.

1139
01:05:30,520 --> 01:05:35,526
All these containers
are filled with your bullets.

1140
01:05:37,280 --> 01:05:39,009
What do you mean,
all the bullets are right here?

1141
01:05:40,840 --> 01:05:43,491
126 million rounds.

1142
01:05:46,600 --> 01:05:47,647
Fuck me.

1143
01:05:47,920 --> 01:05:50,526
Yeah. Fuck us all.

1144
01:06:07,400 --> 01:06:08,401
How old are these?

1145
01:06:08,560 --> 01:06:12,724
30, maybe 40 years. AK-47 bullets

1146
01:06:12,880 --> 01:06:15,042
can last forever if properly stored.

1147
01:06:15,400 --> 01:06:17,050
Right. Well, how were these stored?

1148
01:06:17,280 --> 01:06:18,611
Uh, who gives a fuck
how these were stored?

1149
01:06:18,840 --> 01:06:20,080
All that matters is they fucking work.

1150
01:06:20,280 --> 01:06:21,566
Do they work?

1151
01:06:25,080 --> 01:06:26,206
You try.

1152
01:06:35,760 --> 01:06:37,603
They fucking worked.

1153
01:06:39,280 --> 01:06:42,363
The entire defense industry
was scrambling over this deal.

1154
01:06:42,600 --> 01:06:45,604
And the key to it was sitting
in 23 shipping containers

1155
01:06:45,800 --> 01:06:50,124
in the back of a rusted out warehouse
on the other side of the world.

1156
01:07:05,120 --> 01:07:06,770
We got back with just enough time

1157
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:09,606
to submit our bid
before the government's deadline.

1158
01:07:13,160 --> 01:07:14,400
And then we waited.

1159
01:07:16,280 --> 01:07:18,442
We waited five months.

1160
01:07:19,960 --> 01:07:21,166
Pa.

1161
01:07:22,800 --> 01:07:24,131
David!

1162
01:07:25,080 --> 01:07:27,287
- Is that Efraim?
- What?

1163
01:07:29,120 --> 01:07:31,487
- Is it?
- David!

1164
01:07:31,840 --> 01:07:33,080
We fucking won!

1165
01:07:34,320 --> 01:07:36,766
Holy shit. We won the Afghan deal.

1166
01:07:36,960 --> 01:07:38,485
- What?
- We won the Afghan deal!

1167
01:07:38,640 --> 01:07:39,926
- We won?
- We fucking won!

1168
01:07:40,160 --> 01:07:41,764
Bro! Are you fucking kidding me?

1169
01:07:41,960 --> 01:07:43,962
- We fucking won!
- Yeah, motherfucker!

1170
01:07:46,040 --> 01:07:48,281
Yeah! Yeah, motherfucker!

1171
01:07:55,280 --> 01:07:56,486
Before we could begin,

1172
01:07:56,640 --> 01:07:59,883
AEY still needed to be vetted
by the government.

1173
01:08:00,120 --> 01:08:01,485
It's a pain-in-the ass process

1174
01:08:01,720 --> 01:08:03,165
involving three separate audits

1175
01:08:03,320 --> 01:08:05,971
and an in-person interview.

1176
01:08:06,320 --> 01:08:08,687
The audits were the biggest hurdle.

1177
01:08:08,960 --> 01:08:11,531
I mean, we didn't even
have a real bookkeeper.

1178
01:08:11,720 --> 01:08:13,722
We didn't have real books.

1179
01:08:14,400 --> 01:08:16,368
We had to fabricate AEY's accounting

1180
01:08:16,520 --> 01:08:18,409
going back three years.

1181
01:08:18,640 --> 01:08:22,565
Ledgers, bank statements,
phony purchase orders,

1182
01:08:22,800 --> 01:08:24,643
we forged it all.

1183
01:08:27,400 --> 01:08:29,084
Two weeks later, we were in Rock Island,

1184
01:08:29,320 --> 01:08:30,651
Illinois for our big meeting

1185
01:08:30,840 --> 01:08:33,730
with procurement officers
from the U.S. Military.

1186
01:08:37,640 --> 01:08:39,244
We were pretty fucking nervous.

1187
01:08:39,480 --> 01:08:43,087
So Efraim thought it'd be a good idea
to get high in the parking lot.

1188
01:08:52,560 --> 01:08:53,891
Hold up.

1189
01:08:56,040 --> 01:08:58,771
Does it sound like
we're more than two people right now?

1190
01:09:00,400 --> 01:09:01,401
Yeah.

1191
01:09:01,720 --> 01:09:04,246
It was really strong shit.

1192
01:09:04,400 --> 01:09:05,526
Okay.

1193
01:09:19,800 --> 01:09:21,245
This is very impressive.

1194
01:09:21,920 --> 01:09:23,922
Very impressive.

1195
01:09:24,560 --> 01:09:26,881
Frankly, we were a tad concerned
with your performance history

1196
01:09:27,080 --> 01:09:28,809
against a deal of this size.

1197
01:09:29,040 --> 01:09:30,769
But after meeting you two face to face,

1198
01:09:30,960 --> 01:09:33,930
we feel like we're in good hands
on this one.

1199
01:09:34,120 --> 01:09:36,487
Well, we won't let you down,

1200
01:09:37,440 --> 01:09:38,441
sirs.

1201
01:09:38,600 --> 01:09:39,761
Not to mention,

1202
01:09:39,920 --> 01:09:42,810
your bid was far too attractive
for us to pass up.

1203
01:09:43,640 --> 01:09:47,440
Thank you. I mean, that's great to hear
because we really worked hard on this.

1204
01:09:47,640 --> 01:09:49,449
Sorry. Excuse me.

1205
01:09:50,120 --> 01:09:52,168
One of you just said

1206
01:09:52,760 --> 01:09:54,728
our bid was too attractive to pass up.

1207
01:09:54,960 --> 01:09:56,769
What did you mean by that, exactly?

1208
01:09:56,960 --> 01:09:59,964
He means you boys lowballed
the shit out of your competition.

1209
01:10:03,120 --> 01:10:04,610
Yeah. Uh...

1210
01:10:05,280 --> 01:10:06,441
By how much?

1211
01:10:06,960 --> 01:10:07,961
Millions.

1212
01:10:12,800 --> 01:10:14,245
Okay.

1213
01:10:15,920 --> 01:10:17,285
Just for me. I...

1214
01:10:18,280 --> 01:10:21,170
I'm curious, how many millions?

1215
01:10:21,520 --> 01:10:24,967
Well, technically, we're not supposed to
discuss that with you,

1216
01:10:27,160 --> 01:10:28,844
but what the hell.

1217
01:10:30,920 --> 01:10:35,130
You guys came in $53 million
lower than the nearest competition.

1218
01:10:36,280 --> 01:10:38,760
Fuck! Fuck!

1219
01:10:39,680 --> 01:10:40,841
Motherfucker!

1220
01:10:41,040 --> 01:10:43,884
$53 million.

1221
01:10:45,280 --> 01:10:46,850
We're okay.

1222
01:10:48,800 --> 01:10:50,040
Look at the bright side.

1223
01:10:50,280 --> 01:10:51,850
For once, the American taxpayer

1224
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:54,162
is getting a good deal
on a defense contract.

1225
01:10:54,440 --> 01:10:56,966
Man, fuck the American taxpayer.

1226
01:11:11,360 --> 01:11:12,566
Hello?

1227
01:11:16,200 --> 01:11:17,201
Iz?

1228
01:11:18,640 --> 01:11:21,689
Hey, Ella. Hi.

1229
01:11:22,680 --> 01:11:24,011
How are you, sweetie?

1230
01:11:24,640 --> 01:11:27,564
Hey. Do you know
where her blue sandals are?

1231
01:11:28,160 --> 01:11:29,366
Oh, hey.

1232
01:11:29,720 --> 01:11:31,529
Um, I'm not sure.

1233
01:11:32,320 --> 01:11:35,210
But listen, can we talk for a sec?

1234
01:11:35,440 --> 01:11:36,851
Mmm-hmm.

1235
01:11:37,360 --> 01:11:39,727
I need to go back to Albania
for a couple weeks.

1236
01:11:40,160 --> 01:11:41,685
A month, tops.

1237
01:11:42,920 --> 01:11:45,400
Sure. No problem.

1238
01:12:03,440 --> 01:12:05,442
Hey, what's going on?

1239
01:12:06,280 --> 01:12:09,090
Ella and I are going to stay
with my mom for a while.

1240
01:12:09,240 --> 01:12:10,765
What? What are you talking about?

1241
01:12:11,800 --> 01:12:12,801
Iz, what happened?

1242
01:12:13,040 --> 01:12:15,122
How come you didn't tell me
you went to Iraq?

1243
01:12:16,360 --> 01:12:17,771
I was looking for the plumber's number

1244
01:12:17,960 --> 01:12:20,247
on your computer and I saw the photos.

1245
01:12:21,760 --> 01:12:22,807
I can explain.

1246
01:12:23,880 --> 01:12:26,929
You said you never left
the hotel room in Jordan.

1247
01:12:27,080 --> 01:12:30,766
I know. Because I didn't
want to freak you out.

1248
01:12:31,120 --> 01:12:33,168
Why is it every time I catch you in a lie

1249
01:12:33,400 --> 01:12:36,768
you try to convince me
that you lied for my benefit?

1250
01:12:37,640 --> 01:12:40,325
At what point do you
just admit you're a liar?

1251
01:12:41,760 --> 01:12:43,603
Iz, would you stop, please?

1252
01:12:43,800 --> 01:12:46,565
We said we'd tell each other everything.

1253
01:12:47,400 --> 01:12:50,324
- You promised!
- I know! Okay, I fucked up.

1254
01:12:50,560 --> 01:12:52,483
What else aren't you telling me?

1255
01:12:52,760 --> 01:12:53,761
- Nothing.
- No.

1256
01:12:53,960 --> 01:12:55,291
Seriously.

1257
01:12:56,840 --> 01:12:59,241
You know everything now.

1258
01:13:04,760 --> 01:13:07,684
Okay. Aren't you going to ask me
why I called the plumber?

1259
01:13:07,960 --> 01:13:10,122
Yeah, sure. What happened?

1260
01:13:12,920 --> 01:13:15,764
The pipe is leaking in the guest bathroom.

1261
01:13:21,640 --> 01:13:23,005
I found this.

1262
01:13:24,800 --> 01:13:27,041
Let me guess.
You didn't want to freak me out?

1263
01:13:27,280 --> 01:13:28,327
Okay, hold on.

1264
01:13:28,520 --> 01:13:30,170
So I hid some money under the sink.

1265
01:13:30,360 --> 01:13:31,441
What's the big deal?

1266
01:13:31,640 --> 01:13:33,642
The big deal is you hid it from me!

1267
01:13:33,880 --> 01:13:34,881
No, I didn't!

1268
01:13:35,080 --> 01:13:36,650
Then who did you hide it from?

1269
01:13:41,160 --> 01:13:44,528
I don't know. It was stupid. You're right.

1270
01:13:50,160 --> 01:13:53,004
We're going to leave
before you think of something else to say.

1271
01:13:54,200 --> 01:13:55,884
Iz, I'm sorry.

1272
01:13:58,520 --> 01:13:59,851
Iz!

1273
01:14:06,240 --> 01:14:07,480
Oh, fuck.

1274
01:14:56,480 --> 01:14:58,005
Hey, what's up, man?

1275
01:14:58,200 --> 01:14:59,281
What's up?

1276
01:14:59,480 --> 01:15:00,527
Just getting ready to leave.

1277
01:15:03,880 --> 01:15:05,041
What is that?

1278
01:15:05,920 --> 01:15:08,730
I just wanted to thank you
for agreeing to go on this trip.

1279
01:15:10,160 --> 01:15:11,400
It's not lost on me,

1280
01:15:11,600 --> 01:15:13,887
the sacrifice you're making
for this company.

1281
01:15:14,080 --> 01:15:15,525
And I really appreciate it.

1282
01:15:17,400 --> 01:15:20,404
"To my partner, David.
The world is yours."

1283
01:15:22,920 --> 01:15:25,685
- It's from Scarface.
- Of course, man. I remember.

1284
01:15:27,560 --> 01:15:28,686
Thank you.

1285
01:15:29,360 --> 01:15:30,361
Yeah.

1286
01:15:31,280 --> 01:15:33,760
Uh, hey, before I go,

1287
01:15:34,080 --> 01:15:35,605
I just wanted...

1288
01:15:37,320 --> 01:15:38,321
What's this?

1289
01:15:38,560 --> 01:15:41,928
It's our partnership agreement. 70-30.

1290
01:15:42,120 --> 01:15:44,327
I just wanted to make it official.

1291
01:15:47,040 --> 01:15:48,280
Yeah, of course.

1292
01:15:49,840 --> 01:15:52,286
- It's a good idea.
- Cool.

1293
01:15:52,760 --> 01:15:56,207
Man, eight fucking weeks in Albania.

1294
01:15:56,440 --> 01:15:58,841
Iz is going to hate me forever.

1295
01:15:59,400 --> 01:16:02,961
No, she's going to suck your cock
every day for a year.

1296
01:16:06,600 --> 01:16:09,126
Because we're on the verge
of making $30 million.

1297
01:16:12,120 --> 01:16:13,406
Yeah, man.

1298
01:16:14,400 --> 01:16:16,243
Go crush it.

1299
01:16:16,840 --> 01:16:18,126
Thanks, bro.

1300
01:16:26,160 --> 01:16:27,286
Nice.

1301
01:16:37,600 --> 01:16:40,080
Hey, you've reached Iz.
You know what to do.

1302
01:16:40,360 --> 01:16:43,921
Come on, Iz. Don't cut me off like this.

1303
01:16:47,080 --> 01:16:49,367
I'm in Albania, at the hotel.

1304
01:16:50,800 --> 01:16:52,609
Left the number with your mom.

1305
01:16:52,800 --> 01:16:55,531
And if you could please just call me back

1306
01:16:55,720 --> 01:16:57,927
because I really miss you. Okay?

1307
01:16:58,120 --> 01:17:00,487
And I love you.

1308
01:17:01,920 --> 01:17:02,921
Bye.

1309
01:17:13,800 --> 01:17:15,131
Good morning, buddy.

1310
01:17:15,320 --> 01:17:16,845
Hey, Bashkim.

1311
01:17:17,680 --> 01:17:20,684
Oh, I bring you Kolonat.
It's our McDonald's.

1312
01:17:21,320 --> 01:17:23,402
Yeah, I'm good. But thanks.

1313
01:17:25,640 --> 01:17:27,290
We go to work now?

1314
01:17:42,080 --> 01:17:44,082
Uh-huh. No, no, no.
I said I need two trucks.

1315
01:17:44,280 --> 01:17:46,487
Yeah, you just got the one here right now.

1316
01:17:46,720 --> 01:17:49,883
Yeah. Look, I got a cargo
plane sitting at the airport.

1317
01:17:51,200 --> 01:17:52,929
Yeah, I know. I know.

1318
01:17:53,800 --> 01:17:54,801
Hey, let me call you right back.

1319
01:17:55,000 --> 01:17:56,331
Hey, stop! Stop, stop!

1320
01:17:56,560 --> 01:17:58,289
Hold up, hold up, hold up!
Hey, turn that off!

1321
01:17:58,520 --> 01:17:59,760
What the fuck is that?

1322
01:18:02,160 --> 01:18:04,288
Where did you get this?

1323
01:18:07,920 --> 01:18:08,921
Yo! What's up?

1324
01:18:09,160 --> 01:18:10,730
Hey, man, we got a problem.

1325
01:18:11,240 --> 01:18:13,561
- Where you at?
- I'm at Liv, bro.

1326
01:18:13,760 --> 01:18:16,366
Trying to bang some Cuban chick
who's waiting for me at my table.

1327
01:18:16,560 --> 01:18:17,561
Why, what do we got?

1328
01:18:17,760 --> 01:18:20,481
Let me get this straight. I'm in Albania
right now freezing my ass off.

1329
01:18:20,680 --> 01:18:21,966
You're at Liv, trying to get laid?

1330
01:18:22,200 --> 01:18:23,611
David, it's 1:00 a.m. here.

1331
01:18:23,840 --> 01:18:25,285
I'm blowing off some steam.

1332
01:18:25,480 --> 01:18:27,244
Yeah, 1:00 a.m. is when you're
supposed to be at the office

1333
01:18:27,440 --> 01:18:30,131
because that's the middle of fucking day
in every country we do business with.

1334
01:18:30,320 --> 01:18:32,561
Look, we got a problem
with the AK ammunition.

1335
01:18:33,080 --> 01:18:35,481
- What kind of problem?
- It's Chinese.

1336
01:18:35,680 --> 01:18:38,445
Chinese, bro?
What does that even mean, Chinese?

1337
01:18:38,640 --> 01:18:40,165
It means it's from China.

1338
01:18:40,400 --> 01:18:43,722
What are you talking about?
I was there, I saw the ammo.

1339
01:18:43,920 --> 01:18:44,921
We both did.

1340
01:18:45,120 --> 01:18:46,281
Yeah, look, I don't know what to tell you.

1341
01:18:46,440 --> 01:18:47,680
They fucked us. Okay? We got played.

1342
01:18:48,040 --> 01:18:50,611
Hold on. How do you even
know it's Chinese?

1343
01:18:50,800 --> 01:18:53,610
There's Chinese writing
on every fucking crate.

1344
01:18:53,800 --> 01:18:55,609
Trust me, it's Chinese.

1345
01:19:04,880 --> 01:19:05,881
Yeah.

1346
01:19:06,120 --> 01:19:07,121
Henry, what the fuck!

1347
01:19:07,280 --> 01:19:08,930
We've been trying to reach you
for two days!

1348
01:19:09,200 --> 01:19:10,201
It's Efraim and David.

1349
01:19:10,440 --> 01:19:11,851
We have a serious fucking problem.

1350
01:19:13,280 --> 01:19:14,281
I'm listening.

1351
01:19:14,520 --> 01:19:16,648
The AK ammunition, it's Chinese.

1352
01:19:16,840 --> 01:19:18,729
What, you think the Afghans
who are getting

1353
01:19:18,920 --> 01:19:22,003
shot up by the Taliban give a shit
where their ammo comes from?

1354
01:19:22,200 --> 01:19:23,645
No, but the Pentagon does.

1355
01:19:23,840 --> 01:19:25,365
Henry, you know we can't use Chinese!

1356
01:19:25,560 --> 01:19:27,289
America has an embargo against China.

1357
01:19:27,480 --> 01:19:31,246
You had your boys show us the one crate
of Albanian ammo in the entire country.

1358
01:19:31,440 --> 01:19:33,886
I'm sorry, did anyone prevent you
from inspecting the other crates?

1359
01:19:34,120 --> 01:19:37,488
Did you even bother to ask
what the country of origin was?

1360
01:19:37,680 --> 01:19:39,011
Who the fuck would ask that?

1361
01:19:39,400 --> 01:19:43,086
Henry, I'm staring at 100 million rounds

1362
01:19:43,280 --> 01:19:46,045
of illegal Chinese ammunition
that you sold us.

1363
01:19:46,240 --> 01:19:47,480
What are we supposed to do?

1364
01:19:47,800 --> 01:19:49,484
Do your fucking job!

1365
01:19:51,520 --> 01:19:53,761
The U.S. government
wants to look the other way.

1366
01:19:53,960 --> 01:19:55,007
Don't give them a reason not to.

1367
01:19:55,200 --> 01:19:57,771
And while you're at it,
learn the difference between

1368
01:19:57,960 --> 01:20:00,725
"We have a problem"
and "You have a problem."

1369
01:20:01,880 --> 01:20:02,881
Fuck!

1370
01:20:23,240 --> 01:20:25,607
We were fucked. The ammo was worthless

1371
01:20:25,840 --> 01:20:28,889
and I was stuck in Albania
trying to piece together new suppliers

1372
01:20:29,080 --> 01:20:31,481
from all over Eastern Europe.

1373
01:20:54,880 --> 01:20:55,881
Holy shit.

1374
01:20:56,120 --> 01:20:57,565
What the fuck are you doing here, man?

1375
01:20:57,760 --> 01:20:58,841
I have a big idea.

1376
01:20:59,800 --> 01:21:01,006
How did you get in my room?

1377
01:21:01,200 --> 01:21:02,486
They let me in.

1378
01:21:03,280 --> 01:21:04,645
I'm a trustworthy guy.

1379
01:21:04,960 --> 01:21:07,531
Not only did they let me in,
they brought me room service.

1380
01:21:08,160 --> 01:21:10,606
Anyway, I have a big fucking idea.

1381
01:21:11,120 --> 01:21:12,326
Yeah? What's that?

1382
01:21:12,560 --> 01:21:13,800
What if we repack?

1383
01:21:14,320 --> 01:21:15,321
Repack what?

1384
01:21:15,520 --> 01:21:16,521
The bullets!

1385
01:21:16,960 --> 01:21:18,610
What if we repack them all?

1386
01:21:18,840 --> 01:21:20,171
100 million rounds?

1387
01:21:20,400 --> 01:21:23,131
David, it can be done.

1388
01:21:23,320 --> 01:21:26,881
Think about it.
We'll also save a fortune on shipping.

1389
01:21:27,080 --> 01:21:29,162
We trade out all the big,
heavy wooden crates

1390
01:21:29,400 --> 01:21:30,925
for light cardboard boxes.

1391
01:21:31,120 --> 01:21:33,202
Yeah, but it would still be Chinese ammo.

1392
01:21:33,800 --> 01:21:35,643
Look at this towel. Okay?

1393
01:21:36,400 --> 01:21:38,767
Turkish. Made in Turkey.

1394
01:21:40,560 --> 01:21:43,484
Not anymore. Now it's an Albanian towel.

1395
01:21:44,400 --> 01:21:48,041
It's only Chinese
if the packaging says it's Chinese.

1396
01:21:50,480 --> 01:21:53,927
Yeah. But I mean, that's
also fucking illegal, man.

1397
01:21:54,840 --> 01:21:56,569
We have two options.

1398
01:21:56,800 --> 01:21:59,041
We either repack this shit and send it off

1399
01:21:59,240 --> 01:22:01,971
or we can walk away
from a $300 million-deal.

1400
01:22:03,480 --> 01:22:05,130
What do you want to do?

1401
01:22:05,720 --> 01:22:10,169
When you put it like that
there's really only one option.

1402
01:22:11,160 --> 01:22:13,481
Our driver Bashkim
introduced us to his friend

1403
01:22:13,680 --> 01:22:16,047
who owned a boxing and storage company
out of Tirana.

1404
01:22:16,600 --> 01:22:19,046
This is Enver. I grew up with him.

1405
01:22:19,280 --> 01:22:20,281
Nice to meet you, Enver.

1406
01:22:20,480 --> 01:22:24,201
You too. Bashkim told me
a little about your situation.

1407
01:22:24,400 --> 01:22:27,051
Yeah, look, to put it simply,
we have a weight problem.

1408
01:22:27,240 --> 01:22:29,208
We're shipping
a large quantity of ammunition

1409
01:22:29,400 --> 01:22:31,129
from Albania to Afghanistan.

1410
01:22:31,320 --> 01:22:32,765
Right now, it's packed in heavy tins

1411
01:22:32,960 --> 01:22:34,166
inside big wooden crates.

1412
01:22:34,360 --> 01:22:35,566
And what we would like to do

1413
01:22:35,800 --> 01:22:37,564
is to transfer those bullets
into plastic bags

1414
01:22:37,800 --> 01:22:39,211
and then put those in double-walled,

1415
01:22:39,400 --> 01:22:40,765
corrugated fiberboard boxes.

1416
01:22:42,840 --> 01:22:43,921
Do you know what those are?

1417
01:22:44,320 --> 01:22:46,527
Yeah, of course. For what reason?

1418
01:22:46,960 --> 01:22:47,961
We just told you.

1419
01:22:48,200 --> 01:22:49,531
What the fuck is it with this country?

1420
01:22:50,960 --> 01:22:54,646
The original packaging, it's too heavy.

1421
01:22:55,120 --> 01:22:57,691
Too many crates. We need to streamline.

1422
01:22:58,360 --> 01:23:00,249
Okay. How many crates?

1423
01:23:00,440 --> 01:23:03,410
A lot. It's 100 million
rounds of ammunition.

1424
01:23:03,600 --> 01:23:08,083
Understood. But how many actual crates?

1425
01:23:09,880 --> 01:23:13,327
We have 68,520 crates.

1426
01:23:15,000 --> 01:23:16,286
I've seen it.

1427
01:23:16,480 --> 01:23:18,164
It's fucking crazy.

1428
01:23:43,960 --> 01:23:44,961
Done.

1429
01:23:57,600 --> 01:24:00,001
So 50 men, eight weeks.

1430
01:24:00,360 --> 01:24:04,445
I can do it for $100,000.

1431
01:24:05,720 --> 01:24:07,609
100,000 U.S. dollars?

1432
01:24:07,960 --> 01:24:08,961
Yeah.

1433
01:24:09,480 --> 01:24:12,324
- Give us a second.
- Yeah. One second, please.

1434
01:24:13,400 --> 01:24:16,370
Okay. I'm going to talk very seriously.

1435
01:24:16,840 --> 01:24:18,046
It was hard not to laugh.

1436
01:24:18,280 --> 01:24:21,204
I mean, not only was this guy
saving the entire deal,

1437
01:24:21,400 --> 01:24:22,925
but by repacking all the ammo

1438
01:24:23,160 --> 01:24:26,528
we would increase our profit margin
by almost $3 million.

1439
01:24:26,920 --> 01:24:28,251
Where should we get dinner tonight?

1440
01:24:28,560 --> 01:24:30,722
There's this place by the hotel.
It's pretty good.

1441
01:24:30,960 --> 01:24:33,122
Okay. All right, go ahead.

1442
01:24:33,440 --> 01:24:34,601
Okay, deal.

1443
01:24:41,280 --> 01:24:43,123
It was even better than we thought.

1444
01:24:43,400 --> 01:24:46,688
We were trading heavy wooden crates
for light cardboard boxes.

1445
01:24:46,880 --> 01:24:49,645
Eight ounce tins for plastic bags.

1446
01:24:50,720 --> 01:24:52,085
By repacking the ammo,

1447
01:24:52,280 --> 01:24:54,886
we would lighten our overall load
by 180 tons.

1448
01:24:56,920 --> 01:24:59,287
180 fucking tons!

1449
01:24:59,480 --> 01:25:03,166
That meant fewer flights
using lighter planes burning less fuel.

1450
01:25:04,720 --> 01:25:07,883
Which all added up to more money for us.

1451
01:25:12,640 --> 01:25:14,927
On December 8th, 2007,

1452
01:25:15,120 --> 01:25:17,361
AEY delivered the first 5 million rounds

1453
01:25:17,560 --> 01:25:19,562
to the Afghan army.

1454
01:25:21,520 --> 01:25:23,409
It went off without a hitch.

1455
01:25:30,200 --> 01:25:32,362
Come on, just say it once, sweetie.
Come on.

1456
01:25:32,600 --> 01:25:35,604
Say "dada." Say "dada."

1457
01:25:36,640 --> 01:25:37,880
We really have to go, David.

1458
01:25:38,080 --> 01:25:40,447
No, hey, five more minutes,
please? Please?

1459
01:25:41,840 --> 01:25:44,002
We're about to eat. My mom's waiting.

1460
01:25:45,240 --> 01:25:48,289
Ella, wave goodbye to Daddy. Hmm.

1461
01:25:48,560 --> 01:25:49,766
Bye-bye, Ella.

1462
01:25:50,360 --> 01:25:52,169
Merry Christmas. I love you.

1463
01:25:54,720 --> 01:25:57,326
Hey, can you give her to your mom
so that we can talk for a minute?

1464
01:25:57,600 --> 01:25:58,601
I'm sorry, David.

1465
01:25:58,840 --> 01:26:01,081
We'll call you in a couple days. Okay?

1466
01:26:03,120 --> 01:26:04,121
Bye.

1467
01:26:25,400 --> 01:26:26,401
Hey, this is David.

1468
01:26:26,600 --> 01:26:29,285
Bro, you want to hear
something totally fucked up?

1469
01:26:29,480 --> 01:26:31,209
Merry Christmas, Efraim.

1470
01:26:31,400 --> 01:26:32,481
It's Christmas?

1471
01:26:32,680 --> 01:26:33,727
That's why nobody's here.

1472
01:26:33,920 --> 01:26:36,241
I was about to fire the entire office.

1473
01:26:36,440 --> 01:26:38,124
Anyway, when I was over there,

1474
01:26:38,320 --> 01:26:40,322
I was talking to our boy, Bashkim.

1475
01:26:40,520 --> 01:26:41,601
Did you know his uncle

1476
01:26:41,840 --> 01:26:44,127
works at the Albanian defense ministry?

1477
01:26:44,320 --> 01:26:45,321
No, I didn't know that.

1478
01:26:45,560 --> 01:26:46,561
Well, he does.

1479
01:26:46,800 --> 01:26:49,531
So I said, "You know what would be
interesting to me, Bashkim?

1480
01:26:49,760 --> 01:26:54,084
"I'd be curious to know what Henry
is paying the Albanians for the AK ammo."

1481
01:26:54,280 --> 01:26:55,281
Efraim?

1482
01:26:55,520 --> 01:26:57,045
Do you know what he found out?

1483
01:26:57,240 --> 01:27:00,722
That motherfucker is paying
two and a half cents a round.

1484
01:27:00,920 --> 01:27:03,002
He's charging us a 400% markup!

1485
01:27:03,200 --> 01:27:05,009
Yeah. So what? We do the same thing.

1486
01:27:05,240 --> 01:27:06,526
Yeah, but this is our contract.

1487
01:27:06,720 --> 01:27:09,371
And we almost lost it because of him
and his Chinese fucking bullets.

1488
01:27:09,560 --> 01:27:10,561
But we didn't lose it.

1489
01:27:10,760 --> 01:27:11,841
That's not the point!

1490
01:27:12,080 --> 01:27:14,447
I want to figure out a way
to cut this cocksucker out of the deal.

1491
01:27:14,640 --> 01:27:15,880
Efraim, stop.

1492
01:27:16,120 --> 01:27:17,167
No, listen to me.

1493
01:27:17,360 --> 01:27:19,044
I'm serious, man.

1494
01:27:19,240 --> 01:27:20,480
We're making money, okay?

1495
01:27:20,680 --> 01:27:23,524
He's making money,
the whole thing is fucking working.

1496
01:27:23,720 --> 01:27:25,085
Don't mess with it.

1497
01:27:25,280 --> 01:27:27,726
I don't give a fuck. He's ripping us off!

1498
01:27:28,920 --> 01:27:29,921
Look, I'm serious, okay?

1499
01:27:30,120 --> 01:27:32,805
I'm going to be on the next flight
out of here if you pull that shit.

1500
01:27:33,200 --> 01:27:36,807
Whoa. Bro, you don't have to threaten me.

1501
01:27:37,000 --> 01:27:38,445
All right? I'm your partner.

1502
01:27:38,720 --> 01:27:40,563
Yeah, it doesn't always feel like that.

1503
01:27:41,560 --> 01:27:43,403
I found this deal. And I'm over here

1504
01:27:43,600 --> 01:27:46,171
doing all the work and you're in Miami
trying to sabotage it.

1505
01:27:46,480 --> 01:27:48,289
How am I sabotaging it?

1506
01:27:48,480 --> 01:27:51,723
By trying to fuck over Henry,
the way you fuck over everybody else.

1507
01:27:56,120 --> 01:27:59,647
You're right. Henry's our partner.

1508
01:28:01,520 --> 01:28:04,603
He's the reason we got this deal.

1509
01:28:05,400 --> 01:28:08,847
I was just looking out for us
and I took it too far.

1510
01:28:10,400 --> 01:28:12,562
Don't sweat it, bro. I'll leave it alone.

1511
01:28:12,800 --> 01:28:13,926
Thank you.

1512
01:28:14,640 --> 01:28:16,881
We can't push our luck
with this shit, man.

1513
01:28:19,040 --> 01:28:21,805
All right, I'll talk to you soon. Bye.

1514
01:28:32,080 --> 01:28:33,241
Whoa. What the fuck? Hey.

1515
01:28:34,560 --> 01:28:35,561
Fuck! Stop.

1516
01:29:18,600 --> 01:29:20,204
Stop! I don't understand!

1517
01:29:30,960 --> 01:29:32,962
Do you understand now?

1518
01:29:33,600 --> 01:29:36,001
Yeah. Yes.

1519
01:29:36,600 --> 01:29:39,763
Did you really think
you could cut me out of my own deal?

1520
01:29:42,680 --> 01:29:43,681
Please.

1521
01:30:01,880 --> 01:30:02,881
Fuck.

1522
01:30:04,520 --> 01:30:05,521
Fuck.

1523
01:30:20,120 --> 01:30:21,281
David, we need to talk.

1524
01:30:21,520 --> 01:30:22,806
Now's not a good time.

1525
01:30:25,360 --> 01:30:27,283
I have not been paid yet.

1526
01:30:27,520 --> 01:30:29,010
What do you mean? Like for the month?

1527
01:30:29,200 --> 01:30:30,406
Ever.

1528
01:30:30,680 --> 01:30:32,489
You haven't been paid anything?

1529
01:30:32,760 --> 01:30:35,081
Your partner doesn't return phone calls.

1530
01:30:35,320 --> 01:30:37,163
My guys need to be paid.

1531
01:30:37,360 --> 01:30:39,601
They are going to stop work.

1532
01:30:40,880 --> 01:30:42,564
David, I know the real reason

1533
01:30:42,760 --> 01:30:44,444
that you want ammunition repacked.

1534
01:30:49,040 --> 01:30:50,565
Okay, look, Enver. Listen to me.

1535
01:30:50,760 --> 01:30:53,047
I gotta fly to Miami right now.
I'll be back in a week.

1536
01:30:53,200 --> 01:30:55,361
But I promise you, the first thing
that I'm going do when I land

1537
01:30:55,600 --> 01:30:57,728
is make sure
you get your money wired, okay?

1538
01:31:01,440 --> 01:31:02,441
Okay.

1539
01:31:07,640 --> 01:31:08,641
David.

1540
01:31:09,040 --> 01:31:10,201
Airport, let's go.

1541
01:31:11,880 --> 01:31:12,961
David.

1542
01:31:13,520 --> 01:31:15,727
Look, I'm late for a flight.
I'll be back next week.

1543
01:31:15,920 --> 01:31:17,968
She said her husband
didn't come home last night.

1544
01:31:19,960 --> 01:31:21,769
Okay, what do you want me to do?

1545
01:31:25,880 --> 01:31:28,008
She's very worried. It is not like him.

1546
01:31:28,720 --> 01:31:30,370
Tell her I don't know her husband.

1547
01:31:30,560 --> 01:31:31,561
Who's your husband?

1548
01:31:31,840 --> 01:31:33,683
Bashkim.

1549
01:31:44,720 --> 01:31:47,041
No one ever heard from Bashkim again.

1550
01:31:47,240 --> 01:31:50,642
They never found a note,
they never found a body.

1551
01:31:51,600 --> 01:31:53,364
He just fell off the planet.

1552
01:31:57,280 --> 01:31:58,884
I was done with Albania.

1553
01:32:00,200 --> 01:32:02,123
I was never going back.

1554
01:32:12,360 --> 01:32:13,361
Hi.

1555
01:32:14,840 --> 01:32:15,841
Hey.

1556
01:32:16,680 --> 01:32:20,207
The reason I went to Albania
was to repackage Chinese ammunition

1557
01:32:20,400 --> 01:32:23,210
so we could disguise it
and sell it to the U.S. government.

1558
01:32:25,120 --> 01:32:27,168
That sounds illegal.

1559
01:32:27,880 --> 01:32:29,928
It is. But I'm done.

1560
01:32:30,840 --> 01:32:33,491
I swear, no matter what happens
for the rest of my life

1561
01:32:33,680 --> 01:32:35,409
I'm never going to lie to you again.

1562
01:32:41,400 --> 01:32:42,686
Mmm-hmm.

1563
01:32:43,960 --> 01:32:45,564
I love you so much, Iz.

1564
01:32:53,360 --> 01:32:55,840
What happened to your nose?

1565
01:32:57,000 --> 01:32:59,048
I was kidnapped by Albanian gangsters.

1566
01:32:59,840 --> 01:33:02,571
- I think it's broken.
- Oh, my God.

1567
01:33:05,960 --> 01:33:08,440
I think I'm going to go back
to being a massage therapist.

1568
01:33:08,800 --> 01:33:10,040
Is that okay?

1569
01:33:12,160 --> 01:33:13,605
Yes.

1570
01:33:16,160 --> 01:33:17,844
It was always okay.

1571
01:33:41,880 --> 01:33:43,370
Hey, you're back.

1572
01:33:54,800 --> 01:33:55,961
Whoa!

1573
01:33:56,160 --> 01:33:58,401
Bro, what are you doing back?
What happened to your face?

1574
01:33:58,600 --> 01:34:00,568
That's everything that's been delivered
on the Afghan deal.

1575
01:34:00,720 --> 01:34:01,881
I want my cut. I'm out.

1576
01:34:03,560 --> 01:34:04,766
What are you talking about?

1577
01:34:05,200 --> 01:34:07,362
He put a fucking gun to my head, man.

1578
01:34:07,800 --> 01:34:08,881
Who, Henry?

1579
01:34:09,120 --> 01:34:10,690
You said that you were going
to leave it alone.

1580
01:34:12,600 --> 01:34:14,250
Oh, fuck.

1581
01:34:15,720 --> 01:34:17,688
I fucked up.

1582
01:34:19,040 --> 01:34:20,087
I'm done, Efraim.

1583
01:34:20,280 --> 01:34:22,282
Look, you don't have to go back.

1584
01:34:22,520 --> 01:34:23,885
I hired this new guy, Ivan.

1585
01:34:24,200 --> 01:34:25,929
- He speaks Albanian.
- I'm done.

1586
01:34:32,080 --> 01:34:34,481
What, do you think
I just got 4 million bucks laying around?

1587
01:34:34,800 --> 01:34:36,040
I've thought it through.

1588
01:34:36,240 --> 01:34:38,208
I'll take 40 cents on the dollar.

1589
01:34:44,320 --> 01:34:46,243
Yeah, I thought it through too.

1590
01:34:46,600 --> 01:34:47,761
How about this?

1591
01:34:48,160 --> 01:34:49,889
How about zero cents on the dollar?

1592
01:34:50,400 --> 01:34:53,165
Let me remind you that we have a contract.

1593
01:34:53,400 --> 01:34:54,686
Fuck your contract!

1594
01:34:55,000 --> 01:34:56,445
If I asked you to build me a house,

1595
01:34:56,600 --> 01:34:59,640
and you quit after building me half a house,
you think I owe you half the money?

1596
01:34:59,920 --> 01:35:01,922
Is this a fucking joke, David?

1597
01:35:02,120 --> 01:35:04,600
You have two weeks.
Otherwise, you'll hear from my lawyer.

1598
01:35:05,280 --> 01:35:06,850
Who, Warren?

1599
01:35:07,280 --> 01:35:09,442
Are you talking about Warren?
He's my lawyer too.

1600
01:35:09,680 --> 01:35:10,841
I introduced you to him.

1601
01:35:11,480 --> 01:35:12,925
Fucking Warren.

1602
01:35:23,440 --> 01:35:24,601
Fuck!

1603
01:35:49,200 --> 01:35:52,124
AEY. How may I direct your call?

1604
01:36:15,240 --> 01:36:16,730
We fight.

1605
01:36:18,480 --> 01:36:19,845
Fight with our families,

1606
01:36:20,080 --> 01:36:21,809
fight with our business associates.

1607
01:36:23,080 --> 01:36:25,128
Sometimes we fight with our friends.

1608
01:36:25,400 --> 01:36:26,401
If God were here,

1609
01:36:26,600 --> 01:36:27,965
we'd probably fight with Him too.

1610
01:36:31,920 --> 01:36:35,288
Efraim has a heavy heart
over what's happened.

1611
01:36:37,920 --> 01:36:41,447
No offense, Ralph, but I'm not sure
you've ever met the real Efraim.

1612
01:36:42,480 --> 01:36:44,801
He's a complicated young man.

1613
01:36:45,840 --> 01:36:47,763
But he just wants to sit down and talk.

1614
01:36:48,360 --> 01:36:49,805
Find a fair solution.

1615
01:36:51,520 --> 01:36:53,249
He's asked me to mediate.

1616
01:36:57,400 --> 01:36:59,164
Let me help you, David.

1617
01:37:01,080 --> 01:37:03,401
I just don't know if I'm ready yet.

1618
01:37:03,600 --> 01:37:04,647
All right, here he is.

1619
01:37:14,880 --> 01:37:16,006
Hey, bro.

1620
01:37:17,840 --> 01:37:19,922
Good to see you.

1621
01:37:27,480 --> 01:37:29,528
Sorry things have gotten so crazy.

1622
01:37:30,080 --> 01:37:31,730
Yeah. Me too.

1623
01:37:31,920 --> 01:37:33,570
You having anything, hon?

1624
01:37:33,760 --> 01:37:35,808
I'll just have a coffee. Thanks.

1625
01:37:38,280 --> 01:37:39,964
I've thought about it a lot.

1626
01:37:42,120 --> 01:37:44,600
And I don't want you to walk away
from this empty-handed.

1627
01:37:45,640 --> 01:37:46,801
Cool.

1628
01:37:47,040 --> 01:37:49,611
So I had Warren draft up
a severance agreement.

1629
01:37:49,840 --> 01:37:51,285
And I think it's pretty fair.

1630
01:37:52,440 --> 01:37:56,411
I'm prepared to pay you 50K per year
for the next four years.

1631
01:37:58,840 --> 01:38:00,046
200 grand?

1632
01:38:02,840 --> 01:38:04,524
Is this a fucking joke, man?

1633
01:38:07,400 --> 01:38:09,084
Is this what you meant by mediation?

1634
01:38:09,320 --> 01:38:10,560
In all fairness, there was never

1635
01:38:10,760 --> 01:38:12,728
a partnership agreement,
no prior contract.

1636
01:38:14,240 --> 01:38:16,971
Yeah. I have something better
than a partnership agreement.

1637
01:38:17,200 --> 01:38:18,964
I have proof.

1638
01:38:19,200 --> 01:38:21,680
Before I left Albania, I took everything.

1639
01:38:21,880 --> 01:38:22,881
What the fuck.

1640
01:38:23,160 --> 01:38:25,811
All the documents we forged,
photos of repacking.

1641
01:38:26,080 --> 01:38:27,081
- David!
- Repacking?

1642
01:38:27,280 --> 01:38:28,520
- He didn't tell you?
- David!

1643
01:38:28,720 --> 01:38:30,131
Oh, yeah, we took that money you gave us,

1644
01:38:30,320 --> 01:38:33,164
and we bought 100 million rounds
of illegal Chinese ammunition,

1645
01:38:33,480 --> 01:38:36,211
then we repackaged it
and sold it to the U.S. Military.

1646
01:38:36,400 --> 01:38:39,085
Yeah, and we made
$8 million doing it, asshole.

1647
01:38:39,280 --> 01:38:40,281
Careful, Efraim.

1648
01:38:40,440 --> 01:38:41,930
We told Ralph we only made
$3 million on that one.

1649
01:38:42,120 --> 01:38:43,121
Wait, what now?

1650
01:38:43,360 --> 01:38:44,964
He sends you fake accounting
reports every month.

1651
01:38:45,160 --> 01:38:46,844
- Oh, fuck off.
- I make them on my laptop.

1652
01:38:47,040 --> 01:38:48,326
Now you're just making shit up.

1653
01:38:48,560 --> 01:38:50,722
Really? Because I kept everything,
you dumb fuck!

1654
01:38:50,920 --> 01:38:53,571
I even have copies of the bank statements
that we photoshopped

1655
01:38:53,760 --> 01:38:54,807
and sent to the government.

1656
01:38:55,000 --> 01:38:57,082
Get the fuck out of here.

1657
01:38:58,440 --> 01:39:00,124
I can bury you.

1658
01:39:04,920 --> 01:39:06,046
Us.

1659
01:39:08,760 --> 01:39:10,364
I think you meant to say,

1660
01:39:10,720 --> 01:39:12,882
you can bury us.

1661
01:39:15,200 --> 01:39:17,202
Because anything that implicates me,

1662
01:39:17,800 --> 01:39:18,881
implicates you as well.

1663
01:39:19,080 --> 01:39:20,206
- Efraim, wait.
- No, no, no.

1664
01:39:20,400 --> 01:39:23,961
I came here today prepared
to pay you $200,000.

1665
01:39:25,840 --> 01:39:28,525
Now I'm not even going to pay
for breakfast.

1666
01:39:39,000 --> 01:39:41,844
Oh. What's going on over here? Huh?

1667
01:39:42,080 --> 01:39:43,081
Hello?

1668
01:39:43,280 --> 01:39:45,123
May I speak with David Packouz?

1669
01:39:45,320 --> 01:39:47,322
- Yeah, who's this?
- Hi, David.

1670
01:39:47,520 --> 01:39:50,603
This is C. J. Chivers
with The New York Times.

1671
01:39:50,800 --> 01:39:53,451
I was wondering if you had a minute
to talk about AEY,

1672
01:39:53,640 --> 01:39:56,962
and the alleged repackaging
of Chinese ammunition.

1673
01:39:58,560 --> 01:40:00,085
I don't know what you're talking about.

1674
01:40:00,280 --> 01:40:02,408
Well, according to my source,
there's an ongoing investigation

1675
01:40:02,600 --> 01:40:03,601
at the State Department.

1676
01:40:03,840 --> 01:40:05,444
And I was hoping
to get some clarification...

1677
01:40:14,600 --> 01:40:17,888
David, this sounds pretty serious.

1678
01:40:18,080 --> 01:40:19,411
Yeah, I know.

1679
01:40:20,520 --> 01:40:22,124
Maybe you should call my uncle.

1680
01:40:22,880 --> 01:40:24,086
The lawyer.

1681
01:40:25,080 --> 01:40:27,651
Oh, my God. Okay.

1682
01:40:27,840 --> 01:40:29,444
That's a good idea.

1683
01:40:33,720 --> 01:40:36,246
Hey, give me a minute.
I'll meet you guys in the lobby.

1684
01:40:45,400 --> 01:40:47,721
You just get a call
from The New York Times?

1685
01:40:48,040 --> 01:40:49,041
Yeah.

1686
01:40:54,720 --> 01:40:55,881
Me too.

1687
01:41:01,560 --> 01:41:03,881
You know, Scarface was on TV last night,

1688
01:41:04,440 --> 01:41:07,330
and I was watching it and thinking about
when we were little

1689
01:41:08,200 --> 01:41:10,851
and we used to do the lines
from the movie.

1690
01:41:13,360 --> 01:41:15,362
You're my best friend, David.

1691
01:41:17,520 --> 01:41:20,000
God, I really fucked this up, didn't I?

1692
01:41:25,240 --> 01:41:26,924
I'm sorry, bro.

1693
01:41:32,320 --> 01:41:33,481
Wow.

1694
01:41:34,000 --> 01:41:36,048
Are you ever not acting, man?

1695
01:41:37,680 --> 01:41:38,727
What does that mean?

1696
01:41:38,920 --> 01:41:41,287
You just tell me
what you think I want to hear,

1697
01:41:41,480 --> 01:41:42,481
because The New York Times called,

1698
01:41:42,680 --> 01:41:44,682
and you're freaking out
that I might say something.

1699
01:41:47,280 --> 01:41:48,486
Just admit it.

1700
01:41:49,160 --> 01:41:51,208
We were never best friends.

1701
01:41:51,840 --> 01:41:54,047
You were just playing
the part of my best friend.

1702
01:41:56,440 --> 01:41:57,965
Yeah.

1703
01:42:05,120 --> 01:42:07,646
Scarface wasn't even on TV last night.

1704
01:42:12,320 --> 01:42:13,765
You're such a piece of shit.

1705
01:42:14,760 --> 01:42:16,603
- Fuck!
- Fuck you.

1706
01:42:17,640 --> 01:42:19,688
- Fuck.
- Little bitch.

1707
01:42:23,720 --> 01:42:25,324
Well, that saves us a trip.

1708
01:43:01,760 --> 01:43:03,967
Out of all the illegal shit we did,

1709
01:43:04,720 --> 01:43:07,007
all the lies we told the government,

1710
01:43:08,520 --> 01:43:11,000
in the end, the thing that did us in?

1711
01:43:11,240 --> 01:43:15,086
Yes, I'm trying to reach
the Department of Defense, please.

1712
01:43:16,360 --> 01:43:18,886
Efraim never paid the box guy.

1713
01:43:20,840 --> 01:43:23,047
To who do you report a crime?

1714
01:43:24,960 --> 01:43:26,724
After Enver called the Pentagon,

1715
01:43:26,920 --> 01:43:29,446
the State Department launched
a full-scale investigation,

1716
01:43:29,680 --> 01:43:31,489
that went on for months.

1717
01:43:34,520 --> 01:43:38,206
They busted Ralph at one of his shops
in the middle of a work day.

1718
01:43:40,560 --> 01:43:43,643
He was horrified
and couldn't make a deal fast enough.

1719
01:43:44,840 --> 01:43:49,084
All that bullshit about him wanting
to mediate a truce between Efraim and I...

1720
01:43:50,280 --> 01:43:51,406
It was a setup.

1721
01:43:51,600 --> 01:43:53,204
Oh, yeah, we took that money you gave us,

1722
01:43:53,360 --> 01:43:56,125
and we bought 100 million rounds
of illegal Chinese ammunition,

1723
01:43:56,320 --> 01:43:59,563
then we repackaged it
and sold it to the U.S. Military.

1724
01:43:59,840 --> 01:44:01,490
They had us dead to rights.

1725
01:44:01,800 --> 01:44:03,370
It was pathetic.

1726
01:44:03,840 --> 01:44:07,811
While going through Efraim's computer,
they even found a to-do list that said,

1727
01:44:08,000 --> 01:44:10,082
"Repackage Chinese ammo. "

1728
01:44:11,040 --> 01:44:13,486
The story tonight
that has Pentagon officials scrambling.

1729
01:44:13,680 --> 01:44:18,607
How did two 20-something young men
land a big Pentagon contract?

1730
01:44:18,760 --> 01:44:21,929
Federal agents arrested both men
last week, charging them with fraud

1731
01:44:22,120 --> 01:44:25,249
for selling outdated, defective
Chinese ammunition

1732
01:44:25,480 --> 01:44:26,845
to the Pentagon.

1733
01:44:27,600 --> 01:44:29,967
Efraim was charged
with over 70 federal crimes

1734
01:44:30,200 --> 01:44:32,567
and sentenced to four years in prison.

1735
01:44:34,280 --> 01:44:37,762
I pled guilty and was sentenced
to seven months house arrest.

1736
01:44:44,240 --> 01:44:47,403
Congress called the Afghanistan contract
a case study

1737
01:44:47,600 --> 01:44:51,002
in all that is wrong
with the government's procurement process.

1738
01:44:58,800 --> 01:45:05,809
In 2022, AEY will be eligible once again
to bid on Federal contracts.

1739
01:45:16,560 --> 01:45:17,800
How's it going?

1740
01:45:20,680 --> 01:45:21,841
It's okay.

1741
01:45:23,440 --> 01:45:26,364
If I wanted you dead,
you'd already be dead.

1742
01:45:30,800 --> 01:45:33,246
I guess it's going all right then.

1743
01:45:34,640 --> 01:45:35,766
Come in.

1744
01:45:42,200 --> 01:45:43,964
How's your baby?

1745
01:45:44,160 --> 01:45:45,650
It's a girl, right?

1746
01:45:45,840 --> 01:45:47,729
Yeah. She's good.

1747
01:45:48,480 --> 01:45:49,891
I got three.

1748
01:45:51,120 --> 01:45:52,246
All girls.

1749
01:45:53,080 --> 01:45:54,570
They tell you it gets better.

1750
01:45:54,760 --> 01:45:56,967
That's not true, it gets worse.

1751
01:45:57,600 --> 01:45:59,250
That's why I like the arms business.

1752
01:45:59,440 --> 01:46:01,647
No women.

1753
01:46:13,960 --> 01:46:16,440
I want to apologize about Albania.

1754
01:46:19,080 --> 01:46:22,641
I had bad information.

1755
01:46:25,520 --> 01:46:30,890
So you stuffed me in the trunk of a car
and shoved a gun in my face by mistake?

1756
01:46:31,080 --> 01:46:32,127
Yeah.

1757
01:46:34,360 --> 01:46:37,443
I'm not a bad man,
but in certain situations,

1758
01:46:38,640 --> 01:46:40,085
I have to ask myself,

1759
01:46:41,600 --> 01:46:43,648
what would a bad man do?

1760
01:46:48,960 --> 01:46:51,884
I appreciate you leaving my name
out of your testimony.

1761
01:46:52,920 --> 01:46:55,048
I didn't really see
a reason to include it.

1762
01:46:55,240 --> 01:46:56,765
Yeah, but still.

1763
01:46:59,120 --> 01:47:00,531
Can I ask you a question?

1764
01:47:01,240 --> 01:47:02,321
Sure.

1765
01:47:05,880 --> 01:47:08,486
When we met in Vegas
at the blackjack table,

1766
01:47:09,240 --> 01:47:10,605
was that a coincidence?

1767
01:47:12,520 --> 01:47:14,249
What do you think?

1768
01:47:19,800 --> 01:47:21,484
Can I ask you another question?

1769
01:47:23,280 --> 01:47:25,965
My driver in Albania went missing.

1770
01:47:27,320 --> 01:47:29,288
Do you know what happened to him?

1771
01:47:43,840 --> 01:47:46,764
It's a piece of my end on the Afghan deal.

1772
01:47:51,520 --> 01:47:52,931
It's for you.

1773
01:48:07,800 --> 01:48:09,768
No more questions.
