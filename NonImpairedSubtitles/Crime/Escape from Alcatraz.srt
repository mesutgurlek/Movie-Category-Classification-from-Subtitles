If you disobey the rules of society,

If you disobey the rules of the prison,
they send you to us.

Alcatraz is not like any other prison
in the United States.

41
00:13:46,326 --> 00:13:51,163
Here, every inmate is confined alone

42

to an individual cell.

Unlike my predecessors,
Wardens Johnston and Blackwell,

I don't have good conduct
programmes or inmate councils.

Inmates here have no say in what
they do. They do as they're told.

Privileges...
You can talk. You can work.

54
00:14:44,301 --> 00:14:48,471
Other institutions hand out work,
but here it's a privilege you must earn.

00:14:48,972 --> 00:14:52,141
I promise you,
it's a privilege that you'll want.

Alcatraz was built to keep
all the rotten eggs in one basket.

70
00:15:51,201 --> 00:15:55,746
I was chosen to make sure that the
stink from the basket doesn't escape.

71
00:15:57,165 --> 00:16:01,460
A few people have tried to escape.
Most of them have been recaptured.

72
00:16:01,545 --> 00:16:06,215
Those that haven't have been killed
or drowned in the bay.

73
00:16:07,050 --> 00:16:09,677
No one has ever
escaped from Alcatraz.

I was in this bar in Alabama,
when two dudes started hassling me.

That was their first mistake.

109

They pulled knives.
That was their second mistake.

110
00:21:02,637 --> 00:21:07,099
They didn't know how to use them. That
was the last mistake they ever made.

could have pleaded self-defence.

in one of those dark cells in D block.

I wouldn't turn my back on you.

- What kind of childhood did you have?
- Short.

317
00:49:37,016 --> 00:49:39,101
CHARLEY: I always wanted
to see San Francisco.

318
00:49:39,185 --> 00:49:41,895
I never thought it would be like this.

319
00:49:42,021 --> 00:49:44,690
What did you get sent to the Rock for?

320
00:49:46,442 --> 00:49:49,111
A couple of years ago,
I started stealing cars.

321
00:49:49,237 --> 00:49:54,032
Sometimes I'd strip them and sell
the parts. Got sent to the State Pen.

322
00:49:54,951 --> 00:49:58,412
- Did you end up in Alcatraz for that?
- Hmm... Not exactly.

323
00:49:58,496 --> 00:50:03,917
There was a bull there that pushed me
around, so when I got out I stole his car.

324
00:50:05,295 --> 00:50:09,381
Unfortunately, I drove across the
state line, which made it a federal rap.

325
00:50:09,507 --> 00:50:12,593
The bull saw to it
that I was sent to the Rock.

326
00:50:15,889 --> 00:50:18,765
GUARD: English! Visitor for you.

327
00:50:22,353 --> 00:50:24,688
Butts. You've got a visitor.

328
00:50:25,440 --> 00:50:27,482
- Me?
- Yeah, you.

329
00:50:27,817 --> 00:50:30,694
Probably somebody
who wants their car back.

330
00:50:53,384 --> 00:50:54,801
Hello, father.

331
00:51:00,892 --> 00:51:02,809
Why didn't you tell me
you were coming?

332
00:51:04,312 --> 00:51:06,355
I was afraid you wouldn't let me.

333
00:51:08,066 --> 00:51:10,442
It's just hard to see you like this.

334
00:51:15,990 --> 00:51:17,699
Your momma's going to die.

335
00:51:28,294 --> 00:51:29,586
Charley...

336
00:51:33,049 --> 00:51:37,761
- When?
- Well, she's got a few months.

337
00:51:39,555 --> 00:51:45,686
- Can you call her?
- We can't make any phone calls.

338

the prison. Stick to your personal life.

339
00:51:50,400 --> 00:51:52,985

Do you get a kick out of it?

340

341
00:51:54,904 --> 00:51:58,031

342
00:52:01,703 --> 00:52:07,708
I love you, Charley.

343
00:52:34,652 --> 00:52:38,572
- (WHISPERING) Frank?
- Yeah.

344
00:52:39,532 --> 00:52:42,242
If you ever try to get out of here,
I want in.

345
00:52:59,302 --> 00:53:02,262
- Must be Wednesday.
- Why?

346
00:53:03,348 --> 00:53:07,684
Mystery mounds. We always have
mystery mounds on Wednesday.

347
00:53:08,436 --> 00:53:11,521
I can't taste it. I just eat out of habit.

348
00:53:15,985 --> 00:53:17,652
What's the movie this weekend?

349
00:53:17,737 --> 00:53:19,654
JOHN: Some cowboy piece of shit.

350
00:53:20,990 --> 00:53:24,159
(IN MACHO VOICE) Hey! At least they
could show us a gangster movie.

351
00:53:25,161 --> 00:53:26,244
(LAUGHS)

352
00:53:29,624 --> 00:53:32,334
I may have found a way out of here.

353
00:53:38,341 --> 00:53:40,133
You looking at something?

354
00:53:46,641 --> 00:53:50,227
The way I figure it,
this cell block is really getting old.

355
00:53:51,312 --> 00:53:56,024
The moist air is corroding the concrete,
and the salt is rusting the metal.

356
00:53:57,068 --> 00:54:01,279
I took a nail clipper. I dug around
the grille in the back of the cell.

357
00:54:02,156 --> 00:54:05,659
With some work I can dig that grille
out of there, enlarge the hole

358
00:54:05,785 --> 00:54:11,123
and get into the utility corridor,
that might lead to the roof.

359
00:54:11,624 --> 00:54:14,584
How will we hide the hole
while we're working on it?

360
00:54:15,586 --> 00:54:20,465
We can tear the ads out of magazines
and make cardboard out of them.

361
00:54:20,591 --> 00:54:23,176
Paint grilles on that
and put it back in the hole.

362
00:54:23,302 --> 00:54:27,639
Maybe partially obscure it with a towel
or a bathrobe or whatever.

363
00:54:27,723 --> 00:54:31,726
I've ordered an accordion, which I'm
going to put in front of my hole.

364
00:54:31,811 --> 00:54:36,815
If we get out of the cell house, they'll
know we're gone at the next count.

365
00:54:37,400 --> 00:54:41,361
We'll leave at night. That way,
they won't know 'til the morning.

366
00:54:41,529 --> 00:54:46,575
We have to make dummy heads
out of plaster, cardboard or whatever.

367
00:54:47,827 --> 00:54:51,079
Put them in the bunks,
and the guards won't know.

368
00:54:51,622 --> 00:54:54,583
You work in the barber shop.

- MORRIS: You work in the clothing shop.

370
00:55:01,257 --> 00:55:04,885
You're going to steal some raincoats
and some contact cement.

371
00:55:05,720 --> 00:55:10,557

I read about it in Popular Mechanics.

372
00:55:11,392 --> 00:55:13,894
They're going to think we go to Frisco.

373
00:55:14,228 --> 00:55:16,688
We won't.
We'll go to Angel Island instead.

374
00:55:19,567 --> 00:55:20,609
What about me?

375
00:55:23,237 --> 00:55:26,490
You'll stand guard while I dig.
I'll stand guard while you dig.

it's been sticking in someone's ass.

390
00:57:50,051 --> 00:57:52,385
And I want to ask about
working in the kitchen.

391
00:57:56,349 --> 00:57:58,516
- Go ahead.
- Thank you.

392
00:58:06,651 --> 00:58:10,570
- I want to join the kitchen detail.
- Can you cook?

393
00:58:10,696 --> 00:58:14,991
- Can I turn this spoon in for another?
- You're goddamn right, I can cook!

394
00:58:15,326 --> 00:58:20,789
I used to be a cook in a cafe in Georgia.
Everybody loved my meatballs.

- Did you quit or get fired?

I'm just starting the dummy.

might as well start hauling them up.

Seems to be a metal hood
riveted onto iron uprights.

There's an electrical outlet here.
