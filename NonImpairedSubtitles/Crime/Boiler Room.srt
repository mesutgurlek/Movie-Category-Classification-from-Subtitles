1
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:55,791  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
I read this article
a while back...

2
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:58,639  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
that said Microsoft employs more
millionaire secretaries...

3
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:01,035  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
than any other company
in the world.

4
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:04,277  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
They took stock options
Over Christmas bonuses.

5
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:06,470  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
It was a good move.

6
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:08,909  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
I remember there was this photograph
Of one of the groundskeepers...

7
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:11,110  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
next to his Ferrari.

8
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:13,117  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Biew my mind.

9
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:16,073  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
You see shit I ike that,
And it just paints seeds...

10
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:18,555  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
makes you think it's possible,
even easy.

11
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:21,638  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
And then you turn on the TV,
And there's just more of it.

12
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:24,115  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
The $87 million dollar
Lottery winner.

13
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:27,198  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
That kid actor that just made
20miIIion on his last movie.

14
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:29,675  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
That Internet stock that
shot through the roof.

15
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:32,758  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
You could've made millions on it
If you'd just got in early.

16
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:36,793  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
And that's exactly
what I wanted to do.: get in.

17
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:41,038  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
I didn't want to be an innovator. I just
wanted to make the quick, easy buck.

18
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:43,355  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
I just wanted in.

19
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:46,670  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Notorious B.I. G.
said it best.:

20
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:49,997  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
''Either you're singing crack rock,
or you got a wicked jump shot. ''

21
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:52,350  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Nobody wants to work
For it anymore.

22
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:55,916  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
There's no honour in taking
that after-school job at MickeyD's.

23
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:58,713  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Honour's in the dollar, kid.

24
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:01,718  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
So I went the white-boy way
Of slinging crack rock.

25
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:03,398  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
I became a stockbroker.

26
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:13,277  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
- Get off!
- Two hundred!

27
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:16,073  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Put your money back down!
Yo! Put your money back down!

28
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:39,597  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
So I got in at this firm,
J. T. Marlin...

29
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:42,473  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
owned by
this guy Michael Brantley...

30
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:44,750  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
a salesman among salesmen.

31
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:47,633  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Mr Brantley!

32
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:51,309  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
- Mr Brantley! Welcome! How are you?
- How you gonna handle these guys?

33
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:53,795  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
- They're great.
- You think you can handle this or what?

34
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:56,673  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
- l think so. We can handle it.
- You can handle it?

35
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:05,637  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
A double scotch on the rocks.

36
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:16,397  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Holy shit, yo.
Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo!

37
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:19,592  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
That's the jockey from Venezuela.
He's a sicko. He weighs like 48 pounds.

38
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:22,314  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
1 1 9, but you're close, slut.

39
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:24,476  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Whatever. Give me three-to-one
on that skinny little nigger.

40
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:28,593  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Richie, Richie.
Do me a favour, will you?

41
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:30,995  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Just for, like, ten minutes.
Just give it a rest.

42
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:35,238  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Yo, homes, l need some ''chocaine.''
l need some motherfuckin' nose candy.

43
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:37,271  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
l need some cizzi up my nizzi...

44
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:39,277  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
'cause l need to get high
like a motherfucker.

45
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:42,278  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Know what I'm sayin'?
So give me some of that nose candy.

46
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:44,550  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Bring that table over here.

47
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:48,719  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Everybody quiet down for a second.
All right. Hold on.

48
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:53,789  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Thanks. l wanted to let you know those
pikers at the N.A.S.D. are of four ass.

49
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:00,598  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
- Fuckin' retard.
- Fuck you. I'm on vacation.

50
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:04,156  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Bear Stearns can call the S.E.C.
They can't find any dirt on us.

51
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:07,511  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
J.T. Marlin, once again,
has unlimited trading authorization.

52
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:10,234  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
l told you guys.
You can't keep a good man down!

53
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:13,319  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
We're superstars now.

54
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:16,238  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
J.P. Morgan just faxed over
their congratulations...

55
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:18,237  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
and said,
''Welcome to the club.''

56
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:22,913  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
This also means those teams
headed by Todd and Richie...

57
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:25,270  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
who were good enough
to give up their rep numbers--

58
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:27,914  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
They can stop cold calling
and start trading again.

59
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:29,996  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Welcome back!

60
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:31,951  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
And just to show you
how appreciative l am...

61
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:33,229  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
there's a little something extra.

62
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:35,920  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Tell me about it, baby, tell me!

63
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:38,600  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
l want you guys
to go up to suite 41 8.

64
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:43,476  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
l handpicked them myself.

65
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:48,198  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
We're players now, boys!
Let's celebrate. Salute!

66
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:17,478  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Don't touch the cards.
Don't touch the cards.

67
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:28,831  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
- Fourteen.
- Hit me.

68
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:31,269  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Come on, Mike. l told you you
gotta hit the table. Sixteen.

69
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:33,630  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Hit me.

70
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:36,194  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
And bust.
Sorry about that.

71
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:39,153  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Fuck! Can't
win a fuckin' hand tonight!

72
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:41,874  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Hey, Steve?
Come here for a second.

73
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,638  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
You thirsty?
l don't care.

74
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:46,354  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Go take my car and get Mike a Coke
and a falafel. You hungry?

75
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:49,517  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Yeah. Yeah.
Sure. Why not?

76
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:51,471  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
- And dealer busts.
- Yeah!

77
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:53,477  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
What the fuck are
you so happy about?

78
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:55,591  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Whoa, take it easy.

79
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:57,790  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Roller coaster.
Ups and downs. You know that.

80
00:06:57,920 --> 00:07:00,798  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
All right. Place your bets.

81
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:04,275  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
I was Living in Kew Gardens Hills,
running mybiz...

82
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:07,472  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
giving the Queens College kids
something to do between classes.

83
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:09,989  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
- See you guys.
- Fuck you.

84
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:13,271  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
- Okay. I'll see you tomorrow.
- I was doing well.

85
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:26,353  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
It's strange to think how
that knock changed everything.

86
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:29,836  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Everything.
Hey, don't get me wrong here.

87
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:31,359  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
No, no. l got it.

88
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:34,870  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
I don't believe in fate.
I believe in odds.

89
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:36,916  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
- He's not gonna let you in.
- Why not?

90
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:38,837  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
'Cause he doesn't know who you are.
He'll think you're a cop.

91
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:42,475  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
So what? l got a bankroll
that'll choke a hippo. Let's just see.

92
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:45,034  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
- Who are you?
- What's up?

93
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:49,597  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
- it's my boy, Greg. Oh, shit!

94

What's goin' on? Come here, crazy.
What are you doin'?

95
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:54,993  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
How're you doin'?
Come in. Come in.

96
00:07:56,480 --> 00:08:00,155  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Oh, shit. Wait.

97
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:02,919  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
- Him.
- Nice.

98
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:04,871  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
- Hi. Seth.
- Hey. Greg.

99
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,228  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Nice to meet you.

100
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:09,352  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
- We thought we were done for the night.
- Too late to get a couple hands in?

101
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:11,357  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
No, no, no. 24-7.

102
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:15,797  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Hey, Steve, could you get us
a couple of sandwiches?

103
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:20,358  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
- All right. Give me 400.
- Wait. What about the betting?

104
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:24,439  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
- What were you thinking?
- Five hundred, max?

105
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:28,469  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
We don't usually
service that level of action...

106
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:30,636  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
but l hate
to turn away a new customer.

107
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:33,672  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
We might not have enough cash
to settle you at the end of the night.

108
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:36,633  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
That's okay.
You can just pay me tomorrow.

109
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:39,069  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
All right.
How much you want?

110
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:42,636  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
- Five dimes.
-Jeff.

111
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:43,909  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
You had to do it, didn't you?

112
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:45,598  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
You make me look
like I'm at the kiddie table.

113
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:48,632  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
- lf the shoe fits, kid. Come on.
- Fuckin' rich man.

114
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:50,955  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
- What denomination?
- What denomination?

115
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:54,595  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
How about three Puerto Ricans,
two Chinks and a Guinea?

116
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:56,597  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
l don't care. Mix it up.
Whatever you want.

117
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:58,756  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
What about a Swahili? Jesus.

118
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:01,348  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
l don't know what that is either.
You're starting to upset me.

119
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:03,471  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
You got your own chips, huh,
with your name on them?

120
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:05,352  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
This is no joke.

121
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:09,792  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
We used to use the
Bicycle poker chips...

122
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:11,751  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
and then some kid started
sneaking in additional funds.

123
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:14,792  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
- Who's that? Moyshe?
- No, no. Some kid up the block.

124
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:16,672  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Fuckin' Moyshe.

125
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:21,913  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
- So that's a nice car you have there.
- Thanks. A Ferrari.

126
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:25,112  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Yeah. it's a 355,
six-speed transmission, right?

127
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:28,755  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Yeah. it's a synchromesh.
l love it. Nice.

128
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:31,838  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Yo, shit is yellow, B.
Rizzy's the colour, nugga.

129
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:34,036  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Yellow's filthy. Come on.

130
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:36,515  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
it's Big Bird mode.

131
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:39,359  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
All right.
Place your bets.

132
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:52,236  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
- Hey.
- You are late.

133
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:56,114  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
- l know. I'm sorry.
- Your father is really upset.

134
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:59,357  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
- He won't even tell me what it is.
-Jesus.

135
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:05,714  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
- Hey.
- What's up, Seth?

136
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:08,229  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
- How you doin'? How's school?
- it's all right.

137
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:10,715  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
That's a good question, Seth.
You wanna tell us what happened?

138
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:15,391  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
- We didn't know if you were comin'.
- Oh, yeah. Traffic was crazy.

139
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:17,078  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
So?

140
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:21,034  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Do you wanna wait till after
dinner to talk about it?

141
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:23,276  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Yeah, let's eat first.

142
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:28,269  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
- Answer the question, Seth.
- l dropped out.

143
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:30,516  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
You wanna tell us why?

144
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:35,350  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Well, l gave it a year, Dad,
and it's just not for me.

145
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:38,472  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
l see. So that means you've been
lying to us for six months.

146
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:39,749  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Six months, Seth.

147
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:43,236  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
''School's fine, Dad.
My grades are good, Dad.''

148
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:47,114  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Let's just leave that for a second.
So you dropped out.

149
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:50,277  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
That means you haven't been getting
your student loan cheques, right?

150
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:53,790  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
ls that right? How are you making
the rent every month, Seth?

151
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:59,230  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
I'm running a business,
and I'm just earning a living.

152
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:03,876  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Earning a living? This what
you call earning a living?

153
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,877  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
- Marty, are those drugs?
- Yes.

154
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:09,794  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
- Yes, those are drugs?
- No, Mom. This is an honest living.

155
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:12,514  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
And you can ask any one
of my customers.

156
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:14,835  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
What do you mean, ''customers''?
Where's the customers?

157
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:16,712  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
They're children of people
in this community.

158
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:20,389  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
How do you think l got these?
Anyway, it's illegal.

159
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:25,310  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
You're running a backdoor card game!
How do you think this reflects on me?

160
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:29,035  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
I'm a judge,
for Christ's sake!

161
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:33,073  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Are you listening to me?

162
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:37,996  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
I'm gonna be honest with you.
You're runnin' a good business.

163
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:40,873  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
l think you're a smart kid,
pullin' in some real cash.

164
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,356  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
But l gotta tell you, man,
this is risky fuckin' business.

165
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:47,597  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
l mean, you really honestly plan
on dealing cards to college kids...

166
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:49,676  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
when you're fuckin' 35?

167
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:52,837  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
You don't think you'll get pinched
in the next couple years?

168
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:57,476  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Maybe it's time to start thinkin'
about down-the-line time.

169
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:01,913  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
So, you want me
to come work for you?

170
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:06,033  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
What? l guess it'll be like retribution
for me taking all your money here?

171
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:08,993  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
First of all, l am not
done with you here, all right?

172
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:11,031  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
And, no, you're only gonna
work for me a short time.

173
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:12,912  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
You pass the Series Seven.

174
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:16,316  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
You learn the ropes.
You're on your own.

175
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:19,512  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Yeah, ask Adam, man.
He'll tell you.

176
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:21,676  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
- it's good.
- it's good?

177
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:24,712  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
- Yeah.
- I'm gonna be blunt.

178
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:28,276  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
We're talkin' about
millions of dollars.

179
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:11,271  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
I was making
good money with the casino...

180
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:13,516  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
but these guys
were macking it hard.

181
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:16,154  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
That's the level
I wanted to be operating on.

182
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:19,636  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
So I drove out
to Long Island, way out.

183
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:23,594  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
The office was a good hour
away from Wall Street.

184
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:25,517  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Somebody forgot to tell the guys
who worked there, though.

185
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:27,198  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
They looked and acted...

186
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:30,073  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Like they took the Six train
to Fulton Street every morning.

187
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:31,599  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
But it wasn't Wall Street.

188
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:34,188  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
It was exit 53
on the Long Is land Expressway...

189
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:37,551  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
a good hour from
the New York Stock Exchange.

190
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:53,031  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
No, no, no, no. You don't wanna act now.
This stock is going to turn.

191
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:55,594  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
I'm invested very heavily myself.
We just stay put.

192
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:57,870  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
l don't know if you've ever had the
opportunity to purchase I.P.O. before...

193
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,070  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
but we have this company that's going
to market in about a week or so.

194
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:02,714  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
We're gonna have to move on this now.
This is gonna happen next week.

195
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:05,035  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
We don't wanna marry this stock.
We're in; we're out.

196
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:07,879  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
What do you mean, you don't buy stock
over the phone? How do you do it?

197
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,913  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Smoke signals? Telepathy? World leaders
solve problems over the phone.

198
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:16,716  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
I'm not a Charles Schwab.
l don't need your business; l value it.

199
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:20,116  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
I'm successful to the point where
l don't need to chase your business.

200
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:23,789  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Hey, kid, get the fuck
outta here!

201
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:34,153  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Over here.

202
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:38,829  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
- Have they started interviewing yet?
- No.

203
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:43,317  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
- Know how long it's gonna be?
- You'll all be going in together.

204
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:45,749  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
But l thought
this was, like, an interview?

205
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:49,270  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
it is. it's a group interview.
You'll see.

206
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:03,638  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
No, man.
You're a male.

207
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:07,669  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Group interview, my ass.

208
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:10,268  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
It was like a Hitler Youth rally,
in retrospect.

209
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:12,834  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
The guy who pitched us, Jim Young,
was the head recruiter there.

210
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:17,112  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
- Okay, guys. Let's go.
- Between him and Michael, honestly...

211
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:20,915  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
they could sell bubblegum
in the lockjaw ward at Bellevue.

212
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:33,749  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
I'm sorry, man.
This is my seat.

213
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:36,838  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
- Oh, shit. I'm so sorry.
- it's okay. Don't worry about it.

214
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:43,039  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
- Fuckin' dumb-ass.
- Get the fuck outta here.

215
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:46,469  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
- What?
- Don't talk to me. Don't look at me.

216
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:50,309  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Just get your ass out of that ltalian
leather chair and get the fuck out.

217
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:53,955  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Right now. Come on.
Let's go, schlepp rock.

218
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:55,718  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Out.

219
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:00,311  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Sit down.

220
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:03,238  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
We expect everyone here to
treat their co-workers...

221
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:05,271  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
with a certain level
of respect.

222
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:10,190  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Before we start, l have one question.
Has anyone passed a Series Seven exam?

223
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:13,756  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
- l have a Series Seven licence.
- Good for you. You can get out too.

224
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:15,791  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
What? Why?

225
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:18,593  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
We don't hire brokers here.
We train new ones.

226
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:22,713  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
That's it, Skippy.
Pack your shit. Let's go.

227
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:29,029  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Okay. Here's the deal.

228
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:32,709  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
I'm not here to waste your time.
l hope you're not here to waste mine.

229
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:34,637  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
So I'm gonna keep this short.

230
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:36,591  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
lf you become an employee
of this firm...

231
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:39,154  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
you will make your first million
within three years.

232
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:40,759  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Okay? l repeat that:

233
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:44,509  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
You will make a million dollars
within three years...

234
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:48,519  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
of your first day of employment
at J.T. Marlin.

235
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:51,632  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
There is no question whether or not
you'll become a millionaire here.

236
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:54,479  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
The only question
is how many times over.

237
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:57,956  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
You think I'm joking?
l am not joking.

238
00:16:58,080 --> 00:17:01,675  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
l am a millionaire.
it's a weird thing to hear, right?

239
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:04,360  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
I'll tell ya.
it's a weird thing to say.

240
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:06,516  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
l am a fucking millionaire.

241
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:09,552  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
And guess how old l am.
Twenty-seven.

242
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:13,355  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
You know what that makes me here?
A fuckin' senior citizen.

243
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:16,870  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
This firm is entirely comprised
of people your age, not mine.

244
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:20,709  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Lucky for me, I'm very fucking good
at my job, or I'd be out of one.

245
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:23,673  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
You guys are the new blood.
You're gonna go home with the kessef.

246
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:26,991  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
You are the future big swinging dicks
of this firm.

247
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:30,908  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Now, you all look money hungry,
and that's good.

248
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:34,715  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Anybody tells you money is the root
ofall evil doesn't fuckin' have any.

249
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:38,196  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
They say money can't buy happiness?
Look at the fuckin' smile on my face.

250
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:41,710  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Ear to ear, baby.
You want details? Fine.

251
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:44,308  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
l drive a Ferrari
355 Cabriolet.

252
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:49,230  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
What's up? l have a ridiculous house
in the South Fork.

253
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:52,750  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
l have every toy you could imagine,
and best of all, kids...

254
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:54,677  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
l am liquid.

255
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:58,998  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
So, now you know what's possible.
Let me tell you what's required.

256
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:03,318  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
You are required to work
your fucking ass off at this firm.

257
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:07,956  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
We want winners here, not pikers.
A piker walks at the bell.

258
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:12,278  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
A piker asks how much vacation you get
in the first year. Vacation?

259
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:15,551  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
People come and work at this firm
for one reason: to become filthy rich.

260
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:19,878  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
We're not here to make friends.
We're not savin' the manatees, guys.

261
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:23,072  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
You want vacation time?
Go teach third grade, public school.

262
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:32,599  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Okay. The first three months
at the firm are as a trainee.

263
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:33,835  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
You make $1 50 a week.

264
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:36,952  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
After you're done training,
you take the Series Seven.

265
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:38,433  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Pass that, you become junior broker...

266
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:40,073  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
and you open accounts
for your team leader.

267
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:43,715  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
You open 40 accounts, you start
workin' for yourself. Sky's the limit.

268
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:45,159  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Word about being a trainee.

269
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:48,352  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Friends, parents, other brokers,
they're gonna give you shit.

270
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:51,517  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
it's true. $1 50 a week?
Not a lot of money.

271
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:52,436  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Pay them no mind.

272
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:55,711  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
You need to learn this business,
and this is the time to do it.

273
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:58,513  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Once you pass the test,
none of that's gonna matter.

274
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:00,551  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Your friends are shit.

275
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:03,148  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Tell them you made 25 grand last month,
they're won't fucking believe you.

276
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:05,510  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Fuck them! Fuck 'em!

277
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:09,076  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Parents don't like the life you lead?
''Fuck you, Mom and Dad.''

278
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:13,398  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
See how it feels when you're makin'
their fuckin' Lexus payments.

279
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:16,910  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Now, go home and think about it.
Think about whether it's really for you.

280
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:20,316  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
lf you decide it isn't--
lt's nothing to be embarrassed about.

281
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:24,319  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
lt's not for everyone.
Thanks.

282
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:27,432  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
But if you
really want this...

283
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:30,836  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
you call me on Monday
and we'll talk.

284
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:34,350  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Just don't
waste my fuckin' time.

285
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:36,516  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Okay. That's it.

286
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:23,111  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
- Hi.
- Hi.

287
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:26,198  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
So, what's up?

288
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:30,711  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
- How you doin'?
- I'm fine, Seth. What's on your mind?

289
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:35,960  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
l feel bad about the way things went
at the house last week.

290
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:40,709  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
l just don't feel like we get
anywhere when we talk at home.

291
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:44,435  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Well, l don't know
that there's anything to talk about.

292
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:48,269  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
- Can l get you anything to drink?
- No. I'm fine, thanks.

293
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:50,994  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
You dropped out
of school, Seth.

294
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:54,157  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
You're running an illegal casino
out of your apartment.

295
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:57,795  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
You're putting my career at risk.
What is there to talk about, Seth?

296
00:20:57,920 --> 00:21:02,516  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Well, l don't know why
we can't just discuss this. l mean--

297
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:04,551  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Maybe you're just not
seeing my side.

298
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:07,877  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Your side? What side?
You're doing wrong.

299
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,036  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
I'm not your best friend.
That's your mother's racket.

300
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:12,469  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
I'm your father.
l tell you when you screw up.

301
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:15,319  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
What did you think l was gonna do?
Pat you on the back for the casino idea?

302
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:17,829  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Tell you what
a great entrepreneur you are?

303
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:21,190  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
So what do you want me
to do, Seth?

304
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:24,869  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
l mean, my God, if I'd called my father
to meet me for a cup of coffee...

305
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,833  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
to talk about my screw ups,
he probably would've laughed.

306
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:30,474  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
We didn't have nice little chats
about why l was a bad boy.

307
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:32,318  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
l got smacked.

308
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:35,079  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
And l didn't do it again.
Much simpler.

309
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:38,397  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Look. I'm just trying to restore
what's left of our relationship.

310
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:40,476  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
''Relationship''?

311
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:43,672  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
What the fuck are you
talking about, relationship?

312
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:46,030  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
What? Are we dating?

313
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:48,151  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
I'm not your girlfriend Seth;
I'm your father.

314
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:50,430  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Clean up your life,
make an honest living...

315
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:54,075  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
and then you and l can talk
like normal people, all right?

316
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:23,358  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
- Hey, Seth.
- Hi. How you doin'?

317
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:27,553  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
- Abby.
- Oh, yeah. l know. l forgot.

318
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:29,796  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
it's okay. l never told you.

319
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:32,115  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Besides, the other day
you looked a little frazzled...

320
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:35,312  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
so l didn't think
you'd remember anyway.

321
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:39,274  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
- Today's my first day.
- No shit?

322
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:41,994  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Yeah.

323
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:44,315  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
- See ya.
- See ya.

324
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:52,118  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
No, that's not how it works.

325
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:55,277  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
lf l was asking you to
own 5,000 or 1 0,000 shares...

326
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:58,312  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
of some pink-sheet, bullshit company
with negative earnings...

327
00:22:58,440 --> 00:23:00,112  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
I'd tell you
to hang up the phone...

328
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:02,913  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
call your local broker
and short the stock.

329
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:07,591  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
l wouldn't expect your business.
But, Don, l am bringing you--

330
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:12,077  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Seth. Seth. Come over here.
it's not your table.

331
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:15,397  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
...F.D.A. landmark approval.
it's, like, the cancer pill.

332
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:20,548  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
No. lt's a cancer pill.
No, Don, it's not Propecia P.

333
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:24,150  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
it is the cancer pill.
Oh, Donald, please take a chance.

334
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:26,271  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
You look pretty.

335
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:28,595  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Thankyou.

336
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:31,712  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
So you wanna tell me where the fuck
you were last night?

337
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:34,957  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
- Not particularly.
- Okay.

338
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:42,629  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
This is for you.

339
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:47,993  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
l don't know how to better
explain this to you, but...

340
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:51,711  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
it's over.

341
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:54,559  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Okay. l disagree.

342
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:58,880  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
- Hang on a second.
- Here you go.

343
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:04,589  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
- What's up? ls he in?
- l don't know.

344
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:11,673  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Hey. These are the D&B cards.
These are our leads.

345
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:14,917  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
- Morning.
- Every card is an opportunity, right?

346
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:18,237  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
These are good leads.
People on these cards buy stock.

347
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:20,510  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Your job is to call them
and get them interested in the firm.

348
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:23,234  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
You're not actually selling stock yet,
but you're selling the dream.

349
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:25,157  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
So get'em wet. Tell'em
that in a month from now...

350
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:28,636  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
a senior broker's gonna
call them back with an idea.

351
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:30,159  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
So who are these people?

352
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:32,475  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Average client's 45 years old,
from the Midwest...

353
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:36,149  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
$1 50,000 annual income,
1 million net, has a local broker...

354
00:24:36,280 --> 00:24:39,238  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
but loves a hotshot New Yorker
who sounds good on the phone.

355
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:42,591  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
So the card won't tell you that. lt only
has name, address and occupation.

356
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:46,076  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
So you gotta
feel'em out, see?

357
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:49,351  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
''Peter Davis, Vice President,
Parks Telecommunications.''

358
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:51,277  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
The guy's probably
a fuckin' whale.

359
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:54,915  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
So feel'im out, see what he's got.
Truth is, it doesn't matter these days.

360
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:57,918  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
With the Dow where it is now,
everybody wants a piece of the market.

361
00:24:58,040 --> 00:25:01,476  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
l can close anyone anytime anywhere.
Just give me a phone number.

362
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:04,160  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
- Greg, l have John Duncklee on three.
- Not now. I'll call him back.

363
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:06,874  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Now, once you qualify the guy,
you send him a press packet.

364
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:10,276  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
it'll be easy, and it'll get you
comfortable on the phone, which is key.

365
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:14,393  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
This entire business revolves
around the phone. Play the numbers.

366
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:17,796  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
This is a contact sport. The more people
you contact, the better you'll do.

367
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:22,357  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
- A good broker makes 700 calls a day.
- What's the phone bill like?

368
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:24,789  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
This month
was approaching 400,000.

369
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:27,593  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Listen to me. Even though
you're not selling stock yet...

370
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:30,917  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
l want you to remember the code
we have here, okay?

371
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:32,837  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
- Did you see Glengarry Glen Ross?
- Yeah.

372
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:35,918  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
- Do you remember ''ABC''?
- Yeah. ''Always be closing.''

373
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:38,474  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
That's right. ''Always be closing.''
''Telling's not selling.''

374
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:42,832  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
That's the attitude you wanna have.
There's two rules as a trainee.

375
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:45,713  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Number one:
We don't pitch the bitch here.

376
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:47,068  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
What?

377
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:49,430  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
We don't sell stock to women.
l don't care who it is; we don't do it.

378
00:25:49,560 --> 00:25:51,278  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Nancy Sinatra calls,
you tell her you're sorry.

379
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:52,879  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
They're a constant pain
in the ass...

380
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,877  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
and you're never
gonna hear the end of it.

381
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:57,349  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
They'll call you every fucking day
wanting to know why the stock dropped.

382
00:25:57,480 --> 00:25:59,118  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
And God forbid
the stock should go up.

383
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:01,117  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
You're gonna hear
from them every 1 5 minutes.

384
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:04,232  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
lt's just not worth it.
Don't pitch the bitch.

385
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:06,396  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Number two:
Don't write wood, all right?

386
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:09,034  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
A lot of trainees are so anxious
to get off the phone...

387
00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:11,435  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
that they just steamroll the guy
into getting the press packet...

388
00:26:11,560 --> 00:26:12,754  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
so they can hang up.

389
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:14,074  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Then l call back, and I'm, like...

390
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:16,236  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
''Hi. You spoke to a junior
associate of mine last month.''

391
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:19,113  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
And he's like, ''Not interested. Bye.''
That's a shitty lead, okay?

392
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:22,312  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
That's fucking wood.
The info we send is bullshit, all right?

393
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:26,149  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
The most important part is telling them
you have that one great idea...

394
00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:28,430  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
and that a senior broker's
gonna call them back in a month.

395
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:31,478  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
This way they don't think
We just fire off a million recos a day.

396
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:32,919  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
We don't want clients thinkin'...

397
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:34,917  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
you're pitching something
you read in the Journal, right?

398
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:36,917  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
- Yeah. Right.
- Okay, so no wood.

399
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:40,112  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
- l'm serious. No wood.
- All right. Take it easy.

400
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:44,870  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Hey, don't even start
that fuckin' shit with me, okay?

401
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,719  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
I'm tryin' to tell you what's expected
of you and what your job is.

402
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:51,753  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
I'm tryin' to make the job easier, okay?
Don't give me any fuckin' lip.

403
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:55,316  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Okay. Okay, so, fine.

404
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:59,069  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
What happens if the guy
wants to buy stock right then?

405
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:02,397  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Now you're talkin'. You wanna go
into every call expecting just that.

406
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:04,670  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
lf somebody wants a recommendation,
put the guy on hold...

407
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:07,439  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
stand up and yell ''reco''
at the top of your lungs.

408
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:10,393  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
First senior broker who gets
on the horn gets the sale.

409
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:12,636  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
- Sound good?
- Yeah.

410
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:17,515  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Okay. That suit's dog shit.
Get a new suit.

411
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:20,313  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
No, Ma. l told you.
No, I'm not a broker yet.

412
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:23,432  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
I'm a trainee. l still have
to pass my Series Seven test.

413
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:24,959  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Please.
You're a stockbroker.

414
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:27,514  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
You wear a suit to work
every day, don't you?

415
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:32,674  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
- Yeah.
- So, what are we arguing about?

416
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:35,360  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
- Thanks, Ma.
- You're doing great, Seth.

417
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:38,313  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
You're working your way up
from the bottom. Never easy.

418
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:40,158  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
What did Dad say about it?

419
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:43,670  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
He's very happy.
Shocked, but very happy.

420
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:47,156  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
- He's waiting for you to call him.
- Why doesn't he call me?

421
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:51,068  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
- One miracle at a time, okay, sweetie?
- All right.

422
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:55,475  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
- Mom?
- I'm in bed.

423
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:07,310  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
- How you doin'?
- Hi, baby. How was work?

424
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:11,035  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
l know you're not at home with a bag
of cash, waiting for me to call you.

425
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:13,628  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
But I'm not some 1 8-year old selling
the cure for AIDS. l am 46 years old.

426
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:17,355  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
l have 22 years of market experience.
l know this business.

427
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:20,313  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
So pick up your skirt, grab your balls
and let's make some money.

428
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:22,908  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Here you go, Greg.

429
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:26,350  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
l hope this is better
than the last batch of shit you gave me.

430
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:29,671  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
- Produced more wood than Ron Jeremy.
- What?

431
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:33,918  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Don't yell ''reco'' any more.
Know what you should yell? ''Timber!''

432
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:36,508  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Yeah. Mr Fuckin' Wood.
l hear you fuckin' makin' your calls.

433
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:38,471  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
lt's bullshit, all right?

434
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:41,194  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
lf you want them off the phone so bad,
why don't you just hang up?

435
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:43,276  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
You should get them excited.
You know, excited?

436
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:46,278  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
They should beg for a broker
on the first call. Shit.

437
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:50,871  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Yeah. Howard Young, please.
Seth Davis over at J.T. Marlin.

438
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:54,310  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
- No, he's not expecting my call.
- No. Tsk.

439
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:56,476  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
- Okay. Yeah. I'll call you.
- Goodbye. Goodbye.

440
00:28:56,600 --> 00:28:57,828  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Hang up the phone.

441
00:28:57,960 --> 00:29:00,394  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Thank you. That's nice
For you to do that for me.

442
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:03,478  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
First of all, there's gonna be a lot of
these regardless of how good you are...

443
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:06,194  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
but you happen to suck big,
fat-ass rhinoceros dick.

444
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:08,390  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Well, thank you.
That's confidence-inspiring.

445
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:10,511  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
l got this friend who runs this
other firm, right?

446
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:13,194  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
He hands out
this book to new trainees.

447
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:16,073  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
it's called a rebuttal book.
lt looks like a little Filofax.

448
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:18,794  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
it's got these index tabs,
but instead of having letters...

449
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:22,435  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
like ''A'' to ''B,'' ''G'' to ''H,''
it has different things like...

450
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:24,437  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
''My wife won't let me''...

451
00:29:24,560 --> 00:29:27,120  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
or ''I'm not in the market now''
or ''Send me a prospectus.''

452
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:29,037  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
it has a rebuttal
for any excuse.

453
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:31,037  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Anyway, that's stuff
you'll have to learn later.

454
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:33,720  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
The most important thing
you gotta know right now...

455
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:36,149  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
is that you can be whoever
you wanna be on the phone.

456
00:29:36,280 --> 00:29:39,909  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
You know what I'm sayin'? Who cares?
Do what you gotta do.

457
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:43,077  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Change your last name.
Say you're the fuckin' vice president.

458
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:46,192  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
You know? Who cares?
Just get the cocksucker on the line.

459
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:49,995  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Yeah, but how can l do shit like that?
isn't there a compliance officer here?

460
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:52,680  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
No. No, man. Everybody does that shit.
Are you kidding?

461
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:54,313  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
l mean, even on Wall Street.

462
00:29:54,440 --> 00:29:56,670  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
You talking about John there?
That guy works for us.

463
00:29:56,800 --> 00:29:59,519  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
The guy's a fuckin' chimp. Look at him.
The only compliance work...

464
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:02,757  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
he's doin' is makin' sure my lunch
is still hot when it gets here.

465
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:07,112  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
He's only here because the S.E.C.
requires it. Easiest job in the world.

466
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:10,391  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Look. l think he's actually
masturbating right now.

467
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:21,711  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
- Stay the fuck away from her.
- Yeah.

468
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:26,117  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Holy shit, you slut.
You made the call.

469
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:29,789  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
No, no. Don't you dare. Get your
filthy one-race paws off my money.

470
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:31,592  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
What'd you bet me?
A month's commission?

471
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:34,154  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
- Yeah, and yours too, kid.
- How do you get away with this?

472
00:30:34,280 --> 00:30:36,316  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
'Cause l'm a Jew,
and l have the mind of a champion.

473
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:37,668  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
See this?

474
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:41,998  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Here, kid.
Go get a tan and some Rogaine.

475
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:44,873  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
- Watch out for this.
- Fuckin' A.

476
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:48,276  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
The only bookie in New York
that delivers FedEx.

477
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:54,713  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
When are you gonna
take the test, Seth?

478
00:30:54,840 --> 00:30:57,957  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Well, you know, after
the training programme's over.

479
00:30:58,080 --> 00:31:00,469  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
They want you to get a good idea
of how things work there...

480
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:03,512  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
before you take the Series Seven,
but it's a great system.

481
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:05,870  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
- l'm really learning a lot.
- Are you gonna be rich, Seth?

482
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:09,151  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
- Oh, God willing.
- l hope so.

483
00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:12,078  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
How come I've
never heard of this firm?

484
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:14,760  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
l don't know.

485
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:16,518  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
it's a smaller firm, l guess.

486
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:19,154  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
There's a million others like it
you probably never heard of.

487
00:31:19,280 --> 00:31:22,317  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
The reason l ask is 'cause l would've
thought that you would've...

488
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:26,353  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
joined a firm like Goldman Sachs
or something of that stature.

489
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:29,313  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
- Marty, what are you starting for?
- What?

490
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:33,831  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
No, no. Ma, it's okay.
The reason is, Dad...

491
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:37,270  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
that the larger houses don't really like
to hire kids straight out of college...

492
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:40,198  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
you know, unless you went
to an lvy League school...

493
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:44,108  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
or you wanna do cash-flow analysis
for the next 1 5 years.

494
00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:48,113  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
They usually like you
to work...

495
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:52,074  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
outside their firm for a few years
to get a good sense of the marketplace.

496
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:56,637  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
But most all brokers usually start out
in little firms like J.T. Marlin.

497
00:31:58,120 --> 00:32:01,192  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
That's great. See? He answered
the question. That was easy.

498
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:08,833  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
So all you have to do
is close the casino, right?

499
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:14,838  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Marty,
we talked about this.

500
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:18,555  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
- What are you giving me looks for?
- Didn't we talk about this?

501
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:21,513  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
- What? l just--
- lt was a celebration.

502
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:26,668  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
You know what?
l gotta go meet somebody.

503
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:29,439  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
l love you, Ma.

504
00:32:29,560 --> 00:32:31,949  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
See ya.
See ya later.

505
00:32:32,040 --> 00:32:34,395  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Nice job, Marty.

506
00:32:41,080 --> 00:32:45,278  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Originally, I got in for the cash.
But getting my dad's respect--

507
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:47,197  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
That's what kept me there.

508
00:32:47,320 --> 00:32:51,438  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
So he took some parting shots from time
to time. Whatever. I didn't care.

509
00:32:51,560 --> 00:32:53,676  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Not really.

510
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:56,439  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Anyway, the point is,
I had to adapt to this new world.

511
00:32:56,560 --> 00:32:58,118  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
I didn't really know these guys.

512
00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:01,835  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
What I did know is that they had
All the money in the world...

513
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:04,633  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
and not a clue
what to do with it.

514
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:40,835  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Seth, what's up, man?

515
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:43,269  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
- Wait outside.
- Hey, man.

516
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:45,960  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Thought you weren't gonna make it, man.
Sit down. Grab a slice. Have a beer.

517
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:47,069  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
What's up?

518
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:49,111  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
You think he fucked
Hannah or Sheen fucked her?

519
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:51,356  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
- Both of'em.
- Did he just move in?

520
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:55,598  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
- He's been here eight months.
- Life all comes down to a few moments.

521
00:33:55,720 --> 00:33:59,599  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
''This is one of'em.''
Sheen was kind of a pimp.

522
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:02,473  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Shut up, man. Listen. Gecko's coming on.
''What the hell's goin' on?''

523
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:06,832  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
I'm lookin' at 200,000 shares moved.
l wanna know if we're part of it.

524
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:10,071  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
We'd better be, or I'm gonna come down
and eat your lunch. Back in two, Alex.

525
00:34:10,200 --> 00:34:14,079  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Look. l loved it at forty.
Fifty? it's an insult.

526
00:34:14,200 --> 00:34:16,714  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Their analysts? They don't know
a preferred stock from livestock.

527
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:19,752  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
They wait till it goes down,
and like gumdrops and sperm counts--

528
00:34:21,920 --> 00:34:26,152  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
This is the kid. Calls me 59 days
in a row. Wants to be a player.

529
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:29,750  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Ought a be a picture of you in the
dictionary under ''persistent,'' kid.

530
00:34:29,880 --> 00:34:32,952  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Yeah? Now, listen Jerry, I'm
looking for negative control.

531
00:34:33,080 --> 00:34:34,433  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
No more than 30, 35 percent.

532
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:37,028  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Just enough to block
anybody else's merger plans...

533
00:34:37,160 --> 00:34:39,355  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
and find out from the inside
if the books are cooked.

534
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:43,917  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Looks this good on paper, we're
in the kill zone, pal. Lock and load.

535
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:46,270  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Lunch? You gotta be kidding.
Lunch is for wimps.

536
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:49,358  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Okay, Fidel,
I'll talk at you.

537
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:51,436  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Very good.

538
00:34:51,560 --> 00:34:54,996  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
How do you do, Mr Gekko?
Bud Fox.

539
00:34:55,120 --> 00:34:58,237  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
So you say, ''Nice to meet you.''
Hope you're intelligent.

540
00:34:58,360 --> 00:35:00,316  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Where'd you get these?

541
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:03,432  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
- l got a connection at the airport.
- Nice job, Mr Clean.

542
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:06,074  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Hey. Get the fuck off me.

543
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:12,192  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
- I'm really busy, Seth.
- No. Look, l understand, Doctor.

544
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:13,673  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
I'm really busy here myself.

545
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:16,678  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
We're gonna come back to you
in one month with one idea only.

546
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:20,509  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
lf you like what we have to say, great.
We'll do business. lf not--

547
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:23,598  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
I mean, worst-case scenario, you'll hear
Your self a new business idea--

548
00:35:23,720 --> 00:35:27,349  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
- That X ray is useless.
- We'll part as friends, right?

549
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:28,071  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
What?

550
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:30,316  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Are you working with a million
dollars in the market now?

551
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:31,316  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Who is this?

552
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:35,115  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
You're a doctor. Have you heard
Of a drug called Phenodryl?

553
00:35:35,240 --> 00:35:37,356  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
It's being manufactured
by M.S. C. Pharmaceuticals.

554
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:38,435  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
No.

555
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:42,758  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Well, listen, okay? it's in the
third stage of F.D.A. approval.

556
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:45,633  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Word is it's gonna be approved
within the next three months...

557
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:47,591  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
and it could be tomorrow
for all I know.

558
00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:50,951  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
But, you know,
I'm getting ahead of myself...

559
00:35:51,080 --> 00:35:53,753  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
and you're real busy over there...

560
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:55,518  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
so why don't I just send you out
the information--

561
00:35:55,640 --> 00:35:58,757  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Wait, wait, wait.
Forget the info.

562
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:01,553  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Let's talk about this now.

563
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:03,079  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
What was the name
of that drug again?

564
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:05,760  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Could you hold on
for one second?

565
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:07,757  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
I'm gonna get...

566
00:36:07,880 --> 00:36:10,792  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
a senior broker who's a little more
familiar with that particular stock.

567
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:14,356  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
All right? Hold on a second.
One second.

568
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:19,509  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Reco!

569
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:32,636  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
- Got it.
- Sorry.

570
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:35,911  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
His name's Dr Jacobs,
and I'd say that he's definitely--

571
00:36:36,040 --> 00:36:38,076  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
- Whoa. l don't wanna hear it, kid.
- Okay.

572
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:42,877  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Hi, Dr Jacobs?
This is Chris Marlin at J.T. Marlin.

573
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:46,276  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
- Marlin?
- Right. He's my father.

574
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:48,516  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
My associate tells me you're interested
in one of our stocks.

575
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:51,074  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Your wife's on three.
I will call her back.

576
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:53,395  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Yes. M.S. C. sounds like
it might be interesting.

577
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:54,919  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Might be?

578
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:58,919  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
''Might be'' doesn't sell stock at the
rate M.S.C.'s going for it, Dr Jacobs.

579
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:01,508  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
- We're talking very high volume.
- I still have to run it by my people.

580
00:37:01,640 --> 00:37:05,110  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
That's great, Doc, if you wanna miss
yet another opportunity here...

581
00:37:05,240 --> 00:37:07,390  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
and watch your colleagues
get rich doing clinical trials.

582
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:10,478  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
- Don't buy a share and hang up.
- Holdon a second.

583
00:37:10,600 --> 00:37:14,070  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
- I just want to talk about it more.
- Honestly, l don't have the time.

584
00:37:14,200 --> 00:37:17,829  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
This stock is blowing up right now.
The whole firm's going nuts.

585
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:21,236  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Hold on. Let me open up
the door to my office.

586
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:25,393  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Oh, my God!

587
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:28,876  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
See that, Doc?
That's my trading floor.

588
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:32,754  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
l have calls to make to a million other
doctors who are already in the know.

589
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:36,509  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
l can't walk you through this right now.
l'm sorry.

590
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:44,551  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Okay, okay.
Let's do this.

591
00:37:44,680 --> 00:37:49,549  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Since you're a new account, l can't go
higher than 2,000 shares. l'm sorry.

592
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:55,277  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
2,000? Are you nuts? That is way
beyond what l was thinking. 2,000?

593
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:57,231  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Jesus!

594
00:37:59,240 --> 00:38:01,674  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Listen. I'm curious. Why can't you
sell me any more than that?

595
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:04,155  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Well, we like to establish a
relationship with our clients...

596
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:08,432  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
on something small before we get
to the more serious trades.

597
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:12,792  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Let me show you several
percentage points on this small trade...

598
00:38:12,920 --> 00:38:14,717  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
and then we'll talk
about doing future business.

599
00:38:14,840 --> 00:38:17,718  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
That sounds good.
Give me the 2,000 shares.

600
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:21,753  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
- Done.
- You sure you can't do better on this?

601
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:24,758  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
- I'm sorry, Dr Jacobs. l can't.
- All right.

602
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:27,075  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
- We'll start with this trade, then.
- Great. l promise...

603
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:29,111  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
we'll swing for the fences
on the next one.

604
00:38:29,240 --> 00:38:32,835  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Do you want that confirmation
sent to your office or your mansion?

605
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:35,918  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Very funny,
Mr MarIin.

606
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:39,316  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Let me put my secretary on,
and she'll take down your info.

607
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:42,477  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
it was a pleasure
doing business with you.

608
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:45,114  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Done and done.

609
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:51,352  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Yeah, baby!

610
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:56,674  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
- So, why'd you put a max on his buy?
- What?

611
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:59,109  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Why'd you put a max on his buy?

612
00:38:59,240 --> 00:39:00,958  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
You didn't tell him
how it works?

613
00:39:01,080 --> 00:39:04,709  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
He's a trainee. He doesn't need
to know initial sell limits.

614
00:39:04,840 --> 00:39:09,197  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Make sure he shows you the ropes, kid.
He's too busy callin' his bookie.

615
00:39:09,320 --> 00:39:12,357  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Fuckin' Hebrews. Always lookin' out
for themselves and never the trainees.

616
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:15,517  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
- Hey, hey.
- Why don't you go back to Little ltaly?

617
00:39:15,640 --> 00:39:19,792  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Go make me a latke, dreidel boy.
Abrams, look me up on the board.

618
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:23,549  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
The reason l capped him
is in case he's a piker.

619
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:25,591  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
See, we're gonna front the money
for this sale...

620
00:39:25,720 --> 00:39:28,757  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
and if he doesn't send the cheque,
l'm the one holding the bag, follow me?

621
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:29,676  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Right.

622
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:32,712  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Last commission month, the kid on Jim's
team wrote a million-dollar ticket.

623
00:39:32,840 --> 00:39:35,673  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Stock was down 3 1 /2 points
by settlement.

624
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:37,711  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Fuckin' kid took
a 1 /4 million-dollar hit.

625
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:39,995  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
- Shit.
- You know how much that hurts?

626
00:39:40,120 --> 00:39:43,351  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Besides, the first sell
just whets the appetite.

627
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:46,517  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
lf he's a whale--
which it looks like he is--

628
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:49,359  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
then I'll get him on a day
when there's a real rip.

629
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:50,833  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
What's a rip?

630
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:53,838  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
A commission.
That's why we work here.

631
00:39:53,960 --> 00:39:55,916  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
We make huge rips.

632
00:39:56,040 --> 00:39:59,271  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
No, l don't-- l still
don't know how it works.

633
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:01,038  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Okay.

634
00:40:01,160 --> 00:40:04,755  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
A two-dollar rip, which is unheard of
anywhere on Wall Street...

635
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:08,031  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
means that we're walkin' away...

636
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:12,233  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
with two dollars
for every share we sell.

637
00:40:12,360 --> 00:40:15,193  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Real money.
That's opportunity.

638
00:40:15,320 --> 00:40:17,788  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Jesus, Greg, you show him
where the bathroom is yet?

639
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:20,639  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Yeah, Seth, l showed you
where Chris's desk is, right?

640
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:24,309  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
- Richie, do something with this--
- How does Michael afford that?

641
00:40:26,080 --> 00:40:28,514  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
- Couldn't tell you.
- Okay.

642
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:31,234  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
lf he's doin' it, he's makin' money
on it. Point is:

643
00:40:31,360 --> 00:40:33,749  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Service your client right,
and he'll be back for more.

644
00:40:33,880 --> 00:40:36,348  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Show him a three-percent return...

645
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:38,630  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
and he'll trust you to
watch his kids for the weekend.

646
00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:52,237  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
- Abby.
- Hey, Seth.

647
00:40:52,360 --> 00:40:56,114  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
- Hi.
- You wanna go get yourself a drink?

648
00:40:56,240 --> 00:40:58,674  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Yeah.
You want anything?

649
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:01,268  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Oh. Okay.

650
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:11,758  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
l thought this was supposed to
be a big broker hangout.

651
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:16,078  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Merrill Lynch. Salomon Brothers.
Mad, big-dick Steve. What is this place?

652
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:19,237  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
This looks like the fucking
Christmas party at Mutual of Omaha.

653
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:22,352  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Yo, check this out.
Joe.

654
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:25,631  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Oh, my God. Would you
look at these monkeys?

655
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:29,150  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
So, who do you live with?

656
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:32,238  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
You mean, is the little black girl here
takin' care of her grandma...

657
00:41:32,360 --> 00:41:34,316  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
'cause her mama's
a crack head?

658
00:41:34,440 --> 00:41:36,954  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Yeah, exactly. l thought
it was smack, though.

659
00:41:37,080 --> 00:41:39,514  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Right.

660
00:41:41,160 --> 00:41:43,720  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Boy, you gotta get a hold
Of that edge. it's kind a sharp.

661
00:41:43,840 --> 00:41:47,515  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
l know. lt's just that
l get so much shit at J.T....

662
00:41:47,640 --> 00:41:50,359  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
that sometimes l have
to get in that modejust to...

663
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:52,869  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
fend them offof me, you know?

664
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:56,913  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Yeah, l was gonna ask you
why are you there...

665
00:41:57,040 --> 00:41:59,679  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
because it doesn't seem like the ideal
working environment for a black woman.

666
00:41:59,800 --> 00:42:01,916  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
No, it isn't. it's just that...

667
00:42:02,040 --> 00:42:04,793  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
how many secretaries do you know
that make 80 grand a year?

668
00:42:04,920 --> 00:42:07,559  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
- One.
- Exactly.

669
00:42:08,680 --> 00:42:12,389  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
- ''No, no, no. l gotta call the boss.''
- Look at this guy. Check it.

670
00:42:12,520 --> 00:42:14,988  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
No way.
Vito Corleone.

671
00:42:15,120 --> 00:42:16,678  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
You don't come all my life...

672
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:19,473  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
and then you show up
at my daughter's confirmation.

673
00:42:19,600 --> 00:42:22,319  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
''Are you standin' up or sittin' down?''
By that time l--

674
00:42:22,440 --> 00:42:25,955  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
- How you doin'?
- What's up?

675
00:42:26,080 --> 00:42:29,311  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
- You guys lookin' for a broker?
- Who the fuck are you?

676
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:31,715  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
- Easy.
- I'm not doin' anything.

677
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:33,751  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
l thought maybe you were lookin'
for somebody to invest with.

678
00:42:33,880 --> 00:42:37,429  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
- No. Yeah, we're fine. We are brokers.
- You are?

679
00:42:37,560 --> 00:42:41,235  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
- Yeah.
- You guys with Jacoby &Jacoby?

680
00:42:41,360 --> 00:42:44,875  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
-J.T. Marlin.
- Never heard of it.

681
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:47,719  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Hold on a second. Who are you?
What do you sell? Car insurance?

682
00:42:47,840 --> 00:42:51,389  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
We're with this little firm downtown.
Maybe you've heard of us J.P. Morgan?

683
00:42:51,520 --> 00:42:54,796  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
- And I'm a black Negro.
- Right.

684
00:42:54,920 --> 00:42:58,196  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
l know J.T. it's a fuckin' chop shop.
They named it so it sounds like ours.

685
00:42:58,320 --> 00:43:00,754  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
He knows that firm.
it's a fuckin' chop shop.

686
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:04,555  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
They named the firm to sound
like his. What is he, fucking Yogi Biz?

687
00:43:04,680 --> 00:43:07,831  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
- Shut the fuck up.
- We're not buying it.

688
00:43:07,960 --> 00:43:11,999  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
And what the fuck is with the suits?
You look like you're on Gotti's crew.

689
00:43:12,120 --> 00:43:15,192  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
- You look great. Seriously.
- Do you know who you're talkin' to?

690
00:43:15,320 --> 00:43:17,356  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
- Who are we talkin' to?
- You don't know?

691
00:43:17,480 --> 00:43:18,959  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Here's Vito and John Jr.

692
00:43:19,080 --> 00:43:21,514  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
l don't wanna get involved in this.
We're not bothering you.

693
00:43:21,640 --> 00:43:25,553  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
We're not.
Patrick, call out the police. Come on!

694
00:43:26,920 --> 00:43:30,071  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
it's my dad
that's the mess...

695
00:43:30,200 --> 00:43:34,159  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
but that's not
really interesting conversation.

696
00:43:34,280 --> 00:43:36,191  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
What about you?

697
00:43:36,320 --> 00:43:41,872  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Single mother. No money.
And now l take care of her.

698
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:46,790  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
- What's wrong?
- She's got chronic pneumonia.

699
00:43:46,920 --> 00:43:49,753  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
You know, she smoked for, like,
1 5 years, and now she's really sick.

700
00:43:49,880 --> 00:43:51,916  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
And it's--

701
00:43:52,040 --> 00:43:55,635  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
She's just really happy that l have
This job so l can support both of us.

702
00:43:55,760 --> 00:43:59,639  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
- But it's scary sometimes, you know?
- Yeah.

703
00:44:01,120 --> 00:44:03,588  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
What about your father?

704
00:44:03,720 --> 00:44:07,190  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
l don't wanna talk
about my father either.

705
00:44:15,400 --> 00:44:17,755  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Ready?

706
00:44:19,400 --> 00:44:22,039  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
- Tell me a story.
- What do you wanna hear?

707
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:25,914  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
l don't know. Tell me--
Tell me a story about your dad.

708
00:44:27,240 --> 00:44:29,913  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Well, l have
so many great ones.

709
00:44:30,040 --> 00:44:32,952  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Go on. Tell me.

710
00:44:35,080 --> 00:44:37,355  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
All right.

711
00:44:39,200 --> 00:44:41,839  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Well, I'm ten years old...

712
00:44:42,920 --> 00:44:45,878  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
and l just
got this new bike.

713
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:48,912  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
it's a silver Mongoose,
you know, like BMX.

714
00:44:49,040 --> 00:44:54,637  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
And I'm skidding out in this puddle
like Starsky and Hutch.

715
00:44:54,760 --> 00:44:58,230  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
- Right.
- And my foot slips...

716
00:44:58,360 --> 00:45:02,751  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
and the pedal spins around
hard enough to break my leg.

717
00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:04,677  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
- Oh, my God.
- But l don't fall off the bike.

718
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:09,828  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
- l keep going down this hill.
- And l get really scared, you know?

719
00:45:09,960 --> 00:45:12,633  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
So l jumped off the bike...

720
00:45:12,760 --> 00:45:15,115  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
and l landed
behind this parked car.

721
00:45:15,240 --> 00:45:20,439  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
And l was laying there
for a good half hour.

722
00:45:20,560 --> 00:45:22,471  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
And finally...

723
00:45:22,600 --> 00:45:26,036  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
l hear my father's voice up the street,
and he's calling my name.

724
00:45:26,160 --> 00:45:28,549  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
And l was so happy...

725
00:45:28,680 --> 00:45:30,910  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
that he was coming
to get me.

726
00:45:31,040 --> 00:45:35,830  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
And he comes around the car,
and he sees me lying there.

727
00:45:35,960 --> 00:45:38,758  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
l mean, there was--
there was blood everywhere.

728
00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:41,110  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Anyway,
l look up at him...

729
00:45:41,240 --> 00:45:45,916  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
and for the first time in my life,
l see how much my father loved me.

730
00:45:47,240 --> 00:45:50,471  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
- 'Cause he was completely frozen.
- Wow.

731
00:45:50,600 --> 00:45:53,956  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
You know, it hurt him to see me
in that much pain.

732
00:45:55,520 --> 00:45:57,397  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
So he leans down
over me...

733
00:45:58,920 --> 00:46:01,036  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
and he slaps me
across the face.

734
00:46:01,160 --> 00:46:04,948  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
What? Why?

735
00:46:05,080 --> 00:46:07,469  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
l don't know.

736
00:46:09,200 --> 00:46:13,512  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Maybe he was mad at me for
making him feel that helpless...

737
00:46:13,640 --> 00:46:18,111  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
or it was the only thing
he could think of.

738
00:46:18,240 --> 00:46:20,470  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
l don't really care
any more.

739
00:46:20,600 --> 00:46:24,593  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
What l think of now is the look
on his face when he saw me lying there.

740
00:46:26,640 --> 00:46:29,108  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
And that's what l remember.

741
00:46:31,240 --> 00:46:33,435  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
That's what l miss.

742
00:46:39,120 --> 00:46:41,588  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
There's your story.

743
00:46:42,680 --> 00:46:44,750  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Sorry.

744
00:46:47,720 --> 00:46:50,234  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
All right. l wanna talk
to you guys about appearance.

745
00:46:50,360 --> 00:46:54,319  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Okay? Because most of you
dress like shit.

746
00:46:54,440 --> 00:46:56,396  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
l don't know what
your financial situation is...

747
00:46:56,520 --> 00:46:59,717  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
and l don't want to, but you gotta get
yourself at least one decent suit...

748
00:46:59,840 --> 00:47:03,628  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
because we have a minimum level
of a esthetic professionalism here...

749
00:47:03,720 --> 00:47:05,278  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
that we have to maintain.

750
00:47:05,400 --> 00:47:07,231  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
In three months, you can outfit
your whole closet...

751
00:47:07,360 --> 00:47:08,873  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
but for now get something
to hold you over.

752
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:11,912  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
There's an important phrase
we use here.

753
00:47:12,040 --> 00:47:14,076  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
l think it's time
you all learned it.

754
00:47:15,360 --> 00:47:17,237  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
''Act as if.''

755
00:47:17,360 --> 00:47:19,351  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Do you understand what that means?

756
00:47:19,480 --> 00:47:22,119  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Act as if you are
the president of this firm.

757
00:47:22,240 --> 00:47:25,471  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Act as if you got a nine-inch cock.
Act as if.

758
00:47:25,600 --> 00:47:28,353  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
And to do that properly,
you need to at least look the part.

759
00:47:28,480 --> 00:47:32,029  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
So go get dressed. Secondly, it's time
to get your Series Seven books.

760
00:47:32,160 --> 00:47:34,674  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Don't get nervous.
If you study, you'll pass.

761
00:47:34,800 --> 00:47:38,952  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Then you begin trading
as an S.E.C.-licensed broker.

762
00:47:39,080 --> 00:47:42,993  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Then you're a fucking millionaire,
and it's just that simple.

763
00:47:43,120 --> 00:47:46,510  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
l need 300 bucks from each
of you for the books...

764
00:47:46,640 --> 00:47:49,154  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
which will be returned
if and when you pass the exam.

765
00:47:49,280 --> 00:47:52,590  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
And l need that tomorrow.
That is all.

766
00:47:58,880 --> 00:48:01,792  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
What are you?
Last night's erection?

767
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:04,195  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Yeah, well, you know--

768
00:48:07,680 --> 00:48:10,399  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
What's goin' on?
We're movin' to the big house, kids.

769
00:48:10,520 --> 00:48:14,798  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Isaac here just closed a guy
for 30,000 shares of Farrow Tech.

770
00:48:14,920 --> 00:48:16,717  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
We're on the big board.
We're in there now?

771
00:48:16,840 --> 00:48:20,150  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
- Who's out?
- Todd and company. Come on. Let's go.

772
00:48:20,280 --> 00:48:24,990  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
lf you couldn't pull $3,000 together,
your name wouldn't be on my desk.

773
00:48:25,120 --> 00:48:28,874  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
You're embarrassing me. I'm pitching you
from under my desk. I'm embarrassed now.

774
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:31,878  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Bob. Bob, be rude.
Hang up the phone.

775
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:34,434  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
You won't.
You wanna know why?

776
00:48:34,560 --> 00:48:38,314  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Because you see value. l am
your kids' college fund, for chrissakes.

777
00:48:38,440 --> 00:48:41,557  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
I'm gonna pass. The only people making
money passing are N.F.L. quarterbacks.

778
00:48:41,680 --> 00:48:45,195  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
- And l don't see a number on your back.
- Take me off your list.

779
00:48:45,320 --> 00:48:48,949  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Fine, fine. I'm gonna take you off
my list of successful people.

780
00:48:59,280 --> 00:49:00,554  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Hello?

781
00:49:00,680 --> 00:49:02,716  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Hi, Mr ''Dahvis, '' this is Ron
from the Daily News.

782
00:49:02,840 --> 00:49:05,912  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
- Howyou doin'?
- it's Davis, and I'm not interested.

783
00:49:06,040 --> 00:49:09,430  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
- Sorry to bot her you. Have a nice day.
- Wait a minute.

784
00:49:09,560 --> 00:49:13,189  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Wait. That's your pitch?
You consider that a sales call?

785
00:49:13,320 --> 00:49:15,629  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
You know, l get a call
from you guys every Saturday...

786
00:49:15,760 --> 00:49:17,591  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
and it's always
the same half-assed attempt.

787
00:49:17,720 --> 00:49:19,836  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
lf you guys wanna close me,
you should sell me.

788
00:49:19,960 --> 00:49:23,669  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
- All right.
- All right. Start again.

789
00:49:23,800 --> 00:49:26,951  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Okay. Hi, this is Ron
from the Daily News.

790
00:49:27,080 --> 00:49:30,834  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
- How you doin' this morning?
- Shitty. What do you want?

791
00:49:30,960 --> 00:49:33,428  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
It's not what I want, sir.
It's what you want.

792
00:49:33,560 --> 00:49:36,438  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Ron, now we're talkin'.
All right. What are you selling me?

793
00:49:36,560 --> 00:49:40,155  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
I'm offering a Daily News subscription
at a substantially reduced price.

794
00:49:40,280 --> 00:49:43,317  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
We're trying to reach out to people
that never had home delivery before.

795
00:49:43,440 --> 00:49:47,558  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
So everybody who already has a
subscription is getting fucked?

796
00:49:47,680 --> 00:49:51,116  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
- Yeah. I guess so.
- All right. l can handle that.

797
00:49:51,240 --> 00:49:54,152  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
So, why should l buy your paper?
l mean, you know--

798
00:49:54,280 --> 00:49:57,670  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Why shouldn't l get the Times
or the Voice, you know?

799
00:49:57,800 --> 00:50:00,837  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
The Village Voice is free, sir, so if
you want it, you should pick it up.

800
00:50:00,960 --> 00:50:04,509  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
But the Daily News offers you something
no other apercan.: a taste of New York.

801
00:50:04,640 --> 00:50:07,518  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
We have the best features, more photos
than any other daily in New York...

802
00:50:07,640 --> 00:50:09,835  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
and we have the most
reliable delivery in the city.

803
00:50:09,960 --> 00:50:10,995  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Now what do you think?

804
00:50:11,120 --> 00:50:14,078  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
You know what l think, Ron?
l think that was a sales call.

805
00:50:14,200 --> 00:50:16,668  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574

I know what you're sayin ''!

809
00:50:27,240 --> 00:50:30,152  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Booked. Booked.

810
00:50:30,280 --> 00:50:32,794  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Booked. Someone cover Greg.
Cover Greg.

811
00:50:36,120 --> 00:50:39,192  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
l hope you guys aren't fight in' over it.
Here. Good money against Greg's roll.

812
00:50:39,320 --> 00:50:42,835  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
- Put it there.
- Two hundred?

813
00:50:47,720 --> 00:50:50,996  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
- What is that?
- Nothing.

814
00:50:51,080 --> 00:50:53,878  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Damn. Who you gotta ass-fuck
to get a ten around here?

815
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:55,956  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
- There's a leprechaun in stall four.
- Whatever.

816
00:50:56,080 --> 00:50:58,799  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Hey, Seth, I'm gonna get some reserves.
You wanna come with me?

817
00:50:58,920 --> 00:51:00,239  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
- Yeah.
- You guys want a shot?

818
00:51:00,360 --> 00:51:03,193  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Roll a seven, baby. Let's go.

819
00:51:03,320 --> 00:51:07,393  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Quit starin'
and just apologize.

820
00:51:07,520 --> 00:51:11,115  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Hey, he doesn't have to say shit,
all right?

821
00:51:11,240 --> 00:51:14,277  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Why don't you go back to your Heineken
and shut the fuck up, okay?

822
00:51:14,400 --> 00:51:17,517  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Was l talkin' to you?

823
00:51:17,640 --> 00:51:19,949  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
No, you weren't.
You were talkin' to him.

824
00:51:20,080 --> 00:51:23,038  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
lf you're talkin' to him, you're talkin'
to me and my whole fuckin' crew, okay?

825
00:51:23,160 --> 00:51:27,756  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Get the fuck outta here.
What? What?

826
00:51:27,880 --> 00:51:30,713  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Get the fuck outta here before
l put you in a mayonnaise jar, okay?

827
00:51:30,840 --> 00:51:33,752  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Get the fuck outta here,
fuckin' cocksucker.

828
00:51:39,920 --> 00:51:43,708  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
He's gonna cry
like a little baby!

829
00:51:43,840 --> 00:51:46,877  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
You little baby!

830
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:49,434  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Hey, Richie!
Hey, Richie!

831
00:51:49,560 --> 00:51:52,518  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Oh, Mommy!

832
00:51:55,840 --> 00:51:57,910  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Come on.

833
00:52:02,240 --> 00:52:05,277  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
You gotta realize these aren't the kids
you and l grew up with, you know?

834
00:52:05,400 --> 00:52:10,349  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Remember in Hebrew school,
when a shoving match was a big deal?

835
00:52:10,480 --> 00:52:13,153  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Worst-case scenario, somebody
got their yarmulke knocked off.

836
00:52:15,200 --> 00:52:19,193  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
it's true, man.
These guys are no joke.

837
00:52:19,280 --> 00:52:22,352  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
They get all tanked up,
throw a quick fist.

838
00:52:22,480 --> 00:52:24,357  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Some of them actually enjoy it.

839
00:52:24,480 --> 00:52:27,074  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
l mean, like, Richie.
What the fuck is that, man?

840
00:52:27,200 --> 00:52:29,316  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Probably thought l was being
tough back there with that guy.

841
00:52:30,600 --> 00:52:32,238  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
l was shitting my pants.

842
00:52:32,360 --> 00:52:34,749  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
- l saw that.
- Oh, great. Thanks.

843
00:52:34,880 --> 00:52:38,395  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
These fuckin' Guineas, man.

844
00:52:38,480 --> 00:52:40,869  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Half of them do coke.
They all drink. Zero capital.

845
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:43,594  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
No fuckin' stability. They
make all this fucking money...

846
00:52:43,720 --> 00:52:46,996  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
and they're always
living three steps ahead.

847
00:52:47,080 --> 00:52:50,152  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
You know, there's guys who work at the
firm that make a million a year...

848
00:52:50,280 --> 00:52:53,272  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
and they can't even get a fucking
car loan 'cause their credit's so bad.

849
00:52:53,400 --> 00:52:55,630  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
it's like everybody is just waiting
for the 1 5th of the month.

850
00:52:55,760 --> 00:52:58,638  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
They may have a Porsche, but they don't
have ten bucks to put in the gas tank.

851
00:52:58,760 --> 00:53:01,558  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
- No shit.
- it's nigger rich.

852
00:53:03,760 --> 00:53:06,399  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
What is this guy doin'?
Yo!

853
00:53:16,200 --> 00:53:19,431  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
- All right. Thanks, man.
- Don't forget what l said about Abby.

854
00:53:19,560 --> 00:53:22,358  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
l think she's trouble,
you know?

855
00:53:22,480 --> 00:53:24,516  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
l don't even know
what you're talking about.

856
00:53:24,640 --> 00:53:26,471  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
l don't know.
I've just worked there a long time.

857
00:53:26,600 --> 00:53:28,875  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Just looking out for my friends.

858
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:32,231  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
l think she's a whore.
Just telling you.

859
00:53:32,360 --> 00:53:35,511  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Well, it's a good thing
you stopped dating her, then, right?

860
00:53:35,640 --> 00:53:38,074  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
- I'll see you later.
- All right. See you.

861
00:54:41,960 --> 00:54:45,669  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Of all the people at J.T. Marlin,
you picked this kid, Davis. Why?

862
00:54:45,800 --> 00:54:48,917  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
'Cause he's perfect. He's new,
so his loyalties don't run too deep.

863
00:54:49,040 --> 00:54:51,918  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
He also seems to be the smartest
Of this last group of trainees.

864
00:54:52,040 --> 00:54:55,430  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
The rest of them are fuckin' idiots
compared to this kid.

865
00:54:55,560 --> 00:54:58,757  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
He used to run a full-time casino
out of his house in Queens.

866
00:54:58,880 --> 00:55:03,317  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Now he just picks up the cheques.
He'll turn state's, no question.

867
00:55:03,440 --> 00:55:05,078  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
How are you gonna get to him?

868
00:55:05,160 --> 00:55:07,390  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
We started surveillance.
We'll get to him.

869
00:55:19,240 --> 00:55:21,231  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Hey, Jeff!

870
00:55:21,360 --> 00:55:23,794  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Hey, Jeff, get up here!

871
00:55:31,240 --> 00:55:33,037  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
What's goin' on?

872
00:55:33,160 --> 00:55:36,948  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
One week l can understand,
but it's approaching five weeks now...

873
00:55:37,080 --> 00:55:40,390  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
and the profits are down 40% since
the last week l was here full-time.

874
00:55:40,520 --> 00:55:43,671  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
I'm not you. I'm not gonna
fuckin' kill myself for half the profit.

875
00:55:43,800 --> 00:55:46,997  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
You get to come in here and just pick up
your fuckin' money, and it sucks.

876
00:55:47,120 --> 00:55:48,838  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
What?

877
00:55:48,960 --> 00:55:52,999  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Hey! Hey, you know what?
This is my business.

878
00:55:53,120 --> 00:55:55,111  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
You used to make
ten dollars an hour.

879
00:55:55,240 --> 00:55:58,312  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Now you're making 1 ,000 a week,
and you're still not happy?

880
00:55:58,440 --> 00:56:02,353  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
- What the fuck is going on?
- Nothin'. You can check the tapes.

881
00:56:02,480 --> 00:56:04,391  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
For what? l didn't say anything.
Are you skimming?

882
00:56:04,520 --> 00:56:07,796  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
No! No, l'm not skimming,
all right?

883
00:56:07,920 --> 00:56:09,956  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
l can't handle a 24-hour gig
all by myself.

884
00:56:10,080 --> 00:56:12,310  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
This isn't fuckin' Denny's.

885
00:56:12,440 --> 00:56:14,476  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
You know? I'm tryin'
to finish school here, man.

886
00:56:14,600 --> 00:56:17,239  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
All right. All right, so--
Look, why don't you do this?

887
00:56:17,360 --> 00:56:19,590  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Why don't you take on
another partner...

888
00:56:19,720 --> 00:56:25,158  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
and you can split your share
with him, which I'll up to 65%...

889
00:56:25,280 --> 00:56:28,192  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
and then you can go to school
during the day and work at night.

890
00:56:28,320 --> 00:56:31,676  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
I'm already doin' that.

891
00:56:31,800 --> 00:56:35,076  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
- You are?
- Yeah.

892
00:56:35,200 --> 00:56:36,918  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
l took Dave on
last month.

893
00:56:37,040 --> 00:56:40,032  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
And you still can't
fuckin' handle it?

894
00:56:40,160 --> 00:56:43,072  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
- it's a lot of work.
- Fuck!

895
00:56:43,200 --> 00:56:45,236  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Fuck.

896
00:56:45,360 --> 00:56:47,430  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
All right, that's it.
lt's over.

897
00:56:47,560 --> 00:56:49,869  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
I'm shutting it down.

898
00:56:52,360 --> 00:56:55,432  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
And get those kids
out of my fuckin' house.

899
00:56:55,720 --> 00:57:00,430  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
By delaying, you simply restrict
my ability to do my job.

900
00:57:00,560 --> 00:57:02,437  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Am I ? I'm not trying to--

901
00:57:02,560 --> 00:57:05,597  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Look, l didn't get to where l am today
by losing my clients' money.

902
00:57:05,720 --> 00:57:09,872  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Put your confidence
in myself and J.T. Marlin...

903
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:12,389  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
and I'm telling you,
we'll never have to ask for it again.

904
00:57:12,520 --> 00:57:16,479  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Put your confidence in myself
and J.T. Marlin...

905
00:57:16,600 --> 00:57:19,672  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
and I'm telling you, you will
never have to ask for it again.

906
00:57:23,800 --> 00:57:25,597  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Okay, let's do this.

907
00:57:26,240 --> 00:57:28,549  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Great. I'm gonna pass you on
to my secretary.

908
00:57:28,680 --> 00:57:31,148  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
You call me when
the stock doubles, all right?

909
00:57:31,360 --> 00:57:33,999  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Sheryl, make it so, baby!

910
00:57:34,120 --> 00:57:35,917  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
All right. So I got into it.

911
00:57:36,040 --> 00:57:38,349  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Do you know how good it feels
to close someone?

912
00:57:38,480 --> 00:57:41,916  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
To sell someone?
It's amazing.

913
00:57:42,040 --> 00:57:45,874  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
- What's goin' on?
- Seth just closed a guy for ten large.

914
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:48,434  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
- Amazing.
- Do you see what--

915
00:57:48,560 --> 00:57:51,154  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
You're one of us now.

916
00:57:51,280 --> 00:57:53,350  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
You popped your cherry!

917
00:57:53,480 --> 00:57:57,951  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
- Hey, Seth, come here a second.
- Yeah. Yes, sir. Yes, sir.

918
00:58:01,840 --> 00:58:04,798  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
- l just closed a huge account for you.
- Come here.

919
00:58:04,920 --> 00:58:06,672  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
What are you doing?
Get away from me.

920
00:58:06,800 --> 00:58:08,233  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
What the fuck are you doing?

921
00:58:08,360 --> 00:58:10,635  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
- What is this? Huh?
- What?

922
00:58:10,760 --> 00:58:12,591  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Who told you you could
close your own accounts?

923
00:58:12,720 --> 00:58:15,837  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
- What?
- You violated an S.E.C. regulation.

924
00:58:15,960 --> 00:58:17,916  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
You're a fucking trainee.

925
00:58:18,040 --> 00:58:20,952  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
You know, l just figured
I'd take the initiative...

926
00:58:21,080 --> 00:58:23,355  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
and, you know,
make you some money.

927
00:58:23,480 --> 00:58:26,074  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Greg, l was standing right next
to him the whole time.

928
00:58:26,200 --> 00:58:28,555  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
l would've stepped right in if the kid
would have gotten in trouble.

929
00:58:28,640 --> 00:58:31,632  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
You got a cannoli you can
stick in your mouth?

930
00:58:31,760 --> 00:58:33,830  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
No, you got a menorah
you can shove in your ass?

931
00:58:33,960 --> 00:58:35,757  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Fuck him. Come on.

932
00:58:35,880 --> 00:58:38,519  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
l don't even give a fuck
about the money, okay?

933
00:58:38,640 --> 00:58:40,312  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Do you know what would happen...

934
00:58:40,440 --> 00:58:42,954  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
if every trainee started
handling their own recos?

935
00:58:43,080 --> 00:58:46,755  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
- The shop would be closed in a week.
- ls this about something else?

936
00:58:46,840 --> 00:58:48,717  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
What would that be?

937
00:58:52,240 --> 00:58:54,151  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Great.

938
00:58:55,880 --> 00:58:58,110  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Don't you have to go
answer the phones or something?

939
00:59:00,600 --> 00:59:04,275  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
You know what? Fuck it.
We'll deal with this later.

940
00:59:08,680 --> 00:59:11,353  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Don't tell me that's why
l'm not hitting it any more.

941
00:59:11,480 --> 00:59:14,074  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Oh, honey, you were
never hitting it...

942
00:59:14,200 --> 00:59:16,077  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
and he's not
the reason, Greg.

943
00:59:16,200 --> 00:59:17,997  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
You are.

944
01:00:05,760 --> 01:00:09,150  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Jesus Christ,
they're all the same.

945
01:00:09,280 --> 01:00:12,238  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
- What's the same?
- Oh, my God.

946
01:00:12,360 --> 01:00:13,952  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
You scared me.

947
01:00:14,080 --> 01:00:16,469  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
I'm sorry.

948
01:00:16,600 --> 01:00:18,636  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
How long have you
been standing there?

949
01:00:18,760 --> 01:00:22,275  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
l just walked up. I'm sorry.
l didn't mean to scare you.

950
01:00:22,400 --> 01:00:25,949  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
No, no, that's all right.
Interesting reading?

951
01:00:26,080 --> 01:00:29,470  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
This? No, this is just
the prospectus...

952
01:00:29,600 --> 01:00:32,353  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
from the last I.P.O.
the firm put out.

953
01:00:32,480 --> 01:00:36,792  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
l know what it is. l was just asking
if you thought it was interesting.

954
01:00:36,920 --> 01:00:40,196  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
You know, you might be the first person
to read a J.T. prospectus.

955
01:00:40,320 --> 01:00:42,356  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Really?

956
01:00:42,480 --> 01:00:45,233  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Yeah. So, what are
you looking for?

957
01:00:45,360 --> 01:00:47,954  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
I'm just looking for
some chocolate love.

958
01:00:51,160 --> 01:00:54,197  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
You know what? Would you like me
to practise my pitch?

959
01:00:54,320 --> 01:00:57,278  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
- 'Cause l know it turns you on.
- Oh, God.

960
01:01:04,880 --> 01:01:06,677  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
You know, I saw John Feiner...

961
01:01:06,800 --> 01:01:09,997  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
shredding a bunch of documents
the other day.

962
01:01:10,120 --> 01:01:11,997  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
You don't think that's weird?

963
01:01:12,120 --> 01:01:15,430  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
You say you like the hard sell
and the money.

964
01:01:15,520 --> 01:01:17,351  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

965
01:01:17,440 --> 01:01:21,513  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
And then you question it the minute
you see something a bit off.

966
01:01:23,720 --> 01:01:25,915  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
No, I'm serious.
Either you need to admit to yourself...

967
01:01:26,040 --> 01:01:30,113  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
that it's not charity work
and enjoy it, or get out.

968
01:01:32,160 --> 01:01:36,870  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
But you cannot keep going back
and forth like this. it's ridiculous.

969
01:01:43,800 --> 01:01:46,758  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Can you buy a bigger bed
When you get some money, please?

970
01:01:46,880 --> 01:01:49,758  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
How big is your bed?
Bigger than this one.

971
01:01:49,880 --> 01:01:52,758  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
You have a huge bed?

972
01:01:56,800 --> 01:01:59,598  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
- Hello?
- Hi, Harry. Seth Davisat J. T. Marlin.

973
01:01:59,720 --> 01:02:01,517  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
- How are you doing this morning?
- Fine, thanks.

974
01:02:01,640 --> 01:02:03,437  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
You got a call from
an associate last month.

975
01:02:03,560 --> 01:02:05,596  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
l wanted to know if you enjoyed
the information we sent you.

976
01:02:05,720 --> 01:02:08,075  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
What information?

977
01:02:08,200 --> 01:02:10,316  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
lf you get as much mail as l do,
you probably brushed it aside.

978
01:02:10,440 --> 01:02:13,432  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
But more importantly, we made
a commitment to get back to you.

979
01:02:13,560 --> 01:02:16,518  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Listen, I'm presenting you with
an investment opportunity...

980
01:02:16,640 --> 01:02:18,278  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
that I think you'll find interesting.

981
01:02:18,400 --> 01:02:19,913  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
l'm not in the market for that.

982
01:02:20,040 --> 01:02:22,759  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Tell me, Harry, are you married
or are you happy?

983
01:02:22,880 --> 01:02:25,235  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Actually, I've been married
for ten years.

984
01:02:25,360 --> 01:02:27,999  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Oh, yeah? That's great.
Yeah, six years for me.

985
01:02:28,120 --> 01:02:31,351  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
So, listen. Are you
playing the market at all?

986
01:02:31,480 --> 01:02:34,233  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
l don't know about playing.
l do own some blue chips.

987
01:02:34,360 --> 01:02:36,590  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
They were actually
wedding gifts from friends.

988
01:02:36,720 --> 01:02:40,076  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Listen, we have an explosive situation
going on right now.

989
01:02:40,200 --> 01:02:42,031  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
A pharmaceutical company,
Farrow Tech...

990
01:02:42,160 --> 01:02:45,914  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
has a drug called Parattin
in the third stage of F.D.A. approval.

991
01:02:46,040 --> 01:02:47,837  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
- What's it do?
- That's a good question.

992
01:02:47,960 --> 01:02:50,190  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
That's a very good question,
and this is the best part.

993
01:02:50,320 --> 01:02:52,356  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
it helps premature babies
develop properly.

994
01:02:52,480 --> 01:02:54,311  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
- That sounds like a good drug.
- it is. it is.

995
01:02:54,440 --> 01:02:58,319  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
So, those blue chips you own, what have
they done since you got married?

996
01:02:58,440 --> 01:03:01,398  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
- Not that much, really.
- We deal in stocks that really move.

997
01:03:01,520 --> 01:03:03,750  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Oh, yeah.
They really move.

998
01:03:03,880 --> 01:03:07,634  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
I'd love to show you what l mean,
and l can do so on a small investment.

999
01:03:07,760 --> 01:03:09,557  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
l really can't
buy anything right now.

1000
01:03:09,680 --> 01:03:11,875  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
My wife and l are getting ready
to buy a house this month...

1001
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:14,594  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
and we're trying to save
every last penny.

1002
01:03:14,720 --> 01:03:17,075  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Look, l don't care
how much stock you pick up.

1003
01:03:17,200 --> 01:03:18,713  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
l just want you to test me out.

1004
01:03:18,840 --> 01:03:21,673  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
l want you to judge me
on the percentages l show you.

1005
01:03:21,800 --> 01:03:24,837  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
l show you 30 or 40%, no matter how big
or small your position is...

1006
01:03:24,960 --> 01:03:28,157  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
you're gonna get excited
about my next idea, right?

1007
01:03:28,280 --> 01:03:30,396  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
- Yeah.
- You'd hand out my business cards.

1008
01:03:30,520 --> 01:03:34,672  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Right? Do this:
Pick up a hundred shares.

1009
01:03:34,800 --> 01:03:37,030  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
it's the absolute firm minimum.
lf l show you...

1010
01:03:37,160 --> 01:03:39,151  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
three or four points on the trade,
it's not gonna make you rich.

1011
01:03:39,280 --> 01:03:41,669  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
On the same token,
If the stock doesn't go anywhere...

1012
01:03:41,800 --> 01:03:43,597  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
you're not in front of your store
with a cup in your hand.

1013
01:03:43,720 --> 01:03:46,917  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
- No, that's true.
- Look, the truth of the matter is...

1014
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:49,355  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
l could sell you more
than 1 00 shares...

1015
01:03:49,480 --> 01:03:51,198  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
and feel completely
comfortable about the trade.

1016
01:03:51,320 --> 01:03:55,472  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
But I'm asking you to start small
just to prove what l can do for you.

1017
01:03:57,720 --> 01:03:59,517  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
All right.
Let's try it.

1018
01:03:59,640 --> 01:04:02,916  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Great. Should l send the confirmation
to your business or your home?

1019
01:04:03,040 --> 01:04:04,996  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
l need to talk to my wife.

1020
01:04:05,120 --> 01:04:07,076  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
No, you don't need to do that.
I'll call you right back.

1021
01:04:07,200 --> 01:04:09,998  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
- I'm goin' to lunch in five minutes.
- l need to talk to her first.

1022
01:04:10,120 --> 01:04:12,315  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
- Harry, you're at work, aren't you?
- Yeah.

1023
01:04:12,440 --> 01:04:13,953  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
What do you do for a living?

1024
01:04:14,080 --> 01:04:16,799  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
l'm a purchasing manager
at a gourmet foods company.

1025
01:04:16,920 --> 01:04:19,480  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
- Does your job involve decisions?
- Of course.

1026
01:04:19,600 --> 01:04:22,672  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
When you're making decisions, do you
call your wife and ask her what to do?

1027
01:04:22,800 --> 01:04:24,597  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Of course not.
But that's a little different.

1028
01:04:24,720 --> 01:04:27,393  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
How is that different?
it's your money. You earned it.

1029
01:04:27,520 --> 01:04:30,717  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
All you're doing is investing it.
I'm not selling crack here.

1030
01:04:30,840 --> 01:04:32,398  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
She's only gonna be happy...

1031
01:04:32,520 --> 01:04:34,715  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
when she sees that you made
a wise investment for the family.

1032
01:04:34,840 --> 01:04:36,831  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Just think of the flip side.
When your wife does the shopping...

1033
01:04:36,960 --> 01:04:40,077  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
does she call you to find out if she can
use a coupon for Cap'n Crunch?

1034
01:04:40,200 --> 01:04:43,556  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
- Now, come on. That's not being fair.
- No, I know.

1035
01:04:43,680 --> 01:04:47,832  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Look, Harry. I'm just trying
to make a point here.

1036
01:04:47,960 --> 01:04:51,350  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Look, we're not talking about
a lot of money here.

1037
01:04:51,480 --> 01:04:55,712  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Just think what she'll say when you
bring home a big fat cheque...

1038
01:04:55,840 --> 01:05:00,072  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
because you had the foresight
to see a good thing coming.

1039
01:05:02,680 --> 01:05:05,513  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
- All right. Let's try it.
- Goodman, Harry.

1040
01:05:05,640 --> 01:05:07,710  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
You made a great decision,
all right?

1041
01:05:07,840 --> 01:05:10,957  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Hold on a second.
Do it.

1042
01:05:13,560 --> 01:05:15,596  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Hello?

1043
01:05:15,720 --> 01:05:18,154  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
- Yo.
- Hey, what's up?

1044
01:05:18,280 --> 01:05:20,635  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
You passed the Series Seven.
Decide where we're celebrating tonight.

1045
01:05:20,760 --> 01:05:24,548  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
l was thinking that we should
go to the city tonight...

1046
01:05:24,680 --> 01:05:26,875  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
'cause we're always drinking
at those shitty local bars.

1047
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:29,912  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
l think we should go to
a decent bar with some decent poo-poo.

1048
01:05:30,040 --> 01:05:32,474  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
lf l have to look at one more
housewife smoking a Newport...

1049
01:05:32,600 --> 01:05:34,477  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
l think I'm gonna puke.

1050
01:05:34,600 --> 01:05:37,353  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Let me roundup the guys.
We'll come pick you up.

1051
01:05:37,480 --> 01:05:39,152  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
- All right.
- You got it.

1052
01:05:39,280 --> 01:05:40,599  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Okay, bye.

1053
01:05:40,720 --> 01:05:45,475  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
This guy probably got more rooms
in there than he's ever even been in.

1054
01:05:45,600 --> 01:05:48,068  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Look at it.
it's fuckin' huge.

1055
01:05:48,200 --> 01:05:51,033  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Hey, Chris, why do you
still live with your mother?

1056
01:05:51,160 --> 01:05:52,991  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
What do you mean?

1057
01:06:02,840 --> 01:06:06,071  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Do you ever wonder
how we make the rips that we do?

1058
01:06:06,200 --> 01:06:10,796  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
How is it that we make rips
that pay out...

1059
01:06:10,920 --> 01:06:12,751  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
more than any other
major firm?

1060
01:06:12,880 --> 01:06:15,792  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
You're kidding me, right?

1061
01:06:15,920 --> 01:06:17,399  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
That's the wrong--

1062
01:06:17,520 --> 01:06:19,750  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
That's the wrong question
to be asking.

1063
01:06:19,880 --> 01:06:21,996  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
- Why?
- The only thing to worry about...

1064
01:06:22,120 --> 01:06:24,395  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
is how you're gonna
get laid tonight.

1065
01:06:26,080 --> 01:06:28,389  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
No, I'm serious.

1066
01:06:28,520 --> 01:06:31,080  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Don't you know that
S.E.C. regulations state...

1067
01:06:31,200 --> 01:06:34,431  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
that the maximum rip allowed
is five percent of the sale...

1068
01:06:34,560 --> 01:06:36,869  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
and we're making, like,
four times that?

1069
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:42,154  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
You just passed your Series Seven;
now you're an inspector or something?

1070
01:06:42,280 --> 01:06:45,033  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
- Aren't you happy with things?
- Yeah, of course.

1071
01:06:45,160 --> 01:06:47,833  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
No, I'm just curious.
You're not curious?

1072
01:06:47,960 --> 01:06:51,157  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Not at all.
l like being a millionaire.

1073
01:06:51,280 --> 01:06:54,670  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
And you will too,
believe me.

1074
01:06:54,800 --> 01:06:58,076  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
- What's up?
- You need help?

1075
01:06:58,200 --> 01:07:00,475  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
- With what?
- Getting into the fuckin' child's seat.

1076
01:07:00,600 --> 01:07:02,431  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Come on.
Shotgun.

1077
01:07:07,720 --> 01:07:09,517  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Why did the feminist
cross the road?

1078
01:07:09,640 --> 01:07:12,393  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
To suck my fuckin' cock.

1079
01:07:13,800 --> 01:07:16,837  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
- That's funny.
- Damn straight.

1080
01:07:16,960 --> 01:07:19,599  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
- Order me another one.
- Who U.A.T.'d this beer for me?

1081
01:07:19,720 --> 01:07:22,473  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
- l did. What's up?
- l hate it. Send the shit back.

1082
01:07:22,600 --> 01:07:25,433  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
- What's a U.A.T.?
- Unauthorized trade.

1083
01:07:25,560 --> 01:07:27,630  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Seth, anything killing you yet?

1084
01:07:27,760 --> 01:07:31,639  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
All right, yeah.
You know what l fuckin' hate?

1085
01:07:31,760 --> 01:07:35,594  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Is getting past the secretaries.
it doesn't matter if you're a broker.

1086
01:07:35,720 --> 01:07:39,076  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
it's still a sales call,
and they fuckin' know that.

1087
01:07:39,200 --> 01:07:41,634  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
- One day I'm gonna open a firm.
- Hold on a second.

1088
01:07:41,760 --> 01:07:43,193  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
You're opening things now?

1089
01:07:43,320 --> 01:07:45,197  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Kid just passed his test;
now he knows everything.

1090
01:07:45,320 --> 01:07:49,029  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
What's wrong with you? You haven't
even popped your cherry yet.

1091
01:07:52,720 --> 01:07:54,915  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Hey, whatever.
Let's toast the slut. Here you go.

1092
01:07:55,040 --> 01:07:58,157  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Bring it up for the kid.
Highest Series Seven score this month.

1093
01:07:59,920 --> 01:08:01,638  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Big swinging dick,
enjoy it while it lasts.

1094
01:08:04,800 --> 01:08:07,678  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Do you guys think you could
just try and keep it down some?

1095
01:08:07,800 --> 01:08:11,315  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
You guys are at a ten.
We could use you at a two.

1096
01:08:11,440 --> 01:08:13,396  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
- You got to be kidding me.
- I'm sorry about that.

1097
01:08:13,520 --> 01:08:17,559  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Why don't you just concentrate
on your food instead of us, all right?

1098
01:08:17,680 --> 01:08:20,399  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
What are you guys eating?
A tube steak smothered in underwear?

1099
01:08:25,200 --> 01:08:26,838  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Hey, great outfits.

1100
01:08:26,960 --> 01:08:28,757  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
You guys coming from
a city council meeting...

1101
01:08:28,880 --> 01:08:31,269  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
or are you trying to get lucky
with the bridge-and-tunnel crowd?

1102
01:08:31,400 --> 01:08:34,278  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
You tell'em, girl.

1103
01:08:34,400 --> 01:08:36,436  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
You know what they should do
with you guys?

1104
01:08:36,560 --> 01:08:39,757  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
They should throw all of you
on a fucking island somewhere.

1105
01:08:39,880 --> 01:08:42,348  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
- Oh, yeah. Hey, guess what.
- What?

1106
01:08:42,480 --> 01:08:45,153  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
You're on it.

1107
01:08:46,720 --> 01:08:48,915  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
He got a point.

1108
01:08:49,040 --> 01:08:51,429  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Way to go, girl.

1109
01:08:51,560 --> 01:08:53,949  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Here you go.

1110
01:08:59,960 --> 01:09:01,791  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
You take it.

1111
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:05,594  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Hey, Harry,
who's J.T. Marlin?

1112
01:09:05,720 --> 01:09:09,156  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
l forgot to tell you.
l bought a little bit of stock.

1113
01:09:09,280 --> 01:09:11,748  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
What'd you buy?

1114
01:09:11,880 --> 01:09:13,950  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
it's this pharmaceutical company.
it's poised for a big jump.

1115
01:09:14,040 --> 01:09:16,315  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
They make a new drug that helps...

1116
01:09:16,440 --> 01:09:18,431  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
premature babies
survive the first three months.

1117
01:09:18,560 --> 01:09:21,120  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
That's great.
Yeah, that's great.

1118
01:09:21,240 --> 01:09:25,552  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
- So how much did you buy?
- Nothing crazy. Just 1 00 shares.

1119
01:09:25,680 --> 01:09:28,752  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
- At what price?
- Eight dollars. it's okay. Relax.

1120
01:09:28,880 --> 01:09:32,839  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Okay. So, how'd you
even know who to call?

1121
01:09:32,960 --> 01:09:35,520  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
- Actually, he called me.
- Who did?

1122
01:09:35,640 --> 01:09:37,995  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Seth Davis, the broker.

1123
01:09:38,120 --> 01:09:41,112  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
He's a really great guy.
He's a family man, actually.

1124
01:09:41,240 --> 01:09:43,800  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
How did he
get your name?

1125
01:09:43,920 --> 01:09:46,036  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
- l have no idea.
- Doesn't that worry you?

1126
01:09:46,160 --> 01:09:48,833  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
it's just-- it's okay.
Relax, all right?

1127
01:09:48,960 --> 01:09:50,916  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
- Okay.
- it's a small investment.

1128
01:09:51,040 --> 01:09:53,349  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
And I'm just
testing this guy out.

1129
01:09:53,480 --> 01:09:57,598  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
lf he doesn't show us any gains,
l won't do business with him again.

1130
01:09:57,720 --> 01:09:59,472  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Okay.

1131
01:09:59,640 --> 01:10:02,757  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
I don't know why the hell
I walked in there.

1132
01:10:02,880 --> 01:10:04,677  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Things were going well forme.

1133
01:10:04,800 --> 01:10:08,349  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Ihad passed the Series Seven
and was closing my40accounts for Greg.

1134
01:10:08,480 --> 01:10:10,869  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
I didn't wanna go in.
I really didn't.

1135
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:14,629  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
But part of me had to know what Michael
Was doing in there the week before.

1136
01:10:14,760 --> 01:10:17,035  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
And why would they be walking
into the building next door?

1137
01:10:17,160 --> 01:10:19,116  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
The place was empty.

1138
01:10:19,240 --> 01:10:21,071  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
I should've just let it go.

1139
01:10:30,200 --> 01:10:32,555  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
- Do we have parking?
- Again? Why?

1140
01:10:32,680 --> 01:10:35,399  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
l want the garage.

1141
01:10:35,520 --> 01:10:38,273  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Do we have the same
security guy or what?

1142
01:10:38,400 --> 01:10:40,197  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
- Are these hooked up?
- Yeah. All that stuff.

1143
01:10:40,320 --> 01:10:43,471  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
lf the heat comes and we have to jump,
how long will it take to move the firm?

1144
01:10:43,600 --> 01:10:46,034  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
- Under two hours, literally.
- Everything.

1145
01:10:46,160 --> 01:10:48,913  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
- They'll can make calls that afternoon.
- Okay.

1146
01:10:49,040 --> 01:10:51,998  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
All right. l gotta get back
to that phone call, but--

1147
01:10:52,120 --> 01:10:55,192  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
My first thought was that we
were moving to nicer offices.

1148
01:10:55,320 --> 01:10:56,719  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Nice thought.

1149
01:10:56,840 --> 01:11:00,719  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
I came to realize it was a quick out
Fr Michael if things got out of hand.

1150
01:11:09,760 --> 01:11:13,912  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Miss Halprin. Special Agent Drew, F.B.I.
This is Agent Etkin.

1151
01:11:14,040 --> 01:11:17,112  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
We'd like to talk to you about
your relationship with Seth Davis...

1152
01:11:17,240 --> 01:11:19,515  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
and about your mother's health.

1153
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:25,036  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Didn't take me long
to close the 40accounts.

1154
01:11:25,120 --> 01:11:28,430  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
I was closing five a day, sometimes six.
Just killing it.

1155
01:11:28,560 --> 01:11:30,994  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Greg certainly didn't
make it easy, though.

1156
01:11:31,120 --> 01:11:32,519  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
But I was focused.

1157
01:11:32,640 --> 01:11:35,108  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
I was about to start making
the serious dough.

1158
01:11:35,240 --> 01:11:37,708  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
I was about to be on my own.

1159
01:11:37,840 --> 01:11:40,832  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
All right. At the house.
Sheryl. Yes'!

1160
01:11:40,960 --> 01:11:43,315  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
My first whale. My first account.
My book, baby.

1161
01:11:43,440 --> 01:11:47,433  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Seth, l hate to bust in
on your little victory speech...

1162
01:11:47,560 --> 01:11:50,279  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
but that's your 40th account.

1163
01:11:50,360 --> 01:11:53,557  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
I'm out of the junior broker programme.
l don't work for you no more.

1164
01:11:53,680 --> 01:11:58,310  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
That's true. You're out,
but that account's mine.

1165
01:12:00,560 --> 01:12:02,357  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
What? Fuck that.
No, l keep the 40th.

1166
01:12:04,200 --> 01:12:06,077  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
- No, you don't.
- What?

1167
01:12:06,200 --> 01:12:08,998  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Wait a minute.
Is this about Abby?

1168
01:12:09,120 --> 01:12:11,998  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Are you that
fucking bitter?

1169
01:12:12,120 --> 01:12:13,792  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
l made a lot of money for you
in the past three months.

1170
01:12:13,920 --> 01:12:16,036  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
More than any other trainee.

1171
01:12:16,160 --> 01:12:19,391  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
You're not listening to me, all right?
l couldn't do it if l wanted to.

1172
01:12:19,520 --> 01:12:21,909  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
What-- Rules are rules, man.

1173
01:12:22,040 --> 01:12:24,713  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Oh, man!

1174
01:12:24,840 --> 01:12:27,752  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Don't be a dick.
You know you can bend the rules.

1175
01:12:27,880 --> 01:12:30,030  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
l gave each one of my guys their 40th.
Come on.

1176
01:12:30,160 --> 01:12:33,835  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Do me a favour. Shut your fucking mouth.
Okay? I'm not talking to you.

1177
01:12:33,960 --> 01:12:36,599  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
You know what? Fuck you.
Fuck you!

1178
01:12:43,360 --> 01:12:46,158  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
You're on my team.
You understand that?

1179
01:12:47,240 --> 01:12:50,152  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
l am not on yours.

1180
01:12:50,280 --> 01:12:52,350  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Don't you ever
forget that, bitch.

1181
01:13:14,320 --> 01:13:17,039  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
How's everybody doing?

1182
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:21,070  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
l wanted to congratulate
you all on a huge month.

1183
01:13:21,200 --> 01:13:22,679  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
For any of you
not yet convinced...

1184
01:13:22,800 --> 01:13:27,635  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
these were the top dogs of the month:
Jim Young, $280,000;

1185
01:13:27,760 --> 01:13:30,558  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Chris Varick, $205,000;

1186
01:13:30,680 --> 01:13:33,513  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
and Greg Weinstein, $1 90,000.

1187
01:13:35,640 --> 01:13:37,517  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
This month's gonna be bigger.

1188
01:13:37,640 --> 01:13:40,234  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
it's actually gonna be
the biggest month we ever had.

1189
01:13:42,520 --> 01:13:45,592  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
l got a new issue l wanna
talk to you about. Okay?

1190
01:13:45,720 --> 01:13:47,438  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
it's called Med Patent.

1191
01:13:48,880 --> 01:13:51,952  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
They just designed the world's
first retractable syringe.

1192
01:13:52,080 --> 01:13:55,436  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
That means that nurses
and doctors will never again...

1193
01:13:55,560 --> 01:13:58,028  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
have to worry about infection
from dirty needles.

1194
01:13:58,160 --> 01:14:01,357  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
This is not going to be an alternative
in the medical world.

1195
01:14:01,480 --> 01:14:03,755  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
This is gonna be the standard.

1196
01:14:03,880 --> 01:14:07,634  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
We all know that we're here
to make money.

1197
01:14:07,760 --> 01:14:10,479  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
But if we can do something good
like this, it's all the better.

1198
01:14:12,080 --> 01:14:13,957  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
So l want you to go out...

1199
01:14:14,080 --> 01:14:17,959  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
and buy yourselves
a new car.

1200
01:14:18,040 --> 01:14:21,191  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Go buy yourself a house.
Go into debt.

1201
01:14:21,320 --> 01:14:24,073  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
You are gonna make a million dollars
inside of six months.

1202
01:14:28,800 --> 01:14:32,395  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Now onto matters of recreation.
We're gonna take a class trip tonight.

1203
01:14:33,840 --> 01:14:37,355  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
So call your moms
and tell them not to wait up!

1204
01:14:57,080 --> 01:15:00,072  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
We're players now, boys!
Let's celebrate! Salute!

1205
01:15:19,680 --> 01:15:22,035  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
What's wrong?

1206
01:15:22,160 --> 01:15:23,957  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Nothin'.

1207
01:15:25,040 --> 01:15:26,951  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Seth, l know you.

1208
01:15:28,040 --> 01:15:30,270  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Just work.

1209
01:15:31,320 --> 01:15:33,197  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
it's your father, isn't it?

1210
01:15:33,320 --> 01:15:36,676  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
No, no, everything's great
with my dad.

1211
01:15:39,080 --> 01:15:41,833  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
He's taking me out to lunch next week
on his request.

1212
01:15:44,080 --> 01:15:48,073  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
- Do you know how happy that makes me?
- l do.

1213
01:15:48,200 --> 01:15:51,078  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
You know-- l mean,
it's all based on this job...

1214
01:15:51,200 --> 01:15:53,270  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
this very legitimate,
respectable job...

1215
01:15:53,400 --> 01:15:56,790  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
that he can tell his friends about
during the Yom Kippur appeal.

1216
01:15:58,360 --> 01:16:01,193  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
But I'll take it.
l mean--

1217
01:16:01,320 --> 01:16:03,595  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Oh, fuck.

1218
01:16:03,720 --> 01:16:06,757  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
l'm so fuckin' close.

1219
01:16:07,840 --> 01:16:09,910  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
You know?
And I'm fucking it up.

1220
01:16:10,040 --> 01:16:11,951  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
l mean, l--

1221
01:16:12,080 --> 01:16:13,877  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
How are you
fucking it up?

1222
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:17,549  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
l went to the Med Patent office
this morning, and there isn't one.

1223
01:16:17,680 --> 01:16:19,477  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
it's cardboard.
There's nothing.

1224
01:16:19,600 --> 01:16:21,272  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
There's no employees.

1225
01:16:21,400 --> 01:16:23,709  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
There's no research
and development. Nothing.

1226
01:16:23,840 --> 01:16:25,831  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
l found out how Michael's
making his money.

1227
01:16:25,960 --> 01:16:29,509  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
We're selling stock
for companies that don't exist.

1228
01:16:30,800 --> 01:16:33,758  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
- Do you know what bridge financing is?
- No.

1229
01:16:33,880 --> 01:16:36,838  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Basically,
it's a way to raise capital...

1230
01:16:36,960 --> 01:16:39,758  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
for a company that's
trying to go public.

1231
01:16:39,880 --> 01:16:41,950  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
They get money
from outside investors.

1232
01:16:42,080 --> 01:16:45,311  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
They're the bridge.
And it's perfectly legal...

1233
01:16:45,440 --> 01:16:49,149  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
as long as there's no connection
between the investors and the firm.

1234
01:16:49,280 --> 01:16:53,159  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
But Michael's fronting his friends
as the investors on every I.P.O. we do.

1235
01:16:53,280 --> 01:16:56,078  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
So that's why all the names
on the contracts are the same.

1236
01:16:57,720 --> 01:17:00,917  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Right. Then he has us
push it all on the open market.

1237
01:17:01,040 --> 01:17:03,031  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
We're basically selling
Michael's shares.

1238
01:17:03,160 --> 01:17:04,957  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
That's where
the two-dollar rips come in.

1239
01:17:05,080 --> 01:17:07,833  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
He can pay us that much,
and it's worth it for him...

1240
01:17:07,960 --> 01:17:11,589  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
because he depends on us
to literally create the market for him.

1241
01:17:11,680 --> 01:17:15,673  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
There's no other firm selling this shit.
it's all artificial demand.

1242
01:17:15,800 --> 01:17:17,711  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
As soon as we
sell off his position...

1243
01:17:17,840 --> 01:17:20,593  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
there's no need to maintain
the inflated price any more.

1244
01:17:20,720 --> 01:17:23,598  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
- We stop pushing it, and then--
- And then it crashes.

1245
01:17:23,720 --> 01:17:25,836  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Right.

1246
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:29,833  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
But, l mean, how does that
really affect me?

1247
01:17:29,960 --> 01:17:33,635  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
I'm just selling stock.
There's nothing wrong with that.

1248
01:17:33,720 --> 01:17:35,790  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
So l know now how Michael
makes his own money.

1249
01:17:35,920 --> 01:17:37,638  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
And l know that I'm not working
at Goldman Sachs...

1250
01:17:37,760 --> 01:17:39,159  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
but we already know that.

1251
01:17:40,880 --> 01:17:43,235  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
So how does this
really change anything?

1252
01:17:43,360 --> 01:17:46,989  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
l don't know, Seth.
You tell me.

1253
01:17:59,800 --> 01:18:02,109  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
What?

1254
01:18:09,200 --> 01:18:11,430  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
J.T. Marlin.
How may l direct your call?

1255
01:18:11,560 --> 01:18:14,313  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
I think I'll
just talk to you.

1256
01:18:17,160 --> 01:18:19,674  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Why are you
calling me here?

1257
01:18:19,800 --> 01:18:23,793  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Time's running out, Abby.
I need to know what he's doing.

1258
01:18:23,920 --> 01:18:28,118  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
You know what?
I'm getting a little bit tired of this.

1259
01:18:28,240 --> 01:18:31,676  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
l don't even know why l talked to you.
You have nothing on me.

1260
01:18:31,800 --> 01:18:33,756  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
I'm gonna hang up
this phone now.

1261
01:18:33,880 --> 01:18:35,677  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
You're putting all
the deals through.

1262
01:18:35,800 --> 01:18:38,837  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Your signature's on every sell ticket.
Sogo ahead, hang up.

1263
01:18:38,960 --> 01:18:41,679  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
We'll send a car over for you
This afternoon.

1264
01:18:46,840 --> 01:18:48,990  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Goddam it,
you fuckin' guys!

1265
01:18:49,120 --> 01:18:50,917  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
I'm gonna
keep this short, okay?

1266
01:18:51,040 --> 01:18:52,837  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
You passed your Sevens
over a month ago.

1267
01:18:52,960 --> 01:18:55,838  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Seth's the only one that's opened
40 accounts for his team leader.

1268
01:18:55,960 --> 01:18:58,679  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
When l was a junior broker,
l did it in 26 days. Okay?

1269
01:18:58,800 --> 01:19:01,553  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
You're not sending out
press packets any more.

1270
01:19:01,680 --> 01:19:03,796  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
None of this ''Debbie the
Time-Life operator'' bullshit.

1271
01:19:03,920 --> 01:19:05,956  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
So get on the phones!
it's time to get to work!

1272
01:19:06,080 --> 01:19:09,629  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Get off your ass! Move around!
Motion creates emotion!

1273
01:19:09,760 --> 01:19:12,479  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
l remember one time l had this guy
call me up, wanted to pitch me.

1274
01:19:12,600 --> 01:19:15,797  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Right?
Wanted to sell me stock, so l let him.

1275
01:19:15,920 --> 01:19:17,672  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
l got every fuckin' rebuttal
out of this guy.

1276
01:19:17,800 --> 01:19:19,597  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Kept him on the phone
for an hour and half.

1277
01:19:19,720 --> 01:19:23,030  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Towards the end, l asked him questions
like, ''What's the firm minimum?''

1278
01:19:23,160 --> 01:19:26,152  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
That's a buying question. Right there,
that guy's gotta take me down.

1279
01:19:26,280 --> 01:19:29,158  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
it's not like ''What's your 800 number?''
That's a fuck-off question.

1280
01:19:29,280 --> 01:19:31,919  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
l was giving him a run,
and he blew it.

1281
01:19:32,040 --> 01:19:34,076  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
To a question like,
''What is the firm minimum?''

1282
01:19:34,200 --> 01:19:36,395  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
The answer is zero.

1283
01:19:36,520 --> 01:19:38,272  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
You don't like the idea;
don't pick up a single share.

1284
01:19:38,360 --> 01:19:40,920  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
But this putz is telling me,
you know, ''Uh, 1 00 shares.''

1285
01:19:41,040 --> 01:19:42,917  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Wrong answer! No!

1286
01:19:43,040 --> 01:19:45,270  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
You have
to be closing all the time!

1287
01:19:45,400 --> 01:19:47,356  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
And be aggressive.
Learn how to push.

1288
01:19:47,480 --> 01:19:49,357  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Talk to 'em.
Ask'em questions.

1289
01:19:49,480 --> 01:19:51,391  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Ask 'em rhetorical questions.
lt doesn't matter.

1290
01:19:51,520 --> 01:19:53,397  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Anything.
Just get a ''yes'' out of'em.

1291
01:19:53,520 --> 01:19:56,990  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
''lf you're drowning and l throw a
lifejacket, would you grab it?'' '' Yes!''

1292
01:19:57,120 --> 01:19:59,873  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
''Good. Pick up 200 shares.
l won't let you down.''

1293
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:03,037  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Ask 'em how they'd like to see
30, 40% returns.

1294
01:20:03,160 --> 01:20:04,957  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
What are they gonna say?
''No''? ''Fuck you''?

1295
01:20:05,080 --> 01:20:08,356  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
''l don't wanna see those returns''?
Stop laughing. it's not funny.

1296
01:20:08,480 --> 01:20:12,393  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
lf you can't learn to close, you better
start thinking about another career.

1297
01:20:12,520 --> 01:20:15,398  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
And l am deadly serious about that.
Dead fuckin' serious!

1298
01:20:15,520 --> 01:20:17,317  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
And have your rebuttals ready.

1299
01:20:17,440 --> 01:20:19,795  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
A guy says, ''Call me tomorrow''?
Bull shit!

1300
01:20:19,920 --> 01:20:23,879  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Somebody tells you they got money
problems buying 200 shares is lying.

1301
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:25,991  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
You know what l say to that?

1302
01:20:26,120 --> 01:20:28,839  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
l say, ''Look, man.
Tell me you don't like my firm.

1303
01:20:28,960 --> 01:20:32,236  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Tell me you don't like my idea.
Tell me you don't like my necktie.

1304
01:20:32,360 --> 01:20:35,989  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
But don't tell me you can't
put together 2,500 bucks.''

1305
01:20:36,120 --> 01:20:39,157  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
And there is no such thing
as a no-sale call.

1306
01:20:39,280 --> 01:20:41,510  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
A sale is made
on every call you make.

1307
01:20:41,640 --> 01:20:46,430  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Either you sell the client some stock,
or he sells you on a reason he can't.

1308
01:20:46,560 --> 01:20:49,028  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Either way, a sale is made.

1309
01:20:49,160 --> 01:20:52,311  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
The only question is,
''Who's gonna close?'' You or him?

1310
01:20:52,440 --> 01:20:56,433  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
And be relentless.
That's it. I'm done.

1311
01:20:56,680 --> 01:20:59,752  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
When l say this man was a loser,
l was saying to myself...

1312
01:20:59,880 --> 01:21:02,599  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
''What are you doing getting
involved with a divorc?''

1313
01:21:02,720 --> 01:21:05,234  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
it didn't work the first time, it won't
work the second. That's your phone.

1314
01:21:05,360 --> 01:21:07,476  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
- l should let you go. I'll scoot.
- Yes?

1315
01:21:07,600 --> 01:21:10,353  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
- Hi, Harry. How you doing?
- Seth, did you get my calls?

1316
01:21:10,480 --> 01:21:12,550  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Yeah, I'm sorry.
it's just been crazy around here.

1317
01:21:12,680 --> 01:21:16,150  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
What's happening with Farrow Tech?
it's down five points.

1318
01:21:16,280 --> 01:21:19,431  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
l think we should--

1319
01:21:19,560 --> 01:21:21,915  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
- l wanna sell it.
- You wanna sell now? The stock's down.

1320
01:21:22,040 --> 01:21:24,270  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
You don't make money
buying high and selling low.

1321
01:21:24,440 --> 01:21:28,831  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
So what's going on?
Tell me why we shouldn't get out now.

1322
01:21:28,960 --> 01:21:30,518  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
All right. Here's the deal.

1323
01:21:30,640 --> 01:21:33,154  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
l told you things would happen
in 60 days. it's only been 20 so far.

1324
01:21:33,280 --> 01:21:36,033  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
The situation here is explosive,
and l wanted to get you involved.

1325
01:21:36,160 --> 01:21:41,029  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
I've been busy gathering information.
The stock's down for tech reasons.

1326
01:21:41,160 --> 01:21:43,720  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
lt just came off the restricted list,
but it's still the same company.

1327
01:21:43,840 --> 01:21:47,799  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
As a matter off act, Farrow's been doing
nothing but signing more contracts.

1328
01:21:47,920 --> 01:21:50,434  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
- it's looking like our next big one.
- Guys, listen up.

1329
01:21:51,680 --> 01:21:53,796  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Harry, I'm sorry.
Can you hold on a second?

1330
01:21:53,920 --> 01:21:56,878  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Hey! Shut the fuck up!

1331
01:21:57,000 --> 01:21:58,399  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
l just got word from Michael.

1332
01:21:58,520 --> 01:22:00,192  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
The rip on Farrow Tech
is now three dollars.

1333
01:22:02,680 --> 01:22:04,989  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Harry, listen to this.

1334
01:22:07,000 --> 01:22:09,309  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Jesus Christ.
What's going on over there?

1335
01:22:09,440 --> 01:22:12,193  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
See what I'm saying? People know!
The whole place is going nuts.

1336
01:22:12,320 --> 01:22:16,029  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
it's already up a point, and it just
came off the restricted list.

1337
01:22:16,160 --> 01:22:19,436  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
I'm advising all my clients
to get in on this, and heavy.

1338
01:22:19,520 --> 01:22:22,159  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
You get the same stock we picked up
at eight, only now it's at four.

1339
01:22:22,280 --> 01:22:25,317  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
-When it was at 8, l said it'd go to 20.
-Yes, you did.

1340
01:22:25,440 --> 01:22:28,193  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
it's still going there, probably higher.
This doesn't change anything...

1341
01:22:28,320 --> 01:22:30,436  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
except you're making more money
than you did before.

1342
01:22:30,560 --> 01:22:32,596  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
l liked it at eight. l love it at four.
it's an average down for you.

1343
01:22:32,720 --> 01:22:34,711  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
- A what?
- it's called dollar-cost averaging.

1344
01:22:34,840 --> 01:22:37,718  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
lf you own 1 00 shares at 1 0 dollars,
and you pick up another 1 00 at 5...

1345
01:22:37,840 --> 01:22:39,751  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
that's 200 shares
at 7.50 a share.

1346
01:22:39,880 --> 01:22:41,757  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
lf l get you involved at 1 0,
l take you out at 1 5...

1347
01:22:41,880 --> 01:22:43,472  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
how many points did l make you?

1348
01:22:43,600 --> 01:22:45,909  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
- Five.
- Exactly. But at seven and a half..

1349
01:22:46,040 --> 01:22:47,837  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
if l take you out at 1 5,
that's 7 1 /2 points.

1350
01:22:47,960 --> 01:22:50,474  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
- That's better, isn't it?
- Yeah, but l--

1351
01:22:50,600 --> 01:22:52,591  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Let me close the door
to my office. One second.

1352
01:22:55,160 --> 01:22:58,675  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
l also have a bullet on it.
A few days ago, Dan Dorfman on CNBC...

1353
01:22:58,800 --> 01:23:01,360  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
put a heavy buy recommendation
on Farrow Tech.

1354
01:23:01,480 --> 01:23:05,189  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Listen to me. l just called
a broker friend at another firm...

1355
01:23:05,320 --> 01:23:08,471  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
and had him pick me up 50,000 shares
under my sister-in-law's name.

1356
01:23:08,600 --> 01:23:11,194  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
I'm gonna put all my kids
through college with this stock.

1357
01:23:11,320 --> 01:23:13,788  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
l have 1 ,000 more calls to make.

1358
01:23:13,920 --> 01:23:17,595  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
l have to call every one of my clients
and give'em the same opportunity.

1359
01:23:17,720 --> 01:23:19,995  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
You remember when we first spoke?
l told you that this firm...

1360
01:23:20,120 --> 01:23:21,917  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
only has six or seven
great ideas a year?

1361
01:23:22,040 --> 01:23:24,110  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Well, this is one
Of those ideas.

1362
01:23:24,240 --> 01:23:26,959  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
l remember you saying something
about wanting to buy a house, right?

1363
01:23:27,080 --> 01:23:27,990  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Yeah.

1364
01:23:28,120 --> 01:23:31,635  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
How'd you like topay for it
tomorrow in cash?

1365
01:23:32,760 --> 01:23:35,718  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
- Are you serious?
- Serious as cancer.

1366
01:23:37,200 --> 01:23:39,475  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Okay, all l have is...

1367
01:23:39,600 --> 01:23:42,592  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
the 50,000
from our savings account.

1368
01:23:44,200 --> 01:23:47,317  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Seth, you got a call
on line three.

1369
01:23:47,440 --> 01:23:50,955  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Look, that's my secretary.
l have to go.

1370
01:23:52,840 --> 01:23:54,671  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
What's it gonna be,
Harry?

1371
01:24:00,960 --> 01:24:03,269  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
This kid is really good.

1372
01:24:05,520 --> 01:24:07,317  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
God, he's gonna
go down hard.

1373
01:24:07,440 --> 01:24:09,874  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
You think l wanna live in this apartment
the rest of my life?

1374
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:11,592  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Sometimes l wonder.

1375
01:24:11,680 --> 01:24:13,671  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
I'm the one that got the raise.
Try and remember that.

1376
01:24:13,800 --> 01:24:17,713  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
- I'm the one that goes out every day--
- You can't keep using that.

1377
01:24:17,840 --> 01:24:19,990  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
I've told you a million times
that l will get a job.

1378
01:24:20,120 --> 01:24:22,076  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
But you forbid it,
then you use it against me.

1379
01:24:22,200 --> 01:24:23,679  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
We'll buy the house!

1380
01:24:23,800 --> 01:24:25,597  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
With what?
That was our savings, remember?

1381
01:24:25,720 --> 01:24:28,188  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
The stock's gonna go up!
Seth promised!

1382
01:24:28,320 --> 01:24:30,788  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
No, get out of it.
Sell it all tomorrow morning.

1383
01:24:42,200 --> 01:24:45,909  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
l spoke to Howard Goldberg
over at Prudential.

1384
01:24:46,040 --> 01:24:50,033  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
You lied again,
you unbelievable piece of shit.

1385
01:24:50,160 --> 01:24:53,072  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
You lied to all of us.

1386
01:24:53,200 --> 01:24:55,509  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
He told me
About J.T. Marlin.

1387
01:24:57,680 --> 01:25:00,194  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
it's a chop shop, Seth.

1388
01:25:00,320 --> 01:25:04,199  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
You've been selling
their shit all this time.

1389
01:25:04,320 --> 01:25:07,517  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
How many people have you fucked over?
Tell me. How many?

1390
01:25:07,640 --> 01:25:09,437  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
All that bullshit
about them...

1391
01:25:09,560 --> 01:25:11,516  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
wanting you to know
how the business works.

1392
01:25:11,640 --> 01:25:14,108  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
The great training programme,
remember?

1393
01:25:14,240 --> 01:25:18,392  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
All the profits you made
For your customers?

1394
01:25:18,520 --> 01:25:22,911  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Did you do anything for them?
Did you make them any money at all?

1395
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:28,639  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Oh, God. I'm done with you, Seth.
This is it. I've had it.

1396
01:25:28,760 --> 01:25:30,876  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
l don't wanna
see you again.

1397
01:25:32,440 --> 01:25:36,149  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
l don't want you to come to the house.
l don't want you to call.

1398
01:25:36,280 --> 01:25:40,034  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
This is worse than the casino.
You've been stealing.

1399
01:25:42,200 --> 01:25:44,031  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Look at me.

1400
01:25:45,160 --> 01:25:47,913  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
You're destroying
people's lives.

1401
01:25:53,240 --> 01:25:55,629  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
I'm telling you,
he's about to make a move.

1402
01:25:55,760 --> 01:25:59,309  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
No! l can't afford
to leave him out there any longer.

1403
01:25:59,440 --> 01:26:01,908  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
This girlfriend of his may have
already tipped him off.

1404
01:26:02,040 --> 01:26:04,759  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
- He could run at any time.
- She hasn't, sir.

1405
01:26:04,880 --> 01:26:06,677  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
How could you
possibly know that?

1406
01:26:06,800 --> 01:26:10,554  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
And if you're right
and she's so loyal to you...

1407
01:26:10,680 --> 01:26:13,638  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
then why hasn't she given us
any information yet?

1408
01:26:13,760 --> 01:26:17,070  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
l want Davis brought in
by the end of the week. Period.

1409
01:26:17,200 --> 01:26:21,079  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
There'll be a lot of heat coming down
'cause of what Farrow Tech did.

1410
01:26:21,200 --> 01:26:22,997  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
So be smart on the phone.
Calm people down.

1411
01:26:23,120 --> 01:26:25,998  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
The stocks dropped 86%
from yesterday's close.

1412
01:26:26,120 --> 01:26:28,429  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
l don't want people dumping
their shares, understand?

1413
01:26:28,560 --> 01:26:31,472  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Isaac, l got a Mr Klastow.
He's super hot.

1414
01:26:31,600 --> 01:26:33,477  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Fuck! l gotta deal
with this guy now?

1415
01:26:35,840 --> 01:26:37,876  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
You wanna transfer
your account out? Go ahead.

1416
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:39,991  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
You're gonna transfer to some broker
who doesn't owe you shit.

1417
01:26:40,120 --> 01:26:43,237  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
I'm sorry we couldn't foresee this when
we first came to you with the stock.

1418
01:26:43,360 --> 01:26:44,156  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
l lost you $60,000.

1419
01:26:44,280 --> 01:26:47,397  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
There is no one who wants to make
that money back for you more than l.

1420
01:26:47,520 --> 01:26:50,159  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
When's the last time
you closed something?

1421
01:26:50,280 --> 01:26:52,396  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
You couldn't close
a fuckin' window, you moron!

1422
01:26:55,920 --> 01:26:58,912  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
What the fuck is this?
What is this?

1423
01:26:59,040 --> 01:27:00,792  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
You think I'm gonna sign
a sell ticket for you?

1424
01:27:00,920 --> 01:27:03,150  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
What'd l just say?

1425
01:27:03,280 --> 01:27:05,430  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Get him back on the phone
and explain the situation to him.

1426
01:27:05,560 --> 01:27:09,997  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Get on the phone! No one is gonna
unload today, you hear me? No one.

1427
01:27:12,600 --> 01:27:14,158  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
You're a mutt.

1428
01:27:14,280 --> 01:27:16,714  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Seth, I've got a Harry Reynard
on the phone.

1429
01:27:16,840 --> 01:27:19,718  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Yeah, put him through.

1430
01:27:21,720 --> 01:27:24,518  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
- Hi, Harry. I was gonna call you.
- l want my money back.

1431
01:27:24,640 --> 01:27:26,437  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
- Look, Harry,
- l know you're pissed.

1432
01:27:26,560 --> 01:27:30,155  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
We had a setback, but don't worry.
it's become a gold stock.

1433
01:27:30,240 --> 01:27:33,710  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
I plan to bring you eight or nine points
Over the course of this year.

1434
01:27:33,840 --> 01:27:36,400  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
People are talking about it
like it's the next Microsoft.

1435
01:27:36,520 --> 01:27:40,354  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Listen, I'm in a heap of trouble here.
l need that money back.

1436
01:27:40,480 --> 01:27:43,233  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
it was supposed to be a down payment
for a house for my family...

1437
01:27:43,360 --> 01:27:45,157  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
and now we're gonna
lose the house.

1438
01:27:45,280 --> 01:27:48,511  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
- It's gonna rebound.
- Seth, l need the money back!

1439
01:27:48,640 --> 01:27:50,870  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
I'm sorry, Harry.
l can't do that.

1440
01:27:51,000 --> 01:27:53,560  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Please, Seth,
l need the money back!

1441
01:27:53,680 --> 01:27:56,148  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
l have to go.

1442
01:27:56,280 --> 01:27:58,953  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Hello? Hello?

1443
01:28:01,280 --> 01:28:03,714  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
lf he calls back,
I'm not here.

1444
01:28:12,680 --> 01:28:14,398  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
J.T. Marlin.

1445
01:28:14,520 --> 01:28:16,272  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
- Seth Davis.
- May I ask who's calling?

1446
01:28:16,400 --> 01:28:19,676  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
- it's Harry Reynard.
- He just stepped out for a meeting.

1447
01:28:19,800 --> 01:28:23,110  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Oh, God! Damn it!

1448
01:28:33,400 --> 01:28:36,949  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
I wish my dad could've stepped
into the casino just once.

1449
01:28:37,080 --> 01:28:38,877  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
He would've had
to be impressed.

1450
01:28:39,000 --> 01:28:43,755  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Four employees, an organized payroll,
huge client list.

1451
01:28:43,880 --> 01:28:46,872  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
It's funny looking back.
The illegal business I was running...

1452
01:28:47,000 --> 01:28:49,434  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
was the most legitimate thing
I had going.

1453
01:28:49,560 --> 01:28:54,634  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
I looked my customers in the eye
And provided a service they wanted.

1454
01:28:54,760 --> 01:28:57,513  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Now, I don't even
look at my customers...

1455
01:28:57,640 --> 01:29:01,633  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
and I push them something
they never asked for.

1456
01:29:07,960 --> 01:29:09,996  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
What are you
doing here, Seth?

1457
01:29:10,120 --> 01:29:12,953  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
l thought l told you
l didn't want to see you again.

1458
01:29:13,080 --> 01:29:15,036  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
l need to talk to you.

1459
01:29:15,160 --> 01:29:17,390  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
What is it?

1460
01:29:17,520 --> 01:29:19,431  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
l want out of the firm.

1461
01:29:19,520 --> 01:29:21,590  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Great. Leave. l don't care
what you do any more.

1462
01:29:21,720 --> 01:29:24,518  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
I'll tell you this, your coming here
is unacceptable to me.

1463
01:29:24,640 --> 01:29:26,949  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
- Do you want to cost me my judgeship?
- No.

1464
01:29:27,080 --> 01:29:28,559  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
l can't have any connection to you.

1465
01:29:28,680 --> 01:29:32,229  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
l wanna get out of the firm
like you told me to.

1466
01:29:32,360 --> 01:29:34,351  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
- l just need your help.
- What do you need my help for?

1467
01:29:34,480 --> 01:29:37,119  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
You're getting out.
Fine. Whatever.

1468
01:29:37,240 --> 01:29:40,357  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
l don't care if you stay there or not.
Just get out of here!

1469
01:29:41,880 --> 01:29:43,359  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
l wanted to--

1470
01:29:43,480 --> 01:29:46,836  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
There was this investment
that l wanted to tell you about.

1471
01:29:46,960 --> 01:29:49,713  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Oh, Seth. Please.
You've gotta be kidding me.

1472
01:29:49,840 --> 01:29:52,912  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
No-- l mean,
you can make a lot of money.

1473
01:29:53,040 --> 01:29:56,953  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
- Seth, you listen to me--
- We could make a couple big trades...

1474
01:29:57,080 --> 01:30:00,709  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
that J.T. Marlin
wants you to invest in...

1475
01:30:00,840 --> 01:30:04,037  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
and then when
the next I.P.O. comes out--

1476
01:30:04,160 --> 01:30:07,516  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
No, stop. Are you asking me
to go in on a stock scam with you?

1477
01:30:07,640 --> 01:30:11,713  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
What, are you out of your fucking mind?
Are you nuts? Listen.

1478
01:30:11,840 --> 01:30:14,479  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
l think it's time
for you to--

1479
01:30:23,960 --> 01:30:26,076  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Do you remember this day?

1480
01:30:26,200 --> 01:30:27,997  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Yes, of course.
l bought you that bike.

1481
01:30:28,120 --> 01:30:31,954  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Do you remember what happened
about a month after that?

1482
01:30:32,080 --> 01:30:34,310  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
All right. What is it?
What do you want from me?

1483
01:30:34,440 --> 01:30:37,989  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Do you remember when l broke--
when l broke my leg?

1484
01:30:38,120 --> 01:30:40,395  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Yes, Seth, l remember
you broke your leg.

1485
01:30:42,400 --> 01:30:45,676  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
What is it? You were hysterical!
l had to get you to stop!

1486
01:30:47,720 --> 01:30:50,280  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
My fucking leg...

1487
01:30:50,400 --> 01:30:52,550  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
was broken.

1488
01:30:52,680 --> 01:30:55,274  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
I'm sorry--
I'm sorry l couldn't...

1489
01:30:55,400 --> 01:30:57,595  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
get the job
that you wanted me to have.

1490
01:30:57,720 --> 01:31:01,759  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
But-- l mean--
Who gives a shit?

1491
01:31:01,880 --> 01:31:04,440  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
'Cause I'm good
at what l do, Dad.

1492
01:31:04,560 --> 01:31:07,313  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
I'm good at what l do!

1493
01:31:07,440 --> 01:31:11,752  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
And the casino--
The casino was a fucking business...

1494
01:31:11,880 --> 01:31:14,917  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
and l ran it
pretty fuckin' well, Dad!

1495
01:31:15,040 --> 01:31:17,998  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
- And to think that l closed it for you!
- Wait, wait.

1496
01:31:18,120 --> 01:31:20,031  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Wait.
When did you close it?

1497
01:31:20,160 --> 01:31:24,517  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
And then l got this job 'cause l thought
it was what you wanted me to be doing!

1498
01:31:24,640 --> 01:31:26,835  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Seth, wait a second.
When did you close it?

1499
01:31:26,960 --> 01:31:31,397  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
And l tried-- l tried to make
the changes that you wanted me to!

1500
01:31:31,520 --> 01:31:33,795  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
And I'm leaving J.T. now!

1501
01:31:33,920 --> 01:31:38,232  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
I'm just asking you for this one thing.
Just this one thing, please!

1502
01:31:38,360 --> 01:31:41,033  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Help your son!

1503
01:31:44,800 --> 01:31:47,758  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
l can't, Seth.
l can't. I'm sorry.

1504
01:32:04,080 --> 01:32:06,435  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
What are you
gonna do now?

1505
01:32:06,560 --> 01:32:09,632  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
I'm still gonna do it.
l have a friend that'll go in with me.

1506
01:32:09,760 --> 01:32:12,274  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
lf l do it right,
l can take J.T. for at least 300 grand.

1507
01:32:12,400 --> 01:32:14,630  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
- My father can go to hell.
- Seth, my mom.

1508
01:32:14,760 --> 01:32:18,753  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
- I'm sorry.
- l don't think you should do it.

1509
01:32:18,840 --> 01:32:21,274  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
- l think you should just quit.
- l told you...

1510
01:32:21,400 --> 01:32:23,311  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
I've invested
too much time in this.

1511
01:32:23,440 --> 01:32:25,237  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
l have no more money
coming in any more...

1512
01:32:25,360 --> 01:32:27,749  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
because Jeff tanked
my fucking gold mine.

1513
01:32:27,880 --> 01:32:29,677  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
l need this.

1514
01:32:29,800 --> 01:32:32,792  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
l could hook you up with my friend
that works over at Smith Barney.

1515
01:32:32,920 --> 01:32:35,309  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
- l know you can get a job there.
- Doing what? Ticket running?

1516
01:32:35,440 --> 01:32:40,275  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
You think coming from J.T. Marlin,
they'll let me trade? No fuckin' way.

1517
01:32:40,400 --> 01:32:44,757  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Why are you so against this?
What do you care if l pull this off?

1518
01:32:44,880 --> 01:32:47,269  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
This is gonna be great
for both of us.

1519
01:32:58,640 --> 01:33:01,791  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Seth, l just have
a bad feeling about all this.

1520
01:33:03,240 --> 01:33:05,595  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
- l gotta go.
- Seth, l need to talk to you.

1521
01:33:05,720 --> 01:33:07,597  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
I've just got to
figure something out.

1522
01:33:07,720 --> 01:33:09,517  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
l need to tell you something.
Please don't walk out.

1523
01:33:09,640 --> 01:33:11,915  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Abby, can you come in here
for a second?

1524
01:33:12,040 --> 01:33:16,716  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Yeah, Mom, one sec--
Seth. Fuck.

1525
01:33:16,840 --> 01:33:19,115  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Mommy, what's going on?

1526
01:33:20,320 --> 01:33:22,595  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Okay. Get that. Let's go.

1527
01:33:22,720 --> 01:33:25,314  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
- Mom, where are we going?
- Let's just go.

1528
01:33:34,680 --> 01:33:36,910  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Yeah, l know.

1529
01:33:37,040 --> 01:33:40,510  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
You went too far this time.

1530
01:33:40,640 --> 01:33:45,430  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Well, then, when you'd figured it out,
you should've said something.

1531
01:33:45,560 --> 01:33:48,472  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
No, he certainly
hasn't helped any.

1532
01:33:52,240 --> 01:33:55,357  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
But he loves you, Seth.

1533
01:33:55,480 --> 01:33:57,436  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Do you know that?

1534
01:33:57,560 --> 01:34:00,358  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
it's important
that you know that.

1535
01:34:09,040 --> 01:34:10,109  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Line three.

1536
01:34:15,000 --> 01:34:17,958  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
- Seth Davis here.
- Hi, Seth. How are you?

1537
01:34:19,800 --> 01:34:22,872  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
- Dad?
- Yep.

1538
01:34:23,000 --> 01:34:26,356  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Listen, can l change your mind
about doing this I.P.O. scheme?

1539
01:34:26,480 --> 01:34:29,199  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
No, I'm sorry.

1540
01:34:29,320 --> 01:34:31,629  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
I've already gone in
with somebody.

1541
01:34:31,760 --> 01:34:34,320  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Well, then, I'm gonna
help you out with this.

1542
01:34:34,440 --> 01:34:37,238  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
You're gonna do it with me?

1543
01:34:37,360 --> 01:34:39,157  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
No, Seth.
You know l can't do that...

1544
01:34:39,280 --> 01:34:41,510  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
but at least l can make sure
you don't get caught.

1545
01:34:41,640 --> 01:34:44,108  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
I know somebody
Over at Ellis Proud...

1546
01:34:44,240 --> 01:34:46,595  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
and they can talk to you
about it.

1547
01:34:46,720 --> 01:34:50,633  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
So, why don't you come over
to the house tomorrow night?

1548
01:34:50,760 --> 01:34:52,716  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Thank you, Dad.
I'm so glad you called.

1549
01:34:52,840 --> 01:34:54,831  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Me too.

1550
01:34:54,960 --> 01:34:57,599  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Okay, kiddo.
Tomorrow night.

1551
01:34:57,720 --> 01:34:59,438  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Okay.

1552
01:35:06,520 --> 01:35:09,876  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
So, do you wanna
talk to me, or-- l mean--

1553
01:35:11,120 --> 01:35:13,429  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
l don't know
what to tell you.

1554
01:35:13,560 --> 01:35:16,916  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Let's think about this whole thing.
Lf you pull this I.P.O. deal off...

1555
01:35:17,040 --> 01:35:19,873  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
and I'm associated with you,
what do you think will happen to me?

1556
01:35:20,000 --> 01:35:23,037  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
- But they can't prove anything.
- Who says they have to?

1557
01:35:23,160 --> 01:35:27,278  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
I'm gonna lose my job unless l put
some distance between us right now.

1558
01:35:27,400 --> 01:35:31,109  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Who cares about that?
I'm gonna take care of you.

1559
01:35:31,240 --> 01:35:35,597  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Look, you are the one real thing
in my life right now.

1560
01:35:36,880 --> 01:35:40,759  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Get out of the car, please.

1561
01:35:40,880 --> 01:35:45,670  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
You are under arrest for violation
of 26 S.E.C. and N.A.S.D. regulations.

1562
01:35:45,800 --> 01:35:48,155  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
What the hell is going on
out here?

1563
01:35:48,280 --> 01:35:50,589  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Seth, I'm gonna get you
out of this.

1564
01:35:50,720 --> 01:35:54,952  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
-Just don't call my father.
- Get back in the car, Abby.

1565
01:36:07,160 --> 01:36:09,754  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Why is he here right now?
He didn't do anything.

1566
01:36:09,880 --> 01:36:11,836  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Seth, what the hell
is going on?

1567
01:36:11,960 --> 01:36:15,032  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
- You've been talking to them about me.
- Of course not!

1568
01:36:15,160 --> 01:36:18,357  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
- What is he doing here right now?
- Seth, are you sure?

1569
01:36:18,480 --> 01:36:22,598  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Of course I'm sure.
l didn't say anything.

1570
01:36:22,720 --> 01:36:25,188  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
All right. That's it.
l am out of here in three seconds...

1571
01:36:25,320 --> 01:36:27,834  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
unless you can
charge me with something.

1572
01:36:29,560 --> 01:36:33,269  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Can I change your mind
about doing the I.P. O. scheme?

1573
01:36:33,400 --> 01:36:37,075  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Well, then I'm gonna help you out.
I know somebody over at Ellis Proud.

1574
01:36:37,200 --> 01:36:39,270  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
At last I can make sure
you don't get caught.

1575
01:36:41,840 --> 01:36:43,637  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Oh, my God.

1576
01:36:43,760 --> 01:36:46,957  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
So, what
Do you want from me?

1577
01:36:47,080 --> 01:36:49,036  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
l want you to testify.

1578
01:36:49,160 --> 01:36:53,153  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
- Well, what are you offering?
- Full immunity.

1579
01:36:53,240 --> 01:36:58,553  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
- And what happens with my father?
- He won't do any time.

1580
01:36:58,680 --> 01:37:01,240  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Seth, l haven't done
anything illegal.

1581
01:37:01,360 --> 01:37:03,430  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
So, what's the deal, then?

1582
01:37:03,560 --> 01:37:06,870  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
The deal is l lose my judgeship
just going along for the ride.

1583
01:37:07,000 --> 01:37:10,913  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
- l have nothing to do with that.
- What's that supposed to mean?

1584
01:37:11,040 --> 01:37:12,996  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Are you gonna release the tape
to the press?

1585
01:37:13,120 --> 01:37:16,157  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Makes your case more glamorous
with the involvement of a federal judge.

1586
01:37:16,280 --> 01:37:19,670  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
- No. No, no. No deal.
- Why?

1587
01:37:19,800 --> 01:37:24,396  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
No, you take my father out the back,
and you bring him home.

1588
01:37:24,520 --> 01:37:26,954  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
He has nothing
to do with this case.

1589
01:37:27,080 --> 01:37:31,073  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
l swear to God, if he ends up
in one newspaper, l do not testify.

1590
01:37:31,200 --> 01:37:33,839  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
And l mean that.

1591
01:37:33,960 --> 01:37:36,474  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
For me, it'd be worth
going to jail for.

1592
01:37:36,600 --> 01:37:39,910  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
- You serious?
- What do you think?

1593
01:37:43,640 --> 01:37:48,430  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Before we get ahead of ourselves,
just what are you offering?

1594
01:37:48,560 --> 01:37:52,155  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
l'm gonna hand you this case
on a silver fucking platter.

1595
01:37:52,280 --> 01:37:55,750  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
l know everything you don't.
l know how it all works.

1596
01:37:55,880 --> 01:37:58,075  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
I know how Michael
Makes his money.

1597
01:37:58,200 --> 01:38:00,111  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
I know how he hides it.

1598
01:38:00,240 --> 01:38:02,674  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
I know who he goes in with.

1599
01:38:02,800 --> 01:38:06,190  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
I even know where he moves
If you guys get too close.

1600
01:38:06,320 --> 01:38:08,959  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
l know everything!

1601
01:38:09,080 --> 01:38:11,640  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
So tell me what happens now.

1602
01:38:11,760 --> 01:38:14,911  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
You go back to work tomorrow
like nothing happened, for one day.

1603
01:38:15,040 --> 01:38:19,318  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
l need your client book and your whole
''C'' drive backed up onto floppy.

1604
01:38:25,000 --> 01:38:28,436  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
- And we have to hold you overnight.
-Just a minute, please.

1605
01:38:28,560 --> 01:38:32,712  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Please, l want a couple of moments
alone with my son.

1606
01:38:32,840 --> 01:38:35,877  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
- I'm sorry--
- David, let's give them a moment.

1607
01:38:49,560 --> 01:38:53,189  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
l am so sorry.
l am so fuckin' sorry.

1608
01:38:55,240 --> 01:38:59,711  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Seth, just let me speak.

1609
01:39:01,120 --> 01:39:04,829  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
When l came up to you
behind that car...

1610
01:39:04,960 --> 01:39:07,315  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
it was the hardest thing
l ever had to bear...

1611
01:39:07,440 --> 01:39:11,433  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
because all l wanted to do
was make your pain disappear.

1612
01:39:16,920 --> 01:39:20,390  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
l don't even know how
to describe the feeling.

1613
01:39:27,000 --> 01:39:29,355  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
l just want you
to know one thing.

1614
01:39:31,080 --> 01:39:35,870  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Not a day of my life has gone by
that l don't think about that moment...

1615
01:39:36,000 --> 01:39:39,959  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
that l don't dream about being back
there just to have one more chance.

1616
01:39:44,160 --> 01:39:46,993  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
l am more sorry
than you will ever know.

1617
01:40:02,400 --> 01:40:07,315  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
You know that E!'s got
that bathing suit thing going.

1618
01:40:07,440 --> 01:40:09,476  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
French Riviera.
it's on tonight.

1619
01:40:09,600 --> 01:40:13,195  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
The guy was an idiot. He acted like
he was from Staten Island. No--

1620
01:40:13,320 --> 01:40:17,029  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Hi, you've reached the Reynards.
Please leave a message.

1621
01:40:17,160 --> 01:40:19,196  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Thanks. Have a nice day.

1622
01:40:19,320 --> 01:40:21,311  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Hey, Harry.
it's Seth Davis.

1623
01:40:21,440 --> 01:40:23,556  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
- Are you there?
- Isaac, your mother on line three.

1624
01:40:23,680 --> 01:40:27,389  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
You know, about the way
things went, l just--

1625
01:40:30,320 --> 01:40:32,515  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
l found a way
to get your money back.

1626
01:40:32,640 --> 01:40:34,631  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
l just need you
to call me back, all right?

1627
01:40:34,720 --> 01:40:37,393  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
George, get me a coffee.
Thanks.

1628
01:40:37,520 --> 01:40:39,317  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
So call me.

1629
01:40:55,440 --> 01:40:57,192  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
What?

1630
01:40:57,320 --> 01:41:00,869  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
- Hi.
- What's up?

1631
01:41:01,000 --> 01:41:04,276  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
- l want to talk to you about a client.
- Yeah.

1632
01:41:04,400 --> 01:41:07,710  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
- His name is Harry Reynard.
- l don't know him.

1633
01:41:09,200 --> 01:41:11,111  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
l think you should,
because we're about to lose him.

1634
01:41:11,240 --> 01:41:14,835  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
He dropped $50,000 on
Farrow Tech this week alone.

1635
01:41:14,960 --> 01:41:16,075  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
And you want to do what?

1636
01:41:16,200 --> 01:41:19,192  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
l want to keep him here.

1637
01:41:19,320 --> 01:41:23,472  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
l think that we should give him
a chunk of the Med Patent I.P.O.

1638
01:41:23,600 --> 01:41:25,750  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
We don't hand out I.P.O. to somebody
who had a bad day on the market.

1639
01:41:25,880 --> 01:41:28,713  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Look, Michael, this guy
is a fucking whale...

1640
01:41:28,840 --> 01:41:31,115  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
and he's gonna do an obscene amount
of business with this firm.

1641
01:41:31,240 --> 01:41:34,676  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
- You're somehow sure of this.
- Yeah, the guy completely trusts me.

1642
01:41:34,800 --> 01:41:36,791  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
He doesn't even need the money.

1643
01:41:36,920 --> 01:41:39,150  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
He owns the biggest
foods company in Wisconsin.

1644
01:41:39,280 --> 01:41:40,998  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
He just wants to know
we're gonna do right by him.

1645
01:41:41,120 --> 01:41:42,599  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
How many trades has he made?

1646
01:41:44,280 --> 01:41:45,713  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Two.

1647
01:41:45,840 --> 01:41:48,593  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
But he made a second trade
a week after l opened him.

1648
01:41:48,720 --> 01:41:51,871  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Look, the guy's pretty fuckin'
sour on Farrow Tech...

1649
01:41:52,000 --> 01:41:53,115  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
and he's gonna walk.

1650
01:41:53,240 --> 01:41:56,915  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
l just think we need to make him
a little money on this next I.P.O....

1651
01:41:57,040 --> 01:41:58,837  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
and let him
take it for a ride.

1652
01:41:58,960 --> 01:42:01,030  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
What did Greg say?

1653
01:42:01,160 --> 01:42:04,436  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
He's busy closing somebody.
l didn't want to bother him.

1654
01:42:06,160 --> 01:42:07,912  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Well, go get him.

1655
01:42:11,160 --> 01:42:14,357  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Hey, Greg.
Michael wants to see you.

1656
01:42:26,720 --> 01:42:29,712  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
l don't know what he told you,
but I've had it with this shit.

1657
01:42:29,840 --> 01:42:34,516  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
This is a business, all right?
He should be making calls...

1658
01:42:34,640 --> 01:42:38,633  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
not in here bitching about
personal petty shit between me and him.

1659
01:42:38,760 --> 01:42:41,718  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Seth was talking about giving
Med Patent IP.O. to Harry Reynard.

1660
01:42:43,440 --> 01:42:45,237  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
What-- Are you
fucking kidding me?

1661
01:42:45,360 --> 01:42:47,749  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
First of all, l don't even
know this guy Reynard.

1662
01:42:47,880 --> 01:42:51,714  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
No way. He's totally unreliable.
What are you doing?

1663
01:42:51,800 --> 01:42:54,712  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Guy dropped 50 large
on Farrow Tech this week.

1664
01:42:54,840 --> 01:42:59,470  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
That's great. But l have lots of clients
who deserve I.P.O. more than this guy.

1665
01:42:59,600 --> 01:43:01,238  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Clients who've been
with me six months...

1666
01:43:01,360 --> 01:43:02,952  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
taken losses
and continue to trade.

1667
01:43:03,080 --> 01:43:06,152  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
- And he's one of'em, asshole.
- You see what I'm dealing with here?

1668
01:43:06,240 --> 01:43:09,835  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
- What do you mean, ''he's one of them''?
- He's one of Greg's clients.

1669
01:43:09,960 --> 01:43:11,109  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
What?

1670
01:43:11,240 --> 01:43:12,992  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
l opened him when l was
closing my 40 accounts for you.

1671
01:43:13,120 --> 01:43:15,076  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
I'm just his contact here.
He's your client.

1672
01:43:15,200 --> 01:43:17,077  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
I'm not gonna
make a dime off this trade.

1673
01:43:17,200 --> 01:43:18,872  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
No wonder the guy's pissed off.

1674
01:43:19,000 --> 01:43:21,195  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
His own broker doesn't even know
he's a fuckin' client here.

1675
01:43:24,160 --> 01:43:26,310  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Fine.

1676
01:43:26,440 --> 01:43:28,476  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Give him 1 0,000 shares.

1677
01:43:28,600 --> 01:43:31,160  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
He just can't sell it
before we say so.

1678
01:43:31,280 --> 01:43:34,238  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
- Great. Okay.
- No joke, Seth.

1679
01:43:34,360 --> 01:43:37,079  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
He cannot sell it
before we sell it.

1680
01:43:37,200 --> 01:43:40,510  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
- At least six months, you understand?
- Absolutely. Absolutely.

1681
01:43:40,640 --> 01:43:43,313  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Greg, I'm sure you don't
have a problem with this.

1682
01:43:43,440 --> 01:43:45,670  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Can you get the fuck
out of my office?

1683
01:43:45,800 --> 01:43:47,597  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Fine.

1684
01:43:51,840 --> 01:43:53,796  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
What the fuck are you doing?

1685
01:43:53,920 --> 01:43:56,753  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Stand up! You cannot sit down
for the rest of the fuckin' day!

1686
01:43:56,880 --> 01:44:00,759  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
You cannot sit down
ever again! Okay?

1687
01:44:03,600 --> 01:44:05,397  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Seth, line two.

1688
01:44:12,320 --> 01:44:15,517  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
- Hello?
- It's time, Seth.

1689
01:44:15,640 --> 01:44:17,471  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Get going.

1690
01:44:47,960 --> 01:44:49,791  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
I'm going to lunch, boys.

1691
01:45:05,640 --> 01:45:07,949  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
What's this about?
You okay?

1692
01:45:08,080 --> 01:45:13,552  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
l need you to sign a sell ticket
for a client of mine.

1693
01:45:13,680 --> 01:45:15,671  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Fuck Greg!
Let's fuckin' deal with--

1694
01:45:15,800 --> 01:45:18,872  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
- Let's talk to Michael.
- No, wait. Wait, wait.

1695
01:45:19,000 --> 01:45:20,877  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Chris, l got arrested
last night.

1696
01:45:21,000 --> 01:45:23,150  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
What?

1697
01:45:23,280 --> 01:45:25,840  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
The F.B.I. arrested me.

1698
01:45:25,960 --> 01:45:28,758  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
The F.B.I.? Why the fuck
would the F.B.I. arrest you?

1699
01:45:28,880 --> 01:45:31,189  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Because of my involvement
in this firm.

1700
01:45:31,320 --> 01:45:35,074  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Your involvement in the firm?
What the fuck does that mean?

1701
01:45:35,200 --> 01:45:37,111  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Come on, Chris.
You know what that means.

1702
01:45:37,240 --> 01:45:39,310  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
No, l don't know what that means.
What does that mean?

1703
01:45:39,440 --> 01:45:42,876  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
- What the fuck did you tell 'em?
- No. No.

1704
01:45:43,000 --> 01:45:47,471  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
No, they knew everything, man.
They had photographs.

1705
01:45:47,600 --> 01:45:50,956  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
They had-- They had
tape-recorded conversations.

1706
01:45:51,080 --> 01:45:53,196  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
They brought my father in,
you know. l mean--

1707
01:45:53,320 --> 01:45:56,869  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
- Chris, there was nothing l could do.
- What did you do?

1708
01:45:57,000 --> 01:45:59,275  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Chris, the F.B.I. are gonna
raid the place in 20 minutes.

1709
01:45:59,400 --> 01:46:02,119  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
What the fuck
are you talking about?

1710
01:46:02,240 --> 01:46:04,310  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Fuck, Seth!

1711
01:46:04,440 --> 01:46:06,237  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Come on, man.

1712
01:46:06,360 --> 01:46:08,396  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
l asked you for months
about shit going down here...

1713
01:46:08,480 --> 01:46:10,311  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
and you told me
to shut the fuck up.

1714
01:46:10,400 --> 01:46:12,356  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
You said get ready
to be a millionaire!

1715
01:46:12,480 --> 01:46:15,119  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
That's right. Shut the fuck up.
That's all you had to do.

1716
01:46:15,200 --> 01:46:16,633  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Didn't you learn anything?

1717
01:46:16,760 --> 01:46:18,671  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
l learned how to fuck people
out of their money.

1718
01:46:19,960 --> 01:46:23,270  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Harry Reynard just lost
his life savings.

1719
01:46:23,400 --> 01:46:26,472  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
And he wasn't a whale.

1720
01:46:26,600 --> 01:46:31,720  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
He was just some poor schmuck,
and l took him.

1721
01:46:31,840 --> 01:46:35,435  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
l did everything that J.T. Marlin
taught me to do...

1722
01:46:35,560 --> 01:46:37,391  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
and l made up his mind
for him.

1723
01:46:37,520 --> 01:46:41,195  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
What do you want me to tell you?
That's what we do here.

1724
01:46:41,320 --> 01:46:44,198  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
What? We lie?
We're liars?

1725
01:46:45,240 --> 01:46:48,869  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Seth, this--

1726
01:46:53,760 --> 01:46:55,557  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Who are they coming for?

1727
01:46:55,680 --> 01:46:58,877  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
They're coming
for everybody, everything.

1728
01:47:01,600 --> 01:47:03,556  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
You know how hard l worked
to get where l am?

1729
01:47:03,680 --> 01:47:06,069  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
No, Chris, you need
to forget about that.

1730
01:47:06,200 --> 01:47:08,156  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
it doesn't mean shit.

1731
01:47:08,280 --> 01:47:10,874  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Right now at this moment
is what you should be thinking about.

1732
01:47:11,000 --> 01:47:13,639  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
What are you gonna do
in the next 1 5 minutes?

1733
01:47:13,720 --> 01:47:17,315  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
They're gonna come in here,
and make sure that we never trade...

1734
01:47:17,440 --> 01:47:19,670  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
another share of stock
for the rest of our lives.

1735
01:47:19,800 --> 01:47:23,759  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
- But we can do something.
- What's that?

1736
01:47:23,880 --> 01:47:26,474  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Harry, my client.

1737
01:47:26,600 --> 01:47:29,751  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
l need a senior broker
to sign a sell ticket...

1738
01:47:29,880 --> 01:47:31,598  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
so he can take his shares...

1739
01:47:31,720 --> 01:47:36,191  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
and dump'em on the open market
and make his money back.

1740
01:47:40,200 --> 01:47:43,431  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Come on, Chris. Come on.
What's the difference?

1741
01:47:43,560 --> 01:47:46,154  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Do one thing right here.

1742
01:47:47,240 --> 01:47:49,708  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Just sign it, please.

1743
01:47:57,200 --> 01:47:59,111  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Thank you, Chris.

1744
01:48:05,400 --> 01:48:08,676  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
I'm so sorry.

1745
01:48:30,360 --> 01:48:32,590  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
I'm plagued by ''what ifs''
these days.

1746
01:48:32,720 --> 01:48:35,871  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
What if Greg hadn 't
come over that night?

1747
01:48:36,000 --> 01:48:38,594  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
What if I hadn't
forgotten my bag...

1748
01:48:38,720 --> 01:48:41,234  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
or seen Michael walk
into the building that day?

1749
01:48:42,960 --> 01:48:46,077  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
What if I had
Skipped over Harry's card?

1750
01:48:46,200 --> 01:48:48,031  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
What are the chances?
What are the odds?

1751
01:48:48,160 --> 01:48:49,752  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
That's what I think about.

1752
01:48:49,880 --> 01:48:52,394  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
Hey, Iran a casino.

1753
01:48:54,640 --> 01:48:59,668  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
It's the next step I gotta figure out,
'cause I'm no lottery winner.

1754
01:48:59,800 --> 01:49:04,316  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
I tried slinging crack rock,
And I never had a jump shot.

1755
01:49:05,400 --> 01:49:08,198  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:054 Y2:574
I gotta find a job.
