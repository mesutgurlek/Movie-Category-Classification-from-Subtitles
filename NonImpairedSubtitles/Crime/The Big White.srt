1
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:45,435
Marcy. Call Mr. Barnell.

2
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:47,991
Tell him I picked up his wife again.

3
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:49,832
I'm bringing her in.

4
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:27,629
Need a hand?

5
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:31,310
Oh, yeah. You mind giving her a push?

6
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:32,151
Yeah.

7
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:33,595
Oh, great. Thanks.

8
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:35,279
- On three, then.
- Okay.

9
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:38,314
One, two, three.

10
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,275
Oh, that's great. Thanks.

11
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:46,630
I tell you, she may be fast,
but she sure ain't light.

12
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:47,277
Yeah.

13
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:50,039
You the new guy who just moved
into the Stevens' old house?

14
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:53,915
No. Name's Ted.
What is that, a Polaris?

15
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:55,149
Oh, yeah!

16
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:56,799
What do those things go for?

17
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:59,914
A lot more than I could normally
afford, I tell you.

18
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:02,915
What's that?

19
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:05,435
It's a video camera.

20
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:07,472
- Hey, is that thing heavy?
- Yeah.

21
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:09,232
And you got it in there by yourself?

22
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:11,639
How's that on your back?

23
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:12,870
Oh, no.

24
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:16,958
Oh, please! Turn the camera off!

25
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:20,391
Ted! Oh, that's not nice!

26
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:24,917
That was really cool.
It was like watching "Cops".

27
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:28,436
Yeah? Well, he was pretty spry
for a man with a herniated disk.

28
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:30,958
You know, I don't want
to bitch or anything,

29
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:33,514
but you were supposed to take
me along on that one.

30
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:35,199
Couldrt find you.

31
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:38,312
I know you know this but the sooner
they think I can handle things on my own,

32
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:40,198
the soonerthey'll kick
you back down south.

33
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:43,153
Yeah, well, I've been hearing that for
thirteen months and six days, Cam.

34
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:44,992
After a while, it gets a little old.

35
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,752
Claims. Watters.

36
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:54,155
Yeah. Okay.

37
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:10,799
That's quite the fish.

38
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:15,279
That one didn't get away.

39
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:18,551
Yeah, well... it's a nice catch.

40
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:21,995
This grasshopper walks in a bar.

41
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:25,630
And the bartender says,
"We have a drink named after you. "

42
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:26,710
And the grasshopper says...

43
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:28,438
Paul Barnell.

44
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:29,879
Ted Watters.

45
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:32,071
Mr. Watters.

46
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:33,116
Pleasure.

47
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:34,116
Mine, too.

48
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:39,918
Ted, Mr. Barnell would like to discuss
his brother's life insurance policy with us.

49
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:41,593
- Raymond, right?
- Yes.

50
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:44,838
Thing is, as I explained to Mr. Branch,

51
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:47,517
he's been gone for five years

52
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:52,156
and I thought, time to move on.

53
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:54,198
By move on, you mean?

54
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:56,116
I mean...

55
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:58,879
I think that cashing Raymond's policy.

56
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:03,470
I doubt, afterthat time,
that he's still alive.

57
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:07,315
And my father always wanted us
to take care of each other

58
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:09,755
if something should happen, and...

59
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:13,678
money is a little...

60
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:16,394
Yeah, I understand, Mr. Barnell.

61
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:17,993
But here's the thing.

62
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:21,835
With no actual body,
under Alaskan statutes,

63
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:24,269
a person has to be missing
for seven years

64
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:27,915
before he or she can be legally
declared dead.

65
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:31,231
And that's not withstanding
an investigation period

66
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:33,834
where concerned parties can take up
to another year

67
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:36,997
to file interventions
concerning the motion.

68
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:40,835
So, even though your brother's status
is undetermined at this point,

69
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:43,155
there's really very little we can do for you.

70
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:47,870
But we are extremely sorry for your loss.

71
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:50,948
Absolutely.

72
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:14,358
One, two, three...

73
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:20,074
All right. We'll get him later.

74
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:25,390
Yes, this is Mr. Barnell.

75
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:27,152
Mr. Barnell, this is John Hoag again

76
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:29,629
from Municipal Power's Delinquent
Accounts Department.

77
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:30,118
Excuse me?

78
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:31,275
I'm sorry, Mr. Barnell,

79
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:34,233
I've tried every other option and,
frankly, this is unavoidable.

80
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:36,274
Great.

81
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:37,390
Excuse me?

82
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:39,358
No, I'm not...

83
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:44,236
Hello?

84
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:46,832
Hello?

85
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:48,916
Yeah. I paid that bill a week ago.

86
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:49,637
You did?

87
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:51,438
I saw my secretary write it up.

88
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:53,869
Do you have any idea
where that payment might be?

89
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,673
I have no clue.

90
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:59,712
I'm a patient man, Mr. Barnell
but your credit rating is blocked off.

91
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:01,711
I have a very good credit rating.

92
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:03,629
No, you don't.

93
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:04,710
How do you know that?

94
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,958
I've got your TRW file in front of me, sir.

95
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:11,958
Mr. Barnell?

96
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:16,958
Mr. Barnell? Hello?

97
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:20,989
Mr. Barnell?

98
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:44,360
<i>Hey, kids, who's up fortrout?</i>

99
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:45,037
No.

100
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:35,470
Jodie, no! Not for dogs!

101
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:43,755
Honey, I'm home!

102
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:45,150
Any mail?

103
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:53,949
Psychic Pals.

104
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:56,676
How are you today, Mr. Williams?

105
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:01,719
Well, we are all registered psychics here.

106
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:02,312
Hi, Tiff.

107
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:05,836
I just had this feeling you needed to talk.
So what's up?

108
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:10,631
Your TV remote control?

109
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:14,111
Well, I need you to clear your
mind for a few moments.

110
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:17,438
It's stew. I don't think it's still good.

111
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:18,834
Hey, aren't you with a customer?

112
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:19,915
They're concentrating.

113
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:22,719
How is he the tea leaf business today?

114
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:26,509
I've decided, from now on, to ignore you
and your ignorance about my work.

115
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:29,276
And it's going very well, thank you.

116
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:33,871
Mr. Williams? I'm seeing sofa cushions.

117
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:38,039
Do you have a sofa?
Good! Glad I could help.

118
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:41,393
Okay, before you say anything else

119
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:44,120
that may keep us
from having sex ever again

120
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:45,910
let me ask you something.

121
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:47,593
No, I always get these wrong.

122
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:48,789
That's why we keep trying.

123
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:50,951
I don't want to do this.

124
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:53,915
Love Is Sacrifice quiz.

125
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:55,513
If you were in a life raft with me,

126
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:57,596
and there was only enough water for one...

127
00:13:57,720 --> 00:13:58,948
No, I'm not going to do it.

128
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:00,309
It's just a stupid quiz.

129
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:01,390
Exactly.

130
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:03,559
What is that?

131
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:06,039
I was just kidding.

132
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:13,834
Psychic Pals.

133
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:16,196
Is this the first time
you've called us, Mrs...

134
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:19,995
Stupid quizzes can be illustrative of
potential relationship problems.

135
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:23,597
Margaret, I'm getting the feeling this is
an anxious day for you.

136
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:26,314
Hey, you know our only relationship
problem is that you're running a dollar,

137
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:29,790
ninety-nine a minute carny scam
out of my living room.

138
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:31,639
Don't call it a scam.

139
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:35,595
Wait you didn't just call this
"your" living room, did you?

140
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:36,630
Ours.

141
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:41,351
Margaret, I feel someone you really care
about, maybe even the love of your life

142
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:44,233
is being a real pain.

143
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:48,313
Now, I need you to really concentrate
and I'll be right back.

144
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:54,520
I thought stuff didn't smell
when it was frozen.

145
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:55,868
I don't know why we have to...

146
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,230
'Cause Dave wants visual confirmation.

147
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:00,914
So Dave gets visual confirmation.

148
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:05,632
We have a chance to move up here, Gary,
so let's just do what we're told.

149
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:08,189
What's he gonna do, have him stuffed?

150
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:12,633
Like the guy's not gonna end up
in a landfill anyway.

151
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:14,711
You ever ask Dave what he did?

152
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:15,710
Who knows.

153
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:18,758
But Dave said if he did it one more time,
he was gonna break his neck.

154
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:23,675
So how did it feel?

155
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:27,154
I mean, not when you did it, but like now.

156
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:30,233
I don't want to talk about it.

157
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:32,195
Okay.

158
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:47,949
Jimbo! He's not here.

159
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:49,991
Gary, enough with the little jokes, okay?

160
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:52,073
I'm serious. He's gone.

161
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:55,598
Don't even joke about it.

162
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:57,233
Maybe he wasrt...

163
00:15:58,320 --> 00:15:59,230
dead.

164
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:06,278
Hey, Jimbo!
There's a little fridge down here.

165
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:22,912
Morning, Mr. Barnell.

166
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:23,717
Morning, Avis.

167
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:24,596
Coffee?

168
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:26,074
If you insist.

169
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:28,109
She looks good.

170
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:31,712
"Waikiki Airlines, yourticket to paradise. "

171
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:35,116
Was last Novemberthis bad?

172
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:38,753
If we didn't have the weather,
what would we talk about?

173
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:39,437
Yeah.

174
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:45,835
Messages?

175
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:49,437
Just that fellow from Municipal Power
and Electric.

176
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:51,391
I told him you sent the check in weeks ago,

177
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:53,869
but some people don't like to listen.

178
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,319
Sorry, what did you say?

179
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:03,950
Avis, something really spooky
happened last night.

180
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:05,912
You remember my brother Raymond?

181
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:07,229
The one who went missing?

182
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:12,190
Well, last night there
was a knock at the door

183
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:14,835
and behold, there was Raymond
on my doorstep.

184
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:16,473
Didrt you have him declared.

185
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:19,712
Dead? Well, no... yes. Well,

186
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:22,030
he was rtgone long enough really forthat.

187
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:23,991
Good thing. In hindsight.

188
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:26,628
So... where was he all these years?

189
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:30,120
Lower forty-eight. Didrt like the cold.

190
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:35,075
Well, that's great. You and Mrs. Barnell
will have some company for a bit, I guess.

191
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:38,309
How is she?

192
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:39,356
Better.

193
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:41,958
A little better, you know.

194
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:49,118
Collecting, Mrs. Barnell.

195
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:52,630
Daniel, you pussy little cocksucker.
I'll get my purse.

196
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:55,268
It's twelve dollars.
I missed you last time.

197
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:57,516
Jerk off. Jerk off.

198
00:17:57,960 --> 00:18:02,033
Jerk off. Jerk off, jerk off, jerk off.

199
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:10,038
Tell your slut mom I said hi.

200
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:11,718
Sure will. Thanks.

201
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:14,711
Some days are betterthan others.

202
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:17,390
Better.

203
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:18,755
Paul, why is the fridge
in the garage chained shut?

204
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:19,357
Possum.

205
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:20,595
Hot pussy?

206
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:22,358
Paul, dinner's almost ready.

207
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:25,153
Oh, I feel like some wine.
You feel like some wine?

208
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:29,836
You know, I have a crazy thought.

209
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:32,994
Let's order in tonight.

210
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:33,910
- Fuck it?
- Yeah.

211
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:34,990
- Okay.
- Yeah.

212
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:37,630
You know and I have to talk to you
about something.

213
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:39,515
Raymond's back.

214
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:07,236
And here he is.
Well, what you say Bobbie Ray?

215
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:09,960
Ray's a little jealous, just a little bit.

216
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:14,039
Margaret! The one that got away.

217
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:19,359
Beautiful signal on Margaret.
Lights on the deck.

218
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:31,192
Good... good stuff. Hold on.

219
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:42,871
Here's the Doctor.
It's time for my medicine.

220
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:47,200
- That's okay. That's okay, okay,
- Let me get a towel.

221
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:50,551
Don't worry about it.
I'd like the next one on the other leg, please.

222
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:53,108
Good one, Margaret!

223
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:56,789
Princess.

224
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:48,470
Paul? Thank you so much
for clearing the driveway.

225
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:50,437
That was real considerate.

226
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:52,949
Well, I don't know what you're talking
about, Mrs. Wherry.

227
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:55,276
You were out at the cabin this morning?

228
00:21:55,560 --> 00:21:58,154
Nice to see you getting
some use out of that thing.

229
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:02,598
Oh, now I see. No, no,
that was Raymond you saw out there.

230
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:03,675
He's alive?

231
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:06,075
Yeah, very much.

232
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:46,878
Oh, God. Come on!

233
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:52,917
How much easier do I have to make this?

234
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:17,117
Margaret, you scared
the wits out of me.

235
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:18,150
Look at the dog.

236
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,228
She's just a little puppy.

237
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:21,276
A little puppy she is.

238
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:22,196
Little hungry puppy.

239
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:23,435
A hungry, hungry puppy.

240
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:24,629
- Yes.
- Yes, she is.

241
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:25,949
- Come on over here.
- Well.

242
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:27,559
How late is Rudy's open?

243
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:02,878
I'm sorry about this part.

244
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:08,990
Thank you.

245
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:26,917
If it's any comfort, he likely wasrt
eaten while conscious.

246
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:28,991
So it was the fall?

247
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:31,153
Did he say where he was living
before he came?

248
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:31,957
Florida.

249
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:34,117
He didn't talk about it much.

250
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:35,913
He brought us this shell.

251
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:40,632
It's all we have left, really.
Hadrt seen him for five years.

252
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:42,074
We'd given him up for...

253
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:43,878
For dead, yes, sir.

254
00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:46,788
How did you...?

255
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:49,235
Anonymous phone tip
from some Jamaican... guy.

256
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:50,071
Jamaican?

257
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:52,071
He said he saw
what he thought was a body.

258
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:54,117
We tracked you through his ID.

259
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:55,593
Just like on TV.

260
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:57,948
I have to see him.

261
00:25:58,080 --> 00:26:00,913
Mr. Barnell, I have to warn you,
an animal attack isn't pretty.

262
00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:01,876
I know.

263
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,319
There's not much left.

264
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:06,195
Oh, God.

265
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:09,355
Is that your brother, sir?

266
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:11,038
Yeah. That's him.

267
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:13,518
Chewed his ears off.

268
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:16,550
What kind of animal
does something like that?

269
00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:18,911
Normally, I'd say a bear.

270
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:22,392
But with these tracks
and the feeding pattern, indicate wolf.

271
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:25,356
It's rare, but it can happen.

272
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:36,950
Your brother's personal effects.

273
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:39,790
Marcy, would you...

274
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:40,756
Yeah, no problem.

275
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:42,549
Come on, let's go this way.

276
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:43,232
Thank you.

277
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:47,073
Coroner found some smaller bite
marks on the ankle.

278
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:49,800
Pups. Must have been
the whole freaking pack.

279
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:51,393
Derek found this.

280
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:55,190
Not the smartest snack for a hiker.

281
00:26:56,560 --> 00:26:58,630
Messy animals, aren't they?

282
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:02,915
Messy. Messy, messy, messy, messy.

283
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:06,436
- Here ya go, say cheese!
- Cheese!

284
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:11,913
Shit!

285
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:14,834
You know, there are some places
on this planet

286
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:16,791
where people actually do this outside.

287
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:23,472
So how many insurance companies
are there in the United States?

288
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:26,279
- Like a billion.
- That's not the point, Tiffany.

289
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:28,356
That's not the point, Tiffany. I busted
my ass for Liberty Capital, all right?

290
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:29,595
I don't want to quit.

291
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:31,359
I want to be promoted.

292
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:35,516
I want to be promoted
out of this icebound backwater.

293
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:37,796
Okay.

294
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,468
And when that happens,
I guess I'lljust be another

295
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:42,631
notch on your briefcase.

296
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:47,118
I can't believe you just said that.

297
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:53,998
Well, you know that you're the most
most important thing in my life.

298
00:27:54,560 --> 00:27:58,872
Sorry, what was that?
You wanna take me right here?

299
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:02,197
Tiffany, what do you want...?

300
00:28:05,320 --> 00:28:06,355
You gonna get that?

301
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,150
Psych... I'm sorry, hello?

302
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:15,070
Who is it?

303
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:16,150
Yeah?

304
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:19,359
Look, is this a matter of life
and death? Because...

305
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:20,435
Tiff, give me the phone.

306
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:22,279
Yeah. Hello?

307
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:27,195
You're kidding.

308
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:28,516
Your mom?

309
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:32,675
A million dollar life policy just checked.

310
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:38,790
On a Saturday? What about the First
Annual Golf, Sex and Pizza Triathlon?

311
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:40,075
Look, Tiffany, if this is who I think it is

312
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:41,559
I may have found us
a ticket out of here, so...

313
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:42,994
We don't need a ticket.

314
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:46,311
Yeah, can I call you back? Okay.

315
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:49,915
We... I mean...

316
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:52,039
Don't be late, okay?

317
00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:54,559
You won't even know I'm gone.

318
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:04,949
That's him. Raymond Barnell.

319
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:09,120
So, what's your line on this?

320
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:12,472
Just what it looks like. Wolves got him.

321
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:15,071
Maybe a grizzly with insomnia,

322
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:16,912
but I couldn't find any tracks.

323
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:18,710
Well, would it surprise you to learn

324
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:21,917
that his brothertried to cash
in his policy not two weeks ago?

325
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:23,195
What are you trying to tell me

326
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:25,470
that Mr. Barnell chewed off
his brother's leg?

327
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:28,916
Well, doesn't it make you the least
bit suspicious that maybe...

328
00:29:29,080 --> 00:29:32,516
Mr. Watters, I don't know thing one
about insurance...

329
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:36,713
but I'm guessing it's your job
to find a way not to pay these poor people.

330
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:39,235
This is a nice, simple ending.

331
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:42,633
We like nice, simple endings.

332
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:51,436
Chief? Good news, bad news.

333
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:56,430
The good news, he's dead.
Bad news, he disappeared.

334
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:58,676
Proof, Jimbo. You got one week.

335
00:29:58,800 --> 00:29:59,676
It was our first time.

336
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:01,756
Nobody gets it perfect their first time, Dave.

337
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:03,199
Mr. Branch, this is not a standard case.

338
00:30:03,320 --> 00:30:04,958
You were there when the guy came in
and tried to cash in.

339
00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:06,638
I mean, come on. It stinks.

340
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:10,913
Watters, if the police say
that this guy was...

341
00:30:11,080 --> 00:30:13,116
Eaten by wolves, sir.

342
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:16,437
...eaten by wolves,
then we've got no case.

343
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:19,997
Did you happen to see
Mr. Barnell on the news last night?

344
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:21,832
The police told us what happened.

345
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:23,518
How are you folks holding up?

346
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:26,473
Well, my wife is too upset to be here.

347
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:28,358
Paul? Who's out there?

348
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:31,631
As I said, she's very upset.

349
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:33,119
Paul? The door's stuck.

350
00:30:33,320 --> 00:30:36,039
It's tough, though,
'cause you have to ask yourself...

351
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:38,037
Who fucked with the fucking door?

352
00:30:39,080 --> 00:30:41,150
You see how stressful his has been.

353
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:44,599
I have to go now because
we have a service to plan. Excuse me.

354
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:48,036
Hi.

355
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:51,348
Well, what we don't need is bad PR.

356
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:53,550
I don't want this thing Valdezing on us.

357
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:55,153
Mr. Branch I'm sure that head office

358
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:57,038
would take a rather dim view
of our approach to...

359
00:30:57,160 --> 00:31:00,596
Corporate's view will be what I tell them.

360
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:02,755
Okay.

361
00:31:03,080 --> 00:31:07,312
Yes, sir. Color us "called off" as of now.

362
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:10,833
Thanks, Cam. Thanks a lot.

363
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:14,471
Thanks for, all the back up.

364
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:17,359
You got a strange way of bucking
for a promotion, my friend.

365
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:20,391
Look, I'm gonna start on the Johnson file.

366
00:31:20,560 --> 00:31:22,471
You wanna do up
the paperwork on Barnell?

367
00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:26,755
Where you going?

368
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:27,630
Lunch.

369
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:28,710
At nine-thirty?

370
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:29,471
Yeah.

371
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:31,472
We got seven joints here.

372
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:34,871
We got a card place,
we got a Great Escape Travel, hair joint.

373
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:37,230
Which one you figure'd
wanna take our friend?

374
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:43,317
The police say they found Raymond's
wallet and that's how they tracked you down.

375
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:46,552
- Yes, that's right.
- Any idea what he was doing out there?

376
00:31:47,320 --> 00:31:50,312
He'd take walks. Hikes.

377
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:52,275
Hiking.

378
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:54,629
How sporty.

379
00:31:55,560 --> 00:31:58,597
- Can I get you a cup of coffee?
- No, thank you.

380
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:00,199
Was he a big hiker?

381
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:03,388
I'm sorry, I don't follow.

382
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:07,156
Well, would he hike more than once
a week or was this just a one time thing?

383
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:10,596
May I ask why you need to know all this?

384
00:32:11,080 --> 00:32:13,674
Just trying to tie up
some loose ends, Mr. Barnell.

385
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:17,953
You know, the police they say
my brother died in the attack.

386
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:21,348
Now, you do cover
that sort of thing, don't you?

387
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:24,916
Yes, sir, Mr. Barnell, and it shouldn't
take more than a few days.

388
00:32:25,080 --> 00:32:28,868
Now, can you uh, can you tell me
a little bit more about your brother?

389
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:29,955
The hiker?

390
00:32:44,560 --> 00:32:45,834
How is my princess?

391
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:51,995
What's up?

392
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:54,559
I took some Adavan.

393
00:32:57,480 --> 00:32:58,913
And called my psychic.

394
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:00,229
You know we can't afford that.

395
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:01,469
- We talked about that. Okay.
- Don't be mad.

396
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:04,791
- It's just this week has been so...
- I know. I know.

397
00:33:05,320 --> 00:33:07,151
Well, with Raymond
getting eaten by animals

398
00:33:07,320 --> 00:33:09,231
and someone trying to steal the fridge.

399
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:12,154
We got another letter from the HMO today.

400
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:17,479
Hey, come on now. Come on.

401
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:21,989
I'm sorry.

402
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:25,870
Fucking cocksuckers.

403
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:33,072
"As we previously stated
in the genetic history... "

404
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:35,196
I'm sick. I'm really, really sick, you know?

405
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:40,117
I know. "Tourette's Syndrome is not
easily diagnosed. No... "

406
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:41,229
Fuck, fuck!

407
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:44,756
"... onset before the age of 18
and no genetic history... "

408
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:47,235
"Please reference
our previous discussions... "

409
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:51,678
"... concerning you claims for... "
"... OCD, ODD, ADHP... "

410
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,956
It's what's going down
at the beginning of the century.

411
00:33:55,080 --> 00:33:56,672
Margaret!

412
00:33:56,800 --> 00:33:57,710
But still in matters vegetable, animal
and mineral...

413
00:33:57,880 --> 00:33:59,518
I am the very model of a modern
Major-General.

414
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:01,551
Margaret!

415
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:06,470
I know you don't like to talk about this.

416
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:09,959
But maybe it's not what
we think it is, you know?

417
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:12,437
Yeah, maybe it's not.

418
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:14,152
Maybe it's just stress.

419
00:34:17,720 --> 00:34:18,994
Rememberthat cruise?

420
00:34:21,880 --> 00:34:23,154
I saw you.

421
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:25,549
You were happy.

422
00:34:28,640 --> 00:34:32,269
You were this sweet, happy person.
Kind and giving.

423
00:34:35,080 --> 00:34:37,196
I'm sorry. I'm tired, you know.

424
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:41,552
They say you can't get it all of
a sudden, but I did. I really, really did.

425
00:34:41,720 --> 00:34:44,280
I know. I know.

426
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:47,029
Well, I'll kill myself.

427
00:34:47,160 --> 00:34:48,513
No, come on, that's nonsense!

428
00:34:48,640 --> 00:34:51,074
- Then they'll see.
- No, that's nonsense talk. Come here.

429
00:34:51,240 --> 00:34:52,798
No, come on now.

430
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:54,473
...marry someone normal.

431
00:34:54,640 --> 00:34:56,278
You're the most normal girl I know.

432
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:58,516
I'm not crazy, Paul.

433
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:02,313
- There's something wrong with me.
- I know, sweetie.

434
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:08,031
And we're gonna find the best specialists
for what you have we can.

435
00:35:09,160 --> 00:35:10,673
- Really?
- Yeah.

436
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:14,515
I know things are gonna turn around.

437
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:19,711
Call me cra... I got this feeling. I do.

438
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:22,879
But you have to leave everything
up to me, okay?

439
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:25,878
You leave everything up to me,

440
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:30,156
and you're gonna be okay. I promise.

441
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:45,515
Shit bag.

442
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:49,593
That's my girl.

443
00:35:56,080 --> 00:35:58,878
Yeah, hi. This is Ted Watters
from Liberty Capital.

444
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:02,913
I was wondering if I could get a complete
credit workup on a Raymond Barnell

445
00:36:03,080 --> 00:36:07,232
and a Paul Barnell, as well.

446
00:36:07,720 --> 00:36:09,312
Yes, I will hold.

447
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:11,393
You start the month ends yet?

448
00:36:11,560 --> 00:36:14,870
Oh, can you take care of that for me?
I'm kinda working on something here, Cam.

449
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,673
Oh, God. You're not still
on the Barnell thing, are you?

450
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:23,869
I went to go see him.

451
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:24,796
And? And?

452
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:28,236
So, trust me, something's not right.
I can smell it. Just help me buy a week.

453
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:29,515
We're gonna get in such trouble.

454
00:36:29,640 --> 00:36:32,598
Okay, from now on, you can come along
with me on everything.

455
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:36,349
No more Cam goes to the coffee room
and Ted disappears forthree hours?

456
00:36:37,080 --> 00:36:38,274
I'll try, yeah.

457
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:40,868
And you'll work on your interpersonal skills?

458
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:44,312
- Yes.
- Good.

459
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:47,631
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I'll go start covering your ass.

460
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:49,993
Oh, hi. Yeah, sorry.

461
00:36:51,640 --> 00:36:53,039
Are all these yours?

462
00:36:53,160 --> 00:36:54,559
Greatest sport on earth.

463
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:57,155
Moved to a compound bow two years ago.

464
00:36:57,320 --> 00:36:59,117
Arthritis. Less draw weight.

465
00:36:59,960 --> 00:37:00,949
Tea okay?

466
00:37:01,080 --> 00:37:03,594
Oh, yeah, yeah. Yeah, I'm fine. Thank you.

467
00:37:03,720 --> 00:37:08,236
I was just wondering, did you happen
to talk to Raymond when he got back?

468
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:11,676
Only saw him the once.
Never spoke to him.

469
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:13,388
Waved to him.

470
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:15,276
You waved?

471
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:17,231
He was clearing my driveway.

472
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:20,799
Raymond was a real hellcat
when he was younger.

473
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:24,430
But like they say,
time mellows even the hardest soul.

474
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:27,200
Was he much of an outdoo
rsman or ahiker or...?

475
00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:29,151
I thought it was Paul at first.

476
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:35,832
Have you talked to Paul's wife?

477
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:37,674
Now there's a story.

478
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:40,360
Not that I'm much of a one for gossip,
but I think that...

479
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:43,631
I'm sorry. Did you say you thought it
was Paul that did your driveway?

480
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:50,549
Okay. It turns out that Mr. Barnell
is mortgaged to the nuts.

481
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:53,234
His business is about one step away
from Chapter 11.

482
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:55,516
Plus, it's like his brother Raymond
never even existed.

483
00:37:55,640 --> 00:37:56,675
There's no credit history,

484
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:58,916
there's no nothing forthe last five years.

485
00:37:59,080 --> 00:38:01,036
Plus the only thing he did
after hisrecent reappearance...

486
00:38:01,160 --> 00:38:04,914
was get some new ID and a new credit
card, but he didn't charge anything.

487
00:38:05,080 --> 00:38:07,116
Less than nothing.

488
00:38:07,720 --> 00:38:09,551
- Okay, well, it's something.
- No, it's not.

489
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:12,951
- Yes, it is.
- No, it's not.

490
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,479
Claims, Watters.

491
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:17,639
This is personal.

492
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:20,109
I promise.

493
00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:26,471
Mr. Barnell, your ears must have been
burning. I was just...

494
00:38:27,320 --> 00:38:29,197
Oh, yeah, sure, yeah.

495
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:30,549
What time?

496
00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:35,589
Why is God, who is a loving God,
capable of such things?

497
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:40,759
When someone is taken from us at such
a young age, we often ourselves why.

498
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:41,710
Bullshit.

499
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:44,838
What possible purpose could this serve?

500
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:48,999
But I believe the Apostle Paul,
writing to the Ephesians,

501
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:53,950
said it best when he said
"All things are done according to God's will. "

502
00:38:54,080 --> 00:38:55,115
Nun banger.

503
00:38:59,560 --> 00:39:00,709
Doggies!

504
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:02,916
Raymond Barnell, Barnell's Travel.

505
00:39:03,080 --> 00:39:04,672
We should have seen it earlier.

506
00:39:05,480 --> 00:39:07,948
We should have checked the funeral
announcements right away.

507
00:39:08,080 --> 00:39:10,878
Mr. Barnell, there was really no hurry
on this. I mean...

508
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:12,274
we could've waited until later.

509
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:13,549
We just wrapped up.

510
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:15,993
This is my wife, Margaret.

511
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:19,516
Sweetheart, why don't you go
sit in the car and warm up, okay?

512
00:39:19,640 --> 00:39:21,073
Okey dokey, Smokey.

513
00:39:25,480 --> 00:39:27,914
She's been under a lot of stress lately.

514
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:30,992
I notice the media's here.

515
00:39:32,080 --> 00:39:34,594
They really don't give people
a moment's peace, do they?

516
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:38,029
I called them.

517
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:41,710
Really?

518
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:43,711
They wanted to talk to me about Raymond,

519
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:46,553
and I thought now would be
an appropriate time.

520
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:48,870
And you'lljust happen to mention
your heartless insurance company

521
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:50,274
that hasn't paid off your policy yet.

522
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:53,198
I had to borrow money to pay
forthis coffin, Mr. Ted.

523
00:39:53,320 --> 00:39:55,231
Well, you're breaking
my heart, Mr. Barnell.

524
00:39:55,400 --> 00:39:56,628
I doubt that.

525
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:04,155
They asked to see some personal
photos of Raymond.

526
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:08,789
Guess this is gonna be a really big story.

527
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:10,552
Maybe if we walked overthere together

528
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:13,393
and you told them how deeply moved
you were by this tragedy.

529
00:40:13,560 --> 00:40:15,516
Enjoy your press conference, Mr. Barnell.

530
00:40:39,720 --> 00:40:43,633
Raymond left us this shell.
It's all we have to remember him by, really.

531
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:13,959
Hello, little Bambi.

532
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:18,109
Where's your mommy?

533
00:41:20,080 --> 00:41:22,548
Getting it from some ten-point buck.

534
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:25,629
Yes, she is.

535
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:30,314
She is...

536
00:42:29,560 --> 00:42:31,471
Stay away from our fucking appliances!

537
00:42:31,640 --> 00:42:33,710
Okay, lady, let's just stay calm.

538
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:00,990
Sorry.

539
00:43:01,400 --> 00:43:03,391
Son of a bitch.

540
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:06,116
You are in so much trouble!

541
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:08,436
Lady, so help me...

542
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:15,075
Let's go again. Let's go... again.

543
00:43:17,480 --> 00:43:18,515
Okay, sir...

544
00:43:19,320 --> 00:43:20,275
In the house!

545
00:43:32,240 --> 00:43:34,390
So you're a souvenir wholesaler?

546
00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:36,391
Forthe cruise ship trade, mostly.

547
00:43:36,560 --> 00:43:40,712
Usual stuff... stuffed animals.
You got your huskies, your moose

548
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:42,677
your baby seals... your bears, your...

549
00:43:43,880 --> 00:43:45,074
Is that where they came in?

550
00:43:45,240 --> 00:43:47,834
Yeah, through that big hole in the roof.

551
00:43:49,080 --> 00:43:51,310
I got a list of all
the things that are missing.

552
00:43:59,080 --> 00:44:00,069
How much?

553
00:44:01,240 --> 00:44:03,117
We figure about two hundred grand.

554
00:44:03,240 --> 00:44:04,798
Plus fixing the roof.

555
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:07,190
Fax over an estimate and we'll have
you a check by Friday.

556
00:44:07,320 --> 00:44:10,995
Ted? Maybe we should take
a look at the irinventory list first.

557
00:44:11,160 --> 00:44:13,230
This is a simple case.
Bad guys stole stuff.

558
00:44:13,400 --> 00:44:15,038
Let's just clear it and get going, okay?

559
00:44:15,160 --> 00:44:19,438
I should tell you, we also had some
VCRs we were holding for another company.

560
00:44:19,560 --> 00:44:21,437
That could run another couple grand.

561
00:44:22,560 --> 00:44:25,996
Wanna wrap this up, Cam?
Gotta go primary sometime!

562
00:44:36,720 --> 00:44:39,712
You try to rape me,
I swearto Christ, I'll bite it off.

563
00:44:46,320 --> 00:44:47,548
Hey, what's going on?

564
00:44:47,880 --> 00:44:49,950
- Don't ask!
- What the hell happened to your face?

565
00:44:50,080 --> 00:44:51,991
Jesus, you look like you ran into...

566
00:44:53,320 --> 00:44:56,232
So what now, you gonna get me
smoking from both ends?

567
00:44:59,960 --> 00:45:02,076
I just came here to look around

568
00:45:02,240 --> 00:45:04,390
and she started hitting me
and yelling at me.

569
00:45:04,560 --> 00:45:05,231
Oh, please.

570
00:45:05,480 --> 00:45:06,959
Is this how you solve our problem?

571
00:45:07,080 --> 00:45:09,435
I didn't have any choice.
Just listen to me, okay?

572
00:45:09,560 --> 00:45:12,393
Yeah, listen. If the fat from your neck
hasn't stopped up your ears.

573
00:45:19,160 --> 00:45:21,993
- Where would we stash her? Your place?
- No, it's too small.

574
00:45:22,160 --> 00:45:24,469
Plus, we'd have to get her in
and out without anyone seeing.

575
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:26,995
And I've seen that sty
you call an apartment.

576
00:45:27,160 --> 00:45:29,674
You see, it's a bad idea.

577
00:45:35,400 --> 00:45:37,356
They got a whirlpool tub.

578
00:45:39,960 --> 00:45:41,234
With bubbles?

579
00:45:41,480 --> 00:45:43,311
Lt'd be like a little getaway.

580
00:45:56,800 --> 00:46:00,270
Hey Maggie Magster. You're awfully...

581
00:46:01,640 --> 00:46:02,834
What the hell happened?

582
00:46:04,960 --> 00:46:06,313
What the hell are you doing in our house?

583
00:46:06,480 --> 00:46:07,674
Mr. Barnell.

584
00:46:08,240 --> 00:46:10,800
I believe you have something that
belongs to us.

585
00:46:12,640 --> 00:46:14,153
I don't know what you're talking about.

586
00:46:14,320 --> 00:46:15,116
You don't?

587
00:46:15,720 --> 00:46:18,837
You hearthat, Gary?
He don't know what we're talking about.

588
00:46:21,240 --> 00:46:22,958
Guess he doesn't know nothing about a...

589
00:46:23,080 --> 00:46:26,038
dead body in the dumpster
at his place of employment.

590
00:46:29,720 --> 00:46:31,153
So how much did you get?

591
00:46:34,960 --> 00:46:38,236
We had a life insurance policy
on my brother

592
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:41,073
and we could get...

593
00:46:41,240 --> 00:46:43,276
one hundred thousand dollars.

594
00:46:46,160 --> 00:46:49,550
You know, it's always you quiet guys.

595
00:46:52,960 --> 00:46:56,111
All right, here's how it's gonna work.

596
00:46:56,880 --> 00:46:59,474
We stay here with your little tulip in there

597
00:46:59,800 --> 00:47:01,199
and you go get our guy.

598
00:47:02,960 --> 00:47:04,712
You stay here?

599
00:47:04,880 --> 00:47:08,270
Have the body and let's say

600
00:47:09,560 --> 00:47:12,711
fifty thousand clams for ourtrouble.

601
00:47:12,960 --> 00:47:16,999
You screw with us and we'll start mailing
your wife back to you.

602
00:47:22,880 --> 00:47:24,711
Starting with her feet.

603
00:47:44,560 --> 00:47:47,472
Paul! Are you moving in?

604
00:47:48,080 --> 00:47:49,479
Just for a bit.

605
00:47:49,640 --> 00:47:51,676
She'll come to her senses.

606
00:47:51,800 --> 00:47:53,233
They always do.

607
00:47:54,560 --> 00:47:56,039
Thanks, Mrs. Wherry.

608
00:47:58,240 --> 00:47:59,150
Good night.

609
00:48:15,800 --> 00:48:16,994
Oh, Raymond.

610
00:48:17,480 --> 00:48:20,358
Would it have killed you
to clean up before you left?

611
00:49:05,800 --> 00:49:07,119
State police! Open up!

612
00:49:07,640 --> 00:49:09,551
Police? Is there something wrong?

613
00:49:20,320 --> 00:49:22,880
Hello, brother. Missed ya.

614
00:49:27,240 --> 00:49:28,798
Page sixteen, Paul.

615
00:49:29,480 --> 00:49:32,040
You know what I love about USA Today,

616
00:49:32,160 --> 00:49:36,153
otherthan the bar graphs
and the colored pictures?

617
00:49:36,320 --> 00:49:39,676
They got news from every state
in the Union.

618
00:49:40,400 --> 00:49:43,790
I was eaten by wild fucking animals!

619
00:49:44,560 --> 00:49:48,997
But you know, despite that,
I'm feeling pretty goddamn chipper.

620
00:49:49,240 --> 00:49:51,549
Let me tell you
what's going on here, Raymond.

621
00:49:53,160 --> 00:49:55,958
So where's my money?

622
00:49:56,080 --> 00:49:59,959
Your money? There's no money yet.
They're still investigating.

623
00:50:00,320 --> 00:50:01,389
What'd you get?

624
00:50:02,160 --> 00:50:03,559
Fifty thousand.

625
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:05,433
I get half.

626
00:50:05,720 --> 00:50:06,596
Sure.

627
00:50:09,400 --> 00:50:11,311
You look good. You lost weight.

628
00:50:11,800 --> 00:50:13,916
I gave up carbs.

629
00:50:14,800 --> 00:50:18,270
I'm getting a health kick.

630
00:50:21,960 --> 00:50:23,757
What you doing out here, anyway?

631
00:50:25,080 --> 00:50:26,479
She not going along with it?

632
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:28,479
Who, Margaret?

633
00:50:29,560 --> 00:50:31,790
How's she holding up, anyway?

634
00:50:32,800 --> 00:50:34,358
We're having problems.

635
00:50:36,160 --> 00:50:37,275
Any kids?

636
00:50:38,560 --> 00:50:41,552
You still can't get one past the goalie, huh?

637
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:48,710
Well, it's best not to send
a boy to do a mars job.

638
00:50:50,720 --> 00:50:52,597
So how come you talk like you do?

639
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:55,468
I mean, cursing all the time.

640
00:50:55,800 --> 00:50:58,109
It's a disease.
It's called Tourette's Syndrome.

641
00:50:58,240 --> 00:51:01,357
I can't control what I say. Turnip.

642
00:51:02,320 --> 00:51:03,196
Really?

643
00:51:03,320 --> 00:51:04,355
Congratulations.

644
00:51:04,960 --> 00:51:07,474
You've just kidnapped
a handicapped person.

645
00:51:07,800 --> 00:51:12,112
I saw on TV where people
with that don't usually curse.

646
00:51:12,320 --> 00:51:13,639
They must have got it wrong.

647
00:51:13,800 --> 00:51:14,869
I don't think so.

648
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:17,912
It was a movie of the week
based on real events.

649
00:51:18,800 --> 00:51:21,837
And don't people
with Tourette's usually twitch and stuff?

650
00:51:25,960 --> 00:51:28,428
I get it. Sorry. You got a spice rack?

651
00:51:29,960 --> 00:51:33,509
Next to the stove.
What's that supposed to mean?

652
00:51:33,640 --> 00:51:35,119
Nothing. Cumin?

653
00:51:36,480 --> 00:51:38,471
There. There. There.

654
00:51:38,640 --> 00:51:42,633
There, there, there, there, there, there!

655
00:51:43,080 --> 00:51:46,356
And I'm not crazy.
It's a physical disease.

656
00:51:46,480 --> 00:51:48,311
Sometimes I can control it,
and sometimes... I can't.

657
00:51:48,480 --> 00:51:51,199
You can't. You know what I think?

658
00:51:51,720 --> 00:51:55,599
I think this syndrome is something you
read about somewhere and figured...

659
00:51:55,720 --> 00:51:57,551
"Hey, works for me. "

660
00:51:57,720 --> 00:51:59,039
Ass. Ass. Ass.

661
00:51:59,160 --> 00:52:02,516
You can completely abdicate
your societal responsibilities.

662
00:52:02,640 --> 00:52:05,712
Say whatever want whenever you want,
and slough it off on an illness.

663
00:52:05,880 --> 00:52:07,074
Ass-rimming ball sucker.

664
00:52:07,240 --> 00:52:09,037
Maybe I should catch this thing.

665
00:52:09,160 --> 00:52:10,798
"Gee, sorry, Your Honor,

666
00:52:10,960 --> 00:52:13,269
I have this disease that makes me
rob 7-Elevens.

667
00:52:13,400 --> 00:52:15,550
It's called I really need a Slurpee disease. "

668
00:52:15,720 --> 00:52:19,156
You've never robbed a 7-11 in your life
you shit-eating fuck-weasel.

669
00:52:19,320 --> 00:52:21,709
What kind of a man threatens a woman
with a gun, anyway?

670
00:52:21,880 --> 00:52:23,632
You are so faking it.

671
00:52:23,800 --> 00:52:25,028
You should know.

672
00:52:25,960 --> 00:52:27,552
Is this how you get your kicks,

673
00:52:27,720 --> 00:52:30,712
you overcompensating
pussy little fart sack?

674
00:52:30,880 --> 00:52:34,793
You better shut your mouth
or I'm gonna stick this gun right in it!

675
00:52:34,960 --> 00:52:36,757
You don't scare me. If something bad
was gonna happen,

676
00:52:36,880 --> 00:52:38,313
my psychic would have told me.

677
00:52:39,960 --> 00:52:41,757
You put that down now, you little bitch,

678
00:52:42,080 --> 00:52:45,436
or so help me I'll start yelling
so loud, you'll have to shoot me.

679
00:52:58,880 --> 00:53:00,154
A little help here?

680
00:53:02,880 --> 00:53:04,199
I got Twinkies.

681
00:53:13,880 --> 00:53:14,756
Honey?

682
00:53:16,800 --> 00:53:17,835
You okay?

683
00:53:18,400 --> 00:53:21,597
Wait, this is the important part.
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

684
00:53:22,640 --> 00:53:23,629
This stops now.

685
00:53:23,800 --> 00:53:24,471
I was watching that.

686
00:53:24,640 --> 00:53:27,200
This case is making me and you crazy.

687
00:53:27,320 --> 00:53:28,389
Especially you.

688
00:53:30,880 --> 00:53:33,030
I'm just trying to be supportive.

689
00:53:33,560 --> 00:53:37,519
Leading experts agree that's the number
one complaint men had about their mates.

690
00:53:37,800 --> 00:53:41,270
I don't have any complaints about my, you.

691
00:53:43,800 --> 00:53:45,119
Dead guy's got a record?

692
00:53:45,240 --> 00:53:47,993
Yeah, he beat some guy
up in a bar fight.

693
00:53:48,160 --> 00:53:50,037
He broke the guy's eye socket.

694
00:53:56,640 --> 00:53:58,039
- Honey?
- Yeah.

695
00:53:58,160 --> 00:53:59,991
- I think you should look at this again.
- Okay.

696
00:54:15,560 --> 00:54:18,757
You know, I've been thinking there, Paulie.

697
00:54:20,800 --> 00:54:24,349
After we get her back
from these guys who grabbed her

698
00:54:24,520 --> 00:54:27,751
do you think your wife's
gonna be able to keep her

699
00:54:27,880 --> 00:54:29,711
pretty little mouth shut?

700
00:54:29,880 --> 00:54:31,552
That'd be a first.

701
00:54:32,840 --> 00:54:34,910
'Cause, you know,
crazy people talk a lot and...

702
00:54:35,080 --> 00:54:36,354
- She's not...
... and I'm told that

703
00:54:36,520 --> 00:54:40,229
if you say something to yourtherapist,
they can use that in a courtroom.

704
00:54:40,400 --> 00:54:42,118
We can't afford a therapist, Raymond.

705
00:54:42,280 --> 00:54:45,795
Still, you just might want to think about it.

706
00:54:47,080 --> 00:54:48,229
Think about what?

707
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:50,672
All I'm saying is,

708
00:54:50,800 --> 00:54:54,270
sometimes a man has
to make problematic decisions.

709
00:54:54,440 --> 00:54:57,989
Cull the herd, so to speak.

710
00:55:05,040 --> 00:55:08,350
Come on, Paulie, I'm just
I'm just fuckir with you.

711
00:55:08,480 --> 00:55:09,913
Don't be such a stick.

712
00:55:10,080 --> 00:55:12,116
Is that jailhouse humor?

713
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:15,672
Still...

714
00:55:32,400 --> 00:55:33,150
Mr. Watters.

715
00:55:33,720 --> 00:55:36,951
On the phone you said something
about a resolution to our claim?

716
00:55:37,120 --> 00:55:39,031
Mr. Barnell, why are you staying out here?

717
00:55:39,840 --> 00:55:44,755
My wife and I we're having
a few problems.

718
00:55:44,920 --> 00:55:47,309
Well, that's kind of understandable,
seeing as how you killed that man

719
00:55:47,480 --> 00:55:49,516
and dumped his body out
in the middle of the woods.

720
00:55:49,680 --> 00:55:50,430
Raymond?

721
00:55:50,600 --> 00:55:51,635
No, no, no.

722
00:55:51,800 --> 00:55:52,755
Definitely not Raymond.

723
00:55:52,920 --> 00:55:55,992
I thought it was at first,
but that's what was throwing me.

724
00:55:56,160 --> 00:55:58,071
I don't think I appreciate yourtone, sir.

725
00:55:58,240 --> 00:56:03,189
My tone?
Mr. Barnell, you are going to jail.

726
00:56:03,360 --> 00:56:04,475
I will personally see to that.

727
00:56:04,640 --> 00:56:05,516
I think you should go now.

728
00:56:05,680 --> 00:56:08,274
You are a liar and a thief!

729
00:56:08,400 --> 00:56:09,116
Mr. Watters, I've had a very rough night.

730
00:56:09,280 --> 00:56:09,712
Murderer.

731
00:56:09,880 --> 00:56:10,232
No.

732
00:56:10,360 --> 00:56:11,793
You are a murderer.

733
00:56:19,200 --> 00:56:20,713
What happened to your eye?

734
00:56:21,960 --> 00:56:24,235
Let's say you just step away from him.

735
00:56:28,320 --> 00:56:29,753
You all right there, Paul?

736
00:56:30,240 --> 00:56:32,356
I'm all right, Mrs. Wherry. It's okay.

737
00:56:32,520 --> 00:56:34,670
I can drop him, if you want.

738
00:56:34,840 --> 00:56:36,990
No. I'm all right.

739
00:56:39,680 --> 00:56:42,513
I think you should go.
She can't hold the bow that long.

740
00:56:53,520 --> 00:56:56,512
I got some fishing line,
if you want me to stitch that.

741
00:57:00,480 --> 00:57:01,390
You okay?

742
00:57:02,360 --> 00:57:05,830
Yeah. I'm great.

743
00:57:10,280 --> 00:57:11,713
I haven't called the police yet,

744
00:57:12,240 --> 00:57:14,390
but I can tell you it was certainly tempting.

745
00:57:15,040 --> 00:57:19,750
In my life, I've had dealings
with diseases of the mind and...

746
00:57:20,640 --> 00:57:22,676
he is definitely disturbed.

747
00:57:23,560 --> 00:57:26,472
Watters, it's so good of you to join us.

748
00:57:26,600 --> 00:57:30,354
Mr. Barnell was just telling me
about the last meeting you had.

749
00:57:31,760 --> 00:57:33,113
I caught that, yeah.

750
00:57:33,240 --> 00:57:37,392
And, as you can see,
Mr. Barnell has some concerns.

751
00:57:39,560 --> 00:57:41,710
You don't think I did this.

752
00:57:45,280 --> 00:57:49,910
- I would never...
- His neighbor says otherwise.

753
00:57:53,320 --> 00:57:55,754
Mr. Branch, can I show you something?

754
00:57:55,920 --> 00:57:58,673
I think you would like to see it, too,
Mr. Barnell.

755
00:58:01,840 --> 00:58:04,673
Okay, see? Where's the birthmark?

756
00:58:05,400 --> 00:58:06,389
Your brother's police report listed,

757
00:58:06,560 --> 00:58:08,278
"large, purple birthmark, upper right thigh".

758
00:58:08,440 --> 00:58:10,112
But I don't see it here, not on this body.

759
00:58:10,280 --> 00:58:14,353
You can-you can see it here,
in the-in the picture. See?

760
00:58:15,040 --> 00:58:17,031
So where did it go?

761
00:58:17,200 --> 00:58:20,795
Did it just disappear? Did it all of
a sudden get better, Mr. Barnell?

762
00:58:28,880 --> 00:58:31,030
It did get better, Mr. Watters.

763
00:58:31,200 --> 00:58:32,315
It did?

764
00:58:32,480 --> 00:58:33,674
It got better!

765
00:58:34,440 --> 00:58:36,829
Well, how in the world did that happen?

766
00:58:37,560 --> 00:58:43,715
Well... Raymond, when he came back
from Florida,

767
00:58:43,880 --> 00:58:45,313
he'd had it fixed.

768
00:58:46,480 --> 00:58:50,553
Laser surgery. Yeah, how like
you remove a tattoo.

769
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:52,115
I understand.

770
00:58:52,280 --> 00:58:53,793
And it gone.

771
00:58:57,800 --> 00:58:59,711
He did... not! No! He didn't!

772
00:58:59,880 --> 00:59:00,551
What do you mean? Did not.

773
00:59:00,720 --> 00:59:03,632
How can you tell? There's no leg!

774
00:59:03,760 --> 00:59:08,993
You taped my brother's body
in a morgue. And this! What's this?

775
00:59:09,240 --> 00:59:11,310
You stole family pictures!

776
00:59:11,480 --> 00:59:15,553
You videotaped the naked chewed
corpse of my little brother!

777
00:59:15,680 --> 00:59:18,353
What the kind of sick company
are you running here, sir?

778
00:59:18,520 --> 00:59:21,592
This is crazy! This is crazy!

779
00:59:21,720 --> 00:59:25,110
All we have to do is dig up the body
I'm not talking to you!

780
00:59:25,240 --> 00:59:28,357
Dig up the body and check
for laser scars! Dental records!

781
00:59:29,360 --> 00:59:34,229
- All right. All right!
- All right. All right!

782
00:59:37,760 --> 00:59:43,756
Mr. Barnell, I'm so very sorry
that it's come to this.

783
00:59:43,920 --> 00:59:46,912
We will have a check brought to you first
thing in the morning.

784
00:59:52,200 --> 00:59:53,155
Thank you.

785
01:00:08,360 --> 01:00:10,749
Jesus. Thank God he's not suing us.

786
01:00:11,640 --> 01:00:15,076
Tomorrow, you will deliver a check
to Mr. Barnell

787
01:00:15,240 --> 01:00:17,754
with a complete apology.

788
01:00:19,680 --> 01:00:22,274
Mr. Branch, I know how this looks...

789
01:00:22,440 --> 01:00:25,671
It looks like you beat hell
out of a policy holder!

790
01:00:25,800 --> 01:00:27,313
Now, send Cam in here.

791
01:00:27,440 --> 01:00:30,034
While you've been out on
your little Easter egg hunt,

792
01:00:30,200 --> 01:00:34,034
your junior found us a way out
on that warehouse robbery.

793
01:00:34,520 --> 01:00:37,432
Head Office is going to bump him a level.

794
01:00:41,880 --> 01:00:42,835
I'll go get him.

795
01:00:44,840 --> 01:00:47,354
Head Office is very keen on him.

796
01:00:48,400 --> 01:00:51,631
They've asked me
to feel him out about a transfer.

797
01:00:54,680 --> 01:00:57,831
County Coroner.
It's a Disinterment Order.

798
01:00:58,360 --> 01:01:01,033
Hello. Yes, I was wondering
if you could tell me

799
01:01:01,200 --> 01:01:03,589
which department is in charge of...

800
01:01:05,200 --> 01:01:06,315
Sure, I'll hold.

801
01:01:07,160 --> 01:01:09,196
Hang on, Mag Pie. Hang on.

802
01:01:33,120 --> 01:01:36,669
Listen, you little prick!
We want what's coming to us!

803
01:01:42,880 --> 01:01:43,995
I know you are, but what am I?

804
01:01:44,160 --> 01:01:45,115
Gary!

805
01:01:46,400 --> 01:01:47,037
Gary!

806
01:01:47,200 --> 01:01:48,110
Yourturn to deal with it!

807
01:01:48,280 --> 01:01:49,793
If I come out of this bathroom,

808
01:01:49,960 --> 01:01:52,269
I swearto God I'll put
a fucking bullet in her head!

809
01:01:52,440 --> 01:01:54,271
I know you are, but what am I?

810
01:01:55,240 --> 01:01:58,471
Ray. Can I talk to you for a moment?

811
01:01:59,160 --> 01:02:00,434
Ladies.

812
01:02:00,600 --> 01:02:01,430
Ladies.

813
01:02:05,840 --> 01:02:06,750
Listen, who's...?

814
01:02:07,080 --> 01:02:07,830
The prostitutes?

815
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:09,752
I sure as hell hope so.

816
01:02:09,880 --> 01:02:13,634
'Cause Jehovah's Witness won't lick your lolly
no matter how much you pay them.

817
01:02:14,040 --> 01:02:15,189
How'd you get them here?

818
01:02:15,360 --> 01:02:18,352
I just put it on my plastic.

819
01:02:18,480 --> 01:02:22,393
It's got my name on it and everything.
"It's everywhere that we want to be. "

820
01:02:22,640 --> 01:02:25,154
You can't use this.

821
01:02:25,320 --> 01:02:28,232
No, no, no. Think. Okay? Ray?

822
01:02:29,040 --> 01:02:30,632
You're not using your head, Raymond.

823
01:02:30,800 --> 01:02:33,189
The fuck you say.

824
01:02:38,200 --> 01:02:40,509
What in blazes is that on the counter, Ray?

825
01:02:40,720 --> 01:02:43,314
That's "muh gun", Paul.

826
01:02:48,760 --> 01:02:49,431
Hello?

827
01:02:49,560 --> 01:02:52,233
Hello, Mr. Barnell. It's Jimbo.

828
01:02:52,360 --> 01:02:53,509
Sorry, I can't...

829
01:02:53,680 --> 01:02:55,272
Are you having a party?

830
01:02:55,560 --> 01:02:58,472
There's no party.
Put my wife on the phone.

831
01:02:58,640 --> 01:03:00,358
- Sir, that's not right.
- Now! Please.

832
01:03:00,520 --> 01:03:03,910
- Thirty, sorry, starting now!
- I have to talk to my wife.

833
01:03:04,320 --> 01:03:07,630
Well, he wants to talk to her.
Okay, hold on.

834
01:03:07,800 --> 01:03:08,471
Twenty-five!

835
01:03:08,640 --> 01:03:10,073
Paul, are you entertaining?

836
01:03:10,240 --> 01:03:12,913
Oh, Margaret, no!
Oh, God, Jesus, are you all right?

837
01:03:13,080 --> 01:03:15,036
Fifteen! Have you got the body?

838
01:03:15,200 --> 01:03:16,315
Paul, we need more chips!

839
01:03:16,480 --> 01:03:17,310
Have you got the body?

840
01:03:17,480 --> 01:03:19,391
Paul, the carrot little weasely one
wants to carrot screw me

841
01:03:19,560 --> 01:03:20,072
with his sick carrot little cock.

842
01:03:20,240 --> 01:03:22,754
And he's messing up my kitchen.
Cock, cock, cock, cock...

843
01:03:22,880 --> 01:03:24,313
You sick you don't hurt her!

844
01:03:24,480 --> 01:03:28,075
I didn't say anything like that.
I didn't. Ten seconds! Yes or no?

845
01:03:28,240 --> 01:03:29,434
Paul, where's the chips?

846
01:03:30,800 --> 01:03:34,634
Yes. You'll have it tomorrow.
Now put my wife back...

847
01:03:36,600 --> 01:03:37,191
Hello!

848
01:03:37,520 --> 01:03:39,636
I think I managed to avoid a trace.

849
01:03:40,640 --> 01:03:42,756
We're staying in his house.

850
01:03:45,040 --> 01:03:45,916
Right.

851
01:03:46,880 --> 01:03:48,916
Hello! Can I help you?

852
01:03:50,080 --> 01:03:51,035
Mr. Watters.

853
01:03:51,560 --> 01:03:54,597
Mr. Barnell, I...

854
01:03:54,920 --> 01:03:57,036
I have your check.

855
01:03:57,920 --> 01:03:58,670
Really?

856
01:03:59,160 --> 01:03:59,990
Yeah.

857
01:04:01,640 --> 01:04:05,155
Thank you very much.
I appreciate that. Please sit.

858
01:04:05,400 --> 01:04:06,230
Avis.

859
01:04:15,960 --> 01:04:17,029
Did you have an accident?

860
01:04:17,560 --> 01:04:19,915
Well, no, actually I was mugged.

861
01:04:20,400 --> 01:04:23,836
The police say it was just
a random act of violence,

862
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:26,275
but who knows, right?

863
01:04:30,840 --> 01:04:35,391
I have to get you to sign right here
where I marked

864
01:04:35,560 --> 01:04:39,951
an X. And...

865
01:04:41,480 --> 01:04:44,313
I'd like to apologize for...

866
01:04:44,480 --> 01:04:46,994
No. No, please. No need.

867
01:04:52,600 --> 01:04:54,272
Well, that's quite the shell.

868
01:04:55,400 --> 01:04:56,992
It's a gift from my brother, Raymond.

869
01:04:57,640 --> 01:05:01,713
He brought it back from Florida for me,
and now it's all I have to remember him by.

870
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:04,911
Well, that and a million dollars.

871
01:05:07,880 --> 01:05:10,110
Boy, things really worked out for you
this time, didn't they?

872
01:05:10,280 --> 01:05:12,510
- Lots of cash. Newly single guy...
- I'm not single.

873
01:05:12,680 --> 01:05:13,749
Well, what are you gonna do?

874
01:05:13,920 --> 01:05:15,831
You gonna go down to Club Med
and see how much a big bankroll can buy?

875
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:16,750
Maybe get some hookers?

876
01:05:16,920 --> 01:05:18,751
I love my wife, Mr. Watters.

877
01:05:21,320 --> 01:05:22,389
Very much.

878
01:05:26,360 --> 01:05:32,629
Can we level with each other
for a moment? How... how did...

879
01:05:32,800 --> 01:05:33,630
Avis!

880
01:05:36,720 --> 01:05:37,516
Avis!

881
01:05:40,760 --> 01:05:41,909
I got it.

882
01:05:42,320 --> 01:05:43,594
A second. Thank you.

883
01:05:52,120 --> 01:05:54,190
That's where you went!

884
01:06:02,400 --> 01:06:03,992
That's quite the display.

885
01:06:04,560 --> 01:06:07,313
They do some very nice
in-store promotions.

886
01:06:08,520 --> 01:06:10,272
Here it is, Mr. Barnell.

887
01:06:10,520 --> 01:06:12,909
I thought someone
might have walked out with it.

888
01:06:13,080 --> 01:06:14,593
It's not the best neighborhood.

889
01:06:21,520 --> 01:06:24,193
Sign right by the X.

890
01:06:42,560 --> 01:06:45,632
Avis, will you call Municipal
Light and Power

891
01:06:45,800 --> 01:06:48,155
and tell them I'll be dropping by in a bit?

892
01:06:52,360 --> 01:06:53,190
Thank you.

893
01:07:17,240 --> 01:07:19,071
There's nothing to be embarrassed about.

894
01:07:19,240 --> 01:07:23,074
A lot of people find talking
to a psychic very therapeutic.

895
01:07:23,520 --> 01:07:25,511
So what's on your mind, Carlos?

896
01:07:26,240 --> 01:07:29,676
I have a situation. My wife...

897
01:07:31,440 --> 01:07:35,035
Do you think it's okay to do
something kinda bad to someone

898
01:07:35,440 --> 01:07:40,594
even though they may do something
to someone else that's really bad?

899
01:07:41,560 --> 01:07:45,712
Well, you probably shouldn't break
the law, if you can help it.

900
01:07:45,840 --> 01:07:49,150
Are you really sure
they're gonna do this otherthing?

901
01:07:50,120 --> 01:07:53,351
He said some things.
He said he was joking,

902
01:07:53,480 --> 01:07:56,631
but I think he might do them.

903
01:07:56,800 --> 01:07:59,473
Okay, well, don't think, know.

904
01:07:59,720 --> 01:08:01,551
How close are you
to this other someone else,

905
01:08:01,720 --> 01:08:03,233
the one you're trying to protect?

906
01:08:08,560 --> 01:08:10,357
Have you ever felt like

907
01:08:11,640 --> 01:08:13,870
like your own life didn't even matter

908
01:08:15,040 --> 01:08:16,792
as long as

909
01:08:17,960 --> 01:08:19,473
Listen to me Carlos.

910
01:08:19,600 --> 01:08:23,309
Your wife is an incredibly lucky woman.

911
01:08:23,480 --> 01:08:25,072
I know relationships are tough,

912
01:08:25,240 --> 01:08:28,915
but you you just do what you gotta do
to keep it together, okay?

913
01:08:29,320 --> 01:08:32,835
Remember, love is sacrifice.

914
01:08:39,680 --> 01:08:41,033
I guess you're right.

915
01:08:42,120 --> 01:08:44,315
Okay, so you get tough, all right?

916
01:08:44,720 --> 01:08:47,917
And remember, this call is
for entertainment purposes only.

917
01:08:48,320 --> 01:08:50,675
But call me back and let me know
how it goes, okay?

918
01:08:51,080 --> 01:08:52,832
- Okay.
- All right.

919
01:09:02,120 --> 01:09:02,757
Okay.

920
01:10:08,880 --> 01:10:12,714
So, Miami, huh?
Can you believe that?

921
01:10:12,840 --> 01:10:15,274
One little case and, boom,
you're the flavor of the month.

922
01:10:15,880 --> 01:10:18,792
Congratulations. Why are you here?

923
01:10:18,920 --> 01:10:21,753
To say thanks.
If you hadrt given me a shot on that...

924
01:10:21,920 --> 01:10:24,593
Oh, no, no, no.
Forget about it. I'm trying to.

925
01:10:25,160 --> 01:10:28,675
So, we were all kinda wondering,
what did happen to your face?

926
01:10:29,080 --> 01:10:30,149
Can'trouble.

927
01:10:32,920 --> 01:10:33,750
Should you be driving?

928
01:10:33,920 --> 01:10:34,875
Absolutely not.

929
01:11:06,240 --> 01:11:07,036
Jodie!

930
01:11:18,960 --> 01:11:20,552
We set forthe switch tomorrow?

931
01:11:20,680 --> 01:11:21,556
Yeah.

932
01:11:21,720 --> 01:11:25,395
There's a turnout up at Summit
Hill where the snowmobilers park.

933
01:11:25,560 --> 01:11:26,913
Fine.

934
01:11:36,400 --> 01:11:38,072
You guys like it?

935
01:11:41,120 --> 01:11:42,712
Tastes like a rectal polyp.

936
01:11:47,520 --> 01:11:49,795
Now, how would she know?

937
01:11:53,360 --> 01:11:54,793
How would she know?

938
01:11:57,440 --> 01:11:58,793
How would she know?

939
01:11:59,360 --> 01:12:03,069
I coulda had her, you know?
We both know that.

940
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:04,830
Right?

941
01:12:09,960 --> 01:12:13,794
Oh, yeah, yeah, I just figured she was...

942
01:12:14,200 --> 01:12:18,512
I don't know. You know?
'Cause I... You know?

943
01:12:18,640 --> 01:12:19,993
No, I don't know.

944
01:12:20,400 --> 01:12:22,550
- Okay.
- You ready for a refill?

945
01:12:22,720 --> 01:12:25,029
Does Mrs. Kennedy have a black dress?

946
01:12:27,120 --> 01:12:30,271
- Alrighty.
- Comir up.

947
01:12:34,720 --> 01:12:37,473
So, rendezvous
at the glaciertomorrow, huh?

948
01:12:37,600 --> 01:12:39,830
First thing in the morning.

949
01:12:42,240 --> 01:12:45,755
Yeah, well, we'll go get her
and do the thing, and...

950
01:12:48,880 --> 01:12:51,952
You rememberthat time in school

951
01:12:52,120 --> 01:12:56,352
when I jumped out and scared you
and you fucking peed all over yourself?

952
01:12:56,480 --> 01:12:57,993
That was a hoot, yeah.

953
01:12:59,080 --> 01:13:00,433
Hey, bottoms up.

954
01:13:01,240 --> 01:13:07,634
Okay. Puddles! You remember
how everybody called you "Puddles"?

955
01:13:07,880 --> 01:13:09,757
Everybody called you "Puddles".

956
01:13:09,920 --> 01:13:10,875
They did.

957
01:13:11,640 --> 01:13:12,390
Puddles!

958
01:13:12,560 --> 01:13:13,993
Yeah, that was funny.

959
01:13:15,240 --> 01:13:16,832
Hey, come on now.

960
01:13:17,120 --> 01:13:19,554
There you go, there you go.

961
01:13:23,560 --> 01:13:25,073
I love you, bro.

962
01:13:25,240 --> 01:13:26,389
You too, pal.

963
01:13:28,280 --> 01:13:29,030
Okay.

964
01:15:21,400 --> 01:15:22,913
It's my tub! Open up!

965
01:15:23,080 --> 01:15:23,910
Finders keepers.

966
01:15:24,080 --> 01:15:25,672
No, I drew the water! Get out!

967
01:15:25,840 --> 01:15:27,751
- Finders keepers.
- Get out of here.

968
01:15:28,440 --> 01:15:30,351
You know this thing has twelve
different settings?

969
01:15:30,520 --> 01:15:34,672
No, Gary I don't. Every time I try to get
in it, somebody else is already there.

970
01:15:34,840 --> 01:15:36,353
Stop that!

971
01:15:36,920 --> 01:15:39,115
Hey, let me ask you something.
Does this look normal?

972
01:15:39,280 --> 01:15:40,554
Oh, Christ!

973
01:15:40,680 --> 01:15:43,274
I read that if it changes color,
you should have it looked at.

974
01:15:43,400 --> 01:15:45,072
Yeah... but not by me!

975
01:15:57,600 --> 01:15:58,271
Hello?

976
01:15:58,400 --> 01:16:00,470
Oh, thank fucking Christ! Is Tiffany there?

977
01:16:00,720 --> 01:16:03,792
No, well, she's gonna be
back in a couple of minutes.

978
01:16:03,960 --> 01:16:05,552
Do you want to call back later?

979
01:16:05,720 --> 01:16:06,914
Well, you should know, fuckwit.

980
01:16:07,080 --> 01:16:09,389
Do you know there's a man with a gun
in my bathroom right now?

981
01:16:09,560 --> 01:16:10,754
Goddamnit, Ted.

982
01:16:10,920 --> 01:16:13,832
Oh, wait, yeah, she's right here.
One second.

983
01:16:14,240 --> 01:16:15,514
Mrs. Barnell?

984
01:16:17,440 --> 01:16:19,271
I'm here, Margaret.
How're you feeling today?

985
01:16:19,440 --> 01:16:20,190
Give me the headset.

986
01:16:20,320 --> 01:16:21,833
What is wrong with you?

987
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:23,831
Christ! Where do you want to start?

988
01:16:23,960 --> 01:16:26,030
Mrs. Barnell could you speak up a bit?

989
01:16:26,200 --> 01:16:27,235
What's she saying?

990
01:16:27,400 --> 01:16:30,631
Something about the Gay Mafia taking
herto a park to kill her?

991
01:16:31,440 --> 01:16:34,989
Margaret, now are you sure
that these are real people in your house?

992
01:16:36,240 --> 01:16:37,309
Shit on toast.

993
01:16:38,440 --> 01:16:40,431
Jesus! Fucking dog.

994
01:16:40,600 --> 01:16:42,192
Watch out forJodie.

995
01:16:43,600 --> 01:16:45,830
How do you like the bubbles now?

996
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:47,672
You want to squeak your duck again?

997
01:16:49,240 --> 01:16:49,990
Jesus!

998
01:16:54,640 --> 01:16:56,596
- That really hurts, you know?
- Good!

999
01:17:03,360 --> 01:17:04,713
Why are the flowers talking?

1000
01:17:09,080 --> 01:17:09,990
Are you sure this is it?

1001
01:17:10,160 --> 01:17:12,674
She specifically mentioned
the cocksucking turnout off the highway

1002
01:17:12,800 --> 01:17:14,836
where the snowmobilers like to hang out.

1003
01:17:16,280 --> 01:17:17,395
I'll call you later, okay?

1004
01:17:18,280 --> 01:17:19,793
I won't be here.

1005
01:17:19,960 --> 01:17:20,631
Excuse me?

1006
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:24,912
I know relationships aren't gonna be
all sunshine and roses,

1007
01:17:25,080 --> 01:17:27,150
but I'm not really having
that much fun anymore,

1008
01:17:27,320 --> 01:17:28,992
and I don't think you are, either.

1009
01:17:29,760 --> 01:17:31,034
What are you talking about?

1010
01:17:31,400 --> 01:17:33,550
I just I think you need to be
like this right now,

1011
01:17:33,720 --> 01:17:36,234
and I'm not in a good space to deal with it.

1012
01:17:38,440 --> 01:17:39,316
So, what?

1013
01:17:42,040 --> 01:17:45,191
I just, I don't think we should be
like this together.

1014
01:18:20,880 --> 01:18:22,154
Psychic Pals.

1015
01:18:24,040 --> 01:18:26,031
How are you today, Mr. Williams?

1016
01:18:28,520 --> 01:18:31,034
I think she'd be fine with you re-marrying.

1017
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:35,831
But hang on, let me concentrate...

1018
01:18:44,640 --> 01:18:46,756
I've been... I've been cutting
you out of my life

1019
01:18:47,640 --> 01:18:51,952
and, as a result, our normal communication
channels have been blocked.

1020
01:18:52,120 --> 01:18:54,031
And I think that you coming with me

1021
01:18:54,520 --> 01:18:57,512
would furtherthe development
of our relationship

1022
01:18:57,800 --> 01:19:01,110
and allow us both to realize the...

1023
01:19:01,280 --> 01:19:04,590
the potential of our interpersonalism.

1024
01:19:04,800 --> 01:19:06,870
If you're gonna be sarcastic...

1025
01:19:07,040 --> 01:19:08,632
I'm not being anything.

1026
01:19:13,880 --> 01:19:16,394
Okay. Why do you want me to come?

1027
01:19:19,600 --> 01:19:20,794
Because if you don't,

1028
01:19:21,720 --> 01:19:24,473
then... then I'll have to stay.

1029
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:28,833
And then, then I'll be mad about that.

1030
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:33,831
And then, and then I know that

1031
01:19:34,080 --> 01:19:36,230
we'll eventually break up over it.

1032
01:19:41,560 --> 01:19:43,630
And as bad as my life is right now, Tiffany,

1033
01:19:43,800 --> 01:19:45,597
that would make it a million times worse.

1034
01:19:54,400 --> 01:19:55,674
Mr. Williams?

1035
01:19:56,360 --> 01:19:58,271
You know, she's totally cool with it.

1036
01:19:58,400 --> 01:20:01,153
Listen, listen, you're gonna
have to call back.

1037
01:20:01,720 --> 01:20:03,676
I gotta go help my boyfriend.

1038
01:21:22,040 --> 01:21:25,191
See this? This has all the symptoms of
that Tourette's thing...

1039
01:21:25,360 --> 01:21:26,793
and you don't have half of them.

1040
01:21:26,920 --> 01:21:27,511
And?

1041
01:21:27,680 --> 01:21:29,796
And... and you're faking it.

1042
01:21:29,960 --> 01:21:31,632
Magazines don't prove anything.

1043
01:21:31,760 --> 01:21:34,035
Could we please get ther
e in some peace and quiet?

1044
01:21:34,200 --> 01:21:35,872
Magazines prove everything.

1045
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:37,672
Don't make me pull the car over.

1046
01:21:46,400 --> 01:21:48,152
Okay, so it's called The Listening Game.

1047
01:21:48,320 --> 01:21:51,551
You talk, I listen,
and I can't interrupt. Then we switch.

1048
01:21:51,960 --> 01:21:53,234
I can talk about anything?

1049
01:21:54,520 --> 01:21:55,475
Yes.

1050
01:21:56,160 --> 01:21:57,912
Let's just drop it, okay?

1051
01:21:58,080 --> 01:22:01,629
I'm just saying, she acts like this
'cause you always take her side!

1052
01:22:07,160 --> 01:22:09,230
That little prick!

1053
01:22:40,480 --> 01:22:42,152
I assume you have our friend?

1054
01:22:42,280 --> 01:22:44,589
Of course. Can you let her go now?

1055
01:22:45,000 --> 01:22:46,592
Let's see our guy first.

1056
01:22:51,680 --> 01:22:52,635
How do we know it's him?

1057
01:22:52,800 --> 01:22:54,631
Come on!
Where would I get another one?

1058
01:22:55,920 --> 01:22:57,194
You got the money, Mack?

1059
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:04,753
So, this is kinda like a really weird
"Law and Order" episode.

1060
01:23:04,880 --> 01:23:06,791
And if Paul Barnell already
killed his brother...

1061
01:23:06,960 --> 01:23:08,473
Yeah, maybe his wife is next.

1062
01:23:11,600 --> 01:23:13,033
Okay, so my turn?

1063
01:23:13,160 --> 01:23:13,910
Yeah.

1064
01:23:14,040 --> 01:23:15,234
Now, a healthy relationship...

1065
01:23:15,400 --> 01:23:16,435
Here we are.

1066
01:23:23,480 --> 01:23:24,310
Can I let her out?

1067
01:23:24,480 --> 01:23:26,675
No! Step away from the car!

1068
01:23:39,440 --> 01:23:40,509
Why did you gag her?

1069
01:23:42,120 --> 01:23:43,155
You know.

1070
01:24:01,760 --> 01:24:05,435
- It's all over. Did they hurt you?
- No, no, no...

1071
01:24:05,600 --> 01:24:07,192
You don't look so good.
Have you been eating?

1072
01:24:07,320 --> 01:24:09,151
- Yeah, I've been. You? Did they feed you?
- Did you drink too much coffee?

1073
01:24:09,320 --> 01:24:10,753
No, you know, when I get busy. You know.

1074
01:24:10,920 --> 01:24:11,750
Did you fall?

1075
01:24:11,880 --> 01:24:14,394
- Yeah, but... Chipped a tooth.
- We'll fix that when we get home.

1076
01:24:15,320 --> 01:24:16,673
Boy, you look good.

1077
01:24:18,120 --> 01:24:19,269
You smell nice.

1078
01:24:19,440 --> 01:24:20,714
- Yeah.
- Musty.

1079
01:24:21,160 --> 01:24:22,229
How's Jodie?

1080
01:24:22,400 --> 01:24:23,310
She's dead.

1081
01:24:24,280 --> 01:24:25,156
Kidding.

1082
01:24:28,080 --> 01:24:29,069
Pretty good.

1083
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:31,274
So, do you have a plan here?

1084
01:24:31,400 --> 01:24:32,913
You know, I guess I'm gonna

1085
01:24:33,400 --> 01:24:35,550
I'm gonna go talk to him.

1086
01:24:36,640 --> 01:24:39,632
- Yeah. You don't mind staying here, do
- Sure.

1087
01:24:39,800 --> 01:24:41,756
Wait. When do we call the cops?

1088
01:24:43,800 --> 01:24:49,591
You know, I mean, if he is doing
something then, I'lljust,

1089
01:24:50,560 --> 01:24:52,278
I'll wave, okay?

1090
01:24:56,640 --> 01:24:58,358
That's a very good plan.

1091
01:25:05,160 --> 01:25:06,309
Tourists.

1092
01:25:10,080 --> 01:25:12,833
- Wait isn't... isn't that?
- What?

1093
01:25:14,120 --> 01:25:17,351
Excuse me! Excuse me!

1094
01:25:23,720 --> 01:25:25,472
Arert you Raymond Barnell?

1095
01:25:25,800 --> 01:25:26,835
Go away.

1096
01:25:27,160 --> 01:25:28,752
Hey, you know, I don't really know
what's going on here,

1097
01:25:28,880 --> 01:25:30,757
but I was just wondering if maybe
you could come with me to my office

1098
01:25:30,920 --> 01:25:32,592
just for a few minutes. I mean...

1099
01:25:34,040 --> 01:25:36,031
Hey, man, you know,
I don't wanna screw with your life,

1100
01:25:36,160 --> 01:25:37,832
but you can't just walk away
with a million dollars

1101
01:25:37,960 --> 01:25:40,076
and expect people to be like,
"Hey, yeah, thanks a lot pal. "

1102
01:25:45,480 --> 01:25:46,754
How much?

1103
01:25:50,440 --> 01:25:55,594
Your brother,
and I use this term very carefully

1104
01:25:56,040 --> 01:25:59,953
has stolen a million doll
ars from my insurance company...

1105
01:26:02,800 --> 01:26:06,349
For years I've been thinking new meds...

1106
01:26:10,440 --> 01:26:11,793
You know, maybe we should...

1107
01:26:16,320 --> 01:26:22,350
Honey, I need you to walk overto that
big hill behind me, okay? Okay?

1108
01:26:22,680 --> 01:26:26,832
Why don't you put this on now, okay?
I want you to get warm, all right?

1109
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:28,591
You look so good.

1110
01:26:28,760 --> 01:26:32,150
No matter what you hear
what you hear,

1111
01:26:32,320 --> 01:26:34,231
you just keep walking, all right?

1112
01:26:34,400 --> 01:26:37,676
If I'm late or something...

1113
01:26:37,840 --> 01:26:38,795
You're never late.

1114
01:26:39,000 --> 01:26:41,116
...look inside the coat.

1115
01:26:58,160 --> 01:26:59,036
Jimbo?

1116
01:27:09,000 --> 01:27:10,991
Million dollars, Paul?

1117
01:27:12,440 --> 01:27:16,069
Did you really think
you could take me? Again?

1118
01:27:16,360 --> 01:27:17,952
What million dollars?

1119
01:27:18,160 --> 01:27:19,434
Fuck.

1120
01:28:18,920 --> 01:28:21,673
What the fuck!
She didn't have anything to do with this!

1121
01:28:21,800 --> 01:28:22,869
And you do.

1122
01:28:26,680 --> 01:28:28,796
Put it down, nancy.

1123
01:28:28,960 --> 01:28:30,313
You first, chief.

1124
01:28:31,520 --> 01:28:34,751
You win, tough guy.

1125
01:28:39,600 --> 01:28:40,350
Gary.

1126
01:28:40,880 --> 01:28:41,995
Sorry.

1127
01:28:44,800 --> 01:28:46,233
It was an accident!

1128
01:28:46,640 --> 01:28:49,154
- What the fuck, man?
- It wasrt me!

1129
01:28:49,280 --> 01:28:49,951
Gary!

1130
01:28:50,280 --> 01:28:51,713
Please don't shoot us!

1131
01:28:52,400 --> 01:28:56,757
Stop! What the fuck, Gary? Jesus Christ!

1132
01:28:56,920 --> 01:28:57,750
No!

1133
01:29:07,640 --> 01:29:09,676
Oh! Oh, God!

1134
01:29:23,280 --> 01:29:25,350
Oh, God. Oh, Jesus.

1135
01:29:25,520 --> 01:29:28,432
Oh, fucking hell. I can't breathe.

1136
01:29:40,280 --> 01:29:41,269
Can you stand?

1137
01:29:41,440 --> 01:29:42,509
Is the Pope a...

1138
01:29:42,680 --> 01:29:43,351
Easy.

1139
01:29:51,240 --> 01:29:52,116
Thank you.

1140
01:30:32,480 --> 01:30:34,994
You're gonna kill me, Gary.
Gonna kill me.

1141
01:31:12,800 --> 01:31:14,552
Look at me, you little...

1142
01:31:24,160 --> 01:31:25,149
Puddles.

1143
01:32:06,400 --> 01:32:07,515
Where do you think you're going?

1144
01:32:07,680 --> 01:32:08,749
Ted, leave him alone!

1145
01:32:08,920 --> 01:32:10,592
No, no, no, no!

1146
01:32:12,720 --> 01:32:15,314
No, I've been beaten!

1147
01:32:16,160 --> 01:32:18,037
I've been humiliated!

1148
01:32:19,520 --> 01:32:21,351
He kicked me in the balls!

1149
01:32:22,000 --> 01:32:23,956
He kicked me in the balls!

1150
01:32:25,240 --> 01:32:26,992
And I want an answer now!

1151
01:32:27,520 --> 01:32:28,270
Okay.

1152
01:32:31,800 --> 01:32:34,394
Well, go ahead.
I can still kind of hear out of this one.

1153
01:32:40,520 --> 01:32:42,272
I love my wife, Mr. Watters.

1154
01:32:44,040 --> 01:32:45,951
And when you love someone

1155
01:32:47,120 --> 01:32:49,395
I mean, really love someone...

1156
01:32:49,560 --> 01:32:50,549
That's it!

1157
01:32:51,680 --> 01:32:53,955
Fuck! If I wanted a Hallmark card

1158
01:32:54,120 --> 01:32:57,032
orthe lyrics to a Foreigner rock ballad,

1159
01:32:57,160 --> 01:33:00,835
I would go to the mall, Mr. Barnell!
The Listening Game.

1160
01:33:18,920 --> 01:33:21,593
Mr. Barnell... you can go first.

1161
01:33:40,720 --> 01:33:42,073
Habeas corpus.

1162
01:33:43,040 --> 01:33:46,635
I wanted to help Margaret, you know?

1163
01:33:47,520 --> 01:33:48,873
I'm broke

1164
01:33:49,040 --> 01:33:52,430
and that's why I came in originally
with that insurance policy thinking,

1165
01:33:52,560 --> 01:33:54,994
"I can do this. You'll pay off. "

1166
01:33:55,160 --> 01:33:59,153
'Cause, you know,
I hadrt seen Raymond since...

1167
01:34:51,560 --> 01:34:52,356
Where do you want to go?

1168
01:34:52,520 --> 01:34:53,396
Someplace close.

1169
01:34:53,560 --> 01:34:55,596
My three o'clock was moved up.

1170
01:34:56,080 --> 01:34:58,116
So you all right about everything?

1171
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:01,069
Yeah.

1172
01:35:01,280 --> 01:35:02,633
Good. Good.

1173
01:35:02,760 --> 01:35:04,751
I like it when you're okay.

1174
01:35:09,360 --> 01:35:11,351
Don't you just love this weather?

1175
01:35:13,560 --> 01:35:14,549
Learning to.
