No one call me for three days.

163
00:12:27,667 --> 00:12:31,271
Oh, my head's throbbing.

164
00:12:31,917 --> 00:12:34,440
It's fucking throbbing, Dickie.

165
00:12:34,833 --> 00:12:37,791
Like a disco in my head.
Like a fucking Manila disco

166
00:12:37,792 --> 00:12:40,975
full of transvestites
and suckling pigs.

167
00:12:41,333 --> 00:12:43,582
I've got a seizure in my brain.

168
00:12:43,583 --> 00:12:47,563
A diabolical seizure of
fucking and sucking coke.

169
00:12:47,750 --> 00:12:49,443
I did too much.

170
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:52,649
I tried to make up for
too much lost time.

171
00:12:53,167 --> 00:12:55,110
I fucked myself to death.

172
00:12:56,042 --> 00:12:57,644
My head's gonna explode.

00:12:57,708 --> 00:13:00,687
Bits of my brain's
gonna go everywhere.

174
00:13:00,792 --> 00:13:02,457
I'm gonna ruin your blazer.

175
00:13:02,458 --> 00:13:04,207
You're gonna be all right, Dom.

176
00:13:04,208 --> 00:13:05,832
Fuck you. You don't know my head.

177
00:13:05,833 --> 00:13:08,457
You don't know the
revolution going on...

179
00:13:09,958 --> 00:13:13,107
Fucking insurgents inside my brain.

180
00:13:13,167 --> 00:13:16,771
Cossacks sodomising my cranium.

00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,398
- Here.
- What's that? A hand grenade?

182
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:22,809
- Hair of the dog.
- That dog shat on my soul.

183
00:13:23,167 --> 00:13:25,082
Drink it. It's mother's
little helper.

184
00:13:25,083 --> 00:13:27,902
My mother left me when I was
three. Fuck my mother.

Fuck, I'm dying.

I'm dying. I'm gonna
die on this train.

If dying on this train will
shut you up, I'm all for it.

You can't make up for 12
years in three days, Dom.

191
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:56,060
Well, I tried.

192
00:14:01,583 --> 00:14:04,357
I fucking tried.

I've been sent by Monsieur
Fontaine. Follow me.

Oi, lardo!

200
00:14:29,750 --> 00:14:32,820
If you're sent by Mr Fontaine,
then carry my fucking bag.

go get my fucking money.

203
00:14:50,542 --> 00:14:53,270
It's interesting, the
French countryside.

00:14:53,708 --> 00:14:57,017
Looks like a barmaid's snatch
after a Cup Final weekend.

have a well-stocked bar.

Dom, don't think what
you're thinking.

That's Mr Fontaine's property.

00:16:14,375 --> 00:16:16,457
Property is a relative
term for a thief.

- Still.
- I'm just looking.

- She's rather fit.
- Not her, not Paolina.

- Bugger off, Dickie.

Call me Ivan. Are you crazy?

Ivan Anatolivich Fontanov,

I never called you Ivan

Well, you will now.

Do you hunt, Dom?

No, I don't, Ivan.

232
00:17:13,583 --> 00:17:15,624
I only use a gun to
hold up a place,

Rabbits are pets. I don't eat pets.

Yeah, 'course.

00:19:10,542 --> 00:19:12,110

Yes, Dom.

269
00:19:14,292 --> 00:19:16,736
Why do you think I'm wearing
this black glove all the time?

270
00:19:17,417 --> 00:19:19,477
I thought it was a fashion
statement or something.

271
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,317
Fashion statement?

272
00:19:22,458 --> 00:19:24,957
I've been in fucking prison
12 years. I missed a few things.

273
00:19:24,958 --> 00:19:27,060
I thought it was the latest
fashion. I don't know!

274
00:19:27,167 --> 00:19:30,942
You always were a bit of a clothes fag.
You lost your fucking hand?

275
00:19:31,542 --> 00:19:34,521
It was shot off three
years ago during a job.

276
00:19:34,958 --> 00:19:36,374
How do I not know that?

277
00:19:36,375 --> 00:19:39,354
They found his fingers strewn
all over the high street.

Fucking hell, Dickie. I'm sorry.

I'm good, Dom. It's all good.

Yeah, Dickie's a good soldier.

281
00:19:47,833 --> 00:19:49,935
Mmm, tough guy.

282

00:19:53,917 --> 00:19:55,564
So are you, Dom.

284
00:19:55,917 --> 00:19:58,019
The most stand-up man
I have ever met.

285
00:20:00,208 --> 00:20:01,810
- Dom is that.
- Yeah.

286
00:20:02,125 --> 00:20:04,899
Well, a rat is a rat
and a teat is a tit.

287
00:20:05,292 --> 00:20:08,362
FONTAINE:
Still, others would have broken.

288
00:20:08,917 --> 00:20:12,082
Those are others,
not Dom Hemingway.

289
00:20:12,083 --> 00:20:14,811
- FONTAINE: No, not you.
- Not me.

290
00:20:24,750 --> 00:20:28,559
You've done all right for yourself
the last 12 years, Mr Fontaine.

FONTAINE: Ivan, please.

292
00:20:30,458 --> 00:20:33,437
Ivan. You've done all
right for yourself.

293
00:20:34,250 --> 00:20:37,433
The art, the house.

294
00:20:37,917 --> 00:20:41,957
Or estate. This is an estate, right?
That's what they call it. It's very nice.

295
00:20:41,958 --> 00:20:44,561
It's a villa, Dom, a holiday home.

296
00:20:45,167 --> 00:20:47,770
But thank you, thank you.
I appreciate it.

297
00:20:50,167 --> 00:20:52,645
Is Ivan short for Ivana?

298
00:20:56,125 --> 00:20:59,149
No, just Ivan.

299
00:21:00,708 --> 00:21:02,526
Could be Ivana, though, right?

300
00:21:03,958 --> 00:21:07,642
It's Ivan, Ivan
Anatolivich Fontanov.

301
00:21:09,167 --> 00:21:13,272
Ivan, sorry. Ivan. Sorry.

302
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:15,147
It's OK.

303
00:21:16,083 --> 00:21:17,935
I could have ratted.

304
00:21:18,625 --> 00:21:20,318
I could have mentioned your name.

305
00:21:20,333 --> 00:21:24,374
I could have said Ivana Anatoli
Fontaine was the leader of the group.

306
00:21:24,375 --> 00:21:26,666
Maybe you are tired
from your trip, Dom?

307
00:21:26,667 --> 00:21:29,749
I kept my mouth shut and
I sat in that tiny cell

308
00:21:29,750 --> 00:21:33,229
while my wife died of cancer in the
arms of some other fucking bloke.

309
00:21:33,375 --> 00:21:35,318
I've heard about
that and I'm sorry.

310
00:21:35,958 --> 00:21:37,541
- Sorry?
- I'm sorry.

311
00:21:37,542 --> 00:21:38,957
- Try 12 years.
- I'm sorry, Dom...

312
00:21:38,958 --> 00:21:41,332
12 fucking years. Missed
my Evelyn growing up.

313
00:21:41,333 --> 00:21:43,435
I said I'm sorry.

314
00:21:43,542 --> 00:21:46,249
- Words are easy.
- And it's all I have.

315
00:21:46,250 --> 00:21:49,103
- You have something else.
- You are due and you will be paid.

316
00:21:49,333 --> 00:21:51,041
- Plus interest.
- Plus interest.

317
00:21:51,042 --> 00:21:52,815
Plus a present.

318
00:21:53,542 --> 00:21:55,736
- Present?
- For being so quiet.

00:21:56,083 --> 00:21:59,124
Those girls were a present.
Did you like them, Dom, huh'?

320
00:21:59,125 --> 00:22:00,874
The coke and the girls,
that was a present.

321
00:22:00,875 --> 00:22:05,526
Oh, you really think two birds and a
bit of blow are a worthy present?

322
00:22:06,042 --> 00:22:08,207
- After what I done for you?
- I was not suggesting...

323
00:22:08,208 --> 00:22:10,791
Cos that don't even come close
to a present, not even close.

324
00:22:10,792 --> 00:22:13,791
It's not even a stocking stuffer,
barely an opening act.

325
00:22:13,792 --> 00:22:16,975
Barely a fucking appetiser,
barely an <i>amuse-bouche.</i>

326
00:22:17,083 --> 00:22:20,999
It's nothing. It's nothing but a bit
of confetti in my ticker-tape parade,

327
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,874
and I want the full fucking parade.

328
00:22:23,875 --> 00:22:26,166
My ticker-tape parade, Ivana.

329
00:22:26,167 --> 00:22:28,999
I want the fucking band.
I want the fucking float.

330
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,666
I want the parade, the float,
the band and what you owe me.

331
00:22:31,667 --> 00:22:35,476
(YELLING) What you owe me
is what I fucking want!

332
00:22:37,083 --> 00:22:40,107
I said, you'll get what is yours.

333
00:22:40,292 --> 00:22:42,440
Plus a fucking present!

334
00:22:43,042 --> 00:22:44,874
- A real present.
- OK, Dom...

335
00:22:44,875 --> 00:22:47,194
Let's say, your girlfriend.

336
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,740
The one with the bicycle.
What's her name?

337
00:22:51,875 --> 00:22:54,124
- Paolina? I want her.
- (CHUCKLING)

338
00:22:54,125 --> 00:22:56,124
Don't be crazy, Dom.

339
00:22:56,125 --> 00:22:59,229
BOTH: (LAUGHING)

340
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,582
I'm not crazy.

341
00:23:01,583 --> 00:23:04,166
I want her, naked,
like she likes it,

342
00:23:04,167 --> 00:23:05,707
with a little red
bow on her clitoris

343
00:23:05,708 --> 00:23:08,832
- for me to untie with my teeth.
- Enough. The joke is over.

344
00:23:08,833 --> 00:23:10,999
- I think you should sober up, OK?
- Joke's on you, Ivana.

345
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:14,525
- Go rest. We'll see you at dinner.
- Ivana Anal-toli.

346
00:23:19,542 --> 00:23:22,166
I have been nothing but polite.

347
00:23:22,167 --> 00:23:25,291
Polite? Polite! Aren't
you the bee's knees?

348
00:23:25,292 --> 00:23:26,484
Cunt.

349
00:23:26,958 --> 00:23:28,401
Fucker.

350
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:30,817
Cunt.

351
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,353
You don't want me to get rough.

352
00:23:41,417 --> 00:23:42,541
Trust me, don't go there.

353
00:23:42,542 --> 00:23:44,394
Don't presuppose to
know what I want.

354
00:23:44,583 --> 00:23:46,749
You don't threaten me,
not with that girl's name.

355
00:23:46,750 --> 00:23:48,791
Not with that little
girl's name, Ivana.

356
00:23:48,792 --> 00:23:51,999
Ivana. Ivana? Ivana?
You don't scare me.

357
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,523
You don't fucking
scare me, Anal-toli.

358
00:23:54,583 --> 00:23:56,811
I've seen death. I've seen evil.

359
00:23:56,958 --> 00:23:58,874
I've seen fire. I've seen rain.

360
00:23:58,875 --> 00:24:00,957
I've seen lonely days
I thought would never end.

361
00:24:00,958 --> 00:24:02,582
You don't fucking scare me.

362
00:24:02,583 --> 00:24:05,874
I eye-fuck you. I throat-fuck you!

363
00:24:05,875 --> 00:24:07,582
- Dom!
- Shut it, Dickie!

364
00:24:07,583 --> 00:24:11,438
You one-armed fuck. You freak.
You one-armed fucking fuck freak!

365
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:15,480
No one's talking to you! No
one's ever talking to you!

366
00:24:36,708 --> 00:24:38,355
I'm fucking bored.

367
00:24:39,375 --> 00:24:40,476
(BURPS)

368
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:42,568
I'm fucking drunk.

369
00:24:44,875 --> 00:24:47,694
I'm fucking drunk and
I'm fucking bored.

370
00:24:48,917 --> 00:24:51,611
I said what I wanted to say.
I said it and you heard it.

371
00:24:52,333 --> 00:24:53,855
Now I'm gonna take a nap.

372
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,398
I'll see you wanks at dinner.

373
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:05,228
And no fucking rabbit.

374
00:25:15,458 --> 00:25:17,060
(GUNSHOT)

375
00:25:25,125 --> 00:25:26,374

00:25:26,375 --> 00:25:27,897
Dom, you up?

377
00:25:31,042 --> 00:25:32,143
It's 6:30, it's dinner.

378
00:25:35,125 --> 00:25:36,727
Dom, mate!

379
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:44,022
Dom?

380
00:25:53,625 --> 00:25:55,853
Jesus Christ.

381
00:25:59,875 --> 00:26:02,398
Dom! Dom!

382
00:26:02,750 --> 00:26:05,041
- Dom, are you fucking mad?
- I screwed it up, Dickie.

383
00:26:05,042 --> 00:26:06,291
I screwed everything up.

384
00:26:06,292 --> 00:26:09,111
Really? Cos I thought you
were just mentally retarded.

385
00:26:09,167 --> 00:26:11,124
Like those boys with the
bowl cuts on the telethons.

386
00:26:11,125 --> 00:26:13,541
- Dickie, I'm a mess. Look at me.
- I'm trying not to.

387
00:26:13,542 --> 00:26:17,416
I'm pathetic, I don't belong here.
I'm a monster. I'm a dinosaur.

388
00:26:17,417 --> 00:26:20,374
- Don't forget nudist, Dom. Don't forget that!
- I ought to be thrown away.

389
00:26:20,375 --> 00:26:23,374
Sent to a leper colony, forgotten
about, left to rot with the maggots.

390
00:26:23,375 --> 00:26:25,582
Jesus, Dom, you've got to
get control of yourself.

391
00:26:25,583 --> 00:26:27,481
You've got to beg
forgiveness of him.

392
00:26:27,708 --> 00:26:30,982
- You've got to put on trousers.
- I've been locked up for so long, Dickie.

393
00:26:31,250 --> 00:26:33,374
I see the light, the air.

394
00:26:33,375 --> 00:26:36,041
It's been so long since
I breathed clean air.

395
00:26:36,042 --> 00:26:37,374
I look at the clouds, I go nuts.

396
00:26:37,375 --> 00:26:40,604
You mix in the whisky, you mix
in the pussy, I go crazy.

397
00:26:40,708 --> 00:26:42,916
I'm a crazy man.
I'm a fucking nutter!

398
00:26:42,917 --> 00:26:45,332
- I mean, I'm afraid to see my own daughter.
- Really?

399
00:26:45,333 --> 00:26:48,357
But not too afraid to insult one of
the most dangerous men in Europe.

400
00:26:48,375 --> 00:26:51,604
Unfortunately, you had
the brass for that one.

401
00:26:57,250 --> 00:27:00,624
He's gonna kill me. I insulted
him in his own villa.

402
00:27:00,625 --> 00:27:03,194
- He'll forgive you.
- He's gonna fucking kill me, Dickie.

403
00:27:03,292 --> 00:27:06,316
He's gonna make Blinis out of
me balls and no one will care.

404
00:27:06,542 --> 00:27:08,457
- Fontaine's not gonna kill you.
- He could.

405
00:27:08,458 --> 00:27:10,541
No one would give a toss,
not even me own daughter.

406
00:27:10,542 --> 00:27:12,610
I would give a toss. She would too.

407
00:27:12,625 --> 00:27:16,275
12 years, Dickie, 12 years for
that money and I just blew it.

408
00:27:17,375 --> 00:27:18,852
You apologise to him.

409
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,569
You be a gentleman and
he'll be a gentleman.

410
00:27:21,958 --> 00:27:23,275
It'll be all right.

411
00:27:23,917 --> 00:27:26,861
Yeah? You promise?

412
00:27:27,083 --> 00:27:30,374
- Yes. But you don't insult his girl.
- (GRUNTS)

413
00:27:30,375 --> 00:27:33,166
You don't call him fucking Ivana,
you don't call him Anal-toli

414
00:27:33,167 --> 00:27:34,940
and you don't let him
see your pecker!

415
00:27:35,417 --> 00:27:37,291
You thank your goddamn lucky stars

416
00:27:37,292 --> 00:27:39,166
that he's a kind and gracious man.
Do you understand?

417
00:27:39,167 --> 00:27:40,291
- Yeah...
- Do you understand?

418
00:27:40,292 --> 00:27:42,770
- Yeah.
- Cos I ain't burying your body out here.

419
00:27:43,208 --> 00:27:46,187
I'm too fucking old and I
didn't bring the right shoes.

420
00:28:11,250 --> 00:28:12,772
Sorry I'm late.

421
00:28:14,542 --> 00:28:16,565
And sorry I was such a cunt.

422
00:28:22,208 --> 00:28:25,357
You must be Ivan's lady friend.

423
00:28:30,583 --> 00:28:33,562
You're a vision. You're an angel.

424
00:28:36,458 --> 00:28:38,981
Again, Ivan, Mr Fontaine,

425
00:28:39,417 --> 00:28:40,609
sorry.

426
00:28:40,667 --> 00:28:44,897
Me and, er, drink don't
always dance well together.

427
00:28:44,917 --> 00:28:47,145
I acted up. I acted outrageous.

428
00:28:47,667 --> 00:28:48,791
Sorry.

429
00:28:48,792 --> 00:28:52,476
Sorry I'm late for your dinner
and sorry about before.

430
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:54,352
When you were a cunt?

431
00:28:55,625 --> 00:28:58,524
(FORCED LAUGHTER)
Yeah, when I was a cunt.

432
00:29:06,500 --> 00:29:10,605
Dom, it is water under the bridge.

433
00:29:11,250 --> 00:29:12,522
You are forgiven.

434
00:29:14,292 --> 00:29:16,861
- Thank you.
- Now, sit, sit.

435
00:29:18,875 --> 00:29:22,058
Dinner is ready. The
rabbit is getting cold.

437
00:29:31,167 --> 00:29:32,860
Fantastic.

00:29:33,375 --> 00:29:35,022
I'm starving.

439
00:29:45,500 --> 00:29:49,150
FONTAINE: Everyone sit.
Get comfortable, please.

440
00:29:49,792 --> 00:29:52,270
Because you so enjoyed
the rabbit, Dom,

441
00:29:53,625 --> 00:29:55,477
I have a real treat for you.

FONTAINE: When I was 14,

455
00:31:03,583 --> 00:31:05,936
my very best friend in the world

456
00:31:06,167 --> 00:31:09,624
was riding his bicycle and
he accidentally crashed

457
00:31:09,625 --> 00:31:11,898
into this girl I liked.

458
00:31:13,917 --> 00:31:16,361
Her name was Tatiana.

459
00:31:16,667 --> 00:31:18,519
We went to school together,

460
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,194
though we hadn't ever talked.

461
00:31:21,667 --> 00:31:23,610
But I liked her from afar.

462
00:31:24,292 --> 00:31:29,353
Anyway, my best friend
accidentally crashed into her.

463
00:31:29,625 --> 00:31:31,693
She got banged up,

464
00:31:31,917 --> 00:31:35,726
got a black eye, crying,
the whole thing.

465
00:31:36,417 --> 00:31:41,068
I went over to my friend, took
the bike from him, lifted it up

466
00:31:41,417 --> 00:31:43,565
and smashed it over his head.

467
00:31:45,375 --> 00:31:51,437
Then I stomped on his hand with my
boot until every bone was broken.

468
00:31:51,583 --> 00:31:53,560
Then I took a rock

469
00:31:54,458 --> 00:31:57,641
and smashed it so
hard into his face,

470
00:31:57,750 --> 00:32:00,319
he not only lost most of his teeth

471
00:32:01,083 --> 00:32:03,481
but most of his jaw as well.

00:57:21,542 --> 00:57:22,734
I said I was sorry.

796
00:57:22,833 --> 00:57:26,062
I know you're sorry, but that
don't bring Bernard back to life.

797
00:57:26,958 --> 00:57:30,541
See, that's what I'm talking about.
Who calls their cat Bernard?

798
00:57:30,542 --> 00:57:33,065
'Course I killed your fucking cat.

799
00:57:41,625 --> 00:57:42,977
Come on.

800
00:57:43,958 --> 00:57:45,810
Damn it. Come on!

801
00:57:51,125 --> 00:57:53,523
You know I'm good at what I do.

802
00:57:53,958 --> 00:57:56,041
Your father wanted
me to work for him.

803
00:57:56,042 --> 00:57:59,225
But you never said yes, Dom.
You never said yes.

804
00:57:59,250 --> 00:58:01,624
I worked for Mr Fontaine.
I couldn't say yes.

805
00:58:01,625 --> 00:58:03,082
You could have, but you didn't.

806
00:58:03,083 --> 00:58:05,249
- I didn't cos I couldn't.
- You couldn't cos you wouldn't.

807
00:58:05,250 --> 00:58:07,191
I wouldn't cos I couldn't.
That's why I didn't.

808
00:58:07,250 --> 00:58:10,024
Fuck you! Couldn't,
wouldn't, shouldn't.

809
00:58:10,042 --> 00:58:11,735
(PANTING)

810
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:14,068
I got the magic fingers.

811
00:58:14,917 --> 00:58:16,749
You know that, I always did.

812
00:58:16,750 --> 00:58:18,582
You must remember that.

813
00:58:18,583 --> 00:58:20,249
Magic fingers, Lestor.

814
00:58:20,250 --> 00:58:22,832
You could use that. Your
business could use that.

815
00:58:22,833 --> 00:58:24,332
I run clubs, Dom.

816
00:58:24,333 --> 00:58:25,810
(LAUGHS)

817
00:58:26,833 --> 00:58:29,124
Bullshit, Lestor. You
know what you do.

818
00:58:29,125 --> 00:58:32,024
It's no secret. It's
your family business.

819
00:58:32,667 --> 00:58:34,624
See, there's a part of me

820
00:58:34,625 --> 00:58:37,124
that wants to put you in the
trunk of my sister's Prius,

821
00:58:37,125 --> 00:58:40,916
drive you up to Canvey Island and bury
you up to your thick fucking neck,

822
00:58:40,917 --> 00:58:43,440
cover your fat fucking
face in hamburger patties

823
00:58:43,458 --> 00:58:46,707
and let the creatures of the night
eat you to death while I watch.

824
00:58:46,708 --> 00:58:49,416
That's what I want,
you eaten to death

825
00:58:49,417 --> 00:58:52,416
bite by fucking bite,
peck by fucking peck

826
00:58:52,417 --> 00:58:54,986
and fang by motherfucking fang.

827
00:58:58,042 --> 00:59:02,067
See, I heard Belly retired and
his replacement's disappointing.

828
00:59:03,042 --> 00:59:05,457
So you come to the son of the
man you was at war with?

829
00:59:05,458 --> 00:59:06,541
He was competition.

830
00:59:06,542 --> 00:59:10,082
You come to the little boy
whose pussy cat you murdered?

831
00:59:10,083 --> 00:59:11,560
You need me, Lestor.

832
00:59:12,250 --> 00:59:15,354
You're an old man, Dom.
You should retire, too.

833
00:59:21,333 --> 00:59:22,810
I meant to.

834
00:59:23,042 --> 00:59:25,110
Yeah, I bet you did.

835
00:59:25,458 --> 00:59:27,777
(PANTING)

836
01:00:02,167 --> 01:00:03,610
It's not like the old days, Dom.

837
01:00:04,125 --> 01:00:06,273
They've got electronics now.

838
01:00:09,208 --> 01:00:10,651
A safe's a safe.

839
01:00:10,875 --> 01:00:12,977
Until you can't open it.

840
01:00:13,792 --> 01:00:16,270
Come by my club tonight at 11:00.

841
01:00:16,417 --> 01:00:17,814
Sugarfix.

842
01:00:17,875 --> 01:00:19,977
I have a new electronic safe there.

843
01:00:20,042 --> 01:00:23,249
If you can open it in 10 minutes,
you can come and work for me,

844
01:00:23,250 --> 01:00:25,068
bygones be bygones.

845
01:00:25,417 --> 01:00:27,457
I'll have plenty of
solid business for you.

846
01:00:27,458 --> 01:00:30,107
However, if you can't open it,

847
01:00:30,333 --> 01:00:33,277
I'm gonna chop off your tiny
dick and use it as a doorjamb.

848
01:00:35,708 --> 01:00:38,527
It's your call, Dom.
Show up or not.

849
01:00:39,333 --> 01:00:41,310
Open the safe or not.

850
01:00:41,667 --> 01:00:43,986
Piss standing up again or not.

851
01:00:44,167 --> 01:00:47,350
Those are your options.
Those are your choices.

852
01:00:47,833 --> 01:00:49,150
(GRUNTS)

853
01:00:49,250 --> 01:00:51,193
And that was for Bernard.

854
01:00:53,542 --> 01:00:56,249
- I thought that's what the last one was for.
- Nah, nah, nah.

855
01:00:56,250 --> 01:00:58,352
That was for my daddy.
This one is for Bernard.

856
01:00:58,583 --> 01:01:00,416
He was a good fucking cat

857
01:01:00,417 --> 01:01:02,957
and didn't deserve your ugly face
to be the last thing he saw.

858
01:01:21,333 --> 01:01:22,980
Thanks, Jeanie.

859
01:01:25,542 --> 01:01:27,916
Are you sure you should be
drinking like this, Dom?

860
01:01:27,917 --> 01:01:29,269
I'm good, Mum.

861
01:01:30,208 --> 01:01:31,707
I'm serious.

862
01:01:31,708 --> 01:01:34,666
You've got to open a safe later and
you haven't opened one in 12 years.

863
01:01:34,667 --> 01:01:37,737
I'm steady as a trapeze
artist's cunt.

864
01:01:38,583 --> 01:01:40,651
- Let me see your hand.
- What?

865
01:01:40,708 --> 01:01:44,017
Your hand. I want to see
if you're really steady.

866
01:01:44,208 --> 01:01:47,291
Look at your own hand, Dickie,
if you haven't lost it again.

867
01:01:47,292 --> 01:01:48,393
(SNIGGERS)

868
01:01:49,542 --> 01:01:53,067
Seriously, put out your hand,
Dom. Let me see it.

869
01:01:55,708 --> 01:01:56,809
Fucker.

870
01:01:57,917 --> 01:01:59,749
I could do surgery with this hand,

871
01:01:59,750 --> 01:02:02,249
operate on your caper-sized brain,

872
01:02:02,250 --> 01:02:04,978
finger a nun from five feet away.

873
01:02:05,208 --> 01:02:07,207
That safe don't scare me.

874
01:02:07,208 --> 01:02:10,642
Lestor McGreevy don't scare me.
Nothing scares me.

875
01:02:11,042 --> 01:02:13,941
Well, you're scaring me,
that much is true.

876
01:02:14,625 --> 01:02:16,193
I'm good.

877
01:02:17,333 --> 01:02:20,482
You're penniless, homeless. You're
fast on your way to being pissed.

878
01:02:21,208 --> 01:02:23,041
Your wank's on the line

879
01:02:23,042 --> 01:02:25,736
and you haven't opened
a safe in 12 years,

880
01:02:25,750 --> 01:02:28,148
and not an electronic
one, not ever.

881
01:02:28,208 --> 01:02:30,749
Aren't you the Easter
Bunny, hopping around,

882
01:02:30,750 --> 01:02:32,898
spreading good cheer
wherever you go?

883
01:02:33,708 --> 01:02:35,651
I'm just stating what I'm stating.

884
01:02:35,792 --> 01:02:39,457
- Stop stating what you're stating.
- I'm not gonna stop stating it.

885
01:02:39,458 --> 01:02:41,435
I'll state what I want to state
in whatever state I want to.

886
01:02:41,458 --> 01:02:43,231
State it again, I'll
knock your teeth out.

887
01:02:43,250 --> 01:02:44,957
Knock my teeth out,
I'll cut your ear off.

888
01:02:44,958 --> 01:02:47,541
Cut my ear off, I'll carve
your eye out with my big toe.

889
01:02:47,542 --> 01:02:48,624
- Fuck you.
- Fuck you.

890
01:02:48,625 --> 01:02:49,726
Fuck you.

891
01:02:50,958 --> 01:02:53,527
You think I ain't gonna
be able to do this?

892
01:02:53,958 --> 01:02:55,957
Me, Dom Hemingway?
Think I can't do this?

893
01:02:55,958 --> 01:02:59,582
There hasn't been a safe I
ain't been able to open, ever.

894
01:02:59,583 --> 01:03:02,857
When I was four months old, I could
open a safe from my fucking pram.

895
01:03:03,208 --> 01:03:05,151
I'm just saying.

896
01:03:05,833 --> 01:03:07,606
Don't say nothing.

897
01:03:11,917 --> 01:03:15,066
I'm gonna do this, Dickie.
I'm gonna do this.

898
01:03:17,542 --> 01:03:19,485
I got no other choice.

899
01:03:26,958 --> 01:03:29,186
(♪ DUBSTEP)

900
01:03:50,042 --> 01:03:53,041
State of the art. Had it
installed four months ago.

901
01:03:53,042 --> 01:03:55,691
- Made in Japan.
- I'm big in Japan.

902
01:03:56,833 --> 01:04:00,041
You have 10 minutes. Do you
want me to start the timing now?

903
01:04:00,042 --> 01:04:03,942
Or do you want to say a little
prayer for your friend Tiny first?

904
01:04:03,958 --> 01:04:06,607
I just want another pint.
Is that OK?

905
01:04:07,125 --> 01:04:09,478
Another drink before we start.

906
01:04:10,250 --> 01:04:12,694
Have all the beer you want, Dom.

907
01:05:08,833 --> 01:05:10,856
Right, let's get started.

908
01:05:11,917 --> 01:05:13,832
LESTOR: Clock says 11:35.

909
01:05:13,833 --> 01:05:16,561
It means you have until 11:45.

910
01:05:16,750 --> 01:05:19,478
Easy-peasy lemon squeezy.

911
01:05:26,667 --> 01:05:28,144
What the fuck is that?

912
01:05:28,208 --> 01:05:29,730
Equipment.

913
01:05:33,333 --> 01:05:34,901
Bloody hell!

914
01:05:35,417 --> 01:05:38,145
Fuck you and fuck your cat.

915
01:05:38,208 --> 01:05:42,438
I said, open my safe,
not destroy my office.

916
01:05:42,458 --> 01:05:45,562
Fuck your office, fuck you,

917
01:05:45,625 --> 01:05:48,444
fuck your father and fuck your cat.

918
01:05:48,458 --> 01:05:52,142
In nine minutes your balls
are becoming trinkets.

919
01:05:52,167 --> 01:05:56,568
Fuck your trinkets, fuck
your cat, fuck your father,

920
01:05:56,625 --> 01:05:59,353
fuck your office and fuck you!

921
01:06:10,917 --> 01:06:12,485
(PANTING)

922
01:06:14,750 --> 01:06:17,082
Not sure what you can do
in the time you have left,

923
01:06:17,083 --> 01:06:18,526
except maybe have a heart attack.

924
01:06:18,667 --> 01:06:20,485
I got to do a piss.

925
01:06:20,708 --> 01:06:23,527
- What?
- Piss. I got to.

926
01:06:23,542 --> 01:06:25,707
I'm not stopping the clock.

927
01:06:25,708 --> 01:06:28,778
'Course you aren't.
You're pond scum, Lestor.

928
01:06:28,833 --> 01:06:30,832
Garbage, refuse.

929
01:06:30,833 --> 01:06:33,356
Your father was a class
act compared to you.

930
01:06:33,417 --> 01:06:37,522
You're shit on my shoe.
You're a cunt in gold chains.

931
01:06:37,542 --> 01:06:41,727
A misery in size 10 Adidas. Now,
where's your fucking toilet?

932
01:06:47,750 --> 01:06:51,935
- Who designed this place, anyway?
- I did, actually.

933
01:06:52,042 --> 01:06:54,832
It's like a brothel
by way of Elton John.

934
01:06:54,833 --> 01:06:56,901
Stick to thieving and nepotism.

935
01:07:00,167 --> 01:07:02,110
(PEEING)

936
01:07:03,708 --> 01:07:04,980
What are you looking at?

937
01:07:09,083 --> 01:07:10,560
Five minutes left, Dom.

938
01:07:10,708 --> 01:07:13,249
Might be the last time
you piss standing up.

939
01:07:13,250 --> 01:07:16,684
I assume the cables in
the back of the safe

940
01:07:17,167 --> 01:07:19,861
are attached to some
security company.

941
01:07:19,917 --> 01:07:22,486
Yes. They promised a
five-minute response.

942
01:07:22,667 --> 01:07:24,666
I promised not to come
in your sister's mouth.

943
01:07:24,667 --> 01:07:26,916
We all make promises we can't keep.

944
01:07:26,917 --> 01:07:28,519
(BOTH LAUGHING)

945
01:07:38,542 --> 01:07:41,942
Don't worry, I'm not gonna
do anything to Lestor,

946
01:07:42,042 --> 01:07:44,236
as tempting as that may be.

947
01:08:04,667 --> 01:08:06,144
Four minutes,

948
01:08:06,250 --> 01:08:08,457
or less if security comes.

949
01:08:08,458 --> 01:08:12,734
The fastest fingers guy I ever saw took

So what's he trying to do, Dickie?

971

Most safes, the cheap ones
at least, like yours,

972
01:09:14,208 --> 01:09:16,957
if you bounce them enough, there's
a moment when the pins are shaken

973
01:09:16,958 --> 01:09:19,152
and not lined up, even
the electronic ones.

974
01:09:19,167 --> 01:09:22,066
If you're pulling the handle
at that moment, it opens.

975
01:09:22,125 --> 01:09:25,332
Well, nothing's happening here
except Dom getting a fucking hernia.

You did it, Dom. You right did it.

983
01:09:55,125 --> 01:09:57,582
I knew I would. I told you I would.

984
01:09:57,583 --> 01:10:00,666

A glorious tale to be handed down
from generation to generation.

I am impressed, Dom, I must say.

1106
01:19:27,708 --> 01:19:30,527
I was so worried about you.

1107
01:19:30,792 --> 01:19:32,082
But you're OK.

1108
01:19:32,083 --> 01:19:34,291
No, I'm not... I'm not
doing very well, actually.

1109
01:19:34,292 --> 01:19:37,582
You said I'd have good luck.
I've had nothing but shitty luck.

1110
01:19:37,583 --> 01:19:39,916
I'm so sorry to hear that, Dom.

1111
01:19:39,917 --> 01:19:41,166
If I hadn't stopped and helped you,

1112
01:19:41,167 --> 01:19:44,146
I'd have had time to save
my money from being stolen.

1113
01:19:44,167 --> 01:19:47,271
MELODY: But you saved my life.
You stopped to save my life.

1114
01:19:47,292 --> 01:19:49,895
- I know.
- You did the right thing.

1115
01:19:50,083 --> 01:19:52,356
Not everyone would, but you did.

1116
01:19:52,792 --> 01:19:56,457
I told you the good luck would
come when you really need it.

1117
01:19:56,458 --> 01:19:58,481
Well, I really need it.

1118
01:19:58,542 --> 01:20:00,986
- Then it will be.
- How?

1119
01:20:01,583 --> 01:20:03,916
What do you want
most in the world?

1120
01:20:03,917 --> 01:20:06,145
My fucking money!

1121
01:20:07,375 --> 01:20:09,819
- That's what you want most?
- Yes.

1122
01:20:09,875 --> 01:20:11,898
- You sure?
- Yes!

1123
01:20:13,667 --> 01:20:15,440
- Really?
- Yes.

1124
01:20:17,667 --> 01:20:18,768
No.

1125
01:20:26,458 --> 01:20:28,560
I want her to talk to me.

1126
01:20:30,417 --> 01:20:31,894
Forgive me.

1127
01:20:33,958 --> 01:20:35,560
My daughter.

1128
01:20:37,375 --> 01:20:38,943
That seems a little better.

1129
01:20:39,458 --> 01:20:41,026
Yeah, well...

1130
01:20:41,292 --> 01:20:44,666
Just by picking her,
you've already shown

1131
01:20:44,667 --> 01:20:47,566
that the pendulum of luck
is swinging your way.

1132
01:20:47,708 --> 01:20:49,499
What the hell does that mean?

1133
01:20:49,500 --> 01:20:52,353
Love is what you make, Dom.

1134
01:21:08,375 --> 01:21:10,352
DOM: Oh, Keethy.

1135
01:21:15,125 --> 01:21:17,068
I fucked up, didn't I?

1136
01:21:19,792 --> 01:21:22,645
And not one of my
minor Dom fuck-ups.

1137
01:21:23,458 --> 01:21:26,937
Like spending all our money
down the pub with Dickie.

1138
01:21:28,500 --> 01:21:32,025
Going out to a football match
and staying away a week.

1139
01:21:33,667 --> 01:21:37,166
Burning down that housing
estate in Leeds by accident.

1140
01:21:37,167 --> 01:21:38,610
(CHUCKLES)

1141
01:21:39,958 --> 01:21:41,184
No.

1142
01:21:43,583 --> 01:21:45,685
I fucked up royally.

1143
01:21:48,292 --> 01:21:50,895
I didn't get to say goodbye to you.

1144
01:21:53,292 --> 01:21:57,818
I never got to say goodbye and
kiss you goodbye, my sweet girl.

1145
01:22:01,083 --> 01:22:03,166
Now all I got is this dirt,

1146
01:22:03,167 --> 01:22:07,067
fucking grass and dirt in me
hands, and not your sweet face.

1147
01:22:09,458 --> 01:22:11,652
Your sweet, beautiful face.

1148
01:22:16,667 --> 01:22:18,565
(SOBS)

1149
01:22:19,667 --> 01:22:21,610
I was a stupid fool.

1150
01:22:23,583 --> 01:22:25,151
I lost you.

1151
01:22:27,250 --> 01:22:30,194
I lost out on our
Evelyn's childhood.

1152
01:22:31,792 --> 01:22:34,975
I lost the two most important
things in my life.

1153
01:22:36,750 --> 01:22:38,693
And now you're gone...

1154
01:22:39,958 --> 01:22:41,901
and our Evie...

1155
01:22:44,792 --> 01:22:46,485
she hates me.

1156
01:22:51,125 --> 01:22:52,898
Oh, Keethy...

1157
01:22:54,458 --> 01:22:57,858
Beautiful, sweet Keethy. My life.

1158
01:23:00,792 --> 01:23:02,269
My heart.

1159
01:23:16,875 --> 01:23:19,728
I'm gonna try and make
things better with Evelyn.

1160
01:23:19,958 --> 01:23:21,526
I really am.

1161
01:23:23,625 --> 01:23:25,773
She hates me now

1162
01:23:27,167 --> 01:23:29,315
but I'll wear her down,

1163
01:23:29,667 --> 01:23:31,235
bit by bit.

1164
01:23:33,583 --> 01:23:35,230
Day by day.

1165
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:39,559
Hour by hour, I'll seduce
her with my kindness.

1166
01:23:41,042 --> 01:23:45,227
I'll blanket her in
warmth and security.

1167
01:23:47,625 --> 01:23:50,478
I'll confound her with my decency.

1168
01:23:52,667 --> 01:23:55,737
She'll resist my charms
for only so long.

1169
01:23:57,583 --> 01:23:59,981
After all, I'm Dom Hemingway.

1170
01:24:02,750 --> 01:24:04,693
I'm Dom Hemingway.

1171
01:24:08,083 --> 01:24:09,810
I'm your Dom.

1172
01:24:09,917 --> 01:24:11,519
(RUSTLING)

1173
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:22,353
Come here. Sit down.

1174
01:24:25,250 --> 01:24:27,023
Give us your hand.

1175
01:24:29,833 --> 01:24:33,358
That's your grandmother.
Keethy, or Katherine.

1176
01:24:38,583 --> 01:24:43,314
She never much liked the dark ones, but
I think she'd have really liked you.

1177
01:25:09,458 --> 01:25:11,166
I didn't think you'd come.

1178
01:25:11,167 --> 01:25:13,541
Couldn't well take the
bus himself, could he?

1179
01:25:13,542 --> 01:25:14,985
(CHUCKLES)

1180
01:25:16,375 --> 01:25:18,523
Can I walk with you a bit?

1181
01:25:19,042 --> 01:25:21,065
In silence, I promise.

1182
01:25:21,292 --> 01:25:23,582
Total silence, like... Like a mime.

1183
01:25:23,583 --> 01:25:26,857
Like an old lady who lives
in an attic on her own

1184
01:25:27,458 --> 01:25:30,107
and stuffs her cats
after they died.

1185
01:25:36,667 --> 01:25:38,269
Not today.

1186
01:25:45,375 --> 01:25:47,819
Someday, then, eh, maybe?

1187
01:25:53,708 --> 01:25:56,402
You can walk Jawara to school
on Monday morning if you like.

1188
01:25:57,875 --> 01:25:59,898
If you can wake up that early.

1189
01:26:00,292 --> 01:26:02,986
Don't get too pissed
the night before.

1190
01:26:09,167 --> 01:26:10,689
Right, then.

1191
01:27:04,167 --> 01:27:06,816
Well, I'll be the Vatican's cunt.

1192
01:27:12,083 --> 01:27:14,874
I'll see you later.
Right, let's go in.

1193
01:27:14,875 --> 01:27:16,568
(PAOLINA CHUCKLES)

1194
01:27:17,375 --> 01:27:19,603
(INDISTINCT CONVERSATION)

1195
01:27:35,083 --> 01:27:37,686
Paolina! Hello, darling.

1196
01:27:40,208 --> 01:27:43,332
Fancy seeing you here in London.
Why didn't you call me?

1197
01:27:43,333 --> 01:27:44,957
We could have gone out for a drink,

1198
01:27:44,958 --> 01:27:47,416
had a tone-deaf sing-along
to some old records.

1199
01:27:47,417 --> 01:27:49,315
Paolina, who is this?

1200
01:27:49,708 --> 01:27:51,685
I don't know who this man is.

1201
01:27:51,958 --> 01:27:53,605
Oh... (LAUGHS)

1202
01:27:54,083 --> 01:27:56,026
I'll tell you who I am.

1203
01:27:56,250 --> 01:27:59,900
I'm the fucker who'll tear
your nose off with my teeth.

1204
01:28:00,500 --> 01:28:03,874
I'm the fucker who will gut
you with a dull cheese knife

1205
01:28:03,875 --> 01:28:06,291
and sing Gilbert and
Sullivan while I do it.

1206
01:28:06,292 --> 01:28:10,291
I'm the fucker who'll dump your
dead body in a freezing cold lake

1207
01:28:10,292 --> 01:28:13,646
and watch you sink to the
bottom like so much shit.

1208
01:28:14,583 --> 01:28:16,310
I am that fucker.

1209
01:28:17,417 --> 01:28:19,235
That's the fucker who I am.

1210
01:28:20,375 --> 01:28:24,105
And if you say one word
when I remove my hand,

1211
01:28:24,500 --> 01:28:26,499
I'll do all that to you right now.

1212
01:28:26,500 --> 01:28:30,957
You say one word and you'll be as useless
as a dried-up, fetid condom after bad sex.

1213
01:28:30,958 --> 01:28:32,916
Do I make myself clear?

1214
01:28:32,917 --> 01:28:34,707
Do my words translate to you?

1215
01:28:34,708 --> 01:28:37,061
If you understand my words, nod.

1216
01:28:39,292 --> 01:28:40,814
That's good.

1217
01:28:42,292 --> 01:28:46,272
After much heartbreak and ruin,

1218
01:28:47,542 --> 01:28:51,522
the pendulum of luck has finally
swung back to Dom Hemingway.

1219
01:28:53,083 --> 01:28:56,767
And I intend to enjoy each
moment of its fickle pleasure,

1220
01:28:57,042 --> 01:29:00,942
whether it lasts for a minute,
a day or a lifetime.
