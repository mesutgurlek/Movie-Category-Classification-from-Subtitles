00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:46,675
Someone who can't distinguish
between right and wrong is like a child.

- What?
- <i>(Carrie)</i> Karma.

You know, when you do
something bad to someone...

307
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:17,192
...and fate pays you back
by something bad happening to you?

308
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:20,312

00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:56,518
His parole officer.

Oh, right. Talked to you on the phone.

- Yeah, could be.

- I don't know. Crazy son of a bitch...

Without his car?

325
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:19,439
What about the owner of the house,
this, um... Mr John Diebold?

326

<i>Primitive, but harmless.</i>

Here you go, Bri.
I got chips and some jerky here.

338
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:19,870
If you want 'em, just holler.

339
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:28,392
Just in case.

<i>From the moment I began</i>

<i>one question over and over.</i>

342
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:40,359
<i>What's the difference</i>
<i>between a killer and any one of us?</i>

343
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:43,358
<i>What was it they had... or didn't have...</i>

344

<i>... that separated them from us?</i>

345
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:49,510
The Novaks are long gone.

346
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:52,598
But the white picket fence
they hired Michael Zeruba to put up...

347
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:54,712
...is still here.

- <i>(Brian)</i> The Novaks...
- Hey, you two.

00:27:24,280 --> 00:27:26,350
Come on, show your love!

350
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:37,949
The Novaks embraced the young drifter
as one of their own.

351
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:43,591
The neighbours said
he was a quiet young man...

352
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:47,599
...who was often seen pushing
the children on the swing set.

353
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:51,509
Everything was fine until the day
the Novaks ran out of work for Michael...

354
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:54,108
...and had to ask him to leave.

355
00:27:54,560 --> 00:27:59,429
How does a man get to the point where
he can kill a human being in cold blood?

356
00:27:59,560 --> 00:28:02,518
Early, could you move
out of the way, please?

357
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:12,237
The first to die
was the nine-year-old daughter.

358
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:21,799
Hi, I'm Brian Kessler. What's your name?

359
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:29,032

Pa, where are you?

361
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:38,553
Pa! There's somebody at the door
who wants to see you.

362
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:41,599
- <i>(man)</i> What? Who is it?
- <i>(girl)</i> I don't know.

363
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:44,951
Afternoon, sir. I'm sorry to wake you. Uh...

364
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:47,036
My name is Brian Kessler.

365
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:50,510
I'm a writer.

366
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:55,430
I'm workin' on a book on some of
the famous murders in American history.

367
00:28:55,560 --> 00:28:58,199
I'm sure you're aware
that this is the Novak farm.

368
00:28:59,080 --> 00:29:03,198
I was wondering if my girlfriend Carrie
could come in and take a few pictures?

369
00:29:03,560 --> 00:29:07,519
I'll walk around, tape some notes and
we'll be out of your hair in five minutes.

370
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:11,070
I'd like to maybe just walk around
the house and get a feel for it.

371
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:12,918
Goddamn ghouls.

372
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:17,279
We drove all day to get here, sir.
I'd be out of your hair in five minutes, sir.

373
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:19,516
Five minutes!

374
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:25,436
Brian, come on.

375
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:29,916
Let's forget about it. Come on.

376
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:36,835
<i>At the time, I was angry that</i>
<i>Mr Baxter slammed the door in my face.</i>

377
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:39,110
<i>But it was just his way of forgetting...</i>

378
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:43,279
<i>... of pretending that nothing terrible</i>
<i>had ever happened there.</i>

379
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:47,473
<i>I guess it's only natural to try</i>
<i>and forget the bad things that happen.</i>

380
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:49,556
<i>You never really do, though.</i>

381
00:30:09,320 --> 00:30:11,276
We've come 480 miles so far.

382
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:16,392
- Not bad for a day's haul, huh?
- Pretty good.

383
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:20,199
You got any family or friends
in California, Early?

384
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:23,710
- No. Do you? You do?
- No, I don't.

385
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:29,509
Do you have any friends or family
in California, Carrie?

386
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:32,074
What? Um, no.

387
00:30:33,280 --> 00:30:34,395
No.

388
00:30:34,520 --> 00:30:37,796
Well, that's OK.
At least we all got each other, right?

389
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:41,672
I mean, that's somethin'.

390
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:48,549
My momma used to say that
when you have people around you...

391
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:53,436
...it's better that you're not by yourself,
because when you're alone...

392
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:55,676
...it's hard to develop your personality.

393
00:30:56,000 --> 00:31:00,949
With more people around you, it helps,
cos friends are really important and...

394
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:04,476
- Thank you.
- Thanks, bro.

395
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:07,478
We'll get the next one.
We gotta hit the sack.

396
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:09,990
Let's go, momma.

397
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:15,029
- Have sweet dreams.
- Night, Adele.

398
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:19,156
Night, Early.

399
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:25,914
That's funny.
I didn't know you were so prejudiced.

400
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:28,998
Because I object to having
somebody take off their shoe...

401
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:33,159
...and scratch their foot
while I'm eating... I'm prejudiced?

402
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:36,670
He can't help the way he was raised.
I kinda feel sorry for him.

403
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:40,628
You feel sorry for him. That's so sweet.

404
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:44,832
Obviously you didn't get
a whiff of that sock!

405
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:47,795
Bitch, bitch, bitch.

406
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:56,039
30 bucks for a motel. For what?

407
00:31:56,200 --> 00:32:00,478
A lumpy mattress, a crummy TV
and a crapper? Don't think so!

408
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:05,111
- Honey, sing me a song.
- I'm busy, momma. Just stay put.

409
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:07,316
Please?

410
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:12,275
OK, if you don't sing it,
I'm gonna sing it myself.

411
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:15,631
Do

412
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:18,752
Do your balls hang low?
Do they wobble to and fro?

413
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:21,952
Can you tie 'em in a knot?
Can you tie 'em in a bow?

414
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:25,550
And put 'em over your shoulder
Like a continental soldier?

you take me to that Chinese restaurant...

417

...where all them footprints
are out in front?

418
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,912
Only if they let me put mine down, too.

419
00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:47,799
Pretty smooth how they stiffed us
on dinner, though.

420
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:54,756
He didn't stiff us.
He paid for the gas, remember?

421
00:32:55,960 --> 00:33:00,158
Brian, I am telling you...
I am telling you they're almost broke...

422
00:33:00,280 --> 00:33:03,352

- Oh. Yeah.

should smoke or drink or cuss.

- He hacked 'em up?
- In two pieces, yeah. In half.

Anybody who did that
must have enjoyed it.

513
00:44:30,720 --> 00:44:35,316
He would have done it again and again
and again until somebody stopped him.

<i>But he's alive, see.</i>

1221
01:47:55,440 --> 01:47:57,795
<i>Now, he's thinkin' about what he done...</i>

1222
01:47:57,920 --> 01:48:02,118
<i>... goin' over it and over it and over it</i>
<i>in his head, every night...</i>

1223
01:48:02,240 --> 01:48:05,391
<i>... thinkin' how smart he is</i>
<i>for gettin' away with it.</i>

1224
01:48:06,120 --> 01:48:08,076
<i>Thinkin'.</i>

1225
01:48:11,160 --> 01:48:13,549
Hey, how's it goin'?

1226
01:48:13,680 --> 01:48:16,399
Not bad. How was your swim?

1227
01:48:17,240 --> 01:48:20,312
- It's freezing.

01:48:22,400 --> 01:48:24,197
I know.

1229
01:48:27,960 --> 01:48:30,554
There's, um... this gallery in Venice...

1230
01:48:30,680 --> 01:48:33,911
...and I showed them my work,
the icon series.

1231
01:48:34,040 --> 01:48:36,634
- I think they're interested.
- That's great.

1232
01:48:36,760 --> 01:48:39,718
Well, it's not definite, but it's encouraging.

1233
01:48:42,080 --> 01:48:44,469
Well, let's celebrate. I'll take you to lunch.

1234
01:48:44,760 --> 01:48:46,830
OK.

1235
01:48:47,400 --> 01:48:51,393
- So what happens next?
- Well, I have a meeting at the gallery...

1236
01:48:51,520 --> 01:48:55,115
...and they want to see
some more of my work. So...
