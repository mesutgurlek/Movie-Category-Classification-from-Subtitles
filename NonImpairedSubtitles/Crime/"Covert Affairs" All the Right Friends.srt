1
00:00:04,575 --> 00:00:07,948
This is how any properly executed
spy exchange should go.

2
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:11,075
You take delivery of the
prisoner at the airport.

3
00:00:11,284 --> 00:00:13,084
In this case,
one Carlo Reni,

4
00:00:13,152 --> 00:00:16,888
Italian A.I.S.E.,
recently arrested by the FBI

5
00:00:16,956 --> 00:00:18,356
for domestic spying.

6
00:00:18,424 --> 00:00:23,022
Yes, Dorothy,
allies spy on allies.

7
00:00:25,422 --> 00:00:31,187
♪ ♪

8
00:00:31,255 --> 00:00:35,127
You will fly to the designated
exchange location in Argentina,

9
00:00:35,195 --> 00:00:37,899
which, by the way,
is gorgeous in the summer.

10
00:00:37,967 --> 00:00:40,302
But it's summer here now,
meaning--

11
00:00:40,370 --> 00:00:42,542
oh, well, you'll see.

12
00:00:42,610 --> 00:00:45,007
You will land at a lovely
little bit of paradise

13
00:00:45,075 --> 00:00:47,209
in the middle of nowhere,

14
00:00:47,276 --> 00:00:49,410
90 miles as the crow flies
northeast of Buenos Aires.

15
00:00:49,478 --> 00:00:52,317
Perfect for the quiet,
off-the-record,

16
00:00:52,385 --> 00:00:55,354
slightly frosty exchange
of foreign operatives.

17
00:00:55,422 --> 00:00:59,592
You will then make the exchange
just as you made the pickup.

18
00:00:59,660 --> 00:01:00,828
You'll be on the ground
all of five minutes

19
00:01:00,896 --> 00:01:03,131
and everyone returns home.

20
00:01:03,199 --> 00:01:04,998
Easy-peasy--
that's how it's done.

21
00:01:05,066 --> 00:01:06,867
So, Annie Walker,

22
00:01:06,935 --> 00:01:10,739
have yourself a lovely flight.

23
00:01:26,594 --> 00:01:29,495
You speak Italian?

24
00:01:29,563 --> 00:01:31,297
Interesting.

25
00:01:31,365 --> 00:01:34,232
Blonde, Nordic forehead,

26
00:01:34,300 --> 00:01:37,601
and lovely mediterranean eyes.

27
00:01:37,669 --> 00:01:41,704
You have a drop
of Italian in you maybe?

28
00:01:41,772 --> 00:01:43,039
I'm American.

29
00:01:43,107 --> 00:01:44,407
But before that.

30
00:01:44,474 --> 00:01:47,976
Before that,
I was American.

31
00:01:48,044 --> 00:01:49,711
Hmm.

32
00:01:49,779 --> 00:01:51,214
And you--

33
00:01:51,281 --> 00:01:53,949
darker features,
which suggest Southern Italy,

34
00:01:54,017 --> 00:01:56,285
which is rare for a spy,
but your dialect

35
00:01:56,353 --> 00:01:57,987
is actually Romano.

36
00:01:58,054 --> 00:02:00,490
Roma, of course--
there is no south in me.

37
00:02:00,557 --> 00:02:02,659
Below Roma,
it's mostly peasants.

38
00:02:02,727 --> 00:02:04,761
And I'm not a spy.
I'm a journalist.

39
00:02:04,829 --> 00:02:06,630
Right.

40
00:02:06,697 --> 00:02:08,566
<i>Per favore, signorina,</i>

41
00:02:08,634 --> 00:02:11,736
it is very hard for an Italian
to talk without his hands.

42
00:02:11,803 --> 00:02:13,537
Forget it.

43
00:02:22,615 --> 00:02:24,650
Maybe I will have
some peanuts.

44
00:02:50,946 --> 00:02:52,613
Sit tight.

45
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:55,649
I'll be back.

46
00:03:08,161 --> 00:03:09,828
I-I said sit tight.

47
00:03:09,896 --> 00:03:12,098
That's not something
I'm good at--sit tight.

48
00:03:12,166 --> 00:03:15,535
Fine.
Stay close.

49
00:03:20,775 --> 00:03:22,410
So how does
a woman like you

50
00:03:22,477 --> 00:03:25,780
end up in a dirty trade
like this?

51
00:03:25,848 --> 00:03:30,518
Is it God, country,
apple cake?

52
00:03:30,586 --> 00:03:32,654
- Pie.
- Excuse me?

53
00:03:32,722 --> 00:03:35,390
God, country, apple pie.

54
00:03:35,458 --> 00:03:37,026
Cake is better.

55
00:03:37,093 --> 00:03:39,128
Or <i>panna cotta.</i>
Oh!

56
00:03:39,195 --> 00:03:41,063
God, country,
and <i>panna cotta.</i>

57
00:03:41,131 --> 00:03:43,132
- Annie.
- We're on the ground.

58
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:45,468
Welcome to sunny Argentina.
How was your flight?

59
00:03:45,536 --> 00:03:47,070
Talkative.

60
00:03:47,137 --> 00:03:49,172
But not hard on the eyes,
I'm told.

61
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:52,308
I didn't notice.

62
00:03:52,376 --> 00:03:53,877
Well, of course not.
Neither would I.

63
00:03:53,944 --> 00:03:57,079
Auggie, where's our contact?

64
00:03:57,147 --> 00:03:58,347
We're here alone.

65
00:03:58,415 --> 00:03:59,615
Out dealing with weather.

66
00:03:59,683 --> 00:04:01,517
Hurricane-force winds
in the South Atlantic.

67
00:04:01,585 --> 00:04:03,452
They were forced to land
in the Falklands.

68
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:05,821
The Falklands
is 250 miles from here.

69
00:04:05,889 --> 00:04:07,856
Well, you're in paradise
with a handsome Italian.

70
00:04:07,924 --> 00:04:10,191
Adapt, overcome,
make small talk.

71
00:04:10,259 --> 00:04:12,227
- That's your advice?
- Sorry.

72
00:04:12,295 --> 00:04:13,762
Late night.

73
00:04:13,830 --> 00:04:17,667
Uh, they do expect
to be wheels up,

74
00:04:17,734 --> 00:04:21,737
hopefully within two hours,
weather permitting.

75
00:04:21,805 --> 00:04:23,873
Perfect.

76
00:04:23,941 --> 00:04:25,541
Excuse me?

77
00:04:25,609 --> 00:04:27,176
I got to go.

78
00:04:27,244 --> 00:04:30,046
Don't be a stranger.

79
00:04:30,114 --> 00:04:31,748
Really, Carlo?

80
00:04:31,816 --> 00:04:33,016
Oh!

81
00:04:33,084 --> 00:04:34,751
There's nothing
around here for miles.

82
00:04:41,525 --> 00:04:43,193
Where do you think
you're going?

83
00:04:43,261 --> 00:04:45,228
Oh!
Ow!

84
00:04:47,565 --> 00:04:49,800
What were you gonna do--
run all the way to Buenos Aires?

85
00:04:49,867 --> 00:04:52,702
Ugh, if I have to.

86
00:04:52,770 --> 00:04:54,938
No, no, no, no, no, no.
I'm not going back to Italy.

87
00:04:55,005 --> 00:04:56,339
There are people there

88
00:04:56,407 --> 00:04:57,940
who are very anxious
to silence me.

89
00:04:58,008 --> 00:04:59,509
You saying
there's something worse

90
00:04:59,576 --> 00:05:01,443
than the CIA waiting for you?
Oh, you don't believe me?

91
00:05:01,511 --> 00:05:04,046
My job is to deliver
you safely,

92
00:05:04,114 --> 00:05:06,081
and that's what I'm gonna do.

93
00:05:08,885 --> 00:05:10,352
You know, I changed my mind.

94
00:05:10,420 --> 00:05:12,087
There is nothing Italian
about you.

95
00:05:19,762 --> 00:05:20,963
Run.

96
00:05:21,030 --> 00:05:23,132
- What?
- Run!

You don't have a gun?
No.

My agency is no doubt talking
to your agency right now,

103
00:06:30,792 --> 00:06:32,359
consulting
with the Argentineans

104

Come on.
Let's go.

107
00:06:38,766 --> 00:06:40,400
This is a disaster.

108
00:06:40,468 --> 00:06:43,069
This was a favor, Joan.
A professional courtesy...

109
00:06:43,136 --> 00:06:44,737
I'm aware of that.

110
00:06:44,804 --> 00:06:47,139
Based on personal assurances
and our long friendship!

111
00:06:47,206 --> 00:06:49,274
May I suggest
you take a breath, Jorge?

112
00:06:49,341 --> 00:06:50,975
No, Romano,
I will not take a breath,

113
00:06:51,043 --> 00:06:53,044
and I take exception to that!

114
00:06:53,111 --> 00:06:56,513
I was made assurances this
would be a simple proposition.

115
00:06:56,581 --> 00:07:00,084
Two allies, simple exchange,
30 minutes tops.

116
00:07:00,151 --> 00:07:02,719
Now I have
two international spies

117
00:07:02,787 --> 00:07:04,588
and an assassin
loose in my country!

118
00:07:04,656 --> 00:07:06,890
And we have every intention
of rectifying that, Jorge.

119
00:07:06,958 --> 00:07:09,059
- Really? How?
- Please, I won't be snapped at!

120
00:07:09,127 --> 00:07:10,527
We are each
in a predicament here.

121
00:07:10,595 --> 00:07:12,862
<i>Ay, dios mio!</i>
What predicament are you in?

122
00:07:12,930 --> 00:07:14,998
- Gentlemen, please.
- My hands are tied, Joan.

123
00:07:15,066 --> 00:07:17,233
It would be one thing
if we shared the details

124
00:07:17,301 --> 00:07:20,536
with our departments of state,
but I was asked not to.

125
00:07:20,604 --> 00:07:22,805
What are you saying, Jorge?

126
00:07:22,873 --> 00:07:25,674
I like my job.
I plan to keep it.

127
00:07:25,742 --> 00:07:27,843
If I catch either operative,

128
00:07:27,911 --> 00:07:29,978
I will arrest them
as foreign spies.

129
00:07:30,046 --> 00:07:31,980
That would mean jail.

130
00:07:32,048 --> 00:07:33,715
- You're being a fool.
- I'm sorry, Joan.

131
00:07:33,783 --> 00:07:36,584
You would do the same
if you were in my shoes.

132
00:07:36,652 --> 00:07:38,854
Signal's gone.

133
00:07:38,921 --> 00:07:41,690
Huh.
Both signals.

134
00:07:41,758 --> 00:07:43,125
That was...

135
00:07:43,192 --> 00:07:44,893
Interesting.

136
00:07:44,961 --> 00:07:48,731
What do you want to do?

137
00:07:48,799 --> 00:07:51,067
I have a feeling our
domestic colleagues at the FBI

138
00:07:51,135 --> 00:07:52,769
haven't been
completely forthright with us

139
00:07:52,837 --> 00:07:54,905
about our Mr. Reni.
I'm on it.

140
00:07:54,973 --> 00:07:57,340
State?
Open a back channel?

141
00:07:57,408 --> 00:07:59,509
- No, not yet.
- Liaise with the D.O.D.?

142
00:07:59,577 --> 00:08:01,478
I have a different duty
for you--you're to see Arthur.

143
00:08:01,545 --> 00:08:03,113
- We're in the middle of an op.
- Mm-hmm.

144
00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:05,115
And Jai's gonna handle it.
Annie's in good hands.

145
00:08:05,182 --> 00:08:06,783
Arthur's waiting for you.

146
00:08:25,971 --> 00:08:28,506
Oh!
Whew!

147

I-I-I--

148
00:08:35,915 --> 00:08:39,018
I had a tryout
with A.C. Fiorentina--

149
00:08:39,085 --> 00:08:40,519
yeah, midfielder.

150
00:08:40,586 --> 00:08:42,453
I hurt my knee, and they still
wanted to sign me, but--

151
00:08:42,521 --> 00:08:44,656
We need to keep moving.
I don't want to lose the light.

152
00:08:44,723 --> 00:08:46,191
- Ah, well, we need a plan.
- I have a plan.

153
00:08:46,258 --> 00:08:47,492
I don't trust your plan.

154
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:49,327
Well, I don't remember
asking you to.

155
00:08:49,395 --> 00:08:50,795
I know the perfect place.

156
00:08:50,863 --> 00:08:52,731
I have friends
in a little beach town

157
00:08:52,799 --> 00:08:55,167
outside Mar del Plata--
Italian.

158
00:08:55,235 --> 00:08:57,369
Neapolitan,
but they're good people.

00:09:02,810 --> 00:09:04,311

- It's really good.

162
00:09:04,379 --> 00:09:05,712
- It's protocol.
- Protocol?

163
00:09:05,780 --> 00:09:07,414
Yeah, which already saved
your life once.

164
00:09:07,482 --> 00:09:09,483
Uh-huh, yeah,
I realize your boss requires

165
00:09:09,551 --> 00:09:11,852
a blind allegiance
and slavish devotion, okay?

166
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:13,421
We don't have time for this.

167
00:09:13,488 --> 00:09:15,456
But I know for a fact
that your agency's in league

168
00:09:15,524 --> 00:09:16,991
with the people
who are trying to kill me.

169
00:09:17,059 --> 00:09:18,292
You understand?
You're like a dog with a bone.

170
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:19,960
And I know
that I'm absolutely right.

171
00:09:20,028 --> 00:09:21,829
- You're not right.
- Absolutely.

172
00:09:21,897 --> 00:09:23,196
Not this time.

173
00:09:23,264 --> 00:09:24,431
Now, please.

174
00:09:24,499 --> 00:09:25,933
To where?

175
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,736
I'm gonna take you to
a safe location in Buenos Aires.

176
00:09:28,804 --> 00:09:30,270
- Oh, okay.
- Once there, I check in.

177
00:09:30,338 --> 00:09:32,406
If everything's okay, I'll take
you to the Italian embassy.

178
00:09:32,473 --> 00:09:34,174
Hey, hey, no.

179
00:09:34,241 --> 00:09:35,975
- Yes.
- Ah!

180
00:09:39,348 --> 00:09:40,948
Nightmare.
Don't worry.

181
00:09:41,016 --> 00:09:42,683
By tonight, you'll be home
safe in Italy,

182
00:09:42,751 --> 00:09:44,118
and all this will be over.

183
00:09:46,189 --> 00:09:48,824
I don't know how people
like you sleep at night.

184
00:09:48,892 --> 00:09:52,028
I know you felt
you owed me, sir,

185
00:09:52,096 --> 00:09:54,698
but a promotion?

186
00:09:54,766 --> 00:09:57,802
This would be a substantial
change in your life--

187
00:09:57,869 --> 00:10:00,471
a staff, your own office
on the seventh floor.

188
00:10:00,538 --> 00:10:03,874
Whoa. A view.

189
00:10:03,942 --> 00:10:07,078
A bump in grade means
a bump in pay--

190
00:10:07,146 --> 00:10:08,681
a significant one.

191
00:10:08,748 --> 00:10:10,683
Next, you're gonna offer me
a new parking space.

192
00:10:12,186 --> 00:10:15,455
Two spaces down from mine.

193
00:10:15,523 --> 00:10:17,089
Two spaces south
is the D.D.I.

194
00:10:17,157 --> 00:10:19,559
He's not going anywhere.

195
00:10:19,626 --> 00:10:22,895
Two spaces north...

196
00:10:22,963 --> 00:10:24,964
Office
of Congressional Affairs?

197
00:10:25,032 --> 00:10:27,566
We think you'd be perfect.

198
00:10:27,634 --> 00:10:29,034
You want me in O.C.A.?

199
00:10:29,102 --> 00:10:31,304
We want you to run O.C.A.

200
00:10:31,372 --> 00:10:32,906
Charlie's going green badge.

201
00:10:32,973 --> 00:10:36,609
He's got kids
to put through college.

202
00:10:36,677 --> 00:10:41,481
Plus, it's time for newer blood,
younger blood.

203
00:10:41,549 --> 00:10:42,783
Well, that would mean--

204
00:10:42,850 --> 00:10:45,352
Yes, Auggie.

205
00:10:45,420 --> 00:10:48,589
You'd be overt.

206
00:10:48,656 --> 00:10:51,258
I could never go
in the field again.

207
00:10:51,326 --> 00:10:52,659
Yeah, that's right.

208
00:10:52,727 --> 00:10:57,431
Once you step in front
of the cameras, it's--

209
00:10:57,499 --> 00:11:00,835
I remember when I did it.

210
00:11:00,902 --> 00:11:03,070
It was a big step.

211
00:11:03,138 --> 00:11:06,073
You'd be one of three
public faces for the CIA--

212
00:11:06,141 --> 00:11:09,143
the D.C.I., me, and you.

213
00:11:11,914 --> 00:11:14,282
Here I thought
I was in trouble.

214
00:11:14,349 --> 00:11:15,917
Oh, this is a hell
of an opportunity--

215
00:11:15,984 --> 00:11:17,585
a career maker.

216
00:11:17,653 --> 00:11:21,023
And honestly...

217
00:11:21,090 --> 00:11:23,157
We're not exactly pulling you
from the field.

218
00:11:23,225 --> 00:11:26,861
The D.C.I. and I agree.

219
00:11:26,929 --> 00:11:29,297
We both think you are
the right man for the job.

220
00:11:34,470 --> 00:11:35,570
I'm speechless.

221
00:11:35,638 --> 00:11:37,705
Well, you'd have
to work on that.

222
00:11:37,773 --> 00:11:40,542
You can't be speechless
on this job.

223
00:11:40,610 --> 00:11:43,879
- When?
- You'd start next week.

224
00:11:43,947 --> 00:11:46,315
So you need to give it
some serious thought.

225
00:12:07,239 --> 00:12:10,342
Carlo Reni was arrested
by the FBI two days ago

226
00:12:10,409 --> 00:12:12,611
for reading the trash
at the Bureau of Land Management

227
00:12:12,679 --> 00:12:14,112
here in D.C.

228
00:12:14,180 --> 00:12:15,581
He said he was investigating
a story for--

229
00:12:15,648 --> 00:12:16,815
I know.
I know.

230
00:12:16,883 --> 00:12:18,150
He stuck to his cover.
I know this.

231
00:12:18,218 --> 00:12:19,351
Tell me what I don't know.

232
00:12:19,419 --> 00:12:21,587
The FBI had him
all of five hours

233
00:12:21,655 --> 00:12:23,890
before the Italian A.I.S.E.
offered up a trade.

234
00:12:23,957 --> 00:12:25,825
Did you know that?
No.

235
00:12:25,893 --> 00:12:27,961
Which means, of course--

236
00:12:28,029 --> 00:12:29,796
His own agency
blew his cover.

237
00:12:29,863 --> 00:12:32,498
- He knows something.
- What?

238
00:12:32,566 --> 00:12:35,101
He said he was only
in the country for five days

239
00:12:35,168 --> 00:12:36,468
before he was arrested.

240
00:12:36,536 --> 00:12:39,004
- Where was he before that?
- A lot of traveling--

241
00:12:39,072 --> 00:12:41,373
mostly South America,
working his cover.

242
00:12:41,441 --> 00:12:43,308
Before that,
some Middle East visits.

243
00:12:43,376 --> 00:12:45,911
He was kicked out of Iran
for publishing articles

244
00:12:45,978 --> 00:12:49,580
"Libelous and unfavorable
to the government."

245
00:12:49,648 --> 00:12:51,082
What does Persia House say?

246
00:12:51,150 --> 00:12:53,684
That he was kicked out
for his story, ostensibly.

247
00:12:53,752 --> 00:12:54,985
They have him on a watch list.

248
00:12:55,053 --> 00:12:59,890
Get Genaro.
I want a face-to-face.

249
00:12:59,957 --> 00:13:01,491
Auggie.
Joan.

250
00:13:01,559 --> 00:13:03,193
Good meeting?

251
00:13:03,261 --> 00:13:05,029
Interesting meeting.

252
00:13:05,096 --> 00:13:07,531
What can I do?

253
00:13:07,599 --> 00:13:09,767
I want confirmation that
there is a jet on the ground

254
00:13:09,835 --> 00:13:11,269
in the Falklands.

255
00:13:11,337 --> 00:13:13,104
I want to know whether or not
we're being played.

256
00:13:13,172 --> 00:13:14,506
I can do that.

257
00:13:14,573 --> 00:13:17,876
And someone please find out
who the opposition is.

258
00:13:17,943 --> 00:13:19,310
If we have a hitter
in the field,

259
00:13:19,378 --> 00:13:20,445
I want to know who it is.

260
00:13:34,659 --> 00:13:36,626
And this is probably
where you steal

261
00:13:36,694 --> 00:13:39,195
some hapless peasant's vehicle,

262
00:13:39,263 --> 00:13:40,763
his only worldly possession--
typical.

263
00:13:40,831 --> 00:13:44,067
Actually, this is where
I buy it.

264
00:13:44,135 --> 00:13:46,469
<i>Buenos dias!</i>

265
00:13:52,409 --> 00:13:56,145
But you would have
stolen it.

266
00:13:56,212 --> 00:13:57,913
Let me drive.
I know the way.

267
00:14:01,084 --> 00:14:02,884
In Italy,
a woman never drives.

268
00:14:02,952 --> 00:14:04,720
The man drives.

269
00:14:04,788 --> 00:14:07,656
We're not in Italy.

270
00:14:07,723 --> 00:14:09,291
Fine.

271
00:14:09,359 --> 00:14:12,961
Get us lost.
We're not lost.

272
00:14:13,028 --> 00:14:15,263
It's only a matter of time.

273
00:14:24,172 --> 00:14:25,339
Auggie?

274
00:14:25,407 --> 00:14:27,675
Got a signal, I think,

275
00:14:27,742 --> 00:14:30,210
at least that's
what N.G.A. tells me,

276
00:14:30,278 --> 00:14:32,312
but they might be playing
with me.

277
00:14:32,380 --> 00:14:34,848
Officially,
it's in customs' hold.

278
00:14:34,915 --> 00:14:37,017
Passengers and crew
are still aboard.

279
00:14:37,085 --> 00:14:38,652
Can we get eyes
on the ground?

280
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:39,987
Working on it.

281
00:14:40,055 --> 00:14:41,489
What about Genaro
at the Italian embassy?

282
00:14:41,557 --> 00:14:43,024
I'm making arrangements.

283
00:14:43,091 --> 00:14:44,626
Word is, he'd like
to speak with you, too.

284
00:14:44,693 --> 00:14:46,027
Good.

285
00:14:46,095 --> 00:14:48,797
- Anything on our hitter?
- One possible--

286
00:14:48,865 --> 00:14:50,666
a Helmut Drum.

287
00:14:50,734 --> 00:14:52,869
He arrived in Buenos Aires

288
00:14:52,936 --> 00:14:55,838
on a flight from London
yesterday morning--

289
00:14:55,906 --> 00:14:57,840
former Chechen separatist,

290
00:14:57,907 --> 00:15:00,109
noted involvement
in death squads,

291
00:15:00,177 --> 00:15:02,912
ties to the usual
unsavory suspects,

292
00:15:02,979 --> 00:15:04,813
mostly Eastern Europe.

293
00:15:04,881 --> 00:15:07,348
It's believed
he's independent.

294
00:15:07,416 --> 00:15:09,250
European ties,
anglo appearance

295
00:15:09,318 --> 00:15:10,818
makes him a good commodity
in certain markets.

296
00:15:10,886 --> 00:15:12,620
Now he's in Argentina.

297
00:15:12,688 --> 00:15:14,655
He fits Annie's description.

298
00:15:14,723 --> 00:15:18,093
I profiled this guy
for the U.K. desk.

299
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:19,394
He is not
a true believer anymore.

300
00:15:19,462 --> 00:15:20,896
He is all about the money.

301
00:15:20,963 --> 00:15:23,699
He's the real deal.
Let's give Annie a heads-up.

302
00:15:23,767 --> 00:15:25,501
Already tried.
Can't reach her.

303
00:15:25,569 --> 00:15:27,370
- Try again.
- Yep.

304
00:15:57,924 --> 00:16:00,158
This wouldn't happen
if you let me drive.

305
00:16:16,136 --> 00:16:18,370
I would kill for a macchiato.

306
00:16:18,438 --> 00:16:20,840
Speaking of which...

307
00:16:20,907 --> 00:16:23,008
Any idea who wants you dead?

308
00:16:23,076 --> 00:16:25,478
- Now you want to know?
- Might be helpful.

309
00:16:25,545 --> 00:16:29,481
People in your line of work,
maybe people you know.

310
00:16:29,549 --> 00:16:32,685
I don't know people
like that.

311
00:16:32,752 --> 00:16:34,153
And I don't work
with people like that.

312
00:16:34,220 --> 00:16:36,588
You keep saying
you're not a spy,

313
00:16:36,656 --> 00:16:39,724
and yet consider
the circumstances.

314
00:16:39,792 --> 00:16:41,793
I admit to making
certain parties unhappy.

315
00:16:41,861 --> 00:16:44,095
It's the nature of my work.

316
00:16:44,163 --> 00:16:45,930
The only thing we have
in common--

317
00:16:45,998 --> 00:16:48,300
I'm not the one
with an assassin after him.

318
00:16:48,367 --> 00:16:51,270
The free press has its enemies
in your country and mine.

319
00:16:51,338 --> 00:16:52,872
I'll give you
one thing, Carlo.

320
00:16:52,940 --> 00:16:54,808
Whatever you are,
you talk a good game.

321
00:16:54,875 --> 00:16:57,044
I'll give you that.

322
00:16:59,614 --> 00:17:00,982
Alternator belt.

323
00:17:01,050 --> 00:17:03,251
It's not pretty,
but it'll hold.

324
00:17:03,318 --> 00:17:07,221
Another thing I'm not--
mechanical.

325
00:17:07,289 --> 00:17:08,823
If I found you a macchiato,

326
00:17:08,890 --> 00:17:10,391
you think
that might jog your memory

327
00:17:10,459 --> 00:17:12,793
about who's after us?

328
00:17:15,163 --> 00:17:16,663
Maybe.

329
00:17:20,234 --> 00:17:22,502
But no caramel
or whipped cream.

330
00:17:22,569 --> 00:17:26,705
It's coffee.
It's not an apple pie.

331
00:17:53,335 --> 00:17:54,735
Look, Internet--

332
00:17:54,803 --> 00:17:56,237
I could check my blog.

333
00:17:56,304 --> 00:17:58,272
Classic.

334
00:17:58,339 --> 00:18:00,107
Perfect journo cover.

335
00:18:00,175 --> 00:18:02,609
We both know
there's nothing on your blog.

336
00:18:02,677 --> 00:18:03,910
No?
Let's go.

337
00:18:03,978 --> 00:18:06,046
I'll show you
what I've dedicated my life to,

338
00:18:06,113 --> 00:18:08,882
why people follow my work,
even Americans.

339
00:18:08,950 --> 00:18:10,550
How many people
in Argentina do you think

340
00:18:10,618 --> 00:18:12,285
are logged on to your blog
right now?

341
00:18:12,353 --> 00:18:15,223
My guess is only you.

342
00:18:15,290 --> 00:18:18,125
I happen to have
a, uh, devoted following

343
00:18:18,193 --> 00:18:20,428
in Tierra del Fuego.

344
00:18:20,495 --> 00:18:22,129
Whosever after us
will be watching it.

345
00:18:22,197 --> 00:18:23,598
As soon as you log on,
they'd have us.

346
00:18:23,665 --> 00:18:24,799
So...

347
00:18:24,867 --> 00:18:26,701
No.

348
00:18:26,769 --> 00:18:29,604
And as far as the Argentinean
authorities are concerned,

349
00:18:29,671 --> 00:18:32,874
you and I are both spies.

350
00:18:32,941 --> 00:18:35,142
They find us,
we go to jail.

351
00:18:35,210 --> 00:18:37,078
Jail doesn't scare me.

352
00:18:37,145 --> 00:18:40,948
It's a censored press
that scares me.

353
00:18:41,016 --> 00:18:43,584
Come on.

354
00:18:43,652 --> 00:18:46,053
Treat time.

355
00:18:54,194 --> 00:18:56,062
<i>Gracias.</i>

356
00:18:59,233 --> 00:19:01,367
Ooh!
Milanesa!

357
00:19:01,435 --> 00:19:05,205
Eggs, crumbs, little rub,
quick fry.

358
00:19:05,272 --> 00:19:07,140
Oh!

359
00:19:07,208 --> 00:19:09,410
Oh, ho-ho!
Mm-hmm.

360
00:19:09,477 --> 00:19:12,647
Argentine beef--
the second-best in the world.

361
00:19:12,714 --> 00:19:15,516
It's one of the reasons
I love Argentina.

362
00:19:15,583 --> 00:19:17,451
Frankly,
I prefer <i>parrillada.</i>

363
00:19:17,519 --> 00:19:21,423
Oh, <i>parrillada.</i>
<i>Bene.</i>

364
00:19:21,490 --> 00:19:22,824
Macchiato.

365
00:19:26,928 --> 00:19:28,596
Marked.

366
00:19:30,032 --> 00:19:31,098
I know the saucer's
not heated,

367
00:19:31,166 --> 00:19:34,535
but when in Argentina...

368
00:19:34,602 --> 00:19:37,771
You like me.

369
00:19:37,839 --> 00:19:39,606
I can tell.

370
00:19:41,108 --> 00:19:44,210
No, we have what
we Romans call <i>"simpatia."</i>

371
00:19:44,278 --> 00:19:45,611
You feel it, too, yes?

372
00:19:47,147 --> 00:19:48,848
It's the common space,

373
00:19:48,916 --> 00:19:52,686
the mortar between the bricks,
the words between the words--

374
00:19:52,754 --> 00:19:55,423
courage...

375
00:19:55,491 --> 00:19:59,561
Passion, principles.

376
00:19:59,629 --> 00:20:02,198
<i>Simpatia.</i>

377
00:20:02,266 --> 00:20:06,135
This is...
maybe you and me.

378
00:20:08,606 --> 00:20:11,841
You are either
the best operative

379
00:20:11,909 --> 00:20:15,145
I have ever seen
or the absolute worst.

380
00:20:15,213 --> 00:20:18,381
I can't make up my mind.

381
00:20:18,449 --> 00:20:21,518
I couldn't do what you do.

382
00:20:21,586 --> 00:20:25,089
I trust people.
They trust me.

383
00:20:25,157 --> 00:20:28,192
It's how I do my job.
Me too.

384
00:20:30,096 --> 00:20:32,331
People trust me.

385
00:20:32,398 --> 00:20:34,600
Lots of people trust me,
in fact.

386
00:20:34,668 --> 00:20:37,170
And what does the CIA
ask you to do with this "trust"?

387
00:20:37,237 --> 00:20:39,272
Today they're having me
protect and deliver

388
00:20:39,340 --> 00:20:40,874
a foreign operative.

389
00:20:40,942 --> 00:20:43,410
You know what?

390
00:20:43,478 --> 00:20:46,180
Treat time's over.
Let's go.

391
00:20:46,248 --> 00:20:49,149
You know what, Carlo?
You have us wrong.

392
00:20:49,217 --> 00:20:50,217
Uh-huh.

393
00:20:50,285 --> 00:20:52,052
You got me wrong.

394
00:20:55,589 --> 00:20:58,924
I need to, um, use the...

395
00:20:58,992 --> 00:21:00,993
without assistance.

396
00:21:01,061 --> 00:21:02,294
Oh, no.

397
00:21:02,362 --> 00:21:04,429
I-I promise
on my mother's grave,

398
00:21:04,497 --> 00:21:06,398
I will not run away.

399
00:21:37,599 --> 00:21:39,766
Ah!
<i>Scusa.</i>

400
00:21:39,834 --> 00:21:41,367
<i>Scusa.</i>
<i>Grazie.</i>

401
00:21:50,277 --> 00:21:53,013
Your mom's not really dead,
is she?

402
00:22:30,552 --> 00:22:32,787
<i>Policia federal.</i>

403
00:22:32,855 --> 00:22:34,255
That's a good thing, yes?

404
00:22:34,323 --> 00:22:36,491
That's not a good thing.

405
00:22:36,559 --> 00:22:38,293
What are they doing here?

406
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:39,761
Hmm, it's Argentina.

407
00:22:39,828 --> 00:22:42,497
They're probably--

408
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:47,703
Get down!

409
00:22:47,770 --> 00:22:50,039
What are you doing?

410
00:22:50,107 --> 00:22:51,741
Carlo, I need you
to be quiet right now.

411
00:22:55,579 --> 00:22:56,513
Grab something.

412
00:22:56,580 --> 00:22:57,547
What?

413
00:23:44,034 --> 00:23:45,635
And this is where
I'm not supposed to argue?

414
00:23:45,703 --> 00:23:49,105
Do you see him?

415
00:23:49,172 --> 00:23:51,374
No.
Maybe <i>policia</i> got him.

416
00:23:51,441 --> 00:23:53,042
Oh, I doubt it.

417
00:23:53,109 --> 00:23:55,344
How did he find us?

418
00:23:55,412 --> 00:23:56,845
I don't know.

419
00:24:11,028 --> 00:24:13,830
Here you go.

420
00:24:13,898 --> 00:24:15,565
I'm very worried, Romano.

421
00:24:15,633 --> 00:24:16,967
I'm exposed here.

422
00:24:17,035 --> 00:24:18,536
Joan, of course,
you know I'm sympathetic.

423
00:24:18,603 --> 00:24:19,804
This piece of cake
we planned

424
00:24:19,871 --> 00:24:21,338
has turned
into a disaster for me.

425
00:24:21,406 --> 00:24:24,542
Keeping this on the sly
has been a total mistake.

426
00:24:24,610 --> 00:24:25,976
I can't do it anymore.

427
00:24:26,044 --> 00:24:27,678
I have to go vertical
with this, Romano.

428
00:24:27,746 --> 00:24:29,746
What? Let's not lose
our heads, dear.

429
00:24:29,814 --> 00:24:32,815
I don't know.
I'm very confused.

430
00:24:32,883 --> 00:24:34,884
I need to tell my boss.

431
00:24:34,952 --> 00:24:36,485
I need to tell
the State Department.

432
00:24:36,553 --> 00:24:40,422
I have to read them in on this,
or it will be my ass...

433
00:24:40,490 --> 00:24:43,558
In a very nasty
and very permanent way.

434
00:24:43,626 --> 00:24:45,193
Joan, listen to me.

435
00:24:45,261 --> 00:24:47,563
I won't let you go down.

436
00:24:47,631 --> 00:24:49,799
I promise.

437
00:24:49,867 --> 00:24:52,302
We are all on the hook here,
dear, not just you.

438
00:24:52,369 --> 00:24:56,473
We are in this together.
I don't know about that.

439
00:24:56,541 --> 00:24:59,110
Okay, look,
I understand your concern.

440
00:24:59,177 --> 00:25:01,779
Just give me a few hours.

441
00:25:01,847 --> 00:25:06,485
It's all going to work out.

442
00:25:06,552 --> 00:25:10,355
I guess,
if you think it'll work.

443
00:25:10,423 --> 00:25:12,123
Good.

444
00:25:13,759 --> 00:25:15,960
Good.

445
00:25:19,230 --> 00:25:22,799
Genaro fell for it.
He's dirty.

446
00:25:22,867 --> 00:25:24,868
We're being played.
I'm sure of it.

447
00:25:24,935 --> 00:25:26,402
Pleading,
"We're in this together"?

448
00:25:26,470 --> 00:25:27,838
Right.

449
00:25:27,905 --> 00:25:29,907
Actually,
there was a problem.

450
00:25:29,975 --> 00:25:32,176
Annie busted through
a police barricade.

451
00:25:32,244 --> 00:25:33,745
There's a countrywide A.P.B.
out on her.

452
00:25:33,813 --> 00:25:34,980
What do you want me to do?

453
00:25:35,048 --> 00:25:37,015
Change directives.

454
00:25:37,083 --> 00:25:39,786
Let's move on an extraction.

455
00:25:50,331 --> 00:25:53,901
Take your clothes off.

456
00:25:53,969 --> 00:25:56,070
Uh, pardon me?

457
00:25:56,138 --> 00:25:58,339
There's no way that hitter
could have known where we were.

458
00:25:58,407 --> 00:25:59,407
Take 'em off.

459
00:25:59,475 --> 00:26:01,043
Um...

460
00:26:01,111 --> 00:26:02,444
For heaven sakes.

461
00:26:02,512 --> 00:26:03,778
I'll step outside.

462
00:26:03,846 --> 00:26:07,782
No, that--ah.

463
00:26:07,850 --> 00:26:10,752
When you were in custody,
did anyone come to visit you?

464
00:26:10,820 --> 00:26:12,421
Uh, yes.

465
00:26:12,488 --> 00:26:14,422
One person from the embassy.
So what?

466
00:26:14,490 --> 00:26:16,525
Who?

467
00:26:16,593 --> 00:26:18,327
He didn't say his name.

468
00:26:18,394 --> 00:26:20,528
Did anyone else have access

469
00:26:20,596 --> 00:26:25,133
to where you were
or your things?

470
00:26:25,201 --> 00:26:27,134
No.

471
00:26:28,771 --> 00:26:31,740
You didn't check
your clothes.

472
00:26:31,807 --> 00:26:33,909
No.
Why would I?

473
00:26:35,845 --> 00:26:38,046
That's how the hitter
found us.

474
00:26:38,114 --> 00:26:42,083
He must have planted it
on you when you met.

475
00:26:42,151 --> 00:26:45,153
Get dressed.
We're on foot from here.

476
00:26:45,221 --> 00:26:48,222
Are you kidding?

477
00:26:48,290 --> 00:26:50,257
"Get dressed. Take it off.

478
00:26:50,325 --> 00:26:54,028
Run. Come here.
Stop. Go there."

479
00:27:02,071 --> 00:27:04,071
Again?

480
00:27:04,139 --> 00:27:05,239
It's for your own good.

481
00:27:05,307 --> 00:27:07,775
Yeah, sure.
Whatever.

482
00:27:07,843 --> 00:27:10,211
You know, I bet you never had
an Italian boyfriend.

483
00:27:10,278 --> 00:27:12,746
Oh, which would change
my life forever, no doubt.

484
00:27:12,814 --> 00:27:15,415
You joke, but you ask
any woman, she'll tell you.

485
00:27:15,483 --> 00:27:16,716
We know things.

486
00:27:16,784 --> 00:27:18,618
You, however--
you're a lost cause.

487
00:27:18,686 --> 00:27:20,353
- Are you really this person?
- Eh.

488
00:27:20,421 --> 00:27:22,154
I'm trying to keep us alive,

489
00:27:22,222 --> 00:27:23,622
and you're interested
in my boyfriends?

490
00:27:23,690 --> 00:27:25,157
Well, I'm trying
to help your love life--

491
00:27:25,225 --> 00:27:26,492
You want to help me?

492
00:27:26,559 --> 00:27:29,360
Tell me who's trying
to kill you.

493
00:27:30,496 --> 00:27:31,863
Well--

494
00:27:31,931 --> 00:27:33,298
Unless a woman
shouldn't know these things.

495
00:27:33,366 --> 00:27:34,866
Look, I mean--

496
00:27:34,934 --> 00:27:38,837
I think it's about a story
I've been working on...

497
00:27:38,905 --> 00:27:40,339
about the O.C.U.

498
00:27:40,406 --> 00:27:41,640
The Italian
oil conglomerate?

499
00:27:41,708 --> 00:27:43,275
Yes, exactly,
and the Italian government.

500
00:27:43,343 --> 00:27:44,777
It's a conspiracy?

501
00:27:44,845 --> 00:27:47,380
My sources are connected
to certain government officials.

502
00:27:47,448 --> 00:27:50,216
It's about the oil rigs
here in South America.

503
00:27:50,284 --> 00:27:52,252
I want to get you
to a safe house.

504
00:27:59,728 --> 00:28:01,062
They say,
"Follow the money."

505
00:28:01,130 --> 00:28:05,600
Well, I followed the money,
and here I am.

506
00:28:05,668 --> 00:28:07,669
They know I'm close
to publishing.

507
00:28:07,737 --> 00:28:09,137
I have corroboration--

508
00:28:09,205 --> 00:28:10,805
how they bribed
and extorted

509
00:28:10,873 --> 00:28:12,773
to get their share
of the San Jorge oil fields.

510
00:28:12,841 --> 00:28:16,043
They want to stop me.
They need to stop me.

511
00:28:16,111 --> 00:28:18,145
I am not a spy.

512
00:28:18,212 --> 00:28:19,679
I'm a writer.

513
00:28:19,747 --> 00:28:21,581
I've been working
on this story for two years.

514
00:28:21,649 --> 00:28:23,917
Someone wants me
back in Italy to--

515
00:28:23,985 --> 00:28:26,820
to stop me from publishing.

516
00:28:26,888 --> 00:28:29,023
The Italian embassy
may not be the place to go.

517
00:28:29,091 --> 00:28:30,424
Finally.

518
00:28:30,492 --> 00:28:31,926
But we can't go
to the U.S. embassy either.

519
00:28:31,994 --> 00:28:33,328
- Why?
- It's complicated.

520
00:28:36,065 --> 00:28:37,733
Yeah?
Where are you?

521
00:28:37,801 --> 00:28:39,435
- We're in the city.
- You are not safe.

522
00:28:39,502 --> 00:28:41,270
The local authorities
have your descriptions.

523
00:28:41,338 --> 00:28:42,572
Not surprising.

524
00:28:42,639 --> 00:28:44,340
We're working
on an extraction.

525
00:28:44,408 --> 00:28:46,375
You are not to go
to the Italian embassy.

526
00:28:46,443 --> 00:28:47,677
Understood?
Yeah.

527
00:28:47,745 --> 00:28:49,178
I-I already figured that out.

528
00:28:49,246 --> 00:28:51,013
Are either of you injured?

529
00:28:51,081 --> 00:28:52,549
No, we're good.

530
00:28:52,616 --> 00:28:55,451
The package may not be
what we thought it was.

531
00:28:55,519 --> 00:28:57,787
Well, I don't think anyone
is who we think they are.

532
00:28:57,855 --> 00:29:00,222
Either way, your safety
is what's important.

533
00:29:00,290 --> 00:29:01,824
Auggie's working
on a possible exit.

534
00:29:01,892 --> 00:29:03,493
"Possible"?

535
00:29:03,560 --> 00:29:05,995
Highly probable, though still
in the formative stages.

536
00:29:06,062 --> 00:29:07,396
I need you to get

537
00:29:07,464 --> 00:29:10,032
to the U.S. President's
Line terminal at the wharf.

538
00:29:10,100 --> 00:29:11,801
U.S. President's line

539
00:29:11,868 --> 00:29:13,402
at Buenos Aires
or La Cotta?

540
00:29:13,470 --> 00:29:15,304
Buenos Aires, berth 28.

541
00:29:15,372 --> 00:29:17,206
I'll have more information
when you get there.

542
00:29:17,273 --> 00:29:19,008
Just get there and be safe.

543
00:29:19,076 --> 00:29:21,277
And there's another detail
you need to be aware of.

544
00:29:21,345 --> 00:29:22,712
Annie, we've discovered

545
00:29:22,780 --> 00:29:24,313
that two of Carlo's contacts
have turned up dead

546
00:29:24,381 --> 00:29:25,648
in the past 24 hours.

547
00:29:25,716 --> 00:29:27,616
Both were employed by O.C.U.

548
00:29:27,684 --> 00:29:29,585
He told me he's working
on a story about O.C.U.

549
00:29:29,653 --> 00:29:32,621
Their names are Rinaldo
and Vasquez.

550
00:29:32,689 --> 00:29:34,723
Keep your head down.
Get to the wharf.

551
00:29:34,791 --> 00:29:37,526
We'll get you out.

552
00:29:37,593 --> 00:29:39,995
What?

553
00:29:40,062 --> 00:29:42,197
Rinaldo and Vasquez--
does that mean anything?

554
00:29:42,264 --> 00:29:44,199
Two of my sources.
Why?

555
00:29:44,266 --> 00:29:46,901
They're dead.

556
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:52,707
We have to get to the wharf.

557
00:29:52,775 --> 00:29:54,609
My agency's gonna try
and get us out of here.

558
00:29:54,677 --> 00:29:57,545
But, but--

559
00:29:57,613 --> 00:29:59,580
Carlo.

560
00:29:59,648 --> 00:30:01,850
Carlo, I'm sorry.

561
00:30:01,917 --> 00:30:03,919
I know this is hard,
but we have to move.

562
00:30:03,987 --> 00:30:05,554
I'm responsible.

563
00:30:05,621 --> 00:30:07,456
They put their faith in me,
and now they're dead.

564
00:30:07,523 --> 00:30:09,191
The police
are looking for us.

565
00:30:09,258 --> 00:30:12,928
It'll all be for nothing if you
get caught and go to jail.

566
00:30:12,995 --> 00:30:15,497
We have to move, now.

567
00:30:19,503 --> 00:30:21,170
Uh, oh...

568
00:30:41,692 --> 00:30:43,793
Sorry.

569
00:31:21,637 --> 00:31:23,104
I need to talk
to the editor, please.

570
00:31:23,172 --> 00:31:25,507
<i>Claro que si.</i>

571
00:31:29,012 --> 00:31:30,680
Annie, how--
how did you know?

572
00:31:30,747 --> 00:31:32,348
Where else would
a writer go?

573
00:31:32,416 --> 00:31:33,716
A writer?

574
00:31:33,784 --> 00:31:35,551
Look, we are still
in danger,

575
00:31:35,619 --> 00:31:37,520
and I am still responsible
for you.

576
00:31:37,588 --> 00:31:40,056
- When did you decide that--
- We don't have time for this.

577
00:31:40,123 --> 00:31:41,524
We need to get
to the extraction point.

578
00:31:41,591 --> 00:31:44,359
I am glad. I really am,
but I have to do this.

579
00:31:44,427 --> 00:31:46,028
No, you need to trust me.

580
00:31:46,095 --> 00:31:48,996
I do trust you...
Mostly.

581
00:31:49,064 --> 00:31:51,232
But I trust this too.

582
00:31:51,300 --> 00:31:54,101
Look, if I'm going
to get killed, Annie,

583
00:31:54,169 --> 00:31:56,570
which at this point
is fairly probable,

584
00:31:56,638 --> 00:31:59,407
then I have
to get my story out.

585
00:31:59,475 --> 00:32:00,808
I have to.

586
00:32:00,876 --> 00:32:04,078
I made promises, and I want
to keep those promises.

587
00:32:07,316 --> 00:32:08,983
How do you know
they'll print it?

588
00:32:09,051 --> 00:32:11,553
I don't.

589
00:32:11,620 --> 00:32:14,288
But it's not
the battles won, Annie.

590
00:32:14,356 --> 00:32:15,556
It's the battles waged.

591
00:32:15,624 --> 00:32:18,659
You can understand that...

592
00:32:18,727 --> 00:32:21,395
If you are
who I think you are.

593
00:32:24,399 --> 00:32:26,667
Make it quick.

594
00:32:43,451 --> 00:32:46,554
You think I have
an ulterior motive?

595
00:32:46,622 --> 00:32:49,424
Frankly, yes.

596
00:32:49,492 --> 00:32:50,759
We all have motives.

597
00:32:50,827 --> 00:32:53,062
We're told that in our training,
to expect it.

598
00:32:53,129 --> 00:32:55,365
You think mine are suspect
due to my circumstances?

599
00:32:55,432 --> 00:32:58,468
No, sir.
Due to my circumstances.

600
00:32:58,536 --> 00:32:59,869
Uh-huh.

601
00:32:59,937 --> 00:33:01,571
You're
in a public relations battle,

602
00:33:01,639 --> 00:33:03,540
and I'm the feel-good hit
of the summer.

603
00:33:03,607 --> 00:33:05,008
That's ballsy, Auggie.

604
00:33:05,075 --> 00:33:06,443
Good for you.

605
00:33:06,510 --> 00:33:08,779
I have my reasons, sure.

606
00:33:08,847 --> 00:33:10,780
And, yes, I am fighting
for my career.

607
00:33:10,848 --> 00:33:13,417
So what?
It's irrelevant.

608
00:33:13,484 --> 00:33:16,086
There's never a clean
game board, Auggie, never.

609
00:33:16,153 --> 00:33:18,221
Gets more complicated
the higher you climb.

610
00:33:18,289 --> 00:33:20,524
Up or down, yes or no.

611
00:33:20,591 --> 00:33:22,459
Your decision, your terms.

612
00:33:22,527 --> 00:33:26,030
To hell with me
or what I may or may not need.

613
00:33:26,098 --> 00:33:29,233
And I wouldn't worry about me
too much if I were you.

614
00:33:29,300 --> 00:33:33,604
I still have a few teeth
in my head.

615
00:33:33,671 --> 00:33:35,739
Question--

616
00:33:35,807 --> 00:33:38,041
who would I answer to?

617
00:33:38,109 --> 00:33:40,176
The D.C.I. and me.

618
00:33:40,244 --> 00:33:43,479
And what about...Perks?

619
00:33:43,547 --> 00:33:45,881
What do you have in mind?

620
00:33:45,948 --> 00:33:48,550
Say I wanted an extraction
in a foreign country.

621
00:33:50,319 --> 00:33:54,288
I thought you were gonna ask
for a wet bar.

622
00:34:03,333 --> 00:34:05,601
His people are working
on the same story.

623
00:34:05,668 --> 00:34:07,436
He's got a reporter
in the San Jorge Gulf,

624
00:34:07,504 --> 00:34:08,938
and I also got a name.

625
00:34:09,006 --> 00:34:10,707
I know who visited me
when I was in custody.

626
00:34:10,775 --> 00:34:11,975
- Who?
- Genaro.

627
00:34:12,043 --> 00:34:14,511
Romano Genaro.
He's Italian intelligence.

628
00:34:14,579 --> 00:34:16,647
He gets a cut
on any oil extracted--

629
00:34:16,715 --> 00:34:18,282
potentially millions.

630
00:34:18,349 --> 00:34:21,018
I knew I was making someone
in the government unhappy,

631
00:34:21,085 --> 00:34:22,586
someone pulling strings.

632
00:34:22,654 --> 00:34:23,988
I didn't know until now.

633
00:34:24,056 --> 00:34:26,991
He's in for a big surprise.

634
00:34:43,577 --> 00:34:46,346
What's the best way
to the wharf?

635
00:34:50,051 --> 00:34:51,385
Genaro's our man.

636
00:34:51,452 --> 00:34:54,221
He's been assisting the Italian
oil conglomerate O.C.U.

637
00:34:54,289 --> 00:34:56,190
And coercing oil leases.

638
00:34:56,257 --> 00:34:58,692
Carlo Reni's investigations
were about to uncover that

639
00:34:58,760 --> 00:35:00,026
and name names.

640
00:35:00,094 --> 00:35:01,427
That's why Genaro
was so anxious

641
00:35:01,495 --> 00:35:02,896
to keep this off
the official channels.

642
00:35:02,963 --> 00:35:05,231
So much
for professional courtesy.

643
00:35:05,299 --> 00:35:06,766
Reni is not a spy.

644
00:35:06,834 --> 00:35:09,535
But, Joan, this doesn't change
the facts on the ground.

645
00:35:09,603 --> 00:35:11,004
Jorge--

646
00:35:11,072 --> 00:35:12,739
Your operative crashed
through a police checkpoint

647
00:35:12,806 --> 00:35:15,141
and assaulted
a local policeman.

648
00:35:15,209 --> 00:35:16,609
I'm bringing her in.

649
00:35:16,677 --> 00:35:19,879
Do not threaten me.
This is my operative at risk.

650
00:35:19,947 --> 00:35:22,448
And this is the business
we're in, Joan.

651
00:35:22,516 --> 00:35:24,450
You do your job.

652
00:35:24,518 --> 00:35:26,419
I'll do mine.

653
00:35:26,487 --> 00:35:29,422
Jorge, sometime,
somewhere...

654
00:35:29,490 --> 00:35:31,791
We will have future business.

655
00:35:31,859 --> 00:35:34,761
Do not think for a minute
that your harming

656
00:35:34,829 --> 00:35:37,097
one of my people
will not have a deep impact

657
00:35:37,164 --> 00:35:39,700
on our relationship.

658
00:36:17,874 --> 00:36:19,909
Annie,
what's he doing here?

659
00:36:19,976 --> 00:36:22,011
Someone at the newspaper
must have tipped him off.

660
00:36:22,079 --> 00:36:26,849
What?

661
00:36:26,916 --> 00:36:29,151
What?
I'm gonna uncuff you.

662
00:36:29,219 --> 00:36:32,288
Give me your word.
Yeah.

663
00:36:32,355 --> 00:36:34,089
I want you to stay right here,
and I'll be back.

664
00:36:34,157 --> 00:36:36,091
No, wait, wait, wait.
What are you going to do?

665
00:36:36,159 --> 00:36:37,425
Keep you safe.

666
00:36:48,363 --> 00:36:49,697
Your people are not coming.

667
00:36:49,765 --> 00:36:51,266
- They're coming.
- No.

668
00:36:51,333 --> 00:36:52,734
The minute things
became complicated,

669
00:36:52,802 --> 00:36:54,202
you became dispensable.

670
00:36:54,270 --> 00:36:56,704
It's easier to just let us die.
You're wrong.

671
00:36:56,772 --> 00:36:58,807
The people I work for don't
think of me as dispensable,

672
00:36:58,874 --> 00:37:00,575
or you.

673
00:37:06,615 --> 00:37:07,749
They'll be here.

674
00:37:07,816 --> 00:37:10,619
Come on.

675
00:37:44,950 --> 00:37:47,051
- You okay?
- Uh-huh.

676
00:37:53,960 --> 00:37:55,962
That's our ride.

677
00:38:01,369 --> 00:38:03,770
We have a visual on them.

678
00:38:08,576 --> 00:38:10,276
Extraction team has them
in sight.

679
00:38:26,292 --> 00:38:28,727
Local police
are on the scene.

680
00:38:28,795 --> 00:38:30,029
Standing by.

681
00:38:40,439 --> 00:38:42,974
My compliments...

682
00:38:43,042 --> 00:38:45,744
eluding my men,
staying alive.

683
00:38:47,513 --> 00:38:49,548
But this is the end
of the road.

684
00:38:57,859 --> 00:39:00,060
Enough.

685
00:39:00,128 --> 00:39:03,830
Miss, you and Mr. Reni
will leave my country

686
00:39:03,898 --> 00:39:06,466
as quickly as possible.

687
00:39:08,336 --> 00:39:11,671
Tell Joan I look forward
to our next time.

688
00:39:11,739 --> 00:39:13,973
I will.

689
00:39:27,120 --> 00:39:29,989
We're 555,
whole package on board.

690
00:39:30,057 --> 00:39:32,792
Over and out.

691
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,267
Mr. Genaro,
would you care to add anything

692
00:39:41,335 --> 00:39:42,869
to your statement regarding
the attack

693
00:39:42,937 --> 00:39:45,438
on a U.S. operative
in Argentina?

694
00:39:50,010 --> 00:39:52,911
He offered you the job,
didn't he?

695
00:39:52,979 --> 00:39:55,013
Looks like you're his boy now.

696
00:39:58,350 --> 00:39:59,783
Good luck with that.

Well, I'm a good Italian son.

Look, find me

726

We need to talk.

727
00:41:24,936 --> 00:41:27,238
I have some news.

728
00:41:27,306 --> 00:41:29,107
Hope you had a good night.
