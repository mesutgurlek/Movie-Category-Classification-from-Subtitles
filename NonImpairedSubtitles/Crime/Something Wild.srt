Oh, yeah. There's a pool hall up there.
That's your main place.

Excuse me. Excuse me,
can l get my check?

Hey, Charlie, check for
the gentleman in the front.

Hey, you! Hey! Hey!

- Hey, you didn't pay for your lunch.
- What?

37
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:55,035
- You didn't pay your bill, big boy.
- Oh, sure l paid. Didn't l?

00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:57,310
The check's in your pocket.

Oh.

40
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:07,036
You're right.
OK, let me take care of that right now.

41
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:10,152
I'm sorry. I don't know
how this happened. It's just l...

42
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:15,035
It's just... I got a lot of things on my mind,
business things, and l simply forgot.

43
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:17,469
You deliberately walked out
without paying.

44
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:21,719
I did not. Here, come on. Just take
the money and keep the change and...

45
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:23,990
Fine. Maybe you'd like to tell a cop.

46
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:26,475
No! No, no... don't... no, don't.

47
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:33,793
Let me guess.
Sometimes you don't pay for your lunch.

48
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:37,675
Or maybe you steal the occasional
candy bar, or newspaper.

49
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:41,316
You're a closet rebel.

I gotta call the office.

Which way are you goin'?
l'll give you a ride.

53
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:59,317
Well, don't you... don't you
have to go back to work?

54
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:01,672
I don't work there.

55
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:05,994
W-wait, wait, wait. What's all this
business about the, uh... check?

56
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:08,316
Are you coming?

57
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:13,838
uh, well, l, uh... all right.
It's just l gotta go by the bank. And then...

00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:15,712
(honking)

59
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:20,759
- Thank you.
- Wanna die young?

60
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:23,315
I gotta go by the bank,
then down to the office.

61
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:25,476
- I'll drop you off.
- It's downtown.

62
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:27,556
It's on my way.

63
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:36,038
Ready or not, babe?

64
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,549
You think that was pretty funny,
don't you? The way you...

65
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:46,629
The way you had me goin' back there.

66
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:50,556
- It was all right. I'm Lulu.
- Charles. Pleased to meet you.

67
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:55,036
(Charles) Whoa!

68
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:58,994
- (Lulu) Ooh, yikes!
- Whoo! That was...

69
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:01,315
Wait, wait, wait, wait. Where are we goin'?

70
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:03,192
- I know a short cut.
- Oh, good.

71
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:05,675
- (pager bleeps)
- Oh, crap.

72
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:07,756
- Let me see.
- Oh. It's the...

73
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:12,878
Hey, that's... uh, wait.
This is the Holland Tunnel. This is wrong.

74
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,639
- Are you listening to me? Go back.
- Charlie...

75
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:17,512
What are you doing?

76
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:20,632
You're crazy.
You really know that? Oh, God!

77
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:23,558
I gotta go to work.
I got meetings, a million calls...

78
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:27,275
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
Hey, relax, Charlie. Come on.

79
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:29,709
Take the afternoon off.

80
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:32,274
You deserve it. Really.

81
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:37,030
I can't just take the afternoon off.
What, are you n... nuts?

82
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:42,439
All right, look, you turn around when we
get out of the tunnel. Let's just go back.

83
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:44,516
- This isn't funny.
- Want a drink?

84
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:47,991
No, don't! God, don't drink!
Please, this is dangerous.

85
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:50,076
Don't do that. God, don't.

86
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:54,236
Look, if you don't turn around
and take me back,

87
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:57,318
you're gonna make me do something
that l don't wanna do.

88
00:06:57,880 --> 00:06:59,836
I can hardly wait, Charlie.

l got pictures of my kids?

Is that Glenlivet up there?

- It is Glenlivet, isn't it?
- Mm-hm.

124
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:15,231
I gotta have a bottle. I'm sorry to make
you get up there, but it's my favourite.

00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:17,316
- Of course.
- Thank you.

126
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:22,637
The reason that l like Scotch so much
is because my family's Scottish.

127
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:26,273
My mother's mother was an O'Connor.

128
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:28,709
Oh, really? How bloody interesting.

129
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:30,796
That makes me, like, a quarter Scottish.

130
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:34,675
My father's mother, she was a Hawthorne.

131
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:36,876
(clerk) l've just about got it.

132
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:42,200
Little Willy was conceived on our trip
to Scotland a number of years ago...

133
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:46,154
Oh, crap. See if you can get me out
of that five o'clock squash with Graves.

134
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:47,633
Tell him... Lynn?

135
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:49,910
That was the office, for Christ's...

136
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:55,796
Coming?

137
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:02,199
There's a tax act in the works that
would authorise regulations to be written

138
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:05,995
amplifying what is meant
by "substantial reduction".

139
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:08,076
What?

140
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:13,030
Charlie, what do you do for fun
besides steal candy bars? Huh?

141
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:16,072
You were right. I'm a rebel.

142
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:20,832
I am! l just channelled my rebellion into
the mainstream. I'll give you an example.

143
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:23,758
In '81 , l went long-term munis.

144
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:26,474
Everybody said
"Driggs, you're crazy, don't do it."

145
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:28,795
- Munis?
- Municipal bonds. Tax-free.

146
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:31,480
Hell, l was locking in close to 1 5%.

147
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:36,468
I may look straight,
but deep down, l got what it takes.

148
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:38,756
- Do you?
- Whoa!

149
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:46,435
- What's this?
- Getting a room.

150
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:07,755
Something wrong, Charlie?

151
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:12,590
Maybe it's not such a good idea,
getting a room.

152
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:16,838
- Don't you have someplace we could go?
- How about your place?

153
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:20,509
I can just see the neighbours
watching you get out of the car.

154
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:23,115
You have money?

155
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:27,918
I mean, for the room.

00:35:55,560 --> 00:35:58,677
Come on. She's my mama, Charlie.
Give her a kiss.

464
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:02,674
- Bye, Charlie.
- Thank you for the meal. It was...

465
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:04,518
- Bye, Max
- Heads up, Max.

466
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:08,155
- I hope things work out for you, Charlie.
- Good luck to you too!

467
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:10,475
It was wonderful meeting you, Peaches.

468
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:12,556
Here, let me...

469
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:16,156
(Audrey giggles)

470
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:19,636
Come on! Let's go.

471
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:25,679
- You wanna tell me where we're going?
- No.

472
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:29,636
- (Charlie) So long!
- (Peaches) Bye.

473
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:31,637
I love you, Mama.

474
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:33,239
# Ever fallen in love

475
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:34,918
# ln love with someone

476
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:36,598
# Ever fallen in love

477
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:39,678
# ln love with somone
you shouldn't have fallen in love with

478
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:43,990
- Jesus, what's this?
- Get ready, Charlie.

479
00:36:44,520 --> 00:36:46,875
My high school reunion.
God, l'm so nervous.

480
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:48,956
Are you kidding me?

481
00:36:51,320 --> 00:36:54,357
Wait, wait, wait!
Who am l supposed to be?

482
00:36:55,480 --> 00:36:57,436
- Oh!
- OK.

483
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:08,835
Am l supposed to sign in here?

484
00:37:10,080 --> 00:37:12,469
- Audrey Hankel?
- Yeah.

485
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:14,557
Remember me? Donna Penski?

486
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:17,110
- Yeah, sure, Donna. How are you?
- Fine.

487
00:37:17,240 --> 00:37:19,629
Audrey! James. James Williams.

488
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:21,313
James! Hi!

489
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:24,000
How you doin'?
This is my husband Charlie.

490
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:26,668
- Hello, James.
- Pleased to meet you, Charlie.

491
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:29,598
We have a booklet
with the names and addresses

492
00:37:29,720 --> 00:37:32,188
of all the people
who weren't able to make it tonight.

493
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:33,639
Oh, really?

494
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:35,671
Audrey! Smile, please.

495
00:37:37,640 --> 00:37:39,358
Thank you.

496
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:43,519
- I bet you've got kids, don't you?
- Mm-hm. Two, a boy and a girl.

497
00:37:43,640 --> 00:37:45,995
Oh, that's nice.What are their names?

498
00:37:46,680 --> 00:37:48,636
Their names?

499
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,355
- Scott and Leslie.
- Scott and Leslie.

500
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:56,797
# l thought love
was only true in fairy tales

501
00:37:57,600 --> 00:37:59,875
# Meant for someone else and not for me

502
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:03,671
# Love was out to get me

503
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:05,518
# That's the way it seemed

504
00:38:05,640 --> 00:38:08,029
# Disappointments haunted all my dreams

505
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:10,516
# Then l saw her face

506
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:12,631
# Now l'm a believer

507
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:14,557
# Not a trace

508
00:38:14,680 --> 00:38:16,511
# Of doubt in my mind

509
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:18,596
# l'm in love

510
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:21,991
# l'm a believer
l just couldn't leave her if l tried

511
00:38:27,560 --> 00:38:29,357
# What's the use in tryin'?

512
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:31,232
# All you get is pain

513
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:33,476
# When l needed sunshine, l got rain

514
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:36,356
Whooo!

515
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:39,271
# l'm a believer

516
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:41,152
# l'm a believer

517
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:43,111
# l'm a believer

518
00:38:43,240 --> 00:38:45,196
# l'm a believer

519
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:52,836
I want a big Badger yell.

520
00:38:53,120 --> 00:38:55,076
Woo, woo, woo, woo, woo!

521
00:38:55,880 --> 00:38:57,677
That guy's in my office!

522
00:38:57,800 --> 00:39:00,473
I've always been an introverted, shy guy.

523
00:39:01,240 --> 00:39:02,992
Charles Driggs!

524
00:39:03,120 --> 00:39:06,874
Ah! God! No!
uh, uh, uh... Just let me do the talking.

525
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:09,116
- Larry!
- What the hell are you doing here?

526
00:39:09,240 --> 00:39:12,152
I thought you never got out of the office!

527
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:15,875
You remember my wife Peggy?
You met Charles at the Christmas party.

528
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:19,231
Congrats on that promotion.
You really deserve it.

529
00:39:19,360 --> 00:39:23,273
- I knew you'd go right to the top.
- Thanks. That's nice of you to say.

530
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:26,039
I bet you say that to all the new VPs.

531
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:28,833
uh, this is Audrey.
We've known each other for...

532
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:30,029
We're lovers.

533
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:33,391
Only in the sense
that all human beings are... Iovers.

534
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:35,556
Audrey Driggs?

535
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:38,399
I had to take his name for the baby's sake.

536
00:39:38,520 --> 00:39:41,592
- You're having his child?
- I think it's his child.

537
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:45,390
Larry works in accounting,
down the hall from me, right?

538
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:49,035
Is this the guy who would've wondered
why you were using company plastic

539
00:39:49,160 --> 00:39:52,072
yesterday afternoon
in that motel in New Jersey?

540
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:57,238
Hell, Charles, we could've covered that.
Just let me know next time.

541
00:39:58,040 --> 00:39:59,996
See?

542
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:01,673
This is my wife Peggy.

543
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:05,588
We went to school together, Larry.
Remember? lt's our reunion.

544
00:40:05,720 --> 00:40:07,676
- Hello, Audrey.
- Hi.

545
00:40:10,680 --> 00:40:13,592
- Reunions are fun, aren't they?
- (nervous laugh)

546
00:40:13,720 --> 00:40:15,517
Come on, Larry.

547
00:40:15,640 --> 00:40:17,596
Will you excuse us?

548
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:20,869
Driggs, l didn't think you had it in you.

549
00:40:21,240 --> 00:40:23,196
Oh-ho...

550
00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:29,835
- Thank you.
- Charlie!

551
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:32,475
- Charlie, relax.
- Relax?

552
00:40:33,320 --> 00:40:37,598
What were you doing over there?
That guy works in my office.

553
00:40:37,720 --> 00:40:42,919
If he opens his mouth about any of this,
and, believe me, he will, l'm ruined.

554
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:45,076
Charlie, you are vice president.

555
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:50,838
Did you see the look on that guy's face?
He thinks you're a hero.

556
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:04,196
Charlie, what's wrong?

557
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:08,552
I'll tell you what's wrong. Company
plastic. Valid company credit cards.

558
00:41:08,680 --> 00:41:11,433
They were in my wallet.
It was in my jacket. It's gone.

559
00:41:11,560 --> 00:41:15,314
My MCI number, my access card
to get me into my own building!

560
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:19,991
I mean, God knows who's got them!
My Christmas Club voucher... Oh, crap!

561
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:22,959
- If l don't get it back, you know what?
- What?

562
00:41:25,240 --> 00:41:27,196
I'm fucked!

563
00:41:29,360 --> 00:41:31,316
Charlie, l got it.

564
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:34,356
I got your wallet.

565
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:36,312
You got my wallet?

566
00:41:36,440 --> 00:41:39,637
It fell out of your jacket and l picked it up.

567
00:41:42,120 --> 00:41:45,396
- Why didn't you tell me?
- I'm telling you now.

568
00:41:45,880 --> 00:41:48,235
It's in the glove compartment.

569
00:41:50,840 --> 00:41:52,796
Lulu, look. uh...

570
00:41:56,080 --> 00:42:00,232
God, you're a great girl. You got
a few problems, but you're a great girl.

571
00:42:00,360 --> 00:42:04,433
And you're loaded with potential.
But you're too much for me.

572
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:06,994
I can't handle this.

573
00:42:07,120 --> 00:42:11,910
Let me get my wallet and l'll catch a bus
and go back to my boring, very safe life.

574
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:13,832
While l've still got one.

575
00:42:13,960 --> 00:42:18,158
Charlie, l'm sorry. I didn't think
it was that important. I'm sorry.

576
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:21,150
You believe me, don't you?

577
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:23,236
Yeah, yeah, course l do.

578
00:42:24,080 --> 00:42:28,358
Tomorrow you're gonna wake up,
you're still gonna be Charlie Driggs.

579
00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:31,028
And this'll all be over and done with.

580
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,594
So why don't we enjoy it while we can.

581
00:42:35,160 --> 00:42:37,720
And then tomorrow, no more Lulu.

582
00:42:41,120 --> 00:42:43,076
unless you really wanna go.

583
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:45,956
Then go.

584
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:56,675
(sings in Spanish)

585
00:43:20,120 --> 00:43:22,076
# l'll be there

586
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:24,956
# Any time

587
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:27,396
# You need me

588
00:43:27,560 --> 00:43:29,516
# By your side

589
00:43:30,120 --> 00:43:32,918
# To dry away

590
00:43:34,320 --> 00:43:37,949
# Every teardrop that you cry

591
00:43:38,560 --> 00:43:41,791
# And if he ever leaves you blue

592
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:45,272
# Just remember

593
00:43:45,400 --> 00:43:46,958
# l love you

594
00:43:47,080 --> 00:43:49,036
# And l'll be there

595
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:54,072
# Before the next teardrop falls

596
00:43:56,200 --> 00:43:58,156
# And l'll be there

597
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:00,956
# Before the next

598
00:44:01,400 --> 00:44:04,631
# Teardrop falls

599
00:44:07,640 --> 00:44:09,198
(cheering, applause)

600
00:44:09,320 --> 00:44:12,118
The Feelies! The Feelies!
Come on! Thank you!

601
00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:16,320
You want something... from the bar?

602
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:19,635
I sure would love a soda.

603
00:44:20,720 --> 00:44:23,871
I'm gonna get some air.
I'll be outside, over there.

604
00:44:25,840 --> 00:44:27,796
OK?

605
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:47,991
If l could just... Is it possible...?

606
00:44:48,120 --> 00:44:50,111
Got a light?

607
00:44:50,240 --> 00:44:53,357
uh... Well, let me... No, l don't think so.

608
00:44:53,480 --> 00:44:56,358
I'm lrene. I don't believe in name tags.

609
00:44:56,480 --> 00:44:59,233
Oh. Right. Charlie. I, uh...

610
00:44:59,680 --> 00:45:03,468
never had many concrete convictions
about them one way or another.

611
00:45:03,600 --> 00:45:06,637
- You're Audrey's husband, aren't you?
- uh... Yeah.

612
00:45:06,760 --> 00:45:09,718
Yeah? You don't sound too convinced.

613
00:45:09,840 --> 00:45:13,594
I can hardly believe it myself.
We haven't known each other long.

614
00:45:13,720 --> 00:45:17,793
- You don't exactly seem her type.
- Yeah, well, what can l tell you?

615
00:45:18,160 --> 00:45:21,914
Hi, Audrey.
Check out Charlie at the end of the bar.

616
00:45:22,560 --> 00:45:25,996
Dated, married, church wedding,
you know... And, uh...

617
00:45:26,840 --> 00:45:29,479
I had no idea
Charles had such a way with the ladies.

618
00:45:29,600 --> 00:45:30,953
Neither did he.

619
00:45:31,080 --> 00:45:33,548
- I work in the city.
- Doing what?

620
00:45:34,240 --> 00:45:37,869
You seem overly interested
in Audrey and me.

621
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:39,956
We're old friends.

622
00:45:40,320 --> 00:45:41,673
(band starts up)

623
00:45:41,800 --> 00:45:43,756
(applause, cheering)

624
00:45:48,920 --> 00:45:50,876
Can l get a soda? Can l get a soda?

625
00:45:52,520 --> 00:45:54,988
Charlie?
l get up to New York once in a while.

626
00:45:55,120 --> 00:45:57,156
- What?
- I get up to New York once in a while.

627
00:45:57,280 --> 00:45:58,076
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

628
00:45:58,200 --> 00:46:00,077
- Like to have a drink with me?
- What?

629
00:46:00,200 --> 00:46:02,236
Wanna have a drink in New York?

630
00:46:02,360 --> 00:46:06,319
Yeah. No! No. I'm married.
I got... I'm a married man.

631
00:46:07,280 --> 00:46:08,679
Listen...

632
00:46:08,800 --> 00:46:11,758
Enjoy the reunion, all right?
Nice meeting you.

633
00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:42,429
# Fame, makes a man take things over

634
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:46,197
# Fame, lets him loose
and hard to swallow

635
00:46:46,720 --> 00:46:50,349
# Fame, puts you there
where things are hollow

636
00:46:50,840 --> 00:46:52,796
# Fame

637
00:47:28,760 --> 00:47:31,991
# Fame, what you like is in the limo

638
00:47:32,720 --> 00:47:36,076
# Fame, what you get is no tomorrow

639
00:47:36,680 --> 00:47:39,877
# Fame, what you need
you have to borrow

640
00:47:40,280 --> 00:47:42,236
# Fame

641
00:48:25,680 --> 00:48:27,636
(Charlie) Oh, God!

642
00:48:48,880 --> 00:48:50,836
Hi, baby. Surprise!

643
00:48:51,280 --> 00:48:52,838
Hi, Charlie.

644
00:48:52,960 --> 00:48:55,155
- Let's go.
- Why? What's wrong?

645
00:48:55,280 --> 00:48:57,236
Let's just go.

646
00:49:15,040 --> 00:49:17,600
Charles, hey. Are you
gonna be around tomorrow?

647
00:49:17,720 --> 00:49:20,280
uh... we kind of wanna
get an early start back.

648
00:49:20,400 --> 00:49:22,311
- How about brunch?

651
00:49:30,600 --> 00:49:31,953

652
00:49:32,080 --> 00:49:34,913

653
00:49:35,040 --> 00:49:38,237

654
00:49:38,360 --> 00:49:38,997
Hi.

655
00:49:39,120 --> 00:49:41,918
Well, we know old Peg. Don't we, Peg?

656
00:49:42,120 --> 00:49:43,633
Hi, Ray.

657
00:49:44,040 --> 00:49:48,397
- Charles and l work together in New York.
- Really? Ain't that somethin'?

658
00:49:48,520 --> 00:49:51,910
- Slavin' away over the old...
- Here he comes now!

659
00:49:52,040 --> 00:49:54,554
Haven't seen you in a while, Audrey.

660
00:49:54,680 --> 00:49:58,309
- Seems like only yesterday, Ray.
- How time changes things.

661
00:49:58,440 --> 00:50:01,750
- Oh, too true.
- That's what life's all about, huh?

662
00:50:01,880 --> 00:50:04,474
Speaking of changing things,
we have to go.

663
00:50:04,600 --> 00:50:07,512
- See you all in ten years.
- OK.

664
00:50:07,640 --> 00:50:09,790
- Take care, Charlie.
- Nice to meet you.

665
00:50:09,920 --> 00:50:13,833
- Listen, shall we... OK, let's do it.
- (Audrey) Bye, Peg. Bye, Larry.

666
00:50:13,960 --> 00:50:16,474
Boy, there's a guy who landed on his feet.

667
00:50:16,600 --> 00:50:17,715
How's that?

668
00:50:17,840 --> 00:50:22,038
Nine months ago, his wife takes the kids
and runs off with the family dentist.

669
00:50:22,160 --> 00:50:24,879
It's the best thing
that ever happened to him.

670
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:26,956
Yeah, l believe that.

671
00:50:30,240 --> 00:50:31,468
(engine fails)

672
00:50:31,600 --> 00:50:34,194
- Damn it!
- Don't flood it.

673
00:50:37,280 --> 00:50:38,554
Hi, you all!

674
00:50:38,680 --> 00:50:42,992
- How'd you get out here so fast?
- Always keep 'em guessing, Charlie.

675
00:50:43,120 --> 00:50:45,350
I thought we could have a drink together.

676
00:50:45,480 --> 00:50:48,199
The party's over here.
We still got time for a quick one.

677
00:50:48,320 --> 00:50:50,515
Thanks, but no thanks, Ray.

678
00:50:50,640 --> 00:50:52,596
Oh, come on!

679
00:50:53,160 --> 00:50:55,116
It'll be fun.

680
00:50:55,560 --> 00:50:59,314
- You don't mind, do you, Charlie?
- No, it's OK with me. Honey?

681
00:51:00,040 --> 00:51:02,270
Whaddaya say, Audrey? One drink?

682
00:51:02,720 --> 00:51:07,555
You don't want me to tell Charlie
how you spent your free periods, do ya?

683
00:51:08,520 --> 00:51:11,512
- Come on! One drink!
- OK, one drink.

684
00:51:11,640 --> 00:51:14,393
All right! l'll drive, Charlie!

685
00:51:24,400 --> 00:51:26,755
Hey, Charlie, how do you like this baby?

686
00:51:26,880 --> 00:51:28,757
- Oh, God, it's a beauty, Ray.
- Yeah.

687
00:51:28,880 --> 00:51:32,668
- They don't make 'em like this any more.
- Boy, this baby travels.

688
00:51:33,440 --> 00:51:36,238
- What do you drive?
- I, uh... a Ford station wagon.

689
00:51:36,360 --> 00:51:38,316
A station wagon? Oh!

690
00:51:46,920 --> 00:51:49,036
Hey, guys! How ya doin', huh?

691
00:51:49,160 --> 00:51:52,436
- (Ray) Larry, baby!
- We're going for pizza. Wanna come?

692
00:51:52,560 --> 00:51:54,630
- uh... pizza?
- I don't want no pizza.

693
00:51:54,760 --> 00:51:57,558
No, no, we can't. We've made other plans.

694
00:51:57,840 --> 00:52:02,356
Sure. Anyway, see you Monday morning,
Mr Vice President, huh?

695
00:52:02,840 --> 00:52:04,796
OK! See ya!

696
00:52:09,160 --> 00:52:11,116
He'll get in trouble with those guys.

697
00:52:15,360 --> 00:52:19,273
- So you're a vice president, huh?
- Yep. Just got promoted.

698
00:52:20,360 --> 00:52:23,318
Well, we're gonna have to make this
a night to remember.

699
00:52:23,440 --> 00:52:25,954
# Dressed in a white shirt

700
00:52:26,520 --> 00:52:29,273
# With my hair combed straight

701
00:52:29,600 --> 00:52:31,556
# Here in my black shoes...

702
00:52:31,680 --> 00:52:33,113
Hoo!

703
00:52:39,600 --> 00:52:42,194
Irene, why don't you and Charlie
get us some six packs?

704
00:52:42,320 --> 00:52:44,197
- Yeah, come on, lrene.
- Ray!

705
00:52:44,320 --> 00:52:47,790
Where are your manners?
lt's your town. Why don't you go?

706
00:52:49,520 --> 00:52:50,839
I'll go.

707
00:52:50,960 --> 00:52:52,279
Let him go.

708
00:52:52,400 --> 00:52:53,799
I'll go.

709
00:52:55,080 --> 00:52:58,231
- Irene, why don't you go with her?
- I'll go with her.

710
00:53:03,280 --> 00:53:05,236
Ooooh-eee!

711
00:53:06,800 --> 00:53:08,756
Look at that Audrey.

712
00:53:09,120 --> 00:53:11,429
She is a work of art, huh?

713
00:53:11,560 --> 00:53:13,596
Oh, yeah.

714
00:53:13,880 --> 00:53:16,952
- You're a lucky man, Charlie.
- Oh, don't l know it!

715
00:53:17,760 --> 00:53:22,038
- How long have you been married?
- What is it now? A year ago, September.

716
00:53:22,160 --> 00:53:24,276
- Still newlyweds, really.
- Yeah?

717
00:53:24,400 --> 00:53:28,552
- You know...
- That's wonderful. It really is.

718
00:53:29,600 --> 00:53:33,639
- Where you living these days?
- We got a nice place out in Long lsland.

719
00:53:33,760 --> 00:53:36,638
- Yeah? Where?
- Stony Brook.

720
00:53:37,160 --> 00:53:40,277
- I'm fixing a room up for the kids...
- You got kids?

721
00:53:40,400 --> 00:53:43,949
- Well, we intend to have them.
- Yeah? That's great.

722
00:53:46,920 --> 00:53:51,436
- Audrey was a little wild in high school.
- Oh, well, yes, l can believe that!

723
00:53:51,560 --> 00:53:53,869
But l knew
she'd get herself together one day.

724
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:55,991
Oh... Thank you, Ray.

725
00:53:56,320 --> 00:53:58,709
Irene, how long has he been in town?

726
00:53:58,840 --> 00:54:01,070
- I don't know.
- When did he get out?

727
00:54:01,200 --> 00:54:02,474
I don't know!

728
00:54:02,600 --> 00:54:05,239
- Come on, lrene!
- I swear to God, l don't know.

729
00:54:05,360 --> 00:54:08,511
I was just as surprised as you were
when he showed up.

730
00:54:08,640 --> 00:54:10,596
Oh, God.

731
00:54:11,040 --> 00:54:13,474
I wonder what they're talking about.

732
00:54:13,600 --> 00:54:15,795
Now there's a question.

733
00:54:19,160 --> 00:54:22,391
- I shouldn't be asking you this...
- No, no, no. Anything.

734
00:54:22,520 --> 00:54:23,589
Yeah?

735
00:54:23,720 --> 00:54:26,518
Audrey was the hottest thing in school.

736
00:54:28,040 --> 00:54:31,350
And l was wondering,
what is she really like?

737
00:54:34,440 --> 00:54:36,476
What a gal, Ray. I mean, what a gal!

738
00:54:36,600 --> 00:54:39,672
She is... She's impulsive and...
her imagination...

739
00:54:39,800 --> 00:54:42,678
No, no, no! l mean in bed.

740
00:54:43,640 --> 00:54:45,437
Oh!

741
00:54:45,560 --> 00:54:47,516
What am l doing?

742
00:54:48,080 --> 00:54:51,709
Oh, God! uh... well, she's, uh...

743
00:54:51,960 --> 00:54:56,636
Come on, Charlie, you gotta admit she
looks like she could fuck you right in half.

744
00:54:56,760 --> 00:55:01,993
- I mean, just fuck you to pieces.
- Ray, there's no call for that kind of talk.

745
00:55:06,600 --> 00:55:08,556
You're right.

746
00:55:08,960 --> 00:55:10,916
You're right.

747
00:55:11,600 --> 00:55:13,352
I understand.

748
00:55:14,640 --> 00:55:16,596
Sorry, Charlie.

749
00:55:16,720 --> 00:55:18,392
No...

750
00:55:18,520 --> 00:55:20,476
Sorry, Charlie.

751
00:55:21,960 --> 00:55:23,757
Come on...

752
00:55:24,600 --> 00:55:26,511
We friends?

753
00:55:26,640 --> 00:55:28,596
Sure. Oh, yeah.

754
00:55:29,160 --> 00:55:30,991
OK.

755
00:55:31,120 --> 00:55:34,192
I'm gonna go get me some smokes.
I'll be right back.

756
00:55:36,360 --> 00:55:39,750
You're a good guy, Charlie.
I don't care what they say.

757
00:55:47,240 --> 00:55:49,435
Irene, Charlie's lonely out there.

758
00:55:50,920 --> 00:55:53,639
Why don't you give us
a coupla minutes alone?

759
00:55:54,880 --> 00:55:56,996
Go on! Go keep him company.

760
00:55:57,120 --> 00:55:59,839
- I got nothing to say to you, Ray.
- Come here!

761
00:56:03,640 --> 00:56:06,154
I was hoping you'd show up tonight.

762
00:56:06,880 --> 00:56:09,872
- When'd you get out?
- I've been lookin' for you.

763
00:56:10,400 --> 00:56:12,197
How did you get out, Ray?

764
00:56:12,320 --> 00:56:15,278
- Who's this Charlie guy?
- He's nobody. I just met him.

765
00:56:15,400 --> 00:56:19,951
Oh, yeah? He's out there braggin'
about what a great piece of ass you are.

766
00:56:20,080 --> 00:56:21,991
Bullshit, Ray. You're sick.

767
00:56:22,120 --> 00:56:24,509
He's too nice
to say something like that.

768
00:56:24,640 --> 00:56:25,675
Audrey!

769
00:56:27,080 --> 00:56:29,389
I missed you so goddamn much!

770
00:56:31,200 --> 00:56:33,839
- Every sweet little part of you.
- Don't...

771
00:56:34,920 --> 00:56:37,229
You should've never quit me, baby.

772
00:56:37,360 --> 00:56:40,477
I tried to explain to you
in the last letter l wrote you.

773
00:56:40,600 --> 00:56:44,673
Write me?! Fuck, Audrey! l'm up
for a nickel and all you can do is write?!

774
00:56:44,800 --> 00:56:46,995
I don't wanna talk about it, Ray.

775
00:56:47,120 --> 00:56:51,796
I said l'd have one drink with you.
But it's over. Remember that, OK?

776
00:56:57,560 --> 00:57:00,677
Are you saying
that you don't love me any more?

777
00:57:02,160 --> 00:57:04,116
Is that what you're saying?

778
00:57:05,600 --> 00:57:08,398
- Yeah, that's what l'm saying.
- Yeah, right.

779
00:57:17,360 --> 00:57:19,999
Hey, Charlie's got a beer.
Where's my beer?

780
00:57:20,120 --> 00:57:24,636
- Right here.
- Aah... Damn! l forgot to get cigarettes.

781
00:57:24,760 --> 00:57:27,149
Can you get me some cigarettes,
please? Please?

782
00:57:27,280 --> 00:57:29,350
Sure. There ya go.

783
00:57:30,280 --> 00:57:32,350
Thanks, lrene. You're all right.

784
00:57:32,480 --> 00:57:34,436
(starts engine)

785
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:37,639
- Hurry up, lrene.
- Oh, yeah.

786
00:57:38,240 --> 00:57:40,151
Charlie, watch this.

787
00:57:40,280 --> 00:57:42,748
(Audrey) Ray, wait! Ray!

788
00:57:42,880 --> 00:57:45,189
- What are you doin', Ray?
- What's it look like?

789
00:57:45,320 --> 00:57:47,754
- Irene!
- Wait, there's lrene!

790
00:57:53,040 --> 00:57:54,996
(Ray) She's a big girl. She'll be OK.

791
00:57:55,120 --> 00:58:00,240
Besides, this is your night to celebrate.
I thought l'd make it just the three of us.

792
00:58:00,360 --> 00:58:02,590
Come on, hop up in front. Come on!

793
00:58:02,720 --> 00:58:05,792
- Yeah, well, all right, Ray.
- Come on. There ya go.

794
00:58:06,080 --> 00:58:08,071
- Come on, Audrey.
- No.

795
00:58:08,200 --> 00:58:10,236
Well, looks like it's you and me, pal.

796
00:58:10,360 --> 00:58:12,920
# Goodnight, lrene...

797
00:58:27,200 --> 00:58:29,555
What are we stoppin' for now?

798
00:58:30,920 --> 00:58:33,388
Still gotta get my smokes, remember?

799
00:58:33,520 --> 00:58:36,876
Come on, Charlie.
I wanna show you something.

800
00:58:38,240 --> 00:58:41,471
Oh, boy.
I'm gonna grab some more beverages.

801
00:58:42,360 --> 00:58:44,351
- You want anything?
- Stay here with me.

802
00:58:44,480 --> 00:58:47,870
Audrey, l'll leave the radio on.
You don't think she'd leave us, do you?

803
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:50,230
No. You wouldn't do that, would you?

804
00:58:50,360 --> 00:58:53,989
- Come on. I wanna show you something.
- Great.

805
00:58:54,960 --> 00:58:56,916
Take it easy.

806
00:59:01,160 --> 00:59:02,195
- Charlie?
- Yeah?

807
00:59:02,320 --> 00:59:05,790
- Ever been on TV?
- No, Ray. I've never been on television.

808
00:59:05,920 --> 00:59:07,638
- Here's your chance.
- Why? What?

809
00:59:07,760 --> 00:59:11,469
- You're new vice president, huh?
- I am the new VP. Don't you forget it.

810
00:59:11,600 --> 00:59:13,716
All right. Well, make a speech.

811
00:59:14,200 --> 00:59:16,156
Oh, look at that!

812
00:59:16,560 --> 00:59:18,516
- You're on, slick.
- Yeah.

813
00:59:19,160 --> 00:59:20,673
uh...

814
00:59:20,920 --> 00:59:22,717
Hello! Hey! Hey!

815
00:59:22,840 --> 00:59:24,068
- Hello.
- How are you?

816
00:59:24,200 --> 00:59:26,668
- What can l do for you?
- Let me have a pack of Marlboros.

817
00:59:26,800 --> 00:59:29,075
Marlboros. Will that be all?

818
00:59:29,200 --> 00:59:32,909
(Charlie) ..to Larry Dillman,
a man whose discretion

819
00:59:33,040 --> 00:59:36,589
is exceeded only
by his bad taste in suits.

820
00:59:36,840 --> 00:59:38,717
Thank you. Thank you very much.

821
00:59:38,840 --> 00:59:40,671
Thank you. Sit down!

822
00:59:40,800 --> 00:59:42,995
Please, sit down.

823
00:59:43,400 --> 00:59:44,913
I don't think we got Marlboros.

824
00:59:45,040 --> 00:59:49,830
..thanks to my wonderful wife Audrey,
who has stood by me through...

825
00:59:51,200 --> 00:59:51,837
Wow!

826
00:59:51,960 --> 00:59:53,837
Hey!

827
00:59:53,960 --> 00:59:57,270
Jesus Christ! Ray, what are you...? Oh!

828
00:59:58,400 --> 01:00:00,118
You OK?

829
01:00:02,320 --> 01:00:04,276
Bastard, Ray!

830
01:00:15,600 --> 01:00:17,556
Are you all right, Charlie?

831
01:00:17,680 --> 01:00:18,954
Get up! Get up!

832
01:00:19,800 --> 01:00:21,392
Ray, goddamn you!

833
01:00:21,520 --> 01:00:23,476
Just shut up, Audrey!

834
01:00:52,800 --> 01:00:55,792
I'm gonna tell you something, Charlie.

835
01:00:55,920 --> 01:00:58,434
When l used to do this for a living,

836
01:00:58,560 --> 01:01:01,711
I used to pull a job at some liquor store,

837
01:01:01,840 --> 01:01:05,116
run around the corner,
pull off the ski mask l was wearing,

838
01:01:05,240 --> 01:01:10,234
put on a different coat and walk
right back into the place l just robbed.

839
01:01:10,360 --> 01:01:14,911
Man, it was wild! They'd be so flipped out,
they wouldn't know their own mothers.

840
01:01:15,040 --> 01:01:19,318
I'd be standing there when they described
what happened and who robbed 'em.

841
01:01:19,440 --> 01:01:24,275
Half the time, they thought
it was some spook that did it.

842
01:01:24,400 --> 01:01:26,914
They'll see your face
on the videotape, pal.

843
01:01:27,040 --> 01:01:29,349
It just might be you they get.

844
01:01:57,920 --> 01:01:59,876
Come on! Come on, move it!

845
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:19,357
OK, boys and girls. Let's play
a little game of true confessions.

846
01:02:19,480 --> 01:02:23,075
- Get away from him. Just get away.
- Just checking his nose.

847
01:02:25,360 --> 01:02:28,432
Now l know you two
can't really be married.

848
01:02:28,560 --> 01:02:30,232
I haven't seen you in a while,

849
01:02:30,360 --> 01:02:33,511
but they woulda sent me papers
if you were divorcing me.

850
01:02:34,600 --> 01:02:38,878
So why don't you two lovebirds
just tell me what the fuck is goin' on?

851
01:02:40,960 --> 01:02:42,598
Tell me, goddammit!

852
01:02:42,720 --> 01:02:45,553
- (man) Knock it off in there!
- You knock it the fuck off!

853
01:02:45,680 --> 01:02:48,877
Stop it, Ray! Cut it out! Ray, stop it!

854
01:02:49,520 --> 01:02:51,476
I'll tell you, all right?

855
01:02:52,760 --> 01:02:56,992
He's just a guy. I picked him up
on the street in New York.

856
01:02:58,320 --> 01:03:03,917
We pretended to be married for Mama,
and it just carried over to the reunion.

857
01:03:04,040 --> 01:03:07,396
The guy's got a real wife
and two real children.

858
01:03:07,520 --> 01:03:10,353
- It's just a joke that got outta hand.
- Bullshit!

859
01:03:10,480 --> 01:03:12,232
Bullshit, bullshit, bullshit!

860
01:03:12,360 --> 01:03:16,478
- (man) Shut up in there!
- You shut the fuck up, goddammit!

861
01:03:16,600 --> 01:03:18,955
(furious yelling)

862
01:03:20,520 --> 01:03:22,750
(shouting continues)

863
01:03:31,360 --> 01:03:33,316
(groans)

864
01:03:34,680 --> 01:03:36,636
Ray...

865
01:03:38,520 --> 01:03:42,354
I met him yesterday.
There's nothing going on.

866
01:03:42,480 --> 01:03:44,550
Nothing. OK?

867
01:03:44,680 --> 01:03:48,309
Look at you.
You look like a goddamn TV show.

868
01:03:49,760 --> 01:03:51,591
Just like he does.

869
01:03:51,720 --> 01:03:54,518
# Da-da-da, da-da-da-da-da.

870
01:03:56,400 --> 01:04:00,188
I may not be educated,
like Charlie-boy there,

871
01:04:00,320 --> 01:04:02,276
but l am not stupid.

872
01:04:02,440 --> 01:04:04,476
She's telling you the truth, Ray.

873
01:04:04,800 --> 01:04:06,756
Is she?

874
01:04:08,360 --> 01:04:10,635
Is she telling me the truth, Charlie?

875
01:04:11,320 --> 01:04:12,275
Yes.

876
01:04:12,640 --> 01:04:14,153
Yeah? Here...

877
01:04:14,400 --> 01:04:16,960
Ray, you're making a big deal
out of nothing!

878
01:04:17,080 --> 01:04:20,868
- I'm sorry l lied to you, Charlie!
- You're still lying!

879
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:23,833
I know for a fact
that your friend isn't married.

880
01:04:24,120 --> 01:04:27,351
- His wife left him because of you.
- What? What?!

881
01:04:27,480 --> 01:04:29,072
Are you out of your mind?!

882
01:04:29,200 --> 01:04:31,998
I only met him yesterday!

883
01:04:32,120 --> 01:04:35,237
How many times
do you want me to say it?

884
01:04:41,560 --> 01:04:43,516
Tell me, Charlie,

885
01:04:44,760 --> 01:04:46,318
when did your wife leave you?

886
01:04:46,440 --> 01:04:50,558
I can't imagine where you heard that, Ray.
That's absolutely ridiculous.

887
01:04:50,680 --> 01:04:52,875
- Tell me, Charlie.
- It's not true.

888
01:04:54,320 --> 01:04:56,595
I have a wife. I have a family. I have...

889
01:04:57,000 --> 01:04:58,831
Forget it.

890
01:04:58,960 --> 01:05:01,110
- Charlie...
- Ow! Last September.

891
01:05:03,200 --> 01:05:05,156
Last September?

892
01:05:08,480 --> 01:05:10,675
You're a really good liar, Charlie.

893
01:05:12,360 --> 01:05:14,316
Oooo-eee!

894
01:05:14,800 --> 01:05:16,518
(laughs)

895
01:05:16,640 --> 01:05:20,315
Charlie, this is Audrey.
Audrey, this is Charlie.

896
01:05:22,640 --> 01:05:24,596
Who's shittin' who here?

897
01:05:25,200 --> 01:05:27,156
unbelievable!

898
01:05:33,320 --> 01:05:35,629
Let me ask you a question.

899
01:05:35,760 --> 01:05:38,911
- Did you ever box?
- No.

900
01:05:42,360 --> 01:05:44,476
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

901
01:05:44,600 --> 01:05:46,556
- You sure?
- Yeah.

902
01:05:47,680 --> 01:05:50,672
- Here. Have a shot.
- No. Thank you.

903
01:05:51,080 --> 01:05:53,036
Audrey?

904
01:05:58,880 --> 01:06:01,235
I used to spar around a lot in the joint.

905
01:06:02,360 --> 01:06:05,909
It was just me
and a bunch of the brothers.

906
01:06:06,040 --> 01:06:08,759
They all thought l was crazy.

907
01:06:08,880 --> 01:06:13,396
By the time l got out of there though,
they all had respect for me, Charlie.

908
01:06:15,120 --> 01:06:19,716
Got my nose broke three times
in three years, but... what the hell?

909
01:06:20,400 --> 01:06:22,516
A broken nose ain't gonna kill ya.

910
01:06:22,880 --> 01:06:26,759
No, it won't kill you, Ray,
but violence never solved anything.

911
01:06:26,880 --> 01:06:30,793
What goes around, comes around.
You're gonna learn that some day.

912
01:06:30,920 --> 01:06:33,354
Ray, would you just get him outta here?

913
01:06:33,480 --> 01:06:37,314
Shit, baby, he's gonna have the cops here
before we get around the block.

914
01:06:37,440 --> 01:06:41,752
Why? What is he gonna say?
Nobody forced him to come along.

915
01:06:41,880 --> 01:06:44,758
If he opens his mouth,
he can take his house in the suburbs,

916
01:06:44,880 --> 01:06:47,678
and his lawn and his station wagon,

917
01:06:47,800 --> 01:06:50,917
and his normal life,
and flush it right down the toilet.

918
01:06:51,040 --> 01:06:55,318
unless, of course,
you were lying about that too, Charlie?

919
01:06:55,440 --> 01:06:57,635
No, l'm not lying about that.

920
01:07:02,680 --> 01:07:05,513
Do you understand the situation?

921
01:07:06,920 --> 01:07:08,558
Yeah.

922
01:07:17,640 --> 01:07:21,030
I'm sure you two
will be very happy together.

923
01:07:21,160 --> 01:07:23,116
Get the fuck out.

924
01:07:47,640 --> 01:07:49,596
(panting)

925
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:02,956
(glass breaks)

926
01:08:38,920 --> 01:08:40,876
(chuckles)

927
01:08:42,400 --> 01:08:45,039
Old habits die hard, huh, baby?

928

Hey, anything you want, Charlie.

Excuse me, Joy.

941

You got it. Right here for you.

You oughta really see somebody

959
01:11:31,680 --> 01:11:34,319
A broken nose ain't gonna kill ya, Nelson.

977
01:14:57,160 --> 01:14:59,116
What a dumb shit!

978
01:14:59,480 --> 01:15:01,436

You wanted to swim?
You wanna swim, swim!

994
01:16:10,160 --> 01:16:12,116
Asshole!

995
01:16:23,080 --> 01:16:25,514
They look like a terrible couple.

01:16:28,840 --> 01:16:31,798
- We're closed.

You like it around here?

01:16:56,120 --> 01:16:57,439
It's OK.

1003
01:16:57,560 --> 01:16:59,676
Don't you get kinda bored?

1004
01:17:01,000 --> 01:17:02,956
Yeah, sometimes.

1005
01:17:03,520 --> 01:17:05,476
Sometimes?

1006
01:17:06,560 --> 01:17:08,278
Sometimes what?

1007
01:17:08,400 --> 01:17:11,631
Sometimes it's boring,
or sometimes there's something to do?

1008
01:17:11,760 --> 01:17:13,637
Sometimes it's boring.

1009
01:17:15,240 --> 01:17:17,595
- What's your name?

1013
01:17:59,680 --> 01:18:01,636
OK. Fine. Here we go.

1014
01:18:15,360 --> 01:18:21,435
I'll have a JD burger and some fries.
And some extra pickles.

1015
01:18:22,640 --> 01:18:24,790

1016
01:18:25,320 --> 01:18:26,833
- You got it.

1017
01:18:45,760 --> 01:18:47,876
Hey, fella, you using the telephone?

1018
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:49,956
No, go ahead.

1019
01:18:53,520 --> 01:18:55,476
(dog growls)

1020
01:19:27,640 --> 01:19:30,154
Sit down and relax
and we'll get you some coffee.

1021
01:19:30,280 --> 01:19:32,840
Darlene? Coffee, please, for George.

1022
01:19:35,400 --> 01:19:38,836
- How about dessert?
- Let me have the Rustler's Rhapsody.

1023
01:19:38,960 --> 01:19:42,396
- Rustler's Rhapsody.
- Just a coffee for me, Darlene.

1024
01:19:42,520 --> 01:19:45,876
- In a flash.
- You don't mind, do you, Ray?

1025
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:49,037
You're outta your mind.
You don't know what you're doin'.

1026
01:19:49,160 --> 01:19:50,957
Charlie!

1027
01:19:51,280 --> 01:19:54,192
You are one dumb son of a bitch!

1028
01:19:56,560 --> 01:19:58,994
I'm almost starting to like you, Charlie.

1029
01:19:59,120 --> 01:20:01,076
- Here you go.
- Thanks, Darlene.

1030
01:20:01,600 --> 01:20:03,556
I want Lulu.

1031
01:20:04,840 --> 01:20:08,037
Is that your name this week? Lulu?

1032
01:20:08,560 --> 01:20:09,629
Yes.

1033
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:13,231
You know, Charlie,
she's not gonna be too happy

1034
01:20:13,360 --> 01:20:16,511
driving around in a station wagon
the rest of her life.

1035
01:20:16,640 --> 01:20:18,596
You better think about that.

1036
01:20:19,520 --> 01:20:23,149
You better ask yourself
if you really want her.

1037
01:20:25,320 --> 01:20:26,958
I really want her.

1038
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:28,910
Awww.

1039
01:20:29,040 --> 01:20:30,871
Great.

1040
01:20:31,960 --> 01:20:35,919
Charlie, you gotta fight
for a woman like this.

1041
01:20:36,760 --> 01:20:41,436
I don't have to fight you. We'll waltz outta
here, and there's not a thing you can do.

1042
01:20:41,560 --> 01:20:43,312
(guffaws)

1043
01:20:43,440 --> 01:20:45,078
Grrr!

1044
01:20:46,400 --> 01:20:49,551
Oh, Charlie. You are somethin'.
You are somethin'!

1045
01:20:50,520 --> 01:20:52,670
Take a look over there.

1046
01:20:52,800 --> 01:20:54,677
Go ahead.

1047
01:20:55,320 --> 01:20:57,595
- Evening, officer.
- How's it goin'?

1048
01:21:06,560 --> 01:21:11,270
Ray, you're a convicted felon
in possession of a concealed weapon.

1049
01:21:11,400 --> 01:21:15,393
You robbed a grocery store,
assaulted that poor kid with a gun.

1050
01:21:16,120 --> 01:21:20,511
You left Pennsylvania, which is gonna
come as a surprise to your parole officer.

1051
01:21:20,640 --> 01:21:24,872
And l'd be willing to wager
that Cadillac of yours is hot.

1052
01:21:25,240 --> 01:21:27,196
Charlie...

1053
01:21:36,120 --> 01:21:38,998
Now it's you with something to lose.

1054
01:21:39,120 --> 01:21:40,872
Fuck you.

1055
01:21:41,400 --> 01:21:44,915
- He's got you, Ray.
- Fuck you too, Lulu.

1056
01:21:48,160 --> 01:21:49,673
Evening, officers.

1057
01:21:49,800 --> 01:21:52,360
- How ya doin'?
- Oh, pretty good, thank you.

1058
01:21:54,560 --> 01:21:56,516
Hand over the car keys.

1059
01:21:58,760 --> 01:22:01,320
Come on, hand over the car keys.

1060
01:22:02,360 --> 01:22:04,510
At JD's - where else?

1061
01:22:10,840 --> 01:22:12,796
(rattles car keys)

1062
01:22:14,120 --> 01:22:17,396
- (Lulu) Let's go.
- You're gonna regret this.

1063
01:22:17,520 --> 01:22:19,670
- Well, life's full of regrets.
- No.

1064
01:22:20,440 --> 01:22:23,034
You are really gonna regret this.

1065
01:22:23,720 --> 01:22:26,632
- Now your wallet.
- Charlie, come on!

1066
01:22:33,280 --> 01:22:36,431
You think you're pretty smart,
don't you, Charlie?

1067
01:22:36,960 --> 01:22:38,757
Pretty smart.

1068
01:22:39,000 --> 01:22:42,754
But look, Ray, just to show you
there's no hard feelings,

1069
01:22:44,400 --> 01:22:46,391
this one's on me.

1070
01:22:52,240 --> 01:22:54,754
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight.

1071
01:23:04,080 --> 01:23:06,719
The gentleman said
you'd take care of this.

1072
01:23:16,360 --> 01:23:18,351
That son of a bitch.

1073
01:23:29,880 --> 01:23:31,074
Yow!

1074
01:23:31,200 --> 01:23:32,599
God, that was great!

1075
01:23:32,720 --> 01:23:36,679
Oh, man, that'll teach him
to fool with Charlie Driggs, l'll tell you.

1076
01:23:58,000 --> 01:23:59,797
(Lulu) OK, liar. Get out!

1077
01:24:00,880 --> 01:24:03,997
- What, you jokin'?
- You saved me, l saved you. Now get out!

1078
01:24:04,120 --> 01:24:07,351
- I'm not getting out of the car.
- Get out of the fucking car!

1079
01:24:07,480 --> 01:24:10,472
- I'm in the middle of Virginia!
- Charlie, go!

1080
01:24:10,600 --> 01:24:12,511
- No! l'm not...
- Goddammit! Get out!

1081
01:24:12,640 --> 01:24:16,633
- It's the middle of the night!
- Get out of the fucking car, Charlie!

1082
01:24:17,680 --> 01:24:18,795
OK...

1083
01:24:18,920 --> 01:24:20,876
What are you...?

1084
01:24:21,200 --> 01:24:22,758
Aw...

1085
01:24:35,280 --> 01:24:39,478
You're... Sometimes l don't know
whether you're kiddin' around or not.

1086
01:24:40,440 --> 01:24:43,512
Goddamn you, Charlie!
l saw your wedding ring!

1087
01:24:43,640 --> 01:24:46,029
Shit, l saw the family pictures!

1088
01:24:46,160 --> 01:24:49,550
I get involved with a married man
who's not even married?!

1089
01:24:49,680 --> 01:24:52,433
I was married
when those pictures were taken.

1090
01:24:53,920 --> 01:24:54,989
Very funny.

1091
01:24:55,120 --> 01:24:56,838
(splash)

1092
01:24:58,280 --> 01:25:01,556
I wear the ring because
l hate to admit that my family fell apart.

1093
01:25:01,680 --> 01:25:04,194
I told you l was married to protect myself.

1094
01:25:04,320 --> 01:25:07,153
And then l was afraid that if l told you,
you'd take off.

1095
01:25:07,280 --> 01:25:09,271
You're right, asshole. I would've.

1096
01:25:09,400 --> 01:25:13,393
- You were lying a blue streak to me too.
- Exactly.

1097
01:25:35,920 --> 01:25:37,751
Oh, thank you, Lord!

1098
01:25:37,880 --> 01:25:41,589
(kisses window) Come in, come in.
Come, come, come! Come around!

1099
01:25:41,720 --> 01:25:44,154
Come in! Come in! Come in! Come in!

1100
01:25:52,280 --> 01:25:53,918
OK...

1101
01:25:54,040 --> 01:25:57,237
I'll be back in a couple of days, OK?
You gonna be here?

1102
01:25:57,360 --> 01:25:59,794
Did your sister really run off
with a Bible salesman?

1103
01:25:59,920 --> 01:26:03,071
I swear to God. The religious types
are the worst kind.

1104
01:26:03,200 --> 01:26:05,873
- I'll be back, OK? You'll be here?
- Mm-hm.

1105
01:26:08,560 --> 01:26:10,994
OK, l better get going, all right?

1106
01:26:16,360 --> 01:26:18,430
- Go on, go on. Go home!
- See ya.

1107
01:26:18,560 --> 01:26:20,516
Hurry up. Go on.

1108
01:26:34,000 --> 01:26:35,956
(squeak)

1109
01:26:39,640 --> 01:26:41,596
(engine starts)

1110
01:27:09,840 --> 01:27:12,149
(radio) ..can't do anything but fail.

1111
01:27:12,280 --> 01:27:16,592
Did you see the SOS
Jesus COD'd to you?

1112
01:27:19,560 --> 01:27:21,118
Are you saved?

1113
01:27:21,240 --> 01:27:23,196
Are you good?

1114
01:27:23,480 --> 01:27:25,436
Are you OK?

1115
01:27:26,040 --> 01:27:27,996
It's late.

1116
01:27:28,440 --> 01:27:30,396
Time to go.

1117
01:27:30,520 --> 01:27:35,196
Thanks, Reverend Jim. It's 5 o'clock
right now, a.m., Baltimore time.

1118
01:27:35,320 --> 01:27:37,276
We're comin' at you live.

1119
01:27:52,200 --> 01:27:54,589
(Lulu) lt's so strange.

1120
01:27:55,280 --> 01:27:59,114
- Did you say something?
- I just don't wanna go to my apartment.

1121
01:28:01,320 --> 01:28:03,276
Shit...

1122
01:28:04,160 --> 01:28:05,957
Well,...

1123
01:28:06,080 --> 01:28:08,230
you can stay at my place.

1124
01:28:08,360 --> 01:28:10,078
For tonight.

1125
01:28:10,680 --> 01:28:14,832
There's not much in the way of furniture,
but there's plenty of room.

1126
01:28:15,520 --> 01:28:17,476
OK, thanks.

1127
01:28:30,800 --> 01:28:32,756
Audrey Hankel.

1128
01:28:36,640 --> 01:28:38,596
(glass breaking)

1129
01:28:47,800 --> 01:28:50,758
Yeah, uh... Stony Brook.

1130
01:28:51,920 --> 01:28:53,990
Charles Driggs.

1131
01:28:54,120 --> 01:28:56,680
Yeah, with a D. D-R, yeah.

1132
01:28:56,800 --> 01:28:59,075
Lemme have the address on that.

1133
01:28:59,200 --> 01:29:02,715
1427 Maple. 1427 Maple. Thanks.

1134
01:29:51,800 --> 01:29:55,156
- Where's the bathroom?
- Down the hall, to the left.

1135
01:29:58,480 --> 01:30:00,436
(sighs)

1136
01:30:37,280 --> 01:30:39,236
Charlie...

1137
01:30:44,960 --> 01:30:46,234
Yeah?

1138
01:30:46,360 --> 01:30:51,195
What are you gonna do now you've seen
how the other half lives?

1139
01:30:51,320 --> 01:30:53,276
The other half?

1140
01:30:53,400 --> 01:30:55,356
The other half of you.

1141
01:31:29,960 --> 01:31:31,712
Hiya, Charlie.

1142
01:31:31,960 --> 01:31:32,915
Ray!

1143
01:31:40,920 --> 01:31:42,876
Get up!

1144
01:31:46,560 --> 01:31:49,199
Let's see what you're made of now,
Charlie!

1145
01:31:50,000 --> 01:31:51,956
(Lulu) Charlie?

1146
01:31:53,480 --> 01:31:55,436
Charlie?

1147
01:31:55,880 --> 01:31:57,552
Ray, stop it! You'll kill him!

1148
01:31:57,680 --> 01:31:59,636
I'm just warming up!

1149
01:32:00,560 --> 01:32:02,516
Get out of the way!

1150
01:32:03,240 --> 01:32:04,798
Ow!

1151
01:32:05,920 --> 01:32:09,390
I'm glad to see you finally
made it to the suburbs, bitch!

1152
01:32:12,080 --> 01:32:13,672
Come here!

1153
01:32:13,960 --> 01:32:15,916
(Charlie groans)

1154
01:32:17,600 --> 01:32:19,556
I don't care...

1155
01:32:20,800 --> 01:32:24,429
what she tells you, l know my wife.

1156
01:32:25,040 --> 01:32:28,669
And you white-bread VIP types
just don't do it for her.

1157
01:32:29,240 --> 01:32:32,949
- You all right there, Charlie?
- Charlie, l'm gonna get help!

1158
01:32:37,120 --> 01:32:38,792
Charlie!

1159
01:32:39,320 --> 01:32:42,153
Didn't l tell you to stay?
Haven't you hurt me enough?

1160
01:32:42,280 --> 01:32:44,953
Look what you're doing to me!
Get in here!

1161
01:32:46,000 --> 01:32:48,150
Why are you doing this to me? Shut up!

1162
01:32:49,040 --> 01:32:51,076
(crashing and shouting)

1163
01:32:51,200 --> 01:32:55,239
(Ray) Come on in here, Charlie!
Come on into your bedroom, Charlie!

1164
01:32:55,360 --> 01:32:57,635
(shouting continues)

1165
01:32:57,920 --> 01:32:59,751
Lulu!

1166
01:33:01,040 --> 01:33:03,235
Stop it, Ray! Stop it!

1167
01:33:03,400 --> 01:33:05,038
Charlie, are you OK?

1168
01:33:05,280 --> 01:33:06,998
Charlie!

1169
01:33:07,120 --> 01:33:09,076
(Ray shouting)

1170
01:33:13,120 --> 01:33:15,350
- I hate you!
- I hate you too!

1171
01:33:15,520 --> 01:33:17,476
- Lulu!
- Charlie!

1172
01:33:20,920 --> 01:33:23,354
Charlie, come here! l got somethin' for ya!

1173
01:33:23,480 --> 01:33:26,870
Why can't you just give me a chance?
Why?! Why?!

1174
01:33:30,880 --> 01:33:33,235
Stop it! Stop it!

1175
01:33:34,760 --> 01:33:36,830
No, no...

1176
01:34:16,360 --> 01:34:19,193
Oh... Oh, God!

1177
01:34:21,760 --> 01:34:23,716
(Charlie groaning)

1178
01:34:28,200 --> 01:34:29,269
Ray!

1179
01:34:29,400 --> 01:34:31,356
No! No!

1180
01:34:32,640 --> 01:34:34,596
No!

1181
01:34:38,560 --> 01:34:41,711
I hate you so much! Stop it!

1182
01:34:42,640 --> 01:34:43,629
Charlie!

1183
01:34:43,760 --> 01:34:44,875
No, Ray!

1184
01:34:49,400 --> 01:34:50,992
(gasps)

1185
01:35:05,920 --> 01:35:08,195
Shit, Charlie.

1186
01:36:18,640 --> 01:36:22,076
I understand that the break-in
occurred an hour ago.

1187
01:36:22,200 --> 01:36:24,156
- Yeah.
- Keys.

1188
01:36:25,080 --> 01:36:27,036
He smashed a window to gain entrance

1189
01:36:27,160 --> 01:36:31,551
and you were forcibly led into the house,
Mr Driggs, through the back.

1190
01:36:31,680 --> 01:36:35,070
I understand that he manacled you
at that time.

1191
01:36:35,280 --> 01:36:37,350
Mr Driggs, did you know him?

1192
01:36:37,920 --> 01:36:39,876
Did you know the guy?

1193
01:36:43,520 --> 01:36:45,715
He was my husband.

1194
01:36:45,840 --> 01:36:47,717
Your husband?

1195
01:36:47,840 --> 01:36:49,671
Ray Sinclair.

1196
01:36:49,800 --> 01:36:51,950
And what is your name?

1197
01:36:52,080 --> 01:36:53,638
Audrey.

1198
01:36:53,960 --> 01:36:56,474
Audrey, you wanna
come with me, please?

1199
01:37:01,200 --> 01:37:02,918
Wait.

1200
01:37:03,360 --> 01:37:06,079
You're not...
You're not taking her away because...

1201
01:37:06,200 --> 01:37:10,478
It's all right. It's OK, Mr Driggs.
We just need to get more information.

1202
01:38:00,160 --> 01:38:01,673
(knocking)

1203
01:38:02,880 --> 01:38:04,836
Charles?

1204
01:38:05,160 --> 01:38:06,878
Larry!

1205
01:38:07,000 --> 01:38:08,831
Hi.

1206
01:38:12,120 --> 01:38:14,076
Listen, uh...

1207
01:38:15,200 --> 01:38:17,430
We're all real sorry about your leaving.

1208
01:38:17,560 --> 01:38:19,073
Oh, that's nice.

1209
01:38:19,200 --> 01:38:21,395
There's no way to get you
to change your mind?

1210
01:38:21,520 --> 01:38:24,193
No. Nope, l don't think so, no.

1211
01:38:24,920 --> 01:38:28,549
- Is there anything l can do?
- No. Everything's been taken care of.

1212
01:38:28,680 --> 01:38:30,636
Everything's fine.

1213
01:38:31,200 --> 01:38:32,952
Well...

1214
01:38:34,360 --> 01:38:35,679
Hey!

1215
01:38:42,400 --> 01:38:44,868
How do you figure
a guy like Ray Sinclair?

1216
01:38:57,240 --> 01:38:59,037
Well...

1217
01:38:59,240 --> 01:39:01,276
Stay in touch. Promise?

1218
01:39:01,560 --> 01:39:03,039
Promise.

1219
01:39:06,600 --> 01:39:08,158
Hey, Larry.

1220
01:39:08,280 --> 01:39:10,953
It's better to be a live dog
than a dead lion.

1221
01:39:12,160 --> 01:39:14,720
It's been good working with you, Charlie.

1222
01:39:17,600 --> 01:39:19,556
# Ooh, yeah

1223
01:39:19,880 --> 01:39:22,314
# You don't have to cry, girl

1224
01:39:26,800 --> 01:39:29,314
# As l look out my window

1225
01:39:29,440 --> 01:39:31,715
# l don't understand what l see

1226
01:39:32,200 --> 01:39:34,760
# Once again we are letting it happen

1227
01:39:35,240 --> 01:39:37,800
# Everywhere, fighting in the streets

1228
01:39:37,920 --> 01:39:40,673
# How can people be dying from hunger?

1229
01:39:40,800 --> 01:39:43,598
# How can they be dying for gasoline?

1230
01:39:43,720 --> 01:39:46,075
# Come here, my child,
hold me for a moment

1231
01:39:46,200 --> 01:39:49,192
# Your eyes are too young
for the suffering they've seen

1232
01:39:49,320 --> 01:39:53,359
- # You don't have to cry, girl
- # Oh, you don't have to cry, girl

1233
01:39:53,480 --> 01:39:55,516
Who is it?

1234
01:39:58,040 --> 01:40:02,238
I'm looking for the woman in 3F.
Lulu is her name, or Audrey.

1235
01:40:02,880 --> 01:40:05,952
I'm in 3F. You must want
the girl that moved out.

1236
01:40:06,080 --> 01:40:08,719
uh... did you talk to her?
l mean, did she say...

1237
01:40:08,840 --> 01:40:12,435
Did she say where she was goin',
or a forwarding address or anything?

1238
01:40:12,560 --> 01:40:14,869
No. I moved in, it was empty.

1239
01:40:15,000 --> 01:40:16,956
OK, thanks.

1240
01:40:18,240 --> 01:40:20,390
- Hey!
- Yeah?

1241
01:40:20,520 --> 01:40:24,433
- Do you know what her rent was?
- Her rent?

1242
01:40:24,560 --> 01:40:29,190
Yeah. This building is rent-stabilised,
but l think the landlord is screwing me.

1243
01:40:30,880 --> 01:40:33,155
Yeah, well, it wouldn't surprise me.

1244
01:40:34,560 --> 01:40:37,393
# Oh, you don't have to cry, girl

1245
01:40:37,520 --> 01:40:40,353
# l'm here to dry your eyes, girl

1246
01:40:40,480 --> 01:40:43,392
# Here to dry your eyes, girl

1247
01:40:43,520 --> 01:40:45,954
# You don't have to cry, girl

1248
01:40:46,080 --> 01:40:48,833
# Oh, you don't have to worry any more

1249
01:40:48,960 --> 01:40:51,838
# l'm here to dry your eyes, girl

1250
01:40:51,960 --> 01:40:55,953
# We are stronger together,
that's for sure

1251
01:40:57,600 --> 01:40:59,033
# Ooh, yeah

1252
01:41:10,720 --> 01:41:13,473
The MP would grab 'em
and confiscate 'em,

1253
01:41:13,600 --> 01:41:16,398
and l'd take 'em back
and l'd sell 'em again.

1254
01:41:23,160 --> 01:41:25,754
- Here's your check, sir.
- Oh, thank you.

1255
01:41:53,520 --> 01:41:57,149
Hey! You didn't pay for your food.
Where you think you're goin'?

1256
01:41:58,400 --> 01:42:00,755
- Come on, mister. I haven't got all day.
- What?

1257
01:42:00,880 --> 01:42:05,192
- You didn't pay for your food.
- Sure l paid, Dottie. I put $5 on the table.

1258
01:42:05,320 --> 01:42:06,878
Do you think l'm stupid?

1259
01:42:07,000 --> 01:42:11,391
Look, it's a mistake. It was a $3.1 5 bill,
l left $5 on the table. That's a healthy tip.

1260
01:42:11,520 --> 01:42:16,230
- Do you expect to eat and not pay?
- All right. It's not that big a deal to me.

1261
01:42:31,880 --> 01:42:35,429
- Keep the, uh... keep the change.
- Sure.

1262
01:42:48,920 --> 01:42:51,115
You never said goodbye.

1263
01:42:52,720 --> 01:42:54,995
I never wanted to say goodbye.

1264
01:42:59,960 --> 01:43:01,996
Want a ride?

1265
01:43:11,520 --> 01:43:13,511
Sure, Audrey.

1266
01:43:13,640 --> 01:43:15,392
Why not?

1267
01:43:22,240 --> 01:43:23,958
