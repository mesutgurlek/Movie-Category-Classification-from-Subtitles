1
00:01:46,999 --> 00:01:50,534
So he wants to cut it off, just like that?

2
00:01:52,129 --> 00:01:57,800
- He doesn't think you can handle it.
- The arrangements have been concluded.

3
00:01:57,885 --> 00:02:02,595
<i>I gave them my word
because he gave me his word.</i>

4
00:02:02,682 --> 00:02:06,976
- So you tell me why.
- Hey, you know why.

5
00:02:08,814 --> 00:02:11,565
You're not strong any more.

6
00:02:12,609 --> 00:02:15,065
You lost control.

7
00:02:16,530 --> 00:02:20,528
Now, you tell him this:
nothing has changed.

8
00:02:20,618 --> 00:02:24,615
We've had a few setbacks.
That's to be expected in any business.

9
00:02:24,705 --> 00:02:28,999
But I am still in charge,
and I am still strong.

10
00:02:29,502 --> 00:02:31,459
Make no mistake.

11
00:02:31,546 --> 00:02:35,294
You tell him he had better keep his word.

12
00:02:35,383 --> 00:02:38,088
Tell him the 25th, as agreed.

13
00:02:39,512 --> 00:02:43,344
I’ll send him a sign, a little demonstration,

14
00:02:44,392 --> 00:02:47,643
to prove that I’m still strong.

15
00:03:28,856 --> 00:03:33,851
- Good afternoon, Mr Douvier.
- Good afternoon, Simone.

16
00:03:37,615 --> 00:03:40,106
- Any calls?
- On your desk.

17
00:03:49,919 --> 00:03:56,040
- What's this ''Dr Herb called''?
- Your yearly checkup. Tuesday at 4.30.

18
00:03:56,134 --> 00:04:01,556
- Is New York gonna call back?
- Mm-hm. Between five and six.

19
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:05,804
- Everybody else here?
- Yes, in the boardroom.

20
00:04:15,404 --> 00:04:20,612
Well, l don't think
we should keep them waiting any longer.

21
00:04:25,206 --> 00:04:29,584
- Will l see you tonight?
- Of course, Miss Legree.

22
00:04:41,807 --> 00:04:47,182
Gentlemen, we have a problem.
The Gannet transaction is in jeopardy

23
00:04:47,271 --> 00:04:52,728
because New York feels l no longer
have the power to control the situation.

24
00:04:52,819 --> 00:04:55,571
So l have sent word

25
00:04:55,655 --> 00:05:00,364
that l will give them
a demonstration, a sign,

26
00:05:01,411 --> 00:05:04,745
to show that l am still in control.

27
00:05:04,831 --> 00:05:08,912
That France is still a viable territory.

28
00:05:09,002 --> 00:05:12,454
What I want from you are suggestions.

29
00:05:13,507 --> 00:05:17,172
- I have an idea.
- All right.

30
00:05:17,261 --> 00:05:22,386
Would you ask your secretary
to bring in the morning paper?

31
00:05:23,601 --> 00:05:27,184
- Bring in the morning paper, please.
- Right away, sir.

32
00:05:31,776 --> 00:05:36,771
Who's the most important man in France?
Present company excluded, of course.

33
00:05:36,865 --> 00:05:39,617
Thank you, Miss Legree.
The president, I suppose.

34
00:05:39,701 --> 00:05:45,621
No, for our purpose. A man New York
knows better than the president of France.

35
00:05:45,707 --> 00:05:49,836
A man with which our entire
world organisation is familiar,

36
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:53,254
and would like nothing better
than to see him out of the way.

37
00:05:53,340 --> 00:05:54,669
Who?

38
00:05:58,554 --> 00:06:02,220
Who has given us nothing but trouble
for the past ten years?

39
00:06:02,308 --> 00:06:06,935
Who has survived
16 assassination attempts,

40
00:06:07,021 --> 00:06:09,726
including two by his own boss?

41
00:06:15,781 --> 00:06:17,026
Clouseau.

42
00:06:17,115 --> 00:06:21,196
You want to impress New York?
Eliminate Clouseau.

43
00:06:21,286 --> 00:06:24,371
We'll have every cop in France
down on our necks.

44
00:06:24,456 --> 00:06:26,745
Not if we do it smart.

45
00:06:26,834 --> 00:06:30,784
There is a rumour
that he is really a complete imbecile.

46
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:34,463
- I’ve heard that.
- Yet he continues to survive.

47
00:06:34,550 --> 00:06:38,548
I have it on good authority
that he is anything but an imbecile.

48
00:06:38,638 --> 00:06:41,343
That he only plays the fool.

49
00:06:42,267 --> 00:06:45,932
In any case, it is too dangerous.

50
00:06:50,859 --> 00:06:53,646
Can you do it smart?

51
00:06:53,737 --> 00:06:55,231
Yes.

52
00:06:56,115 --> 00:06:57,146

You can do it, Inspector!

The bomb destroyed half the block,

I am certain, sir,
that the beum was intended for me.

A man dressed as a woman.

106
00:15:58,474 --> 00:16:01,345
Four armed robberies in three weeks.

107
00:16:01,436 --> 00:16:04,805
Two victims were assaulted,
and grappled with the robber.

108
00:16:04,898 --> 00:16:10,023
Both victims said the robber
was much too strong to be a woman.

109
00:16:10,112 --> 00:16:13,860
Three years ago, we sent to prison
a man named Claude Russo.

00:16:13,949 --> 00:16:17,817
Russo committed robberies
disguised as a woman.

Pardon me, I am needed on the telephone.

Hello? This is Chief Inspector Clouseau

<i>- And come alone.

Yes, or it's so obvious that
he's bound to think it can't be a trap.

183
00:26:16,914 --> 00:26:19,203
It’s so obvious, it's bound to be a trap.

184
00:26:19,292 --> 00:26:22,458
That is why you will never be
a great detective, Cato.

185
00:26:22,545 --> 00:26:25,795
It’s so obvious,
it could not possibly be a trap.

186
00:26:25,882 --> 00:26:30,461
Now, Cato, warm up the Silver Hornet.

187
00:26:54,912 --> 00:27:00,499
Cato, l very much suspect that
the Hornet is overdue for a service.

188
00:27:00,585 --> 00:27:04,749
So if you don't mind,
I’ll use your car tonight.

Oh!

197
00:28:18,250 --> 00:28:25,047
Generally speaking, it's dangerous for a
beautiful girl like you to hitchhike at night.

198
00:28:25,132 --> 00:28:31,301
That's because, generally speaking,
beautiful girls like me don't carry guns.

199
00:28:31,388 --> 00:28:33,465
Yes, yes.

200
00:28:38,813 --> 00:28:42,858
Are you saying that you carry a gun?

201
00:28:42,942 --> 00:28:47,937
Mm-hm. I’ve got it in here somewhere.
It’s not very big.

202
00:28:48,031 --> 00:28:53,026
- Watch it. It might go off.
- Only if you don't do exactly what I say.

Listen, Miss, uh...

<i>(male voice) But you can call me Claude.</i>

- ''Claude''?
- Pull off the road.

207
00:29:07,510 --> 00:29:11,009
The old ''pull off the road'' ploy, eh?

208
00:29:11,097 --> 00:29:16,969
Yes. Then we will see how you do with
the old ''take off all your clothes'' ploy.

209
00:29:46,008 --> 00:29:49,543
lf you don't want to freeze to death,
you'd better put on the dress.

210
00:29:49,637 --> 00:29:51,926
- Never!
- Suit yourself.

211

- Won't be necessary, my dear.

Oh! Am I glad to see you!

And we are certainly glad to see you.

223

Hey, hey, hey!
Wait a moment! Wait a moment!

224
00:31:11,514 --> 00:31:14,219
I am Chief Inspector Clouseau
of the Sûreté!

- And I am Officer Bardot.

But you can call me Brigitte.

Brigitte! You are making
an understandable mistake.

228
00:31:22,317 --> 00:31:25,687
Don't let my legs fool you.
I’m really a man.

<i>(solemn drum roll)</i>

<i>(man) The palace flag

<i>The president has declared
a day of national mourning.</i>

232
00:31:38,668 --> 00:31:44,457
<i>Only a few hours ago, the great detective
stood in this very courtyard,</i>

233
00:31:44,549 --> 00:31:50,469
<i>and was decorated by the president
for outstanding service to his country.</i>

234
00:31:50,555 --> 00:31:53,011
<i>According to the coroner's report,</i>

235
00:31:53,100 --> 00:31:56,551
<i>Chief Inspector Clouseau
was probably dead</i>

236
00:31:56,645 --> 00:32:01,853
<i>before his car hit the telephone pole
and burst into flames.</i>

237
00:32:06,113 --> 00:32:09,317
The president called me
at six o'clock this morning.

238
00:32:09,408 --> 00:32:13,241
A dozen countries have offered
the services of their finest detectives,

239
00:32:13,329 --> 00:32:15,785
but the president made it painfully clear

240
00:32:15,874 --> 00:32:18,828
that this must be solved
by Frenchmen, and quickly.

241
00:32:18,918 --> 00:32:23,213
- Or we can all hand in our resignations.
- l spoke with Dr Laprone at the hospital.

242
00:32:23,298 --> 00:32:27,545
He assures me
that Dreyfus is completely cured.

243
00:32:27,636 --> 00:32:29,178
It’s amazing.

244
00:32:29,263 --> 00:32:34,174
I’ve seen some lunatics in my time, but
they were all pikers compared to Dreyfus.

245
00:32:34,268 --> 00:32:37,637
- He was like a wild animal!
- Didn't he actually bite you?

246
00:32:37,730 --> 00:32:41,016
Oh, yes. On the leg.

247
00:32:41,108 --> 00:32:43,600
l had to take rabies shots, just in case.

248
00:32:43,694 --> 00:32:46,268
The doctor swears
his recovery is complete.

249
00:32:46,364 --> 00:32:51,240
He said that in the last 12 hours,
Dreyfus has literally become a new man.

250
00:32:51,327 --> 00:32:53,404
<i>Thank God for that, because we need him.</i>

251
00:32:53,496 --> 00:32:57,328
<i>lf anyone knows about Clouseau
and who might have murdered him,</i>

252
00:32:57,417 --> 00:33:00,667
<i>that man is former
Chief Inspector Charles Dreyfus.</i>

253
00:33:01,546 --> 00:33:03,872
Isn't it fantastic, Doctor?

254
00:33:03,966 --> 00:33:08,592
Reinstated at my former rank,
with no loss of pay or social benefits.

255
00:33:08,679 --> 00:33:12,214
Yes. It could actually be called
a psychic rebirth.

256
00:33:12,308 --> 00:33:15,225
I’m in your debt.
l shall be eternally grateful.

257
00:33:15,311 --> 00:33:17,932
l only helped. l led the way.

258
00:33:18,022 --> 00:33:21,522
But in the final analysis,
it was your victory, Charles.

259
00:33:21,609 --> 00:33:23,732
<i>Our victory, Paul. (laughs)</i>

260
00:33:23,820 --> 00:33:26,192
But only at the expense of another.

261
00:33:26,281 --> 00:33:29,033
Huh? Oh, Clouseau, you mean.

262
00:33:29,117 --> 00:33:33,578
It could be said that he died
so that you might live.

263
00:33:33,663 --> 00:33:37,448
- l wish l could feel sorry.
- You feel no guilt?

264
00:33:37,542 --> 00:33:39,369
None.

265
00:33:39,461 --> 00:33:42,498
To be honest,
when l first heard he was dead,

266
00:33:42,589 --> 00:33:46,670
there were a few moments
when l was actually convinced

267
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:49,797
<i>l was in a state of grace. (laughs)</i>

268
00:33:49,889 --> 00:33:54,017
- Is that wrong?
- It isn't a matter of right or wrong.

269
00:33:54,102 --> 00:33:56,141
Look, l hated him.

270
00:33:56,229 --> 00:33:59,680
He literally drove me
out of my mind, as you know.

271
00:33:59,774 --> 00:34:03,523
Isn’t it natural that
l should feel happiness, even joy,

272
00:34:03,611 --> 00:34:08,321
at the thought of him being dead,
out of the way, and gone for ever?

273
00:34:08,408 --> 00:34:13,366
Natural, yes. But there is a danger
that such feelings might promote guilt.

274
00:34:13,455 --> 00:34:16,160
Clouseau would come back
and haunt you.

275
00:34:16,250 --> 00:34:19,037
- I have no guilt.
- Not now.

276
00:34:19,128 --> 00:34:23,956
Not ever. Clouseau is gone,
and I am free, for ever.

277
00:34:24,050 --> 00:34:27,834
- Now, have a cigar.
- Thank you, Charles.

278
00:34:27,929 --> 00:34:30,384
I’ve made the arrangements
for your release.

279
00:34:30,473 --> 00:34:33,509
The Sûreté is sending a car

and checking parking meters.

287

Miss or Mrs?

291
00:35:11,933 --> 00:35:15,468
You fool! The president himself,
when he decorated me, said:

292
00:35:15,562 --> 00:35:18,433
''Clouseau, you are a man of courage.''

293
00:35:18,523 --> 00:35:21,311
He called me
the greatest detective in all of France!

294
00:35:21,401 --> 00:35:24,402
You charlatan! Impostor!

295
00:35:24,488 --> 00:35:27,240
All right. Calm down, Mr Poirot.

296
00:35:27,324 --> 00:35:29,696

00:37:07,179 --> 00:37:10,299
Goodbye, Chief Inspector Dreyfus.

312
00:37:20,443 --> 00:37:25,864
<i>- Good evening, Chief Inspector Dreyfus.
- (gruffly) Good evening, François.</i>

313
00:37:29,869 --> 00:37:33,155
It’s good to have you back on the job,
Chief Inspector.

314
00:37:33,248 --> 00:37:37,080
Is it true that you will take charge
of the Clouseau investigation?

315
00:37:37,169 --> 00:37:40,039
- Yes, yes.
- You must feel torn.

316
00:37:40,130 --> 00:37:45,255
On the one hand, it is your duty to send
the guilty parties to the guillotine.

317
00:37:45,344 --> 00:37:48,428
<i>On the other hand... (laughs)</i>

318
00:37:48,514 --> 00:37:52,428
I am sure you'd rather
congratulate them, eh?

319
00:37:52,518 --> 00:37:55,139
Can you imagine?
A state funeral for that idiot?

320
00:37:55,229 --> 00:37:58,645
The president. Dignitaries from
all over the world will be coming.

321
00:37:58,733 --> 00:38:02,232
Why, there's a rumour
the Pope might even show up.

322
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:04,396
The Peup?

323
00:38:05,865 --> 00:38:08,072
- ''Peup''?
- What?

324
00:38:08,159 --> 00:38:10,236
You said ''Peup''.

325
00:38:10,328 --> 00:38:13,744
- Do you have a cold?
- Oh, yes. Yes, I have.

326
00:38:13,832 --> 00:38:16,323
I have the cold in the chest, you know.

327
00:38:17,294 --> 00:38:20,461
You sound terrible.
Do you want me to send you a doctor?

328
00:38:20,547 --> 00:38:23,751
No, no. It’s much better than it sounds.

329
00:38:23,842 --> 00:38:27,425
Anyway, I want to go directly
to the Clouseau apartments

330
00:38:27,513 --> 00:38:30,348
to commence the search for the clues.

331
00:38:30,433 --> 00:38:31,595
Yes, sir.

332
00:38:58,754 --> 00:39:02,337
- Is this the Clouseau residence?
- Yes.

333
00:39:08,931 --> 00:39:14,637
This is also the residence
of the Clouseau manservant, Cato Fong?

334
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:17,354
Yes.

335
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:23,230
Then be so good as to tell him that l wish
to have speaks with him, would you?

336
00:39:23,321 --> 00:39:28,233
And who should l say
''wish to have speaks'' with Mr Fong?

337
00:39:29,661 --> 00:39:31,987
Tell him it is an old friend.

338
00:39:32,081 --> 00:39:34,572
Mr Fong has many old friends.

339
00:39:34,667 --> 00:39:36,410
Listen, you.

340
00:39:36,502 --> 00:39:42,920
Tell him it is Chief Inspector... Clouseau.

341
00:39:43,009 --> 00:39:47,967
Why didn't you say so in the first place?
Please come in.

342
00:39:57,983 --> 00:39:59,442
Good evening.

343
00:39:59,526 --> 00:40:02,313
- And congratulations.
- What?

344
00:40:02,404 --> 00:40:04,278
You are our first Caucasian,

345
00:40:04,364 --> 00:40:08,232
and that entitles you
to a 10º/% discount until midnight.

346
00:40:08,327 --> 00:40:11,447
- Who are you?
- Mrs Wu. But you can call me Madam.

347
00:40:11,539 --> 00:40:13,412
<i>(doorbell)</i>

348
00:40:14,834 --> 00:40:17,242
- Yes?
- Inspector Clouseau.

349
00:40:17,336 --> 00:40:20,006
Oh! Please come in.

350
00:40:20,089 --> 00:40:22,296
- Madam.
- Welcome.

351
00:40:22,383 --> 00:40:26,631
- Good evening.
- Please, make yourself at home.

352
00:40:27,681 --> 00:40:30,385
That man just called himself
Inspector Clouseau.

353
00:40:30,475 --> 00:40:35,351
It was Mr Fong's idea, but personally,
I think we should have a better password.

354
00:40:35,439 --> 00:40:37,313
Password?!

355
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:48,024
Madam, l demand to know
exactly what is going on in here.

356
00:40:48,119 --> 00:40:51,488
Well, just about anything
your little heart desires.

357
00:40:51,581 --> 00:40:54,250
But first, why don't you relax?

358
00:40:54,333 --> 00:40:59,708
Give Benson your hat and your coat,
have a drink, get to know the girls.

359
00:40:59,798 --> 00:41:01,956
And then, when you are up to it,

360
00:41:02,050 --> 00:41:07,257
you can choose from a wide variety
of exciting little diversions.

361
00:41:10,058 --> 00:41:13,890
But I see that
you already have a preference.

362
00:41:23,948 --> 00:41:28,160
Allow me to introduce
Tanya, the Lotus Eater.

363
00:41:29,203 --> 00:41:32,074
What else does she do?

364
00:41:37,545 --> 00:41:40,749
l warn you, Tanya the Easter Lotus,

365
00:41:40,841 --> 00:41:44,174
I am opposed to the women's libs.

366
00:41:45,220 --> 00:41:49,384
Man is the master,
and women's place is in the home.

367
00:41:49,475 --> 00:41:51,017
<i>- (whip swishes)
- Ooh! Ow!</i>

368
00:41:51,560 --> 00:41:54,894
And another round-eye bites the dust.

369
00:41:54,980 --> 00:41:57,057
<i>- (whip)
- Aagh! Aaaow!</i>

370
00:42:06,868 --> 00:42:08,944
Cato!

371
00:42:12,958 --> 00:42:15,034
Aaagh! Ooh!

372
00:42:17,129 --> 00:42:21,079
Take your hands off me, you oriental fool!
You are under arrest!

373
00:42:21,174 --> 00:42:24,840
- Anything you say will be taken down...
- Arrest?!

374
00:42:24,928 --> 00:42:28,214
You have the right to remain silent,
but let me tell you this:

375
00:42:28,307 --> 00:42:31,510
I am not your ordinary,
run-of-the-mill transvestite.

376
00:42:31,602 --> 00:42:34,639
- Say no more!
- What was that talk about arresting us?

377
00:42:34,730 --> 00:42:37,648
- He was just kidding, weren't you, boss?
- Boss?

378
00:42:37,733 --> 00:42:39,940
l used to work for him.
He used to be a cop.

379
00:42:40,028 --> 00:42:43,776
- A cop?!
- Tell them you were kidding, boss.

380
00:42:45,158 --> 00:42:47,993
Yes, he is right.

381
00:42:48,078 --> 00:42:50,995
l was just kidding.

382
00:42:51,081 --> 00:42:56,206
Cross my heart and...
hope to meet you again sometime.

383
00:42:56,295 --> 00:42:58,702
And you, Madam.

384
00:42:58,797 --> 00:43:03,091
And you, too. You two
should be ashamed of yourselves.

385
00:43:03,177 --> 00:43:06,427
And you! I want to talk to you, Cato!

386
00:43:06,514 --> 00:43:10,298
- Here. Come in here. Listen now.
- Please, boss!

387
00:43:10,643 --> 00:43:11,923
l thought you were dead!

388
00:43:12,019 --> 00:43:18,473
So, as a tribute to my memory, you
open up this... Chinese nooky factory!

389
00:43:18,985 --> 00:43:23,149
l had to do something to keep busy.
Besides, a first-rate joint like this

390
00:43:23,240 --> 00:43:28,067
can make as much as
three, four hundred thousand a year!

391
00:43:29,121 --> 00:43:31,493
- Is that net?
- No, gross.

392
00:43:31,582 --> 00:43:35,330
But even so, a smart operator
can clear a coupla hundred grand,

393
00:43:35,419 --> 00:43:37,744
and that ain't exactly chicken feed.

394
00:43:37,838 --> 00:43:39,119
No.

395
00:43:39,215 --> 00:43:45,051
No, and ten years on Devil's Island
ain't exactly the chicken's feed either,

396
00:43:45,137 --> 00:43:47,296
my greedy little yellow pimp.

397
00:43:47,390 --> 00:43:48,635
Ow!

398
00:43:48,725 --> 00:43:52,010
<i>I’ll have to close up anyway,
now that you're alive.</i>

399
00:43:52,103 --> 00:43:58,189
Yes. Yes, normally that is
precisely what you would have to do.

400
00:43:58,276 --> 00:44:01,977
But these are not normal times, Cato.

401
00:44:02,072 --> 00:44:04,943
- Someone has just tried to kill me.
- That's normal.

402
00:44:05,033 --> 00:44:09,162
Ah, but this time
that someone thinks he has succeeded.

403
00:44:09,288 --> 00:44:13,499
Except for you and me,
the whole world believes that I am dead.

404
00:44:13,584 --> 00:44:17,534
And in this case, death has its advantages.

405
00:44:20,383 --> 00:44:22,506
No one will know it is me

406
00:44:22,593 --> 00:44:25,049
<i>as I glide... (coughs)</i>

407
00:44:25,138 --> 00:44:28,092
through the underworld like a shadow.

408
00:44:30,101 --> 00:44:34,645
<i>- Good evening, Commissioner.
- Charles! (laughs)</i>

409
00:44:34,731 --> 00:44:36,605
I, uh...

410
00:44:37,734 --> 00:44:38,849
Thank you.

411
00:44:38,944 --> 00:44:44,864
I’m sorry to be late, but as you must have
heard, a lunatic was hiding in my closet.

412
00:44:44,950 --> 00:44:47,157
Yes. Russo.

413
00:44:47,244 --> 00:44:48,988
Russo?

414
00:44:49,079 --> 00:44:50,823
Russo...

415
00:44:50,915 --> 00:44:53,702
- Ah!
- You remember?

416
00:44:53,793 --> 00:44:56,498
Why wouldn't I?
It was only three years ago.

417
00:44:56,587 --> 00:44:59,505
Of course. Claude Russo.

418
00:44:59,590 --> 00:45:03,671
Alias Claudine Russo.
Armed robbery, dressed as a woman.

419
00:45:03,762 --> 00:45:05,553
But he got five years.

420
00:45:05,638 --> 00:45:08,805
He was released on parole
three months ago.

421
00:45:08,892 --> 00:45:11,300
So it could have been Russo.

422
00:45:11,395 --> 00:45:13,636
He's clever.

423
00:45:13,730 --> 00:45:16,648
- Clever enough to fool François?
- Huh!

424
00:45:17,401 --> 00:45:20,188
l like François, but fooling him

425
00:45:20,279 --> 00:45:25,618
no longer constitutes an act of more
than average cleverness, shall we say?

426
00:45:29,372 --> 00:45:32,622
l always thought
he was rather a good policeman.

427
00:45:32,708 --> 00:45:37,454
When he was my assistant, he was a very
good policeman, with a bright future.

428
00:45:37,547 --> 00:45:41,130
- But then he was assigned to Clouseau.
- Oh, now, now, Charles.

429
00:45:41,217 --> 00:45:44,218
- All that's in the past.
- Yes, of course.

430
00:45:45,138 --> 00:45:49,006
Tomorrow morning,
when they plant him six feet deep

431
00:45:49,101 --> 00:45:51,508
<i>and shovel in the dirt... (laughs)</i>

432
00:45:51,603 --> 00:45:54,391
l shall be truly free.

433
00:45:54,481 --> 00:45:58,610
And unless he's figured out
a way to come back from the dead,

434
00:45:58,694 --> 00:46:03,237
nothing anyone does or says about him
will ever make any difference again.

435
00:46:03,324 --> 00:46:07,073
- Shall we do some work?
- That reminds me.

436
00:46:09,163 --> 00:46:13,624
- What is it?
- The chief wants you to give the eulogy.

437
00:46:13,710 --> 00:46:16,035
- The what?
- The tribute.

438
00:46:16,129 --> 00:46:18,834
- Me?!
- You knew him intimately.

439
00:46:18,924 --> 00:46:20,715
l hated him intimately.

440
00:46:20,801 --> 00:46:24,798
But you're the expert who's
going to track down his murderers.

441
00:46:24,888 --> 00:46:28,838
I’m the expert who
would love to kiss his murderers!

442
00:46:28,934 --> 00:46:31,769
<i>The PR people loved the angle.</i>

443
00:46:33,105 --> 00:46:35,394
It’s sacrilege! l won't do it.

444
00:46:35,483 --> 00:46:36,858
Politics.

445
00:46:36,942 --> 00:46:39,350
No. I’m a good Catholic.

446
00:46:39,445 --> 00:46:42,115
- So's the chief's wife.
- I don't care.

447
00:46:42,198 --> 00:46:44,570
What's she got to do with it?

448
00:46:44,659 --> 00:46:46,865
She wrote the speech.

449
00:46:48,037 --> 00:46:49,995
Ladies and gentlemen,

450
00:46:51,166 --> 00:46:53,538
honoured guests,

451
00:46:53,627 --> 00:46:55,370
<i>dear friends. (clears throat)</i>

452
00:46:56,755 --> 00:47:01,832
We are gathered here to say... goodbye

453
00:47:01,927 --> 00:47:04,085
to a, uh...

454
00:47:05,973 --> 00:47:08,345
a great man.

455
00:47:08,434 --> 00:47:10,058
<i>(stifles laugh)</i>

456
00:47:10,811 --> 00:47:12,887
<i>(coughs)</i>

457
00:47:13,481 --> 00:47:17,431
Not only was he a model police officer,

458
00:47:17,527 --> 00:47:19,934
a brilliant detective,

459
00:47:22,031 --> 00:47:26,361
admired and respected
by his fellow officers,

460
00:47:26,911 --> 00:47:31,040
and all those
who were fortunate enough...

461
00:47:32,084 --> 00:47:34,290
enough...

462
00:47:34,378 --> 00:47:36,454
enough to know him.

463
00:47:37,673 --> 00:47:40,246
He was, above all else,

464
00:47:42,094 --> 00:47:44,170
a modest man.

465

- She's got enough evidence to ruin me.

If anything happens to her, her attorney
will give it to the authorities!

- Then get rid of the authorities!

It’s not that I love her. You know I don't.
I just need her respectability.

- Oh. The old déjà vu. Thank you.
- You're welcome.

619
01:02:29,524 --> 01:02:31,398
- You OK?
- Yes.

620
01:02:32,444 --> 01:02:34,732
Ah! That feels good.

621
01:02:36,990 --> 01:02:40,110
That won't do you much good
if you don't take your pants off.

622
01:02:40,202 --> 01:02:43,535
- What?
- You gotta take your pants off.

623
01:02:43,622 --> 01:02:48,415
Look at me. Look, I’m shaking like a leaf.

624
01:02:48,502 --> 01:02:52,963
I can't stop shaking. I don't know...
Oh, I know what it is.

625
01:02:53,049 --> 01:02:57,592
I’m just not used to being killed.
That's my first time, you know?

626
01:02:57,678 --> 01:03:00,170
I know. But listen.

627
01:03:00,264 --> 01:03:05,472
When you have been killed as many times
as I have, you get used to it, believe me.

628
01:03:05,562 --> 01:03:09,262
- Really?
- Yes. Oh, yes, yes. Yes indeed.

629
01:03:09,357 --> 01:03:11,599
I’ll put this here, keep it nice and warm.

630
01:03:11,693 --> 01:03:13,769
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

631
01:03:15,197 --> 01:03:18,815
- Oh. This is for you.
- Oh, yes. Yes, of course.

632
01:03:18,909 --> 01:03:22,444
- Then this must be yours.
- Thank you. Cheers.

633
01:03:22,538 --> 01:03:24,032
Cheers.

634
01:03:24,123 --> 01:03:29,081
Yes. Anyway... you have nothing to fear.

635
01:03:29,170 --> 01:03:31,079
- Yes, I have.
- No, you don't.

636
01:03:31,297 --> 01:03:33,254
- Yes, I have.
- No, you don't.

637
01:03:33,341 --> 01:03:35,499
- I have.
- No. You see,

638
01:03:36,552 --> 01:03:38,794
I am an officer of the Ieu.

639
01:03:39,848 --> 01:03:42,932
- The Ieu?
- What?

640
01:03:43,602 --> 01:03:47,018
You said you were an officer of the Ieu?

641
01:03:47,105 --> 01:03:51,399
That is correct. Yes, yes.
I am a chief inspector of the Sûreté.

642
01:03:53,070 --> 01:03:54,730
What?

643
01:03:54,822 --> 01:03:57,229
You doubt me.

644
01:03:57,324 --> 01:04:00,029
No, I don't doubt you.

645
01:04:00,119 --> 01:04:02,610
- Why should l doubt you?
- That's right.

646
01:04:02,705 --> 01:04:04,662
lf you say so, l don't.

647
01:04:04,749 --> 01:04:07,156
Who were those two men
who tried to kill you?

648
01:04:07,251 --> 01:04:09,707
- Killers.
- Killers? How do you know?

649
01:04:09,796 --> 01:04:13,544
- I know because I worked for Douvier.
- Douvier? I know that name.

650
01:04:13,633 --> 01:04:17,049
Everyone in France knows it.
He's a millionaire businessman.

651
01:04:17,137 --> 01:04:21,004
Of course. Douvier the millionaire
businessman. l knew l knew it.

652
01:04:21,099 --> 01:04:24,385
But how many people do you think know

653
01:04:24,478 --> 01:04:29,187
that Douvier the millionaire businessman
is also Douvier the French Connection?

654
01:04:29,274 --> 01:04:31,766
Hm? How many?

655
01:04:34,530 --> 01:04:37,103
Well, I suppose his mother, for one.

656
01:04:37,199 --> 01:04:39,607
Why do you suppose
he wanted to have me killed?

657
01:04:39,702 --> 01:04:42,110
Elementary. He wanted you dead.

658
01:04:42,205 --> 01:04:44,281
Oh!

659
01:04:45,208 --> 01:04:48,493
It’s nothing. Just a slight singe.

660
01:04:49,546 --> 01:04:52,630
- I’m sorry about your robe.
- Oh, that's all right.

661
01:04:52,716 --> 01:04:55,254
Tell me about this Douvier.

662
01:04:56,928 --> 01:05:00,262
I was his mistress and
his private secretary for two years.

663
01:05:00,349 --> 01:05:05,343
I know enough about Philippe to
send him to prison for his whole life.

664
01:05:08,357 --> 01:05:12,225
You keep talking about this Douvier.

665
01:05:12,319 --> 01:05:15,486
But Philippe... Who is Philippe?

666
01:05:15,990 --> 01:05:18,279
- Philippe Douvier.
- His son?

667
01:05:18,367 --> 01:05:20,277
Whose son? He has no son.

668
01:05:20,370 --> 01:05:22,612
- His brother, then.
- His name's Fred.

669
01:05:22,705 --> 01:05:25,031
- Then it has to be his father.
- He's dead.

670
01:05:25,125 --> 01:05:27,746
Now we're getting somewhere.
Who killed him?

671
01:05:27,836 --> 01:05:31,964
- He died of natural causes.
- Then who is this Philippe?!

672
01:05:32,048 --> 01:05:35,085
I wanna see some identification.
Right now.

673
01:05:35,177 --> 01:05:38,795
- What?
- Now. I wanna see some identification.

674
01:05:38,889 --> 01:05:45,391
lf you're not a policeman then l shouldn't
be telling you any of these things.

675
01:05:46,856 --> 01:05:51,103
- Can you keep a secret?
- I don't know. That depends.

676
01:05:52,153 --> 01:05:56,020
Then brace yourself
for what l am about to tell you.

677
01:05:56,115 --> 01:05:58,404
I am none other...

678
01:05:59,786 --> 01:06:03,487
than Chief Inspector Jacques Clouseau.

679
01:06:03,582 --> 01:06:05,408
No, you're not.

680
01:06:05,500 --> 01:06:07,991
- Yes, I am.
- No, you're not.

681
01:06:09,046 --> 01:06:12,082
- I am.
- You're not.

682
01:06:12,174 --> 01:06:14,926
- I am.
- You're not. You are not!

683
01:06:15,010 --> 01:06:17,299
Look.

684
01:06:17,388 --> 01:06:19,215
Yes, you are.

685
01:06:20,057 --> 01:06:21,551
Oh, my God.

686
01:06:21,642 --> 01:06:24,560
I admit it's not
a very good photograph, but...

687
01:06:24,645 --> 01:06:27,219
But l saw your funeral on television.

688
01:06:27,315 --> 01:06:30,648
Yes. Even the Peup was there, you know.

689
01:06:30,735 --> 01:06:32,609
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

690
01:06:32,695 --> 01:06:35,946
But if you're not dead, who's dead?

691
01:06:37,409 --> 01:06:43,447
A wandering transvestite took my car
and stole my clothes at gunpoint.

692
01:06:43,540 --> 01:06:47,205
I have been working under the covers
tracking the killer.

693
01:06:47,294 --> 01:06:49,915
- The killer's Douvier.
- What?

694
01:06:50,005 --> 01:06:53,540
He wanted to impress the Godfather.

695
01:06:53,634 --> 01:06:59,589
You mean Douvier killed a wandering
transvestite just to impress his godfather?

696
01:06:59,682 --> 01:07:01,840
<i>- Yes!
- (rattling)</i>

697
01:07:01,934 --> 01:07:05,635
<i>- The man's unthinkable!
- (whispers) The door.</i>

698
01:07:05,730 --> 01:07:08,897
- What's wrong with it?
- l saw the knob turn.

699
01:07:08,983 --> 01:07:11,023
<i>(gunshots)</i>

700
01:07:35,428 --> 01:07:37,634
Oh, hurry!

701
01:07:37,722 --> 01:07:40,260
- I wonder whose apartment this is.
- I don't know.

702
01:07:44,020 --> 01:07:48,682
- The other one's probably in my room.
- How do you know there's another one?

703
01:07:48,775 --> 01:07:51,895
Philippe's assassins travel in pairs.
It’s a company rule.

704
01:07:51,987 --> 01:07:55,356
Do you know
what the Gannet transaction is?

705
01:07:55,449 --> 01:07:58,201
- What is that?
- It’s a code name

706
01:07:58,285 --> 01:08:00,657
for a 50-million-franc heroin sale.

707
01:08:00,746 --> 01:08:02,537
50 million francs?!

708
01:08:02,623 --> 01:08:06,158
Philippe's going to Hong Kong
on Tuesday to meet the American buyer.

709
01:08:06,252 --> 01:08:09,169
- Hong Kong?
- I don't know how it fits in,

710
01:08:09,255 --> 01:08:11,461
<i>but the Gannet's a boat.</i>

711
01:08:12,425 --> 01:08:14,299
<i>(karate yell)</i>

712
01:08:19,516 --> 01:08:22,054
What are you doing?

713
01:08:23,895 --> 01:08:26,351
Now l know why this place
looked so familiar.

714
01:08:26,440 --> 01:08:29,643
Chief Inspector Dreyfus lives here.

715
01:08:32,946 --> 01:08:35,651
I think he has received a faint.

716
01:08:37,117 --> 01:08:40,237
Wake up, Chief Inspector. Wake up.

717
01:08:40,329 --> 01:08:42,654
Chief Inspector!

718
01:08:42,748 --> 01:08:46,497
Hello? Are you in there, Chief Inspector?

719
01:08:46,586 --> 01:08:48,210
Hello?

720
01:08:49,213 --> 01:08:50,756
There's no reply.

721
01:08:50,840 --> 01:08:54,790
It’s no use. I think we will
have to go to Hong Kong without him.

722
01:08:55,261 --> 01:08:56,637
- ''We''?
- Yes.

723
01:08:56,721 --> 01:09:02,475
- You, l and Cato, who will translate for us.
- Not me. I am not going to Hong Kong.

724
01:09:02,561 --> 01:09:06,261
- Douvier would shoot me on sight.
- Not if he doesn't recognise you.

725
01:09:06,356 --> 01:09:08,930
- And he won't.
- Why not?

726
01:09:10,110 --> 01:09:14,523
We will leave that up to the great Balls.

727
01:09:15,991 --> 01:09:18,115
''The great balls''?

728
01:09:19,245 --> 01:09:24,915
At your service! Please forgive
the condition of my establishment,

729
01:09:25,001 --> 01:09:29,912
<i>but as the inspector knows -
the chief inspector knows...</i>

730
01:09:30,006 --> 01:09:32,046
- Auguste!
- Argh!

731
01:09:32,133 --> 01:09:36,427
- I’m so sorry. I beg your pardon.
- But as the chief inspector knows,

732
01:09:36,513 --> 01:09:39,514
- we were bombed.
- It sounds like you still are.

733
01:09:39,600 --> 01:09:43,218
Almost all my collection
was either destroyed or damaged.

734
01:09:43,312 --> 01:09:47,179
Starting Monday, I have to have a fire sale.

735
01:09:47,274 --> 01:09:49,730
You could call it
''The Great Balls of Fire Sale''.

736
01:09:49,819 --> 01:09:52,107
A catchy suggestion!

737
01:09:53,572 --> 01:09:54,948
<i>(blows) Cunny!</i>

738
01:09:55,032 --> 01:09:57,108
<i>(grunting)</i>

739
01:10:02,457 --> 01:10:06,455
l can't tell you how good it is
to see that you are still alive.

740
01:10:06,544 --> 01:10:11,207
It has been my privilege to serve
the good inspector - the chief inspector -

741
01:10:11,299 --> 01:10:12,959
for all these many years.

742
01:10:13,051 --> 01:10:15,293
Thirteen, to be precise.

743
01:10:15,387 --> 01:10:19,800
And his reported demise
was a real blow to me.

744
01:10:19,892 --> 01:10:22,015
Something's coming.

745
01:10:22,102 --> 01:10:24,973
Yes! Yes, Cunny! You are not dreaming.

746
01:10:25,064 --> 01:10:28,896
Our friend, our customer, is alive!

747
01:10:28,985 --> 01:10:31,061
Hello, Cunny.

748
01:10:32,071 --> 01:10:35,191
Now, how can l serve you?

749
01:10:35,283 --> 01:10:39,115
- Well...
- Through wind and mud, snow and hail,

750
01:10:39,204 --> 01:10:42,158
whether long or short, dark or pale.

751
01:10:42,248 --> 01:10:45,665
Remember that when duty calls,

752
01:10:45,752 --> 01:10:47,544
you've got Balls.

753
01:10:47,629 --> 01:10:49,171
<i>(clap of thunder)</i>

754
01:10:51,800 --> 01:10:55,252
- l gotta sit down.
- Yes, of course. Cunny! Quick!

755
01:10:55,346 --> 01:10:57,753
Please, please! Come along.

756
01:10:57,848 --> 01:11:00,422
That's right. There you are. Sit.

757
01:11:00,518 --> 01:11:04,101
- Come, come, come. Sit, sit, sit.
- You're not serious?

758
01:11:04,188 --> 01:11:07,604
There has been no time
to get new furniture.

759
01:11:07,692 --> 01:11:11,690
Since the blast,
he's much more comfortable. Please, sit.

760
01:11:11,779 --> 01:11:15,943
As a matter of fact,
I’ve been sleeping on him.

761
01:11:17,577 --> 01:11:18,822
Chief Inspector?

762
01:11:18,912 --> 01:11:21,747
I am leaving for Hong Kong
first thing in the morning.

763
01:11:21,832 --> 01:11:23,540
Hong Kong?

764
01:11:23,625 --> 01:11:27,706
Do you think you could pick me up
some cheap coolie hats?

765
01:11:27,796 --> 01:11:31,462
My dear Auguste,
I need your best Hong Kong disguise.

766
01:11:31,550 --> 01:11:35,678
Also, l will need something
extra special in the Godfather line.

767
01:11:36,347 --> 01:11:38,755
Doctor, please. You must help me.

768
01:11:38,849 --> 01:11:43,179
Is Clouseau real,
or am I going mad again?

769
01:11:43,271 --> 01:11:46,854
- What do you think?
- What do I think? What can l think?

770
01:11:46,941 --> 01:11:52,316
lf that nincompoop is really alive,

What choice do I have?

I either commit myself and come back
to be locked up in here, or...

I go to Hong Kong.

Certainly, Mr Algo.

Guy Algo, Philippe's right-hand man.

This Scallini must be

Listen. We'll go up to the room.

Right. Come, Ming Loy.

Scallini's down the hall in the Tang suite.

923
01:32:25,656 --> 01:32:28,408
and I am warning you
that if you are not careful,

924
01:32:28,492 --> 01:32:31,659
I will arrest you all in the name of the Ieu!

925
01:32:37,168 --> 01:32:38,746
You and your bright ideas.

926
01:32:38,836 --> 01:32:41,244
Let me get my hands on you.

927
01:32:41,798 --> 01:32:43,625
<i>(Dreyfus) Clouseau?</i>

928
01:32:43,716 --> 01:32:45,709
Yes?

929
01:32:45,802 --> 01:32:48,637
- Are you wounded?
- No!

930
01:32:48,722 --> 01:32:51,925
Fortunately l was saved by the darkness.

931
01:32:52,017 --> 01:32:54,590
So what we need is more light.

932
01:33:00,901 --> 01:33:04,946
Look what you did to my shoes!
Oh, I’ll kill you!

933
01:33:36,855 --> 01:33:39,144
Hello, Philippe.

934
01:33:39,233 --> 01:33:40,312
Simone!

935
01:33:40,401 --> 01:33:44,102
- What are you doing here?
- Waiting for the firecrackers to go off.

936
01:33:44,196 --> 01:33:47,696
- What firecrackers?
- The ones l just stuck in your pants.

937
01:33:47,784 --> 01:33:49,242
<i>(bang)</i>

938
01:34:29,327 --> 01:34:31,403
<i>(drum tattoo)</i>

939
01:34:52,393 --> 01:34:54,469
<i>( rousing march)</i>

940
01:36:18,024 --> 01:36:21,358
- Hello! I’m so sorry I’m late.
- i was a little worried.

941
01:36:21,445 --> 01:36:26,107
I had some rather important
police business to attend to.

942
01:36:26,200 --> 01:36:28,773
- And everything's all right?
- Absolutely fine.

943
01:36:28,869 --> 01:36:31,277
Allow me to let you in the car.

944
01:36:31,372 --> 01:36:34,123
- Please.
- It’s beautiful.

945
01:36:34,208 --> 01:36:39,000
It’s rather neat, isn't it?
I call it the Silver Hornet.

946
01:36:47,722 --> 01:36:49,964
Yes... Service, service.

947
01:36:51,017 --> 01:36:55,596
It’s a little overdue
for a service, unfortunately.

948
01:36:58,734 --> 01:37:02,399
Perhaps it's better to leave that there.

949
01:37:02,488 --> 01:37:07,648
- It’s a beautiful night. Why don't we walk?
- What an excellent idea.

950
01:37:07,743 --> 01:37:10,614
- I’m sorry about that.
- That's quite all right.

951
01:37:10,705 --> 01:37:13,824
- You look ravishing tonight.
- Yes, I know that.

952
01:37:13,916 --> 01:37:15,660
- You know that?
- Yes.

953
01:37:15,751 --> 01:37:19,666
- Yes, l knew that you knew that.
- You did? l knew you knew l knew that.

954
01:37:19,756 --> 01:37:22,163
What made you decide
to become a detective?

955
01:37:22,258 --> 01:37:26,719
Well, it's not something
one decides every day of the week.

956
01:37:26,805 --> 01:37:30,388
But in my case, it began
when my great-aunt was kidnapped

957
01:37:30,475 --> 01:37:35,054
and held for ransom by
an unlicensed Armenian phrenologist.

958
01:37:35,147 --> 01:37:37,353
An Armenian phrenologist?

959
01:37:37,441 --> 01:37:41,770
Yes. You know, a man
who reads the beumps on your head.

960
01:37:41,862 --> 01:37:43,522
- The beumps?
- What?

961
01:37:43,614 --> 01:37:46,698
- You said ''beumps''?
- Yes, yes.

962
01:37:46,784 --> 01:37:50,864
- Have you ever had your beumps read?
- I don't think so.

963
01:37:50,955 --> 01:37:55,534
I would guess that your beumps
would make excellent reading.

964
01:37:55,627 --> 01:37:59,459
Would you mind
if I read your beumps someday?

965
01:38:18,192 --> 01:38:21,312
