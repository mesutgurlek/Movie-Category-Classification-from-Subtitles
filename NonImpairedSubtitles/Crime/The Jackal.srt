1
00:01:59,619 --> 00:02:04,624
Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall.

2
00:02:31,193 --> 00:02:35,655
...bringing to an end the Soviet empire
and its 70-year experiment in communism.

3
00:02:35,739 --> 00:02:38,784
Yet while jubilation
at the prospect of freedom...

4
00:02:43,205 --> 00:02:47,626
The Russian mafia has evolved into
a world-class organized crime network...

5
00:02:47,709 --> 00:02:51,713
...with profits in billions,
including substantial US operations.

6
00:03:01,681 --> 00:03:06,186
...announcing the unprecedented opening
of an FBI legal attache...

7
00:03:06,853 --> 00:03:11,650
...along with the first-ever joint US
and Russian law enforcement operation.

8
00:04:34,858 --> 00:04:36,777
It's her.

9
00:05:23,907 --> 00:05:26,493
Ghazzi's in the club. He's in position.

10
00:05:26,576 --> 00:05:28,954
Okay. Op's a go. MVD only.

11
00:06:31,767 --> 00:06:36,438
What is this? An American?
Who the fuck are you?

12
00:06:37,147 --> 00:06:39,775
Deputy Director Carter Preston, FBI.

13
00:06:39,858 --> 00:06:41,777
FBI.

14
00:06:41,943 --> 00:06:46,615
You fuck Americans now,
you ugly militia whore.

15
00:06:47,324 --> 00:06:50,494
And, you, go fuck yourself.

16
00:06:50,577 --> 00:06:52,746
This is not Chicago. This is Russia.

17
00:06:52,829 --> 00:06:55,665
So take your bitch
and get the fuck out of here.

18
00:06:55,916 --> 00:06:58,543
Do you think I'm afraid of the MVD?

19
00:07:02,089 --> 00:07:05,759
I swear I will kill you
and your fucking whore mothers.

20
00:07:05,842 --> 00:07:07,302
I repeat, you are advised...

21
00:07:07,385 --> 00:07:11,223
Fuck you, you scar-faced cunt!

22
00:07:11,765 --> 00:07:14,017
- Fuck you!
- All right, that's enough!

23
00:07:51,221 --> 00:07:53,723
It's never easy taking a life.

24
00:07:54,141 --> 00:07:57,686
But you saved one, too. Mine.

25
00:07:59,688 --> 00:08:01,773
Thank you.

26
00:08:11,283 --> 00:08:13,201
We had no warning.

27
00:08:13,368 --> 00:08:15,537
They must have ambushed
our man outside.

28
00:08:16,121 --> 00:08:20,751
Before we knew it, there were militia with
their guns out in every corner of the room.

29
00:08:20,834 --> 00:08:23,170
They just opened fire and killed him.

30
00:08:24,504 --> 00:08:26,631
It happened so fast, it was...

31
00:08:26,715 --> 00:08:28,925
...over before it started.

32
00:08:29,176 --> 00:08:32,262
God, my poor brother.

33
00:08:35,974 --> 00:08:38,477
How many militia did you kill?

34
00:08:40,604 --> 00:08:42,939
Terek, please, we didn't stand a chance.

35
00:08:43,023 --> 00:08:44,941
There were 30 of them...

36
00:08:45,025 --> 00:08:48,695
...plus the Americans.
- Yes, but how many did you kill?

37
00:08:52,574 --> 00:08:54,785
Well, none.

38
00:08:55,368 --> 00:08:57,412
None? Not even one?

39
00:08:58,538 --> 00:09:00,457
Terek, please.

40
00:09:00,999 --> 00:09:02,793
I did what I could.

41
00:09:04,753 --> 00:09:08,340
You did what you could.

42
00:09:08,423 --> 00:09:12,260
You let those militia pigs
and that American scum kill my brother...

43
00:09:12,969 --> 00:09:15,847
...without killing one in return.

44
00:09:16,973 --> 00:09:19,351
Okay, that's what you could do.

45
00:09:20,185 --> 00:09:22,187
Here's what I can do.

46
00:09:31,822 --> 00:09:34,324
I loved this man like a brother.

47
00:09:34,574 --> 00:09:37,202
He was a dear friend and partner to me.

48
00:09:37,911 --> 00:09:40,330
So I took no joy in that.

49
00:09:41,665 --> 00:09:43,667
But just think...

50
00:09:44,167 --> 00:09:46,545
...if I could do this to one I love...

51
00:09:47,337 --> 00:09:50,173
...what could I do to someone I hate?

52
00:09:53,677 --> 00:09:58,056
The American FBI declares war on us?

53
00:10:02,269 --> 00:10:04,438
Then war it is.

54
00:10:05,522 --> 00:10:08,483
Unlike other, less cunning predators...

55
00:10:08,567 --> 00:10:13,572
...the hyena takes no chances,
never attacking unless sure of a kill.

56
00:10:14,531 --> 00:10:19,077
Though a consummate killer,
he is clearly no gentleman.

57
00:10:22,873 --> 00:10:25,459
I apologize for keeping you waiting.

58
00:10:25,542 --> 00:10:28,378
I had some other business to dispose of.

59
00:10:28,462 --> 00:10:30,046
So much wasted time...

60
00:10:30,130 --> 00:10:33,467
...confusing motion with accomplishment.
Another drink?

61
00:10:49,775 --> 00:10:52,068
The MVD killed my brother.

62
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:55,572
For that, I will see they drown in blood.

63
00:10:55,739 --> 00:10:59,951
But to their allies in America,
I wish to send a message.

64
00:11:00,452 --> 00:11:03,080
A very public message.

65
00:11:03,163 --> 00:11:06,541
I want to strike fear
into the marrow of their bones.

66
00:11:09,294 --> 00:11:11,671
Can you kill this person?

67
00:11:14,382 --> 00:11:15,801
Yes.

68
00:11:22,808 --> 00:11:25,310
If I take this job, I'll have to disappear...

69
00:11:25,393 --> 00:11:27,020
...forever.

70
00:11:27,646 --> 00:11:31,149
So if you want me to do this,
you're going to have to pay me.

71
00:11:31,274 --> 00:11:33,068
How much?

72
00:11:33,819 --> 00:11:35,445
American dollars.

73
00:11:35,529 --> 00:11:37,656
All cash, of course.

74
00:11:37,864 --> 00:11:40,283
Half now, half upon completion.

75
00:11:45,247 --> 00:11:47,249
$70 million.

76
00:11:51,962 --> 00:11:53,672
Why not?

77
00:11:53,964 --> 00:11:55,882
Done.

78
00:11:56,299 --> 00:11:58,051
How many people know about this?

79
00:11:58,135 --> 00:12:00,720
- You and I.
- Keep it that way.

80
00:12:01,430 --> 00:12:04,724
Don't refer to our arrangement
by telephone or fax, ever.

81
00:12:05,517 --> 00:12:09,855
You should find a place outside of Russia
to hide until the mission's completed.

82
00:12:09,938 --> 00:12:13,817
If word of this leaks, it'll be my choice
whether to continue or not.

83
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:17,863
Either way, I keep the initial payment.
Agreed?

84
00:12:18,738 --> 00:12:20,657
Okay.

85
00:12:22,701 --> 00:12:26,997
Informants tell us Terek's put bounties
on all MVD and FBI personnel.

86
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:30,834
Deputy Director Preston
and I have special bounties on our lives.

87
00:12:30,917 --> 00:12:33,962
In two weeks,
seven MVD operatives have been killed.

88
00:12:34,045 --> 00:12:37,632
- We know we're getting to him.
- Informants say this is just the start.

89
00:12:37,716 --> 00:12:40,260
Terek's planning something more dramatic.

90
00:12:41,636 --> 00:12:42,846
Eight days ago...

91
00:12:42,929 --> 00:12:46,183
...Terek and his lieutenants
were spotted in the town of Porvoo...

92
00:12:46,266 --> 00:12:48,185
...60 kilometers west of Helsinki.

93
00:12:48,268 --> 00:12:52,773
They're still there, taking the third floor
for themselves and their bodyguards...

94
00:12:52,856 --> 00:12:56,067
...all former SPETSNAZ, nine in all.

95
00:12:56,193 --> 00:12:58,737
Not one's left the building in five days.

96
00:12:58,862 --> 00:13:03,033
Their only contact with the outside
is this man: Victor Politovsky.

97
00:13:03,325 --> 00:13:08,080
He goes to the post office twice a day
for mail which arrives general delivery.

98
00:13:08,163 --> 00:13:11,374
Contact Interpol
and get everything you can on Politovsky.

99
00:13:12,501 --> 00:13:16,671
Terek's men are notoriously hard to
turn out. Should we get the opportunity...

100
00:13:16,755 --> 00:13:21,301
...we must be prepared to conduct
the interrogation with utmost efficiency.

101
00:13:21,384 --> 00:13:24,888
- Good day to you, Mr. Preston.
- Sir.

102
00:13:29,267 --> 00:13:32,312
I don't think
I want to know what that means.

103
00:15:23,590 --> 00:15:26,051
The new lamination's the tricky part.

104
00:15:26,259 --> 00:15:28,595
You got to use ethyl acetone.

105
00:15:28,678 --> 00:15:32,432
Nasty stuff. Gives you liver cancer.

106
00:15:32,808 --> 00:15:35,894
And I use a disk drive
to erase the magnetic strip.

107
00:15:37,813 --> 00:15:40,273
- It's perfect.
- Thank you.

108
00:15:40,357 --> 00:15:42,776
You really do beautiful work.

109
00:15:42,859 --> 00:15:45,946
- Art comes in various guises, doesn't it?
- Yes, it does.

110
00:15:46,071 --> 00:15:48,824
- What do I owe you?
- Right.

111
00:15:49,699 --> 00:15:54,079
Well, I think your balance is about BP375.

112
00:15:54,830 --> 00:15:58,166
- This is BP500.
- Oh, thank you.

113
00:15:58,250 --> 00:16:00,877
- Good luck with the baby.
- Thank you.

114
00:16:00,961 --> 00:16:02,963
See you next time.

115
00:16:27,946 --> 00:16:29,823
How do you want the accounts handled?

116
00:16:29,906 --> 00:16:33,034
Split the deposit equally between
the Macao and Panama accounts.

117
00:16:33,118 --> 00:16:35,537
- And the balance?
- Leave it here in dollars.

118
00:16:35,620 --> 00:16:37,998
I'll need you to open me
a Luxembourg account.

119
00:16:38,081 --> 00:16:42,669
And get me some credit cards. Use
an American bank. I'll send you the names.

120
00:16:42,753 --> 00:16:46,006
I'll overnight the credit cards
to your box in Montreal.

121
00:16:46,423 --> 00:16:49,468
- This also came in the draft.
- Yes.

122
00:16:49,551 --> 00:16:52,220
- I'll need to use your computer, Clive.
- Of course.

123
00:16:52,304 --> 00:16:55,432
- Everything's ready for you.
- Good. Thank you.

124
00:16:58,727 --> 00:17:01,855
Good afternoon. How may we help you?

125
00:17:01,938 --> 00:17:05,817
I'm interested in an intermediate
range system, high cyclic rate.

126
00:17:08,445 --> 00:17:11,990
- Man portable?
- Compact, vehicle-mounted unit.

127
00:17:12,949 --> 00:17:14,242
What caliber?

128
00:17:14,326 --> 00:17:16,787
No smaller than 7.62.

129
00:17:16,870 --> 00:17:18,163
Available:

130
00:17:18,246 --> 00:17:22,959
7.62 millimeter M134 electric Gatling gun.

131
00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:27,380
I prefer non-US equipment,
single-parallel system.

132
00:17:27,798 --> 00:17:28,840
Available:

133
00:17:28,924 --> 00:17:33,095
Yugoslav 20 millimeter 19/55 cannon.

134
00:17:34,304 --> 00:17:35,972
Too heavy.

135
00:17:36,056 --> 00:17:37,265
Available:

136
00:17:37,349 --> 00:17:41,520
Polish ZSU-33 electric, 14.5 millimeter.

137
00:17:41,603 --> 00:17:44,815
Cyclic rate: 1,400 rounds per minute.

138
00:17:46,024 --> 00:17:47,317
Interested.

139
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:51,238
Effective combat range: 3,500 meters.

140
00:17:51,321 --> 00:17:55,367
Muzzle velocity: 1,700 meters per second.

141
00:17:56,410 --> 00:17:57,494
I'll take it.

142
00:17:57,577 --> 00:18:01,331
Cost will be $200,000, US.

143
00:18:02,207 --> 00:18:06,002
Transfer of funds in the usual manner.
Half now, half on delivery...

144
00:18:06,211 --> 00:18:07,754
...to the following address:

145
00:18:07,838 --> 00:18:11,925
Letterham Shipping,
Montreal, Quebec, Canada...

146
00:18:12,008 --> 00:18:14,761
...GIH 876.

147
00:18:15,011 --> 00:18:17,973
Client name: Murdock, Charles C.

148
00:18:27,524 --> 00:18:31,069
"What are they planning?
Why is Terek in Finland?"

149
00:18:31,153 --> 00:18:34,823
"The Americans. Kill. Example. "

150
00:18:35,282 --> 00:18:38,827
"Jackal? What Jackal?
It doesn't make sense. "

151
00:18:39,369 --> 00:18:41,288
"What are they planning?"

152
00:18:43,248 --> 00:18:44,958
"Who are you?"

153
00:18:49,087 --> 00:18:51,047
"You fucking Jackal. "

154
00:18:55,469 --> 00:18:58,346
"Why you hanging around? Revive him. "

155
00:19:00,766 --> 00:19:02,392
Jesus.

156
00:19:04,352 --> 00:19:08,648
Drug-assisted interrogation is
perfectly legal in matters of state security.

157
00:19:08,899 --> 00:19:12,903
Unfortunately, Mr. Politovsky
had an undiagnosed heart condition.

158
00:19:14,362 --> 00:19:17,365
He said, "Jackal"?

159
00:19:18,325 --> 00:19:20,911
Does this mean something to you?

160
00:19:21,203 --> 00:19:24,122
There's supposedly a killer for hire
who uses that name.

161
00:19:24,206 --> 00:19:26,666
Several assassinations
are credited to him...

162
00:19:26,750 --> 00:19:30,212
...but we've never been able to prove
if he even exists.

163
00:19:43,475 --> 00:19:45,894
From time to time, he was KGB asset.

164
00:19:46,561 --> 00:19:49,397
- Do you have a name?
- No name.

165
00:19:49,773 --> 00:19:54,194
Payments were made to the contracting
organization or a Hong Kong bank account.

166
00:19:55,028 --> 00:19:57,322
No KGB member has ever seen him.

167
00:19:57,405 --> 00:19:59,991
Do we know if he ever operated in the US?

168
00:20:00,450 --> 00:20:02,661
No. But...

169
00:20:04,621 --> 00:20:07,791
...Politovsky's briefcase
contained biographical material...

170
00:20:07,874 --> 00:20:10,669
...on your Donald Brown,
Director of the FBI.

171
00:20:11,211 --> 00:20:14,423
Jesus Christ.
This guy's going for the gold, huh?

172
00:20:14,506 --> 00:20:16,925
- Get him on the phone for me.
- Yes, sir.

173
00:20:42,784 --> 00:20:45,245
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

174
00:20:45,328 --> 00:20:48,415
- Purpose of your visit to Canada?
- Steelhead.

175
00:20:50,584 --> 00:20:52,377
Fishing.

176
00:20:54,045 --> 00:20:56,256
Enjoy your stay, Mr. Hayslip.

177
00:20:56,339 --> 00:20:58,592
Thank you. I will.

178
00:21:02,012 --> 00:21:04,222
I'll give you a good deal on this minivan.

179
00:21:04,306 --> 00:21:06,141
It's brand-new. It's fully loaded.

180
00:21:06,224 --> 00:21:08,435
We've even got a six-disk CD changer.

181
00:21:08,518 --> 00:21:11,354
I'll need your driver's license
and credit card.

182
00:21:11,438 --> 00:21:13,273
I'll check this with the manager.

183
00:21:13,356 --> 00:21:16,318
- Everything should be okay, Mr. Murdock.
- Make it Charlie.

184
00:21:16,401 --> 00:21:19,613
- All right, Charlie. See you in a second.
- Take your time.

185
00:22:28,515 --> 00:22:31,560
I want this op close-hold, no publicity.

186
00:22:32,269 --> 00:22:35,814
Put a working group together:
State, CIA, Secret Service...

187
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:38,150
...Russian Embassy.

188
00:22:38,233 --> 00:22:42,404
They'll have daily progress reports,
9:00 p. m. Every evening, this office.

189
00:22:43,530 --> 00:22:45,657
Major Koslova, anything else?

190
00:22:45,741 --> 00:22:50,746
Since 1983, KGB provided funding
for five direct-action missions:

191
00:22:51,037 --> 00:22:53,957
One bombing and four assassinations
by gunshot.

192
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:56,209
The Jackal was the operative used.

193
00:22:56,835 --> 00:22:59,296
Not giving me much to work with, Preston.

194
00:22:59,379 --> 00:23:01,047
We don't have much, sir.

195
00:23:01,131 --> 00:23:03,842
Major Koslova's informers can't finger him.

196
00:23:04,217 --> 00:23:06,845
They don't know who he is,
CIA can't track him.

197
00:23:06,928 --> 00:23:08,597
Then what?

198
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:11,475
Using KGB files,
I've identified six operatives...

199
00:23:11,558 --> 00:23:13,685
...we believe to have actually seen him.

200
00:23:13,769 --> 00:23:17,773
Four are dead, one in Libya, but the last
is believed to be in the United States.

201
00:23:17,856 --> 00:23:21,318
A Basque separatist
name Isabella Celia Zancona.

202
00:23:21,401 --> 00:23:23,612
She might know what he looks like.

203
00:23:23,695 --> 00:23:27,449
- But we have no idea of her whereabouts.
- Someone must.

204
00:23:28,158 --> 00:23:30,952
Interpol says that in the '80s
she was involved with...

205
00:23:31,036 --> 00:23:33,830
...Declan Joseph Mulqueen,
an IRA sharpshooter.

206
00:23:33,914 --> 00:23:38,502
He burned out. They decided to get him
out of Ireland, shipped him here.

207
00:23:38,585 --> 00:23:42,798
In '89, he picked up twice 25 years
for some old weapons trafficking charges.

208
00:23:42,881 --> 00:23:46,718
He's serving time at a maximum-security
state pen in Massachusetts.

209
00:23:46,802 --> 00:23:51,056
Say he does know where she is.
What makes you think he'll talk to you?

210
00:23:51,181 --> 00:23:54,518
I'm hoping he'll cooperate
for a reduced sentence.

211
00:23:54,601 --> 00:23:58,480
Don't promise too much.
After all, he's a terrorist.

212
00:24:15,497 --> 00:24:17,874
You got some visitors, Mulqueen.

213
00:24:24,923 --> 00:24:28,093
What do you want with Isabella?
She's done nothing here.

214
00:24:28,176 --> 00:24:30,595
She entered the country illegally.

215
00:24:33,056 --> 00:24:38,311
What? The FBI's sending
deputy directors out after illegal aliens?

216
00:24:40,355 --> 00:24:43,108
Give over, Preston.
Who you really looking for?

217
00:24:43,275 --> 00:24:46,611
A pro. Calls himself "The Jackal. "

218
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:50,115
That fellow.

219
00:24:51,575 --> 00:24:53,201
The mystery man.

220
00:24:54,119 --> 00:24:57,247
We think she may be able
to help us find him.

221
00:24:57,372 --> 00:24:59,624
If so, we'll arrange a pardon for her...

222
00:24:59,708 --> 00:25:02,127
...signed by the President of the US.

223
00:25:02,210 --> 00:25:05,922
And guarantee no extradition. We'd also
guarantee the Spanish government...

224
00:25:06,006 --> 00:25:09,801
...will never know her whereabouts.
- They don't know now, do they?

225
00:25:10,302 --> 00:25:12,012
And neither do you.

226
00:25:12,095 --> 00:25:14,014
Let's keep it that way.

227
00:25:22,647 --> 00:25:25,484
Would it matter that you might be
saving a human life?

228
00:25:25,567 --> 00:25:29,070
And whose human life
would be important enough for all this?

229
00:25:29,279 --> 00:25:32,365
Mr. Donald Brown, Director of the FBI.

230
00:25:34,743 --> 00:25:36,620
Wouldn't that be droll?

231
00:25:39,122 --> 00:25:42,209
We know that gang elements
in this prison want you dead.

232
00:25:42,292 --> 00:25:45,045
The entire government
wants me dead, mister.

233
00:25:45,128 --> 00:25:48,673
- Yet here I am.
- All right, smart ass, let's cut the bullshit.

234
00:25:49,007 --> 00:25:52,761
You cooperate and we'll get you
transferred to a minimum-security facility.

235
00:25:52,844 --> 00:25:54,471
That's our deal.

236
00:25:54,554 --> 00:25:57,849
And that's your only chance
to walk out of this place in one piece.

237
00:25:57,933 --> 00:26:00,977
That's a one-time offer.
Now take it or leave it.

238
00:26:01,394 --> 00:26:04,314
Stuff it then,
as many fucking times as you like.

239
00:26:04,731 --> 00:26:07,317
Pardon the language. I've been in prison.

240
00:26:20,372 --> 00:26:23,750
All right, what will it take
for you to help us?

241
00:26:25,836 --> 00:26:29,297
First, I'd have to be convinced
Isabella would be kept safe.

242
00:26:29,423 --> 00:26:31,007
Done.

243
00:26:31,842 --> 00:26:33,427
Then you'd have to let me go.

244
00:26:33,510 --> 00:26:35,929
Back to Ireland, a free man.

245
00:26:36,346 --> 00:26:38,473
Out of the question.

246
00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:43,728
Besides gunrunning, you're a known killer
of British government personnel.

247
00:26:43,812 --> 00:26:46,356
And all the women
and children you've blown up.

248
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:49,651
It's not my war. I was never a bomber.

249
00:26:49,734 --> 00:26:52,737
I don't see the distinction.
You still took human lives.

250
00:26:52,821 --> 00:26:56,700
The distinction is I killed in a war.
Now I want to go home. Simple as that.

251
00:26:56,783 --> 00:26:58,118
Simple for you, perhaps.

252
00:26:58,201 --> 00:27:01,455
Even in Russia, soldiers go home
when the treaty's signed, nyet?

253
00:27:01,538 --> 00:27:04,291
That's not gonna happen. Sorry.

254
00:27:06,877 --> 00:27:09,129
All right, just the chance then.

255
00:27:10,672 --> 00:27:13,133
Your best efforts to get me free.

256
00:27:13,884 --> 00:27:15,969
I'll settle for your word on it.

257
00:27:17,763 --> 00:27:19,848
Sorry.

258
00:27:23,059 --> 00:27:25,687
So the Jackal's after your director, is he?

259
00:27:25,979 --> 00:27:28,148
Tell him to get his affairs in order...

260
00:27:28,231 --> 00:27:29,983
...because nobody can save him now.

261
00:27:30,066 --> 00:27:33,528
Nobody except me. Because I met him.

262
00:27:37,908 --> 00:27:40,118
Yeah, didn't I mention it?

263
00:27:52,089 --> 00:27:56,009
I can identify him by his face,
given the opportunity...

264
00:27:56,301 --> 00:27:58,470
...but more importantly, by his methods.

265
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:03,433
So you can leave Isabella out of this.

266
00:28:04,101 --> 00:28:05,977
Did you work with him?

267
00:28:06,061 --> 00:28:08,688
With him? No. No way.

268
00:28:11,399 --> 00:28:13,652
Do you have a problem with this man?

269
00:28:15,695 --> 00:28:18,115
That's between him and me.

270
00:28:23,495 --> 00:28:26,915
Isabella Zancona
is the only confirmed contact we have...

271
00:28:26,998 --> 00:28:29,167
...and we will find her.

272
00:28:29,418 --> 00:28:32,045
With or without your help.

273
00:28:32,337 --> 00:28:34,214
Okay.

274
00:28:36,633 --> 00:28:39,719
I want three things.
One: Get me out of here.

275
00:28:39,845 --> 00:28:43,849
- I'm no use to you sitting here on my ass.
- What's to keep you from taking off?

276
00:28:43,932 --> 00:28:45,851
Nothing.

277
00:28:46,184 --> 00:28:48,103
Except I give you my word.

278
00:28:49,563 --> 00:28:52,774
Two: I go with you to meet Isabella.

279
00:28:53,525 --> 00:28:55,152
Why?

280
00:28:55,986 --> 00:28:58,113
I want to see her, is all.

281
00:29:01,658 --> 00:29:03,785
And the third thing?

282
00:29:05,078 --> 00:29:07,080
A decent razor.

283
00:29:11,460 --> 00:29:13,170
Here's how it'll go, Mulqueen.

284
00:29:13,253 --> 00:29:16,798
You will be searched on a random
schedule. If we turn up a paper clip...

285
00:29:16,882 --> 00:29:21,094
...that hasn't been authorized, I'll send
you back. Same for using the phone.

286
00:29:21,178 --> 00:29:24,431
- What? You don't trust me?
- As far as I can throw you.

287
00:29:24,514 --> 00:29:26,475
But I have little choice.

288
00:29:26,558 --> 00:29:29,603
If you've got any thoughts
about an IRA snatch...

289
00:29:29,728 --> 00:29:31,813
...we'll shoot to kill, them and you.

290
00:29:31,897 --> 00:29:34,900
And not necessarily in that order.
Understand?

291
00:29:34,983 --> 00:29:36,902
I heard you.

292
00:29:37,235 --> 00:29:39,988
Go along and we'll get along.

293
00:29:49,623 --> 00:29:51,958
I'm gonna keep a real good eye on you.

294
00:29:56,671 --> 00:29:58,632
Miss Koslova, is it?

295
00:30:05,847 --> 00:30:08,058
What would your first name be then?

296
00:30:08,934 --> 00:30:10,560
Major.

297
00:30:11,311 --> 00:30:13,563
Major Koslova.

298
00:30:20,570 --> 00:30:22,739
A wee bit rusty, that's all.

299
00:30:38,588 --> 00:30:41,883
Subassembly of titanium,
as light as the stresses will allow.

300
00:30:42,884 --> 00:30:45,303
The arm's got to traverse 270 degrees.

301
00:30:45,387 --> 00:30:48,223
Feed and drive mechanisms
run on 210 amp servos.

302
00:30:48,306 --> 00:30:51,184
The whole thing's has to run off 12-volt DC.

303
00:30:51,852 --> 00:30:54,062
Yeah, it's a car battery. That's cool.

304
00:30:54,146 --> 00:30:58,066
- How much weight is the arm supporting?
- Fifty-five kilograms.

305
00:30:58,233 --> 00:31:01,278
It's a big fucker, yeah?

306
00:31:01,528 --> 00:31:03,280
Hey, you want one?

307
00:31:03,363 --> 00:31:04,781
No.

308
00:31:05,824 --> 00:31:08,243
I'm gonna want this in eight days.

309
00:31:08,535 --> 00:31:10,120
I can do that.

310
00:31:11,997 --> 00:31:13,582
How much?

311
00:31:15,709 --> 00:31:18,044
Well, the titanium's gonna be a problem.

312
00:31:18,128 --> 00:31:22,299
It's a listed material up here.
It's gonna take time, a little more money.

313
00:31:23,008 --> 00:31:24,843
$50,000?

314
00:31:28,555 --> 00:31:32,684
I mean, like, $40,000.

315
00:31:35,645 --> 00:31:38,064
All right. Half now, half on delivery.

316
00:31:39,524 --> 00:31:42,527
This sucker's definitely
gonna kick some ass, yeah?

317
00:31:45,155 --> 00:31:46,740
Get this straight.

318
00:31:46,948 --> 00:31:50,660
When you finish this unit, you'll turn over
the plans and scrap material.

319
00:31:50,744 --> 00:31:54,706
You'll forget about Charlie Murdock
and the tech specs on these plans.

320
00:31:55,415 --> 00:31:57,584
Shit, man, I'm cool.

321
00:31:57,667 --> 00:31:59,628
Relax.

322
00:32:01,755 --> 00:32:03,507
All right.

323
00:32:33,203 --> 00:32:34,955
Are you nervous?

324
00:32:37,999 --> 00:32:41,420
Eight years. That's a lifetime, isn't it?

325
00:32:43,630 --> 00:32:45,298
Hello.

326
00:32:45,882 --> 00:32:47,884
- Mr. Decker, is it?
- Yes.

327
00:32:47,968 --> 00:32:50,887
Hello there. I'm Declan Mulqueen.

328
00:32:51,054 --> 00:32:54,307
This is Major Koslova.

329
00:32:54,391 --> 00:32:56,393
- How do you do?
- Hi.

330
00:32:56,852 --> 00:32:58,937
We'd like to speak to your wife.

331
00:33:00,564 --> 00:33:02,983
Someone to see you.

332
00:33:41,146 --> 00:33:43,523
I'll take the kids out back.

333
00:33:48,361 --> 00:33:50,572
My beautiful Irish...

334
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:06,338
They let me out to ask you something.

335
00:34:07,964 --> 00:34:12,010
Sir, I was thinking maybe we could
use the Zancona woman as insurance...

336
00:34:12,302 --> 00:34:14,846
...in case Mulqueen gets happy feet.
- Listen...

337
00:34:14,930 --> 00:34:17,057
...however he plays it, we play it straight.

338
00:34:17,140 --> 00:34:20,477
Isabella Zancona's involvement
remains classified.

339
00:34:20,936 --> 00:34:23,313
That means nothing in the report.

340
00:34:23,522 --> 00:34:26,274
No name, no location, nothing. Got it?

341
00:34:26,733 --> 00:34:28,068
Yes, sir.

342
00:34:32,656 --> 00:34:35,325
I never knew his name,
but he was definitely American.

343
00:34:35,409 --> 00:34:37,869
He had some kind
of special military training...

344
00:34:37,953 --> 00:34:40,997
...where he learned Spanish,
in El Salvador, I think.

345
00:34:41,289 --> 00:34:43,667
I didn't like talking to him.

346
00:34:43,750 --> 00:34:46,837
I suppose we were all dangerous people...

347
00:34:47,170 --> 00:34:49,548
...but he was different.

348
00:34:49,714 --> 00:34:53,385
Declan was fire, all passion.
He had a cause.

349
00:34:53,552 --> 00:34:57,139
This man was ice. No feeling, nothing.

350
00:34:57,722 --> 00:35:00,892
Okay. Thank you, Mrs. Decker.
You've been very helpful.

351
00:35:01,435 --> 00:35:06,189
It's best if you keep our conversation
confidential, even from your husband.

352
00:35:07,274 --> 00:35:09,151
Don't worry about George.

353
00:35:09,526 --> 00:35:13,029
He doesn't know anything
about my past and he doesn't want to.

354
00:35:13,113 --> 00:35:16,366
All he needs to know is that I love him.

355
00:35:19,786 --> 00:35:21,246
I see.

356
00:35:22,706 --> 00:35:24,541
I thank you again.

357
00:35:25,584 --> 00:35:27,544
I'll wait for you in the car.

358
00:35:35,469 --> 00:35:38,847
This opens a locker
at Norfolk Greyhound Terminal.

359
00:35:39,306 --> 00:35:43,059
Inside is a clean passport and $10,000 cash.

360
00:35:43,518 --> 00:35:46,897
Your friends left it with me
in case you ever showed up.

361
00:35:47,481 --> 00:35:50,734
Take it and go back to Ireland.

362
00:35:51,526 --> 00:35:53,028
I can't.

363
00:35:53,487 --> 00:35:55,155
What?

364
00:35:56,573 --> 00:35:58,825
You gave your word?

365
00:36:00,952 --> 00:36:02,662
Go now.

366
00:36:02,746 --> 00:36:06,041
Once he kills whoever he's after,
they'll send you back to prison.

367
00:36:06,124 --> 00:36:08,627
When I believe that, I'll use the key.

368
00:36:22,224 --> 00:36:24,142
Are you happy at least?

369
00:36:24,226 --> 00:36:27,312
Yes. I love my children.

370
00:36:28,855 --> 00:36:32,275
And my husband, in my way, I mean.

371
00:36:41,910 --> 00:36:46,415
Some nights I can close my eyes
and sleep...

372
00:36:49,126 --> 00:36:51,795
...and no dead faces come to wake me.

373
00:36:52,295 --> 00:36:54,714
That's more than I ever had.

374
00:36:57,426 --> 00:37:00,095
You wouldn't have me give that up,
would you?

375
00:37:04,099 --> 00:37:06,518
Give me some credit, will you?

376
00:37:39,384 --> 00:37:41,720
She's Basque, isn't she?

377
00:37:43,263 --> 00:37:44,681
Aye.

378
00:37:45,265 --> 00:37:47,809
They say Basques live by the vendetta.

379
00:37:48,435 --> 00:37:50,937
If they hate someone, it's to the death.

380
00:37:51,021 --> 00:37:53,398
It's the same way when they love.

381
00:37:56,735 --> 00:37:59,154
My first name is Valentina.

382
00:38:05,827 --> 00:38:07,871
You have family in Russia?

383
00:38:07,954 --> 00:38:10,999
My parents. My brother, in the navy.

384
00:38:11,083 --> 00:38:13,168
Husband? Kids?

385
00:38:13,585 --> 00:38:16,630
No. I have not found the time.

386
00:38:20,842 --> 00:38:24,763
In truth, it's never been a conflict for me.

387
00:38:24,971 --> 00:38:28,016
This is not a quality
a man looks for in a woman.

388
00:38:36,149 --> 00:38:37,442
By the way...

389
00:38:37,526 --> 00:38:40,237
...whatever Isabella gave you after I left...

390
00:38:40,487 --> 00:38:44,533
...I trust you won't use it
until after our business is concluded.

391
00:38:45,992 --> 00:38:47,953
Don't miss a thing, do you?

392
00:38:48,036 --> 00:38:50,080
No, Mr. Mulqueen.

393
00:38:50,831 --> 00:38:52,707
I see everything.

394
00:39:02,843 --> 00:39:06,012
Maybe we should start
by canceling your public appearances.

395
00:39:06,096 --> 00:39:08,890
No, I don't think that's necessary.
I mean, not yet.

396
00:39:08,974 --> 00:39:12,519
This fellow's gonna need to
make preparations. He'll need time.

397
00:39:12,602 --> 00:39:15,939
- How tight are the borders?
- Mexico and Canada have...

398
00:39:16,940 --> 00:39:20,694
Mr. Mulqueen?
Something you'd like to share?

399
00:39:21,862 --> 00:39:24,364
He'll likely be using four false identities.

400
00:39:24,448 --> 00:39:27,701
Three will be on him, and one
in reserve at a drop box somewhere.

401
00:39:27,784 --> 00:39:30,871
- That's the way he used to operate.
- What matter if he has 40?

402
00:39:30,954 --> 00:39:35,208
It's still one man. Might we not
be creating a storm in a tea cup?

403
00:39:35,292 --> 00:39:38,128
Exactly. I agree with you 100 percent.

404
00:39:39,212 --> 00:39:41,423
Director Bolitonov.

405
00:39:41,590 --> 00:39:45,343
Terek has always made
doing his own killing a point of honor.

406
00:39:45,552 --> 00:39:47,763
Usually very bloody and very public.

407
00:39:47,846 --> 00:39:49,890
A statement, if you will.

408
00:39:50,182 --> 00:39:52,768
So, if he's hired an outsider...

409
00:39:52,934 --> 00:39:56,104
...obviously, this is something
he takes very seriously.

410
00:39:56,188 --> 00:39:58,523
Until this Jackal is captured or killed...

411
00:39:58,607 --> 00:40:00,776
...I don't think we can afford to do any less.

412
00:40:00,859 --> 00:40:04,279
Come on. Let's get real here. It's one guy.

413
00:40:04,404 --> 00:40:07,199
It's just one guy. Bolitonov's right.

414
00:40:07,449 --> 00:40:10,452
With the assets in this room,
the guy's as good as got.

415
00:40:10,535 --> 00:40:12,871
That's if he doesn't blow it first...

416
00:40:12,954 --> 00:40:17,125
...like a lot of these clowns.
Remember that guy? What was his name?

417
00:40:18,627 --> 00:40:20,420
What's that, Mr. Mulqueen?

418
00:40:21,421 --> 00:40:24,633
I'm sorry, Mr. Brown,
but this man is no clown.

419
00:40:24,841 --> 00:40:27,260
He knows all your moves, back to front.

420
00:40:28,011 --> 00:40:30,430
Right now, you got a name.
That's all you got.

421
00:40:30,514 --> 00:40:33,850
The Jackal's got a target: You.
He's got a timetable.

422
00:40:33,934 --> 00:40:37,979
As to making mistakes, he's spent 20 years
in a trade that doesn't forgive error.

423
00:40:38,063 --> 00:40:40,190
And he's prevailed.

424
00:40:41,233 --> 00:40:43,819
You think he's the one
who is up against us?

425
00:40:43,944 --> 00:40:45,862
It's the other way around.

426
00:41:46,757 --> 00:41:48,675
- Hi.
- Hi.

427
00:41:50,302 --> 00:41:53,597
- Can I buy you a drink?
- Yeah.

428
00:42:06,693 --> 00:42:09,029
I think you should come home with me.

429
00:42:10,781 --> 00:42:12,449
I'd love to...

430
00:42:13,408 --> 00:42:15,327
...but I can't.

431
00:42:15,494 --> 00:42:17,329
I have to go back to Atlanta...

432
00:42:17,412 --> 00:42:20,165
...to finalize my very messy divorce.

433
00:42:22,626 --> 00:42:24,419
Does she know?

434
00:42:24,503 --> 00:42:26,421
She does now.

435
00:42:29,758 --> 00:42:31,676
So how am I gonna see you again?

436
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:34,262
You could give me one of your cards.

437
00:42:40,852 --> 00:42:42,771
You're not gonna call.

438
00:42:42,938 --> 00:42:44,689
Douglas.

439
00:42:47,025 --> 00:42:50,570
You just have to have
a little faith in people, that's all.

440
00:42:50,904 --> 00:42:52,864
Like I do.

441
00:44:05,937 --> 00:44:07,731
Open your shirt.

442
00:44:10,150 --> 00:44:12,611
- Easy now. Easy.
- Now!

443
00:44:15,822 --> 00:44:17,616
Easy.

444
00:44:18,158 --> 00:44:19,951
Open your shirt.

445
00:44:20,035 --> 00:44:21,828
Easy now.

446
00:44:28,919 --> 00:44:31,671
Souvenirs of British hospitality.

447
00:44:37,344 --> 00:44:39,221
I apologize.

448
00:44:42,724 --> 00:44:43,975
No problem.

449
00:44:44,059 --> 00:44:48,480
Oslo Travel came up with a James William
Hayslip who flew from Toronto...

450
00:44:48,563 --> 00:44:51,316
...August 25, two days before
the meeting with Terek.

451
00:44:51,400 --> 00:44:55,821
We checked the Social Security number
on his passport, and guess what?

452
00:44:57,030 --> 00:45:01,910
It belongs to an inmate committed to a
mental institution in Virginia 12 years ago.

453
00:45:03,161 --> 00:45:05,622
Now, Canadian Travel says he flew...

454
00:45:05,705 --> 00:45:09,042
...to Montreal nine days ago.

455
00:45:56,715 --> 00:45:57,758
Hello?

456
00:45:59,176 --> 00:46:00,218
Hello?

457
00:46:00,302 --> 00:46:02,554
- Yeah?
- Yeah, Charlie Murdock.

458
00:46:02,804 --> 00:46:05,849
Picking up a delivery, eh?

459
00:46:06,850 --> 00:46:08,769
Invoice.

460
00:46:09,060 --> 00:46:10,854
Yes.

461
00:46:10,937 --> 00:46:13,648
- It's a hot one, eh?
- You can say that again.

462
00:47:16,503 --> 00:47:19,923
Hi. I need to use one of your computers.

463
00:47:20,715 --> 00:47:22,634
Sure. Any one.

464
00:47:27,222 --> 00:47:29,224
Can I get on line with this?

465
00:47:29,307 --> 00:47:31,226
Yeah, sure.

466
00:50:17,225 --> 00:50:19,436
Go check upstairs.

467
00:51:50,444 --> 00:51:52,362
Thank you.

468
00:51:52,779 --> 00:51:54,781
Hayslip's disappeared.

469
00:51:54,865 --> 00:51:58,493
Border Patrol has the passport photo,
but nothing's shown up yet.

470
00:51:58,577 --> 00:52:02,164
- He's moved on. I told you.
- One moment.

471
00:52:02,414 --> 00:52:05,250
The only place we're sure
he's been is Montreal.

472
00:52:05,500 --> 00:52:08,962
What if he started using
the next identity there?

473
00:52:09,463 --> 00:52:10,964
I'm not following you.

474
00:52:11,047 --> 00:52:13,925
Hayslip disappeared,
that doesn't mean the Jackal did.

475
00:52:14,009 --> 00:52:16,052
Perhaps something has happened.

476
00:52:17,554 --> 00:52:21,683
Witherspoon, have the Montreal police
check their logs for the last 48 hours.

477
00:52:21,767 --> 00:52:24,644
If he's on to the next name,
it's because it's in the plan.

478
00:52:24,728 --> 00:52:27,022
- A man like this doesn't make mistakes.
- No?

479
00:52:27,105 --> 00:52:29,691
They always make one, somewhere.

480
00:52:29,941 --> 00:52:32,277
Isn't that how you were caught?

481
00:52:43,705 --> 00:52:45,749
What's her story, then?

482
00:52:46,458 --> 00:52:48,335
Major Koslova...

483
00:52:48,877 --> 00:52:52,130
...ends the debate about
women in combat, as far as I'm concerned.

484
00:52:52,214 --> 00:52:53,632
How's that?

485
00:52:54,591 --> 00:52:57,803
When she saved my life
and took out Terek's brother...

486
00:52:58,386 --> 00:53:02,724
...she did it knowing she'd be drawing
a death sentence down on her own neck.

487
00:53:02,849 --> 00:53:07,562
But when we offered to set her up
someplace else when this is over...

488
00:53:07,646 --> 00:53:10,023
...you know what she said?

489
00:53:10,774 --> 00:53:13,693
"The good guys don't hide. "

490
00:53:16,571 --> 00:53:18,532
Fierce woman.

491
00:53:18,698 --> 00:53:22,160
In that country, under that system...

492
00:53:23,245 --> 00:53:25,205
Staggering.

493
00:53:28,542 --> 00:53:31,711
Oh, shit, you know what?
I couldn't get titanium.

494
00:53:31,795 --> 00:53:34,965
So, I had a friend mold the base
out of carbon fiber instead.

495
00:53:35,048 --> 00:53:38,135
Came in 23 kilos
under the weight you asked for.

496
00:53:38,218 --> 00:53:40,470
- Is that cool?
- Yeah, that's great.

497
00:53:41,096 --> 00:53:45,100
I'm still gonna want the plans, the mold
and the scrap material. Remember?

498
00:53:45,183 --> 00:53:47,519
Yeah.

499
00:53:49,146 --> 00:53:52,065
- Maybe we ought to talk about that.
- Oh?

500
00:53:56,570 --> 00:53:59,823
This rig, I figure it's to support
something pretty heavy, right?

501
00:54:00,240 --> 00:54:03,910
Like a Gatling gun, maybe?

502
00:54:04,828 --> 00:54:07,539
Or a 20-millimeter cannon?

503
00:54:07,622 --> 00:54:09,916
You must be shooting
at something pretty big.

504
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:11,960
Armored car, maybe?

505
00:54:13,170 --> 00:54:14,629
Bank vault?

506
00:54:14,713 --> 00:54:18,967
I don't know. You could be shooting
a fucking airliner for all I know.

507
00:54:19,176 --> 00:54:21,303
But the point is...

508
00:54:21,720 --> 00:54:25,348
...a job like this
can attract a lot of attention.

509
00:54:27,058 --> 00:54:28,727
I don't want any attention.

510
00:54:28,810 --> 00:54:31,354
Right, right. That's why I'm saying...

511
00:54:31,813 --> 00:54:35,025
...I think the plans
and mold are worth a little bonus.

512
00:54:36,359 --> 00:54:38,445
- How much?
- I don't know.

513
00:54:39,821 --> 00:54:41,615
$100,000?

514
00:54:43,950 --> 00:54:48,205
Come on, man. You know it's worth it.
You got a serious piece of equipment.

515
00:54:57,589 --> 00:54:59,591
All right.

516
00:55:00,383 --> 00:55:02,427
I'll get you $50,000 tomorrow.

517
00:55:03,095 --> 00:55:07,057
I'm gonna need a place to test this.
Someplace that won't draw any attention.

518
00:55:07,140 --> 00:55:10,602
We got a place like that.
We got a place just like that.

519
00:55:26,660 --> 00:55:31,081
Target's in place.
Man, I should have brought some beer.

520
00:55:36,420 --> 00:55:39,798
Motherfuckin' motherfucker.

521
00:55:40,715 --> 00:55:44,719
That motherfucker is state of the art!

522
00:55:45,345 --> 00:55:49,850
I knew it was gonna be big. I didn't know
it was gonna be the prototype cannon.

523
00:55:50,058 --> 00:55:52,644
It's a fucking mole.

524
00:55:54,104 --> 00:55:57,274
- Some hairy-looking rounds.
- Made from depleted uranium.

525
00:55:57,357 --> 00:55:59,109
It'll go through anything.

526
00:55:59,192 --> 00:56:01,445
Once they get inside, they just spall.

527
00:56:01,528 --> 00:56:03,655
Hell, yeah. They spall?

528
00:56:04,239 --> 00:56:06,908
They get in there, and they just...

529
00:56:07,784 --> 00:56:08,994
That rocks.

530
00:56:09,077 --> 00:56:11,747
- Look at the lens on that thing.
- Don't touch that.

531
00:56:11,830 --> 00:56:14,750
It's got, like, a 2,000-mile zoom lens.

532
00:56:15,333 --> 00:56:17,169
That thing is kick-ass.

533
00:56:17,669 --> 00:56:20,213
Dude, is this thing a prototype, or what?

534
00:56:20,672 --> 00:56:23,884
I bet you it cost you a shitload.
That rocks.

535
00:56:25,051 --> 00:56:26,511
Man, you rock.

536
00:56:26,595 --> 00:56:28,805
Do you know what I'm saying?

537
00:56:28,889 --> 00:56:31,141
Rock!

538
00:56:33,351 --> 00:56:35,562
Fucking thing kicks ass.

539
00:56:48,408 --> 00:56:50,952
Bring on the spall, baby.

540
00:56:51,495 --> 00:56:53,914
- I can't wait to see the fuck...
- Lamont.

541
00:56:54,956 --> 00:56:56,708
Close your mouth.

542
00:57:09,888 --> 00:57:12,182
Smooth action, yeah?

543
00:57:33,203 --> 00:57:34,830
Ready?

544
00:57:41,002 --> 00:57:44,172
Yeah! Spall!

545
00:57:51,513 --> 00:57:52,931
Well, at least...

546
00:57:53,723 --> 00:57:56,351
...it took out the target.
- No, it's off...

547
00:57:56,893 --> 00:57:58,895
...by at least three millimeters.

548
00:57:58,979 --> 00:58:02,065
No, dude. That's precision craftsmanship.

549
00:58:02,315 --> 00:58:05,068
- It isn't off by three millimeters.
- So, Lamont...

550
00:58:06,653 --> 00:58:09,656
...tell me how you sight
in this thing automatically.

551
00:58:09,740 --> 00:58:13,326
Punch in the windage and
the elevation you want and hit enter.

552
00:58:13,785 --> 00:58:17,748
- So you just kind of guestimate it, huh?
- Basically guestimation.

553
00:58:20,292 --> 00:58:21,960
And hit enter.

554
00:58:27,758 --> 00:58:29,676
I give up!

555
00:58:31,511 --> 00:58:33,930
- I guess the automatic sighting works.
- Yeah.

556
00:58:34,014 --> 00:58:37,434
- I thought I was about to sprawl.
- Well, Lamont...

557
00:58:37,517 --> 00:58:40,520
...gonna have to speed-test it now.
- Speed test.

558
00:58:41,188 --> 00:58:43,356
So, run.

559
00:58:48,904 --> 00:58:50,781
What do you mean?

560
00:58:51,823 --> 00:58:55,077
I mean run, now.

561
00:59:10,258 --> 00:59:12,177
Run to your right!

562
00:59:40,914 --> 00:59:42,916
Get up!

563
00:59:45,419 --> 00:59:48,088
All right, good! Stop there!

564
00:59:49,589 --> 00:59:51,508
Just stop there!

565
00:59:51,800 --> 00:59:53,760
Turn around!

566
00:59:54,803 --> 00:59:57,097
Hold out that pack of cigarettes!

567
01:00:00,684 --> 01:00:02,811
Don't be afraid!

568
01:00:08,692 --> 01:00:10,777
Stand very still!

569
01:00:21,037 --> 01:00:22,998
Stand still!

570
01:00:39,222 --> 01:00:41,475
I told you it was off.

571
01:00:44,019 --> 01:00:46,563
Move over by the car!

572
01:00:47,147 --> 01:00:49,816
Quick, before you pass out!

573
01:01:42,953 --> 01:01:45,831
Here we go, sir. Major. Mac.

574
01:01:46,248 --> 01:01:50,710
Eleven days ago, Charles C. Murdock
bought himself a new Dodge minivan.

575
01:01:52,379 --> 01:01:54,714
That was a big surprise to Mr. Murdock...

576
01:01:54,798 --> 01:01:59,052
...whose passport and wallet were stolen
16 days ago at the Helsinki airport.

577
01:01:59,136 --> 01:02:00,512
Anything from the border?

578
01:02:00,595 --> 01:02:03,515
We sent a description of the van
from here to Manitoba.

579
01:02:03,598 --> 01:02:07,853
I have something. Uphall Station.
It's a small town outside Ottawa.

580
01:02:07,936 --> 01:02:10,856
- I think your man has been there.
- Let's go.

581
01:02:26,830 --> 01:02:29,916
The owner is Ian Lamont, small-time hood.

582
01:02:30,041 --> 01:02:32,377
The coroner has what's left of him
at Broxburn.

583
01:02:32,461 --> 01:02:35,046
We get the idea. Let's get to the shop.

584
01:02:44,723 --> 01:02:47,100
Hello. Think I got something here.

585
01:02:53,398 --> 01:02:55,192
What is it?

586
01:02:55,567 --> 01:02:57,527
This is a remote firing station.

587
01:02:57,611 --> 01:02:59,529
See, it maneuvers a weapon.

588
01:02:59,613 --> 01:03:03,742
The servos run off a remote control,
like a model airplane.

589
01:03:03,867 --> 01:03:06,453
We used to make these things
for mortars or...

590
01:03:06,536 --> 01:03:09,581
...such but nothing like this size.

591
01:03:09,998 --> 01:03:12,000
He needs a van just to move it around.

592
01:03:12,084 --> 01:03:14,503
What would something this size
be used for?

593
01:03:14,586 --> 01:03:17,339
- Antiaircraft?
- No, you can buy a mount for that.

594
01:03:17,422 --> 01:03:20,050
A missile's the best thing for an aircraft.

595
01:03:20,675 --> 01:03:25,055
- No, this is for something else entirely.
- Something with one hell of a range.

596
01:03:25,180 --> 01:03:27,265
Not just the range, though.

597
01:03:27,516 --> 01:03:30,102
See, if it is a gun, it's the cyclic rate.

598
01:03:30,727 --> 01:03:35,065
You can send off a hundred bullets
before the first one ever hits the target.

599
01:03:39,653 --> 01:03:41,947
Good thing about a boat like this
is it sells itself.

600
01:03:42,030 --> 01:03:45,325
It's a hell of a lot of boat for the money.
It's got radar...

601
01:03:45,409 --> 01:03:49,579
...GPS, autopilot, auto-furling.
You can take this baby out by yourself.

602
01:03:51,164 --> 01:03:55,377
This has even got a cellular phone.
You can call your wife if you want to.

603
01:03:56,503 --> 01:03:58,797
So, what do you think?

604
01:03:59,339 --> 01:04:01,508
"Deja Vu. "

605
01:04:04,386 --> 01:04:06,346
She's perfect.

606
01:05:50,617 --> 01:05:52,202
- Yes?
- Jackal.

607
01:05:52,285 --> 01:05:53,995
They know about Hayslip.

608
01:05:54,079 --> 01:05:58,375
They know you were in Canada,
and they have an Irishman helping them.

609
01:05:58,458 --> 01:06:01,128
- Irishman's name?
- Mulqueen.

610
01:06:02,754 --> 01:06:05,674
- Declan Mulqueen?
- Declan Mulqueen.

611
01:06:08,885 --> 01:06:10,971
The operation's still a go.

612
01:06:14,099 --> 01:06:15,142
Declan.

613
01:06:15,225 --> 01:06:19,521
Every crossing point and airport has
his photograph, but RCMP has nothing.

614
01:06:19,604 --> 01:06:22,774
Our Border Patrol,
the INS are both on the highest alert.

615
01:06:22,858 --> 01:06:24,401
Again, nothing.

616
01:06:24,484 --> 01:06:28,196
Let's face it, you don't have to be Houdini
to make it across from Canada.

617
01:06:28,280 --> 01:06:32,242
- He probably walked across.
- He won't be walking, I can tell you that.

618
01:06:32,492 --> 01:06:34,119
He's got a weapon to move.

619
01:06:34,411 --> 01:06:37,789
- What kind of patrols do you have here?
- The Great Lakes?

620
01:06:37,873 --> 01:06:39,708
Not a lot. No need.

621
01:06:39,791 --> 01:06:41,710
People either drive or fly.

622
01:06:42,002 --> 01:06:45,714
There are a few ferry services,
but we checked those out as well.

623
01:06:46,131 --> 01:06:47,924
What about people with boats?

624
01:06:48,008 --> 01:06:50,302
What kind of immigration controls
do you have?

625
01:06:50,385 --> 01:06:53,472
Arriving vessels have to
check with the harbormaster.

626
01:06:53,555 --> 01:06:57,267
- Voluntarily?
- Yeah. No active enforcement.

627
01:06:59,436 --> 01:07:02,898
Say he does use a boat,
he'll still want to mix with others.

628
01:07:03,857 --> 01:07:06,193
Are there many gatherings to speak of?

629
01:07:06,485 --> 01:07:08,695
Yeah, the Mackinaw Regatta
is going on now.

630
01:07:08,779 --> 01:07:12,115
- It's the biggest regatta on Lake Michigan.
- From where to where?

631
01:07:12,199 --> 01:07:15,994
It starts in Mackinaw
and it ends in Chicago.

632
01:08:24,271 --> 01:08:27,107
Witherspoon, take Waveland.

633
01:08:27,190 --> 01:08:29,693
Declan, Valentina: Chicago Yacht Club.

634
01:08:29,943 --> 01:08:32,320
I'll take the locals. And remember...

635
01:08:32,404 --> 01:08:36,616
...it'll be an Ontario boat if it's here.
Look at everything and stay on your radios.

636
01:08:36,700 --> 01:08:40,954
If you do find something, call in backup.
I want an arrest, not a firefight.

637
01:08:46,376 --> 01:08:48,503
All right, let's get to it.

638
01:08:50,589 --> 01:08:53,800
Preston, what about
letting me have a gun?

639
01:08:54,593 --> 01:08:56,052
Are you crazy?

640
01:08:56,136 --> 01:09:01,433
If the right people knew I was letting you
walk around I'd get forced retirement.

641
01:09:03,518 --> 01:09:05,520
No fucking gun.

642
01:09:09,357 --> 01:09:12,903
- So many people.
- So many rich people.

643
01:09:13,070 --> 01:09:14,780
Shall we dance?

644
01:09:15,697 --> 01:09:17,699
He wouldn't give me a gun.

645
01:10:14,339 --> 01:10:15,590
He is hot.

646
01:10:17,092 --> 01:10:19,177
He's mine. Back off.

647
01:10:23,140 --> 01:10:25,100
Hey, you want some champagne?

648
01:10:25,183 --> 01:10:27,894
- Come on. Join us.
- Maybe later.

649
01:10:27,978 --> 01:10:29,813
Join us.

650
01:12:16,545 --> 01:12:18,296
Declan!

651
01:12:50,954 --> 01:12:52,497
Get out of the way!

652
01:13:15,479 --> 01:13:18,190
Preston, can I talk to you?

653
01:13:22,235 --> 01:13:24,321
Look, he saw me. He wasn't surprised.

654
01:13:24,404 --> 01:13:26,198
Like he was expecting me.

655
01:13:26,281 --> 01:13:28,658
One of your team
is playing for the other side.

656
01:13:28,742 --> 01:13:30,744
I can vouch for every man on this team.

657
01:13:30,827 --> 01:13:33,580
- You've got a traitor.
- This is not the IRA.

658
01:13:33,663 --> 01:13:36,500
- We don't get infiltrators.
- Somebody got to him.

659
01:13:37,667 --> 01:13:41,755
This is a manhunt, not your cause.
Don't make it personal.

660
01:13:42,339 --> 01:13:44,716
What do you fucking know?

661
01:13:54,101 --> 01:13:55,811
I'll tell you what I know.

662
01:13:55,894 --> 01:13:59,106
I know the Jackal set you up
in that arms deal in Libya.

663
01:13:59,356 --> 01:14:02,734
I know Isabella was wounded
when you walked into the trap.

664
01:14:03,235 --> 01:14:05,987
I also know that it was
the business you had chosen.

665
01:14:06,071 --> 01:14:09,574
Did you also know that Isabella
was pregnant when she got shot?

666
01:14:09,658 --> 01:14:11,910
That our child didn't survive?

667
01:14:16,456 --> 01:14:19,334
Don't tell me it's not personal, Mr. Preston.

668
01:14:22,003 --> 01:14:24,881
I can't let you jeopardize us in a vendetta.

669
01:14:25,048 --> 01:14:26,967
There's no vendetta.

670
01:14:27,384 --> 01:14:30,595
All I hope for is a fresh start, you know?

671
01:14:36,685 --> 01:14:38,979
Maybe it'll happen.

672
01:16:09,069 --> 01:16:11,530
This was recorded at 1:00 a. m.

673
01:16:11,613 --> 01:16:15,033
It's a call to a number
in Brighton Beach, New York.

674
01:16:16,451 --> 01:16:17,744
Item four:

675
01:16:17,828 --> 01:16:21,748
At 1:05 p. m. Director Brown
is scheduled to meet the First Lady...

676
01:16:21,832 --> 01:16:24,084
...at a reception at the White House...

677
01:16:24,167 --> 01:16:26,711
...regarding the New Hope Hospital
opening.

678
01:16:26,795 --> 01:16:29,131
Other participants will be decided...

679
01:16:31,383 --> 01:16:33,802
That information came out of this room.

680
01:16:36,346 --> 01:16:39,391
Who? Whose voice is it on that tape?

681
01:16:46,314 --> 01:16:48,275
Mine.

682
01:16:52,279 --> 01:16:53,989
Mr. Ambassador.

683
01:16:54,072 --> 01:16:56,700
We have arranged to hold
a flight to Moscow.

684
01:16:56,783 --> 01:17:00,162
A car is waiting to drive
Colonel Bolitonov to the airport.

685
01:17:17,054 --> 01:17:19,306
How did you know whose phone to tap?

686
01:17:19,389 --> 01:17:23,226
I didn't, so I tapped everybody's.

687
01:17:24,186 --> 01:17:27,314
But I have diplomatic immunity.

688
01:17:27,814 --> 01:17:30,484
Who authorized you to tap my telephone?

689
01:17:30,567 --> 01:17:32,152
I did, Ambassador.

690
01:17:32,235 --> 01:17:36,198
We're currently examining documents
taken from Bolitonov's apartment.

691
01:17:52,464 --> 01:17:54,382
Get me a helicopter.

692
01:18:21,701 --> 01:18:23,286
Jackal.

693
01:18:23,495 --> 01:18:27,416
Director Bolitonov
is no longer contactable at this number.

694
01:18:27,624 --> 01:18:30,001
All inquiries should be forwarded to...

695
01:18:35,841 --> 01:18:39,469
This is only a precaution for a short while,
until we get this man.

696
01:18:39,553 --> 01:18:41,972
You and your family
will be safer in Washington.

697
01:18:42,055 --> 01:18:44,516
You really think you'll find him?
You won't.

698
01:18:44,599 --> 01:18:47,811
- Believe me, you can't.
- It's our job to try.

699
01:18:47,894 --> 01:18:51,314
And waste your time
and maybe get killed for nothing?

700
01:18:53,775 --> 01:18:55,193
I began this.

701
01:18:55,318 --> 01:18:59,448
I have to do what I can,
so please get your family away.

702
01:19:05,829 --> 01:19:07,372
Let's go.

703
01:19:23,805 --> 01:19:24,890
Everything okay?

704
01:19:24,973 --> 01:19:29,853
Valentina's evacuating Isabella and her
family in case he knows where she lives.

705
01:19:32,773 --> 01:19:35,734
Look, the director doesn't even know
where Isabella lives.

706
01:19:35,817 --> 01:19:39,988
I ordered Witherspoon to keep her
out of the report. No way Jackal knows.

707
01:19:40,405 --> 01:19:44,618
Well, our Russian black-heart surely passed
everything else to him, didn't he?

708
01:19:44,701 --> 01:19:46,536
Here, look.

709
01:19:48,830 --> 01:19:51,708
That's your phone number.
That's Valentina's.

710
01:19:51,792 --> 01:19:54,002
You know those two at the bottom?

711
01:19:57,297 --> 01:19:59,549
The first one's the Russian Embassy.

712
01:20:01,009 --> 01:20:02,969
The second one's...

713
01:20:05,430 --> 01:20:08,058
- Son of a bitch.
- What?

714
01:20:09,559 --> 01:20:12,354
This is an FBI access code.

715
01:20:17,818 --> 01:20:20,862
- FBI Data Center.
- This is Special Agent Carter Preston.

716
01:20:20,946 --> 01:20:24,866
- My authorization number is 223578-Kilo.
- Shit!

717
01:20:24,950 --> 01:20:29,663
I need a voice transcription of field report
November Alpha from 9-15 this year.

718
01:20:29,746 --> 01:20:33,583
Agent filing: Witherspoon, Timothy I.
And I'm in a hurry, operator.

719
01:20:38,130 --> 01:20:40,090
I shouldn't have trusted you.

720
01:20:42,759 --> 01:20:45,095
Field report November Alpha...

721
01:20:45,262 --> 01:20:48,014
...filed 9:00 a. M...
- Scroll.

722
01:20:48,223 --> 01:20:52,436
To perform interview of subject
Isabella Zancona at the following address...

723
01:20:52,519 --> 01:20:55,480
Witherspoon, you by-the-book asshole!

724
01:21:12,789 --> 01:21:14,708
I'm gonna check upstairs.

725
01:21:14,916 --> 01:21:16,918
Witherspoon?

726
01:21:42,486 --> 01:21:44,196
Witherspoon?

727
01:21:53,914 --> 01:21:55,624
Witherspoon?

728
01:22:10,013 --> 01:22:11,723
Come out!

729
01:22:12,349 --> 01:22:14,059
Please don't shoot me.

730
01:22:15,560 --> 01:22:17,479
Just taking out the garbage.

731
01:22:18,772 --> 01:22:20,774
- I got one more trip.
- Hurry.

732
01:22:20,857 --> 01:22:24,069
- We'll meet you at the front.
- Yes, ma'am.

733
01:22:32,369 --> 01:22:35,789
All locked up. Where's Witherspoon?

734
01:22:35,872 --> 01:22:38,458
He's in the backyard, taking out the trash.

735
01:22:41,086 --> 01:22:43,422
It's coming from the back. Let's go!

736
01:22:58,395 --> 01:23:01,231
- Where is it coming from?
- I don't know.

737
01:23:26,798 --> 01:23:29,051
Set to go off two minutes ago.

738
01:23:30,510 --> 01:23:32,512
What the hell?

739
01:23:34,181 --> 01:23:36,141
Where's McMurphy?

740
01:25:36,219 --> 01:25:40,098
Press here, hard. It'll slow the bleeding.

741
01:25:53,403 --> 01:25:55,739
See, that's bad.

742
01:25:56,323 --> 01:25:59,785
Blood's almost black.
That means the bullet's in your liver.

743
01:26:00,285 --> 01:26:02,454
You got about 20 minutes to live.

744
01:26:03,330 --> 01:26:06,625
If the pain gets too much,
you can take your hand away...

745
01:26:07,000 --> 01:26:10,295
...and you'll be dead in five minutes.

746
01:26:15,926 --> 01:26:20,097
When Declan kills you,
you think of me, okay?

747
01:26:25,852 --> 01:26:27,771
I'll make a note of that.

748
01:26:29,815 --> 01:26:31,566
If you see Declan...

749
01:26:31,650 --> 01:26:36,196
...before you die, you tell him
that he can't protect his women.

750
01:27:03,098 --> 01:27:05,767
They're all right. Let them through.

751
01:27:09,646 --> 01:27:11,398
Valentina?

752
01:27:15,944 --> 01:27:17,654
You'll be fine.

753
01:27:17,738 --> 01:27:19,781
- Yeah.
- Hi.

754
01:27:27,789 --> 01:27:30,459
It's all right, darling. You're gonna be fine.

755
01:27:30,625 --> 01:27:32,627
I tried...

756
01:27:33,545 --> 01:27:35,464
...to protect Isabella.

757
01:27:35,672 --> 01:27:38,133
I know. You did fine.

758
01:27:39,259 --> 01:27:42,054
He said to tell you...

759
01:27:42,888 --> 01:27:44,097
...say...

760
01:27:44,264 --> 01:27:48,560
..."You can't protect your women. "

761
01:27:52,022 --> 01:27:53,940
Valentina.

762
01:27:54,483 --> 01:27:58,570
No, Valentina. No, don't. Valentina!

763
01:27:58,820 --> 01:28:01,615
Don't go. Stay with me.

764
01:28:58,588 --> 01:29:00,632
It was him, wasn't it?

765
01:29:01,550 --> 01:29:03,802
I thought this was all behind us.

766
01:29:05,387 --> 01:29:07,723
Is this ever gonna end?

767
01:29:08,890 --> 01:29:12,519
Yes. I promise you, it will end...

768
01:29:16,648 --> 01:29:18,650
...and I will end it.

769
01:29:23,739 --> 01:29:25,699
Do you have a gun?

770
01:29:43,550 --> 01:29:45,844
Following a low-light helicopter insertion...

771
01:29:45,927 --> 01:29:48,430
...a team could infiltrate the weapon here...

772
01:29:48,513 --> 01:29:51,475
...covering the northern approaches
and Route 1.

773
01:29:51,558 --> 01:29:55,562
If your weapon has nearly the range
and cyclic rate you're advertising...

774
01:29:55,729 --> 01:29:59,024
...it could engage
any ground vehicle and aircraft.

775
01:29:59,107 --> 01:30:03,570
He doesn't have a helicopter
or a team to help him set up.

776
01:30:03,653 --> 01:30:05,572
He's alone.

777
01:30:06,073 --> 01:30:07,783
What do you say, Mulqueen?

778
01:30:07,866 --> 01:30:11,828
Well, the only way he can make
the kill and escape is from a distance.

779
01:30:13,663 --> 01:30:16,500
So we make sure you're
always secure indoors...

780
01:30:16,666 --> 01:30:19,503
...with a perimeter of men
outside your location.

781
01:30:19,586 --> 01:30:22,130
- And pick our battles?
- Exactly.

782
01:30:23,423 --> 01:30:25,592
Tying a noose, if you like.

783
01:30:26,218 --> 01:30:27,928
When he makes his move...

784
01:30:28,011 --> 01:30:30,597
...we tighten the noose and we hang him.

785
01:30:31,223 --> 01:30:33,600
Not exactly foolproof, I know...

786
01:30:33,683 --> 01:30:36,603
...but it's the best we got.
- The best we've got?

787
01:30:43,110 --> 01:30:45,946
- You have a call on line six.
- Thank you.

788
01:30:48,657 --> 01:30:51,201
- This is Doug.
- Told you I'd call.

789
01:30:51,618 --> 01:30:53,578
Hi. How are you?

790
01:30:53,662 --> 01:30:56,206
You've just have to have
a little faith in people.

791
01:30:58,542 --> 01:31:01,461
Okay. Well, okay.
Now that I've got faith...

792
01:31:01,545 --> 01:31:03,964
...are you busy tonight?
You're in town, yes?

793
01:31:24,401 --> 01:31:26,528
Hello?

794
01:31:28,739 --> 01:31:30,323
I'm home.

795
01:31:34,411 --> 01:31:36,163
I see you found the keys.

796
01:31:37,289 --> 01:31:39,124
Where are you?

797
01:31:39,458 --> 01:31:41,376
In the garage!

798
01:31:52,429 --> 01:31:56,016
- Wow. You dyed your hair.
- Yeah.

799
01:31:56,558 --> 01:31:58,143
Like it?

800
01:32:00,395 --> 01:32:02,439
Yeah, sure.

801
01:32:06,610 --> 01:32:08,528
You like Korean food?

802
01:32:09,404 --> 01:32:11,531
Sure. Yeah.

803
01:32:12,491 --> 01:32:14,117
Dig in.

804
01:32:17,704 --> 01:32:20,457
I thought we were gonna...

805
01:32:20,749 --> 01:32:22,501
Oh, I'm sorry.

806
01:32:26,254 --> 01:32:28,256
I thought we were gonna go out.

807
01:32:28,340 --> 01:32:30,842
Yeah. Maybe later.

808
01:32:35,013 --> 01:32:36,973
Recapping tonight's top story...

809
01:32:37,057 --> 01:32:39,976
...police are asking for your help
in locating this man.

810
01:32:40,060 --> 01:32:43,438
He's wanted in connection
with a series of brutal murders.

811
01:32:43,522 --> 01:32:46,149
Police believe he's in
the Washington area tonight.

812
01:32:46,233 --> 01:32:48,652
The man is armed
and extremely dangerous.

813
01:32:48,735 --> 01:32:53,198
If you see him, do not to approach him,
but notify authorities immediately.

814
01:34:00,716 --> 01:34:01,759
You know, when I first moved here...

815
01:34:02,718 --> 01:34:05,930
...I realized I was living
in someone else's house...

816
01:34:06,263 --> 01:34:08,724
...and that's a huge burden.
You're invited...

817
01:34:08,807 --> 01:34:11,352
...to live in the White House for four years...

818
01:34:11,435 --> 01:34:13,229
You feel like a renter in a sense?

819
01:34:13,312 --> 01:34:16,565
Most definitely.
With a lease that's renewable or...

820
01:34:16,690 --> 01:34:20,986
John F. Kennedy said once that if
somebody wanted to kill a public official...

821
01:34:21,070 --> 01:34:24,323
...they can get away with it
if they're willing to pay the price.

822
01:34:24,406 --> 01:34:28,118
It's impossible to provide
100 percent safety. Would you agree?

823
01:34:28,327 --> 01:34:29,995
Certainly.

824
01:34:30,079 --> 01:34:32,456
There is no way around that,
but hopefully...

825
01:34:32,540 --> 01:34:36,001
...there aren't that many people
who are willing to do that.

826
01:34:38,128 --> 01:34:38,879
What?

827
01:34:38,963 --> 01:34:42,675
Do you remember Valentina said,
"A statement, public and brutal. "

828
01:34:42,967 --> 01:34:45,553
Now, it always bothered me.
Why did he keep coming?

829
01:34:45,636 --> 01:34:49,181
He knew we could protect the director,
especially once I got involved.

830
01:34:49,265 --> 01:34:51,350
But he didn't abort. Why?

831
01:34:51,433 --> 01:34:54,854
It didn't come together until
I remembered what he said to Valentina.

832
01:34:54,937 --> 01:34:57,523
"Tell Declan he can't protect his women. "

833
01:34:57,690 --> 01:35:01,402
- Wasn't he referring to Isabella?
- No. Any woman. All women.

834
01:35:01,485 --> 01:35:04,738
But remember, "public and brutal. "

835
01:35:05,447 --> 01:35:08,826
We're guarding the wrong person.
He's after the First Lady.

836
01:36:07,343 --> 01:36:10,346
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome.

837
01:36:10,679 --> 01:36:13,474
I'm sure you're as happy
as I am to be here today.

838
01:36:13,557 --> 01:36:16,018
It's been a lot of hard work for a lot of us...

839
01:36:16,101 --> 01:36:19,688
...but here we are,
and we're about to celebrate.

840
01:36:19,772 --> 01:36:23,442
And now it gives me great pleasure
to introduce the Surgeon General...

841
01:36:23,526 --> 01:36:25,569
...of the United States.

842
01:36:30,282 --> 01:36:33,118
Madam Chairperson,
ladies and gentlemen...

843
01:36:33,994 --> 01:36:37,206
...I'd like to chat with you today
about the family.

844
01:36:59,186 --> 01:37:00,771
She's already on the stage.

845
01:37:00,855 --> 01:37:03,148
Secret Service wants to know
what's going on.

846
01:37:03,232 --> 01:37:06,026
- Tell them.
- No, they'll try to get her off the stage.

847
01:37:06,110 --> 01:37:08,946
If they do that,
he'll shoot off into the crowd.

848
01:37:20,416 --> 01:37:23,085
We've worked long and hard
to reach our goal...

849
01:37:23,169 --> 01:37:26,714
...and I must say that we have
accomplished what we set out to do...

850
01:37:26,797 --> 01:37:28,674
...since we first began...

851
01:37:28,757 --> 01:37:30,634
...with a seed of an idea.

852
01:37:30,718 --> 01:37:33,470
It took many long and hard hours to...

853
01:37:44,607 --> 01:37:45,941
Get the word?

854
01:37:46,025 --> 01:37:50,154
Looking for a dark brown minivan
and anything else that's out of place.

855
01:37:50,237 --> 01:37:52,823
The only minivan we found
is this red one here.

856
01:37:52,907 --> 01:37:55,868
I checked it out.
They got a local parking permit...

857
01:37:55,951 --> 01:37:57,495
...DC tags.

858
01:37:57,578 --> 01:37:59,955
We can check it out again, if you want.

859
01:38:00,080 --> 01:38:03,709
It's probably one of those safer-than-sorry,
circle-jerk type deals.

860
01:38:03,792 --> 01:38:05,252
I'll see you.

861
01:38:05,336 --> 01:38:07,254
You guys be safe.

862
01:38:24,230 --> 01:38:27,233
Secret Service says
the search came out negative.

863
01:38:27,441 --> 01:38:30,236
They're on alert,
but she's going to the podium.

864
01:38:30,319 --> 01:38:32,321
Guess it's on us.

865
01:38:37,076 --> 01:38:38,994
You'll need a gun.

866
01:38:49,421 --> 01:38:53,259
Forget the laser. You'll have to walk me
through the optics on this thing.

867
01:38:53,342 --> 01:38:55,678
I haven't shot a gun in a while.

868
01:39:03,269 --> 01:39:06,605
I can see by the warm
and friendly faces out there...

869
01:39:06,689 --> 01:39:09,775
...that this christening
has been long anticipated.

870
01:39:10,693 --> 01:39:14,697
Thanks to all of you
who made this dream possible.

871
01:39:15,364 --> 01:39:18,534
We've worked long and hard
to reach our goal...

872
01:39:18,617 --> 01:39:22,454
...and I must say that we certainly have
accomplished what we set out to do.

873
01:39:29,753 --> 01:39:34,175
It's proof that when we set out
to reach new heights, it can be done.

874
01:40:11,212 --> 01:40:13,422
Go! Clear!

875
01:40:21,680 --> 01:40:23,724
Go! Clear!

876
01:40:31,357 --> 01:40:33,442
I'm going for the First Lady.

877
01:40:33,526 --> 01:40:36,612
You're cleared to shoot
on the weapon or the shooter.

878
01:40:40,991 --> 01:40:43,661
Ladies and gentlemen,
it gives me great pleasure...

879
01:40:43,744 --> 01:40:47,164
...to introduce the First Lady
of the United States.

880
01:40:55,005 --> 01:40:58,425
It's a beautiful day
for the beginning of New Hope.

881
01:41:01,512 --> 01:41:04,515
All right. Go!

882
01:41:53,022 --> 01:41:55,024
Give me the gun.

883
01:42:13,042 --> 01:42:14,960
So that's how he plans to get out.

884
01:42:15,044 --> 01:42:17,254
The phone, give me your phone.

885
01:42:34,813 --> 01:42:36,524
But also right now...

886
01:42:36,607 --> 01:42:39,818
...there are police officers
risking their very lives...

887
01:42:39,902 --> 01:42:43,030
...to help kids stay out of trouble
and off drugs.

888
01:42:57,795 --> 01:42:59,463
But also right now,
there are dedicated teachers...

889
01:43:00,464 --> 01:43:03,634
...preparing lessons for a new day's class.

890
01:43:06,303 --> 01:43:09,723
- Red minivan, hillside by the trees.
- One o'clock.

891
01:43:11,392 --> 01:43:13,477
- Jesus.
- Range it.

892
01:43:14,645 --> 01:43:17,523
750, 762 meters.

893
01:43:20,776 --> 01:43:23,320
...but values his family.

894
01:44:02,568 --> 01:44:05,571
Right. I'm after him.
You take out the minivan.

895
01:44:44,944 --> 01:44:47,821
Move it! Go!

896
01:45:38,497 --> 01:45:40,499
Coming through!

897
01:46:02,563 --> 01:46:04,190
Look out! Coming through!

898
01:46:10,613 --> 01:46:13,240
- Excuse me.
- Watch it, man!

899
01:47:12,258 --> 01:47:14,677
Please stand clear of the doors.

900
01:47:45,082 --> 01:47:46,584
No!

901
01:47:57,011 --> 01:47:58,554
Shit!

902
01:48:00,514 --> 01:48:03,601
The next train departing Capitol Heights...

903
01:51:12,122 --> 01:51:14,333
Help me, please!

904
01:51:21,215 --> 01:51:22,925
Help me!

905
01:51:25,427 --> 01:51:27,972
- Say, "Help me, Declan. "
- Help me, Declan.

906
01:51:29,306 --> 01:51:31,517
Help me, Declan!

907
01:51:36,313 --> 01:51:38,190
Please help!

908
01:51:40,693 --> 01:51:42,945
Please, Declan, help me!

909
01:51:45,364 --> 01:51:48,284
Please help me!

910
01:51:54,707 --> 01:51:55,708
Louder!

911
01:51:55,791 --> 01:51:58,794
- Help me, Declan!
- Help me, Declan!

912
01:52:00,254 --> 01:52:03,174
Now tell him where I'm aiming the gun.

913
01:52:04,925 --> 01:52:07,678
Good girl.

914
01:52:10,389 --> 01:52:12,766
What are you gonna do, Declan?

915
01:52:12,850 --> 01:52:15,769
You just can't seem to protect
any of your women.

916
01:52:16,604 --> 01:52:19,106
Let her go.
She has nothing to do with this.

917
01:52:19,190 --> 01:52:21,233
Now, you can save this girl.

918
01:52:21,317 --> 01:52:23,611
- What's your name?
- Maggie.

919
01:52:23,694 --> 01:52:25,821
You can save Maggie, you see?

920
01:52:25,905 --> 01:52:27,823
You can save her right now.

921
01:52:28,449 --> 01:52:31,035
You just have to put down your little gun.

922
01:52:33,829 --> 01:52:35,831
Okay?

923
01:52:44,006 --> 01:52:45,841
No!

924
01:52:50,054 --> 01:52:52,640
Go ahead. Take a shot.

925
01:52:57,770 --> 01:53:01,649
Oh, Maggie, you did so good.

926
01:53:05,736 --> 01:53:07,863
You're slipping, Declan.

927
01:53:14,411 --> 01:53:16,497
Now let her go.

928
01:53:16,831 --> 01:53:18,916
Step away from the gun.

929
01:53:19,500 --> 01:53:22,044
Step away from the gun!

930
01:53:22,127 --> 01:53:24,421
Maggie, Maggie.

931
01:53:24,505 --> 01:53:26,215
You're so brave.

932
01:53:26,298 --> 01:53:29,051
You'll remember this
for the rest of your life.

933
01:53:35,891 --> 01:53:37,601
Kneel down.

934
01:53:41,939 --> 01:53:43,691
Kneel down.

935
01:54:08,007 --> 01:54:09,884
Sorry, Declan.

936
01:55:34,260 --> 01:55:36,762
It's all right. It's okay.

937
01:55:37,638 --> 01:55:39,223
It's okay.

938
01:55:45,020 --> 01:55:46,897
It's finished.

939
01:56:33,194 --> 01:56:35,738
I wonder if we'll ever know...

940
01:56:35,821 --> 01:56:38,449
...who the hell he really was.

941
01:56:39,742 --> 01:56:42,161
We know all we need to. He was evil...

942
01:56:43,329 --> 01:56:46,207
...he's dead and he's gone.
Nothing more matters.

943
01:56:48,918 --> 01:56:52,755
Sorry they didn't give you your pardon.
You'll get minimum security.

944
01:56:52,922 --> 01:56:54,715
It's like a country club.

945
01:56:54,798 --> 01:56:58,469
By the way,
Director Brown sends his warmest thanks.

946
01:56:58,636 --> 01:57:01,931
Oh, that's nice.
Look forward to playing tennis with him.

947
01:57:03,224 --> 01:57:05,476
Did I tell you I'm going back to Russia?

948
01:57:05,559 --> 01:57:10,147
And I'm going to stay until Terek Murad
rots in prison or in the grave.

949
01:57:11,857 --> 01:57:13,567
She'd appreciate that.

950
01:57:14,443 --> 01:57:16,153
I think so.

951
01:57:16,445 --> 01:57:18,239
And Isabella?

952
01:57:19,698 --> 01:57:22,243
Back safe with her family.

953
01:57:22,451 --> 01:57:24,370
For good.

954
01:57:24,578 --> 01:57:27,206
I know about that key she gave you.

955
01:57:27,998 --> 01:57:31,585
I know you could have used it
to take off any time you wanted to.

956
01:57:31,710 --> 01:57:35,548
You've got one of those
drop boxes, too, like the Jackal?

957
01:57:38,092 --> 01:57:41,387
Did you read the paper today?
I'm quite the hero because of you.

958
01:57:41,470 --> 01:57:44,223
The agent who saved the First Lady.

959
01:57:44,765 --> 01:57:48,811
I could screw everything else up
for the rest of my life and still be...

960
01:57:49,311 --> 01:57:50,813
...untouchable.

961
01:57:51,772 --> 01:57:53,023
That a fact, then?

962
01:57:54,191 --> 01:57:56,694
Going back to the drop box:

963
01:57:57,027 --> 01:57:59,488
An operative with your experience...

964
01:57:59,572 --> 01:58:01,615
...with a clean passport...

965
01:58:01,699 --> 01:58:03,617
...a wad of cash.

966
01:58:04,577 --> 01:58:07,830
I'll bet if you had taken off...

967
01:58:10,833 --> 01:58:12,960
...we never would have found you.

968
01:58:16,589 --> 01:58:18,132
Do you drink coffee?

969
01:58:18,215 --> 01:58:21,302
Oh, no, that's right.
They drink Guinness in Ireland.

970
01:58:22,303 --> 01:58:25,764
I'll ask across the street.
See if they've got any.

971
01:58:26,098 --> 01:58:27,725
Coffee, I mean.

972
01:58:27,808 --> 01:58:29,602
I'll be back in...

973
01:58:30,561 --> 01:58:33,397
...thirty minutes, okay?

974
01:58:39,528 --> 01:58:41,864
Thanks, Declan, for everything.

975
01:58:43,032 --> 01:58:44,950
No, thank you.
