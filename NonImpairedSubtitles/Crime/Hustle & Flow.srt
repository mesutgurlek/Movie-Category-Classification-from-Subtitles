1
00:01:02,209 --> 00:01:03,437
See...

2
00:01:03,643 --> 00:01:05,838
...man ain't like a dog.

3
00:01:06,213 --> 00:01:08,306
And when I say "man,"

4
00:01:08,515 --> 00:01:12,315
I'm talking about man
as in mankind, not man as in men.

5
00:01:12,519 --> 00:01:13,952
Because men,

6
00:01:14,154 --> 00:01:16,418
well, we a lot like a dog.

7
00:01:16,623 --> 00:01:19,490
You know, we like to piss on things.

8
00:01:20,026 --> 00:01:22,017
Sniff a bitch when we can.

9
00:01:22,229 --> 00:01:25,221
Even get a little pink hard-on
the way they do.

10
00:01:25,432 --> 00:01:29,232
We territorial as shit, you know,
we gonna protect our own.

11
00:01:29,569 --> 00:01:31,434
But man...

12
00:01:32,105 --> 00:01:34,232
...he know about death.

13
00:01:34,674 --> 00:01:37,040
Got him a sense of history.

14
00:01:37,577 --> 00:01:39,067
Got religion.

15
00:01:39,279 --> 00:01:40,712
See...

16
00:01:40,914 --> 00:01:42,404
...a dog...

17
00:01:42,616 --> 00:01:47,076
Man, a dog don't know shit
about no birthdays or Christmas

18
00:01:47,287 --> 00:01:49,380
or Easter bunny, none of that shit.

19
00:01:49,589 --> 00:01:51,079
And one day
God gonna come calling,

20
00:01:51,291 --> 00:01:53,589
so, you know,
they going through life carefree.

21
00:01:53,794 --> 00:01:57,093
But people like you and me, man,
we always guessing.

22
00:01:57,297 --> 00:02:00,562
Wondering, "What if?"
You know what I mean?

23
00:02:02,335 --> 00:02:04,394
So when you say to me,

24
00:02:04,604 --> 00:02:06,265
"Hey, I don't think
we should be doing this,"

25
00:02:06,473 --> 00:02:09,567
I gotta say, baby, I don't think
we need to be doing this neither,

26
00:02:09,776 --> 00:02:12,677
but we ain't gonna get no move on
in this world, lying around in the sun,

27
00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:14,813
licking our ass all day.

28
00:02:15,015 --> 00:02:16,812
I mean, we man.

29
00:02:17,017 --> 00:02:20,783
I mean, you a woman and all,
but we man.

30
00:02:21,888 --> 00:02:23,913
So with this said...

31
00:02:24,591 --> 00:02:29,460
...you tell me what it is
you wanna do with your life.

32
00:02:42,809 --> 00:02:44,743
I don't know.

33
00:02:45,579 --> 00:02:48,980
- I mean, I guess I could, like...
- Hold up a second.

34
00:02:53,453 --> 00:02:55,683
What's happening with you, man?

35
00:02:58,024 --> 00:03:00,322
You like what you see, huh?

36
00:03:02,896 --> 00:03:05,160
Look here, baby,
it break down like this:

37
00:03:05,365 --> 00:03:07,856
Twenty in the front, 40 in the back.

38
00:03:09,302 --> 00:03:11,031
Hello?

39
00:03:12,906 --> 00:03:16,603
Why don't you walk over there
and explain it to that motherfucker.

40
00:04:39,926 --> 00:04:41,655
- Damn.
- From the D&Z sports desk,

41
00:04:41,861 --> 00:04:43,385
I'm Dennis Phillippi, and the answer...

42
00:04:46,099 --> 00:04:49,500
- Hot 107. 1, number one for hip-hop...
- Nothing but a bunch of jive and junk.

43
00:04:49,703 --> 00:04:51,694
Coming up, your chance
to win a trip to Las Vegas.

44
00:04:52,238 --> 00:04:55,901
Holler at your boy, it's Hot 107. 1.

45
00:05:14,561 --> 00:05:17,655
- Please! Fucking with me, man! Hey!
- Hey, hey, hey!

46
00:05:17,864 --> 00:05:18,922
Hey, what the hell?!

47
00:05:19,132 --> 00:05:21,191
- Pull that shit again,
- Motherfucker, how you like that?

48
00:05:21,401 --> 00:05:22,732
Boot your ass to hell.

49
00:05:23,036 --> 00:05:24,799
- You heard me!
- Get the fuck up out of here.

50
00:05:25,005 --> 00:05:27,166
Deranged son of a bitch!

51
00:05:32,445 --> 00:05:35,937
- You all right, Nola?
- Thanks, D.

52
00:05:36,149 --> 00:05:39,482
Come on in, man. Come on in here.

53
00:05:39,686 --> 00:05:42,211
Damn, man, you gotta
get some security up in here.

54
00:05:42,422 --> 00:05:44,890
I'm the only
motherfucking security in here.

55
00:05:46,726 --> 00:05:49,160
Sure is good
not to be cracking heads.

56
00:05:49,362 --> 00:05:51,262
So, what you need, man,
a half or full O?

57
00:05:51,464 --> 00:05:55,059
Ounce will do good.
Fourth coming up and all.

58
00:05:55,301 --> 00:05:57,132
Righteous, man.

59
00:05:57,337 --> 00:05:59,032
Hey, you remember
that sticky herb you brung up

60
00:05:59,239 --> 00:06:01,298
to my brother's house for playoffs?

61
00:06:02,208 --> 00:06:05,541
Yeah, I remember that shit.
That ain't this, now, man.

62
00:06:05,745 --> 00:06:08,714
We talking about... That's
a whole other zip-up bag on that.

63
00:06:08,915 --> 00:06:10,576
That's fucking prime product
right there.

64
00:06:11,017 --> 00:06:14,145
We got some big company
coming in here for the Fourth.

65
00:06:14,354 --> 00:06:16,982
Thought you may want
to get you some money.

66
00:06:17,190 --> 00:06:18,782
- Big company?
- Yeah.

67
00:06:18,992 --> 00:06:21,927
- Like what?
- You know Skinny Black?

68
00:06:22,362 --> 00:06:23,624
Skinny Black.

69
00:06:23,830 --> 00:06:25,764
Yeah, that...
Yeah, I know who Skinny is, man.

70
00:06:25,965 --> 00:06:28,058
I know Skinny from
way back in the day.

71
00:06:28,268 --> 00:06:30,498
See, I know Skinny
when he was hustling

72
00:06:30,704 --> 00:06:33,195
his underground tapes
down at the drive-in,

73
00:06:33,406 --> 00:06:35,670
out the back of his Cutlass.

74
00:06:35,875 --> 00:06:39,436
Not no more he ain't.
Last one he put out went platinum.

75
00:06:39,646 --> 00:06:41,944
- Platinum?
- Yeah.

76
00:06:42,148 --> 00:06:44,878
- That's more special than gold, right?
- But he's still in Memphis.

77
00:06:45,085 --> 00:06:47,986
He and his brother Tigga hook up with
their friends every Fourth of July.

78
00:06:48,421 --> 00:06:51,117
I shut the place down,
make it all private for them.

79
00:06:51,791 --> 00:06:53,019
And they just buy me out.

80
00:06:53,226 --> 00:06:54,921
- Bullshit.
- No shit.

81
00:06:55,128 --> 00:06:56,618
Yo, Skinny rolling like that, man?

82
00:06:56,830 --> 00:06:59,697
Best get your ass up here
with that good shit.

83
00:06:59,899 --> 00:07:01,764
Those boys don't want
none of this dirt weed.

84
00:07:02,435 --> 00:07:04,130
So you're trying
to hurt my feelings, right?

85
00:07:04,337 --> 00:07:07,636
- Just trying to help out a friend.
- For sure, man.

86
00:07:17,183 --> 00:07:19,242
All right, all right, all right,
goddamn it,

87
00:07:19,452 --> 00:07:22,910
we're going into a 2-for-1
for all you balling motherfuckers.

88
00:07:23,123 --> 00:07:24,215
You gonna love this shit.

89
00:07:24,424 --> 00:07:27,689
These lovely ladies will be doing
two dances for the price of one.

90
00:07:27,894 --> 00:07:30,658
We got Luscious, we got Phoebe
and we got Lexus

91
00:07:30,864 --> 00:07:32,798
coming up to satellite one.

92
00:07:32,999 --> 00:07:34,694
- Mike.
- What up, D?

93
00:07:34,901 --> 00:07:36,596
- What's happening, baby?
- Wet out there, huh?

94
00:07:36,803 --> 00:07:37,827
Yeah, sorry, man.

95
00:07:38,037 --> 00:07:39,868
- It's like a motherfucker.
- All right.

96
00:07:45,478 --> 00:07:46,877
Hey, baby.

97
00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:51,412
- Hey, where Lex at?
- Over there on satellite one.

98
00:07:53,419 --> 00:07:55,444
Don't miss out. Take advantage.

99
00:07:55,655 --> 00:07:58,818
We got Monique coming up
on satellite one.

100
00:08:06,166 --> 00:08:08,726
- You'll love this, 2-for-1.
- What the fuck? Will you let me...

101
00:08:08,935 --> 00:08:12,598
These lovely ladies will be giving you
two dances for the price of one.

102
00:08:12,806 --> 00:08:15,900
- Come here. Excuse me, daddy.
- Don't you see me on a hustle?

103
00:08:16,109 --> 00:08:17,542
- Where you at?
- I ain't at shit.

104
00:08:17,744 --> 00:08:19,336
- I was on my third dance.
- Don't tell me...

105
00:08:19,546 --> 00:08:21,537
You think I can just run up in here,
snap my fingers

106
00:08:21,748 --> 00:08:23,739
and make these motherfuckers
throw their money at me?

107
00:08:23,950 --> 00:08:27,579
- Watch your motherfucking tone...
- I ain't even made payout yet!

108
00:08:27,787 --> 00:08:29,414
This one is pretty good.

109
00:08:29,622 --> 00:08:32,113
My motherfucking house
got broken into too, bitch.

110
00:08:32,325 --> 00:08:33,792
- Hell, no.
- Hell, yeah, they kicked

111
00:08:33,993 --> 00:08:37,895
both my doors in, girl. Stole the last
pound of hydro weed for the party.

112
00:08:38,498 --> 00:08:40,466
You hear that?

113
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:44,228
That's my gut saying,
"Hurry the fuck up," okay?

114
00:08:46,306 --> 00:08:47,773
- Come on.
- Look at this.

115
00:08:48,474 --> 00:08:51,375
Hell, no. Look at this shit. What
the fuck you call that, the clapper?

116
00:08:51,578 --> 00:08:54,445
Lights on, lights off. Don't play.
I'm gonna roll tonight.

117
00:08:55,114 --> 00:08:58,948
I don't care what you say, D,
I ain't working day shift no more.

118
00:08:59,419 --> 00:09:02,183
I don't care if I got to
take me a taxi ride home.

119
00:09:02,388 --> 00:09:05,221
- You gonna work if I say you gonna.
- I ain't working with these skank-ass,

120
00:09:05,425 --> 00:09:08,087
- trucker-bait ho's no more.
- Kiss my ass.

121
00:09:08,294 --> 00:09:10,819
- Bitch, fucking take my shit again.
- Shit don't make no sense.

122
00:09:11,598 --> 00:09:14,431
If I'd known y'all was gonna take your
sweet fucking time, I'd have come in.

123
00:09:14,634 --> 00:09:17,694
Trudy says she made $500
last night, $500, you heard me?

124
00:09:17,904 --> 00:09:20,338
- Bitch got that birthmark on her face?
- Five hundred dollars

125
00:09:20,540 --> 00:09:22,735
for dancing for some man
who makes cotton.

126
00:09:22,942 --> 00:09:24,967
- What she do for him? She tricking.
- It ain't fair.

127
00:09:25,178 --> 00:09:27,373
I'm tricking! I ain't making $500.

128
00:09:27,580 --> 00:09:28,706
- What the hell, fool?!
- Hey!

129
00:09:28,915 --> 00:09:30,678
- D. Djay.
- Get your ass away from our car.

130
00:09:30,884 --> 00:09:33,250
- What the fuck's wrong with you?
- Hey, D!

131
00:09:33,453 --> 00:09:35,717
- It's only me, it's Harold.
- Get the fuck away from my car!

132
00:09:35,922 --> 00:09:37,890
- It's me, Harold, Djay.
- Get away from my car, man.

133
00:09:38,091 --> 00:09:39,524
- It's your dog.
- You're lucky as shit,

134
00:09:39,726 --> 00:09:42,923
that's normally my barrels
under my fucking seat, motherfucker.

135
00:09:43,129 --> 00:09:46,860
- It's Djay, nigga!
- Okay, Djay, I didn't mean no harm.

136
00:09:47,233 --> 00:09:48,928
You got any of
that crankity-crank shit?

137
00:09:49,269 --> 00:09:51,931
Nigga, I'm gateway mother... Man,
don't waste my time on no bullshit.

138
00:09:52,138 --> 00:09:54,265
Wait, wait, wait. Check this out.
Check this out.

139
00:09:54,474 --> 00:09:55,907
Check this out.
What can I get for this?

140
00:09:56,109 --> 00:09:57,974
You think I look like
a pawnshop, man?

141
00:09:58,177 --> 00:10:00,168
Is that...? I got "pawnshop"
written on my forehead?

142
00:10:00,380 --> 00:10:02,610
Come on, Djay, fuck with me.

143
00:10:02,815 --> 00:10:05,181
- Fuck with me, Djay.
- Where you get it?

144
00:10:05,385 --> 00:10:07,285
You know the business.

145
00:10:07,887 --> 00:10:10,321
- You took that shit from little kids?
- No, none of that, man.

146
00:10:10,523 --> 00:10:13,492
I used to play this thing myself,
all the time.

147
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:16,727
- That shit work?
- Man, like a pro!

148
00:10:18,564 --> 00:10:20,828
Let me see that motherfucker, man.

149
00:10:23,636 --> 00:10:26,833
Yeah, man, I used to have
one of these when I was a little kid.

150
00:10:28,808 --> 00:10:31,936
- Shit wasn't as big, though.
- But that's bigger and better.

151
00:10:32,145 --> 00:10:33,203
Fuck with me, now, D.

152
00:10:33,413 --> 00:10:36,109
- Fuck with me, Djay!
- Shut the fuck up, man.

153
00:10:37,684 --> 00:10:40,118
- Nigga, I'll give you a quarter for it.
- A quarter?

154
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:43,414
Man, you mean a half and some. I can
get more than that at the pawnshop.

155
00:10:43,623 --> 00:10:45,853
Take that shit to the pawnshop,
let's see what you get.

156
00:10:46,059 --> 00:10:48,254
No, take it over there, man.
Give them your thumbprint.

157
00:10:48,461 --> 00:10:51,692
- You on. You got it, you got it.
- Hey, give me that bag, man.

158
00:10:52,398 --> 00:10:53,695
Shit.

159
00:10:53,900 --> 00:10:56,494
You the man. You got it going on.
It's all good.

160
00:10:56,703 --> 00:10:58,295
Nigga, you advertising my shit
right now.

161
00:10:58,504 --> 00:11:00,597
It's okay, I'm gonna
fuck with you anyhow. It's all good.

162
00:11:00,807 --> 00:11:03,037
You fucking with me already.

163
00:11:16,122 --> 00:11:18,556
Hey, Stevie Wonder!

164
00:11:18,925 --> 00:11:20,950
We hungry.

165
00:11:26,766 --> 00:11:28,597
Motherfucking Carl Lewis
or something.

166
00:11:28,801 --> 00:11:32,897
I called the power company about
getting an extension on the light bill.

167
00:11:33,106 --> 00:11:36,200
They say I gotta come down there,
stand in line.

168
00:11:36,409 --> 00:11:38,604
I can't be standing in line
how they do down there,

169
00:11:38,811 --> 00:11:40,972
not if I got Roger with me.

170
00:11:41,180 --> 00:11:42,807
You know, D?

171
00:11:46,786 --> 00:11:48,549
Man, it's Skinny goddamn Black,
you know...

172
00:11:48,755 --> 00:11:50,985
Hey! There goes Skinny Black, man.

173
00:11:51,190 --> 00:11:54,216
Hey, Lex. Lex, come here, baby!

174
00:11:54,427 --> 00:11:58,124
Look right there, look at that.
That is Skinny Black, man.

175
00:11:58,331 --> 00:12:01,664
Me and him gonna be kicking it over
at Arnel's club on the Fourth of July.

176
00:12:01,868 --> 00:12:05,736
- Ain't that some shit, huh?
- Who, you?

177
00:12:05,938 --> 00:12:08,498
Yeah, me and Skinny gonna do us
some little catching up.

178
00:12:08,708 --> 00:12:11,768
So am I supposed to piss myself
or something?

179
00:12:13,546 --> 00:12:16,982
Okay, let's see who it is
that you know is somebody, huh?

180
00:12:17,183 --> 00:12:21,711
Nobody in this here crib,
that's for damn sure.

181
00:12:22,088 --> 00:12:25,057
- Where my baby, Roger, at?
- No, no, Lex, please!

182
00:12:25,258 --> 00:12:27,453
I just put him to sleep, Lex!

183
00:12:27,660 --> 00:12:30,424
Skinny used to DJ over at Booker T.
The same way I did at Westwood.

184
00:12:30,630 --> 00:12:32,427
D, I know it's my job and all...

185
00:12:32,632 --> 00:12:34,293
Ain't like he the only nigga
can spit flow.

186
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:35,865
- But why she gotta wake Roger up?

187
00:12:36,302 --> 00:12:38,270
Ain't like he the only nigga
can spit some flow.

188
00:12:38,471 --> 00:12:39,563
D, I need time for me too,
now.

189
00:12:39,772 --> 00:12:43,139
Shit, I was just doing the same thing,
just over at my school.

190
00:12:43,342 --> 00:12:47,369
Ask anybody, man. Go ask Carlos
on the corner, he'd tell you.

191
00:12:47,580 --> 00:12:49,707
He was in my grade. Ask him.

192
00:12:50,249 --> 00:12:52,979
We gotta get that extension, D.

193
00:12:55,955 --> 00:12:59,288
Fuck. Paper money. Shit.

194
00:12:59,992 --> 00:13:01,892
See, now, back in the day
you wouldn't even catch me

195
00:13:02,095 --> 00:13:04,325
in this Bentley right here,
you'd catch me in a Crown Vic.

196
00:13:04,530 --> 00:13:08,022
Bitch. Shit, back in the day,

197
00:13:08,234 --> 00:13:09,861
- I was triple platinum. Ask anyone.
- D.

198
00:13:10,069 --> 00:13:13,038
- I think I'll take a shower. Here.
- I don't give a fuck, man.

199
00:13:13,239 --> 00:13:15,537
- I need you to watch Roger for me.
- Hey, give him to Shug!

200
00:13:15,741 --> 00:13:18,471
Shug say it's her chill time.
Come on.

201
00:13:18,678 --> 00:13:21,408
When is my chill time?

202
00:13:23,983 --> 00:13:30,149
Come on, man. Hey. Hey.
Hey, man. No, no, man.

203
00:13:30,356 --> 00:13:33,621
The bitch gotta go take a shower, man.
You relax your ass, man.

204
00:13:33,826 --> 00:13:36,454
Come here. Come here, man.

205
00:13:37,029 --> 00:13:39,998
Hey, man, you can't be
crying around like no bitch, man.

206
00:13:40,199 --> 00:13:43,362
Hey. Hey, get rid
of them tears, man.

207
00:13:43,569 --> 00:13:48,131
No. Cut them tears shit out, man.
Come on.

208
00:13:48,508 --> 00:13:51,705
Come on. Come on.

209
00:13:51,911 --> 00:13:54,345
Come on, come on. Here we go.
Here we go, man.

210
00:13:54,547 --> 00:13:58,108
Come on, come on.
Let me try something.

211
00:14:01,387 --> 00:14:03,218
All right, push that one.

212
00:14:14,634 --> 00:14:16,499
Do that. What is this right here?

213
00:14:22,241 --> 00:14:24,436
Hey, I like that, man. Do that again.

214
00:14:24,644 --> 00:14:26,509
Listen to that, man.

215
00:14:27,613 --> 00:14:30,673
Now, that shit buck, ain't it, man?
Do it again, man.

216
00:14:30,883 --> 00:14:32,908
What the fuck you doing
with my boy?

217
00:14:33,119 --> 00:14:34,916
- Come on, give him to me.
- We just playing.

218
00:14:35,121 --> 00:14:36,145
- Give him to me.
- Come on...

219
00:14:36,355 --> 00:14:38,687
- He don't need to be playing.
- That's what I'm talking about.

220
00:14:38,891 --> 00:14:41,451
Every time he gets settled,
you gotta come fuck with him!

221
00:14:41,661 --> 00:14:44,630
I'm telling you, you gonna
give that little boy a twitch!

222
00:15:03,449 --> 00:15:07,249
Better go easy, girl.
Man can't be no open candy store.

223
00:15:07,453 --> 00:15:09,921
We tight this whole week.

224
00:15:10,957 --> 00:15:14,449
Put your shine on, man.
I hear this one coming.

225
00:15:18,030 --> 00:15:20,089
What's happening with you, man?

226
00:15:20,299 --> 00:15:22,733
Don't act scared, man,
she don't bite.

227
00:15:22,935 --> 00:15:25,165
She just nibbles a little bit.

228
00:15:26,472 --> 00:15:30,499
Come on... Hey, hey. Damn.

229
00:15:30,710 --> 00:15:34,043
Why can't I work the motels
anymore, D? At least they got air.

230
00:15:34,247 --> 00:15:36,272
At least they take a cut
is what they do.

231
00:15:36,682 --> 00:15:39,947
Thirty dollars an hour
on top of what we already charging,

232
00:15:40,152 --> 00:15:42,586
for what, a five-minute nut?

233
00:15:42,788 --> 00:15:44,619
Taking money out of my pocket
trying to keep

234
00:15:44,824 --> 00:15:46,121
your little country ass cool.

235
00:15:46,325 --> 00:15:46,892
God, D, all I did was ask about a motel
and you get so ugly with me.

236
00:15:46,892 --> 00:15:49,725
God, D, all I did was ask about a motel
and you get so ugly with me.

237
00:15:49,929 --> 00:15:51,988
- He's coming back.
- I'm all wet and sticky.

238
00:15:52,198 --> 00:15:53,859
You gonna have to put a show on
for this one.

239
00:15:54,066 --> 00:15:57,331
Do that little shit you do
with your tongue.

240
00:15:57,737 --> 00:16:00,103
Now, come on, he's coming back.
Get your mind right, okay?

241
00:16:00,306 --> 00:16:03,173
Come on, come on,
come on, come on. Fuck.

242
00:16:03,576 --> 00:16:05,407
Fuck, man!

243
00:16:05,611 --> 00:16:08,375
How come Lex gets to work
out of that strip club, and I can't?

244
00:16:08,581 --> 00:16:10,674
Because we done been over this
ten times, Nola.

245
00:16:10,883 --> 00:16:12,612
You got what they call
a bad equilibrium.

246
00:16:12,818 --> 00:16:15,616
And it ain't your fault,
you just knock into shit.

247
00:16:15,821 --> 00:16:17,914
I put you on that stage
in them heels,

248
00:16:18,124 --> 00:16:19,386
tricks gonna be yelling, "Timber."

249
00:16:19,592 --> 00:16:23,050
I'm in heels out here every day.
You don't see me fall down once...

250
00:16:23,262 --> 00:16:27,392
Because you sitting, Nola.
Ain't that much of a fall to the floor.

251
00:16:27,833 --> 00:16:31,234
Lookit, why don't you just let me do
the thinking for you, okay?

252
00:16:31,437 --> 00:16:34,031
You do what you do,
and you let me do what I do.

253
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:37,141
One day, you'll have to tell me
about that.

254
00:16:37,343 --> 00:16:39,072
About what?

255
00:16:40,513 --> 00:16:41,844
What the fuck it is you do.

256
00:16:44,984 --> 00:16:46,849
What did you just say to me?

257
00:16:50,890 --> 00:16:52,755
Hi, honey.

258
00:16:54,860 --> 00:16:57,852
Wanna see me walk in these heels
all the way to your lap?

259
00:16:58,998 --> 00:17:00,863
I'll be right there.

260
00:17:05,137 --> 00:17:07,901
Looks like he got air in his car, D.

261
00:17:09,275 --> 00:17:10,867
Must be working hard as you.

262
00:17:56,489 --> 00:18:00,255
Fuck you doing, man?
Doing my job? I got a mop for you.

263
00:18:00,459 --> 00:18:02,654
Elroy, I'm having me a day
that won't quit,

264
00:18:02,862 --> 00:18:06,798
so I'll need you to shed
just a little light on me, okay?

265
00:18:07,199 --> 00:18:08,928
You got something for me?

266
00:18:09,135 --> 00:18:13,401
Yeah. I got a grocery list for you too.
I need a...

267
00:18:13,606 --> 00:18:15,801
A brick of that Big Easy bud.

268
00:18:17,510 --> 00:18:19,000
What the fuck is this, man?

269
00:18:19,211 --> 00:18:22,146
Got your stank all over this.
I don't even like my own sweat, D.

270
00:18:22,348 --> 00:18:23,747
What the fuck is this?

271
00:18:25,050 --> 00:18:28,781
Okay. Let's do it this way, then.

272
00:18:29,422 --> 00:18:32,585
Let's give it some
of my sweet juices on it...

273
00:18:34,527 --> 00:18:36,927
...and tell me you ain't
gonna take that.

274
00:18:39,632 --> 00:18:41,623
You better watch yourself, D.

275
00:18:43,736 --> 00:18:45,931
Let me get you on your way.

276
00:18:48,207 --> 00:18:50,072
You cool yet?

277
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:03,347
You still into that shit, man?

278
00:19:06,459 --> 00:19:08,154
I remember Coach Rosallis
used to let you flow

279
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:10,385
over the intercom in gym class,

280
00:19:10,596 --> 00:19:13,531
back when we used to beatbox
like the Fat Boys, remember that?

281
00:19:15,534 --> 00:19:17,297
Dude, man,
we went to East Middle together.

282
00:19:17,503 --> 00:19:19,596
Clyde. Called me Key.

283
00:19:19,805 --> 00:19:22,205
- Nigga, what's up, man?
- How you feeling, man?

284
00:19:22,408 --> 00:19:25,468
Yeah, you used to spin them
little records at the after-school joints.

285
00:19:25,678 --> 00:19:28,476
Yeah, yeah. It's not like I was
scratching or nothing like that.

286
00:19:28,681 --> 00:19:31,650
I just made sure "Purple Rain"
got played for the ladies, that's all.

287
00:19:31,851 --> 00:19:34,820
- Let me get these batteries, man.
- "Purple Rain."

288
00:19:37,022 --> 00:19:39,650
Hey, give over, man. He cool. He cool.

289
00:19:39,859 --> 00:19:41,986
East Middle, man.
Them was the days, man.

290
00:19:42,194 --> 00:19:44,492
- Yeah, man.
- Them was the days.

291
00:19:44,697 --> 00:19:47,029
I see you still doing the same.

292
00:19:47,233 --> 00:19:50,031
Oh, yeah, you know,
like the post office:

293
00:19:50,236 --> 00:19:52,898
- Through rain, sleet or snow.
- You looking good, though, man.

294
00:19:53,105 --> 00:19:56,404
So, what, you got you
a dildo or something?

295
00:19:56,876 --> 00:19:58,741
A do-what?

296
00:19:58,944 --> 00:20:01,469
I mean, what's all the batteries for?

297
00:20:02,147 --> 00:20:04,138
It ain't for no dildo,
I'll tell you that right now.

298
00:20:04,350 --> 00:20:06,750
- I'm just fucking with you, man.
- Okay, okay.

299
00:20:06,952 --> 00:20:09,079
They for my microphones, man.

300
00:20:09,288 --> 00:20:11,552
- Microphones?
- Yeah.

301
00:20:12,057 --> 00:20:13,991
So, what do you do?

302
00:20:30,776 --> 00:20:34,576
I told Jesus

303
00:20:34,780 --> 00:20:39,581
It would be all right

304
00:20:39,785 --> 00:20:44,313
If he changed my name

305
00:20:50,829 --> 00:20:55,061
I told Jesus

306
00:20:55,267 --> 00:21:00,227
It would be all right

307
00:21:00,439 --> 00:21:04,899
If he changed my name

308
00:21:11,083 --> 00:21:15,019
I told Jesus

309
00:21:15,220 --> 00:21:20,283
It would be all right

310
00:21:20,492 --> 00:21:26,829
If he changed

311
00:21:28,334 --> 00:21:33,067
My name

312
00:21:47,219 --> 00:21:50,780
- Jesus told me
- Jesus

313
00:21:51,490 --> 00:21:56,189
That the world would be against me

314
00:21:56,395 --> 00:22:04,359
- If he changed
- Changed my

315
00:22:04,570 --> 00:22:10,008
My

316
00:22:14,580 --> 00:22:18,710
Name

317
00:22:29,228 --> 00:22:32,720
Hey, Shug. Shug.

318
00:22:33,298 --> 00:22:34,822
Wake up.

319
00:22:37,503 --> 00:22:39,266
What, I gotta watch the baby?

320
00:22:39,471 --> 00:22:41,666
No, everybody asleep.

321
00:22:46,679 --> 00:22:50,137
- So he kicking now, huh?
- Usually after I eat.

322
00:22:50,349 --> 00:22:53,375
He real active
during the day, though.

323
00:22:53,585 --> 00:22:57,248
He must get that after his daddy.
He sure don't get that from me.

324
00:22:58,424 --> 00:22:59,789
Whoever that is, huh?

325
00:23:03,462 --> 00:23:07,296
You know, Shug,
you and me, we got history, right?

326
00:23:08,267 --> 00:23:13,330
I mean, you been tricking for me
for a few now, so we got that, right?

327
00:23:14,773 --> 00:23:18,869
And me not pimping you
because of...

328
00:23:19,078 --> 00:23:21,137
...your demonstration,

329
00:23:21,346 --> 00:23:23,746
it just puts us in a whole...

330
00:23:28,921 --> 00:23:31,082
...different kind of place,
you know what I mean?

331
00:23:32,257 --> 00:23:33,918
You want me to leave.

332
00:23:37,029 --> 00:23:38,087
Hell, no.

333
00:23:39,064 --> 00:23:41,328
Why would you say
something like that?

334
00:23:44,737 --> 00:23:46,932
I just feel like...

335
00:23:47,406 --> 00:23:51,809
Like I'm having one of them
midlife crisis, you know?

336
00:23:55,214 --> 00:23:57,546
I mean, my daddy...

337
00:23:58,550 --> 00:24:01,815
...you know, his heart
gave out on him when he was, like...

338
00:24:03,455 --> 00:24:06,117
Well, shit, when I was 12 years old.

339
00:24:06,325 --> 00:24:08,020
Shit, he was my age.

340
00:24:08,527 --> 00:24:10,017
And that shit just been...

341
00:24:10,229 --> 00:24:13,426
Just been fucking
with my mind, you know?

342
00:24:14,333 --> 00:24:17,302
It got me feeling
like this is it for me.

343
00:24:20,539 --> 00:24:24,202
I just don't know what
I'm supposed... Supposed to do.

344
00:24:28,247 --> 00:24:30,807
I get bad dreams.

345
00:24:31,450 --> 00:24:35,352
Dreams like me giving birth
to dead dogs.

346
00:24:36,054 --> 00:24:39,546
Sometimes I'm breast-feeding
a big old ugly catfish.

347
00:24:40,826 --> 00:24:43,021
- For real?
- Yeah.

348
00:24:43,228 --> 00:24:47,358
But that's just my mind

349
00:24:47,566 --> 00:24:50,933
touching in on something
I ain't said yet.

350
00:24:52,204 --> 00:24:53,762
What's that?

351
00:25:01,847 --> 00:25:03,280
I'm scared, D.

352
00:25:06,418 --> 00:25:09,012
Sometimes I just get so scared...

353
00:25:20,465 --> 00:25:22,524
Most gracious and heavenly Father,
we pray that you

354
00:25:22,734 --> 00:25:25,601
bless this food and this house
in Jesus' name. Amen.

355
00:25:26,205 --> 00:25:28,070
Amen.

356
00:25:28,273 --> 00:25:30,707
So Beth Ann tells me

357
00:25:30,909 --> 00:25:33,537
the reason I didn't
get that sales-supervisor position

358
00:25:33,745 --> 00:25:35,736
is because she says I have issues

359
00:25:35,948 --> 00:25:38,746
enforcing company policy
with my coworkers,

360
00:25:38,951 --> 00:25:41,078
who, by the way,
she referred to as my friends.

361
00:25:41,753 --> 00:25:43,687
Not "coworkers," mind you,
but "friends."

362
00:25:43,889 --> 00:25:46,153
And I said to her,
"Hey, just because I am pleasant

363
00:25:46,358 --> 00:25:49,259
and supportive does not mean
that I cannot crack a whip."

364
00:25:49,461 --> 00:25:50,951
Because, you know,
I can crack a whip.

365
00:25:51,797 --> 00:25:52,821
Yeah, you can, baby.

366
00:25:53,031 --> 00:25:55,625
Because what we talking about here,
huh? Folding some sweaters?

367
00:25:55,834 --> 00:25:58,325
Shoot, sales supervisors
don't even handle the safe.

368
00:25:58,537 --> 00:26:02,064
So I go in and I talk to Leonard.
Because he always talking about,

369
00:26:02,274 --> 00:26:04,333
"Come in and air your grievances,"
right? So I did.

370
00:26:04,543 --> 00:26:06,443
- What did he say?
- You know what he says to me?

371
00:26:06,645 --> 00:26:10,411
He says I am incapable of writing
somebody up because I'm so friendly.

372
00:26:10,616 --> 00:26:13,881
And I said,
"Hey, give me a pen, Leonard, okay?

373
00:26:14,086 --> 00:26:16,418
I'll tell you everything
that everybody's doing wrong."

374
00:26:16,622 --> 00:26:20,023
What, Beth Ann, she take
way too long on her lunch break.

375
00:26:20,225 --> 00:26:24,491
Alan, that little shit down in Receiving
came to work the other day high.

376
00:26:24,696 --> 00:26:28,291
And Sally, just yesterday, came in with
this skirt with the discontinued line.

377
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:31,094
Remember that, baby?
Remember that little skirt I had?

378
00:26:31,303 --> 00:26:33,271
And I know she didn't pay for it.

379
00:26:33,472 --> 00:26:36,930
He think I'm gonna take some kind of
blind eye to all of these violations

380
00:26:37,142 --> 00:26:40,634
if I was sales supervisor
just because I'm nice?

381
00:26:44,049 --> 00:26:45,277
Clyde?

382
00:26:56,261 --> 00:26:58,821
- Damn.
- What the hell you doing here, Djay?

383
00:26:59,031 --> 00:27:03,730
Hey, look here, baby. I know you about
sick and tired of seeing me right now,

384
00:27:03,936 --> 00:27:07,702
- but I just wanted to be able...
- Clyde. Who is it?

385
00:27:12,177 --> 00:27:15,635
- It's just...
- Just an old school buddy, ma'am.

386
00:27:15,847 --> 00:27:19,544
- From back in the day.
- Well, we was just having dinner.

387
00:27:19,751 --> 00:27:22,686
I'm so sorry, y'all. And I'd have
left them in the car,

388
00:27:22,888 --> 00:27:24,685
but this one right here, man,
she just

389
00:27:24,890 --> 00:27:27,381
sniff out an air-conditioning unit
like an old bloodhound bitch.

390
00:27:27,592 --> 00:27:30,755
Hey. Hey, man, respect my house.

391
00:27:30,963 --> 00:27:33,124
Look, man, anyplace you and me

392
00:27:33,332 --> 00:27:36,096
could just sit down
and talk for a minute?

393
00:27:36,301 --> 00:27:38,326
Djay, things don't always
come together

394
00:27:38,537 --> 00:27:41,165
just because you want them to,
all right, man?

395
00:27:41,373 --> 00:27:43,637
Look, just because you got the bacon,
the lettuce and tomato,

396
00:27:43,842 --> 00:27:47,107
hell, man, that don't mean
I'm gonna give you my toast.

397
00:27:47,612 --> 00:27:50,012
Look, man, I know you done learned
a whole mess of shit

398
00:27:50,215 --> 00:27:52,513
hustling out on the street, right?

399
00:27:52,951 --> 00:27:55,511
Let me tell you what I learned
while working on my job.

400
00:27:55,721 --> 00:27:58,246
- Thank you.
- There are two types of people:

401
00:27:58,457 --> 00:28:01,984
Those that talk the talk
and those that walk the walk.

402
00:28:02,194 --> 00:28:06,324
People who walk the walk,
they sometimes talk the talk.

403
00:28:06,531 --> 00:28:09,796
But most of the time, they don't
talk at all, because they walking.

404
00:28:10,736 --> 00:28:14,467
Now, people who talk the talk,
when it comes time for them to walk,

405
00:28:14,673 --> 00:28:17,107
- you wanna know what they do?
- What is that?

406
00:28:17,309 --> 00:28:19,300
They talk people like me
into walking for them.

407
00:28:19,511 --> 00:28:21,911
Look, I'm just asking you...

408
00:28:22,781 --> 00:28:26,649
Just listen to what I got here,
man, all right? Just listen to it.

409
00:28:26,852 --> 00:28:31,414
And if you ain't... If you ain't feeling it,
man, I'm out your life, okay?

410
00:28:41,666 --> 00:28:43,759
So can I get y'all anything?

411
00:28:45,470 --> 00:28:47,097
No, ma'am.

412
00:28:48,774 --> 00:28:51,208
Hey, I really like your hair.

413
00:28:51,610 --> 00:28:54,545
It's got some, like,
chocolate colors in it.

414
00:28:54,746 --> 00:28:56,805
Oh, thank you.

415
00:28:57,015 --> 00:28:59,506
I have this great guy that does it
over in Germantown,

416
00:28:59,718 --> 00:29:01,515
the coloring.

417
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:03,779
- That sound all right.
- The whole time it's gonna have

418
00:29:03,989 --> 00:29:05,251
this thing going like:

419
00:29:08,827 --> 00:29:10,852
- Then I come in...
- When you gonna start a rhyme?

420
00:29:11,063 --> 00:29:14,430
Just gotta get my mode on, man,
just give me a second. All right.

421
00:29:14,633 --> 00:29:18,501
These bitches pop it for some paper
Pop that ass for some cash flow

422
00:29:18,703 --> 00:29:21,866
Do it like I like it
And I give you what you ask for

423
00:29:22,074 --> 00:29:23,701
I try and do my hair
every couple of months

424
00:29:23,909 --> 00:29:26,434
because it keeps the tricks guessing.

425
00:29:26,645 --> 00:29:28,806
- You know?
- I'm sorry, keep the what?

426
00:29:29,347 --> 00:29:31,508
Well, my hair has to be redone a lot

427
00:29:32,050 --> 00:29:34,917
because these ain't me real braids,
these just extensions.

428
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:39,113
Nola, would you just
shut the fuck up, please?

429
00:29:39,324 --> 00:29:42,816
What makes you think this lady
care about your kitchen-ass hairdo?

430
00:29:43,028 --> 00:29:46,191
I think, you know what, it's nice.
It's okay...

431
00:29:46,398 --> 00:29:49,890
Lady, you don't got to be nice to her
because she's sitting on your couch.

432
00:29:50,102 --> 00:29:54,004
You think her hair look like a wet
dust mop, go on and tell her so. I do.

433
00:29:54,206 --> 00:29:57,004
- Damn, Lex.
- Well, I didn't. I mean, I don't.

434
00:29:57,209 --> 00:29:58,870
Lex, why you gotta be so ugly?

435
00:29:59,077 --> 00:30:01,375
Get a nigga minx
Grab her by the hand

436
00:30:01,580 --> 00:30:04,743
Take her back for some convo
Drop a couple grams

437
00:30:04,950 --> 00:30:06,884
Now you're back at the condo

438
00:30:07,085 --> 00:30:09,645
- Ugly as a swamp-duck ho.
- God!

439
00:30:09,855 --> 00:30:11,982
Everybody else
says my hair looks sexy.

440
00:30:12,324 --> 00:30:14,451
And then they nut.

441
00:30:16,761 --> 00:30:18,353
Clyde?

442
00:30:18,964 --> 00:30:20,454
Clyde?

443
00:30:21,133 --> 00:30:23,328
Real fast
Shake it, shake it real fast

444
00:30:23,535 --> 00:30:26,663
Put your hands on your knees
Shake it, shake it real fast

445
00:30:26,872 --> 00:30:30,308
Shake it, shake it real fast
Shake it, shake it real fast

446
00:30:30,509 --> 00:30:33,000
- What's up, nigga, you run out of spit?
- No, man, I just...

447
00:30:33,211 --> 00:30:34,644
Clyde!

448
00:30:38,216 --> 00:30:40,047
What are you doing?

449
00:30:44,556 --> 00:30:46,114
Walking.

450
00:30:58,270 --> 00:31:01,967
I see you're down with that next nigga
Tryin' to make your chest bigger

451
00:31:02,174 --> 00:31:05,575
See you're down with that next nigga
Tryin' to make your chest bigger

452
00:31:05,777 --> 00:31:09,907
Working on your flex
Figure what? Nigga, fuck that shit

453
00:31:12,217 --> 00:31:14,549
Let's get this to work, Djay.

454
00:31:31,770 --> 00:31:34,136
The roadblock

455
00:31:34,339 --> 00:31:37,672
Got niggas jumpin' up
Tryin' to move the rock

456
00:31:37,876 --> 00:31:42,040
It's like all my days, I've been
hearing this beat in my head, man,

457
00:31:42,247 --> 00:31:44,442
like a pounding.
I mean, sometimes it's real raw,

458
00:31:44,649 --> 00:31:48,244
like a eightball joint, but then
sometimes, man, it get real soft,

459
00:31:48,453 --> 00:31:50,250
like Otis Redding and shit, man.

460
00:31:50,455 --> 00:31:52,355
And this beat, this pounding, man,

461
00:31:52,557 --> 00:31:57,654
that's what I been calling my mode,
this feeling. And, Key, if my mode

462
00:31:57,862 --> 00:32:00,626
is cracking, man,
it's like I can't be stopped, man.

463
00:32:00,832 --> 00:32:03,323
It's like I'm Mike, and it's showtime.

464
00:32:03,535 --> 00:32:05,969
Nigga, it's on, you know what I mean?
You know?

465
00:32:06,171 --> 00:32:07,934
Because, shit, when I'm out here
on this track,

466
00:32:08,139 --> 00:32:10,198
I gotta keep my game tight, man.

467
00:32:10,408 --> 00:32:13,866
Because it's hard out here
for a pimp, man. For real, man.

468
00:32:14,446 --> 00:32:17,074
Hold on, I like that, man.

469
00:32:18,350 --> 00:32:20,318
"It's hard out here for a pimp."

470
00:32:23,188 --> 00:32:25,986
Hot 107. 1. Big up to South Memphis
out there, checking in.

471
00:32:26,191 --> 00:32:28,159
I got your requests, and I got
that coming up for you.

472
00:32:28,360 --> 00:32:29,452
Keep your radios locked.

473
00:32:29,661 --> 00:32:31,754
This is messing with my mode.

474
00:32:34,165 --> 00:32:36,963
This is a bunch of bullshit, man.

475
00:32:37,736 --> 00:32:41,536
This is all I got
So I keeps it hot

476
00:32:42,274 --> 00:32:45,835
How I'm supposed to not?
Read your post to plot

477
00:32:46,044 --> 00:32:48,308
"Read your post to plot."

478
00:32:56,221 --> 00:32:58,485
Baby, this is some hard shit
right here.

479
00:32:58,690 --> 00:33:01,818
Trying to take what's
in your head, man,

480
00:33:02,027 --> 00:33:05,656
and put it into words that fit together
like a puzzle.

481
00:33:06,298 --> 00:33:07,697
So, you know...

482
00:33:07,899 --> 00:33:10,993
I wish there was something
I could do.

483
00:33:11,303 --> 00:33:13,601
You know, just...

484
00:33:14,372 --> 00:33:17,705
Shit, baby, you my whole operation.

485
00:33:18,677 --> 00:33:21,305
You might be what they call a...

486
00:33:22,013 --> 00:33:25,005
Like, a primary investor, you know?

487
00:33:25,216 --> 00:33:28,777
Making this shit happen
one trick at a time.

488
00:33:33,558 --> 00:33:36,755
- Hey, Nola.
- What?

489
00:33:37,996 --> 00:33:39,463
Remember when I first met you?

490
00:33:40,231 --> 00:33:44,759
Right where I found you at?
Remember, you was at the truck stop?

491
00:33:45,136 --> 00:33:48,731
Smallest little lot lizard I'd ever seen,
tricking them truckers for change.

492
00:33:48,940 --> 00:33:52,637
But you had balls, man.
Big gorilla balls.

493
00:33:53,745 --> 00:33:56,213
I got love for you, Nola.

494
00:33:57,315 --> 00:33:59,283
Big love.

495
00:33:59,818 --> 00:34:03,310
And I ain't talking about a way a man
love a woman or nothing like that.

496
00:34:03,521 --> 00:34:06,422
I'm talking about like a brother.

497
00:34:07,692 --> 00:34:09,557
Hey, do me a favor.

498
00:34:09,761 --> 00:34:12,457
I want you to put your hands
right here. Both of them.

499
00:34:18,603 --> 00:34:21,401
Now, I'm gonna put
my hands here too.

500
00:34:21,606 --> 00:34:23,972
Know what this means?

501
00:34:24,576 --> 00:34:26,271
What?

502
00:34:26,578 --> 00:34:28,978
It means we in charge.

503
00:34:30,548 --> 00:34:34,678
It means we got our hands
on the wheel. We in charge.

504
00:34:34,886 --> 00:34:37,821
Not them tricks out there, man.

505
00:34:38,022 --> 00:34:40,115
We in charge.

506
00:34:41,359 --> 00:34:43,725
I wanna hear you say it...

507
00:34:44,229 --> 00:34:47,630
...so I can believe in you
the same way you believe in me.

508
00:34:49,567 --> 00:34:51,626
We in charge.

509
00:34:52,237 --> 00:34:56,196
That's the best you can do?
Say it like you mean it.

510
00:34:57,342 --> 00:34:59,503
We in charge.

511
00:35:00,578 --> 00:35:01,943
You said you was all right with this.

512
00:35:02,313 --> 00:35:04,543
It's what you wanna hear, right?
So let's just drop it.

513
00:35:04,749 --> 00:35:07,343
No, Yevette.
I wanna hear what you really think.

514
00:35:07,552 --> 00:35:09,782
- No, you don't.
- Yes, I do.

515
00:35:09,988 --> 00:35:11,148
You say that,

516
00:35:11,356 --> 00:35:13,984
but I know you wanna hear what you
want, so that's what I'm gonna say.

517
00:35:14,192 --> 00:35:16,490
I'm sick and tired of people telling me
what I'm thinking,

518
00:35:16,694 --> 00:35:18,127
like I don't know my
own goddamned mind.

519
00:35:18,329 --> 00:35:20,320
Don't you dare take that tone
with me, Clyde, okay?

520
00:35:20,532 --> 00:35:23,057
- I have supported you in everything...
- We already discussed this!

521
00:35:23,268 --> 00:35:25,930
All right, fine! I'm thrilled!
Okay? Thrilled.

522
00:35:26,137 --> 00:35:28,264
What woman wouldn't want
her husband spending all his time

523
00:35:28,473 --> 00:35:30,737
in a house full of ho's?

524
00:35:39,584 --> 00:35:41,848
What's all this shit again?

525
00:35:42,387 --> 00:35:46,585
Drink holders.
Poor man's soundproofing.

526
00:35:48,126 --> 00:35:50,458
So you ain't so dumb, huh?

527
00:35:52,564 --> 00:35:54,031
- D?
- What?

528
00:35:54,232 --> 00:35:56,826
There's someone at the door for you.

529
00:35:57,035 --> 00:35:59,128
Well, shit, baby, you know my rates.

530
00:36:00,438 --> 00:36:04,272
- I don't think he want no weed.
- Then wake Nola's ass up.

531
00:36:05,477 --> 00:36:07,707
- I don't think he want that either.
- Shit, man.

532
00:36:07,979 --> 00:36:10,243
We have to come up with some
fucking rules in this house!

533
00:36:10,448 --> 00:36:13,212
- Well, if you just tell me not to
- I wanna put a red light bulb up there

534
00:36:13,418 --> 00:36:15,886
- answer the door, that's fine with me.
- To say I'm working.

535
00:36:16,087 --> 00:36:18,021
- It ain't for me!
- Every time I'm fucking working,

536
00:36:18,223 --> 00:36:20,350
y'all come and bothering me.

537
00:36:20,558 --> 00:36:22,389
Hey, man.

538
00:36:26,531 --> 00:36:29,523
You Mormons is some
brave motherfuckers.

539
00:36:30,368 --> 00:36:32,461
No, I'm Shelby.

540
00:36:32,670 --> 00:36:34,968
Okay, you Shelby.

541
00:36:35,874 --> 00:36:37,865
All right, look.
Hey, turntable's set up,

542
00:36:38,076 --> 00:36:41,011
and the mixer that D got
has room for four inputs.

543
00:36:41,212 --> 00:36:44,238
- Cool. You got a power strip?
- Oh, we tight.

544
00:36:44,449 --> 00:36:46,280
How many outlets you need?

545
00:36:47,018 --> 00:36:50,385
- Three. I brought my MPC.
- Smart move.

546
00:36:50,588 --> 00:36:52,351
Hey, Key.

547
00:36:53,224 --> 00:36:55,920
Let me holler at you
for a second, man.

548
00:36:57,695 --> 00:37:00,528
- What's up, man?
- Who the fuck is this nigga, man?

549
00:37:00,732 --> 00:37:02,893
That's Shelby. He play piano
down in my church.

550
00:37:03,101 --> 00:37:07,128
You know, I figure we bring him in,
help him develop our sound.

551
00:37:08,606 --> 00:37:10,733
You know he white, right?

552
00:37:11,509 --> 00:37:14,273
No, he just light-skinned.

553
00:37:17,081 --> 00:37:19,311
Yo, peep. I got this shit right here
that...

554
00:37:19,517 --> 00:37:25,945
I keep this notepad
so that I can just jot down some shit.

555
00:37:26,591 --> 00:37:28,388
It's something...

556
00:37:30,662 --> 00:37:32,630
Get the fuck out of here, man.

557
00:37:36,267 --> 00:37:38,462
It go like this, man.

558
00:37:38,803 --> 00:37:41,772
Y'all sure y'all don't wanna, like,
burn one first, man?

559
00:37:41,973 --> 00:37:46,501
No, man. We can toke up later.
Let's hear what you got.

560
00:37:46,878 --> 00:37:50,279
Fine, man. I got...

561
00:37:51,282 --> 00:37:52,772
Okay.

562
00:37:56,421 --> 00:37:59,356
I bet you won't beat that bitch
Whoop that bitch

563
00:37:59,557 --> 00:38:03,618
Got me acting buck and shit
Ho's telling me to calm down

564
00:38:03,828 --> 00:38:05,022
But I'm like, "Fuck that shit"

565
00:38:05,229 --> 00:38:08,756
I'm already on that Hpnotiq
And that Grey Goose

566
00:38:08,967 --> 00:38:11,868
A couple of shots of Hen
That just gave me a...

567
00:38:12,070 --> 00:38:13,765
What the fuck wrong?
You don't like that shit?

568
00:38:13,972 --> 00:38:16,497
- No, D, look.
- I got other shit, man.

569
00:38:16,708 --> 00:38:20,371
- No, look... It's okay, man.
- I think that's tight.

570
00:38:21,079 --> 00:38:22,910
It's just that we want radio play, right?

571
00:38:23,114 --> 00:38:25,446
You got a song called
"Beat That Bitch,"

572
00:38:25,650 --> 00:38:27,447
they might hear that
and think that's degrading.

573
00:38:27,652 --> 00:38:29,347
But that's if you're calling
a woman a bitch.

574
00:38:29,554 --> 00:38:31,351
This sounds like a
tearing-the-club-up song.

575
00:38:31,556 --> 00:38:33,319
Man, I ain't trying to call no ho
no bitch.

576
00:38:33,524 --> 00:38:35,822
Yeah, I mean, besides,
most of the bitches I know are guys.

577
00:38:36,027 --> 00:38:37,892
Look, man, y'all preaching to the choir,
all right?

578
00:38:38,096 --> 00:38:40,758
If you had to say something different,
other than "beat that bitch,"

579
00:38:40,999 --> 00:38:42,296
what would you say?

580
00:38:42,500 --> 00:38:45,992
I don't know. Shit. Stuff like...

581
00:38:46,571 --> 00:38:48,698
"Stomp that ho."

582
00:38:48,906 --> 00:38:50,533
- Who gonna play that?
- Fuck.

583
00:38:51,643 --> 00:38:54,168
- Shit, "whoop that trick."
- No, no, no.

584
00:38:54,379 --> 00:38:55,403
- Go back.
- What?

585
00:38:55,613 --> 00:38:57,308
- "Whoop that trick."
- That's it.

586
00:38:58,883 --> 00:39:01,147
- Like what?
- Like a chant, man.

587
00:39:01,352 --> 00:39:03,320
- Whoop that trick
- Whoop that trick?

588
00:39:03,521 --> 00:39:04,818
Get 'em

589
00:39:05,023 --> 00:39:06,752
Whoop that trick
Get 'em

590
00:39:06,958 --> 00:39:08,585
Whoop that trick
Get 'em

591
00:39:08,793 --> 00:39:10,522
Whoop that trick
Get 'em

592
00:39:10,728 --> 00:39:12,161
Whoop that trick
Get 'em

593
00:39:12,363 --> 00:39:13,887
Oh, shit, man, yeah.

594
00:39:14,098 --> 00:39:15,656
Get 'em
Whoop that trick

595
00:39:15,867 --> 00:39:17,858
Get 'em
Whoop that trick

596
00:39:18,069 --> 00:39:19,468
Get 'em
Whoop that trick

597
00:39:19,671 --> 00:39:22,139
Get 'em
Whoop that trick

598
00:39:26,077 --> 00:39:28,443
Come on, Shel, find it, man. Find it.

599
00:39:32,417 --> 00:39:34,783
Speed it up. Speed it up.

600
00:39:36,788 --> 00:39:37,914
There you go.

601
00:39:43,828 --> 00:39:45,887
I like that clap.

602
00:39:57,942 --> 00:40:00,069
Not bad to be light-skinned, huh?

603
00:40:12,824 --> 00:40:14,485
- Whoop that trick
- Get 'em

604
00:40:14,692 --> 00:40:15,989
- Whoop that trick

Okay, let's go smoke that joint.

644
00:42:12,543 --> 00:42:15,068
It's nice to have company, huh?

645
00:42:16,948 --> 00:42:19,109
Thank you.

646
00:42:22,353 --> 00:42:24,583
See, the thing is...

647
00:42:25,356 --> 00:42:29,417
And I believe this, man... . Rap is
coming back home to the South.

648
00:42:29,627 --> 00:42:31,026
- Yeah, man.
- Because this, man...

649
00:42:31,229 --> 00:42:33,129
This is where it all began.

650
00:42:33,331 --> 00:42:37,529
Heavy percussion, repetitive hooks,
sexually suggestive lyrics.

651
00:42:37,735 --> 00:42:40,101
Man, it's all blues, brother.

652
00:42:40,304 --> 00:42:42,534
"Back Door Man" to
"Back That Ass Up."

653
00:42:42,740 --> 00:42:47,006
It's all about pain and...
And pussy.

654
00:42:47,211 --> 00:42:50,476
Sorry, baby. And making music, man.

655
00:42:50,948 --> 00:42:54,179
With simple tools,
by any means necessary.

656
00:42:54,385 --> 00:42:58,754
You've got to get what you got to say
out because you got to.

657
00:42:58,956 --> 00:43:00,685
Every man, you know
what I'm saying?

658
00:43:00,892 --> 00:43:06,728
Every man has the right,
the goddamn right...

659
00:43:08,266 --> 00:43:09,927
...to contribute a verse.

660
00:43:13,170 --> 00:43:15,638
- Number one for hip-hop. This
your man Boogaloo in the house.

661
00:43:15,840 --> 00:43:17,171
North Memphis,
throw your thumbs up.

662
00:43:17,375 --> 00:43:18,899
South Memphis,
let's get ready to kick it.

663
00:43:19,110 --> 00:43:20,975
I got this hot joint from my man,
Al Kapone.

664
00:43:21,178 --> 00:43:22,668
"Get Crunk, Get Buck." It's hot.

665
00:43:56,814 --> 00:44:00,773
- Do you just do music?
- Hey, man.

666
00:44:02,687 --> 00:44:06,179
Do you got, like, a regular kind of job,
a day job?

667
00:44:06,390 --> 00:44:09,291
Yeah, I got a job.
I restock vending machines.

668
00:44:09,493 --> 00:44:10,721
- Really?
- Yeah, you know,

669
00:44:10,928 --> 00:44:14,091
soda, candy, microwave popcorn.
All that shit.

670
00:44:14,298 --> 00:44:16,129
- That's cool.
- No, it's not cool.

671
00:44:16,334 --> 00:44:17,892
- Why?
- Because

672
00:44:18,102 --> 00:44:20,798
I gotta get up every day
at the crack

673
00:44:21,005 --> 00:44:23,303
and head out to all the truck stops
on the interstate

674
00:44:23,507 --> 00:44:25,099
before I head to the high schools.

675
00:44:25,309 --> 00:44:27,243
Yeah, I'm alone all day,

676
00:44:27,445 --> 00:44:32,075
and I smell like...
Like sticky buns and Skittles.

677
00:44:33,918 --> 00:44:36,250
I thought my job sucked, but...

678
00:44:42,760 --> 00:44:44,660
Hey, man.

679
00:44:45,196 --> 00:44:48,563
So this Skinny Black shit, that's real?

680
00:44:49,266 --> 00:44:51,791
Look, man, because even if he
does listen to what we got, man,

681
00:44:52,003 --> 00:44:54,369
we still don't know what he gonna do,
you know what I mean?

682
00:44:54,939 --> 00:44:56,406
It's a one-in-a-million shot, D.

683
00:44:56,607 --> 00:45:01,374
If I can pimp $20 ho's out the back
of this motherfucking Chevy,

684
00:45:01,579 --> 00:45:02,944
I can pimp Skinny.

685
00:45:03,748 --> 00:45:06,148
Nigga, you just get me
where I gotta be at.

686
00:45:06,350 --> 00:45:08,443
I'm telling you, this dog got him
some tricks, man.

687
00:45:08,953 --> 00:45:12,889
- You mean "old dog," right?
- I didn't mean it like that, man.

688
00:45:18,029 --> 00:45:20,691
My wife, man, she a...

689
00:45:21,632 --> 00:45:23,532
She a good woman.

690
00:45:25,803 --> 00:45:27,634
She feeds me.

691
00:45:27,972 --> 00:45:30,634
She get freaky on my birthday.

692
00:45:31,142 --> 00:45:33,975
- What she do?
- None of your business.

693
00:45:34,178 --> 00:45:37,113
But sometimes I feel, man, like...

694
00:45:38,649 --> 00:45:42,585
Like I talked such a good game
when we was young, man,

695
00:45:42,787 --> 00:45:46,245
about my own studio
and my own label that...

696
00:45:47,792 --> 00:45:50,784
Shit, Djay,
now I'm just paying rent, man.

697
00:45:55,232 --> 00:45:57,860
This shit right here, it gotta work.

698
00:45:59,403 --> 00:46:02,463
It gotta work, man,
because it ain't over for me.

699
00:46:16,020 --> 00:46:20,650
I am so sick and tired of you trying
to tell me what to do with my boy.

700
00:46:21,092 --> 00:46:24,152
That's my son! You go on and
have your little baby, then you can do

701
00:46:24,361 --> 00:46:25,988
- whatever you want!
- Lex, stop yelling.

702
00:46:26,197 --> 00:46:30,031
My pussy paid for this.
I should be mad.

703
00:46:31,135 --> 00:46:34,502
Lookie, lookie, who just decided
to waltz on in.

704
00:46:34,705 --> 00:46:37,071
Where the hell you been at, Djay?

705
00:46:37,274 --> 00:46:40,038
You know, I been standing outside
three hours.

706
00:46:40,244 --> 00:46:42,678
Finally just went on ahead,
took myself a taxi ride.

707
00:46:42,880 --> 00:46:44,074
Spent up all my little monies.

708
00:46:44,281 --> 00:46:47,682
So I really hope you ain't expecting
shit from me today!

709
00:46:50,454 --> 00:46:53,184
- Right back to your toys.
- You should go.

710
00:46:53,390 --> 00:46:55,950
You know what, Djay?

711
00:46:56,160 --> 00:46:59,994
You ain't never gonna be nothing more
than what you is right now,

712
00:47:00,197 --> 00:47:02,529
and that's my motherfucking
chauffeur.

713
00:47:04,068 --> 00:47:06,366
I make the money up in here.

714
00:47:06,570 --> 00:47:08,697
Know what? Matter of fact,
I think I feel like

715
00:47:08,906 --> 00:47:11,067
making me some money right now.

716
00:47:11,275 --> 00:47:16,212
Feel like popping my pussy,
maybe shaking my ass.

717
00:47:16,714 --> 00:47:20,741
Go on, boy. Go on, get my car for me.

718
00:47:20,951 --> 00:47:24,114
You heard me. Go on, now, little bitch.

719
00:47:25,789 --> 00:47:27,950
- What the fuck you just say to me?
- That's right, keep...

720
00:47:28,159 --> 00:47:31,788
- What the fuck you call me?
- Called you a motherfucking bitch!

721
00:47:31,996 --> 00:47:35,397
Now, do something about it, damn it!
Do something!

722
00:47:41,839 --> 00:47:43,670
You and me...

723
00:47:44,842 --> 00:47:47,072
...we done, okay?

724
00:47:48,245 --> 00:47:49,974
We done.

725
00:47:50,548 --> 00:47:52,345
You know what?

726
00:47:53,617 --> 00:47:56,313
We been done.

727
00:47:58,088 --> 00:48:01,785
And there you go,
running off to your little toys.

728
00:48:01,992 --> 00:48:04,552
Because you ain't nothing
but a little punk-ass bitch!

729
00:48:04,762 --> 00:48:08,721
- Lex, please back off.
- Just shut the fuck up!

730
00:48:08,933 --> 00:48:12,926
Wasted five years of my damn life
working in this piece-of-shit hole.

731
00:48:13,137 --> 00:48:15,332
So, what now? That's my shit!

732
00:48:15,539 --> 00:48:17,632
What, you just gonna
throw my stuff out?

733
00:48:17,841 --> 00:48:22,938
Oh, out the door! Hey, Djay!
You just leave my shit alone!

734
00:48:23,147 --> 00:48:26,844
I paid for that...
No! No! No!

735
00:48:27,051 --> 00:48:29,246
- I paid for this shit!
- Fuck! Come here.

736
00:48:29,620 --> 00:48:31,178
- Now!
- Djay, no!

737
00:48:32,223 --> 00:48:36,284
- Get the fuck off me! Get off me!
- No! No! Djay, no!

738
00:48:36,660 --> 00:48:38,491
Talk now!

739
00:48:39,830 --> 00:48:42,594
- Hey. Hey, come here.
- No, please, D.

740
00:48:42,800 --> 00:48:45,462
Let go. Let go.

741
00:48:47,004 --> 00:48:49,165
Come on. Come on.

742
00:48:54,712 --> 00:48:57,374
Where in the fuck do you
expect me to go?

743
00:48:59,483 --> 00:49:02,782
You can go to hell, all I give a fuck.

744
00:49:20,738 --> 00:49:23,536
Y'all make him pay!

745
00:50:42,386 --> 00:50:45,048
All right, man.
This is what I got so far.

746
00:50:46,957 --> 00:50:49,653
Man, it seems like I'm duckin'
Dodgin' bullets every day

747
00:50:49,860 --> 00:50:52,795
Niggas hatin' on me
'Cause I got ho's on the blade

748
00:50:52,996 --> 00:50:55,760
But I gotta stay paid
Gotta stay above water

749
00:50:55,966 --> 00:50:58,662
Couldn't keep up with my ho's
That's when shit got harder

750
00:50:58,869 --> 00:51:01,702
North Memphis, where I'm from
I'm Seventh Street bound

751
00:51:01,905 --> 00:51:04,703
Where niggas all the time
End up lost and never found

752
00:51:04,908 --> 00:51:07,877
These gals take me through things
Leave a big headache

753
00:51:08,078 --> 00:51:10,239
I'm hopin' every night
They don't end up being dead weight

754
00:51:10,447 --> 00:51:15,111
Hold on. Hold on, one second.
My bad.

755
00:51:15,319 --> 00:51:16,980
Baby.

756
00:51:17,187 --> 00:51:19,815
Look, I'm in a session right now,
all right?

757
00:51:20,023 --> 00:51:22,958
- What time you coming home?
- I can't give you that time.

758
00:51:23,160 --> 00:51:24,991
If I give it to you,
you're gonna hold me to that.

759
00:51:25,195 --> 00:51:28,631
- I don't see why you can't give a time.
- Because I'm not gonna do it.

760
00:51:29,666 --> 00:51:31,964
L... Look...

761
00:51:32,169 --> 00:51:35,605
If you just let me talk, I can be able
to tell you that I can't do it...

762
00:51:35,806 --> 00:51:38,400
Because I said so, that's why!

763
00:51:41,111 --> 00:51:43,511
You ready to work, lover-boy?

764
00:51:49,486 --> 00:51:53,013
Hey, Shelby,
bring that beat back, man.

765
00:51:53,223 --> 00:51:54,952
From the top.

766
00:51:55,926 --> 00:51:57,223
You know what? Just kill it.

767
00:51:57,428 --> 00:51:59,658
Fuck, man.
I got this flow I need to spit.

768
00:51:59,863 --> 00:52:01,854
Look, look, Djay.

769
00:52:02,132 --> 00:52:03,724
Now, we gonna have to make
a choice, man.

770
00:52:03,934 --> 00:52:06,368
Either we just gonna lay down
some freestyle freefall,

771
00:52:06,570 --> 00:52:08,060
or we gonna lay down a track.

772
00:52:08,272 --> 00:52:10,365
You know, something that's gonna
get us some radio play.

773
00:52:10,574 --> 00:52:12,633
I thought that's what we was doing
right here.

774
00:52:12,843 --> 00:52:15,209
No, no, no. What we doing
is a whole bunch of flow.

775
00:52:15,412 --> 00:52:18,438
That's all we doing.
And it just go on and on and on.

776
00:52:18,649 --> 00:52:19,775
Man, the shit don't ever stop.

777
00:52:19,983 --> 00:52:22,110
Yeah, D, what he's saying is that
we ain't got a hook.

778
00:52:22,319 --> 00:52:24,378
Well, shit, give it some hook, then!

779
00:52:24,588 --> 00:52:26,283
I mean, fuck, you the producer, man.

780
00:52:26,490 --> 00:52:29,084
You just tell me what
you want me to do, then.

781
00:52:29,293 --> 00:52:32,956
We need to lay down something,
Djay. Anything. Even if it's shit.

782
00:52:33,163 --> 00:52:37,862
And I keep telling you, I ain't putting
no shit on top of no shit, man.

783
00:52:38,068 --> 00:52:40,036
I ain't trying to sell no cash shit here.

784
00:52:40,237 --> 00:52:45,004
Well, that's the wonder of audiotape,
Djay. We can just record over shit.

785
00:52:46,176 --> 00:52:48,337
Go on, bring it back up, Shel.

786
00:52:48,846 --> 00:52:51,576
- Go on, bring it up!
- You need some ass, nigga?

787
00:52:51,782 --> 00:52:53,477
- What?
- Because I got a room full of pussy

788
00:52:53,684 --> 00:52:55,549
right in there for you.

789
00:52:57,621 --> 00:52:58,849
- Fuck you, Djay.
- Oh, fuck me?

790
00:52:59,056 --> 00:53:01,320
- Yeah, fuck you.
- No, no, fuck Yevette, man.

791
00:53:01,525 --> 00:53:04,323
Because she the one got your ass
wound up like a motherfucking clock.

792
00:53:04,528 --> 00:53:05,756
Look here, you dirt-rascal pimp,

793
00:53:05,963 --> 00:53:07,863
you keep my wife's name out
your mouth, you hear me?

794
00:53:08,065 --> 00:53:10,829
- Hey, guys, come on, keep it light.
- Sound like your wife,

795
00:53:11,034 --> 00:53:13,400
she the one need to put something
in her motherfucking mouth.

796
00:53:13,604 --> 00:53:15,367
- You know what I'm saying?
- Fuck you say, man?

797
00:53:15,572 --> 00:53:17,733
- You heard me, nigga!
- What the fuck you say, man?

798
00:53:17,941 --> 00:53:19,875
- That's what!
- Stop it, man! Sit down!

799
00:53:20,077 --> 00:53:21,601
- What?! What?!
- What's up, man?!

800
00:53:21,812 --> 00:53:23,939
Can you please stop it?
Do we have to do this?

801
00:53:24,147 --> 00:53:27,708
Can't we just smoke a joint,
for chrissake?!

802
00:53:27,918 --> 00:53:31,081
- Who is it?
- It's me, Shug.

803
00:53:31,288 --> 00:53:35,588
- Look, bitch, we working right now!
- I got something for you.

804
00:53:42,599 --> 00:53:44,760
Come on, man.

805
00:53:45,369 --> 00:53:47,599
Sorry to interrupt y'all's
recording session,

806
00:53:47,804 --> 00:53:50,637
but they had this interview
with Skinny Black on TV

807
00:53:50,841 --> 00:53:56,609
and look like he had one of these
in his studio where he uses,

808
00:53:56,813 --> 00:54:00,146
so I thought I'd go out
and buy you one.

809
00:54:00,651 --> 00:54:02,812
Y'all have fun.

810
00:54:21,972 --> 00:54:24,839
That's a bottom bitch for you.

811
00:54:25,742 --> 00:54:28,540
I mean, we got everything we need
right here.

812
00:54:28,745 --> 00:54:31,043
And all this stuff in this...

813
00:54:31,582 --> 00:54:35,541
This little-bitty space, man,
it just looks so much bigger now.

814
00:54:45,095 --> 00:54:47,689
I'm here trying to squeeze a dollar
out of a dime,

815
00:54:47,898 --> 00:54:50,628
and I ain't even got a cent, man.

816
00:54:52,102 --> 00:54:54,434
It takes time, Djay.

817
00:55:05,649 --> 00:55:07,981
Do y'all believe in omens?

818
00:55:12,222 --> 00:55:15,419
Okay, Shug, put your headphones on.

819
00:55:15,859 --> 00:55:17,986
- Move closer to the mike.
- Okay.

820
00:55:18,195 --> 00:55:19,560
Can you hear yourself?

821
00:55:20,464 --> 00:55:23,922
- Say something.
- Hello. Oh, yeah.

822
00:55:24,768 --> 00:55:26,030
Okay, Shug,

823
00:55:26,236 --> 00:55:28,670
what we need right now
is called a "hook."

824
00:55:28,872 --> 00:55:30,863
That's like the chorus of the song.

825
00:55:31,074 --> 00:55:34,908
Now, you're gonna be singing
what's on Djay's pad. Djay.

826
00:55:40,884 --> 00:55:42,283
All right, now.

827
00:55:42,486 --> 00:55:44,716
"You know it's hard out here
for a pimp

828
00:55:44,921 --> 00:55:47,082
when trying to get the money
for the rent.

829
00:55:47,290 --> 00:55:49,724
With the Cadillacs
and gas money spent,

830
00:55:49,926 --> 00:55:51,951
got a whole lot of bitches
jumping ship."

831
00:55:52,162 --> 00:55:54,562
"Jumping ship." Okay.

832
00:55:55,132 --> 00:55:58,932
Now, Shug, I got an idea
how this should go.

833
00:55:59,136 --> 00:56:00,899
Now, I suck,

834
00:56:01,104 --> 00:56:03,595
but, I'm gonna sing it with you
until you get it down, all right?

835
00:56:03,807 --> 00:56:05,138
Okay.

836
00:56:05,342 --> 00:56:08,675
You know it's hard out here

837
00:56:08,879 --> 00:56:11,313

And gas money spent

839
00:56:15,385 --> 00:56:18,718
Will cause a whole lot of bitches
Jumpin' ship

840
00:56:18,922 --> 00:56:22,483
- Okay, sing with me.
- Can I have that? Okay.

841
00:56:22,693 --> 00:56:25,389
You know it's hard out here
For a pimp

842
00:56:26,263 --> 00:56:29,596

846
00:56:37,474 --> 00:56:38,839
- Bitches jumpin' ship
- Jumping ship.

847
00:56:39,042 --> 00:56:41,101
- That's right. Okay?
- Okay.

848
00:56:41,311 --> 00:56:42,676
No, hold on, hold on.

849
00:56:42,879 --> 00:56:45,848
Nola, kill them fans.

850
00:56:46,750 --> 00:56:48,809
Okay, here we go.

851
00:56:49,352 --> 00:56:50,910
Okay.

852
00:56:54,491 --> 00:56:56,823
You know it's hard out here
For a pimp

853
00:56:57,027 --> 00:56:59,495
Shug, I'm gonna need you
to sing out, okay, baby?

854
00:56:59,696 --> 00:57:01,425
- Okay.
- Shug.

855
00:57:02,032 --> 00:57:03,260
Feel that.

856
00:57:07,003 --> 00:57:10,495
You know it's hard out here

859
00:57:17,214 --> 00:57:18,704
Can I say "for"?

860
00:57:21,051 --> 00:57:24,214
For the Cadillacs

That's the money take.

877
00:58:25,415 --> 00:58:28,213
- You got that?
- Hold on, we gonna see in a minute.

878
00:58:29,486 --> 00:58:31,852
Hey, D, I wanna do one.
I wanna put one down.

879
00:58:32,789 --> 00:58:34,086
No. Hush up, Nola.

880
00:58:34,558 --> 00:58:38,426
- You got that, or don't you?
- Hold on, hold on, hold on.

881
00:58:38,628 --> 00:58:41,563
We got something. We need to work.
Y'all need to leave the studio right now.

882
00:58:41,765 --> 00:58:44,199
- Did I fuck up?
- You didn't fuck up. Just go.

883
00:58:44,401 --> 00:58:46,096
Hey, Shelby, close the door.
We need to work.

884
00:58:46,303 --> 00:58:49,761
This is my motherfucking house, man.

885
00:58:50,473 --> 00:58:52,805
Ain't that some shit?

886
00:59:13,897 --> 00:59:15,888
Come on, fuck all that, man.

887
00:59:16,099 --> 00:59:17,623
You're on, dog.

888
00:59:23,573 --> 00:59:26,633
All right, D.
We about to lay you down now, man.

889
00:59:26,843 --> 00:59:28,743
That means we got
a fixed length, right?

890
00:59:28,945 --> 00:59:31,641
So that means don't say no more
than what you got on that pad.

891
00:59:31,848 --> 00:59:35,841
- I got you, man.
- Nola, kill the fan.

892
00:59:43,627 --> 00:59:45,424
Hold on, hold on.

893
00:59:46,863 --> 00:59:49,889
Shelby, you hear that?

894
00:59:51,234 --> 00:59:52,496
Yeah. What is that?

895
00:59:55,739 --> 00:59:58,071
- One of y'all leave the TV on?
- No.

896
01:00:02,646 --> 01:00:04,443
Goddamn.

897
01:00:06,116 --> 01:00:09,415
This day is really starting to fuck
with my mode, man.

898
01:00:10,220 --> 01:00:13,417
Hey, man, R.L. Over here?

899
01:00:25,869 --> 01:00:28,633
R.L., look, man, I'm sorry
to disturb you and all.

900
01:00:29,205 --> 01:00:31,230
And I know you and me,

901
01:00:31,441 --> 01:00:34,774
we done had words in the past and
some of them weren't too friendly.

902
01:00:34,978 --> 01:00:37,344
But right now, man, I got some shit
taking place in my crib

903
01:00:37,547 --> 01:00:41,210
that just requires a little bit of
silence. You know what I mean?

904
01:00:41,418 --> 01:00:46,082
Now, I'd never demand of you,
I can only request...

905
01:00:48,992 --> 01:00:52,359
...with a gesture of neighborly
friendliness, you know what I mean,

906
01:00:52,562 --> 01:00:57,829
that you please, please consider
the mute button just for a spell, man.

907
01:01:01,905 --> 01:01:03,497
All right, man.

908
01:01:08,278 --> 01:01:10,644
- Stand by, everybody.
- Standing by.

909
01:01:12,582 --> 01:01:14,311
I'm standing by.

910
01:01:28,264 --> 01:01:31,165
You know it's hard out here
For a pimp

911
01:01:31,368 --> 01:01:34,098
When he tryin' to get this money
For the rent

912
01:01:34,304 --> 01:01:37,102
For the Cadillacs
And gas money spent

913
01:01:37,307 --> 01:01:39,969
Will cause a whole lot of bitches
Jumpin' ship

914
01:01:40,176 --> 01:01:42,974
You know it's hard out here
For a pimp

915
01:01:43,179 --> 01:01:46,046
When he tryin' to get this money
For the rent

916
01:01:46,249 --> 01:01:48,877
For the Cadillacs
And gas money spent

917
01:01:49,085 --> 01:01:51,383
Will have a whole lot of bitches
Jumpin' ship

918
01:01:52,288 --> 01:01:55,086
With my eyes, I done seen
Some crazy things in the street

919
01:01:55,291 --> 01:01:58,021
Got a couple ho's working
On the changes for me

920
01:01:58,228 --> 01:02:01,095
But I gotta keep my game tight
Like Kobe on game night

921
01:02:01,297 --> 01:02:04,164
Like taking from a ho don't know
No better, I know that ain't right

922
01:02:04,367 --> 01:02:07,063
Done seen people killed
Done seen people deal

923
01:02:07,270 --> 01:02:10,000
Done seen people live in poverty
With no meals

924
01:02:10,206 --> 01:02:13,039
It's fucked up where I live
But this is how it is

925
01:02:13,243 --> 01:02:16,144
It might be new to you
But it's been like this for years

926
01:02:16,346 --> 01:02:19,008
It's blood, sweat and tears
When it come down to this shit

927
01:02:19,215 --> 01:02:22,116
I'm trying to get rich 'fore
I leave up out this bitch

928
01:02:22,318 --> 01:02:24,912
I'm trying to have things
But it's hard for a pimp

929
01:02:25,121 --> 01:02:27,851
But I'm prayin' and I'm hopin'
To God I don't slip, yeah

930
01:02:28,058 --> 01:02:30,117
You know it's hard out here
For a pimp

931
01:02:30,326 --> 01:02:31,418
You ain't know, nigga

932
01:02:31,628 --> 01:02:33,152
When he tryin' to get this money
For the rent

933
01:02:33,363 --> 01:02:34,421
You ain't know, nigga

934
01:02:34,631 --> 01:02:36,064
For the Cadillacs
And gas money spent

935
01:02:36,266 --> 01:02:37,358
You ain't know, nigga

936
01:02:37,567 --> 01:02:39,262
Will cause a whole lot of bitches
Jumpin' ship

937
01:02:39,469 --> 01:02:40,731
You ain't know, nigga

938
01:02:40,937 --> 01:02:42,131
You know it's hard out here
For a pimp

939
01:02:42,338 --> 01:02:43,362
You ain't know, nigga

940
01:02:43,573 --> 01:02:45,234
When he tryin' to get this money
For the rent

941
01:02:45,442 --> 01:02:46,500
You ain't know, nigga

942
01:02:46,709 --> 01:02:48,040
For the Cadillacs
And gas money spent

943
01:02:48,244 --> 01:02:49,370
You ain't know, nigga

944
01:02:49,579 --> 01:02:50,944
Will have a whole lot of bitches
Jumpin' ship

945
01:02:51,147 --> 01:02:52,205
You ain't know, nigga

946
01:02:52,415 --> 01:02:54,713
Man, it seems like I'm duckin'
Dodgin' bullets every day

947
01:02:54,918 --> 01:02:57,716
Niggas hatin' on me
'Cause I got ho's on the tray

948
01:02:57,921 --> 01:03:00,822
But I gotta stay paid
Gotta stay above water

949
01:03:01,024 --> 01:03:03,788
Couldn't keep up with my ho's
That's when shit got harder

950
01:03:03,993 --> 01:03:06,723
North Memphis, where I'm from
I'm Seventh Street bound

951
01:03:06,930 --> 01:03:09,728
Where niggas all the time
End up lost and never found

952
01:03:09,933 --> 01:03:11,491
Man, these girls take me
Through things

953
01:03:11,701 --> 01:03:13,100
Leave a big headache

954
01:03:13,303 --> 01:03:16,101
I'm hoping every night
They don't end up being dead weight

955
01:03:16,306 --> 01:03:18,831
I got a snow bunny
And a black girl too

956
01:03:19,042 --> 01:03:21,738
You pay the right price
And they'll both do you

957
01:03:21,945 --> 01:03:24,743
That's the way the game goes
Gotta keep it strictly pimpin'

958
01:03:24,948 --> 01:03:27,974
Gotta have my hustle tight
Makin' change off these women, yeah

959
01:03:28,184 --> 01:03:29,981
You know it's hard out here
For a pimp

960
01:03:30,186 --> 01:03:31,175
You ain't know, nigga

961
01:03:31,387 --> 01:03:32,945
When he tryin' to get this money
For the rent

962
01:03:33,156 --> 01:03:34,123
You ain't know, nigga

963
01:03:34,324 --> 01:03:35,916
For the Cadillacs
And gas money spent

964
01:03:36,126 --> 01:03:37,150
You ain't know, nigga

965
01:03:37,360 --> 01:03:38,793
Will cause a whole lot of bitches
Jumpin' ship

966
01:03:38,995 --> 01:03:40,053
You ain't know, nigga

967
01:03:40,263 --> 01:03:41,753
You know it's hard out here
For a pimp

968
01:03:41,965 --> 01:03:42,989
You ain't know, nigga

969
01:03:43,199 --> 01:03:44,666
When he tryin' to get this money
For the rent

970
01:03:44,868 --> 01:03:46,096
You ain't know, nigga

971
01:03:46,302 --> 01:03:47,633
For the Cadillacs
And gas money spent

972
01:03:47,837 --> 01:03:48,963
You ain't know, nigga

973
01:03:49,172 --> 01:03:51,333
Will have a whole lot of bitches
Jumpin' ship

974
01:03:51,541 --> 01:03:54,032
- Cut it. Cut it.
- What?

975
01:03:54,244 --> 01:03:56,644
Wait, man.
I got another verse, man!

976
01:03:59,983 --> 01:04:02,042
Djay, we need to talk, man.

977
01:04:02,819 --> 01:04:04,912
Look, I just want it to be perfect.
And this mike,

978
01:04:05,622 --> 01:04:07,522
it ain't shit.

979
01:04:07,724 --> 01:04:10,056
What the fuck wrong with it?
That shit record, don't it?

980
01:04:10,260 --> 01:04:15,857
Djay, the mikes we using, they got
a wider pattern, D. They go flat.

981
01:04:16,065 --> 01:04:19,330
So when you start screaming,
man, they just distort and pop out.

982
01:04:19,536 --> 01:04:21,868
Man, nigga, I don't know shit
about none of that shit!

983
01:04:22,071 --> 01:04:24,062
All I know is that shit
in there was live, man!

984
01:04:24,274 --> 01:04:26,105
And every time I get
my motherfucking mode up,

985
01:04:26,309 --> 01:04:27,901
- you come and fuck with it!
- It ain't me.

986
01:04:28,111 --> 01:04:30,045
That shit, it ain't gonna
be live like that again.

987
01:04:30,246 --> 01:04:31,679
I don't give a fuck what mike I'm on!

988
01:04:31,881 --> 01:04:35,908
Djay, that shit was live in there,

989
01:04:36,152 --> 01:04:38,780
but it was also distorted, man.

990
01:04:39,956 --> 01:04:41,480
God!

991
01:04:42,692 --> 01:04:45,126
I just don't understand why
I gotta pay so much more money

992
01:04:45,328 --> 01:04:46,886
for that microphone right there

993
01:04:47,096 --> 01:04:52,363
when the one right next to it
look just like it but cost half, man.

994
01:04:52,569 --> 01:04:53,797
Let's do it this way, man.

995
01:04:54,003 --> 01:04:57,564
If I buy two of them, say you give
them to me both for $90.

996
01:04:57,774 --> 01:05:01,540
This is studio quality. It costs $250.

997
01:05:01,744 --> 01:05:04,235
Now, why would I sell you
two of them for $90 apiece?

998
01:05:04,447 --> 01:05:05,880
Just because of that statement, man,

999
01:05:06,082 --> 01:05:08,107
"The customer's always right,"
ain't you heard?

1000
01:05:08,318 --> 01:05:10,513
Not in this case, sir, no.

1001
01:05:10,720 --> 01:05:13,450
If you want quality,
you have to pay for it.

1002
01:05:13,656 --> 01:05:18,025
Look, man, can't you cut me some
type of break on this stuff here?

1003
01:05:22,932 --> 01:05:24,058
What was that?

1004
01:05:25,401 --> 01:05:29,633
- What?
- I mean, what you looking at, man?

1005
01:05:30,206 --> 01:05:32,697
- Nothing.
- Don't worry, Sparky, man.

1006
01:05:32,909 --> 01:05:35,537
I ain't gonna pop or nothing like that.

1007
01:05:37,880 --> 01:05:39,905
Look here, man.

1008
01:05:40,116 --> 01:05:43,916
The thing is, that gal over there, right?

1009
01:05:44,120 --> 01:05:46,452
I got it in real good with her.

1010
01:05:46,656 --> 01:05:48,817
I mean, she's my gal and all,

1011
01:05:49,025 --> 01:05:53,121
but she don't necessarily
belong to me.

1012
01:05:54,964 --> 01:05:56,329
You see, a gal like that, man,

1013
01:05:56,532 --> 01:06:01,060
she the type of girl that wanna
shut them doors, lock them,

1014
01:06:01,271 --> 01:06:04,968
see what type of specials
you got going on in the back.

1015
01:06:05,808 --> 01:06:09,175
And me, I'm the kind of man that

1016
01:06:09,379 --> 01:06:11,711
just walk out of here and
leave a girl like that behind

1017
01:06:11,914 --> 01:06:17,147
because, like I say, she with me
and all, but she don't belong to me.

1018
01:06:17,353 --> 01:06:19,321
Not necessarily.

1019
01:06:19,822 --> 01:06:22,347
And maybe when she leaves...

1020
01:06:22,959 --> 01:06:26,861
...she can take something that don't
necessarily belong to her neither.

1021
01:06:27,430 --> 01:06:31,799
It's like you say, man, you want
quality, you got to pay for that.

1022
01:06:41,377 --> 01:06:43,038
Hey, gal.

1023
01:06:44,881 --> 01:06:47,111
I need that microphone.

1024
01:06:47,817 --> 01:06:48,784
Okay.

1025
01:06:48,985 --> 01:06:51,146
I need you to go back there
and be friendly with him

1026
01:06:51,354 --> 01:06:54,016
and bring that microphone
out with you, okay?

1027
01:06:54,957 --> 01:06:57,187
No. No way.

1028
01:06:57,393 --> 01:07:00,760
Nola, I need that microphone.

1029
01:07:00,963 --> 01:07:02,624
Get it.

1030
01:07:02,832 --> 01:07:05,027
Y'all be good, now.

1031
01:07:29,959 --> 01:07:31,449
Hey.

1032
01:07:40,937 --> 01:07:41,904
Hey.

1033
01:07:42,105 --> 01:07:45,006
- Don't ever do that to me again, D.
- What? I ain't...

1034
01:07:45,208 --> 01:07:48,473
No, I ain't some fucking cash machine,
where you can get shit for free.

1035
01:07:48,678 --> 01:07:50,305
Ain't like you was
in there sweating bullets.

1036
01:07:50,513 --> 01:07:53,038
- I gotta have a say in what I do!
- You was in there for a minute.

1037
01:07:53,249 --> 01:07:56,241
- I gotta have a say in what I do!
- Look, man, I was gonna give...

1038
01:07:56,452 --> 01:07:58,420
I'm not gonna suck dick
every time you come up short!

1039
01:07:58,621 --> 01:07:59,645
You got something for me.

1040
01:07:59,856 --> 01:08:01,983
- Do you got something for me?!
- Fuck you, D.

1041
01:08:02,191 --> 01:08:05,285
- Here, take it! You earned it!
- What the fuck's wrong with you?

1042
01:08:05,495 --> 01:08:08,521
This is expensive motherfucking...
Hey, Nola, bring your ass...

1043
01:08:08,731 --> 01:08:12,895
- I'm fucking out of here. I don't care.
- Nola! Don't you do this shit right now!

1044
01:08:13,536 --> 01:08:16,232
Nola! Bring your ass here, man!

1045
01:08:16,606 --> 01:08:18,904
Don't you ever walk away from me!

1046
01:08:19,509 --> 01:08:22,637
We do what the fuck
we gotta do, man! By any means!

1047
01:08:22,845 --> 01:08:26,406
Ain't that right?
We take care of our shit.

1048
01:08:26,616 --> 01:08:28,106
You think I like this shit?

1049
01:08:28,317 --> 01:08:30,046
You think I wanna
spend the rest of my life

1050
01:08:30,253 --> 01:08:32,244
pimping your pimpled country ass?

1051
01:08:32,455 --> 01:08:35,686
Well, not me! I fucking hate you.

1052
01:08:35,992 --> 01:08:38,051
I hate this shit!

1053
01:08:38,661 --> 01:08:40,026
D!

1054
01:08:43,065 --> 01:08:46,501
Do you know what I do
in the back of them cars?

1055
01:08:47,570 --> 01:08:49,470
Do you?

1056
01:08:49,672 --> 01:08:51,264
Everybody's got something to do!

1057
01:08:51,474 --> 01:08:56,639
Everybody's got something important
going on in their life but me, D!

1058
01:08:56,846 --> 01:08:58,780
And I want something!

1059
01:08:58,981 --> 01:09:01,609
- What do you want?
- I don't really know, but I want some...

1060
01:09:01,818 --> 01:09:03,877
- What do you want?
- I don't know.

1061
01:09:04,086 --> 01:09:08,147
- Tell me what the fuck you wanna do!
- Not this, D!

1062
01:09:18,501 --> 01:09:22,369
You know what, man?
I just got you dressed all wrong.

1063
01:09:22,572 --> 01:09:25,166
You know, bitch like you, man,
you need to have on

1064
01:09:25,374 --> 01:09:26,568
one of them suits.

1065
01:09:26,776 --> 01:09:29,301
Get you a mobile phone and shit.
Get an ear jack.

1066
01:09:29,512 --> 01:09:30,672
Man, you gonna feel different.

1067
01:09:30,880 --> 01:09:33,075
I'm gonna put you in some
new shoes tomorrow, man.

1068
01:09:33,282 --> 01:09:34,340
And you gonna feel

1069
01:09:34,550 --> 01:09:37,348
- like you are in charge.
- D!

1070
01:09:40,122 --> 01:09:42,818
I know when you're messing
with my head.

1071
01:09:43,192 --> 01:09:44,989
Because I let you.

1072
01:09:46,128 --> 01:09:49,495
Because sometimes my head
needs to be messed with.

1073
01:09:51,734 --> 01:09:55,795
But right now, just don't.

1074
01:09:56,572 --> 01:09:58,096
Okay?

1075
01:10:04,213 --> 01:10:05,976
Okay.

1076
01:10:21,531 --> 01:10:23,021
Hey, Shelby,
I need some high-hat, man.

1077
01:10:23,232 --> 01:10:25,097
Give me some high-hat
up top, all right?

1078
01:10:25,301 --> 01:10:27,030
Okay, man. This takes a little time.

1079
01:10:30,206 --> 01:10:33,004
Look, it should come in right
after the kick. Right there.

1080
01:10:36,512 --> 01:10:37,501
Yeah, that's it.

1081
01:10:40,116 --> 01:10:43,176
- Try that bit.
- Keep hustlin'

1082
01:10:45,187 --> 01:10:48,350
- Keep flowin'
- How that sound?

1083
01:10:48,558 --> 01:10:50,423
Tell her to put some more dick in it!

1084
01:10:50,626 --> 01:10:53,459
- Most gracious and heavenly Father,
- Okay.

1085
01:10:53,663 --> 01:10:56,826
We ask that you bless this food...

1086
01:10:59,135 --> 01:11:01,228
...and our home.

1087
01:11:18,020 --> 01:11:19,885
- Hi.
- Hey.

1088
01:11:20,089 --> 01:11:21,522
My name is Yevette.

1089
01:11:21,724 --> 01:11:25,319
I'm Clyde's... I mean, Key's wife.

1090
01:11:25,528 --> 01:11:27,519
Oh, yeah. He in the back
with the rest of the fellas.

1091
01:11:27,730 --> 01:11:29,698
They fitting to cut something.

1092
01:11:30,099 --> 01:11:31,066
Cut?

1093
01:11:31,267 --> 01:11:34,464
Well, I like that first one, but you don't.

1094
01:11:34,670 --> 01:11:37,901
Well, I think you should
throw out your best ball.

1095
01:11:38,107 --> 01:11:41,099
And to me, that's the second one.

1096
01:11:41,310 --> 01:11:44,336
Okay. We gonna gab, or we gonna
do the damn thing? Which one?

1097
01:11:44,547 --> 01:11:48,506
- Hey, let's beat that bitch, then, man.
- Hey, everybody.

1098
01:11:50,920 --> 01:11:53,445
This here's Yevette, Key's wife.

1099
01:11:54,423 --> 01:11:57,358
And look, she brought
everybody sandwiches.

1100
01:11:59,662 --> 01:12:01,960
Yeah, yeah. There's...

1101
01:12:02,164 --> 01:12:05,258
There's some dill sauce there
in the middle if y'all wanna dip.

1102
01:12:05,468 --> 01:12:06,867
If you want.

1103
01:12:08,437 --> 01:12:10,769
Hey, you know...

1104
01:12:12,541 --> 01:12:14,566
...Key worked really hard
on this last one there,

1105
01:12:14,777 --> 01:12:18,941
so you might wanna
just take a little listen to it.

1106
01:12:20,349 --> 01:12:23,182
Oh, no. I don't wanna interrupt. I...

1107
01:12:23,386 --> 01:12:28,915
- It's just dinnertime. I thought y'all...
- But I think we'd like for you to stay.

1108
01:12:29,125 --> 01:12:30,717
Right, Key?

1109
01:12:38,601 --> 01:12:40,159
Yeah.

1110
01:12:43,472 --> 01:12:44,905
Okay.

1111
01:12:47,810 --> 01:12:50,608
Look, this track here, man, this...

1112
01:12:50,813 --> 01:12:53,748
This is my heart, man, so...

1113
01:12:54,483 --> 01:12:55,973
Before I do my thing,

1114
01:12:56,185 --> 01:12:58,380
put my mouth to this mike,

1115
01:12:58,587 --> 01:13:03,047
I wanna bless it with a kiss
from my primary investor, all right?

1116
01:13:05,394 --> 01:13:07,089
Come on, baby.

1117
01:13:13,936 --> 01:13:15,665
Go on, girl.

1118
01:13:23,412 --> 01:13:27,473
Hey, just like our primary investor,
that mike is hot.

1119
01:13:28,284 --> 01:13:30,115
So kill them fans.

1120
01:13:56,378 --> 01:13:57,504
Look, this is my life

1121
01:13:57,713 --> 01:14:00,477
And it's a battle within
I gotta survive

1122
01:14:00,683 --> 01:14:02,116
Even if I'm sinnin' to win

1123
01:14:02,318 --> 01:14:05,185
And if I show no remorse
I'll reap the devil's reward

1124
01:14:05,387 --> 01:14:08,049
He said he'd give me riches
But I'm lookin' for more

1125
01:14:08,257 --> 01:14:11,249
When I was young
Witnessed my dad standin' for right

1126
01:14:11,460 --> 01:14:13,985
Black pride in him
Even though he passin' for white

1127
01:14:14,196 --> 01:14:16,858
Took years from my life
Now I'm missin' the man

1128
01:14:17,066 --> 01:14:19,933
Mom's on some other shit
And now I'm missin' the plan

1129
01:14:20,136 --> 01:14:22,934
So I'm stuck
In this fuck-the-world mold

1130
01:14:23,139 --> 01:14:25,733
All the lessons
To a young teen nigga was cold

1131
01:14:25,941 --> 01:14:28,671
Then my pimpin' ass uncle
Put me up on the game

1132
01:14:28,878 --> 01:14:31,608
It really ain't no love
It's 'bout this paper, man

1133
01:14:31,814 --> 01:14:34,510
Put me in a position
Got me out on a mission

1134
01:14:34,717 --> 01:14:37,413
Collectin' from the ho's
Turned me on about pimpin'

1135
01:14:37,620 --> 01:14:40,214
A nigga from Memphis
Dealin' with life as a struggle

1136
01:14:40,422 --> 01:14:43,255
This is the gift I was given
So I just live by my hustle

1137
01:14:43,692 --> 01:14:45,819
Keep hustlin'

1138
01:14:46,328 --> 01:14:48,922
It ain't over for me
No, it ain't over for me

1139
01:14:49,298 --> 01:14:52,290
Keep flowin'
Flowin'

1140
01:14:52,568 --> 01:14:54,832
I'ma step my game up
And get what's coming to me

1141
01:14:55,037 --> 01:14:57,597
Keep hustlin'

1142
01:14:58,207 --> 01:15:00,767
It ain't over for me
No, it ain't over for me

1143
01:15:00,976 --> 01:15:03,672
Keep flowin'
Keep on flowin'

1144
01:15:03,879 --> 01:15:06,814
I'ma step my game up
And get what's coming to me

1145
01:15:07,016 --> 01:15:09,143
We got to get this shit done
by the Fourth of July, man,

1146
01:15:09,351 --> 01:15:12,184
because I got some people
I gotta slip this to.

1147
01:15:12,421 --> 01:15:15,151
- Who do you know?
- You remember Skinny Black.

1148
01:15:15,357 --> 01:15:18,554
I think I see a hater right there.
Hold up.

1149
01:15:19,662 --> 01:15:21,721
Hey, there go Skinny Black, man!

1150
01:15:21,931 --> 01:15:24,399
- "Skinny Black" Skinny Black?
- Yeah, I know who Skinny Black is.

1151
01:15:24,600 --> 01:15:27,125
I've got all of his early stuff,
back when he was still good.

1152
01:15:27,336 --> 01:15:29,236
Now, do you really know him,
or just know of him?

1153
01:15:29,438 --> 01:15:32,532
I mean, he may not know me, because
we went to different schools and all.

1154
01:15:32,741 --> 01:15:36,040
We went to different schools and all,
but, yeah, I know Skinny.

1155
01:15:36,245 --> 01:15:38,179
But I'm here to let you know
you ain't taking shit,

1156
01:15:38,380 --> 01:15:39,847
because I'm running
this goddamn thing!

1157
01:15:40,049 --> 01:15:43,212
You wanna make a dollar? Best get
your ass up here with that good shit.

1158
01:15:43,419 --> 01:15:44,579
Those boys don't want
dirt weed.

1159
01:15:44,787 --> 01:15:48,052
Me and him gonna be kicking it over
at Arnel's club on the Fourth of July.

1160
01:15:48,257 --> 01:15:52,193
If I can pimp $20 ho's out the back
of this fucked-up Chevy,

1161
01:15:52,661 --> 01:15:53,685
I can pimp Skinny.

1162
01:15:53,896 --> 01:15:56,160
Now I'm just gettin' by
And it's fuckin' with me

1163
01:15:56,365 --> 01:15:59,232
See others doin' big things
They was nothin' to me

1164
01:15:59,435 --> 01:16:02,336
I'm seeing what I used to be
And it's lookin' legit

1165
01:16:02,538 --> 01:16:05,234
Got my hands on some music
Started fuckin' with it

1166
01:16:05,441 --> 01:16:08,137
Put it down hard
Then I started pumpin' to this

1167
01:16:08,344 --> 01:16:11,211
I let some others get a dose
And they was nuttin' to this

1168
01:16:11,413 --> 01:16:14,041
Let me check my connections
'Cause we go back in the day

1169
01:16:14,250 --> 01:16:17,014
Say they was lookin' for 'dro
Heard I was hustlin' hay

1170
01:16:17,219 --> 01:16:20,017
Got me connin' my niggas
Spittin' game to my ho's

1171
01:16:20,222 --> 01:16:22,952
This my opportunity
I feel like anything goes

1172
01:16:23,158 --> 01:16:25,786
I was never supposed to see
The new millennium, man

1173
01:16:25,995 --> 01:16:28,657
And I refuse
To let my dad die in vain

1174
01:16:28,864 --> 01:16:31,560
So I give it my all
You feel my struggle and pain

1175
01:16:31,767 --> 01:16:34,634
If you ain't feelin' what I'm spittin'
Trick, you lame to the game

1176
01:16:34,837 --> 01:16:37,499
But the closest ones to me
Know I'm holdin' it down

1177
01:16:37,706 --> 01:16:40,470
You gonna feel me one day
We gonna be hurtin' the town

1178
01:16:40,676 --> 01:16:42,701
Keep hustlin'

1179
01:16:43,545 --> 01:16:46,241
It ain't over for me
No, it ain't over for me

1180
01:16:46,448 --> 01:16:48,916

1182
01:16:52,254 --> 01:16:55,018
Keep hustlin'
Keep on hustlin'

1183
01:16:55,224 --> 01:16:57,954
It ain't over for me
No, it ain't over for me

1184
01:16:58,160 --> 01:17:00,720
Keep flowin'
Keep on flowin'

1185
01:17:01,263 --> 01:17:04,755
I'ma step my game up
And get what's coming to me

1186
01:17:52,915 --> 01:17:54,576
Thank you.

1187
01:18:01,790 --> 01:18:04,281
Ain't you gonna be hot in your coat?

1188
01:18:04,493 --> 01:18:06,461
No, this is good leather, man.

1189
01:18:06,662 --> 01:18:08,789
The kind that keep you
at the temperature you wanna be at,

1190
01:18:08,998 --> 01:18:10,488
know what I mean?

1191
01:18:13,002 --> 01:18:15,334
See this thing right here?

1192
01:18:19,074 --> 01:18:21,542
This was my daddy's watch.

1193
01:18:23,145 --> 01:18:26,239
He used to work
for the school district and all...

1194
01:18:26,715 --> 01:18:29,707
...fixing them buses all over town.

1195
01:18:33,555 --> 01:18:34,886
Yeah.

1196
01:18:35,090 --> 01:18:38,025
Every now and then, when I see
them buses go by today,

1197
01:18:38,227 --> 01:18:39,854
I get all excited
because I say,

1198
01:18:40,062 --> 01:18:43,156
"My daddy used to work
on that," you know?

1199
01:18:43,432 --> 01:18:47,266
But, you know, after he'd been
there maybe about ten years or so,

1200
01:18:47,469 --> 01:18:49,562
gave him this and...

1201
01:18:50,205 --> 01:18:52,605
Kind of thought about burying
him with it, but then again I said,

1202
01:18:52,808 --> 01:18:56,369
"Maybe not, maybe I should keep it
as an heirloom," know what I mean?

1203
01:19:10,526 --> 01:19:13,620
- I got you something.
- What?

1204
01:19:15,264 --> 01:19:18,700
Well, it's like, you know, I been
watching them videos and all.

1205
01:19:18,901 --> 01:19:23,634
And it be like all them rappers,
they got some chain.

1206
01:19:24,306 --> 01:19:25,773
So...

1207
01:19:31,947 --> 01:19:33,141
Oh, shit.

1208
01:19:34,483 --> 01:19:35,745
Yeah.

1209
01:19:35,951 --> 01:19:38,613
You always talking about your name
being right and everything,

1210
01:19:38,821 --> 01:19:43,053
so I thought people
could see how you like it spelled out.

1211
01:19:43,258 --> 01:19:45,522
You know, with the J-A-Y.

1212
01:19:48,363 --> 01:19:49,830
Damn.

1213
01:19:51,800 --> 01:19:55,497
- This shit is perfect, man.
- Let me put it on.

1214
01:19:59,608 --> 01:20:02,304
- I wanna see it.
- Okay.

1215
01:20:07,015 --> 01:20:09,006
- D.
- What?

1216
01:20:11,653 --> 01:20:13,985
I can't believe...
I get like this

1217
01:20:14,189 --> 01:20:17,158
because I'm pregnant and everything...

1218
01:20:17,359 --> 01:20:19,725
...but, you know,
letting me sing on the...

1219
01:20:19,928 --> 01:20:23,091
On the demo and everything
like you do...

1220
01:20:23,765 --> 01:20:27,701
...well, it just...
It made me feel real...

1221
01:20:28,103 --> 01:20:30,162
Real special.

1222
01:20:30,806 --> 01:20:32,364
And...

1223
01:20:32,574 --> 01:20:36,169
I mean, I know y'all gonna
be moving on and moving up...

1224
01:20:37,179 --> 01:20:39,477
...and y'all are gonna get
real good people to sing,

1225
01:20:39,681 --> 01:20:42,878
you know, backup for you
and everything...

1226
01:20:44,186 --> 01:20:45,881
...but I just...

1227
01:20:46,955 --> 01:20:50,391
D, I need you to know
it meant the world to me.

1228
01:20:52,661 --> 01:20:54,060
Come here.

1229
01:20:58,967 --> 01:21:01,527
Thank you so much, D.

1230
01:21:11,146 --> 01:21:13,706
Djay, come on, man,
you gotta be there at 9:00, right?

1231
01:21:13,916 --> 01:21:17,647
Calm your ass down, man.
He gonna be there all night.

1232
01:21:22,024 --> 01:21:23,821
I ain't scared.

1233
01:21:27,396 --> 01:21:29,159
I know.

1234
01:21:44,580 --> 01:21:46,878
- Come on, man.
- Wow, check it out.

1235
01:21:47,482 --> 01:21:51,213
Okay, look here. Djay, I put some
extra demos in the car, all right, man?

1236
01:21:51,420 --> 01:21:52,853
In case they have
some label folk there.

1237
01:21:53,055 --> 01:21:56,115
Hey, if they want CDs, they just
gonna have to hit us back on that.

1238
01:21:56,325 --> 01:21:59,351
Man, I like that.
I need to get one of those.

1239
01:21:59,561 --> 01:22:01,028
D.

1240
01:22:02,164 --> 01:22:05,964
- You all right, man?
- You got your mode on, D?

1241
01:22:08,003 --> 01:22:10,062
Hold up for a second.

1242
01:23:38,060 --> 01:23:40,426
Came to party tonight.

1243
01:23:40,796 --> 01:23:43,924
What's happening with you, man?
Where your boy at?

1244
01:23:44,132 --> 01:23:46,191
Over at the big table.

1245
01:23:47,502 --> 01:23:51,802
- I don't see him, man.
- I'll take you over. You ready?

1246
01:23:53,041 --> 01:23:56,010
Hey, let's get a drink first, man.

1247
01:23:56,311 --> 01:23:58,404
All right, what the hell.

1248
01:23:58,613 --> 01:24:02,913
- Hey, I see you packing tonight, huh?
- Do a bear shit in the woods?

1249
01:24:03,452 --> 01:24:07,047
Hey, who the fuck is that?
Hey, who the fuck is that, man?

1250
01:24:07,255 --> 01:24:11,851
Oh, man, I can't believe what my
goddamn eyes are seeing right now!

1251
01:24:12,060 --> 01:24:13,550
I'm gonna have
to get a Seeing Eye nigga

1252
01:24:13,762 --> 01:24:16,526
just to tell me what the fuck
I'm looking at, man!

1253
01:24:16,732 --> 01:24:18,859
Is it? Could it be?

1254
01:24:19,067 --> 01:24:20,728
The one, the goddamn only...

1255
01:24:20,936 --> 01:24:22,597
Skinny!

1256
01:24:22,971 --> 01:24:24,302
- Is that you?
- Slobs!

1257
01:24:24,506 --> 01:24:26,667
- Boy, you fat, black and nasty,
- My nigga.

1258
01:24:26,875 --> 01:24:29,241
- Greasy ham-hock, chicken-eating,
- You Ethiopian poster boy.

1259
01:24:29,444 --> 01:24:31,708
- Can't-see-your-own-dick,
- Middle Eastern stepchild.

1260
01:24:31,913 --> 01:24:35,314
Ass-crack-longer-than-the-
M-l-S-S-l-S-S-l-P-P-I,

1261
01:24:35,517 --> 01:24:37,348
fat, black, nasty bastard!

1262
01:24:37,552 --> 01:24:40,112
- What's going on?
- Come here, nigga!

1263
01:24:40,322 --> 01:24:41,914
- How's my nigga?
- Back in the day, nigga.

1264
01:24:42,124 --> 01:24:43,614
- Yeah, that was it.
- Back in the day.

1265
01:24:43,825 --> 01:24:45,122
Back in the motherfucking day.

1266
01:24:45,327 --> 01:24:47,659
Bring your ass over here, man.
Let me get you a drink.

1267
01:24:47,863 --> 01:24:49,728
A drink in your hand
and some pussy in your lap.

1268
01:24:49,931 --> 01:24:51,796
Hey, I need that!

1269
01:24:54,503 --> 01:24:56,494
You ready to go over?

1270
01:24:57,305 --> 01:24:59,535
Hold... Hold up, man.

1271
01:25:04,479 --> 01:25:06,003
Hey, man.

1272
01:25:18,760 --> 01:25:21,251
Skinny, I think
you know my man Djay.

1273
01:25:22,597 --> 01:25:25,725
- Man, I don't know this nigga, man.
- Hey, baby, it's been a long time.

1274
01:25:25,934 --> 01:25:27,925
No, it's cool, man. It's nice
to see you home again.

1275
01:25:28,136 --> 01:25:30,195
Got all these folks telling me
I been gone too long.

1276
01:25:30,405 --> 01:25:34,466
Like I'm coming back or something.
Like there's a back to get back to.

1277
01:25:34,676 --> 01:25:37,440
I say, fuck!
Best place to keep Memphis

1278
01:25:37,646 --> 01:25:40,080
is in my rear-view,
you know what I'm saying?

1279
01:25:40,282 --> 01:25:42,113
You know what I'm saying,
whoever the fuck you is?

1280
01:25:42,317 --> 01:25:43,375
You know what I'm saying?

1281
01:25:43,585 --> 01:25:45,519
Hey, man, what's up
with your boy, man?

1282
01:25:45,720 --> 01:25:47,415
- Skinny.
- I don't need this shit.

1283
01:25:47,622 --> 01:25:50,284
This is the man
I was telling you about.

1284
01:25:53,428 --> 01:25:56,261
- Oh, this here the man?
- This here Djay.

1285
01:25:56,465 --> 01:25:59,628
- You and me, we went to different...
- Djay like short-for-something DJ,

1286
01:25:59,835 --> 01:26:02,827
or you mean like... that type of DJ?

1287
01:26:04,506 --> 01:26:08,704
- No, man. It's just... It's just Djay.
- Man, every time I come to Memphis,

1288
01:26:08,910 --> 01:26:12,175
my folks hooking me up with this
old dirt-ass weed out here, man.

1289
01:26:12,380 --> 01:26:14,575
Like they grow it out the ass
of some redneck or something.

1290
01:26:14,783 --> 01:26:17,650
But my boy Arnel here
say you slinging that killer.

1291
01:26:17,853 --> 01:26:19,286
Is that real, or what?

1292
01:26:21,356 --> 01:26:23,153
Baby, you be the judge for that.

1293
01:26:25,494 --> 01:26:26,893
How much I owe you for this, man?

1294
01:26:27,095 --> 01:26:29,120
Here now, seeing how friendly
you are to me

1295
01:26:29,331 --> 01:26:31,856
and the fact we go back in the day,

1296
01:26:32,067 --> 01:26:33,728
it's on me, okay?

1297
01:26:34,202 --> 01:26:36,397
Well, go on ahead and have a seat,
my blood brother.

1298
01:26:37,772 --> 01:26:41,799
Hell, yeah. Check this out here.
Smell that. Damn, boy.

1299
01:26:42,010 --> 01:26:44,774
Boy, he wasn't playing around
with this here! I think I'm in love.

1300
01:26:44,980 --> 01:26:46,470
You remember way back in the day

1301
01:26:46,681 --> 01:26:49,707
when you used to be hustling
your tapes over at the drive-in, man?

1302
01:26:49,918 --> 01:26:53,081
- What?
- Look at that ass, boy!

1303
01:26:53,288 --> 01:26:57,520
God bless America in this
motherfucker! What's going on, baby?

1304
01:26:57,726 --> 01:27:01,059
It's Independence Day!
It is Independence Day, right?

1305
01:27:01,263 --> 01:27:02,821
You know, I got that up from...

1306
01:27:03,031 --> 01:27:06,262
There's this little dude brought that
up from New Orleans, man.

1307
01:27:07,235 --> 01:27:08,896
Me first! Me first!

1308
01:27:53,315 --> 01:27:55,306
Hey, Skinny!

1309
01:27:58,053 --> 01:28:00,453
What the fuck
happened to you, man?

1310
01:28:03,191 --> 01:28:05,716
What the fuck
happened to you, man?

1311
01:28:05,927 --> 01:28:08,020
What the fuck did you just say?

1312
01:28:11,166 --> 01:28:13,999
I don't mean no disrespect and all.

1313
01:28:14,302 --> 01:28:18,238
I just remember when your first
underground crunk

1314
01:28:18,440 --> 01:28:20,567
hit the motherfucking streets, man,

1315
01:28:20,775 --> 01:28:23,835
that shit flew through Memphis
like a motherfucking typhoon.

1316
01:28:24,045 --> 01:28:25,444
Y'all was there, man.

1317
01:28:25,647 --> 01:28:28,878
Nigga couldn't even walk halfway
down the block without the pavement

1318
01:28:29,084 --> 01:28:31,917
crumbling underneath his feet
because some cat was bumping

1319
01:28:32,120 --> 01:28:35,055
your shit
out the back of his Caddy, man.

1320
01:28:35,523 --> 01:28:37,184
We just miss you, Skinny, that's all.

1321
01:28:37,392 --> 01:28:40,486
Miss me? Get up, bitch.
Hold up. Hold up. Hold up.

1322
01:28:40,695 --> 01:28:44,096
- Miss me? Nigga, I don't even...
- Fuck this nigga, man.

1323
01:28:44,299 --> 01:28:45,630
So wait, wait, wait, wait.

1324
01:28:45,834 --> 01:28:47,802
You trying to say
I can't cut it no more?

1325
01:28:48,003 --> 01:28:50,471
Like I ain't the shit?
That's what you trying to tell me?

1326
01:28:50,672 --> 01:28:53,869
- I ain't saying nothing like that.
- Then what the fuck is you saying?

1327
01:28:54,075 --> 01:28:55,872
What is you saying, then?

1328
01:29:01,082 --> 01:29:03,312
Dig this right here, man.

1329
01:29:04,219 --> 01:29:07,347
One day, this whole motherfucking
place is gonna be gone.

1330
01:29:07,555 --> 01:29:10,820
This club, this city, man.

1331
01:29:11,026 --> 01:29:13,722
This whole U.S. Of A., man,
is just gonna turn to dust, right?

1332
01:29:14,229 --> 01:29:17,198
And a whole new civilization
is gonna rise from this one.

1333
01:29:17,399 --> 01:29:18,866
And they gonna start digging,
you know.

1334
01:29:19,067 --> 01:29:21,126
They gonna dig up
the pyramids over in Egypt.

1335
01:29:21,336 --> 01:29:23,270
They gonna dig up the Eiffel Tower,

1336
01:29:23,471 --> 01:29:25,735
Statue of Liberty and the Empire State.

1337
01:29:25,940 --> 01:29:27,874
But if a nigga
wanna know about me?

1338
01:29:28,076 --> 01:29:29,805
Wanna know about Memphis?

1339
01:29:30,011 --> 01:29:34,573
All they gotta do is find your
first underground tape, nigga.

1340
01:29:34,783 --> 01:29:38,913
North Third Thugs. Motherfuck it,
man. That was the shit.

1341
01:29:39,120 --> 01:29:42,681
You know, I cut that shit in my
own mama's laundry room, man.

1342
01:29:42,891 --> 01:29:44,119
Boy, it was raw as hell,

1343
01:29:44,325 --> 01:29:46,919
but I put everything I had
into that shit, man.

1344
01:29:47,128 --> 01:29:50,859
Yeah, but see, to me that was a sign
of your genius, you know?

1345
01:29:51,066 --> 01:29:55,469
See, because it's not enough
for a man to climb Mount Everest.

1346
01:29:55,670 --> 01:29:58,036
You know, he gotta do that shit
with the least amount of tools.

1347
01:29:58,239 --> 01:30:01,231
- It's about the man. One man.
- One man and his skills.

1348
01:30:01,443 --> 01:30:04,173
Like the samurai say, "The sword is
only as powerful as its master."

1349
01:30:04,379 --> 01:30:07,815
And it ain't the size
of the dog in the fight, it's the size

1350
01:30:08,016 --> 01:30:10,246
- of the fight in the dog, nigga.
- Of the fight in the dog.

1351
01:30:10,452 --> 01:30:12,317
- My nigga.
- My nigga. Shit.

1352
01:30:12,520 --> 01:30:14,545
You know, and I know
a nigga like you, man,

1353
01:30:14,756 --> 01:30:16,621
a man gotta do
what a man gotta do, right?

1354
01:30:16,825 --> 01:30:19,055
You know, sometimes a nigga
gotta surround himself

1355
01:30:19,260 --> 01:30:20,693
with a whole bunch
of motherfuckers

1356
01:30:20,895 --> 01:30:24,296
that think they got a say
in who the fuck Skinny Black is.

1357
01:30:24,499 --> 01:30:26,592
Yeah, they pimping me.
I ain't gonna lie about that.

1358
01:30:26,801 --> 01:30:28,393
Gotta break bread with all these

1359
01:30:28,603 --> 01:30:31,071
number-crunching motherfuckers,
man. It ain't like it used to be.

1360
01:30:31,272 --> 01:30:33,763
Hey, baby, you ain't gotta explain
a damn thing to me, man.

1361
01:30:33,975 --> 01:30:35,533
Because I'm always
gonna be here for you.

1362
01:30:35,744 --> 01:30:39,475
Same way we was here for you
way back in the day.

1363
01:30:39,681 --> 01:30:41,672
- Oh, man.
- He got a cassette tape.

1364
01:30:41,883 --> 01:30:44,613
- Remember that?
- This nigga tripping, man.

1365
01:30:44,819 --> 01:30:46,480
Man, look at this shit!

1366
01:30:46,688 --> 01:30:50,146
Tigga, Slobs, you see what this nigga
got, man? My underground, man.

1367
01:30:50,358 --> 01:30:53,327
Where the fuck you get this from?
I ain't even got no more of these left!

1368
01:30:54,763 --> 01:30:57,960
Skinny, you got thousands of those
left in you.

1369
01:30:58,333 --> 01:31:03,134
All you gotta do is just come back
home, man. Because we miss you.

1370
01:31:05,640 --> 01:31:07,505
Come home, man.

1371
01:31:14,249 --> 01:31:16,274
You stand behind your product, nigga?

1372
01:31:21,689 --> 01:31:24,214
Is a pig's pussy pork?

1373
01:31:51,186 --> 01:31:53,746
I had this Mustang, right?

1374
01:31:54,355 --> 01:31:57,381
Motherfucking tight-ass ride!
You hear me?

1375
01:31:57,592 --> 01:31:58,991
Hood snout.

1376
01:31:59,194 --> 01:32:01,185
- What the fuck is a hood snout?
- Maple dash.

1377
01:32:01,396 --> 01:32:04,297
It's the goddamn hood come up,
like that from the sides,

1378
01:32:04,499 --> 01:32:05,761
- like a fucking nose.
- Okay.

1379
01:32:05,967 --> 01:32:08,435
- Hood snout, maple dash.
- Shit.

1380
01:32:08,636 --> 01:32:11,196
You know what I mean?
Two-tone metallic monster

1381
01:32:11,406 --> 01:32:14,136
- motherfucker, you know?
- I hear you.

1382
01:32:14,342 --> 01:32:16,640
So I go to my lady's crib
over there in The Courts, right?

1383
01:32:16,845 --> 01:32:18,904
- You had one in The Courts?
- I had one in The Courts.

1384
01:32:19,113 --> 01:32:22,344
- You had one in The Courts?
- I had a few of them in The Courts.

1385
01:32:22,550 --> 01:32:25,917
So, look, man, I go up in there, right?
I get my ugly on real quick,

1386
01:32:26,120 --> 01:32:28,953
come out, my ride is gone!
You hear me?

1387
01:32:29,157 --> 01:32:30,647
- Gone in 60 seconds?
- Gone in 60...

1388
01:32:30,859 --> 01:32:32,053
And I nut pretty damn fast,

1389
01:32:32,260 --> 01:32:35,991
so them niggas must've
took my ride like that! You hear me?

1390
01:32:36,197 --> 01:32:39,860
So I call up my crew. I call my crew
up, I'm like, "Come pick me up."

1391
01:32:40,068 --> 01:32:43,367
Because I know there's only one place
them niggas going riding in my car.

1392
01:32:43,571 --> 01:32:45,198
That's motherfucking
Millbranch, man.

1393
01:32:45,406 --> 01:32:48,933
Millbranch. Millbranch, right?

1394
01:32:49,410 --> 01:32:51,275
So we go down to Millbranch,
and we wait.

1395
01:32:51,479 --> 01:32:55,848
And sure enough, just like I said,
not even an hour go by,

1396
01:32:56,050 --> 01:32:58,177
and these niggas
coming in my ride, right?

1397
01:32:58,386 --> 01:33:00,980
So we roll up in front. We box them in.

1398
01:33:01,222 --> 01:33:02,655
Next thing you know,
20 motherfuckers

1399
01:33:02,857 --> 01:33:05,121
come rushing at these niggas,
pulling them out of my car.

1400
01:33:05,326 --> 01:33:06,987
I'm just screaming
like a little bitch, like,

1401
01:33:07,195 --> 01:33:09,288
"Don't touch my car!
Don't touch my car!"

1402
01:33:09,497 --> 01:33:12,728
Tripping, man. I can sit back
and laugh about it now,

1403
01:33:12,934 --> 01:33:15,994
but goddamn it, it wasn't funny then.
You hear me? At all.

1404
01:33:16,204 --> 01:33:19,765
You know, I'm sitting here
listening to you, man.

1405
01:33:19,974 --> 01:33:22,966
And you ain't bragging and shit,
man, you just telling me how it is

1406
01:33:23,177 --> 01:33:25,873
being on the side of the moon
that you see from.

1407
01:33:26,080 --> 01:33:28,014
And I realize a nigga like me ain't...

1408
01:33:28,216 --> 01:33:30,878
I ain't but a slice of cheese
off your motherfucking cracker, man.

1409
01:33:31,085 --> 01:33:33,519
- Right.
- You know...

1410
01:33:34,622 --> 01:33:37,090
...but I got this thing right here.

1411
01:33:37,292 --> 01:33:39,089
My motherfucking heart
beats in this thing, man.

1412
01:33:39,294 --> 01:33:40,989
Fuck I'm gonna do
with a cassette tape, man?

1413
01:33:41,195 --> 01:33:44,096
See, that's my blood pumped
in this shit, man.

1414
01:33:44,299 --> 01:33:45,994
Dog, do you know it's
a new millennium, nigga?

1415
01:33:46,200 --> 01:33:47,861
I can't do nothing
with no cassette tape.

1416
01:33:48,069 --> 01:33:49,730
I don't even have
a cassette-tape player.

1417
01:33:49,938 --> 01:33:52,304
- What the fuck is this shit here?
- I ain't trying to play you.

1418
01:33:52,507 --> 01:33:55,442
I appreciate the fact you talking
to me man-to-man like this and shit.

1419
01:33:55,643 --> 01:33:57,838
Hell, treating me like an equal, man.

1420
01:33:58,046 --> 01:34:01,641
And the only reason I give you
that right there is because...

1421
01:34:01,849 --> 01:34:04,079
...you know, you and me,
we come from the same place,

1422
01:34:04,285 --> 01:34:06,480
- you know what I mean?
- Right. That's the truth, man.

1423
01:34:06,688 --> 01:34:09,782
- Hell, we old friends, man.
- Definitely. Definitely old friends, man.

1424
01:34:09,991 --> 01:34:12,186
And I'm gonna tell you something.

1425
01:34:12,393 --> 01:34:13,485
I miss you, Jay.

1426
01:34:14,062 --> 01:34:17,259
- Man, it's Djay, man!
- Djay.

1427
01:34:17,465 --> 01:34:19,365
- Djay, man!
- Djay, my bad, nigga.

1428
01:34:19,567 --> 01:34:21,296
- My bad. Djay, Djay.
- Djay.

1429
01:34:21,502 --> 01:34:24,596
You know, in real life, man,

1430
01:34:24,872 --> 01:34:28,638
you know, if you give me a shot...

1431
01:34:29,377 --> 01:34:31,208
...you know, just...

1432
01:34:31,412 --> 01:34:34,643
Just give me a chance
to get my voice heard, man,

1433
01:34:34,849 --> 01:34:36,908
you know, I wouldn't...

1434
01:34:38,152 --> 01:34:40,313
I think I wouldn't even have words
for that shit, man.

1435
01:34:41,356 --> 01:34:43,984
Let me tell you something, man.
Look here.

1436
01:34:44,192 --> 01:34:46,285
- Got something I wanna tell you.
- Shit, he getting up.

1437
01:34:46,494 --> 01:34:48,325
- Don't get up.
- Listen to me, this is important.

1438
01:34:48,529 --> 01:34:50,360
Now, this is serious. Look at me.

1439
01:34:50,565 --> 01:34:52,396
Look at me, man.

1440
01:34:53,101 --> 01:34:54,966
- Okay, man.
- You laughing, this shit ain't funny.

1441
01:34:55,169 --> 01:34:57,399
- I'm serious, now.
- Okay, I'm with you.

1442
01:34:57,605 --> 01:35:00,574
Everybody gotta have a dream, boy.

1443
01:35:00,775 --> 01:35:04,040
Everybody got to have a dream.
You hear me?

1444
01:35:04,245 --> 01:35:06,475
I hear you, man.

1445
01:35:06,814 --> 01:35:09,282
- You know what I'm talking about?
- Don't make... Don't fall, man!

1446
01:35:09,484 --> 01:35:11,577
I can't help you, man.

1447
01:35:13,788 --> 01:35:15,449
Where the bathroom at?

1448
01:35:15,656 --> 01:35:18,056
Nigga, over there, man. Go get it.

1449
01:35:19,093 --> 01:35:20,458
Hey.

1450
01:35:20,661 --> 01:35:24,722
Hey, hey, man.
You better help your nigga, man.

1451
01:35:39,881 --> 01:35:41,508
Thank you.

1452
01:35:45,053 --> 01:35:46,816
- I didn't think it was going in.
- How'd it go?

1453
01:35:47,021 --> 01:35:48,921
Played it like a pro, man.

1454
01:35:49,123 --> 01:35:50,613
My mode is just...

1455
01:35:50,825 --> 01:35:52,884
Just pounding in my head now.

1456
01:35:53,094 --> 01:35:54,186
I mean, and it's...

1457
01:35:54,395 --> 01:35:56,625
It's hard in my heart right now.

1458
01:35:57,331 --> 01:35:59,265
All that boy gotta do is just
play the damn thing,

1459
01:35:59,467 --> 01:36:03,369
and it's gonna be undeniable, man.
Undeniable, baby.

1460
01:36:06,774 --> 01:36:10,733
I think you gonna have to get your
weed from some other hustler, man.

1461
01:36:11,712 --> 01:36:15,443
You're on your way.
You're on your way.

1462
01:36:18,653 --> 01:36:20,518
Hey...

1463
01:36:22,090 --> 01:36:24,149
...I got something for you.

1464
01:36:28,629 --> 01:36:31,928
Thank you for everything, man.

1465
01:36:34,402 --> 01:36:36,836
Let me get my jacket, man.

1466
01:36:41,109 --> 01:36:44,203
I'm gonna take me a piss,
and I'm gonna roll, baby.

1467
01:36:44,412 --> 01:36:46,505
You take care of yourself.

1468
01:36:46,714 --> 01:36:51,310
I will. Next time you see me, man,
I'm gonna be 100 feet tall, man.

1469
01:37:12,173 --> 01:37:14,266
Talking all this...

1470
01:37:14,475 --> 01:37:16,568
Shit, I can't...

1471
01:37:18,412 --> 01:37:20,972
Nigga talking to me.
I don't care about that shit, man.

1472
01:37:21,182 --> 01:37:23,446
Hey, Skinny, man.

1473
01:37:23,651 --> 01:37:26,085
You need to take a piss?

1474
01:37:26,287 --> 01:37:28,050
Hey, baby, let's try this shit
standing up.

1475
01:37:28,256 --> 01:37:29,223
Come on, man. Come on.

1476
01:37:29,423 --> 01:37:32,483
- Now, don't try...
- Come on. Big motherfucker.

1477
01:37:32,693 --> 01:37:34,991
Nigga talking to me
about his bullshit.

1478
01:37:35,196 --> 01:37:37,426
Nigga, I'm talking to you, man.

1479
01:37:37,632 --> 01:37:41,329
I'm talking to you, dog. You need
a little help, okay? Stay with me here.

1480
01:37:41,836 --> 01:37:44,896
I'm gonna pull your pants up, nigga.
I ain't no faggot or nothing.

1481
01:37:45,106 --> 01:37:47,438
You know, shit, ain't too many men

1482
01:37:47,642 --> 01:37:50,702
pull a nigga's dick up for him. Shit.

1483
01:37:51,345 --> 01:37:53,745
You better show me some love
for this one, man.

1484
01:37:53,948 --> 01:37:55,813
You know, one day...

1485
01:37:56,017 --> 01:37:57,985
One day, you and me
gonna be on tour, man.

1486
01:37:58,186 --> 01:37:59,983
- I ain't gonna do this shit for you.
- Tour?

1487
01:38:00,188 --> 01:38:01,815
- What tour you taking about?
- Shit, man.

1488
01:38:02,023 --> 01:38:03,217
Man, you know, a fucked-up nigga

1489
01:38:03,424 --> 01:38:06,086
would do some wild shit
to you right now.

1490
01:38:06,294 --> 01:38:09,229
Hey, hey, hey. Come on, man.
Come on, come on, come on.

1491
01:38:09,430 --> 01:38:11,830
Come on, baby.
Let's get the fuck up...

1492
01:39:00,915 --> 01:39:03,145
Hey, Skinny, man.

1493
01:39:03,718 --> 01:39:07,518
You tell me this shit
just fell out your pocket, man.

1494
01:39:11,859 --> 01:39:13,383
Skinny?

1495
01:39:13,594 --> 01:39:15,027
Hey, bitch.

1496
01:39:15,229 --> 01:39:17,026
You tell me this shit fell out
your pocket, man.

1497
01:39:17,231 --> 01:39:20,098
- Hey, hey, hey, man.
- Hey, what, man?

1498
01:39:20,301 --> 01:39:22,292
You know what you could do?

1499
01:39:22,503 --> 01:39:26,098
What can I do, man?
You tell me what I can do, man.

1500
01:39:27,041 --> 01:39:30,499
You can suck my dick, bitch.

1501
01:39:30,711 --> 01:39:33,908
Hey, bitch, why don't you
suck on this shit? Motherfucker!

1502
01:39:44,592 --> 01:39:46,116
This what the fuck you want, man?

1503
01:39:46,327 --> 01:39:48,693
This what the fuck you want, man?

1504
01:39:54,969 --> 01:39:56,903
Oh, shit.

1505
01:40:03,144 --> 01:40:04,475
Oh, God.

1506
01:40:04,679 --> 01:40:07,546
Oh, Skinny, man.
Hey. Hey, nigga.

1507
01:40:07,748 --> 01:40:10,683
Hey, Skinny! Hey, Skinny,
wake the fuck up, man!

1508
01:40:10,885 --> 01:40:13,217
Skinny, come on, man!
Come on, man. Come on, nigga.

1509
01:40:13,421 --> 01:40:15,753
Breathe, you motherfucker!

1510
01:40:15,956 --> 01:40:18,015
Hey, yo, Skin...
What the...?!

1511
01:40:18,993 --> 01:40:20,585
Shit!

1512
01:40:21,862 --> 01:40:23,830
Get the fuck up! Get your ass up!

1513
01:40:24,031 --> 01:40:25,999
Get your ass up, motherfucker!

1514
01:40:26,200 --> 01:40:27,690
- Oh, shit!
- Hey, motherfuckers,

1515
01:40:27,902 --> 01:40:28,869
I'm coming out now!

1516
01:40:29,070 --> 01:40:30,935
If I see any gleam, motherfuckers,

1517
01:40:31,138 --> 01:40:32,901
I'm gonna shoot this motherfucker
in his head!

1518
01:40:33,107 --> 01:40:34,199
- Shoot this nigga!
- Get him!

1519
01:40:34,408 --> 01:40:35,898
- Shoot this nigga!
- Fuck off, bitch!

1520
01:40:36,110 --> 01:40:37,737
Hey, niggas, back the fuck up!

1521
01:40:37,945 --> 01:40:40,846
- Not tonight, nigga! Not tonight!
- Shoot him! Shoot him!

1522
01:41:24,859 --> 01:41:26,292
There he is!
There that motherfucker go!

1523
01:41:26,494 --> 01:41:27,825
- Right there!
- Away from the door.

1524
01:41:28,028 --> 01:41:30,155
Hey, man, I ain't armed.
It's in the glove.

1525
01:41:30,364 --> 01:41:33,299
- It's in the glove, man.
- Djay! Djay!

1526
01:41:33,501 --> 01:41:35,526
Hey, wait, man! Hey, Shug, it's okay.
Hey, wait!

1527
01:41:35,936 --> 01:41:37,233
- Hey, get off my foot, man.
- Djay!

1528
01:41:37,438 --> 01:41:38,405
Hey lay off my foot, man!

1529
01:41:38,606 --> 01:41:40,403
- Fuck you, man! Hey, man!
- Get down on the car!

1530
01:41:40,608 --> 01:41:44,169
- Hey, get them off my girl!
- Hey, get your hands off her!

1531
01:41:44,378 --> 01:41:45,777
Hey, man!

1532
01:41:45,980 --> 01:41:47,811
- Fuck!
- What the fuck's up now, nigga?

1533
01:41:48,015 --> 01:41:50,575
- Bust his motherfucking head, man.
- Nigga, come on, come on.

1534
01:41:50,785 --> 01:41:52,616
Djay, please, what did you do?

1535
01:41:53,053 --> 01:41:55,419
Hey, man! Come on, man!
He turned himself in, man!

1536
01:41:55,890 --> 01:41:58,324
You ain't gotta dog-pile
on him like that!

1537
01:41:58,526 --> 01:42:00,858
Hey, yo, she pregnant, man!

1538
01:42:01,829 --> 01:42:03,694
Don't forget, man,
you knock this motherfucker out.

1539
01:42:03,898 --> 01:42:06,628
He's gonna have to come around here.

1540
01:42:06,967 --> 01:42:09,527
Djay, tell me what to do, please.

1541
01:42:09,737 --> 01:42:12,103
Please tell me what to do.

1542
01:42:12,306 --> 01:42:14,365
Baby, take my pad.

1543
01:42:15,075 --> 01:42:17,737
I want you to get that shit up
on the radio.

1544
01:42:17,945 --> 01:42:20,607
You put it in the DJ's hand
yourself, you hear me?

1545
01:42:20,815 --> 01:42:21,839
- Okay, I will.
- Get him up.

1546
01:42:22,049 --> 01:42:24,415
I got a stack of demos
right there in the car.

1547
01:42:24,618 --> 01:42:28,179
I want you to get Key and them...
Key, y'all put my shit on CD!

1548
01:42:28,389 --> 01:42:29,378
All right, man!

1549
01:42:30,424 --> 01:42:32,221
Nola, you in charge and shit,
all right?

1550
01:42:32,426 --> 01:42:35,418
In two weeks, I wanna hear my shit
in the yard at 2:01, you hear me?

1551
01:42:37,198 --> 01:42:39,792
- Get him!
- Motherfucker!

1552
01:42:41,268 --> 01:42:44,328
- Bitch!
- Don't hit him like that!

1553
01:42:45,139 --> 01:42:48,165
Get him! Bitch!

1554
01:42:48,375 --> 01:42:49,603
D!

1555
01:42:51,312 --> 01:42:53,746
I wanna hear my shit in the yard,
you hear me.

1556
01:42:53,948 --> 01:42:56,007
You in charge.
I wanna hear you say that.

1557
01:42:56,217 --> 01:42:57,844
- Say it!
- I'm in charge.

1558
01:42:58,052 --> 01:42:59,451
- You my partner.
- I know.

1559
01:42:59,653 --> 01:43:02,918
- Say, "I'm in charge!"
- I'm in charge!

1560
01:43:06,393 --> 01:43:08,258
- All right, man.
- Get in the car.

1561
01:43:08,596 --> 01:43:09,722
Watch your head.

1562
01:43:09,930 --> 01:43:12,057
I'm in charge.

1563
01:43:12,266 --> 01:43:13,392
Me. I promise.

1564
01:43:31,452 --> 01:43:33,682
Go get down in the yard.

1565
01:44:09,490 --> 01:44:12,516
I tried calling the house, you know...

1566
01:44:12,860 --> 01:44:16,489
...but the phone's just...
- They shut them off.

1567
01:44:18,966 --> 01:44:21,298
But me and Yevette, we...

1568
01:44:21,669 --> 01:44:23,432
We chipping in.

1569
01:44:23,771 --> 01:44:25,398
Thank you.

1570
01:44:32,846 --> 01:44:35,144
She precious, man.

1571
01:44:36,450 --> 01:44:38,247
Beautiful little girl.

1572
01:44:41,989 --> 01:44:44,549
- Named her Keisha.
- Keisha.

1573
01:44:46,160 --> 01:44:48,424
That's a good handle, man.

1574
01:44:48,696 --> 01:44:50,391
I like that.

1575
01:44:51,966 --> 01:44:53,957
You know, with all I gotta do...

1576
01:44:54,635 --> 01:44:57,661
...all these people in my life, man...

1577
01:44:59,707 --> 01:45:02,335
...feels like an eternity in here.

1578
01:45:03,577 --> 01:45:06,410
Can't seem to find my mode now.

1579
01:45:07,014 --> 01:45:09,312
Don't hear a damn thing.

1580
01:45:11,118 --> 01:45:12,745
Djay...

1581
01:45:18,158 --> 01:45:21,093
...did you know Skinny Black
before that night?

1582
01:45:28,769 --> 01:45:31,567
You know that
little girl Keisha, right?

1583
01:45:32,940 --> 01:45:35,238
One day she gonna dream big,

1584
01:45:35,442 --> 01:45:37,967
the way kids do, you know.

1585
01:45:38,345 --> 01:45:41,837
And she gonna come to me
and ask me

1586
01:45:42,049 --> 01:45:46,076
when she grow up,
can she become president?

1587
01:45:47,154 --> 01:45:51,022
Now, I know that little girl got a ho
for a mama and a trick for a daddy,

1588
01:45:51,225 --> 01:45:53,819
that nobody even know where he at.

1589
01:45:54,795 --> 01:45:56,888
But I tell you something.

1590
01:45:57,998 --> 01:46:00,364
I'm gonna look her right in the eye...

1591
01:46:01,201 --> 01:46:03,260
...and I'm gonna lie.

1592
01:46:04,004 --> 01:46:06,802
Because sometimes
that's what you gotta do.

1593
01:46:17,184 --> 01:46:19,618
How you been doing, man?

1594
01:46:24,391 --> 01:46:26,791
Back to the same old shit.

1595
01:46:26,994 --> 01:46:30,930
About six months ago,
my neighbor brought my mail.

1596
01:46:31,131 --> 01:46:34,157
It was mail that she'd gotten
from her neighbor.

1597
01:46:34,368 --> 01:46:35,858
It was addressed to me.

1598
01:46:36,070 --> 01:46:39,836
The court depositions
and the high school recitals.

1599
01:46:41,308 --> 01:46:43,708
Talk about eternity, man.

1600
01:46:44,745 --> 01:46:47,043
It's been on my mind too.

1601
01:46:49,583 --> 01:46:52,108
It's on all our minds.

1602
01:46:52,319 --> 01:46:54,981
We was just dead, Djay.

1603
01:46:55,522 --> 01:46:58,047
Locked up, just like you.

1604
01:46:59,793 --> 01:47:03,627
But ain't no sorrow gonna
take away Shug's song.

1605
01:47:03,831 --> 01:47:05,822
Let me tell you that.

1606
01:47:06,066 --> 01:47:08,728
That woman, she got love for you.

1607
01:47:09,937 --> 01:47:12,565
So when you talk about eternity...

1608
01:47:13,774 --> 01:47:15,969
...you think about your woman.

1609
01:47:18,912 --> 01:47:21,403
- Hey, how's Nola, man?
- Nola?

1610
01:47:22,583 --> 01:47:25,245
Let me tell you something, man.

1611
01:47:25,919 --> 01:47:28,683
That girl got a mode all her own.

1612
01:47:35,929 --> 01:47:37,897
She hit the bricks running.

1613
01:47:38,098 --> 01:47:41,795
For some reason, she got it stuck
in her head that she was in charge.

1614
01:47:42,002 --> 01:47:47,372
We can't lay around licking our ass
all day like a dog, you know?

1615
01:47:47,574 --> 01:47:50,168
I mean, we man.

1616
01:47:50,377 --> 01:47:55,246
I mean, I know I'm a girl and all,
but we mankind.

1617
01:47:55,916 --> 01:47:57,816
Man, she hit every shake joint,

1618
01:47:58,018 --> 01:48:01,317
radio station in Memphis
and then some.

1619
01:48:01,555 --> 01:48:03,386
I don't know how she did it.

1620
01:48:03,590 --> 01:48:06,150
That girl got skills.

1621
01:48:18,472 --> 01:48:20,406
Power 107. 1.
Number one for hip-hop.

1622
01:48:20,607 --> 01:48:22,370
This your man Boogaloo
holding you down.

1623
01:48:22,576 --> 01:48:25,545
Man, I got a brand-new exclusive
from my man Djay.

1624
01:48:25,746 --> 01:48:28,874
Straight from the north, north, north.
Put your thumbs up out there, man.

1625
01:48:29,082 --> 01:48:31,346
And I hear my man Djay...
Djay, you gotta call me,

1626
01:48:31,552 --> 01:48:34,715
let me know if it's true.
Did you slap Skinny Black?

1627
01:48:34,922 --> 01:48:36,116
Did you do it, man?

1628
01:48:36,323 --> 01:48:38,052
Holler at me, man.
Power 107. 1.

1629
01:48:38,258 --> 01:48:39,987
Brand-new, right here.

1630
01:48:41,628 --> 01:48:44,188
Hey, man, this is me!
I made this beat!

1631
01:48:49,169 --> 01:48:52,002
Whoop that trick
Whoop that trick

1632
01:48:52,206 --> 01:48:54,970
Whoop that trick
Whoop that trick

1633
01:48:58,612 --> 01:49:00,011
Whoop that trick

1634
01:49:01,982 --> 01:49:05,179
Whoop that trick
Whoop that trick

1635
01:49:07,487 --> 01:49:10,820
So if you don't mind,

1636
01:49:11,024 --> 01:49:12,423
Nola and I, we got a few points

1637
01:49:12,626 --> 01:49:15,891
we'd like to talk about
in regards to your agenda.

1638
01:49:17,197 --> 01:49:19,028
That's if you got a minute.

1639
01:49:23,770 --> 01:49:25,761
For you, Key...

1640
01:49:25,973 --> 01:49:28,134
...I got 11 months.

1641
01:49:48,896 --> 01:49:51,387
Hey, Al, hold up, hold up.

1642
01:49:51,598 --> 01:49:54,066
Ain't this the guy on the radio with
that "Whoop That Trick" song?

1643
01:49:54,268 --> 01:49:55,895
- What you talking about?
- Man, this the cat

1644
01:49:56,103 --> 01:49:58,537
who stomped on Skinny
with that "Whoop That Trick" song.

1645
01:49:58,739 --> 01:49:59,831
You know that song.

1646
01:50:00,040 --> 01:50:03,134
- Whoop that trick, get 'em
- Whoop that trick, get 'em

1647
01:50:03,343 --> 01:50:04,742
