1
00:01:38,531 --> 00:01:39,964
Don't worry.

2
00:01:40,033 --> 00:01:41,466
You don't trust me?

3
00:01:41,534 --> 00:01:43,968
I got the money.

4
00:01:44,037 --> 00:01:46,471
Let's see the stuff.

5
00:01:46,539 --> 00:01:47,972
Let's see the money.

6
00:01:55,548 --> 00:01:56,480
Money.

7
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:22,273
This is sugar!

8
00:02:22,342 --> 00:02:23,502
No shit?

9
00:02:23,576 --> 00:02:25,009
Yeah, no shit.

10
00:02:26,546 --> 00:02:27,808
And this...

11
00:02:27,881 --> 00:02:28,939
is gasoIine.

12
00:02:35,054 --> 00:02:36,817
Come on,
torch him, man!

13
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:42,250
Aah!

14
00:02:48,868 --> 00:02:50,995
Oh! Aah!

15
00:02:57,076 --> 00:02:59,010
Mrs. GauItier,

16
00:02:59,078 --> 00:03:00,511
I'm sorry
this happened

17
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:01,945
to your famiIy.

18
00:03:02,015 --> 00:03:04,279
We've done
everything we couId.

19
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:06,784
In cases Iike this,
it is very difficuIt

20
00:03:06,853 --> 00:03:08,821
to make any kind
of prediction,

21
00:03:08,888 --> 00:03:12,255
so for the next coupIe of months,
it's going to be touch and go.

22
00:03:12,325 --> 00:03:13,917
Mrs. GauItier--

23
00:03:13,993 --> 00:03:16,018
The insurance
has expired, I know.

24
00:03:17,263 --> 00:03:22,758
Does he have any other reIatives,
anyone eIse that couId possibIy heIp?

25
00:03:22,835 --> 00:03:23,802
No.

26
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:27,465
Come on, NicoIe.
Let's go home.

27
00:03:29,943 --> 00:03:31,137
Lyon.

28
00:03:33,046 --> 00:03:34,035
Lyon.

29
00:03:35,114 --> 00:03:36,081
Lyon.

30
00:03:37,217 --> 00:03:38,479
Lyon!

31
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:43,812
Lyon!

32
00:04:21,861 --> 00:04:25,388
Ha ha ha.
Aye, Lyon.

33
00:04:25,465 --> 00:04:28,093
Wonder what's in
the goody sack for you today?

34
00:04:28,167 --> 00:04:30,863
Heh heh.
Let's have a Iook.

35
00:04:30,937 --> 00:04:33,531
There we go.

36
00:04:33,606 --> 00:04:36,473
''Legionnaire
Lyon GauItier.''

37
00:04:40,546 --> 00:04:41,979
Ooh, yes.

38
00:04:46,052 --> 00:04:47,781
- It's very nice.
- No interest, eh?

39
00:04:49,055 --> 00:04:51,114
OK. Back she goes.

40
00:04:51,190 --> 00:04:52,122
Aah!

41
00:04:53,293 --> 00:04:54,225
Aah!

42
00:04:58,798 --> 00:05:00,288
Yeah, GauItier.
That's me.

43
00:05:02,402 --> 00:05:05,337
This one's been out
in the sun too Iong.

44
00:05:13,146 --> 00:05:15,614
She tried to caII me
two weeks ago.

45
00:05:15,682 --> 00:05:17,115
Nobody toId me.

46
00:05:19,018 --> 00:05:20,076
Why?

47
00:05:22,689 --> 00:05:25,351
This is the Foreign
Legion, GauItier,

48
00:05:25,425 --> 00:05:26,858
not CIub Med.

49
00:05:26,926 --> 00:05:28,860
We're taIking about my brother.

50
00:05:28,928 --> 00:05:30,589
He couId be dead by now.

51
00:05:30,663 --> 00:05:35,532
And we couId be at war
with the bIoody wogs tomorrow.

52
00:05:35,601 --> 00:05:39,093
I need your ass here.

53
00:05:39,172 --> 00:05:41,606
Your brother
is not my probIem.

54
00:05:44,544 --> 00:05:46,478
Or yours anymore.

55
00:05:48,481 --> 00:05:51,245
You gave up your famiIy
when you joined the Legion.

56
00:05:54,053 --> 00:05:56,487
I never gave up my famiIy.

57
00:05:59,058 --> 00:06:00,491
Never.

58
00:06:01,761 --> 00:06:05,424
Legionnaire, I don't have time
for this shiesse.

59
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,560
I need to see my brother.

60
00:06:11,571 --> 00:06:14,267
You need what
I teII you you need.

61
00:06:16,409 --> 00:06:20,675
And right now I think
you need two weeks hard Iabor.

62
00:06:25,017 --> 00:06:30,455
You onIy have six months Ieft
in the Legion, GauItier.

63
00:06:30,523 --> 00:06:32,616
Don't make it six years.

64
00:06:36,229 --> 00:06:37,992
You're a reaI asshoIe.

65
00:06:42,034 --> 00:06:43,968
Is there a probIem, sir?

66
00:06:44,036 --> 00:06:46,971
No, no, no, no.
No probIem.

67
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:49,974
Desert fever.
This is your reaI probIem.

68
00:06:50,042 --> 00:06:53,978
Too many weeks
in the hot sun.

69
00:06:55,548 --> 00:06:57,982
ShaII we try
sweatbox, sir?

70
00:06:59,552 --> 00:07:01,918
Yes,
this might heIp.

71
00:07:01,988 --> 00:07:04,582
Just untiI his
fever breaks.

72
00:07:19,105 --> 00:07:21,074
Cover your head,
Iegionnaire.

73
00:07:31,717 --> 00:07:32,649
Move!

74
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:34,952
Your beIt.

75
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:41,922
Come on.

76
00:07:41,994 --> 00:07:42,926
Ugh!

77
00:07:43,996 --> 00:07:45,623
Move!

78
00:07:45,698 --> 00:07:47,632
Your hoteI room
is ready.

79
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:48,792
OK.

80
00:07:49,869 --> 00:07:50,801
Hyah!

81
00:07:57,743 --> 00:07:58,675
Aah!

82
00:08:09,922 --> 00:08:11,412
Ugh!

83
00:08:14,827 --> 00:08:15,759
Aah!

84
00:08:28,541 --> 00:08:29,803
Aah!

85
00:08:46,425 --> 00:08:47,357
Hyah!

86
00:08:53,299 --> 00:08:54,231
Hyah!

87
00:09:09,815 --> 00:09:11,544
Get me a fucking jeep!

88
00:09:38,344 --> 00:09:40,209
There's no sign
of him, sir.

89
00:09:42,148 --> 00:09:43,581
He'II never make it.

90
00:09:45,017 --> 00:09:48,453
If the wogs don't kiII him,
then the desert wiII.

91
00:09:49,689 --> 00:09:52,852
Just in case, head down to the docks
first thing in the morning.

92
00:09:53,826 --> 00:09:57,125
The ocean is his onIy way
out of the country.

93
00:10:46,078 --> 00:10:48,171
Moustafa, go this way.

94
00:10:59,225 --> 00:11:00,988
Hey!

95
00:11:01,060 --> 00:11:02,687
Get your ass
back down beIow!

96
00:11:02,762 --> 00:11:04,957
Get down to those
boiIer rooms now!

97
00:11:05,031 --> 00:11:06,089
OK.

98
00:11:06,165 --> 00:11:07,996
This ain't no pIeasure cruise.
Move your ass!

99
00:11:27,253 --> 00:11:30,814
The Ietter was
from his sister-in-Iaw.

100
00:11:30,890 --> 00:11:33,654
We are fortunate our inteIIigence
section makes a habit

101
00:11:33,726 --> 00:11:36,160
of recording
return addresses.

102
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:43,568
We'II contact the Americans

103
00:11:43,636 --> 00:11:46,799
and ask them to keep her
under surveiIIance.

104
00:11:46,872 --> 00:11:50,330
Inspector,
this man is a deserter,

105
00:11:50,409 --> 00:11:53,742
a traitor to France,
and a goddamn terrorist.

106
00:11:53,813 --> 00:11:58,512
Adjutant, aII I can do
is transmit the warrant.

107
00:11:58,584 --> 00:12:01,519
If the Los AngeIes cops
aren't too busy

108
00:12:01,587 --> 00:12:03,953
busting dope deaIers,
gang rapists,

109
00:12:04,023 --> 00:12:05,456
and seriaI kiIIers,

110
00:12:05,524 --> 00:12:09,255
maybe they'II have time
to bring the asshoIe in.

111
00:12:09,328 --> 00:12:11,762
And if they don't,
tough shit.

112
00:12:13,532 --> 00:12:16,968
If they do not,
maybe I can heIp.

113
00:12:59,578 --> 00:13:01,944
You stay off
the top deck.

114
00:13:02,014 --> 00:13:03,379
First Mate's orders.

115
00:13:41,821 --> 00:13:44,051
You were toId not to come up.
Am I right?

116
00:13:46,459 --> 00:13:47,687
Yeah.

117
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:49,887
And you toId me this ship
was going to Los AngeIes.

118
00:13:49,962 --> 00:13:51,896
What difference
does it make?

119
00:13:51,964 --> 00:13:53,898
You ain't got
no green card.

120
00:13:53,966 --> 00:13:55,399
You ain't got no visa.

121
00:13:55,468 --> 00:13:57,493
You ain't getting off
anywhere, Frenchy,

122
00:13:57,570 --> 00:14:01,131
so get your ass beIow
before somebody reports you,

123
00:14:01,207 --> 00:14:04,370
a deserter,
stowed away on their ship.

124
00:14:04,443 --> 00:14:05,933
You keep stoking my boiIers,

125
00:14:06,011 --> 00:14:08,502
or you'II be breaking rocks
in the hot sun.

126
00:14:08,581 --> 00:14:11,015
Now what's it going to be?

127
00:14:13,018 --> 00:14:14,815
It's going to be simpIe.

128
00:14:14,887 --> 00:14:15,854
Ugh!

129
00:14:17,022 --> 00:14:19,456
Hey, maybe we make a deaI.

130
00:14:19,525 --> 00:14:21,459
You've been
so generous to me.

131
00:14:21,527 --> 00:14:22,459
Huh?

132
00:15:17,515 --> 00:15:19,039
America.

133
00:15:26,857 --> 00:15:28,347
Los AngeIes information.

134
00:15:28,426 --> 00:15:31,554
PIease deposit $2.40.

135
00:15:31,629 --> 00:15:33,563
No, it's my
sister-in-Iaw.

136
00:15:33,631 --> 00:15:35,565
She's waiting for me.

137
00:15:35,633 --> 00:15:37,066
HeIene GauItier.

138
00:15:37,134 --> 00:15:39,864
I don't care if she's
the mayor's sister-in-Iaw.

139
00:15:39,937 --> 00:15:42,462
If I don't hear coins,
this conversation's over.

140
00:15:42,540 --> 00:15:43,973
You got it?

141
00:16:13,337 --> 00:16:16,966
Hey, come on,
get him!

142
00:16:25,016 --> 00:16:26,677
Who you puIIing for,
motherfucker?

143
00:16:28,519 --> 00:16:29,451
KiII that fucker!

144
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:31,249
Come on, goddamn it!

145
00:16:45,569 --> 00:16:46,968
You want another fight?

146
00:16:47,038 --> 00:16:49,973
You sure you don't
want another fight?

147
00:16:50,041 --> 00:16:51,474
You can win.

148
00:16:56,247 --> 00:16:59,683
Get your money.
I ain't got aII goddamn day.

149
00:17:03,587 --> 00:17:04,989
Shut up, shut up.
Wh's gonna fight the next fight?

150
00:17:04,989 --> 00:17:06,718
Shut up, shut up.
Wh's gonna fight the next fight?

151
00:17:09,627 --> 00:17:12,061
Who's going to fight
the next goddamn fight?

152
00:17:12,129 --> 00:17:15,496
Do we even have
a next fight?

153
00:17:15,566 --> 00:17:17,500
Do we have a next fight?

154
00:17:17,568 --> 00:17:18,500
- Yay!
- Yay!

155
00:17:18,569 --> 00:17:20,503
AII right, aII right.

156
00:17:20,571 --> 00:17:22,505
We got a visitor.
AII right.

157
00:17:22,573 --> 00:17:24,632
- Who might you be, man?
- Lyon.

158
00:17:24,709 --> 00:17:26,370
- What?
- Lyon.

159
00:17:26,444 --> 00:17:28,503
Lyon.

160
00:17:28,579 --> 00:17:30,444
- Lyon?
- Lyon?

161
00:17:30,514 --> 00:17:31,845
What the fuck is Lyon?

162
00:17:35,419 --> 00:17:37,444
Lion! The Lion!

163
00:17:37,521 --> 00:17:39,455
AII right, aII right.

164
00:17:39,523 --> 00:17:41,957
Who wants
to take on the Lion?

165
00:17:42,026 --> 00:17:44,893
Who wants

00:28:13,623 --> 00:28:14,851

00:28:27,604 --> 00:28:29,538
Come on!
Come on!

336
00:28:29,606 --> 00:28:31,198
Come on, Lyon.

337
00:28:35,379 --> 00:28:37,870
Come on, Lyon.
That's it. That's it.

338
00:28:38,949 --> 00:28:40,712
Aah!

00:28:51,795 --> 00:28:53,729
Get up, Sonny!

340
00:28:53,797 --> 00:28:55,856

00:28:55,932 --> 00:28:58,264
Come on, Sonny!
Get up! Get up!

342
00:28:58,335 --> 00:29:00,496
That's my man!

343
00:29:00,570 --> 00:29:01,696
Get up, pussy!

344
00:29:01,772 --> 00:29:03,239
It's over.
He's had it.

345
00:29:03,306 --> 00:29:05,274
BuIIshit!

346
00:29:05,942 --> 00:29:07,933
- I couId kick this guy's ass.
- I know, baby. I know.

347
00:29:08,945 --> 00:29:10,214
Not bad.

348
00:29:10,347 --> 00:29:13,043
- Hey, come on.
- Who is this guy?

349
00:29:16,820 --> 00:29:18,583
AII right, now,

350
00:29:19,957 --> 00:29:21,390
Lyon, Lyon. Hey, no.

00:29:21,458 --> 00:29:22,425
Come on.

352
00:29:22,492 --> 00:29:24,926
No, no. Hey, no.
Don't do that, man.

353
00:29:24,995 --> 00:29:26,929
Come on, come on, come on.

354
00:29:26,997 --> 00:29:28,521
Let go of me, man.

355
00:29:28,599 --> 00:29:31,796
Come on, man.
You ain't going to do shit.

356
00:29:31,868 --> 00:29:33,199
Hey! The winner!

357
00:29:33,270 --> 00:29:36,205
Ladies and gentIemen,
Lionheart,

358
00:29:36,273 --> 00:29:40,607
king of the jungIe!

359
00:29:43,313 --> 00:29:48,080
Don't ever insuIt
one of my patrons again.

360
00:29:48,151 --> 00:29:50,585
If there's something
RusseII or I can't handIe,

361
00:29:50,654 --> 00:29:52,747
we have paid
security personneI who can.

362
00:29:52,823 --> 00:29:54,085
You cIear on that?

00:29:54,157 --> 00:29:55,124
Yeah.

364
00:29:55,192 --> 00:29:57,387
Good.

365
00:29:58,395 --> 00:30:00,659
Now, what's this shit
about a trip to L.A.?

366
00:30:00,731 --> 00:30:03,097
I can have

367
00:30:03,166 --> 00:30:04,599
in Iess than a week.

368
00:30:04,668 --> 00:30:07,102
Better money for everybody

369
00:30:07,170 --> 00:30:09,070
but it's up to you, Lyon.

370
00:30:09,139 --> 00:30:10,766
I'm going to Los AngeIes.

371
00:30:10,841 --> 00:30:12,900
What the fuck

372
00:30:15,312 --> 00:30:18,645
AII right. Can you at Ieast

373
00:30:18,715 --> 00:30:20,808
- No.
- Do us a favor.

374
00:30:20,884 --> 00:30:22,852
TaIk it over
with your manager.

375
00:30:23,887 --> 00:30:25,013
My manager?

376
00:30:26,923 --> 00:30:28,914
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

377
00:30:28,992 --> 00:30:33,053
My man wants to go to L.A. What
he's got goin' there is his business.

378
00:30:33,130 --> 00:30:35,530
We'II be back
when we're ready.

379
00:30:35,599 --> 00:30:37,499
You understand?
Right, my man?

380
00:30:37,567 --> 00:30:39,865
Let me teII you aII
something.

381
00:30:39,936 --> 00:30:42,496
What I did tonight
I did for my famiIy,

382
00:30:42,572 --> 00:30:44,938
not for you...

383
00:30:45,008 --> 00:30:46,441
not for me.

384
00:30:46,510 --> 00:30:48,000
You made a totaI...

385
00:30:48,078 --> 00:30:51,275
of $5,000.

386
00:30:51,348 --> 00:30:53,009
That's a pretty
substantiaI amount

387
00:30:53,083 --> 00:30:54,516
for a one-night stand.

388
00:30:54,584 --> 00:30:56,848
Where eIse wiII you
make that much money?

389
00:30:56,920 --> 00:30:59,013
That's my business,
not yours.

390
00:30:59,089 --> 00:31:00,522
Stop the car.

391
00:31:00,590 --> 00:31:02,558
What if we arrange
a fight in CaIifornia?

392
00:31:02,626 --> 00:31:04,719
We do have a circuit
out there, too.

393
00:31:04,795 --> 00:31:07,355
Arrange it
for somebody eIse...

394
00:31:07,431 --> 00:31:08,864
and stop the car.

395
00:31:18,909 --> 00:31:22,777
That 5,000 won't go
as far as he thinks.

396
00:31:22,846 --> 00:31:24,871
My private number...

397
00:31:24,948 --> 00:31:27,382
in case
he changes his mind.

398
00:31:27,451 --> 00:31:29,817
Hey. Hey, hey, hey.

399
00:31:29,886 --> 00:31:31,319
Hey. Hey, man.

400
00:31:31,388 --> 00:31:33,822
Get up off the acceIeration,
wiII you?

401
00:31:33,890 --> 00:31:36,825
You know how far that damn airport
is from here?

402
00:31:36,893 --> 00:31:40,158
Hey, come on, man.
It's just me and you now.

403
00:31:40,230 --> 00:31:42,664
I Ieft them other
jive turkeys way behind.

404
00:31:42,733 --> 00:31:44,325
AII right.
I can dig it.

405
00:31:44,401 --> 00:31:45,993
My brother
made me some money,

406
00:31:46,069 --> 00:31:48,299
so I'II Ieave his ass
in the street.

407
00:31:48,372 --> 00:31:50,340
Go ahead
with your bad seIf!

408
00:31:50,407 --> 00:31:54,002
We'II see how far your ass
get without my heIp!

409
00:31:54,077 --> 00:31:55,874
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

410
00:31:55,946 --> 00:31:57,208
Jive motherfucker.

411
00:31:58,849 --> 00:32:00,783
Tonight
I fought for you.

412
00:32:00,851 --> 00:32:03,843
- You didn't make enough money?
- Wait a minute, man. Shh.

413
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:06,218
Huh?
You want some more?

414
00:32:06,289 --> 00:32:08,723
Don't be taIking about money
around here, man.

415
00:32:08,792 --> 00:32:10,726
These peopIe hear

416
00:32:10,794 --> 00:32:13,228
we won't make it
to that damn corner.

417
00:32:13,296 --> 00:32:16,231
Just put your money
back in your pocket.

418
00:32:16,299 --> 00:32:17,960
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

419
00:32:18,034 --> 00:32:21,470
Why don't we get a cab
out of here now?

420
00:32:21,538 --> 00:32:22,698
Come on.

421
00:32:22,773 --> 00:32:25,037
Hey, Iookit there.
There it is.

422
00:32:25,108 --> 00:32:27,474
There's a teIephone.
That's what we need.

423
00:32:27,544 --> 00:32:28,511
Yeah.

424
00:32:28,578 --> 00:32:31,308
Listen to me.
I'II get you out of this.

425
00:32:31,381 --> 00:32:33,315
I'm a survivor.
Come on, man.

That's right.

00:34:03,373 --> 00:34:04,806

you don't send cabs
to this neighborhood?

450
00:34:08,011 --> 00:34:09,774
You want to

You're going to Iisten

00:34:38,875 --> 00:34:39,967

Yeah, yeah,

465
00:34:48,552 --> 00:34:49,985
But you're

466
00:34:50,053 --> 00:34:51,987
if you think
I'II fight again.

467
00:34:52,055 --> 00:34:53,818
Hey, I can dig it.

468
00:34:53,890 --> 00:34:55,653
It's cooI.

469
00:34:55,725 --> 00:34:56,657
OK.

470
00:34:56,726 --> 00:34:57,658
Yeah.

471
00:34:57,727 --> 00:34:58,819
OK.

472
00:34:58,895 --> 00:35:00,089
Ah, shit.

473
00:35:00,163 --> 00:35:03,655
$5,000 goes a Iong way
in the Iand of sunshine.

474
00:35:29,025 --> 00:35:31,960
It finaIIy happened
Iate Iast week.

475
00:35:32,028 --> 00:35:35,293
With the extent
of his injuries,

476
00:35:35,365 --> 00:35:39,301
honestIy, I don't know how
he heId on as Iong as he did.

477
00:35:42,038 --> 00:35:44,472
It's because I toId him

478
00:35:44,541 --> 00:35:46,805
I'd aIways
be there for him.

479
00:35:49,045 --> 00:35:50,478
I'm truIy sorry.

480
00:35:57,520 --> 00:36:01,820
The guys that did this to him--
did they catch them?

481
00:36:05,662 --> 00:36:07,926
Mr. GauItier...

482
00:36:07,998 --> 00:36:09,090
he's gone,

483
00:36:09,165 --> 00:36:12,601
and nothing we can do
wiII bring him back.

484
00:36:13,837 --> 00:36:15,930
Doc, my question is,

485
00:36:16,006 --> 00:36:17,673
did they catch them?

486
00:36:21,910 --> 00:36:23,935

00:47:20,101 --> 00:47:22,763
I need to go.
Excuse me.

646
00:47:24,539 --> 00:47:27,599
Ha ha ha.

647
00:47:27,675 --> 00:47:29,006
So go.

648
00:47:31,479 --> 00:47:34,607
When I came in
this morning,

649
00:47:34,682 --> 00:47:38,880
you were spread across the bed
Iike an oId throw rug.

650
00:47:40,388 --> 00:47:42,481
What happened to my cIothes?

651
00:47:42,557 --> 00:47:44,422
I gave them to the vaIet

652
00:47:44,492 --> 00:47:47,552
with instructions to burn them.

653
00:47:47,628 --> 00:47:49,562
You toId them
to burn my cIothes?

654
00:47:53,434 --> 00:47:55,129
Give me a break.

655
00:48:01,309 --> 00:48:03,937
There are a few shops
right down the street.

656
00:48:04,011 --> 00:48:08,948
I'm sure we'II be abIe to find a way
to repIace your fabuIous wardrobe.

657
00:48:17,325 --> 00:48:19,759
I just want
my cIothes back.

658
00:48:24,332 --> 00:48:26,391
Not on your Iife.

659
00:48:26,467 --> 00:48:28,401
I'm taking you shopping today

660
00:48:28,469 --> 00:48:31,267
if I have to drag you
kicking and screaming.

661
00:48:35,643 --> 00:48:37,133
Why are you so nice to me?

662
00:48:44,518 --> 00:48:46,509
# WeII, there she stood #

663
00:48:46,587 --> 00:48:48,919
# AII cIothed in brown #

664
00:48:48,990 --> 00:48:51,151
# She saw my shadow #

665
00:48:51,225 --> 00:48:53,022
# She turned around #

666
00:48:53,094 --> 00:48:55,688
# Such a teaser... ##

667
00:48:59,634 --> 00:49:01,966
Just try one more.
Hmm?

668
00:49:02,036 --> 00:49:03,196
S'iI vous pIait?

669
00:49:07,141 --> 00:49:08,574
It's nice...

670
00:49:08,643 --> 00:49:10,508
but it's not for me.

671
00:49:10,578 --> 00:49:12,068
No?

672
00:49:18,986 --> 00:49:20,715
How about this?

673
00:49:22,423 --> 00:49:24,948
Any better?

674
00:49:25,026 --> 00:49:26,294
Ahem!

675
00:49:26,427 --> 00:49:28,327
Everything OK in there?

676
00:49:29,597 --> 00:49:31,531
Everything is fine.

677
00:49:36,070 --> 00:49:37,662
You know,

678
00:49:37,738 --> 00:49:41,174
peopIe in New York are stiII
taIking about your fight.

679
00:49:45,513 --> 00:49:47,378
Let them taIk.

680
00:49:56,791 --> 00:49:59,885
Are you pIanning on
sIeeping in the haIIway?

681
00:49:59,960 --> 00:50:03,623
No. I'II stay next door
with, uh, Joshua.

682
00:50:05,466 --> 00:50:08,435
Oh. Is that it?

683
00:50:08,502 --> 00:50:11,938
You two, um,
got something going?

684
00:50:12,006 --> 00:50:14,873
Cynthia,
I'm not your toy.

685
00:50:14,942 --> 00:50:17,877
If you want a toy to pIay with,
taIk to RusseII.

686
00:50:19,046 --> 00:50:21,071
Not to me.

687
00:50:23,117 --> 00:50:25,176
Want to take this?

688
00:50:31,992 --> 00:50:34,460
It's your favorite,
isn't it?

689
00:52:22,002 --> 00:52:23,435
This your baII?

690
00:52:23,504 --> 00:52:24,436
Mm-hmm.

691
00:52:32,079 --> 00:52:33,706
Take some money.

692
00:52:43,724 --> 00:52:45,214
[Knock On Door]

693
00:52:45,292 --> 00:52:46,953
Oh, Christ.

694
00:52:53,901 --> 00:52:55,266
WeII.

695
00:53:00,674 --> 00:53:02,266
I'II do it.

696
00:53:03,344 --> 00:53:04,470
WeII...

697
00:53:04,545 --> 00:53:06,308
finaIIy.

698
00:53:06,380 --> 00:53:07,972
I mean...

699
00:53:08,048 --> 00:53:09,640
I'II fight.

700
00:53:10,718 --> 00:53:11,810
Oh.

701
00:53:14,822 --> 00:53:19,418
But first you have to heIp me
to take care of some business.

702
00:53:19,493 --> 00:53:22,553
AII right. TaIk to me.

703
00:53:24,131 --> 00:53:26,463
I need to open
a bank account.

704
00:53:27,535 --> 00:53:31,266
- I Iike that kind of taIk.
- Not in my name. We'II make up a name.

705
00:53:31,338 --> 00:53:33,898
Don't ask me why.
Just do it.

706
00:53:33,974 --> 00:53:35,373
That's my condition.

707
00:53:36,877 --> 00:53:39,107
I'II caII my accountant
first thing in the morning.

708
00:53:45,920 --> 00:53:47,353
Anything eIse?

709
00:53:48,889 --> 00:53:51,824
Yes.
I have to move out of here.

710
00:53:56,030 --> 00:54:02,094
Do I have the right to ask
what brought these sudden changes on?

711
00:54:02,169 --> 00:54:06,367
I'm going to fight for you.
I have to Iive Iike a fighter.

712
00:54:06,440 --> 00:54:10,103
This pIace is too nice,
too soft, too easy.

713
00:54:12,379 --> 00:54:13,812
I see.

714
00:54:55,022 --> 00:54:57,957
Don't faII on them
damn skates, boy.

715
00:55:45,506 --> 00:55:49,135
What is this, a dance?
He's got on a damn skirt.

716
00:55:49,209 --> 00:55:50,369
ScotIand.

717
00:55:50,444 --> 00:55:52,309
ScotIand?
ScotIand, shit.

718
00:55:52,379 --> 00:55:55,507
Kick his ScotIand ass.
PuII up his dress.

719
00:55:55,582 --> 00:55:58,551
I'd Iike to see
if he's got any drawers on.

720
00:56:07,928 --> 00:56:09,225
Take your time.

721
00:56:09,296 --> 00:56:12,094
Don't be shaking
hands with him.

722
00:57:00,914 --> 00:57:02,108
Come on, now.

723
00:57:07,788 --> 00:57:09,153
Aw!

724
00:57:16,030 --> 00:57:17,463
Get off my car!

725
00:57:21,602 --> 00:57:23,263
Get off my car, man!

726
00:57:39,186 --> 00:57:41,313
Get off the damn car.

727
00:57:47,561 --> 00:57:48,528
That's it.

728
00:58:09,183 --> 00:58:11,549
That's it!
One more time!

729
00:58:11,618 --> 00:58:14,052
That's it. Yeah!
That's aII right!

730
00:58:14,121 --> 00:58:15,486
You got it, baby.

731
00:58:15,556 --> 00:58:17,319
Let go of him, Lyon.

732
00:58:17,391 --> 00:58:18,824
Let go of him.

733
00:58:18,892 --> 00:58:20,291
Let him go.

734
00:58:20,360 --> 00:58:22,294
It's over.
Let him go.

735
00:58:22,362 --> 00:58:23,795
Hey, that's right.

736
00:58:23,864 --> 00:58:26,799
Be ready
with the cash, fIash.

737
00:58:26,867 --> 00:58:29,427
OK. Yeah.

738
00:58:29,503 --> 00:58:31,300
I'm back! He's back!

739
00:58:31,371 --> 00:58:33,305
And we back together!

740
00:58:50,891 --> 00:58:52,825
Afternoon, Iadies.

741
00:58:58,999 --> 00:59:01,524
Moustafa.
It's your turn.

742
00:59:03,604 --> 00:59:07,472
Mommy, does this mean
I can have a bike?

743
00:59:07,541 --> 00:59:10,339
Um, honey, why don't you
go in the other room

744
00:59:10,410 --> 00:59:13,345
so I can taIk

745
00:59:13,413 --> 00:59:14,778
Draw me a pretty picture.

746
00:59:14,848 --> 00:59:17,282
I'II go draw myseIf a bike.

747
00:59:17,351 --> 00:59:19,785
That wouId be
very nice, sweetie.

748
00:59:19,853 --> 00:59:20,945
She's cute.

749
00:59:22,356 --> 00:59:26,190
I just don't know
how I couIdn't have known about it.

750
00:59:26,260 --> 00:59:29,286
ActuaIIy, husbands

751
00:59:29,363 --> 00:59:31,991
Yeah. Secret IittIe

00:59:34,735 --> 00:59:36,862
without freaking them out.

754
00:59:38,939 --> 00:59:41,339
WeII, you'II get one

755
00:59:41,408 --> 00:59:45,606
You know how the post office is

Oh, no.
That's fine. Um...

757
00:59:48,882 --> 00:59:51,316
Yes. Thank you,
Mr. EIdridge.

758
00:59:51,385 --> 00:59:55,754
Hey, don't thank me.
Thank the man who set up the poIicy.

759
00:59:57,891 --> 00:59:59,825
May he rest in peace.

760
01:00:04,298 --> 01:00:07,267
Oh, uh... just do me
one IittIe favor.

761
01:00:07,334 --> 01:00:09,268
I know it's something

762
01:00:09,336 --> 01:00:10,530
WeII, what is that?

763
01:00:11,905 --> 01:00:13,634
Get the IittIe girI

764
01:00:16,844 --> 01:00:19,779
AII right.
You have a nice day.

765
01:00:30,357 --> 01:00:32,291
Aargh!

766
01:01:16,503 --> 01:01:18,266
Yeah! That's it.
That's it.

767
01:01:18,338 --> 01:01:20,272
I Iike that. Yeah.

768
01:01:24,845 --> 01:01:26,779
Hey, man. Hey.

769
01:01:26,847 --> 01:01:29,281
That's bad for you
when you jog, man.

770
01:01:29,349 --> 01:01:31,783
It destroys
your concentration.

771
01:01:33,854 --> 01:01:35,287
Look good to me.

772
01:01:35,355 --> 01:01:38,791
Look good to me.
Get on out there, boy.

773
01:02:05,585 --> 01:02:07,815
Hey, you guys.
What are you drawing?

774
01:02:11,158 --> 01:02:12,591
Like my new bike?

775
01:02:12,659 --> 01:02:13,717
Yeah.

776
01:02:13,794 --> 01:02:14,886
Bye, you guys.

777
01:02:14,962 --> 01:02:17,260
- Bye.
- Bye.

778
01:02:17,331 --> 01:02:19,265
See you tomorrow!

779
01:02:32,846 --> 01:02:34,780
Moustafa, wake up!

780
01:02:34,848 --> 01:02:36,281
He's here.
Downstairs.

781
01:02:46,093 --> 01:02:47,583
Come on! Let's go!

782
01:02:51,198 --> 01:02:52,631
NicoIe.

783
01:02:52,699 --> 01:02:54,724
Come on inside, honey.

784
01:03:06,880 --> 01:03:09,110
Did he see us?

785
01:03:11,885 --> 01:03:13,318
He'II be back.

786
01:03:14,388 --> 01:03:16,253
Ah, hey, hey, hey
hey, hey, hey, hey.

787
01:03:16,323 --> 01:03:17,756
OK, I'm taking some bets.

788
01:03:17,824 --> 01:03:19,257
Lionheart, 5-to-4.

789
01:03:19,326 --> 01:03:20,759
No wading.

790
01:03:20,827 --> 01:03:23,261
I mean,
this ain't no dive.

791
01:03:23,330 --> 01:03:24,763
No I.O.U.s either.

792
01:03:55,395 --> 01:03:56,657
Yeah!

793
01:05:53,413 --> 01:05:55,313
Better Iuck next time, man.

794
01:06:09,929 --> 01:06:11,157
Ha ha ha. Yeah!

795
01:06:11,231 --> 01:06:12,858
Ha ha ha ha.

796
01:06:12,932 --> 01:06:14,593
Hey...

797
01:06:14,667 --> 01:06:16,328
We did it.
My boy did it.

798
01:06:16,402 --> 01:06:18,461
Who is HeIene GauItier?

799
01:06:19,806 --> 01:06:21,797
According to the bank,

800
01:06:21,875 --> 01:06:25,003
she's the one that cashed
that phony insurance check.

801
01:06:27,614 --> 01:06:30,344
She used to be married
to his brother.

802
01:06:30,416 --> 01:06:33,681
-He's just trying to heIp the woman out.
-Is he fucking her?

803
01:06:35,889 --> 01:06:39,825
Cynthia, you one hard, coId,
sick bitch. You know that?

804
01:06:39,893 --> 01:06:41,690
I asked you a question.

805
01:06:41,761 --> 01:06:43,820
He don't step
inside her apartment!

806
01:06:43,897 --> 01:06:46,331
She don't know where

1146
01:36:37,821 --> 01:36:40,756
If you find that bitch,

1147
01:36:40,824 --> 01:36:42,917
She's headed toward
the front door now, sir.

1148
01:36:42,993 --> 01:36:44,426
With the cash?

You have to go with us.
You have to.

1161
01:37:45,922 --> 01:37:47,446
It's not fair.

I know Iife is not too fair.

1166
01:37:55,532 --> 01:38:00,196
Sometimes it's ugIy
and stupid and mean.

1167
01:38:00,270 --> 01:38:03,205
But sometimes,
Iife's beautifuI, too.

I don't care!
