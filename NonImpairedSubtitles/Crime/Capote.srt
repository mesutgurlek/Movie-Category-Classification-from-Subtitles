1
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:19,640
This is before she had us.

2
00:01:19,675 --> 00:01:21,800
Before she started drinking.

3
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:25,640
Who took care of you
as a child?

4
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:28,520
Orphanage.

5
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:31,400
Me and Linda.

6
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:33,320
And that's your sister?

7
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:47,240
You know, we're not so
different as you might think.

8
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:51,080
Yeah, I was abandoned
repeatedly as a child.

9
00:01:56,840 --> 00:02:00,920
My mama would drag me along
to some new town,

10
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:04,960
so she could take up
with another man she'd met.

11
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,840
Night after night, she'd lock
me in the hotel room alone.

12
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:12,200
Mama would turn the latch
and tell the staff

13
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:14,120
not to let me out
no matter what.

14
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:19,400
And I was terrified.

15
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:25,640
And I’d scream my head off...

16
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,840
until finally I’d collapse

17
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:36,200
on the carpet next to the
door and I’d fall asleep.

18
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:41,480
Then after years of this,

19
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:43,360
she just left me

20
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:46,760
with relatives in Alabama.

21
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:51,080
Who raised you up?

22
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:53,960
My aunts.

23
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:59,200
And that's where I met Nelle.

24
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:02,120
And she lived...
she lived next door.

25
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:10,760
Your mother was Indian?

26
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:13,120
Cherokee.

27
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:16,040
So drinking was not
a good thing for her.

28
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:18,920
No tolerance for it.

29
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:32,840
We're on, uh, suicide watch.

30
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:36,680
That's why they leave
the lights on at night.

31
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:39,080
I hope
we're past that now.

32
00:03:39,115 --> 00:03:40,040
I do.

33
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:53,480
Be careful of Ricardo.

34
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:57,760
I think he wants you
all to himself.

35
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:59,200
All right.

36
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:01,160
But he's
naturally mendacious.

37
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:04,040
Not to be trusted.

38
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:07,400
If he had $100, he'd steal
a stick of chewing gum.

39
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:20,360
Perry, I want to take
your notebooks with me.

40
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:24,200
I want to read them.

41
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:28,520
If I leave here
without understanding you,

42
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:32,840
the world will see you
as a monster

43
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:34,280
always.

44
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:39,080
I don't want that.

45
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:04,040
'Cause he trusts me.

46
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:06,280
I mean,
that's why he gave it to me.

47
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:10,600
And he-he's given me
absolutely everything.

48
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:14,440
And he wants so badly
to be taken seriously

49
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:16,840
to be held in some esteem.

50
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:17,800
Do you?

51
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:19,165
Do I what?

52
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:21,640
Do you hold him
in esteem, Truman?

53
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:25,000
Well,

54
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:28,840
he's a gold mine.

55
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:33,160
And he's told me
his entire life.

56
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:34,600
His, uh,

57
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:36,480
his dead mother.

58
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:39,400
Uh, he had a brother
and a sister kill themselves.

59
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:40,840
Awful.

60
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:44,200
Did you tell him
your mama did the same thing?

61
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:45,640
See, I can't tell him
everything.

62
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:48,520
We've been talking our
heads off for the past month.

63
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:50,440
And sometimes when I...

64
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:56,200
when I think how good my book
can be, I can hardly breathe.

65
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:04,840
Anyway, th-this is... this is
what I wanted to read to you.

66
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:05,800
Uh,

67
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:07,920
"if called upon
to make a speech... "

68
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:09,640
"if called upon
to make a speech"?

69
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:13,000
I mean, this is exactly
what I’m talking about.

70
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:17,560
A speech, just in case he's ever
recognized for an achievement.

71
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:21,640
"I can't remember what I was
going to say for the life of me.

72
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:23,560
"I don't think ever
before have so many people

73
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:25,440
"been so directly responsible

74
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:27,840
"for my being
so very, very glad.

75
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:30,280
"It's a wonderful moment
and a rare one.

76
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:33,120
Thank you!"

77
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:35,560
There's... there's an exclamation
point at the end of that "thank you"

78
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,480
in case you didn't catch it.

79
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:42,280
Where'd you go?

80
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:47,560
I guess it
stopped being funny.

81
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:49,480
I... I never said it was.

82
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:52,360
But, wait,
listen to this.

83
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,200
I was 14.

84
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:58,600
One day I said to him,
"mom's dead. " I could see it.

85
00:06:58,635 --> 00:07:00,320
A week later we got the news.

86
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:01,600
She finally drunk
herself...

87
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:02,920
...found her shivering...

88
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:05,320
she hit me so many times
with that flashlight,

89
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:06,760
she broke it.

90
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:08,200
That night, I... I dreamed
about that big yellow bird.

91
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:10,120
Clawed that nun's eyes,
bright like the sun.

92
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:12,000
Lifted me to the sky.

93
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:14,920
Sometimes you see a thing
how it really is.

94
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:24,040
Well, you're nothing
if not hardworking.

95
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:25,960
Hey, you look good.
Healthy again.

96
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:32,680
You know, I’ve decided
on a title for my book.

97
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:35,720
I think you'll like it.

98
00:07:35,755 --> 00:07:37,360
It's very masculine.

99
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:39,720
In cold blood.

100
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:42,160
Isn't that good?

101
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:45,480
And that refers to the crime

102
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:48,840
or the fact that you're still
talking to the criminals?

103
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:54,120
Oh, the former,
among other things.

104
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:56,520
I see.

105
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:03,680
I wanted to ask

106
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:07,560
if you'd let me look
at your investigation notes.

107
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:10,400
That lawyer you helped find
for your friends

108
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:13,320
got them a hearing at
the Kansas supreme court...

109
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:14,720
yeah, I heard this morning.

110
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:17,160
...on the issue
of inadequate counsel.

111
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:25,280
Alvin,

112
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:29,160
I mean, do you not want
me to look at your notes?

113
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:31,080
You are permitted to say no.

114
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:40,120
I'll tell you what.

115
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:43,000
If those boys get off,

116
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:46,360
I’m coming to Brooklyn
to hunt you down.

117
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:51,120
I have to be in court
at 9:00,

118
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:55,000
but you call Roy Church and he'll
show you what you want to see.

119
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:00,240
Thank you.

120
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:03,520
It's as much for me
as for anyone.

121
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:07,160
I couldn't bear the thought
of losing you so soon.

122
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:10,720
We're gonna be able to
use your book for our case.

123
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:13,640
You... you'll write we never
got to raise an insanity plea.

124
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:17,960
You wrote how terrible
the lawyers was.

125
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:23,240
I... I haven't written
a word yet.

126
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:33,800
What have you been doing?

127
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:37,640
Research. Talking to you.

128
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:43,840
All right.

129
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:44,800
I... I had hoped...

130
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:46,280
wh-what are you calling it?

131
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:50,120
The book?

132
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:53,960
I have no idea.

133
00:09:57,800 --> 00:10:00,165
Perry,

134
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:02,560
if I’m going to
write about you,

135
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:06,920
if I’m going to determine
how to write about you,

136
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:09,800
we need to talk about,

137
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:12,680
you know, why you're here.

138
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:15,560
And,

139
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,440
you know, the murders,

140
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:20,765
and that night

141
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:22,280
at the clutter house.

142
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:33,800
Do you worry
what I’ll think?

143
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:35,240
Is that it?

144
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:40,480
Dick says you know
Elizabeth Taylor.

145
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:44,360
I know a lot of people.

146
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:55,400
Perry, I have invitations
to be in morocco, Greece,

147
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:59,720
and I prefer to be here

148
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:01,160
with you.

149
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:11,445
Jack, be patient with me.

150
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:14,560
I'm just missing
this one piece.

151
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:16,480
Well, how long
is that gonna take?

152
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:18,880
Why don't you just try
leaving him alone for a while?

153
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:20,800
Come to Spain.

154
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:22,760
You can always
visit him later.

155
00:11:22,795 --> 00:11:24,640
I don't know.

156
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:27,560
Well, I’m off. I'm just...
I’ve got my own writing to do.

157
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:30,680
Well, do it in Brooklyn.
Wait for me.

158
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:33,760
There's too many
people around. I've...

159
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:35,720
I’ll leave the address
on the kitchen table.

160
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:41,000
Well, think about what I
said, and join me when you can.

161
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:43,840
I will.

162
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:44,840
I will.
Ok?

163
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:46,280
Bye.

164
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:10,280
Hi.

165
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:33,280
Truman.

166
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:36,160
We never intended
on killing that family.

167
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:38,080
Capote,

168
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:40,440
will you get that straight
in your book, please?

169
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:42,360
No premeditation.

170
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:44,560
What are you doing?

171
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:46,200
I have to fly back east.

172
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:48,640
When?

173
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:52,240
An hour.
I miss you already.

174
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:54,840
Write me every 5 minutes.

175
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:57,760
Hey, you know, we never did
intend on killing that family.

176
00:12:57,800 --> 00:12:58,720
Capote?

177
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:01,080
Capote?

178
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:45,640
What?

179
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:47,120
Truman,

180
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:50,000
I’ve not been able to tear
myself away from your book.

181
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:52,840
It's that good.

182
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:54,760
It's... it's not good,
it's astonishing.

183
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:57,680
This first half is
astonishing. Oh, thank you.

184
00:13:57,720 --> 00:13:59,560
When will you be done,
do you think?

185
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:02,480
Yes, I... I’m already
well into the third part.

186
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:03,845
But I...

187
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:06,520
I can't finish that
till I convince Perry

188
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:09,560
to describe the night
of the killings to me.

189
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:12,560
I was... I was planning
to visit this fall, see?

190
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:14,480
Then I think you need
to talk to him now.

191
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:18,560
And we all need to see how
this ends for the final part.

192
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:22,160
I... I... I can't finish the book
till I know what happens.

193
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:25,480
If Perry and Dick
are executed, it's one thing.

194
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:26,920
And if not, weli...

195
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:28,880
Truman,
you've got your ending.

196
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:29,800
I really don't know.

197
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:32,240
The Kansas court
denied their appeal.

198
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:34,600
It came over the wire
on Friday.

199
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:38,000
I mean, you need to
talk to Perry now.

200
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:40,360
He'll be dead by September.

201
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:46,160
I mean, I’m sorry. I know how
much you've come to care about him.

202
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:52,840
Right. Yes, right.

203
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:56,720
So I want to set up a reading
for you in the fall, in New York,

204
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:58,640
and, uh, well,
we'll build some interest,

205
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:00,560
and we'll publish
in the fall.

206
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:18,120
Thank god.
There's nothing in the house.

207
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:20,920
Why aren't you working?

208
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:24,200
Well, I knew you couldn't be
counted on to stock the kitchen.

209
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:28,000
What are we going to feed
our famous guest?

210
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:32,840
Oh, Jesus,
I completely forgot.

211
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:35,720
Plus, I, uh,
finished my novel yesterday.

212
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:37,840
What?

213
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:54,720
When was the last time
you wrote to him?

214
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:56,640
I don't know.

215
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:01,845
What's this?

216
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:04,680
It's a letter for Truman
I was asked to deliver.

217
00:16:04,715 --> 00:16:06,120
It's from Perry.

218
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,440
Let's have it.

219
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:21,600
"Dear friend Truman,
where are you?

220
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:24,520
"Read this item
in a medical dictionary.

221
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:29,320
'Death by hanging
is caused by asphyxia,

222
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:32,200
'by fracture of
the cervical vertebrae,

223
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:35,320
'by laceration
of the trachea. '

224
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:38,160
"Not too comforting,
as we lost our appeal.

225
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:40,560
"Missing you.

226
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:43,320
"Alone and desirous
of your presence.

227
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:47,565
Your amigo, Perry. "

228
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:50,520
Mr. Shawn told me about the
court decision yesterday.

229
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:54,360
I was wondering why you were
in such a good mood.

230
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:57,600
That's
a terrible thing to say.

231
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,880
I... I write him all the time
I’ve just...

232
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:04,800
I’ve been so focused on-
- on the book lately.

233
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:23,200
So Jack thinks
I’m using Perry,

234
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:27,600
but he also thinks I fell in love
with him when I was in Kansas.

235
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:30,920
Now, how both of those things
can be true is beyond me.

236
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:32,880
Thank you.

237
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:38,640
Well, did you?

238
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:40,560
Did you fall in love
with him?

239
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:44,400
I don't know
how to answer that.

240
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:45,800
Truman.

241
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:52,080
It's as if Perry and I
grew up in the same house,

242
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:57,840
and one day he stood up
and went out the back door

243
00:17:58,760 --> 00:18:00,680
while I went out the front.

244
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:04,080
Are you kidding me?

245
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:05,040
No.

246
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:11,280
Listen, you be nice to Jack.

247
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:14,160
Sometimes I think he's
what I like about you best.

248
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:17,480
I'll see you
at the reading in New York.

249
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:23,200
16th.

250
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:25,160
Adios.

251
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:44,400
What was he in jail for?

252
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:48,280
Well, they said it was
for not paying his taxes,

253
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:50,680
but really,
for being an outsider.

254
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:54,480
Refusing to go along.

255
00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:55,920
Lowell, you're being moved.

256
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:56,880
Why?

257
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:59,320
You're going to final holding. No.

258
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:02,200
Come on, Lowell.
Open the door.

259
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:09,840
Stand up.

260
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:11,320
Put your arms
behind your back.

261
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:12,780
Ok, last chance.

262
00:19:12,815 --> 00:19:14,200
Well, get up.
Ah!

263
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:15,120
Turn around.

264
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:17,080
Put your arms
behind your back.

265
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:36,760
Now Dick and me,
we're next in line.

266
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:43,960
I'm so sorry I’ve been away.

267
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:48,760
It was a long time.

268
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:52,080
I know.

269
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:57,880
How's the book coming along?

270
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:01,240
Oh, very slowly.

271
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:05,520
Will you show it to me?

272
00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:07,960
I've hardly written anything.

273
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:35,800
Good evening, New Yorkers,

274
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:39,720
and thank you for coming
to the first public reading,

275
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:42,120
the first offering
of any kind,

276
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:45,480
of Truman Capote's new work,
in cold blood.

277
00:20:58,920 --> 00:21:01,320
Hello.
My name is Truman Capote.

278
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:05,400
For this...
for this evening's program,

279
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:07,940
I’m going to read, uh,
some passages

280
00:21:07,975 --> 00:21:10,440
from the first 3 parts
of my new book.

281
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:17,640
"The village of Holcomb

282
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:21,480
"stands on the high wheat
plains of western Kansas,

283
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:24,800
"a lonesome area that other
Kansans call 'out there. '

284
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:29,600
"Until one morning
in mid-November, 1959,

285
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:34,440
"few Americans, in fact, few
Kansans, had ever heard of Holcomb.

286
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:36,840
"Like the waters
of the Arkansas river,

287
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:39,240
"like the motorists
on the highway,

288
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:42,120
"exceptional happenings
never stopped there.

289
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:57,480
"Perry Smith's voice
was both gentle and prim.

290
00:21:58,440 --> 00:21:59,880
"A voice that, though soft,

291
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:03,680
"manufactured
each sound exactly,

292
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:08,040
"ejected it like a smoke ring
issuing from a parson's mouth.

293
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:15,960
"The 4 coffins,
which quite filled

294
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,080
the small,
flower-crowded parlor

295
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:20,520
"were to be sealed
at the funeral services,

296
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:23,360
"very understandably,

297
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:26,760
"for the effect
was disquieting.

298
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:31,080
"Nancy wore her dress
of cherry-red velvet,

299
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:33,960
"her brother
a bright plaid shirt.

300
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:36,800
"The parents
were more sedately attired,

301
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:41,600
"Mr. Clutter in navy-blue flannel,
his wife in navy-blue crepe.

302
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:46,440
"And it was this especially that
lent the scene an awful aura,

303
00:22:46,475 --> 00:22:49,320
"the head of each was
completely encased in cotton.

304
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:51,680
"A swollen cocoon

305
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:54,600
"twice the size of
an ordinary blown-up balloon.

306
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:56,960
"And the cotton,

307
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:00,360
"because it had been sprayed
with a glossy substance,

308
00:23:00,395 --> 00:23:02,760
"twinkled like
Christmas tree snow.

309
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:09,000
"One Tuesday at dawn,
a carload of strangers,

310
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:11,360
"ignorant
of the local disaster,

311
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:14,280
"were startled by what they
saw as they crossed the prairies

312
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:16,200
"and passed through Holcomb.

313
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:18,560
"Windows ablaze.

314
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:21,440
"Almost every window
in almost every house,

315
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:24,840
"and in the brightly-lit
rooms, fully-clothed people,

316
00:23:24,875 --> 00:23:26,760
"even entire families,

317
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:32,040
"who had sat the whole night
wide awake watchful, listening.

318
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:34,440
"Of what
were they frightened?

319
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:37,320
It might happen again. "

320
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:41,160
Thank you.

321
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:06,040
And I slipped
and I ripped a hole

322
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:08,400
from the bottom
of my scrotum...

323
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:12,680
All the way up to the top
of the crack of my ass.

324
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:15,560
And I sat there.

325
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:18,440
And I didn't know it.
All I felt was a...

326
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:21,840
I... I didn't know it. All I felt was
a cool breeze you know, between my...

327
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:27,120
Sorry. If I may, uh...

328
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:30,000
yes.

329
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:33,840
Your portrait of those men
was terrifying.

330
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:35,760
Terrifying.

331
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:39,120
Thank you.

332
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,880
Stop that man!
Come back here!

333
00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:46,240
Dad!

334
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:52,040
Have any of you
met my father?

335
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:58,800
He hasn't spanked me
in years.

336
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:02,640
George didn't come backstage.

337
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:04,520
He had... he had a...

338
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:07,440
something that his wife
had to rush him off to.

339
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:08,805
But he made a point of...

340
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:11,280
yeah, well, I’m still wal...
I’m still waiting for a call.

341
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:13,680
It was beautiful. And everybody
came. Hmm. Tennessee...

342
00:25:13,715 --> 00:25:15,120
everybody came.
Tennessee loved it.

343
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:16,560
Of course he loved it.

344
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:19,400
Should we do more?

345
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:22,320
No, we... we just sit and wait
while people talk about it

346
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:25,600
and we let them do the work.

347
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:29,480
I mean, this... this book is
going to change everything.

348
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,880
It's gonna change
how people see your writing.

349
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:38,640
I think it's going to Chan
how people write.

350
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,360
Are you gonna be finished
by October?

351
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:45,840
I think so.

352
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:51,600
You know, they're scheduled
for next month.

353
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:52,560
To hang.

354
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:55,400
Yeah.

355
00:25:55,440 --> 00:26:00,200
We're gonna commit as many
issues as it takes to publish.

356
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:02,080
Whatever it takes.

357
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:04,560
Well, I’m going to Kansas
tomorrow, and...

358
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:07,440
and I’ll get Perry to talk.

359
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:09,360
What's he got to lose?

360
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:13,200
Sorry, but...

361
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:19,880
hey, this may
sound strange to you,

362
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:23,020
but I’m going to miss him.

363
00:26:23,055 --> 00:26:25,200
You'll be able to finish now.

364
00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:49,240
Need to check your
papers, sir.

365
00:26:53,080 --> 00:26:54,480
This is what we've been
waiting for.

366
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,360
A stay of execution
to make a federal appeal.

367
00:26:57,400 --> 00:26:59,320
All thanks to you.

368
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:03,120
Thank you!

369
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:04,560
They're not gonna
corner me now.

370
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:07,480
Not unless the U.S.
Government says so.

371
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:10,360
Kansas has had it in
for me for 10 years.

372
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:12,760
They can't corner me now.
Mmm-mmm.

373
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:14,680
Hey, Perry, sit down

374
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:17,080
for a minute.

375
00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:23,800
I... I need you to talk to me.

376
00:27:24,280 --> 00:27:26,200
We've got all the time
in the world to talk.

377
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:28,080
I've been
thinking about Ricardo.

378
00:27:28,120 --> 00:27:31,000
You really need to stop
sending him those trashy books.

379
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:34,360
I won't even
mention the pornography.

380
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:36,240
Now, I realize that

381
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:39,160
Dick probably can't grasp the
literature that you gave me.

382
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:42,240
Uh, the books you
send him only...

383
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:45,280
they only exacerbate
the problem.

384
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:48,240
They only heighten
or intensify it.

385
00:27:48,280 --> 00:27:50,200
Maybe we can get him
started on a program. Perry,

386
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:52,560
I know what
"exacerbate" means.

387
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,400
Ok, well, just thinking...

388
00:27:56,440 --> 00:27:58,360
there... there's not
a word or a sentence

389
00:27:58,840 --> 00:28:01,480
or a concept that you
can illuminate for me.

390
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:04,120
There is one singular reas
I keep coming here.

391
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:07,480
Truman.
November 14, 1959.

392
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:10,840
3 years ago. 3 years.

393
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:13,680
Hmm?

394
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:16,600
And that's... that's all
I want to hear from you.

395
00:28:22,840 --> 00:28:25,240
Now I asked you not to. Ever.

396
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:28,600
This is absurd.

397
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:30,960
Do you know
what absurd means?

398
00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:37,720
I'm ready.
I have a plane to catch.

399
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:40,560
I found your sister
in Tacoma.

400
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:43,480
Maybe she'll talk to me
about something useful.

401
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:48,760
Please don't go out there.

402
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:53,560
Hey, this is my work, Perry.

403
00:28:53,595 --> 00:28:55,440
I'm working.

404
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:58,840
And when you want to tell what
I need to hear, you let me know.

405
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:11,080
June's dead.

406
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:12,760
Frank shot himself.

407
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:16,600
Now Perry did what he did.

408
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,880
I used to love him.
He was my little doll.

409
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:24,720
He scares me now.

410
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:26,680
When was the last time
you saw him?

411
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:28,600
10 years ago.

412
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:31,000
10 years.

413
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:39,640
Could I borrow
one of these pictures?

414
00:29:40,120 --> 00:29:43,000
Take the whole thing.
I don't want them anymore.

415
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:47,280
Don't be taken in
by my brother.

416
00:29:47,320 --> 00:29:49,240
He's got this sensitive side
he'll show.

417
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:52,560
You believe he's gentle
and so easily hurt,

418
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:56,440
but he'd just as soon kill you as
shake your hand. I believe that.

419
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:06,360
Hello, handsome.

420
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:44,760
What's the name of your book?

421
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:55,280
What's the name of your book?

422
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:57,720
I don't know
what you're talking about.

423
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:10,160
"Truman Capote read last
night before a packed audience

424
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:15,480
"from his nonfiction
book in cold blood.

425
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:22,680
"The true-crime novel tells
of killers Richard Hickock

426
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:24,600
"and Perry Smith,

427
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:29,400
who brutally murdered
a Kansas family 3 years ago. "

428
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:33,200
Wait, who sent that to you?

429
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:35,120
That's not
your goddamn business.

430
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:37,560
It is my business,
because it's not true.

431
00:31:37,595 --> 00:31:39,960
The organizers of
the reading needed a title.

432
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,840
They picked one,

433
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:44,280
a sensational one, I admit,

434
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:45,720
to attract a crowd.

435
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,920
They picked it?

436
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:53,880
Yes.

437
00:31:55,320 --> 00:31:56,720
It's not your title.

438
00:31:56,760 --> 00:31:59,160
Perry,
I haven't chosen one yet.

439
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:02,000
How could I choose a title

440
00:32:02,040 --> 00:32:03,960
when we still haven't
talked about that night?

441
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:08,600
How could I?
I couldn't possibly.

442
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:16,720
You pretend to be my friend.

443
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:19,160
I'm sorry.

444
00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:23,000
I should have told you.

445
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:26,840
And I couldn't pretend
to be your friend

446
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:31,080
'cause the truth is,
I can't help wanting to be.

447
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:38,240
You don't have to
tell me anything...

448
00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:43,000
if you don't want to.

449
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:56,440
I have something

450
00:32:58,360 --> 00:32:59,760
from your sister.

451
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:11,320
She misses you.

452
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:31,480
Look at my belly.

453
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:52,880
There must be something wrong
with us, to do what we did.

454
00:34:04,360 --> 00:34:07,160
We heard there was
$10,000 in that house.

455
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:11,920
Once we tied up everybody
and searched all over,

456
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:14,840
I knew the guy
that told us about it was...

457
00:34:14,875 --> 00:34:17,240
was wrong. There was...
there was no money.

458
00:34:19,640 --> 00:34:21,800
Dick wouldn't believe it

459
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:23,760
so he went tearing
through the house,

460
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:25,440
banging on the walls

461
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:27,080
looking for a safe.

462
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:34,760
When he was done, he...

463
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:38,640
said he was gonna go up to Nancy's
room and have his way with her.

464
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:41,520
I wouldn't allow it.

465
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:44,400
And I told him that.

466
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:47,280
So I sat with her.

467
00:34:48,680 --> 00:34:50,120
Dick came up and got me.

468
00:34:50,160 --> 00:34:54,480
We turned off the lights
and went down to the basement

469
00:34:54,520 --> 00:34:56,840
where Mr. Clutter
and the boy was.

470
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:02,160
He kept saying,
"no witnesses," but I...

471
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:05,960
I figured
if I waited him out, he'd...

472
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,880
he'd give up and we'd
leave them tied up there.

473
00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:12,680
And we'd drive all night.
They'd never find us.

474
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:18,000
We tied Mr. Clutter's wrists
to a pipe over his head.

475
00:35:18,040 --> 00:35:21,280
And he... he looked hurt,
so I cut him down.

476
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:25,160
I... I put a box out there
so he'd be more comfortable.

477
00:35:28,080 --> 00:35:32,400
He asked how his wife and daughter
was and I... I said they were fine,

478
00:35:32,435 --> 00:35:36,720
and they were getting ready for
sleep, and it wouldn't be long tili...

479
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:39,080
till morning
when they'd find him.

480
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:49,200
He was just looking at me.

481
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:52,080
Looking into my eyes.

482
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:56,800
Like he expected me
to kill him.

483
00:35:56,840 --> 00:36:00,680
Like he expected me to be the
kind of person who would kill him.

484
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:11,720
I was thinking, "this... this
nice man is scared of me. "

485
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:18,440
I was so ashamed.

486
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:27,600
I mean, I thought
he was a... a very nice...

487
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:31,400
gentle man.

488
00:36:33,320 --> 00:36:36,200
And I thought so right up
till I slit his throat.

489
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:44,400
I didn't know what I did
till I heard the sound.

490
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:38,520
Added up,

491
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:43,800
how much money did you get
from the clutters that night?

492
00:37:48,120 --> 00:37:50,040
Between $40 and $50.

493
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:50,365
I mean, the truth is,

494
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:52,040
I’m desperate
to be done with it.

495
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:57,360
I've spent 4 years of
my life on this book.

496
00:40:03,080 --> 00:40:05,520
They got a stay of executive
yesterday.

497
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:07,880
Another, yes.

498
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:14,600
Supreme court.

499
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:18,480
It's harrowing.

500
00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:25,640
Me, all I want to do is to write the
ending and there's no end in sight.

501
00:40:40,520 --> 00:40:42,000
No, thank you.

502
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:55,880
"Dear friend Truman,

503
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:58,800
"haven't heard from you
in such a long while.

504
00:40:58,840 --> 00:41:01,160
"Please help find new lawyer.

505
00:41:02,120 --> 00:41:04,040
"If not,
Dick will have to write

506
00:41:04,080 --> 00:41:05,960
"the supreme court brief
himself.

507
00:41:07,880 --> 00:41:09,765
"Our last appeal.

508
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:11,720
"What a pair of
wretched creatures.

509
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:13,640
"Please help.

510
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:17,040
Your amigo? Perry. "

511
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:21,360
Just put it with the others.

512
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:51,960
You know, at least for Nelle
you should...

513
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:55,360
you should try and pretend
you're having a good time tonight.

514
00:42:37,120 --> 00:42:39,040
I thought
I’d find you here.

515
00:42:40,440 --> 00:42:41,920
Oh, Nelle.

516
00:42:43,320 --> 00:42:44,240
Nelle.

517
00:42:44,280 --> 00:42:45,760
Thank you.

518
00:42:46,200 --> 00:42:48,120
I'll have another,
please.

519
00:42:51,040 --> 00:42:52,240
How are you?

520
00:42:52,280 --> 00:42:53,440
Terrible.

521
00:42:54,880 --> 00:42:56,760
I'm sorry to hear that.

522
00:42:56,800 --> 00:43:00,120
I mean,
it's torture the way...

523
00:43:01,080 --> 00:43:03,000
what they're doing to me.

524
00:43:07,800 --> 00:43:10,240
And now
it's the supreme court.

525
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:13,120
And can you believe it?

526
00:43:15,040 --> 00:43:17,440
If they win this appeal,

527
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:19,800
I wili...

528
00:43:20,760 --> 00:43:23,200
have a complete
nervous breakdown.

529
00:43:25,120 --> 00:43:27,960
I may never recover,

530
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:31,840
and I’ll just pray
that it turns my way.

531
00:43:34,720 --> 00:43:36,400
It must be difficult.

532
00:43:36,440 --> 00:43:38,080
Oh, it's torture.

533
00:43:39,480 --> 00:43:41,400
They're torturing me.

534
00:43:42,360 --> 00:43:43,840
I see.

535
00:43:48,120 --> 00:43:50,560
And how'd you like the movie,
Truman?

536
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:07,840
Yeah...

537
00:44:12,160 --> 00:44:16,480
I frankly don't see
what all the fuss is about.

538
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:32,360
Hello.

539
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:33,840
Mr. Truman Capote?

540
00:44:33,880 --> 00:44:34,760
Yeah.

541
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:36,960
I have a call
from Mr. Perry Smith

542
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:39,080
in the Kansas
correctional system.

543
00:44:39,120 --> 00:44:41,040
Will you accept charges?

544
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:42,920
Yes.

545
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:44,880
Mr. Smith,
you're on the line.

546
00:44:45,360 --> 00:44:46,320
Hello.

547
00:44:48,240 --> 00:44:49,160
Hello?

548
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:51,080
Hello, Perry.

549
00:44:51,120 --> 00:44:54,480
They let me make a couple of phone
calls before I go down to holding.

550
00:44:54,520 --> 00:44:57,800
Y- y-you heard the supreme
court rejected the appeal?

551
00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:03,600
No, I... I didn't.
I hadn't heard that.

552
00:45:06,960 --> 00:45:08,400
Yeah.

553
00:45:11,280 --> 00:45:12,720
I'm sorry.

554
00:45:16,080 --> 00:45:18,480
Yeah. They let me make
2 phone calls.

555
00:45:21,360 --> 00:45:24,720
We got a date set for the
warehouse, Dick and me.

556
00:45:26,160 --> 00:45:29,040
2 weeks and finito.

557
00:45:29,520 --> 00:45:30,960
April 14.

558
00:45:34,280 --> 00:45:36,200
Will you visit me?

559
00:45:37,200 --> 00:45:38,640
Truman?

560
00:46:05,040 --> 00:46:06,960
It's... it's him again.

561
00:46:13,640 --> 00:46:16,560
It is utterly inappropriate
for me to talk to him.

562
00:46:25,680 --> 00:46:26,640
Yes?

563
00:46:31,400 --> 00:46:33,840
I'm sorry,
he won't be able to make it.

564
00:46:46,160 --> 00:46:47,080
Hello?

565
00:46:47,120 --> 00:46:49,000
Mr. Shawn, it's Nelle.

566
00:46:49,040 --> 00:46:50,960
I just got this telegram.
Has he seen it?

567
00:46:51,920 --> 00:46:53,800
He won't read it.

568
00:46:53,840 --> 00:46:55,280
Would you put him on,
please?

569
00:46:55,320 --> 00:46:57,160
Nelle, he won't talk.

570
00:46:57,200 --> 00:47:01,520
Mr. Shawn, if you have to hold him
down and put the phone on his ear,

571
00:47:01,555 --> 00:47:03,440
I need to speak to him.

572
00:47:04,880 --> 00:47:05,840
All right.

573
00:47:22,160 --> 00:47:23,600
Um,

574
00:47:25,520 --> 00:47:26,480
um,

575
00:47:27,440 --> 00:47:28,880
it's Nelle.

576
00:47:35,600 --> 00:47:37,000
Truman.

577
00:47:38,440 --> 00:47:41,760
"Miss Nelle Harper Lee
and Truman Capote.

578
00:47:43,680 --> 00:47:47,520
"Sorry that Truman was unable
to make it here to the prison

579
00:47:47,560 --> 00:47:50,800
"for a brief word
prior to necktie party.

580
00:47:51,280 --> 00:47:54,120
"Whatever his reason
for not showin' up,

581
00:47:54,160 --> 00:47:57,520
"I want him to know that I
cannot condemn him for it.

582
00:48:00,360 --> 00:48:02,760
"Not much time left,

583
00:48:02,800 --> 00:48:06,160
"but want you both to know that
I’ve been sincerely grateful

584
00:48:06,640 --> 00:48:09,040
"for your friendship
through the years

585
00:48:09,075 --> 00:48:11,880
"and everything else.

586
00:48:11,920 --> 00:48:15,240
"I'm not very good
at these things.

587
00:48:15,280 --> 00:48:18,640
"I have become extremely
affectionate toward you both.

588
00:48:19,600 --> 00:48:21,960
"But, harness time.

589
00:48:23,440 --> 00:48:26,800
Adios, amigos.
Your friend, Perry. "

590
00:48:38,720 --> 00:48:41,560
Well, I didn't expect
to see you again.

591
00:48:42,520 --> 00:48:44,960
You can visit
for a few minutes.

592
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:50,240
Yeah.
No.

593
00:48:56,480 --> 00:48:57,920
5 minutes.

594
00:49:01,240 --> 00:49:02,200
Well, well.

595
00:49:04,120 --> 00:49:05,600
He returns.

596
00:49:07,040 --> 00:49:09,440
I don't know
what you must think of me.

597
00:49:11,360 --> 00:49:14,720
Well, you haven't been
foremost on my mind lately,

598
00:49:14,760 --> 00:49:16,640
as you can probably imagine.

599
00:49:20,480 --> 00:49:21,880
You got the letter?

600
00:49:24,320 --> 00:49:25,280
Yes, I did.

601
00:49:29,120 --> 00:49:31,000
It's true.

602
00:49:31,040 --> 00:49:32,960
I understand why you
didn't want to come.

603
00:49:34,400 --> 00:49:37,280
I wouldn't be here either
if I didn't have to.

604
00:49:37,320 --> 00:49:38,680
You got that right.

605
00:49:43,040 --> 00:49:47,320
You know Ricardo donated
his eyes to science?

606
00:49:47,360 --> 00:49:51,680
Next week, some blind man will
be seeing what Dick used to see.

607
00:49:52,160 --> 00:49:54,560
Yeah, you could be walking in
Denver or somewhere, Truman,

608
00:49:55,040 --> 00:49:58,360
and suddenly these eyes
will be staring at you.

609
00:49:58,400 --> 00:50:00,800
That would be something,
wouldn't it?

610
00:50:01,760 --> 00:50:04,640
It would be. It would be.

611
00:50:18,040 --> 00:50:19,960
You'll be watching?

612
00:50:21,440 --> 00:50:22,880
I don't know, I’ll be...

613
00:50:25,280 --> 00:50:26,720
do you want me to?

614
00:50:31,520 --> 00:50:33,440
I'd like to have
a friend there.

615
00:50:34,400 --> 00:50:36,760
Ok. Then I will.

616
00:50:47,360 --> 00:50:48,800
It's all right.

617
00:51:07,040 --> 00:51:08,960
I did everything I could.

618
00:51:09,920 --> 00:51:10,880
It's ok.

619
00:51:20,760 --> 00:51:22,240
I truly did.

620
00:51:23,640 --> 00:51:25,040
I know.

621
00:51:33,680 --> 00:51:34,640
It's time.

622
00:51:44,720 --> 00:51:46,120
Mr. Capote.

623
00:52:01,520 --> 00:52:02,885
Goodbye.

624
00:52:02,920 --> 00:52:05,765
You're not rid of us yet.

625
00:52:05,800 --> 00:52:07,520
We'll see you
in a few minutes.

626
00:52:07,560 --> 00:52:09,200
I wish I had...
Mr. Capote.

627
00:52:10,160 --> 00:52:12,080
Mr. Capote.
Goodbye.

628
00:53:05,320 --> 00:53:06,720
Nice to see you.

629
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:49,885
Perry Edward Smith.

630
00:53:49,920 --> 00:53:51,840
For the crime of murder
in the first degree,

631
00:53:51,880 --> 00:53:53,320
by order of the cour
t of Finney county

632
00:53:53,800 --> 00:53:55,720
and the supreme court of the
sovereign state of Kansas,

633
00:53:55,755 --> 00:53:57,160
you are sentenced
to hang until you die.

634
00:53:57,640 --> 00:54:00,240
"I will fear no evil:
For thou art with me.

635
00:54:00,280 --> 00:54:02,880
Thy rod and thy staff,
they comfort me. "

636
00:54:02,920 --> 00:54:04,800
You can say something
if you want.

637
00:54:10,120 --> 00:54:12,480
Is there anybody
from the family here?

638
00:54:13,480 --> 00:54:14,440
No, Perry.

639
00:54:19,240 --> 00:54:20,640
Well, tell them...

640
00:54:26,400 --> 00:54:30,760
I can't remember what I was
gonna say for the life of me.

641
00:54:48,520 --> 00:54:51,400
Our father who art in heaven,
hallowed be thy name.

642
00:54:51,880 --> 00:54:53,280
Thy kingdom come.

643
00:54:53,320 --> 00:54:56,200
Thy will be done,
on earth as it is in heaven.

644
00:54:56,235 --> 00:54:58,560
Give us this day
our daily bread.

645
00:54:58,600 --> 00:55:02,400
...as we forgive those
who trespass against us.

646
00:55:02,440 --> 00:55:05,760
And lead us not into temptation,
but deliver us from evil.

647
00:55:34,120 --> 00:55:36,480
It was a terrible experience

648
00:55:39,360 --> 00:55:41,800
and I will never get over it.

649
00:55:43,720 --> 00:55:47,040
They're dead, Truman.
You're alive.

650
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:52,360
And there wasn't anything I
could have done to save them.

651
00:55:55,200 --> 00:55:56,680
Maybe not,

652
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:02,440
but, the fact is,
you didn't want to.
