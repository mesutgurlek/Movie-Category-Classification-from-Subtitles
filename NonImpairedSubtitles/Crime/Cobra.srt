What?

642
01:21:04,234 --> 01:21:05,651
Gummy Bears.

643
01:21:06,152 --> 01:21:07,236
Gummy Bears?

644
01:21:10,240 --> 01:21:11,448
See you at the hospital.

COBRA: Don't drive too fast.

Easy.

All right, you guys, clean it all up.

648
01:21:22,252 --> 01:21:23,377
HALLIWELL:
Cobra.

649
01:21:23,753 --> 01:21:25,629
You did a hell of a job here.

650
01:21:26,256 --> 01:21:29,383
You ever want a transfer
to something easier...

651
01:21:29,634 --> 01:21:30,968
. ..or you need anything...

652
01:21:31,177 --> 01:21:32,678
. ..just say the word.

653
01:21:33,597 --> 01:21:34,930
Well. . . .

654
01:21:35,140 --> 01:21:37,808
I would like to have my car replaced.

655
01:21:38,643 --> 01:21:41,604
We'd like to,
but it's not in the budget.

656
01:21:42,647 --> 01:21:43,647
Well. . . .

657
01:21:43,815 --> 01:21:47,526
See you back at headquarters.
I'll take care of your toy for you.

No hard feelings.

660
01:21:56,161 --> 01:21:58,412
You kind of overdid it around here.

661
01:21:58,830 --> 01:22:00,497
I personally would have looked for...

662
01:22:00,707 --> 01:22:03,918
. ..a more subtle solution,
but that's not your style.

663
01:22:04,502 --> 01:22:06,170
No hard feelings.

No hard feelings, pal.

CHO:
Cobra?

667
01:22:28,735 --> 01:22:29,944
I'll give you a lift.

668
01:22:30,195 --> 01:22:32,571
No, I've got my own
transportation, thanks.

669

You ready?

670
01:22:34,532 --> 01:22:36,450
Ready, Marion.

671
01:22:37,535 --> 01:22:39,244
Catchy name, isn't it?
