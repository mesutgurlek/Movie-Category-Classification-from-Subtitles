I'M OFFICER SOLIS,
LAPD, HOLLYWOOD DIVISION.

8
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:45,100
WE RESPONDED HERE
TO A POSSIBLE 187,

9
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:47,600
DID A VISUAL CHECK OF THE HOUSE,

10
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:50,300
SAW WHAT WE THOUGHT WAS A BODY
ON THE DOWNSTAIRS FLOOR.

11
00:00:51,700 --> 00:00:54,700
FINDING ALL DOORS AND WINDOWS
LOCKED FROM THE INSIDE,

12
00:00:54,700 --> 00:00:55,900
WE WAITED FOR BACKUP.

13
00:00:55,900 --> 00:00:58,200
THEN WE DID A HOT-CRISIS ENTRY.

14
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:01,800
GREAT. AND NOW SHE WANTS
THE NUMBER OF THE 911 CALLER.

00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:11,800
WE ARRIVED ON THE SCENE,
CALLED OUT FOR THE CORONER,

19
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:13,400
AND OBTAINED A SEARCH WARRANT.

20
00:01:13,900 --> 00:01:17,900
SO FAR WE'VE FOUND ALMOST $800
IN CASH AND LOTS OF JEWELRY,

21
00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:20,400
SO ALTHOUGH WE CANNOT
RULE OUT A ROBBERY,

22
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:24,600
WE ARE YET TO DETERMINE
WHAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN STOLEN.

23
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:31,900
OVER HERE,
WE HAVE VICTIM NUMBER ONE.

24

OVER HERE, WHAT COULD BE
A BLOOD TRAIL,

38
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:15,300
WHERE MRS. WALLACE POSSIBLY

39
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:18,500

52
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:58,300

LIEUTENANT ANDREW FLYNN, PhD.

WE'RE ASSUMING THIS VICTIM,
JENNIFER ANNE WALLACE,

57
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:17,700
WHO, UM...
SIGNS HER HOMEWORK "JENNY" --

58
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:20,300
AND JUST, UH...

59
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:24,000
JUST, UH -- YOU KNOW WHAT?
WAIT.

60
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,600
JUST WAIT.
LIEUTENANT FLYNN,

61
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:29,800
ARE YOU?
I MEAN, LOOK AT THIS. LOOK.

62
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:33,500
ALL THIS CAME
FROM THIS LITTLE GIRL'S HEART,

63
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:35,200
AND I CAN'T SAY
THAT IT'S BLOOD?

64
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:36,800
JUST ONE SECOND, OKAY?

65
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:38,900
SERGEANT GABRIEL,
I KNOW I ASKED YOU THIS BEFORE,

66
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:41,200
BUT COULD YOU PLEASE
FIND THE PATROL OFFICER

67
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:42,600
AND GET THE PHONE NUMBER

68
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:44,800
OF WHOEVER
REPORTED THESE DEATHS TO 911

69
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:47,400
AND START CALLING IT, PLEASE,
TO SEE IF ANYONE ANSWERS?

70
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:48,100
THANK YOU.

71
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:50,600
UH, ONE
IN MRS. WALLACE'S PURSE

72
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:53,800
AND ONE OFF AND CHARGING
BEHIND THE WET BAR IN THE DEN.

73
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,600
YOU WANT ME TO LOOK
IN THE LITTLE GIRL'S ROOM?

74
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:00,100
YES, PLEASE. THANK YOU.

75
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:01,400
HANK YOU.

76
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:05,900
LOOK, LIEUTENANT,
I KNOW THAT THIS IS HARD,

77
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:08,400
BUT WE ARE FILMING
THIS CRIME SCENE FOR THE COURT.

78
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:10,900
IF YOU CALL ONE LITTLE SPOT
"BLOOD" THAT ISN'T BLOOD --

79
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:13,300
AND I CAN'T EDIT THIS,
SO...

80
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:18,000
OKAY.

81
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:21,200
THE VICTIM IS 12
AND IN HER PAJAMAS.

82
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:24,800
SO MAYBE SHE CAME DOWNSTAIRS

83
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:26,900
TO SEE WHAT
ALL THE SCREAMING WAS ABOUT.

84
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:30,000
THERE ARE THREE
VISIBLE WOUNDS --

85
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,300
ONE IN THE BACK,
ONE IN THE CHEST,

86
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:33,400
AND ONE IN THE THROAT.

87
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:35,000
WOULD YOU DOCUMENT THAT,
PLEASE?

88
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:35,900
YES, MA'AM.

89
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,900
THERE'S A LETTER OPENER
HERE IN THE SINK.

90
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:48,900
NOW, THIS MIGHT BE
FROM THE BLOTTER SET

91
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:50,500
ON THE DESK DOWNSTAIRS.

92
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:51,600
NOW, OVER HERE --

93
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,900
YOU HAVE TO IDENTIFY YOURSELF
FOR THE COURT.

94
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:55,500
OH, FOR CRYING OUT --

95
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:57,900
LIEUTENANT PROVENZA,
PRIORITY HOMICIDE.

96
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,600
NOW, RECORD ALL THIS HERE, TOO.

97
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,500
YOU CAN SEE WHAT MIGHT BE BLOOD
ALL OVER THE FLOOR.

98
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:08,400
WE THINK THAT WHOEVER
KILLED THE WALLACES

99
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:11,400
CAME UP HERE
AND TOOK A SHOWER AFTER.

100
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:17,100
HELLO, THERE.

101
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:18,800
I'M LIEUTENANT MICHAEL TAO,

102
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:22,300
PRIORITY HOMICIDE DIVISION
OF THE LOS ANGELES POLICE.

103
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:23,700
NOW, IF YOU'LL COME WITH ME.

104
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,500
I FOUND THESE CLOTHES
IN THE WASHER.

105
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:33,900
THEY HAVE A RED SUBSTANCE
ON THEM, PERHAPS BLOOD.

106
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:36,500
UM, THIS WAY.

107
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:44,300
IT'S ALSO WORTH NOTING THAT
THE VICTIMS' 17-YEAR-OLD SON,

108
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:48,600
ERIC DEAN WALLACE,
IS NOT HOME AT 4:33 A.M.

109
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:50,400
AND HIS ROOM
HAS NOT BEEN TOUCHED,

110
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:54,100
DESPITE HAVING A LOT OF HIGH-END
MERCHANDISE LYING AROUND.

111
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:57,200
OH, AND THE SHOES FROM
THE WASHER ARE THE SAME SIZE

112
00:05:57,200 --> 00:06:00,300
AS THE SHOES ON THIS FLOOR,
RIGHT HERE.

113
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:10,000
BUZZ, DOWNSTAIRS. OUT.

114
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:22,000
Backup. Now.

115
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:32,800
Man: GET DOWN
ON YOUR STOMACH!

116
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:36,300
Man: DON'T MOVE, GUYS.
BACK. BACK. BACK.

117
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,400
PLEASE. PLEASE. PLEASE.

118
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:41,900
PLEASE.

119
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:44,600
GET UP.

120
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:47,000
WHAT'S YOUR NAME?

121
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:50,000
I'M ERIC DEAN WALLACE.

122
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:53,000
I WANT TO
SEE MY MOM AND DAD.

123
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:56,200
I WANT TO SEE THEM,
PLEASE.

124
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:57,300
I UNDERSTAND THAT, HONEY.

125
00:06:57,300 --> 00:07:00,200
THAT'S JUST NOT
A GOOD IDEA RIGHT NOW, OKAY?

126
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:02,400
CAN YOU TELL ME
WHEN ALL THIS HAPPENED?

127
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:06,500
I WOKE UP, AND I WAS GOING
DOWNSTAIRS

128
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:07,800
TO GET A DRINK OF WATER.

129
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:10,600
AND...
I GOT TO THE STAIRS.

130
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:11,700
MM-HMM?

131
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:16,500
JENNY --
SHE WAS JUST LYING THERE.

132
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:19,700
WAS THERE ANYONE VISITING
YOUR HOUSE THIS EVENING?

133
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:21,500
NO.

134
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:24,500
DID YOU HEAR A DOORBELL
OR A KNOCK OR --

135
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:25,200
NO.

136
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:29,800
DO YOU KNOW ANYONE WHO MIGHT
WANT TO HURT YOUR FAMILY?

137
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:32,500
MY DAD WORKS
WITH SOME CONVICTS.

138
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:33,400
MM-HMM?

139
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:35,800
HE WORKS FOR THE FEDERAL PRISON
UP TERMINAL ISLAND

140
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:38,800
AND THE ONE
UP AT LOMPOC, TOO.

141
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:42,000
HE'S --
HE'S A SOCIOLOGIST.

142
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:43,300
OKAY.

143
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:46,900
OKAY, SWEETHEART.

144
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:49,900
OKAY, NOW.

145
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:52,800
ALL RIGHT, THEN.

146
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:55,400
THEY'RE GONNA TREAT YOU
FOR SHOCK, OKAY?

147
00:07:56,700 --> 00:07:58,600
THEY'RE GONNA TAKE
GOOD CARE OF YOU, OKAY?

148
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:01,500
ALL RIGHT.
BLESS YOUR HEART.

149
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:03,200
OKAY.

150
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,100
SERGEANT GABRIEL HERE
IS GONNA RIDE WITH YOU TO THE HOSPITAL.

151
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:09,100
I'LL GO WITH HIM,
CHIEF.

152
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:10,800
NO, YOU WON'T,
LIEUTENANT.

153
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,600
ALL RIGHT,
DETECTIVE SANCHEZ,

154
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:18,200
THAT BOY HAD PUPILS
THE SIZE OF SAUCERS.

155
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:21,000
I'D LIKE YOU TO GET A WARRANT
SO WE CAN CHECK HIS BLOOD

156
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,500
FOR DRUGS WHEN HE GETS
TO THE HOSPITAL, PLEASE.

157
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:28,000
AND, LIEUTENANT FLYNN, SINCE YOU
SEEM TO BE IN THE MOOD,

158
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,500
I'D LIKE YOU
TO GET THE PATROL OFFICERS

159
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:31,100
WHO SAID
THIS HOUSE WAS CLEARED.

160
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:33,000
GIVE THEM A PIECE
OF MY MIND, OKAY?

161
00:08:33,100 --> 00:08:33,700
YOU GOT IT.

162
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:34,800
THANK YOU.

163
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:37,000
LIEUTENANT PROVENZA...

164
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:41,900
UM...PLEASE SUPERVISE
THE SEARCH WARRANT.

165
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:43,700
THE KILLER
WAS LOOKING FOR SOMETHING.

166
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:44,900
MAYBE HE DIDN'T FIND IT.

167
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:47,100
THANK YOU.

168
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:53,200
HEY, DON'T FORGET
YOU HAVE A MEETING

169
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:55,000
WITH CHIEF POPE
AT 10:00 A.M.

170
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:56,600
OH, FOR HEAVEN SAKES.

171
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:58,400
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA
WHAT THAT'S ALL ABOUT?

172
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:03,400
SHOOT!

173
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:06,700
Pope:
AND NO MORE OVERTIME.

174
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:09,400
HOW CAN THERE BE
NO OVERTIME?

175
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:10,900
WHAT IF MY VICTIMS
DON'T DIE

176
00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:12,700
BETWEEN 8:00 AND 4:00
IN THE AFTERNOON?

177
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:14,900
LOOK, IT'S JUST
A LITTLE APPROVAL PROCESS

178
00:09:14,900 --> 00:09:17,600
WE'RE IMPLEMENTING DURING
THIS TIME OF FINANCIAL CRISIS,

179
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:20,800
WHICH WAS CREATED BY THE STATE
OF CALIFORNIA, NOT BY ME.

180
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:23,400
IS THAT WHY MY REQUEST FOR
EXPEDITED BLOOD WORK WAS DENIED?

181
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:24,400
WHAT BLOOD WORK?

182
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:27,300
I HAVE A BOY IN THE HOSPITAL,
ERIC WALLACE,

183
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:28,600
AND EARLY THIS MORNING,

184
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:31,200
HIS ENTIRE FAMILY WAS FOUND
STABBED TO DEATH IN THEIR HOUSE,

185
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:33,400
AND THE BOY, UP IN THE ATTIC,
HIGH AS A KITE.

186
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:35,800
SO YOU OBTAIN A SEARCH WARRANT
AND DRAW THE BOY'S BLOOD.

187
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:37,100
WE DID THAT, WILL.

188
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:41,200
AND NOW DETECTIVE SANCHEZ
TELLS ME --

189
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:43,700
BECAUSE IT WOULD COST
AN EXTRA DOLLAR OR SOMETHING --

190
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:46,900
THAT MY REQUEST TO TEST
THE BOY'S BLOOD FOR INTOXICANTS WAS DENIED.

191
00:09:46,900 --> 00:09:48,500
IT'S NOT DENIED.
IT'S DELAYED.

192
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:50,000
YOU'LL HAVE
THE RESULTS TOMORROW MORNING.

193
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,400
TOMORROW, THAT BOY CAN HAVE
AN ATTORNEY APPOINTED FOR HIM

194
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:53,500
BY CHILDREN'S SERVICES.

195
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:55,900
I NEED THAT BLOOD WORK,
AND I NEED IT RIGHT NOW.

196
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:58,200
CONSIDER JUST FOR A MOMENT

197
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:02,300
A UNIVERSE
IN WHICH <i>YOU</i> WORK FOR <i>ME</i>

198
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:05,000
AND WHAT I NEED
IS IMPORTANT, TOO.

199
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
I'LL DO THAT
AFTER YOU CONSIDER

200
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,900
GETTING OUT OF BED
AT 3:00 IN THE MORNING

201
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:11,000
AND EXAMINING
A 12-YEAR-OLD GIRL

202
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,400
WHO'S BEEN
STABBED THROUGH THE HEART.

203
00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:16,000
WHAT ABOUT HER NEEDS, WILL?
WHAT ABOUT THAT?

204
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:19,300
LOOK, I KNOW THIS IS HARD,

205
00:10:19,300 --> 00:10:21,800
BUT SO IS LOSING 6%
OF OUR BUDGET

206
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:25,500
AND SIMULTANEOUSLY BEEFING UP
OUR COUNTERTERRORISM BUREAU.

207
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,900
IT'S NOT JUST, UH,
HALTING EXPEDITED BLOOD WORK.

208
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:33,700
EVERY SECTION HAS TO LOSE
AT LEAST ONE DETECTIVE.

209
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:35,600
YOU DON'T MEAN MINE.

210
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:38,600
YES, I DO MEAN YOURS, BRENDA.
EVERY SECTION.

211
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:39,900
WHO WOULD I LET GO?

212
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:42,400
COME ON.
YOU KNOW AS WELL AS I DO.

213
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:43,900
NO.

214
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:47,300
SIX MONTHS AGO, PROVENZA
LEFT HIS GUN IN HIS DESK DRAWER.

215
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:50,000
LIEUTENANT PROVENZA
WAS CLEARED OF ALL --

216
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
NO, HE WAS NOT CLEARED.

217
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,800
HEY, WE HAVE ALL
LEFT OUR GUNS.

218
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:54,300
YOURS IS IN YOUR DRAWER
RIGHT NOW.

219
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:04,000
OKAY?

220
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:05,200
MM-HMM.

221
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:08,200
LISTEN, I CAN'T
FIND THE SAVINGS I NEED,

222
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:11,200
EXCEPT BY LOSING
AND/OR TRANSFERRING PERSONNEL.

223
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:14,600
YOU MUST -- <i>MUST --</i>
SEND SOMEONE FROM YOUR TEAM

224
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:17,700
TO COUNTERTERRORISM
OR TALK PROVENZA INTO RETIRING.

225
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,800
WHICH IS THE BETTER SOLUTION?
IT'S OBVIOUS.

226
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:21,700
WHAT DO I HAVE TO DO
TO MAKE YOU AGREE WITH ME?

227
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:23,000
STOP BEING WRONG.

228
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:26,300
LOOK, I'LL PAY FOR
THE EXPEDITED BLOOD WORK MYSELF,

229
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:28,400
BUT MY TEAM STAYS PUT.

230
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:30,600
NO, BRENDA, NO DEAL.

231
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:32,700
I'LL FIND THE SAVINGS
SOME OTHER WAY.

232
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:33,800
YEAH,
GOOD LUCK WITH THAT.

233
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:34,800
THANK YOU.

234
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:43,400
THE ONLY OTHER THING
I FOUND AT THE HOUSE,

235
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:46,000
OTHER THAN
ERIC'S DRUG STASH HERE,

236
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:48,300
WAS THAT THE GARAGE DOOR
WAS OPEN

237
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:52,500
AND THE WALLACES' VEHICLE
HAD BEEN BROKEN INTO.

238
00:11:54,900 --> 00:11:57,000
UH...OKAY.

239
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,100
SO, THE KILLER WAS LOOKING
FOR SOMETHING SPECIFIC.

240
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:02,500
IT MAY HAVE BELONGED
TO MR. WALLACE,

241
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:04,700
BUT WE DON'T
KNOW WHAT IT WAS.

242
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:08,500
UM, LIEUTENANT TAO,

243
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:10,200
HOW ARE WE DOING
WITH OUR MURDER WEAPON?

244
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:11,800
Tao: OH, UM...

245
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:15,500
WIPED CLEAN.
NO PRINTS.

246
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:19,000
PRELIMINARY TIME OF DEATH
FOR ALL VICTIMS

247
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,100
BETWEEN 11:00 AND 12:45.

248
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:24,100
AND I SENT THE BLOODY CLOTHES
FROM THE WASHING MACHINE

249
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:25,400
TO THE LAB FOR TESTING.

250
00:12:25,700 --> 00:12:28,000
DETECTIVE DANIELS,
CELLPHONES, LAPTOPS?

251
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:29,400
ALL ACCOUNTED FOR.

252
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:31,100
OKAY. LIEUTENANT FLYNN?

253
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:34,700
YOU REALLY WANT BACKGROUND
ON THIS FAMILY? WHY?

254
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:36,900
THE WEAPON CAME
FROM INSIDE.

255
00:12:36,900 --> 00:12:39,700
EVERY DOOR WAS BOLTED.
EVERY WINDOW WAS LOCKED.

256
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:42,400
OKAY, SO MAYBE THE MURDERS
WEREN'T PREMEDITATED.

257
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:45,900
BUT THE SON DID IT.
WE ALL KNOW THAT THE SON DID IT.

258
00:12:45,900 --> 00:12:47,900
Daniels: AND ERIC
LIED ABOUT HIS FATHER, TOO.

259
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:49,600
WALLACE DIDN'T WORK
AT EITHER

260
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:52,400
THE FEDERAL PRISON ON TERMINAL
ISLAND, NOR UP IN LOMPOC.

261
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:54,700
WHY WOULD ERIC LIE
ABOUT WHERE HIS FATHER WORKED?

262
00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:56,000
THE KID WAS ON "X."

263
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,800
OH, AND YOU OWE ME $150
FOR THIS EXPEDITED BLOOD WORK.

264
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:01,800
ERIC IS SEDATED.

265
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:07,100
BUT THIS, UH,
BITCH-Y E.R. NURSE

266
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:09,900
GOT ALL WHACKED OUT
OVER ERIC MAYBE BEING A KILLER

267
00:13:09,900 --> 00:13:12,300
AND HOW THE HOSPITAL
IS NOT A DETENTION CENTER.

268
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:15,100
SO NOW THEY WON'T HOLD HIM
AFTER HE COMES TO.

269
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:18,300
I MEAN,
YOU GOT MAYBE FIVE HOURS.

270
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:20,400
THIS IS YOUR RECEIPT.

271
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:23,100
Brenda:
OKAY, FIVE HOURS.

272
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:27,700
UM, OKAY,
UM...LIEUTENANT TAO,

273
00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:30,100
IF YOU COULD
PLEASE GET PHONE DUMPS

274
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:32,700
FOR THE WALLACES' CELLPHONES
AND LANDLINES.

275
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:33,600
THANK YOU.

276
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
AND, LIEUTENANT FLYNN,
IF YOU COULD

277
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,600
TAKE OUR MURDER WEAPON
OVER TO THE MORGUE

278
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:40,400
AND HAVE DR. CRIPPEN MATCH IT
AGAINST THE WOUNDS.

279
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:43,400
DETECTIVE DANIELS, FOLLOW UP
ON THAT TERMINAL ISLAND

280
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:44,700
AND LOMPOC CONNECTION,
PLEASE.

281
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:45,900
IF MR. WALLACE
DIDN'T WORK THERE,

282
00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:48,300
HE MIGHT BE ON
THE PRISONS' VISITORS LISTS.

283
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:53,900
OKAY, LIEUTENANT PROVENZA,
IF YOU COULD PLEASE

284
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:55,700
GATHER EVERYONE'S REPORTS

285
00:13:55,700 --> 00:13:58,400
AND BRING THEM OVER TO ME
AT THE HOSPITAL.

286
00:13:58,500 --> 00:13:59,500
THANK YOU.

287
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:04,300
OH, AND, UH,
SINCE IT'S SATURDAY,

288
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:09,300
UM, IF Y'ALL COULD SIGN OUT
WHEN YOU LEAVE,

289
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:11,200
UM, STARTING
WITH DETECTIVE SANCHEZ,

290
00:14:11,900 --> 00:14:14,300
'CAUSE WE HAVE TO PINCH
THOSE PENNIES WHERE WE CAN.

291
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:17,000
THANK YOU. THANKS.

292
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:21,300
WHAT IN THE HELL
IS WRONG WITH YOU?

293
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:24,500
DO YOU NOT
UNDERSTAND BUDGET CUTS?

294
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:25,900
WHAT BUDGET CUTS?

295
00:14:25,900 --> 00:14:27,300
THE MEMO'S ON YOUR DESK.

296
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:29,600
EVERY DEPARTMENT'S
LOSING A DETECTIVE.

297
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:32,600
AND FLYNN'S ACTING LIKE
HE WANTS TO BE THE SHORT STRAW.

298
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:36,600
I'M NOT THE ONE ELIGIBLE
FOR RETIREMENT HERE.

299
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:46,100
WELL, LET'S --
LET'S GET ON WITH IT.

300
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:48,800
TIME IS MONEY, FOLKS.

301
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:53,400
TIME IS MONEY.

302
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:09,900
Fritz: HEY.

303
00:15:10,900 --> 00:15:12,500
ARE YOU COMING TO LOOK
AT THESE OPEN HOUSES...

304
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:13,700
Shh!

305
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:15,500
...OR NOT?

306
00:15:15,900 --> 00:15:18,000
I KNOW THAT THE PRISONS
ARE FEDERAL PROPERTY,

307
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:18,900
BUT THEY SHOULD AT LEAST

308
00:15:18,900 --> 00:15:20,900
LET US LOOK
AT THEIR VISITORS LISTS.

309
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:23,800
UH, WELL,
ALL RIGHT, DETECTIVE,

310
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:26,600
MAYBE I CAN GET THE FBI TO HURRY
THOSE LISTS ALONG FOR US.

311
00:15:27,900 --> 00:15:29,000
ALL RIGHT, THEN.

312
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:30,700
THANK YOU. BYE.

313
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:37,600
SO, I HAVE
THIS MURDER SUSPECT...

314
00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:42,000
...TELLING ME
THAT HIS FATHER

315
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,300
WORKS
AT THE FEDERAL PRISONS

316
00:15:44,300 --> 00:15:47,000
AT TERMINAL ISLAND
AND UP AT LOMPOC.

317
00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:50,200
BUT BOTH PRISONS SAY THEY NEVER
HEARD OF THE FATHER AT ALL.

318
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:51,900
LOOKS BAD FOR THE SON.

319
00:15:51,900 --> 00:15:55,300
AND IN ORDER TO EXAMINE
THE PRISONS' VISITORS LISTS,

320
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,300
WE HAVE TO PUT TOGETHER
INDIVIDUAL WARRANTS.

321
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:02,700
HOWEVER, IF A VERY SPECIAL
AGENT OF THE FBI

322
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:04,300
WERE TO CALL AND ASK --

323
00:16:04,300 --> 00:16:05,300
NO PROBLEM.

324
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:07,800
ALL YOU HAVE TO DO

325
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:13,000
IS FILL OUT THESE FORMS
REQUESTING OUR ASSISTANCE,

326
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:15,400
AND I CAN HAND IT IN
TO OUR OFFICE ON MONDAY.

327
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:16,900
COULDN'T
YOU JUST CALL AND --

328
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:19,900
(DESK)

329
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:23,000
THAT WAS ON MY DESK
ALL DAY FRIDAY.

330
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:29,000
YEAH, PEOPLE KEPT STOPPING BY,
BURSTING OUT LAUGHING.

331
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,300
ISN'T THAT HILARIOUS?

332
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:35,500
THIS THING IS JUST --
IT'S AWFUL.

333
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:39,000
BUT WHAT HAPPENED
AT MY WORK TODAY?

334
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:42,600
POPE ANNOUNCED CUTBACKS,
INCLUDING, LIKE, IN PERSONNEL.

335
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:43,500
OH.

336
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:45,600
AND HE TOOK AWAY
OUR OVERTIME.

337
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:46,800
WELL, THAT'S NUTS.

338
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:48,500
WHAT IF PEOPLE
GET MURDERED AT NIGHT?

339
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:49,600
EXACTLY.

340
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:52,800
AND ALL THIS PAPERWORK,

341
00:16:53,700 --> 00:16:56,800
HONEY, IT WILL TAKE HOURS
TO FILL OUT.

342
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:57,900
YEAH, YOU'RE RIGHT.

343
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:02,000
SO, ARE YOU COMING
WITH ME TODAY OR NOT?

344
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:04,900
OH, I-I HAVE TO PUT THAT OFF
AT LEAST UNTIL TOMORROW,

345
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:05,900
BECAUSE --

346
00:17:07,100 --> 00:17:08,600
HEY! HEY!

347
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:09,600
WHAT A MINUTE.

348
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:12,200
YOU ARE BEING COMPLETELY
UNFAIR ABOUT THIS.

349
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:14,200
I HAVE A MURDER
TO INVESTIGATE.

350
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:15,700
YOU ALWAYS HAVE A MURDER.

351
00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:18,100
AND, YOU KNOW,
I LIKE THIS HOUSE.

352
00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:20,100
IT'S COMFORTABLE.
IT'S DONE.

353
00:17:20,100 --> 00:17:22,100
YOU ARE
ALWAYS RUSHING ME.

354
00:17:22,100 --> 00:17:23,900
HOW MANY TIMES DO I HAVE TO
WIN THIS ARGUMENT?

355
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:26,300
THERE IS NO PLACE
FOR MY STUFF HERE

356
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:27,300
OR TO SET UP AN OFFICE

357
00:17:27,300 --> 00:17:29,500
OR TO HAVE OVERNIGHT GUESTS,
LIKE OUR PARENTS.

358
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:31,300
WELL, WE CAN'T HAVE
MY FATHER COME HERE ANYWAY.

359
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:34,000
WE HAVEN'T FIGURED OUT A WAY
TO EXPLAIN THAT YOU'VE MOVED IN.

360
00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:36,300
YEAH, WELL, I HAVEN'T
MOVED IN, NOW, HAVE I?

361
00:17:37,100 --> 00:17:41,200
ALMOST EVERYTHING I OWN
IS STILL IN THE GARAGE!

362
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:46,200
NOW, DO YOU WANT THE VISITORS
LISTS TO THE PRISONS

363
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:48,400
AT LOMPOC AND TERMINAL ISLAND
OR NOT?

364
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:50,800
ARE YOU TELLING ME
THAT YOU'RE REFUSING TO HELP ME

365
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:52,000
WITH MY MURDER INVESTIGATION

366
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,700
BECAUSE I CAN'T GO
HOUSE HUNTING WITH YOU TODAY?

367
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:54,600
???

368
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:56,700
YEAH, GOOD. I DON'T HAVE TO
EXPLAIN IT TO YOU.

369
00:17:57,100 --> 00:18:00,600
WELL, I REFUSE TO STAND HERE
AND HAGGLE WITH YOU,

370
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:04,100
AS IF WE'RE TRADING TRINKETS
IN SOME BAZAAR.

371
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:05,400
GOOD. BYE.

372
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:08,100
IF I SEE SOMETHING I LIKE,
I'LL TAKE PICTURES.

373
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,100
Gabriel: BECAUSE MR. WALLACE
WAS AN ORPHAN.

374
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:19,500
HOW CAN PEOPLE BE ORPHANS?

375
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:21,800
SHE'S MAD BECAUSE
ERIC'S FATHER HAD NO PARENTS.

376
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:23,800
HIS MOTHER WAS AN ONLY CHILD,
PARENTS DECEASED,

377
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:26,100
SO WE HAVE NO RELATIVE
TO RELEASE THE KID TO.

378
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:27,600
[ COFFEE MACHINE BUZZES ]
OH!

379
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:30,100
CONSIDERING HOW THE KID
TREATS HIS NEXT OF KIN,

380
00:18:30,100 --> 00:18:31,200
IT'S PROBABLY BEST.

381
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:33,100
I HAVE SOME --
CHIEF, CHIEF, PLEASE.

382
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:35,000
PLEASE. HERE. LET ME.

383
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:40,700
ANYWAY, UNLESS ERIC
TURNS OUT TO BE SUICIDAL,

384
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:43,800
WHICH IS HIGHLY UNLIKELY
BASED UPON THE WAY HE JUST ATE,

385
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:45,500
THE HOSPITAL SAYS
WE EITHER HAVE TO ARREST HIM,

386
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:47,300
OR THEY'RE GONNA RELEASE HIM
TO CHILD PROTECTIVE SERVICES,

387
00:18:47,300 --> 00:18:49,000
WHICH TAKES HIM
OUT OF OUR CUSTODY.

388
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,900
I DON'T HAVE ENOUGH EVIDENCE YET
TO BOOK HIM FOR MURDER.

389
00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:52,800
WELL, WE HAVE HIM
ON DRUG POSSESSION.

390
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:54,900
NO. ARREST, LAWYER,
THE END.

391
00:18:58,100 --> 00:18:58,900
HMM.

392
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:03,200
SO I NEED A SUICIDE WATCH
OR A CONFESSION.

393
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:07,900
I KNOW MR. WALLACE
DIDN'T WORK IN PRISONS.

394
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:11,800
I CAN'T FIND ANYTHING HERE
ABOUT HOW HE MADE HIS INCOME.

395
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:13,400
NO, IT'S ALL SMALL AMOUNTS

396
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:15,400
FROM ARTICLES HE PUBLISHED
IN ACADEMIC JOURNALS.

397
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:16,400
HERE YOU GO, CHIEF.

398
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:20,200
MRS. WALLACE WAS THE ONE
WITH THE MONEY.

399
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:21,600
HERE, LISTEN TO THIS.

400
00:19:22,100 --> 00:19:26,300
SHE, UH, PULLED IN
$900,000 A YEAR

401
00:19:26,300 --> 00:19:28,900
ON HER MUTUAL FUNDS,
TAX-FREE.

402
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,600
PLUS, SHE HAD DIVIDENDS

403
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:33,900
OFF $30 MILLION
WORTH OF OIL STOCK.

404
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:36,900
HMM. NOW,
THIS IS A TOUGH ONE.

405
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:41,100
GUESS WHO THE WALLACES'
BENEFICIARIES ARE.

406
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:41,900
THEIR CHILDREN.

407
00:19:41,900 --> 00:19:43,900
RECENTLY REDUCED TO ONE.

408
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:48,300
THANK YOU, LIEUTENANT.

409
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:51,000
YOU CAN TAKE
THE REST OF THE NIGHT OFF.

410
00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:55,200
WELL, I-I SIGNED OUT
WHEN I LEFT THE OFFICE.

411
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:57,300
YOU KNOW, I'VE NEVER
BEEN A CLOCK WATCHER.

412
00:19:57,300 --> 00:19:59,000
THAT'S ENOUGH FOR NOW.
THANKS.

413
00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:04,900
SO, WISH ME LUCK.

414
00:20:07,900 --> 00:20:09,000
BUDGET CUTS.

415
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:10,900
THANKS, GUYS.

416
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:14,300
IN FACT, POPE SAYS

417
00:20:14,300 --> 00:20:17,500
IF I CAN'T FIND SOME WAY
TO SAVE MONEY, I'LL --

418
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,600
IF YOU CAN'T FIND
SOME WAY TO SAVE MONEY, WHAT?

419
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:21,800
LIEUTENANT PROVENZA
MAY HAVE TO RETIRE.

420
00:20:22,700 --> 00:20:24,500
TESTING. 1, 2, 3.
TESTING.

421
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:28,500
Brenda: <i>TESTING. 1, 2, 3.</i>
 <i>TESTING.</i>

422
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:30,300
I WOKE UP.

423
00:20:31,300 --> 00:20:32,500
MY THROAT WAS REALLY DRY,

424
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:35,200
SO I STARTED TO GO DOWNSTAIRS
TO GET SOME WATER.

425
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:38,500
AND YOU SAW
YOUR SISTER'S BODY?

426
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:42,000
YES, I FOUND
MY LITTLE SISTER, JENNY.

427
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,600
OKAY. SO YOU WALKED
OUT OF YOUR ROOM.

428
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:48,000
AND I YELLED
FOR MY PARENTS.

429
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,000
AND NO ONE ANSWERED,

430
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,700
SO I RAN UP TO MY ROOM
AND CALLED 911,

431
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:56,500
THEN I CLIMBED
INTO THE ATTIC.

432
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,500
DID YOU HEAR
THE POLICE ARRIVE?

433
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:01,400
THERE WERE NO SIRENS
OR ANYTHING.

434
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:10,100
I HEARD NOISES LATER.
I DIDN'T KNOW WHO IT WAS.

435
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:11,600
I COULDN'T MOVE.

436
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:16,400
AND YOU HAVE NO IDEA HOW
THE KILLER OR KILLERS ENTERED?

437
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:18,200
NO.

438
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:20,100
WHAT THEY MIGHT HAVE
BEEN LOOKING FOR?

439
00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:20,800
NO. 

440
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:22,100
OR WHAT TIME
THIS ALL HAPPENED?

441
00:21:23,300 --> 00:21:25,300
I GUESS I MUST HAVE
JUST SLEPT THROUGH IT.

442
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:31,600
SEE, ERIC, I JUST -- I FIND THAT
SO HARD TO BELIEVE.

443
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,100
WHY?

444
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:35,700
I'LL SHOW YOU.

445
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:54,800
OUTSIDE! OUTSIDE NOW!

446
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:00,300
NO!!!

447
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:03,500
STOP.

448
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:05,300
AHHHHH!

449
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:16,300
THAT IS THE MIXTURE
OF SOUNDS

450
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:18,500
THAT THE HUMAN BODY MAKES

451
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:21,000
WHEN SOMEONE
SHOVES A KNIFE IN IT.

452
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,400
THAT'S THE SOUND
THAT YOUR PARENTS MADE

453
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:24,800
WHEN THEY WERE BEING
STABBED TO DEATH.

454
00:22:25,100 --> 00:22:26,300
THAT'S THE SOUND
THAT JENNY HEARD

455
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:27,200
THAT MADE HER
RACE DOWNSTAIRS,

456
00:22:27,700 --> 00:22:30,000
JUST LIKE EVERYONE
RUSHED IN HERE RIGHT NOW.

457
00:22:30,300 --> 00:22:32,000
THAT'S THE SOUND
THAT JENNY MADE

458
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:35,100
UNTIL THE KILLER
STABBED HER IN THE THROAT

459
00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:37,300
10 FEET FROM THE DOOR
OF YOUR ROOM,

460
00:22:37,300 --> 00:22:40,800
WHICH IS WHY I FIND IT
SO HARD TO BELIEVE

461
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:42,700
THAT YOU SLEPT THROUGH IT ALL,
ESPECIALLY SINCE --

462
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:44,900
ESPECIALLY SINCE
YOU WERE HIGH ON MDMA,

463
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,200
ALSO KNOWN AS ECSTASY,
WHICH IS THE DRUG

464
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:50,700
HOSPITAL TESTS CONFIRMED WERE
IN YOUR BLOODSTREAM LAST NIGHT.

465
00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:54,000
"X" IS KIND OF SPEEDY.
IT KEEPS YOU AWAKE.

466
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,600
Brenda: SO, ERIC,
WHEN I FIND A HIGH TEENAGE BOY

467
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:58,000
IN THE ATTIC OF HIS HOUSE

468
00:22:59,100 --> 00:23:01,600
AND HIS ENTIRE FAMILY'S
BEEN STABBED TO DEATH DOWNSTAIRS

469
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:05,500
AND THAT BOY LIES TO BE ABOUT,
WELL, EVERYTHING,

470
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:07,300
I THINK, "MAYBE I SHOULD
JUST ARREST HIM FOR MURDER

471
00:23:07,300 --> 00:23:07,900
AND CALL IT A DAY."

472
00:23:07,900 --> 00:23:10,200
NO, BUT I DIDN'T DO IT.

473
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:13,600
OKAY, I WOULDN'T HAVE.
I COULDN'T DO IT.

474
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:15,200
ALL RIGHT, THEN,
LET'S START OVER AGAIN,

475
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:17,200
AND YOU CAN
TELL ME THE TRUTH THIS TIME.

476
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:19,000
WERE YOU ON DRUGS
LAST NIGHT?

477
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:23,000
YES, I WAS HIGH,
OKAY, BUT I WASN'T HOME.

478
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:24,700
WHERE WERE YOU, THEN?

479
00:23:24,700 --> 00:23:25,800
I SNUCK OUT.

480
00:23:25,900 --> 00:23:26,900
THERE'S A LADDER
IN THE ATTIC

481
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:30,200
THAT I USE TO GET DOWNSTAIRS
WITHOUT MY PARENTS KNOWING.

482
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:31,900
WAIT A MINUTE --
ARE YOU TELLING ME

483
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:35,700
YOU LEFT A WINDOW
TO YOUR BEDROOM UNLOCKED

484
00:23:35,700 --> 00:23:37,100
AND A LADDER
LEANING AGAINST THE HOUSE?

485
00:23:37,100 --> 00:23:39,000
NO.

486
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,900
NO, OKAY?

487
00:23:40,900 --> 00:23:42,700
I LAY THE LADDER DOWN
WHERE IT CAN'T BE SEEN,

488
00:23:42,700 --> 00:23:44,800
AND I PULL IT BACK UP
IN THE ATTIC WHEN I GET HOME.

489
00:23:44,900 --> 00:23:45,900
IT'S WHAT I ALWAYS DO.

490
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
IT'S WHAT YOU ALWAYS DO?

491
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,600
HOW LONG
HAVE YOU BEEN SNEAKING OUT?

492
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:51,200
JUST THE LAST TWO MONTHS.

493
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:56,200
AND WHO ARE YOU SNEAKING OUT
TO SEE, HIGH ON ECSTASY?

494
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:03,600
I NEED A NAME NOW.

495
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:07,400
ERIC DEAN WALLACE,
YOU ARE UNDER ARREST --

496
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:09,000
NO, JUST WAIT! JUST WAIT!

497
00:24:09,100 --> 00:24:10,400
WHO PICKS YOU UP?

498
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,400
OKAY. JUSTIN DARCY.
JUSTIN PICKS ME UP.

499
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:16,400
WHO IS JUSTIN DARCY?

500
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:17,400
HE'S MY MATH TUTOR.

501
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:20,300
WHY DOES JUSTIN
PICK YOU UP?

502
00:24:20,300 --> 00:24:24,300
'CAUSE WE WENT
TO A CLUB...DANCING,

503
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:27,600
AND THEN WE WENT BACK
TO HIS APARTMENT.

504
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:29,600
TO STUDY MATH ON "X"?

505
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:39,300
DID YOUR FATHER FIND OUT

506
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:41,000
YOU WERE SNEAKING OUT
AND WHO YOU WERE WITH?

507
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,600
IS THAT WHAT HAPPENED,
ERIC?

508
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:45,400
WAS YOUR DAD WAITING UP FOR YOU?
DID YOU TWO FIGHT?

509
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:48,700
NO. OKAY? NO, THEY NEVER KNEW.
JUST PLEASE --

510
00:24:48,700 --> 00:24:50,300
DID JUSTIN KNOW
THAT THE WINDOW

511
00:24:50,300 --> 00:24:51,800
TO YOUR BEDROOM
WAS UNLOCKED?

512
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:52,600
DID HE GO BACK?

513
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:54,500
NO, I WAS WITH HIM
THE WHOLE TIME.

514
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:58,900
WHERE DID
YOUR FATHER WORK?

515
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,300
I TOLD YOU.
HE WORKS FOR THE PRISON.

516
00:25:00,300 --> 00:25:02,000
WE HAVE CONTACTED
BOTH THOSE PRISONS,

517
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:05,400
AND NEITHER OF THEM HAVE
EVER HEARD OF YOUR FATHER.

518
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:06,400
NO.

519
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:11,400
NO, NO, BUT HE WORKS THERE.
ASK DR. REICHTER.

520
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:13,300
WHO'S DR. REICHTER?

521
00:25:13,300 --> 00:25:15,700
HE'S A PSYCHOLOGIST.
HE WORKS WITH PRISONERS, OKAY?

522
00:25:15,700 --> 00:25:17,700
HIM AND MY DAD,
THEY WRITE ARTICLES TOGETHER.

523
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:18,500
ASK DR. REICHTER.

524
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:20,900
OKAY, LET'S CALL HIM RIGHT NOW.
WHAT'S HIS NUMBER?

525
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:22,600
I DON'T KNOW.
I DON'T HAVE IT.

526
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:25,300
I JUST HEARD HIS NAME
SAID A LOT.

527
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:27,600
I'M TELLING THE TRUTH, OKAY?
I SWEAR IT.

528
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:30,000
YOU SWEAR IT?!

529
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,300
WELL, YOU'RE SUCH
AN HONEST YOUNG MAN.

530
00:25:31,300 --> 00:25:33,100
WHY WOULD ANYONE
DOUBT YOU?

531
00:25:33,100 --> 00:25:35,000
I'M SORRY, OKAY?
I'M SORRY.

532
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,000
YOU'RE SORRY?

533
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,300
YOU'VE ALREADY ADMITTED
TO LEAVING YOUR HOUSE UNSECURED.

534
00:25:38,300 --> 00:25:39,500
THAT MAKES YOU
PARTIALLY RESPONSIBLE

535
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:40,800
FOR THE MURDER
OF YOUR FAMILY,

536
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:42,900
EVEN IF YOU DIDN'T
KILL THEM YOURSELF.

537
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,600
YOU LIED TO ME
ABOUT WHERE YOU WERE

538
00:25:44,700 --> 00:25:45,700
DURING THE TIME
OF THE MURDER,

539
00:25:45,700 --> 00:25:47,500
AND THE BEST YOU CAN
MANAGE IS, "I'M SORRY"?

540
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:48,800
WELL, WHAT DO YOU
WANT ME TO SAY?!

541
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:52,600
DO YOU THINK "I'M SORRY"
WILL BRING YOUR MOTHER BACK?

542
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:55,000
WHAT CAN
I SAY TO CHANGE --

543
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,400
YOU CAN'T CHANGE THINGS NOW!

544
00:25:56,500 --> 00:25:59,200
NO! I WISH I WAS DEAD!

545
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:01,400
OKAY?! DOES THAT HELP?!
I WISH I WAS DEAD.

546
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:04,600
I WISH WHOEVER
KILLED MY FAMILY KILLED ME!

547
00:26:04,700 --> 00:26:08,500
OKAY, I WISH I WAS DEAD!

548
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:10,100
UHHH!

549
00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:19,100
THOSE ARE THE MAGIC WORDS.

550
00:26:21,100 --> 00:26:23,500
SUICIDE WATCH.

551
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:24,700
72 HOURS SURVEILLANCE.

552
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:31,100
FIRST THING TOMORROW, I WANT TO
INTERVIEW THIS JUSTIN DARCY.

553
00:26:31,100 --> 00:26:34,300
I WANT THAT LADDER
CHECKED FOR PRINTS.

554
00:26:34,300 --> 00:26:36,500
AND I WANT TO TALK
TO DR. REICHTER.

555
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:37,900
YEAH, WELL,
TOMORROW IS SUNDAY.

556
00:26:37,900 --> 00:26:38,700
THERE'S NO OVERTIME.

557
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:40,200
IT CAN'T BE HELPED.

558
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:45,300
I'LL LEAD THE DOCTOR IN
TO SEE HIM.

559
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:49,200
I'M SORRY, MOM.

560
00:26:51,100 --> 00:26:53,300
I'M SORRY, MOM.
I'M SORRY, JENNY.

561
00:26:54,500 --> 00:26:57,000
SO IN SEVERAL OF HIS ARTICLES
ABOUT PRISON LIFE,

562
00:26:57,100 --> 00:26:59,700
MR. WALLACE
QUOTES A DR. ROBERT REICHTER.

563
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:03,000
AND SO I CALLED THE PRISONS
AT TERMINAL ISLAND AND LOMPOC,

564
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,800
AND REICHTER'S A PSYCHOLOGIST
AT BOTH FACILITIES.

565
00:27:06,100 --> 00:27:08,800
LIVES IN LOMPOC,
BUT HE'S OFF THIS WEEKEND.

566
00:27:08,900 --> 00:27:10,300
WELL,
CAN'T WE CALL HIM?

567
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:11,600
WOULDN'T THEY GIVE YOU
HIS HOME NUMBER?

568
00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:14,300
NOT OVER THE PHONE.
HE'S A FEDERAL PRISON EMPLOYEE.

569
00:27:14,300 --> 00:27:17,100
I COULDN'T EVEN GET HIS DRIVER'S
LICENSE ON A SEARCH.

570
00:27:17,100 --> 00:27:20,800
UM, WHAT ABOUT THE LETTER
AT THE WALLACES' HOUSE?

571
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:24,000
OH, I GOT THREE SETS
OF PRINTS.

572
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,800
ONE'S ERIC'S.
ONE'S HIS FATHER'S.

573
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:30,500
ONE WE COULDN'T IDENTIFY.
RAN IT THROUGH AFIS -- NO HIT.

574
00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:31,800
IT COULD HAVE BEEN A GARDENER
OR SOMETHING.

575
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:35,800
OR IT COULD BE OUR FRIEND
JUSTIN DARCY.

576
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,600
HE'S IN THE INTERVIEW ROOM RIGHT
NOW WITH FLYNN AND SANCHEZ.

577
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:42,100
SO WALLACE DIDN'T
WORK AT THE PRISONS THEMSELVES,

578
00:27:42,100 --> 00:27:43,800
BUT MAYBE HE DID WORK
WITH THE PRISON EMPLOYEES?

579
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:45,300
THANK YOU, DOCTOR.

580
00:27:45,300 --> 00:27:48,500
OKAY, SO, THE SUICIDE WATCH
FROM LAST NIGHT IS OFFICIAL,

581
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:50,300
AND THE DOCTOR SAYS
HE CAN KEEP ERIC SEDATED

582
00:27:50,300 --> 00:27:52,800
UNLESS YOU
WANT TO TALK TO HIM.

583
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:54,200
SUICIDE WATCH?

584
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:58,600
HI, EVERYBODY.

585
00:28:06,300 --> 00:28:08,300
ERIC WALLACE
SAID HE WISHED HE WAS DEAD.

586
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:11,100
DO YOU WANT ME TO HOLD
A SUICIDAL TEENAGER HERE, WILL?

587
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:12,400
I WANT YOU TO ARREST THE KID,

588
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:14,200
PUT HIM IN THE CUSTODY
OF THE SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT

589
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:15,800
AND LET THEM PAY
FOR THE SUICIDE WATCH.

590
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:18,900
IF I ARREST HIM,
WILL, HE'LL GET AN ATTORNEY.

591
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:20,600
OR DON'T YOU WANT ME
TO GET A CONFESSION?

592
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:22,100
YOU HAVE A STRONG
CIRCUMSTANTIAL CASE.

593
00:28:22,100 --> 00:28:23,400
BUT I STILL HAVE
A LOT OF QUESTIONS,

594
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:26,100
LIKE WHY DOES ERIC INSIST THAT
HIS FATHER WORKS AT PRISONS?

595
00:28:26,100 --> 00:28:28,000
WHY WERE THE ROOMS
IN THE HOUSE TOSSED,

596
00:28:28,100 --> 00:28:29,500
BUT NOTHING
SEEMS TO BE STOLEN?

597
00:28:30,100 --> 00:28:34,100
AND WHAT ABOUT THE CLOTHES
IN THE WASHER?

598
00:28:35,900 --> 00:28:37,400
AND THERE'S
A PRISON PSYCHOLOGIST,

599
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:38,300
??????

600
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:39,500
AND THE FEDS
WON'T GIVE ME HIS NUMBER,

601
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:42,300
AND I NEED TO TALK
TO HIM IN THE WORST WAY.

602
00:28:42,300 --> 00:28:43,300
DO YOU HAVE A MOTIVE?

603
00:28:43,300 --> 00:28:44,500
MR. WALLACE
MAY HAVE DISCOVERED

604
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:46,600
HIS SON WAS SLIPPING OUT
TO MEET A BOYFRIEND.

605
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:48,800
ARGUMENTS ABOUT STUFF LIKE THAT
HAVE A WAY OF ESCALATING.

606
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:50,900
AND ERIC WAS TO INHERIT
MILLIONS OF DOLLARS.

607
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:54,300
SO, MOTIVE, MEANS,
OPPORTUNITY, SUSPECT.

608
00:28:54,300 --> 00:28:56,800
IS IT REALLY NECESSARY
TO CALL IN EVERYONE ON EARTH

609
00:28:56,800 --> 00:28:59,100
ON SUNDAY
TO TIE UP THE LOOSE ENDS?

610
00:28:59,100 --> 00:29:01,500
I DON'T HAVE
EVERYONE ON EARTH HERE.

611
00:29:02,300 --> 00:29:04,700
I HAVE NO CIVILIAN ASSISTANTS
AT ALL.

612
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:07,800
HEY, CHIEF -- SORRY.

613
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:09,500
UM, LIEUTENANT FLYNN
WANTED ME TO TELL YOU

614
00:29:09,500 --> 00:29:12,100
THAT HE JUST MIRANDIZED
THE JUSTIN DARCY GUY ON TAPE.

615
00:29:12,100 --> 00:29:15,000
OKAY. THANK YOU, BUZZ.
I'LL BE THERE IN A MINUTE.

616
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,600
YOU'RE WELCOME.

617
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:19,400
REALLY?
NO CIVILIANS AT ALL? HMM.

618
00:29:20,900 --> 00:29:24,000
YOU KNOW, LOOK, IF YOU ARE
THIS WORRIED ABOUT MONEY,

619
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,300
YOU KNOW
WHAT IS REALLY CHEAP?

620
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:27,500
NOT SOLVING THE CRIME.

621
00:29:30,900 --> 00:29:32,900
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE,
ANYWAY?

622
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,800
DON'T YOU SPEND SUNDAY
WITH YOUR KIDS?

623
00:29:34,900 --> 00:29:35,700
THEY'RE WITH THEIR MOTHER.

624
00:29:37,300 --> 00:29:39,700
ESTELLE TAKES THEM
TO THEME PARKS.

625
00:29:39,700 --> 00:29:41,400
I GET TO TURN OFF
THE TELEVISION,

626
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:43,400
MAKE THEM EAT THEIR VEGETABLES,
AND PUT THEM TO BED.

627
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:49,000
GUESS WHO THEY PREFER
SPENDING TIME WITH.

628
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,900
WHAT ALL THAT MEANS
IS THAT I ALREADY UNDERSTAND

629
00:29:51,900 --> 00:29:55,500
HOW HARD IT IS
TO SPLIT UP A FAMILY.

630
00:29:55,500 --> 00:29:57,100
AND SINCE YOU DON'T
SEEM TO BE TAKING ME SERIOUSLY,

631
00:29:57,100 --> 00:29:59,500
LET ME REMIND YOU
THAT TOMORROW I NEED THE NAME

632
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:03,500
OF THE DETECTIVE YOU'RE
RELEASING FROM THIS SQUAD.

633
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:05,300
NO. NO, NO.

634
00:30:05,300 --> 00:30:07,700
I'M ACTIVELY LOOKING
FOR THE MONEY WE NEED TO SAVE.

635
00:30:07,700 --> 00:30:09,700
YEAH, BUT YOU'RE ACTIVELY
SEARCHING FOR IT

636
00:30:09,700 --> 00:30:10,900
AT TIME AND A HALF.

637
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:12,300
LOOK, HERE'S THE SOLUTION.

638
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:14,600
PROVENZA RETIRES,

639
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:18,600
OR YOU SEND SOMEONE
TO COUNTERTERRORISM TOMORROW.

640
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:27,500
GOOD MORNING, MR. DARCY.

641
00:30:27,500 --> 00:30:30,500
I'M DEPUTY CHIEF
BRENDA LEIGH JOHNSON, LAPD,

642
00:30:30,500 --> 00:30:33,900
AND I HAVE BROUGHT YOU IN
THIS MORNING TO TALK ABOUT RAPE.

643
00:30:33,900 --> 00:30:37,900
I HAVEN'T RAPED
ANYONE EVER.

644
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,500
Brenda:
 <i>I HAVE A STATEMENT</i>

645
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:42,200
 <i>ALLEGING SEXUAL ASSAULT</i>
 <i>FROM YOUR VICTIM.</i>

646
00:30:42,300 --> 00:30:44,300
DO YOU KNOW
HOW STUPID THAT IS?

647
00:30:44,300 --> 00:30:47,100
I THINK I SHOULD GET MY ONE
PHONE CALL AND TALK TO MY DAD.

648
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:49,400
HE'S A CRIMINAL ATTORNEY,
OKAY?

649
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:51,500
SO I THINK I KNOW A BIT MORE
ABOUT THE JUSTICE SYSTEM

650
00:30:51,500 --> 00:30:55,100
THAN THE AVERAGE PERSON
YOU DRAG IN HERE.

651
00:30:55,100 --> 00:30:55,700
LIEUTENANT FLYNN,

652
00:30:55,700 --> 00:30:59,200
WOULD YOU PLEASE
HAND MR. DARCY YOUR PHONE?

653
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:01,000
AS I'M SURE YOU'RE AWARE,
MR. DARCY,

654
00:31:01,100 --> 00:31:03,400
GIVEN YOUR VAST KNOWLEDGE
OF THE LAW,

655
00:31:03,500 --> 00:31:05,600
THAT THE AGE OF CONSENT
FOR MALE-MALE SEX

656
00:31:05,700 --> 00:31:08,400
IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA
IS 18.

657
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:11,500
I'M 19 IN 2 MONTHS.

658
00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:13,900
MANY HAPPY RETURNS.

659
00:31:13,900 --> 00:31:14,700
ERIC WALLACE,

660
00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:18,700
THE BOY WHOM YOU ARE
CURRENTLY TUTORING, IS 17.

661
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:21,000
MAKE SURE
TO TELL YOUR FATHER

662
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,400
THAT THE CHARGES AGAINST YOU
WILL INCLUDE

663
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:25,200
BUT WILL NOT
NECESSARILY BE LIMITED TO

664
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:28,300
STATUTORY RAPE
AND SEX WITH A MINOR.

665
00:31:28,300 --> 00:31:30,100
I LOOK FORWARD
TO MEETING YOUR FAMILY.

666
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:33,100
I CAN ONLY IMAGINE
HOW PROUD THEY'LL BE.

667
00:31:33,100 --> 00:31:35,600
HEY, I'LL DIAL YOUR DAD.
WHAT'S THE NUMBER?

668
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:37,000
WAIT. OKAY.

669
00:31:37,100 --> 00:31:39,800
WAIT. NO,
I NEVER HAD SEX WITH ERIC.

670
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:41,500
IF THAT'S TRUE,
WE'LL BE ARRESTING

671
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:44,700
YOUR UNDERAGE BOYFRIEND
FOR THE MURDER OF HIS FAMILY.

672
00:31:44,700 --> 00:31:45,400
WHAT?

673
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:46,400
Flynn:
THE NIGHT BEFORE LAST,

674
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:47,700
ERIC'S PARENTS
AND HIS SISTER

675
00:31:47,700 --> 00:31:50,100
WERE FOUND STABBED TO DEATH
IN THEIR HOME.

676
00:31:50,100 --> 00:31:52,500
Oh,my God!

677
00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:54,800
ERIC GAVE A STATEMENT
SAYING THAT HE WAS WITH YOU

678
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:56,300
DURING THE TIME OF THE MURDER,
DANCING AND CARRYING ON,

679
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:58,400
??????,AND I DON'T KNOW
WHAT ALL.

680
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:02,300
SO WHO'S THE LIAR --
YOU OR ERIC?

681
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,900
 <i>SO WHAT YOU'RE SAYING</i>
 <i>IS EITHER I'M A SEX OFFENDER...</i>

682
00:32:07,900 --> 00:32:10,600
I THINK I FOUND WHAT
THE MURDERER WAS LOOKING FOR.

683
00:32:10,700 --> 00:32:12,300
 <i>...OR ERIC'S A KILLER?</i>

684
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:14,600
MAYBE YOU PICKED ERIC UP,
DROPPED HIM OFF AT YOUR PLACE,

685
00:32:14,700 --> 00:32:17,400
WENT BACK, AND MURDERED
HIS PARENTS YOURSELF.

686
00:32:17,500 --> 00:32:19,500
YOU KNEW
THERE WAS A WINDOW OPEN.

687
00:32:19,500 --> 00:32:22,700
NO. WAIT. WAIT.
NO. OKAY.

688
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:26,300
YES, I PICKED HIM UP
FRIDAY NIGHT.

689
00:32:26,300 --> 00:32:27,400
YES, OKAY?

690
00:32:27,500 --> 00:32:31,500
BUT -- BUT IF HIS PARENTS DIED
BEFORE 3:00 IN THE MORNING,

691
00:32:32,100 --> 00:32:34,800
HE DIDN'T DO IT,
AND NEITHER DID I.

692
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:37,600
DO YOU HAVE SOMEONE
THAT CAN BACK UP THAT STORY?

693
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:41,600
YEAH. YEAH, WE MET UP
WITH SOME FRIENDS

694
00:32:41,700 --> 00:32:44,600
WHEN WE WENT OUT DANCING.

695
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:45,500
WRITE IT ALL DOWN --

696
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:47,200
EVERYWHERE YOU WENT,
EVERYONE YOU SAW --

697
00:32:47,300 --> 00:32:49,200
NAME, NUMBERS, TIMES.

698
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:50,100
EXCUSE ME.

699
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:57,800
EXPLAIN, PLEASE.

700
00:32:57,800 --> 00:33:00,200
THE WALLACES' CARRIER
SAID THEY HAD FOUR CELLPHONES.

701
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:02,600
DANIELS
FOUND THIS ONE CHARGING

702
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:04,600
BEHIND THE WET BAR
IN THE DEN OF THEIR HOUSE.

703
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:06,400
WE THOUGHT IT WAS
ONE OF THE FOUR IN THE PLAN.

704
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:08,300
IT TURNS OUT IT ISN'T.

705
00:33:08,300 --> 00:33:09,600
WHOSE IS IT, THEN?

706
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:13,600
WELL, IT BELONGS TO, UH,
DR. ROBERT REICHTER.

707
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:19,000
ARE YOU TELLING ME
THAT THE WALLACES

708
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:20,500
HAD REICHTER'S PHONE
IN THEIR DEN

709
00:33:20,500 --> 00:33:22,200
AND WE'RE JUST FINDING OUT
ABOUT THIS NOW?

710
00:33:25,100 --> 00:33:27,000
I ORDERED
THE PHONE DUMPS LAST NIGHT.

711
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:28,600
THEY COULDN'T
GET IT BACK TO US TILL TODAY,

712
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:30,700
SO I SIGNED OUT,
LID YOU ASKED,

713
00:33:30,700 --> 00:33:34,700
AND I JUST STARTED
DOWNLOADING CELLS A MINUTE AGO.

714
00:33:34,700 --> 00:33:38,700
YOU DON'T BELIEVE THIS
LITTLE PRICK'S STORY, DO YOU?

715
00:33:36,500 --> 00:33:38,500
PLEASE SIT WITH MR. DARCY

716
00:33:38,500 --> 00:33:40,200
UNTIL I'M READY
TO SPEAK WITH HIM AGAIN.

717
00:33:43,300 --> 00:33:44,600
[ DOOR CLOSES ]
IMPOSSIBLE!

718
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:48,800
SO, WERE THERE ANY CALLS

719
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:50,900
FROM DR. REICHTER'S CELL
I SHOULD KNOW ABOUT?

720
00:33:50,900 --> 00:33:52,600
Gabriel: YES, MA'AM,
DR. REICHTER

721
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:55,900
WAS CALLING ERIC WALLACE
ON A FAIRLY REGULAR BASIS.

722
00:33:57,500 --> 00:33:58,400
NOT THE FATHER?

723
00:33:58,400 --> 00:34:00,500
NO, MA'AM,
HE WAS CALLING THE SON.

724
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:03,800
ERIC WALLACE TOLD ME HE'D
NEVER SPOKEN TO DR. REICHTER,

725
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:06,700
THAT...
HE HAD ONLY HEARD THE NAME.

726
00:34:07,900 --> 00:34:09,100
OKAY, JUST...

727
00:34:10,100 --> 00:34:11,700
JUST GIVE ME
A SECOND HERE.

728
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:14,000
THESE BAD LIES
ARE CONFUSING ME.

729
00:34:15,900 --> 00:34:18,800
WE FOUND FOUR CELLPHONES
AT THE WALLACES' HOUSE.

730
00:34:19,300 --> 00:34:21,700
DR. REICHTER'S WAS
ONE OF THE FOUR PHONES WE FOUND.

731
00:34:21,700 --> 00:34:23,000
SO WHOSE PHONE'S MISSING?

732
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,500
MR. WALLACE'S, BUT WE HAVE
THE DUMP OFF OF HIS NUMBER.

733
00:34:26,500 --> 00:34:27,700
WERE THERE ANY CALLS MADE

734
00:34:27,700 --> 00:34:29,900
ON DR. WALLACE'S PHONE
SINCE HIS DEATH?

735
00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:32,600
AT AROUND 1:00 A.M.
SATURDAY MORNING,

736
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:36,200
SOMEONE MADE 15 CALLS IN A ROW
FROM MR. WALLACE'S CELLPHONE

737
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:37,800
TO THE PHONE
YOU'RE HOLDING IN YOUR HAND.

738
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:44,600
OKAY, SO THE KILLER
GRABBED MR. WALLACE'S CELLPHONE

739
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:46,000
AND STARTED
WALKING AROUND WITH IT,

740
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,500
AND CALLING
DR. REICHTER'S CELL.

741
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:50,600
Daniels: HOPING REICHTER'S
CELL WOULD RING,

742
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:52,600
BUT REICHTER'S PHONE
WAS OFF.

743
00:34:52,900 --> 00:34:55,400
CHARGING BEHIND THE WET BAR
IN THE DEN,

744
00:34:55,500 --> 00:34:56,900
MAYBE LIKE IT WAS HIDDEN.

745
00:34:57,800 --> 00:34:59,600
SO THE PHONE
I'M HOLDING IN MY HAND --

746
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:01,100
DR. REICHTER'S PHONE --

747
00:35:01,100 --> 00:35:03,200
THIS IS WHAT THE KILLER
WAS LOOKING FOR.

748
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:05,400
OKAY.

749
00:35:07,900 --> 00:35:09,100
THERE ARE --
THERE ARE NO PICTURES IN HERE,

750
00:35:09,100 --> 00:35:14,000
ONLY...SIX...
PROGRAMMED NUMBERS.

751
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:18,600
NOW, WHY WOULD
THIS PHONE BE WORTH HIDING,

752
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:20,900
AND WHY
WAS DR. REICHTER'S PHONE

753
00:35:20,900 --> 00:35:23,000
AT THE WALLACES' HOUSE
IN THE FIRST PLACE?

754
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,300
THAT'S THE REALLY
IMPORTANT QUESTION,

755
00:35:25,300 --> 00:35:27,100
AND WE WOULD HAVE KNOWN
TO ASK IT YESTERDAY

756
00:35:27,100 --> 00:35:29,800
IF IT WEREN'T FOR ALL
THIS MALARKEY ABOUT BUDGET CUTS.

757
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:33,600
NOW I REALLY NEED
TO SEE THOSE VISITORS LISTS

758
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:35,500
FROM TERMINAL ISLAND
AND LOMPOC.

759
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:38,500
CHIEF, I KNOW YOU'RE
NOT GONNA WANT TO HEAR THIS,

760
00:35:38,500 --> 00:35:40,900
BUT THE GUY WHO COULD
HELP CUT THROUGH SOME OF
THIS RED TAPE --

761
00:35:40,900 --> 00:35:44,800
I KNOW. I KNOW.
I JUST -- I KNOW.

762
00:35:46,100 --> 00:35:47,900
Taylor: LET'S LOOK
FOR THIS GUY WALLACE

763
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:51,200
THROUGH ABOUT, UH,
SIX MONTHS BACK.

764
00:35:52,500 --> 00:35:55,400
OH. OH,
YOU'RE DR. REICHTER'S PARENTS.

765
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:56,900
BOTH PRISONS
WOULD BE GREAT.

766
00:35:56,900 --> 00:35:59,000
GOODNESS, I DON'T KNOW
HOW I COULD HAVE MIXED THAT UP.

767
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,800
THANK YOU.
I OWE YOU A DINNER.
UNLESS HE'S VISITING YOU.

768
00:36:02,300 --> 00:36:07,000
OH. OH, HE'S IN L.A.
FOR THE WEEK. RIGHT.

769
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:09,800
OKAY. WELL,
I-I'M SORRY ABOUT THAT.

770
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:11,400
THANK YOU SO MUCH
FOR YOUR HELP.

771
00:36:11,700 --> 00:36:14,100
ALL RIGHT.
THANK YOU. BYE.

772
00:36:14,100 --> 00:36:17,400
OKAY, SO THAT'S
DR. REICHTER'S WIFE, SISTER,

773
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:19,800
SON, AND PARENTS
ALL TELLING ME THAT HE'S IN L.A.

774
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:21,700
AT THE SAME QUALITY INN
BY THE HARBOR.

775
00:36:21,700 --> 00:36:23,300
THE BLACK-AND-WHITES
I SENT THERE SAY

776
00:36:23,300 --> 00:36:26,300
REICHTER NEVER CHECKED OUT,
AT LEAST NOT UNDER HIS OWN NAME.

777
00:36:26,300 --> 00:36:27,800
DANIELS DRAGGED
HIS CREDIT CARDS,

778
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:29,400
AND DR. REICHTER
STOPPED USING THEM.

779
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:31,900
OH. I'M SORRY. I'M SORRY.

780
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:33,000
IT'S OKAY.

781
00:36:34,900 --> 00:36:36,900
WELL, IF THERE'S ANYONE
WHO KNOWS

782
00:36:36,900 --> 00:36:38,000
HOW TO MANAGE THEIR MONEY

783
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:39,600
SO AS NOT TO GET CAUGHT
BY THE POLICE,

784
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:41,300
IT WOULD
BE A PRISON SHRINK.

785
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:44,100
THE FIRST THING
THEY HEAR FROM CONVICTS
AFTER "I'M INNOCENT"

786
00:36:44,100 --> 00:36:45,800
IS HOW EVERYONE GOT CAUGHT.

787
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:50,000
REICHTER'S PROBABLY BEEN TOLD
HOW TO STAY OFF THE GRID,

788
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,600
HOW TO ESTABLISH AN ALIAS,

789
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:53,800
HOW TO GET OVERSEAS
WITH LOTS OF CASH.

790
00:36:54,900 --> 00:36:58,700
HAVE YOU DECIDED HOW
YOU'RE RECONFIGURING YOUR SQUAD?

791
00:36:58,700 --> 00:37:02,900
BECAUSE I THINK I HAVE
AN IDEA THAT MIGHT BE OF HELP.

792
00:37:02,900 --> 00:37:03,700
Man:
Hello, Mr. Taylor?

793
00:37:03,700 --> 00:37:05,100
I'M HERE. I'M HERE.

794
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:09,600
WALLACE NEVER
VISITED EITHER FACILITY?

795
00:37:11,500 --> 00:37:13,600
WELL, UH...
THANKS FOR LOOKING.

796
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:15,700
BACK AT YOU.

797
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:20,900
SO ERIC JUST FABRICATED
HIS FATHER'S WORK LIFE?

798
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:31,200
WHY DON'T YOU
GIVE ME GABRIEL?

799
00:37:32,300 --> 00:37:32,900
EXCUSE ME?

800
00:37:32,900 --> 00:37:35,400
AND I'LL HANDLE
ALL FURTHER TRANSFERS

801
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:38,000
AND RETIREMENTS THAT WE NEED
TO MAKE OUR BUDGET WORK

802
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,900
FROM THE DEPARTMENTS
THAT REPORT TO ME.

803
00:37:39,900 --> 00:37:41,600
I'LL EVEN SHARE GABRIEL
WITH YOU

804
00:37:42,100 --> 00:37:44,000
ON THE BIG CASES
WHEN YOU NEED HIM.

805
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:47,500
SO YOU'RE SUGGESTING
THAT GABRIEL

806
00:37:47,500 --> 00:37:49,200
SPEND PART OF HIS TIME
WITH YOU AND...

807
00:37:50,700 --> 00:37:51,900
PART OF HIS TIME
WITH ME?

808
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:54,400
IT'S IN THE KID'S
BEST INTEREST, CHIEF.

809
00:37:54,500 --> 00:37:56,700
YOU ALREADY
HAVE THREE LIEUTENANTS.

810
00:37:56,700 --> 00:37:58,600
WHAT CHANCE
DOES GABRIEL HAVE

811
00:37:58,600 --> 00:38:00,500
FOR A PROMOTION
WORKING FOR YOU?

812
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:05,400
I'LL, UH --
I'LL DISCUSS IT WITH HIM

813
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:06,700
ON MY WAY UP TO LOMPOC.

814
00:38:06,700 --> 00:38:08,700
YOU'RE GOING TO
LOMPOC NOW?

815
00:38:08,700 --> 00:38:10,300
I AM, AND, UH...

816
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:14,100
I APPRECIATE
THE SUGGESTION, COMMANDER.

817
00:38:14,100 --> 00:38:16,000
THANK YOU.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

818
00:38:16,100 --> 00:38:17,500
HAPPY TO HELP, CHIEF.

819
00:38:24,700 --> 00:38:26,800
NO, THANK YOU.
THANK YOU, SIR.

820
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:29,800
OKAY, LOMPOC POLICE
FOUND A FRIENDLY JUDGE,

821
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:31,900
AND YOUR WARRANT
WILL BE READY WHEN WE ARRIVE.

822
00:38:31,900 --> 00:38:33,200
OKAY, THANK YOU.

823
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:39,200
UH...SO, SERGEANT,
THERE'S THIS OTHER THING.

824
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:40,100
UM...

825
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:44,400
COMMANDER TAYLOR SUGGESTED
THAT YOU MIGHT WANT TO

826
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:45,900
GO BACK TO WORK FOR HIM.

827
00:38:45,900 --> 00:38:49,000
HE THINKS IT MIGHT IMPROVE
YOUR CHANCES OF PROMOTION.

828
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:52,500
IN RETURN, HE WOULD ABSORB
ALL FUTURE BUDGET CUTS.

829
00:38:52,900 --> 00:38:54,700
AND I PROMISED
I'D MENTION IT TO YOU.

830
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:59,800
IS...THAT...
WHAT YOU WANT ME TO DO?

831
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:01,900
YOU WANT ME TO GO BACK
AND WORK FOR TAYLOR?

832
00:39:01,900 --> 00:39:02,900
HARDLY.

833
00:39:03,700 --> 00:39:05,600
BUT, UM, IF YOU THINK

834
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:08,200
IT'S IN YOUR OWN
LONG-TERM BEST INTEREST --

835
00:39:08,200 --> 00:39:09,000
WELL, I MEAN, I DON'T KNOW

836
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,600
THAT LAPD
IS GONNA BE MY WHOLE CAREER.

837
00:39:12,300 --> 00:39:15,900
IN FACT, I WAS THINKING
MAYBE ABOUT GOING INTO POLITICS.

838
00:39:15,900 --> 00:39:16,800
YOU'RE KIDDING.

839
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:18,700
WELL, I HAVE
A LAW-ENFORCEMENT BACKGROUND,

840
00:39:18,700 --> 00:39:20,600
A MASTER'S
IN PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION.

841
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:26,500
HEY, THIS, UH --
THIS ISN'T THE WAY TO LOMPOC.

842
00:39:26,500 --> 00:39:28,400
NO, WE'RE GOING TO
THE AIRPORT.

843
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:30,600
WE'RE TAKING
THE LAPD PLANE?

844
00:39:30,700 --> 00:39:33,000
I THOUGHT YOU WERE
SUPPOSED TO BE SAVING MONEY.

845
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,900
NO, SERGEANT, WE ARE SUPPOSED TO
BE FINDING A MURDERER,

846
00:39:35,900 --> 00:39:38,300
AND WE ARE NOT DOING IT
IN THE CAR-POOL LANE.

847
00:39:46,300 --> 00:39:48,000
THANKS FOR THE ESCORT
FROM THE AIRPORT, CAPTAIN.

848
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,200
OUR PLEASURE.

849
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:51,000
WE TRAIN FOR THIS
KIND OF THING A LOT,

850
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:52,800
BUT WE DON'T GET TO DO IT
AS MUCH AS YOU GUYS.

851
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:55,300
YOU WOULDN'T KNOW IT.
EVERYONE HERE LOOKS VERY SHARP.

852
00:39:55,400 --> 00:39:56,400
THANKS, SON.

853
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:00,000
WE'LL JUST FAX
THAT BILL DOWN TO...
CHIEF WILL POPE.

854
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,700
I'LL GIVE YOU THE NUMBER
WHEN WE'RE DONE HERE.

855
00:40:03,100 --> 00:40:04,400
THINK DR. REICHTER'S HERE?

856
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:06,400
NO, SERGEANT,
DR. REICHTER'S DEAD.

857
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:09,300
YES -- OH, MY GOD.

858
00:40:09,300 --> 00:40:11,100
ARE YOU
MISS KATHY REICHTER?

859
00:40:11,100 --> 00:40:12,600
YES.
WHAT'S GOING ON HERE?

860
00:40:12,600 --> 00:40:14,100
IS THERE SOMETHING WRONG
WITH ROBERT?

861
00:40:14,100 --> 00:40:15,900
WE'RE HERE
TO SERVE A SEARCH WARRANT.

862
00:40:15,900 --> 00:40:18,200
IF YOU COULD STEP ASIDE
AND MOVE AWAY FROM THE DOOR.

863
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:21,500
DOOR ON THE LEFT.
CLOSE RIGHT.

864
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:25,700
MOM, WHAT'S GOING ON?

865
00:40:25,700 --> 00:40:26,800
TWO STEPS BACK.

866
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:30,500
DEPUTY CHIEF JOHNSON, LAPD.
AND YOU ARE?

867
00:40:30,500 --> 00:40:31,500
KIM REICHTER.

868
00:40:31,500 --> 00:40:33,100
DO YOU KNOW
WHERE YOUR FATHER IS?

869
00:40:33,100 --> 00:40:35,100
LOS ANGELES
UNTIL WEDNESDAY.

870
00:40:35,100 --> 00:40:36,500
WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME
YOU SPOKE TO HIM?

871
00:40:36,500 --> 00:40:38,800
FRIDAY NIGHT. MOM,
WHAT IS HE DOING OVER THERE?

872
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:42,100
LEAVE THOSE PICTURES ALONE!
YOU CAN'T INVADE OUR PRIVACY!

873
00:40:42,100 --> 00:40:43,400
MOM...
BUT WHAT ARE THEY
LOOKING FOR?!

874
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:45,500
MOM!
I HAVE A RIGHT TO KNOW!
WHY ARE YOU HERE?

875
00:40:45,500 --> 00:40:46,300
ANSWER ME!

876
00:40:47,100 --> 00:40:48,300
ANSWER ME!
HEY!

877
00:40:49,900 --> 00:40:53,100
MRS. REICHTER,
MEET KEVIN ALAN WALLACE.

878
00:40:58,600 --> 00:41:01,600
Brenda: DID YOU KNOW
YOUR HUSBAND WAS A BIGAMIST?

879
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:04,900
IT'S JUST...

880
00:41:06,500 --> 00:41:08,100
HARD TO TAKE IN
EVERYTHING.

881
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:10,900
AND, UH...

882
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:16,100
ALL OF THE OTHER FAMILY
WERE STABBED TO DEATH?

883
00:41:16,100 --> 00:41:17,600
EXCEPT THE SON, YES.

884
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:23,700
DR. REICHTER
LEFT LOMPOC ON FRIDAY.

885
00:41:23,700 --> 00:41:25,800
WEREN'T YOU WORRIED
WHEN YOU DIDN'T HEAR FROM HIM?

886
00:41:26,500 --> 00:41:28,200
 <i>WE'RE USED TO</i>
 <i>ROBERT'S SCHEDULE.</i>

887
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:31,700
 <i>HE USED TO COME</i>
 <i>TO TERMINAL ISLAND HERE IN L.A.</i>

888
00:41:31,700 --> 00:41:33,000
 <i>EVERY OTHER WEEK,</i>

889
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:36,300
AND I'M ON NIGHTS
AT THE PRISON IN LOMPOC.

890
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:38,200
DID YOU WORK ON FRIDAY?

891
00:41:39,900 --> 00:41:40,700
YES.

892
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:43,000
UH, HALF OF OUR
LITTLE MEDICAL STAFF WAS THERE.

893
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:46,800
WE HAD A LIFER
WHO HAS COLON CANCER.

894
00:41:47,700 --> 00:41:49,100
HE WAS VERY SICK.

895
00:41:49,500 --> 00:41:51,800
EXCUSE ME.
ARE YOU LOOKING FOR MY ALIBI?

896
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:53,700
WHAT ABOUT YOUR SON --
KIM?

897
00:41:54,200 --> 00:41:55,400
WHERE WAS HE ON FRIDAY?

898
00:41:57,400 --> 00:41:58,800
WAIT. WAIT, PLEASE.

899
00:42:02,300 --> 00:42:06,700
I KNEW...ABOUT THE WALLACES
FROM THE BEGINNING.

900
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:08,800
I ADMIT.

901
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:12,400
I-IT SOUNDS COMPLICATED,
BUT...

902
00:42:14,600 --> 00:42:17,900
...I WAS THE ONE
THAT ROBERT LOVED, NOT HER.

903
00:42:19,100 --> 00:42:21,800
SHE WAS JUST A --
A CONVENIENCE.

904
00:42:23,100 --> 00:42:24,100
REALLY?

905
00:42:25,400 --> 00:42:27,100
WELL, IF SHE
WAS JUST A CONVENIENCE

906
00:42:27,100 --> 00:42:29,300
AND YOU KNEW ABOUT HER
FROM THE BEGINNING,

907
00:42:29,300 --> 00:42:31,100
I WONDER
WHY YOU'RE USING PRONOUNS

908
00:42:31,100 --> 00:42:34,500
INSTEAD OF HER REAL NAME,
UNLESS YOU DON'T KNOW IT.

909
00:42:51,800 --> 00:42:52,700
HELLO.

910
00:42:52,700 --> 00:42:55,900
HI, SO, I COME BACK TO SEE
HOW THINGS ARE GOING HERE

911
00:42:55,900 --> 00:42:58,600
AND I FIND THAT, FIRST, YOU'VE
HAD A BOY ON SUICIDE WATCH

912
00:42:58,600 --> 00:43:00,600
TRANSPORTED TO YOUR OFFICE
UNDER MEDICAL SUPERVISION.

913
00:43:00,600 --> 00:43:02,000
THAT'S ANOTHER
BILLION DOLLARS.

914
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:03,200
I'M SORRY ABOUT THAT,

915
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:06,800
BUT I NEED ERIC WALLACE
TO IDENTIFY SOME THINGS FOR ME.

916
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:09,700
THEN I HEAR YOU'VE
COMMANDEERED THE DEPARTMENT JET

917
00:43:09,700 --> 00:43:10,800
TO GO TO LOMPOC.

918
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:13,800
BECAUSE I KNEW I HAD TO BRING
BACK PASSENGERS AND FREIGHT.

919
00:43:13,900 --> 00:43:14,900
FREIGHT?

920
00:43:14,900 --> 00:43:17,200
YES. CLOTHES,
FINANCIAL RECORDS, PICTURES.

921
00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:20,800
SO YOU FLEW ROUND-TRIP
TO LOMPOC FOR SCRAPBOOKS?

922
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:23,900
HERE IS A PICTURE OF
MR. WALLACE, ONE OF OUR VICTIMS.

923
00:43:24,700 --> 00:43:25,700
OKAY. SO?

924
00:43:25,800 --> 00:43:28,500
AND HERE IS A PICTURE
OF DR. REICHTER,

925
00:43:29,200 --> 00:43:31,100
THE PRISON PSYCHOLOGIST
FROM LOMPOC.

926
00:43:31,600 --> 00:43:35,000
WOW. SO YOUR MURDER VICTIM
WAS A BIGAMIST?

927
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:37,400
YES, AND NOW I NEED TO
SPEAK TO HIS WIFE AND SON.

928
00:43:37,400 --> 00:43:38,800
SO IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME.

929
00:43:38,900 --> 00:43:41,000
HAVE YOU TALKED TO PROVENZA
ABOUT RETIREMENT YET?

930
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:43,700
NO, SHE HASN'T.
SHOULD SHE?

931
00:43:43,800 --> 00:43:46,100
NO, LIEUTENANT, NO.

932
00:43:48,700 --> 00:43:50,900
AREN'T YOU SUPPOSED TO BE
IN THE ELECTRONICS ROOM?

933
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:07,300
HAVE YOU FIGURED OUT
WHAT YOU'RE GONNA DO ABOUT US?

934
00:44:07,600 --> 00:44:09,100
SERGEANT,
I'VE FIGURED OUT THE CRIME.

935
00:44:09,100 --> 00:44:11,200
I'M KIND OF
PUTTING EVERYTHING ELSE OFF.

936
00:44:11,500 --> 00:44:12,400
WAIT.

937
00:44:14,600 --> 00:44:16,900
IF YOU REALLY DON'T WANT TO
LOSE LIEUTENANT PROVENZA,

938
00:44:16,900 --> 00:44:20,500
I THINK YOU SHOULD...
LET ME GO

939
00:44:20,500 --> 00:44:22,700
AND WORK THINGS OUT
WITH CHIEF POPE.

940
00:44:28,500 --> 00:44:30,200
DO YOU MEAN THAT,
SERGEANT?

941
00:44:31,400 --> 00:44:35,100
I'VE, UM --
I'VE BEEN THINKING ABOUT IT.

942
00:44:36,600 --> 00:44:38,600
AND, YES, MA'AM,
I'LL GO TALK TO HIM

943
00:44:38,600 --> 00:44:40,000
ABOUT IT
WHEN WE'RE THROUGH HERE.

944
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:44,500
ALL RIGHT, THEN,
LET'S GO.

945
00:44:57,400 --> 00:44:59,900
BE SURE.
THIS IS IMPORTANT.

946
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:02,700
I AM.
THESE ARE MY CLOTHES.

947
00:45:03,100 --> 00:45:06,300
OKAY. THANKS.
I'M SORRY.

948
00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:09,500
I KNOW
IT WAS A LONG WAY TO COME

949
00:45:09,500 --> 00:45:10,800
TO HAVE YOUR RIGHTS
READ TO YOU

950
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:12,500
AND TO LOOK
THROUGH YOUR OWN CLOSET,

951
00:45:12,900 --> 00:45:14,700
ESPECIALLY AFTER
WHAT HAPPENED TO YOUR FATHER,

952
00:45:14,700 --> 00:45:17,500
BUT THIS WAS
ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY

953
00:45:17,500 --> 00:45:19,800
TO FIGURE OUT
WHO KILLED YOUR FATHER.

954
00:45:21,300 --> 00:45:22,200
THANKS.

955
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:23,700
WATCH IT.

956
00:45:27,900 --> 00:45:30,300
LOOK,
I DID NOT KILL MY FAMILY!

957
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:33,000
OKAY, FINE.
THEN HELP ME FOR ONCE.

958
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:34,500
WHY SHOULD I?
YOU DON'T BELIEVE ME!

959
00:45:34,500 --> 00:45:36,700
AND WHO'S GONNA HELP ME?!

960
00:45:37,100 --> 00:45:38,000
WHO'S GONNA HELP ME?!

961
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:42,200
WHAT AM I GONNA DO?!
I HAVE NO ONE LEFT!

962
00:45:42,200 --> 00:45:44,600
BUT THAT'S
NOT EXACTLY TRUE.

963
00:45:44,900 --> 00:45:46,400
NOW, I'VE GOT
TWO MORE QUESTIONS FOR YOU,

964
00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:49,400
AND IF YOU TELL ME THE TRUTH,
THEN YOU AND I ARE DONE.

965
00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:53,200
FINE.

966
00:45:53,200 --> 00:45:55,700
OKAY, FIRST,
DID YOUR FATHER CALL YOU A LOT

967
00:45:55,700 --> 00:45:57,200
WHEN HE WAS UP AT LOMPOC?

968
00:45:57,800 --> 00:45:58,900
ALMOST EVERY DAY.

969
00:45:59,200 --> 00:46:02,700
OKAY, AND DO YOU THINK
THAT ANY OF THE CLOTHES

970
00:46:02,700 --> 00:46:04,900
ON THIS RACK MIGHT BE YOURS?

971
00:46:07,300 --> 00:46:11,400
THESE ARE MY SHOES.
I CHANGED THE LACES IN THEM.

972
00:46:13,900 --> 00:46:14,900
THIS IS MY SHIRT.

973
00:46:14,900 --> 00:46:17,600
IT'S GOT A TAG FROM
OUR DRY CLEANERS ON THE COLLAR.

974
00:46:19,600 --> 00:46:22,700
THESE JEANS. YEAH.

975
00:46:23,600 --> 00:46:25,200
I PUT THIS HOLE IN THERE
MYSELF.

976
00:46:26,900 --> 00:46:28,000
THANK YOU, ERIC.

977
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:28,800
YEAH.

978
00:46:29,400 --> 00:46:31,700
WOULD YOU GET MY BAG, PLEASE?
THANK YOU.

979
00:46:40,100 --> 00:46:43,600
AND NOW, UH,
DETECTIVE DANIELS HERE

980
00:46:43,600 --> 00:46:45,900
HAS SOME INFORMATION
WE'D LIKE TO SHARE WITH YOU.

981
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:49,900
INFORMATION LIKE WHAT?

982
00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:52,500
INFORMATION
ABOUT YOUR DAD.

983
00:46:52,500 --> 00:46:53,900
WHY DON'T YOU
HAVE A SEAT?

984
00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:00,900
THANK YOU.
DETECTIVE.

985
00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:08,000
AND THAT WILL BE ALL,
GENTLEMEN. THANKS.

986
00:47:08,800 --> 00:47:10,800
I DON'T WANT TO
BOTHER YOU AGAIN, KIM,

987
00:47:11,100 --> 00:47:13,200
BUT YOU IDENTIFIED
THESE CLOTHES

988
00:47:13,200 --> 00:47:15,500
THAT I BROUGHT IN EARLIER
AS YOURS --

989
00:47:15,600 --> 00:47:20,600
THIS SHIRT AND THESE PANTS
AND THESE SHOES.

990
00:47:21,200 --> 00:47:23,300
AND THEY'RE SO MUCH NICER THAN
YOUR OTHER CLOTHES,

991
00:47:23,300 --> 00:47:25,600
SO I CHECKED
WITH YOUR HALF BROTHER, ERIC,

992
00:47:25,700 --> 00:47:27,500
AND HE SAYS THEY'RE HIS.

993
00:47:27,500 --> 00:47:28,800
AND I KIND OF BELIEVE HIM.

994
00:47:30,200 --> 00:47:33,000
Brenda: <i>NOW, I DON'T KNOW</i>
 <i>IF YOU KNOW THIS, KIM,</i>

995
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:36,900
<i>BUT I CAN ACTUALLY TELL</i>
 <i>FROM THESE CLOTHES</i>

996
00:47:36,900 --> 00:47:39,700
AND FROM THE WOUNDS
IN THE BODY

997
00:47:39,700 --> 00:47:43,300
THE ORDER IN WHICH
YOU MURDERED YOUR FATHER

998
00:47:43,600 --> 00:47:46,800
AND HIS WIFE
AND YOUR HALF SISTER, JENNY.

999
00:47:47,800 --> 00:47:50,900
BECAUSE THE WEAPON THAT
YOU USED -- THE LETTER OPENER --

1000
00:47:50,900 --> 00:47:53,500
ACTUALLY DEGRADED
AS YOU WENT ALONG.

1001
00:47:54,200 --> 00:47:58,000
SO, FIRST,
YOU ATTACKED YOUR FATHER.

1002
00:48:00,200 --> 00:48:01,600
AND THEN HIS WIFE

1003
00:48:01,600 --> 00:48:03,700
HEARD HIM SCREAMING
OR WAS THERE.

1004
00:48:03,800 --> 00:48:05,200
YOU FOUGHT WITH HER.

1005
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:08,400
AND YOU STABBED HER
TO DEATH

1006
00:48:08,700 --> 00:48:10,500
AND THEN WENT BACK
AND FINISHED WITH YOUR DAD.

1007
00:48:10,500 --> 00:48:13,400
JENNY RAN DOWN
TO SEE WHAT WAS THE MATTER.

1008
00:48:13,400 --> 00:48:15,500
YOU CHASED HER
BACK UPSTAIRS...

1009
00:48:17,700 --> 00:48:19,600
STABBED HER TO DEATH,
TOO.

1010
00:48:19,600 --> 00:48:22,800
THESE ARE YOUR CLOTHES,

1011
00:48:23,600 --> 00:48:26,800
WHICH YOU PUT IN THE WASHER
WHILE YOU SHOWERED,

1012
00:48:26,800 --> 00:48:30,000
BUT YOU LOOKED FOR
YOUR FATHER'S CELLPHONE FIRST.

1013
00:48:30,300 --> 00:48:32,800
SO THE STAINS SET IN,

1014
00:48:33,200 --> 00:48:36,100
AND IT'S NO GOOD DRIVING AROUND
IN BLOODY CLOTHES, IS IT?

1015
00:48:36,100 --> 00:48:37,400
SOMEONE MIGHT NOTICE.

1016
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:41,700
SO YOU STOLE THESE CLOTHES
FROM ERIC'S CLOSET.

1017
00:48:41,700 --> 00:48:43,600
AND IT'S NOT SURPRISING
THAT THEY FIT.

1018
00:48:43,600 --> 00:48:46,600
YOU ARE BROTHERS,
AFTER ALL.

1019
00:48:49,300 --> 00:48:52,900
THESE ARE THE FINGERPRINTS
THAT WE FOUND

1020
00:48:52,900 --> 00:48:55,900
ON THE LADDER THAT YOU USED
TO ENTER THE HOUSE.

1021
00:48:55,900 --> 00:48:57,700
NOW, WE HAVEN'T
IDENTIFIED THEM YET, KIM,

1022
00:48:57,700 --> 00:49:00,800
BUT WHEN WE DO,
I'LL BET THEY MATCH YOUR HAND.

1023
00:49:02,200 --> 00:49:05,700
AND SOMEWHERE, YOU STOPPED
TO FILL UP YOUR CAR.

1024
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:08,000
AND I'M GONNA
CHECK THE SURVEILLANCE CAMERAS

1025
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:10,400
OF EVERY GAS STATION
ALONG THE WAY,

1026
00:49:10,400 --> 00:49:13,000
AND I'M GONNA FIND YOU,
KIM,

1027
00:49:13,800 --> 00:49:16,500
SOMEWHERE ALONG THE ROAD
BETWEEN HERE AND LOMPOC.

1028
00:49:16,500 --> 00:49:18,300
I CAN PROMISE YOU THAT.

1029
00:49:20,400 --> 00:49:23,700
NOW, ALL WE HAVE LEFT
TO DECIDE, REALLY --

1030
00:49:23,700 --> 00:49:26,300
AND THIS IS ONLY
IF YOU <i>WANT</i> TO HELP ME --

1031
00:49:27,300 --> 00:49:30,200
IS IF YOU PLANNED ON KILLING
YOUR FATHER AND HIS FAMILY,

1032
00:49:30,200 --> 00:49:32,700
OR IF IT WAS MORE OF
A SPUR-OF-THE-MOMENT TYPE THING,

1033
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:35,300
STABBING YOUR FATHER
AND HIS WIFE.

1034
00:49:35,300 --> 00:49:36,700
LET'S GET
ONE THING STRAIGHT.

1035
00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:41,300
THAT OTHER WOMAN
WASN'T MY FATHER'S WIFE, OKAY?

1036
00:49:42,100 --> 00:49:42,900
OKAY.

1037
00:49:42,900 --> 00:49:45,700
MY MOTHER WAS HIS WIFE,
NOT HER.

1038
00:49:46,100 --> 00:49:47,000
OKAY.

1039
00:49:48,300 --> 00:49:50,100
AND I NEVER
MEANT TO KILL ANYONE.

1040
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:51,900
OKAY.

1041
00:49:57,100 --> 00:49:58,700
HOW DID THAT HAPPEN,
THEN?

1042
00:50:02,200 --> 00:50:04,700
MY FATHER LOANED ME HIS CAR
WHILE MINE WAS IN THE SHOP.

1043
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:07,800
AND I BOUGHT SOME POT,
OKAY?

1044
00:50:10,600 --> 00:50:12,000
AND I WAS HIDING IT
TO TAKE HOME

1045
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:13,800
IN CASE I GOT STOPPED
BY THE POLICE.

1046
00:50:15,100 --> 00:50:17,100
AND THERE'S A ZIPPER
IN THE UPHOLSTERY

1047
00:50:17,100 --> 00:50:19,900
OF THE DRIVER'S SEAT
OF MY DAD'S CAR.

1048
00:50:21,300 --> 00:50:23,200
AND I PULLED IT OPEN,
AND IT ALL JUST...

1049
00:50:25,200 --> 00:50:26,600
FELL IN MY HANDS.

1050
00:50:30,900 --> 00:50:32,900
HIS OTHER DRIVER'S LICENSE,
HIS OTHER CELLPHONE,

1051
00:50:32,900 --> 00:50:34,600
HIS OTHER CREDIT CARDS,
HIS OTHER...

1052
00:50:39,600 --> 00:50:40,700
...LIFE.

1053
00:50:43,300 --> 00:50:46,100
AND I COULDN'T
STOP THINKING ABOUT IT.

1054
00:50:48,600 --> 00:50:49,600
I COULDN'T.

1055
00:51:00,500 --> 00:51:02,100
SO YOU WENT
TO THE OTHER ADDRESS

1056
00:51:02,100 --> 00:51:03,800
ON YOUR FATHER'S
FAKE LICENSE.

1057
00:51:03,800 --> 00:51:05,200
AND THERE THEY ALL WERE...

1058
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:09,400
IN THEIR BIG HOUSE

1059
00:51:09,400 --> 00:51:11,800
WITH THEIR SWIMMING POOL
AND THEIR FANCY CARS.

1060
00:51:11,800 --> 00:51:13,700
AND I TRIED TO STOP GOING.

1061
00:51:16,100 --> 00:51:17,200
BUT I COULDN'T.

1062
00:51:21,300 --> 00:51:23,400
I JUST KEPT
GOING BACK THERE EVERY DAY,

1063
00:51:23,400 --> 00:51:26,800
AND I WOULD JUST WATCH THEM
COME AND GO

1064
00:51:26,800 --> 00:51:28,600
WITH ALL THEIR FRIENDS
AND STUFF.

1065
00:51:28,900 --> 00:51:32,000
AND I SAW ERIC SNEAKING OUT
OF HIS BEDROOM WINDOW.

1066
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:35,000
MY FATHER WOULD HAVE KILLED ME
IF I HAD DONE THAT.

1067
00:51:38,200 --> 00:51:40,700
SO THAT NIGHT,
WHEN HE WENT OUT,

1068
00:51:41,600 --> 00:51:43,300
YOU JUST
WANTED TO SEE HIS ROOM.

1069
00:51:44,800 --> 00:51:45,800
IS THAT RIGHT?

1070
00:51:48,200 --> 00:51:49,600
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT HAPPENED.

1071
00:51:53,900 --> 00:51:55,500
I COULDN'T STOP MYSELF.

1072
00:52:00,400 --> 00:52:02,600
I DIDN'T KNOW THAT GOING
IN THERE WOULD MAKE ME SO --

1073
00:52:02,600 --> 00:52:03,400
SO MAD.

1074
00:52:03,400 --> 00:52:06,200
TWO LAPTOPS, CABLE IN HIS ROOM,
TiVo, VIDEO iPods --

1075
00:52:06,200 --> 00:52:08,300
WE DIDN'T HAVE
ANY OF THAT STUFF!

1076
00:52:09,100 --> 00:52:10,000
AND I WAS STANDING THERE,

1077
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:12,400
AND I SAW THAT PICTURE
OF MY FATHER AND HIM,

1078
00:52:12,400 --> 00:52:14,200
SOME PLACE --
I THINK HAWAII, MAYBE.

1079
00:52:14,200 --> 00:52:16,100
THE NEXT THING I KNOW,
I WAS DOWNSTAIRS,

1080
00:52:16,100 --> 00:52:18,000
AND I WAS YELLING
AT MY DAD.

1081
00:52:19,700 --> 00:52:22,500
AND THAT WOMAN CAME IN,
AND I TOLD HER WHO I WAS,

1082
00:52:22,500 --> 00:52:25,100
AND HE SAID,
"DON'T LISTEN TO THIS KID."

1083
00:52:28,900 --> 00:52:32,000
"HE'S A CONVICT
I WORK WITH IN LOMPOC."

1084
00:52:42,400 --> 00:52:45,200
"HE'S A CONVICT
I WORK WITH."

1085
00:52:49,400 --> 00:52:51,200
THAT'S WHAT MY FATHER
CALLED ME.

1086
00:52:54,300 --> 00:52:56,100
SO I PICKED UP
THAT LITTLE SWORD ON HIS DESK,

1087
00:52:56,100 --> 00:52:58,600
THAT FANCY LETTER OPENER
OR WHATEVER IT WAS,

1088
00:52:58,600 --> 00:53:00,300
AND I STABBED HIM
WITH IT.

1089
00:53:04,100 --> 00:53:05,800
AND THE REST
HAPPENED LIKE YOU SAID.

1090
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:12,600
YOU BROKE
INTO YOUR FATHER'S CAR?

1091
00:53:13,700 --> 00:53:14,500
YEAH.

1092
00:53:17,600 --> 00:53:19,900
I COULDN'T FIND
WHERE HE KEPT THE KEYS TO IT.

1093
00:53:22,100 --> 00:53:24,300
I GOT HIS REAL DRIVER'S LICENSE
OUT OF THE SEAT,

1094
00:53:24,300 --> 00:53:25,900
HIS REAL CREDIT CARDS,
AND I THOUGHT...

1095
00:53:29,900 --> 00:53:31,800
"WELL, I NEVER KNEW
HE WAS TWO PEOPLE.

1096
00:53:33,300 --> 00:53:35,000
MAYBE NO ONE ELSE
WOULD FIND OUT."

1097
00:53:36,700 --> 00:53:39,600
EXCEPT I COULDN'T
FIND HIS STUPID CELLPHONE.

1098
00:53:43,700 --> 00:53:44,800
SO I LEFT
WITH THE ONE I HAD,

1099
00:53:44,800 --> 00:53:47,000
AND I THREW IT IN THE OCEAN
ON MY WAY HOME.

1100
00:53:48,700 --> 00:53:50,300
WHY DID YOU
KEEP ERIC'S CLOTHES?

1101
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:57,000
THEY'RE NICE.

1102
00:54:02,300 --> 00:54:03,600
HIS STUFF IS NICE.

1103
00:54:09,200 --> 00:54:10,800
I'M SORRY ABOUT THE GIRL.

1104
00:54:15,100 --> 00:54:17,100
SHE CAME DOWNSTAIRS
AND SAW ME.

1105
00:54:21,600 --> 00:54:23,600
I AM SO SORRY ABOUT HER.

1106
00:54:49,300 --> 00:54:51,100
Gabriel: SO, ON PAPER,
YOU TRANSFER EVERYONE

1107
00:54:51,100 --> 00:54:53,700
FROM PRIORITY HOMICIDE
TO THE COUNTERTERRORISM BUREAU.

1108
00:54:53,700 --> 00:54:56,400
WHOA, YOU GUYS DON'T HAVE
THE MANDATED TRAINING FOR THAT.

1109
00:54:57,300 --> 00:54:58,900
WELL, SEE, SIR,
THAT'S THE BEST PART.

1110
00:54:59,300 --> 00:55:01,200
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WILL
ACTUALLY PAY YOU

1111
00:55:01,200 --> 00:55:04,100
TO BRING US UP TO CODE,
THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS PER PERSON

1112
00:55:04,100 --> 00:55:06,500
WHICH YOU COULD ADD
TO YOUR BUDGET SHORTFALLS.

1113
00:55:14,300 --> 00:55:17,500
WELL...THAT'S...

1114
00:55:18,500 --> 00:55:19,700
THAT'S FANTASTIC.

1115
00:55:20,600 --> 00:55:22,800
SO, OFFICIALLY,
YOU WOULD ALL BE TRANSFERRED

1116
00:55:22,800 --> 00:55:24,500
TO THE
COUNTERTERRORISM BUREAU,

1117
00:55:24,500 --> 00:55:27,300
WHICH WOULD SATISFY THE STATE,
BUT IN ACTUALITY,

1118
00:55:27,300 --> 00:55:30,400
I COULD JUST LOAN YOU
RIGHT BACK TO PRIORITY HOMICIDE.

1119
00:55:30,400 --> 00:55:32,000
EXACTLY, 'CAUSE YOU ONLY
NEED MORE PEOPLE

1120
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:33,900
IN COUNTERTERRORISM
WHEN THE THREAT LEVEL GOES UP.

1121
00:55:33,900 --> 00:55:36,400
IF YOU WERE TO TRANSFER
THEM THERE PERMANENTLY --

1122
00:55:36,400 --> 00:55:38,800
I'M PAYING PEOPLE TO STAND AROUND MOST OF THE TIME.

1123
00:55:39,500 --> 00:55:40,400
YEAH, I HATE THAT.

1124
00:55:40,500 --> 00:55:41,100
YEAH.

1125
00:55:43,800 --> 00:55:45,200
YOU KNOW, SERGEANT,
FOR BUREAUCRATS,

1126
00:55:45,200 --> 00:55:48,500
THIS PLAN OF YOURS
IS THE EQUIVALENT

1127
00:55:48,500 --> 00:55:51,000
OF TURNING WATER
INTO WINE.

1128
00:55:52,500 --> 00:55:55,000
MY ONLY QUESTION IS,
WHY ARE YOU HERE SUGGESTING IT,

1129
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:56,500
INSTEAD OF CHIEF JOHNSON?

1130
00:55:57,700 --> 00:56:00,200
UH, WELL, SIR,
I THOUGHT

1131
00:56:00,500 --> 00:56:04,500
SHE MIGHT LIKE THIS IDEA BETTER
IF SHE THOUGHT IT WAS --

1132
00:56:04,500 --> 00:56:05,500
MY IDEA.

1133
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:09,100
UH-HUH, WELL, I SEE
YOU'VE WORKED OUT EVERY DETAIL,

1134
00:56:09,100 --> 00:56:11,100
INCLUDING
WHO SHE'S GOING TO BLAME.

1135
00:56:11,700 --> 00:56:13,100
THAT'S REAL GENIUS.

1136
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:15,400
ALL RIGHT, SAY I DO THIS.

1137
00:56:16,200 --> 00:56:18,300
YOUR CHIEF IS STILL SPENDING
LIKE A MADWOMAN.

1138
00:56:18,300 --> 00:56:20,100
NOW, IT'S NOT GOOD
FOR ONE DIVISION

1139
00:56:20,100 --> 00:56:22,400
TO HAVE EVERYTHING WHILE
EVERYONE ELSE IS CUTTING BACK.

1140
00:56:22,400 --> 00:56:25,000
I COMPLETELY AGREE, SIR,
AND I WILL DO EVERYTHING I CAN

1141
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:26,900
TO REMIND HER OF THAT
ALONG THE WAY.

1142
00:56:28,300 --> 00:56:29,200
HMM.

1143
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:33,600
IT'S VERY IMPRESSIVE,
SERGEANT.

1144
00:56:34,200 --> 00:56:37,800
IT'S, UH...
REALLY, IT'S VERY IMPRESSIVE.

1145
00:56:37,800 --> 00:56:39,300
THANK YOU, SIR.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.

1146
00:56:39,300 --> 00:56:40,500
THANK YOU.

1147
00:56:40,500 --> 00:56:41,300
I'LL JUST --

1148
00:56:41,300 --> 00:56:42,400
YEAH,
I'LL HANG ON TO THIS.

1149
00:56:42,400 --> 00:56:43,500
OKAY.
THANK YOU, SIR.

1150
00:56:54,700 --> 00:56:55,300
HEY.

1151
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:56,800
WHAT?

1152
00:57:04,500 --> 00:57:05,300
OH.

1153
00:57:13,500 --> 00:57:14,400
HEY.

1154
00:57:14,400 --> 00:57:15,500
Brenda: HEY.

1155
00:57:15,900 --> 00:57:17,900
YOU BROUGHT IN ALL YOUR STUFF
FROM THE GARAGE.

1156
00:57:17,900 --> 00:57:19,000
I DID.

1157
00:57:19,900 --> 00:57:21,100
COME SEE.

1158
00:57:21,900 --> 00:57:23,000
COME SEE.

1159
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:33,800
THERE'S A BARBECUE
IN THE BATHROOM.

1160
00:57:35,200 --> 00:57:38,300
UH, HONEY,
DO YOU THINK THAT MY BOOKS

1161
00:57:38,600 --> 00:57:41,500
WILL LOOK BETTER
IF I PUT THE SHELVING UP

1162
00:57:41,500 --> 00:57:45,300
AROUND THE CEILING IN HERE,
OR SHOULD I TRY THE KITCHEN?

1163
00:57:48,600 --> 00:57:50,300
ACTUALLY,
DON'T GO IN THERE YET.

1164
00:57:50,300 --> 00:57:52,100
THAT ROOM'S
STILL A LITTLE CROWDED.

1165
00:57:53,300 --> 00:57:54,100
OKAY.

1166
00:57:54,100 --> 00:57:56,200
OKAY. OKAY.

1167
00:57:56,500 --> 00:57:57,800
OKAY, YOU WIN.

1168
00:57:58,200 --> 00:58:00,400
I THINK WE SHOULD PUT
THIS LITTLE HOUSE ON THE MARKET

1169
00:58:00,400 --> 00:58:02,200
AND FIND SOMEPLACE ELSE
TO LIVE.

1170
00:58:02,200 --> 00:58:03,100
YOU SURE?

1171
00:58:03,600 --> 00:58:06,700
I ONLY WANT TO DO THIS
IF YOU'RE READY TO MOVE ON.

1172
00:58:06,800 --> 00:58:11,300
WELL, I -- HONESTLY,
I DO HATE CHANGE A LOT.

1173
00:58:11,300 --> 00:58:13,800
CHANGE IS --
IT'S JUST -- IT'S BAD.

1174
00:58:13,800 --> 00:58:14,600
BUT?

1175
00:58:15,600 --> 00:58:16,700
BUT, UM...

1176
00:58:19,200 --> 00:58:24,700
BUT I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT,
IN A RELATIONSHIP LIKE OURS,

1177
00:58:24,700 --> 00:58:28,600
TO KEEP ALL OF OUR STUFF
IN ONE PLACE.

1178
00:58:32,800 --> 00:58:33,900
THANK YOU.

1179
00:58:45,500 --> 00:58:47,500
DO I HAVE TO HELP YOU
PUT ALL THIS STUFF BACK?

1180
00:58:48,700 --> 00:58:51,000
OH, YEAH.
OH, ABSOLUTELY.

1181
00:58:57,800 --> 00:59:00,500
AH, MAYBE NOT TONIGHT.

1182
