1
00:03:15,895 --> 00:03:18,814
We should've talked
at the boatyard.

2
00:03:18,898 --> 00:03:21,150
You don't wanna
talk about it here.

3
00:03:21,234 --> 00:03:25,821
I'm not falling all over
myself to talk about
it much of anywhere, Jack.

4
00:03:25,905 --> 00:03:27,573
How much do you know?

5
00:03:27,657 --> 00:03:28,657
Not much.

6
00:03:33,454 --> 00:03:36,915
The Birmingham one
was in the papers
over a month ago.

7
00:03:38,376 --> 00:03:40,878
The second one in Atlanta
was all over TV.

8
00:03:41,713 --> 00:03:43,088
Did you ever think
about giving me a call?

9
00:03:43,173 --> 00:03:44,840
No.

10
00:03:44,924 --> 00:03:46,466
Why not?

11
00:03:46,551 --> 00:03:48,093
I quit. Remember?

12
00:03:53,016 --> 00:03:54,933
You look all right now.

13
00:03:57,020 --> 00:03:58,729
I am all right.

14
00:04:10,325 --> 00:04:14,536
If you can't
look anymore,
I understand.

15
00:04:15,622 --> 00:04:18,457
Don't try to run
a game down on me, Jack.

16
00:04:24,923 --> 00:04:28,301
If I really didn't need you
to come back, I wouldn't ask.

17
00:04:28,385 --> 00:04:29,844
This guy's on a lunar cycle.

18
00:04:29,929 --> 00:04:33,431
I have three weeks
and a few days until
the next full moon.

19
00:04:33,515 --> 00:04:38,353
We have a better chance
to get him fast if you help.

20
00:05:21,855 --> 00:05:23,648
I'll think about it.

21
00:05:24,566 --> 00:05:26,025
Stay and eat.

22
00:05:36,787 --> 00:05:38,162
Hi, Molly.

23
00:05:50,884 --> 00:05:52,260
Think it'll keep
them out, Dad?

24
00:05:52,344 --> 00:05:53,469
Yep.

25
00:05:55,889 --> 00:05:58,141
How many turtle eggs
do you think are in here?

26
00:05:58,225 --> 00:05:59,225
In this hatchery?

27
00:05:59,310 --> 00:06:01,561
I'll bet there's
40 or 50 of them.

28
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:05,481
Crabs get most
of the newborns, huh?

29
00:06:05,566 --> 00:06:07,358
Yeah, but not now.

30
00:06:07,443 --> 00:06:09,902
These are all gonna
make it, guaranteed.

31
00:06:13,532 --> 00:06:15,783
What about the dogs?
Are they gonna get in here?

32
00:06:15,868 --> 00:06:17,160
They can't dig under.

33
00:06:17,244 --> 00:06:20,038
That's why we bury
the wire down in the sand.

34
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:24,751
We need more staples, pal.

35
00:06:33,927 --> 00:06:35,345
You're supposed
to be his friend, Jack.

36
00:06:35,429 --> 00:06:38,556
Why didn't you
leave him alone?

37
00:06:39,933 --> 00:06:42,685
If he decides
to do it, Molly,

38
00:06:43,479 --> 00:06:46,440
I'll keep him
as far away
from it as I can.

39
00:07:02,332 --> 00:07:03,874
We got it pretty good,
don't we?

40
00:07:03,958 --> 00:07:06,043
We have it more than good.

41
00:07:06,878 --> 00:07:10,172
All that happened to you
before lets you know that.

42
00:07:13,259 --> 00:07:16,470
If I went back,
I'd only look at evidence.

43
00:07:17,806 --> 00:07:20,140
I wouldn't get
deeply involved.

44
00:07:20,642 --> 00:07:23,310
He'd never even
see me or know my name.

45
00:07:23,812 --> 00:07:27,356
If they find him,
they'll have to take
him down, not me.

46
00:07:31,069 --> 00:07:32,778
What do you think?

47
00:07:36,324 --> 00:07:40,077
I think you've already decided
and you're not really asking.

48
00:07:43,331 --> 00:07:44,998
If I were asking?

49
00:07:47,043 --> 00:07:49,044
Stay here with me,

50
00:07:49,504 --> 00:07:51,004
me and Kevin.

51
00:07:51,923 --> 00:07:54,299
But it's selfish,
and I know it.

52
00:08:00,432 --> 00:08:01,765
Come here.

53
00:09:00,283 --> 00:09:04,036
OFFICER: I'll come inside
with you, if you want,
to show you around.

54
00:09:14,590 --> 00:09:16,674
Mr. Crawford said maybe
you'd want to be alone, but...

55
00:09:16,759 --> 00:09:18,259
That's right.

56
00:09:20,095 --> 00:09:23,389
There's a VCR hooked up
in your hotel room.

57
00:09:24,558 --> 00:09:28,895
They transferred
some home movies of both
families onto half-inch VHS.

58
00:09:28,979 --> 00:09:30,230
Thanks.

59
00:11:14,168 --> 00:11:16,419
Intruder entered through
kitchen sliding door.

60
00:11:16,503 --> 00:11:19,213
Used a glass cutter
anchored to a suction cup.

61
00:11:19,298 --> 00:11:21,090
His entry was skillful.

62
00:11:22,843 --> 00:11:25,220
All the prints
are smooth gloves.

63
00:11:25,597 --> 00:11:29,433
Blond hair, strong,
size 12 shoe imprint.

64
00:11:31,186 --> 00:11:35,773
Blood AB positive,
typed from saliva on glass
from licking the suction cup.

65
00:11:36,691 --> 00:11:40,027
Why didn't he care that
he left saliva on the glass?

66
00:11:43,531 --> 00:11:46,367
It was hot out that night,

67
00:11:46,451 --> 00:11:49,578
so inside the house
must have felt cool to him.

68
00:11:53,833 --> 00:11:56,251
Intruder cut Charles Leeds'
throat as he was rising,

69
00:11:56,336 --> 00:11:58,337
then shot Mrs. Leeds.

70
00:11:58,421 --> 00:12:00,798
Bullet entered right
of her navel and lodged
in her lumbar spine,

71
00:12:00,882 --> 00:12:03,550
but she died
of strangulation.

72
00:12:03,635 --> 00:12:05,886
Moderate elevation
of serotonin
and marked increase

73
00:12:05,970 --> 00:12:07,388
of free histamine level
in gunshot wound

74
00:12:07,472 --> 00:12:11,392
indicates she lived
at least five minutes
after she was shot.

75
00:12:12,811 --> 00:12:15,396
All her other injuries
were post-mortem.

76
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:20,067
Direction and velocity
of bloodstains on east wall
indicate arterial spray.

77
00:12:20,610 --> 00:12:22,569
Even with his throat cut,
Leeds tried to fight

78
00:12:22,654 --> 00:12:26,115
because the intruder
was moving
to the children's room.

79
00:12:28,410 --> 00:12:30,327
Bloodstains on west wall
of master bedroom

80
00:12:30,412 --> 00:12:33,664
and matted sliding
marks on hall carpet
remain unexplained,

81
00:12:36,126 --> 00:12:39,336
as does superficial ligature
mark around Mr. Leeds' chest,

82
00:12:40,130 --> 00:12:42,506
also believed
to be post-mortem.

83
00:12:46,094 --> 00:12:49,555
What did the killer
do with them
after they were dead?

When they were dead,

94
00:14:12,181 --> 00:14:14,307
he smashed the mirrors
and began selecting pieces

that he would use
later on Mrs. Leeds.

God, she's lovely,
isn't she?

113
00:16:47,462 --> 00:16:51,840
It was maddening to have
to touch her with rubber
gloves on, wasn't it?

114
00:16:52,717 --> 00:16:55,135
They found talcum
powder on her leg,

115
00:16:55,220 --> 00:16:58,097
but there wasn't
any talcum powder
in the bathroom.

116
00:17:03,103 --> 00:17:04,687
The talcum powder came
out of a rubber glove

117
00:17:04,771 --> 00:17:07,231
as you pulled
it off to touch her.

118
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:12,152
You took off your gloves
to touch her, didn't you?

Didn't you,
you son of a bitch?

120
00:17:14,990 --> 00:17:16,657
You touched her
with your bare hands,

121
00:17:16,741 --> 00:17:19,201
and then you put
your gloves back on.

00:17:19,285 --> 00:17:22,079
But while your
gloves were off,

123
00:17:22,163 --> 00:17:25,582
did you open all their eyes
so that they could see you?

Is Price still
in Latent Prints?

Yeah, he's in charge

they dusted everything,

What do you want him to do?

135
00:18:01,036 --> 00:18:03,370
Dust Mrs. Leeds'
finger and toenails

136
00:18:03,455 --> 00:18:05,414
and the corneas
of all their eyes.

137
00:18:07,292 --> 00:18:09,293
I think he took
off his gloves.

138
00:18:13,298 --> 00:18:16,341
Our people swear
he wore surgeon's gloves
the whole time.

139
00:18:16,426 --> 00:18:18,427
They dusted everything.

140

Your report
didn't mention eyes.

141
00:18:21,347 --> 00:18:23,891
Why do you think
he took his gloves off?

The Smithsonian in Washington
reconstructed these

145

we took of the bite marks

00:27:38,491 --> 00:27:39,867
That's interesting.

315
00:27:39,951 --> 00:27:42,202
No, it's not.
You thought of it before.

316
00:27:42,287 --> 00:27:43,788
I considered it.

317
00:27:43,873 --> 00:27:47,167
You came here to look at me,
to get the old scent
back again, didn't you?

318
00:27:47,251 --> 00:27:48,501
I want your opinion.

319
00:27:48,586 --> 00:27:50,170
I don't have one right now.

320
00:27:50,254 --> 00:27:53,006
Well, when you have one,
I'd like to hear it.

321
00:27:53,090 --> 00:27:54,090
Can I keep this?

322
00:27:54,175 --> 00:27:55,175
I haven't decided yet.

323
00:27:55,259 --> 00:27:56,468
I'll study them.

324
00:27:56,552 --> 00:27:58,303
When you get more files,
I'd like to see them, too.

325
00:27:58,387 --> 00:28:01,806
You can call me.
When I have to call my lawyer,
they bring me a telephone.

No.

if you could pull it out

I don't see a Rolodex.

Ladies and gentlemen,

we are beginning our descent
into Birmingham.

393
00:36:34,447 --> 00:36:37,491
WILL: You used a cutting
tool on the branch
so that you could see.

394
00:36:37,576 --> 00:36:39,743
Then you passed
the time whittling

00:36:40,787 --> 00:36:42,496
and dreaming.

396

When night came,

397
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:49,753
you saw them pass by
their bright windows.

398
00:36:50,338 --> 00:36:52,756
Then you watched
the shades go down,

399
00:36:53,592 --> 00:36:56,343
then you saw the lights
go out, one by one.

400
00:36:56,845 --> 00:36:58,888
Then after a while,
you climbed down

401
00:36:58,972 --> 00:37:01,182
and you went in to them,
didn't you?

402
00:37:01,266 --> 00:37:02,350
Didn't you,
you son of a bitch?

Bowman in Documents

00:40:00,113 --> 00:40:01,989
get Graham back
here right now.

469
00:40:02,074 --> 00:40:04,033
Then call Documents
and tell them
to scramble a team.

470
00:40:04,117 --> 00:40:06,369
I want everybody moving
five minutes ago.
You understand?

471
00:40:06,453 --> 00:40:08,287
JACK: I have a Documents
team on its way to you

472
00:40:08,372 --> 00:40:09,747
by helicopter
to pick up the note.

473
00:40:09,831 --> 00:40:11,207
Listen, after we've
worked the note,

474
00:40:11,291 --> 00:40:12,625
I want to replace
it in Lecktor's cell.

475
00:40:12,709 --> 00:40:14,210
I don't want Lecktor to know
that we've found it,

476
00:40:14,294 --> 00:40:16,253
he might try to warn
the killer somehow.

477
00:40:16,338 --> 00:40:17,338
Where's Lecktor now?

478
00:40:17,422 --> 00:40:18,547
CHILTON: Holding cell.

479
00:40:18,632 --> 00:40:20,883
How long can you keep
him in there without
him getting suspicious?

480
00:40:20,967 --> 00:40:22,927
CHILTON: Three, four hours.

481
00:40:23,011 --> 00:40:25,054
Brian, we have a note
coming in on the flight,

482
00:40:25,138 --> 00:40:27,807
possibly from the Tooth Fairy,
number one priority.

483
00:40:27,891 --> 00:40:29,058
It has to go
to Hair and Fiber,

484
00:40:29,142 --> 00:40:30,393
Latent Prints,
and then Documents.

485
00:40:30,477 --> 00:40:32,353
Will Graham and I
will be walking it through.

486
00:41:11,685 --> 00:41:14,645
One hair, Graham.
Maybe half an inch.

487
00:41:16,148 --> 00:41:17,481
And a couple of blue grains.

488
00:41:17,566 --> 00:41:19,775
Work the hair.

489
00:41:19,860 --> 00:41:21,819
What do we have
for negative comparison?

490
00:41:21,903 --> 00:41:26,115
Hair from Lecktor's comb,
whiskers from Lecktor's
razor they let him use.

491
00:41:26,199 --> 00:41:28,784
This is hair from
the security guard.

492
00:41:50,725 --> 00:41:52,559
MAN: How many guys
handled this without gloves?

493
00:41:52,643 --> 00:41:54,436
The guard,
cleanup man, Lecktor.

494
00:41:54,520 --> 00:41:56,313
The cleanup man
scrubbing sinks

495
00:41:56,397 --> 00:41:59,399
probably had the oil
washed off his fingers.

496
00:41:59,817 --> 00:42:01,610
But the others...

497
00:42:01,777 --> 00:42:02,903
One smudge.

498
00:42:07,074 --> 00:42:08,074
Those aren't ridges.

499
00:42:08,159 --> 00:42:10,744
It's just the texture
of the paper.

500
00:42:10,828 --> 00:42:11,995
I can fume for a print,

501
00:42:12,079 --> 00:42:14,331
but can't guarantee
the iodine stains
would fade out.

502
00:42:14,415 --> 00:42:15,832
Ninhydrin?
Boost it with heat?

503
00:42:15,917 --> 00:42:16,958
No.

504
00:42:17,043 --> 00:42:19,294
We couldn't wash it after.

505
00:42:19,378 --> 00:42:22,255
I can't get a print off this
in the time you've got
to get it back, Will.

506
00:42:23,132 --> 00:42:24,174
BOWMAN: How long do I have?

507
00:42:24,258 --> 00:42:25,258
JACK: Twenty minutes, max.

508
00:42:25,343 --> 00:42:26,510
BOWMAN: The main thing
to find out is,

509
00:42:26,594 --> 00:42:28,970
how was Lecktor supposed
to reply to him?

510
00:42:29,055 --> 00:42:31,848
Which is probably
the missing section,
because at the top it says,

511
00:42:31,933 --> 00:42:35,060
"I hope we can correspond,"
then comes the gap.

512
00:42:37,271 --> 00:42:39,439
This note was written
in ballpoint,

513
00:42:40,024 --> 00:42:43,610
but it looks like Lecktor
went over this area
with a felt-tip pen,

514
00:42:44,153 --> 00:42:46,029
then tore it away.

515
00:43:14,475 --> 00:43:17,060
You're so sly,

516
00:43:17,144 --> 00:43:18,895
but so am I.

517
00:43:26,153 --> 00:43:30,865
The aniline dyes used
in the ink of the felt-tip
pens like Lecktor used

518
00:43:30,950 --> 00:43:33,118
are transparent to infrared.

519
00:43:33,202 --> 00:43:35,996
The Tooth Fairy's
ballpoint isn't.

520
00:43:43,921 --> 00:43:46,840
This looks like the tip
of a T here, here, and here.

521
00:43:47,216 --> 00:43:49,801
At the end is what
could be the top of an R.

522
00:43:50,386 --> 00:43:52,095
There's three Ts
and an R in "Tattler."

523
00:43:52,179 --> 00:43:53,263
We know our boy reads it.

524
00:43:53,347 --> 00:43:54,973
The article about me
and Lecktor.

525
00:43:55,057 --> 00:43:57,601
I don't know anybody else
that's carried that.

526
00:43:58,477 --> 00:43:59,769
Personal ads.

527
00:44:03,233 --> 00:44:06,110
We believe the Tooth Fairy
told Lecktor to reply to him

528
00:44:06,194 --> 00:44:09,071
through the personal
ad section of
the National Tattler.

529
00:44:09,156 --> 00:44:12,199
The Chicago office
is down there right now
running through their ads.

530
00:44:12,284 --> 00:44:14,452
We have cut into
a line of communication

531
00:44:14,536 --> 00:44:16,621
between the Tooth Fairy
and Lecktor.

532
00:44:16,705 --> 00:44:19,415
If we find Lecktor's
reply we plan to pull it,

533
00:44:19,499 --> 00:44:21,500
substitute it
with one of our own.

534
00:44:21,585 --> 00:44:24,378
And this is what
the Tooth Fairy
will read. Bill?

535
00:44:24,463 --> 00:44:28,382
"Dear Avid Fan,
inherit my mantle and surpass
my achievements.

536
00:44:28,467 --> 00:44:31,677
"Mementoes for you
at Baltimore Central
Left Luggage.

537
00:44:31,762 --> 00:44:33,888
"Ticket number 72683."

538
00:44:34,556 --> 00:44:36,599
It's a Secret Service
letter drop.

539
00:44:36,683 --> 00:44:37,808
We plan to stake it out.

540
00:44:37,893 --> 00:44:38,976
When he shows,
we'll grab him.

541
00:44:39,061 --> 00:44:40,811
Anything from Chicago?
SARAH: Not yet.

542
00:44:40,896 --> 00:44:42,813
When do they go to press?

543
00:44:42,898 --> 00:44:44,315
JACK: Thirty-five minutes.

544
00:44:44,399 --> 00:44:46,108
Christ.
Let's get to the physical.

545
00:44:46,193 --> 00:44:47,735
There was no print.

546
00:44:47,819 --> 00:44:49,570
Scale counts
and core size of the hair

547
00:44:49,655 --> 00:44:52,073
match the blond hair
found in the Jacobis'.

548
00:44:52,157 --> 00:44:54,575
That note was written
by your man.

549
00:44:55,410 --> 00:44:56,994
Aside from the hair,
three blue grains,

550
00:44:57,079 --> 00:44:58,954
dark flecks,
went to Brian's end.

551
00:44:59,039 --> 00:45:01,666
The grains are commercial
granulated cleanser
with chlorine,

552
00:45:01,750 --> 00:45:02,708
from the cleaning man.

553
00:45:02,793 --> 00:45:05,127
Several particles
of dried blood,
but not enough to type.

554
00:45:05,212 --> 00:45:06,754
(PHONE RINGING)

555
00:45:07,589 --> 00:45:09,382
OVER PHONE: This is Chester.
Who am I talking to?

556
00:45:09,466 --> 00:45:11,008
Will Graham, Jack Crawford.

557
00:45:11,093 --> 00:45:14,720
Got a personal ad with
"Avid Fan" in it being
telexed to you right now.

558
00:45:14,805 --> 00:45:16,764
Read it.
"Dear Avid Fan,

559
00:45:16,848 --> 00:45:18,474
"You honor me.
You're very beautiful."

560
00:45:18,558 --> 00:45:19,642
JACK: Oh, Christ.

561
00:45:19,726 --> 00:45:22,103
"I offer 100 prayers
for your safety.

562
00:45:22,688 --> 00:45:27,650
"Find help in Galatians
6: 11, 15:2,

563
00:45:27,734 --> 00:45:31,696
"Acts 3:3, Revelations 18:7,

564
00:45:32,614 --> 00:45:36,117
"Jonah 6:8, John 6:22,

565
00:45:36,743 --> 00:45:38,452
"Luke 1:7."

566
00:45:38,954 --> 00:45:40,204
JACK: Thanks.

567
00:45:46,503 --> 00:45:48,045
Jimmy.

568
00:45:48,130 --> 00:45:50,214
Did you get anywhere
at all identifying him
off the Leeds' prints?

569
00:45:50,298 --> 00:45:51,465
Not yet.

570
00:45:54,803 --> 00:45:56,345
Photography at Langley?

571
00:45:56,430 --> 00:45:58,973
They got shot a telex.
They're on it now.

572
00:46:12,988 --> 00:46:16,073
No. And our ad has to go
out in the same book
code Lecktor used,

573
00:46:16,158 --> 00:46:17,575
or he'll know
it wasn't Lecktor
talking to him.

574
00:46:17,659 --> 00:46:18,743
Book code?

575
00:46:18,827 --> 00:46:20,369
"100 prayers" could
be the page number,

576
00:46:20,454 --> 00:46:21,872
the paired numbers
could be line and letter.

577
00:46:21,956 --> 00:46:23,123
But what book?
JACK: Not the Bible?

578
00:46:23,207 --> 00:46:24,207
No.

579
00:46:24,292 --> 00:46:25,250
Galatians 15:2.

580
00:46:25,334 --> 00:46:26,835
Galatians only
has six chapters.

581
00:46:26,919 --> 00:46:27,919
The same with Jonah 6:8.

582
00:46:28,004 --> 00:46:29,588
Jonah only has
four chapters.

583
00:46:29,672 --> 00:46:31,673
Lecktor was not
using the Bible.

584
00:46:32,258 --> 00:46:34,843
Then the Tooth Fairy
probably named the book
in the part Lecktor tore out.

585
00:46:34,927 --> 00:46:36,344
Right.

586
00:46:37,013 --> 00:46:38,889
What about sweating Lecktor?

587
00:46:38,973 --> 00:46:41,016
They tried sodium amytal
on him three years ago
to find where

588
00:46:41,100 --> 00:46:42,350
he buried a Princeton student.

589
00:46:42,435 --> 00:46:43,810
He gave them a recipe
for potato chip dip.

590
00:46:43,895 --> 00:46:44,978
JACK: Wonderful.

591
00:46:46,314 --> 00:46:49,691
The Tooth Fairy would have
named a book he knew
Lecktor has access to.

592
00:46:49,776 --> 00:46:51,485
He'd know it from articles
he'd read about Lecktor.

593
00:46:51,569 --> 00:46:53,028
JACK: Willingham,
when he tossed his cell,

594
00:46:53,112 --> 00:46:54,988
took Polaroids so they can
get everything back in place.

595
00:46:55,072 --> 00:46:57,699
Have him meet me
with pictures
of Lecktor's books.

596
00:46:57,784 --> 00:46:59,618
JACK: Where?
BOWMAN: Library of Congress.

597
00:47:06,042 --> 00:47:08,126
Twenty-five minutes.
He won't make it in time.

598
00:47:08,211 --> 00:47:11,254
Lecktor's ad runs as is,
we decode it later.

599
00:47:11,339 --> 00:47:15,467
Or we pull it,
figure out the code
and run our own ad next week.

600
00:47:15,551 --> 00:47:16,510
And lose a week?

601
00:47:16,594 --> 00:47:17,636
We got 17 days till
the next full moon.

602
00:47:17,720 --> 00:47:21,389
And I don't like
Lecktor's ad running
without knowing what it says.

603
00:47:22,934 --> 00:47:24,726
It's your call, Will.

604
00:47:27,730 --> 00:47:28,897
Run it.

605
00:47:29,899 --> 00:47:33,944
And what if it encourages
the Tooth Fairy to do
something else beside write?

606
00:47:34,028 --> 00:47:36,279
We'll all feel sick
for a very long time.

607
00:47:36,364 --> 00:47:39,699
JACK: And if Bowman
still can't figure it out?

608
00:47:39,784 --> 00:47:42,327
Then we'll bait him
with something else
in next week's Tattler.

609
00:47:42,411 --> 00:47:43,912
JACK: What, for instance?

610
00:47:46,457 --> 00:47:47,582
Me.

611
00:47:49,418 --> 00:47:51,711
I don't think
that's a very good idea.

612
00:47:55,591 --> 00:47:56,925
Why not?

613
00:47:57,009 --> 00:47:58,343
Don't you think
we can provoke him?

614
00:47:58,427 --> 00:48:00,762
Maybe.
Maybe he can be provoked.

615
00:48:00,847 --> 00:48:02,430
What I was thinking
about is you.

616
00:48:04,308 --> 00:48:06,142
You're getting deeper
and deeper into this.

617
00:48:06,227 --> 00:48:07,727
Good night.

618
00:48:07,812 --> 00:48:08,812
Sidney.

619
00:48:08,896 --> 00:48:09,938
I'll talk to you.

620
00:48:12,149 --> 00:48:13,859
Last time you did that
you did a real good job

621
00:48:13,943 --> 00:48:16,236
of pushing yourself
all out of shape.

622
00:48:16,946 --> 00:48:19,447
You try it on again
or you go through
some big trauma,

623
00:48:19,532 --> 00:48:21,700
you could relapse,
my friend.

624
00:48:21,784 --> 00:48:23,910
Sidney,
don't worry about me.

625
00:48:23,995 --> 00:48:27,163
I'm working the evidence,
making moves. That's all.

626
00:48:28,499 --> 00:48:29,749
I'm fine.

627
00:48:32,295 --> 00:48:34,129
Bowman just struck out.

628
00:48:34,463 --> 00:48:36,590
It is not books
in Lecktor's cell.

629
00:48:37,258 --> 00:48:38,216
Price?

630
00:48:38,301 --> 00:48:39,634
He just heard.
It's a bust-out.

631
00:48:39,969 --> 00:48:42,221
As evidence, the Leeds print
will get us a conviction

632
00:48:42,306 --> 00:48:44,181
if we could ever
find the guy.

633
00:48:44,266 --> 00:48:47,518
But he must never
have been printed because
he is not in our index.

634
00:48:47,603 --> 00:48:50,104
We are not gonna
identify him off the print.

635
00:48:53,525 --> 00:48:55,276
I'll use Lounds.

636
00:48:56,236 --> 00:48:57,486
What for?

637
00:48:58,238 --> 00:49:00,489
Our boy doesn't
read the New York Times
literary supplement.

638
00:49:00,574 --> 00:49:02,575
He reads Lounds
in the Tattler.

639
00:49:08,457 --> 00:49:09,624
What else should we cover?

640
00:49:09,708 --> 00:49:12,585
He put the shorts
on Charles Leeds
after he was dead.

641
00:49:12,669 --> 00:49:16,172
I believe
he did this to make sure
we wouldn't think he was gay.

642
00:49:19,676 --> 00:49:22,011
He's molested
all of his male victims.

643
00:49:22,512 --> 00:49:25,431
He may be impotent
with members
of the opposite sex.

644
00:49:25,933 --> 00:49:28,059
Our forensic
psychologists
have projected,

645
00:49:28,143 --> 00:49:30,019
though I'm not sure,

646
00:49:30,103 --> 00:49:32,772
that he may have had sexual
relations with his mother.

647
00:49:32,856 --> 00:49:34,106
(LAUGHS)

648
00:49:38,737 --> 00:49:41,948
So, how long do you plan
to stay in Washington?

649
00:49:42,032 --> 00:49:43,449
Till we've taken
out the Tooth Fairy.

650
00:49:43,533 --> 00:49:45,701
LOUNDS: Can the Tattler rely
on getting the straight stuff
from you?

651
00:49:45,786 --> 00:49:46,786
Absolutely.

652
00:49:46,870 --> 00:49:49,413
How does working on this case
affect your sex life?

653
00:49:49,498 --> 00:49:52,959
Mine? It doesn't affect mine,
it affects yours.
Go fuck yourself.

654
00:49:53,043 --> 00:49:54,543
Look, pal of mine,
you're news.

655
00:49:54,628 --> 00:49:56,087
Shoot the pictures.

656
00:49:56,171 --> 00:49:57,880
All right, Symie,
let's shoot them.

657
00:49:57,965 --> 00:49:59,131
I'm in the shots
with Graham.

658
00:49:59,216 --> 00:50:00,800
What?
I'm in the shots with you.

659
00:50:00,884 --> 00:50:03,469
Come on, you want this
to look real or not?

660
00:50:05,681 --> 00:50:08,975
Make sure the theater sign
across the street is just
slightly out of focus.

661
00:50:09,059 --> 00:50:10,768
We want him to be able
to read it so he can find it,

662
00:50:10,852 --> 00:50:11,852
but we don't want
to look too obvious.

663
00:50:11,937 --> 00:50:15,106
You make sure that
I look excellent.
All right, shoot it.

664
00:50:16,942 --> 00:50:17,984
One more.

665

One more.
That's enough.

666
00:50:20,237 --> 00:50:22,863
Okay, Graham.
Hey, always nice, huh?

667

Let's have lunch,
call my service.

No.

used on the severed branch

673
00:50:44,886 --> 00:50:46,846
was a common bolt cutter.

674

Asian Studies at Langley.

The mark you found
on the tree?
Yeah?

676
00:50:51,643 --> 00:50:55,688
It's a Chinese character
considered a lucky sign
in gambling.

677
00:50:55,772 --> 00:50:58,858
That same character appears
on a Mah Jongg piece.

678
00:50:58,942 --> 00:51:01,987
It means "Red Dragon."
Mean anything to you?

00:51:04,991 --> 00:51:06,033
No.

680
00:51:09,120 --> 00:51:11,538
If he shows,
and he's smart,

681
00:51:11,622 --> 00:51:14,041
he'll approach you
from the front, pass, turn,

from behind.

anything at all?

to leave you alone
with me now?

in the Tattler, right?

844
01:05:06,296 --> 01:05:07,588
I wanted to talk
with him about it,

but he said he wanted
to bring it up to you,

to know to see about Mom?

is trying to kill us?

855

When are you
going to kill him?

856
01:05:50,131 --> 01:05:51,590
I'm not.

857
01:05:52,008 --> 01:05:53,884
It's only my job
to find him.

858
01:05:57,597 --> 01:05:59,598
Barry's mom had
this newspaper.

859
01:05:59,766 --> 01:06:02,184
It said you were
in a special hospital.

860
01:06:05,313 --> 01:06:07,481
Well, it was
a regular hospital,

861
01:06:07,857 --> 01:06:11,193
then I was transferred
into the psychiatric wing.

862
01:06:12,195 --> 01:06:14,571
That bothers you,
doesn't it?

863
01:06:15,365 --> 01:06:17,032
I don't know.

864
01:06:17,867 --> 01:06:21,244
Was it because
in the papers it said
it was this man Lecktor?

865
01:06:21,788 --> 01:06:23,038
Mmm-hmm.

866
01:06:23,706 --> 01:06:25,332
What happened?

867
01:06:26,250 --> 01:06:30,379
Well, Lecktor was attacking
college girls,
then he killed them.

868
01:06:31,506 --> 01:06:32,965
How?

869
01:06:34,759 --> 01:06:36,468
In bad ways.

870
01:06:38,930 --> 01:06:40,722
He was a psychiatrist.

871
01:06:41,391 --> 01:06:43,308
One of the girls
was his patient,

872
01:06:43,393 --> 01:06:45,310
and I went to talk
to him about her.

873
01:06:48,314 --> 01:06:52,317
I tried to build feelings
in my imagination
like the killer had

874
01:06:52,402 --> 01:06:55,112
so that I would know
why he did what he did,

875
01:06:55,196 --> 01:06:57,614
because that would
help me find him.

876
01:06:58,533 --> 01:07:00,659
When I was sitting
in Lecktor's office

877
01:07:00,743 --> 01:07:03,412
and I looked up,
I saw a book on his shelf.

878
01:07:03,496 --> 01:07:05,706
It had pictures of
war wounds in it.

879
01:07:06,833 --> 01:07:08,542
And I knew it was him.

880
01:07:10,128 --> 01:07:13,755
So I went to a pay phone
down the hall
to call the police

881
01:07:14,841 --> 01:07:17,092
and that's when
he attacked me.

882
01:07:21,598 --> 01:07:24,392
You and Mom
came to see me
in the hospital,

883
01:07:24,476 --> 01:07:26,102
and that helped a lot.

884
01:07:27,604 --> 01:07:30,106
But after my body got okay,

885
01:07:30,941 --> 01:07:34,277
I still had his thoughts
going around in my head.

886
01:07:36,572 --> 01:07:38,614
And I stopped
talking to people.

887
01:07:41,577 --> 01:07:45,413
And a doctor friend of mine,
a Dr. Bloom,
asked me to get some help.

888
01:07:45,873 --> 01:07:47,123
And I did.

889
01:07:47,833 --> 01:07:51,461
Then after a while
I felt better,
and I was okay again.

890
01:07:55,799 --> 01:07:58,551
And the way
he thought felt that bad?

891
01:07:59,845 --> 01:08:01,596
Kevin,

892
01:08:01,680 --> 01:08:04,974
they're the ugliest
thoughts in the world.

893
01:08:20,783 --> 01:08:22,992

coffee do you like?

Can you give me an idea
of the conditions?

942
01:13:42,314 --> 01:13:44,899
Shooting from
maybe eight feet.

943
01:13:44,983 --> 01:13:46,692
I can't use any lights.

Okay, what's being
photographed?

945
01:13:49,947 --> 01:13:52,073
The activities
of nocturnal animals.

946

When do you need it?

947
01:13:54,034 --> 01:13:55,076
Four days.

948
01:13:55,160 --> 01:13:57,662
Okay, let me stick
this in the black hole.

949
01:14:03,419 --> 01:14:06,963
1000-C infrared sensitive
has to be handled
in total darkness.

950
01:14:07,047 --> 01:14:09,132
Remember to be
very careful with it.

951
01:14:09,216 --> 01:14:12,635
But still,
it's easier to handle
than the 1200 series.

952
01:14:12,719 --> 01:14:14,637
It'll be fine.

straight by touch code.

Maybe Mr. Dollarhyde
can drive you home tonight.

No, that's okay.
I'll take care of myself.

change things around.

It would be because
I would like you to.

Okay, sure.
Let me get my stuff on.

967
01:14:55,805 --> 01:14:57,973
How did you come to Gateway?

968
01:14:58,057 --> 01:14:59,766
Oh, they had to hire
the handicapped

969
01:14:59,851 --> 01:15:04,062
to shape up their
employment practices
to get this defense contract.

you speak very well.

Although you avoid
fricatives and sibilants.

At the Riker Institute
for the Blind,

975
01:15:15,742 --> 01:15:19,661
I trained in therapy
for speech- and
hearing-impaired children.

go back to it someday.

want to talk, that's okay.

because you're very direct,
and I like that,

you have to say.

I want to know whether
you're smiling or frowning.

I should be quiet or not.

I didn't mean to offend you.

987
01:15:57,408 --> 01:15:59,117
On the way,
can I take you somewhere?

988
01:15:59,202 --> 01:16:00,285
Where?

989

you use the mirrors.

1100
01:27:09,919 --> 01:27:13,338
I didn't know you then,
but I think you probably did.

1101
01:27:13,422 --> 01:27:15,924
But it wasn't the act
that got you down, was it?

1102
01:27:16,008 --> 01:27:18,927
Didn't you really feel
so bad because killing
him felt so good?

1103
01:27:19,011 --> 01:27:21,012
And why shouldn't
it feel good?

1104
01:27:21,805 --> 01:27:25,225
It must feel good to God.
He does it all the time.

1105
01:27:26,477 --> 01:27:27,894
God's terrific.

1106
01:27:28,520 --> 01:27:30,730
He dropped a church roof
on 34 of his worshippers

1107
01:27:30,814 --> 01:27:32,398
last Wednesday night
in Texas

1108
01:27:32,483 --> 01:27:35,610
as they were groveling
through a hymn
to his majesty.

1109
01:27:35,986 --> 01:27:38,238
Don't you think
that felt good?

1110
01:27:42,326 --> 01:27:44,494
Why does it feel good,
Dr. Lecktor?

1111
01:27:45,621 --> 01:27:48,873
It feels good, Will,
because God has power.

1112
01:27:50,167 --> 01:27:53,378
And if one does what
God does enough times,

1113
01:27:53,712 --> 01:27:57,006
one will become as God is.

1114
01:28:01,679 --> 01:28:05,014
God's a champ.
He always stays ahead.

1115
01:28:05,516 --> 01:28:09,352
He got 140 Filipinos
in one plane crash last month.

1116
01:28:09,436 --> 01:28:12,355
Remember that earthquake
in Italy last spring?

1117
01:28:15,943 --> 01:28:17,278
WILL: I enter.

1118
01:28:21,199 --> 01:28:23,075
The glass cutter.

1119
01:28:23,159 --> 01:28:25,786
The piece of glass
I take out is mine.

1120
01:28:25,870 --> 01:28:27,538
The house is mine.

1121
01:28:36,965 --> 01:28:38,841
I walk up these stairs,

1122
01:28:39,884 --> 01:28:41,760
I pass the children's toys.

1123
01:28:42,929 --> 01:28:44,972
The children mean
nothing to me.

1124
01:28:45,890 --> 01:28:47,850
They were put
here to help me.

1125
01:28:52,063 --> 01:28:53,772
I move to the door.

1126
01:28:58,069 --> 01:28:59,903
I step into the room.

1127
01:29:04,451 --> 01:29:06,076
I see you there.

1128
01:29:09,581 --> 01:29:11,874
And I see me desired by you.

1129
01:29:14,419 --> 01:29:18,464
Accepted and loved

1130
01:29:19,507 --> 01:29:22,509
in the silver mirrors

1131
01:29:23,428 --> 01:29:24,928
of your eyes.

1134
01:30:02,467 --> 01:30:08,180
Father, look in my eyes

1135
01:30:08,473 --> 01:30:15,312
See me as I really am

1136
01:30:16,314 --> 01:30:19,316
You made me

1137
01:30:19,401 --> 01:30:22,694
Now take me

1138

RALPH: I'm gonna talk
to Fogel tomorrow...

1139
01:30:26,533 --> 01:30:31,745
Tell me how it feels now

1140

Behold your flesh
has come of age

1142
01:30:41,632 --> 01:30:48,555
Forsake me, you break me

01:31:11,370 --> 01:31:18,251
There's something about
this thing that taunts me

1151
01:31:20,713 --> 01:31:25,049
Mother, let me heal you

1152
01:31:25,843 --> 01:31:32,765
Your pain has lasted
far too long

1153

Release it, it kills you

What was it?

1155
01:31:44,361 --> 01:31:45,862
Pollen.
Oh.

1156
01:31:45,946 --> 01:31:47,322
Thanks for the ride.
See you tomorrow.

1157
01:31:47,406 --> 01:31:48,406
Yeah.

1158
01:31:50,117 --> 01:31:56,372

Oh.

Francis?
No,

1173
01:32:31,700 --> 01:32:33,284
not Francis.

1174
01:32:35,079 --> 01:32:36,496
Francis is gone.

1175
01:32:38,123 --> 01:32:40,458
Francis is gone forever.

1176
01:32:49,969 --> 01:32:51,553
So, what are we doing?

1177
01:32:52,388 --> 01:32:53,638
The dream.

1178
01:32:55,307 --> 01:32:58,018
He dreams about
being wanted and desired,

1179
01:32:58,478 --> 01:33:02,064
so he changes
people into beings
who want and desire him.

1180
01:33:02,732 --> 01:33:03,774
Changes?

1181
01:33:03,858 --> 01:33:05,317
It's a word.

1182
01:33:05,819 --> 01:33:08,821
Killing and arranging
the people to imitate it.

1183
01:33:10,532 --> 01:33:12,783
And Lecktor
told me something.

1184
01:33:12,867 --> 01:33:15,369
If one does what
God does enough times,

1185
01:33:15,453 --> 01:33:17,496
one will become as God is.

1186
01:33:18,331 --> 01:33:20,124
You put it together,
you get,

1187
01:33:20,208 --> 01:33:24,753
if our boy
imitates being wanted
and desired enough times,

1188
01:33:24,838 --> 01:33:26,714
he believes
he will become one

1189
01:33:26,798 --> 01:33:29,174
who is wanted
and desired and accepted.

1190
01:33:29,676 --> 01:33:31,510
It'll all come true.

1191
01:33:32,012 --> 01:33:34,930
This started
from an abused kid,

1192
01:33:35,181 --> 01:33:36,890
a battered infant.

1193
01:33:38,393 --> 01:33:40,936
There's something
terrible about...

1194
01:33:41,062 --> 01:33:43,689
JACK: What,
are you sympathizing
with this guy now?

1195
01:33:45,692 --> 01:33:47,443
Absolutely.

1196
01:33:47,527 --> 01:33:49,236
My heart bleeds
for him as a child.

1197
01:33:49,738 --> 01:33:52,364
Someone took a kid
and manufactured a monster.

1198
01:33:52,532 --> 01:33:55,868
At the same time,
as an adult,
he's irredeemable.

1199
01:33:56,578 --> 01:33:59,455
He butchers whole families
to pursue trivial fantasies.

1200
01:33:59,539 --> 01:34:03,584
As an adult, someone
should blow this sick
fuck out of his socks.

1201
01:34:08,214 --> 01:34:11,050
Do you think that's
a contradiction, Jack?

1202
01:34:12,260 --> 01:34:15,763
Does this kind
of understanding
make you uncomfortable?

1203
01:34:28,777 --> 01:34:30,569
What about the mirrors?

1204
01:34:32,947 --> 01:34:35,574
He uses the mirrors
to see it happen.

1205
01:34:37,577 --> 01:34:39,828
But he doesn't take anything.

1206
01:34:40,872 --> 01:34:42,498
There's no souvenirs
taken from the houses.

1207
01:34:42,582 --> 01:34:45,626
He needs souvenirs
or trophies
to re-live the event.

1208
01:34:50,006 --> 01:34:52,174
Maybe he records it somehow.

1209
01:34:53,426 --> 01:34:57,304
So he could see himself
accepted over
and over and over again.

1210
01:35:00,767 --> 01:35:03,352
VTRs, Polaroids,
stills, what?

1211
01:35:03,436 --> 01:35:04,895
How do I know?

1212
01:35:07,399 --> 01:35:09,191
How does he find them?

1213
01:35:10,735 --> 01:35:13,070
When we find out
how he found them,
we'll find him.

1214
01:35:13,154 --> 01:35:15,615
There is no connection
between the two families.

1215
01:35:15,700 --> 01:35:17,367
We've done a dozen
computer runs.

1216
01:35:17,451 --> 01:35:19,828
Jack, all the women
have a bloom on them.

1217
01:35:19,912 --> 01:35:22,247
He didn't win them
in a lottery,
he picked these women.

1218
01:35:22,331 --> 01:35:24,749
There's selection
and design in his choices.

1219
01:35:24,834 --> 01:35:27,502
Look, admit
we struck out
this month.

1220
01:35:27,586 --> 01:35:30,463
The Lear Jet is standing by,
the basic lab stuff is on it.

1221
01:35:30,548 --> 01:35:32,924
You, Zeller, Jimmy Price,
the photographer,

1222
01:35:33,008 --> 01:35:35,593
anywhere he hits,
we can be there
in an hour and 15 minutes.

1223
01:35:35,678 --> 01:35:38,722
We get the call, we roll.
The scene will be fresher
than we've ever had it.

1224
01:35:38,806 --> 01:35:40,265
It's not over yet.
For Christ's sake!

1225
01:35:40,349 --> 01:35:42,350
That's a foregone conclusion.

1226
01:35:42,435 --> 01:35:45,478
It's 11:30 p.m.,
the full moon
is happening tonight.

1227
01:35:45,813 --> 01:35:48,314
Give it up!
Forget this month,
it's too damn late!

1228
01:35:48,399 --> 01:35:49,899
I gave it up.

1229
01:35:49,984 --> 01:35:52,068
Till you showed up
with pictures
of two dead families,

1230
01:35:52,153 --> 01:35:55,613
knowing goddamn well that
I'd imagine families three,
four, five and six. Right?

1231
01:35:55,698 --> 01:35:57,574
You're fucking right I did,
and I'd do it again!

1232
01:35:57,658 --> 01:35:59,743
Great! But don't talk
to me about late, pal,

1233
01:35:59,827 --> 01:36:01,745
I'll tell you when
it's too fucking late!

1234
01:36:01,829 --> 01:36:04,789
Until then, we go as late
as I want to take it!

1235

(WILL SIGHS)

1236
01:36:23,517 --> 01:36:24,976
A padlock.

1237
01:36:31,358 --> 01:36:33,276
That's why the bolt cutter.

1238
01:36:33,903 --> 01:36:35,236
What's that?

1239
01:36:35,362 --> 01:36:36,946
He used a bolt cutter
to trim away the branch

1240
01:36:37,031 --> 01:36:38,698
when he was watching
from the woods.

1241
01:36:38,783 --> 01:36:40,950
Why didn't he use
the bolt cutter
on the garage door?

1242
01:36:41,035 --> 01:36:44,329
Because a deadbolt was there
when they were killed.

1243
01:36:47,875 --> 01:36:51,211
Donald Jacobi's
12th birthday party
was April 14th.

1244
01:36:51,712 --> 01:36:54,798
Sometime between
April 14th and August 1
they changed the lock.

1245
01:36:54,882 --> 01:36:57,342
But he thought there
was a padlock there.

1246
01:37:05,017 --> 01:37:08,895
From the street,
you can't see the glass
in the Leeds' kitchen door.

1247
01:37:08,979 --> 01:37:10,730
There's a big,
high fence there.

1248
01:37:10,815 --> 01:37:13,399
But he was ready
with his glass cutter.

1249
01:37:15,236 --> 01:37:18,238
So either he was
casing far ahead

1250
01:37:19,073 --> 01:37:22,242
and we didn't
check back far enough,

1251
01:37:24,286 --> 01:37:25,537
or...

1252
01:37:28,082 --> 01:37:29,082
JACK: We checked.

1253
01:37:29,166 --> 01:37:30,166
Don't talk.

1254
01:37:33,796 --> 01:37:37,424
Metcalfe, is the Leeds

01:54:44,542 --> 01:54:50,881
Sometimes I
understand it very clearly

1413
01:54:50,965 --> 01:54:56,136
Heartbeat, heartbeat
Listen to my heartbeat

1414
01:54:59,682 --> 01:55:01,391
How many of them made it?

1415
01:55:02,602 --> 01:55:03,810
Most of them.

1416
01:55:05,313 --> 01:55:07,480
Most of them made it.

1417
01:55:12,778 --> 01:55:18,658
Heartbeat
Listen to my heartbeat

1418
01:55:27,752 --> 01:55:30,670
I can hear your tiptoe

1419
01:55:31,380 --> 01:55:34,966
I can hear the door close

1420
01:55:35,051 --> 01:55:39,804
Anticipation in me grows

1421
01:55:42,350 --> 01:55:45,727
I can feel your dark eyes

1422
01:55:45,811 --> 01:55:49,022
Touch me in the darkness

1423
01:55:49,774 --> 01:55:53,485
Understand
the message never sent

1424
01:55:57,281 --> 01:56:03,787
Sometimes I

1425
01:56:04,538 --> 01:56:10,877
Sometimes I
understand it very clearly

1426
01:56:11,087 --> 01:56:30,606
Heartbeat, heartbeat

1431
01:57:06,184 --> 01:57:11,022
Anticipation in me grows

01:57:13,442 --> 01:57:16,986
I can feel your dark eyes

1433
01:57:17,070 --> 01:57:20,072
Touch me in the darkness
