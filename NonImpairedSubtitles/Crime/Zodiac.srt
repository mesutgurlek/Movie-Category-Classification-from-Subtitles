1
00:01:06,166 --> 00:01:08,430
Where have you been?
I've been waiting since 7:00.

2
00:01:08,535 --> 00:01:10,867
Get in. I had to find fireworks.

3
00:01:10,970 --> 00:01:12,164
Let me drive.

4
00:01:12,272 --> 00:01:14,536
Get in. I haven't eaten in 24 hours.

5
00:01:17,510 --> 00:01:19,068
Are you coming or not?

6
00:01:39,999 --> 00:01:41,899
It's too crowded.

7
00:01:42,001 --> 00:01:43,798
I thought you were starving.

8
00:01:45,605 --> 00:01:47,766
Let's go someplace quiet.

9
00:01:49,309 --> 00:01:50,469
Okay.

10
00:02:02,055 --> 00:02:03,682
What are we doing?

11
00:02:05,391 --> 00:02:09,589
Sitting. Listening to music. Talking.

12
00:02:10,663 --> 00:02:14,497
<i>- You seem weird. Is everything okay?
- Yeah, everything's fine.</i>

13
00:02:22,375 --> 00:02:25,071
It's July.
How many shirts are you wearing?

14
00:02:25,178 --> 00:02:28,272
- I'm cold.
- You're cold on the Fourth of July?

15
00:02:32,752 --> 00:02:34,811
Fuck off and die!

16
00:02:41,161 --> 00:02:44,255
- What?
- "Fuck off and die"?

17
00:02:45,899 --> 00:02:47,093
Shut up.

18
00:03:12,559 --> 00:03:14,652
Was that car at the drive-in?

19
00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:19,323
I saw that car at Mr. Ed's.

20
00:03:25,738 --> 00:03:29,003
- Do you want me to tell him to leave?
- Stay in the car.

21
00:03:44,324 --> 00:03:46,417
- Was that your husband?
- No.

22
00:03:50,697 --> 00:03:52,528
<i>Who was that, Darlene?</i>

23
00:03:53,466 --> 00:03:55,559
Don't worry about it.

24
00:03:55,668 --> 00:03:59,104
- Don't tell me not to worry. Who was it?
- It's nothing.

25
00:04:18,791 --> 00:04:20,281
<i>Oh, shit.</i>

26
00:04:23,663 --> 00:04:24,891
Let's go.

27
00:04:28,468 --> 00:04:29,662
<i>Now, D.</i>

28
00:04:41,981 --> 00:04:43,471
Get your wallet.

29
00:04:52,058 --> 00:04:54,026
<i>Man, you really creeped us out.</i>

30
00:05:56,622 --> 00:05:59,318
<i>- Vallejo Police Department.
- I want to report a double murder.</i>

31
00:05:59,425 --> 00:06:01,017
<i>May I have your name
and where you are calling...</i>

32
00:06:01,127 --> 00:06:03,493
<i>If you go one mile east
on Columbus Parkway,</i>

33
00:06:03,596 --> 00:06:06,827
<i>a public park,
you'll find kids in a brown car.</i>

34
00:06:07,767 --> 00:06:10,565
<i>They were shot with a 9mm Luger.</i>

35
00:06:11,537 --> 00:06:13,732
<i>I also killed those kids last year.</i>

36
00:06:14,874 --> 00:06:16,933
<i>Goodbye.</i>

37
00:06:34,927 --> 00:06:35,985
Spit.

38
00:06:36,829 --> 00:06:38,592
<i>Come on, buddy.</i>

39
00:06:38,698 --> 00:06:41,667
- I swallowed it.
- Why?

40
00:06:41,768 --> 00:06:43,133
It was minty.

41
00:06:44,170 --> 00:06:46,638
You can't do that. It's not good for you.

42
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:49,030
Lunch box.

43
00:06:49,142 --> 00:06:52,077
- Why am I not going on the bus?
- Because we're late.

44
00:06:54,046 --> 00:06:57,379
<i>Okay, you're staying
with your mom and Aaron tonight.</i>

45
00:06:58,017 --> 00:07:00,212
<i>So, you don't like
having a new little brother?</i>

46
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:03,652
<i>- No, not really.
- Oh, that's honest.</i>

47
00:07:05,658 --> 00:07:07,489
Learn a lot.

48
00:07:10,863 --> 00:07:12,728
There will be a test tonight!

49
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,092
Morning.

50
00:07:50,069 --> 00:07:52,037
- Hi.
- Good morning.

51
00:07:52,138 --> 00:07:53,469
- Morning.
- Morning.

52

<i>How's the coffee today, Shorty?</i>

53
00:09:02,942 --> 00:09:04,534
Editorial in two.

54
00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:35,666
<i>Good morning, gentlemen.</i>

55
00:09:35,775 --> 00:09:37,003

<i>Well, Stanton, tell Mr. Howe</i>

57
00:09:39,145 --> 00:09:41,636
the draft board piece

58
00:09:42,848 --> 00:09:44,315
Mr. Graysmith.

59
00:09:45,851 --> 00:09:47,250
Horrid.

60
00:09:47,353 --> 00:09:48,411
Horrid.

61
00:09:48,521 --> 00:09:50,716
Not so horrid.

62
00:09:50,823 --> 00:09:52,586
Horrid.
I'm thinking we go with not so horrid.

63
00:09:56,329 --> 00:09:58,957
<i>Paul, what's on the crime beat?</i>

64
00:09:59,065 --> 00:10:03,195
Janice in Datebook left the fondue party
before everyone got naked.

65
00:10:03,302 --> 00:10:04,997
That's a crime.

66
00:10:05,104 --> 00:10:07,231
Have you seen her? Wouldn't kid you.

67
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:10,070
It may be the beginning of a crime wave.

68
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:12,441
You need to see this.

69
00:10:17,850 --> 00:10:19,681

The murder weapons?

00:13:07,953 --> 00:13:10,854
<i>Ballistics, everything he said

He won't give his name.

148
00:13:56,936 --> 00:13:58,665
Morti's? Anyone?

149
00:13:58,771 --> 00:14:01,001
- That's where I'm heading.
- All right.

150
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:30,364
Put those on my desk. Turn on the light.

151
00:14:41,347 --> 00:14:42,871
Grab your book.

152
00:14:45,851 --> 00:14:47,910
Now go get your jammies on.

153
00:14:50,823 --> 00:14:52,313
<i>All right, people, listen up.</i>

154
00:14:52,725 --> 00:14:57,788
<i>The cipher's broken into three sections,
each with eight lines and 17 symbols.</i>

155

No breaks between the symbols
denoting different words.

No numbers or clues
to substitution keys.

And you got symbols
from at least seven different sources.

00:15:06,405 --> 00:15:11,035
<i>Greek, Morse code, Navy semaphore,
weather symbols, astrological signs.</i>

159
00:15:16,882 --> 00:15:20,045
<i>- Hey, take a gander at this code thing.
- Okay.</i>

160
00:15:25,391 --> 00:15:26,983
You wanna give it a go?

161
00:15:29,061 --> 00:15:32,030
Guy who used to sit there
was a great cartoonist. Bob Bastian.

162
00:15:32,131 --> 00:15:33,779
Now he's doing public television.
For some reason.

163
00:15:33,814 --> 00:15:35,427
Now he's doing public television.
For some reason.

164
00:15:37,002 --> 00:15:38,367
Paul Avery.

165
00:15:39,838 --> 00:15:42,807
Robert Graysmith.
I've been here nine months.

166
00:15:45,844 --> 00:15:48,108
<i>You were right, by the way.
He didn't give his name.</i>

167
00:15:48,213 --> 00:15:49,180
Who cracked it?

168
00:15:49,281 --> 00:15:51,511
A history teacher
and his wife in Salinas.

169
00:15:51,617 --> 00:15:54,711
"I like killing people
because it is so much fun.

170
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:58,847
"It is more fun
than killing wild game in the forest

171
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:03,486
"because man is the most
dangerous animal of all to kill.

172
00:16:03,595 --> 00:16:06,257
"Something gives me
the most thrilling experience.

173
00:16:06,365 --> 00:16:10,324
"It is even better
than getting your rocks off with a girl.

174
00:16:10,436 --> 00:16:14,065
<i>"The best part of it is that when I die,</i>

175
00:16:14,173 --> 00:16:17,142
"I will be reborn in paradise.

176
00:16:17,242 --> 00:16:20,609
"And all that I have killed
will become my slaves.

177
00:16:20,713 --> 00:16:24,479
"I will not give you my name
because you will try to slow down

178
00:16:24,583 --> 00:16:27,780
"or stop my collecting of slaves
for my afterlife. "

179
00:16:27,886 --> 00:16:29,751
Methinks our friend's
a tad bit fuckered in the head.

180
00:16:29,855 --> 00:16:34,019
<i>I heard he even sent Vallejo
a code key, just to help.</i>

181
00:16:34,126 --> 00:16:36,492
- What is that at the bottom?
- Leftovers.

182
00:16:36,595 --> 00:16:38,187
Maybe an anagram.

183
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:57,114
How does one do that?

184
00:16:57,950 --> 00:17:00,111
I like puzzles. I do them a lot.

185
00:17:01,487 --> 00:17:04,513
How did you know
he wasn't gonna give his name?

186
00:17:05,090 --> 00:17:06,717
Dangerous animal.

187
00:17:07,593 --> 00:17:09,185
Dangerous animal.

188
00:17:10,129 --> 00:17:12,996
What dangerous animal?
How do I know that?

189
00:17:20,372 --> 00:17:21,964
<i>- Paul.
- Yes, Templeton.</i>

190
00:17:22,074 --> 00:17:24,133
<i>- Editorial, now.
- Very well.</i>

191
00:17:26,311 --> 00:17:27,869
Another letter.

192
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:31,279
More of the same.
Details about the murders.

193
00:17:32,418 --> 00:17:36,320
He taped a flashlight to the gun.
That's how he hit them in the dark.

194
00:17:36,422 --> 00:17:38,481
And he gave himself a name.

195
00:17:59,645 --> 00:18:02,739
You know this used to be
the town of Montecello?

196
00:18:02,848 --> 00:18:04,179
<i>But at some point,</i>

197
00:18:04,283 --> 00:18:07,446
the county decided that the land
would work better as a lake.

198
00:18:07,553 --> 00:18:09,248
So they flooded it.

199
00:18:10,722 --> 00:18:14,488
- But there's an entire...
- Hidden city under the water.

200
00:18:14,593 --> 00:18:16,686
<i>We were here last spring, remember?</i>

201
00:18:16,795 --> 00:18:18,194
<i>Oh, yeah.</i>

202
00:18:24,403 --> 00:18:26,132
Somebody else is here.

203
00:18:26,238 --> 00:18:27,967
It is a public park.

204
00:18:30,642 --> 00:18:32,735
I think he's watching us.

205
00:18:32,845 --> 00:18:35,075
<i>Well, we're very good-looking.</i>

206
00:18:40,752 --> 00:18:42,219
Where'd he go?

207
00:18:44,957 --> 00:18:46,618
He went behind that tree.

208
00:18:46,725 --> 00:18:49,091
All right. So he's taking a leak.

209
00:18:56,101 --> 00:18:57,966
He's coming towards us.

210
00:19:00,072 --> 00:19:02,040
<i>Oh, my God, he has a gun.</i>

211
00:19:02,841 --> 00:19:04,308
Don't move.

212
00:19:04,409 --> 00:19:07,276
- I want your money and your car keys.
- Okay.

213
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:09,572
<i>We're not gonna do anything, okay?</i>

214
00:19:09,681 --> 00:19:13,378
We're gonna cooperate.
Just tell me what you want us to do.

215
00:19:17,055 --> 00:19:18,113
Here.

216
00:19:20,492 --> 00:19:22,983
You're welcome to everything I have.

217
00:19:26,565 --> 00:19:28,999
If there's anything else
I could do for you...

218
00:19:29,101 --> 00:19:31,399
Maybe I could write you a check?

219
00:19:33,972 --> 00:19:36,566
<i>Okay, I could give you
my phone number.</i>

220
00:19:37,176 --> 00:19:39,872
<i>You know, I might be able to help you.</i>

221
00:19:39,978 --> 00:19:42,071
Even more than you might think.

222
00:19:42,181 --> 00:19:44,240
He's a sociology major.

223
00:19:45,784 --> 00:19:48,378
<i>Pre-law, actually.</i>

224
00:19:50,522 --> 00:19:51,989
<i>Oh, keys.</i>

225
00:19:52,090 --> 00:19:54,217
<i>You know, I'm sorry, I don't know exactly
where I put my keys.</i>

226
00:19:54,326 --> 00:19:57,295
They might be on the blanket.
Is it okay if...

227
00:20:02,067 --> 00:20:03,625
Here's the keys.

228
00:20:05,103 --> 00:20:06,934
Don't get up.

229
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:09,030
I want her to tie you up.

230
00:20:13,212 --> 00:20:14,304
Okay.

231
00:20:34,066 --> 00:20:37,092
<i>You know, if he comes any closer,
I might be able to get that gun.</i>

232
00:20:37,202 --> 00:20:39,397
- Don't get any ideas.
- I'm not.

233
00:20:39,504 --> 00:20:42,098
I killed a guard
escaping from prison in Montana.

234
00:20:42,207 --> 00:20:44,175
<i>I'm not doing anything, okay?</i>

235
00:20:44,276 --> 00:20:46,437
I'm not afraid to kill again.

236
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:49,277
Look away.

237
00:20:56,555 --> 00:20:58,921
What was the name of that prison?

238
00:21:02,728 --> 00:21:05,288
<i>Hey, you said it was in Montana, right?</i>

239
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:08,092
I'm taking your car.

240
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:10,100
I'm going to Mexico.

241
00:21:10,202 --> 00:21:12,261
We didn't complain
when you tied our hands.

242
00:21:12,371 --> 00:21:14,339
<i>Okay, you have everything that I have.</i>

243
00:21:14,439 --> 00:21:17,272
We have done everything
that you've asked.

244
00:21:17,376 --> 00:21:18,707
It's okay. It's okay.

245
00:21:18,810 --> 00:21:21,074
<i>She tied you loose, didn't she?</i>

246
00:21:24,283 --> 00:21:26,342
Get on your stomach
so I can tie your feet.

247
00:21:26,451 --> 00:21:28,919
Okay.
It gets really cold out here at night.

248
00:21:29,021 --> 00:21:30,579
We could freeze.

249
00:21:38,997 --> 00:21:40,692
<i>Okay, you all done?</i>

250
00:21:42,734 --> 00:21:44,429
<i>You know,
just because people are gonna ask,</i>

251
00:21:44,536 --> 00:21:46,595
was that thing even loaded?

252
00:21:57,582 --> 00:21:58,879
It's okay.

253
00:21:59,618 --> 00:22:01,643
This is all gonna be okay.

254
00:22:30,649 --> 00:22:34,278
<i>Dispatch, this is 43L2,
heading south on Knoxville Road.</i>

255
00:22:34,386 --> 00:22:38,083
<i>I've got an abandoned white
VW Karmann-Ghia...</i>

256
00:22:52,170 --> 00:22:53,967
<i>Napa Police Department.</i>

257
00:22:54,072 --> 00:22:58,304
<i>I want to report a murder.
No, a double murder.</i>

258
00:22:59,845 --> 00:23:03,144
<i>They are two miles north
of park headquarters.</i>

259
00:23:03,248 --> 00:23:06,809
<i>They were in a white
Volkswagen Karmann-Ghia.</i>

260
00:23:08,387 --> 00:23:10,446
<i>I'm the one that did it.</i>

261
00:23:10,555 --> 00:23:12,614
<i>43L2 has a male victim with him.</i>

262
00:23:12,724 --> 00:23:15,318
<i>Piner's ambulance
has been dispatched.</i>

263
00:23:16,294 --> 00:23:18,455
<i>Boy lived, the girl didn't. Again.</i>

264
00:23:18,563 --> 00:23:20,929
<i>God, can you imagine
surviving something like that?</i>

265
00:23:21,032 --> 00:23:22,431
Writing the dates on the side of the car.

266
00:23:22,534 --> 00:23:25,628
<i>We got two Vallejo killings,
now there's one in Napa. Why Napa?</i>

267
00:23:25,737 --> 00:23:27,637
What the hell is he doing out of Vallejo?

268
00:23:27,739 --> 00:23:31,197
<i>Sweet mother of Christ,
what are you drawing?</i>

269
00:23:31,309 --> 00:23:32,799
Kid at the lake.

270
00:23:32,911 --> 00:23:34,708
This is what he said
the Zodiac was wearing.

271
00:23:34,813 --> 00:23:36,041
<i>God, that's a hell of a get-up.</i>

272
00:23:36,148 --> 00:23:38,742
<i>- Paul, what are you doing?
- Hyman, I wrote it. It's done.</i>

273
00:23:38,850 --> 00:23:39,908
Now I just got to type it up.

274
00:23:40,018 --> 00:23:42,145
Type it up?
It's not finished until you type it up.

275
00:23:42,254 --> 00:23:44,017
We've got to read it.

276
00:23:46,658 --> 00:23:49,456
- What's that?
- That's the Zodiac at the lake.

277
00:23:49,561 --> 00:23:50,994
What's the story with the kid?

278
00:23:51,096 --> 00:23:53,462
He seems a little touched
or medicated or...

279
00:23:53,565 --> 00:23:54,691
<i>- Graysmith?
- Yeah, what is it?</i>

280
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:56,290
He's a fucking boy scout.

281
00:23:56,401 --> 00:23:58,596
<i>He doesn't smoke,
he doesn't drink, he doesn't curse.</i>

282
00:23:58,703 --> 00:24:00,136
- And he's back.
- I knew it.

283
00:24:00,238 --> 00:24:01,569
"Man is the most
dangerous animal of all. "

284
00:24:01,673 --> 00:24:02,765
I knew that
I heard that from somewhere.

285
00:24:02,874 --> 00:24:05,172
<i>The Most Dangerous Game.</i>

286
00:24:05,277 --> 00:24:08,246
It's a movie about a Count
who hunts people for sport.

287
00:24:08,346 --> 00:24:09,370
People.

288
00:24:09,481 --> 00:24:11,449
<i>The Most Dangerous Game.</i>

289
00:24:12,217 --> 00:24:14,651
- Who's that?
- That's Count Zaroff.

290
00:24:14,753 --> 00:24:16,846
Zaroff? With a "Z"?

291
00:24:19,524 --> 00:24:21,253
<i>And that will be
all for the news on the 20.</i>

292
00:24:21,359 --> 00:24:23,850
<i>We've got curfews in effect tonight
for the following counties,</i>

293
00:24:23,962 --> 00:24:27,898
<i>Napa, Solano, Contra Costa,
Alameda, Marin, and San Mateo.</i>

294
00:24:27,999 --> 00:24:30,126
<i>So please, everyone, stay safe.</i>

295
00:24:30,235 --> 00:24:33,534
<i>Vic in San Francisco, you're on the line.
You're not scared of the Zodiac?</i>

296
00:24:33,638 --> 00:24:36,698
<i>Heck no,
he's only shooting those farm kids.</i>

297
00:24:36,808 --> 00:24:39,402
<i>What scares me
is those hippies out in the Haight</i>

298
00:24:39,511 --> 00:24:41,376
<i>with their free love and weird clothes.</i>

299
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:43,471
<i>We've got Alfred from Vacaville.</i>

300
00:24:43,582 --> 00:24:45,846
<i>You know, I think
that was really offensive.</i>

301
00:24:45,951 --> 00:24:47,578
<i>It's not just farm kids.</i>

302
00:24:47,686 --> 00:24:49,551
<i>These are nice, clean-cut young people.</i>

303
00:24:49,654 --> 00:24:52,088
<i>Hey, nobody's downplaying
the loss of human life here, Alfred.</i>

304
00:24:52,190 --> 00:24:54,181
<i>Well, that last guy was.</i>

305
00:24:54,292 --> 00:24:57,125
<i>We have good solid communities
out here in the North Bay.</i>

306
00:24:57,229 --> 00:25:00,756
<i>Unlike in the city where you have
Satanists running around.</i>

307
00:25:00,866 --> 00:25:04,324
<i>Well, you bring up a good question.
Is the Zodiac a Satanist?</i>

308
00:25:04,436 --> 00:25:06,131
<i>Amber from Oakland,
what do you think?</i>

309
00:25:06,238 --> 00:25:07,432
<i>I don't really know,</i>

310
00:25:07,539 --> 00:25:10,633
<i>but I thought that code
they printed didn't look very Christian.</i>

311
00:25:10,742 --> 00:25:13,438
<i>But I think the bigger problem
is that the papers shouldn't have printed</i>

312
00:25:13,545 --> 00:25:15,376
<i>anything that the Zodiac
has been doing.</i>

313
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:18,608
<i>That they're just printing
all that stuff to sell more newspapers.</i>

314
00:25:18,717 --> 00:25:20,878
<i>Well, the Zodiac did demand
they print his letters</i>

315
00:25:20,986 --> 00:25:22,578
<i>or he'd kill more people.</i>

316
00:25:22,687 --> 00:25:23,984
<i>Yeah, but he would have
done it anyway,</i>

317
00:25:24,089 --> 00:25:25,647
<i>whether they printed it or not, I think.</i>

318
00:25:25,757 --> 00:25:27,190
<i>An interesting point.</i>

319
00:25:27,292 --> 00:25:29,453
<i>So, what do you think he'll do next?</i>

320
00:25:50,181 --> 00:25:53,548
<i>- San Francisco Police Department.
- Yes. There's a fight in a cab!</i>

321
00:25:53,652 --> 00:25:54,880
<i>What is your location?</i>

322
00:25:54,986 --> 00:25:57,955
<i>3398 Washington,
at the corner of Cherry.</i>

323
00:25:58,056 --> 00:25:59,785
<i>One's drunk and
we think he's robbing him.</i>

324
00:25:59,891 --> 00:26:03,224
<i>- Is the crime still in progress?
- Yes, please hurry.</i>

325
00:26:04,729 --> 00:26:06,321
<i>Oh, my God, look!</i>

326
00:26:29,220 --> 00:26:30,448
Nuts!

327
00:26:33,758 --> 00:26:35,555
<i>Whoever this is,
you owe me a new lamp.</i>

328
00:26:35,660 --> 00:26:38,288
<i>Cabbie's been shot
three blocks from the Presidio.</i>

329
00:26:38,396 --> 00:26:40,591
<i>Well, it wasn't me.
I've been with my bride all night.</i>

330
00:26:40,699 --> 00:26:43,668
- She can vouch.
- Go put on the Folgers.

331
00:26:43,768 --> 00:26:45,167
<i>You'll pick me up?</i>

332
00:26:45,270 --> 00:26:47,101
Let me just describe
the lamp you're gonna buy me.

333
00:26:55,947 --> 00:26:58,882
<i>- I just got to sleep.
- Suspect's Negro, male adult.</i>

334
00:26:58,984 --> 00:27:01,885
<i>Walt's on scene, locked up the cab
and secured the crowd.</i>

335
00:27:01,987 --> 00:27:04,478
<i>Seriously, dead asleep.
I lost feeling in my arm and everything.</i>

336
00:27:04,589 --> 00:27:05,886
Crackers.

337
00:27:09,761 --> 00:27:11,752
You ever try Japanese food?

338
00:27:11,863 --> 00:27:14,525
<i>- What do you mean, like teriyaki?
- No, like the urchin.</i>

339
00:27:14,633 --> 00:27:16,999
<i>- Raw fish.
- I'm eating here, Bill.</i>

340
00:27:18,370 --> 00:27:21,339
<i>- I always wanted to try it.
- So, why don't you?</i>

341
00:27:21,439 --> 00:27:23,407
Haven't got around to it.

342
00:27:39,024 --> 00:27:42,152
<i>Evening, gents. What a lovely night
for a botched robbery.</i>

343
00:27:42,260 --> 00:27:44,820
<i>Yeah, third this week.
Must be end of summer rush.</i>

344
00:27:44,929 --> 00:27:48,057
<i>I got foot patrols going through the park,
dogs are on the way.</i>

345
00:27:48,166 --> 00:27:52,466
The victim's name is Paul Stine.
Dousette pronounced him at 10:10.

346
00:27:52,570 --> 00:27:54,663
Suspect fired one shot
to the back of the head.

347
00:27:54,773 --> 00:27:56,673
Driver's wallet
and car keys are missing.

348
00:27:56,775 --> 00:27:57,799
How'd you know his name?

349
00:27:57,909 --> 00:28:00,844
<i>Leroy, there, came down
from Yellow Cab to ID him.</i>

350
00:28:00,945 --> 00:28:02,503
<i>Neighborhood's pretty high-end
for this kind of thing,</i>

351
00:28:02,614 --> 00:28:04,809
so I already set up transpo for the cab.

352
00:28:04,916 --> 00:28:06,383
- Coroner's here.
- Any witnesses?

353
00:28:06,484 --> 00:28:09,920
Kids who called it in
saw the suspect from that window.

354
00:28:10,021 --> 00:28:11,511
- Did they hear a shot?
- No.

355
00:28:11,623 --> 00:28:12,715
<i>They first saw him in the front seat,</i>

356
00:28:12,824 --> 00:28:14,724
thought he was a drunk
fighting with the driver.

357
00:28:14,826 --> 00:28:17,795
<i>Oldest kid ran downstairs to get
a better look from the dining room,</i>

358
00:28:17,896 --> 00:28:19,693
<i>described him as a white male, glasses,</i>

359
00:28:19,798 --> 00:28:21,993
<i>crew-cut, stocky,
and wearing a dark jacket.</i>

360
00:28:22,100 --> 00:28:23,897
<i>Wait, I thought someone said
he was black.</i>

361
00:28:24,002 --> 00:28:25,902
That's the description
that went out to radio cars.

362
00:28:26,004 --> 00:28:28,939
<i>- We already corrected it.
- Oh, well, that's good.</i>

363
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:31,406
- You guys need anything else?
- No. Get out of here.

364
00:28:31,509 --> 00:28:33,443
Thanks. Happy Birthday.

365
00:28:33,545 --> 00:28:36,241
<i>- Wait, it's your birthday?
- Yep.</i>

366
00:28:36,347 --> 00:28:38,474
- That's great. Happy birthday.
- Thanks.

367
00:28:38,583 --> 00:28:41,575
<i>- Body or scene?
- It's your birthday, I'll take the body.</i>

368
00:28:41,686 --> 00:28:43,813
<i>Dave, looks like he
wiped the cab down pretty good.</i>

369
00:28:43,922 --> 00:28:46,322
- We got some blood over here.
- Prints?

370
00:28:46,424 --> 00:28:48,289
Could very well be.
We'll dust it at the Hall.

371
00:28:48,393 --> 00:28:51,123
<i>The odd thing is, we also got gloves.</i>

372
00:28:51,229 --> 00:28:53,629
- Suspect's?
- There's blood on them.

373
00:28:55,066 --> 00:28:56,260
<i>- Hey, Pete?
- Yeah, Dave.</i>

374
00:28:56,367 --> 00:28:57,527
<i>You through over there,
can I get in there?</i>

375
00:28:57,635 --> 00:28:59,262
<i>Yeah, I'm all set.</i>

376
00:29:00,238 --> 00:29:02,229
- Who rolled him?
- Stewarts.

377
00:29:09,147 --> 00:29:11,138
I got a single 9mm casing.

378
00:29:15,653 --> 00:29:17,018
<i>Yeah, Luger.</i>

379
00:29:17,622 --> 00:29:19,453
Nothing from the crowd.

380
00:29:19,557 --> 00:29:22,424
<i>Okay.
I'm your shooter, Negro male adult,</i>

381
00:29:22,527 --> 00:29:25,860
<i>who also happens to be
a stocky, crew-cut Caucasian.</i>

382
00:29:25,964 --> 00:29:28,489
I flag a cab. I give him this address.

383
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:31,364
Did I give him this address?
Who's got the fare book?

384
00:29:31,469 --> 00:29:32,800
Right here.

385
00:29:35,140 --> 00:29:38,007
Washington and Maple.
That's one block east.

386
00:29:59,130 --> 00:30:00,290
<i>Lighting's the same over here,</i>

387
00:30:00,398 --> 00:30:02,832
so maybe I see
someone walking their dog.

388
00:30:02,934 --> 00:30:05,767
You don't want any witnesses
so you tell him to go down a block.

389
00:30:05,870 --> 00:30:06,928
He pulls over.

390
00:30:07,038 --> 00:30:08,972
I wait for him to put it in park
because I'm smart

391
00:30:09,073 --> 00:30:10,370
and I don't want him
hitting the accelerator

392
00:30:10,475 --> 00:30:11,737
when I shoot him. May I?

393
00:30:11,843 --> 00:30:14,209
<i>He stops, puts it in park, boom.</i>

394
00:30:14,312 --> 00:30:17,008
<i>I shoot him on the right side,
he slumps right?</i>

395
00:30:17,115 --> 00:30:19,106
Maybe you've got your hand
on his collar when you shoot.

396
00:30:19,217 --> 00:30:20,377
<i>All right. So, either way,</i>

397
00:30:20,485 --> 00:30:22,180
I just dumped a quart of blood
in the front seat.

398
00:30:22,287 --> 00:30:25,415
<i>- So, why do you get in the front seat?
- For the money.</i>

399
00:30:25,523 --> 00:30:26,547
But he's dead.

400
00:30:26,658 --> 00:30:28,353
<i>You could just reach over the seat,
pull out his wallet.</i>

401
00:30:28,459 --> 00:30:30,620
You don't have to go
anywhere near the blood.

402
00:30:30,728 --> 00:30:33,196
<i>So, why'd he get in the front seat?</i>

403
00:30:33,731 --> 00:30:35,323
- I'm an idiot.
- But you're not an idiot.

404
00:30:35,433 --> 00:30:37,162
You waited for him to put it in park.

405
00:30:37,268 --> 00:30:39,463
<i>- Right. Thank you.
- Yeah, sure.</i>

406
00:30:41,206 --> 00:30:43,037
- Can I see that?
- Yeah.

407
00:30:43,575 --> 00:30:46,840
I am an idiot.
I just killed a man for $8.25.

408
00:30:46,945 --> 00:30:51,245
It's his third fare of the night.
Does anyone have any animal crackers?

409
00:30:51,783 --> 00:30:53,978
- Animal crackers?
- They're in the car.

410
00:30:54,085 --> 00:30:56,280
I'm saving those for later.

411
00:30:56,387 --> 00:30:57,547
Fine.

412
00:31:02,026 --> 00:31:05,723
<i>- Are you a reporter?
- No, I'm Inspector Dave Toschi, SFPD.</i>

413
00:31:05,830 --> 00:31:08,355
<i>Sir, I was wondering
if I'd be able to talk to your children,</i>

414
00:31:08,466 --> 00:31:10,696
one at a time and preferably alone?

415
00:31:10,802 --> 00:31:13,066
They just saw a man murdered.

416
00:31:13,171 --> 00:31:14,263
I understand.

417
00:31:14,639 --> 00:31:16,300
It looked like
they were drunk and fighting.

418
00:31:16,407 --> 00:31:17,704
<i>Yeah, and he had a rag.</i>

419
00:31:17,809 --> 00:31:20,175
He came around the side of the car
and he was wiping stuff.

420
00:31:20,278 --> 00:31:23,611
- Did you get a chance to see his face?
- I did.

421
00:31:23,715 --> 00:31:25,205
<i>Well, sort of.</i>

422
00:31:26,484 --> 00:31:28,975
Did you remember what he looked like?

423
00:31:30,488 --> 00:31:32,479
- Normal.
- Yeah.

424
00:31:32,590 --> 00:31:33,887
"Normal?"

425
00:31:56,614 --> 00:31:58,172
<i>"This is the Zodiac speaking.</i>

426
00:31:58,283 --> 00:32:00,649
<i>"I am the murderer of the taxi driver</i>

427
00:32:00,752 --> 00:32:04,188
"over by Washington Street
and Maple Street last night.

428
00:32:04,289 --> 00:32:06,723
<i>"To prove this, here is
a blood-stained piece of his shirt.</i>

429
00:32:06,824 --> 00:32:11,761
"I am the same man who did in
the people in the North Bay Area.

430
00:32:11,863 --> 00:32:14,423
"The S.F. Police could have
caught me last night

431

"instead of holding road races
with their motorcicles. "

433
00:32:19,537 --> 00:32:21,027
- Gentlemen.
- Dave.

434
00:32:21,139 --> 00:32:23,073
Paul. Where's the shirt?

435
00:32:24,509 --> 00:32:26,170
<i>Right there, boss.</i>

436
00:32:27,312 --> 00:32:28,870
There's your rag the kids talked about.

437
00:32:28,980 --> 00:32:30,971
So he got in the front seat
to tear off a piece of the shirt.

438
00:32:31,082 --> 00:32:33,482
<i>- Is this on the record?
- Well, what do you think?</i>

439
00:32:33,584 --> 00:32:35,609
He confirms
the Vallejo and Napa killings.

440
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:37,278
Gets worse.

441
00:32:37,388 --> 00:32:39,413
<i>Robert, do you have a deadline?</i>

442
00:32:39,524 --> 00:32:41,651
<i>What does he mean, it gets worse?</i>

443
00:32:41,759 --> 00:32:43,158
Read the last part.

444
00:32:43,261 --> 00:32:45,491
"School children make nice targets.

- All right.

450
00:32:56,908 --> 00:32:59,172
I'm gonna need elimination prints

get the letters up to Sherwood

- Hey, hey, come on.</i>

459
00:33:23,334 --> 00:33:25,564
<i>Hey, it's me.</i>

460
00:33:25,670 --> 00:33:27,763
Did he say they got a print?

461
00:33:28,873 --> 00:33:30,067
Partial.

462
00:33:31,075 --> 00:33:32,133
Whoa.

463
00:33:33,511 --> 00:33:34,876
<i>Dude, he wears his gun like Bullitt.</i>

464
00:33:34,979 --> 00:33:37,470
<i>No, McQueen got that from Toschi.</i>

465
00:33:37,582 --> 00:33:39,345
Does he think that Zodiac's
gonna send another code?

466
00:33:39,450 --> 00:33:41,247
'Cause I think Zodiac's
gonna send another code.

467
00:33:41,352 --> 00:33:43,377
<i>Jesus Harold Christ
on rubber crutches, Bobby.</i>

468
00:33:43,488 --> 00:33:44,512
What are you doing?

469
00:33:44,622 --> 00:33:45,919
<i>You're doing that thing,
the thing we discussed,</i>

470
00:33:46,024 --> 00:33:48,515
the thing that I don't like.
Starts with an "L."

471
00:33:48,626 --> 00:33:50,526
<i>- Oh, looming.
- Yeah.</i>

472
00:33:50,628 --> 00:33:53,529
<i>In cooperation with SFPD,
we will run the Zodiac letter</i>

473
00:33:53,631 --> 00:33:56,293
without including the threat
on school children.

474
00:33:56,401 --> 00:33:58,062
We don't want to start a city-wide panic

475
00:33:58,169 --> 00:34:01,661
so I'm asking all of you
to please keep this confidential.

476
00:34:01,773 --> 00:34:03,968
Just go about your daily business.

477
00:34:04,075 --> 00:34:05,406
Thank you.

478
00:34:21,125 --> 00:34:24,117
<i>I packed you your carrots
and your soda and peanut butter, okay?</i>

479
00:34:24,228 --> 00:34:27,220
<i>- Dad, you don't have to wait with me.
- I know.</i>

480
00:34:34,572 --> 00:34:38,372
<i>You know what? You know what?
I'm gonna drive him today, okay?</i>

481
00:34:38,876 --> 00:34:40,070
Come on.

482
00:34:58,129 --> 00:34:59,790
What's that?

483
00:34:59,897 --> 00:35:02,422
Similarities in the lowercase "r's. "

484
00:35:11,609 --> 00:35:12,735
And that?

485
00:35:12,844 --> 00:35:14,812
It is you waiting in the hall
if you speak again.

486
00:35:14,912 --> 00:35:16,743
I have to concentrate.

487
00:35:17,148 --> 00:35:18,240
Sorry.

488
00:35:18,349 --> 00:35:20,476
"Sorry" counts as speaking.

489
00:35:31,229 --> 00:35:34,198
There are similarities
in the lowercase "r's. "

490
00:35:38,269 --> 00:35:40,703
We have to release the bus threat.

491
00:35:41,305 --> 00:35:43,933
- It'll screw us.
- We're already screwed.

492
00:35:44,041 --> 00:35:46,271
We just went from
"Routine Cabbie Shooting"

493
00:35:46,377 --> 00:35:48,538
to "Mass Murderer Targets Kids. "

494
00:35:56,354 --> 00:35:59,414
<i>The Zodiac Killer
has come to San Francisco.</i>

495
00:35:59,524 --> 00:36:00,513
<i>Confirmation tonight,</i>

496
00:36:00,625 --> 00:36:02,559
<i>from the San Francisco
Police Department</i>

497
00:36:02,660 --> 00:36:04,594
<i>that in his latest haunting letter,</i>

498
00:36:04,695 --> 00:36:07,892
<i>which takes credit for the murder
of cab driver Paul Stine,</i>

499
00:36:07,999 --> 00:36:11,366
<i>the Zodiac has threatened to,
"Wipe out a school bus</i>

500
00:36:11,469 --> 00:36:14,802
<i>"and pick off the kiddies
as they come bouncing out. "</i>

501
00:36:18,276 --> 00:36:20,938
<i>If you think you might know
who the Zodiac is,</i>

502
00:36:21,045 --> 00:36:25,175
<i>you can call the San Francisco
Police Department's newest tip line.</i>

503
00:36:48,339 --> 00:36:51,570
Press conference is at 4:00.
We got to give them something.

504
00:36:51,676 --> 00:36:53,109
<i>We're coordinating
with the school board,</i>

505
00:36:53,211 --> 00:36:55,076
and we expect
a break in the case very soon.

506
00:36:55,179 --> 00:36:56,942
- What do we really got?
- We're swamped.

507
00:36:57,048 --> 00:36:58,413
When they can't get anyone
on the tip line

508
00:36:58,516 --> 00:37:00,211
they call the switchboard
and keep getting put through.

509
00:37:00,318 --> 00:37:01,307
You got any hard suspects?

510
00:37:01,419 --> 00:37:04,115
About 90 an hour. I'm up to around 500.

511
00:37:04,222 --> 00:37:05,348
<i>Well, can't you narrow it down?</i>

512
00:37:05,456 --> 00:37:07,617
<i>I would love to,
if I could get out of this...</i>

513
00:37:07,725 --> 00:37:11,217
<i>- Homicide, please hold.
- Yeah, hold, please.</i>

514
00:37:11,329 --> 00:37:13,024
We're gonna need to tell them
we got the entire force on this.

515
00:37:13,130 --> 00:37:14,427
How many men can you give me?

516
00:37:14,532 --> 00:37:16,523
<i>Well, right now, it's you and Bill
and Monday's a school day.</i>

517
00:37:16,634 --> 00:37:18,534
<i>Yeah, I know, Chief.
I have three daughters of my own.</i>

518
00:37:18,636 --> 00:37:20,570
<i>Yeah, I know. Where's Armstrong?</i>

519
00:37:20,671 --> 00:37:22,138
He's on the phone with Vallejo.

520
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:24,174
<i>We're playing catch up, Jack.</i>

521
00:37:24,275 --> 00:37:26,766
<i>I'd like to set up a meeting
with your survivor, Michael Mageau.</i>

522
00:37:26,877 --> 00:37:28,469
I can't. He skipped town.

523
00:37:28,579 --> 00:37:31,207
The only guy who's seen Zodiac
without a mask is missing?

524
00:37:31,315 --> 00:37:34,443
When he was still in the hospital
we could show him lineups all day long.

525
00:37:34,552 --> 00:37:35,951
<i>As soon as he got out, he split.</i>

526
00:37:36,053 --> 00:37:37,077
<i>Really? Why?</i>

527
00:37:37,188 --> 00:37:39,383
I don't think he wanted
to have anything to do with this.

528
00:37:39,490 --> 00:37:41,651
<i>Can you send us everything
that you have?</i>

529
00:37:41,759 --> 00:37:44,489
<i>Well, the road goes both ways.</i>

530
00:37:44,595 --> 00:37:47,723
<i>Now, we need that print
you lifted from the cab</i>

531
00:37:47,832 --> 00:37:49,766
<i>and we should have been in
on the handwriting.</i>

532
00:37:49,867 --> 00:37:52,131
I apologize.
Things have been moving fast.

533
00:37:52,236 --> 00:37:54,966
<i>Who should I talk to in Napa
so we can coordinate?</i>

534
00:37:55,072 --> 00:37:56,198
Talk to Ken Narlow.

535
00:37:56,307 --> 00:37:58,172
We really should have been in
on the handwriting.

536
00:37:58,276 --> 00:38:00,744
<i>I apologize.
Things have been moving fast.</i>

537
00:38:00,845 --> 00:38:02,278
<i>Listen, we're gonna need
your scene photos.</i>

538
00:38:02,380 --> 00:38:03,404
Can't help you.

539
00:38:03,514 --> 00:38:05,448
<i>Ken, I don't want to get into
a jurisdictional thing here.</i>

540
00:38:05,549 --> 00:38:08,143
<i>No, no, no, no, no.
We didn't have a crime scene.</i>

541
00:38:08,252 --> 00:38:11,483
The ranger that found the kids literally
swept everything into a picnic blanket.

542
00:38:11,589 --> 00:38:13,284
<i>All we have are the Wing Walker prints.</i>

543
00:38:13,391 --> 00:38:14,483
The what?

544
00:38:14,592 --> 00:38:16,287
Boot prints to and from the crime scene

545
00:38:16,394 --> 00:38:17,986
<i>were made by size
10-and-a-half Wing Walkers,</i>

546
00:38:18,095 --> 00:38:21,553
military-style boots
sold only at military PXs

547
00:38:22,066 --> 00:38:23,863
designed to walk
on the wings of planes.

548
00:38:23,968 --> 00:38:26,698
<i>And you can't buy at a PX
without a military ID,</i>

549
00:38:26,804 --> 00:38:28,738
so our suspect could be military.

550
00:38:28,839 --> 00:38:30,602
Did you guys narrow your list off of this?

551
00:38:30,708 --> 00:38:32,801
<i>- Yeah.
- Did Vallejo?</i>

552
00:38:32,910 --> 00:38:35,003
I don't know. I don't work in Vallejo.
I work here.

553
00:38:35,112 --> 00:38:37,239
Great. I'm gonna need photos
of those boot prints.

554
00:38:37,348 --> 00:38:39,316
<i>Sure, if you send me the handwriting.</i>

555
00:38:39,417 --> 00:38:41,009
I thought Questioned Documents
already did.

556
00:38:41,118 --> 00:38:42,608
<i>Nope. Vallejo's got them, not us.</i>

557
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:44,711
All right.
I'll have Questioned Documents...

558
00:38:44,822 --> 00:38:46,722
Forget it. I'll telefax it to you.

559
00:38:46,824 --> 00:38:48,291
We don't have telefax yet.

560
00:38:48,392 --> 00:38:50,986
<i>- Okay, I'll put it in the mail.
- We'll mail ours, too.</i>

561
00:38:51,095 --> 00:38:52,756
And call Mulanax in Vallejo.

562
00:38:52,863 --> 00:38:54,956
- Maybe he can get you a mimeo.
- Right.

563
00:38:55,066 --> 00:38:57,432
Why don't you just get a photo
off the original plaster cast?

564
00:38:57,535 --> 00:38:59,628
<i>We'd have to wait,
because they don't have a fax.</i>

565
00:38:59,737 --> 00:39:01,170
<i>We don't have a fax, either.</i>

566
00:39:01,272 --> 00:39:03,001
<i>Look, I'm just trying
to get us coordinated.</i>

567
00:39:03,107 --> 00:39:04,574
Have you called Solano Sheriff's Office?

568
00:39:04,675 --> 00:39:06,302
Why would I call Solano?

569
00:39:06,410 --> 00:39:10,005
<i>Because the two kids that got killed
last Christmas were Solano's.</i>

570
00:39:10,114 --> 00:39:11,308
I thought they were Vallejo.

571
00:39:11,415 --> 00:39:12,712
<i>No, they were over the county line</i>

572
00:39:12,817 --> 00:39:15,012
<i>so you're gonna need
to coordinate with them, too.</i>

573
00:39:15,119 --> 00:39:16,552
Okay.

574
00:39:16,654 --> 00:39:17,746
Bill.

575
00:39:18,456 --> 00:39:20,321
Can I have a word with you?

576
00:39:23,260 --> 00:39:25,353
Where did you see this guy?

577
00:39:26,163 --> 00:39:28,597
We got the call to circle the scene
and look for a Negro male adult.

578
00:39:28,699 --> 00:39:30,166
Where was he?

579
00:39:30,267 --> 00:39:32,701
On Jackson. Heading east.
About the middle of the block.

580
00:39:32,803 --> 00:39:33,816
And this is three minutes
after the shooting?

581
00:39:33,851 --> 00:39:34,829
And this is three minutes
after the shooting?

582
00:39:34,939 --> 00:39:36,099
Give or take. Yeah.

583
00:39:36,207 --> 00:39:38,437
- And you were heading east or west?
- We were going west.

584
00:39:38,542 --> 00:39:40,772
<i>All right, so you're
on Jackson going west.</i>

585
00:39:40,878 --> 00:39:44,006
So the cab was one block
catty-corner southwest?

586
00:39:44,115 --> 00:39:45,776
- Correct.
- Did you slow down?

587
00:39:45,883 --> 00:39:47,612
- Of course we slowed down.
- All right.

588
00:39:47,718 --> 00:39:49,948
<i>Listen, Dispatch said
it was a Negro male.</i>

589
00:39:50,054 --> 00:39:51,316
That was corrected.

590
00:39:51,422 --> 00:39:54,084
<i>No, but at the time
they hadn't changed it.</i>

591
00:39:54,191 --> 00:39:56,250
This guy was white.

592
00:39:56,360 --> 00:39:58,191
<i>Right, not in a hurry.
Kind of lumbering along like...</i>

593
00:39:58,295 --> 00:40:01,093
<i>Lumbering?
What do you mean, "lumbering"?</i>

594
00:40:02,199 --> 00:40:04,895
- Shuffling.
- Stocky? Had a crew cut?

595
00:40:05,870 --> 00:40:08,100
<i>Yeah, that's all correct.</i>

596
00:40:08,205 --> 00:40:09,934
<i>Listen, it was dark.</i>

597
00:40:10,875 --> 00:40:12,900
The guy was wearing a dark jacket.
There's no way...

598
00:40:13,010 --> 00:40:15,501
He would have been covered in blood.

599
00:40:17,114 --> 00:40:18,706
Did you stop him?

600
00:40:20,785 --> 00:40:22,548
Did you talk to him?

601
00:40:23,154 --> 00:40:25,088
- Yes? No?
- No.

602
00:40:25,990 --> 00:40:27,480
You need to get with a sketch artist.

603
00:40:27,591 --> 00:40:30,583
We have to put out
a new composite right away.

604
00:40:33,697 --> 00:40:36,632
<i>Five persons have been murdered
in the San Francisco area,</i>

605
00:40:36,734 --> 00:40:38,133
<i>and in each case the killer...</i>

606
00:40:38,235 --> 00:40:40,726
<i>"I shall wipe out a school bus
some morning... "</i>

607
00:40:40,838 --> 00:40:42,465
<i>San Francisco police...</i>

608
00:40:44,341 --> 00:40:46,866
<i>...to see the Stones in concert
this Sunday.</i>

609
00:40:47,178 --> 00:40:49,237
<i>The new letters
from the Zodiac Killer were sent to</i>

610
00:40:49,346 --> 00:40:51,371
<i>the City room of the
San Francisco Chronicle.</i>

611
00:40:51,482 --> 00:40:52,642
<i>One of the letters was...</i>

612
00:40:52,750 --> 00:40:55,275
Looming. No looming.

613
00:40:55,386 --> 00:40:58,480
- Have you considered the water theory?
- What?

614
00:40:58,589 --> 00:41:01,422
<i>Geographically, every attack
takes place near a body of water</i>

615
00:41:01,525 --> 00:41:02,651
- or a water-based name.
- This is your water theory?

616
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:05,194
Lake Berryessa. Blue Rock Springs.

617
00:41:05,296 --> 00:41:07,924
- Lake Herman.
- Wash-ington and Cherry?

618
00:41:09,433 --> 00:41:11,025
You think?

619
00:41:11,135 --> 00:41:12,159
No.

620
00:41:12,269 --> 00:41:13,668
<i>I'm reading this book,</i>

621
00:41:13,771 --> 00:41:15,398
<i>Homicide Investigation
by Lemoyne Snyder...</i>

622
00:41:15,506 --> 00:41:16,905
<i>- "Leymone. "
... and he says you look for patterns,</i>

623
00:41:17,007 --> 00:41:19,100
- so I'm looking for patterns.
- No.

624
00:41:19,210 --> 00:41:21,542
You can't think of this case
in normal police terms.

625
00:41:21,645 --> 00:41:23,806
- Why not?
- You got four crime scenes.

626
00:41:23,914 --> 00:41:26,815
<i>Solano, Vallejo, Berryessa, and here.</i>

627
00:41:26,917 --> 00:41:30,614
Not a single usable print at the
first three or in any of the letters?

628
00:41:31,088 --> 00:41:34,546
How does our master criminal come
to the city and leave a bloody latent?

629
00:41:34,658 --> 00:41:37,218
<i>I mean, assuming the gloves are his,</i>

630
00:41:37,328 --> 00:41:39,023
he shoots the cabbie
and then takes them off?

631
00:41:39,129 --> 00:41:40,289
<i>So it's not his print?</i>

632
00:41:40,397 --> 00:41:42,160
<i>Maybe, maybe not.
You're missing the point.</i>

633
00:41:42,266 --> 00:41:44,860
- The point is the first attack...
- David Faraday and Betty Jensen.

634
00:41:44,969 --> 00:41:46,527
They both die.

635
00:41:46,637 --> 00:41:49,105
<i>From there on out,
he only manages to kill the girls.</i>

636
00:41:49,206 --> 00:41:51,140
- Not for lack of trying.
- Not for lack of trying.

637
00:41:51,242 --> 00:41:54,769
<i>Mageau lives, Ferrin dies.
Hartnell lives, Shepard dies.</i>

638
00:41:54,879 --> 00:41:58,246
He gets so caught up with the women
he forgets to finish off the men.

639
00:41:58,349 --> 00:42:00,681
<i>Plus, they're all couples
and all on lover's lanes.</i>

640
00:42:00,784 --> 00:42:02,615
- Paul Stine is not.
- Exactly.

641
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:04,915
<i>Single, male cab driver
on Washington and Cherry doesn't fit.</i>

642
00:42:05,022 --> 00:42:06,387
Doesn't fit.

643
00:42:07,291 --> 00:42:09,555
<i>So, why does Zodiac kill him?</i>

644
00:42:12,396 --> 00:42:14,387
He's breaking the pattern.

645
00:42:23,607 --> 00:42:24,631
Yeah?

646
00:42:24,742 --> 00:42:28,439
<i>Someone claiming to be Zodiac
called Oakland PD a half-hour ago.</i>

647
00:42:28,546 --> 00:42:31,811
<i>He says he's gonna call in on Jim
Dunbar's morning show in three hours.</i>

648
00:42:31,916 --> 00:42:32,974
On television?

649
00:42:33,083 --> 00:42:35,142
<i>He wants Melvin Belli on
to counsel him.</i>

650
00:42:35,252 --> 00:42:37,345
All right. All right.
Let's go wake up Melvin.

651
00:42:39,823 --> 00:42:41,688
Animal crackers?

652
00:42:41,792 --> 00:42:43,089
Glove box.

653
00:42:43,193 --> 00:42:44,888
Are these windows bulletproof?

654
00:42:44,995 --> 00:42:47,520
<i>Yes, Melvin.
You don't have to lie down back there.</i>

655
00:42:47,631 --> 00:42:48,825
<i>This man is a marksman,</i>

656
00:42:48,933 --> 00:42:51,766
could snuff me out
at a moment's notice.

657
00:42:51,869 --> 00:42:53,234
Are you sure you're up for this?

658
00:42:53,337 --> 00:42:57,774
<i>Don't you worry about me, Inspector.
I'll be fine when the lights are on.</i>

659
00:42:57,875 --> 00:42:59,604
This man has asked for my help.

660
00:42:59,710 --> 00:43:01,769
The man you're worrying about
snuffing you out?

661
00:43:01,879 --> 00:43:03,813
<i>What are these, cookies?</i>

662
00:43:05,549 --> 00:43:07,642
<i>Dear Lord, do you ever clean this car?</i>

663
00:43:07,952 --> 00:43:11,388
- Shit.
- KGO must have tipped other stations.

664
00:43:20,965 --> 00:43:23,900
<i>Get him talking.
Convince him to meet you somewhere.</i>

665
00:43:24,001 --> 00:43:25,263
<i>If you see an opportunity,</i>

666
00:43:25,369 --> 00:43:28,133
we want you to suggest
Old St. Mary's Church in Chinatown.

667
00:43:28,238 --> 00:43:29,398
You'll be tracing the call?

668
00:43:29,506 --> 00:43:32,600
Pacific Telephone says you need to
keep him on the line for 15 minutes.

669
00:43:32,710 --> 00:43:34,940
<i>We can do that, can't we, Jim?</i>

670
00:43:37,314 --> 00:43:39,646
Fifteen seconds. Clear the set.

671
00:43:46,023 --> 00:43:48,218
<i>Here you go, you drunken reprobate.</i>

672
00:43:48,325 --> 00:43:52,125
<i>We interrupt our regular program
to bring you this news bulletin.</i>

673
00:43:52,229 --> 00:43:54,197
<i>Welcome to this special edition
of our show</i>

674
00:43:54,298 --> 00:43:56,163
<i>in which we are joined
by attorney Melvin Belli</i>

675
00:43:56,266 --> 00:43:59,633
<i>who the Zodiac Killer
personally requested to appear.</i>

676
00:43:59,737 --> 00:44:01,568
<i>Finish up, buddy, and put it in the sink.</i>

677
00:44:01,672 --> 00:44:04,664
<i>- Good morning, Melvin.
- Good morning, Jim.</i>

678
00:44:04,775 --> 00:44:08,006
<i>So, the phone lines are open.
Mr. Belli is here.</i>

679
00:44:08,112 --> 00:44:09,136
<i>Here to help, Jim.</i>

680
00:44:09,246 --> 00:44:11,077
<i>Yes. Here to help.</i>

681
00:44:11,181 --> 00:44:15,880
<i>And we ask the public not to call in,
so that the Zodiac himself can reach us.</i>

682
00:44:24,962 --> 00:44:28,363
<i>I saw your Star Trek, by the way.
It was excellent.</i>

683
00:44:28,465 --> 00:44:30,399
A shame about the show.

684
00:44:30,501 --> 00:44:31,968
Good people.

685
00:44:32,069 --> 00:44:35,800
<i>You know, I've often thought of
becoming an actor full-time.</i>

686
00:44:35,906 --> 00:44:37,168
What was your character's name?

687
00:44:37,274 --> 00:44:39,469
<i>- Gorgon.
- Gorgon. That's right.</i>

688
00:44:41,011 --> 00:44:42,911
Roll the tape. Get the tape.

689
00:44:43,013 --> 00:44:45,641
<i>Jim, we have a call. We're going live.</i>

690
00:44:46,917 --> 00:44:48,111
Hello?

691
00:44:51,655 --> 00:44:53,816
Hello? This is Melvin Belli.

692
00:44:55,025 --> 00:44:57,050
Who am I speaking with?

693
00:44:57,161 --> 00:44:59,561
<i>This is the Zodiac speaking.</i>

694
00:45:02,700 --> 00:45:06,568
Is there something I can call you
that's a little less ominous?

695
00:45:08,572 --> 00:45:09,596
<i>Sam.</i>

696
00:45:10,207 --> 00:45:12,175
Sam.

697
00:45:12,509 --> 00:45:16,138
<i>Is there somewhere we can meet, Sam,
and talk about this?</i>

698
00:45:16,580 --> 00:45:19,845
<i>Meet me on top of the Fairmont Hotel.</i>

699
00:45:19,950 --> 00:45:21,713
<i>Without anyone else or I'll jump...</i>

700
00:45:21,819 --> 00:45:23,616
Have a unit go to the Fairmont Hotel.

701
00:45:23,721 --> 00:45:25,951
<i>- Sam.
- Yes?</i>

702
00:45:26,623 --> 00:45:30,081
Do you think you need medical care?

703
00:45:30,194 --> 00:45:32,059
<i>Medical, not mental.</i>

704
00:45:32,162 --> 00:45:34,460
Do you have health problems?

705
00:45:34,565 --> 00:45:36,294
<i>I'm sick. I have headaches.</i>

706
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:38,129
Headaches?

707
00:45:38,235 --> 00:45:39,566
<i>I have headaches, too,</i>

708
00:45:39,670 --> 00:45:42,366
but a chiropractor stopped them
a week ago.

709
00:45:42,473 --> 00:45:44,270
<i>I think I can help you, Sam.</i>

710
00:45:46,710 --> 00:45:47,972
Sam?

711
00:45:49,913 --> 00:45:52,381
He knows they're tracing his calls.

712
00:45:56,053 --> 00:46:00,080
<i>Sam, we'd like you to know
that we are not tracing these calls.</i>

713
00:46:00,190 --> 00:46:04,422
<i>It's a long, difficult process
and ineffective with these short calls.</i>

714
00:46:09,933 --> 00:46:10,991
Sam?

715
00:46:13,270 --> 00:46:16,364
We're not tracing these calls.
You have my word.

716
00:46:17,274 --> 00:46:18,434
<i>Okay.</i>

717
00:46:18,942 --> 00:46:22,207
<i>Sam, you need to tell me
what your problem is.</i>

718
00:46:22,312 --> 00:46:24,177
<i>I don't want to go to the gas chamber.</i>

719
00:46:24,281 --> 00:46:26,772
<i>I have headaches.
I kill, I don't get them.</i>

720
00:46:26,884 --> 00:46:28,215
That is fucked up!

721
00:46:28,318 --> 00:46:31,776
<i>You want to live, don't you?
Well, this is your passport.</i>

722
00:46:31,889 --> 00:46:33,288
<i>How long have you been
having these headaches?</i>

723
00:46:33,390 --> 00:46:35,381
<i>Since I killed a kid.</i>

724
00:46:36,360 --> 00:46:38,555
<i>- Do you have blackouts?
- Yes.</i>

725
00:46:38,662 --> 00:46:42,359
<i>- Do you have fits?
- No. I just have headaches.</i>

726
00:46:42,499 --> 00:46:44,091
Did you attempt to call one other time

727
00:46:44,201 --> 00:46:46,795
when F. Lee Bailey was with us
two or three weeks ago?

728
00:46:46,904 --> 00:46:47,893
<i>Yes.</i>

729
00:46:48,005 --> 00:46:49,836
And why did you want
to talk to Mr. Bailey?

730
00:46:49,940 --> 00:46:52,875
<i>Why do you wanna talk to me, Sam?</i>

731
00:46:52,976 --> 00:46:54,603
<i>- I don't want to be hurt.
- Why is he calling?</i>

732
00:46:54,711 --> 00:46:56,679
<i>- Hey, just a second, buddy.
- I don't wanna go to the gas chamber.</i>

733
00:46:56,780 --> 00:46:58,441
<i>You won't get hurt if you talk to me.</i>

734
00:46:58,549 --> 00:47:01,541
And you're not going
to the gas chamber.

735
00:47:01,652 --> 00:47:04,018
I wouldn't think they would ask
for capital punishment.

736
00:47:04,121 --> 00:47:06,282
<i>We should ask the District Attorney.</i>

737
00:47:06,390 --> 00:47:08,449
<i>Do you want me to do that, Sam?</i>

738
00:47:08,559 --> 00:47:11,255
<i>Do you want me to talk
to the District Attorney?</i>

739
00:47:15,165 --> 00:47:16,894
<i>What was that, Sam?</i>

740
00:47:17,868 --> 00:47:19,961
<i>I did not say anything.</i>

741
00:47:20,070 --> 00:47:21,970
<i>We heard a scream.</i>

742
00:47:22,773 --> 00:47:24,900
<i>That was my headache.</i>

743
00:47:25,709 --> 00:47:28,678
You sound like you're in
a great deal of pain.

744
00:47:29,446 --> 00:47:32,472
<i>My head aches. I'm so sick.</i>

745
00:47:34,351 --> 00:47:35,841
<i>I'm gonna kill them.</i>

746
00:47:35,953 --> 00:47:38,786
<i>- Oh, okay.
- I'm gonna kill those kids!</i>

747
00:47:38,889 --> 00:47:40,481
Fantastic.

748
00:47:43,060 --> 00:47:44,459
<i>Sam?</i>

749
00:47:45,996 --> 00:47:50,228
<i>- Let's meet and talk. Just us.
- Okay.</i>

750
00:47:50,367 --> 00:47:53,029
<i>How about Old St. Mary's Church
in Chinatown?</i>

751
00:47:53,136 --> 00:47:54,433
<i>No.</i>

752
00:47:54,538 --> 00:47:58,406
<i>In front of the Daly City
St. Vincent de Paul at 10:30.</i>

753
00:47:58,508 --> 00:48:00,237
I'll see you there.

754
00:48:02,012 --> 00:48:03,946
<i>Take care of yourself, Sam.</i>

755
00:48:28,272 --> 00:48:29,466
<i>My, my, my.</i>

756
00:48:29,573 --> 00:48:33,270
You fellows certainly know
how to put on a secret meeting.

757
00:48:35,646 --> 00:48:37,136
<i>You know, the problem is,</i>

758
00:48:37,247 --> 00:48:40,080
<i>I don't want to go to the gas chamber.
I have headaches.</i>

759
00:48:40,183 --> 00:48:42,208
<i>I kill, I don't get them.</i>

760
00:48:42,319 --> 00:48:43,946
<i>No, it's not him.</i>

761
00:48:45,022 --> 00:48:48,150
It's the voice.
The voice is too high. It's too young.

762
00:48:48,258 --> 00:48:50,488
<i>All right.
Thanks for coming down, Bryan.</i>

763
00:48:50,594 --> 00:48:51,856
<i>Do you have blackouts?</i>

764
00:48:51,962 --> 00:48:53,793
That's okay. I got it.

765
00:49:00,003 --> 00:49:01,027
They pulled off the trace.

766
00:49:01,138 --> 00:49:04,403
Our Daly City no-show
called from a mental institution.

767
00:49:04,508 --> 00:49:06,373
Oakland PD's operator is sure

768
00:49:06,476 --> 00:49:08,944
the man she talked to
had a deeper voice.

769
00:49:09,046 --> 00:49:10,206
Calmer.

770
00:49:11,048 --> 00:49:13,209
Might have actually been him.

771
00:49:19,456 --> 00:49:22,619
"So I shall change
my way of collecting slaves.

772
00:49:22,726 --> 00:49:26,218
"I shall no longer announce to anyone
when I commit my murders.

773
00:49:26,330 --> 00:49:29,527
<i>"They shall look like routine robberies,
killings of anger</i>

774
00:49:29,633 --> 00:49:32,602
<i>"and a few fake accidents, et cetera.</i>

775
00:49:32,703 --> 00:49:33,761
"The police shall never catch me

776
00:49:33,870 --> 00:49:36,270
"because I have been
too clever for them.

777
00:49:36,373 --> 00:49:39,900
"I look like the description passed out
only when I do my thing.

778
00:49:40,010 --> 00:49:43,036
"The rest of the time
I look entirely different.

779
00:49:43,146 --> 00:49:47,640
"I shall not tell you what
my disguise consists of when I kill.

780
00:49:48,251 --> 00:49:50,776
<i>"As of yet I have left no
fingerprints behind me,</i>

781
00:49:50,887 --> 00:49:53,378
"contrary to what the police say.

782
00:49:53,490 --> 00:49:55,856
"I wear transparent fingertips.

783
00:49:56,827 --> 00:50:01,560
"All it is is two coats of airplane cement
coated on my fingertips.

784
00:50:01,665 --> 00:50:06,125
<i>"I enjoy needling the blue pigs.
Hey, blue pig, I was in the park.</i>

785
00:50:06,236 --> 00:50:11,697
"You were using fire trucks to mask
the sound of your cruising prowl cars.

786
00:50:11,808 --> 00:50:13,241
<i>"Hey, pig, doesn't it rile you up</i>

787
00:50:13,343 --> 00:50:16,437
"to have your nose
rubbed in your booboos?

788
00:50:16,546 --> 00:50:19,606
<i>"If you cops think I am going to take
on a bus the way I stated I was,</i>

789
00:50:19,716 --> 00:50:22,913
"you deserve to have holes
in your heads. "

790
00:50:24,888 --> 00:50:27,049
And you need to look at this.

791
00:50:29,926 --> 00:50:32,292
<i>"Take one bag of
ammonium nitrate fertilizer,</i>

792
00:50:32,396 --> 00:50:34,057
<i>"one gallon of stove oil,</i>

793
00:50:34,164 --> 00:50:36,291
"and dump a few bags
of gravel on top... "

794
00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:38,129
- Okay.
- It's a bomb.

795
00:50:38,235 --> 00:50:39,998
Okay. We gotta call the Army
and see if this

796
00:50:40,103 --> 00:50:42,833
science experiment could actually work.

797
00:50:42,939 --> 00:50:44,463
Another cipher.

798
00:50:46,710 --> 00:50:49,372
- When did these arrive?
- They arrived this morning.

799
00:50:49,479 --> 00:50:50,878
Are you planning to publish?

800
00:50:50,981 --> 00:50:52,175
Robert.

801
00:50:53,683 --> 00:50:55,617
We should have a drink.

802
00:50:59,790 --> 00:51:01,155
Thank you.

803
00:51:02,993 --> 00:51:05,223
<i>So, tell me about yourself.</i>

804
00:51:05,328 --> 00:51:08,820
- You married?
- Divorced. Two kids.

805
00:51:09,866 --> 00:51:11,731
What do you do for fun?

806
00:51:13,270 --> 00:51:14,897
I love to read.

807
00:51:15,839 --> 00:51:18,307
- I enjoy books.
- Those are the same things.

808
00:51:18,408 --> 00:51:20,899
Why you been going through my trash?

809
00:51:23,780 --> 00:51:25,645
I'll come back to that.

810
00:51:26,183 --> 00:51:27,844
How did you know
he was gonna send another code?

811
00:51:27,951 --> 00:51:29,680
I just guessed.

812
00:51:29,786 --> 00:51:31,947
- Just guessed.
- The first one seemed too easy.

813
00:51:32,055 --> 00:51:34,387
<i>All right, this can no longer be ignored.</i>

814
00:51:34,491 --> 00:51:38,086
- What is that you're drinking?
- It's an Aqua Velva.

815
00:51:38,195 --> 00:51:41,096
You wouldn't make fun of it
if you tried it.

816
00:51:50,607 --> 00:51:53,007
But who actually cracked the code?

817
00:51:53,810 --> 00:51:56,040
A married couple who like puzzles.

818
00:51:56,146 --> 00:51:58,307
So what's that tell us about the Zodiac?

819
00:51:58,415 --> 00:51:59,712
- He's no expert.
- Right.

820
00:51:59,816 --> 00:52:01,477
It's just a simple substitution code

821
00:52:01,585 --> 00:52:03,780
like the one that
we used to do as boy scouts.

822
00:52:03,887 --> 00:52:05,514
<i>"A" is one, "B" is two.</i>

823
00:52:05,622 --> 00:52:06,953
<i>We weren't all boy scouts, Robert.</i>

824
00:52:07,057 --> 00:52:10,584
<i>Well, it's not that hard.
You just got to know where to start.</i>

825
00:52:10,694 --> 00:52:12,457
In the first cipher...

826
00:52:12,562 --> 00:52:13,790
You actually carry that around with you?

827
00:52:13,897 --> 00:52:15,592
- Why?
- No reason.

828
00:52:16,733 --> 00:52:20,169
What's the most common double
consonant in the English language?

829
00:52:20,270 --> 00:52:21,362
Consonant?

830
00:52:21,471 --> 00:52:22,768
- The double "L."
- Double "L."

831
00:52:22,873 --> 00:52:26,707
<i>And what's the one word that we know
that he'll use in here, at least once?</i>

832
00:52:26,810 --> 00:52:27,868
<i>- "Kill. "
- Right, "kill. "</i>

833
00:52:27,978 --> 00:52:29,445
<i>So the Hardens start looking
for double symbols,</i>

834
00:52:29,546 --> 00:52:31,514
<i>which they find here, here, and here.</i>

835
00:52:31,615 --> 00:52:34,049
Each with the same
two symbols preceding them.

836
00:52:34,151 --> 00:52:36,085
So now they've got
a repeating four-letter word

837
00:52:36,186 --> 00:52:38,211
ending with two symbols
that they assume stand for "L."

838
00:52:38,321 --> 00:52:39,754
And since they think the whole word
is "kill" then...

839
00:52:39,856 --> 00:52:43,223
<i>Then you got your "K," you got your "I,"
and you're on your way.</i>

840
00:52:43,326 --> 00:52:45,191
But how do you go
from "A" is one and "B" is two

841
00:52:45,295 --> 00:52:46,660
to figuring out this whole code?

842
00:52:46,763 --> 00:52:49,630
<i>Well, same way I did.
You go to the library.</i>

843
00:52:52,969 --> 00:52:54,869
<i>In this book,</i>

844
00:52:54,971 --> 00:52:59,067
the author presents a very simple
substitution code in the preface.

845
00:52:59,176 --> 00:53:02,111
Eight of the 26 symbols that
he suggests are found in this cipher.

846
00:53:02,212 --> 00:53:03,474
<i>Yeah, but there are non-letter symbols</i>

847
00:53:03,580 --> 00:53:04,979
because there's all
these medieval ones.

848
00:53:05,081 --> 00:53:07,606
<i>I thought they looked medieval, too.</i>

849
00:53:08,518 --> 00:53:10,315
But then I found a code
written in the Middle Ages.

850
00:53:10,420 --> 00:53:11,444
Guess what it's called?

851
00:53:12,255 --> 00:53:14,018
The Zodiac Alphabet.

852
00:53:15,992 --> 00:53:17,186
Jesus.

853
00:53:18,361 --> 00:53:19,794
What do you want out of this?

854
00:53:19,896 --> 00:53:21,386
- What?
- What's your angle?

855
00:53:21,498 --> 00:53:24,331
This is good business
for everyone but you.

856
00:53:27,504 --> 00:53:29,267
How do you mean "business"?

857
00:53:32,342 --> 00:53:34,674
Hey. Come to bed.

858
00:53:34,778 --> 00:53:38,043
I'll be up in a minute.
I need to make a phone call.

859
00:53:49,659 --> 00:53:51,320
<i>- Hello?
- Bill?</i>

860
00:53:52,195 --> 00:53:54,561
There's not many basements
in California.

861
00:53:54,664 --> 00:53:56,825
<i>"Basement for future use. "</i>

862
00:53:56,933 --> 00:53:58,423
That's right.

863
00:53:58,535 --> 00:54:02,164
<i>I'll have Vallejo and Napa
check with their city planners.</i>

864
00:54:02,272 --> 00:54:04,467
<i>- Get some sleep.
- Yeah, sure.</i>

865
00:54:17,420 --> 00:54:20,253
<i>"Dear Melvin,
this is the Zodiac speaking.</i>

866
00:54:20,357 --> 00:54:22,518
<i>"I wish you a happy Christmas.</i>

867
00:54:22,626 --> 00:54:26,062
<i>"The one thing I ask of you is this.
Please help me.</i>

868
00:54:26,162 --> 00:54:29,563
"I cannot reach out for help
because this thing in me won't let me. "

869
00:54:29,666 --> 00:54:30,997
Thank you.

870
00:54:31,101 --> 00:54:34,298
"I am finding it extremely difficult
to hold it in check

871
00:54:34,404 --> 00:54:37,032
"and I am afraid I will lose control again

872
00:54:37,140 --> 00:54:39,938
"and take my ninth
and possibly tenth victim. "

873
00:54:40,043 --> 00:54:42,341
<i>Melvin, he's reaching out to you.</i>

874
00:54:42,445 --> 00:54:43,776
Absolutely.

875
00:54:43,880 --> 00:54:47,407
<i>Inspectors, he sent this letter
directly to my residence.</i>

876
00:54:47,517 --> 00:54:50,543
<i>It is a cry for help,
intended as a private communiqu.</i>

877
00:54:50,654 --> 00:54:52,781
<i>Which is why
you contacted the Chronicle.</i>

878
00:54:52,889 --> 00:54:55,881
The people have a right to know.
Toddy?

879
00:54:55,992 --> 00:54:59,052
- When did the letter arrive?
- In the middle of last week.

880
00:54:59,162 --> 00:55:01,562
I was away on safari.

881
00:55:01,665 --> 00:55:03,428
What did you gentlemen
do for Christmas?

882
00:55:03,533 --> 00:55:05,831
- You're looking at it.
- You must see Africa.

883
00:55:05,935 --> 00:55:11,134
Cradle of civilization.
Fascinating people. Beautiful. Savage.

884
00:55:11,241 --> 00:55:15,007
- Back to the killer who wrote to you.
- Yes. Of course.

885
00:55:15,111 --> 00:55:17,011
It is my belief
that he only penned this letter

886
00:55:17,113 --> 00:55:20,139
because he couldn't get through to me
on the Dunbar show or here.

887
00:55:20,250 --> 00:55:22,775
- He tried to contact you here?
- Several times.

888
00:55:22,886 --> 00:55:25,013
<i>I was out,
but he spoke with my housekeeper.</i>

889
00:55:25,121 --> 00:55:26,179
Didn't leave a number.

890
00:55:26,289 --> 00:55:28,814
He's kind of crafty like that.
Do you mind if I speak to her?

891
00:55:28,925 --> 00:55:32,019
Not at all. But the real story is the letter.

892
00:55:32,128 --> 00:55:34,187
- I'll be back.
- Yeah.

893
00:55:34,297 --> 00:55:35,423
She's right this way.

894
00:55:35,532 --> 00:55:40,868
<i>Inspector Toschi, it is my belief
this is a window into this man's soul.</i>

895
00:55:40,970 --> 00:55:42,665
Killing is his compulsion.

896
00:55:42,772 --> 00:55:45,366
<i>Even though he tries to ignore it,
it drives him.</i>

897
00:55:45,475 --> 00:55:46,499
It's in his blood.

898
00:55:46,609 --> 00:55:49,669
Could be.
Or maybe he just likes the attention.

899
00:56:33,523 --> 00:56:38,790
<i>I didn't mean to scare you,
but your right rear wheel is loose.</i>

900
00:56:38,895 --> 00:56:39,919
Really?

901
00:56:40,029 --> 00:56:43,521
<i>If you like,
I could tighten the lugs up for you.</i>

902
00:56:46,136 --> 00:56:47,262
If you don't mind.

903
00:56:47,370 --> 00:56:49,838
<i>Well, you can't be too careful.</i>

904
00:57:24,274 --> 00:57:26,674
- All done.
- Thank you.

905
00:57:26,776 --> 00:57:29,006
No problem. Have a good night.

906
00:57:33,983 --> 00:57:35,280
It's okay.

907
00:58:29,639 --> 00:58:31,266
Are you okay?

908
00:58:32,775 --> 00:58:35,437
<i>Yeah. Yeah, we're fine.</i>

909
00:58:36,279 --> 00:58:38,713
Must have been worse than I thought.

910
00:58:38,815 --> 00:58:41,682
I can give you a lift to a service station.

911
00:58:43,920 --> 00:58:45,012
Okay.

912
00:58:51,361 --> 00:58:53,386
It's okay. Come on.

913
00:59:01,104 --> 00:59:03,265

She flagged me down.

925

- She said she jumped from a car.

926

987
01:03:37,113 --> 01:03:38,478

- Okay. Totally solid point. Okay.

That's the only place
that word and that symbol

ever appeared together
before the letters.

Not a peep in four months.

1003

First he won't shut up and now...

1004
01:04:24,594 --> 01:04:26,858
Maybe we drove him underground.

1005
01:04:27,530 --> 01:04:29,122
Maybe he's gone.

1064
01:07:46,328 --> 01:07:48,387
My children are terrified of Glynnis.

1065
01:07:48,497 --> 01:07:49,759
<i>Me, too.</i>

1066
01:07:53,169 --> 01:07:54,295
<i>So, the gun range?</i>

1067
01:07:54,403 --> 01:07:57,372
We're... I'm working on...
Do you know the Zodiac?

1068
01:07:57,473 --> 01:07:58,770
- Yeah.
- I'm working with...

1069
01:07:58,874 --> 01:08:01,342
- Do you know who Paul Avery is?
- Sounds kind of familiar.

1070
01:08:01,444 --> 01:08:03,173
He's the writer
that the Zodiac threatened.

1071
01:08:03,279 --> 01:08:04,473
<i>Oh, yeah, I saw that on TV.</i>

1072
01:08:04,580 --> 01:08:07,708
<i>Well, I work near him
and he's going down tonight</i>

1073
01:08:07,817 --> 01:08:10,980
to track an anonymous tipster
down in Riverside.

1074
01:08:12,154 --> 01:08:14,213
Where is Riverside?

1075
01:08:14,323 --> 01:08:15,790
It's near L.A.

1076
01:08:15,891 --> 01:08:19,486
<i>Oh, wow. I don't think Paul knows
that it's that far away.</i>

1077
01:08:21,697 --> 01:08:23,688
Sounds kind of dangerous.

1078
01:08:24,967 --> 01:08:27,868
Yeah. How do you mean?

1079
01:08:27,970 --> 01:08:30,370
<i>Well, you said it was
an anonymous tip, right?</i>

1080
01:08:30,473 --> 01:08:31,906
Yeah.

1081
01:08:32,007 --> 01:08:35,534
<i>So it could be an ambush.
I mean, it could be the Zodiac.</i>

1082
01:08:37,079 --> 01:08:39,479
Don't you think it's kind of stupid?

1083
01:08:39,582 --> 01:08:42,210
<i>Yeah, yeah. Well, Paul has a gun.</i>

1084
01:08:46,055 --> 01:08:48,523
<i>So, do you know what's good here?</i>

1085
01:08:50,359 --> 01:08:52,486
I've never been here before.

1086
01:08:54,630 --> 01:08:56,598
<i>The pasta, spaghetti?</i>

1087
01:08:58,334 --> 01:09:00,393
Are you ready to order yet?

1088
01:09:01,470 --> 01:09:04,268
<i>Yeah, I'll have the penne vodka.
But could you do it in a cream sauce?</i>

1089
01:09:04,373 --> 01:09:05,670
Of course.

1090
01:09:10,646 --> 01:09:12,841
Maybe give us another minute?

1091
01:09:14,717 --> 01:09:16,651
Do you have any change?

1092
01:09:16,752 --> 01:09:18,913
<i>Oh, wait, no wait, hold on.</i>

1093
01:09:19,021 --> 01:09:20,545
Nope. That's a penny.

1094
01:09:20,656 --> 01:09:22,055
Do you have to make a phone call?

1095
01:09:22,158 --> 01:09:25,616
<i>Yeah, you know,
when you were saying that the Zodiac...</i>

1096
01:09:26,228 --> 01:09:27,889
<i>You know, when you said it
was dangerous, I just thought</i>

1097
01:09:27,997 --> 01:09:30,022
<i>- that it is dangerous, and it's...
- Stupid?</i>

1098
01:09:30,132 --> 01:09:31,724
Stupid. And I just thought that

1099
01:09:31,834 --> 01:09:35,565
I should call his wife
and just see if she's heard from him.

1100
01:09:37,907 --> 01:09:39,340
I have some change.

1101
01:09:58,561 --> 01:10:01,826
<i>Okay. Well, she said
she'd call when she heard from him.</i>

1102
01:10:01,931 --> 01:10:03,364
- Good.
- Yeah.

1103
01:10:04,767 --> 01:10:08,203
<i>Melanie, I should really go home
and wait for the call.</i>

1104
01:10:11,340 --> 01:10:14,798
Is this some sleazy plan
to get me to go home with you?

1105
01:10:15,511 --> 01:10:16,978
What? No.

1106
01:10:19,481 --> 01:10:21,449
I'll get the food to go.

1107
01:10:23,152 --> 01:10:24,278
Hello!

1108
01:10:40,502 --> 01:10:43,335
Hi! I'm supposed
to meet somebody here.

1109
01:11:01,590 --> 01:11:02,989
Anything?

1110
01:11:06,629 --> 01:11:07,891
You don't have to stay.

1111
01:11:07,997 --> 01:11:09,430
Are you kidding?

1112
01:11:09,531 --> 01:11:12,625
This is the most interesting date
I've ever had.

1113
01:11:16,905 --> 01:11:17,997
<i>- Paul?
- Robert?</i>

1114
01:11:18,107 --> 01:11:18,887
- Yes.
- You sitting down?

1115
01:11:18,922 --> 01:11:19,668
- Yes.
- You sitting down?

1116
01:11:19,775 --> 01:11:20,867
<i>Yes.</i>

1117
01:11:20,976 --> 01:11:22,773
You're not gonna believe this.

1118
01:11:22,878 --> 01:11:23,867
Dave!

1119
01:11:23,979 --> 01:11:26,573
<i>In a bizarre twist,
the hunted has become hunter.</i>

1120
01:11:26,682 --> 01:11:30,448
<i>San Francisco Chronicle reporter

What?

1126
01:11:44,733 --> 01:11:45,893
- He didn't call you about this?
- Hang on!

1127
01:11:46,001 --> 01:11:47,491
<i>The Riverside killer

<i>that I then took personally to
the Office of Questioned Documents.</i>

<i>And what did this expert tell you?</i>

1130
01:11:53,809 --> 01:11:55,333
<i>What I knew in my gut, Ron.</i>

1131

<i>The handwriting matches Zodiac's.</i>

1132
01:11:57,980 --> 01:12:00,312
How'd he get the evidence
out of Riverside?

1133
01:12:00,416 --> 01:12:02,611
<i>He took it to Sherwood
without telling us, the son of a bitch.</i>

1134
01:12:02,718 --> 01:12:03,912
You know how bad this looks?

1135
01:12:04,019 --> 01:12:06,214
<i>Hey, how do we know
that this lead is real?</i>

1136
01:12:06,322 --> 01:12:08,586
It's very real. You know how I know?

1137
01:12:08,691 --> 01:12:10,556
Because I saw it on TV.

1138
01:12:16,598 --> 01:12:17,565

<i>Dave, you know Mel Nicolai.

<i>Dave, come on.</i>

1148
01:12:31,980 --> 01:12:33,948

People talk.

1149

<i>I don't ever talk about an open

Dave? Hey. Hi.

1151
01:12:39,888 --> 01:12:42,448
Paul Avery. Can I catch a ride
with you gents when we get there?

1152
01:12:42,558 --> 01:12:44,389
<i>Not a good idea, Paul.</i>

1153
01:12:45,260 --> 01:12:48,161
He's gonna make me take a cab

Great. Thanks for having us
down today.

1161
01:13:08,016 --> 01:13:10,507
Not at all.
I hear you have some files for us.

1162
01:13:10,619 --> 01:13:12,109
I'll show you mine. You show me yours.

1163
01:13:12,221 --> 01:13:14,587
- Frisco huh?
- That's right. San Francisco.

1164

Here's what we know.

1167
01:13:19,661 --> 01:13:22,221
Cheri Jo Bates attended
Riverside Community College.

1168

<i>She studies in the library
the night of October 30th, 1966.</i>

1169
01:13:26,702 --> 01:13:30,502
<i>She leaves with an unidentified male

<i>Her body's found the next morning
in a parking lot, stabbed to death.</i>

<i>Someone cut the coil in the distributor,
the battery died.</i>

<i>The someone comes back,
offers to help.</i>

1174
01:13:41,383 --> 01:13:43,510
- Like Kathleen Johns.
- Who?

1175
01:13:43,619 --> 01:13:46,281
<i>A woman outside of Modesto,
might be a Zodiac victim.</i>

1176

Might. Might be.
I have her comp right here in this file.

1177
01:13:49,992 --> 01:13:51,186
Okay.

1178
01:13:51,293 --> 01:13:54,387
<i>A typewritten confession was sent

<i>on November 29th,
a month after Bates's murder.</i>

1180
01:13:57,366 --> 01:13:58,765
They ran it.

"I'm not sick. I am insane.
But that will not stop the game.

"This letter should be published
for all to read. "

1183
01:14:06,108 --> 01:14:07,473
He wants to be published.
He calls it a game.

<i>I mean, this could be our boy.</i>

1185

1187
01:14:19,221 --> 01:14:21,018
<i>Double postage, just like Zodiac.</i>

1188
01:14:22,624 --> 01:14:25,491
These are what Sherwood Morrill
matched to the Zodiac letters?

1189
01:14:25,594 --> 01:14:27,619
These and the desktop. Don.

1190
01:14:27,729 --> 01:14:32,029
This was found a couple of months later
by a janitor in RCC storage.

1191
01:14:41,009 --> 01:14:43,603
Sherwood got
a handwriting match off wood?

1192
01:14:45,547 --> 01:14:47,811
Who etches in their own handwriting?

1193

How did Paul Avery
get his hands on the exemplars?

1196
01:14:54,289 --> 01:14:55,620
I gave them to him.

1197
01:14:55,724 --> 01:14:57,589
We talked on the phone the other day
for about an hour.

1198
01:14:57,693 --> 01:14:59,160
And I told him you were gonna be here.

1199
01:14:59,261 --> 01:15:00,922
- You told him we were meeting?
- Yeah.

1200
01:15:01,029 --> 01:15:03,224
I also told him
we don't think this is Zodiac.

1201
01:15:03,332 --> 01:15:05,391
<i>Okay, wait a minute.</i>

1202
01:15:05,501 --> 01:15:08,561
- You don't think this is Zodiac?
- We got a guy we like for it.

1203
01:15:08,670 --> 01:15:10,228
<i>We don't have enough
to pin it on him yet,</i>

1204
01:15:10,339 --> 01:15:11,567
but we're pretty sure it's him.

1205
01:15:11,673 --> 01:15:14,540
<i>If you don't think this is Zodiac,
then why give anything to Avery?</i>

1206
01:15:14,643 --> 01:15:16,270
I'm trying to cooperate.

1207
01:15:16,378 --> 01:15:19,176
<i>Oh, that's how you cooperate?
By giving information to reporters?</i>

1208
01:15:19,250 --> 01:15:20,774
<i>Look, I don't know
about the handwriting,</i>

1209
01:15:20,885 --> 01:15:22,113
<i>but Sherwood says it's a match, right?</i>

1210
01:15:22,220 --> 01:15:24,620
<i>So, let's just say
that your guy did Cheri Jo.</i>

1211
01:15:24,722 --> 01:15:25,848
He types the confession.

1212
01:15:25,957 --> 01:15:29,085
<i>Zodiac reads it in the paper, and he
writes a letter taking credit for it.</i>

1213
01:15:29,193 --> 01:15:30,717
<i>Now, that's something he's done before.</i>

1214
01:15:30,828 --> 01:15:33,422
<i>Look, now you have everything we have.</i>

1215
01:15:33,531 --> 01:15:36,830
<i>But, in my opinion,
you guys came south for nothing.</i>

1216
01:15:36,934 --> 01:15:39,027
<i>FUBAR, gentlemen, FUBAR.</i>

1217
01:15:39,136 --> 01:15:41,866
I don't care what he says.
This still could be Z.

1218
01:15:41,973 --> 01:15:45,170
The problem is
the entire state already thinks it is.

1219
01:15:45,276 --> 01:15:48,609
<i>Well, there's your press agent.
Talk to him about it.</i>

1220
01:15:51,148 --> 01:15:53,082
I come in peace.
I don't want any trouble.

1221
01:15:53,184 --> 01:15:55,152
<i>I really don't want to talk to you
right now, Paul. Not now.</i>

1222
01:15:55,253 --> 01:15:59,189
<i>- Just trying to do my job.
- Oh, really? Well, now I can't do mine.</i>

1223
01:15:59,290 --> 01:16:01,315
<i>We're already screwed with
the amount of tips we got on this thing,</i>

1224
01:16:01,425 --> 01:16:03,120
and you just freaked out the entire state.

1225
01:16:03,227 --> 01:16:06,526
<i>I have got Napa, Vallejo, and DOJ
looking at me sideways</i>

1226
01:16:06,631 --> 01:16:09,429
and Riverside's telling me
I'm on a snipe hunt!

1227
01:16:09,534 --> 01:16:12,162
<i>Jesus. Hey, Cheri Jo Bates was a gift.
I gave that to you.</i>

1228
01:16:12,270 --> 01:16:13,828
You and Armstrong
never would have found her.

1229
01:16:13,938 --> 01:16:16,202
This may not be Zodiac.
Does that matter to you?

1230
01:16:16,307 --> 01:16:17,638
- What if it is?
- Does it matter that Riverside may not

1231
01:16:17,742 --> 01:16:19,801
be able to make a case
against their suspect because of you?

1232
01:16:19,911 --> 01:16:21,811
<i>Tell it to Sherwood.
I'm out here, beating the bushes,</i>

1233
01:16:21,913 --> 01:16:23,471
trying to draw him out.
We're in this together.

1234
01:16:23,581 --> 01:16:24,946
<i>No, we're not in anything together, Paul,</i>

1235
01:16:25,049 --> 01:16:26,914
because I'm not interested
in upping my circulation.

1236
01:16:27,018 --> 01:16:29,885
<i>Oh, boy. He wrote me.
He threatened my life.</i>

1237
01:16:29,987 --> 01:16:31,579
<i>Hey, Bullitt!</i>

1238
01:16:31,689 --> 01:16:35,648
<i>Been a year-and-a-half,
you gonna catch this fucking guy or not?</i>

1239
01:16:37,795 --> 01:16:40,161
- Go fuck yourself.
- Happily.

1240
01:16:40,264 --> 01:16:42,255
<i>You should have called me, Paul.</i>

1241
01:16:47,838 --> 01:16:49,032
Thank you.

1242
01:17:02,320 --> 01:17:04,049
<i>- Did you see this?
- Unfortunately, yes.</i>

1243
01:17:04,155 --> 01:17:06,817
Here comes every lunatic in California.

1244
01:17:07,692 --> 01:17:08,989
I'm the Zodiac.

1245
01:17:09,093 --> 01:17:10,651
And how did you kill your victims?

1246
01:17:10,761 --> 01:17:13,389
<i>With a gun. No, with a hammer.</i>

1247
01:17:13,497 --> 01:17:14,794
All I'm authorized to tell you

1248
01:17:14,899 --> 01:17:16,457
is that he's still under
government employment.

1249
01:17:16,567 --> 01:17:19,627
- And who authorized you to tell me this?
- That's all I'm authorized to say.

1250
01:17:19,737 --> 01:17:21,864
<i>Only a little rat bastard like Andre</i>

1251
01:17:21,973 --> 01:17:24,533
could have done something
like cut off all the victims' hands.

1252
01:17:24,642 --> 01:17:27,008
Zodiac didn't cut off
any of the victims' hands.

1253
01:17:27,111 --> 01:17:28,840
<i>- Are you sure?
- Yes, sir.</i>

1254
01:17:28,946 --> 01:17:31,471
Travis and I worked here
side by side for 10 years.

1255
01:17:31,582 --> 01:17:35,643
His foot gets crushed in an accident
and the killings begin.

1256
01:17:35,753 --> 01:17:37,243
- Coincidence?
- I don't know.

1257
01:17:37,355 --> 01:17:39,220
<i>You're a cop, man. Do the math.</i>

1258
01:17:43,628 --> 01:17:46,859
Have you considered
the killer might be Paul Avery?

1259
01:17:46,964 --> 01:17:48,124
Frequently.

1260
01:17:48,733 --> 01:17:50,098
<i>He was drinking Coors,
getting a load on.</i>

1261
01:17:50,668 --> 01:17:54,297
Starts talking about hunting people.
Like that book.

1262
01:17:54,405 --> 01:17:56,566
Says how you can put a light
at the end of a gun

1263
01:17:56,674 --> 01:17:58,198
to use as a sight in the dark.

1264
01:17:58,309 --> 01:18:00,072
- He said that?
- Yeah.

1265
01:18:00,177 --> 01:18:03,044
<i>So I asked him,
"How would you get away with it?"</i>

1266
01:18:03,314 --> 01:18:05,043
<i>And he said, "It would be easy</i>

1267
01:18:05,149 --> 01:18:07,583
"'cause there'd be no real motive
to the thing. "

1268
01:18:07,685 --> 01:18:09,550
Then he said he'd write letters
to the police

1269
01:18:09,654 --> 01:18:11,451
and call himself Zodiac
to mess with them.

1270
01:18:11,555 --> 01:18:13,147
Leigh liked messing with people.

1271
01:18:13,257 --> 01:18:16,249
- You're positive he said "Zodiac"?
- Yeah.

1272
01:18:16,360 --> 01:18:19,454
I thought it was a stupid name.
So I told him.

1273
01:18:19,563 --> 01:18:22,999
<i>He got up all upset and said,
"I don't care what you think.</i>

1274
01:18:23,100 --> 01:18:25,728
"I've thought about it a long time
and that's the name I'm gonna use. "

1275
01:18:25,836 --> 01:18:29,169
Did you feel like he'd been
thinking about it a long time?

1276
01:18:29,273 --> 01:18:32,504
He was raw about losing his job
at the school.

1277
01:18:32,610 --> 01:18:35,602
He talked about shooting out
the tires of a school bus

1278
01:18:35,713 --> 01:18:38,113
and picking off the little darlings.

1279
01:18:38,215 --> 01:18:42,276
- He actually used those words?
- That's what made me remember.

1280
01:18:42,386 --> 01:18:44,820
<i>Afterwards, I told my wife
I didn't wanna see him again.</i>

1281
01:18:44,922 --> 01:18:46,651
And I haven't since.

1282
01:18:46,757 --> 01:18:49,248
<i>Other thing is, Leigh's into skin diving.</i>

1283
01:18:49,360 --> 01:18:51,419
I know he's been up to that lake
a bunch of times.

1284
01:18:51,529 --> 01:18:53,895
Lake Berryessa?
Did you ever go with him?

1285
01:18:53,998 --> 01:18:57,957
Couple times. We went fishing
by Putah Creek near there.

1286
01:18:58,069 --> 01:18:59,536
Tell him when you put it together.

1287
01:18:59,637 --> 01:19:04,336
<i>About a year ago, in the paper,
there was a story about the Zodiac.</i>

1288
01:19:04,442 --> 01:19:07,536
And it all comes back.
I tried to call the local cops.

1289
01:19:07,645 --> 01:19:09,237
They blew him off.
Thought he was a nut.

1290
01:19:09,346 --> 01:19:13,146
And you're sure
the conversation you had about Zodiac

1291
01:19:13,250 --> 01:19:17,016
<i>took place on January 1st, 1968?</i>

1292
01:19:17,121 --> 01:19:18,850
It couldn't have been any later.

1293
01:19:18,956 --> 01:19:21,857
I started a new job in L.A.
On January 20th.

1294
01:19:22,393 --> 01:19:23,860
I had to move.

1295
01:19:23,961 --> 01:19:26,429
<i>- This is my problem. This guy...
- Arthur Leigh Allen?</i>

1296
01:19:26,530 --> 01:19:29,124
<i>This guy, Leigh,
just lays out his entire evil plan</i>

1297
01:19:29,233 --> 01:19:30,723
to a fishing buddy on New Year's Day?

1298
01:19:30,835 --> 01:19:33,633
<i>I don't know.
He's angry, he's been drinking,</i>

1299
01:19:33,738 --> 01:19:35,865
been thinking about it for a while.
I can buy that.

1300
01:19:35,973 --> 01:19:38,305
So why didn't Cheney
contact us sooner?

1301
01:19:38,409 --> 01:19:39,842
I checked. He did.

1302
01:19:39,944 --> 01:19:42,936
First recorded contact
with the police department about Allen

1303
01:19:43,047 --> 01:19:45,845
<i>was in Pomona. January 10th, 1970.</i>

1304
01:19:45,950 --> 01:19:47,042
He just got lost in the shuffle.

1305
01:19:47,151 --> 01:19:48,812
Did Cheney have anything
against Allen?

1306
01:19:48,919 --> 01:19:50,216
Did Allen screw his wife or anything?

1307
01:19:50,321 --> 01:19:52,016
We're gonna do
a full background check.

1308
01:19:52,123 --> 01:19:54,785
<i>But I got to tell you, I like this guy.</i>

1309
01:19:55,826 --> 01:19:57,726
<i>So, let's pull
some handwriting samples.</i>

1310
01:19:59,463 --> 01:20:02,364
Hi. I talked to Sherwood.
He got the samples.

1311
01:20:02,466 --> 01:20:04,400
- What are you having?
- BLT.

1312
01:20:07,037 --> 01:20:09,562
<i>So, the check stubs are a wash.
There's not enough handwriting.</i>

1313
01:20:09,673 --> 01:20:12,198
<i>The application's got more,
but it doesn't look like Z's,</i>

1314
01:20:12,309 --> 01:20:14,607
<i>so he can't rule him in.
But he can't rule him out, either.</i>

1315
01:20:14,712 --> 01:20:17,579
<i>- Well, that's vague.
- He needs more samples.</i>

1316
01:20:18,649 --> 01:20:20,742
<i>Also, our guy is a pervert.</i>

1317
01:20:21,819 --> 01:20:23,684
<i>When Mel got the application
from Valley Springs,</i>

1318
01:20:23,788 --> 01:20:26,052
they told him that
Allen had been fired for touching kids.

1319
01:20:26,157 --> 01:20:28,284
- Touching?
- Polite euphemism.

1320
01:20:29,960 --> 01:20:33,088
- So what do you want to do?
- Make some phone calls.

1321
01:20:33,197 --> 01:20:35,825
- Are you done with the fries?
- Go ahead.

1322
01:20:35,933 --> 01:20:37,366
<i>Did you and Mr. Cheney have a chance</i>

1323
01:20:37,468 --> 01:20:39,663
<i>to look at the copies
of the Zodiac letters we sent you?</i>

1324
01:20:39,770 --> 01:20:42,466
Yeah.
Some of this stuff is pretty creepy.

1325
01:20:42,573 --> 01:20:45,667
<i>- Yeah, we know that.
- I mean, creepy like Leigh.</i>

1326
01:20:46,043 --> 01:20:48,534
He misspells words like that.
He thinks it's funny.

1327
01:20:48,646 --> 01:20:50,443
What about the handwriting?

1328
01:20:50,548 --> 01:20:53,483
<i>I don't know.
Don't you have experts for that stuff?</i>

1329
01:20:53,584 --> 01:20:56,678
Our man at Questioned Documents
says it's inconclusive.

1330
01:20:56,787 --> 01:20:58,618
Maybe he did it with his other hand.

1331
01:20:58,722 --> 01:20:59,984
<i>The letters are a little too neat</i>

1332
01:21:00,090 --> 01:21:02,490
<i>for someone to have written
with the wrong hand.</i>

1333
01:21:02,593 --> 01:21:04,322
<i>But not for Leigh, right.</i>

1334
01:21:04,428 --> 01:21:06,328
<i>- What do you mean?
- He's ambidextrous.</i>

1335
01:21:06,430 --> 01:21:09,831
<i>He can write with either hand.
Didn't you guys know that?</i>

1336
01:21:09,934 --> 01:21:12,732
<i>In everyday life, Allen uses his left hand.</i>

1337
01:21:12,837 --> 01:21:15,271
<i>Job applications,
letters to friends, et cetera.</i>

1338
01:21:15,372 --> 01:21:18,000
But he writes the Zodiac letters
with his right hand

1339
01:21:18,108 --> 01:21:21,874
producing a different handwriting
that he can't be linked to.

1340
01:21:22,346 --> 01:21:23,677
<i>We got to see this guy, Chief.</i>

1341
01:21:23,781 --> 01:21:24,975
- Where is he?
- Vallejo.

1342
01:21:25,082 --> 01:21:28,142
<i>He works at Union Oil in Pinole.
His brother's up there, too.</i>

1343
01:21:28,252 --> 01:21:29,685
See them both.

1344
01:21:29,787 --> 01:21:32,255
Make sure you call Mulanax.
It is his backyard.

1345
01:21:32,356 --> 01:21:35,519
<i>Oh, right, because that
worked so well for us in Riverside.</i>

1346
01:21:35,626 --> 01:21:38,186
<i>Cooperation, that's us, at all costs.</i>

1347
01:21:47,805 --> 01:21:51,832
<i>You can talk to him in here.
Coke machine's busted, by the way.</i>

1348
01:21:53,010 --> 01:21:54,944
I'll go get him for you.

1349
01:21:56,447 --> 01:21:58,574
So how do you guys wanna do this?

1350
01:21:58,682 --> 01:22:02,311
<i>Well, Bill talked to the informants.
He leads, we follow?</i>

1351
01:22:02,419 --> 01:22:04,011
It's okay by me.

1352
01:22:17,935 --> 01:22:20,495
<i>Mr. Allen, I'm Inspector Bill Armstrong.</i>

1353
01:22:20,604 --> 01:22:23,505
This is Inspector Dave Toschi
and Sergeant Jack Mulanax.

1354
01:22:23,607 --> 01:22:27,976
We're investigating the Zodiac murders
in San Francisco and Vallejo.

1355
01:22:28,078 --> 01:22:29,670
<i>Please, sit down.</i>

1356
01:22:38,555 --> 01:22:41,023
The informant notified us
that you made certain statements

1357
01:22:41,125 --> 01:22:43,685
11 months prior
to the first Zodiac murder.

1358
01:22:43,794 --> 01:22:46,820
<i>If they're true,
they're quite incriminating.</i>

1359
01:22:46,931 --> 01:22:49,161
Do you recall
having any such conversation?

1360
01:22:49,266 --> 01:22:50,358
- No.
- Have you ever read

1361
01:22:50,467 --> 01:22:52,435
or heard anything about the Zodiac?

1362
01:22:52,536 --> 01:22:53,764
When it was first in the paper.

1363
01:22:53,871 --> 01:22:55,930
But I didn't follow it
after those first reports.

1364
01:22:56,040 --> 01:22:58,531
- Why not?
- Too morbid. I...

1365
01:22:59,543 --> 01:23:02,341
I told all this to the other officer.

1366
01:23:02,446 --> 01:23:04,914
- Which other officer?
- From Vallejo.

1367
01:23:06,350 --> 01:23:07,783
Do you remember his name?

1368
01:23:07,885 --> 01:23:11,582
<i>No, but it was right after
the murder at the lake.</i>

1369
01:23:11,689 --> 01:23:14,157
And what did you tell this officer?

1370
01:23:15,759 --> 01:23:19,957
I told him that I'd gone to Salt Point
that weekend to skin dive.

1371
01:23:20,064 --> 01:23:22,862
That I was alone
but I met a couple there.

1372
01:23:24,068 --> 01:23:26,195
I have their names at home
if you want them.

1373
01:23:26,303 --> 01:23:27,930
<i>That would be great, Arthur.</i>

1374
01:23:28,038 --> 01:23:29,903
- Leigh.
- What?

1375
01:23:30,808 --> 01:23:33,299
Leigh. Nobody calls me Arthur.

1376
01:23:35,079 --> 01:23:38,480
<i>Also, that day when I came home,
my neighbor saw me.</i>

1377
01:23:38,582 --> 01:23:42,348
It was around 4:00. But I forgot
to tell the other officer that.

1378
01:23:42,453 --> 01:23:44,614
- Neighbor's name?
- Bill White.

1379
01:23:46,457 --> 01:23:48,220
He died a week or so afterwards.

1380
01:23:48,325 --> 01:23:51,726
Heart attack.
So I didn't think to call to follow up.

1381
01:23:53,897 --> 01:23:55,990
<i>The knives I had in my car
with the blood on them,</i>

1382
01:23:56,100 --> 01:23:59,627
that blood came from a chicken
that I killed for dinner.

1383
01:24:02,439 --> 01:24:05,237
- What?
- I had knives in my car that weekend.

1384
01:24:05,342 --> 01:24:09,608
Maybe Bill saw them
and called the other officer on me.

1385
01:24:10,247 --> 01:24:13,307
<i>Well, we'll be checking in on that.</i>

1386
01:24:13,417 --> 01:24:14,850
<i>Well, let me ask you something else.</i>

1387
01:24:14,952 --> 01:24:18,888
Were you ever in Southern California
at any time in 1966?

1388
01:24:19,923 --> 01:24:22,414
- Is this about the Riverside killing?
- Yes.

1389
01:24:23,560 --> 01:24:25,790
<i>Well, I guess I was there
around that time.</i>

1390
01:24:25,896 --> 01:24:29,229
I used to go down there a lot.
I like the auto races.

1391
01:24:33,570 --> 01:24:36,004
Informant says that
you're ambidextrous?

1392
01:24:36,106 --> 01:24:38,040
<i>No, that's untrue.</i>

1393
01:24:38,142 --> 01:24:40,440
You can't write with both hands?

1394
01:24:41,612 --> 01:24:44,672
<i>My teachers tried to make me
when I was a kid, but I couldn't.</i>

1395
01:24:44,782 --> 01:24:46,875
I'm left-handed.

1396
01:24:46,984 --> 01:24:51,148
He also said that you made statements
about killing school children.

1397
01:24:51,855 --> 01:24:53,345
That is...

1398
01:24:53,457 --> 01:24:56,722
That is horrible. That is...
That's a horrible thing to say.

1399
01:24:56,827 --> 01:25:00,024
<i>So, you weren't angry
about being fired from Valley Springs</i>

1400
01:25:00,130 --> 01:25:02,325
for touching your students?

1401
01:25:11,608 --> 01:25:13,303
I'm not the Zodiac.

1402
01:25:14,278 --> 01:25:17,247
<i>And if I was, I certainly wouldn't tell you.</i>

1403
01:25:19,516 --> 01:25:21,313
That's a nice watch.

1404
01:25:23,153 --> 01:25:24,177
Thank you.

1405
01:25:24,288 --> 01:25:25,721
May I see it?

1406
01:25:27,658 --> 01:25:29,091
May I see it?

1407
01:25:40,938 --> 01:25:41,996
Where'd you get it?

1408
01:25:42,206 --> 01:25:44,936
It was a Christmas gift
from my mother two years ago.

1409
01:25:45,042 --> 01:25:47,169
That's very sweet.

1410
01:25:47,277 --> 01:25:49,871
<i>So, tell me something, Arthur.</i>

1411
01:25:49,980 --> 01:25:51,004
You don't remember anyone

1412
01:25:51,115 --> 01:25:54,949
you might have had a conversation with
regarding the Zodiac?

1413
01:25:56,120 --> 01:26:01,524
Maybe Ted Kidder or Phil Tucker
at Vallejo Recreation.

1414
01:26:02,826 --> 01:26:04,657
But I couldn't be positive.

1415
01:26:04,761 --> 01:26:06,888
I used to work there when...

1416
01:26:10,567 --> 01:26:12,626
<i>The Most Dangerous Game.</i>

1417
01:26:13,937 --> 01:26:15,029
What?

1418
01:26:15,139 --> 01:26:18,302
<i>The Most Dangerous Game.
That's why you're here, isn't it?</i>

1419
01:26:18,408 --> 01:26:20,137
It was my favorite book in high school.

1420
01:26:20,244 --> 01:26:23,702
It's about this man who waits for people
to get shipwrecked on this island.

1421
01:26:23,814 --> 01:26:25,213
<i>Because he was
tired of hunting animals,</i>

1422
01:26:25,315 --> 01:26:26,907
he hunted the people for the challenge.

1423
01:26:27,017 --> 01:26:31,147
And man is the most
dangerous animal of all?

1424
01:26:31,255 --> 01:26:33,746
That's the whole point of the story.

1425
01:26:34,458 --> 01:26:35,789
Great book.

1426
01:26:37,027 --> 01:26:39,655
<i>Or, at least, that's what I told Phil.</i>

1427
01:26:45,269 --> 01:26:46,497
May I go?

1428
01:26:50,140 --> 01:26:51,198
Sure.

1429
01:26:56,079 --> 01:27:00,345
- Thanks for your time.
- I'm willing to help in any way possible.

1430
01:27:00,450 --> 01:27:02,509
I look forward to the day

1431
01:27:02,619 --> 01:27:06,077
when police officers
are no longer referred to as pigs.

1432
01:27:07,090 --> 01:27:08,250
Thanks.

1433
01:27:09,393 --> 01:27:11,020
We'll be in touch.

1434
01:27:22,806 --> 01:27:26,902
So does anyone think this suspect
warrants further investigation?

1435
01:27:27,010 --> 01:27:29,945
These are copies of some
of the Zodiac letters that were sent.

1436
01:27:30,514 --> 01:27:33,813
We'd like you to take a look at them.

1437
01:27:33,917 --> 01:27:35,782
You think my brother's the Zodiac.

1438
01:27:35,886 --> 01:27:37,854
<i>Well, we're looking at him.</i>

1439
01:27:37,955 --> 01:27:39,320
Are you going to arrest him?

1440
01:27:39,423 --> 01:27:43,359
<i>Mrs. Allen, we don't arrest people
just because we're interested in them.</i>

1441
01:27:43,460 --> 01:27:44,893
<i>Well, Leigh's always been troubled.</i>

1442
01:27:44,995 --> 01:27:47,190
Is it true about the children?

1443
01:27:47,764 --> 01:27:49,197
Unfortunately.

1444
01:27:49,299 --> 01:27:51,893
We don't see him much anymore
since we found out.

1445
01:27:52,002 --> 01:27:54,027
What are your feelings
about Don Cheney?

1446
01:27:54,137 --> 01:27:56,435
Don Cheney? My old roommate?

1447
01:27:56,540 --> 01:27:59,509
- Was he the one who contacted you?
- That's confidential.

1448
01:27:59,610 --> 01:28:01,134
<i>Well, Don's a very reliable guy.</i>

1449
01:28:01,245 --> 01:28:04,305
<i>If he were to tell you something,
I'd believe it to be true.</i>

1450
01:28:04,414 --> 01:28:05,574
- This one.
- What about it?

1451
01:28:05,682 --> 01:28:07,809
<i>Here, where he spells
"Christmas" with two "S's. "</i>

1452
01:28:07,918 --> 01:28:09,852
We got a Christmas card from Leigh
a couple years ago.

1453
01:28:09,953 --> 01:28:12,979
He spelled it the exact same way.
Christ-mass.

1454
01:28:13,090 --> 01:28:15,820
- Would you still have that?
- I can look for it.

1455
01:28:15,926 --> 01:28:18,019
Thank you. That'd be great.

1456
01:28:19,162 --> 01:28:21,187
Is there anything else
we can do to help?

1457
01:28:21,298 --> 01:28:22,925
<i>The brother said
he would search Leigh's apartment</i>

1458
01:28:23,033 --> 01:28:24,261
next time he went out of town.

1459
01:28:24,368 --> 01:28:26,598
- That gets you around a warrant.
- For the time being.

1460
01:28:26,703 --> 01:28:29,934
<i>If we do find something,
Mulanax will go to the DA in Vallejo,</i>

1461
01:28:30,040 --> 01:28:31,769
and we could search the place properly.

1462
01:28:31,875 --> 01:28:33,342
Now I got a chance to talk to the cop

1463
01:28:33,443 --> 01:28:36,310
who interviewed Leigh Allen
two days after the Berryessa murders.

1464
01:28:36,413 --> 01:28:38,108
<i>Doesn't remember how he got onto him,</i>

1465
01:28:38,215 --> 01:28:41,207
but didn't think he looked like a killer
so he didn't like him for Z.

1466
01:28:41,318 --> 01:28:44,151
- But you do?
- I wish I could've taken the guy in there.

1467
01:28:44,254 --> 01:28:47,189
<i>Take it slow, Dave.
Try and find more stuff for Sherwood.</i>

1468
01:28:47,291 --> 01:28:49,316
A match'll get us farther
on the warrants.

1469
01:28:49,426 --> 01:28:52,520
- Avery's on two.
- Tell him to screw.

1470
01:28:52,629 --> 01:28:56,929
You want me to communicate that
verbatim or can I spice it up a little?

1471
01:29:06,743 --> 01:29:08,176
<i>Christ, kid.</i>

1472
01:29:09,846 --> 01:29:10,778
Yeah.

1473
01:29:10,881 --> 01:29:13,179
<i>- Paul, I've been thinking...
- Oh, God save us all.</i>

1474
01:29:13,283 --> 01:29:14,648
The letter to Melvin Belli

1475
01:29:14,751 --> 01:29:17,686
was sent exactly one year
after the Lake Herman Road murder.

1476
01:29:17,788 --> 01:29:19,517
And the one to Cheri Jo Bates' father

1477
01:29:19,623 --> 01:29:21,989
was sent exactly six months
after her death.

1478
01:29:22,092 --> 01:29:24,390
- She was killed a day before Halloween.
- Yeah.

1479
01:29:24,494 --> 01:29:25,984
And you received a Halloween card...

1480
01:29:26,096 --> 01:29:28,690
<i>You know, these are all fascinating
pieces of news, Robert,</i>

1481
01:29:28,799 --> 01:29:30,733
it's a bit early in the day.

1482
01:29:30,834 --> 01:29:33,667
<i>Paul, it's 11:00 and we missed Editorial.</i>

1483
01:29:38,275 --> 01:29:40,300
<i>- I'm sorry. I didn't mean to wake you up.
- No, no, no.</i>

1484
01:29:40,410 --> 01:29:41,604
<i>- I just thought that...
- No, no, no.</i>

1485
01:29:47,246 --> 01:29:49,578
This suspect is not your Zodiac.

1486
01:29:51,684 --> 01:29:54,209
This sample matches the canceled
checks and the application?

1487
01:29:54,320 --> 01:29:55,309
Perfectly.

1488
01:29:55,421 --> 01:29:58,618
<i>So we've just retested the left hand.
I mean, we know he's ambidextrous.</i>

1489
01:29:58,724 --> 01:30:01,955
<i>In 38 years, I've never seen anyone
that ambidextrous.</i>

1490
01:30:02,061 --> 01:30:04,552
Both hands would have commonalities.

1491
01:30:04,930 --> 01:30:06,192
I'm sorry.

1492
01:30:06,699 --> 01:30:08,428
Just not gonna work.

1493
01:30:10,369 --> 01:30:12,769
<i>- Homicide, Toschi.
- Dave, it's Jack Mulanax.</i>

1494
01:30:12,872 --> 01:30:14,999
Hey. Mulanax. Yeah.

1495
01:30:15,107 --> 01:30:16,506
<i>We struck out with the judge.</i>

1496
01:30:16,609 --> 01:30:18,236
<i>He won't sign off on a warrant
for Allen's house.</i>

1497
01:30:18,344 --> 01:30:20,369
- Why not?
- Said it wasn't enough.

1498
01:30:20,479 --> 01:30:22,811
<i>Now, unless we bring him a handwriting
match or some evidence that...</i>

1499
01:30:22,915 --> 01:30:25,281
How are we gonna get evidence
if we can't toss the house?

1500
01:30:25,384 --> 01:30:26,817
<i>I don't know.</i>

1501
01:30:27,386 --> 01:30:30,287
<i>- I truly am sorry.
- No, no. Thank you, Jack.</i>

1502
01:30:32,191 --> 01:30:33,249
What do you wanna do?

1503
01:30:33,359 --> 01:30:34,690
Don't know what I can do
without Vallejo.

1504
01:30:34,793 --> 01:30:37,626
We need Allen's right hand.
We can't get it without a warrant.

1505
01:30:37,730 --> 01:30:39,823
Are there other guys
you should be looking at?

1506
01:30:39,932 --> 01:30:41,866
<i>Only, what?</i>

1507
01:30:41,967 --> 01:30:43,867
Twenty-three hundred?

1508
01:30:43,969 --> 01:30:45,300
<i>Okay, then.</i>

1509
01:30:48,474 --> 01:30:49,805
<i>Okay, then.</i>

1510
01:31:17,736 --> 01:31:20,398
<i>Paul, you wrote the Justice Department</i>

1511
01:31:20,506 --> 01:31:23,839
asking to be put in charge
of the Zodiac investigation?

1512
01:31:25,878 --> 01:31:27,778
I merely suggested...

1513
01:31:27,880 --> 01:31:29,074
On our letterhead?

1514
01:31:29,181 --> 01:31:31,206
...that those with intimate knowledge
of the case

1515
01:31:31,317 --> 01:31:33,251
create an information clearinghouse

1516
01:31:33,352 --> 01:31:35,479
to promote an exchange
and free flow of ideas.

1517
01:31:35,587 --> 01:31:38,647
<i>- And that you run it.
- Well, who better than me?</i>

1518
01:31:39,725 --> 01:31:41,249
The marked man.

1519
01:31:41,994 --> 01:31:43,928
<i>Paul, if you want to work here,
I need three things.</i>

1520
01:31:44,029 --> 01:31:45,496
<i>One, stop boozing.</i>

1521
01:31:45,597 --> 01:31:48,760
<i>Two, stop doing
whatever else it is you're doing.</i>

1522
01:31:48,867 --> 01:31:52,359
<i>And three, cut this nonsense out.</i>

1523
01:31:52,471 --> 01:31:55,531
<i>Sweetest of Templetons, if at any time</i>

1524
01:31:55,641 --> 01:32:00,840
<i>you feel my excellent work is no longer
in step with this trashy provincial rag,</i>

1525
01:32:00,946 --> 01:32:02,607
I'll more than happily...

1526
01:32:02,715 --> 01:32:06,173
More than happily
decamp for greener pastures.

1527
01:32:06,285 --> 01:32:07,877
<i>Paul, I mean it!</i>

1528
01:32:18,097 --> 01:32:19,962
- Paul?
- Yep.

1529
01:32:20,065 --> 01:32:23,262
- What was that?
- An editorial tte--tte.

1530
01:32:24,436 --> 01:32:26,529
- Wanna grab a drink?
- It's 10:00 in the morning.

1531
01:32:26,638 --> 01:32:28,435
Late breakfast?

1532
01:32:29,475 --> 01:32:31,568
<i>- Early lunch, or...
- Paul.</i>

1533
01:32:34,079 --> 01:32:35,512
Are you okay?

1534
01:32:36,382 --> 01:32:37,406
No.

1535
01:32:40,853 --> 01:32:42,650
Thank you for asking.

1536
01:32:44,890 --> 01:32:47,017
Shorty! Let's go out for one.

1537
01:32:47,126 --> 01:32:49,117
<i>Paul, where are you going?</i>

1538
01:32:51,196 --> 01:32:52,754
<i>So, you moved off my brother-in-law?</i>

1539
01:32:53,766 --> 01:32:55,700
We couldn't get a warrant.

1540
01:32:57,369 --> 01:33:00,770
Last year we arranged for Leigh
to get help from a social worker.

1541
01:33:00,873 --> 01:33:02,500
He only went twice.

1542
01:33:02,608 --> 01:33:05,577
We saw him recently for
the first time in nine months.

1543
01:33:05,677 --> 01:33:08,805
My mother-in-law brought him by
to see the new baby.

1544
01:33:08,914 --> 01:33:12,213
<i>After he left,
I went to see that social worker.</i>

1545
01:33:12,317 --> 01:33:15,650
<i>He couldn't talk about a former patient,
so I just asked him straight out</i>

1546
01:33:15,754 --> 01:33:17,915
if he thought Leigh
was capable of killing people.

1547
01:33:18,023 --> 01:33:21,254
- Because of patient confidentiality...
- The man said yes.

1548
01:33:23,095 --> 01:33:25,256
Why hadn't you seen him
in nine months?

1549
01:33:25,364 --> 01:33:27,264
He's going to school in Santa Rosa.

1550
01:33:27,366 --> 01:33:30,699
- Santa Rosa? Where is he living?
- In his trailer.

1551
01:33:30,803 --> 01:33:32,828
- In Santa Rosa?
- Sonoma County.

1552
01:33:32,938 --> 01:33:35,133
We wouldn't have to go
through the Vallejo DA.

1553
01:33:35,240 --> 01:33:36,730
<i>It's been 11 months
since you talked to this guy,</i>

1554
01:33:36,842 --> 01:33:38,366
and now you wanna search his trailer?

1555
01:33:38,477 --> 01:33:40,240
<i>If we find something, great.</i>

1556
01:33:40,345 --> 01:33:43,508
<i>If not, we get his prints and
handwriting samples from both hands.</i>

1557
01:33:43,615 --> 01:33:45,981
I thought Sherwood shut you down.

1558
01:33:46,718 --> 01:33:49,186
What if I can get a second opinion?

1559
01:33:50,355 --> 01:33:52,346
I don't wanna step on Sherwood's toes.
He trained me at this.

1560
01:33:52,458 --> 01:33:55,222
<i>Terry, all I need to know
is if the suspect is ambidextrous.</i>

1561
01:33:55,327 --> 01:33:59,286
Could he possibly have written
those letters with his other hand?

1562
01:34:00,999 --> 01:34:02,364
Between you and me?

1563
01:34:02,468 --> 01:34:05,904
Because there are differing
schools of thought on this.

1564
01:34:07,106 --> 01:34:11,543
<i>Get the samples of his other hand.
If he's the Zodiac, you'll get a match.</i>

1565
01:34:11,643 --> 01:34:14,203
<i>That's the current thinking,
according to Terry Pascoe.</i>

1566
01:34:14,313 --> 01:34:17,578
<i>Meanwhile, I spoke to a psychologist
who'd be willing to testify</i>

1567
01:34:17,683 --> 01:34:20,652
that someone who undergoes
a personality change like Zodiac

1568
01:34:20,752 --> 01:34:23,687
<i>would manifest it physically,
altering his handwriting.</i>

1569
01:34:23,789 --> 01:34:27,384
Which is why Sherwood couldn't
get a match from Allen's samples.

1570
01:34:27,493 --> 01:34:29,723
<i>We got Terry Pascoe,
this psychology guy,</i>

1571
01:34:29,828 --> 01:34:31,159
coupled with Cheney...

1572
01:34:31,263 --> 01:34:32,730
It could be enough for a warrant.

1573
01:34:32,831 --> 01:34:33,957
Get Cheney on the record.

1574
01:34:34,233 --> 01:34:37,293
"And that he would call himself Zodiac. "

1575
01:34:38,403 --> 01:34:39,427
Yes.

1576
01:34:39,538 --> 01:34:43,099
<i>And you're willing to swear
to this, under oath, in Superior Court?</i>

1577
01:34:43,208 --> 01:34:44,607
Without any hesitation.

1578
01:34:44,710 --> 01:34:46,871
<i>Thank you very much, Mr. Cheney.
Thank you very much for your time.</i>

1579
01:34:46,979 --> 01:34:47,968
Thank you.

1580
01:34:48,080 --> 01:34:49,877
Suspect is Arthur Leigh Allen.

1581
01:34:49,982 --> 01:34:53,713
<i>Lives in Sunset Trailer Court
in Santa Rosa, California.</i>

1582
01:34:53,819 --> 01:34:55,411
Physical description.

1583
01:34:55,521 --> 01:34:57,716
<i>Allen is similar in height,
weight and build</i>

1584
01:34:57,823 --> 01:35:00,917
to a man seen at Lake Berryessa
on the day of the stabbings.

1585
01:35:01,026 --> 01:35:03,824
<i>I understand he doesn't look
much like the San Francisco composite.</i>

1586
01:35:03,929 --> 01:35:05,453
<i>True. Height and weight are sketchy,</i>

1587
01:35:05,564 --> 01:35:07,759
but lumbering Caucasian
with a crew cut is right on.

1588
01:35:07,866 --> 01:35:10,164
We never had much confidence
in the composite from the kids.

1589
01:35:10,269 --> 01:35:12,260
The patrolman
who saw Zodiac that night

1590
01:35:12,371 --> 01:35:13,838
said he didn't look much like the sketch.

1591
01:35:13,939 --> 01:35:15,406
Military boot prints.

1592
01:35:15,507 --> 01:35:18,237
Allen was in the Navy.
Wears a size 10-and-a-half.

1593
01:35:18,343 --> 01:35:20,777
Same size as the prints
found at Berryessa.

1594
01:35:20,879 --> 01:35:22,574
<i>What about gun?</i>

1595
01:35:22,681 --> 01:35:27,243
Cheney says Allen owns several
firearms. We'll list them in the warrant.

1596
01:35:27,352 --> 01:35:30,116
<i>- And the ciphers.
- Could be code training in the Navy,</i>

1597
01:35:30,222 --> 01:35:32,918
and people have seen Allen
with ciphers in the past.

1598
01:35:33,025 --> 01:35:34,049
<i>Really? Who?</i>

1599
01:35:34,159 --> 01:35:36,957
That would be his sister-in-law
and a man named Phil Tucker

1600
01:35:37,062 --> 01:35:39,360
that he worked with
at a public pool in Vallejo.

1601
01:35:39,464 --> 01:35:42,922
And Phil Tucker told us about
a conversation that he had with Allen

1602
01:35:43,035 --> 01:35:45,731
about how to attach a flashlight
to the barrel of a gun.

1603
01:35:45,837 --> 01:35:49,068
That gives us two sources
on the ciphers and two on the flashlight.

1604
01:35:49,174 --> 01:35:51,165
<i>What about his threats on children?</i>

1605
01:35:51,276 --> 01:35:53,039
Suspect worked for elementary schools

1606
01:35:53,145 --> 01:35:56,342
<i>and was fired for molestation
in March, April '68.</i>

1607
01:35:56,448 --> 01:35:59,076
<i>- Could give him motive.
- At the very least, it's home turf.</i>

1608
01:35:59,184 --> 01:36:01,243
<i>He'd have knowledge of bus routes,</i>

1609
01:36:01,353 --> 01:36:03,787
which the two major threats
centered around.

1610
01:36:03,889 --> 01:36:05,584
<i>What about the bomb?</i>

1611
01:36:07,025 --> 01:36:08,993
Allen works as a chemist.

1612
01:36:09,094 --> 01:36:10,527
Take him through the geography.

1613
01:36:10,629 --> 01:36:12,096
Vallejo murders.

1614
01:36:12,197 --> 01:36:15,689
Allen lives in Vallejo
with his mother in her basement.

1615
01:36:15,801 --> 01:36:18,964
Berryessa murder. On the day
that the two kids were stabbed

1616
01:36:19,071 --> 01:36:21,733
his neighbor saw bloody knives
in his truck

1617
01:36:21,840 --> 01:36:24,741
which he claimed were used
to kill a chicken.

1618
01:36:24,843 --> 01:36:26,674
<i>Does he have any alibis?</i>

1619
01:36:26,778 --> 01:36:29,440
<i>He claimed he did, but he's been unable
to produce the names</i>

1620
01:36:29,548 --> 01:36:32,813
of the couple he supposedly met
on the day of Berryessa.

1621
01:36:32,918 --> 01:36:35,284
The bottom line is that Allen
can't alibi up on anything.

1622
01:36:35,387 --> 01:36:37,184
<i>Riverside, Vallejo, the lake or us.</i>

1623
01:36:37,289 --> 01:36:39,484
<i>- You want to tell me about the name?
- What name?</i>

1624
01:36:39,591 --> 01:36:40,683
Zodiac.

1625
01:36:40,792 --> 01:36:44,660
Allen wears a watch that bears
both the word and crosshair symbol.

1626
01:36:44,763 --> 01:36:46,128
And he mentioned Zodiac to Cheney

1627
01:36:46,231 --> 01:36:48,756
a year and a half
before it appeared in any letter.

1628
01:36:51,970 --> 01:36:54,404
<i>- John...
- That's pretty good, guys.</i>

1629
01:36:54,506 --> 01:36:57,475
<i>- We think so, too.
- Let's take it to a judge.</i>

1630
01:37:17,696 --> 01:37:18,958
Mr. Allen?

1631
01:37:19,064 --> 01:37:21,055
This is the
Santa Rosa Police Department.

1632
01:37:21,166 --> 01:37:23,964
We have a warrant
to search your residence.

1633
01:37:35,013 --> 01:37:36,139
Hello?

1634
01:37:44,890 --> 01:37:47,120
I'll check with the neighbors.

1635
01:37:48,427 --> 01:37:49,451
Close the door.

1636
01:37:49,561 --> 01:37:52,587
<i>Close the door,
there's rodents running around.</i>

1637
01:38:04,976 --> 01:38:07,467
Neighbor said he tore out of here
about a half-hour ago.

1638
01:38:07,579 --> 01:38:11,879
- You think somebody tipped him?
- We're not leaving till he comes back.

1639
01:38:17,756 --> 01:38:19,485
I'll check the back.

1640
01:38:32,237 --> 01:38:33,226
Jesus.

1641
01:38:33,338 --> 01:38:34,930
- What?
- Squirrels.

1642
01:38:37,109 --> 01:38:39,043
<i>Piece of work, this guy.</i>

1643
01:38:45,984 --> 01:38:48,646
<i>Not one, but two blue windbreakers.</i>

1644
01:38:48,754 --> 01:38:52,417
- Like the Stine scene?
- We'll have those checked for blood.

1645
01:38:52,924 --> 01:38:55,825
And a pair of black gloves.

1646
01:38:57,195 --> 01:39:00,460
<i>Men's seven,
just like the ones we found in the cab.</i>

1647
01:39:00,565 --> 01:39:03,090
<i>Well, he's got the same size shoes
and gloves as Z.</i>

1648
01:39:03,201 --> 01:39:05,635
Probably just a coincidence.

1649
01:39:05,737 --> 01:39:09,571
<i>Dave, I got a gun.
Check that. Two guns.</i>

1650
01:39:10,776 --> 01:39:14,007
<i>They're both. 22s.
One automatic, one revolver.</i>

1651
01:39:14,112 --> 01:39:15,602
<i>Well, that's interesting.</i>

1652
01:39:15,714 --> 01:39:18,842
Because he happens to have
an M-1 rifle here in the closet.

1653
01:39:18,950 --> 01:39:21,544
For little darlings bouncing off buses.

1654
01:39:23,054 --> 01:39:24,544
Someone's here.

1655
01:39:31,530 --> 01:39:33,930
<i>Hello, Arthur. Remember us?</i>

1656
01:39:56,521 --> 01:39:57,579
No.

1657
01:39:57,689 --> 01:39:58,747
On the handwriting?

1658
01:39:58,857 --> 01:40:02,349
<i>Ballistics, no match.
Prints, no match. Writing, no match.</i>

1659
01:40:02,461 --> 01:40:04,190
<i>On both hands, right?</i>

1660
01:40:04,296 --> 01:40:06,093
Because we got handwriting
from both his hands.

1661
01:40:06,198 --> 01:40:07,529
And neither hand matches.

1662
01:40:07,632 --> 01:40:09,259
Forget Sherwood.
Let's get another opinion.

1663
01:40:09,367 --> 01:40:11,358
<i>Fellas, he's not your guy.</i>

1664
01:40:18,076 --> 01:40:19,270
Damn it.

1665
01:40:26,451 --> 01:40:27,475
Hey.

1666
01:40:28,353 --> 01:40:30,913
What do you want? Time off?

1667
01:40:33,124 --> 01:40:34,250
A hug?

1668
01:40:35,160 --> 01:40:37,094
Do you know what
the worst part of this is?

1669
01:40:37,195 --> 01:40:39,095
I can't tell if I wanted it
to be Allen so bad

1670
01:40:39,197 --> 01:40:42,462
<i>because I actually thought it was him,
or I just want all this to be over.</i>

1671
01:40:42,567 --> 01:40:44,467
It's because you thought it was him.

1672
01:40:44,569 --> 01:40:46,059
<i>And I did, too.</i>

1673
01:40:48,907 --> 01:40:50,306
You know what? Take some time off.

1674
01:40:50,408 --> 01:40:53,673
Spend some time with your wife
and the kids.

1675
01:40:53,778 --> 01:40:56,303
Go to Candlestick. See a movie.

1676
01:40:57,649 --> 01:41:02,951
<i>"To the city of San Francisco,
I will enjoy killing one person every day</i>

I've got to get out of here.

1686
01:41:30,782 --> 01:41:34,047
<i>Where the hell does he expect me
to find $100,000?</i>

1687
01:41:34,152 --> 01:41:36,518
<i>You're not thinking of paying him,

1688
01:41:36,621 --> 01:41:40,921
<i>The city of San Francisco does not
pay criminals not to commit a crime.</i>

1689

The killer gets shot in the chest.

1690
01:42:06,451 --> 01:42:08,715
That's how it ends.

1691
01:42:09,187 --> 01:42:10,779
Do I know you?

1692
01:42:10,889 --> 01:42:13,653
<i>I'm Robert Graysmith.

Dave Toschi. Nice to meet you.

1694
01:42:15,427 --> 01:42:17,918
Dave! That Harry Callahan
did a hell of a job with your case.

1695
01:42:18,029 --> 01:42:20,623
<i>Yeah. No need for due process, right?</i>

1696
01:42:24,970 --> 01:42:26,961
<i>- What do you do at the Chronicle?
- I'm a cartoonist.</i>

1697
01:42:27,072 --> 01:42:28,369
That's nice.

1698
01:42:28,473 --> 01:42:30,373
You're gonna catch him.

1699
01:42:32,043 --> 01:42:34,841

making movies about it.</i>

1718
01:43:52,223 --> 01:43:54,350
Hi. We haven't met.

1719
01:43:54,459 --> 01:43:56,427
I'm Robert Graysmith.

1720
01:43:56,528 --> 01:43:58,393
I'm Duffy Jennings.

1721
01:43:58,496 --> 01:44:01,590
<i>- Nice to meet you.
- Good to meet you, man.</i>

1722
01:44:01,700 --> 01:44:02,792
You got a great desk.

1723
01:44:02,901 --> 01:44:04,926
Guy who used to work here
was a great reporter.

1724
01:44:05,036 --> 01:44:06,298
<i>Oh, yeah. Oh, I'm sure he was.</i>

1725
01:44:06,404 --> 01:44:08,872
<i>I mean, it's a honor
to leave the Chronicle</i>

1726
01:44:08,973 --> 01:44:11,771
<i>and go work for the Sacramento Bee.</i>

1727

<i>Dare to dream, right, Robert?</i>

1728
01:44:17,716 --> 01:44:20,583
<i>- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you, too.</i>

1729
01:44:20,685 --> 01:44:22,778
I'm just right down there
at the Art department

1730
01:44:22,887 --> 01:44:25,355
<i>- if you need anything, Duffy.
- Yeah.</i>

1731
01:44:28,893 --> 01:44:30,227
<i>- You sure you don't want the car, Bill?
- It's your turn.</i>

1732
01:44:30,262 --> 01:44:31,562
<i>- You sure you don't want the car, Bill?
- It's your turn.</i>

1733
01:44:31,663 --> 01:44:34,826
You could just drop me off at my place
and take the car.

1734
01:44:34,933 --> 01:44:36,867
You should keep the car.

1735
01:44:37,635 --> 01:44:38,693
Yeah?

1736
01:44:39,270 --> 01:44:41,329
I'm not coming in tomorrow.

1737
01:44:43,308 --> 01:44:44,798
Why? What's up?

1738
01:44:46,044 --> 01:44:47,272
I'm done.

1739
01:44:48,813 --> 01:44:50,747
I put in for a transfer.

1740
01:44:56,788 --> 01:44:58,016
Where?

1741
01:44:58,456 --> 01:45:00,048
Looking at Fraud.

1742
01:45:02,293 --> 01:45:04,352
I can't be on call anymore.

1743
01:45:07,165 --> 01:45:09,429
I wanna see these kids grow up.

1744
01:45:10,602 --> 01:45:12,832
<i>Hey, good for you, Bill.</i>

1745
01:45:14,739 --> 01:45:17,230
- You'll be okay.
- Yeah. I'll be fine.

1746
01:45:19,310 --> 01:45:20,334
<i>Hey,</i>

1747
01:45:21,446 --> 01:45:24,847
<i>I'm not leaving you
holding the bag on anything, am I?</i>

1748
01:45:26,551 --> 01:45:27,575
No.

1749
01:45:29,954 --> 01:45:31,012
Okay.

1750
01:45:31,689 --> 01:45:33,384
<i>Hey, you know what?</i>

1751
01:45:34,025 --> 01:45:38,223
<i>Maybe you'll have a chance
to try your Japanese food, the raw stuff.</i>

1752
01:45:39,230 --> 01:45:40,288
Yeah.

1753
01:46:12,297 --> 01:46:13,992
I'm not Paul Avery.

1754
01:46:16,901 --> 01:46:19,836
<i>The boys need to be tucked in, please,
and the baby needs changing.</i>

1755
01:46:19,938 --> 01:46:22,236
- I'll flip you for it.
- You wish.

1756
01:46:25,710 --> 01:46:28,372
Nobody has more Zodiac crap
than you do.

1757
01:47:13,091 --> 01:47:15,286
<i>- Are you kidding me?
- Hi, Paul.</i>

1758
01:47:17,061 --> 01:47:19,723
Permission to come aboard.
It's right there.

1759
01:47:19,831 --> 01:47:22,299
<i>Anyway, you got shoes on.
This is perfect right here.</i>

1760
01:47:22,400 --> 01:47:24,300
- That's the one.
- Okay.

1761
01:47:26,037 --> 01:47:28,835
<i>- See that? Mesmerizing.
- Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.</i>

1762
01:47:28,940 --> 01:47:31,568
My own kids
would kill me for one of those.

1763
01:47:33,444 --> 01:47:35,674
- How are you?
- Fantastic.

1764
01:47:35,780 --> 01:47:37,907
<i>I mean, admittedly,</i>

1765
01:47:38,016 --> 01:47:40,348
<i>the Bee ain't exactly
the Chron, but fuck it, right?</i>

1766
01:47:40,451 --> 01:47:43,352
<i>Do you want a drink?
I don't have anything blue, but I got...</i>

1767
01:47:43,454 --> 01:47:45,422
Don't worry about that.
Don't worry about it.

1768
01:47:45,523 --> 01:47:49,084
It's no bother at all.
Nobody comes by from the old days.

1769
01:47:49,494 --> 01:47:50,518
Cheers.

1770
01:47:51,296 --> 01:47:53,423
To your health and mine.

1771
01:47:55,366 --> 01:47:56,731
Mostly mine.

1772
01:48:01,940 --> 01:48:03,430
<i>So,</i>

1773
01:48:05,643 --> 01:48:06,974
what's new?

1774
01:48:09,013 --> 01:48:10,913
- I've been thinking.
- Yeah.

1775
01:48:11,015 --> 01:48:12,141
Somebody should write a book.

1776
01:48:12,250 --> 01:48:15,185
<i>Somebody should write a fucking book,
that's for sure.</i>

1777
01:48:15,286 --> 01:48:17,413
- About what?
- About Zodiac.

1778
01:48:19,057 --> 01:48:20,456
It's not new.

1779
01:48:20,558 --> 01:48:25,188
<i>I've been thinking that
if you put all the information together,</i>

1780
01:48:25,296 --> 01:48:26,854
maybe you could jog something loose.

1781
01:48:26,965 --> 01:48:29,456
And then I was thinking that
nobody knows the case better than you.

1782
01:48:29,567 --> 01:48:30,591
Yeah. That's true.

1783
01:48:30,702 --> 01:48:33,694
<i>You know all the players,
and you have all the files.</i>

1784
01:48:33,805 --> 01:48:35,102
Lost them.

1785
01:48:35,440 --> 01:48:36,498
You lost them?

1786
01:48:36,607 --> 01:48:39,872
Or I tossed them. I don't know.
I moved onto a boat.

1787
01:48:40,311 --> 01:48:42,370
<i>You know that we work
in the daily business, right?</i>

1788
01:48:42,480 --> 01:48:43,742
<i>As in, today.</i>

1789
01:48:43,848 --> 01:48:46,612
What do you think
we were doing back then?

1790
01:48:47,618 --> 01:48:49,745
Do you know that more people die
in the East Bay commute

1791
01:48:49,854 --> 01:48:52,152
every three months
than that idiot ever killed?

1792
01:48:52,256 --> 01:48:53,416
<i>He offed a few citizens,</i>

1793
01:48:53,524 --> 01:48:56,857
<i>he wrote a few letters,
and he faded into a footnote.</i>

1794
01:49:02,367 --> 01:49:05,359
Not that I haven't been sitting here idly

1795
01:49:05,470 --> 01:49:09,429
waiting for you to drop by
and reinvigorate my sense of purpose.

1796
01:49:11,776 --> 01:49:14,904
It was four years ago. Let it fucking go.

1797
01:49:15,013 --> 01:49:17,709
You're wrong. It was important.

1798
01:49:18,983 --> 01:49:21,474
<i>Then, what did you ever do about it?</i>

1799
01:49:22,353 --> 01:49:24,480
<i>If it was so fucking important,
what did you ever do?</i>

1800
01:49:24,589 --> 01:49:27,422
<i>You hovered over my desk,
you stole from wastebaskets.</i>

1801
01:49:27,525 --> 01:49:29,152
Am I being unkind?

1802
01:49:30,328 --> 01:49:33,593
<i>Oh, that's right, I forgot.
You went to the library.</i>

1803
01:49:36,401 --> 01:49:38,369
I'm sorry I bothered you.

1804
01:50:00,491 --> 01:50:02,516
<i>- Hey, hi.
- Hi.</i>

1805
01:50:02,627 --> 01:50:05,061
- Where you been?
- The library.

1806
01:50:36,727 --> 01:50:38,024
Thank you!

1807
01:50:53,778 --> 01:50:57,145
<i>- Inspector Toschi?
- Yeah? One moment, please.</i>

1808
01:51:01,519 --> 01:51:02,713
- Hi.
- Hi.

1809
01:51:04,021 --> 01:51:06,012
We met at the movies once.

1810
01:51:06,524 --> 01:51:07,889
It must have been magical.

1811
01:51:07,992 --> 01:51:09,721
<i>I'm Robert Graysmith.
I work at the Chronicle.</i>

1812
01:51:09,827 --> 01:51:11,209
I was wondering if I could buy you lunch.

1813
01:51:11,244 --> 01:51:12,592
I was wondering if I could buy you lunch.

1814
01:51:14,332 --> 01:51:15,993
<i>Sure, why not?</i>

1815
01:51:16,100 --> 01:51:18,466
<i>So, you're a friend of Paul Avery's?</i>

1816
01:51:18,569 --> 01:51:20,969
He's actually the reason I'm here.

1817
01:51:22,707 --> 01:51:25,073
I wanted to ask you about Zodiac.

1818
01:51:25,543 --> 01:51:28,774
<i>Well, I appreciate the interest,
but we don't discuss open cases.</i>

1819
01:51:28,880 --> 01:51:31,405
<i>Oh, well, what's going on with it,
day to day?</i>

1820
01:51:31,516 --> 01:51:33,177
We're actively pursuing all leads.

1821
01:51:33,284 --> 01:51:35,844
<i>And you're the only one on it, right?</i>

1822
01:51:37,021 --> 01:51:38,488
<i>Mr. Graysmith,</i>

1823
01:51:39,624 --> 01:51:41,592
Zodiac hasn't written in three years.

1824
01:51:41,692 --> 01:51:44,422
You know how many murders
we've had in San Francisco since then?

1825
01:51:44,529 --> 01:51:46,019
- No.
- Over 200.

1826
01:51:46,130 --> 01:51:49,429
That's a lot of dead people
and grieving families that need our help.

1827
01:51:49,534 --> 01:51:51,126
<i>So, nobody cares.</i>

1828
01:51:51,269 --> 01:51:53,703
Excuse me? I care.

1829
01:51:56,407 --> 01:51:58,671
Okay. Can I show you something?

1830
01:52:01,579 --> 01:52:04,742
I've been doing research
on the first cipher.

1831
01:52:04,849 --> 01:52:06,612
Everything an amateur
would need to create it

1832
01:52:06,717 --> 01:52:09,686
can be found in these books.

1833
01:52:09,787 --> 01:52:13,120
<i>Now, I started thinking
that if you can track these books,</i>

1834
01:52:13,224 --> 01:52:15,624
then maybe you can track the man.

1835
01:52:16,160 --> 01:52:18,993
<i>So, I remember you thought
that Zodiac was military,</i>

1836
01:52:19,096 --> 01:52:22,759
so I went to every base library
and I got a list of every person

1837
01:52:22,867 --> 01:52:26,803
who's ever checked out these books
and that's when I found this.

1838
01:52:31,542 --> 01:52:34,033
- Missing.
- It means they were stolen.

1839
01:52:34,845 --> 01:52:38,406
<i>So, almost every book on ciphers
was stolen from the Presidio Library?</i>

1840
01:52:38,516 --> 01:52:41,110
And the Oakland Army Terminal Library.

1841
01:52:43,921 --> 01:52:48,358
Somebody didn't want a record
of ever having checked out these books.

1842
01:52:48,459 --> 01:52:50,086
Who are you again?

1843
01:52:52,196 --> 01:52:53,823
I just wanna help.

1844
01:52:57,034 --> 01:52:59,298
I can't allow you to help.

1845
01:52:59,403 --> 01:53:01,166
I can't discuss the case with you.

1846
01:53:01,272 --> 01:53:03,706
<i>I can't give you information,
and I certainly couldn't tell you</i>

1847
01:53:03,808 --> 01:53:06,003
to go see Ken Narlow in Napa.

1848
01:53:06,577 --> 01:53:07,942
N- A-R-L-O-W.

1849
01:53:17,955 --> 01:53:22,619
<i>I'm sorry, Mr. Graysmith,
but we don't cooperate with writers.</i>

1850
01:53:22,727 --> 01:53:25,491
<i>Well, I'm not a writer, I'm a cartoonist.</i>

1851
01:53:26,430 --> 01:53:28,625
- And Dave Toschi sent you?
- Yes.

1852
01:53:28,733 --> 01:53:30,701
- Why?
- Maybe he...

1853
01:53:30,801 --> 01:53:33,599
Maybe he thought
that I could do some good.

1854
01:53:34,338 --> 01:53:38,502
<i>- What are you, some kind of boy scout?
- Eagle Scout, actually, first class.</i>

1855
01:53:39,477 --> 01:53:42,640
<i>Well, if you wanna do this,
don't let me stop you.</i>

1856
01:53:43,948 --> 01:53:46,007
<i>Better start with Vallejo, Jack Mulanax.</i>

1857
01:53:46,984 --> 01:53:49,384
I understand what you're trying to do.

1858
01:53:49,487 --> 01:53:51,682
But this is an open police investigation.

1859
01:53:51,789 --> 01:53:53,882
I'm a friend of Dave Toschi's.

1860
01:53:53,991 --> 01:53:57,256
And he said
that you might be able to help.

1861
01:53:57,361 --> 01:54:00,262
<i>I mean, the case is dead.
Zodiac's long gone.</i>

1862
01:54:01,198 --> 01:54:03,359
<i>He's yesterday's news, right?</i>

1863
01:54:04,435 --> 01:54:06,198
That's what they say.

1864
01:54:07,138 --> 01:54:08,969
<i>So, what's the harm?</i>

1865
01:54:09,073 --> 01:54:10,506
<i>No pens, no paper.</i>

1866
01:54:11,075 --> 01:54:13,737
<i>Anything that you see that's relevant,
you got to remember in your head.</i>

1867
01:54:13,844 --> 01:54:14,902
Okay.

1868
01:54:17,148 --> 01:54:18,445
<i>Okay, here we go.</i>

1869
01:54:18,549 --> 01:54:20,608
- Which one?
- All of them.

1870
01:54:20,718 --> 01:54:23,414
And there's more in the next room.
They're all marked with these numbers.

1871
01:54:23,521 --> 01:54:24,715
243-146.

1872
01:54:24,822 --> 01:54:26,653
<i>You don't smoke, do you?</i>

1873
01:54:26,757 --> 01:54:28,850
Once. In high school.

1874
01:54:32,263 --> 01:54:33,628
What's this?

1875
01:54:34,565 --> 01:54:35,862
Thank you.

1876
01:55:04,095 --> 01:55:06,086
<i>Man, you really creeped us out.</i>

1877
01:55:11,969 --> 01:55:13,960
<i>"Nine millimeter.</i>

1878
01:55:15,539 --> 01:55:18,064
<i>"Said nothing and began firing. "</i>

1879
01:55:26,884 --> 01:55:28,181
"Most Dangerous Game.

1880
01:55:28,285 --> 01:55:31,049
<i>"Do not eliminate this suspect
because of handwriting.</i>

1881
01:55:31,155 --> 01:55:33,248
<i>"Not because of handwriting.</i>

1882
01:55:33,824 --> 01:55:35,792
<i>"Darlene's sister, Linda.</i>

1883
01:55:35,893 --> 01:55:38,555
"It was all just deep breathing. George.

1884
01:55:39,196 --> 01:55:41,960
"It was a strange man. George.
Strange man. "

1885
01:55:42,933 --> 01:55:44,560
Thank you so much.

1886
01:55:46,470 --> 01:55:48,461
<i>Oh, briefcase. Oh, thanks.</i>

1887
01:55:51,175 --> 01:55:53,700
<i>- Hey, Jack.
- Hey, Bawart.</i>

1888
01:55:53,811 --> 01:55:55,642
- Who's that?
- That's Graysmith.

1889
01:55:55,746 --> 01:55:59,011
Some cartoonist.
Thinks he's gonna solve the Zodiac.

1890
01:56:00,718 --> 01:56:02,015
<i>Well, good for him.</i>

1891
01:56:32,483 --> 01:56:34,747
<i>- Thank you for meeting me, Inspector.
- No. We're not meeting, Robert.</i>

1892
01:56:34,852 --> 01:56:36,376
We're just two guys
who happen to be sitting

1893
01:56:36,487 --> 01:56:37,647
on the same bench at the same time.

1894
01:56:37,755 --> 01:56:40,155
I've got five minutes.
I've got to get back to the Hall.

1895
01:56:40,257 --> 01:56:42,987
<i>Okay. As far as you know,
did anyone ever get in touch</i>

1896
01:56:43,093 --> 01:56:44,788
with Mike Mageau
during your investigation

1897
01:56:44,895 --> 01:56:47,363
- and show him suspect photos?
- Why?

1898
01:56:47,465 --> 01:56:49,899
<i>Well, he's the only surviving victim
who ever saw Zodiac without a mask.</i>

1899
01:56:50,000 --> 01:56:51,331
<i>No, I mean, why are you asking me?</i>

1900
01:56:51,435 --> 01:56:53,300
<i>Mageau and Darlene,
that's Vallejo's case.</i>

1901
01:56:53,404 --> 01:56:56,168
Paul Stine is mine.
You've got four minutes now.

1902
01:56:56,273 --> 01:56:58,571
Darlene Ferrin was being followed.

1903
01:56:58,676 --> 01:57:00,439
<i>Now, I know Mulanax says
that they already found this guy,</i>

1904
01:57:00,544 --> 01:57:01,533
a George Waters?

1905
01:57:01,645 --> 01:57:03,442
But he also said
that she had a lot of admirers

1906
01:57:03,547 --> 01:57:05,174
who would come to
the restaurant where she worked.

1907
01:57:05,282 --> 01:57:06,874
- She was popular.
- Very.

1908
01:57:06,984 --> 01:57:08,611
Yeah. So...

1909
01:57:08,719 --> 01:57:10,653
<i>She and her husband,
they move into their new house,</i>

1910
01:57:10,754 --> 01:57:12,381
and one night they throw
this painting party.

1911
01:57:12,490 --> 01:57:13,582
And what's a painting party?

1912
01:57:13,691 --> 01:57:15,659
It's a party where people come
and help you paint.

1913
01:57:15,759 --> 01:57:16,851
Sounds like a terrible party.

1914
01:57:16,961 --> 01:57:20,727
<i>Well, supposedly,
somebody who's not Waters shows up.</i>

1915
01:57:20,831 --> 01:57:22,696
And Darlene is terrified of him.

1916
01:57:22,800 --> 01:57:24,529
So you think that Darlene knew Zodiac?

1917
01:57:24,635 --> 01:57:29,095
<i>And if Zodiac knew Darlene,
then maybe Mageau knows Zodiac.</i>

1918
01:57:29,206 --> 01:57:31,037
Maybe. But Mageau's gone.

1919
01:57:31,141 --> 01:57:32,733
<i>So if you wanna connect
Darlene to Zodiac,</i>

1920
01:57:32,843 --> 01:57:34,242
you're gonna have to find another way.

1921
01:57:34,345 --> 01:57:35,676
I have another way.

1922
01:57:35,779 --> 01:57:37,371
Phone calls the night
of Darlene's murder.

1923
01:57:37,481 --> 01:57:40,575
<i>- Yeah, Zodiac called the police.
- No, Dave, there were four other calls.</i>

1924
01:57:40,684 --> 01:57:42,982
<i>There were two to Darlene's house,
one to Darlene's brother-in-law,</i>

1925
01:57:43,087 --> 01:57:45,385
and one to Darlene's father-in-law.
Just heavy breathing.

1926
01:57:45,489 --> 01:57:47,320
<i>They started around 1:30 a. M.,</i>

1927
01:57:47,424 --> 01:57:51,087
and this was before anyone in the family
knew that Darlene had been shot.

1928
01:57:51,195 --> 01:57:53,288
- This was in the Vallejo files?
- Yeah.

1929
01:57:53,397 --> 01:57:54,421
God damn it.

1930
01:57:54,532 --> 01:57:56,261
<i>It's got to be more
than just a coincidence, right?</i>

1931
01:57:56,367 --> 01:57:59,234
<i>I mean, somebody doesn't just randomly
prank phone call a victim's entire family</i>

1932
01:57:59,336 --> 01:58:01,361
90 minutes after they were shot.

1933
01:58:01,472 --> 01:58:03,531
<i>So, either Zodiac shoots
a random couple,</i>

1934
01:58:03,641 --> 01:58:05,131
then he recognizes Darlene...

1935
01:58:05,242 --> 01:58:07,233
Or Darlene was shot on purpose.

1936
01:58:07,344 --> 01:58:10,541
<i>Either way,
Zodiac had to have known Darlene.</i>

1937
01:58:12,449 --> 01:58:14,178
<i>That's good, Robert.</i>

1938
01:58:14,685 --> 01:58:17,882
<i>So, I can't find Mageau,
so maybe I can find Darlene's sister.</i>

1939
01:58:17,988 --> 01:58:19,888
And maybe she can tell me
who this mystery man is.

1940
01:58:19,990 --> 01:58:22,788
Try that. I've got to go. She's very cute.

1941
01:58:26,697 --> 01:58:28,221
<i>You know,</i>

1942
01:58:28,332 --> 01:58:31,665
it's interesting that you should mention
Zodiac calling people at home.

1943
01:58:31,769 --> 01:58:33,202
He did that in San Francisco once.

1944
01:58:33,304 --> 01:58:34,794
What? Who did he call?

1945
01:58:34,905 --> 01:58:37,965
I can't tell you.
That's privileged information.

1946
01:58:38,609 --> 01:58:40,770
But maybe Melvin Belli could.

1947
01:58:43,447 --> 01:58:44,971
Melvin Belli.

1948
01:58:45,916 --> 01:58:48,180
How do I get to Melvin Belli?

1949
01:58:48,285 --> 01:58:51,277
<i>- He should be along soon.
- Oh, that's all right.</i>

1950
01:58:51,388 --> 01:58:53,754
<i>I've really...
I've only been waiting two hours, so...</i>

1951
01:58:53,857 --> 01:58:55,688
He's usually not this late.

1952
01:58:55,793 --> 01:58:58,557
<i>Oh, cookies. Thank you.
These look great.</i>

1953
01:58:59,396 --> 01:59:03,298
- You are here on business?
- I'm writing a book about the Zodiac.

1954
01:59:03,400 --> 01:59:06,335
I remember that. I spoke to him.

1955
01:59:06,437 --> 01:59:11,033
<i>- You mean to Mr. Belli about the case?
- No, to the Zodiac when he called.</i>

1956
01:59:11,141 --> 01:59:14,440
He said he had to kill
because it was his birthday.

1957
01:59:14,545 --> 01:59:17,776
He said it... Wait.
He said it was his birthday?

1958
01:59:17,881 --> 01:59:20,406
Yes. You want something to drink?

1959
01:59:21,452 --> 01:59:25,445
<i>- When was this?
- Oh, so many years ago.</i>

1960
01:59:27,157 --> 01:59:29,717
Mr. Belli was away for Christmas.

1961
01:59:29,827 --> 01:59:31,055
Gone for a week.

1962
01:59:31,161 --> 01:59:33,493
<i>The Zodiac called,
wanting to talk to him.</i>

1963
01:59:33,597 --> 01:59:35,292
<i>I said, "He is not here. "</i>

1964
01:59:35,399 --> 01:59:38,300
<i>He said, "I have to kill.
Today is my birthday. "</i>

1965
01:59:38,402 --> 01:59:40,336
And then he hangs up.

1966
01:59:40,437 --> 01:59:41,927
Then the letter arrived.

1967
01:59:42,039 --> 01:59:46,066
<i>So, the call came
before the letter of December 20th.</i>

1968
01:59:46,176 --> 01:59:48,110
Mr. Belli was gone for a week?

1969
01:59:48,212 --> 01:59:51,943
He came back on Christmas.
Not a good day to work.

1970
01:59:52,049 --> 01:59:53,983
<i>So, he left on the 18th.</i>

1971
01:59:55,185 --> 01:59:56,652
Is that helpful?

1972
01:59:56,754 --> 01:59:58,187
She said it was his birthday.

1973
01:59:58,288 --> 02:00:02,088
<i>Well, you'd have to confirm that,
now wouldn't you?</i>

1974
02:00:02,192 --> 02:00:03,591
How?

1975
02:00:03,694 --> 02:00:06,788
<i>Well, I never spoke to her,
but maybe my partner did.</i>

1976
02:00:06,897 --> 02:00:09,730
<i>- How do I get a hold of him?
- You don't. Bill wanted out of this.</i>

1977
02:00:09,833 --> 02:00:12,097
<i>As far as I'm concerned,
he should stay out.</i>

1978
02:00:12,202 --> 02:00:13,464
How do I confirm it?

1979
02:00:13,570 --> 02:00:16,095
<i>Well, if my partner
did talk to someone from Justice,</i>

1980
02:00:16,206 --> 02:00:17,764
<i>then they would've had
to put that in a report.</i>

1981
02:00:17,875 --> 02:00:20,173
<i>That's standard procedure.</i>

1982
02:00:20,277 --> 02:00:22,336
<i>- Okay.
- Mel Nicolai.</i>

1983
02:00:22,446 --> 02:00:24,380
<i>- Thank you.
- Goodbye.</i>

1984
02:00:24,481 --> 02:00:26,642
I just need to confirm a date.

1985
02:00:26,750 --> 02:00:28,081
- Mr. Graysmith...
- I've narrowed it down

1986
02:00:28,185 --> 02:00:30,449
<i>between the 18th and the 20th
of December, and I just need...</i>

1987
02:00:30,554 --> 02:00:33,853
<i>Okay, I'll play.
Let's say this phone call did take place.</i>

1988
02:00:33,957 --> 02:00:35,390
Let's say it really was Zodiac.

1989
02:00:35,492 --> 02:00:38,256
Why would he volunteer
the day he was born?

1990
02:00:38,362 --> 02:00:40,489
<i>Plus, nobody died on December 18th,</i>

1991
02:00:40,597 --> 02:00:43,395
<i>just like nobody died over the weekend
when he was gonna kill a dozen people,</i>

1992
02:00:43,500 --> 02:00:45,832
or when he was gonna
shoot school kids or blow up buses.

1993
02:00:45,936 --> 02:00:47,301
<i>He's a liar, Mr. Graysmith.</i>

1994
02:00:47,404 --> 02:00:49,065
What if he made a mistake?

1995
02:00:49,173 --> 02:00:51,198
What if he wasn't lying?
What if it was him on the phone?

1996
02:00:51,308 --> 02:00:53,674
<i>He didn't expect to pick it up,
a nice person to pick up.</i>

1997
02:00:53,777 --> 02:00:55,108
What if? What if? What if?

1998
02:00:55,212 --> 02:00:58,545
<i>Look, off the record,
Bill Armstrong checked this out.</i>

1999
02:00:58,649 --> 02:01:01,243
We took this very seriously.

2000
02:01:01,351 --> 02:01:04,582
None of the suspects had the
same birthday as this phantom caller.

2001
02:01:04,688 --> 02:01:06,849
Bill Armstrong.

2002
02:01:12,429 --> 02:01:14,397
Can I give you a piece of advice?

2003
02:01:14,498 --> 02:01:16,056
You're looking in the wrong place.

2004
02:01:16,166 --> 02:01:19,192
<i>Handwriting, fingerprints,
that's what this whole thing's about.</i>

2005
02:01:19,303 --> 02:01:20,668
Stick to the evidence.

2006
02:01:21,705 --> 02:01:22,729
Hi.

2007
02:01:31,048 --> 02:01:34,176
- Hey. How was your day?
- Long.

2008
02:01:39,623 --> 02:01:41,022
Who's Sherwood Morrill?

2009
02:01:41,125 --> 02:01:43,889
He's a handwriting expert
in Sacramento.

2010
02:01:43,994 --> 02:01:45,086
He called.

2011
02:01:45,195 --> 02:01:47,288
He said he can meet you
tomorrow morning at 7:00.

2012
02:01:47,397 --> 02:01:48,659
<i>Oh, great.</i>

2013
02:01:48,766 --> 02:01:51,599
- So you're taking off work?
- Just an hour.

2014
02:01:53,403 --> 02:01:55,496
Sacramento's two hours away.

2015
02:01:56,640 --> 02:01:58,232
- Really?
- Yes.

2016
02:01:59,009 --> 02:02:00,533
What's this?

2017
02:02:00,644 --> 02:02:03,272
<i>Oh, that's that article.</i>

2018
02:02:03,380 --> 02:02:06,941
"Robert Graysmith has quietly been
shopping his book about the Zodiac. "

2019
02:02:07,050 --> 02:02:08,142
Yeah.

2020
02:02:08,252 --> 02:02:10,880
It talks all about you
researching Zodiac.

2021
02:02:10,988 --> 02:02:12,387
<i>Well, that's what the article's about.</i>

2022
02:02:12,489 --> 02:02:14,923
I'm not so sure that's something
we want people to know about.

2023
02:02:15,025 --> 02:02:16,083
Why? Are you embarrassed?

2024
02:02:16,193 --> 02:02:19,356
<i>Robert, what's the one thing
we know about Zodiac?</i>

2025
02:02:20,030 --> 02:02:21,224
<i>He reads the Chronicle.</i>

2026
02:02:21,331 --> 02:02:23,822
<i>Yeah, but he's never
gonna read Herb Caen.</i>

2027
02:02:28,505 --> 02:02:30,803
<i>- Hello.
- Mr. Graysmith?</i>

2028
02:02:30,908 --> 02:02:33,468
<i>The Robert Graysmith
mentioned in the paper today?</i>

2029
02:02:33,577 --> 02:02:36,671
<i>- Yeah?
- I can tell you who the Zodiac is.</i>

2030
02:02:40,484 --> 02:02:41,508
Who is this?

2031
02:02:41,618 --> 02:02:43,745
<i>The Zodiac Killer
is obsessed with movies.</i>

2032
02:02:43,854 --> 02:02:46,550
<i>He recorded his murders on film.</i>

2033
02:02:46,657 --> 02:02:50,024
<i>I tried to tell the police,
but they wouldn't follow through on it.</i>

2034
02:02:50,127 --> 02:02:53,062
<i>There's a man you need to find.
His name is Bob Vaughn.</i>

2035
02:02:53,163 --> 02:02:55,688
<i>- Pen, pen.
- V- A-U-G-H-N.</i>

2036
02:02:55,799 --> 02:02:57,926
<i>He's a friend of the Zodiac's.</i>

2037
02:02:58,035 --> 02:03:00,162
<i>Mr. Vaughn does not know
his friend is a killer,</i>

2038
02:03:00,270 --> 02:03:02,864
<i>and he is storing
some film canisters for him.</i>

2039
02:03:02,973 --> 02:03:04,668
<i>In these canisters is the evidence.</i>

2040
02:03:04,775 --> 02:03:08,142
<i>Okay, yeah, friend? Who is this friend?</i>

2041
02:03:08,245 --> 02:03:09,872
<i>You have quite enough to get started.</i>

2042
02:03:09,980 --> 02:03:11,709
<i>Oh, please.</i>

2043
02:03:11,815 --> 02:03:15,114
<i>The Zodiac's name is Rick Marshall.</i>

2044
02:03:18,989 --> 02:03:20,820
Your toast is burning.

2045
02:03:21,859 --> 02:03:24,355
We choose at some point in our lives
how to physically construct each letter.

2046
02:03:24,390 --> 02:03:26,851
We choose at some point in our lives
how to physically construct each letter.

2047
02:03:27,664 --> 02:03:29,859
<i>Once we lock that into our brains,</i>

2048
02:03:29,967 --> 02:03:32,265
<i>our handwriting may change
over the years,</i>

2049
02:03:32,369 --> 02:03:35,031
but the moves themselves
remain unaltered.

2050
02:03:35,138 --> 02:03:36,628
- Understand?
- Yes.

2051
02:03:38,242 --> 02:03:40,176
Except Zodiac's doesn't.

2052
02:03:41,778 --> 02:03:43,712
Specifically with his "K."

2053
02:03:44,948 --> 02:03:47,849
<i>In his first letters,
he executed the "K" with two strokes.</i>

2054
02:03:47,951 --> 02:03:49,418
<i>Later letters, he did them with three.</i>

2055
02:03:49,519 --> 02:03:51,783
- Why?
- We don't know.

2056
02:03:51,889 --> 02:03:53,823
<i>Excuse me, I've got to spray this.</i>

2057
02:03:53,924 --> 02:03:57,052
How many suspects
were cleared through handwriting?

2058
02:03:57,160 --> 02:03:58,593
All of them.

2059
02:03:58,695 --> 02:04:02,153
Also the print in the cab.
No match was ever found.

2060
02:04:02,266 --> 02:04:06,293
Is there any way that someone
could beat a handwriting test?

2061
02:04:06,403 --> 02:04:07,392
No.

2062
02:04:07,504 --> 02:04:10,667
<i>Whoever the Zodiac is,
he's not someone I cleared.</i>

2063
02:04:11,608 --> 02:04:15,066
<i>About a month ago, a man showed up
on my doorstep very distraught.</i>

2064
02:04:15,178 --> 02:04:17,237
His name was Wallace Penny.

2065
02:04:18,181 --> 02:04:20,445
He said he knew who the Zodiac was.

2066
02:04:20,550 --> 02:04:22,575
Gave me a name.

2067
02:04:22,686 --> 02:04:24,881
Rick. Rick somebody.

2068
02:04:24,988 --> 02:04:27,388
- Rick Marshall?
- Yeah.

2069
02:04:27,491 --> 02:04:30,016
<i>I think that the man
who you talked to called me, too.</i>

2070
02:04:30,127 --> 02:04:32,721
<i>After he left, then I checked my files.</i>

2071
02:04:32,829 --> 02:04:34,524
I never cleared a Rick Marshall.

2072
02:04:41,805 --> 02:04:42,931
Hello?

2073
02:04:48,111 --> 02:04:49,806
Hello? Who is this?

2074
02:04:59,990 --> 02:05:01,890
It's a wrong number.

2075
02:05:07,864 --> 02:05:10,992
Does the name Rick Marshall
mean anything to you?

2076
02:05:12,035 --> 02:05:14,060
What are you after?

2077
02:05:14,171 --> 02:05:15,229
What do you got?

2078
02:05:15,339 --> 02:05:19,571
<i>Hypothetically, you just named
my favorite suspect in the whole case.</i>

2079
02:05:20,744 --> 02:05:22,211
This is off the record.

2080
02:05:22,312 --> 02:05:24,644
<i>Couple years back,
I was trying to get Marshall's prints.</i>

2081
02:05:24,748 --> 02:05:26,477
I handed him a photo.

2082
02:05:26,583 --> 02:05:28,949
<i>He looks at it. He's about to give it back
and he stops and he says,</i>

2083
02:05:29,052 --> 02:05:31,486
<i>"My goodness,
I got fingerprints all over this. "</i>

2084
02:05:31,588 --> 02:05:33,419
And he wipes them off.

2085
02:05:34,157 --> 02:05:35,852
Why didn't you test him for handwriting?

2086
02:05:35,959 --> 02:05:38,587
<i>Because when they finally
did run his prints,</i>

2087
02:05:38,695 --> 02:05:40,959
they cleared him
against the one in Stine's cab.

2088
02:05:41,064 --> 02:05:43,157
<i>- So, then, it's not him.
- Maybe yes, maybe no.</i>

2089
02:05:43,266 --> 02:05:45,291
No. What do you mean?

2090
02:05:45,402 --> 02:05:47,768
Zodiac left gloves behind at the scene.

2091
02:05:47,871 --> 02:05:49,896
<i>If he had the foresight
to bring gloves with him,</i>

2092
02:05:50,007 --> 02:05:51,998
how the hell's he gonna
accidentally leave a print behind?

2093
02:05:52,109 --> 02:05:54,100
But it was in the victim's blood.

2094
02:05:54,211 --> 02:05:55,542
<i>Could have been one of the bystanders,</i>

2095
02:05:55,645 --> 02:05:58,011
<i>or a cop just reaches out,
boom, false print.</i>

2096
02:05:58,115 --> 02:06:00,481
<i>Yeah, but that print
disqualified 2,500 suspects.</i>

2097
02:06:00,584 --> 02:06:01,881
Which is why we also used handwriting.

2098
02:06:01,985 --> 02:06:03,282
But not for Rick Marshall.

2099
02:06:03,387 --> 02:06:06,447
SFPD saw a handwritten sign
in the window of his house.

2100
02:06:06,556 --> 02:06:10,390
<i>Decided it looked nothing
like the Z letters, so they just moved on.</i>

2101
02:06:10,494 --> 02:06:12,724
How do they know
that Rick Marshall wrote the sign?

2102
02:06:12,829 --> 02:06:14,091
My thoughts exactly.

2103
02:06:15,098 --> 02:06:18,761
Rick Marshall was a Navy man.
He received code training.

2104
02:06:18,869 --> 02:06:21,303
He was also a projectionist
at a silent film theater.

2105
02:06:21,405 --> 02:06:23,498
<i>Well, then, how do I get copies
of Rick Marshall's handwriting?</i>

2106
02:06:23,607 --> 02:06:27,475
<i>Three ways.
One, get a warrant, which you can't.</i>

2107
02:06:27,577 --> 02:06:29,704
<i>Two, get him to volunteer,
which he won't.</i>

2108
02:06:29,813 --> 02:06:31,713
<i>Yeah, and three?</i>

2109
02:06:31,815 --> 02:06:33,442
Get creative.

2110
02:06:33,550 --> 02:06:36,280
<i>I don't know what to tell you.
You get it, I'll analyze it.</i>

2111
02:06:36,386 --> 02:06:37,751
<i>Beyond that, you're on your own.</i>

2112
02:06:37,854 --> 02:06:40,288
<i>Okay, what about
the guy who came to see you,</i>

2113
02:06:40,390 --> 02:06:41,789
the one who called me?

2114
02:06:41,892 --> 02:06:44,360
<i>You mean Wallace Penny?</i>

2115
02:06:44,461 --> 02:06:46,554
Yeah. Did he leave a number?

2116
02:06:55,906 --> 02:06:59,171
<i>- Hello?
- Hi, this is Robert Graysmith.</i>

2117
02:06:59,276 --> 02:07:00,265
<i>How did you find me?</i>

2118
02:07:00,377 --> 02:07:02,402
I need a sample
of Rick Marshall's handwriting.

2119
02:07:02,512 --> 02:07:03,809
<i>I told you. Vaughn is who...</i>

2120
02:07:03,914 --> 02:07:06,883
<i>Mr. Penny,
if Rick Marshall is the Zodiac,</i>

2121
02:07:06,983 --> 02:07:09,451
I need a sample of his handwriting
to confirm it.

2122
02:07:09,553 --> 02:07:11,145
Can you help me or not?

2123
02:07:12,856 --> 02:07:17,520
<i>Rick used to draw movie posters
for the theater Vaughn worked at.</i>

2124
02:07:17,627 --> 02:07:19,527
<i>- I'll send one down.
- Thank you.</i>

2125
02:07:29,539 --> 02:07:31,939
<i>- I'll need to see more samples.
- Yeah, but is it...</i>

2126
02:07:32,042 --> 02:07:34,533
It's as close as I've ever seen.
We have to tread lightly here.

2127
02:07:34,644 --> 02:07:37,078
We're talking about
implicating this man as the Zodiac.

2128
02:07:37,180 --> 02:07:40,172
I can get more. I'll just find Vaughn
and I'll track down Linda.

2129
02:07:40,283 --> 02:07:42,251
<i>I mean, Linda is Darlene's sister.</i>

2130
02:07:42,352 --> 02:07:45,048
<i>I've been to the DMV,
and I talked to her parents,</i>

2131
02:07:45,155 --> 02:07:48,249
<i>but still, nobody knows
where to find her.</i>

2132
02:07:48,358 --> 02:07:52,818
<i>Mr. Graysmith, most of the writing
matches the exemplar.</i>

2133
02:07:52,929 --> 02:07:55,955
<i>In a way, though, it's the part that
doesn't match that scares me the most.</i>

2134
02:07:56,066 --> 02:07:58,466
<i>- What do you mean?
- Well, on the poster,</i>

2135
02:07:58,568 --> 02:08:01,662
<i>the one letter that absolutely,
positively does not match</i>

2136
02:08:01,771 --> 02:08:03,329
is the letter "K."

2137
02:08:05,342 --> 02:08:09,210
<i>You wouldn't happen to have any
animal crackers in there, would you?</i>

2138
02:08:09,312 --> 02:08:12,873
<i>Unit Five.
Toschi needs to call in on a landline.</i>

2139
02:08:24,895 --> 02:08:27,261
<i>- Dispatch.

2140

<i>I'll connect you.</i>

2141

<i>- Dave?
- Yeah. What's up?</i>

2142
02:08:31,401 --> 02:08:33,835
<i>Jennings here from the Chronicle.</i>

2143
02:08:33,937 --> 02:08:35,734
It came in this morning
and you need to see it right now.

2144
02:08:35,839 --> 02:08:36,897
See what?

2145
02:08:37,007 --> 02:08:39,737
<i>The new Zodiac letter.
And it mentions you.</i>

2146
02:08:39,843 --> 02:08:40,901
<i>Okay, okay.</i>

2147
02:08:43,213 --> 02:08:45,477
<i>Shit. All right, come on.</i>

2148
02:08:45,582 --> 02:08:47,516
Hall of Justice!

2149
02:08:47,617 --> 02:08:50,677
<i>Now! Come on, come on,
come on, come on, come on!</i>

02:08:57,027 --> 02:08:58,085
Dave!

2151
02:08:59,229 --> 02:09:01,163
Do you have it with you?

2152
02:09:04,434 --> 02:09:06,629
"This is the Zodiac speaking.
I'm back with you.

"I'm now in control of all things. "

2158

These guys are from Internal Affairs.

2159
02:09:26,122 --> 02:09:27,714

<i>Good evening. Our top story tonight,</i>

2161

<i>Good evening. Our top story tonight,</i>

2162
02:09:29,693 --> 02:09:32,184
<i>the San Francisco Police Department
has confirmed</i>

2163
02:09:32,295 --> 02:09:34,786
<i>that the man
who calls himself the Zodiac</i>

2164

<i>and terrorized the Bay Area
has broken his silence of 51 months.</i>

<i>In a letter claiming,
"I am back with you,"</i>

2166

<i>the Zodiac makes no overt threats
against the citizenry,</i>

2167

<i>and muses that his life and times
would make the best movie script yet.</i>

2168
02:09:48,778 --> 02:09:50,268
These carrots are perfect.

2169

<i>The terse 66 word message

<i>...to mention San Francisco Chronicle

<i>Thank you, Eric.</i>

2180
02:10:09,733 --> 02:10:12,201
<i>San Francisco Chronicle columnist
Armistead Maupin says</i>

2181
02:10:12,302 --> 02:10:14,896
<i>that he thinks not only
is this new letter a forgery,</i>

2182
02:10:15,005 --> 02:10:16,939
<i>but it was written by the very man</i>

2183
02:10:17,040 --> 02:10:20,771
<i>trusted to hunt down this killer,
David Toschi.</i>

2184
02:10:20,877 --> 02:10:24,540
<i>Maupin, a very well-respected author,
has gone on record saying</i>

2185
02:10:24,648 --> 02:10:29,244
<i>that he believes Toschi wrote the letter
to drum up publicity for himself.</i>

2186
02:10:29,352 --> 02:10:32,412
Maupin used David
as a character in his column.

2187
02:10:32,522 --> 02:10:34,422
David got a kick out of it

2188
02:10:34,524 --> 02:10:36,515
and so he wrote
a couple of anonymous letters

2189
02:10:36,626 --> 02:10:38,526
asking for the character
to be brought back.

2190

<i>It was like
writing fan mail to himself. That's all.</i>

2191
02:10:41,731 --> 02:10:43,926
<i>But David did not write that letter.</i>

2192
02:10:44,034 --> 02:10:47,162
<i>No, I'm sure that he didn't.
And I'm sure that this will all blow over.</i>

2193
02:10:47,270 --> 02:10:48,601
<i>Blow over?</i>

2194
02:10:48,705 --> 02:10:50,900
They kicked him out of Homicide.

2195
02:10:51,007 --> 02:10:54,272
They made him give his handwriting
like some common criminal.

<i>- May I talk to him?

02:10:59,049 --> 02:11:01,415
if he ever investigated
a man named Rick Marshall?

2199
02:11:01,518 --> 02:11:03,281

Sherwood?

2210
02:11:34,517 --> 02:11:36,610
Sherwood who was fired
from Questioned Documents?

2211
02:11:36,720 --> 02:11:38,278
Sherwood who drinks
like Paul Avery now?

2212
02:11:38,388 --> 02:11:40,879
- He retired.
- Is that what he told you?

2213
02:11:40,990 --> 02:11:45,154
<i>- What, are you saying he's wrong?

<i>Okay, the Rick Marshalls

2221
02:11:58,041 --> 02:11:59,008

<i>But he said he wasn't gonna announce

- So what are you saying?

2230
02:12:22,332 --> 02:12:25,460
I am saying Zodiac was my job.

<i>Yeah. How can I help?</i>

2246
02:13:22,525 --> 02:13:25,187
I called you because we've been

02:13:27,063 --> 02:13:31,295
<i>More often than not, each cycle
since '69 corresponds with an attack</i>

2249
02:13:31,401 --> 02:13:34,268
<i>or with one of the letters,
or an unsolved homicide.</i>

2250
02:13:34,370 --> 02:13:37,203
<i>- Who's working with you on this?
- Some colleagues.</i>

2251
02:13:37,307 --> 02:13:38,331
Dad?

2252
02:13:39,676 --> 02:13:42,110
<i>- Ken, can you hold on one second?
- Dad?</i>

2253
02:13:42,212 --> 02:13:44,203
- What is it?
- What's this?

2254
02:13:48,084 --> 02:13:51,144
<i>In the decade since the Zodiac's
last cipher was received,</i>

2255
02:13:51,254 --> 02:13:54,712
<i>every federal agency
has taken a crack at decoding it.</i>

2256
02:13:54,824 --> 02:13:57,588
<i>But today,
where those agencies had failed,</i>

2257
02:13:57,694 --> 02:14:00,322
<i>a cartoonist has succeeded.</i>

2258
02:14:00,430 --> 02:14:01,954
<i>How did you do it?</i>

2259
02:14:02,065 --> 02:14:07,469
<i>Oh, just a lot of books from the library,
and I love puzzles, so I just...</i>

2260
02:14:09,572 --> 02:14:11,767
Yeah. The fucking library.

2261
02:14:11,875 --> 02:14:15,003
<i>I believe that you can accomplish
anything that you put your mind...</i>

2262
02:14:17,914 --> 02:14:20,678
That's a "J"? Okay. Honor Camp?

2263
02:14:22,318 --> 02:14:23,945
Thank you so much.

2264
02:14:25,955 --> 02:14:28,185
<i>Hey, we found Linda.
She's in jail. Isn't that great?</i>

2265
02:14:28,291 --> 02:14:29,417
Why'd you do it?

2266
02:14:29,526 --> 02:14:30,959
Because she'll be able to identify Rick...

2267
02:14:31,060 --> 02:14:33,756
- What are you talking about?
- You went on TV.

2268
02:14:34,364 --> 02:14:36,025
You put yourself out there
for him to see.

2269
02:14:36,132 --> 02:14:37,622
<i>Oh, hon, you're being paranoid.</i>

2270
02:14:37,734 --> 02:14:39,725
Then who's been calling our house
in the middle of the night

2271
02:14:39,836 --> 02:14:40,825
at least once a week?

2272
02:14:40,937 --> 02:14:42,097
Nobody.

2273
02:14:44,107 --> 02:14:45,768
What's it gonna take
for you to be done with this?

2274
02:14:45,875 --> 02:14:48,776
I can't talk about this now.
I have to go see Bob Vaughn.

2275
02:14:48,878 --> 02:14:52,211
<i>Well, that's too bad,
because we're gonna talk about this.</i>

2276
02:14:52,315 --> 02:14:54,647
And when is it gonna be finished?

2277
02:14:54,751 --> 02:14:56,582
When you catch him?
When you arrest him?

2278
02:14:56,686 --> 02:14:58,881
- Be serious.
- I am serious.

2279
02:15:00,723 --> 02:15:04,215
I need to know who he is.

2280
02:15:04,327 --> 02:15:07,455
<i>I need to stand there,</i>

2281
02:15:07,564 --> 02:15:11,466
I need to look him in the eye
and I need to know that it's him.

2282
02:15:13,369 --> 02:15:15,633
Is that more important
than your family's safety?

2283
02:15:15,738 --> 02:15:17,205
Of course not.

2284
02:15:19,208 --> 02:15:21,574
Why? Why do you need to do this?

2285
02:15:23,479 --> 02:15:24,537
Why?

2286
02:15:26,549 --> 02:15:28,517
Because nobody else will.

2287
02:15:28,618 --> 02:15:30,552
That's not good enough.

2288
02:15:30,653 --> 02:15:32,518
Are you done? Can I go?

2289
02:15:47,837 --> 02:15:49,862
- Mr. Vaughn?
- Mr. Graysmith?

2290
02:15:49,973 --> 02:15:50,997
- Yes.
- Hi.

2291
02:15:51,107 --> 02:15:52,438
You needed to speak to me?

2292
02:15:52,542 --> 02:15:54,942
Yes. There's a coffee shop
right on the corner.

2293
02:15:55,044 --> 02:15:58,104
<i>- Why don't we just go to my home?
- Oh, I don't wanna put you out.</i>

2294
02:15:58,214 --> 02:16:00,114
It's no trouble at all.

2295
02:16:00,216 --> 02:16:02,684
- Where are you parked?
- Just right there.

2296
02:16:02,785 --> 02:16:06,118
- You can follow me.
- Oh. Okay.

2297
02:16:24,841 --> 02:16:26,399
Watch your step.

2298
02:16:27,910 --> 02:16:29,571
Come in.

2299
02:16:31,014 --> 02:16:34,142
<i>- Very nice house.
- Oh, thank you.</i>

2300
02:16:34,250 --> 02:16:36,081
It's very rustic.

2301
02:16:36,185 --> 02:16:39,348
<i>- Can I take your jacket?
- No, thank you, I'm fine.</i>

2302
02:16:39,455 --> 02:16:41,423
<i>Okay. This way, please.</i>

2303
02:16:44,227 --> 02:16:45,956
- Have a seat.
- Thank you.

2304
02:16:46,062 --> 02:16:48,587
<i>- How about some tea?
- Oh, no, I'm all right.</i>

2305
02:16:48,698 --> 02:16:50,131
- You sure?
- Yes.

2306
02:16:51,034 --> 02:16:54,765
I wanted to ask you about a film
that the Avenue may have played

2307
02:16:54,871 --> 02:16:56,771
while you were the organist there.

2308
02:16:56,873 --> 02:16:59,137
<i>The Most Dangerous Game?</i>

2309
02:16:59,242 --> 02:17:02,575
<i>Oh, it's a classic. RKO. 1932.</i>

2310
02:17:02,679 --> 02:17:07,378
<i>Fay Wray, Joel McCrea, Leslie Banks.
We've run that picture many times.</i>

2311
02:17:07,483 --> 02:17:08,973
<i>In '68, '69?</i>

2312
02:17:10,620 --> 02:17:12,815
I'd have to check my records. Why?

2313
02:17:12,922 --> 02:17:14,981
Do you remember the Zodiac?

2314
02:17:17,226 --> 02:17:19,490
<i>This is about Rick Marshall, isn't it?</i>

2315
02:17:19,595 --> 02:17:22,996
<i>- He was a projectionist there, right?
- For a time, yes.</i>

2316
02:17:23,099 --> 02:17:27,126
But I have no occasion
to correspond with him these days.

2317
02:17:27,236 --> 02:17:29,704
<i>Okay. Well, there is a connection</i>

2318
02:17:29,806 --> 02:17:32,570
between one of the Zodiac attacks
and that film.

2319
02:17:32,675 --> 02:17:34,404
You mean the symbol?

2320
02:17:35,678 --> 02:17:36,872
Hold on.

2321
02:17:37,447 --> 02:17:41,543
The Zodiac symbol on film.
It's on the countdown.

2322
02:17:45,455 --> 02:17:48,049
<i>It's trimmed off each reel
before it's shown,</i>

2323
02:17:48,157 --> 02:17:50,682
but it always arrives with it.

2324
02:17:50,793 --> 02:17:52,158
Right there.

2325
02:17:52,795 --> 02:17:56,458
<i>The first time I saw it in the papers,
I thought about that.</i>

2326
02:17:57,333 --> 02:17:58,857
We got a tip

2327
02:17:58,968 --> 02:18:02,927
that Rick left a film canister here
that he told you never to open.

2328
02:18:03,039 --> 02:18:06,167
A tip about a mysterious film canister?

2329
02:18:07,043 --> 02:18:08,374
Is it true?

2330
02:18:10,313 --> 02:18:11,473
Yes.

2331
02:18:12,181 --> 02:18:14,479
- Did you open it?
- No.

2332
02:18:14,584 --> 02:18:18,850
- May I see it?
- Rick took it back in 1972.

2333
02:18:20,590 --> 02:18:25,357
This tip is how you got it in your head
that Rick is the Zodiac?

2334
02:18:25,461 --> 02:18:27,122
That and the poster.

2335
02:18:27,230 --> 02:18:28,561
The poster?

2336
02:18:30,533 --> 02:18:32,296
The poster that Rick drew.

2337
02:18:32,401 --> 02:18:35,598
The handwriting is the closest
that we have ever come to a match.

2338
02:18:35,705 --> 02:18:38,970
<i>- Rick didn't draw any posters.
- No, he drew this one.</i>

2339
02:18:39,075 --> 02:18:42,511
<i>Mr. Graysmith, I do the posters myself.</i>

2340
02:18:43,913 --> 02:18:45,744
That's my handwriting.

2341
02:18:54,023 --> 02:18:56,890
I won't take any more of your time.

2342
02:18:56,993 --> 02:19:02,363
Why don't I just go and find out
when we played that film?

2343
02:19:02,465 --> 02:19:03,932
<i>Oh, that's all right.</i>

2344
02:19:04,033 --> 02:19:07,434
It's not a problem.
They're just down in the basement.

2345
02:19:09,272 --> 02:19:12,173
Not many people
have basements in California.

2346
02:19:14,877 --> 02:19:15,935
I do.

2347
02:19:18,147 --> 02:19:20,115
<i>You coming, Mr. Graysmith?</i>

2348
02:19:31,427 --> 02:19:35,090
<i>The original studio one-sheets,
I always kept for myself.</i>

2349
02:19:36,999 --> 02:19:39,524
The cheapo knock-offs
like you brought today

2350
02:19:39,635 --> 02:19:42,763
I end up tossing into the back alley.

2351
02:19:57,286 --> 02:19:58,776
'69.

2352
02:20:04,493 --> 02:20:05,721
You live alone?

2353
02:20:05,828 --> 02:20:11,596
<i>Most Dangerous Game ran in May '69.</i>

2354
02:20:11,701 --> 02:20:14,135
<i>So, that would be about</i>

2355
02:20:15,071 --> 02:20:18,336
<i>nine weeks before
the first Zodiac letter, correct?</i>

2356
02:20:21,277 --> 02:20:22,335
Yeah.

2357
02:20:26,849 --> 02:20:31,115
Do you think he saw the film
in our theater and was inspired?

2358
02:20:37,226 --> 02:20:40,093
Are you sure
there's nobody else in the house?

2359
02:20:41,731 --> 02:20:44,393
Would you like
to go upstairs and check?

2360
02:20:45,134 --> 02:20:46,123
No.

2361
02:20:49,272 --> 02:20:51,797
Thank you. Thanks for everything.

2362
02:20:52,675 --> 02:20:54,142
You're welcome.

2363
02:21:15,464 --> 02:21:16,829
It's locked.

2364
02:21:27,710 --> 02:21:29,007
Thank you.

2365
02:21:32,148 --> 02:21:34,139
<i>Good night, Mr. Graysmith!</i>

2366
02:21:54,103 --> 02:21:57,766
Two killers. Got to be two killers.
One has the...

2367
02:22:05,648 --> 02:22:06,808
Guys?

2368
02:22:40,383 --> 02:22:42,317
You've got five minutes.

2369
02:22:50,493 --> 02:22:51,619
Linda?

2370
02:22:52,795 --> 02:22:54,262
<i>Hi, I'm Robert.</i>

2371
02:22:58,234 --> 02:22:59,963
Did you get my note?

2372
02:23:00,936 --> 02:23:02,904
- What's this about?
- Zodiac.

2373
02:23:04,473 --> 02:23:05,667
Figures.

2374
02:23:07,043 --> 02:23:09,773
- You got the look.
- What look?

2375
02:23:09,879 --> 02:23:11,870
I didn't mean anything.

2376
02:23:13,115 --> 02:23:15,481
Tell me about this painting party.

2377
02:23:16,685 --> 02:23:19,279
I told the cops about that so long ago.

2378
02:23:22,758 --> 02:23:24,521
<i>Darlene always had
a lot of boys around,</i>

2379
02:23:24,627 --> 02:23:26,561
even though she was married.

2380
02:23:26,662 --> 02:23:28,653
<i>And this one guy was weird, though.</i>

2381
02:23:28,764 --> 02:23:32,097
He used to bring her presents
from Tijuana and...

2382
02:23:33,335 --> 02:23:35,929
I don't know why
she was friends with him.

2383
02:23:36,038 --> 02:23:38,506
She once told me he'd killed somebody.

2384
02:23:38,607 --> 02:23:40,165
Really?

2385
02:23:40,276 --> 02:23:42,471
<i>Yeah, I think maybe
when he was in the service.</i>

2386
02:23:42,578 --> 02:23:44,546
- Navy?
- I think so.

2387
02:23:44,647 --> 02:23:46,808
Was he into movies?
Was he a movie buff?

2388
02:23:46,916 --> 02:23:49,817
I can tell you that
he was not into people.

2389
02:23:49,919 --> 02:23:51,250
<i>The party Darlene threw,</i>

2390
02:23:51,353 --> 02:23:54,254
<i>people were supposed to
just show up and drink beer, help paint.</i>

2391
02:23:54,356 --> 02:23:56,586
<i>But this guy showed up in a suit,</i>

2392
02:23:56,692 --> 02:23:59,627
and just sat in a chair
all by himself all night long.

2393
02:23:59,728 --> 02:24:01,161
Didn't talk to anyone.

2394
02:24:01,263 --> 02:24:03,094
And Darlene told me
to stay away from him.

2395
02:24:03,199 --> 02:24:05,030
She was scared of him.

2396
02:24:07,303 --> 02:24:09,771
<i>And a couple of weeks later,
she was dead.</i>

2397
02:24:09,872 --> 02:24:12,340
I'm sorry. Do you remember his name?

2398
02:24:13,342 --> 02:24:17,210
<i>I mean, it was short,
like a nickname, like Stan.</i>

2399
02:24:17,313 --> 02:24:19,611
<i>- Rick?
- No, I don't think so.</i>

2400
02:24:20,516 --> 02:24:22,711
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

2401
02:24:22,818 --> 02:24:25,343
How can you be sure?
It was a long time ago. Think hard.

2402
02:24:25,454 --> 02:24:27,479
I am thinking hard.

2403
02:24:27,590 --> 02:24:28,955
It was Rick.

2404
02:24:29,992 --> 02:24:31,084
<i>No, it wasn't.</i>

2405
02:24:31,193 --> 02:24:33,559
- It was Rick. It was Rick Marshall.
- No.

2406
02:24:33,662 --> 02:24:35,357
Just say it!

2407
02:24:35,464 --> 02:24:37,295
It wasn't Rick.

2408
02:24:50,079 --> 02:24:51,410
It was Leigh.

2409
02:24:54,583 --> 02:24:55,847
<i>- Leigh?
- Yeah, Leigh.</i>

2410
02:24:55,882 --> 02:24:57,111
<i>- Leigh?
- Yeah, Leigh.</i>

2411
02:24:58,454 --> 02:24:59,751
Sounds right.

2412
02:25:04,593 --> 02:25:07,426
Officer! I need you to let me in.

2413
02:25:07,530 --> 02:25:09,657
<i>- Is this an emergency?
- No, I just need to see one file.</i>

2414
02:25:09,765 --> 02:25:11,392
<i>No, you need to come back
tomorrow morning.</i>

2415
02:25:11,500 --> 02:25:13,695
<i>- One file, just for one second.
- 8:00 a. M., when we're open.</i>

2416
02:25:13,802 --> 02:25:15,429
Sergeant! Sergeant Mulanax!

2417
02:25:15,538 --> 02:25:17,972
<i>Sergeant, I just need to see one file!</i>

2418
02:25:18,073 --> 02:25:21,474
Just give me five minutes.
I know exactly where it is.

2419
02:25:22,478 --> 02:25:23,638
Please!

2420
02:25:37,026 --> 02:25:38,687
I shouldn't be talking to you.

2421
02:25:38,794 --> 02:25:40,785
- You got five minutes.
- Okay.

2422
02:25:43,065 --> 02:25:44,293
Here. Here.

2423
02:25:44,400 --> 02:25:48,166
<i>Linda states that some of
Darlene's closest friends are Leigh,</i>

2424
02:25:48,270 --> 02:25:51,239
who used to bring Darlene
presents from Tijuana.

2425
02:25:51,340 --> 02:25:53,240
- So what?
- He knew her.

2426
02:25:53,342 --> 02:25:55,037
Linda said Leigh. This is Leigh.

2427
02:25:55,144 --> 02:25:57,578
No. That's just one name in a file
that contains hundreds.

2428
02:25:57,680 --> 02:25:59,113
It's nothing.

2429
02:25:59,882 --> 02:26:02,043
- Dave Toschi...
- Agrees with me.

2430
02:26:02,585 --> 02:26:05,452
Our investigation
into this subject is over.

2431
02:26:08,457 --> 02:26:09,719
I'm sorry.

2432
02:26:18,901 --> 02:26:20,027
Hello.

2433
02:26:35,217 --> 02:26:36,616
Who's there?

2434
02:26:40,089 --> 02:26:43,581
<i>- You didn't return my calls.
- Oh, I've been kind of busy.</i>

2435
02:26:43,692 --> 02:26:45,523
Yeah. I can see that.

2436
02:26:47,763 --> 02:26:49,594
How's the book coming?

2437
02:26:52,668 --> 02:26:54,659
I tried to send you these.

2438
02:26:55,771 --> 02:26:57,534
<i>I called the Chron.</i>

2439
02:26:57,640 --> 02:27:00,404
<i>Well, I'm not a cartoonist anymore, so...</i>

2440
02:27:01,977 --> 02:27:03,171
I heard.

2441
02:27:08,350 --> 02:27:10,944
When's the last time
you ate something?

2442
02:27:13,489 --> 02:27:15,582
Nothing makes sense anymore.

2443
02:27:18,294 --> 02:27:20,558
<i>- Did it ever?
- Yeah, it did.</i>

2444
02:27:22,064 --> 02:27:24,965
<i>Robert, it was just the date
that didn't end.</i>

2445
02:27:25,467 --> 02:27:27,230
You don't mean that.

2446
02:27:28,671 --> 02:27:29,865
A little.

2447
02:27:32,741 --> 02:27:34,538
The kids miss you.

2448
02:27:34,643 --> 02:27:37,737
- I can't have them see me like this.
- Neither can I.

2449
02:27:38,514 --> 02:27:40,607
<i>So, do whatever you have to,</i>

2450
02:27:41,583 --> 02:27:43,107
but finish this.

2451
02:28:10,679 --> 02:28:11,737
Dave!

2452
02:28:12,614 --> 02:28:14,241
Dave! It's Robert!

2453
02:28:16,418 --> 02:28:18,045
- Dave!
- Is he actually here?

2454
02:28:18,153 --> 02:28:19,848
I'm gonna kill him.

2455
02:28:20,222 --> 02:28:22,816
I'm calling SFPD. Where's my gun?

2456
02:28:25,394 --> 02:28:26,520
Dave!

2457
02:28:26,628 --> 02:28:28,357
Robert! Go away!

2458
02:28:28,464 --> 02:28:30,432
Dave! He made a mistake!

2459
02:28:30,532 --> 02:28:32,500
- Get away from the window.
- I'll meet you around front.

2460
02:28:32,601 --> 02:28:34,068
<i>No, you won't.</i>

2461
02:28:35,237 --> 02:28:37,432
<i>- You have to hear this!
- No, I don't, Robert!</i>

2462
02:28:37,539 --> 02:28:40,007
The birthday was the one time
that he was weak!

2463
02:28:40,109 --> 02:28:41,906
The one time
that he gave something away!

2464
02:28:42,010 --> 02:28:45,309
<i>- Robert, I am calling the police.
- It's Arthur Leigh Allen!</i>

2465
02:28:50,352 --> 02:28:52,616
Where did you get that name?

2466
02:28:52,721 --> 02:28:54,245
He called the Bellis' house.

2467
02:28:54,356 --> 02:28:56,586
December '69.
"I need to kill. Today's my birthday. "

2468
02:28:56,692 --> 02:28:58,660
It was his birthday.

2469
02:28:58,761 --> 02:29:01,662
Arthur Leigh Allen
was born on December 18th.

2470
02:29:04,733 --> 02:29:06,098
Get in here.

2471
02:29:08,237 --> 02:29:10,398
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

2472
02:29:13,375 --> 02:29:15,206
<i>He wrote me, you know?</i>

2473
02:29:15,911 --> 02:29:17,037
<i>2,500 suspects,</i>

2474
02:29:17,146 --> 02:29:20,707
the only one who ever wrote me
a letter was Leigh Allen.

2475
02:29:21,650 --> 02:29:23,345
<i>They like to help, you know, sometimes.</i>

2476
02:29:23,452 --> 02:29:25,215
<i>Yes, Robert, I know.</i>

2477
02:29:26,355 --> 02:29:29,051
He was arrested January 1975
for molestation.

2478
02:29:29,158 --> 02:29:31,058
He sent me that when he got out.

2479
02:29:31,160 --> 02:29:33,890
<i>"Dear Dave, if I can ever be
of any help to you, just let me know.</i>

2480
02:29:33,996 --> 02:29:35,827
"I'm sorry I wasn't your man. "

2481
02:29:35,931 --> 02:29:37,489
And it's typewritten.

2482
02:29:37,599 --> 02:29:39,965
Using a typewriter is not a crime.

2483
02:29:41,437 --> 02:29:43,200
And he knew Darlene.

2484
02:29:44,606 --> 02:29:46,597
It's in the Vallejo files.

2485
02:29:51,814 --> 02:29:55,147
Mulanax said that
he was your favorite suspect.

2486
02:29:55,250 --> 02:29:59,209
<i>That you spent two years on him,
and that nobody ever came close.</i>

2487
02:30:02,291 --> 02:30:04,259
All the evidence said no.

2488
02:30:05,561 --> 02:30:07,791
Sherwood disqualified his handwriting.

2489
02:30:07,896 --> 02:30:11,024
The same Sherwood
that drinks like Paul Avery now?

2490
02:30:11,934 --> 02:30:13,868
<i>Yes, you have Sherwood Morrill
in writing saying,</i>

2491
02:30:13,969 --> 02:30:14,993
<i>"I'm sorry, this just won't work. "</i>

2492
02:30:15,103 --> 02:30:16,866
- But you also have Terry Pascoe...
- His protg.

2493
02:30:16,972 --> 02:30:17,996
<i>Yeah, fine, it's his protg,</i>

2494
02:30:18,106 --> 02:30:19,937
<i>but he's a handwriting expert
nonetheless, and he's saying,</i>

2495
02:30:20,042 --> 02:30:21,392
"Do not disqualify this suspect
on the basis of handwriting. "

2496
02:30:21,427 --> 02:30:22,743
"Do not disqualify this suspect
on the basis of handwriting. "

2497
02:30:22,845 --> 02:30:24,779
<i>- So the two cancel each other out.
- No, they don't.</i>

2498
02:30:24,880 --> 02:30:26,177
It was Sherwood's case.

2499
02:30:26,281 --> 02:30:27,748
He was the head
of Questioned Documents.

2500
02:30:27,850 --> 02:30:29,181
<i>If it went to trial,</i>

2501
02:30:29,284 --> 02:30:32,253
all the defense would have to do
is call Sherwood to the stand.

2502
02:30:32,354 --> 02:30:34,982
<i>And there was no way of getting Allen
into court in the first place,</i>

2503
02:30:35,090 --> 02:30:36,318
<i>because there was no evidence, Robert.</i>

2504
02:30:36,425 --> 02:30:37,585
<i>What do you mean,
there's no evidence?</i>

2505
02:30:37,693 --> 02:30:38,785
You have him seen with the ciphers.

2506
02:30:38,894 --> 02:30:41,124
The military boot prints.
The same size shoes and gloves.

2507
02:30:41,230 --> 02:30:43,425
<i>The Most Dangerous Game.
The Zodiac watch.</i>

2508
02:30:43,532 --> 02:30:44,726
The background with school children.

2509
02:30:44,833 --> 02:30:46,664
The misspellings of Christ-mass.
The bloody knives.

2510
02:30:46,768 --> 02:30:48,633
All circumstantial.

2511
02:30:48,737 --> 02:30:51,467
<i>Paul Stine's shirt, his wallet, his keys.</i>

2512
02:30:51,573 --> 02:30:53,336
We should have found
one of those things in that trailer.

2513
02:30:53,442 --> 02:30:55,137
- We didn't.
- That's...

2514
02:30:57,579 --> 02:30:59,570
Okay. Catherine Allen states that

2515
02:30:59,681 --> 02:31:01,808
"Leigh cleaned out his trailer
on Friday after work

2516
02:31:01,917 --> 02:31:05,580
<i>"and moved it to Santa Rosa
on Saturday, August 7th, 1971."</i>

2517
02:31:05,687 --> 02:31:07,678
You interviewed him
at the refinery on August 4th.

2518
02:31:07,789 --> 02:31:09,313
<i>- Yeah.
- So, he's cleaning out his trailer,</i>

2519
02:31:09,424 --> 02:31:13,258
he's moving into a different county
48 hours after you interviewed him?

2520
02:31:14,863 --> 02:31:17,855
<i>Okay. Okay.
Look at the stuff side by side, Dave.</i>

2521
02:31:17,966 --> 02:31:19,058
All right.

2522
02:31:19,167 --> 02:31:21,931
<i>Okay, Arthur Leigh Allen
and the Zodiac, their timelines.</i>

2523
02:31:22,037 --> 02:31:24,699
<i>- When was the first murder in Vallejo?
- Christmas, 1968.</i>

2524
02:31:24,806 --> 02:31:27,400
<i>Eight months before that,
Allen is fired for molesting his students</i>

2525
02:31:27,509 --> 02:31:29,602
and his family discovers
that he's a pedophile.

2526
02:31:29,711 --> 02:31:32,009
<i>- Now, when do the letters begin?
- July, '69.</i>

2527
02:31:32,114 --> 02:31:33,775
After the murder of Darlene Ferrin.

2528
02:31:33,882 --> 02:31:36,942
And they continue
until you go to see him at work.

2529
02:31:37,052 --> 02:31:40,283
<i>Now, after that, do any of the letters
contain swatches of Paul Stine's shirt?</i>

2530
02:31:40,389 --> 02:31:42,186
<i>No. Because he dumped them,
because he got scared.</i>

2531
02:31:42,291 --> 02:31:44,020
Because he knew
that you were on to him.

2532
02:31:44,126 --> 02:31:47,857
<i>- So, when's the next letter from Zodiac?
- Not until January of 1974.</i>

2533
02:31:47,963 --> 02:31:49,362
He is silent for three years.

2534
02:31:49,464 --> 02:31:51,261
<i>Then, in '74, he feels comfortable again</i>

2535
02:31:51,366 --> 02:31:53,231
because everybody's moved off
Allen as a suspect.

2536
02:31:53,335 --> 02:31:54,324
And what do we get?

2537
02:31:54,436 --> 02:31:58,429
<i>Three new letters from Zodiac
in January, May, and July in '74.</i>

2538
02:31:58,540 --> 02:32:01,634
- But then the letters stop.
- What happens to Allen?

2539
02:32:05,180 --> 02:32:06,647
He's arrested.

2540
02:32:07,583 --> 02:32:10,916
<i>January, 1975,
they send him to Atascadero.</i>

2541
02:32:11,019 --> 02:32:13,920
We don't get another letter from Zodiac
the entire time he's there.

2542
02:32:14,022 --> 02:32:16,650
<i>- When is he released?
- August, '77.</i>

2543
02:32:16,758 --> 02:32:20,489
<i>Allen gets out. He types you an apology,
and then what?</i>

2544
02:32:20,596 --> 02:32:23,759
We get our first new Zodiac letter
in four years.

2545
02:32:29,404 --> 02:32:32,771
<i>Okay. Zodiac had to have known
Darlene Ferrin, right?</i>

2546
02:32:32,874 --> 02:32:35,104
<i>Yes, because of the phone calls
on the night of her murder.</i>

2547
02:32:35,210 --> 02:32:38,008
<i>Because of the Vallejo file,</i>

2548
02:32:38,113 --> 02:32:40,104
we know that Darlene knew
a man named Leigh?

2549
02:32:40,215 --> 02:32:41,204
Yes.

2550
02:32:41,316 --> 02:32:43,079
<i>So, all coincidence aside, Robert,</i>

2551
02:32:43,185 --> 02:32:45,983
how can you be sure that Leigh Allen
is the Leigh from this file?

2552
02:32:46,088 --> 02:32:48,556
<i>Now, Vallejo is a small town,
but it's not that small.</i>

2553
02:32:48,657 --> 02:32:49,954
How do you put
the two of them together?

2554
02:32:50,058 --> 02:32:53,221
<i>This is a case that's covered
both Northern and Southern California,</i>

2555
02:32:53,328 --> 02:32:55,694
with victims and suspects
spread over hundreds of miles.

2556
02:32:55,797 --> 02:32:57,526
- Would you agree?
- Yes.

2557
02:32:58,800 --> 02:33:01,598
Darlene Ferrin worked
at the Vallejo House of Pancakes

2558
02:33:01,703 --> 02:33:04,194
on the corner of Tennessee and Caroll.

2559
02:33:07,042 --> 02:33:11,775
Arthur Leigh Allen lived in his
mother's basement on Fresno Street.

2560
02:33:13,515 --> 02:33:16,882
<i>Door to door, that is less than 50 yards.</i>

2561
02:33:20,322 --> 02:33:21,789
Is that true?

2562
02:33:22,824 --> 02:33:24,314
I've walked it.

2563
02:33:28,163 --> 02:33:29,596
Jesus Christ.

2564
02:33:36,304 --> 02:33:37,293
So?

2565
02:33:41,243 --> 02:33:42,801
<i>The prints, the handwriting...</i>

2566
02:33:42,911 --> 02:33:45,880
- I'm not asking you as a cop.
- But I am a cop.

2567
02:33:48,750 --> 02:33:50,775
I can't prove this.

2568
02:33:50,886 --> 02:33:53,821
<i>Just because you can't prove it,
doesn't mean it's not true.</i>

2569
02:33:53,922 --> 02:33:55,549
<i>Easy, Dirty Harry.</i>

2570
02:33:59,161 --> 02:34:00,685
Finish the book.

2571
02:34:09,638 --> 02:34:12,106
Thank you. Thank you for breakfast.

2572
02:35:20,375 --> 02:35:21,865
Can I help you?

2573
02:35:23,545 --> 02:35:24,534
No.

2574
02:36:45,927 --> 02:36:47,258
Mr. Mageau.

2575
02:36:47,963 --> 02:36:50,261
Thanks for coming to see me.

2576
02:36:50,365 --> 02:36:51,696
You're the one I talked to on the phone?

2577
02:36:51,800 --> 02:36:55,327
I'm George Bawart. Vallejo PD.
I took over for Jack Mulanax.

2578
02:36:56,371 --> 02:36:59,340
It's been 22 years.
I don't know how I can help you.

2579
02:36:59,441 --> 02:37:00,601
<i>Well, this is just a formality.</i>

2580
02:37:00,709 --> 02:37:02,108
I'm gonna show you
a group of photographs.

2581
02:37:02,210 --> 02:37:04,075
<i>Now, the person that shot you
may or may not be</i>

2582
02:37:04,179 --> 02:37:06,204
among these photographs.

2583
02:37:06,314 --> 02:37:07,508
You don't have to pick anybody out

2584
02:37:07,616 --> 02:37:09,777
<i>just because I'm showing you
these pictures, you understand?</i>

2585
02:37:09,885 --> 02:37:11,409
<i>Yes, sir, I do.</i>

2586
02:37:12,320 --> 02:37:13,651
All right.

2587
02:37:14,689 --> 02:37:16,179
Take your time.

2588
02:37:16,691 --> 02:37:19,489
<i>If you don't recognize anyone,
that's okay.</i>

2589
02:37:30,972 --> 02:37:32,303
That's him.

2590
02:37:33,808 --> 02:37:35,742
How sure are you?

2591
02:37:35,844 --> 02:37:37,675
<i>Yeah, I'm pretty sure.</i>

2592
02:37:40,382 --> 02:37:41,508
He had a round face like this guy.

2593
02:37:41,616 --> 02:37:42,810
Wait. Am I to understand

2594
02:37:42,918 --> 02:37:44,681
that you're now identifying
the second photograph?

2595
02:37:44,786 --> 02:37:47,846
<i>No, no. Just that
he had a round face like that.</i>

2596
02:37:49,925 --> 02:37:51,392
It's this man.

2597
02:37:52,327 --> 02:37:53,624
All right.

2598
02:37:55,463 --> 02:37:58,523
<i>Now, on a scale of one to 10,
10 being positive,</i>

2599
02:38:02,637 --> 02:38:04,229
how sure are you?

2600
02:38:08,009 --> 02:38:09,636
At least an eight.

2601
02:38:12,447 --> 02:38:16,281
<i>The last time I saw this face
was July 4th, 1969.</i>

2602
02:38:19,554 --> 02:38:22,250
I am very sure
that's the man who shot me.
