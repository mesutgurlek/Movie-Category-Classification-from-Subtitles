There was a vision,
on a white horse,

165
00:12:12,459 --> 00:12:17,630
that rides out every morning
between <i>prime</i> and <i>terce.</i>

166
00:12:17,698 --> 00:12:20,900
I am observed then.

167
00:12:20,968 --> 00:12:22,902
As are we.

168
00:12:22,970 --> 00:12:27,273
My husband does insist
I am accompanied.

169
00:12:27,308 --> 00:12:30,410
Can they be discreet?

170
00:12:30,477 --> 00:12:32,545
I see no need
for discretion.

171
00:12:34,548 --> 00:12:36,583
No need.

172
00:12:38,586 --> 00:12:40,753
Why do you have
spies, Cardinal?

173
00:12:40,821 --> 00:12:43,323
A cardinal must have spies.

174
00:12:43,424 --> 00:12:47,560
Does it displease you
that I searched you out?

175
00:12:47,628 --> 00:12:51,230
No. Far from it.

176
00:12:51,332 --> 00:12:55,101
There are many things that
please me about you, Cardinal.

177
00:12:55,169 --> 00:12:58,137
Among them, the fact
that you are a cardinal.

178
00:12:58,172 --> 00:13:01,307
Can you explain?

179
00:13:07,181 --> 00:13:09,949
If I can find the words.

180
00:13:12,853 --> 00:13:17,023
Your priestly collar makes me
hope my heart is safe.

181
00:13:19,526 --> 00:13:22,962
Because I am not fully
in command of it.

182
00:13:23,030 --> 00:13:25,865
So the fact that you are
a cardinal pleases me

183
00:13:25,933 --> 00:13:29,035
as it distresses me.

184
00:13:29,169 --> 00:13:32,772
I thought I would not be
cardinal for today.

185
00:13:35,109 --> 00:13:36,876
Then my heart is in danger.

186
00:13:36,944 --> 00:13:39,779
Would you endanger it,
Cardinal Borgia?

187
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:42,215
I would put it in fear
of its life.

188
00:13:42,349 --> 00:13:44,684
Ah.

189
00:13:44,785 --> 00:13:47,954
But I would never harm it.

190
00:13:50,858 --> 00:13:52,792
That sounds like a riddle.

191
00:13:52,860 --> 00:13:55,395
Are you good at riddles,
Cardinal Borgia?

192
00:13:55,462 --> 00:13:57,730
Sadly, I must live
in one.

193
00:13:57,831 --> 00:13:59,332
As must I.

194
00:14:22,256 --> 00:14:25,692
[Door creaking and closing]

195
00:14:30,931 --> 00:14:33,166
And your name is?

196
00:14:33,233 --> 00:14:36,903
Francesca.

197
00:14:42,276 --> 00:14:45,344
What do you know
of marriage, Francesca?

198
00:14:45,412 --> 00:14:49,515
I know, my lady,

199
00:14:49,583 --> 00:14:52,085
it should not be thus.

200
00:15:02,863 --> 00:15:05,732
It was retrieved from
a confessional in Florence.

201
00:15:07,801 --> 00:15:10,103
And it was not used
for opening letters?

202
00:15:10,204 --> 00:15:12,105
No, Your Eminence.

203
00:15:12,206 --> 00:15:15,441
It was found impaled in the eye
of a mendicant friar.

204
00:15:18,579 --> 00:15:22,148
And who impaled him?

205
00:15:22,282 --> 00:15:25,551
The one we commanded him
to follow.

206
00:15:29,823 --> 00:15:32,158
Can you do nothing right!?

207
00:15:35,095 --> 00:15:38,464
Blink once

208
00:15:38,565 --> 00:15:40,833
and you will be eyeless.

209
00:15:40,934 --> 00:15:45,938
And I would still serve you
without one eye, Your Eminence.

210
00:15:46,006 --> 00:15:48,674
Or without two.

211
00:15:50,511 --> 00:15:54,180
So we lost him
and you know not where?

212
00:15:54,314 --> 00:15:56,582
Milan.

213
00:15:58,519 --> 00:16:01,187
You should wear
a clown's hat.

214
00:16:07,027 --> 00:16:09,762
Della Rovere has left Florence.

215
00:16:09,863 --> 00:16:11,764
With or without satisfaction?

216
00:16:11,865 --> 00:16:14,367
We have the papal armies,
the Sforza armies,

217
00:16:14,434 --> 00:16:17,537
our allies in the Romagna
all under my command.

218
00:16:19,439 --> 00:16:22,308
To hell with Florence!

219
00:16:22,376 --> 00:16:25,945
My fear is the cardinal would
invite apocalypse.

220
00:16:27,714 --> 00:16:32,318
He would open the 7 seals?

221
00:16:32,386 --> 00:16:35,655
No, Father. Let us not talk
in metaphors.

222
00:16:35,722 --> 00:16:38,724
My fear is...

223
00:16:38,859 --> 00:16:40,893
he would go to France,

224
00:16:40,994 --> 00:16:43,663
conspire with the French
to invade us,

225
00:16:43,730 --> 00:16:45,865
arrange free passage
of their armies

226
00:16:45,899 --> 00:16:47,967
through the Republic
of Florence,

227
00:16:48,035 --> 00:16:50,403
through the Duchy
of Milan.

228
00:16:50,504 --> 00:16:53,306
- And the French King would...
- Depose you,

229
00:16:53,373 --> 00:16:57,243
march south to Naples.

230
00:16:57,344 --> 00:16:59,912
His armies are hardened
by a 100 years of battle

231
00:17:00,013 --> 00:17:02,682
with England. There is nothing
here to match them.

232
00:17:02,749 --> 00:17:05,751
Duke Ludovico Sforza
of Milan.

233
00:17:05,886 --> 00:17:08,020
He is cousin
to our sister's husband,

234
00:17:08,088 --> 00:17:10,223
Giovanni Sforza.
[Snicker from Cardinal]

235
00:17:10,324 --> 00:17:14,694
Lucrezia did not marry
Ludovico Sforza, Brother.

236
00:17:14,761 --> 00:17:17,430
And they don't call him
<i>Il Moro</i> for nothing.

237
00:17:19,366 --> 00:17:24,704
I hear he keeps his own cousin
caged beneath his castle floors.

238
00:17:24,771 --> 00:17:27,039
He would betray us
in a moment

239
00:17:27,107 --> 00:17:31,110
if he thought
his dukedom was in peril.

240
00:17:31,245 --> 00:17:33,779
What he fears

241
00:17:33,881 --> 00:17:37,116
is that his nephew will
wear his crown.

242
00:17:37,217 --> 00:17:40,686
Well,

243
00:17:40,787 --> 00:17:42,788
perhaps we should threaten him

244
00:17:42,856 --> 00:17:45,524
with just that possibility.

245
00:17:47,761 --> 00:17:51,264
And you should go to Florence

246
00:17:51,365 --> 00:17:54,133
tease out their intentions.

247
00:17:54,201 --> 00:17:56,702
Those Medici bankers

248
00:17:56,770 --> 00:17:59,538
have a preacher,

249
00:17:59,606 --> 00:18:02,308
Savonarola,

250
00:18:02,409 --> 00:18:05,444
who accuses them of usury.

251
00:18:09,650 --> 00:18:13,886
Perhaps we should offer them
an excommunication...

252
00:18:15,989 --> 00:18:18,991
...public burning

253
00:18:19,092 --> 00:18:23,629
if they support
our just cause.

254
00:18:36,543 --> 00:18:39,045
They call me <i>Il Moro,</i>
<i>Cardinal.</i>

255
00:18:39,112 --> 00:18:42,615
Can you imagine why?

256
00:18:42,649 --> 00:18:45,885
Because of Your Highness'
dark complexion?

257
00:18:45,986 --> 00:18:48,888
Because of my cunning.

258
00:18:48,956 --> 00:18:51,490
Like the Moors of old,

259
00:18:51,591 --> 00:18:54,193
I outwit them all.

260
00:18:54,261 --> 00:18:57,563
You will have given my proposal
the grace of your cunning then?

261
00:18:57,631 --> 00:19:01,534
Hmm...

262
00:19:01,601 --> 00:19:03,769
[Soft laughter]

263
00:19:03,904 --> 00:19:06,005
You...

264
00:19:06,073 --> 00:19:08,874
wish me to grant
French arms

265
00:19:08,942 --> 00:19:10,876
safe passage

266
00:19:10,944 --> 00:19:13,245
through the Duchy of Milan.

267
00:19:15,615 --> 00:19:18,751
But why would the French King
march south, hm?

268
00:19:18,785 --> 00:19:21,387
Because, most honourable duke,

269
00:19:21,455 --> 00:19:24,190
of his claims
on the Kingdom of Naples.

270
00:19:24,257 --> 00:19:28,961
Ah! The great game of Naples.

271
00:19:29,062 --> 00:19:32,565
Everybody wants Naples.

272
00:19:32,632 --> 00:19:34,533
My nephew,

273
00:19:34,601 --> 00:19:37,370
GIAN GALEAZZO,

274
00:19:37,471 --> 00:19:40,539
thinks it part
of his inheritance.

275
00:19:40,607 --> 00:19:43,976
But then...
[Laughter]

276
00:19:44,111 --> 00:19:47,913
He thinks Milan is his. Hm!

277
00:19:53,787 --> 00:19:56,822
AM I RIGHT, NEPHEW?

278
00:19:56,923 --> 00:19:59,725
You think it Christian

279
00:19:59,793 --> 00:20:02,561
to have him so caged?

280
00:20:02,662 --> 00:20:05,131
Until he comes
to his senses.

281
00:20:05,232 --> 00:20:09,301
WHO AM I?

282
00:20:09,336 --> 00:20:12,271
You are Ludovico Sforza.

283
00:20:12,339 --> 00:20:14,507
I am not the Duke of Milan?

284
00:20:14,608 --> 00:20:16,776
That title is mine.

285
00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:22,014
MINE!

286
00:20:22,149 --> 00:20:26,485
Admit it and you'll have
wine to drink.

287
00:20:35,462 --> 00:20:38,464
Politics is a delicate game.

288
00:20:40,467 --> 00:20:42,334
So I observe, my lord.

289
00:20:44,171 --> 00:20:46,172
You, Cardinal?

290
00:20:46,239 --> 00:20:48,641
Have you come to liberate him?

291
00:20:48,675 --> 00:20:50,576
I have come to ask

292
00:20:50,677 --> 00:20:52,845
for the safe passage
of French arms.

293
00:20:52,946 --> 00:20:55,014
Indeed.

294
00:20:55,082 --> 00:20:58,484
From the Duke of Milan.
[Snicker]

295
00:20:58,585 --> 00:21:00,986
Well, Cardinal.

296
00:21:01,021 --> 00:21:03,656
I will consider it.

297
00:21:03,757 --> 00:21:06,926
[Bell ringing]
[Woman in the distance]:
Fresh bread! Bread, bread!

298
00:21:07,027 --> 00:21:09,929
[Man in the distance]:
Cabbages this way! More cabbages
for your money! Over here!

299
00:21:10,030 --> 00:21:11,931
- You got 2 plump ones for me?
- Yes, of course, <i>signore.</i>

300
00:21:12,032 --> 00:21:14,100
- Well fed, are they?
- Fresh bread here!

301
00:21:14,201 --> 00:21:16,302
[Man]: Florence,
the time will come,

302
00:21:16,369 --> 00:21:18,304
when all your finery,

303
00:21:18,371 --> 00:21:22,708
goods, and chattels will
profit you nothing.

304
00:21:22,843 --> 00:21:27,546
You have lived in usury,
Florence, like pigs in heat.

305
00:21:27,647 --> 00:21:32,017
The riches of your banking may
astound the world,

306
00:21:32,119 --> 00:21:37,723
but one day
they will be your undoing!

307
00:21:37,858 --> 00:21:41,460
Owing to your avarice,
neither you

308
00:21:41,528 --> 00:21:44,497
nor your children lead
a good life.

309
00:21:44,564 --> 00:21:46,899
You have already discovered

310
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,668
many devices of gaining money...

311
00:21:49,736 --> 00:21:52,671
It was rumoured a cardinal had
graced Florence with his presence.

312
00:21:52,739 --> 00:21:56,408
...which you call just,
and are most unjust.

313
00:21:56,476 --> 00:21:58,377
- You are?
- Niccolo Machiavelli.

314
00:21:58,411 --> 00:22:00,579
...likewise has...

315
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:02,581
Ambassador of the
House of Medici.

316
00:22:02,682 --> 00:22:06,385
...corrupted the magistrates
and their functions.

317
00:22:06,419 --> 00:22:10,589
This friar would burn
your Florence to the ground.

318
00:22:10,657 --> 00:22:12,658
Not quite.

319
00:22:12,726 --> 00:22:16,328
Oh, no one can persuade you
it is sinful to lend at usury.

320
00:22:16,396 --> 00:22:18,330
He would reduce us
to his own status.

321
00:22:18,398 --> 00:22:20,099
...and make
unjust bargains...

322
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:22,101
- Which is?
- ...on the contrary...

323
00:22:22,202 --> 00:22:24,937
A pile of straw
on a monastery floor.

324
00:22:25,071 --> 00:22:27,506
- ...you defend yourselves.
- He disapproves...

325
00:22:27,574 --> 00:22:29,508
...to your souls' damnation!

326
00:22:29,576 --> 00:22:33,579
...of display,
ornament, artistry.

327
00:22:33,613 --> 00:22:35,548
- Nor does any man...
- Even comfort.

328
00:22:35,582 --> 00:22:37,483
...take shame to himself...

329
00:22:37,551 --> 00:22:41,987
Perhaps Cardinal Cesare Borgia
can be of some help.

330
00:22:42,055 --> 00:22:45,858
He would meet with my master,
Piero de Medici?

331
00:22:45,926 --> 00:22:48,427
- ...fools who refrain from it.
- No.

332
00:22:48,528 --> 00:22:50,429
He would meet with you,
Ambassador.

333
00:22:50,530 --> 00:22:53,566
Thus, thy fulfilled
the saying of Isaiah-

334
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:56,202
Aha, a conspiracy then.

335
00:22:56,269 --> 00:22:58,003
"They declare their sin
as Sodom"

336
00:22:58,071 --> 00:23:03,008
No.
More like an inquisition.

337
00:23:03,076 --> 00:23:05,945
...and of Jeremiah,
"Thou hast a whore's forehead."

338
00:23:06,012 --> 00:23:09,548
Perhaps you should
follow me.

339
00:23:09,616 --> 00:23:12,785
"...thou refusedst
to be ashamed."

340
00:23:12,886 --> 00:23:14,787
Another cardinal came
through here

341
00:23:14,888 --> 00:23:17,456
some days ago.

342
00:23:17,524 --> 00:23:22,061
He left his mark, I believe,
on a confessional door.

343
00:23:22,128 --> 00:23:25,864
There was
a friar found murdered.

344
00:23:25,932 --> 00:23:29,134
But that cardinal claimed
to be a man of peace.

345
00:23:29,202 --> 00:23:32,471
We all do,
<i>Signor</i> Machiavelli.

346
00:23:32,572 --> 00:23:35,140
You make the same claims?

347
00:23:35,242 --> 00:23:37,943
For the moment.

348
00:23:37,978 --> 00:23:39,945
But I would hazard,

349
00:23:39,980 --> 00:23:41,747
if this cardinal passed
through Florence,

350
00:23:41,815 --> 00:23:44,253
he did more than pinion
a mendicant friar to

351
00:23:44,254 --> 00:23:45,380
a confessional door.

352
00:23:45,385 --> 00:23:48,487
- You would?
- Yes, I would hazard he met

353
00:23:48,555 --> 00:23:52,391
with the Florentine ambassador
and his master, de Medici.

354
00:23:52,459 --> 00:23:55,494
And <i>if</i> he did?

355
00:23:55,629 --> 00:23:58,597
I would hazard there was
a purpose to that meeting.

356
00:23:58,665 --> 00:24:01,066
The purpose being?

357
00:24:01,167 --> 00:24:04,303
That Florence unite
with his cause.

358
00:24:04,337 --> 00:24:08,974
No. On the contrary.
He asked for nothing.

359
00:24:09,009 --> 00:24:11,844
Nothing?

360
00:24:11,911 --> 00:24:13,846
Or, to be more specific,

361
00:24:13,913 --> 00:24:15,848
he asked
that Florence...

362
00:24:15,915 --> 00:24:19,952
do...
nothing.

363
00:24:20,020 --> 00:24:22,021
He requested
that Florence do nothing,

364
00:24:22,155 --> 00:24:26,325
in the event
of a great something.

365
00:24:30,030 --> 00:24:32,331
You are far too clever
for a cardinal.

366
00:24:32,432 --> 00:24:34,333
The times have
made me so.

367
00:24:34,434 --> 00:24:38,437
He requested
that Florence do nothing,

368
00:24:38,505 --> 00:24:42,207
and allow a great passage
of arms through its republic.

369
00:24:44,277 --> 00:24:46,612
Perhaps.

370
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:49,214
And Florence promised him?

371
00:24:51,184 --> 00:24:54,520
Why should I tell you
what Florence told him?

372
00:24:57,490 --> 00:24:59,224
I could perhaps ensure

373
00:24:59,359 --> 00:25:02,161
that instead
of your beautiful Florence,

374
00:25:02,228 --> 00:25:06,231
Friar Savonarola
himself burns.

375
00:25:06,366 --> 00:25:09,635
Hmph!

376
00:25:09,703 --> 00:25:13,172
An impressive offer.

377
00:25:13,239 --> 00:25:17,643
So, Florence offered
the good cardinal?

378
00:25:17,744 --> 00:25:20,379
What he offered Florence.

379
00:25:20,413 --> 00:25:23,582
Nothing.

380
00:25:26,853 --> 00:25:30,422
So the arms of France cannot
pass through your fair republic?

381
00:25:30,557 --> 00:25:33,926
In a sentence.

382
00:25:33,993 --> 00:25:35,828
And if these times have made
you clever,

383
00:25:35,929 --> 00:25:41,100
the coming months may thrust
genius upon you.

384
00:26:03,923 --> 00:26:05,958
My lord is...

385
00:26:08,261 --> 00:26:10,195
My lady.

386
00:26:10,263 --> 00:26:12,097
Forgive me
for startling you.

387
00:26:12,198 --> 00:26:15,467
My lord is hunting.

388
00:26:15,568 --> 00:26:17,469
Would my lady have me saddle
her a horse so she can

389
00:26:17,570 --> 00:26:18,708
ride out after him?

390
00:26:18,725 --> 00:26:21,025
There is nothing your
lady would like less.

391
00:26:26,045 --> 00:26:30,282
He is a good huntsman,
your lord?

392
00:26:30,316 --> 00:26:33,085
No deer is safe from him.

393
00:26:33,153 --> 00:26:36,221
Pity the poor deer then.

394
00:26:36,289 --> 00:26:38,991
But at least
their agony ends.

395
00:26:39,092 --> 00:26:44,096
Yes. He's a clean killer.

396
00:26:44,164 --> 00:26:46,999
And your name is?

397
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:49,234
Paolo.

398
00:26:52,505 --> 00:26:54,506
Your shirt is torn, Paolo.

399
00:26:56,509 --> 00:26:58,744
Would you like me
to stitch it?

400
00:26:58,812 --> 00:27:00,746
I could never ask, my lady.

401
00:27:00,814 --> 00:27:04,783
And stop this "my lady"
nonsense.

402
00:27:04,851 --> 00:27:07,853
My name is Lucrezia.

403
00:27:09,789 --> 00:27:12,191
Say it.

404
00:27:12,325 --> 00:27:15,694
Lucrezia...
my lady.

405
00:27:15,795 --> 00:27:18,330
...in summation,
Your Holiness,

406
00:27:18,364 --> 00:27:20,332
I would reiterate

407
00:27:20,366 --> 00:27:23,035
his Highness' pleasure
at the possibility

408
00:27:23,102 --> 00:27:26,104
of an union between
the Kingdom of Navarre

409
00:27:26,172 --> 00:27:28,207
and the Borgia family.

410
00:27:28,274 --> 00:27:31,677
Between the <i>Gonfaloniere</i>
<i>Juan Borgia</i>

411
00:27:31,778 --> 00:27:37,115
and his beloved niece,
the Princess Sylvia,

412
00:27:37,183 --> 00:27:39,151
whose portrait is
now my pleasure

413
00:27:39,219 --> 00:27:43,055
to present
to the Papal Court.

414
00:27:48,561 --> 00:27:50,562
We thank his Royal Highness.

415
00:27:50,663 --> 00:27:54,399
And if this depiction
does justice

416
00:27:54,467 --> 00:27:56,401
to the Princess Sylvia,

417
00:27:56,503 --> 00:27:58,971
then her beauty

418
00:27:59,072 --> 00:28:03,141
is indeed without compare.

419
00:28:06,679 --> 00:28:10,983
Her reputation...
does precede her.

420
00:28:13,086 --> 00:28:16,688
We will consider
your gracious suit

421
00:28:16,756 --> 00:28:19,258
in the fullness of time.

422
00:28:31,204 --> 00:28:34,940
And do the horses
have names, Paolo?

423
00:28:35,074 --> 00:28:37,676
Indeed they do, my lady.

424
00:28:37,744 --> 00:28:40,913
- Lucrezia.
- My lady Lucrezia.

425
00:28:43,283 --> 00:28:45,417
This is Diablo.

426
00:28:45,451 --> 00:28:47,286
The devil.

427
00:28:47,387 --> 00:28:49,254
Yes.

428
00:28:49,289 --> 00:28:51,256
He was the devil for speed
until he tumbled on a break

429
00:28:51,291 --> 00:28:54,893
and shattered his hoof.
And now?

430
00:28:54,961 --> 00:28:57,963
His fire is gone entirely.

431
00:28:58,031 --> 00:29:01,099
He will end up pulling hay.

432
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:04,736
There are worse
fates, Paolo.

433
00:29:08,107 --> 00:29:11,276
And this one?

434
00:29:11,377 --> 00:29:15,080
An Arab mare...
Fatima.

435
00:29:15,148 --> 00:29:17,055
One could not have
them in the same stable

436
00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:18,183
when he was in his prime.

437
00:29:18,184 --> 00:29:21,453
But after his break...
He was chastened.

438
00:29:21,554 --> 00:29:24,690
He is like a mare
himself now, my lady.

439
00:29:26,726 --> 00:29:29,127
Lucky Fatima.

440
00:29:29,262 --> 00:29:31,797
She can sleep
well at night.

441
00:29:36,369 --> 00:29:39,304
Show me your hands, Paolo.

442
00:29:39,405 --> 00:29:41,907
Bring them here.

443
00:29:41,975 --> 00:29:44,443
I would touch them.

444
00:29:46,546 --> 00:29:48,547
Soft.

445
00:29:50,483 --> 00:29:53,619
Will they be hard some day?

446
00:29:53,653 --> 00:29:55,988
I know not, my lady.

447
00:29:56,055 --> 00:29:58,256
Lucrezia.

448
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:05,497
♪ I took a bow
and aimed it low ♪

449
00:30:05,598 --> 00:30:07,599

00:30:30,089 --> 00:30:33,458

454
00:30:33,526 --> 00:30:36,094
Lucrezia.

455
00:30:36,162 --> 00:30:38,864
Say it.

456
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,335
Lucrezia.

457
00:30:49,142 --> 00:30:51,710
She is ugly, Father.

458
00:30:51,778 --> 00:30:53,612
No more than all the others.

459
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:55,447
They are all ugly.

460
00:30:58,384 --> 00:31:00,385
I'll marry none of them.

461
00:31:00,486 --> 00:31:02,014
Second-rate royalty,

462
00:31:02,689 --> 00:31:05,581
cousins of half-brothers
of princes.

463
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:12,064
I'll marry a king's daughter
or nothing.

464
00:31:12,165 --> 00:31:16,735
Nothing, I'm afraid,
is not an option, my dear son.

465
00:31:16,803 --> 00:31:19,638
Let Joffre marry instead.
King Ferrante of Naples

466
00:31:19,706 --> 00:31:21,740
has an illegitimate daughter.

467
00:31:25,211 --> 00:31:29,314
- Sancia.
- And the pope does need some

468
00:31:29,415 --> 00:31:31,750
security in Naples.

469
00:31:33,686 --> 00:31:38,657
A union between you and Sancia

470
00:31:38,758 --> 00:31:41,493
could have some benefits.

471
00:31:41,594 --> 00:31:43,395
Are you deaf, father?

472
00:31:43,496 --> 00:31:45,931
She is the half-bred bastard
of an ailing dotard.

473
00:31:46,032 --> 00:31:50,001
Let Joffre marry her.
I will marry a true princess

474
00:31:50,069 --> 00:31:52,738
or I will take my pleasures
where I find them.

475
00:31:55,775 --> 00:31:58,110
[Laughter]

476
00:31:58,211 --> 00:32:00,579
Your Holiness--

477
00:32:00,613 --> 00:32:03,215
Forgive me, Cardinal,

478
00:32:03,282 --> 00:32:06,618
I had hoped to find you alone.

479
00:32:06,719 --> 00:32:09,688
And, Your Holiness,
my cousin was just, huh...

480
00:32:09,789 --> 00:32:11,957
- Your cousin?
- Gabriella Visconti,

481
00:32:12,024 --> 00:32:13,692
at your service.

482
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:16,962
A Sforza?

483
00:32:17,029 --> 00:32:18,188
Twice removed.

484
00:32:18,213 --> 00:32:20,080
Well, we would hope
more than twice.

485
00:32:22,702 --> 00:32:26,938
Well, Cardinal,
you are awash with cousins,

486
00:32:26,973 --> 00:32:30,041
which is why we wish
to speak with you.

487
00:32:30,109 --> 00:32:33,311
At Your Holiness' pleasure.

488
00:32:38,584 --> 00:32:40,986
We would discuss
another cousin,

489
00:32:43,790 --> 00:32:47,893
in whose hands the survival
of our papacy may lie.

490
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:50,662
Your Holiness refers
to the Duke of Milan?

491
00:32:50,730 --> 00:32:55,901
Indeed. Cardinal Della Rovere
heads there as we speak.

492
00:32:56,002 --> 00:32:58,236
Well, if I can be
of any assistance...

493
00:32:58,337 --> 00:33:01,807
Well, you could disembowel
the dear cardinal.

494
00:33:01,908 --> 00:33:06,077
Does the office of
vice-chancellor extend so far?

495
00:33:06,179 --> 00:33:10,849
To include executions?
Sadly not.

496
00:33:10,950 --> 00:33:13,985
But you could inform
your cousin, the Duke of Milan,

497
00:33:14,020 --> 00:33:16,087
that we could well see

498
00:33:16,155 --> 00:33:18,824
the justice
of his nephew's cause,

499
00:33:18,958 --> 00:33:21,293
should the duke choose

500
00:33:21,327 --> 00:33:24,963
to act against our wishes.

501
00:33:34,740 --> 00:33:37,142
Is your betrothed old,
Francesca?

502
00:33:37,176 --> 00:33:40,412
Nine months older
than me, my lady.

503
00:33:40,513 --> 00:33:43,515
You are lucky then.

504
00:33:43,583 --> 00:33:47,185
The older male is like a boar.

505
00:33:47,320 --> 00:33:49,788
He bristles with hair.

506
00:33:49,856 --> 00:33:53,024
And when he doesn't beat,

507
00:33:53,092 --> 00:33:56,595
he thrusts.

508
00:33:56,662 --> 00:33:58,697
Did he beat last night?

509
00:33:58,764 --> 00:34:02,334
No, but he thrusted.

510
00:34:04,303 --> 00:34:06,771
I counted 27 of them.

511
00:34:06,839 --> 00:34:08,940
32 the night before.

512
00:34:09,008 --> 00:34:11,176
Already, more bearable.

513
00:34:11,310 --> 00:34:14,412
You must quicken his pleasure.

514
00:34:14,513 --> 00:34:16,281
Is that possible?

515
00:34:16,349 --> 00:34:20,018
Indeed. You can reduce it
to single figures.

516
00:34:20,119 --> 00:34:23,822
And for the sake
of one's own endurance,

517
00:34:23,856 --> 00:34:25,590
I find it helps to count.

518
00:34:25,691 --> 00:34:27,692
To count?

519
00:34:27,793 --> 00:34:30,128
Sheep.

520
00:34:32,164 --> 00:34:35,200
[Laughter]

521
00:34:37,103 --> 00:34:39,671
Sancia of Naples.

522
00:34:39,705 --> 00:34:43,208
- What of her?
- Is she beautiful?

523
00:34:43,309 --> 00:34:45,310
In the Neapolitan way.

524
00:34:45,378 --> 00:34:48,146
Ooh, what way is that,
my love?

525
00:34:48,214 --> 00:34:50,682
Dark.

526
00:34:50,716 --> 00:34:54,386
Sicilian.
Almost Moorish.

527
00:34:54,520 --> 00:34:58,156
And I have heard
her temper is Sicilian too.

528
00:34:58,224 --> 00:35:01,726
Would she make a bride for-

529
00:35:01,827 --> 00:35:04,329
Juan?

530
00:35:04,397 --> 00:35:08,633
A match made in...

531
00:35:08,701 --> 00:35:10,543
Where?

532
00:35:10,568 --> 00:35:12,181
Wherever such matches are made.

533
00:35:16,208 --> 00:35:18,209
No, not Juan.

534
00:35:18,277 --> 00:35:21,279
Juan will do what Juan will do.

535
00:35:21,347 --> 00:35:23,648
Cesare? Now that would be--

536
00:35:23,716 --> 00:35:26,551
No, you know Cesare can
never marry.

537
00:35:26,652 --> 00:35:29,854
No, for...

538
00:35:29,956 --> 00:35:32,457
for Joffre.

539
00:35:32,525 --> 00:35:35,026
Good God.

540
00:35:42,835 --> 00:35:46,037
Will you never stop?

541
00:35:48,908 --> 00:35:50,575
Never.

542
00:35:50,676 --> 00:35:55,313
You are going to ensnare
the whole of Europe

543
00:35:55,414 --> 00:35:57,749
in your progeny.

544
00:35:59,085 --> 00:36:03,655
What else are families
for, hm?

545
00:36:10,930 --> 00:36:14,866
Ah! 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.

546
00:36:14,934 --> 00:36:16,935
What?
What are you saying?

547
00:36:17,036 --> 00:36:18,603
I am counting, my lord.

548
00:36:18,671 --> 00:36:21,673
- Counting?
- Sheep, my lord.

549
00:36:21,774 --> 00:36:24,409
Could you count in silence?

550
00:36:41,227 --> 00:36:45,030
Counting sheep.

551
00:36:45,097 --> 00:36:47,699
Can she sleep now?

552
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:50,969
I truly hope so.

553
00:37:09,288 --> 00:37:12,791
You disappoint me, Cardinal.

554
00:37:16,395 --> 00:37:19,297
We are family, after all.

555
00:37:19,365 --> 00:37:22,801
If I am your cousin, my liege,

556
00:37:22,902 --> 00:37:25,470
I am also cousin
to your cousin, Gian Galeazzo,

557
00:37:25,604 --> 00:37:28,473
who lays claim
to your throne.

558
00:37:28,574 --> 00:37:30,942
This Borgia pope threatens--

559
00:37:30,976 --> 00:37:33,378
No, His Holiness does
not threaten.

560
00:37:33,446 --> 00:37:35,380
His Holiness merely reminds
the duke

561
00:37:35,448 --> 00:37:38,483
of where his best interests lie.

562
00:37:38,584 --> 00:37:40,485
And in the event
of a French invasion--

563
00:37:40,586 --> 00:37:42,954
He would pretend
to see the justice

564
00:37:42,988 --> 00:37:45,323
of this pretender's cause--

565
00:37:45,424 --> 00:37:47,058
As we would hope
that you would see--

[Growl]

567

AH! A CHAMPION! AT LAST,
YOU SNIVELING PRETENDER,

YOU HAVE A CHAMPION!

569
00:37:58,003 --> 00:38:02,340
You would release him, Cardinal?

570
00:38:02,441 --> 00:38:04,676
My lord, I would not be
so precipitous--

571
00:38:04,810 --> 00:38:08,980
No, but I insist!
Release him!

572
00:38:09,014 --> 00:38:12,016
Have him dine with us tonight!

573
00:38:12,118 --> 00:38:15,153
What is it you hunger
for most!?

574
00:38:16,822 --> 00:38:19,524
Freedom.
And pheasant.

575
00:38:19,592 --> 00:38:25,697
So, Cardinal. Let us feed
that hunger of his, hmm?

[Short kiss on head]

577
00:38:31,303 --> 00:38:35,206
Freedom and
pheasant it is.

00:38:43,149 --> 00:38:47,218
He wolfs his pheasant so.

Indeed.

582
00:38:55,394 --> 00:38:58,062
You are the Duke now,
are you not?

583
00:38:58,130 --> 00:39:00,498
Have mine.

584
00:39:06,539 --> 00:39:10,875
And you,
cousin cardinal,

585
00:39:10,976 --> 00:39:13,211
can tell that Borgia pope,

586
00:39:13,345 --> 00:39:15,213
that Catalan clown,

587
00:39:15,347 --> 00:39:18,116
that Spanish nonentity

that marries
his bastard daughter

589
00:39:19,718 --> 00:39:23,555
to my cousin and thinks
he will buy my friendship!

590
00:39:23,689 --> 00:39:25,557
Tell him he will never have it!

591
00:39:25,658 --> 00:39:27,859
Tell him I will welcome

of my own!

Thank you, my lady.

602
00:40:10,169 --> 00:40:12,270
Some tasks one must
perform oneself.

603

- Such as?
- Distribution of alms.

604
00:40:16,008 --> 00:40:19,344
In the convent of St. Cecilia,
there are many hungry souls.

Of what?
Of loaves of bread?

I beg you, heed it not.
It is in his nature.

And it is not in yours.
So heed it not.

Yes.

that I would not put myself

You are the most beautiful
thing I have yet seen.

658
00:44:39,738 --> 00:44:42,173
Lift me down.

659
00:44:51,350 --> 00:44:54,151
I could adjust his saddle.

660
00:44:54,186 --> 00:44:58,856
You could adjust
my lord's saddle

661
00:44:58,924 --> 00:45:01,025
He would fall.

662
00:45:01,159 --> 00:45:05,363
He would break.

663
00:45:05,430 --> 00:45:07,965
He would return home,

664
00:45:08,033 --> 00:45:10,535
tamed.

665
00:45:10,602 --> 00:45:13,371
Broken.

666
00:45:15,107 --> 00:45:18,643
- What if he died?
- From a fall? He would never.

667
00:45:20,612 --> 00:45:23,714
What if I had you whipped
for wickedness?

668
00:45:23,815 --> 00:45:25,716
You would never.

669
00:45:25,817 --> 00:45:29,887
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

670
00:45:30,022 --> 00:45:32,623
Of that I am sure.

671
00:45:32,691 --> 00:45:36,227
The cardinal was shocked
to the core.

672
00:45:36,361 --> 00:45:39,897
Apparently, he dropped dead
right in front of him

673
00:45:39,998 --> 00:45:41,999
at the duke's table.

674
00:45:42,067 --> 00:45:44,902
Poison.

675
00:45:44,970 --> 00:45:47,805
So it is rumoured.

676
00:45:47,873 --> 00:45:51,809
Gluttony, it is said.

677
00:45:51,910 --> 00:45:54,078
But the result's the same.

678
00:45:56,181 --> 00:45:58,015
If the French army moves,

679
00:45:58,083 --> 00:46:01,919
it will have free passage
through Milan.

680
00:46:01,987 --> 00:46:05,089
And the only force to stop it
will be Florence.

681
00:46:07,759 --> 00:46:10,561
And Florence can
hardly stand alone.

682
00:46:14,700 --> 00:46:19,070
No, I think it might be time
to give Naples what they want.

683
00:46:19,104 --> 00:46:21,772
An alliance?

684
00:46:21,873 --> 00:46:24,842
Better than that.

685
00:46:24,943 --> 00:46:27,378
A wedding!

686
00:46:29,348 --> 00:46:31,916
Who this time, Father? Me?

687
00:46:36,054 --> 00:46:39,290
Ah! Five... Six...

688
00:46:39,358 --> 00:46:42,126
[Whimpers]

689
00:46:42,194 --> 00:46:44,295
Seven...
[Grunts]

690
00:46:44,396 --> 00:46:47,131
Eight...
[Restrained sob]

691
00:46:47,232 --> 00:46:51,469
Nine...
[Grunts]

692
00:46:51,536 --> 00:46:54,905
Eleven...
[Whimpers]

693
00:46:54,973 --> 00:46:57,108
Twelve.
[Whimpers and grunts]

694
00:47:56,702 --> 00:47:58,869
My wife is to receive
no visitors

695
00:47:58,937 --> 00:48:02,139
in my absence.
Yes, my lord.

696
00:48:11,683 --> 00:48:13,784
You should let me deal with
him, Your Eminence.

697
00:48:15,787 --> 00:48:18,689
Did he insult
your mother?

698
00:48:18,724 --> 00:48:20,991
Then we should
both do it.

699
00:48:22,994 --> 00:48:26,530
Where would the valour
be in that?

700
00:48:29,568 --> 00:48:33,070
Or the pleasure?

701
00:48:33,171 --> 00:48:36,040
No.

702
00:48:36,074 --> 00:48:39,543
I shall do this...

703
00:48:39,644 --> 00:48:41,879
alone.

704
00:48:53,759 --> 00:48:56,060
An accident, my lady.

705
00:48:56,094 --> 00:48:58,095
The Lord Sforza.

706
00:48:58,196 --> 00:49:01,332
[Cat purring]

707
00:49:15,547 --> 00:49:19,550
You, Cardinal, have been
nosing round my wife.

708
00:49:19,618 --> 00:49:23,287
And you, Baron,
slandered my mother.

709
00:49:23,388 --> 00:49:25,890
You mean the Spanish whore?

710
00:49:28,360 --> 00:49:30,561
I mean my mother.

711
00:49:30,629 --> 00:49:34,431
From the whorehouse to the
Vatican is quite a journey.

712
00:49:34,466 --> 00:49:37,368
But it ends here.

713
00:49:39,371 --> 00:49:42,106
[Whinnying]
- Ah!
- Oh!

714
00:49:53,585 --> 00:49:55,820
[Clanging swords]

715
00:50:00,959 --> 00:50:06,096
[Cry of agony]

716
00:50:12,504 --> 00:50:15,906
Your wife prayed
for liberation.

717
00:50:15,974 --> 00:50:19,844
<i>Libera me domine</i>
<i>de morte aeterna.</i>

718
00:50:29,921 --> 00:50:32,656
You never forget
your first.

719
00:50:32,757 --> 00:50:36,360
Lift!
I felt the life go from him.

720
00:50:36,428 --> 00:50:39,463
Better him than you. But at
least you are still breathing.

721
00:50:45,904 --> 00:50:48,606
Was I in harm's way,
Micheletto?

722
00:50:48,673 --> 00:50:52,009
Not for a moment,
Your Eminence.

723
00:50:59,584 --> 00:51:02,686
- Leave me alone!
- It is a break, my lord,

724
00:51:02,687 --> 00:51:04,655
but you will survive it.
Water, please.

725
00:51:04,689 --> 00:51:06,364
A muslin cloth
and a splint,

726
00:51:06,389 --> 00:51:07,906
a piece of wood
between his teeth.

727
00:51:08,760 --> 00:51:10,928
My husband!

728
00:51:11,029 --> 00:51:13,097
Forgive me, my lord.

729
00:51:13,164 --> 00:51:16,100
You will feel some pain.
Be brave, my husband.

730
00:51:16,201 --> 00:51:18,168
On the count of 3.

731
00:51:18,203 --> 00:51:21,705
1, 2,

732
00:51:21,730 --> 00:51:22,930
3.

733
00:51:23,498 --> 00:51:28,000
[Crack!]
[Scream of pain]

734
00:51:31,483 --> 00:51:33,717
You killed this man
with grace, Your Eminence.

735
00:51:33,818 --> 00:51:36,020
You should be proud.

736
00:51:37,989 --> 00:51:41,659
- Will I be thanked for it?
- In my experience,

737
00:51:41,726 --> 00:51:44,461
one rarely is.

738
00:51:44,529 --> 00:51:47,298
A thankless task then.

739
00:51:47,365 --> 00:51:51,201
The river will be grateful
for him, Your Eminence.

740
00:51:51,303 --> 00:51:54,405
It loves a skewered corpse.

741
