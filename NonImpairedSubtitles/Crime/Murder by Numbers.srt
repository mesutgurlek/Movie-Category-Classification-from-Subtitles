1
00:02:18,583 --> 00:02:20,710
Should we say it one last time?

2
00:02:20,919 --> 00:02:24,912
One cannot live fully
without embracing suicide and crime.

3
00:02:25,457 --> 00:02:26,719
Say it.

4
00:02:26,925 --> 00:02:31,191
A pact made with relentless fire
that requires that some live...

5
00:02:31,396 --> 00:02:32,920
...others die.

6
00:02:33,598 --> 00:02:34,826
On three.

7
00:02:35,033 --> 00:02:36,261
One...

8
00:02:39,037 --> 00:02:40,937
...two...

9
00:02:42,207 --> 00:02:43,196
...three!

10
00:02:46,244 --> 00:02:49,702
Each of us has within us
a weak aspect...

11
00:02:49,915 --> 00:02:53,146
...eager to give up freedom
to be dominated.

12
00:02:53,351 --> 00:02:57,583
But we also have a will that
desires freedom, that insists...

13
00:02:57,789 --> 00:03:01,418
...on deciding for ourselves,
each of us individually...

14
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:03,953
...what is good...

15
00:03:04,162 --> 00:03:05,686
...and what is evil.

16
00:03:08,266 --> 00:03:10,063
Are there any questions?

17
00:03:14,706 --> 00:03:17,937
Doesn't anyone want to challenge
Justin's thesis?

18
00:03:18,143 --> 00:03:22,239
Do you all submit to this
Darwinian struggle of egos?

19
00:03:22,447 --> 00:03:23,880
I got a question.

20
00:03:24,216 --> 00:03:26,616
Mr. Haywood, you're awake!

21
00:03:26,885 --> 00:03:28,216
Let's hear it.

22
00:03:29,721 --> 00:03:32,451
What's a dork like you
know about power?

23
00:03:32,657 --> 00:03:35,820
What would an ass like you
know about philosophy?

24
00:03:36,027 --> 00:03:37,460
Keep it civil.

25
00:03:38,396 --> 00:03:41,058
Are you talking about crime?

26
00:03:41,299 --> 00:03:43,563
You should wake up more often.

27
00:03:43,769 --> 00:03:46,602
-What about it?
-All freedom risks crime.

28
00:03:46,805 --> 00:03:51,242
Freedom is crime. It thinks of itself
and not of the group.

29
00:03:52,811 --> 00:03:55,974
-Thank you, Justin. Very daring.
-Thank you.

30
00:03:58,416 --> 00:04:02,284
For those of you interested
in the source of his report...

31
00:04:02,454 --> 00:04:04,319
...take a look at Nietzsche.

32
00:04:04,489 --> 00:04:07,947
You really need to get laid,
Bonaparte.

33
00:04:22,507 --> 00:04:23,838
Hey, Justin.

34
00:04:28,613 --> 00:04:31,673
-Remember me?
-What do you want?

35
00:04:32,851 --> 00:04:35,479
I want to blow your brains out.

36
00:04:36,188 --> 00:04:38,679
And I'll make it look like a suicide.

37
00:04:39,224 --> 00:04:42,853
Everyone would believe that
you killed yourself.

38
00:04:43,061 --> 00:04:44,858
You won't get away with it.

39
00:04:45,063 --> 00:04:49,659
Your shoe prints are unique.
They'd be traced back to you.

40
00:04:49,868 --> 00:04:52,769
The fibers on your shirt
are all over me.

41
00:04:52,971 --> 00:04:54,404
Your hair too.

42
00:04:54,706 --> 00:04:56,640
It's called transference.

43
00:05:01,246 --> 00:05:04,215
More importantly, your fingerprints...

44
00:05:05,717 --> 00:05:07,207
...on my neck...

45
00:05:07,719 --> 00:05:10,051
...where you touched me.

46
00:05:12,958 --> 00:05:16,155
-You can't get them off skin.
-You can with a Magna-Brush...

47
00:05:16,394 --> 00:05:21,525
...or a fingerprint cam or an iodine gun
and silver transfer sheets.

48
00:05:21,733 --> 00:05:25,897
You don't have the discipline
to commit a murder.

49
00:05:26,905 --> 00:05:28,338
Is that right?

50
00:05:29,741 --> 00:05:31,003
Let's see.

51
00:05:35,413 --> 00:05:37,142
Bang!

52
00:05:37,582 --> 00:05:39,072
You're dead.

53
00:05:40,752 --> 00:05:44,119
What took you so long?
I've been waiting.

54
00:05:44,589 --> 00:05:47,080
No, I have something better.

55
00:05:48,860 --> 00:05:52,591
-What is it?
-Absinthe. Wormwood-infused alcohol.

56
00:05:52,931 --> 00:05:57,163
The molecular structure is almost
identical to tetrahedral chlorine.

57
00:05:57,869 --> 00:05:59,598
Tetra what?

58
00:05:59,871 --> 00:06:03,170
The active ingredient in marijuana.

59
00:06:06,778 --> 00:06:08,268
Where did you get it?

60
00:06:08,546 --> 00:06:10,878
Poets drank it for inspiration.

61
00:06:11,082 --> 00:06:14,051
It's been illegal since
the turn of the century.

62
00:06:14,219 --> 00:06:15,550
Even better.

63
00:06:17,622 --> 00:06:20,921
To the systematic derangement
of our senses.

64
00:06:21,126 --> 00:06:23,026
Forget the senses.

65
00:06:23,228 --> 00:06:24,957
Let's derange the world.

66
00:06:25,730 --> 00:06:27,755
We will.

67
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:30,061
When?

68
00:06:32,070 --> 00:06:34,061
Soon.

69
00:06:39,811 --> 00:06:42,109
What about tonight?

70
00:06:43,315 --> 00:06:47,547
-What about right now?
-I have a biology--

71
00:06:47,752 --> 00:06:49,583
Fuck your biology!

72
00:06:50,989 --> 00:06:53,423
You always have excuses.

73
00:06:55,493 --> 00:06:57,518
Let's forget it.

74
00:06:57,996 --> 00:07:00,931
We've been planning this for months.

75
00:07:01,166 --> 00:07:04,658
I'm sick of planning.
That's all it is with you.

76
00:07:04,869 --> 00:07:08,669
It's talk and plans and dreams.
You're a jerk-off.

77
00:07:09,341 --> 00:07:10,603
So jerk off.

78
00:07:12,210 --> 00:07:13,507
Richard, wait.

79
00:07:19,818 --> 00:07:21,843
Just be patient.

80
00:07:40,138 --> 00:07:41,969
Here comes The Hyena.

81
00:07:43,875 --> 00:07:46,844
Why can't I go inside the perimeter?

82
00:07:47,045 --> 00:07:49,673
I told them not to let anybody in.

83
00:07:49,881 --> 00:07:54,341
It's your first homicide. I didn't
want you stepping on your tongue.

84
00:07:59,057 --> 00:08:00,490
Take this.

85
00:08:00,692 --> 00:08:03,627
-What is it?
-lmportant tool. Hey, boys!

86
00:08:03,828 --> 00:08:07,059
Snack time! Set up a staging area.

87
00:08:07,265 --> 00:08:09,927
This place will be crawling
with people...

88
00:08:10,135 --> 00:08:11,898
...including our chief.

89
00:08:12,103 --> 00:08:14,230
-Rod?
-Yeah, Rod is not a cop.

90
00:08:15,573 --> 00:08:19,339
Darnell, get out of my crime scene!
Come on!

91
00:08:21,312 --> 00:08:22,711
Sorry, Cassie.

92
00:08:22,914 --> 00:08:25,382
There's only one way
into a crime scene.

93
00:08:25,583 --> 00:08:29,246
Put your foot where mine goes
and nowhere else.

94
00:08:29,521 --> 00:08:30,954
Ready?

95
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:44,725
Ever do this in vice?

96
00:08:44,936 --> 00:08:46,233
No.

97
00:08:46,938 --> 00:08:48,269
Right there.

98
00:08:49,441 --> 00:08:51,773
Looks like some kind of boot.

99
00:09:22,140 --> 00:09:24,108
What's that smell like?

100
00:09:24,809 --> 00:09:26,436
Smells like vomit.

101
00:09:26,644 --> 00:09:29,636
That's what I thought.
Bag some for the lab.

102
00:10:12,690 --> 00:10:15,591
-What's the matter?
-Nothing.

103
00:10:26,504 --> 00:10:29,530
-Notice the hemorrhaging?
-She was strangled.

104
00:10:29,741 --> 00:10:32,676
Finger-shaped marks around the neck.

105
00:10:33,545 --> 00:10:35,137
Look at this.

106
00:10:36,047 --> 00:10:37,446
Clean cut.

107
00:10:37,649 --> 00:10:39,640
-Trophy?
-That'd be my guess.

108
00:10:40,385 --> 00:10:41,977
Defensive wounds.

109
00:10:42,220 --> 00:10:44,051
She put up a fight.

110
00:10:44,556 --> 00:10:46,080
Good for you.

111
00:10:46,724 --> 00:10:49,192
This is a secondary crime scene. Why?

112
00:10:49,394 --> 00:10:54,229
This wound would produce lots
of blood. There's very little here.

113
00:10:54,432 --> 00:10:56,059
What about these?

114
00:10:56,267 --> 00:10:58,462
-Piquerism.
-Pre or postmortem?

115
00:10:58,670 --> 00:11:00,501
Post, no blood.

116
00:11:00,705 --> 00:11:02,036
Not bad, vice.

117
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:04,902
Probably aced your detective's exam.

118
00:11:05,677 --> 00:11:08,805
The wind is picking up,
we'll lose evidence.

119
00:11:09,013 --> 00:11:10,913
Hold on to everything we find.

120
00:11:11,516 --> 00:11:15,475
-Any idea who she is?
-No. No car, no I.D.

121
00:11:15,687 --> 00:11:17,086
Jane Doe.

122
00:11:48,219 --> 00:11:49,743
Hey, Bonaparte.

123
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:58,126
What's the matter?

124
00:11:59,964 --> 00:12:02,091
Miss Mills?

125
00:12:04,569 --> 00:12:06,969
Time's up. Put your pens down.

126
00:12:07,171 --> 00:12:09,799
Exchange your test with a neighbor.

127
00:12:12,543 --> 00:12:15,137
Number 20 is C...

128
00:12:15,346 --> 00:12:17,143
..."Burnt Norton."

129
00:12:18,082 --> 00:12:20,141
I suppose you find it funny.

130
00:12:21,252 --> 00:12:22,549
What?

131
00:12:23,488 --> 00:12:25,979
Me flunking a pop quiz.

132
00:12:27,158 --> 00:12:30,787
You didn't flunk. You got 19 out of 20.

133
00:12:33,331 --> 00:12:35,595
Please pass the tests forward.

134
00:12:40,672 --> 00:12:42,799
Wait up, I want to talk to you.

135
00:12:43,007 --> 00:12:45,805
-Why did you do that?
-I have motives.

136
00:12:46,010 --> 00:12:47,341
Like what?

137
00:12:48,046 --> 00:12:51,015
I need your help
for my physics midterm.

138
00:12:53,051 --> 00:12:54,518
Why me?

139
00:12:54,719 --> 00:12:56,880
Because you're a genius, okay?

140
00:12:58,856 --> 00:13:00,824
I live at 1108 Chandler.

141
00:13:01,025 --> 00:13:04,017
Can you remember that?
Around 5?

142
00:13:08,866 --> 00:13:10,197
Hi, Lisa.

143
00:13:11,736 --> 00:13:13,795
-This friend--
-Turn right.

144
00:13:16,307 --> 00:13:19,333
-lt's right here.
-A houseboat. Neat.

145
00:13:19,544 --> 00:13:21,011
Neat indeed.

146
00:13:21,212 --> 00:13:24,238
I like it out here.
Not too many people.

147
00:13:25,383 --> 00:13:27,681
Thanks. See you tomorrow.

148
00:13:31,723 --> 00:13:34,487
-You gonna see me to the door?
-Of course.

149
00:13:35,159 --> 00:13:37,354
You made detective in four years?

150
00:13:37,562 --> 00:13:40,793
-Must be smarter than you look.
-Thank you.

151
00:13:40,998 --> 00:13:43,398
It'll only get worse, I warn you.

152
00:13:44,402 --> 00:13:47,894
-You been talking to the boys?
-I heard a few things.

153
00:13:48,106 --> 00:13:51,234
They tell you why
I was called The Hyena?

154
00:13:51,676 --> 00:13:55,112
-Why?
-Female hyenas have a mock penis.

155
00:13:55,413 --> 00:13:59,144
-Draw your own conclusions.
-Does that bother you?

156
00:13:59,350 --> 00:14:02,911
I just wear loose slacks.
It's really not a problem.

157
00:14:07,592 --> 00:14:08,923
See you later.

158
00:15:03,147 --> 00:15:06,116
No prints.
The killer must have worn gloves.

159
00:15:06,317 --> 00:15:09,115
-So it's not a husband or boyfriend.
-Why?

160
00:15:09,387 --> 00:15:11,981
You don't use gloves
to kill your wife.

161
00:15:12,190 --> 00:15:14,624
Unless you've thought about it.

162
00:15:14,826 --> 00:15:18,284
Missing ring finger.
Ritual? Serial killer?

163
00:15:18,496 --> 00:15:21,761
-Maybe a comment on matrimony.
-A negative one.

164
00:15:21,966 --> 00:15:26,630
Maybe we should investigate
every bad marriage in the county.

165
00:15:26,838 --> 00:15:30,535
-Why don't you get on that?
-Let's start with you.

166
00:15:30,741 --> 00:15:32,641
-Ever been married?
-Nope.

167
00:15:34,779 --> 00:15:36,644
What's this?

168
00:15:38,015 --> 00:15:41,075
An old murder case I was involved in.

169
00:15:41,285 --> 00:15:44,652
The guy's up for parole,
they want me to testify.

170
00:15:44,856 --> 00:15:46,483
What do we have on Jane Doe?

171
00:15:46,691 --> 00:15:49,421
I'm checking missing persons
nationwide.

172
00:15:49,627 --> 00:15:52,960
Run her prints,
have an artist do a sketch.

173
00:15:58,569 --> 00:15:59,831
I got it.

174
00:16:00,037 --> 00:16:03,632
Bonaparte!
I didn't think you'd show. Come in.

175
00:16:08,546 --> 00:16:11,014
Who did these?
They're quite good.

176
00:16:11,215 --> 00:16:13,012
Thank you.

177
00:16:13,217 --> 00:16:16,050
-You did them?
-Don't look so surprised.

178
00:16:16,254 --> 00:16:17,949
I modeled for them too.

179
00:16:20,057 --> 00:16:22,150
Bonaparte, you're blushing.

180
00:16:22,894 --> 00:16:24,725
Why do you call me that?

181
00:16:25,730 --> 00:16:28,460
Ever take a career aptitude test?

182
00:16:28,766 --> 00:16:30,028
No.

183
00:16:30,234 --> 00:16:35,171
If you ever did, they'd recommend
you a career as a dictator.

184
00:16:36,841 --> 00:16:38,069
Why?

185
00:16:39,010 --> 00:16:40,978
Who would listen to me?

186
00:16:42,013 --> 00:16:43,913
Where's your physics book?

187
00:16:56,060 --> 00:17:00,360
You're overfeeding that thing.
It'll get as fat as you are.

188
00:17:01,432 --> 00:17:04,663
I hope this is better
than that other stuff.

189
00:17:04,835 --> 00:17:06,097
It's KGB.

190
00:17:07,038 --> 00:17:09,666
For $400,
it better put me on the moon.

191
00:17:09,874 --> 00:17:13,105
You'll be totally satisfied,
I guarantee it.

192
00:17:13,377 --> 00:17:14,708
Money back?

193
00:17:15,279 --> 00:17:17,611
Come on, can't we cut a deal?

194
00:17:18,082 --> 00:17:20,676
-You don't want it?
-I want it.

195
00:17:20,885 --> 00:17:22,284
Richie Rich.

196
00:17:22,620 --> 00:17:26,078
-I hate it when you call me that.
-lt's a deal.

197
00:17:26,290 --> 00:17:30,021
Bring me a couple
pigtailed cheerleaders...

198
00:17:30,227 --> 00:17:32,661
...then I give it to you free.

199
00:17:33,631 --> 00:17:37,226
-How can I trust that?
-I love this part.

200
00:17:40,404 --> 00:17:43,237
Can I just get the product already?

201
00:17:43,474 --> 00:17:45,135
Check this out.

202
00:17:46,644 --> 00:17:48,908
-Come on--
-You'll get it. Hang on.

203
00:17:52,750 --> 00:17:55,241
Listen to her. She loves it.

204
00:19:16,167 --> 00:19:17,634
We got our Jane Doe.

205
00:19:17,835 --> 00:19:21,794
Her name was Olivia Lake.
She missed three days of work.

206
00:19:22,006 --> 00:19:25,373
Her supervisor
found the place like this.

207
00:19:28,145 --> 00:19:31,171
What do we know about the supervisor?

208
00:19:31,382 --> 00:19:34,715
Married, two kids, solid alibi.

209
00:19:37,188 --> 00:19:41,784
Maybe she caught somebody in the
middle of a 459, and he panicked?

210
00:19:42,626 --> 00:19:44,958
And what, took the body with him?

211
00:19:47,932 --> 00:19:50,526
Where did these mud prints come from?

212
00:19:53,337 --> 00:19:55,669
There's a planting bed out here.

213
00:20:01,212 --> 00:20:02,873
Looks dry as a bone.

214
00:20:03,614 --> 00:20:05,673
Maybe she watered the lawn.

215
00:20:09,353 --> 00:20:11,753
We got a time of death?

216
00:20:11,956 --> 00:20:16,859
Based on stomach content,
between 9 and 10 Thursday night.

217
00:20:17,795 --> 00:20:19,695
How about 9:27?

218
00:20:28,139 --> 00:20:29,470
Can we come in?

219
00:20:29,707 --> 00:20:31,538
Let the games begin.

220
00:20:35,146 --> 00:20:37,706
Sam Kennedy, Al Swanson.

221
00:20:38,215 --> 00:20:41,878
New assistant D.A.
and former member of our department.

222
00:20:42,319 --> 00:20:46,016
Nice to meet you.
Miss Mayweather, always a pleasure.

223
00:20:46,223 --> 00:20:50,922
Heard you finally passed the bar.
Did they make it true or false?

224
00:20:51,162 --> 00:20:53,062
She hasn't lost her sting.

225
00:20:53,264 --> 00:20:56,097
-What are you doing here?
-Staying informed.

226
00:20:56,300 --> 00:20:59,394
Really?
Sam, please keep him informed.

227
00:21:06,010 --> 00:21:07,705
Thank you.

228
00:21:09,079 --> 00:21:10,740
What do we got here?

229
00:21:14,185 --> 00:21:15,709
Sorry.

230
00:21:38,075 --> 00:21:41,135
-Can I have you sign off?
-Okay.

231
00:21:58,796 --> 00:22:03,256
Sam, it's me. I'll be a little late.
Why don't you get started?

232
00:23:03,127 --> 00:23:05,118
Looks like a body dump.

233
00:23:17,207 --> 00:23:20,005
Jesus, she's alive!

234
00:23:36,660 --> 00:23:38,560
Nice detective work.

235
00:23:39,496 --> 00:23:41,157
How'd you find me?

236
00:23:41,565 --> 00:23:44,033
Rule one: Talk to the neighbors.

237
00:23:45,402 --> 00:23:49,168
You said a little late,
and it's been three hours.

238
00:24:02,019 --> 00:24:04,920
This about that D.A., Swanson?

239
00:24:05,122 --> 00:24:06,851
That asshole? No.

240
00:24:07,691 --> 00:24:11,024
-He seemed okay.
-Yeah, well, try dating him.

241
00:24:11,929 --> 00:24:15,421
He got rough with me,
so I broke his nose with a cat.

242
00:24:15,632 --> 00:24:17,293
A cat?

243
00:24:17,501 --> 00:24:19,128
Well, a ceramic cat.

244
00:24:27,778 --> 00:24:29,109
No, thanks.

245
00:24:31,215 --> 00:24:34,207
-Good. Then you can walk me home.
-Sure.

246
00:24:47,698 --> 00:24:48,960
Thank you.

247
00:24:49,733 --> 00:24:51,098
Sit down.

248
00:25:05,482 --> 00:25:06,881
I should get going.

249
00:25:07,084 --> 00:25:08,779
What's the rush?

250
00:25:17,995 --> 00:25:21,294
Can I ask you a personal question?

251
00:25:21,665 --> 00:25:23,326
I can hardly wait.

252
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:27,161
How did you get into this work?
Why homicide?

253
00:25:29,339 --> 00:25:32,274
Someone I knew was murdered,
and I got interested.

254
00:25:32,476 --> 00:25:34,467
-Really?
-No.

255
00:25:35,946 --> 00:25:37,777
I'm just bullshitting you.

256
00:25:38,182 --> 00:25:41,379
It's just the kind of crap
people like to hear.

257
00:25:50,461 --> 00:25:52,361
Wait.

258
00:25:52,529 --> 00:25:53,962
What are you doing?

259
00:25:54,164 --> 00:25:58,123
It's called sex.
It's fun, you should try it.

260
00:26:04,074 --> 00:26:07,168
We gotta work together.
This is a bad idea.

261
00:26:07,377 --> 00:26:10,210
Don't worry, I won't get possessive.

262
00:26:12,316 --> 00:26:13,544
Wait.

263
00:26:13,884 --> 00:26:17,217
-Why are you doing this?
-Because I want to.

264
00:26:18,489 --> 00:26:20,286
What about what I want?

265
00:26:20,491 --> 00:26:21,981
What do you want?

266
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:25,152
-Right now?
-Yeah.

267
00:26:26,763 --> 00:26:28,458
This.

268
00:26:48,685 --> 00:26:50,346
Wait. Slow down.

269
00:27:00,264 --> 00:27:03,290
No, no, leave that on.
Just that. Please.

270
00:27:04,434 --> 00:27:05,696
Sure.

271
00:27:32,963 --> 00:27:34,430
What's the matter?

272
00:27:34,631 --> 00:27:37,464
-You gotta get up, you gotta go.
-Why?

273
00:27:38,435 --> 00:27:41,165
Because I gotta get some sleep.

274
00:27:41,371 --> 00:27:44,272
-Can we sleep together?
-Bed's too small.

275
00:27:44,474 --> 00:27:48,308
-No, it's not.
-Come on, you gotta go.

276
00:27:51,248 --> 00:27:52,647
Jesus!

277
00:28:03,393 --> 00:28:06,021
I'll see you tomorrow. Good night.

278
00:28:30,754 --> 00:28:34,155
The evidence is so tiny,
you wouldn't recognize it.

279
00:28:34,358 --> 00:28:38,226
A few red and yellow carpet fibers,
some hair.

280
00:28:38,428 --> 00:28:40,020
That's it.

281
00:28:40,264 --> 00:28:45,167
The fibers will be tested to find
generic and subgeneric classes...

282
00:28:45,369 --> 00:28:49,669
...then compared to a database
for the manufacturer.

283
00:28:49,873 --> 00:28:54,742
Fibers consistent with a mass-produced
variety, made in Denver.

284
00:28:54,945 --> 00:28:59,006
Distributed in the United States
under several names.

285
00:28:59,383 --> 00:29:02,181
-No help.
-Same with the red fibers.

286
00:29:02,386 --> 00:29:05,219
Several trilobal nylon fibers...

287
00:29:05,422 --> 00:29:09,950
...along with other fibers
will be matched with a brand.

288
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:14,290
It's sold by Hanover Sampson
for several discount stores.

289
00:29:15,465 --> 00:29:17,194
That narrows it down.

290
00:29:17,401 --> 00:29:20,598
They sold 50,000 in that color last year.

291
00:29:20,804 --> 00:29:24,865
Examination of the cuticle,
cortex and medulla of the hair...

292
00:29:25,075 --> 00:29:27,441
...will reveal them to be human.

293
00:29:27,644 --> 00:29:31,136
Two brown human hairs.
Definitely not the victim's.

294
00:29:31,648 --> 00:29:33,240
All but one.

295
00:29:39,690 --> 00:29:42,420
At first, it will baffle them.

296
00:29:42,626 --> 00:29:47,928
One hair of nonhuman origin, scale
matches Cynocephalus maimon.

297
00:29:49,232 --> 00:29:51,291
It's a freaking baboon hair.

298
00:29:51,501 --> 00:29:56,996
No fingerprints, no murder weapon.
They have their work cut out for them.

299
00:29:58,575 --> 00:30:00,475
That's what they're paid for.

300
00:30:00,677 --> 00:30:06,616
Coroner said strangulation was slow.
Perhaps the victim was being tortured.

301
00:30:07,417 --> 00:30:10,750
The postmortem stab wounds
barely broke the surface.

302
00:30:20,130 --> 00:30:21,427
Okay, that's it.

303
00:30:21,631 --> 00:30:26,159
They'll decide that, given the sloppy
nature of the crime scene...

304
00:30:26,336 --> 00:30:28,167
...the postmortem mutilation...

305
00:30:28,338 --> 00:30:31,899
...the profile will be that
of a disorganized offender.

306
00:30:32,075 --> 00:30:33,838
Poor social skills.

307
00:30:34,044 --> 00:30:35,671
Nocturnal by nature.

308
00:30:35,846 --> 00:30:37,677
Probably into pornography.

309
00:30:37,881 --> 00:30:40,111
Intelligent, but uneducated.

310
00:30:40,317 --> 00:30:42,808
Lives alone,
few relations with women.

311
00:30:43,019 --> 00:30:46,182
Attack was spontaneous.

312
00:30:46,390 --> 00:30:48,449
Unplanned.

313
00:30:48,658 --> 00:30:54,187
He didn't drive down close
to the dump spot. That is planning.

314
00:30:55,098 --> 00:30:57,089
But he left the footprints.

315
00:30:57,267 --> 00:31:01,601
No evidence will lead to the suspect,
but they'll damn him.

316
00:31:02,105 --> 00:31:06,439
-When will they have a suspect?
-They're eating out of our hands.

317
00:31:06,610 --> 00:31:09,238
Poor Ray. He'll never see it coming.

318
00:31:09,413 --> 00:31:11,540
Cassie, look at this.

319
00:31:13,817 --> 00:31:17,685
Vigi boots.
What the hell are Vigi boots?

320
00:31:19,456 --> 00:31:21,720
There he is, in the black coat.

321
00:31:22,058 --> 00:31:24,526
Don't let him charm you too much.

322
00:31:24,861 --> 00:31:26,761
Richard Haywood?

323
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:33,736
Cassie Mayweather, Sam Kennedy,
police. Can we talk to you?

324
00:31:34,137 --> 00:31:36,298
Yeah, sure.

325
00:31:39,576 --> 00:31:42,704
You're willing to speak
without an attorney?

326
00:31:42,913 --> 00:31:44,471
Sure.

327
00:31:45,449 --> 00:31:48,646
Where were you last Thursday night?

328
00:31:51,655 --> 00:31:54,749
-What is this about?
-Answer the question.

329
00:31:54,958 --> 00:31:59,861
I was cramming for this calculus
midterm. I was with a study group.

330
00:32:00,030 --> 00:32:04,592
-How long?
-From about 7 until 3 Friday morning.

331
00:32:04,768 --> 00:32:08,670
-That's quite a cram session.
-Yeah, well....

332
00:32:09,105 --> 00:32:14,543
I got kind of a spotty record, and I
gotta keep my grades up for college.

333
00:32:19,716 --> 00:32:22,810
Can you give us the names
of the other people there?

334
00:32:23,353 --> 00:32:26,049
Sure. Am I in some kind of trouble?

335
00:32:26,857 --> 00:32:30,224
You seem very particular
about your appearance.

336
00:32:31,361 --> 00:32:32,885
Thanks.

337
00:32:33,463 --> 00:32:36,023
I like your outfit too.

338
00:32:36,466 --> 00:32:38,957
She looks good.
It's, like, feminine...

339
00:32:39,135 --> 00:32:42,366
...but it still manages
to be professional.

340
00:32:42,572 --> 00:32:44,597
Is that like a pleather?

341
00:32:45,542 --> 00:32:47,100
Kmart.

342
00:32:47,310 --> 00:32:49,437
We're interested in your shoes.

343
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:51,973
Let's talk about these.

344
00:32:52,349 --> 00:32:55,910
-Vigis?
-You own a pair of these?

345
00:32:57,754 --> 00:33:02,953
You bought them at Scarlatti's,
downtown Santa Barbara, for $637.50...

346
00:33:03,159 --> 00:33:05,992
...on your platinum bankcard.

347
00:33:06,396 --> 00:33:08,660
Size 12D.

348
00:33:11,167 --> 00:33:13,533
This can't be about my shoes.

349
00:33:13,737 --> 00:33:15,329
Why not?

350
00:33:16,773 --> 00:33:19,264
This is about my shoes?

351
00:33:23,513 --> 00:33:26,710
You got me freaked out
like I did something.

352
00:33:26,917 --> 00:33:29,351
Did you find them or what?

353
00:33:30,387 --> 00:33:33,720
I reported them stolen
three weeks ago.

354
00:33:34,257 --> 00:33:37,420
I even filed a report
with the front office.

355
00:33:38,962 --> 00:33:41,453
Did you find the shoes or not?

356
00:33:44,234 --> 00:33:47,260
I think you should tell me
what's going on.

357
00:33:47,437 --> 00:33:50,338
Because I'm spinning out here.

358
00:33:50,540 --> 00:33:55,136
Shoe prints matching these were found
at a murder scene last week.

359
00:33:55,378 --> 00:33:57,869
-The Covington woman?
-That's right.

360
00:33:58,281 --> 00:34:02,411
You think the person who stole
my shoes committed this murder?

361
00:34:03,253 --> 00:34:05,881
I'll cooperate in any way I can.

362
00:34:06,056 --> 00:34:08,217
Any idea who stole your boots?

363
00:34:08,391 --> 00:34:11,417
No, I don't. I wish I did now, though.

364
00:34:11,628 --> 00:34:15,223
-Any enemies at school?
-Well, it's high school.

365
00:34:15,632 --> 00:34:17,156
What does that mean?

366
00:34:17,334 --> 00:34:21,236
Not to sound arrogant,
but there are people who envy me.

367
00:34:21,404 --> 00:34:23,133
-Really?
-Yeah.

368
00:34:23,306 --> 00:34:25,137
Why would they do that?

369
00:34:26,309 --> 00:34:29,608
Well, let's just say
that I'm very fortunate...

370
00:34:29,813 --> 00:34:33,146
...and that I've been blessed
in many ways.

371
00:34:33,984 --> 00:34:37,920
-Must be nice being you, Richard.
-I got no complaints.

372
00:34:39,923 --> 00:34:43,620
It all checked out.
He filed a report about the boots.

373
00:34:43,827 --> 00:34:46,591
And made a big fuss to the principal.

374
00:34:46,763 --> 00:34:49,698
Yeah, I bet he was a pain in the ass.

375
00:34:50,900 --> 00:34:55,496
-She didn't say that.
-No, believe me. I hate kids like that.

376
00:34:55,672 --> 00:34:57,970
Like what?

377
00:35:01,478 --> 00:35:04,276
What about the study session?

378
00:35:04,981 --> 00:35:10,681
Six kids were at his house with him
from 7 or 7:30 Thursday evening...

379
00:35:10,887 --> 00:35:14,050
...till 3 a.m. Friday.
I talked to all of them.

380
00:35:14,257 --> 00:35:16,987
He was there except for 15 minutes...

381
00:35:17,193 --> 00:35:20,094
...he went to an ATM
to get cash for a pizza.

382
00:35:20,296 --> 00:35:25,893
-Did you check that out?
-Yeah, he withdrew $40 at 9:19.

383
00:35:29,706 --> 00:35:31,264
Get that enhanced.

384
00:35:31,474 --> 00:35:34,568
-Why?
-Because I can't see his face.

385
00:35:34,778 --> 00:35:36,211
It's him.

386
00:35:36,980 --> 00:35:39,676
I can't see his face.

387
00:35:41,551 --> 00:35:44,714
-You really think he's involved?
-I don't know.

388
00:35:45,889 --> 00:35:48,687
But something's not right
with that kid.

389
00:35:49,092 --> 00:35:52,459
Fifteen minutes.
It doesn't give him enough time.

390
00:35:52,662 --> 00:35:57,065
He has to drive to Covington,
kill her, dump her body, get back.

391
00:35:57,267 --> 00:35:59,861
He'd need at least an hour.

392
00:36:30,867 --> 00:36:33,097
-They questioned me.
-And?

393
00:36:33,269 --> 00:36:36,102
-lt was so cool!
-Did they go for the shoes?

394
00:36:36,272 --> 00:36:40,231
They grabbed it. I was so good.
I really was. Listen.

395
00:36:40,410 --> 00:36:42,378
This can't be about my shoes.

396
00:36:42,545 --> 00:36:44,604
-Why not?
-Did you find them?

397
00:36:45,081 --> 00:36:49,313
You sure they didn't suspect anything?
You didn't overdo it?

398
00:36:50,053 --> 00:36:54,456
A little bit.
I overdid it a little bit.

399
00:36:55,058 --> 00:36:59,188
You think the person who stole
my shoes committed this murder?

400
00:37:00,163 --> 00:37:04,065
I want you to know
I'm gonna cooperate in any way I can.

401
00:37:05,635 --> 00:37:07,899
Meet me at the bluff tonight.

402
00:37:08,104 --> 00:37:09,833
I can't.

403
00:37:13,143 --> 00:37:17,136
-Why not?
-I have something to do.

404
00:37:17,347 --> 00:37:22,785
-Like what?
-I'll tell you later. I should....

405
00:37:29,292 --> 00:37:32,455
-Know who his father is?
-I wanna search his house.

406
00:37:32,662 --> 00:37:35,529
Lawrence Haywood. He built the mall.

407
00:37:35,698 --> 00:37:38,496
-Big campaign contributor?
-That's right.

408
00:37:38,668 --> 00:37:41,762
And I won't fuck
with that guy on this.

409
00:37:41,938 --> 00:37:47,240
I've grown much too fond of my own ass
to do anything that goddamned stupid!

410
00:37:48,611 --> 00:37:51,136
And what is your problem?

411
00:37:51,848 --> 00:37:54,316
Where are you on this, Sam?

412
00:37:55,952 --> 00:37:59,353
-I don't care who his father is.
-I don't mean that.

413
00:37:59,522 --> 00:38:02,548
Do you think we have enough
to go after him?

414
00:38:05,795 --> 00:38:09,959
No. And if we go in too soon,
we could burn the whole case.

415
00:38:10,133 --> 00:38:12,260
Really? And why is that, vice?

416
00:38:12,468 --> 00:38:16,097
No judge would sign a warrant
based on what you have.

417
00:38:16,306 --> 00:38:17,864
Shut up, Swanson!

418
00:38:18,141 --> 00:38:21,577
-This kid with his attitude--
-Attitude isn't a crime.

419
00:38:21,744 --> 00:38:25,111
-lt's an indicator--
-But he doesn't fit the profile.

420
00:38:25,315 --> 00:38:27,545
The profile doesn't fit!

421
00:38:27,717 --> 00:38:32,916
The killer was smart. He didn't drive
to the site, he used Richard's boots...

422
00:38:33,122 --> 00:38:36,922
-...but the attack was unplanned?
-But if we push too soon--

423
00:38:37,093 --> 00:38:39,527
-Whose case is this?
-Just calm down.

424
00:38:39,729 --> 00:38:43,893
No, I've been trying to find
Olivia's killer, busting my ass--

425
00:38:44,100 --> 00:38:45,795
-Who's Olivia?
-The victim.

426
00:38:46,002 --> 00:38:49,768
-ls this still my case?
-lt's a coordinated effort!

427
00:38:50,840 --> 00:38:54,298
You're getting way too involved
in this, Cassie.

428
00:38:56,579 --> 00:38:58,046
-Cassie!
-What?

429
00:38:58,248 --> 00:39:01,081
-You called her by her first name.
-What?

430
00:39:01,284 --> 00:39:04,811
You said, "I've been trying
to find Olivia's killer."

431
00:39:05,021 --> 00:39:06,648
No, I didn't.

432
00:39:08,558 --> 00:39:10,355
Did I?

433
00:39:10,827 --> 00:39:16,925
You're supposed to be identifying
with the killer, not the victim.

434
00:39:18,301 --> 00:39:20,565
Remember that?

435
00:39:24,941 --> 00:39:29,776
You don't have any witnesses
or fingerprints or powder burns....

436
00:39:29,979 --> 00:39:31,606
I almost forgot.

437
00:39:32,282 --> 00:39:37,151
Tobias always kept a gun,
right here. Loaded.

438
00:39:37,353 --> 00:39:39,378
Can I come in?

439
00:39:46,996 --> 00:39:50,830
Listen, I'm sorry
I didn't back you up in there.

440
00:39:51,034 --> 00:39:54,299
I'm a big girl.
You said what you thought, right?

441
00:39:54,470 --> 00:39:57,166
-Yes, but--
-Then you did the right thing.

442
00:39:58,975 --> 00:40:02,502
-We can't just bust in there--
-I know. I heard you.

443
00:40:02,679 --> 00:40:06,581
-So can you get out of the way?
-Know what your problem is?

444
00:40:06,749 --> 00:40:10,480
Yeah, you're blocking Matlock.
Out of the way. Please.

445
00:40:10,653 --> 00:40:13,952
I'm trying to apologize here.

446
00:40:15,725 --> 00:40:18,990
All right, apology accepted.

447
00:40:20,163 --> 00:40:22,028
You want to sit down?

448
00:40:24,267 --> 00:40:26,462
You want to have a cookie?

449
00:40:47,223 --> 00:40:49,123
-Hi.
-Hi.

450
00:40:55,298 --> 00:40:59,428
-What's going on?
-We're making up.

451
00:41:00,003 --> 00:41:03,166
-We're still friends, right?
-What's this?

452
00:41:03,373 --> 00:41:05,466
I don't know, let's find out.

453
00:41:05,675 --> 00:41:10,612
-We do this and you throw me out again?
-Or you stay. Or you leave.

454
00:41:10,813 --> 00:41:13,839
I don't know.
It's hard to tell in advance.

455
00:41:14,384 --> 00:41:17,979
What do you want?
You want promises? You want a ring?

456
00:41:18,154 --> 00:41:21,612
-ls that what you want? A ring?
-Don't!

457
00:41:23,559 --> 00:41:28,826
Look, it's not just about sex, okay?
I really respect you as a person.

458
00:41:30,633 --> 00:41:32,726
Is that what you--?

459
00:41:33,970 --> 00:41:36,598
Why do you always want to hurt people?

460
00:41:36,806 --> 00:41:40,469
I wouldn't say always.
It kind of happens sometimes.

461
00:41:40,676 --> 00:41:44,635
You're so good at breaking
other people down...

462
00:41:44,847 --> 00:41:47,839
...but you never stop
and look at yourself.

463
00:42:42,638 --> 00:42:47,371
-Where are you taking me?
-No peeking, we're almost there.

464
00:42:47,543 --> 00:42:49,135
Step up.

465
00:42:52,982 --> 00:42:54,381
Okay.

466
00:42:54,584 --> 00:42:56,575
Open your eyes.

467
00:42:58,221 --> 00:43:01,987
My God, Justin, this is beautiful!

468
00:43:03,893 --> 00:43:06,361
Did you grow these?

469
00:43:14,137 --> 00:43:16,367
What happened? You're different.

470
00:43:17,006 --> 00:43:18,940
Yeah, I am different.

471
00:43:41,898 --> 00:43:43,593
Mayweather.

472
00:43:44,867 --> 00:43:48,598
Collect call from an inmate
in a corrections facility.

473
00:43:48,771 --> 00:43:51,706
-The name of the inmate is....
-Carl Hudson.

474
00:43:51,874 --> 00:43:54,672
If you wish to accept, press--

475
00:44:07,790 --> 00:44:11,021
-I do not wish to accept any calls--
-Cassie?

476
00:44:11,227 --> 00:44:13,559
-What?
-It's Sam.

477
00:44:14,397 --> 00:44:17,230
Hi, I'm sorry. What can I do for you?

478
00:44:17,400 --> 00:44:21,063
-Remember the puke at the body dump?
-Yeah.

479
00:44:21,270 --> 00:44:24,137
Most of it was unidentifiable...

480
00:44:24,307 --> 00:44:28,300
...but Kevin managed to isolate
some partially digested eggs.

481
00:44:28,477 --> 00:44:30,445
-Fish eggs.
-Caviar?

482
00:44:30,646 --> 00:44:36,585
Apparently so. I've compiled a list
of the local vendors selling caviar.

483
00:44:42,491 --> 00:44:45,324
-What was his name?
-Richard Haywood.

484
00:44:45,494 --> 00:44:48,952
Miles Haywood's kid?
He came in once around Christmas.

485
00:44:49,165 --> 00:44:50,792
Not last week? Thursday?

486
00:44:50,967 --> 00:44:53,765
I rarely see
any high-school kids here.

487
00:44:53,936 --> 00:44:56,029
-Except Justin Pendleton.
-Who?

488
00:44:56,239 --> 00:45:00,107
He used to come with his father,
but his parents split.

489
00:45:00,276 --> 00:45:03,643
Now he comes in alone.
He's a senior at Jefferson.

490
00:45:03,846 --> 00:45:07,543
Richard's a senior at Jefferson.
Justin eats alone?

491
00:45:07,750 --> 00:45:11,242
He always brings a book.
He's a bit of a loner.

492
00:45:11,454 --> 00:45:14,685
But a brilliant kid,
you should hear him talk.

493
00:45:15,124 --> 00:45:17,058
When was he in here last?

494
00:45:19,562 --> 00:45:21,553
The 5th. 7:30 p.m.

495
00:45:22,965 --> 00:45:25,593
-What time did he leave?
-About 9.

496
00:45:25,801 --> 00:45:28,031
Do you know what he ate?

497
00:45:33,776 --> 00:45:35,368
Justin?

498
00:45:35,578 --> 00:45:38,911
Cassie Mayweather,
with the San Benito Police.

499
00:45:40,116 --> 00:45:44,382
-You're a police officer?
-I'm a homicide investigator.

500
00:45:44,587 --> 00:45:48,853
-Can I ask you a couple questions?
-Sure.

501
00:45:49,258 --> 00:45:52,557
You had dinner
at Maison Saint Croix on the 5th?

502
00:45:52,762 --> 00:45:56,630
-Maison Saint Croix.
-Thank you.

503
00:45:56,832 --> 00:46:01,860
The 5th was a Thursday, and they had
a caviar appetizer. Did you have it?

504
00:46:03,372 --> 00:46:07,866
Yeah, I might have.
Can you tell me what happened?

505
00:46:08,077 --> 00:46:10,875
-Do you know Richard Haywood?
-Everyone knows him.

506
00:46:11,580 --> 00:46:13,241
Is he involved in this?

507
00:46:13,416 --> 00:46:16,010
-ls he a friend of yours?
-No.

508
00:46:16,218 --> 00:46:22,282
I mean, I tutored him for his bio
SATlast year, but we're not....

509
00:46:23,025 --> 00:46:25,516
We don't have much in common.

510
00:46:25,728 --> 00:46:29,755
-Are you in his study group?
-No. What study group?

511
00:46:29,965 --> 00:46:33,867
When you left the restaurant,
did you take leftovers?

512
00:46:34,537 --> 00:46:38,564
You didn't give your friends
at the study group leftovers?

513
00:46:38,774 --> 00:46:43,939
Look, I told you, I barely know him.
He makes fun of me in class.

514
00:46:44,146 --> 00:46:47,843
-Why would he do that?
-Because...

515
00:46:48,050 --> 00:46:51,076
...he's like that.
He makes fun of everyone.

516
00:46:51,287 --> 00:46:53,448
He's one of the cool kids.

517
00:46:53,622 --> 00:46:55,988
What makes him cool?

518
00:46:56,659 --> 00:47:00,527
You know, he's smart, he's rich...

519
00:47:00,730 --> 00:47:03,221
...he's witty, and everyone likes him.

520
00:47:03,399 --> 00:47:05,492
And you don't.

521
00:47:06,602 --> 00:47:11,630
Yeah, I knew kids like that.
Superstars of high school.

522
00:47:11,841 --> 00:47:15,834
Five years from now,
nobody will care who they are.

523
00:47:16,278 --> 00:47:18,974
Well, Richard will always be cool.

524
00:47:19,148 --> 00:47:23,517
His daddy's rich and I hate
to admit it, but he's actually smart.

525
00:47:23,719 --> 00:47:28,156
He's lazy and didn't study,
but he got a 710 on that bio SAT.

526
00:47:28,324 --> 00:47:31,919
-lt kind of spun me out.
-Spinning out, huh?

527
00:47:34,330 --> 00:47:36,457
You seem to know him well.

528
00:47:36,665 --> 00:47:39,327
You can tell by his behavior in class.

529
00:47:39,735 --> 00:47:41,293
Sorry.

530
00:47:44,607 --> 00:47:48,600
Cassie, where have you been?
Sam I.D.'d the suspect.

531
00:47:48,811 --> 00:47:53,145
-Who is it?
-Ask Sam. He's in charge of the case.

532
00:47:53,315 --> 00:47:56,944
S.I.D. is over there now
collecting evidence.

533
00:48:07,630 --> 00:48:08,858
-Hi, Cass.
-Hi.

534
00:48:09,031 --> 00:48:11,158
Look at this, sir.

535
00:48:11,667 --> 00:48:13,862
-Could be a match.
-Log that.

536
00:48:14,069 --> 00:48:19,837
I want samples of fabrics, soils,
any molds, plants in here and outside.

537
00:48:20,042 --> 00:48:22,806
John's found a stash
of marijuana buds.

538
00:48:22,978 --> 00:48:26,709
-You mind if we smoke up while we work?
-Yes, I do.

539
00:48:29,885 --> 00:48:33,321
-So who is he?
-Raymond Lee Feathers.

540
00:48:33,489 --> 00:48:35,650
He's a janitor at Jefferson.

541
00:48:35,825 --> 00:48:40,762
I compiled a list of everyone
who might have stolen Richard's boots.

542
00:48:40,930 --> 00:48:46,163
Then I cross-indexed that against
carpet purchases and up came this.

543
00:48:48,003 --> 00:48:51,495
Apparently he sold grass
to the kids at school.

544
00:48:53,175 --> 00:48:55,439
-Good work.
-Thank you.

545
00:48:55,644 --> 00:48:57,305
Where is he?

546
00:48:57,513 --> 00:49:00,778
I don't know. Seems like he took off.

547
00:49:02,184 --> 00:49:06,280
-Did you run him for priors?
-A couple DUls, one pot bust.

548
00:49:06,489 --> 00:49:11,449
But he hasn't shown up for work since
the day we talked to Richard there.

549
00:49:11,894 --> 00:49:13,555
Did you find the boots?

550
00:49:13,762 --> 00:49:17,892
Not yet, but we may have a match
on the yellow carpet fibers.

551
00:49:18,067 --> 00:49:22,026
We've nothing on the vehicle fibers
till we find his car...

552
00:49:22,238 --> 00:49:25,537
...but he's got a stash
of porno films, mostly bondage...

553
00:49:25,708 --> 00:49:28,404
...just like the profile.

554
00:49:28,644 --> 00:49:30,077
What?

555
00:49:35,150 --> 00:49:38,586
-He's not a neatness freak.
-What are you saying?

556
00:49:38,787 --> 00:49:43,815
Sloppy enough to leave footprints, but
smart enough to steal shoes in advance?

557
00:49:44,026 --> 00:49:47,985
-This is our guy, no question.
-You find any caviar jars?

558
00:49:48,330 --> 00:49:50,264
Come on, wait a minute.

559
00:49:50,599 --> 00:49:53,534
You're ticked that I got him,
aren't you?

560
00:49:53,736 --> 00:49:56,204
No. If you got him, I'm happy for you.

561
00:49:56,405 --> 00:50:01,240
After we close this case, maybe we
should look for different partners.

562
00:50:01,410 --> 00:50:03,435
Might be better.

563
00:50:03,746 --> 00:50:05,236
Whatever you want.

564
00:50:06,882 --> 00:50:08,349
Good.

565
00:50:10,085 --> 00:50:13,714
-Nice work, guys.
-I gotta take a piss.

566
00:50:13,923 --> 00:50:17,359
Don't worry,
I won't contaminate any evidence.

567
00:50:18,260 --> 00:50:20,888
-She pees standing up, that one.
-AI.

568
00:50:21,096 --> 00:50:23,758
Don't talk about her
like that, please.

569
00:50:23,933 --> 00:50:25,764
You've slept with her already?

570
00:50:25,935 --> 00:50:28,870
-What?
-You will. That's Cassie's m.o.

571
00:50:29,071 --> 00:50:31,972
She lets you get close,
then pushes you away.

572
00:50:32,141 --> 00:50:36,601
Ask her what's wrong, she picks
a fight. You're working with her...

573
00:50:36,812 --> 00:50:39,110
...because no one else will.

574
00:51:33,369 --> 00:51:36,031
Looks like a body dump.

575
00:51:57,359 --> 00:52:00,726
Now we know where
that baboon hair came from.

576
00:52:02,998 --> 00:52:04,465
It's okay.

577
00:52:26,388 --> 00:52:28,117
Hey, Lisa.

578
00:52:28,891 --> 00:52:31,826
-You want a ride?
-We already did that.

579
00:52:32,027 --> 00:52:36,225
That's not what I'm talking about.
I want to talk to you.

580
00:52:36,398 --> 00:52:40,061
-Want me to beg? Please.
-You'll get in an accident.

581
00:52:40,269 --> 00:52:42,931
Please. I don't care.

582
00:52:44,006 --> 00:52:47,567
You make me sad. Come on.

583
00:52:52,614 --> 00:52:55,139
Come on. It's fun in here.

584
00:53:21,810 --> 00:53:23,710
Hello, Justin.

585
00:53:23,979 --> 00:53:25,606
How you doing?

586
00:53:31,553 --> 00:53:33,214
What are you--?

587
00:53:33,655 --> 00:53:35,714
What are you doing here?

588
00:53:41,497 --> 00:53:46,025
-You stood me up for that slut?
-Lisa? She's not a slut.

589
00:53:46,235 --> 00:53:50,535
-Did you tell her anything about us?
-Of course not.

590
00:53:50,739 --> 00:53:52,798
-Of course not.
-You fuck her?

591
00:53:52,975 --> 00:53:57,435
-I was helping her with her physics.
-You fucked her, and I saw you.

592
00:54:00,516 --> 00:54:02,313
We kissed.

593
00:54:04,186 --> 00:54:08,088
-You kissed.
-That was it, I swear.

594
00:54:10,159 --> 00:54:12,252
Oh, Justin.

595
00:54:13,762 --> 00:54:17,163
You helped Lisa,
and you didn't even get laid?

596
00:54:19,768 --> 00:54:22,236
-What a schmuck.
-She's not like that.

597
00:54:23,105 --> 00:54:26,040
Bullshit. She spreads
like peanut butter.

598
00:54:37,553 --> 00:54:42,547
You'd be surprised what a girl without
a dad will do for male attention.

599
00:55:04,880 --> 00:55:06,438
Lisa.

600
00:55:32,641 --> 00:55:34,632
Do you hate me?

601
00:55:34,943 --> 00:55:36,706
I had to do it.

602
00:55:36,912 --> 00:55:43,215
I don't want to hurt you, but I had
to show you what she's really like.

603
00:55:45,988 --> 00:55:48,081
She's not good enough for you.

604
00:55:48,323 --> 00:55:53,522
She doesn't appreciate you. She's
like your mom, dad and everyone else.

605
00:55:54,263 --> 00:55:57,926
I'm the only person
who really cares about you.

606
00:55:58,367 --> 00:56:03,134
I think I'm the only person who sees
how incredible you really are.

607
00:56:03,672 --> 00:56:06,800
Don't go away, Justin. Come on.
What we did...

608
00:56:08,410 --> 00:56:10,105
...together...

609
00:56:10,979 --> 00:56:13,470
...how many people have done that?

610
00:56:14,850 --> 00:56:17,614
We proved something to each other.

611
00:56:18,654 --> 00:56:21,054
We showed what we're capable of.

612
00:56:22,724 --> 00:56:25,420
There's no limits for men like us.

613
00:56:32,034 --> 00:56:34,161
Did you hear about Ray?

614
00:56:36,438 --> 00:56:38,531
They're onto him.

615
00:56:40,842 --> 00:56:44,505
Just one last thing to do
and we're home free, right?

616
00:56:45,180 --> 00:56:47,375
Do we have to?

617
00:56:48,617 --> 00:56:50,448
You tell me.

618
00:56:51,486 --> 00:56:53,511
Do we have to?
