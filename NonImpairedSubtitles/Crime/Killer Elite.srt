though you hate to
admit it, are ex-SAS.

320
00:25:49,798 --> 00:25:52,383
JUSTICE: Remember,
we're businessmen
and bankers now.

321
00:25:52,468 --> 00:25:54,260
What we do here is illegal.

322
00:25:54,845 --> 00:25:57,555
We can leave no trace
of our activities.

323
00:25:57,640 --> 00:25:59,265
That's why we're called
The Feather Men,

324
00:26:00,434 --> 00:26:03,311
'cause our touch is light.

325
00:26:06,315 --> 00:26:07,941
THE DON:
Now, Spike's a good man.

326
00:26:08,025 --> 00:26:10,360
Day the SAS lost him,
they lost a good soldier.

327
00:26:10,736 --> 00:26:13,529
COMMANDER B: Yes, but
the problem is he thinks
he's still in the SAS.

328
00:26:13,614 --> 00:26:15,323
Well, someone has to do
the dirty work.

329
00:26:15,574 --> 00:26:17,450
None of us want blood
on our pinstripes.

330
00:26:17,534 --> 00:26:22,830
Listen, I've got
no problem with blood.
What worries me is ink.

331
00:26:23,707 --> 00:26:26,125
Make sure he keeps us
out of the newspapers.

332
00:26:26,210 --> 00:26:27,252
MARTIN:
What's doing, boss?

333
00:26:27,336 --> 00:26:28,753
Your Arabic's
still good, right?

334
00:26:28,837 --> 00:26:30,380
Good enough.
You're going to Oman.

335
00:26:30,464 --> 00:26:32,173
I've got a bloke I want you
to tail out there.

336
00:26:35,177 --> 00:26:36,803
You lucky bastard!

337
00:26:46,272 --> 00:26:47,772
(SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY)

338
00:26:48,399 --> 00:26:50,024
You know what?
You're gorgeous.

339
00:26:51,902 --> 00:26:53,111
Where are you staying?

340
00:26:53,195 --> 00:26:54,445
I'm staying
at the Hilton.

341
00:26:54,530 --> 00:26:57,657
As a matter of fact, so am I.
What room are you in?

342
00:26:58,158 --> 00:27:00,201
Why? Would you
like to know?
Love to.

343
00:27:00,995 --> 00:27:02,495
AIR HOSTESS:
You are smooth.

344
00:27:16,719 --> 00:27:18,803
DAVIES: What are we
doing out here, then,
in the middle of nowhere?

345
00:27:18,887 --> 00:27:20,471
MEIER: Well, I ask him
to go hide it, he hides it.

346
00:27:20,556 --> 00:27:22,598
Could've been your asshole,
consider yourself lucky.

347
00:27:23,017 --> 00:27:24,684
Shut it, Meier.

348
00:27:25,060 --> 00:27:26,728
Appreciate it, thank you.

349
00:27:33,152 --> 00:27:35,695
These tiles are
an exact match
to the shower step?

350
00:27:36,322 --> 00:27:37,322
Hundred percent.

351
00:27:37,698 --> 00:27:40,241
Harris comes home,
parks the car.
It's been a hard day.

352
00:27:40,326 --> 00:27:41,951
I'll have a shower.
Whoops.

353
00:27:42,036 --> 00:27:45,872
He slips on the shampoo,
hits the corner of the step
with his occiput.

354
00:27:46,248 --> 00:27:48,291
Case closed.
Get out of it.

355
00:27:48,709 --> 00:27:50,793
You boys are going
about this all wrong.

356
00:27:50,878 --> 00:27:52,420
That bird he's screwing
is married.

357
00:27:53,505 --> 00:27:56,007
Why don't we just pop 'em
both and make it look like
her husband did it.

358
00:27:56,091 --> 00:28:00,595
Pop 'em both?
What's she ever done?
It's Harris we're after.

359
00:28:02,097 --> 00:28:03,097
Poor bastard.

360
00:28:03,932 --> 00:28:06,726
Ten years after the war,
he cops it for doing something
he was ordered to do.

361
00:28:07,144 --> 00:28:08,686
He knew what he was doing
when he joined the club.

362
00:28:08,979 --> 00:28:10,938
Yeah, what club?
The killing club.

363
00:28:12,441 --> 00:28:14,150
It could be you or me.
Yeah, but it's not...

364
00:28:14,443 --> 00:28:16,277
I'm just glad
I never killed a raghead.

365
00:28:17,071 --> 00:28:18,196
No offense, my son.

366
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:19,447
Let's get this done.

367
00:28:20,032 --> 00:28:22,533
MEIER: Excuse my friend.
He's a royal asshole.

368
00:28:32,378 --> 00:28:33,419
Shit!

369
00:28:41,303 --> 00:28:44,138
DAVIES: Where's he gonna run?
It's the middle of
the fuckin' desert.

370
00:28:47,017 --> 00:28:48,142
Son of a...

371
00:28:56,235 --> 00:28:59,821
Meier,
cut him off at the next shaft!
Let's go, let's go.

372
00:29:05,702 --> 00:29:06,702
Where is he?

373
00:29:11,083 --> 00:29:12,125
Shh.

374
00:29:47,161 --> 00:29:48,202
(GRUNTING)

375
00:29:49,163 --> 00:29:51,247
DAVIES: Let's get out here.
Fuckin' hell!

376
00:29:57,671 --> 00:29:59,380
MEIER: So what, now
somebody's on our ass?

377
00:29:59,465 --> 00:30:00,673
DANNY: We should move
right away.

378
00:30:00,757 --> 00:30:02,592
We'll set up Harris'
interview for tomorrow.

379
00:30:02,885 --> 00:30:05,011
Davies, you make sure
his girl doesn't show.

380
00:30:05,095 --> 00:30:06,345
She has nothing
to do with this.

381
00:30:16,607 --> 00:30:18,191
(CLICKING)

382
00:30:24,490 --> 00:30:26,073
Wanker!

383
00:30:36,001 --> 00:30:38,711
DANNY: We're military
historians. I'll do
the talking, all right?

384
00:30:40,172 --> 00:30:42,131
Well, it's 5:00 somewhere,
isn't it?

385
00:30:42,841 --> 00:30:45,218
So where's this documentary
gonna be shown, then?

386
00:30:45,302 --> 00:30:46,302
On the telly?

387
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:52,600
The chair.

388
00:30:54,353 --> 00:30:56,812
Those bastards in C Company
put this together. Hmm?

389
00:30:57,481 --> 00:30:58,981
(LAUGHING)

390
00:31:24,466 --> 00:31:26,467
HARRIS: What's the matter?
They didn't like sand
in their burgers?

391
00:31:26,969 --> 00:31:28,010
Eh?

392
00:31:28,095 --> 00:31:31,305
Hello, boys.
I'm not saying a word
till I see my lawyer.

393
00:31:31,932 --> 00:31:34,267
Think back.
The village of Qum.

394
00:31:34,851 --> 00:31:36,936
You killed
a guerilla commander.

395
00:31:37,354 --> 00:31:40,773
His name was Hussain bin Amr.
Do you admit it?

396
00:31:46,321 --> 00:31:47,488
Fuck off!

397
00:31:48,031 --> 00:31:49,282
You're kidding, right?

398
00:31:49,366 --> 00:31:50,866
You commanded
a company there.

399
00:31:54,705 --> 00:31:55,997
Yeah, I led a company
on that op, sure.

400
00:31:56,331 --> 00:32:00,001
And you assassinated
Hussain bin Amr.
There were witnesses.

401
00:32:01,587 --> 00:32:03,504
You dropped him
in front of his family.

402
00:32:03,589 --> 00:32:04,880
(DISTANT SCREAMING)

403
00:32:08,302 --> 00:32:11,721
All right, you got me.
I did it. Hmm?

404
00:32:11,930 --> 00:32:14,890
Fuck you! Good one.
Now untie me.

405
00:32:15,726 --> 00:32:16,851
Get up.

406
00:32:17,728 --> 00:32:19,020
Hey! Piss off!

407
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:21,522
We have what we need.

408
00:32:21,732 --> 00:32:22,815
(PANTING)

409
00:32:23,358 --> 00:32:26,402
What if I told you
somebody else dropped
your guerilla commander?

410
00:32:28,030 --> 00:32:29,071
His name is...

411
00:32:30,115 --> 00:32:31,699
I can't remember.

412
00:32:32,534 --> 00:32:35,202
But he's writing a book
about the whole Oman gig.

413
00:32:35,287 --> 00:32:37,079
You might
find it in there.

414
00:32:37,789 --> 00:32:38,873
If you could read.
(LAUGHS)

415
00:32:39,916 --> 00:32:40,958
To the bathroom.

416
00:32:41,835 --> 00:32:44,420
No, no, no, no.
Wait, wait, wait.

417
00:32:44,504 --> 00:32:46,631
It's coming back to me,
looking at your fucking face.

418
00:32:46,757 --> 00:32:51,927
His name is
Captain R. Sole!
A-R-S-E H-O-L-E.

419
00:32:52,012 --> 00:32:54,055
Shut up.
You're fucking dead, yeah?

420
00:32:54,848 --> 00:32:55,931
On your knees.

421
00:32:57,559 --> 00:33:00,061
Fucking queers!
Serves you fucking right!

422
00:33:01,563 --> 00:33:03,814
Head down.
Get your fuckin'
hands off me, you queer!

423
00:33:04,191 --> 00:33:05,858
You're fuckin' kidding me.
DANNY: Hold him still.

424
00:33:05,942 --> 00:33:08,611
If I find you,
I'll put your fuckin' head
in the toilet bowl.

425
00:33:08,695 --> 00:33:09,737
Poor fucker.

426
00:33:09,821 --> 00:33:11,072
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

427
00:33:12,908 --> 00:33:14,075
(GRUNTING)

428
00:33:20,415 --> 00:33:21,415
Jay!

429
00:33:22,167 --> 00:33:26,253
I need money for the taxi.
I had to take a taxi.
I had a flat.

430
00:33:42,270 --> 00:33:43,396
HARRIS:
Fuck you! (SCREAMS)

431
00:33:53,281 --> 00:33:54,281
Case closed.

432
00:34:03,959 --> 00:34:05,000
Thank you.

433
00:34:10,966 --> 00:34:13,843
WOMAN OVER RADIO: Tells of
a dramatic 12-hour
rescue operation

434
00:34:13,927 --> 00:34:15,970
to save the crew
of Radio Caroline.

435
00:34:16,263 --> 00:34:18,055
The pirate radio
ship sank the...

436
00:34:21,309 --> 00:34:23,728
It seems your friend
did what you couldn't.

437
00:34:26,273 --> 00:34:27,648
Wouldn't.

438
00:34:27,733 --> 00:34:29,066
Wouldn't, couldn't.

439
00:34:29,776 --> 00:34:31,152
He's avenged Hussain.

440
00:34:31,236 --> 00:34:32,653
Good news for the old man,
not for you.

441
00:34:33,655 --> 00:34:34,655
What do you mean?

442
00:34:34,740 --> 00:34:36,991
Three brothers dead.
Rotting in the sand.

443
00:34:38,577 --> 00:34:40,327
You didn't wanna get
revenge yourself?

444
00:34:40,996 --> 00:34:42,705
Scared of getting
your hands dirty?

445
00:34:44,082 --> 00:34:45,583
Better get used to it.

446
00:34:46,209 --> 00:34:49,170
No palace where you're going.
A tent and a hole to shit in.

447
00:34:50,839 --> 00:34:52,715
He's your worst nightmare
and he's gonna do it.

448
00:34:55,260 --> 00:34:57,219
And when he does,
you're out of here.

449
00:34:58,180 --> 00:35:02,433
When I find you
in that desert,
I pray God keeps my aim...

450
00:35:06,271 --> 00:35:07,688
...true.

451
00:35:17,699 --> 00:35:19,033
(HAMMERING)

452
00:35:22,162 --> 00:35:23,287
Well, what do you think?

453
00:35:23,371 --> 00:35:24,413
Yeah, it's coming along.

454
00:35:29,711 --> 00:35:31,879
What are you doing
for New Year's Eve dinner?

455
00:35:32,839 --> 00:35:33,964
Oh, shit!

456
00:35:34,049 --> 00:35:35,090
(LAUGHS)

457
00:35:40,555 --> 00:35:41,680
DANNY: Bollocks!

458
00:35:44,935 --> 00:35:47,728
Strangers are a bit
of an exotic thing
around here.

459
00:35:47,813 --> 00:35:49,688
Oh, come on, I didn't
think I was a stranger.

460
00:35:49,773 --> 00:35:51,232
I know,
but you're still exotic.

461
00:35:52,275 --> 00:35:55,069
Danny, something tells me
you've got a story to tell.

462
00:35:56,363 --> 00:35:57,363
Yeah.
Mmm.

463
00:35:57,531 --> 00:35:58,906
(BOTH CHUCKLE)

00:35:59,241 --> 00:36:00,616
(GUNSHOTS)

465
00:36:09,209 --> 00:36:10,793
Come on,
what are you waiting for?

466
00:36:11,253 --> 00:36:12,253
Party's outside.

467
00:36:13,588 --> 00:36:15,297
MAN: Happy New Year!

468
00:36:16,132 --> 00:36:17,216
(PEOPLE CHEERING)

469
00:36:19,594 --> 00:36:21,053
Happy New Year!

470
00:36:22,597 --> 00:36:24,181
It's a tradition
around here.

471
00:36:25,183 --> 00:36:26,433
Happy New Year!

472
00:36:52,752 --> 00:36:54,169
Shit!

473
00:37:10,395 --> 00:37:12,396
Mirbat. The artist's
name is on the back.

474

Have them talk to him.

475
00:37:16,860 --> 00:37:18,152
One more thing.

476
00:37:18,236 --> 00:37:21,071
My boys had some
trouble in Oman.

477
00:37:21,156 --> 00:37:22,323
Somebody was
tailing them.

478
00:37:22,991 --> 00:37:24,575
We'll have to have
a look into that,
won't we?

479
00:37:26,286 --> 00:37:27,286
Yeah.

480
00:37:37,631 --> 00:37:40,341
Ah, that's how you
get it so lifelike, then.
Sorry?

481
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:43,677
Photos of the lads.
Isn't that like cheating?

482
00:37:43,887 --> 00:37:46,972
I'm recreating
an historical event.
Accuracy is everything.

483
00:37:47,057 --> 00:37:48,098
Mmm.

484
00:37:48,433 --> 00:37:50,893
That Mirbat painting
stopped me cold
when I saw it.

485
00:37:50,977 --> 00:37:51,977
You were at Mirbat?

486
00:37:52,062 --> 00:37:53,187
Had a mate there.

487
00:37:53,855 --> 00:37:55,981
I was hoping
you might have
an address for him.

488
00:37:56,066 --> 00:37:57,608
You're with the SAS?
Was.

489
00:37:59,277 --> 00:38:01,654
Then your best bet
for an address would be
Regimental Association...

They won't talk to me.

plying my trade overseas.

492

something somewhere.

I got a bullshitter
askin' about Mirbat.

499
00:38:37,065 --> 00:38:38,816
Yeah. He claims
he's with the regiment.

500
00:38:38,900 --> 00:38:40,567
No, there's no way
he was SAS.

501

the call was cut off,

there was somebody there
asking about Mirbat.

506

It has to be our guy.

507
00:39:15,937 --> 00:39:17,813
And what would you
have us do about it?

508
00:39:17,897 --> 00:39:19,148
Find him.

509

If we don't, there's gonna be
another murder and it will be
one of our Mirbat boys.

Well, they're pros
for sure.

512

If these guys are
going after the SAS,

513
00:39:27,115 --> 00:39:29,283
they're gonna be top-class
professional assassins.

514

They must have a string
of hits behind them

our people went too far.

519

It all needs
to be left alone.

He was the only officer
there that night.

who did the paintings.

Don't you worry
about that, all right?

532

He's shuffled off
this mortal coil.

533

That wasn't
part of the deal.

(LOUD MUSIC PLAYING)

632
00:51:24,874 --> 00:51:25,999
Hey! Hey!

633
00:51:29,587 --> 00:51:31,171
Show a bit of
respect, lads.

634
00:51:43,434 --> 00:51:44,601
Top that.

635
00:51:44,810 --> 00:51:46,978
I come bearing gifts.

636
00:51:49,523 --> 00:51:50,607
Oi!

637
00:51:52,359 --> 00:51:54,694
AGENT: From my boys
in Angola.

638
00:51:55,029 --> 00:51:56,112
(CHUCKLES)

639
00:51:56,572 --> 00:51:58,198
I have no idea
how you're meant
to eat this.

640
00:51:59,283 --> 00:52:01,201
So.
So.

641
00:52:02,411 --> 00:52:03,495
Who's on our ass?

642
00:52:03,579 --> 00:52:04,621
I'm on it.
Don't worry.

643
00:52:05,456 --> 00:52:07,415
Look, there's only
one more to go.

644
00:52:07,500 --> 00:52:10,293
After this is done,
I'll get you boys a nice,
cushy job in the sun.

645
00:52:10,419 --> 00:52:11,461
Hmm?

646
00:52:12,880 --> 00:52:13,963
There is no "after this."

647
00:52:18,552 --> 00:52:20,053
I'm a vulture.

648
00:52:20,221 --> 00:52:21,346
I live off killers.

649
00:52:21,889 --> 00:52:24,057
It gives me
a unique perspective.

650
00:52:24,141 --> 00:52:26,476
Have you heard of
the two percent?
That's you.

651
00:52:26,560 --> 00:52:28,353
Davies, the SAS,
all you lot.

652
00:52:28,604 --> 00:52:30,230
Mercenaries, hit men, heroes.

653
00:52:30,689 --> 00:52:33,608
You're all part of
that two percent of men
who are natural killers.

654
00:52:34,527 --> 00:52:36,152
That's why
you'll never get out.

655
00:52:36,946 --> 00:52:38,571
You can't run away
from who you are, Danny.

656
00:52:41,450 --> 00:52:43,284
That's not who I am,

657
00:52:43,369 --> 00:52:44,744
that's what I've done.

658
00:52:45,496 --> 00:52:47,288
And I can do
something else.

659
00:52:47,373 --> 00:52:48,748
Yeah, yeah.

660
00:52:49,041 --> 00:52:50,083
That's all nice and good.

661
00:52:50,167 --> 00:52:53,086
But let's just take care
of business first, shall we?

662
00:52:53,963 --> 00:52:56,256
Your third target,
Major Simon McCann,

663
00:52:57,508 --> 00:52:59,217
Mad Simon McCann of late.

664
00:52:59,385 --> 00:53:00,468
How'd you find him?

665
00:53:00,594 --> 00:53:02,387
Asked around.
It was easy.

666
00:53:03,389 --> 00:53:05,974
These days, he's your basic
"cash for trash" mercenary.

667
00:53:07,768 --> 00:53:09,102
He's a sitting duck.

668
00:53:10,729 --> 00:53:12,480
Now didn't I tell you
I came bearing gifts?

669
00:53:14,149 --> 00:53:15,608
You know
where to find me.

670
00:53:18,696 --> 00:53:20,154
DAVIES: You don't trust
that snake, do you?

671
00:53:20,447 --> 00:53:21,447
He's lying.

672
00:53:21,532 --> 00:53:22,782
Yeah? How do you know?

673
00:53:23,284 --> 00:53:24,534
His lips were moving.

674
00:53:24,618 --> 00:53:26,619
He just gave us
a third target.

675
00:53:26,704 --> 00:53:27,871
You've done nothing
on that last file.

676
00:53:28,330 --> 00:53:29,330
Someone's onto us.

677
00:53:29,623 --> 00:53:31,082
I want Hunter
out of there.

678
00:53:31,709 --> 00:53:32,709
I want this finished.

679
00:53:32,793 --> 00:53:34,502
And I want
to be around to enjoy
the money when it is.

680
00:53:34,795 --> 00:53:36,546
The first thing
you should buy
is a pair of balls.

681
00:53:38,382 --> 00:53:40,466
We're going after McCann,
all right?

682
00:53:47,057 --> 00:53:48,141
ANNE: I miss you.

683
00:53:49,393 --> 00:53:53,062
There's a lot
I don't know about you,
but I do know that much.

684
00:53:53,814 --> 00:53:55,481
I convince myself
that everything's okay

685
00:53:55,566 --> 00:53:58,067
because when I'm
with you I'm happy.

686
00:53:59,820 --> 00:54:02,322
But then you go away
and I realize that I
know nothing about you.

687
00:54:03,699 --> 00:54:06,534
I don't know where you go
and I don't know
what you do, I mean,

688
00:54:07,328 --> 00:54:08,661
you've got a whole
nother life, Danny.

689
00:54:11,498 --> 00:54:12,498
Is there someone else?

690
00:54:12,833 --> 00:54:13,791
Come on, Anne.

691
00:54:13,876 --> 00:54:14,876
Well, then,
what is it?

692
00:54:16,503 --> 00:54:19,339
I mean, Jesus,
what are you not telling me?
What are you hiding?

693
00:54:19,423 --> 00:54:21,507
Can we talk about this
when I get back?

694
00:54:22,176 --> 00:54:23,176
To hell with it.

695
00:54:27,890 --> 00:54:28,890
Fuck.

696
00:54:40,611 --> 00:54:41,611
What?

697
00:54:42,237 --> 00:54:43,863
You show me
a beautiful woman,

698
00:54:44,281 --> 00:54:46,908
I'll show you a bloke
that's sick of her shit.

699
00:54:46,992 --> 00:54:47,992
Shut up.

700
00:54:48,118 --> 00:54:49,118
Roger that.

701

(MEN LAUGHING)

702
00:54:52,623 --> 00:54:53,915
DANNY: That him?
DAVIES: That's him.

703
00:54:54,708 --> 00:54:56,209
Major Simon McCann.

704
00:54:56,669 --> 00:55:00,338
Served in the Sultan's forces
till he was pensioned out
four years ago.

705
00:55:01,173 --> 00:55:02,173
And another.

706
00:55:03,509 --> 00:55:04,509
Oi!

707
00:55:04,635 --> 00:55:05,760
What the fuck do you
think you're doing?

708
00:55:06,053 --> 00:55:07,845
Piss off, grandpa.
You want some?

709

(GRUNTS)

710
00:55:09,556 --> 00:55:10,598
Oh!

711
00:55:11,558 --> 00:55:13,226
DANNY: Doesn't look
like an invalid.

712
00:55:14,144 --> 00:55:18,439
Like I said, a bomb
went off under his jeep,
scrambled his wiring.

713
00:55:19,066 --> 00:55:20,233
He can't keep a job.

714
00:55:20,484 --> 00:55:21,901
He's a fucking psycho.

715

(GRUNTING)

716
00:55:24,822 --> 00:55:25,822
Jesus.

717
00:55:29,284 --> 00:55:30,952
Come on, mate,
that's enough.

718
00:55:31,912 --> 00:55:32,912
What's he doing here?

719
00:55:35,374 --> 00:55:37,333
That's the one
I went head-to-head
with at the hospital.

720
00:55:42,881 --> 00:55:43,840
Right.

721
00:55:43,924 --> 00:55:45,008
Wait, wait, wait.

722
00:55:51,432 --> 00:55:52,432
Let's go.

723
00:55:54,184 --> 00:55:55,268
Stick with him.

724
00:56:33,932 --> 00:56:35,808
Mac, it's me. You okay?

725
00:56:36,310 --> 00:56:39,395
McCANN: Oh, yeah,
still scraping skinheads
off my doorstep.

726
00:56:39,688 --> 00:56:40,688
All right, mate.

727
00:56:40,856 --> 00:56:42,648
I was just checking in.

728
00:56:50,532 --> 00:56:52,158
Bloke who drives
that green Jag,

729
00:56:52,659 --> 00:56:53,659
what's his name?

730
00:56:55,329 --> 00:56:56,996
AGENT:
His name's Spike Logan.

731
00:56:57,247 --> 00:56:58,915
He's an ex-soldier
of some kind.

732
00:56:59,917 --> 00:57:02,835
He got his eye shot out
playing a hero somewhere.

733
00:57:03,295 --> 00:57:06,172
He's got no job
and he keeps odd hours.

734
00:57:07,007 --> 00:57:08,049
Hmm.

735
00:57:09,134 --> 00:57:10,760
Don't you know
who these guys are?

736
00:57:11,220 --> 00:57:13,262
I mean, secrets being
your bread and butter.

737
00:57:13,347 --> 00:57:14,639
Don't worry about it.

738
00:57:14,723 --> 00:57:17,183
I do worry about it.
You should, too.

739
00:57:17,518 --> 00:57:20,186
Every move my guys make,
these lot are waiting.

740
00:57:20,562 --> 00:57:21,646
You ask me,

741
00:57:21,939 --> 00:57:25,066
I think it's time
you put those fancy shoes
of yours on a few throats.

742
00:57:25,776 --> 00:57:28,194
Yes. But no one
is asking you.

743
00:57:33,909 --> 00:57:36,494
DAVIES: You'll be interviewing
for a security position,
Mr. McCann.

744
00:57:36,662 --> 00:57:37,745
McCANN: Right.

745
00:57:37,830 --> 00:57:40,289
Actually we got your name
from a mutual friend
in the SAS.

746
00:57:40,457 --> 00:57:41,874
Yeah, really?

747
00:57:42,126 --> 00:57:44,460
So, we'll see you
Tuesday the 17th,
at 10:00.

748
00:57:44,545 --> 00:57:46,420
Okay.
We look forward to it.

749
00:57:46,505 --> 00:57:48,256
See you then.
All right, my son.

750
00:57:50,092 --> 00:57:51,217
He'll be there.

751
00:57:51,468 --> 00:57:53,553
Good.
I don't get it.

752
00:57:56,098 --> 00:57:57,098
McCann lives here.

753
00:57:57,891 --> 00:58:00,643
He'll be here
for the interview,
Tuesday at 10:00.

754
00:58:02,062 --> 00:58:03,062
He'll take this road.

755
00:58:03,897 --> 00:58:06,023
The Boston Brakes.
Perfect.

756
00:58:06,275 --> 00:58:07,567
They weren't perfect
in Boston.

757
00:58:07,651 --> 00:58:08,901
I wasn't at the controls.

758
00:58:08,986 --> 00:58:10,069
We've got 10 days.

759
00:58:10,362 --> 00:58:11,362
MEIER: Ten days?

760
00:58:11,572 --> 00:58:12,905
The quicker we get
this done, the better.

761
00:58:12,990 --> 00:58:14,740
I'm going to need
to bring in some help.

762
00:58:15,242 --> 00:58:16,659
Okay.
DAVIES: "Okay."
Just like that?

763
00:58:17,744 --> 00:58:19,078
McCann's being watched.

764
00:58:19,246 --> 00:58:20,913
How are you gonna
get a confession
out of him?

765
00:58:20,998 --> 00:58:21,998
We aren't.

766
00:58:22,374 --> 00:58:23,374
We'll fake it.

767
00:58:24,168 --> 00:58:25,293
Bit of bad lighting
and camera work,

768
00:58:25,919 --> 00:58:26,919
you could be him.

769
00:58:27,588 --> 00:58:30,464
What we'll do is
play back what he
admitted to in the reports.

770
00:58:47,608 --> 00:58:48,608
Who are you?

771
00:58:48,859 --> 00:58:51,944
I'm the one they let fly
around in an unmarked chopper
with a gun in my pocket.

772
00:58:52,446 --> 00:58:54,864
You can call me MFWIC.
"MFWIC"?

773
00:58:55,157 --> 00:58:57,116
Mother Fucker
What's In Charge.

774
00:58:58,368 --> 00:58:59,785
We have questions.

775
00:59:00,537 --> 00:59:03,998
About this little
illegal club of yours,
The Feather Men.

776
00:59:04,499 --> 00:59:05,791
Your attack dog,

777
00:59:06,043 --> 00:59:08,002
time to bring him
to heel, eh?

778
00:59:12,090 --> 00:59:13,466
And then we'll put that
on the agenda.

779
00:59:13,550 --> 00:59:14,634
Gentlemen.

780
00:59:15,093 --> 00:59:16,719
We'll be with you
in a minute.

781
00:59:23,435 --> 00:59:26,687
I want to put Locals
on Major McCann
around the clock.

782
00:59:26,772 --> 00:59:30,316
I realize McCann
is an old friend of yours,
but what has it to do with us?

783
00:59:34,029 --> 00:59:36,739
But this is our chance
to get the bastards
who killed Cregg and Harris.

784
00:59:36,990 --> 00:59:40,117
The authorities found
no evidence of foul play
in either case.

785
00:59:40,244 --> 00:59:41,494
What are you talking about,
"No evidence?"

786
00:59:41,578 --> 00:59:43,162
I've got the evidence
right here.

787
00:59:47,125 --> 00:59:50,670
Everybody in this room knows

THE DON: Well, we could
put it to the vote.

791
00:59:58,095 --> 01:00:00,179
Yes, but that would require
the full committee.

I puked for a day
afterwards.

just the way the army
likes them.

1108
01:23:22,915 --> 01:23:25,708
He describes an ambush
where he killed
a guerilla leader.

1109
01:23:26,919 --> 01:23:28,920
Harris did not
kill Hussain.

1110
01:23:33,008 --> 01:23:34,217
You gave me his name.

1111
01:23:35,344 --> 01:23:36,803
You said he was guilty.

1112
01:23:38,681 --> 01:23:40,098
Such is Allah's will.

1113
01:23:41,308 --> 01:23:42,642
Allah's will?

1114
01:23:43,102 --> 01:23:44,936
You had me kill
an innocent man.

1115
01:23:45,938 --> 01:23:49,107
The book will be
the real killer's
confession.

My father...

1117
01:23:52,778 --> 01:23:54,654
I know what
your father needs.

1118
01:24:07,459 --> 01:24:09,836
I need everything
you can get
on a Ranulph Fiennes.

1119
01:24:09,920 --> 01:24:11,671
Yeah, writer, ex-SAS.

1120
01:24:26,937 --> 01:24:27,937
What you got?

1121
01:24:28,605 --> 01:24:29,856
I got Fiennes.

1122
01:24:30,315 --> 01:24:32,316
He's still pushing
his book on Oman.

1123
01:24:32,860 --> 01:24:35,153
He'll be doing
a press bash on Tuesday.

1124
01:24:37,573 --> 01:24:39,532
Tuesday.
I know it's a bit
short notice,

1125
01:24:39,658 --> 01:24:41,492
but I'll be able to
put a crew together.
Nah.

1126
01:24:42,786 --> 01:24:43,786
I'll do this on my own.

1127
01:24:44,830 --> 01:24:45,830
Danny, are you sure?

1128
01:24:46,165 --> 01:24:47,165
It's just a phone call.

1129
01:24:49,251 --> 01:24:50,251
I guess he's sure.

1130
01:24:55,466 --> 01:24:58,509
B-I-N-G fucking O.

1131
01:24:59,803 --> 01:25:02,305
I knew I'd find you,
you bastard.

1132
01:25:19,656 --> 01:25:20,656
Do you mind
if I sit down?

1133
01:25:22,367 --> 01:25:24,494
You look lonely.
You're Danny's friend.

1134
01:25:26,121 --> 01:25:27,246
The famous Hunter.

1135
01:25:27,498 --> 01:25:28,498
He say nice things?

1136
01:25:29,082 --> 01:25:30,082
What are you doing here?

1137
01:25:31,502 --> 01:25:32,502
Watching you.

1138
01:25:33,045 --> 01:25:34,045
You should be with him.

1139
01:25:34,213 --> 01:25:36,422
I tried.
It didn't work.

1140
01:25:36,799 --> 01:25:38,049
He wanted me here
to protect you.

1141
01:25:38,717 --> 01:25:40,218
And you look like
you needed protecting.

1142
01:25:40,969 --> 01:25:42,094
From what?

1143
01:25:42,179 --> 01:25:43,221
You.

1144
01:25:45,224 --> 01:25:48,059
You're thinking about
him not coming back.
What happens then?

1145
01:25:50,020 --> 01:25:52,730
No, I...
I have a wife,
I know the look.

1146
01:25:53,857 --> 01:25:57,401
We've known each other
through thick and thin,
Danny and I.

1147
01:25:57,736 --> 01:26:00,404
Celine, my wife,
she loves him,
my kids love him.

1148
01:26:00,697 --> 01:26:02,740
I mean,

I know Danny's going
to come back for you.

1152
01:26:10,249 --> 01:26:12,291
And when he does,
you're going to
steal him away.

1153
01:26:12,376 --> 01:26:13,417
Huh?

1154
01:26:13,877 --> 01:26:15,419
I don't know
what the plan is.

Very good.

he'll run until you corner
him and then he fights.

the gloves are off.

He just took
the service stairs.
It has to be him.
