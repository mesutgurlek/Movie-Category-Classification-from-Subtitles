1
00:02:34,303 --> 00:02:35,703
- What do we want?!
- Justice!

2
00:02:35,837 --> 00:02:37,429
- When do we want it?
- Now!

3
00:02:37,572 --> 00:02:39,133
- What do we want?!
- Justice!

4
00:02:39,241 --> 00:02:40,833
- When do we want it?
- Now!

5
00:02:40,976 --> 00:02:42,256
- What do we want?!
- Justice!

6
00:02:42,311 --> 00:02:43,778
- When do we want it?
- Now!

7
00:02:55,157 --> 00:02:57,182
<i>- Your Honour, it's murder,</i>

8
00:02:57,326 --> 00:02:59,191
even when the police do it.

9
00:02:59,328 --> 00:03:03,196
Detective William James Taggart swore an oath
to protect and serve

10
00:03:03,332 --> 00:03:04,959
the people of New York.

11
00:03:05,834 --> 00:03:07,324
He shattered that oath.

12
00:03:08,036 --> 00:03:10,766
The state will prove
that there is probable cause

13
00:03:10,906 --> 00:03:13,704
to try him for the murder of Mikey Tavarez.

14
00:03:13,842 --> 00:03:15,400
Thank you, Your Honour.

15
00:03:15,544 --> 00:03:17,637
- Mr. Davies.
- Your Honour,

16
00:03:17,779 --> 00:03:20,373
it isn't murder
when the other guy is shooting at you.

17
00:03:20,515 --> 00:03:24,178
It isn't murder when the other guy has a gun.

18
00:03:27,856 --> 00:03:29,983
Five three, one-twenty.

19
00:03:42,204 --> 00:03:44,434
- What are we drinking, Chief?
- Nothing for me, sir.

20
00:03:44,573 --> 00:03:47,371
- Huh. Civilization going to pieces.

21
00:03:51,580 --> 00:03:52,945
Ah...

22
00:03:53,081 --> 00:03:57,074
Oh! You know, there are...
a lot of men in this town

23
00:03:57,219 --> 00:04:00,382
who would find it hard to trust
a man as respectable as you.

24
00:04:00,589 --> 00:04:02,454
I am not one of those men.

25
00:04:02,591 --> 00:04:06,254
Your boss, the police commissioner,
he's an asshole.

26
00:04:06,395 --> 00:04:08,829
- I came to discuss the Taggart case, sir.

27
00:04:09,398 --> 00:04:13,095
- What is there to discuss?
It won't even make it past preliminary.

28
00:04:13,235 --> 00:04:14,930
- Well, maybe we should hope it does, sir.

29
00:04:15,070 --> 00:04:18,335
Those 10,000 people on the courthouse steps
are gonna find it very hard to believe

30
00:04:18,473 --> 00:04:19,963
that this wasn't murder, plain and simple.

31
00:04:20,108 --> 00:04:21,871
- How's this for plain and simple?

32
00:04:22,010 --> 00:04:24,478
There's one less homicidal rapist
walking the streets.

33
00:04:24,613 --> 00:04:27,207
- Uh, Mikey Tavarez was found innocent
of those charges, sir.

34
00:04:27,349 --> 00:04:28,714
- He walked on a technicality.

35
00:04:28,850 --> 00:04:31,614
You and I both know
he raped and killed Yesenia Barea.

36
00:04:31,753 --> 00:04:33,584
- The law says differently, sir.

37
00:04:34,423 --> 00:04:36,414
- You always this much fun, Chief?

38
00:04:37,426 --> 00:04:39,291
I think Billy Taggart is a hero.

39
00:04:39,428 --> 00:04:42,261
And I like getting my photograph taken
next to heroes.

40
00:04:42,864 --> 00:04:45,958
I also like winning Staten Island
without actually having to go there.

41
00:04:46,101 --> 00:04:48,569
- A witness came forward this morning, sir.

42
00:04:49,438 --> 00:04:51,998
- We are two minutes away
from the judge's decision.

43
00:04:52,140 --> 00:04:54,267
- He came forward with evidence.

44
00:04:55,277 --> 00:04:56,403
- Where is it?

45
00:04:56,545 --> 00:04:58,809
- It's been temporarily misplaced.

46
00:04:58,947 --> 00:05:00,278
- The witness?

47
00:05:00,882 --> 00:05:02,076
- A kid.

48
00:05:06,288 --> 00:05:07,585
- Is he legal?

49
00:05:08,290 --> 00:05:10,656
Is his mother legal?

50
00:05:10,792 --> 00:05:12,419
We need to find out what he wants.

51
00:05:12,561 --> 00:05:14,825
- Appears he wants justice, sir.

52
00:05:14,963 --> 00:05:17,261
- Well, nobody gets that.

53
00:05:18,099 --> 00:05:19,566
What do you want, Chief?

54
00:05:21,670 --> 00:05:24,104
- I want what's best for the city, sir.

55
00:05:26,475 --> 00:05:28,705
<i>- It is the court's view...</i>

56
00:05:28,844 --> 00:05:31,335
that the state has failed...

57
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:33,209
...to present a clear case

58
00:05:33,348 --> 00:05:38,183
for why the shooting should amount to murder
and not self-defence.

59
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:43,553
Therefore the defendant will not be held
to answer to these charges at trial.

60
00:05:43,692 --> 00:05:46,183
He's free to go. Court adjourned.

61
00:05:52,133 --> 00:05:53,361
- Detective.

62
00:05:53,502 --> 00:05:56,494
Sorry to interrupt.
Chief Fairbanks want to see you.

63
00:06:00,342 --> 00:06:01,969
- Here's our guy.

64
00:06:02,511 --> 00:06:04,206
How are you?
- Mr. Mayor.

65
00:06:04,346 --> 00:06:05,779
- Billy.
- Hey, Chief.

66
00:06:05,914 --> 00:06:07,381
- Sit down, Detective.

67
00:06:07,716 --> 00:06:09,707
- What's this about?

68
00:06:09,851 --> 00:06:11,580
- Sit down.
- Don't worry about the Chief.

69
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:14,553
We draw straws for "good cop, bad cop"
and he won.

70
00:06:14,689 --> 00:06:16,657
- What, does he wanna interrogate me now?
- No.

71
00:06:16,791 --> 00:06:19,521
No, no.
I just wanted to get in a room with you.

72
00:06:20,529 --> 00:06:23,225
And I wanted to tell
you how proud I am of you.

73
00:06:23,365 --> 00:06:25,162
You've done the city a great favour.

74
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:27,894
You, in my eyes: hero.

75
00:06:28,036 --> 00:06:30,231
- Thank you.
- Here's the thing.

76
00:06:30,372 --> 00:06:32,602
Some uncomfortable evidence
has come to light.

77
00:06:32,741 --> 00:06:34,504
If it should come out...

78
00:06:35,176 --> 00:06:36,734
...we will be fucked.

79
00:06:36,878 --> 00:06:38,436
And it is a necessity

80
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:40,548
that we remain un-fucked.

81
00:06:41,383 --> 00:06:42,350
So...

82
00:06:42,484 --> 00:06:43,849
- You're done, Detective.

83
00:06:44,753 --> 00:06:47,085
- Yesenia Barea was 16 years old, Chief.

84
00:06:47,222 --> 00:06:49,417
- Mikey Tavarez was exonerated.
- Yeah, and they got it wrong.

85
00:06:49,558 --> 00:06:52,755
- So you put it right.
- No, I'm not the bad guy, Chief.

86
00:06:52,894 --> 00:06:54,452
Mr. Mayor...
- You keep telling yourself that.

87
00:06:54,596 --> 00:06:56,461
- You see, Billy,
there's some wars you fight,

88
00:06:56,598 --> 00:06:58,259
and some wars you walk away from.

89
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:01,369
- Mayor...
- This is not the fighting kind.

90
00:07:01,503 --> 00:07:03,198
I have a long memory, son.

91
00:07:04,105 --> 00:07:06,005
If you ever change your number...

92
00:07:06,775 --> 00:07:09,403
...you make sure you let my office know.

93
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:48,215
<i>Mayor Nicholas Hostetler
is Wall Street's approved candidate.</i>

94
00:07:48,350 --> 00:07:51,615
<i>At least that's the charge
coming from the Mayor's rival,</i>

95
00:07:51,753 --> 00:07:54,813
<i>Councilman Jack Valliant,
who spoke to reporters earlier today.</i>

96
00:09:01,456 --> 00:09:04,425
- Hey! What the fuck you doin'?!
- Hey, what...?! Ah!

97
00:09:07,896 --> 00:09:11,195
- Hey, what the fuck's going on out here?!
- I don't... Take it easy.

98
00:09:11,332 --> 00:09:13,664
- What's going on?
- This guy tried to attack me.

99
00:09:15,704 --> 00:09:17,137
Motherfucker!

100
00:09:19,407 --> 00:09:21,136
No, stop!

101
00:09:21,543 --> 00:09:23,101
No! Please! No.

102
00:09:23,244 --> 00:09:25,212
- Fucker.

103
00:09:25,346 --> 00:09:26,904
Where's my camera?

104
00:09:27,716 --> 00:09:30,276
Sweetheart, look at me for a second, please?

105
00:09:30,418 --> 00:09:31,851
Thank you.

106
00:09:33,722 --> 00:09:35,155
Sonofabitch.

107
00:09:39,561 --> 00:09:42,086
"Just like in the beginning,

108
00:09:42,230 --> 00:09:44,357
when no one would admit
something was happening."

109
00:09:44,933 --> 00:09:47,197
"Never... happened, never...

110
00:09:47,335 --> 00:09:48,734
happened."

111
00:09:49,370 --> 00:09:52,237
Big part, too disturbing...

112
00:09:52,373 --> 00:09:53,738
Something...

113
00:09:55,577 --> 00:09:57,738
<i>Ay dios, Billy. Otra vez?</i>

114
00:10:00,181 --> 00:10:01,614
- Alright, alright.

115
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:04,617
- When are you gonna stop doing this, Billy?
- Stop what?

116
00:10:04,753 --> 00:10:07,381
- Coming home
looking like a pack of bloody meat.

117
00:10:07,522 --> 00:10:09,956
- I thought you liked bloody meat.
- I'm a vegetarian.

118
00:10:10,091 --> 00:10:12,616
- Yeah, well,
you gotta get your protein somehow, right?

119
00:10:12,761 --> 00:10:14,490
- You're an asshole.

120
00:10:14,629 --> 00:10:15,891
- Ow.

121
00:10:16,030 --> 00:10:18,624
So did you pick up your dress
for the premiere?

122
00:10:18,767 --> 00:10:21,201
- Tomorrow.
- Am I gonna like this dress?

123
00:10:21,770 --> 00:10:23,465
- I think you'll approve.

124
00:10:23,605 --> 00:10:25,004
- Will Ryan like this dress?

125
00:10:25,140 --> 00:10:28,735
- I dunno. I'm not familiar with his tastes.
- Come on, I see the looks he gives you.

126
00:10:28,877 --> 00:10:31,197
- How come you see these looks
and I don't see these looks?

127
00:10:31,312 --> 00:10:33,832
- Because you only see the best in people.
It's your fatal flaw.

128
00:10:33,882 --> 00:10:34,974
- And what's yours?

129
00:10:35,784 --> 00:10:38,309
- Not being able to see the best in people.

130
00:10:38,453 --> 00:10:39,852
- Not even me?

131
00:10:39,988 --> 00:10:41,979
- You're the exception, you know that.

132
00:10:42,991 --> 00:10:44,652
- Well, I'm an actress.

133
00:10:44,793 --> 00:10:47,284
Maybe I've got you fooled.

134
00:10:47,428 --> 00:10:49,020
- I'm a detective.

135
00:10:49,164 --> 00:10:50,756

said he's gonna find you and kill you.

160
00:12:14,215 --> 00:12:16,581
- Call him back.
Tell him he owes me a camera.

161
00:12:16,718 --> 00:12:19,312
- Oh. Oh, he just stepped out?

162
00:12:20,521 --> 00:12:21,886
Oh, yeah, just now?

163
00:12:23,091 --> 00:12:27,653
Okay, well... you tell him he's got
till the close of business today

164
00:12:27,795 --> 00:12:30,320
to call Katy from Billy Taggart's office.

165
00:12:31,099 --> 00:12:34,000
Or else I'm gonna tell his wife
he's been screwing his assistant

166
00:12:34,135 --> 00:12:36,103
for the past 11 months, how about that?!

167
00:12:36,738 --> 00:12:40,196
- Are you serious?
- Look, these people provoke me, Billy.

168
00:12:40,341 --> 00:12:42,138
All day. You don't even know.

169
00:12:42,277 --> 00:12:45,769
- This is a professional workplace, Katy.
- Yeah. Once more with conviction.

170
00:12:45,914 --> 00:12:48,212
- How much have you cleared?
- Uh...

171
00:12:48,349 --> 00:12:50,613
like... $1,800?

172
00:12:50,752 --> 00:12:52,947
- Well, that's not bad.
How much is still outstanding?

173
00:12:53,087 --> 00:12:55,385
- Forty-two thousand.

174
00:12:56,557 --> 00:12:58,354
- Gimme the fuckin' numbers.
- Yeah.

175
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:01,558
- How about I fuckin' garnish your wages,
put a lien on your garage

176
00:13:01,696 --> 00:13:04,256
until I've gotten every cent
of the eight grand you owe me?

177
00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:06,959
Does that work for you?
<i>- How about I pay you in instalments?</i>

178
00:13:07,101 --> 00:13:10,101
- Yeah, three instalments of 2,650.
First payment this Friday. Talk to Katy.

179
00:13:10,138 --> 00:13:11,833
<i>Jimmy. Hey, buddy.</i>
It's Billy.

180
00:13:11,973 --> 00:13:14,806
<i>- What's up, Bill?</i>
- Oh, just checkin' on you.

181
00:13:14,943 --> 00:13:17,503
Hoping I can get that payment, buddy.
<i>- Aw, well, y'know,</i>

182
00:13:17,645 --> 00:13:19,704
<i>things have been a little slow here, y'know.</i>

183
00:13:19,847 --> 00:13:22,247
<i>I've been, uh...
really going through some rough times.</i>

184
00:13:22,383 --> 00:13:26,285
<i>How many times did you catch him,
literally with his pants down,</i>

185
00:13:26,421 --> 00:13:31,222
<i>and I'm supposed to pay for his infidelity?!</i>
- Well, you're the one that hired me, Amber.

186
00:13:31,359 --> 00:13:34,954
That's the way this works.
<i>- I'm supposed to foot the goddamn bill?!</i>

187
00:13:35,096 --> 00:13:37,257
<i>How many times, Billy? Tell me that!</i>

188
00:13:37,398 --> 00:13:40,458
- Eight times, Amber,
for a total billing of $4,000. C'mon!

189
00:13:40,601 --> 00:13:43,263
<i>- Send him the invoice, then!</i>

190
00:13:43,404 --> 00:13:46,339
<i>Listen, Billy,
I'm not paying you a fuckin' dime.</i>

191
00:13:46,474 --> 00:13:48,442
- I want my fuckin' money!

192
00:13:48,576 --> 00:13:50,874
<i>- Yeah, you'll get it. Neveruary.</i>

193
00:13:51,012 --> 00:13:52,536
- What kind of man are you, Dave?

194
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:55,410
Because I tell you, Dave,
a man that doesn't pay his debts

195
00:13:55,550 --> 00:13:59,179
is the worst kind of man there is.
Is that the kind of man you are?

196
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:01,686
<i>- Okay, okay.
I can maybe get you half by Monday.</i>

197
00:14:01,823 --> 00:14:04,815
- Alright, half is fair, I can do half.
Talk to Katy.

198
00:14:05,426 --> 00:14:06,984
- Hey, Dave. Katy.

199
00:14:07,628 --> 00:14:09,755
So what time Monday, huh?

200
00:14:09,897 --> 00:14:12,957
- I'm going to get some air.
- Okay.

201
00:14:19,207 --> 00:14:20,231
Billy?!

202
00:14:20,375 --> 00:14:21,433
Billy!

203
00:14:22,343 --> 00:14:24,709
Phone!
- Take a message!

204
00:14:24,846 --> 00:14:26,313
- It's the mayor.

205
00:14:35,023 --> 00:14:36,718
- You seem nervous.

206
00:14:36,858 --> 00:14:39,850
- Yeah, it's probably the bomb
I got shoved up my asshole.

207
00:14:42,230 --> 00:14:44,824
Too soon?
<i>- Councilman Valliant,</i>

208
00:14:44,966 --> 00:14:48,959
any comment on the Bolton Village sale?
- I think this is a sad day for New York.

209
00:14:49,103 --> 00:14:52,129
I never thought I'd see a mayor of this city,
even this mayor,

210
00:14:52,273 --> 00:14:55,765
stoop so low as to steal the homes
of 30,000 hard-working New Yorkers.

211
00:14:55,910 --> 00:14:58,708
And I guarantee you
that I will not let this sale stand

212
00:14:58,846 --> 00:15:00,404
when I'm elected mayor on Tuesday.

213
00:15:00,548 --> 00:15:03,189
<i>- Do you think the timing
of the mayor's announcement is political?</i>

214
00:15:03,284 --> 00:15:04,444
<i>- Absolutely. I know it's political.</i>

215
00:15:04,585 --> 00:15:06,951
<i>And that's not to say
that Nick Hostetler doesn't care,</i>

216
00:15:07,088 --> 00:15:09,289
<i>because evidently he cares very deeply
about two things:</i>

217
00:15:09,357 --> 00:15:12,190
<i>His own job and taking care of his buddies
on Wall Street.</i>

218
00:15:12,326 --> 00:15:15,352
<i>- Do you have a message to the people
of Bolton Village, Councilman?</i>

219
00:15:15,496 --> 00:15:17,123
<i>- Yes, I do. Help is on the way.</i>

220
00:15:17,265 --> 00:15:19,665
<i>Come Tuesday,
you will have an ally in City Hall.</i>

221
00:15:19,801 --> 00:15:22,429
<i>Vote your interests next week,
and we'll take this city back.</i>

222
00:15:22,570 --> 00:15:24,094
- Can't even get his numbers right.

223
00:15:24,238 --> 00:15:28,766
Bolton Village is home to 37,512.
And you know what this deal means for them?

224
00:15:28,910 --> 00:15:32,141
- Valliant seems to think
it means inevitable eviction, Mayor.

225
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:33,907
- Valliant thinks.

226
00:15:35,083 --> 00:15:38,018
What it means is better service,
more attentive landlords,

227
00:15:38,152 --> 00:15:41,144
somebody actually showing up
when the toilet is blocked

228
00:15:41,289 --> 00:15:42,950
or the heat's on the fritz.

229
00:15:43,091 --> 00:15:45,889
It means paint on the walls
and it means the windows fixed.

230
00:15:46,027 --> 00:15:48,154
- Valliant says Solstein Donagan's
gonna jack up their rents,

231
00:15:48,296 --> 00:15:50,093
replace 'em with yuppies.

232
00:15:51,299 --> 00:15:54,029
- This is a great deal
for the people of Bolton Village,

233
00:15:54,168 --> 00:15:56,966
and it's a great deal
for the city of New York.

234
00:15:57,105 --> 00:16:02,133
- Do you think the announcement of this deal
will, uh, add to your poll numbers, sir?

235
00:16:02,276 --> 00:16:04,141
- Well, you know, Mike,

236
00:16:04,278 --> 00:16:08,180
if the readers of the <i>New York Post</i>
want to reward competence,

237
00:16:08,316 --> 00:16:10,978
who am I to argue with that?
Excuse me.

238
00:16:11,119 --> 00:16:12,313
Yeah.

239
00:16:13,554 --> 00:16:16,318
Well, obviously,
that was some attempt at humour.

240
00:16:17,325 --> 00:16:20,624
No, call off the brigade. Bring him up.
Thank you.

241
00:16:20,761 --> 00:16:23,559
Alright, Mike, get outta here.

242
00:16:24,132 --> 00:16:26,623
Go and do the people's work.
- Good luck Tuesday, Mayor.

243
00:16:26,767 --> 00:16:28,200
- Hey, hey, thank you.

244
00:16:28,336 --> 00:16:30,668
Look - ahem - here's one for the car.
One for the wife.

245
00:16:30,805 --> 00:16:33,433
And that one for the kid.
Put it on his school bag.

246
00:16:33,574 --> 00:16:35,201
- Thanks, Mayor.
- Alright.

247
00:16:35,343 --> 00:16:37,004
- Mr. Mayor.

248
00:16:37,145 --> 00:16:38,339
- Hey.

249
00:16:38,980 --> 00:16:43,974
You know, Billy, we take threats
of terrorism very seriously around here.

250
00:16:44,585 --> 00:16:47,850
- Right.
- Even from good Catholic boys like you.

251
00:16:49,991 --> 00:16:53,222
I'm only kidding.
Look at you, lookin' all civilized.

252
00:16:53,361 --> 00:16:55,022
- It's good to see you, Mayor.

253
00:16:55,163 --> 00:16:57,222
- See this golden boy on your way in?

254
00:16:57,365 --> 00:16:59,230
- Yeah, I caught a glimpse.

255
00:16:59,367 --> 00:17:01,494
- Y'know, if I'm being honest,

256
00:17:01,636 --> 00:17:04,230
ah... I find it faintly insulting.

257
00:17:04,372 --> 00:17:08,001
- What's that, the fact that you're running
dead even with a nobody?

258
00:17:09,810 --> 00:17:12,335
- Yeah.
You were always were more balls than tact.

259
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:17,008
- Hey, I don't know what came over me, Mayor.
I'm actually trying to reverse the trend.

260
00:17:17,151 --> 00:17:19,813
- No, you shouldn't.
It's one of your strong suits.

261
00:17:20,388 --> 00:17:23,482
Scotch?
- Uh, I'm on the wagon, thank you.

262
00:17:23,624 --> 00:17:25,057
- Really?

263
00:17:25,193 --> 00:17:27,718
What about if I just, uh, pour one for you...

264
00:17:27,862 --> 00:17:30,626
and I'm gonna leave it between us
like a symbol, y'know?

265
00:17:30,765 --> 00:17:33,632
- You gonna be able to put this guy away,
you think?

266
00:17:35,036 --> 00:17:38,597
- I ever tell you about Johnny Ingrisano?
- I don't think you told me that one, Mayor.

267
00:17:38,739 --> 00:17:41,708
- Every day, growing up in Queens,
this guy would pummel me at recess.

268
00:17:41,842 --> 00:17:43,036
Every day.

269
00:17:43,844 --> 00:17:46,039
What could I do? I was just a kid.

270
00:17:47,215 --> 00:17:50,582
A couple of years ago,
I heard Ingrisano got in some legal trouble.

271
00:17:50,718 --> 00:17:53,915
The kind of trouble another guy
could get himself out of easily.

272
00:17:54,055 --> 00:17:55,613
So I got involved.

273
00:17:55,756 --> 00:17:58,725
Now, he scratches his ass
without permission,

274
00:17:58,859 --> 00:18:00,656
he spends a week in Rikers.

275
00:18:02,063 --> 00:18:05,055
Jack Valliant reminds me
a lot of Johnny Ingrisano.

276
00:18:06,567 --> 00:18:08,296
You ever do any hunting?
- Naw.

277
00:18:08,436 --> 00:18:11,428
- You should try it.
You would be a natural.

278
00:18:11,672 --> 00:18:13,230
And you'd love the dogs.

279
00:18:13,674 --> 00:18:17,041
Y'know, women call men dogs.
They mean it to suggest

280
00:18:17,178 --> 00:18:20,113
we're... somehow untrustworthy or disloyal.

281
00:18:20,248 --> 00:18:22,239
But a dog is anything but.

282
00:18:24,085 --> 00:18:25,746
And if men are dogs,

283
00:18:25,886 --> 00:18:28,252
what the goddamn hell
does that make women?

284
00:18:28,456 --> 00:18:30,754
You ever seen a bitch in heat, Billy?

285
00:18:30,891 --> 00:18:34,452
She'll grind herself across the grass
to try and get at that itch.

286
00:18:36,264 --> 00:18:39,700
And if she can find a way to sneak out
of the backyard, any dog'll do.

287
00:18:40,701 --> 00:18:43,101
- I'm not sure I'm following you, Mayor.

288
00:18:46,274 --> 00:18:49,903
- I need you to help me find the sonofabitch
who's fucking my wife.

289
00:18:51,812 --> 00:18:53,473
- You think she's having an affair?

290
00:18:53,614 --> 00:18:55,654
- I know she's having an affair.

291
00:18:55,750 --> 00:18:57,775
- Maybe you should call
the <i>Post</i> and confirm.

292
00:18:57,918 --> 00:18:59,283
- She's smarter than that.

293
00:19:00,121 --> 00:19:01,486
So is he.

294
00:19:02,923 --> 00:19:04,481
He's like a goddamn phantom.

295
00:19:04,625 --> 00:19:06,820
- Maybe he doesn't exist.

296
00:19:06,961 --> 00:19:08,724
- I still want the pictures.

297
00:19:09,297 --> 00:19:10,992
I wanna know who he is,

298
00:19:11,132 --> 00:19:12,599
I wanna know where he's from,

299
00:19:12,733 --> 00:19:15,224
I wanna know how big his dick is,
how long he lasts.

300
00:19:15,369 --> 00:19:17,428
Where do they fuck,
in hotels or at his place?

301
00:19:17,571 --> 00:19:21,007
I wanna know if he makes her come,
or if she fakes it with him, too.

302
00:19:21,142 --> 00:19:23,372
And I wanna know everything
by election day.

303
00:19:23,511 --> 00:19:26,173
- Why? What's it got to do with the election?

304
00:19:26,314 --> 00:19:28,305
- New Yorkers, they've elected drunks,

305
00:19:28,449 --> 00:19:32,180
crooks, Italians, homos,
Jews and blacks to that seat,

306
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:34,652
but they will not elect is some guy

307
00:19:34,789 --> 00:19:37,758
whose wife is fucking some other guy
behind his back.

308
00:19:38,326 --> 00:19:40,624
Now this... pussy, this Jack Valliant,

309
00:19:40,761 --> 00:19:43,093
he may be too much of a lightweight

310
00:19:43,230 --> 00:19:46,199
to use this story
if it comes across his desk.

311
00:19:46,334 --> 00:19:48,325
But his staff will not hesitate.

312
00:19:49,337 --> 00:19:51,897
- What if she doesn't see him
before next Tuesday?

313
00:19:52,039 --> 00:19:55,338
- Then it's gonna be the easiest $50,000
you ever made.

314
00:19:56,177 --> 00:19:57,974
Half now, half later.

315
00:19:58,346 --> 00:20:01,179
- Half right now?
- Right this instant.

316
00:20:01,782 --> 00:20:04,683
What do you say?
- I say yes.

317
00:20:05,186 --> 00:20:08,178
- You get me what I need.
- I will, Mayor.

318
00:20:08,356 --> 00:20:10,017
You consider it done.

319
00:20:12,193 --> 00:20:14,855
- You can get my wife's schedule
from Valerie on the way out.

320
00:20:14,995 --> 00:20:16,326
- Mm-hmm.

321
00:20:18,733 --> 00:20:20,223
- Something wrong?

322
00:20:20,368 --> 00:20:23,064
- When you called, I didn't think
it'd be for something like this.

323
00:20:23,204 --> 00:20:24,330
- Yeah.

324
00:20:26,207 --> 00:20:27,572
Neither did I.

325
00:20:32,012 --> 00:20:33,570
Hey, Billy.

326
00:20:34,048 --> 00:20:35,845
Welcome back.

327
00:20:37,017 --> 00:20:38,382
- Thanks, Mayor.

328
00:20:49,263 --> 00:20:52,096
<i>The local New York news time
is 7:52.</i>

329
00:20:52,233 --> 00:20:54,224
<i>Public housing goes private...</i>

330
00:20:58,038 --> 00:21:00,029
- You got time for breakfast?

331
00:21:00,608 --> 00:21:02,701
- Baby, have you seen my keys?

332
00:21:02,843 --> 00:21:05,368
- On the table, by your hot-sauce collection.

333
00:21:08,249 --> 00:21:12,117
So it looks like we can do L.A. in style.
I landed a pretty big contract yesterday.

334
00:21:12,253 --> 00:21:14,312
I got some cushion now.
- Yeah? That sounds great.

335
00:21:14,455 --> 00:21:17,288
I'm gonna text you all the details
for the cast dinner tomorrow.

336
00:21:17,425 --> 00:21:20,087
Okay?
- No. No, no, no. I'm not going to that.

337
00:21:20,227 --> 00:21:22,661
Those guys take that metrosexual shit
way too far.

338
00:21:22,797 --> 00:21:25,891
I don't give a fuck you wanna be
a thespian or a lesbian. That's fine.

339
00:21:26,033 --> 00:21:29,298
But when a grown man starts whipping out
a compact and a powder-puff for dinner,

340
00:21:29,437 --> 00:21:31,928
that's no good.
- Can you pretend to be interested?

341
00:21:32,072 --> 00:21:33,664
Just one night, baby, please?

342
00:21:33,808 --> 00:21:37,744
It's not every day that your girlfriend
stars in her first indie film.

343
00:21:37,878 --> 00:21:41,006
- If you ask me nicely.
- Can you, please?

344
00:21:41,148 --> 00:21:42,274
- Yes.

345
00:21:44,652 --> 00:21:47,519
Maybe put a little powder on me,
so I don't feel so left out.

346
00:21:47,655 --> 00:21:49,145
- No.
- Okay.

347
00:21:49,290 --> 00:21:52,088
But I feel uncomfortable around those people.

348
00:22:18,919 --> 00:22:22,120
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, the First Lady
of New York City, Cathleen Hostetler.</i>

349
00:22:27,661 --> 00:22:29,925
- We did it!

350
00:22:31,332 --> 00:22:34,460
Equality has finally come to New York.

351
00:22:36,504 --> 00:22:40,133
<i>Some said that now wasn't the right time
to wage this fight.</i>

352
00:22:40,708 --> 00:22:44,200
<i>Well, I say there's never a wrong time
to fight for what is rightfully yours.</i>

353
00:22:48,883 --> 00:22:52,148
I say there is never a wrong time to stand up

354
00:22:52,286 --> 00:22:54,481
to the bullies.

355
00:22:54,622 --> 00:22:56,556
<i>Even if they’re powerful bullies.</i>

356
00:22:56,690 --> 00:23:00,387
<i>Especially if they’re powerful bullies.</i>

357
00:23:00,528 --> 00:23:03,986
<i>That just makes the victory so much sweeter.</i>

358
00:23:04,131 --> 00:23:05,530
<i>Yes, ma'am!</i>

359
00:23:06,967 --> 00:23:08,730
<i>- And today we declare a victory.</i>

360
00:23:10,538 --> 00:23:14,406
<i>Today we declare,
with our hearts full and our heads high:</i>

361
00:23:14,542 --> 00:23:16,908
<i>"This is my life</i>

362
00:23:17,044 --> 00:23:20,343
<i>and I will love whom I damn well choose."</i>

363
00:23:20,481 --> 00:23:22,346
Thank you.

364
00:23:52,746 --> 00:23:55,214
- Come on, buddy, show me your face.

365
00:23:56,016 --> 00:23:57,779
Shit.

366
00:24:15,436 --> 00:24:16,733
Damn.

367
00:24:27,247 --> 00:24:30,614
- You read the <i>Times</i> this morning?
- No, I did not.

368
00:24:31,819 --> 00:24:34,447
I read the <i>Post</i>, like the rest of New York

369
00:24:35,623 --> 00:24:37,250
- Interesting editorial.

370
00:24:38,058 --> 00:24:41,118
- That rag is a glorified tabloid
for rich people.

371
00:24:41,261 --> 00:24:43,058
- You're rich, aren't you, Nick?

372
00:24:43,631 --> 00:24:45,064
Filthy rich...

373
00:24:46,066 --> 00:24:48,261
...if recent events are any indication.

374
00:24:49,837 --> 00:24:53,329
- Y'know, I heard your speech went down
like gangbusters last night.

375
00:24:53,474 --> 00:24:55,499
- Mm.
- Like the opening night of "Mamma Mia,"

376
00:24:55,643 --> 00:24:57,702
they say.
Queens doing back flips in the aisles.

377
00:24:57,845 --> 00:25:00,075
- Mm. Somebody you know attend?

378
00:25:02,282 --> 00:25:05,342
- You know who's really excited
about this new law?

379
00:25:05,486 --> 00:25:07,477
- Who?
- Artie.

380
00:25:08,656 --> 00:25:12,092
He says he's never written
so many prenups in his life.

381
00:25:13,093 --> 00:25:14,720
You remember Artie?

382
00:25:14,862 --> 00:25:16,659
- I think of him every day.

383
00:25:22,670 --> 00:25:25,104
- You didn't mention the election last night.

384
00:25:25,673 --> 00:25:27,504
- It was not the proper forum.

385
00:25:29,877 --> 00:25:31,105
- Darlin'...

386
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:34,978
...it's election season.

387
00:25:35,115 --> 00:25:36,878
Every forum's the proper forum.

388
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:40,885
Act accordingly.

389
00:25:44,124 --> 00:25:45,682
Bo!

390
00:25:46,894 --> 00:25:48,555
C'mere.

391
00:25:48,696 --> 00:25:50,687
<i>- Smile.</i>

392
00:25:52,132 --> 00:25:53,690
A little to the left.

393
00:25:59,707 --> 00:26:01,675
- This is what you do all day?

394
00:26:02,543 --> 00:26:04,773
Spy on beautiful women in swanky restaurants?

395
00:26:04,912 --> 00:26:08,143
- Yeah, if you consider the finer bodegas
of Bensonhurst swanky.

396
00:26:09,149 --> 00:26:12,209
- We should do this more often.
- Figured it was time you earned your keep.

397
00:26:12,352 --> 00:26:16,516
- Does that mean I get paid this month?
- Yep. Soon as I see that phone bill.

398
00:26:16,657 --> 00:26:18,454
- He's my brother. What do you want?

399
00:26:18,592 --> 00:26:20,082
- Send him a phone card.

400
00:26:20,227 --> 00:26:22,559
- Yeah, I should, right?

401
00:26:25,165 --> 00:26:26,860
- He doin' alright?

402
00:26:28,168 --> 00:26:32,161
- Y'know... Sing Sing ain't no place
for guys with good hearts.

403
00:26:36,944 --> 00:26:39,105
Why'd the mayor call you, Billy?

404
00:26:39,246 --> 00:26:40,804
- Ah, she's grabbing her things.

405
00:26:40,948 --> 00:26:43,280
- Shit. What do I do?
- Calm down. Look at me.

406
00:26:43,417 --> 00:26:46,113
Smile. Thatta girl.
Stand up, get your coat.

407
00:26:46,253 --> 00:26:49,051
Just keep smiling and talking, okay?
- My heart is pounding, Billy.

408
00:26:49,189 --> 00:26:50,383
- Purse.

409
00:26:51,592 --> 00:26:53,617
C'mere. Beat her to the door.

410
00:26:53,761 --> 00:26:56,855
Then get across the street so you can cover
whichever direction she goes.

411
00:26:56,997 --> 00:26:58,726
Call me when you got her.
- Okay.

412
00:26:58,966 --> 00:27:02,163
- Alright, you're my eyes. What do we have?
<i>- Uptown on Madison,</i>

413
00:27:02,302 --> 00:27:04,702
towards 45th. She dumped the friend,
picked up her bodyguard.

414
00:27:04,772 --> 00:27:07,572
<i>- Alright, keep at her pace.
No more than two bodies between you, okay?</i>

415
00:27:07,608 --> 00:27:10,805
- She's on the phone. She just took a call.
- Blackberry?

416
00:27:10,944 --> 00:27:13,811
- It's a flip phone.
<i>- Alright, I need you to get in closer, okay?</i>

417
00:27:13,947 --> 00:27:16,575
<i>Get me a name, Katy.
A place, a time, something, anything.</i>

418
00:27:16,717 --> 00:27:19,345
- Okay.
- No, no, no, I...

419
00:27:19,486 --> 00:27:22,284
I understand.
So, uh, what time, darling?

420
00:27:22,990 --> 00:27:25,857
I'll be there.
- It's him, Billy. She's arranging a meeting.

421
00:27:25,993 --> 00:27:27,654
<i>- Alright, I got her.</i>

422
00:27:27,795 --> 00:27:29,092
Yeah.

423
00:27:29,229 --> 00:27:30,924
I'll be there soon.

424
00:27:35,736 --> 00:27:38,000
Alright, go.
- Ma'am?

425
00:27:38,138 --> 00:27:41,801
Ma'am! Sorry, it's-i-i-it's yours.
I think you dropped this.

426
00:27:42,810 --> 00:27:45,005
- Yes, thank you.
- Ah, you're welcome.

427
00:27:48,248 --> 00:27:50,443
Looks like she's going to the Roosevelt.
Should we follow her?

428
00:27:50,584 --> 00:27:52,704
- No, she's gonna figure out
we were here soon enough.

429
00:27:52,820 --> 00:27:55,050
We need to find out
who this number belongs to.

430
00:27:55,189 --> 00:27:57,248
If he drives a Lexus, we got our guy.

431
00:27:57,658 --> 00:27:59,683
- Welcome back to the Roosevelt,
Mrs. Hostetler.

432
00:27:59,827 --> 00:28:01,454
- Thank you, Kenny.

433
00:28:03,831 --> 00:28:06,061
<i>- I got him.</i>
- You got him?

434
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:09,101
- Oh, I got him. And it's good, Billy.

435
00:28:09,236 --> 00:28:11,033
- How good?
- Ugh... wondrous good.

436
00:28:11,171 --> 00:28:14,197
- Wondrous?
What, they teach you that at DeVry?

437
00:28:14,341 --> 00:28:15,968
- I go to Hunter, asshole.
- Oh!

438
00:28:16,109 --> 00:28:18,543
Pardon me!
- It's a sophisticated place, alright?

439
00:28:18,679 --> 00:28:21,546
I got sophisticated friends.
We read books. We drink wine.

440
00:28:21,682 --> 00:28:23,547
- Really? Are you old enough to drink?

441
00:28:23,684 --> 00:28:26,710
- Be surprised what I'm old enough to do.
- Hey, easy, okay?

442
00:28:26,854 --> 00:28:29,846
- For example, I'm old enough to vote.

443
00:28:30,490 --> 00:28:33,584
And it might come of some interest,
when casting my ballot,

444
00:28:33,727 --> 00:28:36,696
to know
that Jack Valliant's campaign manager,

445
00:28:36,830 --> 00:28:41,164
a guy named Paul Andrews,
is fucking the mayor's wife.

446
00:28:41,301 --> 00:28:43,861
- Bullshit.
- And he drives a Lexus.

447
00:28:49,309 --> 00:28:50,742
- This is good.

448
00:28:50,878 --> 00:28:52,675
- It's borderline orgasmic, Billy.

449
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:54,939
- Did you learn that at Hunter, too?

450
00:28:55,082 --> 00:28:56,743
- Wouldn't you like to know?

451
00:28:56,884 --> 00:28:59,375
- This is not gonna go over good
with the mayor.

452
00:29:00,087 --> 00:29:02,180
That is a cold bitch.

453
00:29:04,224 --> 00:29:06,419
<i>Your attention, please.</i>

454
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:09,961

must be attended at all times.</i>

455
00:29:10,097 --> 00:29:12,338

- Montauk. Round trip. Peak.

456

<i>-... will be removed by and subject</i>

457
00:29:14,167 --> 00:29:16,965
<i>to search by the M.T.A. Police.</i>
- Thank you.

458
00:29:17,104 --> 00:29:18,901
<i>- Thank you for your cooperation.</i>

459
00:30:01,882 --> 00:30:03,008

460
00:30:05,585 --> 00:30:08,816
How you lookin' against the kid?
- The numbers are holding steady.

461
00:30:08,956 --> 00:30:10,981
- Steady?
- Yeah.

462
00:30:11,124 --> 00:30:14,525
- What the fuck does that mean?
- Steady is a prelude to a shift. Okay?

463
00:30:14,661 --> 00:30:16,652
- In what direction?

464
00:30:16,797 --> 00:30:18,321
- The incumbent, Sam.

465
00:30:18,465 --> 00:30:20,592
Always to the incumbent.

466
00:30:20,734 --> 00:30:22,634
- Really?

467
00:30:31,011 --> 00:30:32,171
- Ah!

468
00:30:33,747 --> 00:30:34,805
- Ah-hah!

469
00:30:35,482 --> 00:30:36,710
A little slow, Nick.
- Yeah?

470
00:30:36,850 --> 00:30:39,512
You just watch your ass,
I'll take care of mine.

471
00:30:39,653 --> 00:30:43,350
- Yeah, I'm beginning to wonder if you can.
- It's like Griffith and Paret... in '62.

472
00:30:43,490 --> 00:30:45,515
Emile Griffith and Benny Paret,
you remember that?

473
00:30:45,659 --> 00:30:48,685
- Yeah.
- So the kid is Paret, I'm Griffith.

474
00:30:48,829 --> 00:30:50,319
- You mean you're the fag?

475
00:30:51,631 --> 00:30:54,191
- I am Griffith minus the fag angle.

476
00:30:54,334 --> 00:30:57,633
I'm holdin' back.
I'm making him think he's got it won.

477
00:30:58,438 --> 00:31:01,066
And then comes the twelfth round, Sam.
You remember that?

478
00:31:01,208 --> 00:31:02,197
- Yeah.

479
00:31:04,945 --> 00:31:06,310
- The kill shot.

480
00:31:06,446 --> 00:31:08,038
- Fuck you.

481
00:31:08,181 --> 00:31:09,648
So, Nick...

482
00:31:10,650 --> 00:31:14,211
...I've got a half a million sunk
in your campaign...

483
00:31:15,655 --> 00:31:17,885
...and a lot more riding on the result.

484
00:31:18,025 --> 00:31:19,322
So...

485
00:31:19,459 --> 00:31:22,451
why don't you just tell me
how you're gonna win this thing.

486
00:31:31,671 --> 00:31:36,734
- We have dirt dropping on the news desks
of every paper and every network...

487
00:31:36,877 --> 00:31:38,674
across this city tonight.

488
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:43,043
- Will it stick?
- No, it won't stick, it's all bullshit.

489
00:31:43,683 --> 00:31:45,116
But it will smudge.

490
00:31:45,252 --> 00:31:47,117
And that'll get the undecideds
thinking again,

491
00:31:47,254 --> 00:31:50,246
and Sunday night at the debate,
I will put him away.

492
00:31:51,058 --> 00:31:53,117
- Well, you better, Nick.

493
00:31:53,260 --> 00:31:55,125
You just better.

494
00:32:05,505 --> 00:32:07,268
- You know who you're voting for?

495
00:32:09,276 --> 00:32:13,975
- Nah, don't think I'll make it to the polls.
I usually try to vote for president, but...

496
00:32:14,114 --> 00:32:16,912
- President doesn't determine
the quality of life in Brooklyn, no?

497
00:32:17,517 --> 00:32:19,576
- How'd you know I was from Brooklyn?

498
00:32:19,719 --> 00:32:21,880
- You just told me you were from Brooklyn.

499
00:32:22,022 --> 00:32:24,786
I'm in the business
of picking up on these things.

500
00:32:24,925 --> 00:32:26,790
- What are you, a private eye?

501
00:32:26,927 --> 00:32:28,952
- No. Private eye?

502
00:32:29,096 --> 00:32:31,291
Private eyes still exist?

503
00:32:32,532 --> 00:32:33,965
- So what do you do, then?

504
00:32:34,101 --> 00:32:35,625
- I'm in politics.

505
00:32:35,769 --> 00:32:38,237
- So who do you recommend?
- Oh, I recommend the new guy.

506
00:32:38,371 --> 00:32:42,068
- Ah, come on, he's too clean.
New York's this big, messy place.

507
00:32:42,209 --> 00:32:45,508
- Well, does it have to be?
- No, I mean, it could be better, of course,

508
00:32:45,645 --> 00:32:48,113
but it's been pretty good
the last few years under Hostetler.

509
00:32:49,749 --> 00:32:52,547
- So what do you do, then?
- I work sanitation.

510
00:32:54,554 --> 00:32:57,318
- You clean up pretty well for a garbage man.

511
00:32:57,958 --> 00:32:59,926
- I'm just doing it to impress a lady.

512
00:33:00,060 --> 00:33:01,789
- Ah, it's always a lady.

513
00:33:03,763 --> 00:33:05,321
Local 831?

514
00:33:06,133 --> 00:33:08,124
- Yeah, 15 years.
- Fifteen years.

515
00:33:10,337 --> 00:33:11,964
You own a home?

516
00:33:12,772 --> 00:33:14,603
- In New York?
- Exactly.

517
00:33:14,741 --> 00:33:18,541
So why is it that you, a union man -
and I take it a native New Yorker -

518
00:33:18,678 --> 00:33:21,579
why is it that you don't own
your own home in the city?

519
00:33:21,715 --> 00:33:24,843
Yet every Bernie and Gordon who get off
this fuckin' train with an MBA

520
00:33:24,985 --> 00:33:26,850
and low to no scruples, they own one.

521
00:33:26,987 --> 00:33:29,649
They own one in the city
and one on the island.

522
00:33:29,789 --> 00:33:31,154
So where is yours?

523
00:33:32,425 --> 00:33:33,983
I'm just saying.

524
00:33:37,597 --> 00:33:40,191
- So you own a house out here?
- No...

525
00:33:40,333 --> 00:33:41,857
No.

526
00:33:42,002 --> 00:33:45,699
No, don't get me wrong, I like the water
and the sand and the grass, but no.

527
00:33:45,839 --> 00:33:49,138
The only thing better than getting outta
that damn city is going back to it.

528
00:33:50,010 --> 00:33:53,912
Nah, just about everything and anyone
I love is in that city.

529
00:33:54,047 --> 00:33:56,038
<i>The next and final stop
will be Montauk.</i>

530
00:33:56,183 --> 00:33:58,549
<i>All passengers must depart the train
at Montauk.</i>

531
00:33:58,685 --> 00:34:01,210
<i>Please be sure to gather all...</i>
- Nice talking to you.

532
00:34:01,354 --> 00:34:03,015
- Yeah, you, too.

533
00:34:50,904 --> 00:34:52,428
Oh, shit.

534
00:35:12,525 --> 00:35:14,322
<i>Taggart Agency.</i>

535
00:35:14,461 --> 00:35:17,182
- Were you on the other line?
<i>- No, I'm trying to save your business.</i>

536
00:35:17,230 --> 00:35:19,960
- Y'know, I don't get to say this too often,
but you were right.

537
00:35:20,100 --> 00:35:21,328
<i>- Really?</i>

538
00:35:21,468 --> 00:35:24,733
- The mayor's wife
is fucking the campaign manager.

539
00:35:24,871 --> 00:35:26,133
<i>- Told you.</i>
- Call the mayor,

540
00:35:26,273 --> 00:35:28,036
tell him I got some pictures.
<i>- Okay.</i>

541
00:35:28,174 --> 00:35:30,574
- And stay off the fuckin' phone.
<i>- I wasn't a...</i>

542
00:35:32,979 --> 00:35:36,142
- Ryan, I wouldn't even be in this movie
if it wasn't for you.

543
00:35:36,283 --> 00:35:39,081
So thank you. That was really sweet.
- Mm.

544
00:35:39,219 --> 00:35:41,813
This guy right here,
we got a real civilian here.

545
00:35:41,955 --> 00:35:44,515
C'mon, William, tell us.
Wh-what do you do, uh...

546
00:35:44,658 --> 00:35:48,492
- I-I don't do anything important.
I take pictures. It's... very boring.

547
00:35:48,628 --> 00:35:51,153
- Oh, shit.
You're not paparazzi, are you?

548
00:35:51,298 --> 00:35:52,822
- No.

549
00:35:52,966 --> 00:35:56,424
I actually, uh...
mostly stick to real people, so...

550
00:35:56,569 --> 00:35:59,333
- Billy is a private investigator.
He used to be a cop.

551
00:35:59,472 --> 00:36:01,713
- Get outta here. You serious?
- Is that how you two met?

552
00:36:01,808 --> 00:36:04,606
You promised not to write her a ticket
if she goes out with you.

553
00:36:04,744 --> 00:36:06,769
- Yeah, something like that.

554
00:36:06,913 --> 00:36:09,347
- Well, details, details, tell us everything.
- Come on, Billy, details.

555
00:36:09,482 --> 00:36:12,007
How'd a guy like you end up
with a girl like Natalie?

556
00:36:12,152 --> 00:36:14,518
- A guy like me?
- Ah, I can't imagine

557
00:36:14,654 --> 00:36:17,145
you were too big on the theatre.
- This is you guys' party.

558
00:36:17,290 --> 00:36:19,491
Let's talk about your movie.
I'd rather hear about that.

559
00:36:19,592 --> 00:36:21,856
- No. No one leaves this table
without singing the blues, Billy.

560
00:36:21,995 --> 00:36:25,192
Natalie, you gotta pick up the slack here.
How did you meet this charming guy?

561
00:36:25,332 --> 00:36:29,234
- Billy was a friend of the family.
- Ah, so you guys lived

562
00:36:29,369 --> 00:36:31,997
in the same neighbourhood, or...?
- He worked by where I lived.

563
00:36:32,138 --> 00:36:34,368
- So you fell in love
with the neighbourhood policeman?

564
00:36:35,175 --> 00:36:36,472
C'mon.

565
00:36:36,609 --> 00:36:40,170
- We were just a bunch of broke Puerto Ricans
that nobody gave a damn about.

566
00:36:40,313 --> 00:36:42,042
And Billy was good to us.
- Barrow?

567
00:36:42,182 --> 00:36:43,843
Is that Puerto Rican?

568
00:36:43,983 --> 00:36:45,416
- It's actually Barea.

569
00:36:45,552 --> 00:36:47,144
- Nat... Natalie Barea.

570
00:36:47,287 --> 00:36:50,188
- Natalia.
- That actually has nice little ring to it.

571
00:36:50,323 --> 00:36:51,984
- Yeah.
- Okay, you changed it

572
00:36:52,125 --> 00:36:54,355
so you could play more Anglo?
- No.

573
00:36:55,362 --> 00:36:57,227
I changed it because...

574
00:36:57,364 --> 00:36:59,457
I was tired of going into auditions

575
00:36:59,599 --> 00:37:02,591
and the first question
out of the casting director's mouth

576
00:37:02,736 --> 00:37:05,204
was if I was related to Yesenia Barea.

577
00:37:06,373 --> 00:37:07,772
- Who's that?

578
00:37:07,907 --> 00:37:10,569
- My sister.
- Is she famous or somethin'?

579
00:37:10,710 --> 00:37:13,406
- Yeah. Her face was in all the papers
about seven years ago.

580
00:37:13,546 --> 00:37:16,106
- Nat. Please, don't...
- Beautiful 16-year-old girl

581
00:37:16,249 --> 00:37:19,514
found raped and beaten to death
in an abandoned apartment in Bolton Village.

582
00:37:26,025 --> 00:37:27,788
Billy was good to us.

583
00:37:27,927 --> 00:37:29,554
It was a really hard time and...

584
00:37:30,830 --> 00:37:32,593
...he made it better.

585
00:37:41,241 --> 00:37:44,108
<i>- Well, sure, that's because you like
to accuse anyone who doesn't agree</i>

586
00:37:44,244 --> 00:37:46,940
with letting the rich off scot-free
of engaging in class warfare

587
00:37:47,080 --> 00:37:50,481
when in reality you know full well
what real class warfare is:

588
00:37:50,617 --> 00:37:52,778
stealing the homes of working people
in Bolton Village,

589
00:37:52,786 --> 00:37:55,619
and handing them over at a cut rate
to an investment bank.

590
00:37:55,755 --> 00:37:57,814
That, sir, is real class warfare.

591
00:37:57,957 --> 00:38:00,016
- Well, maybe where you grew up
in Connecticut,

592
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:01,787
$3 billion is considered cut-rate,

593
00:38:01,928 --> 00:38:03,293
but here in New York City,

594
00:38:03,430 --> 00:38:06,797
$3 billion is considered a lot of money
that can solve a lot of problems.

595
00:38:06,933 --> 00:38:09,973
- All due respect, you don't solve problems
by bending over for billionaires.

596
00:38:10,103 --> 00:38:12,537
- Oh, I may bend over for billionaires,
but, you know what?

597
00:38:12,672 --> 00:38:14,469
You come from a long line of 'em.

598
00:38:14,607 --> 00:38:18,566
And, by the way, how are the renovations
coming on that $4 million townhouse of yours

599
00:38:18,711 --> 00:38:21,441
over in Brooklyn Heights?
- You want my house, too? Take it.

600
00:38:21,581 --> 00:38:24,550
I'm upside-down on my mortgage
like the rest of this city.

601
00:38:24,684 --> 00:38:27,312
Because the system has been rigged
by men like you.

602
00:38:30,890 --> 00:38:32,323
- Fuck, that's good.
- Yeah?

603
00:38:32,459 --> 00:38:35,326
- I like that. You make that stick,
you pull undecideds off the fence.

604
00:38:35,462 --> 00:38:37,657
- Okay.

605
00:38:37,797 --> 00:38:39,662
Alright. We need that moment. Paul.

606
00:38:39,799 --> 00:38:42,791
You know that, uh, "Senator,
you are no Jack Kennedy." That moment.

607
00:38:42,936 --> 00:38:44,836
And it's got to be Bolton Village-related.

608
00:38:44,971 --> 00:38:47,091
- I'm telling you, it's good.
You stick to the issues,

609
00:38:47,140 --> 00:38:49,335
people will see the difference
between the two of you.

610
00:38:49,476 --> 00:38:50,676
- It's not clean enough, Paul.

611
00:38:50,743 --> 00:38:54,270
It's gotta be clean-cut.
He's got this clear line of attack on me.

612
00:38:54,414 --> 00:38:57,008
I'm the rich Connecticut carpetbagger.
What the hell is he?

613
00:38:57,150 --> 00:39:00,119
- He's out of a job come Tuesday
if you stick to the fuckin' issues.

614
00:39:00,253 --> 00:39:01,880
- You're missing the point!
He's a crook!

615
00:39:02,021 --> 00:39:04,114
I need to be able to hammer that home

616
00:39:04,257 --> 00:39:07,124
when he taunts me and pokes at me
about my family money,

617
00:39:07,260 --> 00:39:10,889
Harvard and all the rest of it.
I need to be able to lay his fat ass flat!

618
00:39:11,030 --> 00:39:13,521
You, sir, are a crook and a liar!
And if he tries

619
00:39:13,666 --> 00:39:17,534
to challenge me to prove it,
I pull out that glorious piece of paper

620
00:39:17,670 --> 00:39:19,797
you said you'd provide
and I start reading out loud.

621
00:39:19,939 --> 00:39:22,464
- Let's take 10.
Can I talk to you for a minute?

622
00:39:22,942 --> 00:39:25,342
Alright, so what's your problem, Jack?

623
00:39:25,512 --> 00:39:27,810
- The Daily News is my problem, Paul.

624
00:39:27,947 --> 00:39:30,541
The <i>Post</i>, the <i>Times</i>, they're all the same.
Pick one.

625
00:39:30,683 --> 00:39:33,208
We got Hostetler backing up
a dump-truckload of shit on me

626
00:39:33,353 --> 00:39:36,379
and our campaign's coming up with piss-all
by the way of pushback.

627
00:39:36,523 --> 00:39:39,924
I thought that's what Montauk was all about.
What happened to that source of yours?

628
00:39:40,059 --> 00:39:41,959
- I'm working on it.
- So that's why you disappeared

629
00:39:42,095 --> 00:39:43,790
for nine hours yesterday?
- He kept us waiting.

630
00:39:43,930 --> 00:39:46,922
Kept us on the hook. I told you.
- You came back stinking of booze.

631
00:39:47,066 --> 00:39:49,762
- I had a fucking cocktail, sweetheart.
- So where is our pushback, then?

632
00:39:49,903 --> 00:39:53,600
- Our pushback are truth and facts, Jack.
That's how we play.

633
00:39:53,740 --> 00:39:55,901
- Where are our headlines?
That's all I wanna know.

634
00:39:56,042 --> 00:39:58,283
- I'll tell you something.
We don't need headlines, Jack.

635
00:39:58,411 --> 00:40:00,252
We don't need headlines,
because we're winning.

636
00:40:00,280 --> 00:40:02,510
Even their internal polling
has us up by three.

637
00:40:02,649 --> 00:40:04,514
You're winning on your own fucking terms.

638
00:40:04,651 --> 00:40:06,585
But let me tell you something,

639
00:40:06,719 --> 00:40:11,122
you go onto that debate stage
and you try to win that debate

640
00:40:11,257 --> 00:40:15,057
by going negative blow to negative blow,
he'll fuckin' destroy you.

641
00:40:15,194 --> 00:40:16,627
Understand that.

642
00:40:16,763 --> 00:40:19,095
- Glad you got so much faith in me, Paul.

643
00:40:19,232 --> 00:40:21,564
- I'm all faith, you smug sonofabitch.

644
00:40:22,402 --> 00:40:25,098
Why don't you try having some?
- Just do me a favour.

645
00:40:25,238 --> 00:40:26,705
Just do your job.

646
00:40:28,908 --> 00:40:30,876
Just get me that file.

647
00:40:32,412 --> 00:40:34,039
- Yes, sir.

648
00:40:46,693 --> 00:40:50,129
- Hey, Murdock.
Save some for the rest of us, will you?

649
00:40:50,263 --> 00:40:52,458
- Mm, Billy, God, holy shit.

650
00:40:52,599 --> 00:40:55,227
What are you doing here?
- I was in the neighbourhood.

651
00:40:55,435 --> 00:40:56,902
- Yeah, me, too.

652
00:40:57,036 --> 00:41:00,062
- You club a herd of penguins for that getup?
- This number? What can I say?

653
00:41:00,206 --> 00:41:02,674
Private sector's been good to me.
- Oh, you a shamus?

654
00:41:02,809 --> 00:41:04,299
- Nah, security.

655
00:41:04,444 --> 00:41:06,105
See that kid over there?

656
00:41:06,245 --> 00:41:07,906
That's T odd Lancaster. That's my charge.

657
00:41:08,047 --> 00:41:10,311
Rich kid.
Pop tears down buildings for a living,

658
00:41:10,450 --> 00:41:12,748
wants him to run the business one day.

659
00:41:12,885 --> 00:41:15,410
I'm making sure he stays
on the straight and narrow till then.

660
00:41:15,555 --> 00:41:17,489
- How you doin', Mr. Mayor?
- Tony, how are you?

661
00:41:17,624 --> 00:41:19,615
Harris, come and say hello.

662
00:41:21,628 --> 00:41:24,096
This is Harris Sargent,
SVP at Solstein Donagan.

663
00:41:24,230 --> 00:41:26,698
Helped me push through
the Bolton Village deal.

664
00:41:26,833 --> 00:41:30,030
Four billion dollars
we beat out of this poor bastard.

665
00:41:30,169 --> 00:41:32,831
- Hi, Mr. Sargent. Good to see you.
You remember my son, Todd?

666
00:41:32,972 --> 00:41:34,735
- Todd.
- If you do, you get a prize.

667
00:41:34,874 --> 00:41:37,104
- Todd, when are you gonna
do the world a favour

668
00:41:37,243 --> 00:41:40,940
and take the business from your old man?
- When I die and he grows a pair.

669
00:41:41,080 --> 00:41:42,843
- Oh, shit.

670
00:41:43,683 --> 00:41:45,207
- Some fuckin' party here, huh?

671
00:41:45,351 --> 00:41:48,184
- I'd rather be home watching the Knicks.
- Do what, lose?

672
00:41:48,321 --> 00:41:51,484
This is the best game in town, babe.
You got the commissioner over there.

673
00:41:52,291 --> 00:41:56,193
It's the worst-kept secret on earth,
him and the mayor can't stand each other.

674
00:41:56,329 --> 00:42:00,026
But the commish don't miss a party.
It's like watching Italian opera, them two.

675
00:42:00,166 --> 00:42:02,134
- What the hell do you know about opera?

676
00:42:02,268 --> 00:42:03,701
- Just 'cause I don't understand
the language,

677
00:42:03,836 --> 00:42:05,736
don't mean they ain't out
to fuck each other.

678
00:42:05,872 --> 00:42:08,136
Alright?
- Suite 5101, Mr. Taggart.

679
00:42:08,274 --> 00:42:10,174
I'm told it's urgent.

680
00:42:10,309 --> 00:42:11,674
- Excuse me.

681
00:42:12,679 --> 00:42:14,874
- In the neighbourhood, my ass.

682
00:42:34,901 --> 00:42:37,335
- May I offer you a drink, Mr. Taggart?

683
00:42:38,538 --> 00:42:40,005
- I don't drink.

684
00:42:40,139 --> 00:42:42,130
- But you used to. I can tell.

685
00:42:43,543 --> 00:42:44,567
- How?

686
00:42:44,711 --> 00:42:48,044
- By those three seconds you let pass
before turning down the drink.

687
00:42:48,548 --> 00:42:50,345
How long has it been?

688
00:42:51,150 --> 00:42:53,141
- Seven years.
- Good for you.

689
00:42:54,554 --> 00:42:56,852
Finally hit rock bottom, huh?

690
00:42:56,989 --> 00:42:58,957
- I did it to keep a woman.

691
00:42:59,092 --> 00:43:00,787
- Then you do believe in love.

692
00:43:00,927 --> 00:43:03,862
- I believe in lovin' the one you're with.
- Hmm. What are you,

693
00:43:03,996 --> 00:43:06,055
stupid or Catholic?

694
00:43:07,166 --> 00:43:08,428
- Both.

695
00:43:08,568 --> 00:43:10,559
- To your health, Mr. Taggart.

696
00:43:16,743 --> 00:43:19,940
- Well... perhaps you could explain
what I'm doin' up here?

697
00:43:21,748 --> 00:43:24,046
- Being tailed is exhausting.

698
00:43:25,184 --> 00:43:29,052
If I might pry for a moment, how much
are you being paid for your efforts?

699
00:43:29,188 --> 00:43:32,248
- Which efforts are those?
- The work you're doing for the mayor.

700
00:43:34,594 --> 00:43:36,459
I'll give you $50,000

701
00:43:36,596 --> 00:43:38,587
to give it up.
- Well, that's very generous,

702
00:43:38,731 --> 00:43:41,325
but I got a contract with the mayor.
- Break it.

703
00:43:41,467 --> 00:43:43,833
- You don't break contract with the mayor.

704
00:43:43,970 --> 00:43:46,837
- Don't I know it.
- Why don't you just leave him?

705
00:43:46,973 --> 00:43:49,464
- This is not what you think it is,
Mr. Taggart.

706
00:43:49,609 --> 00:43:52,339
- I take pictures, Mrs. Hostetler.
I don't get paid to think.

707
00:43:52,478 --> 00:43:55,675
- If the last seven years of your life
mean anything,

708
00:43:55,815 --> 00:43:59,751
if that woman you put down the bottle for
means anything... walk...

709
00:43:59,886 --> 00:44:01,285
away.

710
00:44:01,420 --> 00:44:03,479
Because if you think
you're investigating adultery,

711
00:44:03,623 --> 00:44:07,320
Mr. Taggart, you don't know
Nicholas Hostetler very well.

712
00:44:19,739 --> 00:44:21,331
- I see you've met Billy.

713
00:44:21,474 --> 00:44:22,998
- Yes, we met.

714
00:44:23,810 --> 00:44:26,108
- Did he tell you
he's doing some work for me?

715
00:44:26,245 --> 00:44:29,510
- He mentioned it.
- Did he mention it was exclusive?

716
00:44:29,649 --> 00:44:31,173
- Yes, he did.

717
00:44:31,317 --> 00:44:33,649
- You used to know what exclusive meant,
dear.

718
00:44:34,020 --> 00:44:36,784
In this case, it means I worked for it...

719
00:44:37,657 --> 00:44:39,955
...keep your grubby little paws off it.

720
00:44:41,460 --> 00:44:42,893
- Poor Nicky.

721
00:44:43,029 --> 00:44:45,827
You never did learn how to share, did you?

722
00:44:46,465 --> 00:44:50,265
Well, don't worry...
I'll teach you before it's too late.

723
00:44:51,604 --> 00:44:53,037
- Careful, dear.

724
00:44:53,472 --> 00:44:54,837
- You, too, darling.

725
00:44:56,676 --> 00:44:58,667
Mr. Taggart, please take care.

726
00:45:03,683 --> 00:45:04,980
- I need a drink.

727
00:45:11,057 --> 00:45:12,854
What have you got for me?

728
00:45:13,693 --> 00:45:15,888
- Actually, Mayor,
I think I need a few more days.

729
00:45:16,028 --> 00:45:17,791
I'm pretty sure I got things nailed down,

730
00:45:17,930 --> 00:45:19,989
I just wanna take another 48 hours
to confirm.

731
00:45:22,869 --> 00:45:27,431
- You have an envelope... of photographs
in your pocket.

732
00:45:27,573 --> 00:45:30,565
That I paid for. Right?

733
00:45:30,710 --> 00:45:31,699
Right?

734
00:45:32,311 --> 00:45:34,176
Burning a hole in your bleeding heart?

735
00:45:53,099 --> 00:45:54,259
Good work.

736
00:46:02,341 --> 00:46:04,036
Alright, Billy, we're done.

737
00:46:18,357 --> 00:46:20,985
- Hey, Ryan, you excited tonight?
- Ryan!

738
00:46:23,262 --> 00:46:25,423
- Whoa!

739
00:46:25,564 --> 00:46:27,794
Whoo!

740
00:46:48,955 --> 00:46:50,786
You go, Natalie!

741
00:46:52,458 --> 00:46:55,757
Yeah, Natalie! Whoo-hoo!

742
00:46:58,397 --> 00:47:01,594
<i>- I love the line
between the sky and the water.</i>

743
00:47:02,168 --> 00:47:04,659
<i>You see how it gets darker
the farther it is away,</i>

744
00:47:04,804 --> 00:47:06,271
<i>and it's just a line</i>

745
00:47:06,405 --> 00:47:08,464
<i>separating sky from water.</i>

746
00:47:10,676 --> 00:47:13,543
<i>He's religious.
I get it, he's gotta have hope.</i>

747
00:47:13,679 --> 00:47:15,510
<i>He's gotta have something to believe in.</i>

748
00:47:15,648 --> 00:47:18,776
<i>- Why do you have to bring him up?
What does it matter?</i>

749
00:47:18,918 --> 00:47:21,386
<i>Not everything in this life
is black and white.</i>

750
00:47:21,520 --> 00:47:24,455
<i>Let's not talk about him anymore.</i>

751
00:47:25,424 --> 00:47:26,618
<i>- Let's go.</i>

752
00:47:40,840 --> 00:47:41,807
<i>- Ah!</i>

753
00:47:55,454 --> 00:47:57,513
- Kiss of Life!
- Kiss of Life!

754
00:47:57,656 --> 00:48:00,022
Sundance, here we come!

755
00:48:02,194 --> 00:48:05,220
- Alright.
- Pretty trippy. Like it?

756
00:48:06,032 --> 00:48:08,592
- It's beautiful.
- Really?

757
00:48:12,238 --> 00:48:14,331
- Excuse me.
- Yeah?

758
00:48:14,473 --> 00:48:17,465
- Can I get a double Jameson, please?
- Yeah, you got it.

759
00:48:43,569 --> 00:48:46,129
Again.

760
00:48:46,272 --> 00:48:49,435
- You want a water back for that?
- Just pour the fucking drink, please.

761
00:48:49,575 --> 00:48:51,702
Thank you.

762
00:48:51,844 --> 00:48:53,368
- Billy, what are you doing?

763
00:48:53,512 --> 00:48:54,945
- Hey, Nat, I just...

764
00:48:55,081 --> 00:48:57,948
I just didn't wanna be the only one
not celebrating.

765
00:48:58,084 --> 00:49:00,143
- Billy, don't do this.
- It's a party, right?

766
00:49:00,286 --> 00:49:05,280
And what a fucking movie that was, Nat.
I mean, my God, I never seen you that good.

767
00:49:05,724 --> 00:49:07,954
I mean, that was incredible.
You were so convincing.

768
00:49:08,094 --> 00:49:11,291
- Excuse me.
Can you take this drink back, please?

769
00:49:11,430 --> 00:49:13,591
- Please, okay? I'm fine.
- Billy, don't!

770
00:49:13,732 --> 00:49:15,290
That's enough.
- What?

771
00:49:16,035 --> 00:49:18,799
What?
- You promised me, Billy.

772
00:49:18,938 --> 00:49:21,498
How can you hurt me like this?
- How can I hurt you?

773
00:49:21,640 --> 00:49:24,680
You haven't once asked me how I'm feeling...
- This is not your night, Billy.

774
00:49:24,810 --> 00:49:28,405
I've worked so hard for this.
It doesn't mean anything to you, does it?

775
00:49:28,547 --> 00:49:32,074
You know, why don't you go do a line, too?
Go back to being the old Billy,

776
00:49:32,218 --> 00:49:34,152
'cause everybody knows
what a great guy he was.

777
00:49:34,286 --> 00:49:37,187
I'm gonna go hang out with my friends.
- You mean Ryan?

778
00:49:37,323 --> 00:49:39,848
What, d'you fuck him?
- Don't do this.

779
00:49:39,992 --> 00:49:41,653
- Fine. I'll go ask him myself.
- Billy.

780
00:49:41,794 --> 00:49:43,421
Just go home. Please?

781
00:49:43,562 --> 00:49:45,442
- Tell me the truth
or I'll start breakin' shit.

782
00:49:45,564 --> 00:49:48,829
- There's nothing left for you to break.
- Tell me the truth.

783
00:49:48,968 --> 00:49:51,596
You told me it was gonna be artistic,
some simple love scene.

784
00:49:51,737 --> 00:49:53,762
- I can't do this anymore.
- You can't do this?

785
00:49:53,906 --> 00:49:55,669
What the fuck does that mean?!
- We're in pieces.

786
00:49:55,808 --> 00:49:58,009
We've always been in pieces.
- I'm taking you home. Now!

787
00:49:58,144 --> 00:50:00,578
- Are you not listening to me?
- No, I'm not listening, Nat!

788
00:50:00,713 --> 00:50:03,944
And you're not leaving me, not here,
not for this bunch of fuckin' assholes!

789
00:50:11,157 --> 00:50:13,682
- I can't.
- Nat. Please.

790
00:50:13,826 --> 00:50:15,794
Natalie.

791
00:50:16,996 --> 00:50:18,156
I'm sorry.

792
00:50:19,165 --> 00:50:21,463
- There's nothing left between us, Billy.

793
00:50:21,600 --> 00:50:23,227
- Don't say that. I'm sorry.
- Nothing.

794
00:50:23,369 --> 00:50:27,032
We've had a dead girl holding us
together for seven years.

795
00:50:27,173 --> 00:50:29,232
It's just not enough anymore.

796
00:50:29,375 --> 00:50:31,536
- How could you say that?

797
00:50:31,677 --> 00:50:34,908
Natalie, ple... I'm sorry.
- Nat, you alright?

798
00:50:35,047 --> 00:50:37,413
- Yeah.
- Billy, stop it! No!

799
00:50:37,550 --> 00:50:39,541
Let him go.

800
00:50:39,685 --> 00:50:41,880
Billy, please, please.
- Fuckin' actor.

801
00:50:42,021 --> 00:50:43,852
Yeah, you fucked him.

802
00:50:57,736 --> 00:50:59,294
Aw, what the...

803
00:50:59,438 --> 00:51:01,303
What the fuck are you doing?

804
00:51:01,440 --> 00:51:03,408
Wait a second. What the fuck?

805
00:51:16,222 --> 00:51:18,713
Y'know what?
I've wasted my fuckin' money!

806
00:51:18,857 --> 00:51:21,849
And I waste my fucking time!

807
00:51:47,686 --> 00:51:48,880
Natalie?

808
00:51:50,089 --> 00:51:52,080
Katy, I can't talk right now.

809
00:51:54,093 --> 00:51:55,082
What?

810
00:51:56,095 --> 00:51:58,461
Katy, don't fuck with me.
What are you saying?

811
00:52:01,267 --> 00:52:02,461
Shit.

812
00:52:07,906 --> 00:52:11,342
<i>Reports of multiple gunshots
in the vicinity of Jane and Washington.</i>

813
00:52:11,477 --> 00:52:15,243
<i>One victim reported.
Medical assistance is en route.</i>

814
00:52:15,948 --> 00:52:19,228
- Stand back. Right behind the line.
- Please, everybody, stay back.

815
00:52:19,285 --> 00:52:20,980
- Thank you.
- Hey, Tony!

816
00:52:21,120 --> 00:52:22,781
- He's with me.
- Okay.

817
00:52:24,723 --> 00:52:26,588
- Thanks for doing this, Jansen.
- You got it.

818
00:52:26,725 --> 00:52:30,161
We get the first call just after one.
Report of gunshots.

819
00:52:30,296 --> 00:52:33,356
Six more calls inside a minute, all 2-11 s.

820
00:52:33,499 --> 00:52:36,161
First units arrive
around three minutes later,

821
00:52:36,302 --> 00:52:38,793
he's already good and dead by then.
- What's it look like?

822
00:52:38,937 --> 00:52:42,065
- Well, so far, so good on robbery.
He didn't have a wallet on him,

823
00:52:42,207 --> 00:52:44,675
but his apartment's right here,
so maybe he left it inside.

824
00:52:44,810 --> 00:52:47,608
We're working on getting the landlord
down here to let us in.

825
00:52:47,746 --> 00:52:50,306
- Any cash when you found him?
- No keys, no cash.

826
00:52:50,449 --> 00:52:52,815
Like I said: so far, so good on robbery.

827
00:52:52,951 --> 00:52:56,318
So when's the last time, uh,
you seen one of these?

828
00:53:04,997 --> 00:53:06,521
- You're not really thinking robbery?

829
00:53:06,665 --> 00:53:08,189
- No, we're spinning robbery.

830
00:53:08,334 --> 00:53:10,734
Media's pushing robbery.
It's a counterfactual robbery.

831
00:53:10,869 --> 00:53:14,862
Now it's your turn, Taggart.
What the hell's this got to do with you?

832
00:53:15,007 --> 00:53:16,634
- That's funny, Billy.

833
00:53:16,775 --> 00:53:19,539
I was just about to ask you that
my damn self.

834
00:53:23,048 --> 00:53:24,811
Stay with me, Billy. This is what I got.

835
00:53:24,950 --> 00:53:27,783
I got a former-NYPD-detective-
turned-private-eye

836
00:53:27,920 --> 00:53:29,854
at a fundraiser for the mayor.

837
00:53:29,988 --> 00:53:31,421
His mother's life depended on it,

838
00:53:31,557 --> 00:53:34,390
he couldn't find the money
to afford a ticket to this thing.

839
00:53:34,526 --> 00:53:36,824
That's Thursday.
Then - this is the good part -

840
00:53:36,962 --> 00:53:42,161
24 hours later, at the murder scene
of the man running the campaign

841
00:53:42,301 --> 00:53:44,735
to unseat the mayor,
whoo, imagine,

842
00:53:44,870 --> 00:53:46,531
that very same private eye.

843
00:53:46,672 --> 00:53:48,401
Explain that to me, Billy.

844
00:53:48,540 --> 00:53:50,201
Is this Hostetler?

845
00:53:50,376 --> 00:53:53,504
Is this what you gave him last night?
You gave him Andrews?

846
00:53:53,645 --> 00:53:56,079
- I gave him pictures.
- You gave him pictures.

847
00:53:56,215 --> 00:53:58,115
Of who? Who were the pictures of?

848
00:53:58,250 --> 00:53:59,842
- His wife.
- His wife and who?

849
00:53:59,985 --> 00:54:02,579
- Oh, I can't tell you that.

850
00:54:03,822 --> 00:54:05,881
- You better start telling me something.

851
00:54:06,024 --> 00:54:08,686
Explain to me what you're doing
at my crime scene.

852
00:54:08,827 --> 00:54:12,092
- I was in the neighbourhood.
- You were just in the neighbourhood.

853
00:54:13,665 --> 00:54:15,098
Paul Andrews is dead!

854
00:54:15,234 --> 00:54:18,362
What, you think you're gonna piss on him
and walk away?

855
00:54:18,504 --> 00:54:21,098
This is an execution.
This is a fucking assassination.

856
00:54:21,240 --> 00:54:24,107
Did you finger Andrews?
This what you do now, Billy,

857
00:54:24,243 --> 00:54:25,938
you set up executions?
- Fuck you.

858
00:54:26,078 --> 00:54:27,602
- Fuck me?
- Fuck you.

859
00:54:27,746 --> 00:54:31,944
I took a job, Chief. I didn't ask questions.
I gave him pictures and I walked away.

860
00:54:32,084 --> 00:54:34,314
Oh, you think I gave him up to get murdered?

861
00:54:34,453 --> 00:54:38,014
- I think you're too damned smart to think
you were setting him up for anything else.

862
00:54:38,157 --> 00:54:39,784
- Fuck you! I did my job!
- No.

863
00:54:39,925 --> 00:54:42,393
You fuckin' knew.
- I did my job.

864
00:54:42,528 --> 00:54:44,621
- Commissioner.
- Get outta here.

865
00:54:44,763 --> 00:54:46,731
Let me tell you something, Billy.

866
00:54:46,865 --> 00:54:49,493
I'm taking Hostetler down.

867
00:54:49,635 --> 00:54:53,503
He sees election day,
it'll be from inside a cage like a monkey.

868
00:54:53,639 --> 00:54:55,630
Now, you either help me,

869
00:54:55,774 --> 00:54:58,641
or you'll be in there
with him sucking on bananas, too.

870
00:55:02,281 --> 00:55:03,646
What?

871
00:55:03,782 --> 00:55:06,273
- Commissioner, there's an issue.

872
00:55:06,885 --> 00:55:08,648
- Something up, Commissioner?

873
00:55:09,655 --> 00:55:11,885
- You're on the door, Detective.
Nobody gets in here.

874
00:55:12,024 --> 00:55:14,083
- All due respect...
- You're on the fucking door.

875
00:55:26,905 --> 00:55:28,429
Now, Jack...

876
00:55:29,475 --> 00:55:31,670
What happened tonight, Jack?

877
00:55:36,114 --> 00:55:38,548
Don't worry about him, he's with me.

878
00:55:42,488 --> 00:55:44,479
Everyone's with you.

879
00:55:45,491 --> 00:55:48,085
- I need you to look at me, Jack.

880
00:55:48,494 --> 00:55:50,553
Talk to me, okay?

881
00:55:50,696 --> 00:55:53,187
Put the whiskey down, Jack. Okay?

882
00:55:55,501 --> 00:55:57,128
Okay, Jack?

883
00:56:00,506 --> 00:56:02,133
Okay.

884
00:56:02,941 --> 00:56:06,308
You need to straighten up, Jack.
Lock the door.

885
00:56:12,150 --> 00:56:13,708
It's gonna be okay, Jack.

886
00:56:24,229 --> 00:56:26,356
Just tell me exactly what happened.

887
00:56:30,369 --> 00:56:32,360
- Y'know, you're not a real cop.

888
00:56:33,171 --> 00:56:35,139
You're just a whore.

889
00:56:54,893 --> 00:56:57,453
- We're gonna go for a walk
and get some fresh air.

890
00:56:57,596 --> 00:57:00,224
It'll make you feel better, okay?
Don't worry about that guy.

891
00:57:00,365 --> 00:57:01,855
- I wanna help you, Jack.

892
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:05,060
But I have to know what happened;
we don't have a lot of time.

893
00:57:05,203 --> 00:57:07,137
I need you to talk to me, you understand?

894
00:57:07,272 --> 00:57:09,638
- I'm done talkin' to you.
Fuckin' whore. Fuck you!

895
00:57:09,775 --> 00:57:12,141
- You're talking,
but you're not making a lot of sense.

896
00:57:12,277 --> 00:57:13,574
Clear his mind, Billy.

897
00:57:13,712 --> 00:57:15,202
- No!!

898
00:57:31,463 --> 00:57:32,589
- Okay.

899
00:57:40,238 --> 00:57:41,796
- He went, um...

900
00:57:42,808 --> 00:57:44,673
...downstairs to meet...

901
00:57:44,810 --> 00:57:46,607
Todd Lancaster...

902
00:57:48,046 --> 00:57:49,809
Called earlier and...

903
00:57:50,816 --> 00:57:53,683
...he told Paul he was ready to...

904
00:57:53,819 --> 00:57:55,252
to talk.

905
00:57:57,456 --> 00:58:00,118
He said he was ashamed of himself

906
00:58:00,258 --> 00:58:01,691
for helping us.

907
00:58:01,827 --> 00:58:03,454
But he was, um...

908
00:58:04,262 --> 00:58:07,322
...he was more ashamed of his father and...

909
00:58:07,466 --> 00:58:09,832
he just wanted it to stop.

910
00:58:13,071 --> 00:58:15,631
I think Paul lost track of time...

911
00:58:16,074 --> 00:58:19,271
...'cause he looked at the clock
and he, um...

912
00:58:20,646 --> 00:58:22,637
...just ran downstairs.

913
00:58:24,082 --> 00:58:25,640
That was the...

914
00:58:26,652 --> 00:58:28,847
...the last time I saw him.

915
00:58:29,855 --> 00:58:32,517
- Did you hear any voices outside?

916
00:58:32,658 --> 00:58:34,649
An altercation, maybe?

917
00:58:35,293 --> 00:58:36,419
- No.

918
00:58:37,663 --> 00:58:39,494
Just the shots.

919
00:58:44,870 --> 00:58:47,896
I knew I c-couldn't go out there,

920
00:58:48,040 --> 00:58:50,736
I knew I... couldn't call the police,

921
00:58:50,876 --> 00:58:52,673
couldn't be seen here.

922
00:58:54,513 --> 00:58:56,708
I knew everything I couldn't do.

923
00:58:57,883 --> 00:59:00,681
Jack Valliant, candidate for mayor...

924
00:59:02,521 --> 00:59:04,113
...couldn't do.

925
00:59:04,823 --> 00:59:07,519
You know what this means, Jack?

926
00:59:09,327 --> 00:59:12,524
- Yeah, it means I let him lie out there.

927
00:59:16,134 --> 00:59:18,568
It means I let him die alone.

928
00:59:18,704 --> 00:59:20,695
- It means you can handle this.

929
00:59:22,140 --> 00:59:23,698
Look at me, Jack.

930
00:59:24,509 --> 00:59:28,206
You are gonna be the next mayor
of New York City.

931
00:59:28,346 --> 00:59:30,337
You've gotta handle this.

932
00:59:31,383 --> 00:59:33,783
Now, you go get dressed,

933
00:59:33,919 --> 00:59:36,251
find yourself a hat and a coat with a collar,

934
00:59:36,388 --> 00:59:38,788
and we are gonna get you outta here
real quiet.

935
00:59:42,694 --> 00:59:43,718
Yeah.

936
00:59:44,730 --> 00:59:45,822
Right.

937
00:59:47,933 --> 00:59:50,026
You've gotta get him outta here.

938
00:59:50,168 --> 00:59:51,726
I'm on my way.

939
00:59:51,937 --> 00:59:53,529
- How involved are you?

940
00:59:54,940 --> 00:59:56,669
- It's complicated.

941
01:00:00,946 --> 01:00:04,677
You should give me a day
to gather my bearings. We'll talk.

942
01:00:32,778 --> 01:00:34,643
- What a fucking mess.

943
01:00:34,780 --> 01:00:36,407
- A tragedy, sir.

944
01:00:38,416 --> 01:00:41,214
- The press are gonna want heads to roll
over this.

945
01:00:42,420 --> 01:00:43,978
- I beg your pardon, sir?

946
01:00:44,990 --> 01:00:47,220
- You know how it goes, Commissioner.

947
01:00:47,993 --> 01:00:51,224
You either give 'em an arrest,
or we give them a resignation.

948
01:00:51,797 --> 01:00:54,231
- Then we'll have to give 'em an arrest.

949
01:00:59,004 --> 01:01:01,234
<i>Tragedy in the West Village.</i>

950
01:01:01,373 --> 01:01:04,831
<i>Paul Andrews, campaign manager
for mayoral candidate Jack Valliant,</i>

951
01:01:04,976 --> 01:01:07,877
<i>was found shot to death overnight
outside his Jane St. apartment.</i>

952
01:01:08,013 --> 01:01:09,973
<i>Police questioned witnesses
well into the morning,</i>

953
01:01:09,981 --> 01:01:11,676
<i>but no suspects have been detained.</i>

954
01:01:11,817 --> 01:01:14,752
<i>Police Commissioner Carl Fairbanks,
a personal friend of Andrews,</i>

955
01:01:14,886 --> 01:01:17,821
<i>says the investigation will receive
the department's highest priority.</i>

956
01:01:17,956 --> 01:01:20,948
<i>We've got a report
from the 10th St. Station...</i>

957
01:01:26,264 --> 01:01:28,027
- He was a better man than me.

958
01:01:30,268 --> 01:01:32,031
He should've been mayor.

959
01:01:37,275 --> 01:01:38,902
- You and Andrews, you were, uh...

960
01:01:39,044 --> 01:01:40,272
together?

961
01:01:40,679 --> 01:01:44,274
- There's this quote I remember.
I don't know where I heard it.

962
01:01:45,483 --> 01:01:47,280
I just always remember it.

963
01:01:49,487 --> 01:01:51,682
Maybe something I read in undergrad.

964
01:01:55,861 --> 01:01:59,297
"And it's just not popular, or safe...

965
01:02:00,065 --> 01:02:02,295
...to say that I loved him."

966
01:02:27,525 --> 01:02:29,425
<i>- Mr. Mayor,</i>

967
01:02:29,561 --> 01:02:31,586
have you spoken to Councilman Valliant?
- I have.

968
01:02:31,730 --> 01:02:34,221
I reached out to the councilman
this morning.

969
01:02:34,366 --> 01:02:36,926
I offered him
not only my deepest condolences,

970
01:02:37,068 --> 01:02:40,196
<i>but also my personal assurance
that we will do everything we can</i>

971
01:02:40,338 --> 01:02:42,772
<i>to bring the perpetrators of this crime
to justice.</i>

972
01:02:42,908 --> 01:02:45,240
<i>- Mr. Mayor, did you know Paul Andrews?</i>

973
01:02:45,377 --> 01:02:48,346
<i>- I only met, uh, Mr. Andrews a few times.</i>

974
01:02:49,114 --> 01:02:51,742
<i>He always struck me as a very genuine man,</i>

975
01:02:51,883 --> 01:02:53,783
<i>a very hardworking man.</i>

976
01:02:53,919 --> 01:02:56,752
<i>He loved this city, he loved the people.</i>

977
01:02:57,923 --> 01:03:00,790
<i>He and my wife actually were, uh...</i>

978
01:03:00,926 --> 01:03:02,621
good friends.

979
01:03:02,761 --> 01:03:04,285
So this definitely hits home.

980
01:03:04,429 --> 01:03:06,920
<i>Thank you all. Thank you all very much.</i>

981
01:03:07,065 --> 01:03:08,626
<i>-... what kind of man Paul Andrews was?</i>

982
01:03:08,700 --> 01:03:10,258
- Hang on a minute.
<i>- Well, he was...</i>

983
01:03:10,402 --> 01:03:13,838
<i>the kind of man who loved
and... and fought with his whole heart.</i>

984
01:03:13,972 --> 01:03:16,133
<i>He was a dear friend to all of us,</i>

985
01:03:16,274 --> 01:03:18,504
<i>the driving force behind the success
of this campaign.</i>

986
01:03:18,643 --> 01:03:22,135
<i>He'll be dearly missed.
- This must be an extremely difficult time.</i>

987
01:03:22,280 --> 01:03:24,441
<i>Have you considered
suspending your campaign?</i>

988
01:03:24,582 --> 01:03:26,015
<i>- No, absolutely not.</i>

989
01:03:26,151 --> 01:03:28,483
<i>The debate will continue
as scheduled tomorrow.</i>

990
01:03:28,620 --> 01:03:30,781
<i>The, uh, election on Tuesday.</i>

991
01:03:31,456 --> 01:03:35,051
<i>We refuse to allow some thug
to prevent this city</i>

992
01:03:35,193 --> 01:03:37,787
<i>from exercising its democratic rights.
Thank you.</i>

993
01:03:39,597 --> 01:03:41,963
- Paul Andrews definitely wasn't fucking
the mayor's wife.

994
01:03:42,968 --> 01:03:45,300
We're looking for a guy
named Todd Lancaster.

995
01:03:45,437 --> 01:03:47,997
Just find me what you can on him,
and... Bolton Village;

996
01:03:48,139 --> 01:03:50,039
dig up whatever you can on the sale.

997
01:03:50,175 --> 01:03:51,904
- Okay. I'm on it.

998
01:03:59,584 --> 01:04:00,983
Billy.

999
01:04:02,988 --> 01:04:05,252
You know it's not your fault.

1000
01:04:14,299 --> 01:04:15,630
- Gotta go.

1001
01:04:48,666 --> 01:04:51,226
Sir, he just walked
into Bolton Village.

1002
01:04:51,870 --> 01:04:53,235
Yes, sir.

1003
01:04:53,571 --> 01:04:55,869
Daddy!

1004
01:05:04,883 --> 01:05:08,046
<i>Drop the gun, Mikey!
Drop the fucking gun!</i>

1005
01:05:09,687 --> 01:05:13,418
<i>I didn't fucking do nothin'!
Yo, chill, man, what the fuck, man?!</i>

1006
01:05:13,558 --> 01:05:16,254
<i>It's okay, Mikey,
we just wanna talk.</i>

1007
01:06:00,538 --> 01:06:02,096
- Billy, hey.

1008
01:06:04,542 --> 01:06:08,308
Oh, Billy! Come in, come in. Hi!
<i>- Hola.</i>

1009
01:06:09,547 --> 01:06:10,980
- Where is Natalia?

1010
01:06:11,116 --> 01:06:13,311
- Actually I came alone, Mrs. Barea.

1011
01:06:13,751 --> 01:06:15,981
She's just been really busy lately
with the movie.

1012
01:06:16,121 --> 01:06:18,112
- Ah, yes, the movie.

1013
01:06:19,124 --> 01:06:22,958
<i>Natalia sa quita la ropa, como una puta.</i>

1014
01:06:23,761 --> 01:06:26,195
<i>Raul, mira quien es a qui.</i>

1015
01:06:26,331 --> 01:06:29,425
<i>- Como esta, Senor Barea?</i>
- Hi, Billy.

1016
01:06:29,567 --> 01:06:31,194
Good to see you.
- You, too.

1017
01:06:31,336 --> 01:06:32,997
- How are you, man?

1018
01:06:33,138 --> 01:06:35,436
<i>- Billy, quiere un café?</i>
- Uh, <i>mucho gusto. Gracias.</i>

1019
01:06:35,573 --> 01:06:37,302
- Okay.

1020
01:06:37,442 --> 01:06:39,774
- Good to see you.

1021
01:06:40,578 --> 01:06:41,840
- So...

1022
01:06:41,980 --> 01:06:44,380
what brings you back
to the old neighbourhood, huh?

1023
01:06:44,516 --> 01:06:47,644
- Uh, that's a good question.
I'm not really sure.

1024
01:06:47,785 --> 01:06:49,844
- Nostalgia can be hard to explain.

1025
01:06:49,988 --> 01:06:51,580
- Yeah.

1026
01:06:52,157 --> 01:06:54,352
- Hey, is everything...

1027
01:06:54,492 --> 01:06:56,460
all right between you and my daughter?

1028
01:06:57,162 --> 01:06:59,596
- Yeah.
- Yeah. Good.

1029
01:07:02,367 --> 01:07:04,130
- Why'd you stay here, Raul?

1030
01:07:04,802 --> 01:07:07,999
Wh-wh-where would we go?

1031
01:07:08,139 --> 01:07:10,059
- Anywhere. I never got it.
Natalie never got it.

1032
01:07:10,175 --> 01:07:11,836
How could you just stay here?

1033
01:07:11,976 --> 01:07:16,379
- Oh, I-I-I-I could never leave
my Yesenia behind.

1034
01:07:17,482 --> 01:07:20,747
- She's gone, Raul.
- No, Billy, no, no, no.

1035
01:07:20,885 --> 01:07:22,375
She is here.

1036
01:07:24,622 --> 01:07:28,183
Look, I know how much you gave up
that night.

1037
01:07:28,626 --> 01:07:31,823
But you... also gave us peace.

1038
01:07:35,400 --> 01:07:37,027
And you...

1039
01:07:37,168 --> 01:07:39,261
gave Yesenia justice.

1040
01:07:39,404 --> 01:07:40,632
Huh?

1041
01:07:42,207 --> 01:07:45,040
And I can't begin to tell you how much...

1042
01:07:45,176 --> 01:07:48,043
that means to me, and to my... my wife.

1043
01:07:51,649 --> 01:07:53,082
<i>Gracias.</i>

1044
01:07:53,218 --> 01:07:54,651
- So, Billy...

1045
01:07:56,054 --> 01:07:58,045
...have you seen this movie?

1046
01:08:06,431 --> 01:08:07,864
- Raise your arms.

1047
01:08:09,067 --> 01:08:11,160
- Kevin. Give us a few moments.

1048
01:08:17,075 --> 01:08:20,169
- Thank you for meeting me, Mrs. Hostetler.
- What do you want, Mr. Taggart?

1049
01:08:20,678 --> 01:08:22,236
- I wanna know what's going on.

1050
01:08:22,380 --> 01:08:25,679
- Oh, you want to know what's going on?
You couldn't care less the other night.

1051
01:08:26,251 --> 01:08:29,243
Paul Andrews was my friend, Mr. Taggart.

1052
01:08:29,387 --> 01:08:31,548
Do you understand that?

1053
01:08:31,689 --> 01:08:34,249
My very dear friend.

1054
01:08:35,693 --> 01:08:38,628
And if you weren't such a cut-rate dick,

1055
01:08:38,763 --> 01:08:41,095
maybe he would still be alive today.

1056
01:08:42,100 --> 01:08:43,692
But you are cut-rate.

1057
01:08:44,269 --> 01:08:47,466
You're cheap to hire
and you're cheaper to throw away.

1058
01:08:49,274 --> 01:08:53,142
I gave you the opportunity
to do the right thing and you refused.

1059
01:08:53,278 --> 01:08:57,009
- You're right. And I'm sorry
about your friend, Mrs. Hostetler.

1060
01:08:57,148 --> 01:08:58,945
But your husband set me up.

1061
01:08:59,083 --> 01:09:01,278
And I'm gonna destroy him for it.

1062
01:09:01,419 --> 01:09:04,013
I need you to understand that
and I need you to know

1063
01:09:04,155 --> 01:09:06,749
that I'll do whatever it takes
to bring that sonofabitch down.

1064
01:09:06,891 --> 01:09:09,291
But first you have to tell me,
what's going on?

1065
01:09:09,927 --> 01:09:13,260
- You weren't hired to look for my lover,
Mr. Taggart.

1066
01:09:14,299 --> 01:09:16,290
You were looking for my source.

1067
01:09:16,601 --> 01:09:18,501
I discovered some information

1068
01:09:18,636 --> 01:09:20,501
about the mayor a while back.

1069
01:09:21,739 --> 01:09:24,731
If it was ever brought to light,
it would ruin him.

1070
01:09:24,942 --> 01:09:27,001
I offered him a deal:

1071
01:09:27,145 --> 01:09:30,012
I get a divorce, a reasonable settlement,

1072
01:09:30,148 --> 01:09:32,139
he gets my silence.

1073
01:09:32,283 --> 01:09:33,841
- He didn't take the deal.

1074
01:09:33,985 --> 01:09:36,510
- No. He hired you.

1075
01:09:37,955 --> 01:09:39,513
It was Paul.

1076
01:09:40,958 --> 01:09:43,153
Paul gave me the information.

1077
01:09:43,961 --> 01:09:45,690
He thought by sharing it with me,

1078
01:09:45,830 --> 01:09:48,856
he would help me in my situation
and I could help him

1079
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:52,561
by looking into it from my side.
- Looking into what?

1080
01:09:52,704 --> 01:09:54,831
- The Bolton Village sale.

1081
01:09:54,972 --> 01:09:57,839
Four-billion dollars
is a helluva lot of money

1082
01:09:57,975 --> 01:10:01,240
for a few city blocks of housing projects,
Mr. Taggart, wouldn't you say?

1083
01:10:01,379 --> 01:10:04,507
- Yeah.
- It's worth twice that.

1084
01:10:04,782 --> 01:10:07,683
He's a dangerous man, Billy.
- No.

1085
01:10:07,819 --> 01:10:10,310
He only knows people that kill people.

1086
01:10:21,799 --> 01:10:24,267
<i>What do you got, Katy?
- I got a hit on Todd Lancaster.</i>

1087
01:10:24,402 --> 01:10:27,428
<i>He works for his father Sam's
construction and demolition company</i>

1088
01:10:27,572 --> 01:10:30,268
<i>called the Rochway Group.
Sam...</i>

1089
01:10:30,408 --> 01:10:34,936
<i>is one of the mayor's biggest donors,
which is interesting, 'cause the son, Todd,</i>

1090
01:10:35,079 --> 01:10:38,674
<i>is like besties with Paul Andrews.
Or, uh, he was. Sorry.</i>

1091
01:10:38,816 --> 01:10:42,980
<i>Andrews was like an alumni mentor to Todd
at Columbia. He took him under his wing,</i>

1092
01:10:43,121 --> 01:10:47,023
<i>and now they serve on a bunch of boards
for all these, like, liberal organizations.</i>

1093
01:10:47,158 --> 01:10:49,285
<i>Anyway, I got a home address for Todd</i>

1094
01:10:49,427 --> 01:10:52,863
<i>out in Port Washington,
but the office is out by the Navy Yards,</i>

1095
01:10:52,997 --> 01:10:54,828
<i>so maybe you wanna try there first.</i>

1096
01:10:54,966 --> 01:10:56,900
<i>But, um, Billy, just be careful, alright?</i>

1097
01:10:57,034 --> 01:10:58,968
<i>Paul Andrews was just murdered and...</i>

1098
01:10:59,103 --> 01:11:02,402
<i>I'm sure it's gonna be
a shit storm out there.</i>

1099
01:12:02,600 --> 01:12:04,659
- You're kidding me. You gotta be...

1100
01:12:30,962 --> 01:12:34,125
Get in here!

1101
01:12:41,706 --> 01:12:43,901
Hey, look at me.

1102
01:12:44,041 --> 01:12:46,635
You're a fucking idiot!
- Stop fuckin' hitting me!

1103
01:12:46,777 --> 01:12:49,143
- You're the reason this is happening!

1104
01:13:14,372 --> 01:13:16,806
- Shit!

1105
01:13:28,986 --> 01:13:30,385
Shit.

1106
01:13:37,862 --> 01:13:39,159
Ah!!

1107
01:13:40,197 --> 01:13:42,222
Ah!!

1108
01:13:43,768 --> 01:13:46,498
C'mon!

1109
01:13:54,211 --> 01:13:56,008
Ah, fuck.

1110
01:14:01,118 --> 01:14:03,052
- Ah!!
- Watch out!

1111
01:14:04,088 --> 01:14:05,419
- Ah!!

1112
01:14:30,615 --> 01:14:32,242
- Hope you got insurance.

1113
01:14:33,050 --> 01:14:35,314
- Why? The other guy
didn't leave his information?

1114
01:14:35,453 --> 01:14:37,614
- Nah, but we'll get him.
- How you gonna manage that?

1115
01:14:38,823 --> 01:14:40,620
- Camera over there.

1116
01:14:42,126 --> 01:14:44,959
- How long it take you to get that footage?
- Depends.

1117
01:14:45,096 --> 01:14:46,825
You got a powerful uncle?

1118
01:14:47,465 --> 01:14:48,625
- I might.

1119
01:14:52,770 --> 01:14:55,933
<i>- Thank you for calling the Roosevelt Hotel.</i>

1120
01:14:56,073 --> 01:14:58,337
- What'd you say?
<i>- The Roosevelt Hotel.</i>

1121
01:14:58,476 --> 01:15:01,343
- Yeah, I'm looking for a Carl Fairbanks.

1122
01:15:01,479 --> 01:15:04,346
<i>- I'm sorry, sir, but the Commissioner
hasn't set up his voice mail.</i>

1123
01:15:04,482 --> 01:15:06,814
<i>May I take a message?</i>
- We done here?

1124
01:15:06,951 --> 01:15:08,475
- Yeah, we good.

1125
01:15:22,099 --> 01:15:24,659
- Found a little trouble tonight, huh, Billy?

1126
01:15:24,869 --> 01:15:26,860
- Yeah, you could call it that.

1127
01:15:27,872 --> 01:15:29,669
Leave the bottle, Harry.

1128
01:15:33,110 --> 01:15:35,169
- Ah, you come here often?

1129
01:15:35,312 --> 01:15:37,746
- You trying to get in my drawers, Billy?

1130
01:15:37,882 --> 01:15:39,110
Huh?

1131
01:15:39,517 --> 01:15:41,348
What's next?
You gonna ask me for my sign?

1132
01:15:41,485 --> 01:15:44,079
- I bet you're the one
with two fuckin' faces.

1133
01:15:44,221 --> 01:15:46,883
- What, Gemini?
Close, Billy, I'm the bull.

1134
01:15:47,692 --> 01:15:49,387
What about you?

1135
01:15:49,527 --> 01:15:50,687
- Cancer.

1136
01:15:51,328 --> 01:15:53,125
Roosevelt, huh?

1137
01:15:54,131 --> 01:15:57,430
Pretty choice address for a cop.
Even if he is commissioner.

1138
01:15:57,568 --> 01:16:00,230
- I made some sound investments.
- Oh, I bet you did.

1139
01:16:00,371 --> 01:16:04,102
Not to mention that place out on Montauk?
Must've set you back a few mill at least.

1140
01:16:04,241 --> 01:16:07,574
What are you, the new Russell Simmons now?
You doin' yoga and fucking white women?

1141
01:16:07,712 --> 01:16:09,441
- That's cute, Billy.

1142
01:16:09,580 --> 01:16:11,207
- Tell me something, Commissioner.

1143
01:16:11,348 --> 01:16:14,317
The First Lady, she upstairs right now?

1144
01:16:14,919 --> 01:16:16,580
- Be careful, Billy.

1145
01:16:16,721 --> 01:16:19,554
I know that's why you were so concerned
about those pictures.

1146
01:16:19,924 --> 01:16:22,222
You were afraid you were in them.

1147
01:16:22,359 --> 01:16:24,793
That's why you took me upstairs,
and not Jansen.

1148
01:16:24,929 --> 01:16:26,897
- What do you want?
- I want Hostetler.

1149
01:16:27,031 --> 01:16:28,464
- Get in line.

1150
01:16:28,599 --> 01:16:30,590
- I almost had him tonight.

1151
01:16:30,735 --> 01:16:32,396
I had papers in my trunk,

1152
01:16:32,536 --> 01:16:34,561
a fuckin' boxful,
all with mockups and renderings

1153
01:16:34,705 --> 01:16:37,299
of some New York skyline
that doesn't exist right now,

1154
01:16:37,441 --> 01:16:39,705
but will as soon
as they tear down Bolton Village.

1155
01:16:39,844 --> 01:16:43,075
Until some goons blind-sided me.
- Yeah, we ID'ed him from his license plate.

1156
01:16:43,214 --> 01:16:44,772
- Who is he?

1157
01:16:44,915 --> 01:16:46,746
- Ex-homicide cop. Dick Murdock.

1158
01:16:46,884 --> 01:16:49,284
You know him?
- Yeah, he works for Sam Lancaster.

1159
01:16:49,420 --> 01:16:53,254
- He might work for Sam Lancaster,
but he's on Hostetler's payroll.

1160
01:16:53,390 --> 01:16:56,052
- Say again?
- All that paperwork you got in your trunk,

1161
01:16:56,193 --> 01:16:59,219
not to diminish your new beauty mark,
but it's fucking worthless.

1162
01:17:00,197 --> 01:17:02,427
Everyone knows Solstein Donagan's
gonna tear down Bolton Village

1163
01:17:02,566 --> 01:17:04,295
as soon as the political dust settles.

1164
01:17:04,435 --> 01:17:07,802
A few even know they already hired
the Rochway Group to do it.

1165
01:17:07,938 --> 01:17:10,930
- Really? So why is Paul Andrews dead
if it was such an open secret?

1166
01:17:11,075 --> 01:17:15,273
- Well, he was about to figure out the rest.
- What rest? What fuckin' rest?

1167
01:17:15,412 --> 01:17:19,542
Doesn't anybody in this town
speak in complete fuckin' sentences anymore?

1168
01:17:20,785 --> 01:17:25,848
- Todd Lancaster was meeting with Andrews
that night to bring him a contract.

1169
01:17:25,990 --> 01:17:28,288
Somebody didn't want that to happen.

1170
01:17:28,425 --> 01:17:33,294
Now, I myself almost secured the contract
from Todd, but now he's not talking.

1171
01:17:33,430 --> 01:17:34,795
He's scared.

1172
01:17:35,800 --> 01:17:39,429
- Well, the contract is proof of the deal
to tear down Bolton Village.

1173
01:17:40,237 --> 01:17:42,797
- That's part of it.

1174
01:17:45,843 --> 01:17:47,640
Only Todd Lancaster knows the other part.

1175
01:17:49,814 --> 01:17:51,042
Harry.

1176
01:17:51,182 --> 01:17:54,481
- Whatever he wants. On me.
- Good night, Commissioner.

1177
01:17:54,618 --> 01:17:56,245
Good night, Commissioner.

1178
01:18:04,028 --> 01:18:05,655
<i>Places, everyone.</i>

1179
01:18:05,796 --> 01:18:07,263
We're live in five.

1180
01:18:11,268 --> 01:18:12,860
- Good evening, New York.

1181
01:18:13,003 --> 01:18:16,200
And welcome to third and final
New York City mayoral debate.

1182
01:18:16,340 --> 01:18:19,002
At this time,
join me in welcoming our candidates:

1183
01:18:19,143 --> 01:18:21,668
Mayor Nicholas Hostetler
and Councilman Jack Valliant.

1184
01:18:31,689 --> 01:18:33,850
- Hey. How much?

1185
01:18:33,991 --> 01:18:36,186
- Manual windows?
- Yeah.

1186
01:18:36,327 --> 01:18:38,261
- That's how you got
those masculine forearms.

1187
01:18:38,395 --> 01:18:40,363
- Where'd you think I got 'em,
from stroking your ego?

1188
01:18:40,497 --> 01:18:43,193
Big booty: good.
Big forearms: no good.

1189
01:18:43,334 --> 01:18:46,235
C'mon, let me drive. What the fuck?

1190
01:18:46,370 --> 01:18:48,930
- You're an asshole!
- I didn't do it on purpose! Let me drive.

1191
01:18:49,073 --> 01:18:51,940
- Oh, my God! You ruined my car
before you even started driving it.

1192
01:18:52,076 --> 01:18:53,509
- I apologize.
- Where are we goin' again?

1193
01:18:53,644 --> 01:18:56,169
- Don't worry about it. Get in.
- What do you think I'm doing?

1194
01:18:56,313 --> 01:18:59,578
- Whoa. Where'd you get these seat covers,
the Gaza Strip?

1195
01:18:59,717 --> 01:19:03,551
- In a Valliant administration,
we will be focusing on two key principals:

1196
01:19:03,687 --> 01:19:06,622
Shared responsibility and shared sacrifice.

1197
01:19:06,757 --> 01:19:10,818
<i>For those of you who are fortunate enough
to earn more than $200,000 a year,</i>

1198
01:19:10,961 --> 01:19:13,555
<i>we'll ask that you pay
a little more in taxes.</i>

1199
01:19:13,697 --> 01:19:17,599
<i>For those of you who don't,
well, we'll bring down the payroll tax.</i>

1200
01:19:17,735 --> 01:19:20,135
It's responsible and it moves us forward

1201
01:19:20,271 --> 01:19:21,932
towards a balanced budget
and a secure future.

1202
01:19:23,540 --> 01:19:24,939
- Mayor.

1203
01:19:25,075 --> 01:19:27,339
- I think it is laughable that my opponent

1204
01:19:27,478 --> 01:19:29,469
can be up here
espousing fiscal responsibility

1205
01:19:29,613 --> 01:19:34,573
when it is a known fact he has never
met a tax he didn't want to raise.

1206
01:19:34,718 --> 01:19:36,481
- Ooh...
- This coming from the man

1207
01:19:36,620 --> 01:19:38,986
whose policies landed us
in a billion-dollar deficit.

1208
01:19:39,123 --> 01:19:41,023
- No, this is coming from the mayor

1209
01:19:41,158 --> 01:19:43,126
who got us out of it.
- Yeah!

1210
01:19:43,260 --> 01:19:45,751
- By selling New Yorkers' homes
out from underneath them.

1211
01:19:45,896 --> 01:19:47,761
By selling public housing

1212
01:19:47,898 --> 01:19:49,422
to a Wall Street equity firm.

1213
01:19:49,566 --> 01:19:52,807
I believe the residents of Bolton Village
would have much preferred a tax increase

1214
01:19:52,937 --> 01:19:54,962
to an eviction notice.

1215
01:19:55,105 --> 01:19:57,596
- I'm telling you this, Councilman:
no matter where a New Yorker lives,

1216
01:19:57,741 --> 01:20:00,642
<i>nobody wants a tax increase.</i>

1217
01:20:00,778 --> 01:20:02,109
- Nor do I.

1218
01:20:02,246 --> 01:20:05,943
And I believe it's time that you told
the truth about the Bolton Village deal.

1219
01:20:06,083 --> 01:20:09,450
- Here's the truth:
We have a $3 billion surplus.

1220
01:20:09,586 --> 01:20:13,579
Now, we can use that
to put our people back to work.

1221
01:20:13,724 --> 01:20:17,455
We can use that to bring tax relief to folks.

1222
01:20:17,594 --> 01:20:21,690
That's the truth.
- No, that's not even close to the truth.

1223
01:20:21,832 --> 01:20:24,323
You made a sweetheart deal
with Solstein Donagan to line

1224
01:20:24,468 --> 01:20:26,129
your own pockets.
To buy your way

1225
01:20:26,270 --> 01:20:30,206
out of a deficit that your broken policies
created in the first place.

1226
01:20:30,341 --> 01:20:31,831
<i>The truth of the matter is,</i>

1227
01:20:31,976 --> 01:20:35,935
<i>you continue to lie to the good people
of this city about their intentions.</i>

1228
01:20:36,080 --> 01:20:39,846
<i>Solstein Donagan did not buy Bolton Village
to get into the landlord business.</i>

1229
01:20:39,984 --> 01:20:43,545
<i>Solstein Donagan bought Bolton Village
to get into the skyline business.</i>

1230
01:20:43,687 --> 01:20:45,985
Pure and simple.
- Peter, I believe we've gone

1231
01:20:46,123 --> 01:20:49,581
into the area of slander.
- Solstein Donagan, in their 50-year history,

1232
01:20:49,727 --> 01:20:52,321
has never bought a property
intended for residential use,

1233
01:20:52,463 --> 01:20:55,057
and I highly doubt they intend to start now.

1234
01:20:55,199 --> 01:20:58,498
- I don't how much clearer
I can make it for you.

1235
01:20:58,635 --> 01:21:00,500
<i>To the people of Bolton Village,</i>

1236
01:21:00,637 --> 01:21:03,504
<i>there's only one reason I got into this deal.</i>

1237
01:21:03,640 --> 01:21:05,540
<i>Because I want better for you.</i>

1238
01:21:05,676 --> 01:21:07,075
There is a new day dawning

1239
01:21:07,211 --> 01:21:10,180
<i>in Bolton Village.
And if Solstein Donagan,</i>

1240
01:21:10,314 --> 01:21:14,080
if they step out of line,
if they don't fulfill their promises,

1241
01:21:14,218 --> 01:21:17,710
<i>then I will smack them back into shape.</i>

1242
01:21:17,855 --> 01:21:19,755
<i>That is my oath.</i>

1243
01:21:19,890 --> 01:21:21,881
- Well, unfortunately for you, Mayor,
we're all well aware

1244
01:21:22,026 --> 01:21:24,051
what that oath has been worth.
- The fact remains,

1245
01:21:24,194 --> 01:21:25,855
the debt is gone.

1246
01:21:25,996 --> 01:21:28,036
- There are other ways
to move us toward solvency...

1247
01:21:28,065 --> 01:21:29,862
- Name one.
- ... Besides larceny.

1248
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:31,399
I'll tell you

1249
01:21:31,535 --> 01:21:34,135
<i>what I would've done.
First, I would've done something my opponent</i>

1250
01:21:34,238 --> 01:21:36,604
<i>clearly feels is beneath him
and that is to seek</i>

1251
01:21:36,740 --> 01:21:38,765
the counsel of my betters
on this crucial issue.

1252
01:21:38,909 --> 01:21:41,878
I would've convened a panel of respected
economists to help us solve this.

1253
01:21:42,012 --> 01:21:43,809
- Respected economists
to have an in-depth look...

1254
01:21:43,947 --> 01:21:45,972
We all know about that panel, Councilman.
- Legality and...

1255
01:21:46,116 --> 01:21:48,846
- That's the same panel
that put us into default in the '80s.

1256
01:21:48,986 --> 01:21:51,477
New Yorkers need more than a panel, son,
they want solutions.

1257
01:21:51,622 --> 01:21:54,352
- New Yorkers want...
- There is only one person up on this stage

1258
01:21:54,491 --> 01:21:56,118
in the business of providing solutions.

1259
01:21:56,260 --> 01:21:58,023
The other one up here is in the business

1260
01:21:58,162 --> 01:22:00,443
of saying how dire the situation is...
- Is this a debate,

1261
01:22:00,531 --> 01:22:04,297
<i>or are we being treated
to a Nick Hostetler soliloquy?</i>

1262
01:22:04,435 --> 01:22:06,096
The issue is dire.

1263
01:22:06,236 --> 01:22:08,932
Because you and your cronies
have rigged the game.

1264
01:22:09,073 --> 01:22:13,407
And honest, hardworking New Yorkers
recognize that nothing will change.

1265
01:22:13,544 --> 01:22:17,241
Nothing will ever change
if we continue to elect men like this.

1266
01:22:17,381 --> 01:22:19,508
- Tell me things have not changed!

1267
01:22:20,084 --> 01:22:22,211
When I was elected mayor,

1268
01:22:22,352 --> 01:22:24,946
this was a broken city.
Broken.

1269
01:22:25,089 --> 01:22:27,956
Step by step, I've been getting it fixed.

1270
01:22:28,092 --> 01:22:31,584
Bolton Village
is just another one of those steps.

1271
01:22:31,728 --> 01:22:33,025
Tell me things haven't changed.

1272
01:22:33,163 --> 01:22:37,156
I just stood before you all
and told you we have a $3 billion surplus...

1273
01:22:37,301 --> 01:22:39,826
- Mayor...
- Tell me things haven't changed.

1274
01:22:39,970 --> 01:22:41,938
No other mayor
in the history of this great city

1275
01:22:42,072 --> 01:22:44,836
has been able to stand in front of the people
and tell them that!

1276
01:22:44,975 --> 01:22:47,656
When you step out of your house,
in the morning, with your children,

1277
01:22:47,678 --> 01:22:50,408
you take 'em to the parks
of the five boroughs, d'you feel safe?

1278
01:22:50,547 --> 01:22:51,946
Yes, you do,

1279
01:22:52,082 --> 01:22:54,642
'cause I get your letters and I know you do.

1280
01:22:54,785 --> 01:22:57,310
That's us, working together,
getting it fixed.

1281
01:22:57,454 --> 01:22:59,251
Tell me things haven't changed.

1282
01:22:59,389 --> 01:23:01,619
- Yeah!
- That's right, Mayor!

1283
01:23:05,329 --> 01:23:08,958
- Councilman Valliant,
the original question still remains.

1284
01:23:09,099 --> 01:23:11,727
What would you have done
to reverse the debt?

1285
01:23:12,970 --> 01:23:14,904
- Tha...
- Don't worry about it, Councilman!

1286
01:23:15,038 --> 01:23:17,006
Nicky fixed it.

1287
01:23:29,153 --> 01:23:31,212
- Two honks for trouble. Got it.

1288
01:23:31,355 --> 01:23:33,653
- Lean your seat back all the way, okay?
- Okay.

1289
01:23:33,790 --> 01:23:35,155
- I'll be right back.

1290
01:24:01,652 --> 01:24:03,051
You know who I am?
- No!

1291
01:24:03,187 --> 01:24:05,587
- 'Cause I know who you are, Todd.
I know what you are,

1292
01:24:05,722 --> 01:24:07,349
you piece of shit!
- What? Watch it! Ah!

1293
01:24:07,491 --> 01:24:09,220
- You set up Andrews to die!
- No. No.

1294
01:24:09,359 --> 01:24:11,079
- You set him up!
You arranged that meeting,

1295
01:24:11,195 --> 01:24:13,026
and you lured him out!
- No, I didn't.

1296
01:24:13,163 --> 01:24:15,893
- You let him walk into an ambush.
- No, I didn't kill him!

1297
01:24:16,033 --> 01:24:18,866
- You want to fuckin' play games with me?!
Shut your fuckin' mouth!

1298
01:24:19,002 --> 01:24:21,283
You're a fucking liar. You're a liar.
- I didn't kill him.

1299
01:24:21,338 --> 01:24:23,704
- Ah... Ah... Ah, no.
- You wanna lie to me?

1300
01:24:23,840 --> 01:24:25,603
- I'm not lying.

1301
01:24:25,742 --> 01:24:27,607
He was my friend.
- What?!

1302
01:24:27,744 --> 01:24:29,871
- He was my friend!!
- Get up!

1303
01:24:30,013 --> 01:24:31,207
Now!

1304
01:24:32,683 --> 01:24:35,709
What are you saying?
Tell me what the fuck is going on!

1305
01:24:35,852 --> 01:24:37,251
- Please stop hitting me!

1306
01:24:37,387 --> 01:24:39,150
I didn't know!

1307
01:24:40,224 --> 01:24:42,419
I was just there to give him something!

1308
01:24:42,559 --> 01:24:45,460
I-I was down on the corner
and I was waiting for him,

1309
01:24:45,596 --> 01:24:47,427
and I saw him coming down the stairs

1310
01:24:47,564 --> 01:24:49,088
and I waved, okay?

1311
01:24:49,233 --> 01:24:52,669
I was gonna give him something
to help Valliant win!

1312
01:24:52,803 --> 01:24:55,636
To help Valliant bring down
that sonofabitch Hostetler!

1313
01:24:55,772 --> 01:24:58,570
- That doesn't make any sense, Todd.
Hostetler's your father's friend.

1314
01:24:58,709 --> 01:25:00,233
- Fuck my father!!

1315
01:25:01,612 --> 01:25:03,512
I had the contract in my hand.

1316
01:25:04,681 --> 01:25:07,775
And... Paul, he saw me waving

1317
01:25:07,918 --> 01:25:09,317
and he smiled.

1318
01:25:11,088 --> 01:25:15,422
Murdock, he must've followed me in his car.
And then he got out,

1319
01:25:15,559 --> 01:25:18,494
he shot him, man!
He shot him in the fucking head!

1320
01:25:18,629 --> 01:25:22,429
And then he showed up to work the next day
like nothing had happened.

1321
01:25:22,566 --> 01:25:26,263
- Todd, it's alright. Look at me. Look at me.
Calm down, okay?

1322
01:25:26,470 --> 01:25:28,529
Where's that contract?

1323
01:25:39,716 --> 01:25:41,047
- Take it.

1324
01:25:41,485 --> 01:25:43,282
I don't want it anymore.

1325
01:25:50,127 --> 01:25:52,789
- Are you sure you're ready
to do this to your father?

1326
01:25:52,929 --> 01:25:54,829
- Yeah.

1327
01:25:54,965 --> 01:25:56,489
- Shit.

1328
01:25:56,633 --> 01:25:58,225
Get upstairs. Go!

1329
01:26:33,170 --> 01:26:35,365
That was an accident.

1330
01:26:35,505 --> 01:26:39,032
It's Taggart, alright? Just calm down.
- Motherfucking fuck! Fuck!

1331
01:26:39,176 --> 01:26:41,644
- Ah!

1332
01:27:20,384 --> 01:27:21,817
You okay?

1333
01:27:22,819 --> 01:27:24,013
- Yeah.

1334
01:27:25,389 --> 01:27:26,822
Are you okay?

1335
01:27:28,225 --> 01:27:30,022
- Yeah, I'm alright.

1336
01:28:07,431 --> 01:28:10,264
You got those reporters' email addresses?
- Yep.

1337
01:28:11,435 --> 01:28:13,232
Billy, you sure about this?

1338
01:28:14,271 --> 01:28:17,468
- If you don't hear from me in two hours,
you send that email okay?

1339
01:28:18,074 --> 01:28:19,063
- Okay.

1340
01:28:22,446 --> 01:28:24,539
- Thanks for being there, Katy.

1341
01:28:26,450 --> 01:28:27,644
- Every time.

1342
01:28:42,098 --> 01:28:45,761
<i>- Good evening. May I help you?</i>
- Yeah, tell the mayor it's Billy Taggart.

1343
01:28:45,902 --> 01:28:47,460
<i>- One moment, please.</i>

1344
01:29:11,328 --> 01:29:12,693
Mr. Mayor.

1345
01:29:13,930 --> 01:29:14,897
- Billy.

1346
01:29:15,031 --> 01:29:16,555
What a nice surprise.

1347
01:29:16,700 --> 01:29:18,327
Thank you, Valerie.

1348
01:29:19,936 --> 01:29:22,302
VCR. I haven't used one in years.

1349
01:29:23,840 --> 01:29:26,138
Take your coat?
- No, I'm good.

1350
01:29:27,344 --> 01:29:30,279
- I have to say, Billy,
you're looking a little worse for wear.

1351
01:29:30,947 --> 01:29:32,812
- I got into a bit of a thing.

1352
01:29:33,517 --> 01:29:35,508
- Well, I'm glad you made it out.

1353
01:29:36,953 --> 01:29:39,319
Drink?
- Yeah, make it a double.

1354
01:29:39,956 --> 01:29:41,514
- Atta boy, Billy.

1355
01:29:42,526 --> 01:29:43,720
Alright.

1356
01:29:46,963 --> 01:29:48,157
So...

1357
01:29:48,965 --> 01:29:50,956
...how did Fitzgerald say it?

1358
01:29:51,968 --> 01:29:56,530
"To the orgiastic future that year by year
recedes before us."

1359
01:29:57,173 --> 01:29:58,367
Cheers.

1360
01:30:02,245 --> 01:30:05,237
I don't even know what that means.
- Me neither.

1361
01:30:05,382 --> 01:30:08,374
- What can I do for you, Billy?

1362
01:30:09,986 --> 01:30:11,977
- I wanna know why you hired me.

1363
01:30:12,556 --> 01:30:14,990
- Stick with the adultery narrative.

1364
01:30:15,392 --> 01:30:16,552
It's sexier.

1365
01:30:16,693 --> 01:30:18,422
- Yeah, lies are always sexier.

1366
01:30:18,562 --> 01:30:21,053
Unfortunately, I've had enough this week
to last me a lifetime,

1367
01:30:21,197 --> 01:30:23,529
so why don't you just tell me
the fuckin' truth?

1368
01:30:25,769 --> 01:30:27,430
- The truth is...

1369
01:30:27,571 --> 01:30:29,368
I hired you...

1370
01:30:30,006 --> 01:30:31,564
...to investigate my wife.

1371
01:30:31,708 --> 01:30:33,471
- Investigate her for what?

1372
01:30:33,610 --> 01:30:36,579
- For not minding her own business,
is for what.

1373
01:30:36,780 --> 01:30:39,214
For having a big mouth, is for what.

1374
01:30:40,016 --> 01:30:42,416
For asking too many questions, is for what.

1375
01:30:42,552 --> 01:30:44,577
You better be careful
following her example, Billy.

1376
01:30:44,721 --> 01:30:47,588
I might have to hire someone
to investigate you.

1377
01:30:47,724 --> 01:30:49,954
- Who you gonna have do that?
Your boy Murdock?

1378
01:30:50,093 --> 01:30:52,584
I don't think he's available for the job.

1379
01:30:53,797 --> 01:30:57,198
- I hope he didn't suffer.
- No more than Andrews did.

1380
01:30:58,034 --> 01:31:01,265
- Damn shame what happened to that man.
- So tell me this, then, Mayor.

1381
01:31:01,404 --> 01:31:05,864
Did you really think I'd let you turn me
into an accessory to murder? For $50,000?

1382
01:31:06,009 --> 01:31:08,102
What, d'you think
I wouldn't ask any questions?

1383
01:31:08,244 --> 01:31:10,405
Or d'you think I wouldn't get any answers?

1384
01:31:11,047 --> 01:31:13,515
- What answers you got, Billy?
- Oh, I know Andrews

1385
01:31:13,650 --> 01:31:17,108
was about to link you to Bolton Village.
That's the reason you got rid of him.

1386
01:31:17,253 --> 01:31:20,313
- No, sir. Not me.
- Not you.

1387
01:31:20,457 --> 01:31:22,288
The man you hired. Murdock.

1388
01:31:22,425 --> 01:31:24,620
- Try getting that testimony.

1389
01:31:24,761 --> 01:31:27,093
- Yeah. You're good, Mayor.
I give you that.

1390
01:31:27,230 --> 01:31:29,323
You got it all worked out, huh?

1391
01:31:29,466 --> 01:31:31,661
The denial about Bolton Village.

1392
01:31:31,801 --> 01:31:34,793
The discount to Solstein Donagan.
The new big contract

1393
01:31:34,938 --> 01:31:38,601
to the Rochway Group.
Nobody can do a goddamn thing about it, huh?

1394
01:31:38,742 --> 01:31:41,870
'Cause anybody that could is either dead
or you bought 'em.

1395
01:31:42,012 --> 01:31:44,640
I'm fuckin' impressed, Mayor. You're good.

1396
01:31:44,781 --> 01:31:47,648
- Perhaps that's why the people
keep electing me, Billy.

1397
01:31:48,485 --> 01:31:51,045
Because I simply get the job done.

1398
01:31:51,187 --> 01:31:54,020
- So all this, it was all for the city?

1399
01:31:54,157 --> 01:31:56,489
- Everything I do is for this great city.

1400
01:31:56,626 --> 01:31:59,527
- The city doesn't own 50%
of Rochway Group, Mayor.

1401
01:31:59,663 --> 01:32:01,130
You do.

1402
01:32:01,865 --> 01:32:03,799
Look what I got.

1403
01:32:08,872 --> 01:32:10,999
- What you got in your hand?

1404
01:32:11,141 --> 01:32:12,768
- It's your fuckin' jugular, Mayor.

1405
01:32:15,645 --> 01:32:18,671
Fifty percent of $4 billion
is a lot of fucking money.

1406
01:32:19,883 --> 01:32:22,443
So here's how this works.
I got an email in my outbox

1407
01:32:22,585 --> 01:32:25,019
with a scanned copy
of that Rochway contract attached to it.

1408
01:32:25,155 --> 01:32:27,180
I click one button
and 100 different newsmen

1409
01:32:27,323 --> 01:32:29,416
are gonna read your name
alongside Sam Lancaster's

1410
01:32:29,559 --> 01:32:30,992
in black and white.

1411
01:32:31,127 --> 01:32:33,618
Don't worry Mayor,
I got the original nice and safe.

1412
01:32:33,763 --> 01:32:36,254
You resign, you step down,
I'll keep my mouth shut.

1413
01:32:36,399 --> 01:32:38,526
Those emails'll never see the light of day.

1414
01:32:38,668 --> 01:32:40,693
But that Bolton Village deal... is dead.

1415
01:32:40,837 --> 01:32:44,933
Now you wanna tear down
100 other projects as a civilian, so be it.

1416
01:32:45,075 --> 01:32:48,408
But Bolton Village is gonna stand
and you're gonna walk away.

1417
01:32:48,545 --> 01:32:50,911
That's the deal, Mayor.
I suggest you take it.

1418
01:32:51,047 --> 01:32:52,139
- Counteroffer.
- No need.

1419
01:32:52,282 --> 01:32:55,274
I got nothing left for you to threaten.

1420
01:32:55,418 --> 01:32:58,410
- I want the originals,
I want all the copies,

1421
01:32:58,555 --> 01:33:00,580
and I want your case file.

1422
01:33:00,724 --> 01:33:02,715
By... 9 a.m. tomorrow.

1423
01:33:02,859 --> 01:33:04,349
- You're done, motherfucker.

1424
01:33:04,928 --> 01:33:08,694
You are done.
- You ever spend a goddamned minute

1425
01:33:08,832 --> 01:33:11,392
thinking why I chose you, Taggart?

1426
01:33:11,534 --> 01:33:13,559
And I did choose you.

1427
01:33:14,370 --> 01:33:16,167
I chose you.

1428
01:33:17,574 --> 01:33:19,337
Because I own you.

1429
01:33:20,376 --> 01:33:23,743
Now, you'll gonna have to excuse
the quality of the videotape.

1430
01:33:24,748 --> 01:33:28,240
It was shot on one of those camcorders
they used to sell you hot,

1431
01:33:28,384 --> 01:33:29,942
40 bucks on 8th Avenue.

1432
01:33:31,387 --> 01:33:33,855
But I think you're about to see
the big picture.

1433
01:33:35,225 --> 01:33:36,487
<i>- Hey, yo!</i>

1434
01:33:36,626 --> 01:33:38,753
<i>First off, let me say welcome.</i>

1435
01:33:38,895 --> 01:33:41,591
<i>Welcome to Bolton Village.</i>
- What the fuck is this?

1436
01:33:41,731 --> 01:33:42,925
<i>- Ah, what's your name, fool?</i>

1437
01:33:43,066 --> 01:33:46,331
<i>- They call me Alex, but you can call me...</i>
- What the fuck is this?!

1438
01:33:46,469 --> 01:33:48,460
<i>- ... EI Guapo!
- EI Stupid.</i>

1439
01:33:48,605 --> 01:33:52,097
<i>Yo, we just coolin' out,
me and my man David on the camcorder.</i>

1440
01:33:52,242 --> 01:33:53,641
<i>- Hell, yes, the boy David.</i>

1441
01:33:53,777 --> 01:33:55,642
<i>Hello.</i>

1442
01:33:55,779 --> 01:33:58,441
<i>- No, no, wait. I got a pocketful of cash,</i>

1443
01:33:58,581 --> 01:34:03,348
<i>and we looking to have some fun tonight.
So we gonna hit up the usual spots,</i>

1444
01:34:03,486 --> 01:34:05,545
<i>maybe get into something unusual.
- Hell yeah.</i>

1445
01:34:05,688 --> 01:34:08,452
<i>Drop the gun, Mikey!
Drop the fucking gun!</i>

1446
01:34:08,491 --> 01:34:11,460
<i>- What the fuck?!
- Drop the fucking gun!</i>

1447
01:34:11,594 --> 01:34:14,275
<i>- Yo, chill, man! What the fuck?
- Mikey, we just wanna talk.</i>

1448
01:34:24,641 --> 01:34:27,405
<i>Drop the fucking gun.
- Man, what the fuck, man?</i>

1449
01:34:27,544 --> 01:34:29,739
<i>- It's okay, Mikey. We just wanna talk.</i>

1450
01:34:34,017 --> 01:34:36,747
<i>- Oh, shit, man!
C'mon, get the fuck outta here!</i>

1451
01:34:50,967 --> 01:34:53,663
<i>Oh, shit, man!
C'mon, get the fuck out of here!</i>

1452
01:34:58,274 --> 01:35:00,435
- How's your memory now, Billy?

1453
01:35:04,681 --> 01:35:07,275
Now, there's something
that your average citizen...

1454
01:35:09,886 --> 01:35:11,683
...just wouldn't understand.

1455
01:35:12,856 --> 01:35:14,289
But I do.

1456
01:35:15,859 --> 01:35:17,690
You see, we...

1457
01:35:17,827 --> 01:35:19,954
we take because we can.

1458
01:35:20,864 --> 01:35:22,297
We take...

1459
01:35:23,700 --> 01:35:25,292
...because it feels good.

1460
01:35:26,836 --> 01:35:29,304
The only difference between you and I...

1461
01:35:30,073 --> 01:35:32,598
...is that you've gone and done it
on videotape.

1462
01:35:32,742 --> 01:35:35,040
Like I was saying, I want the original,

1463
01:35:35,178 --> 01:35:38,705
all the copies and the case file,
by the morning.

1464
01:35:39,315 --> 01:35:40,873
You can have this copy.

1465
01:35:41,317 --> 01:35:44,878
I transferred it to disk... seven years ago.

1466
01:35:55,531 --> 01:35:56,725
- Nat?

1467
01:37:08,972 --> 01:37:12,169
<i>- We take... because it feels good.</i>

1468
01:37:13,176 --> 01:37:15,804
<i>The only difference between you and I</i>

1469
01:37:15,945 --> 01:37:18,812
<i>is that you've gone and done it on videotape.</i>

1470
01:37:19,949 --> 01:37:22,509
<i>Like I was saying, I want the original,</i>

1471
01:37:22,652 --> 01:37:25,917
<i>all the copies and the case file,
by the morning.</i>

1472
01:37:26,622 --> 01:37:28,681
<i>You can have this copy.</i>

1473
01:37:28,825 --> 01:37:32,090
<i>I transferred it to disk... seven years ago.</i>

1474
01:37:35,631 --> 01:37:38,623
- He'll ruin you if you do this.
You know that, Billy.

1475
01:37:39,002 --> 01:37:40,435
- Use it.

1476
01:37:41,337 --> 01:37:43,138
- There's no statute of limitations
on murder.

1477
01:37:43,172 --> 01:37:46,164
If I go with this,
I gotta go with the whole thing.

1478
01:37:46,309 --> 01:37:48,675
Can't cut it down to protect you.
- Not asking you to.

1479
01:37:53,449 --> 01:37:54,916
- You sure?

1480
01:37:55,051 --> 01:37:57,212
- Time to square the debt.

1481
01:38:00,823 --> 01:38:04,259
He was very charming, indeed, yes.

1482
01:38:04,394 --> 01:38:06,385
- Ahem. Ladies and gentlemen,

1483
01:38:06,529 --> 01:38:10,090
unaccustomed as I am to public speaking,
I know you, Sam, you like a debate.

1484
01:38:10,233 --> 01:38:12,531
How did you enjoy that one?
- Masterful.

1485
01:38:12,668 --> 01:38:14,469
- Thank you very, very much.

1486
01:38:14,470 --> 01:38:17,303
Uh, firstly,
I'd like to thank you all for coming.

1487
01:38:17,440 --> 01:38:22,343
This is a room full of my wife and I's
very, very good friends, so thank you.

1488
01:38:22,478 --> 01:38:25,914
A man much smarter than me once said
that politics...

1489
01:38:26,049 --> 01:38:28,347
is the art of the possible.

1490
01:38:28,484 --> 01:38:32,477
Now, this afternoon,
Jack Valliant was ordering stationery.

1491
01:38:33,256 --> 01:38:36,350
Tonight, he's looking for the number
of the bus that hit him.

1492
01:38:36,492 --> 01:38:38,722
He fought a good fight,
but he was boxing shadows.

1493
01:38:38,861 --> 01:38:41,557
He was like Roberto Duran out there.
<i>"No mas, Nicky, no mas.</i>

1494
01:38:41,697 --> 01:38:44,393
Don't hit me no more."
- Mr. Mayor. He says it's urgent.

1495
01:38:44,534 --> 01:38:47,128
- Thank... I'll deal with this.
I... I apol... Don't go anywhere.

1496
01:38:47,270 --> 01:38:49,135
I have a lot of people to thank.

1497
01:38:49,272 --> 01:38:50,762
Yes.
<i>- It's me.</i>

1498
01:38:50,907 --> 01:38:53,637
- Billy.
I didn't think you'd call me so soon.

1499
01:38:53,776 --> 01:38:56,574
<i>- Look out your window now, Mayor.
It's your future.</i>

1500
01:38:56,712 --> 01:38:58,509
- I think your ride's here, Nick.

1501
01:39:05,088 --> 01:39:08,922
- Nicholas Hostetler, you're under arrest
for the murder of Paul Andrews.

1502
01:39:09,058 --> 01:39:10,582
What?

1503
01:39:10,726 --> 01:39:14,162
- You have the right to remain silent.
Anything you say can and will be used

1504
01:39:14,297 --> 01:39:17,095
against you in a court of law.
- Will be used against you, Carl.

1505
01:39:17,233 --> 01:39:18,757
- You have the right to an attorney.

1506
01:39:18,901 --> 01:39:21,392
If you cannot afford one,
one will be provided to you.

1507
01:39:21,537 --> 01:39:24,597
- Attorneys? They'll be pulling
your dental records once I'm done with you.

1508
01:39:24,740 --> 01:39:26,139
- Do you understand these rights

1509
01:39:26,275 --> 01:39:28,607
as I have described them to you?
- I understand you're suicidal.

1510
01:39:28,744 --> 01:39:31,372
You may have forgotten
how you got your job; I have not.

1511
01:39:31,948 --> 01:39:36,214
Do you really think a jury of my peers
in New York City will convict me?

1512
01:39:36,552 --> 01:39:38,747
- I'm just the handcuffs guy.

1513
01:39:41,557 --> 01:39:44,549
- Don't wait up, dear.
- Have I ever?

1514
01:39:49,765 --> 01:39:51,733
- I guess we both misjudged Billy, Mayor.

1515
01:39:51,868 --> 01:39:54,200
Then again, you misjudged the lot of us.

1516
01:39:54,337 --> 01:39:56,237
You thought Billy would roll over,

1517
01:39:56,372 --> 01:39:59,000
you thought Andrews
was sleeping with your wife.

1518
01:39:59,142 --> 01:40:00,769
You thought I wasn't.

1519
01:40:02,145 --> 01:40:04,409
- Mr. Mayor!

1520
01:40:05,581 --> 01:40:08,141
Why did you do it?

1521
01:40:17,160 --> 01:40:19,355
What does this mean for the election?!

1522
01:40:33,009 --> 01:40:36,706
<i>- Councilman, New Yorkers have been put
through quite an ordeal these last few days,</i>

1523
01:40:36,846 --> 01:40:39,474
<i>beginning with the murder of Paul Andrews,
your campaign manager,</i>

1524
01:40:39,615 --> 01:40:41,515
<i>and culminating last night with the arrest</i>

1525
01:40:41,651 --> 01:40:43,278
<i>of Mayor Hostetler
in connection with that crime.</i>

1526
01:40:43,419 --> 01:40:45,353
<i>What do you have to say to New Yorkers</i>

1527
01:40:45,488 --> 01:40:49,015
<i>who quite frankly have lost faith
in their government?</i>

1528
01:40:49,192 --> 01:40:52,491
<i>- Well, days like these
can definitely shake your faith...</i>

1529
01:40:52,628 --> 01:40:55,688
- Rachel, you stayin' out of trouble?
- Hey... Trying.

1530
01:40:55,831 --> 01:40:57,196
- Yeah, I know it.

1531
01:41:00,036 --> 01:41:01,628
Whatever he's drinking.

1532
01:41:09,045 --> 01:41:11,036
Tomorrow's the big day, huh, Billy?

1533
01:41:11,180 --> 01:41:14,445
<i>... believed that whenever
there's a sliver of a choice...</i>

1534
01:41:14,584 --> 01:41:16,848
- Looks like our guy's a lock.

1535
01:41:22,425 --> 01:41:24,154
To Jack Valliant.

1536
01:41:27,230 --> 01:41:28,959
A good man.
- <i>... We need every ounce</i>

1537
01:41:29,098 --> 01:41:32,226
<i>that we can muster
to repair the damage that's been done.</i>

1538
01:41:43,246 --> 01:41:46,443
- I, uh... I got you... this.

1539
01:41:47,216 --> 01:41:51,016
- What is it?
- What does it look like? It's a phone card.

1540
01:41:55,458 --> 01:41:56,891
- Thank you.

1541
01:41:57,893 --> 01:41:59,451
- Every time, Billy.

1542
01:42:07,737 --> 01:42:10,467
- It's okay, Katy. I'll be home real soon.

1543
01:42:11,274 --> 01:42:12,935
- I'll be here.

1544
01:42:13,075 --> 01:42:14,474
- C'mon, Billy.

1545
01:42:15,278 --> 01:42:17,269
We'll take the long way.
