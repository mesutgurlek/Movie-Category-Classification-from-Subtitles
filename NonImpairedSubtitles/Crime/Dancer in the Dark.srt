1
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:27,500
You're sweating.

2
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:30,300
I know. I'm excited though.
I can see it all happening.

3
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:35,500
A little turn...

4
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:37,600
Now side to side.

5
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:40,700
Other people can sing.

6
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,700
Can we talk out here
for a minute?

7
00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:56,700
She's fantastic.

8
00:03:56,700 --> 00:03:57,600
What are you
talking about?

9
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:59,300
I think she sings funny.

10
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:01,400
And her dancing's not
all that great either.

11
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:03,200
That's the first time
she did it, okay?

12
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:07,900
Yeah, but I had
all the kits by then.

13
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:09,100
Because she didn't
take the kettle,

14
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:10,700
so I was stuck.

15
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:12,200
Do you want me to
take the kettle, Samuel?

16
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:14,000
No, I don't.
I just want Kathy

17
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,600
to put it over here.
This is, you know...

18
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:18,400
If you say these words,
and then, boom,

19
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:19,600
you just put
your hands out,

20
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,000
and there they are.
They're there.

21
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:26,700
Please don't
drop the props, Kathy.

22
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:35,500
Wait, wait.

23
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:36,800
Why are you putting it
on her head, though?

24
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:38,500
I'm a little confused.

25
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:40,400
I don't know.
It was, uh...

26
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:42,100
Because she's not
going to pick it up.

27
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:43,900
It looks like
you're trying to...

28
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:45,600
put a hat on her head
or something.

29
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,100
You're fantastic.

30
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:49,200
You just have to listen
to your heart, Cvalda.

31
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:51,000
I don't want you
to call me Cvalda.

32
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,400
Okay, Paul, please.

33
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:53,800
You're Cvalda
to me.

34
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:55,600
Let's do some sound effects.

35
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:22,500
Wait!

36
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:23,800
I told you
no tapping

37
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:25,000
in "The Sound
of Music."

38
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,900
It really needs rhythm.

39
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:28,100
Like drums or something.

40
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:32,300
Everybody's
doing a great job.

41
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:33,800
Really.

42
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:46,700
"L-T-U..."

43
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:51,900
Oh, hello, Selma.
Come here.

44
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:53,700
- Are you ready?
- Yeah, I'm ready.

45
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:56,000
Okay, you know
where to stand.

46
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Yeah.

47
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,500
So let's try
this one.

48
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:02,300
"F-E-Z-T."

49
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:03,800
Maybe
even this one.

50
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:07,400
"T-E-F-P-O..."

51
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:10,200
I think you can work
that machine safely.

52
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:12,200
I'll write a note
to the plant

53
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:13,300
and let them know.

54
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:15,200
Thank you.

55
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:16,200
Bye.

56
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:17,400
Goodbye.

57
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:18,400
Bye.

58
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:19,400
Goodbye.

59
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:49,400
We lost five hours
'cause some idiot

60
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:50,400
broke the machine.

61
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:54,200
Bill's here.

62
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:56,100
So?

63
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:58,200
Well, he's here
with Gene.

64
00:06:58,200 --> 00:07:00,900
Oh, that sounds
like bad news.

65
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:03,300
What are you
going to do?

66
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:06,200
Well, I guess I got
to tell her, don't i?

67
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:13,200
You can't bring
the script to work, Selma.

68
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:15,600
Keep your eyes
on the machine, okay?

69
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:17,100
Yeah.

70
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:19,500
Sure.

71
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:24,100
Bill's here.

72
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:25,400
Bill?

73
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:27,400
He's here with Gene.

74
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:33,000
Not again!

75
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,700
You got to come
right back, okay?

76
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:43,500
Don't be too worried.

77
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:45,100
We're gonna work this out.

78
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:46,400
Here she comes.

79
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:54,700
Why are you
not in school?!

80
00:07:54,700 --> 00:07:56,200
Uhh...

81
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:59,300
When I say so,
you go to school!

82
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:00,500
Do you think I joke?

83
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:02,000
You have to study!

84
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,500
Come on, Selma, stop.

85
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:08,500
We talked about this.
Didn't we talk about it?

86
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:11,600
Hanging out with those
automobile thieves.

87
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:12,300
So what?

88
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:14,000
He's learning.

89
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,400
Selma,
he's learning.

90
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:16,500
Aw, come on.

91
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:19,400
Gene, this is the most
important thing.

92
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:21,200
You have to go to school.

93
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:24,400
Selma, l--I can...

94
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:26,100
drive him back to school
if you like.

95
00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:27,800
Since when was that
your business?

96
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:29,000
What you doing here?

97
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,800
If you need
a ride home--

98
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:32,300
I don't
even punch out

99
00:08:32,300 --> 00:08:34,300
until after
another two hours.

100
00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:36,200
Sometimes you punch out
around this time.

101
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:37,900
I never punch out early!

102
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:39,400
Don't need a dumb...

103
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:42,600
Don't need a ride!

104
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:44,300
In your little head.

105
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:45,400
All right.

106
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:47,600
Come on, Mr. G.
Let's get you to school.

107
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:09,100
Thank you, but l...

108
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:12,500
I'll just...
I'll just ride my bike.

109
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:13,900
Bye, Jeff.

110
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:19,400
She likes you.

111
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:21,800
I'm sure of it.

112
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:23,100
You're sure?

113
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:24,900
Yeah, I'm sure of it.

114
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:29,400
This is my punishment,

115
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:32,100
that you help me with this.

116
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:34,500
And you've got...

117
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:38,300
You've got to make
your bed as well.

118
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:42,600
And you forgot
to wrap up the bread.

119
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:44,100
Two times.

120
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
There's no more of that.

121
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,600
You keep reading.

122
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:51,500
"So long, farewell,

123
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:54,200
auf... wiedersehen...

124
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:57,300
adieu, adieu, adieu,

125
00:09:57,300 --> 00:09:59,200
to yieu and yieu and yieu."

126
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,200
"To yieu...

127
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:04,200
and yieu..."

128
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:06,800
What does that mean,

129
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:07,700
"yieu"?

130
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:11,300
It's your dumb musical.

131
00:10:11,300 --> 00:10:12,500
"And yieu..."

132
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:15,100
It's German.

133
00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:18,600
- You think?
- Mm.

134
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:26,700
You want
some more ketchup?

135
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:28,000
No.

136
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:37,000
Are you tired?

137
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:44,000
Why--why should you...

138
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,100
always ask me so...

139
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:48,400
so stupid questions?

140
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:53,600
Shall I show you
my step?

141
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:08,200
Oh, hi.
Hi, Gene.

142
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:09,900
How's the dancing?

143
00:11:09,900 --> 00:11:12,000
Oh... good.

144
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,700
- Yeah?
- Yeah, Yeah.

145
00:11:13,700 --> 00:11:16,000
You want to come over
to me and Bill's place

146
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,200
and listen
to some music?

147
00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:21,300
That--that
would be lovely.

148
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:22,500
But... we couldn't.

149
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:24,400
Come on.
Come on.

150
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:26,800
Yeah... uh...

151
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:28,600
Let's go.
Come on.

152
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,300
You should ask Bill
about his money.

153
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:42,400
Linda likes it when
we talk about that.

154
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:46,600
You're doing
a very nice job with these.

155
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:48,900
How about that?

156
00:11:48,900 --> 00:11:50,500
You have to be
very careful

157
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:52,400
not to bend
the card.

158
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:53,400
Uh-huh.

159
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:56,700
Otherwise I don't
get paid for it.

160
00:11:56,700 --> 00:11:58,200
No.

161
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:00,000
That's fair,
because...

162
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,900
the people in the shops
would never want to buy it

163
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:04,100
if it's bent.

164
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:05,700
You wouldn't buy it
if it was bent.

165
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:06,700
That's true,
I wouldn't.

166
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:08,400
Wouldn't buy anything
if it was bent.

167
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:18,600
In Czechoslovakia,

168
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:19,800
I saw a film,

169
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:23,200
and they were eating candy
from a tin

170
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:24,100
just like this.

171
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:25,900
No.

172
00:12:25,900 --> 00:12:27,700
I thought to myself...

173
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:30,600
how wonderful it must be

174
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:33,100
in the United States.

175
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:34,500
Yeah?

176
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:36,300
You think my house
looks like a movie?

177
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:38,200
Oh, our house
looks like a movie.

178
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:40,000
And you look
like a movie star.

179
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:44,300
Bill gives me
a lot of money.

180
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:45,500
You know?

181
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:46,700
I know.

182
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:48,500
Of course, it's all
that money you inherited,

183
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:50,700
isn't it, Bill?

184
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:51,900
That's right.

185
00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:56,600
Hey, Selma...

186
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:58,200
Take the rest
with you.

187
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:00,800
Are you sure?

188
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:02,400
Go on.

189
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:16,200
Hello.

190
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:18,300
Good morning.

191
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:19,700
I've got the rent.

192
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:21,100
Oh.

193
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:23,000
You always pay
right on time.

194
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,400
Don't worry about Gene.
I'll get him off to school,

195
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:26,400
okay?

196
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:27,300
Thank you.

197
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:28,600
Thanks very much.

198
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:31,700
Remember your bag.

199
00:14:31,700 --> 00:14:32,900
Bye-bye.

200
00:14:32,900 --> 00:14:34,000
Bye.

201
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:38,200
I think you're always
so serious, Kathy.

202
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:40,200
Aw... again we start.

203
00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:44,000
I don't think inside
you're serious at all.

204
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,800
I don't know.

205
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:47,400
Not always.

206
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:48,400
Cvalda.

207
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:50,400
Why do you
call me that?

208
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:52,900
It's like...
someone who's...

209
00:14:54,700 --> 00:14:57,200
I don't know,
just big and happy.

210
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:58,700
I am not that big.

211
00:14:58,700 --> 00:15:01,100
Happy?
I don't know.

212
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:03,100
Just need someone
to pull it out.

213
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:10,800
Beautiful eyes.

214
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:11,800
Yeah.

215
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:13,800
But he's not
real happy, is he?

216
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:17,200
How is she doing?

217
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:20,000
It's when she
cannot keep up,

218
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,700
and she's going to faint.

219
00:15:22,700 --> 00:15:23,800
Ah, she fainted.

220
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:25,200
Please be quiet.

221
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:26,300
Oh, give us a break.

222
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:27,600
She doesn't see
that well.

223
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:29,300
I paid good money
to see this film.

224
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:30,400
Well, so did she.

225
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,400
I love it
when they dance.

226
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:37,200
For Pete's sake,
it's a musical.

227
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:38,600
Of course they're dancing!

228
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:39,500
We know that!

229
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:40,700
Oh, you're so smart.

230
00:15:40,700 --> 00:15:42,000
- Yes.
- Oh.

231
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
I think you made
friends, Kathy.

232
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:53,200
Stop!

233
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:04,800
So, what'd she say?

234
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:05,800
What?

235
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:07,200
What did she say?

236
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:09,300
She didn't say
anything.

237
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:11,100
Are you trying to
tell me something?

238
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:14,100
It's about the bike.

239
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:15,400
The bike?

240
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:18,100
Mm, the bike.

241
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:19,500
Oh, um, l--I--

242
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:21,800
I cannot
give Gene a bike.

243
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:23,000
Is this his idea?

244
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,700
No, it's not his idea.

245
00:16:24,700 --> 00:16:25,600
Gene?

246
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:26,900
Yeah?

247
00:16:26,900 --> 00:16:29,000
Did you ask them
to come over?

248
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,500
No.

249
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:32,000
No, he didn't.
It doesn't...

250
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,300
He doesn't know anything,
Selma. Frankly.

251
00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:36,200
Why, have I
done something?

252
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:37,300
No.

253
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:38,600
I haven't got
the money.

254
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:41,800
But... I'm almost
the only kid in class

255
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:43,300
who doesn't have
a bike.

256
00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:47,000
I even know a boy
who's got a scooter.

257
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,200
You know I haven't got
any money.

258
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:51,700
The only extra money I got

259
00:16:51,700 --> 00:16:53,600
the times I managed
to save up,

260
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:54,700
I send it...

261
00:16:54,700 --> 00:16:55,800
to Grandpa.

262
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:57,100
- Come have a look.
- I'm not gonna get you

263
00:16:57,100 --> 00:16:58,100
expensive things.

264
00:16:58,100 --> 00:16:59,300
Your mother
is only teasing.

265
00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:01,500
Look what she's
brought for you!

266
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:03,400
It's a bike!

267
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:04,400
We cannot
accept that.

268
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:06,100
Selma, it was second-hand.

269
00:17:06,100 --> 00:17:08,400
I can't give him
any expensive things.

270
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:09,600
- Yeah, but--
- I can't even give it

271
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:11,000
for his birthday.

272
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,900
- Yeah, but, well--
- He's just gonna accept that.

273
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:14,400
I'm not that sort of mom.

274
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:15,800
I'm--I'm--

275
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:19,200
I'm just not that kind
of mother, Gene. I...

276
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:20,700
Can't you be

277
00:17:20,700 --> 00:17:22,700
that kind
of a mother?

278
00:17:22,700 --> 00:17:24,600
It's not exactly a scooter.

279
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:27,600
Hmm... We'll see.

280
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:28,900
We'll see.

281
00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:30,000
Careful!

282
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,900
Don't ride
too fast.

283
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:36,100
Hey, gene,
bring it over here.

284
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:41,600
He looks very happy,
doesn't he?

285
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:42,600
He does look happy.

286
00:17:43,900 --> 00:17:45,500
Here he comes again.

287
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:46,500
Attention!

288
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:47,800
Bring it over here.

289
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:49,000
Mom...

290
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,800
Okay.

291
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:53,700
Did you hear
what she said?

292
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:56,500
- She say okay?
- Yeah!

293
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:57,900
Did you say okay?

294
00:17:57,900 --> 00:17:59,400
Yeah.

295
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:02,100
Promise to go to school.

296
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:04,900
Yes, yes.

297
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:06,500
Every day.
On time.

298
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:08,800
I didn't know you
were such a good biker.

299
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:12,000
Rust and women
are the same.

300
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,100
"Rust and women
are the same"?

301
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:15,700
They are the same.

302
00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:16,900
What is it?

303
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:18,500
Your fat Yeah. id that?

304
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:20,100
Some joke...

305
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:22,000
I don't know
what it meant.

306
00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:28,400
Look at that.
Oh, ho...

307
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:31,300
You're so kind.
Look at me.

308
00:18:31,300 --> 00:18:33,300
He did all the work,
you know that.

309
00:18:33,300 --> 00:18:35,300
He's really good.

310
00:18:35,300 --> 00:18:37,300
Thank you, Jeff!

311
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:39,700
You're welcome.

312
00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:48,600
Come in.

313
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:51,000
Something up, Bill?

314
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:54,400
No, no, I just couldn't
sleep, that's all.

315
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:04,100
I have no money.

316
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:07,400
All the money
that I inherited is...

317
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:09,000
It's gone.

318
00:19:13,300 --> 00:19:15,000
And Linda...

319
00:19:16,700 --> 00:19:19,100
Linda...

320
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:22,500
She spends and spends.

321
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:27,900
And my salary's
nowhere near enough.

322
00:19:28,900 --> 00:19:31,000
I can't say no to her.

323
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:34,900
The bank's gonna
repossess the house...

324
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:40,000
because I'm so far behind
on the payments.

325
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:44,000
And I'm gonna lose Linda.

326
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,700
I know it.

327
00:19:46,700 --> 00:19:48,100
I know I am.

328
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:54,400
She loves you, Bill.

329
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:01,400
Oh, don't cry.

330
00:20:07,900 --> 00:20:09,900
I shouldn't
have told you.

331
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:11,000
Don't worry.

332
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,700
- Shouldn't have told you.
- It's okay.

333
00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:14,000
Don't worry.

334
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,500
No, I think you've
got enough... stuff.

335
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:16,800
Would it make you
feel better

336
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:18,800
if I told you
a secret?

337
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:20,800
What secret
could you tell me?

338
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:29,300
I'm going blind.

339
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,100
Not yet, but...

340
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:39,500
Soon.

341
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:44,800
Maybe sometime
this year.

342
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:55,800
Blind...

343
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:03,400
It's not as bad
as it sounds.

344
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,700
It's, uh...

345
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:09,000
It's a family thing.

346
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:14,700
But, blind?

347
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:16,800
I've always known it.

348
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:19,800
From... when I was
a little girl,

349
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:20,700
I knew.

350
00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:27,200
And you're okay?

351
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:31,200
Well, I came to America

352
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:33,000
because in America,

353
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,500
they can give Gene
an operation.

354
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:36,400
You know?

355
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:38,700
Gene?

356
00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:40,900
He doesn't know
about it.

357
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:44,700
You... you
mustn't tell him,

358
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:47,200
because then
it could get worse.

359
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:49,200
I just have to save up
money, you know,

360
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:51,200
enough money to...

361
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:55,200
Oh, I almost got it.

362
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:57,100
To, uh...

363
00:21:57,100 --> 00:21:59,200
For the operation.

364
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:02,500
They can operate on Gene
when he turns 1 3.

365
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:04,800
And you made up that story
about your father?

366
00:22:06,100 --> 00:22:08,200
Huh.

367
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:10,100
I never had a father.

368
00:22:10,100 --> 00:22:12,800
I made up
his name, too.

369
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,800
And that's why you
put in all these hours

370
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:19,900
and do all these pins
and do everything you do.

371
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:22,600
For him.

372
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:24,500
For his operation.

373
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:31,500
Well, it is my fault.

374
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:33,400
I guess...

375
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:35,400
How is it your fault?

376
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:43,500
Because l...
I knew he would...

377
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:46,000
he would have
bad eyes like me.

378
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:49,600
But I had him...

379
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:51,100
all the same.

380
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:56,300
You're very strong.

381
00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:01,100
I'm not strong.

382
00:23:01,100 --> 00:23:02,800
I've got
little games I play

383
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:04,400
when it goes really hard.

384
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,200
When I'm working
in the factory...

385
00:23:10,900 --> 00:23:14,500
and the machines,
they make these...

386
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:16,200
rhythms...

387
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:21,700
And I just start dreaming,

388
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:23,900
and it all becomes music.

389
00:23:23,900 --> 00:23:25,000
But you like movies,
don't you?

390
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,000
- I love the movies.
- Yeah?

391
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
I just love
the musicals.

392
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,400
Oh, when they're
all tap dancing?

393
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:33,300
All of them
tap dancing,

394
00:23:33,300 --> 00:23:35,700
all of them, this
huge, long line.

395
00:23:35,700 --> 00:23:37,200
I... wouldn't you
like to be

396
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:38,500
in that big,
long line?

397
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:41,300
Yeah.

398
00:23:41,300 --> 00:23:42,500
Kicking your feet
up there?

399
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:43,500
Yeah.

400
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:45,500
When they're,
like, spiraling up

401
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:48,500
the huge,
enormous wedding cakes

402
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:49,700
to the top?

403
00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:50,700
Yeah.

404
00:23:50,700 --> 00:23:51,900
But isn't that annoying

405
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:54,000
when they do the last song
in the films, though?

406
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,100
Why?

407
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:57,600
Because you just know
when it goes really big,

408
00:23:57,600 --> 00:24:01,000
and the camera goes,
like, out of the roof,

409
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,900
and you just know
it's gonna end.

410
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:04,800
I hate that.

411
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:06,100
I really hate that.

412
00:24:06,100 --> 00:24:08,900
I used to cheat on that
when I was a little girl

413
00:24:08,900 --> 00:24:11,000
back in Czechoslovakia.

414
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,700
I would leave the cinema

415
00:24:13,700 --> 00:24:16,700
just after
the next to last song,

416
00:24:16,700 --> 00:24:19,800
and the film would
just go on forever.

417
00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:23,300
It's lovely, isn't it?

418
00:24:23,300 --> 00:24:24,700
That is lovely.

419
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:28,100
Selma...

420
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:30,300
Yeah?

421
00:24:30,300 --> 00:24:32,300
Thank you for
telling me your secret.

422
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,800
Thanks for
telling me yours.

423
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,200
Mum's the word, right?

424
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:43,700
"Mum"?

425
00:24:43,700 --> 00:24:45,200
We don't tell anybody?

426
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:47,300
Oh, yes.

427
00:24:47,300 --> 00:24:48,800
I won't tell
anyone.

428
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:52,100
Goodbye.

429
00:24:52,100 --> 00:24:52,800
Goodbye.

430
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:13,000
Oh, thank you.

431
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,100
So, can I get you
another?

432
00:25:15,100 --> 00:25:17,300
Yeah, sure.

433
00:25:17,300 --> 00:25:18,900
How about a big one?

434
00:25:18,900 --> 00:25:21,200
How many is there
in a big one?

435
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:22,400
1 0,000.

436
00:25:24,100 --> 00:25:25,600
I'll have a big one.

437
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:31,100
What's this
guy's name again?

438
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:34,200
Who?

439
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:35,600
The old man,
your old man,

440
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:37,900
the guy we're carding
these pins for.

441
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:41,400
Her father?

442
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:43,900
I know.
Oldrich.

443
00:25:43,900 --> 00:25:44,800
Right?

444
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:46,100
Yeah.

445
00:25:46,100 --> 00:25:48,400
Oldrich Novy.

446
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:50,800
He used to dance
in Prague.

447
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:52,100
You commies
make a big deal

448
00:25:52,100 --> 00:25:53,500
out of sharing
everything.

449
00:25:53,500 --> 00:25:55,700
Yeah.

450
00:25:55,700 --> 00:25:57,700
It's--It's
a good thing.

451
00:25:57,700 --> 00:25:59,600
What are you doing
here if, uh...

452
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:01,300
Czechoslovakia's
so much better

453
00:26:01,300 --> 00:26:02,800
than the U.S. of A?

454
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:41,600
No, Selma, no!

455
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:43,400
There are
two plates.

456
00:26:46,700 --> 00:26:48,200
It's all right.

457
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,200
You know what happens

458
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:53,900
when you put two plates
in, don't you?

459
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:59,600
Well, she didn't do it.
I mean, it didn't happen--

460
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:00,700
You destroy
the tool.

461
00:27:02,100 --> 00:27:03,500
It takes
a whole day

462
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:04,500
to mend.

463
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:06,500
Never two plates,
Selma, never!

464
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:08,200
You cheated the doctor.

465
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:10,300
You shouldn't be working
at the press at all.

466
00:27:10,300 --> 00:27:12,600
I mean, how dare you!
Just how much can you see?

467
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:14,400
I could do my job
with my eyes closed.

468
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:15,600
So could you.

469
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:16,600
No.

470
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:19,500
It's just because
I was daydreaming.

471
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:20,600
Daydreaming?

472
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:22,600
Dreaming about what?

473
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:23,900
Oh, I just
hear music.

474
00:27:23,900 --> 00:27:26,000
Come on. I mean,
Selma, music?

475
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,100
You could also
cut off your hand

476
00:27:27,100 --> 00:27:28,700
just like that.
You have to watch out

477
00:27:28,700 --> 00:27:29,900
every second.

478
00:27:29,900 --> 00:27:31,800
Promise me
you'll stay awake.

479
00:27:33,100 --> 00:27:35,500
I--I promise I will
stop daydreaming.

480
00:27:35,500 --> 00:27:37,000
Aw, you're not--
you repeat,

481
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,200
but you don't
even listen to me.

482
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:40,000
I don't know why
I bother that much.

483
00:27:42,500 --> 00:27:44,900
Hi, Selma.

484
00:27:44,900 --> 00:27:46,100
If you're not
going with Kathy,

485
00:27:46,100 --> 00:27:48,100
can I give you
a lift?

486
00:27:48,100 --> 00:27:50,400
I don't want
a boyfriend.

487
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:52,300
I--I told you.

488
00:27:53,300 --> 00:27:54,500
Yeah.

489
00:27:54,500 --> 00:27:56,200
You're a really
nice guy, Jeff,

490
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:57,200
but...

491
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:59,800
I just don't have time
for a boyfriend.

492
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:03,600
Not right now.

493
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:06,000
I know.

494
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:09,400
If I wanted a boyfriend,
it would be you, Jeff.

495
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:11,000
I just don't want one
right now.

496
00:28:17,300 --> 00:28:18,400
All right.

497
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:19,700
No problem, you know,

498
00:28:19,700 --> 00:28:21,700
on the back,
to have the bike there.

499
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:24,200
Yeah.

500
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:30,700
Bye, Jeff.

501
00:28:30,700 --> 00:28:33,200
I don't think it's
very safe, you know,

502
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:36,700
to ride a bike
wearing glasses and all.

503
00:28:36,700 --> 00:28:38,100
- Selma?
- Bye, jeff.

504
00:28:38,100 --> 00:28:39,400
Huh?

505
00:28:47,300 --> 00:28:48,600
Are you okay?

506
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,500
Yeah, I'm fine.

507
00:28:52,900 --> 00:28:53,900
Hello, Selm.

508
00:28:53,900 --> 00:28:55,400
Hi, Bill.

509
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:56,900
Headed home?

510
00:28:56,900 --> 00:28:58,300
Uh, yes.

511
00:28:58,300 --> 00:29:00,100
Want to put it
in the back?

512
00:29:00,100 --> 00:29:02,500
Oh, that would be
lovely. Yes, please.

513
00:29:02,500 --> 00:29:03,400
Hi, Jeff.

514
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:05,300
Hey. Did you
see the truck?

515
00:29:05,300 --> 00:29:07,200
No?

516
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:08,200
They're blind,

517
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:11,400
driving
like crazy.

518
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:13,300
He's what?

519
00:29:13,300 --> 00:29:15,700
He's driving
like crazy.

520
00:29:19,300 --> 00:29:20,700
Getting dirty.

521
00:29:20,700 --> 00:29:22,400
That's all right.

522
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:26,000
Thank you.

523
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,100
Bye, Jeff.

524
00:29:27,100 --> 00:29:28,700
Bye.

525
00:29:28,700 --> 00:29:30,000
Thank you, Bill.

526
00:29:33,500 --> 00:29:35,700
- Okay?
- Okay, yeah.

527
00:29:40,900 --> 00:29:42,600
If I could just make
the next payment,

528
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:44,700
I'd have
a bit more time.

529
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:46,600
Yeah.

530
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:49,000
All I need is a loan.

531
00:29:54,100 --> 00:29:55,500
It'd just be a month.

532
00:29:57,600 --> 00:29:59,200
This money is Gene's.

533
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:03,900
I'm sorry, Bill.

534
00:30:03,900 --> 00:30:05,700
That's all right.
I shouldn't have asked.

535
00:30:05,700 --> 00:30:07,400
Oh, you had to.
Don't worry,

536
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:08,300
there's no harm
in asking.

537
00:30:08,300 --> 00:30:09,400
No, no, I
shouldn't have asked.

538
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:11,600
Linda wants new couches.

539
00:30:18,500 --> 00:30:20,700
I could always
shoot myself.

540
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:24,700
You mustn't say
things like that.

541
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:29,000
It's--
Make things easier.

542
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:33,500
- You know that, Bill.
- Aw, Selma.

543
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:35,100
You mustn't say
things like that.

544
00:30:35,100 --> 00:30:36,500
Selma, I'm kidding.

545
00:30:42,900 --> 00:30:46,100
Hi, Selma.
Come on in.

546
00:30:46,100 --> 00:30:47,200
Hi, Gene.

547
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:48,400
Good morning.

548
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:49,000
Hi.

549
00:30:59,100 --> 00:31:01,700
How are you?

550
00:31:01,700 --> 00:31:02,900
Fine, thank you.

551
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:09,400
Can I see the gun?

552
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:11,200
Yeah, go on, sure.

553
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:16,000
- He's got a gun?
- Sure.

554
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,600
He's a police officer.

555
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:20,200
I just didn't know
he would keep it here,

556
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:21,300
in the house.

557
00:31:21,300 --> 00:31:23,200
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, yeah.

558
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:25,600
He keeps it
in his desk.

559
00:31:33,900 --> 00:31:36,100
Maybe I should
pay more rent.

560
00:31:36,100 --> 00:31:37,600
It's been the same

561
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:39,500
for the whole period
I've been here.

562
00:31:39,500 --> 00:31:42,000
No, Selma,
I won't hear it.

563
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,800
You keep your money.
You need it more

564
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:44,400
than we do.

565
00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:34,600
Two boxes?

566
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:36,200
Did you decide
you are going to do

567
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:38,000
two boxes at
the same time now?

568
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,000
Yeah.

569
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,800
Selma...
1 0:00 then?

570
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:43,000
1 0:00.

571
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:46,400
What happens
at 1 0:00?

572
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:49,300
I'm--I'm gonna do
the night shift.

573
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:50,800
The night shift?

574
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:52,000
You can hardly see
well enough

575
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:53,900
to do your own shift.

576
00:32:53,900 --> 00:32:55,500
It suits me fine.

577
00:32:55,500 --> 00:32:58,100
It's just after
drama class.

578
00:32:58,100 --> 00:32:59,500
You are going
to do that, too?

579
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,800
I've had my fill
of you, Selma.

580
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:05,000
You do
what you want.

581
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:06,800
Go ahead,
break your neck.

582
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:08,000
Do your night shift,

583
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,200
but don't think
for one second

584
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:11,500
I'm going to come
and rescue you.

585
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:19,200
Selma?

586
00:33:21,700 --> 00:33:24,000
Kathy split already.

587
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,000
I'm not looking
for Kathy.

588
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,000
I was looking
for you.

589
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:31,900
I just have to go to
drama rehearsal.

590
00:33:31,900 --> 00:33:33,500
So what do you say?

591
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:36,100
You can always
ride your bike.

592
00:33:36,100 --> 00:33:38,900
You have it over there.

593
00:33:38,900 --> 00:33:40,200
I left it at home.

594
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:42,700
I thought it'd be
quicker if I walked.

595
00:33:42,700 --> 00:33:44,900
How do you reckon that?

596
00:33:44,900 --> 00:33:48,100
I just walk along
the railroad tracks.

597
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:51,600
It's a...

598
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:52,900
shortcut.

599
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:15,200
Look, I don't understand.
In musicals...

600
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:18,600
why do they start to sing
and dance all of a sudden?

601
00:34:19,700 --> 00:34:24,800
I mean, I don't suddenly
start... to sing and dance.

602
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:25,700
No...

603
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:30,400
You're right, Jeff.
You don't.

604
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:34,400
The last thing on the list
is the bake sale.

605
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:36,200
Two sundays away.

606
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,800
Hi, Selma.
Come on in, come on in.

607
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:43,200
I'm gonna introduce you
to your understudy.

608
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:44,900
My understudy?

609
00:34:44,900 --> 00:34:45,900
Yeah.

610
00:34:45,900 --> 00:34:48,200
This girl Suzan,
who boris knows,

611
00:34:48,200 --> 00:34:51,000
is a good singer.
She's a good dancer.

612
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:52,600
She'll learn
your part, too,

613
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:55,400
because, say,
you get a cold,

614
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:57,100
and...

615
00:34:57,100 --> 00:34:58,200
you can't do it,

616
00:34:58,200 --> 00:35:01,100
then the show
doesn't have to stop.

617
00:35:01,100 --> 00:35:02,100
Okay?

618
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:05,100
Suzan, Selma.
Selma, Suzan.

619
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:09,700
Could you take off
your glasses?

620
00:35:14,900 --> 00:35:16,400
I think
we'll do the part

621
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:18,000
without glasses.

622
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,400
Next sunday,
you will see

623
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:22,100
both Marias.

624
00:35:22,100 --> 00:35:23,900
I mean, Selma will
do the role, really,

625
00:35:23,900 --> 00:35:26,100
but... i'll have you
read part of it too.

626
00:35:26,100 --> 00:35:27,100
All right?

627
00:35:28,900 --> 00:35:30,200
It's your first time
on the night shift,

628
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:31,100
right?

629
00:35:31,100 --> 00:35:32,800
While this
is being pressed,

630
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:34,200
you'll be cutting
on the other machine.

631
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:36,400
That means
you'll be in charge

632
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:39,200
of two machines.

633
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:43,000
You have to beat Sarah
over there, right?

634
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:44,800
This pallet must
never be empty.

635
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:46,800
Is it always
so dark in here?

636
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:47,800
What?

637
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:49,000
Is it always
so dark in here?

638
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:50,700
It's exactly the same
as the daytime.

639
00:35:50,700 --> 00:35:51,800
Oh.
Okay.

640
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:53,600
The only thing is you have
to work a little faster.

641
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:54,800
That's what
you're paid for, right?

642
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:55,800
- Okay.
- Okay?

643
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:56,800
Thank you.

644
00:36:18,300 --> 00:36:20,300
- Excuse me.
- Yeah?

645
00:36:20,300 --> 00:36:21,400
You have to work
a little, you know,

646
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:22,700
a little faster
than this.

647
00:36:22,700 --> 00:36:23,700
Okay.

648
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:49,300
What are you
doing here?

649
00:36:49,300 --> 00:36:50,600
What do you think?

650
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:58,900
I didn't put you down for
the night shift, Kathy.

651
00:36:58,900 --> 00:37:00,300
Run along, Norman.

652
00:37:00,300 --> 00:37:02,300
I'm on my own time now.

653
00:37:02,300 --> 00:37:04,400
How I spend it
is my own business.

654
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:06,000
'Night, ladies!

655
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:07,000
Good night!

656
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:10,600
Faster.

657
00:37:10,600 --> 00:37:11,900
A little faster.

658
00:37:11,900 --> 00:37:14,400
I like it better
when you dance.

659
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:16,800
You should dance
more... Cvalda.

660
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:19,400
I will dance
when there is music.

661
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:29,100
It's music.

662
00:38:29,100 --> 00:38:30,700
Now dance.

663
00:41:34,600 --> 00:41:35,800
Selma!

664
00:41:36,700 --> 00:41:38,000
Stop that,
you've cut yourself!

665
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:39,500
Get away from
the machine!

666
00:41:39,500 --> 00:41:40,800
Henry!

667
00:41:48,200 --> 00:41:50,500
Oh, Jeff is here.

668
00:41:52,200 --> 00:41:53,800
Hello, Jeff.

669
00:41:53,800 --> 00:41:54,900
Hi, Kathy.

670
00:41:54,900 --> 00:41:56,500
Do you live here?

671
00:41:58,300 --> 00:42:00,400
Thought she might
say yes to a ride

672
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:02,200
when it's
this late.

673
00:42:02,200 --> 00:42:04,100
M-maybe Kathy...

674
00:42:04,100 --> 00:42:05,500
wants a ride.

675
00:42:05,500 --> 00:42:07,400
No, it's all right.

676
00:42:08,500 --> 00:42:10,300
What's that,
with your hand?

677
00:42:10,300 --> 00:42:12,000
She cut her...

678
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:13,300
Cut my finger.

679
00:42:13,300 --> 00:42:15,300
Yeah. It's going
to be all right.

680
00:42:15,300 --> 00:42:17,700
The plates are sharp.

681
00:42:17,700 --> 00:42:18,600
Goodnight.

682
00:42:18,600 --> 00:42:19,600
Careful.

683
00:43:16,600 --> 00:43:19,100
I think I found
a solution to our problem.

684
00:43:21,700 --> 00:43:24,200
That makes me
really happy.

685
00:43:24,200 --> 00:43:27,100
It's nothing special...

686
00:43:27,100 --> 00:43:29,200
But I've made up my mind.
I'm gonna tell Linda,

687
00:43:29,200 --> 00:43:30,700
and, uh...

688
00:43:34,900 --> 00:43:37,500
I mean, after all,
she loves me, and...

689
00:43:41,800 --> 00:43:43,500
We'll just
work it out together.

690
00:43:44,500 --> 00:43:47,300
That sounds like
a really good idea, Bill.

691
00:43:55,100 --> 00:43:57,300
I'm sorry, I'll
let you get to bed.

692
00:43:57,300 --> 00:43:58,900
I guess I'm kinda tired.

693
00:44:00,100 --> 00:44:01,500
Thanks, Bill.

694
00:44:01,500 --> 00:44:02,600
Good night, Selma.

695
00:44:02,600 --> 00:44:03,900
Good night, Bill.

696
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:15,700
Bill?

697
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:37,900
What's happening now?

698
00:45:59,800 --> 00:46:01,600
Here we go.
Selma, are you ready?

699
00:46:10,500 --> 00:46:11,700
And...

700
00:46:11,700 --> 00:46:12,600
You're on.

701
00:46:17,100 --> 00:46:19,200
Cut. Cut, stop.

702
00:46:19,200 --> 00:46:21,300
Stop, please.

703
00:46:21,300 --> 00:46:23,400
This is Selma's entrance, okay?

704
00:46:23,400 --> 00:46:25,000
Yeah?

705
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:27,800
Okay, Paul, please.

706
00:46:30,700 --> 00:46:32,900
How far
do you think it is?

707
00:46:32,900 --> 00:46:34,400
I don't know.

708
00:46:39,900 --> 00:46:40,900
And...

709
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:46,200
Kathy, what
are you doing?

710
00:46:46,200 --> 00:46:48,100
This is
Maria's entrance.

711
00:46:48,100 --> 00:46:49,600
Yes.
I'm sorry.

712
00:46:49,600 --> 00:46:50,800
My mistake.

713
00:46:50,800 --> 00:46:51,900
Please, please!

714
00:46:51,900 --> 00:46:52,900
I don't have
all night!

715
00:46:52,900 --> 00:46:53,900
Six steps.

716
00:46:53,900 --> 00:46:55,800
Let's take this
a little more seriously.

717
00:47:05,400 --> 00:47:06,600
Good!

718
00:47:06,600 --> 00:47:08,900
Okay, I'm thinking
maybe, Selma...

719
00:47:08,900 --> 00:47:11,400
You could take a little
sort of circle around Boris

720
00:47:11,400 --> 00:47:12,900
on this next part,

721
00:47:12,900 --> 00:47:16,200
unless you have something else
you wanna suggest.

722
00:47:16,200 --> 00:47:18,500
I'm open.

723
00:47:18,500 --> 00:47:20,300
Okay?

724
00:47:20,300 --> 00:47:21,600
Samuel.

725
00:47:21,600 --> 00:47:23,500
Yes?

726
00:47:23,500 --> 00:47:24,800
I need to
talk to you.

727
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:27,300
Oh, Selma, please, if
it's about the drummer,

728
00:47:27,300 --> 00:47:28,900
I have been looking
everywhere for a drummer--

729
00:47:28,900 --> 00:47:30,900
It's not
about the drummer.

730
00:47:30,900 --> 00:47:32,300
It's not
about the drummer.

731
00:47:36,700 --> 00:47:39,000
Um... just a quick word.

732
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:40,800
Do you wanna
go outside?

733
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:41,800
Yup.

734
00:47:41,800 --> 00:47:42,800
Okay.

735
00:47:51,900 --> 00:47:55,000
I--I'm not
gonna play Maria.

736
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:56,700
What?

737
00:47:57,900 --> 00:48:00,100
My heart just
isn't in this...

738
00:48:00,100 --> 00:48:02,400
Like, I shouldn't
be wasting my time

739
00:48:02,400 --> 00:48:03,800
on something...

740
00:48:03,800 --> 00:48:06,600
that isn't...
that important really.

741
00:48:09,500 --> 00:48:12,400
I've been watching Suzan,
and she's...

742
00:48:12,400 --> 00:48:13,500
She's great.

743
00:48:13,500 --> 00:48:15,900
She's... She's very--

744
00:48:15,900 --> 00:48:17,700
She's a much better dancer
than I am.

745
00:48:17,700 --> 00:48:18,700
Terrific.

746
00:48:18,700 --> 00:48:21,500
Suzan's terrific.
I'm not denying that,

747
00:48:21,500 --> 00:48:24,200
but you--I thought
you lived for musicals.

748
00:48:24,200 --> 00:48:26,600
So you've been pretending
the whole time?

749
00:48:26,600 --> 00:48:28,600
Yes.

750
00:48:28,600 --> 00:48:31,400
I've just been pretending.

751
00:48:31,400 --> 00:48:33,300
I don't know what else
I could do with you.

752
00:48:33,300 --> 00:48:34,600
I've got everything
cast right now.

753
00:48:34,600 --> 00:48:36,500
Yeah.

754
00:48:36,500 --> 00:48:38,900
The only part that's left
is the old nun

755
00:48:38,900 --> 00:48:41,200
who lets maria out
of the convent gate.

756
00:48:41,200 --> 00:48:42,400
I don't think
you'd want that part.

757
00:48:42,400 --> 00:48:45,600
There's no dancing
in that.

758
00:48:45,600 --> 00:48:47,400
She's
quite serious then?

759
00:48:47,400 --> 00:48:48,800
She's serious.

760
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:50,800
It's important
for the part.

761
00:48:50,800 --> 00:48:52,600
Okay. I'm not
dancing really.

762
00:48:53,800 --> 00:48:55,400
No.

763
00:48:55,400 --> 00:48:58,300
I could put a little bit
of dancing in there.

764
00:48:58,300 --> 00:48:59,800
You think so?

765
00:48:59,800 --> 00:49:03,200
It--I didn't
have it in mind.

766
00:49:03,200 --> 00:49:05,900
You can have
your tapping.

767
00:49:05,900 --> 00:49:08,700
She could be just
a little... humorous

768
00:49:08,700 --> 00:49:10,300
once in a while...

769
00:49:10,300 --> 00:49:11,900
even though
she's a nun.

770
00:49:14,800 --> 00:49:16,800
You'll always be
my perfect Maria.

771
00:49:19,600 --> 00:49:22,200
Where are all
the hairpins today?

772
00:49:22,200 --> 00:49:23,900
I left them at home.

773
00:49:23,900 --> 00:49:26,500
And she won't be
playing Maria.

774
00:49:26,500 --> 00:49:28,400
What do you reckon
I'm gonna do

775
00:49:28,400 --> 00:49:29,700
if I can't bawl you out
for learning your lines

776
00:49:29,700 --> 00:49:30,900
on company time?

777
00:49:32,200 --> 00:49:34,000
One...two...

778
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:35,200
Three!

779
00:49:37,900 --> 00:49:39,900
What kind of a joke
is that?

780
00:49:39,900 --> 00:49:40,800
Well, she's beating me.

781
00:49:40,800 --> 00:49:42,900
I need a word with you.

782
00:49:42,900 --> 00:49:44,400
We're talking
right now.

783
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:46,100
All right...

784
00:49:46,100 --> 00:49:47,400
Come on.

785
00:49:55,600 --> 00:49:57,000
Please sit down.

786
00:49:59,800 --> 00:50:02,400
We were off
for the whole day.

787
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:04,300
Everything stops when
the machine breaks.

788
00:50:04,300 --> 00:50:05,500
You know that.

789
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:10,100
I--I can do my job
just fine...

790
00:50:10,100 --> 00:50:13,400
if I stick
to the day shift.

791
00:50:13,400 --> 00:50:15,500
This won't happen again.

792
00:50:15,500 --> 00:50:18,700
Look, I daydream
too much.

793
00:50:18,700 --> 00:50:21,400
I--I decided to quit.

794
00:50:23,500 --> 00:50:24,600
And...

795
00:50:26,300 --> 00:50:29,000
And I guess,
then l--I forgot.

796
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:34,400
I've been ordered
to let you go, Selma.

797
00:50:41,400 --> 00:50:42,900
You're not
gonna have to pay

798
00:50:42,900 --> 00:50:44,400
for the machine
you broke.

799
00:50:44,400 --> 00:50:46,600
I got them
to agree to that.

800
00:50:46,600 --> 00:50:48,100
Uh, thanks, Norman.

801
00:50:52,500 --> 00:50:55,800
This is your salary.

802
00:50:57,300 --> 00:51:00,500
And you know, um...

803
00:51:00,500 --> 00:51:02,600
Maybe we can find you
something

804
00:51:02,600 --> 00:51:05,300
away from the machines

805
00:51:05,300 --> 00:51:07,400
where your eyesight
wouldn't matter so much.

806
00:51:07,400 --> 00:51:08,300
Yeah...

807
00:51:08,300 --> 00:51:10,000
Not right away.

808
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:11,700
That's very kind
of you.

809
00:51:11,700 --> 00:51:12,900
I better go.

810
00:51:12,900 --> 00:51:16,100
I'll be okay.
I really will.

811
00:51:16,100 --> 00:51:17,900
Thanks, Norman.

812
00:51:17,900 --> 00:51:19,600
Thank you, Selma.

813
00:51:19,600 --> 00:51:20,500
Thank you.

814
00:51:37,900 --> 00:51:39,700
What is she
going to do now?

815
00:51:39,700 --> 00:51:41,400
Did you ever think
about that?

816
00:51:44,800 --> 00:51:46,800
Don't worry, Kathy.
Really.

817
00:51:46,800 --> 00:51:48,300
I'm gonna be fine.

818
00:51:50,900 --> 00:51:52,500
Has anybody
seen Jeff today?

819
00:51:52,500 --> 00:51:54,500
He's usually here
early, Selma,

820
00:51:54,500 --> 00:51:56,300
but not this early.

821
00:51:56,300 --> 00:51:57,500
It's a shame.

822
00:52:06,800 --> 00:52:08,600
Selma!

823
00:52:10,600 --> 00:52:12,600
Selma...

824
00:52:16,100 --> 00:52:18,500
I could give you
a lift if you want.

825
00:52:18,500 --> 00:52:20,900
I--I will need a lift...

826
00:52:20,900 --> 00:52:23,800
Later.

827
00:52:23,800 --> 00:52:25,400
I need to do
something important

828
00:52:25,400 --> 00:52:27,500
at...at 3:00.

829
00:52:28,600 --> 00:52:31,800
Well, you need to get
your truck then, don't you?

830
00:52:32,800 --> 00:52:33,700
Yeah.

831
00:52:41,500 --> 00:52:44,900
Train's coming.
Get off the track, Jeff.

832
00:52:44,900 --> 00:52:47,400
You have to be careful.

833
00:52:47,400 --> 00:52:48,900
Stay to the side.

834
00:52:55,400 --> 00:52:57,400
You can't see,
can you?

835
00:53:14,200 --> 00:53:16,800
What is there to see?

836
00:58:03,600 --> 00:58:06,000
You can't see,
can you?

837
00:58:07,900 --> 00:58:09,700
See you at 3:00.

838
00:58:16,200 --> 00:58:17,900
I can see.

839
00:59:10,700 --> 00:59:13,000
Gene hasn't
come back yet.

840
00:59:15,500 --> 00:59:18,300
I need to talk to Bill.

841
00:59:18,300 --> 00:59:19,800
He decided to
take the day off

842
00:59:19,800 --> 00:59:21,900
to go to the bank
for his box.

843
00:59:23,800 --> 00:59:25,400
Is he--is he upstairs?

844
00:59:25,400 --> 00:59:26,300
Yeah.

845
00:59:28,700 --> 00:59:30,800
I know everything, Selma.

846
00:59:30,800 --> 00:59:32,200
Bill told me.

847
00:59:32,200 --> 00:59:34,500
I want you to move out!

848
00:59:39,300 --> 00:59:41,100
I--I don't understand.

849
00:59:41,100 --> 00:59:43,300
Wh-what would you know?

850
00:59:45,700 --> 00:59:48,100
That you came on
to him.

851
00:59:48,100 --> 00:59:50,400
That you asked him
into the trailer,

852
00:59:50,400 --> 00:59:52,100
but he
turned you down!

853
00:59:57,700 --> 00:59:59,900
You've got nothing
to say for yourself?

854
01:00:01,700 --> 01:00:03,300
No.

855
01:00:03,300 --> 01:00:05,100
I want to talk to Bill.

856
01:00:24,200 --> 01:00:25,800
Hi, Bill.

857
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:31,400
Linda saw me go up
to the, um...

858
01:00:33,700 --> 01:00:35,600
Up to the trailer.

859
01:00:37,900 --> 01:00:40,700
I told her it was you
who wanted to, uh...

860
01:00:40,700 --> 01:00:42,400
That you'd...

861
01:00:42,400 --> 01:00:45,200
That you'd fallen
in love with me.

862
01:00:46,200 --> 01:00:49,400
I know.
She told me.

863
01:00:49,400 --> 01:00:51,200
And what did
you tell her?

864
01:00:51,200 --> 01:00:53,000
Nothing.

865
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:56,000
You didn't tell her
I was lying?

866
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:58,300
Mum's the word, right?

867
01:01:05,300 --> 01:01:07,700
Linda told me
you went to the bank.

868
01:01:09,700 --> 01:01:11,700
I went to the bank
to ask for more time.

869
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:17,400
But I couldn't do it.

870
01:01:17,400 --> 01:01:20,600
And I brought the box
home instead.

871
01:01:21,600 --> 01:01:23,000
Linda always
gets so proud

872
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:25,500
when she sees me
sitting in here with it.

873
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:29,600
But you have put
my money in it,

874
01:01:29,600 --> 01:01:30,900
haven't you?

875
01:01:33,300 --> 01:01:35,900
To make it look
like it's yours.

876
01:01:40,600 --> 01:01:43,200
I tried to shoot
myself, but...

877
01:01:46,700 --> 01:01:48,700
I couldn't
do that either.

878
01:01:51,300 --> 01:01:53,300
But it's my money, Bill.

879
01:01:53,300 --> 01:01:56,400
I'm gonna have to take it.

880
01:01:56,400 --> 01:01:58,000
Well, you
can have it back.

881
01:02:00,700 --> 01:02:02,100
No, you can have it.

882
01:02:02,100 --> 01:02:03,100
Bill...

883
01:02:03,100 --> 01:02:06,100
You can have it back
in a month.

884
01:02:09,900 --> 01:02:11,900
But--but I can't
do that, Bill.

885
01:02:11,900 --> 01:02:12,900
Selma.

886
01:02:12,900 --> 01:02:15,800
I--I've decided to...

887
01:02:15,800 --> 01:02:17,500
to pay the doctor

888
01:02:17,500 --> 01:02:20,000
this afternoon.

889
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:22,400
I can't save up more money.

890
01:02:22,400 --> 01:02:24,200
That's over now.

891
01:02:29,700 --> 01:02:31,600
Gene doesn't
even turn 1 3

892
01:02:31,600 --> 01:02:33,900
until after christmas.

893
01:02:33,900 --> 01:02:37,300
It was $2,026

894
01:02:37,300 --> 01:02:39,600
and 1 0 cents

895
01:02:39,600 --> 01:02:40,800
in the tin.

896
01:02:42,600 --> 01:02:45,200
I can't count it now,
but I trust you.

897
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:49,100
And it's...

898
01:02:49,100 --> 01:02:51,500
$30 I got today...

899
01:02:52,700 --> 01:02:54,300
which makes it

900
01:02:54,300 --> 01:02:58,200
2,056...

901
01:02:59,100 --> 01:03:00,700
and 1 0 cents.

902
01:03:00,700 --> 01:03:02,700
It's not enough.

903
01:03:03,800 --> 01:03:05,300
But it'll have to do.

904
01:03:05,300 --> 01:03:06,800
Selma...

905
01:03:06,800 --> 01:03:09,200
- Bye, Bill.
- Selma...

906
01:03:15,900 --> 01:03:18,100
Selma, stop.

907
01:03:20,100 --> 01:03:21,700
I'm pointing my gun
at you, Selma.

908
01:03:26,900 --> 01:03:29,100
I don't believe you.

909
01:03:29,100 --> 01:03:31,300
You're just trying
to scare me.

910
01:03:31,300 --> 01:03:33,200
I can't see a gun.

911
01:03:34,100 --> 01:03:35,800
Selma...

912
01:03:35,800 --> 01:03:37,500
Just... feel this.
Feel this.

913
01:03:37,500 --> 01:03:39,500
Just feel it!
Feel it!

914
01:03:41,900 --> 01:03:43,900
Do you believe
I have the gun?

915
01:03:43,900 --> 01:03:46,200
I believe you.

916
01:03:46,200 --> 01:03:47,400
But it's my money.

917
01:03:47,400 --> 01:03:49,300
No, it's my money.

918
01:03:49,300 --> 01:03:51,500
It's the money
I had in my box.

919
01:03:51,500 --> 01:03:53,500
And you're trying
to steal it from me.

920
01:03:53,500 --> 01:03:55,400
Selma?

921
01:03:55,400 --> 01:03:57,400
Selma!
Selma, stop!

922
01:03:57,400 --> 01:03:59,300
Selma, stop!
Linda!

923
01:03:59,300 --> 01:04:00,700
- No!
- Linda! Linda!

924
01:04:00,700 --> 01:04:02,800
What's the matter,
Bill?

925
01:04:05,200 --> 01:04:07,100
She tried to
steal the money.

926
01:04:08,600 --> 01:04:10,400
She knew I had
the gun in my...

927
01:04:10,400 --> 01:04:12,000
in my drawer
and she--

928
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:13,200
Is that why
you wanted him,

929
01:04:13,200 --> 01:04:14,600
for the money?

930
01:04:14,600 --> 01:04:16,600
Go out to the car
and get my handcuffs.

931
01:04:16,600 --> 01:04:18,700
Go get the handcuffs.

932
01:04:20,800 --> 01:04:23,400
Give me the money.

933
01:04:23,400 --> 01:04:25,300
Give me the money.

934
01:04:25,300 --> 01:04:28,200
Give me the money
and i'll let you go.

935
01:04:28,200 --> 01:04:29,500
No.

936
01:04:29,500 --> 01:04:30,800
No.

937
01:04:30,800 --> 01:04:32,100
Where should I go?

938
01:04:33,300 --> 01:04:34,800
Just give me
the money.

939
01:04:34,800 --> 01:04:36,800
Selma.

940
01:04:36,800 --> 01:04:38,900
Just give me
the money!

941
01:04:38,900 --> 01:04:39,900
The money.

942
01:04:39,900 --> 01:04:41,200
Give me the money!

943
01:04:41,200 --> 01:04:42,300
No!

944
01:04:42,300 --> 01:04:43,100
No!

945
01:04:43,100 --> 01:04:44,500
- Get--
- No!

946
01:04:47,700 --> 01:04:48,900
Bill!
Oh, Bill!

947
01:04:53,300 --> 01:04:54,700
You shot me.

948
01:05:00,900 --> 01:05:02,500
No, no, Selma.

949
01:05:02,500 --> 01:05:04,000
You did the right thing.

950
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:06,500
I should've done it
myself.

951
01:05:12,300 --> 01:05:13,800
Kill me.

952
01:05:16,200 --> 01:05:18,000
Just kill me.

953
01:05:19,100 --> 01:05:21,900
Will you just be
my friend...

954
01:05:21,900 --> 01:05:24,300
and show some mercy,
please, and just...

955
01:05:24,300 --> 01:05:25,400
kill me?

956
01:05:25,400 --> 01:05:27,900
Your handcuffs aren't
in the car, Bill.

957
01:05:27,900 --> 01:05:29,600
Just show
some mercy, Selma,

958
01:05:29,600 --> 01:05:30,900
and just...

959
01:05:35,200 --> 01:05:36,800
Linda, run.

960
01:05:36,800 --> 01:05:39,000
Run up to Miller's farm.
Just run up to Miller's farm

961
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:41,500
and call the station.
Tell them to hurry.

962
01:05:41,500 --> 01:05:44,300
Run! Get up there!
Go on to Miller's farm!

963
01:05:47,100 --> 01:05:49,000
If you want
the money...

964
01:05:54,100 --> 01:05:56,500
you're gonna have
to kill me.

965
01:05:56,500 --> 01:06:00,000
Don't do this to me.

966
01:06:08,800 --> 01:06:10,700
Don't do this
to me.

967
01:06:12,400 --> 01:06:14,000
I'm not letting go.

968
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:18,000
No.

969
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:19,800
Selma, shoot me!

970
01:06:19,800 --> 01:06:21,900
Just shoot me!
Shoot me! Shoot me!

971
01:06:21,900 --> 01:06:24,400
Shoot me!!

972
01:06:38,300 --> 01:06:40,000
Cant't you
just stand up

973
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:42,500
and pull
the goddamn trigger!

974
01:07:02,500 --> 01:07:04,600
I'll have to
take the money.

975
01:11:57,000 --> 01:11:58,500
Forgive me.

976
01:15:27,100 --> 01:15:28,500
Selma?

977
01:15:32,900 --> 01:15:35,400
Jeff.

978
01:15:42,500 --> 01:15:44,300
What are you
doing here?

979
01:15:49,100 --> 01:15:50,700
Is it already 3:00?

980
01:15:53,100 --> 01:15:54,600
Uh, not really.

981
01:15:54,600 --> 01:15:56,400
Hell, I'm always early.

982
01:16:04,700 --> 01:16:07,100
You cut yourself again.

983
01:16:07,100 --> 01:16:09,800
There's some blood
on your blouse.

984
01:16:09,800 --> 01:16:12,800
Strange.

985
01:16:12,800 --> 01:16:14,900
I couldn't feel it
at all.

986
01:16:49,900 --> 01:16:51,500
Selma...

987
01:16:53,300 --> 01:16:54,800
We're here now.

988
01:17:01,300 --> 01:17:02,900
By the bus stop?

989
01:17:05,100 --> 01:17:06,900
Yeah, the bus stop.

990
01:17:07,900 --> 01:17:09,900
It's over there.

991
01:17:09,900 --> 01:17:12,600
And the lake
is here?

992
01:17:12,600 --> 01:17:15,300
Promise me
that you won't follow me.

993
01:17:15,300 --> 01:17:17,300
Promise.

994
01:17:21,600 --> 01:17:23,300
Yeah, I promise.

995
01:19:05,100 --> 01:19:07,700
Dobry Vecer,
Pane Doktore.

996
01:19:07,700 --> 01:19:09,400
Dobry Vecer.

997
01:19:09,400 --> 01:19:11,900
I would like to pay
for the operation now.

998
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:16,800
$2,056...

999
01:19:16,800 --> 01:19:20,100
and 1 0 cents.

1000
01:19:20,100 --> 01:19:22,300
I know it's not quite

1001
01:19:22,300 --> 01:19:25,200
what you told me, but...

1002
01:19:25,200 --> 01:19:27,000
but it's all
I could get together.

1003
01:19:27,000 --> 01:19:28,700
Well.

1004
01:19:32,300 --> 01:19:34,100
What last name

1005
01:19:34,100 --> 01:19:35,600
shall I put
on the receipt?

1006
01:19:35,600 --> 01:19:38,600
Oh, I don't need
a receipt.

1007
01:19:38,600 --> 01:19:41,000
I really don't.

1008
01:19:41,000 --> 01:19:42,800
I have to know
the name of your son.

1009
01:19:42,800 --> 01:19:44,900
When he comes in
for his operation.

1010
01:19:46,700 --> 01:19:48,200
Novy...

1011
01:19:50,700 --> 01:19:52,100
He will come,

1012
01:19:52,100 --> 01:19:54,900
and he will say
that his name is Novy.

1013
01:19:56,500 --> 01:19:59,200
And then
you will know...

1014
01:19:59,200 --> 01:20:01,100
that he has
been paid for.

1015
01:20:01,100 --> 01:20:03,400
Novy?

1016
01:20:03,400 --> 01:20:06,500
Like Oldrich Novy,

1017
01:20:06,500 --> 01:20:08,200
the tap dancer?

1018
01:20:08,200 --> 01:20:10,000
It is strange,
isn't it?

1019
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:11,700
But he never really
made it over here,

1020
01:20:11,700 --> 01:20:13,300
did he?

1021
01:20:13,300 --> 01:20:17,100
I saw his films
when I was a kid.

1022
01:20:17,100 --> 01:20:19,300
He was in
the first musical

1023
01:20:19,300 --> 01:20:21,400
I ever saw.

1024
01:20:21,400 --> 01:20:23,300
Same here.

1025
01:20:28,600 --> 01:20:30,200
Selma?

1026
01:20:44,500 --> 01:20:46,500
It's Tuesday night.

1027
01:20:49,300 --> 01:20:51,000
What about
your rehearsal?

1028
01:20:53,800 --> 01:20:55,300
Yeah, I guess.

1029
01:20:56,900 --> 01:20:58,900
You want to go?

1030
01:20:58,900 --> 01:21:00,600
Yeah.

1031
01:21:00,600 --> 01:21:02,300
Then maybe put
your arm around her,

1032
01:21:02,300 --> 01:21:04,100
and... a little bit of...

1033
01:21:05,700 --> 01:21:07,300
Hi, Selma.

1034
01:21:07,300 --> 01:21:09,500
Hi, Samuel.

1035
01:21:09,500 --> 01:21:11,900
We weren't sure you'd
show up, actually.

1036
01:21:13,100 --> 01:21:14,500
Sure, I'd show up.

1037
01:21:16,500 --> 01:21:17,500
Hi.

1038
01:21:17,500 --> 01:21:19,100
Nice to see you.

1039
01:21:19,100 --> 01:21:19,800
Be right back.

1040
01:21:19,800 --> 01:21:21,100
Okay.

1041
01:21:35,600 --> 01:21:37,500
She's here.

1042
01:21:37,500 --> 01:21:38,500
Yeah.

1043
01:21:38,500 --> 01:21:40,100
Okay.

1044
01:21:41,200 --> 01:21:42,100
Okay.

1045
01:21:46,600 --> 01:21:48,700
Okay, I think--I
think you could...

1046
01:21:48,700 --> 01:21:51,700
try it one more time
for me.

1047
01:21:51,700 --> 01:21:54,300
But I should--
I should be going now.

1048
01:21:54,300 --> 01:21:56,600
I think Gene may wonder
where I am.

1049
01:21:58,500 --> 01:22:00,700
Jeff, he--he hasn't
seen me all day.

1050
01:22:00,700 --> 01:22:02,700
I think maybe we
could do your scene.

1051
01:22:02,700 --> 01:22:04,600
Let's do
the tapping scene.

1052
01:22:04,600 --> 01:22:06,900
Okay? We haven't
done it in weeks,

1053
01:22:06,900 --> 01:22:08,300
and we really need
to rehearse it,

1054
01:22:08,300 --> 01:22:09,400
and while you're here,
we might as well

1055
01:22:09,400 --> 01:22:12,300
take advantage
of the time, please?

1056
01:22:12,300 --> 01:22:13,700
Okay, let's do
the tapping scene.

1057
01:22:13,700 --> 01:22:14,800
You come offstage--

1058
01:22:14,800 --> 01:22:16,100
Let me have
the nuns up there.

1059
01:22:16,100 --> 01:22:17,500
Imagi--
you're going to do

1060
01:22:17,500 --> 01:22:18,400
Selma's part
for her

1061
01:22:18,400 --> 01:22:19,700
for right now,
all right?

1062
01:22:24,100 --> 01:22:25,100
You like it?

1063
01:22:25,100 --> 01:22:27,300
Yes.

1064
01:22:27,300 --> 01:22:29,100
We haven't done it
for a while.

1065
01:22:53,700 --> 01:22:55,200
Remember that part
we did where--

1066
01:22:55,200 --> 01:22:56,700
where you, uh...

1067
01:22:56,700 --> 01:22:58,700
you come to
the convent gate

1068
01:22:58,700 --> 01:23:00,800
to say goodbye
to the--to Maria?

1069
01:23:00,800 --> 01:23:02,700
I should leave, Jeff.

1070
01:23:02,700 --> 01:23:03,800
What?

1071
01:23:03,800 --> 01:23:05,700
Gene--Gene is
probably worried now.

1072
01:23:05,700 --> 01:23:07,800
I haven't seen him
all day.

1073
01:23:07,800 --> 01:23:09,100
All right.

1074
01:23:11,400 --> 01:23:13,500
I'm sorry, Samuel, but...

1075
01:23:13,500 --> 01:23:15,300
Betty, come here
for a second, please.

1076
01:23:15,300 --> 01:23:16,300
The drummer
that you wanted--

1077
01:23:16,300 --> 01:23:17,800
Remember, you asked
me for a drummer?

1078
01:23:17,800 --> 01:23:19,700
I found somebody.
She's fantastic.

1079
01:23:19,700 --> 01:23:21,000
Her name's Betty.
She's right here

1080
01:23:21,000 --> 01:23:22,100
for the first time
tonight.

1081
01:23:22,100 --> 01:23:24,900
Please meet her.
Selma, this is Betty.

1082
01:23:24,900 --> 01:23:26,100
Hi, Betty.

1083
01:23:26,100 --> 01:23:29,000
You play the drums?

1084
01:23:29,000 --> 01:23:30,000
Yeah.

1085
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:31,500
Tell her how long
you've been studying.

1086
01:23:31,500 --> 01:23:32,800
Two years.

1087
01:23:32,800 --> 01:23:34,500
She's wonderful.

1088
01:23:34,500 --> 01:23:35,900
You've got to stay
and enjoy this.

1089
01:23:35,900 --> 01:23:37,700
You've got to--
I have an idea.

1090
01:23:37,700 --> 01:23:39,900
Let's do the finale.

1091
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:42,800
I just remembered,
you hate finales.

1092
01:23:42,800 --> 01:23:44,400
No finale!

1093
01:23:44,400 --> 01:23:46,700
I've a better idea.

1094
01:23:46,700 --> 01:23:48,500
"Climb Every Mountain,"
part one.

1095
01:25:45,000 --> 01:25:46,700
The state will show

1096
01:25:46,700 --> 01:25:49,300
that the defendant
has not only perpetrated

1097
01:25:49,300 --> 01:25:51,300
the most callous...

1098
01:25:51,300 --> 01:25:54,200
and well-planned homicide
in recent memory...

1099
01:25:55,500 --> 01:25:58,700
but is also
a fundamentally selfish

1100
01:25:58,700 --> 01:26:00,900
individual...

1101
01:26:00,900 --> 01:26:02,900
who cynically hides

1102
01:26:02,900 --> 01:26:04,700
behind a handicap,

1103
01:26:04,700 --> 01:26:06,900
devoid of sympathy
for anybody

1104
01:26:06,900 --> 01:26:08,300
but herself.

1105
01:26:09,900 --> 01:26:12,900
This woman found
trust and friendship

1106
01:26:12,900 --> 01:26:16,600
when she sought refuge
in our country,

1107
01:26:16,600 --> 01:26:18,200
and the evidence will show

1108
01:26:18,200 --> 01:26:21,300
that she has repaid
such kindness with betrayal,

1109
01:26:21,300 --> 01:26:23,000
robbery, and murder,

1110
01:26:23,000 --> 01:26:25,300
inflicted upon
the very people

1111
01:26:25,300 --> 01:26:28,200
who opened their homes
and hearts to her.

1112
01:26:30,300 --> 01:26:32,000
Ladies and gentlemen
of the jury...

1113
01:26:33,100 --> 01:26:35,700
The evidence will prove
that she herself...

1114
01:26:35,700 --> 01:26:39,000
did not show that mercy
she will ask of us.

1115
01:26:40,300 --> 01:26:43,100
Is this the bag here,
detective?

1116
01:26:46,500 --> 01:26:47,700
Yes,
the very same.

1117
01:26:47,700 --> 01:26:49,800
Houston's blood
was all over it.

1118
01:26:49,800 --> 01:26:52,500
Well, shortly
before the homicide,

1119
01:26:52,500 --> 01:26:54,900
I had a checkup
on her vision,

1120
01:26:54,900 --> 01:26:58,700
and I found
that she was myopic.

1121
01:26:58,700 --> 01:26:59,900
It's nearsighted--

1122
01:26:59,900 --> 01:27:02,300
Nearsighted, but...
She could see.

1123
01:27:03,300 --> 01:27:04,200
Yes.

1124
01:27:05,700 --> 01:27:07,400
She said communism was...

1125
01:27:07,400 --> 01:27:09,300
better for human beings.

1126
01:27:11,200 --> 01:27:12,600
She had nothing
but contempt

1127
01:27:12,600 --> 01:27:14,600
for our great country
and its principles?

1128
01:27:14,600 --> 01:27:17,300
Apart from its musicals.
She said the American one...

1129
01:27:17,300 --> 01:27:18,800
the American ones
were better.

1130
01:27:18,800 --> 01:27:20,600
So...

1131
01:27:20,600 --> 01:27:22,700
the defendant
preferred Hollywood

1132
01:27:22,700 --> 01:27:24,200
to Vladivostok.

1133
01:27:25,300 --> 01:27:27,900
I suppose that's
an acknowledgement of sorts.

1134
01:27:27,900 --> 01:27:29,300
She just asked
many times

1135
01:27:29,300 --> 01:27:31,200
about the money.

1136
01:27:31,200 --> 01:27:33,200
She wanted to know
where it was?

1137
01:27:33,200 --> 01:27:34,500
That's right.

1138
01:27:34,500 --> 01:27:36,500
She asked you
about the gun?

1139
01:27:36,500 --> 01:27:38,100
Yes, she did.

1140
01:27:38,100 --> 01:27:40,500
She wanted to know
where it was kept?

1141
01:27:40,500 --> 01:27:42,400
That's right.

1142
01:27:42,400 --> 01:27:43,900
Bill was lying on the floor

1143
01:27:43,900 --> 01:27:46,700
and... he was wounded.

1144
01:27:46,700 --> 01:27:49,000
And...

1145
01:27:49,000 --> 01:27:51,000
And...

1146
01:27:51,000 --> 01:27:53,500
He was pleading for his life?

1147
01:27:53,500 --> 01:27:54,400
Yes.

1148
01:27:54,400 --> 01:27:56,700
"I--I beg you,
I beg you,

1149
01:27:56,700 --> 01:27:57,900
I beg you."

1150
01:27:57,900 --> 01:28:01,100
You showed him
no mercy, Selma!

1151
01:28:06,500 --> 01:28:09,700
You shall have
no mercy either!

1152
01:28:11,500 --> 01:28:14,700
Would you state your name
for the record, please?

1153
01:28:17,500 --> 01:28:19,700
Selma Jezkova.

1154
01:28:20,900 --> 01:28:24,500
And Bill and
Linda Houston...

1155
01:28:24,500 --> 01:28:26,400
were your friends,
is that right?

1156
01:28:29,900 --> 01:28:30,800
Yeah.

1157
01:28:30,800 --> 01:28:32,600
In fact, you lived
in a trailer

1158
01:28:32,600 --> 01:28:34,500
on their property.

1159
01:28:38,200 --> 01:28:39,700
Yeah.

1160
01:28:39,700 --> 01:28:41,500
And didn't they also

1161
01:28:41,500 --> 01:28:43,100
take care
of your young son

1162
01:28:43,100 --> 01:28:44,800
when you were at work?

1163
01:28:49,600 --> 01:28:50,600
Yeah.

1164
01:28:52,700 --> 01:28:53,900
They bought him a...

1165
01:28:53,900 --> 01:28:56,400
birthday present
recently.

1166
01:28:56,400 --> 01:28:57,700
Is that right?

1167
01:29:01,900 --> 01:29:04,000
Yeah. They
got him a bike.

1168
01:29:05,900 --> 01:29:08,700
Right.

1169
01:29:08,700 --> 01:29:11,200
Your sight
was poor,

1170
01:29:11,200 --> 01:29:13,200
you claim,
contrary to

1171
01:29:13,200 --> 01:29:15,600
the expert testimony
we have received.

1172
01:29:17,000 --> 01:29:19,600
But you saw
well enough

1173
01:29:19,600 --> 01:29:23,000
to inflict 34 wounds
on Bill Houston.

1174
01:29:24,600 --> 01:29:27,000
So why did you
kill him, actually?

1175
01:29:28,400 --> 01:29:30,300
If I may be
so bold to ask?

1176
01:29:36,500 --> 01:29:38,200
He asked me to.

1177
01:29:39,600 --> 01:29:41,300
He did?

1178
01:29:41,300 --> 01:29:42,700
How intriguing.

1179
01:29:42,700 --> 01:29:44,400
A man with
a fine career

1180
01:29:44,400 --> 01:29:47,100
and some wealth,
a happy marriage,

1181
01:29:47,100 --> 01:29:49,100
why would
this Bill Houston

1182
01:29:49,100 --> 01:29:50,500
ask you to kill him?

1183
01:29:56,000 --> 01:29:58,000
I promised not to say.

1184
01:29:58,000 --> 01:30:01,100
Well, that clears
things up immensely.

1185
01:30:01,100 --> 01:30:03,900
You promised
you wouldn't say.

1186
01:30:03,900 --> 01:30:06,500
In that case, we'll just
have to take your word for it

1187
01:30:06,500 --> 01:30:09,100
when you say
that the money you stole

1188
01:30:10,500 --> 01:30:11,700
that Bill Houston's savings

1189
01:30:11,700 --> 01:30:13,700
also disappeared
so mysteriously

1190
01:30:13,700 --> 01:30:15,200
that same day.

1191
01:30:15,200 --> 01:30:17,300
Just, uh...

1192
01:30:17,300 --> 01:30:19,500
Just where did you
get your money?

1193
01:30:23,500 --> 01:30:24,700
Well...

1194
01:30:26,300 --> 01:30:28,600
I'd been saving up.

1195
01:30:28,600 --> 01:30:32,200
Well, I suppose
you could call it that.

1196
01:30:32,200 --> 01:30:34,500
What were these savings
to be used for?

1197
01:30:34,500 --> 01:30:36,200
You never bought your son

1198
01:30:36,200 --> 01:30:38,000
so much as
a single birthday present,

1199
01:30:38,000 --> 01:30:39,800
as we've heard.

1200
01:30:43,500 --> 01:30:44,700
Yes?

1201
01:30:46,500 --> 01:30:48,700
My--my father.

1202
01:30:48,700 --> 01:30:51,200
In Czechoslovakia.

1203
01:30:55,100 --> 01:30:56,600
Your father?

1204
01:30:58,700 --> 01:31:00,100
And what,
pray tell...

1205
01:31:00,100 --> 01:31:01,500
is his name?

1206
01:31:05,900 --> 01:31:07,800
My--my father is...

1207
01:31:10,500 --> 01:31:12,900
Oldrich Novy.

1208
01:31:12,900 --> 01:31:14,000
So...

1209
01:31:15,200 --> 01:31:17,100
We're meant to believe...

1210
01:31:17,100 --> 01:31:18,900
that you killed
Bill Houston

1211
01:31:18,900 --> 01:31:20,700
by inflicting
34 wounds on him

1212
01:31:20,700 --> 01:31:23,200
because...

1213
01:31:23,200 --> 01:31:25,100
He asked you to.

1214
01:31:25,100 --> 01:31:27,800
Just as we're meant
to believe

1215
01:31:27,800 --> 01:31:29,600
that you were blind
when you did it...

1216
01:31:29,600 --> 01:31:33,600
Are meant to believe
that it was your own savings

1217
01:31:33,600 --> 01:31:35,300
that you stole from him...

1218
01:31:35,300 --> 01:31:36,700
Just as we're meant
to believe

1219
01:31:36,700 --> 01:31:38,800
that you sent all you had

1220
01:31:38,800 --> 01:31:40,600
to your father back home,

1221
01:31:40,600 --> 01:31:43,500
a man by the name
of Oldrich Novy.

1222
01:31:44,500 --> 01:31:45,800
Is that right?

1223
01:31:50,100 --> 01:31:51,600
Yes.

1224
01:31:53,100 --> 01:31:55,600
Thank you,
Miss Jezkova.

1225
01:32:04,100 --> 01:32:05,600
Ladies and gentlemen
of the jury,

1226
01:32:05,600 --> 01:32:08,400
you've now heard from
the defendant's own lips.

1227
01:32:08,400 --> 01:32:10,300
You must believe her,

1228
01:32:10,300 --> 01:32:12,800
just as you
must believe her

1229
01:32:12,800 --> 01:32:14,900
when she claims
her father's name

1230
01:32:14,900 --> 01:32:17,100
is Oldrich Novy.

1231
01:32:18,300 --> 01:32:20,100
Your Honor...

1232
01:32:20,100 --> 01:32:21,300
at this time,
the state calls

1233
01:32:21,300 --> 01:32:22,900
to the witness stand...

1234
01:32:24,400 --> 01:32:26,000
Oldrich Novy.

1235
01:32:35,900 --> 01:32:37,700
Please state
your full name.

1236
01:32:37,700 --> 01:32:40,100
The name is
Oldrich Novy.

1237
01:32:40,100 --> 01:32:43,600
And you used to live
in Czechoslovakia?

1238
01:32:44,600 --> 01:32:45,900
That is right.

1239
01:32:45,900 --> 01:32:48,300
I live now in California,
as you know.

1240
01:32:48,300 --> 01:32:50,500
That's right, that's
where we found you.

1241
01:32:50,500 --> 01:32:53,600
What exactly is
your relationship

1242
01:32:53,600 --> 01:32:55,300
with the defendant?

1243
01:32:59,600 --> 01:33:01,400
I do not know her.

1244
01:33:02,700 --> 01:33:04,600
You don't know her?

1245
01:33:04,600 --> 01:33:05,800
So...

1246
01:33:05,800 --> 01:33:08,300
You have not received money

1247
01:33:08,300 --> 01:33:09,700
from her.

1248
01:33:09,700 --> 01:33:11,100
Money that--that...

1249
01:33:11,100 --> 01:33:13,400
she says was so dearly earned?

1250
01:33:14,700 --> 01:33:16,000
No, I have not.

1251
01:33:16,000 --> 01:33:17,900
Perhaps you're
not her father then?

1252
01:33:19,100 --> 01:33:20,700
No, I am not.

1253
01:33:20,700 --> 01:33:22,200
Well, if
this relationship

1254
01:33:22,200 --> 01:33:25,200
was made up
by the defendant,

1255
01:33:25,200 --> 01:33:26,400
then...

1256
01:33:26,400 --> 01:33:27,500
can you think
of any way

1257
01:33:27,500 --> 01:33:29,900
she might've come
to know your name?

1258
01:33:29,900 --> 01:33:33,400
I was once well known
in Czechoslovakia

1259
01:33:33,400 --> 01:33:36,000
uh... because of my profession.

1260
01:33:36,000 --> 01:33:38,900
Yes, Mr. Oldrich Novy,
what is your profession?

1261
01:33:38,900 --> 01:33:40,800
Maybe that can give us
a clue to why,

1262
01:33:40,800 --> 01:33:43,100
why this somewhat...
romantic,

1263
01:33:43,100 --> 01:33:45,300
certainly communistic, woman

1264
01:33:45,300 --> 01:33:48,100
who worships Fred Astaire
but not his country,

1265
01:33:48,100 --> 01:33:50,000
why she might've lied...

1266
01:33:50,000 --> 01:33:52,100
and misused your name...

1267
01:33:52,100 --> 01:33:55,200
to make us think
all her money was spent

1268
01:33:55,200 --> 01:33:58,500
on a poor father
and not on her own vanity.

1269
01:33:58,500 --> 01:33:59,600
What is it that you do?

1270
01:33:59,600 --> 01:34:02,700
I was an actor.
I made films.

1271
01:34:02,700 --> 01:34:04,900
They were musicals.

1272
01:35:47,400 --> 01:35:48,900
Say it again!

1273
01:37:07,900 --> 01:37:10,100
Will the court please rise?

1274
01:37:12,100 --> 01:37:15,100
The honorable Judge
A.D. Mantle presiding.

1275
01:37:25,800 --> 01:37:27,800
Have you reached a verdict?

1276
01:37:29,500 --> 01:37:30,700
Yes, Your Honor.

1277
01:37:49,200 --> 01:37:51,900
Will the defendant
please rise?

1278
01:38:01,700 --> 01:38:03,800
We, the jury,
find the defendant

1279
01:38:03,800 --> 01:38:05,700
Selma Jezkova

1280
01:38:05,700 --> 01:38:07,600
guilty of murder
in the first degree

1281
01:38:07,600 --> 01:38:10,500
and hereby sentence her
to death.

1282
01:38:10,500 --> 01:38:13,200
Is this
the verdict of this jury?

1283
01:38:13,200 --> 01:38:16,700
You fully understand
that it must be unanimous?

1284
01:38:16,700 --> 01:38:19,000
We do, Your Honor.

1285
01:38:19,000 --> 01:38:21,300
Selma Jezkova...

1286
01:38:21,300 --> 01:38:23,700
You are hereby sentenced

1287
01:38:23,700 --> 01:38:25,700
to be taken from this place

1288
01:38:25,700 --> 01:38:28,100
and confined in
the state penitentiary

1289
01:38:28,100 --> 01:38:31,200
until such time
as you shall be executed

1290
01:38:31,200 --> 01:38:33,900
by being hanged
by the neck

1291
01:38:33,900 --> 01:38:35,500
until you are dead.

1292
01:38:35,500 --> 01:38:37,100
This court is adjourned.

1293
01:38:37,100 --> 01:38:38,500
All rise!

1294
01:38:55,800 --> 01:38:58,100
I've just heard
about the...

1295
01:38:58,100 --> 01:39:00,500
Supreme Court decision.

1296
01:39:00,500 --> 01:39:02,200
Yeah, l...

1297
01:39:02,200 --> 01:39:04,900
I just want to talk
practical stuff.

1298
01:39:09,100 --> 01:39:11,300
On Gene's birthday...

1299
01:39:13,500 --> 01:39:16,700
he will receive
a letter.

1300
01:39:16,700 --> 01:39:18,900
And it's so important,
Kathy...

1301
01:39:18,900 --> 01:39:21,700
that he reads it
really carefully.

1302
01:39:21,700 --> 01:39:24,800
I need you to take care
of that for me...

1303
01:39:24,800 --> 01:39:26,800
because I'm not
gonna be there

1304
01:39:26,800 --> 01:39:28,700
when he gets it.

1305
01:39:28,700 --> 01:39:30,200
He should not be afraid,

1306
01:39:30,200 --> 01:39:32,900
because there's nothing
to be afraid of, Kathy.

1307
01:39:32,900 --> 01:39:36,700
Listen, Gene wants
to see you so badly.

1308
01:39:36,700 --> 01:39:39,100
Won't you let him?
Please?

1309
01:39:42,700 --> 01:39:44,500
There's nothing
for him to see.

1310
01:39:47,000 --> 01:39:48,800
He's got you now,
Kathy.

1311
01:39:51,800 --> 01:39:54,300
And there's
one more thing:

1312
01:39:54,300 --> 01:39:56,900
He has to
call himself Novy.

1313
01:39:56,900 --> 01:39:58,700
That's
very important.

1314
01:39:58,700 --> 01:40:01,300
All right,
time's up, Selma.

1315
01:40:01,300 --> 01:40:03,200
I know that sounds
a bit foolish.

1316
01:40:03,200 --> 01:40:05,100
Novy?

1317
01:40:05,100 --> 01:40:06,400
I'm sorry I didn't
tell you before

1318
01:40:06,400 --> 01:40:08,400
about all this.
I just didn't dare to

1319
01:40:08,400 --> 01:40:11,100
because they would
ruin everything.

1320
01:40:11,100 --> 01:40:12,400
But what--
Why does he

1321
01:40:12,400 --> 01:40:14,100
have to call himself Novy?

1322
01:40:14,100 --> 01:40:16,100
Stop asking questions
like that, Cvalda.

1323
01:40:16,100 --> 01:40:18,900
Please... Iet me
tell Gene hello...

1324
01:40:18,900 --> 01:40:20,100
from you to him.

1325
01:40:21,900 --> 01:40:23,100
No.

1326
01:40:42,100 --> 01:40:43,800
I know you love
your son very much.

1327
01:40:45,700 --> 01:40:47,400
I love him very much.

1328
01:40:50,900 --> 01:40:53,300
Got a boy of my own
back home.

1329
01:40:58,500 --> 01:41:00,900
You never told me that.

1330
01:41:06,500 --> 01:41:07,700
Good night, Brenda.

1331
01:41:07,700 --> 01:41:08,900
Good night.

1332
01:41:08,900 --> 01:41:10,700
Say hi to your son
from me.

1333
01:41:13,200 --> 01:41:14,400
Thank you, Selma.

1334
01:42:09,600 --> 01:42:11,000
Can I help you?

1335
01:42:11,900 --> 01:42:14,200
Did you once have
a patient called...

1336
01:42:14,200 --> 01:42:17,000
Jezkova...

1337
01:42:17,000 --> 01:42:20,300
Selma Jezkova?

1338
01:42:20,300 --> 01:42:21,700
Well, if it wasn't
too long ago,

1339
01:42:21,700 --> 01:42:23,500
I can check
my records for you.

1340
01:42:26,200 --> 01:42:28,100
Jes... Jez... Jess...

1341
01:42:29,000 --> 01:42:31,000
Sorry, there's no one
here by that name.

1342
01:42:37,500 --> 01:42:39,100
What about Novy?

1343
01:42:40,700 --> 01:42:42,900
I have good news for you.

1344
01:42:42,900 --> 01:42:44,000
What's that?

1345
01:42:44,000 --> 01:42:45,200
We found a new lawyer...

1346
01:42:45,200 --> 01:42:48,400
and he's going to get
your case re-opened.

1347
01:42:48,400 --> 01:42:51,000
He says your lawyer
was incompetent.

1348
01:42:53,300 --> 01:42:54,700
What do you mean?

1349
01:42:56,700 --> 01:42:58,800
Well, the case is
going to be re-opened.

1350
01:43:00,300 --> 01:43:02,000
You won't get
the death sentence.

1351
01:43:04,100 --> 01:43:05,700
Is that true?

1352
01:43:05,700 --> 01:43:08,300
Yes. New information
has turned up.

1353
01:43:09,400 --> 01:43:10,900
Wh-what information?

1354
01:43:10,900 --> 01:43:12,900
Well, we know
the whole story, Selma.

1355
01:43:12,900 --> 01:43:15,500
Why didn't you tell us
anything?

1356
01:43:15,500 --> 01:43:17,100
You know, about...

1357
01:43:17,100 --> 01:43:19,200
about the money
for Gene's operation.

1358
01:43:22,600 --> 01:43:24,800
How did you find out?

1359
01:43:24,800 --> 01:43:26,600
Well, Jeff talked
to the doctor.

1360
01:43:28,700 --> 01:43:30,700
Does--does Gene know?

1361
01:43:33,100 --> 01:43:34,500
I mean,
have you told Gene?

1362
01:43:35,600 --> 01:43:38,000
No.
No, I didn't.

1363
01:43:38,000 --> 01:43:40,100
But you've got
a much better case now.

1364
01:43:40,100 --> 01:43:42,100
That's very important,
Kathy.

1365
01:43:44,300 --> 01:43:46,800
His eyes might get
worse from worrying,

1366
01:43:46,800 --> 01:43:48,700
and then the operation
won't work.

1367
01:43:49,700 --> 01:43:51,500
Yes, but, Selma...

1368
01:43:51,500 --> 01:43:53,300
Don't you see
that it would help you

1369
01:43:53,300 --> 01:43:55,700
if they knew that you
were trying to save your son

1370
01:43:55,700 --> 01:43:56,900
from going blind?

1371
01:43:57,900 --> 01:43:59,700
The lawyer,
he'll come and see you

1372
01:43:59,700 --> 01:44:01,700
in two weeks' time.

1373
01:44:01,700 --> 01:44:02,700
Kathy, but, uh...

1374
01:44:02,700 --> 01:44:04,500
You know
they're hanging me

1375
01:44:04,500 --> 01:44:05,400
in one week.

1376
01:44:05,400 --> 01:44:06,700
We know that,
but he says

1377
01:44:06,700 --> 01:44:08,300
you can apply for a stay.

1378
01:44:08,300 --> 01:44:10,700
You know, most cases
get one the first time.

1379
01:44:14,200 --> 01:44:15,800
Well, you can smile.

1380
01:44:17,200 --> 01:44:18,800
Selma...

1381
01:44:18,800 --> 01:44:21,400
Yeah... it's just
too much for me.

1382
01:44:24,600 --> 01:44:26,100
I thought
I was strong.

1383
01:44:26,100 --> 01:44:28,200
I just can't
take it, Kathy.

1384
01:44:28,200 --> 01:44:30,800
Apply for a stay.

1385
01:44:42,400 --> 01:44:44,100
What if they
don't phone?

1386
01:44:46,300 --> 01:44:50,000
Uh, well, you'll be
transferred to the other...

1387
01:44:50,000 --> 01:44:52,300
cell block
at some point tomorrow.

1388
01:44:54,900 --> 01:44:57,700
That's the cell block
where they hang people.

1389
01:45:01,400 --> 01:45:03,900
Yeah,
that's where they...

1390
01:45:03,900 --> 01:45:06,700
spend the last day.

1391
01:45:06,700 --> 01:45:09,700
And then they do
their 1 07 steps.

1392
01:45:09,700 --> 01:45:12,700
It's from that room...

1393
01:45:12,700 --> 01:45:14,500
to the gallows,
isn't it?

1394
01:45:16,400 --> 01:45:19,100
That's what they say,
Selma, but...

1395
01:45:19,100 --> 01:45:20,400
Look at...

1396
01:45:20,400 --> 01:45:22,200
You're gonna get
your stay.

1397
01:45:22,200 --> 01:45:24,600
Why don't you try to
think of something nice,

1398
01:45:24,600 --> 01:45:25,700
all right?

1399
01:45:29,100 --> 01:45:31,300
It's just
so quiet here.

1400
01:45:33,700 --> 01:45:35,600
What's that got
to do with it, Selma?

1401
01:45:40,300 --> 01:45:43,500
You know, when I used
to work in the factory...

1402
01:45:45,300 --> 01:45:48,600
I used to dream
that I was in a musical,

1403
01:45:48,600 --> 01:45:50,000
because, in a musical,

1404
01:45:50,000 --> 01:45:52,900
nothing dreadful
ever happens.

1405
01:45:56,800 --> 01:45:58,900
But it's so quiet here.

1406
01:46:01,300 --> 01:46:04,000
Don't the prisoners
march or something?

1407
01:46:04,000 --> 01:46:05,100
March?
No.

1408
01:46:05,100 --> 01:46:06,100
Yeah?

1409
01:46:06,100 --> 01:46:06,900
No, they don't.
They don't...

1410
01:46:06,900 --> 01:46:09,000
There's not...

1411
01:46:09,000 --> 01:46:10,600
There's not much noise
around here, Selma,

1412
01:46:10,600 --> 01:46:11,600
I know.

1413
01:46:14,200 --> 01:46:17,100
But later they
turn on the radio.

1414
01:46:17,100 --> 01:46:19,300
No, no, no.
There's no...

1415
01:46:19,300 --> 01:46:22,200
They don't allow radio
in the isolation block.

1416
01:46:23,300 --> 01:46:26,700
But I've been listening
to the ventilation...

1417
01:46:26,700 --> 01:46:28,800
shaft.

1418
01:46:28,800 --> 01:46:30,900
I hear sometimes
people singing there,

1419
01:46:30,900 --> 01:46:33,100
Iike...

1420
01:46:33,100 --> 01:46:34,200
hymns or...

1421
01:46:35,500 --> 01:46:36,800
That's not
against the rules,

1422
01:46:36,800 --> 01:46:38,600
to listen, is it?

1423
01:46:40,300 --> 01:46:41,500
No.

1424
01:46:41,500 --> 01:46:43,200
I wonder if...

1425
01:46:44,700 --> 01:46:46,400
if maybe you're
hearing the singing

1426
01:46:46,400 --> 01:46:47,900
coming from the chapel.

1427
01:46:47,900 --> 01:46:49,000
Yeah?

1428
01:46:51,700 --> 01:46:53,500
Maybe you'll
even get a sermon.

1429
01:50:38,900 --> 01:50:41,100
Selma...

1430
01:50:41,100 --> 01:50:42,700
Selma...

1431
01:50:43,900 --> 01:50:45,900
You got your stay.

1432
01:50:45,900 --> 01:50:47,600
You got the stay.

1433
01:50:50,300 --> 01:50:51,800
I'm so happy for you.

1434
01:51:06,200 --> 01:51:08,000
I'm your new legal counsel.

1435
01:51:08,000 --> 01:51:09,700
My name is Luke, okay?

1436
01:51:09,700 --> 01:51:11,500
Oh, hi, Luke.

1437
01:51:11,500 --> 01:51:14,400
I'm, uh, quite sure...

1438
01:51:14,400 --> 01:51:16,200
I can get your sentence
commuted.

1439
01:51:17,100 --> 01:51:18,700
All I need is a signature

1440
01:51:18,700 --> 01:51:21,500
stating you want
the case re-opened...

1441
01:51:21,500 --> 01:51:23,400
and then I can get
all the paperwork ready

1442
01:51:23,400 --> 01:51:25,000
by tomorrow.

1443
01:51:27,700 --> 01:51:28,900
Yeah.

1444
01:51:28,900 --> 01:51:31,500
There's a lot of things
your other lawyer didn't do

1445
01:51:31,500 --> 01:51:33,200
that I'm going to do.

1446
01:51:33,200 --> 01:51:35,300
A lot of ground
that wasn't covered

1447
01:51:35,300 --> 01:51:37,200
that I am going
to cover.

1448
01:51:37,200 --> 01:51:39,300
The fact that you were
fighting for your boy

1449
01:51:39,300 --> 01:51:41,200
is something
we can really milk.

1450
01:51:41,200 --> 01:51:45,100
I have some experience
in cases like this, so...

1451
01:51:46,200 --> 01:51:48,300
That's what
the attorney before said.

1452
01:51:48,300 --> 01:51:49,300
Uh... yeah.

1453
01:51:50,500 --> 01:51:54,300
You see, he was
appointed by the court,

1454
01:51:54,300 --> 01:51:56,400
and you don't get
the best legal counsel

1455
01:51:56,400 --> 01:51:57,400
that way.

1456
01:51:57,400 --> 01:51:59,900
Y-You were not
appointed by the court?

1457
01:51:59,900 --> 01:52:02,300
I'm not appointed
by the court, no.

1458
01:52:02,300 --> 01:52:04,000
You're gonna have
to pay me.

1459
01:52:07,600 --> 01:52:10,200
But... not to worry.

1460
01:52:10,200 --> 01:52:11,100
Yeah?

1461
01:52:11,100 --> 01:52:12,500
That's been
taken care of.

1462
01:52:12,500 --> 01:52:15,400
I made a deal with
your... Iady friend?

1463
01:52:15,400 --> 01:52:16,500
Deal?

1464
01:52:16,500 --> 01:52:19,500
Yeah, in regard
to my fee.

1465
01:52:19,500 --> 01:52:21,700
I've agreed to
accept the amount

1466
01:52:21,700 --> 01:52:24,100
that she said
she could raise.

1467
01:52:33,100 --> 01:52:34,600
How much...

1468
01:52:35,900 --> 01:52:37,300
How much was it?

1469
01:52:37,300 --> 01:52:38,800
Well, I can tell you
precisely,

1470
01:52:38,800 --> 01:52:40,000
because I received
an envelope.

1471
01:52:40,000 --> 01:52:42,300
It's, uh,
two thousand dollars--

1472
01:52:42,300 --> 01:52:46,400
$2,056.1 0?

1473
01:52:46,400 --> 01:52:48,300
That's it precisely.

1474
01:52:50,300 --> 01:52:52,700
Now...

1475
01:52:54,700 --> 01:52:56,900
There's something here.

1476
01:52:58,400 --> 01:53:02,300
I'd like to just sort of
go over our tactics.

1477
01:53:02,300 --> 01:53:04,900
I have a couple of
questions to ask you.

1478
01:53:04,900 --> 01:53:06,700
If he doesn't have
the operation next month,

1479
01:53:06,700 --> 01:53:08,100
it's gonna be too late!

1480
01:53:08,100 --> 01:53:10,700
And he will never
be able to see!

1481
01:53:10,700 --> 01:53:12,800
This is what
it's all about,

1482
01:53:12,800 --> 01:53:14,500
so he can see
his grandchildren!

1483
01:53:14,500 --> 01:53:16,600
Well, let me
tell you something.

1484
01:53:16,600 --> 01:53:17,700
The only thing
that's important to me

1485
01:53:17,700 --> 01:53:19,600
in my whole life,

1486
01:53:19,600 --> 01:53:21,700
and you don't
understand, Kathy!

1487
01:53:21,700 --> 01:53:23,300
- Listen to me!
- It's just plain stupidity!

1488
01:53:23,300 --> 01:53:24,800
- Listen to me!
- Waste that kind of money...

1489
01:53:24,800 --> 01:53:26,600
on a blind woman
who's gonna spend

1490
01:53:26,600 --> 01:53:28,100
the rest of her life
in jail!

1491
01:53:28,100 --> 01:53:29,500
But he needs his mother,
you know,

1492
01:53:29,500 --> 01:53:30,400
alive,
no matter where!

1493
01:53:30,400 --> 01:53:31,900
You don't understand!

1494
01:53:31,900 --> 01:53:33,200
He needs his eyes!

1495
01:53:33,200 --> 01:53:34,500
- He needs his mother!
- No!

1496
01:53:34,500 --> 01:53:36,500
- Yes! Alive!
- No!

1497
01:53:36,500 --> 01:53:38,200
Listen to reason
for once!

1498
01:53:38,200 --> 01:53:39,500
Selma.

1499
01:53:40,500 --> 01:53:41,600
Selma.

1500
01:53:41,600 --> 01:53:43,400
I listen to my heart.

1501
01:53:43,400 --> 01:53:45,700
I will go to the police.
I will tell them that...

1502
01:53:45,700 --> 01:53:47,800
you stole the money
from... from Bill.

1503
01:53:49,100 --> 01:53:50,400
Oh, yes,
I will tell that.

1504
01:53:50,400 --> 01:53:52,300
I will
tell them that,

1505
01:53:52,300 --> 01:53:53,600
that you stole it
from Bill,

1506
01:53:53,600 --> 01:53:55,500
and you will never see
the money again!

1507
01:53:55,500 --> 01:53:57,700
That will be gone
for good.

1508
01:53:57,700 --> 01:54:00,900
No operation! Nothing!
No mother! Nothing!

1509
01:54:09,900 --> 01:54:12,600
You can have
your money back.

1510
01:54:12,600 --> 01:54:13,500
I just want
to make sure

1511
01:54:13,500 --> 01:54:16,800
that you fully comprehend

1512
01:54:16,800 --> 01:54:19,600
what this means,
this decision.

1513
01:54:19,600 --> 01:54:20,500
Yeah.

1514
01:54:20,500 --> 01:54:21,800
You fully realize
what will happen?

1515
01:54:21,800 --> 01:54:22,900
Yeah.

1516
01:54:22,900 --> 01:54:26,000
I already asked
for no more stays.

1517
01:54:26,000 --> 01:54:27,800
Once this starts,
there's no stopping it.

1518
01:54:27,800 --> 01:54:29,100
You understand me?

1519
01:54:30,100 --> 01:54:31,300
Yeah.

1520
01:54:33,200 --> 01:54:34,700
I'm prepared.

1521
01:54:44,400 --> 01:54:46,500
Gene says thank you.

1522
01:54:49,700 --> 01:54:51,500
Thanks for what?

1523
01:54:55,300 --> 01:54:58,200
Oh, some comic books
on his birthday.

1524
01:55:01,500 --> 01:55:04,400
You can't buy him...
presents

1525
01:55:04,400 --> 01:55:07,500
and say it's from me.

1526
01:55:07,500 --> 01:55:09,700
You have to stop
doing that, Jeff.

1527
01:55:10,700 --> 01:55:13,200
Uh, maybe
you can just...

1528
01:55:17,700 --> 01:55:19,300
phone him.

1529
01:55:21,100 --> 01:55:24,100
Just say,
you know...

1530
01:55:24,100 --> 01:55:25,700
something to him.

1531
01:55:25,700 --> 01:55:27,900
No, that's--that's
not a good idea.

1532
01:55:32,100 --> 01:55:34,800
He wants to be the one...

1533
01:55:36,300 --> 01:55:39,200
who's allowed to be there
when it happens.

1534
01:55:42,500 --> 01:55:45,700
But l-- And then
they told him

1535
01:55:45,700 --> 01:55:47,100
he's too young.

1536
01:55:49,900 --> 01:55:52,800
Who put that crazy idea
into his head anyway?

1537
01:55:55,200 --> 01:55:56,700
I don't want him
to be there.

1538
01:55:59,500 --> 01:56:01,300
I'll be there
if you would.

1539
01:56:03,400 --> 01:56:05,200
And Kathy?

1540
01:56:10,900 --> 01:56:12,900
You know Kathy.
She's...

1541
01:56:14,900 --> 01:56:16,500
She's still angry.

1542
01:56:18,700 --> 01:56:21,100
If you think
you can take it...

1543
01:56:24,000 --> 01:56:25,900
I would love you
to be there.

1544
01:56:33,100 --> 01:56:35,800
Don't cry, Jeff.

1545
01:56:35,800 --> 01:56:38,100
Jeff, don't cry.
It's gonna be fine.

1546
01:56:40,300 --> 01:56:41,700
Jeff.

1547
01:56:51,200 --> 01:56:53,000
Why did you have him?

1548
01:56:54,600 --> 01:56:57,200
You knew he would have
the same disease as you.

1549
01:57:07,100 --> 01:57:09,900
I just wanted to hold
a little baby...

1550
01:57:14,200 --> 01:57:15,900
just in my arms.

1551
01:57:22,700 --> 01:57:24,100
I love you.

1552
01:57:54,900 --> 01:57:56,700
It's time, Selma.

1553
01:58:22,300 --> 01:58:23,900
Okay?

1554
01:58:26,700 --> 01:58:28,100
Okay.

1555
01:59:44,900 --> 01:59:46,600
Your meal, Jezkova.

1556
02:00:50,100 --> 02:00:52,400
Selma Jezkova...

1557
02:00:52,400 --> 02:00:53,500
It's time.

1558
02:01:11,700 --> 02:01:13,200
Please stand.

1559
02:01:15,300 --> 02:01:17,100
She can walk on her own.

1560
02:01:21,200 --> 02:01:23,300
Selma...

1561
02:01:23,300 --> 02:01:27,000
I'm afraid my legs
aren't working very well.

1562
02:01:27,000 --> 02:01:28,700
You can do it, Selma.

1563
02:01:28,700 --> 02:01:29,800
Yeah.

1564
02:01:29,800 --> 02:01:30,900
I have a plan, okay?

1565
02:01:30,900 --> 02:01:32,000
Yeah.

1566
02:01:33,400 --> 02:01:34,900
You're gonna
stand up with me.

1567
02:01:34,900 --> 02:01:35,900
Yeah.

1568
02:01:37,400 --> 02:01:38,500
I may make some noise.

1569
02:01:40,700 --> 02:01:42,300
It will give you
something to listen to.

1570
02:01:42,300 --> 02:01:43,100
Yeah.

1571
02:01:43,100 --> 02:01:44,100
Listen.

1572
02:01:49,500 --> 02:01:52,500
There's 1 07 steps.

1573
02:01:52,500 --> 02:01:54,000
Selma, listen
to the mark.

1574
02:01:54,000 --> 02:01:55,400
I couldn't even do one.

1575
02:01:55,400 --> 02:01:56,600
You can do it.

1576
02:01:56,600 --> 02:01:59,600
I can't do it!

1577
02:01:59,600 --> 02:02:01,200
Now listen, Selma.

1578
02:02:02,300 --> 02:02:04,600
I want you to do
one--there, one.

1579
02:02:06,800 --> 02:02:08,700
Come on.

1580
02:02:08,700 --> 02:02:09,800
Listen.

1581
02:02:11,700 --> 02:02:12,900
Two.

1582
02:02:14,500 --> 02:02:16,000
Three...

1583
02:02:16,000 --> 02:02:16,900
four...

1584
02:02:16,900 --> 02:02:19,300
five... six...

1585
02:02:19,300 --> 02:02:21,100
seven... eight...

1586
02:02:21,100 --> 02:02:23,100
nine... ten...

1587
02:02:23,100 --> 02:02:26,100
1 1 ... 1 2... 1 3...

1588
02:02:26,100 --> 02:02:27,900
1 4... 1 5...

1589
02:02:27,900 --> 02:02:30,600
1 6... 1 7... 1 8...

1590
02:02:30,600 --> 02:02:32,900
1 9... 20...

1591
02:02:32,900 --> 02:02:35,300
21 ... 22... 23...

1592
02:02:35,300 --> 02:02:37,500
24... 25...

1593
02:02:37,500 --> 02:02:40,300
26... 27... 28...

1594
02:02:40,300 --> 02:02:42,000
29... 30...

1595
02:02:49,500 --> 02:02:51,300
39... 40...

1596
02:02:53,800 --> 02:02:56,100
43... 44... 45...

1597
02:03:05,700 --> 02:03:07,000
55... 56...

1598
02:03:10,400 --> 02:03:12,500
60... 61 ... 62...

1599
02:03:20,000 --> 02:03:22,300
70... 71 ... 72...

1600
02:03:24,200 --> 02:03:27,500
75... 76... 77...

1601
02:03:43,800 --> 02:03:46,000
93... 94... 95...

1602
02:03:52,100 --> 02:03:54,300
1 04... 1 05...

1603
02:03:54,300 --> 02:03:55,700
1 06...

1604
02:03:55,700 --> 02:03:57,800
1 07.

1605
02:03:57,800 --> 02:03:59,500
Selma Jezkova,

1606
02:03:59,500 --> 02:04:00,900
do you have
any last words?

1607
02:04:05,900 --> 02:04:07,600
Very well.
Proceed.

1608
02:04:16,700 --> 02:04:18,100
Selma.

1609
02:04:19,700 --> 02:04:21,400
Selma, you okay?

1610
02:04:24,900 --> 02:04:26,000
It's okay.
It's okay.

1611
02:04:29,900 --> 02:04:31,800
Come on now.

1612
02:04:31,800 --> 02:04:32,900
Use the board.

1613
02:04:32,900 --> 02:04:34,400
Oh, no, no. No, wait.
Give her a chance.

1614
02:04:34,400 --> 02:04:36,000
She can stand up.
She can stand.

1615
02:04:50,500 --> 02:04:51,400
In here.

1616
02:04:51,400 --> 02:04:54,700
It's okay.
It's okay.

1617
02:04:54,700 --> 02:04:56,100
It's okay.

1618
02:04:56,100 --> 02:04:58,000
It's okay.

1619
02:05:00,500 --> 02:05:02,400
It's okay.

1620
02:05:02,400 --> 02:05:03,300
The straps
on her hands.

1621
02:05:03,300 --> 02:05:04,500
I'm scared.

1622
02:05:04,500 --> 02:05:05,600
It's okay.

1623
02:05:05,600 --> 02:05:07,200
- I'm so scared!
- I know.

1624
02:05:14,400 --> 02:05:15,700
On the mark.

1625
02:05:24,000 --> 02:05:25,300
No!

1626
02:05:25,300 --> 02:05:26,800
I can't do the hood!

1627
02:05:26,800 --> 02:05:28,700
It's okay.
Selma.

1628
02:05:28,700 --> 02:05:30,400
I have to breathe!

1629
02:05:30,400 --> 02:05:32,100
Nobody told me
about the hood!

1630
02:05:32,100 --> 02:05:34,000
It's just so
you can't see, Selma.

1631
02:05:34,000 --> 02:05:35,400
- I can't breathe!
- I know.

1632
02:05:35,400 --> 02:05:36,800
I can't breathe!

1633
02:05:36,800 --> 02:05:38,500
- Look, look--
- I can't breathe!

1634
02:05:38,500 --> 02:05:39,500
I have to breathe!

1635
02:05:39,500 --> 02:05:40,200
Look,
she can't breathe.

1636
02:05:41,200 --> 02:05:43,300
She can't breathe!
She can't--

1637
02:05:43,300 --> 02:05:45,200
I'm taking it.
I'm taking it.

1638
02:05:45,200 --> 02:05:47,100
This is irregular.

1639
02:05:47,100 --> 02:05:48,800
I don't care
if it's irregular.

1640
02:05:48,800 --> 02:05:49,900
- We have regulations.
- She's blind--

1641
02:05:49,900 --> 02:05:51,500
I don't care about
the regulations!

1642
02:05:51,500 --> 02:05:52,500
The girl is blind,
for Christ's sake.

1643
02:05:52,500 --> 02:05:53,600
I'm gonna make a call.

1644
02:05:53,600 --> 02:05:55,400
Yeah, make the call--

1645
02:05:57,800 --> 02:05:58,800
Gene...

1646
02:05:58,800 --> 02:06:00,900
Yeah, we
have a situation here.

1647
02:06:00,900 --> 02:06:02,300
I'll hold for him.

1648
02:06:03,300 --> 02:06:04,300
Gene...

1649
02:06:04,300 --> 02:06:05,700
The woman's blind...
I'll wait.

1650
02:06:05,700 --> 02:06:07,900
Gene...

1651
02:06:07,900 --> 02:06:08,800
Gene...

1652
02:06:10,900 --> 02:06:12,200
Waiting for a call.

1653
02:06:12,200 --> 02:06:14,000
Gene...

1654
02:06:22,300 --> 02:06:23,600
Gene!

1655
02:06:23,800 --> 02:06:25,100
Gene!

1656
02:06:28,100 --> 02:06:29,200
Gene!

1657
02:06:29,200 --> 02:06:31,300
He--he's just outside.

1658
02:06:31,300 --> 02:06:33,100
He gave me these
for you.

1659
02:06:33,100 --> 02:06:34,500
Guard.

1660
02:06:34,500 --> 02:06:36,100
So he had the operation?

1661
02:06:36,100 --> 02:06:38,900
He will see
his grandchildren!

1662
02:06:38,900 --> 02:06:40,400
He is just outside.

1663
02:06:41,500 --> 02:06:42,700
You were right, Selma!
