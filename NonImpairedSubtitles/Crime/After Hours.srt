1
00:01:13,356 --> 00:01:17,383
- Okay, punch. Punch it in.
- Right.

2
00:01:17,927 --> 00:01:22,227
Okay, let's, first of all,
refresh the screen here...

3
00:01:22,932 --> 00:01:24,866
and go in a format ruler.

4
00:01:28,037 --> 00:01:30,631
- There.
- All right.

5
00:01:31,007 --> 00:01:33,134
- Now, file?
- Right.

6
00:01:34,711 --> 00:01:36,702
- And it's in memory?
- Right.

7
00:01:38,681 --> 00:01:39,909
And...

8
00:01:42,519 --> 00:01:44,578
mark this down in the prefix file codes.

9
00:01:44,654 --> 00:01:46,383
- Prefix code. Right.
- Okay.

10
00:01:48,491 --> 00:01:51,722
Good. Yeah, you got it.
Another week, you'll have it down.

11
00:01:51,795 --> 00:01:53,387
It's temporary anyway.

12
00:01:53,763 --> 00:01:55,355
I said it's temporary anyway.

13
00:01:55,431 --> 00:01:58,491
I do not intend to be stuck doing this
for the rest of my life.

14
00:01:58,568 --> 00:02:01,765
- Don't tell Mr. Digman I said that, please.
- Okay.

15
00:02:01,838 --> 00:02:05,706
Because what I really wanna do is
I'd really like to get into publishing.

16
00:02:05,775 --> 00:02:07,333
There aren't any openings right now.

17
00:02:07,410 --> 00:02:11,642
But what I would love to do
is create my own magazine...

18
00:02:12,782 --> 00:02:16,274
which would be like a forum
for writers and intellectuals...

19
00:02:16,352 --> 00:02:18,718
who can't get into print anywhere else.

20
00:02:19,556 --> 00:02:22,957
I'm not into editing
or trying to reach a particular audience.

21
00:02:23,026 --> 00:02:25,893
Getting it out there,
they would get some momentum going...

22
00:02:25,962 --> 00:02:28,829
and do something with...

23
00:02:30,366 --> 00:02:32,664
- With, you know...
- Excuse me, please.

24
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:32,821
I love that book.

25
00:03:40,536 --> 00:03:44,097
- I love that book.
- Yeah.

26
00:03:46,643 --> 00:03:48,508
I think Miller's really great.

27
00:03:48,578 --> 00:03:51,513
"This is not a book.
This is a prolonged insult...

28
00:03:52,148 --> 00:03:54,275
"a gob of spit in the face of Art...

29
00:03:55,118 --> 00:03:57,951
"a kick in the pants
to truth, beauty, God..."

30
00:03:58,054 --> 00:03:59,544
Something like that.

31
00:03:59,923 --> 00:04:01,254
That's very good.

32
00:04:01,491 --> 00:04:03,083
That's all I remember.

33
00:04:03,526 --> 00:04:07,394
I've read this before. I am just rereading it.

34
00:04:08,097 --> 00:04:10,327
I don't reread books that often...

35
00:04:11,467 --> 00:04:13,059
but this one's my favorite.

36
00:04:13,136 --> 00:04:17,072
I like it better than <i>Capricorn</i> or <i>Plexus...</i>

37
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:19,034
or <i>Sexus.</i>

38
00:04:20,276 --> 00:04:23,268
He used to kiss himself
after he ate a good meal.

39
00:04:23,813 --> 00:04:25,371
It's mostly...

40
00:04:29,419 --> 00:04:32,877
Let me ask you. Does that cashier
seem a little weird to you?

41
00:04:35,792 --> 00:04:38,158
He keeps making
these strange movements.

42
00:04:45,268 --> 00:04:46,565
God!

43
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:50,395
I think he's just waiting to be discovered.

44
00:04:54,744 --> 00:04:56,234
Do you want another coffee?

45
00:04:56,312 --> 00:04:59,247
No. I'm gonna head over
to my friend's house.

46
00:05:00,316 --> 00:05:03,080
- Which way you headed?
- Downtown, SoHo.

47
00:05:03,186 --> 00:05:05,677
Nice. A loft?

48
00:05:05,822 --> 00:05:07,756
Yeah. She's a sculptress.

49
00:05:08,458 --> 00:05:12,326
Lately, she's been making these
plaster-of-Paris bagels and cream cheese.

50
00:05:13,463 --> 00:05:14,521
Really?

51
00:05:15,198 --> 00:05:18,167
She's trying to sell them as paperweights.
You wanna buy one?

52
00:05:18,234 --> 00:05:19,394
Paperweight?

53
00:05:21,270 --> 00:05:25,468
- Yeah, I would. How much are they?
- I don't know.

54
00:05:26,509 --> 00:05:29,876
If you think you might be interested,
her number's 243-3460.

55
00:05:29,946 --> 00:05:31,573
243-3460.

56
00:05:34,751 --> 00:05:38,118
- Her name is Kiki Bridges.
- Kiki Bridges. Okay.

57
00:05:39,522 --> 00:05:42,355
- Nice talking to you.
- Yeah. Great talking to you.

58
00:05:53,236 --> 00:05:55,363
Excuse me. Can I borrow your pen?

59
00:05:59,509 --> 00:06:00,874
Thank you.

60
00:06:16,426 --> 00:06:19,395
- <i>Yeah?</i>
- Yes. Is Kiki Bridges there, please?

61
00:06:19,462 --> 00:06:21,191
- <i>This is her.</i>
- Hi.

62
00:06:21,531 --> 00:06:25,592
You don't know me. I'm calling because
I'm interested in your paperweights.

63
00:06:27,303 --> 00:06:30,272
- <i>Yeah.</i>
- You're the sculptress, right?

64
00:06:32,075 --> 00:06:35,875
A girl I met tonight at a coffee shop
told me that she was staying with you...

65
00:06:35,945 --> 00:06:37,242
<i>You mean Marcy.</i>

66
00:06:37,647 --> 00:06:40,878
- I don't know. She didn't tell me her name.
- <i>Hold on. I'll get her.</i>

67
00:06:40,950 --> 00:06:45,148
She told me about these paperweights
and the work that you do.

68
00:06:45,221 --> 00:06:46,381
<i>Hello?</i>

69
00:06:46,756 --> 00:06:49,748
- Hello? Marcy?
- <i>Yeah?</i>

70
00:06:49,826 --> 00:06:52,818
Hi. This is Paul Hackett.
We met earlier tonight.

71
00:06:54,197 --> 00:06:57,325
<i>Hi. Sure, I remember.</i>

72
00:06:58,101 --> 00:07:00,729
- <i>How are you?</i>
- I'm all right.

73
00:07:01,471 --> 00:07:02,597
I just got in...

74
00:07:02,672 --> 00:07:06,369
and I opened up my book
and saw your number...

75
00:07:08,010 --> 00:07:09,136
<i>Good.</i>

76
00:07:09,879 --> 00:07:11,676
<i>I'm glad you called.</i>

77
00:07:12,548 --> 00:07:13,708
<i>So...</i>

78
00:07:14,917 --> 00:07:19,115
So, do you work near that coffee shop
or live in the neighborhood?

79
00:07:19,388 --> 00:07:23,119
<i>No, I was just over</i>
<i>at a good friend of mine's.</i>

80
00:07:24,827 --> 00:07:27,261
<i>Actually, we had a terrible argument.</i>

81
00:07:30,633 --> 00:07:34,399
- That's too bad.
- <i>Yeah, it is.</i>

82
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:39,733
Whatever it was,
I'm sure you'll straighten it out.

83
00:07:39,809 --> 00:07:43,301
<i>You think so?</i>
<i>Do you think I should try to make up?</i>

84
00:07:44,981 --> 00:07:48,212
I don't know. Maybe you're better off.

85
00:07:48,284 --> 00:07:51,811
I don't know what the circumstances
were, but sometimes...

86
00:07:53,055 --> 00:07:56,252
You know, I don't...
I mean it's not my business.

87
00:07:57,426 --> 00:07:59,724
- <i>Maybe you should come over.</i>
- What?

88
00:08:00,863 --> 00:08:04,458
- <i>Maybe you should come on over.</i>
- Sure. Now?

89
00:08:04,534 --> 00:08:06,297
<i>Yeah. Why not?</i>

90
00:08:08,037 --> 00:08:09,197
Where to?

91
00:08:09,272 --> 00:08:12,503
<i>I'm at 28 Howard Street.</i>
<i>Near the corner of Crosby.</i>

92
00:08:12,742 --> 00:08:14,107
<i>It's in SoHo.</i>

93
00:08:14,177 --> 00:08:17,146
- <i>The name on the buzzer is Franklin.</i>
- Not Bridges?

94
00:08:17,313 --> 00:08:19,247
<i>Bridges is crossed out.</i>

95
00:08:19,715 --> 00:08:21,307
<i>Just press the buzzer.</i>

96
00:08:22,285 --> 00:08:25,118
Okay. About 45 minutes?

97
00:08:25,321 --> 00:08:27,846
- <i>Yeah, great. I'll see you later.</i>
- All right.

98
00:08:28,057 --> 00:08:29,456
- <i>Paul?</i>
- Yes.

99
00:08:30,927 --> 00:08:34,192
- <i>I'm really glad you called.</i>
- Me, too.

100
00:08:36,132 --> 00:08:38,157
Okay, I'll see you later.

101
00:08:38,534 --> 00:08:39,865
- <i>Bye.</i>
- Bye.

102
00:08:49,979 --> 00:08:53,642
- I've only got a $20. Can you break it?
- Yeah, sure. No problem.

103
00:08:57,286 --> 00:08:58,548
No hurry.

104
00:09:30,019 --> 00:09:33,853
Excuse me, I just... Damn! My God!

105
00:09:37,093 --> 00:09:38,458
Excuse me.

106
00:09:45,034 --> 00:09:47,229
My money flew out the window.

107
00:10:08,991 --> 00:10:10,549
Okay, that'll be $6.50.

108
00:10:10,626 --> 00:10:13,925
Listen, my money
just flew out the window.

109
00:10:14,163 --> 00:10:15,755
I put it in this cradle.

110
00:10:15,831 --> 00:10:20,165
You went so fast around that corner
that I don't have any...

111
00:10:21,470 --> 00:10:24,871
What I'm saying is, I don't have
any money. I'm really sorry.

112
00:10:25,308 --> 00:10:27,674
Look, let me show you something.

113
00:10:29,145 --> 00:10:30,407
Look, that was...

114
00:10:30,479 --> 00:10:33,812
I had $20, and now I don't have any more.

115
00:10:33,883 --> 00:10:35,214
I'm really sorry.

116
00:10:48,898 --> 00:10:50,195
Franklin.

117
00:11:05,181 --> 00:11:06,978
- Are you Paul?
- Yeah.

118
00:11:07,149 --> 00:11:08,275
Here, catch.

119
00:11:35,845 --> 00:11:38,279
Hi.

120
00:11:43,786 --> 00:11:46,755
- Your keys.
- You can just put them on the table.

121
00:11:52,495 --> 00:11:54,793
- I like that.
- Do you?

122
00:11:54,964 --> 00:11:56,522
Yeah. Very much.

123
00:11:57,666 --> 00:12:00,396
It reminds me of that
Edvard Munch painting.

124
00:12:00,703 --> 00:12:02,136
Was it The Shriek?

125
00:12:03,606 --> 00:12:05,938
- The Scream.
- Right.

126
00:12:08,244 --> 00:12:09,438
Yeah.

127
00:12:09,712 --> 00:12:13,079
Sort of like a three-dimensional version
of that painting.

128
00:12:14,583 --> 00:12:15,948
Is Marcy here?

129
00:12:16,819 --> 00:12:19,879
She had to go out
to the all-night drugstore.

130
00:12:21,424 --> 00:12:23,949
- Is she all right?
- It's under control.

131
00:12:25,361 --> 00:12:26,828
This place is huge.

132
00:12:28,798 --> 00:12:30,766
Do you share it with anyone?

133
00:12:31,467 --> 00:12:33,958
Would you like to work on this for a while?

134
00:12:34,236 --> 00:12:36,227
- I could use a break.
- What?

135
00:12:37,673 --> 00:12:38,935
It's not hard.

136
00:12:41,043 --> 00:12:44,103
What are you talking about? This is yours.

137
00:12:45,648 --> 00:12:48,310
- How would I know what you want?
- Look, it's real easy.

138
00:12:48,384 --> 00:12:51,842
Just take some of this stuff,
and slap it on like this.

139
00:12:53,923 --> 00:12:55,788
All right, I'm coming.

140
00:12:58,994 --> 00:13:00,120
Yeah.

141
00:13:02,364 --> 00:13:04,628
Of course he's here. You invited him.

142
00:13:07,736 --> 00:13:10,330
That's your problem, Marcy.
I'm not gonna tell him.

143
00:13:10,406 --> 00:13:11,896
I'm not telling him.

144
00:13:12,508 --> 00:13:14,339
I can't talk any louder.

145
00:13:15,377 --> 00:13:16,867
All right. Hurry up.

146
00:13:17,413 --> 00:13:19,381
- How's it going?
- It's great.

147
00:13:20,516 --> 00:13:22,507
I'm just giving him a shoulder.

148
00:13:25,087 --> 00:13:27,112
Look what you did to your shirt.

149
00:13:29,058 --> 00:13:30,252
Good.

150
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:34,625
- Give it to me. I'll throw it in the wash.
- It's all right.

151
00:13:35,397 --> 00:13:37,297
It'll only take 20 minutes.

152
00:13:38,601 --> 00:13:40,000
That's okay.

153
00:13:42,705 --> 00:13:43,797
Come on.

154
00:13:44,173 --> 00:13:47,040
You want to look nice
for your big date, don't you?

155
00:13:49,011 --> 00:13:50,342
All right.

156
00:13:53,015 --> 00:13:54,573
Twenty minutes?

157
00:14:01,824 --> 00:14:04,657
- Put this on while you're waiting.
- Thanks.

158
00:14:10,366 --> 00:14:13,665
Do that all day
and your own shoulders get pretty sore.

159
00:14:16,939 --> 00:14:18,406
Want a massage?

160
00:14:19,508 --> 00:14:22,477
- You read my mind. Would you?
- Sure.

161
00:14:24,380 --> 00:14:26,143
I'm not too good at this.

162
00:14:26,515 --> 00:14:28,483
Just know a few basic moves.

163
00:14:29,518 --> 00:14:32,078
Just make it hurt,
and you're on the right track.

164
00:14:32,154 --> 00:14:33,553
That's all I know.

165
00:14:35,991 --> 00:14:37,083
Okay.

166
00:14:46,569 --> 00:14:49,538
- You have a great body.
- Yes.

167
00:14:51,707 --> 00:14:53,174
Not a lot of scars.

168
00:14:55,644 --> 00:14:56,770
That's true.

169
00:14:58,948 --> 00:15:00,381
It never occurred to me.

170
00:15:00,449 --> 00:15:03,748
I mean, some women I know
are covered with them head to toe.

171
00:15:04,286 --> 00:15:05,514
Not me.

172
00:15:07,523 --> 00:15:08,717
Scars?

173
00:15:10,893 --> 00:15:12,622
Horrible, ugly scars.

174
00:15:16,599 --> 00:15:18,328
I'm just telling you, now.

175
00:15:26,041 --> 00:15:27,508
I don't know.

176
00:15:30,245 --> 00:15:32,236
I know when I was a kid...

177
00:15:33,082 --> 00:15:35,414
I'd had my tonsils taken out.

178
00:15:39,154 --> 00:15:40,985
After the operation...

179
00:15:41,056 --> 00:15:43,217
they didn't have enough room
in Pediatrics.

180
00:15:43,292 --> 00:15:45,852
So they had to put me in the burn ward.

181
00:15:48,497 --> 00:15:50,522
But before they wheeled me in...

182
00:15:51,066 --> 00:15:53,899
this nurse gave me...

183
00:15:55,137 --> 00:15:57,230
this blindfold to put on...

184
00:15:57,973 --> 00:16:00,339
and she told me never to take it off.

185
00:16:01,110 --> 00:16:02,509
If I did...

186
00:16:04,113 --> 00:16:06,809
they'd have to do the operation
all over again.

187
00:16:07,683 --> 00:16:12,052
I didn't understand what my tonsils
had to do with my eyes, either.

188
00:16:14,823 --> 00:16:16,313
But anyway...

189
00:16:19,294 --> 00:16:20,761
that night...

190
00:16:21,730 --> 00:16:24,062
at least I think it was night...

191
00:16:25,701 --> 00:16:27,464
I had reached up...

192
00:16:28,570 --> 00:16:30,595
to untie the blindfold...

193
00:16:35,377 --> 00:16:36,844
and I saw...

194
00:17:24,059 --> 00:17:25,549
Hello, again.

195
00:17:25,794 --> 00:17:29,127
- Sorry about this. I was detained.
- Don't worry about it.

196
00:17:29,832 --> 00:17:32,198
- So, how are you?
- Good.

197
00:17:36,105 --> 00:17:39,666
I made it. You wouldn't... I'm here.

198
00:17:42,711 --> 00:17:45,339
Let's go into my room
and get away from all this mess.

199
00:17:45,414 --> 00:17:46,540
Sure.

200
00:17:49,251 --> 00:17:52,220
Your roommate was just dipping all day.

201
00:17:52,755 --> 00:17:54,313
Put me to work.

202
00:17:54,490 --> 00:17:56,685
I feel like a real SoHo artist.

203
00:18:03,932 --> 00:18:05,832
What did you do to her?

204
00:18:08,303 --> 00:18:11,204
I didn't do anything to her.
She was asleep.

205
00:18:11,473 --> 00:18:13,373
I mean, she was tired.

206
00:18:14,543 --> 00:18:18,377
- What do you mean what did I do?
- Easy. It was an innocent question.

207
00:18:19,581 --> 00:18:23,278
Look, I'm going to take a quick shower.
I'll be right back, okay?

208
00:18:24,153 --> 00:18:28,021
Sure. Yeah, I mean, I think a shower
would probably do you good.

209
00:18:28,257 --> 00:18:29,747
You had a tough day.

210
00:18:30,292 --> 00:18:33,261
I knew there was something special
about you.

211
00:18:34,263 --> 00:18:37,198
I hope you don't have to
get up early tomorrow or anything?

212
00:18:37,266 --> 00:18:38,927
No, I don't.

213
00:18:40,903 --> 00:18:43,963
Because I think you're somebody
I can really talk to.

214
00:18:45,340 --> 00:18:47,467
And tonight I feel like...

215
00:18:49,111 --> 00:18:51,841
I feel like I'm going to let loose
or something.

216
00:18:53,615 --> 00:18:57,346
I feel like something incredible
is really going to happen here.

217
00:18:58,153 --> 00:19:01,179
I feel so excited, and I don't know why.

218
00:19:01,924 --> 00:19:03,255
I feel it.

219
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:07,055
I'm glad you came.

220
00:19:08,096 --> 00:19:09,324
Me, too.

221
00:19:12,668 --> 00:19:15,865
Do you want to smoke a joint?
There's some in there, feel free.

222
00:19:15,938 --> 00:19:17,496
No. Maybe later.

223
00:19:52,541 --> 00:19:55,032
- Hello?
- <i>Is Marcy there?</i>

224
00:19:58,213 --> 00:20:02,274
She can't come to the phone right now.
May I take a message?

225
00:20:02,718 --> 00:20:06,119
- <i>Could you just tell her Greg called?</i>
- Sure.

226
00:20:08,457 --> 00:20:09,856
Is she back?

227
00:20:50,265 --> 00:20:52,130
- That felt good.
- Yeah.

228
00:20:55,671 --> 00:20:58,105
- You want me to close the window?
- No, I got it.

229
00:20:58,173 --> 00:21:01,336
Boy! Whoever used to live here
must have been a bodybuilder.

230
00:21:01,410 --> 00:21:02,502
Jesus.

231
00:21:04,980 --> 00:21:07,540
Who's Franklin?
The buzzer when I came over...

232
00:21:07,616 --> 00:21:10,551
Hey, I thought I told you
to stay on the bed.

233
00:21:11,386 --> 00:21:12,580
Right.

234
00:21:16,558 --> 00:21:19,925
I'm gonna ask you to wait here
just one more minute. I promise.

235
00:21:19,995 --> 00:21:22,657
- All right.
- You're the best.

236
00:21:54,963 --> 00:21:57,022
- What, Paul?
- What?

237
00:21:57,432 --> 00:22:00,424
- What did you say?
- I didn't say anything.

238
00:22:02,170 --> 00:22:04,866
You didn't just say something just now?

239
00:22:05,007 --> 00:22:06,998
No, I didn't say anything.

240
00:22:10,078 --> 00:22:13,479
I could have sworn
I thought I heard you say something.

241
00:22:16,585 --> 00:22:17,882
I didn't.

242
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:21,553
I don't think
I'll be able to sleep at all tonight.

243
00:22:21,623 --> 00:22:24,023
What's that smell? Is that linseed?

244
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:28,423
- It's skin moisturizer. I have dry skin.
- Really?

245
00:22:31,666 --> 00:22:33,634
Feels pretty soft to me.

246
00:22:36,004 --> 00:22:37,232
Please.

247
00:22:39,608 --> 00:22:41,405
- What's the matter?
- Nothing.

248
00:22:41,476 --> 00:22:44,741
I think you're very nice.
Could we just talk a little while?

249
00:22:44,813 --> 00:22:47,646
Of course. Sure.

250
00:22:51,853 --> 00:22:53,184
Greg called.

251
00:22:54,456 --> 00:22:57,983
How did that little faggot find out
I was staying here tonight?

252
00:22:58,060 --> 00:23:01,223
Probably wants to whine to me
about his latest boyfriend.

253
00:23:03,331 --> 00:23:06,425
Friends like that
are hard to deal with sometimes.

254
00:23:06,501 --> 00:23:08,366
That's what friends are for.

255
00:23:08,970 --> 00:23:13,168
- I know that, but I meant...
- I just can't deal with it tonight.

256
00:23:14,342 --> 00:23:16,435
Did he want me to call him back?

257
00:23:17,546 --> 00:23:18,808
He didn't say.

258
00:23:24,319 --> 00:23:26,344
Since you answered the phone...

259
00:23:27,389 --> 00:23:29,619
he probably figured I was...

260
00:23:33,128 --> 00:23:34,527
I'm scared.

261
00:23:37,332 --> 00:23:40,062
Why don't you just tell me what's wrong?

262
00:23:45,107 --> 00:23:46,734
I was raped once.

263
00:23:48,276 --> 00:23:51,439
As a matter of fact,
it happened right here in this room.

264
00:23:52,314 --> 00:23:54,009
I lived here once.

265
00:23:56,918 --> 00:23:59,478
He came in through there
off the fire escape.

266
00:24:02,624 --> 00:24:04,956
He held a knife to my throat and said...

267
00:24:05,026 --> 00:24:07,859
if I made any noise
he'd cut my tongue out.

268
00:24:09,531 --> 00:24:11,396
He tied me to the bed.

269
00:24:12,467 --> 00:24:15,630
He took his time. Six hours.

270
00:24:20,775 --> 00:24:22,003
My God.

271
00:24:25,714 --> 00:24:29,616
Was he... Did they get this guy?

272
00:24:31,286 --> 00:24:32,344
No.

273
00:24:35,724 --> 00:24:38,284
Actually it was a boyfriend of mine.

274
00:24:40,762 --> 00:24:43,788
To tell you the truth,
I slept through most of it.

275
00:24:45,967 --> 00:24:48,231
So, there you are.

276
00:25:24,072 --> 00:25:27,041
You want to get some coffee?
I feel like getting out of here.

277
00:25:27,108 --> 00:25:30,544
Absolutely. Is there a place open this late?

278
00:25:30,946 --> 00:25:33,107
Sure. It's not even 2:00 yet.

279
00:26:00,809 --> 00:26:02,003
Ready?

280
00:26:20,695 --> 00:26:24,324
Can I ask you something?
I've wanted to ask you this all night.

281
00:26:24,833 --> 00:26:27,529
- Who's Franklin?
- Franklin?

282
00:26:29,170 --> 00:26:30,797
Franklin is my husband.

283
00:26:32,207 --> 00:26:33,401
Really?

284
00:26:36,978 --> 00:26:39,378
Is that his loft, then?

285
00:26:40,215 --> 00:26:41,739
He owns it, yes.

286
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:48,912
- Do you live with him?
- No. He's in Turkey.

287
00:26:51,726 --> 00:26:55,924
I stayed with my husband for three days.
I was very young when I got married.

288
00:26:57,032 --> 00:26:59,057
My husband was a movie freak.

289
00:27:00,135 --> 00:27:04,538
Actually, he was particularly obsessed
with one movie:

290
00:27:05,774 --> 00:27:07,401
<i>The Wizard of Oz.</i>

291
00:27:08,209 --> 00:27:10,143
He talked about it constantly.

292
00:27:10,445 --> 00:27:12,436
I thought it was cute at first.

293
00:27:15,083 --> 00:27:17,847
On our wedding night, I was a virgin...

294
00:27:20,088 --> 00:27:21,453
when we made love...

295
00:27:21,523 --> 00:27:25,516
- You've seen the film, haven't you?
- <i>The Wizard of Oz?</i> Yeah, I've seen it.

296
00:27:26,761 --> 00:27:28,524
When we made love...

297
00:27:29,064 --> 00:27:30,531
whenever he...

298
00:27:30,832 --> 00:27:32,561
you know, when he came...

299
00:27:33,001 --> 00:27:37,165
he would just scream out,
"Surrender, Dorothy!"

300
00:27:38,773 --> 00:27:41,674
That's all. Just, "Surrender, Dorothy!"

301
00:27:42,677 --> 00:27:44,201
- Wow.
- I know.

302
00:27:44,279 --> 00:27:48,147
Instead of moaning or saying, "Oh, God,"
or something normal like that.

303
00:27:48,383 --> 00:27:52,183
It was pretty creepy.
I told him I thought so...

304
00:27:52,821 --> 00:27:55,619
but he just couldn't stop.

305
00:28:02,931 --> 00:28:05,525
He said he didn't even realize
it was happening.

306
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:07,192
He just couldn't stop.

307
00:28:07,635 --> 00:28:10,103
So I just broke the whole thing off.

308
00:28:16,878 --> 00:28:21,577
Sorry. I guess I'm really putting you
through the mill tonight.

309
00:28:21,983 --> 00:28:24,008
It's okay. I'm used to it.

310
00:28:25,754 --> 00:28:28,382
You know, I still love him very much.

311
00:28:30,258 --> 00:28:32,988
In fact, we write each other every day.

312
00:28:34,863 --> 00:28:37,661
Naturally, I don't like to talk about it.

313
00:28:40,969 --> 00:28:43,938
- Could we have the check?
- It's on the house.

314
00:28:44,272 --> 00:28:45,864
- Really?
- Sure. What the hell.

315
00:28:45,940 --> 00:28:49,899
Different rules apply this late.
Know what I mean? It's like after hours.

316
00:28:51,346 --> 00:28:54,179
- Thanks, Peter.
- Sure, Marcy. Have a good evening.

317
00:29:36,057 --> 00:29:37,786
It's okay. It's...

318
00:29:42,997 --> 00:29:44,794
Do you want me to go?

319
00:30:09,724 --> 00:30:11,453
...the pill makes me sick.

320
00:30:11,526 --> 00:30:14,256
Everything makes you sick, Marcy.

321
00:30:17,932 --> 00:30:19,866
The guys gave it to me.

322
00:30:26,541 --> 00:30:27,906
Oh, my...

323
00:30:30,678 --> 00:30:31,770
God!

324
00:30:48,096 --> 00:30:49,529
Here we are.

325
00:31:00,141 --> 00:31:02,974
- So, how about that joint?
- Yeah.

326
00:31:04,579 --> 00:31:06,103
- Good idea.
- Great.

327
00:31:37,412 --> 00:31:39,175
What type of pot is this?

328
00:31:40,214 --> 00:31:41,647
It's Colombian.

329
00:31:43,051 --> 00:31:44,985
- That's a lie.
- What?

330
00:31:46,888 --> 00:31:50,016
This isn't Colombian.
I don't even think it's pot.

331
00:31:51,893 --> 00:31:54,123
That's what the guy
who sold it to me said it was.

332
00:31:54,195 --> 00:31:58,393
The guy who sold it to you is a liar.
So are you. That's shit.

333
00:31:59,867 --> 00:32:02,961
Don't get upset.
I just won't buy it from him anymore.

334
00:32:03,037 --> 00:32:04,402
That's horseshit.

335
00:32:05,673 --> 00:32:07,072
Are you all right?

336
00:32:07,141 --> 00:32:09,735
Where are those plaster-of-Paris
paperweights, anyway?

337
00:32:09,811 --> 00:32:11,904
That's what I came down here for.

338
00:32:11,980 --> 00:32:14,244
That's not entirely true.
I came to see you...

339
00:32:14,315 --> 00:32:17,614
but where are the paperweights?
That's what I wanna see now.

340
00:32:18,987 --> 00:32:22,013
- What's the matter?
- I said I wanna see a plaster-of-Paris...

341
00:32:22,090 --> 00:32:24,991
bagel-and-cream-cheese paperweight.
Now cough it up.

342
00:32:25,226 --> 00:32:27,160
- Right now?
- Yes, right now.

343
00:32:28,463 --> 00:32:29,896
They're in Kiki's bedroom.

344
00:32:29,964 --> 00:32:32,194
Then get them. As we sit here chatting...

345
00:32:32,266 --> 00:32:35,258
there are important papers
flying rampant around my apartment...

346
00:32:35,336 --> 00:32:38,237
'cause I don't have anything
to hold them down with.

347
00:32:39,540 --> 00:32:40,666
Fine.

348
00:32:46,547 --> 00:32:48,310
I don't know, Kiki.

349
00:32:54,789 --> 00:32:56,416
Sorry about that.

350
00:33:18,012 --> 00:33:21,038
- It's really coming down, huh?
- You bet.

351
00:33:21,716 --> 00:33:22,944
Here you go.

352
00:33:23,017 --> 00:33:25,383
- The fare is $1.50.
- What?

353
00:33:25,853 --> 00:33:28,515
Fare went up to $1.50 as of midnight.

354
00:33:30,358 --> 00:33:31,882
You're kidding.

355
00:33:34,062 --> 00:33:35,290
Look...

356
00:33:37,131 --> 00:33:39,565
- I've got 97 cents.
- No.

357
00:33:41,102 --> 00:33:43,627
- It's raining like mad out there.
- No.

358
00:33:44,305 --> 00:33:47,365
Would you just give me a break?
I really just wanna go home.

359
00:33:47,442 --> 00:33:50,411
I'm sorry, I can't do that.
I could lose my job.

360
00:33:52,313 --> 00:33:54,338
Who would know, exactly?

361
00:33:54,549 --> 00:33:58,986
I could go to a party, get drunk,
talk to someone. Who knows?

362
00:33:59,454 --> 00:34:01,115
Would you just give me a goddamn token?

363
00:34:01,189 --> 00:34:04,488
No, goddamn it! I cannot give you a token.
Those tokens are $1.50.

364
00:34:04,559 --> 00:34:07,357
I can't sell for 97 cents.
We'd lose money that way.

365
00:34:07,428 --> 00:34:09,919
There's the train! Come on!
Give me a token!

366
00:34:18,573 --> 00:34:21,770
- Can I help you?
- I wanted to take the Express...

367
00:34:22,210 --> 00:34:23,472
Get away from me!

368
00:34:23,544 --> 00:34:26,638
- I'm talking to you.
- I know. I'm sorry.

369
00:34:26,948 --> 00:34:29,974
I've never done that in my life.
I don't know what came over me.

370
00:34:30,051 --> 00:34:32,042
The fares went up and I have 97 cents.

371
00:34:32,120 --> 00:34:35,214
I won't even take the train. I'm sorry.

372
00:34:36,190 --> 00:34:37,680
That's not my train.

373
00:34:37,759 --> 00:34:39,989
That's the one I wanted. Thanks a lot.

374
00:34:42,463 --> 00:34:44,328
Must be a full moon out there.

375
00:35:54,235 --> 00:35:55,930
Can I get you something?

376
00:35:56,537 --> 00:35:58,095
I have 97 cents.

377
00:36:00,575 --> 00:36:04,443
- It's not very much, is it?
- No, it's not.

378
00:36:06,681 --> 00:36:10,549
Do I have to order something?
I mean, can I just sit here for a minute?

379
00:36:13,154 --> 00:36:15,486
- Yes. Sure.
- Thanks.

380
00:36:15,623 --> 00:36:16,920
Anytime.

381
00:37:55,256 --> 00:37:56,746
What'll it be?

382
00:37:59,593 --> 00:38:02,391
I don't want anything.
I just want to sit here.

383
00:38:02,530 --> 00:38:04,862
- Is that okay?
- Sure.

384
00:38:05,232 --> 00:38:06,290
Thanks.

385
00:38:06,367 --> 00:38:09,894
But if you're looking to make friends,
don't get your hopes up.

386
00:38:09,971 --> 00:38:12,269
Looks like a pretty slow night.

387
00:38:14,375 --> 00:38:15,535
Yeah.

388
00:38:17,111 --> 00:38:18,408
It is late.

389
00:38:18,479 --> 00:38:21,971
Not for this place.
Things are usually hopping around now.

390
00:38:22,383 --> 00:38:25,819
That's all right.
I just want to get in out of the rain.

391
00:38:26,354 --> 00:38:28,822
I just hope it lets up soon.

392
00:38:30,958 --> 00:38:32,858
I really just want to go home.

393
00:38:33,027 --> 00:38:34,824
Aren't the subways running?

394
00:38:36,497 --> 00:38:38,863
But I happen to be broke at the moment.

395
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:42,391
Christ. I'll give you the money.

396
00:38:42,703 --> 00:38:46,161
Really? I can't tell you
how much that would mean to me.

397
00:38:48,242 --> 00:38:51,405
- Christ! Not another one.
- Another what?

398
00:38:52,947 --> 00:38:56,713
The guy lives in the same building as me.
He's been here three times tonight...

399
00:38:56,784 --> 00:39:00,720
to tell me about three separate burglaries
in this neighborhood, all tonight.

400
00:39:00,788 --> 00:39:02,619
- Shit!
- What?

401
00:39:03,090 --> 00:39:04,216
What?

402
00:39:04,492 --> 00:39:08,189
I'm just trying to remember if I turned
my burglar alarm on at home tonight.

403
00:39:08,262 --> 00:39:09,729
Sometimes I forget.

404
00:39:10,331 --> 00:39:11,958
Oh, well, anyway.

405
00:39:30,151 --> 00:39:31,709
It's all right.

406
00:39:32,553 --> 00:39:35,283
That's all right. Forget it. Doesn't matter.

407
00:39:35,356 --> 00:39:38,120
No. I'd like to open the register.
What if I got a rush now?

408
00:39:38,192 --> 00:39:42,219
Yeah, I see your point. What about a key?
Do you have a key for that?

409
00:39:42,296 --> 00:39:46,164
- Yeah. But I keep it up in my apartment.
- Damn. That's too bad.

410
00:39:48,436 --> 00:39:51,735
I can't go anywhere,
but how would you like to do me a favor?

411
00:39:51,806 --> 00:39:53,467
- For subway fare?
- Lf you don't mind.

412
00:39:53,541 --> 00:39:57,341
- You got it.
- I'm at 158 Spring Street, top floor. Wait.

413
00:39:58,079 --> 00:39:59,671
What am I doing?

414
00:40:00,981 --> 00:40:02,175
Right.

415
00:40:03,150 --> 00:40:05,448
You don't know me. I don't know you.

416
00:40:05,519 --> 00:40:08,682
I might rip you off, right?
Is that what you're thinking?

417
00:40:10,458 --> 00:40:13,154
I'm not gonna rip you off. I'm not.

418
00:40:13,227 --> 00:40:15,092
With what I've been through tonight...

419
00:40:15,162 --> 00:40:18,154
the last thing I want to do
is steal from somebody.

420
00:40:18,466 --> 00:40:20,661
I really just want to get home.

421
00:40:21,202 --> 00:40:22,533
Look, here.

422
00:40:22,670 --> 00:40:25,434
Here are my keys.
This is my deposit, okay?

423
00:40:25,506 --> 00:40:29,169
If I don't come back, these are yours.
Everything I own is yours.

424
00:40:29,243 --> 00:40:32,110
I just want to get home. Keep them.

425
00:40:34,815 --> 00:40:37,545
Okay. All right. Good. Here.

426
00:40:39,186 --> 00:40:42,451
The keys for the register
are over the light switch, on a hook.

427
00:40:42,523 --> 00:40:44,923
The alarm is underneath the light switch.

428
00:40:44,992 --> 00:40:46,983
Make sure you see a beeping red light.

429
00:40:47,061 --> 00:40:49,859
- Beeping red light. 158 Spring.
- Top floor.

430
00:40:49,930 --> 00:40:51,693
I'll be right back.

431
00:41:48,822 --> 00:41:49,846
No.

432
00:41:51,559 --> 00:41:52,651
God.

433
00:41:53,894 --> 00:41:55,088
Jesus!

434
00:41:57,298 --> 00:41:58,458
What's come from Phil?

435
00:41:58,532 --> 00:42:02,298
I don't wanna read it. I'm jealous.
He even sounded tanned on the phone.

436
00:42:02,369 --> 00:42:04,963
I wonder if this is
our local friendly burglar.

437
00:42:05,039 --> 00:42:08,304
Did you get what you wanted
or did we get back and spoil your fun?

438
00:42:08,375 --> 00:42:12,004
- Who are you? You don't live here.
- I'm a friend of Tom's.

439
00:42:12,079 --> 00:42:14,445
Tom who?
There are three Toms living here.

440
00:42:14,515 --> 00:42:17,382
Look, guys, I'm not a burglar.
So get your hands off me.

441
00:42:17,451 --> 00:42:18,816
He asked you which Tom.

442
00:42:18,886 --> 00:42:21,286
I don't know Tom's last name.
He's on the top floor.

443
00:42:21,355 --> 00:42:23,915
- How many Toms are on the top floor?
- How did you get in?

444
00:42:23,991 --> 00:42:26,516
He gave me the keys. Look. See this?

445
00:42:26,627 --> 00:42:29,061
He gave me the keys and I let myself in.

446
00:42:29,697 --> 00:42:33,360
Sorry, but there have been
about eight break-ins here just last week.

447
00:42:33,434 --> 00:42:38,030
Okay, I'm sorry, all right.
I didn't know that.

448
00:42:39,373 --> 00:42:41,603
We're gonna hit Radio Shack
tonight, man?

449
00:42:41,675 --> 00:42:44,337
Wait till next week.
That's when the new models come in.

450
00:42:44,411 --> 00:42:46,208
Hey, where did you get that?

451
00:43:18,212 --> 00:43:20,203
Kiki! God, what happened?

452
00:43:21,315 --> 00:43:24,307
Just throw down the keys.
Throw it. Be careful.

453
00:43:26,353 --> 00:43:29,516
That's right. Give it a good throw.
There you go.

454
00:43:38,932 --> 00:43:40,456
Hold on, Kiki.

455
00:43:42,102 --> 00:43:43,228
Shit!

456
00:43:45,306 --> 00:43:49,470
What have they done?
What are these guys, sailors?

457
00:43:49,543 --> 00:43:53,479
Look at this work. It's so elaborate.
Must've taken them hours.

458
00:43:53,881 --> 00:43:56,543
- How'd they get in?
- How did who get in?

459
00:43:56,750 --> 00:43:59,776
- The burglars.
- The burglars? What burglars?

460
00:44:00,254 --> 00:44:02,381
The ones that took your sculpture
and your TV set.

461
00:44:03,657 --> 00:44:04,624
God.

462
00:44:06,994 --> 00:44:08,689
- Neil and Pepe?
- Who?

463
00:44:08,762 --> 00:44:11,026
It was Neil and Pepe.
They're friends of mine.

464
00:44:11,098 --> 00:44:13,498
I just sold them my television for $300.

465
00:44:13,600 --> 00:44:15,932
How did you get ahold of my sculpture?

466
00:44:29,149 --> 00:44:31,310
- This the guy?
- Yeah.

467
00:44:33,220 --> 00:44:34,585
I'm Horst.

468
00:44:36,190 --> 00:44:38,624
I'm Paul. Hi.

469
00:44:48,635 --> 00:44:51,001
That was rude of you before, Paul.

470
00:44:52,106 --> 00:44:54,597
You really ought to be
ashamed of yourself.

471
00:44:55,042 --> 00:44:56,168
I am.

472
00:44:58,078 --> 00:45:00,706
I don't know what could have
come over me.

473
00:45:02,516 --> 00:45:05,849
- Lack of discipline.
- Possibly.

474
00:45:07,721 --> 00:45:10,815
It's not too late to finish what you started.

475
00:45:11,325 --> 00:45:14,089
Marcy, it's Paul.

476
00:45:23,170 --> 00:45:24,194
Hi.

477
00:45:27,808 --> 00:45:29,833
Listen, I owe you an apology.

478
00:45:31,445 --> 00:45:35,074
There's just no excuse
for leaving the way I did. I'm sorry.

479
00:45:36,016 --> 00:45:37,643
I just figured...

480
00:45:39,286 --> 00:45:41,811
it's not working out between us, and...

481
00:45:41,889 --> 00:45:45,290
hell, I'll never see you again.
There's just no excuse.

482
00:45:47,561 --> 00:45:50,291
I think I just got a little spooked,
you know...

483
00:45:50,831 --> 00:45:54,858
with that story
about your husband and your boyfriend.

484
00:45:54,935 --> 00:45:56,869
I mean, that was really weird.

485
00:45:57,237 --> 00:45:58,932
What was that all about?

486
00:46:00,340 --> 00:46:04,071
And, I gathered there's something...

487
00:46:06,113 --> 00:46:09,378
wrong, or you have
some burns or something...

488
00:46:09,550 --> 00:46:11,814
and I just couldn't handle that.

489
00:46:12,152 --> 00:46:14,916
I'm sorry.
I don't know what happened to me.

490
00:46:17,558 --> 00:46:20,959
I don't know. Maybe the timing's
just off or something, but...

491
00:46:24,898 --> 00:46:26,923
I think I just better go.

492
00:46:29,069 --> 00:46:30,058
Okay?

493
00:46:32,473 --> 00:46:33,667
Marcy?

494
00:46:38,912 --> 00:46:40,072
What...

495
00:46:46,620 --> 00:46:48,212
Jesus! Marcy.

496
00:46:49,490 --> 00:46:52,118
God! Breathe.

497
00:46:52,392 --> 00:46:55,452
Kiki! Come on!

498
00:46:57,664 --> 00:46:58,858
Jesus!

499
00:47:04,204 --> 00:47:05,296
God!

500
00:47:06,306 --> 00:47:07,466
Think.

501
00:47:13,514 --> 00:47:15,482
Kiki! Horst!

502
00:47:17,885 --> 00:47:21,218
<i>"Paul and Marcy,</i>
<i>Horst and I went to Club Berlin for drinks.</i>

503
00:47:21,288 --> 00:47:24,223
<i>"Join us if you feel up to it.</i>
<i>Corner W. Broadway and Grand.</i>

504
00:47:24,291 --> 00:47:25,622
<i>"See ya! Kiki."</i>

505
00:47:25,692 --> 00:47:26,818
Shit.

506
00:47:29,863 --> 00:47:31,763
Operator, give me the police.

507
00:47:32,165 --> 00:47:34,099
Yes. I want to report a death.

508
00:47:41,008 --> 00:47:42,100
God.

509
00:48:37,497 --> 00:48:38,623
Oh, no!

510
00:49:15,802 --> 00:49:19,169
It's me. I did it. I quit my job.

511
00:49:19,239 --> 00:49:20,729
What do you want me to do about it?

512
00:49:20,807 --> 00:49:23,537
Let's go have a drink.
Let's celebrate. Pier Three is open.

513
00:49:23,610 --> 00:49:25,510
I don't know what your problem is...

514
00:49:25,579 --> 00:49:29,845
but I've got to get over that bar,
get my keys, so I can get home.

515
00:49:33,754 --> 00:49:34,914
Look at this.

516
00:49:38,258 --> 00:49:39,486
Now what?

517
00:49:39,960 --> 00:49:42,258
This is incredible.

518
00:49:43,296 --> 00:49:45,093
Where the hell is he?

519
00:49:46,166 --> 00:49:49,499
I live across the street.
Would you like a TV dinner?

520
00:49:52,739 --> 00:49:56,937
Wait a minute! Neil! Pepe!
Wait a minute! I didn't know!

521
00:49:57,010 --> 00:49:59,444
Speed up. It's that dude again.
Get out of here.

522
00:49:59,513 --> 00:50:03,040
I didn't know.

523
00:50:07,154 --> 00:50:08,781
I've had enough, God.

524
00:50:09,890 --> 00:50:11,152
My place?

525
00:50:14,795 --> 00:50:16,558
You like The Monkees?

526
00:50:20,600 --> 00:50:21,999
What's your name?

527
00:50:22,536 --> 00:50:23,696
Julie.

528
00:50:32,012 --> 00:50:33,274
I'm Paul.

529
00:50:33,513 --> 00:50:35,003
Rough night, Paul?

530
00:50:35,916 --> 00:50:37,645
You look depressed.

531
00:50:38,852 --> 00:50:41,844
I came downtown tonight...

532
00:50:43,824 --> 00:50:45,291
Oh, God.

533
00:50:46,059 --> 00:50:48,857
I didn't even know this girl.

534
00:50:55,202 --> 00:50:56,692
Oh, God.

535
00:50:59,806 --> 00:51:01,398
I didn't even know her.

536
00:51:01,475 --> 00:51:02,772
Hang on.

537
00:51:07,214 --> 00:51:08,738
Is that better?

538
00:51:10,150 --> 00:51:11,708
<i>Chelsea Morning.</i>

539
00:51:14,588 --> 00:51:16,818
Go on. What is it? Talk to me.

540
00:51:17,924 --> 00:51:22,020
I'm fine, really. I'm just going to be
out of your way in just a sec.

541
00:51:22,929 --> 00:51:25,989
I'm just waiting for them
to open up downstairs.

542
00:51:26,199 --> 00:51:29,066
I'll just get my keys and go home.

543
00:51:30,537 --> 00:51:32,004
Boy, oh, boy.

544
00:51:36,243 --> 00:51:38,768
Just let it go, honey.
Tell me your problems.

545
00:51:41,081 --> 00:51:42,309
I don't think so.

546
00:51:42,382 --> 00:51:45,715
Paul, lighten up. What is this?

547
00:51:45,919 --> 00:51:49,912
This doom and gloom and...
Be loosey-goosey. Come on.

548
00:51:51,925 --> 00:51:55,486
- What are you talking about?
- Come on, tell me your problems.

549
00:51:56,062 --> 00:51:58,963
Where the hell is he? What time is it?

550
00:51:59,032 --> 00:52:00,260
It's very late.

551
00:52:04,671 --> 00:52:05,763
Jesus.

552
00:52:09,976 --> 00:52:12,672
So, you really hate that job?

553
00:52:13,180 --> 00:52:15,978
Yeah. I hate both my jobs.

554
00:52:16,316 --> 00:52:18,045
Yeah? What else do you do?

555
00:52:19,052 --> 00:52:21,612
I work in the Xerox shop downstairs.

556
00:52:23,123 --> 00:52:24,590
Downstairs?

557
00:52:24,658 --> 00:52:26,888
Yeah. We're right on top of it.

558
00:52:27,427 --> 00:52:29,827
I've got the keys.
You want to go down and see it?

559
00:52:29,896 --> 00:52:33,730
No, thanks. I've had
about enough excitement for one night.

560
00:52:33,800 --> 00:52:35,734
It's a lousy job, but...

561
00:52:36,203 --> 00:52:38,865
I can get free copies whenever I want to.

562
00:52:38,939 --> 00:52:40,201
Gee whiz.

563
00:52:41,007 --> 00:52:43,703
What is that, "Gee whiz"?

564
00:52:43,777 --> 00:52:45,768
I mean, you're humoring me?

565
00:52:47,047 --> 00:52:50,278
I don't have to take that kind of shit.
What is it with people today?

566
00:52:50,350 --> 00:52:52,784
You can't say anything
without getting a smart answer.

567
00:52:52,853 --> 00:52:55,822
You have to be so goddamn careful
about everything you say.

568
00:52:55,889 --> 00:52:58,323
You think I don't notice?
I know what's going on.

569
00:52:58,391 --> 00:53:02,020
I overhear the customers
at the Xerox shop making fun of me.

570
00:53:02,095 --> 00:53:03,426
I didn't mean anything by that.

571
00:53:03,496 --> 00:53:07,660
It was raining outside,
and I invited you to come into my home.

572
00:53:07,734 --> 00:53:09,759
I didn't have to do that, now, did I?

573
00:53:09,836 --> 00:53:11,463
First of all, you're not stupid.

574
00:53:11,538 --> 00:53:15,030
Look, I have trouble figuring out
the tax on checks. So what?

575
00:53:15,108 --> 00:53:17,338
I mean, 8%% % is a bitch!

576
00:53:17,410 --> 00:53:21,574
So I make a few mistakes.
Sue me! Call your lawyers!

577
00:53:21,781 --> 00:53:24,648
Okay, come on. I'm sorry. I didn't mean it.

578
00:53:30,991 --> 00:53:33,357
- You want to sit down?
- Okay.

579
00:53:37,664 --> 00:53:40,132
I'm sorry I was rude before. I really am.

580
00:53:41,234 --> 00:53:43,429
Okay, no more crying. Please.

581
00:53:45,405 --> 00:53:46,872
What a night.

582
00:53:48,875 --> 00:53:49,933
Paul?

583
00:53:52,812 --> 00:53:54,609
Do you like my hairdo?

584
00:54:02,389 --> 00:54:04,983
Yes, I do.

585
00:54:06,059 --> 00:54:07,959
Then why don't you touch it?

586
00:54:11,998 --> 00:54:14,728
- I don't want to mess it up.
- You won't.

587
00:54:18,004 --> 00:54:19,665
- You want me to?
- Yeah.

588
00:54:22,142 --> 00:54:23,234
Okay.

589
00:54:30,183 --> 00:54:34,085
That's him. I hear him. No, it's okay.

590
00:54:34,154 --> 00:54:36,782
Thank God he's there. I can go home.

591
00:54:38,358 --> 00:54:39,757
What's the matter?

592
00:54:41,761 --> 00:54:43,661
Nothing. I just...

593
00:54:45,665 --> 00:54:50,568
You know, I really got the feeling
that you kind of liked me.

594
00:54:53,473 --> 00:54:57,739
You're not going to leave, not after
I brought you out of the rain, are you?

595
00:54:59,546 --> 00:55:02,037
All right. I'm going to...

596
00:55:03,616 --> 00:55:05,743
Here's what I'll do. I'll...

597
00:55:06,553 --> 00:55:10,080
go to the bar,
give your boss back his keys.

598
00:55:10,790 --> 00:55:13,884
I'm going to get my keys
and I'll be back, okay?

599
00:55:14,494 --> 00:55:16,985
- Should take all of two minutes.
- Yeah, sure.

600
00:55:17,063 --> 00:55:20,726
Julie, two minutes. Okay?

601
00:55:28,008 --> 00:55:30,067
Well, what happened to you?

602
00:55:30,543 --> 00:55:32,408
Long, difficult story.

603
00:55:32,712 --> 00:55:36,876
Honestly, when you didn't show up
for so long, I figured you did rob me blind.

604
00:55:36,950 --> 00:55:41,216
I had to close up here and check it out.
My neighbor told me he did see you leave.

605
00:55:41,287 --> 00:55:44,051
But he wasn't too sure about you, either.

606
00:55:44,257 --> 00:55:45,849
But here you are.

607
00:55:47,293 --> 00:55:49,284
I tell you, you had me worried.

608
00:55:50,997 --> 00:55:54,262
How about a drink?
You look like you could use one.

609
00:55:56,436 --> 00:56:00,236
You don't happen to have any
powerful aphrodisiacs back there, do you?

610
00:56:01,007 --> 00:56:02,736
She won't put out?

611
00:56:02,809 --> 00:56:04,572
It's not for her. It's for me.

612
00:56:05,879 --> 00:56:08,814
I seem to have gotten myself
involved with...

613
00:56:09,482 --> 00:56:11,245
one of your cocktail waitresses.

614
00:56:11,317 --> 00:56:14,684
- Miss Beehive, 1965.
- Yes.

615
00:56:16,856 --> 00:56:18,414
Don't even ask me how.

616
00:56:19,025 --> 00:56:21,721
Take off. What's she going to do,
kill herself?

617
00:56:24,764 --> 00:56:25,992
Terminal.

618
00:56:28,134 --> 00:56:29,726
What's up, Rich?

619
00:56:47,754 --> 00:56:51,690
You know, you're right.
Just give me my keys. I'm gonna go home.

620
00:57:05,038 --> 00:57:06,437
What's the matter?

621
00:57:13,213 --> 00:57:14,737
My girlfriend...

622
00:57:16,950 --> 00:57:19,748
just killed herself a little while ago.

623
00:57:20,987 --> 00:57:23,353
- Took some sleeping pills.
- Jesus Christ.

624
00:57:23,423 --> 00:57:25,687
- Oh, no.
- Yep.

625
00:57:28,128 --> 00:57:32,064
We had an argument. I told her
she had to get out of the apartment...

626
00:57:35,768 --> 00:57:37,099
It's my fault.

627
00:57:38,238 --> 00:57:39,296
God.

628
00:57:40,039 --> 00:57:41,973
Marcy.

629
00:58:05,398 --> 00:58:07,923
I don't know what to say. I just...

630
00:58:09,502 --> 00:58:12,630
What can you say?
After all, it wasn't your fault.

631
00:58:17,277 --> 00:58:21,213
I'm going to...
I'll be right back, okay? Try to stay calm.

632
00:58:33,092 --> 00:58:35,287
- Are you all right?
- Why, yes.

633
00:58:37,263 --> 00:58:40,721
- You said two minutes, though.
- I know.

634
00:58:41,401 --> 00:58:44,063
- I'm sorry.
- Did you miss me?

635
00:58:45,071 --> 00:58:48,802
Like I've never missed anyone in
my whole life, is how much I missed you.

636
00:58:48,875 --> 00:58:51,867
- Really?
- I can't believe how much I missed you.

637
00:58:53,012 --> 00:58:55,674
- I really did miss you.
- That's very sweet.

638
00:59:02,255 --> 00:59:03,950
I'm going to give you a present.

639
00:59:04,023 --> 00:59:07,220
Don't do that.
That's really not necessary at all.

640
00:59:07,560 --> 00:59:10,620
I've only known you an hour.

641
00:59:10,697 --> 00:59:14,394
No. You said that you were going to
come back, and you did.

642
00:59:15,535 --> 00:59:18,595
In these days,
that is something to be commended...

643
00:59:18,671 --> 00:59:20,400
and rewarded.

644
00:59:26,379 --> 00:59:28,939
- Do you know what this is?
- No.

645
00:59:33,182 --> 00:59:36,743
This is a plaster-of-Paris,
bagel-and-cream-cheese paperweight.

646
00:59:37,519 --> 00:59:41,455
I bought it from a local artist, Kiki Bridges.
Did you ever hear of her?

647
00:59:42,091 --> 00:59:43,388
Julie.

648
00:59:45,327 --> 00:59:47,852
I promised I would come back, and I did.

649
00:59:48,430 --> 00:59:50,830
Now, I really do have to go.

650
00:59:51,333 --> 00:59:54,097
I got to sleep. You understand, don't you?

651
00:59:54,169 --> 00:59:56,535
I promise I'm going to see you again.

652
00:59:56,605 --> 00:59:59,199
I will. Okay?

653
01:00:01,910 --> 01:00:03,241
You all right?

654
01:00:03,312 --> 01:00:07,146
Why do you keep asking me that?
What's with you? Are you nuts?

655
01:00:08,317 --> 01:00:11,218
Let's exchange phone numbers.
Want to do that?

656
01:00:11,754 --> 01:00:13,312
- Phone numbers?
- Yeah, come on.

657
01:00:13,389 --> 01:00:18,292
It's a great idea. I'll write it on this.
What's your number?

658
01:00:18,827 --> 01:00:22,957
My number is 5-4433.
Very easy to remember.

659
01:00:23,031 --> 01:00:25,556
5-4433.

660
01:00:25,834 --> 01:00:28,325
That's not enough numbers, but okay.

661
01:00:28,404 --> 01:00:30,338
5-4433.

662
01:00:30,939 --> 01:00:33,965
- Okay.
- No. KL 5-4433.

663
01:00:34,042 --> 01:00:36,602
I'm sorry. Okay.

664
01:00:41,884 --> 01:00:44,284
- Oh, God.
- Wait.

665
01:00:44,353 --> 01:00:47,015
Get that away from me. Jesus!

666
01:00:47,322 --> 01:00:48,619
Oh, really?

667
01:00:50,359 --> 01:00:53,624
You're going to be sorry for this
because I am going to get you.

668
01:00:56,632 --> 01:00:59,123
You're kidding me. Not again.

669
01:01:00,602 --> 01:01:02,297
What is this?

670
01:01:15,317 --> 01:01:18,548
Let's knock off for tonight.
My back's killing me.

671
01:01:18,620 --> 01:01:22,989
Let's look for my statue, man.
It's got to be around here someplace.

672
01:01:24,660 --> 01:01:28,721
It makes me sick. That statue
was the first thing in my life I ever bought.

673
01:01:30,265 --> 01:01:34,827
See what happens when you pay for stuff?
Somebody rips it off. Shit.

674
01:01:37,673 --> 01:01:41,575
It's got to be around here someplace, man.
Let's cruise down Mercer Street.

675
01:01:59,628 --> 01:02:01,152
Tom, it's Paul.

676
01:02:06,568 --> 01:02:10,095
I was afraid to go in because
you don't want to confront one of them.

677
01:02:10,172 --> 01:02:12,834
Some of them are drugged up...

678
01:02:15,043 --> 01:02:16,271
I wasn't out an hour.

679
01:02:16,345 --> 01:02:20,805
I come in, the cameras are gone,
the lenses are gone, the whole thing...

680
01:02:20,883 --> 01:02:24,683
- Did you call your insurance agent?
- I don't have insurance, besides...

681
01:02:25,554 --> 01:02:26,816
It's that guy again.

682
01:02:28,323 --> 01:02:30,257
Don't let him get away.

683
01:02:33,896 --> 01:02:36,421
Let's go this way. Maybe that's him.

684
01:02:40,335 --> 01:02:44,066
Come on, get your grubby face
out of here. Get out.

685
01:02:45,140 --> 01:02:48,200
- Fella, where you going?
- Restroom?

686
01:02:48,677 --> 01:02:52,613
Did you come just to use the bathroom?
The bathroom's for customers only.

687
01:02:52,681 --> 01:02:56,412
I'm going to order something, really.
I just want to use the bathroom, okay?

688
01:02:56,485 --> 01:02:58,214
Didn't you hear me?

689
01:02:58,287 --> 01:03:01,779
Come on, get out of here and stay out.

690
01:03:19,107 --> 01:03:21,974
Menu's on the table.
Make yourself comfortable.

691
01:03:22,044 --> 01:03:23,841
I set it up for you.

692
01:03:25,647 --> 01:03:27,137
Thank you.

693
01:03:36,592 --> 01:03:40,358
<i>"Paul and Marcy,</i>
<i>Horst and I went to Club Berlin for drinks. "</i>

694
01:03:42,064 --> 01:03:45,522
I'm just going to go put a quarter
in the meter at my car.

695
01:03:46,868 --> 01:03:51,305
Let's see.
I'll have a burger, medium rare, coffee.

696
01:04:07,789 --> 01:04:09,154
May I enter?

697
01:04:09,224 --> 01:04:11,317
I can't let you in at the moment.

698
01:04:13,795 --> 01:04:16,389
Will it be possible to be admitted...

699
01:04:16,698 --> 01:04:19,132
at a more convenient time for the club?

700
01:04:19,201 --> 01:04:21,692
It is possible, but not at the moment.

701
01:04:24,506 --> 01:04:25,564
God.

702
01:04:27,509 --> 01:04:30,842
If you're so drawn to it,
try and force your way in.

703
01:04:35,550 --> 01:04:36,983
Got any money?

704
01:04:37,886 --> 01:04:40,787
Yes, I have money.
Is that what you want? Money?

705
01:04:40,856 --> 01:04:43,450
Why didn't you just ask that
in the first place, man?

706
01:04:43,525 --> 01:04:46,016
Here, it's not much. But it's all I've got.

707
01:04:46,094 --> 01:04:48,562
I'll take your money
'cause I don't want you to feel...

708
01:04:48,630 --> 01:04:51,724
you left anything untried.
You keep the quarter.

709
01:04:52,401 --> 01:04:54,460
You still have to wait a few minutes.

710
01:04:54,536 --> 01:04:55,798
Hey, mutt.

711
01:05:00,609 --> 01:05:02,406
Why doesn't he have to wait
a few minutes?

712
01:05:02,477 --> 01:05:06,140
Tonight is Mohawk night.
If you had a Mohawk, you could go in.

713
01:05:09,217 --> 01:05:11,845
Come on. We're both adults.

714
01:05:13,321 --> 01:05:15,482
Why don't you just let me in?

715
01:05:16,191 --> 01:05:17,818
Do you really want to go inside?

716
01:05:17,893 --> 01:05:21,021
It's very important. I've got people in there
who are expecting me.

717
01:05:21,096 --> 01:05:23,087
Why don't you let me in?

718
01:05:24,366 --> 01:05:25,731
You're sure?

719
01:05:27,202 --> 01:05:28,931
Yes, I'm sure.

720
01:05:33,809 --> 01:05:35,834
Coming through.

721
01:05:37,179 --> 01:05:39,579
- To your left and straight ahead.
- What?

722
01:05:39,648 --> 01:05:42,481
Right through there. It's straight there.

723
01:06:04,539 --> 01:06:07,007
- Mohawk this guy.
- With pleasure.

724
01:06:11,446 --> 01:06:15,041
Kiki! Horst!

725
01:06:19,020 --> 01:06:22,581
Marcy's dead! Neil and Pepe are crooks!

726
01:06:22,657 --> 01:06:25,649
I'm broke! Help!

727
01:06:25,727 --> 01:06:28,457
No! Don't!

728
01:06:43,912 --> 01:06:45,903
God, what have they done to me?

729
01:06:47,115 --> 01:06:49,242
God. I'll kill those barbarians.

730
01:06:52,053 --> 01:06:54,817
Bald. God! Get me a gun.

731
01:06:57,826 --> 01:07:00,294
Hello?

732
01:07:58,553 --> 01:08:00,316
Taxi.

733
01:08:02,057 --> 01:08:03,149
Come here.

734
01:08:03,458 --> 01:08:05,756
- God, I'm so sorry.
- It's all right.

735
01:08:06,895 --> 01:08:09,056
This is great. Look, I got the money back.

736
01:08:09,130 --> 01:08:11,394
Isn't that great?
Now you can take me uptown.

737
01:08:11,466 --> 01:08:13,434
Great. I'll be right back.

738
01:08:13,902 --> 01:08:17,065
- See how you like it!
- No, don't!

739
01:08:19,441 --> 01:08:20,840
Oh, no!

740
01:08:24,212 --> 01:08:27,579
I don't believe it. Did you see that?

741
01:08:29,718 --> 01:08:31,618
Look at your arm. It's bleeding.

742
01:08:31,686 --> 01:08:33,017
Great.

743
01:08:33,121 --> 01:08:34,713
I feel terrible.

744
01:08:36,524 --> 01:08:39,618
Look, why don't you come with me?
I'll get you a bandage.

745
01:08:39,694 --> 01:08:43,061
- No, thank you. It's not that serious.
- No, I insist.

746
01:08:43,198 --> 01:08:44,256
No.

747
01:08:46,368 --> 01:08:48,029
- Do you have a telephone?
- Yeah.

748
01:08:51,940 --> 01:08:54,966
I'm sorry. I just...

749
01:08:56,211 --> 01:08:59,146
You wouldn't believe
what I've been through tonight.

750
01:08:59,214 --> 01:09:00,909
You wouldn't believe it.

751
01:09:02,117 --> 01:09:05,018
- I'm an ice-cream vendor. Mister Softee.
- What?

752
01:09:07,255 --> 01:09:09,883
You misunderstood.
I didn't ask what you did for a living.

753
01:09:09,958 --> 01:09:12,791
I said, "You wouldn't believe
what I've been through tonight."

754
01:09:12,861 --> 01:09:14,419
It's not boring.

755
01:09:15,897 --> 01:09:19,731
I have my own Mister Softee truck.
It's not boring.

756
01:09:21,469 --> 01:09:24,438
Also, you need a Class Four
New York State chauffeur's license.

757
01:09:24,506 --> 01:09:26,974
Guess who has one? Got it on my own.

758
01:09:27,042 --> 01:09:30,307
Manhattan, please. Could I have
the number of Peter Patzak?

759
01:09:30,612 --> 01:09:33,479
That's P-A-T-Z-A-K.

760
01:09:34,182 --> 01:09:35,945
- Need a pencil?
- No.

761
01:09:36,017 --> 01:09:37,951
On Mulberry Street.

762
01:09:40,922 --> 01:09:42,184
Thank you.

763
01:09:42,691 --> 01:09:46,127
5, 8, 1, 9...

764
01:09:47,028 --> 01:09:48,017
6...

765
01:09:49,397 --> 01:09:50,386
2.

766
01:10:00,208 --> 01:10:02,199
That was funny.

767
01:10:06,448 --> 01:10:11,010
Patzak, please. P-A-T-Z-A-K
on Mulberry Street in Manhattan.

768
01:10:11,319 --> 01:10:12,411
Thank you.

769
01:10:13,154 --> 01:10:15,452
- 5, 8, 6, 2...
- Don't.

770
01:10:15,523 --> 01:10:18,651
9, 3, 8, 0.

771
01:10:26,501 --> 01:10:28,526
Now I have forgotten the number.

772
01:10:30,372 --> 01:10:33,136
What is wrong with you? Are you all right?

773
01:10:35,744 --> 01:10:39,043
I have had a terrible, terrible night.
Do you understand?

774
01:10:39,114 --> 01:10:40,775
I'm just trying to entertain you.

775
01:10:40,849 --> 01:10:43,977
I don't want any entertainment!
And I'm sorry I did that.

776
01:10:45,887 --> 01:10:48,822
I'm under... Oh, God.

777
01:10:50,525 --> 01:10:53,517
I'm unable to get home tonight.
I can't get home.

778
01:10:54,095 --> 01:10:55,960
And I'm trying desperately...

779
01:10:56,998 --> 01:11:00,764
to find a place where I can stay tonight.
All I want to do sleep.

780
01:11:00,835 --> 01:11:03,668
I could stay in a place on Spring Street,
but I don't want to.

781
01:11:03,738 --> 01:11:05,000
- Why not?
- Why not what?

782
01:11:05,073 --> 01:11:07,098
Why aren't you there? Go.

783
01:11:07,175 --> 01:11:10,906
Because the bartender who lives there,
his girlfriend killed herself tonight.

784
01:11:10,979 --> 01:11:12,412
And I think it's because of me.

785
01:11:12,480 --> 01:11:15,381
- That's out, then.
- That's right, that's out.

786
01:11:15,450 --> 01:11:17,179
That is not a possibility.

787
01:11:18,253 --> 01:11:21,347
So if you just let me
make this phone call...

788
01:11:22,057 --> 01:11:24,617
you'd be doing me such a favor,
you really would.

789
01:11:24,692 --> 01:11:26,216
That can wait.

790
01:11:26,361 --> 01:11:30,320
I hurt your arm, and now
I want to dress your arm, please.

791
01:11:33,568 --> 01:11:34,830
All right.

792
01:11:36,571 --> 01:11:38,539
- How'd that get there?
- What?

793
01:11:40,642 --> 01:11:44,169
- I was dipping papier-mach earlier.
- What is this?

794
01:11:44,979 --> 01:11:48,210
"A man was torn limb from limb...

795
01:11:48,283 --> 01:11:50,751
"by an irate mob last night...

796
01:11:50,819 --> 01:11:53,549
"in the fashionable SoHo area
of Manhattan...

797
01:11:53,621 --> 01:11:57,557
"Police are having difficulty identifying
the man because no form of ID...

798
01:11:57,625 --> 01:11:59,456
"was found on his shredded clothing."

799
01:11:59,527 --> 01:12:00,551
Shredded?

800
01:12:00,628 --> 01:12:04,359
"His entire face was pummeled
completely beyond recognition..."

801
01:12:04,432 --> 01:12:07,424
Forget that.
I can't handle things like that right now.

802
01:12:07,502 --> 01:12:11,131
What does a guy have to do
to get his face pummeled?

803
01:12:11,206 --> 01:12:13,902
- Why does it hurt so much?
- Because it's infected.

804
01:12:13,975 --> 01:12:16,375
- Stop touching it!
- I want to get it off...

805
01:12:16,744 --> 01:12:18,336
- I know. I'll burn it off.
- No.

806
01:12:18,413 --> 01:12:21,473
I just need matches. I'll go ask a neighbor.

807
01:12:21,549 --> 01:12:23,983
- No, lady!
- My name is Gail!

808
01:12:30,558 --> 01:12:32,822
No matches. That's enough now.

809
01:12:32,894 --> 01:12:34,486
Where are you going?

810
01:12:35,463 --> 01:12:37,397
I'm going home. I'm walking home now.

811
01:12:37,465 --> 01:12:39,456
- How far is home?
- East 91st Street.

812
01:12:39,534 --> 01:12:41,627
East 91st? Are you kidding?

813
01:12:42,437 --> 01:12:44,166
Listen, I like you.

814
01:12:44,806 --> 01:12:47,274
Why don't I give you a ride
in my Mister Softee truck?

815
01:12:47,342 --> 01:12:48,934
How does that sound?

816
01:12:54,682 --> 01:12:57,173
- Where's the truck?
- Right around the corner.

817
01:13:07,695 --> 01:13:08,923
Come on.

818
01:13:13,601 --> 01:13:14,829
Come on.

819
01:13:16,871 --> 01:13:18,702
- What's the matter?
- Shut up.

820
01:13:20,208 --> 01:13:21,675
What's wrong?

821
01:13:22,310 --> 01:13:24,175
- You're dead, pal.
- I'm what?

822
01:13:25,446 --> 01:13:28,210
Gail, what are you doing? What's wrong?

823
01:13:30,351 --> 01:13:32,911
Gail, what is it?
Are you still giving me a lift home?

824
01:13:32,987 --> 01:13:35,353
Why are you looking at me like that for?

825
01:13:36,057 --> 01:13:39,652
That's him! Over there with the whistle.
That's him! Get him!

826
01:13:40,028 --> 01:13:41,393
Shit!

827
01:13:57,779 --> 01:13:59,974
Help! Call the police!

828
01:14:00,648 --> 01:14:03,208
I went to school with your son.

829
01:14:03,284 --> 01:14:08,017
Mom, it's me! I can't... God damn it!

830
01:14:28,343 --> 01:14:32,643
You're so stupid! Come on! Cut it out!

831
01:14:44,559 --> 01:14:46,117
I'll probably get blamed for that.

832
01:14:57,905 --> 01:15:01,306
What do you want from me?
What have I done?

833
01:15:02,010 --> 01:15:04,945
I'm just a word processor,
for Christ's sake!

834
01:15:17,458 --> 01:15:18,720
Excuse me.

835
01:15:20,862 --> 01:15:23,194
I wonder, would you...

836
01:15:23,264 --> 01:15:25,027
It's okay.

837
01:15:25,833 --> 01:15:28,597
Would you help me?
Would you please help me?

838
01:15:31,773 --> 01:15:33,502
What do you want me to do?

839
01:15:34,842 --> 01:15:38,141
Where do you live?
Can you take me home?

840
01:15:38,479 --> 01:15:42,677
There's certain things that I will not do.

841
01:15:43,885 --> 01:15:45,876
I'm telling you in advance.

842
01:15:53,594 --> 01:15:56,893
I really have to tell you something
before we start.

843
01:15:58,232 --> 01:16:01,395
I have never done this with a man before.

844
01:16:02,570 --> 01:16:04,504
I'm a little bit nervous.

845
01:16:09,844 --> 01:16:11,971
Listen, can I...

846
01:16:13,681 --> 01:16:15,444
Can I use your telephone?

847
01:16:15,917 --> 01:16:18,886
- Sure. It's...
- I see it. That's great.

848
01:16:21,622 --> 01:16:24,250
- <i>Operator.</i>
- Get me the police, please. Right away.

849
01:16:24,325 --> 01:16:25,952
<i>Just a minute.</i>

850
01:16:27,895 --> 01:16:31,353
- <i>12th Precinct, Fitzgerald.</i>
- Yes, Officer. Thank God.

851
01:16:33,067 --> 01:16:37,197
My name is Paul Hackett. I'm in SoHo.
I don't know the exact location.

852
01:16:37,939 --> 01:16:40,703
I'm being persecuted by a vigilante mob.

853
01:16:40,775 --> 01:16:42,606
I'm sure you're aware of their actions.

854
01:16:42,677 --> 01:16:47,512
Now, I have every reason in the world
to believe that my life is in serious danger.

855
01:16:48,750 --> 01:16:51,446
Evidently, there's a series of robberies...

856
01:16:51,519 --> 01:16:53,953
that are being conducted
in this neighborhood.

857
01:16:54,021 --> 01:16:55,579
<i>Just get some sleep, buddy.</i>

858
01:16:56,157 --> 01:16:57,920
Hello?

859
01:17:08,136 --> 01:17:09,899
I don't believe you.

860
01:17:19,514 --> 01:17:22,483
I'm sorry. I wonder...

861
01:17:23,418 --> 01:17:26,387
Could I just crash out
on your couch here for a couple hours?

862
01:17:26,454 --> 01:17:27,785
I am just beat.

863
01:17:28,189 --> 01:17:29,986
Why don't you just go home?

864
01:17:30,958 --> 01:17:33,756
I've been asking myself that one
all night long.

865
01:17:33,828 --> 01:17:36,695
So? What happened? Why can't you?

866
01:17:38,299 --> 01:17:39,596
All right.

867
01:17:40,735 --> 01:17:43,226
I met this girl tonight in a coffee shop.

868
01:17:43,304 --> 01:17:47,240
She gave me her phone number.
So when I got home, I gave her a call.

869
01:17:47,308 --> 01:17:51,745
She said to come over. In the cab,
all my money flew out the window.

870
01:17:52,280 --> 01:17:55,716
Then I got to know this girl,
and I didn't get along with her that well.

871
01:17:55,783 --> 01:17:57,375
It didn't really work out, so I left.

872
01:17:57,452 --> 01:18:01,149
I tried to take a subway tonight.
But the fare went up? Did you know that?

873
01:18:01,222 --> 01:18:02,519
- Yes.
- You knew that?

874
01:18:02,590 --> 01:18:04,581
I didn't know anything about that.

875
01:18:04,659 --> 01:18:07,787
I haven't enough money to get home
until I meet this bartender...

876
01:18:07,862 --> 01:18:11,821
a really nice guy who really wanted
to lend me the money...

877
01:18:13,167 --> 01:18:16,432
...they'd actually purchased
this piece of work here.

878
01:18:16,504 --> 01:18:18,665
I didn't know anything about that.

879
01:18:18,739 --> 01:18:21,799
She's pissed off at me,
and for this, I don't blame her at all...

880
01:18:21,876 --> 01:18:24,310
for the way I treated her friend.
It was inexcusable.

881
01:18:24,378 --> 01:18:27,814
So I march right in there to apologize,
but she'd already killed herself.

882
01:18:27,882 --> 01:18:29,281
I was too late.

883
01:18:29,350 --> 01:18:33,616
...he was about to give me the money,
when all of a sudden, his phone rang.

884
01:18:34,188 --> 01:18:36,053
His girlfriend killed herself tonight.

885
01:18:36,123 --> 01:18:39,490
Is that a coincidence?
No, because the same girl...

886
01:18:39,560 --> 01:18:41,790
who I came downtown to see
was dead, too.

887
01:18:41,863 --> 01:18:45,230
That's because they're the same person.
They're both dead.

888
01:18:45,299 --> 01:18:46,766
I couldn't believe that.

889
01:18:46,834 --> 01:18:50,133
He didn't know that I came down to,
you know, his girlfriend...

890
01:18:50,204 --> 01:18:54,197
because he would have taken my face
and he would have smashed it.

891
01:18:54,275 --> 01:18:58,507
Luckily, there was this girl, who saw
everything, who let me use her phone.

892
01:18:58,579 --> 01:19:01,548
Really nice about it, too.
Let me use the phone. That was it.

893
01:19:01,616 --> 01:19:04,210
Just use it. Pick it up and put it down.

894
01:19:04,285 --> 01:19:07,948
She's the one in the Mister Softee
ice-cream truck who's trying to kill me!

895
01:19:08,022 --> 01:19:11,685
They're all trying to kill me.
I just wanted to leave my apartment...

896
01:19:11,759 --> 01:19:15,627
maybe meet a nice girl.
And now I've got to die for it!

897
01:19:16,831 --> 01:19:20,597
That's the girl. That is Julie.
That's her. Look.

898
01:19:20,668 --> 01:19:23,535
Julie, it's me!

899
01:19:23,604 --> 01:19:25,799
What are you doing? Come here.

900
01:19:25,873 --> 01:19:29,639
Oh, God. That's the one. Unbelievable.

901
01:20:17,758 --> 01:20:19,555
What's the matter with you?

902
01:20:22,930 --> 01:20:26,991
- You've got to help me.
- Get a hold of yourself, okay?

903
01:20:27,068 --> 01:20:28,660
Can you get a glass of water?

904
01:20:28,736 --> 01:20:33,139
Tell them it's not my fault. I didn't do it.

905
01:20:33,207 --> 01:20:35,368
You've got to make things
clear to me, pal.

906
01:20:35,443 --> 01:20:38,901
I just got back from the morgue.
I'm not thinking too straight, either.

907
01:20:38,980 --> 01:20:41,676
There's an angry mob out there,
and they want to kill me...

908
01:20:41,749 --> 01:20:43,580
because they think
I'm robbing apartments.

909
01:20:43,651 --> 01:20:45,881
I had the keys to your apartment.
Did I rob you?

910
01:20:45,953 --> 01:20:50,185
I could have robbed your apartment.
I didn't because I'm not a thief.

911
01:20:50,324 --> 01:20:51,552
Right?

912
01:20:51,892 --> 01:20:53,484
I'm not a thief.

913
01:20:56,197 --> 01:20:58,722
- Stay here.
- Wait! Where are you going?

914
01:20:58,799 --> 01:21:00,232
To get your keys.

915
01:21:01,102 --> 01:21:04,833
Thank you. Go ahead. I'll be right here.

916
01:21:05,106 --> 01:21:07,006
- Just relax.
- I will.

917
01:21:12,647 --> 01:21:14,137
Thanks.

918
01:22:07,168 --> 01:22:08,465
He's in here!

919
01:22:40,901 --> 01:22:42,698
What can I do for you?

920
01:22:45,973 --> 01:22:48,567
- Why so empty?
- Invitation only.

921
01:22:53,314 --> 01:22:54,975
Then where is everybody?

922
01:22:55,449 --> 01:22:58,213
Beats me. Must have stayed home.

923
01:23:03,157 --> 01:23:04,488
Who's she?

924
01:23:06,460 --> 01:23:10,123
That's June. She's always here.
Usually nobody notices her.

925
01:23:13,300 --> 01:23:17,737
If you're interested, you better hurry.
I'm closing up in a few minutes.

926
01:24:25,172 --> 01:24:26,833
Excuse me, miss.

927
01:24:28,142 --> 01:24:31,771
I couldn't help noticing you,
and I wondered...

928
01:24:33,314 --> 01:24:34,611
would you...

929
01:24:35,416 --> 01:24:36,747
care to...

930
01:24:38,285 --> 01:24:41,152
join me for a drink?

931
01:24:43,991 --> 01:24:45,322
Just talking.

932
01:24:46,627 --> 01:24:48,458
I'm having a really...

933
01:24:50,064 --> 01:24:52,123
really bad night...

934
01:24:53,300 --> 01:24:56,064
and I can't seem to find anyone...

935
01:24:59,139 --> 01:25:02,836
who just will sit with me for just...

936
01:25:04,478 --> 01:25:08,539
Without yelling at me
or something, you know?

937
01:25:11,085 --> 01:25:13,883
I honestly wouldn't approach you
in this state...

938
01:25:15,556 --> 01:25:16,921
were I not so...

939
01:25:17,825 --> 01:25:19,190
unusually...

940
01:25:23,497 --> 01:25:24,862
intrigued.

941
01:25:31,538 --> 01:25:32,698
There.

942
01:25:39,113 --> 01:25:40,944
I bared my soul to you.

943
01:25:46,353 --> 01:25:47,786
May I?

944
01:26:29,063 --> 01:26:31,657
- Why are you doing this?
- What?

945
01:26:34,101 --> 01:26:38,265
You flirt with me.
You share your cigarette with me.

946
01:26:39,773 --> 01:26:41,297
You dance with me.

947
01:26:42,743 --> 01:26:44,438
You're nice to me.

948
01:26:44,945 --> 01:26:46,276
Open up!

949
01:26:46,347 --> 01:26:48,247
Why are you doing this?

950
01:26:54,021 --> 01:26:55,386
I want...

951
01:26:58,659 --> 01:26:59,717
to live.

952
01:26:59,793 --> 01:27:01,988
Sorry, folks. Closing up.

953
01:27:02,062 --> 01:27:05,088
I just want...

954
01:27:06,900 --> 01:27:08,492
to live.

955
01:27:10,404 --> 01:27:11,701
Live.

956
01:27:19,246 --> 01:27:21,476
Come downstairs with me, Paul.

957
01:28:18,005 --> 01:28:19,836
- They got in!
- What is it?

958
01:28:19,907 --> 01:28:24,037
I have to tell you, I'm in big trouble.
Those people up there want to kill me.

959
01:28:24,111 --> 01:28:26,875
- Is there another way out of here?
- No!

960
01:28:27,714 --> 01:28:30,182
- What is this?
- Don't go in there.

961
01:28:30,451 --> 01:28:33,318
- What's this?
- No, don't touch that!

962
01:28:33,620 --> 01:28:36,088
No, don't touch that vat!

963
01:28:40,127 --> 01:28:42,322
Oh, God.

964
01:28:46,633 --> 01:28:49,124
- Come with me, Paul.
- What?

965
01:28:49,203 --> 01:28:50,670
Come on.

966
01:28:50,737 --> 01:28:54,264
You're closed, and you want to go home.
It's only going to take a minute.

967
01:28:54,341 --> 01:28:58,368
- I'm telling you, no one's in here.
- You cannot reason with this man.

968
01:29:01,148 --> 01:29:04,549
Don't move.
I don't want to stick you with this stuff.

969
01:29:04,885 --> 01:29:07,285
I'm just gonna put this piece here.

970
01:29:07,354 --> 01:29:09,288
Hold up!

971
01:29:11,758 --> 01:29:13,885
You don't sense the pressure here?

972
01:29:15,896 --> 01:29:17,955
This is very good for the pores.

973
01:29:18,031 --> 01:29:20,363
- Come on, it's a total search!
- All right.

974
01:29:22,936 --> 01:29:24,597
- Good.
- No.

975
01:29:25,606 --> 01:29:27,403
Now pick this up.

976
01:29:28,976 --> 01:29:30,204
Where's this lead to?

977
01:29:35,249 --> 01:29:37,240
- A private apartment.
- Knock on the door.

978
01:29:37,317 --> 01:29:40,445
Wait. I'll knock.

979
01:29:42,890 --> 01:29:46,189
- June!
- Yeah, what is it?

980
01:29:46,260 --> 01:29:50,663
Some people want to look around
your place. Something about a robbery.

981
01:29:50,731 --> 01:29:52,858
I'm working! Can't you see I'm working?

982
01:29:52,933 --> 01:29:55,026
I know. I'm sorry.

983
01:29:56,003 --> 01:29:57,595
Excuse me.

984
01:29:58,705 --> 01:30:00,104
Have you seen this guy?

985
01:30:21,028 --> 01:30:22,825
Doesn't look so hard.

986
01:30:24,798 --> 01:30:27,892
- Is there another way out of here?
- No. That's it.

987
01:30:30,904 --> 01:30:34,237
All right, we're moving out! Come on.

988
01:30:35,042 --> 01:30:38,534
We're sorry we disturbed you, lady,
but we were sure that...

989
01:30:38,612 --> 01:30:42,412
Okay, let's boot it! Wasting time here.

990
01:30:48,455 --> 01:30:51,015
- It's okay. They're gone.
- Great.

991
01:30:53,126 --> 01:30:55,560
Okay, will you let me
out of this thing now?

992
01:30:55,629 --> 01:30:58,894
No. You're safe like this.
They could still come back.

993
01:30:58,966 --> 01:31:02,959
Look, lady, you've been great.
But can you let me out of here...

994
01:31:03,036 --> 01:31:06,870
Listen, I'm involved in this, too, now.
I got to keep working on you.

995
01:31:06,940 --> 01:31:08,874
They could still come back.

996
01:31:09,309 --> 01:31:13,473
Lady, let me out of this thing now!

997
01:31:13,547 --> 01:31:15,538
Do you hear me? Let me out...

998
01:31:20,988 --> 01:31:23,548
Okay, that's it.

999
01:31:23,857 --> 01:31:26,724
I just want to go upstairs
and check if they're still there.

1000
01:31:26,793 --> 01:31:28,385
Be right back.

1001
01:32:03,063 --> 01:32:06,430
Didn't I tell you, man? Check it out.

1002
01:32:07,100 --> 01:32:10,592
- Check it out.
- Man, this is junk.

1003
01:32:11,438 --> 01:32:14,737
What are you talking about?
This is antiques, man. This is old.

1004
01:32:14,808 --> 01:32:18,972
It's plastic. Let's call it a night.
We've got enough stuff already.

1005
01:32:21,948 --> 01:32:23,472
It's my sculpture!

1006
01:32:23,550 --> 01:32:25,814
- Be careful with it.
- All right.

1007
01:32:25,886 --> 01:32:27,979
Is it worth taking this thing?

1008
01:32:28,055 --> 01:32:30,649
Are you crazy, man? This is art.

1009
01:32:31,758 --> 01:32:33,589
Art sure is ugly, man.

1010
01:32:34,294 --> 01:32:38,492
Yeah, that's how much you know.
The uglier the art, the more it's worth.

1011
01:32:39,099 --> 01:32:42,159
- This must be worth a fortune.
- That's right.

1012
01:32:42,669 --> 01:32:45,035
- It's by that famous guy, Segal.
- Yeah?

1013
01:32:45,105 --> 01:32:48,233
You see him on the <i>Carson Show.</i>
Plays the banjo all the time.

1014
01:32:48,308 --> 01:32:49,798
I never watch <i>Carson.</i>

1015
01:32:51,078 --> 01:32:53,308
That's how much you know about art.

1016
01:32:54,414 --> 01:32:58,180
I don't know, man.
I'll take a stereo any day.

1017
01:32:58,719 --> 01:33:02,780
Yeah, what do you know, man?
A stereo's a stereo. Art is forever.

1018
01:36:55,388 --> 01:36:56,377
English
