1
00:02:09,087 --> 00:02:10,750
Nude women!

2
00:02:10,943 --> 00:02:12,376
Nude women!

3
00:02:12,479 --> 00:02:14,106
Clowns welcome!

4
00:02:14,207 --> 00:02:15,970
Clowns welcome!

5
00:02:16,063 --> 00:02:19,157
Nude women! Clowns welcome!

6
00:02:36,287 --> 00:02:39,552
- Hey! I got three more minutes.
- Come back tomorrow.

7
00:02:41,119 --> 00:02:44,520
- I said we're closed, Bozo.
- I wouldn't.

8
00:02:44,543 --> 00:02:47,011
And that's "Mr. Bozo," okay?

9
00:02:48,479 --> 00:02:51,937
Say, that's right. It ain't quite
closing time yet.

10
00:02:56,607 --> 00:02:58,438
Hugh...

11
00:02:58,527 --> 00:03:01,360
...let's not mess with me today, okay?

12
00:03:01,407 --> 00:03:03,341
I'm robbing the bank.

13
00:03:03,551 --> 00:03:05,746
What the hell kind of clown are you?

14
00:03:05,983 --> 00:03:10,386
- The crying-on-the-inside kind, I guess.
- Look, I'm just an old man.

15
00:03:10,463 --> 00:03:11,760
- Really?
- Yeah.

16
00:03:12,063 --> 00:03:13,496
Let's go.

17
00:03:21,727 --> 00:03:23,957
This is a robbery.

18
00:03:26,815 --> 00:03:28,009
Do you believe this?

19
00:03:28,127 --> 00:03:31,358
- This is a robbery.
- It is!

20
00:03:40,639 --> 00:03:42,004
Thank you.

21
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:46,073
All right, quiet, put your hands on top
of your head. Stand up.

22
00:03:49,759 --> 00:03:51,283
We're all gonna die.

23
00:03:51,839 --> 00:03:54,637
We're all gonna die.

24
00:03:55,231 --> 00:03:57,096
We're all gonna die!

25
00:04:04,094 --> 00:04:08,463
Button it up, pal.
Nobody likes a whiner.

26
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:11,771
Don't anybody move.

27
00:04:14,623 --> 00:04:18,150
What did I just say?

28
00:04:22,111 --> 00:04:25,274
All right. That's better.

29
00:04:29,023 --> 00:04:31,958
- Fill this up with regular, please.
- That's my money.

30
00:04:32,415 --> 00:04:35,714
- Don't worry. It's insured.
- She didn't give me no receipt yet.

31
00:04:35,743 --> 00:04:38,712
They can't insure it
if I don't got no receipt.

32
00:04:40,191 --> 00:04:42,716
Would you please give him a receipt.

33
00:04:42,783 --> 00:04:43,875
And you...

34
00:04:44,127 --> 00:04:46,891
...watch the double negatives, huh?
- Yes, sir.

35
00:04:47,167 --> 00:04:50,193
Okay, anybody else need a receipt?
Last chance.

36
00:04:50,239 --> 00:04:54,141
Okay, we're all going into the vault now.
Keep your hands on your heads.

37
00:04:54,143 --> 00:04:56,543
- Let's go.
- Do as he says, everyone.

38
00:04:56,607 --> 00:05:01,670
- This will all be over with presently.
- Don't dilly-dally. That's it.

39
00:05:13,311 --> 00:05:15,871
Hey! Move it! Move it!

40
00:05:23,359 --> 00:05:24,348
Move it back!

41
00:05:32,895 --> 00:05:35,796
- Do you have the key to this?
- You bet.

42
00:05:38,623 --> 00:05:41,922
I'll need another one of these
filled up from in there. Thanks.

43
00:05:41,951 --> 00:05:45,045
And I'm gonna need you
to make a phone call for me...

44
00:05:45,087 --> 00:05:46,645
...presently.

45
00:05:48,063 --> 00:05:51,260
Now, the police are gonna want me
to let some of you go...

46
00:05:51,295 --> 00:05:53,593
...as a sign of good faith.

47
00:05:54,431 --> 00:05:57,923
The best way to get out
is to stay calm.

48
00:05:57,951 --> 00:06:00,351
If they want proof that I'm serious...

49
00:06:00,414 --> 00:06:03,406
...I'll carve up the troublemakers first.

50
00:06:03,455 --> 00:06:05,685
Jesus, God!

51
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:08,922
- Shut up.
- Oh, Jesus! God!

52
00:06:08,958 --> 00:06:10,289
God!

53
00:06:12,063 --> 00:06:14,657
- May I use your phone?
- Yes.

54
00:06:19,102 --> 00:06:25,234
Give up now. That is the only door.
There is no other way out, my friend.

55
00:06:26,271 --> 00:06:30,139
Tell them anybody gets near this place,
I'm gonna blow it up.

56
00:06:30,143 --> 00:06:33,135
If I don't hear from the guy
in charge in 15 minutes...

57
00:06:33,183 --> 00:06:36,152
...I'll send your thumb out
through the night depository.

58
00:06:36,190 --> 00:06:38,181
And, thanks...

59
00:06:38,366 --> 00:06:40,095
...for calling me friend.

60
00:06:41,567 --> 00:06:45,367
This is Princeton. You have
less than 15 minutes to call in.

61
00:06:45,374 --> 00:06:49,401
Do not come near the bank.
He is covered in dynamite.

62
00:07:05,279 --> 00:07:07,076
Hot dogs! Hot dogs!

63
00:07:13,374 --> 00:07:15,205
Give me sound down.

64
00:07:16,446 --> 00:07:20,542
Chief, apparently we've got 12 people
in there. One guy, heavily armed.

65
00:07:20,577 --> 00:07:25,206
Bank security got this picture.
This is our perpetrator.

66
00:07:30,206 --> 00:07:34,108
- The hostage negotiator's on his way, sir.
- Tell him he won't be needed.

67
00:07:34,111 --> 00:07:37,444
- Till when, sir?
- Till I'm no longer chief.

68
00:07:44,094 --> 00:07:47,393
To my beloved wife Carol,
I leave the house in Westchester...

69
00:07:47,422 --> 00:07:49,447
...and the apartment on 78th Street.

70
00:07:49,535 --> 00:07:53,631
The stock portfolio will be divided equally
among our children.

71
00:07:53,666 --> 00:07:56,293
David, you can have the Giants tickets.

72
00:08:00,510 --> 00:08:02,410
Don't do this.

73
00:08:02,494 --> 00:08:03,825
It'll be okay.

74
00:08:03,935 --> 00:08:05,596
He said...

75
00:08:05,695 --> 00:08:10,530
...he'd carve up the troublemakers first.

76
00:08:11,807 --> 00:08:15,299
Why don't you shut the hell up!
Crybaby.

77
00:08:22,207 --> 00:08:23,231
Damn!

78
00:08:23,999 --> 00:08:25,466
Give me a break.

79
00:08:29,310 --> 00:08:31,039
Coming.

80
00:08:41,694 --> 00:08:44,094
- Mom?
- This is Rotzinger.

81
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:46,127
Who are you? Where's Mom?

82
00:08:46,558 --> 00:08:50,187
Chief of police.
Get your butt out of there now.

83
00:08:50,526 --> 00:08:53,188
You know, I was in 'Nam
with a jerk like you.

84
00:08:53,247 --> 00:08:54,271
Oh, boy.

85
00:08:54,751 --> 00:08:57,276
What's your name, son?
What shall I call you?

86
00:08:57,791 --> 00:08:59,156
<i>Well...</i>

87
00:09:00,350 --> 00:09:03,251
...I always liked the name Chip.

88
00:09:03,295 --> 00:09:05,229
Would you call me Chip?

89
00:09:05,311 --> 00:09:06,903
<i>Okay.</i>

90
00:09:07,006 --> 00:09:09,133
<i>What was that shooting just now, Chip?</i>

91
00:09:09,215 --> 00:09:12,275
Oh, wait! Call me Skip.

92
00:09:12,606 --> 00:09:16,167
Okay, Skip. What was that shooting?

93
00:09:16,575 --> 00:09:18,873
Well, the cameras.

94
00:09:18,942 --> 00:09:22,105
I shot the cameras.
They were looking at me.

95
00:09:22,526 --> 00:09:24,289
Quit looking at me!

96
00:09:26,847 --> 00:09:28,212
My God. He's barking.

97
00:09:28,319 --> 00:09:31,720
Skip, we can be inside, on top of you,
in a heartbeat.

98
00:09:31,806 --> 00:09:33,967
<i>Try to run, you won't get 5 feet.</i>

99
00:09:34,046 --> 00:09:37,846
Yeah. Well, you tell your men
just one bullet could hit some dynamite...

100
00:09:37,855 --> 00:09:41,518
...and blow up the whole street.
I've planted it everywhere, you know.

101
00:09:41,534 --> 00:09:44,059
Don't you think I know
how you plan to get out?

102
00:09:44,127 --> 00:09:46,652
Switch on a recorder,
I'm talking to a machine...

103
00:09:46,718 --> 00:09:49,414
...while you crawl out
through the third-floor vent.

104
00:09:49,471 --> 00:09:52,497
Not a bad plan, except I couldn't fit
with all this money.

105
00:09:52,542 --> 00:09:56,137
Besides, I've booby-trapped the vents
with heavy explosives.

106
00:09:58,302 --> 00:10:00,031
Come on down! Get out of there!

107
00:10:07,615 --> 00:10:09,947
God, I hate this town.

108
00:10:11,551 --> 00:10:15,351
Let's see if we can make
a deal here, Chip. Skip.

109
00:10:15,359 --> 00:10:18,351
<i>- I'd like to get those people out of there.
- Fine.</i>

110
00:10:18,398 --> 00:10:23,700
I want a city bus with a full tank of gas.

111
00:10:23,735 --> 00:10:28,106
I want a Harley-Davidson XL 1 ooo.

112
00:10:28,414 --> 00:10:31,315
I want a monster truck.

113
00:10:31,359 --> 00:10:34,760
- A what?
- And I want two Jet Ranger helicopters...

114
00:10:34,782 --> 00:10:36,409
...here on the street.

115
00:10:38,206 --> 00:10:42,074
I'll get you the choppers,
I'll get you the bus, the Harley...

116
00:10:42,079 --> 00:10:46,982
...and the monster truck just as soon
as you give me the damn hostages.

117
00:10:47,006 --> 00:10:49,440
Oh, yeah. I'm sure
no harm will come to me...

118
00:10:49,503 --> 00:10:51,994
...once I'm inside the bank
all by myself.

119
00:10:52,958 --> 00:10:56,325
- At least give me the women.
- Get your own women.

120
00:10:56,350 --> 00:10:58,375
<i>One hostage per demand.</i>

121
00:10:58,462 --> 00:11:02,762
One?! Listen, I've had just about enough
of your comedy, clown.

122
00:11:02,797 --> 00:11:05,515
<i>- We're coming in through the plate glass.
- All right.</i>

123
00:11:05,694 --> 00:11:09,255
I gotta hang up now because I gotta go
kill everybody, okay?

124
00:11:09,278 --> 00:11:11,974
Don't bust my chops, wise guy.
It's not that easy.

125
00:11:12,030 --> 00:11:16,899
It takes time to find two pilots who
are willing to fly out an armed felon.

126
00:11:16,934 --> 00:11:18,090
I don't need a pilot.

127
00:11:18,207 --> 00:11:22,912
Now, you got 3o minutes to meet my first
demand. What's your number out there?

128
00:11:22,947 --> 00:11:27,618
259-o66o. Don't try anything rash,
or you're dead along with everyone else.

129
00:11:27,653 --> 00:11:30,847
6o? And that's here in area code 212?

130
00:11:33,311 --> 00:11:36,872
All right. Do what he says:
The chopper, the bus, everything.

131
00:11:36,895 --> 00:11:39,955
Set them up out here
as soon as they arrive.

132
00:11:40,670 --> 00:11:44,572
- Is it a diversion, chief, or is he crazy?
- He's not crazy.

133
00:11:44,575 --> 00:11:48,409
He'll come out of that bank with
a few hostages also dressed as clowns.

134
00:11:48,415 --> 00:11:52,511
He'll make a run for a chopper
assuming we're afraid to shoot a hostage.

135
00:11:52,546 --> 00:11:54,308
Are we?

136
00:11:54,687 --> 00:11:59,181
He said no pilots. That means he's flying it.
Probably learned how in 'Nam.

137
00:11:59,216 --> 00:12:02,727
Now, they'll get a bead on whichever clown
takes the controls...

138
00:12:02,750 --> 00:12:05,412
...and take him out
before he leaves the ground.

139
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:07,886
Here he comes.

140
00:12:08,542 --> 00:12:10,976
- He's gonna let one of us go.
- Oldest first.

141
00:12:11,038 --> 00:12:14,633
That makes sense: Save the one
who will die first of natural causes.

142
00:12:14,654 --> 00:12:15,712
You prick.

143
00:12:16,702 --> 00:12:20,194
- I'm gonna vomit.
- We better get him out of here first.

144
00:12:20,222 --> 00:12:22,156
- No way!
- The hell with him.

145
00:12:26,142 --> 00:12:29,441
- It's been decided. I'm the first to go.
- What?!

146
00:12:29,470 --> 00:12:32,166
- Who decided it?
- I did.

147
00:12:32,223 --> 00:12:35,624
It really isn't your decision,
Mr. Adolf Hitler.

148
00:12:36,319 --> 00:12:40,085
- Have you got my money ready back there?
- It's here.

149
00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:52,952
You're the kind of person that gets
innocent bystanders killed.

150
00:12:57,918 --> 00:13:00,512
They're meeting my first demand.

151
00:13:00,575 --> 00:13:05,512
All right, to show this fascist dictator here
how our system works...

152
00:13:05,534 --> 00:13:08,526
...I'll let you folks decide
who will be the first to go.

153
00:13:08,574 --> 00:13:10,542
- Him!
- Him!

154
00:13:12,351 --> 00:13:14,216
- Him?
- Yes!

155
00:13:15,518 --> 00:13:18,783
Let's... Come on. Come on. Let's go.

156
00:13:18,815 --> 00:13:21,215
Get downwind of me.

157
00:14:00,703 --> 00:14:03,695
<i>Sir, is human life at stake?</i>

158
00:14:03,742 --> 00:14:06,370
<i>The stink of death was in the air.</i>

159
00:14:06,430 --> 00:14:11,094
<i>He said he knew how to make men
sit up and bark.</i>

160
00:14:11,134 --> 00:14:12,931
Oh, don't exaggerate or anything.

161
00:14:13,022 --> 00:14:15,855
<i>And so we have our first report
from inside the bank.</i>

162
00:14:15,902 --> 00:14:21,067
<i>Our first description of this clown
at whom no one is laughing.</i>

163
00:14:21,854 --> 00:14:23,253
Now, that's original.

164
00:14:23,358 --> 00:14:28,261
<i>Steve, Jody, I'll be here
until the last hostage is released.</i>

165
00:14:31,582 --> 00:14:34,517
Can it. Here comes Clarabell.

166
00:14:34,942 --> 00:14:37,570
- Hi.
- Hi.

167
00:14:43,678 --> 00:14:47,205
- What's this?
- It's just a gift.

168
00:14:47,262 --> 00:14:52,097
Okay, it's an Audemars Piguet.
Moon phase, 18-karat gold, alligator band.

169
00:14:52,132 --> 00:14:54,860
Thing cost me 12,ooo,
but it's appreciating every day.

170
00:14:54,910 --> 00:14:57,071
As I say, it's my gift to you.

171
00:14:57,150 --> 00:15:00,916
- Boy, it is nice.
- Isn't it?

172
00:15:01,502 --> 00:15:04,266
- I can't keep this.
- Don't be silly.

173
00:15:05,214 --> 00:15:07,114
No, I would be beholden.

174
00:15:10,974 --> 00:15:12,168
May I buy it?

175
00:15:12,638 --> 00:15:16,267
- I mean, would you take three bills for it?
- Three hundred dollars?

176
00:15:16,574 --> 00:15:21,034
Unless someone makes a higher offer.
Anyone want to go higher than 3oo on this?

177
00:15:21,069 --> 00:15:23,388
It's got a moon on it.

178
00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:26,317
Great. And here's my watch.
It's a Timex...

179
00:15:26,430 --> 00:15:29,365
...and the band is the Twist-o-Flex
by Speidel.

180
00:15:29,406 --> 00:15:33,342
I appreciate this damn thing
more and more every day.

181
00:15:39,646 --> 00:15:41,978
You pig.

182
00:15:42,206 --> 00:15:44,504
Excuse me? Pig?

183
00:15:44,574 --> 00:15:48,442
I doubt it. Think the lady
protests too much, or what?

184
00:15:48,446 --> 00:15:52,542
I think you're just afraid to party
with a real man.

185
00:15:53,150 --> 00:15:55,812
A real man, who has to use a gun...

186
00:15:56,318 --> 00:15:59,981
...who has to dress up like that
and keep people prisoner?

187
00:15:59,999 --> 00:16:01,830
You're not a man.

188
00:16:01,919 --> 00:16:03,887
You're a coward.

189
00:16:04,510 --> 00:16:06,842
Oh, no. No!

190
00:16:07,550 --> 00:16:10,576
She... She does not speak
for the rest of us, Mr. Clown.

191
00:16:10,622 --> 00:16:14,422
We think you're quite brave.
And manly.

192
00:16:14,430 --> 00:16:17,092
You big pussy!
I don't believe you.

193
00:16:17,150 --> 00:16:20,347
- You're a bunch of pussies.
- Why don't you take her out next.

194
00:16:20,382 --> 00:16:23,351
You don't need this kind of aggravation.

195
00:16:34,462 --> 00:16:38,558
Hey, chief. On the bus, we've got an
ex-Green Beret under the back seat.

196
00:16:38,593 --> 00:16:41,755
In the motorcycle, we got enough gas
to carry it half a mile.

197
00:16:41,790 --> 00:16:44,554
We stationed shooters
a half-mile in every direction.

198
00:16:44,606 --> 00:16:47,302
- Any word on the monster truck?
- About half an hour.

199
00:16:47,358 --> 00:16:49,918
Did you get any description
of the perpetrator?

200
00:16:49,982 --> 00:16:54,078
Average height, average build,
red nose and blue hair.

201
00:16:55,294 --> 00:16:56,488
Thanks.

202
00:17:02,302 --> 00:17:06,329
<i>- Thank you for using A T& T.
- Your bike's out here. So's your bus.</i>

203
00:17:06,334 --> 00:17:09,201
<i>- You owe me two more hostages.
- They're coming.</i>

204
00:17:09,246 --> 00:17:11,612
<i>Tell me when my monster truck gets here.</i>

205
00:17:15,102 --> 00:17:17,570
- You ready, doll?
- All set.

206
00:17:17,630 --> 00:17:19,791
Relax. I'm right behind you.

207
00:17:30,238 --> 00:17:32,229
Come on, already.

208
00:17:37,342 --> 00:17:40,573
<i>Son of a bitch! Bastard!</i>

209
00:17:49,886 --> 00:17:52,286
- Are you people all right?
- Let's keep moving.

210
00:17:52,350 --> 00:17:55,376
He's peeking at us through the curtains.

211
00:17:59,166 --> 00:18:00,724
The man is an animal.

212
00:18:00,830 --> 00:18:04,266
Ripping out phones, urinating on desks.

213
00:18:04,286 --> 00:18:06,584
You see what he did
to Miss Cochran's shirt?

214
00:18:06,654 --> 00:18:10,112
There's a scratch here.
It's not deep, but it's there.

215
00:18:10,142 --> 00:18:11,666
It's okay.

216
00:18:11,774 --> 00:18:15,175
Did he hurt anybody else?
Is the strain beginning to show on him?

217
00:18:15,198 --> 00:18:20,261
"If I could sleep 1 o days in a rice paddy,
I could certainly last in this lousy bank."

218
00:18:20,413 --> 00:18:24,008
This is what the animal said to us.
He says to Miss Cochran here:

219
00:18:24,030 --> 00:18:27,227
"Baby, up your butt with a coconut."

220
00:18:27,550 --> 00:18:31,987
I think he was prepared to do it,
except I saw no coconut.

221
00:18:32,022 --> 00:18:33,763
He had no coconut to my knowledge.

222
00:18:33,853 --> 00:18:35,650
No coconut, huh?

223
00:18:35,742 --> 00:18:37,801
What about dynamite?
Did you see any?

224
00:18:37,886 --> 00:18:39,877
Any? It's everywhere.

225
00:18:39,965 --> 00:18:42,456
It's on him. It's on us.

226
00:18:42,526 --> 00:18:46,155
Hostages strapped to tables as shields.

227
00:18:46,174 --> 00:18:48,142
The man is an animal.

228
00:18:48,222 --> 00:18:49,985
He's sick.

229
00:18:53,661 --> 00:18:55,128
You okay, mister?

230
00:18:55,646 --> 00:18:59,412
Officer Martin, take these two
to the doctor, just as a precaution.

231
00:18:59,421 --> 00:19:01,218
Yes, sir.

232
00:19:03,294 --> 00:19:06,730
- The key is, he's an animal.
- That much is clear, sir.

233
00:19:06,750 --> 00:19:11,414
Oh, so I'm repeating myself. I suppose you
want to throw me back in there with him.

234
00:20:07,550 --> 00:20:09,245
It's 4:48.

235
00:20:09,342 --> 00:20:12,641
If he hasn't called back by 5,
we storm the bank.

236
00:20:26,878 --> 00:20:28,505
Damn.

237
00:20:59,998 --> 00:21:01,260
This is Rotzinger.

238
00:21:01,374 --> 00:21:03,342
<i>Can you give me a little more time?</i>

239
00:21:03,422 --> 00:21:05,754
<i>I promise I won't hurt anybody.</i>

240
00:21:05,822 --> 00:21:08,655
<i>I'll call you right back. I promise.</i>

241
00:21:12,734 --> 00:21:14,964
Now, where were we?

242
00:21:17,342 --> 00:21:21,369
Oh, Phyllis! Oh, Phyllis!

243
00:21:22,526 --> 00:21:24,221
Grimm.

244
00:21:27,358 --> 00:21:28,552
Guys.

245
00:21:28,670 --> 00:21:33,403
Phyllis, you were so great back there.
I felt like you were protecting me for real.

246
00:21:33,438 --> 00:21:36,171
I couldn't tell if you were pretending.
You were good.

247
00:21:36,222 --> 00:21:39,714
This is true. Let's see Miss Meryl Streep
try to vomit on cue, huh?

248
00:21:39,806 --> 00:21:40,966
Fantastic.

249
00:21:41,086 --> 00:21:45,352
Loomis, could we have
two seconds alone?

250
00:21:46,174 --> 00:21:48,734
- Sure, Grimm.
- Thanks.

251
00:22:00,222 --> 00:22:02,087
I can't believe we did it.

252
00:22:02,173 --> 00:22:04,437
Do you remember the night
you proposed?

253
00:22:04,830 --> 00:22:06,923
- Proposed?
- Yeah.

254
00:22:07,006 --> 00:22:10,203
Oh, you mean the night the pipes froze
and the heat went out?

255
00:22:10,238 --> 00:22:12,365
And as we lay there freezing...

256
00:22:12,446 --> 00:22:16,212
...waiting to be discovered dead,
you gave me that look.

257
00:22:16,221 --> 00:22:19,054
That look a woman
gives her man that says:

258
00:22:19,101 --> 00:22:22,127
"I blame you for everything."

259
00:22:22,174 --> 00:22:23,732
Yeah, that look.

260
00:22:24,382 --> 00:22:28,318
I said, "Phyllis, before we lose our
self-respect, let's make a commitment.

261
00:22:28,353 --> 00:22:31,685
Let's not be the Bickersons,
like every other couple on the IRT.

262
00:22:31,966 --> 00:22:33,763
I know a way.

263
00:22:33,853 --> 00:22:37,084
Phyllis, will you rob a bank with me?"

264
00:22:37,693 --> 00:22:40,526
I will, Grimm. I will.

265
00:22:46,814 --> 00:22:48,509
Grimm...

266
00:22:49,246 --> 00:22:51,214
...I have to tell you something.

267
00:22:51,293 --> 00:22:53,761
I found something out yesterday.

268
00:22:55,166 --> 00:22:57,191
What? What is it?

269
00:22:57,278 --> 00:22:58,643
I just feel funny.

270
00:22:59,198 --> 00:23:02,395
I feel... You know, I feel complete.

271
00:23:02,782 --> 00:23:04,682
Grimm, you already were complete.

272
00:23:04,766 --> 00:23:08,258
If you were any more complete,
it would be a little scary.

273
00:23:16,126 --> 00:23:18,788
Bad neighborhood to get
in touch with our feelings.

274
00:23:18,846 --> 00:23:20,973
Especially with a fortune
in our falsies.

275
00:23:21,053 --> 00:23:23,886
All right, I gotta make a quick call
to the chief.

276
00:23:27,102 --> 00:23:30,868
<i>- This is Rotzinger.
- Yes. Have you got Prince Albert in a can?</i>

277
00:23:30,878 --> 00:23:33,039
Feeling better, I see.

278
00:23:33,118 --> 00:23:35,313
Your Macho Maniac is here.

279
00:23:35,390 --> 00:23:36,857
<i>You owe me another hostage.</i>

280
00:23:36,958 --> 00:23:40,655
<i>I'll check it out. I'm going to
the window. Tell your men to get back.</i>

281
00:23:44,158 --> 00:23:46,149
Did you have something to tell me?

282
00:23:46,238 --> 00:23:48,035
I want to wait.

283
00:23:50,301 --> 00:23:53,862
I can see it doesn't have
a hydraulic tilt body. It's unacceptable.

284
00:23:53,885 --> 00:23:55,352
<i>What?! You son of a bitch.</i>

285
00:23:55,453 --> 00:23:59,287
You never said a goddamn word
about a "tilting hydraulic body."

286
00:23:59,293 --> 00:24:02,228
We had to send all the way to Jersey
for this thing.

287
00:24:02,270 --> 00:24:04,033
<i>Don't insult me.</i>

288
00:24:04,126 --> 00:24:06,560
Now, you get me
a respectable monster truck...

289
00:24:06,621 --> 00:24:09,988
...and don't get back to me
until you do, okay?

290
00:24:12,445 --> 00:24:14,413
- What was that?
- What was what?

291
00:24:14,494 --> 00:24:16,223
Don't try to change the subject.

292
00:24:16,318 --> 00:24:20,794
- No tilt body, no hostages.
- I want hostages.

293
00:24:20,829 --> 00:24:24,287
It's gonna take time
to find a tilting hydraulic body.

294
00:24:24,317 --> 00:24:26,649
<i>Well, that's not my problem.</i>

295
00:24:42,493 --> 00:24:44,859
It was an accident.

296
00:24:45,693 --> 00:24:49,390
They would have waited forever
to go into that bank.

297
00:24:49,789 --> 00:24:53,156
Just throw me out of the car
and run me over.

298
00:24:53,182 --> 00:24:55,776
I could have called them
from anywhere tonight...

299
00:24:55,837 --> 00:24:58,237
...just to tell them I was still in the bank.

300
00:25:05,885 --> 00:25:09,218
Let's get to the airport.
We'll pretend this didn't happen.

301
00:25:10,301 --> 00:25:13,099
<i>Now, you get me
a respectable monster truck...</i>

302
00:25:13,150 --> 00:25:16,210
<i>... and don't get back to me
until you do, okay?</i>

303
00:25:16,638 --> 00:25:17,900
There it is, a beep.

304
00:25:18,013 --> 00:25:20,743
- Can you isolate that beep?
- I can try.

305
00:25:20,797 --> 00:25:24,233
It could be a horn. Clowns carry horns,
little rubber ones.

306
00:25:24,254 --> 00:25:27,781
- Sometimes their noses are horns.
- I wanna know what beeped, fast.

307
00:25:27,806 --> 00:25:29,671
I'll tell you what I think it was.

308
00:25:29,757 --> 00:25:33,215
And it wasn't his fucking nose.
It was a car horn.

309
00:25:39,101 --> 00:25:41,763
How much time did we lose, exactly?

310
00:25:41,821 --> 00:25:44,585
They won't storm in
until they're sure I'm not there.

311
00:25:44,638 --> 00:25:49,166
Then there's chaos while they round up
hostages and take statements and names.

312
00:25:49,201 --> 00:25:51,549
Finally, they'll realize some are missing.

313
00:25:51,613 --> 00:25:54,241
<i>- By then...
- our plane is taking off?</i>

314
00:25:54,301 --> 00:25:56,428
And they still won't know who we are.

315
00:25:56,510 --> 00:25:59,411
For God's sake, shut that up!

316
00:25:59,453 --> 00:26:02,047
Turn that trash off!

317
00:26:02,718 --> 00:26:04,982
God, I hate this town.

318
00:26:09,757 --> 00:26:11,884
Grimm, guess what.

319
00:26:11,966 --> 00:26:14,560
Wait a second.
I never scouted this neighborhood.

320
00:26:14,621 --> 00:26:16,486
Did we miss the Expressway?

321
00:26:16,573 --> 00:26:18,473
I didn't see it.

322
00:26:19,582 --> 00:26:22,745
They were working on the signs back there.

323
00:26:31,358 --> 00:26:33,019
Go! Go! Go!

324
00:26:54,525 --> 00:26:57,085
We wanna get on
the Brooklyn Queens Expressway.

325
00:26:57,149 --> 00:26:59,310
- What?
- The BQE.

326
00:27:00,510 --> 00:27:03,502
Wow, you know,
jeez, we don't know where that is.

327
00:27:04,189 --> 00:27:07,488
- Shut up!
- Hey, you shut up!

328
00:27:07,517 --> 00:27:09,644
- Shut up!
- Shut up! Shut up!

329
00:27:09,725 --> 00:27:13,217
Let's just walk through this, okay?
Does that sign say BQE?

330
00:27:13,758 --> 00:27:15,589
Yeah.

331
00:27:15,805 --> 00:27:19,297
Okay, so which way was the arrow pointing?

332
00:27:19,325 --> 00:27:23,091
That was an hour ago. That witch
ain't stopped screaming the whole time.

333
00:27:23,102 --> 00:27:26,265
She even had her baby screaming at us.

334
00:27:26,301 --> 00:27:29,134
Let me try this:
Will you be putting up a new sign?

335
00:27:29,437 --> 00:27:32,133
- Not today.
- Today's just taking shit down.

336
00:27:33,085 --> 00:27:34,848
Can you tell us anything?

337
00:27:34,941 --> 00:27:37,739
The names of a street, any street?

338
00:27:37,789 --> 00:27:40,815
- The directions: North, south?
- It's not our neighborhood.

339
00:27:40,861 --> 00:27:42,522
Honey, babe.

340
00:27:43,101 --> 00:27:46,593
- You've got a gun. Shoot them.
- I want to, but they're fur-bearing.

341
00:27:46,621 --> 00:27:48,782
I'd need some kind of permit, wouldn't I?

342
00:27:49,085 --> 00:27:53,021
Thanks, guys. You could've given us help,
but you've given us so much more.

343
00:27:53,022 --> 00:27:55,354
Hey, that's what we're here for, right?

344
00:27:59,134 --> 00:28:00,431
I'm glad this happened.

345
00:28:00,542 --> 00:28:03,568
It's another little reminder
of why we pulled this thing.

346
00:28:03,613 --> 00:28:07,982
You know what their problem is?
They live here, that's all.

347
00:28:08,017 --> 00:28:10,366
But we don't. Not anymore.

348
00:28:10,877 --> 00:28:14,142
How hot does this baby burn?

349
00:28:15,485 --> 00:28:18,454
Anybody find a watch out there?

350
00:28:18,909 --> 00:28:22,140
- Did you send men into the sewer?
- Are you grasping at straws?

351
00:28:22,174 --> 00:28:27,009
- How much time was wasted in the sewer?
- Where do you guys get this stuff?

352
00:28:39,773 --> 00:28:44,676
Take the hostages' statements in the bus.
He's getting farther away every second.

353
00:28:48,157 --> 00:28:50,785
Oh, we're really making progress now.

354
00:28:51,037 --> 00:28:54,268
I saw a sign, Phyllis.

355
00:29:09,566 --> 00:29:11,830
If we could just find a landmark.

356
00:29:21,086 --> 00:29:23,020
Ask this guy.

357
00:29:28,253 --> 00:29:30,585
Excuse me. Sir?

358
00:29:32,637 --> 00:29:35,265
Sir? Excuse me.

359
00:30:19,133 --> 00:30:21,727
It's bad luck just seeing
a thing like that.

360
00:30:30,462 --> 00:30:32,896
Things are going to hell, aren't they?

361
00:30:32,957 --> 00:30:35,721
It's just a couple guys
sorting out some things.

362
00:30:35,773 --> 00:30:40,506
- We're gonna find a familiar street soon.
- I'd settle for a familiar borough.

363
00:30:40,541 --> 00:30:43,844
I think we're near John Philip Sousa.

364
00:30:43,869 --> 00:30:46,804
That was our junior high school.
Aren't we, Grimm?

365
00:30:46,845 --> 00:30:50,246
Not unless there's been an H-bomb mishap
since prom.

366
00:30:57,725 --> 00:30:59,920
Can you help us find the BQE?

367
00:31:00,574 --> 00:31:03,372
Glad to. Got a map right here
in the glove.

368
00:31:13,341 --> 00:31:16,003
Wait a minute.
This guy's too wonderful.

369
00:31:16,061 --> 00:31:19,792
- So?
- So definitely a felon. Dangerous.

370
00:31:19,805 --> 00:31:21,898
Probably a serial killer.

371
00:31:21,981 --> 00:31:24,211
Maybe he's just from out of town.

372
00:31:25,949 --> 00:31:29,316
- He is. He's got Iowa plates.
- There you go.

373
00:31:35,581 --> 00:31:38,516
- Where was the Clutter family from?
- Kansas.

374
00:31:38,557 --> 00:31:39,785
Just checking.

375
00:31:39,901 --> 00:31:42,734
Say, the bank was really beautiful,
wasn't it?

376
00:31:46,237 --> 00:31:48,569
It sure was, Grimm.

377
00:31:55,453 --> 00:31:56,886
Hey, Phyllis.

378
00:31:56,989 --> 00:31:59,514
Grimm needs a little reassuring.

379
00:31:59,581 --> 00:32:01,742
No, he doesn't.

380
00:32:02,173 --> 00:32:04,141
He's complete now.

381
00:32:04,765 --> 00:32:09,566
- There you are.
- Great. Great. Thank you.

382
00:32:09,601 --> 00:32:11,694
Hey, is everybody this nice in Iowa?

383
00:32:11,773 --> 00:32:13,536
- Iowa?
- Yeah.

384
00:32:14,621 --> 00:32:15,747
That's a stolen car.

385
00:32:17,949 --> 00:32:20,281
Grimm doesn't seem any different,
does he?

386
00:32:20,349 --> 00:32:25,616
Well, yesterday, he was just a guy working
in the Department of City Planning.

387
00:32:25,981 --> 00:32:29,801
And today,
he's a world-class bank robber.

388
00:32:29,836 --> 00:32:33,622
Thank you, Loomis.
You're very comforting.

389
00:32:34,558 --> 00:32:38,153
- This is a fucking nightmare.
- Doesn't even know the capital of Iowa.

390
00:32:38,173 --> 00:32:39,731
Shut up.

391
00:32:41,469 --> 00:32:43,960
This must be my lucky day.

392
00:32:44,029 --> 00:32:46,589
You got some real money here.

393
00:32:50,781 --> 00:32:53,409
Four dollars.

394
00:32:53,981 --> 00:32:56,279
Well, I couldn't get to the bank today.

395
00:32:56,349 --> 00:32:57,976
Let me give you this watch.

396
00:32:58,077 --> 00:33:00,238
It's worth $ 12,ooo.
I talked the guy down.

397
00:33:00,317 --> 00:33:02,877
He ended up giving it to me for 3oo.
Nice, huh?

398
00:33:02,941 --> 00:33:06,877
God, are you a sucker.
Let's see what's in the trunk.

399
00:33:17,917 --> 00:33:21,318
Thanks. Bye-bye.

400
00:33:26,109 --> 00:33:28,509
Oh, sir, you forgot your map.

401
00:33:28,573 --> 00:33:30,768
And our million dollars.

402
00:33:33,213 --> 00:33:36,410
- Was it Dubuque?
- Des Moines.

403
00:33:36,861 --> 00:33:40,820
- Now can we go to the airport?
- In the clothes we wore out of the bank?

404
00:33:41,821 --> 00:33:43,812
Flatbush is 15 minutes from here.

405
00:33:43,901 --> 00:33:46,335
We'll stop at Woolworth's.
The sky's the limit.

406
00:33:46,397 --> 00:33:48,558
If Einstein here hadn't honked
the horn...

407
00:33:48,637 --> 00:33:51,504
...we could've changed clothes
before they were stolen.

408
00:33:51,549 --> 00:33:54,916
- It was an accident, Phyllis.
- Oh, you know, so was Chernobyl.

409
00:33:54,941 --> 00:33:56,875
But Loomis didn't irradiate anybody.

410
00:34:02,173 --> 00:34:04,573
- Grimm, make her stop.
- Don't worry about it.

411
00:34:04,637 --> 00:34:06,798
When I hit you, start worrying.
And you.

412
00:34:06,877 --> 00:34:09,539
What are you hitting him for
when you wanna hit me?

413
00:34:09,597 --> 00:34:13,829
- What are you talking about?
- Something's bothering you. I remember.

414
00:34:15,101 --> 00:34:16,966
Okay, yeah.

415
00:34:17,053 --> 00:34:19,351
L... I was trying to tell you something...

416
00:34:19,421 --> 00:34:21,787
Shouldn't we be going?

417
00:34:23,101 --> 00:34:24,830
All right, let's go. Come on.

418
00:34:25,629 --> 00:34:27,790
- All right. Straight ahead.
- Right, Grimm.

419
00:34:27,869 --> 00:34:29,996
I'm glad the son of a bitch robbed us.

420
00:34:30,077 --> 00:34:34,844
It's just another reminder of how happy
and lucky we are to be getting out of here.

421
00:34:34,879 --> 00:34:38,476
But not Woolworth's. You said
we should see as few people as possible.

422
00:34:38,493 --> 00:34:41,621
Go to my apartment.
I left clothes there, men's and women's.

423
00:34:41,661 --> 00:34:44,824
Right, that's better, it's closer.
Take the next big left.

424
00:34:46,141 --> 00:34:48,439
Men's clothes. Whose?

425
00:34:48,509 --> 00:34:51,205
Barry Meyers. I mentioned him.

426
00:34:51,261 --> 00:34:54,560
A guy I should have married.
A guy who wasn't certifiable.

427
00:35:04,285 --> 00:35:06,253
Come off it, pal.

428
00:35:07,037 --> 00:35:09,164
Thank you for getting us out alive.

429
00:35:09,245 --> 00:35:11,577
The owners of the bank
want me to tell you...

430
00:35:11,644 --> 00:35:13,874
...not to expect
any cooperation from them.

431
00:35:15,197 --> 00:35:17,791
I think they're gonna kill you
with the press too.

432
00:35:17,853 --> 00:35:19,878
They say if the clown gets away...

433
00:35:19,965 --> 00:35:24,061
...they owe it to their shareholders
to let the abject humiliation...

434
00:35:24,096 --> 00:35:26,859
...of this whole thing
fall on a public official.

435
00:35:26,909 --> 00:35:29,343
How many shareholders are there?

436
00:35:29,597 --> 00:35:32,259
Just the three, I think.
But thank you very much.

437
00:35:32,317 --> 00:35:36,117
- We really appreciate it.
- See you on the bus.

438
00:35:38,941 --> 00:35:42,240
Oh, my God. Now this one's going.

439
00:35:42,333 --> 00:35:44,858
Tear them down no matter
how great they were.

440
00:35:44,925 --> 00:35:46,358
Chief.

441
00:35:46,460 --> 00:35:48,724
The Peruvian Connection.

442
00:35:48,797 --> 00:35:50,128
The Subway Psycho.

443
00:35:50,973 --> 00:35:53,771
People are gonna remember
what you've done.

444
00:35:53,821 --> 00:35:56,585
What's memorable about a clown
stealing $ 1 million?

445
00:35:59,357 --> 00:36:01,416
Jesus, we gotta get this guy.

446
00:36:05,629 --> 00:36:07,119
Look at this.

447
00:36:11,005 --> 00:36:12,870
Why do they have to do this?

448
00:36:16,157 --> 00:36:19,149
Well, what do I care.
It's not my life's work anymore.

449
00:36:19,197 --> 00:36:22,860
Hey, Grimm, you tried.
You're a good person.

450
00:36:22,877 --> 00:36:26,210
Caring, faithful, concerned.

451
00:36:26,557 --> 00:36:27,922
Aren't you?

452
00:36:28,029 --> 00:36:30,998
- Phyllis, where do you park?
- Just park by the hydrant.

453
00:36:31,037 --> 00:36:32,368
The hydrant?

454
00:36:33,309 --> 00:36:35,573
I'll pay the ticket.

455
00:36:35,741 --> 00:36:38,335
I can't believe the new tenants
dumped this stuff.

456
00:36:38,397 --> 00:36:42,800
- They're not supposed to move till Tuesday.
- Well, we should be out of here by then.

457
00:36:46,205 --> 00:36:48,332
- Give me your sleeve.
- Is that necessary?

458
00:36:48,413 --> 00:36:50,506
We'll miss the complimentary beverage.

459
00:36:50,589 --> 00:36:53,786
Do you want to stand out at the airport?
Barry was 6'4".

460
00:36:53,821 --> 00:36:55,152
Pituitary problem?

461
00:36:55,261 --> 00:36:58,128
Hey, look at this, guys.
I'm gonna get me one of these.

462
00:36:58,173 --> 00:36:59,936
Get yourself three.

463
00:37:00,028 --> 00:37:02,997
It sure would be less itchy
if there's no x-ray machines.

464
00:37:03,037 --> 00:37:05,471
So we could just carry the dough
in a suitcase.

465
00:37:05,532 --> 00:37:09,593
Those darn terrorists who made it tough
on us bank robbers.

466
00:37:10,429 --> 00:37:12,056
It's a pretty nice jacket.

467
00:37:12,156 --> 00:37:15,489
Why did Barry leave this behind,
why didn't he take it with him?

468
00:37:15,517 --> 00:37:16,745
Too rich to care.

469
00:37:16,861 --> 00:37:18,624
There's smoke across the street.

470
00:37:18,845 --> 00:37:22,303
How did he make his money, anyway?
Terminally boring banker-type?

471
00:37:22,333 --> 00:37:24,301
It's black smoke.

472
00:37:24,380 --> 00:37:27,281
Mafia kingpin? Amway?

473
00:37:28,317 --> 00:37:29,978
Pimp?

474
00:37:30,621 --> 00:37:32,748
- Oh, no.
- What, cops?

475
00:37:32,829 --> 00:37:36,265
- No, fire engine.
- The hydrant. Give me your keys.

476
00:37:36,285 --> 00:37:37,718
- Keys.
- Here.

477
00:37:37,820 --> 00:37:39,048
Grimm.

478
00:37:48,957 --> 00:37:51,755
- Get your hands up.
- You must be Mr. Edison.

479
00:37:52,093 --> 00:37:54,027
Get them up!

480
00:37:54,173 --> 00:37:57,142
Mr. Edison, I'm Phyllis Potter,
and this is my apartment.

481
00:37:57,181 --> 00:38:00,275
We were ripped off in the Village.
It's not gonna happen here.

482
00:38:00,317 --> 00:38:01,841
Do we look like criminals?

483
00:38:01,949 --> 00:38:05,180
Do we look like people that are
capable of committing a crime?

484
00:38:05,212 --> 00:38:06,406
I only know what I saw.

485
00:38:06,524 --> 00:38:10,984
When my wife gets here, she'll call the cops.
We'll let them decide. Face the window.

486
00:38:11,019 --> 00:38:15,033
Okay, but it's still our apartment.
We'll have to have you arrested.

487
00:38:15,037 --> 00:38:16,402
Oh, Jesus.

488
00:38:16,509 --> 00:38:19,103
Grimm, our plane takes off in 41 minutes.

489
00:38:19,165 --> 00:38:21,656
Quiet. No codes.

490
00:38:22,749 --> 00:38:26,708
Hey, honey. Ready to celebrate?

491
00:38:26,717 --> 00:38:30,551
- Oh, my God.
- They were taking the TV when I came in.

492
00:38:30,557 --> 00:38:32,286
I was touching it. Kill me.

493
00:38:32,381 --> 00:38:34,679
- Turn around.
- Oh, great, Hal.

494
00:38:35,197 --> 00:38:36,960
For once, it was gonna be fun.

495
00:38:37,053 --> 00:38:41,854
We were gonna eat on the floor,
drink champagne, listen to old records.

496
00:38:41,889 --> 00:38:43,755
Why are you blaming me?

497
00:38:43,837 --> 00:38:47,170
We haven't even moved the bed in,
and already it's the same.

498
00:38:47,196 --> 00:38:49,323
Give credit where it's due,
Mrs. Edison.

499
00:38:49,405 --> 00:38:53,569
Hal made the commitment, didn't he?
He gave up the rent-controlled place.

500
00:38:53,604 --> 00:38:57,227
- Do you know him?
- He's paying 15oo for a one-bedroom.

501
00:38:57,244 --> 00:39:01,146
Fifteen hundred? Try 26oo.

502
00:39:01,757 --> 00:39:04,453
You... You weren't paying 15oo,
were you?

503
00:39:04,732 --> 00:39:08,327
- We were paying 126o.
- Twelve sixty?

504
00:39:08,349 --> 00:39:12,786
Excuse me, I don't know you very well,
but you're crazy if you gave this place up.

505
00:39:12,821 --> 00:39:14,288
Maybe we are crazy.

506
00:39:14,588 --> 00:39:17,523
We bought a farmhouse, near Woodstock.

507
00:39:17,564 --> 00:39:20,294
It's rustic, kind of a fixer.

508
00:39:20,348 --> 00:39:23,044
But the payments are 3oo a month.

509
00:39:23,549 --> 00:39:26,017
We just had to try.

510
00:39:29,053 --> 00:39:33,353
I suppose you don't believe that either,
Edison! That people would go and do that!

511
00:39:33,388 --> 00:39:37,675
For your information, I was at Woodstock.

512
00:39:38,172 --> 00:39:39,696
I don't judge you, Hal.

513
00:39:40,285 --> 00:39:42,116
Really, I don't.

514
00:39:42,620 --> 00:39:47,057
But from Woodstock
to Charles Bronson in 2o years?

515
00:39:47,092 --> 00:39:48,265
Good one.

516
00:39:52,220 --> 00:39:53,983
Look.

517
00:39:55,260 --> 00:39:57,387
Grab it.

518
00:39:58,365 --> 00:40:00,856
Oh, damn it.

519
00:40:15,293 --> 00:40:17,557
You can shoot us now.

520
00:40:17,629 --> 00:40:19,756
I've put the gun down.

521
00:40:20,605 --> 00:40:23,267
No hard feelings?

522
00:40:24,412 --> 00:40:28,371
These are the names and numbers
and preliminary statements of the hostages.

523
00:40:28,381 --> 00:40:32,010
"Clown seemed harmless until
he harassed blond hostage."

524
00:40:32,029 --> 00:40:35,692
Yes, sir. Apparently, he made
some sexual overtures, things like that.

525
00:40:38,652 --> 00:40:40,176
I don't see her.

526
00:40:40,284 --> 00:40:43,549
- Don't see who?
- The blond. Where is she?

527
00:40:46,332 --> 00:40:48,732
I was talking to her myself
when she came out.

528
00:40:48,797 --> 00:40:51,288
- All the hostages are here.
- They're all here.

529
00:40:51,357 --> 00:40:54,918
No. Where's the whiny guy?

530
00:40:54,940 --> 00:40:56,202
"He's an animal."

531
00:40:56,637 --> 00:40:58,798
The one that came out with her.

532
00:40:58,876 --> 00:41:01,504
They were the second and third ones out.

533
00:41:04,284 --> 00:41:06,878
Oh, Jesus.

534
00:41:10,013 --> 00:41:12,413
The lumberjack guy...
He was the first one out.

535
00:41:12,477 --> 00:41:15,708
- In all that chaos, a few wandered away...
- It was utter chaos.

536
00:41:15,740 --> 00:41:19,073
- But we got everybody's name and number.
- We got all that stuff.

537
00:41:19,101 --> 00:41:24,266
Yeah, get me the news footage on those
three hostages who were released. Right.

538
00:41:24,301 --> 00:41:26,121
I said, "It's all over, Chuckles."

539
00:41:26,204 --> 00:41:29,867
And wrestled him. But he got a gal
in his sights, and I had to let up.

540
00:41:29,884 --> 00:41:32,216
That's when he coldcocked me.
Son of a bitch.

541
00:41:32,285 --> 00:41:35,652
Look at this video so we can
put out an APB on these robbers.

542
00:41:35,868 --> 00:41:38,098
- Robbers, plural?
- They all coldcocked me.

543
00:41:38,172 --> 00:41:40,299
Three of them there, shouting with glee.

544
00:41:40,381 --> 00:41:42,008
- Taxi!
- Taxi!

545
00:41:42,109 --> 00:41:45,806
- Please!
- $ 1 o, ooo for a taxi!

546
00:41:45,820 --> 00:41:47,879
And a blowjob!

547
00:41:50,204 --> 00:41:53,037
- Can we just calm down.
- We'll never make the flight.

548
00:41:53,084 --> 00:41:56,315
We'll have to sail a raft to Fiji
like Thor Heyerdahl.

549
00:41:56,349 --> 00:42:00,342
I have made another reservation
on the 11:oo to Martinique.

550
00:42:00,349 --> 00:42:04,115
- You never mentioned an 11:oo flight.
- I never thought we'd need it.

551
00:42:04,125 --> 00:42:06,855
But I don't know anything
about Martinique.

552
00:42:07,517 --> 00:42:09,041
What did you know about Fiji?

553
00:42:09,725 --> 00:42:10,953
Nothing, really.

554
00:42:11,580 --> 00:42:13,047
Okay.

555
00:42:14,397 --> 00:42:16,490
Did you book another flight after that?

556
00:42:16,572 --> 00:42:18,802
Let's just try to make the 11:oo, okay?

557
00:42:18,877 --> 00:42:21,641
Why, do they know about us yet?

558
00:42:21,692 --> 00:42:26,652
Well, by now, Rotzinger has probably
figured out it was the first three hostages.

559
00:42:26,687 --> 00:42:28,111
Oh, Grimm.

560
00:42:28,381 --> 00:42:30,975
Grimm, I cannot go to prison.

561
00:42:31,036 --> 00:42:33,436
Don't worry about it. We were disguised.

562
00:42:34,237 --> 00:42:36,831
- Taxi!
- You never mentioned Rotzinger.

563
00:42:36,892 --> 00:42:38,917
You never mentioned Martinique.

564
00:42:39,004 --> 00:42:41,199
What else haven't you mentioned?

565
00:42:41,629 --> 00:42:44,928
- Everything you told me is a lie, isn't it?
- Are you all right?

566
00:42:44,957 --> 00:42:48,324
Am l...? You think this is fun,
a night on the town.

567
00:42:48,349 --> 00:42:50,783
No, I think it's a lot more exciting
than that.

568
00:42:50,844 --> 00:42:53,745
You used to think so too.
We couldn't discuss this plan...

569
00:42:53,789 --> 00:42:57,657
...unless there was a bedroom close by.
- Before I realized what you are.

570
00:42:57,660 --> 00:42:58,991
What am I?

571
00:42:59,101 --> 00:43:03,037
You're a world-class bank robber,
drunk on your own power and expertise.

572
00:43:03,072 --> 00:43:05,699
- And Loomis thinks so too.
- Taxi.

573
00:43:06,173 --> 00:43:07,970
Taxi.

574
00:43:08,157 --> 00:43:12,025
Look, I don't know where this
"world-class bank robber" thing came from.

575
00:43:12,476 --> 00:43:15,036
Okay, I did rob a bank, but so did you.

576
00:43:15,100 --> 00:43:18,831
Isn't that what we planned for six months
in your bedroom?

577
00:43:18,844 --> 00:43:21,142
And now if... When we get a cab...

578
00:43:21,212 --> 00:43:26,741
...we can complete the plan and live out
our lives with a modicum of dignity.

579
00:43:43,548 --> 00:43:47,728
Please, God! We need a cab!

580
00:43:47,763 --> 00:43:51,908
One lousy, fucking cab!

581
00:44:04,733 --> 00:44:05,961
Yes!

582
00:44:12,732 --> 00:44:14,199
To the airport, please.

583
00:44:14,300 --> 00:44:18,168
<i>All right, let's take another call.
Line seven. Steve, from Staten Island.</i>

584
00:44:18,173 --> 00:44:22,166
<i>- What's on your mind tonight?
- I wanted to talk about that bank robbery.</i>

585
00:44:22,173 --> 00:44:25,301
<i>- What about it?
- Was this clown such a bad guy?</i>

586
00:44:25,340 --> 00:44:27,331
<i>I mean, he had a great sense of humor.</i>

587
00:44:27,421 --> 00:44:29,981
<i>He wasn't another junkie
with a homemade 9 mm.</i>

588
00:44:30,045 --> 00:44:33,071
<i>- He was okay.
- Steve, you must be a scumbag like him.</i>

589
00:44:33,116 --> 00:44:37,644
<i>I say, hang the clown, then pull his pants
down to set an example. You're out of here.</i>

590
00:44:37,679 --> 00:44:40,223
How could he say a thing like that?

591
00:44:47,708 --> 00:44:50,199
- He's asking, "Where to?"
- Oh, God.

592
00:44:50,269 --> 00:44:55,434
He just means which airport, that's all.
Kennedy. JFK.

593
00:44:58,397 --> 00:45:02,026
- I'm sorry I got so crazy.
- What did Loomis say to get you so upset?

594
00:45:02,044 --> 00:45:05,673
Oh, nothing. No, he's completely loyal
to you. And you are to him.

595
00:45:05,692 --> 00:45:07,956
Kind of like father and son, huh?

596
00:45:08,028 --> 00:45:13,364
You didn't mention Rotzinger or Martinique
because the plan was perfect...

597
00:45:13,399 --> 00:45:17,507
...and you didn't wanna worry me
with unlikely contingencies, right?

598
00:45:18,972 --> 00:45:21,907
I know I've been especially moody.

599
00:45:21,949 --> 00:45:24,383
Not so as you'd notice.

600
00:45:24,988 --> 00:45:28,321
And I know it's not exactly
reasonable to expect...

601
00:45:28,348 --> 00:45:32,148
...a lot of attention
under the circumstances.

602
00:45:32,157 --> 00:45:34,489
But you see...

603
00:45:35,868 --> 00:45:38,701
Jesus. The goddamn airport!

604
00:45:38,748 --> 00:45:41,979
What, do you got shit in your ears?
Come on.

605
00:45:42,012 --> 00:45:45,311
All right, easy.
He may be a guest in our country.

606
00:45:45,341 --> 00:45:46,933
<i>Friend...</i>

607
00:45:47,484 --> 00:45:49,611
Kennedy. Here, look.

608
00:45:49,692 --> 00:45:52,252
Kennedy Airport. Look.

609
00:45:54,268 --> 00:45:55,826
Yeah, he's got it.

610
00:45:55,932 --> 00:45:59,595
Oh, great. Why don't you take us
straight to Sing Sing.

611
00:45:59,612 --> 00:46:02,843
- Please don't say that. You'll upset Loomis.
- Oh, God forbid.

612
00:46:14,493 --> 00:46:17,121
It's red. Stop!

613
00:46:17,180 --> 00:46:18,613
Stop!

614
00:46:18,716 --> 00:46:21,082
You don't even understand colors,
do you?

615
00:46:21,148 --> 00:46:24,140
You don't know red from hell!

616
00:46:26,236 --> 00:46:28,864
There's a real cab up there. Stop!

617
00:46:28,924 --> 00:46:31,085
- Taxi!
- Loomis!

618
00:46:41,564 --> 00:46:44,965
- That guy must have wanted a paper bad.
- That's a bad place to be.

619
00:46:44,988 --> 00:46:46,853
Loomis. Loomis.

620
00:46:46,940 --> 00:46:49,500
Hey, Linda, hurry up,
I think this guy's dead.

621
00:46:49,980 --> 00:46:53,677
You hear me? It's a dead man.

622
00:46:53,692 --> 00:46:55,785
Thirty-eight eighty-two.

623
00:46:55,868 --> 00:46:57,529
Send a squad car now!

624
00:46:58,588 --> 00:47:00,112
Looks like he's bleeding.

625
00:47:00,221 --> 00:47:01,848
Loomis.

626
00:47:02,364 --> 00:47:03,991
Loomis.

627
00:47:05,436 --> 00:47:08,405
I really liked him. I did.

628
00:47:36,924 --> 00:47:41,293
So I says to him, "Are you gonna behave?"
And from out of nowhere comes this knife.

629
00:47:41,328 --> 00:47:44,677
I think it was a bowie knife,
and I hate knives.

630
00:47:44,700 --> 00:47:47,294
Dennis, the news footage
didn't help me very much.

631
00:47:47,356 --> 00:47:50,018
I wanted it an hour ago.

632
00:47:53,692 --> 00:47:55,489
Where'd you get this, a matchbook?

633
00:47:55,580 --> 00:47:58,276
It's perfect, if you wanna pick up
Paul Bunyan.

634
00:47:58,332 --> 00:48:00,664
It's based, in part,
on our own descriptions.

635
00:48:00,732 --> 00:48:03,929
That clown was no clown.

636
00:48:03,964 --> 00:48:05,955
Knew we'd be too obsessed...

637
00:48:06,044 --> 00:48:08,171
...by the perpetrator inside the bank...

638
00:48:08,252 --> 00:48:12,985
...to see much more than a beard or a blond
or a whiny jerk. What do you got?

639
00:48:13,020 --> 00:48:15,447
Involving two men and a woman,
here's what's up:

640
00:48:15,516 --> 00:48:19,714
19oo hours, a car containing two men
and a woman crashed into the Pierce Hotel.

641
00:48:19,749 --> 00:48:23,337
- The passengers fled before we got there.
- Dispatch a car. What else?

642
00:48:23,356 --> 00:48:25,824
That's it involving two men
and a woman.

643
00:48:25,884 --> 00:48:30,617
Two more liquor stores and a Laundromat
were hit by copycat clowns.

644
00:48:32,476 --> 00:48:35,877
You realize they're probably
somewhere in the Third World by now.

645
00:48:35,900 --> 00:48:37,800
Yes, sir. Someplace nice.

646
00:48:37,884 --> 00:48:41,650
All we've got going for us is the city.

647
00:48:41,660 --> 00:48:46,256
Our only hope is that they're mired down in
the same shit you and I wade in every day.

648
00:48:46,291 --> 00:48:49,205
Why do I still want this fucking job?

649
00:48:49,244 --> 00:48:52,236
Can't I imagine a more inspired destiny
for myself?

650
00:48:52,284 --> 00:48:53,876
Sir, don't talk like that.

651
00:48:53,980 --> 00:48:57,939
Here's another one. A man jumped from
a moving cab into a newspaper stand.

652
00:48:57,949 --> 00:49:01,180
There were two other passengers in the car,
a man and a woman.

653
00:49:01,212 --> 00:49:04,340
He jumped from a moving cab.

654
00:49:04,380 --> 00:49:05,677
That's panic.

655
00:49:05,788 --> 00:49:08,382
That's somebody on the lam.

656
00:49:08,444 --> 00:49:11,902
Goddamn, if that doesn't sound like
the guy who hit that car horn.

657
00:49:11,932 --> 00:49:14,298
- When was that?
- 2o35.

658
00:49:14,364 --> 00:49:17,561
- We're not even on the scene yet, sir.
- It's them.

659
00:49:17,788 --> 00:49:19,779
It's them.

660
00:49:20,508 --> 00:49:23,341
Send all nearby units to the scene.

661
00:49:29,884 --> 00:49:31,777
Loomis.

662
00:49:32,060 --> 00:49:34,255
Loomis.

663
00:49:38,300 --> 00:49:40,268
Did we get the cab?

664
00:49:42,908 --> 00:49:44,637
Are you gonna hit me now?

665
00:49:44,732 --> 00:49:48,498
No, but if your leg is broken,
we'll have to destroy you.

666
00:49:48,508 --> 00:49:50,373
Can you get up now, pal?

667
00:49:53,660 --> 00:49:56,128
Too bad. It looked fierce.

668
00:49:56,796 --> 00:49:58,889
Count from 1 o backwards.

669
00:49:58,972 --> 00:50:00,599
Ten.

670
00:50:00,700 --> 00:50:02,759
That's great. Forget it, that's enough.

671
00:50:02,844 --> 00:50:06,007
Nine, eight...

672
00:50:06,044 --> 00:50:07,636
...seven...

673
00:50:33,244 --> 00:50:36,077
- Come on, relax.
- The gun, the gun!

674
00:50:37,340 --> 00:50:39,672
- Gun, the gun.
- Hey.

675
00:50:40,476 --> 00:50:43,639
Oh, nice. Professor Henry Higgins
is gonna spot us.

676
00:50:45,948 --> 00:50:47,882
We're gonna go in here.

677
00:50:59,740 --> 00:51:02,709
This ain't my dick in your back.

678
00:51:03,548 --> 00:51:05,413
That's a relief.

679
00:51:08,860 --> 00:51:10,851
We came...

680
00:51:11,996 --> 00:51:13,224
...about the money.

681
00:51:14,076 --> 00:51:16,306
What's that walking corpse say?

682
00:51:17,020 --> 00:51:19,284
He said they come about the money.

683
00:51:20,060 --> 00:51:22,290
Ask him what money, asshole.

684
00:51:22,364 --> 00:51:24,958
What money, asshole?

685
00:51:26,108 --> 00:51:28,372
Incredible. They're playing games.

686
00:51:28,636 --> 00:51:30,126
Yeah.

687
00:51:30,428 --> 00:51:33,295
Tell him you're gonna play games
on his fucking head.

688
00:51:33,340 --> 00:51:35,774
I'm gonna play games
on your fucking head.

689
00:51:36,412 --> 00:51:38,642
You must hate this warehouse.

690
00:51:38,908 --> 00:51:41,934
Because it's gonna be a three-alarm job
after tomorrow.

691
00:51:42,492 --> 00:51:45,620
Johnny. Come here.

692
00:51:47,420 --> 00:51:48,648
Come here.

693
00:51:50,492 --> 00:51:51,857
What?

694
00:51:53,084 --> 00:51:55,109
What the hell are you doing?

695
00:51:55,580 --> 00:51:57,878
I have no idea.

696
00:51:57,948 --> 00:51:59,609
I don't know.

697
00:52:00,028 --> 00:52:02,895
- Go ask him.
- You want me to ask him?

698
00:52:08,156 --> 00:52:11,319
Mr. Skelton wants to know
how come he don't know you.

699
00:52:12,731 --> 00:52:15,325
- Because I'm new.
- Because he's new.

700
00:52:15,388 --> 00:52:19,154
Tell him Lombino didn't say nothing
to me about no new bagman.

701
00:52:20,156 --> 00:52:24,388
- Lombino didn't say nothing...
- Mr. Lombino, huh?

702
00:52:25,084 --> 00:52:26,574
Mr. Lombino!

703
00:52:26,684 --> 00:52:32,020
Since when does a wiseguy like you
deserve an explanation from a giant...

704
00:52:32,055 --> 00:52:33,625
...like Mr. Lombino?

705
00:52:33,724 --> 00:52:37,592
Mr. Lombino didn't say nothing
to Mr. Skelton...

706
00:52:37,596 --> 00:52:40,030
...about no new...
- Enough already, Johnny.

707
00:52:40,092 --> 00:52:43,823
- Don't you see me standing right here?
- Yeah, all right. I'm sorry.

708
00:52:43,836 --> 00:52:45,463
All right.

709
00:52:45,564 --> 00:52:47,293
What happened to Mario?

710
00:52:47,388 --> 00:52:48,946
Mario.

711
00:52:50,812 --> 00:52:52,302
Somebody dared him.

712
00:52:52,412 --> 00:52:54,676
So he threw Earl here
out of a moving car.

713
00:52:56,092 --> 00:52:58,458
Same spot he done Johnny.

714
00:52:59,163 --> 00:53:03,099
- He must love that spot.
- The man is an animal. He's sick.

715
00:53:03,100 --> 00:53:06,331
All right. I'll give you the money.

716
00:53:06,940 --> 00:53:08,168
Soon as I call Lom...

717
00:53:08,796 --> 00:53:10,024
Mr. Lombino.

718
00:53:10,235 --> 00:53:11,463
To check you out.

719
00:53:14,908 --> 00:53:19,072
Fine. Actually, perfect.

720
00:53:19,196 --> 00:53:20,823
I can hear Mr. Lombino now:

721
00:53:20,924 --> 00:53:24,917
"Skelton just called me to check on Chip."

722
00:53:24,924 --> 00:53:28,018
Mr. Lombino, please. Skelton.

723
00:53:28,060 --> 00:53:29,789
"I guess Chip wasn't so hot.

724
00:53:29,883 --> 00:53:33,910
Guess I'll have to put that animal Mario
back on Skelton."

725
00:53:35,164 --> 00:53:37,496
No. Wait. Uncle Mike. Uncle Mike.

726
00:53:37,884 --> 00:53:42,344
Mr. Skelton. No, wait a minute. We don't
want Mario to come, the bald giant...

727
00:53:42,379 --> 00:53:45,631
...with stupid sunglasses,
knocking everybody around for kicks.

728
00:53:45,660 --> 00:53:48,060
Nobody's stupid enough to do this
for a few K.

729
00:53:48,123 --> 00:53:52,150
<i>They gotta know Mario's gonna
pull out their livers. I mean, you know...</i>

730
00:53:52,156 --> 00:53:55,683
<i>I think that I might be right on this
so, you know...</i>

731
00:54:02,652 --> 00:54:04,882
Six thousand. Short shipment.

732
00:54:04,955 --> 00:54:07,651
Thanks. Come on, Earl.

733
00:54:07,708 --> 00:54:11,644
You know, when I first heard the rumors
about Lombino being back in town...

734
00:54:11,679 --> 00:54:15,205
...I said, "No way." The man
never leaves his haven in Nevada.

735
00:54:15,228 --> 00:54:18,391
But now that I see you,
I know it must be true.

736
00:54:18,428 --> 00:54:21,261
He's come to put his house in order.

737
00:54:21,308 --> 00:54:23,003
And that's why the man is king.

738
00:54:23,100 --> 00:54:26,331
Drugs, protection, you name it.
Lombino is king.

739
00:54:29,915 --> 00:54:31,382
- Tell him I said so.
- Yeah.

740
00:54:31,483 --> 00:54:33,713
Anything Lombino touches turns to gold.

741
00:54:33,788 --> 00:54:37,053
King Lombino.
That's why he's the king, right?

742
00:54:37,083 --> 00:54:39,210
- Tell him I said so.
- I will, John.

743
00:54:39,292 --> 00:54:42,159
See you later. Take care of your head.

744
00:54:42,299 --> 00:54:45,860
Grimm, baby, I never thought
we'd get out of there. Never.

745
00:54:45,883 --> 00:54:47,111
Oh, honey.

746
00:54:47,228 --> 00:54:49,196
Phyllis is back.

747
00:54:49,819 --> 00:54:52,481
You just ripped off the Mob.

748
00:54:52,540 --> 00:54:53,939
You were born for this.

749
00:54:54,044 --> 00:54:56,945
Oh, Grimm. It must be in your genes.

750
00:54:58,844 --> 00:55:01,039
This is lucky. Let's make this.

751
00:55:05,020 --> 00:55:08,285
I can make it. I can make it.

752
00:55:11,260 --> 00:55:12,955
I can't make it.

753
00:55:13,052 --> 00:55:14,952
<i>I can't...</i>

754
00:55:18,684 --> 00:55:21,312
okay, I can make it.

755
00:55:31,611 --> 00:55:33,306
What's that smell?

756
00:55:33,404 --> 00:55:35,895
Used wine. Do you go to the airport?

757
00:55:35,964 --> 00:55:39,229
- Near the airport.
- Great. We're on a roll.

758
00:55:39,260 --> 00:55:41,057
You have exact change, right?

759
00:55:41,980 --> 00:55:44,073
Give him $ 1 oo.

760
00:55:45,147 --> 00:55:46,637
Hurry.

761
00:55:46,748 --> 00:55:48,375
Hurry.

762
00:55:49,468 --> 00:55:50,799
That isn't exact change.

763
00:55:51,836 --> 00:55:55,738
Have you looked back there?
I don't think anybody's going to object.

764
00:55:55,740 --> 00:55:57,332
I look back there every night.

765
00:55:57,435 --> 00:56:00,802
That's why I conduct my own affairs
in a hygienic fashion.

766
00:56:00,828 --> 00:56:03,820
I leave this stop in one minute
and 45 seconds.

767
00:56:03,868 --> 00:56:05,836
Exact change, or off.

768
00:56:06,204 --> 00:56:09,298
All right. Give me a minute.
I'll go get change.

769
00:56:09,563 --> 00:56:12,225
I'll give you a minute and 28 seconds.

770
00:56:16,092 --> 00:56:18,390
Loomis. Can't you kneel?

771
00:56:18,460 --> 00:56:20,553
No. I can sit.

772
00:56:20,636 --> 00:56:24,436
You can't sit. Not till you pay the fare.

773
00:56:30,236 --> 00:56:32,204
- I'm sorry.
- Watch where you're going.

774
00:56:32,283 --> 00:56:35,878
- I'm sorry. I was going the wrong way.
- No problem.

775
00:56:42,460 --> 00:56:45,224
- I just need some change.
- Hey, wait your turn.

776
00:56:45,371 --> 00:56:47,669
You have to buy something, anyway.

777
00:56:54,683 --> 00:56:57,083
Fifty-two seconds.

778
00:57:04,027 --> 00:57:06,188
Ninety-eight sixty-two.

779
00:57:06,268 --> 00:57:09,260
Oh, and I need a can of Maxwell House.

780
00:57:09,308 --> 00:57:13,369
No, no. The decaf, over there.

781
00:57:13,371 --> 00:57:14,929
There it is.

782
00:57:26,555 --> 00:57:28,523
Yeah, that's it.

783
00:57:36,251 --> 00:57:38,014
Oh, no.

784
00:57:38,108 --> 00:57:39,769
No, no, no.

785
00:57:44,572 --> 00:57:47,097
Oh, you're awfully sweet to do this.
Thank you.

786
00:57:47,163 --> 00:57:48,391
I can do.

787
00:58:03,483 --> 00:58:05,348
He ain't gonna make it.

788
00:58:09,116 --> 00:58:10,640
Twenty-six seconds.

789
00:58:28,603 --> 00:58:30,571
- Get the hell out of here!
- Mario, no!

790
00:58:30,652 --> 00:58:31,880
How about this guy?

791
00:58:31,995 --> 00:58:33,622
Oh, I can't look!

792
00:58:33,724 --> 00:58:36,192
I don't know. That's him right there!

793
00:58:38,875 --> 00:58:41,173
You son of a bitch!

794
00:58:41,243 --> 00:58:44,440
- That's it.
- No, wait! No, please, wait!

795
00:58:50,683 --> 00:58:53,015
Close the door.
He's waiting for another bus.

796
00:58:53,084 --> 00:58:54,915
The guy's a thief!

797
00:58:55,004 --> 00:58:57,837
- Close the door. Let's go.
- Behind the white line.

798
00:58:58,427 --> 00:59:00,224
He stole...!

799
00:59:05,883 --> 00:59:08,681
- I got him.
- He's a thief, he stole something from me!

800
00:59:08,731 --> 00:59:10,392
He jumped from the cab?

801
00:59:10,491 --> 00:59:15,360
My boss'll have your job!
How's it going, Rotzinger?

802
00:59:15,395 --> 00:59:17,690
- Unbelievable.
- You know him?

803
00:59:17,756 --> 00:59:20,725
Mario Monetti,
bagman for Vince Lombino.

804
00:59:20,763 --> 00:59:22,822
Lombino? He's in Nevada, right?

805
00:59:22,908 --> 00:59:25,672
Yeah, supposedly somewhere in Nevada.

806
00:59:25,724 --> 00:59:28,215
He got out just as I was about
to collar him.

807
00:59:28,283 --> 00:59:32,845
Still takes more out of this town in a day
than the clown could get in a week.

808
00:59:33,275 --> 00:59:36,005
You're sure that's the guy
that jumped from the cab?

809
00:59:36,059 --> 00:59:38,254
The cabbie ID'd him, sir.

810
00:59:47,291 --> 00:59:48,349
Come on.

811
00:59:52,571 --> 00:59:54,505
May I ask you a question?

812
00:59:59,228 --> 01:00:03,289
- Get behind the white line.
- Oh, please. Come on. Go, just go.

813
01:00:05,788 --> 01:00:08,723
My mom used to do this.

814
01:00:08,859 --> 01:00:11,327
Just like this.

815
01:00:14,043 --> 01:00:16,637
You should have a kid, Phyllis.

816
01:00:17,883 --> 01:00:20,215
Funny you should say that.

817
01:00:25,596 --> 01:00:27,188
Really?

818
01:00:27,291 --> 01:00:29,350
Sit back.

819
01:00:29,436 --> 01:00:32,803
- Well, Grimm didn't tell me.
- Grimm doesn't know.

820
01:00:32,828 --> 01:00:35,854
I didn't want to tell him
till after the job.

821
01:00:35,899 --> 01:00:37,958
Well, tell him now.

822
01:00:38,396 --> 01:00:40,762
I'm not gonna tell him at all.

823
01:00:42,555 --> 01:00:44,455
Don't you love him?

824
01:00:51,803 --> 01:00:53,964
My sister always told me...

825
01:00:54,044 --> 01:00:56,877
...there's the type of guy
you're crazy about...

826
01:00:57,499 --> 01:00:59,524
...and there's the type you marry.

827
01:00:59,612 --> 01:01:03,343
Because if he's that exciting,
you just can't trust him.

828
01:01:03,356 --> 01:01:06,723
But I told her, you can have both.

829
01:01:07,036 --> 01:01:09,527
And when I met Grimm,
I thought I did.

830
01:01:09,595 --> 01:01:14,259
But there's a limit. I mean,
you said it yourself, Loomis.

831
01:01:14,294 --> 01:01:15,702
He's born for this.

832
01:01:15,803 --> 01:01:18,738
I'm just one of his gang now.

833
01:01:18,779 --> 01:01:23,307
Oh, God. Something I said,
you're gonna let that influence you?

834
01:01:24,764 --> 01:01:26,459
Oh, this is all my fault.

835
01:01:26,555 --> 01:01:30,013
Oh, no. Come here.

836
01:01:32,283 --> 01:01:34,478
Nothing's your fault.

837
01:01:35,740 --> 01:01:38,368
Except you honked the fucking horn.

838
01:01:39,963 --> 01:01:42,727
- When you say "near the airport"...?
- Point 48 miles.

839
01:01:42,779 --> 01:01:45,771
- All right. When do we get there?
- 223o hours.

840
01:01:45,819 --> 01:01:48,185
- When is that in human time?
- 1 o:3o.

841
01:01:48,251 --> 01:01:51,118
- Say you had to walk it.
- With that injured individual?

842
01:01:51,163 --> 01:01:54,098
- I can't give you a precise figure.
- Make a guess.

843
01:01:54,139 --> 01:01:57,597
- Twenty-one minutes.
- Thank you.

844
01:01:58,620 --> 01:02:02,351
This isn't my usual route.
My husband's in intensive care.

845
01:02:02,364 --> 01:02:06,391
- You're gonna even that out, aren't you?
- Mind your own business.

846
01:02:11,771 --> 01:02:13,204
What'd he say?

847
01:02:13,307 --> 01:02:18,404
His estimate, which I accept, gets us
to the terminal at nine minutes of 11.

848
01:02:18,439 --> 01:02:22,299
Nine minutes?
We'll have 9 months... Minutes?

849
01:02:22,780 --> 01:02:25,214
How come I've heard that name
"Lombino" before?

850
01:02:25,275 --> 01:02:26,469
You remember this guy.

851
01:02:26,587 --> 01:02:30,956
He shot out his brother's eyeball over
a plate of Fra Diavolo sauce at Umberto's.

852
01:02:30,991 --> 01:02:34,739
I can't believe our luck,
to walk into his place, all unsuspecting.

853
01:02:34,748 --> 01:02:35,976
His place?

854
01:02:36,091 --> 01:02:40,323
You've walked into his places
all unsuspecting many, many times.

855
01:02:40,358 --> 01:02:43,183
He owns restaurants, bars, supermarkets.

856
01:02:43,227 --> 01:02:45,855
The man owns preschools in this town.

857
01:02:49,404 --> 01:02:52,100
Do you work for the clown
or does he work for you?

858
01:02:52,155 --> 01:02:54,521
Does the clown work for Lombino too?

859
01:02:54,587 --> 01:02:56,111
What clown?

860
01:02:56,219 --> 01:02:57,914
Very convincing, Monetti.

861
01:02:58,011 --> 01:03:00,445
I guess we should apologize
and let you go now.

862
01:03:00,507 --> 01:03:02,236
Yeah, right.

863
01:03:02,715 --> 01:03:05,684
Get over there, scumbag.
Get up there.

864
01:03:08,379 --> 01:03:11,314
He's in on it, sir.
He wouldn't tell us a goddamn thing.

865
01:03:11,355 --> 01:03:14,290
You idiot. This man doesn't speak
a word of English.

866
01:03:14,331 --> 01:03:18,461
Come on... Here. Relax, fella. Sit down.

867
01:03:19,195 --> 01:03:22,426
Didn't I tell you to get me
an interpreter?

868
01:03:22,779 --> 01:03:25,111
I thought you said "interrogator."

869
01:03:27,163 --> 01:03:28,494
That's all he says.

870
01:03:28,603 --> 01:03:32,869
Come on. Give me the keys to the cuffs.
Get him a soda, will you?

871
01:03:33,883 --> 01:03:37,614
Probably left your own country to escape
just this type of persecution.

872
01:03:37,627 --> 01:03:39,492
Damn it. Get me an interpreter.

873
01:03:39,580 --> 01:03:43,539
Don't you realize the robbers told
this man their destination?

874
01:03:43,547 --> 01:03:46,675
Even if they did, sir,
he wouldn't have understood a word.

875
01:03:46,715 --> 01:03:51,584
- I don't even know what language he talks.
- Get me an interpreter!

876
01:03:52,316 --> 01:03:54,944
Here, fella. Drink that.

877
01:03:55,323 --> 01:03:56,813
All right.

878
01:04:00,251 --> 01:04:02,344
Who was the clown? Tell me now.

879
01:04:02,427 --> 01:04:04,452
What the hell is this, Rotzinger?

880
01:04:04,540 --> 01:04:06,974
Since when is it illegal to run for a bus?

881
01:04:11,579 --> 01:04:13,979
- A bus?
- Yeah.

882
01:04:14,043 --> 01:04:16,307
Since when is that a crime? A bus.

883
01:04:33,659 --> 01:04:35,957
They're on a "blufftoney."

884
01:04:48,027 --> 01:04:49,927
I don't have time for this.

885
01:04:50,427 --> 01:04:53,658
Driver, I'm a little disappointed in you!

886
01:05:00,635 --> 01:05:02,000
He wasn't really awake.

887
01:05:02,715 --> 01:05:05,809
Don't you think we should
put him on formula?

888
01:05:06,299 --> 01:05:07,698
By the way...

889
01:05:08,219 --> 01:05:09,948
...how do you feel about kids?

890
01:05:10,555 --> 01:05:12,216
How can you ask me that now?

891
01:05:12,923 --> 01:05:14,390
I'm sorry.

892
01:05:16,507 --> 01:05:19,670
I happen to think the slammer
is a bad environment for them.

893
01:05:19,899 --> 01:05:22,595
Don't pop a stitch.
We're on our way to the airport.

894
01:05:22,651 --> 01:05:25,745
- Near the airport.
- Loomis is asleep. He can't do anything.

895
01:05:25,788 --> 01:05:29,884
- Except blurt out a total confession.
- You think that's gonna matter here?

896
01:05:29,919 --> 01:05:31,612
Come on. Relax.

897
01:05:31,707 --> 01:05:33,368
We're home free.

898
01:05:34,171 --> 01:05:35,638
Grimm...

899
01:05:36,539 --> 01:05:38,666
...I'm not coming with you.

900
01:05:40,283 --> 01:05:41,807
What?

901
01:05:43,259 --> 01:05:44,248
Jesus!

902
01:05:49,691 --> 01:05:51,989
No. No, son.
I don't have time for this.

903
01:05:52,059 --> 01:05:54,823
- You poor son of a bitch. Come here.
- Him?

904
01:05:55,355 --> 01:05:57,152
Come on. I got a schedule to keep.

905
01:05:57,243 --> 01:06:00,110
- What can I do to help?
- Behind the white line!

906
01:06:00,155 --> 01:06:02,214
- Listen, I'll pay his fare.
- Fine.

907
01:06:02,299 --> 01:06:04,893
- You have exact change?
- You better get some help!

908
01:06:04,955 --> 01:06:07,788
- You've become Ralph Kramden's evil twin.
- All right.

909
01:06:07,835 --> 01:06:09,564
- Come on, son. Come on.
- Look.

910
01:06:09,659 --> 01:06:14,596
There's $6ooo here. Okay? It's real. I know
how this city degrades the individual.

911
01:06:14,631 --> 01:06:16,216
- It is appalling.
- Come on.

912
01:06:16,315 --> 01:06:21,150
Take this and start a new life for yourself.
Somewhere off this bus, okay?

913
01:06:21,185 --> 01:06:23,640
Come on! You're gonna break your guitar.
Come on.

914
01:06:23,707 --> 01:06:25,265
There you go. Come on.

915
01:06:25,371 --> 01:06:28,636
We got a schedule. Come on.
Let's move. Come on.

916
01:06:30,267 --> 01:06:33,600
We will quietly pull over and board
all Number Nine buses.

917
01:06:33,627 --> 01:06:36,391
We do not want another
hostage situation.

918
01:06:48,187 --> 01:06:50,621
Is this the kind of person that you are?

919
01:06:50,683 --> 01:06:54,847
We lose a little time, and all of a sudden
it's every girl for herself.

920
01:06:54,882 --> 01:06:56,401
Yeah, that's me.

921
01:06:57,083 --> 01:07:00,177
Well, if you stay behind,
you're gonna get caught.

922
01:07:00,219 --> 01:07:02,380
I'll take my chances.

923
01:07:02,619 --> 01:07:06,612
Why don't you tell me what I've done?
What is it that you want?

924
01:07:06,619 --> 01:07:08,985
I just want you to leave me alone.

925
01:07:09,691 --> 01:07:12,489
Move it! Today!

926
01:07:25,723 --> 01:07:29,215
However, I will stay with you
a little while longer.

927
01:07:44,091 --> 01:07:46,423
The thing is, Loomis,
we lost a little time.

928
01:07:46,491 --> 01:07:48,459
Do you think you can walk any faster?

929
01:07:48,539 --> 01:07:50,507
I'm sorry, Grimm.

930
01:07:50,843 --> 01:07:52,743
I can't.

931
01:07:53,371 --> 01:07:57,034
- You're not gonna hit me again, are you?
- Nobody's gonna hurt you.

932
01:07:57,051 --> 01:08:01,385
- Again? I haven't hit anybody since I was 9.
- Yeah, but it was me you hit.

933
01:08:01,420 --> 01:08:04,238
You threatened him,
and he's been through a lot.

934
01:08:04,283 --> 01:08:05,841
Oh, are you still here?

935
01:08:05,947 --> 01:08:07,881
Just promise him.

936
01:08:07,963 --> 01:08:09,624
I promise.

937
01:08:26,907 --> 01:08:29,432
- Was that our plane?
- No, no.

938
01:08:29,499 --> 01:08:32,263
If it were our plane, it'd be crashing.

939
01:08:32,315 --> 01:08:34,408
Where is the airport?

940
01:08:35,675 --> 01:08:37,438
How far?

941
01:08:51,099 --> 01:08:53,761
There must be a lot of competition
for that corner.

942
01:08:53,819 --> 01:08:56,583
Man, thank God she's not
too symbolic or anything.

943
01:08:56,635 --> 01:08:58,899
What does it mean anyway, Grimm?

944
01:09:00,827 --> 01:09:02,624
I sure couldn't tell you.

945
01:09:02,715 --> 01:09:06,048
You know, Grimm.
It means "flowers for the dead."

946
01:09:07,771 --> 01:09:11,002
Oh, God!

947
01:09:11,035 --> 01:09:14,198
We're all gonna die!

948
01:09:16,155 --> 01:09:18,020
We're all gonna die!

949
01:09:18,331 --> 01:09:21,926
Give him a moment.
He's getting his second wind.

950
01:09:40,571 --> 01:09:45,031
Wait a minute. Phyllis can't ride
on that thing, not in her condition.

951
01:09:52,859 --> 01:09:54,684
Hold on to your transfer to reboard.

952
01:09:54,971 --> 01:09:57,003
Hold on to your transfer to reboard.

953
01:09:57,370 --> 01:09:59,736
Hold on to your transfer to reboard.

954
01:09:59,803 --> 01:10:03,034
Move right along.
Hold on to your transfer to reboard.

955
01:10:03,067 --> 01:10:06,559
- There you go. Move along.
- Chief, you'll wanna hear this one.

956
01:10:06,587 --> 01:10:09,420
- Why, you got something?
- Damn right, I do.

957
01:10:18,907 --> 01:10:21,398
We're going to the airport.
I'm taking your car.

958
01:10:21,467 --> 01:10:23,799
Need him to make an ID.

959
01:10:35,995 --> 01:10:39,590
- You mean you weren't even gonna tell me?
- I wanted to, Grimm.

960
01:10:39,610 --> 01:10:41,441
But when? Before the bank?

961
01:10:41,530 --> 01:10:43,327
Just to add some pressure?

962
01:10:43,419 --> 01:10:44,977
And what about after?

963
01:10:45,083 --> 01:10:47,950
I tried to tell you several times...

964
01:10:47,995 --> 01:10:50,259
...but you were too busy being complete.

965
01:10:50,330 --> 01:10:53,424
Grimm, I gotta get this money
off my body.

966
01:10:53,467 --> 01:10:58,336
We'll get you a duffel bag or something
after we get past the x-ray machines.

967
01:10:59,322 --> 01:11:00,755
How many months?

968
01:11:02,619 --> 01:11:04,587
Phyllis, please.

969
01:11:05,307 --> 01:11:07,207
- They haven't boarded yet.
- Let them.

970
01:11:07,291 --> 01:11:11,284
That means they'll pass the metal detectors.
They'll be trapped and unarmed.

971
01:11:11,290 --> 01:11:15,750
I'll make the arrest onboard, quietly and
alone, before they know what's happening.

972
01:11:15,785 --> 01:11:20,088
- It's my baby too!
- Jesus, this is a fairly young guy.

973
01:11:20,123 --> 01:11:23,957
I've got trained anti-terrorist squads
who are prepared to deal...

974
01:11:23,963 --> 01:11:26,523
...with this kind of thing.
- I want this.

975
01:11:26,587 --> 01:11:27,986
Frankly...

976
01:11:28,091 --> 01:11:30,685
...I need it, after today.

977
01:11:30,746 --> 01:11:32,577
- Thank you, Roy.
- Got it.

978
01:11:33,178 --> 01:11:35,373
Roy's gonna get us the duffel bag...

979
01:11:35,450 --> 01:11:38,817
...a wheelchair and skis out of lost luggage
to cover your limp.

980
01:11:38,843 --> 01:11:41,676
- You give him a couple of bucks?
- Try 12oo.

981
01:11:41,723 --> 01:11:44,851
Scary, but Roy's sixth sense told him
we were in a jam.

982
01:11:44,890 --> 01:11:47,120
ESP exists, Grimm. They proved it.

983
01:11:47,195 --> 01:11:51,029
You picking up anything from me right now?
I'm gonna get boarding passes.

984
01:11:51,035 --> 01:11:52,866
Am I gonna see you in there?

985
01:11:52,955 --> 01:11:55,389
I'll make sure the Amazing Kreskin
gets inside.

986
01:11:55,450 --> 01:11:56,917
Good.

987
01:11:58,427 --> 01:11:59,951
Now what?

988
01:12:02,938 --> 01:12:04,997
Hey, clown!

989
01:12:06,331 --> 01:12:08,799
Get the hell back in line.

990
01:12:08,859 --> 01:12:10,349
I just have one question.

991
01:12:11,162 --> 01:12:12,424
Is there a problem, sir?

992
01:12:13,051 --> 01:12:16,612
- Too many passengers, I'm afraid.
- Yeah, you'd better be afraid.

993
01:12:16,634 --> 01:12:18,659
Nobody does this to Russ Crane.

994
01:12:18,746 --> 01:12:23,342
Nobody does this to Mrs. Russ Crane,
you glorified stewardess, you!

995
01:12:23,377 --> 01:12:26,486
What's the matter with you,
you afraid to do a man's job?

996
01:12:26,522 --> 01:12:28,353
Right through there.

997
01:12:28,442 --> 01:12:29,966
- Name, please?
- Oh, thank you.

998
01:12:30,074 --> 01:12:31,666
Yes. Grimm.

999
01:13:03,547 --> 01:13:06,880
The cops are looking for two men
and a woman, so let's split up.

1000
01:13:06,906 --> 01:13:08,874
Okay. I'll say goodbye now.

1001
01:13:09,722 --> 01:13:12,714
- Are you crazy?
- I'm sorry. Do you think this is easy?

1002
01:13:12,762 --> 01:13:16,254
- What did I do tonight that you didn't?
- Turned into Jimmy Cagney.

1003
01:13:16,698 --> 01:13:21,374
That bank was just a springboard for you.
You know, you ripped off the Mob...

1004
01:13:21,409 --> 01:13:26,050
...you bribed Roy, you totally demoralized
that guy Edison, and he had the gun.

1005
01:13:26,085 --> 01:13:27,375
You stole that watch.

1006
01:13:27,483 --> 01:13:32,250
I bought it, and the Edisons will have
better sex than they've had since Altamont.

1007
01:13:33,211 --> 01:13:37,875
Whatever I did, I did it so that
we could all leave here together.

1008
01:13:37,910 --> 01:13:40,285
Do you think I should just
be a bumbling idiot?

1009
01:13:40,346 --> 01:13:43,747
I just think you're not gonna
be able to go back to what you were.

1010
01:13:43,771 --> 01:13:47,753
I'm not! I'm going to Martinique
with a million bucks taped to my butt...

1011
01:13:47,788 --> 01:13:51,735
...unless you keep screwing around,
in which case, we'll all go to jail.

1012
01:13:52,091 --> 01:13:55,390
- Grimm, I'm thinking of the baby!
- He'll be 3 when you get out.

1013
01:13:55,418 --> 01:13:59,149
Foster families are great, unless you
get a mercenary or religious nut.

1014
01:13:59,163 --> 01:14:02,564
He can visit you. You can show him
how to make license plates.

1015
01:14:02,586 --> 01:14:06,044
Thank God you're reaching out
to me with love and understanding...

1016
01:14:06,074 --> 01:14:08,304
...instead of just trying to scare me.

1017
01:14:08,602 --> 01:14:10,593
It's all I have time for.

1018
01:14:11,963 --> 01:14:15,831
Now, one of us has to take Loomis
and push him. Why don't you.

1019
01:14:15,835 --> 01:14:18,702
The men's room, Grimm.

1020
01:14:18,746 --> 01:14:21,237
I'll freak out if I don't get
this money off me.

1021
01:14:21,530 --> 01:14:23,430
Oh, shit.

1022
01:14:25,818 --> 01:14:29,049
Meet me on the plane
in two minutes, okay?

1023
01:14:31,290 --> 01:14:32,689
Please?

1024
01:14:46,042 --> 01:14:47,771
You were hard on her.

1025
01:14:47,866 --> 01:14:50,767
It was the only way to make sure
in the time allotted.

1026
01:14:50,811 --> 01:14:55,407
Maybe you should've told her you loved her.
Maybe that was the way to make sure.

1027
01:14:55,442 --> 01:14:57,513
Oh, Jesus, Loomis.

1028
01:14:57,595 --> 01:14:59,620
Now you tell me.

1029
01:15:07,162 --> 01:15:09,027
All right. Just once more.

1030
01:15:09,115 --> 01:15:10,776
- No.
- Please?

1031
01:15:11,802 --> 01:15:14,134
- Ready? I'll go real fast. Please?
- No.

1032
01:15:14,203 --> 01:15:16,137
Yeah. Come on. Now!

1033
01:15:21,818 --> 01:15:24,150
All right. Attaboy.

1034
01:15:24,219 --> 01:15:26,380
Now help me zip this up.

1035
01:15:26,714 --> 01:15:29,376
You people can keep this city!

1036
01:15:41,595 --> 01:15:43,859
- Hi.
- You think you're late enough?

1037
01:15:43,930 --> 01:15:46,296
Oh, you must be from around here.

1038
01:15:59,035 --> 01:16:01,970
We'll just go
and have a great time anyway, huh?

1039
01:16:02,011 --> 01:16:03,478
Right, Grimm.

1040
01:16:05,658 --> 01:16:07,956
Oh, this was not my idea.

1041
01:16:08,027 --> 01:16:10,018
This was not the plan.

1042
01:16:11,451 --> 01:16:13,442
I'm sorry, Grimm.

1043
01:16:24,347 --> 01:16:27,009
- Give me three minutes before you come in.
- Got it.

1044
01:16:27,067 --> 01:16:31,333
You go. Just promise me you'll see
a doctor as soon as you get there, okay?

1045
01:16:31,675 --> 01:16:35,042
No. We were all gonna go together.

1046
01:16:35,066 --> 01:16:39,662
Hey, you two with the mileage upgrades,
sit down.

1047
01:16:40,603 --> 01:16:43,037
You believe the filth they let into first?

1048
01:16:43,227 --> 01:16:44,558
Do you mind?

1049
01:16:45,594 --> 01:16:47,289
Come here, Loomis.

1050
01:16:47,387 --> 01:16:50,356
Look at you. I mean,
you have to get away, now.

1051
01:16:50,875 --> 01:16:52,740
<i>When I find Phyllis...</i>

1052
01:16:53,243 --> 01:16:56,838
- lf I find Phyllis...
- Yeah, I mind.

1053
01:16:56,858 --> 01:17:02,524
You goddamn straphangers are ruining
Mrs. Crane's beverage service!

1054
01:17:02,939 --> 01:17:04,497
You okay, baby?

1055
01:17:04,603 --> 01:17:07,572
Your bloody mary's not too spicy, is it?

1056
01:17:09,242 --> 01:17:10,800
That's my girl.

1057
01:17:13,338 --> 01:17:15,670
See you soon. Get a tan.

1058
01:17:15,738 --> 01:17:18,002
Moisturize before you peel.

1059
01:17:18,715 --> 01:17:20,615
Wait, Grimm.

1060
01:17:20,698 --> 01:17:22,825
We can find her together.

1061
01:17:25,146 --> 01:17:26,579
Oh, look.

1062
01:17:27,355 --> 01:17:28,413
<i>It's...</i>

1063
01:17:28,538 --> 01:17:32,497
I hate to do this to you, babe.
You'll never take me alive, Rotzinger.

1064
01:17:32,507 --> 01:17:35,271
- Save yourself the disgrace, Lombino.
- It's the king.

1065
01:17:35,323 --> 01:17:37,188
Vince, you fucking worm!

1066
01:17:37,274 --> 01:17:39,105
- He's come for the king.
- You snake!

1067
01:17:39,194 --> 01:17:42,527
Even if you get past me,
there are 5o cops waiting outside.

1068
01:17:46,747 --> 01:17:49,511
All right, Rotzinger. My turn!

1069
01:17:51,355 --> 01:17:52,845
Still got another minute.

1070
01:18:00,474 --> 01:18:04,342
<i>As we prepare for departure,
we ask that you pay close attention...</i>

1071
01:18:04,379 --> 01:18:07,837
You rat! You creep!

1072
01:18:07,867 --> 01:18:10,563
Can you hit him with something else?
Give me!

1073
01:18:14,747 --> 01:18:16,305
Thank God!

1074
01:18:19,002 --> 01:18:21,061
I did it with Mario, Vinnie.

1075
01:18:21,370 --> 01:18:25,431
When you were playing cards
with your stinking goombahs!

1076
01:18:25,946 --> 01:18:28,779
Nobody does that to Mrs. Russ Crane.

1077
01:18:29,274 --> 01:18:30,764
Quit making him angry!

1078
01:18:32,027 --> 01:18:36,361
It's thicker, Vinnie. It's thicker than
his neck and a lot more powerful.

1079
01:18:47,098 --> 01:18:48,531
Phyllis.

1080
01:18:56,186 --> 01:18:58,154
Phyllis, they just caught this guy.

1081
01:18:58,458 --> 01:19:01,552
Give me that goddamn...
All right.

1082
01:19:01,594 --> 01:19:04,688
Vince Lombino, a.k.a. Russ Crane...

1083
01:19:04,730 --> 01:19:08,427
...you're under arrest for murder
in first degree and second degree...

1084
01:19:08,442 --> 01:19:12,276
...arson, pandering, sale of weapons,
felonious assault...

1085
01:19:12,282 --> 01:19:14,876
...blackmail...
- Use of spouse as a shield.

1086
01:19:21,562 --> 01:19:23,689
Mario, how come you squealed,
tough guy?

1087
01:19:23,770 --> 01:19:25,965
Screw you.

1088
01:19:32,570 --> 01:19:34,094
That's him.

1089
01:19:39,354 --> 01:19:42,050
Don't matter what he's saying.
Throw him in the car.

1090
01:19:42,107 --> 01:19:44,632
- He's just along for the ride. Come on!
- Angie!

1091
01:19:44,698 --> 01:19:46,529
- Angel!
- Come on!

1092
01:19:46,618 --> 01:19:49,644
- Is Mrs. Lombino okay up there?
- Hey! Hey!

1093
01:19:49,690 --> 01:19:52,523
Angie! I love you, baby!

1094
01:19:52,570 --> 01:19:54,401
I love you!

1095
01:19:55,226 --> 01:19:57,660
I love you, Angie!

1096
01:19:57,722 --> 01:19:59,314
Hey, hold it, my friend.

1097
01:20:03,514 --> 01:20:05,038
Thanks for the assist.

1098
01:20:05,274 --> 01:20:08,732
- No problem.
- I'd like to give you a commendation.

1099
01:20:08,762 --> 01:20:10,354
What's your name and address?

1100
01:20:10,458 --> 01:20:11,686
Oh, that's great.

1101
01:20:12,186 --> 01:20:13,585
- Dan...
- Dan.

1102
01:20:13,690 --> 01:20:15,123
...Chipowski.

1103
01:20:15,355 --> 01:20:16,879
S-K-I...

1104
01:20:16,986 --> 01:20:18,214
...ending.

1105
01:20:18,331 --> 01:20:23,132
And it's 111 Astoria Boulevard,
Queens, New York...

1106
01:20:23,167 --> 01:20:26,556
...111 o1.

1107
01:20:27,866 --> 01:20:31,131
Okay, Dan. Wish there were
more like you.

1108
01:20:31,514 --> 01:20:33,482
Don't say that.

1109
01:20:33,947 --> 01:20:35,471
Come on, James.

1110
01:20:50,875 --> 01:20:52,570
Hey, it's Rotzinger!

1111
01:20:53,722 --> 01:20:57,317
- Are you running for mayor?
- Is this the greatest day in your career?

1112
01:20:57,339 --> 01:21:00,775
- Who the hell called these guys?
- I did, sir.

1113
01:21:04,794 --> 01:21:07,854
Hey, remember, we gotta
commend this "Cipowski."

1114
01:21:07,899 --> 01:21:10,231
I mean, Chipowski.

1115
01:24:50,362 --> 01:24:52,353
