1
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,500
You look like shit, man.

2
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:43,200
I'm all right.

3
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:48,000
Keep telling yourself that.

4
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:06,500
That right there?

5
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:09,400
That is the best homework assignment
the city ever came up with.

6
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:12,700
Yeah. Me and the kid start this weekend.

7
00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:17,000
That is, of course, unless Amanda botches
everything up, like she always does.

8
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:20,000
I could have Monica give her a call.
They always got along pretty well.

9
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:23,400
You know, Eddie, I appreciate it,
but it's best if you stay out of it.

10
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:26,500
Yo, D'Mac, what's up?

11
00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:30,300
Yeah, I'm interested. What do you got?

12
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:35,100
Haitians. Boyle Heights.

13
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,900
Yeah, I know the place.

14
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:42,500
3-B, got it.

15
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:44,900
Ya yo changing hands.

16
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
You really wanna mess with
this low-level shit?

17
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:48,100
Yeah, let's go.

18
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:23,000
- Are we good?
- All signs point to it.

19
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,200
Which one of you gentlemen
is gonna sign for this?

20
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:31,600
Nice suit.

21
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:38,400
I heard there was a problem with the toilet?

22
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:41,900
All right, fellas.
We got less than one hour. Let's go.

23
00:02:56,100 --> 00:02:57,500
Move.

24
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:16,700
- Police, freeze!
- Shit!

25
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:20,200
- Get him!
- On the floor, God damn it!

26
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:23,100
Stop!

27
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:30,900
Don't move!

28
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:47,800
- You got him?
- He got away.

29
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:50,800
- What?
- He got away!

30
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:54,400
Shit!

31
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,800
Not a word, Welles. Not a goddamn word!

32
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:00,700
Son of a bitch!

33
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:26,300
Now.

34
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:31,300
What the...

35
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:35,500
Chief. We got a problem with the elevators.

36
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:41,400
- Get down!
- And stay down!

37
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:48,000
Now that I have your attention,
get on the floor, right now!

38
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:49,400
- Take it easy, take it easy.
- Everyone!

39
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:50,700
- You, too, come on!
- Get down!

40
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:52,800
Everything's reading "Malfunction."

41
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,100
- The hell is this?
- I don't know.

42
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:56,700
We're not here to hurt you!

43
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:00,200
You stay calm, you go home for dinner,
you understand me?

44
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:04,900
Don't look at me.

45
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:17,000
Nobody move! And get down on the floor!

46
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:18,900
Shut up!

47
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:22,700
We got a naughty one here.

48
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:25,700
Jesus! FedCal, the bank.

49
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:28,900
All right, that's it, bad girl.
Now we get to go make a phone call.

50
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:33,300
Forty-five!

51
00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:39,400
<i>- News 14 hotline.
- Tell them there's a robbery in progress.</i>

52
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:42,100
I'm from the FedCal Bank, downtown LA.

53
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:43,500
There's a robbery in progress.

54
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:45,000
<i>- Are they still in the bank?
- They're still...</i>

55
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:46,100
<i>Are they...</i>

56
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:48,200
Come on, man, let's get out of here.

57
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:50,500
Let's go!

58
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:52,600
Jump!

59
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:53,800
Get down!

60
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:02,800
Hey, guys, a bank robbery.
We're headed downtown.

61
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:03,900
Let's go, now!

62
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:14,800
- I got the back!
- I'm on it!

63
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:16,500
They left the bank using the stairs!

64
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:18,300
All exits are covered.

65
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:52,700
Look, on the roof, a guard! Land it!

66
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:57,300
- We're not cleared for this.
- We're first on the scene. Land us, now.

67
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:04,400
Let's go!

68
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:06,800
Get the camera out.

69
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,300
Are you okay?

70
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:11,300
- No!
- Get on the ground!

71
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:14,100
Get on the ground!
Get out of the chopper now!

72
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:15,600
Take a seat next to your friends!

73
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:29,300
What a bunch of dummies! Good boy.

74
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:31,800
Nothing but glorified paparazzi!

75
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:41,600
Get us out of here!

76
00:07:58,900 --> 00:08:01,500
<i>There goes Channel 14 going the wrong way.</i>

77
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:03,900
That's why they're in last place.

78
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,100
Come on, Rivers, you're a free man.

79
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:31,300
You're out of here.

80
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,600
Any vacant floors?

81
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:52,600
Yeah, 26 is under construction.

82
00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:54,600
You got security cameras on that floor?

83
00:09:54,700 --> 00:09:55,800
Not in the construction area.

84
00:09:55,900 --> 00:09:57,300
Have forensics go over it.

85
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:59,300
You'll pick up prints
from half the damn city.

86
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:00,900
Do it anyway.

87
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:02,400
- You got it.
- Okay.

88
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:04,800
Went down pretty fast. We got a mixed crew.

89
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:07,200
Apparently, one of the guys
had some type of an accent.

90
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:09,100
- How much did they take?
- North of two million.

91
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:10,400
Some of the bills might be marked.

92
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:13,400
Who knows, maybe we'll get lucky.

93
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:52,000
So, they used C-4 to knock out the elevators.

94
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:54,100
Residue's being sent to the lab now.

95
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:57,500
Thanks. Automatic weapons,
precision timing.

96
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:01,800
Shape charges.
Degree of difficulty is off the charts.

97
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,300
They were hot shit, no doubt about that.

98
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:08,100
It'll make it that much sweeter
when we take them down.

99
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:09,100
Yeah.

100
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:25,400
What is it you want?

101
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:27,600
You Sergei?

102
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:30,400
Mikhail, from in the joint, sent me.

103
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:34,000
Okay.

104
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:41,200
Y'all having fun, huh?

105
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:43,300
Not so fast, my man.

106
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:44,900
Show me ID.

107
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:51,200
USA! USA! USA!

108
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:57,600
Think about it.

109
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:05,300
Cool down.

110
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:10,700
We... We have vodka
and take care of business, huh?

111
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:15,700
That's what I thought you'd say.

112
00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:18,600
We've got some serious stacks now.

113
00:12:18,900 --> 00:12:20,400
And I mean it's love, baby.

114
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:25,200
- Yeah, we did all right.
- All right, my ass.

115
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:31,100
Our biggest heist yet,
and you, you don't seem too jazzed.

116
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,400
No, I'm good.

117
00:12:33,900 --> 00:12:35,400
I'm good.

118
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:40,100
Listen, Dad called last night.

119
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:43,600
He wants us to come see him.

120
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:46,000
No. Hell, no, Jake.

121
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:49,400
I've been to see Dad in jail.
I've been to juvie.

122
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:52,900
I'm not going back. Not for you, not for Dad,

123
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:56,700
- not for anybody. Ever.
- Okay, okay.

124
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,700
He's got less than five.

125
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:01,600
So, when he gets out,

126
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:04,500
maybe we build him a house.

127
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:09,400
- Cool?
- Cool.

128
00:13:15,900 --> 00:13:18,100
Gordon says you find anything marked,
burn it.

129
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:25,000
Sounds tight.

130
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:28,100
You just gonna leave your kid bro up there
with all that paper?

131
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:30,600
If he runs out with it, shoot him.

132
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:32,300
I will, too.

133
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:35,200
Remember the song?

134
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:39,000
A'ight.

135
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:47,800
I don't know what to tell you.
We're so... We're so busy. Look at this.

136
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:52,500
And if we get that empty space next door,
think about how amazing it's gonna be.

137
00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:58,600
- What's this?
- Open it.

138
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:05,000
Oh, my God.

139
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:14,400
It's beautiful.

140
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:17,300
I think you're beautiful, too.

141
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:22,300
If you'll have me,

142
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:29,400
I wanna spend the rest of my life with you.

143
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,500
Cocky assholes.

144
00:15:45,700 --> 00:15:47,000
Tapes are ready.

145
00:15:47,700 --> 00:15:49,000
All right, let's see what we got.

146
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:50,200
There's 20 elevators for the lobby.

147
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:52,200
Twelve for the lower floors,
eight for the uppers.

148
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:54,000
You can cross over at 22.

149
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:56,300
So, over the course of the day,
how many people on and off?

150
00:15:56,700 --> 00:15:58,100
- Ten thousand, give or take.
- Shit.

151
00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:00,000
Well, let's see who got off
on the construction floor.

152
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:01,700
It couldn't have been more
than a handful of people.

153
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:04,500
Well, it doesn't work that way.
These tapes are time-coded, not floor-coded.

154
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:05,800
All these people getting on and off

155
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:08,600
and we have no idea
what floor we're watching?

156
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:10,200
Yeah. I mean, that's how it works.

157
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:12,800
Come on.
This is some system you got here, Chief.

158
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:14,700
Most of the buildings in the city
are set up this way.

159
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:16,900
- Whoever set it up is an idiot.
- Hey, I don't need this!

160
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,000
All right, I'm down here trying to help.

161
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:20,000
Hey. Look, man,
he doesn't mean nothing by it, all right?

162
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:21,600
- Thanks for coming by, okay?
- Screw you.

163
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:27,300
Meds not working
or we just need to get you laid?

164
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:29,400
- What's the problem?
- Look at this.

165
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:32,600
It's a camera.
They knew the elevator was empty.

166
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:34,900
They knew the building.
They knew the whole system.

167
00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:37,900
Yeah, must be a hundred hours here.

168
00:16:37,900 --> 00:16:39,600
We don't know
what the hell we're looking for.

169
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:44,700
Not to piss on Grand Cayman,

170
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:47,200
but I think I can get you an additional
75 basis points

171
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:49,200
in the Dutch Antilles. I say why not?

172
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:51,200
Yeah, but the way the markets
keep jumping around, man,

173
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:53,200
another four, six weeks,
who knows what the rates'll be?

174
00:16:53,300 --> 00:16:55,200
And have you seen
the latest Bloomberg report?

175
00:16:55,300 --> 00:16:58,300
- Shit is bleak out there.
- "Bloomberg reports"? Are you kidding me?

176
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:00,200
Come on, college guys.
Let's not over-think it.

177
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:02,300
Yeah, come on.
Dutch Antilles wanna pay us more money.

178
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:04,000
- That's a no-brainer.
- I like the Dutch Antilles,

179
00:17:04,100 --> 00:17:06,500
as long as the banks don't pack up
and take my money overnight.

180
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:09,000
Of course. 10% to the usual charities?

181
00:17:09,100 --> 00:17:10,700
- Absolutely.
- Cool by me.

182
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:13,500
I chartered a jet.
It's taking off Van Nuys Airport tonight.

183
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:17,400
Anybody wants to come,
I got your private parking passes right here.

184
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,000
It'll be sweet.

185
00:17:19,100 --> 00:17:21,800
Man, life's looking pretty good
from right here.

186
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:23,600
I'll let you know later.

187
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:51,300
Nice house. Cool view.

188
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:54,800
Great scotch.

189
00:17:56,500 --> 00:18:00,500
You know, jacking that news chopper
had "A.J." written all over it.

190
00:18:01,100 --> 00:18:02,700
How'd you get in my house?

191
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:05,500
Please.

192
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,700
They let you out early or what?

193
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:10,600
Good behavior. About a year early.

194
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:13,600
But I guess you guys kind of lost track, huh?

195
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:17,000
No contact. That's what we agreed upon.
So, what's up?

196
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:20,400
I think I'm gonna have another scotch.

197
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:24,600
It's good shit, John.
You gonna drink with me, right?

198
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:26,200
Sure you are.

199
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:27,800
You see, I came to you, John,

200
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:30,800
because you the one with that
higher consciousness and shit.

201
00:18:31,100 --> 00:18:33,900
- All right, I'm listening.
- Well, you asked what's up.

202
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:37,900
I miss my homies. That's what's up.

203
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:40,700
That, and some unfinished business.

204
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:43,400
Your money from '04 is safe
and accruing interest.

205
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:44,700
Gordon's got the bank account numbers.

206
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:47,800
What about Lilli? Who's got her numbers?

207
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:50,400
She's with Jake now.

208
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:00,200
Well, good for them.
I got a deal we need to discuss.

209
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:04,500
- A job.
- You're kidding me, right?

210
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:06,300
You're coming at me with a job right now?

211
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:08,100
Think I'd come at you on some bullshit?

212
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:11,900
Once in a lifetime, John. You know me.

213
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:13,800
I do my homework.

214
00:19:13,900 --> 00:19:15,300
All right, so what do you
want me to say here?

215
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:17,000
You ain't got to say shit.

216
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:20,900
Just remember I was the one left bleeding
on that fire escape in '04.

217
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:24,200
And they tried everything they could
to flip me.

218
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:27,500
I ain't budge, 'cause we had a deal.
I kept my end.

219
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:31,500
I kept this, too. You owe me, bro.

220
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:32,600
All of you.

221
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,200
What were you, boosting Camaros
back in Riverside

222
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:37,000
when me and Gordon decided to let you in?

223
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:39,300
So, don't be so quick to write me off.

224
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:47,300
All right, I'll talk to the boys
and I'll get back at you tomorrow.

225
00:19:48,700 --> 00:19:52,400
You do that. Love the place.

226
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,200
Alarm system sucks, though.

227
00:19:57,100 --> 00:19:58,700
There she is.

228
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,800
Hello. How's my baby G doing?

229
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:03,600
I'm good, I'm fine.

230
00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:05,700
- You look good.
- I feel good.

231
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:07,300
- Yeah? Yeah?
- Yeah.

232
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:10,300
They tell me maybe
you finish the program next week.

233
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:12,900
It's been a tough eight weeks.

234
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:15,800
Don't worry. I'm gonna do it this time.

235
00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:17,900
That's what my mind
and my body's telling me.

236
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,700
I'm with you. I'm with you.
You know that, right?

237
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:22,900
- Yeah?
- I'm not gonna need these anymore.

238
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,000
By the time I leave here,

239
00:20:24,100 --> 00:20:26,100
I'm gonna be cleaner
than the day I was born.

240
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:30,600
You know I'm grateful, don't you?

241
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:33,800
Stop it. You don't need to say that to me,
all right?

242
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:36,400
- Did you get my letter?
- Yeah, sure did.

243
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:42,000
I've been non-stop tripping over this,
I tell you.

244
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:44,700
- Caribbean, huh?
- Look at the water.

245
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:49,300
Clear and blue.
Cool and warm at the same time.

246
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:52,000
I've just got to get back there.

247
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,500
Soon as you're out of here,
I'm gonna take you there myself.

248
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:56,400
- I promise.
- All right.

249
00:20:58,900 --> 00:21:00,300
I love you.

250
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:35,900
Turn that off.

251
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,400
I know, so I walk into my house.

252
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:39,300
He's standing there,
he's drinking my whiskey.

253
00:22:39,700 --> 00:22:41,200
I was gonna shoot him
in the back of his head.

254
00:22:41,300 --> 00:22:42,300
Should've shot him.

255
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:45,000
The guy's been out 24 hours,
already wants to do a job.

256
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,300
- He's crazy.
- Or he's got huge balls.

257
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:49,500
Yeah, Ghost doesn't play
when it comes to money.

258
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:50,700
He's too smart for that.

259
00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:52,300
- The bastard's not that smart.
- That's for sure.

260
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:53,400
He's clever, not smart.

261
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:55,800
You guys, we always wait
at least a year between jobs.

262
00:22:55,900 --> 00:22:58,800
- There's a reason for that.
- Gordon, you guys go way back, right?

263
00:22:58,900 --> 00:23:00,100
Think he's being straight up?

264
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:02,000
Ghost could've ratted us out
a long time ago,

265
00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:04,300
but he didn't. Kept his word.

266
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:07,600
What's to stop him from doing exactly that
once we give him his cut from '04?

267
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:08,900
- See, that's the problem.
- Yeah.

268
00:23:08,900 --> 00:23:11,000
- That's a big problem there.
- Something ain't right.

269
00:23:11,100 --> 00:23:12,400
- I don't trust him.
- Relax.

270
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:14,600
- He's trouble.
- I think he's onto something, though.

271
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:18,800
- He says it's big.
- Do I look like I care what he says?

272
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:22,800
Well, whatever you decide to do,
I'm down with you.

273
00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:24,500
- All right.
- I'm going to the loft.

274
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:26,000
Private party!

275
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:28,500
- Where you going?
- None of your damn business!

276
00:23:30,100 --> 00:23:31,500
- Gentlemen.
- It's Lilli.

277
00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:34,900
- Baby, who ordered the Dom?
- That's for Johnny-boy.

278
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:37,100
It's the girl in the green at the bar.

279
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:41,700
She's cute.

280
00:23:42,100 --> 00:23:44,700
- Don't let her pay for it.
- No, no, she's gonna pay, man.

281
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:45,800
This is how it's done. Let me show you.

282
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:48,800
Slow down, lvy League.
This ain't the frat house, man.

283
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:52,300
Well, that's some funny shit, man.
That's some funny shit.

284
00:23:57,500 --> 00:23:58,700
I'll come back up later.

285
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:02,800
- Ghost.
- It's been a long time, girl.

286
00:24:03,300 --> 00:24:06,400
- When did you get out?
- Why? You miss me?

287
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:09,700
Ghost. You need to back up.

288
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:11,600
Easy, Jake. Easy.

289
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:16,300
I wish you guys the best. Really.
It's the past.

290
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:18,400
I'm here to discuss the future.

291
00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:20,000
If I may.

292
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:22,600
Told you tomorrow, Ghost.

293
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:25,500
I'm not here to bust any balls. Just business.

294
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,000
A'ight?

295
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,900
A.J. Any new tats?

296
00:24:30,700 --> 00:24:32,600
- Yeah, man, couple.
- Me, too.

297
00:24:34,100 --> 00:24:35,200
- G.
- Ghost.

298
00:24:35,300 --> 00:24:36,700
How's my man?

299
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:40,000
I'm doing good, mate.

300
00:24:48,700 --> 00:24:50,500
Lot of tension in the room, huh?

301
00:24:50,700 --> 00:24:52,200
What do you want, Ghost?

302
00:24:53,100 --> 00:24:54,200
Goddamn.

303
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:56,600
It's like that?

304
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,400
It's like that.

305
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:01,400
Well, I'll be brief.

306
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:07,400
Let's say we go Italian Job on that ass.

307
00:25:15,900 --> 00:25:18,100
Why don't we take this upstairs, Ghost?

308
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:19,600
Fair enough.

309
00:25:22,300 --> 00:25:25,500
Same plan as before, gentlemen.
25 to 30 mil.

310
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:29,400
All the cash we can carry.
Got to move fast, though.

311
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:30,800
When you say "fast," how fast?

312
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:32,700
Next Tuesday.

313
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:34,500
What?

314
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:38,400
Ghost, you want us to take down
an armored truck in five days?

315
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:40,700
I mean, it's not even worth talking about
unless you got the route,

316
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:42,000
and they change the route all the time.

317
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,400
- That's what screwed us last time.
- Yeah, man, you got the route?

318
00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:47,700
I got it. Exact one from next Tuesday.

319
00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:49,600
Any more questions?

320
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,100
- How'd you get it?
- In the joint.

321
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:54,100
I got in good with this Russian.

322
00:25:54,300 --> 00:25:57,100
Had the pleasure of keeping them guys
from Compton off his ass.

323
00:25:57,200 --> 00:26:00,100
In exchange, he had his comrades
on the outside

324
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:02,500
put the arm down on the dispatcher.

325
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:05,200
So the dispatcher do anything
to screw the job up,

326
00:26:05,900 --> 00:26:08,900
they're wiping out his whole family
back at the Ukraine.

327
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,300
Down to the sheepdog.

328
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:12,000
Why should we trust the Russians?

329
00:26:13,900 --> 00:26:15,500
They love their sheepdogs.

330
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:18,300
All bullshit aside,

331
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:22,800
I'm in for a quarter mil with the Russians
out my cut when the job's done.

332
00:26:23,300 --> 00:26:25,000
It's not your concern,

333
00:26:25,100 --> 00:26:27,700
so don't trust the Russians. Trust greed.

334
00:26:27,900 --> 00:26:30,100
- Why should we trust you?
- Well, shit, A.J.

335
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:34,100
I'm fresh out. I ain't in no hurry to go back.

336
00:26:34,100 --> 00:26:37,300
Besides, why would I screw over my guys?

337
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:40,100
Especially when
you're holding all my money, right?

338
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:42,000
Okay. What about the setup?

339
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:45,000
I mean, there's knowing the route,
and then there's the logistics, you know.

340
00:26:45,100 --> 00:26:48,200
Five days. Jake's right.
That's a real, real short fuse.

341
00:26:48,300 --> 00:26:50,400
That's where you come in.

342
00:26:50,500 --> 00:26:54,000
But I trust that when you and Jake
put your heads together, you'll figure it out.

343
00:26:54,500 --> 00:26:56,800
Either way, I need to know tonight.

344
00:26:57,100 --> 00:26:59,400
You ain't got the heart to pull it off, a'ight.

345
00:27:00,300 --> 00:27:03,000
We'll settle up on the money you owe me,
I'm sayonara.

346
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:10,300
Appreciate your time, gentlemen.
Thanks for the cigar.

347
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:17,600
- Hey, G, let me check out that route.
- Yeah.

348
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:21,400
This is not the way we do things, gentlemen.
It's too fast, it's too rushed.

349
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:23,800
It's a lot of money,
but this whole thing feels forced.

350
00:27:23,900 --> 00:27:26,400
Five days? Five?

351
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:29,500
Yeah, man, but, you know,
we can get the setup right.

352
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:30,700
Bet big, win big.

353
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:32,400
It's the only way to play.

354
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:36,400
We're takers, gents.
That's what we do for a living.

355
00:27:37,300 --> 00:27:38,300
We take.

356
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:39,800
It's a lot of money, Jake.

357
00:27:42,100 --> 00:27:44,200
- And that's what we're here for.
- You sure about this?

358
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:46,600
If it checks out.

359
00:27:52,100 --> 00:27:53,200
If it checks out, I'm in.

360
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,400
<i>- Yeah, what's up?
- Thought you'd wanna know,</i>

361
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:07,200
your Haitian buddy?

362
00:28:07,300 --> 00:28:09,700
His lawyerjust filed on you
for excessive force.

363
00:28:10,300 --> 00:28:12,000
All right. The guy was 6'5", he was resisting.

364
00:28:12,100 --> 00:28:13,300
What was I supposed to do?

365
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:15,000
Yeah, well, you must've hurt his feelings.

366
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:19,100
The bank. Hey, listen, what about the C-4
they used to blow the elevators?

367
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:22,300
Well, from the taggants, forensics traced it
to a mining company out of Nevada,

368
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:24,700
stolen about... About two months ago.

369
00:28:25,100 --> 00:28:26,500
All right. And what about the marked bills?

370
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:30,100
Bank finally sent over a list.
Max is gonna fax out a memo right now.

371
00:28:32,900 --> 00:28:34,000
Listen, man,

372
00:28:34,900 --> 00:28:38,200
<i>it's been a couple of weeks now.
You hear anDhing from Amanda?</i>

373
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:40,500
Listen, I appreciate it,
but I don't need any help.

374
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:44,000
We can work it out on our own. But thanks.

375
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:47,200
All right. I'll talk to you later.

376
00:28:56,100 --> 00:28:59,000
All right, so, for this route
Ghost is talking about.

377
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:02,400
The only place we stand a chance
is right there.

378
00:29:02,500 --> 00:29:04,000
- What's there?
- It's an old subway car turnaround.

379
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:06,600
It's large enough,
and it runs parallel to the street.

380
00:29:06,700 --> 00:29:09,300
It's kind of perfect.
I mean, we can get access on Hope Street,

381
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:11,900
but I say we hold them up
at Olive and Fourth.

382
00:29:12,700 --> 00:29:13,900
All right.

383
00:29:14,500 --> 00:29:16,400
And we need to get down there
first and get some intel on,

384
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:21,100
you know, street patterns, traffic density,
that sort of thing, but it looks good.

385
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:24,500
Once we determine the blast radius
and street density,

386
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:27,500
I can tell you how much C-4
you're gonna need to score.

387
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:28,800
What about the exits?

388
00:29:29,500 --> 00:29:31,000
Work in progress, G.

389
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,700
You know, we got to get down there first,
check it out.

390
00:29:34,100 --> 00:29:36,600
- Give me some exits.
- You got it.

391
00:29:36,700 --> 00:29:38,400
- It's good work.
- Cool.

392
00:29:38,700 --> 00:29:40,800
- All right, gang.
- Good to go.

393
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,400
Easy money, baby. Same as before.

394
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:45,800
All the cash is in the front truck.

395
00:29:45,900 --> 00:29:48,300
Second truck's totally empty. Just an escort.

396
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,200
Two men up front, two men in the back.

397
00:29:51,300 --> 00:29:53,900
Pump action 12-gauge
and.40 caliber Glocks.

398
00:29:54,300 --> 00:29:55,300
Maybe 9mm.

399
00:29:55,700 --> 00:29:58,000
They may have upgraded
their communication by now,

400
00:29:58,100 --> 00:29:59,700
but the same standard bulletproof windows.

401
00:30:02,900 --> 00:30:04,700
They ain't gonna know what hit them.

402
00:30:14,900 --> 00:30:17,900
Here we go. Must've taken up the tracks.

403
00:30:30,100 --> 00:30:31,100
That's it.

404
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:48,200
Yeah, he's still working it.

405
00:30:48,500 --> 00:30:50,700
Got brand-new wheels to show for it, too.

406
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:53,300
All right, let's go.

407
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,900
All right, wait for my go-ahead.

408
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:05,600
- Good morning, Franco. Nice wheels!
- What do you guys want?

409
00:31:05,700 --> 00:31:06,800
- Get up against the car.
- Turn around.

410
00:31:06,900 --> 00:31:08,800
Hey, hey, hey, hey, I'm clean, man.

411
00:31:08,900 --> 00:31:11,200
Hands off. All right?
Why don't you move your car?

412
00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:13,500
What do you know about some
C-4 boosted out of Nevada?

413
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:14,800
Nevada? I don't know nothing about that.

414
00:31:14,900 --> 00:31:17,200
Come on, if it's guns or explosives,
you heard something about it.

415
00:31:17,300 --> 00:31:19,700
You know, you get busted again,
you're facing 10 years minimum.

416
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:21,800
- You know that, right?
- I know this is a public place.

417
00:31:21,900 --> 00:31:24,400
I ain't done nothing.
So, why don't you move your car?

418
00:31:24,900 --> 00:31:26,400
- Do me a favor.
- Hey, Hatch.

419
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:28,100
- Look at this!
- What you got?

420
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:30,600
- What's that?
- Come on, Franco.

421
00:31:30,700 --> 00:31:32,600
- It's a damn shame.
- Looks like you caught a nail.

422
00:31:32,700 --> 00:31:34,300
- Yeah, you got a flat.
- Twice.

423
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:36,600
- Come on.
- You got a spare in the trunk, right?

424
00:31:36,700 --> 00:31:38,700
- Come on, I'll help you. Come on.
- You wanna check my trunk,

425
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:40,900
why don't you go get yourselves a warrant?

426
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:44,900
Hey, Dispatch, we got a disabled vehicle
on 9th and the 110.

427
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,300
How long would it take to get here?

428
00:31:47,300 --> 00:31:48,800
<i>Yeah, right around the corner.</i>

429
00:31:48,900 --> 00:31:50,000
You got one in the area.

430
00:31:50,100 --> 00:31:52,900
That's great. It's my lucky day.
I'll see you in a minute.

431
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,100
You guys must think I'm stupid
or something, right?

432
00:31:55,100 --> 00:31:57,500
- Bring it in!
- Man, what the hell is this?

433
00:31:57,600 --> 00:31:59,300
Come on! This has got to be illegal!

434
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:00,400
- No.
- Entrapment or some shit!

435
00:32:00,500 --> 00:32:02,200
This looks like a disabled vehicle to me.

436
00:32:02,300 --> 00:32:03,300
Hey, don't worry about it.

437
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:05,700
We'll do a full inventory,
including everything in the trunk.

438
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:09,200
Yeah, we wouldn't want you
accusing the LAPD of stealing anything.

439
00:32:09,300 --> 00:32:11,900
- Hey, come on, all right? Hey!
- Give us something, Franco.

440
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:15,000
- Give us something.
- This here is bullshit! Come on, man!

441
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:16,800
Come on, Franco, what do you wanna do?

442
00:32:16,900 --> 00:32:18,900
You know, you two guys,
you're a couple of...

443
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:20,400
- All right, hook it up!
- What are you doing?

444
00:32:20,500 --> 00:32:22,300
- Come on! Be nice, it's a new car!
- What are you doing?

445
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:24,800
Okay, okay, okay, all right!
I got something for you guys, all right?

446
00:32:24,900 --> 00:32:25,900
- Come here.
- What do you got?

447
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,300
There's... They got these guys,
they're trying to go upscale.

448
00:32:28,300 --> 00:32:29,500
- They're planning something big.
- What?

449
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:31,000
They're definitely planning
something real big.

450
00:32:31,100 --> 00:32:32,900
- Like what?
- I don't know like what.

451
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,000
But I know they're gonna use a C-4
on the job.

452
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:46,200
What's up?

453
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:47,600
'Sup.

454
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:08,800
You alone?

455
00:33:09,900 --> 00:33:11,900
Like I said on the phone.

456
00:33:13,100 --> 00:33:14,200
He's clean.

457
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:16,600
- No one.
- You Paulie?

458
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:18,900
Like the sign says.

459
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:22,100
So, you're the one who wants some C-4?

460
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:23,500
Like I said on the phone.

461
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:27,400
I know, the street's gone dry.
Someone bought up a big pile of it.

462
00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:28,600
That what brings you to me?

463
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:31,500
- Smart man.
- Yeah.

464
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:35,800
So, let me see your category one permit.

465
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:40,000
Permit? Thought this was
supposed to be simple.

466
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:43,300
It is. You got a permit.

467
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:47,800
My category one.

468
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:53,600
Yeah, it is simple.

469
00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:56,500
See, we take your money,
and you don't get shit.

470
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:29,600
Get over here!

471
00:34:39,100 --> 00:34:40,800
Hey, whoa! Hey. Come on.

472
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:45,700
Move, I put three holes in your head
like a bowling ball, big boy.

473
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:48,500
Should've kept it simple, huh?

474
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:51,500
- Thought you might need some backup.
- Backup?

475
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:53,200
Looked like you getting your ass kicked.

476
00:34:53,300 --> 00:34:55,900
Man, I told you guys to wait in the car.

477
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,400
- You had it under control, huh?
- Yeah, I did, actually.

478
00:34:58,600 --> 00:35:00,200
- Where's the C-4?
- It's in the shed.

479
00:35:00,300 --> 00:35:02,000
- Speak English! Where's the C-4?
- It's in the shed!

480
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:03,900
- Back in the shed!
- In the shed?

481
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,900
- It's in the shed?
- Back in the shed.

482
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,000
It's in the shed.

483
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:14,300
Nice job squeezing Franco.

484
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:17,100
Looking at 10 years,
funny how he gave up that address.

485
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:18,200
Think it's the FedCal guys?

486
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:21,200
Only so many people know
how to use C-4, Chief.

487
00:35:21,700 --> 00:35:23,500
- Duncan!
- Lieutenant Carver?

488
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:25,800
- Moving and grooving, Jack!
- I wanna speak to Detective Welles!

489
00:35:25,900 --> 00:35:27,300
I can't do this right now.

490
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:29,200
We're executing a search warrant.

491
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:30,900
Police work. Remember what that is?

492
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:32,300
Internal Affairs will have to wait.

493
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:34,800
Hey, you call me, Welles. Get back to me!

494
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:36,700
You don't want me to
have to come find you!

495
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:40,700
The hell is wrong with you,
coming down here now?

496
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:43,300
I wanna show you something.

497
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:01,400
Police, on the ground now!

498
00:36:03,700 --> 00:36:04,800
Go!

499
00:36:35,900 --> 00:36:37,600
Welles, I got nothing.

500
00:37:25,700 --> 00:37:28,000
Hatch, he's coming up on Spring!

501
00:37:30,500 --> 00:37:31,600
Shit!

502
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:43,700
Welles!

503
00:37:55,100 --> 00:37:57,600
- You all right?
- Yeah.

504
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:05,700
Our two dead guys,
Ethan and Constantine Symanski.

505
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:09,500
Brothers. Suspected Russian mob,
but they're no good for the FedCal job.

506
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:12,200
- Why's that?
- INS said they were being sworn in

507
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:14,200
as U.S. Citizens at the time of the robbery.

508
00:38:14,700 --> 00:38:16,800
- Couple patriots, huh?
- Yeah.

509
00:38:16,900 --> 00:38:19,000
They burned a bunch of stuff
before we got here.

510
00:38:19,700 --> 00:38:21,400
This is all that was left.

511
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:23,700
Looks like a map of LA.

512
00:38:24,300 --> 00:38:26,400
Yeah. Maybe.

513
00:38:27,900 --> 00:38:33,100
Look at this stuff.
C-4, automatic weapons, blasting caps.

514
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:36,900
They were definitely onto something big.

515
00:38:42,700 --> 00:38:48,400
Staples Center, Pershing Square,
Union Station.

516
00:38:50,700 --> 00:38:52,000
The hell were they up to?

517
00:39:07,100 --> 00:39:09,700
- We're good to go.
- Jake's all connected. You ready?

518
00:39:09,900 --> 00:39:11,000
All right, Jesse, we're up.

519
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:12,700
Show it to us.

520
00:39:21,900 --> 00:39:23,000
Nice.

521
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:25,000
All right, tell Jake to stop showing off.

522
00:39:25,100 --> 00:39:26,600
All right, man, turn it off.

523
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:28,400
- Good job.
- Good job.

524
00:39:30,900 --> 00:39:34,000
But the point is, I mean,
can we do it in three days?

525
00:39:34,900 --> 00:39:36,900
Not only can we do it,
but we're gonna play it safe.

526
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,200
All right, we're gonna drill at
about an inch an hour,

527
00:39:39,300 --> 00:39:41,300
16 holes in 64 hours.

528
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:43,900
Split the work, keep the schedule.

529
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,000
So, that leaves us one last day for prep?

530
00:39:46,100 --> 00:39:48,500
Exactly. Enough time for Jake and I to wire.
It's good.

531
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:51,600
All right, I'm gonna call Rahway
and see if we can get down there tonight.

532
00:39:55,700 --> 00:39:56,700
Who's there?

533
00:40:00,900 --> 00:40:02,300
G!

534
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:05,200
Naomi. What are you doing here?
You're supposed to be at the...

535
00:40:05,300 --> 00:40:07,100
I know, I know, I...

536
00:40:08,100 --> 00:40:09,700
- Catch up with you later, man.
- All right, man.

537
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:11,400
Wow, look at this place.

538
00:40:11,500 --> 00:40:12,700
What is this? Naomi?

539
00:40:13,100 --> 00:40:15,500
Look, I am really clean now. I feel great.

540
00:40:15,500 --> 00:40:16,500
Naomi, what are you talking about?

541
00:40:16,600 --> 00:40:19,000
Look, another week in that place
wouldn't have made any difference.

542
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,200
- We spoke about this, didn't we?
- Come on.

543
00:40:21,300 --> 00:40:22,500
I was doing really well.

544
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:25,200
I asked if I could leave early,
and they said yes.

545
00:40:25,300 --> 00:40:27,800
If you don't believe me, call them.

546
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:31,500
Look, they told us that when you get out,
you got to have a plan.

547
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:34,100
Yeah? Without a plan, you're dead.

548
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:38,100
So I started thinking about you and me,
our plan, and going home.

549
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:39,200
And that's gonna happen.

550
00:40:39,300 --> 00:40:42,400
You had one more week, that's all,
one more week.

551
00:40:43,300 --> 00:40:44,700
It's a busy time for me, Naomi.

552
00:40:46,700 --> 00:40:49,900
- You don't remember it, do you?
- No, I don't.

553
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:54,700
Look at how cute you were.
Mum was so beautiful.

554
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:59,000
I was truly happy back then.

555
00:40:59,900 --> 00:41:03,900
I'm not gonna be right until I get back there,
so I can start again.

556
00:41:03,900 --> 00:41:06,800
And we can. In just three days.

557
00:41:07,500 --> 00:41:09,400
I'm working. I need to put you in a hotel.

558
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:10,700
What? Why can't I stay here?

559
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:14,200
You can. It's just a bad time for me.

560
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:16,700
All right?

561
00:41:17,700 --> 00:41:18,800
Yeah.

562
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:23,700
Well, I can tell you it's not a street map.

563
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:25,800
It's some kind of a public works project.

564
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:29,000
But without a reference number,
there's no way I can work it out.

565
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:30,700
All right. Thanks.

566
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:32,000
You got it.

567
00:42:09,100 --> 00:42:10,700
Rivers, Delonte.

568
00:42:24,100 --> 00:42:25,300
Put your body in it.

569
00:42:27,600 --> 00:42:29,200
Right here, Eddie. Up with it.

570
00:42:30,600 --> 00:42:31,900
Yes! That's what I'm talking about.

571
00:42:32,600 --> 00:42:35,100
Hey, Eddie.
Take it easy on Uncle Jack, all right?

572
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:40,400
Time out. I did some work last night.
Wanted to talk to you.

573
00:42:40,500 --> 00:42:42,500
Hey, if you're gonna puke, do it on the grass.

574
00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:44,700
Come on, Dad, let us finish.

575
00:42:44,700 --> 00:42:46,200
Yeah, why don't you take my place?

576
00:42:46,300 --> 00:42:48,900
I'm good. Go ahead, keep playing, Eddie.

577
00:42:51,100 --> 00:42:53,900
- Eddie looks like he's doing a lot better.
- Yeah, he's doing great, man.

578
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:57,200
I mean, it's been about a month
since his last dialysis.

579
00:42:57,300 --> 00:43:00,800
Down for a couple days,
then he bounces back. I mean...

580
00:43:02,600 --> 00:43:04,200
- So, anyway, what's up?
- All right.

581
00:43:04,300 --> 00:43:07,200
You remember the jewelry job
in Koreatown, few years back?

582
00:43:07,400 --> 00:43:10,100
They used wires
and went from one building to the other?

583
00:43:10,200 --> 00:43:12,200
Guard got loose.
He ended up shooting one of them?

584
00:43:12,300 --> 00:43:14,300
Yeah. The guard ended up being
like a big hero.

585
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:16,100
The perp got shot on a fire escape, right?

586
00:43:16,200 --> 00:43:19,700
Name's Delonte Rivers, a.k.a. Ghost.

587
00:43:19,700 --> 00:43:21,900
He just finished serving five at Chino.

588
00:43:22,500 --> 00:43:26,200
And somehow, his prison ID ended up
at the Russians.

589
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:27,500
I saw it in the Polaroids.

590
00:43:27,600 --> 00:43:29,300
So, you think this guy's good
for the FedCal heist?

591
00:43:29,400 --> 00:43:32,800
I don't know. He was released the same day
the bank was hit.

592
00:43:33,100 --> 00:43:35,100
There's got to be some type of
connection there, right?

593
00:43:37,800 --> 00:43:39,600
Yeah, Max. What's up?

594
00:43:40,600 --> 00:43:42,600
- Morning, Jack.
- Hey, Monica.

595
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:45,900
Whoa, whoa, slow down.

596
00:43:46,700 --> 00:43:48,800
- Marketing rep.
- You got to be kidding me.

597
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:51,700
Look, Max, you can just tell Carver
he can call me Monday.

598
00:43:51,800 --> 00:43:53,200
I don't work weekends, okay?

599
00:43:56,900 --> 00:43:58,400
Internal Affairs.

600
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:00,900
Well, can I make you some breakfast, Jack?

601
00:44:00,900 --> 00:44:05,000
No, that's all right. I got to pick Sunday up.
We're gonna go look at some landmarks.

602
00:44:05,100 --> 00:44:07,900
- I'll see you Monday.
- See you, Jack.

603
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:11,200
So, what do we got?
What's the assignment for today?

604
00:44:11,300 --> 00:44:14,800
After we go to the Walk of Fame,
I'm supposed to write about us going there.

605
00:44:14,900 --> 00:44:19,300
Honey, the Walk of Fame's not a landmark,
it's a tourist trap.

606
00:44:20,300 --> 00:44:23,700
I got a better landmark.
Let's go over to La Brea Tar Pits,

607
00:44:23,800 --> 00:44:25,700
and then afterwards
we can go to the museum,

608
00:44:25,800 --> 00:44:26,800
we can look at the fossils.

609
00:44:26,900 --> 00:44:30,100
And then after that, we can go to
the Farmer's Market and get some burgers.

610
00:44:30,100 --> 00:44:33,600
Good idea.
Burgers and shakes at the Farmer's Market.

611
00:44:33,700 --> 00:44:35,200
Yeah, what do you got for me?

612
00:44:36,300 --> 00:44:39,000
Sweetheart, we're gonna have
to make a stop somewhere first.

613
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:46,800
When I got your message from last night,
I pulled Rivers' file,

614
00:44:46,900 --> 00:44:49,100
saw he was due this afternoon.

615
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:51,300
Cons like him,
they're good for a visit or two.

616
00:44:51,400 --> 00:44:54,000
But four years of lockdown,
I wouldn't bet on him.

617
00:44:54,700 --> 00:44:57,800
There's your boy now.
Want me to hold him? Rattle his cage?

618
00:44:58,100 --> 00:45:00,800
No. No, keep it routine.

619
00:45:01,700 --> 00:45:04,800
- You got an address on this guy?
- Some dump in Long Beach.

620
00:45:05,600 --> 00:45:06,900
Probably good for a week, if that.

621
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:08,500
All right, thanks.

622
00:45:12,500 --> 00:45:13,800
Little Tokyo. Let's go.

623
00:45:15,800 --> 00:45:17,600
Now are we going to the museum?

624
00:45:18,300 --> 00:45:20,400
Just a sec, honey. We will.

625
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:30,200
- Anything else?
- Give me a couple of these, too.

626
00:45:30,600 --> 00:45:32,000
Here, on the right.

627
00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:34,600
- Thanks, man.
- You got it.

628
00:45:57,300 --> 00:45:58,900
- What's up?
- You're late.

629
00:45:59,600 --> 00:46:01,600
- How'd the parole meeting go?
- We good.

630
00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:05,600
You know they try and turn pissing in a cup
into a seven-game series.

631
00:46:05,700 --> 00:46:06,700
We straight, though.

632
00:46:06,700 --> 00:46:08,200
- Can I help you?
- Relish.

633
00:46:13,500 --> 00:46:14,800
- Jesse.
- What's up?

634
00:46:14,900 --> 00:46:17,300
What's happening? Where the guys?

635
00:46:17,400 --> 00:46:19,300
I'm take-out. They're waiting on me.

636
00:46:19,400 --> 00:46:20,500
Sounds good.

637
00:46:21,500 --> 00:46:24,200
- So, did you get it?
- Come on, man. It's me.

638
00:46:25,400 --> 00:46:26,800
What are you looking at, Daddy?

639
00:46:27,800 --> 00:46:29,300
Just a second, honey.

640
00:46:29,600 --> 00:46:31,600
Same thing the rescue workers use.

641
00:46:31,700 --> 00:46:34,400
Easy as shit. Works just like a can opener.

642
00:46:34,500 --> 00:46:36,500
- Speak to the dispatcher?
- Yeah.

643
00:46:38,300 --> 00:46:41,600
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
I spoke to him this morning. We good.

644
00:46:42,700 --> 00:46:45,200
- Come on, man.
- Hey, the route's a lock, G.

645
00:46:47,800 --> 00:46:48,800
Talk to you later.

646
00:46:48,900 --> 00:46:51,200
Hey, man, find you something else
to worry about, G.

647
00:46:51,200 --> 00:46:52,900
I got you, homes.

648
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:58,000
What?

649
00:47:10,300 --> 00:47:11,600
Hold on to your seat, honey.

650
00:47:15,900 --> 00:47:17,200
What are you doing, idiot?

651
00:47:34,600 --> 00:47:37,300
You see a pen, baby? No?

652
00:47:48,600 --> 00:47:52,100
There, you see that blue sedan back there?
Two cars back?

653
00:47:54,300 --> 00:47:56,100
- Yeah.
- He's sharking us.

654
00:47:58,400 --> 00:47:59,500
Make a right.

655
00:48:01,500 --> 00:48:03,900
You have a pen, baby? Anything?

656
00:48:18,300 --> 00:48:20,300
All right, make another right.

657
00:48:29,800 --> 00:48:31,400
- He's staying with us.
- Yeah.

658
00:48:31,500 --> 00:48:32,700
Let's pull over.

659
00:48:35,800 --> 00:48:39,300
- Who are they?
- They're just some guys.

660
00:48:52,800 --> 00:48:55,000
- Is it a cop?
- With a kid?

661
00:49:00,600 --> 00:49:03,000
What's so important that you'd drag my ass
all the way down here?

662
00:49:03,100 --> 00:49:05,100
- I found him, Hatch.
- Who?

663
00:49:05,100 --> 00:49:08,800
Him, FedCal. Gordon Cozier.
I mean, look at that.

664
00:49:08,900 --> 00:49:10,600
Same height, same build, same everything.

665
00:49:10,700 --> 00:49:12,100
Wait, hold on. What are you talking about?

666
00:49:12,200 --> 00:49:14,300
- Where's all this coming from?
- I followed that guy, Rivers,

667
00:49:14,400 --> 00:49:15,600
from his parole meeting.

668
00:49:15,700 --> 00:49:17,800
- And he gets out of a cab downtown.
- With Sunday?

669
00:49:17,900 --> 00:49:19,800
What, are you gunning for
Father of the Year now?

670
00:49:19,900 --> 00:49:22,500
And from my car,
I see him go to this hot-dog stand.

671
00:49:22,600 --> 00:49:25,300
And Cozier's there.
Now, he's got his back to me.

672
00:49:25,400 --> 00:49:27,800
But I swear I see Rivers
pass something to him.

673
00:49:28,100 --> 00:49:32,400
A second later, this guy on a motorcycle,
he looks at Cozier.

674
00:49:33,200 --> 00:49:35,500
And then right before he takes off, bam,

675
00:49:35,900 --> 00:49:38,100
the same gesture
the asshole used in the bank.

676
00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:41,300
And then I followed Cozier
and got his license plate number.

677
00:49:41,400 --> 00:49:43,400
Yeah, it's very official. What is that, crayon?

678
00:49:43,500 --> 00:49:45,000
Look, man, I'm telling you, it's him.

679
00:49:45,100 --> 00:49:47,600
Except you can't see his face.
The guy's got a clean sheet.

680
00:49:47,700 --> 00:49:49,100
Come on, man, you follow an ex-con

681
00:49:49,200 --> 00:49:52,100
who's no good for the bank job to,
what, a hot-dog stand?

682
00:49:52,200 --> 00:49:53,300
- Then he meets somebody...
- Listen to me.

683
00:49:53,400 --> 00:49:54,700
Maybe he meets somebody there,
maybe he doesn't.

684
00:49:54,800 --> 00:49:57,400
- Maybe he passes something...
- Look, Hatch, I'm telling you I was there.

685
00:49:57,400 --> 00:49:58,500
...and buys a hot-dog
with ketchup and relish,

686
00:49:58,600 --> 00:50:00,400
- and then, some guy on a motorcycle says...
- Call me crazy.

687
00:50:00,500 --> 00:50:01,700
"So long," and rides off.

688
00:50:01,700 --> 00:50:04,100
Come on, man, give a brother a break.
Are you kidding me?

689
00:50:04,200 --> 00:50:06,900
Can we still go
to the Farmer's Market, Daddy?

690
00:50:07,700 --> 00:50:10,200
Baby, I'm sorry. Geez.

691
00:50:12,200 --> 00:50:15,300
I can't believe it's this late.
We can go eat somewhere else.

692
00:50:15,300 --> 00:50:18,800
Just gonna take a few minutes here.
Wherever you want.

693
00:50:21,800 --> 00:50:23,100
Shit.

694
00:50:24,300 --> 00:50:27,500
Your daddy loves you very much,
you know that, right?

695
00:50:28,600 --> 00:50:31,000
- Don't ever forget that, okay?
- Okay.

696
00:50:34,400 --> 00:50:36,600
Take care of the real stuff, Jack.

697
00:50:42,100 --> 00:50:43,300
Hey, how about some pizza, huh?

698
00:50:44,600 --> 00:50:46,000
I just wanna go home.

699
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:53,000
Let's go.

700
00:50:54,500 --> 00:50:55,500
Well, when'd it happen?

701
00:50:57,800 --> 00:51:00,600
No, no, no. It's all right.
If she comes back, do me a favor,

702
00:51:00,700 --> 00:51:02,900
you just keep her there, all right, Jimmy,
and you call me.

703
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:05,900
She doesn't leave the hotel.
Do you understand me?

704
00:51:06,300 --> 00:51:07,600
All right.

705
00:51:09,500 --> 00:51:10,500
Naomi?

706
00:51:10,900 --> 00:51:15,000
I left Jimmy some money at the hotel.
He didn't put it in the safe.

707
00:51:15,600 --> 00:51:19,100
- She took it?
- She's gone and so is the money. Shit!

708
00:51:21,900 --> 00:51:23,300
- What you doing, mate?
- I'm pulling over.

709
00:51:23,400 --> 00:51:25,900
- Why?
- 'Cause you got to find her.

710
00:51:27,200 --> 00:51:29,900
I'll take your time in the tunnel tonight.

711
00:51:39,100 --> 00:51:40,500
- Thanks.
- You got it.

712
00:52:32,900 --> 00:52:33,900
Damn it.

713
00:53:14,200 --> 00:53:16,600
- How's it hanging?
- Funny guy.

714
00:53:20,100 --> 00:53:22,100
All right, come on down.

715
00:53:22,400 --> 00:53:24,600
We'll go hot tomorrow morning.

716
00:53:25,800 --> 00:53:26,900
This is gonna be lovely.

717
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:36,200
Hey, G.

718
00:53:37,100 --> 00:53:38,500
We good?

719
00:53:38,600 --> 00:53:40,000
All signs point to it.

720
00:53:41,300 --> 00:53:43,800
- Any word from Naomi?
- No.

721
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:48,200
This time, I think she's gone.

722
00:53:48,600 --> 00:53:50,000
She'll turn up fine.

723
00:53:50,300 --> 00:53:52,100
What makes you so sure?

724
00:53:52,200 --> 00:53:54,500
If I had any family left, that's where I'd be.

725
00:54:00,800 --> 00:54:04,100
You know, if anything goes wrong
tomorrow, we can't let him walk away.

726
00:54:06,100 --> 00:54:07,700
He could still hang us for '04.

727
00:54:08,400 --> 00:54:09,800
I'll bring the insurance.

728
00:54:10,800 --> 00:54:12,500
There he is. How's it going, Ghost?

729
00:54:12,600 --> 00:54:14,200
I can't call it, gentlemen.

730
00:54:14,300 --> 00:54:15,900
- Yeah.
- What's happening?

731
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:17,500
- G. Cool.
- Yeah, man.

732
00:54:19,700 --> 00:54:24,000
Feels good to be back in action again.
It's like old times, huh?

733
00:54:27,200 --> 00:54:29,400
So, where we meeting at after the drop?

734
00:54:29,900 --> 00:54:32,300
Scott's giving me the information.
I'll let you know tomorrow.

735
00:54:36,300 --> 00:54:38,200
"Come sip from the cup of destruction."

736
00:54:39,200 --> 00:54:43,100
- Genghis Khan.
- Yeah. One of my heroes.

737
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:46,700
Saw what he wanted,
reached out and took it.

738
00:54:46,800 --> 00:54:48,700
Like us, tomorrow.

739
00:54:50,800 --> 00:54:52,200
Just like us.

740
00:54:56,100 --> 00:54:58,100
- To tomorrow.
- To tomorrow.

741
00:54:58,100 --> 00:54:59,500
To tomorrow.

742
00:55:10,600 --> 00:55:11,900
Yeah?

743
00:55:13,500 --> 00:55:18,800
Slow down, slow down. What?
Where are you?

744
00:55:21,500 --> 00:55:23,900
All right. Wait, no, no, I'm coming.
I'm coming.

745
00:55:43,500 --> 00:55:45,700
Where do I find Processing?

746
00:55:45,800 --> 00:55:47,900
Through the far door. Follow the yellow line.

747
00:55:54,600 --> 00:55:56,000
Where's Vice?

748
00:55:56,800 --> 00:55:58,700
Take the stairs to the basement.

749
00:56:00,500 --> 00:56:02,400
We got your fax last week
about the bank bills,

750
00:56:02,500 --> 00:56:05,000
so when we nailed this scum
with a bunch of fresh hundreds,

751
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:06,400
thought we'd call you.

752
00:56:06,600 --> 00:56:08,100
This low-life? You gotta be kidding me.

753
00:56:08,200 --> 00:56:10,700
He was hustling some stolen shit
with his girlfriend when we stopped him.

754
00:56:11,100 --> 00:56:13,800
None of the bills were marked, but we figure
they gotta be from some job.

755
00:56:13,900 --> 00:56:15,100
Did you question him?

756
00:56:15,200 --> 00:56:17,200
No. He didn't go easy.

757
00:56:18,100 --> 00:56:20,100
He's high as hell, too.
We decided to let him chill.

758
00:56:20,200 --> 00:56:23,600
All right. Let me talk to this guy.

759
00:56:27,900 --> 00:56:31,300
All right, I don't have time for this bullshit.
Where did you get the bills?

760
00:56:34,100 --> 00:56:35,600
I got him!

761
00:56:36,600 --> 00:56:39,100
I'm not gonna ask you again.
Where did you get the bills?

762
00:56:39,200 --> 00:56:41,600
- It was a loan, man, it was a loan!
- A loan. Bullshit!

763
00:56:44,100 --> 00:56:46,800
I want a name. Give me a name.

764
00:56:46,900 --> 00:56:48,900
- Naomi.
- Naomi what?

765
00:56:49,900 --> 00:56:55,000
- Naomi what? She got a last name?
- I don't know, man! I just met her.

766
00:56:55,100 --> 00:56:56,200
You bust her, too?

767
00:56:56,300 --> 00:56:59,000
Yeah, her name's Naomi Cozier.

768
00:56:59,300 --> 00:57:02,900
Cozier? Did you hear that, Hatch?

769
00:57:03,900 --> 00:57:05,000
Yeah.

770
00:57:06,100 --> 00:57:08,800
I ain't going back to no hotel
to sit on my own.

771
00:57:08,900 --> 00:57:10,500
Right, you ain't going back to the hotel,

772
00:57:10,600 --> 00:57:12,600
you ain't going
to the freaking Caribbean either.

773
00:57:12,600 --> 00:57:14,800
You're going back to the rehab
to start your program again.

774
00:57:14,900 --> 00:57:16,700
- Hell, no, I ain't!
- Yes, you are!

775
00:57:16,800 --> 00:57:19,500
I'm tired of them nurses and doctors
making you stand up

776
00:57:19,600 --> 00:57:21,000
and chat your business in front of strangers.

777
00:57:21,100 --> 00:57:26,200
Every time, you do the same thing!
Every time! Two days out of rehab!

778
00:57:26,200 --> 00:57:28,700
Just two days
and you're in the police station already.

779
00:57:28,800 --> 00:57:30,700
Where's the money I gave you?
Is it in your veins?

780
00:57:30,700 --> 00:57:32,500
You know, your problem is
you're too into my shit.

781
00:57:32,600 --> 00:57:34,800
Let me see your arm. Your shit.
You're not into your own shit!

782
00:57:34,900 --> 00:57:36,900
Why don't you get a life?
You don't care about me.

783
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:38,500
You wouldn't even let me stay
at your apartment.

784
00:57:38,600 --> 00:57:41,200
- That's right.
- You're ashamed of me. And I raised you!

785
00:57:41,300 --> 00:57:43,700
You raised me?
My crackhead sister raised me?

786
00:57:43,800 --> 00:57:46,100
- Can't even raise yourself.
- You ungrateful bastard!

787
00:57:46,100 --> 00:57:48,000
- Shut up.
- But you ain't worth shit, man.

788
00:57:48,100 --> 00:57:50,000
- I should've let Welfare take you!
- You're right, you're right.

789
00:57:50,100 --> 00:57:51,200
Wonder.

790
00:57:51,600 --> 00:57:53,000
Naomi!

791
00:57:55,100 --> 00:57:58,500
No! Naomi! Naomi!

792
00:58:07,300 --> 00:58:10,000
Gordon Cozier.
Signed for her 20 minutes ago.

793
00:58:11,900 --> 00:58:14,900
- Second time in two days.
- Yeah, I hear you.

794
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:19,200
Even if we tie those bills to a certain job,
it doesn't prove Cozier did anything.

795
00:58:19,300 --> 00:58:21,900
Question him now, he lawyers up,
splits town. We can blow this case.

796
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:24,500
If we can put him in the elevators
on the day of the heist,

797
00:58:24,600 --> 00:58:26,700
we'll have plenty to talk to him about.

798
00:58:36,200 --> 00:58:38,800
It's time. Let's go, Casanova.

799
00:58:40,400 --> 00:58:42,000
I'll see you tonight.

800
00:58:42,900 --> 00:58:44,500
You be careful.

801
00:58:45,900 --> 00:58:47,600
- I love you.
- Love you, too.

802
00:58:50,400 --> 00:58:52,700
Come on, lover boy! Let's go, mate!

803
00:58:56,900 --> 00:59:00,000
Got a job to do, baby. Come on.

804
00:59:06,800 --> 00:59:08,300
Let's go, let's go!

805
00:59:30,500 --> 00:59:32,600
You want a coffee? Donut? Anything?

806
00:59:32,700 --> 00:59:34,200
Naw. I'm okay.

807
00:59:35,600 --> 00:59:37,900
Hey, Jack. Carver wants to see you.

808
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:40,800
Not now, Max.
We're getting close on this FedCal job.

809
00:59:40,900 --> 00:59:42,800
It's not a request, Detective Welles.

810
00:59:46,600 --> 00:59:47,900
Orders, Jack.

811
00:59:49,900 --> 00:59:50,900
All right.

812
01:00:30,200 --> 01:00:31,800
This is chicken shit, Chief.

813
01:00:31,800 --> 01:00:35,100
The Haitian, the Russians.
I make judgment calls every day.

814
01:00:35,200 --> 01:00:37,300
- The union says I get an attorney...
- Before you go on about this,

815
01:00:37,300 --> 01:00:38,600
- you need to...
...just like the assholes

816
01:00:38,700 --> 01:00:40,000
- I gotta deal with out there.
- Jack, stop!

817
01:00:40,100 --> 01:00:44,200
Look, if you still want to see a lawyer
in five minutes, you can have one.

818
01:00:46,600 --> 01:00:48,000
Sit down.

819
01:00:53,700 --> 01:00:56,200
<i>Get down! Get on the ground!
Get on the ground! Spread your legs!</i>

820
01:00:56,300 --> 01:00:57,800
<i>- Keep your head down.
- The day you busted the Haitian,</i>

821
01:00:57,900 --> 01:01:00,700
Narcotics had surveillance set up
in the building across the street.

822
01:01:00,700 --> 01:01:02,600
<i>- Shut up! Stay down!
- I said they'd give you money!</i>

823
01:01:02,700 --> 01:01:04,400
<i>- What? What money?
- Money, right there!</i>

824
01:01:04,500 --> 01:01:08,800
<i>Stay there, don't move! All right.
All right, get out of here. Go.</i>

825
01:01:28,200 --> 01:01:32,000
Turn it off. All right, turn it off.

826
01:01:32,100 --> 01:01:33,700
I wanted you to know
who you were working with.

827
01:01:35,800 --> 01:01:37,000
Felt I owed you that much.

828
01:01:37,100 --> 01:01:40,300
Internal Affairs is bringing charges.
Papers are being drawn up today.

829
01:01:40,400 --> 01:01:42,300
You wanna drop Hatcher? I understand.

830
01:01:43,600 --> 01:01:47,100
No, no. No. No.

831
01:01:52,700 --> 01:01:54,100
How'd it go?

832
01:01:54,200 --> 01:01:56,400
You know, same old, same old.

833
01:01:56,500 --> 01:01:58,800
Shouldn't have roughed up that drug dealer,
you know?

834
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:01,100
- That's the beef? That's it?
- Yeah.

835
01:02:01,600 --> 01:02:03,000
Warning, short and sweet.

836
01:02:03,100 --> 01:02:08,000
Check it out. That's our guy. We got him.

837
01:02:08,600 --> 01:02:12,000
Time to turn up the heat on Mr. Cozier.
Let's go pay him a visit.

838
01:02:21,700 --> 01:02:24,500
All right, we're hot. Ready to rock, man.

839
01:02:24,600 --> 01:02:25,800
All right. Kill the traffic light.

840
01:02:35,200 --> 01:02:36,500
Let's go.

841
01:02:37,700 --> 01:02:39,500
Officer on duty.

842
01:02:39,600 --> 01:02:43,200
All right, Officer.
Package is due in five minutes.

843
01:02:44,900 --> 01:02:46,700
Crow's nest. Put an eye on him.

844
01:02:46,700 --> 01:02:47,800
Copy that.

845
01:02:56,500 --> 01:02:57,600
You're driving.

846
01:02:58,200 --> 01:02:59,900
Come on, let's go!

847
01:03:10,400 --> 01:03:12,500
Come on, man. What's wrong with you?

848
01:03:17,600 --> 01:03:19,200
Why'd you do it, Eddie?

849
01:03:23,200 --> 01:03:24,500
Why'd you take the money?

850
01:03:25,400 --> 01:03:27,400
What are you... What are you talking about?

851
01:03:30,100 --> 01:03:31,200
They got it on tape.

852
01:03:34,900 --> 01:03:36,300
Why'd you do it?

853
01:03:38,100 --> 01:03:39,300
Shit, man.

854
01:03:44,500 --> 01:03:50,200
Monica's laid off. We got a mortgage.
Insurance doesn't pay shit.

855
01:03:52,700 --> 01:03:53,900
All these medical bills.

856
01:03:55,800 --> 01:03:57,300
You gotta help me, Jack.

857
01:03:58,700 --> 01:04:03,100
It was right there.
It was right there, and I took it.

858
01:04:04,200 --> 01:04:05,600
Why didn't you come to me?

859
01:04:07,800 --> 01:04:09,200
I'm Eddie's godfather.

860
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:12,900
Come on. You're like my brother.

861
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:15,600
The kind of money I'm talking about,
you couldn't save it in a lifetime.

862
01:04:21,300 --> 01:04:24,600
Look, you've had my back
for the last six years.

863
01:04:24,600 --> 01:04:28,600
I'm gonna do whatever it takes to help you,
okay?

864
01:04:31,600 --> 01:04:32,700
Yeah.

865
01:04:45,600 --> 01:04:46,700
Package is late.

866
01:04:46,800 --> 01:04:51,000
Must've gotten hung up. They'll be here.
Goddamn! Get off my ass.

867
01:04:51,100 --> 01:04:53,600
This is not good. This is not good.

868
01:04:53,700 --> 01:04:56,800
Let me know, G. I'm ready.

869
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:02,300
Come on, boys, have some faith.

870
01:05:02,400 --> 01:05:04,200
I never trusted this guy.
This is bad, we gotta do something.

871
01:05:04,300 --> 01:05:05,300
This is LA, man. Nothing runs on time.

872
01:05:05,400 --> 01:05:08,200
Damn all that. We got a shitload of C-4,
and we're live down here. Come on.

873
01:05:08,300 --> 01:05:09,300
Just be cool, all right?

874
01:05:09,300 --> 01:05:11,400
Where the hell is it, Ghost?
Talk to me. Where is it?

875
01:05:11,500 --> 01:05:13,300
<i>They're coming, God damn it.
They'll be here.</i>

876
01:05:13,900 --> 01:05:15,100
Say the word, G. I'll send it.

877
01:05:15,200 --> 01:05:18,400
<i>Y'all need to relax. I told you they coming.
Damn!</i>

878
01:05:18,700 --> 01:05:20,300
G, we gotta make a move. Come on, man.

879
01:05:20,400 --> 01:05:21,400
All right!

880
01:05:23,400 --> 01:05:24,500
Where you at, John?

881
01:05:27,200 --> 01:05:28,900
I know you up there, son of a bitch.

882
01:05:30,700 --> 01:05:32,000
<i>Well? Is there anDhing?</i>

883
01:05:32,100 --> 01:05:34,900
Nada. If he bolts, this may be
our last shot, right now.

884
01:05:36,800 --> 01:05:38,700
<i>- G.
- Everybody, stay sharp.</i>

885
01:05:38,800 --> 01:05:41,500
<i>They'll be here, G.
Theyjust running a little behind.</i>

886
01:05:41,500 --> 01:05:43,200
We gotta do something. Come on.

887
01:05:43,700 --> 01:05:46,400
Come on, bitch. Where are you?

888
01:05:49,400 --> 01:05:50,500
Take him out.

889
01:05:58,700 --> 01:06:02,000
They're here! They're here, God damn it!
I told you they were coming!

890
01:06:02,100 --> 01:06:03,600
All right, hold up, hold up!

891
01:06:04,100 --> 01:06:05,200
<i>Buckle up, boys!</i>

892
01:06:06,500 --> 01:06:08,000
<i>They're turning down the ramp now.</i>

893
01:06:08,200 --> 01:06:09,700
Train's about to leave the station.

894
01:06:15,100 --> 01:06:17,200
<i>A'ight, G. Here they come.</i>

895
01:06:19,200 --> 01:06:21,300
<i>Merging onto 4th.</i>

896
01:06:29,600 --> 01:06:32,200
God damn it. You kidding me?

897
01:06:34,600 --> 01:06:35,900
What's the holdup?

898
01:06:38,400 --> 01:06:40,900
Come on, guys, I'm holding traffic.
Just give me the word.

899
01:06:40,900 --> 01:06:43,100
All right, boys, we've still got cars
inside the cones here.

900
01:06:43,500 --> 01:06:44,900
All right, keep me posted.

901
01:06:47,400 --> 01:06:48,400
Come on.

902
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:50,800
Come on, already! Yo, what's up?

903
01:06:51,700 --> 01:06:54,400
- Let's go!
- You gonna move this or what?

904
01:06:54,600 --> 01:06:57,100
Cones look clear to me. Holla at me.

905
01:06:57,200 --> 01:06:59,000
Go on ahead and wave them through,
Officer.

906
01:07:00,100 --> 01:07:01,300
Finally!

907
01:07:03,300 --> 01:07:04,800
Where you going?

908
01:07:10,800 --> 01:07:12,100
Showtime, boys!

909
01:07:12,200 --> 01:07:13,800
- All right, it's on.
- All right, here we go.

910
01:07:13,900 --> 01:07:15,900
<i>- It's on!
- It's in your hands now!</i>

911
01:07:17,400 --> 01:07:18,700
<i>Let's get paid, man!</i>

912
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:20,100
Fifty yards!

913
01:07:21,900 --> 01:07:23,900
Twenty-five yards! Ten yards!

914
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:25,800
<i>- Look out! Bike!
- Hit it!</i>

915
01:07:29,800 --> 01:07:32,300
Holy shit! Goddamn bicyclist!

916
01:07:33,800 --> 01:07:35,000
Shit!

917
01:07:35,700 --> 01:07:36,700
- Jesus Christ!
- You all right?

918
01:07:36,800 --> 01:07:37,900
Damn it, too soon!

919
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:39,200
<i>I still see the trucks!</i>

920
01:07:39,200 --> 01:07:40,900
We missed! Where is it?

921
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:42,400
- Truck stopped short.
- What's going on?

922
01:07:42,500 --> 01:07:44,400
- Shit!
- God damn it, Jake, you went too early.

923
01:07:44,500 --> 01:07:45,700
Shut up, Ghost, shut up!

924
01:07:45,800 --> 01:07:48,300
The street blew up! We're in trouble.
We gotta get out of here!

925
01:07:48,300 --> 01:07:50,300
Stay in that truck! We'll get you out of this!

926
01:07:50,300 --> 01:07:52,600
<i>- Get out and move that traffic, let's go!
- G, now what?</i>

927
01:07:52,700 --> 01:07:54,800
<i>- What we doing?
- Crow's nest! Where are you, crow's nest?</i>

928
01:07:54,900 --> 01:07:56,200
- Talk to me, talk to me!
- Jake, it's a bust, man.

929
01:07:56,300 --> 01:07:57,500
- We gotta get out of here!
- What are we doing, G?

930
01:07:57,600 --> 01:07:59,600
- I can't see shit!
- Follow procedure! Stay in that truck!

931
01:07:59,700 --> 01:08:01,500
- Okay, let's clear this!
- G, call it off!

932
01:08:01,500 --> 01:08:02,900
- No, no, hold on!
- What are y'all doing?

933
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:04,000
G!

934
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:08,700
Abort! Abort!

935
01:08:08,700 --> 01:08:10,600
All hell broke loose up here, man!

936
01:08:13,300 --> 01:08:14,400
G!

937
01:08:14,500 --> 01:08:16,900
Let's go, let's go!
We gotta abort this, we gotta abort this!

938
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:18,900
- Abort, abort!
- Hold on, hold on! I see something up here!

939
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:20,000
We got a man on the move.

940
01:08:20,100 --> 01:08:21,800
No, Officer, we're aborting this now!

941
01:08:21,800 --> 01:08:24,000
Not yet, God damn it, we got action!

942
01:08:24,100 --> 01:08:27,300
You don't see what I see, G!
Just keep them busy!

943
01:08:30,800 --> 01:08:32,700
What's this crazy son of a bitch doing?

944
01:08:37,300 --> 01:08:38,500
Hey!

945
01:08:39,900 --> 01:08:43,700
Shit! He just jacked a guard!

946
01:08:44,700 --> 01:08:46,100
Open this door!

947
01:08:46,200 --> 01:08:47,700
We got a vehicular, people!

948
01:08:47,800 --> 01:08:49,200
He in the truck!

949
01:08:51,500 --> 01:08:53,500
Crazy son of a bitch is going for it!

950
01:08:54,600 --> 01:08:55,800
He hit the car!

951
01:08:57,500 --> 01:08:59,200
Keep it clear down below, boys!

952
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:02,500
- Shit, man, here he come!
- Here he comes, here he comes!

953
01:09:07,100 --> 01:09:08,500
<i>He's ramming the truck!</i>

954
01:09:10,300 --> 01:09:12,400
<i>- Here it come!
- Get out of the way!</i>

955
01:09:16,400 --> 01:09:19,100
That's what I'm talking about! Damn!

956
01:09:19,200 --> 01:09:21,500
- Get the jaws, get the jaws!
- Keep them back!

957
01:09:24,500 --> 01:09:27,600
Shit! Little bastard!

958
01:09:28,300 --> 01:09:30,500
Soldier boy done lost his damn mind!

959
01:09:39,700 --> 01:09:42,100
Shit! What's he doing?

960
01:09:42,100 --> 01:09:43,700
Our man got a problem here.

961
01:09:46,200 --> 01:09:47,600
Hit the guard!

962
01:09:50,600 --> 01:09:52,000
Incoming!

963
01:09:56,200 --> 01:09:57,300
Hell, yeah.

964
01:09:58,000 --> 01:09:59,100
Take his shit!

965
01:10:02,700 --> 01:10:05,300
I've got you, man. Come on. Got you.

966
01:10:14,100 --> 01:10:15,100
We got it.

967
01:10:15,500 --> 01:10:18,600
<i>All units, 211 on an armored vehicle,
4th and Olive.</i>

968
01:10:18,700 --> 01:10:22,200
<i>Repeat, armored vehicle robbery
in progress, 4th and Olive.</i>

969
01:10:22,300 --> 01:10:24,100
4th and Olive. That's them.

970
01:10:26,100 --> 01:10:27,400
Turn the car around.

971
01:10:28,200 --> 01:10:29,800
I'm taking you home, Eddie.

972
01:10:30,900 --> 01:10:33,400
Come on, turn the car around.
It's a couple blocks away.

973
01:10:35,300 --> 01:10:38,000
- No, man.
- God damn it, man, I'm still a cop!

974
01:10:38,100 --> 01:10:39,200
Turn the car around!

975
01:10:41,300 --> 01:10:42,300
All right.

976
01:10:50,300 --> 01:10:51,800
Let's hustle, boys, come on!

977
01:10:52,500 --> 01:10:53,700
Yeah!

978
01:10:53,800 --> 01:10:55,800
- Come on!
- Come on, Jake!

979
01:10:55,900 --> 01:10:57,000
Go, go, go, go!

980
01:10:59,500 --> 01:11:01,300
Yeah, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go!

981
01:11:09,200 --> 01:11:10,300
Move it, move it!

982
01:11:25,300 --> 01:11:26,400
Look at this.

983
01:11:28,100 --> 01:11:29,900
Took a shitload of explosives to do this.

984
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:31,200
- C-4.
- Yeah.

985
01:11:31,300 --> 01:11:33,500
- What do you got?
- We got two down in the hole.

986
01:11:34,400 --> 01:11:35,800
Guard got a look at one of them.

987
01:11:35,900 --> 01:11:37,800
Caucasian male, adult, in his 30s.

988
01:11:37,900 --> 01:11:40,000
I got a sketch artist coming here now
to work with our witness.

989
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:41,500
Jesus Christ.

990
01:11:41,600 --> 01:11:44,700
They're long gone!
Sewer tunnels in every direction.

991
01:11:44,800 --> 01:11:45,800
Sewer tunnels?

992
01:11:46,700 --> 01:11:50,000
Remember that public works map
we found at the Russian safe house?

993
01:11:50,100 --> 01:11:55,300
The burnt fragment? The sewers, explosives.
High-powered weapons.

994
01:11:55,400 --> 01:11:56,800
So the job went down
without our two dead guys?

995
01:11:56,900 --> 01:11:59,700
Yeah, well, you remember the map?
There was a subway map at the Russians.

996
01:11:59,800 --> 01:12:01,400
Yeah, you think the sewers
connect to the subway station?

997
01:12:01,600 --> 01:12:03,000
Could be, let's check it out.

998
01:12:03,100 --> 01:12:05,600
- What was the closest station circled?
- Pershing Square.

999
01:12:32,200 --> 01:12:33,200
Pardon me.

1000
01:12:38,900 --> 01:12:41,800
That's him, Hatch! The guy with the gray hat!
From the hot-dog stand!

1001
01:12:41,900 --> 01:12:43,200
- Shit!
- Freeze!

1002
01:12:44,200 --> 01:12:45,700
- We have a runner!
- Stop!

1003
01:12:50,800 --> 01:12:51,900
Asshole!

1004
01:12:53,800 --> 01:12:55,100
Get out the way, get out the way!

1005
01:12:55,200 --> 01:12:56,200
Look out! Look out!

1006
01:12:57,800 --> 01:12:59,300
- Are you crazy?
- Shit!

1007
01:13:09,900 --> 01:13:13,300
You all right? Hey! Where you going, pal?

1008
01:13:14,500 --> 01:13:15,600
We're in pursuit!

1009
01:13:15,700 --> 01:13:17,200
Headed toward Pershing Square.

1010
01:13:25,900 --> 01:13:27,400
He's headed through the park!

1011
01:14:07,300 --> 01:14:08,700
Move. Move. Move.

1012
01:14:11,300 --> 01:14:13,000
Get off my car! Hey!

1013
01:14:25,300 --> 01:14:28,300
He just left Grand!
He's headed towards the library!

1014
01:14:46,900 --> 01:14:48,000
Yeah, man.

1015
01:14:52,300 --> 01:14:53,600
Shit!

1016
01:14:54,100 --> 01:14:55,800
Police! Freeze!

1017
01:15:23,500 --> 01:15:24,900
Move!

1018
01:15:26,800 --> 01:15:29,700
Move, move, move, move! Get out the way!

1019
01:15:32,700 --> 01:15:34,000
Police! Watch out!

1020
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:35,000
- Which way did he go?
- Back there.

1021
01:15:35,100 --> 01:15:36,100
- Can we exit this way?
- No.

1022
01:15:36,200 --> 01:15:38,300
- Get out of the way!
- Cover those doors!

1023
01:15:38,300 --> 01:15:40,100
- Move, move, move!
- He went that way.

1024
01:15:40,200 --> 01:15:41,900
- He went that way.
- Down the hall.

1025
01:15:45,900 --> 01:15:47,000
Hey!

1026
01:15:54,400 --> 01:15:55,400
Move it!

1027
01:15:56,600 --> 01:15:57,700
Hey, hey!

1028
01:16:11,900 --> 01:16:14,700
Get out of my way! Get out of my way!

1029
01:16:15,100 --> 01:16:16,100
Everybody, out!

1030
01:17:05,400 --> 01:17:06,600
Come on, Jesse.

1031
01:17:21,400 --> 01:17:28,000
Hatch?

1032
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:30,000
Hatch!

1033
01:17:32,400 --> 01:17:33,500
Shit!

1034
01:17:37,800 --> 01:17:42,300
Hold on, buddy. Just hold on. Jesus.

1035
01:17:42,400 --> 01:17:45,400
- The son of a bitch was fast.
- This is unit 14.

1036
01:17:45,500 --> 01:17:48,300
I got an officer down.
Sixth floor, Monroe building.

1037
01:17:48,400 --> 01:17:50,000
I need immediate assistance.

1038
01:17:54,600 --> 01:17:55,800
Freeze!

1039
01:18:09,400 --> 01:18:10,700
He's outside!

1040
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:21,700
Come on, come on.
Just keep breathing, buddy.

1041
01:18:21,800 --> 01:18:24,000
Keep breathing. Come on, stay with me.

1042
01:18:37,700 --> 01:18:40,600
I need that crash unit fast! Now!

1043
01:18:40,600 --> 01:18:42,400
Come on, buddy. Hang in there.

1044
01:18:55,200 --> 01:18:56,400
We lost him!

1045
01:18:57,000 --> 01:19:00,500
Line of duty, Jack. Line of duty.

1046
01:19:00,600 --> 01:19:02,500
Yeah, come on. Come on.
You just keep breathing.

1047
01:19:02,600 --> 01:19:04,800
You gotta make it, man. Come on.
Look at me, look at me.

1048
01:19:04,800 --> 01:19:10,200
My family, man. Monica.
You take care of Eddie.

1049
01:19:10,800 --> 01:19:12,600
I'm gonna take care of your family.
Don't worry about that.

1050
01:19:12,600 --> 01:19:15,000
They're gonna be taken care of.
You just keep breathing.

1051
01:19:15,100 --> 01:19:17,000
- Come on.
- Tell Monica I love her.

1052
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:19,800
- I will.
- Tell her I love her.

1053
01:19:19,900 --> 01:19:23,000
Come on, buddy. Hang in there.

1054
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:43,000
It's me.

1055
01:19:43,800 --> 01:19:49,000
I know who it is. I watch news.
You think I'm stupid, you punk bitch?

1056
01:19:49,100 --> 01:19:53,700
Hey, cool it, brother.
I sense a little too much hostility.

1057
01:19:53,800 --> 01:19:55,400
I was just trying to make everybody...

1058
01:19:55,500 --> 01:19:58,700
I give you dispatcher, and you do job
with somebody else!

1059
01:19:58,800 --> 01:20:00,400
Two of my men dead. I kill you!

1060
01:20:00,400 --> 01:20:03,900
You do not wanna kill me. If I'm dead,
how am I gonna get you half the money?

1061
01:20:05,200 --> 01:20:06,600
You do want the money, don't you?

1062
01:20:07,300 --> 01:20:10,400
<i>You listening now? Thought so.</i>

1063
01:20:11,700 --> 01:20:16,600
Hey, we meeting at the Roosevelt Hotel.
I'm gonna convince them to give you half.

1064
01:20:17,000 --> 01:20:19,000
<i>I'll call you later with the room number.</i>

1065
01:20:36,600 --> 01:20:40,300
We're all real sorry, Jack.
I just spoke with his wife.

1066
01:20:43,500 --> 01:20:47,000
What about the surveillance tape?
His family?

1067
01:20:47,100 --> 01:20:50,000
Forget the tape.
He was killed in the line of duty.

1068
01:20:50,100 --> 01:20:52,000
He'll get a cop's burial and full benefits.

1069
01:20:52,800 --> 01:20:54,500
Good. Thanks.

1070
01:20:58,100 --> 01:21:02,100
You were making headway
with FedCal Bank. Was it them?

1071
01:21:03,800 --> 01:21:05,800
I don't know.
Guy started running, we chased him.

1072
01:21:07,700 --> 01:21:10,700
Eddie got shot. I got nothing.

1073
01:21:15,500 --> 01:21:16,900
You okay, Jack?

1074
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:20,300
Yeah. I'm fine.

1075
01:21:33,600 --> 01:21:36,800
- Jake? You heard from Jesse?
- No, not yet.

1076
01:21:36,900 --> 01:21:40,100
$19.3 million, so far.
Easily the biggest lick yet, gentlemen.

1077
01:21:41,100 --> 01:21:42,600
<i>Witnesses report...</i>

1078
01:21:42,700 --> 01:21:44,700
I can feel it, man. Something's not right.

1079
01:21:46,100 --> 01:21:48,100
This is my fault, man.
I should've never brought him in.

1080
01:21:48,200 --> 01:21:50,000
- Hey, Ghost?
- Yes, sir?

1081
01:21:52,800 --> 01:21:53,900
Yeah.

1082
01:21:54,900 --> 01:21:57,000
That's the account card for the '04 job.

1083
01:21:59,400 --> 01:22:01,300
That's $250,000 for the Russians.

1084
01:22:02,300 --> 01:22:03,900
That puts us even now, Ghost.

1085
01:22:04,900 --> 01:22:06,400
Say what, Rahway?

1086
01:22:06,500 --> 01:22:08,200
You heard me. That puts us even.

1087
01:22:08,500 --> 01:22:12,800
Yeah, a'ight. My plan, your command.

1088
01:22:14,500 --> 01:22:15,900
I knew I could trust y'all.

1089
01:22:23,000 --> 01:22:24,200
Who is it?

1090
01:22:25,400 --> 01:22:28,200
It's him. Where you been? I been calling you!

1091
01:22:28,300 --> 01:22:30,100
- Police chased me.
- Police? Where?

1092
01:22:30,100 --> 01:22:32,300
You brought them here?
Jesse, you brought them here?

1093
01:22:32,400 --> 01:22:33,400
No. I shot one of them.

1094
01:22:33,500 --> 01:22:34,500
- What?
- What?

1095
01:22:34,600 --> 01:22:36,700
- Hold on! You shot a cop?
- I had to, man.

1096
01:22:36,800 --> 01:22:38,000
- Where the money?
- I stashed it.

1097
01:22:38,100 --> 01:22:39,900
- You left the money? Damn!
- Goddamn!

1098
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:42,800
Stashed it? Hold, hold on! Everyone,
hold on. What happened, Jesse? Talk to me.

1099
01:22:43,500 --> 01:22:45,300
At the subway station, there was two cops.

1100
01:22:46,900 --> 01:22:48,000
And they just started chasing me.

1101
01:22:48,100 --> 01:22:50,500
And they chased you
out the crowd because of what?

1102
01:22:50,500 --> 01:22:51,600
How, how the hell am I supposed to know?

1103
01:22:51,700 --> 01:22:53,600
- Why?
- Ghost. Hold on.

1104
01:22:53,700 --> 01:22:54,900
- Hold on! Hold on!
- No, man, let him tell me why!

1105
01:22:55,000 --> 01:22:56,700
- So, what happened? You shot because?
- I don't know!

1106
01:22:56,800 --> 01:22:58,200
- I had to. He had me...
- Why'd you shoot him?

1107
01:22:58,300 --> 01:22:59,500
'Cause you stupid.

1108
01:22:59,600 --> 01:23:01,800
I had no choice!
He had me. He had me cold, man.

1109
01:23:01,900 --> 01:23:05,500
But he never fired at me.
It was... It was kind of like...

1110
01:23:05,600 --> 01:23:06,800
Like what?

1111
01:23:07,200 --> 01:23:08,700
Like he wanted me to shoot him.

1112
01:23:09,600 --> 01:23:10,800
Stupid ass!

1113
01:23:11,700 --> 01:23:13,800
Shit! I'll beat the shit out of you.

1114
01:23:13,900 --> 01:23:15,300
- G! G! Wait!
- Let him go! Let him go!

1115
01:23:15,400 --> 01:23:16,400
Get off me! Yo, cool it.
Get your hands off me!

1116
01:23:16,500 --> 01:23:18,000
- Back off! Back off!
- You understand what you just did?

1117
01:23:18,100 --> 01:23:19,600
- It wasn't my fault!
- You don't shoot cops!

1118
01:23:19,700 --> 01:23:20,700
I'll deal with it! Let him go!

1119
01:23:20,800 --> 01:23:21,900
You deal with it then, Jake!

1120
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:24,700
That's a death sentence, young blood,
and I ain't going with you.

1121
01:23:24,700 --> 01:23:26,100
Nice one, Jesse.

1122
01:23:45,900 --> 01:23:47,200
Still taking passengers tonight?

1123
01:23:47,300 --> 01:23:49,200
Van Nuys Airport, 8:30.

1124
01:23:49,300 --> 01:23:53,300
Look, with everything that happened
today, nothing personal,

1125
01:23:53,400 --> 01:23:55,400
I'll take care of your finances
and then I'm out.

1126
01:23:56,400 --> 01:23:57,900
- Okay.
- Fair enough.

1127
01:24:01,500 --> 01:24:04,200
<i>I'm standing about a block away
from the Monroe office building</i>

1128
01:24:04,300 --> 01:24:05,900
<i>in downtown Los Angeles</i>

1129
01:24:05,900 --> 01:24:10,200
<i>where an LAPD detective
was shot and killed about an hour ago.</i>

1130
01:24:16,300 --> 01:24:17,500
Right on time.

1131
01:24:18,700 --> 01:24:20,000
<i>Witnesses describe...</i>

1132
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:23,200
So, Jesse, how'd it feel
losing that money, shooting that cop?

1133
01:24:23,300 --> 01:24:24,900
- Ghost. Easy.
- What?

1134
01:24:25,000 --> 01:24:26,500
<i>Now, we can't confirm,
at this hour, but the suspect...</i>

1135
01:24:26,600 --> 01:24:28,400
Ghost, we ain't gotta act
like we friends anymore, do we?

1136
01:24:28,500 --> 01:24:31,300
Hey, business is business. Money is money.

1137
01:24:31,300 --> 01:24:32,700
I never said we were friends.

1138
01:24:33,600 --> 01:24:35,900
- Now, me and Lilli, however.
- Come here! You wanna...

1139
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:38,900
Hey! Take it easy! Hey, Jake, Jake, Jake!

1140
01:24:38,900 --> 01:24:41,800
Hey, come on, take it easy!
He's not worth it, all right?

1141
01:24:42,800 --> 01:24:45,000
All right, let's get the fellas
and get out of here.

1142
01:24:57,400 --> 01:24:59,000
I'm here. Which room?

1143
01:24:59,100 --> 01:25:02,500
1116. A'ight.

1144
01:25:11,800 --> 01:25:15,000
<i>Hey, Welles, where you at? You got a 20?</i>

1145
01:25:16,700 --> 01:25:19,100
Come on, man, I know you're out there.
Pick up.

1146
01:25:20,200 --> 01:25:22,200
<i>We're worried about you. Where you...</i>

1147
01:25:25,600 --> 01:25:27,700
All right, fellas, we're good.
We're out of here.

1148
01:25:27,700 --> 01:25:30,500
So, here's the deal.
Anyone wants to fly with...

1149
01:25:30,600 --> 01:25:32,500
- Where's Ghost?
- In the bathroom.

1150
01:25:32,600 --> 01:25:33,600
Get Ghost for me.

1151
01:25:34,300 --> 01:25:36,600
Tonight, Scott, 8:30, Van Nuys Airport,
all right?

1152
01:25:36,700 --> 01:25:38,600
Plane's ready. Bring your passports,
your bags, and your guns.

1153
01:25:38,700 --> 01:25:40,100
Ghost? Hey!

1154
01:25:40,200 --> 01:25:42,100
If you need anything,
make sure you give us a call.

1155
01:25:42,200 --> 01:25:44,200
What's he doing, taking a shower?
What's going on in here?

1156
01:25:44,900 --> 01:25:47,000
- What was that?
- Shower's on.

1157
01:25:47,800 --> 01:25:49,000
Hey, he's gone!

1158
01:25:49,100 --> 01:25:50,900
- I told you! I told you!
- What?

1159
01:25:51,000 --> 01:25:52,000
- I don't know about this.
- Damn!

1160
01:25:52,100 --> 01:25:53,100
- What are you talking about?
- Where'd he go?

1161
01:25:53,200 --> 01:25:54,200
- I knew this was a bad idea!
- Damn it!

1162
01:25:54,300 --> 01:25:55,400
Let's get out of here, let's get out.

1163
01:25:55,800 --> 01:25:57,200
Oh, shit!

1164
01:26:24,600 --> 01:26:25,800
Take out the automatic!

1165
01:26:28,800 --> 01:26:30,000
Jesse!

1166
01:26:43,900 --> 01:26:45,600
Hey, Jake, you okay?

1167
01:26:47,700 --> 01:26:52,400
Get up, man, get up! Come on, buddy!
Come on, man, come on!

1168
01:26:52,900 --> 01:26:55,200
- Out the back!
- Jesse, Jake, let's go!

1169
01:27:00,700 --> 01:27:02,200
Come on, let's go!

1170
01:27:02,300 --> 01:27:04,600
Go. I'm coming.

1171
01:27:11,800 --> 01:27:13,000
Go!

1172
01:27:15,000 --> 01:27:16,300
Come on, come on!

1173
01:27:47,100 --> 01:27:51,000
Where's A. J? Where's A. J? Where's...

1174
01:28:01,300 --> 01:28:02,800
Down, get down!

1175
01:28:07,200 --> 01:28:10,400
- Shit! Who are these guys?
- Sounds like Russians!

1176
01:28:14,700 --> 01:28:16,300
Jake! Check the hallway.

1177
01:28:16,400 --> 01:28:18,100
Let's put these beds up, let's go!

1178
01:28:37,300 --> 01:28:38,800
We got a shotgun in the hallway!

1179
01:28:59,600 --> 01:29:01,200
Stay low, stay low!

1180
01:29:07,800 --> 01:29:10,900
Shit! I'm out of ammo! I'm out, I'm out!

1181
01:29:11,000 --> 01:29:12,500
Where's Jake?

1182
01:30:17,000 --> 01:30:21,300
We gotta go, fellas. We gotta go.

1183
01:30:40,200 --> 01:30:41,900
Ghost set us up against the Russians.

1184
01:30:41,900 --> 01:30:44,700
Son of a bitch, he must've sold them
on the same plan.

1185
01:30:44,700 --> 01:30:45,900
That's why they gave him the dispatcher

1186
01:30:45,900 --> 01:30:47,700
and that big hurry-up
was just to get us to do the job first.

1187
01:30:47,800 --> 01:30:50,000
- Yeah, and we bought it.
- Yeah, all of it.

1188
01:30:51,000 --> 01:30:52,700
Shit, the heat's gonna be coming down now.

1189
01:30:53,600 --> 01:30:55,800
I know. See you at the airport.

1190
01:31:11,300 --> 01:31:13,800
Lilli? Lilli?

1191
01:31:26,800 --> 01:31:32,200
Hold on, baby. Oh, God, baby, get up. Baby.

1192
01:31:35,200 --> 01:31:39,000
Oh, my God, baby, wake up. Oh, just...

1193
01:31:41,300 --> 01:31:42,900
Goddamn, the money's gone!

1194
01:31:43,000 --> 01:31:45,800
Jesse, help me! Help me!

1195
01:31:58,900 --> 01:32:02,200
Ghost. Ghost, I'm gonna kill you. Oh, God.

1196
01:32:06,400 --> 01:32:07,900
Jake, we got company.

1197
01:32:11,000 --> 01:32:14,400
Jake, we gotta go. We have to go.

1198
01:32:16,700 --> 01:32:20,900
Oh, God. Ghost.

1199
01:32:56,800 --> 01:33:00,500
<i>Los Angeles Police Department.
Exit the building slowly.</i>

1200
01:33:00,500 --> 01:33:02,500
<i>You have 20 seconds to come out.</i>

1201
01:33:15,500 --> 01:33:20,300
Look, Jake. I was wrong about Ghost.

1202
01:33:22,400 --> 01:33:23,800
I'm sorry, man.

1203
01:33:24,400 --> 01:33:25,900
It's not your fault.

1204
01:33:35,000 --> 01:33:37,200
Jesse, you ain't gotta be down with me
on this one.

1205
01:33:38,400 --> 01:33:40,500
You got your own life to think about, man.

1206
01:33:42,100 --> 01:33:44,300
I already told you. I'm never going back.

1207
01:33:45,600 --> 01:33:47,200
And this is my life.

1208
01:33:49,600 --> 01:33:51,300
My car's out back. Where's yours?

1209
01:33:53,300 --> 01:33:54,700
In front.

1210
01:33:57,100 --> 01:33:58,300
Let's take yours.

1211
01:33:59,100 --> 01:34:00,300
Thought you'd say that.

1212
01:34:02,100 --> 01:34:03,500
You ready, bro?

1213
01:34:06,900 --> 01:34:10,500
Just me and you, big brother. Let's go.

1214
01:35:49,600 --> 01:35:50,800
- Naomi.
- G!

1215
01:35:50,900 --> 01:35:52,600
- What are you doing? Come here.
- G!

1216
01:35:52,700 --> 01:35:54,500
What are you doing? Are you all right?

1217
01:35:55,000 --> 01:35:57,300
- They won't let me in your building.
- We've gotta go.

1218
01:35:57,400 --> 01:35:59,100
Come on, let's get in the car. All right.

1219
01:35:59,200 --> 01:36:00,700
- Just wanna go home.
- All right.

1220
01:36:47,800 --> 01:36:49,100
There you are.

1221
01:36:54,000 --> 01:36:55,800
- Talk to me.
- I'm almost to the airport.

1222
01:36:55,900 --> 01:36:56,900
Yeah, me, too.

1223
01:36:57,000 --> 01:36:58,800
Hey, I'm tripping.
Hear me out right quick, all right?

1224
01:36:58,900 --> 01:37:00,300
Yeah, what's up?

1225
01:37:00,300 --> 01:37:01,700
Ghost has had the jump on us
from the get-go, right?

1226
01:37:01,800 --> 01:37:03,600
So, why would he take us all out

1227
01:37:04,800 --> 01:37:06,800
and then only settle for the cash
from the '04 job?

1228
01:37:07,200 --> 01:37:09,600
- He wouldn't.
- Unless...

1229
01:37:09,600 --> 01:37:13,100
- Man, he plans on taking all the money.
- Shit, Scott. Scott has all the money.

1230
01:37:13,100 --> 01:37:15,100
Exactly. I'm on my way. I'm right behind you.

1231
01:37:20,400 --> 01:37:23,600
I know this is a little last-minute.
Have him meet me at the bank.

1232
01:37:27,000 --> 01:37:30,300
Come on, Scott, pick up. Scott, pick up.

1233
01:37:30,600 --> 01:37:32,000
Yeah, I'm coming in tonight.

1234
01:37:32,100 --> 01:37:34,700
You have to make yourself available
at 9:00 a.m. Tomorrow, all right?

1235
01:37:34,800 --> 01:37:36,200
Can you do that?

1236
01:37:36,300 --> 01:37:37,600
<i>You've reached Scott. I'm away from my cell.</i>

1237
01:37:37,700 --> 01:37:40,200
Oh, God. No, Scott, pick up. Damn it.

1238
01:37:43,400 --> 01:37:44,600
All right.

1239
01:37:47,100 --> 01:37:48,700
Okay. Let's get out of here.

1240
01:37:50,200 --> 01:37:54,800
It's been a long day.
Can you pour me a Scotch?

1241
01:38:16,300 --> 01:38:20,500
Yeah, where are you going? You just
had to have it all, didn't you, Ghost?

1242
01:38:20,600 --> 01:38:22,800
- I'm just taking what's mine!
- Oh, yeah?

1243
01:38:23,300 --> 01:38:24,800
I should've shot you on the street today.

1244
01:38:24,900 --> 01:38:27,400
Naw, you should've shot me five years ago
on that fire escape.

1245
01:38:27,500 --> 01:38:30,100
You got caught, Ghost! You got caught!

1246
01:38:30,500 --> 01:38:32,200
You knew the game
when you was playing it!

1247
01:38:32,300 --> 01:38:34,300
You left me back there to die like I was shit!

1248
01:38:34,400 --> 01:38:35,500
You ain't shit, Ghost!

1249
01:38:35,600 --> 01:38:37,100
I helped you put this crew together!

1250
01:38:37,100 --> 01:38:39,100
So what? Now you wanna take it apart?

1251
01:38:39,200 --> 01:38:42,400
Drop the weapon! Drop it! Police!
Put them down!

1252
01:38:43,400 --> 01:38:45,100
- Put them down!
- Stay out of this!

1253
01:38:45,200 --> 01:38:46,800
- Better listen to him, cop.
- It's between me and him.

1254
01:38:46,900 --> 01:38:49,100
If you interfere, I'm gonna kill you, too.

1255
01:38:49,200 --> 01:38:51,000
- Last time, drop them!
- Shit.

1256
01:39:03,600 --> 01:39:06,000
What you expect me to do, G? Huh?

1257
01:39:07,000 --> 01:39:11,100
You took my money. Took my bitch from me.

1258
01:39:11,200 --> 01:39:13,100
Just put me out the crew, huh?

1259
01:39:15,100 --> 01:39:18,200
What you thought I was gonna do?
Let that shit go?

1260
01:39:18,300 --> 01:39:19,400
You got caught!

1261
01:39:20,700 --> 01:39:24,000
Yeah. A'ight. I see now.

1262
01:39:25,000 --> 01:39:26,700
It's all business for you.

1263
01:39:27,900 --> 01:39:29,700
Well, this shit just got real personal.

1264
01:39:43,200 --> 01:39:45,600
- Should've waited for me, G.
- The shit went too fast.

1265
01:39:45,700 --> 01:39:47,000
Hold, hold it, hold it, hold it.

1266
01:39:47,100 --> 01:39:49,800
Don't move! Don't you move!

1267
01:40:02,100 --> 01:40:03,400
You're that cop with the little girl.

1268
01:40:05,400 --> 01:40:06,800
You should've stayed out of this.

1269
01:40:08,700 --> 01:40:10,900
- Let's get that money and get out of here.
- Yeah.

1270
01:40:44,000 --> 01:40:46,000
<i>Emergency dispatch.</i>

1271
01:40:46,100 --> 01:40:47,800
Yeah.

1272
01:40:47,900 --> 01:40:53,700
You got an officer down.
Van Nuys Airport, hangar 12.

1273
01:40:54,900 --> 01:40:58,400
I've been shot and I need help.

1274
01:40:59,200 --> 01:41:00,500
<i>Units en route.</i>

1275
01:41:02,700 --> 01:41:03,800
I want help.

1276
01:41:15,000 --> 01:41:17,600
G? Are we going home now?

1277
01:41:20,600 --> 01:41:25,200
Yeah, baby. We're going home.

1278
01:41:28,200 --> 01:41:29,400
Are we good, brother?

1279
01:41:32,000 --> 01:41:33,500
All signs point to it.
