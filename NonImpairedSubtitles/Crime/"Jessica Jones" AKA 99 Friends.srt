00:10:25,542 --> 00:10:28,002
I got her covered.

160
00:10:28,085 --> 00:10:30,672
I think I know a way
to get her off Kilgrave's hit list.

161
00:10:30,755 --> 00:10:32,965
[sighs] But it's gonna be painful.

162
00:10:34,717 --> 00:10:37,179
[woman] And we're live in three, two...

163
00:10:37,262 --> 00:10:40,390
Hi, I'm Trish Walker
and this is <i>Trish Talk.</i>

164
00:10:43,268 --> 00:10:46,646
During my last broadcast,
I made some...

165
00:10:46,729 --> 00:10:51,401
flippant and disrespectful comments
about a certain individual.

166
00:10:51,484 --> 00:10:53,945
I was out of line by belittling this man,

167
00:10:54,028 --> 00:10:58,616
and ignorant of my own limitations
in challenging him.

168
00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:03,538
He is a very fascinating
and powerful man,

169
00:11:03,621 --> 00:11:05,707
deserving of respect,
and to that end,

170
00:11:06,833 --> 00:11:10,295
if he's listening, and I think he is...

171
00:11:10,378 --> 00:11:12,172
I want to apologize.

172
00:11:13,256 --> 00:11:15,425
I hope he forgives me.

173
00:11:19,971 --> 00:11:21,013
[Trish shuddering]

174
00:11:21,097 --> 00:11:22,181
I need a shower.

175
00:11:22,265 --> 00:11:24,351
Saying the words doesn't make it true.

176
00:11:24,434 --> 00:11:26,853
Remember acting?
It's how you won that award.

177
00:11:26,936 --> 00:11:29,063
My mom blew half the jury
to get me that award.

178
00:11:29,146 --> 00:11:30,857
It might not have been about my acting.

179
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:32,692
Fine, but Kilgrave knows
you're afraid of him,

180
00:11:32,775 --> 00:11:34,569
and that's all he cares about.

181
00:11:34,652 --> 00:11:36,696
Men and power,
it's seriously a disease.

182
00:11:36,779 --> 00:11:39,115
I mean, superpowered man, but...

183
00:11:40,283 --> 00:11:42,660
-Jess?
-[camera clicking]

184
00:11:49,292 --> 00:11:50,585
Jess?

185
00:11:50,668 --> 00:11:52,962
Jess, are you okay?

186
00:11:53,045 --> 00:11:55,006
Yeah, I just thought I...

187
00:11:55,089 --> 00:11:56,924
saw someone I knew.

188
00:11:57,008 --> 00:11:59,719
Yeah, no Teen Choice Award for you.

189
00:11:59,802 --> 00:12:00,803
Talk.

190
00:12:01,679 --> 00:12:04,266
Kilgrave's been surveilling me.

191
00:12:04,349 --> 00:12:05,600
Taking pictures.

192
00:12:05,683 --> 00:12:07,310
-Why?
-I don't know.

193
00:12:07,394 --> 00:12:10,980
So he can record me imploding
as he tortures me?

194
00:12:11,814 --> 00:12:14,609
The spy could be anyone
or everyone.

195
00:12:14,692 --> 00:12:16,611
It's been going on for weeks.
I had no idea.

196
00:12:16,694 --> 00:12:18,946
Just breathe, okay?
[stammers]

197
00:12:19,030 --> 00:12:20,114
He isn't here now.

198
00:12:20,197 --> 00:12:22,367
Yeah, well, he's always here.

199
00:12:32,794 --> 00:12:35,505
[Jessica] <i>I don't need</i>
<i>reminders of what I did to Luke.</i>

200
00:12:38,508 --> 00:12:40,677
<i>Even if I had good intentions.</i>

201
00:12:41,761 --> 00:12:43,054
<i>Mostly.</i>

202
00:12:56,859 --> 00:12:59,070
Listen to me, Larry.
You are never gonna win this one.

203
00:12:59,153 --> 00:13:02,198
[Larry] <i>Oh, are you a legislator now?</i>
<i>Are you gonna rewrite the patent law?</i>

204
00:13:02,281 --> 00:13:04,701
I'm not going to have to.

205
00:13:04,784 --> 00:13:07,495
Do you have any idea
how much people love their pets?

206
00:13:07,579 --> 00:13:12,625
Your clients poisoned their pets,
abusing manufacturing loopholes in China.

207
00:13:12,709 --> 00:13:14,586
You know who people hate
more than litigators?

208
00:13:14,669 --> 00:13:16,421
Puppy killers.

209
00:13:16,504 --> 00:13:17,797
<i>We can come in at half.</i>

210
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:19,424
She won't wait.
She wouldn't listen.

211
00:13:19,507 --> 00:13:21,217
I couldn't hear you over that print.

212
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:23,386
Larry, let me call you back.

213
00:13:23,470 --> 00:13:26,055
That was a potential
$50 million settlement.

214
00:13:26,138 --> 00:13:27,974
-Now I have to ramp him back up.
-Oops!

215
00:13:28,057 --> 00:13:30,435
I need to know if your firm
represents Audrey Eastman.

216
00:13:30,518 --> 00:13:32,311
She says she's with Desmond Tobey.

217
00:13:32,395 --> 00:13:34,356
Well, then you should be
invading Tobey's office.

218
00:13:34,439 --> 00:13:38,067
I did. Are "attorney-client privilege"
the only words that he knows?

219
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:39,652
He wouldn't even tell me
if he referred her to me.

220
00:13:39,736 --> 00:13:41,320
What's going on?
You're on edge.

221
00:13:41,404 --> 00:13:45,074
The last people referred to me
wound up dead in my elevator.

222
00:13:45,157 --> 00:13:46,951
If Audrey Eastman follows the same path,

223
00:13:47,034 --> 00:13:48,661
she won't be able to pay her legal bills.

224
00:13:49,328 --> 00:13:51,288
She is a client, I'll confirm that.

225
00:13:51,373 --> 00:13:54,417
-And do you trust him? Tobey?
-He's a partner.

226
00:13:54,501 --> 00:13:55,877
That's not an answer.

227
00:13:56,544 --> 00:13:58,796
He's handling my own divorce,
so yes, I trust him.

228
00:13:58,880 --> 00:13:59,964
Okay, good,
that's all I need to know.

229
00:14:00,047 --> 00:14:01,298
You need to pull yourself together.

230
00:14:01,383 --> 00:14:04,093
You are coming across
distinctly paranoid.

231
00:14:05,387 --> 00:14:08,431
[Jessica] Everyone keeps saying that.
It's like a conspiracy.

232
00:14:09,223 --> 00:14:10,517

-[Trish] <i>What if the apology didn't work?</i>
-Then I'll deal with it.

235
00:14:15,187 --> 00:14:17,690
Look, I'm with a client right now.
Sort of.

236
00:14:17,774 --> 00:14:21,235
How can you trust any client after
what happened with Hope's parents?

237
00:14:21,318 --> 00:14:24,321
[Jessica] I don't, which is why I've been
following her since dawn.

238
00:14:24,406 --> 00:14:25,907
<i>Following who?</i>

239
00:14:26,866 --> 00:14:28,785
[sighs] A jealous wife.

240
00:14:28,868 --> 00:14:31,871
Jess, come on,
I need the distraction.

241
00:14:31,954 --> 00:14:33,581
[Jessica] Fine.

242
00:14:33,665 --> 00:14:35,207
A jewelry designer.

243
00:14:35,291 --> 00:14:36,626
Audrey Eastman.

244
00:14:36,709 --> 00:14:38,252
Overpriced, chunky enamel stuff?

245
00:14:38,335 --> 00:14:41,338
Well, if she is mind-controlled,
that would explain some of her jewelry.

246
00:14:41,423 --> 00:14:42,632
It's not like she needs the money.

247
00:14:42,715 --> 00:14:44,509
Her parents died and left her a fortune,

248
00:14:44,592 --> 00:14:45,760
but all she does is work.

249
00:14:45,843 --> 00:14:48,888
Cheating husband...
She's compartmentalizing.

do the job and take pictures of the

<i>-Who you looking for?</i>
-Myself.

Kilgrave's got somebody tailing me,
feeding him pictures.

267

Police footage will show
who's around me.

I didn't forget proposing, no.

Well, that's worse for you than for me

315
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:46,435
Yet there's no gun to your head.
I don't like being summoned.

316
00:19:46,518 --> 00:19:48,688
<i>Quelle surprise.</i>
I have a job for you.

317
00:19:48,771 --> 00:19:49,814
Who are all these people?

318
00:19:49,897 --> 00:19:51,774
They claim they were
mind-controlled by Kilgrave.

319
00:19:51,858 --> 00:19:53,776
You should have seen
the ones we turned away.

320
00:19:53,860 --> 00:19:55,611
Maybe some of them are legit.

321
00:19:55,695 --> 00:19:57,113
Oh, please.

322
00:19:57,196 --> 00:20:00,825
That <i>Trish Talk</i> interview turned him
into the most popular alibi in the city.

323
00:20:00,908 --> 00:20:04,746
You bought Dr. Kurata's kidney story,
why not at least talk to them?

324
00:20:04,829 --> 00:20:06,706
Because I don't have time for this
right now.

325
00:20:06,789 --> 00:20:08,624
Because I have bigger problems, okay?

326
00:20:08,708 --> 00:20:13,545
Wendy has decided to make
this divorce very difficult for me,

327
00:20:13,629 --> 00:20:16,799
-and I need dirt on her.
-That's why you called me?

328
00:20:16,883 --> 00:20:19,093
I have a gun-toting client,
a spy to find--

329
00:20:19,176 --> 00:20:20,762
You owe me a favor.

330
00:20:22,096 --> 00:20:23,180
[scoffs]

331
00:20:24,223 --> 00:20:26,225
You were married to her.
You already have her dirt.

332
00:20:26,308 --> 00:20:27,434
She didn't know mine.

333
00:20:27,518 --> 00:20:30,021
Well, you're sneaky.
That doesn't mean she is.

334
00:20:30,104 --> 00:20:31,647
I didn't say it would be easy.

335
00:20:33,607 --> 00:20:34,776
[Hogarth whispers] God.

336
00:20:34,859 --> 00:20:36,736
Fine. Later.

337
00:20:37,694 --> 00:20:38,946
Who's first?

338
00:20:40,197 --> 00:20:41,741
Start at the beginning.

339
00:20:41,824 --> 00:20:45,661
I went into 7-Eleven for a bag of Doritos,
you know?

340
00:20:45,745 --> 00:20:50,875
And then this Chinese dude comes in,
and his eyes were all red and glowing,

341
00:20:50,958 --> 00:20:52,835
and I was like, "Dude."

342
00:20:52,919 --> 00:20:56,881
My Lucy is a nice girl. A virgin.

343
00:20:56,964 --> 00:21:00,384
Tell them. Go ahead.

344
00:21:00,467 --> 00:21:02,929
Kilgrave made me do it.

345
00:21:03,012 --> 00:21:04,305
He's our gardener.

346
00:21:04,388 --> 00:21:07,349
He landed on Jones Beach.
I thought it was a meteor.

347
00:21:07,433 --> 00:21:11,562
But then a man
came out of the waves...

348
00:21:13,105 --> 00:21:15,732
He lived with me for two days.

349
00:21:17,318 --> 00:21:20,654
He made me play my cello for him...

350
00:21:20,737 --> 00:21:22,323
until I made a mistake.

351
00:21:22,406 --> 00:21:23,991
[man] He didn't even talk, man.

352
00:21:24,075 --> 00:21:28,745
He just, like, stared at me
with his freaky glowing eyes.

353
00:21:28,830 --> 00:21:32,666
I was like, "This dude is making
me wanna jack this place."

354
00:21:32,749 --> 00:21:34,335
I pulled out my gun...

355
00:21:34,418 --> 00:21:38,005
I couldn't stop smiling.
He wouldn't let me.

356
00:21:38,089 --> 00:21:41,008
He said, "You want me bad."

357
00:21:41,092 --> 00:21:43,719
And then I did want him... bad.

358
00:21:43,803 --> 00:21:47,348
And not just Lucy.
All the girls in the neighborhood.

359
00:21:47,431 --> 00:21:49,809
When he speaks,
they spread their legs.

360
00:21:49,892 --> 00:21:51,060
Evil man.

361
00:21:51,143 --> 00:21:54,188
He gave me a purple staff

362
00:21:54,271 --> 00:21:56,357
and made me slide it up my--

363
00:21:58,150 --> 00:21:59,276
He had dreads.

364
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:00,361
Bald.

365
00:22:00,444 --> 00:22:01,653
Dark hair.

366
00:22:01,737 --> 00:22:03,489
He wore a white dress shirt...

367
00:22:03,572 --> 00:22:05,782
-Intense eyes.
-...and a tie.

368
00:22:05,867 --> 00:22:08,369
A red T-shirt...

369
00:22:08,452 --> 00:22:09,536
I think.

370
00:22:09,620 --> 00:22:12,915
He never wears a shirt.
He's hot.

371
00:22:12,999 --> 00:22:16,752
I was waiting for the L train.

372
00:22:16,836 --> 00:22:22,674
And he said, uh, "Nice jacket.
You wanna give it to me, right?"

373
00:22:22,758 --> 00:22:25,594
And I said, "Yeah."

374
00:22:25,677 --> 00:22:27,346
And...

375
00:22:27,429 --> 00:22:30,975
like an asshole, I handed it over.

376
00:22:31,058 --> 00:22:35,229
Now, I know it's not the same
as killing my parents, but...

377
00:22:36,981 --> 00:22:38,857
it was Zegna.

378
00:22:38,941 --> 00:22:42,069
-That limey cocksucker owes me five grand.
-Limey?

379
00:22:42,153 --> 00:22:44,488
Yeah, he had an accent.
He's British.

380
00:22:44,571 --> 00:22:46,240
-Get up.
-I'm telling the truth.

381
00:22:46,323 --> 00:22:48,534
Get up.

382
00:22:57,459 --> 00:22:58,794
[shuddering]

383
00:23:00,922 --> 00:23:02,381
Put him on the list.

384
00:23:08,262 --> 00:23:10,056
Talk amongst yourselves.
Exchange info.

385
00:23:10,139 --> 00:23:11,140
Thanks.

386
00:23:13,142 --> 00:23:15,894
-What was that about?
-We're starting a band.

387
00:23:16,895 --> 00:23:19,148
I told them to keep in touch. Talk.

388
00:23:19,231 --> 00:23:22,568
You starting a support group?
Will you be participating?

389
00:23:22,651 --> 00:23:25,529
Like I'd waste my time circle jerking
with a bunch of whiners.

390
00:23:25,612 --> 00:23:28,282
Yes, you are a paragon of mental health.

391
00:23:32,161 --> 00:23:34,621
I'm using them, Hogarth.

392
00:23:34,705 --> 00:23:38,792
I wanna know everything they did with him,
everywhere they went,

393
00:23:38,875 --> 00:23:42,713
every word that was said,
particularly about me,

394
00:23:42,796 --> 00:23:44,923
and what the hell he's gonna do next.

395
00:23:45,007 --> 00:23:47,468
Kilgrave wanted a leather jacket,
live cello music,

396
00:23:47,551 --> 00:23:49,511
and the flattering smile
of a pretty girl.

397
00:23:49,595 --> 00:23:51,472
What a waste.

398
00:23:51,555 --> 00:23:53,599
He could solve so many problems
with his gift.

399
00:23:53,682 --> 00:23:54,891
Gift?

400
00:23:56,643 --> 00:23:59,188
I just meant, if...
if he was on our side.

401
00:23:59,271 --> 00:24:00,731
What side would that be?

402
00:24:01,565 --> 00:24:03,192
The side that uses people?

403
00:24:03,275 --> 00:24:04,568
Treats them like animals?

404
00:24:04,651 --> 00:24:05,777
Jessica, do not take this out on me.

405
00:24:05,861 --> 00:24:06,945
Just to throw them away
like garbage?

406
00:24:07,029 --> 00:24:09,948
The side that rips your life apart
and destroys you from the inside out?

407
00:24:10,032 --> 00:24:12,743
Whose side exactly would that be?

408
00:24:15,121 --> 00:24:16,330

Hey, I got your movie.

It's 30 hours.
Cast of thousands.

Thanks, I should've got some popcorn.

but your spy is in there somewhere.

What the hell are you looking at, huh?

-Hey, get off him!
-He's watching!

421
00:25:03,085 --> 00:25:04,795
Yeah, he's probably
watching the ceiling melt.

422
00:25:04,878 --> 00:25:06,672
He doesn't like me.

423

Malcolm, go sleep it off.

424
00:25:13,804 --> 00:25:15,181
Hey, I got enough to deal with

425
00:25:15,264 --> 00:25:17,808
without worrying about you going all
search and destroy on me.

426
00:25:17,891 --> 00:25:19,435
I know, I am...

I know how to turn it off, I...

Listen, there's this...

[sighs] group of people.

They've all been through
the same thing, so...

432
00:25:34,825 --> 00:25:38,995
if you wanna talk or something,
they meet tomorrow night.

433
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:41,748
Yeah, I'm not into it, either.

You don't have to worry about her,

You could have stopped that bus.

00:28:58,654 --> 00:29:00,572
I got something for you.

476
00:29:01,448 --> 00:29:03,742
I don't want anything from you.

477
00:29:05,411 --> 00:29:08,289
-Well, it might help. Please.
-[elevator dings]

478

Um...

479

It's personal.

480
00:29:18,674 --> 00:29:20,384
I can't let you in.

481
00:29:24,095 --> 00:29:25,847
Put it on the floor.

482
00:29:32,729 --> 00:29:34,981
Now go to the end of the hall.

483
00:30:21,570 --> 00:30:25,156
Uh, did you open it?

484
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:26,325
Yes.

485
00:30:29,786 --> 00:30:31,622
I just want you to feel safe.

486
00:30:35,250 --> 00:30:36,668
Is it legal?

487
00:30:38,379 --> 00:30:39,421
No.

488
00:30:48,263 --> 00:30:49,848
You still there?

Where-- Where is Carlo?

He's three feet to your right, asshole.

-Get her on the plastic!
-How?

514
00:34:25,021 --> 00:34:27,232
I have a gun on her,
for Christ's sake, Carlo.

515
00:34:27,315 --> 00:34:30,652
You shoot at me, I'll pull the bullet
out of my ruined jacket

516
00:34:30,736 --> 00:34:32,654
and shove it up your ass
with my pinky finger,

that's gonna hurt more?

-Nope, not bulletproof.

521
00:34:40,829 --> 00:34:42,706
Audrey, this is insane.
Honey, we don't have to do this.

522
00:34:42,789 --> 00:34:43,957
We can walk out of here right now--

She doesn't have laser eyes either,
or she would have used them.

Laser eyes?
Who said I had laser eyes?

Oh, that dick with the Aston Martin.
I served him a subpoena.

Gregory Spheeris. I sell to his wife.
They're very talky.

527
00:34:56,678 --> 00:34:58,680
Look, you're obviously
pissed off about something,

528
00:34:58,764 --> 00:35:02,684
but I'm pretty sure, for the first time,
this has nothing to do with Kilgrave.

529
00:35:02,768 --> 00:35:04,227
He's smarter than you two.

530
00:35:04,310 --> 00:35:08,189
Kilgrave? Who's Kilgrave?
Is he another one of you people?

531
00:35:08,273 --> 00:35:10,108
How many more are there like you?

532
00:35:10,191 --> 00:35:12,235
How many more what, private eyes?

533
00:35:12,318 --> 00:35:13,612
"Gifted."

534
00:35:13,695 --> 00:35:16,072
Stupid word.

535
00:35:16,156 --> 00:35:20,201
It's like calling someone "special."
They're not special, they're retarded.

536
00:35:20,285 --> 00:35:22,495
You're not gifted,
you're a freak.

537
00:35:23,371 --> 00:35:25,916
What have we or the mentally challenged
ever done to you?

538
00:35:25,999 --> 00:35:28,794
You saved the city.

539
00:35:28,877 --> 00:35:32,505
That's what the newspapers said.
You were "heroes."

540
00:35:33,715 --> 00:35:34,841
Not me.

541
00:35:34,925 --> 00:35:36,592
"The city was saved."

542
00:35:36,677 --> 00:35:39,512
But I was there.
I saw what really happened.

543
00:35:39,595 --> 00:35:41,264
I saw my mother crushed to death

544
00:35:41,347 --> 00:35:43,391
under a building
that you people destroyed.

545
00:35:43,474 --> 00:35:44,768
In the incident?

546
00:35:44,851 --> 00:35:47,145
I was trying
to pull my mother out from the rubble,

547
00:35:47,228 --> 00:35:49,064
watching her bleed to death,

548
00:35:49,147 --> 00:35:52,608
[sniffles] while all around me,
you people were raining down hell.

549
00:35:52,693 --> 00:35:55,445
So go after the big green guy
or the flag waver.

550
00:35:55,528 --> 00:35:56,780
I wasn't even there!

551
00:35:56,863 --> 00:35:59,991
Consider it a preventative measure
for next time. [sniffles]

552
00:36:01,492 --> 00:36:04,162
[Jessica] You think you're the only ones
who've lost people?

553
00:36:04,245 --> 00:36:06,122
You think you're the only ones with pain?

554
00:36:06,998 --> 00:36:09,835
You think you can take your shit
and dump it on me?

555
00:36:11,502 --> 00:36:12,628
You don't get to do that!

556
00:36:12,713 --> 00:36:15,548
So you take your goddamn pain
and you live with it, assholes!

557
00:36:15,631 --> 00:36:16,717
[Audrey screams]

558
00:36:17,926 --> 00:36:21,346
You lost your parents?
Welcome to the goddamn club!

559
00:36:21,429 --> 00:36:23,682
I lost mine in some random accident.

560
00:36:23,765 --> 00:36:27,435
Do you see me trying to kill
every shitty driver? No!

561
00:36:27,518 --> 00:36:30,063
Because I don't work my shit out
on other people!

562
00:36:30,146 --> 00:36:34,109
So keep your goddamn feelings
to yourselves!

563
00:36:38,238 --> 00:36:39,530
[panting]

564
00:36:41,074 --> 00:36:42,492
Ninety-nine.

565
00:36:44,077 --> 00:36:46,997
You wanted to know
how many of us there are?

566
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:49,249
The last time I counted,

567
00:36:49,332 --> 00:36:54,629
I had 99 gifted friends
in this borough alone.

568
00:36:55,296 --> 00:36:56,672
And now every single one of them

569
00:36:56,757 --> 00:36:59,968
is gonna know about this shit
that you tried to pull.

570
00:37:00,719 --> 00:37:03,596
And they hate attempted murder.

571
00:37:03,679 --> 00:37:05,348
They really do.

572
00:37:05,431 --> 00:37:10,270
The cops hate it, too, you know,
because it's against the law.

573
00:37:10,353 --> 00:37:12,814
Please don't kill us. [stammering]
We're gonna leave you alone.

574
00:37:12,898 --> 00:37:15,150
There's only one thing
that you can do to save yourselves.

575
00:37:15,233 --> 00:37:18,028
-What?
-Disappear.

576
00:37:18,111 --> 00:37:23,241
Nobody, especially me,
ever hears from you again.

577
00:37:24,075 --> 00:37:28,997
Me and my friends will stop by tomorrow
to make sure you heard me.

578
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:36,462
I want a divorce.

And this one guy

583
00:39:00,796 --> 00:39:06,052
stitched a silhouette of my hair
in orange sequins.

584
00:39:06,136 --> 00:39:09,180
And this girl sent me a stuffed, uh...

585
00:39:10,723 --> 00:39:13,559
It kind of looked like a voodoo doll.

586

[Simpson] Of you?

Me or Carrot Top.
It wasn't clear. [chuckles]

[Simpson chuckles] It's creepy.

589
00:39:22,861 --> 00:39:25,321
Well, it seemed normal at the time.

590
00:39:26,322 --> 00:39:31,202
My mother had been
marketing the Patsy dolls for years, so...

591
00:39:32,662 --> 00:39:34,372
Uh...

592
00:39:34,455 --> 00:39:37,333
[chuckling] The whole thing's
a little embarrassing now.

593
00:39:41,129 --> 00:39:43,173
I had G.I. Joes...

594
00:39:43,256 --> 00:39:44,715
till they all burned.

595
00:39:46,551 --> 00:39:48,053
Burned?

596
00:39:48,136 --> 00:39:50,596
They went into battle
to save my sister's Barbie

597
00:39:50,680 --> 00:39:53,349
and melted into one big clump.
[chuckles]

598
00:39:54,309 --> 00:39:56,061
That's terrible.

599
00:39:56,144 --> 00:39:58,854
Hey! They accomplished their mission.

600
00:39:58,939 --> 00:40:02,608
-By dying?
-They rescued Barbie.

601
00:40:02,692 --> 00:40:06,487
I mean, the Dream House was gutted,
but she had insurance.

602
00:40:06,571 --> 00:40:09,199
You used actual fire?

603
00:40:09,282 --> 00:40:11,326
You torched a Dream House?

604
00:40:11,409 --> 00:40:14,245
-I was committed to the scenario.

-[Simpson] Yeah.
-Mmm.

606
00:40:18,083 --> 00:40:22,503
That was meant to be a story about how
I've always been the guy saving people.

607
00:40:22,587 --> 00:40:25,423
Albeit plastic people and they melted.

608
00:40:25,506 --> 00:40:28,759
Well, I just need you to know that.

609
00:40:28,843 --> 00:40:31,179
The guy who tried to kill you...

610
00:40:33,681 --> 00:40:35,183
it wasn't me.

611
00:40:40,605 --> 00:40:42,482
I don't blame you.

612
00:40:42,565 --> 00:40:45,568
Well, you're doing better than me.
[sighs]

613
00:40:45,651 --> 00:40:48,404
I tried to fight it.

614

I couldn't.

615
00:40:50,949 --> 00:40:52,867
Hey, listen.

616
00:40:52,951 --> 00:40:55,996
What Kilgrave did to you,
he did to Jessica.

617
00:40:57,830 --> 00:41:00,416
It doesn't matter how strong you are.

618
00:41:03,586 --> 00:41:06,839
Maybe not,
but we can protect ourselves.

619
00:41:13,972 --> 00:41:15,598
Trish?

620
00:41:20,811 --> 00:41:23,106
I might shoot you by accident.

621
00:41:24,107 --> 00:41:25,900
It's worth the risk.

[inaudible]

623

-You went back to work?
-I had to.

624
00:42:20,371 --> 00:42:24,875
-I needed things to feel normal again.
-Yeah, so did I.

625
00:42:24,959 --> 00:42:26,502
Ah, you're a New York City cop.

626
00:42:26,586 --> 00:42:31,132
I'm sure your "normal"
is pretty crazy to begin with.

627
00:42:31,216 --> 00:42:33,718
Unlike being an actress.

628
00:42:33,801 --> 00:42:35,636
Completely sane profession. [laughs]

00:42:35,720 --> 00:42:37,638

00:42:48,816 --> 00:42:52,195
<i>Maybe it should be.</i>
<i>You need to process your trauma.</i>

635
00:42:52,278 --> 00:42:53,321
[sighs] I'm sorry, who is this?

636
00:42:53,404 --> 00:42:57,617
<i>Fine. You need to not take</i>
<i>your crap out on my glass walls.</i>

637
00:42:57,700 --> 00:42:58,701
Put it on my tab.

638
00:42:58,784 --> 00:43:01,329
<i>When are you planning to pay that off?</i>

639
00:43:01,412 --> 00:43:04,290
Not tonight, Hogarth.
Not tonight.

640
00:43:06,542 --> 00:43:11,131
Avery was crying because I forgot
to put his action figures in the car.

641
00:43:11,214 --> 00:43:15,760
He'd been fussy all morning,
and in the car, he was just impossible.

642
00:43:15,843 --> 00:43:17,678
I lost my temper.

643
00:43:17,762 --> 00:43:19,847
Then we hit a red light
just south of Herald Square,

644
00:43:19,930 --> 00:43:23,601
and Kilgrave just opened the door
and got in.

645
00:43:23,684 --> 00:43:27,230
Said he liked my car,
wanted to ride around.

646
00:43:29,857 --> 00:43:32,235
Avery was still crying,

647
00:43:32,318 --> 00:43:34,737
but Kilgrave never once looked at him.

648
00:43:34,820 --> 00:43:37,490
He just stared straight ahead and said...

649
00:43:38,533 --> 00:43:42,036
"You'd like to leave your son,
wouldn't you?"

650
00:43:42,120 --> 00:43:44,330
And I said yes.

651
00:43:44,414 --> 00:43:48,376
I pulled Avery out, put him on the curb,
and drove away.

652
00:43:50,085 --> 00:43:54,215
I saw him in my rear-view mirror,
just weeping on the sidewalk,

653
00:43:54,299 --> 00:43:57,760
and I hated myself because...
it's what I wanted.

654
00:43:59,845 --> 00:44:03,808
I disappeared for a week
while I was Kilgrave's chauffeur.

655
00:44:05,518 --> 00:44:08,604
I was charged with child abandonment.

656
00:44:08,688 --> 00:44:12,192
My wife left me, which [scoffs]
I don't blame her, because--

657
00:44:12,275 --> 00:44:14,569
You drove him for a week?

658
00:44:14,652 --> 00:44:16,321
24/7?

659
00:44:16,404 --> 00:44:18,573
Yeah, it was a nightmare.
I was haunted by--

660
00:44:18,656 --> 00:44:19,824
Where did you drive him?

661
00:44:19,907 --> 00:44:22,743
-I'm not sure that's the--
-Did he meet anyone in particular?

662
00:44:22,827 --> 00:44:24,579
Did anyone deliver pictures to him?

663
00:44:24,662 --> 00:44:26,247
-Um, actually, yeah.
-Who?

664
00:44:27,165 --> 00:44:29,750
I don't know, I just had to drive Kilgrave
to meet the same guy

665
00:44:29,834 --> 00:44:31,377
every day at 10:00 a.m. on the dot.

666
00:44:31,461 --> 00:44:33,087
-He was very punctual.
-What did he look like?

667
00:44:33,171 --> 00:44:35,173
Is this some kind of
reenactment therapy?

668
00:44:35,256 --> 00:44:37,800
Screw therapy.
What did he look like, the guy he met?

669
00:44:37,883 --> 00:44:41,136
Well, [scoffs] I never got close,
and it was freezing.

670
00:44:41,221 --> 00:44:43,806
Everyone's wrapped
in tons of layers and hats.

671
00:44:43,889 --> 00:44:46,058
He wore a scarf.

672
00:44:46,141 --> 00:44:47,685
Blue and white stripes.

673
00:45:51,874 --> 00:45:52,958
[lock breaking]

674
00:46:53,811 --> 00:46:55,813
[dramatic music playing]
