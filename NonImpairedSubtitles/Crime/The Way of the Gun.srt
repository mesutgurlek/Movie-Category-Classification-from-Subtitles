1
00:00:38,650 --> 00:00:40,880
Hey. Yeah, you. Get up.

2
00:00:42,254 --> 00:00:45,746
What are you, retarded?
Get off the fucking car!

3
00:00:46,458 --> 00:00:49,916
Hey, dickless, get off
the fucking car!

4
00:00:50,963 --> 00:00:54,990
Hey, fucksuck, get your slippery
fucking ass off the car!

5
00:00:55,300 --> 00:00:58,599
Listen to me! Get off the fucking
car with your fucking ass!

6
00:00:58,804 --> 00:01:02,103
Shut that cunt 's mouth, or I'll
come over and fuck-start her head!

7
00:01:06,812 --> 00:01:09,542
Do something. Go.

8
00:01:13,085 --> 00:01:16,521
You're gonna wish you never
got up this morning, asshole...

9
00:01:16,722 --> 00:01:20,249
because my boyfriend's gonna
fuck you up. And then after that...

10
00:01:20,459 --> 00:01:25,021
while he's fucking up your gay
uncle, I'll cut off your cock...

11
00:01:25,230 --> 00:01:27,755
and mail it to your mother,
your fucking faggot bitch!

12
00:01:28,333 --> 00:01:33,464
Gaylord fucking bitch! How do you
like that? A lot? Fucking faggot!

13
00:01:33,672 --> 00:01:37,335
You like to ass-fuck?
Want a fucking head-fuck?

14
00:01:38,910 --> 00:01:42,209
You like to fuck baby heads?
You like to fuck boys?

15
00:01:42,414 --> 00:01:46,475
He'll fuck you in the ass! He's not
even gay, but he'll do it just....

16
00:01:46,685 --> 00:01:47,845
Honey. Honey.

17
00:01:48,053 --> 00:01:53,320
She's got a big mouth, but she's not
kidding. I'm gonna whip you silly.

18
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:57,126
You want to do the man-dance?
First dance's yours.

19
00:02:20,419 --> 00:02:23,911
Why would you pick a fight
with them? Why?! Look at me!

20
00:02:24,122 --> 00:02:26,920
-Look at my fucking face!
-You're more beautiful than ever!

21
00:02:40,539 --> 00:02:45,738
<i>I'll call myself Mr. Parker</i>.
<i>My associate will be Mr. Longbaugh</i>.

22
00:03:50,742 --> 00:03:55,270
<i>There is a natural order</i>,
<i>the way things are meant to be</i>.

23
00:03:55,480 --> 00:04:00,110
<i>The order says the good guys always</i>
<i>win</i>,<i>you die when it's your time</i>...

24
00:04:00,318 --> 00:04:04,311
<i>or you have it coming</i>,
<i>and the ending is always happy</i>...

25
00:04:04,523 --> 00:04:06,457
<i>if only for someone else</i>.

26
00:04:07,392 --> 00:04:12,489
<i>Our path had been chosen and we</i>
<i>had nothing to offer the world</i>...

27
00:04:12,697 --> 00:04:16,793
<i>our options narrowing down</i>
<i>to petty crime or minimum wage</i>.

28
00:04:17,002 --> 00:04:20,563
<i>So we stepped off the path</i>...

29
00:04:20,872 --> 00:04:24,933
<i>and went looking for the fortune</i>
<i>that we knew was looking for us</i>.

30
00:04:25,177 --> 00:04:28,613
<i>Once off the path</i>,<i>you do what</i>
<i>you can to eat</i>, <i>to keep moving</i>.

31
00:04:28,814 --> 00:04:33,751
<i>You don't blow your chance with</i>
<i>nickel-and-dime. No comforts</i>.

32
00:04:33,952 --> 00:04:36,819
<i>Need is the ultimate monkey</i>.

33
00:04:37,189 --> 00:04:42,286
<i>A pint of your blood can fetch you</i>
<i>50 bucks. A shot of cum</i>,<i>3 grand</i>.

34
00:04:42,494 --> 00:04:45,361
<i>You keep your life simple</i>,
<i>and you can literally self-sustain</i>.

35
00:04:45,564 --> 00:04:50,024
-What qualifies you as a donor?
-I'd say I'm a fairly intelligent...

36
00:04:50,468 --> 00:04:54,165
good-looking man,
physically fit, stable.

37
00:04:54,906 --> 00:04:56,567
Thank you, mister.

38
00:04:58,376 --> 00:05:00,537
Heterosexual?

39
00:05:03,014 --> 00:05:04,982
-Can I ask you something?
-Sure.

40
00:05:05,717 --> 00:05:09,983
Are you a faggot? See, you asked me
if I was heterosexual.

41
00:05:10,188 --> 00:05:13,715
I asked you the same, only I was
clear about the answer I wanted.

42
00:05:13,925 --> 00:05:17,759
-I asked if you were heterosexual.
-I've never killed a man.

43
00:05:18,563 --> 00:05:20,394
-I beg your pardon?
-I said I've never killed a man.

44
00:05:20,599 --> 00:05:24,262
-I didn't ask you if you had.
-You asked why I was qualified.

45
00:05:25,070 --> 00:05:29,336
I wonder why that strikes you
as important for semen donation.

46
00:05:29,541 --> 00:05:32,339
It 's a big fucking.... Excuse me,
a very important qualification.

47
00:05:32,577 --> 00:05:35,603
-No one's ever said that before.
-Have you ever asked?

48
00:05:36,348 --> 00:05:38,407
-No.
-You should.

49
00:05:38,917 --> 00:05:44,048
Take Los Angeles, okay? If I say
that Los Angeles has become...

50
00:05:44,256 --> 00:05:48,886
a Mecca for homosexual migration,
I'm right. But look at what I said.

51
00:05:49,094 --> 00:05:54,896
I make it sound like faggots are
miscreants who need to move around.

52
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:58,263
I'm also likening them to Muslims,
or Muslims to them.

53
00:05:58,470 --> 00:06:01,735
-"LA's full of faggots" is honest.
-Why is that a big deal?

54
00:06:01,940 --> 00:06:04,636
-Nobody brings up necrophilia!
-Of course they don't. It 's sick.

55
00:06:04,843 --> 00:06:08,677
-You brought it up. I didn't ask.
-You should.

56
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:11,371
"Faggot." Just say it.

57
00:06:11,616 --> 00:06:14,585
-I can't say that.
-Funny. If I grab a woman's ass...

58
00:06:14,786 --> 00:06:17,687
and she punches me,
she's fighting for her rights.

59
00:06:17,889 --> 00:06:22,053
But if a faggot grabs my ass and
I punch him, I'm a homophobe.

60
00:06:22,260 --> 00:06:26,321
-Let 's just move on.
-Are... you... a faggot?

61
00:06:26,531 --> 00:06:28,465
Any trace of mental
illness in the family?

62
00:06:28,667 --> 00:06:33,604
It 's not what you say anymore,
is it? It 's all in how you say it.

63
00:06:34,439 --> 00:06:36,703
Yeah, can you hold on just a sec?

64
00:06:36,908 --> 00:06:39,433
Where were we?
Okay, listen.

65
00:06:39,644 --> 00:06:44,479
Let 's pretend you don't smoke and
and overlook the coke breakfasts.

66
00:06:44,683 --> 00:06:48,517
Let 's imagine you get your life
together and get up before noon.

67
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:52,918
Steff, please! You're still not
cut out to be a surrogate mother.

68
00:06:53,892 --> 00:06:59,023
Look, there's a girl comes in here,
due any day, getting paid a million.

69
00:06:59,230 --> 00:07:01,425
Sounds like a lot? Wrong.

70
00:07:01,633 --> 00:07:05,194
She comes in for treatment three times
before the damn embryo takes.

71
00:07:05,403 --> 00:07:08,395
Turns out the couple
is perfectly healthy.

72
00:07:08,606 --> 00:07:11,734
I guess the wife just couldn't be
bothered to carry her own child.

73
00:07:11,943 --> 00:07:17,279
They tell the girl what to eat, when
to go out, bodyguards watch her.

74
00:07:17,482 --> 00:07:23,318
Of course it 's fishy. It 's what I'm
saying. She's gotta live with them.

75
00:07:23,555 --> 00:07:26,786
Poor girl's like a prisoner.
It 's just not worth it.

76
00:07:27,359 --> 00:07:31,090
Look, if that 's what you feel,
then go with God! I don't know!

77
00:07:31,296 --> 00:07:33,856
Why do you call and ask,
if you're not gonna listen?

78
00:07:34,065 --> 00:07:37,125
Just call the doctor,
maybe he could help you.

79
00:07:37,335 --> 00:07:40,031
No, he's in the book. His name's
Painter. Allen Painter.

80
00:07:47,178 --> 00:07:50,944
<i>And here was the thing: some deep</i>
<i>pockets</i>,<i>a pregnant woman</i>...

81
00:07:51,149 --> 00:07:53,811
<i>some bodyguards</i>
<i>and a doctor's name</i>.

82
00:07:54,919 --> 00:07:58,480
<i>The longest distance between two</i>
<i>points is a kidnapper and his money</i>.

83
00:07:58,690 --> 00:08:00,487
<i>But we were through jerking off</i>.

84
00:08:01,059 --> 00:08:04,586
Feel that, hon? It 's fantastic.

85
00:08:04,796 --> 00:08:08,288
Yes. It 's fabulous, Hale.

86
00:08:16,574 --> 00:08:19,065
She doesn't hate you, Robin.

87
00:08:20,712 --> 00:08:23,681
She most certainly
does, Mr. Chidduck.

88
00:08:27,519 --> 00:08:31,455
-You're worried about the baby.
-No, it 's...

89
00:08:31,656 --> 00:08:36,116
Come on. A woman needs security
like a man needs approval.

90
00:08:36,327 --> 00:08:41,629
She wants her past, present and
future to all be secure. Right now.

91
00:08:43,268 --> 00:08:48,228
And in a few days, this baby
will be a part of your past.

92
00:08:49,474 --> 00:08:52,568
And for you to leave
and not know it 's secure....

93
00:08:54,312 --> 00:09:00,376
I would never ask you to trust me.
It 's the cry of a guilty soul.

94
00:09:00,919 --> 00:09:05,913
But trust life. Always trust life.

95
00:09:06,891 --> 00:09:12,830
If you're careful enough to listen,
life does take care.

96
00:09:16,668 --> 00:09:19,432
You're gonna be a good father.

97
00:09:19,704 --> 00:09:22,172
She's gonna be a good
mother. You'll see.

98
00:09:22,373 --> 00:09:28,710
As soon as she lays eyes on him,
nature will take over. I know it.

99
00:09:30,715 --> 00:09:33,616
I hope to God you're right, Robin.

100
00:09:34,719 --> 00:09:37,711
Because if this baby
doesn't change....

101
00:09:44,963 --> 00:09:47,295
"Him"?

102
00:09:51,703 --> 00:09:55,366
You didn't want to know.
I'm sorry, I....

103
00:10:01,513 --> 00:10:05,347
-You did say "him".
-"Him".

104
00:10:10,755 --> 00:10:14,213
I have to go to the appointment
now with Dr. Painter.

105
00:10:14,425 --> 00:10:16,017
I'm going to have a son.

106
00:10:18,096 --> 00:10:20,496
I'm going to have a son.

107
00:10:33,044 --> 00:10:37,140
-So I didn't spoil it, then?
-No, you didn't spoil it.

108
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:51,628
Right? Right.

109
00:10:55,066 --> 00:10:56,863
Come on!

110
00:10:59,070 --> 00:11:01,903
Every goddamn time.

111
00:11:22,093 --> 00:11:24,994
-Four to One.
<i>-Go ahead. One</i>.

112
00:11:26,397 --> 00:11:29,560
I'm sure it 's nothing, but could
you just drive by the building?

113
00:11:41,145 --> 00:11:45,411
-How's your back feeling?
-It 's better. Yes, it 's better.

114
00:11:45,617 --> 00:11:47,608
Down here?

115
00:11:51,422 --> 00:11:54,516
Bet you can't wait for
this little guy to get out.

116
00:11:54,726 --> 00:11:58,594
Actually, I don't mind
if it stays in there forever.

117
00:12:07,572 --> 00:12:11,474
So, unless there are complications,
I won't see you until the 15th.

118
00:12:12,310 --> 00:12:16,406
The video I told you about. Things
you should know about your delivery.

119
00:12:16,681 --> 00:12:18,706
Thanks.

120
00:13:30,988 --> 00:13:35,049
We want this to go down nice
and quiet, so put the guns down.

121
00:13:36,694 --> 00:13:41,154
-Guys, we got you. It 's over. What?
-The people, man. The people.

122
00:13:44,001 --> 00:13:47,129
Can't you people see
there are guns here?

123
00:13:48,539 --> 00:13:51,599
Get the fuck out!

124
00:13:51,976 --> 00:13:54,069
Get out!

125
00:13:57,515 --> 00:14:03,476
Come on, this is no good. Put the
guns down. I'll count to three....

126
00:14:04,922 --> 00:14:07,823
What the fuck are you doing? You're
supposed to be protecting her!

127
00:14:08,493 --> 00:14:12,259
-Fuck. What 'd I tell you?
-Walk away.

128
00:14:13,431 --> 00:14:18,232
Just walk away. They don't care
about dying, just losing!

129
00:14:18,903 --> 00:14:23,738
You won't make it out of here alive,
you know the cops are gonna come!

130
00:14:23,941 --> 00:14:26,171
Just walk away!

131
00:14:27,545 --> 00:14:30,105
Move! Move, yes!

132
00:14:30,381 --> 00:14:33,714
Relax, relax. Moving.

133
00:14:41,125 --> 00:14:43,150
-I got her.
-Okay.

134
00:15:03,781 --> 00:15:06,215
-Moving.
-Move.

135
00:15:11,222 --> 00:15:13,952
-Moving?
-No.

136
00:15:14,225 --> 00:15:16,716
-Moving?
-Move.

137
00:15:20,097 --> 00:15:21,962
-Get her.
-Move.

138
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:24,324
It 's okay.

139
00:15:26,871 --> 00:15:28,805
Move!

140
00:15:33,911 --> 00:15:38,007
Four to One. They made a pass.
They're coming out. Do not....

141
00:15:39,217 --> 00:15:40,809
Take the girl.

142
00:15:47,191 --> 00:15:48,590
Do not go to the doctor's office.

143
00:15:48,793 --> 00:15:51,455
Go to the top floor and wait for me
for as long as it takes.

144
00:15:51,662 --> 00:15:54,392
Do you understand me? Do you?

145
00:15:54,599 --> 00:15:56,567
-Yes!
-Go.

146
00:15:58,002 --> 00:15:59,560
Wait for me.

147
00:16:52,290 --> 00:16:53,518
Right this way!

148
00:16:59,397 --> 00:17:03,060
Do you care about this baby?
Then you walk.

149
00:17:05,136 --> 00:17:06,763
Cover!

150
00:17:15,580 --> 00:17:17,104
Move!

151
00:17:52,016 --> 00:17:54,985
Are you okay? Miss?

152
00:17:55,753 --> 00:17:58,085
The baby is kicking.

153
00:17:58,556 --> 00:18:02,583
The guns and noise...
the baby is kicking like crazy.

154
00:18:03,694 --> 00:18:05,184
Please!

155
00:18:11,669 --> 00:18:13,364
Relax!

156
00:18:18,743 --> 00:18:20,904
Could you be easy, please?

157
00:18:23,347 --> 00:18:26,942
-You can open your eyes now.
-I don't want to look at you.

158
00:18:27,818 --> 00:18:29,376
It doesn't matter.

159
00:18:49,740 --> 00:18:51,298
All right.

160
00:18:52,109 --> 00:18:55,738
-Follow me, Tonto.
-All right, give them room.

161
00:22:17,381 --> 00:22:20,111
-What 's your name?
-Robin.

162
00:22:20,317 --> 00:22:24,981
-And the father?
-You had it all figured out, huh?

163
00:22:27,191 --> 00:22:30,024
Listen, the sooner you tell us who
the money is, the sooner....

164
00:22:30,261 --> 00:22:32,126
The sooner I end up dead.

165
00:22:33,864 --> 00:22:37,265
I know that as long as
I'm carrying this baby...

166
00:22:37,768 --> 00:22:41,602
and you two don't have
the money, I'm alive.

167
00:22:41,805 --> 00:22:45,969
We're not talking about how long
you'll live, but how slow you'll die.

168
00:22:50,147 --> 00:22:52,672
What do you call your baby?

169
00:22:54,285 --> 00:22:57,379
-It 's not mine.
-Like that matters.

170
00:22:57,755 --> 00:23:00,553
He have to have a name.

171
00:23:01,659 --> 00:23:07,393
What do you think when you
think about deaf people...

172
00:23:07,598 --> 00:23:12,058
people who are born deaf,
who never heard a spoken word?

173
00:23:12,269 --> 00:23:18,504
What do they call the son, their mother
or their own reflection in the mirror?

174
00:23:22,012 --> 00:23:26,608
That 's what I call it.
There's no name.

175
00:23:27,318 --> 00:23:30,810
I'm not gonna name it. For what?

176
00:24:39,890 --> 00:24:42,859
-Help.
-Shit.

177
00:25:04,515 --> 00:25:06,779
<i>Dr. Painter</i>, <i>this is Colleen</i>
<i>at your message service</i>.

178
00:25:06,984 --> 00:25:09,612
<i>I've got an emergency call</i>
<i>from Robin</i>.

179
00:25:10,454 --> 00:25:14,754
<i>-It's hard to say it</i>,<i>but I can't</i>.
<i>-You said you'd tell me anything</i>.

180
00:25:19,963 --> 00:25:21,590
<i>It's not illegal</i>,<i>is it?</i>

181
00:25:24,701 --> 00:25:26,032
<i>No</i>,<i>Daddy</i>.

182
00:25:28,472 --> 00:25:30,633
<i>That was a stupid thing to ask</i>.

183
00:26:34,304 --> 00:26:37,762
-He's a doctor. He'll obey us.
-I need help!

184
00:26:38,008 --> 00:26:42,377
-You have too much faith in people.
-How to kidnap somebody without it?

185
00:27:44,041 --> 00:27:46,134
Let 's fake it.

186
00:27:50,447 --> 00:27:52,642
Would you get me Mr. Chidduck?

187
00:28:12,369 --> 00:28:15,566
Hi, Robin. Look at me.

188
00:28:15,772 --> 00:28:19,833
-Talk to me. How do you feel?
-I'm dizzy. I'm not gonna make it.

189
00:28:20,077 --> 00:28:22,875
-You're gonna make it.
-Am I gonna have it?

190
00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:26,106
-How long since you drank water?
-I don't know.

191
00:28:37,127 --> 00:28:41,029
You do what I say, you understand
me? You do what I say!

192
00:28:58,282 --> 00:29:02,150
If anything happens to me,
if this all goes terribly wrong...

193
00:29:02,352 --> 00:29:05,253
It already has gone
terribly wrong.

194
00:29:07,024 --> 00:29:08,924
I'm sorry.

195
00:29:13,230 --> 00:29:18,497
Just get me a fucking figure.
What kind of a kidnapping is this?

196
00:29:18,702 --> 00:29:23,036
Aren't we in the demands phase
at this point?

197
00:29:23,407 --> 00:29:26,433
<i>-You can't pay</i>,<i>Hale</i>.
-Certainly I can.

198
00:29:26,643 --> 00:29:31,137
<i>It's not about the money</i>, <i>the life</i>
<i>of the girl</i>,<i>even the child</i>.

199
00:29:31,348 --> 00:29:36,684
<i>They get caught crossing</i>
<i>the border</i>,<i>running a red light</i>...

200
00:29:36,887 --> 00:29:39,253
<i>that money is coming</i>
<i>right back to you</i>.

201
00:29:39,456 --> 00:29:45,292
<i>You'll have to account for it</i>,
<i>explain. Understand what I said?</i>

202
00:29:45,495 --> 00:29:48,089
<i>You cannot pay</i>.

203
00:29:49,966 --> 00:29:53,868
Joe, can't you just go over and...

204
00:29:54,071 --> 00:29:58,132
whatever, you know...
rub them out?

205
00:29:58,342 --> 00:30:00,572
<i>No</i>,<i>no</i>.

206
00:30:00,777 --> 00:30:03,644
<i>If we call the police</i>,
<i>surround them</i>,<i>sweat them out</i>...

207
00:30:03,847 --> 00:30:08,648
<i>they only have their lives. We</i>
<i>don't have to negotiate. They do</i>.

208
00:30:08,852 --> 00:30:13,482
<i>Robin is their only chip. They have</i>
<i>to give her up. It's that simple</i>.

209
00:30:13,690 --> 00:30:18,127
<i>You keep your money</i>, <i>the girl</i>,
<i>and nobody looks at your books</i>.

210
00:30:22,699 --> 00:30:24,599
I can't.

211
00:30:31,508 --> 00:30:36,775
No! No police!
Just, you know...

212
00:30:37,581 --> 00:30:40,209
hell, figure it out!

213
00:30:43,987 --> 00:30:49,482
She's dehydrated. The pain
can feel very much like labor.

214
00:30:50,060 --> 00:30:53,325
-But she won't lose the baby.
-No.

215
00:30:53,597 --> 00:30:57,089
-But she'll have it within 6 days.
-Don't lie to me, Doc.

216
00:30:58,034 --> 00:31:02,368
I'm not gonna lie. I'm concerned
for the health of my patient.

217
00:31:03,673 --> 00:31:08,667
The baby is over eight pounds
and should come out by the 15th.

218
00:31:10,947 --> 00:31:13,108
Don't push us, man.

219
00:31:14,885 --> 00:31:18,343
-Can't she have it sooner?
-You mean, induce?

220
00:31:18,555 --> 00:31:22,423
-Here? Absolutely not.
-Don't hand me that, Doc.

221
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:25,390
-First baby was born in a cave.
-Because it had to be.

222
00:31:25,595 --> 00:31:29,053
-What if he had to?
-Yeah.

223
00:31:29,699 --> 00:31:34,329
-As for baby and mother surviving....
-Forget that. Who are the parents?

224
00:31:37,808 --> 00:31:40,003
You guys don't....

225
00:31:44,614 --> 00:31:48,550
-Who are the parents?
-Francesca and Hale Chidduck.

226
00:31:49,586 --> 00:31:53,454
Oil and steel Chidducks,
Vegas union-busters Chidducks?

227
00:31:53,690 --> 00:31:55,988
-You guys have never...?
-It 's not our crowd.

228
00:31:56,193 --> 00:32:02,029
He's a front man for developers
who cut in on rough territory.

229
00:32:02,499 --> 00:32:07,801
Sometimes he launders money
out of Mexico. He's fucking crazy.

230
00:32:08,672 --> 00:32:13,632
Makes his living collecting other
people's enemies, shooting them.

231
00:32:13,844 --> 00:32:16,938
This is their worst nightmare, and
you don't know who you grabbed?

232
00:32:17,247 --> 00:32:19,442
How much money this guy have?

233
00:32:20,550 --> 00:32:22,882
-I have no idea.
-Will he deal?

234
00:32:25,355 --> 00:32:27,846
Anything to keep it quiet.

235
00:34:26,910 --> 00:34:28,605
<i>Abner?</i>

236
00:34:28,812 --> 00:34:32,111
-Joe!
<i>-You busy?</i>

237
00:34:33,216 --> 00:34:35,514
No, not at all.

238
00:34:35,852 --> 00:34:40,118
-You drunk?
<i>-A little. What can I do for you?</i>

239
00:34:40,323 --> 00:34:42,553
I need you to stay with somebody.

240
00:34:42,826 --> 00:34:46,057
She needs medical supervision.

241
00:34:46,262 --> 00:34:50,426
-She's not well. Let me stay.
-Don't get smart with me, Doc.

242
00:34:50,634 --> 00:34:53,102
Superman never gets the girl.

243
00:34:53,937 --> 00:34:56,235
-What 's this?
-It 's the ransom note.

244
00:34:56,439 --> 00:34:59,567
Just sit tight with this
Chidduck guy. We'll be in touch.

245
00:34:59,776 --> 00:35:04,236
You're gonna be the bagman. You'll
meet me in Mexico with the money.

246
00:35:04,614 --> 00:35:08,607
She'll be with my partner. You and
I won't know where until he calls.

247
00:35:09,352 --> 00:35:13,220
You'll come alone and you'll come
equipped to induce labor.

248
00:35:13,456 --> 00:35:17,552
Not, she dies.
You're followed, she dies.

249
00:35:17,761 --> 00:35:21,595
If I don't answer the phone
when my partner calls, she dies.

250
00:35:21,798 --> 00:35:26,701
It 's on your head now. The more
careful you are, the less I worry.

251
00:35:26,903 --> 00:35:30,930
-Got me? That baby's coming out.
-I understand.

252
00:35:32,709 --> 00:35:34,506
Right.

253
00:35:36,012 --> 00:35:38,412
You got a number for this thing?

254
00:35:39,416 --> 00:35:43,045
Don't say "Who? Me?
He? She?" You got a number?

255
00:35:53,697 --> 00:35:56,393
We'll call you when
we're ready. Go.

256
00:36:18,121 --> 00:36:21,955
Are you going to eat that
other half of your sandwich?

257
00:36:25,061 --> 00:36:29,589
-I was, but... are you hungry?
-Yes. I'm pregnant.

258
00:36:49,986 --> 00:36:53,854
-I like bacon.
-It 's from a gas station.

259
00:36:54,924 --> 00:36:57,222
It 's still good.

260
00:37:07,137 --> 00:37:09,071
Thanks.

261
00:37:25,488 --> 00:37:30,983
<i>The shooting began after they</i>
<i>kidnapped an unidentified woman</i>.

262
00:37:57,453 --> 00:37:59,318
Thanks, Jack.

263
00:38:07,063 --> 00:38:09,623
-Which one of you is Jeffers?
-Who are you?

264
00:38:09,833 --> 00:38:14,702
Of course. I'm Joe Sarno.
Mr. Chidduck sent me.

265
00:38:14,904 --> 00:38:17,099
-When can we...?
-We're working on your release now.

266
00:38:17,807 --> 00:38:20,241
The police are not ready
to charge you, but...

267
00:38:21,711 --> 00:38:24,737
they are a bit upset that no one
will tell them what 's going on.

268
00:38:24,948 --> 00:38:28,406
-Are you a lawyer?
-Do I look like a fucking lawyer?

269
00:38:30,920 --> 00:38:33,684
I handle Mr. Chidduck's laundry.

270
00:38:34,090 --> 00:38:37,890
Things like you. I make
unpleasant decisions for him...

271
00:38:38,094 --> 00:38:42,588
of which he can and never will
know. And he sleeps very well.

272
00:38:42,799 --> 00:38:44,357
You're a bagman.

273
00:38:46,436 --> 00:38:52,705
Let 's just say I deal in the fine
art of adjudication. Now...

274
00:38:52,909 --> 00:38:56,174
Obecks, is it?
What did you tell the cops?

275
00:38:57,080 --> 00:39:00,811
Cop want to know why there was two
dead bodyguards and nobody to guard.

276
00:39:01,017 --> 00:39:04,418
I told him we took the client out,
the client 's name was confidential.

277
00:39:04,621 --> 00:39:07,556
He asked who took the client out,
I told him that was confidential.

278
00:39:07,757 --> 00:39:11,784
He said the client was a witness. I
said no, it was before the shooting.

279
00:39:11,995 --> 00:39:15,123
He said I had all the answers. I
said, yes, because it 's the truth.

280
00:39:16,466 --> 00:39:21,130
Was there a time when one of the
deceased could've been in touch...?

281
00:39:21,337 --> 00:39:24,431
-Wait. You don't think...?
-No, I don't think.

282
00:39:24,641 --> 00:39:28,475
Nor do I assume, speculate
or hypothesize.

283
00:39:28,778 --> 00:39:31,042
I merely observe.

284
00:39:31,648 --> 00:39:33,980
And what I observe...

285
00:39:34,684 --> 00:39:38,620
is one frantic fuck-up on what
should be a routine exec protect.

286
00:39:39,022 --> 00:39:44,790
Two yahoos wipe out half his
staff coming out of a building...

287
00:39:44,994 --> 00:39:51,263
in broad daylight,
empty-handed, empty-handed.

288
00:39:52,502 --> 00:39:55,494
-How can this happen, I ask?
-She was running.

289
00:39:55,738 --> 00:39:58,229
-Unlikely.
-She took that kid for herself.

290
00:39:58,441 --> 00:40:02,468
I had her in the box. You think a
woman with a baby in her belly...

291
00:40:02,679 --> 00:40:05,477
is going to walk into a hail of
pistol fire for some fresh air?

292
00:40:05,682 --> 00:40:09,209
-For weeks she acted hinky.
-She's out of our sight a minute...

293
00:40:09,419 --> 00:40:13,355
in nine months, and she goes
for the door. She was....

294
00:40:18,127 --> 00:40:22,826
-You picked her to be the host.
-So naturally it 's our fault, right?

295
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:26,360
-Fuck me.
-Well...

296
00:40:27,103 --> 00:40:32,302
I am, to say the least,
perplexed as well as frustrated.

297
00:40:32,608 --> 00:40:37,443
It is Mr. Chidduck's wish that you
two idiots remain in this employ.

298
00:40:37,914 --> 00:40:41,645
He speaks very highly of you.

299
00:40:42,218 --> 00:40:45,813
He feels you will be extremely
motivated in resolving this matter.

300
00:40:46,356 --> 00:40:51,487
Despite my urging him to fire your
ass and have you fed to the fish.

301
00:40:52,261 --> 00:40:55,753
Beyond this, the matter's
been left to my discretion.

302
00:40:55,965 --> 00:40:58,160
The aforementioned
art of adjudication.

303
00:41:01,404 --> 00:41:03,838
Precisely, Mr. Jeffers.

304
00:41:04,507 --> 00:41:08,910
To wit, should another
macabre spectacle...

305
00:41:09,112 --> 00:41:12,513
like the one that presented
itself this afternoon take place...

306
00:41:12,715 --> 00:41:14,945
you will be cut loose...

307
00:41:15,218 --> 00:41:19,518
and then, Mr. Jeffers,
I will have my druthers.

308
00:41:22,125 --> 00:41:26,789
I promise a day of reckoning that
you'll not live enough to forget.

309
00:41:34,604 --> 00:41:38,131
-There's a thing you need to learn.
-What 's that?

310
00:41:38,341 --> 00:41:42,573
The only thing you can assume
about a broken-down old man...

311
00:41:42,779 --> 00:41:45,179
is that he's a survivor.

312
00:41:47,617 --> 00:41:48,982
Jack.

313
00:41:56,559 --> 00:41:58,754
-You really think she was running?
-It doesn't matter.

314
00:41:59,162 --> 00:42:02,928
The way I see it, she crossed over
when she got off the elevator.

315
00:42:03,132 --> 00:42:06,829
If Mr. Chidduck wants us to resolve
this, we will, but from now on...

316
00:42:07,036 --> 00:42:12,770
our only concern is with the child.
The girl is a threat like the two men.

317
00:42:21,684 --> 00:42:27,088
<i>The subscriber is unavailable</i>
<i>or outside the coverage area</i>.

318
00:42:27,723 --> 00:42:31,318
-Shouldn't we be there with him?
-He's fine.

319
00:42:32,161 --> 00:42:36,120
-Aren't you guys a team?
-He'll be fine.

320
00:42:38,734 --> 00:42:43,171
-What if he doesn't come back?
-He always comes back.

321
00:42:45,241 --> 00:42:49,644
<i>-The subscriber is unavailable</i>....
-Fuck me!

322
00:42:49,879 --> 00:42:53,906
-Are you sure she's all right?
-I think so.

323
00:42:54,283 --> 00:42:56,308
And the baby?

324
00:42:57,286 --> 00:43:00,312
As far as I can tell, it 's fine.

325
00:43:01,324 --> 00:43:07,024
-And they had no idea?
-None. None until I told them.

326
00:43:07,864 --> 00:43:10,697
And I'm sure you didn't
mention your relationship.

327
00:43:10,900 --> 00:43:14,700
-Fuck you, Francesca! What was I...?
-Easy. Easy!

328
00:43:15,838 --> 00:43:19,706
Easy. What good
would that have done?

329
00:43:20,676 --> 00:43:25,306
-You did the right thing.
-Didn't lose his place at the table.

330
00:43:29,952 --> 00:43:33,513
Francesca. Allen.

331
00:43:34,490 --> 00:43:36,185
Allen.

332
00:43:37,560 --> 00:43:41,519
I didn't ask to come back here.
You asked me.

333
00:43:42,265 --> 00:43:46,998
I will not have her, of all people,
telling me what is....

334
00:43:47,203 --> 00:43:49,831
For God's sake! She's not herself.

335
00:43:50,039 --> 00:43:54,339
More today than most, I'd say.
If Mom could see that cunt....

336
00:44:03,119 --> 00:44:04,746
Are you going to pay?

337
00:44:11,093 --> 00:44:12,993
I'm going to the police.

338
00:44:17,533 --> 00:44:21,526
You're here out of a basic need.

339
00:44:21,737 --> 00:44:26,299
You needed money from me.
I needed discretion from you!

340
00:44:26,509 --> 00:44:28,807
Loyalty! Obedience!

341
00:44:29,011 --> 00:44:33,243
You are here, frankly, because
after what happened in Baltimore...

342
00:44:33,449 --> 00:44:39,354
you were for sale! And you
will do as you are told!

343
00:44:40,423 --> 00:44:42,891
-What about Robin?
-What about her?

344
00:44:53,703 --> 00:44:57,332
-The woman needs to be reassessed.
-What does that mean?

345
00:44:57,540 --> 00:45:00,168
-She ran, Doc.
-She panicked.

346
00:45:00,376 --> 00:45:02,401
-What happened to your eye?
-Where's Sarno?

347
00:45:02,612 --> 00:45:04,978
Sarno came and went.
We thought he'd be with you.

348
00:45:08,117 --> 00:45:10,017
Hold there just a bit.

349
00:45:11,587 --> 00:45:13,418
Sit down.

350
00:45:30,339 --> 00:45:32,830
Move your fucking hand.

351
00:45:41,217 --> 00:45:42,912
Hello?

352
00:45:43,152 --> 00:45:46,815
<i>-Are you the client?</i>
-I am the client.

353
00:45:47,023 --> 00:45:50,982
Tell the doctor to get to Highway
19 South, across the border.

354
00:45:51,193 --> 00:45:56,756
He'll come to a town, Salsipuedes.
He'll find the Nacio Madre Motel.

355
00:45:56,966 --> 00:46:00,231
Across from it there's
a payphone where he'll wait.

356
00:46:00,836 --> 00:46:04,670
He comes ready to induce labor
and leave with the baby.

357
00:46:05,007 --> 00:46:07,771
<i>We let the girl go when</i>
<i>we feel safe</i>.

358
00:46:10,146 --> 00:46:14,913
He comes alone.
He brings 15 million dollars.

359
00:46:17,620 --> 00:46:20,214
15 million dollars?

360
00:46:22,658 --> 00:46:26,822
We're going to need some time to
get that. Give me 24 hours.

361
00:46:29,765 --> 00:46:33,394
-You got 12.
<i>-Goddamit!</i>

362
00:46:33,936 --> 00:46:35,665
12 fucking hours!

363
00:46:36,038 --> 00:46:38,404
Jesus Christ!
How do you expect me to....

364
00:46:39,575 --> 00:46:44,808
Okay. All right, fine.
12 hours. Jesus!

365
00:46:46,148 --> 00:46:48,275
Is that it?

366
00:47:04,967 --> 00:47:08,835
Yeah, small, unmarked bills.

367
00:47:09,038 --> 00:47:14,840
You know how much that weighs?
Try a couple thousand pounds!

368
00:47:16,746 --> 00:47:19,044
All right, fine. Hundreds.

369
00:47:20,750 --> 00:47:22,615
-Is that it?
<i>-What do you think?</i>

370
00:47:23,119 --> 00:47:26,418
<i>-It has holes</i>.
-Well, we're new at this.

371
00:47:27,456 --> 00:47:29,754
You're not gonna make it, kid.

372
00:47:37,867 --> 00:47:40,927
One's bad fire. Three's gunplay.

373
00:47:43,172 --> 00:47:45,003
Step out.

374
00:47:56,485 --> 00:48:00,012
Put it down. A cop'll come by,
blow your head off.

375
00:48:00,256 --> 00:48:02,656
Hands on your chest.

376
00:48:04,894 --> 00:48:08,796
-Who are you?
-Well, son...

377
00:48:09,632 --> 00:48:12,100
right now, I'm the button man.

378
00:48:12,835 --> 00:48:18,467
I'm the guy you'll wake up to,
one night, maybe a year from now...

379
00:48:19,141 --> 00:48:21,473
maybe two.

380
00:48:23,012 --> 00:48:26,971
And all you'll see is a pillow over
your face, then you'll hear a pop.

381
00:48:27,950 --> 00:48:30,544
Plenty more where I came from.

382
00:48:36,792 --> 00:48:38,191
Yeah, I used to be one.

383
00:48:39,929 --> 00:48:42,864
-What 's happening?
-Looks like a bagman.

384
00:48:43,065 --> 00:48:48,662
-He'll make an offer. Small.
-You should take it, maybe.

385
00:48:48,938 --> 00:48:51,930
No, you can't trust a bagman.
Always double-cross you.

386
00:48:53,476 --> 00:48:57,503
Tell you what I'm willing to do.
I'll take you to the man right now.

387
00:49:01,083 --> 00:49:07,352
He'll hand you a million, you wait
while your partner sends the girl.

388
00:49:07,756 --> 00:49:11,214
-When she gets there, you'll go.
-Sounds shaky.

389
00:49:14,196 --> 00:49:16,824
It 's better than the alternative,
I can promise you that.

390
00:49:18,200 --> 00:49:23,661
You want to wait here? Look what
happened when you stopped for gas.

391
00:49:25,007 --> 00:49:30,377
We just want to do this clean and
quiet. Take the girl, the baby back.

392
00:49:31,780 --> 00:49:34,214
I'll buy you a cup of coffee.

393
00:50:06,348 --> 00:50:09,044
Can we have a couple
of cups of coffee, please?

394
00:50:13,322 --> 00:50:17,884
So, are you the brains
of the outfit, or is he?

395
00:50:18,961 --> 00:50:22,692
Tell you the truth, I don't think
this is a brains kind of operation.

396
00:50:25,067 --> 00:50:27,763
Do you think I agreed to help you
because of Baltimore?

397
00:50:27,970 --> 00:50:31,064
I know that before
Baltimore you hadn't....

398
00:50:31,340 --> 00:50:35,401
I honestly hoped that if you eased
back into delivery, just....

399
00:50:35,611 --> 00:50:40,708
Don't be an idiot. No one incident
makes anyone what they are.

400
00:50:42,017 --> 00:50:44,178
Baltimore simply
taught me who I am.

401
00:50:44,653 --> 00:50:46,780
As for what I am...

402
00:50:47,523 --> 00:50:51,152
I learned all about the value
of human life from you.

403
00:50:51,694 --> 00:50:55,221
That certainty is more
important than morality.

404
00:50:57,299 --> 00:51:00,826
-Abortion is more certain than...?
-Exactly.

405
00:51:01,904 --> 00:51:06,034
I don't make mistakes.
I correct them.

406
00:51:07,042 --> 00:51:10,808
So I empathize with you,
Dad. I really do.

407
00:51:21,724 --> 00:51:23,851
Francesca.

408
00:51:27,930 --> 00:51:29,420
Fascinating, isn't it?

409
00:51:33,168 --> 00:51:35,466
I had no idea.

410
00:51:38,107 --> 00:51:41,270
-It 's really got me excited.
-Excited, huh?

411
00:51:42,745 --> 00:51:44,679
I missed you.

412
00:51:51,253 --> 00:51:55,781
They'll kill us.
The people I'm in business with.

413
00:51:56,025 --> 00:52:01,327
The money I have leads back
to them. We pay, they kill us.

414
00:52:02,965 --> 00:52:08,198
-Any police, they kill us.
-It 's your bed to lie in, not mine.

415
00:52:15,711 --> 00:52:18,305
You're my son.

416
00:52:18,647 --> 00:52:20,945
I love you.

417
00:52:22,685 --> 00:52:25,347
And it 's your bed too.

418
00:52:26,121 --> 00:52:29,090
That 's the sort
of people they are.

419
00:52:37,099 --> 00:52:39,431
I'm sorry.

420
00:52:42,137 --> 00:52:46,301
I'm sorry I've gotten you involved
in this part of my life.

421
00:52:46,542 --> 00:52:49,875
I know it isn't your thinking,
and I'm grateful for that.

422
00:52:50,079 --> 00:52:52,240
I never wanted you
to be that way.

423
00:52:52,448 --> 00:52:56,111
But don't be naïve. She understood
who she was dealing with.

424
00:52:56,318 --> 00:53:00,550
She understood the situation.
It 's a simple fact of life...

425
00:53:00,756 --> 00:53:05,625
that anyone who would do business
with a man like me can't be trusted.

426
00:53:05,828 --> 00:53:11,164
I'm a mother. My child is waiting
to come into this world.

427
00:53:12,901 --> 00:53:18,498
And suddenly, for the first time,
I feel like... that he deserves me.

428
00:53:19,641 --> 00:53:23,805
I don't mean that I've earned him
as a mother that 's carried has...

429
00:53:24,012 --> 00:53:29,211
but I worked hard to become the
kind of woman who could have one...

430
00:53:29,418 --> 00:53:32,945
naturally, with you.

431
00:53:37,493 --> 00:53:41,429
-You know the baby is, don't you?
-Of course I do.

432
00:53:42,231 --> 00:53:44,825
You know we have to go get him.

433
00:53:46,335 --> 00:53:48,633
I understand.

434
00:54:09,057 --> 00:54:11,491
If the girl should die...

435
00:54:11,760 --> 00:54:16,390
God forbid anything should happen,
but if there's any complications...

436
00:54:17,299 --> 00:54:23,067
we'll take care of it, understand?
You just bring me back my baby.

437
00:54:25,808 --> 00:54:31,110
I watch them pile up. Nightstick,
flashlight, bulletproof vest.

438
00:54:31,313 --> 00:54:33,247
Fucking utility belts, right?

439
00:54:33,448 --> 00:54:36,508
Fucking sign on his head
reading: "Why bother?"

440
00:54:36,852 --> 00:54:41,050
-They say shit like "ascertain".
-"Surveillance".

441
00:54:41,256 --> 00:54:44,248
-"Affirmative".
-"I need backup."

442
00:54:44,459 --> 00:54:46,586
"Adjudicate".

443
00:54:47,496 --> 00:54:49,657
-"Adjudicate"?
-Yeah.

444
00:54:50,899 --> 00:54:54,960
But, you know,
you got the other side.

445
00:54:55,170 --> 00:55:00,107
Trigger-happy cocksuckers all about
the shooting and the posturing.

446
00:55:00,375 --> 00:55:04,709
-"You don't know me, I did time."
-Because you got caught, dumbfuck.

447
00:55:04,913 --> 00:55:07,973
These days, they want to be
criminals more than commit crimes.

448
00:55:09,351 --> 00:55:13,185
That 's not just crime,
that 's the way of the world.

449
00:55:16,391 --> 00:55:18,484
What?

450
00:55:19,428 --> 00:55:21,862
I'm just talking here.

451
00:55:22,231 --> 00:55:25,997
By their design, all we only need
to come back with is the baby.

452
00:55:26,201 --> 00:55:30,262
Think about it. No money,
no perps, no nothing.

453
00:55:30,806 --> 00:55:33,468
We could kill these two fucks, keep
the money, bring Chidduck's baby...

454
00:55:33,675 --> 00:55:36,109
and say it all went well.

455
00:55:36,678 --> 00:55:40,341
Well, mostly well.

456
00:55:40,549 --> 00:55:42,244
What, the girl?

457
00:55:42,451 --> 00:55:47,616
It 'll be assumed she ate a bullet
and they made off to Bolivia.

458
00:55:48,590 --> 00:55:53,789
Dammit. It doesn't work. The Doc.

459
00:55:56,365 --> 00:55:59,357
-The Doctor gets shot in the fray.
-Right.

460
00:55:59,701 --> 00:56:04,502
We tried to help him,
but it was either him or the baby.

461
00:56:04,706 --> 00:56:09,871
He was alive when we took off.
He must have died in the desert.

462
00:56:10,913 --> 00:56:14,280
-Creative articulation, my man.
-I'm just talking, of course.

463
00:56:14,483 --> 00:56:16,610
Sure.

464
00:56:16,818 --> 00:56:21,414
So, what we need is a nice,
quiet place to have a baby.

465
00:56:23,258 --> 00:56:28,662
As I said before, my only
concern is for the child.

466
00:56:37,606 --> 00:56:39,699
Hola, Vivian.

467
00:56:40,375 --> 00:56:43,970
This is Jeffers. I need to speak
to the Question Mark.

468
00:56:44,179 --> 00:56:46,647
We might be needing
a room later on tonight.

469
00:57:01,263 --> 00:57:03,231
You know...

470
00:57:03,699 --> 00:57:08,398
you seem like a good guy. You ought
to get out of this fucking business.

471
00:57:08,603 --> 00:57:10,764
What would I do, then?

472
00:57:11,306 --> 00:57:15,174
You get to be my age,
you start feeling a little different.

473
00:57:15,544 --> 00:57:19,275
You realize one day you'll zig.
All that time, you're thinking...

474
00:57:19,481 --> 00:57:25,044
you'll put something away tomorrow,
then one day you're out of lives.

475
00:57:27,956 --> 00:57:30,720
Do you got some money put away?

476
00:57:32,060 --> 00:57:34,790
I've got a daughter. She's...

477
00:57:35,697 --> 00:57:40,657
she's putting something together,
says she'll take care of me, but....

478
00:57:41,069 --> 00:57:43,503
Not working out?

479
00:57:43,905 --> 00:57:47,397
Something like that.
Yeah, something like that.

480
00:57:55,584 --> 00:57:59,350
You're sure you don't want to take
a ride with me? Million in cash?

481
00:58:10,699 --> 00:58:14,829
I wish I could, but....

482
00:58:16,171 --> 00:58:19,766
-I'm a bagman.
-You are a bagman.

483
00:58:26,815 --> 00:58:29,306
Until that day, then.

484
00:58:48,136 --> 00:58:50,434
What do you think?

485
00:58:50,806 --> 00:58:54,503
We can get her out of there
right now. Just two, right?

486
00:58:54,709 --> 00:58:59,169
Please, I have to take a ride back.
Don't do a thing without me.

487
00:58:59,381 --> 00:59:02,509
-No matter what.
-Jesus Christ, she's....

488
00:59:02,717 --> 00:59:07,450
All right? I'm counting on you to
remain pitiless here. Help me out.

489
00:59:07,656 --> 00:59:11,854
Just stay with her and
let it play out. I'll be back.

490
00:59:15,263 --> 00:59:20,633
-Wait a minute, what 's so funny?
-You're cheating!

491
00:59:20,836 --> 00:59:23,999
No, I'm not cheating, all right?

492
01:00:01,205 --> 01:00:02,866
What?

493
01:00:36,773 --> 01:00:39,742
-What are we playing?
-Hearts.

494
01:00:41,879 --> 01:00:43,938
How do you play?

495
01:00:44,148 --> 01:00:50,109
The object is to play the safest
game and finish with less points.

496
01:00:50,320 --> 01:00:54,222
A heart is the only thing
of value. If you have one...

497
01:00:54,458 --> 01:00:56,221
get rid of it.

498
01:00:56,426 --> 01:00:58,451
We start with the two of clubs.

499
01:00:59,263 --> 01:01:01,026
You need to throw down a club.

500
01:01:01,231 --> 01:01:03,791
If I don't have one,
then you can throw a heart.

501
01:01:05,936 --> 01:01:08,871
You can't lead with a heart unless
you have nothing else to throw.

502
01:01:09,373 --> 01:01:11,773
Or someone breaks the suit.
You follow?

503
01:01:14,311 --> 01:01:16,905
Couple of rounds
and she'll get it.

504
01:01:18,949 --> 01:01:22,214
See, you had the high card,
so you take the trick.

505
01:01:26,657 --> 01:01:28,522
Now you lead.

506
01:01:31,795 --> 01:01:33,660
First trick always
takes the odd card.

507
01:01:34,331 --> 01:01:37,789
Shit. You got the bitch.
She's 13 points.

508
01:01:38,035 --> 01:01:40,663
Fuck the bitch.
Just get rid of your hearts.

509
01:01:40,871 --> 01:01:43,271
Or shoot the moon. That 's when
you finish with everything.

510
01:01:43,473 --> 01:01:47,705
You got the hearts and the queen
of spades. Everyone else loses.

511
01:01:48,145 --> 01:01:49,510
Next to impossible.

512
01:01:49,880 --> 01:01:53,941
If someone figures it out, they can
sacrifice and hold onto a heart.

513
01:01:54,952 --> 01:01:56,749
And then you lose.

514
01:02:00,390 --> 01:02:02,620
Is that so?

515
01:02:26,583 --> 01:02:29,245
I needed the money.

516
01:02:34,291 --> 01:02:38,990
It 's a million dollars cash,
and I needed it for....

517
01:02:42,466 --> 01:02:44,991
That 's what it was about!

518
01:02:45,202 --> 01:02:48,103
I told myself that the Chidducks,
they'd be good, you know?

519
01:02:48,305 --> 01:02:51,900
And that the baby would
have a good life.

520
01:02:52,175 --> 01:02:55,975
I thought it through a thousand
times! I thought I could do it!

521
01:02:56,179 --> 01:02:58,545
I was certain, and it was...

522
01:02:59,049 --> 01:03:02,917
it was what was best
for everyone involved.

523
01:03:03,120 --> 01:03:07,648
For the baby, for the
Chidducks, for myself...

524
01:03:11,194 --> 01:03:12,661
the baby....

525
01:03:16,300 --> 01:03:21,033
Then I felt it move, and...

526
01:03:22,939 --> 01:03:24,770
I saw his little hands.

527
01:03:34,751 --> 01:03:36,776
The baby is mine.

528
01:03:40,490 --> 01:03:43,118
Okay, I'm sorry, but by yours,
do you mean that...?

529
01:03:43,327 --> 01:03:46,524
I mean that the Chidduck's
embryo didn't take...

530
01:03:46,730 --> 01:03:50,461
and this is my son
that I'm carrying.

531
01:03:57,874 --> 01:04:02,140
So that means that you
and Mr. Chidduck....

532
01:04:05,048 --> 01:04:07,073
Dr. Painter.

533
01:04:07,884 --> 01:04:11,843
-That sneaky little quack.
-It wasn't his idea, it was mine.

534
01:04:12,055 --> 01:04:15,513
I made it happen because
I needed the money.

535
01:04:16,760 --> 01:04:19,160
I made it happen.

536
01:04:47,791 --> 01:04:52,285
Listen, you don't want guys like
him or me touching you belly.

537
01:04:53,063 --> 01:04:55,224
Please.

538
01:04:59,002 --> 01:05:00,469
That 's creepy.

539
01:05:04,708 --> 01:05:07,006
We'll meet just right
past the border.

540
01:05:07,210 --> 01:05:10,145
Listen, I appreciate it.
Thanks a lot.

541
01:05:14,985 --> 01:05:17,749
Did you enjoy your coffee?

542
01:05:19,890 --> 01:05:23,053
I deal in counter-offers
and adjudication.

543
01:05:23,727 --> 01:05:26,355
You do your job, Mr.
Bullet-Catcher, and I'll do mine.

544
01:05:26,563 --> 01:05:28,793
I'm curious as to why
they didn't kill you.

545
01:05:30,567 --> 01:05:33,297
Maybe I didn't
present a real threat.

546
01:05:33,503 --> 01:05:36,336
Not like you fuckheads, shooting at
who agreed not to commit a crime.

547
01:05:36,540 --> 01:05:38,030
All right, come on.

548
01:05:38,241 --> 01:05:40,209
-The money coming?
-In a while.

549
01:05:40,410 --> 01:05:44,471
Then I suggest Dr. Painter
goes in now with 5O grand.

550
01:05:44,681 --> 01:05:48,378
Might calm their nerves if they
feel the real money's getting close.

551
01:05:48,585 --> 01:05:52,146
When you go out, I'll go in.

552
01:05:52,355 --> 01:05:56,792
-And adjudicate?
-If it comes to that, yes.

553
01:05:56,993 --> 01:06:00,827
-You go in by yourself?
-I think I can handle it.

554
01:06:01,031 --> 01:06:03,898
And you, cuff links...

555
01:06:04,100 --> 01:06:07,035
stay and watch over Mr. Chidduck
in case there's a contingent.

556
01:06:07,237 --> 01:06:10,001
-In case there's a what?
-A third man. A button.

557
01:06:10,340 --> 01:06:13,309
Something, anything that
we hadn't thought of.

558
01:06:13,510 --> 01:06:15,774
It 's called CYA,
you fucking moron.

559
01:06:16,112 --> 01:06:18,046
"Cover Your Ass".

560
01:06:19,416 --> 01:06:24,649
As collector of pre-war cop jargon,
I find the old man refreshing.

561
01:06:24,855 --> 01:06:29,019
Nevertheless, he's one against two
who killed two of my four.

562
01:06:29,226 --> 01:06:32,093
I suggest you let him C your A.

563
01:06:37,067 --> 01:06:39,831
What seems to be the problem here?

564
01:06:40,036 --> 01:06:44,302
The decision's been made. The Doc
goes in with the money alone.

565
01:06:44,741 --> 01:06:47,642
He follows the demands to
the letter and delivers the child.

566
01:06:47,911 --> 01:06:50,607
-We keep our distance.
-Unless there's a complication.

567
01:06:50,814 --> 01:06:53,044
Our only concern is
for the lives at stake.

568
01:06:53,250 --> 01:06:55,980
-Hale, you're not seriously...?
-I'm in a tight corner, Joe.

569
01:06:56,186 --> 01:07:01,249
It 's pure geometry, Mr. Sarno.
We've been head-to-head with them.

570
01:07:01,458 --> 01:07:06,418
One old man all alone out there...
no one'll come out alive.

571
01:07:07,998 --> 01:07:13,334
To be honest, Joe,
that 's not what this is about.

572
01:07:13,803 --> 01:07:16,271
You're conflicted here.

573
01:07:16,473 --> 01:07:20,273
Your job's been to protect me,
my associates and my money.

574
01:07:20,644 --> 01:07:25,104
But I no longer care about any
of that. This is about my child.

575
01:07:25,315 --> 01:07:29,979
And that in itself presents its
own special conflict, doesn't it?

576
01:07:30,754 --> 01:07:34,815
Emotional detachment, Joe.
For what it 's worth...

577
01:07:35,358 --> 01:07:39,055
I think these two
pretty much define it.

578
01:07:41,565 --> 01:07:43,226
Are you up to this?

579
01:07:46,536 --> 01:07:49,300
-I'll do whatever has to be done.
-All right.

580
01:07:49,506 --> 01:07:51,440
Jeffers and Obecks
will follow you...

581
01:07:51,641 --> 01:07:54,269
and see that you come out
safely with the baby.

582
01:07:54,477 --> 01:07:57,002
Sarno handles the money.

583
01:08:00,650 --> 01:08:02,982
Sorry, gentlemen.
I'm not trusting any of you.

584
01:08:03,453 --> 01:08:06,251
I'm afraid I want to eat
my cake and have it too.

585
01:08:19,235 --> 01:08:22,398
<i>-The subscriber is unavailable</i>....
-Shit.

586
01:08:25,342 --> 01:08:28,175
-You talked about killing her.
-No one said "kill".

587
01:08:28,378 --> 01:08:30,812
They said "adjudicate",
and that can mean a lot of things.

588
01:08:31,014 --> 01:08:34,472
There's a lot more going on in
that room than you were seeing.

589
01:08:37,587 --> 01:08:41,523
What I heard was you're ready
to risk a woman's life for money.

590
01:08:43,493 --> 01:08:48,089
Not money. 15 million dollars.

591
01:08:48,298 --> 01:08:52,200
Money is what you take
to the grocery store...

592
01:08:52,402 --> 01:08:54,529
is what you get out of an ATM.

593
01:08:54,738 --> 01:08:57,172
15 million dollars is not money.

594
01:08:57,374 --> 01:09:00,673
It 's a motive with a
universal adaptor on it.

595
01:09:00,910 --> 01:09:05,347
-You don't think that those two...?
-No, never. Never think.

596
01:09:05,548 --> 01:09:09,143
Thinking's how you lost your nerve
in the first place, Dr. Painter.

597
01:09:11,121 --> 01:09:13,282
You think I don't know you?

598
01:09:13,490 --> 01:09:17,950
You think your father and I
have secrets from each other?

599
01:09:18,461 --> 01:09:22,329
I know about your residency,
your so-called hiatus.

600
01:09:22,532 --> 01:09:25,365
I know about that bad piece
of luck you had in Baltimore.

601
01:09:25,568 --> 01:09:27,729
-I didn't lose my....
-I know...

602
01:09:27,937 --> 01:09:31,998
you weren't expected to deliver
this kid. I know you can't.

603
01:09:32,208 --> 01:09:35,075
I know your skull is splitting
down the middle...

604
01:09:35,278 --> 01:09:37,769
because you think this thing
is gonna play out...

605
01:09:37,981 --> 01:09:40,575
and you're going to have to
deliver this baby into the world.

606
01:09:40,784 --> 01:09:45,448
Well, what happened in
Baltimore will not happen here.

607
01:09:46,056 --> 01:09:50,083
You understand?
Because I won't let it.

608
01:09:58,735 --> 01:10:00,896
So...

609
01:10:03,940 --> 01:10:07,103
don't think, Dr. Painter, just do.

610
01:10:08,011 --> 01:10:12,573
And whatever you do,
don't tell them what I know.

611
01:10:13,950 --> 01:10:17,681
Keep your mouth shut and
everything will be just fine.

612
01:10:18,321 --> 01:10:20,482
Just fine.

613
01:10:25,161 --> 01:10:28,187
Dumping Sarno is going
to be tough to explain.

614
01:10:29,365 --> 01:10:31,663
Tougher still to do.

615
01:10:32,235 --> 01:10:35,033
I ain't buying
that survivor bullshit.

616
01:10:36,439 --> 01:10:39,966
He'll drop from a skull shot
like any other man.

617
01:10:40,210 --> 01:10:44,010
We just take him out before he goes
in. Bring the money in ourselves.

618
01:10:44,214 --> 01:10:47,308
After that, it 's our word
against the desert 's.

619
01:10:47,617 --> 01:10:50,484
Creative articulation, baby.

620
01:10:54,357 --> 01:10:56,484
What is it?

621
01:10:56,760 --> 01:10:59,991
Something in there between
Sarno and Chidduck.

622
01:11:00,196 --> 01:11:02,687
It ain't clear and
it 's chapping my ass.

623
01:11:03,099 --> 01:11:06,694
-What was that shit about conflict?
-He said, this is about my child...

624
01:11:06,903 --> 01:11:09,667
this is a special conflict.

625
01:11:11,441 --> 01:11:15,707
Why would saving
somebody else's child...

626
01:11:15,912 --> 01:11:19,609
would be a conflict
to anyone? Unless...

627
01:11:20,083 --> 01:11:23,746
-The girl.
-Sarno.

628
01:11:28,191 --> 01:11:30,284
All set, Doc?

629
01:12:12,368 --> 01:12:15,166
I was up on this robbery bit...

630
01:12:15,371 --> 01:12:17,498
with a public defender.

631
01:12:17,707 --> 01:12:21,108
I was looking at my
first long stretch.

632
01:12:21,311 --> 01:12:24,712
Out of nowhere, this uptown lawyer
comes and says he'll get me off.

633
01:12:25,615 --> 01:12:28,482
He says he'll do it for free,
I just gotta do a favor in return.

634
01:12:31,221 --> 01:12:35,555
Then he tells me about this
teacher who's molesting his son.

635
01:12:37,393 --> 01:12:40,590
I went up alone.
Didn't make a sound.

636
01:12:40,797 --> 01:12:45,359
There was nice carpet on the stairs
and a light busted in the hall.

637
01:12:46,402 --> 01:12:48,768
The door was open, man.

638
01:12:49,906 --> 01:12:52,306
It was like it was meant to be.

639
01:12:53,076 --> 01:12:57,706
And I slipped in and I found him
in the bedroom, naked.

640
01:12:57,914 --> 01:12:59,711
With all these pictures on the bed.

641
01:13:03,286 --> 01:13:08,883
Man, that lawyer was right.
He was more than right.

642
01:13:11,194 --> 01:13:15,722
Then he turned around, and I
didn't hit him. I just said:

643
01:13:17,066 --> 01:13:20,763
"Lay on the bed face down."

644
01:13:20,970 --> 01:13:22,938
And he did.

645
01:13:24,674 --> 01:13:28,201
I was savoring it.

646
01:13:28,711 --> 01:13:32,408
I mean, really,
really enjoying it...

647
01:13:32,615 --> 01:13:36,949
thinking I would take a Polaroid of
this and send it to that lawyer...

648
01:13:37,153 --> 01:13:42,056
so he could sleep better at night.
Maybe one for myself, so I could....

649
01:13:47,430 --> 01:13:50,297
And then I heard him pray.

650
01:13:52,468 --> 01:13:56,802
"Now I lay me down to sleep,
I pray You, Lord, my soul to keep."

651
01:13:57,240 --> 01:14:00,209
And you know something?
It stayed with me.

652
01:14:00,410 --> 01:14:02,344
It bothered me.

653
01:14:02,545 --> 01:14:05,605
Of all the people I'd done it to,
that had to be the one I felt.

654
01:14:05,815 --> 01:14:10,514
And to this day, I can't go
to sleep unless I say that prayer.

655
01:14:13,523 --> 01:14:16,788
You wanna get out now?
You wanna quit?

656
01:14:17,327 --> 01:14:19,693
This is never gonna
come your way again.

657
01:14:19,896 --> 01:14:22,763
What if your day comes and
you're face down, waiting?

658
01:14:22,966 --> 01:14:27,096
And what if in that final second of
life you start to believe in God?

659
01:14:27,670 --> 01:14:30,070
What are you gonna
have to give Him?

660
01:14:31,107 --> 01:14:34,372
What will you say in your defense?

661
01:14:34,911 --> 01:14:38,608
What does it matter we take
a child away from his mother?

662
01:14:39,582 --> 01:14:43,541
After all the people we've robbed
and maimed and murdered...

663
01:14:43,920 --> 01:14:46,855
you think it matters?

664
01:14:47,056 --> 01:14:49,286
It matters.

665
01:14:50,126 --> 01:14:52,424
Believe me, it matters.

666
01:15:10,179 --> 01:15:11,908
Want to leave her a note?

667
01:15:21,290 --> 01:15:24,487
No, you know, I think
it 's better if we just leave.

668
01:15:26,062 --> 01:15:30,226
-We can't leave her alone like that.
-There's some guy hiding.

669
01:15:30,433 --> 01:15:33,561
-He'll get her when we're gone.
-All right.

670
01:15:39,942 --> 01:15:42,308
I left my jacket in there.

671
01:15:46,215 --> 01:15:48,445
I'll get it.

672
01:16:15,211 --> 01:16:17,679
You know what I'm gonna
tell God when I see Him?

673
01:16:18,748 --> 01:16:21,581
I'm gonna tell him I was framed.

674
01:16:21,784 --> 01:16:24,719
I'm at the Nacio Madre Hotel.
There's been a shooting.

675
01:16:36,999 --> 01:16:40,059
-A woman in your condition...
-The police are on their way!

676
01:16:40,269 --> 01:16:43,397
You can come in shooting! At least
I'll be taking one of you with us!

677
01:16:43,940 --> 01:16:47,239
Just get in your fucking car
and move on!

678
01:16:47,543 --> 01:16:50,239
I got all night long!
I'm not moving!

679
01:16:50,580 --> 01:16:52,639
Test me!

680
01:16:53,516 --> 01:16:55,347
Peek-a-boo.

681
01:17:02,158 --> 01:17:04,854
Is that baby hungry yet, Robin?

682
01:17:05,895 --> 01:17:09,058
-Whose money is it?
-The worst.

683
01:17:10,666 --> 01:17:14,534
-Do you believe in karma, Joe?
-Karma?

684
01:17:17,140 --> 01:17:20,541
Karma is only justice
without the satisfaction.

685
01:17:20,943 --> 01:17:23,503
I don't believe in justice.

686
01:17:25,414 --> 01:17:28,110
Well, tonight I certainly
hope you're right.

687
01:18:51,234 --> 01:18:53,862
Fucking useless.

688
01:19:55,064 --> 01:19:57,862
<i>-What's your location?</i>
-We arrived at the motel.

689
01:20:12,515 --> 01:20:14,676
Help me.

690
01:20:25,661 --> 01:20:27,891
Captain...

691
01:20:29,365 --> 01:20:32,129
it 's all under control. Thanks.

692
01:20:33,669 --> 01:20:35,728
It 's okay.

693
01:20:36,272 --> 01:20:38,467
It 's all under control. Thanks.

694
01:20:38,674 --> 01:20:41,268
-Robin, get in the car.
-It 's okay, understand?

695
01:20:42,244 --> 01:20:44,906
-Stay calm.
-Robin...

696
01:20:45,114 --> 01:20:48,106
-Excuse me, fella.
-Who are you?

697
01:20:48,317 --> 01:20:51,775
-Help me.
-Robin. Robin...

698
01:20:51,987 --> 01:20:54,717
Robin, get in the car.

699
01:20:55,191 --> 01:20:57,386
-Don't do it.
-Who the fuck are you?

700
01:20:57,593 --> 01:20:59,117
Who the fuck are you?

701
01:20:59,328 --> 01:21:02,058
-Let me see your hands.
-Mind your business. Robin...

702
01:21:02,264 --> 01:21:04,459
...come with me and get in the car.
-Easy, okay?

703
01:21:04,700 --> 01:21:08,158
-It 's over. Get in the car.
-Freeze.

704
01:21:08,971 --> 01:21:10,768
Easy, okay?.

705
01:21:11,207 --> 01:21:14,699
-Hands on the car.
-Put your hands on the car.

706
01:21:15,611 --> 01:21:18,808
-What are we doing?
-He wants our hands on the car.

707
01:21:21,484 --> 01:21:23,145
You too.

708
01:21:23,352 --> 01:21:25,786
-Me too?
-Hands on the car.

709
01:21:25,988 --> 01:21:29,321
-Are you for real?
-I've got reality here in my hand.

710
01:21:39,835 --> 01:21:42,770
-I found a gun.
-Lie down. Both of you.

711
01:21:43,105 --> 01:21:44,766
He wants us to get on the ground.

712
01:21:53,115 --> 01:21:56,243
Central, this is 44.
We need backup.

713
01:21:58,888 --> 01:22:00,822
Get up! Get up!

714
01:22:16,105 --> 01:22:17,663
She's going for the car, man.

715
01:22:21,577 --> 01:22:23,306
Robin, come, get in the car!

716
01:22:34,089 --> 01:22:35,181
Careful.

717
01:22:35,391 --> 01:22:37,586
If I want to hit her, I hit her.
If I want to miss, I miss.

718
01:22:37,793 --> 01:22:39,488
Come, get in the car right now!

719
01:22:42,832 --> 01:22:44,857
To the right, to the right!

720
01:23:02,485 --> 01:23:03,975
Come on.

721
01:23:49,765 --> 01:23:52,063
Why are they headed south?

722
01:24:19,929 --> 01:24:22,420
Where are we going?

723
01:24:22,631 --> 01:24:24,622
-Fuck!
-We have her! Just take us back.

724
01:24:24,833 --> 01:24:28,667
Those shots were coming from north.
I'm not driving through more of that.

725
01:24:28,971 --> 01:24:32,930
-Shouldn't we call Sarno?
-Yeah, I'm gonna call him all right.

726
01:24:33,175 --> 01:24:35,973
I've a place we can go
until it 's safe.

727
01:24:37,746 --> 01:24:39,304
Trust me.

728
01:24:45,521 --> 01:24:48,718
It 's okay. The worst
of it 's behind us.

729
01:24:53,929 --> 01:24:56,261
Promise me something.

730
01:24:56,465 --> 01:25:00,765
You promise me I'll see my baby
before he takes him back.

731
01:25:05,574 --> 01:25:07,337
I promise.

732
01:25:11,347 --> 01:25:13,747
Yeah, it 's me again. We're coming.

733
01:25:13,949 --> 01:25:16,213
Tell him to be ready.

734
01:25:34,169 --> 01:25:35,363
<i>It's me</i>.

735
01:25:35,571 --> 01:25:38,563
-Where have you been?
<i>-I've been trying to get a signal!</i>

736
01:25:38,774 --> 01:25:41,106
<i>A couple guys showed up</i>.

737
01:25:41,310 --> 01:25:45,576
It got pretty choppy.
One of them made off with her.

738
01:25:45,781 --> 01:25:48,272
<i>-They're headed south</i>.
-Is Robin all right?

739
01:25:48,484 --> 01:25:50,247
<i>Yeah</i>,<i>she seems okay</i>.

740
01:25:50,452 --> 01:25:53,910
You just keep heading south.
I'll talk to you in as best I can.

741
01:25:54,723 --> 01:25:56,452
Abner, listen...

742
01:25:56,659 --> 01:25:59,150
<i>I'm sorry I couldn't</i>
<i>put my hand to her</i>.

743
01:25:59,528 --> 01:26:01,257
I gotta go.

744
01:26:12,941 --> 01:26:17,071
I'll pull out your fingernails
and leave you to think about it.

745
01:26:17,479 --> 01:26:19,947
Later, I'll come back
and I'll slash your eyeballs.

746
01:26:21,383 --> 01:26:23,283
Whatever else I'll do
to you after that...

747
01:26:23,485 --> 01:26:27,979
I'll pour gasoline into your eyes
just to keep you from passing out.

748
01:26:29,425 --> 01:26:34,124
Bottom line is, I'll ask you a
question and I'll never ask again.

749
01:26:35,264 --> 01:26:37,824
Where did they take the girl?

750
01:26:39,535 --> 01:26:42,129
I don't know.

751
01:27:00,589 --> 01:27:02,750
God!

752
01:27:25,414 --> 01:27:27,678
Dear God!

753
01:27:35,324 --> 01:27:38,760
Please help me. Please!

754
01:27:39,461 --> 01:27:42,897
-What happened to you?
-I need to get to a hospital!

755
01:27:43,632 --> 01:27:45,600
Who did that to you?

756
01:27:46,935 --> 01:27:49,699
Why do you look so sad?

757
01:27:50,005 --> 01:27:52,599
Get out of here and
don't come back, girl.

758
01:27:53,008 --> 01:27:54,839
Stupid whore.

759
01:28:13,929 --> 01:28:15,419
Bitch!

760
01:28:48,297 --> 01:28:50,492
What is this?

761
01:28:51,466 --> 01:28:54,663
I've got a business to run,
for Christ 's sakes!

762
01:28:55,571 --> 01:28:57,505
I left her with the doctor.

763
01:28:59,341 --> 01:29:00,831
Where were you?

764
01:29:01,043 --> 01:29:03,773
I had to go to the....
What happened?

765
01:29:04,112 --> 01:29:07,047
-Please, help.
-Who took your IV out?

766
01:29:07,249 --> 01:29:09,308
-Let 's get it back in.
-I don't want it!

767
01:29:09,518 --> 01:29:11,748
Pregnant women walking around...

768
01:29:11,954 --> 01:29:13,888
bleeding and upsetting
my customers.

769
01:29:14,089 --> 01:29:16,023
You are getting paid a lot of money...

770
01:29:16,225 --> 01:29:19,524
and I cannot do this by myself. Don't
ever let her leave your sight again.

771
01:29:19,728 --> 01:29:23,755
If I don't put the IV back,
your labor's gonna stop, okay?

772
01:29:25,467 --> 01:29:29,164
-What 's the matter?
-It 's killing me. Something's wrong.

773
01:29:29,438 --> 01:29:31,372
I don't see any money.

774
01:29:32,274 --> 01:29:34,834
This is 5O. I will make a call.

775
01:29:35,043 --> 01:29:36,806
You will have double
that in another hour.

776
01:29:37,012 --> 01:29:39,242
-So make the phone call.
-It hurts.

777
01:29:39,681 --> 01:29:42,548
I need the fucking baby first. Will
you please help me tie her down?

778
01:29:42,918 --> 01:29:46,547
It won't come out.
It 's killing me.

779
01:29:48,657 --> 01:29:50,682
Oh my God.

780
01:29:54,596 --> 01:29:57,827
-Is she supposed to be bleeding?
-She's had an abruption.

781
01:29:58,400 --> 01:30:02,268
The placenta has separated from her
uterus. She's bleeding internally.

782
01:30:04,172 --> 01:30:06,197
It 's going to be okay.

783
01:30:07,142 --> 01:30:09,474
You're going to be okay.

784
01:30:09,978 --> 01:30:12,811
-Make it stop.
-Is the baby going to die?

785
01:30:15,851 --> 01:30:17,842
What? What is it?

786
01:30:18,053 --> 01:30:19,918
I have to give her a C-section.

787
01:30:20,489 --> 01:30:22,957
-Do it.
-A delivery is one thing!

788
01:30:23,158 --> 01:30:26,457
You're talking about major surgery!
I could kill her.

789
01:30:26,662 --> 01:30:28,357
I have to get her to
a hospital right away!

790
01:30:28,563 --> 01:30:31,555
My only concern right now
is for the child, Dr. Painter.

791
01:30:35,737 --> 01:30:37,898
You're going to do it.

792
01:30:39,775 --> 01:30:42,073
It 's our baby!

793
01:30:42,277 --> 01:30:45,041
Tell him it 's our baby
and he'll let us go!

794
01:30:45,247 --> 01:30:46,805
It 's not the Chidducks'!

795
01:30:47,015 --> 01:30:51,213
They can have another baby!
Just tell him it 's our baby!

796
01:30:51,787 --> 01:30:53,948
Is this true?

797
01:30:56,224 --> 01:30:58,556
Tell him!

798
01:31:08,804 --> 01:31:10,897
He'll let us go! Tell him!

799
01:31:14,576 --> 01:31:19,172
Are you comfortable, Robin? We're
going to take out your baby now.

800
01:32:23,211 --> 01:32:26,339
-What is that?
-It 's a spinal.

801
01:32:27,249 --> 01:32:31,913
Don't knock me out.
I have to see my baby, Allen.

802
01:32:32,120 --> 01:32:36,386
-I just want to see my baby.
-It 'll numb you from the waist down.

803
01:32:36,825 --> 01:32:39,487
Stay still.

804
01:32:45,367 --> 01:32:47,835
I'm gonna get a smoke.

805
01:33:27,476 --> 01:33:29,501
She's...

806
01:33:31,913 --> 01:33:35,371
she's up there with them.

807
01:33:36,585 --> 01:33:38,985
The doctor and the...

808
01:33:39,688 --> 01:33:42,384
colored fella.

809
01:33:46,795 --> 01:33:49,559
I'm sorry, Joe.

810
01:33:53,235 --> 01:33:54,930
No need to be sorry, Abner.

811
01:33:57,739 --> 01:34:00,264
I'm dying.

812
01:34:00,675 --> 01:34:03,439
We'll get somebody right away.

813
01:34:05,514 --> 01:34:10,975
It 's not like I'm
scared or anything.

814
01:34:11,820 --> 01:34:15,017
-Listen, Abner...
-I'm dying, Jack.

815
01:34:32,974 --> 01:34:35,909
Remember that time...

816
01:34:36,711 --> 01:34:41,045
that time that we....

817
01:34:45,187 --> 01:34:47,781
-Oh, jeez.
-What?

818
01:34:47,989 --> 01:34:50,890
I'm dying, Joe.

819
01:34:57,265 --> 01:34:59,028
I'm sorry, Abner.

820
01:35:02,938 --> 01:35:05,065
Joe...

821
01:35:06,608 --> 01:35:08,974
I'm right here.

822
01:35:13,815 --> 01:35:17,012
If it 's not too much trouble...

823
01:35:20,956 --> 01:35:24,687
I'd kinda like to be alone.

824
01:35:35,604 --> 01:35:38,095
Till that day, pal.

825
01:36:12,540 --> 01:36:14,872
For Christ 's sake, will you?

826
01:36:15,644 --> 01:36:18,112
I think there are some men
here to see you.

827
01:36:56,284 --> 01:36:58,275
Can I get some help in here?

828
01:38:13,528 --> 01:38:16,929
-Can you walk?
-I wanna get this cocksucker.

829
01:38:48,797 --> 01:38:51,664
-Oh, no.
-What is it, man?

830
01:38:55,637 --> 01:38:57,662
Bagmen.

831
01:38:59,908 --> 01:39:01,205
Let 's get the girl.

832
01:39:01,409 --> 01:39:03,434
-I wanna see my baby.
-You got it, Doc?

833
01:39:03,645 --> 01:39:05,272
Almost.

834
01:39:26,835 --> 01:39:29,099
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

835
01:39:29,737 --> 01:39:31,432
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

836
01:39:53,461 --> 01:39:55,861
Is my baby okay?

837
01:40:22,790 --> 01:40:24,758
My baby.

838
01:40:43,244 --> 01:40:45,576
How's the baby, Doc?

839
01:40:49,417 --> 01:40:51,783
What 's going on with the baby, Doc?

840
01:40:52,053 --> 01:40:54,044
Doc?

841
01:41:10,071 --> 01:41:13,302
-Get back in there, Doc.
-I'm sorry.

842
01:41:53,948 --> 01:41:56,212
You coming, man?

843
01:42:02,457 --> 01:42:04,084
Come on.

844
01:42:20,942 --> 01:42:22,876
My baby.

845
01:42:23,311 --> 01:42:26,712
Come on, brother. Let 's do this.

846
01:42:47,535 --> 01:42:50,197
She's had enough, man.

847
01:43:59,040 --> 01:44:01,372
Just relax now.

848
01:44:05,279 --> 01:44:07,611
Almost there.

849
01:44:26,334 --> 01:44:28,268
It 's under control.

850
01:44:31,572 --> 01:44:34,006
There's nothing you can do here.

851
01:44:39,547 --> 01:44:40,844
Get out.

852
01:45:20,755 --> 01:45:24,088
There's always free
cheese in a mousetrap.

853
01:45:52,186 --> 01:45:53,949
What do you think?

854
01:45:54,155 --> 01:45:57,318
I think a plan is just a list
of things that don't happen.

855
01:45:57,725 --> 01:45:59,886
If we die...

856
01:46:01,829 --> 01:46:04,024
we die alone.

857
01:47:28,816 --> 01:47:31,182
Are you all right?

858
01:47:32,486 --> 01:47:34,852
Yeah, I'm still here.

859
01:47:35,990 --> 01:47:39,118
-Are you still with me?
-I'm still here.

860
01:51:49,476 --> 01:51:51,376
Come on up.

861
01:53:04,218 --> 01:53:07,085
So, you're going to
let her keep the baby?

862
01:53:07,288 --> 01:53:09,153
It 's her baby.

863
01:53:09,556 --> 01:53:11,888
Her and the doctor.

864
01:53:13,661 --> 01:53:15,822
Is that true?

865
01:53:17,931 --> 01:53:20,297
What do you think?

866
01:53:27,207 --> 01:53:28,674
Come on.

867
01:53:28,876 --> 01:53:31,845
You can tell somebody's family
just by looking at them.

868
01:54:24,665 --> 01:54:26,462
Till that day, then.

869
01:54:27,735 --> 01:54:30,101
Till that day.

870
01:54:43,684 --> 01:54:46,084
What are you gonna tell God now?

871
01:54:56,764 --> 01:54:59,289
<i>We don't want your forgiveness</i>.

872
01:54:59,500 --> 01:55:01,525
<i>We won't make excuses</i>.

873
01:55:01,735 --> 01:55:05,034
<i>We're not gonna blame you</i>
<i>even if you are an accessory</i>.

874
01:55:05,239 --> 01:55:07,969
<i>But we will not accept</i>
<i>your natural order</i>.

875
01:55:08,175 --> 01:55:12,441
<i>We didn't come for absolution</i>.
<i>We didn't ask to be redeemed</i>.

876
01:55:12,646 --> 01:55:14,978
<i>But isn't that the way it is?</i>

877
01:55:15,182 --> 01:55:19,676
<i>Every goddamn time. Your prayers</i>
<i>are always answered</i>...

878
01:55:20,754 --> 01:55:23,484
<i>in the order they're received</i>.

879
01:55:28,395 --> 01:55:29,794
I'm pregnant.
