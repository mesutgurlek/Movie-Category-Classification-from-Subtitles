1
00:02:17,514 --> 00:02:19,474
Mother! Oh mother!!

2
00:02:19,474 --> 00:02:21,893
Hang on... Commander...

3
00:02:31,069 --> 00:02:32,570
Mother!

4
00:02:40,203 --> 00:02:42,122
It's a case of severe appendicitis.

5
00:02:42,789 --> 00:02:45,250
We need to operate immediately.

6
00:02:46,626 --> 00:02:49,212
He is the face of our movement.

7
00:02:50,046 --> 00:02:52,465
We cannot risk going to the hospital.

8
00:02:52,799 --> 00:02:55,135
We will have to
take the risk, Zahoor.

9
00:02:56,386 --> 00:02:58,972
Or tomorrow the press will report...

10
00:02:58,972 --> 00:03:00,682
that Commander lkhlaq Latif died...

11
00:03:00,682 --> 00:03:03,476
of a terrifying explosion
of his appendix.

12
00:03:05,895 --> 00:03:10,400
I'll arrange an ambulance and
will meet you by the lake in an hour.

13
00:03:11,025 --> 00:03:13,027
Where will you operate?

14
00:03:15,363 --> 00:03:16,531
At home.

15
00:03:43,308 --> 00:03:44,559
- "What is a home?"

16
00:03:44,893 --> 00:03:47,854
"lt is brothers and sisters..."
- And sisters.

17
00:03:48,521 --> 00:03:51,691
"And fathers and mothers."
- And mothers.

18
00:03:51,691 --> 00:03:57,363
"It is unselfish acts and kindly sharing."
- Sharing.

19
00:03:57,363 --> 00:04:01,409
"And showing your loved ones
you're always caring..."

20
00:04:01,409 --> 00:04:02,744
- Caring.

21
00:04:03,286 --> 00:04:05,163
"What is a house?"

22
00:04:13,296 --> 00:04:15,381
Doctor, how are you?
- I am fine.

23
00:04:15,673 --> 00:04:18,051
- You got delayed today...
- Another surgery.

24
00:04:18,509 --> 00:04:20,428
Let the doctor go...

25
00:04:39,864 --> 00:04:42,116
Lower the heat a bit...

26
00:04:46,913 --> 00:04:48,331
And the flames within you...

27
00:04:56,881 --> 00:04:58,967
They can burn this house down!

28
00:05:00,969 --> 00:05:04,889
You'll have the
village burnt to ashes.

29
00:05:07,850 --> 00:05:10,436
Doctor...
- Yes.

30
00:05:13,773 --> 00:05:15,984
Do you know what you're doing?

31
00:05:16,150 --> 00:05:18,987
Exactly what a doctor
should be doing.

32
00:05:22,365 --> 00:05:23,950
Which side are you on?

33
00:05:26,869 --> 00:05:29,205
I am for life.

34
00:06:42,487 --> 00:06:43,154
- Move.

35
00:06:52,246 --> 00:06:55,833
Salam Alaikum! This is Gul Khan.

36
00:06:55,833 --> 00:06:58,628
It's a cordon and search operation.

37
00:06:58,836 --> 00:07:05,176
Every man and boy is ordered to assemble
in the school grounds immediately.

38
00:07:05,718 --> 00:07:09,806
Women and children may stay home.

39
00:07:09,806 --> 00:07:12,767
It's a cordon and search operation.

40
00:07:13,226 --> 00:07:19,399
Every man and boy is ordered to assemble
in the school grounds immediately.

41
00:07:20,358 --> 00:07:23,528
Hilaal!
There's a crackdown in our village.

42
00:07:26,322 --> 00:07:32,120
Every man and boy is ordered to assemble
in the school grounds immediately.

43
00:07:43,297 --> 00:07:44,882
- This crackdown may go on all day...

44
00:07:45,591 --> 00:07:49,053
This before meals, this afterwards.

45
00:07:50,179 --> 00:07:52,432
If the pain gets worse, inject this.

46
00:08:18,499 --> 00:08:19,500
Be careful...

47
00:08:20,835 --> 00:08:23,379
If they suspect something...

48
00:08:23,629 --> 00:08:24,881
no one will survive.

49
00:08:25,214 --> 00:08:26,549
Neither you...

50
00:08:26,841 --> 00:08:28,009
nor I...

51
00:08:33,723 --> 00:08:35,016
And Haider?

52
00:08:40,855 --> 00:08:43,483
God is his guardian.

53
00:08:44,859 --> 00:08:47,403
He will take care of him...

54
00:09:56,889 --> 00:09:59,767
- Save me... Oh, Lord!

55
00:09:59,767 --> 00:10:01,352
- I don't know!!

56
00:10:53,195 --> 00:10:54,739
- Ikhlaq Latif...

57
00:10:55,781 --> 00:10:56,824
Surrender yourself...

58
00:11:00,077 --> 00:11:04,957
- Indian law will give you a fair trial.

59
00:11:10,838 --> 00:11:13,549
Lay down your weapons
and come out.

60
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:25,436
- You don't have a chance.

61
00:11:26,062 --> 00:11:27,396
Surrender or die.

62
00:12:26,288 --> 00:12:29,125
Sir... lkhlaq Latif is alive...

63
00:12:29,125 --> 00:12:30,626
We have killed the
other two millitants.

64
00:12:30,626 --> 00:12:32,169
Shall we send in reinforcements?

65
00:12:32,169 --> 00:12:34,964
No bloody militant
dead or alive...

66
00:12:36,090 --> 00:12:38,551
is worth my soldier's life...

67
00:12:40,344 --> 00:12:42,513
In the name of Allah
most merciful...

68
00:12:42,513 --> 00:12:44,014
- Load...

69
00:13:02,825 --> 00:13:03,784
Ready...

70
00:13:11,292 --> 00:13:12,042
Fire!

71
00:14:21,362 --> 00:14:25,032
Everybody line up outside
with your IDs and bags.

72
00:14:43,717 --> 00:14:44,677
Where are you going?

73
00:14:45,219 --> 00:14:46,136
Srinagar.

74
00:14:46,345 --> 00:14:48,514
You are coming from?
- Aligarh.

75
00:14:48,681 --> 00:14:49,974
What do you do there?

76
00:14:50,307 --> 00:14:51,517
I'm a student.

77
00:14:51,517 --> 00:14:52,518
College ID?

78
00:15:01,944 --> 00:15:03,487
Subject of research?

79
00:15:03,946 --> 00:15:06,824
Revolutionary poets of British India.

80
00:15:07,449 --> 00:15:09,201
Which town do you belong to?

81
00:15:11,871 --> 00:15:12,788
Islamabad.

82
00:15:16,959 --> 00:15:18,752
- The captain is out at the check post...

83
00:15:19,336 --> 00:15:20,880
Any message for him?

84
00:15:32,474 --> 00:15:33,517
Salam Alaikum!

85
00:15:43,485 --> 00:15:44,111
Come.

86
00:15:45,905 --> 00:15:48,157
- Sir, I want to interview you...

87
00:15:48,157 --> 00:15:49,533
Go ahead... interview me now...

88
00:15:49,742 --> 00:15:51,160
Ah, thanks!

89
00:15:51,410 --> 00:15:52,745
So...

90
00:16:06,634 --> 00:16:08,260
I'll thrash you!

91
00:16:08,802 --> 00:16:12,598
Your love for Kashmir...
is expressed as Islamabad?

92
00:16:12,806 --> 00:16:13,641
What?

93
00:16:14,224 --> 00:16:16,685
Sir, Islamabad is another name
for Anantnag.

94
00:16:16,852 --> 00:16:17,978
I know.

95
00:16:19,229 --> 00:16:22,816
But for us...
there's just one Islamabad.

96
00:16:23,317 --> 00:16:24,568
In Pakistan...

97
00:16:25,444 --> 00:16:27,488
Nice poems

98
00:16:27,738 --> 00:16:29,031
Rather difficult though.

99
00:16:29,698 --> 00:16:33,744
Be careful with such beautiful inspiration.

100
00:16:34,870 --> 00:16:36,205
Okay?
Take this.

101
00:16:38,916 --> 00:16:43,212
Haider, that burrito
wouldn't budge.

102
00:16:43,212 --> 00:16:45,965
I told him that you are a poet,
not a militant.

103
00:16:48,008 --> 00:16:49,927
And we are engaged to be married.

104
00:16:49,927 --> 00:16:51,178
He wanted proof.

105
00:16:51,845 --> 00:16:54,181
I told him to read your diary.

106
00:16:54,181 --> 00:16:56,058
You wrote your poems for me...

107
00:16:56,058 --> 00:16:57,184
since childhood.

108
00:17:01,230 --> 00:17:02,356
Where are we going?

109
00:17:02,773 --> 00:17:03,941
To see your mother.

110
00:17:04,274 --> 00:17:05,150
Where is she?

111
00:17:05,567 --> 00:17:07,027
At your uncle's.

112
00:17:07,945 --> 00:17:08,779
Stop the car.

113
00:17:15,828 --> 00:17:17,371
I have to go home.

114
00:17:23,669 --> 00:17:24,795
Haider...

115
00:17:27,673 --> 00:17:32,469
There isn't much of a home
left in what remains...

116
00:18:58,639 --> 00:19:00,390
Father, wait...

117
00:19:01,183 --> 00:19:03,393
I'm running late...
- Won't take long...

118
00:19:22,955 --> 00:19:28,293
Let the petals fill with colour...

119
00:19:28,293 --> 00:19:34,174
Let the breeze ruffle the spring...

120
00:19:35,384 --> 00:19:40,848
Let the breeze ruffle the spring.

121
00:19:41,181 --> 00:19:42,099
The next verse?

122
00:19:43,392 --> 00:19:48,230
Let the breeze ruffle the spring...

123
00:19:48,230 --> 00:19:51,400
Come along, my love...
Awake the garden to life.

124
00:20:18,969 --> 00:20:21,221
There... the vase has fallen...

125
00:20:35,819 --> 00:20:37,112
That's my bat.

126
00:20:45,996 --> 00:20:47,206
Hold this.

127
00:20:50,876 --> 00:20:52,127
Dad's shoes...

128
00:20:59,259 --> 00:21:00,886
Haider...
- Yes.

129
00:21:03,263 --> 00:21:05,515
Don't fight it...

130
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:07,851
What?

131
00:21:09,645 --> 00:21:10,812
You can cry...

132
00:21:12,522 --> 00:21:14,316
Where's the shoe brush?

133
00:21:17,527 --> 00:21:19,071
Haider...

134
00:21:23,158 --> 00:21:24,493
You can cry...

135
00:21:27,704 --> 00:21:28,956
Please.

136
00:21:47,057 --> 00:21:49,643
What is Arshee's car doing here?

137
00:21:49,643 --> 00:21:50,852
Stop!

138
00:22:10,414 --> 00:22:12,958
Now that is quite an interview!

139
00:22:14,042 --> 00:22:15,085
Brother...

140
00:22:15,085 --> 00:22:17,796
Of course, you couldn't
drop me at the airport.

141
00:22:17,796 --> 00:22:19,589
You don't get it...

142
00:22:19,589 --> 00:22:21,008
Don't say a word!

143
00:22:24,261 --> 00:22:25,137
- Brother...

144
00:22:26,388 --> 00:22:27,347
Listen...

145
00:22:27,848 --> 00:22:30,475
If I ever see you around her...

146
00:22:30,475 --> 00:22:32,436
you will disappear...

147
00:22:32,436 --> 00:22:33,687
just like your father.

148
00:22:33,687 --> 00:22:35,355
You get me? Like your...

149
00:22:40,402 --> 00:22:41,695
Arshee, move aside.

150
00:22:43,864 --> 00:22:45,824
Leave us! Please.

151
00:22:52,622 --> 00:22:54,333
- Come with me.

152
00:22:54,499 --> 00:22:55,500
- Let go of my hand.

153
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:56,460
Come with me.

154
00:23:02,341 --> 00:23:04,051
- You never heard my caution.

155
00:23:04,509 --> 00:23:06,720
You let her do as she pleases.

156
00:23:07,137 --> 00:23:08,972
And look now.

157
00:23:13,018 --> 00:23:14,978
She won't leave the house.

158
00:23:18,940 --> 00:23:20,525
I will not stop working.

159
00:23:22,694 --> 00:23:23,779
- What did you say?

160
00:23:24,905 --> 00:23:26,907
Look at me.
What did you say?

161
00:23:26,907 --> 00:23:28,450
Alright, calm down.

162
00:23:31,036 --> 00:23:34,164
You have to stop seeing Haider.

163
00:23:36,958 --> 00:23:38,335
Lucky is right about it.

164
00:23:39,961 --> 00:23:43,256
His life won't be the same
after the doctor's arrest.

165
00:23:43,256 --> 00:23:47,302
The families of militants
can neither get passports...

166
00:23:48,053 --> 00:23:50,764
nor government jobs.

167
00:23:51,765 --> 00:23:53,683
You know how it is.

168
00:23:54,017 --> 00:23:56,395
Yes. Very well...

169
00:23:58,772 --> 00:24:00,399
See what I mean?

170
00:24:02,401 --> 00:24:04,319
She is a stubborn one...

171
00:24:09,074 --> 00:24:10,283
Swear by the Koran.

172
00:24:12,619 --> 00:24:14,079
Place your hand on it.

173
00:24:17,582 --> 00:24:18,583
Arshee...

174
00:24:19,501 --> 00:24:20,210
Arshee...

175
00:24:22,879 --> 00:24:24,256
Open the door.

176
00:24:25,674 --> 00:24:26,883
Arshee...

177
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:31,972
There's another flight
to Bangalore at two.

178
00:24:31,972 --> 00:24:33,473
I don't want to go.

179
00:24:33,473 --> 00:24:35,225
Don't be a fool.

180
00:24:35,225 --> 00:24:36,476
"Don't want to go..."

181
00:24:37,644 --> 00:24:39,980
You don't turn down such a big job.

182
00:24:39,980 --> 00:24:41,690
Don't take it lightly.

183
00:24:42,732 --> 00:24:44,317
She has the mind of a child...

184
00:24:45,277 --> 00:24:46,653
- I'll speak to her.

185
00:24:49,114 --> 00:24:51,158
Here... I swear by the Koran...

186
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:00,167
Thank you.

187
00:25:15,891 --> 00:25:17,559
Good to see you...

188
00:26:34,844 --> 00:26:35,929
Why are you laughing?

189
00:26:37,389 --> 00:26:38,306
Sorry!

190
00:26:39,432 --> 00:26:42,185
You are so out of tune.

191
00:26:43,019 --> 00:26:45,939
I have been
begging you to teach me

192
00:26:45,939 --> 00:26:48,024
Since college...

193
00:26:48,024 --> 00:26:49,943
Teach me.

194
00:26:50,277 --> 00:26:51,903
Be my master.

195
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:54,698
And you look away.

196
00:26:55,490 --> 00:26:57,409
I'll have to sing like this now...

197
00:27:00,704 --> 00:27:02,122
why d0n't you?

198
00:27:03,957 --> 00:27:05,250
Please.
- No.

199
00:27:05,250 --> 00:27:08,295
Darling sis-in-law.

200
00:27:53,089 --> 00:27:54,049
My angel...

201
00:27:54,841 --> 00:27:56,301
Haider!

202
00:27:59,095 --> 00:28:00,180
You are home!

203
00:28:00,180 --> 00:28:01,806
Not a word of your arrival...

204
00:28:22,827 --> 00:28:25,872
You've lost so much weight...

205
00:28:27,207 --> 00:28:28,875
- Grown a beard too...

206
00:28:30,502 --> 00:28:32,754
Have you...

207
00:28:33,129 --> 00:28:35,048
written your thesis?

208
00:28:46,351 --> 00:28:48,311
Why are you so quiet?

209
00:28:52,315 --> 00:28:53,983
Say something?

210
00:28:58,363 --> 00:28:59,864
My angel...

211
00:29:09,165 --> 00:29:11,835
- These are hard times.

212
00:29:12,168 --> 00:29:14,879
It's a time for patience.

213
00:29:15,380 --> 00:29:16,881
The Koran tells us.

214
00:29:17,340 --> 00:29:19,884
- God is with the patient.

215
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:22,971
I've filed a petition in court.

216
00:29:27,350 --> 00:29:29,602
It will take some time...

217
00:29:31,312 --> 00:29:33,440
God-willing, all will be well soon.

218
00:29:36,943 --> 00:29:38,445
It doesn't look like it though.

219
00:29:41,322 --> 00:29:42,449
What?

220
00:29:45,326 --> 00:29:48,079
The two of you seem quite happy...

221
00:29:48,413 --> 00:29:50,665
with my father's disappearance.

222
00:29:53,251 --> 00:29:54,169
What?

223
00:29:54,419 --> 00:29:57,130
The two of you seem very happy...

224
00:29:58,047 --> 00:29:59,966
with my father's disappearance.

225
00:30:00,884 --> 00:30:01,968
- Haider...

226
00:30:03,845 --> 00:30:05,180
Have you lost it?

227
00:30:06,055 --> 00:30:07,474
What are you saying?

228
00:30:08,099 --> 00:30:10,518
Exactly what I see...

229
00:30:10,518 --> 00:30:11,436
dear uncle...

230
00:30:15,106 --> 00:30:18,276
Has your musical been on for a while?

231
00:30:18,693 --> 00:30:20,862
Or did this romantic production begin..

232
00:30:23,823 --> 00:30:25,575
After father's disappearance?

233
00:30:29,370 --> 00:30:30,246
Sis-in-law...

234
00:30:31,998 --> 00:30:33,458
How dare you!

235
00:30:33,708 --> 00:30:36,795
Is this the way to talk to your mother?

236
00:30:39,339 --> 00:30:41,174
Is this what you learnt in college?

237
00:30:41,466 --> 00:30:42,050
- Sis-in-law...

238
00:30:42,050 --> 00:30:44,761
Let his father return!

239
00:30:44,761 --> 00:30:45,762
He's a boy...

240
00:30:46,262 --> 00:30:47,263
Let it be...

241
00:30:47,931 --> 00:30:49,182
It will affect your health...

242
00:30:49,182 --> 00:30:50,934
Come along...

243
00:30:52,644 --> 00:30:53,937
Sis-in-law...

244
00:30:54,229 --> 00:30:55,230
Haider...

245
00:30:57,315 --> 00:30:58,858
I am sorry.

246
00:31:04,656 --> 00:31:09,077
Haider... I will explain...

247
00:31:11,287 --> 00:31:12,580
Sis-in-law...

248
00:31:17,627 --> 00:31:19,170
My angel...

249
00:31:20,255 --> 00:31:21,923
Sis-in-law...

250
00:31:25,593 --> 00:31:26,845
Haider...

251
00:31:27,262 --> 00:31:29,722
Come back...
It is time for curfew now.

252
00:31:30,890 --> 00:31:31,850
My angel...

253
00:31:33,935 --> 00:31:35,687
The army will grab him too.

254
00:31:35,687 --> 00:31:36,563
Please! Stop him!

255
00:31:36,563 --> 00:31:38,064
He will be fine.

256
00:31:38,064 --> 00:31:39,482
Please get him back.

257
00:31:39,482 --> 00:31:41,359
Sis-in-law...

258
00:31:42,193 --> 00:31:43,444
I'll manage it...

259
00:31:45,655 --> 00:31:46,865
Don't worry.

260
00:32:21,691 --> 00:32:23,401
Hello!

261
00:32:23,401 --> 00:32:25,194
Whom do you want?

262
00:32:25,194 --> 00:32:26,905
Salman?
Just a moment.

263
00:32:26,905 --> 00:32:28,114
Telephone.

264
00:32:30,450 --> 00:32:33,411
Hello!
Whom do you want?

265
00:32:34,078 --> 00:32:35,496
This call is for you.

266
00:32:50,762 --> 00:32:51,554
Hello...

267
00:32:52,472 --> 00:32:53,806
Whom do you want?

268
00:32:54,098 --> 00:32:55,433
Salman or Salman?

269
00:32:55,433 --> 00:32:57,060
Or Salman!?

270
00:32:58,728 --> 00:32:59,896
Do you mind taking the trouble...

271
00:33:00,104 --> 00:33:01,397
to introduce yourself?

272
00:33:01,606 --> 00:33:02,607
Your daddy!

273
00:33:03,733 --> 00:33:05,276
Superintendent of Police...

274
00:33:05,276 --> 00:33:06,277
Parvez Lone

275
00:33:10,239 --> 00:33:11,699
Sir... Sorry sir!

276
00:33:12,575 --> 00:33:13,743
Parvez sir...

277
00:33:19,165 --> 00:33:20,541
- Hello sir...

278
00:33:20,541 --> 00:33:23,336
Do we pay you to sing and dance?

279
00:33:24,170 --> 00:33:25,296
I apologise, sir!

280
00:33:25,672 --> 00:33:27,131
Do you know Haider?

281
00:33:27,548 --> 00:33:28,508
Haider Meer.

282
00:33:28,508 --> 00:33:30,093
Yes sir! I know him very well.

283
00:33:30,093 --> 00:33:31,427
We did high school together.

284
00:33:31,427 --> 00:33:32,470
- Find him!

285
00:33:33,012 --> 00:33:34,514
You'll find him around the lake...

286
00:33:35,807 --> 00:33:37,558
Take him home
to keep an eye on him...

287
00:33:37,558 --> 00:33:38,643
Yes, sir!

288
00:33:39,519 --> 00:33:40,520
Have a good day...

289
00:33:42,271 --> 00:33:44,774
You rascal! Didn't I tell you...

290
00:33:44,774 --> 00:33:47,527
to disconnect the phone before
brother Salman's movie.

291
00:33:48,653 --> 00:33:50,738
- No... not that..
- Want some of this?!

292
00:33:53,533 --> 00:33:54,784
Do you want some of this?

293
00:34:05,712 --> 00:34:06,504
Stop!

294
00:34:06,671 --> 00:34:07,672
Where are you going?

295
00:34:07,672 --> 00:34:08,631
What's in the bag?

296
00:34:08,631 --> 00:34:09,716
Check it...
- Yes, sir.

297
00:34:09,716 --> 00:34:10,508
Your identity card?

298
00:34:14,303 --> 00:34:16,139
And raise your hands...
Frisk him...

299
00:34:19,684 --> 00:34:20,601
Hello Captain.

300
00:34:20,601 --> 00:34:22,061
Salman...

301
00:34:22,061 --> 00:34:22,729
and Salman!

302
00:34:22,895 --> 00:34:23,980
Hello Major!

303
00:34:23,980 --> 00:34:25,481
Haider... How are you?

304
00:34:25,481 --> 00:34:27,275
When did you get back?
- You know him?

305
00:34:28,234 --> 00:34:29,777
Know him?!

306
00:34:30,486 --> 00:34:33,948
He's my sweetheart.

307
00:34:34,407 --> 00:34:37,910
Come on, let's get out of here
before curfew sets in.

308
00:34:38,286 --> 00:34:40,872
Or some Major will be welcoming us...

309
00:34:40,872 --> 00:34:42,040
in a military camp.

310
00:34:43,041 --> 00:34:44,167
Let me carry the bag.

311
00:34:44,375 --> 00:34:45,585
Haider, come.

312
00:34:47,587 --> 00:34:48,963
Goodbye, Colonel.

313
00:34:51,424 --> 00:34:52,133
Seated?

314
00:34:52,133 --> 00:34:53,259
Let's go.

315
00:34:59,974 --> 00:35:03,019
In Kashmir, God in heaven...

316
00:35:03,019 --> 00:35:04,937
and the army rules the earth.

317
00:35:04,937 --> 00:35:06,731
- And the army has a bible...

318
00:35:06,731 --> 00:35:08,232
<i>AF SP A</i>

319
00:35:09,650 --> 00:35:11,569
The Armed Forces Special Power Act.

320
00:35:11,569 --> 00:35:15,406
Khurram, my son is innocent.

321
00:35:15,823 --> 00:35:18,493
He's been detained
at the Faraz cinema camp.

322
00:35:18,659 --> 00:35:20,828
Please get him out.

323
00:35:22,955 --> 00:35:24,582
Uncle...

324
00:35:27,126 --> 00:35:30,088
I have no authority...

325
00:35:30,088 --> 00:35:31,714
to free your boy.

326
00:35:35,009 --> 00:35:36,886
I can't get him out...

327
00:35:37,762 --> 00:35:39,680
but I can possibly save his life.

328
00:35:40,098 --> 00:35:43,142
We have to shift him from
a camp to a prison.

329
00:35:44,477 --> 00:35:47,021
We need to get him charged...

330
00:35:47,647 --> 00:35:49,232
with a crime.

331
00:35:49,232 --> 00:35:51,025
- Sir.
- It'll be a false charge.

332
00:35:51,025 --> 00:35:52,527
A false charge.

333
00:35:53,319 --> 00:35:55,154
That would get him
a court hearing.

334
00:35:55,655 --> 00:36:00,493
Meaning...
no chances of dissapearance...

335
00:36:02,787 --> 00:36:03,871
<i>-</i> Okay?

336
00:36:12,004 --> 00:36:15,216
C-H-U-T-Z-P-A-H..

337
00:36:16,008 --> 00:36:17,927
Chutzpah...

338
00:36:18,803 --> 00:36:20,012
It is what it is.

339
00:36:20,513 --> 00:36:21,389
Chutzpah?

340
00:36:21,681 --> 00:36:22,682
What is it?

341
00:36:22,890 --> 00:36:28,479
Once a boy was arrested
for the murder of his parents.

342
00:36:30,731 --> 00:36:35,278
In the courtroom he sought...

343
00:36:35,278 --> 00:36:39,365
a lenient sentence from the judge.

344
00:36:40,283 --> 00:36:41,784
Bewildered, the judge asked...

345
00:36:42,410 --> 00:36:44,704
How do you expect mercy...

346
00:36:45,580 --> 00:36:48,249
after killing your own parents?

347
00:36:48,958 --> 00:36:50,376
The boy replied...

348
00:36:51,419 --> 00:36:55,798
Because I am an orphan now.

349
00:37:00,011 --> 00:37:02,180
That my friends is chutzpah.

350
00:37:02,180 --> 00:37:04,056
A Hebrew word.

351
00:37:04,390 --> 00:37:07,518
- It does rhyme a bit with AFSPA...

352
00:37:10,730 --> 00:37:12,857
- And similar in meaning too.

353
00:37:13,149 --> 00:37:14,025
AFS PA...

354
00:37:14,442 --> 00:37:15,276
Chutzpah...

355
00:37:16,360 --> 00:37:18,404
Chutzpah...
- AFSPA...

356
00:37:22,450 --> 00:37:23,784
- What will you do now?

357
00:37:23,784 --> 00:37:25,453
The same.

358
00:37:25,453 --> 00:37:26,662
Chutzpah!

359
00:37:31,417 --> 00:37:33,544
I'll look for my father.

360
00:37:37,256 --> 00:37:40,676
Where? In camps?

361
00:37:41,177 --> 00:37:42,470
In prisons?

362
00:37:44,222 --> 00:37:47,141
All of Kashmir is a prison.

363
00:37:48,517 --> 00:37:49,852
I will look for him everywhere.

364
00:38:02,907 --> 00:38:09,455
Jhelum, Jhelum, searching a shore

365
00:38:09,747 --> 00:38:15,962
Jhelum, Jhelum, searching a shore

366
00:38:19,257 --> 00:38:25,805
Jhelum, Jhelum, searching a shore

367
00:38:26,097 --> 00:38:31,644
Jhelum, Jhelum, searching a shore

368
00:38:39,485 --> 00:38:46,242
In whose eyes the sun sets

369
00:38:46,242 --> 00:38:52,123
The sun sets in whose eyes

370
00:38:52,123 --> 00:38:59,005
The waters of the river Jhelum
Have turned saline

371
00:39:02,008 --> 00:39:07,555
Jhelum, Jhelum, searching a shore

372
00:39:08,639 --> 00:39:15,479
Jhelum, Jhelum, searching a shore

373
00:39:51,474 --> 00:39:57,980
Who to ask for how much longer

374
00:39:57,980 --> 00:40:03,652
This pain we must continue to bear

375
00:40:04,570 --> 00:40:11,077
Holding the hand of the blinded night

376
00:40:11,077 --> 00:40:16,207
We must walk yet how much longer

377
00:40:22,004 --> 00:40:28,302
Blood, blood, blood,
blood has become the colour of time

378
00:40:28,594 --> 00:40:34,892
Blood, blood, blood,
blood has become the colour of time

379
00:40:35,393 --> 00:40:38,145
Blood, blood, blood

380
00:40:38,354 --> 00:40:42,650
Blood is a moulten ember

381
00:40:42,650 --> 00:40:44,110
- God! Oh God!

382
00:40:44,402 --> 00:40:45,403
- I'm still alive...

383
00:40:46,237 --> 00:40:51,158
- Thank you, Oh Lord! I am still alive!

384
00:41:42,126 --> 00:41:42,668
- Gentlemen

385
00:41:43,085 --> 00:41:45,337
- Delhi has approved Operation Nightingale.

386
00:41:45,713 --> 00:41:48,883
We have complete support to
arm, fund and run...

387
00:41:49,300 --> 00:41:51,927
the counter insurgency force...

388
00:41:52,261 --> 00:41:53,387
- Complete support!

389
00:41:53,387 --> 00:41:55,806
The enemy's foes are our friends...

390
00:41:55,806 --> 00:41:58,767
Any individual or group...

391
00:41:58,767 --> 00:42:01,729
anyone with a grudge against...

392
00:42:01,729 --> 00:42:04,398
the Hizbul Mujahideen and
Pakistan's proxy war...

393
00:42:04,398 --> 00:42:07,067
surrendered militants,
detainees, undertrials...

394
00:42:07,401 --> 00:42:09,111
- will be our primary recruits.

395
00:42:09,111 --> 00:42:11,363
Ikhwan-ul-Mukhbireen

396
00:42:13,324 --> 00:42:17,119
The Army will run the operation
but your support will be crucial...

397
00:42:17,119 --> 00:42:19,330
in recruitment and intelligence.

398
00:42:20,331 --> 00:42:22,458
Let the Nightingale start singing.

399
00:42:23,626 --> 00:42:25,169
It' <i>s</i> catch and kill.

400
00:42:25,169 --> 00:42:27,087
- We need to nourish the lkhwan

401
00:42:27,087 --> 00:42:28,964
lkhwan-ul-Mukhbireen ..

402
00:42:29,215 --> 00:42:33,385
With arms, money, power...

403
00:42:35,054 --> 00:42:37,014
Isn't that Kaul's house?

404
00:42:37,014 --> 00:42:39,141
- Yes, he's in Jammu,
in a refugee camp.

405
00:42:39,934 --> 00:42:42,645
I think he's moved to Bombay...

406
00:42:46,607 --> 00:42:49,777
How many cases do you have?

407
00:42:50,027 --> 00:42:51,987
About 75-80.

408
00:42:53,197 --> 00:42:58,953
But why would they take up arms
against their own?

409
00:42:59,787 --> 00:43:01,163
For freedom...

410
00:43:07,169 --> 00:43:10,464
A prisoner will exchange
anything for his freedom.

411
00:43:12,299 --> 00:43:14,134
Parvez...

412
00:43:14,134 --> 00:43:15,135
What...

413
00:43:17,012 --> 00:43:17,888
What do we get?

414
00:43:19,431 --> 00:43:21,392
Delhi.

415
00:43:30,067 --> 00:43:31,110
Take them away.

416
00:43:33,529 --> 00:43:36,115
A dead militant is worth
a hundred thousand rupees.

417
00:43:37,408 --> 00:43:38,742
Call the media.
- Yes, sir!

418
00:43:45,124 --> 00:43:46,625
Haider...

419
00:43:47,167 --> 00:43:49,003
Hear me out...

420
00:43:58,929 --> 00:43:59,763
Who...

421
00:44:01,265 --> 00:44:02,683
Who are you angry with?

422
00:44:03,475 --> 00:44:04,351
And why?

423
00:44:04,351 --> 00:44:06,937
He's not just your father,
but my brother too...

424
00:44:07,146 --> 00:44:08,522
my only brother...

425
00:44:08,856 --> 00:44:09,356
It's been...

426
00:44:12,067 --> 00:44:16,905
Days since your mother
managed a smile.

427
00:44:18,741 --> 00:44:21,327
She's been crying for weeks.

428
00:44:23,120 --> 00:44:26,248
And you accuse us of singing...

429
00:44:26,248 --> 00:44:28,334
and dancing in joy...

430
00:44:28,542 --> 00:44:30,169
secretly?

431
00:44:30,711 --> 00:44:33,255
She is my brother's wife.

432
00:44:35,299 --> 00:44:37,009
My dearest sister-in-law.

433
00:44:38,052 --> 00:44:39,386
Haider...

434
00:44:43,891 --> 00:44:45,017
Here, take a look.

435
00:44:47,728 --> 00:44:49,355
I am contesting the elections.

436
00:44:49,521 --> 00:44:51,190
Do you know why?

437
00:44:52,816 --> 00:44:54,068
Ask me why?

438
00:44:56,570 --> 00:44:58,238
Why?
- For my brother.

439
00:44:58,697 --> 00:44:59,990
What else!

440
00:45:01,283 --> 00:45:03,619
Once I'm in power...

441
00:45:03,619 --> 00:45:07,498
I'll tear open every prison
and bring him home.

442
00:45:08,957 --> 00:45:11,710
Uncle, you may wait
for the elections.

443
00:45:13,379 --> 00:45:15,589
My battle has already begun.

444
00:45:24,098 --> 00:45:25,891
"Armed Forces Special Powers Act,

445
00:45:26,058 --> 00:45:27,518
Rule 4 of section 5 says -

446
00:45:27,518 --> 00:45:30,396
Any person taken under custody under
this Act shall be handed over...

447
00:45:30,396 --> 00:45:34,817
to the office in charge of the nearest police
station with the least possible delay."

448
00:45:35,734 --> 00:45:37,778
The least possible delay...

449
00:45:38,821 --> 00:45:40,614
It's been twenty days and
there's no word of him.

450
00:45:42,825 --> 00:45:44,910
If everything worked by the book...

451
00:45:45,661 --> 00:45:47,287
do you think Kashmir would
have been the hell it is?

452
00:45:47,913 --> 00:45:52,084
Pandit Nehru promised Kashmiris
a plebiscite with the world as his witness

453
00:45:52,084 --> 00:45:53,293
What happened?

454
00:45:53,544 --> 00:45:55,003
- Let aside plebiscite...

455
00:45:55,003 --> 00:45:56,296
Even the first condition
to plebiscite...

456
00:45:56,588 --> 00:45:58,340
demilitarization...

457
00:45:58,340 --> 00:46:00,050
did not happen.

458
00:46:00,050 --> 00:46:01,635
Neither India, nor Pakistan...

459
00:46:02,678 --> 00:46:05,889
When two elephants fight...

460
00:46:06,974 --> 00:46:08,976
it is the grass
that is trampled upon.

461
00:46:08,976 --> 00:46:10,561
I agree, uncle...

462
00:46:12,146 --> 00:46:13,897
But I want to file a formal report.

463
00:46:16,775 --> 00:46:19,695
Don't mess with the army, son.

464
00:46:20,821 --> 00:46:23,449
If you file a formal report...

465
00:46:23,449 --> 00:46:26,243
the chances of finding him
will become even more bleak.

466
00:46:33,667 --> 00:46:34,752
Rocky is good...

467
00:46:34,752 --> 00:46:36,003
But you are in India...

468
00:46:36,003 --> 00:46:37,588
Watch the Indian action hero...

469
00:46:37,588 --> 00:46:39,298
Salman Khan...
Tell them...

470
00:46:39,798 --> 00:46:42,176
This film was...

471
00:46:42,551 --> 00:46:43,886
chutzpah!
- Yes.

472
00:46:44,261 --> 00:46:46,305
What is Chutzpah?

473
00:46:46,305 --> 00:46:48,640
It's a big film... a big hit.

474
00:46:48,807 --> 00:46:50,267
A blockbuster...

475
00:46:50,559 --> 00:46:52,478
Can I see it?
- Yes, sure.

476
00:46:52,478 --> 00:46:54,855
Salman... Salman Khan.
- This guy?

477
00:47:04,740 --> 00:47:06,116
Are you done shooting?

478
00:47:06,116 --> 00:47:07,785
I'll eat...
- Come...

479
00:47:10,537 --> 00:47:12,414
Yes please...

480
00:47:13,290 --> 00:47:13,916
- Haider...

481
00:47:13,916 --> 00:47:16,418
- Eat some more...
- Haider...

482
00:47:16,627 --> 00:47:17,669
- Haider...

483
00:47:17,669 --> 00:47:20,589
- I can't see a thing...

484
00:47:28,555 --> 00:47:29,389
Salam Alaikum, uncle.

485
00:47:29,932 --> 00:47:31,225
Princess...

486
00:47:32,476 --> 00:47:33,268
Where's your prince?

487
00:47:36,772 --> 00:47:38,190
Mister...

488
00:47:38,816 --> 00:47:41,193
Your mother has been on a
hunger strike for two days now.

489
00:47:42,361 --> 00:47:48,784
She won't even touch water till
she she sees you.

490
00:47:56,208 --> 00:47:57,876
Open the door, sis-in-law!

491
00:47:58,794 --> 00:48:00,879
I present to you
the sparkle of your eyes...

492
00:48:00,879 --> 00:48:03,090
- your little prince.

493
00:48:15,227 --> 00:48:16,436
My angel...

494
00:48:20,232 --> 00:48:22,651
You know, if you go to Delhi...

495
00:48:22,651 --> 00:48:24,570
you'll easily get a job.

496
00:48:25,112 --> 00:48:25,904
Where?

497
00:48:26,405 --> 00:48:27,948
The National School of Drama.

498
00:48:29,950 --> 00:48:31,994
Please do stop your theatrics now!

499
00:48:34,663 --> 00:48:36,039
What do you mean?

500
00:48:36,707 --> 00:48:37,791
Why am I to blame?

501
00:48:38,917 --> 00:48:40,335
Emotional blackmail...

502
00:48:40,961 --> 00:48:42,629
ever since my childhood...

503
00:48:43,547 --> 00:48:45,924
you would stop eating or leave home.

504
00:48:46,383 --> 00:48:49,303
You would cry away
or threaten suicude.

505
00:48:49,803 --> 00:48:52,848
That is how you sent me
away to Aligarh.

506
00:48:53,181 --> 00:48:54,808
Banished me from my home...

507
00:48:56,184 --> 00:48:57,394
away from my father...

508
00:49:12,951 --> 00:49:15,370
If I hadn't pushed you to Aligarh...

509
00:49:16,371 --> 00:49:19,166
you know well, where you
would have ended up!

510
00:49:39,686 --> 00:49:40,562
What is this?

511
00:49:44,024 --> 00:49:45,567
Where did you get this from?

512
00:49:48,111 --> 00:49:49,154
I demand an answer.

513
00:49:49,154 --> 00:49:51,406
It belongs to a friend.

514
00:49:51,406 --> 00:49:53,116
I'll return it tomorrow.

515
00:49:55,243 --> 00:49:57,537
Ah, now you are friends
with militants?

516
00:49:59,164 --> 00:50:02,167
It's a pistol today,
tomorrow it will be a Kalashnikov...

517
00:50:04,670 --> 00:50:06,129
Going for arms training in Pakistan?

518
00:50:06,129 --> 00:50:07,381
Are you?!

519
00:50:07,381 --> 00:50:10,050
Yes, I'll go across.

520
00:50:19,017 --> 00:50:19,935
Sis-in-law...

521
00:50:25,232 --> 00:50:26,191
Are you alright?

522
00:50:38,537 --> 00:50:40,455
- These are dark days.

523
00:50:40,747 --> 00:50:43,959
Birds of prey circle above...

524
00:50:45,043 --> 00:50:48,964
They prey without care...

525
00:50:50,465 --> 00:50:55,220
Kites grab sparrows and
falcons feast on Nightingales...

526
00:50:55,220 --> 00:50:57,431
- Keep him away from it all...

527
00:50:58,015 --> 00:50:59,558
I have a friend
at the university in Aligarh.

528
00:50:59,558 --> 00:51:01,518
Send him there.

529
00:51:02,102 --> 00:51:05,522
- Let him see the other side of India.

530
00:51:05,522 --> 00:51:10,485
A world without imprisoned days
and curfews at nights.

531
00:51:11,528 --> 00:51:13,989
Doctor Sahib won't let him go.

532
00:51:14,573 --> 00:51:17,242
I'll take care of the doctor.

533
00:51:17,576 --> 00:51:18,910
- Make Haider come around.

534
00:51:18,910 --> 00:51:19,661
Alright?

535
00:51:20,912 --> 00:51:23,331
Now cheer up...

536
00:51:23,832 --> 00:51:26,084
Smile, my child!

537
00:51:29,546 --> 00:51:33,884
This house is a ruin
without your laughter.

538
00:51:35,052 --> 00:51:36,386
Father...

539
00:51:37,679 --> 00:51:39,681
A bride for Khurram...

540
00:51:40,390 --> 00:51:41,808
and it will be a happy home.

541
00:51:41,808 --> 00:51:43,977
He doesn't seem to like any girls.

542
00:51:45,896 --> 00:51:47,064
Why Mr. Khurram?

543
00:51:48,065 --> 00:51:49,441
Well!

544
00:51:50,484 --> 00:51:52,611
All the pretty ones...

545
00:51:53,779 --> 00:51:55,572
are already married...

546
00:51:57,157 --> 00:51:58,784
just like you!

547
00:52:07,793 --> 00:52:10,253
You wicked man...

548
00:52:15,717 --> 00:52:19,930
No father wants to see
his son as a militant.

549
00:52:19,930 --> 00:52:23,642
But sending him away
is not a way out either...

550
00:52:26,394 --> 00:52:29,356
It is a grave problem...

551
00:52:29,356 --> 00:52:31,650
and an old one too.

552
00:52:32,275 --> 00:52:36,154
We have lost a few
generations already...

553
00:52:38,365 --> 00:52:44,371
God alone knows when blood
will stop raining on our land.

554
00:52:45,205 --> 00:52:47,374
It's all up to India.

555
00:52:50,377 --> 00:52:54,339
As they say in India, "birth right".

556
00:52:55,715 --> 00:52:59,761
And we are only claiming our right...

557
00:52:59,761 --> 00:53:00,679
Freedom.

558
00:53:02,472 --> 00:53:04,141
Freedom...

559
00:53:06,017 --> 00:53:12,023
Gandhi won it for India...
not the gun.

560
00:53:13,275 --> 00:53:17,154
The gun only knows how to avenge...

561
00:53:18,697 --> 00:53:20,031
Commander...

562
00:53:20,574 --> 00:53:25,412
revenge does not set you free..

563
00:53:25,412 --> 00:53:30,292
True freedom lies beyond violence..

564
00:53:32,586 --> 00:53:38,508
Remember...
Revenge only begets revenge.

565
00:53:45,098 --> 00:53:48,810
- Don't you understand?
Can't you hear me?

566
00:53:50,061 --> 00:53:51,980
I am not going anywhere.

567
00:53:51,980 --> 00:53:53,565
I am staying here.

568
00:53:57,402 --> 00:53:59,196
With my father.

569
00:54:11,917 --> 00:54:13,710
Jahid.. to the left...

570
00:54:24,512 --> 00:54:25,597
What is it now?

571
00:54:25,764 --> 00:54:27,766
I ask you, one last time...

572
00:54:28,975 --> 00:54:31,478
Will you go or not?

573
00:54:31,770 --> 00:54:33,104
Should I write it down for you?

574
00:54:33,104 --> 00:54:34,356
I will not!

575
00:54:37,692 --> 00:54:38,860
What is this, mother?!

576
00:54:39,611 --> 00:54:40,403
Will you go or not?

577
00:54:40,612 --> 00:54:43,031
Please hear me out...

578
00:54:43,031 --> 00:54:43,740
- Will you go or not?

579
00:54:43,740 --> 00:54:44,950
Put the gun down mother...

580
00:54:44,950 --> 00:54:46,409
Will you go or not!?

581
00:54:48,745 --> 00:54:49,788
Mother, please...

582
00:54:59,005 --> 00:55:01,383
Would you really have
shot yourself that day?

583
00:55:03,260 --> 00:55:04,803
Do you doubt me?

584
00:55:06,596 --> 00:55:08,473
No. I'm sure.

585
00:55:09,975 --> 00:55:11,810
You wouldn't have.

586
00:55:17,691 --> 00:55:21,194
Was there any other reason
for me to live... besides you?

587
00:55:26,116 --> 00:55:27,742
Or is there?

588
00:55:30,370 --> 00:55:35,292
I bore those long
painful years for you...

589
00:55:35,625 --> 00:55:39,546
Don't...There you go again...

590
00:55:39,546 --> 00:55:41,172
You have to listen to me.

591
00:55:44,301 --> 00:55:47,304
Your father never really
cared for me. Our marriage was dead.

592
00:55:49,264 --> 00:55:51,683
Which is why he gambled his life...

593
00:55:52,100 --> 00:55:53,435
our home...

594
00:55:54,227 --> 00:55:56,229
<i>our honor...</i>

595
00:55:56,229 --> 00:55:59,816
your future... risked it all.

596
00:56:02,861 --> 00:56:09,576
Do we have to see everything
through your eyes?

597
00:56:10,952 --> 00:56:11,953
Always?

598
00:56:13,955 --> 00:56:18,251
There are other ways of seeing.
Try sometime...

599
00:56:26,051 --> 00:56:29,554
Either way,
you will always blame me...

600
00:56:32,807 --> 00:56:36,811
I am used to it.

601
00:56:42,484 --> 00:56:46,571
I know you love your father
more than anyone else...

602
00:56:50,200 --> 00:56:52,327
You certainly don't realise...

603
00:56:54,079 --> 00:56:56,831
What I went through
when you were away.

604
00:56:58,208 --> 00:57:04,047
Hilaal had lost himself in
the hospital, a saint saving lives.

605
00:57:06,674 --> 00:57:12,430
I used to wail like a
hollow bamboo in your memory.

606
00:57:17,602 --> 00:57:22,148
I would wait months for you
to return home in the holidays.

607
00:57:26,111 --> 00:57:32,158
It is my fate to long... to wait...

608
00:57:38,873 --> 00:57:40,750
First for you...

609
00:57:44,087 --> 00:57:44,879
Now...

610
00:57:48,049 --> 00:57:49,175
And now?

611
00:57:52,220 --> 00:57:58,309
The wives of disappeared people
are called 'half-widows' here.

612
00:58:02,230 --> 00:58:04,149
We can only wait.

613
00:58:09,446 --> 00:58:11,656
That is all I can do.

614
00:58:16,369 --> 00:58:17,454
Wait.

615
00:58:18,746 --> 00:58:20,081
For father to return?

616
00:58:22,041 --> 00:58:22,917
Yes.

617
00:58:26,588 --> 00:58:29,007
Or for his corpse.

618
00:58:35,221 --> 00:58:36,806
My father is alive!

619
00:58:38,558 --> 00:58:39,684
He's alive!

620
00:58:41,186 --> 00:58:42,437
Do you understand?!

621
00:58:44,856 --> 00:58:48,568
Please tell me mother, he's alive...

622
00:58:51,237 --> 00:58:52,822
He's alive!

623
00:59:01,956 --> 00:59:03,791
Tell me mother...

624
00:59:06,294 --> 00:59:07,879
he's alive...

625
00:59:09,672 --> 00:59:11,257
Please tell me...

626
00:59:20,642 --> 00:59:22,310
Elections are the first step...

627
00:59:22,310 --> 00:59:23,436
on the long road to peace...

628
00:59:23,436 --> 00:59:26,397
It is a difficult journey...
but we can see our destination...

629
00:59:26,397 --> 00:59:29,067
Wherever you come from...

630
00:59:29,067 --> 00:59:30,652
people want the same thing...

631
00:59:30,902 --> 00:59:33,988
Our schools have been turned
into Army camps...

632
00:59:33,988 --> 00:59:36,115
It is not a democracy...

633
00:59:36,991 --> 00:59:40,370
it a suffocating system.
A 'suffo-cracy'!

634
00:59:43,998 --> 00:59:48,294
The town squares are lined with bunkers
and streets with barbed wires.

635
00:59:48,294 --> 00:59:50,088
According to the APDP there are...

636
00:59:50,088 --> 00:59:52,715
over eight thousand people
who are missing since arrest...

637
00:59:59,097 --> 01:00:00,598
- Your numbers are wrong...

638
01:00:00,598 --> 01:00:03,518
What about those three hundred
thousand Kashmiri Pandits...

639
01:00:03,518 --> 01:00:06,229
displaced from their homes,
living as refugees...

640
01:00:06,229 --> 01:00:08,022
Will you not count them
amongst the disappeared?

641
01:00:08,022 --> 01:00:11,651
My brother disappeared months back.

642
01:00:11,651 --> 01:00:15,280
We have to raise our voices
to search for our own.

643
01:00:15,280 --> 01:00:17,115
- What do we want?
- Freedom...

644
01:00:17,115 --> 01:00:18,950
- We'll snatch away...
- Freedom...

645
01:00:18,950 --> 01:00:21,661
And for this I am
running for elections...

646
01:00:27,875 --> 01:00:32,130
I would like to remind you
of our neighbor that arms and trains...

647
01:00:32,130 --> 01:00:36,134
misguided Kashmiri youth
to kill innocent people...

648
01:00:36,467 --> 01:00:42,307
In 1948, they had looted Kashmiri's
when they came as tribals...

649
01:00:47,770 --> 01:00:51,024
Raped the women and
killed their children.

650
01:00:52,900 --> 01:00:57,155
It was the Indian army that
shed blood to save Kashmir.

651
01:00:58,990 --> 01:01:02,410
- And if we aren't around,
it'll happen again.

652
01:01:02,660 --> 01:01:06,080
Does the law allow you to torture
people you've arrested?

653
01:01:06,080 --> 01:01:08,374
The Indian army is one of the most...

654
01:01:08,374 --> 01:01:10,835
disciplined armed
forces in the world.

655
01:01:11,127 --> 01:01:15,006
We train our officers to interrogate,
and not torture.

656
01:01:15,214 --> 01:01:20,678
Amidst militant attacks,
today Kashmir goes to vote.

657
01:01:20,678 --> 01:01:23,848
Militant groups have
exploded bombs in...

658
01:01:23,848 --> 01:01:26,476
Srinagar, Barahmulla and Anantnag.

659
01:01:27,393 --> 01:01:29,854
I want you to understand
the ground reality.

660
01:01:29,854 --> 01:01:33,149
Separatists are not demanding
freedom from India...

661
01:01:35,318 --> 01:01:37,320
but enslavement to Pakistan.

662
01:01:37,320 --> 01:01:41,616
- Indian troops coerced reluctant
voters into polling booths.

663
01:01:41,616 --> 01:01:44,077
- India has rubbished these allegations.

664
01:01:44,077 --> 01:01:47,080
- However, the voter turnout
remained very low.

665
01:01:47,080 --> 01:01:49,832
- Koshmar constituency saw
the lowest turn out...

666
01:01:49,832 --> 01:01:52,085
where only 110 votes were registered.

667
01:01:52,377 --> 01:01:53,544
- Congratulations!

668
01:01:53,544 --> 01:01:54,754
You have won by a hundred votes.

669
01:01:54,754 --> 01:01:56,881
Congratulations!
- Congratulations!

670
01:02:13,398 --> 01:02:16,484
These traditional folk entertainers
known as Bhand...

671
01:02:16,484 --> 01:02:19,696
are enacting a play
which speaks of a new Kashmir...

672
01:02:20,279 --> 01:02:21,656
- A peaceful Kashmir...

673
01:02:21,656 --> 01:02:24,909
- will the new regime bring
a brighter future for Kashmir?

674
01:02:25,493 --> 01:02:26,953
Only time will tell.

675
01:03:59,754 --> 01:04:00,755
Nice...

676
01:04:05,051 --> 01:04:06,511
Very nice article.

677
01:04:09,347 --> 01:04:10,223
Thank you.

678
01:04:12,642 --> 01:04:15,102
- Come inside...

679
01:04:16,437 --> 01:04:18,022
Come in...

680
01:04:18,022 --> 01:04:19,607
Why are you standing there?

681
01:04:19,607 --> 01:04:21,400
- Why don't you come inside...

682
01:04:21,984 --> 01:04:23,861
What has possessed you?

683
01:04:24,946 --> 01:04:26,447
What is wrong with him?

684
01:04:26,447 --> 01:04:27,448
I don't know...

685
01:04:27,782 --> 01:04:30,451
These days he just stands
outside the door for hours.

686
01:04:31,285 --> 01:04:32,912
He doesn't come in...

687
01:04:32,912 --> 01:04:34,080
- Frisk him.

688
01:04:40,419 --> 01:04:41,629
Where are you coming from?

689
01:04:42,713 --> 01:04:43,756
Where are you going?

690
01:04:44,507 --> 01:04:45,383
What's in your pockets?

691
01:04:45,383 --> 01:04:46,133
Your identity card?

692
01:04:48,219 --> 01:04:49,011
You may go now.

693
01:04:53,975 --> 01:04:56,185
People have become so used to
body searches...

694
01:04:56,185 --> 01:04:58,145
that unless they are frisked...

695
01:04:58,145 --> 01:05:01,107
they fear entering their own homes.

696
01:05:01,732 --> 01:05:06,571
It's a psychological disorder...
the 'New Disease'...

697
01:05:08,281 --> 01:05:10,157
Are you a doctor?

698
01:05:10,741 --> 01:05:12,326
The doctor's soul.

699
01:05:39,896 --> 01:05:41,522
Why are you following me?

700
01:05:42,231 --> 01:05:43,274
What do you want?

701
01:05:43,816 --> 01:05:44,650
A message.

702
01:05:45,484 --> 01:05:46,235
What?

703
01:05:46,485 --> 01:05:47,403
A message.

704
01:05:47,862 --> 01:05:50,489
I have no message for anyone.

705
01:05:50,823 --> 01:05:52,116
But I do...

706
01:05:52,867 --> 01:05:55,286
A message for Haider,
from his father.

707
01:06:03,085 --> 01:06:04,045
What?

708
01:06:05,171 --> 01:06:08,549
A message for Haider shall be
delivered to Haider! Right?

709
01:06:18,851 --> 01:06:20,019
Here is my number.

710
01:06:20,019 --> 01:06:22,396
I will wait for his call.

711
01:06:25,316 --> 01:06:27,026
What is your name?

712
01:06:27,401 --> 01:06:28,277
Rooh...

713
01:06:29,111 --> 01:06:30,446
Roohdaar.

714
01:06:47,505 --> 01:06:54,011
Do we exist or do we not?!

715
01:06:59,100 --> 01:06:59,892
Haider...

716
01:06:59,892 --> 01:07:01,185
I have to tell you something...

717
01:07:01,519 --> 01:07:02,979
Listen to me...

718
01:07:03,646 --> 01:07:05,439
Haider... Listen to me.

719
01:07:05,856 --> 01:07:07,900
There's a message from your father.

720
01:07:25,501 --> 01:07:26,127
Hello...

721
01:07:27,044 --> 01:07:27,670
Hello...

722
01:07:28,671 --> 01:07:29,463
Who is it?

723
01:07:30,881 --> 01:07:31,716
I am Haider...

724
01:07:32,883 --> 01:07:33,884
Haider who?

725
01:07:34,427 --> 01:07:35,553
Haider Meer.

726
01:07:37,304 --> 01:07:38,556
Whom do you want?

727
01:07:40,016 --> 01:07:40,891
Roohdaar...

728
01:07:42,226 --> 01:07:45,146
Downtown. Zaina Kadal bridge...
Tomorrow, 9 am.

729
01:07:45,146 --> 01:07:46,272
Okay... I...

730
01:08:13,632 --> 01:08:15,718
What's he heading to Downtown for?

731
01:08:27,897 --> 01:08:28,981
Salman...

732
01:08:30,191 --> 01:08:30,733
To go?

733
01:08:33,569 --> 01:08:34,278
Or not to go?

734
01:09:46,851 --> 01:09:48,018
Where is my father?

735
01:09:48,894 --> 01:09:50,229
In a faraway place...

736
01:09:51,647 --> 01:09:53,440
Very far...

737
01:09:55,359 --> 01:09:58,320
You said you had
a message from him...

738
01:09:58,320 --> 01:09:59,947
Yes.

739
01:10:00,698 --> 01:10:01,907
What is it?

740
01:10:06,787 --> 01:10:08,164
Revenge.

741
01:10:11,417 --> 01:10:13,043
Vengeance.

742
01:10:13,919 --> 01:10:15,379
Vengeance from whom?

743
01:10:16,172 --> 01:10:16,964
And why?

744
01:10:17,423 --> 01:10:19,758
From a murderer...

745
01:10:20,009 --> 01:10:21,760
for a murder.

746
01:10:26,682 --> 01:10:29,518
You seem to have confused matters.

747
01:10:29,518 --> 01:10:32,771
My father was arrested by the army
and one of these days...

748
01:10:32,771 --> 01:10:35,649
we will find out where
they're holding him.

749
01:10:38,027 --> 01:10:41,155
Let the petals fill with color...

750
01:10:41,155 --> 01:10:43,365
Let the breeze ruffle the spring...

751
01:11:05,804 --> 01:11:08,766
Come along, my love...

752
01:11:08,766 --> 01:11:12,770
Awake the garden to life.

753
01:11:28,953 --> 01:11:33,332
The prison is a sullen ghost...

754
01:11:34,416 --> 01:11:41,590
Ask the breeze for a whiff of hope...

755
01:11:43,842 --> 01:11:49,515
Oh, someone please...

756
01:11:49,515 --> 01:11:55,688
speak of the beauty of my beloved.

757
01:11:55,688 --> 01:12:02,069
- When fatigue would muffle
our screams in the prison...

758
01:12:02,903 --> 01:12:07,324
a sole voice would
rise through the night...

759
01:12:07,700 --> 01:12:10,286
a balm to our agony...

760
01:12:14,832 --> 01:12:18,627
The lights were never turned off...

761
01:12:18,627 --> 01:12:21,130
we craved for the darkness.

762
01:12:21,880 --> 01:12:24,675
Lice roamed on our broken bodies...

763
01:12:24,675 --> 01:12:26,802
and vengeful snakes in our hearts.

764
01:12:27,511 --> 01:12:30,347
MAMA-2 was the other name for hell.

765
01:12:30,347 --> 01:12:34,059
Men returned as from there as mere
shadows of themselves.

766
01:12:34,059 --> 01:12:35,269
Officer...

767
01:12:35,978 --> 01:12:39,356
How many Area Commanders
do you have in Anantnag?

768
01:12:40,941 --> 01:12:42,526
Where did you get the RDX from?

769
01:12:43,110 --> 01:12:45,195
- Aren't you from the Binori mosque?

770
01:12:45,571 --> 01:12:48,282
Met Brigadier Badaam?

771
01:12:48,824 --> 01:12:51,201
Twenty children died
in your bomb blasts...

772
01:12:51,744 --> 01:12:53,162
Do you have any children?

773
01:12:54,204 --> 01:12:54,997
No?

774
01:12:56,040 --> 01:12:57,416
You won't father any.

775
01:12:57,833 --> 01:12:59,668
Give me their names!

776
01:13:11,847 --> 01:13:14,933
Sir, I swear I'm a student.

777
01:13:15,100 --> 01:13:16,935
I swear, sir...

778
01:13:17,102 --> 01:13:19,563
I'm not a militant.

779
01:13:20,022 --> 01:13:21,273
I'm not a militant.

780
01:13:21,482 --> 01:13:23,442
Let's hear it all together...
Long live India!

781
01:13:23,442 --> 01:13:24,651
Long live India!

782
01:13:24,651 --> 01:13:26,236
- Long live India!
- Long live India!

783
01:13:26,236 --> 01:13:28,864
Long live India!

784
01:13:34,078 --> 01:13:37,247
Since that day doctor
and I were always together...

785
01:13:37,247 --> 01:13:39,750
like body and soul...

786
01:13:41,001 --> 01:13:44,963
We bore our torments together
in the same cell.

787
01:13:45,631 --> 01:13:47,800
We were chained together.

788
01:13:49,927 --> 01:13:53,305
It seems we will be
killed together as well.

789
01:13:54,598 --> 01:13:57,643
You can die doctor, but I won't.

790
01:14:00,187 --> 01:14:01,397
And how is that?

791
01:14:02,147 --> 01:14:05,109
You are the body
and I'm the soul...

792
01:14:05,109 --> 01:14:07,569
You are mortal and I'm immortal!

793
01:14:11,073 --> 01:14:13,909
Are you a Shia or a Sunni?

794
01:14:15,536 --> 01:14:18,372
I am the river and the tree...

795
01:14:19,039 --> 01:14:21,750
The Jhelum and the Chinar...

796
01:14:23,252 --> 01:14:25,963
I'm both..
a temple and a mosque...

797
01:14:26,672 --> 01:14:29,258
A Shia and a Sunni, I'm both.

798
01:14:30,717 --> 01:14:32,386
A Hindu as well.

799
01:14:34,304 --> 01:14:36,932
I always was... I am...

800
01:14:37,933 --> 01:14:39,810
I will always be...

801
01:14:42,855 --> 01:14:46,608
They moved us to other
camps for interrogation.

802
01:14:48,235 --> 01:14:51,280
Strange camps... stranger names...

803
01:14:53,449 --> 01:14:56,410
Bo-Bo land, Hotel 6...

804
01:14:56,660 --> 01:14:57,911
Faraz cinema...

805
01:15:41,163 --> 01:15:45,918
And one day, there was a revelation.

806
01:15:49,338 --> 01:15:51,965
It was Khurram who
betrayed your father.

807
01:15:56,428 --> 01:15:58,764
Khurram had handled
most of the cases of...

808
01:15:58,764 --> 01:16:01,141
militants caught or
surrendered in Kashmir.

809
01:16:02,017 --> 01:16:06,021
With his help Indian Intelligence
played their trump card...

810
01:16:06,355 --> 01:16:10,150
forming a militia
to kill militants...

811
01:16:10,150 --> 01:16:12,236
A counter-insurgency force...

812
01:16:12,611 --> 01:16:14,238
lkhwan-ul-Mukhbireen

813
01:16:18,158 --> 01:16:21,453
The lkhwans knew
militant sympathisers...

814
01:16:21,453 --> 01:16:23,455
and their modus operandi.

815
01:16:25,374 --> 01:16:28,418
- The terror of lkhwan surpassed The horrors...

816
01:16:28,418 --> 01:16:30,087
Kashmir has seen before.

817
01:16:32,756 --> 01:16:35,759
- It was Khuram who killed your father.

818
01:16:41,181 --> 01:16:45,811
- The army crackdown in your village
was not a matter of chance.

819
01:16:46,019 --> 01:16:48,313
- Khurram was the army's informer...

820
01:16:49,064 --> 01:16:53,193
- and your mother Ghazala was Khurram's

821
01:16:54,361 --> 01:16:57,447
- It is certain. We shall witness...

822
01:16:57,739 --> 01:17:03,203
The promised day...

823
01:17:03,829 --> 01:17:08,834
the day of the blessed word...

824
01:17:09,918 --> 01:17:13,130
We shall witness...

825
01:17:17,009 --> 01:17:17,926
Roohdaar...

826
01:17:18,927 --> 01:17:19,970
Yes.

827
01:17:20,596 --> 01:17:22,973
If you do make it out alive...

828
01:17:23,974 --> 01:17:26,643
Convey my message.

829
01:17:26,643 --> 01:17:27,936
To whom?

830
01:17:30,147 --> 01:17:32,316
To my son, Haider.

831
01:17:33,859 --> 01:17:37,070
Tell him to avenge my betrayal...

832
01:17:38,113 --> 01:17:39,823
by my brother.

833
01:17:42,075 --> 01:17:46,288
Tell him to aim his bullets at those
cunning, deceiving eyes...

834
01:17:47,497 --> 01:17:51,126
that entrapped his mother...

835
01:17:53,128 --> 01:17:58,050
that made him an orphan.

836
01:18:01,011 --> 01:18:02,346
And his mother?

837
01:18:05,098 --> 01:18:08,352
God will be herjudge.

838
01:18:16,109 --> 01:18:19,446
We had become a burden
for everyone...

839
01:18:20,364 --> 01:18:24,868
They handed us over
to the lkhwan.

840
01:18:39,132 --> 01:18:41,677
It was a miracle!

841
01:18:42,928 --> 01:18:46,807
The rope that bound us
came loose...

842
01:18:47,057 --> 01:18:55,023
The icy water of the Jhelum
stopped my bleeding.

843
01:18:56,274 --> 01:19:00,445
Sand-miners on the
river bank saved me.

844
01:19:02,447 --> 01:19:05,492
A few days later, they found
the doctor's body.

845
01:19:07,202 --> 01:19:13,375
A little ahead of Baramulla, at Boniyar village
there is a graveyard...

846
01:19:18,463 --> 01:19:24,678
where the unknown dead are buried.

847
01:19:25,554 --> 01:19:27,931
They buried your father there...

848
01:19:27,931 --> 01:19:29,933
he rests in grave number 318.

849
01:19:42,446 --> 01:19:44,239
This is the safety lock.

850
01:19:46,283 --> 01:19:48,076
Shoot him at point blank.

851
01:19:48,076 --> 01:19:49,953
And remember...

852
01:19:49,953 --> 01:19:54,624
aim at the eyes
that entrapped your mother.

853
01:19:58,336 --> 01:20:01,047
Those treacherous eyes
that orphaned you.

854
01:21:27,843 --> 01:21:30,303
Father...

855
01:22:07,841 --> 01:22:11,386
Who are you calling
so early in the morning?

856
01:22:11,928 --> 01:22:13,889
I had a nightmare.

857
01:22:15,724 --> 01:22:16,975
What was it about?

858
01:22:27,152 --> 01:22:28,028
Haider?

859
01:22:30,113 --> 01:22:32,908
Two days and no word of him.

860
01:22:33,742 --> 01:22:37,287
Neither Arshee nor
the Salmans know...

861
01:22:37,287 --> 01:22:38,955
My dearest...

862
01:22:39,539 --> 01:22:40,957
He's not a child anymore.

863
01:22:41,499 --> 01:22:43,043
He'll be back.

864
01:22:45,545 --> 01:22:49,007
I bumped into the principal
of your school yesterday.

865
01:22:49,841 --> 01:22:53,053
He wanted to know when
you are returning to teach.

866
01:22:54,262 --> 01:22:56,806
The children miss you very much...

867
01:22:57,724 --> 01:23:00,018
Once I become whole.

868
01:23:00,018 --> 01:23:02,103
What are you now? Half?

869
01:23:02,562 --> 01:23:07,150
I am half-widow and half-bride.

870
01:23:07,525 --> 01:23:09,736
You are half a fool as well.

871
01:23:26,211 --> 01:23:27,379
Roohdaar!

872
01:23:33,093 --> 01:23:36,805
- This is the number he called.

873
01:23:36,972 --> 01:23:38,181
It is a satellite phone.

874
01:23:38,181 --> 01:23:39,516
It can't be traced.

875
01:23:46,856 --> 01:23:49,234
Sir, you had mentioned about
a permanent job for us...

876
01:23:49,401 --> 01:23:51,111
another time perhaps...

877
01:24:03,748 --> 01:24:05,875
Miss, your gift is ready...

878
01:24:05,875 --> 01:24:07,127
- Thank you.
- You are welcome...

879
01:24:21,307 --> 01:24:23,601
Daddy! is this a snowman?

880
01:24:23,852 --> 01:24:24,602
No...

881
01:24:24,978 --> 01:24:26,438
This is your husband.

882
01:24:28,023 --> 01:24:29,524
Do you like his nose?

883
01:24:30,233 --> 01:24:31,693
Or shall I cut it a bit?

884
01:24:34,904 --> 01:24:36,614
What is that?

885
01:24:38,533 --> 01:24:39,492
A surprise.

886
01:24:40,035 --> 01:24:41,036
Oh.

887
01:24:48,460 --> 01:24:50,962
Oh... God.

888
01:24:51,629 --> 01:24:54,424
When did...

889
01:24:54,424 --> 01:24:55,800
When did you weave it?

890
01:24:59,054 --> 01:25:01,347
My sweet child.

891
01:25:03,558 --> 01:25:04,851
Here, have one more.

892
01:25:04,851 --> 01:25:07,103
It took a lot to make this for you.

893
01:25:07,312 --> 01:25:09,564
No daddy. I'm not hungry.

894
01:25:10,857 --> 01:25:14,944
He's not going to return
sooner if you stop eating.

895
01:25:17,238 --> 01:25:19,574
Who brought him the message?

896
01:25:22,869 --> 01:25:24,120
Roohdaar?

897
01:25:29,751 --> 01:25:30,752
Open your mouth.

898
01:25:35,799 --> 01:25:38,384
We'll have to take care of Haider...

899
01:25:40,720 --> 01:25:41,554
Together.

900
01:25:45,433 --> 01:25:48,061
Don't hide anything from me.

901
01:26:12,043 --> 01:26:13,044
What is going on?

902
01:26:13,545 --> 01:26:15,380
A traffic jam at the square...

903
01:26:39,070 --> 01:26:39,904
Hello...

904
01:26:40,613 --> 01:26:44,033
Hello...
mic testing one, two, three...

905
01:26:44,701 --> 01:26:46,452
Can you hear me?

906
01:26:46,452 --> 01:26:47,537
Hello...

907
01:26:51,416 --> 01:26:55,170
UN council
resolution number 47 of 1948...

908
01:26:55,545 --> 01:26:59,799
article 2 of the Geneva convention
and article 370 of the Indian constitution...

909
01:27:00,175 --> 01:27:01,885
Raises but one question!

910
01:27:03,303 --> 01:27:04,679
Haider...
- What?

911
01:27:05,263 --> 01:27:06,890
Do we exist or do we not?

912
01:27:08,433 --> 01:27:10,059
If we do... then who are we?

913
01:27:10,059 --> 01:27:12,020
If not... then where are we?

914
01:27:13,938 --> 01:27:14,814
Did we exist at all?

915
01:27:14,814 --> 01:27:16,107
Or not?

916
01:27:17,108 --> 01:27:19,194
Chutzpah is our problem.

917
01:27:19,652 --> 01:27:21,446
Do you know what chutzpah means?

918
01:27:21,821 --> 01:27:24,240
Once upon a time a bank was robbed.

919
01:27:24,782 --> 01:27:26,159
Pointing the gun at the cashier...

920
01:27:26,159 --> 01:27:28,620
the burglar threatened...
give me the money or die..

921
01:27:28,620 --> 01:27:30,538
The cashier gave him all the money.

922
01:27:30,955 --> 01:27:33,833
He went to the next counter...

923
01:27:35,335 --> 01:27:38,254
And asked the man to
open an account for him.

924
01:27:42,342 --> 01:27:45,303
That is chutzpah...

925
01:27:46,054 --> 01:27:49,015
Such audacity, such stupidity..
like AFSPA...

926
01:27:49,641 --> 01:27:52,435
You carry on... I'll fetch him...

927
01:27:52,435 --> 01:27:53,269
AFS PA...

928
01:27:53,895 --> 01:27:55,021
Attention!

929
01:27:55,021 --> 01:27:57,774
Armed Forces Special Powers Act,
section 5, rule 4, point A...

930
01:27:57,774 --> 01:27:59,400
Any commissioned officer...
Yes sir!

931
01:27:59,400 --> 01:28:00,860
Warrant officer...
Yes sir!

932
01:28:00,860 --> 01:28:02,403
Non-commissioned officer...
Yes sir!

933
01:28:02,403 --> 01:28:06,074
Or any other person of equivalent rank
in the armed forces may, in a disturbed area...

934
01:28:06,074 --> 01:28:09,619
if he is of the opinion that it is necessary
so to do for the maintenance of public order...

935
01:28:09,619 --> 01:28:12,205
after giving such due warning as
he may consider necessary...

936
01:28:12,205 --> 01:28:16,000
fire upon or otherwise use force,
even to the causing of death...

937
01:28:19,712 --> 01:28:24,676
Against anyone acting in
contravention with law or order.

938
01:28:25,718 --> 01:28:27,804
Law and order...

939
01:28:29,722 --> 01:28:32,934
Law and order...

940
01:28:32,934 --> 01:28:34,686
Order order...
- Law and order...

941
01:28:34,936 --> 01:28:36,562
There is no law,
there is no order.

942
01:28:36,562 --> 01:28:38,189
Whose laws? Whose order?

943
01:28:38,189 --> 01:28:38,982
Made on order...

944
01:28:38,982 --> 01:28:39,899
Law and order...

945
01:28:39,899 --> 01:28:43,486
India! Pakistan!
A game on the border.

946
01:28:43,903 --> 01:28:46,030
India clings to us..

947
01:28:46,030 --> 01:28:47,448
Pakistan leeches on...

948
01:28:48,283 --> 01:28:50,743
What of us? What do we want?

949
01:28:50,743 --> 01:28:51,661
Freedom!

950
01:28:51,661 --> 01:28:53,496
Freedom from this side...
- Freedom!

951
01:28:53,496 --> 01:28:55,039
Freedom from that side...
- Freedom!

952
01:28:55,039 --> 01:28:57,083
We will be free!
- Freedom!

953
01:28:58,543 --> 01:28:59,752
Haider!

954
01:29:02,463 --> 01:29:09,846
"A world better than the world,
our lndia..."

955
01:29:09,846 --> 01:29:11,723
"We are her children..."

956
01:29:11,723 --> 01:29:12,515
Haider...

957
01:29:13,683 --> 01:29:14,267
Yes?

958
01:29:17,228 --> 01:29:18,396
Mother...
- What?

959
01:29:19,939 --> 01:29:21,649
Mother...
- Whose?

960
01:29:22,567 --> 01:29:23,359
Yours...

961
01:29:23,359 --> 01:29:25,403
Mine... yes...

962
01:29:32,410 --> 01:29:34,329
Mother...

963
01:29:34,329 --> 01:29:35,872
When did you come?

964
01:29:36,539 --> 01:29:38,082
Why are you crying?

965
01:29:38,291 --> 01:29:40,168
There's good news for you.

966
01:29:40,418 --> 01:29:41,753
Nobody will call
you a half-widow now...

967
01:29:42,712 --> 01:29:44,255
Father is dead.

968
01:29:45,006 --> 01:29:46,007
He is dead.

969
01:29:48,551 --> 01:29:50,595
I found his grave.

970
01:29:51,512 --> 01:29:54,849
No more hidden musicals.

971
01:29:58,102 --> 01:29:59,937
You don't believe me, right?

972
01:29:59,937 --> 01:30:01,522
Hang on...

973
01:30:01,522 --> 01:30:03,024
I have a photograph...

974
01:30:04,609 --> 01:30:06,444
My dead father...

975
01:30:06,444 --> 01:30:07,695
Mother...

976
01:30:07,987 --> 01:30:09,280
Look at this.

977
01:30:12,075 --> 01:30:13,159
Mother...

978
01:30:56,160 --> 01:30:58,204
I couldn't find my brother.

979
01:31:00,289 --> 01:31:02,458
But I have found his killer.

980
01:31:05,795 --> 01:31:10,716
He shared his cell at MAMA-2.

981
01:31:11,676 --> 01:31:14,178
He goes by the name Roohdaar...

982
01:31:16,389 --> 01:31:18,850
No one knows his real name.

983
01:31:19,434 --> 01:31:23,312
Every identity of
his is a ghost identity.

984
01:31:24,230 --> 01:31:27,108
He came from Pakistan in 1990.

985
01:31:27,608 --> 01:31:28,776
An lSl agent.

986
01:31:31,404 --> 01:31:35,533
Two years back, he was
arrested in Baramulla.

987
01:31:36,451 --> 01:31:38,995
He cut a deal with the Indian army...

988
01:31:38,995 --> 01:31:43,583
He penetrated Zahoor's group...
A double agent...

989
01:31:48,004 --> 01:31:51,883
My brother got to know that.

990
01:31:55,887 --> 01:31:59,640
Which is why he negotiated...

991
01:32:00,600 --> 01:32:03,269
his release as well.

992
01:32:05,188 --> 01:32:07,023
On the way out...

993
01:32:07,732 --> 01:32:10,026
he...

994
01:32:10,026 --> 01:32:13,571
He... killed him...

995
01:32:19,076 --> 01:32:21,370
and pushed him into
the Jhelum river...

996
01:32:21,579 --> 01:32:25,416
These people have killed my brother.

997
01:32:26,083 --> 01:32:30,129
Until I avenge his death...

998
01:32:32,715 --> 01:32:34,509
I will not rest...

999
01:32:36,427 --> 01:32:37,261
I promise you...

1000
01:32:38,763 --> 01:32:39,388
Haider...

1001
01:32:44,060 --> 01:32:45,353
Haider...

1002
01:32:47,813 --> 01:32:50,316
Come in, little princess...

1003
01:33:05,706 --> 01:33:06,624
Hello.

1004
01:33:07,458 --> 01:33:08,793
Hello.

1005
01:33:11,379 --> 01:33:13,297
What an imbecile you are!

1006
01:33:13,297 --> 01:33:14,882
You disappear for days!

1007
01:33:14,882 --> 01:33:17,134
You don't even tell
me when you are back.

1008
01:33:17,426 --> 01:33:19,929
I worry for you in vain.

1009
01:33:23,933 --> 01:33:25,434
You are so haggard...

1010
01:33:27,770 --> 01:33:30,856
Why don't you find me a cure!

1011
01:37:39,355 --> 01:37:41,816
Everyone doubts you are going mad.

1012
01:37:45,277 --> 01:37:48,239
I trust my doubts but...

1013
01:37:48,447 --> 01:37:50,825
doubt my trusts.

1014
01:37:53,202 --> 01:37:54,370
What do you mean?

1015
01:37:55,204 --> 01:37:56,038
I mean...

1016
01:37:58,541 --> 01:38:01,752
ls Roohdaar the brave,
beloved witness?

1017
01:38:02,336 --> 01:38:05,172
Is Khurram the master of falsehood?

1018
01:38:05,840 --> 01:38:08,175
Whose tells a conceited tale?

1019
01:38:08,884 --> 01:38:11,804
Whose bears the cross of truth?

1020
01:38:12,805 --> 01:38:15,266
To believe or not to believe.

1021
01:38:16,183 --> 01:38:18,269
That is the question...

1022
01:38:19,436 --> 01:38:24,358
The answer hides
in yet another question.

1023
01:38:32,449 --> 01:38:33,367
What is that?

1024
01:38:37,997 --> 01:38:41,333
To trust the surging
beats of the heart...

1025
01:38:41,625 --> 01:38:45,337
Or to heed the caution
of sober mind...

1026
01:38:45,629 --> 01:38:49,008
To kill or to die..

1027
01:38:50,676 --> 01:38:54,013
To be or not to be.

1028
01:38:57,266 --> 01:38:58,726
Where did you get this?

1029
01:38:59,101 --> 01:38:59,977
Give it back...

1030
01:39:01,437 --> 01:39:02,021
Haider...

1031
01:39:03,898 --> 01:39:05,816
You will do no such thing.

1032
01:39:06,942 --> 01:39:08,861
Whether it's the truth or a lie...

1033
01:39:13,574 --> 01:39:14,658
Swear upon me.

1034
01:39:17,494 --> 01:39:19,705
I have lovvedd you more than my life.

1035
01:39:28,297 --> 01:39:30,591
Not lovvedd, it's loved...

1036
01:39:31,216 --> 01:39:32,927
The V and D softly.

1037
01:39:32,927 --> 01:39:34,345
Say it... loved.

1038
01:39:35,721 --> 01:39:36,680
Lowe-d.

1039
01:39:38,015 --> 01:39:39,016
Say.. Kicked.

1040
01:39:39,600 --> 01:39:40,309
Kick-ked.

1041
01:39:40,309 --> 01:39:41,560
Plucked.
- Pluck-ked.

1042
01:39:41,852 --> 01:39:42,686
Sucked...

1043
01:39:42,686 --> 01:39:43,479
Suck-ked...

1044
01:39:43,479 --> 01:39:44,271
F****

1045
01:39:44,271 --> 01:39:44,813
Fu...

1046
01:39:48,901 --> 01:39:50,903
'Baster-ed'...
- 'Baster-ed'...

1047
01:40:16,887 --> 01:40:25,187
Thank you for being with us
in this time of grief.

1048
01:40:25,938 --> 01:40:33,153
Somehow I have gathered myself
to bear this bitter loss but...

1049
01:40:34,154 --> 01:40:36,657
the thought of seeing my beloved
sister-in-law live a widow's life...

1050
01:40:36,657 --> 01:40:39,535
and my dearest Haider as an orphan...

1051
01:40:40,244 --> 01:40:43,455
How do I find the courage
to bear that?

1052
01:40:44,873 --> 01:40:49,378
And thus facing these facts,
I seek your permission...

1053
01:40:49,378 --> 01:40:53,007
My elders and friends
present here, allow me...

1054
01:40:54,675 --> 01:40:58,887
to marry my sister-in-law
Ghazala Meer...

1055
01:40:59,888 --> 01:41:03,058
God bless!
- God bless!

1056
01:41:41,764 --> 01:41:42,848
Father...

1057
01:41:42,848 --> 01:41:44,975
My father-to-be...

1058
01:41:59,198 --> 01:42:01,909
Go on.. feed this fellow..

1059
01:42:12,878 --> 01:42:15,005
Mother...
- My angel...

1060
01:42:17,174 --> 01:42:19,468
What is this?

1061
01:42:19,885 --> 01:42:22,179
When will you grow up?
- Never...

1062
01:42:22,554 --> 01:42:23,597
What is this?

1063
01:42:27,643 --> 01:42:31,438
Remember what you would say
when you were a child?

1064
01:42:31,438 --> 01:42:32,397
What?

1065
01:42:32,815 --> 01:42:35,609
"When I grow up I'm going
to marry my mommy."

1066
01:42:38,320 --> 01:42:41,448
You would snuggle between
your father and me.

1067
01:42:43,951 --> 01:42:47,955
Even if he touched me,
you would fight with him.

1068
01:42:49,790 --> 01:42:52,042
And now his brother touches you...

1069
01:42:53,919 --> 01:42:55,754
What should I do now?

1070
01:43:01,677 --> 01:43:04,888
Who would want to share
you with the world?

1071
01:43:14,523 --> 01:43:16,608
Your beauty is venomous.

1072
01:43:59,109 --> 01:44:04,907
They have given him a pistol...

1073
01:44:05,574 --> 01:44:07,201
to kill uncle Khurram...

1074
01:44:24,009 --> 01:44:25,427
- Ghazala Akhtar...

1075
01:44:25,427 --> 01:44:36,480
Do you accept Khurram Hussain Meer
as your lawfully married husband?

1076
01:44:38,357 --> 01:44:39,316
I do.

1077
01:44:39,650 --> 01:44:40,609
- Do you accept?

1078
01:44:42,027 --> 01:44:42,861
I do.

1079
01:44:43,153 --> 01:44:44,196
- Do you accept?

1080
01:44:45,197 --> 01:44:46,156
I do.

1081
01:44:47,324 --> 01:44:50,535
- Khurram Hussain Meer...

1082
01:44:50,535 --> 01:44:55,832
do you accept Ghazala Akhtar
as your lawfully married wife?

1083
01:44:55,832 --> 01:44:56,917
I do.

1084
01:45:13,934 --> 01:45:18,146
0 nightingale's heart,
0 wounded bird

1085
01:45:18,146 --> 01:45:21,817
Stay away, stay away,
don't meet the flower

1086
01:45:22,192 --> 01:45:26,280
0 nightingale's heart,
0 wounded bird

1087
01:45:26,655 --> 01:45:30,325
Stay away, stay away,
don't meet the flower

1088
01:45:35,080 --> 01:45:39,084
A heart in conflict is in
difficulty indeed

1089
01:45:39,251 --> 01:45:42,296
If the heart is pounding,
the heart is pounding

1090
01:45:43,630 --> 01:45:45,757
If the heart is pounding,
the heart is pounding

1091
01:45:45,757 --> 01:45:49,219
Then a pounding heart
can be wicked too

1092
01:45:50,012 --> 01:45:54,016
The flower's scent
is filled with poison

1093
01:45:54,266 --> 01:45:56,393
Stay away, stay away,
don't meet the flower

1094
01:45:56,393 --> 01:45:58,145
0 nightingale's heart

1095
01:45:58,520 --> 01:46:00,564
Stay away, stay away,
don't meet the flower

1096
01:46:00,564 --> 01:46:02,607
0 nightingale's heart

1097
01:46:38,977 --> 01:46:42,439
Listen, O world,
I want to speak

1098
01:46:43,148 --> 01:46:45,776
Your story again
I wish to repeat

1099
01:46:47,194 --> 01:46:51,406
0 nightingale's heart,
0 wounded bird

1100
01:46:55,494 --> 01:46:59,706
There was a pair of birds,
A male and female

1101
01:46:59,706 --> 01:47:03,794
The female was innocent,
The male was simple

1102
01:47:04,086 --> 01:47:08,340
There was a pair of birds,
A male and female

1103
01:47:08,340 --> 01:47:12,302
The female was innocent,
The male was simple

1104
01:47:12,844 --> 01:47:17,099
When the mountains
Were covered with snow

1105
01:47:18,975 --> 01:47:21,770
A falcon of bad intention

1106
01:47:23,188 --> 01:47:25,357
A falcon of bad intention

1107
01:47:25,357 --> 01:47:29,528
Flew above the trees and forest

1108
01:47:29,903 --> 01:47:34,116
Death lurked within its folded wings

1109
01:47:34,116 --> 01:47:38,036
Searching to find
A palace's destination

1110
01:47:38,328 --> 01:47:42,290
Searching to find
A palace's destination

1111
01:47:59,558 --> 01:48:03,311
It found a home in
the nightingale's dreams

1112
01:48:03,895 --> 01:48:07,941
And stung them with lethal venom

1113
01:48:07,941 --> 01:48:12,237
Put poison in the scented flowers

1114
01:48:12,237 --> 01:48:16,450
Send to the nightingale in question.

1115
01:48:16,700 --> 01:48:19,035
And stung them with lethal venom

1116
01:48:19,035 --> 01:48:20,996
It found a home in
the nightingale's dreams

1117
01:48:20,996 --> 01:48:23,039
Send to the nightingale in question.

1118
01:48:23,039 --> 01:48:25,208
And stung them with lethal venom

1119
01:48:27,419 --> 01:48:29,504
He sprinkled gun powder in the valley

1120
01:48:29,504 --> 01:48:31,631
Below the lake put snares in sway

1121
01:48:31,631 --> 01:48:35,552
Dangling daggers against the male

1122
01:48:35,927 --> 01:48:38,013
Dangling daggers against the male

1123
01:48:38,013 --> 01:48:41,600
Cut the bird's wings away

1124
01:48:42,017 --> 01:48:46,396
0 heart, my heart, my heart,
Only cowards lie

1125
01:48:46,605 --> 01:48:50,734
0 nightingale's heart,
0 wounded bird

1126
01:48:51,234 --> 01:48:56,698
0 nightingale's heart,
0 wounded bird

1127
01:49:16,801 --> 01:49:23,225
He had the injured man imprisoned

1128
01:49:25,852 --> 01:49:30,982
And tied him up like a slave

1129
01:49:32,651 --> 01:49:37,572
Took him to the Jhelum bridge

1130
01:49:39,658 --> 01:49:44,329
And threw him to a watery grave

1131
01:49:48,917 --> 01:49:52,963
Jhelum, Jhelum...

1132
01:49:53,255 --> 01:49:57,300
Red, your colour is red

1133
01:49:57,551 --> 01:50:01,888
Jhelum, Jhelum...

1134
01:50:01,888 --> 01:50:05,934
Red, your colour is red

1135
01:50:10,188 --> 01:50:14,192
But the river's of Kashmir
Have their unique essence

1136
01:50:14,693 --> 01:50:18,655
The chains broke,
As did destiny's tide

1137
01:50:18,905 --> 01:50:22,659
He's alive, he will be living

1138
01:50:23,076 --> 01:50:26,329
The criminal now cannot hide

1139
01:50:27,289 --> 01:50:29,499
He's alive, he will be living

1140
01:50:29,499 --> 01:50:31,710
The criminal now cannot hide

1141
01:50:38,091 --> 01:50:46,266
Come to your senses,
lover's nightingale

1142
01:50:46,266 --> 01:50:50,729
The flower's scent
is filled with poison

1143
01:50:50,729 --> 01:50:54,399
Come to your senses,
lover's nightingale

1144
01:50:54,941 --> 01:50:58,987
Come to your senses,
lover's nightingale

1145
01:51:25,847 --> 01:51:28,141
Such a brilliant story!

1146
01:51:29,309 --> 01:51:30,268
- Who wrote This play?

1147
01:51:31,436 --> 01:51:34,439
Zahoor Hussain?
Or was it Roohdaar?

1148
01:51:37,317 --> 01:51:39,611
Didn't they give you a gun too?

1149
01:51:41,154 --> 01:51:42,530
To kill me?

1150
01:51:52,207 --> 01:51:54,876
What shall we do Ghazala?

1151
01:51:56,169 --> 01:51:57,796
Die by his bullet?

1152
01:51:59,631 --> 01:52:01,132
Or have him treated?

1153
01:52:04,010 --> 01:52:05,220
In an asylum.

1154
01:52:07,055 --> 01:52:08,014
Don't let him get away...

1155
01:52:08,014 --> 01:52:08,807
- Haider...

1156
01:52:08,807 --> 01:52:09,683
Catch him...

1157
01:52:09,683 --> 01:52:10,850
- Haider...

1158
01:52:15,939 --> 01:52:18,608
- Follow him... come on...

1159
01:52:39,254 --> 01:52:42,424
It's Post Traumatic
Stress Disorder...

1160
01:52:42,424 --> 01:52:43,842
- PTSD.

1161
01:52:43,842 --> 01:52:46,302
He needs psychiatric care.

1162
01:52:46,678 --> 01:52:48,513
I've had a word at the hospital.

1163
01:52:48,513 --> 01:52:51,349
We'll admit him in the
morning after curfew.

1164
01:52:51,891 --> 01:52:55,019
If he wakes up,
he'll make a run for it.

1165
01:52:55,770 --> 01:52:57,522
I have sedated him well.

1166
01:52:57,522 --> 01:52:59,315
He won't wake up for hours.

1167
01:53:02,152 --> 01:53:06,197
There's a curfew out there,
I'll drop you in my car.

1168
01:53:06,197 --> 01:53:08,491
Okay, thank you.
- Come on.

1169
01:53:33,683 --> 01:53:34,434
Arshee...

1170
01:53:35,351 --> 01:53:36,144
Arshee...

1171
01:53:36,728 --> 01:53:37,812
Open the door...

1172
01:53:39,022 --> 01:53:40,732
You misunderstand me.

1173
01:53:42,025 --> 01:53:42,859
No!

1174
01:53:44,569 --> 01:53:46,237
You have betrayed me.

1175
01:53:46,863 --> 01:53:48,782
You took advantage of my trust.

1176
01:53:48,782 --> 01:53:49,908
You used me...

1177
01:53:52,368 --> 01:53:55,997
You don't care for Haider's life...

1178
01:53:56,581 --> 01:53:59,375
You want to use him to
catch those people...

1179
01:53:59,375 --> 01:54:01,127
who exposed Khurram.

1180
01:54:03,004 --> 01:54:09,552
You don't care if Haider has to die.

1181
01:54:12,055 --> 01:54:15,225
Open the door and let me explain...

1182
01:54:15,767 --> 01:54:18,102
Try to see my point

1183
01:54:18,102 --> 01:54:20,814
I don't want to get your point..

1184
01:54:20,814 --> 01:54:23,983
I don't want to see you... ever!

1185
01:55:04,524 --> 01:55:05,441
Haider...

1186
01:55:09,529 --> 01:55:11,739
Avenge me...

1187
01:55:13,658 --> 01:55:14,909
of my brother.

1188
01:55:18,580 --> 01:55:22,500
Aim bullets at those
cunning, deceiving eyes...

1189
01:55:23,209 --> 01:55:26,504
that entrapped your mother...

1190
01:55:29,257 --> 01:55:30,967
Don't forget...

1191
01:57:08,314 --> 01:57:09,691
My Lord...

1192
01:57:13,403 --> 01:57:17,490
my crime, my sin stinks...

1193
01:57:22,036 --> 01:57:25,373
- I'm drowning in guilt.

1194
01:57:25,373 --> 01:57:30,878
- My soul reeks of my brother's blood...

1195
01:57:30,878 --> 01:57:33,423
Wash me clean...

1196
01:57:33,423 --> 01:57:36,175
with the rain of your mercy, My Lord!

1197
01:57:40,722 --> 01:57:43,141
Bereave me of all you bestowed...

1198
01:57:47,895 --> 01:57:51,524
All the wealth, all the power,
all the fame...

1199
01:57:52,734 --> 01:57:55,611
Everything...

1200
01:57:56,237 --> 01:58:00,366
- Let The rain of your mercy...

1201
01:58:01,534 --> 01:58:04,037
cleanse me, my Lord!

1202
01:58:16,716 --> 01:58:17,467
Haider...

1203
01:58:18,718 --> 01:58:19,719
What are you doing?

1204
01:58:21,137 --> 01:58:22,138
- Haider...

1205
01:58:23,181 --> 01:58:24,307
Give me the pistol...

1206
01:58:25,391 --> 01:58:26,476
Do as I say...

1207
01:58:27,351 --> 01:58:28,436
Give me the pistol...

1208
01:58:28,436 --> 01:58:29,062
- Haider...

1209
01:58:30,521 --> 01:58:31,564
Grab him...

1210
01:58:32,607 --> 01:58:33,775
Hold his hands...

1211
01:58:36,235 --> 01:58:37,528
Show me your hands...

1212
01:58:39,947 --> 01:58:40,907
What are you doing?

1213
01:58:40,907 --> 01:58:41,783
- Let go of him...

1214
01:58:42,992 --> 01:58:43,618
- Let go of him...

1215
01:58:43,618 --> 01:58:46,204
We caught him in time...
or he might have...

1216
01:58:46,204 --> 01:58:49,916
I didn't kill you for
you were in prayer...

1217
01:58:50,249 --> 01:58:54,295
Even a ghastly sinner would enter
heaven if killed in prayer.

1218
01:58:54,879 --> 01:58:57,465
Haider...
you have really gone insane!

1219
01:58:57,465 --> 01:58:58,591
Take him away...

1220
01:58:58,591 --> 01:59:01,969
I will kill you...
when you are in sin...

1221
01:59:01,969 --> 01:59:03,387
not when you are in prayer...

1222
01:59:04,639 --> 01:59:07,433
I'll aim my bullets at
your treacherous eyes, Khurram...

1223
01:59:07,433 --> 01:59:10,520
those deceitful eyes that
entrapped my mother.

1224
01:59:11,229 --> 01:59:13,356
I will aim my bullets
at your treacherous eyes...

1225
01:59:13,356 --> 01:59:16,192
those deceitful eyes that
entrapped my mother...

1226
01:59:22,657 --> 01:59:23,491
Move it...

1227
01:59:29,497 --> 01:59:30,331
Step inside.

1228
01:59:41,384 --> 01:59:42,760
Shoot from a distance...

1229
01:59:43,219 --> 01:59:44,846
And shoot him on the back.

1230
02:00:12,707 --> 02:00:13,541
Wake-up!

1231
02:00:13,541 --> 02:00:14,167
Wake-up?

1232
02:00:14,167 --> 02:00:15,001
Wake-up you idiot!

1233
02:00:16,627 --> 02:00:18,045
Take out your gun!

1234
02:00:19,589 --> 02:00:20,506
Watch out!

1235
02:00:47,700 --> 02:00:51,245
Haider don't!
We'll do as you say...

1236
02:00:51,621 --> 02:00:53,331
Free my hands.

1237
02:00:53,331 --> 02:00:54,498
Okay.

1238
02:00:56,751 --> 02:00:58,169
It is not my fault...

1239
02:00:58,169 --> 02:00:59,003
He told them everything...

1240
02:00:59,212 --> 02:01:00,213
He's lying!

1241
02:01:00,213 --> 02:01:01,422
He's lying!
It is not my fault...

1242
02:01:01,672 --> 02:01:02,590
It was all his fault...

1243
02:01:02,590 --> 02:01:03,716
Why are you lying?!

1244
02:01:04,967 --> 02:01:05,718
Darn!

1245
02:01:07,595 --> 02:01:08,804
Grab the gun... Quick!

1246
02:01:17,188 --> 02:01:18,022
Want some of this?

1247
02:01:23,861 --> 02:01:24,987
Chutzpah!

1248
02:01:25,238 --> 02:01:25,947
Run...

1249
02:01:30,117 --> 02:01:31,452
Run...

1250
02:01:31,452 --> 02:01:32,036
Run Salman, run!

1251
02:01:35,456 --> 02:01:36,499
Up... Salman!

1252
02:01:37,625 --> 02:01:38,751
Watch out!

1253
02:01:49,887 --> 02:01:51,055
Salman!

1254
02:01:53,474 --> 02:01:55,601
Salman!

1255
02:02:48,779 --> 02:02:49,613
- Hello...

1256
02:02:50,197 --> 02:02:51,324
- Khurram is still alive.

1257
02:02:51,657 --> 02:02:53,159
- But I've killed three cops.

1258
02:02:53,159 --> 02:02:54,535
I heard...

1259
02:02:54,827 --> 02:02:55,911
Where are you now?

1260
02:02:55,911 --> 02:02:57,204
On the Pampore highway.

1261
02:02:57,455 --> 02:02:58,372
Stay on the line.

1262
02:02:59,707 --> 02:03:01,125
It's the doctor's son...

1263
02:03:05,087 --> 02:03:06,130
Send him across the border...

1264
02:03:09,133 --> 02:03:11,218
You'll need go across
the border for training.

1265
02:03:12,136 --> 02:03:14,930
Get to the graveyard
where we met first.

1266
02:03:15,139 --> 02:03:16,432
- We'll get in touch...

1267
02:03:16,891 --> 02:03:17,808
Alright.

1268
02:03:18,434 --> 02:03:19,477
Bye.

1269
02:03:33,491 --> 02:03:34,450
Hello.

1270
02:03:35,534 --> 02:03:37,703
Hello...

1271
02:03:48,756 --> 02:03:50,257
Hello Haider...

1272
02:03:54,387 --> 02:03:56,597
Where are you?
In the hospital?

1273
02:03:57,640 --> 02:03:59,683
- Haider...

1274
02:04:00,559 --> 02:04:03,604
There were other ways to part...

1275
02:04:06,941 --> 02:04:09,360
Why did you have
to get my father killed?

1276
02:04:09,985 --> 02:04:11,737
God!

1277
02:04:13,489 --> 02:04:15,032
This is not true!

1278
02:04:15,783 --> 02:04:17,868
I swear upon God...
this is not true!

1279
02:04:24,500 --> 02:04:26,001
I'm going mother.

1280
02:04:27,128 --> 02:04:28,003
Where?

1281
02:04:32,049 --> 02:04:34,301
You're crossing the border?

1282
02:04:40,558 --> 02:04:43,936
It is a fatal trek..
I won't bear losing you..

1283
02:04:51,110 --> 02:04:55,114
At least, meet me once...
I won't stop you this time.

1284
02:04:55,114 --> 02:04:55,906
I promise...

1285
02:04:56,407 --> 02:04:58,242
- Meet me once.

1286
02:05:01,704 --> 02:05:03,998
Meet me once.

1287
02:05:54,340 --> 02:05:56,342
- My two-faced mother.

1288
02:06:01,931 --> 02:06:07,520
Such innocence in one face;
such deceit in the other...

1289
02:06:07,728 --> 02:06:11,398
We are not to be blamed
for the doctor's death

1290
02:06:14,235 --> 02:06:18,197
Oh! How sad to see a mother lie...

1291
02:06:19,448 --> 02:06:22,618
The flowers on father's grave
were still fresh...

1292
02:06:22,618 --> 02:06:24,828
and you rushed into
Khurram's marital bed.

1293
02:06:26,622 --> 02:06:33,546
The world knows you and Khurram
conspired to murder my father.

1294
02:06:34,046 --> 02:06:35,714
These are utter lies...

1295
02:06:41,136 --> 02:06:42,137
Mother...

1296
02:06:44,098 --> 02:06:47,851
lkhlaq was hiding in our
house that fateful day...

1297
02:06:47,851 --> 02:06:49,853
only you knew that.

1298
02:06:51,564 --> 02:06:55,442
Khurram was an informant
for the army...

1299
02:06:55,442 --> 02:06:59,530
and you were his informer.

1300
02:07:13,794 --> 02:07:14,628
Hello.

1301
02:07:14,795 --> 02:07:17,214
You're home?

1302
02:07:18,966 --> 02:07:20,968
Then what's that shining in the sky?

1303
02:07:26,682 --> 02:07:28,642
I'm scared Khurram.

1304
02:07:29,602 --> 02:07:30,311
What happened?

1305
02:07:31,312 --> 02:07:33,856
Hilaal's brought lkhlaq home today.

1306
02:07:35,399 --> 02:07:36,817
Ikhlaq Latif!

1307
02:07:38,861 --> 02:07:42,323
I had no idea that
Khurram was an informant.

1308
02:07:44,116 --> 02:07:47,995
I never wanted to harm
your father.

1309
02:07:50,873 --> 02:07:53,167
I did not hate him.

1310
02:07:58,839 --> 02:08:00,299
And Khurram?

1311
02:08:10,142 --> 02:08:12,102
How did you feel for Khurram?

1312
02:08:30,746 --> 02:08:31,705
Wait...

1313
02:08:31,705 --> 02:08:32,915
Stop the jeep...

1314
02:08:51,141 --> 02:08:53,477
I'll wait eagerly...

1315
02:08:54,478 --> 02:08:56,730
For you to be a widow again.

1316
02:08:59,900 --> 02:09:03,570
My angel, will you do me
one last favor?

1317
02:09:05,656 --> 02:09:07,866
I am tired of my wretched life...

1318
02:09:13,247 --> 02:09:14,289
End my 390m'!

1319
02:09:16,709 --> 02:09:19,253
Your life is your punishment.

1320
02:09:42,901 --> 02:09:45,362
Differentiation is
the unique element...

1321
02:09:45,362 --> 02:09:47,448
It is important to be unique
at something that is...

1322
02:09:47,448 --> 02:09:49,199
valuable to your customers...

1323
02:09:52,536 --> 02:09:54,872
Lakshmi, I told you not to put
any calls through...

1324
02:09:55,456 --> 02:09:56,123
Who?

1325
02:09:58,083 --> 02:09:59,293
Yes, put him through...

1326
02:10:01,253 --> 02:10:02,045
Hello...

1327
02:10:31,617 --> 02:10:33,452
You're equally responsible
for this death...

1328
02:10:37,623 --> 02:10:39,875
Despite everything...

1329
02:10:40,584 --> 02:10:42,544
you went to see him...

1330
02:10:44,797 --> 02:10:46,632
without telling me...

1331
02:10:48,091 --> 02:10:52,221
Your son has crossed over
to the other side...

1332
02:10:56,892 --> 02:10:59,436
He's become a bloodthirsty animal.

1333
02:11:03,023 --> 02:11:05,859
Yes... but atleast
he's not a snake in the grass.

1334
02:12:02,833 --> 02:12:07,796
Where is Haider?
- Liyaqat... calm down.

1335
02:12:07,796 --> 02:12:11,300
Where is he?
- Liyaqat... calm down.

1336
02:12:11,300 --> 02:12:15,304
Wherever he is...
he will not survive.

1337
02:12:23,145 --> 02:12:28,942
I won't stop till
I put him in a coffin.

1338
02:13:42,724 --> 02:13:45,102
Both of them had
guns in their hands...

1339
02:13:46,728 --> 02:13:49,523
If Haider wouldn't
have fired first...

1340
02:13:50,190 --> 02:13:52,609
Parvez would have.

1341
02:14:08,083 --> 02:14:10,127
Everyone wants to kill him.

1342
02:14:13,338 --> 02:14:15,757
I know he won't make it

1343
02:14:37,487 --> 02:14:39,531
The doctor's wife on the line.

1344
02:14:43,243 --> 02:14:44,494
Roohdaar...

1345
02:14:44,745 --> 02:14:46,204
- Who is this?

1346
02:14:46,204 --> 02:14:47,497
Ghazala...

1347
02:14:48,373 --> 02:14:49,666
Ghazala Meer...

1348
02:15:04,556 --> 02:15:06,683
Oh, why don't you come...

1349
02:15:06,683 --> 02:15:08,685
My dearly departed...

1350
02:15:08,685 --> 02:15:10,937
Where you are now...

1351
02:15:10,937 --> 02:15:12,189
Sleep.

1352
02:15:13,148 --> 02:15:15,275
Oh, why don't you come...

1353
02:15:15,275 --> 02:15:17,277
My tired one...

1354
02:15:17,277 --> 02:15:19,196
My life...

1355
02:15:19,196 --> 02:15:20,405
Just sleep.

1356
02:15:21,531 --> 02:15:24,284
Not twilight or sunset...

1357
02:15:25,744 --> 02:15:28,080
Just darkness, only darkness...

1358
02:15:29,915 --> 02:15:32,000
Not twilight or sunset...

1359
02:15:32,000 --> 02:15:34,127
Just darkness, only darkness...

1360
02:15:34,127 --> 02:15:35,879
A nest for your soul...

1361
02:15:35,879 --> 02:15:38,340
So rest, just sleep.

1362
02:15:38,340 --> 02:15:42,886
Oh, why don't you come...

1363
02:15:47,057 --> 02:15:51,228
No one is deep or shallow...
No giants or dwarves here...

1364
02:15:55,440 --> 02:15:59,903
In the nests of a grave...
Only the deep sleep exists...

1365
02:16:01,655 --> 02:16:04,407
No beds, no breakfast...

1366
02:16:05,700 --> 02:16:07,828
No bags, no bagga9e---

1367
02:16:07,828 --> 02:16:10,997
Only an angel's lullaby...
So sleep...

1368
02:16:11,998 --> 02:16:16,545
Oh, why don't you come...

1369
02:16:20,423 --> 02:16:24,970
Come home...

1370
02:16:28,306 --> 02:16:31,017
Haider...
Where have you been?

1371
02:16:31,017 --> 02:16:35,272
We have been waiting for you.

1372
02:16:35,272 --> 02:16:38,650
Dig a grave and rest...

1373
02:16:56,418 --> 02:16:59,921
Grandpa, Why do skulls
keep grinning?

1374
02:16:59,921 --> 02:17:01,548
Your skull will surely
be a brooding one.

1375
02:17:01,548 --> 02:17:02,799
Shut up and eat.

1376
02:17:03,341 --> 02:17:07,012
The dead know they never lived fully.

1377
02:17:08,305 --> 02:17:10,557
And it never stops with death...

1378
02:17:10,557 --> 02:17:11,558
Got it?

1379
02:17:13,476 --> 02:17:15,478
The body turns into soil...

1380
02:17:15,478 --> 02:17:19,149
the soil is,
turned into pots and toys...

1381
02:17:19,149 --> 02:17:22,986
You maybe Alexander or Akbar...
Hitler or Gandhi...

1382
02:17:23,278 --> 02:17:25,071
all that remains is dust.

1383
02:17:26,114 --> 02:17:29,117
Who knows... this flask your grandpa
is serving tea from...

1384
02:17:29,117 --> 02:17:31,536
might be made of some dust
from Alexander's body...

1385
02:17:33,371 --> 02:17:36,082
He may have conquered the world...

1386
02:17:36,082 --> 02:17:39,377
but today he's serving
tea in a graveyard.

1387
02:18:10,492 --> 02:18:11,826
Whose funeral is it?

1388
02:18:14,829 --> 02:18:16,039
A dead person's...

1389
02:18:16,790 --> 02:18:17,874
Will you have some tea?

1390
02:18:28,343 --> 02:18:29,678
Is it a woman's?

1391
02:18:29,678 --> 02:18:32,681
How does it matter?

1392
02:18:32,681 --> 02:18:34,599
Let's go and eat...

1393
02:18:35,392 --> 02:18:36,393
Come along, son...

1394
02:18:36,810 --> 02:18:37,477
Come along.

1395
02:18:39,020 --> 02:18:40,188
- Haider, come now...

1396
02:18:44,651 --> 02:18:45,527
- Haider!

1397
02:18:48,571 --> 02:18:49,406
Arshee...

1398
02:18:50,156 --> 02:18:50,991
- Haider...

1399
02:18:58,206 --> 02:18:58,790
Haider!

1400
02:18:59,457 --> 02:19:00,166
Haider...

1401
02:19:00,750 --> 02:19:03,044
Stop Haider... don't go there...
Listen to me...

1402
02:19:03,461 --> 02:19:05,630
Haider... don't go there...

1403
02:19:05,630 --> 02:19:07,590
They will kill you...

1404
02:19:08,091 --> 02:19:08,883
Haider...

1405
02:19:11,261 --> 02:19:12,095
Arshee...

1406
02:19:15,015 --> 02:19:15,765
Arshee!

1407
02:19:16,474 --> 02:19:17,475
Arshee!

1408
02:19:18,101 --> 02:19:21,646
Arshee!
- Control yourself...

1409
02:20:48,483 --> 02:20:50,276
- Come what may...

1410
02:20:50,527 --> 02:20:52,112
- the boy should live...

1411
02:20:53,405 --> 02:20:55,615
Get out of there now.

1412
02:20:56,408 --> 02:20:58,618
We have too many
weapons Zahoor...

1413
02:20:58,618 --> 02:21:00,203
they won't fit in the car.

1414
02:21:01,204 --> 02:21:03,456
Take whatever you can. Leave!

1415
02:21:03,456 --> 02:21:04,332
Now!

1416
02:21:21,224 --> 02:21:24,727
- Zahoor... it is too late.

1417
02:21:42,620 --> 02:21:43,997
- Liyaqat...

1418
02:22:28,374 --> 02:22:29,292
Muzamil!

1419
02:22:30,960 --> 02:22:32,378
There's a whole battalion inside...

1420
02:22:32,879 --> 02:22:34,172
You said he was alone...

1421
02:22:34,172 --> 02:22:35,381
I didn't know, sir...

1422
02:22:38,927 --> 02:22:39,886
Throw a grenade...

1423
02:23:23,304 --> 02:23:24,389
- Brother...

1424
02:23:25,515 --> 02:23:26,766
- Brother...

1425
02:23:56,546 --> 02:23:59,215
- Bring the rocket launcher here!

1426
02:24:12,979 --> 02:24:14,856
- Rocket launcher loaded!

1427
02:24:16,566 --> 02:24:17,400
Fire...

1428
02:24:17,734 --> 02:24:18,860
Fire!

1429
02:24:28,036 --> 02:24:30,872
You were to fire in the middle!
- Muzamil...

1430
02:24:37,795 --> 02:24:39,881
Take the whole darn house down...

1431
02:24:40,381 --> 02:24:41,507
Yes, sir!

1432
02:24:44,886 --> 02:24:46,095
Load up...

1433
02:24:51,643 --> 02:24:52,894
Loaded, sir!

1434
02:25:09,118 --> 02:25:10,745
What are you doing here?

1435
02:25:13,790 --> 02:25:16,042
Please spare my son.

1436
02:25:18,127 --> 02:25:20,797
I'll get him to surrender...

1437
02:25:35,061 --> 02:25:37,980
If you truly love me,
give me one chance.

1438
02:25:51,452 --> 02:25:52,829
- My angel!

1439
02:25:56,290 --> 02:25:57,792
My angel!

1440
02:26:18,438 --> 02:26:19,897
My angel!

1441
02:26:43,004 --> 02:26:46,799
If you got so much as
a scratch as a child...

1442
02:26:47,884 --> 02:26:50,219
I'd tear apart the world...

1443
02:26:51,929 --> 02:26:56,893
You are now covered in blood and...

1444
02:26:58,436 --> 02:27:01,355
I can't do a thing.

1445
02:27:06,068 --> 02:27:08,488
Mother... I won't surrender.

1446
02:27:11,824 --> 02:27:15,244
Don't you want to see me
as a widow again?

1447
02:27:23,085 --> 02:27:24,879
Angel...

1448
02:27:30,551 --> 02:27:33,930
There's no greater pain...

1449
02:27:34,472 --> 02:27:37,308
than to see the corpse
of your child.

1450
02:27:40,186 --> 02:27:41,562
There is...

1451
02:27:44,398 --> 02:27:48,152
To die without avenging
the murder of one's father.

1452
02:28:00,790 --> 02:28:05,253
Revenge begets revenge...

1453
02:28:06,796 --> 02:28:10,591
Revenge does not set us free...

1454
02:28:11,717 --> 02:28:14,887
Freedom lies beyond revenge.

1455
02:28:15,847 --> 02:28:17,598
True freedom.

1456
02:28:25,940 --> 02:28:30,194
I beg you drop your weapons,
surrender... or else...

1457
02:28:32,238 --> 02:28:33,573
Or else?

1458
02:28:36,909 --> 02:28:38,536
You won't live through it?

1459
02:31:53,064 --> 02:31:54,690
- Mother!

1460
02:31:56,734 --> 02:31:58,152
Mother!

1461
02:32:00,362 --> 02:32:01,447
Mother!

1462
02:32:19,632 --> 02:32:20,883
Mother!

1463
02:33:27,158 --> 02:33:28,200
"Haider..."

1464
02:33:28,200 --> 02:33:31,704
"Avenge me of my brother."

1465
02:33:31,704 --> 02:33:34,748
"Aim bullets at those
cunning, deceiving eyes..."

1466
02:33:34,915 --> 02:33:38,377
"that entrapped your mother..."

1467
02:33:38,377 --> 02:33:41,630
"Revenge only begets revenge..."

1468
02:33:41,630 --> 02:33:42,840
"Avenge me..."

1469
02:33:42,840 --> 02:33:45,384
"Revenge does not set you free..."

1470
02:33:46,969 --> 02:33:49,221
"Revenge does not set you free..."

1471
02:33:49,221 --> 02:33:50,681
"Avenge me..."

1472
02:33:52,975 --> 02:33:56,478
"Freedom lies beyond revenge..."

1473
02:34:08,282 --> 02:34:09,491
Haider!

1474
02:34:12,286 --> 02:34:14,496
Haider! Finish me off...

1475
02:34:17,082 --> 02:34:19,877
Take your revenge...

1476
02:34:23,881 --> 02:34:25,424
Ghazala...

1477
02:34:32,389 --> 02:34:34,391
Brother...
