1
00:01:34,868 --> 00:01:37,268
Ninety-one, 92...

2
00:01:37,269 --> 00:01:39,827
- It's down there.
- Shit... what if they catch us?

3
00:01:39,828 --> 00:01:41,908
There's a million bottles
of booze in there.

4
00:01:41,909 --> 00:01:43,817
You think they're gonna miss one?

5
00:01:57,973 --> 00:02:00,340
Weather is with us, sir.

6
00:02:00,341 --> 00:02:03,605
We arrive in port in a...
couple of hours.

7
00:02:03,606 --> 00:02:05,300
Very good.

8
00:02:05,301 --> 00:02:07,472
You're welcome, sir.

9
00:02:10,943 --> 00:02:12,104
Here...

10
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:15,829
Ey, man, I never smelt anything like this.
Not even when you're in the crapper.

11
00:02:15,830 --> 00:02:19,125
Oh, what...
Your shit smells like roses?

12
00:02:19,126 --> 00:02:20,850
Alright, look!

13
00:02:21,463 --> 00:02:23,698
I'll give you a hand.

14
00:02:29,207 --> 00:02:33,003
- Thought you said it was booze.
- That's what the papers said.

15
00:02:37,303 --> 00:02:39,607
Captain, we have a breach
in lower level... Look.

16
00:02:39,642 --> 00:02:41,581
- Which section?
- 101.

17
00:02:41,943 --> 00:02:43,382
Fuck. Take the wheel.

18
00:02:43,383 --> 00:02:45,204
- Yes, sir.
- Fuck.

19
00:02:46,712 --> 00:02:49,296
Close the door!
Get the masks.

20
00:02:54,808 --> 00:02:57,327
Holy shit.

21
00:02:57,496 --> 00:02:59,885
Take care of 'em.

22
00:03:41,052 --> 00:03:42,074
Hello.

23
00:03:42,075 --> 00:03:44,179
- Morning.
- Passport, please.

24
00:03:50,107 --> 00:03:51,534
Rough seas?

25
00:03:51,642 --> 00:03:54,970
The sea was smooth. The party was
a bit rough, if you know what I mean.

26
00:03:54,971 --> 00:03:56,634
- Ibiza.
- Yeah.

27
00:03:56,635 --> 00:03:58,489
Thanks.

28
00:04:08,187 --> 00:04:11,067
When I was a kid,
my father used to take me fishing.

29
00:04:11,068 --> 00:04:14,646
Never could figure out
how he knew where the fish were.

30
00:04:15,260 --> 00:04:19,035
They were always exactly
where he said they would be.

31
00:04:42,365 --> 00:04:44,029
Security check.

32
00:04:44,030 --> 00:04:45,852
Do I look like a security risk?

33
00:04:45,853 --> 00:04:49,235
Please step out of the car and bring
your documents to the office.

34
00:04:49,597 --> 00:04:51,293
My documents are right here, sir.

35
00:04:51,294 --> 00:04:53,812
The computer is...
in the office.

36
00:04:54,814 --> 00:04:56,157
Her too.

37
00:04:56,158 --> 00:04:57,948
She's sleeping.

38
00:04:57,949 --> 00:05:01,079
- With her documents.
- Okay, sure.

39
00:05:04,061 --> 00:05:06,864
Oh, jeez, I got something.

40
00:05:14,911 --> 00:05:16,470
You're gonna lose it.

41
00:05:20,319 --> 00:05:22,424
Close, inspector, you're close.

42
00:05:26,590 --> 00:05:28,958
Ooh, that's a big one.
Go left, go left.

43
00:05:30,975 --> 00:05:33,146
Don't let him get away.

44
00:05:37,151 --> 00:05:38,841
You're close.

45
00:05:43,519 --> 00:05:45,427
Go left, go left! Go right!

46
00:05:48,544 --> 00:05:50,815
Must be Moby Dick you hooked, inspector.
You need some help?

47
00:05:50,816 --> 00:05:52,310
No, thank you, Frank.

48
00:05:53,119 --> 00:05:56,698
I have been fishing these waters
since before you were born.

49
00:06:01,377 --> 00:06:05,118
You were close, inspector.
You were close.

50
00:06:08,066 --> 00:06:11,905
Good thing that we French have such
a highly developed sense of humor.

51
00:06:11,906 --> 00:06:15,360
With all due respect, the French
think Jerry Lewis is a genius.

52
00:06:15,361 --> 00:06:18,560
- Jerry Lewis is a genius.
- Dean was a genius.

53
00:06:18,561 --> 00:06:21,696
No... Dean just stood there
with a drink and a cigarette.

54
00:06:21,697 --> 00:06:24,737
My point exactly.
Anyone can fall down and get a laugh.

55
00:06:24,738 --> 00:06:28,316
How many people can do it standing
still with a drink and a cigarette?

56
00:06:29,839 --> 00:06:31,017
Yes?

57
00:06:31,018 --> 00:06:34,018
Yes.
On the lake fishing.

58
00:06:35,319 --> 00:06:37,018
Understand.

59
00:06:38,402 --> 00:06:42,177
I am afraid our day of leisure
is cut short.

60
00:06:42,178 --> 00:06:43,777
There is a mess in Marseilles.

61
00:06:43,778 --> 00:06:47,008
Some madman driving an Audi
at impossible speed.

62
00:06:48,995 --> 00:06:51,010
Don't look at me.

63
00:06:51,011 --> 00:06:53,953
That is the first place
the chief told me to look.

64
00:06:53,954 --> 00:06:58,427
But I will tell him
you have the perfect alibi.

65
00:06:59,427 --> 00:07:01,695
As usual.

66
00:07:02,358 --> 00:07:03,816
Well...

67
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:08,317
Whoa... Tarconi!

68
00:07:09,156 --> 00:07:10,723
- Please!
- I am sorry, Frank.

69
00:07:10,724 --> 00:07:14,171
- It's our first bite!
- Yeah, yeah.

70
00:07:14,404 --> 00:07:16,386
- Please.
- Yeah.

71
00:07:16,387 --> 00:07:17,953
Stop the boat. Come on.

72
00:07:17,988 --> 00:07:21,085
- No. No, Frank.
- Come on, please.

73
00:07:59,206 --> 00:08:03,101
Purpose of your visit, Mr. Johnson?

74
00:08:03,366 --> 00:08:04,794
Business.

75
00:08:04,870 --> 00:08:06,527
What kind of business?

76
00:08:06,630 --> 00:08:08,832
Environmental protection.

77
00:08:14,982 --> 00:08:16,510
Thank you.

78
00:08:18,279 --> 00:08:21,669
Mr. Minister, you're giving the opening
address at an EU conference...

79
00:08:21,670 --> 00:08:24,486
...on environmental impact of industry
in Odessa tomorrow.

80
00:08:24,487 --> 00:08:27,303
- What is top on your list of priorities?
- It's a short list.

81
00:08:27,338 --> 00:08:30,118
There's one item: the environment
and how to protect it.

82
00:08:30,119 --> 00:08:32,038
In the face of increasing pressure...

83
00:08:32,039 --> 00:08:35,047
...for industries to compete
successfully in a global economy...

84
00:08:35,048 --> 00:08:38,439
...that goal can sometimes come up
against some very harsh realities.

85
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:41,478
Well, not as harsh as
a polluted and uninhabitable planet.

86
00:08:41,479 --> 00:08:43,303
Gentlemen, if you'll excuse me now...

87
00:08:43,304 --> 00:08:46,849
...I have trees to save
and industrialists to disappoint.

88
00:08:49,928 --> 00:08:52,512
- Your speech for tomorrow.
- Any good?

89
00:08:52,551 --> 00:08:56,742
- It's going to piss off a lot of people.
- Excellent.

90
00:09:18,441 --> 00:09:19,870
Hello?

91
00:09:20,553 --> 00:09:22,724
Mr. Minister?

92
00:09:23,242 --> 00:09:24,584
Who is this?

93
00:09:24,585 --> 00:09:26,985
My name is not important.

94
00:09:26,986 --> 00:09:29,321
I've been put in charge of
the negotiations...

95
00:09:29,322 --> 00:09:31,817
...you are engaged in with Ecocorp...

96
00:09:31,818 --> 00:09:35,145
...for issuance of their license
to do business in the Ukraine.

97
00:09:35,146 --> 00:09:37,706
You must be misinformed,
Mr. Whatever-Your-Name-Is.

98
00:09:37,707 --> 00:09:39,881
I've terminated negotiations
permanently.

99
00:09:39,882 --> 00:09:42,377
I think you will reconsider
that position...

100
00:09:42,378 --> 00:09:46,120
...once you have a chance to study
the documents in the envelope.

101
00:09:59,947 --> 00:10:02,313
I'll be in touch.

102
00:10:41,453 --> 00:10:44,012
Yeah, there's been an accident.

103
00:10:44,013 --> 00:10:47,689
Send an ambulance,
8 Route de la Falaise.

104
00:11:04,911 --> 00:11:06,413
Malcolm.

105
00:11:06,414 --> 00:11:08,487
Malcolm. Malcolm.

106
00:11:13,903 --> 00:11:16,430
I asked you for your price.
What is this?

107
00:11:16,431 --> 00:11:20,805
A man who might be interested
in taking the job. This man will.

108
00:11:20,847 --> 00:11:22,798
My boss said you're the man
for the job.

109
00:11:22,799 --> 00:11:24,872
Your boss got his facts wrong.

110
00:11:26,702 --> 00:11:28,814
Two things you should know
about my boss:

111
00:11:28,815 --> 00:11:32,110
He never gets his facts wrong,
he never takes no for an answer.

112
00:11:32,111 --> 00:11:34,533
Well, there's a first time
for everything.

113
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:45,767
Well, not this time.

114
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:53,421
You don't wanna do this.

115
00:11:53,456 --> 00:11:57,423
I don't think you're in a position to
tell me what I do and don't wanna do.

116
00:11:57,424 --> 00:12:00,751
You have 10 seconds
to change your mind.

117
00:12:04,497 --> 00:12:08,206
I'll give you five seconds
to remove your hand.

118
00:13:05,171 --> 00:13:07,379
Malcolm. Malcolm.

119
00:13:07,380 --> 00:13:08,807
You hear me?

120
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:13,491
Mal, I said drop in anytime,
but I didn't mean...

121
00:13:13,492 --> 00:13:16,557
- Nowhere else to go.
- Just take it easy, okay?

122
00:13:17,716 --> 00:13:19,091
Don't move me from the car.

123
00:13:19,092 --> 00:13:23,368
- It's just till the ambulance arrives.
- No ambulance.

124
00:13:23,732 --> 00:13:27,026
You need a doctor, you've been shot.
I can't take care of this.

125
00:13:28,373 --> 00:13:31,219
Not far from car.

126
00:13:32,181 --> 00:13:33,556
Relax.

127
00:13:33,557 --> 00:13:38,477
Just try to stay calm.
We'll have you fixed up in no time.

128
00:13:48,565 --> 00:13:50,987
He's inside. Quick, it's serious.

129
00:13:54,902 --> 00:13:56,053
Sir?

130
00:13:56,054 --> 00:13:59,317
- You wanna be careful moving him.
- We know our job, okay?

131
00:13:59,318 --> 00:14:01,909
Sir, can you hear me?

132
00:14:01,910 --> 00:14:03,573
This car... No...

133
00:14:03,574 --> 00:14:05,462
If you hear me, press my hand.

134
00:14:05,463 --> 00:14:07,186
The car...

135
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:57,207
Am I in heaven?

136
00:14:57,433 --> 00:14:59,767
Actually, you're in a bit of the shit.

137
00:14:59,929 --> 00:15:02,797
You'll help me out of it?

138
00:15:03,001 --> 00:15:05,016
That depends on
how deep you're in.

139
00:15:05,017 --> 00:15:08,497
- Don't trust anyone.
- Couldn't agree with you more.

140
00:15:10,169 --> 00:15:11,864
- Come on.
- No! Don't leave the car!

141
00:15:11,865 --> 00:15:15,378
- What's so special about the car?
- Not the car.

142
00:15:26,586 --> 00:15:28,789
Wait!

143
00:15:55,931 --> 00:15:57,359
I told you.

144
00:16:01,820 --> 00:16:03,990
<i>Don't trust anyone.</i>

145
00:16:05,051 --> 00:16:06,961
<i>I told you.</i>

146
00:16:56,862 --> 00:16:59,101
I took the liberty
of bringing your suit.

147
00:16:59,102 --> 00:17:01,373
It's what you wear when
you're working, correct?

148
00:17:01,374 --> 00:17:04,407
Correct. But I'm not working.

149
00:17:04,446 --> 00:17:07,893
- You see, boss? I told you.
- Please, Joseph.

150
00:17:08,095 --> 00:17:12,094
Your approach was not very effective in
presenting our proposal the first time.

151
00:17:12,095 --> 00:17:14,068
Thank you.

152
00:17:14,238 --> 00:17:15,391
As I was saying...

153
00:17:15,392 --> 00:17:18,589
...we came to you in good faith.
You said you were unavailable.

154
00:17:18,590 --> 00:17:21,118
We contracted with the man
whose number you gave us.

155
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:22,782
He proved to be ineffective.

156
00:17:22,783 --> 00:17:26,111
And now I am left
with unfinished business.

157
00:17:26,112 --> 00:17:28,795
The way I see it, you're responsible.

158
00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:30,943
I understand your point of view.

159
00:17:30,944 --> 00:17:32,568
But I'm still unavailable.

160
00:17:34,016 --> 00:17:35,902
Boss, can I say something?

161
00:17:38,144 --> 00:17:40,762
Anyone else wanna say something?

162
00:17:43,295 --> 00:17:45,023
Good.

163
00:17:45,024 --> 00:17:47,445
Find me a smarter one.

164
00:17:49,216 --> 00:17:51,359
You have three seconds
to change your mind...

165
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:54,491
...or you're gonna
be permanently unavailable.

166
00:17:54,624 --> 00:17:56,598
One.

167
00:17:58,304 --> 00:17:59,733
Two.

168
00:18:02,337 --> 00:18:03,864
One condition.

169
00:18:06,401 --> 00:18:08,310
I'm listening.

170
00:18:08,513 --> 00:18:11,098
I drive my own car.

171
00:18:11,874 --> 00:18:13,761
Deal.

172
00:18:16,449 --> 00:18:19,905
In anticipation of your answer, we took
the liberty of bringing your car.

173
00:18:19,906 --> 00:18:23,872
Changed the oil, gave it a tune-up,
took out all the non-essential material.

174
00:18:23,873 --> 00:18:27,456
Left the switch-over license plates.
Love that.

175
00:18:27,457 --> 00:18:29,826
Replaced the GPS
with one of our own.

176
00:18:29,827 --> 00:18:32,034
Preprogrammed.
More efficient that way.

177
00:18:32,035 --> 00:18:36,344
Why I was so insistent on using only
the best man for this assignment?

178
00:18:38,498 --> 00:18:41,026
We're playing
in a much larger game here.

179
00:18:41,027 --> 00:18:45,979
Don't think of this as just another job.
Think of it as a mission.

180
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:50,371
I'm so pleased to find we share
the same approach to our work.

181
00:18:50,372 --> 00:18:52,546
I make a deal, that's the deal.
Just like you.

182
00:18:52,547 --> 00:18:55,362
You don't like names. Neither do I.
We're both precise.

183
00:18:55,363 --> 00:18:58,530
Neither one of us has any interest
in what we're paid to do...

184
00:18:58,531 --> 00:19:02,808
...beyond what we are paid to do.
Those are your rules, right?

185
00:19:10,180 --> 00:19:12,220
You forgot one.

186
00:19:12,324 --> 00:19:15,555
- I work alone.
- I thought you might like the company.

187
00:19:15,556 --> 00:19:18,240
Thought you wanted me
to complete a mission.

188
00:19:19,909 --> 00:19:22,111
You're right. I do.

189
00:19:24,293 --> 00:19:25,917
Wait.

190
00:19:27,269 --> 00:19:29,603
What, you wanna change the rules?

191
00:19:30,662 --> 00:19:33,791
Every rule has an exception.
Let's make one for today.

192
00:19:36,422 --> 00:19:38,014
You're the boss.

193
00:19:40,197 --> 00:19:42,587
Anything else?

194
00:19:42,757 --> 00:19:44,960
The jewelry.
Anything I should know?

195
00:19:48,005 --> 00:19:50,724
You remember those jokers
trying to blow up airliners...

196
00:19:50,725 --> 00:19:53,637
...by sneaking liquids through
and combining them onboard?

197
00:19:53,638 --> 00:19:55,653
Same principle, just refined.

198
00:19:55,654 --> 00:19:57,443
Twenty-five feet from the car...

199
00:19:57,478 --> 00:20:00,933
...yellow light comes on,
signaling the first liquid is ready.

200
00:20:00,934 --> 00:20:03,137
Fifty feet, orange.

201
00:20:03,430 --> 00:20:05,285
Second liquid
flows into the chamber.

202
00:20:05,286 --> 00:20:08,613
Seventy-five feet,
you're gonna see red.

203
00:20:13,159 --> 00:20:15,330
Time to go.

204
00:20:15,335 --> 00:20:19,360
This phone is programmed
to call only one number, mine.

205
00:20:19,911 --> 00:20:24,100
When you pass the first toll on the
road going north, call me, all right?

206
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:27,718
Money for gas and food.

207
00:20:27,719 --> 00:20:29,344
Any other questions?

208
00:20:59,209 --> 00:21:01,761
Would you mind
buckling your seat belt?

209
00:21:11,754 --> 00:21:15,267
Don't suppose you wanna tell me
what this is all about?

210
00:21:20,362 --> 00:21:22,664
Great.

211
00:21:37,258 --> 00:21:40,193
Ocean Pearl
requesting cargo clearance.

212
00:21:41,355 --> 00:21:44,138
The papers are with
the environmental agency.

213
00:21:44,139 --> 00:21:46,154
Drop anchor and wait to dock.

214
00:21:46,155 --> 00:21:49,155
- We'll inform you when they're signed.
- Okay.

215
00:21:57,868 --> 00:21:59,690
I know what happened to you.

216
00:21:59,691 --> 00:22:02,310
But what happened to Frank?

217
00:22:07,340 --> 00:22:11,748
Colonel Medved over at Intelligence
has been given all the information.

218
00:22:11,917 --> 00:22:13,387
He knows it's top priority.

219
00:22:13,388 --> 00:22:16,044
He wants you to know
he has his best men on it.

220
00:22:16,045 --> 00:22:18,316
He'll keep it out of official channels.

221
00:22:18,317 --> 00:22:22,309
He suggests you buy
as much time as you can.

222
00:23:15,023 --> 00:23:19,726
Look, I don't know what your part in all
this is or isn't. And I don't really care.

223
00:23:19,727 --> 00:23:22,127
You were here first,
you know more than I do...

224
00:23:22,128 --> 00:23:23,951
...download me on what you know.

225
00:23:23,952 --> 00:23:25,647
I know nothing.

226
00:23:25,648 --> 00:23:28,174
How did you know Malcolm?

227
00:23:28,175 --> 00:23:29,604
I didn't.

228
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:32,909
You just happened to end up in a car
with a man you don't know?

229
00:23:34,512 --> 00:23:37,000
I'm now in a car
with man I don't know.

230
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:41,320
Aren't you supposed to make a call?

231
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:48,560
<i>Nice to hear from you.</i>

232
00:23:48,561 --> 00:23:51,824
You can skip the pleasantries.
Just give me the code.

233
00:23:51,825 --> 00:23:53,864
<i>1- 1- 2-6.</i>

234
00:23:57,456 --> 00:24:00,238
<i>Call me when you arrive.</i>

235
00:24:01,489 --> 00:24:03,952
What's in Budapest?

236
00:24:03,953 --> 00:24:06,604
Goulash. Beer.

237
00:24:12,850 --> 00:24:14,225
All right.

238
00:24:14,226 --> 00:24:17,389
Let's rewind here,
start with the proper introductions.

239
00:24:17,522 --> 00:24:20,145
What happened
to the rule of no names?

240
00:24:20,146 --> 00:24:23,559
I'm suspending that rule
for the moment.

241
00:24:26,034 --> 00:24:28,619
I'm Frank Martin.

242
00:24:30,354 --> 00:24:32,208
And your name is?

243
00:24:34,803 --> 00:24:37,551
What matters, my name?

244
00:24:37,651 --> 00:24:40,912
Well, we're in this situation together.

245
00:24:40,979 --> 00:24:42,920
No.

246
00:24:45,011 --> 00:24:49,068
We're sitting here with two exploding
bracelets on, going to the same place.

247
00:24:49,716 --> 00:24:52,019
I'd call that being
in the same situation.

248
00:24:52,020 --> 00:24:54,955
It's not. They are going to kill you.

249
00:24:56,403 --> 00:24:58,793
I'm aware of that.

250
00:24:59,252 --> 00:25:02,323
In all probability, after they kill me,
you're next on the list.

251
00:25:02,324 --> 00:25:05,907
Now, if I'm gonna keep that from
happening, I'm gonna need a little help.

252
00:25:05,908 --> 00:25:08,628
From the top. We have this problem.

253
00:25:08,629 --> 00:25:10,963
You think I don't know
it's a problem?

254
00:25:10,964 --> 00:25:13,233
I look stupid to you?

255
00:25:13,428 --> 00:25:16,297
I didn't say you were stupid.

256
00:25:17,493 --> 00:25:18,996
But we have a problem...

257
00:25:18,997 --> 00:25:22,990
...and you're not being very helpful
in participating in the solution of it.

258
00:25:24,117 --> 00:25:26,768
I don't want to talk anymore.

259
00:25:33,364 --> 00:25:35,055
Fine.

260
00:25:47,413 --> 00:25:49,552
What did you say your name was?

261
00:25:50,006 --> 00:25:53,333
Frank. Frank Martin.

262
00:25:53,814 --> 00:25:56,225
Frank Martin.

263
00:25:56,260 --> 00:25:58,635
Valentina.

264
00:26:01,110 --> 00:26:03,979
Pleased to meet you.

265
00:26:57,209 --> 00:26:59,761
<i>The gentlemen
from Ecocorp are here.</i>

266
00:27:00,697 --> 00:27:02,290
Show them in.

267
00:27:09,306 --> 00:27:10,734
Gentlemen.

268
00:27:13,402 --> 00:27:15,065
Mr. Minister.

269
00:27:15,066 --> 00:27:18,009
We'd like to thank you for
reconsidering our proposal...

270
00:27:18,010 --> 00:27:20,983
...on such short notice.
- You make it very hard not to.

271
00:27:21,018 --> 00:27:24,978
Well, yes. We do have a reputation
of not taking no for an answer.

272
00:27:25,402 --> 00:27:27,289
Here are the contracts.

273
00:27:28,603 --> 00:27:30,097
All in order.

274
00:27:30,427 --> 00:27:32,570
We were told the ships
couldn't be cleared...

275
00:27:32,571 --> 00:27:34,682
...unless you personally
signed off on them.

276
00:27:34,683 --> 00:27:36,438
Ships?

277
00:27:36,507 --> 00:27:38,074
I thought there was only one.

278
00:27:38,075 --> 00:27:40,634
Oh, well, here's the thing.

279
00:27:40,635 --> 00:27:43,450
In order to make the venture
more profitable...

280
00:27:43,451 --> 00:27:46,491
...we need to process the material
in a volume that makes sense.

281
00:27:46,492 --> 00:27:48,250
How many ships
are we talking about?

282
00:27:48,251 --> 00:27:52,343
Plus the one in the port
waiting on clearance, eight.

283
00:27:52,475 --> 00:27:53,979
Eight.

284
00:27:53,980 --> 00:27:55,572
This year.

285
00:27:56,315 --> 00:27:59,419
Protecting the environment
is a long-term commitment.

286
00:27:59,420 --> 00:28:01,531
You've said so yourself, haven't you?

287
00:28:01,532 --> 00:28:04,155
And I will do again tomorrow
in Odessa...

288
00:28:04,156 --> 00:28:07,386
...where I will sign these.

289
00:28:07,836 --> 00:28:10,683
We were really hoping to
settle this today.

290
00:28:10,684 --> 00:28:15,068
I want to review them, now that
there are some addendums.

291
00:28:15,069 --> 00:28:17,339
Twenty-four hours
doesn't make a difference...

292
00:28:17,340 --> 00:28:20,089
...on such a long-term
commitment, will it?

293
00:28:20,349 --> 00:28:23,133
No, of course not.

294
00:28:23,134 --> 00:28:27,443
Then I will see you tomorrow
in Odessa. Let's say 9 a. m.

295
00:28:32,605 --> 00:28:34,141
<i>Yes.</i>

296
00:28:34,142 --> 00:28:35,996
Okay, I'll stay.

297
00:28:35,997 --> 00:28:37,757
- But the material is leaking.
- And?

298
00:28:37,758 --> 00:28:40,414
- We won't be able to hide it.
- I'll take care of it.

299
00:28:40,415 --> 00:28:41,853
If ever they check...

300
00:28:41,854 --> 00:28:44,254
<i>Easy. The deal will be closed
very soon.</i>

301
00:28:44,255 --> 00:28:46,294
Twenty-four hours. No more.

302
00:28:54,558 --> 00:28:58,365
- Yes?
- I've bought you another 24 hours.

303
00:28:58,366 --> 00:29:00,766
You have until tomorrow, 9 a. m.

304
00:29:00,767 --> 00:29:03,003
That should be
more than enough time.

305
00:29:03,104 --> 00:29:05,054
<i>Do you have a lead?</i>

306
00:29:05,055 --> 00:29:07,258
Better than a lead.

307
00:29:07,583 --> 00:29:09,011
A location.

308
00:29:45,537 --> 00:29:47,904
I'm hungry.

309
00:29:48,417 --> 00:29:51,286
We're 100 kilometers
from beer and sausage.

310
00:29:52,225 --> 00:29:55,006
I don't like sausage.

311
00:29:57,217 --> 00:29:59,552
What would you like?

312
00:30:03,074 --> 00:30:04,833
Veal.

313
00:30:04,834 --> 00:30:06,880
Roast, with carrots...

314
00:30:06,881 --> 00:30:08,703
...and beets.

315
00:30:09,762 --> 00:30:12,865
In gravy, with Madeira in stock.

316
00:30:12,866 --> 00:30:14,556
Nothing to start?

317
00:30:17,506 --> 00:30:19,874
A salad.

318
00:30:20,003 --> 00:30:23,298
Greens tossed with balsamic.

319
00:30:23,333 --> 00:30:25,185
From Modena.

320
00:30:25,186 --> 00:30:26,722
Aged?

321
00:30:26,723 --> 00:30:29,090
Of course, aged.

322
00:30:31,523 --> 00:30:33,912
And for dessert?

323
00:30:34,660 --> 00:30:36,666
Sachertorte.

324
00:30:36,707 --> 00:30:39,576
With whipped cream or without?

325
00:30:40,419 --> 00:30:42,176
With.

326
00:30:42,467 --> 00:30:44,702
To drink?

327
00:30:46,083 --> 00:30:47,392
Wine.

328
00:30:47,427 --> 00:30:49,631
Tokaj, perhaps?

329
00:30:49,668 --> 00:30:51,162
Ice wine.

330
00:30:51,811 --> 00:30:54,015
Of course.

331
00:31:04,965 --> 00:31:08,128
- What are you doing?
- Seeing a man about some jewelry.

332
00:31:18,885 --> 00:31:20,826
He's gone off the reservation.

333
00:31:22,629 --> 00:31:26,273
Send someone to get him back on.

334
00:31:26,438 --> 00:31:28,739
Don't kill him.

335
00:31:53,926 --> 00:31:56,710
Frank. It's so good to see you,
'mein Freund'.

336
00:31:56,711 --> 00:31:59,270
Good to see you too, Otto.

337
00:31:59,271 --> 00:32:02,140
You didn't mention
you bring company.

338
00:32:02,183 --> 00:32:03,742
It's not really company.

339
00:32:03,783 --> 00:32:05,824
It's...

340
00:32:06,503 --> 00:32:07,750
...complicated.

341
00:32:07,751 --> 00:32:10,790
With you, it's always complicated.
You can tell me about it...

342
00:32:10,791 --> 00:32:14,849
...over a nice schnitzel
with 'Kartoffelsalat' I have prepared.

343
00:32:14,983 --> 00:32:17,255
Hey, Otto, you know
I love your schnitzel...

344
00:32:17,256 --> 00:32:20,069
...but we need to get rid of this first.

345
00:32:22,024 --> 00:32:25,820
Binary free-form
magnetic-resolution technology.

346
00:32:25,832 --> 00:32:27,456
English, please, Otto.

347
00:32:28,393 --> 00:32:30,503
There's a program the
Pentagon has funded...

348
00:32:30,504 --> 00:32:33,671
...through one of their
subsidiary front companies...

349
00:32:33,672 --> 00:32:37,063
...that's been experimenting with
this new kind of weaponry...

350
00:32:37,064 --> 00:32:39,784
...based on the theory
of magnetic attraction.

351
00:32:39,785 --> 00:32:42,206
Very hush-hush stuff.

352
00:32:43,337 --> 00:32:46,312
I didn't realize you were in the loop
on the Pentagon hush-hush.

353
00:32:46,313 --> 00:32:48,456
You wouldn't believe
what you can discover...

354
00:32:48,457 --> 00:32:50,729
...walking through the Internet.

355
00:32:50,730 --> 00:32:53,320
You wanna see the
invasion plans for Iran?

356
00:32:53,321 --> 00:32:55,177
Maybe some other time.

357
00:32:55,178 --> 00:32:58,665
Right now we need to get this thing off
without blowing myself to Iran.

358
00:32:58,666 --> 00:33:01,193
I don't wanna bother you
with the details...

359
00:33:01,194 --> 00:33:06,016
...but usually there's
a transmitter plate close by.

360
00:33:11,498 --> 00:33:13,097
You should not be doing this.

361
00:33:13,098 --> 00:33:15,210
First you don't talk,
now you offer advice.

362
00:33:15,211 --> 00:33:17,897
Not advice. A warning.

363
00:33:17,898 --> 00:33:20,288
Well, a little late for warnings,
don't you think?

364
00:33:26,379 --> 00:33:27,938
I agree with you.

365
00:33:31,915 --> 00:33:33,857
You're off course.

366
00:33:39,275 --> 00:33:42,243
- Should I?
- Yeah, you should.

367
00:33:47,531 --> 00:33:49,505
Look, fellas...

368
00:33:49,836 --> 00:33:53,098
...some things in the car
were a bit off, needed checking.

369
00:33:53,996 --> 00:33:56,395
In my profession,
a man is only as good as the car.

370
00:33:56,396 --> 00:33:59,942
You take care of the car,
the car will take care of you.

371
00:34:01,548 --> 00:34:04,264
The boss says, "Back on the road. "

372
00:34:04,268 --> 00:34:06,024
Frank?

373
00:34:06,316 --> 00:34:07,745
Keep at it.

374
00:34:09,932 --> 00:34:11,460
Back in the car, Frank.

375
00:34:11,661 --> 00:34:13,285
No.

376
00:35:21,296 --> 00:35:23,751
- Find it?
- Not yet.

377
00:36:36,884 --> 00:36:38,611
You're the smart one?

378
00:36:38,612 --> 00:36:41,579
No. I'm the big one.

379
00:37:31,158 --> 00:37:32,882
Not so big anymore, are you?

380
00:37:54,104 --> 00:37:56,306
Found it.

381
00:37:59,895 --> 00:38:02,764
- The transmitter.
- Can you remove it?

382
00:38:04,695 --> 00:38:06,124
It's wired.

383
00:38:06,168 --> 00:38:08,370
If I do:

384
00:39:03,483 --> 00:39:05,904
You fight good.

385
00:39:08,346 --> 00:39:10,833
But you tie bad.

386
00:39:15,770 --> 00:39:17,198
Where are you going?

387
00:39:17,242 --> 00:39:19,413
Tired.

388
00:39:20,091 --> 00:39:22,676
That's why I prefer to deal with cars.

389
00:39:23,035 --> 00:39:25,107
That makes two of us.

390
00:39:25,147 --> 00:39:28,186
What do you want me to do
when they...? When they wake up?

391
00:39:28,187 --> 00:39:31,602
Probably best to take
the rest of the day off.

392
00:39:48,732 --> 00:39:50,011
I'm not amused.

393
00:39:50,012 --> 00:39:51,995
You'd be less amused
if you ended up dead.

394
00:39:51,996 --> 00:39:54,491
<i>If you wanted me dead, I'd be dead.
You need me.</i>

395
00:39:54,492 --> 00:39:57,655
You want me to complete the job,
I need some clarification.

396
00:39:58,749 --> 00:40:00,140
I'm listening.

397
00:40:00,175 --> 00:40:01,532
In person.

398
00:40:01,533 --> 00:40:03,100
We've already done in person.

399
00:40:03,101 --> 00:40:05,587
<i>Well, not to my satisfaction,
apparently.</i>

400
00:40:05,821 --> 00:40:09,082
Right now, my satisfaction
should be your main concern.

401
00:40:09,662 --> 00:40:12,562
Same place. One hour.
Wait for my call.

402
00:41:06,656 --> 00:41:07,870
Hello?

403
00:41:07,871 --> 00:41:09,918
You've disappointed me.

404
00:41:09,919 --> 00:41:13,055
You won't be the first
and you won't be the last.

405
00:41:13,056 --> 00:41:17,823
- I told you I wanted to do this in person.
- That won't be necessary. You see...

406
00:41:17,824 --> 00:41:20,000
...since our little chat
at the beginning...

407
00:41:20,001 --> 00:41:23,551
...I've been thinking I don't need
the best for this mundane assignment.

408
00:41:23,552 --> 00:41:25,823
Any idiot with
a driver's license will do.

409
00:41:25,824 --> 00:41:28,927
So in the words of the
great American, Donald Trump:

410
00:41:28,928 --> 00:41:32,604
I'm sorry, but you're fired.

411
00:42:16,578 --> 00:42:17,954
Who are you?

412
00:42:17,955 --> 00:42:20,642
- Your new chauffeur.
- I want the old one back.

413
00:42:20,643 --> 00:42:23,359
He's about to go to pieces.

414
00:43:28,550 --> 00:43:30,306
You're fired.

415
00:43:33,509 --> 00:43:34,854
How was your nap?

416
00:43:34,855 --> 00:43:37,349
Restful. How was your phone call?

417
00:43:37,350 --> 00:43:40,196
Brief. Fasten your seat belt.

418
00:43:51,143 --> 00:43:52,294
Tarconi.

419
00:43:52,295 --> 00:43:53,757
It's me.

420
00:43:54,407 --> 00:43:56,262
I was wondering
when you would call.

421
00:43:56,263 --> 00:43:57,607
I've been busy.

422
00:43:57,608 --> 00:44:00,608
Let me guess. In Budapest?

423
00:44:01,351 --> 00:44:03,107
You've been busy too.

424
00:44:03,112 --> 00:44:06,023
Never a problem keeping that way
with a friend like you.

425
00:44:06,024 --> 00:44:08,935
So I don't have to be redundant,
tell me what you know.

426
00:44:08,936 --> 00:44:11,463
There is a black Mercedes
also in Budapest.

427
00:44:11,464 --> 00:44:13,639
<i>Probably not occupied
by friends of yours.</i>

428
00:44:13,640 --> 00:44:16,640
That is what I know.
Now tell me what you know.

429
00:44:16,936 --> 00:44:20,327
I have two bags in the back
and a girl in the front.

430
00:44:20,328 --> 00:44:22,375
Russian, I think.

431
00:44:22,376 --> 00:44:24,647
I don't know what she
has to do with anything.

432
00:44:24,648 --> 00:44:26,728
Have you tried asking her?

433
00:44:26,729 --> 00:44:28,711
Now, why didn't I think of that?

434
00:44:28,712 --> 00:44:31,010
Sorry. Of course you've asked.
And she says?

435
00:44:31,145 --> 00:44:32,583
I'm going to die.

436
00:44:32,584 --> 00:44:34,984
Typical. Russians.

437
00:44:34,985 --> 00:44:37,288
They are so dark.

438
00:44:37,289 --> 00:44:40,841
I remember, in school,
reading Dostoyevsky and thinking...

439
00:44:40,842 --> 00:44:43,592
...when do these people laugh?

440
00:44:43,593 --> 00:44:45,385
One page after the other...

441
00:44:45,386 --> 00:44:48,425
...misery and suffering
like you wouldn't believe, Frank.

442
00:44:48,426 --> 00:44:51,881
Inspector, can we save the
literature lesson? I'm blinking here.

443
00:44:51,882 --> 00:44:53,506
Is that code?

444
00:44:53,930 --> 00:44:57,417
No, it's some bracelet
they accessorized us with.

445
00:44:57,418 --> 00:44:59,754
Wired to explode
if we get too far from the car.

446
00:44:59,755 --> 00:45:01,182
<i>They?</i>

447
00:45:01,386 --> 00:45:02,601
Some American.

448
00:45:02,602 --> 00:45:05,513
<i>Can you be more specific?
A name? A number?</i>

449
00:45:05,514 --> 00:45:06,698
Nothing.

450
00:45:06,699 --> 00:45:09,002
Why do you always
make it so easy, Frank?

451
00:45:09,003 --> 00:45:10,826
It's my nature.

452
00:45:10,827 --> 00:45:12,777
<i>Where are you? I will come there.</i>

453
00:45:12,778 --> 00:45:15,338
That's not a good idea.
They have me on a short leash.

454
00:45:15,339 --> 00:45:18,535
I can't be of much help
if you do not give me something.

455
00:45:19,626 --> 00:45:22,146
How close are you to a computer?

456
00:45:25,355 --> 00:45:26,602
Yes, Frank?

457
00:45:26,603 --> 00:45:29,451
<i>That wasn't very nice,
back there in the market.</i>

458
00:45:29,452 --> 00:45:32,363
You were the one
who broke the rules, not me.

459
00:45:32,364 --> 00:45:34,602
<i>Point well taken.</i>

460
00:45:34,603 --> 00:45:38,187
That makes us even. What say
we start with a clean slate?

461
00:45:38,188 --> 00:45:41,667
So this call is about
kiss-and-make-up, then?

462
00:45:41,803 --> 00:45:43,019
<i>More or less.</i>

463
00:45:43,020 --> 00:45:45,994
You have what I need
to get the bracelet off...

464
00:45:45,995 --> 00:45:49,192
...I have the packages
you need delivered.

465
00:45:49,708 --> 00:45:52,523
Here are the new coordinates,
then: 2-6-12.

466
00:45:52,524 --> 00:45:54,124
<i>That'll take you to the place...</i>

467
00:45:54,125 --> 00:45:56,523
<i>...where we can have a
conclusion to this business.</i>

468
00:45:56,524 --> 00:45:58,662
I look forward to it.

469
00:46:03,949 --> 00:46:05,389
Frank.

470
00:46:05,390 --> 00:46:07,014
<i>Did you get it?</i>

471
00:46:11,341 --> 00:46:13,388
Got the signal. Give us a little time...

472
00:46:13,389 --> 00:46:16,008
<i>...and we should have his number
and location.</i>

473
00:46:16,846 --> 00:46:18,983
Your new phone, sir.

474
00:46:24,143 --> 00:46:27,470
- Anything else?
- No.

475
00:46:30,350 --> 00:46:34,376
<i>Frank, do you know where
the signal is taking you?</i>

476
00:46:43,854 --> 00:46:48,014
I know restaurant there.
Fish like you never had.

477
00:46:48,015 --> 00:46:51,246
Roasted with small carrots
and black pepper.

478
00:46:51,247 --> 00:46:54,182
Romanian wine, not so good.

479
00:46:55,247 --> 00:46:58,444
But for the last meal,
could be worse.

480
00:47:00,368 --> 00:47:03,695
You really should begin
to think more positive.

481
00:47:03,696 --> 00:47:06,444
I'm realist.

482
00:47:07,824 --> 00:47:10,575
My friend was right when he said
you were doom and gloom.

483
00:47:10,576 --> 00:47:13,519
What means "doom and gloom"?

484
00:47:13,520 --> 00:47:16,527
You know, you only see
the horrible and the terrible.

485
00:47:16,528 --> 00:47:19,728
Your friend, where does he get this?
He doesn't know me.

486
00:47:19,763 --> 00:47:22,928
He was talking about you in general.
Russians, as a people.

487
00:47:22,929 --> 00:47:25,447
I'm not Russian. I'm Ukrainian.

488
00:47:25,649 --> 00:47:26,864
Excuse me.

489
00:47:26,865 --> 00:47:30,960
Not excused. We're different people.
We're different here...

490
00:47:30,961 --> 00:47:32,552
...and here.

491
00:47:37,521 --> 00:47:41,830
Me, personally, I think there's
a little bit of an optimist in you.

492
00:47:42,866 --> 00:47:45,647
How you can make such a statement?
You don't know me.

493
00:47:47,089 --> 00:47:49,521
Well, I see
you're putting makeup on.

494
00:47:49,522 --> 00:47:53,350
If you were so convinced
we was gonna die, why bother?

495
00:47:55,314 --> 00:47:59,089
What does looking good
have to do with dying?

496
00:48:05,106 --> 00:48:07,593
Hello.

497
00:48:08,082 --> 00:48:09,394
What's that?

498
00:48:09,395 --> 00:48:12,050
Souvenirs from Ibiza.
Do you want one?

499
00:48:12,051 --> 00:48:15,432
No, thank you. And neither do you.
We need to stay sharp.

500
00:48:16,947 --> 00:48:19,052
Okay.

501
00:48:23,475 --> 00:48:25,107
You stay sharp.

502
00:48:25,108 --> 00:48:28,307
I stay, how you say? Optimist?

503
00:48:28,308 --> 00:48:32,016
Give me that.
Give me that thing. Give me the pill!

504
00:48:34,708 --> 00:48:36,398
Give me that...

505
00:48:40,820 --> 00:48:43,340
Jesus.

506
00:48:45,236 --> 00:48:47,276
Great.

507
00:48:48,820 --> 00:48:52,147
- Just great.
- Come on, Frank Martin, lighten up.

508
00:48:52,148 --> 00:48:54,132
I should?
How about when those pills hit?

509
00:48:54,133 --> 00:48:56,851
You're gonna be lighting up
like a goddamn Christmas tree.

510
00:48:56,852 --> 00:48:58,347
That would be nice.

511
00:48:58,421 --> 00:49:00,981
Boring. Boring. Boring?

512
00:49:00,982 --> 00:49:03,316
Oh, yeah.

513
00:49:39,542 --> 00:49:41,559
You should stay in the car.

514
00:49:41,560 --> 00:49:44,275
You want me to pee in car?

515
00:49:48,887 --> 00:49:51,438
Okay. Go on.

516
00:49:54,711 --> 00:49:56,500
You remember.

517
00:50:21,176 --> 00:50:23,379
Don't.

518
00:50:43,738 --> 00:50:45,199
Don't.

519
00:50:46,105 --> 00:50:47,534
<i>Don't.</i>

520
00:51:06,906 --> 00:51:08,334
Oh, no.

521
00:51:44,541 --> 00:51:48,284
- Stop, all right?
- Why? I don't drive.

522
00:51:48,285 --> 00:51:49,436
I want to have fun.

523
00:51:49,437 --> 00:51:52,955
I want to be happy. You should
try happy instead of so serious.

524
00:51:52,956 --> 00:51:56,060
It's important to stay positive,
like you say, yeah?

525
00:51:56,061 --> 00:51:59,607
- Drink with me, Frankie.
- I don't want a drink.

526
00:52:01,789 --> 00:52:04,381
Now who is all gloomy and doomy?

527
00:52:04,382 --> 00:52:06,715
I say it right? Gloomy doomy?

528
00:52:07,229 --> 00:52:09,749
Come on, get in the car.

529
00:52:10,333 --> 00:52:12,788
I am free, like a bird.

530
00:52:19,998 --> 00:52:22,168
The girl! Come on! Faster!

531
00:52:30,111 --> 00:52:33,078
- I have lost my friend!
- I'll buy you a new one.

532
00:52:46,399 --> 00:52:48,788
Have any idea
why we have a car on our ass?

533
00:52:49,599 --> 00:52:51,388
I don't know. I don't care.

534
00:52:53,152 --> 00:52:55,647
- You mind?
- First you say I'm doom and gloom...

535
00:52:55,648 --> 00:52:58,843
...and now you tell me do not
be happy? Make up your mind.

536
00:53:46,050 --> 00:53:48,577
- Yes, Frank?
- I thought we had an agreement.

537
00:53:48,578 --> 00:53:49,985
We do.

538
00:53:49,986 --> 00:53:52,254
It had nothing to do
with a car on my ass.

539
00:53:53,345 --> 00:53:57,793
I don't have anything to do with that.
Someone else has issues with you?

540
00:53:57,794 --> 00:53:59,997
Likely.

541
00:54:02,179 --> 00:54:05,571
What I think is that there are
other forces at work here.

542
00:54:05,572 --> 00:54:08,065
Let me check into it,
see what I can find out.

543
00:54:08,066 --> 00:54:09,794
What do I do in the meantime?

544
00:54:09,795 --> 00:54:12,348
Drive faster.

545
00:54:44,933 --> 00:54:46,657
What the hell is he doing?

546
00:55:46,631 --> 00:55:48,519
There!

547
00:55:48,520 --> 00:55:50,340
He's down there!

548
00:55:55,208 --> 00:55:56,647
I'm hungry.

549
00:55:56,648 --> 00:55:59,200
Should have thought
about a sandwich, not vodka.

550
00:56:00,904 --> 00:56:02,366
Look!

551
00:56:08,040 --> 00:56:10,279
I wasn't hungry then, I was thirsty.

552
00:56:10,280 --> 00:56:12,352
Why you are so mean to me?

553
00:56:13,160 --> 00:56:16,673
- I'm not being mean. I'm preoccupied.
- What means "preoccupied"?

554
00:56:21,641 --> 00:56:23,615
That means preoccupied.

555
00:56:34,409 --> 00:56:36,777
Shoot the tires! Come on! Get him!

556
00:56:38,058 --> 00:56:40,993
- Get down!
- Shoot him!

557
00:56:50,795 --> 00:56:52,518
Bloody hell!

558
00:57:01,675 --> 00:57:03,332
Faster!

559
00:57:09,036 --> 00:57:11,075
Stop the car!

560
00:57:11,435 --> 00:57:13,092
Oh, shit!

561
00:58:14,958 --> 00:58:16,525
What are you doing?

562
00:58:16,526 --> 00:58:18,285
You're so tense.

563
00:58:18,286 --> 00:58:20,707
You don't say.

564
00:58:24,622 --> 00:58:26,695
I make you relax, okay?

565
00:58:27,503 --> 00:58:30,670
- Yeah.
- I'm good at this.

566
00:58:30,671 --> 00:58:33,289
Making tense go away.

567
00:58:41,456 --> 00:58:42,766
What are you doing?

568
00:58:42,767 --> 00:58:47,535
I want to feel sex
one more time before I die.

569
00:58:47,536 --> 00:58:49,422
Don't you?

570
00:58:51,120 --> 00:58:53,933
What is it with you and dying?

571
00:58:54,832 --> 00:58:57,864
There is something wrong with me?

572
00:58:57,968 --> 00:58:59,658
Am I not sexy?

573
00:59:00,496 --> 00:59:02,056
Yeah, you're sexy.

574
00:59:07,377 --> 00:59:08,804
You're the gay.

575
00:59:09,585 --> 00:59:12,880
Nope, I am not the gay.

576
00:59:12,881 --> 00:59:15,183
I don't mind.

577
00:59:16,753 --> 00:59:18,574
I'm not, okay?

578
00:59:20,466 --> 00:59:23,465
Then what's the problem?

579
00:59:25,041 --> 00:59:29,133
Did it ever occur to you
that maybe I'm not in the mood?

580
00:59:45,266 --> 00:59:48,849
- I thought rule is don't open package.
- It is.

581
00:59:48,850 --> 00:59:50,956
Why you have rules
if you break them?

582
00:59:51,698 --> 00:59:53,803
I keep asking myself the same thing.

583
00:59:54,738 --> 00:59:57,128
Phone books.

584
01:00:04,724 --> 01:00:07,504
- You're the package.
- Yes.

585
01:00:08,019 --> 01:00:09,807
Could have said something.

586
01:00:09,843 --> 01:00:12,810
- Would it make a difference?
- Yes.

587
01:00:14,323 --> 01:00:15,827
Now what are you doing?

588
01:00:15,828 --> 01:00:18,354
You know, back in garage...

589
01:00:18,355 --> 01:00:23,220
...it was very turn-on to me
when you take off your clothes.

590
01:00:23,221 --> 01:00:25,970
I was trying to keep five cretins
from caving my head in.

591
01:00:25,971 --> 01:00:27,539
I don't see the turn-on in that.

592
01:00:27,540 --> 01:00:32,595
You think it's only man
gets turned on by striptease?

593
01:00:32,596 --> 01:00:34,740
I don't like where this
is going, Valentina.

594
01:00:34,741 --> 01:00:38,068
Would you striptease for me again?

595
01:00:38,261 --> 01:00:40,980
Give me the keys. This is not funny.

596
01:00:40,981 --> 01:00:42,540
You want keys?

597
01:00:46,420 --> 01:00:48,820
I want you to stop playing around,
is what I want.

598
01:00:48,821 --> 01:00:52,149
Maybe it's last chance to
play around for you and for me.

599
01:00:52,184 --> 01:00:54,740
This is not the time
or the place for playing.

600
01:00:54,741 --> 01:00:58,836
Why do I get feeling with you
it's never time or place?

601
01:00:58,837 --> 01:01:01,236
If I wanna get analyzed,
I'll see a psychiatrist.

602
01:01:01,237 --> 01:01:03,856
Now, give me the keys.

603
01:01:03,894 --> 01:01:06,324
Come on, Frank Martin.

604
01:01:06,325 --> 01:01:08,943
Make playtime for me.

605
01:01:27,702 --> 01:01:30,294
All right? That enough?

606
01:01:30,295 --> 01:01:33,142
Not enough.
That is not a striptease, Frank.

607
01:01:33,143 --> 01:01:36,854
Striptease is sexy.
You know, move your ass a little.

608
01:01:36,855 --> 01:01:39,062
Come on, Frank Martin.

609
01:01:39,063 --> 01:01:41,270
You want keys?

610
01:01:41,271 --> 01:01:44,435
I want strip.

611
01:01:49,911 --> 01:01:52,599
You know what I'm gonna do to you
for making me do this?

612
01:01:52,600 --> 01:01:54,454
Spank me?

613
01:01:54,521 --> 01:01:55,895
For starters.

614
01:01:55,896 --> 01:01:58,863
- Tie me up?
- You'd like that, wouldn't you?

615
01:01:59,800 --> 01:02:02,768
I like the rough stuff.

616
01:02:05,529 --> 01:02:07,917
Really?

617
01:02:11,576 --> 01:02:14,707
Oh, but not too rough.

618
01:02:15,193 --> 01:02:17,656
Deal was a striptease for the keys.

619
01:02:17,657 --> 01:02:21,453
New deal. Kiss me for the keys.

620
01:02:28,314 --> 01:02:30,135
Like you mean it.

621
01:02:35,610 --> 01:02:39,123
Do you ever kiss
like you mean it, Frank?

622
01:02:39,738 --> 01:02:42,201
I'm thinking maybe not.

623
01:02:42,202 --> 01:02:44,853
I'm thinking you live alone.

624
01:02:45,338 --> 01:02:47,673
Inside and outside.

625
01:02:47,962 --> 01:02:51,002
Thinking it is not dying
you're afraid of.

626
01:02:51,003 --> 01:02:53,050
It's living.

627
01:02:53,051 --> 01:02:54,713
Live with me.

628
01:02:54,714 --> 01:02:56,602
Just this once.

629
01:02:56,603 --> 01:03:00,399
Just this moment. Live with me.

630
01:03:40,509 --> 01:03:42,843
- What's his position?
- We lost him.

631
01:03:44,381 --> 01:03:48,380
He headed into the mountains.
We can't get reception up there.

632
01:03:48,381 --> 01:03:51,162
Hack into one of the
military satellites.

633
01:03:57,597 --> 01:03:58,845
Yes.

634
01:03:58,846 --> 01:04:01,212
You think we're playing games here,
Mr. Minister?

635
01:04:01,213 --> 01:04:03,133
I don't know what
you're talking about.

636
01:04:03,134 --> 01:04:06,525
I'm talking about a black car full of
your incompetent operatives.

637
01:04:06,526 --> 01:04:09,660
<i>One more move like that and you will
never see your daughter again.</i>

638
01:04:09,661 --> 01:04:11,163
I want to hear her voice.

639
01:04:11,198 --> 01:04:13,918
When the contract
is signed and delivered.

640
01:04:13,919 --> 01:04:16,413
I will not sign until I hear her voice.

641
01:04:16,414 --> 01:04:19,101
You are in no position
to play hardball, Mr. Minister.

642
01:04:19,102 --> 01:04:22,102
Well, neither are you, Mr. Johnson.

643
01:04:22,719 --> 01:04:24,702
<i>Yes, I know who you are.</i>

644
01:04:24,703 --> 01:04:27,837
And I can assure you, if anything
happens to my daughter...

645
01:04:27,838 --> 01:04:29,822
...I will use all the power I have.

646
01:04:29,823 --> 01:04:35,518
I will hunt you down and make you pay
in a most hideous way for this.

647
01:04:38,303 --> 01:04:39,961
We have to move now.

648
01:04:45,408 --> 01:04:47,513
Pick up, Frank. Pick up.

649
01:05:03,360 --> 01:05:06,393
I'm in Ibiza. Making holiday.

650
01:05:11,009 --> 01:05:13,376
<i>Someone hands me
glass of champagne.</i>

651
01:05:13,377 --> 01:05:15,579
<i>I drink.</i>

652
01:05:15,809 --> 01:05:18,655
<i>Then I don't feel so good.</i>

653
01:05:30,594 --> 01:05:34,073
<i>I go to bathroom, and next thing,
I'm awake in the car.</i>

654
01:05:34,754 --> 01:05:38,878
I ask him, "Where is this?"
He tells me he's just a transporter.

655
01:05:42,114 --> 01:05:44,862
He's pretty good driver.

656
01:05:45,283 --> 01:05:47,834
Not like you good.

657
01:05:48,386 --> 01:05:54,178
I tell him, "Please.
My father a really powerful man.

658
01:05:54,179 --> 01:05:58,754
Big influence. Knows a lot of people.
Let me call him. "

659
01:05:58,755 --> 01:06:01,471
<i>He's afraid.
He's never done this before.</i>

660
01:06:01,763 --> 01:06:06,338
It's supposed to be simple.
Pick up, drop off. Easy money.

661
01:06:06,339 --> 01:06:10,015
He's been told no calls,
never leave car.

662
01:06:10,147 --> 01:06:12,286
But I convince him.

663
01:06:13,636 --> 01:06:15,676
<i>I call.</i>

664
01:06:15,844 --> 01:06:18,180
<i>But before I say to my father
where we are...</i>

665
01:06:18,181 --> 01:06:19,904
Inside the car. Come on!

666
01:06:25,828 --> 01:06:27,900
<i>We get away, but...</i>

667
01:06:30,468 --> 01:06:33,188
There's people shooting at us. Why?

668
01:06:33,189 --> 01:06:35,460
Why they shooting at us?

669
01:06:35,461 --> 01:06:40,517
He says they shoot because
we didn't go according to plan.

670
01:06:40,518 --> 01:06:44,996
I said, "Okay, that's the old plan.
What's new plan?"

671
01:06:44,997 --> 01:06:47,681
He says he has a friend.

672
01:06:55,750 --> 01:06:58,433
And then I met you.

673
01:07:00,645 --> 01:07:03,678
And then I feel it's gonna be okay.

674
01:07:07,622 --> 01:07:10,240
You didn't even know me.

675
01:07:10,471 --> 01:07:12,005
Of course I don't know you.

676
01:07:12,006 --> 01:07:15,834
I talk about feelings, not knowing.

677
01:07:17,414 --> 01:07:22,050
Well, if you was feeling that way, you
sure had a funny way of showing it.

678
01:07:22,310 --> 01:07:25,958
Better for a woman
to have a little mystery to her.

679
01:07:25,959 --> 01:07:27,846
No?

680
01:07:28,872 --> 01:07:30,780
No.

681
01:07:30,791 --> 01:07:34,435
Yes. Just a little.

682
01:07:59,304 --> 01:08:01,856
He's back on the radar, sir.

683
01:08:06,216 --> 01:08:08,233
- Yeah.
- Where the hell are you?

684
01:08:08,234 --> 01:08:09,703
On the way to Bucharest.

685
01:08:09,704 --> 01:08:11,525
Not any longer.

686
01:08:13,034 --> 01:08:16,961
New coordinates: 3-7-13.

687
01:08:52,875 --> 01:08:55,045
Excuse me, Mr. Minister.

688
01:08:55,211 --> 01:08:57,482
Sorry, just a minute.

689
01:08:57,483 --> 01:08:59,970
Inspector Tarconi, from Marseilles.

690
01:09:01,036 --> 01:09:03,403
Well, not exactly Marseilles...

691
01:09:03,404 --> 01:09:06,410
...but a small town to the east...
- What do you want, inspector?

692
01:09:06,411 --> 01:09:08,484
- A word with you.
- I have no time.

693
01:09:08,972 --> 01:09:10,859
It's about your daughter.

694
01:09:18,317 --> 01:09:22,244
Odessa, Frank. My country.

695
01:09:22,413 --> 01:09:25,860
You take me home. Thank you.

696
01:09:27,372 --> 01:09:29,674
What happened to Bucharest?

697
01:09:30,733 --> 01:09:35,849
- Change of plans.
- It's a good change. I prefer Odessa.

698
01:09:36,013 --> 01:09:38,019
Yeah.

699
01:09:38,444 --> 01:09:41,644
I was looking forward to that fish
with the carrots myself.

700
01:09:41,645 --> 01:09:43,756
Oh, it's much better here.

701
01:09:43,757 --> 01:09:46,924
- You know chicken Kiev?
- I do.

702
01:09:46,925 --> 01:09:49,228
I know restaurant here.

703
01:09:49,229 --> 01:09:50,701
Best in the world.

704
01:09:50,702 --> 01:09:55,053
The chicken's so fresh.
And the butter, when it's coming out...

705
01:09:55,054 --> 01:09:57,573
Like you cannot believe, it's so nice.

706
01:10:02,574 --> 01:10:05,389
You know what I feel like now?

707
01:10:07,470 --> 01:10:09,543
Hungry.

708
01:10:12,078 --> 01:10:14,217
Safe.

709
01:10:21,071 --> 01:10:26,188
It's going to end up like the movies,
this happily ever after?

710
01:10:29,231 --> 01:10:32,206
By tonight, this is all
gonna be a fading memory.

711
01:10:32,207 --> 01:10:36,516
It's gonna be you and me,
laughing over chicken Kiev.

712
01:10:38,224 --> 01:10:40,012
Liar.

713
01:10:56,913 --> 01:10:59,399
<i>Mr. Minister, an update, please.</i>

714
01:11:00,561 --> 01:11:05,296
I am ready to sign the contract
once I speak to my daughter.

715
01:11:06,577 --> 01:11:09,806
Hello? Hello?

716
01:11:09,873 --> 01:11:12,873
Have that pen ready.
I'll call you back.

717
01:11:20,690 --> 01:11:23,242
We are closing the noose, Frank.

718
01:11:23,346 --> 01:11:26,737
Well, when it closes, make sure
no one tries to drag me out of the car.

719
01:11:26,738 --> 01:11:28,679
You know what this is about yet?

720
01:11:29,393 --> 01:11:32,113
The girl. Her father.

721
01:11:32,114 --> 01:11:34,738
Large amounts of toxic waste.

722
01:11:34,739 --> 01:11:37,455
It is a trade.
His signature for her life.

723
01:11:38,642 --> 01:11:41,777
I have a reputation
to uphold here, inspector.

724
01:11:41,778 --> 01:11:45,074
One hundred percent
successful delivery rate.

725
01:11:45,075 --> 01:11:48,871
Am I detecting a little attachment?

726
01:11:48,883 --> 01:11:54,130
That is not the Frank I know. With his
rules, no names, no attachment.

727
01:11:54,131 --> 01:11:56,716
Why is everyone so concerned
about my rules?

728
01:11:56,915 --> 01:12:02,763
Frank, I always suspected
you are a romantic at heart.

729
01:12:04,179 --> 01:12:05,607
Anything else?

730
01:12:06,292 --> 01:12:08,083
<i>Where is the rendezvous?</i>

731
01:12:08,084 --> 01:12:10,419
<i>I'll call you back.</i>

732
01:12:14,484 --> 01:12:17,203
- Yeah.
- We're almost at the end, Frank.

733
01:12:17,204 --> 01:12:20,138
- Just give me the coordinates.
- No more coordinates.

734
01:12:20,340 --> 01:12:22,579
The road you're on.

735
01:12:22,580 --> 01:12:24,336
Make your first left.

736
01:12:24,629 --> 01:12:26,537
I'd like to know where I'm going.

737
01:12:30,644 --> 01:12:33,491
You'll know when you get there.

738
01:13:01,814 --> 01:13:04,464
Don't worry. We got them
right where we want them.

739
01:13:10,647 --> 01:13:12,691
My compliments, Frank.

740
01:13:12,726 --> 01:13:16,686
Our trust in your abilities
was well deserved.

741
01:13:16,759 --> 01:13:18,929
<i>If you could please
send the girl out.</i>

742
01:13:20,087 --> 01:13:21,878
She's coming.

743
01:13:21,879 --> 01:13:24,366
I'm not coming.

744
01:13:24,567 --> 01:13:26,806
They need you. They won't kill you.

745
01:13:26,807 --> 01:13:29,523
But they will kill you.

746
01:13:29,527 --> 01:13:33,138
Do I look like a man who came halfway
across Europe to die on a bridge?

747
01:13:34,807 --> 01:13:36,235
Do I?

748
01:13:44,663 --> 01:13:47,510
We don't have all day, Frank.

749
01:13:50,713 --> 01:13:52,407
Look how many of them.

750
01:13:52,408 --> 01:13:54,456
They have all the guns.

751
01:13:54,457 --> 01:13:56,048
How it's gonna be okay?

752
01:13:59,576 --> 01:14:01,300
Tell you over dinner.

753
01:14:02,425 --> 01:14:04,050
Now, go.

754
01:14:04,505 --> 01:14:05,879
Go.

755
01:14:05,880 --> 01:14:08,019
Kiss me.

756
01:14:23,738 --> 01:14:25,647
Go.

757
01:14:29,850 --> 01:14:32,784
You're gonna get me killed. Now, go.

758
01:14:55,996 --> 01:14:58,581
Get to her, you bastard.

759
01:15:22,429 --> 01:15:24,883
Better now, darling?

760
01:15:42,109 --> 01:15:44,018
Finish him.

761
01:16:02,270 --> 01:16:04,954
No! Frank!

762
01:16:15,294 --> 01:16:17,886
His beloved car will be his grave.

763
01:16:17,887 --> 01:16:21,116
Leaves it, he blows. Stays, he drowns.
Let's get out of here.

764
01:16:31,424 --> 01:16:33,813
- Tarconi.
- They have the girl.

765
01:16:34,560 --> 01:16:38,047
Frank, we are trying to track him
through the phone signal.

766
01:16:38,048 --> 01:16:40,666
- Where are you?
- In a lake.

767
01:16:41,376 --> 01:16:43,416
A lake?

768
01:16:43,424 --> 01:16:45,407
Can you be more specific?

769
01:16:45,408 --> 01:16:47,098
There's a dam.

770
01:16:48,224 --> 01:16:50,271
- A dam?
- I know the place, sir.

771
01:16:50,272 --> 01:16:52,224
- How far?
- Ten minutes at least.

772
01:16:52,225 --> 01:16:54,176
Frank, we'll be there in 10 minutes.

773
01:16:54,177 --> 01:16:55,872
Can you make it any faster?

774
01:16:55,873 --> 01:16:58,556
- We'll do our best.
- Thank you.

775
01:18:51,686 --> 01:18:53,595
Buy tickets for all of us.

776
01:18:53,702 --> 01:18:55,237
Where to?

777
01:18:55,238 --> 01:18:59,205
Anywhere this train is going. We need
to keep moving for half an hour.

778
01:18:59,206 --> 01:19:01,540
Why don't we just keep
driving around?

779
01:19:06,471 --> 01:19:08,293
Another day.

780
01:19:21,734 --> 01:19:24,603
Sir! There!

781
01:19:40,647 --> 01:19:44,839
- Out. Out!
- Everybody out!

782
01:19:44,840 --> 01:19:46,661
- Come on.
- Move!

783
01:19:46,920 --> 01:19:48,862
Move, quick!

784
01:20:05,641 --> 01:20:07,714
- Mr. Minister?
- Yes.

785
01:20:07,850 --> 01:20:09,954
Someone wants to talk to you.

786
01:20:10,762 --> 01:20:13,794
- Papa.
- Are you all right?

787
01:20:17,706 --> 01:20:19,778
Don't sign.

788
01:20:19,978 --> 01:20:23,392
What you have is 15 minutes.

789
01:20:29,898 --> 01:20:32,681
- You ever find out what this is about?
- Garbage.

790
01:20:32,682 --> 01:20:34,623
How much garbage are we talking?

791
01:20:35,050 --> 01:20:38,665
Enough to pollute half the country
for a hundred years.

792
01:20:38,666 --> 01:20:40,095
Try it again.

793
01:20:59,500 --> 01:21:02,955
For a modern woman,
you are very uninformed.

794
01:21:02,956 --> 01:21:05,029
This is the new world.

795
01:21:05,676 --> 01:21:08,267
There are no more countries.
That's old think.

796
01:21:08,268 --> 01:21:11,691
There are just economic realities.
Profit and loss.

797
01:21:11,692 --> 01:21:14,508
Efficiency and waste.

798
01:21:14,509 --> 01:21:16,898
Think global, not local.

799
01:21:17,196 --> 01:21:19,530
Think this.

800
01:21:33,261 --> 01:21:35,628
- Yes?
- Where are we?

801
01:21:42,446 --> 01:21:44,354
We're almost there.

802
01:21:46,414 --> 01:21:47,916
Where?

803
01:21:47,917 --> 01:21:50,339
Here. He is on a train.

804
01:21:50,478 --> 01:21:52,910
- And where are we?
- Here.

805
01:21:52,911 --> 01:21:55,495
We can get units there.

806
01:21:56,623 --> 01:21:58,825
That's a good idea. Do that.

807
01:22:02,159 --> 01:22:05,356
Oh, Frank, come on.

808
01:22:35,472 --> 01:22:38,128
Mr. Minister, I assure you,
everything is in order.

809
01:22:38,163 --> 01:22:40,336
I'm sure it is.

810
01:22:40,337 --> 01:22:44,493
- If there are any problems...
- I know you will solve them.

811
01:22:44,912 --> 01:22:47,213
Now, if you don't mind...

812
01:23:15,889 --> 01:23:19,751
You might not believe this,
but I am, at heart, a pacifist.

813
01:23:20,497 --> 01:23:22,952
I hate violence.

814
01:23:24,403 --> 01:23:27,565
It creates more problems
than it solves.

815
01:23:28,659 --> 01:23:31,856
You know, I never wanted
to do any of this.

816
01:23:32,818 --> 01:23:36,210
A client asked me to obtain a result...

817
01:23:36,211 --> 01:23:38,417
...so I went about creating
an environment...

818
01:23:38,418 --> 01:23:40,306
...with the least amount
of bloodshed.

819
01:23:40,307 --> 01:23:43,122
No one wanted to cooperate.
Not you, not the first driver...

820
01:23:43,123 --> 01:23:47,214
...not your father, not the
recently deceased Frank Martin.

821
01:23:47,827 --> 01:23:50,762
Everyone wanted to fight.

822
01:24:05,045 --> 01:24:06,669
What's so funny?

823
01:24:07,380 --> 01:24:10,248
Hearing a dead man talking.

824
01:26:17,210 --> 01:26:19,481
One more step, Frank.

825
01:26:19,482 --> 01:26:21,424
Come on. One more.

826
01:27:02,780 --> 01:27:04,508
Look.

827
01:27:04,509 --> 01:27:05,970
It's over.

828
01:27:06,364 --> 01:27:08,437
Two minutes to 9. He signed.

829
01:27:11,613 --> 01:27:14,099
Oh, my God.

830
01:27:18,684 --> 01:27:20,538
No, Frank. No, no.

831
01:27:59,391 --> 01:28:02,205
It's over, Frank. It's over.

832
01:28:02,943 --> 01:28:05,789
Mission accomplished.
You and the girl are free to go.

833
01:28:06,847 --> 01:28:09,278
Matter of fact,
I'm so impressed by your talent...

834
01:28:09,279 --> 01:28:11,070
...I'd like to offer you a position.

835
01:28:11,071 --> 01:28:14,714
I'd like to offer you one.
Permanently disabled.

836
01:28:32,737 --> 01:28:34,208
I hate to waste talent.

837
01:28:34,209 --> 01:28:36,608
But I really don't think
we'd make a very good fit.

838
01:28:36,643 --> 01:28:38,517
That's right.

839
01:29:00,865 --> 01:29:02,392
No!

840
01:29:05,698 --> 01:29:09,211
We wouldn't fit, but you and the
bracelet were made for each other.

841
01:29:13,122 --> 01:29:14,811
No, no.

842
01:29:25,187 --> 01:29:26,648
No!

843
01:29:27,747 --> 01:29:29,404
No!

844
01:29:44,003 --> 01:29:46,272
You're doing the right thing.

845
01:30:04,836 --> 01:30:06,974
Valentina.

846
01:30:11,429 --> 01:30:13,086
Valentina.

847
01:30:22,501 --> 01:30:25,020
Am I in heaven?

848
01:30:26,157 --> 01:30:27,457
No...

849
01:30:27,557 --> 01:30:30,208
Looks more like we're in hell.

850
01:30:30,214 --> 01:30:32,260
I don't care.

851
01:30:32,261 --> 01:30:34,334
As long as we're there together.

852
01:30:45,702 --> 01:30:46,917
Yes?

853
01:30:46,918 --> 01:30:50,431
Mr. Minister,
your daughter is in good hands.

854
01:30:51,398 --> 01:30:53,404
Thank you.

855
01:31:06,856 --> 01:31:09,350
- What are you doing?
- What you said, the right thing.

856
01:31:09,351 --> 01:31:12,646
And now, if you'll excuse me,
I have a conference to address...

857
01:31:12,647 --> 01:31:15,654
...on the dangers of doing business
with people like you.

858
01:31:15,655 --> 01:31:17,084
Thank you very much.

859
01:31:35,016 --> 01:31:36,200
Is the launch ready?

860
01:31:36,201 --> 01:31:38,916
- It's on the water, sir, waiting.
- Time to leave.

861
01:31:39,145 --> 01:31:40,901
- Grab the log.
- Okay.

862
01:31:58,761 --> 01:32:01,705
I just don't understand it.

863
01:32:01,706 --> 01:32:03,785
When I was a boy, my father and I...

864
01:32:03,786 --> 01:32:07,177
...used to pull fish out of
this very spot all day long.

865
01:32:07,178 --> 01:32:09,218
Times change, inspector.

866
01:32:09,322 --> 01:32:11,459
As do people.

867
01:32:13,866 --> 01:32:16,201
You referring to me?

868
01:32:17,226 --> 01:32:19,714
I don't think that's
a very accurate statement.

869
01:32:20,138 --> 01:32:22,473
I drive the same car,
live in the same house.

870
01:32:22,474 --> 01:32:26,915
Oh, I was not referring
to your car or your house.

871
01:32:29,195 --> 01:32:31,658
The sea is so restful.

872
01:32:31,659 --> 01:32:33,250
Is lunch ready yet?

873
01:32:33,996 --> 01:32:37,354
Mademoiselle, there is
a certain progression to things.

874
01:32:37,355 --> 01:32:40,746
In order to eat the lunch,
you first have to catch the lunch.

875
01:32:40,747 --> 01:32:43,082
And if we keep talking
instead of concentrating...

876
01:32:43,083 --> 01:32:44,554
...we're gonna catch nothing.

877
01:32:44,555 --> 01:32:48,330
I have better idea. Why we
don't skip catching of lunch...

878
01:32:48,331 --> 01:32:50,379
...and go right to eating of lunch?

879
01:32:50,380 --> 01:32:53,611
I know wonderful place
just up coast from here...

880
01:32:53,612 --> 01:32:56,553
...where they make fish stew.
Incredible.

881
01:32:56,588 --> 01:33:02,599
They use tomatoes and onions,
and little amount of wild lavender.

882
01:33:02,796 --> 01:33:04,811
What kind of wine?

883
01:33:04,812 --> 01:33:06,950
Pink. From south.

884
01:33:07,724 --> 01:33:09,932
A Chteauneuf, perhaps.

885
01:33:09,933 --> 01:33:12,460
- Chilled?
- Of course, chilled.

886
01:33:12,461 --> 01:33:14,796
And for dessert?
