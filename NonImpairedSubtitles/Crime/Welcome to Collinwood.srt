1
00:02:24,122 --> 00:02:29,651
I'm the wrong guy! I'm the wrong guy!
I'm the wrong guy! I'm the wrong guy!

2
00:02:29,828 --> 00:02:32,729
Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey.

3
00:02:32,898 --> 00:02:37,130
Your mother's a whore! Man! Come on.

4
00:02:58,123 --> 00:03:01,092
What's so fucking funny?

5
00:03:01,660 --> 00:03:05,152
Hey, keep laughing at me
and I'll kill you.

6
00:03:05,330 --> 00:03:09,892
I'm not laughing at you.
I'm laughing at life.

7
00:03:10,068 --> 00:03:12,434
Life ain't funny, so quit it!

8
00:03:12,604 --> 00:03:18,338
Listen to me.
I'm gonna tell you a secret.

9
00:03:18,977 --> 00:03:22,208
A secret so you can laugh too.

10
00:03:23,415 --> 00:03:26,509
Listen to me, you fool!

11
00:03:26,685 --> 00:03:31,713
I am gonna tell you something
that will change your life.

12
00:03:35,026 --> 00:03:39,395
You remember the old brick building
on Chester Avenue?

13
00:03:39,564 --> 00:03:43,591
- There's a million brick buildings on...
- No! No.

14
00:03:43,769 --> 00:03:46,101
The old flour factory.

15
00:03:47,038 --> 00:03:50,439
With the bright gold brick.

16
00:04:01,319 --> 00:04:02,752
What about it?

17
00:04:04,956 --> 00:04:07,948
I'll wait for you
and think of you every night.

18
00:04:08,126 --> 00:04:09,855
Listen to me, idiot.

19
00:04:11,496 --> 00:04:16,490
I need a Mullinski.
I want you to go back to Collinwood.

20
00:04:16,668 --> 00:04:21,037
Find someone to take the rap
for this car fiasco for me.

21
00:04:21,373 --> 00:04:23,864
I'll pay 15 grand.

22
00:04:24,075 --> 00:04:28,375
Fifteen grand?
Where are you gonna get 15 grand?

23
00:04:29,181 --> 00:04:31,445
From a shoebox.

24
00:04:32,517 --> 00:04:34,747
What shoebox?

25
00:04:36,588 --> 00:04:38,886
It's under my bed.

26
00:04:40,759 --> 00:04:44,422
You said we couldn't get married,
because you were broke.

27
00:04:44,596 --> 00:04:50,831
You lied to me, you son of a bitch.
Of all the shit you've put me through.

28
00:04:51,002 --> 00:04:54,233
If we'd used that money,
I'm stuck in here.

29
00:04:54,406 --> 00:04:57,466
- You want that? You want me in jail?
- No. No.

30
00:04:57,642 --> 00:05:02,238
- I want you to buy me a ring.
- All right. Listen to what I'm saying.

31
00:05:02,414 --> 00:05:07,647
I heard about a job in here.
The greatest job I've ever heard of.

32
00:05:07,819 --> 00:05:12,813
It'll give us all the money we could
ever use for the rest of our lives.

33
00:05:13,091 --> 00:05:17,687
If I get you a Mullinski,
will you marry me?

34
00:05:18,063 --> 00:05:19,690
Will you?

35
00:05:20,165 --> 00:05:23,464
All right! All right! On my mother.

36
00:05:24,436 --> 00:05:29,464
All right. I'll get you a Mullinski.

37
00:05:36,681 --> 00:05:40,981
- Who is it?
- It's Rosalind, Toto. Open up.

38
00:05:41,386 --> 00:05:42,978
Toto no here!

39
00:05:43,154 --> 00:05:45,520
No Toto.

40
00:05:47,259 --> 00:05:50,353
- How'd you find me?
- This is where you live?

41
00:05:50,528 --> 00:05:54,965
- Well, how do you know?
- It's me, Rosalind. Cosimo's woman.

42
00:05:55,133 --> 00:06:00,400
Sweet Jesus. He gave me up, didn't he?
I tried to get him out of that car.

43
00:06:00,572 --> 00:06:04,269
- I swear to God!
- Relax, old man. He didn't give you up.

44
00:06:04,442 --> 00:06:06,808
- He needs your help.
- How can I help?

45
00:06:06,978 --> 00:06:12,177
I'm like a caged animal! All day,
cops everywhere. I don't eat or sleep.

46
00:06:12,350 --> 00:06:17,117
The cops can only get you through
Cosimo, and he'd never give you up.

47
00:06:17,289 --> 00:06:20,190
But you've gotta help.
He needs a Mullinski.

48
00:06:20,358 --> 00:06:23,020
I can't Mullinski for him.
I already did.

49
00:06:23,194 --> 00:06:28,154
- The judge would lock us both up!
- No. He needs you to find a Mullinski.

50
00:06:30,135 --> 00:06:32,797
- The offer's 15 grand.
- Fifteen.

51
00:06:32,971 --> 00:06:37,931
I spent a year in isolation for him,
he only gave me five.

52
00:06:38,109 --> 00:06:42,773
Yeah, well, somebody told him
about a job in there.

53
00:06:42,948 --> 00:06:46,884
A job? What kind of job?

54
00:06:47,452 --> 00:06:49,920
Can I trust you?

55
00:06:52,557 --> 00:06:55,822
He says it could be his Bellini.

56
00:06:59,464 --> 00:07:01,625
- Fifteen for a Mullinski?
- Yeah.

57
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:04,769
- What's the charge?
- Grand-theft auto.

58
00:07:04,936 --> 00:07:07,564
Shit, forget it. I can't do it.

59
00:07:08,673 --> 00:07:13,076
What are you talking about?
Grand-theft's easy, I did it.

60
00:07:14,746 --> 00:07:20,981
It's not the time. It's my mother.
She'd die on the spot.

61
00:07:21,152 --> 00:07:25,452
Well, she'd die happier knowing
you had 15 grand in your pocket.

62
00:07:25,623 --> 00:07:28,820
What are you, sick?
Forget it. I'm not doing it.

63
00:07:28,994 --> 00:07:32,930
Look, you're gonna turn down
15 grand for a Mullinski?

64
00:07:33,098 --> 00:07:36,625
What do you want from me?
I told you, I can't do it.

65
00:07:36,801 --> 00:07:40,567
Let Cosimo rot.
He's the biggest asshole in Collinwood.

66
00:07:40,739 --> 00:07:44,732
- Look, swear you'll never repeat this.
- What?

67
00:07:44,909 --> 00:07:49,642
Swear. Cosimo will kill me
if he ever finds out I told you.

68
00:07:49,814 --> 00:07:54,842
- Come on. All right, I swear.
- Cosimo, he's got this big job lined up.

69
00:07:55,020 --> 00:07:58,786
- Big? How big?
- Huge.

70
00:07:59,224 --> 00:08:02,284
All that's huge about Cosimo
is his fat head.

71
00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:06,419
- He says it's his Bellini.
- His Bellini.

72
00:08:06,598 --> 00:08:09,897
Everybody in this neighborhood's
got a Bellini.

73
00:08:10,068 --> 00:08:11,729
- Hey, Mickey.
- What's up?

74
00:08:11,903 --> 00:08:14,963
- How's your Bellini?
- Watch your mouth.

75
00:08:16,908 --> 00:08:19,877
No. Cosimo's...

76
00:08:20,045 --> 00:08:21,979
Cosimo's is real.

77
00:08:22,147 --> 00:08:24,911
A lifer gave it up to him
in the joint.

78
00:08:25,083 --> 00:08:29,247
That's why he's so desperate
to find a Mullinski.

79
00:08:30,555 --> 00:08:32,489
A lifer gave it up to him?

80
00:08:32,657 --> 00:08:35,922
You see, I figure...

81
00:08:37,429 --> 00:08:43,834
...if we help Cosimo get out, maybe we
can get in on some of the action.

82
00:08:45,904 --> 00:08:51,536
- How much action?
- Cosimo says 300 grand.

83
00:08:52,811 --> 00:08:56,577
- Holy shit.
- Yeah. I know.

84
00:08:58,416 --> 00:08:59,906
I don't know.

85
00:09:00,251 --> 00:09:06,451
Look. How much money did you wake up
with in your pocket this morning?

86
00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:10,925
Fifty-five cents.

87
00:09:11,396 --> 00:09:14,331
What have you got to lose?

88
00:09:17,735 --> 00:09:22,104
- Do you know Leon?
- That Negro who hides his sister?

89
00:09:22,273 --> 00:09:25,640
He's a nut case,
but he always needs dough.

90
00:09:25,810 --> 00:09:29,712
I can't do it.
My sister's engaged to be married.

91
00:09:29,881 --> 00:09:35,842
Jesus. This will pay for the wedding.
This is 10 grand we're talking about.

92
00:09:36,087 --> 00:09:41,047
Fiancé's a snob from the suburbs. If I
go to the pen, there'd be no wedding.

93
00:09:41,226 --> 00:09:44,787
This is crazy. How hard can it be
to find a Mullinski?

94
00:09:44,963 --> 00:09:48,228
You gotta know somebody
that could use the dough.

95
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:52,927
- Friends who'd be better off in jail.
- What the fuck does that mean?

96
00:09:53,104 --> 00:09:55,038
It means what it means.

97
00:09:56,174 --> 00:10:01,237
Screw Cosimo. Why give a shit?
He's the biggest asshole in Collinwood.

98
00:10:01,412 --> 00:10:07,214
- Yeah, but he's got a Bellini.
- What are you doing to me?

99
00:10:07,385 --> 00:10:11,651
- You wanna find a Mullinski?
- Every sucker's got a Bellini.

100
00:10:11,823 --> 00:10:15,782
This one's legit.
A lifer gave it up to him.

101
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:19,123
Anybody who helps
can get a piece of the action.

102
00:10:19,297 --> 00:10:22,755
- Why didn't the lifer pull it?
- Because he's a lifer.

103
00:10:22,934 --> 00:10:25,266
He went to the pen before he could.

104
00:10:26,371 --> 00:10:30,068
A genuine Bellini?
You swear on your mother?

105
00:10:31,176 --> 00:10:34,441
I swear on my mother.

106
00:10:35,780 --> 00:10:38,180
Goddamn.

107
00:10:39,417 --> 00:10:41,282
You fellows know Riley?

108
00:10:46,958 --> 00:10:49,392
What the fuck are you doing?

109
00:10:51,029 --> 00:10:54,157
I just got the baby to sleep
after three hours.

110
00:10:54,332 --> 00:10:56,892
- I'm sorry.
- It's all right.

111
00:10:58,169 --> 00:11:03,607
It's all right.
It's just... He's very neurotic.

112
00:11:03,775 --> 00:11:05,640
Noises...

113
00:11:08,213 --> 00:11:10,943
...and bright lights upset him terribly.

114
00:11:11,115 --> 00:11:15,882
I'm sorry. If you're here for pictures,
I'm out of the business.

115
00:11:16,487 --> 00:11:22,119
My wife's in the pen. I had to sell my
cameras to buy diapers and baby food.

116
00:11:22,460 --> 00:11:25,361
But if you're interested...

117
00:11:26,130 --> 00:11:29,622
...I'm selling drinking glasses.
I paint them.

118
00:11:29,801 --> 00:11:34,534
They're all hand-painted. By me.
If you're interested.

119
00:11:37,842 --> 00:11:42,074
- Sweet Jesus, I am so broke.
- Funny you should mention that.

120
00:11:42,247 --> 00:11:43,874
You got a job?

121
00:11:44,482 --> 00:11:48,578
Cosimo needs a Mullinski.
He's willing to pay 10 large for it.

122
00:11:48,753 --> 00:11:50,516
Ten large?

123
00:11:56,961 --> 00:11:59,020
That's two bucks a jar.

124
00:11:59,564 --> 00:12:03,330
I can't. It's impossible.
I got the kid, for chrissake.

125
00:12:03,501 --> 00:12:05,560
- Where's your wife?
- Seneca.

126
00:12:05,737 --> 00:12:09,366
They gave her a year for fraud.
Even with a newborn.

127
00:12:09,540 --> 00:12:13,533
They set her fine at 1000 bucks.
Christ.

128
00:12:13,711 --> 00:12:20,173
We're so broke, she had to do the time.
A year for 1000 bucks. I know.

129
00:12:20,351 --> 00:12:24,082
You know, they've got
a fabulous nursery at Seneca.

130
00:12:24,255 --> 00:12:27,122
- I was born there.
- We're in a real pickle.

131
00:12:27,292 --> 00:12:30,193
We need a Mullinski.
We need one fast.

132
00:12:30,361 --> 00:12:32,192
You're not gonna...

133
00:12:32,597 --> 00:12:36,294
You're not gonna get an ex-con
for grand-theft auto.

134
00:12:36,467 --> 00:12:41,427
You need somebody with a clean record
so the judge'll go easy on him.

135
00:12:41,606 --> 00:12:44,769
Jesus, it's not like
the old days anymore.

136
00:12:47,245 --> 00:12:48,906
You guys know Pero?

137
00:12:53,651 --> 00:12:56,586
Baby coming through.
Baby coming through.

138
00:12:56,754 --> 00:13:00,212
Baby coming through.
Baby-fucking-coming through.

139
00:13:00,391 --> 00:13:02,552
Here, let's put this on you.

140
00:13:10,802 --> 00:13:13,635
- Are you out of your lunatic mind?
- What?

141
00:13:13,805 --> 00:13:17,866
- Cosimo won't share his job with them.
- It was an accident.

142
00:13:18,042 --> 00:13:22,172
- I was talking, my mouth slipped.
- He's gonna kill me for this.

143
00:13:22,347 --> 00:13:23,814
He's gonna kill me.

144
00:13:23,981 --> 00:13:28,418
- I'm not going to prison for that fool.
- Not even for 15 grand?

145
00:13:28,586 --> 00:13:32,283
- You told us 10.
- My boxing career's about to take off.

146
00:13:32,457 --> 00:13:35,221
- You're fighting a priest.
- A tough priest.

147
00:13:35,393 --> 00:13:38,885
You rather I fight a woman?
Tonight, I fight a priest.

148
00:13:39,063 --> 00:13:41,588
Tomorrow, I fight
for the championship.

149
00:13:41,766 --> 00:13:45,896
- This jackass is our last chance.
- Maybe sweeten the deal.

150
00:13:46,070 --> 00:13:50,404
He's this close. I say we go
equal parts on another 1000.

151
00:13:50,575 --> 00:13:53,237
A thousand dollars
would get my wife out.

152
00:13:53,411 --> 00:13:58,075
What is it with you guys?
You gotta spend money to make money.

153
00:13:58,249 --> 00:14:02,982
Man, she's right. If we don't
spring Cosimo, there's no job.

154
00:14:04,655 --> 00:14:07,818
We'll go 16,000 on the deal.

155
00:14:09,227 --> 00:14:14,358
I don't need it. When my career takes
off, I'm spinning on this neighborhood.

156
00:14:14,532 --> 00:14:17,365
- Mahlovic, you're up! Let's go.
- All right.

157
00:14:17,535 --> 00:14:19,662
See you after the fight.

158
00:14:19,837 --> 00:14:22,328
Pero, buma- ye!

159
00:14:22,507 --> 00:14:25,772
I'm so pretty. I'm so pretty. Come on!

160
00:14:43,294 --> 00:14:48,425
Cosimo Cosanawowski, for attempted
grand-theft auto, you are sentenced to...

161
00:14:48,599 --> 00:14:52,968
- Stop the proceedings! Stop!
- Order. Order.

162
00:14:53,137 --> 00:14:57,130
- Hold on! Hear me out. Hear me out.
- Remove him.

163
00:14:59,143 --> 00:15:04,911
Please, Your Honor, I'm here to confess.
That man is innocent.

164
00:15:05,283 --> 00:15:09,185
Your Honor, I can no longer live
with the guilt.

165
00:15:09,387 --> 00:15:14,086
It was me who was stealing that car.
I confess.

166
00:15:14,258 --> 00:15:19,890
My brother Cosimo, Saint Cosimo,
as he's known on the streets...

167
00:15:20,298 --> 00:15:23,825
...was only trying to stop me.
I told him:

168
00:15:24,001 --> 00:15:26,868
"Cosimo, I mean to steal this car.

169
00:15:27,038 --> 00:15:32,032
I am a car thief.
I steal cars. By myself."

170
00:15:33,144 --> 00:15:35,408
I'm gonna kill you!

171
00:15:35,580 --> 00:15:39,414
- Wait. Hold on.
- You're the worst Mullinski ever.

172
00:15:40,885 --> 00:15:45,822
Not only that, you added six months.
Six months to my sentence.

173
00:15:45,990 --> 00:15:50,324
Six months. Six months.
Who cares about six months?

174
00:15:50,495 --> 00:15:53,020
I just got three fucking years, man!

175
00:15:53,197 --> 00:15:57,759
I want my money back. Otherwise,
you're gonna die in this prison.

176
00:15:57,935 --> 00:15:59,994
- Get out.
- Fine. I don't care.

177
00:16:00,171 --> 00:16:03,231
I don't care about anything anymore.

178
00:16:03,608 --> 00:16:06,133
What's the matter with you?

179
00:16:06,511 --> 00:16:09,275
Come on. Prison is easy, you puss.

180
00:16:09,447 --> 00:16:14,282
No. You don't understand.
I betrayed my brother.

181
00:16:14,452 --> 00:16:16,215
Maybe he deserved it.

182
00:16:16,387 --> 00:16:22,417
He's dying, you jackass!
My real brother, Bleeko, is dying.

183
00:16:23,094 --> 00:16:25,494
Now he'll have to die alone.

184
00:16:26,731 --> 00:16:30,292
Just last week he said to me...

185
00:16:30,468 --> 00:16:36,805
He said, " Pero, be there for me
in the final moments...

186
00:16:36,974 --> 00:16:41,775
...when death has me in its deadly grip.
Don't let me go it alone."

187
00:16:41,946 --> 00:16:46,679
I swore to him I wouldn't,
but I betrayed him.

188
00:16:46,851 --> 00:16:50,378
For a lousy 16 grand.

189
00:17:08,606 --> 00:17:14,169
- You're a sick bastard.
- No, I'm not laughing at you.

190
00:17:14,345 --> 00:17:19,783
I'm laughing at... You wanna hear
something gonna cheer you up?

191
00:17:19,951 --> 00:17:22,886
You know that old building
on Chester Avenue?

192
00:17:23,054 --> 00:17:27,457
- There's a million old buildings.
- The factory with the gold brick.

193
00:17:27,625 --> 00:17:31,686
- What about it?
- It's not a flour factory anymore.

194
00:17:31,929 --> 00:17:36,161
Half became apartments.
Guess what's on the other half?

195
00:17:36,334 --> 00:17:37,995
I don't care.

196
00:17:39,236 --> 00:17:42,330
- A jewelry shylock.
- So what?

197
00:17:42,506 --> 00:17:46,237
So my cellmate, the bricklayer,
he split the building.

198
00:17:46,410 --> 00:17:48,469
- He pulled a Krazner.
- What?

199
00:17:48,646 --> 00:17:50,341
You know, a Krazner.

200
00:17:50,514 --> 00:17:54,883
He mortared the wall between
the apartment and the shylock...

201
00:17:55,052 --> 00:17:58,146
...with sand and water.
You can push through it.

202
00:17:58,322 --> 00:18:03,316
Shylock's a big shot. The bricklayer
said he has a fortune in that safe.

203
00:18:03,494 --> 00:18:06,292
You still have to break
into the apartment.

204
00:18:06,464 --> 00:18:11,595
That's the beauty of it. Nobody lives
there. It's vacant. You can walk in.

205
00:18:11,869 --> 00:18:14,667
You're a bigger jackass
than everyone says.

206
00:18:14,839 --> 00:18:18,468
- What are you talking about?
- lf this job is so good...

207
00:18:18,643 --> 00:18:21,510
...why didn't the old man
pull it himself.

208
00:18:21,746 --> 00:18:25,147
Two days before the job,
he fights with his wife.

209
00:18:25,316 --> 00:18:29,343
Shoots her dead. He's a lifer now,
so he gave me the job.

210
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:35,481
You were to spring me so I could
pull it. Now we're in the can together.

211
00:18:36,927 --> 00:18:39,157
- Funny shit, huh?
- Yeah, it is.

212
00:18:39,330 --> 00:18:42,731
- I mean, really funny, right?
- You have no idea.

213
00:18:44,435 --> 00:18:46,596
- You're free to go.
- Thanks.

214
00:18:46,771 --> 00:18:50,298
Where's he going?
You told me you had three years.

215
00:18:50,474 --> 00:18:54,205
You know, I did,
but the judge suspended the sentence.

216
00:18:55,179 --> 00:19:00,981
I'm gonna fucking kill you! You son
of a bitch. Your mother's a whore.

217
00:19:01,152 --> 00:19:05,179
- My mother's a what?
- A whore! Your mother's a whore!

218
00:19:14,799 --> 00:19:20,362
- Goddamn! Shit. Come to see me home?
- I want the money back.

219
00:19:20,538 --> 00:19:24,804
I did my job, baby. It's not
my fault the judge didn't buy it.

220
00:19:24,975 --> 00:19:29,810
- I'm dead if I don't get that money.
- Look who flew the coop.

221
00:19:29,980 --> 00:19:31,948
If it isn't a $ 16,000 man.

222
00:19:32,116 --> 00:19:37,213
We don't care what went wrong. We just
want our stake in the money back.

223
00:19:37,388 --> 00:19:40,516
What's the fuck's the matter
with you people?

224
00:19:40,691 --> 00:19:43,683
- That money's mine.
- We don't want trouble.

225
00:19:53,003 --> 00:19:57,167
- You want me to take it out of your ass?
- Fuck you!

226
00:19:59,076 --> 00:20:00,941
You want more, funny boy?

227
00:20:01,112 --> 00:20:02,977
- Christ.
- Where's the money?

228
00:20:03,147 --> 00:20:06,275
- I don't have it.
- Well, you better find it.

229
00:20:08,786 --> 00:20:11,482
- Jesus Christ!
- Just give us the money.

230
00:20:11,655 --> 00:20:13,953
I gave the money to my debtors.

231
00:20:14,125 --> 00:20:17,822
- All 16,000?
- I still owe another 5 to Leo the Lip.

232
00:20:18,996 --> 00:20:23,558
- He's lying.
- Wait, wait. I got the Bellini.

233
00:20:23,734 --> 00:20:27,192
- I got Cosimo's Bellini.
- Bullshit. Stick him again.

234
00:20:27,371 --> 00:20:32,138
I swear to God! I told him I got
three years, and he gave it up to me.

235
00:20:32,309 --> 00:20:36,302
- So what?
- So I'll cut you in on it.

236
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:38,414
Equal shares. All of you.

237
00:20:38,582 --> 00:20:42,450
It's the greatest job I ever heard of.
A jewelry shylock.

238
00:20:42,620 --> 00:20:44,212
Let's hear it then.

239
00:20:44,388 --> 00:20:47,323
- I can't breathe.
- Let him up. Let him up.

240
00:20:51,462 --> 00:20:53,987
You watch yourself, fucker.

241
00:20:54,865 --> 00:20:56,355
Fuck.

242
00:21:01,372 --> 00:21:03,203
- I feel weak.
- Shit.

243
00:21:03,374 --> 00:21:05,569
Jesus, we killed him.

244
00:21:06,977 --> 00:21:10,174
The safe's on the second floor
of the pawnshop.

245
00:21:11,649 --> 00:21:14,743
The apartment next
to the pawnshop is empty.

246
00:21:15,886 --> 00:21:19,652
We break into the apartment,
smash a hole in the wall...

247
00:21:19,924 --> 00:21:23,621
...climb into the shylock's
and crack the safe.

248
00:21:26,130 --> 00:21:28,394
That's the easy part.

249
00:21:29,033 --> 00:21:33,595
Trouble is that building's like
a fortress. The front door's alarmed.

250
00:21:33,771 --> 00:21:37,070
The best way is through
the coal chute next door.

251
00:21:37,241 --> 00:21:39,971
Take the back fire escape to the roof.

252
00:21:40,144 --> 00:21:44,740
Then we drop to the apartment window,
and we cut it open.

253
00:21:45,482 --> 00:21:47,677
Anybody know a safecracker?

254
00:21:48,452 --> 00:21:53,822
- Jerzy Antwerp is the only one I know.
- Wait a minute. Hold him, would you?

255
00:21:55,392 --> 00:21:57,189
I got an idea.

256
00:21:57,561 --> 00:22:02,828
I was thinking, with a camera, I could
shoot the shylock opening the safe.

257
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,935
- We could get the combination.
- Brilliant.

258
00:22:06,203 --> 00:22:08,171
Where we gonna get a camera?

259
00:22:08,339 --> 00:22:14,005
We could pay a little visit
to a guy I know at the flea market.

260
00:22:19,483 --> 00:22:22,714
So, what are you hocking today, Riley?
Your kid?

261
00:22:22,887 --> 00:22:25,082
Treat me with more respect.

262
00:22:25,256 --> 00:22:29,852
It just so happens I came
into some money. I'm a buyer today.

263
00:22:30,027 --> 00:22:36,330
- It's nice. I like the browns.
- Yes, but what about the reds?

264
00:22:36,634 --> 00:22:39,831
What do you think? It's for my sister.

265
00:22:40,004 --> 00:22:41,835
Is there too much red?

266
00:22:42,006 --> 00:22:47,535
She's been institutionalized, and the
color red makes her bark like a dog.

267
00:22:48,379 --> 00:22:51,712
Yes, after all, I believe
there is too much red.

268
00:22:51,882 --> 00:22:55,545
I'm sorry, Oswald,
but your paintings are crap.

269
00:22:55,719 --> 00:22:57,744
Let's go to Sears.

270
00:23:03,027 --> 00:23:05,154
Okay. Here we go.

271
00:23:09,199 --> 00:23:11,133
- What is this?
- Sorry.

272
00:23:11,302 --> 00:23:13,896
I shot some footage of him
for his mom.

273
00:23:14,071 --> 00:23:15,834
He's a cute baby.

274
00:23:16,907 --> 00:23:20,343
That's his new food.
He's not taking to it too well.

275
00:23:20,511 --> 00:23:22,672
- I like it.
- Riley, come on.

276
00:23:22,846 --> 00:23:25,440
- It's good food.
- You're killing me.

277
00:23:25,616 --> 00:23:26,947
Here we go.

278
00:23:28,652 --> 00:23:33,021
- The Hassenfeffer 622.
- Is that good or bad?

279
00:23:33,190 --> 00:23:34,680
Neither.

280
00:23:37,194 --> 00:23:38,991
Okay, okay, watch this.

281
00:23:49,373 --> 00:23:52,467
- Seventy-eight.
- Seventy-seven.

282
00:23:52,743 --> 00:23:55,371
- Eight.
- Seventy-eight. Eight.

283
00:23:56,113 --> 00:23:58,775
- Whoa.
- Jesus Christ.

284
00:24:06,323 --> 00:24:08,655
- Seventy-seven.
- What's that number?

285
00:24:08,826 --> 00:24:10,521
Seventy-eight.

286
00:24:10,694 --> 00:24:15,131
- What is the number?
- It's an eight. Seventy-eight, eight.

287
00:24:15,299 --> 00:24:17,460
- That's great.
- We did nine takes.

288
00:24:17,634 --> 00:24:21,468
Every time, on the last number,
he does this.

289
00:24:21,638 --> 00:24:23,299
He's like a gimp.

290
00:24:23,974 --> 00:24:25,407
Sorry.

291
00:24:28,946 --> 00:24:31,005
So, what do you think?

292
00:24:32,549 --> 00:24:35,518
Well, as a film, it's a disaster.

293
00:24:35,786 --> 00:24:39,244
It's a documentary.
It's supposed to look like that.

294
00:24:42,059 --> 00:24:46,189
The good news is,
the safe is crackable.

295
00:24:47,231 --> 00:24:50,029
So how do we...? What do we...?

296
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:54,660
How do we do this?
Do I carry you on my back?

297
00:24:54,872 --> 00:24:59,172
This may be a shock, but I don't
go out in the field anymore.

298
00:24:59,343 --> 00:25:03,336
- See. What the hell's he doing here?
- I teach.

299
00:25:03,580 --> 00:25:06,413
For 500 bucks,
I show you how to do it.

300
00:25:06,583 --> 00:25:08,608
- 500 bucks?
- 500 bucks?

301
00:25:08,786 --> 00:25:10,447
Be quiet. The baby.

302
00:25:11,355 --> 00:25:17,453
We're all tapped out here. That's why
we're doing this job in the first place.

303
00:25:17,628 --> 00:25:20,859
- We'll cut you in.
- I don't take back-end money.

304
00:25:21,031 --> 00:25:26,526
- There's a fortune in that safe.
- Five hundred bucks, that's a deal.

305
00:25:26,937 --> 00:25:29,701
- My time is valuable.
- All right. Hold on.

306
00:25:29,873 --> 00:25:31,170
Hold your horses.

307
00:25:31,341 --> 00:25:34,310
Can you get us through a Krazner wall?

308
00:25:36,747 --> 00:25:39,477
Well, who do you think Krazner called?

309
00:25:42,152 --> 00:25:45,280
- All right. So then it's a deal.
- Good.

310
00:25:45,456 --> 00:25:47,788
Be at my place Saturday afternoon.

311
00:25:47,958 --> 00:25:51,894
If you'll excuse me,
I have a class to teach in Youngstown.

312
00:25:54,031 --> 00:25:59,492
Five hundred bucks? Did I mention I'm
trying to get my wife out of the clink?

313
00:25:59,670 --> 00:26:03,868
- Where can we get that kind of money?
- We could mug someone.

314
00:26:04,041 --> 00:26:06,475
There's gotta be something.

315
00:26:08,679 --> 00:26:10,772
I think I can get the money.

316
00:26:12,249 --> 00:26:18,279
- How much do you need?
- Just a small loan for a new suit.

317
00:26:18,622 --> 00:26:23,491
I met a nice girl.
I'm gonna ask her to marry me.

318
00:26:23,660 --> 00:26:25,787
You're getting married?

319
00:26:25,963 --> 00:26:28,989
- lf she says yes.
- So how much?

320
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:32,459
Five hundred dollars.

321
00:26:32,636 --> 00:26:36,970
Five hundred dollars?
It must be some suit.

322
00:26:37,141 --> 00:26:42,204
It's beautiful.
With buttons and shoes.

323
00:26:42,379 --> 00:26:47,180
Well, I hope she can make
an honest man out of you.

324
00:26:49,453 --> 00:26:51,785
At the usual interest?

325
00:26:52,523 --> 00:26:57,460
- At the usual interest.
- We're still better than Leo the Lip.

326
00:26:57,728 --> 00:27:00,595
There are many methods
to cracking a safe.

327
00:27:00,764 --> 00:27:06,669
Each method has an inverse relationship
between quickness and cleanness.

328
00:27:06,837 --> 00:27:12,935
The quickest is Lipchiski Method, named
for its originator, Theodore Lipchiski.

329
00:27:13,110 --> 00:27:18,742
The Lipchiski Method requires a stick
of dynamite and a match. Very quick.

330
00:27:19,016 --> 00:27:24,147
But as we learned when Lipchiski blew
himself up in Toledo, it's not clean.

331
00:27:24,321 --> 00:27:29,782
Hence, I teach the circular-saw method.

332
00:27:29,993 --> 00:27:35,454
Not the quickest, but the cleanest.
You and your loot will emerge unharmed.

333
00:27:35,632 --> 00:27:39,932
This is the method that I was taught.
It is what I believe in.

334
00:27:40,103 --> 00:27:45,439
- You want Lipchiski, go somewhere else.
- The police are here! They're coming!

335
00:27:45,609 --> 00:27:48,134
They were just here. Hide the safe.

336
00:27:48,312 --> 00:27:51,247
- Where?
- Hide the fucking safe. Throw it off.

337
00:27:51,415 --> 00:27:53,815
- We can't move it.
- The cops are here.

338
00:27:54,685 --> 00:27:57,677
You think that's funny?
You son of a bitch.

339
00:27:57,854 --> 00:27:59,685
You little son of a bitch.

340
00:27:59,856 --> 00:28:03,257
Fucking midget.
I'm gonna come out of this chair.

341
00:28:03,427 --> 00:28:08,126
I'm gonna fuck you up.
I hate that fucking kid.

342
00:28:11,134 --> 00:28:12,567
Where was I?

343
00:28:12,736 --> 00:28:16,672
- Circular...
- Circular saw. Circular-saw method.

344
00:28:18,242 --> 00:28:22,804
You take the saw like so:
You apply it like so:

345
00:28:22,980 --> 00:28:27,383
You crank it like so:
In three hours, you got your hole.

346
00:28:27,551 --> 00:28:29,018
- What time is it?
- Two.

347
00:28:29,186 --> 00:28:33,088
- We'll now begin a full demonstration.
- The police are here!

348
00:28:33,257 --> 00:28:37,193
Baby! Sgt. Babitch is here.
He's coming around the back.

349
00:28:37,361 --> 00:28:41,127
- He'll bury us. Hide the fucking safe!
- What? Where?

350
00:28:52,709 --> 00:28:55,576
All right, guys. Take five.
That's good.

351
00:28:55,746 --> 00:28:59,944
Babitch! What a surprise.
You caught us on laundry day.

352
00:29:00,117 --> 00:29:02,642
You sing while you launder?

353
00:29:02,819 --> 00:29:06,846
- Speak English.
- We're a chorus for the church.

354
00:29:07,024 --> 00:29:10,323
- Which church is that?
- It's the...

355
00:29:10,494 --> 00:29:12,325
We tour.

356
00:29:17,234 --> 00:29:20,533
Would you know anything
about a job in Youngstown?

357
00:29:20,737 --> 00:29:24,036
A safe with a hole
about the size of your head.

358
00:29:25,242 --> 00:29:26,869
Where's Youngstown?

359
00:29:30,380 --> 00:29:32,177
Now, wait a minute here.

360
00:29:34,718 --> 00:29:37,118
I know all you guys.

361
00:29:37,954 --> 00:29:40,081
You're all from Collinwood.

362
00:29:42,259 --> 00:29:44,250
And you're all bums.

363
00:29:46,863 --> 00:29:50,856
You're Pero Mahlovic, aren't you?
I knew your brother.

364
00:29:51,034 --> 00:29:55,596
He was a shitty fighter,
which is more than I can say for you.

365
00:29:55,772 --> 00:29:59,401
- What's your angle here, Mahlovic?
- I'm the tenor.

366
00:29:59,576 --> 00:30:01,669
You're a joker, huh?

367
00:30:02,279 --> 00:30:06,375
Well, you keep laughing, champ.
All the way to the pen.

368
00:30:09,486 --> 00:30:15,391
If a job goes down in the next few
weeks, I'll know whose asses to string.

369
00:30:19,162 --> 00:30:20,595
Jesus.

370
00:30:22,399 --> 00:30:24,833
You better watch your back, boys.

371
00:30:26,370 --> 00:30:28,838
Where have you been?
My kid's starving.

372
00:30:29,039 --> 00:30:34,136
- The bus never came. I had to walk.
- Down you go. Good boy.

373
00:30:34,344 --> 00:30:37,279
Give me a square,
and I'll forget about it.

374
00:30:37,447 --> 00:30:41,747
The shylock comes at 6.
He opens up at 7.

375
00:30:41,918 --> 00:30:43,442
Good luck.

376
00:30:44,354 --> 00:30:46,549
Hey, give me a light.

377
00:30:56,466 --> 00:30:59,162
Jesus, she's a live one.

378
00:31:04,074 --> 00:31:05,405
Yeah.

379
00:31:33,403 --> 00:31:37,066
What the fuck is this, man?

380
00:31:38,642 --> 00:31:42,669
- Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!
- What the fuck is this?

381
00:31:43,313 --> 00:31:49,411
My best friend's cousin told me
the old ladies are the shylock's aunts.

382
00:31:51,421 --> 00:31:53,787
They're getting senile.

383
00:31:54,591 --> 00:31:58,357
So he moved them in next door
to keep an eye on them.

384
00:32:00,030 --> 00:32:04,228
- The girl's their maid.
- The maid, huh?

385
00:32:04,601 --> 00:32:08,560
Well, don't worry.
I once seduced the first lady.

386
00:32:12,976 --> 00:32:16,810
You sure this isn't gonna
make you jealous or anything?

387
00:32:16,980 --> 00:32:18,709
You're a piece of work.

388
00:32:18,882 --> 00:32:23,649
As hard as you find it to believe,
I think you're a pig.

389
00:32:36,733 --> 00:32:39,600
- Shit.
- You're a real pizda. You know that?

390
00:32:39,769 --> 00:32:42,033
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

391
00:32:42,339 --> 00:32:47,936
- Baby, where you going in such a hurry?
- Your mama teach you how to walk?

392
00:32:48,111 --> 00:32:52,138
Whoa, slow down, sugar.
Give a little love to a black man.

393
00:32:52,315 --> 00:32:53,907
Whoa, whoa.

394
00:32:54,784 --> 00:32:58,413
Look at that. Baby got an ass
like bubble-gum ice cream.

395
00:32:58,588 --> 00:33:00,249
The kind we like to lick.

396
00:33:00,423 --> 00:33:04,382
Why don't you leave the girl alone,
you street bums.

397
00:33:04,561 --> 00:33:07,121
Scram, before we lay one on you.

398
00:33:14,538 --> 00:33:18,634
- I'll carve you like a turkey, honky.
- Put the knife away.

399
00:33:18,808 --> 00:33:20,275
Hit me.

400
00:33:20,443 --> 00:33:22,070
Put the knife...

401
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:26,672
- Don't hit me no more.
- Hurry up. Go get her.

402
00:33:26,850 --> 00:33:28,841
- Are you okay?
- Go get her.

403
00:33:29,019 --> 00:33:32,853
Miss! Miss, I don't mean any harm.

404
00:33:33,290 --> 00:33:35,952
Miss. Are you all right, miss?

405
00:33:36,126 --> 00:33:40,119
That was quite an experience.
Every day, I say to myself:

406
00:33:40,297 --> 00:33:45,200
" Pero, you're a lucky man. Your father
could afford a private school...

407
00:33:45,368 --> 00:33:50,396
...where among gaining a degree in
learning, you also mastered boxing."

408
00:33:50,574 --> 00:33:55,375
- That was quite a punch you threw.
- It was just a couple of bums.

409
00:33:55,545 --> 00:34:00,380
- I wanted to make sure you're okay.
- I'm fine. Now excuse me, I'm late.

410
00:34:00,917 --> 00:34:05,411
You're late? That's funny. So am I.
Which direction are you going?

411
00:34:05,589 --> 00:34:08,752
- This way.
- That's funny. So am I.

412
00:34:09,125 --> 00:34:12,322
- What are you late for?
- I'm meeting my boyfriend.

413
00:34:12,495 --> 00:34:16,158
- He's a doctor.
- A doctor. Really? What do you do?

414
00:34:16,333 --> 00:34:20,429
Me? I don't work.
I shop. I play tennis.

415
00:34:20,604 --> 00:34:23,334
Oh, really? Well, I'm a salesman.

416
00:34:23,506 --> 00:34:25,974
Congratulations. What do you sell?

417
00:34:26,142 --> 00:34:31,011
All sorts of things.
Big things. Expensive.

418
00:34:31,181 --> 00:34:33,706
- You from around here?
- No, Collinwood.

419
00:34:33,883 --> 00:34:38,616
Even though I could afford more,
I live humbly. I like humble people.

420
00:34:38,788 --> 00:34:43,885
For instance, if you were, say,
I don't know, a maid and not an heiress...

421
00:34:44,060 --> 00:34:47,188
...I'd still think you were
just as pretty.

422
00:34:47,364 --> 00:34:50,231
Hey, what's happening, young blood?

423
00:34:51,768 --> 00:34:54,999
Crazy kids.
That's a joke we play on each other.

424
00:34:55,171 --> 00:34:56,968
So where do you live?

425
00:34:57,140 --> 00:35:02,237
I live in an apartment with my aunts,
but my boyfriend's building me a house.

426
00:35:02,412 --> 00:35:05,404
- The doctor?
- No, the other boyfriend.

427
00:35:05,849 --> 00:35:08,317
You have another boyfriend?

428
00:35:08,485 --> 00:35:12,615
Yeah, I have lots of boyfriends.
I think it's best that way.

429
00:35:16,059 --> 00:35:20,223
- So you going to ask me out, or what?
- I thought...

430
00:35:20,397 --> 00:35:22,297
What about your boyfriends?

431
00:35:22,465 --> 00:35:26,458
They understand I'm a liberated woman.
How's Sunday?

432
00:35:26,636 --> 00:35:30,072
- Sure.
- All right.

433
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:36,406
- We'll meet at your house?
- Yeah, we can't. It's being...

434
00:35:36,579 --> 00:35:37,910
...deloused.

435
00:35:38,081 --> 00:35:40,549
- There's a street carnival.
- Yeah.

436
00:35:40,717 --> 00:35:43,618
- On St. Clair.
- Okay, yeah, 4:00, then.

437
00:35:43,787 --> 00:35:47,723
- In front of the church.
- In front of the church.

438
00:35:48,391 --> 00:35:50,120
Okay.

439
00:35:50,293 --> 00:35:52,124
Okay.

440
00:35:55,932 --> 00:35:57,900
- Okay.
- Bye.

441
00:36:00,503 --> 00:36:04,337
I'm gonna kill that son of a bitch.

442
00:36:06,176 --> 00:36:10,476
I'm gonna kill that son of a bitch.

443
00:36:18,755 --> 00:36:21,451
I'm gonna kill that son of a bitch.

444
00:36:21,624 --> 00:36:24,149
I'm gonna kill that...

445
00:36:36,639 --> 00:36:39,767
Hey, I don't want to miss my bus now.

446
00:36:52,155 --> 00:36:54,919
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

447
00:36:57,327 --> 00:36:59,955
Look, a fun house!
I love fun houses.

448
00:37:00,130 --> 00:37:04,726
Hey, if it's fun you want,
it's fun you get.

449
00:37:12,408 --> 00:37:14,399
Where did you go?

450
00:37:15,578 --> 00:37:18,012
Which one is you? Where are you?

451
00:37:18,181 --> 00:37:21,412
Guess you'll just have
to kiss me and find out.

452
00:37:21,584 --> 00:37:23,142
Come here.

453
00:37:23,319 --> 00:37:25,082
Come here.

454
00:37:29,793 --> 00:37:31,727
Where you going?

455
00:37:34,297 --> 00:37:38,028
- I'm gonna kill you, you son of a bitch!
- Cosimo! What the...?

456
00:37:40,737 --> 00:37:43,638
Want something, baby?

457
00:37:43,807 --> 00:37:46,503
- Jesus Christ, where's Mahlovic?
- Why?

458
00:37:46,676 --> 00:37:48,541
- Didn't you hear?
- What?

459
00:37:48,711 --> 00:37:53,045
- Cosimo broke out of the joint!
- There goes Cosimo!

460
00:37:53,216 --> 00:37:56,947
- I'll kill you! Your mother's a whore!
- He's got a gun!

461
00:37:59,756 --> 00:38:01,246
You sick bastard!

462
00:38:01,424 --> 00:38:04,359
- You stole my Bellini!
- Wait, wait!

463
00:38:05,295 --> 00:38:08,196
You puta! I'll spit on you!

464
00:38:08,364 --> 00:38:11,697
- I'll spit on all of you!
- Baby, please. Relax.

465
00:38:11,868 --> 00:38:14,962
I got it all planned out.
We can all share.

466
00:38:15,138 --> 00:38:17,038
You traitorous whore!

467
00:38:25,582 --> 00:38:28,415
Listen to me,
and listen to me good, okay?

468
00:38:28,585 --> 00:38:33,249
This job is mine! Anybody tries
to take it, I'm gonna kill them.

469
00:38:33,423 --> 00:38:37,826
I'm gonna kill anybody!
Anybody!

470
00:38:42,932 --> 00:38:44,524
You okay?

471
00:38:44,701 --> 00:38:46,601
- He get you good?
- No.

472
00:38:46,769 --> 00:38:48,464
Just get away from me.

473
00:38:56,679 --> 00:38:58,374
Fuck him.

474
00:39:00,250 --> 00:39:02,013
Leon.

475
00:39:02,619 --> 00:39:05,850
Leon, stakeout. Let's go.

476
00:39:06,022 --> 00:39:08,820
- What do you want?
- I'm looking for Leon.

477
00:39:08,992 --> 00:39:11,961
- Leon ain't here.
- I'm sorry. I didn't know.

478
00:39:12,128 --> 00:39:14,494
I'll let him know you came by.

479
00:39:14,664 --> 00:39:17,428
Shit. I'm Basil.

480
00:39:17,967 --> 00:39:20,663
- What?
- Tell him Basil came by.

481
00:39:22,305 --> 00:39:24,136
I will.

482
00:39:24,307 --> 00:39:25,968
And you?

483
00:39:27,610 --> 00:39:29,635
Are...?

484
00:39:30,580 --> 00:39:33,913
Right. I'm Michelle.

485
00:39:34,083 --> 00:39:35,311
Leon's sister.

486
00:39:35,485 --> 00:39:40,286
- I'm Basil.
- I know. You said it, like, three times.

487
00:39:45,328 --> 00:39:46,818
That's a pretty ring.

488
00:39:47,363 --> 00:39:52,960
It's from my fiancé.
He's a salesman from the suburbs.

489
00:39:58,508 --> 00:40:00,169
So...

490
00:40:00,343 --> 00:40:01,970
...Basil...

491
00:40:02,645 --> 00:40:05,011
...you wanna come in?

492
00:40:18,728 --> 00:40:21,856
This place is kind of stale,
don't you think?

493
00:40:22,031 --> 00:40:26,161
Maybe we could, you know,
go to your place or something.

494
00:40:28,071 --> 00:40:33,634
- But my aunts will be there, so...
- So we'll stay in the living room.

495
00:40:33,810 --> 00:40:37,371
- No, I can't leave, really.
- Why not?

496
00:40:37,547 --> 00:40:39,981
- Because.
- Because what?

497
00:40:40,149 --> 00:40:44,381
- I told another date to meet me here.
- Another date?!

498
00:40:44,554 --> 00:40:49,719
I cannot be dating just one guy.
It'd be like I'm married or something.

499
00:40:49,892 --> 00:40:53,919
Dear God, woman!
All these other loves in your life.

500
00:40:54,097 --> 00:40:56,657
It's enough to make
a man feel impotent.

501
00:40:56,833 --> 00:40:59,734
If you ask me,
you should only be dating me.

502
00:40:59,902 --> 00:41:02,370
I'll date whoever I please.

503
00:41:02,538 --> 00:41:04,403
- Hello, Beddo.
- Hi, Carmela.

504
00:41:04,574 --> 00:41:08,806
- Hi. This is my date.
- lf you don't mind.

505
00:41:08,978 --> 00:41:13,347
This is your date?
What is this, a joke?

506
00:41:14,417 --> 00:41:16,817
Excuse us, please.

507
00:41:16,986 --> 00:41:19,079
Another polka heading your way.

508
00:41:19,255 --> 00:41:23,851
Here we go with something called
" My Little Darling."

509
00:41:27,063 --> 00:41:30,658
I'm starting to think
we should just forget this job.

510
00:41:30,833 --> 00:41:32,733
It's spinning out of control.

511
00:41:32,902 --> 00:41:35,996
This job's not spinning
out of control. You are.

512
00:41:36,172 --> 00:41:39,141
Try getting into her apartment,
not her pants.

513
00:41:39,308 --> 00:41:43,438
I've been trying to get in
that apartment for two weeks.

514
00:41:43,613 --> 00:41:48,641
- She's a tease. I don't understand her.
- You're falling in love with her.

515
00:41:48,818 --> 00:41:53,915
- I don't fall in love, sweetheart.
- Oh, please.

516
00:41:54,090 --> 00:41:56,490
It's all over your face.

517
00:42:02,865 --> 00:42:05,390
Motherfucker.

518
00:42:07,270 --> 00:42:09,636
- Hands off, midget.
- What did you say?

519
00:42:09,806 --> 00:42:11,933
- She's with me tonight.
- Really?

520
00:42:12,108 --> 00:42:15,839
- Yeah, really.
- Well, he's with me.

521
00:42:17,180 --> 00:42:19,341
Who is he, your pimp?

522
00:42:32,929 --> 00:42:36,797
Come on, come on.
Come on. Want some, tough guy?

523
00:42:38,367 --> 00:42:40,699
What the fuck are you doing?

524
00:42:40,870 --> 00:42:46,103
How could you lose your head over
this hussy? She's a maid, for chrissake!

525
00:42:49,645 --> 00:42:51,738
Wait, Carmela. Carmela.

526
00:42:51,914 --> 00:42:53,541
Carmela, wait a second!

527
00:42:53,716 --> 00:42:56,048
I'm sorry for the disturbance.

528
00:42:56,219 --> 00:42:59,382
But I was enjoying an evening
with my girlfriend...

529
00:42:59,555 --> 00:43:02,718
...when that mob attacked me.
- Get out of here.

530
00:43:03,893 --> 00:43:07,124
Pero Mahlovic. 122 Ivanhoe.

531
00:43:07,296 --> 00:43:11,596
- Sgt. Babitch, thank God you're here...
- Shut up.

532
00:43:12,935 --> 00:43:16,928
The way you're going,
I should have them reserve you a cell.

533
00:43:17,106 --> 00:43:21,440
You're such a kidder, Sgt. Babitch.
This is a very dangerous area.

534
00:43:21,611 --> 00:43:24,341
Don't get smart with me,
you little prick.

535
00:43:24,514 --> 00:43:29,213
- I will shit in you.
- Yeah. Yeah, I know. I know.

536
00:43:30,319 --> 00:43:33,152
I'll be seeing you around, champ.

537
00:43:35,825 --> 00:43:37,690
Okay, then.

538
00:43:38,628 --> 00:43:41,688
Maybe at the mixer next week?

539
00:43:46,335 --> 00:43:51,170
So that was very noble of you,
what you did tonight, you know.

540
00:43:51,340 --> 00:43:54,036
No one's ever fought
over me that much.

541
00:43:54,210 --> 00:43:58,010
Well, I can't help it.
I guess I feel compelled.

542
00:44:01,250 --> 00:44:04,185
Why did that girl say
those things about me?

543
00:44:04,353 --> 00:44:07,083
You know, she was jealous.

544
00:44:07,256 --> 00:44:09,053
Yeah.

545
00:44:11,594 --> 00:44:14,290
She was telling the truth.

546
00:44:15,531 --> 00:44:18,466
I'm really just a maid.

547
00:44:18,634 --> 00:44:22,536
I thought because you were
a big salesman and everything...

548
00:44:22,705 --> 00:44:25,572
...you wouldn't like me as much, so...

549
00:44:25,741 --> 00:44:30,201
Please. We live in a democracy.
I don't care you're a maid.

550
00:44:30,379 --> 00:44:33,644
You can be anything you want.

551
00:44:33,816 --> 00:44:36,148
I know. I just...

552
00:44:36,319 --> 00:44:40,619
I don't know. I was just being silly.
I'm a silly liar.

553
00:44:40,790 --> 00:44:44,021
You're not silly.
You're not silly.

554
00:44:45,161 --> 00:44:48,619
- You know those old ladies I work for?
- Yeah.

555
00:44:48,798 --> 00:44:51,790
They're going out of town on Tuesday.

556
00:44:51,968 --> 00:44:57,531
And I live over on the West Side,
and I was thinking you could...

557
00:44:58,441 --> 00:45:01,569
...come over for a nice,
romantic dinner.

558
00:45:01,744 --> 00:45:05,840
I'd like that. I'd like that a lot.
What did you say?

559
00:45:06,015 --> 00:45:10,714
- That I'm off on Tuesday night and I...
- No, no, no. The old ladies.

560
00:45:10,886 --> 00:45:14,322
They're going to see
their mother in Steubenville.

561
00:45:14,490 --> 00:45:17,391
- You could come to my place.
- I could.

562
00:45:17,593 --> 00:45:21,029
Except, I have a date.

563
00:45:22,632 --> 00:45:26,295
- You have a date?
- With my brothers.

564
00:45:27,136 --> 00:45:30,367
We bowl. In a bowling league.

565
00:45:31,073 --> 00:45:33,871
I like to bowl. Could I come?

566
00:45:36,178 --> 00:45:38,237
It's a men's league.

567
00:45:39,815 --> 00:45:41,077
Yeah.

568
00:45:41,717 --> 00:45:45,118
But we could go out another night.
This weekend.

569
00:45:45,288 --> 00:45:49,987
- One more beer!
- Give me the money and get out!

570
00:45:51,827 --> 00:45:55,092
- Get the fuck out!
- Your mother's a whore!

571
00:45:55,264 --> 00:45:59,758
Carmela. Look at me.
Look at me for a second.

572
00:46:03,472 --> 00:46:05,201
I like you.

573
00:46:06,709 --> 00:46:08,677
I like you a lot.

574
00:46:09,145 --> 00:46:11,045
I like you too.

575
00:46:11,213 --> 00:46:14,148
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

576
00:46:18,187 --> 00:46:19,347
No!

577
00:46:19,522 --> 00:46:23,891
- No! Help! Help me!
- Give me the purse!

578
00:46:24,060 --> 00:46:26,324
Somebody help me!

579
00:46:39,608 --> 00:46:44,875
What a shitty way to go, huh?
Snatching a purse like a street punk.

580
00:46:45,047 --> 00:46:49,381
- Something ain't right in the world.
- He had a tough life.

581
00:46:49,552 --> 00:46:52,385
His mother was a whore.

582
00:46:52,555 --> 00:46:55,991
Sorry, I can't go in.
Death scares him.

583
00:46:58,127 --> 00:47:00,493
Excuse me, gentlemen. It's time.

584
00:47:01,864 --> 00:47:06,301
We ain't done nothing to Cosimo
that he ain't done to somebody else.

585
00:47:06,469 --> 00:47:11,304
- Still don't make it right, I guess.
- He was a good friend to me.

586
00:47:11,474 --> 00:47:14,500
What are you talking about?
He was an asshole.

587
00:47:14,677 --> 00:47:17,441
He'd screw his mother
and not think twice.

588
00:47:17,613 --> 00:47:19,240
Watch your mouth.

589
00:47:21,283 --> 00:47:24,047
It's not about him anyway.
Okay?

590
00:47:24,220 --> 00:47:27,951
It's about the job.
We worked hard for this thing.

591
00:47:28,124 --> 00:47:31,389
This is our dream
we've been building here.

592
00:47:32,561 --> 00:47:35,997
What's your son gonna eat?
Your guilt?

593
00:47:36,532 --> 00:47:40,866
Who'll pay for that wedding reception?
The memory of Cosimo?

594
00:47:42,271 --> 00:47:46,799
You're the poorest man I ever seen.
Did Cosimo ever help you out?

595
00:47:46,976 --> 00:47:50,468
And you. Are you gonna stay
a bum all your life?

596
00:47:50,646 --> 00:47:55,345
This is about the job, plain and simple.
We all need it to survive.

597
00:47:55,518 --> 00:48:00,080
And there ain't a goddamn thing
we can do to change that.

598
00:48:01,490 --> 00:48:03,549
How you doing?

599
00:48:05,127 --> 00:48:07,755
It's Antwerp.

600
00:48:07,930 --> 00:48:10,694
The tools are ready for tonight.

601
00:48:10,866 --> 00:48:16,896
They're in a duffle bag in a dumpster
in the back of your building. Got it?

602
00:48:17,506 --> 00:48:20,475
Why are you dressed like a priest?

603
00:48:20,776 --> 00:48:22,676
You're an idiot.

604
00:48:23,879 --> 00:48:25,369
You see that?

605
00:48:27,349 --> 00:48:31,479
Babitch smells blood.
Good luck.

606
00:48:36,392 --> 00:48:39,486
- He's putting the screws on us.
- Don't worry.

607
00:48:39,662 --> 00:48:42,995
We pull this job,
we'll all end up in the slammer.

608
00:48:43,165 --> 00:48:46,999
Don't worry about Babitch.
I'll take care of Babitch.

609
00:48:47,503 --> 00:48:50,301
My place, 8:00.

610
00:48:50,473 --> 00:48:52,634
We need this.

611
00:48:53,542 --> 00:48:55,442
We need this.

612
00:49:11,327 --> 00:49:13,693
What the fuck is this?

613
00:49:14,697 --> 00:49:18,633
It's almost $ 16,000.

614
00:49:20,703 --> 00:49:24,833
If something should happen
to go down tonight...

615
00:49:25,007 --> 00:49:27,532
...I'm hoping you'll forget...

616
00:49:28,611 --> 00:49:31,045
...you ever saw us.

617
00:49:36,886 --> 00:49:39,821
Stupid bastard.
What the fuck are you doing?

618
00:49:39,989 --> 00:49:43,015
Give me one good reason
not to bury your...!

619
00:49:43,192 --> 00:49:45,456
Give me one good reason.

620
00:49:45,628 --> 00:49:47,858
Babitch.

621
00:49:48,030 --> 00:49:53,400
What do you make?
What are you making, 30,000 a year?

622
00:49:53,702 --> 00:49:58,639
You live in a one-bathroom house, man.
You got four kids.

623
00:49:58,807 --> 00:50:03,744
You drive a Chevette. Your wife
rides the bus to work. For what?

624
00:50:03,913 --> 00:50:07,974
Just so you can protect some money
in some rich guy's safe?

625
00:50:09,151 --> 00:50:10,982
For what?

626
00:50:20,663 --> 00:50:22,426
Look at me.

627
00:50:23,999 --> 00:50:26,297
Nobody gets hurt.

628
00:50:26,835 --> 00:50:28,769
They won't get hurt.

629
00:50:39,648 --> 00:50:42,446
Now get off my porch.

630
00:50:48,424 --> 00:50:52,793
You know, you should get going.
Leon will be here any second.

631
00:50:52,962 --> 00:50:58,195
I don't know. I was thinking, maybe it's
time we tell your brother about us.

632
00:50:58,367 --> 00:51:00,301
Tell him what?

633
00:51:00,469 --> 00:51:02,460
About us.

634
00:51:03,005 --> 00:51:06,236
- That we're in love.
- You crazy?

635
00:51:06,408 --> 00:51:10,105
You think I'm gonna leave
my fiancé for you? Come on.

636
00:51:10,279 --> 00:51:13,339
- But we're in love.
- But he has a good job.

637
00:51:13,515 --> 00:51:16,643
He can get me out
of this neighborhood.

638
00:51:16,986 --> 00:51:20,888
- I can get you out of here.
- And take me where? To jail?

639
00:51:21,056 --> 00:51:23,490
What do you want, then?

640
00:51:23,659 --> 00:51:26,355
Your rich man?
Is that what you want?

641
00:51:26,528 --> 00:51:29,929
- Is that gonna make you happy?
- Yeah.

642
00:51:32,134 --> 00:51:33,692
No.

643
00:51:35,270 --> 00:51:37,067
I don't know.

644
00:51:37,406 --> 00:51:40,000
Well, what do you want?

645
00:51:41,944 --> 00:51:44,970
I want an honest man.

646
00:51:48,484 --> 00:51:50,213
You all right?

647
00:51:50,386 --> 00:51:52,047
I'm fine.

648
00:51:52,221 --> 00:51:56,021
- You want a drink?
- No. Thank you.

649
00:51:56,191 --> 00:51:57,715
What do you want?

650
00:51:57,893 --> 00:52:03,422
I need a favor. Only you can help me.
Will you watch him for me tonight?

651
00:52:03,599 --> 00:52:06,568
I don't want anything
to do with this anymore.

652
00:52:06,735 --> 00:52:11,297
I know you don't, but I don't
have a choice. I need the money.

653
00:52:11,473 --> 00:52:13,373
For him.

654
00:52:13,542 --> 00:52:15,737
I'm not good with children.

655
00:52:15,911 --> 00:52:17,708
Listen to me.

656
00:52:18,380 --> 00:52:20,439
I need your help.

657
00:52:21,650 --> 00:52:27,452
I think you're a good person, Rosalind.
You're one of the nicest people I know.

658
00:52:27,623 --> 00:52:29,921
And he needs that.

659
00:52:30,092 --> 00:52:31,889
And I think maybe...

660
00:52:32,061 --> 00:52:33,995
...you need that too.

661
00:52:46,008 --> 00:52:48,203
He's so tiny.

662
00:52:49,611 --> 00:52:51,272
Please.

663
00:52:54,149 --> 00:52:58,313
All right, but just for tonight.

664
00:52:58,487 --> 00:53:02,014
I put his things in that box.

665
00:53:07,863 --> 00:53:10,696
If he cries, whistle.

666
00:53:10,866 --> 00:53:14,632
Just whistle to him. He...

667
00:53:19,675 --> 00:53:22,644
Don't worry. You'll see him tomorrow.

668
00:53:38,227 --> 00:53:42,391
If they don't get here in five minutes,
we go without them.

669
00:53:42,564 --> 00:53:46,796
- I'm sorry. Sorry, I'm late.
- What's this? We don't need this.

670
00:53:46,969 --> 00:53:49,597
- It's not a prop. I was beaten.
- Beaten?

671
00:53:49,772 --> 00:53:50,761
By the cops?

672
00:53:50,939 --> 00:53:54,033
No. Oswald.
The guy we stole the camera from.

673
00:53:54,209 --> 00:53:57,508
I ran into him and his brother.
They broke my arm.

674
00:53:57,679 --> 00:54:00,648
- For stealing a camera?
- It was a good camera.

675
00:54:00,816 --> 00:54:03,649
This is a disaster. What are those?

676
00:54:03,986 --> 00:54:06,284
Hydrocodone...

677
00:54:06,455 --> 00:54:08,548
...bitar... Bitartrate.

678
00:54:08,724 --> 00:54:12,888
They're bullshit! I've taken bunches,
and they don't do shit.

679
00:54:13,061 --> 00:54:16,326
You took bunches of these?
What's wrong with you?

680
00:54:16,498 --> 00:54:18,466
You wanna go into a coma?

681
00:54:18,634 --> 00:54:22,035
Are you telling me
I don't love my own son?

682
00:54:23,939 --> 00:54:28,899
- He's out. Get him out of here.
- No, we can't do the job without him.

683
00:54:29,077 --> 00:54:32,478
- He's useless! Look at him!
- I'll take him home.

684
00:54:32,648 --> 00:54:35,116
What? We've gotta leave for the job.

685
00:54:35,284 --> 00:54:37,912
I've been meaning
to tell you something.

686
00:54:38,086 --> 00:54:41,453
You're not cutting me out!
You or any of you.

687
00:54:41,623 --> 00:54:44,285
I'm clean enough to go to the cops.

688
00:54:44,459 --> 00:54:49,089
I'm clean enough to go on this job,
aren't I? Aren't I?

689
00:54:49,264 --> 00:54:53,667
- You wouldn't. You wouldn't dare.
- You try me.

690
00:54:54,436 --> 00:54:56,097
Jesus.

691
00:54:56,271 --> 00:55:01,903
- Where the fuck hell is Leon?!
- I'll cut you, boy. I'll cut you good!

692
00:55:02,077 --> 00:55:03,908
Wait! You don't understand.

693
00:55:04,079 --> 00:55:07,810
She was a beautiful flower,
and you plucked her.

694
00:55:07,983 --> 00:55:11,111
- I'll make you bleed.
- Listen to me. I love her.

695
00:55:11,286 --> 00:55:15,052
- No. No. No.
- We wanna get married.

696
00:55:15,224 --> 00:55:19,718
She's already engaged!
And not to a goddamned dirty thief!

697
00:55:19,895 --> 00:55:23,524
I'm not a thief anymore. I quit.
I'm done with all this.

698
00:55:23,699 --> 00:55:27,294
- What did you say?
- That's what I wanted to tell you.

699
00:55:27,469 --> 00:55:29,460
I'm not going tonight.

700
00:55:29,638 --> 00:55:31,970
- I'm in love with Michelle.
- Shit!

701
00:55:32,140 --> 00:55:33,630
I wanna marry her.

702
00:55:33,809 --> 00:55:37,301
I have to be an honest man to do that.

703
00:55:38,580 --> 00:55:41,014
So I got a job.

704
00:55:41,783 --> 00:55:44,149
Jesus-fucking-Christ.

705
00:55:44,319 --> 00:55:46,651
This is a fucking fiasco.

706
00:55:51,827 --> 00:55:56,560
If you still wanna kill me, I'll be
at the nickel factory on St. Clair.

707
00:55:56,732 --> 00:55:57,994
I start tonight.

708
00:56:21,910 --> 00:56:26,973
This Bellini is starting to look
like a real fucking Kapuchnick.

709
00:56:27,149 --> 00:56:28,844
Watch your mouth!

710
00:56:29,017 --> 00:56:33,386
Are you insane?
You trying to jinx us?

711
00:56:33,555 --> 00:56:35,955
- Where are you going?
- To do the job.

712
00:56:36,124 --> 00:56:38,684
Can we do the job
with only four of us?

713
00:56:38,860 --> 00:56:42,796
At this point,
I don't give a good goddamn.

714
00:56:44,900 --> 00:56:46,390
Wait a minute, here.

715
00:56:48,537 --> 00:56:51,131
Let's calm down
and get our minds right.

716
00:56:51,306 --> 00:56:55,367
Minds right? You're standing there
with a fucking butcher's knife.

717
00:56:57,713 --> 00:56:58,702
Hi.

718
00:57:02,217 --> 00:57:05,186
- The girl, she's here! Out the window.
- Who?

719
00:57:05,354 --> 00:57:09,620
- The chick, the maid. Out the window!
- Oh, my God!

720
00:57:13,195 --> 00:57:16,687
- I'm not going out there.
- It's the only way. Go.

721
00:57:16,865 --> 00:57:20,596
There's no place to go
once you get out except down!

722
00:57:21,536 --> 00:57:24,403
Oh, my God!

723
00:57:24,573 --> 00:57:27,474
- Carmela.
- Pero?

724
00:57:27,642 --> 00:57:30,133
What a surprise.
How did you find...?

725
00:57:30,312 --> 00:57:33,247
How did you know where to find me?

726
00:57:34,816 --> 00:57:39,412
- Is this your place?
- No, this is much too modest for me.

727
00:57:39,588 --> 00:57:42,148
This is my brother's place.

728
00:57:42,324 --> 00:57:47,421
My brother Mico.
He's an artist. He likes the squalor.

729
00:57:47,596 --> 00:57:50,622
- Hi, Mico. I'm Carmela.
- Hello, young woman.

730
00:57:50,799 --> 00:57:54,428
I'd shake your hands,
but I'm inspecting these bottles.

731
00:57:55,303 --> 00:57:57,737
What's the matter?

732
00:57:57,906 --> 00:58:01,137
I'm afraid of...
I'm afraid of heights.

733
00:58:04,679 --> 00:58:08,240
I wanted to tell you something.

734
00:58:08,417 --> 00:58:12,319
I quit the old ladies tonight. Yeah.

735
00:58:13,455 --> 00:58:17,357
- You'll find another job.
- You would've been so proud of me.

736
00:58:17,526 --> 00:58:21,656
I never told you this before,
but they were really terrible to me.

737
00:58:21,830 --> 00:58:26,392
The things they would make me do.
They're incontinent, for God's sakes.

738
00:58:26,568 --> 00:58:32,564
But then I met you, and you made me
feel like I was worth something.

739
00:58:32,741 --> 00:58:37,041
I thought, " I have Pero. I don't have
to take this crap no more."

740
00:58:37,212 --> 00:58:41,273
So I called them "spoiled babies,"
and they fired me.

741
00:58:42,617 --> 00:58:44,744
They were so upset by it...

742
00:58:44,920 --> 00:58:48,947
...they canceled their stupid trip
to Steubenville tonight.

743
00:58:50,125 --> 00:58:51,956
What? What?

744
00:58:52,127 --> 00:58:56,894
Yeah, but then they went anyway
because they're stubborn old bats.

745
00:58:57,065 --> 00:59:01,161
And I kept the keys.
We should go back and wreck the place.

746
00:59:01,336 --> 00:59:04,100
My, my, my.
She didn't turn the keys in.

747
00:59:04,272 --> 00:59:06,672
Yeah, I heard her, Mico.

748
00:59:06,842 --> 00:59:11,575
You know what? You're very upset.
Maybe I should take you home.

749
00:59:11,746 --> 00:59:16,615
I don't wanna interrupt your bowling.
Won't you miss Pero at bowling?

750
00:59:16,785 --> 00:59:21,222
My arm's broken. I'm not going
to a fucking bowling match!

751
00:59:22,424 --> 00:59:26,360
Poor Mico.
He's so upset because he can't bowl.

752
00:59:42,477 --> 00:59:44,468
The window seems to be okay.

753
00:59:44,646 --> 00:59:49,606
If you have any more problems,
just give us a call. Hello.

754
00:59:50,785 --> 00:59:51,774
Okay.

755
00:59:51,953 --> 00:59:54,012
Am I dead?

756
00:59:54,189 --> 00:59:58,148
There you go.
So where's the next window?

757
01:00:02,063 --> 01:00:06,159
Next stop, 25th Street. Ohio City.

758
01:00:11,039 --> 01:00:13,837
I like your brother Mico.

759
01:00:14,175 --> 01:00:17,076
He's a little strange though.

760
01:00:17,445 --> 01:00:19,345
He had...

761
01:00:20,048 --> 01:00:23,108
...syphilis as a baby.

762
01:00:24,419 --> 01:00:25,977
Yeah.

763
01:00:27,455 --> 01:00:29,355
You know what?

764
01:00:30,292 --> 01:00:35,025
Now that I think about it, I wish
I didn't have those keys on me.

765
01:00:35,196 --> 01:00:38,393
If anything were to happen
while they were away...

766
01:00:38,567 --> 01:00:41,127
...those old crows,
they would blame me.

767
01:00:41,303 --> 01:00:45,740
How could they blame you?
You're a small girl. That's nonsense.

768
01:00:45,907 --> 01:00:49,172
- Could you do me a huge favor?
- Sure.

769
01:00:49,344 --> 01:00:52,211
Could you take the keys
on your way home...

770
01:00:52,380 --> 01:00:57,511
...and drop them off with the janitor?
I would just sleep so much better.

771
01:00:57,686 --> 01:01:01,918
But how could they blame you?
You're a small girl. That's...

772
01:01:02,090 --> 01:01:06,117
Oh, no. Pero, they're not here.
Oh, my God.

773
01:01:06,294 --> 01:01:09,559
I think I left them in the front door.
Oh, my God!

774
01:01:09,731 --> 01:01:12,962
Someone will rip that place off.
We gotta go back.

775
01:01:13,134 --> 01:01:14,999
- Driver!
- Wait. Wait. Wait.

776
01:01:15,170 --> 01:01:18,162
Hold on a second.
Let me take a look.

777
01:01:18,340 --> 01:01:22,071
- No, they're not in there.
- Look, there they are.

778
01:01:24,079 --> 01:01:29,847
- Thank you. They would have killed me.
- No wonder you couldn't find them.

779
01:01:30,018 --> 01:01:33,545
Look at all this lipstick.
One for every boyfriend?

780
01:01:33,722 --> 01:01:35,485
No.

781
01:01:37,092 --> 01:01:40,027
Well, there's only one from now on.

782
01:01:42,063 --> 01:01:45,294
Don't worry. You sleep good tonight.

783
01:01:45,467 --> 01:01:48,265
And I'll take the keys back. Okay?

784
01:01:48,436 --> 01:01:50,529
- Yeah.
- All right.

785
01:01:50,705 --> 01:01:53,435
You're always so good to me.

786
01:01:53,608 --> 01:01:56,839
No, you are. You're the best.

787
01:02:06,721 --> 01:02:10,248
- Where the fuck have you been?
- Did you get the keys?

788
01:02:10,525 --> 01:02:14,120
I couldn't get near them.
We gotta go in the old way.

789
01:02:14,295 --> 01:02:18,698
- But we're two hours behind.
- So let's move, then. Let's go.

790
01:02:38,486 --> 01:02:41,319
Motherfucker!

791
01:02:42,290 --> 01:02:44,155
Don't come down! Don't...

792
01:02:49,097 --> 01:02:51,725
- I can't swim!
- Goddamn!

793
01:02:51,900 --> 01:02:54,266
- I can't swim!
- Come on.

794
01:02:55,437 --> 01:02:56,995
Goddamn toothless...

795
01:02:59,607 --> 01:03:03,373
- Put your goddamn pants on.
- I'll catch pneumonia.

796
01:03:03,545 --> 01:03:07,242
Come on, let's go.
Quit messing around. Let's go.

797
01:03:19,527 --> 01:03:21,222
You ready?

798
01:03:31,773 --> 01:03:35,300
- Can you get it?
- No. Not yet.

799
01:03:35,477 --> 01:03:37,342
- Higher.
- Wait.

800
01:03:38,246 --> 01:03:39,736
Just a few more inches.

801
01:03:39,914 --> 01:03:41,779
One, two...

802
01:03:44,252 --> 01:03:46,311
I got it.

803
01:03:50,158 --> 01:03:53,150
- I think he bit off his tongue.
- No.

804
01:03:53,328 --> 01:03:56,024
No, it's right there.

805
01:03:58,266 --> 01:04:00,131
You want one of these?

806
01:04:02,504 --> 01:04:06,907
All right, we're losing time.
Let's go. Come on!

807
01:04:35,336 --> 01:04:36,826
Shit!

808
01:04:37,005 --> 01:04:38,495
Hot!

809
01:04:39,140 --> 01:04:41,472
Shit! Hot!

810
01:04:42,277 --> 01:04:44,177
Seems sturdy.

811
01:04:44,412 --> 01:04:45,970
I don't know.

812
01:04:46,381 --> 01:04:48,713
We should test it.

813
01:04:48,883 --> 01:04:50,544
Test it?

814
01:05:14,242 --> 01:05:16,802
- Chill, Riley! Chill!
- Go on. Go on.

815
01:05:30,158 --> 01:05:32,888
- Okay. Go.
- I can't.

816
01:05:33,061 --> 01:05:35,552
What? What do you mean, you can't?

817
01:05:35,730 --> 01:05:37,595
He's afraid of heights.

818
01:05:43,171 --> 01:05:45,036
You have to.

819
01:05:49,377 --> 01:05:51,572
I can't.

820
01:05:54,082 --> 01:05:57,381
Stop moving around, Toto. Stop it.

821
01:05:58,419 --> 01:06:00,444
Get your hands off my face!

822
01:06:00,622 --> 01:06:04,058
Stop moving around
like a fucking monkey.

823
01:06:04,392 --> 01:06:06,087
I'm scared.

824
01:06:15,136 --> 01:06:18,299
Get him off me! Get him off me!

825
01:06:18,473 --> 01:06:22,375
Oh, my God! Whatever about my ass
being all over his lap.

826
01:06:22,543 --> 01:06:25,842
You cause enough embarrassment
to last a year.

827
01:06:26,014 --> 01:06:28,278
When we went to your mother's...

828
01:06:28,449 --> 01:06:31,043
- My shorts are coming down.
- Shut up.

829
01:06:31,219 --> 01:06:36,987
And who came in? Your cousin,
Clarence. You were making eyes at him!

830
01:06:37,158 --> 01:06:39,626
That's so sick.
It's your own cousin!

831
01:06:39,794 --> 01:06:42,490
- What about Eddie?
- I'm going back inside.

832
01:06:42,664 --> 01:06:47,294
- lf you cause a scene, I'm leaving.
- We should stay out here all night!

833
01:06:47,468 --> 01:06:50,335
- Screw you!
- Where are you going? Come back.

834
01:06:51,739 --> 01:06:54,299
Get him off me! Get him off me!

835
01:06:56,210 --> 01:06:58,269
Go. Go.

836
01:07:00,348 --> 01:07:03,806
Next time I say to keep your pants on,
keep them on!

837
01:07:03,985 --> 01:07:06,044
It's this one.

838
01:07:08,156 --> 01:07:11,523
- It's this one. It's this one.
- Get the thingy.

839
01:07:34,082 --> 01:07:35,071
Come on.

840
01:07:45,526 --> 01:07:51,089
Oh, jeez. This place is like a palace.

841
01:08:02,944 --> 01:08:07,506
All right. It wasn't that heavy.
Stop being so goddamn dramatic.

842
01:08:07,682 --> 01:08:12,745
This is it. Guys, come on.
Come here. Hurry up.

843
01:08:12,920 --> 01:08:15,787
We can drill a pilot hole right there.

844
01:08:31,072 --> 01:08:33,165
This is it.

845
01:08:43,084 --> 01:08:45,245
- Fuck!
- Shit!

846
01:08:51,626 --> 01:08:54,652
Put this in.
Plug it up. Plug it up.

847
01:08:57,665 --> 01:09:02,295
- What a bizarre wall.
- You hit the plumbing, asshole.

848
01:09:03,805 --> 01:09:06,569
Oh, shit. Oh, shit. Oh, shit.

849
01:09:28,229 --> 01:09:33,098
Ms. Wiener, I'm in the apartment now,
and everything looks fine.

850
01:09:34,769 --> 01:09:38,500
Wait. There's some water
on the floor or something.

851
01:09:40,374 --> 01:09:42,535
Goddamn! Oh, fuck!

852
01:09:42,710 --> 01:09:45,679
No, it's the cat, Ms. Wiener.

853
01:09:45,847 --> 01:09:50,011
No, the cat peed on the floor again.

854
01:09:50,184 --> 01:09:53,984
No, I will not. No, I'm the janitor.
I'm not your maid.

855
01:09:54,155 --> 01:09:58,114
What's that? Yeah, a very nice
young man returned the keys...

856
01:09:58,292 --> 01:10:01,853
...for the girl
about three hours ago. Yeah.

857
01:10:02,029 --> 01:10:05,055
Yeah, okay.
I'll leave them right here. Good.

858
01:10:05,233 --> 01:10:06,825
Yeah, I'll lock up.

859
01:10:07,001 --> 01:10:10,300
Yeah, okay. Bye, Ms. Wiener.

860
01:10:10,738 --> 01:10:12,330
Bitch.

861
01:10:12,507 --> 01:10:15,840
Goddamn fucking cat.
I can't believe this shit.

862
01:10:16,010 --> 01:10:18,103
Crazy fucking people.

863
01:10:21,182 --> 01:10:23,343
Okay, okay...

864
01:10:23,518 --> 01:10:27,887
- You miserable son of a bitch.
- I had to return them for an alibi.

865
01:10:28,055 --> 01:10:32,355
- lf I kept them, she could finger me.
- You sold us out for a woman?

866
01:10:32,527 --> 01:10:36,122
They would've had her arrested
if the joint got robbed.

867
01:10:36,297 --> 01:10:40,927
So we had to crawl in like "aminals"?
We wasted half the night.

868
01:10:41,102 --> 01:10:44,401
Look. What's done is done.

869
01:10:44,739 --> 01:10:48,675
And all the arguing in the world
is not gonna change it.

870
01:10:48,843 --> 01:10:52,472
Now let's just shut up
and get out the Antwerp.

871
01:11:23,177 --> 01:11:25,407
Come on. Come on. It's giving.

872
01:11:25,580 --> 01:11:29,243
It's been giving
for the last 40 minutes.

873
01:11:33,554 --> 01:11:35,249
I need a breather, man.

874
01:11:36,891 --> 01:11:41,658
So how much do you
really think is in that safe?

875
01:11:41,829 --> 01:11:44,229
Well...

876
01:11:44,398 --> 01:11:49,836
...Cosimo said that the old man swore
to him that it was at least 300 grand.

877
01:11:50,938 --> 01:11:54,669
Goddamn. That's a lot of money.

878
01:11:54,842 --> 01:11:58,642
A person could live several lives
with that kind of money.

879
01:12:01,148 --> 01:12:05,175
I'm gonna buy a big loft
with my share of the loot.

880
01:12:06,153 --> 01:12:08,485
And one for my boy.

881
01:12:08,889 --> 01:12:13,155
I'll pay them off so he never has
to work a day in his life.

882
01:12:13,661 --> 01:12:16,596
I'm gonna move to the country.

883
01:12:17,698 --> 01:12:21,225
Houses there are so far apart
you can sit on your porch...

884
01:12:21,402 --> 01:12:24,303
...and read the newspaper
in your underwear.

885
01:12:26,407 --> 01:12:30,036
I'm gonna buy my wife
a new gravestone.

886
01:12:30,411 --> 01:12:33,346
You know, one that stands up.

887
01:12:33,581 --> 01:12:38,814
With little angels carved. In marble.

888
01:12:39,453 --> 01:12:41,887
So, what are you gonna do?

889
01:12:44,025 --> 01:12:47,051
I think I'm gonna build a gym.

890
01:12:47,228 --> 01:12:50,891
I know everybody thinks
I'm not much of a fighter...

891
01:12:51,065 --> 01:12:55,126
...but I think I'd be a good teacher,
you know, for the kids.

892
01:12:55,303 --> 01:12:58,761
Man, I can't wait another minute.

893
01:13:00,741 --> 01:13:04,199
Come on, guys,
let's go get the goddamn loot.

894
01:13:05,079 --> 01:13:09,379
Toto, get us some water.
It's like a jungle in here.

895
01:13:09,550 --> 01:13:12,212
All right, come on.

896
01:13:16,957 --> 01:13:19,255
Something's happening.

897
01:13:23,164 --> 01:13:25,064
It's giving.

898
01:13:26,901 --> 01:13:29,392
Shit. Here it comes.

899
01:13:32,973 --> 01:13:34,372
Here it comes.

900
01:13:45,519 --> 01:13:47,783
Yes! Yes. Yes.

901
01:13:54,795 --> 01:13:57,855
Good, sweet Jesus.
How did you get in there?

902
01:13:58,032 --> 01:14:00,762
I'm getting the water.

903
01:14:00,935 --> 01:14:02,869
My God.

904
01:14:04,171 --> 01:14:05,695
It's the kitchen.

905
01:14:05,873 --> 01:14:08,603
- The kitchen?
- What are you saying?

906
01:14:08,776 --> 01:14:11,176
It's the kitchen!

907
01:14:13,280 --> 01:14:18,047
Cosimo said the wall was in the
living room. This is the living room.

908
01:14:18,219 --> 01:14:23,714
How can this be the living room
if that's the fucking kitchen?!

909
01:14:24,358 --> 01:14:30,490
What do you think,
it's in the fucking closet?

910
01:14:34,602 --> 01:14:37,799
- Shit.
- You moron.

911
01:14:37,972 --> 01:14:40,600
You unbelievable idiot moron.

912
01:14:41,308 --> 01:14:45,802
How was I supposed to know
they had two living rooms?

913
01:14:45,980 --> 01:14:49,074
- Who has two living rooms?
- You should've looked.

914
01:14:49,250 --> 01:14:52,913
You should've looked
while we were busting our asses.

915
01:14:53,087 --> 01:14:56,056
- I got the water!
- Unbelievable hack.

916
01:14:56,223 --> 01:14:58,316
You poser. You've killed us.

917
01:14:58,492 --> 01:15:00,790
- Me?
- Yes, you. You've killed us.

918
01:15:00,961 --> 01:15:05,694
What are you talking about? We move
the crank in here and do it again.

919
01:15:05,866 --> 01:15:10,132
It's 3 a.m. We'd never get
through the wall and crack the safe.

920
01:15:10,304 --> 01:15:13,137
- We could drill fast.
- It's impossible!

921
01:15:13,307 --> 01:15:16,367
We'd drill our way
into the joint. It's over.

922
01:15:16,811 --> 01:15:21,111
We can still do it.
We can still do it.

923
01:15:21,482 --> 01:15:22,949
I'm telling you.

924
01:15:23,117 --> 01:15:26,985
- Leon, help me.
- We'll never make it, man.

925
01:15:30,391 --> 01:15:33,519
Hey, Toto. Come on.

926
01:15:35,896 --> 01:15:40,959
God, I needed that money.
I needed it so bad. You've ruined us.

927
01:15:41,135 --> 01:15:45,538
What are you talking about?
I did everything. From the start.

928
01:15:45,706 --> 01:15:51,804
I got the Bellini. I planned the job.
I wooed the girl. I paid off Babitch.

929
01:15:51,979 --> 01:15:56,382
I did everything. I gave everything
I had for this! Everything!

930
01:15:57,384 --> 01:16:01,684
You know what we did? We believed.

931
01:16:01,856 --> 01:16:05,155
You gave us hope
with your fucking Bellini.

932
01:16:05,326 --> 01:16:09,387
And then you ripped our hearts out,
and you smashed them.

933
01:16:09,563 --> 01:16:11,428
What is that? What?

934
01:16:11,599 --> 01:16:16,593
Christ, I'm more broke now than
when I started this fucking thing!

935
01:16:16,770 --> 01:16:20,069
I wish I'd never met you.
Any of you!

936
01:16:21,542 --> 01:16:24,739
Jesus, I think I'm gonna be sick.

937
01:16:34,388 --> 01:16:36,447
I'm sorry.

938
01:16:37,491 --> 01:16:40,824
I got a kid, for chrissake.
What am I gonna do?

939
01:16:40,995 --> 01:16:45,762
Sweet Jesus.
Hey, guys, take a look at this.

940
01:16:45,933 --> 01:16:49,130
It's a cookie-jar stash.

941
01:16:50,271 --> 01:16:54,833
There must be 1000 bucks here.
Not a bad consolation prize, huh?

942
01:16:55,009 --> 01:16:57,102
Let me see that.

943
01:17:11,258 --> 01:17:13,123
It's delicious.

944
01:17:13,294 --> 01:17:16,627
The girl must have made it
before they fired her.

945
01:17:16,797 --> 01:17:22,360
I'm gonna heat this up.
At least we'll eat good before we go.

946
01:17:31,178 --> 01:17:33,942
The pilot light must be out.

947
01:17:35,115 --> 01:17:37,140
Got a match?

948
01:17:40,020 --> 01:17:43,046
Wait a minute. Does anybody smell...?

949
01:17:52,533 --> 01:17:57,266
I think it's probably a good idea
if we don't see each other anymore.

950
01:18:06,347 --> 01:18:08,042
Wait a second.

951
01:18:11,318 --> 01:18:14,253
I gotta give you your cut of the take.

952
01:18:35,309 --> 01:18:38,403
It's for your wife. Get her home.

953
01:18:47,221 --> 01:18:48,711
Thanks.

954
01:18:58,799 --> 01:19:00,994
What are you gonna do?

955
01:19:02,069 --> 01:19:04,629
It just wasn't our night.

956
01:19:06,240 --> 01:19:09,971
I better get home
and apologize to my sister.

957
01:19:14,214 --> 01:19:16,205
Be well, old man.

958
01:19:19,386 --> 01:19:21,946
If you get any more Bellinis...

959
01:19:23,457 --> 01:19:25,516
...just give me a call.

960
01:19:37,938 --> 01:19:39,838
So...

961
01:19:40,607 --> 01:19:43,098
...where are you going?

962
01:19:48,482 --> 01:19:50,040
I don't know.

963
01:19:50,217 --> 01:19:54,813
Get cleaned up,
and maybe I'll go see Carmela.

964
01:19:56,123 --> 01:19:58,614
That's a good idea.

965
01:19:59,660 --> 01:20:02,527
She's a nice girl.

966
01:20:02,963 --> 01:20:04,430
Yeah.

967
01:20:10,537 --> 01:20:12,528
I'll see...

968
01:20:13,974 --> 01:20:17,671
Hey, this safe...

969
01:20:17,911 --> 01:20:22,177
...this job, it's nothing.

970
01:20:22,349 --> 01:20:24,510
It's just money.

971
01:20:25,486 --> 01:20:28,887
Money comes, money goes.

972
01:20:30,457 --> 01:20:33,187
I'm an old man, I know.

973
01:20:34,495 --> 01:20:37,157
But to have someone...

974
01:20:39,166 --> 01:20:41,862
...somebody to walk with...

975
01:20:42,770 --> 01:20:44,931
...at your side...

976
01:20:46,406 --> 01:20:48,431
...is everything.

977
01:20:50,444 --> 01:20:52,810
She's a nice girl.

978
01:20:53,781 --> 01:20:56,944
Yeah. Yeah, she is.

979
01:26:01,154 --> 01:26:02,143
