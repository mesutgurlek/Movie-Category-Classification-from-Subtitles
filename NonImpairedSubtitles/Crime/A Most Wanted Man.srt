168
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:35,084
The man is the wall.

169
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:36,481
Oh.

170
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:40,611
The apartment belongs to a Leyla Oktay.

171
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:43,326
Turkish national, German resident.

172
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:45,486
A widow.

173
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:47,640
- One son, Melik.

174
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,365
Oh, Michael.

175
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:52,330
They have a citizenship
application pending.

176
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:54,126
Michael.

177
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:55,560
<i>MICHAEL: You've upset Dieter Mohr.</i>

178
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:56,841
Really?

179
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:58,520
It probably has something to do

180
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:01,331
with the terrorists you're allowing to
walk the streets of Hamburg.

181
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:04,042
<i>GUNTHER: We're on a wait and see approach.</i>

182
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:05,246
And what are we seeing?

183
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:07,280
Enough to keep waiting.

184
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:09,562
Don't underestimate Mohr.

185
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:12,089
He's got a lot of friends here in Berlin.

186
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:14,682
<i>Why don't you give him the Chechen?</i>

187
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:17,923
<i>Let him shine while you
stay focused on Abdullah.</i>

188
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:21,443
GUNTHER: I think he's moving the money to
a shipping company.

189
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:22,521
<i>Are you sure?</i>

190
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:24,569
Not yet, but close.

191
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:27,010
I need more time.

192
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:30,243
<i>I'll do what I can, Günther,
but watch your back.</i>

193
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:32,682
Word is the Americans
are taking an interest.

194
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,889
- Thanks for the warning.
- (HANGS UP)

195
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:41,087
(SARCASTICALLY) Whoo-hoo! Whoo!

196
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:43,051
Americans.

197
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:54,730
Günther Bachmann?

198
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:58,805
Martha Sullivan. US Embassy, Berlin.

199
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:02,611
I know you by reputation, of course.

200
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:04,484
That can't be good.

201
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:08,727
Men with good reputations
usually aren't much use to me.

202
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,604
What about women?

203
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:14,209
This is my colleague lrna Frey.

204
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:15,641
- Hello.
- Hello.

205
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:18,041
She sails and spies.

206
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:21,165
I don't sail.

207
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:24,801
Hamburg's a long way from Berlin.

208
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:25,961
What are you doing here?

209
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:28,088
Me? I am just an observer.

210
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,526
I have been observed by Americans before.

211
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:33,728
It usually doesn't end well.

212
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:36,080
From what I'm hearing, we're not the ones

213
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:39,289
you need to be worrying about.

214
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:42,930
OTTO: Good morning, everyone.

215
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:45,760
<i>Herr</i> Mohr has compiled a report.

216
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:48,568
Our investigations confirm

217
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:50,210
that lssa Karpov

218
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:54,763
is a member of a militant Salafi group
of Chechen jihadists.

219
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:58,207
Karpov was arrested soon after the capture

220
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:00,601
of the group's leader earlier this year.

221
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:03,406
Where did this information come from?

222
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:07,681
We have excellent resources
inside the Russian state security system.

223
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:12,321
After 24 hours of questioning,
Karpov confessed

224
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:16,047
to taking part in attacks on gas pipelines,

225
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:19,203
transport, infrastructure, police stations.

226
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:21,482
After 24 hours of Russian questioning

227
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:24,006
any one of us would admit to anything.

228
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:25,445
Are you contesting this report?

229
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:26,891
No. Yes.

230
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:29,166
Maybe.

231
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:32,364
We've not yet had the
benefit of reading it.

232
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:36,566
(SIGHS) The report concludes that
the terrorist Karpov has come to Hamburg

233
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:42,329
seeking to make contact
with lslamist cells operating in the city.

234
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:43,926
They hide among us.

235
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,570
- Really?
- OTTO: Yes.

236
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:46,920
Karpov is a wanted man.

237
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,367
If you have knowledge of his whereabouts,

238
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:53,570
you are obliged to follow
due process under the constitution.

239
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:55,165
You mean arresting him?

240
00:20:56,800 --> 00:21:01,203
Issa Karpov is indeed seeking
to make contact in Hamburg,

241
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:03,321
with a banker.

242
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:05,084
We've had no briefing on this.

243
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:07,400
Well, if you were doing your job,
you wouldn't need one.

244
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:08,680
We're not policemen.

245
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:11,724
We're spies.
Issa Karpov may be of value to us.

246
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:14,167
All I'm asking for is more time.

247
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:17,888
Our unit was set up to develop
intelligence resources

248
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:20,440
inside Germany's Islamic community.

249
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:23,284
- That's why we're here.
- Oh.

250
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:27,488
And I thought you were here
because you fucked up in Beirut

251
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:29,528
and your friend Michael
Axelrod had no idea...

252
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:32,211
This banker, do we know
what Karpov wants from him?

253
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:34,806
Not yet and if we move against him now,

254
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:36,564
the chances are we never will.

255
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:41,126
I think he knows what he's doing, Otto.

256
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:43,202
Maybe you should let him get on with it.

257
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:50,044
You have 72 hours to bring

258
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:51,525
this matter to a resolution,

259
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:55,730
if not, we will,
with or without your co-operation.

260
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:58,050
- OKay?
- OKay.

261
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:08,486

263
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:12,206
Okay.

264
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:18,848
Uh, I'll catch up with you later.

265
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:20,922
Okay, we'll see you there.

00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:23,921
Melik?

267
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:28,364
Did we have an appointment?

- Mmm, please?
- Okay.

Are you seeking asylum in Germany?

00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:34,005
I make coffee.

285
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:40,962
There has to be a reason.

286
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:43,402
Either you cannot return
to your country of origin

287
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:44,766
because your life would be in danger

288
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:46,171
or you have been tortured.

289

Yes.

Yes, what?

00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:51,889
I have been tortured.

Forgive me, but this is my job.

293

I want to believe you,
but people make this claim all the time.

It's only a matter of time before the
German authorities will find you.

299

It's better for your case

00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:32,125
Karpov died two years ago.
