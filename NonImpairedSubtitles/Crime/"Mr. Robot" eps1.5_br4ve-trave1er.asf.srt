ELLIOT: Evil Corp, Angela,
Vera, his brother,

321
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:34,165
Darlene, Shayla,

322
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:35,930
this is too much.
But I feel passionate about it, Elliot.

323
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,684
I should just tell her
what she wants to hear.

324
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:40,370
Angela,

325
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:42,201
trust yourself.

326

You'll do what's right.

How's Shayla,
by the way?

330
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:01,681
She's, uh...

331

You know...

332

Tell her I Say, "Hi."

333

You have no time to pull off whatever
it is you think you're doing.

These guys aren't playing around,
they will fucking kill you.

337
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:29,960
Now, wise up and let's go.

338
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:31,849
Darlene's in there.
We can't leave.

340
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:37,568
Okay. Then we
call the cops.

341
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:38,801
I mean there's no
other choice here.

342
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:40,245
It's the only way
out of this.

343
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:42,608
I can't call the cops.
Shayla will die.

344
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:45,331
Oh, come on, she knew exactly what
she was getting herself into.

345
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:47,926
You think his employees have
a long life expectancy?

346
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:50,651
She was dead the minute she
started working with that maniac.

347
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:52,449
Forget it, it's not happening.

348
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:56,563
This is a zero-sum game.
Calculate all the outcomes.

349
00:24:57,240 --> 00:24:59,004
If you don't pull off
this ridiculous miracle,

350
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:01,321
and odds are you won't,
you die and so does Shayla

351
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:02,731
That much we know.

352
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:04,802
But assume for a second
that you do pull this off,

353
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:06,325
bust Vera out of prison.

354
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:08,761
Who's to say he doesn't
kill you, Shayla, Darlene?

355
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:11,002
It would be in his own
best interest to do that.

356
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:13,367
Either way, you
all end up dead.

357
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:15,442
It's the only way Vera wins.

358
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:16,931
Zero-sum, Elliot.

359
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:18,730
You're playing a game
you already lost.

360
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:20,245
You know I'm right.

361
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:22,448
No, there's gotta be a way.

362
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:24,765
I can think of a way.

363
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:30,489
I get it, kiddo. You want to
help people, watch over 'em_

364
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:35,450
Best thing you can do for Shayla,
allow her to become a memory.

365
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:38,041
No.

366
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:42,891
True courage is about being
honest with yourself,

367
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:46,124
especially when
it's difficult.

368
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:50,206
There's no plan where both
you and Shayla survive.

369
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:55,244
I can think of a way.

370
00:25:55,640 --> 00:25:59,247
This new world that we are so
close to creating will never be.

371
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:03,646
And that new world, that is
success, f society is success.

372
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:05,485
Look at what you accomplished
at Steel Mountain.

373
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:06,800
That got us nowhere.

374
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:09,884
You took them down.
You won that battle.

375
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:12,324
This... This is failure.

376

The one who turns to morphine,

377
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:19,370
to drugs when he feels weak.

378
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:21,921
A coward, who can't
face the truth,

379
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,082
even though it's staring
him right in the face.

got no Drake, no Pitbull,

I'm ready to bust Vera out.

391

I can get into the network.

392
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:03,608
We need to go
to the jail, now.

393
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:07,325
She stays here.

394

No, I'm not leaving you.

to be giving out orders.

would set in and we had a solution?

398
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:23,605
To be honest, I miss that.

Elliot, what are you doing?

excessive voltage, my mind is frayed,

00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:46,570

my cell phone's running

an undetectable,

Wherever you go, you're gonna
need funding to keep surviving.

still needs to be making you money.

He had everything, your crew,

I took it all. I own
your whole world.

I need your word,
when this goes down,

see one of your guys following me,

477
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:54,040
Hey, man. Where you goin'?
Don't be stupid.

478
00:32:54,120 --> 00:32:55,690
All good, all good. We're
just gonna have a talk.

479
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:57,250
Elliot, are you...

480
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,002
Why are you doing this?
I can free your brother.

481
00:33:13,080 --> 00:33:14,161
I figured it out.

482
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:16,004
It just wasn't
your day, bruh_

483
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:18,686
I hacked your whole operation.
If you kill me, you...

484
00:33:18,760 --> 00:33:21,570
You don't get it. Like I said,
it just wasn't your day.

485
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:27,046
Stop.

486
00:33:34,120 --> 00:33:37,044
ELLIOT: I suppose a bullet through the
brain is peaceful in its own right.

487
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:46,648
You don't want
me to free Vera.

488
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:51,807
That's why you don't care
about the operation.

489
00:33:52,040 --> 00:33:53,804
I'd pick better
last words.

490
00:33:54,280 --> 00:33:55,441
You're trying to kill him.

491
00:33:55,520 --> 00:33:57,409
That's why Vera wants
to leave tonight.

492
00:33:58,840 --> 00:34:00,968
That's what's been
bugging me about you.

493
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:03,124
You never wanted me
to break him out.

494
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:05,888
Your best option for survival
is to kill him in prison,

495
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:07,803
because if you don't,
you're dead.

496
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:11,564
You're the reason Vera's
locked up right now,

497
00:34:11,640 --> 00:34:13,404
and he knows it.

498
00:34:14,160 --> 00:34:15,650
Doesn't matter anyway.

499
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:19,806
Vera was just gloating about how
he got in with the right crew,

500
00:34:19,880 --> 00:34:21,962
how he got the
jump on some men.

501
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:25,766
Uh, he's not worried, man,
he's protected now.

502
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:27,285
Bullshit.

503
00:34:27,640 --> 00:34:29,768
That leaves you with
a zero-sum game.

504
00:34:29,880 --> 00:34:32,724
If you don't get him out of jail,
he'll have you killed for failing.

505
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:36,367
Only way this works in your favor
is for you to kill him first.

506
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:39,448
And you can't do that
with him inside anymore.

507
00:34:39,560 --> 00:34:42,689
Shut up, motherfucker.
Shut the fuck up!

508
00:34:44,200 --> 00:34:46,680
Let me free him.

509
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:50,161
When I break Vera
out tonight,

510
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:52,607
you do with your
brother what you want.

511
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:54,610
That's the only outcome

512
00:34:54,680 --> 00:34:56,842
where you got the
possibility of living.

513
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:01,206
It's your best move.

514
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:05,364
What makes you think I still
won't kill you afterwards?

515
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:11,131

Now I need to force feed it
into the jail's network.
