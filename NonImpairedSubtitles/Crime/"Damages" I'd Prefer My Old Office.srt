I clear it out?</i>

<i>(laughing)</i>

101
00:04:48,066 --> 00:04:51,026
<i>HEWES: What? I thought you told
me he was your only witness.</i>

102
00:04:51,186 --> 00:04:52,089
<i>PARSONS: He is.</i>

103
00:04:52,174 --> 00:04:54,946
<i>I think the company
pressured him to redeploy.</i>

104
00:04:56,318 --> 00:04:59,132
<i>HEWES: Your entire case
hinges on his testimony.</i>

<i>What are you going to do?</i>

106
00:05:04,090 --> 00:05:05,474
<i>PARSONS: I figure I have
one of two choices.</i>

107
00:05:05,566 --> 00:05:08,837
<i>I could either sit around and
wait for Chris to come back, or</i>

108
00:05:08,924 --> 00:05:11,115
<i>I could take my chances
and file my case.</i>

109
00:05:11,524 --> 00:05:13,511
<i>And hopefully, something
will come up in discovery.</i>

110
00:05:13,593 --> 00:05:16,044
<i>HEWES: If the judge lets
you get to discovery.</i>

111
00:05:16,941 --> 00:05:19,615
You'll be lucky if he doesn't
dismiss the case outright.

112
00:05:19,747 --> 00:05:24,214
PARSONS: What would you do?
I'm asking your advice.

113
00:05:28,027 --> 00:05:31,962
I know, I know. It's my case.
I just thought I'd ask.

114
00:05:32,902 --> 00:05:34,348
HEWES: You know what I'd do.

115
00:05:36,169 --> 00:05:37,681
PARSONS: You'd file the case.

116
00:05:38,023 --> 00:05:40,194
HEWES: If in doubt,
throw the first punch.

123
00:06:11,935 --> 00:06:13,068
(helicopter whirrs in distance)

124
00:06:13,607 --> 00:06:14,538
(panting)

125
00:06:14,790 --> 00:06:16,332
SANCHEZ: Yeah.

126
00:06:26,687 --> 00:06:28,134
That shrink gave them to me.

127
00:06:30,915 --> 00:06:32,487
CARTER: Anything you
want to talk about?

128
00:06:34,352 --> 00:06:36,513
SANCHEZ: Before we left
on the last mission...

129
00:06:40,012 --> 00:06:41,508
Lowry came to me.

130
00:06:44,469 --> 00:06:49,644
He wanted to beg off.
Said it didn't feel right.

131
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:51,857
It was too last minute,
we weren't prepared.

132
00:06:57,008 --> 00:06:58,939
I told him everything
would be all right.

133
00:07:01,016 --> 00:07:03,640
CARTER: What happened with
those guys, Sancho-- It...

134
00:07:05,380 --> 00:07:07,615
It wasn't your fault just
'cause you didn't die with 'em.

135
00:07:12,021 --> 00:07:16,050
ERICKSON: There are people in this world
who see things differently than we do.

136
00:07:16,194 --> 00:07:20,741
They mean well. They really do.
But they have different beliefs.

137
00:07:21,354 --> 00:07:24,180
We can't change them.
We shouldn't try to.

138
00:07:24,291 --> 00:07:28,432
But they can't
change us, either.

139
00:07:29,180 --> 00:07:32,094
It's important to take
pride in our beliefs.

140
00:07:32,293 --> 00:07:36,088
They are what sustain
us and give us purpose.

141
00:07:37,179 --> 00:07:38,759
Never forget that.

00:08:05,292 --> 00:08:06,797
ERICKSON: Hear that, Jack?

152
00:08:07,036 --> 00:08:09,082
PROTESTORS: Murder for money!
Murder for money!

153
00:08:09,322 --> 00:08:13,000
ERICKSON: Think maybe you could find a
way to get these people off my street?

154
00:08:13,098 --> 00:08:15,848
SHAW: Well, I would, but there's a
little thing called the First Amendment.

155
00:08:15,945 --> 00:08:18,686
ERICKSON: What's going on?
I'm taking the boys to choir practice.

156
00:08:18,769 --> 00:08:22,337
SHAW: A wrongful death suit was filed
against you and High Star in federal court.

157
00:08:22,461 --> 00:08:23,516
ERICKSON: What's it say?

158
00:08:23,631 --> 00:08:27,013
SHAW: Three High Star
employees-- Jay Rayburn, Robert Franks

159
00:08:27,090 --> 00:08:31,670
and Thomas Lowry-- Were killed during
an unauthorized operation in Afghanistan.

160
00:08:33,709 --> 00:08:34,933
What do you know about it?

161
00:08:35,085 --> 00:08:36,806
ERICKSON: Meet me at
the house in two hours.

162
00:08:37,073 --> 00:08:40,110
PROTESTORS: Murder for money!
Murder for money!

163
00:08:40,925 --> 00:08:41,593
(door being kicked in)

164
00:08:48,395 --> 00:08:49,539
CARTER: Put some
plastic on these guys.

165
00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:50,618
SANCHEZ: All clear!

166
00:08:52,797 --> 00:08:56,012
Wait a minute. It's not him.

167
00:08:59,853 --> 00:09:01,222
SANCHEZ: Hey, hey,
hey, hey, hey!

168
00:09:03,448 --> 00:09:04,233
He's not here.

169
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:07,196
Hey! Boss asked you a question!

170
00:09:11,145 --> 00:09:11,731
SANCHEZ: What?

171
00:09:14,109 --> 00:09:15,280
I'm not catching all that.
What'd he say?

172
00:09:15,627 --> 00:09:18,423
CARTER: He's saying that they're afraid
of Nur Taraki. They hate the guy.

173
00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:22,822
Okay, let's bring them all in.

174
00:09:22,977 --> 00:09:23,697
SANCHEZ: A.C., no, no, no.

175
00:09:23,798 --> 00:09:25,543
Come on, man, look at these
guys-- They don't know shit.

176
00:09:25,660 --> 00:09:28,016
The intel was wrong. Let 'em go.

177
00:09:28,115 --> 00:09:29,540
Take off the fuckin' restraints.

178
00:09:30,408 --> 00:09:32,330
SHAW: The plaintiff's
attorney is Ellen Parsons.

179
00:09:32,739 --> 00:09:33,846
ERICKSON: Tell me about her.

180
00:09:34,022 --> 00:09:36,300
SHAW: Well, she was a hotshot
coming out of law school.

181
00:09:36,392 --> 00:09:38,648
Her first job was working
for Patty Hewes.

182
00:09:38,801 --> 00:09:40,733
ERICKSON: Patty who?
SHAW: Hewes.

183
00:09:41,019 --> 00:09:42,687
She took down Arthur Frobisher,

184
00:09:42,805 --> 00:09:44,552
handled that mess
with Louis Tobin.

185
00:09:44,645 --> 00:09:45,754
ERICKSON: Oh, yeah.

186
00:09:45,914 --> 00:09:48,555
SHAW: Ms. Parsons cut her teeth
on the Frobisher case, and

187
00:09:48,634 --> 00:09:51,092
then she left Hewes &
Associates, went to work in the

188
00:09:51,180 --> 00:09:53,624
D.A.'s office, but she
didn't stay there.

189
00:09:53,782 --> 00:09:55,248
Looks like she went
out on her own.

190
00:09:55,409 --> 00:09:56,698
ERICKSON: Should I
worry about her?

191
00:09:56,891 --> 00:09:58,641
SHAW: No. She's just a kid.

192
00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:01,456
A bleeding heart trying to
make a name for herself.

193
00:10:01,624 --> 00:10:03,176
But she doesn't have
much of a case.

194
00:10:03,342 --> 00:10:07,512
The brief lists a single
witness-- Christopher Sanchez.

195
00:10:08,260 --> 00:10:09,298
(protestors chanting outside)

196
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:10,339
Do you know him?

197
00:10:11,557 --> 00:10:12,929
ERICKSON: Yeah.

198
00:10:14,453 --> 00:10:16,162
SHAW: Is he a problem?
ERICKSON: No.

199
00:10:17,377 --> 00:10:20,174
And he's working for me
right now in Afghanistan.

200
00:10:20,933 --> 00:10:24,886
SHAW: Then don't give this thing
another thought. I'll get it dismissed.

201
00:10:25,611 --> 00:10:26,963
ERICKSON: I'm
counting on you, Jack.

202
00:10:28,609 --> 00:10:29,885
HEWES: What have you found?

203
00:10:30,327 --> 00:10:33,952
HUNTLEY: I spoke to, um...
Tanya Greenblatt.

204
00:10:34,082 --> 00:10:35,246
HEWES: I have no
idea who that is.

205
00:10:35,358 --> 00:10:38,148
HUNTLEY: She worked with Michael
at Jill Burnham's art gallery.

206
00:10:40,454 --> 00:10:42,424
HEWES: And what did
Tanya have to say?

207
00:10:43,193 --> 00:10:46,752
HUNTLEY: Well, she, uh, lent Michael
her car just before he disappeared.

208
00:10:48,097 --> 00:10:52,657
And I-I think she may be the last person
who saw him before he left the city.

209
00:10:53,331 --> 00:10:55,542
But she hasn't heard
from him since.

210
00:10:55,798 --> 00:10:57,379
HEWES: Did she know
where he was going?

211
00:10:58,754 --> 00:11:00,472
HUNTLEY: No. No.

212
00:11:01,243 --> 00:11:03,424
But I'm fairly certain
he went to Boston.

213
00:11:03,923 --> 00:11:05,022
HEWES: Why do you say that?

214
00:11:05,124 --> 00:11:07,565
HUNTLEY: Well, I went through
that list of, uh, Michael's

215
00:11:07,651 --> 00:11:10,588
friends you gave me, and most
of them are away at school and

216
00:11:10,735 --> 00:11:14,562
didn't really keep up with him,
so I tried the social networks.

217
00:11:14,981 --> 00:11:16,599
You're not online.

218
00:11:16,762 --> 00:11:20,253
I tried to "friend" you, but you don't...
you don't have a page.

219
00:11:20,610 --> 00:11:22,000
HEWES: No, I don't.

220
00:11:22,423 --> 00:11:24,154
HUNTLEY: You know, it's just
extraordinary, the whole

221
00:11:24,251 --> 00:11:25,560
paradigm shift in the
way people relate.

222
00:11:25,753 --> 00:11:29,661
I just... I really think you should...
should try it.

223
00:11:32,085 --> 00:11:33,917
HEWES: Did you find anything?

224
00:11:34,876 --> 00:11:37,533
HUNTLEY: Um, yeah. The...

225
00:11:38,043 --> 00:11:40,176
Have you ever met a Henry Thain?

226
00:11:40,614 --> 00:11:44,561
HEWES: Yeah, he and Michael were
best friends since they were 11.

227
00:11:44,842 --> 00:11:48,213
HUNTLEY: Well, a couple years
back, one of Henry's old

228
00:11:48,347 --> 00:11:51,362
Facebook postings read,

229
00:11:52,950 --> 00:11:57,748
"M.H. appeared out of nowhere.
Needed a place to stay."

230
00:11:59,032 --> 00:12:01,274
And that was right around
the time that Michael, uh,

231
00:12:01,385 --> 00:12:06,481
disappeared, and...
Henry was a freshman at B.U. at the time.

232
00:12:06,878 --> 00:12:10,203
HEWES: So, do you think there's a
chance that Michael is still in Boston?

233
00:12:10,443 --> 00:12:12,928
HUNTLEY: Well, I-I poked Henry
to find out, but he never

234
00:12:13,026 --> 00:12:16,907
responded, so I'd like to go to
Boston and talk to him face-to-face.

235
00:12:17,708 --> 00:12:18,989
HEWES: I'd like to go with you.

236
00:12:19,106 --> 00:12:20,658
HUNTLEY: Well, that's
not really necessary.

237
00:12:21,817 --> 00:12:23,700
HEWES: It's my son
we're talking about.

238
00:12:25,134 --> 00:12:26,847
(Catherine caughing
over baby monitor)

239
00:12:29,860 --> 00:12:31,780
Anyway, Catherine's sick.
She has a fever.

240
00:12:32,097 --> 00:12:33,786
HUNTLEY: They catch everything
at that age, don't they?

241
00:12:33,929 --> 00:12:37,866
HEWES: And besides, I don't
have a nanny and I... don't have

242
00:12:37,955 --> 00:12:42,468
anyone I trust that I can...
leave her with.

243
00:12:45,944 --> 00:12:46,915
HENRY: Dude, you're rich.

244
00:12:47,009 --> 00:12:48,872
Use your credit card,
get a hotel room.

245
00:12:48,963 --> 00:12:50,700
MICHAEL: I can't.
They can trace it.

246
00:12:50,785 --> 00:12:52,090
I don't want anybody to find me.

247
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:54,135
HENRY: What, are you
some kind of fucking spy?

248
00:12:54,222 --> 00:12:55,519
What the fuck are
you running from?

249
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:57,558
MICHAEL: No one.
Just... forget it!

250
00:12:57,712 --> 00:13:00,225
HENRY: Even if my roommates agree,
the R.A.'s this gay dude

251
00:13:00,299 --> 00:13:01,810
who's like the fucking Gestapo.

252
00:13:01,896 --> 00:13:03,737
I'm on a shit list for
partying in my room.

253
00:13:03,847 --> 00:13:04,713
MICHAEL: Fuck it.

254
00:13:06,777 --> 00:13:07,918
HENRY: What?

255
00:13:08,019 --> 00:13:09,250
What are you gonna do?

256
00:13:09,424 --> 00:13:10,389
MICHAEL: Do you really care?

257
00:13:10,555 --> 00:13:11,748
HENRY: Go back to New York.

258
00:13:18,139 --> 00:13:19,154
(horn honks)

259
00:13:20,670 --> 00:13:22,360
(traffic passing by)

260
00:13:24,803 --> 00:13:26,746
(vehicle approaching)

261
00:13:34,540 --> 00:13:36,292
CARTER: You wanted to see
that intel on Nur Taraki?

262
00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:41,063
(Sanchez sighs)

263
00:13:47,705 --> 00:13:48,758
SANCHEZ: Who compiled this?

264
00:13:48,919 --> 00:13:50,027
CARTER: Boorman sent it.

265
00:13:53,855 --> 00:13:55,366
SANCHEZ: There's a hundred
different sources here.

266
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:57,087
You know how long it would
take to check all these?

267
00:13:57,188 --> 00:13:58,373
CARTER: It's a fluid situation.

268
00:13:58,471 --> 00:14:00,511
I doubt the Mullah's in one
place for more than a day.

269
00:14:04,367 --> 00:14:06,302
SANCHEZ: I don't trust Boorman
with any of this shit.

270
00:14:07,109 --> 00:14:08,134
CARTER: Why would he lie?

271
00:14:08,731 --> 00:14:10,312
SANCHEZ: I got my own
contact on the ground.

272
00:14:10,481 --> 00:14:11,325
CARTER: Who?

273
00:14:11,490 --> 00:14:12,414
SANCHEZ: You don't know him.

274
00:14:12,497 --> 00:14:13,822
Someone I used to go
to for my own intel.

275
00:14:14,151 --> 00:14:15,220
CARTER: Good. Let's go.

276
00:14:16,205 --> 00:14:18,655
SANCHEZ: This is a
personal relationship, A.C.

277
00:14:19,962 --> 00:14:21,555
I need to go alone.

278
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:25,120
SHAW: Your Honor, Ms.
Parsons' entire case is based on

279
00:14:25,263 --> 00:14:28,542
a single witness, Christopher
Sanchez, who will

280
00:14:28,656 --> 00:14:31,464
supposedly testify
to an alleged event.

281
00:14:31,581 --> 00:14:33,789
There is no other evidence
supporting the plaintiffs' claim.

282
00:14:35,139 --> 00:14:37,095
PARSONS: When Mr.
Sanchez came forward as a witness,

283
00:14:37,182 --> 00:14:39,841
he claimed that High Star was
involved in illegal activity

284
00:14:39,932 --> 00:14:42,396
that directly led to the
deaths of three men.

285
00:14:42,589 --> 00:14:44,331
SHAW: Then why did he go
back to work for the company?

286
00:14:44,417 --> 00:14:46,430
PAWLOWSKI: Thank you, Mr. Shaw.
I'll ask the questions.

287
00:14:46,738 --> 00:14:49,743
SHAW: Your Honor, Mr.
Sanchez recently redeployed to Afghanistan.

288
00:14:49,893 --> 00:14:52,169
PARSONS: It's my belief that he
was coerced into redeploying.

289
00:14:52,279 --> 00:14:53,662
PAWLOWSKI: And that
belief is based on what?

290
00:14:53,772 --> 00:14:56,626
PARSONS: Mr. Sanchez has been suffering
from post-traumatic stress disorder.

291
00:14:56,747 --> 00:14:59,540
He was prescribed medication
by his doctor who was later

292
00:14:59,667 --> 00:15:01,324
killed under suspicious
circumstances.

293
00:15:01,420 --> 00:15:02,971
SHAW: "Suspicious"?
What are you implying?

294
00:15:03,077 --> 00:15:05,446
PARSONS: Mr. Sanchez believes
that High Star may have been

295
00:15:05,531 --> 00:15:07,241
responsible for his
doctor's death.

296
00:15:07,346 --> 00:15:09,961
SHAW: Keep it up, and I'll have a
slander suit filed against you by lunch.

297
00:15:10,088 --> 00:15:11,635
PARSONS: Given the
circumstances, it simply defies

298
00:15:11,746 --> 00:15:14,474
logic that Mr. Sanchez would
redeploy on his own volition.

299
00:15:14,562 --> 00:15:16,454
SHAW: I have his contract right
here, with his signature.

300
00:15:16,575 --> 00:15:18,603
PARSONS: All I'm asking, Your
Honor, is that you not dismiss

301
00:15:18,713 --> 00:15:22,122
this case until my witness has had the
opportunity to go on the record.

302
00:15:22,225 --> 00:15:24,892
PAWLOWSKI: How would you suggest
that we do that? He's in Afghanistan.

303
00:15:25,035 --> 00:15:26,376
PARSONS: He's working
for High Star.

304
00:15:26,492 --> 00:15:27,855
They must have access to him.

305
00:15:27,965 --> 00:15:30,155
SHAW: No, we don't. Mr.
Sanchez is out in the field

306
00:15:30,249 --> 00:15:32,601
on a six-month contract.
His assignment requires

307
00:15:32,697 --> 00:15:36,327
clandestine movement all over the country,
sometimes at a moment's notice.

308
00:15:38,637 --> 00:15:40,132
PAWLOWSKI: Ms. Parsons, you're
going to have to wait.

309
00:15:40,322 --> 00:15:42,622
Six months won't kill your case.

310
00:15:42,750 --> 00:15:44,517
PARSONS: But it could
kill my witness.

311
00:15:44,878 --> 00:15:48,245
He is in a war zone.
He could die at any time.

312
00:15:48,370 --> 00:15:50,417
For all I know, the company's
already had him killed.

313
00:15:50,508 --> 00:15:51,860
SHAW: Your Honor,
this is outrageous.

314
00:15:51,989 --> 00:15:53,385
PAWLOWSKI: Be careful, Ms.
Parsons.

315
00:15:53,501 --> 00:15:54,849
PARSONS: Can you prove
that he's alive?

316
00:15:54,937 --> 00:15:55,849
SHAW: Of course we can.

317
00:15:55,977 --> 00:15:57,372
PARSONS: Well, then you
must know where he is.

318
00:15:57,474 --> 00:15:58,746
Why can't the company
produce him?

319
00:16:02,135 --> 00:16:03,446
PAWLOWSKI: It's a good point, Mr.
Shaw.

320
00:16:05,282 --> 00:16:05,913
SHAW: Your Honor...

321
00:16:06,034 --> 00:16:07,467
PAWLOWSKI: Are you able
to produce him or not?

322
00:16:09,955 --> 00:16:11,161
SHAW: If necessary.

323
00:16:13,155 --> 00:16:15,165
PAWLOWSKI: I want to hear what Mr.
Sanchez has to say.

324
00:16:15,620 --> 00:16:18,366
I'll give you 48 hours to
produce him via video-link.

325
00:16:18,702 --> 00:16:20,547
SHAW: 48 hours?
I don't know that that's possible.

326
00:16:20,705 --> 00:16:22,401
PAWLOWSKI: I think
you can find a way.

327
00:16:24,126 --> 00:16:25,630
PARSONS: Thank you, Your Honor.

328
00:16:41,848 --> 00:16:44,649
ERICKSON: The judge is ordering
me to produce Sanchez in court.

329
00:16:44,807 --> 00:16:46,949
BOORMAN: Sounds like your
attorney's doing a bang-up

330
00:16:47,044 --> 00:16:48,717
job getting this
thing dismissed.

331
00:16:48,888 --> 00:16:52,565
Ellen Parsons is back working
out of Patty Hewes' firm.

332
00:16:52,713 --> 00:16:54,371
ERICKSON: How do you know?

333
00:16:54,682 --> 00:16:56,575
BOORMAN: I got her
cell phone tapped.

334
00:16:57,574 --> 00:16:59,575
ERICKSON: Ellen Parsons
filed the case alone.

335
00:16:59,808 --> 00:17:02,384
BOORMAN: Patty Hewes has got to
be putting her up as a front.

336
00:17:03,831 --> 00:17:06,048
ERICKSON: I don't
like this lawsuit.

337
00:17:07,976 --> 00:17:10,942
I think it may be time for
me to get my check book out.

338
00:17:11,043 --> 00:17:12,833
BOORMAN: You're already
paying Sanchez.

339
00:17:12,916 --> 00:17:14,526
ERICKSON: I'm not
talking Sanchez.

340
00:17:14,873 --> 00:17:16,866
I want to offer the
families a settlement.

341
00:17:17,219 --> 00:17:19,056
BOORMAN: Good idea, Howard.

342
00:17:19,212 --> 00:17:20,968
ERICKSON: I never liked
that last mission.

343
00:17:21,143 --> 00:17:23,518
The risk factor was
off the chart.

344
00:17:24,048 --> 00:17:26,797
BOORMAN: We had a small window
of opportunity. We had to go in.

345
00:17:28,414 --> 00:17:30,384
ERICKSON: The asset we
pulled out, was he worth it?

346
00:17:30,540 --> 00:17:34,650
BOORMAN: Absolutely.
We're getting quality intel out of him.

347
00:17:34,777 --> 00:17:36,027
ERICKSON: You still
have the guy?

348
00:17:37,807 --> 00:17:39,569
BOORMAN: He's
under our control.

349
00:17:40,831 --> 00:17:43,220
(classical music playing)

350
00:18:04,432 --> 00:18:05,975
BOORMAN: I got you
an egg sandwich.

351
00:18:06,102 --> 00:18:07,386
I think, uh...

352
00:18:08,433 --> 00:18:09,706
I think you're gonna like it.

353
00:18:12,509 --> 00:18:15,982
And you've been very cooperative,
so I threw in some dessert.

354
00:18:16,860 --> 00:18:18,093
(door squeaking)

355
00:18:18,685 --> 00:18:22,812
PARSONS: Howard Erickson called.
He wants to meet with me.

356
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,632
HEWES: Interesting.
PARSONS: Without his attorney.

357
00:18:27,461 --> 00:18:30,269
HEWES: That's unethical.
PARSONS: Highly unethical.

358
00:18:31,456 --> 00:18:34,658
HEWES: If the judge finds out,
you'll get thrown off the case.

359
00:18:34,898 --> 00:18:36,628
You and Erickson
can't meet alone.

360
00:18:37,536 --> 00:18:40,525
PARSONS: That's why I
want you to go for me.

361
00:18:42,828 --> 00:18:44,790
HEWES: Me?
PARSONS: You'd enjoy that, right?

362
00:18:44,906 --> 00:18:48,880
Sitting across from Howard Erickson.
Finding out what he's up to.

363
00:18:53,735 --> 00:18:57,315
PARSONS: Come on, Patty.
It'd be fun for you.

364
00:18:58,890 --> 00:19:01,044
And I would love to
get your take on him.

365
00:19:02,822 --> 00:19:04,655
HEWES: I'm sure you would.

366
00:19:14,252 --> 00:19:16,055
PARSONS: So, you're not
gonna do this for me?

367
00:19:17,538 --> 00:19:22,165
HEWES: No reason to.
PARSONS: I can think of one.

368
00:19:26,615 --> 00:19:28,234
ZAFAR MARWAT: Eat
some more, Chris.

369
00:19:28,935 --> 00:19:32,774
SANCHEZ: No. Really, I'm stuffed.
It was delicious.

370
00:19:34,695 --> 00:19:35,892
(speaking Pashto)

371
00:19:37,153 --> 00:19:38,290
ZAFAR: Good Pashto.

372
00:19:38,717 --> 00:19:40,409
(repeats what Sanchez just said)

373
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:45,868
We are very happy to have
you here, very happy.

374
00:19:46,807 --> 00:19:48,154
SANCHEZ: How are
things in the province?

375
00:19:50,319 --> 00:19:51,632
ZAFAR: Not very good.

376
00:19:52,321 --> 00:19:56,956
There is no safety,
little food, less hope.

377
00:19:58,456 --> 00:20:03,129
My only wish-- For my
grandchildren to know peace in

378
00:20:03,246 --> 00:20:07,603
their lifetime, but my son-- He
believes this is not possible.

379
00:20:07,772 --> 00:20:09,666
SANCHEZ: Where is Nasim?
I was hoping to see him.

380
00:20:10,585 --> 00:20:14,195
ZAFAR: My son is out
driving his taxi.

381
00:20:15,726 --> 00:20:16,899
SANCHEZ: Oh.
I'm sorry I missed him.

382
00:20:17,979 --> 00:20:20,212
I really need to ask
him some questions.

383
00:20:20,845 --> 00:20:22,493
ZAFAR: Perhaps I can help.

384
00:20:26,125 --> 00:20:28,161
ERICKSON: There's nothing
to be ashamed of, Jake.

385
00:20:29,024 --> 00:20:30,731
JAKE: I don't know what
you're talking about.

386
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,241
ERICKSON: The sheets.

387
00:20:33,451 --> 00:20:36,166
I want you to know
it's perfectly normal.

388
00:20:38,049 --> 00:20:39,855
You're 13 now.

389
00:20:40,830 --> 00:20:43,457
I think it's time you and I
had a talk about manhood.

390
00:20:44,300 --> 00:20:45,621
JAKE: Can I get the waffles?

391
00:20:46,251 --> 00:20:47,857
HEWES: Waffles sound delicious.

392
00:20:50,789 --> 00:20:52,546
HEWES: You don't know who I am?

393
00:20:53,323 --> 00:20:56,036
ERICKSON: Oh, shoot.
I'm so sorry.

394
00:20:56,149 --> 00:20:58,644
I feel like a certified ass.
Patty Hewes.

395
00:20:58,797 --> 00:20:59,825
HEWES: Hello.

396
00:21:00,210 --> 00:21:02,091
ERICKSON: Jake, I'd like a
word alone with Ms. Hewes.

397
00:21:02,176 --> 00:21:06,828
Could you give us a minute, son?
You got your Game Boy?

398
00:21:07,310 --> 00:21:09,616
JAKE: Sure.
HEWES: Thank you, Jake.

399
00:21:13,456 --> 00:21:16,818
I have a son.
ERICKSON: I have four.

400
00:21:17,535 --> 00:21:18,510
(both laugh)

401
00:21:19,490 --> 00:21:22,391
ERICKSON: I heard a rumor Ms.
Parsons wasn't trying this case alone.

402
00:21:22,603 --> 00:21:27,268
HEWES: Actually, she is.
She has no idea I'm here.

403
00:21:27,447 --> 00:21:29,332
ERICKSON: Then
why are you here?

404
00:21:30,174 --> 00:21:31,602
HEWES: I have my reasons.

405
00:21:33,838 --> 00:21:37,179
ERICKSON: Ms.
Parsons never got back to me.

406
00:21:38,778 --> 00:21:41,960
I was hoping I could find
a way forward with her.

407
00:21:42,999 --> 00:21:44,317
HEWES: A way forward?

408
00:21:44,656 --> 00:21:46,813
ERICKSON: Maybe you can
carry a message for me.

409
00:21:48,671 --> 00:21:51,022
I'm willing to make an offer.

410
00:21:59,761 --> 00:22:01,325
HEWES: That's a lot of money.

411
00:22:01,552 --> 00:22:03,896
ERICKSON: I just want to do
what's right for those families.

412
00:22:04,249 --> 00:22:05,723
HEWES: Ms.
Parsons won't let you.

413
00:22:07,999 --> 00:22:10,249
She's not interested
in a settlement.

414
00:22:10,754 --> 00:22:13,037
She's desperate to make
a name for herself.

415
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:17,014
But she's in over her head.

416
00:22:17,565 --> 00:22:21,181
If I were you...
I'd keep my money.

417
00:22:21,343 --> 00:22:24,070
She'll never beat you in court.
She doesn't have a case.

418
00:22:24,347 --> 00:22:28,868
ERICKSON: What is this, some
kind of negotiating ploy, or are

419
00:22:28,970 --> 00:22:33,188
you angling to push Ms. Parsons out so
you can take over this case yourself?

420
00:22:34,281 --> 00:22:36,525
HEWES: I have my own
cases to worry about.

421
00:22:36,657 --> 00:22:38,665
ERICKSON: Look, I'm not
interested in playing games.

422
00:22:43,794 --> 00:22:45,468
This is my final offer.

423
00:22:45,574 --> 00:22:49,105
HEWES: This isn't my case.
I'm in no position to make a deal.

424
00:22:49,205 --> 00:22:51,251
ERICKSON: Then do me a
solid and pass that along.

425
00:22:53,631 --> 00:23:00,069
The offer is generous. Tell Ms.
Parsons there won't be another.

426
00:23:04,290 --> 00:23:06,949
PARSONS: How did it go?
HEWES: It was smart to file the case.

427
00:23:07,059 --> 00:23:08,392
He wants to settle.

428
00:23:08,482 --> 00:23:12,529
He even was willing to negotiate
against himself and up the offer.

429
00:23:12,610 --> 00:23:13,774
PARSONS: But you
didn't accept it.

430
00:23:13,883 --> 00:23:16,445
HEWES: No, but you need to
take the offer to your clients.

431
00:23:17,359 --> 00:23:18,678
PARSONS: They don't
need to know.

432
00:23:18,820 --> 00:23:20,959
HEWES: That's not
exactly ethical, Ellen.

433
00:23:21,052 --> 00:23:22,481
It's a substantial figure.

434
00:23:22,620 --> 00:23:23,950
PARSONS: I'll think about it.

435
00:23:24,410 --> 00:23:26,335
HEWES: Well, anyway, you know that
Erickson's scared now,

436
00:23:26,411 --> 00:23:27,543
so just keep pusing.

437
00:23:27,737 --> 00:23:28,963
PARSONS: Thanks for
going to meet with him.

438
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:30,180
I'm glad we could
help each other out.

439
00:23:31,235 --> 00:23:32,771
HEWES: How's my little girl?

440
00:23:35,296 --> 00:23:36,831
PARSONS: She's fine.
Don't worry.

441
00:23:36,915 --> 00:23:38,366
HEWES: Well, check her
temperature every couple of

442
00:23:38,428 --> 00:23:40,893
hours, and if anything goes
wrong, anything at all, her

443
00:23:40,969 --> 00:23:43,794
doctor's number's on
the fridge, okay?

444
00:23:43,873 --> 00:23:45,673
And make sure she
stays hydrated.

445
00:23:45,793 --> 00:23:47,541
PARSONS: I'll take good care
of her while you're away.

446
00:23:48,769 --> 00:23:50,271
Listen, I forgot to ask.

447
00:23:50,353 --> 00:23:52,407
I'm looking after Chris's
dog while he's away.

448
00:23:52,483 --> 00:23:54,004
Is it okay if I bring her over?

449
00:23:54,161 --> 00:23:55,479
HEWES: Yeah, it's no problem.

450
00:23:55,566 --> 00:23:57,251
PARSONS: Okay. Thanks, Patty.

451
00:23:57,412 --> 00:23:58,116
HEWES: Bye.

452
00:24:00,903 --> 00:24:02,063
You drive.

453
00:24:03,739 --> 00:24:04,970
You do drive?

454
00:24:07,125 --> 00:24:08,351
ZAFAR: I know who he is.

455
00:24:09,156 --> 00:24:10,866
Mullah Nur Taraki.

456
00:24:11,248 --> 00:24:14,853
Well-known in this province.
Very powerful.

457
00:24:15,307 --> 00:24:16,969
SANCHEZ: I was told my men
killed his brother, and now

458
00:24:17,052 --> 00:24:18,201
he's seeking revenge.

459
00:24:19,210 --> 00:24:20,828
ZAFAR: Who told you this?

460
00:24:21,916 --> 00:24:23,804
SANCHEZ: It's better
for you not to know.

461
00:24:24,551 --> 00:24:28,675
ZAFAR: Taraki's brother was
killed, but not by your men.

462
00:24:30,150 --> 00:24:33,124
He was beheaded
by a rival tribe.

463
00:24:34,153 --> 00:24:35,414
Taraki knows this.

464
00:24:39,705 --> 00:24:40,969
SANCHEZ: Are you sure?

465
00:24:47,192 --> 00:24:48,582
ZAFAR: Listen to me, Chris.

466
00:24:49,157 --> 00:24:50,475
I am your friend.

467
00:24:51,235 --> 00:24:55,662
This story that you have
been told-- It's fiction.

468
00:24:56,752 --> 00:24:58,482
SANCHEZ: I thought it might be.

469
00:25:04,454 --> 00:25:06,887
But that's not the only
reason I came to see you.

470
00:25:09,345 --> 00:25:10,414
ZAFAR: No?

471
00:25:10,740 --> 00:25:12,819
SANCHEZ: I need to tell you
about the missions I led.

472
00:25:13,850 --> 00:25:17,481
Your son, Nasim, helped me with
information, what... whatever I

473
00:25:17,559 --> 00:25:18,740
needed to do my job.

474
00:25:18,832 --> 00:25:20,187
I will always be grateful.

475
00:25:21,823 --> 00:25:23,204
But what I did...

476
00:25:24,733 --> 00:25:26,612
We interrogated people.

477
00:25:28,336 --> 00:25:30,926
I think many of
them were innocent.

478
00:25:33,638 --> 00:25:35,160
Some of them died.

479
00:25:40,019 --> 00:25:40,973
I...

480
00:25:42,919 --> 00:25:45,959
I didn't think of it as
torture at the time.

481
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:48,364
We-we were doing it for
the right reasons.

482
00:25:48,450 --> 00:25:49,631
We were.

483
00:25:52,662 --> 00:25:56,223
But... I think we did
more harm than good.

484
00:25:58,232 --> 00:25:59,578
I regret it now.

485
00:26:01,621 --> 00:26:04,686
You came all the way to
Afghanistan to tell us this?

486
00:26:08,017 --> 00:26:09,326
SANCHEZ: I'm very sorry.

487
00:26:16,966 --> 00:26:18,215
(sighs)

488
00:26:18,938 --> 00:26:20,650
BOORMAN: I'm coming
up to get you.

489
00:26:24,410 --> 00:26:25,713
Time to pray.

490
00:26:28,403 --> 00:26:30,118
HUNTLEY: So you wouldn't
let Michael stay with you?

491
00:26:32,152 --> 00:26:34,018
HENRY: Look, I'm gonna
be late for class.

492
00:26:34,849 --> 00:26:37,145
HUNTLEY: You're not going to turn
your back on him again, are you?

493
00:26:37,436 --> 00:26:39,999
HENRY: What was I supposed to
do, let him live in my dorm?

494
00:26:40,142 --> 00:26:41,388
I had roommates.

495
00:26:41,567 --> 00:26:43,083
HEWES: All right, Maggie.
That's fine.

496
00:26:43,643 --> 00:26:44,907
HENRY: Who is that?

497
00:26:45,285 --> 00:26:48,159
HEWES: And tell Girotto I need to
push back the deposition again.

498
00:26:48,264 --> 00:26:49,222
I'm out of town.

499
00:26:49,338 --> 00:26:50,402
HENRY: Oh, fuck.

500
00:26:52,294 --> 00:26:53,977
HEWES: Hello, Henry.
How are you?

501
00:26:54,083 --> 00:26:55,230
HENRY: I'm fine, Ms. Hewes.

502
00:26:55,322 --> 00:26:58,231
HEWES: So, you're a junior now.

503
00:27:00,026 --> 00:27:01,658
Your parents must be proud.

504
00:27:01,754 --> 00:27:03,822
HENRY: I'm so sorry about
Michael, Ms. Hewes.

505
00:27:03,935 --> 00:27:06,348
When he showed up,
we were in finals.

506
00:27:06,475 --> 00:27:07,901
I was totally swamped.

507
00:27:07,979 --> 00:27:09,432
I really wanted to
help him, but...

508
00:27:09,526 --> 00:27:10,808
HEWES: Relax, Henry.

509
00:27:10,875 --> 00:27:12,640
This isn't about you.
You are not in trouble.

510
00:27:12,719 --> 00:27:14,341
I'm just trying to find Michael.

511
00:27:14,425 --> 00:27:15,650
HUNTLEY: Any idea
where he is now?

512
00:27:15,789 --> 00:27:17,667
HENRY: Last time I saw
him was a while ago.

513
00:27:17,806 --> 00:27:19,569
HUNTLEY: And where
exactly was that?

514
00:27:20,604 --> 00:27:23,661
HENRY: He used to hang
out across the street

515
00:27:23,749 --> 00:27:25,921
from this nightclub
called Razor Fish.

516
00:27:26,065 --> 00:27:28,519
HEWES: Hang out? And do what?

517
00:27:29,689 --> 00:27:32,767
HENRY: Seemed like he was trying to
work his way into the scene down there.

518
00:27:33,823 --> 00:27:35,302
HEWES: Where did he live?

519
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:37,606
HENRY: In his car.

520
00:27:40,129 --> 00:27:41,987
HEWES: So he was homeless?

521
00:27:44,144 --> 00:27:45,388
HENRY: I brought him clothes.

522
00:27:46,022 --> 00:27:47,422
Even gave him money once.

523
00:27:49,172 --> 00:27:51,185
I'm so sorry, Ms. Hewes.

524
00:27:57,138 --> 00:27:59,588
BOORMAN: Patty Hewes came
instead of Ellen Parsons?

525
00:28:00,568 --> 00:28:03,156
ERICKSON: I don't know what kind
of tag-team they got going on.

526
00:28:04,801 --> 00:28:10,761
I offered 'em a shit pot full of money,
but they have no intention of settling.

527
00:28:13,363 --> 00:28:15,126
No. I'm not hungry.

528
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:23,097
I'm worried about Chris Sanchez.

529
00:28:24,641 --> 00:28:26,258
Who knows what he's
gonna say in court?

530
00:28:28,681 --> 00:28:31,103
BOORMAN: Hmm. He doesn't have to
say anything if he doesn't appear.

531
00:28:36,740 --> 00:28:38,376
Afghanistan's a
war zone, Howard.

532
00:28:40,709 --> 00:28:42,600
Anything can happen.

533
00:28:46,968 --> 00:28:48,828
(crickets chirping)

534
00:28:51,705 --> 00:28:52,990
CARTER: What did
your contact say?

535
00:28:53,083 --> 00:28:54,228
SANCHEZ: Boorman's
full of shit.

536
00:28:54,597 --> 00:28:56,093
We didn't kill Taraki's brother.

537
00:28:56,620 --> 00:29:00,583
The fucking fatwa against
me-- All bullshit.

538
00:29:07,776 --> 00:29:09,347
What are you doing, A.C.?

539
00:29:10,280 --> 00:29:14,404
CARTER: Sorry, man.
Lawsuit's been filed.

540
00:29:14,927 --> 00:29:16,265
There's going to be a hearing.

541
00:29:17,774 --> 00:29:19,442
The company cannot
have you talking.

542
00:29:23,412 --> 00:29:25,719
JUDGE PAWLOWSKI: Mr. Shaw,
we have been here for over an hour.

543
00:29:25,853 --> 00:29:26,713
SHAW: I'm sorry, Your Honor.

544
00:29:26,805 --> 00:29:28,983
They assured me Mr.
Sanchez would be online by now.

545
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:30,823
It may be a technical problem.

546
00:29:31,033 --> 00:29:32,341
Perhaps we could reschedule?

547
00:29:32,428 --> 00:29:33,747
PARSONS: They're just
stalling, Your Honor.

548
00:29:33,824 --> 00:29:35,475
Either that, or my witness
is being threatened.

549
00:29:35,570 --> 00:29:37,558
SANCHEZ: Can you hear me? Ellen?

550
00:29:38,947 --> 00:29:40,337
PAWLOWSKI: Welcome, Mr.
Sanchez.

551
00:29:40,999 --> 00:29:42,001
(crickets chirping)

552
00:29:43,044 --> 00:29:45,491
PARSONS: Mr. Sanchez, on the
day Rayburn, Franks and Lowry

553
00:29:45,569 --> 00:29:48,132
were killed, you were on a
mission for High Star Security,

554
00:29:48,207 --> 00:29:49,195
is that correct?

555
00:29:49,304 --> 00:29:50,191
SANCHEZ: Yes.

556
00:29:50,476 --> 00:29:52,680
PARSONS: And what was the
purpose of this operation?

557
00:29:52,818 --> 00:29:55,070
SANCHEZ: Our orders were to
escort kitchen equipment to a

558
00:29:55,147 --> 00:29:56,978
NATO base outside Kandahar.

559
00:29:59,134 --> 00:30:00,368
PARSONS: Kitchen equipment?

560
00:30:00,539 --> 00:30:01,653
SANCHEZ: That's correct.

561
00:30:03,384 --> 00:30:05,136
PARSONS: Mr. Sanchez, in
previous conversations, do you

562
00:30:05,219 --> 00:30:09,014
recall stating that you were
involved in an illegal operation?

563
00:30:10,770 --> 00:30:11,737
SANCHEZ: No.

564
00:30:14,181 --> 00:30:16,074
I don't ever recall saying that.

565
00:30:20,232 --> 00:30:22,079
We were escorting
kitchen supplies.

566
00:30:23,706 --> 00:30:25,350
PARSONS: Then how
did these men die?

567
00:30:26,052 --> 00:30:28,411
SANCHEZ: We were ambushed as we
drove through the Kydar Pass.

568
00:30:28,511 --> 00:30:30,214
The enemy had position
on the ridge.

569
00:30:32,034 --> 00:30:34,956
PARSONS: Mr. Sanchez, is
your testimony being coerced?

570
00:30:35,093 --> 00:30:35,730
SHAW: Your Honor...

571
00:30:35,821 --> 00:30:36,939
PAWLOWSKI: He-he...
he can answer.

572
00:30:37,032 --> 00:30:39,604
Mr. Sanchez, are you
under any duress?

573
00:30:39,763 --> 00:30:41,707
SANCHEZ: No, sir, not at all.

574
00:30:42,890 --> 00:30:45,787
PARSONS: In previous
conversations, you told me that

575
00:30:45,865 --> 00:30:48,026
you never wanted to
return to Afghanistan.

576
00:30:48,783 --> 00:30:50,560
What has made you
change your mind?

577
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:53,015
SANCHEZ: My mother's sick.

578
00:30:53,963 --> 00:30:56,662
I needed the money, so I
re-upped with High Star.

579
00:30:57,048 --> 00:31:01,038
PARSONS: You may be 7,000 miles away, Mr.
Sanchez, but you are still under oath.

580
00:31:01,721 --> 00:31:03,828
SANCHEZ: I understand.

581
00:31:05,838 --> 00:31:07,857
PARSONS: Do you know the
penalties for perjury?

582
00:31:09,558 --> 00:31:11,164
SANCHEZ: I'm telling the truth.

583
00:31:18,137 --> 00:31:20,138
PAWLOWSKI: Do you have
anything further, Ms. Parsons?

584
00:31:20,942 --> 00:31:22,246
PARSONS: No, Your Honor.

585
00:31:22,568 --> 00:31:26,575
SANCHEZ: Ellen? My dog is sick.

586
00:31:28,255 --> 00:31:30,188
PAWLOWSKI: What-what...?
What did he say?

587
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,228
PARSONS: I'm, uh...
I'm looking after his dog, Your Honor.

588
00:31:33,333 --> 00:31:36,387
SANCHEZ: Can you take her to the vet?
Please, Ellen.

589
00:31:36,525 --> 00:31:38,856
It's right around the
corner from my apartment.

590
00:31:39,365 --> 00:31:40,689
SHAW: Your Honor,
this is absurd.

591
00:31:40,770 --> 00:31:42,791
PAWLOWSKI: Mr. Sanchez, we're
on the taxpayers' dime here.

592
00:31:42,867 --> 00:31:44,198
SANCHEZ: Talk to the vet.

593
00:31:44,677 --> 00:31:46,790
The dog-- She was abused
by her previous owner.

594
00:31:46,875 --> 00:31:49,056
PAWLOWSKI: Mr. Sanchez, this-this...
this situation is over.

595
00:31:49,133 --> 00:31:51,614
Thank you very much for your
cooperation. Be safe, sir.

596
00:31:51,717 --> 00:31:52,732
(static hissing)

597
00:31:54,367 --> 00:31:55,336
Wow.

598
00:31:56,592 --> 00:31:59,493
At this point, Ms. Parsons,

599
00:31:59,594 --> 00:32:02,119
I don't know exactly
what you want me to do.

600
00:32:03,551 --> 00:32:05,214
I don't see any
grounds for a case.

601
00:32:10,581 --> 00:32:12,053
(crickets chirping)

602
00:32:21,831 --> 00:32:23,222
CARTER: You did
the right thing.

603
00:32:26,531 --> 00:32:27,976
SANCHEZ: Let him go now.

604
00:32:38,572 --> 00:32:39,694
CARTER: Take him home.

605
00:32:56,164 --> 00:32:57,475
CARTER: Sorry.

606
00:33:04,913 --> 00:33:06,627
MICHAEL: Can you help me out?

607
00:33:07,306 --> 00:33:08,297
SETH: I doubt it.

608
00:33:08,625 --> 00:33:10,709
Wait, wait. See this...
This is interesting.

609
00:33:10,914 --> 00:33:12,578
This guy wants a handout.

610
00:33:12,721 --> 00:33:13,529
MICHAEL: Fuck off.

611
00:33:13,827 --> 00:33:14,530
SETH: What happened?

612
00:33:14,637 --> 00:33:16,694
You run away from home 'cause
daddy doesn't love you?

613
00:33:16,792 --> 00:33:19,536
Stop feeling sorry
for yourself, bitch.

614
00:33:20,473 --> 00:33:21,576
WOMAN: Come on, let's go.

615
00:33:27,168 --> 00:33:28,655
(crowd chatter)

616
00:33:29,613 --> 00:33:31,217
(club music playing)

617
00:33:48,817 --> 00:33:50,052
MICHAEL: How much
shit do you have?

618
00:33:50,548 --> 00:33:52,531
Enough. It's 40 a tab.

619
00:33:52,646 --> 00:33:54,935
You got the cash?
MICHAEL: No.

620
00:33:55,405 --> 00:33:56,810
Get the fuck out of here, man.

621
00:33:57,845 --> 00:33:59,056
MICHAEL: I'll take all you got.

622
00:33:59,500 --> 00:34:01,675
What, you gonna rob me now?

623
00:34:01,759 --> 00:34:04,399
MICHAEL: No. I'm gonna pay you
for everything you've got.

624
00:34:04,965 --> 00:34:06,775
And I want your suit.

625
00:34:08,025 --> 00:34:09,161
You're gonna pay me with what?

626
00:34:10,786 --> 00:34:12,049
MICHAEL: My car.

627
00:34:14,874 --> 00:34:16,374
What am I supposed
to do with that?

628
00:34:16,729 --> 00:34:18,459
MICHAEL: There's a chop
shop around the corner.

629
00:34:18,566 --> 00:34:20,613
You're a smart guy.
Figure it out.

630
00:34:22,821 --> 00:34:25,457
You want the car or not?

631
00:34:43,436 --> 00:34:45,334
PARSONS: Hi. Uh, I signed in.

632
00:34:45,738 --> 00:34:47,143
I'm Ellen Parsons.

633
00:34:48,730 --> 00:34:49,955
TARA: What's wrong with her?

634
00:34:51,199 --> 00:34:52,373
I'm not sure, actually.

635
00:34:52,478 --> 00:34:55,013
I was just told to bring her in.
She's not mine.

636
00:34:55,120 --> 00:34:57,236
TARA: Yeah, I know.
She belongs to Chris.

637
00:35:00,828 --> 00:35:03,646
So, uh, you're Ellen.

638
00:35:06,222 --> 00:35:09,532
I saw your name on his phone
when you called last week.

639
00:35:09,630 --> 00:35:12,341
PARSONS: Oh, right.
So you're friends with Chris?

640
00:35:13,223 --> 00:35:15,070
TARA: I-I thought so.

641
00:35:15,895 --> 00:35:18,597
But then he dropped off the
face of the Earth and...

642
00:35:23,370 --> 00:35:24,761
Is he with you now?

643
00:35:25,921 --> 00:35:26,904
PARSONS: No.

644
00:35:27,393 --> 00:35:29,814
We just knew each other from
high school, and he asked me

645
00:35:29,887 --> 00:35:32,761
to watch Ghwarri
while he was away.

646
00:35:34,017 --> 00:35:35,244
TARA: Away where?

647
00:35:38,489 --> 00:35:40,039
PARSONS: Afghanistan.

648
00:35:41,269 --> 00:35:42,576
TARA: He went back?

649
00:35:44,028 --> 00:35:46,616
PARSONS: Look, um, I know
this is gonna sound very

650
00:35:46,701 --> 00:35:50,515
strange, but I think that he may
have sent me here to talk to you.

651
00:35:53,388 --> 00:35:55,640
Chris insisted that
I bring her here.

652
00:35:56,502 --> 00:35:59,483
He said that her previous
owner abused her.

653
00:35:59,603 --> 00:36:00,804
Do you know anything about that?

654
00:36:01,574 --> 00:36:04,483
TARA: All I know is, Chris
rescued her from some

655
00:36:04,579 --> 00:36:06,962
asshole he was going
after over there.

656
00:36:07,421 --> 00:36:09,583
PARSONS: What do you
mean he was going after?

657
00:36:10,532 --> 00:36:14,094
CONWAY: Um, I don't know.
He didn't really explain.

658
00:36:15,688 --> 00:36:18,898
PARSONS: I'm just asking because he
wasn't supposed to be going after anyone.

659
00:36:18,999 --> 00:36:20,638
He was just there to
provide security.

660
00:36:20,751 --> 00:36:22,028
CONWAY: I'm sorry I can't help.

661
00:36:22,114 --> 00:36:23,063
I guess if Chris had wanted you

662
00:36:23,121 --> 00:36:25,108
to know something, he would
have told you himself.

663
00:36:30,762 --> 00:36:33,184
(techno-pop playing)

664
00:36:42,791 --> 00:36:45,643
MICHAEL: Hey, I heard
you're looking to buy.

665
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:47,016
SETH: You heard wrong.

666
00:36:47,223 --> 00:36:49,699
MICHAEL: You look familiar.
Do I know you?

667
00:36:51,357 --> 00:36:54,107
SETH: I've never seen you
before, and I'm not interested.

668
00:36:54,771 --> 00:36:55,978
MICHAEL: My mistake.

669
00:37:09,233 --> 00:37:10,743
WOMAN: Come on, I want some.

670
00:37:11,094 --> 00:37:12,117
SETH: How much?

671
00:37:13,338 --> 00:37:14,429
MICHAEL: $80 a hit.

672
00:37:14,544 --> 00:37:15,872
SETH: I can get it for $40.

673
00:37:16,439 --> 00:37:17,525
MICHAEL: Not this shit.

674
00:37:18,304 --> 00:37:20,070
WOMAN: Don't be such
a cheap bastard.

675
00:37:24,788 --> 00:37:26,775
SETH: Fuck it. Give me 20 tabs.

676
00:37:27,514 --> 00:37:28,645
MICHAEL: You won't be sorry.

677
00:37:33,476 --> 00:37:34,941
WOMAN: You should
party with us.

678
00:38:03,099 --> 00:38:04,391
SETH: Where are you going?

679
00:38:10,402 --> 00:38:13,821
MICHAEL: This was fun,
but I got to go.

680
00:38:37,130 --> 00:38:38,432
BIG RAY: Hey, guys,
we're closed.

681
00:38:38,572 --> 00:38:40,527
And no, you can't
use the bathroom.

682
00:38:43,535 --> 00:38:44,937
HUNTLEY: Do I look
like I need to pee?

683
00:38:49,185 --> 00:38:50,487
Do you recognize him?

684
00:38:51,340 --> 00:38:53,426
BIG RAY: Holy shit. That dude?

685
00:38:54,650 --> 00:38:56,180
What the fuck ever
happened to him?

686
00:38:56,393 --> 00:38:57,789
HUNTLEY: That's what
we're trying to find out.

687
00:38:58,018 --> 00:38:59,716
BIG RAY: You a cop?
HUNTLEY: Sort of.

688
00:38:59,969 --> 00:39:01,266
So what can you
tell me about him?

689
00:39:02,148 --> 00:39:05,229
BIG RAY: He used to hang out across
the street. The kid was an asshole.

690
00:39:05,926 --> 00:39:07,239
HEWES: He's my son.

691
00:39:09,283 --> 00:39:10,966
BIG RAY: Oh, I'm sorry.

692
00:39:12,568 --> 00:39:15,014
I can see that now.
You look alike.

693
00:39:15,390 --> 00:39:16,729
HEWES: Why was he an asshole?

694
00:39:17,202 --> 00:39:18,882
BIG RAY: He started
slinging dope.

695
00:39:19,205 --> 00:39:22,810
HEWES: So...
He was selling drugs?

696
00:39:23,479 --> 00:39:24,544
BIG RAY: Yeah.

697
00:39:25,331 --> 00:39:27,230
HUNTLEY: Any of the people he
was running with still around?

698
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:29,089
BIG RAY: The dude
didn't run with anyone.

699
00:39:29,202 --> 00:39:32,432
He was a loner.
Pissed off a lot of people.

700
00:39:33,119 --> 00:39:34,735
The wrong people.

701
00:39:35,623 --> 00:39:37,138
Then one day he disappeared.

702
00:39:52,620 --> 00:39:53,933
HEWES: Thank you for driving.

703
00:39:56,450 --> 00:39:58,987
HUNTLEY: I've seen this kind of
thing before, and I-- I think

704
00:39:59,103 --> 00:40:03,360
you should be prepared
for, uh, anything.

705
00:40:08,592 --> 00:40:10,406
HEWES: You-you think
Michael's dead?

706
00:40:10,532 --> 00:40:13,253
HUNTLEY: No, I'm just saying
that you should be prepared.

707
00:40:28,775 --> 00:40:29,889
PARSONS: Hi.

708
00:40:30,018 --> 00:40:30,886
HEWES: Hi.

709
00:40:33,419 --> 00:40:34,565
PARSONS: Welcome back.

710
00:40:35,731 --> 00:40:36,739
HEWES: Thanks.

711
00:40:38,908 --> 00:40:40,433
PARSONS: Catherine's
doing a lot better.

712
00:40:40,546 --> 00:40:42,479
Her fever broke and her
temperature's down.

713
00:40:42,830 --> 00:40:43,874
HEWES: Oh, good.

714
00:40:44,790 --> 00:40:45,716
PARSONS: We had a lovely time.

715
00:40:45,809 --> 00:40:47,335
Read all her favorite
books twice.

716
00:40:49,884 --> 00:40:51,259
She's very sweet.

717
00:40:51,842 --> 00:40:53,053
HEWES: Yes, she is.

718
00:40:55,943 --> 00:40:56,864
(sighs)

719
00:40:59,115 --> 00:41:00,491
PARSONS: Did you find Michael?

720
00:41:03,429 --> 00:41:04,643
HEWES: No.

721
00:41:08,104 --> 00:41:09,617
PARSONS: I'm sorry.

722
00:41:12,399 --> 00:41:13,863
HEWES: So how's
your case going?

723
00:41:14,776 --> 00:41:17,103
What does your witness
say at the hearing?

724
00:41:18,285 --> 00:41:21,912
PARSONS: Well, um,
they got him to lie.

725
00:41:24,267 --> 00:41:26,385
He was trying to
tell me something.

726
00:41:26,514 --> 00:41:29,347
I think they were going after
somebody over there, but I

727
00:41:29,436 --> 00:41:31,347
haven't figured out
what he meant yet.

728
00:41:37,123 --> 00:41:39,176
I've been lying to myself.

729
00:41:40,967 --> 00:41:42,591
I'm stuck.

730
00:41:44,442 --> 00:41:47,132
I can't win this case
without you, Patty.

731
00:41:50,613 --> 00:41:53,045
I want more than just
the firm's resources.

732
00:41:58,149 --> 00:42:03,246
HEWES: You want the benefit of
my experience and advice, so

733
00:42:03,359 --> 00:42:06,809
you can make a name for yourself
and go out on your own.

734
00:42:07,936 --> 00:42:09,781
PARSONS: Why
wouldn't I want that?

735
00:42:12,086 --> 00:42:14,634
HEWES: All you
needed to do was ask.

736
00:42:17,195 --> 00:42:18,167
SANCHEZ: What the
fuck are you doing?

737
00:42:18,324 --> 00:42:21,253
I told them what you wanted!
I told them what you fucking wanted!

738
00:42:21,350 --> 00:42:22,732
- What you fucking wanted!
- We can't let you go back to the U.S. man.

739
00:42:22,813 --> 00:42:24,577
This is about national
security, and you know it.

740
00:42:26,428 --> 00:42:27,901
Back the fuck up.

741
00:42:30,886 --> 00:42:32,692
SANCHEZ: A.C.
Don't do this to me!

742
00:42:32,869 --> 00:42:34,122
(door locking)

743
00:42:34,658 --> 00:42:35,370
(panting)

744
00:42:36,313 --> 00:42:38,315
Fuck! Fuck!

745
00:42:50,671 --> 00:42:52,186
(crickets chirping)

746
00:42:52,949 --> 00:42:54,140
(vehicle approaching)

747
00:43:06,708 --> 00:43:08,022
HIGH STAR CONTRACTOR:
You're free to go.

748
00:43:34,942 --> 00:43:35,937
(car door closes)

749
00:43:45,726 --> 00:43:46,703
(gunshot)

750
00:43:50,285 --> 00:43:51,382
(gunshot)

751
00:44:04,827 --> 00:44:06,211
(car door closes)

752
00:44:13,273 --> 00:44:15,379
(classical music playing)

753
00:44:31,719 --> 00:44:32,642
MAN (over radio):
Thank God for Patty...

754
00:44:32,731 --> 00:44:34,137
(loud thud, tires squealing)

755
00:44:41,023 --> 00:44:43,525
MICHAEL: Getting away from you is the best
thing that could have happened to me.

756
00:44:49,143 --> 00:44:51,780
People either leave
you or they die.

757
00:45:43,491 --> 00:45:45,315
(unzipping duffel bag)

758
