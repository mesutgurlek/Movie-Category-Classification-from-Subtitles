1
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,440
You talk, we cut your face, hear?

2
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:01,520
Your purse. Put it in my hand, bitch.

3
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:03,800
I said put it in my hand!

4
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:12,480
You busted my mouth!

5
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:16,080
- Come on, he-man.
- I'll cut you, man.

6
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:18,720
I got the hots for ya.

7
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:22,480
Drop it. Drop it!

8
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:25,360
Drop it!

9
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:03,400
You got one more shot to drop it, man.

10
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:05,720
- I'll cut you, man.
- Come on, badass.

11
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:08,800
Come on. Cut me, badass.
Come on. Come for me.

12
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:14,200
Come on.

13
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:16,480
Come on! Come on, badass.

14
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:34,720
You got the right to a legal counsel.

15
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:37,560
You have the right to remain silent.

16
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:42,520
And anything you say can be
used in a court of law against you.

17
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:43,560
Amen.

18
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:09,000
Oh! Excuse me.

19
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:53,720
- Oh, it's warm in here.
- Isn't it, though?

20
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:57,960
- May I help you with anything?
- Yes, yes. Something special.

21
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:02,120
Oh, yes. I think you might be
interested in something like this.

22
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:04,520
That's good. What is it?

23
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:09,400
I think you'd be interested in this
more, sir. Would you like to smell it?

24
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:14,120
- What do you think?
- Would you wrap it up for me?

25
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:17,120
- I'll be back in a couple of minutes.
- All right.

26
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:20,200
You really are very pretty.

27
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:23,440
Well, thank you.

28
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:53,720
United Press.

29
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:58,280
I have an announcement to make
for your international wire.

30
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:03,000
The Wulfgar Command has just struck
a blow against British colonialism.

31
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:06,160
Be warned that I have a long arm...

32
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:10,480
...and I'm prepared to fight
my enemies wherever they may be.

33
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:12,560
Don't forget...

34
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:15,040
...there's no security.

35
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:17,600
Police!

36
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:20,880
- Put your hands up! Against the wall!
- Move! Move!

37
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:25,560
What the fuck is this shit?
How much shit you want, man?

38
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:27,480
How much for this motherfuckin' shit?

39
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,640
- Who you talkin' to?
- You, pig!

40
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:33,760
- Who the fuck you talkin' to?
- You, pig! How much money you want?

41
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:36,480
- Shut up, man.
- Shut up, my ass! How much...?

42
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:44,520
I want you to pay for every life you've
wasted on this shit, motherfucker!

43
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:46,440
- Motherfucker!
- Let him go, Matt.

44
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:50,680
That ain't worth it, man.

45
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:54,000
I said he ain't worth it.

46
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:56,600
Let him go, Matt.

47
00:09:57,640 --> 00:09:59,800
Matt, let him go.

48
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:06,600
If I ever see you again,
I'm gonna kill you.

49
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:09,920
Do you hear me? I'm gonna kill you.
Now you get over there.

50
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:11,920
Now move! Move!

51
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:16,840
Move!

52
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:24,840
All right, keep your hands up. Let's go.
We're all goin' downtown. Come on.

53
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:29,600
Come on, kid.

54
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:40,280
- I could use some coffee. You?
- Yeah, sure.

55
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:44,840
I went to a party last night.
I'm not used to this nightlife.

56
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:47,440
- How does that feel?
- Good. Both sides look OK.

57
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:53,480
- Let the lady out.
- I'll be cool.

58
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,440
Wait a minute. We got things to do now.

59
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:05,680
- Why do you have to see her now?
- Just cover me for ten minutes.

60
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:09,040
- I want to see her now, that's all.
- Excuse me, ma'am.

61
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:13,280
- I'll call on her. Don't worry.
- Don't hang around too long, OK?

62
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:15,520
- I'll be ten minutes.
- Well, hurry up.

63
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:18,600
Take your hat off, at least. Jesus Christ.

64
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,680
Please, let me help you out.

65
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:41,240
Irene, I think the pleat you added
to my summer-skirt design is fantastic.

66
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:45,520
Incidentally, there's an important
buyer coming by in a few days.

67
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:50,840
It might be a good career move for you
if you'd escort him to dinner and such.

68
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:56,720
Think it over.

69
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:09,800
Deke, what are you doing back here?

70
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:13,080
I came up the back way so I didn't
embarrass you in this get-up.

71
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:15,320
Very chic(!)
Why are you dressed like that?

72
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:17,400
Me and Fox just got back from the Bronx.

73
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:20,080
- Were you cruising?
- Nah, dope bust.

74
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:23,200
- You all right?
- Oh, yeah, fine.

75
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:27,360
- So how are you doin'?
- Great. Yeah.

76
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:32,560
- Being promoted next week, even.
- Is that right? That's good.

77
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:37,720
Why did you come by? I've gotta get back
to work. I've got a million things to do.

78
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:41,760
Well, I was wonderin'
if maybe later tonight...

79
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:44,560
...we could spend some time together?

80
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:56,360
What do you want from me, Deke?

81
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:59,720
- What do you want from me?
- What?

82
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:03,640
Look, maybe I made a few mistakes.
I admit that, all right?

83
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:07,520
Look, you wouldn't like living
with me again. You really wouldn't.

84
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:12,000
- Irene, I know what I like.
- Well, it isn't the right time, anyway.

85
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:14,560
This is not the right time.

86
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:15,720
People grow, Deke.

87
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:19,160
I don't understand why you can't
get transferred off the streets.

88
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:21,760
Why do you have to do
these insane kinda things?

89
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:24,720
Why the hell can't you change?

90
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:27,000
I did.

91
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:37,440
Can I come by tonight?

92
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:41,680
Can I?

93
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:47,080
Why didn't you ever pay this much
attention when I was with you?

94
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:51,800
Cos I didn't know what
it'd be like without you.

95
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:59,360
I have to get back to work.

96
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:02,280
I have to go.

97
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:06,360
I've really got a million things to do.

98
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:09,640
We'll talk later, all right?

99
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:37,800
Listen, I've always seen you hanging about
college, but no one knows what you do.

100
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:40,360
Does it matter? I'm in business.

101
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:55,000
Don't run away now.

102
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:57,480
I really am a remarkable fellow.

103
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:15,520
Kenna, you look a bit nervous.
Mercer sent my money?

104
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:19,440
Not this trip. They want to
talk to you about that bomb.

105
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:21,600
Mercer says it was overdone.

106
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:24,280
Several children were killed.
It hurt the movement.

107
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:28,160
Don't your people realize what it
costs to run an operation like this?

108
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:31,240
I work miracles for them.

109
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:35,000
Kenna... where were you since Friday?

110
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:41,120
They picked me up at the airport
and they held me over the weekend.

111
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:43,360
- The police?
- No worry at all.

112
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:50,440
- But you still came here.
- You know I'd never tell them anything.

113
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:07,400
You already have.

114
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:18,200
Move.

115
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,080
You go to a better life.

116
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:56,160
- Excuse me, Inspector.
- Where's that bastard Hartman?

117
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:58,880
He's over at the back of the crowd, sir.

118
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:04,160
- What's going on here?
- Can you tell us anything?

119
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:07,200
I don't want to hear a word from you,
Hartman, that you warned us.

120
00:17:07,320 --> 00:17:09,680
Not one word, understand?

121
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:21,800
One of these days it would be nice if
someone listened before it was too late.

122
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:26,040
First the bombing, then three men
come to get him, and he gets them.

123
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:28,680
He's becoming quite a legend here, sir.

124
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:31,960
Maybe. But even a legend can go too far.

125
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:34,800
He's now killed one of his own.

126
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:40,840
A man in his position has to worry as
much about his friends as his enemies.

127
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:51,800
Bless me, Father, for I have sinned.

128
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:54,520
You fool,
where the hell have you been?

129
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:58,080
Wulfgar, you must be out of your mind
to bring me here,

130
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:00,680
right next to police headquarters.

131
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:04,400
Couldn't you find another meeting place,
other than Sainte Chapelle?

132
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:06,120
I go where I like.

133
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:07,920
My payment... let me have it.

134
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:17,840
A ticket to Madrid?

135
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:20,480
50 pounds?

136
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:26,080
Is Mercer joking, or what?

137
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:28,200
Mercer sent me.

138
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:32,600
But the killing of his courier
will not be forgotten.

139
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:36,320
He wasn't one of my people. He brought
the police to my door, the idiot.

140
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:40,400
An idiot with your photo in his pocket.

141
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:41,920
Yes.

142
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:44,680
He had brought you your passport.

143
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:47,440
Interpol has your photo now,

144
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,200
and that was very stupid.

145
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:51,520
Have you spoken to Hammad?

146
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:55,080
He thinks you are a dead man soon.

147
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:57,320
He needs my help.

148
00:20:57,680 --> 00:21:00,360
He needs someone
who believes in his cause.

149
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:02,200
But where can you work?

150
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:05,480
You can't show your face anywhere.

151
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:10,160
We'll see.

152
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,120
It's going down.

153
00:21:56,960 --> 00:22:00,240
- DaSilva, they want you downtown.
- What?! You blew his cover!

154
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:03,240
- Hey, that ain't my problem, pal.
- It ain't your problem?!

155
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:05,240
What the fuck do you want here?

156
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:08,040
- Who do you think you're talkin' to?
- I'm talkin' to you!

157
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:11,240
Don't ever come around on
our detail again, understand?

158
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:14,120
- Don't go shittin' me.
- You wanna say somethin' to me?

159
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:16,840
You do that again,
I'll break your fuckin' face!

160
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:19,800
Fuckin' glory boys.
Nobody likes your crap.

161
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:21,880
None of ya. Neither one of ya.

162
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:25,680
They make anybody a sergeant now.
Kiss my ass, Fox!

163
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:28,160
I'm gonna kick your ass!

164
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:32,800
Wise-ass!

165
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:35,120
What you got?

166
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:38,560
You know we can't come back
here again, you know that?

167
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:40,680
- Bitch.
- All the time...

168
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:43,960
What is this?
Let's get back to headquarters.

169
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:47,160
Don't litter.

170
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:49,240
- You littered.
- So arrest me!

171
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:15,080
Our mutual contacts insisted
that I see you today.

172
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:17,920
Normally I do not operate on Sunday.

173
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:21,240
You must be quite important to them.

174
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:26,240
Make yourself comfortable, I will show you
photos which will help you choose.

175
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:28,720
Please have a seat.

176
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:41,600
This one would be perfect for your face.

177
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:44,120
Notice the contours,
strong and well-defined.

178
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:45,400
Not for me.

179
00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:48,720
With the nostril more open then.

180
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:50,560
Not for me.

181
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:52,480
What do you want?

182
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:56,560
A smaller nose
and do something with his jaw line.

183
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:57,800
Yes, of course.

184
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:00,440
And the eyes can be made blue
with lenses?

185
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:07,240
Yes, I think we can do that.

186
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:09,600
Good, but do it fast.

187
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:12,360
What do you want exactly?

188
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:16,080
I want to be beautiful.

189
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:25,960
- Lieutenant?
- Right here.

190
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:28,400
I just got these latest transfer orders...

191
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:31,800
Don't sing me no operas today.
I don't feel good and I'm rushed.

192
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:36,880
I'm not singin' any operas.
I'm talkin' about these transfer orders.

193
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,800
Look, come on, Munafo.

194
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:42,920
For nine years I've been workin' decoy.
Now I'm pulled and I'd like to know why.

195
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:47,200
Look, you don't know me well enough to
call me Munafo, but I know you, DaSilva.

196
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:50,200
The gung-ho Lone Ranger
of the street-crime unit, huh?

197
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:52,120
You can forget about that.

198
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:55,680
We've been asked to cooperate
with the Special Federal State Unit.

199
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:59,880
- You two are assigned to an ATAC group.
- Come on! Terrorism, hijack, hostages...

200
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,160
That's FBI stuff.
What do they want with us?

201
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:04,720
Your military records had
something to do with it.

202
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:07,440
How many times you been
hospitalized this year? Five?

203
00:25:07,560 --> 00:25:10,680
Consider this squad a vacation from decoy.

204
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:13,960
- I don't need a vacation from decoy.
- Oh, yes, you do.

205
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:16,640
They need someone
who knows the local rat holes.

206
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:19,800
- Anything goes down, you're the man.
- Where did this come from?

207
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:23,360
The commissioner. He got it from
Washington. Specialists from Europe...

208
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:27,040
...Interpol, will help organize it
in conjunction with Federal funding.

209
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:30,240
And this department will extend
every courtesy, understand?

210
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:32,320
- No, I don't...
- Get your hands off me!

211
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:36,160
Understand this, sucker! You're a cop
and you'll go where you're assigned!

212
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:40,280
Now you and Tonto be here tomorrow
at eight o'clock sharp! End of story!

213
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,480
Damn!

214
00:25:57,080 --> 00:26:00,960
High-gain antennae,
four mobile units, two on wheels...

215
00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:04,560
...plus one helicopter and
another moored at the battery.

216
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:09,160
Direct telex... to Interpol Paris
and all of Western Europe.

217
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:13,360
Computer banks which
give total information.

218
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:17,240
Retrieval on every known
terrorist in the world.

219
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:22,640
Some of you may wonder
why you have been selected.

220
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:28,520
Simply because of your unique qualities,
field record, courage, etc, etc.

221
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:33,280
You are to be indoctrinated
in counterterrorist techniques...

222
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:38,640
...which will enable you to meet your
terrorist adversary on equal terms.

223
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:41,160
Air France passenger
Andrew Dunham...

224
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:44,240
...please pick up a white courtesy phone...

225
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:50,160
Is this trip business or pleasure?

226
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:52,120
Pleasure, I hope.

227
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:54,400
Welcome to the United States.

228
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:59,080
The ATAC squad - that's the
Antiterrorist Action Command -

229
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:02,600
...has been formed due to a serious
lack of ruthlessness by the police.

230
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:06,240
- What are we doin' here?
- They've become bland.

231
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:09,320
First lesson: Threat equals fire power.

232
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:13,760
Terrorists, though relatively few
in number, rely on massive fire power.

233
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:17,200
Fragmentation grenades,
other improvised explosive devices.

234
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:20,800
Law-enforcement officials,
on the other hand, are poorly armed...

235
00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:24,160
...indoctrinated in the use
of non-deadly force...

236
00:27:24,280 --> 00:27:29,520
...and, to a great extent, are not
proficient in what weapons they do have.

237
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:42,200
Department policy, reluctance to fire,
police-public relations...

238
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:44,520
...human rights, civil rights...

239
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:48,160
...safety orientation, necessary
when dealing with civilians...

240
00:27:48,280 --> 00:27:50,640
...but catastrophic with terrorists.

241
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:54,520
- Pay attention, huh?
- The most important rule is...

242
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:57,640
...hesitation kills.

243
00:27:57,760 --> 00:28:00,120
Hesitation must be removed
from the policeman.

244
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:14,120
Are you sure that
this guy's even in the city?

245
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:20,120
The latest information, as gathered by
the Interpol computer bank, supports this.

246
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:23,480
He isn't comfortable in Europe.
No one will hire him.

247
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:26,880
Africa, Asia, the Middle East,
South America...

248
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,920
They've got enough revolutionaries.

249
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:33,720
But if you wanted worldwide press
coverage... New York. Where else?

250
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:39,120
What about the possibility that he
could have retired or gone into hiding?

251
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:41,600
Sergeant Fox, isn't it?

252
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:46,480
The answer to the possibility
of Wulfgar's retirement, sir, is...

253
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:47,960
...he's only beginning.

254
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:07,720
Go ahead.

255
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:13,440
In 72 hours, I want each of you to know
every detail of his past operations.

256
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:17,320
We must make use of
every bit of time we have.

257
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:20,200
I assure you Wulfgar isn't wasting his.

258
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:49,360
International terrorism, gentlemen,
is a worldwide organization...

259
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:53,960
...and the man who runs like a thread
through the majority of all of it is one...

260
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:56,400
...alias Wulfgar.

261
00:29:57,080 --> 00:29:59,880
There was a plastic surgeon
murdered in Paris recently.

262
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,920
The method and caliber of bullet used...

263
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:05,000
...was the same as Wulfgar has used
in similar assassinations.

264
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:08,440
So, gentlemen, he may now
look entirely different.

265
00:30:08,560 --> 00:30:11,200
The man truly enjoys killing.

266
00:30:11,320 --> 00:30:14,760
Don't start trouble, OK? Why are
you always such a troublemaker?

267
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:17,480
His pattern is that he makes
female contacts...

268
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:20,200
...to establish safe housing for his armory.

269
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:24,280
He also has a liking for fancy foods,
expensive clothes and the nightlife.

270
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:45,600
Let's not be strangers. I'm Eric.

271
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:47,840
The real name is Heymar Reinhardt.

272
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:50,240
Born Frankfurt, Germany, 1946...

273
00:31:50,360 --> 00:31:53,840
...educated Paris and
Patrice Lumumba University, Moscow.

274
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:58,800
Currently financed by... no one.
Since the London incidents...

275
00:31:58,920 --> 00:32:02,320
...he has become persona non grata
with revolutionary communities.

276
00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:05,400
What makes him dangerous
is that he wants to prove himself...

277
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:07,760
...as invincible as he ever was.

278
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:11,680
Well, not to us, of course, but
to international terrorist networks.

279
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:15,160
So he may strike anywhere,
without warning.

280
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:19,560
What he wants most is press coverage.
The media is their voice.

281
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:24,080
ABC... Television, right?

282
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:26,920
Right. And CBS is down there.

283
00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:29,600
Radio City is way on down there.

284
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:31,880
- The news is here.
- Mm-hm.

285
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:36,800
You know...
I never asked you what you do.

286
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:41,680
Well, besides dance a lot,
I fly for National.

287
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:44,440
"I'm Pam. Fly me."

288
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:48,320
That's an airline joke, sort of.

289
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:52,320
Don't get me wrong. I don't actually
fly the plane. I'm just a stewardess.

290
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:57,320
A flying waitress, some people call us,
but I'd rather dance than do any of that.

291
00:32:57,440 --> 00:32:59,600
- How about you?
- Me?

292
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:04,040
I'm an international terrorist,
wanted by half the countries in Europe.

293
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:06,600
- And I'm a lady-killer.
- Sure(!)

294
00:33:08,280 --> 00:33:11,240
If you allow him to
dictate the circumstances...

295
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:14,000
...the hostages will ultimately die.

296
00:33:14,120 --> 00:33:16,440
You can count on that.

297
00:33:16,560 --> 00:33:20,520
So, try to stay with me, everybody.
Time is short.

298
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:23,560
Very short.

299
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:27,880
- Something to add, DaSilva?
- We can't catch him if we sit in here.

300
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,840
It's a logical procedure.

301
00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:33,280
When you have been exposed
to counterterrorist techniques...

302
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:35,840
...then you will be ready for the streets.

303
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:39,080
A more logical procedure.

304
00:34:34,160 --> 00:34:36,400
He has no network, no real organization.

305
00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:41,000
He improvises. But he manages
to succeed where others have failed.

306
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:45,480
If he has changed his face,
he will be more dangerous than ever.

307
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:16,080
Jetzt!

308
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:53,400
And the destruction of several buildings
in your so-called financial centre...

309
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:55,480
...is only a warning.

310
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:59,960
Wulfgar will strike next
in the international community.

311
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:03,680
You people are never prepared.

312
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:06,160
And there's no security.

313
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:10,200
You may print that.

314
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:24,480
- You ever see anything like this?
- No.

315
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:29,560
This detonator tells me that
our suspect is not retired, Sergeant Fox.

316
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:34,200
Why now? Why not during the day,
when the place is wall-to-wall people?

317
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:37,040
- It's his method.
- What method?

318
00:36:37,160 --> 00:36:42,280
The instilling of fear. By tomorrow, the UN
delegates will be screaming for protection.

319
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:45,360
It's all part of the acts
of terror, gentlemen.

320
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:51,400
Shakka Holland.

321
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:54,080
OPEC raid, Vienna.

322
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:55,960
And?

323
00:36:57,400 --> 00:37:01,040
- And what?
- What did she do in the OPEC raid?

324
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:05,880
OK, once again.

325
00:37:06,440 --> 00:37:09,240
She shot a policeman in the neck
at point-blank range.

326
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:13,520
She kills without provocation.
She's a known associate of Wulfgar's.

327
00:37:13,640 --> 00:37:15,320
Uh, DaSilva...

328
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:19,680
...name the three successful
antiterrorist raids recorded worldwide.

329
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:21,720
We've gone over this for days now.

330
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:25,280
And we'll go over it
until it's second nature.

331
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:31,160
You have to learn to think like him, to
act with the same ruthlessness he does.

332
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:33,200
Isn't this overkill?

333
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:36,160
Overkill?

334
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:40,000
His cover's always some woman who's
clean. He loses one, he finds another.

335
00:37:40,120 --> 00:37:43,840
We know his MO, but what we don't know,
and we'll never know it sitting here...

336
00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:49,720
...is motive, method and opportunity.
- Forget this police-academy nonsense!

337
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:53,000
This is a terrorist.

338
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:56,880
He doesn't think like a criminal.
He wants to be a hero.

339
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,840
And you want to treat him
like some mugger on the streets?

340
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:03,840
- Get inside the man's head, dammit!
- Look, I understand that.

341
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:07,560
But how do you expect me to understand
you're training us to be assassins?

342
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:10,560
The only difference between
him and us will be the badge.

343
00:38:10,680 --> 00:38:14,240
I don't know about you, and I don't know
about the rest of these men, but...

344
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:18,640
...I didn't join the force to kill people.
- Oh, for Christ's sake, man!

345
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:21,880
To combat violence
you need greater violence.

346
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:25,400
To defeat a violent people,
you have to react in a given situation...

347
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:27,920
...with ruthless,
cold-blooded violence as well.

348
00:38:28,040 --> 00:38:33,720
And if any of you think that you don't
have the killer instinct, you're wrong.

349
00:38:33,840 --> 00:38:38,600
We all have it. It's just a question
of pushing the right button.

350
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:44,400
And if we're very lucky, there will be
one moment when he will be vulnerable.

351
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:48,040
One brief, critical moment.

352
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:51,680
- That is when you must do it.
- Do what?

353
00:38:52,280 --> 00:38:54,200
- Take him.
- You mean open fire?

354
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:57,880
There's no other way.

355
00:38:59,560 --> 00:39:02,120
And if we miss, that's dead hostages.

356
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:05,600
- Hopefully not.
- That's an unacceptable risk.

357
00:39:08,840 --> 00:39:12,440
There's a UN benefit at
the Metropolitan Museum next week.

358
00:39:12,840 --> 00:39:17,800
Those people are already hostages. It's
our responsibility to try and stop him.

359
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:21,040
It's not my responsibility to be
part of an accidental homicide.

360
00:39:21,160 --> 00:39:23,400
For Christ's sake, DaSilva!

361
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:26,720
Will you get out of this
cop-on-the-beat mentality!

362
00:39:26,840 --> 00:39:30,000
Your wife left you for it!
Wasn't that enough?

363
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:49,800
And how did I know that, DaSilva?

364
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:53,080
I make it my business to know
the backgrounds of all you people...

365
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:59,040
...because they're weapons against you. I
knew it would get through to you, DaSilva.

366
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:03,960
And if there's any way,
Wulfgar will know it too.

367
00:40:04,080 --> 00:40:07,160
He will know the backgrounds
of each of you people.

368
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:11,040
What's valuable to you.
Make you live in fear.

369
00:40:12,120 --> 00:40:16,680
You people have no idea of the extent of
the underground in your own city, do you?

370
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:19,280
That's the technique of terror.

371
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:21,880
How do you like it?

372
00:40:24,280 --> 00:40:26,240
I'm out.

373
00:40:30,520 --> 00:40:32,800
Thank you, everyone. That'll be all.

374
00:40:32,920 --> 00:40:36,240
- Just listen to me...
- I don't want any part of it any more.

375
00:40:36,360 --> 00:40:37,960
I know, but listen...

376
00:40:38,080 --> 00:40:40,880
- He didn't have to say about my wife...
- Listen, listen.

377
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:44,640
He's asking us to commit ourselves
to stopping a terrorist...

378
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:49,960
...who's capable of wiping out hundreds
of people in one shot, just like that.

379
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:54,000
You're one of the best.
He's looking at you as one of the best.

380
00:40:54,120 --> 00:40:58,320
And you can't back off now.
You gotta stay with it.

381
00:41:00,080 --> 00:41:02,760
Think about it, OK? It's up to you.

382
00:41:46,320 --> 00:41:48,280
What's this?

383
00:41:54,280 --> 00:41:56,120
Oh.

384
00:41:56,240 --> 00:41:58,200
Shit.

385
00:42:00,840 --> 00:42:02,800
Jesus.

386
00:42:31,320 --> 00:42:33,720
Let me help you.

387
00:42:33,840 --> 00:42:35,720
I didn't mean it.

388
00:42:35,840 --> 00:42:38,280
I couldn't help wondering...
what was in there.

389
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:40,360
I know.

390
00:42:42,840 --> 00:42:45,400
- It doesn't matter.
- No...

391
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:49,680
- Please, I won't tell anyone. Don't worry.
- It's OK.

392
00:42:51,840 --> 00:42:54,200
You mustn't be worried.

393
00:42:57,240 --> 00:42:59,600
You go to a better life.

394
00:43:13,640 --> 00:43:15,880
I don't want that transfer.

395
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,600
- No?
- But I'll be honest with you.

396
00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:23,560
I don't know if I could take
that shot with innocent people around.

397
00:43:32,040 --> 00:43:36,040
"Deke DaSilva, drafted into the army,
August 41969."

398
00:43:36,160 --> 00:43:38,360
"Volunteered for Airborne School."

399
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:41,160
"Accepted by Officer's Candidate School."

400
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:44,720
"Reassigned, first lieutenant,
First Cavalry Division, Vietnam."

401
00:43:44,840 --> 00:43:46,720
And much more.

402
00:43:46,840 --> 00:43:49,800
The most interesting statistic is...

403
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:54,920
...52 registered kills in combat service.

404
00:43:58,320 --> 00:44:03,840
One would have said that you were quite
adept at pulling the trigger, wouldn't one?

405
00:44:06,120 --> 00:44:07,480
That was war.

406
00:44:09,800 --> 00:44:15,640
Let me just say that I have a feeling
you'll do the right thing at the right time.

407
00:44:21,320 --> 00:44:23,400
Good evening, DaSilva.

408
00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:50,400
- No hace nada.
- Hay que botarlo, porque no sirve.

409
00:44:50,520 --> 00:44:53,880
- Carajo.
- Carajo. Te veo. Ya te lo apunto, ya.

410
00:44:55,480 --> 00:44:57,760
I'll have the special Cuban melon.

411
00:44:57,880 --> 00:45:00,320
Don't sell melon here.

412
00:45:00,440 --> 00:45:02,880
Didn't I read your ad
in the personal column?

413
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:05,160
Carajo, yo no advertise.

414
00:45:08,160 --> 00:45:09,960
Maybe Wulfgar was wrong.

415
00:45:11,840 --> 00:45:13,400
Wulfgar.

416
00:45:18,720 --> 00:45:20,600
- Yes?
- They found a stewardess dead.

417
00:45:20,720 --> 00:45:21,760
What stewardess?

418
00:45:21,880 --> 00:45:26,720
If you guys at the command centre haven't
heard of this girl, maybe it's time you did.

419
00:45:26,840 --> 00:45:30,960
We're not sure who her boyfriend was,
but we've gone through her souvenirs.

420
00:45:31,080 --> 00:45:34,120
It's like a map of every discotheque
and singles bar in town.

421
00:45:34,240 --> 00:45:36,760
- What's that to do with us?
- No, nothin' unusual...

422
00:45:36,880 --> 00:45:39,640
...except one thing that doesn't belong.

423
00:45:40,440 --> 00:45:44,360
A map of the Wall Street area.
The street that was bombed was circled.

424
00:45:44,840 --> 00:45:47,800
I want you and Fox to hit all the places
she might've hung out.

425
00:45:47,920 --> 00:45:51,200
- Somebody might have a bead on her.
- All right, we're on it.

426
00:46:01,360 --> 00:46:03,160
- I never saw her.
- Are you sure?

427
00:46:03,280 --> 00:46:05,000
- Positive.
- Absolutely positive?

428
00:46:05,120 --> 00:46:09,080
- I never saw her.
- If you hear of anything, give us a call.

429
00:46:16,720 --> 00:46:18,880
- No?
- Maybe, maybe.

430
00:46:20,040 --> 00:46:21,400
If you think of anything...

431
00:46:21,520 --> 00:46:25,280
- Ever seen that girl around here?
- No, I don't think so.

432
00:46:26,080 --> 00:46:30,360
Look, if you remember anything,
call me at that number, all right?

433
00:46:42,480 --> 00:46:44,560
No, no. Never seen her before.

434
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:49,000
Why don't you look again?

435
00:46:49,120 --> 00:46:51,200
Don't remember her. Do you?

436
00:46:53,160 --> 00:46:55,160
Yeah, she's been here.

437
00:46:55,280 --> 00:46:57,080
When?

438
00:46:57,200 --> 00:47:00,320
- Maybe a couple of weeks ago.
- Do you remember who she was with?

439
00:47:00,440 --> 00:47:04,040
Yeah, a guy with blond hair,
dressed pretty good.

440
00:47:04,160 --> 00:47:06,960
- Has he been here tonight?
- I ain't seen him.

441
00:47:07,080 --> 00:47:09,520
We just wanna
look around a while, all right?

442
00:47:09,640 --> 00:47:12,840
OK. Go with him, Mike.
Don't hassle anyone, OK?

443
00:47:12,960 --> 00:47:15,520
- May I have your coats?
- Thank you.

444
00:47:55,200 --> 00:47:56,960
This way.

445
00:49:23,440 --> 00:49:26,680
- What do you think?
- I don't think he's here.

446
00:49:27,400 --> 00:49:30,320
We're gonna stick around for a while.

447
00:49:30,440 --> 00:49:32,000
All right.

448
00:50:14,200 --> 00:50:17,200
Come on, Deke.
Why don't we check out another place?

449
00:50:17,320 --> 00:50:19,280
Wait. Wait.

450
00:50:21,480 --> 00:50:22,560
What?

451
00:50:23,160 --> 00:50:27,120
Let's say I did this...
Cut this off, added this.

452
00:50:28,880 --> 00:50:31,600
He could look something like that,
couldn't he?

453
00:50:31,720 --> 00:50:33,600
Yeah, I guess so. Why?

454
00:50:33,720 --> 00:50:37,360
Because that... is standing over there.

455
00:50:44,040 --> 00:50:47,400
- I got a feeling.
- You wanna go check him out?

456
00:52:12,840 --> 00:52:14,280
Wulfgar!

457
00:52:48,240 --> 00:52:50,680
Police! Move! Move!

458
00:52:58,280 --> 00:53:01,040
You dumb jerk!
You wanna get killed?!

459
00:53:15,840 --> 00:53:17,800
I'll go this way!

460
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:33,440
- He went that way.
- In here!

461
00:54:46,320 --> 00:54:49,640
- That's seven. He should be out.
- I hope you're right!

462
00:54:52,440 --> 00:54:54,200
Now!

463
00:54:59,040 --> 00:55:00,800
Dammit!

464
00:55:11,440 --> 00:55:13,520
Police! Move! Get outta the way!

465
00:55:18,240 --> 00:55:20,800
Get outta the way! Move!

466
00:55:21,320 --> 00:55:22,880
You got him?

467
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:25,960
I don't see him!

468
00:55:32,040 --> 00:55:33,280
I got him!

469
00:55:33,400 --> 00:55:35,520
I lost him!

470
00:55:37,440 --> 00:55:39,040
I got him! I got him!

471
00:55:39,800 --> 00:55:41,960
Scream!

472
00:55:46,200 --> 00:55:48,680
Stand away! Move!

473
00:55:48,800 --> 00:55:51,080
- Get outta the way!
- Shoot!

474
00:55:52,400 --> 00:55:54,160
Shoot!

475
00:55:56,400 --> 00:55:58,440
Idiot! Take the shot!

476
00:55:59,240 --> 00:56:01,200
He's not clear.

477
00:56:02,320 --> 00:56:04,080
Dammit!

478
00:56:33,760 --> 00:56:35,520
Move!

479
00:56:43,560 --> 00:56:45,520
Jump, Deke, jump!

480
00:56:55,520 --> 00:56:57,480
Come on, I got you.

481
00:57:00,080 --> 00:57:03,280
- It's locked.
- Get back. I'm gonna kick it open.

482
00:57:11,160 --> 00:57:12,920
Police!

483
00:57:19,040 --> 00:57:20,880
Police! Get back!

484
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:23,800
Get outta the way! Stand back!

485
00:57:34,920 --> 00:57:36,880
Are you all right?

486
00:57:46,040 --> 00:57:48,800
- Police!
- Move! Get outta the way!

487
00:57:48,920 --> 00:57:50,880
Come on, goddamnit!

488
00:58:02,080 --> 00:58:04,040
Get back! Move!

489
00:58:19,320 --> 00:58:21,080
Move!

490
00:58:28,240 --> 00:58:30,200
- I got him this way!
- Watch out.

491
00:58:41,320 --> 00:58:43,040
Goddamnit!

492
00:58:43,920 --> 00:58:45,880
Fox!

493
00:58:46,520 --> 00:58:49,040
Deke! Deke!

494
00:58:49,160 --> 00:58:50,960
Don't move. Jesus Christ!

495
00:58:51,080 --> 00:58:53,720
- God, I'm hurt.
- Get on back, goddamnit!

496
00:58:53,840 --> 00:58:56,000
Get some help!
I'll kill that son of a bitch.

497
00:58:56,120 --> 00:58:58,120
- Get him!
- Don't move.

498
00:58:58,240 --> 00:59:00,680
- Get him, Deke!
- I'm gonna kill that son of a bitch.

499
00:59:00,800 --> 00:59:03,120
- Get him!
- Don't move. You're fuckin' dead!

500
00:59:03,240 --> 00:59:06,600
I'll kill that motherfucker.
You're fuckin' dead!

501
00:59:06,720 --> 00:59:08,560
You're fuckin' dead!

502
00:59:08,680 --> 00:59:13,440
I'm gonna kill that motherfucker.
You're fuckin' dead, you motherfucker!

503
00:59:14,440 --> 00:59:16,600
You're fuckin' dead!

504
00:59:33,320 --> 00:59:35,280
How you doin'?

505
00:59:36,760 --> 00:59:39,160
The doctor said you have great reflexes.

506
00:59:39,280 --> 00:59:44,800
You caught that blade on the jawbone,
so it didn't touch anything vital.

507
00:59:44,920 --> 00:59:47,720
Before you know it,
you'll be back at the command centre.

508
00:59:47,840 --> 00:59:49,800
OK? Good as new?

509
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:52,960
- Deke...
- What?

510
00:59:56,960 --> 00:59:59,200
You shoulda took that shot.

511
01:00:01,240 --> 01:00:03,520
You shoulda took the shot.

512
01:00:36,120 --> 01:00:38,480
Close the shop.

513
01:00:53,720 --> 01:00:55,600
Wulfgar.

514
01:00:56,280 --> 01:00:59,440
The police have
a description of you, Wulfgar.

515
01:01:00,320 --> 01:01:03,080
And by now, every delegation
at the UN has it too.

516
01:01:04,840 --> 01:01:06,800
It doesn't matter.

517
01:01:07,800 --> 01:01:11,200
I was wondering
when you would come here.

518
01:01:11,320 --> 01:01:13,000
Have you seen Hammad?

519
01:01:13,120 --> 01:01:16,760
Hammad is beginning to pay attention.
He's not ready to take you back yet.

520
01:01:16,880 --> 01:01:18,840
Soon he'll beg.

521
01:01:24,400 --> 01:01:26,920
How did they trace me so soon?
I don't understand.

522
01:01:27,040 --> 01:01:29,000
- You must know...
- What?

523
01:01:29,120 --> 01:01:31,080
Hartman.

524
01:01:33,760 --> 01:01:36,120
- Hartman? Here?
- Yes.

525
01:01:38,120 --> 01:01:40,080
You're just in time.

526
01:01:41,440 --> 01:01:45,200
I need all the information
you can get on the UN personnel.

527
01:01:46,120 --> 01:01:48,280
Hartman's people, too.

528
01:01:49,320 --> 01:01:53,160
Especially the name of the bastard
who chased me tonight.

529
01:01:54,960 --> 01:01:56,720
Have you been all right?

530
01:01:56,840 --> 01:01:58,960
Well, yeah, fine. Why?

531
01:01:59,520 --> 01:02:01,960
I want you to be
a bit more careful, that's all.

532
01:02:02,480 --> 01:02:05,680
- You still haven't told me why.
- Irene, do me a favor this one time.

533
01:02:05,800 --> 01:02:09,400
- Don't meet any new people right now.
- I wanna know why.

534
01:02:09,520 --> 01:02:12,040
Why can't you just
do what I say one time?

535
01:02:13,120 --> 01:02:16,120
You haven't talked like this before.
What are you working on?

536
01:02:16,240 --> 01:02:19,280
If you'd like to talk about it,
I'd be happy to listen.

537
01:02:19,400 --> 01:02:23,080
No, it'd take too long to explain.
It's too complicated to go into now.

538
01:02:23,200 --> 01:02:26,680
- We'll talk later.
- Well, all right. How about this?

539
01:02:27,280 --> 01:02:31,120
Why don't we have dinner
together next weekend?

540
01:02:31,240 --> 01:02:33,600
At your favorite little Italian restaurant?

541
01:02:33,720 --> 01:02:35,840
Did I say something that brought that on?

542
01:02:36,600 --> 01:02:37,600
Maybe.

543
01:02:38,280 --> 01:02:40,840
- Are you serious?
- Absolutely.

544
01:02:41,320 --> 01:02:44,960
Well, how about I make the reservations?
I'll call you on Friday.

545
01:02:45,080 --> 01:02:47,040
- OK. Bye.
- Bye.

546
01:03:36,360 --> 01:03:38,320
Is this all?

547
01:03:39,400 --> 01:03:41,360
Yes.

548
01:03:45,360 --> 01:03:47,320
Then we're ready.

549
01:04:34,280 --> 01:04:37,440
The French assistant
ambassador's leaving.

550
01:04:39,600 --> 01:04:41,360
OK, good. How are you feelin'?

551
01:04:43,720 --> 01:04:46,000
I love watching other people
have a good time.

552
01:04:53,520 --> 01:04:56,840
Gentlemen, proceed with
your checkpoints, please.

553
01:04:57,480 --> 01:05:01,240
And let the guests see you.
Keeps them from getting nervous.

554
01:05:01,360 --> 01:05:04,440
Checkpoint one all clear.
Checkpoint two?

555
01:05:04,560 --> 01:05:06,440
South wing is all clear.

556
01:05:06,560 --> 01:05:09,280
I've got the Swedish delegate in here.

557
01:05:11,960 --> 01:05:15,520
- TV, check in, please.
- Pretty pictures here.

558
01:05:15,960 --> 01:05:19,240
- Elevator, check in, please.
- British ambassador's on his way.

559
01:05:19,840 --> 01:05:21,880
North side, check in.

560
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:23,800
- Everything's OK here.
- Roger.

561
01:05:23,920 --> 01:05:27,680
DaSilva, everything seems to be
under control up there.

562
01:05:27,800 --> 01:05:30,960
- Would you take Zone A?
- Sure. Listen...

563
01:05:31,080 --> 01:05:33,440
- Are you hungry?
- Mm. A bit.

564
01:05:33,560 --> 01:05:36,520
- Chinese food later?
- Look forward to it.

565
01:05:39,840 --> 01:05:41,320
- How's everything?
- Fine.

566
01:05:44,240 --> 01:05:47,400
Hartman, proceeding
to the south escalator.

567
01:05:48,960 --> 01:05:52,200
Hello, balcony?
German counsel's heading your way.

568
01:05:52,320 --> 01:05:54,320
OK, I see him.

569
01:05:54,440 --> 01:05:56,400
DaSilva, do you read me?

570
01:05:56,520 --> 01:05:57,520
Checkpoint one.

571
01:05:58,120 --> 01:06:00,800
DaSilva, by the way...
Who's picking up the check?

572
01:06:02,480 --> 01:06:05,000
Well, I believe in age
before beauty, don't you?

573
01:06:12,960 --> 01:06:14,920
Shakka.

574
01:06:29,880 --> 01:06:32,240
Watch out! Move outta the way! Get back!

575
01:06:32,360 --> 01:06:34,320
Don't turn him over!

576
01:06:37,280 --> 01:06:38,760
Shit.

577
01:06:38,880 --> 01:06:41,640
- All right, we got all the exits covered.
- Forget it.

578
01:06:41,760 --> 01:06:43,960
- What do you mean?
- She's gone. Forget it.

579
01:06:44,080 --> 01:06:47,240
- It's not his big play, anyway.
- How do you know?

580
01:06:48,880 --> 01:06:52,760
Because I'm beginning to know
how the son of a bitch thinks.

581
01:07:27,320 --> 01:07:29,320
Punch these up quick, all right?

582
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:46,640
Unexpected stop.

583
01:07:49,680 --> 01:07:52,120
This is Shakka.

584
01:07:52,880 --> 01:07:55,280
Do not underestimate her
because she's a woman.

585
01:07:55,400 --> 01:07:58,080
She has no maternal instincts.

586
01:07:58,200 --> 01:08:01,040
Don't be so afraid.
Back up, against the window!

587
01:08:01,160 --> 01:08:03,680
I like your hat.

588
01:08:04,720 --> 01:08:07,360
I'll be talking to you.
How old is that child?

589
01:08:07,480 --> 01:08:09,720
- He's just eight months.
- OK.

590
01:08:09,840 --> 01:08:12,200
- Comment ça va?
- Bonjour.

591
01:08:13,480 --> 01:08:15,680
- Du är svensk?
- Ja.

592
01:08:21,760 --> 01:08:25,120
- This is Wulfgar calling.
- Get me 911, please.

593
01:08:25,240 --> 01:08:30,000
There are certain representatives
of the United Nations with me.

594
01:08:31,040 --> 01:08:34,400
I'll announce my terms for their release...

595
01:08:34,520 --> 01:08:37,680
...when the proper authorities
are present to hear them.

596
01:08:38,320 --> 01:08:40,360
I got it.

597
01:08:42,080 --> 01:08:43,080
Right.

598
01:08:43,200 --> 01:08:45,280
DaSilva, Fox. Wulfgar's on the tram.

599
01:08:52,200 --> 01:08:53,760
Please.

600
01:08:53,880 --> 01:08:56,400
I'm aware of every trick.

601
01:08:56,520 --> 01:08:58,680
Do not force me to prove it.

602
01:09:00,040 --> 01:09:02,000
Thank you.

603
01:09:02,720 --> 01:09:05,480
Now... we'll get better acquainted.

604
01:09:15,920 --> 01:09:17,880
Let's go!

605
01:09:26,160 --> 01:09:30,120
- You have three children, right?
- How do you know that?

606
01:10:15,400 --> 01:10:16,800
All the lines are open.

607
01:10:16,920 --> 01:10:19,760
Detective Munafo, Sergeant Fox.
Gimme your binoculars.

608
01:10:24,160 --> 01:10:25,680
Take it over the bridge.

609
01:10:39,760 --> 01:10:42,640
Face the windows, everybody! Quickly!

610
01:10:51,280 --> 01:10:53,640
- Can you see him?
- Yes, I see him.

611
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:58,040
Shakka's with him
and he has about 25 hostages.

612
01:10:59,680 --> 01:11:03,560
He's doing something at
the back of the car. Wait a minute.

613
01:11:03,680 --> 01:11:07,560
Your husband is first assistant to
the French ambassador, is he not?

614
01:11:07,680 --> 01:11:10,360
Please... leave us alone.
We've done nothing.

615
01:11:10,480 --> 01:11:12,840
You must be very proud.
You will come over...

616
01:11:12,960 --> 01:11:15,200
- No, you take me!
- Sh.

617
01:11:15,320 --> 01:11:17,960
What is it? What is happening?

618
01:11:18,080 --> 01:11:20,040
Life, Mr Marigny.

619
01:11:20,560 --> 01:11:23,360
No... it's not...

620
01:11:24,080 --> 01:11:27,720
He's taken a woman to the front
of the tram. He has her against a window.

621
01:11:27,840 --> 01:11:31,720
- What the hell is he doing?
- He's making the rules.

622
01:11:31,840 --> 01:11:34,080
Get a little closer. I wanna see his face.

623
01:11:41,400 --> 01:11:43,200
This one's for you, DaSilva.

624
01:11:43,320 --> 01:11:44,760
Christ. Don't do it.

625
01:11:46,640 --> 01:11:50,920
- Goddamnit, Matt, he killed her.
- I requested no police.

626
01:11:51,040 --> 01:11:53,920
Get rid of the body.

627
01:12:16,160 --> 01:12:18,480
This is Wulfgar calling.

628
01:12:19,280 --> 01:12:21,960
Yes, we hear you.
This is Sergeant Fox.

629
01:12:22,080 --> 01:12:27,040
If the UN authorities are present,
I'm ready to proceed.

630
01:12:27,560 --> 01:12:31,480
I've been instructed to ask if you would
release all non-political hostages.

631
01:12:31,600 --> 01:12:33,440
You are wasting your time.

632
01:12:33,560 --> 01:12:38,080
- As you see, I am not to be taken lightly.
- We hear you.

633
01:12:38,640 --> 01:12:42,240
Before we go any further...
there's an infant here.

634
01:12:42,360 --> 01:12:44,400
I want it taken off.

635
01:12:44,520 --> 01:12:48,440
I don't want the press to write
that I'm a man without a conscience.

636
01:12:48,560 --> 01:12:52,920
- All right, what do you want?
- In five minutes, I'll lower a cable.

637
01:12:53,680 --> 01:12:58,320
If you want the infant alive...
you'd better hurry.

638
01:12:58,800 --> 01:13:01,320
- I'll be ready.
- Not you, Fox!

639
01:13:01,440 --> 01:13:03,800
I want that bastard!

640
01:13:04,920 --> 01:13:07,040
What bastard?

641
01:13:07,160 --> 01:13:07,920
Me.

642
01:13:18,680 --> 01:13:20,960
You can't let him go up there.
He'll waste him!

643
01:13:21,080 --> 01:13:24,600
Look, I'm in charge here, Fox!
DaSilva's the man.

644
01:14:09,120 --> 01:14:10,480
The barge is nearly in place.

645
01:15:11,680 --> 01:15:13,880
How do you feel?

646
01:15:14,840 --> 01:15:16,600
Helpless?

647
01:15:16,720 --> 01:15:20,280
I could have cut the cable.
It's a long way down.

648
01:15:23,280 --> 01:15:25,720
- Why'd you kill the woman?
- I wanted to.

649
01:15:25,840 --> 01:15:28,160
So why don't you kill me?

650
01:15:29,200 --> 01:15:30,560
In due time.

651
01:15:33,320 --> 01:15:37,160
I want you to tell 'em
I have brought the city to its knees.

652
01:15:37,280 --> 01:15:40,120
Police... are cowards.

653
01:15:40,520 --> 01:15:42,080
What?

654
01:15:42,200 --> 01:15:45,080
I said... tell 'em.

655
01:15:51,360 --> 01:15:53,320
He's brought the city to its knees.

656
01:15:56,400 --> 01:15:57,920
The police are cowards.

657
01:16:01,680 --> 01:16:04,200
We're not that different, Deke.

658
01:16:05,440 --> 01:16:10,440
I do not enjoy killing, but it's my job.
Someone has to do it.

659
01:16:10,760 --> 01:16:15,120
I represent... oppressed victims
who have nothing.

660
01:16:15,760 --> 01:16:18,720
I speak only for them. I'm their voice.

661
01:16:19,400 --> 01:16:21,640
I'm a liberator.

662
01:16:21,760 --> 01:16:24,200
You think you're a liberator?

663
01:16:25,440 --> 01:16:28,280
It's fascinating. Yes.

664
01:16:30,280 --> 01:16:32,840
- The child!
- No! No!

665
01:16:33,600 --> 01:16:35,760
Come on. Come on!

666
01:16:37,320 --> 01:16:40,280
- Give it to me!
- Please be careful with him.

667
01:16:50,280 --> 01:16:52,240
Sit down.

668
01:16:53,200 --> 01:16:55,120
This is for the press.

669
01:16:55,240 --> 01:16:57,640
- Now, you may drop the child...
- Oh, no!

670
01:16:57,760 --> 01:17:00,800
- Don't drop this.
- He'll be all right.

671
01:17:02,160 --> 01:17:04,800
What if you don't win this time?

672
01:17:04,920 --> 01:17:06,560
Try again.

673
01:17:06,680 --> 01:17:08,960
Shakka, lower him.

674
01:17:09,080 --> 01:17:11,520
Please be careful with him!

675
01:17:16,440 --> 01:17:18,680
Deke, you must realize...

676
01:17:19,360 --> 01:17:22,120
...we're not heroes, we're victims.

677
01:17:34,520 --> 01:17:36,480
This is Wulfgar.

678
01:17:38,120 --> 01:17:40,400
- Go ahead.
- These are my demands.

679
01:17:40,520 --> 01:17:42,560
I gave DaSilva a declaration...

680
01:17:42,720 --> 01:17:45,640
...to be published in
The Times and The Washington Post...

681
01:17:45,760 --> 01:17:47,600
...and read over all networks.

682
01:17:47,720 --> 01:17:50,720
- We don't control the press.
- No excuses!

683
01:17:51,280 --> 01:17:54,960
I want a jet and a bus to the airport
by ten o'clock tonight.

684
01:17:55,320 --> 01:17:57,560
And no police.

685
01:17:57,680 --> 01:17:59,240
The following comrades...

686
01:17:59,360 --> 01:18:02,240
...are to be released before ten o'clock.

687
01:18:02,360 --> 01:18:05,440
Mohammed Yafi, Rafael Saldaña...

688
01:18:05,560 --> 01:18:09,120
...Miroslav Jakovic, Liu Chan Tao.

689
01:18:11,360 --> 01:18:14,720
- May we have until morning?
- Ten o'clock sharp.

690
01:18:15,920 --> 01:18:18,680
And DaSilva... will drive the bus.

691
01:18:29,560 --> 01:18:31,720
We may not make it this time.

692
01:18:34,600 --> 01:18:36,560
It does not matter.

693
01:18:42,960 --> 01:18:47,040
Let me have the cassette recording
of Hartman's last lecture on Shakka...

694
01:18:47,160 --> 01:18:52,600
...the smallest tape recorder you can find,
ten feet of wire and an activator button.

695
01:19:30,040 --> 01:19:32,520
Shakka Holland,
alias Shakka Kapoor...

696
01:19:34,040 --> 01:19:37,320
The drama has not seen
a change for the better or worse.

697
01:19:37,440 --> 01:19:42,800
The hostages still remain over 250 feet
above the East River in a cable car.

698
01:19:42,920 --> 01:19:45,920
Several hours ago an innocent woman
was sent to her death...

699
01:19:46,040 --> 01:19:50,440
...by that terrorist known only as Wulfgar
and a single female companion.

700
01:19:50,560 --> 01:19:52,760
Moments after that savage killing...

701
01:19:52,880 --> 01:19:56,000
...that same terrorist demanded
an infant be taken to safety.

702
01:19:56,120 --> 01:19:57,720
For those who tuned in late...

703
01:20:04,040 --> 01:20:06,800
- You sure you know what you're doing?
- I think so.

704
01:20:06,920 --> 01:20:10,040
You know when that bus gets to
the airport he's gonna waste you.

705
01:20:10,160 --> 01:20:12,760
Why are you always tryin' to cheer me up?

706
01:20:12,880 --> 01:20:15,720
- You said before, it's my choice.
- I did say that, didn't I?

707
01:20:15,840 --> 01:20:18,600
- I'll see you later.
- I'll be watching.

708
01:20:49,400 --> 01:20:51,480
I'm coming in.

709
01:21:52,400 --> 01:21:54,360
No talking.

710
01:21:56,200 --> 01:21:58,160
Move! Come on!

711
01:22:02,840 --> 01:22:04,480
Move!

712
01:22:43,040 --> 01:22:44,840
Move!

713
01:23:29,720 --> 01:23:31,680
Soon it is your time.

714
01:23:32,800 --> 01:23:35,120
Come on! Hurry up! Quick!

715
01:23:41,400 --> 01:23:44,160
Shakka Holland,
alias Shakka Kapoor...

716
01:23:44,280 --> 01:23:48,720
...born February 91949, Tangiers, Morocco,
of wealthy parents.

717
01:23:48,840 --> 01:23:51,720
A spoilt bitch
who kills without provocation.

718
01:23:51,840 --> 01:23:53,000
You shit!

719
01:23:55,520 --> 01:23:57,600
Get down!

720
01:24:59,680 --> 01:25:01,480
Deke! Deke!

721
01:25:01,600 --> 01:25:04,040
They found an address on Shakka.

722
01:25:10,720 --> 01:25:13,120
Where the hell is he?

723
01:25:13,240 --> 01:25:15,200
I don't know. Come on.

724
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:36,360
Don't stop. Keep moving.

725
01:25:41,240 --> 01:25:44,840
I don't care what you think.
He might still have keys to the apartment.

726
01:25:44,960 --> 01:25:47,080
Anybody comes or goes,
you check it out.

727
01:25:54,240 --> 01:25:57,040
We haven't found a body,
but we got everything covered.

728
01:25:57,160 --> 01:26:00,920
Well, keep looking.
He probably left something behind.

729
01:26:03,600 --> 01:26:06,000
- What is it?
- Wait a minute.

730
01:26:14,200 --> 01:26:16,000
Christ!

731
01:27:05,880 --> 01:27:08,360
Evening, ma'am. Chilly, isn't it?
