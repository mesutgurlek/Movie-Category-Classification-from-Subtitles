1
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:36,280
Only minutes away from midnight,
here at the fabulous Jade Park Hotel in Hong Kong...

2
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:39,280
...it's a star-studded event,
typical of the man they call...

3
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:41,570
...the Donald Trump of Asia, David Chan.

4
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:44,330
Sir, what are your last thoughts
as the 20th century fades?

5
00:02:44,370 --> 00:02:47,750
Well, tonight, we join the rest of the world
in celebrating the new millennium.

6
00:02:47,830 --> 00:02:50,750
But, next month,
we Chinese begin the year of the dragon.

7
00:02:50,830 --> 00:02:54,000
The year 4698.

8
00:02:54,380 --> 00:02:56,050
Has it been that long?

9
00:02:56,130 --> 00:02:59,590
But, seriously,
celebrating the new Western millennium...

10
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:02,800
...it's quite a symbolic moment for China,
Hong Kong and myself.

11
00:03:02,890 --> 00:03:06,600
Vitality and creativity of the West,
wisdom and experience of the East.

12
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:09,810
The fun's about to begin,
ladies and gentlemen. Please, join us.

13
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:51,600
What is he waiting for?

14
00:03:54,980 --> 00:03:56,400
What are you waiting for?

15
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:59,110
Novak, I'm experiencing the moment.

16
00:04:00,950 --> 00:04:03,660
He's gonna experience
a Chinese labor camp moment...

17
00:04:03,740 --> 00:04:06,120
...if he doesn't stick to schedule.

18
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:10,540
We are 10 minutes away,
and he's sight-seeing.

19
00:04:10,790 --> 00:04:13,460
Don't worry about it.
I'm always right on time.

20
00:04:14,290 --> 00:04:15,630
All right, kids.

21
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,340
We're good to go.

22
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:49,620
Got it.

23
00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:51,250
Good stuff.

24
00:04:51,330 --> 00:04:52,910
Not so good.

25
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:55,710
Thought you said
he worked facing the window.

26
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:57,250
He does.

27
00:04:57,960 --> 00:04:59,300
Not today.

28
00:05:03,090 --> 00:05:05,130
He can't see where the infrared port is.

29
00:05:05,890 --> 00:05:06,640
Hold on.

30
00:05:07,260 --> 00:05:11,220
You can never pay too much
for good intelligence.

31
00:05:11,770 --> 00:05:13,390
Or a good hooker.

32
00:05:15,060 --> 00:05:16,060
The ball is up.

33
00:05:17,610 --> 00:05:18,690
We're receiving.

34
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:31,450
Now, please, join with me
in counting us down...

35
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:34,040
...into China's new future.

36
00:05:34,210 --> 00:05:35,040
Ready?

37
00:05:45,010 --> 00:05:45,880
Three.

38
00:05:46,260 --> 00:05:47,430
Two.

39
00:05:47,890 --> 00:05:48,970
One!

40
00:05:51,970 --> 00:05:52,930
What is it?

41
00:05:53,060 --> 00:05:54,140
What's wrong?

42
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:56,600
Is it Y2K?

43
00:05:58,650 --> 00:05:59,690
Is it Y2K?

44
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:04,070
No, no. It can't be.

45
00:06:06,150 --> 00:06:08,280
Not in my city!

46
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:10,320
Happy New Year!

47
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:32,390
Happy New Year.

48
00:06:33,140 --> 00:06:34,640
Coming at you.

49
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:45,190
Okay, I got him.

50
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:52,370
-You like?
-You like this?

51
00:07:06,130 --> 00:07:07,720
Thirteen, fourteen-year-old girls.

52
00:07:08,470 --> 00:07:09,800
Sick fuck.

53
00:07:12,350 --> 00:07:13,930
That's good.

54
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:16,680
Did you get that?

55
00:07:18,850 --> 00:07:19,560
Yeah.

56
00:07:20,020 --> 00:07:20,940
Let's do it.

57
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:28,280
Phone.

58
00:07:28,690 --> 00:07:30,070
Here we go.

59
00:07:36,660 --> 00:07:39,160
-Happy New Year, Defense Minister.
-Who is speaking?

60
00:07:39,870 --> 00:07:41,960
You could think of me as your conscience.

61
00:07:44,250 --> 00:07:45,000
Sending.

62
00:07:45,420 --> 00:07:48,960
Maybe you should direct your attention
to the big screen.

63
00:08:05,020 --> 00:08:07,530
Last month, you took $90 million
of UN aid money...

64
00:08:07,610 --> 00:08:09,860
...and spent it
on Chinese missile technology.

65
00:08:09,940 --> 00:08:13,240
That money was for flood victims
and starving children.

66
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:15,780
Now I'm quite sure that
North Korean government won't mind...

67
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:18,410
...but how do you think the world press
is going to react to that?

68
00:08:19,410 --> 00:08:20,500
What do you want?

69
00:08:20,710 --> 00:08:23,710
I want you back at the negotiating table
with South Korea tomorrow.

70
00:08:23,790 --> 00:08:24,710
That is impossible.

71
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,040
Sending.

72
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:34,550
Well, just take a look at your monitor.

73
00:08:40,060 --> 00:08:43,020
Well, if it's still an impossibility,
press "1" on your keypad.

74
00:08:43,190 --> 00:08:44,600
If it's a possibility....

75
00:08:46,730 --> 00:08:48,360
Excellent choice.

76
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:04,080
I think I've been made.

77
00:09:07,590 --> 00:09:08,250
Shaw?

78
00:09:08,380 --> 00:09:11,130
I'm picking up a lot of chatter
on the security channel.

79
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:17,760
The man next to Chan is Alex Wingate.

80
00:09:18,010 --> 00:09:19,060
Media mogul.

81
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:22,810
United States, united Europe, united China.
There's no difference.

82
00:09:23,390 --> 00:09:25,190
Our blood is 68 percent Coca-Cola.

83
00:09:25,270 --> 00:09:28,770
Opening China's doors to the West
is a little more complicated than that.

84
00:09:28,940 --> 00:09:32,490
Oh alex, you know we'll try to contribute
what we can to make it easier.

85
00:09:32,570 --> 00:09:34,240
And you, sir, who might you be?

86
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:36,740
Me? I'm Eddie Murphy.

87
00:09:38,450 --> 00:09:39,950
Would you hold this, please?

88
00:09:43,290 --> 00:09:44,620
He hit me!

89
00:10:07,350 --> 00:10:08,520
Okay, go to Phase 2.

90
00:10:14,530 --> 00:10:15,860
Right. Yeah, I got it.

91
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:18,130
I know what's coming.

92
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:52,420
I'm coming in.

93
00:11:53,420 --> 00:11:54,710
Line up with the van.

94
00:11:54,790 --> 00:11:55,920
Straight approach.

95
00:12:41,170 --> 00:12:42,880
Mr. Secretary-General...

96
00:12:43,010 --> 00:12:46,970
...give any comment on North Korea's
return to the peace negotiations?

97
00:12:47,220 --> 00:12:49,140
How were you able to achieve this?

98
00:12:49,220 --> 00:12:50,680
Common sense...

99
00:12:51,060 --> 00:12:55,480
...patience, mutual respect
and an abiding understanding that...

100
00:12:55,650 --> 00:12:59,440
...there are cultural differences.
And we're all gonna live with them.

101
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:03,320
Secretary-General Douglas Thomas
leaves the UN after a successful return...

102
00:13:03,450 --> 00:13:06,200
...to peace negotiations
for North and South Korea.

103
00:13:06,740 --> 00:13:07,910
Great.

104
00:13:08,660 --> 00:13:12,790
I'm gonna become another one of those
famous Canadian peacekeepers.

105
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:14,330
Not famous.

106
00:13:14,420 --> 00:13:18,250
Do you know how many Americans
can name the Secretary-General of the UN?

107
00:13:18,460 --> 00:13:19,500
Three percent.

108
00:13:20,050 --> 00:13:21,840
Well, that's all about to change...

109
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:25,470
...because the press adore you,
and UN support is on the upswing.

110
00:13:25,550 --> 00:13:28,680
There'd be hell to pay
if they ever found out about your tactics.

111
00:13:28,890 --> 00:13:32,930
I know it's unorthodox,
but you cannot deny the results.

112
00:13:34,140 --> 00:13:36,770
You know, if this treaty with China
could just go through...

113
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:40,900
...the United Nations
could possibly become a world power.

114
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:42,690
It could.

115
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:48,280
Well nonetheless, I think we should put a cap
on covert operations for the time being.

116
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:54,870
How's your fellow doing?

117
00:13:55,750 --> 00:13:59,750
He needs a couple months to recover,
but he's in good spirits.

118
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:02,550
How do you give a medal to someone
who doesn't exist...

119
00:14:02,630 --> 00:14:04,220
...for something that didn't happen?

120
00:14:36,910 --> 00:14:38,870
I wouldn't give up your day job.

121
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:40,580
Well, well, well.

122
00:14:42,630 --> 00:14:43,500
Oh I'm sorry.

123
00:14:43,590 --> 00:14:47,090
-I thought it was the other shoulder.
-Yeah. Sure. I thought you quit.

124
00:14:48,130 --> 00:14:50,050
I did. This is my last one.

125
00:14:52,430 --> 00:14:53,890
It's a no-smoking court.

126
00:14:54,020 --> 00:14:54,890
Okay.

127
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:58,390
So wha-wha-what? You come down here to do what?
Force me into early retirement?

128
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:00,860
-Well you know, the thought crossed my mind.
-Yeah.

129
00:15:00,940 --> 00:15:03,860
But, to tell you the truth,
I was asked to check up on you.

130
00:15:06,150 --> 00:15:08,400
If Madam Hooks wants to find out
how I am...

131
00:15:08,450 --> 00:15:10,990
...why don't she come down here
and see for herself?

132
00:15:11,070 --> 00:15:13,990
Well you know as well as I do,
that Madam Hooks doesn't do anything...

133
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:16,790
...without gathering
a little intelligence first.

134
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:20,500
What? You?
You think you're qualified to test me?

135
00:15:21,170 --> 00:15:23,630
Considering your fragile condition...

136
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:26,460
...I think I can kick your ass.

137
00:15:29,180 --> 00:15:30,720
Okay. All right.

138
00:15:31,050 --> 00:15:32,550
- I'm ready.
-You ready?

139
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:40,730
-C'mon, you gonna shoot or dribble?
-What does it matter to you?

140
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:53,200
Oh, Goddamn it!

141
00:15:56,830 --> 00:15:57,950
Are you all right?

142
00:15:59,460 --> 00:16:00,620
Sorry.

143
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:02,540
Oh, Goddamn man, you're bleeding.

144
00:16:03,250 --> 00:16:05,500
-It's okay.
-No-no-no, hold on. Let me take a look.

145
00:16:05,590 --> 00:16:06,630
It's bleeding.

146
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:08,840
Damn.

147
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:13,340
Oh yeah, yeah.
You're gonna need some silk.

148
00:16:16,140 --> 00:16:17,260
That should do it.

149
00:16:17,850 --> 00:16:20,230
A nurse will be with you in a minute
to finish.

150
00:16:20,310 --> 00:16:21,640
Thank you.

151
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:26,570
It's a good thing I'm an asshole...

152
00:16:27,780 --> 00:16:29,400
...otherwise, I'd feel guilty.

153
00:16:29,490 --> 00:16:30,860
You should.

154
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:32,530
How is it?

155
00:16:32,610 --> 00:16:34,570
Oh he did a nice job.

156
00:16:34,870 --> 00:16:36,530
Those people make good doctors.

157
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:39,410
What?

158
00:16:40,370 --> 00:16:42,960
Asians. Chinese.
You know, they're smart and well-educated.

159
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:45,170
And what about these people?

160
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:48,590
These people have got to stop getting
shot on the job.

161
00:16:49,210 --> 00:16:50,380
I can arrange that.

162
00:16:50,630 --> 00:16:52,470
Well, you're too young to retire, so...

163
00:16:53,090 --> 00:16:55,510
Yeah, I'm young, but I ain't dumb.

164
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:14,450
Don't that burn?

165
00:17:14,950 --> 00:17:15,610
Yes.

166
00:17:16,030 --> 00:17:17,410
-Frank.
-What you got?

167
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:22,830
Fucking thing came off
a Chinese freighter yesterday.

168
00:17:22,910 --> 00:17:26,080
The longshoremen didn't think much of it.
Until the sun came up.

169
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:45,980
Shit.

170
00:17:52,230 --> 00:17:55,070
Our... forensic guy here picked this up.

171
00:17:55,650 --> 00:17:59,620
Oh, I- I don't speak that language,
so I wouldn't know what that means.

172
00:18:00,620 --> 00:18:02,950
Translator says it's Vietnamese.

173
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:06,710
Talks about the UN moving them
from some refugee camp in Hong Kong...

174
00:18:06,790 --> 00:18:10,340
-...looking for a new life in America.
-Hong Kong refugees. Ray!

175
00:18:10,420 --> 00:18:14,510
Call Amnesty. See if they can trace these
to the ones that disappeared last month.

176
00:18:14,590 --> 00:18:15,590
Yeah, sure, chief.

177
00:18:18,010 --> 00:18:19,050
Thanks.

178
00:18:20,430 --> 00:18:24,560
That's quite a statement,
if that's what they wanted to make. Guys!

179
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:28,020
Think it has something to do
with the big Chinese conference in town?

180
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:43,830
Under UN, the supervision.

181
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:48,500
"The fact remains that although these
refugees were housed in Hong Kong...

182
00:18:48,580 --> 00:18:51,250
"...they were under the supervision
of UN officers."

183
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:55,510
Sweatshop.

184
00:18:55,590 --> 00:18:57,590
"You talk of human rights.

185
00:18:57,680 --> 00:18:59,890
"Three miles from here, sweatshops.

186
00:19:01,260 --> 00:19:05,310
"A mile from here,
homeless people living in doorways.

187
00:19:06,390 --> 00:19:08,390
"Yet you lecture my country...

188
00:19:10,310 --> 00:19:12,020
"...on our human rights record.

189
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:16,900
-"The only right that concerns me--"
-Chinese Ambassador Jian Tze Wu.

190
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:23,030
In two days,
China signs a UN trade agreement...

191
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:27,200
...ending 50 years of isolation,
not only culturally, but commercially...

192
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:31,420
...opening the door
to 1.5 billion new consumers.

193
00:19:33,750 --> 00:19:37,340
And you think Ambassador Wu is connected
to the dead refugees from the boat?

194
00:19:38,380 --> 00:19:40,130
I have my suspicions.

195
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:44,850
Before becoming UN Ambassador, he was
responsible for refugee resettlement.

196
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:54,900
Here he is meeting with a group of
gentlemen tied to various Triad concerns.

197
00:19:55,820 --> 00:19:58,440
Hmm... human smugglers. Slave traders.

198
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:00,360
Exactly.

199
00:20:00,950 --> 00:20:03,990
My instinct tells me
something is lurking under the surface.

200
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:07,080
You always think something's lurking
under the surface.

201
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:11,460
Tonight, David Chan is hosting
a banquet honoring Ambassador Wu.

202
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:14,090
You want me to put a wire on Wu.

203
00:20:14,210 --> 00:20:16,800
If you're ready. How's the shoulder?

204
00:20:17,130 --> 00:20:18,590
Technically? Fucked up!

205
00:20:18,630 --> 00:20:20,340
There she is. Eleanor!

206
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:21,680
Here.

207
00:20:22,010 --> 00:20:24,050
I've been looking for you everywhere.

208
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:26,350
I don't believe we've met.

209
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:28,930
We still haven't, sir.

210
00:20:30,890 --> 00:20:34,560
Yes, of course.
Would you excuse us, please?

211
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:40,900
We've been watching the Security Council.
He was going nuts in there.

212
00:20:40,990 --> 00:20:42,360
Yes, I saw.

213
00:20:43,030 --> 00:20:45,160
Are you gonna do something about it?

214
00:20:45,450 --> 00:20:47,830
Oh, he's been briefed. We're moving forward.

215
00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:51,910
I'm guessing that Thomas is not a fan.

216
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,170
On the contrary.

217
00:20:53,290 --> 00:20:55,210
With the achievements of last year...

218
00:20:55,290 --> 00:20:57,750
...and the Chinese trade agreement
on the horizon.

219
00:20:58,130 --> 00:21:01,920
Thanks to you. One of the many reasons
I can't let you quit.

220
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:05,390
Look, Eleanor, I'm not one to complain...

221
00:21:05,590 --> 00:21:08,100
...but in the last two years
I've been shot twice...

222
00:21:08,180 --> 00:21:11,680
...I got six broken bones,
and I don't even have a health plan.

223
00:21:11,850 --> 00:21:14,270
You know we are owed billions
in dues payments.

224
00:21:14,350 --> 00:21:16,480
Every UN staff member
has taken cutbacks.

225
00:21:16,650 --> 00:21:19,480
Yes, so maybe I should make a move
before I get cut back...

226
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:22,490
...permanently. Find a career.

227
00:21:22,570 --> 00:21:23,860
Career? Like what?

228
00:21:24,610 --> 00:21:27,490
CIA, NSA?
There's no guarantee.

229
00:21:30,450 --> 00:21:31,450
McDonalds.

230
00:21:31,660 --> 00:21:33,080
Yeah, I'm gonna own one.

231
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:35,000
Yeah. Maybe two.

232
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:38,630
Listen to me.
Governments, they come, they go...

233
00:21:39,050 --> 00:21:42,380
...but the McDonalds, they last forever.

234
00:21:42,510 --> 00:21:44,630
All right. Your point is taken.

235
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:47,890
But right now we have a situation
that is rapidly deteriorating...

236
00:21:47,970 --> 00:21:49,600
...into a political time bomb.

237
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:52,810
No parachutes, no submachine guns,
just a simple eavesdrop, right?

238
00:21:54,140 --> 00:21:55,350
A walk in the park.

239
00:21:56,270 --> 00:21:57,810
This is New York City, baby.

240
00:21:57,940 --> 00:22:00,150
A simple walk in the park
can get you killed.

241
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:08,740
They want to sell us the benefits
of free trade! Free trade!

242
00:22:08,820 --> 00:22:12,370
How are trade deals made
when there is no accountability for Tibet...

243
00:22:12,450 --> 00:22:15,580
...Tiananmen, and dead refugees
arrive to our shores like cattle.

244
00:22:15,660 --> 00:22:18,580
Stop the UN deal!
Support human rights in China!

245
00:22:19,210 --> 00:22:22,000
Take that. The UN calls it free trade...

246
00:22:22,090 --> 00:22:25,170
...but this deal is about trade
at the expense of freedom.

247
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:26,180
Free Tibet!

248
00:22:26,260 --> 00:22:30,180
The magnificent hotel, recently purchased
by Chinese business mogul, David Chan...

249
00:22:30,260 --> 00:22:34,850
...is alive with diplomats who are welcoming
China into the world trade arena.

250
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:38,850
I didn't like it. Let's try another one.

251
00:22:39,650 --> 00:22:41,150
The magnificent hotel....

252
00:22:44,940 --> 00:22:46,650
Wait! Hold it! Hold it!

253
00:22:47,450 --> 00:22:48,450
I'm sorry.

254
00:22:54,290 --> 00:22:56,120
Your microphone is poking into me.

255
00:22:58,710 --> 00:23:01,540
-No, actually, it's not my--
-I'm just messing with you.

256
00:23:02,420 --> 00:23:05,090
"Greg. UN reporter", huh?

257
00:23:05,460 --> 00:23:06,970
Couldn't get a real job?

258
00:23:10,220 --> 00:23:12,180
Smooth. Smooth.

259
00:23:42,710 --> 00:23:43,790
Hey!

260
00:23:58,770 --> 00:24:01,600
You're a free spirit.
I don't know how you do it.

261
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:08,360
First, move from a society
that discourages individualism...

262
00:24:08,650 --> 00:24:12,570
...then move to a city
that embraces it, for three years.

263
00:24:12,950 --> 00:24:13,990
It's easy.

264
00:24:15,990 --> 00:24:18,660
-I'll take the first shift on the floor.
-Sure.

265
00:24:29,550 --> 00:24:32,970
A lot of American companies
would love unrestricted access to China.

266
00:24:33,050 --> 00:24:35,680
We see this as a major shift
in economic powers.

267
00:24:35,890 --> 00:24:40,560
There are two sides to consider,
particularly as the Chinese are concerned.

268
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:43,100
That sounds very prudent of you.

269
00:24:44,190 --> 00:24:46,020
The Ambassador's been here about a week.

270
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:41,250
We are on the air.

271
00:25:52,210 --> 00:25:54,130
He's complaining about the menu.

272
00:25:54,220 --> 00:25:57,970
Seems he's not a fan of Szechwan cuisine,
and somebody should have known that.

273
00:25:58,100 --> 00:26:00,930
What? He doesn't like
the pickled pig knuckles?

274
00:26:01,100 --> 00:26:02,100
No?

275
00:26:15,820 --> 00:26:17,620
Ladies and gentlemen...

276
00:26:17,700 --> 00:26:21,120
...thank you for your warm welcome
and your presence here this evening.

277
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:26,460
China, and the West, began their history
together not in war but in trade.

278
00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:31,550
It's trade that brings us all together tonight,
and it's trade that will bind us...

279
00:26:31,630 --> 00:26:33,920
...and unite us for years to come.

280
00:26:34,090 --> 00:26:36,680
This agreement brings to fruition...

281
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:39,680
...years of hard work
by leaders on both sides...

282
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:42,680
...driven by a belief
that economic prosperity...

283
00:26:42,770 --> 00:26:47,350
...will forge an era of peace
that the world has never enjoyed.

284
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:52,110
Marco Polo would be proud to know
that we go to the next level here.

285
00:26:57,860 --> 00:27:01,280
Open the door to the 21st century
and announce that, yes...

286
00:27:01,330 --> 00:27:06,960
...China wants to become a member of
the club that'll guide this planet's destiny...

287
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:09,080
...into the next 1000 years.

288
00:27:09,170 --> 00:27:11,500
With the signing of
the UN Trade Agreement...

289
00:27:11,540 --> 00:27:13,960
... 1.5 billion Chinese...

290
00:27:14,550 --> 00:27:16,840
...will have access to the world markets that will--

291
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:20,430
There will be no future reforms of trade
until there's accountability...

292
00:27:20,550 --> 00:27:22,010
...for criminal aggression!

293
00:27:22,100 --> 00:27:22,890
I'll check him out.

294
00:27:24,220 --> 00:27:25,680
I'm there already.

295
00:27:27,770 --> 00:27:31,610
Well, you make that 1.4999 billion.

296
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:38,650
Without any further delay, here he is,
the architect of China's future...

297
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:41,570
...Ambassador Jian Tze Wu.

298
00:27:49,540 --> 00:27:50,830
What's he saying to Chan?

299
00:27:55,460 --> 00:27:58,420
The level is too low,
and he's blocking the bug.

300
00:27:58,550 --> 00:27:59,630
Come on, I've got to know.

301
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:02,510
It's recording.
I'll clean the tape once we're done.

302
00:28:11,730 --> 00:28:16,730
"Today, I'm very happy
to participate in this party.

303
00:28:20,820 --> 00:28:22,660
"I'm honored...

304
00:28:22,740 --> 00:28:26,870
"...to open the door of China to the world."

305
00:28:57,190 --> 00:28:59,360
I'm out of the building. What's going on?

306
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:03,200
I got him. Light tracksuit. Bly?

307
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:04,370
Novak, get out of there!

308
00:29:04,780 --> 00:29:05,910
Copy. I'm gone.

309
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:08,790
Moving to the seventh floor.

310
00:29:08,910 --> 00:29:10,000
Anna!

311
00:29:13,620 --> 00:29:16,590
Help! Somebody help me!

312
00:29:28,060 --> 00:29:31,180
-Emergency exit. West side.
-Copy that. I'm mobile!

313
00:29:31,270 --> 00:29:33,060
-Cut him off outside.
-I'm on it.

314
00:29:46,820 --> 00:29:49,200
Parking structure! Ah, no you don't!

315
00:29:49,290 --> 00:29:52,330
I'm at street level. Moving to you.
Box that fucker.

316
00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:09,970
Stop!

317
00:30:42,300 --> 00:30:44,340
Check in. What's your situation?

318
00:30:45,220 --> 00:30:46,130
Shaw!

319
00:30:48,220 --> 00:30:49,180
Head outside!

320
00:30:50,890 --> 00:30:52,350
Shaw! Talk to me!

321
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:56,390
-Shaw, what's your situation?
-Shots fired.

322
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:00,610
Talk to me, Shaw!

323
00:31:01,270 --> 00:31:03,110
I'm on the east side, coming to you.

324
00:31:03,190 --> 00:31:05,610
Okay! East side. I'll be there!

325
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:10,870
He's hea- heading for the street.
You should have visual.

326
00:31:11,370 --> 00:31:13,160
Negative, no contact!

327
00:31:16,910 --> 00:31:17,870
I got him.

328
00:31:19,380 --> 00:31:20,840
-Where?
-Damn!

329
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:21,750
77th!

330
00:31:23,090 --> 00:31:25,010
Copy. 77th Street.

331
00:31:25,090 --> 00:31:26,220
Coming to you!

332
00:31:26,670 --> 00:31:27,800
I'm almost there!

333
00:31:27,930 --> 00:31:29,930
Okay, mid-block. Construction site.

334
00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:33,640
Location?

335
00:31:34,770 --> 00:31:36,430
-Location?
-76th.

336
00:31:42,110 --> 00:31:44,480
You got him?
He should be right in front of you.

337
00:31:44,780 --> 00:31:46,280
Negative, negative.

338
00:31:46,360 --> 00:31:47,780
-Bly!
-Wait, I got him.

339
00:31:47,860 --> 00:31:49,490
-I got him!
-I can't hear you.

340
00:31:49,570 --> 00:31:51,870
-I got the mark. I got him.
-Bly!

341
00:31:52,450 --> 00:31:54,950
Shaw, help me! I'm hit.

342
00:31:55,540 --> 00:31:57,290
-Shaw, I'm hit.
-Bly!

343
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,420
Bly! Oh, God!

344
00:32:03,290 --> 00:32:04,750
Bly, come in!

345
00:32:06,050 --> 00:32:07,090
Shit!

346
00:32:07,170 --> 00:32:08,840
Freeze! Drop your weapon!

347
00:32:11,390 --> 00:32:12,850
I said, drop your weapon!

348
00:32:12,930 --> 00:32:14,760
Drop it! Drop it now!

349
00:32:15,510 --> 00:32:16,600
Drop it now!

350
00:32:20,390 --> 00:32:23,690
Put your hands behind your head.
Hands behind your head!

351
00:32:24,730 --> 00:32:27,490
Get on your knees! On your knees!

352
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:38,500
Bly!

353
00:32:39,660 --> 00:32:40,660
Bly!

354
00:32:41,170 --> 00:32:42,080
Bly!

355
00:32:43,210 --> 00:32:44,500
Shaw, help me!

356
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:02,140
Let's go. Come on.

357
00:33:49,730 --> 00:33:51,690
Oh, I'm sorry. Sorry.

358
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:54,740
That's okay. You're Julia Fang, right?

359
00:33:56,820 --> 00:33:59,370
I'm Franklin Cappella,
Special Agent with the FBI.

360
00:34:01,370 --> 00:34:02,910
You mind if we chat?

361
00:34:05,830 --> 00:34:08,290
You're moved
to a five-star accommodation...

362
00:34:08,420 --> 00:34:10,250
...courtesy of the FBI.

363
00:34:11,340 --> 00:34:13,340
You've got the wrong man.

364
00:34:13,510 --> 00:34:15,470
How many jokers do you think we snatch...

365
00:34:15,550 --> 00:34:18,220
...sprinting along 76th Street
with a 9-millimeter?

366
00:34:18,350 --> 00:34:19,810
Including me?

367
00:34:20,140 --> 00:34:22,810
Maybe we should just hand you over
to the Chinese.

368
00:34:22,890 --> 00:34:24,890
Let them kung fu your ass.

369
00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:30,780
It's not him.

370
00:34:31,530 --> 00:34:33,860
Well, thank you very much, miss.

371
00:34:35,070 --> 00:34:38,070
We... We'll find you, if we need you.

372
00:35:05,230 --> 00:35:06,140
Ceramic gun?

373
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:09,610
Clears metal detector nicely.

374
00:35:11,730 --> 00:35:14,530
UN credentials. Too difficult to fake.

375
00:35:15,610 --> 00:35:19,490
High-tech communication gear,
almost government issue which means...

376
00:35:20,030 --> 00:35:24,870
...we shop at the same store, but only you
have a higher limit on your credit card...

377
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:27,870
...which makes sense for a...

378
00:35:28,870 --> 00:35:30,290
...CIA officer?

379
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:32,290
Army Intel?

380
00:35:32,380 --> 00:35:33,630
Foreign government?

381
00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:39,840
Just feel free to chime in at any point,
I'll just keep on talking.

382
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:45,100
The point is, Greg,
that we have dead Chinese refugees...

383
00:35:45,220 --> 00:35:47,440
...and we have a dead Chinese ambassador.

384
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:51,860
I don't need a fortune cookie to tell me
that someone wants to put the kibosh...

385
00:35:51,940 --> 00:35:53,690
...on the, what do you call it?

386
00:35:53,730 --> 00:35:56,360
The Chinese Trade Agreement type deal.

387
00:36:04,040 --> 00:36:05,370
What's going on?

388
00:36:09,830 --> 00:36:10,540
Go!

389
00:36:11,130 --> 00:36:12,040
Go! Go!

390
00:37:06,010 --> 00:37:10,060
Son of a bitch! Cock-sucking assholes!

391
00:37:12,230 --> 00:37:14,400
I'm too fucking old for this.

392
00:40:25,210 --> 00:40:26,630
Goddamn it! Shit!

393
00:41:02,120 --> 00:41:05,420
Tensions flared with news
of the Ambassador's assassination.

394
00:41:05,540 --> 00:41:09,300
Meanwhile, in an unusual move,
the FBI's withholding the identity...

395
00:41:09,340 --> 00:41:13,340
...of the assassin who fled captivity
last night in a daring escape.

396
00:41:14,550 --> 00:41:15,850
You check your e-mail?

397
00:41:15,930 --> 00:41:17,430
I'll have to call you back.

398
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:20,140
-Give me the phone.
-Is everything all right?

399
00:41:20,230 --> 00:41:21,140
Listen.

400
00:41:22,730 --> 00:41:24,150
Transfer the call.

401
00:41:28,030 --> 00:41:29,360
We're both here now.

402
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:32,990
The UN is running a secret unit
that assassinated China's Ambassador...

403
00:41:33,070 --> 00:41:34,530
...to the United Nations.

404
00:41:36,700 --> 00:41:40,450
This will be the news story of the week,
and will damage the UN permanently.

405
00:41:40,540 --> 00:41:41,580
Unless?

406
00:41:41,660 --> 00:41:44,330
Unless the Chinese Trade Agreement
dies on the table.

407
00:41:44,630 --> 00:41:48,130
We don't have the power to kill it.
Others do. We don't.

408
00:41:48,250 --> 00:41:50,010
Nevertheless, you have 24 hours.

409
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:54,680
Kill the treaty. Why?

410
00:41:56,970 --> 00:41:59,220
Who stands to gain by that?

411
00:42:07,150 --> 00:42:08,900
It's the way we would've done it.

412
00:42:08,980 --> 00:42:10,480
What are you talking about?

413
00:42:10,940 --> 00:42:12,110
The blackmail.

414
00:42:12,860 --> 00:42:15,240
Our own techniques being used against us.

415
00:42:16,030 --> 00:42:17,120
Your techniques, Eleanor.

416
00:42:18,030 --> 00:42:20,200
I told you this would come back
to haunt us.

417
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:23,120
There is no free lunch.
You have to pay the piper.

418
00:42:23,330 --> 00:42:26,170
Now, I want everything to stop immediately.

419
00:42:26,920 --> 00:42:28,750
I don't want anything to happen...

420
00:42:28,790 --> 00:42:31,340
...without my consultation
and my permission.

421
00:42:31,420 --> 00:42:34,260
-Mr. Secretary, I must insist--
-No-no-no, you- you listen to me, Eleanor.

422
00:42:36,840 --> 00:42:38,220
Who is this man?

423
00:42:40,140 --> 00:42:42,390
The assassination
of Chinese Ambassador Wu...

424
00:42:42,430 --> 00:42:45,600
...could not have come at a worse time
for U.S.-China relations.

425
00:42:45,770 --> 00:42:48,900
UN representatives have expressed concern
that the incident could delay...

426
00:42:48,940 --> 00:42:50,610
...the Chinese Trade Agreement.

427
00:42:50,690 --> 00:42:54,780
But others fear more permanent damage
to relations between the two countries.

428
00:42:54,860 --> 00:42:58,030
Businessman David Chan is recovering
at a downtown hospital.

429
00:42:58,120 --> 00:43:00,620
His doctors made a brief statement
a few hours ago.

430
00:43:00,660 --> 00:43:03,000
Mr. Chan is resting comfortably.

431
00:43:04,250 --> 00:43:07,880
The bullet was removed from his arm
without complication.

432
00:43:53,420 --> 00:43:54,340
Wagner?

433
00:44:02,560 --> 00:44:03,560
Hey, baby.

434
00:44:08,440 --> 00:44:10,560
I think you got something for me.

435
00:44:45,640 --> 00:44:47,850
Same caliber that took out
Ambassador Wu.

436
00:44:48,060 --> 00:44:50,230
I'm sure Greg Brogan's prints are on it.

437
00:44:51,400 --> 00:44:55,650
So our boy gets rescued
by these Triad assholes...

438
00:44:56,820 --> 00:45:01,740
...punctures one of them in the melon,
and renders the others into Chinese salsa.

439
00:45:09,790 --> 00:45:11,870
-Do you ever watch wrestling, Ray?
-Sure.

440
00:45:12,460 --> 00:45:14,210
I mean, you know, now and then.

441
00:45:14,340 --> 00:45:16,210
Because this is just like wrestling.

442
00:45:16,250 --> 00:45:17,050
How?

443
00:45:17,130 --> 00:45:20,380
Well, it's reality mixed with illusion,
mixed with bullshit, mixed with...

444
00:45:20,420 --> 00:45:24,970
...big scary guys from parts unknown
in dire need of psychiatric care.

445
00:48:12,510 --> 00:48:14,140
Have it your way.

446
00:49:09,610 --> 00:49:10,610
Thank you.

447
00:49:14,870 --> 00:49:16,080
Now.

448
00:50:36,910 --> 00:50:39,660
The level is too low,
and he's blocking the bug.

449
00:50:42,750 --> 00:50:44,790
It's good to see you, too.

450
00:51:16,320 --> 00:51:19,950
Miss Fang, why is it that police still believe the man
you saw is the killer when you said he was not?

451
00:51:20,370 --> 00:51:23,790
Would you comment on rumors linking you
with the suspect romantically?

452
00:51:44,480 --> 00:51:47,520
Oh, Miss Fang? May I have a word with you?

453
00:51:47,690 --> 00:51:50,230
No. Don't you have a certain fugitive
to apprehend?

454
00:51:50,310 --> 00:51:52,270
No-no-no. I just want to talk to you
for a second.

455
00:51:54,320 --> 00:51:55,530
This is harassment.

456
00:51:55,610 --> 00:51:57,610
I'm just trying to protect you, ma'am.

457
00:51:57,700 --> 00:51:58,450
From who?

458
00:52:01,700 --> 00:52:04,160
Our... fugitive friend is mixed up
with the Triads.

459
00:52:04,250 --> 00:52:05,710
You know what that means.

460
00:52:06,500 --> 00:52:08,710
My best friend is dying up there.

461
00:52:08,790 --> 00:52:12,500
If you want to help, find the person
who tried to choke the life out of her.

462
00:52:13,170 --> 00:52:14,260
Okay.

463
00:52:15,380 --> 00:52:17,470
If you want to call me, there's my card.

464
00:52:18,880 --> 00:52:19,590
Fuck!

465
00:52:52,380 --> 00:52:55,000
Help! Somebody help me!

466
00:54:41,690 --> 00:54:42,860
Go, girl. Go.

467
00:54:49,540 --> 00:54:51,000
Go. Come on.

468
00:54:52,080 --> 00:54:52,960
In the car.

469
00:54:57,290 --> 00:54:58,630
Move over.

470
00:55:19,400 --> 00:55:21,400
Not a word.

471
00:55:43,380 --> 00:55:44,380
Move on.

472
00:55:46,340 --> 00:55:47,680
Not a word.

473
00:56:52,950 --> 00:56:54,580
Who do you work for?

474
00:56:57,410 --> 00:56:58,620
Who do you work for?

475
00:57:01,880 --> 00:57:03,880
Are we just going to sit here!

476
00:57:11,590 --> 00:57:13,260
Please, stop that.

477
00:57:14,350 --> 00:57:15,220
No.

478
00:57:18,020 --> 00:57:18,730
No?

479
00:57:22,730 --> 00:57:24,270
I've got you figured out.

480
00:57:24,570 --> 00:57:25,480
Oh, you do, huh?

481
00:57:25,820 --> 00:57:28,150
You think I don't see that
you're as scared as I am?

482
00:57:28,240 --> 00:57:31,450
That the only reason you won't tell me what
the fuck is going on is that you don't know yourself.

483
00:57:31,530 --> 00:57:32,910
Okay, all right. That's enough.

484
00:57:33,030 --> 00:57:33,740
Okay?

485
00:57:35,030 --> 00:57:36,040
All right?

486
00:57:44,960 --> 00:57:47,210
So, what are you?
Some kind of government agent?

487
00:57:49,380 --> 00:57:51,470
Translate this for me and you go free.

488
00:57:52,550 --> 00:57:53,470
Free?

489
00:57:54,390 --> 00:57:55,680
Free to go where?

490
00:58:00,180 --> 00:58:02,650
All right. Play it again.

491
00:58:06,980 --> 00:58:08,690
This is Ambassador Wu.

492
00:58:08,900 --> 00:58:09,990
Yes.

493
00:58:13,700 --> 00:58:16,330
He's saying that the dead refugees...

494
00:58:16,530 --> 00:58:18,620
...were a deliberate action...

495
00:58:19,540 --> 00:58:21,410
...to derail the trade agreement.

496
00:58:22,580 --> 00:58:24,830
And he knows who is responsible.

497
00:58:26,340 --> 00:58:27,960
Who's he talking to?

498
00:58:29,460 --> 00:58:32,090
He got here too late.
She was already dead.

499
00:58:32,800 --> 00:58:35,050
So he took it out on a Triad stiff.

500
00:58:37,390 --> 00:58:38,850
Jana Novak.

501
00:58:40,060 --> 00:58:41,640
Her passport is Czech.

502
00:58:44,900 --> 00:58:46,480
Her file came up blank.

503
00:58:46,560 --> 00:58:48,230
Same as our guy. Same dead end.

504
00:58:48,440 --> 00:58:49,980
Weird same.

505
00:58:50,070 --> 00:58:51,240
Weird.

506
00:58:53,150 --> 00:58:55,070
Phone records you asked for.

507
00:58:56,280 --> 00:58:58,530
There's definitely a pattern
showing up here.

508
00:58:58,580 --> 00:59:01,250
You mean other than
half a dozen dead bodies?

509
00:59:01,790 --> 00:59:04,870
Well yeah, look. Phone numbers in sequence:

510
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:07,080
555-3901.

511
00:59:07,210 --> 00:59:09,920
-555-3902, 555--
-Okay, let's see.

512
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:13,420
What you've got to do is,
you've got to go all the way up to 99.

513
00:59:14,260 --> 00:59:16,090
Isolate the possibles...

514
00:59:16,140 --> 00:59:19,180
...stake out all the locations,
wait for our guy to show up.

515
00:59:19,260 --> 00:59:20,470
Bob's your uncle.

516
00:59:20,560 --> 00:59:22,730
That's a good plan but, who's Bob?

517
00:59:24,270 --> 00:59:25,850
He's your uncle.

518
00:59:56,260 --> 00:59:58,090
This better be a fucking emergency.

519
00:59:58,510 --> 01:00:00,260
Hello? Who is this?

520
01:00:12,610 --> 01:00:15,150
We are unable to complete your call
as dialed.

521
01:00:15,240 --> 01:00:17,490
Please check the number and dial again.

522
01:00:17,530 --> 01:00:21,490
Protests like this one at the U.S. Embassy
in Beijing are causing many to believe...

523
01:00:21,580 --> 01:00:24,870
...that the UN Trade Agreement
will dissolve before it ever starts.

524
01:00:25,620 --> 01:00:28,120
And all eyes are on
Secretary-General Douglas Thomas...

525
01:00:28,210 --> 01:00:32,290
...to find a peaceful solution to the strained
relations between the countries.

526
01:00:41,260 --> 01:00:44,970
You have a monumental crisis emerging,
Mr. Secretary-General.

527
01:00:45,060 --> 01:00:47,810
I'm convinced that there's only one man
in the whole world...

528
01:00:47,890 --> 01:00:52,520
...who can compel those fellows in Beijing
to stick with their agreement.

529
01:00:53,070 --> 01:00:54,980
And that man is you, David.

530
01:01:01,070 --> 01:01:05,040
I don't know if you're trying to flatter me
or frighten me, sir.

531
01:01:05,700 --> 01:01:08,410
I think what the Secretary-General
is suggesting...

532
01:01:08,500 --> 01:01:12,540
...is that you can remind all parties
involved that, as history has shown...

533
01:01:12,630 --> 01:01:15,670
...economic prosperity does wonders
at keeping the peace.

534
01:01:16,050 --> 01:01:18,590
Excuse me, Madam Hooks,
I missed CNN today.

535
01:01:18,670 --> 01:01:20,840
Is there a war going on
that I'm unaware of?.

536
01:01:20,890 --> 01:01:22,680
There's always a war going on, David.

537
01:01:22,760 --> 01:01:24,640
There's your side, there's their side...

538
01:01:24,720 --> 01:01:27,680
...and there's me stuck in the middle
trying to make it look like peace.

539
01:01:27,810 --> 01:01:30,730
The Secretary-General spoke
to the President this morning.

540
01:01:30,900 --> 01:01:33,060
And, if the situation does not improve...

541
01:01:33,110 --> 01:01:35,690
...he's prepared to fly in
from Washington tomorrow...

542
01:01:35,730 --> 01:01:39,490
...and attend the ceremony himself,
as a show of support for the agreement.

543
01:01:40,030 --> 01:01:41,490
It's a last resort.

544
01:01:41,610 --> 01:01:46,040
I- I don't want it to happen. I want this to be
a United Nations' initiative.

545
01:01:46,080 --> 01:01:48,580
But, more than anything else,
I want it to work...

546
01:01:48,660 --> 01:01:51,040
...and I'm afraid that, as things stand now...

547
01:01:51,540 --> 01:01:54,040
...without the President's presence,
it can't work.

548
01:01:56,670 --> 01:02:00,090
Don't bring in the President.
It'll only complicate things.

549
01:02:00,220 --> 01:02:02,050
And in the meantime, we were hoping...

550
01:02:02,130 --> 01:02:05,100
...that you wouldn't mind acting
as interim diplomat.

551
01:02:06,600 --> 01:02:09,350
An ambassador of good will, if you will.

552
01:02:10,140 --> 01:02:11,600
I'd be honored to help...

553
01:02:13,940 --> 01:02:16,320
...and allow you to take the headlines:

554
01:02:17,230 --> 01:02:20,150
"Secretary-General saves
China Trade Agreement."

555
01:02:22,660 --> 01:02:23,610
Excuse me.

556
01:02:27,660 --> 01:02:28,700
Eleanor Hooks.

557
01:02:28,790 --> 01:02:30,540
You posted a missing cat?

558
01:02:33,920 --> 01:02:34,920
Yes.

559
01:02:35,960 --> 01:02:37,290
Yes, I did.

560
01:02:38,170 --> 01:02:39,460
You found him healthy?

561
01:02:39,590 --> 01:02:40,670
Yes.

562
01:02:42,550 --> 01:02:45,680
You'll need to keep him for a few days.
Is that a problem?

563
01:02:46,260 --> 01:02:47,640
No problem.

564
01:02:48,010 --> 01:02:49,810
I know where to reach you.

565
01:03:04,240 --> 01:03:06,280
-Asshole!
-Get a house, you jerk!

566
01:03:19,250 --> 01:03:21,800
Internet chat rooms,
though they're a free-for-all...

567
01:03:22,260 --> 01:03:24,260
...you just have to know where to go.

568
01:03:28,850 --> 01:03:31,100
"Triads killed Wu."

569
01:03:31,350 --> 01:03:33,020
"Framed me."

570
01:03:34,270 --> 01:03:36,940
"Possible mole in department."

571
01:03:37,770 --> 01:03:42,650
"Hold communications and expect cover..."

572
01:03:43,280 --> 01:03:45,530
"...to be compromised..."

573
01:03:46,450 --> 01:03:48,990
"...within 24 hours."

574
01:03:50,330 --> 01:03:51,620
"Stay under radar."

575
01:03:52,240 --> 01:03:53,200
"Good luck."

576
01:03:53,910 --> 01:03:55,870
Yeah, good luck.

577
01:03:58,420 --> 01:04:00,210
You work for the UN, don't you?

578
01:04:02,130 --> 01:04:03,510
Jesus, you do.

579
01:04:04,260 --> 01:04:08,340
OK, I want you to go in there and buy
some bottled water and some food that we'll keep.

580
01:04:09,350 --> 01:04:12,010
And when you come out, there's one more thing
that I want you to do for me.

581
01:04:12,100 --> 01:04:13,140
One more thing?

582
01:04:13,220 --> 01:04:16,440
It must be nice for you to assume
I will bend over whenever you please.

583
01:04:17,140 --> 01:04:19,190
-It's--
-It's bend over backwards.

584
01:04:19,270 --> 01:04:20,770
...what I meant.

585
01:04:21,440 --> 01:04:22,780
Thank you.

586
01:04:24,320 --> 01:04:25,610
I'm trusting you.

587
01:04:44,800 --> 01:04:47,680
I really don't care nothing about it
that you're drunk!

588
01:04:47,800 --> 01:04:50,640
But you better cook that food
like it's supposed to though.

589
01:04:50,720 --> 01:04:51,550
Excuse me.

590
01:04:54,390 --> 01:04:56,480
-Hello?
-Is a Ma- Marie there?

591
01:04:56,560 --> 01:04:59,730
-No Marie here.
-Oh, sorry, sorry, wrong number.

592
01:05:00,770 --> 01:05:01,940
Pay phone?

593
01:05:02,020 --> 01:05:03,020
Over....

594
01:05:03,480 --> 01:05:05,230
I am not through with you!

595
01:05:19,250 --> 01:05:21,420
I keep telling you, don't nobody want--

596
01:05:21,580 --> 01:05:22,960
Get over there!

597
01:05:29,430 --> 01:05:30,550
Hi, Lo Kee Bakery.

598
01:05:31,140 --> 01:05:32,300
Bingo.

599
01:05:38,280 --> 01:05:39,440
Oh, great.

600
01:06:38,290 --> 01:06:39,040
Down!

601
01:06:40,040 --> 01:06:41,160
Everybody down!

602
01:07:02,020 --> 01:07:03,810
-Get undressed.
-Excuse me?

603
01:07:03,890 --> 01:07:06,150
Strip. All your clothes off, now.

604
01:07:06,230 --> 01:07:08,730
-You think I'm--
-Now! Take your clothes off, now!

605
01:07:09,030 --> 01:07:10,940
Oh, you think I'm gonna get undressed for you?

606
01:07:11,030 --> 01:07:14,240
You're bugged. There's a transmitter
in your clothing somewhere.

607
01:07:14,360 --> 01:07:16,370
-A transmitter? How?
-I don't know how.

608
01:07:16,490 --> 01:07:20,040
How do you think they tracked us
to the diner, huh? JUst think about it.

609
01:07:20,580 --> 01:07:23,210
They went after you in there. Not me.

610
01:07:23,410 --> 01:07:24,370
Take 'em off.

611
01:07:42,810 --> 01:07:43,810
What was that?

612
01:07:43,890 --> 01:07:45,640
You said I was free to go.

613
01:07:46,940 --> 01:07:48,400
Oh, you wanna go?

614
01:07:48,520 --> 01:07:49,610
Okay.

615
01:07:54,990 --> 01:07:56,110
Here.

616
01:07:56,160 --> 01:07:57,200
Go.

617
01:07:58,660 --> 01:07:59,870
See ya.

618
01:08:04,750 --> 01:08:06,120
Thought so.

619
01:08:06,580 --> 01:08:07,460
Glasses.

620
01:08:07,630 --> 01:08:08,790
Watch.

621
01:08:28,150 --> 01:08:29,520
Best I could do.

622
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:48,750
You're not used to this, are you?

623
01:08:58,970 --> 01:09:02,430
Not having control of the situation,
being manipulated.

624
01:09:04,890 --> 01:09:07,350
You're normally on the other side
of the equation.

625
01:09:07,390 --> 01:09:10,400
What, are you just stating the obvious
for your own personal enjoyment...

626
01:09:10,480 --> 01:09:12,820
...or you... you moonlighting
as a psychic friend?

627
01:09:13,940 --> 01:09:16,570
If I help you,
it would follow that I help myself.

628
01:09:16,740 --> 01:09:20,410
Okay. Well then, help yourself
by telling me about Ambassador Wu.

629
01:09:20,870 --> 01:09:23,080
You said you worked for him
for a long time.

630
01:09:28,460 --> 01:09:30,250
Ambassador Wu was an outsider.

631
01:09:30,330 --> 01:09:33,210
He knew China's future lay
in economic growth.

632
01:09:34,590 --> 01:09:37,880
But the party line was to keep
a separation with the West.

633
01:09:39,010 --> 01:09:41,180
He believed that the gulf could be crossed.

634
01:09:41,720 --> 01:09:42,680
What gulf?

635
01:09:43,720 --> 01:09:46,520
I'm talking about appearances
and meaning.

636
01:09:48,230 --> 01:09:51,480
Frankly, I thought you'd be more sensitive
to this concept.

637
01:10:03,910 --> 01:10:05,280
Who are you calling?

638
01:10:05,330 --> 01:10:06,540
You tell me.

639
01:10:07,160 --> 01:10:08,410
Lo Kee Bakery.

640
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:12,080
Okay, it's a front.

641
01:10:13,670 --> 01:10:14,590
For what?

642
01:10:14,630 --> 01:10:17,250
This is an athletic club.

643
01:10:20,720 --> 01:10:23,720
A private gentleman's club
for gambling and....

644
01:10:23,930 --> 01:10:24,970
And?

645
01:10:26,640 --> 01:10:27,890
And sex.

646
01:10:36,900 --> 01:10:37,780
You're late!

647
01:10:41,650 --> 01:10:44,450
Hey, where's one of the moron brothers?
C'mon, where are you guys?

648
01:10:44,570 --> 01:10:46,450
Frank, my clients are waiting.

649
01:10:52,670 --> 01:10:55,210
You'll be able to hear me with this.

650
01:11:07,930 --> 01:11:10,140
And you'll be able to talk to me...

651
01:11:11,890 --> 01:11:13,140
...with this.

652
01:11:18,400 --> 01:11:20,030
I need your help.

653
01:11:20,110 --> 01:11:22,320
Help me find what I'm looking for, okay?

654
01:11:25,320 --> 01:11:28,160
-What are you doing?
-I don't have time to worry about another thing, okay?

655
01:11:28,200 --> 01:11:31,700
-Where would I go?
-I don't know. Some place I obviously haven't thought of.

656
01:11:46,470 --> 01:11:49,640
Can you tell me why my helping you
is conditional on being a prisoner.

657
01:11:49,760 --> 01:11:51,100
You're not a prisoner.

658
01:11:51,180 --> 01:11:53,730
I'm protecting you. From yourself.

659
01:13:20,900 --> 01:13:24,400
One of these days, you're gonna have to tell me
how you know about this place.

660
01:13:28,900 --> 01:13:29,780
Julia?

661
01:13:32,600 --> 01:13:33,680
Julia?

662
01:13:34,120 --> 01:13:35,120
You awake?

663
01:13:35,450 --> 01:13:36,790
I'm awake.

664
01:13:38,540 --> 01:13:40,620
I was just in a different place.

665
01:13:41,830 --> 01:13:43,420
Can we stick to the present?

666
01:13:43,500 --> 01:13:46,840
You know, I read a book once
about these prisoners of war...

667
01:13:47,380 --> 01:13:50,220
...who construct the house of their dreams
in their head...

668
01:13:50,470 --> 01:13:52,010
...to keep their sanity.

669
01:13:52,140 --> 01:13:53,350
Sanity?

670
01:13:53,760 --> 01:13:55,850
I thought you lost that a long time ago.

671
01:13:56,470 --> 01:14:00,940
Right now I'm sitting at a cafe,
in a small village...

672
01:14:02,730 --> 01:14:04,270
...in the south of France.

673
01:14:10,070 --> 01:14:12,280
There's a familiar face.

674
01:14:16,790 --> 01:14:18,620
Shaw, there's cops pulling up everywhere.

675
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:28,460
Did you hear what I said?

676
01:14:30,260 --> 01:14:31,090
Yeah.

677
01:14:31,590 --> 01:14:32,720
Party's over.

678
01:15:53,300 --> 01:15:55,760
Did you need any help with those?

679
01:15:58,970 --> 01:16:00,470
We have a full license.

680
01:16:00,640 --> 01:16:04,520
Oh, you've got a fucking license?
We'll just be on our way then.

681
01:16:04,890 --> 01:16:07,150
You're in way over your head, boy.

682
01:16:07,230 --> 01:16:09,480
You see, we have an understanding with the police.

683
01:16:09,570 --> 01:16:12,940
Well, now you have an understanding
with the FBI.

684
01:16:16,450 --> 01:16:18,280
I said assume the fucking position.

685
01:16:18,410 --> 01:16:20,620
-Assume position.
-I'm not going anywhere.

686
01:16:20,740 --> 01:16:24,000
You kung fu motherfucker!
Didn't you hear that officer talk to you?

687
01:16:24,080 --> 01:16:26,790
What's wrong with you? Get over here.
Give me those.

688
01:16:26,960 --> 01:16:29,420
Get up the stairs with your bitch ass.

689
01:16:32,590 --> 01:16:35,260
Let's get their names.
Get them out of here. Come on.

690
01:16:36,380 --> 01:16:40,350
You know, sometimes it's hard to tell the
difference between the good guys and the bad guys.

691
01:16:40,430 --> 01:16:41,850
It's not always obvious--

692
01:16:42,350 --> 01:16:44,600
Excuse me, miss.
Is this man bothering you?

693
01:16:44,680 --> 01:16:46,350
Steel. Left hand.

694
01:16:46,480 --> 01:16:47,560
Nice and slow.

695
01:16:47,650 --> 01:16:48,650
All right.

696
01:16:48,730 --> 01:16:49,810
Step back.

697
01:16:50,150 --> 01:16:52,610
Not exactly FBI waist regulation, is it?

698
01:16:53,110 --> 01:16:54,740
I'm on probation.

699
01:16:56,610 --> 01:16:58,910
Okay, Cappella, why don't you ask her.

700
01:16:59,450 --> 01:17:02,740
Ask her who the bad guys are,
and if she wants to walk away with you.

701
01:17:05,710 --> 01:17:09,000
Look, we're both after the same thing.
Why can't we work together on this?

702
01:17:09,540 --> 01:17:12,550
Because your idea of cooperation
is me in a cell.

703
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:14,710
I don't particularly like that.

704
01:17:17,220 --> 01:17:18,720
I'm just after the truth.

705
01:17:19,550 --> 01:17:23,260
Well, why don't you check out the Vietnamese
refugees underneath the bakery?

706
01:17:23,390 --> 01:17:27,140
My guess is they're linked to the dead ones
you found in the container.

707
01:17:27,350 --> 01:17:28,480
You can be a hero.

708
01:17:30,860 --> 01:17:33,730
I don't think there's a weight requirement
for Attorney General, do you?

709
01:17:33,820 --> 01:17:34,570
Probably not.

710
01:17:35,320 --> 01:17:36,440
Probably not?

711
01:17:37,610 --> 01:17:38,450
Oh, Cappella?

712
01:17:38,950 --> 01:17:39,700
Yeah?

713
01:17:43,240 --> 01:17:44,040
Thank you.

714
01:17:53,540 --> 01:17:55,300
That club stinks of David Chan.

715
01:17:55,420 --> 01:17:58,630
He's in bed with the Triads
and definitely linked to the refugees.

716
01:17:58,760 --> 01:18:02,350
But I need proof that he took out Wu
to kill the trade agreement.

717
01:18:02,470 --> 01:18:04,260
I'm not so sure about your theory.

718
01:18:04,350 --> 01:18:07,100
I mean, David Chan was supporting
the trade initiative.

719
01:18:07,310 --> 01:18:08,680
Appeared to be.

720
01:18:08,890 --> 01:18:10,560
But ask yourself this:

721
01:18:10,600 --> 01:18:12,650
Who benefits the most from Wu's death?

722
01:18:12,730 --> 01:18:14,020
Besides Mrs. Wu?

723
01:18:14,650 --> 01:18:18,690
If the trade agreement is signed tomorrow,
then Chan's business monopoly would be over.

724
01:18:18,740 --> 01:18:21,200
He'd have to compete
with the Western companies.

725
01:18:21,280 --> 01:18:23,740
Kill Wu and the UN Trade Agreement
with him...

726
01:18:23,780 --> 01:18:25,910
...Chan keeps China to himself.

727
01:18:27,450 --> 01:18:28,830
You make a lot of sense...

728
01:18:29,410 --> 01:18:30,750
...for a car thief.

729
01:18:31,420 --> 01:18:32,790
Okay, just relax.

730
01:18:34,420 --> 01:18:35,750
Okay, ready.

731
01:18:36,420 --> 01:18:40,300
You're gonna log on to the main Web site,
then you're gonna follow the instructions I gave you.

732
01:18:48,140 --> 01:18:49,640
Wait, the access is denied.

733
01:18:49,770 --> 01:18:53,730
Okay, simultaneously press
Control, Alternate, F8, twice.

734
01:18:54,310 --> 01:18:55,650
Backslash.

735
01:18:56,190 --> 01:18:56,980
Enter.

736
01:18:58,980 --> 01:19:00,360
Password and log in ID.

737
01:19:00,440 --> 01:19:02,110
Don't worry about it. You don't need it.

738
01:19:02,200 --> 01:19:04,570
Just follow the last lines of codes
on the page.

739
01:19:06,990 --> 01:19:08,660
Department of Defense?

740
01:19:09,250 --> 01:19:11,960
-Julia, look--
-Don't tell me. I don't want to know.

741
01:19:12,210 --> 01:19:15,250
It's just another trick I picked up
from some friends I used to train with.

742
01:19:15,330 --> 01:19:18,920
Did they train you to be this vague?
Or is it a gift?

743
01:19:18,960 --> 01:19:20,550
And what's that supposed to mean?

744
01:19:20,800 --> 01:19:22,430
You know what I mean.

745
01:19:22,470 --> 01:19:23,970
I mean your evasiveness.

746
01:19:24,470 --> 01:19:26,010
Comes with the territory.

747
01:19:26,100 --> 01:19:31,060
Well, the strong, silent-type cliche thing
is becoming tiresome.

748
01:19:34,600 --> 01:19:35,690
Okay, we're in.

749
01:19:41,360 --> 01:19:42,320
Okay.

750
01:19:45,160 --> 01:19:47,120
-Wait a minute. Wait, stop.
-What?

751
01:19:47,450 --> 01:19:48,240
Rewind.

752
01:19:52,120 --> 01:19:53,160
Play it again.

753
01:19:56,920 --> 01:20:00,670
All right, let's go frame by frame.
And look very carefully.

754
01:20:02,170 --> 01:20:04,630
Chan's looking before the shot was fired.

755
01:20:09,760 --> 01:20:11,970
I don't believe it. He knew.

756
01:20:12,020 --> 01:20:13,520
He knew that it was coming?

757
01:20:14,850 --> 01:20:16,520
More like, he made it happen.

758
01:20:17,060 --> 01:20:19,400
All right, make a copy
and get back to the car.

759
01:20:22,190 --> 01:20:24,150
Twenty-four hours are nearly up.

760
01:20:27,160 --> 01:20:29,660
I'm putting the trade deal
in the President's hands.

761
01:20:29,740 --> 01:20:31,660
I'm gonna let him run with it.

762
01:20:32,580 --> 01:20:36,750
Bringing the President in, sir,
seriously undermines your authority.

763
01:20:37,330 --> 01:20:40,460
Your strength is what will keep
the UN strong.

764
01:20:41,840 --> 01:20:43,340
I'm using all my sources.

765
01:20:43,460 --> 01:20:46,090
If anything should leak out, I can kill it.

766
01:20:46,880 --> 01:20:51,010
I feel certain you can keep
this deal together and avoid a scandal.

767
01:20:56,480 --> 01:20:57,770
Thank you, Eleanor.

768
01:20:58,900 --> 01:21:00,230
Thank you, but no.

769
01:21:02,110 --> 01:21:04,860
Reports are coming in that
Secretary-General Douglas Thomas...

770
01:21:04,940 --> 01:21:07,660
...has asked the President of the United States
to intervene...

771
01:21:07,740 --> 01:21:10,830
...and solidify the Chinese Trade Agreement
before it collapses.

772
01:21:10,910 --> 01:21:14,540
The President and the Secretary-General
will address the General Assembly tomorrow...

773
01:21:14,580 --> 01:21:17,330
...and attend the signing ceremony
at the UN.

774
01:21:17,420 --> 01:21:21,290
If Chan's serious about killing this deal,
that's where he'll make his next move.

775
01:21:22,040 --> 01:21:22,960
All right.

776
01:21:23,050 --> 01:21:27,340
I want you to take the videotape
and Wu's recording to Eleanor Hooks.

777
01:21:27,430 --> 01:21:30,430
She'll be able to get it to the right people
without bringing me into it.

778
01:21:30,510 --> 01:21:32,970
Meanwhile,
I'll provide the final piece of this puzzle.

779
01:21:33,060 --> 01:21:34,600
Finish this once and for all.

780
01:21:34,680 --> 01:21:37,020
-Where are you going?
-The last place I should.

781
01:21:43,320 --> 01:21:44,530
Yes, I will.

782
01:21:44,610 --> 01:21:47,990
I'm sorry. Miss Hooks is quite busy.
I hope you don't mind waiting.

783
01:22:46,500 --> 01:22:47,880
Happy New Year.

784
01:22:58,680 --> 01:22:59,770
Yeah.

785
01:23:02,520 --> 01:23:04,110
She's ready to see you now.

786
01:23:05,730 --> 01:23:08,610
Do you always exhibit such flair
at entrances and exits...

787
01:23:08,730 --> 01:23:11,490
...or is it just when visiting my hotels,
Mr. Shaw?

788
01:23:11,990 --> 01:23:14,370
Well, actually, I find them rather inviting.

789
01:23:14,870 --> 01:23:16,780
Kind of like a second home, you know?

790
01:23:16,870 --> 01:23:19,870
As my most effective asset in the field...

791
01:23:19,950 --> 01:23:22,920
...I'm almost embarrassed
that you're not on my payroll.

792
01:23:24,420 --> 01:23:27,250
Then maybe you'd like to make me
an offer I can't refuse.

793
01:23:27,800 --> 01:23:28,710
I would.

794
01:23:29,010 --> 01:23:32,170
But I'm afraid you would never get
to enjoy the rewards.

795
01:23:34,180 --> 01:23:35,720
Well, I guess this is my reward.

796
01:23:39,930 --> 01:23:41,680
Excellent, actually.

797
01:23:42,020 --> 01:23:44,190
Assassinate the man
who's been tracking you.

798
01:23:44,480 --> 01:23:46,770
And at the same time,
blow apart the trade agreement...

799
01:23:46,900 --> 01:23:48,270
...that could cost you billions.

800
01:23:48,730 --> 01:23:50,860
I know that nothing is what it seems.

801
01:23:51,150 --> 01:23:53,400
But I'm dying for you to explain this.

802
01:24:22,060 --> 01:24:24,020
If this information were to get out...

803
01:24:25,440 --> 01:24:30,320
...the scandal could seriously damage
China's credibility on the world stage.

804
01:24:30,480 --> 01:24:32,150
Do more harm than good.

805
01:24:34,110 --> 01:24:35,490
I never thought of that.

806
01:24:35,820 --> 01:24:40,990
Appearances are everything, Miss Fang.
Politics and deception are built on it.

807
01:25:58,530 --> 01:25:59,820
Head for the street!

808
01:26:01,240 --> 01:26:02,120
I got him!

809
01:26:02,200 --> 01:26:03,830
Okay, mid-block. Construction site.

810
01:26:25,930 --> 01:26:26,680
Location?

811
01:27:01,200 --> 01:27:01,920
Bly!

812
01:27:03,090 --> 01:27:03,720
Bly!

813
01:27:20,400 --> 01:27:21,900
Freeze! Drop your weapon!

814
01:27:22,610 --> 01:27:25,990
I said, drop your weapon! Drop it!

815
01:28:12,750 --> 01:28:13,960
That should do it.

816
01:28:22,170 --> 01:28:22,920
Come on!

817
01:28:23,670 --> 01:28:25,010
You're gonna need some silk.

818
01:28:35,560 --> 01:28:36,560
Are you all right?

819
01:28:39,190 --> 01:28:42,150
How does it feel to be a puppet
without the strings?

820
01:29:12,390 --> 01:29:17,190
The Art of War teaches:
Win by destroying your enemy from within.

821
01:29:17,730 --> 01:29:18,900
Ironic, isn't it...

822
01:29:18,980 --> 01:29:23,980
...that a 2000-year-old strategy would be
turned against the very people who created it?

823
01:29:26,110 --> 01:29:29,200
Better us doing it to them,
than them doing it to us.

824
01:29:30,620 --> 01:29:32,410
What are you talking about?

825
01:29:33,330 --> 01:29:37,960
I'm talking about 20 years of China fucking
America from within and nobody noticing.

826
01:29:38,790 --> 01:29:40,290
Well now they're going to notice.

827
01:29:44,710 --> 01:29:45,670
You.

828
01:29:47,010 --> 01:29:48,760
You're behind all this.

829
01:29:50,590 --> 01:29:54,310
With just enough help from David Chan
to keep everyone guessing.

830
01:29:54,470 --> 01:29:56,480
David Chan, most of all.

831
01:29:56,930 --> 01:29:58,640
I don't understand.

832
01:29:59,310 --> 01:30:01,480
Of course you don't, my dear...

833
01:30:03,070 --> 01:30:07,740
...because you, like most people,
never stop to look at the big picture.

834
01:30:08,610 --> 01:30:11,870
I've been looking at the big picture
everyday for 20 years...

835
01:30:11,950 --> 01:30:13,740
...and I've tried to look forward.

836
01:30:13,780 --> 01:30:15,330
And you know what I see?

837
01:30:15,410 --> 01:30:18,710
I see China maintaining
a stranglehold on freedom...

838
01:30:18,790 --> 01:30:22,420
...influencing our political process
with illegal campaign contributions...

839
01:30:22,460 --> 01:30:26,510
...stealing our most secret military
technology and selling it to our enemies...

840
01:30:26,670 --> 01:30:30,220
...weakening us from the inside,
like a virus.

841
01:30:32,350 --> 01:30:34,970
This trade deal is an invitation
to finish the job.

842
01:30:36,180 --> 01:30:38,680
We intend to cancel that invitation.

843
01:30:39,770 --> 01:30:43,360
We intend to return America to Americans.

844
01:30:44,110 --> 01:30:47,360
We? Who do you think
you are representing?

845
01:30:48,860 --> 01:30:52,950
The people who have steered this nation
for decades behind the scenes.

846
01:30:53,490 --> 01:30:56,410
The people who protect
democracy from itself.

847
01:31:00,830 --> 01:31:03,250
For a woman obsessed
with Chinese conspiracies...

848
01:31:03,330 --> 01:31:07,000
...you sound frighteningly similar
to the government you are trying to stop.

849
01:31:08,800 --> 01:31:10,260
Thanks for stopping by.

850
01:31:11,760 --> 01:31:15,300
And thanks for this useful bit of evidence.

851
01:31:16,060 --> 01:31:18,520
I'm sure you'll find your own way out.

852
01:32:38,100 --> 01:32:40,970
Shit, shit, shit. Just think, girl.

853
01:33:10,130 --> 01:33:11,050
Julia?

854
01:33:11,630 --> 01:33:12,420
Shaw?

855
01:33:12,460 --> 01:33:13,590
Julia. Hello?

856
01:33:13,670 --> 01:33:15,260
You're breaking up. Shaw?

857
01:33:17,300 --> 01:33:19,180
Move where you can get better reception.

858
01:33:20,220 --> 01:33:21,850
-If you can hear me--
-Shaw?

859
01:33:21,930 --> 01:33:23,810
Move where you can get better reception.

860
01:33:24,060 --> 01:33:26,940
I'm locked in the UN building.
Hooks is behind everything.

861
01:33:27,480 --> 01:33:29,480
Julia? Julia?

862
01:33:30,820 --> 01:33:31,770
Shit!

863
01:34:08,980 --> 01:34:09,980
Hey, guys!

864
01:34:10,600 --> 01:34:12,400
You call this a perimeter?

865
01:34:12,480 --> 01:34:15,940
Come on, wake up! Jesus Christ!

866
01:34:18,030 --> 01:34:18,990
Cappella.

867
01:34:19,110 --> 01:34:20,410
America's most wanted.

868
01:34:20,570 --> 01:34:23,330
The man of the hour. Why are you calling?

869
01:34:23,410 --> 01:34:26,580
To explain Chan's murder
or apologize for this afternoon?

870
01:34:26,790 --> 01:34:29,710
Both. You want to meet? Let's meet.

871
01:34:30,790 --> 01:34:33,380
Okay. Are you in the area?

872
01:34:34,460 --> 01:34:36,710
With a rookie boy's head in my sights.

873
01:34:36,920 --> 01:34:38,920
Really? I could live with that.

874
01:34:38,970 --> 01:34:42,010
Get back in your car. Drive to
the other side of the park and pick me up.

875
01:34:42,090 --> 01:34:43,510
No, I've got a better idea--

876
01:34:43,790 --> 01:34:44,510
What the--?

877
01:34:46,930 --> 01:34:49,690
Okay, I get the message. I've got to go.

878
01:34:49,850 --> 01:34:51,230
What are we gonna... What are we gonna do?

879
01:34:51,270 --> 01:34:53,360
Fuck, I don't know, Ray. Figure out something.

880
01:35:02,110 --> 01:35:04,450
Do not underestimate your friend.

881
01:35:04,580 --> 01:35:07,290
There's a reason I chose him
as team leader...

882
01:35:07,410 --> 01:35:10,000
...and there's a reason
I asked you to deal with him.

883
01:35:10,080 --> 01:35:13,290
You obviously do not appreciate
the schedule I'm working with.

884
01:35:13,420 --> 01:35:16,250
I agreed to play Neil because I wanted to...

885
01:35:16,750 --> 01:35:18,420
...not because of the money.

886
01:35:18,510 --> 01:35:22,050
And certainly not because
of your right-wing ideology.

887
01:35:25,260 --> 01:35:27,600
You let me handle Neil. My way.

888
01:35:28,310 --> 01:35:32,310
This is not about male testosterone
between you and your idol.

889
01:35:34,520 --> 01:35:37,190
You were just a cog in the wheel
of a larger machine.

890
01:35:38,440 --> 01:35:41,740
It could've just as easily been you
out there chasing your own tail.

891
01:35:43,410 --> 01:35:44,530
I understand.

892
01:35:45,990 --> 01:35:47,990
What do you want to do about the girl?

893
01:35:50,290 --> 01:35:51,710
It's almost midnight.

894
01:35:53,170 --> 01:35:56,130
Security will be doing a check
of the upper floors.

895
01:35:57,210 --> 01:35:58,750
You have a 30-minute window.

896
01:35:59,670 --> 01:36:01,510
What about the guards in the lobby?

897
01:36:01,800 --> 01:36:03,130
I'll take care of them.

898
01:36:03,590 --> 01:36:04,970
Yes, ma'am.

899
01:36:12,980 --> 01:36:13,980
What?

900
01:36:14,020 --> 01:36:15,810
-Drive.
-Oh, okay.

901
01:36:17,520 --> 01:36:18,980
Where's your first aid kit?

902
01:36:24,610 --> 01:36:25,610
Security.

903
01:36:28,530 --> 01:36:29,660
Yes, ma'am.

904
01:36:32,790 --> 01:36:35,710
Attention. Stand by
for a motion sensor test...

905
01:36:36,170 --> 01:36:40,300
...protocol T-7.
All lobby personnel report to Sublevel 1.

906
01:36:40,340 --> 01:36:44,470
Repeat. Lobby personnel stand down
for a motion sensor diagnostic.

907
01:36:50,850 --> 01:36:52,810
The trail ends with Eleanor Hooks.

908
01:36:52,850 --> 01:36:56,150
My guess is that she was using Chan,
and then she double-crossed him.

909
01:36:56,350 --> 01:36:57,900
It's a long story.

910
01:36:59,020 --> 01:37:00,230
Just drive.

911
01:37:02,190 --> 01:37:03,530
Jesus Christ.

912
01:37:04,650 --> 01:37:07,160
This information has to come out
for you to clear your name.

913
01:37:07,240 --> 01:37:08,530
I can't do that.

914
01:37:08,570 --> 01:37:12,500
Any connection between Wu's murder,
Chan, the Triads and Hooks...

915
01:37:12,700 --> 01:37:14,540
...would kill the trade agreement.

916
01:37:14,620 --> 01:37:15,500
Holy shit.

917
01:37:15,580 --> 01:37:17,420
And completely destabilize the UN.

918
01:37:18,170 --> 01:37:20,540
Damn it, that's it. That's it!

919
01:37:21,420 --> 01:37:24,550
All she has to do is come clean.
Tell the truth.

920
01:37:24,630 --> 01:37:25,420
Truth?

921
01:37:25,510 --> 01:37:29,010
Yeah, the truth about me, about the UN
covert operations unit, everything.

922
01:37:29,180 --> 01:37:32,310
She pins the assassination on you
to discredit the UN?

923
01:37:32,390 --> 01:37:35,520
Taking out the one organization
that could hold it all together.

924
01:37:35,560 --> 01:37:38,230
Back to a cold war.
Give me your business card.

925
01:38:33,580 --> 01:38:34,620
Hello.

926
01:39:26,750 --> 01:39:28,590
Roll your window down so I can see.

927
01:39:29,630 --> 01:39:30,800
Jesus!

928
01:39:41,520 --> 01:39:43,690
Security's not where they're
supposed to be.

929
01:39:43,810 --> 01:39:45,440
Neither am I.

930
01:39:52,360 --> 01:39:53,320
Cappella.

931
01:39:55,950 --> 01:39:57,200
It's for you.

932
01:40:01,250 --> 01:40:02,290
Yes.

933
01:40:06,000 --> 01:40:07,500
Well, I have a proposition for you.

934
01:40:32,360 --> 01:40:33,570
Come on, sweetheart.

935
01:41:10,360 --> 01:41:12,400
All right, you want to play.

936
01:41:23,580 --> 01:41:25,040
Let's have some fun.

937
01:41:30,960 --> 01:41:32,460
The Art of War.

938
01:41:33,550 --> 01:41:34,550
Sun Tzu.

939
01:41:35,470 --> 01:41:37,130
Chapter 13:

940
01:41:38,140 --> 01:41:40,100
"The Doomed Spy"

941
01:41:40,300 --> 01:41:42,640
Does any of this ring a bell?

942
01:41:45,600 --> 01:41:48,060
"Sacrificing an agent
without his knowledge...

943
01:41:48,270 --> 01:41:50,650
"...can turn the battle in your favor."

944
01:41:54,940 --> 01:41:58,610
"Befriending you, gaining your trust..."

945
01:41:59,660 --> 01:42:02,450
"...all the while setting you up
to take the fall. "

946
01:42:02,490 --> 01:42:06,580
You disappointed me, Shaw.
You were always one step behind.

947
01:42:08,250 --> 01:42:12,460
I've got to tell you, my friend.
By the time we're done with you...

948
01:42:12,710 --> 01:42:16,470
...you're gonna make Lee Harvey Oswald
look like a fucking boy scout.

949
01:42:28,310 --> 01:42:32,770
But first, we're gonna have a short class
on Pacific Rim social economics.

950
01:42:33,480 --> 01:42:37,950
Specifically: The effect of
negative Chinese population density...

951
01:42:38,030 --> 01:42:41,570
...and how it relates to
the African-American world view.

952
01:42:42,200 --> 01:42:46,160
In other words, you're gonna watch me
put a bullet in little Miss Shanghai here.

953
01:43:11,020 --> 01:43:12,100
Shit.

954
01:44:18,250 --> 01:44:21,420
I was thinking, neighborhood rules.

955
01:44:23,760 --> 01:44:25,180
Sounds good to me.

956
01:45:02,470 --> 01:45:04,970
It's nice when an opponent
raises the level of play.

957
01:45:05,220 --> 01:45:06,340
You're too kind.

958
01:45:08,600 --> 01:45:10,140
No, I'm not.

959
01:46:46,690 --> 01:46:48,990
There's still one left in the chamber, amigo.

960
01:47:00,880 --> 01:47:03,960
Tell me, master.
What are you gonna do now, huh?

961
01:47:18,680 --> 01:47:19,440
Move.

962
01:48:36,850 --> 01:48:38,310
You all right?

963
01:48:44,810 --> 01:48:45,980
Hello?

964
01:48:50,650 --> 01:48:52,400
Get me out of here!

965
01:48:54,780 --> 01:48:55,780
Hello!

966
01:48:59,910 --> 01:49:01,250
Here's your paper.

967
01:49:02,710 --> 01:49:04,460
Have a nice day, Miss Hooks.

968
01:49:17,050 --> 01:49:18,300
Dramatic.

969
01:49:27,770 --> 01:49:30,070
I'm just reading about your handiwork.

970
01:49:30,810 --> 01:49:33,070
Yeah, well, I was thinking of yours.

971
01:49:33,900 --> 01:49:35,700
You betrayed me, Eleanor.

972
01:49:36,070 --> 01:49:37,070
Shaw.

973
01:49:38,450 --> 01:49:43,950
I thought our Eastern associates would've
made arrangements for you by now.

974
01:49:45,040 --> 01:49:46,790
Well, staying alive is what you pay me for.

975
01:49:48,130 --> 01:49:49,960
But I'm curious.

976
01:49:50,000 --> 01:49:53,010
What makes you think what you did
to Chan won't happen to you?

977
01:49:54,300 --> 01:49:56,550
I don't like to speak ill of the dead...

978
01:49:56,630 --> 01:49:59,640
...but between you and me,
and whoever's listening...

979
01:49:59,890 --> 01:50:02,890
...David Chan was a self-inflated,
pig-headed asshole...

980
01:50:03,430 --> 01:50:06,140
...who no doubt deserved
whatever came his way.

981
01:50:07,020 --> 01:50:08,560
As for you, Shaw...

982
01:50:10,520 --> 01:50:12,190
...well, you're still alive.

983
01:50:12,690 --> 01:50:14,570
You just remember, Eleanor...

984
01:50:15,030 --> 01:50:17,700
...what goes around, comes around.

985
01:50:23,200 --> 01:50:24,580
Sore loser.

986
01:50:30,960 --> 01:50:32,840
Max, you missed the entrance.

987
01:50:41,850 --> 01:50:44,930
Eleanor Hooks was my right-hand man.

988
01:50:45,640 --> 01:50:47,100
She was my mentor.

989
01:50:47,810 --> 01:50:50,900
She taught me
that a successful road to peace...

990
01:50:51,560 --> 01:50:55,150
...is founded on a principle of action,
not reaction.

991
01:50:56,030 --> 01:50:58,700
She said that if what I believed
to be the destiny...

992
01:50:58,820 --> 01:51:03,910
...of the United Nations is to be fulfilled,
then we could not afford to wait around...

993
01:51:03,990 --> 01:51:07,370
...and then react to
a member nation's call for help.

994
01:51:07,790 --> 01:51:10,620
We have to anticipate
to diffuse volatile national...

995
01:51:10,710 --> 01:51:14,500
...and international conditions
before they became explosive.

996
01:51:15,250 --> 01:51:18,220
Before they led us to catastrophe.

997
01:51:18,340 --> 01:51:20,510
So it is in the memory of Eleanor Hooks...

998
01:51:20,590 --> 01:51:21,680
Freeze!

999
01:51:21,970 --> 01:51:25,260
...that I pledge the commitment
of this organization...

1000
01:51:25,430 --> 01:51:29,690
...to a policy of intervention,
a policy of leadership...

1001
01:51:31,730 --> 01:51:35,570
...a policy of aggressive peacekeeping.

1002
01:51:35,940 --> 01:51:37,190
Down on your knees!

1003
01:52:08,600 --> 01:52:10,230
Call the coroner.

1004
01:52:32,160 --> 01:52:34,250
-Ca va bien, Madame?
-Oui, oui.

1005
01:52:37,130 --> 01:52:38,130
Merci.

1006
01:52:59,650 --> 01:53:00,780
C'est la vie.

1007
01:53:05,490 --> 01:53:07,450
Excuse me, do I know you?

1008
01:53:09,290 --> 01:53:11,870
No, I don't think so.

1009
01:53:12,960 --> 01:53:14,290
Do I know you?

1010
01:53:15,500 --> 01:53:18,840
Maybe it was in another lifetime
or something.

1011
01:53:25,010 --> 01:53:27,550
-So... have you eaten?
-I have not.

1012
01:53:43,000 --> 01:53:49,000
