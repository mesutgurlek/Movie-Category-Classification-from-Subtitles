1
00:02:09,728 --> 00:02:11,587
Hello, George. Only me.

2
00:02:11,648 --> 00:02:13,980
How are you today, dear?

3
00:02:15,488 --> 00:02:17,408
Having a little doze,
or just resting your eyes?

4
00:02:17,448 --> 00:02:19,433
I'll make you a fresh cup.

5
00:02:19,808 --> 00:02:21,776
Shan't be a minute.
Couple of biscuits.

6
00:02:40,448 --> 00:02:42,416
Here you are then, dear.

7
00:02:49,088 --> 00:02:51,008
That better?

8
00:02:51,048 --> 00:02:52,976
Yes, thank you.

9
00:02:56,288 --> 00:02:58,279
- A little bit...
- A bit more?

10
00:02:59,168 --> 00:03:01,466
There. Do you need anything else, dear?

11
00:03:01,568 --> 00:03:03,008
You sure?

12
00:03:03,048 --> 00:03:04,976
Drink your tea up
before it gets cold.

13
00:03:05,408 --> 00:03:06,848
I'll be on my way.

14
00:03:06,888 --> 00:03:08,768
Tell lvy I was asking after her, won't you?

15
00:03:08,808 --> 00:03:10,688
And don't get up to any mischief.

16
00:03:10,728 --> 00:03:12,986
Ta ta, dear.

17
00:03:15,968 --> 00:03:17,888
- Hello, Reg.
- Afternoon, Mrs. Drake.

18
00:03:17,928 --> 00:03:19,808
- You all right, dear?
- Can't complain.

19
00:03:19,848 --> 00:03:21,639
- Going off for your tea?
- Yes.

20
00:03:21,728 --> 00:03:23,525
- What you having?
- Bit of bread 'n dripping.

21
00:03:23,648 --> 00:03:26,048
- That all?
- Cup of tea.

22
00:03:26,088 --> 00:03:28,278
Look after yourself, Reg. I told you.

23
00:03:28,448 --> 00:03:30,368
You ought to come over to our
house for tea one night.

24
00:03:30,408 --> 00:03:33,166
- I don't want to put you out.
- oh, don't be daft.

25
00:03:33,248 --> 00:03:36,128
What about tomorrow?
You could come over after work.

26
00:03:36,168 --> 00:03:37,618
You know where we are.
Number 82.

27
00:03:38,048 --> 00:03:39,488
I'll feed you up a bit.

28
00:03:39,528 --> 00:03:41,149
Do you fancy that?

29
00:03:41,408 --> 00:03:43,808
- You sure?
- Be no trouble, Reg.

30
00:03:43,848 --> 00:03:46,333
- Go on, then.
- Oh, lovely.

31
00:03:46,688 --> 00:03:48,128
See you tomorrow, then.

32
00:03:48,168 --> 00:03:50,096
Now don't you forget!

33
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:03,808
- Hello, Nellie.
- All right, Vera?

34
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:06,265
- Isn't it cold?
- Yes.

35
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:31,614
That's better.

36
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:36,951
Nice cup of tea.

37
00:04:55,888 --> 00:04:57,879
- That you, Ethel?
- Hello, Mom.

38
00:05:00,688 --> 00:05:03,020
- Nippy today, weren't it?
- Yes.

39
00:05:30,928 --> 00:05:32,368
Ooh. Hold up, Ethel.

40
00:05:32,408 --> 00:05:34,288
- 'Scuse, Mom.
- What you doing?

41
00:05:34,328 --> 00:05:36,119
I'm washing me hands like you told me to.

42
00:05:36,208 --> 00:05:38,128
- Oh, yes. Your dad's here.
- Hello, Dad.

43
00:05:38,168 --> 00:05:40,926
- Hello, Mom. You all right, Ethel?
- Yes.

44
00:05:41,008 --> 00:05:42,441
- All right, Dad?
- Yes, thank you.

45
00:05:42,448 --> 00:05:44,368
- Good day?
- Not bad, you?

46
00:05:44,408 --> 00:05:46,996
- Can't complain.
- Oh, Ethel. Take the teapot through.

47
00:05:47,248 --> 00:05:49,168
God, I'm starving.
I could eat an 'orse.

48
00:05:49,208 --> 00:05:51,568
Wash your hands, Dad,
I'll put the tin on the table.

49
00:05:51,608 --> 00:05:53,866
Just get me slippers on.

50
00:06:00,688 --> 00:06:03,521
Well he's all on his tod, ain't he?
Seems a nice enough fellow, though.

51
00:06:03,568 --> 00:06:05,488
- Oh yes. Hard worker.
- Is he the little bloke... bald?

52
00:06:05,528 --> 00:06:07,080
- No.
- No. Stocky fellow.

53
00:06:07,408 --> 00:06:08,848
- Lives opposite.
- Oh, yes. Does he?

54
00:06:08,888 --> 00:06:11,578
I shouldn't wonder he don't have bread
and dripping every night.

55
00:06:11,728 --> 00:06:13,168
There ain't nothing wrong
with bread and dripping.

56
00:06:13,208 --> 00:06:14,192
Not every night.

57
00:06:14,608 --> 00:06:16,528
- I wouldn't mind.
- Oh yes? Like to see your face

58
00:06:16,568 --> 00:06:18,928
If I put bread and dripping on the table
every teatime.

59
00:06:18,968 --> 00:06:20,793
No, I'll do him a nice stew.

60
00:06:20,848 --> 00:06:23,146
- Can we have dumplings, Mom?
- Of course, we can.

61
00:06:23,248 --> 00:06:24,688
- I love a dumpling.
- You are a dumpling.

62
00:06:24,728 --> 00:06:26,747
- Oh, that's nice.
- What you got your work clothes on for?

63
00:06:27,088 --> 00:06:28,528
It's a Tuesday, Dad.
I've got me night school.

64
00:06:28,568 --> 00:06:29,968
- Oh, yes.
- That's right.

65
00:06:30,008 --> 00:06:31,868
I've gotta leave in a minute.

66
00:06:32,848 --> 00:06:34,839
Dumpling.

67
00:06:58,208 --> 00:07:00,233
I'm meeting David this evening.

68
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:04,812
You're looking very flat-chested.

69
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:08,652
Have you lost weight?

70
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:12,151
I don't know.

71
00:07:20,127 --> 00:07:22,288
That was lovely, Vera. Thank you very much.

72
00:07:22,528 --> 00:07:24,448
- Very tasty.
- You're welcome, I'm sure.

73
00:07:24,488 --> 00:07:26,368
Why don't you sit on the settee, Reg?
Make yourself at home.

74
00:07:26,408 --> 00:07:28,336
Yeah, Reg. Sit down.
We'll have a smoke.

75
00:07:28,767 --> 00:07:30,208
Make a fresh pot, Ethel.

76
00:07:30,248 --> 00:07:32,938
- Here we are.
- Nah, go on.

77
00:07:35,968 --> 00:07:37,959
- Sid?
- Oh, cheers, mate.

78
00:07:43,167 --> 00:07:45,087
How's work going, Stan?

79
00:07:45,127 --> 00:07:47,488
- Was it motors?
- Motor mechanic, yes.

80
00:07:47,528 --> 00:07:50,184
Well, they bring 'em in.
We mend 'em, push 'em back out again.

81
00:07:50,368 --> 00:07:52,288
It's just the two of us, see?
Me and my brother.

82
00:07:52,328 --> 00:07:54,208
Oh, a family business like?

83
00:07:54,248 --> 00:07:57,088
Well, it's Frank's business.
I work for him... with him.

84
00:07:57,128 --> 00:07:59,215
Have you always worked on the roads,
then, Reg?

85
00:07:59,487 --> 00:08:01,888
- No. I started in the war.
- Oh.

86
00:08:01,928 --> 00:08:03,327
Oh, what kind of war effort
did you have, Reg?

87
00:08:03,367 --> 00:08:04,817
- The pioneer corps.
- Oh, yes?

88
00:08:05,247 --> 00:08:07,167
We laid tarmac on the American bases.

89
00:08:07,207 --> 00:08:08,608
- Did you?
- We did.

90
00:08:08,648 --> 00:08:11,488
- Went out in France... 1940.
- You was out there early?

91
00:08:11,528 --> 00:08:13,854
Dunkirk. We done a running when they
broke through.

92
00:08:13,887 --> 00:08:16,288
Then we went out a few days after D-day.

93
00:08:16,328 --> 00:08:17,550
Same as you, Dad.

94
00:08:17,727 --> 00:08:19,854
'Bout a month after D-day,
we went out there.

95
00:08:20,128 --> 00:08:22,048
- Just after the battle of Caen.
- Oh, yes?

96
00:08:22,088 --> 00:08:24,928
It was murder then. Mind you,
others had it worse than us.

97
00:08:24,968 --> 00:08:26,848
I was in the service corps... driver.

98
00:08:26,888 --> 00:08:30,579
We pushed from Normandy
into northern France, Belgium,

99
00:08:30,688 --> 00:08:32,127
And I ended up in Hamburg.

100
00:08:32,167 --> 00:08:34,047
I was in Hamburg and all, Reg.

101
00:08:34,087 --> 00:08:35,967
- Was you?
- Not then, though.

102
00:08:36,007 --> 00:08:38,834
- No, after the war. National service.
- Oh, I'm with you.

103
00:08:38,847 --> 00:08:41,714
I'll tell you, they've got it worse
over there... the Germans.

104
00:08:41,727 --> 00:08:43,520
We all had it bad.

105
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:46,387
- It weren't cozy for no one, was it?
- Right along, Dad.

106
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:50,240
No, but we done demolition before the war...

107
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:52,765
- Me and my brother.
- Oh, does he live around here?

108
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:55,040
Not now. He's in Australia.

109
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:56,479
- Melbourne.
- Ooh, is he?

110
00:08:56,519 --> 00:08:58,447
He went out two year ago.

111
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:01,637
That's a long way away, isn't it?

112
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:02,720
Well, he was in Burma in the war.

113
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:05,119
- My brother was in Burma.
- Was he?

114
00:09:05,159 --> 00:09:07,039
Well, he met a few Australian blokes,

115
00:09:07,079 --> 00:09:09,599
Came back, married a Scottish girl
and went out there.

116
00:09:09,919 --> 00:09:11,839
Oh, well, I never...

117
00:09:11,879 --> 00:09:13,830
Was he a P.O.W., Reg?

118
00:09:14,719 --> 00:09:16,516
He don't talk about it, Stan.

119
00:09:16,639 --> 00:09:18,698
No, my friend won't talk about it, neither.

120
00:09:21,439 --> 00:09:23,359
You lose any mates, Reg?

121
00:09:23,399 --> 00:09:25,088
A few, yes.

122
00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:27,680
I lost a couple of pals, and all.

123
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:29,519
I lost my best mate.

124
00:09:29,559 --> 00:09:32,249
- Ah, that's right... Bill.
- Did our basic together and everything.

125
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:34,319
Out in Palestine...

126
00:09:34,359 --> 00:09:36,617
he got ambushed in an orange grove.

127
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:39,648
I had to pack his kit up for him like...

128
00:09:41,039 --> 00:09:43,919
Sit next to Reg.

129
00:09:43,959 --> 00:09:45,839
- It's dreadful, isn't it?
- Terrible.

130
00:09:45,879 --> 00:09:47,272
You warm enough, Reg?

131
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:48,872
Put the fire on, Dad.

132
00:09:54,479 --> 00:09:55,920
I lost my mom in the blitz.

133
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:58,184
Did you, Reg?

134
00:09:58,319 --> 00:10:00,239
Chapel Street market, 1941... March.

135
00:10:00,279 --> 00:10:02,640
Well now we remember
that bomb, don't we, Dad?

136
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:04,560
- It blew all the windows out.
- Yes, it did.

137
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:06,084
It was just around the corner, Penton Street.

138
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:07,919
- Opposite the church.
- Oh, yeah.

139
00:10:07,959 --> 00:10:09,839
Our flats never got touched.

140
00:10:09,879 --> 00:10:12,034
She popped in to see my aunt, went shopping...

141
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:14,208
gone.

142
00:10:19,439 --> 00:10:20,880
Another cup of tea, Reg?

143
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:22,848
Sorry to hear that, mate.

144
00:10:25,199 --> 00:10:27,119
That was a lovely spread, Vera.

145
00:10:27,159 --> 00:10:29,087
Thank you very much.

146
00:10:46,319 --> 00:10:48,116
Well, enjoy your pub.

147
00:10:48,239 --> 00:10:50,640
Make sure you wear a coat,
Susan, if you're traveling

148
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:52,560
- in an open top sports car.
- Yes, I am.

149
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:54,528
- Cheerio, chap
- Goodbye, sir.

150
00:11:00,719 --> 00:11:02,710
Good night, Sid.

151
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:05,040
- Night, Dad.
- Night-night, Ethel.

152
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:06,960
Night-night, Dad.

153
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,928
Night, Ethel.

154
00:11:09,359 --> 00:11:11,327
Good night.

155
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:15,600
Where are you tomorrow, Mrs. Wells'?

156
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:17,520
No, Mrs. Fowler's tomorrow.

157
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:19,440
I was at Mrs. Wells' this morning, bless her.

158
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:21,431
- Night-night, love.
- Night, dear.

159
00:11:24,719 --> 00:11:27,517
Ooh, Stanley, your feet!

160
00:11:27,599 --> 00:11:30,466
- Warm 'em up for us.
- Come on, then.

161
00:11:33,359 --> 00:11:35,279
I reckon that Reg would make a good husband

162
00:11:35,319 --> 00:11:36,239
to some nice girl.

163
00:11:36,279 --> 00:11:38,159
Where's a bloke like that gonna meet anybody?

164
00:11:38,199 --> 00:11:40,079
We managed to find each other.

165
00:11:40,119 --> 00:11:42,047
Sure enough.

166
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:44,448
Miracles do happen.

167
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:54,071
Let me go.

168
00:11:54,479 --> 00:11:56,447
Don't.

169
00:11:58,319 --> 00:12:00,310
Stop.

170
00:12:02,159 --> 00:12:04,889
- You're terribly beautiful, you know.
- I should get a...

171
00:12:06,479 --> 00:12:09,359
- I should get a taxi. - Shh.

172
00:12:09,399 --> 00:12:11,224
Come on, let's dance.

173
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:13,645
Don't be silly.

174
00:12:15,119 --> 00:12:17,087
- I do apologize. - What?

175
00:12:18,479 --> 00:12:20,447
I haven't got a gramophone.

176
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:23,807
It's not funny.

177
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:29,519
- It's not funny.
- It's not funny?

178
00:12:29,559 --> 00:12:31,544
It's not funny...

179
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:35,232
Not funny?

180
00:13:12,688 --> 00:13:14,608
Oh, morning, Mrs. Fowler.

181
00:13:14,648 --> 00:13:16,528
Good morning, Mrs. Drake.

182
00:13:16,568 --> 00:13:18,448
Oh, I'm in your way, here?

183
00:13:18,488 --> 00:13:20,416
Lost something?

184
00:13:28,527 --> 00:13:31,407
- I am in your way, aren't I?
- Oh, it's just...

185
00:13:31,447 --> 00:13:33,375
I can't see for looking, sometimes.

186
00:13:33,808 --> 00:13:35,728
I'm like that myself.

187
00:13:35,768 --> 00:13:37,696
Among other things.

188
00:13:55,728 --> 00:13:58,127
All right, Mother?

189
00:13:58,167 --> 00:14:00,061
Ain't you been up today?

190
00:14:11,567 --> 00:14:13,558
Leave it alone.

191
00:14:38,928 --> 00:14:40,848
You getting married yourself, sir?

192
00:14:40,888 --> 00:14:42,440
No, I fear.

193
00:14:42,768 --> 00:14:45,167
No, it'll be a sister of mine
that's getting married.

194
00:14:45,207 --> 00:14:47,087
- Oh, lovely.
- Yeah.

195
00:14:47,127 --> 00:14:50,386
But to tell you the truth,
I haven't met her man yet.

196
00:14:50,448 --> 00:14:52,368
He's a bit of dark horse, so l...

197
00:14:52,408 --> 00:14:54,288
- Just lower your arm for me. - Yeah.

198
00:14:54,328 --> 00:14:56,208
So when are you catching the boat?

199
00:14:56,248 --> 00:14:58,128
A week this Saturday coming.

200
00:14:58,168 --> 00:15:00,494
- Oh, doesn't give us much time, then.
- From Holyhead, I'm goin'.

201
00:15:00,527 --> 00:15:02,290
Just lower your arms for me please, sir.

202
00:15:02,447 --> 00:15:03,888
- Yeah, yeah. - Thank you.

203
00:15:03,928 --> 00:15:05,808
So I'll be having
the waistcoat with it, then?

204
00:15:05,848 --> 00:15:07,400
That's no problem whatsoever, sir.

205
00:15:07,727 --> 00:15:10,607
As I said, it's, uh... we charge
10 guineas for the two-piece suit,

206
00:15:10,647 --> 00:15:12,527
moving up to 13 guineas for the three-piece.

207
00:15:12,567 --> 00:15:14,188
Well I have your money on me now, so...

208
00:15:14,447 --> 00:15:15,887
Oh, lovely.

209
00:15:15,927 --> 00:15:18,287
And I want the jacket just like the one
you have on there.

210
00:15:18,327 --> 00:15:21,167
Well, you have chosen
the double-breasted jacket, sir...

211
00:15:21,207 --> 00:15:22,896
- with the four buttons - Yeah.

212
00:15:23,087 --> 00:15:25,007
Now, the only difference is... your lapel...

213
00:15:25,047 --> 00:15:26,927
is going to fasten down
to the bottom button,

214
00:15:26,967 --> 00:15:28,847
giving it a much more streamlined effect...

215
00:15:28,887 --> 00:15:29,807
Oh.

216
00:15:29,847 --> 00:15:32,071
And what with the light blue bariff
here, plus the stripe

217
00:15:32,207 --> 00:15:34,368
to accentuate your height,
it's bold, it's sharp,

218
00:15:34,607 --> 00:15:36,527
and it's certainly going
to make an impression

219
00:15:36,567 --> 00:15:37,960
when you walk into the church, sir.

220
00:15:37,967 --> 00:15:39,887
Well, that's exactly what I want, sir.

221
00:15:39,927 --> 00:15:41,354
- Just face the mirror for me.
- Yeah.

222
00:15:42,767 --> 00:15:46,127
- I'll be the lord of the manor in this?
- Oh yes, sir.

223
00:15:46,167 --> 00:15:49,028
- I'll be like your man, George Raft.
- You will indeed, sir.

224
00:15:50,927 --> 00:15:52,847
Me daddy won't know me, huh?

225
00:15:52,887 --> 00:15:55,111
Well, if you're going
for the George Raft look, sir...

226
00:15:55,247 --> 00:15:58,080
we can always supply you
with a pair of spats.

227
00:15:58,127 --> 00:16:00,047
Oh, no.
No spats.

228
00:16:00,087 --> 00:16:01,810
Whatever you want, sir.

229
00:16:01,967 --> 00:16:03,407
I'm just going to measure
your outside leg.

230
00:16:03,447 --> 00:16:05,398
Yeah.

231
00:16:11,087 --> 00:16:13,007
Come on.

232
00:16:13,047 --> 00:16:15,202
Seized up?

233
00:16:16,847 --> 00:16:18,838
She's there.

234
00:16:19,727 --> 00:16:21,524
Is Joycie all right?

235
00:16:21,647 --> 00:16:23,808
She's fine.

236
00:16:24,047 --> 00:16:26,015
We ain't seen her in ages.

237
00:16:27,407 --> 00:16:29,327
She's started talking about moving.

238
00:16:29,367 --> 00:16:30,760
Moving where?

239
00:16:30,767 --> 00:16:32,928
To a bigger house.

240
00:16:33,167 --> 00:16:35,087
Your house is big enough, isn't it?

241
00:16:35,127 --> 00:16:37,055
Yes.

242
00:16:39,407 --> 00:16:41,375
- You ain't been there a year.
- I know.

243
00:16:47,567 --> 00:16:49,762
We had a bit of company last night.

244
00:16:49,967 --> 00:16:51,867
- Did you?
- You know what Vera's like.

245
00:16:51,887 --> 00:16:53,807
She finds a young fellow,
lives on his own, no family,

246
00:16:53,847 --> 00:16:56,367
hoicks him in with us,
gives him his tea.

247
00:16:58,127 --> 00:16:59,567
She's got a heart
of gold, that woman.

248
00:16:59,607 --> 00:17:02,832
- She's a diamond.
- You're a lucky man.

249
00:17:02,927 --> 00:17:04,895
You're a lucky man in all, Frank.

250
00:17:35,567 --> 00:17:37,487
What she invite him round for, anyway?

251
00:17:37,527 --> 00:17:39,887
- He lives on his own.
- A lot of people live on their own.

252
00:17:39,927 --> 00:17:42,913
Don't mean you've got to invite them
all round for tea though, does it?

253
00:17:43,247 --> 00:17:44,687
It's just Vera's way, ain't it?

254
00:17:44,727 --> 00:17:46,587
Maybe he wants to be on his own.

255
00:17:47,567 --> 00:17:49,487
She wants to mind her own business.

256
00:17:49,527 --> 00:17:51,407
She's a little busybody, bless her.

257
00:17:51,447 --> 00:17:53,807
She's going to get herself in trouble
one of these days.

258
00:17:53,847 --> 00:17:56,503
I'm glad we moved out here, aren't you?

259
00:17:56,687 --> 00:17:59,567
I seen the washing machine
I want this morning. It's ¡ê25.

260
00:17:59,607 --> 00:18:01,487
Oh no, not now, Frank.
Not your accounts.

261
00:18:01,527 --> 00:18:03,887
- It'll take me 10 minutes.
- I know your "10 minutes."

262
00:18:03,927 --> 00:18:05,855
An hour and 10 minutes, more like.

263
00:18:08,207 --> 00:18:10,573
I thought we was going
to have another early night.

264
00:18:10,607 --> 00:18:12,802
I'll finish this and we can have
an early night.

265
00:18:13,007 --> 00:18:14,941
All right, dear.

266
00:18:20,687 --> 00:18:22,607
Frank?

267
00:18:22,647 --> 00:18:24,575
Frank.

268
00:18:25,967 --> 00:18:27,887
You're asleep!

269
00:18:27,927 --> 00:18:29,855
Don't go to sleep on me.

270
00:18:34,127 --> 00:18:36,118
Frank?

271
00:18:42,287 --> 00:18:44,255
Well, you come on top of me then.

272
00:18:46,127 --> 00:18:49,007
- Come on.
- Can't we leave it till tomorrow?

273
00:18:49,047 --> 00:18:50,975
No, we got to do it now, ain't we?

274
00:19:41,327 --> 00:19:43,318
Afternoon, dear.

275
00:19:44,687 --> 00:19:46,655
Thank you.

276
00:19:50,447 --> 00:19:52,347
This way.

277
00:20:03,887 --> 00:20:05,807
Right then, dear.

278
00:20:05,847 --> 00:20:07,775
First thing we've got to do...

279
00:20:08,687 --> 00:20:10,678
is put the kettle on.

280
00:20:16,847 --> 00:20:18,815
Oh. Got a bowl in here?

281
00:20:32,687 --> 00:20:34,607
Now, where are...?

282
00:20:34,647 --> 00:20:36,575
You got a towel, dear?

283
00:20:44,687 --> 00:20:46,678
Very good. Where's your bed?

284
00:20:48,527 --> 00:20:50,495
Through here.

285
00:20:55,727 --> 00:20:58,457
Now, what I want you to do...

286
00:20:58,607 --> 00:21:00,047
take your
knickers off for me,

287
00:21:00,087 --> 00:21:02,242
lie down here.

288
00:21:02,447 --> 00:21:04,367
Don't you
be upset.

289
00:21:04,407 --> 00:21:06,287
Because I'm here to help you, aren't I?

290
00:21:06,327 --> 00:21:08,207
And that's what I'm going to do. So...

291
00:21:08,247 --> 00:21:10,675
hop your bottom on the bed
and I'll be back in a jiffy.

292
00:22:06,558 --> 00:22:08,549
Here we are, then.

293
00:22:11,358 --> 00:22:13,278
Hop on the bed for me.

294
00:22:13,318 --> 00:22:14,719
How long is it going to take?

295
00:22:14,759 --> 00:22:16,550
Not long, dear.

296
00:22:16,639 --> 00:22:18,559
Open your legs.

297
00:22:18,599 --> 00:22:20,479
You on your own?

298
00:22:20,519 --> 00:22:22,399
Only for a bit.

299
00:22:22,439 --> 00:22:24,492
Now, what I'm going to do
is have a little feel,

300
00:22:24,798 --> 00:22:26,718
Make sure everything's as it should be

301
00:22:26,758 --> 00:22:28,159
and then we'll get
the soapy water inside,

302
00:22:28,199 --> 00:22:30,558
- so you go all floppy for me.
- What do you mean?

303
00:22:30,598 --> 00:22:32,219
Just lie down, dear.

304
00:22:34,879 --> 00:22:36,847
Wet my hand a bit...

305
00:22:37,278 --> 00:22:39,246
and feel.

306
00:22:40,158 --> 00:22:42,149
You're all right. All right...

307
00:22:44,479 --> 00:22:46,470
Push this little tube in.

308
00:22:49,279 --> 00:22:51,270
All right.

309
00:22:52,159 --> 00:22:54,593
Here comes the water.

310
00:23:05,118 --> 00:23:07,038
When you feel full,

311
00:23:07,078 --> 00:23:09,006
we'll stop.

312
00:23:10,878 --> 00:23:12,869
Was you at work, today?

313
00:23:14,127 --> 00:23:17,007
I went in this morning.

314
00:23:17,047 --> 00:23:18,975
- Weather's turned. - Yes.

315
00:23:24,687 --> 00:23:26,678
Now...

316
00:23:28,527 --> 00:23:30,495
- that feel full?
- Yes.

317
00:23:38,127 --> 00:23:40,047
You dry yourself off.

318
00:23:40,087 --> 00:23:41,912
Hold that towel there for a minute

319
00:23:41,967 --> 00:23:43,935
and I'll clean out the bowl.

320
00:23:55,887 --> 00:23:57,807
Now, what's going to happen

321
00:23:57,847 --> 00:23:59,399
is tomorrow or the day after

322
00:23:59,727 --> 00:24:01,647
you'll get a bit of a pain down below.

323
00:24:01,687 --> 00:24:04,047
Take yourself to the toilet,
you'll start bleeding

324
00:24:04,087 --> 00:24:07,039
- then it'll all come away.
- What do you mean, "it will come away"?

325
00:24:07,407 --> 00:24:10,274
lt'll all be over, dear.
You'll be right as rain.

326
00:24:11,727 --> 00:24:13,647
I won't die, will I?

327
00:24:13,687 --> 00:24:15,567
No, dear.

328
00:24:15,607 --> 00:24:17,967
Right. I'll be on my way.

329
00:24:18,007 --> 00:24:19,935
- I'll see meself out.
- It's all right.

330
00:24:26,127 --> 00:24:28,721
- Look after yourself, dear.
- Right.

331
00:24:45,807 --> 00:24:47,570
I've got 200 crate a day,

332
00:24:47,727 --> 00:24:49,647
and he's giving me eight pairs of nylons.

333
00:24:49,687 --> 00:24:50,607
I'll have some nylons.

334
00:24:50,647 --> 00:24:52,527
I'll take three pairs of nylons off you, Sid.

335
00:24:52,567 --> 00:24:55,407
- What you offering?
- Five packets of Players.

336
00:24:55,447 --> 00:24:57,204
What, for three pairs of nylons?

337
00:24:57,327 --> 00:24:59,247
- That's right. - No, no...

338
00:24:59,287 --> 00:25:01,647
These are the Italian nylons.
They ain't the Czech ones.

339
00:25:01,687 --> 00:25:03,308
- Yeah, they're nice, Al.
- I don't care.

340
00:25:03,567 --> 00:25:05,007
I'm offering five packets of Players

341
00:25:05,047 --> 00:25:06,927
for three pairs of nylons,
take it or leave it.

342
00:25:06,967 --> 00:25:08,827
To hold it up, Ron, eh?

343
00:25:08,847 --> 00:25:10,542
I mean either I'm talking
in another language,

344
00:25:10,767 --> 00:25:13,167
- or he's a bit Mutt and Jeff.
- I heard you.

345
00:25:13,207 --> 00:25:15,499
Look. Make it 10 packets.

346
00:25:18,447 --> 00:25:19,887
- I'll give you six... seven.
- Eight.

347
00:25:19,927 --> 00:25:21,807
Look, take 'em out with you Saturday...

348
00:25:21,847 --> 00:25:24,537
"How you doing, darling? Fancy a turn?"
Slip her a pair... happy days!

349
00:25:24,687 --> 00:25:27,019
- All right, eight.
- Done. Good boy.

350
00:25:29,007 --> 00:25:30,927
I'll give you two packets
of tea for a pair.

351
00:25:30,967 --> 00:25:32,918
What are you two, a double act?

352
00:25:37,647 --> 00:25:39,567
- Hello, Lily.
- Your bleedin' stairs.

353
00:25:39,607 --> 00:25:42,447
- they'll be the death of me.
- You've must've heard the kettle boil.

354
00:25:42,487 --> 00:25:44,278
No.

355
00:25:45,327 --> 00:25:47,247
Just made a fresh pot.

356
00:25:47,287 --> 00:25:50,114
How'd that go the other week?

357
00:25:50,127 --> 00:25:51,567
Same as usual.

358
00:25:51,607 --> 00:25:53,797
- Nervous little thing, wasn't she?
- I know.

359
00:25:53,967 --> 00:25:55,887
I put her right.
Set her mind at rest.

360
00:25:55,927 --> 00:25:58,287
- You always do, don't you?
- Don't you want a biscuit, Lily?

361
00:25:58,327 --> 00:26:00,207
Won't say no.

362
00:26:00,247 --> 00:26:02,127
Thank you.

363
00:26:02,167 --> 00:26:04,047
- I've got another one for you.
- Oh, yes?

364
00:26:04,087 --> 00:26:05,742
- Friday, is it?
- Is Friday all right?

365
00:26:05,967 --> 00:26:07,887
- Mm.
- I told her 5:00.

366
00:26:07,927 --> 00:26:09,821
- That's all right, yes.
- Want some tea?

367
00:26:11,727 --> 00:26:14,127
- Sardines?
- I'm all right this week, Lily.

368
00:26:14,167 --> 00:26:16,220
- Oh, now what sweets you got?
- Boiled sweets.

369
00:26:17,967 --> 00:26:20,265
Here you are.
Don't you want some for your Ethel?

370
00:26:20,367 --> 00:26:22,286
How much are them, then?

371
00:26:22,326 --> 00:26:24,687
Tuppence a bag. A penny eighty to you.

372
00:26:24,727 --> 00:26:26,655
Righty-oh.

373
00:26:33,806 --> 00:26:35,726
- Kelp Street.
- Oh, I know.

374
00:26:35,766 --> 00:26:37,626
Nora. She's got seven kids already.

375
00:26:37,646 --> 00:26:39,566
Oh, can't she manage?

376
00:26:39,606 --> 00:26:41,898
- No, could you?
- I've only got a thruppenny bit.

377
00:26:41,967 --> 00:26:43,406
I've got change.

378
00:26:43,446 --> 00:26:44,847
Ain't the husband around?

379
00:26:44,887 --> 00:26:46,508
I expect so.

380
00:26:46,767 --> 00:26:48,687
Can't control himself, if you ask me.

381
00:26:48,727 --> 00:26:51,086
Terrible. Poor woman.

382
00:26:51,126 --> 00:26:53,748
Serves her right.

383
00:26:53,966 --> 00:26:55,886
Don't you want no
sardines for your mother?

384
00:26:55,926 --> 00:26:58,287
No, she can't eat them no more, Lily.
Gives her heartburn.

385
00:26:58,327 --> 00:26:59,948
How's she keeping anyway, your mom?

386
00:27:00,207 --> 00:27:02,127
Oh, you know. Getting older.

387
00:27:02,167 --> 00:27:04,047
Ain't we all?

388
00:27:04,087 --> 00:27:05,967
That's Ethel.

389
00:27:06,007 --> 00:27:08,265
- That you, Ethel?
- Hello, Mom.

390
00:27:08,366 --> 00:27:09,807
- Lily's here.
- Oh.

391
00:27:09,847 --> 00:27:11,468
Hello, Ethel.

392
00:27:12,687 --> 00:27:14,154
Hello.

393
00:27:15,567 --> 00:27:17,535
- You want a cuppa?
- Yes please, Mom.

394
00:27:25,646 --> 00:27:28,526
- Ain't she got a boyfriend yet?
- No.

395
00:27:28,566 --> 00:27:30,494
I ain't surprised.

396
00:27:34,767 --> 00:27:37,166
That was a lovely spread, Vera.
Thank you very much.

397
00:27:37,206 --> 00:27:39,498
- You're welcome, Reg, you know that.
- Doing a bit of mending?

398
00:27:39,567 --> 00:27:41,006
Yes. You got anything that needs doing?

399
00:27:41,046 --> 00:27:43,634
You've got a bit of leg poking
through your trousers.

400
00:27:43,886 --> 00:27:45,327
- Yes, he has.
- I done that at work.

401
00:27:45,367 --> 00:27:47,488
- I ain't got round to it yet.
- You do your own sewing?

402
00:27:47,726 --> 00:27:49,167
Well, I'm all fingers
and thumbs, but I have a go.

403
00:27:49,207 --> 00:27:50,657
You ought to bring 'em over here, Reg.

404
00:27:51,087 --> 00:27:52,526
You need a little patch on that.

405
00:27:52,566 --> 00:27:54,446
I'll get you a bit of cloth
from the shop, Reg.

406
00:27:54,486 --> 00:27:56,744
What is it?
Navy serge, 19 oz.

407
00:27:56,847 --> 00:27:58,246
Give it to Mom, she'll mend it for you,
no problem.

408
00:27:58,286 --> 00:28:00,206
- I could do that.
- Of course, she can.

409
00:28:00,246 --> 00:28:02,902
- Ethel will see you right.
- I don't want to put you out.

410
00:28:03,086 --> 00:28:05,966
- I don't mind.
- Thanks very much.

411
00:28:06,006 --> 00:28:09,163
It'll cost you... half a crown!

412
00:28:09,327 --> 00:28:11,625
- Do you want another sweet?
- Ta.

413
00:28:20,847 --> 00:28:22,767
- What are you doing, love?
- Go back to sleep.

414
00:28:22,807 --> 00:28:25,166
You're ill.

415
00:28:25,206 --> 00:28:26,793
It's going to have to be quick.

416
00:28:27,086 --> 00:28:29,006
- Is it going to take long?
- No, dear.

417
00:28:29,046 --> 00:28:30,926
I haven't told him, you see?
He's supposed to be at work.

418
00:28:30,966 --> 00:28:32,846
- Yes, dear.
- What's he want to come home sick for?

419
00:28:32,886 --> 00:28:34,814
Take your knickers off for me.

420
00:28:37,646 --> 00:28:39,566
Can't have no more kids, see?

421
00:28:39,606 --> 00:28:41,967
I've got seven already.
I ain't having no more.

422
00:28:42,007 --> 00:28:43,887
- I know, dear.
- It'd kill me.

423
00:28:43,927 --> 00:28:45,855
Lay the towel on the bed for me.

424
00:28:50,607 --> 00:28:52,575
You sit right on the edge.

425
00:28:53,487 --> 00:28:55,318
- What's that?
- Just soapy water, dear...

426
00:28:55,407 --> 00:28:57,272
a bit of disinfectant.

427
00:28:57,327 --> 00:28:59,488
- Do you want me to lie down?
- Stay where you are.

428
00:28:59,726 --> 00:29:02,606
- I've just got to get this inside.
- All right.

429
00:29:02,646 --> 00:29:04,526
All right. You all right?

430
00:29:04,566 --> 00:29:06,494
Yes.

431
00:29:54,846 --> 00:29:56,766
Oy, oy.

432
00:29:56,806 --> 00:29:59,291
- What?
- See them, blonde, brunette?

433
00:29:59,646 --> 00:30:01,614
- Oh, tidy!
- Ain't they?

434
00:30:03,486 --> 00:30:05,386
How do you do?

435
00:30:06,366 --> 00:30:09,246
Right, 'o mugger... bright-eyed,
bushy-tailed and look lively.

436
00:30:09,286 --> 00:30:10,907
- We only just got here.
- Oh, come on, Kenny,

437
00:30:11,166 --> 00:30:14,329
- let your hair down.
- Enjoy the view.

438
00:31:08,766 --> 00:31:11,633
- Let's have a swap, eh?
- All right.

439
00:31:26,527 --> 00:31:28,447
Do you reckon she likes him?

440
00:31:28,487 --> 00:31:30,367
Well, she's gone for a walk with him.

441
00:31:30,407 --> 00:31:33,495
She wouldn't go, would she,
if she didn't like him. Would she?

442
00:31:35,646 --> 00:31:37,773
He should take her out dancing.

443
00:31:38,047 --> 00:31:40,845
- I don't think he's that type.
- I can't see Reg dancing.

444
00:31:46,206 --> 00:31:49,086
She'd come back
black and blue, wouldn't she?

445
00:31:49,126 --> 00:31:51,554
- Dad.
- she'd have to give her feet a soak.

446
00:31:52,926 --> 00:31:55,292
They might turn out
to be a proper Fred and Ginger,

447
00:31:55,327 --> 00:31:57,192
The pair of them. You never know.

448
00:32:18,846 --> 00:32:21,576
- Did you have to come far?
- Not far, dear, no.

449
00:32:22,686 --> 00:32:24,085
Are you sure you
wouldn't like a drink?

450
00:32:24,127 --> 00:32:26,152
No, thank you.

451
00:32:26,526 --> 00:32:28,927
- Have you done this before, dear?
- Yes, as it happens.

452
00:32:28,967 --> 00:32:30,656
Here we are...

453
00:32:30,847 --> 00:32:32,767
One bowl, one towel.

454
00:32:32,807 --> 00:32:34,687
- Kettle's on.
- Oh. Thank you.

455
00:32:34,727 --> 00:32:37,086
Are you sure you wouldn't like a drink?

456
00:32:37,126 --> 00:32:38,144
No, dear.

457
00:32:38,527 --> 00:32:40,495
What?

458
00:32:46,207 --> 00:32:48,127
You know, your hair looks really lovely.

459
00:32:48,167 --> 00:32:50,047
- Do you think so?
- Yes.

460
00:32:50,087 --> 00:32:52,015
Oh.

461
00:32:53,406 --> 00:32:55,203
Why don't you make us all a cup of tea?

462
00:32:55,326 --> 00:32:57,294
What, do you want a cup of tea as well?

463
00:32:58,687 --> 00:33:00,655
Oh.

464
00:33:01,086 --> 00:33:03,054
Good luck.

465
00:33:05,886 --> 00:33:07,326
All right, dear.

466
00:33:07,366 --> 00:33:09,191
You're gonna have
to take your knickers off.

467
00:33:09,246 --> 00:33:11,180
Okey-dokey.

468
00:33:14,046 --> 00:33:16,014
So, how are you?

469
00:33:16,366 --> 00:33:17,806
This is rather a surprise.

470
00:33:17,846 --> 00:33:20,707
- Haven't seen you for ages.
- Yes... no...

471
00:33:21,646 --> 00:33:23,566
Sugar?

472
00:33:23,606 --> 00:33:25,534
No, thank you.

473
00:33:29,166 --> 00:33:31,566
- Thank you for coming today.
- Yeah? Not at all.

474
00:33:31,606 --> 00:33:33,759
An excuse to get out
of that dreary old bank.

475
00:33:33,799 --> 00:33:35,679
Would you like a fag?

476
00:33:35,719 --> 00:33:37,613
No, thank you.

477
00:33:40,766 --> 00:33:42,666
Thank you for...

478
00:33:42,686 --> 00:33:44,606
Sorry.

479
00:33:44,646 --> 00:33:46,574
What's the matter?

480
00:33:48,926 --> 00:33:50,846
Oh, sorry.

481
00:33:50,886 --> 00:33:52,766
Have some cake.
I had a piece before you arrived.

482
00:33:52,806 --> 00:33:54,734
Can't resist... it's delicious.

483
00:33:56,126 --> 00:33:58,060
I wanted to talk to you.

484
00:33:59,006 --> 00:34:00,446
Fire away.

485
00:34:00,486 --> 00:34:02,573
Um.

486
00:34:03,758 --> 00:34:05,487
You're the first person I thought of.

487
00:34:05,678 --> 00:34:07,646
Really.

488
00:34:16,238 --> 00:34:18,229
Crikey, Susan. What is it?

489
00:34:21,438 --> 00:34:23,429
I have this, um...

490
00:34:24,798 --> 00:34:26,789
friend, who...

491
00:34:32,718 --> 00:34:34,709
she needs some help.

492
00:34:37,518 --> 00:34:39,509
I'm sorry.

493
00:34:40,766 --> 00:34:42,734
Sorry.

494
00:34:48,558 --> 00:34:50,822
You've got yourself
into trouble, haven't you?

495
00:34:53,166 --> 00:34:55,157
Oh, Susan. You clot.

496
00:34:58,926 --> 00:35:00,917
Who told you to phone me?

497
00:35:08,526 --> 00:35:11,461
All right. I'll tell you
what you have to do.

498
00:35:16,206 --> 00:35:18,606
Oh, and when you see the psychiatrist,
you have to make up a fearful fib

499
00:35:18,646 --> 00:35:21,404
about some potty aunt
or something or other.

500
00:35:22,446 --> 00:35:24,366
Here. Have a hanky.

501
00:35:24,406 --> 00:35:26,334
Thank you.

502
00:35:29,166 --> 00:35:31,157
You'll be all right, you know.

503
00:35:42,526 --> 00:35:44,687
Hello, George. Oh... hello, Peggy!

504
00:35:44,926 --> 00:35:46,846
You off work, today?

505
00:35:46,886 --> 00:35:47,806
Sit up, then

506
00:35:47,846 --> 00:35:49,726
Oh, she's all right, George. Bless her.

507
00:35:49,766 --> 00:35:51,646
This has slipped a bit.

508
00:35:51,686 --> 00:35:53,566
Ivy taken bad again, has she?

509
00:35:53,606 --> 00:35:56,535
Oh, dear. Well I'll make
a fresh pot of tea.

510
00:35:58,366 --> 00:36:00,766
And you'll want a biscuit,
Peggy, I shouldn't wonder.

511
00:36:03,166 --> 00:36:05,086
- Hello, lvy.
- All right, Vera?

512
00:36:05,126 --> 00:36:07,006
Having one of your bad days?

513
00:36:07,046 --> 00:36:08,926
- I'm sick of it.
- Oh, dear.

514
00:36:08,966 --> 00:36:10,826
I'll put the kettle on.

515
00:36:21,405 --> 00:36:23,305
Didn't you sleep last night, dear?

516
00:36:23,325 --> 00:36:25,418
You don't sleep
when you're like this, do you?

517
00:36:27,165 --> 00:36:29,085
Have you managed to kip at all today?

518
00:36:29,125 --> 00:36:31,486
- No, I ain't.
- Oh, ain't you?

519
00:36:31,526 --> 00:36:33,249
Still, you're in the best place, lvy.

520
00:36:33,406 --> 00:36:35,805
I should be at work.

521
00:36:35,845 --> 00:36:37,725
You can't go to work in this state.

522
00:36:37,765 --> 00:36:39,454
Somebody's got to earn the money.

523
00:36:39,645 --> 00:36:42,046
If I stay off, she wants to stay off.

524
00:36:42,086 --> 00:36:43,966
I'll lose me job if this goes on.

525
00:36:44,006 --> 00:36:45,886
It's not your fault, dear.

526
00:36:45,926 --> 00:36:47,325
Try telling that to your boss.

527
00:36:47,365 --> 00:36:50,205
They don't understand nothing, men.

528
00:36:50,245 --> 00:36:52,139
Bastards.

529
00:36:58,686 --> 00:37:00,449
Now...

530
00:37:00,606 --> 00:37:02,526
is this your first pregnancy?

531
00:37:02,566 --> 00:37:04,446
Yes.

532
00:37:04,486 --> 00:37:06,366
And what does the father say?

533
00:37:06,406 --> 00:37:08,766
Um...

534
00:37:08,806 --> 00:37:10,686
I don't want my parents to know.

535
00:37:10,726 --> 00:37:12,813
No, no, no.
I mean the father of the child.

536
00:37:16,926 --> 00:37:19,258
Big as you can.
Come and sit down.

537
00:37:27,438 --> 00:37:30,202
Have you considered
the possibility of having the child?

538
00:37:32,238 --> 00:37:34,229
I can't.

539
00:37:35,998 --> 00:37:37,918
Very well. I'll help you,

540
00:37:37,958 --> 00:37:39,838
But I'm afraid we are obliged to discuss

541
00:37:39,878 --> 00:37:42,534
The delicate matter of money.

542
00:37:42,718 --> 00:37:44,686
It'll come to ¡ê150.00.

543
00:37:45,598 --> 00:37:47,930
How much do you have available?

544
00:37:47,998 --> 00:37:51,358
Um, just over ¡ê100.00.

545
00:37:51,398 --> 00:37:53,417
I see.

546
00:37:53,758 --> 00:37:55,678
Well...

547
00:37:55,718 --> 00:37:59,038
Let's say 100 guinea, shall we?
In advance. In cash.

548
00:37:59,078 --> 00:38:01,529
Now, I shall require you
to see a psychiatrist.

549
00:38:01,886 --> 00:38:05,185
- I know.
- Do you?

550
00:38:06,045 --> 00:38:07,965
Yes.

551
00:38:08,005 --> 00:38:09,885
And I'll arrange the nursing home...

552
00:38:09,925 --> 00:38:11,716
and the obstetrician.

553
00:38:11,805 --> 00:38:14,206
Baxter. Terribly good man.

554
00:38:14,246 --> 00:38:16,174
Any questions?

555
00:38:19,006 --> 00:38:20,997
Pretty day.

556
00:38:22,365 --> 00:38:24,356
Yes.

557
00:38:25,726 --> 00:38:28,125
- How many weeks pregnant are you?
- Seven.

558
00:38:28,165 --> 00:38:30,059
And were you a virgin?

559
00:38:36,765 --> 00:38:38,426
Yes.

560
00:38:39,645 --> 00:38:41,086
Miss Wells, it would be helpful

561
00:38:41,126 --> 00:38:43,714
If you would give me
simple and honest answers

562
00:38:43,966 --> 00:38:45,934
If you can.

563
00:38:47,325 --> 00:38:49,316
What does your father do?

564
00:38:51,646 --> 00:38:53,637
- My father?
- Yes.

565
00:38:57,406 --> 00:38:59,374
Um, he works in the Ministry of Defense.

566
00:39:00,286 --> 00:39:02,186
And are your parents happily married?

567
00:39:04,126 --> 00:39:07,857
Um, I think so.

568
00:39:08,926 --> 00:39:11,895
Is there any history
of mental illness in your family?

569
00:39:13,726 --> 00:39:15,646
Yes...

570
00:39:15,686 --> 00:39:18,342
an aunt of my mother's committed suicide.

571
00:39:20,446 --> 00:39:22,437
Did she?

572
00:39:23,805 --> 00:39:25,796
Yes.

573
00:39:28,126 --> 00:39:31,254
And your own mental state, how would you
describe it at the moment?

574
00:39:34,365 --> 00:39:37,630
- Um.
- Anxious?

575
00:39:39,646 --> 00:39:41,637
Depressed?

576
00:39:43,965 --> 00:39:46,559
Tell me your feelings
towards the father of the child.

577
00:39:48,765 --> 00:39:50,685
- Do you love him?
- No.

578
00:39:50,725 --> 00:39:52,550
- Does he love you?
- No.

579
00:39:52,605 --> 00:39:54,525
Did you love him
at the point of conception?

580
00:39:54,565 --> 00:39:56,493
No.

581
00:39:57,886 --> 00:39:59,820
Did he force himself on you?

582
00:40:12,765 --> 00:40:14,685
Miss Wells...

583
00:40:14,725 --> 00:40:16,605
if you were to have the child,

584
00:40:16,645 --> 00:40:18,525
would you keep it or have it adopted?

585
00:40:18,565 --> 00:40:20,445
I can't have it.

586
00:40:20,485 --> 00:40:22,413
I'd rather kill myself.

587
00:40:27,165 --> 00:40:29,565
Well, I don't think
we can allow that to happen...

588
00:40:31,486 --> 00:40:33,477
can we?

589
00:40:37,725 --> 00:40:39,693
Tea's brewing.

590
00:41:21,885 --> 00:41:23,785
- Miss Wells.
- Hello.

591
00:41:23,805 --> 00:41:25,238
- I'm Nurse Willoughby.
- How do you do?

592
00:41:25,246 --> 00:41:27,166
- Is this all your luggage?
- Uh, yes.

593
00:41:27,206 --> 00:41:29,930
- If you'd like to follow me.
- Thank you.

594
00:41:30,046 --> 00:41:31,966
- Have you had far to come?
- Not really, no.

595
00:41:32,006 --> 00:41:33,405
- Miss Wells.
- Hello.

596
00:41:33,445 --> 00:41:34,997
- Sister Beech.
- How do you do?

597
00:41:35,325 --> 00:41:37,245
I hope you'll be comfortable.

598
00:41:37,285 --> 00:41:39,179
Thank you.

599
00:42:10,845 --> 00:42:12,813
There, dear.

600
00:42:13,725 --> 00:42:15,693
I'll put this back under the bed for you.

601
00:42:23,806 --> 00:42:25,797
Now... that didn't take too long, did it?

602
00:42:28,125 --> 00:42:30,526
- What, you finished already?
- Yes, dear.

603
00:42:30,566 --> 00:42:32,084
So when am I going to see you again?

604
00:42:32,446 --> 00:42:34,845
What did you say, dear?

605
00:42:34,885 --> 00:42:37,109
You have to come back, yes?

606
00:42:38,206 --> 00:42:40,126
Oh no, dear.
I've done all I've got to do.

607
00:42:40,166 --> 00:42:41,684
Now you've just got to wait.

608
00:42:42,046 --> 00:42:44,445
What is it I'm waiting for?

609
00:42:44,485 --> 00:42:46,811
For it to come away, dear.

610
00:42:46,846 --> 00:42:49,726
But all you used
was a little bit of water.

611
00:42:49,766 --> 00:42:51,646
Don't you worry.

612
00:42:51,686 --> 00:42:53,085
What happens if something goes wrong?

613
00:42:53,125 --> 00:42:55,005
Now what's going to happen is this...

614
00:42:55,045 --> 00:42:56,973
tomorrow...

615
00:42:58,366 --> 00:43:00,765
or Sunday, you'll have a pain down below.

616
00:43:00,805 --> 00:43:02,685
Get yourself to the toilet.

617
00:43:02,725 --> 00:43:06,018
You'll start bleeding, it'll all come
away, you'll be right as rain.

618
00:43:08,445 --> 00:43:10,436
What you need now
is a nice hot cup of tea.

619
00:43:12,285 --> 00:43:14,253
Take care, dear.

620
00:43:19,005 --> 00:43:20,973
Ta ta.

621
00:43:40,558 --> 00:43:42,549
- Hello, dear.
- Good morning, Mrs. Drake.

622
00:43:46,318 --> 00:43:48,445
- Hello, Mommy.
- Good morning, dear.

623
00:43:49,677 --> 00:43:51,597
- How was your weekend?
- Lovely, thank you.

624
00:43:51,637 --> 00:43:53,517
How was Norfolk?

625
00:43:53,557 --> 00:43:55,437
Oh, bearable.

626
00:43:55,477 --> 00:43:57,357
Terribly sunny.

627
00:43:57,397 --> 00:43:59,325
Extraordinary.

628
00:44:17,517 --> 00:44:19,437
Have you got the money?

629
00:44:19,477 --> 00:44:21,357
I've got the ¡ê2.00.

630
00:44:21,397 --> 00:44:23,655
- ¡ê2.00?
- That's what she told me.

631
00:44:23,758 --> 00:44:25,678
Well, she told you wrong.
It's two guineas.

632
00:44:25,718 --> 00:44:27,598
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- Ain't no use being sorry.

633
00:44:27,638 --> 00:44:29,463
Oh. You want payment now then, do you?

634
00:44:29,518 --> 00:44:31,486
Well, I don't want payment next week, do I?

635
00:44:38,637 --> 00:44:40,078
Where is your husband, anyway?

636
00:44:40,118 --> 00:44:42,273
Korea, since you're asking.

637
00:44:43,437 --> 00:44:45,357
- In the forces, is he?
- Yes.

638
00:44:45,397 --> 00:44:48,019
- Two guineas.
- Thank you very much.

639
00:44:52,077 --> 00:44:54,045
So it's not his, then?

640
00:44:56,398 --> 00:44:58,389
What's the matter?
Cat got your tongue?

641
00:45:03,597 --> 00:45:05,517
Done this for a lot
of girls then, have you?

642
00:45:05,557 --> 00:45:07,437
Mind your own bleedin' business.

643
00:45:07,477 --> 00:45:09,598
- I'm only asking.
- And I'm only telling you.

644
00:45:10,317 --> 00:45:12,308
Right.

645
00:45:15,117 --> 00:45:17,108
You put your address down there.

646
00:45:18,957 --> 00:45:20,877
She'll be there at 5:00.

647
00:45:20,917 --> 00:45:22,317
Don't mention the money.

648
00:45:22,357 --> 00:45:24,237
That's between me and you.

649
00:45:24,277 --> 00:45:26,157
- Is that understood?
- Yes.

650
00:45:26,197 --> 00:45:28,091
Good.

651
00:45:35,645 --> 00:45:37,086
Can you do one on Friday?

652
00:45:37,126 --> 00:45:38,525
- At 5:00?
- Yes.

653
00:45:38,565 --> 00:45:39,753
That's all right.

654
00:45:39,966 --> 00:45:41,405
- Married lady.
- Oh, yes?

655
00:45:41,445 --> 00:45:43,600
- Got herself in a bit of trouble.
- How is that, then?

656
00:45:43,806 --> 00:45:45,726
Having a bit of "how's your father"
on the side.

657
00:45:45,766 --> 00:45:48,024
- Oh, that's not right, is it, Lily?
- Well, I don't think so.

658
00:45:49,085 --> 00:45:51,076
Still, gotta help them out, ain't you?

659
00:45:51,965 --> 00:45:53,865
How'd you get on with that darkie?

660
00:45:53,885 --> 00:45:55,944
- Oh, I did feel sorry for her.
- Long way from home?

661
00:45:56,286 --> 00:45:57,685
She was very scared.

662
00:45:57,725 --> 00:45:59,166
What are they doing over here, anyways?

663
00:45:59,206 --> 00:46:02,046
Trying to make a better
life for themselves, I shouldn't wonder.

664
00:46:02,086 --> 00:46:04,445
- They should stay where they are.
- They're hard workers.

665
00:46:04,485 --> 00:46:07,278
- You need any sugar?
- How much you charging this week, Lily?

666
00:46:07,325 --> 00:46:09,245
¡ê1.80, to you.

667
00:46:09,285 --> 00:46:11,213
All right, then.

668
00:46:16,446 --> 00:46:18,437
- Here you are.
- Ta.

669
00:46:20,286 --> 00:46:22,277
Thank you.

670
00:46:34,205 --> 00:46:35,570
I'm ever so scared.

671
00:46:35,646 --> 00:46:37,910
Try not to upset yourself, dear.

672
00:46:38,045 --> 00:46:39,486
S- sorry...

673
00:46:39,526 --> 00:46:41,406
I've got to pull myself together.

674
00:46:41,446 --> 00:46:45,240
Oh, I've got to go through with this.

675
00:46:45,246 --> 00:46:47,166
Oh, I know I have to... it's just that...

676
00:46:47,206 --> 00:46:49,086
nobody knows...

677
00:46:49,126 --> 00:46:51,006
well, my friend knows,
but she doesn't know...

678
00:46:51,046 --> 00:46:52,974
I mean she doesn't know it's today.

679
00:46:54,846 --> 00:46:58,205
So if anything were to happen to me...
no one would know.

680
00:46:58,245 --> 00:47:00,537
You've got to get your knickers off,
dear, and lie down.

681
00:47:03,005 --> 00:47:04,925
Oh. Oh, no. No, no, no.

682
00:47:04,965 --> 00:47:06,893
No, no, no.

683
00:47:09,725 --> 00:47:11,645
Oh, no. No...

684
00:47:11,685 --> 00:47:14,512
I'm a terrible person!

685
00:47:30,366 --> 00:47:32,334
What's the matter?

686
00:47:33,725 --> 00:47:35,352
Nothing.

687
00:47:35,645 --> 00:47:37,565
Ain't you had a nice night?

688
00:47:37,605 --> 00:47:39,485
Yes.

689
00:47:39,525 --> 00:47:41,453
You?

690
00:47:54,845 --> 00:47:56,836
You ever thought about moving out?

691
00:47:58,206 --> 00:48:00,197
What do you mean?

692
00:48:02,525 --> 00:48:04,493
What do you think about getting married?

693
00:48:06,846 --> 00:48:08,766
What, to you?

694
00:48:08,806 --> 00:48:10,734
Yes.

695
00:48:14,526 --> 00:48:16,517
I ain't never thought about it.

696
00:48:18,366 --> 00:48:20,357
- I've been thinking about it.
- Have you?

697
00:48:21,246 --> 00:48:23,237
About three or four weeks.

698
00:48:30,846 --> 00:48:32,837
What do you reckon?

699
00:48:35,646 --> 00:48:37,546
Do you wanna?

700
00:48:43,326 --> 00:48:45,317
Yes.

701
00:48:46,685 --> 00:48:48,676
I do.

702
00:49:00,606 --> 00:49:02,597
All right, then.

703
00:49:11,166 --> 00:49:13,134
Better tell your mom.

704
00:49:28,446 --> 00:49:30,366
Dad...

705
00:49:30,406 --> 00:49:32,285
- Dad, wake up.
- What's the matter?

706
00:49:32,325 --> 00:49:34,253
I've got to go in the kitchen.

707
00:49:39,965 --> 00:49:42,126
Woke me up...

708
00:49:42,845 --> 00:49:45,177
- oh, hello, Reg.
- Hello, Stan.

709
00:49:45,245 --> 00:49:47,165
Good kip?

710
00:49:47,205 --> 00:49:49,133
Yes, all right.

711
00:49:52,797 --> 00:49:54,788
Can I have a word, Stan?

712
00:49:58,557 --> 00:50:00,548
What's the matter?

713
00:50:04,317 --> 00:50:06,512
Can I have your permission to marry Ethel?

714
00:50:12,477 --> 00:50:14,206
Have you asked her?

715
00:50:14,397 --> 00:50:16,365
Yes.

716
00:50:18,237 --> 00:50:19,966
What'd she say?

717
00:50:20,157 --> 00:50:22,148
She said yes.

718
00:50:23,997 --> 00:50:25,917
Well, of course you can.

719
00:50:25,957 --> 00:50:27,837
- You sure?
- Congratulations!

720
00:50:27,877 --> 00:50:29,737
- Thanks very much.
- Vera? Ethel?

721
00:50:29,757 --> 00:50:32,157
- You know what he's just asked me?
- I'm ever so pleased.

722
00:50:32,197 --> 00:50:34,077
- I'm delighted!
- Me too.

723
00:50:34,117 --> 00:50:37,240
- What's all this chatting about?
- These two just got engaged!

724
00:50:37,437 --> 00:50:39,357
- Congratulations, mate!
- Thanks very much.

725
00:50:39,397 --> 00:50:41,277
I was asleep on that chair, there.

726
00:50:41,317 --> 00:50:43,197
Sorry about waking you up.

727
00:50:43,237 --> 00:50:44,892
Oh, don't you worry about that.

728
00:50:45,117 --> 00:50:47,997
- I asked her last night.
- Oh, did you?

729
00:50:48,037 --> 00:50:49,917
Well done, the both of you.

730
00:50:49,957 --> 00:50:52,511
Wow, Reg, good going.

731
00:50:56,157 --> 00:50:58,557
- Don't look so worried.
- You're sure?

732
00:50:58,597 --> 00:51:00,957
Of course, I'm sure.
I've been to the doctors and I'm sure.

733
00:51:00,997 --> 00:51:02,397
About time and all.

734
00:51:02,437 --> 00:51:04,317
You have to start taking things easy.

735
00:51:04,357 --> 00:51:06,046
What, you gonna look after me?

736
00:51:06,237 --> 00:51:08,205
- Yes.
- Are you?

737
00:51:09,597 --> 00:51:11,517
We have to tell Stan and Vera.

738
00:51:11,557 --> 00:51:13,437
Yes, we'll tell Stan and Vera...

739
00:51:13,477 --> 00:51:15,357
but we'll tell them together, properly.

740
00:51:15,397 --> 00:51:17,277
We'll go around there...

741
00:51:17,317 --> 00:51:20,157
- next weekend.
- I'll ask him in the morning.

742
00:51:20,197 --> 00:51:22,125
Can I have my washing machine now, please?

743
00:51:56,157 --> 00:51:58,077
- Morning, Frank.
- Morning, Stan.

744
00:51:58,117 --> 00:51:59,567
Got some news for you.

745
00:51:59,805 --> 00:52:02,330
What?

746
00:52:04,125 --> 00:52:06,045
Here you are.
Have a guess.

747
00:52:06,085 --> 00:52:07,485
Good news, or bad news?

748
00:52:07,525 --> 00:52:09,405
- Bad news.
- Wrong. Try again.

749
00:52:09,445 --> 00:52:11,373
All right, good news.

750
00:52:14,685 --> 00:52:16,676
Come on, then. What is it?

751
00:52:18,525 --> 00:52:20,445
Eh?

752
00:52:20,485 --> 00:52:22,379
Spill the beans, old cock!

753
00:52:23,805 --> 00:52:25,725
My little Ethel? She got engaged.

754
00:52:25,765 --> 00:52:27,165
- What?
- Yesterday afternoon.

755
00:52:27,205 --> 00:52:28,962
- What, to Reg?
- I couldn't believe it.

756
00:52:29,085 --> 00:52:31,053
I thought they'd be courting for years.

757
00:52:35,805 --> 00:52:37,725
- Congratulations.
- Thank you, Frank.

758
00:52:37,765 --> 00:52:39,645
You must be a very proud man.

759
00:52:39,685 --> 00:52:41,565
You should've seen Vera's face.

760
00:52:41,605 --> 00:52:43,533
It was a bolt from the blue.

761
00:52:45,405 --> 00:52:46,845
So, on Sunday...

762
00:52:46,885 --> 00:52:48,285
you and Joycie got to
come over for your tea.

763
00:52:48,325 --> 00:52:50,412
We'll get some beers in...
some sherry for the girls.

764
00:52:50,685 --> 00:52:52,605
We'll toast the happy couple
and Reg can meet the family.

765
00:52:52,645 --> 00:52:54,334
- On Sunday.
- About 4:00.

766
00:52:54,525 --> 00:52:56,857
- You tell Joycie?
- I'll tell her.

767
00:53:01,245 --> 00:53:03,165
Can you feel that, dear?
Starting to fill up?

768
00:53:03,205 --> 00:53:04,598
Yes.

769
00:53:04,604 --> 00:53:06,524
- Does that feel peculiar, Pam?
- Yes, Mom.

770
00:53:06,564 --> 00:53:07,965
That's how it's meant to feel, ain't it?

771
00:53:08,005 --> 00:53:09,364
- Peculiar?
- Yes.

772
00:53:09,404 --> 00:53:11,167
- You've done this before, ain't you?
- Yes, dear.

773
00:53:11,324 --> 00:53:13,224
- So, it's safe.
- It's safe, isn't it?

774
00:53:13,244 --> 00:53:14,575
- Yes, darling.
- And when it's full,

775
00:53:14,685 --> 00:53:16,084
that's when we'll stop.

776
00:53:18,044 --> 00:53:19,964
I know your face from somewhere.

777
00:53:20,004 --> 00:53:21,884
- Who, me?
- Yes.

778
00:53:21,924 --> 00:53:23,852
- Do you?
- I can't think where, though.

779
00:53:26,205 --> 00:53:28,125
You all right?

780
00:53:28,165 --> 00:53:30,524
Of course. Sunlight laundry.

781
00:53:30,564 --> 00:53:33,404
- Oh, dear.
- It's Vera, ain't it?

782
00:53:33,444 --> 00:53:35,372
- That's right.
- Vera Drake.

783
00:53:36,284 --> 00:53:37,725
I knew your mother before the war.

784
00:53:37,765 --> 00:53:40,057
- Did you?
- Was you doing this back then?

785
00:53:40,124 --> 00:53:41,565
That feel full, dear?

786
00:53:41,605 --> 00:53:43,533
Yes.

787
00:53:45,405 --> 00:53:47,396
All right.

788
00:53:49,245 --> 00:53:51,236
Just dry yourself off.

789
00:54:11,804 --> 00:54:13,772
Get that down you, come on.

790
00:54:14,045 --> 00:54:15,965
Cold. Cold.

791
00:54:16,005 --> 00:54:17,885
Cool you down.

792
00:54:17,925 --> 00:54:19,819
Cool you down.

793
00:54:31,805 --> 00:54:33,773
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

794
00:54:37,405 --> 00:54:39,373
Hello again, Pamela.
How are you feeling?

795
00:54:39,805 --> 00:54:41,725
Poorly, hmm?

796
00:54:41,765 --> 00:54:43,645
Now, I need to take
another look at your tummy.

797
00:54:43,685 --> 00:54:46,045
Don't worry,
I'll be as gentle as I can.

798
00:54:46,085 --> 00:54:48,513
Pamela, we just need you
to straighten your legs.

799
00:54:49,405 --> 00:54:51,032
Good girl. Right onto the bed.

800
00:54:51,325 --> 00:54:54,685
I promise you, I have very warm hands.

801
00:54:54,725 --> 00:54:57,415
Bring your bottom up.
Good girl. That's it.

802
00:54:59,485 --> 00:55:01,180
Now, I'm going to press gently

803
00:55:01,405 --> 00:55:04,238
And I want you to tell me
what happens when I let go.

804
00:55:04,285 --> 00:55:05,725
Good girl, well done.

805
00:55:05,765 --> 00:55:08,125
- We'll do an internal, Sister.
- All right, doctor.

806
00:55:11,485 --> 00:55:13,851
Now then, Mrs. Barnes,

807
00:55:13,885 --> 00:55:17,725
I, uh... I don't have
very good news, I'm afraid.

808
00:55:17,765 --> 00:55:21,085
- Why, why, what's happening?
- I'm going to have to operate.

809
00:55:21,125 --> 00:55:23,485
- Pamela is a very sick girl.
- She ain't gonna die, is she?

810
00:55:23,525 --> 00:55:25,405
We sincerely hope not, Mrs. Barnes,

811
00:55:25,445 --> 00:55:28,285
But this is a grave situation,
as I'm sure you'll understand.

812
00:55:28,325 --> 00:55:29,725
Now then...

813
00:55:29,765 --> 00:55:31,454
when Pamela was admitted this evening,

814
00:55:31,644 --> 00:55:33,564
you stated that she was having a miscarriage.

815
00:55:33,604 --> 00:55:35,031
Yes.

816
00:55:35,484 --> 00:55:37,782
But that isn't the whole truth, is it?

817
00:55:39,324 --> 00:55:41,244
Mrs. Barnes...

818
00:55:41,284 --> 00:55:43,474
did you do something to Pamela to try

819
00:55:43,645 --> 00:55:45,565
- to bring about a termination?
- No, I didn't!

820
00:55:45,605 --> 00:55:46,862
Well, somebody did.

821
00:55:47,004 --> 00:55:49,495
You know that and I know that.

822
00:55:50,844 --> 00:55:54,205
Mrs. Barnes, I've been a doctor
for over 25 years.

823
00:55:54,245 --> 00:55:56,604
Sister and I see cases like this
every weekend,

824
00:55:56,644 --> 00:55:59,004
- don't we, Sister?
- Yes, we do.

825
00:56:01,885 --> 00:56:04,752
All right...

826
00:56:04,765 --> 00:56:06,733
someone come to the house.

827
00:56:08,124 --> 00:56:09,557
And what did they do?

828
00:56:09,565 --> 00:56:11,964
She grated pink soap
into a bowl of warm water

829
00:56:12,004 --> 00:56:13,363
and she had a bottle of stuff and she put...

830
00:56:13,405 --> 00:56:16,169
- And she used a syringe.
- Yes.

831
00:56:16,285 --> 00:56:18,205
And no doubt, she'll use her syringe again.

832
00:56:18,245 --> 00:56:20,400
And again and again
and again, and Sister and I

833
00:56:20,604 --> 00:56:22,970
will have to deal with dozens of cases
just like Pamela's.

834
00:56:23,005 --> 00:56:25,473
Mrs. Barnes, these people must be stopped.

835
00:56:29,244 --> 00:56:31,164
You're going to have to inform the police.

836
00:56:31,204 --> 00:56:33,758
I ain't talking to them.

837
00:56:35,964 --> 00:56:37,884
Sister Coombes.

838
00:56:37,924 --> 00:56:40,444
Righty-oh. They're ready for you
in theater, Mr. Walsh.

839
00:56:41,724 --> 00:56:44,090
Thank you, Sister.

840
00:56:44,125 --> 00:56:47,484
Mrs. Barnes, if you don't inform
the police, I'm going to have to.

841
00:56:47,524 --> 00:56:50,749
Unfortunately, it's my
legal obligation to do so.

842
00:56:50,845 --> 00:56:52,813
Excuse me.

843
00:57:08,125 --> 00:57:11,005
- Excuse me, nurse.
- Yes, sir?

844
00:57:11,045 --> 00:57:13,885
We're police officers.
We're looking for Sister Coombes.

845
00:57:13,925 --> 00:57:15,853
Oh yes, sir, just follow me.

846
00:57:20,124 --> 00:57:22,115
Sister, it's police.

847
00:57:24,445 --> 00:57:26,844
Good evening, sister.
I'm Detective Inspector Webster,

848
00:57:26,884 --> 00:57:28,764
- this is D.S. Vickers...
- Good evening.

849
00:57:28,804 --> 00:57:30,732
Oh, good evening.

850
00:57:33,916 --> 00:57:35,645
We was sitting by the side of the road,

851
00:57:35,836 --> 00:57:38,669
there was bodies everywhere... stink, petrol...

852
00:57:38,716 --> 00:57:40,636
I'd had enough.

853
00:57:40,676 --> 00:57:42,556
I couldn't do nothing.

854
00:57:42,596 --> 00:57:44,476
Couldn't run away, couldn't cry,

855
00:57:44,516 --> 00:57:46,410
couldn't feel nothing...
I just sat there.

856
00:57:47,837 --> 00:57:50,135
And all of a sudden,
there was this old girl...

857
00:57:50,236 --> 00:57:52,156
staggering past us,

858
00:57:52,196 --> 00:57:54,124
muttering in French.

859
00:57:55,036 --> 00:57:57,004
Guess what she was carrying under her arm?
