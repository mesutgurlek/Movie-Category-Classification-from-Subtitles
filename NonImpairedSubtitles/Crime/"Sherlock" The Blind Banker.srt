WOMAN: The great artisans say
the more the teapot is used

3
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:20,360
the more beautiful it becomes.

4
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:28,320
The pot is seasoned by repeatedly
pouring tea over the surface.

5
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:35,640
The deposit left on the clay creates
this beautiful patina over time.

6
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:41,080
Some pots, the clay has been
burnished by tea made
over 400 years ago.

The clay is cracking.

14
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:17,200
Well, I can't see how a tiny splash
of tea is going to help.

15
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:20,000
Sometimes
you have to look hard at something

16
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,520
to see its value.

17
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:25,760
See?

18
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:27,960
This one shines a little brighter.

19
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:31,040
I don't suppose...

00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:32,160
Um, I mean...

21
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:35,080
I don't suppose
that you want to have a drink?

22
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:40,400
Not tea, obviously.
Um, in a pub, with me, tonight.

00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,480
Um...?

24
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:44,640
You wouldn't like me all that much.

25
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:48,040
Can I maybe decide that for myself?

26
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:54,000
I can't.

What? Why not?

53
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:01,880
Because I had a row in the shop

You had a row with a machine?!

Mine was in the bedroom.

00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:59,840

We were at uni together, and this guy
here had a trick he used to do.

97
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:09,120
It's not a trick.

98
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:11,160
He could look at you
and tell you your whole life story.

99
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:14,600
Yes, I've seen him do it. Put the
wind up everybody, we hated him.

100
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:16,720
We'd come down to breakfast
in the formal hall

101
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:18,760
and this freak would know you'd been
shagging the previous night.

102
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:21,120
I simply observed.
Go on, enlighten me.

103
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:24,920
Two trips a month,
flying all the way around the world,
you're quite right.

104
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:28,440
How could you tell? Are you going
to tell me there's a stain on my tie

105
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:30,920
from some special kind of ketchup
you can only buy in Manhattan?

106
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:33,400
No, I...
Is it the mud on my shoes?

107
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:37,400
I was just chatting with
your secretary outside.

108
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:38,960
She told me.

That door didn't open last night?

126
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:46,080
There's a hole in our security.

130
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:52,720
Tell me how he got in.

131
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:54,240
There's a bigger one on its way.

132
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:57,440
I don't need an incentive,
Sebastian.

133
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:03,000
He's, er...
CLEARS THROAT
..he's kidding you, obviously.

134
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,760
Shall I look after that for him?

135
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:06,240

Two trips around the world

137
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:01,560
You didn't ask his secretary,
you said that just to irritate him.

138
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:03,400
How did you know?
Did you see his watch?

139
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:05,160
His watch?

140
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:06,880
The time was right,
but the date was wrong.

141
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:10,240
Said two days ago. Crossed the date
line twice and he didn't alter it.

142
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:12,480
Within a month?
How did you get that? New Breitling.

143
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:13,920
Only came out this February.

144
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,640
OK. So do you think we should
sniff around here for a bit longer?

145
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:20,640
Got everything I need
to know already, thanks.

146
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:21,880
That graffiti was a message.

147
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:25,160
Someone at the bank,
working on the trading floors.

148
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:27,800
We find the intended recipient
and...

149
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:29,800
They'll lead us to the person
who sent it?

150
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:30,800
Obvious.

151
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:32,920
Well, there's 300 people up there,
who was it meant for?

152
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:35,440
Pillars. What?

153
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:36,520
Pillars and the screens.

154
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:38,320
Very few places
you could see that graffiti from.

155
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:41,760
That narrows the field considerably.
And, of course, the message was left

156
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:44,040
at 11.34 last night.
That tells us a lot.

157
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:45,880
Does it?
Traders come to work at all hours.

158
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:47,640
Some trade with Hong Kong
in the middle of the night.

159
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:52,000
That message was intended for
somebody who came in at midnight.

160
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,760
Not many Van Coons
in the phone book.

00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:55,800
Taxi!

162
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:12,040
BUZZES

163
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:19,640
So what do we do now? Sit here
and wait for him to come back?

164
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:21,600
Just moved in. What?

165
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:24,880
Floor above, new label.
Could have just replaced it.

166
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:26,880
BUZZES

167
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:30,000
No-one ever does that.
WOMAN: Hello?

168
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:34,680
Hi, um, I live in the flat just
below you. I don't think we've met.

169
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:37,280
No, well, er, I've just moved in.

170
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:42,440
Actually, I've just locked
my keys in my flat.

171
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:43,840
Do you want me to buzz you in?

172
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:46,360
Yeah. And can we use your balcony?

173
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:47,480
What?!

174
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:26,760
DOOR BUZZES

175
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:29,840
WATSON: Sherlock?

176
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:31,800
WATSON: Sherlock, are you OK?

177
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:39,960
Yeah, any time
you feel like letting me in(!)

178
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:56,400
Do you think he'd lost a lot of
money?

179
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:58,600
Suicide is pretty common
among City boys.

180
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:00,640
We don't know that it was suicide.
Come on.

181
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:03,760
The door was locked from the inside,
you had to climb down the balcony.

182
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:07,880
Been away three days
judging by the laundry.

183
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:12,200
Look at the case, there was
something tightly packed inside it.

184
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:15,040
Thanks. I'll take your word for it.
Problem?

185
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:18,680
Yeah, I'm not desperate to root
around some bloke's dirty underwear.

186
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:22,240
Those symbols at the bank, the
graffiti, why were they put there?

187
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:24,320
Some sort of code? Obviously.

188
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:26,720
Why were they painted? Want to
communicate, why not use e-mail?

189
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:28,320
Well, maybe he wasn't answering.

190
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:29,840
Oh, good, you follow.

191
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:31,680
No.

192
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:34,280
What kind of a message
would everyone try to avoid?

193
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:37,320
What about this morning?

194
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:40,800
Those letters you were looking at?
Bills?

195
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:45,880
Yes. He was being threatened.

196
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:47,440
MAN'S VOICE IN BACKGROUND

197
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:48,520
Not by the Gas Board.

198
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:51,320
DIMMOCK: ...see if we can get prints
off this glass.

199
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:53,280
Sergeant, we haven't met.

200
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:54,600
Yeah, I know who you are

201
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:57,000
and I would prefer it if you didn't
tamper with any of the evidence.

202
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:05,760
I phoned Lestrade. Is he on his way?
He's busy. I'm in charge.

203
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:09,600
And it's not Sergeant,
it's Detective Inspector Dimmock.

204
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:15,240
We're obviously
looking at a suicide.

205
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:17,840
It does seem the only explanation
of all the facts.

206
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:20,360
Wrong, it's one possible explanation
of some of the facts.

207
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:22,760
You've got a solution that you like,
but you are choosing

208
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:24,800
to ignore anything you see
that doesn't comply with it.

209
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:26,720
Like? Wound's on the right side of
his head.

210
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:28,000
And? Van Coon was left-handed.

211
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,440
Requires quite a bit of contortion.

212
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:34,080
Left-handed? I'm amazed you
didn't notice. All you have to do
is look around this flat.

213
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:36,000
Coffee table on the left-hand side,

214
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,640
coffee mug handle
pointing to the left.

215
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:40,080
Power sockets, habitually used
the ones on the left. Pen and paper

216
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:43,400
on the left of the phone.
Picked up with his right,
took messages with his left.

217
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:45,200
D'you want me to go on?
No, I think you've covered it.

218
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:46,960
I might as well, I'm almost
at the bottom of the list.

219
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:49,680
There's a knife on the breadboard
with butter on the right side
of the blade

220
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:51,400
because he used it with his left.
It's highly unlikely

221
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:53,640
that a left-handed man would shoot
himself in the right of his head.

222
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:55,800
Conclusion, someone broke in here
and murdered him -

223
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:57,720
only explanation
of all of the facts.

224
00:16:57,720 --> 00:16:59,800
But the gun?
He was waiting for the killer.

225
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:02,640
He'd been threatened. What?

226
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:05,520
Today at the bank, sort of a warning.

227
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:07,560
He fired a shot
when his attacker came in.

228
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:10,080
And the bullet?
Went through the open window.

229
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:12,000
Oh, come on(!)

230
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,760
What are the chances of that?!

231
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:16,000
Wait until you get the ballistics
report.

232
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,800
The bullet in his brain wasn't
fired from his gun, I guarantee it.

233
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:23,040
If his door was locked from the
inside, how did the killer get in?

234
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:25,920
Good, you're finally asking
the right questions.

235
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:35,240
He's left trying to sort of
cut his hair with a fork,

236
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:37,040
which of course can never be done.

237
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:39,920
It was a threat,
that's what the graffiti meant.

238
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:41,080
I'm kind of in a meeting.

239
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:43,440
Can you make an appointment
with my secretary?

240
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:46,680
I don't think this can wait.
Sorry, Sebastian.

241
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:50,680
One of your traders, someone who
worked in your office, was killed.

242
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:52,480
What? Van Coon.

243
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:53,560
The police are at his flat.

244
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:55,440
Killed?!
Sorry to interfere

245
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:58,640
with everyone's digestion.
Still want to make an appointment(?)

246
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:00,920
Would maybe nine o'clock
at Scotland Yard suit?

247
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:08,800
Harrow, Oxford...very bright guy.

248
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:12,840
Worked in Asia for a while, so...

249
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:14,520
You gave him the Hong Kong accounts?

250
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:20,760
Lost 5 million in a single morning,
made it all back a week later.

251
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:22,360
Nerves of steel, Eddie had.

252
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:24,760
Who'd want to kill him?
We all make enemies.

253
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:26,520
You don't all end up with a bullet
through your temple.

254
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:28,960
MOBILE RINGS
Not usually. Excuse me.

255
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,200
It's my chairman.

256
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:36,080
Police have been on to him.

257
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:38,000
Apparently they're telling him

258
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,880
it was a suicide.
Well, they've got it wrong,

259
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:41,080
Sebastian. He was murdered.

260
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:43,960
Well, I'm afraid
they don't see it like that.

261
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:46,200
So? And neither does my boss.

262
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:49,400
I hired you to do a job.
Don't get sidetracked.

263
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:52,880
FADING FOOTSTEPS

264
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:55,320
I thought bankers were all supposed
to be heartless bastards.

265
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:04,600
HORN BLARES

266
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:46,320
I need you to get over to Crispians.

267
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:50,440
Two Ming vases up for auction -
Chenghua.

268
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:54,640
Will you appraise them? Soo Lin
should go - she's the expert.

269
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:57,240
Soo Lin has resigned her job.
I need you.

270
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:48,040
PHONE RINGING

271
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:53,640
Just locum work.
No, that's fine.

272
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:57,840
You're, um...
Well, you're a bit over-qualified.

273
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:01,920
Er, I could always do
with the money.

274
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:05,440
Well, we've got two
away on holiday this week

275
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:07,920
and one's just left to have a baby.

276
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:10,680
It might be a bit mundane for you.

277
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:14,480
Er, no, mundane is good, sometimes.

278
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:16,080
Mundane works.

279
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:20,280
It says here you were a soldier.
And a doctor.

280
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:24,680
Anything else you can do?

281
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:26,720
I learned the clarinet at school.

282
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:31,360
Oh...
LAUGHS
..well, I'll look forward to it.

283
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:41,120
I said, could you pass me a pen?

284
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:44,520
What? When?
About an hour ago.

285
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:48,440
Didn't notice I'd gone out then?

286
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,480
I went to see about a job
at that surgery.

287
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:55,400
How was it?
Great. She's great.

288
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:57,360
Who?

289
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:58,640
The job.

290
00:21:58,640 --> 00:21:59,720
She?!

291
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:01,840
It.

292
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:05,160
Yeah, have a look.

293
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:13,400
"The intruder
who can walk through walls."

294
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:14,520
It happened last night.

295
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:16,800
Journalist shot dead in his flat.

296
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:18,680
Doors locked,
windows bolted from the inside.

297
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:20,440
Exactly the same as Van Coon.

298
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:24,480
God! You think...?
He's killed another one.

299
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:36,520
Brian Lukis,
freelance journalist,

300
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:38,880
murdered in his flat.

301
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:40,920
Doors locked from the inside.

302
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:43,080
You've got to admit,
it's similar.

303
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:46,400
Both men killed by someone
who can walk through solid walls.

304
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:50,120
Inspector, do you seriously believe
that Eddie Van Coon was

305
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:51,520
just another city suicide?

306
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:56,800
SIGHS
You have seen
the ballistics report, I suppose?

307
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:59,160
And the shot that killed him.
Was it fired from his own gun?

308
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:01,560
No. No.
So this investigation might move

309
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:04,200
a bit quicker if you were
to take my word as gospel.

310
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:09,840
I've just handed you
a murder inquiry.

311
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:12,040
Five minutes in his flat.

312
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:42,200
Four floors up.

313
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:44,960
That's why they think they're safe.

314
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:48,080
Put a chain across the door,
bolt it shut, think they're
impregnable.

315
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:54,040
They don't reckon for one second
that there's another way in.

316
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:58,960
I don't understand. Dealing
with a killer who can climb.

317
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:02,200
What are you doing?
Clings to the walls like an insect.

318
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:04,280
CLUNK!
That's how he got in.

319
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:05,280
What?!

320
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:08,360
He climbed up the side of the walls,
ran along the roof,

321
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:10,320
dropped in through this skylight.

322
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:12,400
You're not serious?! Like Spider-Man?

323
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:15,720
He scaled six floors of a Docklands
apartment building,

324
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:19,240
jumped the balcony and killed
Van Coon. Oh, hold on(!)

325
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:23,720
That's how he got into the bank -
ran along the window ledge
onto the terrace.

326
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:26,200
I have to find out
what connects these two men.

327
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:57,280
Date stamped on the book
is the same day that he died.

328
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:07,680
Sherlock?

329
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,520
So, the killer goes to the bank,

330
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:22,640
leaves a threatening cipher
at the bank.

331
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:25,400
Van Coon panics, returns
to his apartment, locks himself in.

332
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:27,440
Hours later, he dies.

333
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:32,320
The killer finds Lukis at the
library, he writes the cipher

334
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:34,920
on the shelf where he knows
it'll be seen. Lukis goes home.

335
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:38,120
Late that night, he dies too.

336
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:41,920
Why did they die, Sherlock?

337
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:44,920
Only the cipher can tell us.

338
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:53,160
The world's run on
codes and ciphers, John.

339
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:55,800
From the million-pound
security system at the bank
to the PIN machine

340
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:59,000
you took exception to. Cryptography
inhabits our every waking moment.

341
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,560
Yes, OK, but...

342
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:02,320
But it's all computer generated -

343
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:04,840
electronic codes,
electronic ciphering methods.

344
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:06,640
This is different.

345
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:08,760
It's an ancient device.

346
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:11,120
Modern code-breaking methods
won't unravel it.

347
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:13,000
Where are we headed?
I need to ask some advice.

348
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,400
What?! Sorry?

349
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:18,920
You heard me perfectly.
I'm not saying it again.

350
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:20,640
You need advice?
On painting.

351
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:22,360
Yes, I need to talk to an expert.

352
00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:25,280
SIREN WAILS

353
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,120
Part of a new exhibition.

354
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:35,960
Interesting.
I call it...

355
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:39,400
Urban Bloodlust Frenzy.
CHUCKLES

356
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:41,280
Catchy(!)

357
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:44,080
I've got two minutes before
a Community Support Officer

358
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:45,360
comes around that corner.

359
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:47,920
Can we do this while I'm working?

360
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:57,240
Know the author?
I recognise the paint.

361
00:26:57,240 --> 00:26:59,960
It's like Michigan...hard-core
propellant.

362
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:01,160
I'd say zinc.

363
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:03,680
And what about the symbols?
Do you recognise them?

364
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:05,840
I'm not even sure
it's a proper language.

365
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:09,120
Two men have been murdered, Raz.

366
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:11,240
Deciphering this is the key
to finding out who killed them.

367
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:14,160
And this is all you've
got to go on(?)

368
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:16,960
It's hardly much, is it?
Are you going to help us or not?

369
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:19,600
I'll ask around.

370
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:22,080
Somebody must know something
about it. Oi!

371
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:25,280
METALLIC CLATTERING

372
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:28,160
What the hell do you think you're
doing? This gallery is a listed
public building.

373
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:30,520
No, no. Wait, wait.
It's not me who painted that.

374
00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:32,000
I was just holding this for...

375
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:39,280
Bit of an enthusiast, are we?

376
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:41,920
POLICE RADIO IN BACKGROUND

377
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:46,560
She was right in the middle of
an important piece of restoration.

378
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:48,480
Why would she suddenly resign?

379
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:50,560
Family problems.
She said so in her letter.

380
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:53,560
But she doesn't have a family.
She came to this country on her own.

381
00:27:53,560 --> 00:27:56,000
Andy! Look, those teapots,
those ceramics.

382
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,800
They've become her obsession.

383
00:27:57,800 --> 00:28:00,280
She's been working on restoring them
for weeks.

384
00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:03,760
I can't believe
that she would just...abandon them.

385
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:07,000
Perhaps she was getting
a bit of unwanted attention?

386
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:17,640
DOOR SLAMS

387
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:20,360
You've been a while.

388
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:24,800
Yeah, well, you know how it is.

389
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:27,840
Custody sergeants don't really
like to be hurried, do they?

390
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:30,360
Just formalities. Fingerprints,

391
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:32,960
charge sheet, and I've got to be
in magistrates' court on Tuesday.

392
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:37,040
What? Me, Sherlock!
In court, on Tuesday!

393
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:39,680
They're giving me an ASBO!
Good, fine.

394
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:43,040
You want to tell your little pal
he's welcome to go and own up
any time.

395
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:45,280
This symbol, I still can't place it.

396
00:28:45,280 --> 00:28:46,920
No, I need you to go
to the police station

397
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:50,120
and ask about the journalist.
The personal effects
will have been impounded.

398
00:28:50,120 --> 00:28:53,440
Get hold of his diary, or something
that will tell us his movements.

399
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:55,160
Go and see Van Coon's PA.

400
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:58,720
If you retrace their steps,
somewhere they'll coincide.

401
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:06,080
SHUTTER CLICKS

402
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:09,280
Scotland Yard.

403
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:21,280
Flew back from Dalian Friday.

404
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:24,120
Looks like he had back-to-back
meetings with the sales team.

405
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:25,600
Can you print me up a copy?

406
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:27,640
Sure.
What about the day he died?

407
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:30,680
Can you tell me where he was?
Sorry, I've got a gap.

408
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:33,520
I have all his receipts.

409
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:36,520
Your friend...
Listen, whatever you say,

410
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:38,120
I'm behind you 100 per cent.

411
00:29:38,120 --> 00:29:39,600
...he's an arrogant sod.

412
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:44,000
Well, that was mild.
People say a lot worse than that.

413
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:48,520
This is what you wanted, isn't it?
The journalist's diary?

414
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:57,480
What kind of a boss was he, Amanda?
Appreciative?

415
00:29:57,480 --> 00:30:01,040
Um, no. That's not a word I'd use.

416
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:04,800
The only things Eddie appreciated
had a big price tag.

417
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:07,520
Like that hand cream.
He bought that for you, didn't he?

418
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:15,600
Look at this one.

419
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:18,000
Got a taxi from him
on the day he died, £18.50.

420
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,840
That would get him to the office.

421
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:22,560
Not rush hour. Check the time.
Mid-morning. 18 would get him

422
00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:25,920
as far as... ..The West End.
I remember him saying.

423
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:29,040
Underground,
printed at one in Piccadilly.

424
00:30:29,040 --> 00:30:32,000
So he got a Tube back to the office.

425
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,400
Why would he get a taxi into town,
and then the Tube back?

426
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:36,640
Because he was delivering
something heavy.

427
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:38,520
You wouldn't lug a package
up the escalator.

428
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:40,440
Delivering?!

429
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:42,440
To somewhere near
Piccadilly Station.

430
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:44,760
Dropped the package,
delivered it, and then...

431
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:50,000
Stopped on his way. He got peckish.

432
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:56,600
So you bought your lunch
from here en route to the station

433
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:58,240
but where were you headed from?

434
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:00,160
Where did the taxi drop you?

435
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:01,880
Oof! Right.

436
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:03,840
Eddie Van Coon brought a package
here the day he died.

437
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:05,320
Whatever was hidden inside
that case...

438
00:31:05,320 --> 00:31:07,280
I've managed to piece
together a picture

439
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:10,800
using scraps of information -
credit card bills, receipts.
He flew back from China,

440
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:12,320
then he came here. Sherlock.

441
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:14,680
Somewhere in this street, somewhere
near. I don't know where, but...

442
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:18,800
That shop, over there.
How could you tell?

443
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:20,160
Lukis' diary. He was here too.

444
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:23,360
He wrote down the address. Oh.

445
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:44,320
SHOP BELL RINGS

446
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:49,360
Hello.

447
00:31:55,160 --> 00:31:57,800
You want...lucky cat?

448
00:31:57,800 --> 00:32:00,440
No, thanks, no.

449
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:03,200
£10! £10!

450
00:32:04,560 --> 00:32:07,480
I think your wife, she will like.

451
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:09,480
Um, thank you.

452
00:32:17,040 --> 00:32:18,640
Sherlock...

453
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:23,800
The label there.
Yes, I see it.

454
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:25,400
It's exactly the same as the cipher.

455
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:30,240
WATSON CLEARS THROAT

456
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:35,120
It's an ancient number system -
Hang Zhou.

457
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:37,480
These days only street traders
use it.

458
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:40,640
Those were numbers written on the
wall at the bank and at the library.

459
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:43,720
Numbers written in
an ancient Chinese dialect.

460
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:45,400
It's a 15.

461
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:47,520
What we thought was the
artist's tag, it's a number 15.

462
00:32:47,520 --> 00:32:51,480
And the blindfold, the horizontal
line. That was a number as well.

463
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:53,880
The Chinese number one, John.
We found it.

464
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:02,800
Two men travel back from China,

465
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:07,440
both head straight for
the Lucky Cat emporium.

466
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:09,640
What did they see?

467
00:33:09,640 --> 00:33:11,720
It's not what they saw.

468
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:15,080
It's what they both brought back
in those suitcases.

469
00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:18,240
And you don't mean duty free.

470
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:19,600
Thank you.

471
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:26,000
Think about what Sebastian told us.

472
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,720
About Van Coon, about
how he stayed afloat in the market.

473
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:31,640
Lost 5 million.
Made it back in a week.

474
00:33:31,640 --> 00:33:33,480
That's how he made such easy money.

475
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:36,240
He was a smuggler. Mm.

476
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:38,040
Cover would have been perfect.

477
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:42,360
Businessman,
making frequent trips to Asia.

478
00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:45,560
Lukis was the same,
a journalist writing about China.

479
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:48,000
Both of them smuggled stuff about.

480
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,280
The Lucky Cat was their drop-off.

481
00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:52,440
But why did they die?

482
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:56,120
It doesn't make sense.
If they both turn up at the shop
and deliver the goods,

483
00:33:56,120 --> 00:33:57,800
why would someone threaten them

484
00:33:57,800 --> 00:34:01,040
and kill them after the event,
after they'd finished the job?

485
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:07,160
What if one of them
was light-fingered?

486
00:34:07,160 --> 00:34:09,120
How do you mean? Stole something.

487
00:34:09,120 --> 00:34:10,640
Something from the hoard.

488
00:34:10,640 --> 00:34:12,640
The killer doesn't know
which of them took it

489
00:34:12,640 --> 00:34:14,120
so threatens them both. Right.

490
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:18,720
Remind me.

491
00:34:18,720 --> 00:34:21,320
When was the last time
that it rained?

492
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:32,160
It's been here since Monday.

493
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:35,760
HE RINGS DOORBELL

494
00:34:43,640 --> 00:34:46,920
No-one's been in that flat
for at least three days.

495
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:48,960
Could have gone on holiday.

496
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:51,760
Do you leave your windows open
when you go on holiday?

497
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:01,760
METALLIC SCREECH

00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:12,840
Someone else has been here.

501
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:17,480
Somebody else broke into the flat
and knocked over the vase,
just like I did.

502
00:35:25,120 --> 00:35:28,480
SNIFFS
DOORBELL RINGS

503
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:30,520
Do you think maybe
you could let me in this time?

504
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:37,720
Can you not keep doing this, please?

505
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:45,880
I'm not the first.

506
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:50,920
What?
Somebody's been in here before me.

507
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:53,520
What are you saying?

508
00:35:56,040 --> 00:35:59,040
Size eight feet.

509
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:03,800
Small, but...athletic.

510
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:05,600
I'm wasting my breath.

Small, strong hands.

00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:16,440
Our acrobat.

514
00:36:17,960 --> 00:36:20,360
Why didn't he close the window
when he lef...?

515
00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:23,280
Oh, stupid, stupid!

516
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:25,280
Obvious.

517
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:26,880
He's still here.

John...

521
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:56,440
John!

522
00:36:58,160 --> 00:37:00,160
Oh, I'm Sherlock Holmes
and I always work alone

523
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:03,160
because no-one else can compete
with my massive intellect(!)

GROANS

527
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:47,880
The milk's gone off
and the washing's started to smell.

528
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:50,760
Somebody left here in a hurry
three days ago. Somebody?

529
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:54,480
Soo Lin Yao. We have to find her.

530
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:56,200
How, exactly?

531
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:02,080
We could start with this.

532
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:05,080
You've gone all croaky.
Are you getting a cold?

533
00:38:05,080 --> 00:38:06,720
COUGHS
I'm fine.

534
00:38:08,040 --> 00:38:10,440
When was the last time
that you saw her?

535
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:12,960
ANDY: Three days ago.
Here at the museum.

536
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:16,920
This morning they told me
she'd resigned.

537
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:20,480
Just like that.
Left her work unfinished.

538
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:24,360
What was the last thing that she did
on her final afternoon?

539
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:33,680
She does this demonstration
for the tourists, a tea ceremony.

540
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:38,280
So she would have packed up her
things and just put them in here.

541
00:38:56,520 --> 00:38:58,480
We have to get to Soo Lin Yao.

542
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:00,800
If she's still alive.
Sherlock!

543
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:03,440
Oh, look who it is.

544
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:04,880
Found something you'll like.

545
00:39:11,240 --> 00:39:13,240
Tuesday morning,

546
00:39:13,240 --> 00:39:15,360
all you've got to do is turn up
and say the bag was yours.

547
00:39:15,360 --> 00:39:16,960
Forget about your court date.

548
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:24,480
GIRL: Dude, that was rad!

549
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:28,960
You want to hide a tree, then a
forest is the best place to do it,

550
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:30,640
wouldn't you say?

551
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:33,320
People would just walk
straight past, not knowing,

552
00:39:33,320 --> 00:39:35,120
unable to decipher the message.

553
00:39:37,120 --> 00:39:39,400
There. I spotted it earlier.

554
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,280
They've been here.
And that's the exact same paint?

555
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:44,280
Yeah.

556
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:46,520
John, if we're going to
decipher this code,

557
00:39:46,520 --> 00:39:48,200
we need to look for more evidence.

558
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:52,080
Answer your phone.
I've been calling you.

559
00:40:52,080 --> 00:40:54,840
PANTING
I found it.

560
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:10,600
It's been painted over.

561
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,320
I don't understand. It was...

562
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:17,440
here.

563
00:41:19,120 --> 00:41:21,000
10 minutes ago. I saw it.

564
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:22,760
A whole load of graffiti.

565
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:24,840
Somebody doesn't want me to see it.

566
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:29,120
Sherlock, what are you doing...?
Ssh! John, concentrate.

567
00:41:29,120 --> 00:41:30,960
I need you to concentrate.
Close your eyes.

568
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:33,480
What? Why? Why? What are you doing?

569
00:41:33,480 --> 00:41:36,160
I need you to maximise
your visual memory.

570
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:38,120
Try to picture what you saw.

571
00:41:38,120 --> 00:41:40,240
Can you picture it? Yeah.

572
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:42,000
Can you remember it?
Yes, definitely.

573
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:43,080
Can you remember the pattern?

574
00:41:43,080 --> 00:41:44,800
Yes. How much can you remember it?

575
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:45,960
Look, don't worry.

576
00:41:45,960 --> 00:41:49,400
Because the average human memory
on visual matters
is only 62% accurate.

577
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:51,680
Well, don't worry,
I remember all of it. Really?

578
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:56,120
At least I would, if I could get
to my pockets. I took a photograph.

579
00:41:56,120 --> 00:41:57,920
MOBILE BEEPS

580
00:42:01,840 --> 00:42:06,320
TRAIN RUMBLES

581
00:42:16,840 --> 00:42:19,120
Always in pairs, John, look.

582
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:21,840
Numbers...

583
00:42:21,840 --> 00:42:23,720
come with partners.

584
00:42:23,720 --> 00:42:25,120
God, I need to sleep.

585
00:42:25,120 --> 00:42:28,240
Why did he paint it
so near the tracks? No idea.

586
00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:30,320
Thousands of people
pass by there every day.

587
00:42:30,320 --> 00:42:32,320
Just 20 minutes...

588
00:42:33,480 --> 00:42:35,320
Of course.

589
00:42:35,320 --> 00:42:37,640
Of course, he wants information.
He's trying to communicate

590
00:42:37,640 --> 00:42:41,880
with his people in the underworld.
Whatever was stolen,
he wants it back.

591
00:42:41,880 --> 00:42:45,520
It's somewhere here, in a code.

592
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:48,800
We can't crack this
without Soo Lin Yao.

593
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:50,760
Oh, good.

594
00:42:50,760 --> 00:42:53,520
Two men who travelled back
from China were murdered.

595
00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:56,640
And their killer left them messages
in Hang Zhou numerals.

596
00:42:56,640 --> 00:42:58,640
Soo Lin Yao is in danger.

597
00:42:58,640 --> 00:43:01,520
That cipher, it was just
the same pattern as the others.

598
00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:03,280
He means to kill her as well.

599
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:05,200
Look, I've tried everywhere -

600
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:07,800
friends, colleagues.
I don't know where she's gone.

601
00:43:07,800 --> 00:43:10,120
I mean, she could be
a thousand miles away.

602
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:15,280
What are you looking at?
Tell me more about those teapots.

603
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:19,800
The pots were her obsession.
They need urgent work.

604
00:43:19,800 --> 00:43:22,160
If they dry out,
then the clay can start to crumble.

605
00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:25,280
Apparently, you have to just
keep making tea in them.

606
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:29,120
Yesterday, only one of those pots
was shining.

607
00:43:29,120 --> 00:43:30,840
Now, there are two.

608
00:43:40,560 --> 00:43:41,560
GRATING

609
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:23,960
Fancy a biscuit with that?

610
00:44:25,800 --> 00:44:28,960
Centuries old.
Don't want to break that.

611
00:44:35,520 --> 00:44:37,480
Hello.

612
00:44:37,480 --> 00:44:39,280
You saw the cipher.

613
00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:42,880
Then you know he is coming for me.

614
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:46,440
You've been clever
to avoid him so far.

615
00:44:46,440 --> 00:44:48,680
I had to finish.

616
00:44:48,680 --> 00:44:50,560
To finish this work.

617
00:44:52,440 --> 00:44:54,640
It's only a matter of time.

618
00:44:54,640 --> 00:44:57,200
I know he will find me.

619
00:44:57,200 --> 00:45:00,120
Who is he?
Have you met him before?

620
00:45:01,640 --> 00:45:05,200
When I was a girl, we met in China.

621
00:45:07,040 --> 00:45:09,640
I recognised his...

622
00:45:09,640 --> 00:45:12,000
signature.
The cipher?

623
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:18,200
Only he would do this. Zhi Zhu.

624
00:45:18,200 --> 00:45:21,760
Zhi Zhu? The spider.

625
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:28,360
You know this mark?

626
00:45:28,360 --> 00:45:31,480
Yes. It's the mark of a Tong.

627
00:45:31,480 --> 00:45:36,080
Huh? Ancient crime syndicate,
based in China.

628
00:45:38,440 --> 00:45:41,080
Every foot soldier bears the mark.

629
00:45:42,560 --> 00:45:44,400
Everyone who hauls for them.

630
00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:46,320
Hauls?

631
00:45:49,280 --> 00:45:50,840
You mean you were a smuggler?

632
00:45:54,920 --> 00:45:56,840
I was 15.

633
00:45:58,760 --> 00:46:00,440
My parents were dead.

634
00:46:01,560 --> 00:46:03,480
I had no livelihood.

635
00:46:04,280 --> 00:46:08,200
No way of surviving, day-to-day,

636
00:46:08,200 --> 00:46:10,200
except to work for the bosses.

637
00:46:10,200 --> 00:46:12,000
Who are they?

638
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:16,040
They are called the Black Lotus.

639
00:46:19,160 --> 00:46:21,400
By the time I was 16,

640
00:46:22,920 --> 00:46:26,560
I was taking
thousands of pounds worth of drugs

641
00:46:26,560 --> 00:46:28,480
across the border into Hong Kong.

642
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:35,360
I managed to leave
that life behind me.

643
00:46:37,240 --> 00:46:39,160
I came to England.

644
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:43,080
They gave me a job, here.

645
00:46:45,960 --> 00:46:49,920
Everything was good. New life.

646
00:46:49,920 --> 00:46:52,720
And he came looking for you.

647
00:46:52,720 --> 00:46:54,200
Yes.

648
00:46:56,680 --> 00:47:00,440
I hoped, after five years...

649
00:47:00,440 --> 00:47:02,560
maybe they would have forgotten me.

650
00:47:03,840 --> 00:47:06,440
But they never really let you leave.

651
00:47:08,840 --> 00:47:11,040
A small community like ours...

652
00:47:12,560 --> 00:47:14,560
..they are never very far away.

653
00:47:20,760 --> 00:47:22,640
He came to my flat.

654
00:47:22,640 --> 00:47:27,280
He asked me to help him to track down
something that was stolen.

655
00:47:27,280 --> 00:47:29,200
And you've no idea what it was?

656
00:47:29,200 --> 00:47:31,480
I refused to help.

657
00:47:31,480 --> 00:47:35,800
So, you knew him well
when you were living back in China?

658
00:47:37,720 --> 00:47:39,560
Oh, yes.

659
00:47:41,240 --> 00:47:43,200
He's my brother.

660
00:47:56,640 --> 00:47:59,360
Two orphans.

661
00:48:01,080 --> 00:48:03,240
We had no choice.

662
00:48:05,240 --> 00:48:10,600
We could work for the Black Lotus,
or starve on the streets, like
beggars.

663
00:48:15,080 --> 00:48:17,720
My brother has become their puppet.

664
00:48:18,960 --> 00:48:23,400
In the power of the one
they call Shan.

665
00:48:23,400 --> 00:48:25,160
The Black Lotus general.

666
00:48:28,520 --> 00:48:30,800
I turned my brother away.

667
00:48:33,080 --> 00:48:35,520
He said I had betrayed him.

668
00:48:38,080 --> 00:48:40,480
Next day, I came to work

669
00:48:40,480 --> 00:48:42,880
and the cipher was waiting.

670
00:48:49,240 --> 00:48:51,080
Can you decipher these?

671
00:48:52,840 --> 00:48:55,520
These are numbers. Yes, I know.

672
00:48:55,520 --> 00:49:00,840
Here, the line across the man's
eyes, it's the Chinese number one.

673
00:49:00,840 --> 00:49:03,600
And this one is 15.
But what's the code?

674
00:49:04,720 --> 00:49:07,160
All the smugglers know it.

675
00:49:07,160 --> 00:49:08,840
It's based upon a book...

676
00:49:08,840 --> 00:49:10,840
DOOR THUDS

677
00:49:13,800 --> 00:49:15,320
He's here.

678
00:49:16,360 --> 00:49:19,840
Zhi Zhu has found me.

679
00:49:19,840 --> 00:49:22,120
No, no, Sherlock.

680
00:49:22,120 --> 00:49:23,160
Sherlock, wait!

681
00:49:23,160 --> 00:49:25,000
Come here.

682
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:26,960
Get in. Get in!

683
00:49:35,880 --> 00:49:37,840
GUNSHOT

684
00:49:37,840 --> 00:49:38,920
SECOND GUNSHOT

685
00:49:38,920 --> 00:49:40,800
MORE GUNSHOTS

686
00:49:42,600 --> 00:49:45,320
I have to go and help him.
Bolt the door after me.

687
00:49:54,800 --> 00:49:56,400
GUNSHOT

688
00:50:13,880 --> 00:50:15,920
GUNSHOTS

689
00:50:17,040 --> 00:50:19,200
Careful!
GUNSHOT

690
00:50:19,200 --> 00:50:23,560
Some of those skulls are over
200,000 years old.
Have a bit of respect.

691
00:50:26,440 --> 00:50:28,400
Thank you.

692
00:51:25,880 --> 00:51:27,400
Liang.

693
00:51:28,920 --> 00:51:31,320
SPEAKS CHINESE

694
00:51:34,640 --> 00:51:37,440
SPEAKS CHINESE

695
00:51:40,240 --> 00:51:42,280
GUNSHOT

696
00:51:43,520 --> 00:51:45,040
Oh, my God.

697
00:52:08,640 --> 00:52:10,520
GULPS

698
00:52:17,480 --> 00:52:19,120
How many murders is it going to take

699
00:52:19,120 --> 00:52:21,840
before you start believing
that this maniac's out there?

700
00:52:21,840 --> 00:52:23,560
MUTTERS

701
00:52:23,560 --> 00:52:25,960
A young girl was gunned down
tonight.

702
00:52:25,960 --> 00:52:29,800
That's three victims in three days.
You're supposed to be finding him.

703
00:52:29,800 --> 00:52:31,160
Brian Lukis and Eddie Van Coon

704
00:52:31,160 --> 00:52:33,520
were working for a gang
of international smugglers.

705
00:52:33,520 --> 00:52:37,080
A gang called the Black Lotus,
operating here in London

706
00:52:37,080 --> 00:52:39,320
right under your nose.

707
00:52:39,320 --> 00:52:40,720
Can you prove that?

708
00:52:48,680 --> 00:52:51,320
What are you thinking?
Pork or pasta? Oh, it's you.

709
00:52:52,320 --> 00:52:55,360
I suppose it's never going
to trouble Egon Ronay, is it?

710
00:52:55,360 --> 00:52:56,920
I'd stick with the pasta.

711
00:52:56,920 --> 00:53:01,200
Don't want to be doing roast pork,
not if you're slicing up cadavers.

712
00:53:01,200 --> 00:53:03,560
What are you having?

713
00:53:03,560 --> 00:53:06,000
I don't eat when I'm working.
Digesting slows me down.

714
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:08,880
So you're working here tonight?

715
00:53:08,880 --> 00:53:10,720
Need to examine some bodies. Some?

716
00:53:10,720 --> 00:53:13,520
Eddie Van Coon and Brian Lukis.

717
00:53:13,520 --> 00:53:15,080
They're on my list.

718
00:53:16,640 --> 00:53:18,960
Could you wheel them out again
for me?

719
00:53:18,960 --> 00:53:23,200
Well...their paperwork's
already gone through.

720
00:53:26,800 --> 00:53:29,960
You changed your hair. What?

721
00:53:29,960 --> 00:53:32,560
The style.
It's usually parted in the middle.

722
00:53:32,560 --> 00:53:34,160
Yes, well...

723
00:53:34,160 --> 00:53:35,400
It's good.

724
00:53:35,400 --> 00:53:37,800
It...suits you better this way.

725
00:53:48,720 --> 00:53:50,520
We're just interested in the feet.

726
00:53:50,520 --> 00:53:52,320
The feet? Yes.

727
00:53:52,320 --> 00:53:54,120
Do you mind if we have
a look at them?

728
00:54:01,840 --> 00:54:03,480
Now, Van Coon.

729
00:54:09,360 --> 00:54:12,800
Oh! So...

730
00:54:12,800 --> 00:54:16,120
So either these two men just
happened to visit the same
Chinese tattoo parlour,

731
00:54:16,120 --> 00:54:19,560
or I'm telling the truth.
What do you want?

732
00:54:19,560 --> 00:54:22,080
I want every book from Lukis'
apartment and Van Coon's.

733
00:54:22,080 --> 00:54:24,320
Their books?

734
00:54:27,600 --> 00:54:31,240
Not just a criminal organisation.
It's a cult.

735
00:54:33,400 --> 00:54:35,720
Her brother was corrupted
by one of its leaders.

736
00:54:35,720 --> 00:54:37,160
Soo Lin said the name.

737
00:54:37,160 --> 00:54:39,920
Yes, Shan. General Shan.

738
00:54:39,920 --> 00:54:41,600
We're still no closer to finding him.

739
00:54:41,600 --> 00:54:43,920
Wrong! We've got almost
all we need to know.

740
00:54:43,920 --> 00:54:47,000
She gave us most of
the missing pieces.

741
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:49,600
Why did he need to visit his sister?

742
00:54:49,600 --> 00:54:52,160
Why did he need her expertise?
She worked at the museum.

743
00:54:52,160 --> 00:54:54,360
Exactly. An expert in antiquities.

744
00:54:55,640 --> 00:54:57,920
Of course, I see.
Valuable antiquities, John.

745
00:54:57,920 --> 00:55:00,760
Ancient Chinese relics
purchased on the black market.

746
00:55:00,760 --> 00:55:04,000
China's home to a thousand treasures
hidden after Mao's revolution.

747
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:05,440
The Black Lotus is selling them.

748
00:55:10,640 --> 00:55:12,960
Check for the dates... Here,

749
00:55:12,960 --> 00:55:15,600
John,
"arrived from China four days ago".

750
00:55:16,480 --> 00:55:18,160
Anonymous.

751
00:55:18,160 --> 00:55:20,640
The vendor doesn't give his name.

752
00:55:20,640 --> 00:55:23,120
"Two undiscovered treasures
from the East."

753
00:55:23,120 --> 00:55:27,640
One in Lukis' suitcase
and one in Van Coon's.

754
00:55:27,640 --> 00:55:29,120
"Antiquities...

755
00:55:29,120 --> 00:55:32,920
"sold at auction."

756
00:55:32,920 --> 00:55:35,280
Look, here's another one.

757
00:55:35,280 --> 00:55:37,000
Arrived from China a month ago,

758
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:40,440
Chinese ceramic statue sold for
£400,000.

759
00:55:40,440 --> 00:55:43,840
Look, a month before that,
Chinese painting, £500,000.

760
00:55:43,840 --> 00:55:46,160
All of them
from an anonymous source.

761
00:55:46,160 --> 00:55:50,120
They're stealing them back in China
and one by one feeding them
into Britain.

762
00:55:53,480 --> 00:55:57,560
Every single auction coincides
with Lukis or Van Coon
travelling to China.

763
00:55:57,560 --> 00:55:59,720
So what if one of them got greedy
when they were in China?

764
00:55:59,720 --> 00:56:01,280
What if one of them stole something?

765
00:56:01,280 --> 00:56:03,600
That's why Zhi Zhu's come.
KNOCK AT DOOR

766
00:56:03,600 --> 00:56:06,760
Sorry, are we collecting
for charity, Sherlock?

767
00:56:06,760 --> 00:56:07,920
What?

768
00:56:07,920 --> 00:56:10,800
A young man's outside
with crates of books.

769
00:56:16,560 --> 00:56:18,360
So the numbers are references.

770
00:56:18,360 --> 00:56:19,760
To books.

771
00:56:19,760 --> 00:56:23,160
To specific pages
and specific words on those pages.

772
00:56:23,160 --> 00:56:25,440
Right, so...

773
00:56:25,440 --> 00:56:27,560
15 and 1, that means?

774
00:56:27,560 --> 00:56:29,760
Turn to page 15
and it's the first word you read.

775
00:56:29,760 --> 00:56:32,160
OK, so what's the message?
Depends on the book.

776
00:56:32,160 --> 00:56:35,080
That's the cunning of the book code.

777
00:56:35,080 --> 00:56:37,040
It has to be one that they both own.

778
00:56:40,720 --> 00:56:44,840
OK, fine. This shouldn't take
too long, should it(?)

779
00:56:57,320 --> 00:57:01,600
We found these...at the museum.
Is this your writing?

780
00:57:01,600 --> 00:57:05,200
Er, we hoped Soo Lin
could decipher it for us.

781
00:57:05,200 --> 00:57:07,160
Ta.

782
00:57:07,160 --> 00:57:09,720
Anything else I can do?

783
00:57:09,720 --> 00:57:11,880
To assist you, I mean.

784
00:57:11,880 --> 00:57:14,240
Some silence right now
would be marvellous.

785
00:57:28,920 --> 00:57:31,280
Cigarette.

786
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:01,280
Imagine.

787
00:58:04,640 --> 00:58:06,800
CLOCK TICKS

788
00:58:12,280 --> 00:58:14,720
WATCH BLEEPS

789
00:58:14,720 --> 00:58:16,160
Oh...

790
00:58:17,400 --> 00:58:19,760
CHURCH BELLS RING

791
00:58:21,160 --> 00:58:22,680
I'm sorry to keep you waiting,

792
00:58:22,680 --> 00:58:26,480
but we haven't got anything now
until next Thursday.

793
00:58:26,480 --> 00:58:29,320
WOMAN: This is taking ages.

794
00:58:29,320 --> 00:58:30,680
Sorry.

795
00:58:30,680 --> 00:58:34,040
WOMAN: What's the point of booking
an appointment if they
can't stick to it?

796
00:58:34,040 --> 00:58:35,680
Um, what's going on?

797
00:58:35,680 --> 00:58:40,840
That new doctor you hired, he
hasn't buzzed the intercom for ages.

798
00:58:40,840 --> 00:58:43,600
Let me go and have a word.

799
00:58:43,600 --> 00:58:46,440
Excuse me. Sorry.

800
00:58:46,440 --> 00:58:48,960
KNOCKS ON DOOR
John?

801
00:58:51,480 --> 00:58:53,240
John?

802
00:58:58,680 --> 00:59:01,400
GENTLE SNORING

803
00:59:03,680 --> 00:59:07,560
Looks like I'm done.
I thought I had some more to see.

804
00:59:07,560 --> 00:59:10,640
Oh, I did one or two of yours.
One or two?

805
00:59:10,640 --> 00:59:13,920
Well, maybe five or six.

806
00:59:13,920 --> 00:59:16,280
I'm sorry,
that's not very professional.

807
00:59:16,280 --> 00:59:18,920
No, not really.

808
00:59:18,920 --> 00:59:21,400
I had...a bit of a late one.

809
00:59:22,680 --> 00:59:25,160
Oh, right.

810
00:59:26,280 --> 00:59:27,600
Anyway, see you.

811
00:59:27,600 --> 00:59:32,480
So...what were you doing
to keep you up so late?

812
00:59:32,480 --> 00:59:35,440
I was attending
a sort of book event.

813
00:59:35,440 --> 00:59:39,600
Oh. Oh, she likes books,
does she, your girlfriend?

814
00:59:39,600 --> 00:59:41,480
No, it wasn't a date.

815
00:59:41,480 --> 00:59:45,480
Good. I mean, I'm...
And I don't have one tonight.

816
00:59:48,160 --> 00:59:50,400
A book that everybody would own.

817
01:00:00,960 --> 01:00:03,280
15, entry 1.

818
01:00:16,520 --> 01:00:19,560
I need to get some air.
We're going out tonight.

819
01:00:19,560 --> 01:00:21,680
Actually, I've got a date. What?

820
01:00:21,680 --> 01:00:23,840
Where two people who like each other
go out and have fun?

821
01:00:23,840 --> 01:00:25,480
That's what I was suggesting.

822
01:00:25,480 --> 01:00:28,480
No, it wasn't. At least, I hope not.

823
01:00:28,480 --> 01:00:30,080
Where are you taking her?

824
01:00:30,080 --> 01:00:31,640
Er, cinema.

825
01:00:31,640 --> 01:00:33,640
Dull, boring, predictable...

826
01:00:33,640 --> 01:00:35,920
Why don't you try this?

827
01:00:35,920 --> 01:00:38,800
In London for one night only.

828
01:00:38,800 --> 01:00:40,320
LAUGHS NERVOUSLY

829
01:00:40,320 --> 01:00:42,440
Thanks, but I don't come to you
for dating advice.

830
01:00:42,440 --> 01:00:45,640
SARAH: It's years since anyone
took me to the circus.

831
01:00:45,640 --> 01:00:47,880
Right, yes.

832
01:00:47,880 --> 01:00:52,000
A friend recommended it to me
and I phoned up.

833
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:54,080
Oh! What are they,
a touring company or something?

834
01:00:54,080 --> 01:00:55,800
I don't know much about it.

835
01:00:55,800 --> 01:00:58,680
I think they're probably from China.

836
01:00:58,680 --> 01:01:02,040
I think so, yes.
There's a coincidence(!)

837
01:01:02,040 --> 01:01:04,440
That's wonderful,
thank you very much.

838
01:01:05,720 --> 01:01:08,600
Hi, I have two tickets
reserved for tonight.

839
01:01:08,600 --> 01:01:10,800
And what's the name? Holmes.

840
01:01:13,640 --> 01:01:16,560
Actually, I have three in that name.

841
01:01:16,560 --> 01:01:19,080
No, I don't think so,
we only booked two.

842
01:01:19,080 --> 01:01:22,640
Then I phoned back
and got one for myself as well.

843
01:01:22,640 --> 01:01:24,720
I'm Sherlock.

844
01:01:26,880 --> 01:01:29,600
Hi. Hello.

845
01:01:31,800 --> 01:01:34,600
You couldn't let me have
just one night off.

846
01:01:34,600 --> 01:01:38,120
Yellow Dragon Circus,
in London for one day. It fits.

847
01:01:38,120 --> 01:01:39,840
The Tong sent an assassin
to England...

848
01:01:39,840 --> 01:01:42,120
Dressed as a tightrope walker.
Come on, Sherlock, behave!

849
01:01:42,120 --> 01:01:44,200
We're looking for a killer who can
climb, who can shin up a rope.

850
01:01:44,200 --> 01:01:46,920
Where else would you find
that level of dexterity?

851
01:01:46,920 --> 01:01:49,200
Exit visas are scarce in China.

852
01:01:49,200 --> 01:01:51,120
They need a good reason
to get out of that country.

853
01:01:51,120 --> 01:01:52,920
All I need to do
is have a quick look around...

854
01:01:52,920 --> 01:01:54,720
Fine. You do that,
I'll take Sarah for a pint.

855
01:01:54,720 --> 01:01:56,000
I need your help.

856
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:57,760
I do have a couple of other things
on my mind this evening.

857
01:01:57,760 --> 01:02:00,000
Like what?

858
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:03,040
You are kidding?
What's so important?

859
01:02:03,040 --> 01:02:04,880
Sherlock,
I'm in the middle of a date.

860
01:02:04,880 --> 01:02:06,880
You're going to chase some killer
while I'm trying to...

861
01:02:06,880 --> 01:02:08,960
What?

862
01:02:08,960 --> 01:02:11,080
While I'm trying to get off
with Sarah.

863
01:02:11,080 --> 01:02:13,720
Hey... Ready?

864
01:02:13,720 --> 01:02:15,200
Yeah.

865
01:02:17,840 --> 01:02:19,440
MURMUR OF CONVERSATION

866
01:02:24,320 --> 01:02:27,640
You said circus.
This is not a circus.

867
01:02:27,640 --> 01:02:29,080
Look at the size of this crowd.

868
01:02:29,080 --> 01:02:31,560
Sherlock, this is...art.

869
01:02:31,560 --> 01:02:34,160
This is not their day job.

870
01:02:34,160 --> 01:02:38,640
Sorry, I forgot, they're not
a circus, they're a gang
of international smugglers.

871
01:02:57,440 --> 01:02:59,720
LOUDER DRUM BEAT

872
01:03:49,040 --> 01:03:51,760
WHOOSH
AUDIENCE GASPS

873
01:03:53,920 --> 01:03:55,960
APPLAUSE

874
01:04:11,120 --> 01:04:13,840
Classic Chinese escapology act.

875
01:04:13,840 --> 01:04:17,040
Hm?
The crossbow's on a delicate string.

876
01:04:17,040 --> 01:04:20,320
The warrior has to escape his bonds
before it fires.

877
01:04:27,640 --> 01:04:28,640
HE SHOUTS

878
01:04:36,280 --> 01:04:39,080
DRUM BEAT QUICKENS

879
01:04:41,080 --> 01:04:43,120
GONG
Oh!

880
01:04:43,120 --> 01:04:45,000
THEY LAUGH

881
01:04:55,160 --> 01:04:58,200
She splits the sandbag,
the sand pours out.

882
01:04:58,200 --> 01:05:01,080
Gradually,
the weight lowers into the bowl.

883
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:07,960
ESCAPOLOGIST SHOUTS AND STRAINS

884
01:05:39,720 --> 01:05:40,920
APPLAUSE

885
01:05:40,920 --> 01:05:42,880
Thank God. My God!

886
01:06:02,080 --> 01:06:05,120
APPLAUSE RESTARTS

887
01:06:14,320 --> 01:06:16,800
Ladies and gentlemen.

888
01:06:16,800 --> 01:06:21,440
From the distant moonlit shores
of the Yangtze River,

889
01:06:21,440 --> 01:06:24,520
we present, for your pleasure,

890
01:06:24,520 --> 01:06:28,800
the deadly Chinese bird spider.

891
01:06:31,080 --> 01:06:32,080
APPLAUSE

892
01:06:37,680 --> 01:06:39,240
Did you see that?

893
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:04,280
Well, well.

894
01:07:05,360 --> 01:07:07,240
DOOR OPENS

895
01:07:14,520 --> 01:07:17,760
COAT HANGERS RATTLE

896
01:07:23,120 --> 01:07:25,560
DOOR OPENS AND CLOSES

897
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:34,520
Found you.

898
01:08:39,880 --> 01:08:42,760
Come on.
Come on. Let's go!

899
01:08:42,760 --> 01:08:46,640
I sent a couple of cars.
The old hall is totally deserted.

900
01:08:46,640 --> 01:08:50,000
Look, I saw the mark at the circus.
The tattoo that we saw

901
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:51,840
on the two bodies,
the mark of the Tong.

902
01:08:51,840 --> 01:08:55,360
Lukis and Van Coon were part of
a smuggling operation.

903
01:08:55,360 --> 01:08:57,880
One of them stole something
in China. Something valuable.

904
01:08:57,880 --> 01:08:59,040
The circus performers
were gang members

905
01:08:59,040 --> 01:09:01,200
sent here to get it back.
Get what back?

906
01:09:02,480 --> 01:09:04,120
We don't know.

907
01:09:04,120 --> 01:09:05,800
You don't know?

908
01:09:07,360 --> 01:09:10,840
Mr Holmes,
I've done everything you asked.

909
01:09:10,840 --> 01:09:14,640
Lestrade, he seems to think
your advice is worth something.

910
01:09:14,640 --> 01:09:15,920
I gave the order for a raid.

911
01:09:15,920 --> 01:09:18,120
Please tell me I'll have something
to show for it.

912
01:09:18,120 --> 01:09:20,960
Other than a massive bill
for overtime.

913
01:09:25,600 --> 01:09:27,240
They'll be back in China by tomorrow.

914
01:09:27,240 --> 01:09:29,920
No, they won't leave
without what they came for.

915
01:09:29,920 --> 01:09:31,840
We need to find a hideout.

916
01:09:31,840 --> 01:09:33,360
A rendezvous.

917
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:37,640
Somewhere in this message
it must tell us.

918
01:09:41,560 --> 01:09:44,120
Well, I think
perhaps I should leave you to it.

919
01:09:44,120 --> 01:09:47,600
No, you don't have to go. Stay.
Yes, it'd be better if you left now.

920
01:09:47,600 --> 01:09:51,160
He's kidding.
Please stay if you'd like.

921
01:09:51,160 --> 01:09:53,200
Is it just me
or is anyone else starving?

922
01:09:53,200 --> 01:09:54,640
Oh, God.

923
01:10:08,120 --> 01:10:10,120
So this is what you do.

924
01:10:10,120 --> 01:10:12,960
You and John,
you solve puzzles for a living.

925
01:10:12,960 --> 01:10:15,400
Consulting detective.

926
01:10:15,400 --> 01:10:17,440
Oh.

927
01:10:18,720 --> 01:10:20,040
Oh!

928
01:10:23,600 --> 01:10:25,360
What are these squiggles?

929
01:10:25,360 --> 01:10:28,360
They're numbers.
An ancient Chinese dialect.

930
01:10:28,360 --> 01:10:32,680
Oh, right. Well, of course
I should have known that.

931
01:10:38,240 --> 01:10:41,760
(I've done punch
and a bowl of nibbles.)

932
01:10:41,760 --> 01:10:43,680
Mrs Hudson, you are a saint.

933
01:10:43,680 --> 01:10:46,080
If it was Monday,
I'd have been to the supermarket.

934
01:10:46,080 --> 01:10:47,640
Thank you. Thank you.

935
01:10:47,640 --> 01:10:49,480
SIRENS PASS BY

936
01:10:54,760 --> 01:10:57,400
So these numbers, it's a cipher?
Exactly.

937
01:10:57,400 --> 01:10:58,800
And each pair of numbers is a word?

938
01:11:00,720 --> 01:11:01,800
How did you know that?

939
01:11:01,800 --> 01:11:04,520
Well, two words
have already been translated. Here.

940
01:11:06,600 --> 01:11:09,320
John. Mmm?

941
01:11:09,320 --> 01:11:10,320
John, look at this.

942
01:11:12,200 --> 01:11:15,760
Soo Lin at the museum, she started
to translate the code for us.

943
01:11:15,760 --> 01:11:17,440
We didn't see it.

944
01:11:17,440 --> 01:11:19,520
Nine mill.

945
01:11:21,920 --> 01:11:22,960
Does that mean millions?

946
01:11:22,960 --> 01:11:26,000
Nine million quid. For what?

947
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:29,120
We need to know
the end of this sentence.

948
01:11:29,120 --> 01:11:30,680
Where are you going?

949
01:11:30,680 --> 01:11:34,480
To the museum, to the restoration
room. We must have been
staring right at it. At what?

950
01:11:34,480 --> 01:11:37,400
The book, John. The book.
The key to cracking the cipher.

951
01:11:37,400 --> 01:11:40,520
Soo Lin used it to do this. Whilst
we were running around the gallery,

952
01:11:40,520 --> 01:11:44,040
she started to translate the code.
It must be on her desk.

953
01:11:45,760 --> 01:11:47,200
Taxi!

954
01:11:47,200 --> 01:11:48,640
ANGRY VOICE

955
01:11:48,640 --> 01:11:50,320
Entschuldigen Sie, bitte.

956
01:11:50,320 --> 01:11:52,320
Ja, danke(!)

957
01:11:52,320 --> 01:11:54,080
THEY MUTTER

958
01:12:04,560 --> 01:12:06,480
INAUDIBLE

959
01:12:15,680 --> 01:12:18,280
A book that everybody would own.

960
01:12:21,120 --> 01:12:23,080
Please, wait!

961
01:12:23,080 --> 01:12:24,760
Bitte!

962
01:12:25,880 --> 01:12:28,840
Was wollt er?

963
01:12:28,840 --> 01:12:30,480
Hey, du, was machst du?

964
01:12:30,480 --> 01:12:32,680
Minute!
Gib mir doch mein Buch zuruck!

965
01:12:35,360 --> 01:12:37,000
Yeah. No, absolutely.

966
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:40,040
I mean, a quiet night in
is just what the doctor ordered.

967
01:12:41,840 --> 01:12:46,960
I mean, I love to go out of an
evening and wrestle a few Chinese
gangsters generally,

968
01:12:46,960 --> 01:12:49,080
but a girl can get too much. OK.

969
01:12:52,720 --> 01:12:55,360
Er, shall we get a takeaway?

970
01:12:55,360 --> 01:12:56,920
Yeah.

971
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:00,120
Page 15, entry 1...

972
01:13:00,120 --> 01:13:02,200
Page 15, entry 1.

973
01:13:05,240 --> 01:13:07,240
Dead man.

974
01:13:07,240 --> 01:13:09,960
You were threatening to kill them.

975
01:13:09,960 --> 01:13:11,680
That's the first cipher.

976
01:13:14,840 --> 01:13:18,400
9... 0... 15...

977
01:13:18,400 --> 01:13:19,840
er, 15 and 36.

978
01:13:19,840 --> 01:13:23,040
36, 39, 39...

979
01:13:23,040 --> 01:13:24,800
39...

980
01:13:24,800 --> 01:13:26,280
9...

981
01:13:30,200 --> 01:13:34,160
"Nine", "mill", "for"...

982
01:13:42,880 --> 01:13:44,840
KNOCK AT DOOR

983
01:13:44,840 --> 01:13:47,200
Blimey, that was quick.
I'll just pop down.

984
01:13:47,200 --> 01:13:49,840
Do you want me to lay the table?

985
01:13:49,840 --> 01:13:52,920
Um...eat off trays? Yeah.

986
01:13:55,240 --> 01:13:57,720
70...35...

987
01:14:01,080 --> 01:14:02,360
Jade...

988
01:14:02,360 --> 01:14:04,320
Jade.

989
01:14:06,760 --> 01:14:08,840
Sorry to keep you.
How much do you want?

990
01:14:08,840 --> 01:14:10,520
Do you have it? What?

991
01:14:10,520 --> 01:14:14,080
Do you have the treasure?
I don't understand.

992
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:20,800
MUTTERS

993
01:14:26,880 --> 01:14:31,720
"Nine mill for Jade pin.

01:14:31,720 --> 01:14:33,680

"tramway."

996
01:14:41,440 --> 01:14:43,760
DOOR SHUTS

997
01:14:46,360 --> 01:14:48,600
HOLMES: John! John, I've got it.

998
01:14:48,600 --> 01:14:52,480
The cipher, the book. It's the
London A-Z that they're us...

999
01:15:08,640 --> 01:15:13,560
WOMAN: A book is like
a magic garden,

1000
01:15:13,560 --> 01:15:15,960
carried in your pocket.

1001
01:15:29,560 --> 01:15:33,920
Chinese proverb, Mr Holmes.
I'm...

1002
01:15:33,920 --> 01:15:35,480
I'm not Sherlock Holmes.

1003
01:15:35,480 --> 01:15:39,000
Forgive me
if I do not take your word for it.

1004
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:41,480
Ow!

1005
01:15:45,160 --> 01:15:46,680
Debit card, name of...

1006
01:15:46,680 --> 01:15:47,840
S Holmes.

1007
01:15:47,840 --> 01:15:48,960
Take my card.

1008
01:15:48,960 --> 01:15:52,080
Yes, that's not actually mine.
He lent that to me.

1009
01:15:52,080 --> 01:15:58,040
And a cheque for £5,000 made out
in the name of Mr Sherlock Holmes.

1010
01:15:58,040 --> 01:16:01,480
Yeah, he gave me that to look after.

1011
01:16:01,480 --> 01:16:05,480
Tickets from the theatre
collected by you, name of Holmes.

1012
01:16:05,480 --> 01:16:06,720
Yes, OK.

1013
01:16:06,720 --> 01:16:08,160
What's the name?
Er, Holmes.

1014
01:16:08,160 --> 01:16:10,000
I realise what this looks like.

1015
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:11,640
But I'm not him.

1016
01:16:11,640 --> 01:16:15,280
We heard it from your own mouth.
What?

1017
01:16:15,280 --> 01:16:19,360
"I am Sherlock Holmes
and I always work alone."

1018
01:16:19,360 --> 01:16:22,400
Because no-one else can compete with
my massive intellect.

1019
01:16:22,400 --> 01:16:24,560
Did I really say that?

1020
01:16:27,760 --> 01:16:32,720
I suppose there's no use me trying
to persuade you I was doing
an impression.

1021
01:16:34,360 --> 01:16:36,200
I am Shan.

1022
01:16:38,080 --> 01:16:40,960
You're... You're Shan?

1023
01:16:40,960 --> 01:16:44,360
Three times we tried to kill you
and your companion, Mr Holmes.

1024
01:16:44,360 --> 01:16:48,000
What does it tell you when an
assassin cannot shoot straight?

1025
01:16:49,360 --> 01:16:50,600
GUN COCKS

1026
01:17:00,760 --> 01:17:03,000
GUN CLICKS

1027
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:06,320
It tells you
that they're not really trying.

1028
01:17:07,880 --> 01:17:09,720
Tramway.

1029
01:17:26,080 --> 01:17:27,840
There.

1030
01:17:31,080 --> 01:17:35,120
Not blank bullets now. OK.

1031
01:17:35,120 --> 01:17:38,160
If we wanted to kill you, Mr Holmes,
we would have done it by now.

1032
01:17:38,160 --> 01:17:40,960
We just wanted to
make you inquisitive.

1033
01:17:42,760 --> 01:17:45,840
Do you have it?
Do I have what?

1034
01:17:45,840 --> 01:17:49,360
The treasure. I don't know
what you're talking about.

1035
01:17:49,360 --> 01:17:52,440
I would prefer to make certain.

1036
01:17:57,360 --> 01:18:00,080
Everything in the West
has its price.

1037
01:18:00,080 --> 01:18:04,960
And the price for her life -
information.

1038
01:18:08,280 --> 01:18:11,080
SARAH GROANS

1039
01:18:11,080 --> 01:18:14,280
(I'm sorry. I'm sorry.)

1040
01:18:28,720 --> 01:18:31,520
Where's the hairpin? What?

1041
01:18:31,520 --> 01:18:35,440
The Empress pin
valued at £9 million sterling?

1042
01:18:35,440 --> 01:18:37,720
We already had a buyer in the West

1043
01:18:37,720 --> 01:18:39,960
and then one of our people
was greedy, he took it,

1044
01:18:39,960 --> 01:18:43,240
brought it back to London, and you,
Mr Holmes, have been searching.

1045
01:18:43,240 --> 01:18:46,520
Please, please. Listen to me.
I'm not...

1046
01:18:46,520 --> 01:18:49,840
I'm not Sherlock Holmes.
You have to believe me.

1047
01:18:49,840 --> 01:18:51,680
I haven't found whatever it is
you're looking for.

1048
01:18:51,680 --> 01:18:55,800
I need a volunteer from
the audience. No, please, please!

1049
01:18:55,800 --> 01:18:58,320
Ah, thank you, lady.

1050
01:18:58,320 --> 01:19:02,480
Yes, you'll do very nicely.

1051
01:19:02,480 --> 01:19:04,480
MUFFLED GROANS

1052
01:19:23,520 --> 01:19:30,960
Ladies and gentlemen, from the
distant, moonlit shores of NW1,

1053
01:19:30,960 --> 01:19:34,640
we present for your pleasure,

1054
01:19:34,640 --> 01:19:40,680
Sherlock Holmes' pretty companion
in a death-defying act. Please!

1055
01:19:43,880 --> 01:19:48,520
You've seen the act before.
How dull for you.

1056
01:19:48,520 --> 01:19:50,080
You know how it ends.

1057
01:19:50,080 --> 01:19:52,000
I'm not Sherlock Holmes!

1058
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:53,520
I don't believe you.

1059
01:19:53,520 --> 01:19:55,440
You should, you know.

1060
01:19:55,440 --> 01:19:58,480
Sherlock Holmes
is nothing at all like him.

1061
01:19:58,480 --> 01:20:02,040
How would you describe me, John?

1062
01:20:02,040 --> 01:20:05,920
Resourceful? Dynamic? Enigmatic?
Late?

1063
01:20:05,920 --> 01:20:07,480
That's a semi-automatic.
If you fire it,

1064
01:20:07,480 --> 01:20:10,320
the bullet will travel at
over 1,000 metres per second.

1065
01:20:10,320 --> 01:20:11,840
Well?

1066
01:20:11,840 --> 01:20:14,200
Well...
THUMP

1067
01:20:14,200 --> 01:20:16,400
..the radius curvature of these
walls is nearly four metres.

1068
01:20:16,400 --> 01:20:17,680
If you miss,
the bullet will ricochet.

1069
01:20:17,680 --> 01:20:19,360
Could hit anyone.

1070
01:20:19,360 --> 01:20:22,280
Might even bounce off the tunnel
and hit you.

1071
01:21:20,040 --> 01:21:21,840
WHOOSH
THUMP

1072
01:21:22,920 --> 01:21:26,280
GROANS

1073
01:21:35,160 --> 01:21:37,080
FOOTSTEPS RECEDE

1074
01:21:42,600 --> 01:21:43,920
It's all right.

1075
01:21:43,920 --> 01:21:46,080
GRUNTS

1076
01:21:46,080 --> 01:21:48,400
You're going to be all right.
It's over now.

1077
01:21:54,520 --> 01:21:57,000
Don't worry.

1078
01:21:57,000 --> 01:21:59,040
Next date won't be like this.

1079
01:22:13,080 --> 01:22:15,480
We'll just slip off. No need
to mention us in your report.

1080
01:22:15,480 --> 01:22:18,600
Mr Holmes... I have high hopes
for you, Inspector.

1081
01:22:18,600 --> 01:22:20,920
A glittering career.

1082
01:22:20,920 --> 01:22:22,960
I go where you point me.

1083
01:22:25,000 --> 01:22:26,480
Exactly.

1084
01:22:30,960 --> 01:22:33,000
POURING LIQUID

1085
01:22:33,000 --> 01:22:35,680
WATSON: Ta.

1086
01:22:35,680 --> 01:22:37,440
So, nine million. Million.

1087
01:22:37,440 --> 01:22:42,800
Million, yes. Nine million for
Jade pin dragon den black tramway.

1088
01:22:42,800 --> 01:22:45,280
An instruction
to all their London operatives.

1089
01:22:45,280 --> 01:22:47,960
A message.
What they were trying to reclaim.

1090
01:22:47,960 --> 01:22:49,800
What, a jade pin?
Worth £9 million.

1091
01:22:49,800 --> 01:22:52,120
Bring it to the Tramway,
their London hideout.

1092
01:22:52,120 --> 01:22:54,720
Hang on. A hairpin worth £9 million?

1093
01:22:54,720 --> 01:22:56,960
Apparently. Why so much?

1094
01:22:56,960 --> 01:22:59,120
Depends who owned it.

1095
01:23:04,760 --> 01:23:07,080
Two operatives based in London.

1096
01:23:07,080 --> 01:23:09,960
They travel over to Dalian
to smuggle those vases.

1097
01:23:09,960 --> 01:23:13,320
One of them helps himself
to something, a little hairpin.

1098
01:23:13,320 --> 01:23:15,800
Worth £9 million.
Eddie Van Coon was the thief,

1099
01:23:15,800 --> 01:23:17,800
he stole the treasure
when he was in China.

1100
01:23:17,800 --> 01:23:19,480
How do you know it was Van Coon,
not Lukis?

1101
01:23:19,480 --> 01:23:22,560
Even the killer didn't know that.
Because of the soap.

1102
01:23:30,560 --> 01:23:32,560
PHONE RINGS

1103
01:23:34,520 --> 01:23:37,080
Amanda?
HOLMES: He brought you a present.

1104
01:23:37,080 --> 01:23:38,560
Oh, hello.

1105
01:23:38,560 --> 01:23:41,240
A little gift
when he came back from China.

1106
01:23:41,240 --> 01:23:45,640
How do you know that?
You weren't just his PA, were you?

1107
01:23:45,640 --> 01:23:47,240
Someone's been gossiping.

1108
01:23:47,240 --> 01:23:49,080
No. Then I don't understand why...

1109
01:23:49,080 --> 01:23:51,040
Scented hand soap in his apartment.

1110
01:23:51,040 --> 01:23:54,480
300ml of it. Bottle almost finished.

1111
01:23:54,480 --> 01:23:59,480
Sorry...? I don't think Eddie
Van Coon was the type of chap
to buy himself hand soap,

1112
01:23:59,480 --> 01:24:01,600
not unless he had
a lady coming over.

1113
01:24:01,600 --> 01:24:04,200
And it's the same brand as that
hand cream there on your desk.

1114
01:24:06,320 --> 01:24:09,840
Look, it wasn't serious between us.

1115
01:24:09,840 --> 01:24:14,440
It was over in a flash,
it couldn't last. He was my boss.

1116
01:24:14,440 --> 01:24:17,040
What happened? Why did you end it?

1117
01:24:19,280 --> 01:24:22,040
I thought he didn't appreciate me.

1118
01:24:22,040 --> 01:24:23,840
Took me for granted.

1119
01:24:25,400 --> 01:24:27,160
Stood me up once too often.

1120
01:24:27,160 --> 01:24:30,960
We'd plan to go away for the weekend,
and then he'd just leave.

1121
01:24:30,960 --> 01:24:33,720
Fly off to China
at a moment's notice.

1122
01:24:33,720 --> 01:24:35,960
And he brought you a present
from abroad to say sorry.

1123
01:24:37,400 --> 01:24:40,680
Can I just have a look at it?

1124
01:24:46,600 --> 01:24:49,640
He really climbed up
onto the balcony?

1125
01:24:49,640 --> 01:24:52,720
Nail a plank across the window
and all your problems are over.

1126
01:24:55,040 --> 01:24:56,640
Thanks.

1127
01:24:56,640 --> 01:25:00,080
He said he bought it
in a street market.

1128
01:25:00,080 --> 01:25:03,000
Oh, I don't think that's true.
I think he pinched it.

1129
01:25:03,000 --> 01:25:04,520
Yeah, that's Eddie.

1130
01:25:04,520 --> 01:25:06,960
Didn't know its value,
just thought it would suit you.

1131
01:25:06,960 --> 01:25:09,880
Oh? What's it worth?

1132
01:25:11,440 --> 01:25:14,080
£9 million.

1133
01:25:17,080 --> 01:25:18,320
Oh, my God.

1134
01:25:18,320 --> 01:25:19,880
Oh, my God!

1135
01:25:22,640 --> 01:25:24,000
Nine million?!

1136
01:25:36,720 --> 01:25:38,680
Over 1,000 years old

1137
01:25:38,680 --> 01:25:40,840
and it's sitting on her bedside table
every night.

1138
01:25:40,840 --> 01:25:43,880
He didn't know its value. Didn't
know why they were chasing him.

1139
01:25:45,440 --> 01:25:48,120
Should've just got her a lucky cat.

1140
01:25:51,400 --> 01:25:54,520
You mind, don't you? What?

1141
01:25:54,520 --> 01:25:57,480
That she escaped. General Shan.

1142
01:25:57,480 --> 01:25:59,440
It's not enough
that we got her two henchmen.

1143
01:25:59,440 --> 01:26:01,240
Must be a vast network, John.

1144
01:26:01,240 --> 01:26:03,000
Thousands of operatives.

1145
01:26:03,000 --> 01:26:05,520
You and I,
we barely scratched the surface.

1146
01:26:05,520 --> 01:26:07,640
You cracked the code though,
Sherlock.

1147
01:26:07,640 --> 01:26:10,480
And maybe Dimmock can track down
all of them now he knows it.

1148
01:26:10,480 --> 01:26:14,920
No. No, I crack this code,

1149
01:26:14,920 --> 01:26:19,000
all the smugglers have to do
is pick up another book.

1150
01:26:39,520 --> 01:26:41,960
SIREN BLARES

1151
01:26:44,320 --> 01:26:47,080
Without you...

1152
01:26:47,080 --> 01:26:50,080
without your assistance,

1153
01:26:50,080 --> 01:26:53,360
we would not have found
passage into London.

1154
01:26:56,800 --> 01:26:58,800
You have my thanks.

1155
01:27:09,760 --> 01:27:11,640
We did not anticipate...

1156
01:27:13,360 --> 01:27:16,240
We did not know this man would come.

1157
01:27:18,320 --> 01:27:20,760
This Sherlock Holmes.

1158
01:27:24,160 --> 01:27:27,840
And now your safety is compromised.

1159
01:27:37,600 --> 01:27:40,240
I will not reveal your identity.

1160
