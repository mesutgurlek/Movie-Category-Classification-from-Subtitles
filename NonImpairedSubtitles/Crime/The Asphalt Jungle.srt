00:02:53,656 --> 00:02:54,884
Gus.

11
00:02:55,058 --> 00:02:57,959
- What time this punk come in?
- I don't watch the clock.

12
00:02:58,127 --> 00:03:00,118
- I own the joint.
- No gun.

13
00:03:00,296 --> 00:03:01,558
I'll search the joint.

14
00:03:01,731 --> 00:03:04,529
- You got a warrant?
- Look, why don't you cooperate.

15
00:03:04,701 --> 00:03:06,896
- Get a warrant.
- Take him in.

16
00:03:07,070 --> 00:03:08,970
- On what?
- We'll book him on vag.

17
00:03:09,138 --> 00:03:11,106
All right. Come on, you.

18
00:03:13,209 --> 00:03:14,733
Come on.

Arrested 1940, released 1941.

30
00:04:12,168 --> 00:04:13,795
That's enough.

31
00:04:14,904 --> 00:04:18,362
Well, do you see the man
who pulled the stickup last night?

32
00:04:18,541 --> 00:04:21,977
- I don't know.
- What do you mean, you don't know?

33
00:04:22,145 --> 00:04:24,375
He had a hat on.

34
00:04:24,547 --> 00:04:25,775
Put on your hats.

35
00:04:30,687 --> 00:04:32,154
Well?

36
00:04:34,090 --> 00:04:37,548
He was tall, you say. He had on
a brown suit and a wide-brim hat.

37
00:04:37,727 --> 00:04:39,922
All right. Don't you see him?

38
00:04:44,267 --> 00:04:46,565
Well, come on. Is that him?

39
00:04:47,937 --> 00:04:50,269
No, it isn't him.

40
00:04:59,849 --> 00:05:02,647
- Okay.
- That's all.

41
00:05:06,689 --> 00:05:11,149
Lieutenant Ditrich, commissioner
wants to see you in his office right away.

42
00:05:26,242 --> 00:05:27,470
Sit down, lieutenant.

43
00:05:28,411 --> 00:05:30,345
Thank you, sir.

44
00:05:35,485 --> 00:05:39,546
Thirty-nine thefts, 33 burglaries,
18 robberies, seven assaults...

45
00:05:39,722 --> 00:05:42,953
...five morals offenses
in the past 30 days.

46
00:05:43,126 --> 00:05:45,594
Quite a record,
even for the 4th Precinct.

47
00:05:45,762 --> 00:05:48,822
We know the guy who's been pulling
most of the stickups.

48
00:05:48,998 --> 00:05:50,693
Name's Dix Handley.

49
00:05:50,867 --> 00:05:55,270
He was in the show-up this morning, but
our witness got cold feet and backed down.

50
00:05:55,438 --> 00:05:58,066
- What can you do?
- Lock up the witness! Scare him worse!

51
00:05:58,241 --> 00:05:59,868
It's your job, knowing what to do.

52
00:06:00,810 --> 00:06:03,574
The only merchants
safe from harm in your precinct...

53
00:06:03,746 --> 00:06:05,714
...are those who take wagers
on the horses.

54
00:06:05,882 --> 00:06:08,214
I wanna know why those
parlors are still operating.

55
00:06:08,384 --> 00:06:10,614
I close them down,
but they open up again.

56
00:06:10,787 --> 00:06:14,416
You don't close them hard enough.
Rip out the phones, smash up the furniture!

57
00:06:14,590 --> 00:06:17,491
People like to bet the horses,
and just because the law says...

58
00:06:17,660 --> 00:06:20,595
I don't want your opinion of the law.

59
00:06:29,172 --> 00:06:32,164
- Is that all, sir?
- No, that's not all.

60
00:06:32,942 --> 00:06:36,400
- Where's Erwin Riedenschneider?
- I'm waiting to hear on that, sir.

61
00:06:36,579 --> 00:06:38,171
You don't know where he is, do you?

62
00:06:38,347 --> 00:06:40,872
No, but we ought to get
a word from our stoolies.

63
00:06:41,050 --> 00:06:43,109
It was all dumped in your lap.

64
00:06:43,286 --> 00:06:48,314
He left prison yesterday at 12 noon, took
a train for this city, time of arrival, 3:17.

65
00:06:48,891 --> 00:06:51,416
All you had to do was stay with him
for 24 hours.

66
00:06:51,594 --> 00:06:54,620
If he didn't register, lock him up.
What happens?

67
00:06:54,797 --> 00:06:58,358
He loses you five blocks from the depot,
and a dangerous criminal...

68
00:06:58,534 --> 00:07:00,001
...is at large in this city.

69
00:07:00,236 --> 00:07:02,830
Two men on that detail
ought to get medals for dumbness.

70
00:07:03,005 --> 00:07:05,371
They were assigned by you.
You should get one too.

71
00:07:06,943 --> 00:07:09,707
Ditrich, I can do three things about you:

72
00:07:09,879 --> 00:07:12,871
I can reduce you to patrolman,
send you down to Five Corners.

73
00:07:13,116 --> 00:07:16,051
I can bring you up for trial
on charges of incompetence.

74
00:07:16,219 --> 00:07:19,711
Or I can give you one more chance
to make good on your responsibilities.

75
00:07:19,889 --> 00:07:22,551
I think that'll be
the greatest punishment of all.

76
00:07:23,359 --> 00:07:25,156
Thank you, sir.

77
00:07:36,105 --> 00:07:38,972
There's the number you're looking for,
but it's dark.

78
00:07:39,142 --> 00:07:41,110
You want me to wait?

79
00:07:45,214 --> 00:07:48,240
I wouldn't go parading around
this neighborhood with a suitcase.

80
00:07:48,417 --> 00:07:52,877
Some of these young punks might clip you
just to get a clean shirt.

81
00:08:06,903 --> 00:08:08,928
- Yeah?
- I want to see Cobby.

82
00:08:09,105 --> 00:08:11,073
- Who are you?
- Just say Doc is here...

83
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:13,231
...and would like to see him.

84
00:08:25,221 --> 00:08:29,123
Wait here.
You'd better be on the legit, pal.

85
00:08:49,278 --> 00:08:51,803
Well, where the devil is he?

86
00:08:54,050 --> 00:08:56,109
I'm a busy man.
What do you want?

87
00:08:56,285 --> 00:08:57,809
I just got out today.

88
00:08:57,987 --> 00:08:59,887
Oh, so that's it.

89
00:09:00,056 --> 00:09:02,047
I'm tired of you guys
putting a bite on me.

90
00:09:02,225 --> 00:09:04,284
- I'm no bank.
- I got a proposition for you.

91
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:05,893
All you guys have.

92
00:09:06,062 --> 00:09:09,896
- Maybe you didn't get who I was.
- I ain't never seen you before. What is it?

93
00:09:10,066 --> 00:09:14,662
Maybe you've heard of me.
The Professor? Or Herr Doctor, maybe.

94
00:09:15,571 --> 00:09:18,938
You mean, you are Riedenschneider?

95
00:09:19,575 --> 00:09:21,543
Well, why didn't you say so?

96
00:09:22,144 --> 00:09:25,477
Come on in, Doc. Come on in.

97
00:09:28,818 --> 00:09:31,286
Sit down, Doc. Sit down.

98
00:09:32,321 --> 00:09:35,381
- Have a drink?
- Nothing to drink.

99
00:09:36,559 --> 00:09:39,460
I got out of the habit behind the walls.

100
00:09:41,731 --> 00:09:43,164
That's all it is, a habit.

101
00:09:43,332 --> 00:09:48,793
Well, here's to the drink habit, the only one
I got that don't get me into trouble.

102
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:53,634
Well, Doc. What's on your mind?

103
00:09:53,809 --> 00:09:56,073
I got a proposition. A big one.

104
00:09:56,245 --> 00:09:58,805
- How big is big?
- Too big for you, Cobby.

105
00:09:58,981 --> 00:10:02,542
Now, wait, Doc. I don't like to brag,
but I'm doing all right.

106
00:10:02,718 --> 00:10:05,619
Making book. I'm in the chips.

107
00:10:06,689 --> 00:10:08,657
What kind of proposition is it?

108
00:10:08,824 --> 00:10:11,224
A plan for a caper.
And it's a good one.

109
00:10:11,394 --> 00:10:13,988
I could sell it for $ 100,000
on the open market...

110
00:10:14,163 --> 00:10:16,131
...but that would be
throwing money away.

111
00:10:16,299 --> 00:10:18,859
- I prefer to execute it myself and make...
- How much?

112
00:10:19,035 --> 00:10:20,263
Half a million dollars.

113
00:10:21,804 --> 00:10:24,204
Maybe even more.

114
00:10:25,274 --> 00:10:28,801
I will have to do a little checking,
as the plan is some years old...

115
00:10:28,978 --> 00:10:31,378
...but not much checking. Not much.

116
00:10:31,781 --> 00:10:34,909
I need roughly 50,000 to operate.

117
00:10:38,487 --> 00:10:40,421
Fifty thousand?

118
00:10:41,324 --> 00:10:44,350
- No, no, no. I don't see.
- Of course.

119
00:10:44,527 --> 00:10:47,496
I thought maybe Mr. Emmerich<i>...</i>

120
00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:49,789
What do you know about Mr. Emmerich?

121
00:10:49,965 --> 00:10:51,830
Only what I heard in the walls...

122
00:10:52,001 --> 00:10:55,994
...that he has money to invest and that
the way to get to him is through you.

123
00:10:56,172 --> 00:11:00,632
- Lf my information is not correct...
- Correct, sure. Sure. It's correct.

124
00:11:00,810 --> 00:11:04,211
I just never thought of Mr. Emmerich
in connection with this kind of deal.

125
00:11:05,014 --> 00:11:08,108
Excuse me a minute.
I'll be right back.

126
00:11:38,214 --> 00:11:41,047
- Hello, Dix. What do you want?
- I wanna make a bet.

127
00:11:41,217 --> 00:11:44,050
- Well?
- Your man says you got to okay it.

128
00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:47,121
- What are you in for?
- 2300 and some.

129
00:11:47,289 --> 00:11:49,780
Okay. Your tab's good for 2500...

130
00:11:49,959 --> 00:11:53,690
...but that's the limit. Either pick a winner
or pay me when you get that far.

131
00:11:53,863 --> 00:11:55,262
Don't bone me!

132
00:11:58,901 --> 00:12:00,391
- I'm not...
- Did I ever welsh?

133
00:12:00,569 --> 00:12:02,662
- Nobody said you did...
- You just boned me.

134
00:12:02,838 --> 00:12:07,866
I'm not asking you any favors.
I'll go get you your 2300 right now.

135
00:12:09,645 --> 00:12:13,240
Now, Dix. Now, Dix, listen.
Will you have a drink? Come on.

136
00:12:13,416 --> 00:12:15,907
Come on. Come back here.
Have a drink, will you?

137
00:12:16,085 --> 00:12:17,882
Can you beat that?

138
00:12:18,053 --> 00:12:20,988
- Where does he come off, blowing a fuse?
- Who is he?

139
00:12:21,157 --> 00:12:23,523
A smalltime hooligan,
who's crazy for horses.

140
00:12:23,692 --> 00:12:26,820
My book beats him and beats him,
he keeps coming back for more.

141
00:12:26,996 --> 00:12:28,691
Say, Doc...

142
00:12:28,931 --> 00:12:31,058
...I forgot on account of that big tramp.

143
00:12:31,233 --> 00:12:34,634
I spoke to Mr. Emmerich on the phone.
He's gonna meet us later tonight.

144
00:12:34,804 --> 00:12:37,773
He's giving a party at his house in town
for a bunch of swells...

145
00:12:37,940 --> 00:12:40,272
...but he'll be at another address later on.

146
00:12:40,443 --> 00:12:44,311
A man like Emmerich has got
more than one place to hang his hat.

147
00:12:50,553 --> 00:12:55,217
Smart cat. Never does a lick of work,
stays out all night, sleeps all day.

148
00:12:55,391 --> 00:12:58,258
What's a big, dirty cat
doing at an eating joint?

149
00:12:58,427 --> 00:13:01,089
I run over one every time I get a chance.

150
00:13:01,263 --> 00:13:04,289
People feeding cats,
and some kids haven't got enough to eat.

151
00:13:04,467 --> 00:13:06,162
You gonna buy that magazine?

152
00:13:06,335 --> 00:13:09,736
Why should I?
I seen all the dames in it already.

153
00:13:09,905 --> 00:13:11,463
Wanna make something of it?

154
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:15,076
- You're a little off your beat.
- How do you mean, Humpty Dumpty?

155
00:13:15,244 --> 00:13:17,542
I mean, you don't belong around here.

156
00:13:17,713 --> 00:13:21,444
You're just passing through,
only not fast enough.

157
00:13:21,617 --> 00:13:24,518
If I ever see you running over a cat,
I'll kick your teeth out.

158
00:13:24,687 --> 00:13:29,147
I'd take you apart if you were about
a foot taller and straightened up a little.

159
00:13:36,131 --> 00:13:38,258
Suppose you want your heater back.

160
00:13:38,434 --> 00:13:40,561
Well, you ain't gonna get it.
How about that?

161
00:13:40,736 --> 00:13:43,398
- Quit kidding, Gus.
- I mean it.

162
00:13:43,606 --> 00:13:45,904
Go on, get sore. Smack me down.

163
00:13:46,075 --> 00:13:49,203
- You know I wouldn't do that.
- Look, Dix...

164
00:13:49,378 --> 00:13:51,369
...take my advice
and knock off for a while.

165
00:13:51,547 --> 00:13:55,381
The happiness boys are on a rampage.
Headquarters has given them the push.

166
00:13:55,551 --> 00:13:59,009
- I can't afford to knock off.
- Oh, stop worrying. I'll stake you.

167
00:13:59,188 --> 00:14:01,850
- Yeah? I need 2300.
- What?

168
00:14:02,024 --> 00:14:05,687
- Something I just gotta take care of.
- Cobby, maybe?

169
00:14:06,095 --> 00:14:10,122
Well, let him sweat. It'll do him good.
Cobby can spare a few pounds.

170
00:14:10,299 --> 00:14:12,130
You can't owe money
to a guy like him...

171
00:14:12,301 --> 00:14:15,566
...a little loudmouth who bones you
when he isn't even trying to.

172
00:14:15,738 --> 00:14:17,103
I don't get you, Dix.

173
00:14:17,273 --> 00:14:21,403
I just can't be in Cobby's debt
and keep my self-respect.

174
00:14:22,278 --> 00:14:23,711
All right.

175
00:14:23,879 --> 00:14:26,279
I got a grand put away.
You can have that.

176
00:14:26,448 --> 00:14:28,643
Maybe I can dig up 1300 more.

177
00:14:28,817 --> 00:14:31,342
- I guess it's all right to owe me, huh?
- I guess.

178
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:33,545
Yeah. It's just my luck.

179
00:14:34,723 --> 00:14:36,953
Well, I'll get it tomorrow or bust a gut.

180
00:14:37,126 --> 00:14:40,527
In the meantime, stay away
from the boulevard, especially at night.

181
00:14:40,696 --> 00:14:43,062
By the way, they knocked over
the Club Regal.

182
00:14:43,232 --> 00:14:45,166
- Wasn't that where Doll worked?
- Yeah.

183
00:14:45,334 --> 00:14:47,734
It's coming in bunches, it looks like.

184
00:14:48,037 --> 00:14:50,699
Go home, Dix. Stay home.

185
00:14:54,543 --> 00:14:58,673
Don't get your flag at half-mast.
Remember, you still got old Gus.

186
00:15:13,562 --> 00:15:16,360
Thirteen hundred? You must be crazy.

187
00:15:16,999 --> 00:15:19,900
For Dix? What do I care
for that hooligan?

188
00:15:21,170 --> 00:15:24,697
I'd like to help you out, Gus,
but I got mouths to feed...

189
00:15:24,873 --> 00:15:27,239
...and rent to pay and all that stuff.

190
00:15:30,913 --> 00:15:32,676
<i>Why don't you wise up,</i>
<i>you wise guy?</i>

191
00:15:32,848 --> 00:15:34,611
You're a low-down scum.

192
00:15:34,783 --> 00:15:38,048
A low-down, dirty scum,
to talk to me like that.

193
00:16:11,487 --> 00:16:13,455
Look, Gus.

194
00:16:13,822 --> 00:16:16,256
I guess I can make it, all right.

195
00:16:23,732 --> 00:16:26,360
- Yeah?
<i>- Dix, it's me, Doll.</i>

196
00:16:26,535 --> 00:16:28,196
Doll?

197
00:16:40,949 --> 00:16:42,849
Hi, honey.

198
00:16:43,052 --> 00:16:44,747
Come on in.

199
00:16:50,426 --> 00:16:53,793
- Close the door.
- Well, sure, Dix. Sure.

200
00:16:57,199 --> 00:17:00,600
I'm awful sorry to bother you,
honey, but<i>...</i>

201
00:17:17,286 --> 00:17:20,778
Doll, if you're gonna smoke,
you gotta learn to carry matches.

202
00:17:30,265 --> 00:17:32,563
Doll, what are you crying about?

203
00:17:34,303 --> 00:17:35,600
Nothing...

204
00:17:36,438 --> 00:17:37,962
I'm sorry.

205
00:17:39,041 --> 00:17:40,770
I'm sorry, Dix.

206
00:17:40,943 --> 00:17:45,471
I don't know what I was thinking about,
bothering you at this time of the night.

207
00:17:45,748 --> 00:17:47,477
I'll just run along.

208
00:17:48,150 --> 00:17:50,710
Gus told me the Club Regal
got knocked over.

209
00:17:50,886 --> 00:17:56,347
Yeah. Can you imagine, raiding the Regal?
The cops must have all gone crazy.

210
00:17:56,792 --> 00:17:58,953
So it's a clip joint. So what?

211
00:17:59,128 --> 00:18:02,029
And it would have to happen
on pay night.

212
00:18:02,531 --> 00:18:05,500
- How about a drink?
- Hey, don't care if I do.

213
00:18:06,635 --> 00:18:09,604
One of my eyelashes is coming off.

214
00:18:12,241 --> 00:18:14,539
Were you locked out of your room?

215
00:18:14,710 --> 00:18:16,701
How'd you guess?

216
00:18:18,147 --> 00:18:19,910
Here's how.

217
00:18:23,252 --> 00:18:28,519
Dix, if it wouldn't be too much trouble,
could I stay here a couple of days?

218
00:18:32,961 --> 00:18:34,792
Just a day or two.

219
00:18:37,299 --> 00:18:40,894
All right. Stay if you want to,
but don't you go getting any ideas, Doll.

220
00:18:47,810 --> 00:18:50,802
Everything is here, from the observed
routine of the personnel...

221
00:18:50,979 --> 00:18:53,504
...to the alarm system,
the type of locks on doors...

222
00:18:53,682 --> 00:18:56,810
...the age and condition of the main safe
and so forth, so forth.

223
00:18:56,985 --> 00:19:00,819
Take my word for it, Mr. Emmerich.
This is a ripe plum ready to fall.

224
00:19:01,223 --> 00:19:03,748
My friend, according to the boys,
all takes are easy...

225
00:19:03,926 --> 00:19:06,952
...but as a lawyer, I make lots of money
getting them out of jail.

226
00:19:07,129 --> 00:19:09,529
Please, Mr. Emmerich.
Perhaps you know my reputation.

227
00:19:09,698 --> 00:19:11,427
I've engineered some very big things.

228
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:14,064
That's a fact, Mr. Emmerich.
Doc here is tops.

229
00:19:14,236 --> 00:19:17,967
Am I to understand you gathered this
information before doing your last stretch?

230
00:19:18,140 --> 00:19:20,631
That is correct.
I was ready to begin operations...

231
00:19:20,809 --> 00:19:24,074
...and the cops grabbed me for
an old caper I'd almost forgotten about.

232
00:19:24,246 --> 00:19:26,077
The Adelphia Finance caper.

233
00:19:26,248 --> 00:19:28,239
You took them for 160,000,
didn't you, Doc?

234
00:19:28,417 --> 00:19:29,679
A hundred and fifty-eight.

235
00:19:29,852 --> 00:19:32,252
You really believe
there's a million in this thing?

236
00:19:32,421 --> 00:19:34,616
- Maybe even more.
- You mean by that...

237
00:19:34,790 --> 00:19:38,658
...that the take will be worth
half a million to us in actual cash?

238
00:19:38,827 --> 00:19:41,387
You know as well as I do
that in no case will a fence...

239
00:19:41,563 --> 00:19:44,589
...give you more than 50 percent.
- That's right, sir.

240
00:19:44,766 --> 00:19:47,826
- Well, what are your main problems?
- There are three.

241
00:19:48,003 --> 00:19:52,201
Money to operate, personnel
and finally, the disposing of the take.

242
00:19:52,374 --> 00:19:54,001
No trouble about the first, eh?

243
00:19:54,176 --> 00:19:55,973
Wait a minute.
This remains to be seen.

244
00:19:56,144 --> 00:19:58,374
The helpers will be paid off
like housepainters.

245
00:19:58,547 --> 00:20:00,947
They'll be told nothing
about the size of the take.

246
00:20:01,116 --> 00:20:03,949
Sometimes, men get greedy.

247
00:20:05,020 --> 00:20:07,648
- Well, how many helpers do you need?
- Only three.

248
00:20:07,823 --> 00:20:09,051
A box man.

249
00:20:09,224 --> 00:20:12,887
Him, we pay most.
Maybe $25,000.

250
00:20:13,295 --> 00:20:16,958
I got a guy for you. Louis Ciavelli.
Best box man west of Chicago.

251
00:20:17,132 --> 00:20:19,726
Expert mechanic.
Been in some very big capers.

252
00:20:19,902 --> 00:20:23,565
From what I hear, he can open a safe
like the back of a watch. Only, he costs.

253
00:20:24,139 --> 00:20:27,165
Then we need a topnotch driver,
in case of a rumble.

254
00:20:27,342 --> 00:20:29,606
He should get 10,000.

255
00:20:29,778 --> 00:20:32,542
And finally, sad to say,
we need a hooligan.

256
00:20:32,714 --> 00:20:35,649
Most of these fellas are drug addicts.
They're a no-good lot.

257
00:20:35,817 --> 00:20:39,651
Violence is all they know,
but they are, unfortunately, necessary.

258
00:20:39,821 --> 00:20:43,655
For a more or less reliable man,
I'd say 15,000.

259
00:20:44,993 --> 00:20:48,121
Well, that's 50,000 in all.

260
00:20:48,797 --> 00:20:50,389
How...?

261
00:20:51,066 --> 00:20:52,727
How's this take to be handled?

262
00:20:52,901 --> 00:20:55,335
Get in touch with the best fences
in the Midwest...

263
00:20:55,504 --> 00:20:57,768
...and deal with whoever makes
the highest offer.

264
00:20:57,940 --> 00:21:00,272
Maybe no one fence
can handle the whole thing.

265
00:21:00,709 --> 00:21:03,837
In that case, we deal with two or three.

266
00:21:04,079 --> 00:21:06,274
Half a million, eh?

267
00:21:07,883 --> 00:21:09,111
I<i>...</i>

268
00:21:10,452 --> 00:21:13,285
I'm just thinking.

269
00:21:14,623 --> 00:21:18,024
If I decide to go into this thing, I<i>...</i>

270
00:21:18,593 --> 00:21:20,424
I, myself, I might handle the...

271
00:21:20,862 --> 00:21:23,330
You, a fence, Mr. Emmerich?

272
00:21:23,498 --> 00:21:26,626
Oh, no, no, Cobby. Not exactly.

273
00:21:26,802 --> 00:21:30,431
But your proposition looks pretty good.
I'd like to see the most made of it.

274
00:21:31,373 --> 00:21:35,002
Oh, I suppose a fella should stick
to his own trade...

275
00:21:35,177 --> 00:21:38,635
...but I know some big men that might
not be averse to a deal like this...

276
00:21:38,814 --> 00:21:40,782
...if they're properly approached.

277
00:21:41,650 --> 00:21:44,448
Highly respectable men, I might add.

278
00:21:44,619 --> 00:21:48,453
So why don't you let me see what I can do
before you look for a fence.

279
00:21:50,025 --> 00:21:53,256
A few days wouldn't make
much difference to you, I don't suppose.

280
00:21:53,428 --> 00:21:55,328
Might mean a lot more money
for all of us.

281
00:21:55,497 --> 00:21:58,933
Good. There's just one thing.
I dislike to mention it, but...

282
00:21:59,101 --> 00:22:01,729
...I've just come from prison and<i>...</i>
- Well, of course.

283
00:22:01,903 --> 00:22:04,371
Cobby will be glad to advance you
anything you need.

284
00:22:04,539 --> 00:22:07,906
- See that you have a place to stay. Cobby?
- Well, you bet your life.

285
00:22:08,076 --> 00:22:11,603
And I got some fancy phone numbers
for you too, Doc.

286
00:22:16,218 --> 00:22:20,086
What's it like, a man of your taste,
seven years behind the walls?

287
00:22:20,255 --> 00:22:21,745
Not too bad.

288
00:22:21,923 --> 00:22:23,413
It's a matter of temperament.

289
00:22:23,592 --> 00:22:26,857
I cause no trouble.
The prison authorities appreciate that.

290
00:22:27,029 --> 00:22:29,589
They made me assistant librarian.

291
00:22:29,765 --> 00:22:32,495
I'm afraid I wouldn't make
a model prisoner.

292
00:22:32,667 --> 00:22:36,797
After this job, it's Mexico for me.
I'll live like a king.

293
00:22:36,972 --> 00:22:38,599
Mexican girls are very pretty.

294
00:22:38,774 --> 00:22:43,211
I'll have nothing to do all day long
but chase them in the sunshine.

295
00:22:44,713 --> 00:22:47,375
- You've been very kind, sir.
- Good night. Good night.

296
00:22:47,549 --> 00:22:49,779
- Mr. Emmerich.
- Cobby.

297
00:23:16,878 --> 00:23:19,813
What's the big idea, standing there
staring at me, Uncle Lon?

298
00:23:19,981 --> 00:23:21,539
Don't call me "Uncle Lon."

299
00:23:22,284 --> 00:23:24,047
I thought you liked it.

300
00:23:24,219 --> 00:23:25,948
Maybe I did.

301
00:23:26,655 --> 00:23:28,418
I don't anymore.

302
00:23:36,498 --> 00:23:39,092
I had the market send over
some salt mackerel for you.

303
00:23:39,267 --> 00:23:40,996
I know how you love it for breakfast.

304
00:23:42,003 --> 00:23:44,198
Some sweet kid.

305
00:23:47,976 --> 00:23:49,466
It's late.

306
00:23:49,644 --> 00:23:51,942
Why don't you go to bed.

307
00:24:14,336 --> 00:24:17,066
Some sweet kid.

308
00:24:40,662 --> 00:24:42,254
Hello, Bob Brannom?

309
00:24:42,430 --> 00:24:44,091
This is Emmerich.

310
00:24:45,367 --> 00:24:48,131
No, no. I didn't call you
to get the right time.

311
00:24:48,303 --> 00:24:50,601
Listen, I've got a job for you.

312
00:24:50,772 --> 00:24:53,138
No, no. Nothing like that.

313
00:24:53,408 --> 00:24:55,569
I've got over $ 100,000
standing out on my books.

314
00:24:55,744 --> 00:24:59,202
Come to my office tomorrow, I'll give you
a list of the people that owe me.

315
00:24:59,381 --> 00:25:00,848
No, no, no.

316
00:25:01,016 --> 00:25:03,484
Use the method called for
in each particular case...

317
00:25:03,652 --> 00:25:06,678
...and don't tell me anything about it.
All I want is results.

318
00:25:07,989 --> 00:25:09,456
Easy, boy.

319
00:25:10,425 --> 00:25:12,552
Easy, boy. Easy.

320
00:25:15,564 --> 00:25:18,465
Hello. Who?

321
00:25:18,633 --> 00:25:20,464
Oh, sure, Gus.

322
00:25:20,869 --> 00:25:22,928
He's still asleep.

323
00:25:23,104 --> 00:25:24,571
What?

324
00:25:26,041 --> 00:25:28,373
Yeah. Yeah, I'll tell him.

325
00:25:32,781 --> 00:25:34,976
Honey. Honey, that was Gus.

326
00:25:35,150 --> 00:25:37,846
He says you can come over.
He's got something for you.

327
00:25:38,019 --> 00:25:39,384
Okay.

328
00:25:39,554 --> 00:25:41,613
Coffee, honey? I made fresh.

329
00:25:41,790 --> 00:25:43,280
Yeah, yeah.

330
00:25:43,458 --> 00:25:45,892
Hey, you sure were dreaming.

331
00:25:46,228 --> 00:25:47,627
How do you know?

332
00:25:47,796 --> 00:25:50,356
You were talking in your sleep.

333
00:25:50,532 --> 00:25:51,760
What was I saying?

334
00:25:51,933 --> 00:25:54,561
It was all jumbled up,
but I heard one word real plain.

335
00:25:54,736 --> 00:25:56,863
You called it out several times.

336
00:25:57,038 --> 00:25:58,869
"Corn cracker."

337
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:00,598
What's that mean?

338
00:26:00,775 --> 00:26:02,572
Corn cracker.

339
00:26:03,311 --> 00:26:05,302
Corn Cracker was a colt.

340
00:26:05,614 --> 00:26:07,514
Yeah, it would be.

341
00:26:08,049 --> 00:26:12,008
Yeah. He was a tall, black colt.
Yeah, I remember what I was dreaming.

342
00:26:12,554 --> 00:26:14,886
I was up on that colt's back.

343
00:26:15,056 --> 00:26:17,991
My father and my grandfather were there,
watching the fun.

344
00:26:18,159 --> 00:26:20,127
That colt was buckjumping
and pitching...

345
00:26:20,295 --> 00:26:23,594
...and tried to scrape me off against
the fence, but I stayed with him.

346
00:26:23,765 --> 00:26:27,895
Then I heard my granddaddy say, "He's
a real Handley, that boy. A real Handley."

347
00:26:28,069 --> 00:26:29,627
And I felt proud as you please.

348
00:26:29,804 --> 00:26:32,671
Did that really happen, Dix,
when you were a kid?

349
00:26:32,841 --> 00:26:35,935
No. The black colt pitched me
into a fence on the first buck...

350
00:26:36,111 --> 00:26:38,875
...and my old man come over,
prodded me with his boot, said:

351
00:26:39,047 --> 00:26:42,710
"Maybe that'll teach you not to brag
about how good you are on a horse."

352
00:26:44,219 --> 00:26:45,880
It's nice to hear you laugh.

353
00:26:46,788 --> 00:26:48,312
You know something?

354
00:26:48,490 --> 00:26:52,290
One of my ancestors imported the first
Irish thoroughbred into our county.

355
00:26:52,460 --> 00:26:55,327
- Is that a fact?
- Sure.

356
00:26:55,497 --> 00:26:58,364
Why, our farm was in the family
for generations.

357
00:26:58,533 --> 00:27:04,130
One hundred sixty acres,
30 in bluegrass and the rest in crops.

358
00:27:04,306 --> 00:27:06,968
Fine barn and seven brood mares.

359
00:27:07,142 --> 00:27:10,009
- It sounds wonderful, Dix.
- It was.

360
00:27:10,178 --> 00:27:12,146
And then everything happened at once.

361
00:27:12,314 --> 00:27:15,408
My old man died,
and we lost our corn crop.

362
00:27:15,583 --> 00:27:19,781
That black colt I was telling you about,
he broke his leg and had to be shot.

363
00:27:20,288 --> 00:27:22,483
That was a rotten year.

364
00:27:23,124 --> 00:27:25,058
I'll never forget the day we left.

365
00:27:25,226 --> 00:27:29,026
Me and my brother swore we'd buy
Hickorywood Farm back someday.

366
00:27:29,197 --> 00:27:33,156
Growing up in a place and then
having to leave must be awful.

367
00:27:33,335 --> 00:27:34,996
I never had a proper home.

368
00:27:35,170 --> 00:27:37,934
Twelve grand would have swung it,
and I almost made it once.

369
00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:41,402
I had more than $5000 in my pocket...

370
00:27:41,576 --> 00:27:44,204
...and Pampoon was running
in the Suburban.

371
00:27:44,379 --> 00:27:47,610
I figured he couldn't lose.
I put it all on his nose.

372
00:27:48,083 --> 00:27:50,142
He lost by a nose.

373
00:27:50,418 --> 00:27:53,512
Drink your coffee, honey,
before it gets cold.

374
00:27:53,688 --> 00:27:56,919
The way I figure,
my luck's just gotta turn.

375
00:27:57,125 --> 00:28:00,686
One of these days, I'll make a real killing,
then I'm gonna head for home.

376
00:28:00,862 --> 00:28:05,322
First thing I do, I take a bath in the creek
and get this city dirt off me.

377
00:28:10,638 --> 00:28:13,937
- What's the matter?
- Nothing, Dix. Nothing.

378
00:28:14,309 --> 00:28:16,641
- I say something wrong?
- No.

379
00:28:17,545 --> 00:28:21,538
But, gee, this place is a mess.
It needs a good cleaning.

380
00:28:22,217 --> 00:28:25,050
How can you stand to live like this?

381
00:28:31,693 --> 00:28:32,955
Count it.

382
00:28:36,798 --> 00:28:39,767
- Count it.
- Don't have to pay the whole tab at once.

383
00:28:39,934 --> 00:28:42,027
Go ahead and count it.

384
00:28:42,337 --> 00:28:44,771
Why get sore?
There's no reason to get sore.

385
00:28:44,939 --> 00:28:47,499
You boned me in front of a stranger,
made me look small.

386
00:28:47,675 --> 00:28:49,506
I didn't mean it.
I shoot my mouth off.

387
00:28:49,677 --> 00:28:52,168
Maybe I had a slight load on.
You know how it is.

388
00:28:52,347 --> 00:28:53,780
No, I don't know how it is.

389
00:28:54,382 --> 00:28:56,043
Look, Dix...

390
00:28:56,284 --> 00:28:57,911
...I made a mistake.

391
00:28:58,086 --> 00:29:01,385
Don't you ever make a mistake? Sure.

392
00:29:01,556 --> 00:29:04,252
Sure. Here, have a drink.

393
00:29:04,626 --> 00:29:06,184
Here you are.

394
00:29:07,228 --> 00:29:09,253
There you are, Dix.

395
00:29:09,831 --> 00:29:12,698
You gotta play the horses the smart way.
Save your money.

396
00:29:12,867 --> 00:29:17,736
The next time there's a fix,
I'll let you know. It'll be money from home.

397
00:29:20,175 --> 00:29:21,665
Excuse me.

398
00:29:23,411 --> 00:29:25,709
Oh, it's the Doc. Come on in, Doc.

399
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:27,780
Meet a friend of mine, Dix Handley.

400
00:29:27,949 --> 00:29:30,782
This is Doc Riedenschneider.
You heard of him, I guess.

401
00:29:30,952 --> 00:29:32,283
Yeah.

402
00:29:32,454 --> 00:29:35,184
Well, how'd you like the whiskey?
Made in your home state.

403
00:29:35,757 --> 00:29:37,486
Where is that, sir?

404
00:29:37,659 --> 00:29:39,889
Kentucky. Boone County, Kentucky.

405
00:29:40,261 --> 00:29:42,627
- Best water in the U.S.A.
- Is that so?

406
00:29:42,797 --> 00:29:45,322
Yes, the water makes
the whiskey fit to drink.

407
00:29:45,500 --> 00:29:47,195
Well...

408
00:29:48,336 --> 00:29:50,566
...I gotta be going.
I'll see you around, maybe.

409
00:29:50,738 --> 00:29:52,330
So long, Dix.

410
00:29:56,377 --> 00:29:57,810
Big hick.

411
00:29:57,979 --> 00:30:00,777
His money's all right,
but I wish he wasn't so touchy.

412
00:30:00,949 --> 00:30:03,417
Maybe it's a point of honor with him.
A gambling debt.

413
00:30:03,585 --> 00:30:06,679
Him, that hooligan? Honor?
Don't make me laugh.

414
00:30:06,855 --> 00:30:09,221
- He's a hooligan?
- Yeah, but a smalltimer.

415
00:30:09,390 --> 00:30:13,156
He'll stick up cigar stores, gas stations.
And every cent goes to the ponies.

416
00:30:13,328 --> 00:30:15,626
One way or another,
we all work for our vice.

417
00:30:17,198 --> 00:30:20,133
What do you say, Doc?
How was your date last night?

418
00:30:20,301 --> 00:30:24,431
The young lady drank too much,
but the evening wasn't a complete loss.

419
00:30:24,606 --> 00:30:27,871
- She talked more than if she'd been sober.
- Yeah? What about?

420
00:30:28,042 --> 00:30:32,206
- Your friend Mr. Emmerich.
- Emmerich? Now, look here, Doc...

421
00:30:32,380 --> 00:30:35,508
There's half a million at stake.
I've gotta know where I stand.

422
00:30:35,683 --> 00:30:38,117
Emmerich must put up
before I can hire a crew.

423
00:30:38,286 --> 00:30:40,015
For him, it's nothing. A dead cinch.

424
00:30:40,188 --> 00:30:42,850
The information she gave me
is that he's broke.

425
00:30:45,793 --> 00:30:47,283
Are you crazy?

426
00:30:47,462 --> 00:30:50,659
I've seen him operate for 20 years.
He handles only the biggest cases.

427
00:30:50,832 --> 00:30:53,357
He's got two houses, four cars,
half a dozen servants...

428
00:30:53,535 --> 00:30:56,993
- And one blond.
- Doc, whose word you gonna take?

429
00:30:57,171 --> 00:30:59,162
Mine or some dimwitted dame?

430
00:30:59,340 --> 00:31:00,739
Yours, naturally.

431
00:31:00,909 --> 00:31:04,572
If he's broke,
I wanna be broke the same way.

432
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:14,711
Lieutenant! Lieutenant!

433
00:31:16,724 --> 00:31:20,023
That guy you saw in my office,
he's just passing through.

434
00:31:20,194 --> 00:31:23,459
Shut up. I didn't see anybody.
How could I? I wasn't here.

435
00:31:23,631 --> 00:31:26,657
Yeah, that's right. That's right.

436
00:31:26,834 --> 00:31:28,233
- Look<i>...</i>
- Yeah?

437
00:31:28,403 --> 00:31:32,703
I came to tell you
you'll have to stand still for a raid.

438
00:31:32,874 --> 00:31:35,843
- You mean they'll haul me downtown?
- It's a short ride.

439
00:31:36,010 --> 00:31:37,841
I thought you were a friend of mine.

440
00:31:38,012 --> 00:31:40,606
Right now I've got one friend: Ditrich.

441
00:31:40,782 --> 00:31:43,546
And Ditrich's out on his ear
if he don't make a showing.

442
00:31:43,718 --> 00:31:46,812
- Why me? Why pick on me?
- Because it's logic.

443
00:31:46,988 --> 00:31:48,888
You're the biggest parlor in my precinct.

444
00:31:49,057 --> 00:31:52,515
The citizens know it, the newspapers
know it and even I know it.

445
00:31:52,694 --> 00:31:57,324
- And Mr. Commissioner knows I know it.
- I just hate to have it happen, that's all.

446
00:31:57,498 --> 00:32:00,592
- I'm as sorry as you are.
- Look, lieutenant...

447
00:32:00,768 --> 00:32:02,998
...I've always given you
plenty of cooperation...

448
00:32:03,171 --> 00:32:06,538
...but you're hitting me
at just the wrong time.

449
00:32:07,475 --> 00:32:09,670
Well, all right.

450
00:32:09,844 --> 00:32:11,436
Close up tight.

451
00:32:11,613 --> 00:32:13,706
Keep the place dark.
Don't answer any phones.

452
00:32:13,881 --> 00:32:15,473
Thanks, lieutenant.

453
00:32:15,650 --> 00:32:17,049
Thanks.

454
00:32:25,293 --> 00:32:26,760
That copper, he recognized me.

455
00:32:26,928 --> 00:32:29,920
- How'd you know he was a copper?
- I can smell one a block off.

456
00:32:30,098 --> 00:32:32,692
Don't worry about Ditrich.
He's on my payroll.

457
00:32:32,867 --> 00:32:34,459
Me and him, we're like that.

458
00:32:34,636 --> 00:32:36,900
Experience taught me
never to trust a policeman.

459
00:32:37,071 --> 00:32:40,097
Just when you think one's all right,
he turns legit.

460
00:32:43,444 --> 00:32:46,811
- A Mr. Brannom is here.
- Oh, yes, show him in.

461
00:32:46,981 --> 00:32:50,212
Pardon me, sir.
Mrs. Emmerich is not feeling well.

462
00:32:50,385 --> 00:32:52,319
Yes, well...

463
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:55,086
...send for Dr. Houseman.
- I already have, sir.

464
00:32:55,256 --> 00:32:56,518
Good.

465
00:32:56,691 --> 00:32:58,318
Tell her<i>...</i>

466
00:32:58,493 --> 00:33:00,757
Say I'll be up to see her later.

467
00:33:08,069 --> 00:33:11,402
Well, what about my debtors?
How many of them came through?

468
00:33:12,473 --> 00:33:14,805
- Not a one.
- What's that?

469
00:33:14,976 --> 00:33:16,534
You want all the excuses?

470
00:33:16,711 --> 00:33:19,271
- I've got some beauts.
- It's as bad as that, eh?

471
00:33:19,447 --> 00:33:21,472
Two or three may come through with a part.

472
00:33:21,649 --> 00:33:24,641
- They promised.
- I don't want promises, I want cash.

473
00:33:24,952 --> 00:33:28,786
Look, my friend, a private detective
can't go around threatening people.

474
00:33:28,956 --> 00:33:32,483
I'd lose my license. Ninety-eight percent
of them you're gonna have to sue.

475
00:33:32,660 --> 00:33:34,685
There's no time for that.

476
00:33:35,096 --> 00:33:37,428
I gotta have money.
I've gotta have it this minute.

477
00:33:37,598 --> 00:33:40,396
What is it, girl trouble?

478
00:33:40,568 --> 00:33:42,900
Shut up, Brannom! That's not funny.

479
00:33:43,638 --> 00:33:46,607
How's that?
Nobody tells me to shut up.

480
00:33:50,978 --> 00:33:53,037
Sorry, Bob.

481
00:34:01,689 --> 00:34:03,316
Bob, l...

482
00:34:04,225 --> 00:34:06,022
I'm broke.

483
00:34:06,461 --> 00:34:08,554
There. That's the plain, simple fact.

484
00:34:08,730 --> 00:34:11,028
I'm finished. I'm bankrupt.

485
00:34:11,833 --> 00:34:15,269
- How could you let Angela take you?
- It's not Angela.

486
00:34:15,436 --> 00:34:17,927
It's everything. It's my whole way of life.

487
00:34:18,106 --> 00:34:23,100
Every time I turn around, it costs thousands
of dollars. 10,000 here, 10,000 there.

488
00:34:23,478 --> 00:34:26,538
I gotta... I gotta get out.

489
00:34:26,714 --> 00:34:29,205
I gotta get out from under.

490
00:34:31,352 --> 00:34:34,321
And the irony of it is
that I've got an opportunity...

491
00:34:34,489 --> 00:34:36,480
...and I can't take it.
- Tough.

492
00:34:38,659 --> 00:34:40,126
Bob...

493
00:34:42,530 --> 00:34:46,694
...I'm gonna hand you
the shock of a lifetime.

494
00:34:50,138 --> 00:34:52,402
Did you ever hear of
Doc Riedenschneider?

495
00:34:52,573 --> 00:34:54,336
Sure. Behind the walls, isn't he?

496
00:34:54,509 --> 00:34:57,967
No, he's out. He got out last week.
Cobby brought him to me.

497
00:34:58,146 --> 00:35:00,842
He's got a plan, beautifully worked out...

498
00:35:01,015 --> 00:35:04,246
...for the biggest caper ever to be pulled
in the Middle West.

499
00:35:04,418 --> 00:35:07,285
Only, he wants $50,000 backing.

500
00:35:07,455 --> 00:35:09,252
Who would be taken?

501
00:35:10,358 --> 00:35:12,383
Belletier's.

502
00:35:13,461 --> 00:35:17,227
The rocks alone would be worth,
conservatively speaking, half a million.

503
00:35:17,398 --> 00:35:20,367
- How much would you get out of it?
- A third of the take.

504
00:35:20,902 --> 00:35:23,302
Brother. You're knocking me out.

505
00:35:24,505 --> 00:35:28,236
What if I were to tell you that I've got
a plan worked out to get it all?

506
00:35:30,711 --> 00:35:33,771
I could tell them that I'd fence
the stuff myself, you see?

507
00:35:33,948 --> 00:35:36,781
Promise them cash on delivery.

508
00:35:37,318 --> 00:35:38,785
Then...

509
00:35:39,787 --> 00:35:42,779
...when the time comes,
I simply wouldn't have the cash.

510
00:35:42,957 --> 00:35:45,653
I'd tell them it'd take
a few days more to raise it.

511
00:35:47,528 --> 00:35:51,555
I'm certain I could get them to leave
the stuff with me while we're waiting.

512
00:35:51,732 --> 00:35:53,962
- Go on.
- Well, then I'd disappear.

513
00:35:54,135 --> 00:35:57,104
I'd take a plane to another country,
to another life.

514
00:35:57,805 --> 00:36:01,332
The gold and platinum I could melt up
and sell as bullion, you see.

515
00:36:01,509 --> 00:36:04,376
And the rocks, sell them one at a time.

516
00:36:04,545 --> 00:36:06,206
There'd be no hurry.

517
00:36:06,380 --> 00:36:07,904
They'd last a lifetime.

518
00:36:09,917 --> 00:36:11,782
How wrong can a guy be?

519
00:36:11,953 --> 00:36:13,818
Here I was worrying about your nerves...

520
00:36:13,988 --> 00:36:16,786
...and you were dreaming up
a double-cross like this.

521
00:36:17,525 --> 00:36:18,992
Yes.

522
00:36:19,160 --> 00:36:22,994
But I can't do it,
because I haven't got $50,000.

523
00:36:23,164 --> 00:36:24,791
I can tell you how to raise it.

524
00:36:24,966 --> 00:36:28,060
You? How?

525
00:36:28,536 --> 00:36:32,336
- What's in it for me?
- Fifty-fifty.

526
00:36:32,506 --> 00:36:33,905
Okay.

527
00:36:34,075 --> 00:36:36,805
But we may get ourselves killed,
my friend.

528
00:36:38,613 --> 00:36:41,104
Yes, I know.

529
00:36:41,482 --> 00:36:45,350
- Well, how do we raise the money?
- Simple. Cobby.

530
00:36:46,153 --> 00:36:47,586
- Cobby.
- Believe me.

531
00:36:47,755 --> 00:36:49,985
He can dig it up without half-trying.

532
00:36:50,157 --> 00:36:51,818
Yes.

533
00:36:51,993 --> 00:36:54,518
But what do we tell him?
Why do I need money?

534
00:36:54,762 --> 00:36:57,993
Leave it to me. Cobby wants to feel big.

535
00:36:58,165 --> 00:36:59,689
Here's his chance.

536
00:36:59,867 --> 00:37:02,335
Advancing money
for the great Alonzo P. Emmerich.

537
00:37:03,404 --> 00:37:04,928
He'll do it.

538
00:37:05,106 --> 00:37:07,506
He'll sweat, but he'll do it.

539
00:37:09,076 --> 00:37:10,543
What boxes have you opened?

540
00:37:10,711 --> 00:37:14,647
Cannonball, double door,
even a few fire chests. All of them.

541
00:37:14,815 --> 00:37:17,978
- Can you open a vault with a time lock?
- Sure.

542
00:37:18,152 --> 00:37:20,245
- What do you use, lock or seam?
- Seam.

543
00:37:20,421 --> 00:37:21,649
Ever taken one?

544
00:37:21,822 --> 00:37:25,383
- Remember the Shafter job?
- Yes, I heard about it behind the walls.

545
00:37:25,559 --> 00:37:27,527
It was a good score.

546
00:37:27,795 --> 00:37:30,355
- Who supplies your soup?
- I thrash it myself.

547
00:37:30,531 --> 00:37:34,058
- How are you as a picklock?
- I can open anything in four minutes.

548
00:37:34,235 --> 00:37:36,362
- He'll do.
- You're in.

549
00:37:36,537 --> 00:37:39,267
Not so fast. What's the cut?

550
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:42,409
No cut. You get a flat guarantee.

551
00:37:42,710 --> 00:37:45,736
- I want 30,000.
- 30,000? Now, Louis<i>...</i>

552
00:37:45,913 --> 00:37:47,778
Twenty-five is what we figured.

553
00:37:47,949 --> 00:37:49,610
- All right, 15 down.
- Ten down.

554
00:37:49,784 --> 00:37:52,309
Fifteen is satisfactory, I think.

555
00:37:52,586 --> 00:37:54,554
There's your paymaster.

556
00:38:10,071 --> 00:38:11,470
What are you sweating for?

557
00:38:11,639 --> 00:38:14,733
Money makes me sweat, that's all.
It's the way I am.

558
00:38:18,846 --> 00:38:21,610
- Who are the others on this job, Doc?
- Haven't got them yet.

559
00:38:21,782 --> 00:38:24,751
There's only one driver,
as far as I'm concerned. Gus Minissi.

560
00:38:24,919 --> 00:38:26,147
Ask Cobby, he knows him.

561
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:28,345
- Gus, 100 percent.
- Get hold of him.

562
00:38:28,522 --> 00:38:31,355
- He'll take the heat and won't flap his lip.
- Get hold of him.

563
00:38:31,525 --> 00:38:32,753
Sure, Doc.

564
00:38:32,927 --> 00:38:34,485
Any ideas about a hooligan?

565
00:38:36,063 --> 00:38:39,430
I know a very good heavy. I haven't
seen him in some time. Red Traynor.

566
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:42,330
- He's taking the cure.
- Rule him out.

567
00:38:42,503 --> 00:38:43,868
What about Timmons?

568
00:38:44,038 --> 00:38:45,335
- Who's that?
- My doorman.

569
00:38:45,506 --> 00:38:47,474
That busted-down wrestler,
are you kidding?

570
00:38:47,641 --> 00:38:50,201
He's got nothing upstairs
but solid knuckle.

571
00:38:50,378 --> 00:38:54,508
I'm a stranger and do not know
as much as you gentlemen...

572
00:38:54,682 --> 00:38:57,879
...but what about this southerner,
this Dix?

573
00:38:58,052 --> 00:39:02,489
He impressed me as a very determined man
and far from stupid.

574
00:39:04,291 --> 00:39:07,954
Frankly, I don't like the guy,
but I never saw a hooligan I did like.

575
00:39:08,129 --> 00:39:12,122
They're like left-handed pitchers.
They all have a screw loose somewhere.

576
00:39:12,767 --> 00:39:14,701
I suppose he's as good
as anybody, though.

577
00:39:15,436 --> 00:39:17,802
Gus thinks he's tops,
and Gus is usually right.

578
00:39:17,972 --> 00:39:20,600
I like him. I say we take him.

579
00:39:21,409 --> 00:39:22,808
Suits me. You're the boss.

580
00:39:22,977 --> 00:39:26,378
Well, I better be getting home now.
Mrs. Ciavelli's worried about the kid.

581
00:39:26,547 --> 00:39:29,539
- What's the trouble?
- He's got a cold again.

582
00:39:29,784 --> 00:39:32,776
She takes him out first thing
in the morning. It's cold then.

583
00:39:32,953 --> 00:39:35,217
She claims a baby's gotta taste fresh air.

584
00:39:35,389 --> 00:39:40,326
Like I'm always telling her, "If you want
fresh air, don't look for it in this town!"

585
00:39:40,494 --> 00:39:41,984
Here.

586
00:39:46,500 --> 00:39:48,127
He's 9 months old there.

587
00:39:48,302 --> 00:39:51,100
I must say, I envy you,
being a family man.

588
00:39:51,272 --> 00:39:52,705
Yeah.

589
00:39:52,873 --> 00:39:55,740
Well, always problems, huh?

590
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:02,643
One good thing about Dix,
you can get him for nickels and dimes.

591
00:40:03,284 --> 00:40:05,047
Tell me something, Cobby.

592
00:40:05,219 --> 00:40:08,552
It's your money, isn't it?
Not Mr. Emmerich's.

593
00:40:09,156 --> 00:40:11,556
- What difference does it make?
- None, really.

594
00:40:14,195 --> 00:40:17,926
It's this way. Mr. Emmerich doesn't want
this transaction appearing in his books.

595
00:40:18,099 --> 00:40:21,034
I'm not risking anything.
He's good for it in case of a runout.

596
00:40:21,202 --> 00:40:23,397
Then you haven't got a worry.

597
00:40:24,638 --> 00:40:26,105
No.

598
00:40:32,113 --> 00:40:34,343
- Where are you going?
- I found a place.

599
00:40:34,515 --> 00:40:37,245
A girlfriend's leaving town.
She let me have her apartment.

600
00:40:37,751 --> 00:40:39,946
The rent's paid up
till the first of the month.

601
00:40:40,121 --> 00:40:43,022
- When did this happen?
- This morning, before you woke up.

602
00:40:43,190 --> 00:40:44,987
I bumped into her on the street.

603
00:40:45,159 --> 00:40:48,754
Remember that tall brunette, used to do
the novelty dances at the Bandwagon?

604
00:40:48,929 --> 00:40:52,387
Blanche LaRue. It sure was nice of her.

605
00:40:52,566 --> 00:40:56,127
I can't go living off you forever, can I?

606
00:40:56,303 --> 00:40:58,999
- I was glad to help out.
- Yeah.

607
00:40:59,173 --> 00:41:02,574
Well, maybe I can do something
for you sometime.

608
00:41:03,043 --> 00:41:05,739
You don't owe me a thing. Forget it.

609
00:41:06,680 --> 00:41:08,147
Well<i>...</i>

610
00:41:08,816 --> 00:41:10,044
Goodbye.

611
00:41:10,217 --> 00:41:13,050
- How are you fixed for dough?
- A couple of bucks. Enough.

612
00:41:13,220 --> 00:41:14,653
Here, take this and...

613
00:41:14,822 --> 00:41:16,687
No. No, thanks, Dix.

614
00:41:16,857 --> 00:41:18,950
I'm all through bothering.

615
00:41:20,094 --> 00:41:22,187
Give us a kiss, huh?

616
00:41:41,215 --> 00:41:42,773
Doll.

617
00:41:43,350 --> 00:41:45,079
Yes, Dix?

618
00:41:49,557 --> 00:41:51,821
Maybe I'll wanna get in touch with you.

619
00:41:53,360 --> 00:41:54,884
Sure, my new address.

620
00:41:55,062 --> 00:41:58,361
I'll be at 42 Merton Street.

621
00:41:58,532 --> 00:42:00,500
42 Merton.

622
00:42:18,118 --> 00:42:19,346
- Hello.
<i>- Hello, Dix?</i>

623
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:20,885
- Yeah.
<i>- Dix, this is Cobby.</i>

624
00:42:21,055 --> 00:42:23,751
- Oh, hiya, Cobby.
<i>- I got your number from Gus.</i>

625
00:42:23,924 --> 00:42:25,482
- Yeah.
<i>- Look, Dix...</i>

626
00:42:25,659 --> 00:42:28,355
<i>... do you want to get into something big?</i>
<i>I mean, real big.</i>

627
00:42:28,529 --> 00:42:31,259
<i>If you do, be at Gus' tonight at 10:00.</i>

628
00:42:31,432 --> 00:42:32,660
Right.

629
00:42:32,833 --> 00:42:34,630
Everything's here.

630
00:42:34,802 --> 00:42:39,034
The soft spot's an old steam tunnel.
Manhole's on the corner.

631
00:42:39,206 --> 00:42:42,767
You drop into the manhole at 11:45.
Dix will cover you.

632
00:42:42,943 --> 00:42:44,467
You break through the wall.

633
00:42:44,645 --> 00:42:48,604
It'll take about six minutes to get
into Belletier's from the furnace room.

634
00:42:48,782 --> 00:42:50,306
Watch out for floor wires.

635
00:42:50,751 --> 00:42:53,845
Make your way up the back stairs
and jump the alarm system.

636
00:42:54,021 --> 00:42:55,989
That will take another three minutes.

637
00:42:56,156 --> 00:43:01,219
At exactly 11:54,
Dix and I will come to the back door.

638
00:43:01,395 --> 00:43:03,022
You open it for us.

639
00:43:03,197 --> 00:43:05,597
- I'll be waiting for you.
- Good.

640
00:43:06,533 --> 00:43:08,194
Any questions?

641
00:43:08,369 --> 00:43:10,735
- Everything sounds okay.
- Same here.

642
00:43:10,904 --> 00:43:12,701
Well, guess I better be getting home.

643
00:43:12,873 --> 00:43:14,932
- How's the boy?
- Oh, he's okay.

644
00:43:15,109 --> 00:43:17,441
Ran a temperature yesterday.
Pretty high too.

645
00:43:17,611 --> 00:43:20,774
We called the doctor, but temperatures
don't mean so much with kids.

646
00:43:20,948 --> 00:43:23,041
He's back to normal today.

647
00:43:23,217 --> 00:43:26,015
- See you tomorrow night, 11:30.
- Good night.

648
00:43:26,854 --> 00:43:29,015
Have you got a minute, Dix?

649
00:43:29,189 --> 00:43:31,419
Sure. What's on your mind?

650
00:43:31,592 --> 00:43:36,757
My friend, what do you know
about this fellow Emmerich?

651
00:43:36,930 --> 00:43:40,491
You mean the big fixer?
I've heard his name, that's all.

652
00:43:40,668 --> 00:43:43,603
- I can talk to you, I think.
- Sure.

653
00:43:43,771 --> 00:43:47,332
Mr. Emmerich is taking the jewelry
off our hands.

654
00:43:48,742 --> 00:43:50,232
You sure are surprising me, Doc.

655
00:43:50,411 --> 00:43:52,902
I don't exactly trust Mr. Emmerich.

656
00:43:53,080 --> 00:43:55,446
Just a feeling. I may be wrong.

657
00:43:55,616 --> 00:43:58,517
But it's up to us to collect, you and me.

658
00:43:58,686 --> 00:44:02,053
Everything may go smooth,
but if it don't<i>...</i>

659
00:44:02,222 --> 00:44:04,850
- lf he's got it, we'll collect.
- Good.

660
00:44:05,025 --> 00:44:08,893
We'll meet Mr. Emmerich after the caper,
deliver the jewelry and get our money.

661
00:44:09,063 --> 00:44:11,497
The payment is to be immediate
and in cash.

662
00:44:11,665 --> 00:44:14,691
After that, we pay off and scatter.

663
00:44:15,369 --> 00:44:18,236
Don't worry, Doc. We'll collect.

664
00:44:37,424 --> 00:44:38,914
Lon...

665
00:44:39,093 --> 00:44:40,958
...is that you?

666
00:44:41,128 --> 00:44:43,790
- Lon?
- Yes, May.

667
00:44:46,166 --> 00:44:47,394
Come in, Lon.

668
00:44:47,568 --> 00:44:50,503
- I've got a business appointment.
- Sit down a minute.

669
00:44:52,473 --> 00:44:56,102
It's 11:30. Isn't that
rather late for business?

670
00:44:56,577 --> 00:44:58,670
- Lon.
- Yes, May?

671
00:44:58,846 --> 00:45:00,074
I'm not feeling well.

672
00:45:00,247 --> 00:45:02,408
You haven't been feeling well
for a long time.

673
00:45:02,583 --> 00:45:04,107
At night, I get nervous.

674
00:45:04,284 --> 00:45:08,015
And when I get nervous, I hate
to stay in this big house all by myself.

675
00:45:08,188 --> 00:45:11,624
Look here. May, you're not alone.
There are three servants in the house.

676
00:45:12,025 --> 00:45:14,619
- All you have to...
- I know. Press a button.

677
00:45:15,129 --> 00:45:17,290
Well, what do you want me to do?

678
00:45:19,133 --> 00:45:21,033
Sit down, Lon.

679
00:45:23,337 --> 00:45:24,929
All right.

680
00:45:25,439 --> 00:45:28,431
Do I sit here and watch you
read a magazine?

681
00:45:28,609 --> 00:45:31,009
- Would that be so awful?
- Oh, now, look, May...

682
00:45:31,178 --> 00:45:32,975
We could play cards.

683
00:45:33,147 --> 00:45:35,741
- Casino, like we used to.
- Some other night.

684
00:45:36,283 --> 00:45:38,911
Please, Lon, just one hand.

685
00:45:39,086 --> 00:45:41,281
I couldn't sleep last night.

686
00:45:41,455 --> 00:45:43,514
Then I got to thinking of the old days...

687
00:45:43,690 --> 00:45:48,320
...how we used to like to stay up
and play casino. Just the two of us.

688
00:45:48,762 --> 00:45:52,721
Yes. I wish I could stay, but I can't.

689
00:45:52,900 --> 00:45:54,561
My dear, this is business.

690
00:45:55,969 --> 00:45:57,300
I tell you what I'll do.

691
00:45:57,471 --> 00:46:01,532
I'll look in later, and if you're still awake,
we'll have a little game.

692
00:46:31,071 --> 00:46:33,301
Take your keys, please. We're closing up.

693
00:46:33,474 --> 00:46:35,203
Okay.

694
00:46:44,017 --> 00:46:46,451
- All set?
- Yeah.

695
00:47:22,689 --> 00:47:24,919
Better be careful
how you handle this stuff.

696
00:47:25,092 --> 00:47:27,322
They'll pick you up in little pieces.

697
00:48:32,626 --> 00:48:34,617
What time have you got?

698
00:48:35,629 --> 00:48:37,062
Good.

699
00:48:52,312 --> 00:48:53,540
Good luck, Doc.

700
00:48:54,681 --> 00:48:56,740
Did he give you the soup?

701
00:50:02,449 --> 00:50:04,849
Here's the electric eye.

702
00:50:39,052 --> 00:50:40,644
Soup.

703
00:51:45,152 --> 00:51:47,985
It's gonna take a lot to blow this baby.

704
00:52:44,211 --> 00:52:46,145
Here goes.

705
00:53:23,250 --> 00:53:25,980
- What's that?
- Keep going.

706
00:53:32,492 --> 00:53:34,756
Hey, Doc, alarms are going off
all over the block.

707
00:53:34,928 --> 00:53:37,590
- The blast must've shook the whole system.
- What do we do?

708
00:53:37,764 --> 00:53:39,925
I would hate to leave now.
We're so close.

709
00:53:40,100 --> 00:53:42,762
- I'm for finishing what we started.
- How about you, Louis?

710
00:53:42,936 --> 00:53:44,904
- It's okay with me.
- Will Gus hold still?

711
00:53:45,071 --> 00:53:47,232
Don't worry about Gus.

712
00:53:52,279 --> 00:53:53,769
What's the matter?

713
00:53:53,947 --> 00:53:55,847
The drill broke.

714
00:53:57,584 --> 00:54:01,384
We should finish before 12:15,
before the watchman gets here.

715
00:54:01,554 --> 00:54:03,886
The store cop? Let me worry about him.

716
00:54:08,495 --> 00:54:09,985
- Hear that, Dix?
- Yeah.

717
00:54:10,163 --> 00:54:12,563
- Coming this way?
- From the river. Don't sound good.

718
00:54:12,732 --> 00:54:14,393
Take a look, see what's happening.

719
00:55:09,656 --> 00:55:11,021
We gotta blow, fast!

720
00:55:11,191 --> 00:55:14,183
This is everything of real value.

721
00:55:15,195 --> 00:55:17,561
- Heavy, ain't she?
- Plenty.

722
00:55:19,766 --> 00:55:21,825
This is the biggest one yet.

723
00:55:22,002 --> 00:55:24,493
Wait till you see it in the papers.

724
00:55:51,398 --> 00:55:53,366
Watchman. Pull open the door, Louis.

725
00:55:53,533 --> 00:55:56,161
- Maybe he'll go away.
- Do what Dix says.

726
00:55:59,439 --> 00:56:00,906
Now.

727
00:56:07,113 --> 00:56:08,774
Follow me.

728
00:57:27,460 --> 00:57:29,360
- Gus, take me home.
- Where did it get you?

729
00:57:29,529 --> 00:57:32,555
Thigh. I can feel it going up.
I think I got the slug in my belly.

730
00:57:32,732 --> 00:57:36,600
- I'll take you to a guy, used to be a doctor.
- No, no. Take me home, Gus!

731
00:57:36,769 --> 00:57:38,361
All right, Louis.

732
00:58:00,460 --> 00:58:03,486
It's after 1.
They should be here any minute.

733
00:58:04,531 --> 00:58:06,624
Unless there's been trouble.

734
00:58:06,799 --> 00:58:09,267
Where is Angela tonight?

735
00:58:09,769 --> 00:58:11,930
She's at her sister's.

736
00:58:12,105 --> 00:58:13,834
She says.

737
00:58:14,374 --> 00:58:16,501
I'd go easy on that liquor if I were you.

738
00:58:16,676 --> 00:58:19,702
Half-drunk, I got better wits
than most people.

739
00:58:20,880 --> 00:58:22,780
And more nerve.

740
00:58:24,684 --> 00:58:26,117
You look worried, my friend.

741
00:58:26,286 --> 00:58:28,277
Something bothering you?

742
00:58:30,323 --> 00:58:31,722
Live and learn.

743
00:58:31,891 --> 00:58:35,327
All these years, I've been suffering
from an inferiority complex.

744
00:58:35,495 --> 00:58:37,861
I should've been in the money
years ago.

745
00:58:38,031 --> 00:58:41,023
You big boys, what have you got?

746
00:58:41,201 --> 00:58:43,260
Front. Nothing but front.

747
00:58:43,436 --> 00:58:45,336
And when that slips<i>...</i>

748
00:58:46,606 --> 00:58:49,734
I do believe our guests are arriving.

749
00:59:02,522 --> 00:59:04,786
Well? Everything go all right?

750
00:59:07,293 --> 00:59:09,056
This is a friend of mine, Mr. Brannom.

751
00:59:09,229 --> 00:59:11,288
He's been a great help to me
on this deal.

752
00:59:11,464 --> 00:59:13,796
Follow me. Follow me, gentlemen.

753
00:59:13,967 --> 00:59:16,299
It's much more comfortable in here.

754
00:59:26,446 --> 00:59:30,246
Say, I'll bet that thing is full
of Koh-i-noors and Grand Moguls, eh?

755
00:59:30,416 --> 00:59:31,940
Could be.

756
00:59:32,919 --> 00:59:34,750
Sit down, gentlemen. Sit down.

757
00:59:34,921 --> 00:59:37,651
- Let me get you a drink.
- No, thanks.

758
00:59:38,391 --> 00:59:39,790
Do you mind if we have a look?

759
00:59:39,959 --> 00:59:42,325
You're entitled to a look, naturally.

760
01:00:02,915 --> 01:00:05,213
- Convinced?
- Why, of course. Of course.

761
01:00:05,385 --> 01:00:09,446
There never was any doubt in my mind.
You know, I know this fellow's reputation.

762
01:00:09,622 --> 01:00:12,216
Just a matter of curiosity, that's all.

763
01:00:13,026 --> 01:00:15,859
I'll bet the appraisal is going to exceed
even your estimate...

764
01:00:16,029 --> 01:00:17,462
Good. Good.

765
01:00:17,630 --> 01:00:20,292
In that case, I'd just like to see
the color of the money.

766
01:00:21,501 --> 01:00:25,597
Gentlemen, I must admit
at this moment I<i>...</i>

767
01:00:25,772 --> 01:00:27,501
I'm embarrassed.

768
01:00:27,674 --> 01:00:30,700
- You mean you haven't got the money?
- Oh, I have it.

769
01:00:30,877 --> 01:00:33,937
- That is, I have the assurance of it.
- You haven't got it.

770
01:00:34,213 --> 01:00:37,979
No, I haven't got the currency
right here in my hands...

771
01:00:38,151 --> 01:00:40,745
...but it's promised
by an unimpeachable source.

772
01:00:40,920 --> 01:00:44,720
Gentlemen, I'm afraid we were
a little hasty. We moved too fast.

773
01:00:44,891 --> 01:00:47,121
We moved on your word.

774
01:00:47,293 --> 01:00:49,887
Wait a minute.
That's a large sum of money, you know...

775
01:00:50,063 --> 01:00:52,088
...considering present-day conditions...

776
01:00:52,265 --> 01:00:55,063
...and considering the fact
that we had to have it in cash.

777
01:00:55,234 --> 01:00:59,728
So I'm afraid a few days more
are needed to raise it.

778
01:00:59,906 --> 01:01:03,740
A few days more may not seem like
a very long time to you, Mr. Emmerich.

779
01:01:03,910 --> 01:01:07,243
But to me, carrying this around,
it would seem like years.

780
01:01:07,413 --> 01:01:09,540
I understand.
I've got a solution for that too.

781
01:01:09,716 --> 01:01:12,184
That is, if you boys trust me.

782
01:01:12,352 --> 01:01:17,051
And if you don't, well, there's nothing
I can say except that I'm sorry.

783
01:01:18,257 --> 01:01:21,158
Mr. Emmerich,
what are you trying to tell us?

784
01:01:21,494 --> 01:01:23,962
About the jewels.

785
01:01:24,130 --> 01:01:26,655
Wouldn't be safe for you
to carry that stuff around.

786
01:01:27,300 --> 01:01:28,995
You mean, we leave them with you?

787
01:01:29,302 --> 01:01:32,931
Well, when the police start looking
for that stuff tomorrow morning...

788
01:01:33,106 --> 01:01:35,097
...they're not likely to call me up.

789
01:01:35,274 --> 01:01:39,074
They're not likely to send detectives out
to search my house, you know.

790
01:01:39,579 --> 01:01:41,774
You, on the other hand, Doc, you<i>...</i>

791
01:01:41,948 --> 01:01:43,381
You're just out of prison.

792
01:01:44,083 --> 01:01:47,348
They're certainly gonna be looking
for the big-timers like yourself.

793
01:01:49,589 --> 01:01:53,719
Some smart cop might even connect
this burglary with your release.

794
01:02:00,433 --> 01:02:02,799
Well, there you are.

795
01:02:04,237 --> 01:02:07,570
Of course, as I said, it's up to you.

796
01:02:08,474 --> 01:02:10,305
Keep in touch with me through Cobby.

797
01:02:10,476 --> 01:02:13,377
You did a great job, Emmerich,
but it's not working.

798
01:02:13,546 --> 01:02:16,743
- Bob!
- Back away and keep out of this, Emmerich.

799
01:02:16,916 --> 01:02:20,215
Now, you, farmer, get your hands up.

800
01:02:21,587 --> 01:02:23,612
And you, Fritz...

801
01:02:24,357 --> 01:02:26,552
...throw the bag on the floor.

802
01:02:26,726 --> 01:02:28,489
Over here by my feet.

803
01:02:28,661 --> 01:02:30,561
Be careful how you throw it.

804
01:02:30,730 --> 01:02:32,527
I got a pistol expert medal.

805
01:02:32,698 --> 01:02:34,928
- What do you say, Dix?
- He's got no say.

806
01:02:35,501 --> 01:02:38,698
He makes a crooked move,
he'll never pitch another forkful of manure.

807
01:02:41,140 --> 01:02:43,199
He's got us, Doc. Toss him the bag.

808
01:02:43,643 --> 01:02:45,770
You're not as dumb as you look.

809
01:02:58,024 --> 01:02:59,514
Are you a man or what?

810
01:02:59,692 --> 01:03:02,923
Trying to gyp and double-cross me
with no guts for it.

811
01:03:03,830 --> 01:03:06,697
What's inside of you?
What's keeping you alive?

812
01:03:14,307 --> 01:03:16,366
Why don't you kill me?

813
01:03:16,809 --> 01:03:19,073
- What's stopping you?
- Okay, mister...

814
01:03:19,245 --> 01:03:22,408
Dix, listen to me. Don't kill him.
It's too easy an out for him.

815
01:03:22,582 --> 01:03:24,345
Sit down, sir.

816
01:03:25,918 --> 01:03:28,409
Whatever possessed you
to pull such a stunt?

817
01:03:28,588 --> 01:03:31,216
I was broke, facing bankruptcy.

818
01:03:31,424 --> 01:03:33,449
He's a witness.
He saw me knock off that guy.

819
01:03:33,626 --> 01:03:37,426
- You think he wouldn't holler?
- He's in no position to talk.

820
01:03:37,730 --> 01:03:40,858
What did you and your man on the floor
intend to do with the jewels?

821
01:03:41,033 --> 01:03:43,831
Leave town.
Sell them off a little at a time.

822
01:03:44,003 --> 01:03:47,439
No good. The police would have been
on you after the first sale.

823
01:03:47,607 --> 01:03:50,576
You can't go peddling stuff like this around
when the heat's on.

824
01:03:50,743 --> 01:03:52,768
Let's not fool around here any longer.

825
01:03:52,945 --> 01:03:54,173
Be patient, Dix.

826
01:03:54,347 --> 01:03:57,646
Mr. Emmerich got us into this hole,
and he's going to get us out.

827
01:03:58,150 --> 01:04:01,415
I didn't save your life
because I'm a lover of humanity.

828
01:04:01,587 --> 01:04:03,851
We're in trouble with
this satchel full of jewels.

829
01:04:04,023 --> 01:04:07,049
As things stand, it's just so much junk.

830
01:04:07,326 --> 01:04:10,318
- There's nothing I can do.
- Yes, there is, Mr. Emmerich.

831
01:04:10,496 --> 01:04:13,056
You can go to the insurance company.

832
01:04:13,766 --> 01:04:15,859
- Insurance company?
- They'll listen to reason.

833
01:04:16,035 --> 01:04:17,730
This is a very bad jolt for them.

834
01:04:17,904 --> 01:04:21,499
It's possible they'll be willing to buy
the jewels back, no questions asked...

835
01:04:21,674 --> 01:04:24,666
...for as high as 25 percent
of what they're worth.

836
01:04:24,844 --> 01:04:26,505
Doc, let's blow.

837
01:04:26,679 --> 01:04:28,544
I'll start on it tomorrow.

838
01:04:29,448 --> 01:04:30,881
Get busy, Emmerich.

839
01:04:31,050 --> 01:04:34,747
And remember, you might have been
lying here dead with your friend.

840
01:04:36,255 --> 01:04:38,382
Shall I get in touch with you
through Cobby?

841
01:04:38,558 --> 01:04:41,118
No. I'll get in touch with you.

842
01:04:41,294 --> 01:04:42,955
Come on, Dix.

843
01:04:43,496 --> 01:04:46,624
I advise you to clean up after your friend.

844
01:04:51,938 --> 01:04:54,907
- Don't give him any water.
- He asked for it.

845
01:04:55,308 --> 01:04:57,276
- I said, don't give him any water.
- Let go.

846
01:04:57,443 --> 01:04:59,911
You wanna kill him?
Maybe he's hurt in the stomach.

847
01:05:00,079 --> 01:05:02,946
Where's the doctor?
Why doesn't he come?

848
01:05:03,115 --> 01:05:05,606
You said 10 minutes. It's half an hour.

849
01:05:05,785 --> 01:05:07,514
Louis will die.

850
01:05:07,687 --> 01:05:09,416
Why can't I take him to the hospital?

851
01:05:09,589 --> 01:05:13,218
They wheel him into an operating room,
you'll never see him again.

852
01:05:13,659 --> 01:05:16,526
Take it easy, Maria.
Louis is gonna be all right.

853
01:05:16,696 --> 01:05:18,857
The doctor will be here,
fix him up good as new.

854
01:05:19,265 --> 01:05:21,529
You and Louis are gonna have
six more kids.

855
01:05:21,701 --> 01:05:25,535
All as fat as pigs, big black eyes,
lots of hair.

856
01:05:25,705 --> 01:05:27,536
Just like Louis, eh, Maria?

857
01:05:27,707 --> 01:05:29,732
Stay away from the baby!

858
01:05:38,050 --> 01:05:39,711
Tell me the truth.
How did it happen?

859
01:05:39,885 --> 01:05:43,343
- I told you. A fight.
- Louis don't fight. You know that.

860
01:05:45,257 --> 01:05:46,781
Why is it always you?

861
01:05:46,959 --> 01:05:49,689
Whenever Louis gets into trouble,
you're around.

862
01:05:49,862 --> 01:05:52,262
You dirty cripple! You crooked-back!

863
01:05:52,565 --> 01:05:54,829
- You have the evil eye!
- Shut your mouth, Maria!

864
01:05:55,001 --> 01:05:57,401
I don't let anybody say that to me.

865
01:06:08,247 --> 01:06:10,272
I'm sorry, Gus...

866
01:06:10,683 --> 01:06:12,412
...but I gotta blame somebody.

867
01:06:12,818 --> 01:06:15,184
What I carry on my back,
I was born with it.

868
01:06:15,354 --> 01:06:17,015
I didn't grow it myself.

869
01:06:17,189 --> 01:06:20,556
Please forgive me, Gus. I didn't mean it.

870
01:06:27,767 --> 01:06:31,294
- Listen to that.
- Yeah. Must be a fire.

871
01:06:31,470 --> 01:06:34,303
It's not in this neighborhood, though.
Someplace else.

872
01:06:34,974 --> 01:06:38,034
Oh, Gus. I pray to God
that doctor get here quick.

873
01:06:38,210 --> 01:06:40,804
He'll be here any minute, Maria.

874
01:06:43,315 --> 01:06:46,045
Sounds like a soul in hell.

875
01:07:30,062 --> 01:07:34,226
Dix, why don't you get in touch with Gus
and let him take you to the doctor.

876
01:07:34,400 --> 01:07:36,561
- Don't be foolish.
- I don't like doctors.

877
01:07:36,736 --> 01:07:38,397
I'm getting along all right.

878
01:07:38,571 --> 01:07:41,938
That bullet just ripped through my side
and went on about its business.

879
01:07:42,108 --> 01:07:45,168
- Good thing I jumped.
- How can things go so wrong?

880
01:07:45,344 --> 01:07:46,641
How is it possible?

881
01:07:46,812 --> 01:07:49,178
One man killed,
two others plugged.

882
01:07:49,348 --> 01:07:52,647
I'm out 30 grand. We got a load
of rocks we can't even peddle.

883
01:07:52,818 --> 01:07:54,809
Quit crying and get me some bourbon.

884
01:07:59,992 --> 01:08:02,222
I must be awful stupid.

885
01:08:02,394 --> 01:08:04,828
Here I am with
a good business...

886
01:08:05,865 --> 01:08:07,492
...money rolling in...

887
01:08:07,666 --> 01:08:10,692
...I gotta get mixed up
in a thing like this.

888
01:08:11,704 --> 01:08:13,968
I ought to have
my head examined.

889
01:08:17,209 --> 01:08:19,677
Yeah, hello, hello.
Yeah, this is Cobby.

890
01:08:20,646 --> 01:08:21,908
What?

891
01:08:22,081 --> 01:08:25,312
It's Gus. Dragnet's out,
and they're combing the district.

892
01:08:25,651 --> 01:08:28,176
He wants to talk to you.
You, Dix.

893
01:08:30,823 --> 01:08:32,085
Gus? Dix.

894
01:08:32,258 --> 01:08:33,520
Yeah. Listen careful.

895
01:08:33,692 --> 01:08:37,025
Cops are knocking over joints along
the boulevard, meat wagons and all.

896
01:08:37,196 --> 01:08:39,528
Now, look, I already called a guy,
Eddie Donato.

897
01:08:39,698 --> 01:08:43,293
Donato's got a grocery down by the river.
116 Front Street. You got that?

898
01:08:43,469 --> 01:08:45,266
<i>Yeah. Thanks, Gus. How's Louis?</i>

899
01:08:45,437 --> 01:08:48,770
Louis is not so good. He got a slug
in his belly. Doc's doing all he can.

900
01:08:48,941 --> 01:08:51,375
Here they are now,
the happiness boys.

901
01:08:51,544 --> 01:08:54,172
Hello. How are you?
Looks like I'm in for a working-over.

902
01:08:54,346 --> 01:08:56,746
Look. Go down to Eddie's
by way of the old car barn.

903
01:08:56,916 --> 01:08:59,510
It's deserted at night.
You get beyond that, you're okay.

904
01:08:59,685 --> 01:09:02,677
Cops never bother Eddie's neighborhood.
So long, Dix. Blow now.

905
01:09:02,855 --> 01:09:04,755
All right, all right, all right.

906
01:09:10,859 --> 01:09:13,828
What? Please talk a little louder.

907
01:09:13,996 --> 01:09:15,258
This is Eddie Donato.

908
01:09:15,731 --> 01:09:18,495
Oh, sure, sure.
I'll get Doc for you.

909
01:09:18,667 --> 01:09:20,794
Hey, <i>dottore</i>, I got your man.

910
01:09:24,973 --> 01:09:26,440
Hello.

911
01:09:27,009 --> 01:09:28,271
Yes.

912
01:09:28,777 --> 01:09:30,836
Fine, fine.

913
01:09:31,013 --> 01:09:32,275
Good.

914
01:09:32,448 --> 01:09:34,245
That will be satisfactory.

915
01:09:41,156 --> 01:09:42,817
- Cobby?
- Yes.

916
01:09:42,991 --> 01:09:44,618
Emmerich came through.

917
01:09:44,793 --> 01:09:46,784
The insurance people say okay.

918
01:09:46,962 --> 01:09:49,863
Of course, we have to wait
till the banks open Monday morning.

919
01:09:50,032 --> 01:09:53,934
But it's 250,000, which is not bad.

920
01:09:58,040 --> 01:10:01,066
- What's the matter?
- As a lawyer, you may be very brilliant.

921
01:10:01,243 --> 01:10:04,371
But as a casino player,
you have a lot to learn.

922
01:10:04,546 --> 01:10:07,379
- You don't mind if I smoke, do you?
- Of course not, Lon.

923
01:10:08,283 --> 01:10:10,717
Lon, how could you make
a play like that?

924
01:10:10,886 --> 01:10:13,582
You won't make
a single point this hand.

925
01:10:13,755 --> 01:10:16,383
- Come in.
- Two gentlemen to see you, sir.

926
01:10:16,558 --> 01:10:18,219
They are from the police department.

927
01:10:18,393 --> 01:10:20,759
What on earth could they want, Lon?

928
01:10:20,929 --> 01:10:23,727
Well, something to do
with a case, I suppose.

929
01:10:23,899 --> 01:10:26,697
- Excuse me?
- Oh, bother. We were having so much fun.

930
01:10:26,869 --> 01:10:28,996
- Hurry back.
- Sure.

931
01:10:43,118 --> 01:10:45,382
- Yes?
- Sorry to disturb you, Mr. Emmerich.

932
01:10:45,554 --> 01:10:48,022
I'm Andrews.
This is Officer Janocek.

933
01:10:48,190 --> 01:10:50,283
- How do you do?
- How are you?

934
01:10:50,459 --> 01:10:53,189
Well, what can I do for you?

935
01:10:53,362 --> 01:10:55,489
Do you know a man
named Robert Brannom?

936
01:10:55,664 --> 01:10:57,461
Brannom. Yes, of course.

937
01:10:57,633 --> 01:10:59,601
What is it?
Something the matter?

938
01:10:59,768 --> 01:11:01,258
There sure is, Mr. Emmerich.

939
01:11:01,436 --> 01:11:03,996
His body was pulled
out of the river this morning.

940
01:11:04,506 --> 01:11:07,236
- Great heavens.
- But it was no drowning.

941
01:11:07,409 --> 01:11:09,104
He had a hole through his pump.

942
01:11:09,278 --> 01:11:10,836
He'd been shot.

943
01:11:12,447 --> 01:11:15,280
Will you step in here for a minute?

944
01:11:19,788 --> 01:11:22,348
Well, I must say, this is<i>...</i>

945
01:11:22,758 --> 01:11:24,851
It's quite a shock.
Bob Brannom, eh?

946
01:11:25,027 --> 01:11:27,825
Murdered, you say?
Great heavens.

947
01:11:27,996 --> 01:11:31,898
We found a list of names in his pocket
written on your business stationery.

948
01:11:32,067 --> 01:11:35,833
- Who are these people, do you know?
- Oh, that's a list of my debtors.

949
01:11:36,004 --> 01:11:39,030
Brannom was working for me.
He was trying to collect old debts...

950
01:11:39,207 --> 01:11:41,334
...without much success, I must say.

951
01:11:41,510 --> 01:11:44,172
Was he giving the treatment
to anybody on this list?

952
01:11:44,780 --> 01:11:46,372
Certainly not.

953
01:11:46,548 --> 01:11:50,678
Then you don't think there's any connection
between this work for you and his death?

954
01:11:50,852 --> 01:11:52,843
- None whatever.
- When did you see him last?

955
01:11:53,021 --> 01:11:56,252
Well, now, last Wednesday evening,
in this room.

956
01:11:56,425 --> 01:11:59,656
Yes. We went over that list together.

957
01:12:00,395 --> 01:12:03,193
The coroner says he was plugged
at 1:00 or 2:00 this morning.

958
01:12:03,365 --> 01:12:05,458
Not much after the Belletier job was pulled.

959
01:12:06,001 --> 01:12:07,798
We figured there
might be a connection.

960
01:12:07,970 --> 01:12:10,268
One of the heist guys was shot,
we know that.

961
01:12:10,439 --> 01:12:13,237
There was blood on the floor.
Maybe it was Brannom's.

962
01:12:13,408 --> 01:12:16,172
He could've died in the car,
they dropped him in the river.

963
01:12:16,345 --> 01:12:21,146
Oh, no, no. Bob Brannom's a good deal
of a roughneck, but he's no criminal.

964
01:12:21,316 --> 01:12:24,774
And if I'm any judge, Belletier's was
the work of bigtime professionals.

965
01:12:25,988 --> 01:12:30,084
Oh, no, no, gentlemen.
Bob Brannom mixed up in any burglary...

966
01:12:30,258 --> 01:12:31,919
...why, that's inconceivable.

967
01:12:32,160 --> 01:12:33,559
I see.

968
01:12:33,895 --> 01:12:37,626
Oh, one more thing, Mr. Emmerich.
Just for the records, of course.

969
01:12:37,799 --> 01:12:40,859
Could you give us an account
of your whereabouts last night?

970
01:12:41,036 --> 01:12:42,799
Yes, I could.

971
01:12:43,572 --> 01:12:45,472
Why? Is it necessary?

972
01:12:45,641 --> 01:12:47,734
I'm afraid so, Mr. Emmerich.

973
01:12:48,243 --> 01:12:52,202
Well, boys, a man of my years
hates to make an admission like this...

974
01:12:52,381 --> 01:12:56,010
...but a Miss Phinlay is living
in my cottage on the river.

975
01:12:56,184 --> 01:13:01,884
And last night, I went to visit her
at about 11:30, I think it was.

976
01:13:02,157 --> 01:13:04,057
Stayed rather late.

977
01:13:04,226 --> 01:13:07,218
Oh, she'll verify this, of course.

978
01:13:07,696 --> 01:13:09,527
Oh, but boys...

979
01:13:10,098 --> 01:13:12,066
...use a little discretion, eh?

980
01:13:12,234 --> 01:13:14,464
Unless, of course, it serves
some useful purpose.

981
01:13:14,636 --> 01:13:17,662
I understand, Mr. Emmerich,
and thank you very much for your help.

982
01:13:17,839 --> 01:13:19,807
Oh, not at all. Thank you.

983
01:13:19,975 --> 01:13:22,671
And say, if I can be any further help,
you just call on me.

984
01:13:22,844 --> 01:13:25,210
- Good day.
- Good day.

985
01:13:42,197 --> 01:13:43,789
- Hello, Angela?
<i>- Yes.</i>

986
01:13:43,965 --> 01:13:45,830
- This is Lon.
<i>- Why haven't you called me</i>?

987
01:13:46,001 --> 01:13:48,333
Listen, baby,
you may have a visit from the police.

988
01:13:48,503 --> 01:13:52,439
<i>- Is it your wife</i>?
- No, no. It's nothing like that.

989
01:13:52,908 --> 01:13:56,344
They'll probably ask you
some questions about last night.

990
01:13:56,511 --> 01:13:57,842
Now, listen, baby.

991
01:13:58,013 --> 01:14:01,073
I want you to tell them
that I was there with you...

992
01:14:01,249 --> 01:14:04,810
...from 11:30 until 3 in the morning.

993
01:14:04,986 --> 01:14:07,750
<i>- That's most of the night.</i>
- Most of the night, that's right.

994
01:14:07,923 --> 01:14:09,823
- Now, is that clear?
<i>- Sure, it's clear.</i>

995
01:14:09,991 --> 01:14:13,518
Yes. Oh, no, no. Just politics, baby.

996
01:14:13,695 --> 01:14:17,187
- Good old dirty politics.
<i>- All right. Call me right away.</i>

997
01:14:17,365 --> 01:14:19,230
- Yes, I'll call you later.
<i>- Don't forget.</i>

998
01:14:19,401 --> 01:14:21,164
Yes.

999
01:14:35,183 --> 01:14:36,650
Can we go on playing?

1000
01:14:37,586 --> 01:14:39,486
Certainly. Why not?

1001
01:14:40,422 --> 01:14:43,653
Why, Lon, you're as pale as a ghost.

1002
01:14:44,025 --> 01:14:45,424
What's the matter?

1003
01:14:47,629 --> 01:14:50,325
Well, I just had some bad news.

1004
01:14:50,966 --> 01:14:52,991
A man who works for me got killed.

1005
01:14:53,168 --> 01:14:55,830
Oh, Lon, how awful.
Was it an accident?

1006
01:14:56,004 --> 01:14:57,403
No.

1007
01:14:57,572 --> 01:14:59,665
No. It was...

1008
01:15:01,042 --> 01:15:02,304
...an intentional killing.

1009
01:15:03,011 --> 01:15:05,775
- Do they know who did it?
- No.

1010
01:15:05,947 --> 01:15:09,815
Oh, Lon, when I think of all those
awful people you come in contact with...

1011
01:15:09,985 --> 01:15:13,079
...downright criminals,
I get scared.

1012
01:15:14,322 --> 01:15:18,258
Oh, there's nothing's
so different about them.

1013
01:15:19,661 --> 01:15:22,323
After all, crime is only...

1014
01:15:22,497 --> 01:15:25,591
...a left-handed form
of human endeavor.

1015
01:15:31,306 --> 01:15:33,797
- Ever been in Mexico City, Dix?
- Nope.

1016
01:15:33,975 --> 01:15:37,433
It's 8000 feet up.
The air is very pure.

1017
01:15:37,846 --> 01:15:41,338
Many first-class clubs,
restaurants, a horse track...

1018
01:15:41,516 --> 01:15:43,143
...and girls.

1019
01:15:43,485 --> 01:15:45,146
Beautiful young girls.

1020
01:15:45,821 --> 01:15:48,119
How would you like to go there,
all expenses paid?

1021
01:15:48,290 --> 01:15:50,656
Sorry, Doc, not interested.
I'm heading home.

1022
01:15:51,326 --> 01:15:53,351
Listen, Dix.
You can always go home.

1023
01:15:53,528 --> 01:15:55,325
And when you do, it's nothing.

1024
01:15:55,497 --> 01:15:58,227
Believe me. I've done it. Nothing.

1025
01:15:58,834 --> 01:16:00,961
My mind's made up.

1026
01:16:01,369 --> 01:16:02,996
It's me.

1027
01:16:04,105 --> 01:16:05,970
Look, my friends.

1028
01:16:06,875 --> 01:16:08,570
My friends...

1029
01:16:08,944 --> 01:16:10,912
...I am a respectable man.

1030
01:16:11,079 --> 01:16:14,879
For Gus, I do a favor, all right?
With this picture in the paper...

1031
01:16:15,050 --> 01:16:17,644
You mean you want us to blow?
Is that right, Eddie? Okay.

1032
01:16:17,819 --> 01:16:20,344
The sooner we get out of here,
the better.

1033
01:16:20,555 --> 01:16:23,524
Eddie's getting to the place where
he'd talk with encouragement.

1034
01:16:23,692 --> 01:16:25,592
Oh, no. I no talk.

1035
01:16:25,760 --> 01:16:27,751
Gus cut my belly open.

1036
01:16:27,929 --> 01:16:30,363
I'm sorry, my friends,
to bring you this bad news.

1037
01:16:30,532 --> 01:16:32,898
- I go now, please.
- Sit down, Donato.

1038
01:16:33,068 --> 01:16:35,832
You're not going anyplace till I say so.

1039
01:16:38,840 --> 01:16:40,239
Stay put, Eddie.

1040
01:16:40,408 --> 01:16:44,208
Nobody's gonna hurt you, so long as you
sit still and keep your mouth shut.

1041
01:16:45,814 --> 01:16:50,046
The way I figure, the insurance guys sicced
the cops on that phony, and he spilled.

1042
01:16:50,819 --> 01:16:53,117
You never should've stopped me
from blasting him.

1043
01:16:53,555 --> 01:16:55,819
No, Dix. He hasn't spilled...

1044
01:16:55,991 --> 01:16:59,358
...or they wouldn't be looking for just me.
- Then how come?

1045
01:16:59,527 --> 01:17:03,327
Because there's only three or four men
who can manage a job like this.

1046
01:17:03,498 --> 01:17:07,696
Somebody in the department with
a few brains has decided I'm the guy.

1047
01:17:07,869 --> 01:17:09,427
I've been half-expecting it.

1048
01:17:09,604 --> 01:17:11,435
It doesn't worry me much.

1049
01:17:11,606 --> 01:17:14,336
We'll get our money tomorrow, you bet.

1050
01:17:14,509 --> 01:17:16,067
I hope so.

1051
01:17:16,244 --> 01:17:18,906
- Where are we going, Dix?
- I know a place.

1052
01:17:19,080 --> 01:17:23,813
Eddie, if you're a smart boy,
you'll forget you ever seen us.

1053
01:17:30,258 --> 01:17:32,726
- I wanna see the commissioner.
- State your business.

1054
01:17:32,894 --> 01:17:35,988
I'm a citizen. I can see the
commissioner if I want to, can't I?

1055
01:17:36,164 --> 01:17:38,257
- Is it about Riedenschneider?
- Could be.

1056
01:17:38,833 --> 01:17:40,630
He sure gets around, that guy.

1057
01:17:40,802 --> 01:17:43,566
About 5000 people have seen him
in the last 24 hours.

1058
01:17:44,439 --> 01:17:47,602
If you get in that line and wait your turn,
you can tell your story.

1059
01:17:47,776 --> 01:17:51,473
- I won't tell anybody but the commissioner.
- Okay. Sit down and wait, buddy.

1060
01:17:51,646 --> 01:17:54,376
- But it may be some time.
- Okay.

1061
01:17:55,050 --> 01:17:57,177
I'd like to see the commissioner.

1062
01:18:10,532 --> 01:18:12,090
Where do you think you're going?

1063
01:18:12,634 --> 01:18:14,864
- We're on our way home.
- Yeah?

1064
01:18:15,270 --> 01:18:17,363
- Where do you live?
- South on Camden.

1065
01:18:17,539 --> 01:18:20,770
You got no business here.
This is city property. There are signs.

1066
01:18:21,476 --> 01:18:23,341
- Everybody uses it.
- You're telling me.

1067
01:18:23,511 --> 01:18:25,741
Even hoodlums have been
bringing girls here.

1068
01:18:25,914 --> 01:18:27,643
- Is that a fact?
- Yeah.

1069
01:18:27,816 --> 01:18:30,649
It's cost one of our boys his job,
on account of the beefs.

1070
01:18:30,819 --> 01:18:33,253
If I were you, I'd stay out of here.
You understand?

1071
01:18:33,421 --> 01:18:35,116
Okay, officer.

1072
01:18:37,258 --> 01:18:39,158
Hey, wait a minute.
You, with the bag.

1073
01:18:39,928 --> 01:18:41,691
Come here.

1074
01:19:24,606 --> 01:19:26,130
Dix!

1075
01:19:28,043 --> 01:19:29,670
Oh, Dix, honey.

1076
01:19:30,812 --> 01:19:32,370
You'll have to excuse me.

1077
01:19:32,547 --> 01:19:36,244
I took a couple of sleeping pills,
and I guess I'm still kind of groggy.

1078
01:19:36,418 --> 01:19:39,046
I haven't been able
to sleep much lately, Dix...

1079
01:19:39,220 --> 01:19:41,245
...worrying about you
and everything.

1080
01:19:41,423 --> 01:19:43,015
I was up at your place.

1081
01:19:43,191 --> 01:19:45,091
They told me the cops
were after you.

1082
01:19:45,260 --> 01:19:47,888
Get me some cold water
and some towels and stop yapping.

1083
01:19:48,063 --> 01:19:49,860
Sure, Dix. Sure.

1084
01:19:50,031 --> 01:19:51,862
- Get a move on.
- Oh, you bet.

1085
01:19:52,033 --> 01:19:54,001
Put in hours and hours of planning.

1086
01:19:54,169 --> 01:19:58,538
Figure everything down
to the last detail. Then what?

1087
01:19:58,706 --> 01:20:02,403
Burglar alarms start going off
all over the place for no sensible reason.

1088
01:20:02,577 --> 01:20:04,977
A gun fires of its own accord,
and a man is shot.

1089
01:20:05,146 --> 01:20:08,479
A broken-down old harness bull,
no good for anything but chasing kids...

1090
01:20:08,650 --> 01:20:09,776
...has to trip over us.

1091
01:20:09,951 --> 01:20:13,182
Blind accident.
What can you do against blind accident?

1092
01:20:13,354 --> 01:20:15,515
One thing I ought to have
figured was Emmerich.

1093
01:20:15,690 --> 01:20:18,386
I know why I didn't.
I'm not kidding myself.

1094
01:20:18,560 --> 01:20:20,391
It was the extra dough he promised.

1095
01:20:20,562 --> 01:20:23,690
I got hungry.
Greed made me blind.

1096
01:20:23,865 --> 01:20:27,266
Hey, Dix. Dix, isn't he the one
with the reward on him?

1097
01:20:27,435 --> 01:20:29,494
Mind your own business.

1098
01:20:32,173 --> 01:20:35,665
She confirmed what Emmerich said,
that he was with her from 11:30 till 3.

1099
01:20:35,844 --> 01:20:38,005
- How did she impress you?
- Very much.

1100
01:20:38,179 --> 01:20:40,374
- She's some babe.
- That's not what I mean.

1101
01:20:40,548 --> 01:20:42,413
Was her manner straightforward?

1102
01:20:42,584 --> 01:20:45,678
Oh, I guess she was
telling the truth, all right.

1103
01:20:45,854 --> 01:20:48,118
Married 20 years,
consorting with a woman...

1104
01:20:48,289 --> 01:20:50,883
...young enough to be his granddaughter.
It's disgusting.

1105
01:20:51,059 --> 01:20:53,186
But nothing about Emmerich
would surprise me.

1106
01:20:53,361 --> 01:20:55,795
Educated man who uses brains
to circumvent the law.

1107
01:20:55,964 --> 01:20:58,159
Worst type of human being.
No excuse for him.

1108
01:20:58,333 --> 01:20:59,891
- Excuse me, commissioner.
- Well?

1109
01:21:00,068 --> 01:21:02,093
There's a taxi driver
been waiting outside.

1110
01:21:02,270 --> 01:21:05,034
- Says he's got some important information.
- Concerning what?

1111
01:21:05,206 --> 01:21:08,266
I tried to find out, but he
wouldn't talk to anyone but you.

1112
01:21:08,443 --> 01:21:09,967
He's been waiting two hours.

1113
01:21:10,145 --> 01:21:12,113
- All right, send him in.
- Yes, sir.

1114
01:21:16,784 --> 01:21:18,376
- What's your name?
- Charles Wright.

1115
01:21:18,553 --> 01:21:21,113
Hackie number 14803.
Green Stripe Company.

1116
01:21:21,289 --> 01:21:24,690
- What's this information you've got?
- That doctor everybody's looking for.

1117
01:21:24,859 --> 01:21:27,419
- I think I had him for a fare.
- You drove him someplace?

1118
01:21:27,595 --> 01:21:32,362
Well, now, I'm pretty sure it was him I
picked up at the station a week ago Friday.

1119
01:21:32,534 --> 01:21:34,468
Friday the 16th?
Where did you take him?

1120
01:21:34,636 --> 01:21:36,399
To a number on Camden West.

1121
01:21:36,571 --> 01:21:38,869
I remember I asked him
if he wanted me to wait.

1122
01:21:39,040 --> 01:21:41,668
I know a fella that got
rolled once on Camden West.

1123
01:21:41,843 --> 01:21:44,004
He didn't have nothing,
so they stole his pants.

1124
01:21:44,179 --> 01:21:46,204
Where did you take him?
What number?

1125
01:21:47,749 --> 01:21:50,946
4717. Kind of a storeroom.
It was dark.

1126
01:21:51,119 --> 01:21:53,610
- What's that number again?
- 4717.

1127
01:21:53,788 --> 01:21:55,915
Used to be a bookie joint, commissioner.

1128
01:21:56,791 --> 01:21:58,918
Get hold of Lieutenant Ditrich.

1129
01:22:02,597 --> 01:22:03,962
Yeah, that's him.

1130
01:22:04,132 --> 01:22:07,329
At first I thought I was making
a fool of myself by coming down here.

1131
01:22:07,502 --> 01:22:09,094
But that's him, all right.

1132
01:22:09,270 --> 01:22:11,170
You may be in for a reward.
I hope so.

1133
01:22:11,339 --> 01:22:13,637
<i>Lieutenant Ditrich on one.</i>

1134
01:22:15,944 --> 01:22:18,344
- Where are you, Ditrich?
<i>- I'm at 4th Street and 6th.</i>

1135
01:22:18,513 --> 01:22:23,280
All right. Now, get a search warrant
and go to 4717 Camden West.

1136
01:22:23,451 --> 01:22:25,817
- Riedenschneider was seen there.
<i>- That's 4717?</i>

1137
01:22:25,987 --> 01:22:27,284
Yeah.

1138
01:22:27,455 --> 01:22:30,424
Stake your men out before
you go in. Get a move on.

1139
01:22:30,592 --> 01:22:31,854
Some news just came in.

1140
01:22:32,026 --> 01:22:35,757
A patrolman was on duty at the car barn.
He ran into two men and was slugged.

1141
01:22:35,930 --> 01:22:38,490
They got away, but he identified one
as Riedenschneider.

1142
01:22:38,666 --> 01:22:41,134
Good. Great.
We'll block off the whole area.

1143
01:22:41,302 --> 01:22:44,738
No sirens. We'll make it a sneak.
How about the patrolman? Badly hurt?

1144
01:22:45,006 --> 01:22:46,633
A head wound and he's punchy.

1145
01:22:46,808 --> 01:22:48,935
The doctor doesn't
think he's got a fracture.

1146
01:22:49,110 --> 01:22:52,568
Well, son, looks like maybe
we're getting somewhere at last.

1147
01:22:53,982 --> 01:22:56,507
Look, lieutenant,
what would I know about Belletier's?

1148
01:22:56,684 --> 01:22:58,777
I wouldn't mix into a robbery.
You know that.

1149
01:22:58,953 --> 01:23:00,750
- Wouldn't you?
- No, of course not!

1150
01:23:00,922 --> 01:23:02,947
You saw Riedenschneider here, sure.

1151
01:23:03,124 --> 01:23:04,614
- That don't say...
- You're nuts.

1152
01:23:04,792 --> 01:23:06,191
Never seen anybody here.

1153
01:23:06,361 --> 01:23:09,853
How could I?
I never been here before this.

1154
01:23:11,099 --> 01:23:13,590
Well, that being the case...

1155
01:23:13,768 --> 01:23:16,100
...what's to connect me
with the Belletier job?

1156
01:23:16,537 --> 01:23:18,334
Somebody saw him here.
I don't know who.

1157
01:23:18,506 --> 01:23:20,303
Maybe you got a fink around.

1158
01:23:22,977 --> 01:23:25,445
Look. You're sure you
won't have one, lieutenant?

1159
01:23:25,613 --> 01:23:27,103
No, thanks.

1160
01:23:27,282 --> 01:23:29,750
I never drink while on duty.
It's against regulations.

1161
01:23:29,917 --> 01:23:32,351
Look, I got nothing to hide.

1162
01:23:32,520 --> 01:23:34,511
Riedenschneider holed up here.
He was broke.

1163
01:23:34,689 --> 01:23:36,919
I let him use one of the rooms
for a couple days.

1164
01:23:37,091 --> 01:23:40,993
I got tired of having him around.
I gave him a few bucks to get rid of him.

1165
01:23:41,162 --> 01:23:43,096
- Where did he go?
- I don't know.

1166
01:23:43,564 --> 01:23:44,963
I don't know.

1167
01:23:45,400 --> 01:23:48,892
Look, Cobby, do you figure me
for a pal, or don't you?

1168
01:23:49,070 --> 01:23:50,367
I sure do, lieutenant.

1169
01:23:50,538 --> 01:23:52,335
Then take my advice and turn state's.

1170
01:23:52,507 --> 01:23:54,407
We'll make a deal
with the commissioner.

1171
01:23:54,575 --> 01:23:58,102
- You won't get more than a year or two.
- Look, I'm clean.

1172
01:23:58,279 --> 01:24:00,372
I don't know where he went.
That's the truth.

1173
01:24:00,548 --> 01:24:02,482
They won't believe
you at headquarters.

1174
01:24:02,650 --> 01:24:04,811
When you tell them that,
they'd work you over.

1175
01:24:04,986 --> 01:24:08,422
You ain't the type that can take it.
You'd spill your guts in a half-hour.

1176
01:24:14,362 --> 01:24:16,353
Give me a break.

1177
01:24:16,731 --> 01:24:19,131
You came to make a pinch, sure.
But I'm not here.

1178
01:24:19,667 --> 01:24:21,897
I had to go to Chi on business.

1179
01:24:23,571 --> 01:24:24,833
You're right here, Cobby.

1180
01:24:25,406 --> 01:24:27,897
I've always treated you right, lieutenant.

1181
01:24:28,076 --> 01:24:29,805
Let me duck out.

1182
01:24:30,278 --> 01:24:32,906
- You can get away with it.
- No, I couldn't.

1183
01:24:33,081 --> 01:24:35,276
The commissioner's mad.
He's out for blood.

1184
01:24:35,450 --> 01:24:37,975
And it's not going to be mine.

1185
01:24:39,387 --> 01:24:40,820
You're not gonna stop me!

1186
01:24:40,988 --> 01:24:43,388
You're gonna let me go!
You're gonna do that!

1187
01:24:43,558 --> 01:24:44,820
If you don't...

1188
01:24:44,992 --> 01:24:47,051
Yeah, I know.

1189
01:24:47,228 --> 01:24:48,820
You'll be a Grade A pigeon.

1190
01:24:48,996 --> 01:24:52,488
That's right. I'll tell them
you saw Riedenschneider here...

1191
01:24:52,667 --> 01:24:54,601
...and didn't roust him. Why?

1192
01:24:54,769 --> 01:24:57,169
You'd have to explain
what you were doing here.

1193
01:24:57,438 --> 01:24:59,770
I'll tell them about the juice
you've been getting.

1194
01:24:59,941 --> 01:25:02,034
The only thing you're doing
is making me sore.

1195
01:25:02,210 --> 01:25:04,041
Once I start singing, I won't stop!

1196
01:25:04,212 --> 01:25:06,043
They'll jug you right alongside of me!

1197
01:25:06,214 --> 01:25:07,613
That's where you're wrong.

1198
01:25:07,782 --> 01:25:10,307
Even if they believe you,
it won't go too hard with me.

1199
01:25:10,485 --> 01:25:14,216
Because I'll be the guy that cracked
the biggest case ever pulled in the country.

1200
01:25:14,922 --> 01:25:17,948
- You're gonna get hurt, Cobby.
- What, have you gone crazy?

1201
01:25:18,126 --> 01:25:19,718
Stand up!

1202
01:25:36,244 --> 01:25:38,508
I told you you couldn't take it, Cobby.

1203
01:25:38,679 --> 01:25:40,169
Here.

1204
01:25:45,286 --> 01:25:47,151
They'll call me a fink.

1205
01:25:47,321 --> 01:25:49,152
That's my boy.

1206
01:25:54,762 --> 01:25:58,425
So since I'm gonna be
busy with a lot of cases...

1207
01:25:58,599 --> 01:26:00,931
...you might like to take a trip.
- Where to?

1208
01:26:01,102 --> 01:26:03,502
I don't know. The coast, Florida.
Anywhere you like.

1209
01:26:03,671 --> 01:26:06,572
Could I, Uncle Lon?
Anywhere? No fooling?

1210
01:26:06,741 --> 01:26:09,938
Yes. I think a change of scenery
might be good for you.

1211
01:26:10,111 --> 01:26:13,979
Wait. You wait right here.
I've got the most terrific idea.

1212
01:26:21,122 --> 01:26:24,057
Oh, Cuba. There, that's not a bad idea.

1213
01:26:24,225 --> 01:26:27,661
Imagine me on this beach here
in my green bathing suit.

1214
01:26:28,396 --> 01:26:31,126
I almost bought a white one,
but it wasn't extreme enough.

1215
01:26:31,299 --> 01:26:35,326
If I really went in for the extreme extreme,
I would have bought a French one.

1216
01:26:35,503 --> 01:26:37,903
Run for your lives, girls.
The fleet's in.

1217
01:26:38,072 --> 01:26:40,870
Oh, Uncle Lon, am I excited!

1218
01:26:43,110 --> 01:26:46,978
Look, Uncle Lon. Isn't it romantic?
Real palms and ocean and everything!

1219
01:26:49,317 --> 01:26:51,410
Who can that be this time of night?

1220
01:26:53,588 --> 01:26:55,749
See who it is, Uncle Lon.

1221
01:26:58,125 --> 01:27:00,355
Why are they pounding so?

1222
01:27:00,795 --> 01:27:03,229
I'm scared, Uncle Lon.

1223
01:27:09,604 --> 01:27:12,698
Well, young man,
you've got an iron fist...

1224
01:27:12,874 --> 01:27:14,671
Oh, hello, Hardy. Come in.

1225
01:27:22,450 --> 01:27:25,977
Well, there's a fire in here.
Come on in. You look cold.

1226
01:27:36,264 --> 01:27:38,562
I'm here to arrest you, Emmerich.

1227
01:27:42,770 --> 01:27:44,863
May I ask what for?

1228
01:27:45,039 --> 01:27:48,702
Complicity in robbery and in murder.

1229
01:27:49,610 --> 01:27:52,875
If I were you, Hardy,
I'd think up a few more charges.

1230
01:27:53,047 --> 01:27:55,106
You might make
one of them stand up...

1231
01:27:55,283 --> 01:27:58,980
...if you get an imbecile jury
and the right judge.

1232
01:27:59,387 --> 01:28:02,185
- Get the young lady.
- Yes, sir.

1233
01:28:05,126 --> 01:28:09,085
It may interest you to know that your
friend Cobb has signed a confession.

1234
01:28:10,164 --> 01:28:13,099
Want to take a look at it? Here.

1235
01:28:22,577 --> 01:28:26,240
Okay, miss. It's a shame to bust
this door in, but here goes.

1236
01:28:26,414 --> 01:28:28,848
Haven't you bothered me enough,
you big banana-head?

1237
01:28:29,016 --> 01:28:32,383
Just try breaking my door,
and Mr. Emmerich will throw you out.

1238
01:28:32,687 --> 01:28:35,713
Afraid not, miss.
He's got troubles enough.

1239
01:28:35,890 --> 01:28:37,824
As a matter of fact, he's a dead duck.

1240
01:28:37,992 --> 01:28:40,153
Hurry up, Andrews.
Bring the young lady in here.

1241
01:28:41,829 --> 01:28:43,956
Do I have to talk to him?

1242
01:28:44,932 --> 01:28:47,696
Couldn't I just talk to you?

1243
01:28:48,769 --> 01:28:50,259
Come on, baby.

1244
01:28:50,605 --> 01:28:52,436
Get it over with.

1245
01:28:53,574 --> 01:28:56,441
And be smart.
Tell the commissioner the truth.

1246
01:28:57,111 --> 01:28:58,840
That's the only thing to do.

1247
01:28:59,780 --> 01:29:01,748
Come on.

1248
01:29:09,690 --> 01:29:11,317
Sit down.

1249
01:29:11,592 --> 01:29:15,358
Andrews, repeat the statement Miss Phinlay
made before you yesterday afternoon.

1250
01:29:15,529 --> 01:29:21,331
She said Mr. Emmerich was here with her
from 11:30 p.m. To 3 a.m. Last Friday night.

1251
01:29:21,502 --> 01:29:23,766
Is that the statement you made?

1252
01:29:24,138 --> 01:29:26,868
- Yes, sir.
- Was it the truth?

1253
01:29:32,446 --> 01:29:34,175
You better think before you answer...

1254
01:29:34,348 --> 01:29:36,873
...unless you wanna go to jail.
- Jail?

1255
01:29:37,051 --> 01:29:41,044
For setting up a false alibi to keep
another from being punished for a crime.

1256
01:29:42,089 --> 01:29:45,718
- Mr. Emmerich wouldn't commit a crime.
- He would and did.

1257
01:29:49,296 --> 01:29:50,558
Tell him the truth.

1258
01:29:51,666 --> 01:29:53,531
- Uncle Lon.
- It's the only thing to do...

1259
01:29:53,701 --> 01:29:56,499
...unless you want to be indicted
for obstructing justice.

1260
01:29:56,671 --> 01:29:59,003
What I said yesterday was<i>...</i>

1261
01:29:59,907 --> 01:30:01,966
Well, it wasn't exactly...

1262
01:30:02,143 --> 01:30:03,405
I mean...

1263
01:30:04,278 --> 01:30:06,212
- It wasn't really the...
- Was it the truth?

1264
01:30:07,248 --> 01:30:08,510
No, sir.

1265
01:30:08,683 --> 01:30:10,913
- You weren't with Emmerich, were you?
- No, sir.

1266
01:30:11,085 --> 01:30:14,543
- You were someplace else, not with him.
- Yes, sir.

1267
01:30:14,722 --> 01:30:17,190
He told you what to say,
made you learn it by heart.

1268
01:30:19,293 --> 01:30:21,284
Answer me!

1269
01:30:21,729 --> 01:30:23,560
I mean, yes, sir!

1270
01:30:23,731 --> 01:30:25,358
I mean, I learned it by heart!

1271
01:30:27,168 --> 01:30:29,898
Get a new statement from her.
Have her sign it.

1272
01:30:30,071 --> 01:30:32,266
This time, young lady,
I want the whole truth.

1273
01:30:33,340 --> 01:30:34,830
Over here, miss.

1274
01:30:40,281 --> 01:30:42,772
I'm sorry, Uncle Lon.

1275
01:30:42,950 --> 01:30:45,214
I tried.

1276
01:30:45,386 --> 01:30:48,287
You did pretty well, considering.

1277
01:30:50,858 --> 01:30:54,419
What about my trip, Uncle Lon?
Is it still on?

1278
01:30:55,162 --> 01:30:57,756
Don't worry, baby.
You'll have plenty of trips.

1279
01:31:02,937 --> 01:31:04,734
Seems to be all wrapped up, Emmerich.

1280
01:31:07,808 --> 01:31:09,605
Oh, here.

1281
01:31:09,777 --> 01:31:13,235
Say, I'd like to telephone my wife,
if you don't mind.

1282
01:31:13,414 --> 01:31:15,177
Getting late. She might be worried.

1283
01:31:15,349 --> 01:31:18,546
Help yourself. But don't try to run.
You won't get very far.

1284
01:32:17,545 --> 01:32:19,137
Emmerich!

1285
01:32:44,939 --> 01:32:47,203
- Stop! Stop!
- Come on!

1286
01:32:47,374 --> 01:32:49,239
- You wait and see...
- Break loose!

1287
01:32:49,410 --> 01:32:52,311
You dirty fink. You're gonna
wind up where you belong.

1288
01:32:52,479 --> 01:32:55,915
You're gonna wind up in the morgue!
You wait and see, you dirty fink!

1289
01:32:56,083 --> 01:32:57,778
Home of the pigeons!

1290
01:32:57,952 --> 01:32:59,510
Fink! Fink!

1291
01:33:04,425 --> 01:33:06,120
Fire escape.

1292
01:33:13,968 --> 01:33:15,595
We're looking for Louis Ciavelli.

1293
01:33:22,509 --> 01:33:25,410
I'd consider it a great favor
if you didn't insist on going in.

1294
01:33:25,579 --> 01:33:28,980
Mrs. Ciavelli is, well,
I don't have to tell you.

1295
01:33:29,149 --> 01:33:31,709
If the father says it's okay,
Williams, it's okay.

1296
01:33:31,886 --> 01:33:34,855
- Call the commissioner's office.
- The commissioner knows me.

1297
01:33:35,022 --> 01:33:37,991
- Mention my name. Sortino.
- Thank you, Father.

1298
01:33:38,158 --> 01:33:41,184
"Emmerich was a graduate of
the law college of State University...

1299
01:33:41,362 --> 01:33:44,024
...and had practiced here
for over 25 years."

1300
01:33:44,198 --> 01:33:46,063
What foolishness. Unbelievable.

1301
01:33:46,233 --> 01:33:48,224
He wouldn't have gotten
more than two years.

1302
01:33:48,402 --> 01:33:51,030
He even double-crossed himself.
How's your head, Doc?

1303
01:33:51,205 --> 01:33:54,003
Good as it ever was,
which isn't saying much.

1304
01:33:54,174 --> 01:33:57,268
You know, getting out of town's
not gonna be a cinch for you.

1305
01:33:57,444 --> 01:33:59,776
Oh, I'll get out, all right.

1306
01:33:59,947 --> 01:34:04,077
I'll take a taxi to the edge of town,
then have him drive me as far as Cleveland.

1307
01:34:04,985 --> 01:34:07,613
Sure you wouldn't come
along with me, Dix?

1308
01:34:07,888 --> 01:34:09,583
Keep it.

1309
01:34:10,157 --> 01:34:11,522
No, thank you.

1310
01:34:11,692 --> 01:34:13,717
If you won't come,
will you finance me?

1311
01:34:13,894 --> 01:34:16,385
I haven't got but 4 or 5 dollars.

1312
01:34:16,563 --> 01:34:18,690
Sure, I'll finance you.
How much you need?

1313
01:34:18,866 --> 01:34:21,801
I can get along on $ 1000,
thanks very much.

1314
01:34:21,969 --> 01:34:23,903
And you can have
the rest of these stones.

1315
01:34:24,071 --> 01:34:25,902
That's $50,000 worth.

1316
01:34:26,073 --> 01:34:29,668
What would I do? Can you see me
walking into a hockshop with that stuff?

1317
01:34:29,843 --> 01:34:33,335
First they'd think they were phony,
then they'd yell for the riot squad.

1318
01:34:33,514 --> 01:34:35,948
No. You can have the thousand,
but no rocks for me.

1319
01:34:36,617 --> 01:34:39,177
Well, thank you, Dix.

1320
01:34:40,754 --> 01:34:44,815
Tell me where to write you. At least I can
send you the 5 grand you got coming.

1321
01:34:44,992 --> 01:34:47,552
- What will your address be in Kentucky?
- Forget it.

1322
01:34:47,828 --> 01:34:49,455
Maybe I'll see you around.

1323
01:34:49,630 --> 01:34:51,097
Well...

1324
01:34:52,866 --> 01:34:55,460
...goodbye, then.
- Goodbye, Doc.

1325
01:34:56,403 --> 01:34:58,098
Hey, wait. You haven't got a heater.

1326
01:34:58,272 --> 01:35:00,763
I'd let you have mine,
but you got a gun, Doll?

1327
01:35:00,941 --> 01:35:03,967
No, Dix. I used to have one around,
but I guess somebody stole it.

1328
01:35:04,144 --> 01:35:05,372
I don't want a gun.

1329
01:35:05,546 --> 01:35:09,642
I haven't carried a gun since my 20s.
You carry a gun, you shoot a policeman.

1330
01:35:09,817 --> 01:35:11,307
Bad rap, hard to beat.

1331
01:35:11,485 --> 01:35:14,386
You don't carry a gun,
you give up and they hold one on you.

1332
01:35:14,588 --> 01:35:16,647
All right, Doc. You know best.

1333
01:35:31,905 --> 01:35:33,896
How about a cup of coffee, honey?

1334
01:35:34,074 --> 01:35:36,634
That squarehead.
He's a funny little guy.

1335
01:35:37,044 --> 01:35:38,534
I don't get him at all.

1336
01:35:38,712 --> 01:35:41,772
Maybe it's because he's a foreigner.
They just don't think like us.

1337
01:35:41,949 --> 01:35:43,883
I gotta get out of town too,
before morning.

1338
01:35:45,519 --> 01:35:47,316
Anyway, he's got plenty of guts.

1339
01:35:48,989 --> 01:35:51,924
- How about a cup of coffee, honey?
- Make it or shut up about it.

1340
01:35:52,092 --> 01:35:54,151
- It's that wound.
- Bright girl.

1341
01:35:54,328 --> 01:35:57,491
Dix, it's starting to bleed again.
I know, aspirin.

1342
01:36:12,112 --> 01:36:15,843
Pickering Avenue and Center Street.
You know where that is?

1343
01:36:16,016 --> 01:36:18,177
- The other side of town.
- How far is that?

1344
01:36:18,352 --> 01:36:21,344
- I can make it in an hour.
- Okay. I got relatives living there.

1345
01:36:21,522 --> 01:36:23,581
I'm between trains.
I got nothing else to do.

1346
01:36:23,757 --> 01:36:26,521
I know how it is.
I got relatives myself, on both sides.

1347
01:36:28,062 --> 01:36:29,723
Always writing me letters for money.

1348
01:36:33,033 --> 01:36:35,126
I haven't spoken German for a long time.

1349
01:36:35,302 --> 01:36:37,600
- You have a <i>Mnchen</i> accent.
- I was born there.

1350
01:36:37,771 --> 01:36:40,171
You know what they say,
"Home is where the money is."

1351
01:36:40,340 --> 01:36:41,773
- Yeah.
- Franz?

1352
01:36:41,942 --> 01:36:45,002
- Would you drive me to Cleveland?
- It's a long way, my friend.

1353
01:36:45,179 --> 01:36:47,647
But it would still be quicker
than to take the train.

1354
01:36:47,815 --> 01:36:50,249
- What about your relatives?
- Forget them.

1355
01:36:50,751 --> 01:36:53,311
Well, I don't know.
Cleveland, that's a long way.

1356
01:36:53,921 --> 01:36:56,617
- Costs a lot of money.
- There's a $50 tip for you.

1357
01:36:56,790 --> 01:37:00,556
- What do you say?
- For $50, I'd drive you to the North Pole.

1358
01:37:00,727 --> 01:37:03,218
Well, we better get gas
if we're going to Cleveland.

1359
01:37:03,397 --> 01:37:05,422
Let's not stop.
Wait till we get out of town.

1360
01:37:05,599 --> 01:37:06,930
We can do everything at once.

1361
01:37:07,101 --> 01:37:10,298
Have a little meal, beer, a cigar.
Go in comfort.

1362
01:37:10,671 --> 01:37:12,332
You're a man who likes
his pleasures.

1363
01:37:12,506 --> 01:37:16,101
Well, Franz, what else
is there in life, I ask you?

1364
01:37:25,986 --> 01:37:28,045
You've been gone two hours.
What happened?

1365
01:37:28,222 --> 01:37:30,383
It took time.
I was stopped twice, prowler cars.

1366
01:37:30,557 --> 01:37:32,957
The neighborhood's
crawling with coppers. Dix, you...

1367
01:37:33,127 --> 01:37:34,526
- Did you get a car?
- Yes.

1368
01:37:34,695 --> 01:37:37,186
Here's the change.
It only came to $400.

1369
01:37:37,364 --> 01:37:40,856
I got it from Big Vivian.
It's in pretty good shape, Dix, except...

1370
01:37:41,034 --> 01:37:42,365
- Did you put gas in it?
- Yes.

1371
01:37:42,536 --> 01:37:44,333
- Where is it parked?
- Three blocks away.

1372
01:37:44,505 --> 01:37:45,802
- Good girl.
- Dix.

1373
01:37:45,973 --> 01:37:47,804
- Yeah?
- I'm scared.

1374
01:37:47,975 --> 01:37:49,602
All those cops out there.

1375
01:37:49,776 --> 01:37:51,073
They don't worry me one bit.

1376
01:37:51,245 --> 01:37:54,681
I'll drive slow. Head down
the main boulevard, and in 10 hours...

1377
01:37:54,848 --> 01:37:56,145
...I'll be home.

1378
01:37:56,316 --> 01:37:58,147
How are you gonna
drive all that way?

1379
01:37:58,318 --> 01:37:59,615
- I'll make it.
- No!

1380
01:37:59,786 --> 01:38:01,811
Not in the shape you're in.

1381
01:38:01,989 --> 01:38:03,718
- I'll make it!
- Dix.

1382
01:38:05,325 --> 01:38:06,849
Let me go with you?

1383
01:38:07,161 --> 01:38:08,423
Please, Dix. Please.

1384
01:38:08,595 --> 01:38:11,359
Are you crazy? I'm on the lam.
I'm wanted bad, packing heat.

1385
01:38:11,532 --> 01:38:13,762
- What good would you be?
- I could drive!

1386
01:38:15,469 --> 01:38:17,630
No, Doll. I'm wanted on a killing rap.

1387
01:38:17,804 --> 01:38:19,965
I don't care.
I just want to be with you.

1388
01:38:22,576 --> 01:38:25,136
You can't go without me.
I won't let you.

1389
01:38:25,846 --> 01:38:28,246
I won't tell you where the car is.

1390
01:38:32,986 --> 01:38:34,419
I don't get it.

1391
01:38:35,355 --> 01:38:36,982
I just don't get it.

1392
01:38:38,959 --> 01:38:41,291
All right, kid. Get your things packed.

1393
01:39:08,222 --> 01:39:09,621
Come on, let's play some more.

1394
01:39:09,790 --> 01:39:12,054
I'm fresh out of nickels, Jeannie.
How about you?

1395
01:39:12,226 --> 01:39:14,319
- I'm always fresh out.
- Well, get some.

1396
01:39:14,494 --> 01:39:16,553
You know, you can cost a guy
a lot of dough.

1397
01:39:16,730 --> 01:39:19,198
Nickels he's complaining about.
What a spender.

1398
01:39:19,766 --> 01:39:22,098
Sure, he wants a date.
He always wants a date.

1399
01:39:22,269 --> 01:39:24,897
And where do we go?
To a third-run movie.

1400
01:39:25,072 --> 01:39:27,199
Then we take a ride
and blow two tires.

1401
01:39:27,374 --> 01:39:30,207
Then we come in here,
and what do you treat me to? Cokes.

1402
01:39:31,211 --> 01:39:32,803
- That's for you.
- Thanks.

1403
01:39:32,980 --> 01:39:36,040
- Would you have change for this in nickels?
- Sure thing.

1404
01:39:36,216 --> 01:39:38,810
At least you could dig for enough
to play me some music.

1405
01:39:38,986 --> 01:39:40,613
Jeannie, cut it out.

1406
01:39:40,787 --> 01:39:42,516
Excuse me, boys.

1407
01:39:42,689 --> 01:39:45,681
Young lady, I like music too.

1408
01:39:47,261 --> 01:39:49,923
- Would you play me a tune?
- Sure. What do you want?

1409
01:39:50,097 --> 01:39:52,395
- You pick them.
- Gosh, how many have you got here?

1410
01:39:52,566 --> 01:39:56,127
- Not very many. Play what you like.
- Okay.

1411
01:40:50,190 --> 01:40:51,714
Mister.

1412
01:40:52,859 --> 01:40:55,555
Mister. It's getting late.

1413
01:40:58,298 --> 01:41:00,198
Mister, we better be moving along.

1414
01:41:00,367 --> 01:41:03,825
Plenty of time, my friend. Plenty of time.

1415
01:41:08,775 --> 01:41:11,573
Look, mister, it's a long way to Cleveland.

1416
01:41:15,515 --> 01:41:18,177
Well, I suppose we better go now.

1417
01:41:18,352 --> 01:41:21,116
- Don't go. We haven't used all the nickels.
- You use them.

1418
01:41:21,288 --> 01:41:23,620
- Thanks. It's sure nice of you.
- Don't mention it.

1419
01:41:23,790 --> 01:41:26,224
Goodbye and thanks.
Thanks ever so much.

1420
01:41:26,393 --> 01:41:28,327
Pleasure was all mine.

1421
01:41:50,016 --> 01:41:52,280
You men want something?

1422
01:41:52,452 --> 01:41:54,181
What do you think, Ed?

1423
01:41:54,354 --> 01:41:56,754
Might be the number-one boy.

1424
01:41:56,923 --> 01:41:58,515
- Just might be.
- Say, what is this?

1425
01:41:58,692 --> 01:42:00,455
- Shut up.
- Better frisk him.

1426
01:42:00,627 --> 01:42:02,492
- Go right ahead.
- Put up your hands.

1427
01:42:02,662 --> 01:42:04,527
You have me mixed up with somebody else.

1428
01:42:04,698 --> 01:42:07,599
I'm from Cleveland, the importing business.
My name's Kremper.

1429
01:42:07,768 --> 01:42:09,633
Nothing there.
Let me see that coat.

1430
01:42:09,803 --> 01:42:12,067
- You're making a big...
- Shut up. Stay out of this.

1431
01:42:12,239 --> 01:42:15,470
Bill, better phone the city
and check on the description.

1432
01:42:18,044 --> 01:42:19,636
We don't need a description.

1433
01:42:19,813 --> 01:42:21,246
I'll tell them we got him.

1434
01:42:24,317 --> 01:42:27,411
- Okay, mister. Keep those hands up.
- Of course.

1435
01:42:27,587 --> 01:42:30,283
Excuse me, officer,
but will you tell me something?

1436
01:42:30,457 --> 01:42:32,721
Maybe. Just keep your face front.

1437
01:42:32,893 --> 01:42:34,656
How long have you been out here?

1438
01:42:34,828 --> 01:42:37,820
- That's a darn funny question.
- It's not important.

1439
01:42:37,998 --> 01:42:41,024
We've been watching you
through that window two, three minutes.

1440
01:42:41,201 --> 01:42:44,932
Yes. Say, about as long as it takes
to play a phonograph record.

1441
01:42:45,105 --> 01:42:47,232
How's that again?
What are you talking about?

1442
01:42:47,407 --> 01:42:49,637
- It doesn't matter.
- Keep your face front.

1443
01:42:49,810 --> 01:42:51,778
You mind if I smoke a cigar?

1444
01:42:51,945 --> 01:42:55,813
Just stand quiet there, mister.
We'll talk about smoking a cigar later.

1445
01:42:55,982 --> 01:42:58,542
Certainly, officer. Certainly.

1446
01:43:04,157 --> 01:43:06,057
How you feeling now, Dix?

1447
01:43:06,226 --> 01:43:09,662
All right. Cold.
Didn't used to get cold this time of year.

1448
01:43:13,533 --> 01:43:15,967
Why don't you let me drive
for a while, honey.

1449
01:43:16,136 --> 01:43:17,569
You don't know the way.

1450
01:43:17,737 --> 01:43:20,171
I don't wanna have to keep telling you.

1451
01:43:20,674 --> 01:43:22,301
Much longer, Dix?

1452
01:43:22,476 --> 01:43:25,274
Dix. Dix.

1453
01:43:25,445 --> 01:43:26,707
Dix!

1454
01:43:38,058 --> 01:43:39,616
Dix.

1455
01:43:55,242 --> 01:43:57,233
Mister! Mister!

1456
01:43:57,410 --> 01:43:59,310
Mister!

1457
01:43:59,980 --> 01:44:02,107
You gotta help me.
I gotta find a doctor.

1458
01:44:02,282 --> 01:44:03,681
My husband, he's sick.

1459
01:44:03,850 --> 01:44:05,078
Come on. I'll show you.

1460
01:44:05,252 --> 01:44:07,948
Go straight on, ma'am.
Down to the end of the block.

1461
01:44:08,121 --> 01:44:12,148
We'll get Doc Swanson.
He lives right near here, on Elm Street.

1462
01:44:30,477 --> 01:44:32,274
My husband, he's sick. Save him!

1463
01:44:32,445 --> 01:44:36,939
Get him inside here where I can look at him.
Right in this other room here, please.

1464
01:44:40,620 --> 01:44:42,349
On the table.

1465
01:44:42,522 --> 01:44:44,285
Take his coat off.

1466
01:44:47,894 --> 01:44:49,555
On the chair.

1467
01:45:09,316 --> 01:45:12,547
This man's been hemorrhaging.
He's lost a lot of blood. What happened?

1468
01:45:12,719 --> 01:45:15,051
He was hurt.
He was hurt in an auto accident.

1469
01:45:15,221 --> 01:45:18,452
- How long has this wound been let go?
- A couple of days.

1470
01:45:18,625 --> 01:45:21,753
Is it bad, doctor?
Is he hurt real bad?

1471
01:45:21,928 --> 01:45:23,828
It's not good.

1472
01:45:26,333 --> 01:45:28,927
- You got a good, strong arm?
- Good as any, Doc, I guess.

1473
01:45:29,102 --> 01:45:31,627
Come around here
and hold this for me, please.

1474
01:45:34,107 --> 01:45:35,870
That's right.

1475
01:45:37,677 --> 01:45:39,110
There we are.

1476
01:45:47,954 --> 01:45:52,914
Hello. Let me talk to Tom.
This is Dr. Swanson. Well, wake him up!

1477
01:45:55,061 --> 01:45:57,723
- I'm thirsty. Get me a drink of water.
- Sure, Dix. Sure.

1478
01:45:57,897 --> 01:46:01,560
Lie down, sweetheart. Please lie down.

1479
01:46:02,335 --> 01:46:03,802
Hello, sheriff.

1480
01:46:03,970 --> 01:46:07,269
This is Tom. I got a man here
with a gunshot wound. Pretty bad.

1481
01:46:07,440 --> 01:46:09,874
- Here, sweetheart.
- Who's that?

1482
01:46:10,043 --> 01:46:13,342
I had to take you to the doctor's, Dix.
I couldn't help it.

1483
01:46:13,513 --> 01:46:16,482
Hold him? I don't have to.
The man's unconscious.

1484
01:46:17,050 --> 01:46:19,177
No, no, no. He's a stranger to me.

1485
01:46:19,352 --> 01:46:22,913
His wife's with him.
She says it was an auto accident.

1486
01:46:24,591 --> 01:46:26,024
Dix.

1487
01:46:28,762 --> 01:46:31,128
Dix. Dix!

1488
01:46:43,343 --> 01:46:45,811
Well, he won't get very far,
that's for sure.

1489
01:46:45,979 --> 01:46:49,380
He hasn't got enough blood left in him
to keep a chicken alive.

1490
01:46:50,583 --> 01:46:53,484
- Any more questions?
- I don't like to harp on the same point...

1491
01:46:53,653 --> 01:46:56,315
...but what about Ditrich?
If the past of the department...

1492
01:46:56,489 --> 01:46:59,515
He's in jail and he'll go to trial.
He'll be tried by 12 citizens.

1493
01:46:59,693 --> 01:47:03,390
The people he's worked for. Let them
show justice or compassion as they see fit.

1494
01:47:03,563 --> 01:47:06,691
- What would be your verdict, commissioner?
- I'm not sure.

1495
01:47:06,866 --> 01:47:09,733
I'm not sure at all.
Let me put it this way.

1496
01:47:09,903 --> 01:47:14,033
It's not anything strange that there
are corrupt officers in police departments.

1497
01:47:14,207 --> 01:47:17,836
The dirt they're trying to clean up
is bound to rub off on some, but not all.

1498
01:47:18,011 --> 01:47:19,444
Maybe one out of 100.

1499
01:47:19,612 --> 01:47:23,548
The other 99 are honest men
trying to do an honest job.

1500
01:47:24,918 --> 01:47:27,284
<i>- Robbery at 193 Scully Avenue.</i>
- Listen.

1501
01:47:27,454 --> 01:47:29,183
<i>All units, robbery at 193...</i>

1502
01:47:29,355 --> 01:47:31,880
<i>- two male Caucasians,</i>
<i>armed with blue steel...</i>

1503
01:47:32,058 --> 01:47:34,618
I know you're police reporters
and hear this all day...

1504
01:47:34,794 --> 01:47:37,456
...but listen with your conscience,
not just your ears.

1505
01:47:37,630 --> 01:47:39,564
<i>- wearing a brown felt hat...</i>

1506
01:47:39,733 --> 01:47:42,224
<i>- a shooting at 25 James Boulevard.</i>
<i>Woman screaming.</i>

1507
01:47:42,402 --> 01:47:45,496
<i>Car 12, shooting at</i>
<i>25 James Boulevard. Woman...</i>

1508
01:47:45,672 --> 01:47:48,573
<i>All units, strong-arm slugging,</i>
<i>3216 River Drive...</i>

1509
01:47:48,742 --> 01:47:51,074
We send police assistance
to each of those calls...

1510
01:47:51,244 --> 01:47:54,702
...because they're not just codes
on a radio, they're cries for help.

1511
01:47:54,881 --> 01:47:58,647
People are being cheated,
robbed, murdered, raped.

1512
01:47:58,818 --> 01:48:02,914
And that goes on 24 hours a day,
every day in the year.

1513
01:48:03,089 --> 01:48:05,353
And that's not exceptional, that's usual.

1514
01:48:05,525 --> 01:48:08,289
It's the same in every city
of the modern world.

1515
01:48:08,461 --> 01:48:11,328
But suppose we had no police force,
good or bad.

1516
01:48:11,498 --> 01:48:13,398
Suppose we had...

1517
01:48:15,969 --> 01:48:17,766
...just silence.

1518
01:48:17,937 --> 01:48:19,928
Nobody to listen. Nobody to answer.

1519
01:48:20,273 --> 01:48:23,140
The battle's finished.
The jungle wins.

1520
01:48:23,309 --> 01:48:25,470
The predatory beasts take over.

1521
01:48:25,645 --> 01:48:27,340
Think about it.

1522
01:48:28,648 --> 01:48:30,513
Well, gentlemen...

1523
01:48:30,683 --> 01:48:35,450
...three men are in jail, three men dead, one
by his own hand. One man's a fugitive...

1524
01:48:35,622 --> 01:48:38,147
...and we have reason to believe
seriously wounded.

1525
01:48:38,324 --> 01:48:40,815
That's six out of seven. Not bad.

1526
01:48:40,994 --> 01:48:42,825
And we'll get the last one too.

1527
01:48:43,129 --> 01:48:45,893
In some ways,
he's the most dangerous of them all.

1528
01:48:46,065 --> 01:48:48,863
A hardened killer. A hooligan.

1529
01:48:49,035 --> 01:48:52,664
A man without human feeling
or human mercy.

1530
01:49:23,803 --> 01:49:25,668
I tell you...

1531
01:49:25,839 --> 01:49:29,798
...the black one's the best
we ever had at Hickorywood.

1532
01:49:30,243 --> 01:49:31,870
The bay's all right, but...

1533
01:49:32,045 --> 01:49:35,446
...the black's a real good colt.

1534
01:49:36,049 --> 01:49:39,644
Prettiest way of<i>...</i>
Going of<i>...</i> Anything...

1535
01:49:40,386 --> 01:49:42,411
...Pa ever bred.

1536
01:49:43,256 --> 01:49:45,190
Easiest thing...

1537
01:49:45,358 --> 01:49:48,657
...but he's always way out front...

1538
01:49:48,828 --> 01:49:50,796
...of the other yearlings.

1539
01:49:51,998 --> 01:49:53,727
He's a stake horse...

1540
01:49:53,900 --> 01:49:56,061
...or I never saw one.

1541
01:49:56,469 --> 01:49:58,369
I sure hope...

1542
01:49:59,305 --> 01:50:01,296
...Pa don't sell him.

1543
01:50:03,910 --> 01:50:07,311
If Pa just hangs on to that black colt...

1544
01:50:07,480 --> 01:50:11,143
...everything's gonna be all right.
- Oh, Dix. God!

1545
01:50:11,718 --> 01:50:13,015
I said it.

1546
01:50:13,186 --> 01:50:14,676
I'll say it again.

1547
01:50:14,854 --> 01:50:18,381
If Pa just hangs on to that black colt...

1548
01:50:18,558 --> 01:50:21,994
...everything's gonna be okay.

1549
01:50:31,871 --> 01:50:33,532
What's this...?

1550
01:51:03,002 --> 01:51:05,197
Oh, Dix!

1551
01:51:10,977 --> 01:51:12,410
Dix! Dix!

1552
01:51:12,578 --> 01:51:15,342
Oh, God. Oh, my God, Dix.

1553
01:51:15,515 --> 01:51:17,176
Dix.

1554
01:52:08,167 --> 01:52:10,158
