1
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:21,391
Life's an enigma, a puzzle, a confusing
struggle between right and wrong...

2
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:23,750
good and evil, truth and deceit.

3
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:26,792
You could drive yourself crazy
trying to figure it out.

4
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:28,990
But I know one thing for sure:

5
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:32,032
You're just buying someone else's
headaches when you get a used car.

6
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:11,672
Stop that run! Stop that run!

7
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:44,553
Night and day

8
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:46,955
You are the one

9
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:50,278
Only you beneath the moon

10
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:51,992
Before I got myself blown up...

11
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:55,396
Anthony Cortino was one of the most
powerful men in Las Vegas.

12
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:59,559
I ran the Peppermill, the flashiest,
most profitable casino in Nevada.

13
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:01,716
Hey, Barry.
Keep the car.

14
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:04,752
I drove the hottest cars,
hung out with the biggest stars...

15
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:06,359
dated the sexiest babes.

16
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:07,754
- Watch your head.
- I was set.

17
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:12,590
Night and day
Why is it so

18
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:14,312
I had created paradise on Earth...

19
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:17,079
and all because I ate, slept
and breathed gambling.

20
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:18,679
Hi.

21
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,199
- Loser. Seven out.
- Stack 'em right.

22
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:24,074
I was a gambler's gambler--
a guaranteed winner.

23
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:27,237
- That's just the way it was.
- Go fish.

24
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:31,035
The Peppermill meant cash. The money was
comin' in so fast we couldn't count it.

25
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:33,628
Watch these guys.
I think they're stealin' towels.

26
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:37,275
- And it all went right
to the family, tax-free.
- Back to yellow. You lose.

27
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:40,756
The high rollers, the slot junkies,
the vacationers from the Midwest...

28
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:43,838
all came certain they could win...

29
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:46,713
- that this was their shot at a miracle.
- Place your bets.

30
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:49,400
It's all been arranged just for us
to get your money.

31
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:52,592
Let me see. Uh, two.

32
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:54,517
That's the truth about Las Vegas:

33
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:58,110
I'm sorry.
I was thinking of three.

34
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:01,437
The Mafia is a high-overhead machine,
and somebody's gotta pick up the tab.

35
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:05,439
- House wins.
Place your bets and guess again.
- Three.

36
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:07,676
To the bosses, I was a cash register.

37
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:10,155
All they had to do was to ring the bell
and take the money.

38
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:12,714
One, two, three, four.

39
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:14,637
- Back down the chute.
- Whoa!

40
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:18,275
Fixed fights, doped horses,
locked-in point spreads.

41
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,550
- I had the cake pouring in.
- Come on, baby!

42
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:23,831
But nothing brought it in faster
and in bigger bundles than the casino.

43
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:25,871
- I'll get these. You get those.
- I'll get those! You got those?

44
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,594
- Yeah. You get these over here.
- All right, I got these.
- Whose are those?

45
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:32,759
This was the end result of all
of the bright lights and glitter.

46
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:36,350
- Booze, broads and free hotel suites
for the high roller...
- Put your backs to it, men.

47
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:40,996
cheap drinks and all-you-can-eat buffets
for the everyday sucker.

48
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:45,113
The smart ones just send us the money
and save on plane fare.

49
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:47,834
I think of you

50
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:50,758
Day and night

51
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:53,952
I said, night and day

52
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:57,834
Under the hide of me

53
00:03:57,960 --> 00:04:00,758
- All right, move' em out. Let's go.
- There's, oh, such a hungry yearnin'

54
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:02,757
It's burnin' inside

55
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:05,553
If we had our own printing press
we couldn't have done any better.

56
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:10,117
I made the Mafia happy, and the bosses
knew just how to spread the influence.

57
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:13,312
But life is an enigma.
I never planned for any of this.

58
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:15,874
And I'll lay you eight-to-five
when he was a kid back in Sicily...

59
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,309
my father, Vincenzo Cortino...

60
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:21,750
never thought his life would turn out
the way it did either.

61
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:34,352
Vincenzo!

62
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:31,869
Oops.

63
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:37,993
Wow! The colours!
Great shit!

64
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:53,349
The categories are:
the Chinese Theatre,

65
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:55,755
Female Firsts...

66
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:30,271
Documents, please.

67
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:32,038
The white zone
is for white people only.

68
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:35,072
That's right, one at a time.
Papers, please.

69
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:37,270
- Move along, sir.
- But we had reservations.

70
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:39,675
Next. Name?

71
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:42,189
- That's right, ma'am, your name.
- Sir, over here.

72
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:45,073
What's your name, boy?

73
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:47,919
- Step up, please.
- You next.

74
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:53,078
- Armani Windbreaker.
- Cortino.

75
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:58,115
Fine. Read this.
Stand over there.

76
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:00,754
- Next.
- Clamato!

77
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:04,509
Dominick Clamato!

78
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:06,995
I'm lookin' for Dominick Clamato!

79
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:09,873
- Sweat shop. Cheap wages.
- Clamato!

80
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:13,515
I'm lookin' for Dominick Clamato!

81
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:17,633
- Don't say nothin'.
- Dominick Clamato!

82
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:25,120
Gun.

83
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:37,396
- Where is your family?
- Family? No.

84
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:40,796
- Alone.
- That is so sad.

85
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:44,799
But when I close my eyes tight
I can picture them here.

86
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:54,116
When you squeeze your eyes closed,
do you see lots of things, eh...

87
00:15:57,080 --> 00:15:59,514
- Rectangles?
- No.

88
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:02,438
All I ever see
are those long, floaty things.

89
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:04,391
Ah. Eye worms.

90
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:06,590
In Sicily the peasants
used to get them...

91
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:09,359
by eating raw pork
and then rubbing their eyes.

92
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:11,436
Once the worms
get inside your eyeball...

93
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:15,189
it's just a matter of days before
they eat their way into your brain.

94
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:19,996
Then you shit yourself
and die in a most embarrassing way.

95
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:23,510
Rosa was not very attractive
by ltalian standards.

96
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:26,029
- Rosa, come.
- Hardly any body hair.

97
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:28,435
Come on.

98
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:38,755
Next.

99
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:52,588
Thanks for carryin' my luggage, pal.
I'll take my gun.

100
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:59,792
Don't be a fool.
Cops don't help our kind.

101
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:03,151
In this country,
we gotta look out for ourselves.

102
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:09,513
-No!
-Give me your money. Give me your money!

103
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:11,551
- Use the gun.
- No.

104
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:13,636
I will use my brain.
It is as big as any bullet.

105
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:18,356
- You won't look so pretty
without a nose.
- Why don't you pick a nose
your own size?

106
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:24,278
Look at you.
You're just a boy.

107
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:26,914
Think you can stop me?
How?

108
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:29,508
- I'll outsmart you.
- Oh, yeah?

109
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:33,474
Then answer me this:
A rooster sits on the peak of a roof.

110
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:36,910
It lays an egg.
Which side will the egg roll down?

111
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:40,032
The left--
No, the right.

112
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:44,239
- I don't know.
- Neither, my friend.

113
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:47,591
Roosters don't lay eggs.

114
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:54,948
This was no ordinary kid.

115
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:58,868
I had a feeling
we'd be seeing a lot of each other.

116
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,355
Stay in school.

117
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:12,874
Thank you.
I don't even know your name.

118
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:17,915
Uh, Vincenzo. Vincenzo
Armani Windbreaker Cortino. You?

119
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:21,919
I'm Rosa Versace Blue Blazer
And Matching Skirt Pantuzzi.

120
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:24,759
- Are you from Sicily too?
- No. Milano.

121
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:26,916
My father was in the military.
A lancer.

122
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:31,158
- Bengal Lancer?
- No, a boil lancer. One of the best.

123
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:35,796
But then one day
there were no more boils.

124
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:39,993
He turned to drink.
We lost him at a Grateful Dead concert.

125
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:46,430
Look! A falling star!

126
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:51,156
They say that if two people meeting
for the first time see a falling star...

127
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:54,033
their wish will come true.

128
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:56,435
Make a wish, Vincenzo.

129
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:08,314
I believe in America.

130
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:12,872
I raised my daughter
in American fashion.

131
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:16,754
One day she went to see a man.

132
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:20,475
He got her alone in a room.

133
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:23,637
Held her down in a chair.

134
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:27,958
When she resisted,
he stuck her with a needle.

135
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:30,992
Then, when she was helpless...

136
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:33,588
he took pliers and...

137
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:39,273
Look at her, Don Cortino.
Look.

138
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:45,194
I'm familiar with this Dr Mendelbaum.
He's not a dentist, he's a butcher.

139
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:47,959
Put caps on the Turteltaub twins.

140
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:52,039
I saw them.
They looked like beavers.

141
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:55,232
In fact, I have
a cord of wood they cut.

142
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:57,954
I'm all set for the winter.

143
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:01,548
Whoopsy-daisy!

144
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:05,115
Ah. I found my keys.

145
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:10,275
I must own a car.

146
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:16,798
A beautiful girl, Don Cortino.

147
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:20,799
A daughter who has brought only
happiness into our home for 17 years.

148
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:23,832
Horrible.
Can't really blame the boy.

149
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:36,075
Die, you bastard.

150
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:41,829
What is it you request?

151
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:57,395
Uh, that's my bad ear.

152
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:15,110
No, I was wrong.
This must be the bad ear.

153
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:22,672
Don Cortino, I want justice
for my Angelina.

154
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:25,872
All right, Bonifacio, all right.

155
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:30,234
I will do this thing for you.

156
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:33,875
Thank you, Godfather.

157
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:41,475
Thank you.

158
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:46,038
Diane was my first love.
We were made for each other.

159
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:49,311
About the only disagreement we ever had
was when I went to war.

160
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:52,591
While I was off fighting, she was
working for the world peace movement.

161
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:56,508
But despite all that, when I got home
she was there to greet me.

162
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:59,518
I guess she was a sucker
for a guy in uniform.

163
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:04,073
Oh, Anthony, I'm so nervous
about meeting your family.

164
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:07,954
- If they don't like me, I'll just die.
- Hey! Tony!

165
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:11,351
Big war hero.

166
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:16,833
- I got you a souvenir.
- No.

167
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:20,475
Oh, wow. A North Korean.

168
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:24,229
Tony-- I mean, I do--
I don't know what to say.

169
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:29,150
I want you to meet Diane.
Diane, this is Dominick Clamato,
my father's most trusted friend.

170
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:31,236
- Hi.
- Bella.

171
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:33,715
Lugosi.

172
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:40,678
Hey, you guys,
look at what Tony brung me.

173
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:42,916
I'll bet you never seen
one of these before.

174
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:46,953
Anthony, isn't that Cesar Marzoni? The
man's a criminal. What's he doing here?

175
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:49,389
Maybe he does business
with my father.

176
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:52,239
What are you saying?

177
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:55,716
Look, I'm not my father, Diane,
just as you're not your father.

178
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:59,196
If we were our fathers, what we did last
night would only be legal in Arkansas.

179
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:02,198
Hmm.

180
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:04,550
Some champagne, sir?

181
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:06,955
It was like I never left.

182
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:09,355
- These were the faces I grew up with.
- Good to see you, Anthony.

183
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:11,994
It wasn't just me and Joey and Pop.

184
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:14,315
- It was Frankie Totino,
- Look who's here.

185
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:17,876
Hey, Anthony, welcome back.

186
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,594
- "Fatso" Paulie Orsatti,
- Try the veal picatta.

187
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:23,439
who was Benny "Big Features'" brother--
he controlled the unions.

188
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:27,348
- Then you had Nick Molinaro,
who ran the North Side;
- Hey! How ya doin'?

189
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:29,789
Jumbo
"The King of Big Screen TV" DeNuzio.

190
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:33,276
Yo, Tony, I'll knock 20 percent
off that Trinitron for you.

191
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:36,312
- There was AI "The Mailbox" Faducci,
- Miller Lite.

192
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:38,476
- Johnny Love...
- Who's the pretty girl?

193
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:40,795
and Charlie "Big Red-Ass Baboon
On His Head" Petrella.

194
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:44,117
Catch you later.

195
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:46,515
The Don'll see you now, Mr Gorgoni.

196
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:55,231
- Pop, this is Sal Gorgoni.
- Don Cortino.

197
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:57,874
It is a honour to be in the presence
of such a great man.

198
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:01,470
Your flattery brings a redness
to my hair.

199
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:04,831
Cigar?

200
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:07,155
Very fresh.

201
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:09,999
Uh, thank you, no.

202
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:12,953
Please, sit down.

203
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:15,799
Now, what is so urgent
that you've come to see Don Corduroy...

204
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:19,993
on the third anniversary
of my stepson's liposuction?

205
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:24,238
It is a known fact
that you have the judges in your pocket.

206
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:27,397
The politicians, they dance like--

207
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:30,398
Iike puppets for you.

208
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:31,748
You control the courts.

209
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:35,919
If you agree
to share your influence...

210
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:38,076
I will make you a partner
in my new business.

211
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:41,670
Suck my big ltalian sausage,
you magootza.

212
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:44,109
You make us partner?

213
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:46,276
You'll have to excuse my son.

214
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:50,910
Now, what sort of business
are we talking about?

215
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:53,713
I can make us bigger
than the Almighty Himself.

216
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:59,153
Shut your slimy guinea pazatz!
Nobody's bigger than Sinatra!

217
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:03,512
Joey's a good boy,
but there's always been something
about his personality that, uh--

218
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:05,949
How shall I put it?
He's fuckin' nuts.

219
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:10,517
This was brought in at great expense
from our friends in America Del Sur.

220
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:17,676
Ah! Nondairy creamer.
Good investment.

221
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:20,792
Drugs, Don Cortino.

222
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:25,869
I thank you for your offer, Mr Gorgoni,
but, well, answer me this:

223
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,434
Where is the future of this business?

224
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:31,711
Drugs don't taste good.
You can't put them on cereal.

225
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:33,956
Why would anyone want to invest
in something like that?

226
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:39,235
I hope you don't live
to regret this decision, Don Cortino.

227
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:43,672
Now, if we're finished, I'd like to get
back to my stepdaughter's coronation.

228
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:03,356
Godfather.

229
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:07,189
- Congratulations.
- Oh.

230
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:09,834
Hey, Pop.

231
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:13,919
Hey. I missed you, son.

232
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:17,919
- I missed you too, Pop.
- How was the war? Did you have fun?

233
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:20,395
I want you to meet Diane.

234
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:24,189
- Hi.
- Oh.

235
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:26,356
Tastes like chicken.

236
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:29,870
- Tony!
- Hey!

237
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,560
My big brother got married, huh?
Who is she?

238
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:35,513
Ah, some ltalian girl.
Who's this?

239
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:38,279
Oh, this is Diane.
We went to Vassar together.

240
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:41,312
Hi, Joey.
Anthony's told me so much about you.

241
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:43,874
Psychopath, right?

242
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,877
- Yeah.
- Hey!

243
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:52,196
- Oh, he seems so nice, honey.
- Get back here.
I'll shoot you in the face!

244
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:54,231
Easy, Joey.
Easy. Easy. Easy.

245
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:57,238
Guido.
Say hello to Guido.

246
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:59,430
Hey, scunge,
say hello to my present.

247
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:02,996
- How ya doin'?
- That's somethin', huh?

248
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:07,637
Don Cortino,
Don Marzoni from Las Vegas.

249
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:11,833
Don Cortino. You honour me
by inviting me to your home.

250
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:14,997
I've heard great things about
what you're doing in Las Vegas.

251
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:18,715
You know, you look familiar.

252
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:22,310
Uh, this is a friend of mine,
Pepper Giannini.

253
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:25,477
Mmm. Giannini.
Any Sicilian in you?

254
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:28,592
Not since last night.

255
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:42,478
Marriage.
The bond that binds us together.

256
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:47,515
Myself, I've been married to
the same wonderful woman for 42 years.

257
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:52,509
Of course, sex stopped for us
about a week after the wedding...

258
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:54,278
as it should.

259
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:59,633
I love my Rosa as much today as I did
the first time I forced myself on her.

260
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:02,911
But, uh, how 'bout this one here?

261
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:05,474
Breasts like cabbages.

262
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:09,878
And how about that ass?
You could play canasta on it.

263
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,560
So, Joey...

264
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:16,958
remember this old Sicilian proverb:

265
00:28:17,080 --> 00:28:19,674
"Man is like a piece of cheese."

266
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:27,555
Hear, hear!

267
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,991
- Piece of cheese?
- Piece of cheese.

268
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:20,480
Say hello to my little friend.

269
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:31,798
- What the hell's that?
- That's the jitterbug, guys.
Come on. Jitterbug.

270
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:34,150
Keep up, keep up.

271
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:40,675
Wow!

272
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:53,674
What's he doin' now?

273
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:24,750
No!

274
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:23,354
After the attack on Pop, Joey was on
a rampage. He was ready to go to war.

275
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:27,792
So we brought in some strong-arm goons
from out of town.

276
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:35,110
Pop was in and out of consciousness...

277
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:38,073
and when he was awake
he seemed to have lost his will to live.

278
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:41,749
No doctors? No nurses? There's--
There's no one here to help him.

279
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:45,350
- Diane, he belongs to an HMO.
- Oh.

280
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:53,318
- Is he okay?
- Pop. My God. Pop!

281
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:57,475
I had a dog dream.

282
00:31:57,600 --> 00:32:00,910
Anthony, I always knew
I could count on you.

283
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:04,237
Well, we've been here every day.

284
00:32:04,360 --> 00:32:06,954
Really? So have l.

285
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:08,832
Come close.

286
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:11,679
Uh, Diane, could you excuse us
for a minute?

287
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:15,076
Oh, sure. If you need me,
I'll be up on the bidet.

288
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:19,956
- How bad is it? The truth.
- You're gonna be okay.

289
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:22,833
- You lost a lot of blood,
but we found most of it.
- Yeah.

290
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:26,755
This just arrived.

291
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:34,398
Oh, a carp. How thoughtful.
Fish sticks for everybody.

292
00:32:34,520 --> 00:32:38,149
No, Pop, it's a message.
"Oyster Jimmy sleeps with the fishes."

293
00:32:40,560 --> 00:32:44,758
Well, I hope he's using protection.
Good-looking fella like that could have
any woman he wanted.

294
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:47,155
Present company included.

295
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:56,355
Pop, somebody's out to get us
and we don't know who.

296
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:58,596
Can you think of anybody, Pop?
Anybody?

297
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:02,838
Well, there is a man.
He has only one thumb.

298
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:06,191
It matches this.

299
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:10,757
We used to just steal things,
kill and dismember people.

300
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:15,192
Now it's all drugs.
Oh, where is the honour?

301
00:33:15,320 --> 00:33:17,470
Why go on?

302
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:21,752
I brought somebody
to cheer you up, Pop.

303
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:25,077
Mama?

304
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:27,475
Mama.

305
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:31,309
Look what they did to my boy.

306
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:35,752
Oh, my sweet Vincenzo.

307
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:38,997
I kept your ring for you, Mama.
Here.

308
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:43,995
Let me.

309
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:50,916
It's stuck.
I can't get it off.

310
00:33:57,880 --> 00:34:01,395
- You. Whose kid are you? Huh?
- Here you go, Paulie.

311
00:34:01,520 --> 00:34:03,875
Gino, don't eat so fast.
God'll give you a tumour.

312
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:07,709
Hey, Ma, lay off the kid.
Slow down. You gotta digest.

313
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:11,389
Gorgoni wouldn't try to kill Pop
just 'cause he insulted him.
There's gotta be more to it than that.

314
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:13,875
It had to be Gorgoni.
I say we whack him.

315
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,594
- Don't talk business at the table.
- This shirt is stranglin' me.

316
00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:19,518
- I told you I'd take it back.
- It makes me nuts, the way you shop.

317
00:34:19,640 --> 00:34:22,791
Ooh! ltalian food.

318
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:27,756
What, you think Gorgoni
wants to take over the family? Come on!

319
00:34:27,880 --> 00:34:31,077
- He ain't got the cogliones for that.
- Maybe somebody bigger
ordered the hit, Joey.

320
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:34,715
I told you, not at the table.
You wanna bring a pox?

321
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:38,230
Gorgoni will not stop until Pop is dead.
We gotta have a war.

322
00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:40,316
Kill every one of those
rat-lickin' basserinos.

323
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:46,595
Tie his steaming intestines to a runaway
horse and yank 'em out his ass!

324
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:49,280
- Who wants tea?
- Don't reach.

325
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:52,710
- Hey!
- Don't say "Hey!" to your grandma.
Show some respect.

326
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:56,469
I'm gonna get some tea.
Sure nobody want none?

327
00:34:56,600 --> 00:35:00,832
I tell ya how I'm gonna settle our
differences. I'm gonna shoot the guy
right in the lombardos.

328
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:03,155
Goddam it, I said
not in front of the kids.

329
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:06,875
Just once I'd like to see ya buy
somethin' without havin' to exchange it.

330
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,230
Twenty-four years I'm married.

331
00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:11,920
I coulda shot her and been out on parole
14 years.

332
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:14,110
I'll do it. I'll kill Gorgoni.

333
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:19,470
You? College boy?

334
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:21,556
It's just business.

335
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:26,879
We'll set up a meeting someplace public,
like a roller rink or a boutique.

336
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,833
I'll kill Gorgoni myself.

337
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:36,549
- Diane.
- Cut off her feet and make soup.

338
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:41,234
Diane.

339
00:35:41,360 --> 00:35:45,433
Anthony, do you remember when we were
in college, before you were drafted?

340
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:48,916
We said that we were gonna dedicate
our lives to, to ending war...

341
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:51,508
to bringing peace to the world.

342
00:35:51,640 --> 00:35:54,712
- What happened to that?
- World peace?

343
00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:57,149
Don't be so naive, Diane.

344
00:35:57,280 --> 00:36:01,353
Besides, I can't turn my back on Pop
and Joey. They're like family to me.

345
00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:04,597
Anthony, they're criminals.
They're murderers.

346
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:07,314
Criminals are people too, Diane.

347
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:10,955
If you prick a murderer, does he not
leave a blood trail all the way back
to his Rockingham estate?

348
00:36:13,080 --> 00:36:16,709
This is that whole Sicilian thing,
isn't it?

349
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:18,717
I'll never belong, Anthony.

350
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:22,719
I'm always just gonna be that Protestant
chick who never killed anyone.

351
00:36:25,720 --> 00:36:28,439
All right,
let's go over it again.

352
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:32,189
Now, you kill him after the main course.
Salad's too soon.

353
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:37,553
And then somethin' light for dessert.
Maybe a sorbet or some kiwi.

354
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:40,240
Frankie'll stash the pistol
in the bathroom for ya.

355
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:43,477
He'll put the gun in the stall
behind the flush tank.

356
00:36:43,600 --> 00:36:46,478
Hey, don't worry, Anthony.
You'll do okay.

357
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:50,554
Anthony. Benvenuto.

358
00:36:50,680 --> 00:36:53,752
- He's gonna frisk you.
- Turn your head.

359
00:36:55,120 --> 00:36:57,156
Cough.

360
00:36:57,280 --> 00:36:59,350
He's clean.

361
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:01,835
- And April fresh.
- Sit.

362
00:37:06,040 --> 00:37:08,713
I'm gonna speak ltalian to Anthony.

363
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:40,354
"Lyle Menendez"?
Come on.

364
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:52,672
Come on!

365
00:38:14,600 --> 00:38:16,158
EI Nino.

366
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:32,353
Okay.

367
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:34,755
Oh!

368
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:42,232
Lou Ferrigno?

369
00:39:13,080 --> 00:39:15,514
So, Anthony...

370
00:39:17,320 --> 00:39:19,595
Can we do business?

371
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:24,075
Anthony?

372
00:39:27,560 --> 00:39:29,835
I can hear the ocean.

373
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:48,638
My life had come to this.

374
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:51,035
The little crippled kid
they used to call "Tiny Anthony"...

375
00:39:51,160 --> 00:39:53,594
who had sold flowers
on the street corner...

376
00:39:53,720 --> 00:39:56,598
had grown up to be a killer.

377
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:04,672
When he was my age,
things were different for Pop.

378
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:07,712
By the time of the Great Depression,
my father, Vincenzo Cortino...

379
00:40:07,840 --> 00:40:12,675
was a law-abiding citizen
struggling through the ranks
of the Manhattan olive oil business.

380
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:16,190
Vincenzo Cortino!
Hey, Vincenzo.

381
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:18,959
- Hey, Clamato, how are you?
- Look at you. You work too hard.

382
00:40:19,080 --> 00:40:21,116
Come to the duck fights
with me tonight.

383
00:40:21,240 --> 00:40:25,472
- The kid is undefeated.
- Eh, no, Dominick, thank you.

384
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:29,354
I have a family. I'm married.
I'm not supposed to enjoy myself.

385
00:40:29,480 --> 00:40:32,517
Besides, where'd you get enough money
to buy your own duck, hmm?

386
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:34,710
When are you gonna wise up, Vincenzo?

387
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:37,115
Someday I'm gonna own
an entire goose...

388
00:40:37,240 --> 00:40:40,118
and you'll still have
the stink of olives on you.

389
00:40:42,120 --> 00:40:45,271
- Who is he?
- Don Narducci, the Black Hand.

390
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:48,119
For a price,
he protects the people.

391
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:52,279
Stay away from him, or your life won't
be worth the paper it's printed on.

392
00:41:04,760 --> 00:41:07,035
Yeah.

393
00:41:12,280 --> 00:41:15,829
- That's a good week's work, Vincenzo.
- Papa! Papa!

394
00:41:19,080 --> 00:41:23,232
Papa, Papa, good news!
I sold the other daisy to Signor Biggio.

395
00:41:23,360 --> 00:41:27,035
Ah, Tiny Anthony.
Come. Come.

396
00:41:27,160 --> 00:41:29,469
Ah, you are such a good boy.
You know that?

397
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:32,956
- It's Joey's birthday, Papa.
- Yes, yes, I know.

398
00:41:33,080 --> 00:41:35,640
We will try to find him something nice
on the way home.

399
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:39,912
Well, I guess
you'll be needing your pay.

400
00:41:44,120 --> 00:41:47,271
I give you the big half.

401
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:49,630
Grazie, Mr Rizzo. Grazie.

402
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:53,116
- You are too good to me, huh?
- It's nothing.

403
00:41:53,240 --> 00:41:57,552
- Come. Let's go home.
- You do well. Right, Tiny Anthony?

404
00:41:57,680 --> 00:41:59,830
- I'll see you tomorrow, Signor Rizzo.
- Si.

405
00:41:59,960 --> 00:42:02,190
Goodbye, Mr Rizzo.

406
00:42:03,600 --> 00:42:05,716
God bless us, every one!

407
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:11,669
Mama, we're home!

408
00:42:13,840 --> 00:42:15,273
- Papa.
- Joey.

409
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:19,029
- I sold another flower, Mama.
- That's wonderful.

410
00:42:19,160 --> 00:42:23,233
Come. Sit. Dinner is ready.
Sit, sit. I've been cooking all day.

411
00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:32,879
I had to sell the hook.

412
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:35,355
Ah.

413
00:42:35,480 --> 00:42:40,395
I saw a man today, Rosa,
who sucks his own people dry.

414
00:42:40,520 --> 00:42:43,717
Mmm. Like in those movies
you made me watch.

415
00:42:43,840 --> 00:42:47,515
- No. I mean, in a bad way.
- Oh.

416
00:42:47,640 --> 00:42:49,710
What did you bring me
for my birthday, Papa?

417
00:42:49,840 --> 00:42:52,400
What did I bring you?
This.

418
00:42:52,520 --> 00:42:55,557
Happy birthday, Joey.

419
00:42:55,680 --> 00:42:59,070
- Mmm, boot! It smells delicious, Rosa.
- Mmm.

420
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:01,156
- Who wants an end cut?
- Can I have the tongue?

421
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:04,477
Open your present, Joey.

422
00:43:08,840 --> 00:43:11,308
- Pop, it's a rat.
- No.

423
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:14,955
- It's a puppy.
- But it looks like a rat.

424
00:43:15,080 --> 00:43:17,799
Don't argue with your father.
God'll pluck your eyes out.

425
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:20,195
It's a puppy.

426
00:43:22,520 --> 00:43:27,355
- Must have cost you a fortune.
- Yes. But look how happy the boy is.

427
00:43:37,080 --> 00:43:41,870
Someday, will I be able to run and play
like all the other children?

428
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,833
Yes, my son. Yes.

429
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:47,793
And I promise you,
there will come a day...

430
00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:51,071
where your legs will be as strong
as any ox...

431
00:43:51,200 --> 00:43:54,397
and this--
this battered old crutch...

432
00:43:54,520 --> 00:43:56,795
will be nothing but a memory.

433
00:44:01,360 --> 00:44:04,477
So, the Cortino's are celebrating.

434
00:44:08,080 --> 00:44:10,878
I want my cut of the money
you've been making, Cortino.

435
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:14,390
Please, Don Narducci.
We have nothing.

436
00:44:14,520 --> 00:44:16,397
- Papa! Papa!
- What is it, Joey?

437
00:44:16,520 --> 00:44:19,637
We have the money in the green can we've
been saving for Anthony's operation.

438
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:22,877
I'm not a greedy man.
I just want to wet my beak.

439
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:24,877
- Please, no!
- Rosa.

440
00:44:27,200 --> 00:44:28,872
Next time you'd better have more...

441
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:32,390
or I'll take something
truly precious from you.

442
00:44:38,760 --> 00:44:41,558
God bless us, every one!

443
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:45,833
Danke schoen
Darlin', danke schoen

444
00:44:45,960 --> 00:44:48,554
After I whacked Gorgoni,
I had to disappear.

445
00:44:48,680 --> 00:44:52,468
When a guy on the run wants to hide,
there's no place like Las Vegas.

446
00:44:52,600 --> 00:44:55,478
It's a city with no memory,
a town full of strangers.

447
00:44:55,600 --> 00:44:59,593
I recall Central Park in fall

448
00:44:59,720 --> 00:45:04,111
How you tore your dress
What a mess

449
00:45:04,240 --> 00:45:07,755
They say you can't hit a moving target,
so I kept moving.

450
00:45:07,880 --> 00:45:10,952
Danke schoen
Darlin', danke schoen

451
00:45:11,080 --> 00:45:14,117
Right now, watch,
ladies and gentlemen...

452
00:45:14,240 --> 00:45:19,792
as I transform my lovely assistant
Louise into a Bengal tiger.

453
00:45:22,320 --> 00:45:26,791
Pop never groomed me for a life
like this. He had other plans.

454
00:45:26,920 --> 00:45:30,276
I was supposed to be Senator Cortino
or Governor Cortino.

455
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:32,595
Louise! Tiger!

456
00:45:35,160 --> 00:45:38,914
Louise!
What a pair of legs on her, huh?

457
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:45,435
After a while the long hours, the
pressure to perform, the catty reviews--

458
00:45:45,560 --> 00:45:47,915
it started to wear me down.

459
00:45:48,040 --> 00:45:50,918
Then one day out of the blue,
I get a message from Don Marzoni.

460
00:45:51,040 --> 00:45:54,112
The memory stays for always

461
00:45:54,240 --> 00:45:57,277
- My heart says
- This guy owns Vegas.

462
00:45:57,400 --> 00:46:02,030
Danke schoen
Oh, darlin', danke schoen

463
00:46:02,160 --> 00:46:05,118
I don't know if I could run your casino
even if I wanted to.

464
00:46:05,240 --> 00:46:08,676
You might think of this job
as kind of an insurance policy.

465
00:46:08,800 --> 00:46:12,759
I know that, but I killed a guy.
I mean, I'm on the lam.
Nobody's gonna give me a casino licence.

466
00:46:12,880 --> 00:46:14,836
You don't have to have a licence
to work a casino.

467
00:46:14,960 --> 00:46:17,633
You just apply to the gaming commission.

468
00:46:17,760 --> 00:46:21,594
This commission's the same guys
that run Major League Baseball.
Now, think about it.

469
00:46:21,720 --> 00:46:26,430
You think they're gonna turn you down
just for killing a guy? Nah.

470
00:46:27,960 --> 00:46:30,315
Who could resist?

471
00:46:30,440 --> 00:46:33,238
- Anywhere else in the country,
I'd be just another murderer.
- Place your bets! Place your bets!

472
00:46:33,360 --> 00:46:35,316
- The best things in life are free
- New shooter comin' in!

473
00:46:35,440 --> 00:46:37,908
- But here I was a murderer
who ran a casino.
- Big time! Let's go! Big time!

474
00:46:38,040 --> 00:46:41,953
- Big time!
- Suddenly I fit right in.
- New shooter!

475
00:46:42,080 --> 00:46:44,719
Craps! Loser!

476
00:46:48,480 --> 00:46:52,109
Marzoni brought out my brother Joey
to handle security, and we went to work.

477
00:46:52,240 --> 00:46:54,151
Oh, look who's here.
It's Joey.

478
00:46:54,280 --> 00:46:57,511
- Money don't get everything, it's true
- Oh, my God!

479
00:46:57,640 --> 00:46:59,915
- But what it don't get I can't use
- I'm sorry. You lose.

480
00:47:00,040 --> 00:47:02,076
Nope, I'm sorry.
Thank you for playing.

481
00:47:02,200 --> 00:47:04,953
The way I figured it,
the best way to stay alive
was to make money for the family.

482
00:47:05,080 --> 00:47:06,957
We love it.
Thank you for playing.

483
00:47:07,080 --> 00:47:12,837
So I made money, enough to make
a Wall Street investment banker drool.

484
00:47:12,960 --> 00:47:16,270
- Place your bets. Place your bets.
- All I thought about was the casino.

485
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:19,836
- Fifty-two pick-up.
- No distractions, no time for myself.

486
00:47:19,960 --> 00:47:24,476
- Until...
- Yeah! Come on, baby! Yeah!

487
00:47:24,600 --> 00:47:27,558
Yeah! All right, baby! Yeah!

488
00:47:31,440 --> 00:47:35,672
Sittin' here
Eatin' my heart out, waitin'

489
00:47:35,800 --> 00:47:37,791
Waitin' for some lover to call

490
00:47:37,920 --> 00:47:42,789
- Lookin' for some hot stuff, baby
this evenin'
- Hot stuff, baby

491
00:47:42,920 --> 00:47:46,196
- I need some hot stuff, baby, tonight
- Hot stuff, baby

492
00:47:46,320 --> 00:47:50,199
- I need some hot stuff, baby
this evenin'
- Hot stuff

493
00:47:50,320 --> 00:47:52,390
Got to have some hot stuff

494
00:47:52,520 --> 00:47:54,829
Got to have your love tonight

495
00:47:54,960 --> 00:47:57,633
- Ohh! Oooh!
- Yeah!

496
00:47:57,760 --> 00:48:01,833
- I need hot stuff
- Yeah! Yes!

497
00:48:01,960 --> 00:48:04,394
Hot stuff

498
00:48:04,520 --> 00:48:08,911
She had everything a man could want--

499
00:48:09,040 --> 00:48:12,316
beauty, brains...

500
00:48:12,440 --> 00:48:14,158
and class.

501
00:48:14,280 --> 00:48:16,748
Yeah, yeah! Yeah!

502
00:48:25,080 --> 00:48:28,550
- Lookin' for a lover
who needs another
- Come here, baby!

503
00:48:28,680 --> 00:48:32,229
Don't want another night on my own

504
00:48:32,360 --> 00:48:36,399
What a dismount.
I fell in love right there.

505
00:48:36,520 --> 00:48:38,556
Wanna bring a wild man back home

506
00:48:38,680 --> 00:48:41,513
- Where'd you learn to dance like that?
- Juilliard.

507
00:48:41,640 --> 00:48:45,997
I wanted to be a research chemist,
but my legs were too long.

508
00:48:46,120 --> 00:48:48,918
You know, there's something
very familiar about you.

509
00:48:49,040 --> 00:48:51,918
We met at your father's
attempted murder.

510
00:48:52,040 --> 00:48:54,349
Oh, that's right.
You're Pepper Giannini, right?

511
00:48:54,480 --> 00:48:57,358
- You were with Don Marzoni.
- He's such a sweetheart.

512
00:48:57,480 --> 00:48:59,789
He helped me out once
when I was down on my luck.

513
00:48:59,920 --> 00:49:03,310
- Financial trouble?
- No. Mai Luck, the Chinese ambassador.

514
00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:06,034
Oh, hi!

515
00:49:08,920 --> 00:49:13,630
So, the Peppermill.
Marzoni named it after you, huh?

516
00:49:13,760 --> 00:49:16,911
Sure did.
I'm the apple of his eye.

517
00:49:18,360 --> 00:49:20,476
I'll bet you're
rotten to the core.

518
00:49:20,600 --> 00:49:23,717
Yeah. And I'm delicious.

519
00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:41,153
Diane was becoming
a distant memory--

520
00:49:46,080 --> 00:49:48,116
very distant.

521
00:49:52,920 --> 00:49:55,036
I had a feeling
she was a wildcat...

522
00:49:57,080 --> 00:49:59,719
but I knew I was just the man
who could tame her.

523
00:50:26,680 --> 00:50:29,877
Ow!

524
00:50:40,240 --> 00:50:43,755
Anthony? Anthony?

525
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:51,877
Huh?

526
00:50:52,960 --> 00:50:54,916
Oh!

527
00:50:59,760 --> 00:51:01,671
Wow! Oh!

528
00:51:03,480 --> 00:51:06,756
Oh, yes! Anthony!

529
00:51:11,320 --> 00:51:14,153
Yes! Yes! Yes!

530
00:51:14,280 --> 00:51:16,510
Oh, Anthony!

531
00:51:16,640 --> 00:51:19,074
Wheee!

532
00:51:21,160 --> 00:51:23,913
Wow. You got game.

533
00:51:25,920 --> 00:51:29,151
All bets are down.
The lady's comin' out.

534
00:51:30,520 --> 00:51:32,875
- Yea!
- This lady's a winner.

535
00:51:35,400 --> 00:51:38,756
Pepper started taking up
a lot of my time...

536
00:51:38,880 --> 00:51:41,599
but I tried to stay
focused on the casino.

537
00:51:41,720 --> 00:51:45,110
Box cars. Come on. Yea!

538
00:51:47,320 --> 00:51:49,197
Joey wasn't much help.

539
00:51:55,800 --> 00:51:57,950
- You're winnin' my money?
- Yeah!

540
00:51:59,360 --> 00:52:01,237
Looking back,
I was so blinded by love...

541
00:52:01,360 --> 00:52:04,432
I didn't see the big problem
right in front of me.

542
00:52:15,120 --> 00:52:19,511
Looking for love

543
00:52:19,640 --> 00:52:22,598
If it was white and if it was powder,
Joey was into it.

544
00:52:24,760 --> 00:52:27,513
It was my job to keep
an eye on the gamblers...

545
00:52:29,240 --> 00:52:31,231
but my eyes were
only on Pepper.

546
00:52:31,360 --> 00:52:34,716
- Fourteen, sixteen, bust.
- When I stopped paying attention
so did everyone else...

547
00:52:34,840 --> 00:52:39,356
- House pays.
- and the suckers
started beating the house.

548
00:52:39,480 --> 00:52:42,677
Then the cheaters got wind
and started flocking to us.

549
00:52:42,800 --> 00:52:47,954
They cruise from casino to casino
looking for weak dealers
the way lions look for weak antelope.

550
00:52:51,240 --> 00:52:53,117
Queen.

551
00:52:54,440 --> 00:52:56,510
I could see the dealer
wasn't in on it...

552
00:52:56,640 --> 00:52:59,632
but he was lifting his
hole card way too high.

553
00:52:59,760 --> 00:53:02,149
Yeah.

554
00:53:02,280 --> 00:53:05,511
We had a surefire way
of handling things like that.

555
00:53:07,320 --> 00:53:11,711
Now here's this guy reading
the hole card and signalling his buddy.

556
00:53:11,840 --> 00:53:14,229
- Bet the farm!
- Let me tell you now

557
00:53:14,360 --> 00:53:16,920
I've never felt
like this before

558
00:53:17,040 --> 00:53:20,157
Something's got a hold on me
that won't let go

559
00:53:20,280 --> 00:53:23,352
Believe I'd die if I only could

560
00:53:23,480 --> 00:53:25,835
I feel so strange
but it sure is good

561
00:53:25,960 --> 00:53:27,757
- I said oh
- Oh

562
00:53:27,880 --> 00:53:29,836
- Oh
- Oh
- Oh

563
00:53:29,960 --> 00:53:31,871
- Oh
- Oh
- Oh

564
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:35,629
Hey, hey, hey, yeah
Oh, it must be love

565
00:53:35,760 --> 00:53:38,354
- You know it must be love
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, now

566
00:53:38,480 --> 00:53:41,677
My heart feels heavy
My feet feel light

567
00:53:42,840 --> 00:53:44,558
And I feel all right

568
00:53:44,680 --> 00:53:47,592
- I never felt like this before
- Lord!

569
00:53:47,720 --> 00:53:50,757
Something's got a hold on me
that won't let go

570
00:53:55,880 --> 00:53:59,555
- Mommy!
- Oh! Oh!
- I never thought it would be this way

571
00:54:01,800 --> 00:54:04,519
- Joey was always a hothead,
but I could rely on him.
- Who?

572
00:54:04,640 --> 00:54:07,473
- No, no, no!
- Oh
- Oh
- Oh

573
00:54:07,600 --> 00:54:11,957
- Now with the drugs,
he was out of control,
and the place was falling apart.
- Get out of the way.

574
00:54:12,080 --> 00:54:15,595
Then the take dropped off,
and that's the worst thing
that can happen at a casino.

575
00:54:17,600 --> 00:54:20,478
I did what I could
to turn things around--

576
00:54:20,600 --> 00:54:24,149
we recycled the food,
fired the dishwashers...

577
00:54:24,280 --> 00:54:28,193
started a happy hour for seniors
and the mentally ill.

578
00:54:28,320 --> 00:54:31,471
We even watered down
the drinks...

579
00:54:31,600 --> 00:54:34,876
but that meant
we had to skimp in other places.

580
00:54:36,920 --> 00:54:39,229
Happy birthday to you

581
00:54:39,360 --> 00:54:42,955
- Then things really took a turn
when Pop came to visit.
- Happy birthday to you

582
00:54:43,080 --> 00:54:47,631
Happy birthday, Don Cortino

583
00:54:47,760 --> 00:54:51,548
Happy birthday to you

584
00:54:51,680 --> 00:54:55,195
- Congratulations!
- Happy birthday!

585
00:54:55,320 --> 00:54:59,598
Ah, the cake.
Beautiful, Bonifacio. Beautiful.

586
00:54:59,720 --> 00:55:02,393
I want to thank you all
for coming today.

587
00:55:02,520 --> 00:55:06,798
I know that, uh, many of you
have put off important murders
and drug deals to be here.

588
00:55:06,920 --> 00:55:11,232
I'm especially pleased
to have representatives
from the five families with us--

589
00:55:11,360 --> 00:55:13,669
the Badalotos, the Romanis...

590
00:55:13,800 --> 00:55:16,519
the Marzonis,
the Jeffersons--

591
00:55:16,640 --> 00:55:20,633
who moved on up from the East Side
to get themselves a piece of the pie.

592
00:55:20,760 --> 00:55:25,595
My friends, a while ago
I was shot 47 times.

593
00:55:25,720 --> 00:55:30,077
And it really got me thinking:
It's time to pass on my power.

594
00:55:30,200 --> 00:55:35,797
And I want you all to know that at the
time of my death, l, Don Cortizone...

595
00:55:35,920 --> 00:55:39,674
will turn over all that I control
to my son, Anthony.

596
00:55:39,800 --> 00:55:41,950
- Congratulations!
- Congratulations!

597
00:55:42,080 --> 00:55:44,230
- Good boy, Anthony.
- Just great!

598
00:55:44,360 --> 00:55:46,590
Anthony.

599
00:55:46,720 --> 00:55:48,597
Joey, you get Wisconsin.

600
00:55:50,360 --> 00:55:52,749
Ah, devil's food.

601
00:55:53,720 --> 00:55:56,678
Enjoy!

602
00:55:56,800 --> 00:55:58,677
Enjoy.

603
00:56:01,480 --> 00:56:04,040
- Pastiori!
- Quick-pick loser!

604
00:56:08,640 --> 00:56:12,349
Wisconsin--
big, fat German women.

605
00:56:12,480 --> 00:56:14,357
It ain't right.

606
00:56:17,120 --> 00:56:20,999
If you ask me,
your being passed over's an insult.

607
00:56:21,120 --> 00:56:25,318
I'm smart.
I can handle anything.

608
00:56:25,440 --> 00:56:29,433
- I been groomin' myself
my whole life to be Don.
- Maybe I can help.

609
00:56:31,840 --> 00:56:33,751
It's none of your business,
all right?

610
00:56:33,880 --> 00:56:36,155
Don't ever try to come
between me and my family.

611
00:56:37,720 --> 00:56:40,188
Ooh. Anger.

612
00:56:40,320 --> 00:56:43,756
Maybe I've been barking
up the wrong Cortino.

613
00:56:58,880 --> 00:57:02,429
That a girl.
Come get the bone.

614
00:57:02,560 --> 00:57:06,189
You wanna go to the park?
All right, now roll over.

615
00:57:06,320 --> 00:57:09,153
There you go. Speak!

616
00:57:11,360 --> 00:57:14,909
- Oh, my God. How could you?
- What are ya talkin' about?

617
00:57:15,040 --> 00:57:18,476
A total stranger I could understand.
You and another woman, maybe.

618
00:57:18,600 --> 00:57:22,275
Me, you and another woman, definitely.
But Joey, my brother!

619
00:57:22,400 --> 00:57:25,153
Tony, i-it's not
what it looks like.

620
00:57:25,280 --> 00:57:27,635
It's the Heimlich.
She swallowed a big chunk of meat.

621
00:57:27,760 --> 00:57:31,230
- You're banging your brains out.
- You're just guessing!

622
00:57:31,360 --> 00:57:33,237
What do you take me for,
some kind of an idiot?

623
00:57:33,360 --> 00:57:37,239
Tony, ti amo.
The air conditioning broke.

624
00:57:37,360 --> 00:57:40,272
We had to cool down.

625
00:57:40,400 --> 00:57:42,789
- How can you deny this?
- You can't prove anything.

626
00:57:45,400 --> 00:57:49,279
- You're a slut.
You will sleep with anybody.
- That's what sluts do.

627
00:57:49,400 --> 00:57:51,516
If I was particular,
I wouldn't be a slut.

628
00:57:51,640 --> 00:57:54,757
Joey, you're the last person
in the world I'd expect this from.

629
00:57:54,880 --> 00:57:57,872
- We're family.
I would never betray you.
- Don't lie to me!

630
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:02,596
- You guys are sleeping together!
- All right, all right!
But we never actually slept!

631
00:58:02,720 --> 00:58:06,429
Oh, my G-- That's my brother!
Don't you ever go near him again!

632
00:58:06,560 --> 00:58:09,472
You don't own me, Anthony.

633
00:58:10,840 --> 00:58:14,719
- That's why we don't have
nice things, Pepper.
- Get out! Get out of my life!

634
00:58:28,640 --> 00:58:30,995
- Tony, i-it's not what it looks like.
- Psychopath, right?

635
00:58:31,120 --> 00:58:33,793
I can't turn my back on Pop and Joey.
They're like family to me.

636
00:58:33,920 --> 00:58:37,310
- This is that whole
Sicilian thing, isn't it?
- I would never betray you.

637
00:58:37,440 --> 00:58:40,477
- I always knew I could count on you.
- They're criminals. They're murderers.

638
00:58:40,600 --> 00:58:43,114
- Criminals are people too, Diane.
- Get out of my life!

639
00:58:43,240 --> 00:58:47,358
I did not have sexual relations
with that woman--

640
00:58:47,480 --> 00:58:51,553
Miss Lewinsky--
but I am wearing her underwear.

641
00:59:02,080 --> 00:59:03,957
It's done.

642
00:59:13,560 --> 00:59:15,551
Chuckie?

643
00:59:19,840 --> 00:59:22,149
Watch this.

644
00:59:31,440 --> 00:59:33,556
Boogey, boogey, boogey!

645
00:59:37,720 --> 00:59:40,518
Boogey, boogey, boogey!

646
00:59:43,320 --> 00:59:46,153
That stinks, Chuckie.

647
00:59:46,280 --> 00:59:48,157
I started this.

648
01:00:00,880 --> 01:00:03,348
Grandpa? Grandpa?

649
01:00:06,760 --> 01:00:08,637
Rolex!

650
01:00:20,480 --> 01:00:22,948
Everybody dies,
but in the Mafia...

651
01:00:23,080 --> 01:00:25,548
people die more often,
and never by accident.

652
01:00:27,800 --> 01:00:30,633
The death of my father sent
shock waves through the underworld.

653
01:00:30,760 --> 01:00:34,435
The family was without a leader.

654
01:00:34,560 --> 01:00:38,678
The news reached me at a private
hospital that catered exclusively
to English patients.

655
01:00:38,800 --> 01:00:41,712
One, two, three--

656
01:00:41,840 --> 01:00:46,072
My explosion, his death--
someone wanted the Cortino empire.

657
01:00:46,200 --> 01:00:48,953
We're here today to lay to rest
the dearly departed soul...

658
01:00:49,080 --> 01:00:52,993
of Don Vincenzo
Armani Windbreaker Cortino.

659
01:00:53,120 --> 01:00:56,829
The Lord is my shepherd.
I shall not want.

660
01:00:56,960 --> 01:01:00,077
He maketh me to lie down
in green pastures.

661
01:01:00,200 --> 01:01:03,272
He leadeth me beside
the still waters.

662
01:01:03,400 --> 01:01:08,474
Yea, though I walk through
the valley of the shadow of death...

663
01:01:08,600 --> 01:01:11,068
I shall fear no evil.

664
01:01:15,840 --> 01:01:19,310
The rod--
Thy rod and Thy staff--

665
01:01:19,440 --> 01:01:23,592
- It's okay, Mama. I'm here now.
- They-- They will comfort me--

666
01:01:23,720 --> 01:01:25,676
I'll preparest a table--
a table--

667
01:01:25,800 --> 01:01:29,236
- I know.
- There's a table--
- I know. I'm glad to see you too.

668
01:01:29,360 --> 01:01:30,998
My table is prepared.

669
01:01:33,480 --> 01:01:36,278
- Everyone had something to gain
with Pop out of the way.
- Surely--

670
01:01:36,400 --> 01:01:38,277
- I couldn't trust anybody.
- Surely and-and-and Laverne.

671
01:01:38,400 --> 01:01:42,393
- Which one of them killed my father?
- There was kindness--

672
01:01:42,520 --> 01:01:45,512
- Don Romani from the Chicago family?
- From the days--
All the days of my life--

673
01:01:45,640 --> 01:01:49,553
- Don Badaloto from the Cleveland mob?
- Uh, and I will dwell in my house.

674
01:01:49,680 --> 01:01:52,433
-Don Quixote?
-And I will dwell in your house-- house.

675
01:01:52,560 --> 01:01:58,112
- Don Cornelius?
- Love, peace and soul.

676
01:01:58,240 --> 01:01:59,832
Dwell in the Lord's house--

677
01:01:59,960 --> 01:02:02,474
But it wasn't until I saw Chuckie,
my brother Joey's kid...

678
01:02:02,600 --> 01:02:05,751
taking a pay-off from the man
with the missing thumb...

679
01:02:05,880 --> 01:02:09,509
that I realized our family's enemy
had been Don Marzoni all along.

680
01:02:09,640 --> 01:02:14,316
- I had been embraced by the very man
whose lifelong vendetta had been
to kill my father.
- Oh, no!

681
01:02:14,440 --> 01:02:17,193
And now, with my own nephew,
he had succeeded.

682
01:02:17,320 --> 01:02:21,996
In the quicksand of organized crime,
the only option is retribution.

683
01:02:22,120 --> 01:02:24,680
My cup runneth--

684
01:02:38,880 --> 01:02:41,269
I wondered how Pop
would have handled all of this.

685
01:02:41,400 --> 01:02:45,075
- Then I thought back to the most
important day of my childhood.
- Daisies, daisies!

686
01:02:45,200 --> 01:02:47,555
Five dozen for a nickel!

687
01:02:49,440 --> 01:02:52,637
Daisies, daisies!
Five dozen for a nickel!

688
01:02:52,760 --> 01:02:55,513
Hi, Tiny Anthony.
How's my favourite florist?

689
01:02:55,640 --> 01:02:58,632
Oh, hi, Jenny.
This is for you.

690
01:02:58,760 --> 01:03:00,637
Thank you.

691
01:03:00,760 --> 01:03:05,914
Ah, the Cortino boy. You know,
your papa never paid me what he owes.

692
01:03:11,520 --> 01:03:14,432
You've done well.
This belongs to me.

693
01:03:16,400 --> 01:03:20,791
Of course, Don Narducci.
And so does this!

694
01:03:22,560 --> 01:03:24,949
- Miracle Gro!
- You okay, boss? You okay?

695
01:03:25,080 --> 01:03:29,278
- Hey, kid!
- Come on. Let's go after him.
- Get him!
- Hey, you! Come here!

696
01:03:44,640 --> 01:03:49,714
Run, florist, run!

697
01:04:01,440 --> 01:04:04,273
Get back here, kid!

698
01:04:07,720 --> 01:04:10,917
Ooh! Pitchfork!
Look out!

699
01:04:17,400 --> 01:04:20,517
Papa! Papa!

700
01:04:20,640 --> 01:04:23,108
Tiny Anthony, my boy!

701
01:04:23,240 --> 01:04:25,356
It's a miracle!

702
01:04:28,880 --> 01:04:30,757
Stay.

703
01:04:32,560 --> 01:04:37,031
You surprise me, Don Narducci.
They say violence is
the hand puppet of the ignorant.

704
01:04:37,160 --> 01:04:41,039
- Don't call me ignorant.
- No? Then answer me this:

705
01:04:41,160 --> 01:04:45,312
Train "A" Ieaves Seattle
at 40 miles per hour.

706
01:04:45,440 --> 01:04:48,671
Train "B" Ieaves Houston
at 50 miles per hour.

707
01:04:48,800 --> 01:04:51,234
Which train
arrives at Sea World first?

708
01:04:51,360 --> 01:04:53,874
- Papa! Papa!
- And carry the six.
- What is it, Joey?

709
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:58,391
This is 1938. There won't be
Sea World for another 30 years.

710
01:04:58,520 --> 01:05:02,354
You tried to trick me.
Now I kill you all.

711
01:05:08,320 --> 01:05:10,709
He's mine!

712
01:05:38,200 --> 01:05:40,270
Don Cortino!

713
01:05:41,360 --> 01:05:43,590
Godfather.

714
01:05:43,720 --> 01:05:45,995
Papa taught me
the virtue of vengeance.

715
01:05:46,120 --> 01:05:49,032
Now was time to take control
of the family business.

716
01:05:49,160 --> 01:05:52,994
But first I had to put my life back
on track, and that meant finding Diane.

717
01:05:53,120 --> 01:05:56,999
And although it seemed an
impossible dream just a few years ago...

718
01:05:57,120 --> 01:06:01,318
the feeling here today fluctuates
between anxious anticipation...

719
01:06:01,440 --> 01:06:05,194
and outright exhilaration
as political and spiritual leaders...

720
01:06:05,320 --> 01:06:09,279
from every country on Earth
have convened at this historic site...

721
01:06:09,400 --> 01:06:11,868
to witness the final signature
on the document...

722
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:16,437
that will secure and guarantee
world peace in perpetuity.

723
01:06:16,560 --> 01:06:19,393
The "Peace For All Time" treaty--
or P-FAT...

724
01:06:19,520 --> 01:06:24,036
as it has been dubbed
by its author and champion,
the President of the United States--

725
01:06:24,160 --> 01:06:28,358
marks the culmination of one
valiant person's heroic crusade...

726
01:06:28,480 --> 01:06:32,155
to end strife,
no matter where it may occur.

727
01:06:32,280 --> 01:06:34,589
The presidential limousine
is arriving.

728
01:06:34,720 --> 01:06:38,918
The president is emerging
and striding triumphantly forward.

729
01:06:39,040 --> 01:06:42,715
One can only imagine the thoughts
that must be racing through her mind...

730
01:06:42,840 --> 01:06:47,277
as the world's attention focuses on
this unprecedented achievement.

731
01:06:47,400 --> 01:06:50,472
Mrs President.

732
01:06:50,600 --> 01:06:53,512
With the addition
of my signature today...

733
01:06:53,640 --> 01:06:55,949
P-FAT becomes a reality.

734
01:06:57,000 --> 01:06:59,230
It is my most fervent hope
that this be...

735
01:06:59,360 --> 01:07:02,830
the moment when
all mankind comes together--

736
01:07:02,960 --> 01:07:07,590
when at last the world's population
can rise as one, and say--

737
01:07:09,200 --> 01:07:12,510
Anthony?

738
01:07:12,640 --> 01:07:14,631
- Oh, my God!
- Step back.

739
01:07:14,760 --> 01:07:17,115
- Stand closely. Take the left.
- I got it.

740
01:07:17,240 --> 01:07:21,791
- Anthony.
- It's good to see you, Diane.

741
01:07:23,480 --> 01:07:28,793
- What happened to your face?
- Car exploded.

742
01:07:28,920 --> 01:07:34,756
- What are you doing here, Anthony?
- I've taken over the family business.
I need you.

743
01:07:34,880 --> 01:07:38,077
I care about you.
I came here because I want you
to marry me and come home with me.

744
01:07:38,200 --> 01:07:40,350
Madam President, the treaty.

745
01:07:40,480 --> 01:07:42,471
Madam President?

746
01:07:42,600 --> 01:07:44,955
But what about P-FAT, Anthony?

747
01:07:45,080 --> 01:07:49,232
I'm so near to fulfilling the dream
that-- that we once shared.

748
01:07:55,080 --> 01:07:57,150
There's someone
I want you to meet.

749
01:07:57,280 --> 01:07:59,271
This is my very good friend,
President Steen.

750
01:07:59,400 --> 01:08:02,836
- Would you like to say hi to her?
- Hi, President Steen.

751
01:08:02,960 --> 01:08:06,953
Hello. You're a daddy.

752
01:08:07,080 --> 01:08:09,196
I'm a daddy.

753
01:08:10,360 --> 01:08:15,275
- So, what's your name?
- Diane.

754
01:08:15,400 --> 01:08:19,029
- Like me!
- I named him after his mother.

755
01:08:24,640 --> 01:08:26,949
I'm a mother?

756
01:08:27,080 --> 01:08:30,993
- Why didn't you tell me?
- You said you didn't want
to be a part of my life.

757
01:08:31,120 --> 01:08:32,997
Oh!

758
01:08:33,120 --> 01:08:36,635
Anthony, he's the most beautiful thing
I've ever seen!

759
01:08:36,760 --> 01:08:39,035
He looks just like me!

760
01:08:39,920 --> 01:08:43,515
You smell good.

761
01:08:43,640 --> 01:08:46,632
I had cantaloupe for lunch.

762
01:08:46,760 --> 01:08:48,955
- You like football, huh?
- Uh-huh.

763
01:08:49,080 --> 01:08:52,470
Ever since Michael lrvin
laid off the nose candy.

764
01:08:52,600 --> 01:08:55,353
Do you want to play?

765
01:08:55,480 --> 01:08:58,756
- I'd love to.
- Are you my real mommy?

766
01:09:04,200 --> 01:09:06,395
Uh-huh.

767
01:09:07,960 --> 01:09:10,394
Go long, Mommy.

768
01:09:47,720 --> 01:09:49,551
Yeah, I understand, but--

769
01:09:49,760 --> 01:09:52,672
I-l don't know
if I can make it there.

770
01:09:52,800 --> 01:09:54,756
You sure?

771
01:09:54,880 --> 01:09:58,509
You're out of the wedding, Joey.

772
01:09:58,640 --> 01:10:02,110
- It's a local call.
- You gotta answer for Pop.

773
01:10:03,920 --> 01:10:07,310
What the hell you talkin' about?
I had nothin' to do with that.

774
01:10:07,440 --> 01:10:11,592
You fingered him. Just like you
set me up that day in Vegas--

775
01:10:11,720 --> 01:10:13,790
that little sexual fromage-a-trois
you played with Pepper.

776
01:10:13,920 --> 01:10:16,354
You think you can fool
another Cortino?

777
01:10:16,480 --> 01:10:19,438
You bastarducci!

778
01:10:19,560 --> 01:10:22,120
Sit down.

779
01:10:24,800 --> 01:10:27,109
Get him a drink.

780
01:10:27,240 --> 01:10:29,993
Tony, don't do this
to me, please.

781
01:10:30,120 --> 01:10:33,795
You think I'd kill my own brother
just 'cause he tried to kill me?

782
01:10:33,920 --> 01:10:36,480
Today's the day I settle
all family business.

783
01:10:36,600 --> 01:10:39,910
- I'm putting you on a plane to Fargo.
- These are over the wing!

784
01:10:41,720 --> 01:10:44,951
Now, tell me everything
that happened that night.

785
01:10:46,800 --> 01:10:49,234
And don't lie to me,
because it insults my intelligence.

786
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:53,594
Pepper got me
together with Marzoni.

787
01:10:53,720 --> 01:10:58,271
He said if I helped him out,
he'd make it worth my while.

788
01:10:58,400 --> 01:11:01,437
- He said he'd make me
head of the family.
- You know I'd always take care of you.

789
01:11:01,560 --> 01:11:07,192
You're my kid brother! You take care
of me? I'm the oldest, Tony,
and I was stepped over!

790
01:11:07,320 --> 01:11:10,756
- That was Pop's idea.
- Well, it wasn't my idea.
- You're a psychotic lunatic!

791
01:11:10,880 --> 01:11:12,996
And I deserve respect for that!

792
01:11:15,440 --> 01:11:17,715
You broke my heart, Joey.

793
01:11:17,840 --> 01:11:20,400
I don't ever want
to see you again.

794
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:31,877
That's, uh, $3.50.

795
01:12:05,920 --> 01:12:08,912
Dearly beloved, we are gathered here
in the sight of God...

796
01:12:09,040 --> 01:12:13,079
to join this man and this woman
in the state of holy matrimony.

797
01:12:15,160 --> 01:12:17,799
It is the most sacred
of journeys...

798
01:12:17,920 --> 01:12:20,354
one in which
the sanctity of human life...

799
01:12:20,480 --> 01:12:23,153
is cherished and celebrated.

800
01:12:24,400 --> 01:12:26,834
Your love must be sincere.

801
01:12:26,960 --> 01:12:30,873
Detest what is evil,
cling to what is good...

802
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:34,515
rejoice in hope,
be patient under trial...

803
01:12:34,640 --> 01:12:40,033
persevere in prayer,
be generous in offering hospitality.

804
01:12:40,160 --> 01:12:42,515
Clothe yourselves
with heartfelt mercy...

805
01:12:42,640 --> 01:12:46,519
with kindness, with humility,
meekness and patience.

806
01:12:47,680 --> 01:12:52,196
Bear with one another. Forgive whatever
grievances you have against one another.

807
01:12:53,520 --> 01:12:56,671
My dear friends, you have
come together in this church...

808
01:12:56,800 --> 01:12:59,360
so that the Lord may seal
and strengthen your love...

809
01:12:59,480 --> 01:13:03,189
in the presence of this church's
minister and community.

810
01:13:03,320 --> 01:13:07,836
And so in the presence of the Church,
I ask you to state your intentions.

811
01:13:07,960 --> 01:13:11,555
Anthony and Diane, have you come here
freely and without reservation...

812
01:13:11,680 --> 01:13:13,875
to give yourselves
to each other in marriage?

813
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:16,309
- We have.
- We have.

814
01:13:16,440 --> 01:13:21,639
Will you love and honour each other as
man and wife for the rest of your life?

815
01:13:21,760 --> 01:13:24,228
We will.

816
01:13:24,360 --> 01:13:26,794
Let us pray.

817
01:13:46,760 --> 01:13:48,637
Huh?

818
01:14:06,800 --> 01:14:11,351
Anthony and Diane, since it is
your intention to enter into marriage...

819
01:14:11,480 --> 01:14:15,359
join your right hands
and declare your consent.

820
01:14:17,640 --> 01:14:20,837
Diane, do you take Anthony
for your lawful husband...

821
01:14:20,960 --> 01:14:23,269
to have and to hold
from this day forward...

822
01:14:23,400 --> 01:14:26,870
for better, for worse, for richer,
for poorer, in sickness and in health...

823
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:29,036
till death do you part?

824
01:14:29,160 --> 01:14:30,832
I do.

825
01:14:30,960 --> 01:14:34,077
Anthony, do you take Diane to be
your lawfully wedded wife...

826
01:14:34,200 --> 01:14:38,273
to have and to hold from this
day forward, for better, for worse...

827
01:14:38,400 --> 01:14:43,076
for richer, for poorer, in sickness
and in health, till death do you part?

828
01:14:43,200 --> 01:14:45,509
I do.

829
01:14:50,600 --> 01:14:54,388
Ow! Yikes! Hey!

830
01:14:55,880 --> 01:14:58,314
That's my liver, you dick!

831
01:15:22,040 --> 01:15:24,315
Watch me. Watch me.

832
01:15:35,360 --> 01:15:39,069
- What God hath joined together...
- Not personal. Is business.

833
01:15:39,200 --> 01:15:42,272
Iet no man tear asunder.

834
01:15:46,560 --> 01:15:49,074
Mazel Tov!

835
01:16:24,080 --> 01:16:27,516
- That's far enough, guys. Mafia only.
- Oh. Sorry.

836
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:32,958
Lousy, cold-hearted bastard!

837
01:16:33,080 --> 01:16:36,470
You knew you were gonna kill them,
didn't you? Look at the papers!

838
01:16:36,600 --> 01:16:39,831
That's you!
That's my husband!

839
01:16:41,280 --> 01:16:46,035
- Is it true?
- Don't ask me about my business, Diane.

840
01:16:46,160 --> 01:16:51,029
Is it true, Anthony? Did you kill
those men? Did you kill Joey's son?

841
01:16:58,560 --> 01:17:00,357
No.

842
01:17:00,480 --> 01:17:04,758
Oh. Okay. Whoops.

843
01:17:05,960 --> 01:17:08,997
You know what? Think I'm gonna
go get some frozen yogurt.

844
01:17:09,120 --> 01:17:11,918
See you a little bit later.

845
01:17:13,120 --> 01:17:14,917
So, here's the enigma:

846
01:17:15,040 --> 01:17:17,679
Some would argue that
the Mafia's a bad thing...

847
01:17:17,800 --> 01:17:20,519
that it uses its power
to undermine law and order...

848
01:17:20,640 --> 01:17:24,599
- to promote the very lowest forms
of human behaviour.
- Don Cortino.

849
01:17:24,720 --> 01:17:27,871
Of course, that's all true,
but in the end, maybe it's worth it.

850
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:31,834
The way I see it, when the law
fails us, it fails our children.

851
01:17:31,960 --> 01:17:35,077
- Godfather.
- Only the Mafia has the power
to do the one deed...

852
01:17:35,200 --> 01:17:37,077
to benefit all mankind.

853
01:17:45,600 --> 01:17:47,830
We are family

854
01:17:49,360 --> 01:17:52,079
I got all my sisters with me

855
01:17:53,240 --> 01:17:55,231
We are family

856
01:17:57,040 --> 01:17:59,395
Get up, everybody and sing

857
01:18:00,920 --> 01:18:03,753
We are family

858
01:18:04,840 --> 01:18:07,513
I got all my sisters with me

859
01:18:08,600 --> 01:18:10,955
We are family

860
01:18:12,640 --> 01:18:14,790
Get up, everybody and sing

861
01:18:17,640 --> 01:18:21,315
Everyone can see we're together

862
01:18:21,440 --> 01:18:25,115
- As we walk on by
- And

863
01:18:25,240 --> 01:18:28,835
And we fly just like birds
of a feather

864
01:18:28,960 --> 01:18:32,635
- I won't tell no lie
- All

865
01:18:32,760 --> 01:18:36,514
All of the people around us
they say

866
01:18:36,640 --> 01:18:39,473
Can they be that close

867
01:18:39,600 --> 01:18:43,434
- Just let me state for the record
- Ooh, ltalian food!

868
01:18:43,560 --> 01:18:46,996
We're givin' love
in a family dose

869
01:18:47,120 --> 01:18:49,315
We are family

870
01:18:50,760 --> 01:18:53,149
I got all my sisters with me

871
01:18:54,600 --> 01:18:56,875
We are family

872
01:18:58,600 --> 01:19:02,388
Get up, everybody and sing

873
01:19:02,520 --> 01:19:06,115
-We are family
-We're family! I would never betray you.

874
01:19:06,240 --> 01:19:08,595
I got all my sisters with me

875
01:19:09,840 --> 01:19:12,400
We are family

876
01:19:13,680 --> 01:19:15,989
Get up, everybody and sing

877
01:19:16,120 --> 01:19:18,076
Yeah

878
01:19:30,760 --> 01:19:33,320
- Yea!
- Come on, y'all!

879
01:19:36,960 --> 01:19:40,635
We are family

880
01:19:40,760 --> 01:19:43,069
- Get up everybody and sing
- Hey, how ya doin'?

881
01:19:43,200 --> 01:19:46,795
- Ooh, yeah

882
01:19:48,480 --> 01:19:50,471

883
01:19:50,600 --> 01:19:54,309

We are family

886
01:20:02,280 --> 01:20:06,432
- You smell good.
- I had cantaloupe for lunch.

887
01:23:06,680 --> 01:23:08,875
Just great!
