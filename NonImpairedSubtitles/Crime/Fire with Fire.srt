1
00:00:54,388 --> 00:00:56,527
What's he doing in there?

2
00:00:56,690 --> 00:00:58,135
I thought he was right behind us?

3
00:00:58,292 --> 00:01:00,238
He's getting something
for the bar owner.

4
00:01:00,394 --> 00:01:02,271
He's getting
something for the bar owner?

5
00:01:09,536 --> 00:01:10,776
I think I see him.

6
00:01:13,273 --> 00:01:15,219
Whoa!

7
00:01:16,276 --> 00:01:17,914
Mission accomplished.

8
00:01:20,847 --> 00:01:23,384
- Here you go, sir.
- No no no.

9
00:01:24,952 --> 00:01:26,727
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

10
00:01:26,887 --> 00:01:28,730
That's an expensive case of Scotch.

11
00:01:28,889 --> 00:01:31,631
- Merry Christmas, guys.
- Merry Christmas to you.

12
00:01:31,792 --> 00:01:33,863
- Thank you very much.
- Thanks, man, thanks.

13
00:01:34,027 --> 00:01:36,473
So what do you guys say?
Happy hour my place 6:00 a.m.?

14
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:38,803
- Whool
- Let's go!

15
00:01:38,966 --> 00:01:40,274
Yeah. Thanks.

16
00:01:40,434 --> 00:01:42,141
Let's do this.

17
00:01:43,904 --> 00:01:46,145
I'm gonna throw this up front.

18
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:54,923
I'm sorry your night got mined.

19
00:01:55,082 --> 00:01:57,062
Hopefully this makes
you feel a little better.

20
00:02:09,363 --> 00:02:12,173
She was cute!
Look at you.

21
00:02:12,332 --> 00:02:15,006
Jeremy Coleman-
one-man community outreach program.

22
00:02:15,168 --> 00:02:17,079
Don't say it!
Okay, I don't want to hear it.

23
00:02:17,204 --> 00:02:19,844
Let's just try and give this
one more than a couple weeks.

24
00:02:20,007 --> 00:02:22,613
Just because you've been domesticated
doesn't mean I want to be domesticated.

25
00:02:22,776 --> 00:02:24,949
I need you to get domesticated.
We need another couple to hang out with.

26
00:02:25,112 --> 00:02:27,558
Ooh, another exciting night
of Pictionary? No thank you, I'm good.

27
00:02:27,748 --> 00:02:30,024
Pictionary, Charades,
some fuckin' Boggle--

28
00:02:30,183 --> 00:02:32,686
Yourjabbering is delaying
my drinking. Let's get mobile.

29
00:02:32,853 --> 00:02:34,457
I'm right behind you.
Let's do this.

30
00:02:34,621 --> 00:02:36,692
We gotta stop by the store,
get provisions.

31
00:02:36,857 --> 00:02:38,928
Hey, what are you
doing for Christmas?

32
00:02:39,092 --> 00:02:41,003
What do I do every Christmas?
I'm picking up a shift.

33
00:02:41,161 --> 00:02:43,539
We're having dinner with Maria's family.
You're invited.

34
00:02:43,697 --> 00:02:45,199
- She insists.
- Thank you, really,

35
00:02:45,365 --> 00:02:46,639
but I like working the holidays.

36
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:47,870
- Let's go.
- Of course.

37
00:02:51,038 --> 00:02:53,382
Weeest, y'all can
accept it or not

38
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:55,520
Fools thinkin' Dub S
left wit 'Pac

39
00:02:55,676 --> 00:02:58,486
Weeest, still in tha 4s
and the 'lacs--

40
00:03:00,213 --> 00:03:01,886
Hey hey hey.
Grab me some--

41
00:03:02,049 --> 00:03:05,587
Stop! Before you ask for whatever shit
you're about to ask for,

42
00:03:05,786 --> 00:03:08,892
- remember, 15-year-old Scotch.
- That means it's good, Craig.

43
00:03:09,056 --> 00:03:11,696
I understand now, fellows.
Thank you.

44
00:03:11,858 --> 00:03:13,701
- Grab me a double bag of Funyuns.
- Fuck.

45
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:15,271
- Are you kidding me?
- Come on.

46
00:03:15,429 --> 00:03:17,909
If I'm not mistaken, we're about
to drink this upscale booze

47
00:03:18,065 --> 00:03:20,875
in plastic cups in your shitty apartment
at 7:00 in the morning,

48
00:03:21,034 --> 00:03:23,071
so ease up off the sommelier shit

49
00:03:23,236 --> 00:03:26,046
- and grab me some fucking Funyuns!
- You're disgusting.

50
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:29,581
Hey, we'll be across
the street getting gas. All right?

51
00:03:29,743 --> 00:03:31,245
And some black licorice, Jeremy!

52
00:03:31,411 --> 00:03:34,085
I like my licorice
like I like my women.

53
00:03:34,247 --> 00:03:35,920
Don't discriminate, Jeremy!

54
00:03:36,917 --> 00:03:39,523
- Yo, Jeremy! What's up, man?
- Morning, fellas!

55
00:03:39,686 --> 00:03:42,098
You don't have to straighten up for me,
Calvin, that's all right.

56
00:03:42,255 --> 00:03:44,565
You know I'm playing in that
holiday tournament tomorrow night.

57
00:03:44,725 --> 00:03:46,864
- You better show up this time.
- I'll be there, hey, I'll be there.

58
00:03:47,027 --> 00:03:49,405
I promise.
Hey, Pringles 3-pointer-- hit me.

59
00:03:50,397 --> 00:03:52,741
- Whool
- Look at that kid.

60
00:03:52,899 --> 00:03:55,277
And that's why
the college scouts keep calling.

61
00:03:55,435 --> 00:03:57,108
It's looking like a full ride now.

62
00:03:57,270 --> 00:03:58,874
Hell, they might even take me.

63
00:03:59,039 --> 00:04:00,780
Yeah right, Dad.
Keep dreaming.

64
00:04:00,941 --> 00:04:02,943
So you've been out
rescuing cats from trees?

65
00:04:03,110 --> 00:04:05,454
Yeah, something like that.
Hey, when are you gonnajoin up?

66
00:04:05,612 --> 00:04:08,024
Yeah right,
maybe the Second Coming.

67
00:04:08,181 --> 00:04:10,218
How you doing, fellas?

68
00:04:15,322 --> 00:04:17,029
La-di-da.

69
00:04:18,225 --> 00:04:19,795
Help you with something?

70
00:04:25,465 --> 00:04:28,105
Keep your nose
on the floor, you fucker!

71
00:04:28,268 --> 00:04:29,906
Settle down.

72
00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:32,311
- Now!
Okay okay.

73
00:04:40,147 --> 00:04:42,252
Don't you do nothin'.

74
00:04:42,415 --> 00:04:43,985
Okay.

75
00:04:44,151 --> 00:04:46,597
Why don't you come out
from around the counter?

76
00:04:52,926 --> 00:04:55,099
Get on your knees right here!

77
00:04:57,164 --> 00:04:58,837
Get your nose on the fuckin' ground.

78
00:04:58,999 --> 00:05:00,342
Get on your knees!

79
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:01,843
Kneel down.

80
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:11,186
Now my man that came
in here last week,

81
00:05:12,612 --> 00:05:14,853
he told you I wanted your store.

82
00:05:16,183 --> 00:05:17,787
Now you told him that

83
00:05:17,951 --> 00:05:20,022
you weren't gonna give up the lease.

84
00:05:20,187 --> 00:05:22,189
I told him I was sorry

85
00:05:22,355 --> 00:05:24,266
but this is a good location for us.

86
00:05:24,391 --> 00:05:26,871
Yeah, I know it's a good location.

87
00:05:28,929 --> 00:05:31,341
- It's got freeways.
- Yeah.

88
00:05:31,498 --> 00:05:33,500
Easy to move packages in and out.

89
00:05:33,667 --> 00:05:35,112
I know it.

90
00:05:35,268 --> 00:05:37,475
This whole neighborhood

91
00:05:37,637 --> 00:05:39,344
belongs to the Eastside Crips.

92
00:05:39,506 --> 00:05:41,679
Eastside Crips.

93
00:05:41,842 --> 00:05:44,880
Look, I have to pay them
every month.

94
00:05:45,045 --> 00:05:47,651
I'm under their protection.

95
00:05:47,814 --> 00:05:50,021
So it's no disrespect to you,

96
00:05:50,183 --> 00:05:52,891
but that's the reason
you can't do business here.

97
00:05:53,053 --> 00:05:55,055
If you want me to,
I can call them for you.

98
00:05:55,222 --> 00:05:57,202
I mean you can talk
to 'em for yourself.

99
00:05:57,357 --> 00:05:58,961
Look, I'll get my phone.

100
00:05:59,125 --> 00:06:00,399
HQY1 Pllf your chin up!

101
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:01,868
I was just gettin' my phone.

102
00:06:02,028 --> 00:06:04,565
I mean if you want to,
you can talk to 'em.

103
00:06:04,731 --> 00:06:08,201
I'd like that, yeah.
Yeah, get your phone.

104
00:06:09,569 --> 00:06:11,879
Don't fucking tempt me!
I want to!

105
00:06:13,073 --> 00:06:14,882
Here.

106
00:06:17,010 --> 00:06:18,546
Hey, what's up, cuz?

107
00:06:18,712 --> 00:06:21,090
My name is David Hagan.

108
00:06:21,248 --> 00:06:23,888
I don't care much what yours is.

109
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:26,792
Listen, you gonna go up
against me, I'll kill you.

110
00:06:26,987 --> 00:06:30,764
I'll kill you and everyone close to you.

111
00:06:32,325 --> 00:06:33,929
- Jesus!
- Calvin!

112
00:06:34,094 --> 00:06:36,802
- No.
- Yeah yeah!

113
00:06:36,997 --> 00:06:39,273
- Oh Jesus, oh Jesus Christ.
- Shut the fuck up.

114
00:06:39,432 --> 00:06:41,537
- Tell him I shot your son.
What did you kill him for?

115
00:06:41,701 --> 00:06:44,079
Come on, Dennis.
Tell him I shot your son.

116
00:06:44,237 --> 00:06:45,773
- Come on, Dennis.
- Oh my God.

117
00:06:45,939 --> 00:06:48,215
Tell him to prove a point
lshot your son.

118
00:06:48,375 --> 00:06:50,821
It'll mean more if you do it.

119
00:06:52,746 --> 00:06:55,625
- Shit.
- Come on, baby, come on.

120
00:06:55,782 --> 00:06:58,729
- Come on, come on.
- Nah.

121
00:06:58,885 --> 00:07:02,230
- No, Dennis!
- Now we're talking.

122
00:07:05,025 --> 00:07:06,470
Hi, I'm back.

123
00:07:06,626 --> 00:07:08,128
Listen, if I want your territory,

124
00:07:08,295 --> 00:07:10,639
I'll take your territory.

125
00:07:10,797 --> 00:07:13,505
It's been nice talking to you.

126
00:07:15,669 --> 00:07:17,080
What about him?

127
00:07:17,237 --> 00:07:20,150
I don't know, genius.
Figure it out.

128
00:07:28,615 --> 00:07:30,060
Fuck.

129
00:08:14,728 --> 00:08:17,470
Oh God damn it!

130
00:08:18,698 --> 00:08:20,006
- Jeremy!
- Jeremy!

131
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:21,201
Jeremy!

132
00:08:21,368 --> 00:08:22,870
- Oh shit.
- What is it, man?

133
00:08:23,036 --> 00:08:24,709
- Jeremy.
- Call 911.

134
00:08:24,871 --> 00:08:28,148
- Jeremy, are you all right?
- Call 911. They shot Calvin.

135
00:08:28,308 --> 00:08:30,049
- Who?
- They shot Dennis.

136
00:08:30,210 --> 00:08:31,689
Who who who?
Who shot Dennis?

137
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:43,291
Mike? Mike?

138
00:08:43,456 --> 00:08:45,561
You're gonna want to see this.

139
00:08:48,728 --> 00:08:50,537
- What's the charge?
- Murder in the first.

140
00:08:50,697 --> 00:08:51,903
- Who caught the case?
- Paxson.

141
00:08:52,065 --> 00:08:53,840
I know-- there was
no evidence at the scene,

142
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,843
but there was an eyewitness,
and he's solid--

143
00:08:56,002 --> 00:08:57,572
he was like three feet
away from Hagan.

144
00:08:57,737 --> 00:08:59,410
Please tell me
they didn't fuck this up.

145
00:08:59,572 --> 00:09:01,176
It's a slam dunk even for him.

146
00:09:01,341 --> 00:09:03,184
- It's done.
- Tell Paxson I'm taking over the case.

147
00:09:03,343 --> 00:09:05,880
- When are they making the arrest?
- He's already in the box.

148
00:09:36,443 --> 00:09:38,980
David Hagan, line up.
Let's go.

149
00:09:48,455 --> 00:09:49,832
Lieutenant.

150
00:09:56,729 --> 00:09:58,470
How are you doing, Mike?

151
00:09:58,631 --> 00:10:00,269
Great.

152
00:10:02,902 --> 00:10:05,007
Lieutenant.

153
00:10:13,913 --> 00:10:15,654
Jeremy, hey.

154
00:10:15,815 --> 00:10:19,490
I'm Detective Mike Celia,
District Attorney Sharon Westlake.

155
00:10:19,652 --> 00:10:21,757
Harold Gethers,
criminal attorney.

156
00:10:25,158 --> 00:10:26,694
When you see the man
you saw at the store,

157
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:28,498
say his number
and he'll step forward

158
00:10:28,661 --> 00:10:29,662
and repeat one
of the phrases you heard.

159
00:10:29,829 --> 00:10:31,137
What he claims to have heard.

160
00:10:44,777 --> 00:10:46,450
It's number four.

161
00:10:47,847 --> 00:10:50,020
Number four, step forward
and repeat the phrase.

162
00:10:50,183 --> 00:10:51,491
Number four,
please step forward.

163
00:10:51,651 --> 00:10:53,460
Yeah.

164
00:11:04,531 --> 00:11:06,477
Jeremy Thomas Coleman.

165
00:11:06,633 --> 00:11:09,876
- Oh my God.
- Social security number:

166
00:11:10,036 --> 00:11:13,882
434-60-5119.
He lives at-

167
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:17,544
Okay, for the record
I knew nothing about that.

168
00:11:17,710 --> 00:11:20,213
And what he just said does not
constitute an actual threat.

169
00:11:20,380 --> 00:11:22,382
- Your client just read--
- I believe my client

170
00:11:22,549 --> 00:11:24,153
has not been formally identified.

171
00:11:30,390 --> 00:11:32,495
That's him.

172
00:11:32,659 --> 00:11:34,730
We have a responsibility
to our witness

173
00:11:34,894 --> 00:11:36,771
- and I don't mean procedurally.
- Obviously.

174
00:11:36,930 --> 00:11:38,568
I mean emotionally, morally.

175
00:11:40,099 --> 00:11:42,773
- He ID-'d Hagan.
Jeremy needs to know

176
00:11:42,936 --> 00:11:45,883
who he's testifying against
and he needs to know your end of it.

177
00:11:46,039 --> 00:11:48,781
I'm telling you we're gonna have
to play good cop, bad cop here.

178
00:11:48,942 --> 00:11:50,683
All right, tell me about him.

179
00:11:50,843 --> 00:11:53,687
Local, born and bred; parents died
in a fire when he was eight;

180
00:11:53,846 --> 00:11:55,917
couple of group homes,
some juvie stuff;

181
00:11:56,082 --> 00:11:58,255
entered the fire academy,
only job he's ever had.

182
00:11:58,418 --> 00:12:00,193
- No other family?
- Hm-mmm.

183
00:12:00,353 --> 00:12:02,128
Good.
Makes it easier for us.

184
00:12:02,322 --> 00:12:04,598
See you in a minute.

185
00:12:06,192 --> 00:12:08,399
Hello, Jeremy,
thanks for waiting.

186
00:12:12,699 --> 00:12:14,576
Before Detective Cella
gets here,

187
00:12:14,734 --> 00:12:17,578
I'd like to give you some
background information, okay?

188
00:12:18,605 --> 00:12:20,084
Okay.

189
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:23,084
Okay.
A few years ago,

190
00:12:23,243 --> 00:12:25,689
after David Hagan tumed
his Aryan following

191
00:12:25,812 --> 00:12:27,689
in San Quentin into a street crew,

192
00:12:27,814 --> 00:12:29,816
Detective Cella
and his partner decided

193
00:12:29,983 --> 00:12:32,293
to go after his organization.

194
00:12:32,452 --> 00:12:34,898
They made cases against
some of these guys.

195
00:12:36,222 --> 00:12:39,260
They wanted them to flip,
to testify for the state.

196
00:12:40,893 --> 00:12:42,998
That didn't work out.

197
00:12:43,162 --> 00:12:45,267
Hagan killed
Detective Celia's partner

198
00:12:45,431 --> 00:12:47,843
and his partner's wife.

199
00:12:51,304 --> 00:12:53,147
You gonna tell him
how the DA's office

200
00:12:53,306 --> 00:12:55,616
- gave up on the case?
- Stop.

201
00:12:55,775 --> 00:12:57,812
That had nothing to do
with this case.

202
00:12:57,977 --> 00:13:00,287
Yeah, and neither does
a half a dozen or so crimes

203
00:13:00,446 --> 00:13:02,016
on Hagan's rap sheet.

204
00:13:02,181 --> 00:13:04,957
- Tell him the truth!
- The truth is...

205
00:13:06,486 --> 00:13:09,558
we can't get Hagan
unless you testify.

206
00:13:09,722 --> 00:13:12,134
The truth is
Hagan is a sociopath.

207
00:13:12,292 --> 00:13:14,863
He is a stone-cold killer.
He doesn't give a fuck.

208
00:13:15,028 --> 00:13:17,269
I will put you
in witness protection.

209
00:13:17,430 --> 00:13:19,205
The feds will keep you safe.

210
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:23,007
So my whole life just--

211
00:13:23,169 --> 00:13:25,308
just goes away?

212
00:13:25,471 --> 00:13:27,849
You get to keep your first name.

213
00:13:30,510 --> 00:13:32,786
You-- you gotta be
fucking kidding me.

214
00:13:32,945 --> 00:13:36,154
Fucking witness protection.

215
00:13:52,498 --> 00:13:53,875
All right.

216
00:13:56,703 --> 00:13:58,683
I'll do it.

217
00:13:58,838 --> 00:14:02,445
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

218
00:14:04,544 --> 00:14:06,080
I'll do it.

219
00:14:09,449 --> 00:14:11,554
Your driver's license,
Mr. Coleman.

220
00:16:24,784 --> 00:16:26,991
Put your bag
on the side please.

221
00:16:27,153 --> 00:16:29,064
Step on through.

222
00:16:30,056 --> 00:16:31,126
Thank you.

223
00:16:33,025 --> 00:16:34,868
You're late.
Come on.

224
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:39,537
Right through here.

225
00:16:45,071 --> 00:16:47,244
Hey, Mullen.
Mullen, they're here.

226
00:16:47,406 --> 00:16:49,477
Go ahead and patch it in.

227
00:16:50,710 --> 00:16:52,053
Come on in and sit down.

228
00:16:54,881 --> 00:16:57,828
- This is Mike Cella.
- Hey, Lieutenant.

229
00:16:57,984 --> 00:16:59,554
I'm gonna be seeing you soon.

230
00:16:59,719 --> 00:17:02,427
The judge moved the case up.
We go to trial in two weeks.

231
00:17:02,622 --> 00:17:04,568
Oh! Thank God!

232
00:17:06,359 --> 00:17:08,339
I gotta tell you, man,
I am so ready to go home.

233
00:17:08,494 --> 00:17:11,065
I'll be the first to buy
you a beer-- the first of many.

234
00:17:11,230 --> 00:17:14,006
And listen, thank you.
Really thank you, man.

235
00:17:14,166 --> 00:17:16,976
- Take care of yourself, all right?
- Okay.

236
00:17:19,539 --> 00:17:21,519
Congratulations, son.
That's it.

237
00:17:21,674 --> 00:17:22,709
Thank you so much.

238
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:24,218
Thank you very much.

239
00:17:24,377 --> 00:17:26,721
- Mmm.
- Yes!

240
00:17:33,085 --> 00:17:34,120
Thank you.

241
00:17:42,428 --> 00:17:44,874
Taxi taxi!

242
00:17:56,676 --> 00:17:58,622
What the hell do you
think you're doing?

243
00:18:02,048 --> 00:18:03,618
We're US Marshals, not amateurs.

244
00:18:03,783 --> 00:18:06,229
I know you've been sneaking out
of the apartment we got you

245
00:18:06,385 --> 00:18:08,331
- and coming to this motel.
- I've been--

246
00:18:08,487 --> 00:18:09,898
I've been seeing someone.

247
00:18:10,056 --> 00:18:11,626
What, you couldn't wait
till you got back home

248
00:18:11,791 --> 00:18:13,498
to start hooking up
with random girls?

249
00:18:13,693 --> 00:18:15,866
It-- it's not like that, okay?

250
00:18:16,028 --> 00:18:17,405
Oh.

251
00:18:17,563 --> 00:18:19,702
Is she special?

252
00:18:20,733 --> 00:18:21,939
Yeah.

253
00:18:22,101 --> 00:18:24,707
Very.

254
00:18:29,442 --> 00:18:31,422
Now I'm curious.

255
00:18:33,045 --> 00:18:34,456
So tell me about her.

256
00:18:37,984 --> 00:18:40,487
I said tell me about her!

257
00:18:42,488 --> 00:18:44,195
She's kind of a smartass.

258
00:18:44,357 --> 00:18:46,928
So far I like her
- Yeah?

259
00:18:47,927 --> 00:18:50,066
She likes to run her mouth a lot.

260
00:18:56,736 --> 00:18:58,340
She's beautiful.

261
00:18:59,338 --> 00:19:00,817
She forgets that sometimes.

262
00:19:00,973 --> 00:19:02,509
Mm-hmm.

263
00:19:02,675 --> 00:19:04,313
And when this
whole thing is over,

264
00:19:04,477 --> 00:19:06,514
she's coming back
to Long Beach with me.

265
00:19:06,679 --> 00:19:09,182
She's thinking about it.

266
00:19:10,683 --> 00:19:12,663
It wouldn't be dating
in secret anymore.

267
00:19:12,818 --> 00:19:15,094
You'd finally get to meet
all my idiot friends.

268
00:19:16,389 --> 00:19:17,766
It'd be like a real couple.

269
00:19:17,923 --> 00:19:21,166
Maybe you feel a certain way
about this girl right now,

270
00:19:21,327 --> 00:19:23,568
then when you get back home--

271
00:19:23,763 --> 00:19:26,175
Nah. I know how
I feel about her.

272
00:19:31,871 --> 00:19:33,475
Yeah?

273
00:19:35,708 --> 00:19:37,710
Prove it.

274
00:20:04,737 --> 00:20:06,011
Hiya.

275
00:20:06,172 --> 00:20:08,846
Good evening.
Do you have a reservation?

276
00:20:09,008 --> 00:20:11,716
All I have are crossed fingers.

277
00:20:11,877 --> 00:20:14,357
Well, I'll see what I can do for you.

278
00:20:14,513 --> 00:20:17,585
Good golly, you got some
pretty looking nails there, girl.

279
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:20,856
Thank you. Some people say
they match my eyes.

280
00:20:21,020 --> 00:20:22,158
That they do.

281
00:20:23,522 --> 00:20:26,264
Well, it looks like you're in luck.
We have vacancies.

282
00:20:26,425 --> 00:20:27,768
It will run you $89,

283
00:20:27,927 --> 00:20:29,634
- which includes tax.
- It includes tax?

284
00:20:29,829 --> 00:20:31,433
- Mm-hmm.
- All right.

285
00:20:31,597 --> 00:20:34,043
- Will it just be you by yourself?
- Actually me and my buddy.

286
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:35,645
- Okay.
- One room, two beds.

287
00:20:35,835 --> 00:20:37,712
Non-smoking,
a couple of nights.

288
00:20:42,942 --> 00:20:44,922
All right, farther back today.

289
00:20:45,077 --> 00:20:46,750
All right.

290
00:20:50,249 --> 00:20:51,728
All right, go.

291
00:21:00,860 --> 00:21:02,601
Good good.

292
00:21:02,762 --> 00:21:05,140
Better. You're still doing
one thing wrong.

293
00:21:05,297 --> 00:21:08,210
It's what everyone does.
You're anticipating the recoil.

294
00:21:08,334 --> 00:21:10,280
Okay, you're expecting
the gun to kick up,

295
00:21:10,436 --> 00:21:12,211
so you're compensating
by pulling down.

296
00:21:12,338 --> 00:21:13,646
- Okay.
- By the time the gun kicks up,

297
00:21:13,806 --> 00:21:14,910
the bullet's long gone.

298
00:21:15,074 --> 00:21:17,782
Okay, so just forget about the recoil.
It doesn't matter

299
00:21:17,943 --> 00:21:20,355
every single time you pull the trigger.
Put your cans on.

300
00:21:20,513 --> 00:21:22,789
You'd be surprised by
how accurate you can get.

301
00:21:27,486 --> 00:21:31,093
Oh, look at you.
Very cute.

302
00:21:31,257 --> 00:21:32,895
Thank you.

303
00:21:33,058 --> 00:21:34,935
You're right though.
I do hesitate.

304
00:21:35,094 --> 00:21:38,541
It's like every time I get my target
between the crosshairs

305
00:21:38,697 --> 00:21:41,303
I wait a second and then
I start shaking, you know?

306
00:21:41,467 --> 00:21:43,504
You see, but you're not
hitting the target.

307
00:21:43,669 --> 00:21:45,910
The gun is. So you have
to trust the gun.

308
00:21:46,071 --> 00:21:48,551
- Okay.
- Breathe, line up your target

309
00:21:48,707 --> 00:21:50,653
and squeeze.
That's all you do.

310
00:21:57,082 --> 00:21:58,720
Look at that.

311
00:21:59,819 --> 00:22:02,356
Okay, you are now
officially even hotter.

312
00:22:02,521 --> 00:22:04,194
What?

313
00:22:04,356 --> 00:22:06,097
- Kiss me.
- No no no no.

314
00:22:06,258 --> 00:22:09,205
Wait a minute-- another free lesson
and you haven't taught me

315
00:22:09,361 --> 00:22:10,840
anything about firefighting.
Gimme my gun.

316
00:22:10,996 --> 00:22:12,304
Here you go

317
00:22:12,464 --> 00:22:15,001
Well, I don't have my equipment.

318
00:22:15,167 --> 00:22:16,942
And I need a fire, of course.

319
00:22:18,704 --> 00:22:19,876
Come on, tell me something.

320
00:22:20,039 --> 00:22:22,383
I wanna know-- what's your
favorite part about the job,

321
00:22:22,541 --> 00:22:24,418
besides scoring
hot chicks, of course?

322
00:22:24,577 --> 00:22:26,716
That's ridiculous.
I don't know what you're talking about.

323
00:22:26,879 --> 00:22:28,722
Yeah right.

324
00:22:30,216 --> 00:22:32,389
You know, I just love being
part of that group.

325
00:22:32,551 --> 00:22:35,589
Going through all the things you go
through just to become a fireman.

326
00:22:36,956 --> 00:22:39,402
Those guys are my brothers.
I consider them family.

327
00:22:41,594 --> 00:22:43,403
So what's it really like?

328
00:22:43,562 --> 00:22:46,543
I don't know,
most calls are routine.

329
00:22:46,699 --> 00:22:49,009
Every once in a while
you get that--

330
00:22:49,168 --> 00:22:51,205
that call where
all hell's breaking loose

331
00:22:51,370 --> 00:22:54,840
and you got a structure
going up with people inside.

332
00:22:55,007 --> 00:22:57,510
To most people it looks like
a blazing monster, but I understand

333
00:22:57,676 --> 00:22:59,553
how it behaves,
how it progresses,

334
00:22:59,712 --> 00:23:02,693
the airflow, the ventilation,
materials, flashpoints,

335
00:23:02,848 --> 00:23:04,589
construction styles.

336
00:23:04,750 --> 00:23:06,593
I know how to get in,
I know how to get out.

337
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:11,201
I know where I can go. I know
where I can't go. Things like that.

338
00:23:11,357 --> 00:23:14,031
But to the people inside,
all they see is fire and smoke.

339
00:23:14,193 --> 00:23:16,434
You know?
Just heat and blackness.

340
00:23:16,595 --> 00:23:19,439
And sometimes it happens where
that person who's trapped inside--

341
00:23:19,598 --> 00:23:22,204
they don't wanna go.
They panic, they freeze.

342
00:23:22,368 --> 00:23:24,712
Because where I need
to take them

343
00:23:24,870 --> 00:23:28,079
seems a hell of a lot worse
than the spot where they're still alive.

344
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:32,120
- So what do you do?
- I get them to focus on me.

345
00:23:34,213 --> 00:23:36,420
I try to get their eyes.
I try to get their full attention,

346
00:23:36,582 --> 00:23:38,619
even through the mask
and the ventilator.

347
00:23:38,784 --> 00:23:41,287
I say the same thing
every time, no matter what,

348
00:23:41,453 --> 00:23:44,730
because it always works. Kind of like
what you taught me back there.

349
00:23:44,890 --> 00:23:47,268
What do you say?

350
00:23:47,426 --> 00:23:49,064
I say "Trust me.

351
00:23:49,228 --> 00:23:52,732
Do everything that I ask
and I promise you'll stay alive today."

352
00:23:56,468 --> 00:23:59,244
I miss it.

353
00:24:04,276 --> 00:24:06,654
So how long do I have
to be in Long Beach

354
00:24:06,812 --> 00:24:10,282
before I can start calling myself
a California girl?

355
00:24:30,769 --> 00:24:33,010
- Oh, here we go.
- Parking karma.

356
00:24:33,172 --> 00:24:34,708
Yeah.

357
00:24:45,818 --> 00:24:47,456
Jeremy, get down!

358
00:25:00,866 --> 00:25:02,573
Stay down, stay down.

359
00:25:07,706 --> 00:25:10,550
No-ooo!

360
00:25:10,709 --> 00:25:12,120
No!

361
00:25:13,846 --> 00:25:16,554
No! Please please!

362
00:25:17,883 --> 00:25:19,294
Two is down, one is up.

363
00:25:19,451 --> 00:25:21,192
It's okay, it's okay.

364
00:25:21,353 --> 00:25:22,764
You'll be okay. Hold on.

365
00:25:22,921 --> 00:25:24,992
I do not have a shot.

366
00:25:25,157 --> 00:25:28,570
Stay with me, stay with me.

367
00:25:32,664 --> 00:25:35,508
Move back.
We're gonna move back, come on.

368
00:25:43,842 --> 00:25:45,378
Come on, come on.

369
00:25:58,590 --> 00:26:01,036
- Darren.
- I'm hit, I'm hit.

370
00:26:01,193 --> 00:26:02,365
Stay down.

371
00:26:16,542 --> 00:26:19,523
Hey hey hey. It's okay.

372
00:26:34,293 --> 00:26:35,397
Oh shit.

373
00:26:35,561 --> 00:26:37,563
Hey hey he?

374
00:26:44,069 --> 00:26:46,572
Stay with me, come on.
Stay here.

375
00:26:53,145 --> 00:26:55,386
Somebody call 911!

376
00:27:03,655 --> 00:27:05,396
Take a deep breath.

377
00:27:18,670 --> 00:27:20,343
What?

378
00:27:20,506 --> 00:27:22,486
The bullet's in deep.

379
00:27:22,641 --> 00:27:25,247
I'm gonna give you more anesthetic.

380
00:27:40,792 --> 00:27:44,069
What's in the shot?

381
00:27:45,697 --> 00:27:48,371
I can't help you.
You need a trauma surgeon,

382
00:27:48,534 --> 00:27:50,673
a full OR with an anesthesiologist.

383
00:27:50,836 --> 00:27:53,749
We're too far from home.
I can't get you those things.

384
00:27:58,043 --> 00:28:01,889
- You emptied it, right?
- Of course I did.

385
00:28:19,531 --> 00:28:21,169
You wanna talk?

386
00:28:22,234 --> 00:28:24,180
No.

387
00:28:30,742 --> 00:28:32,847
You want the light?

388
00:28:35,113 --> 00:28:37,059
No.

389
00:28:53,065 --> 00:28:56,410
Hey, where is she?
Is she okay?

390
00:28:56,568 --> 00:28:58,104
The wounds are superficial.
She's fine.

391
00:28:58,270 --> 00:29:00,910
I need you to have a seat.
Have a seat and listen.

392
00:29:03,375 --> 00:29:04,945
Three days ago, a case manager

393
00:29:05,110 --> 00:29:07,886
at WITSEC headquarters
in DC was killed.

394
00:29:08,046 --> 00:29:09,957
It looked like a mugging.

395
00:29:10,115 --> 00:29:12,061
They took his watch,
took his wedding ring,

396
00:29:12,217 --> 00:29:13,958
wallet, cash.

397
00:29:14,119 --> 00:29:17,396
But as it turns out,
four hours before he died

398
00:29:17,556 --> 00:29:19,763
he accessed your file.

399
00:29:19,925 --> 00:29:22,235
So they paid him for your location

400
00:29:22,394 --> 00:29:25,432
and then they killed him to tie it up.

401
00:29:27,966 --> 00:29:30,469
Now, son,
this will never happen again.

402
00:29:30,636 --> 00:29:32,946
Access to your records
will be restricted

403
00:29:33,105 --> 00:29:34,846
to the executive office of WITSEC.

404
00:29:35,007 --> 00:29:37,749
All your communications
will be double blind.

405
00:29:37,909 --> 00:29:40,583
Full black box.
Go ahead.

406
00:29:42,114 --> 00:29:45,323
These were found
in the shooter's van.

407
00:29:56,128 --> 00:29:59,268
Oh my God.
You gotta be fucking kidding.

408
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:03,846
Now I'm not judging anybody

409
00:30:04,002 --> 00:30:06,312
not tonight.

410
00:30:06,471 --> 00:30:09,042
I mean,
you're only human.

411
00:30:11,743 --> 00:30:14,451
But why do you think they went
after the both of you?

412
00:30:14,613 --> 00:30:17,617
Hell, you're the witness.
Why not go after you alone?

413
00:30:19,618 --> 00:30:21,689
Because you cared for her.

414
00:30:23,588 --> 00:30:26,694
So the safest thing for both of you
is to be nowhere near one another.

415
00:30:26,858 --> 00:30:29,134
No. No, you need
to let me be with her.

416
00:30:29,294 --> 00:30:30,796
I need to make sure
that she's safe.

417
00:30:30,962 --> 00:30:32,908
- No, she is safe.
- How do you know she's gonna be safe?

418
00:30:33,065 --> 00:30:35,375
She is safe. She's under guard
and wherever she's going--

419
00:30:35,534 --> 00:30:38,606
She's going with me, God damn it!
I need to see her!

420
00:30:38,770 --> 00:30:41,182
Marshal Durham is
on a plane and in the air.

421
00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:43,820
Hell, I don't even know
where it's heading.

422
00:30:43,975 --> 00:30:46,785
And that's for her safety
and for yours!

423
00:30:46,912 --> 00:30:49,483
- What do you mean? She's gone?
- She's gone.

424
00:30:57,022 --> 00:31:00,060
Your new identity is
already being arranged.

425
00:31:00,225 --> 00:31:03,172
When it's done, we'll take you
out of New Orleans.

426
00:31:03,328 --> 00:31:05,399
You've been erased.

427
00:31:05,564 --> 00:31:07,566
You don't exist.

428
00:31:07,733 --> 00:31:10,407
You're a ghost.

429
00:31:10,569 --> 00:31:12,845
But you'll be safe.

430
00:31:16,541 --> 00:31:18,748
When do I get to see her?

431
00:31:20,112 --> 00:31:22,183
Not till after the trial.

432
00:31:22,347 --> 00:31:24,418
You just sit tight.

433
00:31:35,193 --> 00:31:37,867
Hang onto yourself. The case
just bled out all over the street.

434
00:31:38,029 --> 00:31:40,270
There was a hit out on Jeremy,
a federal agent was shot.

435
00:31:40,432 --> 00:31:41,968
- Jeremy Coleman?
- Jeremy's off the grid.

436
00:31:42,134 --> 00:31:44,410
- What federal agent was shot?
- That's all the information I have.

437
00:31:44,569 --> 00:31:46,378
- Who are you talking to?
- The marshals in charge.

438
00:31:46,538 --> 00:31:47,573
All right. Get me on the phone
with them right now.

439
00:31:49,608 --> 00:31:52,384
Lieutenant Cella,
all due respect,

440
00:31:52,544 --> 00:31:56,253
this water's a fair bit deeper
than what you're used to.

441
00:31:56,415 --> 00:31:59,123
You're absolutely right.

442
00:32:00,218 --> 00:32:02,596
I'm just a small-town cop,

443
00:32:02,754 --> 00:32:05,598
so if you could help me
and pick out some small words

444
00:32:05,757 --> 00:32:08,636
and explain to me exactly
how you're gonna protect this guy.

445
00:32:08,794 --> 00:32:11,934
You know I can't provide
you with any details.

446
00:32:12,097 --> 00:32:14,976
Just tell me what kind
of protection you have.

447
00:32:15,133 --> 00:32:17,545
Well, the full weight and resources

448
00:32:17,702 --> 00:32:19,340
of the United States Marshals Service

449
00:32:19,538 --> 00:32:21,245
is being brought to bear.

450
00:32:21,406 --> 00:32:24,319
Yes, I can almost feel it right now.

451
00:32:24,476 --> 00:32:26,649
How about this?
Why don't you just give me the boy?

452
00:32:26,812 --> 00:32:29,418
All right?
He can sleep on my couch.

453
00:32:29,581 --> 00:32:32,994
I got cold beer in the fridge.
I have ESPN on the TV.

454
00:32:33,151 --> 00:32:35,153
I have a 9mm Beretta.

455
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:38,790
I have a Ruger
Security Six .357 Magnum,

456
00:32:38,957 --> 00:32:41,665
a Remington 86 tactical shotgun.

457
00:32:41,827 --> 00:32:44,501
So you tell Hagan's men
if they wanna get this boy,

458
00:32:44,663 --> 00:32:46,506
they're gonna have
to go through me!

459
00:32:46,665 --> 00:32:49,441
Do you understand that,
you third-grade motherfuckers?

460
00:32:53,004 --> 00:32:56,008
Lieutenant, I realize how much
this case means to you.

461
00:33:04,483 --> 00:33:06,394
How's he doing?

462
00:33:07,586 --> 00:33:10,123
Well, he's better than I expected.

463
00:33:10,288 --> 00:33:11,995
He's a tough kid.

464
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:18,206
I want you to tell him
something for me, please.

465
00:33:19,598 --> 00:33:22,078
I want you
to tell him that I said I'm sorry.

466
00:33:23,068 --> 00:33:25,048
Did you hear that?

467
00:33:25,203 --> 00:33:27,308
Tell him I said I'm sorry.

468
00:33:27,472 --> 00:33:30,419
You should tell him
you're sorry, too.

469
00:33:33,011 --> 00:33:35,389
I'm sorry to take up so much
of your time, Marshal.

470
00:33:35,547 --> 00:33:37,686
I know that the federal government
really doesn't--

471
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:03,085
That's what we're doing.

472
00:34:03,241 --> 00:34:05,278
- The unit's open, it's all clear.
- All right.

473
00:34:05,443 --> 00:34:07,081
Why don't you go grab
what you need

474
00:34:07,245 --> 00:34:09,088
and then we'll get you
out of town.

475
00:34:45,317 --> 00:34:46,887
Hello.

476
00:34:47,052 --> 00:34:49,794
My man pulled
your girl's phone records.

477
00:34:51,556 --> 00:34:53,900
Now she dials this number
late at night,

478
00:34:54,059 --> 00:34:56,437
you talk for hours.

479
00:34:58,797 --> 00:35:00,470
See, now you and I,

480
00:35:00,632 --> 00:35:03,272
we never got to talk,
you know, just us.

481
00:35:03,435 --> 00:35:05,472
Yeah, that's a shame.

482
00:35:07,339 --> 00:35:08,909
I'm guessing

483
00:35:09,074 --> 00:35:11,315
you're with the police.

484
00:35:14,980 --> 00:35:16,891
You see,

485
00:35:17,048 --> 00:35:20,052
I can talk to you
in an honest way.

486
00:35:20,185 --> 00:35:22,495
See, in a way they can't.

487
00:35:23,655 --> 00:35:24,895
So let's just--

488
00:35:25,056 --> 00:35:27,662
let's just talk.
Just us, come on.

489
00:35:27,826 --> 00:35:29,601
All right.

490
00:35:32,163 --> 00:35:34,165
It's so simple.

491
00:35:34,332 --> 00:35:36,812
Don't testify

492
00:35:36,968 --> 00:35:39,278
and this will all be over with.

493
00:35:39,437 --> 00:35:41,815
No, it'll be over
once you're sentenced.

494
00:35:41,973 --> 00:35:43,748
You-- you've got--

495
00:35:43,908 --> 00:35:45,910
you've got that
all wrong, see, Jeremy.

496
00:35:46,077 --> 00:35:48,353
See, I go to prison

497
00:35:48,513 --> 00:35:51,494
and I keep running my crew.

498
00:35:51,650 --> 00:35:55,496
I'm gonna keep a contract out
on you and your girlfriend

499
00:35:55,654 --> 00:35:56,962
for as long as it takes.

500
00:35:57,122 --> 00:36:00,194
And this won't be over
until the both of you are dead.

501
00:36:00,358 --> 00:36:02,668
Now-- now that can
happen anywhere.

502
00:36:02,827 --> 00:36:04,636
Yeah.

503
00:36:04,796 --> 00:36:06,833
Let me see.

504
00:36:06,998 --> 00:36:09,205
How about

505
00:36:09,367 --> 00:36:11,369
Monticello, Indiana?

506
00:36:11,536 --> 00:36:13,174
At the lake house,

507
00:36:13,338 --> 00:36:16,148
where your girl's family
has reunions.

508
00:36:16,307 --> 00:36:19,550
I think the next one's in July.
I can't wait to go to that one.

509
00:36:22,013 --> 00:36:24,687
Hey, when are the two
of you getting married?

510
00:36:26,351 --> 00:36:28,490
I bet that's gonna be
a special day, huh?

511
00:36:28,653 --> 00:36:31,532
You gonna invite all your
family and friends...

512
00:36:31,690 --> 00:36:34,170
Craig, Adam,

513
00:36:34,325 --> 00:36:35,668
Trey!

514
00:36:35,827 --> 00:36:38,273
Carlos...

515
00:36:38,430 --> 00:36:40,501
and how about
a couple of my guys?

516
00:36:44,669 --> 00:36:47,206
Or maybe I'll just wait.

517
00:36:48,239 --> 00:36:49,877
You know,

518
00:36:50,041 --> 00:36:52,419
maybe I'll just wait for years

519
00:36:52,577 --> 00:36:55,581
until you and your girl,

520
00:36:55,747 --> 00:36:57,693
you got some kids of your own.

521
00:36:57,849 --> 00:37:00,762
Then my men..

522
00:37:02,620 --> 00:37:05,430
They'll come and kill them
while you watch.

523
00:37:07,092 --> 00:37:10,198
You see, what you don't
understand, Jeremy, is...

524
00:37:14,399 --> 00:37:16,845
prison time

525
00:37:17,001 --> 00:37:20,073
ain't nothing but time.

526
00:37:20,238 --> 00:37:22,411
Now you wanna live
the rest of your life

527
00:37:22,574 --> 00:37:24,952
knowing that one day--

528
00:37:25,110 --> 00:37:27,090
one day, son,

529
00:37:27,245 --> 00:37:29,486
I will find you?

530
00:37:29,647 --> 00:37:32,287
No, you're not gonna touch her.

531
00:37:34,252 --> 00:37:37,028
I'll kill you before I let that happen.

532
00:37:41,726 --> 00:37:43,330
Look,

533
00:37:43,495 --> 00:37:46,135
testify, don't testify,

534
00:37:46,297 --> 00:37:47,799
you're both dead anyway.

535
00:37:47,966 --> 00:37:49,502
That's just for talking back.

536
00:37:49,667 --> 00:37:52,443
No, you listen to me,
you son of a bitch, you're dead.

537
00:37:52,604 --> 00:37:53,947
You hear me?

538
00:37:54,105 --> 00:37:55,743
You are fucking dead.

539
00:37:55,907 --> 00:37:59,912
You tell me exactly how someone
like you's gonna kill me.

540
00:38:00,078 --> 00:38:02,786
Because I'm a ghost.
I don't exist.

541
00:38:02,947 --> 00:38:05,689
I'm gonna find you.
I'm gonna kill you.

542
00:38:05,884 --> 00:38:08,455
I'm gonna disappear
and nobody will ever know.

543
00:38:08,620 --> 00:38:11,226
To hell with witness protection.

544
00:38:11,356 --> 00:38:13,131
You're gonna need
protection from me.

545
00:38:13,291 --> 00:38:15,328
I'm gonna need protection from you?

546
00:38:18,963 --> 00:38:20,499
Oh shit!

547
00:38:20,665 --> 00:38:23,669
I'm gonna need
protection from you.

548
00:38:26,838 --> 00:38:28,374
Shit.

549
00:38:29,674 --> 00:38:32,621
Fuck. Oh fuck. Fuck.

550
00:38:40,151 --> 00:38:41,960
Lost

551
00:38:43,288 --> 00:38:46,497
You've been
so lost to me

552
00:38:46,658 --> 00:38:49,002
And the cost

553
00:38:50,395 --> 00:38:54,639
It's killed me
to set you free

554
00:38:55,867 --> 00:38:57,369
But I...

555
00:38:57,535 --> 00:38:59,208
Why don't you go hurry him up?

556
00:38:59,370 --> 00:39:03,284
Just can't stand
to lose you now

557
00:39:03,408 --> 00:39:06,753
- No, I...
- Jeremy?

558
00:39:06,945 --> 00:39:09,221
Just can't stand

559
00:39:09,380 --> 00:39:13,055
To lose you now...

560
00:39:14,586 --> 00:39:16,361
How we doing?

561
00:39:18,223 --> 00:39:19,964
Jeremy?

562
00:39:21,659 --> 00:39:22,763
Ah

563
00:39:32,570 --> 00:39:34,743
Hey! He's running!

564
00:39:34,906 --> 00:39:36,408
Hey!

565
00:39:37,508 --> 00:39:39,681
- He's running!
- Stay off the radios!

566
00:39:39,844 --> 00:39:42,347
Find him,
but we've gotta keep this quiet

567
00:39:42,513 --> 00:39:43,753
for his own protection!

568
00:39:43,915 --> 00:39:45,758
Shit!

569
00:39:45,917 --> 00:39:48,727
I can't stand

570
00:39:48,887 --> 00:39:50,889
To lose you now

571
00:39:51,055 --> 00:39:54,366
I...

572
00:39:54,525 --> 00:39:58,371
Can't stand
to lose you now

573
00:39:58,529 --> 00:40:01,738
I...

574
00:40:01,900 --> 00:40:06,110
Can't stand
to lose you now

575
00:40:06,271 --> 00:40:09,582
No, I...

576
00:40:09,741 --> 00:40:14,121
Can't stand to lose

577
00:40:14,279 --> 00:40:18,421
You now...

578
00:40:32,230 --> 00:40:34,301
That's truly horrifying.

579
00:40:36,801 --> 00:40:38,109
Thank God Mr. Coleman

580
00:40:38,269 --> 00:40:40,806
survived these hideous
acts of random violence.

581
00:40:42,307 --> 00:40:44,651
How do you say that shit
with a straight face?

582
00:40:44,809 --> 00:40:45,810
Your Honor?

583
00:40:45,977 --> 00:40:48,150
The police are executing
search warrants right now

584
00:40:48,313 --> 00:40:50,691
on Hagan and all of his people.

585
00:40:50,848 --> 00:40:53,260
I'm confident those warrants
will prove fruitless.

586
00:40:53,418 --> 00:40:54,761
Come on,
physical proof or not,

587
00:40:54,919 --> 00:40:57,593
basic common sense says that
Hagan needs to be locked up.

588
00:40:57,755 --> 00:40:59,928
Your Honor, I'm asking you
to revoke that bail order.

589
00:41:01,326 --> 00:41:03,328
Your Honor,
may I speak plainly?

590
00:41:04,395 --> 00:41:05,840
If there was someone out there,

591
00:41:05,997 --> 00:41:07,977
operating independently of my client,

592
00:41:08,132 --> 00:41:10,669
attempting to bring harm
to Mr. Coleman,

593
00:41:10,835 --> 00:41:13,873
incarcerating my client
will do nothing to prevent that.

594
00:41:14,072 --> 00:41:16,348
In the absence
of actual evidence of any sort,

595
00:41:16,507 --> 00:41:18,987
all you'd be doing,
with due respect, Your Honor,

596
00:41:19,143 --> 00:41:21,783
is demonstrating extreme prejudice

597
00:41:21,946 --> 00:41:24,017
and providing me
with grounds for appeal

598
00:41:24,182 --> 00:41:26,321
of any future conviction,
not to mention

599
00:41:26,484 --> 00:41:29,488
grounds for a complete dismissal.
Now in regards to that,

600
00:41:29,654 --> 00:41:31,827
I welcome such an action.

601
00:41:31,990 --> 00:41:34,436
By all means, lock him up.

602
00:41:47,005 --> 00:41:49,884
Saw some robberies
and could be some missing bodies

603
00:41:50,041 --> 00:41:52,988
Another killing hat,
someone paying for this murder rap

604
00:41:53,144 --> 00:41:54,145
Fuck the Jimmy shit...

605
00:41:54,312 --> 00:41:57,225
Man, who's this Wonder-Bread-lookin'
motherfucker walkin' around?

606
00:42:00,385 --> 00:42:02,023
Hey, can I talk
to you guys for a second?

607
00:42:02,186 --> 00:42:04,132
You in the wrong
neighborhood, cuz.

608
00:42:04,288 --> 00:42:07,201
- I'm not looking for trouble.
- Nah, fuck that, man.

609
00:42:07,358 --> 00:42:09,463
You ought to get you a hat
that says "Undercover Cop."

610
00:42:09,594 --> 00:42:12,200
- I'm not a cop.
- You better not be, motherfucker,

611
00:42:12,363 --> 00:42:14,138
'cause you fucking suck at it.

612
00:42:14,298 --> 00:42:16,039
Keep on walking, cuz,

613
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:18,202
you gonna scare off
my customers and shit.

614
00:42:18,369 --> 00:42:19,905
I am a customer.

615
00:42:20,938 --> 00:42:23,316
All right?
I want a gun.

616
00:42:23,474 --> 00:42:24,612
Gun store, homie.

617
00:42:24,776 --> 00:42:26,778
I want a gun that can't be traced.

618
00:42:26,944 --> 00:42:28,753
Look here, cuz.

619
00:42:28,913 --> 00:42:31,052
- We don't sell steel to white boys.
- I'm not looking for any--

620
00:42:31,215 --> 00:42:33,058
Jesus.

621
00:42:33,217 --> 00:42:34,958
God, oh!

622
00:42:35,153 --> 00:42:36,791
See what the fuck you did?

623
00:42:36,954 --> 00:42:39,730
Trying to tell your ass.
Now you done fuck with the muscle.

624
00:42:42,393 --> 00:42:44,930
Put your teeth on the curb, man.

625
00:42:45,096 --> 00:42:47,201
Hey, cuz, let me
"American History X" this boy.

626
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:51,607
I always wanted to do that.

627
00:42:51,769 --> 00:42:54,511
- I'm not a cop!
- Shut the fuck up!

628
00:42:57,341 --> 00:42:59,878
L-- I need the gun
to kill David Hagan.

629
00:43:00,044 --> 00:43:02,115
I wanna kill David Hagan.

630
00:43:04,515 --> 00:43:06,256
Don't fuck with me, boy.

631
00:43:06,417 --> 00:43:08,419
Let's take a ride, cuz.

632
00:43:08,586 --> 00:43:10,588
Hey, Wonder Bread,
get your ass up.

633
00:43:12,957 --> 00:43:14,561
I got it.

634
00:43:14,725 --> 00:43:16,796
Get your ass in the car.

635
00:43:20,598 --> 00:43:22,669
No, fool, not the back seat.

636
00:43:22,834 --> 00:43:24,472
Get your ass in the trunk.

637
00:43:26,904 --> 00:43:28,747
I can ride in the back
fucking seat, man.

638
00:43:28,906 --> 00:43:30,977
Get your ass
in the motherfucking trunk!

639
00:43:32,143 --> 00:43:34,145
Put this on.

640
00:43:34,312 --> 00:43:37,156
You'll get there safe--
just in the dark.

641
00:43:52,096 --> 00:43:54,269
Lamar!

642
00:43:57,101 --> 00:43:59,103
Lamar!
We got company.

643
00:44:07,145 --> 00:44:08,624
Welcome to the Eastside.

644
00:44:08,779 --> 00:44:12,249
Yeah. Why you ain't up
in Bixby Knolls?

645
00:44:12,416 --> 00:44:15,022
- Problems at the country club?
- I ain't from Bixby Knolls.

646
00:44:15,186 --> 00:44:16,961
You sure as fuck
ain't from here either.

647
00:44:17,121 --> 00:44:19,533
So we got a white boy

648
00:44:19,690 --> 00:44:21,636
who wants to smoke Hagan.

649
00:44:21,792 --> 00:44:24,671
- Ain't this a bitch?
- It's a long story, but it's him or me.

650
00:44:24,829 --> 00:44:27,639
- And who are you?
- Nobody, cuz.

651
00:44:27,798 --> 00:44:29,971
That's right.
Nobody, literally nobody.

652
00:44:30,134 --> 00:44:31,841
But if I do pull this off,
Hagan'll be gone,

653
00:44:32,003 --> 00:44:33,539
and you guys can take the credit.

654
00:44:33,704 --> 00:44:36,150
I know that he's competition for you.

655
00:44:36,307 --> 00:44:38,548
I could be doing you guys a favor.

656
00:44:38,709 --> 00:44:40,450
Pffft.
Stone cold Bixby!

657
00:44:40,611 --> 00:44:44,684
Man, fuck this shit, man.
He wasting your fuckin' time, nigga.

658
00:44:44,849 --> 00:44:47,056
Let us take him
out the back, cuz. Trust me.

659
00:44:52,323 --> 00:44:54,997
Naw. He's a customer.

660
00:44:55,159 --> 00:44:56,399
C'mon.

661
00:45:13,744 --> 00:45:15,121
What a selection.

662
00:45:16,247 --> 00:45:18,193
Now what you trying to do, man,
you gonna need

663
00:45:18,349 --> 00:45:20,659
- some motherfuckin' weight. Trust me.
- The Glock 21.

664
00:45:20,785 --> 00:45:22,560
- The Glock 21?
- Yeah.

665
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:25,030
You hear this white motherfucker?

666
00:45:25,189 --> 00:45:27,931
Glock 21, man, you could've got
this shit from Kmart, man!

667
00:45:28,092 --> 00:45:29,799
From aisle one
next to the Pampers!

668
00:45:29,961 --> 00:45:31,736
Look at this motherfucker,
take a look at that shit.

669
00:45:31,896 --> 00:45:33,705
We got AK-47s over here, dawg.

670
00:45:33,864 --> 00:45:36,242
- I don't know how to shoot the AK-47.
- Check this shit out, man.

671
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:38,607
You tryin' to be the motherfucking
Grim Reaper and shit?

672
00:45:38,769 --> 00:45:41,773
- You gonna have to get grim.
- I learned how to shoot on this gun.

673
00:45:41,939 --> 00:45:43,680
- Fuck that.
- I learned how to fuck

674
00:45:43,808 --> 00:45:45,253
on this dumb bitch
at the rec center.

675
00:45:45,409 --> 00:45:47,411
Her grill all fucked up,
teeth sideways,

676
00:45:47,578 --> 00:45:49,785
throwing gang signs
and titties hanging 'em out.

677
00:45:49,947 --> 00:45:52,450
Man, I'm hard bangin' that shit, man,
but then I upgraded.

678
00:45:52,617 --> 00:45:54,688
- You know what I'm sayin'?
- Hey, shut the fuck up!

679
00:45:54,819 --> 00:45:56,890
Enough of that shit, all right?

680
00:46:00,558 --> 00:46:02,560
Can I?

681
00:46:03,928 --> 00:46:05,430
Can this be traced?

682
00:46:05,596 --> 00:46:07,576
No, it can't be
motherfuckin' traced.

683
00:46:07,732 --> 00:46:09,643
The shit ain't even been fired.

684
00:46:09,800 --> 00:46:12,713
The serial number's been filed out.
That's virgin steel.

685
00:46:17,475 --> 00:46:20,922
Hey, look, now you wondering
if I think you can kill Hagan?

686
00:46:22,813 --> 00:46:25,191
I don't know
what the fuck you can do.

687
00:46:27,385 --> 00:46:29,592
But I think you could be trouble.

688
00:46:29,754 --> 00:46:31,734
You could occupy some of his time.

689
00:46:31,856 --> 00:46:36,202
Even if it's only 30 minutes when he
gain' somewhere to drop off your body.

690
00:46:38,763 --> 00:46:42,142
500 for the piece, man.
Bullets are on the house.

691
00:46:49,607 --> 00:46:51,348
Give it to him.

692
00:47:02,787 --> 00:47:04,425
I hope you got some gas money left

693
00:47:04,588 --> 00:47:07,194
in them motherfuckin' pockets
of yours, motherfucker.

694
00:47:50,935 --> 00:47:52,039
Jeremy?

695
00:47:52,203 --> 00:47:55,241
Yeah, I had a feeling
you'd answer this phone.

696
00:47:58,642 --> 00:48:00,644
I wasn't supposed to, but...

697
00:48:01,912 --> 00:48:03,516
I knew you'd call.

698
00:48:03,681 --> 00:48:05,957
How are you?

699
00:48:07,485 --> 00:48:10,056
I'm a little woozy,
a little tired, but...

700
00:48:11,355 --> 00:48:12,959
I'm fine.

701
00:48:13,124 --> 00:48:15,968
I'm just sad I missed
all your heroics.

702
00:48:16,127 --> 00:48:17,504
That's all right.

703
00:48:17,661 --> 00:48:20,403
It'll give me a chance
to exaggerate it later.

704
00:48:22,266 --> 00:48:24,109
Jeremy?

705
00:48:25,870 --> 00:48:28,146
You have to come back in.

706
00:48:28,305 --> 00:48:30,785
I know that things got bad,

707
00:48:30,941 --> 00:48:34,150
but you can't be
out there on your own.

708
00:48:34,311 --> 00:48:37,451
So wherever it is that you are,
please just go to a police station

709
00:48:37,615 --> 00:48:39,959
and tell them to call the marshals.

710
00:48:40,117 --> 00:48:42,620
Okay? You're not safe.

711
00:48:42,787 --> 00:48:44,460
But you are safe.

712
00:48:44,622 --> 00:48:47,296
That's the only thing
that matters to me.

713
00:48:49,860 --> 00:48:52,306
Whatever happens,
I want you to know that.

714
00:48:55,566 --> 00:48:58,274
Please don't do this to me.

715
00:48:59,537 --> 00:49:01,175
Jeremy?

716
00:49:03,607 --> 00:49:05,712
I love you.

717
00:49:08,712 --> 00:49:10,623
Get rid of this phone.

718
00:49:10,781 --> 00:49:13,318
I'm not gonna call you again.

719
00:49:13,484 --> 00:49:14,929
No, Jeremy»

720
00:49:52,022 --> 00:49:54,525
- What'd I fucking tell you?
- Oh shit.

721
00:49:54,692 --> 00:49:57,605
For fuck's sake!
Talk to him tomorrow.

722
00:49:57,761 --> 00:49:59,934
He's working at the Obispo.

723
00:50:00,064 --> 00:50:02,510
Right there.
Hands up!

724
00:50:02,666 --> 00:50:05,704
Jeremy fucking Coleman.

725
00:50:07,137 --> 00:50:08,775
You throw it away.

726
00:50:08,939 --> 00:50:10,543
Throw your fuckin' gun!

727
00:50:11,542 --> 00:50:14,045
Calm down.
Calm yourself down.

728
00:50:14,211 --> 00:50:15,713
- Around the corner.
- What?

729
00:50:15,880 --> 00:50:17,621
Get around the fucking corner!

730
00:50:20,818 --> 00:50:22,661
- It's Gethers.
- Hold on.

731
00:50:22,820 --> 00:50:25,096
All right. Later.

732
00:50:25,256 --> 00:50:26,701
What's up?

733
00:50:26,857 --> 00:50:29,201
He wants to talk about
your plea bargain.

734
00:50:30,194 --> 00:50:32,037
Oh, he does?

735
00:50:33,531 --> 00:50:36,068
Let's go run an errand.

736
00:50:36,233 --> 00:50:38,873
- Go to the fuckin' corner!
- This is a fuckin' big mistake.

737
00:50:39,036 --> 00:50:40,811
Shut the fuck up and get
against the wall.

738
00:50:46,710 --> 00:50:48,053
All right. Sit down.

739
00:50:48,212 --> 00:50:49,919
Back against the wall!

740
00:50:56,921 --> 00:50:58,696
Okay, now what?

741
00:50:58,856 --> 00:51:01,063
I'm gonna kill Hagan.

742
00:51:01,225 --> 00:51:03,296
- Is that so?
- That's right.

743
00:51:03,460 --> 00:51:05,906
What's "Obispo"?
Who's gonna be there?

744
00:51:08,299 --> 00:51:09,710
Throw me your phone.

745
00:51:14,572 --> 00:51:17,382
When I was a kid,
I wanted to be a boxer.

746
00:51:17,541 --> 00:51:19,885
I worked and worked,

747
00:51:20,044 --> 00:51:22,046
but then I realized
it wasn't gonna happen,

748
00:51:22,212 --> 00:51:23,885
because I didn't have it in me.

749
00:51:25,683 --> 00:51:27,685
You tell me how to get to Hagan.

750
00:51:27,851 --> 00:51:30,593
Now you wanna be
some badass assassin,

751
00:51:30,754 --> 00:51:33,291
but you haven't got it in you.

752
00:51:37,962 --> 00:51:39,964
Dude, I will shoot you
in the fucking knee

753
00:51:40,130 --> 00:51:43,077
if you don't tell me how to get
to Hagan. Do you understand me?

754
00:51:51,241 --> 00:51:54,154
Henry Cooper had 4% body fat.

755
00:51:54,311 --> 00:51:57,190
Now do I look like
I've got 4% body fat?

756
00:51:57,348 --> 00:52:00,921
No. And you ain't gonna
pull that fucking trigger!

757
00:52:07,291 --> 00:52:09,134
Fuck!

758
00:52:13,163 --> 00:52:15,666
Wait wait! Fuck!

759
00:52:19,069 --> 00:52:21,071
Ah, so you're one of those, huh?

760
00:52:21,205 --> 00:52:22,650
Wait please.

761
00:52:24,908 --> 00:52:27,320
Whoo. Come on.
What you got there? What you got?

762
00:52:40,791 --> 00:52:41,963
Whoo-ee!

763
00:52:51,101 --> 00:52:53,138
Oh shit. Fuck.

764
00:52:53,303 --> 00:52:55,044
Fuck.

765
00:53:06,183 --> 00:53:08,493
The Aryan brother

766
00:53:08,652 --> 00:53:10,689
is without care.

767
00:53:12,823 --> 00:53:15,201
He walks where the weak

768
00:53:15,359 --> 00:53:18,499
and the heartless won't dare.

769
00:53:21,732 --> 00:53:25,236
For the Aryan brother, death holds

770
00:53:25,402 --> 00:53:28,281
no fear.

771
00:53:29,740 --> 00:53:32,516
Vengeance will be his...

772
00:53:34,144 --> 00:53:36,090
through his brothers

773
00:53:37,081 --> 00:53:38,992
still there.

774
00:54:25,129 --> 00:54:27,234
Oh shit, oh shit.

775
00:54:38,275 --> 00:54:40,277
Throw your weapons out!

776
00:54:41,311 --> 00:54:43,882
If you're hurt, I can help you,

777
00:54:44,047 --> 00:54:45,651
but you gotta throw out
your weapons!

778
00:55:29,526 --> 00:55:31,699
George, please tell me
that's not a dead guy.

779
00:55:31,862 --> 00:55:34,365
- It's a dead guy.
- Are you fucking kidding me?

780
00:55:34,531 --> 00:55:36,374
It's a terrible tragedy, huh?

781
00:55:36,533 --> 00:55:38,740
It's a fucked up weekend
is what it is.

782
00:55:38,936 --> 00:55:41,212
Fuck. Who is this?

783
00:55:41,371 --> 00:55:44,215
Looks like he gotjumped and his buddies
in the SUV down there,

784
00:55:44,374 --> 00:55:46,115
they came riding to the rescue,

785
00:55:46,276 --> 00:55:48,586
but I'm pretty sure it didn't work out.

786
00:55:48,745 --> 00:55:52,283
- What is that shit carved in his face?
- It's E.C., Eastside Crips.

787
00:55:52,416 --> 00:55:54,828
This is gang retaliation.

788
00:55:56,687 --> 00:55:59,224
Yeah. Yeah yeah,
what do you got for me?

789
00:56:02,559 --> 00:56:05,506
- Hey, Lieutenant?
- Hey, what's up?

790
00:56:05,662 --> 00:56:07,903
- I thought you should see this.
- What is it?

791
00:56:08,065 --> 00:56:10,671
Partial print.
It's not much, but I think

792
00:56:10,834 --> 00:56:12,245
- we can get a hit off of it.
- All right.

793
00:56:12,402 --> 00:56:15,246
Take this to the lab.
Get the results back to me.

794
00:56:15,405 --> 00:56:17,612
- Only me.
- Only you.

795
00:56:17,774 --> 00:56:18,912
Thanks, Paul.

796
00:56:23,914 --> 00:56:26,588
- Hello?
- Lieutenant Cella.

797
00:56:26,750 --> 00:56:29,526
- Who is this?
- I think it's time we met

798
00:56:29,686 --> 00:56:31,927
face to face.

799
00:57:53,937 --> 00:57:56,850
This just in, breaking news
out of Long Beach:

800
00:57:57,007 --> 00:58:00,682
a man nearly beaten to death. Let's go
now to our field reporter at the scene.

801
00:58:00,844 --> 00:58:04,291
The victim, Craig Tucker,
is listed in critical condition.

802
00:58:04,448 --> 00:58:07,019
Those injuries are described
as being very severe,

803
00:58:07,184 --> 00:58:10,631
and it is not immediately clear
whether or not he will recover.

804
00:58:10,787 --> 00:58:13,666
A police spokesman says
the search for suspects is ongoing.

805
00:58:13,824 --> 00:58:16,998
But they have no further comment.
Back to you.

806
00:58:17,160 --> 00:58:20,198
In other news,
citizens are outraged...

807
00:58:29,373 --> 00:58:32,980
- Wait for me.
- Come on, slowpoke.

808
00:58:33,143 --> 00:58:35,487
No no, I'm heading
to the hospital before my shift.

809
00:58:35,645 --> 00:58:38,057
Shh shh shh shh.

810
00:58:38,215 --> 00:58:39,660
- Uh...
- Shut it off.

811
00:58:39,816 --> 00:58:41,762
Yeah.
Look, I'll see you there.

812
00:58:41,918 --> 00:58:43,226
No questions,

813
00:58:43,387 --> 00:58:45,389
just listen to me.

814
00:58:45,555 --> 00:58:48,126
I need you to do exactly
what I tell you to do, okay?

815
00:58:48,291 --> 00:58:50,567
- Okay. Yeah.
- I need you to let everybody know

816
00:58:50,727 --> 00:58:54,072
that they gotta be very careful
right now. Nobody stays at their place.

817
00:58:54,231 --> 00:58:57,405
Call the police and say that threats
have been made against the firehouse.

818
00:58:57,567 --> 00:59:00,411
Get a police detail, not only
on the station, but on all your runs.

819
00:59:00,570 --> 00:59:01,708
You kidding me?
You know it's not that easy.

820
00:59:01,872 --> 00:59:05,012
Just do it! Okay?
Just fucking do it!

821
00:59:06,410 --> 00:59:08,321
And don't tell anybody
that you've seen me.

822
00:59:08,478 --> 00:59:10,583
Nobody-- not the guys,
not Maria, nobody.

823
00:59:12,416 --> 00:59:15,761
I can't see fucking Craig and he's
sitting in the fucking hospital!

824
00:59:20,390 --> 00:59:22,028
Is he gonna be okay?
Have they heard?

825
00:59:22,192 --> 00:59:25,503
I don't know, man.
It's not looking good.

826
00:59:26,797 --> 00:59:28,970
Jeremy, talk to me, dude.
What are you doing?

827
00:59:29,166 --> 00:59:31,237
Just no questions, please!

828
00:59:33,937 --> 00:59:35,939
So how's Maria?
Is she good?

829
00:59:38,442 --> 00:59:40,080
You met somebody.

830
00:59:44,114 --> 00:59:45,616
Yeah.

831
00:59:45,782 --> 00:59:48,922
I just hope to God you guys get
a chance to meet her someday.

832
00:59:50,053 --> 00:59:51,964
I need you to do me a favor.

833
00:59:52,122 --> 00:59:54,068
All my fire gear is
over at the fire house.

834
00:59:54,224 --> 00:59:57,671
Before your shift, I need you
to go drop my duffel bag off

835
00:59:57,828 --> 01:00:00,138
over in the park
behind those benches, okay?

836
01:00:01,231 --> 01:00:03,211
And one more thing.

837
01:00:04,534 --> 01:00:06,377
If you don't hear from me
in the next few days,

838
01:00:06,536 --> 01:00:08,812
I need you to take this.
There's a letter next to the bed.

839
01:00:08,972 --> 01:00:11,316
Take it to the US Marshals' Service,
all right?

840
01:00:11,475 --> 01:00:14,217
- They'll know how to get it to her.
- Who is she?

841
01:00:15,212 --> 01:00:16,486
Just..

842
01:00:16,646 --> 01:00:18,557
Just do it for me.

843
01:00:22,486 --> 01:00:24,989
Yeah. All right.

844
01:00:26,089 --> 01:00:28,000
Okay.

845
01:00:39,436 --> 01:00:42,679
- Hello.
- Hey, what's up, Paul?

846
01:00:47,110 --> 01:00:49,784
So I ran that print.

847
01:00:49,946 --> 01:00:53,519
It came back with a hit.
It's in the system, this person,

848
01:00:53,683 --> 01:00:55,822
the only problem is
it's coming back with no ID.

849
01:00:55,986 --> 01:00:57,363
- No name, no nothing?
- No.

850
01:00:57,521 --> 01:00:59,194
I figure it must
have been in there,

851
01:00:59,356 --> 01:01:01,165
but for some reason

852
01:01:01,324 --> 01:01:03,895
it got taken out?
You ever heard of that?

853
01:01:06,163 --> 01:01:07,198
No.

854
01:01:09,699 --> 01:01:10,734
Thank you.

855
01:01:40,297 --> 01:01:42,072
- This is dispatch.
- Mike Cella.

856
01:01:42,232 --> 01:01:45,304
- Lieutenant?
- I need to put out an APB on a suspect.

857
01:01:46,770 --> 01:01:48,681
Go ahead with your description.

858
01:01:53,210 --> 01:01:54,951
Lieutenant?

859
01:01:57,214 --> 01:01:59,091
- I'm gonna have to call you back.
- Sir?

860
01:01:59,249 --> 01:02:01,422
No no, I don't have
the right information yet.

861
01:02:14,064 --> 01:02:17,238
This is Talia Durham.
Badge 4382.

862
01:02:17,400 --> 01:02:19,038
I need an override
on a blocked number

863
01:02:19,202 --> 01:02:22,274
incoming to my old cell
last night around 12:00.

864
01:02:26,409 --> 01:02:28,946
Area code 562? That's--

865
01:02:29,112 --> 01:02:31,592
that's Long Beach, California, right?

866
01:02:33,683 --> 01:02:35,720
It's a cell. Great.

867
01:02:35,885 --> 01:02:37,455
Thank-- thank you.

868
01:02:55,805 --> 01:02:57,910
Hi, yes.
I need a cab to the airport.

869
01:02:59,976 --> 01:03:01,956
No, right now.
Thank you.

870
01:03:32,008 --> 01:03:34,420
That V8 is rumbling

871
01:03:35,412 --> 01:03:37,892
I feel right at home

872
01:03:39,582 --> 01:03:42,586
When I push the hammer down

873
01:03:42,752 --> 01:03:45,858
I hear the engine moan

874
01:03:47,123 --> 01:03:49,865
I'm up in seventh heaven

875
01:03:50,026 --> 01:03:52,802
And I don't wanna come down

876
01:03:54,831 --> 01:03:59,007
'Cause I'm alive when
I hear that Mustang sound

877
01:04:02,639 --> 01:04:06,712
Yeah, I'm alive when I hear
that Mustang sound

878
01:04:11,981 --> 01:04:14,723
This is a lifetime affair...

879
01:04:17,520 --> 01:04:19,864
Welcome to the party, motherfucker!

880
01:04:22,092 --> 01:04:25,073
God damn.
Jeremy Coleman!

881
01:04:25,228 --> 01:04:28,368
Hagan's gonna love me.
I'm bringing you back alive!

882
01:04:28,531 --> 01:04:31,944
Hell, he just might make me
employee of the motherfucking week!

883
01:04:33,737 --> 01:04:34,909
What?
You want that?

884
01:04:35,071 --> 01:04:37,244
Do you want this gun, huh?
Is this what you want?

885
01:04:37,407 --> 01:04:39,080
You ain't gettin' it, motherfucker.

886
01:04:39,242 --> 01:04:41,188
You in my house now,
you hear me?

887
01:04:41,344 --> 01:04:43,517
You don't bring no gun
to my fuckin' party.

888
01:04:43,680 --> 01:04:45,887
Who do you think you are,
comin' in here?

889
01:04:46,049 --> 01:04:47,585
Act like you own
this fuckin' place.

890
01:04:47,751 --> 01:04:50,061
I'm gonna stick this gun
right up your ass.

891
01:04:50,220 --> 01:04:52,097
God damn it!

892
01:04:52,255 --> 01:04:54,735
Ah ahhh ahhh.

893
01:04:54,891 --> 01:04:56,564
My fuckin' leg!

894
01:05:05,101 --> 01:05:07,138
Get up and crawl,
you son of a bitch.

895
01:05:07,303 --> 01:05:10,773
Right here.
Sit right there.

896
01:05:18,715 --> 01:05:21,559
You caught me at a bad time.
I'm about to kill some Crips.

897
01:05:21,718 --> 01:05:24,096
I put a trace
on the marshal's credit cards.

898
01:05:24,254 --> 01:05:26,791
Nothing since New Orleans.

899
01:05:26,956 --> 01:05:29,163
Today she bought
a last-minute plane ticket.

900
01:05:29,325 --> 01:05:30,929
I'm already here in Long Beach.

901
01:05:31,094 --> 01:05:34,871
There's only one reason
she'd leave protection and come here.

902
01:05:34,998 --> 01:05:36,306
He's here.

903
01:05:37,300 --> 01:05:38,574
God damn it.

904
01:05:44,073 --> 01:05:46,110
I need you to tell me
how to get to Hagan.

905
01:05:46,276 --> 01:05:47,721
Where does he go?

906
01:05:47,877 --> 01:05:49,982
- When is he alone?
- Blood in, blood out.

907
01:05:50,146 --> 01:05:51,625
What is that
supposed to mean?

908
01:05:51,781 --> 01:05:54,455
To get in with Hagan,
you gotta kill somebody--

909
01:05:54,617 --> 01:05:56,790
blood in.
Once you're in,

910
01:05:56,953 --> 01:05:59,297
the only way out's
if you're dead-- blood out.

911
01:05:59,456 --> 01:06:00,901
So fuck you!

912
01:06:01,024 --> 01:06:04,301
Mr. Hagan, your men were
killed by Jeremy Coleman.

913
01:06:05,995 --> 01:06:08,498
Well, it looks
like I misjudged him.

914
01:06:08,665 --> 01:06:10,736
It's a good thing.
He's coming right to us.

915
01:06:10,900 --> 01:06:14,313
- I didn't wanna have to do this.
- Heh, didn't--

916
01:06:14,471 --> 01:06:17,748
You have any idea
who you're fucking with, huh?

917
01:06:17,907 --> 01:06:20,444
I read your rap sheet--
all the things you've done,

918
01:06:20,610 --> 01:06:22,317
all the people
you've done them to.

919
01:06:22,479 --> 01:06:24,686
It's gonna make this part
a little bit easier.

920
01:06:24,848 --> 01:06:26,384
Let me the fuck up outta here!

921
01:06:26,583 --> 01:06:29,860
I guess you didn't do your job.
I guess I will.

922
01:06:31,020 --> 01:06:32,863
I'm gonna hunt him down.

923
01:06:33,022 --> 01:06:34,467
How will you hunt him down?

924
01:06:34,624 --> 01:06:36,331
Stake out his house?
He doesn't live anywhere.

925
01:06:36,493 --> 01:06:38,336
Storm his office?

926
01:06:38,495 --> 01:06:41,203
He doesn't work anywhere.
You have no point of access.

927
01:06:41,364 --> 01:06:43,139
I'm gonna take your fingers off.

928
01:06:43,299 --> 01:06:45,074
You ain't got the balls.

929
01:06:46,936 --> 01:06:49,041
Love will make you do
some fucked up things.

930
01:06:49,205 --> 01:06:51,151
Fuck!

931
01:06:55,778 --> 01:06:58,691
Look, I just wanna
know one thing.

932
01:06:58,848 --> 01:07:00,953
Are you gonna earn your money?

933
01:07:02,218 --> 01:07:04,095
Jeremy is a ghost, but so am I.

934
01:07:04,254 --> 01:07:06,029
- Just tell me!
- Fuck you!

935
01:07:06,189 --> 01:07:07,395
She's gonna die slow!

936
01:07:07,557 --> 01:07:10,231
God, no!
God damn it!

937
01:07:12,729 --> 01:07:14,003
I'll fucking tell you!

938
01:07:14,163 --> 01:07:16,268
I'll find him.
Until then...

939
01:07:17,634 --> 01:07:19,170
I'd watch your back.

940
01:07:21,838 --> 01:07:23,977
- Fucking talk!
- Gathers.

941
01:07:24,107 --> 01:07:26,053
Gethers keeps the list.

942
01:07:26,209 --> 01:07:28,917
You get to Gethers and that's how
you get to fuckin' Hagan.

943
01:07:29,078 --> 01:07:32,287
Now out me the fuck lose, man!
I told you what you wanted to know.

944
01:07:32,448 --> 01:07:35,429
- Blood out, motherfucker.
- No.

945
01:07:40,256 --> 01:07:41,997
Mike Cella.

946
01:07:42,125 --> 01:07:43,604
This is Talia Durham.

947
01:07:43,760 --> 01:07:45,603
I just got your email.
Can you talk?

948
01:07:45,762 --> 01:07:48,106
You bet. I'm just trying
to figure out a gang war.

949
01:07:48,264 --> 01:07:50,608
It doesn't look like
either side started it.

950
01:07:50,767 --> 01:07:53,543
Do you have any evidence
that's leading you in another direction?

951
01:07:57,106 --> 01:07:58,483
Marshal,

952
01:07:58,675 --> 01:08:00,712
we should be careful what
we talk about on the phone.

953
01:08:00,877 --> 01:08:03,084
- Have you told anyone?
- No.

954
01:08:03,246 --> 01:08:06,557
Jeremy told me what happened
to your partner. I'm sorry.

955
01:08:08,718 --> 01:08:10,288
Listen,

956
01:08:10,453 --> 01:08:12,455
I want him dead and buried
as much as you do,

957
01:08:12,622 --> 01:08:14,898
but I'm still a cop.
You understand that?

958
01:08:15,058 --> 01:08:16,969
I came to stop
what's happening.

959
01:08:17,126 --> 01:08:19,936
- You can stop it, Marshal?
- As soon as I can find him, yeah.

960
01:08:21,130 --> 01:08:23,041
You have until 6:00.

961
01:08:23,166 --> 01:08:26,409
After that he goes out
on NCIC. as a suspect.

962
01:08:26,569 --> 01:08:28,981
Thanks, Lieutenant.

963
01:08:30,506 --> 01:08:33,146
Detective Cella.
I just got off with CSU.

964
01:08:33,309 --> 01:08:35,186
They found more blood
in the alley from the other night,

965
01:08:35,345 --> 01:08:37,154
might be from one
of our perps, but--

966
01:08:37,313 --> 01:08:39,315
But you didn't get
a match from CODIS.

967
01:08:39,482 --> 01:08:41,826
Yeah, that's right.

968
01:08:41,985 --> 01:08:43,055
Keep trying-

969
01:08:43,186 --> 01:08:45,132
Call me if you get something.

970
01:10:12,608 --> 01:10:13,848
Hey!

971
01:10:14,010 --> 01:10:16,547
Mr. Coleman,
just stay right there, don't move.

972
01:10:23,820 --> 01:10:26,164
I'm just guessing,
but I think the fire department

973
01:10:26,289 --> 01:10:28,360
is probably not
on its way, yeah?

974
01:10:28,524 --> 01:10:30,162
I turned off the call signal.

975
01:10:30,293 --> 01:10:31,772
Ah, huh.

976
01:10:35,765 --> 01:10:38,006
You know,
I don't know who's worse--

977
01:10:38,167 --> 01:10:41,273
a man who kills a son
in front of his own father

978
01:10:42,705 --> 01:10:46,084
or a man who gets paid to make sure
he gets to kill some more.

979
01:10:46,242 --> 01:10:48,119
Just for the record,

980
01:10:48,277 --> 01:10:51,190
I never wanted to become
the man that you think I am.

981
01:10:51,314 --> 01:10:54,488
I happen to believe in this
adversarial system of justice of ours.

982
01:10:54,650 --> 01:10:57,460
I happen to believe in it
with my whole heart.

983
01:10:58,621 --> 01:11:00,567
The prosecutor
and defendant go at it,

984
01:11:00,723 --> 01:11:03,135
the best advocate wins.
It's an excellent system.

985
01:11:03,292 --> 01:11:05,772
It just leads to
a bizarre world sometimes,

986
01:11:05,928 --> 01:11:07,805
where someone like me--

987
01:11:07,964 --> 01:11:10,035
reputable and legitimate»

988
01:11:10,199 --> 01:11:11,803
finds himself fighting on behalf

989
01:11:11,968 --> 01:11:14,244
of the worst scum of the earth
like David Hagan.

990
01:11:15,972 --> 01:11:18,145
Why do you represent him?

991
01:11:18,307 --> 01:11:20,753
Why do I represent him?

992
01:11:20,910 --> 01:11:23,151
I drop a man like David Hagan,

993
01:11:23,312 --> 01:11:26,122
and he kills me,
then he kills my whole family

994
01:11:26,282 --> 01:11:29,491
and then he kills my dog
just for the heck of it!

995
01:11:31,654 --> 01:11:34,260
I didn't come here to harm you.

996
01:11:35,491 --> 01:11:38,165
I never wanted to kill anybody.

997
01:11:39,428 --> 01:11:41,635
Even Hagan.

998
01:11:41,798 --> 01:11:44,005
But I cannot let him take
the lives of the people

999
01:11:44,167 --> 01:11:46,773
that I love.
Do you understand that?

1000
01:12:05,087 --> 01:12:07,294
What are you gonna do? Huh?

1001
01:12:07,456 --> 01:12:10,665
How are you gonna get to him? He's got
a whole army around him at all times.

1002
01:12:10,827 --> 01:12:13,000
I got to you, didn't I?

1003
01:12:14,730 --> 01:12:17,336
Look, I've come this far,
I can finish this.

1004
01:12:17,500 --> 01:12:19,480
Just tell me where he's gonna be.

1005
01:12:23,806 --> 01:12:26,548
I know where he goes some nights.

1006
01:12:28,878 --> 01:12:29,879
Tonight.

1007
01:13:29,538 --> 01:13:32,747
Mmm, I bet you're wishing
you hadn't come alone.

1008
01:13:32,909 --> 01:13:34,946
That's not what I wish.

1009
01:13:37,446 --> 01:13:39,949
I'm gonna tell you
why I brought you here.

1010
01:13:41,250 --> 01:13:43,594
It's 'cause I'm confused.

1011
01:13:43,753 --> 01:13:47,633
You know, I'm wondering
why you didn't do anything

1012
01:13:49,725 --> 01:13:51,671
about those friends I lost.

1013
01:13:53,229 --> 01:13:55,140
That's one of the seven deadly sins:

1014
01:13:55,298 --> 01:13:57,278
sloth,

1015
01:13:57,433 --> 01:14:00,937
failure to utilize
your talents and gifts.

1016
01:14:01,103 --> 01:14:02,741
The news says

1017
01:14:02,905 --> 01:14:04,851
it's looking like homicide.

1018
01:14:05,041 --> 01:14:06,918
Yeah, it was homicide.

1019
01:14:07,910 --> 01:14:09,651
I just haven't gotten around to it.

1020
01:14:09,812 --> 01:14:11,587
I've been a little busy with the trial.

1021
01:14:11,747 --> 01:14:13,658
Oh.

1022
01:14:13,816 --> 01:14:15,591
Have you heard from your witness?

1023
01:14:16,585 --> 01:14:19,065
Yeah.

1024
01:14:19,221 --> 01:14:21,827
Looks like he's been a little busy too.

1025
01:14:22,858 --> 01:14:24,997
I'll tell you what:

1026
01:14:25,161 --> 01:14:28,165
we oughta skip the trial.
You'll save some time,

1027
01:14:28,331 --> 01:14:30,504
kill me.

1028
01:14:32,234 --> 01:14:34,407
Come on.
I won't blame you.

1029
01:14:34,537 --> 01:14:37,950
Every man's got his dark side.

1030
01:14:38,107 --> 01:14:40,553
Just shoot me.

1031
01:14:40,710 --> 01:14:42,815
Come on.

1032
01:14:45,181 --> 01:14:47,718
What's the matter?
Your gun broke?

1033
01:14:49,652 --> 01:14:51,996
No.

1034
01:14:52,154 --> 01:14:53,895
It works just fine.

1035
01:14:56,258 --> 01:14:58,704
Justice. You see,

1036
01:14:58,861 --> 01:15:01,899
there ain't enough of that
going around for the white man.

1037
01:15:02,898 --> 01:15:05,003
Yes.

1038
01:15:05,167 --> 01:15:08,341
Not enough of that going around
for murderers either.

1039
01:15:09,638 --> 01:15:12,209
I'm gonna kill that boy.

1040
01:15:15,211 --> 01:15:16,747
I'm gonna

1041
01:15:16,912 --> 01:15:19,552
bleed him out like a sow.

1042
01:15:21,150 --> 01:15:23,357
I lost a lot of good people.

1043
01:15:23,519 --> 01:15:26,398
And that hurts me.
It does. It really does.

1044
01:15:28,190 --> 01:15:30,761
And you know
what that's like 'cause,

1045
01:15:30,926 --> 01:15:33,668
as I recall, you--

1046
01:15:33,829 --> 01:15:36,571
you lost some good people, too,
some friends

1047
01:15:36,732 --> 01:15:38,370
I've been told.

1048
01:15:38,534 --> 01:15:40,070
Yeah.

1049
01:15:41,370 --> 01:15:43,577
Close friends.

1050
01:15:47,309 --> 01:15:49,550
You're not gonna kill anyone else.

1051
01:16:19,275 --> 01:16:21,448
Hey, cry baby.

1052
01:16:21,610 --> 01:16:24,113
Come on, get up.

1053
01:16:24,280 --> 01:16:27,056
Get up off your ass! Get up!
Get up off your ass, go!

1054
01:16:32,755 --> 01:16:35,793
As you can see, it has been
a bloody day in Long Beach.

1055
01:16:35,958 --> 01:16:39,132
A long simmering feud
between the Eastside Grips

1056
01:16:39,295 --> 01:16:42,299
and a rival white-power gang
has now exploded

1057
01:16:42,465 --> 01:16:44,445
into all-out warfare.

1058
01:16:44,600 --> 01:16:46,443
It began last night with the slaying

1059
01:16:46,602 --> 01:16:49,082
of three soldiers of Aryan crime boss

1060
01:16:49,238 --> 01:16:51,309
David Hagan,
and there have been multiple...

1061
01:16:51,474 --> 01:16:53,647
Adam, you've got
a Marshal Durham here to see you.

1062
01:16:53,809 --> 01:16:56,312
So really a horrific
bloody crime scene out here.

1063
01:16:56,479 --> 01:16:58,390
Now back to you in the studio.

1064
01:17:00,216 --> 01:17:02,924
Has anyone approached you
recently about Jeremy Coleman?

1065
01:17:03,085 --> 01:17:05,827
Look, it'd be weird if I had
heard from him, right?

1066
01:17:05,988 --> 01:17:08,662
It happens.
Witnesses get distraught,

1067
01:17:08,824 --> 01:17:11,566
they make mistakes.

1068
01:17:11,694 --> 01:17:14,265
I keep them safe from everyone,

1069
01:17:14,430 --> 01:17:16,467
including themselves.

1070
01:17:18,868 --> 01:17:21,678
You know Jeremy lost
his folks when he was young?

1071
01:17:24,440 --> 01:17:26,943
That was one of the things
he loved about this job.

1072
01:17:27,109 --> 01:17:29,146
You know, it feels like a family.

1073
01:17:29,311 --> 01:17:30,984
But I worry about him

1074
01:17:31,147 --> 01:17:34,890
because even though this
feels like a family, it's not really.

1075
01:17:35,050 --> 01:17:37,496
Now you gotta have more
in your life.

1076
01:17:39,822 --> 01:17:43,463
Look, if he--
if he did find someone

1077
01:17:43,626 --> 01:17:45,606
that he really cared about...

1078
01:17:47,363 --> 01:17:49,502
I think he would
do anything for her.

1079
01:17:50,900 --> 01:17:53,210
Things that might even
be hard to accept.

1080
01:17:55,337 --> 01:17:57,317
Where is he, Adam?

1081
01:18:00,843 --> 01:18:03,289
Look, if I do hear from him,
do you have a card or something?

1082
01:18:03,445 --> 01:18:05,391
Yeah, I do and normally
I would give you one

1083
01:18:05,548 --> 01:18:07,550
and tell you to call our field office,

1084
01:18:08,984 --> 01:18:12,056
but I'm not here officially.

1085
01:18:14,356 --> 01:18:16,893
I'm trying to keep this off the books.

1086
01:18:20,296 --> 01:18:22,503
And I have until the end of the day

1087
01:18:22,665 --> 01:18:24,941
and then no one can help him.

1088
01:18:38,080 --> 01:18:39,491
There.

1089
01:18:47,323 --> 01:18:51,066
Thank you.
Thank you.

1090
01:18:54,663 --> 01:18:56,267
Thanks so much for waiting.

1091
01:18:56,432 --> 01:18:58,343
Do you know where
the Loam Motel is?

1092
01:18:58,500 --> 01:19:00,241
You bet.

1093
01:19:15,784 --> 01:19:17,627
Talia.

1094
01:19:20,889 --> 01:19:22,835
You wrote this in case you died.

1095
01:19:22,992 --> 01:19:26,735
And when I read it,
I thought you already had.

1096
01:19:26,895 --> 01:19:29,774
So now I know exactly
how it feels!

1097
01:19:29,932 --> 01:19:33,141
- Look, I had to do this.
- Now you have to stop.

1098
01:19:34,303 --> 01:19:36,579
Hagan will never stop,
do you hear me?

1099
01:19:36,739 --> 01:19:40,016
He's never gonna stop. He's gonna
keep coming for you and for me

1100
01:19:40,175 --> 01:19:42,280
and your family.
My best friend in the world

1101
01:19:42,444 --> 01:19:44,082
is in the hospital right now.

1102
01:19:44,246 --> 01:19:45,418
Hey, look at me.

1103
01:19:47,983 --> 01:19:50,156
I love you.

1104
01:19:53,589 --> 01:19:56,160
And this is what it's gonna take for us
to be together, do you hear me?

1105
01:19:56,325 --> 01:19:57,998
Yes.

1106
01:19:58,160 --> 01:20:00,663
I've had to do some awful things
the last couple of days,

1107
01:20:00,829 --> 01:20:02,831
but you're worth it.

1108
01:20:04,800 --> 01:20:06,177
Do you understand me?

1109
01:20:06,335 --> 01:20:08,576
The police know that it's you!

1110
01:20:13,108 --> 01:20:15,019
Lieutenant Cella, he figured it out.

1111
01:20:15,177 --> 01:20:17,783
And if I don't get you out
of Long Beach by 6:00 p.m.,

1112
01:20:17,946 --> 01:20:19,983
he's gonna put your face
on the wire.

1113
01:20:22,618 --> 01:20:24,359
Look, I let you in.

1114
01:20:24,520 --> 01:20:26,363
I can't go back to no one.

1115
01:20:27,356 --> 01:20:29,131
We can have a life together, but--

1116
01:20:29,291 --> 01:20:31,032
- I can finish this.
- No.

1117
01:20:31,193 --> 01:20:33,764
- Just let me finish this.
- This isn't you.

1118
01:20:33,896 --> 01:20:36,467
Please, tell me this isn't you.

1119
01:20:38,867 --> 01:20:40,710
Leave with me.

1120
01:20:41,804 --> 01:20:43,715
Please.

1121
01:20:54,450 --> 01:20:55,929
What what what what?

1122
01:21:00,356 --> 01:21:02,734
Oh my God,
what did you do?

1123
01:21:06,528 --> 01:21:10,101
Stay here, okay? Just stay
right here, I'll be right back.

1124
01:21:24,847 --> 01:21:27,293
No no no no! Jeremy!

1125
01:21:27,483 --> 01:21:28,962
Jeremy!

1126
01:21:30,252 --> 01:21:32,232
Think!

1127
01:21:46,435 --> 01:21:47,436
Cella.

1128
01:21:47,603 --> 01:21:49,048
It's quitting time.
You should go home.

1129
01:21:51,874 --> 01:21:53,911
You really think so, Jeremy?

1130
01:21:54,076 --> 01:21:56,147
You think it's quitting time?

1131
01:21:56,311 --> 01:21:58,518
Look, just one more night.

1132
01:21:58,680 --> 01:22:00,557
All right?
Let it play out.

1133
01:22:03,619 --> 01:22:05,963
Kid, you left a fingerprint.

1134
01:22:12,628 --> 01:22:15,700
Lieutenant, if I don't finish this,
she'll never be safe.

1135
01:22:15,864 --> 01:22:18,640
They found a fingerprint.

1136
01:22:18,801 --> 01:22:21,008
Do you understand
what that means?

1137
01:22:21,170 --> 01:22:24,117
That means they're gonna find
more forensic evidence.

1138
01:22:24,273 --> 01:22:26,184
They're gonna put you away.

1139
01:22:26,341 --> 01:22:28,582
You can't do this by yourself.

1140
01:22:28,744 --> 01:22:30,485
Yes, I can.

1141
01:22:30,646 --> 01:22:32,887
I have no choice.
What the hell am I supposed to do?

1142
01:22:33,015 --> 01:22:34,824
Just let it happen?

1143
01:22:34,983 --> 01:22:37,361
You've reached the voice-mail
for Lieutenant Michael Cella,

1144
01:22:37,553 --> 01:22:39,032
Gang and Narcotics Division.

1145
01:22:39,188 --> 01:22:41,031
Please leave a message
after the tone.

1146
01:22:41,190 --> 01:22:42,931
Hey, I'm coming to you.

1147
01:22:43,091 --> 01:22:45,093
I'll be at your office as soon
as I can find a cab--

1148
01:22:50,732 --> 01:22:52,803
You do what you have to do,
but tonight David Hagan

1149
01:22:52,968 --> 01:22:54,914
is going in the ground.

1150
01:22:55,037 --> 01:22:56,846
Wait! Wait!

1151
01:23:04,146 --> 01:23:05,454
I'm over here.

1152
01:23:17,993 --> 01:23:19,666
Where is he, huh?
Where is he?

1153
01:24:39,141 --> 01:24:40,142
Yeah?

1154
01:24:40,309 --> 01:24:43,051
David Hagan, current location

1155
01:24:43,211 --> 01:24:45,088
1124 Oxholm Street.

1156
01:24:45,247 --> 01:24:47,284
Hey, do me a favor
and leave your phone on.

1157
01:24:47,449 --> 01:24:48,894
- I wanna hear this.
- Jeremy?

1158
01:24:49,051 --> 01:24:50,052
Jeremy!

1159
01:24:51,887 --> 01:24:54,925
Listen, boy, you should not want
what you cannot have.

1160
01:24:57,392 --> 01:24:59,065
Oh shit!

1161
01:25:00,862 --> 01:25:02,432
Oh shit!

1162
01:26:31,520 --> 01:26:33,796
Jeremy!

1163
01:26:34,956 --> 01:26:36,060
I'm in here!

1164
01:26:37,059 --> 01:26:38,060
I'm in here! Damn it!

1165
01:26:39,227 --> 01:26:40,501
Talia!

1166
01:26:43,598 --> 01:26:45,578
Talia!

1167
01:26:45,734 --> 01:26:47,372
No!

1168
01:27:58,974 --> 01:28:00,976
Jeremy!

1169
01:28:01,143 --> 01:28:03,316
Talia!

1170
01:28:10,485 --> 01:28:12,328
We gotta get out of here.

1171
01:28:13,321 --> 01:28:14,698
Okay, come on!

1172
01:28:14,890 --> 01:28:17,302
Stay with me.
Okay, come on.

1173
01:28:23,999 --> 01:28:26,479
Come on, stay low! Stay low!

1174
01:28:38,313 --> 01:28:40,520
Okay, come on. Let's go.

1175
01:28:40,682 --> 01:28:43,458
Stay with me.
Come on, let's go.

1176
01:28:43,618 --> 01:28:45,291
Let's go.
Let's keep moving.

1177
01:28:46,321 --> 01:28:47,800
Jeremy!

1178
01:28:50,725 --> 01:28:52,705
Jeremy!

1179
01:29:34,502 --> 01:29:35,845
Come here, boy!

1180
01:30:02,797 --> 01:30:04,708
I'm over here!

1181
01:30:18,246 --> 01:30:19,919
Almost, boy.

1182
01:30:23,351 --> 01:30:24,591
Almost.

1183
01:30:25,787 --> 01:30:28,461
You were almost
strong enough to pull it off.

1184
01:30:28,623 --> 01:30:31,399
But your girlfriend Talia,
she's gonna die.

1185
01:30:31,559 --> 01:30:33,505
Die, boy!

1186
01:30:34,896 --> 01:30:38,434
You know what I think?

1187
01:30:38,600 --> 01:30:40,807
I think you just didn't
love her enough.

1188
01:30:40,969 --> 01:30:42,642
No.

1189
01:31:06,695 --> 01:31:08,333
Son of a bitch!

1190
01:31:08,496 --> 01:31:10,339
Die, boy!

1191
01:31:32,520 --> 01:31:34,466
He's gone. Come on.

1192
01:31:34,622 --> 01:31:37,034
- Let's go, let's go.
- Yeah.

1193
01:32:07,389 --> 01:32:09,733
I need you to trust me.

1194
01:32:12,894 --> 01:32:16,068
Do everything that I ask
and I promise we'll survive this.

1195
01:32:17,365 --> 01:32:18,673
Do you trust me?

1196
01:32:20,301 --> 01:32:21,336
Yeah.

1197
01:32:54,969 --> 01:32:57,347
Did they find anything
at all in that building?

1198
01:32:57,505 --> 01:32:59,951
The entire building was torched.

1199
01:33:00,108 --> 01:33:02,281
Nothing useful.

1200
01:33:16,791 --> 01:33:20,466
- I'll see you tomorrow.
- I'll see you tomorrow.
