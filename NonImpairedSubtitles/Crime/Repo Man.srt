1
00:03:24,514 --> 00:03:26,599
Let me see your driver's license.

2
00:03:31,146 --> 00:03:32,813
From out of town?

3
00:03:33,525 --> 00:03:40,074
What you got in the trunk?
- You don't want to look in there.

4
00:03:43,870 --> 00:03:45,663
Give me the keys!

5
00:04:52,115 --> 00:04:56,246
Kevin, stop singing.
- I wasn't singing.

6
00:04:57,206 --> 00:05:00,377
I'm right next to you,
and you're singing. Cut it out!

7
00:05:02,171 --> 00:05:05,257
Why so tense?
- Otto! - Mr. Humphries!

8
00:05:05,715 --> 00:05:10,136
You were late again this morning.
Normally, I'd let it go,

9
00:05:10,554 --> 00:05:15,268
but it's been brought to my attention,
you're not stacking cans properly.

10
00:05:16,185 --> 00:05:19,651
Many young men of your age,
in these uncertain times...

11
00:05:20,734 --> 00:05:24,028
Otto! Are you paying attention?

12
00:05:25,780 --> 00:05:28,242
He's talking to you!

13
00:05:30,245 --> 00:05:31,369
Fuck you!

14
00:05:39,462 --> 00:05:41,464
Good Lord!

15
00:05:41,882 --> 00:05:43,926
Come on, just try it!

16
00:05:45,010 --> 00:05:48,850
Come on! - You gotta love
getting fired in a big way, Otto!

17
00:05:49,266 --> 00:05:50,977
What are you laughing at?

18
00:05:51,436 --> 00:05:54,398
Louie, throw him out too.
- Come on, you worm!

19
00:05:54,815 --> 00:05:56,191
Get out of here!

20
00:06:18,176 --> 00:06:22,263
How you doing, dude?
When did you get out of the slammer?

21
00:06:29,980 --> 00:06:32,817
Excuse me while
I fold my pants.

22
00:06:35,278 --> 00:06:37,406
What's the difference?

23
00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:03,480
Otto! - What?
- Get me another beer.

24
00:07:10,904 --> 00:07:15,200
Cool. Ow, dammit. A joke's a joke,
but I'm supposed to be the host!

25
00:07:20,456 --> 00:07:22,917
Debbi, honey, I got your beer.

26
00:07:27,257 --> 00:07:28,300
Shit.

27
00:07:30,260 --> 00:07:34,181
Just ignore him, Duke,
he's just a big baby.

28
00:07:36,393 --> 00:07:40,438
Turn the light out!
Hey, this is my parents' room!

29
00:07:42,065 --> 00:07:44,901
Don't wanna talk about anything else.

30
00:07:47,696 --> 00:07:50,158
We don't wanna know.

31
00:07:54,789 --> 00:07:57,710
We're just dedicated

32
00:07:58,668 --> 00:08:00,961
to our favorite shows:

33
00:08:02,422 --> 00:08:04,758
"Saturday Night Live",

34
00:08:05,175 --> 00:08:07,011
"Monday Night Football",

35
00:08:08,179 --> 00:08:10,598
"Dallas", "Jeffersons",

36
00:08:11,057 --> 00:08:13,894
Gilligan's Island,
"Flintstones".

37
00:08:38,130 --> 00:08:39,800
Hey kid! Hey!

38
00:08:43,636 --> 00:08:48,019
Are you hard of hearing? - What?
- You want to make 10 bucks?

39
00:08:48,434 --> 00:08:51,938
Fuck you, queer!
- Wait, you got the wrong idea!

40
00:08:52,356 --> 00:08:55,776
My old lady is real sick.
I got to get her to the hospital, DK?

41
00:08:56,193 --> 00:08:59,739
So what? Take her there.
- I can't leave her car in this area.

42
00:09:00,156 --> 00:09:03,117
I need some helpful soul
to drive it for me.

43
00:09:03,535 --> 00:09:07,748
She's pregnant. Twins!
She could drop at any time.

44
00:09:08,623 --> 00:09:13,924
How much do I get? - 15 bucks.
- Won't do it for less than 20.

45
00:09:14,340 --> 00:09:16,051
25.

46
00:09:17,344 --> 00:09:21,766
Follow me in my old lady's car.
It's right here. - All right.

47
00:09:22,182 --> 00:09:27,939
Where is your old lady? - Never mind,
let's get out of this bad area.

48
00:09:28,939 --> 00:09:29,940
Come on!

49
00:09:38,410 --> 00:09:41,664
Dad, come quick,
a gringo's messing with your car!

50
00:10:02,396 --> 00:10:03,815
Let's go!

51
00:10:10,614 --> 00:10:13,952
Son of a bitch!
Give me my car back!

52
00:10:17,538 --> 00:10:19,666
Bastard, I'll kill you!

53
00:11:17,108 --> 00:11:20,404
You know damn straight what I mean.
It's right outside.

54
00:11:20,822 --> 00:11:24,617
Took me two weeks to get this money.
- That ain't your car.

55
00:11:25,035 --> 00:11:28,955
Don't let him lie to you.
- Shut up!

56
00:11:29,372 --> 00:11:32,753
Do I have to go to your house and
shove your dog's head down the toilet?

57
00:11:33,169 --> 00:11:36,089
Take it easy, sonnyboy.
- Shut up, rent-a-cop!

58
00:11:36,506 --> 00:11:40,718
Best goddamned car on the lot.
- Damn right it is.

59
00:11:53,652 --> 00:11:56,696
What's happening, mama, want a lift?
- No thanks.

60
00:11:57,155 --> 00:12:00,534
With no Cadillac, you sleep in a tent.
- Shut up, Plettschner.

61
00:12:00,952 --> 00:12:03,202
Bud, what street was that car on?

62
00:12:03,620 --> 00:12:08,168
I don't know, some alley. Hey kid,
what street was the Cutlass on?

63
00:12:08,837 --> 00:12:12,090
I don't know.
What happened to your old lady?

64
00:12:12,508 --> 00:12:17,513
Old lady? Shit!
I forgot all about her.

65
00:12:18,013 --> 00:12:20,140
She'll take the bus. She's a rock.

66
00:12:20,976 --> 00:12:22,727
Come on in.

67
00:12:24,563 --> 00:12:25,606
Marlene!

68
00:12:30,234 --> 00:12:31,236
Got a name, kid?

69
00:12:32,154 --> 00:12:33,990
It's Otto.

70
00:12:34,408 --> 00:12:36,576
Auto parts?

71
00:12:38,079 --> 00:12:39,665
Here, kid!

72
00:12:42,208 --> 00:12:43,251
"Helping Hand".

73
00:12:43,669 --> 00:12:46,589
Got a driver's license, honey?
Let me see it.

74
00:12:49,341 --> 00:12:52,594
Guess who told us where it was?
Your damned brother!

75
00:12:54,472 --> 00:12:58,518
Are you really 21?
- Isn't that what it says?

76
00:12:58,936 --> 00:13:00,606
Want some help with that beer, kid?

77
00:13:01,857 --> 00:13:04,527
You're all repo men!
- What if we are?

78
00:13:16,957 --> 00:13:22,170
You know, kid, usually when
someone pulls shit like that,

79
00:13:22,629 --> 00:13:25,926
my first reaction
is to punch his fucking lights out.

80
00:13:26,969 --> 00:13:28,722
But you know what?

81
00:13:29,306 --> 00:13:31,141
You're all right!

82
00:13:32,352 --> 00:13:36,814
Right, Lite? - Got any messages
for me, baby? - Here you go.

83
00:13:37,731 --> 00:13:38,774
Cracks me up.

84
00:13:39,358 --> 00:13:41,945
Somebody piss on the floor again?
- Maybe he's looking for a job.

85
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:46,409
Could be. What do you say, kid?
We're always looking for good men.

86
00:13:46,824 --> 00:13:50,203
Screw that!
I ain't gonna be a repo man. No way!

87
00:13:50,623 --> 00:13:53,043
Too late! You already are.

88
00:14:12,688 --> 00:14:15,149
You find one in every car.

89
00:14:16,235 --> 00:14:18,363
You'll see.

90
00:14:23,244 --> 00:14:27,916
Years ago I saw five cows mutilated.
Legs sticking up in the air.

91
00:14:29,167 --> 00:14:31,461
Their testicles were gone.

92
00:14:31,878 --> 00:14:34,757
I think Canadian bacon
is better myself.

93
00:14:37,175 --> 00:14:39,470
I've never seen the likes of that.

94
00:14:46,771 --> 00:14:48,981
What could've done that to him?

95
00:14:49,857 --> 00:14:51,652
Gasoline?

96
00:14:53,403 --> 00:14:56,407
Napalm?
- It happens sometimes.

97
00:14:56,824 --> 00:15:01,163
People just explode.
Natural causes. - What?

98
00:15:17,349 --> 00:15:21,019
SUSPECT PRESENCE
DN WESTCDAST CDNFIRMED.

99
00:15:21,437 --> 00:15:23,396
LDCATE IMMEDIATLY, ND PDLICE.

100
00:15:24,856 --> 00:15:27,067
Night watchman in Pomona.

101
00:15:27,484 --> 00:15:30,488
Asbestos worker, City of Industry.

102
00:15:31,489 --> 00:15:35,995
French-fry maker, Agoura. How absurd.
- Yeah? You think it's funny?

103
00:15:36,413 --> 00:15:42,043
There's room to move as a fry cook.
I could be manager in two years.

104
00:15:42,461 --> 00:15:45,381
King! God!

105
00:15:46,633 --> 00:15:51,972
Kevin, I had this wild dream
the other night. - I bet.

106
00:15:52,430 --> 00:15:53,974
It was you and me,

107
00:15:54,433 --> 00:16:00,232
we were working in this sleazy motel,
down in Miami, Florida.

108
00:16:01,692 --> 00:16:03,904
We were bellhops,

109
00:16:04,321 --> 00:16:09,868
and we were 65 years old. It was
so real, it was really realistic.

110
00:16:10,286 --> 00:16:12,371
Then what,
you woke up in a puddle?

111
00:16:14,122 --> 00:16:16,208
Fuck you!
- Fucking jerk!

112
00:16:16,667 --> 00:16:19,128
Where are you going, asshole?
- Away from you.

113
00:16:42,614 --> 00:16:44,824
The Lord has told me personally: Yea,

114
00:16:45,284 --> 00:16:48,078
for I walk with the Lord. Amen.

115
00:16:48,453 --> 00:16:51,626
He said: "Larry, you and your flock
shall seek the Promised Land.

116
00:16:52,043 --> 00:16:54,255
First you must destroy the twin evils

117
00:16:54,671 --> 00:16:58,884
of godless communism abroad and
liberal humanism at home. Dh joy. "

118
00:16:59,301 --> 00:17:03,013
Hello mother! Hello father!
Anything to eat?

119
00:17:04,390 --> 00:17:06,434
Occasionally a viewer writes to us:

120
00:17:06,849 --> 00:17:12,857
"The only reason Reverend Larry is
on TV is because he wants your money. "

121
00:17:13,275 --> 00:17:18,408
You know what? They're right. I want
your money, because God wants it.

122
00:17:18,823 --> 00:17:23,036
So go out and
mortgage that home, and sell that car,

123
00:17:23,454 --> 00:17:26,790
and send me your money.
You don't need that car...

124
00:17:27,208 --> 00:17:30,212
Put it on a plate, son.
You'll enjoy it more.

125
00:17:30,630 --> 00:17:33,841
I couldn't enjoy it any more, Mom.

126
00:17:34,299 --> 00:17:36,219
This is swell!

127
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:43,811
Hey Dad...
- What is it, son?

128
00:17:44,478 --> 00:17:49,067
Remember when you told me,
a long time ago...

129
00:17:49,526 --> 00:17:51,987
well not too long ago...

130
00:17:52,446 --> 00:17:57,076
that you'd give me 1000 dollars
to go to Europe, if I finished school?

131
00:17:57,618 --> 00:17:59,579
You were right,

132
00:17:59,996 --> 00:18:03,166
about finishing school.
That's what I'd like to do.

133
00:18:03,584 --> 00:18:08,674
But I want to know if I could
have the money first. Like now?

134
00:18:10,175 --> 00:18:12,178
I've always loved you, Dad.

135
00:18:12,971 --> 00:18:15,891
You too, Mom. What do you say?

136
00:18:16,307 --> 00:18:18,142
I don't have it anymore.

137
00:18:20,939 --> 00:18:25,985
What? - Your father gave all
our extra money to the Reverend.

138
00:18:27,236 --> 00:18:30,282
We're sending bibles to El Salvador.

139
00:18:36,249 --> 00:18:42,171
And me? - You're on the honor roll
of "Chariots of Fire". Same as us.

140
00:18:42,714 --> 00:18:45,676
It was a gift. From all of us.

141
00:18:50,138 --> 00:18:55,102
So how much do I get paid? 25 bucks
a car? - Paid? You don't get paid.

142
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:58,941
You work on commission,
that's much better.

143
00:18:59,358 --> 00:19:02,237
Most cars are worth 200- 300 dollars.

144
00:19:02,654 --> 00:19:05,991
A 50,000 dollar Porsche
might make you five grand.

145
00:19:06,408 --> 00:19:08,451
Come on, dickhead!

146
00:19:11,413 --> 00:19:14,376
It helps if you
dress like a detective.

147
00:19:16,252 --> 00:19:18,797
Detectives dress kind of square.

148
00:19:20,591 --> 00:19:25,013
If people think you're a cop,
they think you're packing something.

149
00:19:26,682 --> 00:19:28,685
Then they won't fuck with you.

150
00:19:29,101 --> 00:19:32,981
Are you? - Am I what?
- Packin' something.

151
00:19:33,439 --> 00:19:35,608
Only an asshole gets killed for a car.

152
00:19:36,026 --> 00:19:39,781
The guys who make it
get in their car at any time.

153
00:19:40,196 --> 00:19:42,950
Get in at 3 AM,
get up at 4.

154
00:19:44,619 --> 00:19:49,042
That's why there ain't a repo man
I know that don't take speed.

155
00:19:49,460 --> 00:19:50,794
Speed, huh?

156
00:19:55,466 --> 00:19:57,301
Jesus Christ!

157
00:20:00,846 --> 00:20:03,433
Never broke into a car, never
hot-wired a car.

158
00:20:03,892 --> 00:20:06,353
I never
broke into a trunk.

159
00:20:06,770 --> 00:20:09,606
I shall not cause harm to a vehicle,
or the personal contents thereof.

160
00:20:10,024 --> 00:20:15,322
Nor through inaction, let vehicle or
personal contents come to harm.

161
00:20:15,740 --> 00:20:17,867
That's what I call the repo code, kid.

162
00:20:18,284 --> 00:20:20,746
Don't forget it.
Etch it in your brain.

163
00:20:21,205 --> 00:20:24,666
Not many people
got a code to live by anymore.

164
00:20:25,084 --> 00:20:27,377
Look at those assholes over there!

165
00:20:28,838 --> 00:20:32,717
Ordinary people. I hate them.
- Me too! - What do you know?

166
00:20:33,176 --> 00:20:37,263
An ordinary person spends his life
avoiding tense situations.

167
00:20:37,681 --> 00:20:40,937
A repo man spends his life
getting into tense situations.

168
00:20:43,147 --> 00:20:44,898
Let's go get a drink.

169
00:20:45,315 --> 00:20:47,485
Get into 5 or 6 tense situations a day

170
00:20:47,903 --> 00:20:52,407
and it don't mean shit. I've seen
men stabbed, guns... don't mean shit!

171
00:20:52,866 --> 00:20:57,247
That's when you got to watch yourself.
I'll handle it, pal, settle down.

172
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:04,462
Have a nice day, or night.
Day, night, it doesn't mean shit.

173
00:21:10,596 --> 00:21:13,683
Wasn't that Otto?
- Otto who?

174
00:21:47,513 --> 00:21:50,266
There'll be some
bad shit coming down one day.

175
00:21:50,684 --> 00:21:54,896
Yeah, and where will you be?
On the moon?

176
00:21:56,400 --> 00:22:00,195
I'm going to be right here,
heading north at 110 per.

177
00:22:00,613 --> 00:22:01,615
In this junker?

178
00:22:11,458 --> 00:22:12,499
Cool car!

179
00:22:14,461 --> 00:22:15,837
The Rodriguez Brothers!

180
00:22:16,295 --> 00:22:19,967
Motherfucker just flipped you off!
- Roll the window down!

181
00:22:20,427 --> 00:22:24,182
Where you going, asshole?
- To fuck your wife!

182
00:22:24,766 --> 00:22:28,103
Watch it, motherfucker!
- Fuck you, pussy punk!

183
00:22:28,561 --> 00:22:30,062
Holy shit!

184
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:32,024
Want me to take them?

185
00:22:40,908 --> 00:22:43,036
That was cool!

186
00:23:01,725 --> 00:23:06,354
God damned dipshit Rodriguez
gypsy dildo punks!

187
00:23:06,854 --> 00:23:08,983
I'll get your asses!

188
00:23:10,693 --> 00:23:14,449
That was intense!
- A repo man's always intense.

189
00:23:14,867 --> 00:23:17,327
Come on, let's go get a drink!

190
00:23:17,785 --> 00:23:20,997
Gee Bud, you never told me
it was going to be like this.

191
00:23:21,415 --> 00:23:23,459
Cops and robbers!

192
00:23:23,876 --> 00:23:25,921
Real live car chases!

193
00:23:43,776 --> 00:23:46,862
Debbi! - If you say our names,
we'll have to kill them, Archie.

194
00:23:47,279 --> 00:23:50,449
They all ran away!
- Come on, douche bags!

195
00:24:05,635 --> 00:24:07,719
Awful quiet in here.

196
00:24:09,055 --> 00:24:10,514
Too quiet.

197
00:24:12,392 --> 00:24:14,560
Who are these Rodriguez Boys?

198
00:24:14,976 --> 00:24:18,398
Rodriguez Brothers.
Lagarto and Napoleon.

199
00:24:18,857 --> 00:24:23,362
Notorious delinquents, responsible for
at least 30 vehicles in the field.

200
00:24:23,779 --> 00:24:29,704
Scumbags! - They ain't scumbags,
they're car thieves, just like us.

201
00:24:31,246 --> 00:24:34,418
There's Mrs. Magruder.
You want to go for it?

202
00:24:37,588 --> 00:24:40,340
Good gag. You pull this one a lot?

203
00:24:40,966 --> 00:24:44,053
Only on women. Never fails.

204
00:24:47,139 --> 00:24:50,143
Excuse me, Mrs. Magruder?

205
00:24:51,228 --> 00:24:53,187
I have something for you.

206
00:24:57,069 --> 00:24:58,653
How charming!

207
00:25:04,827 --> 00:25:06,620
Motherfucker!

208
00:25:10,585 --> 00:25:12,420
Lite, where are you?

209
00:25:21,597 --> 00:25:26,395
Ruthside Peason, brokerage consultant.
Millionaire, 6 payments behind.

210
00:25:27,312 --> 00:25:29,356
I've never understood it.
- What?

211
00:25:29,815 --> 00:25:33,444
Millionaires never pay their bills.
See you at the yard.

212
00:25:33,902 --> 00:25:38,450
Let me get this one. - No, I'll do it.
Mr. Peason has a permit for a pistol.

213
00:25:39,576 --> 00:25:42,996
Hey! Give me that!
- Don't underestimate me, ace.

214
00:25:51,590 --> 00:25:55,053
Also, I would like
them to be close to the window,

215
00:25:55,469 --> 00:25:58,682
so I can sit in my car
and watch them spin.

216
00:25:59,100 --> 00:26:03,187
So all you have to do is
take your clothes out, and

217
00:26:03,604 --> 00:26:05,857
put them in the machine over there.

218
00:26:09,068 --> 00:26:10,487
Dh my god!

219
00:26:11,741 --> 00:26:14,117
Dh my god! Stop!

220
00:26:26,589 --> 00:26:28,717
Hey! Do you need a ride?

221
00:26:29,510 --> 00:26:31,261
Hey, baby, need a ride?

222
00:26:38,145 --> 00:26:40,148
Pick it up!

223
00:26:44,987 --> 00:26:49,867
Pick it up! You know yourself
that you were wrong.

224
00:26:50,285 --> 00:26:53,706
Why were they in the middle
of the street? - They weren't.

225
00:26:54,121 --> 00:26:57,959
That's not the middle of the street,
that's the corner.

226
00:27:00,003 --> 00:27:04,300
Go on, you pick it up.
- What? - You pick it up!

227
00:27:04,718 --> 00:27:09,557
No way! You still want a ride?
- No I don't.

228
00:27:20,151 --> 00:27:21,736
My name's Otto.
- Leila.

229
00:27:22,612 --> 00:27:25,701
Is this your car?
- It's one of them.

230
00:27:26,117 --> 00:27:30,499
One of them? You think you're
pretty slick, don't you?

231
00:27:30,957 --> 00:27:33,168
I'll bet you're
a used car salesman.

232
00:27:33,585 --> 00:27:36,672
I am not.
- You dress like one.

233
00:27:37,089 --> 00:27:40,133
I'm a repo man.
- What's that?

234
00:27:41,219 --> 00:27:45,432
A repossessor. I take back cars
from dildos who don't pay their bills.

235
00:27:45,850 --> 00:27:48,101
Cool, huh?
- No.

236
00:27:50,562 --> 00:27:53,901
What are you doing? - Those men
in the car next to us, don't look!

237
00:27:54,360 --> 00:27:56,570
If they see me
they'll kill me.

238
00:27:57,739 --> 00:27:58,782
Really? Why?

239
00:28:00,450 --> 00:28:02,661
What the hell are you doing?

240
00:28:03,329 --> 00:28:06,248
What's going on?
- Take a look at this.

241
00:28:11,712 --> 00:28:13,756
Looks like sausage.

242
00:28:14,173 --> 00:28:19,098
It isn't sausage, Otto.
That's a picture of 4 dead aliens.

243
00:28:22,477 --> 00:28:28,649
Laugh away! It'll be on the cover
of every major paper in two days.

244
00:28:29,109 --> 00:28:31,359
How do you know?
- I'm part of a secret network.

245
00:28:31,820 --> 00:28:36,742
A scientist in our secret sect
smuggled the corpses off an army base.

246
00:28:37,202 --> 00:28:41,413
Now he's got them in
the trunk of his car, a Chevy Malibu.

247
00:28:41,830 --> 00:28:43,958
We've got to find him.

248
00:28:44,417 --> 00:28:47,130
What will you do with them,
put them on "Johnny Carson"?

249
00:28:47,505 --> 00:28:51,676
Yes! We'll have a press conference
and tell the world.

250
00:29:02,314 --> 00:29:04,190
United Fruitcake Outlet.

251
00:29:04,608 --> 00:29:06,652
My door doesn't work.

252
00:29:14,161 --> 00:29:17,832
No matter how appealing, do not
let strange creatures into your house.

253
00:29:18,249 --> 00:29:23,130
Strange creatures are on the increase,
many seem adorable, but beware!

254
00:29:23,547 --> 00:29:25,258
We know not whence they came...

255
00:29:25,674 --> 00:29:28,887
Thanks for the ride.
- Sure.

256
00:29:32,139 --> 00:29:34,976
Do you want
to go out with me again?

257
00:29:35,393 --> 00:29:38,732
I don't know, I'm kind of busy,
with the Malibu and all.

258
00:29:41,695 --> 00:29:45,239
Great. Terrific. Here's your shit!

259
00:29:45,949 --> 00:29:50,995
What's your problem? Girls might
like you if you lightened up a bit.

260
00:29:51,453 --> 00:29:55,417
Fuck! Girls pay to go out with me.
All right?

261
00:29:57,503 --> 00:29:59,171
Wanna get back in the car?

262
00:30:03,677 --> 00:30:05,597
What, here?
- Yeah.

263
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:08,976
Fuck the seat!

264
00:30:13,605 --> 00:30:16,359
20,000 dollars for a Chevy Malibu?

265
00:30:19,278 --> 00:30:22,031
Who's "Double X Finance"?
- Storefront operation.

266
00:30:22,449 --> 00:30:24,324
But the money is in escrow.

267
00:30:27,540 --> 00:30:29,041
Want me to notify the boys?

268
00:30:29,457 --> 00:30:33,546
E.T.s WILL LAND ANY DAY NOW

269
00:30:33,963 --> 00:30:36,800
No. I think I'll go out for a while.
- Why? Are we out of beer?

270
00:30:37,216 --> 00:30:39,594
Somebody has to work around here.

271
00:30:41,597 --> 00:30:44,390
Keep making me money, kid.
- Fuck you.

272
00:30:45,141 --> 00:30:48,730
We've been after this red devil
for a long time. Just act natural.

273
00:30:49,147 --> 00:30:53,028
Nobody knows if it's your car or not.
Don't worry about that.

274
00:30:53,446 --> 00:30:56,239
You give it a try. All right?

275
00:31:01,870 --> 00:31:04,874
Better be fast if he finds us, boy.
- Got it!

276
00:31:15,386 --> 00:31:17,304
Let's get out of here.

277
00:31:24,564 --> 00:31:26,066
Dh, man!

278
00:31:33,364 --> 00:31:35,242
Put your seatbelt on, boy!

279
00:31:35,660 --> 00:31:39,414
I don't ride with anybody without
a seatbelt. It's one of my rules.

280
00:31:51,095 --> 00:31:54,765
Put that gun down, boy.
It ain't no toy. Shit!

281
00:32:00,648 --> 00:32:03,108
I walk into someone's
place of work.

282
00:32:03,526 --> 00:32:07,196
They're shit scared.
They know I'm not a cop.

283
00:32:07,613 --> 00:32:10,075
They think I've come to kill them,
and I would.

284
00:32:10,493 --> 00:32:15,582
I'd kill anybody who crosses me.
You know what I mean?

285
00:32:19,379 --> 00:32:21,714
Do you like music?
- Sure.

286
00:32:22,382 --> 00:32:24,843
Then you'll love this.

287
00:32:25,259 --> 00:32:30,014
I was into these dudes before anybody.
Partied with them all the time.

288
00:32:30,474 --> 00:32:34,854
Asked me to be their manager.
I called bullshit on that.

289
00:32:37,275 --> 00:32:41,696
Managing a pop group?
That ain't a job for no man.

290
00:32:46,617 --> 00:32:50,039
Did you read that book I gave you?
- What book?

291
00:32:50,497 --> 00:32:53,458
"Dioretix. The Science of
Matter over Mind".

292
00:32:53,876 --> 00:32:58,256
You better read it, and quick.
That book will change your life.

293
00:32:58,672 --> 00:33:02,178
Found it in a Maserati
in Beverly Hills. Know what I mean?

294
00:33:04,138 --> 00:33:06,517
Lots of people don't realize
what's really going on.

295
00:33:07,310 --> 00:33:11,523
They view life as a bunch of
unconnected incidents and things.

296
00:33:11,939 --> 00:33:14,359
They don't realize
that there's this

297
00:33:14,775 --> 00:33:17,945
lattice of coincidence
on top of everything.

298
00:33:18,405 --> 00:33:21,742
I'll give you an example
to show you what I mean:

299
00:33:23,286 --> 00:33:26,583
Suppose you're thinking about
a plate of shrimp.

300
00:33:26,999 --> 00:33:32,547
Suddenly, somebody says:
plate, or shrimp, or plate of shrimp.

301
00:33:33,590 --> 00:33:35,926
No point in looking
for an explanation.

302
00:33:36,384 --> 00:33:39,931
It's all part
of a cosmic unconsciousness.

303
00:33:40,348 --> 00:33:43,267
Did you eat a lot of acid,
back in the hippie days?

304
00:33:43,685 --> 00:33:46,020
I'll give you another instance:

305
00:33:46,438 --> 00:33:49,441
You know the way everybody's
into weirdness right now?

306
00:33:49,858 --> 00:33:53,989
Books in all the supermarkets
about Bermuda Triangles,

307
00:33:54,406 --> 00:33:59,537
UFOs, how the Mayans
invented TV, that kind of thing?

308
00:33:59,954 --> 00:34:01,664
I don't read them books.

309
00:34:02,123 --> 00:34:04,459
For me it's exactly the same.

310
00:34:04,876 --> 00:34:09,715
There's no difference between
a flying saucer and a time machine.

311
00:34:10,131 --> 00:34:15,387
People get so hung up on specifics,
they can't see the whole thing.

312
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:19,311
Take South America, for example:

313
00:34:19,727 --> 00:34:24,024
There, thousands of people
go missing each year.

314
00:34:25,275 --> 00:34:30,407
Nobody knows where they go.
They just disappear.

315
00:34:31,742 --> 00:34:37,206
But if you think about it,
you realize something:

316
00:34:38,124 --> 00:34:42,212
There had to be a time when
there was no people, right? - Yeah.

317
00:34:42,630 --> 00:34:45,591
Well, where
did all these people come from?

318
00:34:48,512 --> 00:34:50,973
I'll tell you where: the future.

319
00:34:52,266 --> 00:34:54,851
Where did all these
people disappear to?

320
00:34:55,269 --> 00:34:58,439
The past? - That's right!
And how did they get there?

321
00:34:58,855 --> 00:35:00,649
How the fuck do I know?

322
00:35:01,108 --> 00:35:03,192
Flying saucers.

323
00:35:04,654 --> 00:35:06,739
Which are really...

324
00:35:08,411 --> 00:35:11,747
yeah you got it...
... time machines.

325
00:35:15,126 --> 00:35:18,004
I think a lot about this stuff.

326
00:35:20,506 --> 00:35:24,720
I do my best thinking on the bus.
That's how come I don't drive.

327
00:35:25,137 --> 00:35:27,348
You don't even know how to drive.

328
00:35:27,765 --> 00:35:30,892
I don't want to know how.
See?

329
00:35:31,936 --> 00:35:34,022
The more you drive,

330
00:35:35,525 --> 00:35:38,029
the less intelligent you are.

331
00:35:42,741 --> 00:35:45,828
I think I saw
one of those UFOs once.

332
00:35:46,246 --> 00:35:52,293
It was really kind of scary, it was
all these colored lights and sounds.

333
00:35:52,710 --> 00:35:58,133
Sounds and lights like I've never
heard before. It was really weird.

334
00:36:00,054 --> 00:36:05,267
Bud? Do you think all repo men
follow the code?

335
00:36:05,893 --> 00:36:07,270
Of course.

336
00:36:08,604 --> 00:36:14,611
A lot of fucked up cars come in, but
mostly the customer's fucked them up.

337
00:36:15,029 --> 00:36:16,238
Assholes!

338
00:36:28,628 --> 00:36:33,467
I'll give 1000 dollars for his Falcon.
That's a bribe, Napoleon.

339
00:36:33,926 --> 00:36:36,971
Who the hell is this? "Napoleon"?
Who are you calling?

340
00:36:37,388 --> 00:36:40,766
A grand if you show me
where his car is.

341
00:36:41,184 --> 00:36:43,394
Go fuck yourself, asshole!

342
00:36:43,812 --> 00:36:44,853
Hello?

343
00:36:46,564 --> 00:36:48,109
Prick!

344
00:36:49,568 --> 00:36:53,323
64 Chevy Malibu. 20 grand.

345
00:36:53,741 --> 00:36:56,536
I'm waiting!
- We could buy 10 of them for that.

346
00:36:57,202 --> 00:37:02,208
Think you can find it now? - Why is
this junk worth so much? What's in it?

347
00:37:02,835 --> 00:37:04,212
Drugs?

348
00:37:06,255 --> 00:37:10,384
Los Hermanos Rodriguez
don't approve of drugs.

349
00:37:10,802 --> 00:37:13,012
Neither do I,
but it's my birthday.

350
00:37:15,975 --> 00:37:18,228
That motherfucker's still down there.

351
00:37:19,146 --> 00:37:23,192
I don't care how long it takes,
dildos!

352
00:37:23,610 --> 00:37:27,447
A repo man's got all night,
every night.

353
00:37:38,334 --> 00:37:41,923
Jesus Christ! 20,000 dollars!

354
00:37:46,678 --> 00:37:50,139
Hi, this is Leila.
Please leave your name,

355
00:37:50,557 --> 00:37:53,812
number, and a brief message,
and the time you called, at the beep.

356
00:37:54,228 --> 00:37:56,439
And please try to be frank.

357
00:37:56,856 --> 00:38:01,193
Hey Leila. This is Otto,
the guy who gave you the ride.

358
00:38:01,611 --> 00:38:04,531
I heard something about that car.

359
00:38:19,131 --> 00:38:23,178
Otto. Otto, stop!
You wanted to tell me something.

360
00:38:29,268 --> 00:38:31,480
What did you want to tell me?

361
00:38:32,940 --> 00:38:35,193
Take off your clothes.

362
00:38:35,986 --> 00:38:39,072
I'm at work, Otto.
- Yeah? Me too.

363
00:38:39,490 --> 00:38:42,118
Your work is different than mine.
- Says who?

364
00:38:42,534 --> 00:38:44,955
What are you doing? Don't!

365
00:38:45,873 --> 00:38:48,333
At least you could
give me a blowjob.

366
00:38:50,919 --> 00:38:52,629
I guess that means no.

367
00:38:54,631 --> 00:38:57,176
We have a
cell meeting in two minutes time.

368
00:38:58,513 --> 00:39:00,932
Thanks, Deadra. I'll be right there.

369
00:39:09,025 --> 00:39:12,528
That motherfucker thinks
I don't know what's up, Lite.

370
00:39:12,944 --> 00:39:16,074
As soon as I find that Chevy,
I'm going indy.

371
00:39:16,532 --> 00:39:20,621
I'm getting myself a tow truck,
a couple of pit bulls and a yard.

372
00:39:21,037 --> 00:39:24,460
Sit around and watch
everyone else work for a while.

373
00:39:24,918 --> 00:39:28,046
You can't do that on 20 grand.
- The hell I can't.

374
00:39:28,464 --> 00:39:32,552
As long as you have good credit,
and my credit is spotless.

375
00:39:35,721 --> 00:39:38,475
Credit is a sacred trust.

376
00:39:38,935 --> 00:39:41,603
It's what our free society
is founded on.

377
00:39:42,021 --> 00:39:45,316
Do you think they
give a damn about bills in Russia?

378
00:39:45,732 --> 00:39:49,280
I said, do you think they give a damn
about their bills in Russia?

379
00:39:49,697 --> 00:39:52,075
They don't pay bills in Russia.
It's all free.

380
00:39:52,533 --> 00:39:56,121
All free? Free my ass!
What are, you, a commie?

381
00:39:56,956 --> 00:40:01,837
I'm no commie. - You better not be!
I don't want no commies in my car.

382
00:40:02,753 --> 00:40:04,213
No Christians either!

383
00:40:26,990 --> 00:40:29,911
I'll deal with you later.
I've got a customer.

384
00:40:31,036 --> 00:40:33,163
You too.

385
00:40:34,165 --> 00:40:36,000
Hi, I'm Kevin. Vacuum, sir?

386
00:40:49,933 --> 00:40:51,894
Need a vacuum, sir?

387
00:41:13,670 --> 00:41:15,838
Want me to check the trunk?

388
00:41:16,799 --> 00:41:18,842
Excuse me?

389
00:41:25,892 --> 00:41:30,188
Hi, I'm Kevin! - Hey, don't you
remember me? I was here yesterday.

390
00:41:30,606 --> 00:41:34,612
I think I left my matches in your
office. Can you go and check for me?

391
00:41:35,070 --> 00:41:36,823
Sure thing.

392
00:41:37,241 --> 00:41:41,202
Anything for you. - You're
beautiful. - I'll be right back.

393
00:42:00,016 --> 00:42:01,058
What?

394
00:42:09,902 --> 00:42:11,697
It's very simple, Mrs. Parks.

395
00:42:12,113 --> 00:42:15,033
You don't want me to take it,
and I don't want to.

396
00:42:15,451 --> 00:42:20,580
I said to my boss: Look, I don't want
to repossess this lady's car.

397
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:25,504
I've been in the hospital, you see.
- I understand.

398
00:42:25,963 --> 00:42:29,426
But my job is really
on the line over this one.

399
00:42:30,553 --> 00:42:35,432
I'll see if I can borrow some money.
- That's terrific. Terrific.

400
00:42:40,938 --> 00:42:44,943
How was rehearsal, son?
- Okay. Who's this?

401
00:42:45,361 --> 00:42:50,034
This is Mr. Otto, deary.
From the finance company.

402
00:42:51,202 --> 00:42:54,831
He told me he isn't going to
take the car this time,

403
00:42:55,246 --> 00:42:57,541
even though he could.

404
00:43:00,836 --> 00:43:01,879
Well...

405
00:43:04,257 --> 00:43:06,468
gotta get going.

406
00:43:20,319 --> 00:43:22,780
Did you like the tea?

407
00:43:23,865 --> 00:43:25,533
The tea?

408
00:43:25,949 --> 00:43:28,369
Yeah, it was terrific.

409
00:43:30,872 --> 00:43:32,290
Thank you.
- You're welcome.

410
00:43:40,551 --> 00:43:44,680
I gave you the money last week,
and you didn't pay it.

411
00:43:45,097 --> 00:43:49,019
I'm tired of giving you money,
and you squandering it.

412
00:43:49,478 --> 00:43:52,356
You all went out dancing somewhere.

413
00:43:52,772 --> 00:43:56,861
Next time, you better put the money
on the car. You're working.

414
00:43:57,277 --> 00:44:01,323
How come you didn't do it?
What's wrong with you?

415
00:44:33,655 --> 00:44:37,784
Hey, everything's cool!
I like music too, man.

416
00:44:57,807 --> 00:45:01,187
Some people ain't cut out to be
a repo man. Why don't you smarten up?

417
00:45:01,605 --> 00:45:03,565
Fuck you, Plettschner!

418
00:45:04,023 --> 00:45:06,860
Don't say fuck to me!
Don't you know who I am?

419
00:45:07,401 --> 00:45:10,738
You're Plettschner.
- Damn right! Otto Plettschner.

420
00:45:11,198 --> 00:45:15,493
3 times decorated in 2 world wars.
I was killing people while you

421
00:45:15,911 --> 00:45:17,038
were in your dad's balls.

422
00:45:17,456 --> 00:45:20,583
Worked 5 years in a slaughterhouse
and 10 years as prison guard.

423
00:45:21,003 --> 00:45:24,589
So what? - "So what"?
Never say "fuck you" to me,

424
00:45:25,007 --> 00:45:27,718
because you haven't
earned the rights yet.

425
00:45:28,135 --> 00:45:30,887
Hey kid,
I need a contract driver.

426
00:45:31,804 --> 00:45:34,268
See what I mean, punk?

427
00:45:37,229 --> 00:45:39,689
Fuck you!
- Fuck you!

428
00:45:40,898 --> 00:45:43,151
You scumbag!
- Shut up, Plettschner.

429
00:45:43,568 --> 00:45:45,862
Don't ever tell me to shut up.

430
00:45:52,747 --> 00:45:54,875
Shit!

431
00:45:55,542 --> 00:46:00,131
It's too hot in here, man.
What the hell's going on?

432
00:46:01,297 --> 00:46:06,261
That shit in the trunk must be
melting. We better take a look.

433
00:46:10,225 --> 00:46:12,645
Get us 2 sodas.
- As soon as I check the trunk.

434
00:46:13,105 --> 00:46:16,149
We're just the mules. DK? Move it.

435
00:46:55,402 --> 00:46:58,114
"Helping Hand"
- Marlene, we found the car.

436
00:46:59,658 --> 00:47:01,577
Come on, guys!

437
00:47:06,708 --> 00:47:09,253
Get the ladder!
- Stop pushing, Duke!

438
00:47:11,296 --> 00:47:15,050
My medication! Aw man!
- Be cool, dude. We got more.

439
00:47:15,468 --> 00:47:17,513
Let me help, Archie.

440
00:47:17,929 --> 00:47:19,390
Come on!

441
00:47:30,570 --> 00:47:34,408
Well, that's not all. This car
is hot. - What, stolen?

442
00:47:34,825 --> 00:47:39,079
No, hot, really hot.
We're sweating like pigs, man.

443
00:47:39,747 --> 00:47:42,875
Where is the car from?
- Someplace...

444
00:47:43,793 --> 00:47:45,961
...Roswell, New Mexico.

445
00:48:19,753 --> 00:48:22,964
Me, fight in a war?
No way!

446
00:48:23,422 --> 00:48:27,554
Nobody's got to do that shit.
Not in this country.

447
00:48:28,179 --> 00:48:32,766
A new ID don't cost no more
than a pink slip.

448
00:48:33,809 --> 00:48:35,644
Something wrong?

449
00:48:37,980 --> 00:48:39,983
You know, that Marlene,

450
00:48:40,902 --> 00:48:43,279
she's pretty hot.

451
00:48:44,280 --> 00:48:49,246
Otto, my man, I jumped on
that action from day one.

452
00:48:49,663 --> 00:48:52,832
I found out where
she's coming from.

453
00:48:53,292 --> 00:48:56,753
See you back at the yard.
- Have fun.

454
00:49:54,905 --> 00:49:56,489
Holy shit!

455
00:49:59,201 --> 00:50:01,745
Holy fucking shit!

456
00:50:11,258 --> 00:50:13,927
Lite! Open the door!

457
00:50:14,344 --> 00:50:17,055
There's a maniac in there.
What are you doing?

458
00:50:17,514 --> 00:50:19,100
Open the door!

459
00:50:19,558 --> 00:50:22,853
What are you doing? Open the door!

460
00:50:23,272 --> 00:50:28,863
You're still on the job, white boy.
Get in the car. - Open the door, Lite!

461
00:50:30,281 --> 00:50:32,324
Get in the car!
- Jesus Christ!

462
00:50:49,051 --> 00:50:50,969
You're crazy, Lite.

463
00:50:51,428 --> 00:50:54,141
You can't just shoot into
peoples' houses.

464
00:50:54,559 --> 00:50:58,146
Maybe you shot the guy.
- So what if I did?

465
00:50:58,564 --> 00:51:01,107
I don't know.
I mean, that's pretty severe.

466
00:51:07,364 --> 00:51:08,282
Jesus Christ!

467
00:51:10,660 --> 00:51:13,203
Hey, blanks do the job too.

468
00:51:14,206 --> 00:51:18,963
You repo men are all out to lunch.
Let's get out of here.

469
00:51:28,598 --> 00:51:29,765
Hello?

470
00:51:36,816 --> 00:51:40,319
Is it you? This is Leila.
Are you using a scrambler?

471
00:51:41,780 --> 00:51:44,285
I can't hear you,
I'm using a scrambler.

472
00:51:49,790 --> 00:51:51,083
Look out!
- What?

473
00:52:08,727 --> 00:52:09,897
Happy face!

474
00:52:10,315 --> 00:52:12,858
You want a ride?

475
00:52:17,071 --> 00:52:18,282
Help!

476
00:52:18,740 --> 00:52:20,534
No!

477
00:52:23,246 --> 00:52:26,457
What do you want from me?
- We ask the questions.

478
00:52:26,875 --> 00:52:30,544
Are you going to torture me?
- Torture you? What for?

479
00:52:30,962 --> 00:52:36,220
To find out what I know.
I'd torture someone in a second.

480
00:52:37,346 --> 00:52:41,850
Why are you after the Malibu?
- Because of the aliens in the trunk.

481
00:52:42,268 --> 00:52:47,524
Illegal aliens?
- No, silly, extraterrestrials.

482
00:52:48,067 --> 00:52:51,653
Ever thought about joining the CIA?
- I have to ask my boyfriend.

483
00:52:52,070 --> 00:52:56,116
Otto Maddox, Male, White, 21...
Correction: 18.

484
00:53:00,497 --> 00:53:02,626
What's going on?
- The usual.

485
00:53:03,543 --> 00:53:05,880
Hi Marlene! How you doing, baby?

486
00:53:06,338 --> 00:53:09,424
Jesus, who done that to you?
- Who done what?

487
00:53:09,883 --> 00:53:14,431
"Who done what", he says.
Who did that to your face, kid?

488
00:53:14,848 --> 00:53:16,891
Some dude. It doesn't matter.
- Dh yes it does!

489
00:53:17,309 --> 00:53:19,352
Do something, Plettschner.
Aren't you a cop?

490
00:53:19,812 --> 00:53:21,438
I'm on my coffee break.

491
00:53:21,855 --> 00:53:25,776
Repo man don't go running
to the man. Repo man goes it alone.

492
00:53:26,236 --> 00:53:27,321
Yessireebob!

493
00:53:27,738 --> 00:53:31,536
Just like John Wayne.
- Damn right! What's wrong with that?

494
00:53:31,994 --> 00:53:36,498
Greatest American that ever lived.
- John Wayne was a fag. - What?

495
00:53:36,915 --> 00:53:39,877
What?
- John Wayne was a fag.

496
00:53:40,293 --> 00:53:42,421
The hell he was!

497
00:53:43,254 --> 00:53:45,548
He was too, boys.

498
00:53:45,966 --> 00:53:49,597
I installed 2-way mirrors
in his pad in Brentwood.

499
00:53:50,013 --> 00:53:51,975
And he came to the door in a dress.

500
00:53:52,435 --> 00:53:56,854
You're nuts. - That doesn't mean
he was a homo, Miller.

501
00:53:57,272 --> 00:54:01,527
A lot of straight guys like to watch
their buddies fuck. I know I do.

502
00:54:02,236 --> 00:54:04,822
- Don't you?
- I sure do.

503
00:54:05,240 --> 00:54:07,951
Fuck John Wayne!
Tell us his name, you little pussy!

504
00:54:08,368 --> 00:54:10,371
Piss off, ass-wipes.

505
00:54:11,580 --> 00:54:14,415
You bastards!
- Easy!

506
00:54:14,833 --> 00:54:17,002
The guy's head is hurt.

507
00:54:17,421 --> 00:54:19,756
You're taking this
too personal, son.

508
00:54:20,216 --> 00:54:23,596
The thing is, a repo man
got beat up in the line of duty.

509
00:54:24,012 --> 00:54:26,182
It doesn't matter that it was you.

510
00:54:26,598 --> 00:54:30,812
What really matters,
is that the guy pays the price.

511
00:54:31,520 --> 00:54:34,148
Now stop being selfish,
and tell us his name.

512
00:54:34,564 --> 00:54:35,649
Come on!

513
00:54:36,776 --> 00:54:38,027
Bastard!

514
00:54:38,485 --> 00:54:39,989
All right!

515
00:54:40,907 --> 00:54:42,532
DK, his name was...

516
00:54:55,674 --> 00:54:57,677
Mr. Humphries?
- Yes?

517
00:54:58,094 --> 00:55:01,347
Yes, I'm Mr. Humphries.
What do you want?

518
00:55:03,223 --> 00:55:07,019
...U.S. planes napalmed refugee camps
in southern Mexico. He explained that

519
00:55:07,437 --> 00:55:10,025
the camps were really guerrilla bases.

520
00:55:10,440 --> 00:55:13,279
In Guatemala, shots were fired
at the U.S. embassy...

521
00:55:16,408 --> 00:55:21,121
"Helping Hand", Marlene speaking.
- Hello, is Otto there?

522
00:55:21,872 --> 00:55:24,707
It's for you. A girl.

523
00:55:29,880 --> 00:55:32,007
Hi Otto? It's Leila.

524
00:55:35,138 --> 00:55:36,139
Leila who?

525
00:56:06,382 --> 00:56:08,759
Can't believe I once liked these guys.
- Listen to me!

526
00:56:09,217 --> 00:56:13,514
For the sake of future generations,
please tell us everything you know.

527
00:56:13,973 --> 00:56:16,185
Sure, I need another drink.

528
00:56:16,601 --> 00:56:20,814
These aliens aren't even on ice,
they could be starting to decay.

529
00:56:21,357 --> 00:56:23,317
We've got to find them.

530
00:56:23,735 --> 00:56:25,906
Well, well, well!

531
00:56:26,447 --> 00:56:31,704
If it ain't the repo man.
- You look like shit, wanker.

532
00:56:32,120 --> 00:56:34,414
Duke, Debbi, Archie,

533
00:56:35,915 --> 00:56:38,294
meet Leila
and her weird friend.

534
00:56:39,545 --> 00:56:41,881
How you doing, asshole?

535
00:56:42,298 --> 00:56:46,177
How come you don't hang out with
your friends anymore? - What friends?

536
00:56:48,597 --> 00:56:50,685
Want some ludes, dude?

537
00:56:55,565 --> 00:56:56,565
I really love you.

538
00:56:56,983 --> 00:57:01,404
Because you always
visited me when I was in juvie.

539
00:57:01,864 --> 00:57:03,531
I was busy. I told you I was working.

540
00:57:03,948 --> 00:57:05,533
Wow, a metal hand!

541
00:57:05,951 --> 00:57:07,203
Cool!

542
00:57:09,746 --> 00:57:11,790
Can we feel it?

543
00:57:25,891 --> 00:57:29,938
Fuck this!
Let's go do some crimes.

544
00:57:30,522 --> 00:57:32,399
Nice friends you got there, Otto

545
00:57:33,108 --> 00:57:35,235
Thanks, I made them myself.

546
00:57:45,665 --> 00:57:50,420
Hey, what the fuck are you
doing with our car? - Your car?

547
00:57:52,130 --> 00:57:56,260
Are you sure?
This looks like my car.

548
00:57:56,802 --> 00:58:00,264
Are there pecan pies in the back?
- Not any more. We ate them.

549
00:58:00,681 --> 00:58:04,520
Shut up, Archie.
- You shut up. - You're still here?

550
00:58:04,978 --> 00:58:07,483
My car looks just like this.

551
00:58:07,901 --> 00:58:10,652
But this is yours, your car?

552
00:58:11,112 --> 00:58:13,740
Yeah, 4 eyes.
- Of course...

553
00:58:14,823 --> 00:58:17,494
What's in the trunk?
- What do you mean?

554
00:58:17,909 --> 00:58:21,915
You don't even know what's in
your own trunk. You know what?

555
00:58:22,333 --> 00:58:24,751
I think you're afraid to find out.

556
00:58:25,169 --> 00:58:26,337
Kill him!

557
00:58:26,754 --> 00:58:30,883
I ain't afraid of nothing, see?
- I don't blame you for being afraid.

558
00:58:31,301 --> 00:58:35,347
I said, I ain't afraid of nothing.
I kill people like you.

559
00:58:35,765 --> 00:58:37,976
Dh well, I guess you're right.

560
00:58:40,437 --> 00:58:42,940
It's better not to look.

561
00:58:44,025 --> 00:58:47,819
Beautiful evening.
You can almost see the stars.

562
00:58:48,404 --> 00:58:50,490
Dh shut up!

563
00:58:51,115 --> 00:58:53,201
He's going to open it.

564
00:58:55,370 --> 00:58:57,747
Come on, Duke!
- The thing is hot!

565
00:59:01,713 --> 00:59:03,714
Look, we don't have all night.

566
00:59:15,770 --> 00:59:18,189
Close it, Duke! No!

567
00:59:21,817 --> 00:59:24,447
Dukie Wookie
hurt his wittle hand.

568
00:59:24,865 --> 00:59:25,906
Fuck you, Archie!

569
00:59:26,324 --> 00:59:29,745
Just for that, you're not in the gang.
- I'm taking over now.

570
00:59:30,163 --> 00:59:32,123
Dh, leave it!
- King Archie!

571
00:59:32,582 --> 00:59:34,501
The Invincible!
- Shut up, Archie!

572
00:59:37,545 --> 00:59:38,671
Watch this!

573
00:59:43,802 --> 00:59:44,803
Dh dear!

574
00:59:45,346 --> 00:59:49,142
What a shame! - Come on,
Duke, let's go do those crimes.

575
00:59:52,689 --> 00:59:56,818
Yeah. Let's get sushi...
and not pay.

576
01:00:13,711 --> 01:00:14,881
Hey buddy!

577
01:00:16,717 --> 01:00:18,385
Special deputies, pull over!

578
01:00:18,760 --> 01:00:21,097
Special deputies, pull over!

579
01:00:22,515 --> 01:00:26,019
So the farmer says
the ice broke and he fell in...

580
01:00:26,436 --> 01:00:31,233
Look at these people,
there's one person in each car.

581
01:00:31,733 --> 01:00:35,863
The city wants us to carpool,
but nobody gives a shit.

582
01:00:36,280 --> 01:00:41,371
If people carpool,
we'd be out of work. - Bullshit!

583
01:00:41,831 --> 01:00:44,499
"Why has that pig got a wooden leg?"

584
01:00:46,125 --> 01:00:49,421
"Well," said the farmer,
"about 3 months ago... "

585
01:00:49,838 --> 01:00:51,882
Look at that car!

586
01:00:52,299 --> 01:00:55,345
Hey, Budsky, there's your girlfriend.

587
01:00:56,263 --> 01:00:58,181
The Rodriguez Brothers!

588
01:00:58,599 --> 01:01:01,893
We got the whole team here tonight,
let's settle this for good.

589
01:01:02,310 --> 01:01:04,981
Let's do it!
- Pull over!

590
01:01:06,525 --> 01:01:08,069
Shit, it's Bud!

591
01:01:15,994 --> 01:01:17,120
Don't lose him!

592
01:01:20,791 --> 01:01:22,794
Take it easy. Stop the car!

593
01:01:51,327 --> 01:01:54,913
Motherfucker, come on!
What are you waiting for?

594
01:01:55,372 --> 01:01:57,918
Motherfucker!
I kick your fucking ass! Come on!

595
01:01:58,335 --> 01:02:01,632
Come on!
What'll you do with that bat?

596
01:02:02,715 --> 01:02:07,596
You bad, Bud! This is going to
cost you plenty! - What do you mean?

597
01:02:08,347 --> 01:02:11,976
How's your neck, Napoleon?
- Dh, my neck. Yeah. Dh shit!

598
01:02:12,435 --> 01:02:14,561
I think I got whiplash!

599
01:02:14,979 --> 01:02:20,319
Besides, this isn't a repo car.
- Bullshit! I got the papers on it.

600
01:02:20,903 --> 01:02:25,117
We paid it off.
See, this is our favorite car.

601
01:02:25,534 --> 01:02:27,578
That's right! You got insurance?

602
01:02:32,792 --> 01:02:36,964
Come on, cocksucker!
Whose side are you on?

603
01:02:38,049 --> 01:02:40,550
Let me loose, God damn it!

604
01:02:48,644 --> 01:02:51,481
Shit! This is bullshit, Oly!

605
01:02:51,897 --> 01:02:55,527
Yeah, that's what I said when the
marshal woke me at 4 in the morning.

606
01:02:55,945 --> 01:02:58,030
Unfortunately, it's a summons.

607
01:02:58,448 --> 01:03:02,117
You should have refused it.
- Have you read it?

608
01:03:02,535 --> 01:03:06,122
The Rodriguez Brothers are suing us
for malicious damage, medical expenses

609
01:03:06,540 --> 01:03:10,460
and harassment, for a car they own.
- The Rodriguez Brothers are...

610
01:03:10,878 --> 01:03:14,466
you believe the Rodriguez Brothers?
They're a couple of scumbags!

611
01:03:14,925 --> 01:03:18,054
I know, but we need to sit down
and get our stories straight.

612
01:03:18,471 --> 01:03:22,475
You're taking their word over mine!
- I was there, remember?

613
01:03:24,268 --> 01:03:27,356
Go home.
Take the rest of the week off.

614
01:03:27,815 --> 01:03:31,026
The rest...? I can't take the...

615
01:03:32,904 --> 01:03:37,533
Dh I get it, so that you can get
the 20,000 dollars for the Malibu.

616
01:03:37,991 --> 01:03:41,706
Make it a fucking month!
- Well, fuck you.

617
01:03:43,250 --> 01:03:47,672
On second thought,
don't bother coming back at all.

618
01:03:48,089 --> 01:03:53,178
Great! I'll come back to get my stuff
when the place don't stink so bad.

619
01:03:59,977 --> 01:04:01,521
Shut up!

620
01:04:07,528 --> 01:04:11,616
Fucking trash!
I wonder how much they owe?

621
01:04:12,034 --> 01:04:16,496
Most of them are on the run, not even
using their social security numbers.

622
01:04:16,955 --> 01:04:19,877
If there was only a way
to make them pay...

623
01:04:20,293 --> 01:04:25,132
Jesus, Bud, they're winos!
They don't have money.

624
01:04:25,548 --> 01:04:28,968
Would they be bums if they did?
- Do you want out?

625
01:04:29,386 --> 01:04:31,641
No!
- What's the matter with you?

626
01:04:32,057 --> 01:04:34,894
Don't you like your job anymore?

627
01:04:36,688 --> 01:04:40,192
I feel like we're not
communicating anymore.

628
01:04:40,609 --> 01:04:45,405
When we first started out,
I thought I could teach you something.

629
01:04:45,823 --> 01:04:47,365
Answer me!

630
01:05:13,730 --> 01:05:19,611
I'm picking up the dead body.
I've got my hands around it.

631
01:05:20,529 --> 01:05:24,327
I'm carrying his limp torso
to the truck.

632
01:05:24,743 --> 01:05:29,332
He feels like he's
been dead only a little while.

633
01:07:10,160 --> 01:07:13,871
Do you ever feel as if your mind
had started to erode?

634
01:07:14,997 --> 01:07:16,292
No.

635
01:07:18,710 --> 01:07:20,086
Ever been to Utah?

636
01:07:22,046 --> 01:07:26,219
Sir, I represent the
"Helping Hand Acceptance Corporation. "

637
01:07:26,635 --> 01:07:29,599
Radiation, yes indeed!

638
01:07:30,308 --> 01:07:33,478
You hear the most
outrageous lies about it.

639
01:07:33,895 --> 01:07:38,733
Half-baked, goggle-boxed do-gooders
telling everybody it's bad for you.

640
01:07:39,151 --> 01:07:45,449
Pernicious nonsense! Everybody could
stand 100 chest x-rays a year.

641
01:07:46,325 --> 01:07:47,786
They should have them too.

642
01:07:48,202 --> 01:07:51,164
When they cancelled the project,
it almost did me in.

643
01:07:51,623 --> 01:07:55,379
One day my mind was ready to burst,
the next day, nothing!

644
01:07:55,796 --> 01:07:57,507
Swept away.

645
01:07:59,509 --> 01:08:03,930
But I showed them.
I had a lobotomy in the end.

646
01:08:04,348 --> 01:08:07,684
Lobotomy? Isn't that for loonies?

647
01:08:08,143 --> 01:08:11,813
Not at all.
A friend of mine had one.

648
01:08:12,272 --> 01:08:17,112
Designer of the neutron bomb.
Ever heard of the neutron bomb?

649
01:08:17,696 --> 01:08:21,493
Destroys people,
leaves buildings standing.

650
01:08:21,911 --> 01:08:27,040
Fits in a suitcase so small, no one
knows it's there, until: blam!

651
01:08:28,125 --> 01:08:32,588
Eyes melt,
skin explodes, everybody dead.

652
01:08:34,215 --> 01:08:38,346
It's so immoral working on it,
it can drive you mad.

653
01:08:39,012 --> 01:08:42,475
That happened to a friend of mine,
so he had a lobotomy.

654
01:08:43,683 --> 01:08:45,853
Now he's well again.

655
01:08:48,149 --> 01:08:52,363
What kind of car does he drive?

656
01:08:53,488 --> 01:08:54,489
Chevy Malibu.

657
01:08:56,074 --> 01:08:59,370
This is really a nice old car.
Why don't you let me drive?

658
01:08:59,828 --> 01:09:01,956
What do you mean?

659
01:09:02,414 --> 01:09:06,293
I don't know... I mean...
don't you feel funny?

660
01:09:06,710 --> 01:09:09,840
Why should I feel funny?

661
01:09:10,674 --> 01:09:12,970
The two hemispheres
are fundamentally at odds.

662
01:09:13,887 --> 01:09:16,015
Hemisphere, hemisphere.

663
01:09:16,431 --> 01:09:19,351
It's strange,
I do feel funny...

664
01:10:50,375 --> 01:10:54,088
PARTY AT MILLERS
CU THERE!

665
01:10:56,758 --> 01:11:00,387
Here's the young new waver
we've all heard so much about.

666
01:11:01,222 --> 01:11:03,681
My old man used to
have a Mohawk.

667
01:11:04,140 --> 01:11:06,184
He was in the service then.

668
01:11:06,602 --> 01:11:10,523
He was such a monster,
I used to have to tell him no.

669
01:11:10,941 --> 01:11:15,612
My old man was the same,
until we got married.

670
01:11:16,030 --> 01:11:17,906
Hey Oly, your wife's all over Otto.

671
01:11:18,490 --> 01:11:21,536
Like flies on shit.

672
01:11:21,954 --> 01:11:25,916
Have you seen Bud?
- Who?

673
01:12:03,460 --> 01:12:05,712
Hey Ace, wait up.

674
01:12:08,507 --> 01:12:12,012
You want to talk about it?
- Talk about what?

675
01:12:13,346 --> 01:12:17,227
Why are you so mad at me?
- I'm not mad at you.

676
01:12:17,645 --> 01:12:20,314
I'm not.
- All right. DK.

677
01:12:21,231 --> 01:12:23,316
Debbi?
- What?

678
01:12:25,318 --> 01:12:27,405
I've been thinking.

679
01:12:28,696 --> 01:12:31,117
Now that we got some money,

680
01:12:31,534 --> 01:12:33,578
and Archie's gone...

681
01:12:35,204 --> 01:12:38,627
don't you think
it's time we settled down?

682
01:12:40,170 --> 01:12:42,215
Get a little house?

683
01:12:43,256 --> 01:12:46,761
I want you to have my baby.
- Why?

684
01:12:48,429 --> 01:12:50,557
I don't know.

685
01:12:51,559 --> 01:12:53,812
Everybody does it.

686
01:12:54,227 --> 01:12:57,731
And it just seems
like the thing to do.

687
01:12:58,690 --> 01:13:00,651
Asshole.

688
01:13:02,489 --> 01:13:04,782
Let's do the job!

689
01:13:11,790 --> 01:13:14,084
Duke! Debbi! What are you doing here?

690
01:13:14,501 --> 01:13:16,962
What's it look like, Ace?
- Against the wall!

691
01:13:18,672 --> 01:13:22,343
I'll kill him! I kill everybody!

692
01:13:23,304 --> 01:13:24,345
Drop it, motherfucker!

693
01:13:33,274 --> 01:13:34,317
Shit!

694
01:14:06,228 --> 01:14:10,191
Is it too late to get
romantically involved?

695
01:14:10,609 --> 01:14:12,569
A little.

696
01:14:13,153 --> 01:14:16,406
Wait! Stick with me,
and I'll make you a repo wife.

697
01:14:16,865 --> 01:14:18,911
Bullocks!

698
01:14:21,663 --> 01:14:22,749
Here!

699
01:14:42,270 --> 01:14:44,275
I'm here, man.

700
01:14:45,150 --> 01:14:47,361
The lights are growing dim.

701
01:14:50,240 --> 01:14:54,661
I know a life of crime led me
to this sorry fate...

702
01:14:55,161 --> 01:14:59,623
And yet,
I blame society.

703
01:15:01,418 --> 01:15:04,171
Society made me
what I am.

704
01:15:04,589 --> 01:15:10,972
Bullshit! You're a white
suburban punk, just like me.

705
01:15:11,389 --> 01:15:15,645
But it still hurts.

706
01:15:21,901 --> 01:15:24,069
You're gonna be all right.

707
01:15:30,118 --> 01:15:31,536
Maybe not.

708
01:15:36,001 --> 01:15:41,174
He's dead all right. - No doubt.
- A goner. - Man.

709
01:15:42,550 --> 01:15:45,220
Booth's setting him on fire.

710
01:15:59,945 --> 01:16:01,198
The car!

711
01:16:01,615 --> 01:16:04,201
The Chevy Malibu! Where's the car?

712
01:16:04,619 --> 01:16:07,996
You better stay out of this.
- Why? - It's none of your business.

713
01:16:08,413 --> 01:16:12,668
You want to be a hero?
I'd rather be a chicken man. - A what?

714
01:16:13,087 --> 01:16:16,924
A chicken man.
Did you ever see a farmer's wife?

715
01:16:17,340 --> 01:16:19,092
Let go of me!

716
01:16:19,759 --> 01:16:20,719
It's peaceful, man.

717
01:16:21,178 --> 01:16:22,888
The Malibu!

718
01:16:28,396 --> 01:16:29,438
Let's go!

719
01:16:29,856 --> 01:16:34,278
No, wait. My car's gone, and we're
going to get to the bottom of this.

720
01:16:34,694 --> 01:16:36,905
Like hell we are.

721
01:16:37,740 --> 01:16:39,032
Not in my face!

722
01:16:39,783 --> 01:16:40,951
Freeze, Marlene!

723
01:16:42,203 --> 01:16:45,080
My face!
- Over my dead body.

724
01:16:45,497 --> 01:16:49,044
If that's how you want it.
- Come and get me. Come on!

725
01:16:49,462 --> 01:16:52,800
I've been wanting to for a long time.
- Come on.

726
01:16:53,217 --> 01:16:55,845
Come on, if you're man enough.
- Hey Plettsch!

727
01:16:56,888 --> 01:16:58,682
Coffee break!

728
01:17:13,906 --> 01:17:18,412
Good evening, Otto.
This is Agent Rogersz.

729
01:17:19,288 --> 01:17:21,667
I'm going to
ask you a few questions.

730
01:17:22,125 --> 01:17:26,798
Since time is short and you may lie,
I'm going to have to torture you.

731
01:17:27,381 --> 01:17:30,342
But I want you to know,
it isn't personal.

732
01:17:30,760 --> 01:17:35,848
This isn't really necessary. I'll
tell you anything you want to know.

733
01:17:36,266 --> 01:17:39,978
Good. Where is the Malibu?
- I don't know.

734
01:17:40,979 --> 01:17:43,275
Somebody
ripped it from the yard.

735
01:17:46,820 --> 01:17:50,158
I don't think he knows.
- Increase the voltage!

736
01:17:50,575 --> 01:17:55,873
But what if he's innocent?
- No one is innocent. Proceed.

737
01:18:00,502 --> 01:18:05,966
Look at them. High heels,
hairnets, ridiculous trench coats,

738
01:18:06,384 --> 01:18:07,719
how pathetic!

739
01:18:08,514 --> 01:18:12,226
Agent Rogersz, they're getting away!
- It's all part of the plan.

740
01:18:29,995 --> 01:18:32,332
Otto, pull yourself together.

741
01:18:33,627 --> 01:18:35,003
Marlene!

742
01:18:36,086 --> 01:18:39,299
What's going on?
- We're going to the hospital.

743
01:18:42,803 --> 01:18:45,389
Dr. Benway to surgery.

744
01:18:48,558 --> 01:18:53,982
Hey, I know you! You're the one
who ran into my trash.

745
01:18:55,233 --> 01:18:56,400
Shh yourself!

746
01:19:01,324 --> 01:19:05,914
Visiting hours are now over.
Thank you.

747
01:19:08,584 --> 01:19:11,585
Out of order. Take the stairs.

748
01:19:21,473 --> 01:19:24,017
Mr. Lee:

749
01:19:24,477 --> 01:19:28,315
Mr. Lee:
Please return the scalpel, Mr. Lee.

750
01:19:43,458 --> 01:19:46,626
Let me see that.
All wrong! Do it over.

751
01:19:47,044 --> 01:19:51,008
...and they won't pick it up.
- Isn't it a shame?

752
01:19:53,177 --> 01:19:58,142
It comes to something when
they expect you to pick it up.

753
01:19:58,558 --> 01:20:02,855
How are you doing?
- Ask him about the Malibu.

754
01:20:03,981 --> 01:20:05,315
About that night,

755
01:20:07,443 --> 01:20:12,575
I'm sorry I split.
I should have stayed with you.

756
01:20:13,033 --> 01:20:17,289
But when I was a kid, I had
this set of big wheels...

757
01:20:18,707 --> 01:20:21,460
Please, quiet in the stairwell.

758
01:20:36,267 --> 01:20:38,854
A very sad and
unchristian thing just happened.

759
01:20:39,271 --> 01:20:41,317
A sweet old lady's
car was stolen,

760
01:20:41,734 --> 01:20:43,194
a Chevy Malibu.

761
01:20:43,652 --> 01:20:48,784
Brothers and sisters please,
if you've seen this car,

762
01:20:49,202 --> 01:20:51,162
call this toll-free number.

763
01:20:51,580 --> 01:20:54,456
Shit.
- Praise the Lord!

764
01:20:55,999 --> 01:20:57,419
Go, go!

765
01:20:59,671 --> 01:21:00,588
Come on!

766
01:21:00,630 --> 01:21:01,673
Let's go!

767
01:21:44,182 --> 01:21:46,351
Don't shoot! All right!

768
01:21:46,767 --> 01:21:48,603
Chickenshits!

769
01:21:50,939 --> 01:21:52,315
Where's the Malibu?

770
01:21:53,525 --> 01:21:55,945
Don't even ask,
because I don't know.

771
01:21:56,361 --> 01:21:59,659
I don't have it, neither does Marlene,
nor you or your crazy friends.

772
01:22:00,077 --> 01:22:01,995
So that leaves...

773
01:22:04,080 --> 01:22:07,667
Where is he? - Where the fuck is he?
- He is risen. Holy...

774
01:22:35,659 --> 01:22:37,619
Later!
- Bye bye!

775
01:22:44,878 --> 01:22:49,509
Here's another weird one: apparently,
a hail of ice cubes is coming down

776
01:22:49,926 --> 01:22:54,390
south of downtown. Scientists
are at a loss to explain...

777
01:23:27,011 --> 01:23:28,888
Some weird fucking shit, eh?

778
01:23:31,474 --> 01:23:34,392
What's going on?
- Shit!

779
01:23:34,978 --> 01:23:39,607
11 years of repoing cars,
and what have I got? Shit!

780
01:23:40,652 --> 01:23:45,407
Bud, listen: You're sitting in a car
worth 20,000 dollars.

781
01:23:45,907 --> 01:23:49,327
Look, we turn it in and
split the money, 60-40, you and me.

782
01:23:52,206 --> 01:23:53,792
Who gets the 60, kid?

783
01:23:54,209 --> 01:23:56,628
Well, I thought,
since I found the car first, that...

784
01:23:58,589 --> 01:24:00,632
that you'd get it.

785
01:24:04,095 --> 01:24:08,016
Get away from the car.
This is your only warning.

786
01:24:08,476 --> 01:24:10,312
We got problems, man!

787
01:24:17,069 --> 01:24:18,779
No, no no no! Wait!

788
01:24:19,197 --> 01:24:24,326
Stop fucking around!
Only assholes get killed for a car.

789
01:24:24,911 --> 01:24:26,871
You calling me an asshole, punk?

790
01:24:27,289 --> 01:24:30,667
I sure am.
- Come and get me, copper!

791
01:24:31,086 --> 01:24:34,215
I'm well-armed,
and I know where you live.

792
01:24:36,550 --> 01:24:41,680
Son of a bitch! - I'd rather die
on my feet than live on my knees.

793
01:24:46,394 --> 01:24:49,732
Come on, you popsicles,
let's get that car!

794
01:24:51,858 --> 01:24:54,152
Hey Oly, there's Bud!

795
01:24:56,489 --> 01:25:00,871
We'll drive it off a cliff.
- I have the car papers. Beer anyone?

796
01:25:01,329 --> 01:25:04,250
Hey, Bud, want a beer?
- No, a cigarette.

797
01:25:04,668 --> 01:25:07,545
No beer is needed here.

798
01:25:09,006 --> 01:25:13,593
I'm touching the car.
I'm encountering a strange,

799
01:25:14,010 --> 01:25:18,098
eerie kind of forcefield.
I don't know what it is. It's...

800
01:25:29,237 --> 01:25:30,823
Go on, you popsicles!

801
01:25:33,366 --> 01:25:34,911
I'm having the same feeling...

802
01:25:45,213 --> 01:25:48,759
I love this job. - Linear and inverse
vectors merge in zero.

803
01:25:49,177 --> 01:25:51,179
This way, your Holiness!

804
01:26:01,149 --> 01:26:03,194
It's more than a job,
it's... it's a calling.

805
01:26:03,652 --> 01:26:08,783
Critical mass is at zero...
- Why, you could say it's spiritual.

806
01:26:14,457 --> 01:26:15,792
Holy sheepshit!

807
01:26:21,672 --> 01:26:23,758
Get back, get back!

808
01:26:30,891 --> 01:26:33,102
Get in there, or you don't get paid!

809
01:26:33,519 --> 01:26:36,523
Have you read this book? "Dioretix"?

810
01:26:36,982 --> 01:26:38,902
Chapter 7, verse 3.
- I've got it marked.

811
01:26:47,413 --> 01:26:51,833
Miller, what are you doing?
- I'm going for a little spin.

812
01:26:52,334 --> 01:26:54,670
But you don't know how to drive?

813
01:27:04,808 --> 01:27:06,935
Otto, don't go!

814
01:27:07,352 --> 01:27:10,189
What about our relationship?

815
01:27:11,231 --> 01:27:12,274
What?

816
01:27:13,859 --> 01:27:16,570
What about our relationship?

817
01:27:16,987 --> 01:27:18,532
Fuck that.

818
01:27:19,784 --> 01:27:21,035
You shithead!

819
01:27:21,450 --> 01:27:25,581
I'm glad I tortured you.
I'm supposed to be in that car!

820
01:27:57,161 --> 01:27:59,287
Best goddamned car in the yard.

821
01:28:31,492 --> 01:28:33,245
Wow! This is intense!

822
01:28:33,660 --> 01:28:36,331
The life of a repo man
is always intense.
