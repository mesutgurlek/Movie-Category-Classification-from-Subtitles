Yes, sir.

He should be back
in a couple minutes.

Clarice M. Good morning.

Good morning,
Mr. Crawford.

19
00:05:47,555 --> 00:05:50,849
Sorry to pull you
off of the course
at such short notice.

20
00:05:50,933 --> 00:05:52,893
Your instructors tell me
you're doing well.

I hope so. They haven't
posted any grades yet.

23

A job's come up,
and I thought about you.

24
00:06:00,443 --> 00:06:01,568
Not a job, really.

25
00:06:01,652 --> 00:06:03,320
More of
an interesting errand.

26
00:06:03,404 --> 00:06:04,613
Sit down.

27
00:06:05,073 --> 00:06:06,281
Yes, sir.

28
00:06:06,949 --> 00:06:10,327
I remember you from
my seminar at UVA.

29
00:06:11,454 --> 00:06:13,330
You grilled me pretty
hard, as I recall,

on the Bureau's
civil rights record

Graduated magna.

34
00:06:24,801 --> 00:06:27,511
Summer internships at
the Reitzinger Clinic.

35

It says here
when you graduate,

36
00:06:29,555 --> 00:06:32,557
you want to come
to work for me in
Behavioral Science.

37
00:06:32,642 --> 00:06:34,810
Yes, very much, sir.
Very much.

We're interviewing all
the serial killers
now in custody

for a psycho-behavioral
profile.

40
00:06:41,192 --> 00:06:43,902
It could be a real help
in unsolved cases.

41
00:06:43,986 --> 00:06:46,822
Most of them have been
happy to talk to us.

42
00:06:46,948 --> 00:06:49,116
Do you spook easily,
Starling?

43
00:06:49,367 --> 00:06:50,826
Not yet, sir.

44
00:06:51,202 --> 00:06:53,912
See, the one we want most,
refuses to cooperate.

45
00:06:53,996 --> 00:06:56,790
I want you to go after him
again today in the asylum.

46
00:06:56,874 --> 00:06:58,500
And who's the subject?

47
00:06:58,584 --> 00:07:00,877
The psychiatrist
Hannibal Lecter.

48
00:07:01,170 --> 00:07:03,004
Hannibal the Cannibal.

49
00:07:03,506 --> 00:07:06,007
I don't expect him
to talk to you,

50
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:10,178
but I have to be able
to say we tried.

51
00:07:10,346 --> 00:07:11,680
So if he won't cooperate,

52
00:07:11,764 --> 00:07:13,265
I want just
straight reporting.

53
00:07:13,349 --> 00:07:15,350
How's he look?
How's his cell look?

54
00:07:15,435 --> 00:07:17,060
Is he sketching, drawing?

55
00:07:17,145 --> 00:07:19,354
If he is,
what's he sketching?

56
00:07:22,692 --> 00:07:25,110
Here's a dossier
on Lecter.

57
00:07:27,697 --> 00:07:31,032
A copy of our questionnaire
and a special ID for you.

58
00:07:31,325 --> 00:07:34,035
Have your memo on my desk
by 0800 Wednesday.

59
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:35,287
Okay.

60
00:07:37,748 --> 00:07:40,876
Excuse me, sir,
but why the urgency?

61
00:07:41,002 --> 00:07:42,919
Lecter's been in prison
for so many years now.

62
00:07:43,004 --> 00:07:46,173
Is there some
connection between him
and Buffalo Bill maybe?

63
00:07:46,257 --> 00:07:47,883
I wish there were.

64
00:07:48,217 --> 00:07:50,469
I want your full
attention, Starling.

65
00:07:51,095 --> 00:07:52,137
Yes, sir.

66
00:07:52,221 --> 00:07:54,848
Be very careful
with Hannibal Lecter.

67
00:07:55,266 --> 00:07:57,100
Dr. Chilton at the asylum
will go over

68
00:07:57,185 --> 00:07:59,978
all the physical procedures
used with him.

69
00:08:00,062 --> 00:08:03,315
Do not deviate from them
for any reason whatsoever,

70
00:08:03,733 --> 00:08:06,318
and you're to tell him
nothing personal, Starling.

71
00:08:06,402 --> 00:08:09,988
Believe me, you don't
want Hannibal Lecter
inside your head.

72
00:08:10,072 --> 00:08:12,824
Just do your job,
but never forget
what he is.

73
00:08:12,909 --> 00:08:14,075
And what is that?

74
00:08:14,869 --> 00:08:16,578
CHILTON: Oh, he's a monster.

75
00:08:17,079 --> 00:08:18,580
A pure psychopath.

76
00:08:19,248 --> 00:08:21,416
So rare to capture one alive.

77
00:08:21,542 --> 00:08:22,834
From a research
point of view,

78
00:08:22,919 --> 00:08:25,212
Lecter is our most
prized asset.

79
00:08:26,923 --> 00:08:28,048
Well.

80
00:08:29,926 --> 00:08:31,676
You know, we get a lot
of detectives here,

81
00:08:31,761 --> 00:08:34,471
but I must say,
I can't ever remember
one as attractive.

82
00:08:37,099 --> 00:08:39,684
Will you be in
Baltimore overnight?

83
00:08:40,102 --> 00:08:44,105
Because this can be quite
a fun town if you have
the right guide.

84
00:08:45,274 --> 00:08:47,817
Well, I'm sure this
is a great town,
Dr. Chilton,

85
00:08:47,902 --> 00:08:51,112
but, uh, my instructions
are to talk to Dr. Lecter

86
00:08:51,197 --> 00:08:52,781
and report back
this afternoon.

87
00:08:53,115 --> 00:08:54,282
I see.

88
00:08:55,284 --> 00:08:56,701
Let's make this quick, then.

89
00:08:56,786 --> 00:08:58,453
We've tried to study him,
of course,

90
00:08:58,538 --> 00:09:01,414
but he's much too
sophisticated for
the standard tests.

91
00:09:01,499 --> 00:09:03,875
Oh, my,
does he hate us!

92
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:05,961
He thinks
I'm his nemesis.

93
00:09:07,505 --> 00:09:10,423
Crawford's very clever,
isn't he? Using you.

94

CLARICE: What do
you mean, sir?

95
00:09:11,968 --> 00:09:15,095
A pretty young woman
to turn him on.

96
00:09:15,304 --> 00:09:18,014
I don't believe Lecter's
even seen a woman
in eight years.

97
00:09:18,099 --> 00:09:20,350
And, oh, are you
ever his taste.

98
00:09:20,643 --> 00:09:22,060
So to speak.

99
00:09:22,144 --> 00:09:23,895
I graduated from
UVA, Doctor.

100
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:25,230
It is not a charm school.

101
00:09:25,314 --> 00:09:28,525
Good. Then you
should be able to
remember the rules.

No staples or paper
clips on his paper.

Use the sliding food
carrier. No exceptions.

If he attempts to
pass you anything,
do not accept it.

why we insist on

On the afternoon
of July 8, 1981,

115
00:09:54,385 --> 00:09:55,594
he complained
of chest pains

116
00:09:55,678 --> 00:09:57,304
and was taken to
the dispensary.

117
00:09:57,388 --> 00:10:00,098
His mouthpiece
and restraints were
removed for an EKG.

118
00:10:00,182 --> 00:10:03,018
When the nurse
leaned over him,
he did this to her.

119
00:10:05,855 --> 00:10:09,024
The doctors managed
to reset her jaw,
more or less,

00:10:09,108 --> 00:10:10,609
save one of her eyes.

121
00:10:10,693 --> 00:10:12,902
His pulse never
got above 85,

122
00:10:13,446 --> 00:10:15,447
even when he
ate her tongue.

123
00:10:16,198 --> 00:10:18,033

If Lecter feels
that you're his enemy,

126
00:10:24,582 --> 00:10:26,958
then, uh, well,
maybe we'll have
more luck

and saved me the time.

Yes, sir, but then I...
I would have missed

get near the glass?

I'm still in training

for yourself

Well, it started as a bad joke
in Kansas City Homicide.

They said, "This one likes
to skin his humps."

328
00:22:53,955 --> 00:22:56,457

in here since 1980?

something about him?

I might, if I saw

You wanted me to find him.

377
00:28:32,669 --> 00:28:35,879
His real name is
Benjamin Raspail.

378
00:28:36,423 --> 00:28:38,173
A former patient of mine,

379
00:28:38,258 --> 00:28:42,720
whose romantic attachments
ran to, shall we say,
the exotic.

380
00:28:43,388 --> 00:28:44,888
I did not kill him,
I assure you.

381
00:28:44,973 --> 00:28:47,683
Merely tucked him away
very much as I found him,

382
00:28:47,767 --> 00:28:50,310
after he'd missed
three appointments.

then who did, sir?

Best thing for him, really.

386
00:28:56,985 --> 00:28:59,194

His dress, uh, makeup...

388
00:29:03,450 --> 00:29:05,200
Raspail was a transvestite?

389
00:29:05,285 --> 00:29:07,661

Tedious. Very tedious.

392
00:29:12,792 --> 00:29:15,335
And I just think of him
as a kind of experiment,

393
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:18,839
a fledgling killer's
first effort at
transformation.

Jack Crawford is helping
your career, isn't he?

398
00:29:29,642 --> 00:29:32,686
Apparently, he likes you,
and you like him, too.

399
00:29:33,104 --> 00:29:35,022
I never thought about it.

400
00:29:35,273 --> 00:29:38,233
Do you think Jack Crawford
wants you sexually?

401
00:29:38,359 --> 00:29:39,860
True, he is much older,

402
00:29:39,944 --> 00:29:43,572
but do you think he
visualizes scenarios,
exchanges,

403
00:29:43,656 --> 00:29:45,032
fucking you?

404
00:29:47,827 --> 00:29:49,286
That doesn't interest me,
Doctor.

405

It's the sort of thing
that Miggs would say.

see a tree, or even water.

he's killed again?

We don't know why.

492
00:36:00,116 --> 00:36:03,285
There's no evidence of rape
or physical abuse
prior to death.

Her body was the only one
he took the trouble
to weight down,

He's not a drifter.

not an apartment.

combined with an older man's,
uh, self-control.

He's cautious, precise.

And he's never impulsive.
He'll never stop.

It's Buffalo Bill, isn't it?

I'm afraid I can't tell you
any more about that.

PILCHER: We heard about it
on the radio.

643
00:47:36,979 --> 00:47:40,314
You mean this is like a clue
from a real murder case?
Cool !

644
00:47:40,399 --> 00:47:42,441
Just ignore him.
He's not a Ph. D.

645
00:47:43,318 --> 00:47:46,445
A Sphingid. Ceratomia,
maybe.

646
00:47:46,530 --> 00:47:48,447
Boy, he's a big sucker.

647
00:47:49,658 --> 00:47:50,992
Okay.

648
00:47:51,118 --> 00:47:53,035
Let's check morphology.

649
00:47:57,457 --> 00:48:00,126
Uh-huh.

you're not detecting,

654
00:48:14,975 --> 00:48:16,934
Are you hitting on me,
Doctor?

655
00:48:17,227 --> 00:48:18,561
Yes.

What do you got, Roden?

00:48:20,939 --> 00:48:25,151
Agent Starling,
meet Mr. Acherontia styx.

659
00:48:26,028 --> 00:48:27,194
Weird.

660

Better known to his friends
as the Death's Head Moth.

661
00:48:30,574 --> 00:48:32,033

it come from?

662
00:48:32,117 --> 00:48:33,284
That's what's strange.

663
00:48:33,368 --> 00:48:35,077
They only live in Asia.
Asia?

664
00:48:35,162 --> 00:48:36,287
In this country,
they'd have to be

665
00:48:36,371 --> 00:48:38,039
specially raised
from imported eggs.

666
00:48:38,123 --> 00:48:41,626
Somebody grew this guy,
fed him honey and nightshade,

667
00:48:41,710 --> 00:48:43,252
kept him warm.

668
00:48:44,004 --> 00:48:45,755
Somebody loved him.

Catherine Martin,

685
00:49:55,075 --> 00:49:57,785
the 25-year-old daughter
of Senator Ruth Martin,

686
00:49:57,869 --> 00:49:59,578
listed first as
a missing person,

687
00:49:59,663 --> 00:50:01,330
is now believed to
have been kidnapped

688
00:50:01,415 --> 00:50:04,166
by the serial killer
known only as Buffalo Bill.

689
00:50:04,251 --> 00:50:05,501
Memphis police
sources indicate

690
00:50:05,585 --> 00:50:06,836
that the missing
girl's blouse

691
00:50:06,920 --> 00:50:08,879
has been identified,
sliced up the back

692
00:50:08,964 --> 00:50:10,756
in what has become
a kind of grim,

693
00:50:10,841 --> 00:50:12,591
all-too-familiar
calling card.

694
00:50:12,676 --> 00:50:14,301
Young Catherine Martin,
as we've said,

695
00:50:14,386 --> 00:50:16,637
is the only daughter
of U.S. Senator Ruth Martin,

696
00:50:16,722 --> 00:50:18,973
the Republican junior senator
from Tennessee.

697
00:50:19,057 --> 00:50:20,891
And while her kidnapping
is not, at this point,

698
00:50:20,976 --> 00:50:22,643
considered to be
politically motivated,

699
00:50:22,728 --> 00:50:25,813
nevertheless, it has
stirred the government
to its highest levels.

700
00:50:25,897 --> 00:50:28,816
Reached for a comment
on the ski slopes
of Stowe, Vermont,

701
00:50:28,900 --> 00:50:30,943
the president
himself said to be,

702
00:50:31,028 --> 00:50:32,862
and I quote,
"Intensely concerned."

703
00:50:32,946 --> 00:50:34,447
Just moments ago,
Senator Martin

704
00:50:34,489 --> 00:50:37,450
taped this dramatic
personal plea.
Excuse me.

705
00:50:37,534 --> 00:50:41,203
MARTIN: I'm speaking now
to the person who is
holding my daughter.

706
00:50:42,456 --> 00:50:45,291
Catherine is very
gentle and kind.

707
00:50:46,501 --> 00:50:48,627
Talk to her, and you'll see.

708
00:50:50,047 --> 00:50:53,299
You have the power.
You are in charge.

709
00:50:56,553 --> 00:50:59,638
I know you can feel
love and compassion.

710
00:51:01,266 --> 00:51:04,643
You have a wonderful chance
to show the whole world

711
00:51:05,312 --> 00:51:08,230
that you can be merciful
as well as strong,

712
00:51:08,857 --> 00:51:11,275
that you're big enough
to treat Catherine

713
00:51:11,359 --> 00:51:13,736
better than the world
has treated you.

714
00:51:14,279 --> 00:51:16,030
You have that power.

715
00:51:16,490 --> 00:51:17,782
Please.

716
00:51:18,658 --> 00:51:20,618
My daughter is Catherine.

717
00:51:20,702 --> 00:51:21,702
ARDELIA: Boy, that's smart.

718
00:51:21,787 --> 00:51:22,912
Release her unharmed.

719
00:51:22,996 --> 00:51:24,455
Jesus, that's really smart.

720
00:51:24,539 --> 00:51:26,749
MAN: She keeps
repeating the name.

721
00:51:26,833 --> 00:51:30,252
If he sees
Catherine as a person
and not just an object,

722
00:51:30,337 --> 00:51:32,505
it's harder to tear her up.

723
00:51:32,631 --> 00:51:34,757
Please.
Release my little girl.

724
00:51:35,967 --> 00:51:37,301
What you're doing,
Miss Starling,

725
00:51:37,385 --> 00:51:39,595
is coming into my hospital
to conduct an interview

726
00:51:39,679 --> 00:51:42,807
and refusing to share
information with me
for the third time.

727
00:51:43,600 --> 00:51:45,851
Sir, I told you,

728
00:51:45,936 --> 00:51:48,104
this is just
a routine follow-up
on the Raspail case.

He is my patient.
I have rights.

730
00:51:50,398 --> 00:51:51,607
I understand that, sir.

731
00:51:51,691 --> 00:51:55,861
Look, I am not
just some turnkey,
Miss Starling.

732
00:51:57,114 --> 00:51:59,490
This is the number for
the U.S. Attorney's
office.

733
00:51:59,574 --> 00:52:01,826
Please, either you
discuss this with him,

734
00:52:01,910 --> 00:52:04,203
or you let me do my job.
Do you understand?

735
00:52:09,292 --> 00:52:12,211
CLARICE: If your profile
helps us catch Buffalo Bill

736
00:52:12,712 --> 00:52:15,172
in time to save
Catherine Martin,

737
00:52:15,966 --> 00:52:18,467
the senator
promises you
a transfer

738
00:52:18,552 --> 00:52:21,512
to the V.A. Hospital
at Oneida Park, New York,

739
00:52:21,596 --> 00:52:22,930
with a view of
the woods nearby.

740
00:52:23,014 --> 00:52:25,724
Maximum security
still applies,
of course.

741
00:52:25,934 --> 00:52:28,602
You'd have reasonable
access to books.

742
00:52:29,396 --> 00:52:31,230
Best of all, though.

743
00:52:31,731 --> 00:52:33,315
One week of the year,

744
00:52:33,400 --> 00:52:37,486
you get to leave
the hospital and
go here.

745
00:52:40,907 --> 00:52:42,408
Plum Island.

746
00:52:43,743 --> 00:52:46,996
Every day of that week
you may walk on the beach,

747
00:52:47,080 --> 00:52:49,665
you may swim in the ocean
for up to one hour,

748
00:52:49,749 --> 00:52:53,169
under SWAT team surveillance,
of course.

749
00:52:53,795 --> 00:52:55,671
And there you have it.

750
00:52:58,300 --> 00:53:01,927
A copy of the
Buffalo Bill
case file.

751
00:53:03,513 --> 00:53:05,764
A copy of the
senator's offer.

752
00:53:06,099 --> 00:53:09,393
This offer is
non-negotiable
and final.

753
00:53:10,103 --> 00:53:11,937
If Catherine Martin dies,
you get nothing.

00:53:31,625 --> 00:53:32,875
That's only part
of the island.

758
00:53:32,959 --> 00:53:35,461
There's a very,
very nice beach.

759
00:53:35,545 --> 00:53:38,005
Terns nest there.
There's beautiful...

760
00:53:38,089 --> 00:53:40,090
Terns? Hmm.

761
00:53:41,134 --> 00:53:44,261
If I help you, Clarice,
it will be "turns"
with us, too.

762
00:53:44,346 --> 00:53:45,387
Quid pro quo.

763
00:53:45,472 --> 00:53:47,473
I tell you things,
you tell me things.

764
00:53:47,557 --> 00:53:50,476
Not about this case,
though. About yourself.

765
00:53:50,560 --> 00:53:53,229
Quid pro quo. Yes or no?

766
00:53:55,941 --> 00:53:57,608
Yes or no, Clarice?

767
00:53:57,692 --> 00:53:59,485
Poor little Catherine
is waiting.

768
00:54:00,737 --> 00:54:02,029
Go, Doctor.

769
00:54:03,240 --> 00:54:05,991
What is your worst
memory of childhood?

770
00:54:07,827 --> 00:54:09,453
The death of my father.

771
00:54:10,455 --> 00:54:13,540
Tell me about it.
And don't lie,
or I'll know.

772
00:54:14,542 --> 00:54:16,543
He was a town marshal,

773
00:54:17,879 --> 00:54:21,298
and one night
he surprised
two burglars

774
00:54:21,383 --> 00:54:24,051
coming out of the back
of a drugstore.

775
00:54:25,011 --> 00:54:26,136
They shot him.

776
00:54:27,055 --> 00:54:29,014
Was he killed outright?

777
00:54:29,474 --> 00:54:31,976
No. He was very strong.

778
00:54:32,060 --> 00:54:33,852
He lasted more than a month.

779
00:54:34,854 --> 00:54:37,481
My mother died
when I was very young,

780
00:54:39,150 --> 00:54:41,402
so my father had become
the whole world to me,

781
00:54:41,486 --> 00:54:43,988
and when he left me,
I had nothing.

782
00:54:44,072 --> 00:54:45,823
I was ten years old.

783
00:54:46,825 --> 00:54:48,951
You're very frank, Clarice.

784
00:54:49,744 --> 00:54:53,747
I think it would
be quite something to
know you in private life.

785
00:54:56,543 --> 00:54:58,252
Quid pro quo, Doctor.

786
00:54:59,337 --> 00:55:01,630
So tell me about
Miss West Virginia.

787
00:55:01,715 --> 00:55:03,716
Was she a large girl?

788
00:55:06,511 --> 00:55:07,636
Yes.

789
00:55:07,721 --> 00:55:10,264
Big through the hips? Roomy?

790
00:55:10,348 --> 00:55:12,057
They all were.

791
00:55:12,225 --> 00:55:13,475
What else?

792
00:55:13,560 --> 00:55:17,354
She had an object
deliberately inserted
into her throat.

793
00:55:17,564 --> 00:55:20,357
Now, that hasn't
been made public yet.

794
00:55:20,442 --> 00:55:22,484
We don't know
what it means.

795
00:55:22,569 --> 00:55:24,153
Was it a butterfly?

796
00:55:25,447 --> 00:55:27,406
Yes. A moth.

797
00:55:28,616 --> 00:55:32,745
Just like the one we found
in Benjamin Raspail's head
an hour ago.

798
00:55:34,247 --> 00:55:36,540
Why does he place
them there, Doctor?

799
00:55:37,292 --> 00:55:40,669
The significance
of the moth is change.

800
00:55:41,421 --> 00:55:44,340
Caterpillar into
chrysalis or pupa,

801
00:55:45,050 --> 00:55:47,092
and from thence into beauty.

802
00:55:48,011 --> 00:55:50,346
Our Billy wants
to change, too.

803
00:55:51,598 --> 00:55:53,307
There's no correlation
in literature

804
00:55:53,391 --> 00:55:55,017
between transsexualism
and violence.

805
00:55:55,101 --> 00:55:56,685
Transsexuals
are very passive...

806
00:55:56,770 --> 00:55:58,354
Clever girl.

807
00:55:58,438 --> 00:56:00,314
You're so close to the way
you're gonna catch him.

808
00:56:00,398 --> 00:56:01,774
Do you realize that?

809
00:56:02,108 --> 00:56:03,484
No. Tell me why.

810
00:56:04,778 --> 00:56:06,904
After your father's murder,
you were orphaned.

811
00:56:06,988 --> 00:56:08,447
What happened next?

812
00:56:12,369 --> 00:56:16,455
I don't imagine
the answer is on those
second-rate shoes, Clarice.

813
00:56:17,248 --> 00:56:20,834
I went to live
with my mother's cousin
and her husband in Montana.

814
00:56:20,919 --> 00:56:22,586
They had a ranch.

815
00:56:22,879 --> 00:56:24,546
Was it a cattle ranch?

816
00:56:24,631 --> 00:56:26,006
Sheep and horses.

817
00:56:26,841 --> 00:56:28,467
How long did you live there?

818
00:56:29,302 --> 00:56:30,636
Two months.

819
00:56:30,720 --> 00:56:32,054
Why so briefly?

820
00:56:32,430 --> 00:56:33,680
I ran away.

821
00:56:33,973 --> 00:56:35,724
Why, Clarice?

822
00:56:35,809 --> 00:56:38,060
Did the rancher make
you perform fellatio?

823
00:56:38,144 --> 00:56:40,187
Did he sodomize you?

824
00:56:40,814 --> 00:56:43,732
No. He was a very decent man.

825
00:56:45,610 --> 00:56:47,444
Quid pro quo, Doctor.

826
00:56:49,531 --> 00:56:52,032
Billy is not
a real transsexual.

827
00:56:52,117 --> 00:56:54,284
But he thinks he is.
He tries to be.

828
00:56:54,369 --> 00:56:56,620
He's tried to be
a lot of things, I expect.

829
00:56:57,497 --> 00:56:58,747
And you said that
I was very close

830
00:56:58,832 --> 00:56:59,957
to the way
we would catch him.

831
00:57:00,041 --> 00:57:01,417
What did you mean, Doctor?

832
00:57:01,501 --> 00:57:04,086
There are three major centers
for transsexual surgery.

833
00:57:04,170 --> 00:57:08,632
Johns Hopkins,
the University of Minnesota,
and Columbus Medical Center.

834
00:57:08,716 --> 00:57:12,010
I wouldn't be surprised
if Billy had applied
for sex reassignment

835
00:57:12,095 --> 00:57:15,013
at one or all of them
and been rejected.

836
00:57:16,141 --> 00:57:17,975
On what basis
would they reject him?

837

LECTER: Look for severe
childhood disturbances

838
00:57:21,646 --> 00:57:23,647
associated with violence.

839
00:57:23,731 --> 00:57:26,733
Our Billy wasn't born
a criminal, Clarice.

840
00:57:26,818 --> 00:57:30,362
He was made one through
years of systematic abuse.

841
00:57:30,947 --> 00:57:34,616
Billy hates his own
identity, you see,

842
00:57:34,701 --> 00:57:37,453
and he thinks that
makes him a transsexual.

843
00:57:37,537 --> 00:57:41,457
But his pathology
is a thousand times
more savage

844
00:57:41,541 --> 00:57:43,375
and more terrifying.

It rubs the lotion
on its skin.

846
00:57:49,048 --> 00:57:51,216
It does this
whenever it's told.

847
00:57:51,885 --> 00:57:53,802
Mister, my family
will pay cash.

848
00:57:53,887 --> 00:57:56,847
Whatever ransom
you're asking for,
they'll pay it.

849
00:57:57,682 --> 00:57:59,892
It rubs the lotion
on its skin,

850
00:57:59,976 --> 00:58:02,144
or else it gets
the hose again.

851
00:58:04,355 --> 00:58:06,940
Yes, she will, Precious.
She will get the hose.

852
00:58:07,817 --> 00:58:09,943
(SOBBING) Okay, okay, okay.

853
00:58:11,404 --> 00:58:13,447
Okay. I'm there.

854
00:58:13,573 --> 00:58:14,740
Okay.

855
00:58:16,242 --> 00:58:18,410
Mister, if you let me go,

856
00:58:18,495 --> 00:58:20,162
I won't... I won't
press charges.

857
00:58:20,246 --> 00:58:21,622
I promise.

858
00:58:22,624 --> 00:58:25,125
See, my mom is a real
important woman.

859
00:58:25,210 --> 00:58:27,419
I guess you
already know that.

860
00:58:27,504 --> 00:58:30,214
Now it places the

I want to go home.

I want to go home, please!
Please, I want to...

863
00:58:39,140 --> 00:58:41,683
It places the lotion
in the basket.

I want to see my mommy!
Please.

I want to see
my mother again.

I want to... I want
to see my mommy.

(LAUGHING) No,
I don't think so.

874

She never heard
of any deal with you.

phony offer to Lecter

Buffalo Bill's real name

But Raspail had become
very frightened.

931
01:03:43,736 --> 01:03:46,947
Apparently, Louis had
murdered a transient

with her skin.

01:04:52,805 --> 01:04:54,055
with Senator Ruth Martin,

957
01:04:54,140 --> 01:04:57,183
Dr. Lecter agreed to assist
in the investigation

958
01:04:57,268 --> 01:04:58,643
of trying to find the abductor

959
01:04:58,728 --> 01:05:00,061
of Catherine Martin,
Buffalo Bill.

960
01:05:00,146 --> 01:05:01,187
How do you fit in, sir?

961
01:05:01,272 --> 01:05:02,772
Well, it's only through
my own unique insight

962
01:05:02,857 --> 01:05:04,900
into Lecter's mind
that this breakthrough
was possible.

963
01:05:04,984 --> 01:05:06,067
And Buffalo Bill's
real name...

964
01:05:06,152 --> 01:05:08,820
Buffalo Bill's real name
is now a matter of record

965
01:05:08,905 --> 01:05:10,030
with the proper authorities.

966
01:05:10,114 --> 01:05:11,406
Can you give us
any more information?

967
01:05:11,490 --> 01:05:12,699
My name is
Dr. Frederick Chilton.

968
01:05:12,783 --> 01:05:14,284
How do you spell that?
C-H...

969
01:05:16,037 --> 01:05:18,121
Are you with
Dr. Chilton's group?

970
01:05:18,205 --> 01:05:20,457
Oh, well, I just saw
him outside, sir.

971
01:05:20,833 --> 01:05:22,584
Access to Lecter
is strictly limited.

972
01:05:22,668 --> 01:05:24,252
We've been getting
death threats.

973
01:05:24,337 --> 01:05:26,004
I understand, sir.

974
01:05:32,136 --> 01:05:34,179
Log in. Check your weapon.

975
01:05:34,931 --> 01:05:37,390
KRENDLER: Well, I can't take
all the credit for myself.

976
01:05:37,475 --> 01:05:40,018
Senator Martin,
the Justice Department,
the people at the FBI,

977
01:05:40,102 --> 01:05:42,270
the folks at the
Baltimore State Hospital.

978
01:05:42,355 --> 01:05:45,190
And now for the hard part,
apprehending the suspect.

979

Excuse me, folks,
I'm gonna have
to catch a flight.

982
01:06:03,334 --> 01:06:05,293
OFFICER: Is it true
what they're saying?

983
01:06:05,628 --> 01:06:06,795
Huh?

984
01:06:07,380 --> 01:06:09,422
He's some kind of vampire?

985
01:06:11,759 --> 01:06:13,468
They don't have
a name for what he is.

You do know the rules,
ma'am?

988
01:06:17,473 --> 01:06:20,058
Yes, Lieutenant Boyle.
I've questioned him before.

989
01:06:23,437 --> 01:06:24,729
Go ahead.

990
01:07:01,726 --> 01:07:03,601
Good evening, Clarice.

991
01:07:05,187 --> 01:07:08,106
I thought you might like
your drawings back, Doctor.

992
01:07:10,776 --> 01:07:12,610
Just until you get your view.

993
01:07:13,446 --> 01:07:15,238
How very thoughtful.

994
01:07:16,574 --> 01:07:19,659
Or did Jack Crawford send
you for one last wheedle

995
01:07:19,744 --> 01:07:21,953
before you're both
booted off the case?

996
01:07:22,371 --> 01:07:24,706
No. I came
because I wanted to.

997
01:07:29,295 --> 01:07:31,588

we're in love.

That was an especially
nice touch, Clarice.

01:07:41,807 --> 01:07:43,099
Yours?

1002
01:07:43,392 --> 01:07:44,476
Yes.

1003
01:07:44,894 --> 01:07:48,021
Yeah ! That was good.

1004
01:07:48,981 --> 01:07:50,815
Pity about poor Catherine,
though.

1009
01:08:02,578 --> 01:08:03,578
Oh, Clarice.

1010
01:08:03,662 --> 01:08:06,498
Your problem
is you need to get
more fun out of life.

1011
01:08:07,083 --> 01:08:10,043
You were telling me the truth
back in Baltimore, sir.

1012
01:08:10,127 --> 01:08:11,920
Please continue now.

1013
01:08:12,213 --> 01:08:15,090
Well, I have read
the case files, have you?

1014

Everything you need
to find him

is right there
in those pages.

1016
01:08:18,344 --> 01:08:19,427
Then tell me how.

1017
01:08:19,512 --> 01:08:23,181
First principles, Clarice.
Simplicity.

1018
01:08:23,390 --> 01:08:24,891
Read Marcus Aurelius.

1019
01:08:24,975 --> 01:08:28,269
Of each particular thing,
ask what is it in itself?

1020
01:08:28,604 --> 01:08:30,105
What is its nature?

1021
01:08:30,815 --> 01:08:34,567
What does he do,
this man you seek?

1022
01:08:36,195 --> 01:08:37,695
He kills women.

1023
01:08:37,780 --> 01:08:40,532
No! That is incidental.

1024
01:08:41,492 --> 01:08:43,284
What is the first
and principal thing
he does?

1025
01:08:43,369 --> 01:08:46,663
What needs does
he serve by killing?

1026
01:08:47,248 --> 01:08:48,414
Anger.

1027
01:08:48,499 --> 01:08:52,293
Um, social acceptance

1028
01:08:52,378 --> 01:08:54,462
and, uh,
sexual frustrations...

1029
01:08:54,547 --> 01:08:57,465
No! He covets.

1030
01:08:58,843 --> 01:09:00,593
That is his nature.

1031
01:09:00,970 --> 01:09:03,596
And how do we begin
to covet, Clarice?

1032
01:09:04,140 --> 01:09:06,474
Do we seek out
things to covet?

1033
01:09:07,184 --> 01:09:09,227
Make an effort to answer now.

1034
01:09:09,311 --> 01:09:11,563
No. We just...

1035
01:09:12,022 --> 01:09:15,483
No. We begin by coveting
what we see every day.

1036
01:09:15,568 --> 01:09:18,862
Don't you feel eyes moving
over your body, Clarice?

1037
01:09:19,613 --> 01:09:22,824
And don't your eyes
seek out the things
you want?

1038
01:09:23,742 --> 01:09:26,452
All right. Yes. Now
please tell me how.

1039
01:09:26,537 --> 01:09:30,498
No. It is your turn
to tell me, Clarice.

1040
01:09:30,583 --> 01:09:33,042
You don't have any more
vacations to sell.

1041
01:09:33,752 --> 01:09:36,004
Why did you leave that ranch?

1042
01:09:36,589 --> 01:09:40,258
Doctor, we don't
have any more time
for any of this now.

1043
01:09:40,676 --> 01:09:43,344
But we don't reckon
time the same way,
do we, Clarice?

1044
01:09:43,429 --> 01:09:45,346
This is all the time
you'll ever have.

1045
01:09:45,431 --> 01:09:47,849
Later. Now, please,
listen to me. We've
only got five...

1046
01:09:47,933 --> 01:09:51,102
No! I will listen now.

1047
01:09:53,522 --> 01:09:55,356
After your father's murder,
you were orphaned.

1048
01:09:55,441 --> 01:09:56,691
You were ten years old.

1049
01:09:56,775 --> 01:10:00,528
You went to live with cousins
on a sheep and horse ranch
in Montana.

1050
01:10:00,613 --> 01:10:01,738
And?

1051
01:10:03,866 --> 01:10:06,034
And one morning,
I just ran away.

1052
01:10:06,827 --> 01:10:09,913
Not "just", Clarice.
What set you off?

1053
01:10:10,581 --> 01:10:12,207
You started at what time?

1054
01:10:12,833 --> 01:10:14,292
Early. Still dark.

1055
01:10:14,376 --> 01:10:15,835
Then something woke you,
didn't it?

1056
01:10:15,920 --> 01:10:18,379
Was it a dream? What was it?

1057
01:10:19,757 --> 01:10:21,466
I heard a strange noise.

1058
01:10:22,760 --> 01:10:24,177
What was it?

1059
01:10:24,678 --> 01:10:28,181
It was screaming.

1060
01:10:30,309 --> 01:10:33,269
Some kind of screaming,
like a child's voice.

1061
01:10:33,479 --> 01:10:35,104
What did you do?

1062
01:10:35,606 --> 01:10:39,150
I went downstairs, outside.

1063
01:10:41,987 --> 01:10:43,988
I crept up into the barn.

1064
01:10:44,657 --> 01:10:47,659
I was so scared
to look inside,
but I had to.

1065
01:10:48,869 --> 01:10:50,745
And what did you see,
Clarice?

1066
01:10:50,829 --> 01:10:52,330
What did you see?

1067
01:10:53,791 --> 01:10:57,335
Lambs. They were screaming.

1068
01:10:58,545 --> 01:11:01,339
They were slaughtering
the spring lambs?

1069
01:11:01,632 --> 01:11:03,633
And they were screaming.

1070
01:11:04,969 --> 01:11:06,636
And you ran away?

1071
01:11:06,720 --> 01:11:07,929
No.

1072
01:11:08,555 --> 01:11:10,682
First I tried to free them.
l...

1073
01:11:11,225 --> 01:11:13,685
I opened
the gate to their pen,
but they wouldn't run.

1074
01:11:13,769 --> 01:11:15,979
They just stood there,
confused.

1075
01:11:16,063 --> 01:11:17,397
They wouldn't run.

1076
01:11:17,481 --> 01:11:20,149
But you could and you did,
didn't you?

1077
01:11:20,859 --> 01:11:24,320
Yes. I took one lamb,
and I ran away as
fast as I could.

1078
01:11:24,405 --> 01:11:25,697
Where were you going,
Clarice?

1079
01:11:25,781 --> 01:11:26,990
I don't know.

1080
01:11:27,074 --> 01:11:29,909
I didn't have any food,
any water,

1081
01:11:29,994 --> 01:11:32,537
and it was very cold,
very cold.

1082
01:11:34,540 --> 01:11:36,582
I thought...

1083
01:11:36,667 --> 01:11:39,210
I thought if I could
save just one, but,

1084
01:11:41,088 --> 01:11:42,714
he was so heavy.

1085
01:11:43,841 --> 01:11:45,466
He was so heavy.

1086
01:11:50,597 --> 01:11:52,432
I didn't get more
than a few miles

1087
01:11:52,516 --> 01:11:54,642
when the sheriff's car
picked me up.

1088
01:11:57,730 --> 01:11:58,980
The rancher was so angry,

1089
01:11:59,064 --> 01:12:02,567
he sent me to live at
the Lutheran orphanage
in Bozeman.

1090
01:12:02,651 --> 01:12:04,569
I never saw the ranch again.

1091
01:12:05,571 --> 01:12:08,031
What became of your lamb,
Clarice?

1092
01:12:10,117 --> 01:12:11,743
They killed him.

1093
01:12:11,827 --> 01:12:14,203
You still wake up
sometimes, don't you?

1094
01:12:14,288 --> 01:12:18,875
Wake up in the dark
and hear the screaming
of the lambs.

1095
01:12:19,918 --> 01:12:21,044
Yes.

1096
01:12:22,755 --> 01:12:25,465
And you think if you
save poor Catherine,

1097
01:12:25,549 --> 01:12:27,133
you could make them stop,
don't you?

1098
01:12:27,217 --> 01:12:29,510
You think if Catherine lives,

1099
01:12:29,595 --> 01:12:32,764
you won't wake up in
the dark ever again

1100
01:12:32,848 --> 01:12:35,767
to that awful
screaming of the lambs.

1101
01:12:36,977 --> 01:12:39,937
I don't know. I don't know.

1102
01:12:42,024 --> 01:12:45,651
Thank you, Clarice.
Thank you.

1103
01:12:46,612 --> 01:12:48,654
Tell me his name, Doctor.

1104
01:12:55,537 --> 01:12:57,455
Dr. Chilton, I presume.

1105
01:12:58,415 --> 01:13:00,583
I think you know each other.

1106
01:13:02,127 --> 01:13:03,419
Okay.

1107
01:13:04,213 --> 01:13:05,380
We found her.

1108
01:13:05,464 --> 01:13:06,589
Let's go!

1109
01:13:06,673 --> 01:13:08,549
It's your turn, Doctor.

1110
01:13:08,634 --> 01:13:09,717
Out.

1111
01:13:09,802 --> 01:13:10,843
Tell me his name.

1112
01:13:10,928 --> 01:13:12,136
Sorry, ma'am,
I've got orders.

1113
01:13:12,221 --> 01:13:13,596
