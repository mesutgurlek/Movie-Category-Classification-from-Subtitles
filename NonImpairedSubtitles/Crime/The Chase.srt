1
00:01:02,275 --> 00:01:04,485
I had a really good time.

2
00:01:06,279 --> 00:01:08,239
- Yes?
- Marlboro. Hard pack.

3
00:01:10,032 --> 00:01:12,159
This, and, uh...

4
00:01:12,285 --> 00:01:14,245
five bucks on number five.

5
00:01:58,581 --> 00:02:01,959
Yeah, I gotta pick
something up for the wife.

6
00:02:25,441 --> 00:02:27,902
Come on, pal.
I'm growing a beard over here.

7
00:02:27,985 --> 00:02:30,488
I can never get these silly things.

8
00:02:32,823 --> 00:02:35,326
Thar she blows!

9
00:02:42,124 --> 00:02:44,043
All units, code 503.

10
00:02:44,126 --> 00:02:49,924
1989 silver Volkswagen Rabbit, California
plate number boy-uncle-seven 9-9-6.

11
00:02:50,007 --> 00:02:52,927
Repeat: Stolen vehicle.
'89 Volkswagen Rabbit.

12
00:02:53,010 --> 00:02:56,138
Silver. Boy-uncle-seven 9-9-6.

13
00:02:56,264 --> 00:02:58,307
Any unit respond.

14
00:03:04,730 --> 00:03:07,233
Look, just keep the change.
All right?

15
00:03:07,316 --> 00:03:09,360
Excuse me.

16
00:03:09,485 --> 00:03:12,905
That wouldn't be your Rabbit
by any chance, would it?

17
00:03:13,030 --> 00:03:14,949
Mine?

18
00:03:15,032 --> 00:03:17,451
Oh, no. No, sir.
I'm... I'm on foot.

19
00:03:17,535 --> 00:03:21,581
I was just, uh,
out for a little jog, you know.

20
00:03:22,790 --> 00:03:25,501
Here you go.
Five dollars on number five.

21
00:03:25,626 --> 00:03:27,295
And your change, sir.

22
00:03:27,378 --> 00:03:31,048
Jogged, huh?

23
00:03:33,509 --> 00:03:35,928
Come here! Don't do it!

24
00:03:36,012 --> 00:03:38,222
- Ho! Ho! Ho! Ho! Ho!
- Whoa.! Whoa.! Whoa.!

25
00:03:38,347 --> 00:03:42,268
- I'll blow a hole right through her, man!
- Let's not do nothin' stupid!

26
00:03:42,393 --> 00:03:45,146
- Oh, my God! Don't hurt me!
- Come on, buddy! Let her go!

27
00:03:45,271 --> 00:03:47,273
We're just talking a stolen car here.

28
00:03:47,356 --> 00:03:50,818
Put the gun down. You don't wanna make
things worse for yourself, do ya?

29
00:03:50,943 --> 00:03:53,905
Things couldn't possibly
be worse for myself.

30
00:03:54,030 --> 00:03:55,740
- Don't even think about it, hero.!
- Hey, hey, hey.

31
00:03:55,865 --> 00:03:58,576
Now, you, join your partner over there.

32
00:03:59,619 --> 00:04:02,163
Keep your hands high.
Both of you!

33
00:04:04,540 --> 00:04:07,084
Hey, you!
Grab their guns!

34
00:04:10,546 --> 00:04:12,840
- Who, me?
- Yes, you, you mutt!

35
00:04:14,217 --> 00:04:17,094
Just take it easy.
Think about what you're doing.

36
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:19,096
What am I doing?

37
00:04:19,222 --> 00:04:22,308
- I won't go to jail for this?
- No, you won't go to jail.

38
00:04:22,391 --> 00:04:25,853
- Now put 'em on the floor
and kick 'em over to me.

39
00:04:37,406 --> 00:04:39,700
I said kick 'em over to me, Pelé.

40
00:04:52,421 --> 00:04:54,173
Hey, hey.! No.! No.! Wrong.!

41
00:04:54,257 --> 00:04:56,175
Tell you what.

42
00:04:56,259 --> 00:04:59,178
Pick up the goddamn guns
and hand 'em to me.

43
00:05:02,598 --> 00:05:04,559
By the barrels.

44
00:05:10,815 --> 00:05:12,775
Put 'em in my pockets.

45
00:05:18,114 --> 00:05:20,658
Good boy, nickels.

46
00:05:22,702 --> 00:05:24,620
Damn it.

47
00:05:24,704 --> 00:05:26,622
All right. Okay, now everybody...

48
00:05:26,706 --> 00:05:29,208
on the floor!

49
00:05:29,292 --> 00:05:32,712
- You won't get away with this.
- You don't know that.

50
00:05:32,795 --> 00:05:36,174
- Faces flat!
- Don't kill me! I don't wanna die!

51
00:05:36,299 --> 00:05:39,177
You won't if everybody does
exactly as I say.

52
00:05:40,386 --> 00:05:42,305
Holy shit.!

53
00:05:42,388 --> 00:05:44,765
- Holy shit!
- Don't shoot! We're staying down!

54
00:05:44,849 --> 00:05:46,767
I'm not fooling around here!

55
00:05:46,851 --> 00:05:49,604
I told you to keep your faces
against the floor!

56
00:05:49,687 --> 00:05:52,148
Okay, okay. We don't
want anybody to get hurt.

57
00:05:52,231 --> 00:05:54,859
Now, if you want
this young lady to live...

58
00:05:54,984 --> 00:05:56,861
nobody moves
until we're a memory.

59
00:05:56,986 --> 00:05:58,779
- Did you drive?
- Yes.

60
00:05:58,905 --> 00:06:01,949
All right, get out your keys.
We're going for a joyride. Do it!

61
00:06:06,579 --> 00:06:08,539
Open the door.
Open the door.

62
00:06:10,333 --> 00:06:13,211
Kill it. Kill it!

63
00:06:13,336 --> 00:06:15,213
Keys.

64
00:06:15,338 --> 00:06:18,299
Get in. Move. Over.
All the way over.

65
00:06:29,060 --> 00:06:30,436
We've been patrolling...

66
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:31,938
- Wait. Not yet.
- Sorry.

67
00:06:32,021 --> 00:06:34,440
Okay, we're rolling. And action.

68
00:06:34,524 --> 00:06:38,444
We've been patrolling these Newport Beach
streets together for, what... six years?

69
00:06:38,528 --> 00:06:40,947
- Six and a half.
- Six and a half.

70
00:06:41,030 --> 00:06:44,116
You know, when people think
Newport Beach they don't think "crime. "

71
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:46,619
They think palm trees, the beach.

72
00:06:46,702 --> 00:06:50,915
But let me tell ya, we get as much crime
here as in any other city.

73
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:52,917
You know, proportionate-wise.

74
00:06:53,042 --> 00:06:54,919
Proportionate-wise, obviously.

75
00:06:55,044 --> 00:06:57,171
New York's got, what,
10 million people.

76
00:06:57,255 --> 00:06:59,090
- Twelve million.
- Twelve million people.

77
00:06:59,215 --> 00:07:03,594
So obviously there's more crime in New York
than Newport Beach. Proportionately.

78
00:07:03,719 --> 00:07:07,849
What do you get here? Mostly
domestic violence crimes and theft, right?

79
00:07:07,974 --> 00:07:09,892
- Yeah, we get all that stuff.
- I see.

80
00:07:09,976 --> 00:07:13,813
But we get murder,
we get prostitution, we get drugs.

81
00:07:13,896 --> 00:07:15,815
We get all that stuff.

82
00:07:15,898 --> 00:07:20,027
Well, uh, what's the worst
thing you've ever seen?

83
00:07:20,152 --> 00:07:23,489
Would it be that busload of seniors
that went off the cliff?

84
00:07:23,614 --> 00:07:25,491
No, the kids.

85
00:07:25,616 --> 00:07:27,493
Oh, God, yeah. The kids.

86
00:07:27,618 --> 00:07:30,496
All units respond to hijacked red BMW.

87
00:07:30,621 --> 00:07:35,918
1993, California plate 4-nancy-adam-tom-
lincoln-edward-edward.

88
00:07:36,043 --> 00:07:39,463
Male Caucasian, armed and very dangerous,
holding female hostage.

89
00:07:39,589 --> 00:07:42,300
- Vehicle headed south
on Ocean near Magnolia.

90
00:07:42,425 --> 00:07:44,927
Suspect has fired on two officers.
Proceed with caution.

91
00:07:45,052 --> 00:07:48,931
That's us.
This might be your lucky day.

92
00:07:49,056 --> 00:07:52,351
Three-niner at the corner
of Magnolia and Viewcrest.

93
00:07:52,435 --> 00:07:55,938
- In pursuit.
- Let's go get us a bad guy.

94
00:08:01,652 --> 00:08:04,614
I'm burning up in here. Grab the wheel.

95
00:08:08,492 --> 00:08:12,205
Look, I'm gonna let you go
as soon as it's safe.

96
00:08:12,330 --> 00:08:14,248
Just stop making that noise.

97
00:08:14,332 --> 00:08:17,627
I can't help it.

98
00:08:17,752 --> 00:08:20,213
Just let me go.
You can have the car.

99
00:08:20,338 --> 00:08:22,215
Oh, I can have the car.

100
00:08:22,340 --> 00:08:24,217
That's very generous of you.

101
00:08:24,342 --> 00:08:26,385
Let me think here for a minute.

102
00:08:26,511 --> 00:08:29,055
- Please, just let me go.
- I said I would!

103
00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:31,682
Jesus.! Just let me think.

104
00:08:31,766 --> 00:08:34,185
Oh, God.

105
00:08:34,268 --> 00:08:36,687
Listen, you're gonna have to be...

106
00:08:36,771 --> 00:08:39,190
my little insurance policy right now.

107
00:08:40,483 --> 00:08:42,693
If you just hang tough
for a few more minutes...

108
00:08:42,777 --> 00:08:44,403
you're gonna be all right.

109
00:08:44,529 --> 00:08:47,865
- Okay?
- Okay. Okay.

110
00:08:47,949 --> 00:08:49,867
I know what you're thinking.

111
00:08:49,951 --> 00:08:52,203
What rotten timing, huh?

112
00:08:52,286 --> 00:08:55,331
If you hadn't gone in
for that magazine...

113
00:08:55,456 --> 00:08:58,251
I feel exactly the same way.

114
00:08:58,376 --> 00:09:01,671
If I hadn't gone in
for those lousy cigarettes...

115
00:09:01,796 --> 00:09:04,382
This damn habit.
I gotta quit someday.

116
00:09:08,135 --> 00:09:11,013
Very nice set of wheels
you got here. Very nice.

117
00:09:11,138 --> 00:09:14,600
What, you got a phone,
all real leather.

118
00:09:14,725 --> 00:09:17,019
How's a girl like you
able to afford a car like this?

119
00:09:17,144 --> 00:09:19,605
My father gave it to me,
and it's yours if you just let me go.

120
00:09:19,689 --> 00:09:23,192
Your father gave it to you.
Just like that?

121
00:09:23,317 --> 00:09:25,736
Just said,
"Here, take the car. You can have it... "

122
00:09:25,820 --> 00:09:28,948
Goddamn it!

123
00:09:29,031 --> 00:09:32,535
There they are! Hang on!

124
00:09:36,038 --> 00:09:41,544
In pursuit of hijacked red BMW,
southbound on Ocean, just past Horndale.

125
00:09:41,669 --> 00:09:43,254
Request backup immediately.

126
00:09:45,214 --> 00:09:47,633
Aah!

127
00:09:51,095 --> 00:09:53,306
That was stupid!
That was really stupid!

128
00:09:53,431 --> 00:09:56,851
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!
I didn't mean it! I didn't mean it!

129
00:09:56,934 --> 00:10:00,605
You wanna get shot? Rule number one:
you don't burn the guy with the gun.

130
00:10:00,688 --> 00:10:04,108
- All right... Aah! Aah!
- Oh, God, don't kill me.!

131
00:10:04,192 --> 00:10:06,652
- My father'll give you anything you want.!
- Oh, shit! Aah!

132
00:10:10,072 --> 00:10:11,741
Ow! Grab it!
Get the lighter!

133
00:10:16,412 --> 00:10:18,789
Ow! Shit!

134
00:10:20,041 --> 00:10:22,627
Get this lighter... No.!

135
00:10:22,710 --> 00:10:25,630
- What are you doing?
- What? What? What?

136
00:10:25,713 --> 00:10:27,632
You told me to do that!

137
00:10:27,715 --> 00:10:31,427
No, I told you to keep it from burning me,
not throw it out the window!

138
00:10:31,552 --> 00:10:34,514
- Now how the hell am I supposed to smoke?
- I don't know!

139
00:10:40,561 --> 00:10:42,188
This is just what I needed.

140
00:10:45,483 --> 00:10:47,693
Shit!

141
00:10:47,818 --> 00:10:50,530
Oh, God!

142
00:11:13,928 --> 00:11:15,805
- Move! Move!
- Hey!

143
00:11:16,931 --> 00:11:18,683
- Look out!
- Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

144
00:11:22,770 --> 00:11:25,398
Would you watch it!

145
00:11:35,491 --> 00:11:37,910
We don't wanna get
any innocent commuters hurt.

146
00:11:37,994 --> 00:11:41,998
We got a sticky situation. This girl's
relying on us to rescue her safely.

147
00:11:42,123 --> 00:11:44,000
If I let this guy out of my sights...

148
00:11:44,125 --> 00:11:47,086
there's a good possibility
that we will never see her alive again.

149
00:11:54,343 --> 00:11:57,680
If we can get him to a place
where there's a minimum of traffic...

150
00:11:57,805 --> 00:11:59,599
on a back road or something...

151
00:11:59,724 --> 00:12:02,143
we can attempt
to shoot out the tires.

152
00:12:02,226 --> 00:12:04,687
But the abundance of cars here
makes that highly dangerous.

153
00:12:04,812 --> 00:12:09,066
Obviously, you always want to keep vehicular
intercourse down to a minimum at all times.

154
00:12:09,150 --> 00:12:12,778
We don't want this guy spinning out
and hitting a busload of nuns or anything.

155
00:12:37,386 --> 00:12:39,347
Bet you don't get this every day, huh?

156
00:12:39,472 --> 00:12:43,226
Listen, what's the thing you like best
about being cops?

157
00:12:43,351 --> 00:12:48,731
For me, it's the respect and power
that the position commands.

158
00:12:48,856 --> 00:12:53,277
I feel like a combination of Bruce Springsteen
and Sylvester Stallone out there.

159
00:12:53,402 --> 00:12:57,240
I don't know whether I oughta be
bustin'bad guys or signing autographs.

160
00:12:57,365 --> 00:12:59,116
Kinda like being a star.

161
00:13:07,041 --> 00:13:09,460
- I'm gonna throw up.
- What do you mean?

162
00:13:09,544 --> 00:13:11,963
- I feel sick.
- No. Don't you dare.

163
00:13:12,046 --> 00:13:16,467
Don't you dare throw up. Breathe. Take in
some air. Put your head out the window.

164
00:13:16,551 --> 00:13:18,970
Well, don't drive so fast.

165
00:13:19,053 --> 00:13:22,473
Don't drive so fast? What are you, mad?
I'm being chased by the cops!

166
00:13:22,557 --> 00:13:25,977
When you're being chased by cops,
you drive fast. Got it?

167
00:13:26,060 --> 00:13:27,979
Well, I get carsick!

168
00:13:28,062 --> 00:13:31,357
Well, then, put your head out the goddamn
window! What are you waiting for?

169
00:13:33,234 --> 00:13:35,444
She's got her head out the window!
What's she doing?

170
00:13:35,570 --> 00:13:37,446
Maybe she's trying to signal us.

171
00:13:37,572 --> 00:13:40,032
- Can you tell what she's saying?
- No, I can't make her face out clearly.

172
00:13:48,082 --> 00:13:49,500
Oh! She's puking!

173
00:13:49,584 --> 00:13:51,460
- Aah! - Gross!
- Oh, God!

174
00:13:51,586 --> 00:13:55,214
- She's puking.!
- That will never make prime time.

175
00:13:55,298 --> 00:13:57,758
That is a lot of puke.

176
00:13:59,177 --> 00:14:01,179
I can't see a damn thing.

177
00:14:05,474 --> 00:14:07,143
Oh, God.

178
00:14:07,268 --> 00:14:09,520
Guess she wasn't signaling us.

179
00:14:09,604 --> 00:14:12,481
- You okay?
- No.

180
00:14:12,607 --> 00:14:15,443
Do me a favor, will ya.
Chew some gum or something.

181
00:14:15,526 --> 00:14:18,529
Your breath smells
like my grandmother's feet.

182
00:14:18,613 --> 00:14:22,158
Where are the other backups?
We only got one other car here with us.

183
00:14:22,283 --> 00:14:25,453
Unit 39, most units unavailable
due to the funeral...

184
00:14:25,578 --> 00:14:27,622
of Captain Lembeck
in Long Beach.

185
00:14:27,747 --> 00:14:30,416
All remaining available units
should be en route.

186
00:14:30,541 --> 00:14:35,963
If Lembeck knew that his funeral was impeding
a pursuit with hostages, he'd go nuts.

187
00:14:36,047 --> 00:14:40,259
Get those other cops off their cans, will ya?
We're naked out here.

188
00:14:40,343 --> 00:14:46,098
All available units, please respond in
the vicinity of San Remos and Point Vale.

189
00:14:46,182 --> 00:14:48,100
High-speed pursuit in progress.

190
00:14:48,184 --> 00:14:50,603
Red BMW...

191
00:14:50,686 --> 00:14:56,359
license plate number 4-nickel-adam-thomas-
leo-edward-edward.

192
00:14:57,610 --> 00:14:59,445
I do not run my division...

193
00:14:59,529 --> 00:15:01,614
on a shoot first,
ask questions later philosophy!

194
00:15:01,739 --> 00:15:03,950
- Excuse me, sir.
- Can't you see I'm busy?

195
00:15:04,033 --> 00:15:06,786
I think you're gonna want to know
about this right away, sir.

196
00:15:06,869 --> 00:15:09,580
Wejust got a positive I.D. on that red BMW.

197
00:15:09,664 --> 00:15:13,876
Hold on to your beans, sir.
It's registered to a Miss Natalie Nordhoff Voss.

198
00:15:14,001 --> 00:15:15,878
She's the young lady hostage, sir.

199
00:15:16,003 --> 00:15:18,047
So who's Natalie Nordhoff Voss?

200
00:15:18,172 --> 00:15:20,299
Voss, sir, like in Dalton Voss.

201
00:15:20,383 --> 00:15:23,094
No. Not the Dalton Voss.

202
00:15:23,177 --> 00:15:26,097
Are you saying that our hostage
belongs to Dalton Voss?

203
00:15:26,180 --> 00:15:28,474
Yes, sir.
His one and only daughter.

204
00:15:28,558 --> 00:15:30,476
- Holy shit!
- Yes, sir.

205
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:32,478
- How many cars in pursuit?
- Two, sir.

206
00:15:32,562 --> 00:15:35,481
- Two? There oughta be 20! Why are there only two?
- Uh, the funeral, sir.

207
00:15:35,565 --> 00:15:38,234
- A third car is on its way.
- Three stinking little cars.

208
00:15:38,359 --> 00:15:41,237
- Where's our chopper?
- We loaned it to that film company, sir.

209
00:15:41,362 --> 00:15:44,240
- Well, why the hell did we do that?
- You approved it, sir.

210
00:15:44,365 --> 00:15:48,244
We haven't needed to use the chopper
since that Marin County brush fire, sir.

211
00:15:48,369 --> 00:15:51,789
This is a fine how-do-you-do.
Get that chopper back now!

212
00:15:55,543 --> 00:15:57,420
Now, who's Natalie Voss?

213
00:15:57,545 --> 00:15:59,338
Only Dalton Voss's daughter.

214
00:15:59,463 --> 00:16:01,883
Dalton Voss
is the Donald Trump of California.

215
00:16:01,966 --> 00:16:05,178
One of the richest men in America.
You guys really struck gold tonight, huh?

216
00:16:28,993 --> 00:16:31,704
Well, I gotta do what I gotta do.
Get down to Mexico much?

217
00:16:31,829 --> 00:16:33,748
- No. Why?
- 'Cause that's where we're headed.

218
00:16:33,831 --> 00:16:35,750
I wasn't planning on company, but...

219
00:16:35,833 --> 00:16:37,752
Oh, my God! Mexico?

220
00:16:37,835 --> 00:16:40,755
Oh, God, just stop the car and let me go!
Just let me out!

221
00:16:40,838 --> 00:16:43,299
You are really starting
to get on my nerves.

222
00:16:43,424 --> 00:16:46,385
I'm in a bit of a bind here, so put on
your seat belt. We're getting on the freeway.

223
00:17:15,122 --> 00:17:18,209
Shit! This is bad!
This is really bad!

224
00:17:18,292 --> 00:17:20,711
Oh, I can't say the "S" word
on TV, can I?

225
00:17:20,795 --> 00:17:22,713
- It's cool. We'll bleep it.
- All right, yeah.

226
00:17:22,797 --> 00:17:24,715
Why is this so "bad"?

227
00:17:24,799 --> 00:17:29,387
Taking the chase on the freeway heightens
the stakes. It complicates things greatly.

228
00:17:29,470 --> 00:17:31,097
This guy's really pissing me off!

229
00:17:37,895 --> 00:17:39,939
Shit.

230
00:17:59,959 --> 00:18:03,880
And if you're traveling
along the 5 into L. A...

231
00:18:04,005 --> 00:18:08,384
there's a slight bottleneck
along theJohn Wayne northbound.

232
00:18:08,509 --> 00:18:12,805
Yeah, it seems an overturned gravel truck
on the shoulder is causing some slowing.

233
00:18:12,930 --> 00:18:16,017
Other than that,
it's a pretty good commute into the n...

234
00:18:16,142 --> 00:18:18,811
Whoa.! Wait a second.!
Wait a second.!

235
00:18:18,936 --> 00:18:22,440
I think we got a situation developing
on the southbound lane.

236
00:18:22,523 --> 00:18:25,526
Yes, it appears we're
picking up a high-speed pursuit.

237
00:18:25,610 --> 00:18:28,029
Bill and Wendy,
do you see this in the studio?

238
00:18:28,112 --> 00:18:30,031
Yes, Byron, we surely do.

239
00:18:30,114 --> 00:18:33,659
It does appear as though we're watching
a high-speed chase unfold live.

240
00:18:33,743 --> 00:18:37,121
Bill, I'm gonna follow this late-breaking
story, see if we can get a little bit closer.

241
00:18:37,205 --> 00:18:41,918
Uh, Andy, uh, take it down a little bit
and see if you can stay with the red car.

242
00:18:44,212 --> 00:18:47,340
Three Newport Beach police cars
are taking every precaution...

243
00:18:47,423 --> 00:18:50,343
so as not to cause
any kind of traffic accident.

244
00:18:50,426 --> 00:18:53,971
They seem to be following at a safe distance
behind what appears to be...

245
00:18:54,055 --> 00:18:56,349
a late-model BMW.

246
00:18:56,432 --> 00:18:58,809
Oh, yeah.
They're after this guy, all right.

247
00:18:58,893 --> 00:19:00,895
He must've done something.

248
00:19:06,484 --> 00:19:08,945
Whoa! Ho!
Did you see that?

249
00:19:15,159 --> 00:19:17,078
Oh, n...
Watch out. Watch out.

250
00:19:19,163 --> 00:19:20,832
Holy mackerel!

251
00:19:20,915 --> 00:19:25,044
That medical school truck is spilling out
cadavers all along the freeway.!

252
00:19:25,127 --> 00:19:27,046
That's repugnant.!

253
00:19:27,129 --> 00:19:29,549
Gross!

254
00:19:41,352 --> 00:19:43,896
Aaah! Get it off!

255
00:19:44,021 --> 00:19:46,524
Jeez!

256
00:19:46,607 --> 00:19:49,861
Get it off!

257
00:19:51,612 --> 00:19:53,531
Eeeww!

258
00:19:53,614 --> 00:19:55,533
Now, that's disgusting.

259
00:19:55,616 --> 00:19:58,035
I'll say.
Stay with him, Byron.

260
00:19:58,119 --> 00:20:00,037
We're going to try to get
some more information...

261
00:20:00,121 --> 00:20:02,039
from the Newport Beach
Police Department...

262
00:20:02,123 --> 00:20:06,043
on this fast-breaking, exclusive
Channel 8 high-speed chase in progress.

263
00:20:08,212 --> 00:20:10,047
Oh, no! God!
Oh, my God!

264
00:20:10,131 --> 00:20:13,134
Jesus! What are you trying to do,
give me a heart attack?

265
00:20:13,217 --> 00:20:16,137
Rule number one
is no loud screaming.

266
00:20:16,220 --> 00:20:19,140
I thought rule number one was
no burning the guy with the gun.

267
00:20:19,223 --> 00:20:22,143
You might just be a little too feisty
for your own good.

268
00:20:22,226 --> 00:20:25,146
Christ. Okay, rule number two is
no loud screaming.

269
00:20:25,229 --> 00:20:27,148
Stop waving that thing in my face.

270
00:20:27,231 --> 00:20:30,651
Am I holding the gun in your face?
I don't think so.

271
00:20:30,735 --> 00:20:33,779
You know, I can be a pretty likable guy
when I'm not pointing a gun at somebody.

272
00:20:33,905 --> 00:20:36,824
I know you don't believe me,
but it's true. You gotta trust me.

273
00:20:40,745 --> 00:20:45,291
Aw, shit! Why do things
always go so wrong for me?

274
00:20:45,416 --> 00:20:48,127
- Maybe you bring it on yourself.
- Maybe you don't know what you're talking about!

275
00:20:48,211 --> 00:20:49,879
- Maybe I do.
- Maybe you're a brat.

276
00:20:50,004 --> 00:20:52,798
Maybe I am.
Please just stop and let me out.

277
00:20:52,882 --> 00:20:56,302
- I promise I won't let them shoot you.
- Oh, you won't. That's nice.

278
00:20:56,385 --> 00:20:59,305
I appreciate that,
but I can't do that. Not yet.

279
00:20:59,388 --> 00:21:02,308
So, seeing that we're gonna be traveling
companions for a while...

280
00:21:02,391 --> 00:21:04,352
I thought we should
get better acquainted.

281
00:21:04,477 --> 00:21:06,312
My name is Jack.
And you are?

282
00:21:06,437 --> 00:21:08,648
- You can't do this.
- Do what?

283
00:21:08,773 --> 00:21:10,858
This.! You c...

284
00:21:10,983 --> 00:21:13,861
You can't just kidnap somebody
and threaten to kill them...

285
00:21:13,986 --> 00:21:16,364
and then expect them
to be cute and nice.

286
00:21:16,489 --> 00:21:19,784
- Why not?
- You just can't. Okay? It doesn't work that way.

287
00:21:19,867 --> 00:21:23,412
You are a terrorist.
Why should I be nice back to you?

288
00:21:23,538 --> 00:21:25,414
All right, first of all,
I am not a terrorist.

289
00:21:25,540 --> 00:21:29,669
Terrorists have ratty beards
and blow up airports.

290
00:21:29,794 --> 00:21:32,296
Secondly, there are no rules
on how to kidnap people.

291
00:21:32,421 --> 00:21:34,340
There's no rule that says
you can't be cordial and nice.

292
00:21:34,423 --> 00:21:38,344
And quite frankly, for my first time out,
I think I'm doing a hell of a job.

293
00:21:38,427 --> 00:21:42,515
- Now tell me your name!
- Only if you get rid of the gun. It scares me.

294
00:21:42,598 --> 00:21:45,184
Oh, right. I'll do that, you'll do
something stupid, I'll crash the car.

295
00:21:45,309 --> 00:21:47,937
- I don't think so.
- I'm not gonna do anything stupid.

296
00:21:48,062 --> 00:21:50,940
I just... I... I hate guns.

297
00:21:54,402 --> 00:21:56,654
There? Are you satisfied?

298
00:21:56,737 --> 00:21:58,865
- I'm only doing that to ease your mind.
- Thank you.

299
00:21:58,990 --> 00:22:02,326
Now, as I said before, my name is Jack.
And you are?

300
00:22:02,410 --> 00:22:05,037
Natalie. Natalie Voss.

301
00:22:05,121 --> 00:22:07,498
Natalie Voss.

302
00:22:07,582 --> 00:22:09,500
That's nice.

303
00:22:09,584 --> 00:22:12,003
What, are you related
to Dalton Voss or something?

304
00:22:12,086 --> 00:22:15,548
- He's my father.
- Yeah, right. Get out.

305
00:22:19,302 --> 00:22:21,554
I- It was a joke. I was joking.

306
00:22:21,637 --> 00:22:23,306
I wasn't.

307
00:22:23,431 --> 00:22:28,311
This is insane. You're Dalton Voss's daughter?
The Dalton Voss?

308
00:22:28,436 --> 00:22:31,314
Do you have any idea
how goddamn rich that man is?

309
00:22:31,439 --> 00:22:33,316
Yes, thank you very much.

310
00:22:33,441 --> 00:22:36,485
He is my father,
as if you didn't know.

311
00:22:38,613 --> 00:22:40,489
As if I didn't know.

312
00:22:40,615 --> 00:22:42,492
- What?
- I just... This just...

313
00:22:42,617 --> 00:22:44,494
This just sucks! It sucks!

314
00:22:44,619 --> 00:22:48,498
Because now they're gonna think I kidnapped
you because you're Dalton Voss's daughter.

315
00:22:48,623 --> 00:22:50,917
Why me?
Why me?

316
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,419
I go in for some cigarettes
and a tank of gas...

317
00:22:53,503 --> 00:22:56,047
and I wind up kidnapping
the daughter of Dalton Voss.

318
00:22:56,130 --> 00:22:58,966
- What are the odds?
- I would say pretty good.

319
00:22:59,091 --> 00:23:01,677
- You were probably stalking me.
- Don't flatter yourself, kid.

320
00:23:01,802 --> 00:23:04,263
- I was just passing through town.
- A likely story.

321
00:23:04,347 --> 00:23:06,557
Jesus, you are a brat.

322
00:23:08,809 --> 00:23:11,187
This just in from the Newport Beach Police.

323
00:23:11,312 --> 00:23:13,689
The owner of the BMW
has been identified...

324
00:23:13,814 --> 00:23:17,693
as Miss Natalie Voss, daughter of
millionaire industrialist Dalton Voss.

325
00:23:17,818 --> 00:23:20,696
Police speculate the gunman
followed Miss Voss...

326
00:23:20,821 --> 00:23:23,699
with the intent
of kidnapping her for ransom.

327
00:23:23,825 --> 00:23:27,745
Well, it certainly is obvious, Wendy,
that this kidnapping was no happenstance.

328
00:23:27,870 --> 00:23:30,790
As you can see, police are taking
a more aggressive position...

329
00:23:30,873 --> 00:23:32,792
tailing very close behind the BMW.

330
00:23:32,875 --> 00:23:35,336
Shit.

331
00:23:41,843 --> 00:23:43,761
Mr. Voss. Mrs. Voss.

332
00:23:43,845 --> 00:23:47,056
I want you to know, as far as we can
ascertain your daughter is perfectly safe.

333
00:23:47,181 --> 00:23:48,766
"Perfectly safe"?

334
00:23:48,850 --> 00:23:51,602
She's being held hostage in the middle
of a goddamn high-speed chase!

335
00:23:51,686 --> 00:23:53,437
How can you say
she's perfectly safe?

336
00:23:53,521 --> 00:23:56,732
If she were perfectly safe, she'd be at home,
locked up, where she belongs!

337
00:23:56,858 --> 00:23:59,485
Unharmed, sir, is what I meant.
Uh, perfectly unharmed.

338
00:23:59,610 --> 00:24:01,487
Our officers are in diligent pursuit.

339
00:24:01,612 --> 00:24:04,115
Oh, poor little Nattie
in her brand-new car.

340
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:07,201
You look here, Boyle.
Stop trying to give me this bullshit!

341
00:24:07,285 --> 00:24:09,996
It was your incompetent officers that
allowed all this to happen in the first place!

342
00:24:10,121 --> 00:24:12,039
I want my daughter
out of this jeopardy now!

343
00:24:12,123 --> 00:24:15,251
I can assure you, Mr. Voss, my main concern
is your daughter's safety.

344
00:24:15,376 --> 00:24:17,837
C.H.P. has been notified and will be
providing assistance from...

345
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:20,882
Just do your goddamn job
the right way for a change. All right?

346
00:24:20,965 --> 00:24:24,677
Okay, okay, be cool, Jack. Don't panic.
Don't panic. Think, think, think, think.

347
00:24:24,802 --> 00:24:27,722
Breathe. Things are
way out of control!

348
00:24:27,805 --> 00:24:29,724
You did not actually kidnap anyone.

349
00:24:29,807 --> 00:24:32,351
Oh, well, in case you've forgotten,
you kidnapped me!

350
00:24:32,476 --> 00:24:34,896
I mean, I didn't intend
to kidnap anyone.

351
00:24:34,979 --> 00:24:36,898
Pardon me,
but is there a difference?

352
00:24:36,981 --> 00:24:39,358
Well, of course
there's a difference, you moron!

353
00:24:39,483 --> 00:24:43,154
Intent means you planned something.
I didn't plan anything!

354
00:24:43,237 --> 00:24:47,533
Oh, so somebody held a gun to your head
and made you hold a gun to my head!

355
00:24:47,658 --> 00:24:49,619
In a way, yes.

356
00:24:53,831 --> 00:24:57,043
God, it's filthy in here.

357
00:24:57,126 --> 00:24:59,045
What's that stink?

358
00:25:05,468 --> 00:25:07,428
Step right over here, please.

359
00:25:08,471 --> 00:25:10,389
Give it to me quick, Patterson.

360
00:25:10,473 --> 00:25:12,433
We got a beautiful shot, full on.

361
00:25:12,517 --> 00:25:15,228
Right... now.

362
00:25:15,353 --> 00:25:18,689
Let's see if I can get closer.

363
00:25:20,316 --> 00:25:22,235
Look at his eyes.

364
00:25:22,318 --> 00:25:24,904
- Chilling.
- Yeah.

365
00:25:25,029 --> 00:25:26,948
So, who in the hell is he?

366
00:25:32,787 --> 00:25:35,915
Uh, name:
Hammond, Jackson Davis. Age: 28.

367
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:40,002
"Escaped guards while being transferred from
San Francisco CountyJail to San Quentin...

368
00:25:40,127 --> 00:25:43,256
after being sentenced
for a 1991 armed bank robbery. "

369
00:25:43,339 --> 00:25:45,424
Hammond? Let me see that.

370
00:25:46,843 --> 00:25:49,053
We were notified yesterday
he might be headed for Mexico.

371
00:25:49,136 --> 00:25:54,225
You were notified yesterday and you did
nothing? What kind of place is this?

372
00:25:54,308 --> 00:25:58,563
Mr. Voss, I stress, we were alerted he...
he might be headed this way.

373
00:25:58,646 --> 00:26:01,566
He could have been headed
for Vegas or Utah just as easily.

374
00:26:01,649 --> 00:26:04,569
- We're cops, not mind readers.
- Maybe you're not, but I am.

375
00:26:04,652 --> 00:26:07,572
And I can see quite clearly you're gonna be
looking for a new goddamn job...

376
00:26:07,655 --> 00:26:10,283
if one hair on my daughter's head
is harmed!

377
00:26:10,366 --> 00:26:12,702
Do you hear me?
One hair.!

378
00:26:12,827 --> 00:26:16,956
- Get this out in the field.
- Take his picture off that monitor! I don't wanna see it!

379
00:26:17,081 --> 00:26:20,459
Attention, all units
in pursuit of red BMW.

380
00:26:20,585 --> 00:26:25,590
Kidnapper identified as
Jackson Davis Hammond, age 28.

381
00:26:25,673 --> 00:26:29,051
Escaped prisoner
convicted of armed bank robbery.

382
00:26:29,177 --> 00:26:32,555
Shit! Goddamn bastard!

383
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:34,557
He's desperate.
This is really bad.

384
00:26:34,682 --> 00:26:36,559
Things could get really messy now.

385
00:26:36,684 --> 00:26:38,769
An escaped con.!
This is great.!

386
00:26:38,853 --> 00:26:41,981
Real-life human drama
at its nitty-gritty best.

387
00:26:42,064 --> 00:26:47,153
We've been keeping a lookout, but you never know
where a creep like this is gonna pop up next.

388
00:26:53,117 --> 00:26:55,828
We're going in close
on the driver's side!

389
00:26:55,953 --> 00:26:57,830
This guy's a lunatic!

390
00:26:57,955 --> 00:27:00,791
We'll flank him on the passenger side,
squeeze him in.

391
00:27:06,297 --> 00:27:08,132
Shit.!

392
00:27:08,216 --> 00:27:11,677
- What? What?
- This has just gotten way too hairy.

393
00:27:13,304 --> 00:27:15,806
- What do you mean, "hairy"?
- I mean hairy.!

394
00:27:15,890 --> 00:27:18,309
This is too good.

395
00:27:19,769 --> 00:27:22,605
Whoa!

396
00:27:27,068 --> 00:27:29,654
- Holy Christ!
- Get that.! Get that.!

397
00:27:33,825 --> 00:27:36,828
Oh, my God!
Did you see that?

398
00:27:36,953 --> 00:27:40,414
Those vehicles tumbled across
the freeway like Matchbox cars.!

399
00:27:40,540 --> 00:27:42,500
This is truly dramatic footage.!

400
00:27:42,625 --> 00:27:46,170
Byron, was that a gunshot we saw
come out of the driver's side window?

401
00:27:46,254 --> 00:27:48,673
Yes!
Yes, that's affirmative, Wendy!

402
00:27:48,756 --> 00:27:53,886
It appears the assailant shot out the tires
on the cop car, causing the catastrophe.

403
00:27:54,011 --> 00:27:58,266
This guy must be a sharpshooter to have
such impeccable aim at such high speeds.

404
00:27:58,391 --> 00:28:00,351
Possibly an ex-marine.

405
00:28:00,476 --> 00:28:02,395
Holy shit.

406
00:28:02,478 --> 00:28:05,439
Did you see him flip over?
I didn't mean to do that.

407
00:28:05,523 --> 00:28:10,236
Well, what do you think is gonna happen when
you shoot a tire out at 80 miles an hour?

408
00:28:10,361 --> 00:28:13,823
I- I don't know. It just went off.
I didn't mean to shoot him.

409
00:28:13,948 --> 00:28:16,826
What were you gonna do,
squirt water at him?

410
00:28:16,951 --> 00:28:18,828
Shut up for a minute
and let me think!

411
00:28:18,953 --> 00:28:21,831
Your voice is cutting
through my brain like nails.

412
00:28:21,956 --> 00:28:23,833
What's that supposed to mean?

413
00:28:23,958 --> 00:28:25,835
What, I have a shrilly voice?

414
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:28,337
Excuse me for not being
the perfect hostage.

415
00:28:28,462 --> 00:28:30,339
I said shut up!

416
00:28:30,464 --> 00:28:33,843
This whole thing
has gotten way too violent.

417
00:28:33,968 --> 00:28:35,845
I... I h... I hate violence.

418
00:28:35,970 --> 00:28:37,597
You hate violence?

419
00:28:37,722 --> 00:28:40,266
You are the epitome of violence!

420
00:28:40,391 --> 00:28:44,812
You're a gun-wielding, cop-shooting,
maniac kidnapper. Now, that's violent.

421
00:28:44,896 --> 00:28:46,772
No, I am not!

422
00:28:46,898 --> 00:28:49,275
Don't tell me what I am when you
don't know a damn thing about me!

423
00:28:49,358 --> 00:28:53,112
There is a difference in being violent
and being driven to violence!

424
00:28:53,237 --> 00:28:55,364
I am not a violent man.

425
00:28:55,490 --> 00:28:57,450
God!

426
00:28:59,327 --> 00:29:03,247
- Well, then what are you?
- I'll make it simple for you. All right?

427
00:29:03,331 --> 00:29:05,833
I was convicted of a crime
I did not commit.

428
00:29:05,917 --> 00:29:08,794
The system does not believe me.
Why should I expect you to?

429
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:10,796
That's who I am.

430
00:29:10,922 --> 00:29:13,799
- You're right. I don't believe you.
- Well, there you go.

431
00:29:13,925 --> 00:29:15,801
What kind of a crime?

432
00:29:15,968 --> 00:29:18,137
What is that? What's that noise?

433
00:29:18,262 --> 00:29:20,139
The phone.

434
00:29:20,264 --> 00:29:23,476
Not a word out of you.

435
00:29:23,601 --> 00:29:25,811
- What the hell?
- Press the "send" button.

436
00:29:25,895 --> 00:29:28,439
Hello.

437
00:29:28,523 --> 00:29:31,442
Jackson Hammond?
Chief Boyle, Newport Beach.

438
00:29:31,526 --> 00:29:34,445
Son, why don't you pull over
to the side and let the girl go.

439
00:29:34,529 --> 00:29:37,448
What do you say
we end this fiasco right now?

440
00:29:37,532 --> 00:29:39,492
I promise to help you any way I can.

441
00:29:39,575 --> 00:29:41,494
Nothing doing, Chief.

442
00:29:41,577 --> 00:29:43,996
I don't give a damn
about your hollow promises.

443
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:46,999
- I've listened to empty hype for two years.
- For God's sake, Hammond.!

444
00:29:47,083 --> 00:29:49,961
Aren't you in enough trouble?
What's this gonna prove?

445
00:29:50,044 --> 00:29:54,090
There's no escape.
Just let the girl go before she gets hurt.

446
00:29:54,215 --> 00:29:56,092
The girl is not gonna get hurt...

447
00:29:56,217 --> 00:29:58,970
if you tell your officers
to get off my back.

448
00:29:59,053 --> 00:30:02,515
- I can't do that.
- Get out of my way! Let me talk!

449
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:06,102
- Jackson Hammond, this is Dalton Voss.
- Daddy, help me! Do something!

450
00:30:06,227 --> 00:30:09,522
If you harm my daughter, I'll kill you myself,
you stinking son of a bitch!

451
00:30:09,647 --> 00:30:12,024
- You hear me?
- Tell him you're fine. Do it.

452
00:30:12,149 --> 00:30:14,318
Natalie?

453
00:30:14,402 --> 00:30:16,320
I'm fine.

454
00:30:16,404 --> 00:30:18,865
There. You hear that? She's fine.

455
00:30:18,948 --> 00:30:21,993
Well, Dalton Voss.
This is truly an honor.

456
00:30:22,076 --> 00:30:24,203
Okay, Hammond, cut the crap.

457
00:30:24,287 --> 00:30:27,248
- How much do you want?
- How much what do I want?

458
00:30:27,331 --> 00:30:28,958
Money, you asshole.

459
00:30:29,083 --> 00:30:31,878
I don't want to pander to you.
Just tell me how much you want, and it's yours.

460
00:30:32,003 --> 00:30:36,382
That's very kind, Mr. Voss, but I'm really
not interested in your goddamn money.

461
00:30:36,465 --> 00:30:39,385
Of course he's interested in your money.
What else could he want?

462
00:30:39,468 --> 00:30:41,429
Don't make me lose
my patience, Hammond.

463
00:30:42,471 --> 00:30:44,223
Fifty thousand dollars.

464
00:30:44,307 --> 00:30:47,852
Fifty thousand dollars?
That's all your daughter's worth to you?

465
00:30:47,935 --> 00:30:50,396
You're a billionaire.!
That's pathetic.!

466
00:30:50,479 --> 00:30:53,941
All right, fine.
A hundred thousand dollars, then?

467
00:30:54,025 --> 00:30:55,902
What the hell do you want?

468
00:30:56,027 --> 00:30:57,904
An airplane? What?

469
00:30:58,029 --> 00:31:00,364
I don't want your money.
I don't want your planes.

470
00:31:00,448 --> 00:31:03,367
- Come on.! I didn'tjust fall off a turnip truck.
- Must've been a yam wagon.

471
00:31:03,451 --> 00:31:05,495
Your pop's got a good sense of humor.

472
00:31:05,620 --> 00:31:07,497
Let me talk to my daughter.

473
00:31:07,622 --> 00:31:10,333
- Nattie, honey?
- I'm here.

474
00:31:10,458 --> 00:31:13,753
Your father and I will get you out of this,
no matter what it costs.

475
00:31:13,836 --> 00:31:17,006
Understand? Be brave, darling.

476
00:31:17,131 --> 00:31:20,510
That man isn't trying
anything... funny, is he?

477
00:31:21,844 --> 00:31:24,514
No, Yvonne. He isn't
trying anything "funny. "

478
00:31:24,639 --> 00:31:26,766
Natalie, your mother and I...

479
00:31:26,849 --> 00:31:29,268
- Stepmother!
- Natalie, don't start.

480
00:31:29,352 --> 00:31:31,270
Well, she isn't my mother, is she?

481
00:31:31,354 --> 00:31:35,775
Can we not go through this now? I'm being
held hostage in a speeding car. Remember?

482
00:31:35,858 --> 00:31:39,278
Don't smart-mouth me.
You have put me in a very touchy situation.

483
00:31:39,362 --> 00:31:42,031
I'm supposed to be on a plane for Paris,
for Christ's sake.!

484
00:31:42,156 --> 00:31:45,576
- Sorry, Daddy.
- I swear, I don't know what's gotten into you.

485
00:31:45,701 --> 00:31:47,620
It's been one headache after another.

486
00:31:47,703 --> 00:31:51,415
What is your problem? I've tried to
give you everything you want.

487
00:31:51,499 --> 00:31:53,709
She takes you for granted, Dalton.
She's spoiled.

488
00:31:53,835 --> 00:31:57,421
Hey, hey, hey!
What's the matter with you people?

489
00:31:57,505 --> 00:32:01,968
Your daughter is going through a crisis right
now and does not need to be berated like this!

490
00:32:02,093 --> 00:32:05,096
- You listen to me, Hammond...
- No! You listen to me, Dalt!

491
00:32:06,222 --> 00:32:08,140
Who talks to their daughter that way?

492
00:32:08,224 --> 00:32:09,976
You oughta be ashamed of yourself.

493
00:32:10,101 --> 00:32:13,312
She's obviously fallen into
an unfortunate situation here...

494
00:32:13,437 --> 00:32:15,606
and could usejust
a little bit of compassion.!

495
00:32:15,690 --> 00:32:18,901
You think about it, asshole.

496
00:32:19,026 --> 00:32:22,405
No offense, but what a dickhead.

497
00:32:22,530 --> 00:32:24,824
Tell me about it.

498
00:32:24,949 --> 00:32:26,868
Hammond? Hammond?

499
00:32:26,951 --> 00:32:28,870
Goddamn it!

500
00:32:28,953 --> 00:32:33,082
As we continue our exclusive Channel 8
coverage, looks like help is on the way.

501
00:32:33,207 --> 00:32:37,253
Three C.H.P. cars
and two C.H.P. cycles...

502
00:32:37,378 --> 00:32:41,007
have just joined the Newport Beach Police
in pursuit of the BMW.

503
00:32:42,383 --> 00:32:45,469
So far this guy has managed to evade...

504
00:32:45,553 --> 00:32:47,471
the police's every attempt
to put an end...

505
00:32:47,555 --> 00:32:50,933
to this heinous,
runaway-train scenario.

506
00:32:51,058 --> 00:32:55,229
It never ceases to amaze me how many
people try and run from the cops.

507
00:32:55,354 --> 00:32:57,231
I mean, what are they thinking?

508
00:32:57,356 --> 00:32:59,984
Ehh! Hello?
I'm gonna outrun a policeman!

509
00:33:00,067 --> 00:33:03,654
What's going on in their tiny minds?
Do they really think they're gonna get away?

510
00:33:03,738 --> 00:33:06,866
Like take this Hammond guy.
We're gonna nail him!

511
00:33:06,991 --> 00:33:10,453
This is a special edition
of Channel 8 News at 6:00.

512
00:33:10,578 --> 00:33:14,749
Tonight, Terror on the Freeway!

513
00:33:25,927 --> 00:33:27,887
Good evening.
I'm Bill Cromwell.

514
00:33:27,970 --> 00:33:30,806
If you've just joined us,
tonight there's terror on the freeway.

515
00:33:30,932 --> 00:33:34,602
As we follow live with exclusive coverage
from Skycopter 8...

516
00:33:34,727 --> 00:33:37,605
a high-speed chase is now in progress.

517
00:33:37,730 --> 00:33:41,692
Channel 8 News has learned that Newport
Beach millionaire Dalton Voss's daughter...

518
00:33:41,776 --> 00:33:43,694
Natalie Voss...

519
00:33:43,778 --> 00:33:47,990
is being held hostage by this man,
Jackson Davis Hammond.

520
00:33:48,115 --> 00:33:50,034
- Wendy?
- Jack?

521
00:33:50,117 --> 00:33:52,662
Jackson Hammond, also known
as the red-nosed robber...

522
00:33:52,787 --> 00:33:55,248
was scheduled to begin serving
a 25-year prison sentence...

523
00:33:55,331 --> 00:33:57,875
for an armed bank robbery in 1991...

524
00:33:57,959 --> 00:34:00,002
before he escaped just 24 hours ago.

525
00:34:00,127 --> 00:34:02,004
- Oh, Jack.
- Sounds pretty serious, Bill.

526
00:34:02,129 --> 00:34:04,090
How right you are, Wendy.

527
00:34:04,173 --> 00:34:06,634
Police are mum on Hammond's
specific ransom demands...

528
00:34:06,759 --> 00:34:09,220
obviously trying to
negotiate a safe end...

529
00:34:09,303 --> 00:34:12,056
to this horrific saga for Miss Voss.

530
00:34:12,139 --> 00:34:14,016
Jack, you idiot.

531
00:34:20,773 --> 00:34:23,192
Look at all those cops.

532
00:34:23,317 --> 00:34:26,737
Nobody has ever talked that way
to my father before.

533
00:34:26,863 --> 00:34:30,241
That's because everybody wants
something from him, including you.

534
00:34:30,324 --> 00:34:33,703
- Me? I don't want anything from my father.
- Sure, you do.

535
00:34:33,828 --> 00:34:36,789
- Like what?
- Like love, for instance. Respect.

536
00:34:36,914 --> 00:34:39,292
To be treated
like a human being, like a woman.

537
00:34:39,417 --> 00:34:42,712
Not like some baby girl, which is
obviously how he still sees you.

538
00:34:42,837 --> 00:34:45,590
- Am I right?
- Maybe.

539
00:34:45,673 --> 00:34:47,967
I think I'm right.

540
00:34:48,050 --> 00:34:51,929
There's a big responsibility
to being Dalton Voss's daughter.

541
00:34:52,013 --> 00:34:54,807
I never asked to be born
to Dalton Voss.

542
00:34:54,891 --> 00:34:57,268
I just want to be like everybody else.

543
00:34:57,351 --> 00:35:02,148
- That's not a hundred percent true.
- Yes, it is.

544
00:35:02,231 --> 00:35:05,902
You mean, you'd rather be driving around
in a primered, used Chevy Nova...

545
00:35:06,027 --> 00:35:07,904
than this brand-new BMW?

546
00:35:08,029 --> 00:35:11,157
- Get real.
- It really wouldn't matter to me.

547
00:35:11,240 --> 00:35:13,409
- Whatever.
- It's true.

548
00:35:13,534 --> 00:35:16,954
Once you've had money all of your life,
it's not that big of a deal anymore.

549
00:35:17,038 --> 00:35:21,501
Hey, honey, when you don't have money
all your life, it's a very big deal.

550
00:35:26,214 --> 00:35:29,342
You guys ever been
on a chase this long before?

551
00:35:29,425 --> 00:35:32,094
Are you kidding?
We go on chases all the time.

552
00:35:32,220 --> 00:35:35,181
- Never this long though.
- Not this long, exactly.

553
00:35:35,264 --> 00:35:37,517
But yeah, we go on a lot of chases.

554
00:35:39,352 --> 00:35:41,771
Do you ever get scared?

555
00:35:41,896 --> 00:35:44,774
- This... This is off the record, right?
- Of course.

556
00:35:44,899 --> 00:35:46,776
Scared shitless.

557
00:35:46,901 --> 00:35:50,029
- We're no wimps though.
- No, I'm not saying we're wimps.

558
00:35:50,112 --> 00:35:52,198
It's just that...

559
00:35:52,323 --> 00:35:54,534
We're just people, like everybody else.

560
00:35:54,617 --> 00:35:57,870
Well, obviously we're people.
Standard issue street soldiers.

561
00:35:58,037 --> 00:36:01,874
Standard issue street soldiers.

562
00:36:01,958 --> 00:36:06,629
- That's a great tag line.
- Thanks. Came up with that myself.

563
00:36:08,256 --> 00:36:10,174
So why do you hate your stepmom?

564
00:36:10,258 --> 00:36:12,343
What makes you think I do?

565
00:36:13,970 --> 00:36:16,764
- Just a hunch.
- She's a twit.

566
00:36:16,889 --> 00:36:20,643
She obviously married my father for
his money, but he's too stupid to notice.

567
00:36:20,768 --> 00:36:24,397
She tries to control everything
and everybody, but she can't control me.

568
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:26,399
Sounds like chaos.

569
00:36:26,482 --> 00:36:30,945
I should have gone away to college.
Then I wouldn't have to listen to their bitching.

570
00:36:31,070 --> 00:36:33,406
What about your real mom?

571
00:36:33,531 --> 00:36:35,408
She lives in L.A.

572
00:36:35,533 --> 00:36:38,244
Don't tell me.
You don't like her either, right?

573
00:36:38,327 --> 00:36:41,706
No, I do. It's just that...

574
00:36:42,999 --> 00:36:46,294
She'd rather be my best friend than my mom.

575
00:36:46,419 --> 00:36:49,589
God, I get so frustrated,
I just wanna do something.

576
00:36:49,714 --> 00:36:52,216
- Like what?
- I don't know. Something.!

577
00:36:52,341 --> 00:36:54,927
Something other than what
I'm supposed to do.

578
00:37:03,895 --> 00:37:06,647
If you look now, you'll see
how people are just opening up...

579
00:37:06,772 --> 00:37:08,649
allowing this car to pass freely.

580
00:37:08,774 --> 00:37:11,444
It's amazing that this far
the police haven't been able to stop him.

581
00:37:11,569 --> 00:37:14,822
Oh, wonderful. Here comes the circus.

582
00:37:14,947 --> 00:37:16,908
What is she doing here?

583
00:37:18,326 --> 00:37:21,245
I happen to be
the girl's mother, thank you.

584
00:37:21,329 --> 00:37:23,831
- How's my baby?
- She seems just fine, Mrs. Voss.

585
00:37:23,915 --> 00:37:26,918
- We're doing everything we can.
- Ha. That's a laugh.

586
00:37:27,001 --> 00:37:30,046
What's the matter, Dalton? Haven't you
been able to buy things right this time?

587
00:37:30,171 --> 00:37:31,964
Dalton, don't listen to that.

588
00:37:32,048 --> 00:37:35,384
- The truth hurts, doesn't it?
- Frances, I am not in the mood.

589
00:37:35,510 --> 00:37:38,095
Dalton, you were never in the mood.

590
00:37:38,179 --> 00:37:40,473
- I never!
- I never did either, married to him.

591
00:37:40,598 --> 00:37:44,810
Folks, come on now. I know this tension
is unsettling, but please.

592
00:37:44,936 --> 00:37:48,564
This bickering amongst yourselves
doesn't get us anything.

593
00:37:48,689 --> 00:37:52,610
- Hodges, get the Vosses and Mr., uh...
- MacEnernie.

594
00:37:52,735 --> 00:37:55,279
- MacEnernie some coffee.
- Yes, sir.

595
00:37:57,031 --> 00:37:59,951
Chief, there's a Mr. AriJosephson
on the phone.

596
00:38:00,034 --> 00:38:03,037
- He's Hammond's attorney from San Francisco.
- Why didn't you come get me?

597
00:38:08,459 --> 00:38:10,586
This is Chief Boyle.
Talk to me.

598
00:38:10,711 --> 00:38:13,214
Chief, this is Ari Josephson.
I'm Jackson Hammond's attorney.

599
00:38:13,339 --> 00:38:16,175
I just now found out about the predicament
my client got into down there.

600
00:38:16,300 --> 00:38:20,471
I think I can help. If I could just talk to him,
I think I can get him to listen to reason.

601
00:38:20,555 --> 00:38:22,932
- He listens to me.
- Do what you gotta do.

602
00:38:23,057 --> 00:38:26,853
Only get him to let that girl out of the car
or Voss'll have all our heads!

603
00:38:26,978 --> 00:38:31,274
Chief, I know Jackson Hammond.
The girl is gonna be just fine.

604
00:38:31,399 --> 00:38:34,026
This is Corey Steinhoff standing on
the shoulder of the southbound lane...

605
00:38:34,110 --> 00:38:36,487
of the 5 freeway
just past the Landview exit.

606
00:38:36,571 --> 00:38:39,031
Behind me, traffic appears
to be flowing normally.

607
00:38:39,157 --> 00:38:42,785
However, in the next few seconds
Channel 17 Hard-core News will bring you...

608
00:38:42,910 --> 00:38:47,790
the first live, on-the-ground shots of
the hair-raising chase thatJackson Hammond...

609
00:38:47,915 --> 00:38:51,210
Here they come. Here they come!

610
00:39:07,602 --> 00:39:11,898
Uh, Byron, can you get us
closer to that BMW?

611
00:39:12,023 --> 00:39:15,234
We want to get a glimpse
into one of those windows...

612
00:39:15,318 --> 00:39:18,279
and maybe we can see
if Miss Voss is tied up...

613
00:39:18,404 --> 00:39:22,033
or... or otherwise
restrained in any way.

614
00:39:22,116 --> 00:39:25,912
Well, as you can see,
from the angle that I'm at...

615
00:39:26,037 --> 00:39:29,874
it's, uh... it's pretty hard
to get a look into the window.

616
00:39:29,957 --> 00:39:32,919
I mean, this baby is moving fast.!

617
00:39:33,044 --> 00:39:36,047
- And Natalie Voss...
- Hey, hey. You're on the radio.

618
00:39:36,172 --> 00:39:40,468
Are halfway to Tijuana right now
in her hijacked BMW.

619
00:39:40,593 --> 00:39:44,222
Dalton Voss, you will remember,
was recently the subject of public outcry...

620
00:39:44,305 --> 00:39:48,935
when he decided to tear down 14 blocks
oflow-income housing in East L. A...

621
00:39:49,060 --> 00:39:51,187
to build a mid-city commuter airport.

622
00:40:16,337 --> 00:40:19,298
I always liked the cowboy the best.

623
00:40:19,382 --> 00:40:21,592
Domino's Pizza!

624
00:40:21,676 --> 00:40:25,096
- Jack, it's me, Ari.
- It's my lawyer.

625
00:40:25,179 --> 00:40:27,723
- Jack?
- Ari, I told you never to call me here.

626
00:40:27,849 --> 00:40:30,935
Jack, this is wrong.
This is very, very wrong.

627
00:40:31,018 --> 00:40:32,937
I mean, I know you're disappointed.

628
00:40:33,020 --> 00:40:36,232
Disappointed? How about destroyed, Ari?
How about devastated?

629
00:40:36,357 --> 00:40:40,153
- Jack, this is not the way to beat the system.
- Screw the system.

630
00:40:40,236 --> 00:40:42,196
No, not screw the system.

631
00:40:42,321 --> 00:40:45,449
Massage the system,
play the system, work the system...

632
00:40:45,533 --> 00:40:47,952
but don't screw the system because
the system's gonna screw you more.

633
00:40:48,035 --> 00:40:52,456
I massaged the system. Didn't I? Huh?
Didn't I do everything right?

634
00:40:52,540 --> 00:40:54,667
Yeah, you did.

635
00:40:54,750 --> 00:40:57,837
Yeah, damn straight I did.
Where did it get me? San Quentin.

636
00:40:57,962 --> 00:41:00,089
- You can't give up now.
- What do you want me to do?

637
00:41:00,214 --> 00:41:04,135
Sit around and rot for the next 25 years
while you come up with a better idea?

638
00:41:04,260 --> 00:41:08,222
Wait a minute, Ari. Now I'm a kidnapper.
I'm probably looking at life.

639
00:41:08,347 --> 00:41:11,142
Ah, forget it, pal.
This just ain't my year.

640
00:41:11,225 --> 00:41:13,811
Look, Jack, why don't you
just let the girl out?

641
00:41:13,895 --> 00:41:16,522
Nobody's gonna hurt you
if you just give yourself up.

642
00:41:16,647 --> 00:41:19,192
You'll come back, we'll talk,
we'll figure something else out.

643
00:41:19,317 --> 00:41:21,277
Maybe we can get
the public behind you.

644
00:41:21,402 --> 00:41:24,197
Public outcry against injustice
is a very powerful tool.

645
00:41:24,280 --> 00:41:26,741
Oh, yeah, the public's
gonna love my ass.

646
00:41:26,866 --> 00:41:31,704
The red-nosed robber kidnaps the richest girl
in the country. Probably get my own sitcom.

647
00:41:31,829 --> 00:41:34,540
- Don't underestimate the public.
- I ain't stoppin'.

648
00:41:34,665 --> 00:41:38,794
I'm takin' this one all the way to Mexico.
I'm going Latin, chief.

649
00:41:38,920 --> 00:41:41,005
Jack, Mexico isn't the answer.

650
00:41:41,088 --> 00:41:44,842
You're innocent. We'll get a retrial,
get that blood test admissible.

651
00:41:44,926 --> 00:41:49,388
You'll eventually get out.
So stop, give yourself up before it's too late.

652
00:41:49,514 --> 00:41:52,016
Ari, in case I don't get
another chance to say this...

653
00:41:52,141 --> 00:41:55,436
I just wanted to say
thanks for everything.

654
00:41:55,561 --> 00:41:58,022
You're really the only
honest man I know.

655
00:41:58,105 --> 00:42:02,735
You did something nobody else ever did, Ari.
You believed in me.

656
00:42:02,819 --> 00:42:05,947
- I really appreciate that.
- Jack, quit talking crazy.

657
00:42:06,072 --> 00:42:10,284
You're talking like it's over. Listen,
I still believe in you. I'm still working hard.

658
00:42:10,409 --> 00:42:12,829
We can beat this thing together.
I can get you out.

659
00:42:12,954 --> 00:42:16,833
I'm already out, Ari.
I'm already out.

660
00:42:24,799 --> 00:42:27,218
I don't want my kids to be cops.

661
00:42:27,301 --> 00:42:32,014
No, I'm out here every day risking my life
so they can have it better than me.

662
00:42:32,139 --> 00:42:35,685
I got a kid who wants to be an astronaut.
I'd like to keep it that way.

663
00:42:35,810 --> 00:42:38,437
Besides, being a cop
messes with your head.

664
00:42:38,563 --> 00:42:40,565
How so?

665
00:42:40,690 --> 00:42:44,152
I mean, every day, day in, day out,
you dealin' with the scum of the Earth.

666
00:42:44,277 --> 00:42:47,947
The only people you come in contact
with are dope pushers...

667
00:42:48,030 --> 00:42:51,492
and pimps and killers
and child molesters.

668
00:42:51,576 --> 00:42:54,245
Pretty soon you start thinking
that everybody's rotten.

669
00:42:58,499 --> 00:43:02,253
- Ari, I told you that... - Jack Hammond.
Jerry Kunkle, Channel 9 Hard-core News Live.

670
00:43:02,336 --> 00:43:05,965
While I have you on this
Channel 9 exclusive interview...

671
00:43:06,090 --> 00:43:09,927
let me ask you a question
I know is on the minds of all our viewers.

672
00:43:10,011 --> 00:43:13,139
Just what do you intend to do
when that car runs out of gas?

673
00:43:14,682 --> 00:43:17,476
That's the question on the minds
of all your viewers?

674
00:43:17,560 --> 00:43:20,062
Whether I'll run out of gas or not?

675
00:43:20,188 --> 00:43:22,899
Tell you what, Jer.
You let your viewers know...

676
00:43:23,024 --> 00:43:26,444
that I hope Miss Voss's fear
and my desperation...

677
00:43:26,527 --> 00:43:28,446
are entertainment enough for them.

678
00:43:28,529 --> 00:43:31,449
After all, that's what
this is all about, right?

679
00:43:31,532 --> 00:43:33,534
What makes for good television?

680
00:43:33,618 --> 00:43:37,830
The story as it breaks, live, coming to you
from the bad guy himself?

681
00:43:37,914 --> 00:43:41,959
I mean, we wouldn't want your viewers
to change the fucking channel, would we?

682
00:43:47,465 --> 00:43:50,426
What the hell's this world coming to?

683
00:43:51,636 --> 00:43:54,639
- Nice.
- I'm sorry.

684
00:43:54,764 --> 00:43:56,682
I'll buy you a new one.

685
00:43:56,807 --> 00:43:59,810
Subject has just passed
Flowerbowl. I'm about 30 yards back.

686
00:43:59,894 --> 00:44:04,023
- Stay with him. I'm coming on your right.
- I can't see him. Where is he?

687
00:44:04,148 --> 00:44:06,609
- He's in front of the Pier One truck!
- All right.

688
00:44:06,734 --> 00:44:09,946
We just passed the Flowerbowl.
They'll be coming up soon.

689
00:44:10,071 --> 00:44:12,114
So just slow down a little, Dale.

690
00:44:12,240 --> 00:44:16,536
I'm pumped, man.
Pumped! Stupid cops.

691
00:44:16,619 --> 00:44:20,665
- Stupid!
- Couldn't stop a snail on a salt bed.

692
00:44:20,748 --> 00:44:22,875
- You see him yet?
- No, not yet.

693
00:44:22,959 --> 00:44:26,462
- When you see him, tell me quick!
- I will!

694
00:44:26,587 --> 00:44:28,548
- Now...
- Yeah?

695
00:44:28,631 --> 00:44:32,760
When I give the order, you ram him hard
into the guard rail, Dale.

696
00:44:32,885 --> 00:44:35,096
- That'll stop him.
- I'm a road warrior!

697
00:44:35,221 --> 00:44:37,014
- I know you are, Dale.
- I am.

698
00:44:37,098 --> 00:44:40,184
Time to stop those yuppie punks, Dale!

699
00:44:40,268 --> 00:44:43,062
- Dude, are we gonna be on TV?
- You know we are, dude.

700
00:44:43,187 --> 00:44:45,064
- That's hot.
- You know we are.

701
00:44:45,189 --> 00:44:48,025
Did either of you ever actually kill anybody?

702
00:44:48,109 --> 00:44:50,486
Not yet.

703
00:44:50,611 --> 00:44:52,572
I did.

704
00:44:56,117 --> 00:44:58,035
How did it feel?

705
00:44:58,119 --> 00:45:01,080
It didn't feel like
I thought it would.

706
00:45:01,164 --> 00:45:03,082
It felt shitty.

707
00:45:03,166 --> 00:45:05,126
It felt wrong.

708
00:45:05,251 --> 00:45:07,128
But what can you do?

709
00:45:07,253 --> 00:45:09,589
Partner, there's nothing
you could do.

710
00:45:09,672 --> 00:45:11,924
That's what I keep telling myself.

711
00:45:12,008 --> 00:45:14,677
Of course I'd do it again if I had to.
I mean, it's my job.

712
00:45:16,470 --> 00:45:20,266
- Hold that thought. I gotta change tapes.
- This is great stuff, guys.

713
00:45:20,391 --> 00:45:23,186
I mean, really, really, really good stuff.
Real true-to-life.

714
00:45:23,311 --> 00:45:25,897
- I love it.
- Thanks. Thanks a lot.

715
00:45:35,156 --> 00:45:37,950
All right, come on down.!
Set it right here.!

716
00:45:38,075 --> 00:45:39,952
That's good.!

717
00:45:40,077 --> 00:45:42,538
Move, move, move.!

718
00:45:51,589 --> 00:45:53,591
I want you over there.

719
00:45:53,716 --> 00:45:55,676
Hey! Watch it.

720
00:46:01,682 --> 00:46:03,601
We're up.

721
00:46:06,187 --> 00:46:10,858
Bill, Wendy, Tom Capone standing here at
the border between California and Tijuana.

722
00:46:10,983 --> 00:46:12,860
As you can see behind me...

723
00:46:12,985 --> 00:46:16,280
the San Diego P.D. and the C.H.P.
are working feverishly...

724
00:46:16,364 --> 00:46:18,658
to create an impenetrable
wall of force...

725
00:46:18,783 --> 00:46:20,743
here at the gateway into Mexico...

726
00:46:20,868 --> 00:46:23,621
in hopes of stopping this heinous chase
from crossing the border.

727
00:46:23,704 --> 00:46:26,833
Is such a radical measure safe
for the captive Miss Voss?

728
00:46:26,958 --> 00:46:29,710
The San Diego P.D. says yes,
the critics say no...

729
00:46:29,836 --> 00:46:31,838
but only time will tell.

730
00:46:33,840 --> 00:46:35,842
Hello, San Diego.

731
00:46:35,967 --> 00:46:37,927
Afternoon, Newport.

732
00:46:49,897 --> 00:46:52,191
What are you doing?

733
00:46:52,316 --> 00:46:55,778
- I was going to offer you a piece of gum.
- Oh.

734
00:47:00,116 --> 00:47:05,037
- What'd you think was in there, a knife or something?
- You could have mace.

735
00:47:05,121 --> 00:47:08,916
If I had mace, I would have used it by now.
You're not a smart criminal.

736
00:47:09,041 --> 00:47:12,295
Thank you.
That's what I've been trying to tell you.

737
00:47:12,420 --> 00:47:15,381
So are you gonna tell me
why you're on the run?

738
00:47:17,466 --> 00:47:21,637
You wouldn't believe me.
I'm not so sure I believe me anymore.

739
00:47:21,762 --> 00:47:25,183
- Try me.
- Promise you won't laugh.

740
00:47:25,266 --> 00:47:27,351
Why would I laugh?

741
00:47:29,478 --> 00:47:33,399
Okay, two years ago, I'm sittin' at home,
watchin' a ball game.

742
00:47:33,524 --> 00:47:36,194
- Dodgers are losing.
- I hate the Dodgers.

743
00:47:36,277 --> 00:47:39,363
- You wanna hear this or not?
- I'm sorry.

744
00:47:42,575 --> 00:47:45,161
At the same time,
on the other side of the city...

745
00:47:45,286 --> 00:47:47,747
there's some guy robbing a bank,
dressed like a clown.

746
00:47:47,830 --> 00:47:50,416
- A clown?
- Yes, a clown.

747
00:47:50,541 --> 00:47:53,753
It seems that some jerk
had knocked off several banks...

748
00:47:53,836 --> 00:47:55,755
in a clown outfit.

749
00:47:55,838 --> 00:47:58,174
The media, in all of their originality,
picked up on this...

750
00:47:58,299 --> 00:48:00,176
and labeled him the red-nosed robber.

751
00:48:00,301 --> 00:48:03,221
So I'm coming out of Osco's
a couple days later.

752
00:48:03,304 --> 00:48:06,974
There's two cops waiting for me.
Bang, they haul me in.

753
00:48:07,099 --> 00:48:09,852
- Why would they haul you in?
- Let me get to that.

754
00:48:09,977 --> 00:48:12,230
I was stuck in Sonoma.

755
00:48:12,313 --> 00:48:16,776
The only job I could wrangle was playin'
a clown at kids' birthday parties...

756
00:48:16,859 --> 00:48:18,861
which wasn't such a bad gig.

757
00:48:18,986 --> 00:48:21,697
Flexible hours,
a lot of free cake.

758
00:48:21,823 --> 00:48:24,575
One of my neighbors, some old battle-ax,
sees the story on the news.

759
00:48:24,659 --> 00:48:27,119
She calls the cops.

760
00:48:27,245 --> 00:48:31,207
They get a search warrant,
crash down the door, find the costume.

761
00:48:31,332 --> 00:48:34,794
- It's all over.
- Did you have to wear those big shoes?

762
00:48:34,919 --> 00:48:36,587
I knew you'd make fun of me.

763
00:48:36,671 --> 00:48:40,299
I'm sorry. I'm not.
I'm not. Go on.

764
00:48:40,383 --> 00:48:44,178
So Ari keeps saying, "Don't worry.
They don't put innocent people in jail. "

765
00:48:44,303 --> 00:48:47,306
Well, he was obviously wrong
because they do.

766
00:48:52,353 --> 00:48:56,399
- What are you looking at?
- I don't quite picture you as a clown.

767
00:48:56,524 --> 00:48:59,944
- So you don't believe me.
- I didn't say that.

768
00:49:00,111 --> 00:49:02,321
They're here!
That's them!

769
00:49:07,201 --> 00:49:09,579
- Ram 'em!
- Time to be heroes!

770
00:49:11,622 --> 00:49:13,666
- Missed 'em!
- Hey! Look out!

771
00:49:13,791 --> 00:49:15,793
- I missed 'em.!
- Adjust, Dale!

772
00:49:15,877 --> 00:49:18,921
- Jack!
- What the hell is that guy doing?

773
00:49:19,046 --> 00:49:21,007
Okay! I got it! I got it!

774
00:49:25,052 --> 00:49:26,637
Back the other way!

775
00:49:29,307 --> 00:49:31,684
Whoa!

776
00:49:35,438 --> 00:49:37,857
Oh, no!

777
00:49:43,070 --> 00:49:45,114
Holy mother of God!

778
00:49:45,239 --> 00:49:47,617
You've gotta be kidding me.

779
00:49:55,791 --> 00:49:57,835
Oh, my God!
Do something!

780
00:49:57,919 --> 00:50:01,339
Bill, Wendy!
Are you seeing this in the studio?

781
00:50:02,423 --> 00:50:04,050
Do something!

782
00:50:06,928 --> 00:50:09,222
Oh, my God.!

783
00:50:32,954 --> 00:50:36,582
Astonishing and tragic imagery.

784
00:50:36,707 --> 00:50:39,210
A green monster truck...

785
00:50:39,293 --> 00:50:42,171
obviously an undercover
law enforcement vehicle...

786
00:50:42,296 --> 00:50:45,716
made a valiant attempt
to sideswipe the BMW...

787
00:50:45,842 --> 00:50:48,177
with disastrous results.

788
00:50:48,302 --> 00:50:50,263
Almost ready, Mr. Josephson.

789
00:50:50,346 --> 00:50:53,474
That was a pretty dangerous
and radical maneuver from the police...

790
00:50:53,599 --> 00:50:56,561
especially with a hostage at risk
and that roadblock up ahead.

791
00:50:56,644 --> 00:50:59,647
- Wouldn't you say, Byron?
- Radical? Yes.

792
00:50:59,772 --> 00:51:02,275
But I imagine these cops
are getting awfully desperate.

793
00:51:02,441 --> 00:51:04,777
- Three, two. You're on.
- Randy, thank you very much.

794
00:51:04,861 --> 00:51:08,656
This is Paul Dandridge with Channel 3's live,
on-the-scene, exclusive interview...

795
00:51:08,781 --> 00:51:11,742
with Jackson Hammond's
attorney, AriJosephson.

796
00:51:11,826 --> 00:51:14,704
Mr. Josephson,
if Mr. Hammond is innocent...

797
00:51:14,829 --> 00:51:18,749
why was he found guilty
beyond a reasonable doubt by a jury?

798
00:51:18,833 --> 00:51:22,587
During the bank robbery,
the actual thief cut his hand...

799
00:51:22,670 --> 00:51:24,755
on the teller's paper spindle.

800
00:51:24,881 --> 00:51:27,800
A sample of that dried blood
was taken and tested...

801
00:51:27,884 --> 00:51:30,261
and compared with a sample
of my client's blood.

802
00:51:30,344 --> 00:51:32,555
Jack's blood is type "B" positive.

803
00:51:32,680 --> 00:51:34,974
The red-nosed robber's blood is type "A."

804
00:51:35,057 --> 00:51:38,477
But because the evidence was collected
improperly from the crime scene...

805
00:51:38,603 --> 00:51:40,480
it was deemed inadmissible in court.

806
00:51:40,605 --> 00:51:42,982
Thank you very much.
Let's go back to the studio.

807
00:51:47,361 --> 00:51:50,823
Hey.! Hey, look at that.
You're a folk hero already.

808
00:51:50,948 --> 00:51:52,783
I don't care.

809
00:51:52,867 --> 00:51:55,995
If you ask me, I think your lawyer's right...
you should keep on fighting.

810
00:51:56,120 --> 00:51:57,955
Almost sounds like you believe me.

811
00:51:58,039 --> 00:52:01,334
You don't strike me as the kind of guy
who gives up that easily.

812
00:52:01,417 --> 00:52:03,377
What makes you think that?

813
00:52:04,629 --> 00:52:07,131
- Ah, that.
- Yeah, that.

814
00:52:07,215 --> 00:52:10,134
I'm 28 years old, Natalie.
I got a lot of good years ahead of me.

815
00:52:10,218 --> 00:52:12,178
I'm not going to waste them away
in some prison.

816
00:52:12,261 --> 00:52:13,971
- Yeah, but...
- Yeah, but what?

817
00:52:14,055 --> 00:52:17,016
While you're out getting married
and taking vacations...

818
00:52:17,099 --> 00:52:19,101
and having barbecues
in the backyard...

819
00:52:19,227 --> 00:52:21,521
and getting all excited
about your kid's first tooth...

820
00:52:21,604 --> 00:52:26,192
I'll be in a concrete cell
surrounded by murderers and rapists...

821
00:52:26,317 --> 00:52:29,111
large hairy-backed men
who think I have a real cute ass.

822
00:52:29,237 --> 00:52:31,197
I am sorry, but it's just not my style.

823
00:52:31,322 --> 00:52:33,324
There's got to be
something you can do.

824
00:52:33,407 --> 00:52:38,120
I mean, if the blood test proves it, why can't
you just stand up in court and scream it?

825
00:52:38,246 --> 00:52:40,289
This is your life we're talking about.

826
00:52:40,414 --> 00:52:43,334
They've got all these
little rules and precedents...

827
00:52:43,417 --> 00:52:46,087
and procedures
and legal loopholes...

828
00:52:46,212 --> 00:52:48,673
and all these fancy words
and books...

829
00:52:48,756 --> 00:52:51,551
all this crap that's more important
than a human being.

830
00:52:51,634 --> 00:52:54,720
- So that's it?
- Just about, yeah.

831
00:52:57,682 --> 00:53:00,309
- When were you sentenced?
- Yesterday.

832
00:53:02,436 --> 00:53:05,356
- So that's why you ran?
- Yep.

833
00:53:05,439 --> 00:53:08,234
- And that's why you stole the car.
- Yep.

834
00:53:10,153 --> 00:53:13,489
And that's why you freaked out
when you saw the cops and grabbed me?

835
00:53:14,615 --> 00:53:16,576
You're catching on fast, kid.

836
00:53:19,745 --> 00:53:21,789
I don't blame you.

837
00:53:23,624 --> 00:53:25,585
I do not know why, but...

838
00:53:27,295 --> 00:53:30,923
- I believe you, Jack.
- Thanks.

839
00:53:31,007 --> 00:53:33,926
That means a lot to me.

840
00:53:40,474 --> 00:53:44,437
And so to be able to almost bust
someone before they do the crime...

841
00:53:44,520 --> 00:53:46,898
you have to be somewhat telepathic.

842
00:53:46,981 --> 00:53:50,193
So that's why I see myself
as almost a prophet.

843
00:53:50,318 --> 00:53:52,278
A street prophet, if you will.

844
00:53:52,361 --> 00:53:54,363
I got to change microphones.

845
00:53:54,489 --> 00:53:58,910
- What?
- I gotta fix the mike. It'll just take a second.

846
00:53:59,035 --> 00:54:00,953
I gotta get that...

847
00:54:01,037 --> 00:54:03,289
Back off! Back off, will you!
That's dangerous!

848
00:54:03,414 --> 00:54:06,918
Get-Get down,
you stupid little nothing!

849
00:54:19,889 --> 00:54:22,308
- What is this?
- What?

850
00:54:22,433 --> 00:54:25,394
I don't believe this.

851
00:54:25,520 --> 00:54:29,607
This is Frank Smuntz, Channel 12
San Diego Evening News...

852
00:54:29,690 --> 00:54:32,485
riding in the thick of
the police high-speed chase.

853
00:54:32,568 --> 00:54:37,240
As you can see, Channel 12 is the first newscast
to get a close-up look...

854
00:54:37,365 --> 00:54:39,492
into the face of this runaway horror.

855
00:54:39,575 --> 00:54:45,122
If we're lucky, we're hoping to get a visual
conformation on the condition of the hostage.

856
00:54:45,206 --> 00:54:47,083
Miss Voss.!

857
00:54:47,166 --> 00:54:50,169
Miss Voss!

858
00:54:50,294 --> 00:54:55,174
Can you give us a thumbs-up
if you're okay?

859
00:54:55,258 --> 00:54:59,136
- Right here, pal.
- Can we show that on TV?

860
00:55:08,688 --> 00:55:11,607
Uh, Frank? Frank?

861
00:55:11,732 --> 00:55:16,445
Um, it appears we've lost our feed there
from Frank Smuntz...

862
00:55:16,571 --> 00:55:20,658
riding right alongside
that speeding BMW.

863
00:55:20,741 --> 00:55:22,785
- Lolly.
- Thanks, Steve.

864
00:55:22,910 --> 00:55:26,581
I think before we continue we should take
a moment to apologize to our viewers...

865
00:55:26,706 --> 00:55:30,543
for that obscene gesture you just saw coming
from the window of that speeding car.

866
00:55:30,668 --> 00:55:35,798
Yes. That's the risk we take
with live TV, isn't it, Lolly?

867
00:55:35,923 --> 00:55:38,885
That's right. We'll be back
with more live coverage...

868
00:55:39,010 --> 00:55:40,887
of Kidnapped At
100 Miles Per Hour...

869
00:55:41,012 --> 00:55:42,972
after these messages.

870
00:55:46,726 --> 00:55:49,395
Oh, I've had my share of boyfriends.

871
00:55:49,520 --> 00:55:52,690
But they've all been losers.
You know... boring.

872
00:55:52,773 --> 00:55:55,401
They'd have to be.
My father had to approve of them all.

873
00:55:55,526 --> 00:55:59,030
Old Dalt can't be that bad.
He must have done something right.

874
00:55:59,113 --> 00:56:02,742
- Why?
- Well, look how great you turned out to be.

875
00:56:02,867 --> 00:56:06,412
Oh, me? Come on.
I'm a total basket case.

876
00:56:06,537 --> 00:56:08,414
You don't even know the half of it.

877
00:56:08,539 --> 00:56:10,958
No, no. My intuition
about people is very good.

878
00:56:11,083 --> 00:56:13,252
I could tell right away
you had your act together.

879
00:56:13,377 --> 00:56:15,588
Yeah? When did you decide that?

880
00:56:15,671 --> 00:56:20,092
In the convenience store
when we shared that look. Remember?

881
00:56:22,261 --> 00:56:24,472
Yeah.

882
00:56:25,848 --> 00:56:28,392
Thought to myself
only if life were different...

883
00:56:28,476 --> 00:56:30,478
maybe I could meet
a girl like that someday.

884
00:56:31,687 --> 00:56:33,606
- Really?
- Swear to God.

885
00:56:33,689 --> 00:56:36,859
Believe it or not, when I was
holding the gun to your back...

886
00:56:36,984 --> 00:56:40,780
I couldn't help but notice
how lovely your hair smelled.

887
00:56:40,905 --> 00:56:43,908
- You're crazy.
- That would be affirmative.

888
00:56:43,991 --> 00:56:46,035
You know, you really hurt me
with that gun.

889
00:56:46,160 --> 00:56:50,164
- You didn't have to jam it into my back so hard.
- I'm sorry.

890
00:56:51,499 --> 00:56:53,459
About the gun, uh...

891
00:56:58,339 --> 00:57:01,759
- What?
- It makes a handy weapon in a pinch.

892
00:57:03,010 --> 00:57:05,304
You kidnapped me with a candy bar?

893
00:57:05,388 --> 00:57:08,391
Well, you have to admit
it was rather inventive.

894
00:57:08,474 --> 00:57:10,393
Oh, God.

895
00:57:10,476 --> 00:57:12,979
Don't be upset. If I'd had a real gun,
I would have used it.

896
00:57:13,062 --> 00:57:15,064
It sure felt like a gun.

897
00:57:15,189 --> 00:57:17,650
I thought for sure everybody
would hear the wrapper crinkle.

898
00:57:17,733 --> 00:57:21,779
Oh, God.
I can just see the headline now.

899
00:57:21,904 --> 00:57:27,160
- Hey. Hey, candy thief.
- "Kidnapper Exposed When Candy Gun Melts In Hand. "

900
00:57:31,581 --> 00:57:33,833
Hey! Hey! Come on.

901
00:57:33,916 --> 00:57:36,335
Thanks. Thank you.

902
00:57:36,419 --> 00:57:40,965
If my father only knew you
kidnapped me with a candy bar.

903
00:57:41,048 --> 00:57:43,092
Think of the embarrassment.

904
00:57:44,218 --> 00:57:47,263
Oh, God, what a jerk.

905
00:57:47,346 --> 00:57:52,518
You know, he's probably thinking right now
about how he can use all this publicity...

906
00:57:52,602 --> 00:57:55,605
'cause he wants to run
for governor of California.

907
00:57:55,730 --> 00:57:58,274
Now listen, once
this whole fiasco is over...

908
00:57:58,357 --> 00:58:01,903
I want you to get me and Natalie
on A.M. San Diego...

909
00:58:02,028 --> 00:58:03,988
and all the national morning shows.

910
00:58:04,113 --> 00:58:06,032
Call Ted Turner.

911
00:58:06,115 --> 00:58:09,410
Tell him I'll give him an exclusive
first once this insane thing is wrapped up...

912
00:58:09,535 --> 00:58:12,413
in exchange for some good publicity.

913
00:58:12,538 --> 00:58:15,374
He owes me one.
Uh, you get to work. I'll call you back.

914
00:58:15,500 --> 00:58:17,376
- Mr. Voss?
- What is it?

915
00:58:17,502 --> 00:58:21,964
- Our chopper's back.
- Well, it's about time. Get me to that barricade.

916
00:58:22,089 --> 00:58:25,218
Thanks, Rocky. This is Paige Grunion
with Channel 17 Hard-core News.

917
00:58:25,343 --> 00:58:28,221
I am coming to you live on
the shoulder of the 5 Freeway.

918
00:58:28,304 --> 00:58:30,223
And standing here with me
are Will and Dale.

919
00:58:30,306 --> 00:58:32,391
They are the drivers
of the green monster van.

920
00:58:32,517 --> 00:58:34,435
- Tell me, gentlemen...
- Monster truck.

921
00:58:34,560 --> 00:58:38,231
Monster truck. What possessed you to
take such radical and desperate measures...

922
00:58:38,356 --> 00:58:40,233
to stop the BMWyourselves?

923
00:58:40,358 --> 00:58:45,404
Oh! Dude! We are just doing our duty
as Americans. Right, Will?

924
00:58:45,530 --> 00:58:48,950
That's right. And that's not the first time
we've had to take matters into our own hands.

925
00:58:49,075 --> 00:58:51,953
Mark my words,
they'll be pulling over soon.

926
00:58:52,078 --> 00:58:53,955
We really scared them.
Didn't we? Didn't we?

927
00:58:54,080 --> 00:58:56,165
- Did you see the look on their faces?
- Sure did.

928
00:58:56,290 --> 00:58:59,377
- Whoa!
- And we'd be happy to tell anyone about it. Anyone.

929
00:58:59,460 --> 00:59:02,171
- Anytime!
- On-On Oprah. Or Geraldo.

930
00:59:02,296 --> 00:59:04,924
- Or SallyJesse. Or any-any...
- Larry King. Larry King.

931
00:59:05,007 --> 00:59:07,051
Yeah. Or any of those shows.

932
00:59:07,134 --> 00:59:11,347
That's right. And you can usually find us
at Big Willy's Dirty Dogs. Most times.

933
00:59:11,430 --> 00:59:13,349
My name is Will, and this is Dale.

934
00:59:13,432 --> 00:59:15,935
And we've been through a lot ofheavy stuff
in that truck before.

935
00:59:16,018 --> 00:59:19,147
- Monster madness, dude.
- Major monster madness.

936
00:59:19,272 --> 00:59:21,440
- Gentlemen, please.
- What? But-But...

937
00:59:21,566 --> 00:59:23,776
- We're not fooling around! We're not fooling around!
- Get in the back.

938
00:59:23,901 --> 00:59:28,906
Sometimes you got to take the bull by
the horns! We're American citizens!

939
00:59:28,990 --> 00:59:31,742
And there you have it. Who says the great
American hero is a thing of the past?

940
00:59:31,826 --> 00:59:35,454
- Back to you, Rocky...
- I hope you can see this, Bill and Wendy.

941
00:59:35,580 --> 00:59:39,458
It's like a circus down there.

942
00:59:39,542 --> 00:59:41,836
You know, Byron, it's easy for us
reporting this story...

943
00:59:41,961 --> 00:59:45,131
to forget there's a very scared
little girl inside that car.

944
00:59:45,256 --> 00:59:47,341
We can only imagine,
as this chase continues...

945
00:59:47,466 --> 00:59:50,761
the horror young Natalie Voss
is experiencing right now.

946
00:59:52,263 --> 00:59:54,265
Oh, shit.

947
00:59:54,390 --> 00:59:57,351
- Just-Just hold still.
- It stings.

948
00:59:58,686 --> 01:00:02,607
- Mm!
- I don't want it to get infected.

949
01:00:02,690 --> 01:00:05,985
- I'm so sorry about this.
- As you should be.

950
01:00:13,034 --> 01:00:16,120
- What are you doing?
- You're sweating.

951
01:00:25,046 --> 01:00:28,883
I've never met anybody
quite like you, Jack.

952
01:00:29,008 --> 01:00:31,052
I wish things were different.

953
01:00:31,177 --> 01:00:34,347
I'm really a pretty likable guy
when I'm not a fugitive.

954
01:00:34,430 --> 01:00:37,225
I wish things were different too.

955
01:00:37,350 --> 01:00:39,227
Isn't it funny how people meet?

956
01:00:39,352 --> 01:00:42,230
I mean, they can come from
two totally different worlds...

957
01:00:42,355 --> 01:00:45,691
and never even know
each other exists.

958
01:00:45,817 --> 01:00:50,988
And then one day they meet
and their lives are never the same.

959
01:00:51,072 --> 01:00:53,699
- Are you married?
- No.

960
01:00:56,035 --> 01:00:57,912
Do you have a girlfriend?

961
01:00:58,037 --> 01:01:00,915
No, I don't have a girlfriend.

962
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:05,002
And it's true that...

963
01:01:05,127 --> 01:01:09,674
you haven't been with a woman
in a couple of years?

964
01:01:09,799 --> 01:01:11,759
It's true, yeah.

965
01:01:14,053 --> 01:01:17,348
If all this doesn't work out,
you'll go back to prison, right?

966
01:01:17,431 --> 01:01:19,392
Probably.

967
01:01:23,020 --> 01:01:25,231
So it's conceivable that...

968
01:01:27,733 --> 01:01:30,903
you'd never be with a woman
ever again, right?

969
01:01:31,028 --> 01:01:32,989
Right.

970
01:01:38,077 --> 01:01:40,037
What are you doing?

971
01:01:42,123 --> 01:01:44,208
Falling in love with you.

972
01:01:53,509 --> 01:01:57,680
Natalie, you can't...
We can't do this.

973
01:01:58,973 --> 01:02:01,267
I can't help it.

974
01:02:01,392 --> 01:02:04,687
We may never have
this chance again.

975
01:02:32,840 --> 01:02:34,967
Wait a second.
Wait a second.

976
01:02:53,277 --> 01:02:56,948
Can't see the road.

977
01:02:57,031 --> 01:03:00,993
There it is. There's the road.

978
01:03:06,874 --> 01:03:10,127
Ten more miles, do or die.

979
01:03:10,211 --> 01:03:12,338
What the hell is he
swerving all over for?

980
01:04:22,909 --> 01:04:24,785
I just figured it all out.

981
01:04:24,911 --> 01:04:27,830
It's just like you said.
I'm your insurance policy.

982
01:04:27,914 --> 01:04:29,832
What are you talking about?

983
01:04:29,916 --> 01:04:32,919
Well, as long as I'm your hostage,
they can't get to you.

984
01:04:33,044 --> 01:04:35,129
You can demand a ransom
from my father...

985
01:04:35,254 --> 01:04:39,091
we'll take the money, we'll escape to Mexico
just like you said.

986
01:04:39,175 --> 01:04:42,512
Hey, hey, hey.
Hold on a minute here, Patty Hearst.

987
01:04:42,637 --> 01:04:46,265
- What?
- On second thought, maybe Mexico ain't such a hot idea.

988
01:04:46,390 --> 01:04:49,060
We'll have to wait in line at the border
while they check the trunk for illegal fruit.

989
01:04:49,143 --> 01:04:53,439
- I mean, come on.
- No, I'm completely serious. They'll never be able to get us.

990
01:04:53,523 --> 01:04:57,443
I'm your hostage. There's no way they could
possibly think we're in this together.

991
01:04:57,568 --> 01:05:00,696
It's getting close.
It's getting real close.

992
01:05:00,780 --> 01:05:03,699
Subject vehicle, red BMW...

993
01:05:03,783 --> 01:05:06,702
now approaching
with suspect and hostage.

994
01:05:06,786 --> 01:05:10,498
- All officers take your positions.
- Move! Come on! Come on!

995
01:05:12,291 --> 01:05:15,545
Prepare to engage suspect.

996
01:05:19,090 --> 01:05:23,010
All emergency services
remain in position.

997
01:05:23,135 --> 01:05:25,304
Fire, be ready with foam.

998
01:05:25,388 --> 01:05:27,348
Paramedics, stand by.

999
01:05:30,893 --> 01:05:34,438
- This could actually work.
- Yes, it's gonna work. It's gonna work.

1000
01:05:34,564 --> 01:05:37,942
- All right.
- I know this beautiful spot in Cabo San Lucas...

1001
01:05:38,025 --> 01:05:40,736
where the beaches are gorgeous.

1002
01:05:40,820 --> 01:05:42,905
God, this is so romantic.

1003
01:05:42,989 --> 01:05:46,576
Have you noticed that there's no other cars
on the road anymore?

1004
01:05:46,701 --> 01:05:48,661
Cars?

1005
01:05:48,744 --> 01:05:53,499
Attention.! Subject vehicle
is 500 yards and approaching fast.

1006
01:05:54,959 --> 01:05:57,503
All personnel stand clear
of the barricade.

1007
01:05:58,754 --> 01:06:00,506
Oh, my God.

1008
01:06:00,590 --> 01:06:02,508
- Strap in!
- Oh, shit!

1009
01:06:02,592 --> 01:06:04,969
Strap in! Hang on!

1010
01:06:12,059 --> 01:06:16,314
Maybe this whole thing
wasn't such a hot idea after all.

1011
01:06:16,397 --> 01:06:18,483
This is it!

1012
01:06:18,608 --> 01:06:22,111
- This is more exciting than election night!
- Box 'em in! Box 'em in!

1013
01:06:22,195 --> 01:06:24,780
- Do something!
- Like what?

1014
01:06:24,864 --> 01:06:27,033
I don't know! Anything!

1015
01:06:29,869 --> 01:06:32,205
- What are you doing?
- Anything!

1016
01:06:34,665 --> 01:06:36,667
Holy shit!

1017
01:06:47,345 --> 01:06:51,224
This is unheard-of!
The surprise roadblock has backfired!

1018
01:06:51,349 --> 01:06:56,562
- Hammond's outsmarted the cops!
- Get in control out there! Stop that damn car!

1019
01:07:09,450 --> 01:07:12,161
Don't panic!

1020
01:07:19,544 --> 01:07:22,547
- The tension is unbearable!
- Shit! - Yes, sir!

1021
01:07:22,672 --> 01:07:26,717
- Stay close to your sets.!
- Oh! I'm gonna die! I'm gonna die!

1022
01:07:26,843 --> 01:07:29,220
You're not gonna die! Relax!

1023
01:07:33,432 --> 01:07:35,935
Keep shooting!
Think of my Emmy!

1024
01:07:42,942 --> 01:07:47,905
Take your stinking paws off me,
you damn dirty ape!

1025
01:07:47,989 --> 01:07:50,908
Monkeys.

1026
01:07:50,992 --> 01:07:52,952
Fix this damn thing.

1027
01:08:00,585 --> 01:08:02,587
Whoo!

1028
01:08:30,573 --> 01:08:34,494
Hammond seems to be...
Bill, Wendy, can you see this?

1029
01:08:34,619 --> 01:08:38,331
Hammond is leading the pursuit in
a giant game of ring-around-the-rosy.

1030
01:08:38,414 --> 01:08:41,959
Jack, you anti-hero, if you're
going to get away, get away now.

1031
01:08:42,043 --> 01:08:44,879
Bill, this is really ridiculous. It's pretty clear
now that this guy, Jack Hammond...

1032
01:08:45,004 --> 01:08:46,964
is just toying with the police.

1033
01:08:47,048 --> 01:08:50,134
I hope they put him away
for a long time.

1034
01:08:50,259 --> 01:08:53,346
- You are dead serious about going with me?
- Serious as a heart attack.

1035
01:08:53,471 --> 01:08:56,265
You are absolutely, positively,
100% sure about this?

1036
01:08:56,349 --> 01:08:59,811
I have never been more sure
about anything in my entire life.

1037
01:09:05,775 --> 01:09:08,694
- We'll be fugitives.
- Sounds exciting.

1038
01:09:08,778 --> 01:09:11,322
- You won't be Natalie Voss anymore.
- Who the hell is she anyway?

1039
01:09:11,405 --> 01:09:13,699
I don't know. I don't know. But you're
going to give up everything for me?

1040
01:09:13,825 --> 01:09:16,828
Don't flatter yourself.
I'm doing it for me too.

1041
01:09:16,953 --> 01:09:18,871
Of course you are.

1042
01:10:12,008 --> 01:10:13,968
This is it.!

1043
01:10:16,804 --> 01:10:18,723
Let go of the girl, Hammond!

1044
01:10:42,914 --> 01:10:45,291
What are you doing?
Let's keep going.

1045
01:10:45,416 --> 01:10:47,293
Look, Natalie,
if I had things my way...

1046
01:10:47,418 --> 01:10:50,296
you'd be the girl I'd run away
to paradise with.

1047
01:10:50,421 --> 01:10:52,715
But I'm gonna be your hostage.

1048
01:10:52,798 --> 01:10:55,259
Natalie, it's over.

1049
01:10:57,136 --> 01:11:00,765
I can't let you ruin your life
because of me.

1050
01:11:02,767 --> 01:11:07,104
- I think it's time for you to go home now.
- You can't mean that.

1051
01:11:10,066 --> 01:11:12,610
You know, until yesterday...

1052
01:11:12,693 --> 01:11:16,656
the worst thing I ever did in
my whole life was cheat on a biology exam.

1053
01:11:18,157 --> 01:11:20,618
And now I'm a car thief...

1054
01:11:20,743 --> 01:11:22,870
a kidnapper...

1055
01:11:22,995 --> 01:11:25,957
cop-shooter, police-evader.

1056
01:11:27,792 --> 01:11:29,752
I can't do this to you.

1057
01:11:31,337 --> 01:11:34,507
I can't make you
part of this anymore.

1058
01:11:36,676 --> 01:11:38,678
I care about you too much.

1059
01:11:41,305 --> 01:11:45,643
Besides, I can't hold you
hostage anymore.

1060
01:11:45,726 --> 01:11:47,687
We ate the gun.

1061
01:11:48,980 --> 01:11:51,149
But you have the real gun.

1062
01:11:51,232 --> 01:11:53,192
Uh...

1063
01:11:55,069 --> 01:11:57,321
real guns make me nervous.

1064
01:12:02,869 --> 01:12:05,121
I do better with the candy ones.

1065
01:12:05,204 --> 01:12:07,331
Jack, you're innocent.

1066
01:12:09,417 --> 01:12:11,377
We can make this work.

1067
01:12:16,883 --> 01:12:20,887
You... You're really something.
You know that?

1068
01:12:23,431 --> 01:12:26,642
- Thank you.
- For what?

1069
01:12:26,726 --> 01:12:28,853
For believing in me.

1070
01:12:28,936 --> 01:12:31,939
Let the girl go now, Hammond!

1071
01:12:32,064 --> 01:12:35,026
It's been a hell of a ride, huh, kid?

1072
01:12:36,611 --> 01:12:39,780
What say you, uh...

1073
01:12:39,906 --> 01:12:42,867
step out of the car
and walk away from me?

1074
01:12:43,951 --> 01:12:46,704
- I'll be fine.
- You come with me.

1075
01:12:46,787 --> 01:12:50,875
You first.
I'm right behind you.

1076
01:13:41,509 --> 01:13:44,178
Miss Voss.!
Miss Voss.! Okay, stay down.

1077
01:13:44,303 --> 01:13:46,305
Oh, you're a lucky girl.
You're a lucky girl.

1078
01:13:46,430 --> 01:13:49,100
Just get behind the door there.
Just get right behind the door there.

1079
01:13:49,183 --> 01:13:51,144
We will take care of him.
Don't worry.

1080
01:13:51,269 --> 01:13:53,312
Boy, I hope he tries something now.

1081
01:13:53,437 --> 01:13:57,150
Come on, Hammond.
Just give me one reason.

1082
01:14:01,320 --> 01:14:06,075
Way to go, Jack.
Way to go.

1083
01:14:06,159 --> 01:14:09,287
Come on, Hammond!
You're in a no-win situation!

1084
01:14:09,370 --> 01:14:11,747
Put your hands out of the car
where I can see them!

1085
01:16:08,531 --> 01:16:11,117
- Stand up, Hammond.! Stand up.!
- Get up.! Turn around, turn around.!

1086
01:16:11,242 --> 01:16:14,412
Turn around.! Hands on your head.!
On your head.!

1087
01:16:14,495 --> 01:16:16,455
You know the drill.

1088
01:16:16,539 --> 01:16:22,420
- You got him? You got him.
- We got you now, my friend. Take it nice and easy now.

1089
01:16:22,503 --> 01:16:24,964
- Eyes forward.
- Nice and easy. That hand down!

1090
01:16:25,047 --> 01:16:28,384
- Nice and easy.
- They're on him!

1091
01:16:28,467 --> 01:16:30,136
Damn.! I'd love to kill you.!

1092
01:16:32,054 --> 01:16:34,307
- What the...
- You got it?

1093
01:16:34,432 --> 01:16:38,102
- Cigarettes.
- Ha!

1094
01:16:39,270 --> 01:16:41,481
I wish you'd run.

1095
01:16:41,606 --> 01:16:44,400
I'd love to kill you.
I would love to kill you.

1096
01:16:44,484 --> 01:16:46,486
But you can't run,
'cause you're busted.!

1097
01:16:46,569 --> 01:16:49,363
Eyes forward!

1098
01:16:51,240 --> 01:16:54,160
I don't like you.

1099
01:16:56,454 --> 01:16:59,499
Keep your gun on him.!
Keep your gun on him.!

1100
01:17:00,875 --> 01:17:04,795
Ain't nothing gonna
help you, Hammond.

1101
01:17:25,566 --> 01:17:27,527
I'm sorry about all this, Mr. Voss.

1102
01:17:28,903 --> 01:17:31,322
Your daughter is a fine young lady.

1103
01:17:36,369 --> 01:17:39,622
This is the money shot, Ned.
The father-daughter reunion.

1104
01:17:40,873 --> 01:17:44,210
- Beautiful.
- He didn't hurt me. He's innocent.

1105
01:17:44,293 --> 01:17:46,337
- He's innocent!
- Later.

1106
01:17:46,462 --> 01:17:51,008
That really was funny. That was really funny
how that guy smacked you.

1107
01:17:51,133 --> 01:17:52,885
Give him his rights.

1108
01:17:52,969 --> 01:17:55,638
Now that we're spending
all this quality time together...

1109
01:17:55,721 --> 01:17:57,640
let me tell you about your rights.

1110
01:17:57,723 --> 01:17:59,559
You have the right to remain silent.

1111
01:17:59,684 --> 01:18:02,478
Anything you say can and will be
used against you in a court oflaw.

1112
01:18:02,562 --> 01:18:04,564
If you do not have an attorney,
one will be assigned to you.

1113
01:18:04,647 --> 01:18:06,983
Do you understand all the rights
I have read to you right now?

1114
01:18:07,066 --> 01:18:09,152
- Yes.
- Good boy. Now shut up.!

1115
01:18:09,235 --> 01:18:13,072
- How's it look? How's it look?
- It's beautiful.

1116
01:18:13,156 --> 01:18:16,409
Know what happens to pretty boys like you
when they go to prison after the lights go out?

1117
01:18:16,492 --> 01:18:20,663
"Oh, girlfriend.! Oh, girlfriend.!"

1118
01:18:20,746 --> 01:18:23,708
Shots fired.!

1119
01:18:27,420 --> 01:18:30,047
- Uncuff him now!
- What? What the hell?

1120
01:18:30,131 --> 01:18:33,676
What in God's name?
Have you lost your mind, young lady?

1121
01:18:33,759 --> 01:18:36,095
I said uncuff
Jack Hammond now!

1122
01:18:36,220 --> 01:18:40,766
Come on, Miss Voss. Put the gun down.
You don't know what you're doing.

1123
01:18:40,892 --> 01:18:42,894
This guy's brainwashed you.
Now come on.

1124
01:18:42,977 --> 01:18:48,191
- Ned, get a shot of this!
- Natalie, stop embarrassing me.

1125
01:18:48,274 --> 01:18:51,110
Do it, or I'll blow his brains out
all over live TV.

1126
01:18:51,235 --> 01:18:54,739
Miss Voss, don't do it.
You're confused. He's confused you.

1127
01:18:54,864 --> 01:18:56,866
- It's very confusing.
- Don't move!

1128
01:18:56,949 --> 01:19:00,036
I said, don't move.!

1129
01:19:14,550 --> 01:19:16,469
I mean business.

1130
01:19:16,552 --> 01:19:20,807
Goddamn it.! Would you think about what
you're doing.! This guy's a scumbag.!

1131
01:19:20,932 --> 01:19:24,310
He doesn't want you! He's only using you!
Come on! Put the gun down!

1132
01:19:24,435 --> 01:19:26,395
Back away from Jack now!

1133
01:19:38,199 --> 01:19:41,911
- You've gone completely crazy. You know that?
- Thanks for noticing.

1134
01:19:41,994 --> 01:19:45,122
How do you plan to get us
out of this one?

1135
01:19:45,206 --> 01:19:47,166
Watch me and weep.

1136
01:19:51,671 --> 01:19:53,840
It takes all kinds, Dalt.

1137
01:19:55,216 --> 01:19:57,301
Okay, Bill, Wendy,
I hope you're getting this.

1138
01:19:57,426 --> 01:20:00,346
They are walking directly
towards the helicopter...

1139
01:20:00,429 --> 01:20:03,141
and they're staring at me
like a couple of crazed dogs.

1140
01:20:03,224 --> 01:20:05,518
I'm gonna try to get a word
from them if I can.

1141
01:20:05,643 --> 01:20:07,645
This is unbelievable,
ladies and gentlemen. This...

1142
01:20:07,728 --> 01:20:10,481
- Oh, my... - Get out of there.
- Let's go, pal. Let's go.

1143
01:20:10,565 --> 01:20:12,775
- I'm being asked...
- Come on! Go! Go!

1144
01:20:12,859 --> 01:20:15,486
I'm being removed from my own helicopter,
ladies and gentlemen.

1145
01:20:15,611 --> 01:20:17,363
The first margarita's on me.

1146
01:20:21,784 --> 01:20:24,537
Not so fast.

1147
01:20:24,662 --> 01:20:27,623
Did you get it?
Did you? Yes!

1148
01:20:29,208 --> 01:20:32,295
I want big!
I want cinematic!

1149
01:20:32,378 --> 01:20:35,047
I want...
I want Pennebaker.!

1150
01:20:35,173 --> 01:20:38,551
Get this. Get the copter.

1151
01:27:47,313 --> 01:27:49,232
You smell that?

1152
01:27:49,315 --> 01:27:51,234
Do you smell that?

1153
01:27:51,317 --> 01:27:54,153
Nothing else in the world
smells like that, son.

1154
01:27:54,237 --> 01:27:56,531
I love the smell of napalm
in the morning.

1155
01:27:56,656 --> 01:27:58,658
You know one day
we had a hill bombed.

1156
01:27:58,783 --> 01:28:01,994
When I walked out, we didn't find
one of them. Not one stinking dink body.

1157
01:28:02,078 --> 01:28:06,415
But that smell.
That gasoline smell. The whole hill.

1158
01:28:06,499 --> 01:28:09,585
It smelled like... victory.

1159
01:28:11,254 --> 01:28:27,937
