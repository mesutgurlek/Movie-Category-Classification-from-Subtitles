Bingo caller:

00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:32,200
Um, looks like we might
get some rain.

25
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:35,560
Bingo caller: N-40, that's
40 under the "N".

26
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:37,000
Huh?

27
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,520
The --

28
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:40,480
Oh, I'm sorry, I --

29
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:41,720
My mistake, I thought
you were someone else.

30
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:44,240
No, no, wait a minute,
kid, kid, kid...

31
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:46,680
I forgot what
I was supposed to say,

32
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:47,720
Y'know, like, uh...

33
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:49,320
"The rain's good
for the farmers,"

34
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:51,040
"Grow some crops,"
some shit like that.

35
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:52,240
Mr. Burmeister?

36
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:54,440
Yeah, Burmeister. Sit down.

37
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:00,800
Oh, hey, I, uh --
I brought the money.

38
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:02,680
Pss-pss-pss-- later.

39
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:03,680
Oh! Yeah.

40
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:06,560
You're dealing with a professional here.

41
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:07,760
Bingo.

42
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:09,960
Hey, a man's
gotta do somethin'.

43
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,760
Besides, it's
too early in the day

44
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:12,880
to be chasin' pussy.

45
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:25,000
Carl Harding. Sorry I'm late.

46
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:26,400
It's your hour.

47
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:27,720
50 minutes. But who's counting, right?

48
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:33,000
So, Carl, why don't you --

49
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:34,200
I'm sorry, before we begin,

50
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:36,560
Um, please make sure that
the bills go to my office,

51
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:37,840
not to my house.

52
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:39,040
- Sure.
- Thank you.

53
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:41,720
So why don't you
start at the beginning,

54
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:44,320
and tell me why
you've come to see me.

55
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:45,560
Right.

56
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:48,000
You wanna hear about
my mom and my childhood,

57
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,200
is that the kinda shit
you're looking for?

58
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:50,920
If that's why you're here.

59
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:51,680
No, it's not.

60
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:52,840
What do I look like?

61
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:54,320
Just to set
the record straight,

62
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:55,560
I Just made partner

63
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:57,040
at the second-largest law firm
in the state,

64
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:58,120
so I'm doing very well, thank you.

65
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:01,000
So I don't
mean to brag, but you asked.

66
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:03,480
No I didn't.

67
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:05,320
- Okay.

68
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:08,000
So you're here because...?

69
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,640
- I'm here because

70
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:13,240
I've got this thing
going on with a woman --

71
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,400
not my mom!

72
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:16,240
It's not.

73
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,280
# A wanted man in Albuquerque #

74
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:22,760
# A wanted man in Syracuse #

75
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:25,960
# A wanted man in Tallahassee #

76
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:29,040
# A wanted man in Baton Rouge #

77
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:32,200
Got a minute?

78
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:35,720
Uh, in a second.

79
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:36,840
Come on.

80
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:39,240
I hope this
is important, Charlie,

81
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:41,040
I've got Junior choir practice
in twenty minutes.

82
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:42,240
I need to talk.

83
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:43,480
This won't keeptill confession?

84
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:45,440
I really need some helpwith this.

85
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:48,200
Is it a woman?

86
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,120
Charlie:
I'm so glad you could helpme with this.

87
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:02,480
I don't know what to do,

88
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:04,240
I knew you'd helpme
sort this out.

89
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:05,920
I'm here for you, Charlie,
no matter what it is.

90
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,520
Now, Just take your time,

91
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:08,960
and tell me everything
about this woman.

92
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:10,200
I got all day.

93
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:13,280
I don't usually do
this sort of thing.

94
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:14,280
Uh-huh.

95
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:16,800
I've never done this before, y'know?

96
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:18,040
That's okay, sweetie.

97
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:20,120
You can start with the next game
on the green sheet.

98
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:22,120
It's four-card crazy bingo.

99
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:23,800
Ten dollars.

100
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:25,160
Lemme get two cups of coffee, please.

101
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:27,720
Oh, uh, yeah. Two cups for me, too.

102
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:29,920
O-76...

103
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:34,480
0-55, 0-5-5.

104
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:36,280
Y-y-you gotta know, um...

105
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:39,560
I got my reasons for doing this.

106
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:40,720
Well, that's nice.

107
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,240
- See, not too long ago,

108
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:44,480
my life was goin' along Just fine.

109
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:46,960
I was happy...

110
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:48,640
Mm-hmm.

111
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:50,480
Well, maybe I wasn't happy,

112
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:52,360
but, y'know, I was content.

113
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:55,360
I had a Job, I had friends...

114
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:58,080
I had a house...

115
00:04:58,200 --> 00:04:59,680
I had everything but --

116
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:01,480
That steady bang, huh?

117
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:05,680
"She," the squeeze, the girlfriend --

118
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:06,960
whatever you wanna call a chick.

119
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:09,080
Yeah, right.

120
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:12,960
And then I met her....

121
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:16,120
This whole thing
started one night at McCools

122
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:19,600
The place was packed,
even my cousin Carl was there,

123
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:21,360
and I was in the zone

124
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:23,040
Everybodys got their power base --

125
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:25,480
pouring drinks is my speciality

126
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:26,920
I was puttin on quite a show

127
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,200
for the frat boys
at the end of the bar

128
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:30,760
Awright, who wants to take the plunge?

129
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:32,800
I want it!

130
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:35,720
Awright, I know
its only bartending,

131
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:37,000
but hey,
I m good at it

132
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:40,400
Randy: Awright, folks ,
let's go, wrapit up.

133
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:41,320
- What a setup!

134
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:44,280
You must get laid
like...all the time.

135
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:45,280
- Oh, yeah.

136
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:47,880
The girls are
linin' uparound the block.

137
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,400
Fuck, I knew it!

138
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:50,520
They Just can't resist a man

139
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:51,960
working for tips in the service industry.

140
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:54,000
Tell me!
Gimme, gimme, gimme...

141
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:55,960
Y'know, Carl, I appreciate
your comin' down here

142
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:57,160
and gettin' shit-faced drunk, but --

143
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:58,200
Haaa!!!

144
00:05:58,200 --> 00:05:59,240
Don't you think it's about time

145
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:01,960
you went home to Karen and the kids?

146
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:03,440
Well, that would be a good idea,

147
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:05,960
except they're
visiting Grandma in Ohio.

148
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:07,520
What about that thing called a Job?

149
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:10,560
You might wanna go home
and sober upfor an hour or two

150
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:12,080
before goin' in
and facing the partners

151
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:14,560
of Do-We Cheat-Em And How.

152
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:17,080
Close. You must mean
Ragsdale, Hersch & Klein.

153
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:19,080
Take a card, young man,
because you never know.

154
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:21,120
Oh! What are you
tryin' to do,

155
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:22,400
you tryin' to
get rid of me?

156
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:25,160
Hey! Let's go
to one of those after hours clubs.

157
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:27,680
They got these long,
long- legged girls there,

158
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:29,760
you can look at them
and maybe touch them.

159
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:31,360
I gotta close up.

160
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:32,520
You think Just 'cause I'm married

161
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:34,080
I don't know about these places?

162
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:35,560
Just because you are married

163
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:37,360
means you're gettin' it
a whole lot more than me.

164
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:39,960
That's a depressing thought.

165
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:42,440
Carl, you need me
to call you a cab?

166
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:44,040
Oh, no...

167
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:45,400
you Just sobered me uppretty good.

168
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:47,280
Get home safe.

169
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:51,560
It had been
a fairly busy night

170
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:53,480
so by the time
I closed the register

171
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:55,160
and cleaned upthe Joint,

172
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:57,480
all I wanted to do
was go home

173
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:02,560
Woman:
Where are you going?!

174
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:04,040
Stopthe car!!!

175
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:05,360
Man:
Do you hear what I'm tellin' ya?!

176
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:06,520
Don't touch me!!!

177
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:08,120
Get over here!!!

178
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:09,600
Let go of me!!!

179
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:11,480
Hey!

180
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:14,360
Awright, go!

181
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:29,720
Driver:
Fuck you!!!

182
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:33,720
And there she was...

183
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:40,120
This is not the kind of girl

184
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:43,080
you usually run into
In a dark alley

185
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:46,480
In fact, this is not
the kind of girl

186
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:48,640
I ever run into

187
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:52,600
You okay?

188
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:54,720
Girl:No, I'm not okay.

189
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:57,680
Some smelly guy
Just tried to rape me.

190
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:59,200
- What a Jerk! Here.

191
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:01,560
You want me to
call the police?

192
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:03,400
I-I know you're Just
trying to help,

193
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:04,640
but spending
the rest of the night

194
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:06,200
with a bunch of ass hole cops

195
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:08,720
isn't exactly what I need right now.

196
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:10,360
Your...

197
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:13,080
Thanks.

198
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:19,360
You got a smoke?

199
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:21,200
Huh? No, sorry.

200
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:23,080
This really is my night.

201
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:25,160
I bet I could
find you one in the bar.

202
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:26,360
It's okay.

203
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:28,640
I'm tryin' to cut down anyway.

204
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:36,160
You're gonna be okay?
- Yeah.

205
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:38,400
Okay, alright.
I'll see you around.

206
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:40,840
Hey!

207
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:43,840
What are you doin' right now?

208
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:45,080
- Whaddya mean?

209
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:46,120
Well, I mean, look,

210
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:48,960
I Just had this little
unpleasant experience,

211
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:51,720
and I don't especially
feel like being by myself.

212
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:53,440
Right, right.

213
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:55,960
Well, I was Just gonna go home.

214
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,960
You got a stereo?

215
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:00,920
Well, I got a boom box.

216
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:03,520
Only one of the speakers
is workin', so...

217
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:05,280
I don't know if
you call it a stereo.

218
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:08,080
You wanna go
listen to some music?

219
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:10,640
Where's your car?

220
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:12,920
Actually, I Just live
a couple of blocks --

221
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:15,480
Hun --no car.
- Sorry.

222
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:16,840
Hey.

223
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:23,520
So, do you live
in a house or an apartment?

224
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,440
Well, this is it.

225
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:39,240
You live here alone?

226
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:42,960
It was my mother's before she died.

227
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,680
You own it?

228
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:46,600
Yeah.

229
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:50,680
Oh, you're so lucky.

230
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:53,120
I've always dreamt
of having my own place.

231
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:01,120
I know what you're thinking --

232
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:03,280
The police station
might be cheerier, huh?

233
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:04,760
It's great.

234
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:05,880
Yeah.

235
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:12,200
Lot of potential.

236
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:14,640
"A lot of potential."

237
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:16,960
What is she,
a real estate agent?

238
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,520
Can I get you something to drink?

239
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:21,000
Uh, tapwater,

240
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:23,040
I got beer,

241
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:25,320
I got tapwater,

242
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:26,680
I think I got...

243
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:28,920
Uh...

244
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,360
I may have a Yoo-Hoo .

245
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:31,960
- Beer sounds good.

246
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,720
I forgot. I drank
the last one this morning.

247
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:38,400
Uh, I can make some tea

248
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:39,920
or, uh, coffee...

249
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:41,960
That's fine, thanks.

250
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:44,120
Well, tea, anyway.

251
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:46,160
Water's fine.
Maybe some ice?

252
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:47,720
Water.

253
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:51,200
Ah...

254
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:53,440
Sorry, no, uh,

255
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:54,760
no ice.

256
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:56,960
My freezer's on the blink.

257
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:01,120
How is it?

258
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:02,160
What?

259
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:03,040
The water.

260
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:05,000
Fine.

261
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:11,760
Do you like water?

262
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:13,160
I love it.

263
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:16,320
It's actually
my second favorite thing in the world.

264
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:18,280
Really? And what's
your first favorite?

265
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:19,720
Fucking.

266
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:36,640
What?!

267
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:39,720
It's my mom's room.

268
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:44,440
# The way you move
your sexy body #

269
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:47,200
# It makes me want to
get to know you #

270
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:49,800
# A little bit better #

271
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:51,400
# The way you move #

272
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:54,480
# Your sexy body #

273
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:56,840
# Makes me want to
get to know you #

274
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:59,480
# A little bit better #

275
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:00,920
# Girl will make your moves #

276
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:02,960
# Straight through your heart
stingin' on point #

277
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:04,360
# Like a game of darts #

278
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:07,320
# Your sexy figure
it makes me figure #

279
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:09,520
# How to get close to you
and make your coochie shook #

280
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:11,680
# I'm so into you
I can feel ya groove #

281
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:14,680
# Don't hold back
Just make your move #

282
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:15,920
# The way you move #

283
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:18,880
# Your sexy body #

284
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:21,200
# Makes me want to
get to know you #

285
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:23,720
# A little bit better...#

286
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:29,960
A woman after
my own heart -- heh-heh.

287
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:31,640
Hun-hun.

288
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:36,120
You have no idea
what this woman is capable of.

289
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:38,880
I guess you don't have to
worry about that anymore,

290
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:40,520
do you?

291
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:42,360
I don't think of myself
as the kind of person

292
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:43,880
who's in this kind of office.

293
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,520
When I think about people
who are in therapy,

294
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:50,040
these are people who don't
have their lives in control.

295
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:52,680
I am --
I'm in control of my life,

296
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:54,560
my life is-is in control,

297
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:56,440
that is not a problem for me.

298
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:58,640
What about the woman
you mentioned?

299
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:01,960
Right. Uh...

300
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:08,920
It started
one night at McCool's...

301
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:11,680
Its a kind of
a low-rent Joint

302
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:13,640
Ordinarily I would
never be seen dead

303
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:15,440
in a place like this

304
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:18,200
Hey! Who wants to take the plunge?

305
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:20,480
But on this particular night,

306
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:24,120
Karen had taken the kids
to Ohio to visit her mom

307
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:25,920
So I decided to
dropin on my cousin,

308
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:28,160
who I hadn't seen
in a long time

309
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:29,680
We re talking about

310
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:31,240
an adult
who thinks it's fun

311
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:33,160
to drink out of
a toilet plunger.

312
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:35,920
I mean, this is
the mentality we're dealing with here.

313
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,720
Let's Just stay focused
on the woman, okay?

314
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:39,520
Right.

315
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:41,240
The woman, okay

316
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:43,280
Well, I look across the room

317
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:45,400
and I saw

318
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:54,280
...a very beautiful woman.

319
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:59,360
I hung around
hoping shed come back,

320
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:00,480
but she didn t

321
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:02,520
Okay, time for me to go.

322
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:04,920
It was pretty late,

323
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:07,320
and I d had a few drinks

324
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:11,280
And there she was

325
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:13,120
Girl:
I'm Just a little bit nervous.

326
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:14,480
How do I look?

327
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:16,040
She was with this guy,

328
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:17,800
and I thought maybe
this is not the best time

329
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:19,760
to hit on
this particular woman

330
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:21,400
What is this ,
PMS week?

331
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:24,360
So I got in my car and

332
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:26,960
I don't know, I started
to doze off a little,

333
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:29,200
and I hear all this
screaming and cursing.

334
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:32,120
Girl:
Don't touch me, asshole!

335
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:33,520
I'm gettin' out!

336
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:35,560
Bartender:
Hey!!!

337
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:48,480
Wow.

338
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:52,800
Tits.

339
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:53,920
Driver:
Fuck you!

340
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:55,680
Therapist:
And you didn't try to help?

341
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:56,920
Oh, I would have.

342
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:58,440
But?

343
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:01,120
I may have fallen asleep.

344
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:02,800
You should know --

345
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:05,040
I was practically
forced into this.

346
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:06,680
Bartender:
Jewel?

347
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,680
Jewel?

348
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:17,120
I, uh...

349
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:18,920
I suppose
it's not gonna help

350
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:21,080
If i tell you
that was really amazing?

351
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:22,880
I know it was.

352
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:24,560
That's the problem.

353
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:29,560
To tell ya the truth...

354
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:32,480
I only took
one psychology course

355
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:34,480
in Junior college,

356
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:36,680
I know there's
supposed to be this thing

357
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:41,240
where you're sad
or you're guilty after...

358
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:43,640
Well, I personally
don't suffer from that.

359
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:45,680
It's not that.

360
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:47,160
Don't you see?

361
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:49,280
That guy tonight --

362
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:51,440
Oh -- oh, that creep
in the firebird?

363
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:53,720
I know that guy.

364
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:55,440
Of course
you know the guy.

365
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:57,280
Let's face it,
you're not the type of girl

366
00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:00,160
who Just Jumps into a car
with some smelly guy

367
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:01,880
that you don't even know,

368
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:03,560
I know that.

369
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:04,960
No....

370
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:07,160
He and I are...

371
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:08,920
doing this...

372
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:10,160
thing.

373
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:13,600
Oh, shit, I really like you.

374
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:15,480
What do you mean by "thing"?

375
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:18,840
He and I get in this fight,

376
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:22,080
and then you or whoever

377
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:24,040
comes to my rescue

378
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:26,920
and takes me home, and then...

379
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:30,520
He like shows up
and we rob you.

380
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:31,600
What?

381
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:34,560
We rob you.

382
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:36,400
I mean, do you believe that?

383
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:39,160
I'm shocked.

384
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:40,680
I-I take it this is

385
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:42,640
something that
you-you've done before?

386
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:44,480
Just a couple of times.

387
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:46,200
I know it sounds sick,

388
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:48,280
but you don't know Utah, he's nuts.

389
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:50,800
How does he know
where we are, anyway?

390
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:52,920
I'm supposed to
call him and tell him.

391
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:55,680
You-you haven't
done that yet, have you?

392
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:57,920
Of course not!

393
00:16:57,920 --> 00:16:59,040
Oh, good.

394
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:00,880
Good...

395
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:02,880
Um...okay.

396
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,840
I got it.

397
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:06,120
Don't call him.

398
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:09,640
Let's call the police instead.

399
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:14,760
Not if you ever
want to see me again.

400
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:17,400
Oh, right.

401
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:18,960
Y'know, I generally

402
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:21,920
think better
with my shoes on, so...

403
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:30,040
This guy Utah,
is he a mormon?

404
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:32,280
Uh, I wouldn't say that.

405
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:34,160
Oh. I didn't think so.

406
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:39,480
You know, this guy...

407
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:42,280
He sounds like
a ma Jor piece of shit, you know?

408
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:43,440
You wouldn't be
talkin' about me,

409
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:45,400
would ya, loverboy?

410
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:49,800
Wh-why didn't you call?

411
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:51,840
I was Just about to.

412
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:55,040
Has this guy
got anything worth takin'?

413
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:57,480
Old TV, a VCR.

414
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:58,480
He's got a boom box,

415
00:17:58,520 --> 00:18:00,120
but only one speaker works.

416
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:01,880
A Mr Coffee machine.

417
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,640
Telephone, um...

418
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:06,840
Oh yeah, and one light
hooked upto the clapper.

419
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:11,800
Hey, that was my mom's.

420
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:13,600
Shut your fuckin' mouth!

421
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:16,680
You stand there,
you call me a piece of shit!

422
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:19,600
Huh? I'm the piece of shit?

423
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:23,040
I'm here with my lady,
you understand?

424
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:25,400
It is a touchy situation!

425
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:27,800
Has he got a car?

426
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:28,920
No.

427
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:30,080
No?

428
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:32,080
He's pathetic!

429
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:34,520
You-you don't
got a car?

430
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:36,440
Everybody's
got a car today --

431
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:40,160
Even bums don't
not got a car!

432
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:41,880
What do you do when
you take a chick out,

433
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:43,000
you go on a bus?

434
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:45,280
Think you're gonna
get laid on a bus?

435
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:46,560
Think you're gonna
give some chick

436
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:48,600
the fuckin' monster on a bus?

437
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:50,160
Huh?

438
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:54,120
I got a car...

439
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:56,280
The "piece of shit's" got a car!

440
00:18:57,640 --> 00:18:59,120
What about Jewelry,
has he got Jewelry?

441
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:01,040
Just a Swatch

442
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:03,560
Nice leather band, though.

443
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:06,480
Oh yeah?
Take it off.

444
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:12,400
C'mon, you're so slow.

445
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:14,440
It's right over here.

446
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:17,040
Awright, you're up,
slugger, let's go.

447
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:18,400
You want me to open it?

448
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:20,560
No, I want you
to dance with it --

449
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:21,920
Move!

450
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:23,080
Okay.

451
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:25,640
And if there's
a gun in there, Just leave it.

452
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:27,160
'Cause you'll
pull it out, you'll get nervous,

453
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:29,080
you'll wind upmiss in' me,

454
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:31,600
then I gotta do
what I gotta do with what I got.

455
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:32,640
Look at me.

456
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:34,960
Look at me
when I talk to you!

457
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:37,240
I can't look at you
and look at the safe at the same time.

458
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:39,080
Oh, excuse me, okay.

459
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:41,880
You're the big-shot now,
I'm nobody, right?

460
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:44,400
Okay, I'm over here now.

461
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:46,840
Excuse me.

462
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:51,040
Got any other features
on this watch?

463
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:53,400
It's got a stopwatch.

464
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:54,680
It's got a stopwatch?

465
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:56,480
I never figured out
how to use it.

466
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:58,240
It's simple,
it's this button --

467
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:10,400
Oh....

468
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:27,520
What happened?

469
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:29,640
He was gonna kill you.

470
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:32,240
Really?

471
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:34,200
I mean,
he was Just --

472
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:35,760
He could definitely
tell that there was

473
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:37,480
something going on
between us, y'know?

474
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:38,720
How?

475
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:40,640
Because I've never
actually slept with

476
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:42,680
any of the other guys
that I've done this with before,

477
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:43,920
that's how.

478
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:46,920
Is he dead?

479
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:50,440
Oh, Jesus.

480
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:54,720
Do you hate me now?

481
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:55,960
No, no, no, no.

482
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:57,080
No.

483
00:20:57,080 --> 00:20:58,640
Oh yes, you do!

484
00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:01,000
No, it's not that, okay?

485
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:03,080
It's Just the sex
and the violence

486
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:05,520
all in one night,
it's a little much.

487
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:09,080
- What are we gonna do now?
- What?

488
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:10,520
- What are we gonna do now?!
- I don't know!

489
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:12,440
Well, think of something!

490
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:14,640
Let's call the police.

491
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:16,360
That's a good idea.

492
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:17,880
- Yeah?
- Yeah, really.

493
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:19,640
And what are we
gonna tell 'em?

494
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:21,400
We'll tell them
the truth,

495
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:22,840
I mean, that
he was robbing you

496
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:24,800
and-and I shot him,
and that's that.

497
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:25,880
Yeah.

498
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:27,880
Tell 'em the truth.

499
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:29,200
I like that.

500
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:32,120
Uh, since he was
threatening you,

501
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:34,280
I probably
won't get more than ten years, right?

502
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:35,920
And with good behavior

503
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:40,080
-- I could be out in seven...years.

504
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:45,840
Wait...

505
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:48,600
Um...

506
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:52,640
- Let's come upwith another plan.
- What?

507
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:54,400
I mean, that he
was robbing you

508
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:56,440
and somebody else shot him?
Who?

509
00:21:56,560 --> 00:21:58,720
Well, we could say
that I shot him.

510
00:21:58,840 --> 00:22:00,520
That won't work.

511
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:03,760
It's ridiculous,
it would never work that way, it's--

512
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:06,440
Well, maybe...

513
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:12,680
Well, I mean, let's...

514
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:14,320
Let's go over it.

515
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:15,400
Okay.

516
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:17,400
- He was robbing the place.
- Yes.

517
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:19,600
- He did get shot, right?
- Mm-hmm.

518
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:21,520
So that's
two out of three.

519
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:24,240
What's that,
that's sixty-seven percent true,

520
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:27,400
I mean, that's
pretty good these days, right?

521
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:28,960
Right.

522
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:38,520
That's some first date,
killin' her boyfriend.

523
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:42,160
Well, it gave
the relationship a certain intensity.

524
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:49,280
Charlie:
It all started one night at McCools

525
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:51,120
Earl Raymond Pitts.

526
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:54,000
Had a list of priors
goin' back to the womb.

527
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:55,240
Seriously.

528
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:57,880
He was born in
Dwight Correctional.

529
00:22:57,880 --> 00:23:00,080
His mother had twins
while she was doin' a bit for narcotics.

530
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:01,360
You mean
there's another one out there like him?

531
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:03,120
Huh. Yeah.

532
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:04,640
He went by the name "Utah."

533
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:06,920
"Utah" ...
The Mormon State?

534
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,320
Yeah. Don't ask me.

535
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:15,760
I'm a little unclear on this.

536
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:17,200
He was holding
a gun on you,

537
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:18,800
But you were able
to get your gun

538
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:21,560
and shoot him point-blank
in the back of the head?

539
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:22,920
Yeah, right.

540
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,160
It-it all happened
kinda fast.

541
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:26,640
So...

542
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:28,680
he was standing
in front of you,

543
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:31,520
and then...what?

544
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:32,520
He heard something?

545
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:33,880
Right.

546
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,760
He turned around,
you grabbed your gun...

547
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:38,320
Right.

548
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:39,440
Which was where?

549
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:40,600
Uh...

550
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:42,640
- Hidden next to the safe?
- Right.

551
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:44,920
Just in case
something like this ever happened.

552
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:47,440
He turned around,
you grabbed your gun, and pow!

553
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:50,360
Exactly --
that's exactly how it happened.

554
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:57,360
About what time was this?

555
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:58,640
Huh?

556
00:23:58,720 --> 00:23:59,880
About what time
was this?

557
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:01,800
Oh, uh...

558
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:05,640
Just before I called 911 .

559
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:07,680
Thanks.

560
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:10,960
Hey.

561
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:14,400
It's res ponsible citizens
Just like yourself

562
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:16,560
that make my Job
a lot easier.

563
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:23,920
You can imagine my mood,

564
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,720
getting roused
from a sound sleep

565
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:28,600
to go scoopsome citizen
off a barroom floor

566
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:30,240
- You wanna talk to the lady?
- What lady?

567
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:31,960
His.

568
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:34,160
Does she have
anything to do with it?

569
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:36,160
Nah, she was
waitin' for him back at their house,

570
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:37,400
he didn't show,
she got worried,

571
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:39,120
came here
lookin' for him.

572
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:40,680
Let her go.

573
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:42,000
Awright.

574
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:43,440
You're free
to go, miss.

575
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:50,720
Suddenly
my whole life changed

576
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:58,120
Like Theresa had
come back from the dead

577
00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:04,680
She even looks
a little like Theresa.

578
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,280
So this girl,
she's good in the sack, huh?

579
00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:10,120
I'm sorry, man,
you get my age,

580
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:12,120
you like to hear
about the old un!

581
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:13,400
Sorry.

582
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:16,000
- O-18, 1-8 under the "O".

583
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:18,280
Nice ass?

584
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:22,440
Mr. Chick Fife,
telephone call.

585
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:25,120
Mr. Chick Fife, please
call your cardiologist.

586
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:27,240
You takin' the rap
for the shooting

587
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:29,000
musta worked out okay.

588
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:31,760
Your boss, he musta
treated you like a hero.

589
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:36,640
Oh, kid....

590
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:39,160
Death and good times,

591
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:40,920
they don't mix.

592
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:43,000
I can't have people
comin' in here

593
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:44,240
lokin' for a good time,

594
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:45,480
seein' you and thinkin',

595
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:47,000
"uh-oh, that's the one

596
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:48,360
"that put a bullet
in the guy's head.

597
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:49,920
"Maybe he's gonna serve me

598
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:51,400
"my strawberry daiquiri
and onion rings,

599
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:54,000
"or maybe he's gonna
go postal on my ass!!!"

600
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,040
Joey, the guy was
tryin' to rob your bar.

601
00:25:56,120 --> 00:25:57,560
He didn't take nothin'!

602
00:25:57,640 --> 00:25:59,360
You put a bullet
in his friggin' noggin!

603
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:00,600
You're gone! Go!!!

604
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:04,880
Hello!

605
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:07,120
Wh-what are you doin'?

606
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:09,640
What does it look like?
I'm ironing.

607
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,360
We're not there yet, are we?

608
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:14,800
What do you mean
we're not there yet?

609
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:17,360
We're movin' a little fast here, Jewel.

610
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:19,640
- Yeah?
- Hi, how ya doin'. Need your signature.

611
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:22,280
- What's this?
- 1-800-Mattress.

612
00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:24,520
I didn't order
any mattress.

613
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:29,840
Dammit!

614
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:34,040
How are we supposed
to pay for this stuff?!

615
00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:35,200
Jewel:
God, Randy, I Just thought

616
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:36,800
we really had something,

617
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:38,800
or at least the start of something.

618
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:40,760
But obviously
I'm incredibly stupid.

619
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:42,040
You're not stupid.

620
00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:43,800
I'll be out of your life
in Just a few minutes.

621
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:45,480
I didn't say
I wanted you out of my life.

622
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:46,640
Ha!

623
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:48,920
It's Just...with the ironing,

624
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:49,920
the-the new mattress,

625
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:51,520
they all Just
seem like things

626
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:53,040
that are a little further
down the line,

627
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:54,440
that's all.

628
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:55,840
Further
down the line

629
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:58,120
than all the sex
we've been having?

630
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:02,640
Any further down the line
than killing Utah together?

631
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:05,120
You're right...

632
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:07,080
you know what, it's me.

633
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:08,640
I lost my Job today.

634
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:12,520
You what?

635
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:14,000
I got canned.

636
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:18,760
Oh, baby,
why didn't you say so?

637
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:21,480
Aw...
are you okay?

638
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:23,040
I guess.

639
00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:24,760
Oh....

640
00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:30,920
Mmm....

641
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,600
Oh, your cousin called.

642
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:34,480
The lawyer.

643
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:36,680
We're going over
to his house on Saturday

644
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:38,800
for a barbecue.

645
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:43,240
So Carl invites me
over to his house for a barbecue.

646
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:45,080
Now, Carl never
invites me over,

647
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:47,240
so I'm thinkin'
to myself, why now?

648
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:55,600
Here you go.

649
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:56,200
That's sweet.

650
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:57,800
Thanks.

651
00:27:57,800 --> 00:27:59,840
That is some
ma Jor league pussy.

652
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:01,160
Ha ha ha!

653
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:02,880
I meant that
in a good way.

654
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:05,040
You bangin' her?

655
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:07,080
She must have
fucked you senseless

656
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:08,800
when she found out
you shot a guy?

657
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:11,760
Because I read that
women cream for the violence.

658
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:13,200
I don't know
what that is.

659
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:15,400
When you're fuckin' her, though,
because she's so young, is it --

660
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:17,280
I'm gonna see if
they want some helpin the kitchen.

661
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:18,280
I'm Just asking.

662
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:19,600
I mean, look at her!

663
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:21,480
It's like havin'
a porn star in my house!

664
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:23,320
Except she's
makin' salad.

665
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:25,360
You have such
a beautiful house -- it's so homey.

666
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:27,280
That's all Karen,
believe me.

667
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:29,880
I wanted to go with
lots of stainless steel,

668
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:31,240
something we could Just
pssh! Hose it right off.

669
00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:32,400
A lot of this stuff
we don't even use,

670
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:34,160
so if you really
like it, take it.

671
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:35,600
Thank you, Jewel.

672
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:38,840
It's always been my dream
to have a real nice house.

673
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:41,000
I already know exactly
what it'll look like --

674
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:43,840
Wall-to-wall carpeting
with matching drapes,

675
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:46,720
and a big, fluffy white couch,

676
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:48,840
nice dining room set,

677
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:51,360
and in the corner...

678
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:53,040
a fountain.

679
00:28:58,480 --> 00:28:59,520
A fountain?

680
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:00,840
It's gonna be...

681
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:01,880
It's gonna be great.

682
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,800
It's of a little girl
washing her hair

683
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:07,080
and the water runs off
into a giant sea shell

684
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:09,160
with goldfish
swimming in it.

685
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:13,240
I didn't Just make it up,
I saw it in a magazine.

686
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:14,560
Better Homes
and Fountains?

687
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:15,800
Carl!

688
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:18,160
Hey, Randy, you got a fountain
in your place, don't ya?

689
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:19,160
In the living room --

690
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:21,520
Oh no, that's
a leaky toilet.

691
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:23,000
My mistake.

692
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,160
You know what, Carl?
You're not funny -- Just rude.

693
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:27,600
- Let's get together some time.
- That's a good idea.

694
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:28,720
Bye.
Hey, c'mon.

695
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:30,840
Mmm....

696
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:34,440
Okay, okay!
Ha ha ha!

697
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:35,600
Okay.

698
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:38,760
Why don't you
let Carl run you home?

699
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:41,040
No, I'm afraid
that's where your luck runs out.

700
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:43,280
I can't drive,
I've been drinkin'.

701
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:45,000
Would you
buy a car?

702
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:46,280
One of these days.

703
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:48,160
Make him
buy a car, would ya?

704
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:49,320
Let's go catch
that 4:15 bus,

705
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:50,880
Let's get
the hell out of here.

706
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,800
Randy:
Buy a car --

707
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:55,000
I wish he hadn t
put that idea in her head

708
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:02,600
What's this?

709
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:06,080
Oh, a friend of mine's
goin' away for a little while...

710
00:30:08,360 --> 00:30:10,160
So she said
I could borrow it.

711
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:12,600
Well, what happens
when your friend gets back?

712
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:14,400
We're gonna be used
to havin' a car by then.

713
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:15,520
So?

714
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:17,320
- Then we're gonna have to buy one.
- So?

715
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:19,400
It's a bottomless pit
of expenses!

716
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:22,640
You got in surance,
you got repairs, car payments--

717
00:30:22,760 --> 00:30:24,520
You're Just afraid
because now you don't

718
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:27,200
have an excuse
for not finding work, aren't you?

719
00:30:27,280 --> 00:30:29,680
Stopright there,
this has nothing to do with work.

720
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:30,600
Did you know
it's safer to fly

721
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:32,200
than it is
to drive a car?

722
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:33,640
You're upset with me

723
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:35,400
Because I didn't
bring you home a plane?

724
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:37,040
Another thing, if you think

725
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:38,280
I'm gonna be out there

726
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:39,800
with a hose and a bucket of suds

727
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:41,760
to wash the damnthing,
you can forget it -- I'm not that guy.

728
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:44,120
Well, fine.
I'll wash the car.

729
00:30:44,120 --> 00:30:45,680
God, you're
full of shit.

730
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:47,360
What's that?
I'm full of shit?

731
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:48,600
Yes.

732
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:49,960
Lemme tell ya --
I have seen people

733
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,040
leave the bar so drunk
they can't even see,

734
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:53,280
and off they speed

735
00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:55,000
in their giant
sports utility vehicles.

736
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:57,400
Well, you run into
one of these guys out on the street,

737
00:30:57,520 --> 00:31:00,000
and you're gonna die,
and you're gonna die ugly!

738
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:01,800
Would you relax?

739
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:05,520
Christ, look at this house!

740
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:11,400
Uh... I come at
a bad time?

741
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:12,800
Uh, no.

742
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:16,440
Randy:
And then that damndetective dropped in

743
00:31:16,560 --> 00:31:18,960
As if i wasn t
stressed-out enough

744
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:20,080
I'll let you two talk.

745
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:21,560
What'd he want?

746
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:23,960
Oh, you know, he's a cop.

747
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:26,160
They're never satisfied

748
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:28,120
unless they ask you
everything ten times.

749
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:30,760
After that night at McCool's
I was a mess.

750
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:33,560
I couldn't concentrate...

751
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:36,040
I couldn't sleep...

752
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:38,000
I could barely eat.

753
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:41,040
Nothin' deep-fried, anyway.

754
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:42,760
I had this longing...

755
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:47,200
Something inside of me said
I had to see that woman again

756
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:54,760
Boy, was I glad I got there
at that exact moment

757
00:31:54,760 --> 00:31:57,040
He was getting very abusive

758
00:31:57,080 --> 00:32:00,200
You're gonna die,
and you're gonna die ugly!

759
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:04,280
It was like I had been chosen
for a very special assignment

760
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:08,280
Not by the department,
but by a higher power

761
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:11,320
I was being sent
to save her from him

762
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:13,080
Oh...

763
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:15,680
Did I...come at a bad time?

764
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:17,280
Uh, no.

765
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:20,320
Didn't seem possible,

766
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:24,080
but she was even more beautiful
than the night I first saw her.

767
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:27,000
And I said, Good afternoon,

768
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:31,000
then she said,
I Il let you two talk

769
00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:32,800
Then he said --

770
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:34,280
Not bad, huh?

771
00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:37,000
There was something about him
I Just didn't like.

772
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:38,000
According to your statement,

773
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,960
you closed the bar at one-thirty.

774
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:42,200
You didn't call
to report the shooting

775
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:43,800
until three-fifty-eight.

776
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:45,840
I need to know what you were doing during
that time frame.

777
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:48,520
Haven't we already
gone over all this stuff, man?

778
00:32:48,560 --> 00:32:50,760
Hey, uh, Jewel, how about

779
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:53,000
crackin' me open a brew, huh?

780
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,440
I don't know, it was, uh,

781
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:56,400
I had to count all that money,

782
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:58,560
It was a busy-ass night, awright?

783
00:32:58,560 --> 00:32:59,800
I think on this night

784
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:01,400
we had those frat boys in there,

785
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:02,840
and a couple of 'em --

786
00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:04,720
Whoa, whoa -- whaddya doin'?

787
00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:06,000
This guy's a cop.

788
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:07,760
He can't drink,
he's on the Job!

789
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:10,320
Why don't ya do somethin',
y'know, make yourself useful.

790
00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:11,840
All right.

791
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:13,760
I'll be outside --
was hing the car.

792
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:15,200
Yeah, you do that.

793
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:18,520
Man, I'm sorry about her.

794
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:23,720
How can I not
question our Creator

795
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:26,480
for putting this...

796
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:29,720
...human obscenity
into the presence

797
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:32,320
of such a...

798
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:34,360
...divine creature.

799
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:37,440
Anyway, that was the night
we had all these frat boys in

800
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:39,280
and they're
taking "the plunge."

801
00:33:39,320 --> 00:33:41,440
A couple of 'em
ended upin the bathroom

802
00:33:41,560 --> 00:33:44,000
and barfin' up
all over the floor...

803
00:33:44,040 --> 00:33:47,800
I wasn't listening
to a word he was saying

804
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:52,320
I could only
think about her

805
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:53,920
I felt so guilty,

806
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:57,120
like I was betraying
the memory of Theresa

807
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:59,800
but I couldn t
take my eyes off her

808
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:09,800
# Well I think it's time #

809
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:11,760
# To get ready #

810
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:16,760
# To realize
Just what I have found #

811
00:34:18,080 --> 00:34:20,560
# I have been only half #

812
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:23,080
# Of what I am #

813
00:34:23,160 --> 00:34:26,200
# It's all clear to me now #

814
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,800
# My heart is on fire #

815
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:37,600
# My soul's like
a wheel that's turning #

816
00:34:37,720 --> 00:34:41,360
# My love is alive #

817
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:46,080
# My love is alive #

818
00:34:46,200 --> 00:34:48,920
# Yeah yeah yeah #

819
00:34:52,120 --> 00:34:53,880
# Whoo! ##

820
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,000
Can you imagine
how i felt?

821
00:34:58,200 --> 00:35:00,840
You should see
what she does with my hose.

822
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:02,760
I don't know what
would make me

823
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:04,280
invite him over
for barbecue.

824
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:06,360
You did say
you were going to.

825
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:07,400
Hmm?

826
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:08,360
Yeah, but --

827
00:35:08,360 --> 00:35:10,280
I say a lot of things.

828
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:11,880
Why do you
think you did?

829
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,520
I don't know.

830
00:35:13,560 --> 00:35:15,360
You tell me.

831
00:35:15,360 --> 00:35:16,600
The woman?

832
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:20,560
Carl:
You know, he brings her

833
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:23,560
and shes wearing
this nothing of a dress,

834
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:26,440
its a slip!
I mean, you can see everything

835
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:27,960
For a barbecue.

836
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,240
No, no, wait a second,
what am I thinking? Hot pants.

837
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:32,360
They re like
cupping everything,

838
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:34,080
and-and this top--

839
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:36,520
You could definitely
see her stomach

840
00:35:36,520 --> 00:35:38,560
Wait! No, no no --
sorry, it was a dress.

841
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:40,560
It was a dress, like a,
like a summer kind of

842
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:43,160
farmer girl dress, you know?

843
00:35:43,240 --> 00:35:44,880
With like, cherries and plums and --

844
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:46,560
- Okay.
- little fruits.

845
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:48,240
Shes walking
and shes bouncing

846
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:50,000
and the grapes
and the melons,

847
00:35:50,080 --> 00:35:51,320
and they're Just
ba-boom, ba-boom --

848
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:52,360
That's fine,
thank you.

849
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:54,520
She's so sexy,
but pretty!

850
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:56,000
- Okay, all right!
- No!

851
00:35:56,080 --> 00:35:57,800
All right!
That's enough!

852
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:02,280
I get the picture!
Let's Just go on with the story.

853
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:03,400
So then --

854
00:36:04,520 --> 00:36:06,040
In any case,

855
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:08,040
the reason I called you was

856
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:09,800
you're one guy I can trust

857
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:11,800
in a situation like this.

858
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:14,240
I got a guy with a hole
in the back of his head

859
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:15,920
where the exit wound was...

860
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:22,120
# Oh were you Just
pleased to see me #

861
00:36:24,120 --> 00:36:25,920
# As you all know #

862
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,200
# You better take care #

863
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:29,800
# Treat me with respect #

864
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:32,480
# Because love is rare #

865
00:36:32,520 --> 00:36:34,720
# As you all know #

866
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:36,840
# You better beware #

867
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:40,680
# Treat me with respect... ##

868
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:43,400
Um, would anybody care
for another burger?

869
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:45,320
I'll have a hot dog.

870
00:36:45,320 --> 00:36:46,800
If you have one.

871
00:36:49,560 --> 00:36:51,040
And then she grabs me
and she says,

872
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:52,800
Lets get together sometime

873
00:36:55,080 --> 00:36:56,320
So she was
coming on to you?

874
00:36:56,360 --> 00:36:57,560
Yeah.

875
00:36:58,680 --> 00:37:00,560
It doesn't surprise me, really.

876
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:01,760
It doesn't.

877
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:03,120
No, 'cause --

878
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:04,960
I mean, I don't mean
to sound full of myself, but...

879
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:07,360
But what?

880
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:10,080
You're irresistible?

881
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:13,560
Women...
women find me attractive.

882
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:17,000
Do you think
I'm attracted to you?

883
00:37:17,080 --> 00:37:18,560
Well, you're a doctor,

884
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:20,800
so I think you have
that professional reserve.

885
00:37:20,840 --> 00:37:22,360
But even so,

886
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:24,160
I think I felt something
when I walked in the office.

887
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:25,280
It's okay, don't worry about it.

888
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:26,880
You don't wanna
hear about all this.

889
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:28,560
No, no, no --
go on, go on.

890
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:29,560
You got the car,

891
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:32,160
you're feelin' good
about yourself again,

892
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:33,600
and boom!

893
00:37:33,640 --> 00:37:36,520
The sex picks up
again, right?

894
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,160
Well, not exactly.

895
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:43,360
I was watchin a lot of cable

896
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:45,720
- Randy!

897
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:49,800
Randy.

898
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:51,680
Can we talk?

899
00:37:51,720 --> 00:37:52,960
Sure.

900
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:55,360
What did you do all day?

901
00:37:55,360 --> 00:37:57,480
I'm watchin' this
Norwegian movie again,

902
00:37:57,520 --> 00:37:58,800
Maria Marushka

903
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:00,800
It's really good.

904
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:03,240
Randy.. I think
not having a Job

905
00:38:03,320 --> 00:38:05,200
is starting to get to you.

906
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:08,160
No. It's not having any money
that's starting to get to me.

907
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:10,240
Well, that is why
I think we need to talk.

908
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:12,040
With what they pay me
at the store

909
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:13,040
we can barely cover our bills,

910
00:38:13,160 --> 00:38:15,560
not to mention
the new dinette set I want,

911
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:17,440
or the window treatments
I want in this room.

912
00:38:17,480 --> 00:38:19,360
Well, I'm sorry,
there's not much more I can do.

913
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:21,800
I mean, nobody
seems to be hiring.

914
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:23,920
That's why I went
to McCool's today

915
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,920
and spoke to
your old boss, Joey.

916
00:38:25,960 --> 00:38:27,200
What!

917
00:38:27,240 --> 00:38:30,080
You didn't go down there
and-and beg him

918
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:31,600
to give me my Job back!

919
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:33,760
Of course I didn't!

920
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:35,080
Good.

921
00:38:35,120 --> 00:38:36,920
But I am going to
The Moody Blues with him.

922
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:38,240
- What?
- Tomorrow night.

923
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:40,680
He seems to think
they're the Second Coming,

924
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:42,520
but they're really
not my cupof tea.

925
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:44,160
Wait a minute!
Why are you doing this?

926
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:46,920
I'm doing this for us
as a couple, Randy.

927
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:48,920
And more importantly,
I'm doing this for you

928
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:50,280
and your sense
of self-worth.

929
00:38:50,360 --> 00:38:52,200
Huh?

930
00:38:52,280 --> 00:38:55,280
I think that you have
a lot of anger towards Joey,

931
00:38:55,360 --> 00:38:57,160
and that because of that,

932
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:58,760
you feel less of a man

933
00:38:58,760 --> 00:39:00,920
because of his power
to take away your livelihood.

934
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:02,440
You think i'm gonna
have less anger

935
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:04,960
and feel like more of a man
if you start dating this guy?!

936
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:06,360
No.

937
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:10,320
I'm suggesting
that tomorrow night

938
00:39:10,360 --> 00:39:11,840
when you know
he's at the concert,

939
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,080
you go to his house

940
00:39:13,160 --> 00:39:14,720
and you steal
everything of value

941
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:16,800
you can fit into our car.

942
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:17,920
You're Joking.

943
00:39:17,960 --> 00:39:19,080
No.

944
00:39:19,160 --> 00:39:22,960
I mean, come on,
the guy fired you.

945
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:26,240
And he still owes you
six hours overtime, right?

946
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:29,360
I Just don't think he knows
what he had with you.

947
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:30,960
You're so wonderful,

948
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,240
You're the best bartender
I've ever seen, by far.

949
00:39:33,320 --> 00:39:36,520
You know, the way
you worked those crowds,

950
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:39,280
you really had 'em
in the palm of your hand.

951
00:39:39,360 --> 00:39:40,840
You know what
you reminded me of?

952
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:41,760
What?

953
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:45,080
A rock star.

954
00:39:45,160 --> 00:39:46,280
Really?

955
00:39:46,360 --> 00:39:48,000
Really.

956
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:51,760
I don't know...

957
00:39:54,440 --> 00:39:56,280
I Just...

958
00:39:56,360 --> 00:39:58,320
I don't see myself
doing something like that.

959
00:39:58,440 --> 00:39:59,440
It's crazy.

960
00:39:59,560 --> 00:40:01,480
Once we fence
all his stuff,

961
00:40:01,480 --> 00:40:02,840
we'll make a pretty nice
chunk of change.

962
00:40:02,920 --> 00:40:04,760
Look, forget it!

963
00:40:04,840 --> 00:40:06,800
There's no way.

964
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:08,760
Absolutely not.

965
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:12,360
But you did it,
of course.

966
00:40:13,320 --> 00:40:14,760
Yeah, I did it.

967
00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:26,360
I knew Joey would have
A big CD collection

968
00:40:28,360 --> 00:40:30,800
And I was surprised at all
the other cool stuff he had

969
00:40:38,120 --> 00:40:40,040
You know,
Jewel must have taken

970
00:40:40,080 --> 00:40:42,440
a few more psychology courses
than me,

971
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:44,960
because as crazy as I thought
the whole idea was,

972
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:47,920
as reluctant as I was
to do it,

973
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,360
by the end of the evening,
I felt great

974
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:56,280
I still wonder how
she talked me into it.

975
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:59,120
Here's a wild guess.

976
00:41:02,920 --> 00:41:03,960
Yeah.

977
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,720
That probably had
somethin' to do with it.

978
00:41:15,960 --> 00:41:18,600
# I got money in my pocket #

979
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:20,680
# I've got lovin' in the air #

980
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:23,080
# There is nothin'
that will stopme #

981
00:41:23,160 --> 00:41:25,240
# And I really
Just don't care #

982
00:41:25,240 --> 00:41:27,160
# I Just want to
live my life #

983
00:41:27,240 --> 00:41:29,400
# That's the way
it's gonna be #

984
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:32,480
# And nothin's
gonna pull me down #

985
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:34,720
# 'Cause you know
that I believe #

986
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:36,360
# The sun's gonna shine #

987
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:38,360
# Shine #

988
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:42,160
# It's gotta be love
from the very start #

989
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:44,960
# It's gotta be love
from the very start... ##

990
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:46,960
Jewel?

991
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:49,760
The Indian stays.

992
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:52,120
I wasn't gonna
throw him away.

993
00:41:52,120 --> 00:41:53,160
Randy:
For a while there,

994
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:55,160
we almost seemed
like a normal couple

995
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:56,960
Burmeister:
You re slammin it night and day,

996
00:41:56,960 --> 00:42:00,040
poppin' your cork
like a bartender at a mob wedding,

997
00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:02,040
then one day, like it always happens,

998
00:42:02,080 --> 00:42:04,200
all that good nookie turns sour on ya.

999
00:42:04,240 --> 00:42:05,720
Yeah.

1000
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:07,320
What are you doing?

1001
00:42:07,320 --> 00:42:08,680
Oh, nothing. Trash.

1002
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:09,960
Ah-ah-ah.

1003
00:42:10,040 --> 00:42:11,040
Randy, come on,

1004
00:42:11,080 --> 00:42:12,760
we have to throw
some things away.

1005
00:42:12,760 --> 00:42:14,800
But not my
Sno-Globes, come on!

1006
00:42:14,840 --> 00:42:17,280
Can't we Just compromise
and throw one Sno-Globe away?

1007
00:42:17,320 --> 00:42:19,200
Jewel, these
came from my mom.

1008
00:42:19,240 --> 00:42:21,160
See this one here?

1009
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:22,760
She brought it back
from Chicago.

1010
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:24,960
See, it's got
the Sears Tower here,

1011
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:28,200
and this one here
is very special.

1012
00:42:28,280 --> 00:42:30,800
Ya see, my mom
used to say that

1013
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:32,480
this was our house,

1014
00:42:32,600 --> 00:42:34,240
and as long as
I never broke it,

1015
00:42:34,280 --> 00:42:36,800
we'd always have
a place to stay.

1016
00:42:36,920 --> 00:42:40,280
I knew
s he was only Joking, but still...

1017
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:46,080
You're a sick puppy, man.

1018
00:42:46,120 --> 00:42:49,440
So what kind of Job
do you have at this point?

1019
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:51,960
I hadn't got one yet.

1020
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,600
It was sort of
an ongoing problem between us.

1021
00:42:54,720 --> 00:42:56,520
I-29, I-2-9.

1022
00:42:56,560 --> 00:43:00,720
I was offered
the lunch shift at TGl-Friday's...

1023
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:02,600
You lucky stiff.

1024
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:06,320
I actually thought
it was kind of a stepdown

1025
00:43:06,440 --> 00:43:07,960
from unemployment,
I mean...

1026
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:11,080
No, you got it,
you won -- I-29.

1027
00:43:11,160 --> 00:43:12,440
Oh yeah.

1028
00:43:13,560 --> 00:43:15,040
Um..

1029
00:43:15,160 --> 00:43:17,080
Uh, bingo.

1030
00:43:19,240 --> 00:43:21,160
We have a winner!

1031
00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:23,960
I gotta be honest
with you, my young friend.

1032
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,080
I'm leaning towards
the girl on this one,

1033
00:43:26,160 --> 00:43:28,080
I mean, she's made your dump
nice and livable,

1034
00:43:28,200 --> 00:43:29,920
you're gettin'
good action on the mattress...

1035
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,000
Bingo person:
Hold onto it till you cash out.

1036
00:43:32,120 --> 00:43:34,640
Least you could do
is make some money.

1037
00:43:34,720 --> 00:43:36,520
Maybe you should be
playin' bingo.

1038
00:43:36,600 --> 00:43:38,200
That's why...

1039
00:43:38,280 --> 00:43:40,520
we decided
to do another...

1040
00:43:40,560 --> 00:43:43,440
you know, break-in.

1041
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:44,960
What do you mean, "we"?

1042
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:46,440
Yeah, Jewel and me,

1043
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:48,160
I mean, I'm no criminal.

1044
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:50,960
I bet he's got a DVD.

1045
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:52,160
I'd love to
have one of those.

1046
00:43:52,280 --> 00:43:53,160
Whoa.

1047
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:54,760
We're going to Montague's,

1048
00:43:54,760 --> 00:43:56,120
so I borrowed something

1049
00:43:56,200 --> 00:43:57,920
from the designer section
at the store.

1050
00:43:57,960 --> 00:44:00,320
I Just think
you might have overshot,

1051
00:44:00,320 --> 00:44:02,080
I mean,
even for Montague's.

1052
00:44:02,120 --> 00:44:03,040
Really?

1053
00:44:03,080 --> 00:44:03,760
Yeah.

1054
00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:06,960
You know...

1055
00:44:08,360 --> 00:44:10,760
...maybe we shouldn't
be doing this.

1056
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:12,120
The burglary?

1057
00:44:12,240 --> 00:44:14,280
- Yeah.
- Oh, Randy!

1058
00:44:14,360 --> 00:44:16,520
Joey's is one thing,
but this is something else.

1059
00:44:16,520 --> 00:44:19,720
Would you be happier
if we weren't?

1060
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:21,960
Sure, wouldn't you?

1061
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:25,080
I'll show you
what makes me happy.

1062
00:44:32,960 --> 00:44:35,520
These are all
pictures from magazines,

1063
00:44:35,640 --> 00:44:36,760
things I've saved.

1064
00:44:36,840 --> 00:44:40,120
Things that I want
in my house someday.

1065
00:44:40,240 --> 00:44:41,760
I've been carrying this thing

1066
00:44:41,880 --> 00:44:44,080
around with me for years.

1067
00:44:44,120 --> 00:44:48,280
Whenever I feel lonely
or get depressed,

1068
00:44:48,320 --> 00:44:50,760
I Just add in a new couch

1069
00:44:50,760 --> 00:44:53,760
or a new set of drapes and...

1070
00:44:53,840 --> 00:44:55,800
I don't know, Just dream.

1071
00:44:57,520 --> 00:45:00,120
It makes me happy
to think that someday

1072
00:45:00,120 --> 00:45:02,960
I might actually
live in the kind of house

1073
00:45:03,040 --> 00:45:05,320
that looks like
it belongs in a magazine.

1074
00:45:07,480 --> 00:45:10,400
You want me to be happy,
don't you, Randy?

1075
00:45:10,440 --> 00:45:11,760
Of course I do.

1076
00:45:17,240 --> 00:45:19,520
Burmeister:
So who was it this time?

1077
00:45:19,640 --> 00:45:21,000
Randy:
Just some guy --

1078
00:45:21,080 --> 00:45:22,800
God knows how they met

1079
00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:25,440
They were going to some
fancy restaurant, Montagues

1080
00:45:38,760 --> 00:45:41,720
Jewel was sure
she could keephim there

1081
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:43,520
for at least three hours

1082
00:45:43,520 --> 00:45:44,760
It was a good thing, too,

1083
00:45:44,880 --> 00:45:46,520
because it was gonna
take a little time

1084
00:45:46,520 --> 00:45:49,760
to clean this guy out --
he had everything

1085
00:46:01,360 --> 00:46:04,200
At first I couldn't find
his DVD player,

1086
00:46:04,240 --> 00:46:07,960
and I really needed to,
since Jewel wanted one

1087
00:46:12,720 --> 00:46:15,360
So I went upstairs,
and there it was

1088
00:46:15,520 --> 00:46:17,000
DVD!

1089
00:46:19,280 --> 00:46:20,560
Bingo!

1090
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:24,400
Him again?!

1091
00:46:24,520 --> 00:46:28,560
You gotta be careful
when you say "bingo" in here.

1092
00:46:28,680 --> 00:46:30,680
Bingo lady:
Not to worry, that was a false alarm.

1093
00:46:30,760 --> 00:46:31,680
Sorry.

1094
00:46:33,880 --> 00:46:35,520
It was like some game show

1095
00:46:35,560 --> 00:46:38,600
where they send you
on a shopping spree

1096
00:46:38,760 --> 00:46:41,400
I found a nice new Rolex --

1097
00:46:41,520 --> 00:46:43,800
much nicer than
my old Swatch .

1098
00:46:43,920 --> 00:46:47,520
Unfortunately,
this guy was I guess a midget

1099
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:57,760
And then things
started goin wrong

1100
00:46:57,760 --> 00:46:59,320
What's this?

1101
00:46:59,320 --> 00:47:01,240
This is the place
where it all happens, baby.

1102
00:47:01,240 --> 00:47:02,320
Come on.

1103
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:03,320
Mi casa,
es su casa

1104
00:47:03,440 --> 00:47:05,920
Greg! I thought we were
going out somewhere!

1105
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:06,960
Why go out, baby?

1106
00:47:07,040 --> 00:47:08,440
We got it all right here!

1107
00:47:08,520 --> 00:47:10,000
Best sound system
you ever heard,

1108
00:47:10,040 --> 00:47:12,000
a little hot tub,
swimming pool...

1109
00:47:14,680 --> 00:47:16,720
The Gregster might even
break out his secret stash

1110
00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:18,320
of blow.

1111
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:19,520
Uh, Greg...

1112
00:47:19,560 --> 00:47:23,000
Uh, I thought, uh...

1113
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:26,480
Why don't we
Just drive for a little longer,

1114
00:47:26,600 --> 00:47:28,480
this car makes me so hot!

1115
00:47:31,480 --> 00:47:34,760
I'll leave the front door open
if you wanna follow me, okay?

1116
00:48:00,480 --> 00:48:01,760
Jewel:
Greg?

1117
00:48:01,840 --> 00:48:02,880
Score!

1118
00:48:05,240 --> 00:48:06,480
Oh, shit!

1119
00:48:07,440 --> 00:48:08,520
Greg?

1120
00:48:13,120 --> 00:48:14,320
Greg?

1121
00:48:18,760 --> 00:48:20,040
Greg!!!

1122
00:48:26,040 --> 00:48:27,160
Randy!

1123
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:37,160
I had a feeling
you'd find your way.

1124
00:48:37,240 --> 00:48:39,080
This is a nice house.

1125
00:48:39,160 --> 00:48:41,000
Too bad you're
such a shit.

1126
00:48:41,080 --> 00:48:42,480
Heh!

1127
00:48:42,600 --> 00:48:44,080
Greg:
A little dirty-talker.

1128
00:48:44,160 --> 00:48:46,480
Okay, okay,
come on, let's talk.

1129
00:48:46,640 --> 00:48:48,960
Why don't we go downstairs
and have a drink?

1130
00:48:49,120 --> 00:48:51,480
I have a better idea, baby.
Let's talk after.

1131
00:48:52,480 --> 00:48:53,480
Bitch!

1132
00:48:53,560 --> 00:48:55,280
Come on, baby,
come on!

1133
00:48:55,360 --> 00:48:56,520
Get off me!

1134
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:04,000
Ha ha!

1135
00:49:04,040 --> 00:49:05,360
Bitch.

1136
00:49:06,760 --> 00:49:08,200
You like it a little rough, huh?

1137
00:49:08,240 --> 00:49:10,600
Oh, yeah, you wanna play?

1138
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:14,480
We'll play rough.

1139
00:49:15,480 --> 00:49:17,640
We'll play very --

1140
00:49:18,320 --> 00:49:19,040
Ungh!

1141
00:49:36,280 --> 00:49:39,200
Oh, my God,
I don't believe this .

1142
00:49:43,360 --> 00:49:45,360
What is it with you?

1143
00:49:45,480 --> 00:49:47,120
Everywhere you go,
there's a dead guy.

1144
00:49:47,240 --> 00:49:48,280
Take the DVD.

1145
00:49:49,920 --> 00:49:51,320
Take the DVD!

1146
00:49:53,280 --> 00:49:55,040
I'm not takin' the DVD.

1147
00:49:55,080 --> 00:49:56,120
Why not?

1148
00:49:56,240 --> 00:49:57,720
Well, I don't know,

1149
00:49:57,800 --> 00:49:59,600
it Just does n't seem right.

1150
00:49:59,640 --> 00:50:00,960
It was all right before?

1151
00:50:01,040 --> 00:50:04,720
Before there wasn't
a dead guy Iyin' on the floor.

1152
00:50:04,840 --> 00:50:07,000
Y'know, I never
saw a dead person till i met you.

1153
00:50:07,120 --> 00:50:08,480
The guy was
trying to rape me,

1154
00:50:08,600 --> 00:50:09,800
does that mean
anything to you?

1155
00:50:09,920 --> 00:50:10,800
Now take the DVD!

1156
00:50:10,920 --> 00:50:12,760
I'm not takin' the DVD!

1157
00:50:12,760 --> 00:50:15,280
Don't you want to live
in the type of house

1158
00:50:15,400 --> 00:50:17,680
that has a first-rate
home entertainment center,

1159
00:50:17,760 --> 00:50:19,120
including a DVD?

1160
00:50:19,160 --> 00:50:20,720
I already got
his big-screen.

1161
00:50:20,800 --> 00:50:23,040
I don't see the difference
between taking his big-screen

1162
00:50:23,120 --> 00:50:25,560
or taking his DVD --
I want that DVD.

1163
00:50:25,680 --> 00:50:28,680
'Cause the big-screen
is already down in the car.

1164
00:50:31,840 --> 00:50:34,120
Jewel:
I get all dressed up,

1165
00:50:34,200 --> 00:50:35,680
I get a friggin' shiner,

1166
00:50:35,720 --> 00:50:37,240
I don't get dinner,

1167
00:50:37,280 --> 00:50:38,640
and I don't get the DVD --

1168
00:50:40,240 --> 00:50:43,160
Randy:
I didn't care about the TV,

1169
00:50:43,200 --> 00:50:45,040
I was Just doin this
to make Jewel happy

1170
00:50:45,120 --> 00:50:47,480
But you didn't
take the DVD.

1171
00:50:47,480 --> 00:50:50,440
TV: A local attorney
was found slain this morning...

1172
00:50:50,480 --> 00:50:52,800
Jewel:
I do not believe we were in that
gazillion-dollar house

1173
00:50:52,840 --> 00:50:54,480
and we didn't end up
with a thing.

1174
00:50:54,520 --> 00:50:57,120
Did you forget
about the dead guy on the floor?

1175
00:50:57,240 --> 00:50:59,480
No, I did not forget about
the dead guy on the floor,

1176
00:50:59,480 --> 00:51:01,480
but we're not
talking about him right now,

1177
00:51:01,560 --> 00:51:04,080
we're talking about the dead guy
on the floor's stuff,

1178
00:51:04,200 --> 00:51:06,480
and he had a lot of stuff,
stuff we could have taken

1179
00:51:06,480 --> 00:51:08,480
if you weren't such a chickens hit.

1180
00:51:08,480 --> 00:51:09,480
What's that?

1181
00:51:09,520 --> 00:51:12,120
So now
I'm a chicken shit, is that it?

1182
00:51:12,160 --> 00:51:15,480
Yes, I believe that's
the technical term for what you are.

1183
00:51:15,480 --> 00:51:18,920
Yeah, well,
I'd rather be a chicken shit

1184
00:51:18,960 --> 00:51:20,920
than whatever
the hell is it that you are.

1185
00:51:20,960 --> 00:51:22,560
I'm the woman
living with the chicken shit.

1186
00:51:22,680 --> 00:51:24,040
Not for long.

1187
00:51:24,120 --> 00:51:26,480
Yeah, not for long,
that's right,

1188
00:51:26,480 --> 00:51:28,600
because I need a real man,
someone I can count on,

1189
00:51:28,680 --> 00:51:30,800
not a chicken shit like you.

1190
00:51:32,600 --> 00:51:33,920
Ah, good, company.

1191
00:51:35,840 --> 00:51:38,160
TV:
Thus far, police have no leads...

1192
00:51:41,280 --> 00:51:43,440
It's that cop!

1193
00:51:44,440 --> 00:51:46,240
Aren't you glad we don't have

1194
00:51:46,280 --> 00:51:48,440
a lot of stolen stuff
Iyin' around now?

1195
00:51:53,960 --> 00:51:55,320
You're a genius.

1196
00:51:55,360 --> 00:51:57,480
- Hi.
- Morning.

1197
00:51:57,600 --> 00:51:58,840
Thought you'd wanna know

1198
00:51:58,880 --> 00:52:00,720
we closed the investigation
on the shooting at McCool's,

1199
00:52:00,800 --> 00:52:02,160
no charges will be filed.

1200
00:52:02,240 --> 00:52:03,960
We're gonna let you slide
on the unregistered gun

1201
00:52:04,080 --> 00:52:05,880
'cause it was self-defense.

1202
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:06,920
Thanks.

1203
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:08,720
Everything okay, ma'am?

1204
00:52:08,720 --> 00:52:10,760
Yeah. Sure.

1205
00:52:10,840 --> 00:52:13,240
Those are some
pretty nasty bruises.

1206
00:52:13,240 --> 00:52:14,640
Huh?

1207
00:52:15,880 --> 00:52:18,040
Oh yeah, she --
had an accident.

1208
00:52:18,120 --> 00:52:19,400
Accident?

1209
00:52:19,400 --> 00:52:21,640
Would you mind if I
talk to her for a minute?

1210
00:52:21,720 --> 00:52:23,000
Sure.

1211
00:52:24,080 --> 00:52:25,480
Alone?

1212
00:52:25,520 --> 00:52:27,080
Okay.

1213
00:52:30,280 --> 00:52:34,280
At the time, I was glad
Jewel was gonna talk to him

1214
00:52:34,400 --> 00:52:36,280
She knew how to
handle the cops,

1215
00:52:36,320 --> 00:52:37,880
what to say
to get rid of em

1216
00:52:37,960 --> 00:52:40,400
She was good that way

1217
00:52:46,480 --> 00:52:48,200
Whatever happened in there,

1218
00:52:48,200 --> 00:52:50,240
she doesn't want
to talk about it.

1219
00:52:50,240 --> 00:52:52,160
That's 'cause
nothing happened.

1220
00:52:52,200 --> 00:52:54,000
What we do in these
domestic violence situations

1221
00:52:54,080 --> 00:52:55,720
is ask you to
vacate the premises.

1222
00:52:55,720 --> 00:52:57,280
What domestic violence?!

1223
00:52:57,360 --> 00:52:59,200
I will go to a Judge who will
issue a restraining order

1224
00:52:59,280 --> 00:53:00,920
which means you are not
allowed on this property --

1225
00:53:01,040 --> 00:53:02,200
This is my house!

1226
00:53:02,280 --> 00:53:04,200
Or within 100 yards of your wife
until this matter is settled.

1227
00:53:04,200 --> 00:53:05,920
She's not my wife!

1228
00:53:06,040 --> 00:53:08,520
That's too bad --
you'd have more rights if she were.

1229
00:53:08,640 --> 00:53:10,280
You expect me to
Just walk away?

1230
00:53:10,400 --> 00:53:11,960
If you don't, I'm afraid
I'm gonna have to arrest you.

1231
00:53:12,040 --> 00:53:14,160
You can't be serious!

1232
00:53:14,160 --> 00:53:16,920
This-- this--
can't I Just talk to her?

1233
00:53:17,040 --> 00:53:18,480
I don't think that would
be wise at this time, sir.

1234
00:53:18,600 --> 00:53:21,640
Whatever she told you,
she's-- she--

1235
00:53:21,680 --> 00:53:23,160
It's not true,

1236
00:53:23,240 --> 00:53:24,720
y'know, okay?

1237
00:53:27,120 --> 00:53:29,880
Hey, Jewel, honey,
could you come out here, please?

1238
00:53:29,960 --> 00:53:32,240
I could still book you
on the unregistered gun.

1239
00:53:32,400 --> 00:53:33,920
Hun!

1240
00:53:33,960 --> 00:53:35,720
Jewel!

1241
00:53:35,760 --> 00:53:37,800
Would you be kind enough
to tell the police officer

1242
00:53:37,880 --> 00:53:39,720
that I didn't hit you!

1243
00:53:39,720 --> 00:53:41,880
Would you please
tell the officer

1244
00:53:41,960 --> 00:53:43,240
that I didn't
do anything to you?

1245
00:53:43,320 --> 00:53:44,960
Don't make me
use force, sir.

1246
00:53:48,200 --> 00:53:49,800
Jewel!

1247
00:53:50,840 --> 00:53:52,440
Jewel!

1248
00:54:03,280 --> 00:54:05,680
Randy:
I couldn't believe it

1249
00:54:08,880 --> 00:54:12,880
I was so pissed at her
I thought I was gonna explode

1250
00:54:14,280 --> 00:54:16,360
Well, I gotta admit,
she's not perfect.

1251
00:54:16,480 --> 00:54:17,600
Not perfect?!

1252
00:54:20,440 --> 00:54:22,240
Charlie:
She's like this pure, delicate flower,

1253
00:54:22,280 --> 00:54:24,080
I Just wanted
to protect her.

1254
00:54:24,080 --> 00:54:27,640
- But, uh, she was
living with another man.

1255
00:54:27,720 --> 00:54:30,960
- That piece of slime?
he didn't deserve her.

1256
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:32,920
And you did?

1257
00:54:33,840 --> 00:54:35,320
I don't know.

1258
00:54:36,640 --> 00:54:38,040
Oh, Charlie.

1259
00:54:38,160 --> 00:54:40,760
I was totally
cons umed by her.

1260
00:54:40,880 --> 00:54:43,080
My every thought
was of her.

1261
00:54:43,120 --> 00:54:46,200
I was walkin' around in a haze.

1262
00:54:46,280 --> 00:54:47,400
People talked to me,

1263
00:54:47,440 --> 00:54:48,960
but I didn't hear
what they were saying

1264
00:54:49,080 --> 00:54:50,480
Cop:
Gregory Potter Spradling.

1265
00:54:50,600 --> 00:54:54,480
A lawyer at
Ragsdale, Hersch & Klein.

1266
00:54:54,480 --> 00:54:55,960
- What did he do?

1267
00:54:56,080 --> 00:54:57,680
"Do"?

1268
00:54:57,840 --> 00:54:59,720
For a living.

1269
00:54:59,840 --> 00:55:02,680
Lawyer. Ragsdale,
Hersch & Klein.

1270
00:55:02,840 --> 00:55:04,080
- It doesn't
make sense.

1271
00:55:04,200 --> 00:55:06,200
Why would you go
to all the trouble

1272
00:55:06,280 --> 00:55:09,320
of stealing a big-screen TV
and leave a DVD behind?

1273
00:55:09,360 --> 00:55:10,600
Poor guy

1274
00:55:10,720 --> 00:55:12,720
The only thing
goin through my head

1275
00:55:12,760 --> 00:55:13,880
was her

1276
00:55:13,960 --> 00:55:16,040
Everything okay, ma'am?

1277
00:55:16,080 --> 00:55:18,080
Yeah. Sure.

1278
00:55:19,080 --> 00:55:21,720
Those are some
pretty nasty bruises.

1279
00:55:21,840 --> 00:55:24,520
Would you mind if I
spoke to her for a minute?

1280
00:55:24,640 --> 00:55:26,240
Knock yourself out.

1281
00:55:28,440 --> 00:55:30,000
Charlie, what is it?

1282
00:55:30,080 --> 00:55:31,680
Why would God fill me
with this desire

1283
00:55:31,760 --> 00:55:33,480
If I wasn't
meant to be with her?

1284
00:55:36,640 --> 00:55:39,720
Sometimes some time apart
is the best thing.

1285
00:55:41,680 --> 00:55:44,440
I could arrange that.

1286
00:55:44,600 --> 00:55:46,920
Would I get to
stay in the house?

1287
00:55:47,080 --> 00:55:48,600
A temporary
restraining order

1288
00:55:48,720 --> 00:55:51,760
would keephim way
for...90 days.

1289
00:55:51,800 --> 00:55:54,200
But permanently?

1290
00:55:54,280 --> 00:55:56,200
You'd have to get a lawyer.

1291
00:55:56,280 --> 00:55:58,560
Do you know one?

1292
00:55:58,680 --> 00:56:02,680
Yeah. I know one.

1293
00:56:02,680 --> 00:56:03,560
She called you?

1294
00:56:03,680 --> 00:56:05,280
Yes-- I didn't call her.

1295
00:56:05,320 --> 00:56:07,400
She tells me things
are going badly with Randy,

1296
00:56:07,440 --> 00:56:10,040
so I thought
maybe I could helpher out

1297
00:56:10,120 --> 00:56:12,080
and introduce her to
one of the guys in my office.

1298
00:56:12,120 --> 00:56:14,440
In fact, I did, I once introduced her
to this other attorney,

1299
00:56:14,560 --> 00:56:17,680
Greg, who's this...

1300
00:56:17,680 --> 00:56:19,360
...guy who was murdered.

1301
00:56:21,280 --> 00:56:24,680
Anyway, she Just knew
that Karen and I were having problems.

1302
00:56:24,800 --> 00:56:25,800
Were you?

1303
00:56:25,880 --> 00:56:27,600
Yes, you could say that.

1304
00:56:27,720 --> 00:56:29,200
Sexual problems?

1305
00:56:29,240 --> 00:56:31,040
Hey, you know...

1306
00:56:31,120 --> 00:56:33,160
Okay, if you want
to label it, yeah.

1307
00:56:33,200 --> 00:56:35,560
But I'm not saying
it's Karen's fault.

1308
00:56:35,680 --> 00:56:37,720
Was it your fault?

1309
00:56:37,760 --> 00:56:40,680
Maybe it was
Karen's fault.

1310
00:56:40,760 --> 00:56:43,840
Was there sex between
you and this woman?

1311
00:56:45,880 --> 00:56:47,120
Yes.

1312
00:56:48,320 --> 00:56:51,080
You want it now,
lawyer boy?

1313
00:56:51,120 --> 00:56:53,040
- Yes! Yes, please!

1314
00:56:53,040 --> 00:56:53,960
Oh, my God!

1315
00:56:54,040 --> 00:56:55,520
Oh, my God!

1316
00:56:55,640 --> 00:56:56,640
Oh, my God!

1317
00:56:57,880 --> 00:56:59,200
What happened there?

1318
00:56:59,280 --> 00:57:00,560
Wh-why'd we stop?

1319
00:57:01,640 --> 00:57:02,880
What?

1320
00:57:02,920 --> 00:57:05,200
I need to ask you
for a favor.

1321
00:57:05,280 --> 00:57:06,680
Anything at all --
anything!

1322
00:57:06,800 --> 00:57:08,880
Um-hmm, um-hmm.

1323
00:57:08,880 --> 00:57:10,440
I'm gonna need
some legal advice soon.

1324
00:57:10,520 --> 00:57:11,680
You got it!

1325
00:57:11,840 --> 00:57:13,120
You got it.

1326
00:57:13,240 --> 00:57:15,280
You aren't Just saying that?
- You got it.

1327
00:57:15,440 --> 00:57:17,080
You want this?
You like it?

1328
00:57:17,200 --> 00:57:18,440
Can you helpme?

1329
00:57:18,440 --> 00:57:20,440
Anything!
- Say it!

1330
00:57:20,440 --> 00:57:21,880
I will give you
legal advice.

1331
00:57:21,960 --> 00:57:24,440
Say it!
- I will give you legal advice!

1332
00:57:24,560 --> 00:57:26,040
- Say...it!!!

1333
00:57:26,120 --> 00:57:28,200
I'm saying, I will give you
legal advice.

1334
00:57:28,240 --> 00:57:30,680
Yeah?
- Whooah!

1335
00:57:30,800 --> 00:57:32,560
-She whipped you?
- Yes.

1336
00:57:32,720 --> 00:57:34,760
With a whip?
- Yes.

1337
00:57:34,880 --> 00:57:36,120
And you en Joyed it?

1338
00:57:37,960 --> 00:57:39,120
Yes.

1339
00:57:42,360 --> 00:57:44,320
Charlie
I spent so much time

1340
00:57:44,400 --> 00:57:45,640
going by her house,

1341
00:57:45,760 --> 00:57:48,080
ifyou didn't know
my intentions were pure

1342
00:57:48,200 --> 00:57:50,440
you d think I was stalking her

1343
00:57:50,440 --> 00:57:51,880
Hello.

1344
00:57:54,120 --> 00:57:55,560
Hi.

1345
00:57:55,640 --> 00:57:58,400
I looked for any excuse
to go see her

1346
00:57:58,560 --> 00:58:00,200
I spoke to
a friend of mine

1347
00:58:00,240 --> 00:58:02,200
about helping you
with keeping the house.

1348
00:58:02,240 --> 00:58:03,560
Oh, good. Thanks.

1349
00:58:03,600 --> 00:58:05,080
I, uh, I Just

1350
00:58:05,120 --> 00:58:07,240
wish I had known
a bit sooner.

1351
00:58:07,360 --> 00:58:10,440
See, I already sort of contacted
this other lawyer.

1352
00:58:10,520 --> 00:58:12,680
Well, if you'd
rather use him --

1353
00:58:12,800 --> 00:58:15,440
It's Just that I'm not sure if I can
get my retainer back.

1354
00:58:16,640 --> 00:58:17,920
Well, lawyers--

1355
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:20,400
They'll always try to
find a way to screw you.

1356
00:58:20,560 --> 00:58:22,120
Yeah.

1357
00:58:23,200 --> 00:58:25,040
Well, I-I better --

1358
00:58:25,040 --> 00:58:26,440
I, uh --
- Yeah?

1359
00:58:26,520 --> 00:58:29,000
I was making
some supper...

1360
00:58:29,040 --> 00:58:31,120
If you'd like to...

1361
00:58:31,160 --> 00:58:33,080
It's nothing special.

1362
00:58:36,240 --> 00:58:38,000
Surely this was
the hand of God.

1363
00:58:38,080 --> 00:58:40,680
How do you mean, Charlie?

1364
00:58:40,800 --> 00:58:43,640
In an instant I was transformed
from a broken man, made whole.

1365
00:58:43,640 --> 00:58:46,440
It was like Theresa
had been brought back to me

1366
00:58:46,480 --> 00:58:48,440
She even looked like Theresa --

1367
00:58:48,560 --> 00:58:51,160
The way she moved,

1368
00:58:51,240 --> 00:58:52,840
The way she smiled

1369
00:58:54,680 --> 00:58:59,320
# Her skin is like velvet #

1370
00:59:01,680 --> 00:59:06,240
# Her face cut from stone #

1371
00:59:08,280 --> 00:59:12,000
# Her eyes when
she's smiling... #

1372
00:59:12,040 --> 00:59:13,920
Can I helpyou with that?
- No thanks.

1373
00:59:13,960 --> 00:59:16,120
I'll be right back.

1374
00:59:16,200 --> 00:59:18,960
She even made linguini
with tomatoes and onions

1375
00:59:19,040 --> 00:59:20,560
like Theresa used to

1376
00:59:20,640 --> 00:59:22,440
Linguini with
tomatoes and onions.

1377
00:59:22,560 --> 00:59:23,480
Jeez.

1378
00:59:25,680 --> 00:59:27,240
What's that?

1379
00:59:27,320 --> 00:59:28,600
Oh -- Nothing.

1380
00:59:28,680 --> 00:59:31,800
Probably Just a cat
got into the garbage.

1381
00:59:31,880 --> 00:59:33,880
Bread?
- Thanks.

1382
00:59:33,920 --> 00:59:35,680
How come you never
wear a uniform?

1383
00:59:35,800 --> 00:59:37,320
I'm a detective.

1384
00:59:37,440 --> 00:59:39,240
Sometimes I do,
it depends.

1385
00:59:39,320 --> 00:59:42,200
I bet you look
real good in it.

1386
00:59:42,240 --> 00:59:46,120
I couldn't wipe
the goofy smile off my face

1387
00:59:46,160 --> 00:59:49,200
I was so happy

1388
00:59:49,440 --> 00:59:50,840
Because of her
I lost my Job,

1389
00:59:50,920 --> 00:59:52,400
I lost my house,

1390
00:59:52,520 --> 00:59:55,840
I'm an accessory
in not only one, but two murders.

1391
00:59:55,920 --> 00:59:57,040
- Shh!

1392
00:59:57,120 --> 01:00:00,360
Randy:
I couldn't stopthinking about her

1393
01:00:00,480 --> 01:00:02,600
Okay, maybe I wasn t
allowed on the property,

1394
01:00:02,680 --> 01:00:05,200
but that didn't mean I couldn t
keepan eye on her

1395
01:00:12,280 --> 01:00:14,680
And then

1396
01:00:14,800 --> 01:00:17,720
she did something
that sent me over the edge

1397
01:00:19,840 --> 01:00:23,360
I knew I had to
do something

1398
01:00:23,400 --> 01:00:25,280
something drastic
to salvage

1399
01:00:25,440 --> 01:00:27,680
what little I had left

1400
01:00:33,240 --> 01:00:34,840
I got the ten thousand.

1401
01:00:34,920 --> 01:00:36,680
Bingo parlor, right?

1402
01:00:36,680 --> 01:00:38,040
Burmeister:
Yeah.

1403
01:00:38,160 --> 01:00:39,040
The code is,

1404
01:00:39,160 --> 01:00:42,320
I say, "lt looks like we might
get some rain"...

1405
01:00:42,440 --> 01:00:44,040
We came upwith a code.

1406
01:00:44,120 --> 01:00:46,640
I said, "Looks like
we might get some rain"--

1407
01:00:46,720 --> 01:00:48,560
Yeah, yeah,
I know this part.

1408
01:00:48,600 --> 01:00:50,520
Yeah, right.

1409
01:00:50,600 --> 01:00:52,040
You slept with
Randy's girlfriend?!

1410
01:00:52,080 --> 01:00:54,920
I mean, it's not like
I never did anything for him.

1411
01:00:55,040 --> 01:00:57,080
He called and he
needed ten grand,

1412
01:00:57,160 --> 01:00:58,640
so I advised him for free,

1413
01:00:58,680 --> 01:00:59,920
I advised him
how he could borrow

1414
01:01:00,040 --> 01:01:01,600
against that old crappy house
his mom left him.

1415
01:01:01,600 --> 01:01:03,040
You're missing the point.

1416
01:01:03,080 --> 01:01:06,040
How did you feel after you slept
with your cousin's girlfriend?

1417
01:01:06,120 --> 01:01:07,920
He's not even a cousin, really,

1418
01:01:07,960 --> 01:01:10,160
He's my uncle's wife's brother's kid.

1419
01:01:10,240 --> 01:01:13,160
So he's not a blood relative
or anything.

1420
01:01:13,200 --> 01:01:14,920
Did she ever call
and ask for legal advice?

1421
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:17,040
No. No. I keepwaiting.

1422
01:01:17,120 --> 01:01:19,160
It's like she's teasing me.

1423
01:01:19,200 --> 01:01:21,000
I'm dying to give her legal advice.

1424
01:01:21,040 --> 01:01:24,280
I Just seem to be thinking
about her more and more

1425
01:01:24,400 --> 01:01:25,880
Woman:
Excuse me.

1426
01:01:25,920 --> 01:01:28,040
There's a police detective
here to see you about Greg.

1427
01:01:28,160 --> 01:01:29,840
Sure.

1428
01:01:29,920 --> 01:01:31,440
Thanks.

1429
01:01:31,480 --> 01:01:33,040
- Sorry about the mess,

1430
01:01:33,160 --> 01:01:34,600
I'm in the middle
of changing offices.

1431
01:01:34,600 --> 01:01:37,240
How well did you know
Greg Spradling?

1432
01:01:37,360 --> 01:01:39,240
Uh, not that well,

1433
01:01:39,360 --> 01:01:41,880
we worked here for
the last four or five years.

1434
01:01:41,920 --> 01:01:44,160
You were both upfor the same promotion,
weren't you?

1435
01:01:44,240 --> 01:01:45,840
No, not --

1436
01:01:45,840 --> 01:01:47,880
Not really.

1437
01:01:47,920 --> 01:01:49,160
Greg was a good guy --

1438
01:01:49,240 --> 01:01:51,600
No disrespect for the dead --

1439
01:01:51,600 --> 01:01:53,440
Not really partner material.

1440
01:01:53,480 --> 01:01:55,720
So no matter who
I'm talking to,

1441
01:01:55,840 --> 01:01:57,520
she's Just --
she's on my mind.

1442
01:01:57,680 --> 01:01:59,840
Can you think of anything
that might be useful to us

1443
01:01:59,920 --> 01:02:01,040
in our investigation?

1444
01:02:01,080 --> 01:02:05,240
Sounds to me like he
picked upsome rough trade.

1445
01:02:05,360 --> 01:02:08,200
Who knows what happened?

1446
01:02:08,320 --> 01:02:11,640
There could have been...

1447
01:02:11,640 --> 01:02:13,400
...leather.

1448
01:02:13,520 --> 01:02:17,280
There could have been
some bondage...

1449
01:02:17,360 --> 01:02:21,360
Maybe those spiky things...

1450
01:02:21,360 --> 01:02:24,280
Maybe some whipping.

1451
01:02:28,400 --> 01:02:30,440
Could have been pretty kinky.

1452
01:02:32,280 --> 01:02:35,200
But we all know
what that's like, right?

1453
01:02:35,280 --> 01:02:37,560
No sir, I don't.

1454
01:02:38,840 --> 01:02:40,200
That's how much
she messed me up.

1455
01:02:40,280 --> 01:02:42,840
I mean, I'm being
investigated for a murder,

1456
01:02:42,920 --> 01:02:44,640
and all I can
think about is her.

1457
01:02:44,720 --> 01:02:46,680
And the whip?
- Yes.

1458
01:02:46,800 --> 01:02:49,240
There was another reason
I went to see her that day.

1459
01:02:57,880 --> 01:03:00,400
Something had come up
at work

1460
01:03:00,520 --> 01:03:03,440
The shoeprints we found
on Winfield road

1461
01:03:03,480 --> 01:03:05,640
turned out to be
Converse All-Stars,

1462
01:03:05,760 --> 01:03:08,440
the same brand
the boyfriend wore

1463
01:03:08,560 --> 01:03:10,640
And if he was there,

1464
01:03:10,800 --> 01:03:14,120
there was a chance
she might have been

1465
01:03:15,960 --> 01:03:18,760
I had the same sick feeling
in my stomach

1466
01:03:18,840 --> 01:03:20,800
that I had when I was
waiting for The results

1467
01:03:20,840 --> 01:03:23,520
to come back from the lab
at the hospital

1468
01:03:23,560 --> 01:03:27,760
Unfortunately, her print did
match one at the murder site

1469
01:03:27,840 --> 01:03:32,480
That scum,
that boyfriend of hers

1470
01:03:32,600 --> 01:03:34,720
There's no telling
what he forced her to do

1471
01:03:34,840 --> 01:03:37,240
before I came along --
I wasn't going to let her

1472
01:03:37,360 --> 01:03:39,840
get dragged into
a murder investigation

1473
01:03:39,880 --> 01:03:42,720
I knew she had
nothing to do with it

1474
01:03:42,800 --> 01:03:45,400
There's something
I have to ask you.

1475
01:03:45,520 --> 01:03:48,400
Is it an inside question
or an outside question?

1476
01:03:48,520 --> 01:03:51,440
There was a burglary last week
on Winfield Road.

1477
01:03:51,600 --> 01:03:53,400
A man was killed.

1478
01:03:53,520 --> 01:03:54,760
- Was she able
to convince you

1479
01:03:54,840 --> 01:03:57,360
that she didn't have anything
to do with it?

1480
01:04:00,200 --> 01:04:05,760
She was very convincing

1481
01:04:05,840 --> 01:04:07,560
It was a miracle!

1482
01:04:07,680 --> 01:04:09,400
# The way you move #

1483
01:04:09,480 --> 01:04:12,200
# Your sexy body #

1484
01:04:12,320 --> 01:04:15,200
# It makes we want
to get to know you #

1485
01:04:15,280 --> 01:04:17,160
# A little bit better. #

1486
01:04:19,120 --> 01:04:21,040
Sex?!

1487
01:04:22,080 --> 01:04:23,000
Oh --

1488
01:04:26,160 --> 01:04:27,600
There was sex?

1489
01:04:27,640 --> 01:04:31,200
God helpme,
It was wonderful.

1490
01:04:31,280 --> 01:04:33,880
No, for me to helpyou,

1491
01:04:33,960 --> 01:04:36,280
I-I need to
hear everything.

1492
01:04:36,400 --> 01:04:38,640
See, you have to
tell me all about

1493
01:04:38,720 --> 01:04:41,920
the-the-various acts
of physical congress between --

1494
01:04:41,960 --> 01:04:43,760
- I already told you that.

1495
01:04:43,840 --> 01:04:45,640
Okay, no, that's fine,

1496
01:04:45,760 --> 01:04:47,960
I'm not-- it doesn't--

1497
01:04:48,040 --> 01:04:50,080
I shouldn't
have done that.

1498
01:04:50,120 --> 01:04:52,160
It's okay,
I wanted to.

1499
01:04:54,280 --> 01:04:57,160
Are you going to
arrest Randy?

1500
01:04:57,240 --> 01:04:59,840
I've got a warrant
out for him now.

1501
01:04:59,880 --> 01:05:02,240
That car he's driving
is stolen.

1502
01:05:02,280 --> 01:05:04,400
Add a murder charge to that

1503
01:05:04,400 --> 01:05:07,680
and you won't see him for a long time.

1504
01:05:07,680 --> 01:05:11,640
So I'll get to keepthe house.

1505
01:05:14,040 --> 01:05:15,880
This...

1506
01:05:17,200 --> 01:05:19,280
This is all I have left.

1507
01:05:25,640 --> 01:05:28,000
How not perfect
can one woman be?

1508
01:05:28,080 --> 01:05:30,840
Aces in the boink department.

1509
01:05:30,840 --> 01:05:32,960
Got yourself
a snazzy new watch.

1510
01:05:33,080 --> 01:05:35,160
Like this is supposed
to make everything better?

1511
01:05:35,240 --> 01:05:36,760
But you gotta admit,
that's a beaut.

1512
01:05:36,840 --> 01:05:38,800
Here's the money,
Just take it.

1513
01:05:38,880 --> 01:05:41,160
Take it. Take it!
- Shh!

1514
01:05:41,200 --> 01:05:43,320
Kid -- easy, easy.

1515
01:05:43,400 --> 01:05:45,360
Would the owner of
a blue Geo Metro

1516
01:05:45,480 --> 01:05:48,640
Missouri license plates
87KP03 please report

1517
01:05:48,760 --> 01:05:50,200
to the front desk.

1518
01:05:50,320 --> 01:05:52,280
Is that my car?

1519
01:05:52,400 --> 01:05:54,760
You got any idea
what they want?

1520
01:05:54,840 --> 01:05:56,200
No.

1521
01:05:56,240 --> 01:05:58,640
Is there any possibility
that she might have --

1522
01:05:58,640 --> 01:06:00,680
Stolen?
- Yeah.

1523
01:06:00,800 --> 01:06:02,920
Bingo lady:
I want to remind everyone

1524
01:06:03,040 --> 01:06:04,440
that Saturday is "Hawaiian night."

1525
01:06:04,560 --> 01:06:06,640
She gave me a stolen car.

1526
01:06:06,760 --> 01:06:09,840
Women are much more complicated
than we think they are.

1527
01:06:09,960 --> 01:06:11,880
C'mon, let's
get out of here.

1528
01:06:11,960 --> 01:06:14,040
Announcer:
We'll get back to the game

1529
01:06:14,120 --> 01:06:15,840
as soon as the troopers
finish their business.

1530
01:06:15,880 --> 01:06:18,160
Cop:
Sir, is this your car?

1531
01:06:18,240 --> 01:06:19,760
Burmeister:
That piece of shit?

1532
01:06:19,840 --> 01:06:22,200
Officer, what do
I look like?

1533
01:06:24,840 --> 01:06:26,560
You know,
to tell you the truth,

1534
01:06:26,680 --> 01:06:28,800
she doesn't sound worse
than most of 'em.

1535
01:06:28,800 --> 01:06:30,600
- But you'll
do it, right?

1536
01:06:30,600 --> 01:06:32,560
Business is business.

1537
01:06:32,680 --> 01:06:34,640
# A wanted man in Mississippi #

1538
01:06:34,720 --> 01:06:36,320
# A wanted man in old Cheyenne #

1539
01:06:36,400 --> 01:06:39,320
# Wherever you might look tonight #

1540
01:06:39,360 --> 01:06:42,200
# You might see this wanted man ##

1541
01:06:42,280 --> 01:06:43,400
What do you think?

1542
01:06:43,520 --> 01:06:45,920
Oh, what do I think?

1543
01:06:45,960 --> 01:06:48,560
Oh, the flesh is weak...

1544
01:06:48,640 --> 01:06:52,200
But ours is a forgiving God.

1545
01:06:52,280 --> 01:06:54,360
But I destroyed evidence

1546
01:06:54,360 --> 01:06:57,880
I withheld information
for a murder investigation

1547
01:06:57,960 --> 01:06:58,840
- Charlie, look --

1548
01:06:58,880 --> 01:07:01,040
You deserve some happiness.

1549
01:07:01,120 --> 01:07:04,560
The kind of happiness that a...

1550
01:07:04,640 --> 01:07:07,800
...a good woman can bring a man.

1551
01:07:09,640 --> 01:07:10,840
Oh...

1552
01:07:10,880 --> 01:07:12,720
Yes, I have this great Job

1553
01:07:12,800 --> 01:07:14,040
and this great office
and this great family

1554
01:07:14,160 --> 01:07:15,320
and this great house --

1555
01:07:15,400 --> 01:07:16,640
How does this
make you feel?

1556
01:07:16,760 --> 01:07:18,200
Empty.

1557
01:07:18,280 --> 01:07:19,560
I feel nothing.

1558
01:07:19,720 --> 01:07:21,800
And who knows,
it happened so fast.

1559
01:07:21,880 --> 01:07:23,160
I mean, here's this guy
in my office --

1560
01:07:23,160 --> 01:07:24,640
-- what is he,
thirty-five years old --

1561
01:07:24,640 --> 01:07:26,360
and he goes like that.

1562
01:07:26,360 --> 01:07:28,120
I could walk out
of your office

1563
01:07:28,160 --> 01:07:29,600
and get hit by a truck.

1564
01:07:29,640 --> 01:07:31,640
I don't want to live like that anymore.

1565
01:07:31,680 --> 01:07:33,440
Let me Just feel something, anything,

1566
01:07:33,560 --> 01:07:36,280
and then I will look up
and I will say,

1567
01:07:36,400 --> 01:07:40,200
"Thank you, God.
Thank you for that gift."

1568
01:07:40,280 --> 01:07:44,600
And...then if the truck
wants to get me, then okay.

1569
01:07:44,680 --> 01:07:46,760
And then I meet this woman.

1570
01:07:46,840 --> 01:07:50,480
She makes me feel...

1571
01:07:58,640 --> 01:08:00,240
Thank you.

1572
01:08:01,520 --> 01:08:02,840
Oh...

1573
01:08:02,960 --> 01:08:04,200
I'm sorry.

1574
01:08:04,320 --> 01:08:07,040
- Have you acted on your desire
to see this woman again?

1575
01:08:07,160 --> 01:08:09,960
Do you think I should?

1576
01:08:11,880 --> 01:08:13,600
Time's up.

1577
01:08:13,600 --> 01:08:14,760
What?

1578
01:08:14,800 --> 01:08:16,120
Sorry, time's up.

1579
01:08:16,200 --> 01:08:17,880
What, are you kidding me?

1580
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:20,120
Are you Joking?
- Your time's up.

1581
01:08:20,200 --> 01:08:22,440
Do you think I should see her?
Just tell me that!

1582
01:08:23,880 --> 01:08:26,360
# A wanted man in California #

1583
01:08:26,360 --> 01:08:29,200
# A wanted man in Buffalo #

1584
01:08:29,280 --> 01:08:31,200
# A wanted man
in Kansas City... #

1585
01:08:31,240 --> 01:08:33,000
So this is it, huh?

1586
01:08:33,120 --> 01:08:35,400
Could be Boise or Boston.

1587
01:08:35,440 --> 01:08:36,800
Point is, she ain't
anywhere around.

1588
01:08:36,880 --> 01:08:39,000
Check in, you get yourself known.

1589
01:08:39,040 --> 01:08:41,920
Go out, talk to the clerks in stores,
waitresses, the works.

1590
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:43,880
You got a calling card?
- Yeah.

1591
01:08:43,920 --> 01:08:45,960
Make some long distance calls .

1592
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:48,360
Anything to prove you've
been here for a couple of days.

1593
01:08:48,480 --> 01:08:50,640
Awright?
- Gotcha.

1594
01:08:58,200 --> 01:08:59,360
Not so fast, Slick.

1595
01:08:59,360 --> 01:09:00,800
Now I'll take the money.

1596
01:09:00,840 --> 01:09:02,120
Oh, yeah.

1597
01:09:03,560 --> 01:09:06,600
There it is.
Ten thousand dollars.

1598
01:09:08,200 --> 01:09:09,440
You're not gonna count it?

1599
01:09:09,560 --> 01:09:10,840
Nah.

1600
01:09:10,880 --> 01:09:12,160
You trust me?

1601
01:09:12,280 --> 01:09:14,920
No. But I do kill people.

1602
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:16,120
Right.

1603
01:09:16,160 --> 01:09:18,120
I'll be callin' by seven.

1604
01:09:19,120 --> 01:09:20,880
You think I'm a bad person?

1605
01:09:25,920 --> 01:09:27,600
Good afternoon, gentlemen.

1606
01:09:27,720 --> 01:09:29,640
Would you like to
try our new fragrance?

1607
01:09:29,680 --> 01:09:30,360
Good after --

1608
01:09:30,360 --> 01:09:31,720
- No thanks.

1609
01:09:31,800 --> 01:09:33,880
Hi sir. Would you like
to try our new fragrance?

1610
01:09:33,960 --> 01:09:35,200
No thanks.

1611
01:10:14,360 --> 01:10:15,440
Yeah?

1612
01:10:15,560 --> 01:10:17,240
Hey buddy, It's me, Randy.

1613
01:10:17,400 --> 01:10:19,440
- Hey, I was Just talkin'
to somebody about you.

1614
01:10:19,560 --> 01:10:21,360
What, uh, what's up?

1615
01:10:21,360 --> 01:10:23,000
- Not a whole hell of a lot.

1616
01:10:23,120 --> 01:10:24,560
I'm Just here in Collinsville.

1617
01:10:24,600 --> 01:10:26,960
Jewel and I needed a little time
away from each other.

1618
01:10:27,120 --> 01:10:28,640
Oh...

1619
01:10:28,760 --> 01:10:30,800
So, uh, so she didn't go with you?

1620
01:10:30,880 --> 01:10:32,400
- No, man.

1621
01:10:32,480 --> 01:10:35,240
So she's-- She's home,

1622
01:10:35,360 --> 01:10:38,040
she's all by herself now?

1623
01:10:38,080 --> 01:10:41,600
Jewel and I had a little bit of a tiff.

1624
01:10:41,720 --> 01:10:44,800
Good. Spend a coupla days away
and let things cool off.

1625
01:10:44,880 --> 01:10:47,360
And you know what?
Thing's will work out fine.

1626
01:10:47,480 --> 01:10:49,040
Do you really think so?
- Absolutely!

1627
01:10:49,080 --> 01:10:50,920
Okay.

1628
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:52,560
Stay there! Okay.

1629
01:10:55,200 --> 01:10:58,720
TV:
Are you all alone?
Are you heartbroken?

1630
01:10:58,800 --> 01:11:00,800
Did something happen
to the romance?

1631
01:11:00,880 --> 01:11:02,360
Did things get out of hand,

1632
01:11:02,480 --> 01:11:04,920
and now you're afraid
they've gone too far?

1633
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:07,200
Are you about to lose
that someone special forever?

1634
01:11:07,320 --> 01:11:09,440
If you are one of the
97 out of 100 men

1635
01:11:09,560 --> 01:11:12,080
who surveys tell us
suffer deepemotional pains,

1636
01:11:12,160 --> 01:11:13,280
then I am talking to you!

1637
01:11:13,320 --> 01:11:15,240
Don't lose that someone --

1638
01:11:15,360 --> 01:11:17,360

1640
01:11:19,360 --> 01:11:20,840
Don't lose that special someone!

1641
01:11:20,960 --> 01:11:21,960
Pick upthe phone

1642
01:11:22,120 --> 01:11:25,240
and bring the Jewel back into your life!

1643
01:11:25,360 --> 01:11:28,640
Tomorrow may be too late...

1644
01:11:28,680 --> 01:11:30,800
Call EPS now!
Don't waste another minute!

1645
01:11:46,840 --> 01:11:48,160
Man:
Hey! What are you doing!?

1646
01:12:23,840 --> 01:12:25,160
Garbage man:
Hey!

1647
01:12:42,960 --> 01:12:44,120
Come on!

1648
01:12:50,920 --> 01:12:54,880
Carl:
# When love comes
rollin' upyour way #

1649
01:12:55,000 --> 01:12:58,360
# Open up
and let that breeze blow #

1650
01:12:58,360 --> 01:13:01,160
# 'Cause today's
your lucky day #

1651
01:13:18,520 --> 01:13:19,800
No, I don't want
to talk to the kids.

1652
01:13:19,840 --> 01:13:20,960
Can you Just tell them?

1653
01:13:21,080 --> 01:13:22,240
Don't-don't put them on.

1654
01:13:22,360 --> 01:13:25,160
You don't have to --
Hi, Sweetie!

1655
01:13:25,200 --> 01:13:28,600
Um, ah, no.
Daddy's not gonna be home.

1656
01:13:29,920 --> 01:13:31,320
What do you mean?

1657
01:13:31,320 --> 01:13:33,360
Well, how did the dog get out?

1658
01:13:33,360 --> 01:13:34,840
Well, where's his leash?

1659
01:13:50,160 --> 01:13:52,080
Okay, Daddy's gotta --

1660
01:13:52,840 --> 01:13:53,960
Daddy's gotta go.

1661
01:13:54,120 --> 01:13:55,240
- Dad, don't --
Okay, Sweetheart.

1662
01:14:46,840 --> 01:14:47,960
Cosmetic department, please.

1663
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:50,040
Cosmetic department!

1664
01:14:50,080 --> 01:14:51,960
Bye.

1665
01:16:03,160 --> 01:16:05,320
you can't Just
barge into somebody's house!

1666
01:16:05,360 --> 01:16:07,240
Keepyour hands up, Scummo.

1667
01:16:07,280 --> 01:16:08,920
You are in big trouble.

1668
01:16:08,960 --> 01:16:09,920
You need a search warrant.

1669
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:11,120
I happen to be an attorney.

1670
01:16:11,160 --> 01:16:12,120
I Just made partner

1671
01:16:12,160 --> 01:16:14,320
at the second-largest
law firm in the state.

1672
01:16:14,320 --> 01:16:15,800
That's where
I've seen you before.

1673
01:16:15,840 --> 01:16:17,080
You need
a search warrant.

1674
01:16:17,160 --> 01:16:19,000
This is my
girlfriend's house!

1675
01:16:19,080 --> 01:16:21,960
Bullshit! This is
Randy Weltzer's house.

1676
01:16:22,040 --> 01:16:23,440
He happens to be
my cousin.

1677
01:16:23,600 --> 01:16:25,000
He's your cousin?
- Yes.

1678
01:16:25,080 --> 01:16:26,960
And as his attorney,
I can assure you

1679
01:16:27,080 --> 01:16:30,320
that he will be
filing a suit against you

1680
01:16:30,320 --> 01:16:32,360
and the entire
St. Louis Police Department.

1681
01:16:32,480 --> 01:16:34,280
Well, I guess it'll be
right after he stands trial

1682
01:16:34,320 --> 01:16:36,120
for the murder of your former associate
Gregory Spradling.

1683
01:16:36,240 --> 01:16:38,080
Wh-what?!

1684
01:16:38,160 --> 01:16:40,080
Are you crazy?

1685
01:16:40,120 --> 01:16:42,840
Mister, you better take a good long
look in the mirror

1686
01:16:42,960 --> 01:16:44,840
before you call
somebody else crazy.

1687
01:16:44,960 --> 01:16:46,760
Get your clothes on.
I'm takin' you in.

1688
01:16:46,800 --> 01:16:48,360
Okay, um, for what?

1689
01:16:48,360 --> 01:16:49,640
For murder.

1690
01:16:49,760 --> 01:16:52,000
You and Spradling were in competition
for the same position.

1691
01:16:52,080 --> 01:16:54,600
So you and your...

1692
01:16:54,600 --> 01:16:57,440
...gay incestuous lover
killed him.

1693
01:16:57,560 --> 01:16:58,840
What?! No--

1694
01:16:58,960 --> 01:17:00,520
First of all, I am not gay.

1695
01:17:00,600 --> 01:17:02,560
Interesting choice of wardrobe, then.

1696
01:17:02,640 --> 01:17:04,440
I'm married, with two kids.

1697
01:17:04,560 --> 01:17:05,800
Ha ha!

1698
01:17:05,840 --> 01:17:06,960
I'm so not gay,

1699
01:17:07,040 --> 01:17:09,040
I'm here to fuck
my cousin's girlfriend.

1700
01:17:09,080 --> 01:17:10,440
I oughta shoot you
right now.

1701
01:17:10,480 --> 01:17:11,680
He's not really my cousin,

1702
01:17:11,720 --> 01:17:13,400
he's my uncle's wife's
brother's kid.

1703
01:17:13,520 --> 01:17:14,120
That's enough!

1704
01:17:14,200 --> 01:17:15,840
- Come on, hey!

1705
01:17:15,920 --> 01:17:17,440
Freeze!
Freeze!!!

1706
01:17:18,560 --> 01:17:21,080
You're making
a very big mistake.

1707
01:17:21,160 --> 01:17:24,240
You better watch it, buddy,
I am an attorney!

1708
01:17:26,640 --> 01:17:28,160
Get down!

1709
01:17:28,280 --> 01:17:30,640
You're making
a very serious mistake!

1710
01:17:30,760 --> 01:17:32,840
Shut up!
- Ungh!!!

1711
01:17:34,440 --> 01:17:37,160
Un!!! You're
in big trouble!

1712
01:17:37,280 --> 01:17:38,880
Carl:
Okay, here she is.

1713
01:17:38,960 --> 01:17:40,560
She'll clear up
this whole thing.

1714
01:17:40,680 --> 01:17:43,760
What are you
doing here?!

1715
01:17:43,840 --> 01:17:45,400
Uh, Carl...

1716
01:17:45,520 --> 01:17:46,920
What's goin' on?

1717
01:17:48,600 --> 01:17:50,440
It's not what
it looks like.

1718
01:17:50,560 --> 01:17:53,080
Why are you
wearing that?

1719
01:17:53,160 --> 01:17:54,760
Like you don't know.

1720
01:17:54,840 --> 01:17:55,840
Hey, I'm not the one

1721
01:17:55,880 --> 01:17:58,520
who's got him
bent over the table.

1722
01:17:58,600 --> 01:18:00,760
This is official
police business.

1723
01:18:00,840 --> 01:18:02,720
Carl, what are you
doing here?!

1724
01:18:02,760 --> 01:18:03,920
Where is Jewel?

1725
01:18:03,920 --> 01:18:07,280
It was Just that one time
with me and Jewel, I swear.

1726
01:18:07,400 --> 01:18:09,440
What do you mean,
one time?

1727
01:18:09,560 --> 01:18:11,280
You're Iyin'.
She never let you touch her.

1728
01:18:11,400 --> 01:18:14,040
Yeah, not like you,
her "boyfriend."

1729
01:18:14,120 --> 01:18:16,160
Do you believe that?
He calls himself Jewel's boyfriend!

1730
01:18:16,200 --> 01:18:17,200
I'm warning you.

1731
01:18:17,320 --> 01:18:18,320
Where is she?!

1732
01:18:18,360 --> 01:18:20,320
I was expecting her
here any minute!

1733
01:18:20,400 --> 01:18:22,840
Why do you think I'm dressed like this,
for Halloween?

1734
01:18:22,960 --> 01:18:24,760
You're dressed like that
because your perverted cousin --

1735
01:18:24,800 --> 01:18:27,080
Wait a minute.
We gotta find her!

1736
01:18:27,160 --> 01:18:29,360
You are violating a restraining order
and are under arrest!

1737
01:18:29,480 --> 01:18:30,720
You don't understand.

1738
01:18:30,800 --> 01:18:32,760
Someone is coming here
to kill her!

1739
01:18:32,760 --> 01:18:33,560
Him?

1740
01:18:33,560 --> 01:18:35,320
Huh?

1741
01:18:35,440 --> 01:18:36,720
No.

1742
01:18:48,960 --> 01:18:51,120
Which one of you homos

1743
01:18:51,200 --> 01:18:52,840
killed my brother?

1744
01:18:52,960 --> 01:18:54,760
I'm not gay --

1745
01:18:54,840 --> 01:18:56,560
Shut up!

1746
01:18:56,560 --> 01:18:59,320
I understand the man
that killed my brother, Utah,

1747
01:18:59,440 --> 01:19:00,320
he lives here.

1748
01:19:00,320 --> 01:19:02,520
And I'm not leaving
'till I kill him.

1749
01:19:02,520 --> 01:19:04,520
Now, which one of you was it?

1750
01:19:06,280 --> 01:19:07,520
I said, which one of you

1751
01:19:07,520 --> 01:19:08,920
was it!?

1752
01:19:10,360 --> 01:19:12,440
I-I-I'm an attorney.

1753
01:19:12,560 --> 01:19:15,560
I'm sure you and your brother
were very close -- that's good.

1754
01:19:15,720 --> 01:19:18,440
Avenging his death,
wanting to avenge his death,

1755
01:19:18,560 --> 01:19:20,320
that's admirable,
who doesn't understand that?

1756
01:19:20,320 --> 01:19:22,440
But as a lawyer...

1757
01:19:23,600 --> 01:19:25,040
What the hell?

1758
01:19:25,040 --> 01:19:26,560
Jewel:
You want to explain to me

1759
01:19:26,640 --> 01:19:27,880
what you're doing

1760
01:19:27,960 --> 01:19:30,040
looking through
the window of my house?

1761
01:19:30,120 --> 01:19:31,560
Give me your gun.

1762
01:19:33,080 --> 01:19:35,160
I lost my dog, uh --

1763
01:19:35,320 --> 01:19:36,520
he came off his leash.

1764
01:19:50,120 --> 01:19:53,280
And you need
a .357 for that?

1765
01:19:53,320 --> 01:19:56,120
Well, it's
a rough neighborhood...

1766
01:19:56,160 --> 01:19:58,160
... Jewel.

1767
01:19:59,880 --> 01:20:01,560
You should know that.

1768
01:20:04,600 --> 01:20:06,200
Look at these guys.

1769
01:20:06,280 --> 01:20:07,680
Carl:
Legally, you're swimming

1770
01:20:07,760 --> 01:20:09,240
against the current here,

1771
01:20:09,280 --> 01:20:10,880
but you've got
think about the fact

1772
01:20:10,880 --> 01:20:12,680
that if you kill
all three of us,

1773
01:20:12,720 --> 01:20:13,960
you will be adding here,
and I'm Just guessing,

1774
01:20:14,080 --> 01:20:15,560
a second and possibly
third strike

1775
01:20:15,560 --> 01:20:16,920
to your record.

1776
01:20:17,000 --> 01:20:17,920
Which would be
heading you

1777
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:19,600
to some very serious prison time.

1778
01:20:20,440 --> 01:20:23,160
You I'll kill
Just for annoying me.

1779
01:20:23,320 --> 01:20:25,320
Now, I would appreciate

1780
01:20:25,440 --> 01:20:27,680
if the man that
killed my brother Utah

1781
01:20:27,760 --> 01:20:30,160
would stepforward
and take responsibility

1782
01:20:30,320 --> 01:20:31,440
for their actions,

1783
01:20:31,520 --> 01:20:34,240
or I will have
no other choice

1784
01:20:34,280 --> 01:20:37,120
than to kill all you daN...

1785
01:20:37,240 --> 01:20:38,920
...Village People!

1786
01:20:39,040 --> 01:20:41,960
Now...somebody

1787
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:44,320
better damnwell

1788
01:20:44,320 --> 01:20:47,560
start talkin'!

1789
01:20:47,560 --> 01:20:48,560
Aaah!!!!

1790
01:20:48,680 --> 01:20:50,560
Aah!

1791
01:21:27,320 --> 01:21:29,240
Lord, please don't let them
find me in this outfit!

1792
01:21:51,280 --> 01:21:53,320
Aaahh!!!!

1793
01:24:09,640 --> 01:24:12,440
I'm really gonna
miss that little house.

1794
01:24:12,520 --> 01:24:14,480
Yeah, I know
what you mean.

1795
01:24:14,560 --> 01:24:15,680
When I'm on the road
a few days

1796
01:24:15,720 --> 01:24:17,200
I really
miss my place.

1797
01:24:17,280 --> 01:24:19,320
You have a house?

1798
01:24:19,320 --> 01:24:22,080
Oh, yeah --
I'm a real homebody.

1799
01:24:22,200 --> 01:24:25,160
Nothin' I like better than stayin' home
on a quiet night

1800
01:24:25,280 --> 01:24:28,040
watchin' a good movie on my DVD.

1801
01:24:28,080 --> 01:24:30,280
You have a DVD?

1802
01:24:31,720 --> 01:24:34,160
If you're gonna have a first-rate
home entertainment center,

1803
01:24:34,280 --> 01:24:35,800
you gotta have a DVD.

1804
01:24:40,680 --> 01:24:42,960
Not that my place doesn't need
some fixin' up.

1805
01:24:44,880 --> 01:24:47,720
Hell, I was even thinking
about putting in a fountain.

1806
01:24:49,520 --> 01:24:50,880
Yeah.

1807
01:25:04,480 --> 01:25:06,120
Thank you, God!

1808

# Not to mention
how the boys line up#

1824

1830
01:26:04,720 --> 01:26:07,680

see through my hand, #

1831
01:26:07,680 --> 01:26:11,640
# Never was a fool
for my master plan #

1832
01:26:16,720 --> 01:26:19,800
# And though
I grew tired of the games #

1833
01:26:19,920 --> 01:26:24,040
# I would wait around
for my luck to change #

1834
01:26:28,720 --> 01:26:32,640

beat a little faster? #
