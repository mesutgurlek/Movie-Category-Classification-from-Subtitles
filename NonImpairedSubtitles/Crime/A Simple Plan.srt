00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:43,400
I'LL BURN IT,
LISTEN, AND THAT'S IT. HANK...

321
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:45,200
NO. THAT'S THE ONLY WAY
I'LL DO THIS!

322
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:47,100
LOOK, WE GOTTA BE
AGREED ON THIS.

323
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:48,600
THAT'S THE DEAL.
THAT'S THE DEAL.

324
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:51,400
I HOLD ONTO IT, WE WAIT
TILL THEY FIND THE PLANE.

325
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:52,200
IF NOBODY MENTIONS IT,

326
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:53,700
WE SPLIT IT UP,
AND WE MOVE AWAY.

327
00:16:55,100 --> 00:16:56,100
OK?

328
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
I'M IN.

329
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:00,400
WE COUNT IT
FIRST.

330
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:05,100
THAT'S PROBABLY
A GOOD IDEA.

331
00:17:06,700 --> 00:17:08,600
I MEAN, YOU KNOW...

332
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:11,400
HEH HEH HEH...

333
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,300
HEH HEH...
HEH HEH...

334
00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:15,300
THIS IS NUTS.

335
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:16,500
OH, MY GOD...

336
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:19,400
HEY, WHAT YOU GONNA
BUY, JAKEY BOY?

337
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:21,500
I'M GONNA BUY ME
A TRUCK.

338
00:17:22,300 --> 00:17:23,400
NO. FUCK THAT.

339
00:17:23,300 --> 00:17:24,700
GET SOMETHING
CLASSY.

340
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:25,300
TRANS-AM.

341
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:27,900
OH, YEAH, IN MY WILDEST
FUCKIN' DREAMS, A TRANS-AM.

342
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:29,800
YOU COULD BUY A FLEET
OF TRANS-AMS.

343
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:30,700
MARY BETH!
MARY BETH!

344
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:32,200
WHERE THE HELL
HAVE YOU BEEN?

345
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:33,900
WHERE YOU

346
00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:35,800
THERE'S SHOES

349
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:54,800

351
00:17:58,700 --> 00:17:59,800
$4,400,000!

352
00:18:01,900 --> 00:18:03,500
ISN'T THAT GREAT?
LISTEN TO THAT.

353
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:05,990
LOOK AT THAT SHIT, MAN.
LOOK HOW SQUARE IT IS.

354
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,000
THAT IS COOL, HUH?

355
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,300
HOW MUCH IS THAT
APIECE?

356
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:10,800
ABOUT A MILLION
AND A...

357
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:12,200
A MILLION
AND WHAT? SHH!

358
00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:13,400
A MILLION AND
A HALF? WHAT?

359
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:14,800
SHH! YOU
HEAR THAT?

360
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:15,700
UH-UH.

361
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:29,100
OH, SHIT.

362
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:30,800
GET IN THE TRUCK.
I'LL HANDLE THIS.

363
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:32,900
SHIT.
GO ON!

364
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:33,600
Hank: LET'S GO!

365
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:35,000
COME ON, COVER UP
THE MONEY!

366
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,400
JAKE, GET
IN THE TRUCK!

367
00:18:36,300 --> 00:18:37,600
DUMMY UP.
LET'S GO!

368
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,100
COME ON!

369
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:50,900
HEY, CARL.

370
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:52,000
ENGINE TROUBLE,
HANK?

371
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,400
OH, I WISH.
DOG TROUBLE.

372
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:55,990
JACOB'S MUTT CHASED
A FOX INTO THE WOODS.

373
00:18:56,100 --> 00:18:56,500
SHE TREE IT?

374
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:58,800
WE THOUGHT SO, BUT JUST
WHEN WE WENT AFTER IT,

375
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,300
SHE CAME RUNNING BACK.

376
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:01,000
AH.

377
00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:02,600
WHAT'D YOU DO
TO YOUR HEAD THERE?

378
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:04,700
OH. GOD, UH...

379
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:06,500
HEH. RAN INTO
A TREE BRANCH.

380
00:19:08,300 --> 00:19:09,800
YOUR BROTHER
STILL OUT OF WORK?

381
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:12,200
YEAH.

382
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:13,300
LOU?

383
00:19:13,300 --> 00:19:14,400
YEAH, HIM, TOO.

384
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:16,300
THAT'S A SHAME,
AIN'T IT?

385
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:18,400
WELL, WE PROBABLY BETTER
BE HEADING BACK--

386
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:21,900
HEY, HELLO, JACOB!

387
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:24,100
HEY, CARL,
HOW YOU DOIN'?

388
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:25,600
GOOD, GOOD.

389
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:26,700
I WAS BEGINNING
TO THINK

390
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:28,200
YOU WERE TRYING
TO AVOID ME.

391
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:29,100
I'M SORRY?

392
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:30,900
WELL, YOU SITTIN'
OVER THERE IN THAT TRUCK.

393
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:33,100
I THOUGHT YOU WAS
TRYING TO AVOID ME.

394
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:35,000
NO. JUST SITTIN'
IN THE TRUCK.

395
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:36,900
IT'S A LITTLE COLD
OUT HERE, YOU KNOW.

396
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:39,100
JUST KEEPIN' WARM.

397
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:40,700
WELL, WE PROBABLY
BETTER BE--

398
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:42,200
DID YOU TELL HIM
ABOUT THE PLANE?

399
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:44,600
IT SOU-SOUNDED
LIKE A PLANE.

400
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:45,600
WHAT PLANE?

401
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:50,700
WHAT, YOU HEARD
A PLANE?

402
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:52,300
UH...I DON'T KNOW
WHAT HE HEARD.

403
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:54,200
YOU KNOW HE'S ALWAYS
HEARING SHIT.

404
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:55,900
MAYBE YOU BETTER
TELL ME, JACOB.

405
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:57,300
NO, THAT'S OK.

406
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:58,800
WE'RE GONNA
GET ON HOME.

407
00:19:59,200 --> 00:19:59,800
ALL RIGHT.

408
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:00,500
ALL RIGHT.
COME ON, MAN.

409
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:02,200
IT'S NEW YEAR'S!
LET'S GET OUTTA HERE.

410
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:03,800
Jacob:
CALL ME, CARL.

411
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:04,400
HAPPY NEW YEAR.

412
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:06,000
SURE YOU DON'T
NEED ANY HELP?

413
00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:06,900
NO, WE'RE ALL SET.

414
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,200
THANKS.
ALL RIGHT.

415
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:08,600
GODDAMN IT!

416
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:10,800
I'VE SEEN YOU DO SOME
PRETTY STUPID THINGS, JACOB,

417
00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:12,500
BUT THAT PRETTY MUCH
TAKES THE CAKE!

418
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:14,500
IT WAS MY IDEA.

419
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:15,800
OH, WELL, THAT'S
BRILLIANT, LOU.

420
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:17,400
NOW WHEN THEY FIND
THE PLANE,

421
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:18,900
AND THEY REALIZE
THE MONEY'S GONE,

422
00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:20,700
THEY'LL KNOW RIGHT OFF
WHO TOOK IT.

423
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:22,100
WELL, THAT'S--

424
00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:23,600
THAT'S WHAT'S COOL
ABOUT IT, THOUGH.

425
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:25,300
I MEAN, WE WOULDN'T
TELL SOMEBODY

426
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:26,900
IF WE WERE THE ONES
THAT DID IT.

427
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:28,000
IT'S NOT LIKE HE SAID

428
00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:29,700
THAT YOU ACTUALLY SAW
A PLANE GOING DOWN.

429
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:31,500
JUST YOU THOUGHT YOU
MIGHT'VE HEARD ONE

430
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:32,500
WITH ENGINE TROUBLE.

431
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:34,000
YOU WANT ME TO
BURN THE MONEY?!

432
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:35,800
I AM NOT GOING
TO PRISON OVER THIS!

433
00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:37,700
IF IT LOOKS LIKE THERE'S
EVEN THE SLIGHTEST CHANCE

434
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:39,300
OF US GETTING CAUGHT,

435
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:41,000
I SWEAR TO GOD,
IT'S ALL GONNA VANISH!

436
00:20:42,100 --> 00:20:43,200
YOU UNDERSTAND?

437
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:54,000
"IT WAS A PINE APPLE."

438
00:20:54,900 --> 00:20:56,100
HEE HEE HEE HEE HEE...

439
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:09,300
[GROANING] OH, GOD...
THIS IS GONNA BE FUN.

440
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:13,400
Woman: WHERE THE HELL
HAVE YOU BEEN?!

441
00:21:14,300 --> 00:21:15,900
YOU COME WHEN
I'M ALWAYS FINISHED.

442
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,400
I'M FINISHED,
YOU ASSHOLE!

443
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:21,700
HEY, NANCY!

444
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:23,600
DON'T--
DON'T HIT--

445
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:24,900
DON'T HIT
MARY BETH.

446
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:26,500
[LOW] REMEMBER,
NOBODY KNOWS ABOUT THIS.

447
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:27,400
THAT INCLUDES NANCY.

448
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:29,200
SHE'LL HAVE TO FIND OUT
ABOUT IT SOONER OR LATER.

449
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:31,500
SHE'LL WONDER WHERE ALL
THE MONEY'S COMING FROM.

450
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:33,600
2 HOURS LATE!

451
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:34,000
OW! STOP IT!

452
00:21:34,100 --> 00:21:35,800
TELL HER WHEN WE DECIDE
IT'S SAFE TO KEEP IT,

453
00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:37,700
BUT NOT BEFORE THEN.

454
00:21:37,700 --> 00:21:39,100
THEN THE SAME GOES
FOR SARAH.

455
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:41,200
OF COURSE.

456
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:42,200
[THUNK]

457
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:43,000
DAMN IT!

458
00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:43,700
Nancy: COME ON!

459
00:21:43,700 --> 00:21:45,200
YOU PROMISED TO
SHOVEL THE WALK,

460
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:47,100
YOU LAZY SON
OF A BITCH!

461
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:47,900
CALM DOWN, BABY.

462
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,800
I GOT A GOOD REASON
FOR BEING LATE. WHAT?

463
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:51,900
SEE YOU, LOU!

464
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:53,800
[INDISTINCT ARGUING]

465
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:56,100
YOU KNOW, I BET
HE'S TELLING HER.

466
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:59,000
THAT GUY CAN'T
KEEP A SECRET.

467
00:22:12,300 --> 00:22:13,400
HEY, HONEY.

468
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:14,400
HEY.

469
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:16,000
WHERE YOU BEEN?

470
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:24,100
I WAS STARTING TO GET
WORRIED ABOUT YOU.

471
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:25,200
SORRY I'M LATE.

472
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:26,400
OH, THAT'S ALL RIGHT.

473
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:27,400
HEY.

474
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:28,900
WHAT HAPPENED TO YOUR HEAD?

475
00:22:28,900 --> 00:22:30,300
IT'S OK. IT'S
JUST A SCRATCH.

476
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:31,800
IT'S ALL BLOODY.

477
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:34,000
CAN I ASK YOU SOMETHING?

478
00:22:34,300 --> 00:22:35,400
YEAH, SURE.

479
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:38,400
WHAT IF YOU WERE
WALKING IN THE WOODS--

480
00:22:39,300 --> 00:22:40,000
IT'S NOT DEEP.

481
00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:41,600
AND YOU FOUND
A BAG FULL OF MONEY,

482
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,300
LET'S SAY $4 MILLION...

483
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:46,800
WOULD YOU KEEP IT?

484
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:49,500
OF COURSE NOT.

485
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:50,400
HERE, HOLD THAT.

486
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:51,100
HOW COME?

487
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:52,800
WELL, FOR STARTERS,
IT'D BE STEALING.

488
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:55,100
WE WERE TALKING ABOUT
LOST MONEY HERE,

489
00:22:55,700 --> 00:22:57,000
NOBODY'S LOOKING FOR IT.

490
00:23:00,300 --> 00:23:01,700
$4 MILLION
OF LOST MONEY...

491
00:23:02,900 --> 00:23:03,200
YEAH.

492
00:23:03,300 --> 00:23:04,900
THAT NOBODY'S
YEAH. LOOKING FOR?

493
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:08,300
WELL, SO THEN
WHOSE MONEY IS IT?

494
00:23:09,300 --> 00:23:10,300
YOURS.

495
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:11,300
OH.

496
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,000
OOH.

497
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:15,800
IT'S MY MONEY?

498
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:17,300
BUT WHOSE MONEY
WAS IT BEFORE?

499
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:19,600
A BANK ROBBER'S.

500
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:22,300
SO THEN IT'S
THE BANK'S MONEY.

501
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:25,000
ALL RIGHT, IT'S, UH,

502
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:27,000
A DRUG DEALER'S.

503
00:23:28,100 --> 00:23:29,100
IT WAS--

504
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:31,600
HANK.

505
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:33,800
I MEAN, THIS IS
REALLY SILLY.

506
00:23:33,900 --> 00:23:36,600
OBVIOUSLY YOU WANT ME TO SAY
SOMETHING IN PARTICULAR.

507
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:37,400
I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS,

508
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:39,100
BUT YOU WANT ME
TO AGREE WITH YOU

509
00:23:39,100 --> 00:23:40,700
OR SAY THAT YOU'RE RIGHT
OR SOMETHING.

510
00:23:41,100 --> 00:23:42,200
BUT I WOULDN'T TAKE IT.

511
00:23:42,300 --> 00:23:43,700
THAT'S JUST ME. I WOULDN'T.

512
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:00,300
IT'S REAL.

513
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:13,800
IF WE KEEP IT,
WE NEVER HAVE TO WORRY

514
00:24:13,900 --> 00:24:15,100
ABOUT MONEY AGAIN.

515
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:18,200
BUT WE DON'T HAVE TO WORRY
ABOUT MONEY NOW, HANK.

516
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:20,100
YOU'VE GOT A GOOD JOB.

517
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:21,900
WE DON'T NEED IT.

518
00:24:22,700 --> 00:24:26,200
YEAH, BUT NOBODY GETS
HURT BY US KEEPING IT.

519
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:30,900
I MEAN, THAT'S
WHAT MAKES IT A CRIME,

520
00:24:31,100 --> 00:24:32,200
DOESN'T IT?

521
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:33,100
SOMEBODY GETTING HURT?

522
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:34,100
WHAT MAKES IT
A CRIME

523
00:24:34,100 --> 00:24:35,200
IS THAT IT'S
AGAINST THE LAW.

524
00:24:35,300 --> 00:24:36,600
IT DOESN'T MATTER IF
SOMEBODY GETS HURT

525
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:37,400
OR IF THEY DON'T.

526
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:38,900
IF YOU GET CAUGHT,
YOU GO TO JAIL.

527
00:24:39,100 --> 00:24:40,000
NOBODY'S
GONNA GET CAUGHT.

528
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,400
THE MONEY'S THE ONLY EVIDENCE

529
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:42,600
THAT WE'VE DONE ANYTHING WRONG.

530
00:24:42,700 --> 00:24:45,400
WE SIT ON IT,
WE SEE WHAT HAPPENS.

531
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:47,400
IF SOMEBODY COMES
SEARCHING FOR IT,

532
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:49,000
THEN WE JUST BURN IT
AND THAT WILL BE THAT.

533
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:51,200
THERE'S NO RISK.

534
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:52,900
WE'LL ALWAYS BE
IN CONTROL.

535
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:54,900
WHAT ABOUT
JACOB AND LOU?

536
00:24:55,300 --> 00:24:56,700
AS LONG AS WE'RE
HANDLING THE MONEY

537
00:24:56,700 --> 00:24:58,300
THEY HAVE TO LET US
CALL THE SHOTS.

538
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:02,800
IT SEEMS...CRAZY

539
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,200
JUST TO GIVE IT UP.

540
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:07,400

BUT HAPPY NEW YEAR.

545
00:25:26,300 --> 00:25:29,300
YOU HAVE TO GO BACK AND
RETURN SOME OF THE MONEY.

546
00:25:31,300 --> 00:25:32,300
WHAT?

547
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,200
A LOT. LIKE 500,000.

548
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:38,200
YOU SEE, THAT WAY
WHEN THEY FIND THE PLANE

549
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:39,900
THEY'LL ASSUME NOBODY'S
BEEN THERE YET.

550
00:25:40,700 --> 00:25:42,200
IT'LL PUT US BEYOND
SUSPICION.

551
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:44,100
NO ONE WOULD WALK AWAY
FROM THAT MUCH MONEY--

552

GO BACK AND TAKE IT?

WE HAVE TO BE CAREFUL.

799
00:39:10,700 --> 00:39:12,900
NOBODY AROUND HERE KNOWS
ANYTHING ABOUT HER FAMILY.

800
00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:16,600
YOU GUYS COULDA JUST
BOUGHT THE FARM, YOU KNOW,

801
00:39:16,700 --> 00:39:19,100
AND THEN LEFT ME TO RUN IT.

802
00:39:19,700 --> 00:39:20,300
IT'S NOT GONNA WORK.

803
00:39:20,300 --> 00:39:22,000
I THOUGHT THIS WAS
GONNA MAKE YOU HAPPY.

804
00:39:22,300 --> 00:39:23,300
JACOB...

805
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:26,800
FARMING? COME ON.

806
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:30,800
YOU DON'T JUST BUY A FARM.
YOU GOTTA--YOU GOTTA WORK IT.

807
00:39:31,500 --> 00:39:34,200
YOU GOTTA KNOW
ABOUT MACHINERY AND SEED.

808
00:39:35,100 --> 00:39:36,200
I KNOW THAT.

809
00:39:36,500 --> 00:39:37,600
NO, YOU DON'T.

810
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:38,700
FERTILIZERS, PESTICIDES,
HERBICIDES,

811
00:39:38,700 --> 00:39:40,300
DRAINAGE, IRRIGATION,
THE WEATHER?

812
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:42,200
COME ON, YOU DON'T KNOW
ABOUT ANY OF THAT STUFF.

813
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:44,500
YOU'RE GONNA END UP
JUST LIKE DAD.

814
00:39:44,500 --> 00:39:46,900
WHY DO YOU THINK HE
ENDED UP LIKE THAT?

815
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:48,700
I'LL TELL YOU HOW HE
ENDED UP LIKE THAT.

816
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:50,900
HE HAD 2 MORTGAGES RIDING
ON THE PLACE.

817
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:52,800
HE COULDN'T MAKE THE PAYMENTS.

818
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:54,400
WHERE DO YOU THINK
THE MONEY WENT?

819
00:39:54,300 --> 00:39:55,400
HE WAS A BAD BUSINESSMAN.

820
00:39:55,500 --> 00:39:56,600
WHERE DO YOU THINK
THE MONEY WENT?

821
00:39:56,600 --> 00:39:58,300
NO, YOU THINK HE SPENT
IT ALL ON THE FARM?

822
00:39:58,200 --> 00:40:00,950
I'LL TELL YOU EXACTLY
WHERE THE MONEY WENT.

823
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:02,300
4 YEARS OF COLLEGE, BUD.

824
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:05,300
YEAH, DIDN'T YOU EVER THINK
ABOUT HOW HE PAID FOR THAT?

825
00:40:05,900 --> 00:40:07,500
DIDN'T THAT EVER
OCCUR TO YOU?

826
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:08,600
NO, MY TUITION WAS--

827
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:10,200
LISTEN, I'M SUPPOSED
TO GET THE FARM!

828
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:14,100
WHAT DO I GET?!

829
00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:15,600
I'M SUPPOSED
TO GET THE FARM.

830
00:40:17,700 --> 00:40:20,600
YOU GOT--YOU GOT
THE WHOLE WORLD. YOU CAN...

831
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:22,900
I DON'T WANNA HEAR THAT.

832
00:40:28,700 --> 00:40:30,600
YOU CAN GO ANYWHERE
YOU WANT.

833
00:40:34,700 --> 00:40:36,900
THIS IS WHAT I WANT.

834
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:40,800
THIS IS--THIS IS WHERE
I WANNA BE.

835
00:40:41,900 --> 00:40:43,400
IT'S MY HOME, HANK.

836
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:06,000
SHIT.

837
00:41:21,900 --> 00:41:23,000
HEY, HONEY.

838
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:23,500
WHAT?

839
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:25,000
I WANNA SHOW YOU
SOMETHING.

840
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:28,500
WHAT IS IT?

841
00:41:28,600 --> 00:41:29,000
I GOT THIS.

842
00:41:29,100 --> 00:41:30,700
I HAD IT SENT OVER
FROM THE OTHER BRANCH.

843
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:32,600
LOOK. HERE IT IS.

844
00:41:32,900 --> 00:41:34,900
"HEIRESS'S BODY
ID'D BY FEDS."

845
00:41:35,500 --> 00:41:37,500
$4.4 MILLION RANSOM.

846
00:41:37,700 --> 00:41:39,900
YOU SEE? THIS PERSON
NOBODY KNOWS

847
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,200
HAS JUST DISAPPEARED
RIGHT INTO THIN AIR.

848
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:45,300
DO YOU RECOGNIZE ONE
OF THEM FROM THE PLANE?

849
00:41:45,700 --> 00:41:46,800
I CAN'T TELL.

850
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:48,900
HIS FACE WAS...

851
00:41:52,700 --> 00:41:53,700
WHAT?

852
00:41:53,700 --> 00:41:54,600
THIS CHANGES IT.

853
00:41:54,600 --> 00:41:55,700
WHY IS THAT?

854
00:41:57,500 --> 00:42:00,200
WE CAN'T SAY IT ISN'T
STEALING ANYMORE.

855
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:03,000
WELL, HANK, IT'S
ALWAYS BEEN STEALING.

856
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:05,400
WE JUST DIDN'T KNOW WHO
WE WERE STEALING FROM.

857
00:42:05,600 --> 00:42:06,300
WE THOUGHT IT WAS DRUG MONEY.

858
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:08,100
WE THOUGHT IT WAS MONEY
THAT WE COULD FIND--

859
00:42:08,200 --> 00:42:09,100
NO, YOU THOUGHT THAT.

860
00:42:09,100 --> 00:42:10,500
THIS IS GOOD.
I'M GLAD--

861
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:11,600
IT'S GOOD?

862
00:42:11,700 --> 00:42:12,600
YES, IT'S GOOD WE KNOW
WHERE IT'S FROM,

863
00:42:12,700 --> 00:42:13,900
BECAUSE I WAS STARTING
TO GET WORRIED.

864
00:42:13,900 --> 00:42:15,300
I THOUGHT THAT IT MIGHT
BE COUNTERFEIT OR MARKED.

865
00:42:15,300 --> 00:42:16,700
IT MIGHT STILL BE MARKED.

866
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:18,700
NO, IT SAYS RIGHT HERE.

867
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:21,200
LOOK. DENOMINATION
IN UNMARKED BILLS.

868
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:22,500
UNMARKED.

869
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:24,000
YOU SEE?

870
00:42:23,900 --> 00:42:26,400
YOU'RE JUST BEING
PARANOID, HANK.

871
00:42:26,500 --> 00:42:28,700
IT'S OVER. IT'S GOOD.

872
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:31,200
Man: SARAH?

873
00:42:31,300 --> 00:42:32,900
WOULD YOU
COME HERE, PLEASE?

874
00:42:33,300 --> 00:42:34,800
SURE. OK. JUST A SECOND.

875
00:42:35,300 --> 00:42:36,900
I'LL SEE YOU TONIGHT.

876
00:43:03,100 --> 00:43:04,100
[BANGING]

877
00:43:31,700 --> 00:43:32,900
HA HA HA HA HA.

878
00:43:33,400 --> 00:43:33,900
JESUS.

879
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:35,900
HEY, COME ON, HANK.
OPEN UP.

880
00:43:36,900 --> 00:43:39,400
WHAT THE HELL
ARE YOU DOING?

881
00:43:39,700 --> 00:43:40,400
HEY, MR. ACCOUNTANT.

882
00:43:40,500 --> 00:43:42,100
WELL, I'VE COME TO MAKE
A TINY WITHDRAWAL.

883
00:43:42,100 --> 00:43:43,900
GO HOME. TURN AROUND
AND GO HOME RIGHT NOW.

884
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:45,800
OH, COME ON, IT'S
FREEZING OUT HERE, HANK.

885
00:43:45,900 --> 00:43:46,900
SHH! KEEP IT DOWN.

886
00:43:46,900 --> 00:43:48,000
INVITE ME IN.

887
00:43:48,100 --> 00:43:49,500
ALL RIGHT,
JUST FOR A SECOND.

888
00:43:51,600 --> 00:43:53,400
I DON'T HAVE TIME
FOR THIS SHIT.

889
00:43:53,600 --> 00:43:55,100
I GOTTA GET UP
AND GO TO WORK.

890
00:43:56,200 --> 00:43:57,400
I WANT MY SHARE.

891
00:43:57,700 --> 00:43:58,400
WHAT?

892
00:43:58,500 --> 00:44:00,600
I DO. I WANT MY SHARE.

893
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:02,100
I DON'T HAVE THE MONEY HERE,

894
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:04,100
AND EVEN IF I DID,
I WOULDN'T GIVE YOU ANY.

895
00:44:05,600 --> 00:44:06,600
OH, COME ON, NOW.

896
00:44:06,700 --> 00:44:07,900
LOOK, JUST BECAUSE
YOU HAVE IT

897
00:44:07,900 --> 00:44:11,200
DOESN'T MEAN IT'S YOURS.
PART OF THAT IS MY MONEY.

898
00:44:11,800 --> 00:44:14,100
PART OF IT MIGHT BE
YOUR MONEY...

899
00:44:14,300 --> 00:44:15,600
IF WE DECIDE TO KEEP IT.

900
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:17,500
THE PLAN WAS TO SIT
ON THE MONEY

901
00:44:17,800 --> 00:44:19,400
TILL WE DECIDE THAT
IT'S SAFE TO KEEP IT.

902
00:44:19,600 --> 00:44:21,300
WHY ARE YOU COMING OVER HERE
WITH THIS SHIT?

903
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:22,800
ALL RIGHT, LOOK.

904
00:44:22,900 --> 00:44:24,200
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT.

905
00:44:24,100 --> 00:44:25,700
JUST GIVE ME
ONE PACKET, OK?

906
00:44:25,800 --> 00:44:26,800
JUST ONE PACKET.

907
00:44:26,900 --> 00:44:31,200
AND I'LL COME BACK
LATER FOR THE REST.

908
00:44:31,700 --> 00:44:35,600
ASK ME AGAIN, AND I'LL GO
BURN IT TOMORROW MORNING.

909
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:37,600
IS THAT CLEAR?

910
00:44:40,500 --> 00:44:41,500
BLUFF.

911
00:44:41,600 --> 00:44:42,100
WHAT?

912
00:44:42,100 --> 00:44:44,600
IT'S A BLUFF.
B-L-U-F-F.

913
00:44:45,400 --> 00:44:47,600
OH, THEN WHY DON'T YOU
CALL IT THEN

914
00:44:47,900 --> 00:44:49,300
AND JUST SEE WHAT HAPPENS?

915
00:44:50,100 --> 00:44:50,800
YEAH.

916
00:44:50,900 --> 00:44:52,100
ALL RIGHT. OK.

917
00:44:52,100 --> 00:44:53,100
SEE, JACOB TOLD ME

918
00:44:53,200 --> 00:44:55,800
A LITTLE SECRET,
MISTER ACCOUNTANT.

919
00:44:55,900 --> 00:44:59,800
I KNOW WHAT HAPPENED
TO DWIGHT STEPHANSON.

920
00:45:04,100 --> 00:45:05,600
YOU DRANK TOO MUCH.

921
00:45:06,100 --> 00:45:08,100
I WANT ONE
OF THOSE PACKETS.

922
00:45:09,400 --> 00:45:12,200
WELL, I TOLD YOU,
I DON'T HAVE THE MONEY HERE,

923
00:45:12,500 --> 00:45:14,400
AND I HID IT AWAY
FROM THE HOUSE.

924
00:45:14,500 --> 00:45:15,500
MM-HMM. WELL,
YOU KNOW WHAT?

925
00:45:15,700 --> 00:45:16,900
IT'D BE A SHAME
IF SOMEBODY

926
00:45:16,900 --> 00:45:19,600
WAS TO DROP A NOTE
TO CARL JENKINS

927
00:45:19,900 --> 00:45:20,900
SAYING THERE
MIGHT JUST BE

928
00:45:20,900 --> 00:45:22,400
A LITTLE SOMETHING
SUSPICIOUS ABOUT

929
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:24,300
DWIGHT STEPHANSON'S
ACCIDENT.

930
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:26,300
HE JUST DROVE OFF
THAT BRIDGE?

931
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:28,600
DO YOU BELIEVE THAT?
DO YOU?!

932
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:30,100
COME ON. JESUS, LOU.

933
00:45:30,500 --> 00:45:32,600
REMEMBER, YOU'RE A THIEF, TOO.

934
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:34,200
WE'RE ALL IN THIS TOGETHER.

935
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:37,700
IF ONE OF US GOES TO JAIL,
WE ALL DO.

936
00:45:50,500 --> 00:45:51,500
OH, GOD.

937
00:45:54,300 --> 00:45:56,600
I NEED MY SHARE, HANK.

938
00:45:57,200 --> 00:45:58,200
I DO.

939
00:45:59,900 --> 00:46:01,200
I'M BROKE...

940
00:46:02,600 --> 00:46:04,200
AND I OWE PEOPLE MONEY.

941
00:46:04,600 --> 00:46:06,000
CHRIST, LOU,
I MEAN WH-WH...

942
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:10,600
I NEED SOME
HELP HERE, MAN.

943
00:46:12,900 --> 00:46:15,100
OK, JUST WAIT HERE.

944
00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:32,300
HERE, HERE.

945
00:46:34,200 --> 00:46:35,100
$40?

946
00:46:35,500 --> 00:46:36,200
THAT'S ALL I GOT.

947
00:46:36,200 --> 00:46:37,400
MAYBE I CAN GO TO THE BANK

948
00:46:37,500 --> 00:46:40,400
AND GET YOU A LOAN OUT
OF OUR SAVINGS.

949
00:46:40,700 --> 00:46:41,900
LOOK, LOOK, LOOK.

950
00:46:42,200 --> 00:46:43,700
THE MONEY'S A DAY'S DRIVE
FROM HERE.

951
00:46:43,700 --> 00:46:45,400
EVEN IF I WANTED GO GET IT,
I CAN'T GO GET IT,

952
00:46:45,700 --> 00:46:47,600
NOT TILL SARAH
HAS THE BABY.

953
00:46:47,800 --> 00:46:49,000
A DAY'S DRIVE?!

954
00:46:48,900 --> 00:46:49,600
YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT.

955
00:46:49,700 --> 00:46:52,900
I PUT IT IN A STORAGE LOCKER
ABOVE THE INTERSTATE.

956
00:46:53,200 --> 00:46:54,600
WHAT THE HELL IS IT
DOING IN A STORAGE--

957
00:46:54,600 --> 00:46:57,300
SHH! IT'S SAFE.
DON'T WORRY, ALL RIGHT?

TO HIS PLACE,

COME ON,
THAT'S NOT GONNA WORK.

WE SUGGEST WE
GO OUT DRINKING.

YOU DON'T EVER SUGGEST
WE GO OUT DRINKING.

1069

SO YOU WANT ME
TO TRICK HIM?

YOU WANT ME
TO TRICK LOU?

1075
00:52:13,200 --> 00:52:14,600
YOU WANT ME TO
TRICK MY FRIEND?

1076
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:15,300
OK.

00:52:15,400 --> 00:52:17,000
DO YOU GET WHAT'S
HAPPENING HERE?

1078
00:52:17,200 --> 00:52:18,900
DO YOU UNDERSTAND
THE SERIOUSNESS

1079

HE CAN PUT US BOTH
IN JAIL, JACOB.

1081
00:52:21,300 --> 00:52:22,800
HE'S NOT GONNA
SEND US TO JAIL.

1082
00:52:23,200 --> 00:52:24,700
WELL, I CAN'T TAKE
THAT CHANCE,

1083
00:52:25,200 --> 00:52:26,900
NOT NOW,
NOT WITH THE BABY.

1084
00:52:27,800 --> 00:52:30,500
I CAN'T AFFORD TO
GO TO PRISON, JACOB.

1085
00:52:30,900 --> 00:52:32,800
I MEAN, WH-WHAT
ABOUT SARAH, HUH?

1086
00:52:33,500 --> 00:52:35,400
WH-WHAT ARE
THEY GONNA DO?

1087
00:52:37,600 --> 00:52:39,000
I'M GONNA
HAVE TO GET RID

1088
00:52:38,800 --> 00:52:40,100
OF THAT CHRISTMAS TREE
OUT OF HERE.

IT'S TOO DRY. IT'S
GONNA START A FIRE--

00:52:41,600 --> 00:52:43,200
WOULD YOU--WOULD YOU
PAY ATTENTION HERE?

1091
00:52:43,400 --> 00:52:44,600
PAY ATTENTION.

1092
00:52:44,700 --> 00:52:45,900
I'LL THINK ABOUT IT.

1093
00:52:46,300 --> 00:52:46,900
WHAT WOULD DAD DO?

1094
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:47,800
DON'T DO THAT,
PLEASE, HANK.

1095
00:52:47,900 --> 00:52:49,300
DON'T YOU THINK HE'D
WANT US TO STICK TOGETHER?

1096
00:52:49,300 --> 00:52:50,200
DON'T--DON'T SAY THAT.

1097
00:52:50,200 --> 00:52:51,100
I MEAN,
YOU DON'T KNOW

1098
00:52:51,200 --> 00:52:52,100
WHAT THE HELL
DAD WOULD DO.

1099
00:52:52,100 --> 00:52:53,700
THAT'S FUCKED UP.
DON'T BRING HIM UP.

1100
00:53:04,100 --> 00:53:05,100
WELL...

1101
00:53:06,600 --> 00:53:07,900
WHAT IF I WAS TO SAY

1102
00:53:08,200 --> 00:53:09,800
I'D HELP YOU GET
THE FARM BACK, HUH?

1103
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:16,000
ALL RIGHT,

1104
00:53:17,200 --> 00:53:18,900
I'LL HELP YOU
BUY BACK THE FARM.

1105
00:53:21,800 --> 00:53:23,200
BUT YOU GOT
TO HELP ME FIRST.

1106
00:53:31,700 --> 00:53:33,400
YOU KNOW, ALL I MEANT BY
THAT ABOUT THE TREE IS

1107
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:35,000
IT'S JUST DRIED OUT,

1108
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:36,500
AND IT COULD START
A FUCKING FIRE.

1109
00:53:36,900 --> 00:53:38,100
YOU KNOW HOW
THAT STUFF GOES.

1110
00:53:38,200 --> 00:53:39,800
IT WASN'T LIKE I WAS
TRYING TO IGNORE YOU

1111
00:53:39,900 --> 00:53:41,600
OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT.
I WAS JUST, YOU KNOW,

1112
00:53:41,500 --> 00:53:43,900
I WAS TALKING ABOUT
