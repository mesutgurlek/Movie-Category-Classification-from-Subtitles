1
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:06,960
They say she's a real live angel

2
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:13,880
Everyone in there calls her
'Kind-hearted' Geum-ja

3
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:29,040
One, two, three, four!

4
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:36,720
My path is ridden with...

5
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:42,560
high walls and deep pitfalls

6
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:55,800
Who will aid me across
these dark obstacles?

7
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:10,560
The Lord's breathe lifts me
over these walls

8
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:25,040
The Lord's hands bridge my steps
safely over these pitfalls

9
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:32,320
safely over these pitfalls

10
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:41,040
What about the winter clothes
I sent you?

11
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:49,680
It's been hard, hasn't it?
13 and a half years

12
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,560
I'm so proud of you

13
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:58,720
Won-mo and I were playing marbles
here that day, and I lost

14
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:03,200
Won-mo won the biggest marble

15
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:05,600
Then he ran off to go home

16
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:07,520
The investigating authorities...

17
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:10,480
confirmed the details with a woman
who confessed to the crime

18
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:15,360
Lee Geum-ja was first introduced
to the public

19
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:17,800
as the criminal who abducted and killed
Park Won-mo, a little boy...

20
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:20,080
She was nineteen at the time

21
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:25,560
The whole nation was shocked by
her youth, her ruthless methods...

22
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:28,640
and by her unabashed naivete

23
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:29,800
My state of mind...

24
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:32,720
This is where the alleged perpetrator
had confined young Park Won-mo

25
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:35,520
She claims she only wanted to
stop his crying with a pillow...

26
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:39,080
But what shocked us more
were her beautiful looks

27
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:43,760
Clamoring tabloids compared her
to Olivia Hussey...

28
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:48,080
A tactless director announced
plans for a Lee Geum-ja movie...

29
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:50,600
creating a backlash from the press

30
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:55,680
That fall, polka-dot dresses
became the trend

31
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:59,240
I saw you on TV

32
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:01,040
Behind that wicked
witch's face of yours,

33
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:04,760
I saw the presence of an angel

34
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:10,440
An angel...
Could that be true?

35
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:15,240
Do you really think
an angel resides in me?

36
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:18,960
If so, where was that angel...

37
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:21,560
when I was committing
such an evil act?

38
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:26,640
I always wondered about this
after hearing what the preacher said

39
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:29,640
And then, I realized...

40
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:34,720
that the angel inside me only
reveals itself when I invoke it

41
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:39,000
Where are you?
Please, come out

42
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:42,280
I'm right here

43
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:46,800
This act of invoking an angel...

44
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:49,840
This is what we call prayer

45
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:56,200
Actually, prison is an ideal place
to learn to pray

46
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,480
Because...

47
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:09,600
we know that we are
all sinners in here

48
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,400
Thank you

I'm Kim Yang-hee.
I got 5 years

57
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:05,080
They said there was someone
at Kyoungju Women's Prison...

58
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:07,600
...whose face would shine

59
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:09,320
You were a whore, weren't you?

60
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:13,800
I heard her nickname was
'the Witch'

You don't usually wear ties

It's mandatory here

We have lots of VIPs visiting

00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:56,680
Shit, it's too tight.
Loosen it up a bit

65
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:58,600
He was my pimp

66
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:04,040
It felt so good
when I was strangling him

67
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:13,280
- I should've killed myself instead
- Then, die

And be born again.
Over and over if you need to

Prayer is like a scrubbing towel

70
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:27,640
Scrub off all your sins

71
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:33,200
Then your skin will become
as new as a baby's ass. Right?

72
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:38,880
Geum-ja taught me how to
lament my past lives

73
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:52,080
It's a little noisy,
being under the stairs...

74
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:56,120
But this place brings good luck

75
00:09:56,840 --> 00:10:01,680
Look at me. Three years of
giving unlicensed haircuts...

76
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:04,200
And now I have a real shop of my own

77
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:09,680
So set your hopes high

78
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:25,280
These were mine, but
they' II have to do for now

79
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:35,160
You know I wanted to
get you better things, right?

80
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:42,360
Don't you have any high heels?

81
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:52,640
You never really loved me, did you?

82
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:55,680
You were just pretending, right?

83
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:01,440
You've changed a lot

84
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:06,240
You used to be so sweet
and talk so kindly

85
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:10,440
Are you starting the plan already?

86
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:16,200
No. The plan was already started
13 years ago...

87
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:21,400
so Geum-ja murmured to herself

88
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:58,920
Farewell

89

00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:56,760
Please forgive me. Please...

91
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:00,000
She was going to beg
Won-mo's parents

92
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:02,800
until she had no fingers left

93
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:04,360
This is 802/9 Han Apartments...

94
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:07,400
We've had a finger cut off here!

95
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:23,520
Every penny Geum-ja earned
from laboring in prison...

96
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:26,880
had to go to pay for
her finger operation

97
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:28,520
Then 6 days later...

98
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:32,560
For now, just work till noon

99
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:35,720
The dawn hours are tough for me
with my low blood pressure

100
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:42,880
Geun-shik, say hello

101
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,760
I told you about Lee Geum-ja, right?

102
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:47,760
Hello

103
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:55,240
I told you she was pretty

104
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:01,880
Can I call you elder sister?

105
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:07,440
Just call me Geum-ja

106
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:10,240
Lee Geum-ja...

107
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:15,880
When she first came, she cried
non-stop, like a newborn baby

108
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:18,960
Man, it was so depressing

109
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:22,120
Damn bitch!

110
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:29,680
It brings bad luck.
Stop crying!

111
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:41,120
As a man once taught her,

112
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:43,600
whenever she was having
a hard time...

113
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:45,040
lapse on the floor like this

114
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:47,320
She'd bend over and
take five deep breaths

117
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:00,760
Down on the floor and
keep your damn hands up!

118
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:20,880
I felt like I was dying because
I couldn't be with my love...

119
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:25,480
Turned out I was suffering from
chronic kidney failure

120
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:29,240
But it felt like I was dying anyway

121
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:35,480
Then this bitch suddenly says
she' II give me one of her kidneys

122
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,160
It's not as if a kidney's
a bit of fluff

123
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:44,600
you give away so easily

124
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:46,240

I'm married to a goddess

00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:26,760

I was never afraid

132
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:29,280
Right, honey?

133
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:34,000
Yeah, but we couldn't go in together

134
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:37,160

not jail

<i>Ko Sun-sook

147
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:04,560
A spy from North Korea,
Ko Sun-sook had Alzheimer's...

148

...and was a problem for the prison

149
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:10,760
So when Geum-ja volunteered
to look after her...

150
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:13,440
Even the prison warden was relieved

They were stepping around me
whispering, 'The woman spy is dead'

But the pride in my heart...

wouldn't let me die

00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:39,920
What were you thinking?

161
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:44,160
I don't want every Tom
Dick and Harry dropping by

162
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:48,360
Fine. I' II see you tomorrow

163
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:59,240
How could you have changed
so much?

164
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:02,120
This isn't like you!

165
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:06,120
Could we start over again?

166
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:12,640
Come to church. Please?

167
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:21,360
I've converted to Buddhism!

168
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:24,040
I bet you're in for adultery

169
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:27,520
- How did you know?
- It's all over your face, bitch!

170
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:38,440
Please crawl over here

171
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:56,680
Please take them off

172
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:03,200
<i>Oh Soo-hee
Time served 1993 ~ 1994</i>

173
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:29,760
Can you see it well?

174
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:37,520
Say hello to each other

175
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:40,080
Hello

176
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:44,320
Soo-hee Hello?

177
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:49,960
This damn bitch
is that infamous "Witch"

178
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:56,600
She killed her husband and
his mistress, then ate them

179
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:58,600
So...

180
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:01,600
I guess I'm not the unluckiest

181
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:04,560
I' II suck on her for five minutes
and cry it off

182
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:20,960
I hate them skinny bitches

183
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:26,120
So go tell Geum-ja to start eating
some more, okay?

184
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:31,720
Your style has changed

185
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:38,000
What's with the blood-red eye shadow?

186
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:42,200
People are always saying
I look kind-hearted

187
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:56,760
People order them from me,
modelled on their guys' photos

188
00:24:58,160 --> 00:25:01,760
They're very popular.
Want me to make you one?

189
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:07,040
Can you make it in silver?

190
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:20,160
Did you find that bastard yet?

191
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:21,680
I did

192
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:24,200
Did you kill him?

193
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:25,800
Not yet

194
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:28,040
Why not?

195
00:25:28,840 --> 00:25:30,320
I've been busy

196
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:38,000
'Saving the best for last, '
is that it?

197
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:45,120
Yes

198
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:49,600
- I' II take this one
- Excellent choice

199
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:56,400
Is it true the owner
studied confection in Japan?

200
00:25:57,800 --> 00:26:00,040
The lady made this one

201
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:08,680
You've changed so much,
I hardly recognized you

202
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:16,960
- Who was she?
- Who was he?

203
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:18,760
She's pretty

204
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:21,640
The detective that was
in charge of my case

205
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,760
When I was exactly your age...

206
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:32,000
That is, when I was nineteen,
and you were five...

207
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:38,240
I... Kidnapped and killed
a five year-old boy

208
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:39,960
My goodness!

209
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:43,600
Don't worry.
I didn't eat him up

210
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:45,040
We can't eat this!

211
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:47,640
It was made by hands
that have killed!

212
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:51,400
I'm telling you I killed him

213
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:55,960
How many times
do I have to tell you?

214
00:26:56,880 --> 00:27:01,240
Then tell me what
that marble looked like

215
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:03,640
What?

216
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:07,960
That marble you said you saw

217
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:10,640
but didn't know where it went...

218
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:15,080
It was Won-mo's favorite marble

219
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:17,960
What color was it?

220
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:32,520
Light green

221
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:38,840
Come on! Why would anyone confess

222
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:41,840
to a murder they didn't commit?

223
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:44,520
Why won't you believe me?

224
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:47,000
Is it because I'm a murderer?

225
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:15,880
- Believe in Jesus, go to heaven
- Believe in Jesus, go to heaven

226
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,600
- Without faith, there's only hell
- Without faith, there's only hell

227
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:20,480
Devil, begone!

228
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:19,480
On top of that, I killed again
in prison

229
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:35,200
Geum-ja wondered if Geun-shik
wasn't a fool

230
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:47,560
I understand what you're saying...

231
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:50,840
But it's against regulations
to give out that information

232
00:30:51,560 --> 00:30:54,760
There is a counseling
service I can refer you to...

233
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:57,560
Could you at least tell me
whether she was adopted or not?

234
00:30:58,560 --> 00:31:00,360
Didn't you receive the notice?

235
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:04,560
I was in jail, you see

236
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:11,640
I'd like to show you
the 18-year-old Lee Geum-ja...

237
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:15,200
A pretty girl who would turn
any head...

238
00:31:15,320 --> 00:31:19,520
But who wasn't
the least bit particular

239
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:25,480
But this poor girl
was on the verge of going mad

240
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:31,400
She tried to comfort herself...

241
00:31:31,560 --> 00:31:36,520
with the thought that it happens
to every woman sooner or later

242
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:41,600
Teacher? Mr. Baek?
This is Geum-ja, Lee Geum-ja

243
00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:47,600
I used to polish your shoes when
you were our student teacher last year

244
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:49,240
You didn't know it was me?

245
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:53,760
You told me I was sexy

246
00:31:56,400 --> 00:32:00,160
Yes. You remember me, right?
Pardon?

247
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:03,920
Well, it's nothing much...

248
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:06,240
You see, teacher, I'm pregnant
Pregnant

249
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:08,640
Pregnant

250
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:10,640
No, pregnant!

251
00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:13,320
Yes, I am

252
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:16,280
Could I go live with you?

253
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:19,840
Please?

254
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:24,040
I can't go to my mom's

255
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:27,400
and it's even worse
at my dad's

256
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:33,560
Him? He's just a big kid,
not ready for fatherhood

257
00:32:36,280 --> 00:32:39,800
Don't worry, baby.
Your mama's right here

258
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:47,160
The poor girl murmured to herself

259
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:32,840
There's a drug called 'Timing. '
It suppresses sleep

260
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:39,080
When I was just back from Tokyo,
managing a confectionery factory...

261
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:45,120
And we had a lot of work, I used to
take it first, in front of the staff

262
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:47,240
They all hated me

263
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:50,480
You have to be careful when
riding a bike after taking it though

264
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:55,640
Hello

265
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:06,000
- Have you eaten?
- Yes, ma'am

266
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:15,880
Geum-ja, what brings you here
at this hour?

267
00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:18,400
I need an advance

268
00:34:22,520 --> 00:34:23,920
No advances

269
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:29,120
I went to Kyoungju,
where my parents lived...

270
00:34:29,920 --> 00:34:32,560
I volunteered to teach
at the women's prison there...

271
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:38,520
Because my folks worried I couldn't
get married with my lame leg

272
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:47,840
But in my third year there,
I was shocked almost to death...

273
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:52,640
...after tasting a strawberry mousse
made by a kidnapper

274
00:34:53,640 --> 00:34:57,200
The ingredients given to the
inmates were miserable...

275
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:02,880
But she'd used them to create
a cake fit for a king

276
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:04,600
Three months' advance

277
00:35:11,080 --> 00:35:12,760
You know, you've changed?

278
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:18,440
In the end, I packed up
and moved to Seoul

279
00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:21,120
Because I was motivated to
open up my own bakery

280
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:23,800
What are you doing?

281
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:26,640
Writing my account number

282
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:43,640
I want to start a family young...

283
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:50,280
And hope to marry
someone I can respect

284
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:06,920
So, you did something wrong...

285
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:10,680
You make penance and promise

286
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:14,720
never to do it again, right?

287
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:17,960
That's just how life goes.
That's life!

288
00:36:18,120 --> 00:36:20,560
It's just another experience gained

289
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:23,080
Isn't that right, Geum-ja?

290
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:27,480
I'm planning to kill another person

291
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:29,000
What?

292
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:33,960
Do you think I'm sexy?

293
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:36,080
Yes... No

294
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:38,760
Well... Yes

295
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:54,040
I was hoping we could talk some more

296
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:05,240
Maybe later?

297
00:37:09,320 --> 00:37:11,480
You're trying to scare me,
aren't you?

298
00:37:14,120 --> 00:37:16,280
You're trying to put me off?

299
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:23,000
Does it put you off
when a girl does this?

300
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:25,200
No

301
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:30,600
Please go ahead

302
00:38:06,840 --> 00:38:13,240
It was alright for me.
Was it good for you?

303
00:38:16,080 --> 00:38:17,560
I've been told it was so-so

304
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:22,840
No way

305
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:27,560
Mr. Baek said there
are good kidnappings

306
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:29,760
and bad kidnappings

307
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:31,200
What?

308
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:35,800
He said it was a good kidnapping
if the child is returned safely

309
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:40,760
And since they're rich, a little
ransom wouldn't make much difference...

310
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:43,720
And although they'd have to worry
a few days...

311
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:45,960
The emotional reunion would
make the family bond more closely

312
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:49,400
That's what he said, but then he went
and killed Won-mo

313
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:51,520
The boy kept crying...

314
00:38:51,640 --> 00:38:54,760
And Mr. Baek said he'd kill him
if he didn't stop in 5 minutes

315
00:38:55,120 --> 00:38:56,880
But then he really did kill him

316
00:38:57,800 --> 00:39:01,800
If he were alive, he'd be
your age now, but he's dead

317
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:05,520
Then the police found a witness

318
00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:08,880
Someone saw me taking Won-mo
to a bath-house

319
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:13,840
Then one day, when I came back from
the market, my daughter was gone

320
00:39:21,080 --> 00:39:23,440
I got a call from Mr. Baek

321
00:39:23,960 --> 00:39:26,240
He said to confess
and take all the blame

322
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:28,360
or my girl would die, too

323
00:39:29,840 --> 00:39:34,080
So the kidnapper had kidnapped
a kidnapper's kid

324
00:39:35,480 --> 00:39:36,960
Isn't that funny?

325
00:39:39,240 --> 00:39:40,840
I thought it was

326
00:39:45,640 --> 00:39:48,200
The house key is the middle one

327
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:51,840
Make sure these candles don't go out

328
00:39:56,880 --> 00:39:59,720
Touch anything else and
I' II give you a hole in the head

329
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:05,160
Going somewhere?

330
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:56,000
Hello. I'm Lee Geum-ja,
from Korea

331
00:40:56,400 --> 00:41:00,680
I had a baby thirteen years ago

332
00:41:01,320 --> 00:41:04,520
I think it's your daughter now

333
00:41:05,240 --> 00:41:10,880
I came here only to see her
once and for all

334
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:26,000
I need to smoke

335
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:42,040
once and for all

336
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:48,680
I'm Lee Geum-ja

337
00:41:49,360 --> 00:41:54,600
- I'm Lee Geum... I had a baby...
- Oh, I'm so jealous of you

338
00:41:55,960 --> 00:41:59,480
You had such a beautiful daughter

339
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:04,560
She is now our life

340
00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:21,720
We love her very much

341
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:25,760
She's got such a beautiful soul

342
00:42:26,160 --> 00:42:29,880
What would we do without our Jenny

343
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:39,400
What do you, call, 'mom' in Korea?

344
00:42:44,320 --> 00:42:49,640
What, is, 'mom', in Korean?

345
00:42:51,520 --> 00:42:53,760
Geum-ja

346
00:43:09,360 --> 00:43:12,640
Can you take me to Seoul,
Geum-ja?

347
00:43:13,840 --> 00:43:15,640
- No!
- Yes...

348
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:18,160
- Your mother, your father... no!
- Why? Please...

349
00:43:18,280 --> 00:43:20,240
- No!
- Come on. Why not?

350
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:21,200
- No!
- Yes

351
00:43:21,360 --> 00:43:22,160
- No!
- Yes!

352
00:43:22,320 --> 00:43:23,600
- No. No!
- Why?

353
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:24,680
- No!
- Yes!

354
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:26,560
- No!
- No, Come on

355
00:43:26,680 --> 00:43:28,360
- No!
- Seoul, Korea!

356
00:43:38,960 --> 00:43:45,000
Geum... Geum-ja...

357
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,640
Geum... ja

358
00:43:49,520 --> 00:43:52,960
Geum... Geum-ja...

359
00:43:54,440 --> 00:43:58,880
It' II sound like a cannon,
with lots of smoke, too

360
00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:01,560
The design's so primitive

361
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:05,200
What's the use of all this fanciness?
Better to have a strong solid shot

362
00:44:05,360 --> 00:44:08,840
It has to be pretty.
Everything should be pretty

363
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:14,240
It has a very short range.
So get up close when you shoot

364
00:44:15,120 --> 00:44:18,440
If you can hear his heart beating...

365
00:44:18,560 --> 00:44:21,720
And see the sweat on his forehead,
even better

366
00:44:23,680 --> 00:44:29,000
It's like playing golf.
You get good hits with good form

367
00:44:29,600 --> 00:44:31,400
Got a place to practice?

368
00:44:43,920 --> 00:44:45,480
Why'd you dump me?

369
00:44:57,720 --> 00:45:02,000
Tomorrow,
let's go on a picnic, okay?

370
00:45:19,280 --> 00:45:21,000
Why'd you dump me?

371
00:45:23,320 --> 00:45:25,600
That's right. A picnic...

372
00:45:29,960 --> 00:45:34,760
I mean why? Why?

373
00:45:59,760 --> 00:46:02,320
Do you speak English?

374
00:46:07,240 --> 00:46:08,520
Damn...

375
00:46:08,680 --> 00:46:11,880
For the longest time, Geum-ja
has wanted to meet with Won-mo...

376
00:46:12,040 --> 00:46:16,120
And ask for his forgiveness

377
00:46:16,840 --> 00:46:20,720
She'd be very unhappy if she found

378
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:24,280
out he appeared before Jenny

379
00:46:51,440 --> 00:46:55,560
Weekends with the family,
and the dog... Right?

380
00:48:38,800 --> 00:48:40,080
Oppa! (Elder brother)

381
00:48:41,560 --> 00:48:42,760
Oppa!

382
00:48:55,360 --> 00:48:58,680
Appa! (Dad)

383
00:48:59,760 --> 00:49:00,800
- Jenny
- Stupid

384
00:49:16,560 --> 00:49:18,520
How are you this morning?

385
00:49:18,640 --> 00:49:24,840
Very well thank you.
Run away, run away

386
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:27,240
Where is mother...

387
00:50:42,680 --> 00:50:43,680
Honey...

388
00:50:44,120 --> 00:50:45,240
Honey...

389
00:50:47,400 --> 00:50:51,560
I'm meeting with friends
later today

390
00:50:53,200 --> 00:50:56,520
I' II have your dinner ready
before I leave

391
00:50:58,600 --> 00:50:59,880
Would you mind?

392
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:04,880
Don't you be the one to pay for dinner

393
00:51:05,040 --> 00:51:05,960
Right...

394
00:51:06,080 --> 00:51:10,560
<i>Park Yi-jeong
Time served 1993 ~ 1999</i>

395
00:52:14,640 --> 00:52:17,200
Hey, harlot

396
00:52:17,640 --> 00:52:19,880
You parasite, living off of men's blood

397
00:52:23,120 --> 00:52:25,840
I've got just the job
for a slut like you

398
00:52:46,960 --> 00:52:49,920
You know how itchy it is when
you get bit on the sole of your foot?

399
00:52:51,880 --> 00:52:53,360
What did I tell you?

400
00:52:53,520 --> 00:52:55,880
What did I say!

401
00:52:56,560 --> 00:52:58,440
It tickles when you scratch...

402
00:52:58,600 --> 00:53:01,600
and it itches when you don't scratch

403
00:53:01,720 --> 00:53:04,960
Itches if you don't scratch, and
tickles when you do. Right?

404
00:53:05,080 --> 00:53:10,240
You slut! Itches if you don't scratch,
and tickles when you do...

405
00:53:33,960 --> 00:53:36,320
I used to have a strong stomach

406
00:53:38,560 --> 00:53:40,720
I don't know what the problem is...

407
00:53:51,520 --> 00:53:55,320
Sorry. Nasty, huh?

408
00:53:56,320 --> 00:53:59,440
That's quite alright.
I enjoy helping you

409
00:54:01,800 --> 00:54:06,800
Thanks, Geum-ja.
You really are kind-hearted

410
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:15,720
You understand that I only like
plump girls, right?

411
00:54:17,800 --> 00:54:23,120
Of course. I' II eat a lot, too,
and plump up for you

412
00:54:23,440 --> 00:54:30,040
So, you just keep taking lots
of food and medicine...

413
00:54:35,920 --> 00:54:37,200
And hurry up and die

414
00:54:37,640 --> 00:54:40,840
- She fed her bleach?
- Really?

415
00:54:41,280 --> 00:54:43,720
- For how long?
- Three years

416
00:54:44,080 --> 00:54:48,320
What a clean stomach she must've had

417
00:54:48,480 --> 00:54:54,120
- Geum-ja the Kind-hearted
- Well done, her!

418
00:54:54,240 --> 00:54:58,320
After that, Geum-ja inherited
the 'Witch' nickname...

419
00:54:58,480 --> 00:55:01,120
But was also still referred to
as 'Kind-hearted Geum-ja'

420
00:55:01,920 --> 00:55:05,160
Everyone wanted to help
Kindhearted Geum-ja...

421
00:55:05,280 --> 00:55:09,120
And no one could refuse the Witch
any favors

422
00:55:09,280 --> 00:55:10,680
It has to be tonight

423
00:55:10,800 --> 00:55:13,560
I can't take it any more.
Not even for you

424
00:55:14,560 --> 00:55:19,240
Soo-kyoung, a thief released before me,
found out where Baek was working

425
00:55:19,640 --> 00:55:23,040
Seong-eun, a smart college grad
was later released

426
00:55:23,200 --> 00:55:25,000
and got a job at the same place

427
00:55:25,480 --> 00:55:29,280
She then informed me of Baek's
intention of getting a new car

428
00:55:29,440 --> 00:55:34,000
Later, Baek was visited by a
pretty car dealer, Park Yi-jeong

429
00:56:21,320 --> 00:56:24,040
It'll be used wisely
for the Lord's work

430
00:56:34,280 --> 00:56:35,480
Hello?

431
00:56:36,960 --> 00:56:38,080
Darling

432
00:56:39,640 --> 00:56:41,440
Have you had dinner?

433
00:56:42,320 --> 00:56:44,480
I' II wait and have it with you

434
00:56:45,360 --> 00:56:47,160
You can go ahead without me

435
00:56:49,960 --> 00:56:51,680
I' II wait for you,

436
00:56:53,440 --> 00:56:54,760
so hurry back

437
00:56:57,360 --> 00:57:01,000
He hasn't eaten yet

438
00:57:01,120 --> 00:57:03,480
I' II go and make him eat first

439
00:57:03,600 --> 00:57:04,840
It's okay. Don't worry

440
00:57:15,440 --> 00:57:16,520
Bye

441
00:57:17,600 --> 00:57:19,080
Geum-ja

442
00:58:52,720 --> 00:58:58,080
At that moment, Geum-ja held her
breath and struggled to break free

443
01:00:20,200 --> 01:00:22,480
Even in this desperate situation,

444
01:00:22,600 --> 01:00:27,200
she never forgot
the gun's firing range

445
01:03:03,840 --> 01:03:05,520
Got an English-Korean dictionary?

446
01:03:09,640 --> 01:03:12,320
Don't think that I' II forgive you

447
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:17,480
I think all moms who
desert their kids belong in jail

448
01:03:19,360 --> 01:03:23,840
When I was younger, I often
thought of taking revenge out on you

449
01:03:24,840 --> 01:03:28,920
But I couldn't imagine
the thought of killing you

450
01:03:29,800 --> 01:03:33,240
Reason being that, I didn't know
what your face looked like

451
01:03:34,120 --> 01:03:36,200
Anyway, since we're
on better terms now,

452
01:03:36,320 --> 01:03:40,800
give me your reasons at least

453
01:03:40,920 --> 01:03:43,680
A simple 'sorry' won't do

454
01:03:43,800 --> 01:03:47,200
You have to say it at least 3 times

455
01:03:48,520 --> 01:03:51,360
Your not so generous daughter,
Jenny

456
01:04:05,200 --> 01:04:06,440
Left turn

457
01:04:42,160 --> 01:04:44,760
I remember when I first had you, Jenny

458
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:54,560
As you grew in me, I felt like
my wallet was getting fatter

459
01:05:02,360 --> 01:05:04,920
But even before your first birthday,

460
01:05:05,040 --> 01:05:10,480
I had to go to jail...
And I had to give you up

461
01:05:20,080 --> 01:05:23,520
You were such a sweet child that would
smile at even complete strangers...

462
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:35,880
I knew that any family
would have to fall in love with you

463
01:05:42,840 --> 01:05:46,360
Once I'm done with this man...

464
01:05:46,480 --> 01:05:49,480
I'm planning to return you to Australia

465
01:06:00,960 --> 01:06:04,480
My sins are too big and deep...

466
01:06:05,080 --> 01:06:08,600
I don't deserve to have
a sweet daughter like you

467
01:06:19,200 --> 01:06:26,600
You're innocent, but you had to
grow up without a mother...

468
01:06:39,240 --> 01:06:44,760
But, that's also part of
the punishment I must take

469
01:06:52,520 --> 01:06:53,960
Listen carefully

470
01:06:56,840 --> 01:06:59,720
Everyone makes mistakes

471
01:07:02,440 --> 01:07:05,480
But if you sin, you have to
make atonement for it

472
01:07:10,200 --> 01:07:11,800
Atonement, understand?

473
01:07:14,720 --> 01:07:16,120
Atonement

474
01:07:17,200 --> 01:07:20,240
That's right, you have to
make atonement

475
01:07:22,280 --> 01:07:24,320
Big atonement for big sins...

476
01:07:26,400 --> 01:07:28,480
Small atonement for small sins

477
01:07:31,120 --> 01:07:32,320
You got it?

478
01:07:34,360 --> 01:07:36,640
What are you going to do
with him?

479
01:07:39,080 --> 01:07:40,200
Kill him?

480
01:07:43,280 --> 01:07:44,320
Why?

481
01:07:48,560 --> 01:07:51,720
Because he made a sinner out of me

482
01:07:57,080 --> 01:07:58,960
What is your sin?

483
01:08:02,560 --> 01:08:05,680
This man kidnapped and killed
a little boy...

484
01:08:08,680 --> 01:08:12,680
And...
I helped him

485
01:08:21,760 --> 01:08:24,520
Do you want me to go and
apology his mother?

486
01:08:50,120 --> 01:08:53,840
Will you? Were you happy with me?

487
01:08:53,960 --> 01:08:55,200
I was happy...

488
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:00,920
Too happy for a sinner

489
01:09:08,840 --> 01:09:09,920
Jenny...

490
01:09:14,280 --> 01:09:15,880
I'm sorry

491
01:09:17,560 --> 01:09:18,880
I'm sorry

492
01:09:20,840 --> 01:09:22,320
I'm sorry

493
01:09:24,960 --> 01:09:28,680
I'm truly sorry

494
01:09:45,080 --> 01:09:46,480
Good bye

495
01:10:25,760 --> 01:10:31,000
Get up, teacher!
Time to go to work!

496
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:37,200
Get up, teacher!
Time to go to work!

497
01:10:38,200 --> 01:10:39,520
Get up...

498
01:11:49,080 --> 01:11:54,880
Geum-ja, what's with
that eye shadow?

499
01:13:28,320 --> 01:13:29,920
Do you know why those kids...

500
01:14:03,240 --> 01:14:05,040
Hey! Here's another one!

501
01:14:10,360 --> 01:14:11,560
Hello?

502
01:14:19,360 --> 01:14:20,640
If you'd found
the real killer back then

503
01:14:20,760 --> 01:14:22,560
These children wouldn't have died,

504
01:14:23,680 --> 01:14:25,240
right?

505
01:14:27,400 --> 01:14:29,080
You know how this feels

506
01:14:33,840 --> 01:14:35,240
There were four!

507
01:14:48,440 --> 01:14:50,560
I told you I can't come
to work today

508
01:14:50,720 --> 01:14:52,000
It's not that...

509
01:14:53,680 --> 01:14:56,440
- Someone's here looking For you
- Who?

510
01:14:57,320 --> 01:15:00,360
- Well, the thing is...
- They won't say Who They are?

511
01:15:00,480 --> 01:15:02,280
I don't know what they're saying

512
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:13,400
Can you speak Japanese?

513
01:15:21,120 --> 01:15:23,200
Mommy!

514
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:28,720
Please hurry and come get me...

515
01:17:08,160 --> 01:17:10,400
Mommy... please hurry

516
01:17:11,600 --> 01:17:16,920
Mommy, I wanna go home.
Please hurry, mommy

517
01:17:17,760 --> 01:17:19,720
There, there. Don't cry.
Don't cry...

518
01:17:21,600 --> 01:17:23,160
Mommy, where are you?

519
01:17:30,400 --> 01:17:35,920
I know it's difficult but
take a good look at this man

520
01:17:37,760 --> 01:17:41,680
Next is Se-hyun, killed in 1995

521
01:17:54,960 --> 01:17:56,160
Dad...

522
01:18:01,400 --> 01:18:03,440
This is Eun-joo, in '96

523
01:18:03,560 --> 01:18:06,120
- I can't breathe...
- Wait just a minute

524
01:18:06,240 --> 01:18:08,800
I'm scared.

525
01:18:09,440 --> 01:18:13,200
Please don't kill me, sir

526
01:18:13,840 --> 01:18:15,920
Wait just a minute

527
01:18:44,040 --> 01:18:46,040
This is Yoo Jae-kyoung, 2000

528
01:19:05,440 --> 01:19:08,280
Baby... My baby...

529
01:19:38,440 --> 01:19:42,120
He was a teacher at English schools
in affluent neighborhoods

530
01:19:43,040 --> 01:19:45,960
He'd pick his victim, kidnap and
kill them,

531
01:19:46,080 --> 01:19:48,080
then move on to another school

532
01:19:49,280 --> 01:19:51,240
He'd never pick a child
from one of his own classes

533
01:19:51,360 --> 01:19:55,000
Which is why he was never
under any suspicion

534
01:19:57,120 --> 01:19:59,520
Children annoyed him,
so he would tape them

535
01:19:59,640 --> 01:20:03,800
right after kidnapping them
and killed them straight away

536
01:20:04,920 --> 01:20:10,240
The voices you heard on the line
while negotiating the ransom...

537
01:20:10,400 --> 01:20:13,480
were taped off the videos,
after the kids were already dead

538
01:20:18,120 --> 01:20:20,480
Now, you have two options

539
01:20:21,600 --> 01:20:23,960
If you want lawful punishment...

540
01:20:24,480 --> 01:20:27,600
We will hand him over to
Chief Choi here

541
01:20:28,120 --> 01:20:31,320
But if you want a speedier, more
personalized death for him...

542
01:20:31,480 --> 01:20:34,520
You can have it right here and now

543
01:20:34,640 --> 01:20:36,920
Does he have a child of his own?

544
01:20:38,080 --> 01:20:41,720
He is supposed to be sterile

545
01:20:41,840 --> 01:20:44,360
Then what did he need
all that money for?

546
01:20:46,320 --> 01:20:47,720
He put it in the bank

547
01:20:47,840 --> 01:20:50,720
Of course, the money will
all be returned to you...

548
01:20:50,840 --> 01:20:53,960
With no kid, what did he
need all that money for?

549
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:11,920
He was going to buy a yacht

550
01:21:19,320 --> 01:21:24,440
The police have big sticks but
they don't know how to use them

551
01:21:24,600 --> 01:21:28,400
If we leave it to them, there'd be
nothing but never-ending trials...

552
01:21:28,800 --> 01:21:30,120
And all those bloody reporters...

553
01:21:30,920 --> 01:21:33,680
How about we leave it
to Geum-ja?

554
01:21:33,800 --> 01:21:37,040
It'd be easier since
she's been to jail and all

555
01:21:37,160 --> 01:21:40,200
That's cowardly!
They're our kids

556
01:21:40,320 --> 01:21:43,960
Then, let each person choose
if they want to be in or not

557
01:21:44,080 --> 01:21:45,080
I'm for individual choice

558
01:21:45,240 --> 01:21:49,760
Why don't you just let him choose
his own death or trial, then...

559
01:21:49,920 --> 01:21:51,000
' Individually? '

560
01:21:51,160 --> 01:21:53,400
Little while ago, you wanted to
hand him over to the police

561
01:21:53,560 --> 01:21:55,240
Then you wanted to leave it
up to Geum-ja...

562
01:21:55,360 --> 01:21:59,960
Now you want to be left out alone?
What the hell do you want?

563
01:22:20,800 --> 01:22:23,040
Won-mo's family has to follow
the majority, too

564
01:22:23,160 --> 01:22:24,080
You know that, right?

565
01:22:24,240 --> 01:22:26,600
She has a weak heart...

566
01:22:28,760 --> 01:22:30,720
Hey, mine's weak, too

567
01:22:31,520 --> 01:22:33,720
Then Won-mo's father
can represent the family

568
01:22:34,120 --> 01:22:36,680
One person per family
should be enough

569
01:22:37,400 --> 01:22:38,320
Alright?

570
01:22:38,440 --> 01:22:41,360
What if Won-mo's mom
informs on us later?

571
01:22:41,520 --> 01:22:44,280
She couldn't.
Her husband's in on it, too

572
01:22:44,400 --> 01:22:46,200
They could always get divorced

573
01:22:47,000 --> 01:22:49,360
We can leave some evidence, then

574
01:22:49,480 --> 01:22:51,800
How about we all take a picture?

575
01:22:51,960 --> 01:22:54,600
So that even if we feel guilty later...

576
01:22:54,720 --> 01:22:56,160
Guilty?

577
01:22:56,280 --> 01:22:58,440
Guilt for killing that bastard?

578
01:22:58,560 --> 01:23:02,560
We'd feel guilty if we didn't kill him
when we had him. That's guilt!

579
01:23:02,720 --> 01:23:05,080
Let me say a word

580
01:23:09,600 --> 01:23:12,920
I killed when I was in prison...

581
01:23:13,920 --> 01:23:17,560
I'm also the one who caught Baek
after 13 years of planning...

582
01:23:19,320 --> 01:23:23,560
If anyone here
informs the police...

583
01:23:26,880 --> 01:23:29,400
I won't say any more

584
01:23:30,880 --> 01:23:32,400
Shall we go in one at a time?

585
01:23:32,520 --> 01:23:35,000
Or all together at once?

586
01:23:35,320 --> 01:23:37,960
One at a time for what?
Let's just go finish him off

587
01:23:38,080 --> 01:23:41,520
There's no need to share such
a personal matter with other families

588
01:23:41,920 --> 01:23:43,520
Isn't that right, dad?

589
01:23:46,920 --> 01:23:50,920
Won't it be scary going in alone?
And it could be dangerous

590
01:23:51,040 --> 01:23:53,120
Just think of it as using the toilet

591
01:23:54,400 --> 01:23:56,280
In any case, it's a private affair

592
01:23:56,480 --> 01:23:58,960
Each to his own.
A la carte...

593
01:23:59,080 --> 01:24:03,760
We don't all have to get
the same set menu

594
01:24:03,880 --> 01:24:05,200
Please, honey...

595
01:24:07,240 --> 01:24:10,760
We're divorced.
This isn't a couples thing!

596
01:24:11,480 --> 01:24:13,720
We don't have to go in together

597
01:24:16,840 --> 01:24:18,240
Excuse me, I think...

598
01:24:20,120 --> 01:24:24,680
It'd be too easy
if we did it all together

599
01:24:24,800 --> 01:24:25,920
Honey!

600
01:24:28,800 --> 01:24:32,600
I brought along a sedative

601
01:24:34,560 --> 01:24:40,400
You couldn't even touch
that finger, remember?

602
01:24:46,960 --> 01:24:48,440
Alright, then...

603
01:24:48,600 --> 01:24:50,480
Won-mo's father is out,

604
01:24:53,480 --> 01:24:55,280
and his mother will go in alone...

605
01:24:55,400 --> 01:24:59,560
Jae-kyoung's and Dong-hwa's
are going in together...

606
01:25:00,760 --> 01:25:02,840
- Is that right?
- Yes!

607
01:25:03,840 --> 01:25:04,840
Let's do it then!

608
01:25:06,520 --> 01:25:08,760
Wait! Just a second!

609
01:25:13,800 --> 01:25:17,520
Shouldn't we decide
what order you go in?

610
01:26:06,840 --> 01:26:09,560
Will that be enough for you?

611
01:26:11,440 --> 01:26:12,920
I can lend you mine after

612
01:26:14,800 --> 01:26:15,920
Well...

613
01:26:20,160 --> 01:26:21,560
I think I' II be okay

614
01:26:35,520 --> 01:26:37,000
Honey...

615
01:26:48,480 --> 01:26:49,760
Everyone pay attention

616
01:26:51,240 --> 01:26:54,160
If you grip it like this,
the tip of the knife

617
01:26:54,280 --> 01:26:57,920
will slip and not penetrate deeply

618
01:26:58,440 --> 01:27:04,280
You could also cut your hand

619
01:27:04,600 --> 01:27:10,000
So grip it like
this at all times, please

620
01:27:10,720 --> 01:27:14,480
Or you could just...

621
01:27:17,600 --> 01:27:18,720
stab him like this

622
01:27:40,520 --> 01:27:42,120
Why did you do it?

623
01:27:45,920 --> 01:27:48,160
You look like a normal person

624
01:27:50,120 --> 01:27:54,320
Why?

625
01:28:00,880 --> 01:28:06,520
Ma'am, there's no such thing
as a perfect person

626
01:28:59,280 --> 01:29:00,760
This...

627
01:29:05,040 --> 01:29:10,680
isn't gonna bring our son back,
is it, honey?

628
01:29:14,800 --> 01:29:16,000
Right?

629
01:29:28,440 --> 01:29:33,960
You all look very well off.
Take a look at that

630
01:29:35,160 --> 01:29:38,200
She took her boots off, so
not to get blood on the suede

631
01:29:38,320 --> 01:29:40,280
Does that make any sense
to you here?

632
01:29:43,320 --> 01:29:49,480
My mom had to scrub hotel floors
to send my brother to that school

633
01:29:50,400 --> 01:29:54,280
We ran around like dogs
to come up with the ransom

634
01:29:55,000 --> 01:29:59,640
Now we've lost our house and
our relatives won't see us

635
01:30:01,320 --> 01:30:04,560
My daughter-in-law killed herself
and my son left the country

636
01:30:05,640 --> 01:30:08,200
We all have our own stories to tell

637
01:30:20,880 --> 01:30:22,080
Dad!

638
01:30:22,800 --> 01:30:24,480
We're not the last, dad

639
01:30:25,000 --> 01:30:27,080
Eun-joo's grandma's
still waiting her turn

640
01:30:31,720 --> 01:30:33,400
Dad...

641
01:30:44,800 --> 01:30:46,760
Come on, give me a hand!

642
01:30:48,320 --> 01:30:51,240
Mister, get up

643
01:30:51,360 --> 01:30:55,360
Please. Get a hold of yourself!

644
01:33:39,320 --> 01:33:40,920
I'm sorry, but...

645
01:33:42,680 --> 01:33:46,080
Could you step aside a moment?

646
01:34:19,400 --> 01:34:20,880
Thank you

647
01:35:48,800 --> 01:35:53,240
Happy birthday to you...

648
01:36:00,880 --> 01:36:06,400
Happy birthday to you...

649
01:36:07,400 --> 01:36:12,120
Happy birthday dear...

650
01:36:16,400 --> 01:36:18,080
Happy...

651
01:36:23,120 --> 01:36:24,800
I'm sorry

652
01:36:25,440 --> 01:36:29,200
It felt like a birthday to me...

653
01:36:30,880 --> 01:36:32,880
We can say it is, then

654
01:36:33,960 --> 01:36:39,280
Happy birthday to you!

655
01:37:29,600 --> 01:37:31,760
Will you wire the money
into our accounts?

656
01:37:40,240 --> 01:37:42,400
My account number

657
01:37:52,120 --> 01:37:54,480
In France...

658
01:37:55,360 --> 01:37:58,480
when there's a break
in the conversation like this...

659
01:37:58,600 --> 01:38:01,760
they say an angel is passing

660
01:39:23,200 --> 01:39:24,800
It's snowing!

661
01:39:28,200 --> 01:39:29,680
The traffic...

662
01:39:30,240 --> 01:39:31,640
What time Is it now?

663
01:39:33,000 --> 01:39:35,640
- When did it all pile up so much?
- The roads will freeze soon

664
01:40:49,240 --> 01:40:50,480
Won-mo

665
01:40:55,880 --> 01:40:57,200
I have...

666
01:41:59,280 --> 01:42:03,240
Along the path on green grass...

667
01:42:03,360 --> 01:42:06,320
A lady in red heels goes...

668
01:42:07,400 --> 01:42:14,160
Click, click, click with her heels
Where might she be going?

669
01:42:15,560 --> 01:42:19,360
Won't she look back...

670
01:42:19,480 --> 01:42:21,400
Are you really going to
send Jenny back?

671
01:42:21,520 --> 01:42:24,840
Back my way for a glance?

672
01:42:25,240 --> 01:42:26,360
Are you?

673
01:42:26,880 --> 01:42:34,960
One step, two...

674
01:42:35,120 --> 01:42:41,800
The lady in red heels takes
another step away, alone...

675
01:42:51,440 --> 01:42:55,520
Lee Geum-ja made a great mistake
in her youth...

676
01:42:56,040 --> 01:43:00,600
And used other people
to achieve her own goals...

677
01:43:01,120 --> 01:43:07,280
But she still couldn't find the
redemption she so desired

678
01:43:23,080 --> 01:43:24,280
In spite of this...

679
01:43:24,920 --> 01:43:31,880
Actually, because of this...
I liked Geum-ja

680
01:43:59,240 --> 01:44:00,560
Be white

681
01:44:03,760 --> 01:44:05,440
Live white

682
01:44:07,520 --> 01:44:09,000
Like this

683
01:44:37,520 --> 01:44:38,520
You, too

684
01:46:37,960 --> 01:46:39,280
Farewell...

685
01:46:39,880 --> 01:46:41,360
Geum-ja!
