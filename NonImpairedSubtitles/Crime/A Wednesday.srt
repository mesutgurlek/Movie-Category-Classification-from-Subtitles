1
00:01:03,811 --> 00:01:04,971
I am retiring tomorrow.

2
00:01:06,247 --> 00:01:09,808
From past few weeks,
many people have asked me..

3
00:01:09,950 --> 00:01:13,545
.. that Mr. Prakash Rathod police
commissioner of Mumbai..

4
00:01:14,121 --> 00:01:18,956
.. that which was the most challenging
and interesting case of your life.

5
00:01:19,927 --> 00:01:23,556
I ignored this question.

6
00:01:23,864 --> 00:01:27,391
Every time.. but every time
I remembered only one case.

7
00:01:28,035 --> 00:01:31,471
This case is not registered
in any file anywhere.

8
00:01:31,939 --> 00:01:37,138
There is no record anywhere.
But it is in my mind..

9
00:01:38,045 --> 00:01:42,379
.. and some people who were involved
in this case unwillingly.

10
00:01:43,450 --> 00:01:44,849
That bastard.

11
00:01:46,153 --> 00:01:50,180
That bastard just had guts to walk
into our lives and blow it apart.

12
00:01:51,158 --> 00:01:52,750
It was a Wednesday.

13
00:04:30,317 --> 00:04:31,477
Hello! Where are you going?

14
00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:33,318
To file a FIR.

15
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:34,987
To the right. Room number 3.

16
00:04:38,392 --> 00:04:42,761
Who hit you?
- My wife.

17
00:04:42,863 --> 00:04:46,458
I wanted to file an FIR. -Then what
is there to be embarrassed about?

18
00:04:48,202 --> 00:04:50,534
How? - With a cooker.

19
00:04:53,874 --> 00:04:54,966
I want to file a complaint.

20
00:04:55,209 --> 00:04:58,201
Wait for a while.
I will call you. Have a seat.

21
00:05:01,114 --> 00:05:02,138
Why did she hit you?

22
00:05:02,382 --> 00:05:04,612
The problem was.. that..

23
00:05:04,818 --> 00:05:07,878
Come on. Speak up. There
are other people waiting.

24
00:05:08,121 --> 00:05:10,112
I just told her that there
was more salt in the food.

25
00:05:10,224 --> 00:05:11,486
She just flared up.

26
00:05:12,125 --> 00:05:14,355
There was a cooker to her right.

27
00:05:14,495 --> 00:05:16,224
She picked it and hit
me on my left side.

28
00:05:17,397 --> 00:05:22,300
Sir please.. just warn her once.
She keeps hitting me.

29
00:05:22,903 --> 00:05:25,428
You should never ever say
such things to your wife.

30
00:05:26,106 --> 00:05:28,131
Go home and say sorry.

31
00:05:28,242 --> 00:05:31,143
Or else instead of salt she will
put something else in your food.

32
00:05:31,245 --> 00:05:32,269
Did you understand?

33
00:05:32,846 --> 00:05:34,643
Don't take it too seriously. Go on.

34
00:05:34,781 --> 00:05:36,544
Sir, but file a report at least..
- Get lost!

35
00:05:40,854 --> 00:05:46,156
Hey mister, hello..
Mr. Jammu Kashmir please come.

36
00:05:55,168 --> 00:05:57,932
What happened?
- I lost my wallet.

37
00:05:58,539 --> 00:06:03,567
How? What do you mean by how?
How do things get lost?

38
00:06:04,144 --> 00:06:06,669
I mean, where was it lost?
- I don't remember.

39
00:06:06,780 --> 00:06:08,805
When I checked it wasn't with me.

40
00:06:10,284 --> 00:06:11,376
What were its contents?

41
00:06:11,518 --> 00:06:15,784
A photograph of my wife,
driving license. PAN card.

42
00:06:15,923 --> 00:06:17,515
Easy, easy. Sorry.

43
00:06:18,125 --> 00:06:21,356
PAN card, ATM card,
and credit card...

44
00:06:21,562 --> 00:06:27,228
...A railway pass.
Some cash. My wife's photograph.

45
00:06:27,367 --> 00:06:30,131
You have already said that.
- What?

46
00:06:30,237 --> 00:06:32,933
You have already told me about
your wife's photograph.

47
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:38,174
How much cash was in it?
- Around 300-350 rupees.

48
00:06:39,012 --> 00:06:42,448
Where is the washroom?
- What's your name and address?

49
00:06:43,183 --> 00:06:50,385
Rajesh Kumar Sharma. 301,
Mansarovar Society.

50
00:06:50,591 --> 00:06:53,958
S.V. Road, Borivali (west).

51
00:06:54,194 --> 00:06:59,359
Telephone number?
- 9832456784.

52
00:07:01,468 --> 00:07:03,197
Take this.
Call up tomorrow and enquire.

53
00:07:04,104 --> 00:07:06,504
The washroom is to the
right over there.

54
00:07:06,607 --> 00:07:07,699
Thank you.

55
00:08:11,071 --> 00:08:13,062
Sir, it's always a number from
Karachi that flashes on my mobile.

56
00:08:13,473 --> 00:08:18,934
initially, he used to address
me as brother, sir or boss.

57
00:08:19,813 --> 00:08:21,838
He had said his name was Imtiaz.

58
00:08:21,982 --> 00:08:23,609
He said he watches my
films many times..

59
00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:26,514
.. and that he was
a great fan of mine.

60
00:08:28,121 --> 00:08:30,646
Then he called today and
asked me to pay up 25 lakh rupees.

61
00:08:30,757 --> 00:08:32,486
Said it was an emergency.

62
00:08:34,561 --> 00:08:38,292
Mr. Arjun Khanna,
what exactly did he say?

63
00:08:51,712 --> 00:08:54,010
Crush, scene 20, shot 20, take 20.

64
00:08:55,315 --> 00:08:57,112
Help me, please!'

65
00:08:57,584 --> 00:09:00,485
'Please! Help me, please!'

66
00:09:08,061 --> 00:09:09,323
Thank you so much.

67
00:09:09,396 --> 00:09:11,330
Get up!

68
00:09:11,598 --> 00:09:12,690
Cut it!

69
00:09:12,799 --> 00:09:14,266
Oh god.

70
00:09:15,102 --> 00:09:17,969
Hey get the table. Good shot.
- Yeah thanks!

71
00:09:28,115 --> 00:09:29,139
Hello! -

72
00:09:29,282 --> 00:09:31,750
Why aren't you signing Desai's film?

73
00:09:32,119 --> 00:09:35,919
He is my special friend. If I don't
get any good news by noon.

74
00:09:36,022 --> 00:09:39,822
I will pack
- up your shooting forever.

75
00:09:40,127 --> 00:09:42,152
And keep 25 lakh rupees on hand.

76
00:09:42,295 --> 00:09:44,195
I will call you up later and
tell you whom to give it to

77
00:09:44,331 --> 00:09:45,355
25 lakhs!

78
00:09:45,499 --> 00:09:46,966
And why the hell do you delay
so much to take the call?

79
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:49,432
Make sure that you pick it up
within two rings the next time.

80
00:09:58,245 --> 00:10:00,509
Hello? - Just checking. '
Hang it up now.

81
00:10:12,726 --> 00:10:13,750
Where is Jai?

82
00:10:15,162 --> 00:10:17,323
You know that I don't like your
traveling in the train with the baby?

83
00:10:17,864 --> 00:10:20,389
If I go by road
I will reach tomorrow.

84
00:10:20,867 --> 00:10:22,562
Why do you go to your
mom's place so often?

85
00:10:22,936 --> 00:10:25,268
This is the first time I am
going since she was born.

86
00:10:25,405 --> 00:10:27,965
But she'd come to our house
just last week. - So?

87
00:10:29,176 --> 00:10:30,973
She was also there the
week before that. - So?

88
00:10:31,444 --> 00:10:33,674
This should stop.. Or else
the sub-inspector in..

89
00:10:33,814 --> 00:10:37,409
.. your mom's area is a
good friend of mine.

90
00:10:37,551 --> 00:10:38,950
Why are you so scared of my mom?

91
00:10:39,052 --> 00:10:40,679
Am not scared. Just
jealous of her..

92
00:10:40,821 --> 00:10:44,484
.. that she spends so much more
time with you two than me.

93
00:10:44,624 --> 00:10:48,890
Ok I will take your leave.
Bye. Take care. Bye.

94
00:10:49,963 --> 00:10:52,124
Call me up. - Yes, I will
call up on reaching there.

95
00:10:58,972 --> 00:11:00,599
Okay bye.
- Bye.

96
00:11:00,774 --> 00:11:02,503
See you. Take care.

97
00:11:03,176 --> 00:11:06,043
Just 20 rupees! Where is your
pollution certificate?

98
00:11:08,915 --> 00:11:10,746
Come on, sir. Keep it.

99
00:11:12,853 --> 00:11:15,287
Not even one document you have.
Take out the money.

100
00:11:16,756 --> 00:11:19,919
Where is your license? Look you
don't have license with you.

101
00:11:20,026 --> 00:11:23,962
Now come on, give me Rs. 500.

102
00:11:24,264 --> 00:11:26,255
Come on sir, take it. Keep it.

103
00:11:34,674 --> 00:11:35,766
Hello sir.

104
00:11:35,876 --> 00:11:36,900
What are you doing?

105
00:11:37,177 --> 00:11:40,408
Sir, I have stopped asking. But
they keep bribing me willingly.

106
00:11:40,547 --> 00:11:42,014
Ask him... Wasn't I telling
you not to give me anything?

107
00:11:42,148 --> 00:11:44,013
Sir, what can I do if they
give it with so much love?

108
00:11:44,150 --> 00:11:45,777
Too much of such love
has made you plump.

109
00:11:45,886 --> 00:11:47,547
And you still want some more.
- Sorry sir.

110
00:11:47,787 --> 00:11:49,687
How much did you take? - 20 rupees!

111
00:11:49,823 --> 00:11:51,848
Give it back!
- Take it.

112
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:54,824
Give him 20 more. - What?

113
00:11:55,896 --> 00:11:59,263
You should also share your
love with others. - Okay sir.

114
00:12:02,302 --> 00:12:03,929
Did you just give me money?

115
00:12:05,138 --> 00:12:07,129
Father was right and I was wrong.

116
00:12:08,108 --> 00:12:12,977
Times have changed. The New Age
is here - All right, go on.

117
00:12:14,147 --> 00:12:15,671
This is good! This is good!
This is good! This is good!

118
00:12:15,782 --> 00:12:17,477
This is good!

119
00:12:17,584 --> 00:12:21,076
Come on move aside! Move aside!

120
00:12:33,867 --> 00:12:37,064
Ready to move in! Three!
Two! One! Go!

121
00:12:37,203 --> 00:12:38,227
Thank you, Deepak.

122
00:12:38,438 --> 00:12:40,633
This is the same electric
pole to which..

123
00:12:40,807 --> 00:12:43,742
.. a man had been stuck to for
15 minutes and still survived.

124
00:12:44,177 --> 00:12:46,702
Yes. Shambu fell down
in this pothole..

125
00:12:46,813 --> 00:12:49,077
.. while returning from
work last evening.

126
00:12:49,215 --> 00:12:52,378
Because of this live wire
he got stuck to this pole.

127
00:12:52,485 --> 00:12:53,679
And it is a miracle that
he is still alive..

128
00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:55,685
.. after receiving electric shock..

129
00:12:55,822 --> 00:12:57,687
.. of such high voltage for
15 minutes. consecutively.

130
00:12:58,191 --> 00:13:03,891
So let's talk to Shambu who had
experienced this incident.

131
00:13:04,130 --> 00:13:06,360
Mr. Shambu, how do you feel?

132
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:08,728
I feel good.

133
00:13:09,169 --> 00:13:12,605
Tell our viewers how
did you feel when..

134
00:13:12,772 --> 00:13:15,764
.. such high voltage shocks were
passing through your body?

135
00:13:18,912 --> 00:13:21,039
Call for technical snag
in ten seconds.

136
00:13:21,181 --> 00:13:22,205
Naina, repeat the question.

137
00:13:22,349 --> 00:13:23,646
Tell us how did you feel when..

138
00:13:23,783 --> 00:13:27,549
.. high voltage shocks were
passing through you?

139
00:13:28,855 --> 00:13:31,289
Great! I felt very good.

140
00:13:32,425 --> 00:13:35,155
Now people call you
'The Electric man'.

141
00:13:35,261 --> 00:13:37,354
How does that feel?

142
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:42,225
Very good.
- Cut it!

143
00:13:42,369 --> 00:13:43,631
What is it, now?

144
00:13:44,938 --> 00:13:46,530
We'll do it again in five minutes!

145
00:13:46,773 --> 00:13:50,174
Give him something to say.
He seems to like everything.

146
00:13:51,945 --> 00:13:53,207
He gets drunk and falls down.

147
00:13:53,346 --> 00:13:54,711
The other day we both
drank together..

148
00:13:54,814 --> 00:13:56,679
.. and we both fell together
in the gutter but..

149
00:13:56,816 --> 00:13:58,010
.. nobody cared then. Now look
at him, he has become famous.

150
00:14:38,024 --> 00:14:39,218
Get me out of here.

151
00:14:41,127 --> 00:14:42,151
They beat me up every day.

152
00:14:42,262 --> 00:14:45,959
Two guys came in my cell
yesterday and beat me all over.

153
00:14:47,167 --> 00:14:48,998
You'd said I would be okay
if I turned informer.

154
00:14:49,335 --> 00:14:50,495
But look what happened?

155
00:14:53,139 --> 00:14:55,004
I was put to rot in here and you
were transferred to the ATS.

156
00:14:55,375 --> 00:14:57,468
Arif, either get me out
of this place or kill me.

157
00:14:57,610 --> 00:14:58,770
But don't leave me here.

158
00:14:59,179 --> 00:15:01,204
My family is threatened every day.

159
00:15:02,282 --> 00:15:06,446
The constable who is supposed to
protect my family harasses my sister.

160
00:15:10,156 --> 00:15:12,522
I have heard that you are going to
get transferred somewhere else?

161
00:15:13,493 --> 00:15:14,517
I heard it too.

162
00:15:14,828 --> 00:15:17,262
If the department doesn't care
about you why will it care for me?

163
00:15:17,997 --> 00:15:19,965
Can I get a cup of tea?
- Right away sir.

164
00:15:25,305 --> 00:15:28,365
You want to go to the hospital?
- Sure.

165
00:15:29,843 --> 00:15:32,209
Stay there for some days. I
will take care of the rest.

166
00:15:33,146 --> 00:15:35,979
You trust me, don't you?
- I have only you to trust.

167
00:15:44,524 --> 00:15:46,116
Thank you, brother.

168
00:15:51,598 --> 00:15:55,261
Who is on duty at your house?
- Badge number 1275.

169
00:15:58,171 --> 00:15:59,570
Sir, I feel that I am
being targeted..

170
00:15:59,739 --> 00:16:01,798
.. because I belong to
the minority group.

171
00:16:02,108 --> 00:16:06,704
Minority! Mr. Ajay Khanna, how can
you belong to a minority group?

172
00:16:08,081 --> 00:16:10,015
The Khan's are in majority
in our film industry.

173
00:16:10,283 --> 00:16:14,447
it’s just Mr. Amitabh, Abhishek
and I on the other side.

174
00:16:15,288 --> 00:16:17,017
That's true.

175
00:16:17,690 --> 00:16:18,714
Sir.

176
00:16:24,097 --> 00:16:26,088
Mr. Khanna, this is sub-inspector
Jai Singh.

177
00:16:26,566 --> 00:16:29,899
He will handle your case. Be rest
assured, we will crack this soon.

178
00:16:32,138 --> 00:16:33,366
Sir, I just hope nothing
will happen to me.

179
00:16:33,506 --> 00:16:35,201
C'mon! You are a hero.

180
00:16:35,341 --> 00:16:36,774
Does anything ever happen to
our heroes in our films?

181
00:16:37,911 --> 00:16:39,435
Sometimes it does.

182
00:16:39,579 --> 00:16:41,638
Just in case anything
happens to you then..

183
00:16:41,781 --> 00:16:44,545
.. I assure you that we
will not spare them.

184
00:16:44,751 --> 00:16:46,116
Sir, what are you..?

185
00:16:46,219 --> 00:16:49,382
Relax! Go to work. Nothing
will happen to you.

186
00:16:49,522 --> 00:16:51,012
Thank you sir. Thank you very much.

187
00:16:51,157 --> 00:16:52,181
It is okay.

188
00:16:56,329 --> 00:16:57,557
My brother. My brother.

189
00:16:59,966 --> 00:17:01,456
Thank you! Thank you.

190
00:17:03,269 --> 00:17:04,429
Thank you, sir.
- Yeah, mention not.

191
00:17:07,974 --> 00:17:11,410
These are our heroes. One phone
call and he gets a stomach ache

192
00:17:11,544 --> 00:17:13,171
Some kids from Shanti Nagar
are playing a prank on him.

193
00:17:13,313 --> 00:17:14,337
Patwardhan knows them.

194
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:18,041
Ask him to stop them or else he
will be wasting our time needlessly.

195
00:17:18,184 --> 00:17:19,208
Right sir.

196
00:17:21,387 --> 00:17:23,787
Shambu, who is responsible
for this incident?

197
00:17:24,123 --> 00:17:27,354
I feel they did a good job by
putting up an electric pole.

198
00:17:27,493 --> 00:17:29,222
But they should not have
dug this hole.

199
00:17:30,129 --> 00:17:32,597
The government should think
twice before digging..

200
00:17:32,765 --> 00:17:36,895
.. that a common man like me
can fall into this pothole.

201
00:17:37,136 --> 00:17:39,297
Look around! Today there
are potholes everywhere.

202
00:17:39,505 --> 00:17:42,201
I mean are there potholes in the
city or this city is in potholes?

203
00:17:42,342 --> 00:17:44,207
This government should take
responsibility for these potholes.

204
00:17:45,178 --> 00:17:48,147
So what do you feel? Why does
the government do such things?

205
00:17:48,514 --> 00:17:50,379
The government likes to dig.

206
00:17:51,184 --> 00:17:53,652
So this was Mr. Shambu. k.a.
Electric man who..

207
00:17:53,786 --> 00:17:55,879
.. has given Death itself
a very big shock.

208
00:17:56,322 --> 00:17:58,790
This is Naina Roy with cameraman
Raj for UTV news.

209
00:18:24,350 --> 00:18:28,480
Sir.. sir, why are you hitting me?

210
00:18:33,293 --> 00:18:35,761
Sir, why are you hitting me?

211
00:19:59,312 --> 00:20:00,677
Yes, tell me!
- Don't get annoyed but..

212
00:20:00,780 --> 00:20:02,645
.. I just found out that
I don't have..

213
00:20:02,782 --> 00:20:05,148
.. some ingredients to
make the rice pudding.

214
00:20:05,585 --> 00:20:07,450
You know very well
Ishaan loves rice pudding.

215
00:20:08,321 --> 00:20:09,686
While coming home bring
some almonds, raisins..

216
00:20:09,789 --> 00:20:11,313
All right I will bring
all those things.

217
00:20:11,424 --> 00:20:13,187
Don't forget to buy those tomatoes.
- No I won't.

218
00:20:14,394 --> 00:20:16,555
I am sorry. Are you angry with me?

219
00:20:17,530 --> 00:20:22,934
Just a bit. But then, I have the
whole city to vent it out.

220
00:20:23,369 --> 00:20:24,393
When will you come back?

221
00:20:24,537 --> 00:20:25,561
Around 7 o'clock.

222
00:20:25,938 --> 00:20:27,929
Come back and we'll talk.
- Yes.

223
00:21:13,786 --> 00:21:16,653
The government should think
twice before digging..

224
00:21:16,789 --> 00:21:19,189
.. that a common man like me
can fall into this pothole.

225
00:21:19,392 --> 00:21:21,155
Look around! Today there
are potholes everywhere.

226
00:21:21,794 --> 00:21:24,524
I mean are there potholes in the
city or this city is in potholes?

227
00:21:25,131 --> 00:21:26,393
This government should take
responsibility for these potholes.

228
00:21:43,816 --> 00:21:44,510
Sir, please forgive me.

229
00:44:38,998 --> 00:44:41,432
Hello.
- Is it Commissioner Prakash Rathod?

230
00:44:41,567 --> 00:44:42,591
Who's this?

231
00:44:42,735 --> 00:44:44,965
Mr. Rathod, don't interrupt
and just listen.

232
00:44:46,572 --> 00:44:50,668
I have planted bombs at 5 different
locations in the city.

233
00:44:51,744 --> 00:44:55,373
All these bombs will
explode at 6.30 pm.

234
00:44:56,582 --> 00:45:01,281
But this can be avoided.
I will call you up 30 minutes later..

235
00:45:01,420 --> 00:45:06,016
.. with my demands and I want to talk
or negotiate with only one person.

236
00:45:06,959 --> 00:45:09,689
Until then you can decide
on that person.

237
00:45:11,364 --> 00:45:12,388
Hello!

238
00:45:19,238 --> 00:45:21,798
Find out who had called
on my mobile just a while back.

239
00:45:23,009 --> 00:45:24,033
Jai, where is the chief minister?

240
00:45:31,551 --> 00:45:33,143
Hello.
- Miss Naina Roy?

241
00:45:33,719 --> 00:45:34,743
Yes, who is this?

242
00:45:34,854 --> 00:45:38,255
It doesn't matter.
I just wanted to ask you..

243
00:45:38,391 --> 00:45:42,122
.. whether you are interested
in some serious news.

244
00:45:42,395 --> 00:45:45,421
What? Is this some kind..
- Just answer me Naina.

245
00:45:46,933 --> 00:45:51,165
This is big. Are you interested?
Yes or no?

246
00:45:54,740 --> 00:45:55,764
Yes.

247
00:45:55,875 --> 00:45:57,968
Then come to the Mumbai Police
headquarters with your cameraman.

248
00:45:58,411 --> 00:46:01,175
This is going to be the most
important day in your life.

249
00:46:01,948 --> 00:46:02,972
I will call you again.

250
00:46:05,585 --> 00:46:06,609
Raj!

251
01:10:05,794 --> 01:10:07,022
I know this is an unknown number.

252
01:10:07,162 --> 01:10:09,460
Keep trying. I want to know
that number within 5 minutes.

253
01:10:09,965 --> 01:10:12,763
And ask Khatri to tap my mobile
phone immediately. Okay.

254
01:10:14,336 --> 01:10:16,770
Yes Tiwari, I am putting him
on the line. Right away.

255
01:10:16,872 --> 01:10:17,964
Sir, it's Tiwari.

256
01:10:18,073 --> 01:10:20,166
Mr. Tiwari!
- Yes, Mr. Prakash, tell me.

257
01:10:20,275 --> 01:10:21,299
Where is the CM?

258
01:10:21,810 --> 01:10:23,402
He is in Bandra to attend
an important meeting.

259
01:10:23,545 --> 01:10:24,569
Put Mr. Patil on the line.

260
01:10:25,147 --> 01:10:27,581
Mr. Patil is also in a meeting.
Tell me, what is the matter?

261
01:10:27,816 --> 01:10:29,408
It is a very minor thing.
I cannot bother you with it.

262
01:10:29,551 --> 01:10:30,779
Put Patil on the line.

263
01:10:32,154 --> 01:10:33,280
Sir, I hope you understood.

264
01:10:33,422 --> 01:10:34,787
Sir, he wants to talk to you.

265
01:10:34,890 --> 01:10:35,914
Excuse me.
- Okay.

266
01:10:36,058 --> 01:10:37,082
Yes, Mr. Prakash.

267
01:10:37,225 --> 01:10:39,591
I don't know how but come to
my office within 15 minutes.

268
01:10:39,828 --> 01:10:41,386
But.. - Within 15 minutes.
it’s an emergency.

269
01:10:41,997 --> 01:10:43,396
Jai, tell Chouhan, Ramesh and Aakash
to come into the WAR Room.

270
01:10:43,498 --> 01:10:44,522
Right sir.

271
01:10:50,172 --> 01:10:51,605
Sir. It is a prepaid mobile number.

272
01:10:51,707 --> 01:10:52,674
It is registered to
one Jignesh Sheth.

273
01:10:52,841 --> 01:10:54,604
He lives in Malad. I have informed
Malad police station.

274
01:10:54,910 --> 01:10:57,003
This number is unreachable
right now. - Okay.

275
01:11:00,849 --> 01:11:01,873
Attention guys!

276
01:11:50,432 --> 01:11:52,059
This matter should not
get out of this room.

277
01:11:52,834 --> 01:11:56,099
Does anyone of you wants to
call anybody or warn anyone?

278
01:11:56,238 --> 01:11:57,262
No sir!

279
01:12:03,411 --> 01:12:05,106
We have just 4 hours left.

280
01:12:05,247 --> 01:12:08,808
Chouhan, talk to Abbas at intelligence
and find out what they have.

281
01:12:08,950 --> 01:12:11,544
Tell them you need this information
for verification.

282
01:12:11,653 --> 01:12:12,745
Yes sir!

283
01:12:17,325 --> 01:12:18,690
Vatkar, find out from
our sources whether..

284
01:12:18,794 --> 01:12:20,955
.. there has been any movement
in any terrorist module.

285
01:12:21,263 --> 01:12:23,424
Get me any information on explosives
being taken in and out of the city.

286
01:12:23,565 --> 01:12:24,862
Get in touch with your informers.

287
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:26,024
Right sir.

288
01:12:26,168 --> 01:12:27,692
Aakash, we need to trace
the call the next time.

289
01:12:27,803 --> 01:12:28,827
Put your best men on the job.

290
01:12:28,970 --> 01:12:29,994
Yes sir!

291
01:12:33,809 --> 01:12:35,640
Mr. Rathod, how are you?
- I am fine. And you?

292
01:12:35,811 --> 01:12:36,835
Fine. Tell me.

293
01:12:37,145 --> 01:12:38,942
Just a while back I received
a call on my cell phone.

294
01:12:39,047 --> 01:12:40,071
One man..

295
01:13:15,116 --> 01:13:17,607
Oh god. Excuse me.

296
01:13:51,820 --> 01:13:52,844
It could also be a crank call.

297
01:13:52,988 --> 01:13:54,080
We can't take any chances.
Where is the CM?

298
01:13:54,222 --> 01:13:55,246
He is on his way.

299
01:14:30,725 --> 01:14:31,749
Hello!

300
01:14:31,860 --> 01:14:35,261
Yes, Mr. Rathod. Who is
going to talk to me?

301
01:14:35,797 --> 01:14:38,391
Mr. Roy. He will be here soon.
Until then you can talk to me.

302
01:14:38,800 --> 01:14:42,361
I will only talk to the person who
has the authority to take decisions.

303
01:14:42,470 --> 01:14:43,994
I will call you again
in five minutes.

304
01:14:45,140 --> 01:14:49,201
By the way let me remind you that
you are wasting your own time.

305
01:14:50,345 --> 01:14:53,781
Take my advice. You shouldn't
buy time on this.

306
01:14:57,152 --> 01:14:59,780
Too short to trace. But this is not
the same number as the previous one.

307
01:15:00,155 --> 01:15:01,179
Excuse me sir.

308
01:15:03,558 --> 01:15:04,957
There was a call from
Malad police station.

309
01:15:05,160 --> 01:15:06,957
Nobody named Jignesh Sheth
lives at that address.

310
01:15:08,229 --> 01:15:11,164
Do one thing, tell Solanki to
alert all the police stations.

311
01:15:11,766 --> 01:15:12,926
Sir, the CM is on the line.

312
01:15:16,338 --> 01:15:17,965
Good afternoon, sir.
- Good afternoon.

313
01:15:18,106 --> 01:15:20,370
Who is this Roy?
- Nobody.

314
01:15:20,508 --> 01:15:21,805
Who is negotiating with
him from our side?

315
01:15:21,943 --> 01:15:23,808
Sir, you will. We will patch
his call to you from here.

316
01:15:24,779 --> 01:15:29,546
Why? -Because you have the authority
and you know how to negotiate.

317
01:15:32,120 --> 01:15:34,520
There is a lot of difference between
giving a Speech and Negotiating.

318
01:15:34,956 --> 01:15:35,980
This is not a political rally.

319
01:15:36,124 --> 01:15:38,285
What about Patil or Tiwari?

320
01:15:38,960 --> 01:15:39,984
Oh my God!

321
01:15:40,128 --> 01:15:43,063
Prakash, I have never seen you
running away from responsibility.

322
01:15:43,198 --> 01:15:44,222
There is a reason for it.

323
01:15:45,533 --> 01:15:46,659
If this man is telling
the truth then to stop him..

324
01:15:46,801 --> 01:15:49,361
.. we require a person with
unlimited authority.

325
01:15:49,804 --> 01:15:51,271
There shouldn't be any
red tape or protocol.

326
01:15:51,806 --> 01:15:54,036
He would need absolute
and complete freedom.

327
01:15:54,175 --> 01:15:57,770
He should not be questioned
about anything.

328
01:15:58,813 --> 01:16:00,644
And I know that this is not
possible and that's why..

329
01:16:00,815 --> 01:16:03,283
.. I was running away from
responsibility Sir.

330
01:16:04,819 --> 01:16:07,788
Patil, this operation will be
headed by Prakash Rathod.

331
01:16:08,156 --> 01:16:11,284
I don't want any complaints
from him. Do you understand?

332
01:16:11,426 --> 01:16:12,450
I'll be there soon.

333
01:16:12,761 --> 01:16:14,695
Yes, sir. Should we
inform the center?

334
01:16:14,829 --> 01:16:17,263
This is our problem and
we have to solve it.

335
01:16:17,832 --> 01:16:18,856
Okay sir.

336
01:16:19,367 --> 01:16:21,028
Come on guys, back to work,
everyone.

337
01:16:24,172 --> 01:16:25,196
Excuse me.
- Yeah.

338
01:16:29,377 --> 01:16:30,969
Hello.
- Mr. Rathod?

339
01:16:31,246 --> 01:16:33,180
Mr. Roy won't be here. I will
negotiate instead of him.

340
01:16:33,281 --> 01:16:35,613
How can he come there
if he doesn't exist?

341
01:16:35,717 --> 01:16:36,809
What do you want?

342
01:16:36,918 --> 01:16:40,581
Ibrahim Khan, Iqlak Ahmed, Mohammed
Zaheer and Khursheed Lala.

343
01:16:41,189 --> 01:16:42,486
Who are these guys?

344
01:16:43,858 --> 01:16:47,259
You yourself had caught two of them.
And the ATS got the other two.

345
01:16:47,862 --> 01:16:48,886
I hope it is not difficult.

346
01:16:49,030 --> 01:16:51,726
Why would it be? We are used to it.

347
01:16:52,200 --> 01:16:53,724
First we put our lives at
stake and catch them and..

348
01:16:53,868 --> 01:16:55,631
.. then when a phone call
comes we set them free.

349
01:16:55,737 --> 01:16:57,295
You will do the same thing today.

350
01:16:58,206 --> 01:17:02,643
They all are in different places
right now. I'll call you in an hour.

351
01:17:03,211 --> 01:17:06,305
Till then it is your job to get
them together at one place.

352
01:17:06,448 --> 01:17:07,779
On whose behalf are you doing this?

353
01:17:07,882 --> 01:17:09,247
What is the name of
your organization?

354
01:17:11,386 --> 01:17:15,322
Do you suspect that this
is a crank call? -

355
01:17:15,757 --> 01:17:16,781
I do.

356
01:17:17,826 --> 01:17:20,693
Mr. Rathod, you must
know by now that..

357
01:17:20,829 --> 01:17:23,263
.. Jignesh Sheth had died
in the last bomb blast.

358
01:17:23,832 --> 01:17:25,697
The next number belonged
to Sanjay Singh..

359
01:17:25,834 --> 01:17:28,064
.. who had died three months back.

360
01:17:28,436 --> 01:17:30,666
The current number that you
will trace belongs to..

361
01:17:30,839 --> 01:17:33,467
.. Shabbir Ahmed who has also
died a long way back.

362
01:17:33,608 --> 01:17:36,133
Any Tom, Dick and Harry can do this.

363
01:17:36,244 --> 01:17:38,678
Yes I agree. But any Tom,
Dick and Harry..

364
01:17:38,847 --> 01:17:40,678
.. cannot blow away
the police station..

365
01:17:40,849 --> 01:17:43,545
.. which is just opposite
your Police headquarters.

366
01:17:43,985 --> 01:17:45,009
What do you mean?

367
01:17:45,120 --> 01:17:48,715
It means I have also planted a
bomb in the police station..

368
01:17:48,857 --> 01:17:52,725
.. opposite your headquarters
just to prove..

369
01:17:52,861 --> 01:17:56,627
.. my mettle and your helplessness.

370
01:17:57,465 --> 01:18:01,561
You have 20 minutes to
find it. So go find it.

371
01:18:02,203 --> 01:18:04,603
Or else an hour later I may
have to talk to someone else.

372
01:18:12,347 --> 01:18:14,645
Mr. Prakash, can we go
out for half an hour.

373
01:18:14,816 --> 01:18:15,908
Jai!
- Yes sir!

374
01:18:16,050 --> 01:18:16,277
Are you afraid?
- No sir.

375
01:18:17,385 --> 01:18:18,784
Are you married?
- Two years ago.

376
01:18:18,887 --> 01:18:20,548
Do you have a kid?
- I have a 3-month-old daughter.

377
01:18:20,655 --> 01:18:21,986
What happens if you die?
- I don't care.

378
01:18:22,090 --> 01:18:24,115
I want that bomb found within
ten minutes. - You'll get it, sir.

379
01:18:32,834 --> 01:18:34,597
Give me your radio. - Sir.

380
01:18:42,710 --> 01:18:43,802
Hello.

381
01:18:43,912 --> 01:18:45,675
Naina Roy, someone
has planted a bomb..

382
01:18:45,847 --> 01:18:48,475
.. in the police station opposite
the headquarters.

383
01:18:49,250 --> 01:18:50,945
I thought you'd be interested.

384
01:18:52,187 --> 01:18:53,211
Oh God!

385
01:18:53,855 --> 01:18:56,949
Relax guys! This man wants
us to find the bomb.

386
01:18:57,859 --> 01:19:01,090
He wants us to take him seriously.
He wants us to find it.

387
01:19:25,386 --> 01:19:29,584
We just have one hour. I don't
want to talk to this man again.

388
01:19:30,358 --> 01:19:31,848
Sir, Chouhan is on the line.

389
01:19:33,161 --> 01:19:34,185
Chouhan, tell me.

390
01:19:34,295 --> 01:19:35,785
Sir, the intelligence has
no information about this.

391
01:19:35,897 --> 01:19:37,159
That's consistent.

392
01:19:38,166 --> 01:19:40,964
Chouhan, step up security at airports,
rail stations and bus depots.

393
01:19:41,069 --> 01:19:42,661
Search everything and everyone.

394
01:19:42,870 --> 01:19:45,202
Send them in batches of 4
to the multiplexes as well.

395
01:19:45,306 --> 01:19:47,297
I want you to cover up as
much ground as possible.

396
01:19:47,442 --> 01:19:48,670
If someone asks tell them
it is just a police drill..

397
01:19:48,843 --> 01:19:50,174
.. or tell them it's the CM's orders.

398
01:19:50,278 --> 01:19:51,302
Get on it now!

399
01:19:54,849 --> 01:19:56,009
All units alert, sir.

400
01:19:56,117 --> 01:19:57,141
Deshmukh, where is my bomb squad?

401
01:20:04,425 --> 01:20:07,223
Aakash, call up Arif. I
want him here a. s. a. p.

402
01:20:07,362 --> 01:20:08,659
And I want an update on Ibrahim
Khan, Iqlak Ahmed..

403
01:20:08,796 --> 01:20:11,356
.. Mohammad Zaheer
and Khursheed Lala.

404
01:20:11,466 --> 01:20:12,763
You've got ten minutes.
- Yes sir.

405
01:20:15,136 --> 01:20:16,160
Then send them here!

406
01:20:20,141 --> 01:20:21,540
Bomb squad! Come in!
Bomb squad! Come in!

407
01:20:53,574 --> 01:20:56,600
Has nobody seen Baburao?
Yeah Mhatre, come in.

408
01:20:56,844 --> 01:20:58,402
Copy that.

409
01:21:06,454 --> 01:21:08,319
What is it?
- Sir, it is RDX.

410
01:21:11,125 --> 01:21:14,060
Come here! A bomb was
placed right under nose!

411
01:21:14,329 --> 01:21:16,763
What the hell were you doing?
Who is the shift in-charge?

412
01:21:16,864 --> 01:21:18,764
Sir, there was a shift change
just half an hour ago.

413
01:21:18,866 --> 01:21:19,890
I don't know anything.

414
01:21:20,034 --> 01:21:22,264
Find him in 5 minutes and
send him to me. - Okay sir.

415
01:21:22,403 --> 01:21:24,928
Sir! We have located the bomb.
It is RDX.

416
01:21:25,039 --> 01:21:26,563
He had planned to trigger
it with a cell phone.

417
01:21:26,674 --> 01:21:27,766
Good.

418
01:21:29,410 --> 01:21:31,401
Sir, please come this way.
I have solid information.

419
01:21:31,546 --> 01:21:32,945
There has been a pull-up
from the underworld.

420
01:21:33,047 --> 01:21:34,776
He had supplied 6 kgs of
RDX couple of days back.

421
01:21:34,882 --> 01:21:35,906
He has not opened his mouth yet.

422
01:21:36,050 --> 01:21:37,074
On threatening him he
said he has taken..

423
01:21:37,218 --> 01:21:38,242
.. his painkillers
just this morning.

424
01:21:38,386 --> 01:21:39,410
That's a new one.

425
01:21:45,827 --> 01:21:46,885
Sir, I don't know anything!

426
01:21:47,028 --> 01:21:48,586
Did I ask you anything?
Did I ask you anything?

427
01:21:51,466 --> 01:21:54,594
Did I ask you anything?
Did I ask you anything?

428
01:21:58,439 --> 01:21:59,667
Did I ask you anything?
Did I ask you anything?

429
01:22:05,179 --> 01:22:06,612
Nobody has confirmed this
information but..

430
01:22:06,781 --> 01:22:09,511
.. suddenly there is a lot of
activity in the police station.

431
01:22:09,784 --> 01:22:12,116
You can see the bomb squad
and the sniffer dogs here.

432
01:22:12,220 --> 01:22:13,244
They have just come out.

433
01:22:13,388 --> 01:22:15,913
But we have been denied
any information about it.

434
01:22:16,023 --> 01:22:17,650
We would like to inform our
viewers once again that..

435
01:22:17,792 --> 01:22:19,657
.. we had received information..

436
01:22:19,794 --> 01:22:21,261
.. about the bomb via
a telephone call.

437
01:22:21,396 --> 01:22:23,193
Seems that the bomb has
been found and diffused.

438
01:22:23,331 --> 01:22:26,232
We have not received
any confirmation yet.

439
01:22:26,367 --> 01:22:27,959
But we will keep trying.

440
01:22:28,169 --> 01:22:31,536
From Mumbai this is Naina Roy with
cameraman Raj for UTV news. - Over.

441
01:22:31,806 --> 01:22:33,637
I want the forensic report
immediately in the WAR room.

442
01:22:33,808 --> 01:22:35,036
Sir! - Okay sir.

443
01:22:40,681 --> 01:22:41,773
Thank you.

444
01:22:46,988 --> 01:22:49,388
Mhatre come in. copy.

445
01:22:51,826 --> 01:22:54,590
Sir, the Psycho has arrived.
Someone's going to die today.

446
01:22:59,434 --> 01:23:01,026
Hello.
- Are you busy?

447
01:23:01,169 --> 01:23:02,602
Yes. Not really.

448
01:23:02,870 --> 01:23:04,360
We have reached here safely.

449
01:23:04,839 --> 01:23:06,466
How is mom?
- She is fine.

450
01:23:06,774 --> 01:23:07,832
Give it to me.

451
01:23:09,911 --> 01:23:11,173
What is the matter?
Are you worried about something?

452
01:23:11,779 --> 01:23:14,247
Not at all. - I'll call
you before leaving.

453
01:23:15,349 --> 01:23:16,748
Okay. Take care. Bye.

454
01:23:16,951 --> 01:23:18,543
There was no direct
contact with me.

455
01:23:18,786 --> 01:23:19,878
I only gave the delivery.

456
01:23:20,788 --> 01:23:23,416
I got a message to deliver
that bag to Rafiq.

457
01:23:24,125 --> 01:23:27,754
He was Rafiq's customer.
I asked Rafiq who he was.

458
01:23:28,129 --> 01:23:31,030
He said, your place is behind
and asked me to shut up.

459
01:23:32,400 --> 01:23:33,492
Where can I find Rafiq?

460
01:23:34,135 --> 01:23:36,831
Sir, I don't know.
If I had known I would tell you.

461
01:23:37,138 --> 01:23:38,969
Believe me. sir, I would..

462
01:23:49,817 --> 01:23:51,910
Bohri Market. 4th Lane.

463
01:23:53,821 --> 01:23:54,845
Where are you these days?

464
01:23:54,989 --> 01:23:57,583
I am with the ATS.
You had got me transferred.

465
01:23:57,825 --> 01:23:59,690
Yes. Arif, I want that man and
the information that he has.

466
01:23:59,827 --> 01:24:01,920
Vatkar will tell you where
to find him. Don't kill him.

467
01:24:02,063 --> 01:24:03,087
I just need the information.

468
01:24:03,231 --> 01:24:04,255
Okay sir.
- Okay.

469
01:24:05,433 --> 01:24:06,923
Yes.
- Sir, the bomb has been diffused.

470
01:24:07,435 --> 01:24:09,232
Who was on duty?
- Prashant.

471
01:24:09,770 --> 01:24:12,204
Tell him to go home. He will receive
his termination letter tomorrow.

472
01:24:12,340 --> 01:24:13,739
Tell Kailash to take over.

473
01:24:14,108 --> 01:24:16,133
The media is here. UTV news.

474
01:24:17,945 --> 01:24:19,412
Bring them upstairs.
- Right sir.

475
01:24:25,520 --> 01:24:28,182
Ibrahim Khan. He has links
with the Al-Qaeda.

476
01:24:28,322 --> 01:24:30,381
He was head-of-operations
in India since 92.

477
01:24:30,791 --> 01:24:32,759
This is his designation
on their website.

478
01:24:33,127 --> 01:24:35,652
He has started 45 madrasas
in the country..

479
01:24:35,796 --> 01:24:38,560
.. where little kids are taught
the meaning of Jihad.

480
01:24:38,799 --> 01:24:40,664
On his capture they will
be weakened and if..

481
01:24:40,801 --> 01:24:43,565
.. he is set free then they will
be completely rejuvenated.

482
01:24:43,804 --> 01:24:45,772
This is their second
attempt to free him.

483
01:24:45,873 --> 01:24:47,033
He is extremely dangerous.

484
01:24:52,413 --> 01:24:56,144
Iqlak Ahmed. Al Qaeda again.
Right hand of Ibrahim Khan.

485
01:24:56,250 --> 01:24:58,684
He is a former ISl agent.
The theory is that..

486
01:24:58,819 --> 01:25:00,844
.. when you had nabbed him
he wanted to get caught.

487
01:25:00,988 --> 01:25:03,183
So that it would be easy
to free Ibrahim Khan.

488
01:25:03,291 --> 01:25:05,691
He was directly or indirectly
involved in all..

489
01:25:05,826 --> 01:25:08,294
.. the terrorists attacks in India
in the last three years.

490
01:25:08,396 --> 01:25:09,795
He is equally dangerous if not more.

491
01:25:14,368 --> 01:25:16,836
Mohammad Zaheer. He is the number
2 agent of Laskar in India.

492
01:25:16,971 --> 01:25:18,734
He is a former ISl as well
as former Al Qaeda member.

493
01:25:19,106 --> 01:25:20,596
He was a software engineer.

494
01:25:20,775 --> 01:25:22,868
Due to systematic brainwashing
he went to Pakistan.

495
01:25:23,010 --> 01:25:24,034
From there he went to Afghanistan.

496
01:25:24,178 --> 01:25:25,202
He acquired his training over there.

497
01:25:25,346 --> 01:25:27,211
He has designed a lot
of websites for them.

498
01:25:27,348 --> 01:25:30,749
One of his websites is called
www. indiakitabaahi. com

499
01:25:30,851 --> 01:25:32,409
Very basic but very effective.

500
01:25:32,553 --> 01:25:34,953
It registered record number
of hits the day it opened.

501
01:25:35,056 --> 01:25:37,183
He is in our C-Zone hospital
since last week.

502
01:25:37,325 --> 01:25:38,917
He had complained of chest pains.

503
01:25:43,998 --> 01:25:46,330
Khursheed Lala. He is an arms pimp.

504
01:25:46,434 --> 01:25:49,232
He is not connected to just one
organization but with all of them.

505
01:25:49,437 --> 01:25:52,372
If you need arms and explosives
then this is your Guy.

506
01:25:52,473 --> 01:25:54,566
He will supply any
quantity you want.

507
01:25:54,809 --> 01:25:58,768
No matter it is 1993 or 2006.
Lala is behind the bars or free.

508
01:25:59,146 --> 01:26:00,579
He doesn't leave a trail.

509
01:26:00,815 --> 01:26:02,646
Sir, you may remember that
even when you had arrested him..

510
01:26:02,817 --> 01:26:04,648
.. we had only found
a blue-print of..

511
01:26:04,819 --> 01:26:07,344
.. the Mumbai city and
a revolver on him.

512
01:26:07,455 --> 01:26:09,548
Very soon he will be out on bail.

513
01:26:11,425 --> 01:26:12,585
Sir, Here is a speculation.

514
01:26:13,160 --> 01:26:16,152
Look at this. We don't know his
name but he is everywhere.

515
01:26:16,831 --> 01:26:18,389
He has succeeded to
remain out of sight.

516
01:26:18,833 --> 01:26:21,267
Our intelligence agencies have
no information about him.

517
01:26:21,402 --> 01:26:23,302
There are only rumours.

518
01:26:23,838 --> 01:26:26,671
Some say he is their CEO and others
say he is the chief strategist.

519
01:26:27,174 --> 01:26:28,607
Sir, he is one among the crowd.

520
01:26:28,843 --> 01:26:32,074
Even his wife doesn't know
what he really does.

521
01:26:32,446 --> 01:26:34,073
This man could be behind this call.

522
01:26:53,200 --> 01:26:56,067
He may belong to Laskar, Al
Qaeda or some other outfit.

523
01:26:56,270 --> 01:26:58,238
We don't know whether he
is in the country or not.

524
01:26:58,873 --> 01:27:01,398
There must be a couple of people
with him in this operation.

525
01:27:01,876 --> 01:27:03,468
They have already targeted the
stock exchange..

526
01:27:03,611 --> 01:27:04,839
.. buses and local trains.

527
01:27:04,945 --> 01:27:07,038
I suspect this time they
will go a step further.

528
01:27:07,948 --> 01:27:09,643
That they have come so close
to the police headquarters..

529
01:27:09,817 --> 01:27:11,011
.. has business written all over it.

530
01:27:12,153 --> 01:27:14,587
Aakash, this man is in the city.
We have to catch him.

531
01:27:14,822 --> 01:27:15,914
Sir, what should we do
about the other four?

532
01:27:16,057 --> 01:27:18,389
We are always two steps behind
them and if they are freed..

533
01:27:18,492 --> 01:27:19,584
Let them be where they are.

534
01:27:20,361 --> 01:27:21,726
It doesn't make any sense
to free Lala now..

535
01:27:21,829 --> 01:27:23,421
.. he is going to get free as is.

536
01:27:23,831 --> 01:27:25,594
And by doing this Lala will be
regarded a certified terrorist.

537
01:27:26,167 --> 01:27:27,600
Maybe they need Lala right now.

538
01:27:28,169 --> 01:27:29,193
Maybe.

539
01:27:31,405 --> 01:27:32,429
Uncle! Three tea.

540
01:27:32,840 --> 01:27:34,432
Hey, send money to me.

541
01:28:04,038 --> 01:28:05,505
When did you receive
the first call?

542
01:28:30,831 --> 01:28:33,698
Ok Alright then you and
your cameraman will remain..

543
01:28:33,834 --> 01:28:35,802
.. in custody until you come
out with the truth.

544
01:28:35,903 --> 01:28:37,666
He had called up at
around 2 pm and..

545
01:28:37,838 --> 01:28:40,238
.. he had asked me to come here.

546
01:28:40,841 --> 01:28:41,933
He had also said that
this would be..

547
01:28:42,076 --> 01:28:43,600
.. the most important day of my life.

548
02:12:16,919 --> 02:12:17,943
He is using you.

549
02:12:18,821 --> 02:12:23,258
He is watching our situation
and our panic Live on TV.

550
02:12:23,359 --> 02:12:24,826
You are his bloody eyes.

551
02:12:54,457 --> 02:12:58,484
Sir, he is around 50. Tall
man. Wears a spectacle.

552
02:12:58,594 --> 02:12:59,788
He looks like a clerk.

553
02:13:00,930 --> 02:13:02,227
There is an under
construction building..

554
02:13:02,332 --> 02:13:05,824
.. in Malad west behind Pritam
Nagar. Om constructions.

555
02:13:05,968 --> 02:13:07,799
I had delivered the
goods on the 12th floor.

556
02:13:07,937 --> 02:13:09,905
Vatkar! - Yes sir. - Take him away.

557
02:13:16,679 --> 02:13:18,874
Hello.Sir, this is Arif.
Yes I got it.

558
02:13:19,015 --> 02:13:20,414
There is an under construction
building in Malad.

559
02:13:21,884 --> 02:13:23,408
Patkar is bringing Rafiq
to the headquarters.

560
02:13:24,287 --> 02:13:25,879
Should I send Jai?
- There's no need.

561
02:13:26,622 --> 02:13:28,317
I will nab him and get
him to speak to you.

562
02:13:37,834 --> 02:13:38,858
What was your name again?

563
02:13:39,235 --> 02:13:40,259
Naina.

564
02:13:40,636 --> 02:13:43,070
Naina, I want you to do me a favour.

565
02:13:44,240 --> 02:13:47,266
Sir, until you don't tell me
everything I can't help you.

566
02:13:48,644 --> 02:13:51,340
Okay. Come here.

567
02:13:53,916 --> 02:13:56,476
This matter should be only
between you and me.

568
02:14:20,910 --> 02:14:23,310
Three. Two. One. Go.

569
02:14:24,280 --> 02:14:26,111
We have just received
information that..

570
02:14:26,315 --> 02:14:28,112
.. four terrorists whose
names are Ibrahim Khan..

571
02:14:28,284 --> 02:14:30,115
.. Iqlak Ahmed, Mohammad Zaheer
and Khursheed Lala..

572
02:14:30,286 --> 02:14:34,484
.. are being shifted to
some other location.

573
02:14:34,624 --> 02:14:36,455
The police says it is because
of security reasons.

574
02:14:36,559 --> 02:14:38,117
Right now we have Senior
inspector Jai Singh..

575
02:14:38,294 --> 02:14:40,125
.. who will give us full information
about this matter.

576
02:14:40,763 --> 02:14:44,028
What is the reason behind shifting
these four to some other location?

577
02:14:44,634 --> 02:14:46,898
There are some security reasons.
We have orders to do so.

578
02:14:47,303 --> 02:14:48,998
But why such an order?

579
02:14:49,472 --> 02:14:51,372
We have received orders to do so.

580
02:14:51,841 --> 02:14:53,502
Can you tell us whether there is
any threat to them and from whom?

581
02:14:53,643 --> 02:14:55,167
It is because of some
security reasons..

582
02:14:55,311 --> 02:14:58,075
.. that we have received
orders to shift them

583
02:14:59,315 --> 02:15:02,512
As you can see, the police is not
giving us any further information.

584
02:15:02,652 --> 02:15:05,143
And they are trying to
avoid our questions..

585
02:15:05,321 --> 02:15:07,289
.. by calling it a security reason.

586
02:15:07,657 --> 02:15:09,887
From Mumbai this is Naina Roy with
cameraman Raj for UTV news.

587
02:15:10,259 --> 02:15:11,283
Cut it!

588
02:15:15,598 --> 02:15:18,362
Sir, please don't do this again. My
wife watches the news channels.

589
02:15:18,468 --> 02:15:19,492
That was good Jai.

590
02:15:19,635 --> 02:15:20,659
Thank you Naina.

591
02:16:00,643 --> 02:16:03,168
Once again India approached America
with regards to Pakistan issue.

592
02:16:13,256 --> 02:16:18,694
The government is spending
crores of rupees to save..

593
02:16:18,828 --> 02:16:21,023
.. but due to legal reasons,
they are..

594
02:16:54,897 --> 02:16:58,389
Now, for the latest news let's move
to our correspondent Naina Roy..

595
02:17:05,908 --> 02:17:08,843
What is the reason behind shifting
these four to some other location?

596
02:17:09,478 --> 02:17:11,639
There are some security reasons.
We have orders to do so.

597
02:17:12,248 --> 02:17:13,806
But why such an order?

598
02:17:14,584 --> 02:17:15,744
We have received orders to do so.

599
02:17:32,201 --> 02:17:33,225
Arif, tell me.

600
02:17:33,336 --> 02:17:36,237
Sir, there is nobody here. But
he wanted us to come here.

601
02:17:36,339 --> 02:17:37,601
There are tags of 'Do
not disturb' in here.

602
02:17:39,208 --> 02:17:40,368
Come back.
- Yes sir.

603
02:17:41,611 --> 02:17:43,044
Jai
- Yes sir.

604
02:17:43,879 --> 02:17:46,040
We have to shift these four
terrorists to a single location.

605
02:17:46,649 --> 02:17:48,344
Start the process.
- Sir.
