1
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,399
On the count of three.

2
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:43,109
One, two, three!

3
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:47,558
Try the ring toss. Three for a quarter.
Look how easy it is.

4
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:49,915
There you go, a winner!

5
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:53,675
And now, for my shocking finale.

6
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:56,115
Not for the squeamish.

7
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:59,431
Not for the faint of heart.

8
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:04,278
I call my trick "The Jaws of Death. "

9
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:08,515
Now. Say it. Say it.

10
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:12,150
Harold, use your awesome might
to save me from this hopeless plight.

11
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:14,709
No harm will come to you.
Alakazam!

12
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:23,598
Help me! Help me!

13
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:37,512
I'm going to be an actress.

14
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:26,711
<i>Hard to believe it was last Christmas...</i>

15
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:28,711
<i>...that me and Harmony
changed the world.</i>

16
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:32,509
<i>And we didn't mean to.
And it didn't last long, you know.</i>

17
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:33,954
<i>A thing like that can't.</i>

18
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:37,795
<i>Now that I'm in L.A., I go to parties.
The kind where if a girl is named Jill...</i>

19
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:40,315
<i>...she spells it J-Y-L-L-E, that bullshit.</i>

20
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:45,038
<i>That's me there. My name's
Harry Lockhart, I'll be your narrator.</i>

21
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:46,519
<i>Welcome to L.A.</i>

22
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:47,954
<i>Welcome to the party.</i>

23
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:04,510
<i>The guy smoking, that's Dabney Shaw,
my producer. He discovered me.</i>

24
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:08,673
<i>The man with him is Perry Van Shrike,
a. k.a. Gay Perry.</i>

25
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:12,276
<i>Honest-to-God private eye,
consults in film, TV. Just incorporated.</i>

26
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:14,749
<i>He's bigtime. Also, he's gay.</i>

27
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:16,194
Don't start, Perry, huh?

28
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:19,238
I seen you play ball. You're tough.
But you see a naked guy...

29
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:20,992
...your brain says, "I want that. "

30
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:24,391
I don't make that leap. It's like,
"Look, there's an elephant. Quick...

31
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:27,279
...let's drain its blood
to paint my boathouse. "

32
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:30,273
It's just that that's not the first thing
you think of.

33
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:32,032
<i>L.A.</i>

34
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:35,033
<i>By now you may wonder
how I wound up here, or maybe not.</i>

35
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:38,158
<i>Maybe you wonder how Silly Putty
picks shit up from comic books.</i>

36
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:41,232
<i>Point is, I don't see another
goddamn narrator, so pipe down.</i>

37
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:44,119
<i>How did I get here? See for yourself.</i>

38
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:53,350
Chloe, just run the name by me
one more time...

39
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:55,351
...because I must be
missing something.

40
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:58,114
I'm going nuts.
I've been through the store three times.

41
00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:00,919
<i>Cyber Agent. C-Y-B-E-
Why don't you ask...</i>

42
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:03,640
<i>-... an employee or something?
-No, they're all busy.</i>

43
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:08,869
"Protocop, protector of man. "
Is that it? Protocop? He protects men.

44
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:12,077
<i>Uncle Harry, look around.
There are signs.</i>

45
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:16,870
<i>That show was cancelled two years ago.
Just ask-Wait, are they even open?</i>

46
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:19,793
Yeah, it's holiday hours. Look-
Get away from the window.

47
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:22,269
-I gotta go, but I'll find this.

48
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:27,511
-Great.
-Shit, Harry, that shit went wrong!

49
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:29,591
-Give me the gun!
-No. Give me the bullets!

50
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:31,637
Freeze!

51
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:35,789
-You gotta be fucking kidding me.
-We'll stand here and wait for the police.

52
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:39,350
Drop the gun. We didn't do anything.
We are not dangerous. Drop the gun.

53
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:42,318
-Hey, lady, gun is not loaded-
-Richie, no!

54
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:44,349
Richie!

55
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:46,193
Shit!

56
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:52,877
Oh, boy.

57
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:04,954
Take it easy.

58
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,117
Jesus. Oh, no, no.
We're not ready for you yet, sir.

59
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:12,272
-Go wait with the others.
-Grace, do me a favor, let's take him.

60
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:13,953
-He's ready. You're ready?
-Ready?

61
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:15,439
Okay, come on.

62
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:18,192
You know the setup?
Got any questions?

63
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:20,635
He's got no questions.
Look at him. Let's go.

64
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:22,074
Let's read.

65
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:27,834
-Where is he? Where's Raphael?
-Where is he?

66
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,274
Where's-?

67
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:38,029
Beat up on me all night. You want me
to give up my partner, you can go spit.

68
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:43,596
Quit acting like the good guy,
jerk-off.

69
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:45,318
You got your partner killed.

70
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:48,429
He was in over his head,
you knew it.

71
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:50,670
You may as well
have pulled the trigger.

72
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:52,319
You killed him!

73
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:58,916
No, I didn't-I didn't kill him.
He wanted in.

74
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:01,594
Why-?

75
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:03,991
Why?!

76
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:06,355
I didn't want him to come in on it.
He insisted.

77
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:11,230
I said, "Stay at home. " But he doesn't
listen. He's such a stupid son of a bitch.

78
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:13,193
I killed him, didn't I?

79
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:17,148
Oh, fuck, this is my fault. I'm sorry.

80
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:24,878
Sorry.

81
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:28,198
Hey, good luck.

82
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:32,153
See, this is what I'm talking about.
Old school. Method.

83
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:34,550
-Studio.
-Brando. Put this in the pouch to L.A.

84
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:35,994
Get Gay Perry on the phone.

85
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:39,597
<i>Now, get this, they're screen-testing me.
Is that wild?</i>

86
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:42,634
<i>One minute, I'm boosting Xboxes
in the East Village...</i>

87
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,995
<i>...the next,
I'm sipping champagne in L.A.</i>

88
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:46,912
-Hi.
-Hey.

89
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:48,433
So, what do you do?

90
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:51,068
I'm retired.
I invented dice when I was a kid.

91
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:55,439
-How about you?
-I do a little acting.

92
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:00,673
I'm gonna see who else is here.

93
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:02,956
<i>Anyway, that's how I got to the party.</i>

94
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:06,908
<i>Now, Harmony, different story.</i>

95
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:10,117
<i>Some will tell you she got here
on account of the giant robot.</i>

96
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:11,713
<i>I'll show you that in a minute.</i>

97
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:14,872
<i>But for me, robot-schmobot,
she was destined to be here.</i>

98
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:16,758
<i>Jeez, look at those stems, will you?</i>

99
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:19,878
<i>Not that that's what constitutes
why she should be here.</i>

100
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:21,758
Yes, racist. I'm serious.

101
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:25,310
The other reindeer laughed at him.
Then, out of the blue, they need him.

102
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:27,357
He's as good as a fog light
or whatever.

103
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:30,637
You know what, so you tell me,
how is it any different than:

104
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:32,916
"Don't talk to Reggie, he's black.

105
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:36,470
Oh, wait, he can play basketball.
Sign him up. "

106
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:38,915
Rudolph, Reggie.

107
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:43,437
<i>Harmony Faith Lane was your typical
L.A. girl, she wasn't from there.</i>

108
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:45,636
<i>She grew up in a burg
in southern Indiana.</i>

109
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:48,997
<i>"When in doubt, cut up a pig. "
That was the town motto.</i>

110
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:53,039
<i>Like most soon-to-be-fucked-up girls,
Harmony was wicked smart.</i>

111
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,997
<i>Of course, credit where credit's due...</i>

112
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:57,628
<i>...she had a terrific mentor.
No, not her.</i>

113
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:58,789
<i>Him.</i>

114
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:01,919
"'Go to hell, Jonny Gossamer!'

115
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:04,799
She poured herself
into a seamless dress.

116
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:07,394
From the looks of it,
she spilled some. "

117
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:09,835
<i>Jonny spoke from the pages
of cheap paperbacks...</i>

118
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,037
<i>...and told of a promised land
known as "the Coast"...</i>

119
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:17,159
<i>...and a magical city
called Los Angeles.</i>

120
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:20,756
<i>As the years progressed,
she wished he was real.</i>

121
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:25,357
<i>Wished that he would come to Indiana
to save her little sister, Jenna.</i>

122
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:29,988
<i>You see, Papa was at her
night after night.</i>

123
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:31,872
<i>But Jonny never showed.</i>

124
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:35,080
<i>And then the guy
writing the books died.</i>

125
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:36,878
<i>Age 16, she split.</i>

126
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:39,838
<i>Took the bus to L.A.,
the promised land.</i>

127
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,594
<i>She'd get rich and famous
and then help little sis.</i>

128
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:44,034
<i>Before he died...</i>

129
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:46,634
<i>...the guy who wrote the books
said Jonny was a joke.</i>

130
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:48,711
<i>He wrote it for money,
and it was bullshit.</i>

131
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:52,077
<i>Harmony ignored this. She knew better.
I mean, who the hell was he?</i>

132
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:53,994
<i>He was just a writer.</i>

133
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:56,594
<i>And that's how she got
to the same party as me-</i>

134
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:58,318
<i>Oh, shit. I skipped something.</i>

135
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:01,199
<i>Damn it. This robot bit.
I made a big deal, then I forgot.</i>

136
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:03,828
<i>Fuck, bad narrating.
Like my dad telling a joke.</i>

137
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,754
<i>"Oh, wait, back up. I forgot to tell you
the cowboy rode a blue horse. " Fuck.</i>

138
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:11,435
<i>I don't know if you want to see it now,
but here's the fucking robot stuff.</i>

139
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:12,874
<i>Can I say "fuck" more?</i>

140
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:15,474
<i>Now back to Protocop,

141
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:41,711
What the-?

00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:46,348
Oh, my God.

00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:16,477
<i>...where aspiring actress Harmony Faith
Lane was shocked to discover him.</i>

151
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:19,791
<i>I'd jog by, "Hi, hello, " you know,
that sort of thing.</i>

152
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:21,439
<i>-Who's this?
-I feel for the guy.</i>

153
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:23,875
<i>This city can't get enough
of messing with people.</i>

154
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:27,191
<i>Like putting a whoopee cushion
on the seat of an electric chair.</i>

155
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:29,191
<i>-Like that.
-They always do this.</i>

156
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:33,069
You can never see below the waist.
It's like a Playmate in 1964.

157
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:36,312
It was always behind the bedpost
or there's a shadow. You never-

158
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:39,074
What am I telling you for?
Invite her to something.

159
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:41,910
<i>And there it was. Bingo.</i>

160
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:44,991
<i>Destiny.</i>

161
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:48,440
You know what,
you better be her doctor.

162
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,831
Walk away. Don't think, just do it.

163
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,675
What, are you her brother or something?
It's none of your business, man.

164
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:58,913
-I will fuck you up.
-No, you'll try.

165
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:01,753
And that little experiment
will end in tears, my friend.

166
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:05,833
So again, for the cheap seats,
do not think, walk the fuck away.

167
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,036
Or let's you and me
go outside right now.

168
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:10,509
It's past my bedtime.

169
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:12,636
Make a choice.

170
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:29,716
Asshole.

171
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:35,152
You all right?

172
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:37,638
Yeah.

173
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:39,394
Thanks, bro.

174
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:41,790
One day,
I'll actually learn how to fight.

175
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:44,190
-Perry Van Shrike.
-Hey. Harry Lockhart.

176
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:49,234
I heard about you. You're
the whatchamacallit, the consultant.

177
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:52,597
-You must be-Anyway....
-Gay Perry?

178
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:55,672
Yeah. Right.
Dabney calls you that.

179
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:58,115
-I guess you guys are old buddies.
-Five years.

180
00:13:58,280 --> 00:14:00,350
Wow, five years.

181
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:01,919
-Still gay?
-Me? No.

182
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:06,676
I'm knee-deep in pussy. I just like the
name so much, I can't get rid of it.

183
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:11,598
You should know better than to fall
asleep at a party. There's freaks here.

184
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:15,871
Dabney wants you
to take detective lessons.

185
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:18,554
-Come again?
-For your acting.

186
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:20,551
I've got surveillance tomorrow.
You game?

187
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:22,392
What's the person like? Crime lord?

188
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:25,518
Please. I'm guessing some sad,
lonely little man...

189
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:28,717
...who single-handedly haunts his own
home in the Hollywood Hills.

190
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:31,110
That was incredibly gay.

191
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:34,397
-Good God. Ouch.
-Yeah, you should see the other guy.

192
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:37,677
Harry, this is our generous host,
Harlan Dexter.

193
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:42,152
Ah, yes, of course. You're Dabney's
golden boy from back East.

194
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:43,992
I hope it isn't past your bedtime.

195
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:46,469
No, sir. My mom used to say
I had the neon disease.

196
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:48,551
When the neon lights came on,
I woke up.

197
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:52,713
I'm afraid I'm similarly afflicted.
My daughter just lived 10 years in Paris.

198
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:56,316
She says it is heaven
for the vampire set.

199
00:14:57,640 --> 00:15:02,316
If you'll excuse me, apparently I'm
meant to help cut this monstrosity.

200
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:06,715
Mom's gone, so it's just him
and his born-again little bundle of joy.

201
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:08,836
-Born-again? That's precious.
-Isn't it?

202
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,594
Three months ago, she was suing him
over Mom's millions.

203
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:13,716
He called her a-Well, a bad word.

204
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:18,550
Cunt. Welcome to Hollywood.

205
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:21,314
<i>Okay, I apologize.</i>

206
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:24,836
<i>That is a terrible scene.
It's like, "Why was that in the movie?</i>

207
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,309
<i>Gee, you think maybe
it'll come back later, maybe?"</i>

208
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:30,313
<i>I hate that. A TV's on,
talking about the new power plant.</i>

209
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:32,152
<i>Wonder where the climax will happen.</i>

210
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:36,074
<i>Or that shot of the cook in
Hunt for Red October. Sorry.</i>

211
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:38,595
Hi, thank you for coming.

212
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:41,558
Hey, do you know that blond gal
who just left?

213
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:45,156
Oh, the one with the guy
that beat the shit out of you? No.

214
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:47,038
Bye, have a better night.

215
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:49,350
She had something, that gal,
this quality.

216
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:51,078
Like the girl from high school...

217
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:54,437
...the one that got away. You know
what I mean? That haunts you still.

218
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:56,477
-Yeah, I had that.
-You did?

219
00:15:56,640 --> 00:15:58,790
Bobby Mills.

220
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:02,710
Well, maybe you should
try to get in touch.

221
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:05,075
I got 5 bucks says
you could still get him.

222
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:08,391
Really? That's funny.
I got a 10 says, "Pass the pepper. "

223
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:11,199
I got two quarters harmonizing on
"Moonlight in Vermont. "

224
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:13,316
-What?
-Talking money.

225
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:15,550
-A talking monkey?
-Talking monkey, yeah.

226
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:18,917
Came here from the future.
Ugly sucker. Only says, "Ficus. "

227
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:21,952
Detective lessons tomorrow.

228
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:23,439
-Don't forget.
-Okay.

229
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:24,874
And Harry....

230
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:26,712
Come here.

231
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:29,189
That girl, I know her.
She's done some work for me.

232
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:31,917
Try the Domino Room.

233
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:33,672
Where's that?

234
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:52,913
-Hey there. I'm Flicka.
-Hey.

235
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:55,878
-How are you?
-Good. So, what do you do?

236
00:16:57,480 --> 00:17:00,711
-I'm a private detective. And you?
-I'm a stewardess.

237
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:02,598
-Really?
-Yeah.

238
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:04,830
-Well, nice to meet you.
-That it?

239
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,036
-Yeah.
-Yep.

240
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:16,593
Could I have a Jack and soda? Thanks.

241
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,514
Evening. Harry.

242
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:22,798
God, I'm sore.

243
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:27,033
I mean, physically, not like a guy
who's angry in a movie in the 1950s.

244
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:34,196
-Didn't I see you at a party hours ago?
-Why?

245
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:35,918
-Why what?
-Why me?

246
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:40,710
Seriously, why not the girl over there?
Look, she's very pretty.

247
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:42,154
Which one?

248
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:44,595
On the left,
next to Brazilian Billy Bob Thornton.

249
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:46,751
Oh, that's a bit of a reach.

250
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:49,354
I'm interrupting. I feel badly.
What are you drinking?

251
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:52,034
-Bad.
-Bad? Sorry?

252
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:53,792
-You feel bad.
-Bad?

253
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:57,191
"Badly" is an adverb. To say you
feel badly says that the mechanism...

254
00:17:57,360 --> 00:18:01,876
-...which allows you to feel is broken.
-Well, that one over there?

255
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:03,792
Between-Oh, God, nix, nix. That's-

256
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:07,239
-The blond. The blond's pathetic.
-Because?

257
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:11,916
For starters, she's been fucked
more times than she's had hot meals.

258
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:14,753
I heard. It was neck and neck,
and then she skipped lunch.

259
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:16,512
-Worst thing, though....
-Do tell.

260
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:19,513
Worst thing is she's 35 years old
and still trying to act.

261
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,389
I see her at auditions all the time.

262
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:25,599
-It's over, baby. You missed.
-That's charitable of you.

263
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:27,239
May I ask how old you are?

264
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:29,832
-Go for it.
-Okay, how old are you?

265
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,319
-Thirty-four.
-Yeah?

266
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:34,995
-I'm a baby.
-Where's your buddy? The guy you-

267
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:38,357
-The guy you left the party with?
-He's a fucking asshole.

268
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:40,476
I just needed a ride.
Sorry, I swear a lot.

269
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:42,551
-I know. It's okay.
-Did you know the host?

270
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:44,950
-No.
-He looked familiar, though.

271
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:46,997
Probably an actor.

272
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:50,114
Go away, Mr. Fly.

273
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:54,477
-I was talking to your friend.
-She doesn't want to talk to you.

274
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:57,029
Sunshine, she'll be back to you
in a minute. Relax.

275
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:58,997
She doesn't have a minute.

276
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,719
Tell you what, if you change your mind
about that drink...

277
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:08,031
...I'll be over there
with Native American Joe Pesci.

278
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,468
-You are so....
-That was good, right?

279
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:15,392
Why are you humoring him? Stop it.

280
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:18,279
You know what,
there's an empty table over there.

281
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:21,318
I hear it's a recommended
cheeseball hangout.

282
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:23,755
Your mouth is a recommended place
to put a sock.

283
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:26,388
Princess. Scary friend.

284
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:28,713
Goddamn it.

285
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:32,839
Harry Lockhart, are you gonna
recognize me or what?

286
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,150
God! Embrey, Indiana!

287
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:39,709
Loves snakes, afraid of spiders.

288
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:44,233
Come on, remember?
You were Amazing Harry-

289
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:46,789
-No, no, no. Harold the Great.
-Harmony?

290
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:48,279
You cut me in half, remember?

291
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:52,228
Oh, shit. Oh, my God. How are you?

292
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:54,470
<i>Okay, I was a bad narrator again...</i>

293
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:57,632
<i>...because the kid at the beginning,
the magician, that was me.</i>

294
00:19:57,800 --> 00:19:59,472
<i>I don't want to put this on you...</i>

295
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:02,473
<i>...but if you've been paying attention,
I shouldn't have to-</i>

296
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:04,915
<i>Great. No wonder. Ma and Pa Kettle.
I got an idea.</i>

297
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:08,595
<i>Why not put these two lame-o extras
in front of the mammoth fucking lens?</i>

298
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:10,751
<i>Boo. Scat. Fat lady, leave.</i>

299
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:13,115
<i>See there? "Harold. "</i>

300
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:15,794
<i>Remember how I said
this high school chick haunted me?</i>

301
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:17,916
<i>How seeing Harmony made me
think of her?</i>

302
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:20,469
<i>That's because it was her.
It all came flooding back.</i>

303
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:23,917
<i>How I was the one she confided in.</i>

304
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:26,833
<i>While she was doing every other guy.</i>

305
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:30,720
<i>It was the first time I felt
that how pitying someone...</i>

306
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:33,872
<i>...and wanting to fuck them
can get all tangled up in your head.</i>

307
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:36,349
<i>Overwhelming sadness.
Meanwhile, you got a rodney.</i>

308
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:40,274
<i>Is that sick? I think-
Yeah, I think that's sick.</i>

309
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:45,916
Leaving my sister back home,
leaving her there all alone....

310
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:50,388
Hardest thing I ever did.

311
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:56,834
Do you remember
when we were real little...

312
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,992
...and a movie crew came to town?

313
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:02,993
That mystery flick with the guy,
Jonny what's-his-name?

314
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:04,957
-Gossamer.
-Jonny Gossamer. Right.

315
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:08,157
Your mom went nuts,
and she bought all the books and stuff.

316
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:12,513
-That was-God, that was forever ago.
-Yeah, that was back in the day.

317
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:15,199
Harry...

318
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:18,356
...I didn't get famous.

319
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:21,992
Yet.

320
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:26,792
I did...

321
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:28,791
...get to do this one commercial.

322
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:31,235
You're shitting me. Which one?

323
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:33,789
Well, you know the one with the bear?

324
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:37,191
And it goes-Well, this is funny.

325
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:40,158
-"I prefer Genaros, but-"
-"But I'm a bear, what do I know?

326
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:42,072
I suck heads off fish. " That was you?

327
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:44,959
-Oh, my God.
-Yeah, it was. Yeah.

328
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:46,758
-That's awesome.
-Commercial.

329
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:48,353
Come on, that's a big deal.

330
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:50,511
-That's a national commercial.
-Harry, stop.

331
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:54,229
It's nothing. There was actually this
kind of cool moment where I got...

332
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:56,311
...to sort of do the wave.

333
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:00,553
"I prefer Genaros. "

334
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:02,915
-Whatever, it's nothing.
-It's pretty cool.

335
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:05,799
-It's nothing special at all.
-Well, I think it's special.

336
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:09,200
Punk-rock Steven Seagal
thinks it's special.

337
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:11,828
Right there, at your 11 o'clock.

338
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,433
That's dead-on, right?

339
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:16,273
That's all right.
I had him pegged when I came in.

340
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:20,948
Come back to the hotel for a little while,
just have one drink. Bring your friend.

341
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:24,908
It'd just be a drink. You'll be home faster
than you can say "Jack Robinson. "

342
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:27,196
I don't know about that. I can say...

343
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:31,950
-... "Jack Robinson" pretty fast.
-I'm timing you.

344
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:35,356
Jack Robinson.

345
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:05,439
-Do you have any idea what time it is?
-I'm really sorry.

346
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:08,194
God, you still look great.
You're just stunning. I like-

347
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:10,078
-Why are you here?
-Good question.

348
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:12,549
Sounds crazy, but I don't remember
what occurred...

349
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:14,631
...between the hours of 2 and 5,
a blur.

350
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:16,791
-Really? Where's Marleah?
-Marleah?

351
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:19,554
-The girl you....
-Marleah fell asleep at my place...

352
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:21,153
...and I didn't see you leave-

353
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:23,595
I left when you had your tongue
down her throat.

354
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:25,034
-I did?
-Yeah.

355
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:27,475
God. No, wrong throat, wrong woman.
That's bad.

356
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:29,790
Yeah, that's bad.
You got 10 seconds, Harry.

357
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:31,871
Oh, boy, pressure, pressure.
I came here...

358
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:34,429
...because I think
you're intelligent and attractive-

359
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:37,910
That's plenty. Stop. Oh, my God!
I can't believe you'd come here...

360
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:40,674
...to tell me you like me
after you fucked my friend!

361
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:43,195
That's just it, I didn't.
I believe that I did not.

362
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:44,998
What? You said you don't remember!

363
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:48,436
If I don't remember because I was drunk,
how could I have gotten it up?

364
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:50,511
I know this is outrageous
and not normal.

365
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:54,389
I'm not pretending that I'm normal.
I just chickened out-

366
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:58,469
Moron. Why? Why? Why?

367
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:30,190
And the plots, they all have this thing,
this formula that was so cool.

368
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:32,555
Seriously, I would go through one
in a day.

369
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:36,110
-A whole book in one day. Wow.
-See, Gossamer would always take on...

370
00:24:36,280 --> 00:24:38,350
...two cases
that were seemingly unrelated.

371
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:40,750
One's normal
and the other's some wild shit...

372
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:43,070
...then you'd find out
that they're connected.

373
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:45,151
That it's all one case.

374
00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:46,719
That's the essence of the-

375
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:51,112
Yeah, I get that all the time. Would
you mind not rooting around in there?

376
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:53,319
It's tiny. Is this real?

377
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:56,517
Yeah, it's a derringer. It's loaded.

378
00:24:56,960 --> 00:25:00,077
-I call it my faggot gun.
-Because?

379
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:04,153
It's only good for a couple shots, then
you gotta drop it for something better.

380
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:07,277
You asked, chief.

381
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:10,631
On with our lesson.

382
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:15,438
-My client is one Allison Ames. A-M-E-S.
-Ames.

383
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:18,672
Female. She hired me
to do some video surveillance.

384
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:20,353
-Is she a looker?
-Oh, man.

385
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:23,671
She opens the door,
she got nothing on but the radio.

386
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:26,111
Invites me to sit down,
sits on my lap...

387
00:25:26,280 --> 00:25:28,510
-...fires up a smoke.
-Really?

388
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:31,069
No. Idiot.

389
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:33,117
She hired me over the phone.

390
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:36,192
-Paid for it with a credit card.
-Okay.

391
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:41,673
Rule number one:
This business, real life, it's boring.

392
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:44,115
-Do you have to smoke?
-You want me to put it out?

393
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:48,273
Yeah, soon as you find a large, brown
clump of shrubs, just throw it in there.

394
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:52,069
So you knew Harmony in high school.
You said she dissed you.

395
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:54,549
No, not really.
She fucked every other guy but me.

396
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:56,836
No, that's not true.
She made one concession.

397
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,389
She agreed not to fuck my best friend,
Chook Chutney.

398
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:01,755
He was my best friend,
so she gave me that.

399
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:05,515
-Well, that was nice of her.
-Even if he asked, she said she wouldn't.

400
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:08,433
Stay put. Be quiet.

401
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:12,434
"Chook Chutney"? Yeah, he's gay.

402
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:30,715
-What's wrong with his car?
-Do I look like a mechanic?

403
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:35,194
-Are we gonna follow him?
-Where'd he go?

404
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:38,716
He was right in front of us,
then he cut in-Where is he?

405
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:45,676
What the hell. He's gotta be somewhere.
He turned right in front of us.

406
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:53,715
-Jesus!
-Shit!

407
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:55,313
Harry, come back.

408
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:56,799
Harry.

409
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:59,713
-There's no one in the car. Harry.
-What?

410
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:01,916
Harry, stop.

411
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:04,796
-I think it's going down.
-Wait, the sound.

412
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:06,996
-Check the back seat.
-No, get the keys!

413
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:09,276
The keys! Get the keys!

414
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:15,754
Perry.

415
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:19,437
Perry?

416
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:22,278
Shit.

417
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:27,431
Perry!

418
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:32,715
Where'd she come from?

419
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:36,190
She was in the trunk.
I had to shoot the lock to get it open.

420
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:37,634
Oh, Jesus.

421
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:41,071
God, what did they do to her face?

422
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:46,509
-Is she dead?
-No. She's resting her eyes for a minute.

423
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:48,875
Of course she's fucking dead.
Her neck's broken.

424
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:04,429
-Hey, what the hell's going on?
-Shut up.

425
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:07,755
-Hey, we got a dead girl here!
-Hey, shut up.

426
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:10,275
Two guys in masks,
and there they go.

427
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:12,237
What the fuck is going on?
This is bad.

428
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:14,197
We gotta roll before the cops come.

429
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:17,193
-Nix. We go right to the cops.
-Exactly, to the cops...

430
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:20,875
...who'll believe that she broke her neck
before you shot her in the head.

431
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:22,393
What?

432
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:24,755
-Come on, we gotta go.
-Oh, God.

433
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:27,275
-We gotta go. Go, go, go.
-Oh, God.

434
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:29,112
Oh, God.

435
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:32,078
-All right, we're out of here.
-We gotta go, go, go.

436
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:33,514
Where's my gun?

437
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:35,432
-No, I-
-Give me my gun.

438
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:37,033
-I got rid of it.
-Say again.

439
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:39,191
Threw it in the lake.
You wouldn't, I would.

440
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:41,920
I got priors in New York,
so I can't be messing around-

441
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:43,798
-You threw it away?
-It's evidence.

442
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:46,190
-Watch it. Relax.
-Okay, okay. No, I'm sorry.

443
00:28:46,360 --> 00:28:49,272
-I got a little nonplussed there.
-This is crazy. I understand.

444
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:52,075
-What is that? Is that a clue?
-What do you mean?

445
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:53,673
-Do you see that?
-In the thing?

446
00:28:54,520 --> 00:28:55,794
What were you thinking?

447
00:28:55,960 --> 00:28:58,952
My $2000 ceramic Vektor
my mother got me as a special gift...

448
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:02,317
...you threw next to the car.
What happens when they drag the lake?

449
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:04,072
You think they'll find my pistol?

450
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:07,676
Jesus. Look up "idiot" in the dictionary.
You know what you'll find?

451
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:09,353
-A picture of me?
-No...

452
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:12,830
...the definition of the word "idiot,"
which you fucking are.

453
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:16,471
Bitch client.

454
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:18,710
Hires me, has me witness a murder.

455
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:21,075
-Can I use a dry towel? This towel's wet.
-No.

456
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:23,390
-This towel is wet.
-The towel is for the seat.

457
00:29:23,560 --> 00:29:26,233
This was for your shoes.
You handed it to me for my face?

458
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:28,709
-This is wet. Can I use a dry-?
-It's dirty. No.

459
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:31,474
-Can I-?
-No. Stop dripping.

460
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:34,673
Shit better be improving your acting.

461
00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:47,838
-Get out.
-Sorry about the gun.

462
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,672
Whatever. Out.

463
00:29:50,280 --> 00:29:51,952
Go. Sleep badly.

464
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:54,711
Any questions, hesitate to call.

465
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:56,757
-Bad.
-Excuse me?

466
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:58,194
Sleep bad.

467
00:29:58,360 --> 00:30:01,238
Otherwise, it seems like
the mechanism that allows sleep-

468
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:04,790
What, fuckhead? "Badly" is an adverb.
Who taught you grammar? Out. Vanish.

469
00:30:07,560 --> 00:30:09,198
-I'll give you a buzz.
-Die.

470
00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:20,637
That's all right, don't apologize.

471
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:23,997
-Blow me. You forgot this.
-Oh, thanks.

472
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:26,916
<i>-Hello?
-I'm trying to locate Harry Lockhart.</i>

473
00:30:27,080 --> 00:30:28,752
<i>-Speaking.
-I'm detective Sgt. Kale.</i>

474
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:30,956
<i>Mind answering a question or two?</i>

475
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:33,111
Of course, no problem.
Fire away, officer.

476
00:30:33,280 --> 00:30:36,477
<i>Are you familiar with a woman
by the name of Harmony Faith Lane?</i>

477
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:37,914
Yeah, what's this-?

478
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:40,878
<i>Are you aware of giving your number
to Miss Lane recently?</i>

479
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:43,031
<i>-On a slip of paper, perhaps?
-No.</i>

480
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:46,078
<i>-Are you sure?
-Well, maybe she had my number. Why?</i>

481
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:49,915
<i>We're required by law to treat every
suicide as a potential homicide.</i>

482
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:52,116
<i>Harmony Lane shot herself, sir.</i>

483
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:54,669
<i>-Suicide?
-Yes-</i>

484
00:30:54,840 --> 00:30:56,273
Hello?

485
00:30:56,440 --> 00:30:58,158
Hello?

486
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:02,791
-I'll be goddamned.
-Jesus.

487
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:09,552
Don't blame yourself. Listen...

488
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:12,837
-...sometimes these things just happen-
-For a reason.

489
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,070
For a reason? Fuck that.

490
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:19,718
Why? Because I fall off a building,
10 people in Baltimore...

491
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:21,632
...survive a bus crash?

492
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:25,952
Swell, they're enjoying Baltimore.
I'm lying here with my brains out.

493
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:29,316
I've been to Baltimore, you win.

494
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:32,830
Listen...

495
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:37,836
-...I'm really sorry. I gotta go.
-Yeah.

496
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,911
I gotta go.

497
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:45,438
I have to go.

498
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:02,238
<i>Genaros. Pure drinking pleasure.</i>

499
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:05,278
<i>I prefer Genaros.
But what do I know? I'm a bear.</i>

500
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:08,193
<i>I suck the heads off fish.</i>

501
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:11,398
<i>Genaros.</i>

502
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:18,151
<i>I was tired. I was pissed. I was wetter
than Drew Barrymore at a grunge club.</i>

503
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:21,630
<i>I needed a hot bath, a warm bed.</i>

504
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:25,914
<i>But the night had other plans for me.</i>

505
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:28,036
<i>-Oh, you did?
-I got the Cyber Agent.</i>

506
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:30,998
<i>-You got the Cyber Agent.
-It has all the cool weapons.</i>

507
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:32,559
You got Protocop coming too.

508
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:36,315
It's gonna be worth more too
because I think he's, like, paralyzed now.

509
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,274
Son of a bitch!

510
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:43,558
<i>See, I forgot, old Jonny,
he always had two cases. Remember?</i>

511
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:45,233
How are you?

512
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:47,158
Hey.

513
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:51,031
She's gone, Harry.

514
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:53,839
-Yeah.
-She's gone.

515
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,958
I know. Who?

516
00:32:57,440 --> 00:33:00,318
Fact is, she stole not only
your credit card, but your ID.

517
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:02,909
We're very sorry about
the mix-up on our part.

518
00:33:03,080 --> 00:33:06,231
So are you willing to positively identify
this woman as your-

519
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:08,271
-My sister! Yes!
-Your sister was here?

520
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:10,436
Oh, God!
God, we haven't spoken in years.

521
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:13,034
She's never forgiven me
for leaving her all alone.

522
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:15,959
-I'm just gonna get you a blanket.
-I don't want a blanket!

523
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:17,758
-But you're shivering.
-I don't care!

524
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:19,996
You're freaking me out.
Will you relax, okay?

525
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:22,071
-Oh, God.
-I'm so glad that you're okay...

526
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:25,277
...but now, I don't know, you're
making me more nervous. Sit down.

527
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:26,793
-Okay.
-Tell me what happened.

528
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:30,316
Yesterday, Jenna,
she got into my house, Harry.

529
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:32,357
She must have been broke,
I don't know.

530
00:33:32,520 --> 00:33:35,830
She swiped 200 bucks, a credit card,
California ID, God knows what else.

531
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,831
-Right.
-Oh, God.

532
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,513
-No more lies, Harry.
-No.

533
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:41,199
No.

534
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:43,157
Are you a detective?

535
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:47,677
-Are you a detective?
-Who told you that?

536
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:50,440
Flicka. Flicka.
You know, my friend? She told me.

537
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:52,113
She told me you were a detective.

538
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:54,589
-If you are, then I really need your help.
-Well-

539
00:33:54,760 --> 00:33:56,352
That's empty, honey.

540
00:33:56,560 --> 00:34:01,111
Okay, I know this sounds crazy,
Harry, but listen. Okay. Okay.

541
00:34:01,320 --> 00:34:04,835
<i>-My sister's been living out here....
-Harmony's sister, dead. What the hell?</i>

542
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:08,276
<i>What was she even doing here?
The lady in the lake, now the sister.</i>

543
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:11,671
<i>This was two corpses in three hours.
Am I crazy? That's unusual, right?</i>

544
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:14,354
<i>Yeah, looking back,
I maybe should've told her...</i>

545
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:16,397
<i>...I wasn't really a nipple-Detective.</i>

546
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:19,990
<i>Detective. Sorry. I should've said
something, but she wouldn't shut up.</i>

547
00:34:20,160 --> 00:34:22,276
The card she stole from me
was maxed out.

548
00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:26,831
Right before she died, she charged over
$2000 on it. That's weird, isn't it?

549
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:30,749
Sentron something.
Some bullshit company! Plus-

550
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:34,157
Red flag, Harry. She took her
birth control pill for the day.

551
00:34:34,360 --> 00:34:36,396
Why would she even bother
with the pill, huh?

552
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:39,472
She was murdered, Harry.
She was murdered. She was murdered.

553
00:34:39,640 --> 00:34:42,154
Honey, all right.
Relax, relax, relax. Okay, relax.

554
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:43,912
Are you gonna help me, Harry?

555
00:34:44,120 --> 00:34:46,839
-I gotta check my schedule-
-If you're not gonna help me...

556
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,753
...I need to get out of here,
find someone that'll help me.

557
00:34:49,920 --> 00:34:52,275
-I just gotta check my schedule.
-Can you help me?

558
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:54,908
If you're not gonna help me,
I need to find somebody else!

559
00:34:55,080 --> 00:34:57,878
-My caseload is pretty-
-Oh, Harry, thank you.

560
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:28,070
Yuck, come on.

561
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:42,319
-It was nothing. I didn't do anything.
-What are you doing?

562
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:44,789
-I didn't do anything.
-You were grabbing my tit.

563
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:47,394
No, there was a spider.
There was a big spider.

564
00:35:47,560 --> 00:35:50,028
-Oh, please, whatever.
-I swear to God.

565
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:54,916
Look, I'll find it. I'll find the thing.
Where are you? Fuzzy little bitch.

566
00:35:55,120 --> 00:35:58,396
-Whatever. It's okay, I believe you.
-Clearly, you don't.

567
00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:01,837
Look, Harry, you grabbed my tit.
It's life, all right? It's no biggie.

568
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:07,399
No biggie? Guy grabs your tit,
"That's life, no biggie"?

569
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:10,512
I mean, what kind of talk is that?

570
00:36:10,680 --> 00:36:13,911
No, you tell me. What kind of talk
is that? I can't believe you.

571
00:36:14,080 --> 00:36:16,958
I can't believe that
that's the reaction that-

572
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:22,953
See there?

573
00:36:23,240 --> 00:36:24,719
Yeah.

574
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:28,390
-I trust you.
-Right.

575
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:32,115
What is your problem? I'm letting you
off the hook. You didn't do anything.

576
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:33,793
No, but you thought I did.

577
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:37,231
Do you get it? I'm on the hook. The hook
is my home. Do you understand?

578
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:41,673
Listen to me. I grab your tit,
it's a fucking biggie!

579
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:44,035
That came out wrong.
But what I'm saying is...

580
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:48,079
...you act like, "Oops, it's an okay lapse.
You know, everybody does it. "

581
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:51,075
What the fuck kind of guys
you hang out with here?

582
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:53,840
I mean, are you the kind of girl
who like, you know...?

583
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:55,911
Who what, Harry?

584
00:36:57,120 --> 00:36:58,712
Who what?

585
00:37:00,920 --> 00:37:02,592
Forget it.

586
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:05,430
I'm sorry, just relax.
Just get some rest, okay?

587
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:09,639
Okay, we'll start on your case
tomorrow. All right?

588
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:11,597
-Afternoon good?
-Whatever, Harry.

589
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:13,034
-I'm going.
-Okay.

590
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:16,431
-I'm taking some sweats, all right?
-Yeah, anything you want to borrow.

591
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:19,512
-I'll give them back.
-Yeah. Yeah, anything in the drawer.

592
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:21,557
If it's in the drawer, it's clean.

593
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:24,154
Night, Harry.

594
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:28,313
Harry?

595
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:31,318
This is....

596
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:34,392
-This is really great.
-Isn't it?

597
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:37,757
-I'm leaving.
-Yeah, some nice rest.

598
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:39,194
Bye.

599
00:37:39,720 --> 00:37:41,756
Fuck off-!

600
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:44,708
Say again? They gave her back?

601
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:47,718
Yes. She's in my shower.
I'm looking at her, for chrissake.

602
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:49,916
<i>That's impossible.
They don't even know you.</i>

603
00:37:50,080 --> 00:37:54,676
You're right. The body can't be here.
This is all a dream. There's Elmo the elf.

604
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:56,876
<i>-Shut up. How did they get in?
-I don't know.</i>

605
00:37:57,040 --> 00:37:59,110
How am I supposed to know?
Fire escape, maybe.

606
00:37:59,320 --> 00:38:02,915
Okay, first things first. We gotta move
her somewhere. You got gloves?

607
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:04,877
<i>-Excuse me?
-Gloves. Do you have gloves?</i>

608
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:08,953
You have to move her. If it's a frame-up,
some asshole's calling the cops on you.

609
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:11,839
<i>Do this: Wrap up the body
in a blanket, a sheet, anything.</i>

610
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:15,117
-Okay, any particular kind of gloves?
-Yes, fawn.

611
00:38:15,320 --> 00:38:16,719
<i>Will you fucking hurry?</i>

612
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:18,154
<i>-Perry?
-Yeah?</i>

613
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:20,311
-I peed on it.
-What? You peed on what?

614
00:38:20,520 --> 00:38:23,114
I peed on the corpse.
Can they do, like, an ID from that?

615
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:26,033
-I'm sorry, you peed on-?
-On the corpse. My question is-

616
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:27,832
No, my question. I get to go first.

617
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,275
Why in poo-perfect hell
would you pee on a corpse?

618
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:32,198
It's not like I did it for kicks.

619
00:38:32,360 --> 00:38:34,999
You said this doesn't happen.
This is your fault!

620
00:38:35,160 --> 00:38:38,277
Shut up and listen.
First, we have to wrap the body.

621
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:40,158
<i>Second, you've got to find the gun.</i>

622
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:43,079
<i>-Say this with me, "Find the gun. "
-Find the gun.</i>

623
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:44,872
Damn it, I threw it in the lake.

624
00:38:45,080 --> 00:38:48,117
Not my gun, idiot. They dropped
the body on you, it's a frame-up.

625
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:50,874
Then they also have planted a gun,
trust me. Move it.

626
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:53,270
I'll be there in four minutes.

627
00:39:10,840 --> 00:39:16,836
Caller specified room 714, some sort of
brawl or something. Violent.

628
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:19,992
Yeah, 714. Lockhart.

629
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:23,596
-Let me get you the key.
-Actually, it's not 714, it's 514.

630
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:26,069
I was just up there,
and it's really noisy.

631
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:29,152
-Let's get the key.
-Yep, pretty awful.

632
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,434
-Don't answer that.
-Yeah, duh.

633
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:44,711
-That it?
-No, that's the corpse...

634
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:46,711
...from the last guy who stayed here.

635
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:48,154
Fuck off. Was there a gun?

636
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:51,198
Yeah, it's right here. Perry,
sons of bitches made us, made me.

637
00:39:51,360 --> 00:39:54,397
I'm in town for two days, they know
who I am and where to find me.

638
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:58,235
-That's impossible.
-Yeah, it's totally nuts. Back stairway.

639
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:03,190
I forgot to tell you, Harmony's alive.
She thinks her sister was murdered.

640
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:05,112
-Come again?
-Never mind.

641
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:23,118
See, these dudes tonight,
they see two assholes out of nowhere.

642
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:25,589
-What do they think?
-They think we know something.

643
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:28,872
They panic. They got a body,
they've gotta dispose of the evidence.

644
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:30,871
In my shower?
Come on, you said real life.

645
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:35,192
-They were setting you up, dummy.
-They're not setting me up. Shut up.

646
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:37,510
You change your tune
every five minutes.

647
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:39,875
-Kiss me.
-What? No, no, no.

648
00:40:43,240 --> 00:40:46,232
Check out Doris and Lucinda
over here.

649
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:54,954
These lessons suck.

650
00:40:55,160 --> 00:40:58,232
I quit. This is not being a detective.
Corpses floating in lakes...

651
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:02,279
...people kissing people. This is wrong.
This is every shade of wrong.

652
00:41:02,440 --> 00:41:04,510
Somebody wanna fill me in?

653
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:07,955
She thinks I'm a detective,
so go along with it.

654
00:41:08,120 --> 00:41:09,473
-What?
-Don't fuck me up.

655
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,036
Hey.

656
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:14,993
Do you know the cops
are looking for you, Harry?

657
00:41:15,160 --> 00:41:16,434
-They are?
-Yeah.

658
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:19,478
I sent them to the wrong room.
I didn't know what else to do.

659
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:22,069
You did fine.
Perry and I, we're just-

660
00:41:22,280 --> 00:41:24,714
-Hiya, Perry.
-We're just running, you know, a game.

661
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:26,518
Perry, what do you call it?

662
00:41:26,680 --> 00:41:30,878
The old Bring Them In and Push
Them Out. That's what we're doing.

663
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:32,314
What's going on?

664
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:35,278
Why are you and Perry nacking
on each other?

665
00:41:38,840 --> 00:41:42,355
<i>I sent her home believing, A, we'd meet
tomorrow to go over her case...</i>

666
00:41:42,520 --> 00:41:44,590
<i>...and, B, I wasn't actually gay.</i>

667
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:46,995
<i>Do not ask me how I did B.</i>

668
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:49,197
Why didn't we just leave it there?

669
00:41:49,360 --> 00:41:51,555
Think, dummy.
A 911 call from your hotel room...

670
00:41:51,720 --> 00:41:54,280
...all of a sudden,
there's a corpse outside? Bad idea.

671
00:41:54,440 --> 00:41:57,750
Speaking of bad ideas, what's this
about you taking on your own case?

672
00:41:57,920 --> 00:41:59,956
Of all the dipshit things to do.

673
00:42:00,120 --> 00:42:01,599
Killed herself, by the way.

674
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:03,711
Killed herself.
I solved your case for you.

675
00:42:03,880 --> 00:42:06,758
-Harmony's convinced-
-I don't care about-Listen to me.

676
00:42:06,920 --> 00:42:10,071
-Little sis punched her own ticket.
-Okay. Gotcha.

677
00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:13,437
All right, this looks good up ahead.
Time to lose the luggage.

678
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:22,638
Sorry, sweetheart.

679
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:24,677
You deserved better.

680
00:42:35,160 --> 00:42:37,071
Before I left,
I got her into foster care.

681
00:42:37,240 --> 00:42:40,755
I've never told you just how awful he
treated her. My dad, I'm talking about.

682
00:42:40,920 --> 00:42:43,718
I'll tell you what,
I take notes, in general...

683
00:42:43,880 --> 00:42:48,271
...so if you're just real specific,
thorough and precise, that'll help.

684
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:51,313
I remember only lying to her one time.

685
00:42:51,480 --> 00:42:52,833
I said to her:

686
00:42:53,040 --> 00:42:55,952
"Maybe the man who is living here
is not your father. "

687
00:42:56,160 --> 00:42:58,754
You told your sister
she was adopted, yeah?

688
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:01,079
No, I did one better.

689
00:43:01,240 --> 00:43:03,196
I told her her real father
was an actor...

690
00:43:03,360 --> 00:43:05,794
...who was in the movie
that came through town.

691
00:43:05,960 --> 00:43:08,599
-Jonny Gossamer-
-Jonny Gossamer movie. That's right.

692
00:43:09,320 --> 00:43:11,550
I told Jenna one day she'd go
to Hollywood...

693
00:43:11,720 --> 00:43:14,473
...and she'd meet her famous,
real father.

694
00:43:26,840 --> 00:43:29,673
She believed me, Harry,
and she came out here looking for him.

695
00:43:29,840 --> 00:43:32,912
Okay, this is a bunch.
I can start my...

696
00:43:33,240 --> 00:43:35,435
-...process, I guess.
-Thank you.

697
00:43:35,640 --> 00:43:38,438
I'm on the case. Here is my card.

698
00:43:40,080 --> 00:43:42,674
-It's a magic card, so....
-Wow, "the Amazing Harold. "

699
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:45,792
-Just say "abracadabra. "
-What happened, somebody sue you?

700
00:43:46,360 --> 00:43:48,749
It used to be "alakazam"
when you cut me in half.

701
00:43:48,920 --> 00:43:51,434
And, not to be picky,
but it was "Harold the Great. "

702
00:43:51,600 --> 00:43:55,115
No, I used to be great,
now I'm amazing. Get with it.

703
00:43:56,480 --> 00:43:58,630
<i>Hi, it's me. You hear anything?</i>

704
00:43:58,840 --> 00:44:00,671
No, there's nothing
in the papers, so....

705
00:44:00,840 --> 00:44:03,400
I'm busy working on Harmony's case.

706
00:44:03,600 --> 00:44:04,919
<i>What case? Leave her alone.</i>

707
00:44:05,120 --> 00:44:08,192
<i>News on Channel 5, just starting.
Call me after.</i>

708
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:11,753
<i>-a kidnapping gone wrong.
It is unclear why his daughter...</i>

709
00:44:11,920 --> 00:44:13,751
<i>...was subsequently murdered
or where...</i>

710
00:44:13,960 --> 00:44:17,509
<i>...for she was almost certainly killed
and then moved, police sources say.</i>

711
00:44:17,680 --> 00:44:20,399
<i>Veronica Dexter was reported missing
yesterday afternoon...</i>

712
00:44:20,560 --> 00:44:23,154
<i>...when she failed to greet
her boyfriend at the airport.</i>

713
00:44:23,320 --> 00:44:26,392
<i>Miss Dexter recently made headlines
when she returned from Paris...</i>

714
00:44:26,560 --> 00:44:29,757
<i>...and withdrew her multimillion-dollar
lawsuit against her father...</i>

715
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:32,514
<i>...actor-turned-entrepreneur
Harlan Dexter.</i>

716
00:44:32,680 --> 00:44:34,750
<i>Mr. Dexter owns
the prestigious Dexter Clinic.</i>

717
00:44:34,920 --> 00:44:38,356
<i>His wife died last spring,
prompting Veronica's return to the U.S...</i>

718
00:44:38,520 --> 00:44:42,149
<i>...and a father-daughter reconciliation
following years of estrangement.</i>

719
00:44:42,360 --> 00:44:46,433
<i>Veronica Dexter,
25 years old yesterday. Paul.</i>

720
00:44:46,760 --> 00:44:48,876
We were just at that party.
Are you telling me...

721
00:44:49,040 --> 00:44:51,554
...that the girl in the lake,
that was Veronica Dexter?

722
00:44:51,720 --> 00:44:53,438
Positive ID, scars, dental records.

723
00:44:53,600 --> 00:44:56,114
-You talked to your police guy?
-Yeah, not much there.

724
00:44:56,280 --> 00:44:59,033
The lab report came back,
no sign of rape.

725
00:44:59,520 --> 00:45:00,839
Boils down to this:

726
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:04,788
Veronica Dexter, yesterday afternoon
about 4:30, left her home.

727
00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:08,509
Went off to the airport, pick up
some dude, old boyfriend. Off she went.

728
00:45:08,680 --> 00:45:12,116
-That was the last anybody saw of her?
-With a symmetrical, ungooshed head.

729
00:45:12,280 --> 00:45:13,713
Police ever find the car?

730
00:45:13,880 --> 00:45:15,916
No, genius, that was us. Remember?

731
00:45:16,120 --> 00:45:17,519
Oh, yeah, right.

732
00:45:17,960 --> 00:45:20,428
-The killers were at the party, Harry.
-They were?

733
00:45:20,600 --> 00:45:23,672
-The killers were at Dexter's?
-That's how they recognized you.

734
00:45:23,880 --> 00:45:26,917
It's getting too scary. You gotta bail.
Get a flight out, today.

735
00:45:27,080 --> 00:45:30,072
But I got my screen test Tuesday.
I'll go Wednesday.

736
00:45:30,240 --> 00:45:32,993
-You're not getting the part.
-Fuck off. Don't be a schmuck.

737
00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:35,794
-I know it's a long shot.
-You're not gonna get the part.

738
00:45:35,960 --> 00:45:38,428
You're not listening to me.
You won't get the-Harry!

739
00:45:38,600 --> 00:45:43,151
You're not gonna get the part, okay?
Colin Farrell wants too much money.

740
00:45:43,320 --> 00:45:44,799
Do you get me now?

741
00:45:45,600 --> 00:45:49,036
Dabney, he unearths a discovery.
New kid, works for cheap.

742
00:45:49,240 --> 00:45:51,549
Flies him out here,
high profile, parties...

743
00:45:51,760 --> 00:45:54,638
...screen tests,
detective lessons, all of it.

744
00:45:54,840 --> 00:45:56,114
You were just being used.

745
00:45:56,280 --> 00:45:58,840
Shave a couple million
off of Colin Farrell's price tag.

746
00:46:00,680 --> 00:46:02,875
Sorry, chief. There it is.

747
00:46:03,560 --> 00:46:05,073
I'm not gonna lie to you anymore.

748
00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:10,432
I understand if you wanna
take a swing at me. You fuck!

749
00:46:10,640 --> 00:46:12,278
You sissy bitch!

750
00:46:12,480 --> 00:46:13,754
Stop.

751
00:46:13,920 --> 00:46:15,956
Don't bother asking Harmony out
on your date.

752
00:46:16,120 --> 00:46:20,750
She wasn't very happy to find out that
you're not a detective, that you lied.

753
00:46:20,920 --> 00:46:22,717
-You told her?
-Pick those up.

754
00:46:22,920 --> 00:46:24,478
Pick them up.

755
00:46:25,560 --> 00:46:27,869
Why did you tell her?
You didn't have to tell her.

756
00:46:28,080 --> 00:46:30,913
-I am an idiot. I thought we were friends.
-We're not friends.

757
00:46:31,080 --> 00:46:34,356
-I was in trouble, you were there for me.
-No, I was-Stop speaking.

758
00:46:34,560 --> 00:46:37,199
I was there protecting
my employer, Dabney. Hello.

759
00:46:37,400 --> 00:46:39,470
He pays me to insulate him
from corpses.

760
00:46:44,960 --> 00:46:47,349
I'm not a nice man, Harry.

761
00:46:47,520 --> 00:46:49,875
Go home before something bad
happens to you.

762
00:46:50,080 --> 00:46:52,310
-What, are you threatening me?
-No, moron.

763
00:46:52,480 --> 00:46:54,948
Go home before the bad guys
do something bad to you.

764
00:46:55,120 --> 00:46:56,951
Right, I get it. Fine.

765
00:46:57,920 --> 00:46:59,751
Merry Christmas.
Sorry I fucked you over.

766
00:46:59,920 --> 00:47:02,957
No problem. Don't quit your gay job.

767
00:47:14,760 --> 00:47:17,752
<i>Arriving passengers

768
00:47:17,960 --> 00:47:20,394
<i>...may retrieve their baggage
at carousel two.</i>

769
00:47:25,160 --> 00:47:28,118
Hey, Flicka. Hey, it's me, Harry.

770
00:47:28,280 --> 00:47:30,316
Remember me?
What's up, honey? How are you?

771
00:47:30,480 --> 00:47:32,914
-She doesn't want to talk to you.
-Oh, no, no. I know.

772
00:47:33,080 --> 00:47:35,469
Did you ever think maybe
I don't want to talk to her?

773
00:47:35,640 --> 00:47:37,835
I just saw your really distinctive ears.

774
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:40,116
You look different,
but it's obviously Flicka.

775
00:47:40,280 --> 00:47:42,510
-Maybe it's you I'm interested in.
-Is that true?

776
00:47:42,680 --> 00:47:45,513
Not really. Look, she must have
a cell phone, right? She must.

777
00:47:45,680 --> 00:47:49,116
-Forget it. This is between you two.
-Look, I got a ticket. I am leaving.

778
00:47:49,280 --> 00:47:51,953
I'm going back to the East Coast,
and that's-

779
00:47:52,120 --> 00:47:54,793
No? Come on,
I just want to say something to her.

780
00:47:54,960 --> 00:47:58,589
Just anything before I split.
I'm begging you. Come on, help me out.

781
00:47:58,760 --> 00:48:00,671
-I'm gonna regret this.
-No, you're not...

782
00:48:00,840 --> 00:48:03,400
...and that is a very smart suit,
by the way.

783
00:48:05,400 --> 00:48:07,789
-It's not here, that's funny.
-What's funny?

784
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:09,797
Nothing.
It's just under her stage name.

785
00:48:09,960 --> 00:48:13,236
Oh, God. Everyone's got a stage name.
What's her stage name?

786
00:48:13,400 --> 00:48:16,073
Ames. Allison Ames.

787
00:48:16,240 --> 00:48:18,356
Okay, well, I'll just write it down
and then-

788
00:48:18,520 --> 00:48:20,556
Hey! Say that name again.

789
00:48:20,760 --> 00:48:23,638
-Allison Ames.
-Allison Ames. A-M-E-S.

790
00:48:23,800 --> 00:48:25,756
-That's her stage name.
-I just said that.

791
00:48:25,920 --> 00:48:27,558
That's the name on her credit cards.

792
00:48:27,720 --> 00:48:31,190
-How am I supposed to know?
-Fuck! Thanks, honey. Gotta roll.

793
00:48:31,360 --> 00:48:32,952
Later.

794
00:48:33,400 --> 00:48:37,712
<i>You have reached the offices
of Sentron, Inc. Leave a message.</i>

795
00:48:38,240 --> 00:48:41,073
Newsflash, Perry. Your client, Ames,
it was the little sister.

796
00:48:41,240 --> 00:48:42,912
Repeat, the little sister.

797
00:48:43,080 --> 00:48:44,911
That's where Harmony's
2 grand went.

798
00:48:45,080 --> 00:48:47,196
It's in your bank,
you overpriced bastard.

799
00:48:47,360 --> 00:48:49,032
Her kid sister hired you.

800
00:48:49,200 --> 00:48:54,593
Do you get this? Your case and my case
are the same fucking case.

801
00:48:55,120 --> 00:48:57,190
-Come on!
-Get out of my life!

802
00:48:57,400 --> 00:49:00,915
I'm at the airport, right,
and I run into Flicka, and she says-

803
00:49:02,080 --> 00:49:04,435
-Did I just cut off your finger?
-Yeah.

804
00:49:04,600 --> 00:49:09,037
It's on the floor, to my periph-I don't
wanna see it. Pick it up, put it on ice.

805
00:49:09,320 --> 00:49:10,799
Thanks.

806
00:49:16,520 --> 00:49:18,317
<i>You're a genius, Harry.
You're a genius.</i>

807
00:49:18,480 --> 00:49:21,711
<i>Oh, my God, I'm so sorry I had to bail
on you, but I had to go to work.</i>

808
00:49:21,880 --> 00:49:24,394
<i>I am going nuts here.
I can't stop thinking about this.</i>

809
00:49:24,560 --> 00:49:27,074
<i>What's my sister's connection
to Veronica Dexter?</i>

810
00:49:27,240 --> 00:49:30,869
<i>She predicted that murder, Harry. She
sent you and Perry to that exact spot.</i>

811
00:49:31,040 --> 00:49:34,999
That whole thing is wild. You know what
else is nuts? You cut off my finger!

812
00:49:35,200 --> 00:49:39,079
Oh, God, Harry,
I am so sorry about that. How is it?

813
00:49:39,280 --> 00:49:41,874
It's fine. It's all shut up.
They gave me painkillers.

814
00:49:42,040 --> 00:49:44,759
<i>-Where's Perry? We gotta find him.
-Perry's coming by here.</i>

815
00:49:44,960 --> 00:49:46,598
I'm working a party on Sunset Plaza.

816
00:49:46,760 --> 00:49:49,957
Remember you said the killer may have
been at Dexter's party?

817
00:49:50,120 --> 00:49:53,954
<i>-Well, that whole bunch is here tonight.
-Honey, put me on the list, I'll drop by.</i>

818
00:49:54,120 --> 00:49:58,238
I'll see if I can stir up the kettle, stick
out my hat, see if anyone shoots at it.

819
00:49:58,400 --> 00:50:00,391
Maybe you could put the hat
in the kettle...

820
00:50:00,560 --> 00:50:04,155
...and if they shoot at it, it'll ricochet.
Harry, you sound trashed.

821
00:50:04,320 --> 00:50:06,038
Give me the address. I'm coming.

822
00:50:08,360 --> 00:50:10,590
<i>I showed up mildly whacked
on Demerol...</i>

823
00:50:10,760 --> 00:50:13,433
<i>...thinking Harmony's theory
wasn't so crazy.</i>

824
00:50:13,600 --> 00:50:14,874
Hi.

825
00:50:15,040 --> 00:50:17,759
<i>What if little sis had been murdered
by the same assholes...</i>

826
00:50:17,920 --> 00:50:19,319
<i>...who offed Veronica Dexter?</i>

827
00:50:19,480 --> 00:50:21,436
<i>Remember?
With the ski masks, those dudes.</i>

828
00:50:21,600 --> 00:50:23,272
<i>Then and there, I made a decision.</i>

829
00:50:23,440 --> 00:50:26,591
<i>If it fucking killed me,
I would not stop...</i>

830
00:50:26,800 --> 00:50:29,234
<i>...until I got, like, two more Demerol.</i>

831
00:50:29,400 --> 00:50:34,190
<i>No, seriously, I was on the case.
Harry Lockhart, L.A.P.I.</i>

832
00:50:52,120 --> 00:50:53,678
-I got it.
-What do you got?

833
00:50:53,840 --> 00:50:56,798
Just now. My friend Tiff
does the video dubbing at Fox.

834
00:50:58,280 --> 00:51:01,238
<i>-"Lord of the Cock Rings. "
-No, Harry, it's a fake label.</i>

835
00:51:01,400 --> 00:51:04,836
Copyright infringement, she'd get fired.
It's a Jonny Gossamer movie.

836
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:08,959
If Jenna was hunting her mystery dad,
this is where she would start, right?

837
00:51:09,120 --> 00:51:10,997
-Jesus, don't patronize me!
-I'm not.

838
00:51:11,160 --> 00:51:14,709
-You're patronizing me.
-No, I'm not. It's just a funny little buzz.

839
00:51:14,920 --> 00:51:17,309
I don't know if this guy's
your boyfriend or not...

840
00:51:17,480 --> 00:51:20,278
...but when you were in the bathroom,
he was checking me out.

841
00:51:20,480 --> 00:51:24,598
What? What is it out here
with these women?

842
00:51:24,760 --> 00:51:27,035
Please, they're no different
from anywhere else.

843
00:51:27,200 --> 00:51:30,829
They are. These are damaged goods,
every one of them, from way back.

844
00:51:31,040 --> 00:51:34,237
Take a guy who sleeps with 100 women
a year, go into his childhood...

845
00:51:34,400 --> 00:51:36,914
...dollars to doughnuts,
it's relatively unspectacular.

846
00:51:37,080 --> 00:51:40,390
Now, you take one of these gals
who sleeps with 100 guys a year...

847
00:51:40,560 --> 00:51:43,074
...and I bet you
if you look in their childhood...

848
00:51:43,240 --> 00:51:45,196
...there's something rotten in Denver.

849
00:51:45,360 --> 00:51:47,351
-Denmark.
-That too. But it's abandonment...

850
00:51:47,520 --> 00:51:50,353
...it's abuse. It's, "My uncle
put his ping-ping in my papa. "

851
00:51:50,520 --> 00:51:51,794
Then they all come out here.

852
00:51:51,960 --> 00:51:54,872
It's like someone took America
by the East Coast and shook it...

853
00:51:55,040 --> 00:51:57,156
...and all the normal girls
managed to hang on.

854
00:51:57,320 --> 00:52:01,074
Okay, everybody who hates Harry
here raise their hand.

855
00:52:02,160 --> 00:52:05,835
-See that? Obedient little bitches too.
-Fuck you!

856
00:52:06,040 --> 00:52:07,393
Hey.

857
00:52:07,560 --> 00:52:11,030
Okay, you've got 30 of my
fucking seconds, thrill me.

858
00:52:12,960 --> 00:52:14,234
All right, guys, cast list.

859
00:52:14,400 --> 00:52:16,994
Catch. That's the credit card
my sister used to hire you.

860
00:52:18,360 --> 00:52:20,271
So who's in this cinematic milestone?

861
00:52:20,440 --> 00:52:25,070
<i>-We got a Michael Beck, whoever that is.
-He's the star of Xanadu, with...</i>

862
00:52:25,240 --> 00:52:27,595
-...Olivia Newton-John and Gene Kelly.
-Gay.

863
00:52:28,680 --> 00:52:29,954
-What?
-Nothing.

864
00:52:30,120 --> 00:52:33,317
Perry, listen up. I know this is
a long shot, but indulge me, please.

865
00:52:33,480 --> 00:52:35,755
We gotta lose the hat.
I'm sorry, honey, I can't-

866
00:52:35,920 --> 00:52:38,070
-God, I'm working!
-I know, but just forget it.

867
00:52:38,240 --> 00:52:41,835
Seriously, don't jump all over me.
Just pay attention. Watch it, please.

868
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:43,399
-That's Harlan Dexter.
-What?

869
00:52:43,560 --> 00:52:45,710
-Who's Har-? What?
-Look, that's-

870
00:52:45,920 --> 00:52:48,434
He's 20 years younger,
but that's Harlan Dexter.

871
00:52:48,600 --> 00:52:50,750
<i>Always sees the inside of a police van.</i>

872
00:52:52,400 --> 00:52:53,674
No way.

873
00:52:55,520 --> 00:52:58,512
This kind of makes sense. He had
the Gossamer books at his house.

874
00:52:58,720 --> 00:52:59,994
Used to be an actor.

875
00:53:00,200 --> 00:53:03,476
I remember him now. 1980.
Oh, my God, I saw him like this.

876
00:53:03,680 --> 00:53:05,511
-Young.
-Where?

877
00:53:05,720 --> 00:53:08,109
In Indiana. He was there
with the movie crew.

878
00:53:08,280 --> 00:53:12,239
Remember, I told you he looked familiar.
Oh, God, this can't be true.

879
00:53:12,720 --> 00:53:16,793
And your sister has to have seen this,
so you know what it comes down to.

880
00:53:16,960 --> 00:53:19,679
You tell your sister a fairy tale
about her real father-

881
00:53:19,840 --> 00:53:23,230
And 20 years later, she comes out
to L.A. hunting Harlan Dexter.

882
00:53:26,400 --> 00:53:29,073
I've got a surveillance
in MacArthur Park.

883
00:53:29,240 --> 00:53:32,835
I gotta follow some chick around
till midnight. Do not play detective.

884
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:34,991
This is not a book. This is not a movie.

885
00:53:35,160 --> 00:53:36,878
We got it. Do you think I'm stupid?

886
00:53:37,040 --> 00:53:39,031
You wouldn't know where
to feed yourself...

887
00:53:39,200 --> 00:53:43,910
...if you didn't flap your mouth so much.
Yes, I think you're stupid.

888
00:53:44,800 --> 00:53:48,429
Harry, don't listen to a word he says,
all right? We're getting somewhere.

889
00:53:48,640 --> 00:53:50,870
I'll call you tomorrow.
I'm going back to work.

890
00:53:51,040 --> 00:53:51,916
Good.

891
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:10,673
-Excuse me.
-What's up, baby? How you feeling?

892
00:54:10,880 --> 00:54:13,440
-I'm just gonna-
-Come and take a walk. Walk with me.

893
00:54:13,600 --> 00:54:15,670
Great, this is fucking rich.

894
00:54:17,320 --> 00:54:19,880
Well, now, here we all are:

895
00:54:20,040 --> 00:54:23,749
-Ike, Mike and Mustard.
-What the hell does that mean?

896
00:54:23,960 --> 00:54:26,679
I'm with him on this one.
That's pretty fucking obscure.

897
00:54:26,840 --> 00:54:28,637
-I hear that all the time.
-You do?

898
00:54:28,800 --> 00:54:30,916
-Yeah, sure.
-Where? At the 1942 Club?

899
00:54:31,080 --> 00:54:34,914
-Just because you didn't get it-
-Motherfucker, I could-Slow your roll.

900
00:54:35,120 --> 00:54:38,271
This is bullshit. What will you do,
take me out here? There's sec-

901
00:54:38,480 --> 00:54:41,358
-Keep talking. Keep talking.
-You wanna know who we are?

902
00:54:41,560 --> 00:54:44,199
I'm the frying pan, see?
And my boy over here-

903
00:54:44,360 --> 00:54:46,828
He's Mustard.
I'm Mustard, baby.

904
00:54:47,040 --> 00:54:48,314
-Sure.
-He's the fire.

905
00:54:48,520 --> 00:54:51,478
-Fuck you, Mr. Mustard.
-Here we go.

906
00:54:51,680 --> 00:54:54,797
Now, me and my man, we're puzzled
lately by your behavior, such as-

907
00:54:54,960 --> 00:55:00,512
Such as why is a savvy, stand-up cat
like yourself consorting with gay men?

908
00:55:01,760 --> 00:55:04,035
Frolicking in the lake together.
What is that?

909
00:55:04,200 --> 00:55:06,350
You're the guys
who were wearing the masks.

910
00:55:06,560 --> 00:55:09,677
-You don't ask the questions.
-Don't ask questions.

911
00:55:09,840 --> 00:55:13,037
God, you just tore up my fucking
finger! I just got this fixed. Jesus!

912
00:55:13,200 --> 00:55:15,998
I bet there's a doctor in New York,
clear that shit right up.

913
00:55:16,160 --> 00:55:17,673
Clear it right up.

914
00:55:22,320 --> 00:55:24,993
L.A. don't want you no more,
tough guy.

915
00:55:25,400 --> 00:55:26,992
All right?

916
00:55:28,520 --> 00:55:31,080
-How much further to the hospital?
-Five minutes away.

917
00:55:31,240 --> 00:55:33,959
Talk to me. Our mascot,
back in high school, who was it?

918
00:55:34,320 --> 00:55:36,276
Come on, Harry, stay with me.

919
00:55:37,920 --> 00:55:39,558
Whitey, the white knight. Whitey.

920
00:55:39,760 --> 00:55:41,876
I guess it's better
than calling him "Knighty. "

921
00:55:42,040 --> 00:55:45,555
Then it'd be Knighty Knight. Soon
it'd be Toodles, and then Ta-Ta.

922
00:55:45,760 --> 00:55:49,196
-It's very emasculating.
-Harry, that's them. Twelve o'clock.

923
00:55:49,760 --> 00:55:51,830
You said it's a black guy
and a white guy?

924
00:55:52,040 --> 00:55:53,951
You're right.
Get the plate, call the cops.

925
00:55:54,120 --> 00:55:57,032
-Let me find a pen.
-No. Whatever. Watch the road.

926
00:55:57,240 --> 00:55:58,639
Are we slowing down?

927
00:55:58,800 --> 00:56:01,792
-No, I'm getting a pen.
-Are you following them? Better not be.

928
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:05,470
-Tell me you're not following them.
-I'm taking you to the hospital.

929
00:56:05,640 --> 00:56:08,552
-Oh, shit. They're turning.
-What?

930
00:56:08,760 --> 00:56:09,988
Holy shit.

931
00:56:11,360 --> 00:56:15,319
Perry's stakeout. It's a setup. They're
going to MacArthur Park after Perry!

932
00:56:15,480 --> 00:56:18,358
Wait a second! My finger's hanging off.
We gotta move on this.

933
00:56:18,560 --> 00:56:21,120
We're gonna go save Perry,
really quickly.

934
00:56:21,320 --> 00:56:22,833
Then we'll go fix your finger.

935
00:56:23,040 --> 00:56:26,510
It'll be like, "Hey, Perry, look out. "
Boom, back in the car. All right?

936
00:56:26,720 --> 00:56:29,518
-Cool?
-Yeah. This is exhausting.

937
00:56:30,480 --> 00:56:33,074
Bingo. All right. All right, Harry.

938
00:56:33,280 --> 00:56:36,238
Twelve o'clock, that's them.
One of them is on foot.

939
00:56:40,120 --> 00:56:44,557
God, Harry. Shit, if I leave the keys,
can you take yourself to the hospital?

940
00:56:44,760 --> 00:56:46,273
-Oh, yeah, sure.
-All right, good.

941
00:56:46,440 --> 00:56:48,715
-I got the gun you gave me.
-You what?

942
00:57:43,360 --> 00:57:44,952
Perry!

943
00:57:46,520 --> 00:57:48,078
Now, where you going?

944
00:57:51,600 --> 00:57:53,670
No, no, no. Don't fight it.

945
00:57:54,720 --> 00:57:56,790
Let it happen, baby.

946
00:58:29,240 --> 00:58:30,992
Perry!

947
00:58:37,040 --> 00:58:40,032
Perry, watch out!
Goddamn it, turn around!

948
00:58:50,280 --> 00:58:52,077
Son of a bitch!

949
00:58:59,520 --> 00:59:02,751
How about that, you fucking animals!
Goddamn cocksuckers.

950
00:59:24,840 --> 00:59:26,751
-Perry.
-Where the hell did you come from?

951
00:59:26,920 --> 00:59:29,036
-He got away.
-It's okay. You did good.

952
00:59:29,200 --> 00:59:32,795
-I couldn't shoot him, Perry. Oh, God.
-You did fine. You did fine.

953
00:59:32,960 --> 00:59:34,518
We gotta go now.

954
00:59:50,080 --> 00:59:51,638
Hello?

955
01:00:02,320 --> 01:00:04,038
Anyone home?

956
01:00:10,840 --> 01:00:12,432
Hello?

957
01:00:13,800 --> 01:00:18,510
Anyone home?
I got an injury problem. Hello.

958
01:00:18,840 --> 01:00:21,957
All right, first things first.
You've gotta ditch that car.

959
01:00:22,520 --> 01:00:24,397
I know, I know. I've-

960
01:00:24,560 --> 01:00:28,633
I know you said that there was
gonna be consequences, but fuck.

961
01:00:28,800 --> 01:00:30,711
I saw him shot to death.

962
01:00:30,880 --> 01:00:35,590
-I was scared.
-Look, it's okay, yeah.

963
01:00:36,640 --> 01:00:40,155
We can absolutely
talk about it, all right?

964
01:00:40,320 --> 01:00:42,595
Thank you. Thank you so much.

965
01:00:42,760 --> 01:00:45,320
It's nothing against your boss.
I'm grateful. I just-

966
01:00:45,480 --> 01:00:46,754
I spoke to him.

967
01:00:46,920 --> 01:00:49,639
You'll never have to go through anything
like that again.

968
01:00:49,800 --> 01:00:51,472
I swear.

969
01:00:51,840 --> 01:00:53,831
Promise?

970
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:55,479
Yep.

971
01:01:05,120 --> 01:01:06,394
Who are you?

972
01:01:07,480 --> 01:01:09,630
Who are you?

973
01:01:11,400 --> 01:01:12,879
Who-?

974
01:01:54,720 --> 01:01:56,199
Well, hey.

975
01:01:59,240 --> 01:02:02,232
So you still here, huh, tough guy?

976
01:02:03,720 --> 01:02:05,312
Oh, you got a gun, I see.

977
01:02:06,920 --> 01:02:08,592
Well, damn, you are tough.

978
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:57,752
Sorry.

979
01:03:10,600 --> 01:03:12,397
Fuck.

980
01:03:23,440 --> 01:03:25,351
Hey. Hey!

981
01:03:25,520 --> 01:03:26,555
Sit.

982
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:35,911
<i>-Yeah? What?
-Where the hell are you?</i>

983
01:03:36,120 --> 01:03:39,635
I'm with one of the kidnappers. One of
them, anyhow. I shot him. He's dead.

984
01:03:39,800 --> 01:03:41,074
Come here, you fuck.

985
01:03:41,280 --> 01:03:43,271
<i>Wipe the place clean
and get out of there.</i>

986
01:03:43,480 --> 01:03:44,913
I want to, but I can't.

987
01:03:45,120 --> 01:03:48,351
<i>-So do it.
-My fingerprint's here. The dog's got it.</i>

988
01:03:48,520 --> 01:03:52,559
<i>-No one's gonna dust the fucking dog.
-He's got the finger, asshole...</i>

989
01:03:52,720 --> 01:03:55,678
<i>-...with the print part.
-Get the finger, kill the dog, get out.</i>

990
01:03:55,840 --> 01:03:57,796
Hang on.

991
01:03:57,960 --> 01:04:01,350
Shit. Well, I think....

992
01:04:01,560 --> 01:04:03,516
I think we're safe.

993
01:04:04,080 --> 01:04:05,433
<i>Harry?</i>

994
01:04:06,240 --> 01:04:09,550
<i>-Harry?
-Hey, Perry, I shot a guy.</i>

995
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:12,309
I never did that before.

996
01:04:13,680 --> 01:04:15,352
<i>Harry, listen-</i>

997
01:04:23,640 --> 01:04:26,473
<i>-link to the items found
in the Silver Lake home...</i>

998
01:04:26,640 --> 01:04:29,108
<i>...to the kidnap-murder
of socialite Veronica Dexter.</i>

999
01:04:29,440 --> 01:04:31,829
<i>Police theorize a falling out
between the kidnappers...</i>

1000
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:35,072
<i>...resulting in at least two deaths,
and possibly a third tonight.</i>

1001
01:04:35,240 --> 01:04:38,277
So this evening,
was it Jonny Gossamer enough for you?

1002
01:04:38,440 --> 01:04:41,876
To tell you the truth, Jonny Gossamer
always has a way bigger ending.

1003
01:04:42,040 --> 01:04:44,429
There's always the part
where the guy gets tortured.

1004
01:04:44,600 --> 01:04:48,354
Yeah, tortured, sure. Then he usually
breaks free and shoots, like, 16 guys.

1005
01:04:48,560 --> 01:04:51,836
Yeah, 16 guys. It's always 16.
That's funny.

1006
01:04:55,880 --> 01:04:59,953
So this thing, it's over, right? They say
the kidnappers are all dead, so....

1007
01:05:00,120 --> 01:05:02,588
Well, Harry, I'd be lying to you
if I didn't say...

1008
01:05:02,760 --> 01:05:05,194
...that I still didn't have
a few questions.

1009
01:05:05,360 --> 01:05:06,839
Harmony's sister.

1010
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:10,117
If she stumbles on a murder plot,
why hire me to film it?

1011
01:05:10,280 --> 01:05:13,192
-Why not simply go to the police?
-Right. And I still think...

1012
01:05:13,360 --> 01:05:16,272
...this Veronica Dexter
father-daughter business is wanky.

1013
01:05:16,440 --> 01:05:19,318
So the whole reconcilement thing?

1014
01:05:19,480 --> 01:05:21,118
"Reconciliation," idiot.

1015
01:05:21,280 --> 01:05:25,353
She comes back to the States, drops
the lawsuit, moves in with her father.

1016
01:05:25,520 --> 01:05:28,239
-Suddenly they're inseparable?
-So, what are you saying?

1017
01:05:28,440 --> 01:05:30,556
We're gonna, like, probe deeper?

1018
01:05:30,760 --> 01:05:32,318
-Absolutely not.
-What?

1019
01:05:32,480 --> 01:05:34,630
What are you talking about?
My sister paid you.

1020
01:05:34,840 --> 01:05:36,910
-What, you're gonna bail?
-Harmony...

1021
01:05:37,080 --> 01:05:39,230
...do you want your sister's
money back? Done.

1022
01:05:39,400 --> 01:05:41,789
In the meantime, back off.

1023
01:05:41,960 --> 01:05:43,757
Before you get me and Harry killed.

1024
01:05:57,400 --> 01:05:58,992
Pardon me.

1025
01:05:59,160 --> 01:06:01,230
Hey, I lucked out.
They gave me the same room.

1026
01:06:01,400 --> 01:06:03,789
-Lucky you.
-It's pretty good. You wanna come up?

1027
01:06:03,960 --> 01:06:06,713
No, I don't wanna come up.
Why would I go up there?

1028
01:06:06,920 --> 01:06:09,673
-They cleaned it.
-The car is coming. I'm going. Jesus.

1029
01:06:14,600 --> 01:06:16,079
You know what, Harry? Stop.

1030
01:06:17,320 --> 01:06:19,117
Why'd you lie to me?

1031
01:06:21,480 --> 01:06:24,790
It was an excuse to stay around you.
So I think, in the realm of lies-

1032
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:26,592
You are such a dumb-ass.

1033
01:06:28,200 --> 01:06:31,510
-I am so not who you think I am, Harry.
-And who would that be?

1034
01:06:31,680 --> 01:06:34,240
You think I'm-You think I'm amazing.

1035
01:06:34,640 --> 01:06:36,835
You do. You think I'm so amazing...

1036
01:06:37,040 --> 01:06:38,996
...because that's who
I told you I'd be.

1037
01:06:39,160 --> 01:06:40,673
Yeah, that was the game plan.

1038
01:06:40,880 --> 01:06:43,440
-You know what? It worked.
-No one else thinks so.

1039
01:06:43,640 --> 01:06:46,791
-My opinion doesn't count?
-No, it doesn't.

1040
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:48,319
Because you're new here.

1041
01:06:48,480 --> 01:06:50,357
Look around,
there's younger and better.

1042
01:06:50,560 --> 01:06:52,835
I don't want younger and better,
I want you.

1043
01:06:53,040 --> 01:06:55,110
I'm such a moron. I'm sorry.
You know what-

1044
01:06:55,320 --> 01:06:58,198
-It doesn't matter, I'm going. Look, just-
-I'm such an idiot.

1045
01:07:01,520 --> 01:07:04,159
I steal shit.

1046
01:07:06,680 --> 01:07:08,716
-Come again?
-That's what I do for a living.

1047
01:07:08,880 --> 01:07:10,552
I steal audio-visual components.

1048
01:07:10,720 --> 01:07:13,917
I steal. I robbed a house.
I stole this watch.

1049
01:07:14,080 --> 01:07:17,789
It's a cool watch. It's got this
little light thing. I stole this gum...

1050
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:21,356
...from the lobby,
because it was kind of a rush.

1051
01:07:21,560 --> 01:07:26,634
I've never finished anything
that I've started my entire life.

1052
01:07:28,040 --> 01:07:30,759
Not school, not marriage, nothing.

1053
01:07:31,480 --> 01:07:34,711
And I have this thing where,
like halfway in the middle, I just...

1054
01:07:34,880 --> 01:07:36,598
...and I cut and run.

1055
01:07:36,800 --> 01:07:39,633
Like the other night
when you were all over me...

1056
01:07:39,800 --> 01:07:41,870
...and you gave up
and just went for it with-

1057
01:07:42,040 --> 01:07:45,555
Prime example. I switched to the ugly
friend. Homely friend. She's not ugly.

1058
01:07:45,760 --> 01:07:47,876
She's homely.

1059
01:07:49,320 --> 01:07:52,471
Don't go. Please.

1060
01:07:52,640 --> 01:07:54,278
Not yet.

1061
01:07:54,440 --> 01:07:55,998
This isn't finished.

1062
01:08:04,400 --> 01:08:05,719
-Turn around.
-Why?

1063
01:08:05,880 --> 01:08:08,474
-Just turn around.
-What, my tag's out?

1064
01:08:08,640 --> 01:08:11,950
-This dump have a bar?
-Yeah.

1065
01:08:12,280 --> 01:08:15,078
-Call me "Slick" from here on out.
-That was such a good job.

1066
01:08:15,280 --> 01:08:17,032
You snagged a ton of gum.

1067
01:08:17,200 --> 01:08:20,192
-I mean, petty theft-
-Oh, Harry.

1068
01:08:20,360 --> 01:08:24,114
I really didn't need
that last shot of tequila.

1069
01:08:24,280 --> 01:08:27,192
Oh, God.

1070
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:42,275
I just had a weird thought.

1071
01:08:42,440 --> 01:08:45,955
Veronica Dexter. I saw the body
up close. Hell, I carried the damn thing.

1072
01:08:46,120 --> 01:08:49,351
Both times, the dress was soaked
through, so it was transparent. So-

1073
01:08:49,520 --> 01:08:51,988
God, Harry,
where are you going with this?

1074
01:08:52,200 --> 01:08:54,111
No, no, no. It's just-

1075
01:08:54,760 --> 01:08:57,558
Perry said this chick was deep
into the born-again bit...

1076
01:08:57,720 --> 01:09:02,714
...so it's probably nothing,
but just if she had on underwear...

1077
01:09:03,440 --> 01:09:06,512
...I didn't see any.

1078
01:09:08,680 --> 01:09:11,956
-I guess I'm taking the couch.
-Yeah. Thanks.

1079
01:09:12,120 --> 01:09:16,432
Or you can sleep here.
But it would only be sleeping, Harry.

1080
01:09:18,360 --> 01:09:21,033
If that's gonna frustrate you.

1081
01:09:21,640 --> 01:09:23,437
Let's see.

1082
01:09:30,480 --> 01:09:32,789
Oh, Harry.

1083
01:09:34,360 --> 01:09:36,510
So long ago.

1084
01:09:38,760 --> 01:09:42,719
Didn't really turn out
the way we hoped, did it?

1085
01:09:43,600 --> 01:09:49,357
I guess if I racked my brain,
I could think of worse places to be.

1086
01:09:51,600 --> 01:09:55,275
-Is that so, Whitey?
-Whitey?

1087
01:09:55,440 --> 01:09:57,510
-Calling me a knight?
-Maybe, yeah.

1088
01:09:57,680 --> 01:10:00,592
Except for the boner.
That's not too knightly.

1089
01:10:00,760 --> 01:10:03,797
The hell it isn't.
Actually, it's nightly and most mornings.

1090
01:10:10,040 --> 01:10:11,871
Fuck it, I'm not a knight. I'm sorry.

1091
01:10:12,040 --> 01:10:14,429
I'm thinking-
I'm going nuts, so I think maybe...

1092
01:10:14,600 --> 01:10:16,795
-...the couch is good.
-What? Stop. Harry.

1093
01:10:16,960 --> 01:10:18,916
Or I can keep drinking
until it goes away.

1094
01:10:19,080 --> 01:10:21,435
Harry, seriously,
if you're at all uncomfortable...

1095
01:10:21,600 --> 01:10:23,795
...I am more than happy
to do something.

1096
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:25,433
-For chrissake, no.
-Why not?

1097
01:10:25,600 --> 01:10:28,592
I don't want you to offer it as-
Not, "It's a courtesy freebie. "

1098
01:10:28,800 --> 01:10:30,756
-You're so anal.
-I don't want the backup:

1099
01:10:30,920 --> 01:10:33,718
"Let me just give you a hand here"...

1100
01:10:33,880 --> 01:10:39,079
...as a kind of, like,
default backup thing.

1101
01:10:58,760 --> 01:11:01,832
You're gonna stop calling me.

1102
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:03,752
No. You know, that's crazy.

1103
01:11:03,920 --> 01:11:05,672
I swear to God, this is it.

1104
01:11:05,880 --> 01:11:08,314
You are the dream girl.
You always have been.

1105
01:11:08,480 --> 01:11:10,869
This is destiny.

1106
01:11:11,320 --> 01:11:13,117
Okay.

1107
01:11:18,160 --> 01:11:20,913
Before we do this...

1108
01:11:21,080 --> 01:11:23,753
...I have a little confession to make.

1109
01:11:24,600 --> 01:11:28,752
My best friend! You said you were going
to drop by his house, wave goodbye.

1110
01:11:28,960 --> 01:11:31,315
I was leaving for L.A.
I was never gonna see him-

1111
01:11:31,480 --> 01:11:33,072
-He looked sad.
-He looked sad?

1112
01:11:33,240 --> 01:11:35,470
-Yes, he did.
-You slept with Chook Chutney.

1113
01:11:35,680 --> 01:11:38,069
Fuck. For chrissake, Harry,
it was forever ago.

1114
01:11:38,240 --> 01:11:40,310
Come on,
I was a different person back then.

1115
01:11:40,520 --> 01:11:42,670
-You slept with Chook. Excuse me.
-Come on.

1116
01:11:42,840 --> 01:11:44,717
-Watch your hand.
-Harry!

1117
01:12:23,440 --> 01:12:27,035
<i>-Yeah.
-Harry, was she raped?</i>

1118
01:12:28,280 --> 01:12:30,191
The Dexter girl, was she raped?

1119
01:12:31,160 --> 01:12:34,516
No, the ME's report showed no
indication of rape stuff.

1120
01:12:34,680 --> 01:12:36,398
You slept with Chook Chutney.

1121
01:12:53,480 --> 01:12:57,234
Wake up. Harry, wake up.

1122
01:12:58,640 --> 01:13:00,870
-Get up.
-What's up?

1123
01:13:01,040 --> 01:13:03,395
Harmony's in trouble. Get dressed.

1124
01:13:03,560 --> 01:13:05,118
Let's go.

1125
01:13:07,200 --> 01:13:10,351
<i>Perry, it's me. Listen,
this Veronica Dexter business stinks.</i>

1126
01:13:10,520 --> 01:13:12,636
<i>I'm gonna go
check on something Harry said.</i>

1127
01:13:12,800 --> 01:13:14,756
<i>Call me. If I'm right, you'll shit.</i>

1128
01:13:15,360 --> 01:13:16,998
-What did you say to her?
-Nothing.

1129
01:13:17,200 --> 01:13:20,112
-I don't get what's happening.
-She solved this thing.

1130
01:13:20,280 --> 01:13:24,558
That sly little minx of yours has solved
this case, and now I can't find her.

1131
01:13:24,720 --> 01:13:26,676
-You're worried.
-You're not worried?

1132
01:13:26,840 --> 01:13:28,478
Of course. If you are, I should be.

1133
01:13:28,680 --> 01:13:30,398
Now, what did you say? Think.

1134
01:13:30,600 --> 01:13:33,398
-You said something about the case.
-Yeah. Yeah.

1135
01:13:33,600 --> 01:13:35,192
What?

1136
01:13:40,880 --> 01:13:43,110
<i>I tell him about destiny.
He's shaking his head.</i>

1137
01:13:43,280 --> 01:13:47,068
<i>About dream girls, he doesn't care.
I mention the underwear thing...</i>

1138
01:13:47,240 --> 01:13:48,798
<i>...he has a fucking conniption.</i>

1139
01:13:48,960 --> 01:13:50,916
<i>And you?
How about it, filmgoer?</i>

1140
01:13:52,760 --> 01:13:55,354
<i>Have you solved the case
of the dead people in L.A.?</i>

1141
01:13:55,520 --> 01:13:57,988
<i>Times Square audiences,
don't shout at the screen.</i>

1142
01:13:58,160 --> 01:14:00,754
<i>And stop picking at that,
it'll just get worse.</i>

1143
01:14:03,200 --> 01:14:06,033
-This won't take a second.
-Right.

1144
01:14:18,360 --> 01:14:20,954
Hi. How are you doing tonight?

1145
01:14:21,120 --> 01:14:22,997
They gave away my crickets.

1146
01:14:26,960 --> 01:14:30,919
Excuse me, you wouldn't, by chance,
happen to have seen this woman?

1147
01:14:31,080 --> 01:14:34,789
No. I don't like him.
Kurt Cobain, he took my cricket.

1148
01:14:34,960 --> 01:14:36,313
Of course. That's sad.

1149
01:14:36,480 --> 01:14:39,677
Ma'am, I hope you won't be offended
when I ask you...

1150
01:14:39,840 --> 01:14:43,150
...if you're wearing anything at all
underneath your hospital blues.

1151
01:14:43,320 --> 01:14:46,835
Any undergarments. It's important.

1152
01:14:59,240 --> 01:15:01,674
That's the clue.
Veronica Dexter was a patient here.

1153
01:15:01,840 --> 01:15:05,196
Private mental clinic,
where even nice girls don't wear undies.

1154
01:15:05,400 --> 01:15:08,392
How could she be here and meanwhile,
she's out having parties?

1155
01:15:08,560 --> 01:15:12,553
Think. First she hates her dad, then loves
him. Has a lawsuit, withdraws it. Why?

1156
01:15:12,760 --> 01:15:14,955
-I'll tell you why.
-Oh, my God.

1157
01:15:18,640 --> 01:15:20,995
Oh, my God.
So it's two different girls, right?

1158
01:15:21,160 --> 01:15:24,550
He stashed his daughter in here,
and then he put the ringer on the street.

1159
01:15:24,760 --> 01:15:27,752
He needs someone who looks like her
to withdraw the complaint.

1160
01:15:28,240 --> 01:15:29,958
-It's been 10 years.
-This is nuts.

1161
01:15:30,160 --> 01:15:32,435
-It's right out of a Gossamer book.
-Of course...

1162
01:15:32,600 --> 01:15:35,353
...because the guy who planned
the crimes has all the books.

1163
01:15:35,520 --> 01:15:39,877
He's read them all. They're in his house.
Plus, he was in that piece of shit...

1164
01:15:40,040 --> 01:15:41,712
...movie.

1165
01:15:42,640 --> 01:15:44,471
You're telling me the girl imposter-

1166
01:15:44,680 --> 01:15:46,750
A desperate man needs
a replacement daughter.

1167
01:15:46,920 --> 01:15:48,876
Along comes a girl, Harmony's sister.

1168
01:15:49,080 --> 01:15:52,629
-Fresh off the bus, looking for her dad.
-I'd say I found my imposter.

1169
01:15:52,800 --> 01:15:54,870
Let's get out of here.

1170
01:15:56,720 --> 01:15:59,598
-So where did she go from here?
-Shut up, I'm thinking.

1171
01:15:59,800 --> 01:16:01,199
By the way, this thing:

1172
01:16:01,360 --> 01:16:03,271
Single gayest thing you've ever done.

1173
01:16:03,480 --> 01:16:06,278
-Evening, gentlemen.
-Hi, we are so incredibly lost.

1174
01:16:06,440 --> 01:16:08,032
Mr. Van Shrike, hello.

1175
01:16:08,240 --> 01:16:10,470
You look chilly. Come back inside.

1176
01:16:10,680 --> 01:16:13,069
I'm from back East.
I'm kind of digging the cold.

1177
01:16:13,280 --> 01:16:16,909
-Fuck! He's the one who said it.
-Or I can kill you here.

1178
01:16:20,560 --> 01:16:23,916
Harry, I was thinking some more
about this reality versus fiction.

1179
01:16:24,080 --> 01:16:28,756
Like in the movies, when a guy sticks
a gun at some schmuck's back and says:

1180
01:16:28,960 --> 01:16:31,952
-"Let's take a walk. " He's got a hostage.
-I've seen that movie.

1181
01:16:32,120 --> 01:16:35,476
In reality, the pros like about
five feet of separation.

1182
01:16:35,640 --> 01:16:39,349
That's so the schmuck doesn't take
the gun back and make him eat it.

1183
01:16:42,160 --> 01:16:44,549
Doesn't that suck?
I just hit you for no reason.

1184
01:16:44,760 --> 01:16:46,876
Watch it.

1185
01:16:51,880 --> 01:16:54,440
-Tell us where Harmony is.
-Fuck you, mary.

1186
01:16:54,600 --> 01:16:57,558
You don't get it, do you?
This isn't "good cop, bad cop. "

1187
01:16:57,760 --> 01:17:01,275
This is fag and New Yorker.
You're in a lot of trouble.

1188
01:17:01,440 --> 01:17:05,797
For chrissake, who are you protecting?
It's all over. Dexter is going down.

1189
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:08,150
-Down.
-I know about Veronica's lawsuit.

1190
01:17:08,360 --> 01:17:11,477
I know Dexter was facing ruin.
I even know he switched daughters.

1191
01:17:11,640 --> 01:17:14,837
Which, for God's sake, actually
did work for a while, till last week.

1192
01:17:15,040 --> 01:17:17,508
-Then he had to kill her, huh?
-Put a sock in it.

1193
01:17:17,680 --> 01:17:19,910
-I'm asking a question.
-If you ask questions...

1194
01:17:20,080 --> 01:17:22,640
...then it seems like
we don't know anything. Okay?

1195
01:17:22,800 --> 01:17:25,598
And for the record, it was the boyfriend,
the guy from Paris.

1196
01:17:25,800 --> 01:17:29,270
He would've spotted the fake and said,
"That's not Veronica. " Am I right?

1197
01:17:29,440 --> 01:17:31,476
-Fuck you!
-Exactly.

1198
01:17:31,640 --> 01:17:34,154
So Dexter had Veronica killed,
threw a dress on her...

1199
01:17:34,360 --> 01:17:37,670
...dumped the body and walked away
clean, except for one little thing.

1200
01:17:37,880 --> 01:17:40,917
-Underpants.
-One tiny little pair of undies.

1201
01:17:41,120 --> 01:17:42,519
Yeah.

1202
01:17:43,400 --> 01:17:46,551
You think that's funny, huh?
I'm gonna break your nose now.

1203
01:17:47,040 --> 01:17:50,555
I want you to picture a bullet inside
your head. Can you do that for me?

1204
01:17:50,720 --> 01:17:52,517
Fuck you.

1205
01:17:52,680 --> 01:17:55,319
-Anyway, that's ambiguous.
-Ambiguous? I don't think so.

1206
01:17:55,480 --> 01:17:57,994
He means when you say,
"Picture it inside your head"...

1207
01:17:58,160 --> 01:18:00,390
...is that "a bullet
will be inside your head"...

1208
01:18:00,560 --> 01:18:03,279
-...or "picture it in your head"?
-Harry, will you shut up.

1209
01:18:03,440 --> 01:18:06,477
I don't know anything about a girl,
seriously. I was bluffing.

1210
01:18:06,640 --> 01:18:10,713
-I think that you are bluffing right now.
-Harry, what are you doing?

1211
01:18:10,880 --> 01:18:13,075
What I'm doing for the guy
who likes to bluff...

1212
01:18:13,280 --> 01:18:18,434
...is I'm playing a little game called
"Am I Bluffing?" Where is she?

1213
01:18:18,640 --> 01:18:21,154
Where the fuck is Harmony?
You want to play hardball?

1214
01:18:21,360 --> 01:18:23,999
Where is the girl?

1215
01:18:24,480 --> 01:18:25,993
What did you just do?

1216
01:18:26,200 --> 01:18:29,510
-I just put in one bullet, didn't I?
-You put a live round in that gun?

1217
01:18:29,680 --> 01:18:32,353
Yeah, there was like
an 8 percent chance.

1218
01:18:32,520 --> 01:18:35,956
-Eight? Who taught you math?
-Maybe it was more. I don't know-

1219
01:18:36,560 --> 01:18:38,232
Shit!

1220
01:18:38,880 --> 01:18:40,757
<i>-Hello?
-Perry, is that you?</i>

1221
01:18:40,920 --> 01:18:42,831
<i>-Hey, it's me.
-Hi, Harmony.</i>

1222
01:18:43,040 --> 01:18:44,712
<i>-What's going on?
-Where are you?</i>

1223
01:18:44,880 --> 01:18:46,313
<i>-At home.
-You're at home?</i>

1224
01:18:46,480 --> 01:18:49,392
I just got back. I was in the Hills
all day. Shitty reception.

1225
01:18:49,560 --> 01:18:52,711
-You don't sound so good.
-Why aren't you following your lead?

1226
01:18:52,920 --> 01:18:54,831
Oh, forget it. It's just crazy.

1227
01:18:55,040 --> 01:18:56,837
No, it's not crazy. Listen-

1228
01:18:57,040 --> 01:19:00,271
<i>-It's right out of a Gossamer book.
-Don't talk. Listen.</i>

1229
01:19:00,480 --> 01:19:02,550
-Eight percent.
-And you, stop multiplying.

1230
01:19:02,720 --> 01:19:05,314
No, not you. Listen, call downtown...

1231
01:19:05,480 --> 01:19:08,153
...see if Veronica Dexter's body
has gone to the mortuary.

1232
01:19:08,320 --> 01:19:10,595
<i>If it has, see if there's
a cremation scheduled.</i>

1233
01:19:10,760 --> 01:19:13,752
-Wait, Perry.
-Call me back right away.

1234
01:19:16,280 --> 01:19:18,919
Look, he was gonna kill you anyway.
He said so.

1235
01:19:22,640 --> 01:19:24,392
Cover him up. I'll get the car.

1236
01:19:26,920 --> 01:19:29,798
-All right, that's pretty much all done.
-Harry-

1237
01:19:29,960 --> 01:19:34,875
I got an idea. I say we take
the son of a bitch Dexter down.

1238
01:19:36,320 --> 01:19:40,154
To the racetrack and buy
the son of a gun a drink.

1239
01:19:40,320 --> 01:19:44,791
What do you say, Perry?
Oh, fuck, no fair. No fucking fair.

1240
01:19:44,960 --> 01:19:48,077
Aurelio, give Mr. Van Shrike
a little pat down.

1241
01:19:55,760 --> 01:19:58,194
<i>Fucking maricn.</i>

1242
01:20:01,480 --> 01:20:03,835
Toss it here. Let's see who it is.

1243
01:20:05,960 --> 01:20:07,552
We're in trouble. Dexter's got us.

1244
01:20:12,040 --> 01:20:14,429
He just asked a carpet-cleaning service
to save him.

1245
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:17,355
Sorry, kid. Good hands, though.

1246
01:20:17,560 --> 01:20:20,472
Thanks. Used to be a magician.

1247
01:20:21,000 --> 01:20:25,391
And for 39.99 we'll carpet
up to three rooms in half the time.

1248
01:20:25,560 --> 01:20:28,870
That's a $40 value. Act today.

1249
01:20:31,880 --> 01:20:34,872
That chick in the casket,
she won't even match up with that...

1250
01:20:35,040 --> 01:20:37,952
...ringer you been toting around.
You ever think about that?

1251
01:20:38,120 --> 01:20:40,634
He did, Harry.
That's why he's cremating the body.

1252
01:20:42,120 --> 01:20:43,678
Yeah, you ready?

1253
01:20:45,320 --> 01:20:48,198
Speak of the devil. Gotta go.

1254
01:20:48,360 --> 01:20:51,796
Perry, nice to have known you.

1255
01:20:52,440 --> 01:20:53,998
-Harry.
-Harry. Yes, of course.

1256
01:20:54,160 --> 01:20:55,479
Harry from New York.

1257
01:20:55,680 --> 01:20:59,639
I hope you don't judge Los Angeles
based solely on your experience tonight.

1258
01:21:07,080 --> 01:21:09,640
I'm kind of scared here, Perry.

1259
01:21:09,800 --> 01:21:12,075
Aurelio, why don't you give
the kid a break?

1260
01:21:12,240 --> 01:21:14,674
Do unto others and all that.
It's Christmas.

1261
01:21:14,840 --> 01:21:16,910
-Who else knows?
-I don't know anything.

1262
01:21:17,120 --> 01:21:19,270
I'm not even from here, you fuck-up.

1263
01:21:31,480 --> 01:21:33,436
Mr. Dexter, the coffin's good to go.

1264
01:21:33,600 --> 01:21:36,194
Okay, let's burn the bitch.

1265
01:21:39,000 --> 01:21:40,991
You could zap his chest.
It'd be easier.

1266
01:21:41,200 --> 01:21:43,111
But we know why you gotta do
it down there.

1267
01:21:43,280 --> 01:21:45,396
You like looking at his johnson,
don't you?

1268
01:21:45,560 --> 01:21:47,278
Admit it, dude, you got it in you.

1269
01:21:50,480 --> 01:21:54,792
Enough! Look me in the eyes and
tell me you've never been with a man.

1270
01:21:55,000 --> 01:21:58,072
<i>-Fuck you, maricn! Fuck you!
-That's what you want, isn't it?</i>

1271
01:21:58,280 --> 01:22:01,272
-You want to fuck me.
-Stop helping. Stop helping.

1272
01:22:01,480 --> 01:22:04,074
<i>-If you are not gay, just say so.
-Fuck you, maricn!</i>

1273
01:22:05,160 --> 01:22:07,993
-Look at him. He can't even say it.
-Stop helping!

1274
01:22:08,200 --> 01:22:10,668
-Can't wait to have you as a patient.
-Bet you can't.

1275
01:22:10,880 --> 01:22:12,711
-This is what you want. Here.
-Shut up!

1276
01:22:12,920 --> 01:22:15,798
Take a look. You want some of this
right here? Look at this.

1277
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:17,149
Just shut up!

1278
01:22:20,840 --> 01:22:22,353
Yeah!

1279
01:22:24,880 --> 01:22:27,269
Homophobes never check there.

1280
01:22:28,960 --> 01:22:32,191
Thank God you had a gun in there.
I thought it was a gay thing...

1281
01:22:32,400 --> 01:22:35,039
...like somehow
you guys could do that. Sorry.

1282
01:22:35,200 --> 01:22:38,112
-Are you okay?
-Not really, no.

1283
01:22:38,480 --> 01:22:40,994
Gentlemen, let's wrap it up
and get out of here.

1284
01:22:43,200 --> 01:22:46,317
-Who's driving?
-I tell you what, I'll flip you for it.

1285
01:22:46,480 --> 01:22:48,232
All right.

1286
01:22:52,640 --> 01:22:54,471
-This way, come on.
-Shit!

1287
01:23:00,360 --> 01:23:02,669
<i>-Yeah.
-Hey, Harmony, it's me.</i>

1288
01:23:02,840 --> 01:23:04,751
Oh, God, how did you get away?

1289
01:23:04,960 --> 01:23:07,520
I shot him with a small revolver
I keep near my balls.

1290
01:23:07,720 --> 01:23:11,349
I can't get to my car. We're near Olive
and the freeway. Can you pick us up?

1291
01:23:11,520 --> 01:23:14,239
<i>I'm in a van with the body.
I'll be there in 30 seconds.</i>

1292
01:23:14,440 --> 01:23:17,034
All right, be where I can see you.
Be ready to move.

1293
01:23:18,320 --> 01:23:21,949
Shit, they're on my tail. I gotta go.

1294
01:23:32,440 --> 01:23:35,876
Right there. She's right there! Shit.

1295
01:23:43,080 --> 01:23:44,672
Harmony!

1296
01:24:01,240 --> 01:24:03,276
Harmony!

1297
01:24:18,280 --> 01:24:20,077
-Harmony!
-Harry, don't!

1298
01:24:47,600 --> 01:24:51,309
Come on, we gotta go. They're coming
back around. Harmony's down there.

1299
01:24:53,600 --> 01:24:56,910
Perry, what's wrong?

1300
01:24:58,360 --> 01:25:00,237
Come on, breathe.

1301
01:25:14,520 --> 01:25:16,397
Harry.

1302
01:25:22,120 --> 01:25:23,758
Harold.

1303
01:25:47,160 --> 01:25:48,912
<i>Harold...</i>

1304
01:25:49,240 --> 01:25:52,437

1305
01:25:52,640 --> 01:25:55,996
<i>Save me from this hopeless plight.</i>

1306

<i>Harold...</i>

01:26:48,320 --> 01:26:49,799
Harmony!

1308
01:27:01,840 --> 01:27:05,310
Captain Fucking Magic.

1309
01:27:10,920 --> 01:27:12,273
Come on!

1310
01:27:24,040 --> 01:27:25,393
No.

1311
01:27:33,000 --> 01:27:35,878
There, all done.

1312
01:27:37,240 --> 01:27:38,992
Finished.

1313
01:27:48,040 --> 01:27:49,553
Harry.

1314
01:27:51,920 --> 01:27:55,276
-Did you call me?
-Harry, you're shot.

1315
01:27:55,440 --> 01:27:57,749
No, no. Look, you want
to see something cool?

1316
01:28:00,320 --> 01:28:03,869
Cool! This stopped the bullet, Harry.

1317
01:28:10,880 --> 01:28:12,996
No, not really.

1318
01:28:13,760 --> 01:28:15,239
Oh, Harry.

1319
01:28:15,440 --> 01:28:17,954
Oh, God, Harry.

1320
01:28:20,760 --> 01:28:22,318
Harry.

1321
01:28:31,560 --> 01:28:35,872
-Hi. Welcome back.
-Yeah.

1322
01:28:37,720 --> 01:28:41,110
-How many fingers?
-Put that cat down, because I'm allergic.

1323
01:28:42,720 --> 01:28:45,359
You feeling okay? How's your...?

1324
01:28:45,520 --> 01:28:47,750
-My what?
-Well, your....

1325
01:28:47,960 --> 01:28:51,316
-Everything down there.
-I can't believe he told you that.

1326
01:28:53,720 --> 01:28:55,756
It's Christmas,
where's my present, Slick?

1327
01:28:55,960 --> 01:28:58,076
Your present is you're not in jail,
fag-hag.

1328
01:28:58,280 --> 01:29:00,919
<i>Yeah, boo, hiss, I know.
Look, I hate it too.</i>

1329
01:29:01,080 --> 01:29:04,356
<i>In movies where the studio gets all
paranoid about a downer ending...</i>

1330
01:29:04,520 --> 01:29:08,229
<i>...so the guy shows up, he's magically
alive on crutches, I hate that.</i>

1331
01:29:08,400 --> 01:29:11,392
<i>I mean, shit,
why not bring them all back.</i>

1332
01:29:12,320 --> 01:29:16,154
<i>But the point is, in this case,
this time, it really happened.</i>

1333
01:29:16,320 --> 01:29:18,788
<i>Perry, like, lived.
Yeah, it's a dumb movie thing...</i>

1334
01:29:18,960 --> 01:29:21,474
<i>...but what do you want me to do,
lie about it?</i>

1335
01:29:21,640 --> 01:29:23,358
So you found something out?

1336
01:29:23,520 --> 01:29:26,512
Yeah. But you're not gonna like it.

1337
01:29:28,040 --> 01:29:29,996
Dexter didn't murder your sister.

1338
01:29:30,800 --> 01:29:34,634
That's crazy. He was using my sister
to impersonate his daughter, Perry.

1339
01:29:34,800 --> 01:29:37,394
Never happened.
I talked to my police guy.

1340
01:29:38,720 --> 01:29:44,670
The ringer was a girl named Mia Frye,
23-year-old from Glendale.

1341
01:29:44,880 --> 01:29:47,189
When she wasn't impersonating
Veronica Dexter...

1342
01:29:47,360 --> 01:29:49,476
...she wore a pink wig.

1343
01:29:51,440 --> 01:29:55,672
But my sister sent you up
to Big Bear Lake, to his cabin.

1344
01:29:57,120 --> 01:30:00,908
Your sister was convinced
that Dexter was her natural father...

1345
01:30:01,120 --> 01:30:03,509
...so she started following him,
hanging around.

1346
01:30:03,720 --> 01:30:06,109
Do you see where I'm going with this?

1347
01:30:06,520 --> 01:30:09,353
One day your sister came calling,
and she saw Dexter...

1348
01:30:09,520 --> 01:30:11,351
...in bed with the pink-haired girl.

1349
01:30:11,560 --> 01:30:14,120
What she thought
was father and daughter.

1350
01:30:14,280 --> 01:30:16,430
Remember,
that's how it would appear.

1351
01:30:16,600 --> 01:30:17,953
It was too much for her.

1352
01:30:18,120 --> 01:30:22,352
First the old father,
now the shiny new one.

1353
01:30:22,560 --> 01:30:27,315
She couldn't handle it,
and she took her own life.

1354
01:30:27,920 --> 01:30:31,799
What she hired me to film
wasn't murder, but incest.

1355
01:30:34,120 --> 01:30:36,111
I'm sorry.

1356
01:30:36,280 --> 01:30:38,191
<i>So much for unreality.</i>

1357
01:30:38,360 --> 01:30:39,759
<i>I said goodbye...</i>

1358
01:30:40,160 --> 01:30:43,596
<i>...watched Jonny's world
go back on the fiction shelf.</i>

1359
01:30:43,760 --> 01:30:46,228
<i>But while it lasted, brother...</i>

1360
01:30:47,040 --> 01:30:48,996
<i>...it was one for the books.</i>

1361
01:30:50,240 --> 01:30:52,674
You should've told me
you were arrested five times.

1362
01:30:53,360 --> 01:30:54,839
I should be pissed.

1363
01:30:55,000 --> 01:30:58,515
You should have told me that when you
go home, you put on lady's underpants.

1364
01:30:58,680 --> 01:31:00,671
-That's cross-dressing, imbecile.
-Whatever.

1365
01:31:00,840 --> 01:31:04,389
Half those guys are straight.
Perfect fathers, love their kids.

1366
01:31:04,560 --> 01:31:06,516
How about you?
Did your father love you?

1367
01:31:06,680 --> 01:31:10,514
Sometimes. You know, when I dressed
up like a bottle. How about yours?

1368
01:31:10,680 --> 01:31:13,558
Well, he used to beat me in Morse code,
so it's possible...

1369
01:31:13,760 --> 01:31:16,035
...but he never
actually said the words.

1370
01:31:16,200 --> 01:31:18,395
-Harry.
-What?

1371
01:31:18,560 --> 01:31:20,790
Don't steal any more shit.

1372
01:31:21,720 --> 01:31:23,631
You're not a punk.

1373
01:31:27,200 --> 01:31:28,394
You bet I'll turn around.

1374
01:31:28,720 --> 01:31:29,948
You like that, huh?

1375
01:31:30,120 --> 01:31:33,396
I saw him in the commissary twice.
What is he, like 6'4"?

1376
01:31:33,560 --> 01:31:36,552
He doesn't know he's gay.
Look how he walks.

1377
01:31:36,720 --> 01:31:38,278
<i>So that's pretty much that.</i>

1378
01:31:38,440 --> 01:31:41,273
<i>We went back to Indiana,
the three of us, for Jenna's funeral.</i>

1379
01:31:42,880 --> 01:31:44,996
<i>Don't worry,
I saw the last Lord of the Rings.</i>

1380
01:31:45,160 --> 01:31:46,832
<i>I won't have the movie end 17 times.</i>

1381
01:31:47,000 --> 01:31:49,753
<i>There is, though, one final scene
for your viewing pleasure.</i>

1382
01:31:59,040 --> 01:32:00,996
Do I know you?

1383
01:32:04,920 --> 01:32:07,388
No. Just in town for the funeral.

1384
01:32:07,840 --> 01:32:09,114
What do you want?

1385
01:32:09,320 --> 01:32:13,279
The zoo was closed, so I thought
I'd come here and look at an animal.

1386
01:32:13,480 --> 01:32:14,913
Son of a-

1387
01:32:15,080 --> 01:32:17,799
Who do you think you're talking to?

1388
01:32:17,960 --> 01:32:20,155
I buried my daughter today.

1389
01:32:20,360 --> 01:32:22,396
No.

1390
01:32:22,760 --> 01:32:25,513
You buried her 20 years ago.

1391
01:32:25,720 --> 01:32:29,599
Harmony was right,
her sister was murdered.

1392
01:32:29,760 --> 01:32:33,548
You pulled the trigger. It just took
this long for the bullet to hit.

1393
01:32:34,400 --> 01:32:36,516
Who are you?

1394
01:32:37,560 --> 01:32:39,357
I loved my girl.

1395
01:32:40,240 --> 01:32:43,550
You fucker!
If I could get out of this bed-

1396
01:32:43,720 --> 01:32:46,996
Yeah? Well, you can't.

1397
01:32:47,880 --> 01:32:50,110
You bastard!

1398
01:32:53,480 --> 01:32:55,869
An old man that can't defend himself.

1399
01:32:56,080 --> 01:32:57,832
Big tough guy.

1400
01:32:58,000 --> 01:32:59,274
Yeah, that's right.

1401
01:33:00,840 --> 01:33:02,990
Big tough guy.

1402
01:33:16,160 --> 01:33:21,109
<i>I prefer Genaros, but what do I know?
I'm a bear. I suck the heads off fish.</i>

1403
01:33:29,160 --> 01:33:32,789
That's it. That's the true story
of what happened last Christmas.

1404
01:33:32,960 --> 01:33:36,475
That was some pretty harsh shit
with the old guy back there, right?

1405
01:33:36,640 --> 01:33:39,473
But whatever, he's creepy.
Fuck him. Don't worry about him.

1406
01:33:39,640 --> 01:33:41,710
Anyhow, so....

1407
01:33:41,880 --> 01:33:43,518
Thanks for coming.

1408
01:33:43,680 --> 01:33:47,070
Thanks for taking the trip to L.A.
with me.

1409
01:33:48,120 --> 01:33:49,951
If I had to sum it up,
and I do-

1410
01:33:50,120 --> 01:33:52,429
Because, you know,
it's, like, the end.

1411
01:33:52,600 --> 01:33:56,912
-I would say that this movie is about-
It's about friendship.

1412
01:33:57,080 --> 01:33:59,196
-Friendship is sacred.
-What are you doing?

1413
01:33:59,360 --> 01:34:00,998
I'm trying to wrap up the movie...

1414
01:34:01,160 --> 01:34:03,355
...and leave the people
with a message.

1415
01:34:04,200 --> 01:34:07,158
I've got a message for you.
Get your feet off my fucking desk.

1416
01:34:07,320 --> 01:34:09,311
Sorry. I work for Perry now.

1417
01:34:09,480 --> 01:34:11,118
-And stop narrating.
-Obviously.

1418
01:34:11,280 --> 01:34:13,555
That's it.
Please stay for the end credits.

1419
01:34:13,720 --> 01:34:16,951
If you're wondering who the best boy is,
it's someone's nephew.

1420
01:34:17,120 --> 01:34:18,917
Don't forget to validate your parking.

1421
01:34:19,080 --> 01:34:21,196
For all of you good people
in the Midwest...

1422
01:34:21,360 --> 01:34:22,873
...sorry we said "fuck" so much.

1423
01:34:23,040 --> 01:34:24,758
-Say good night.
-Thanks again.

1424
01:34:24,920 --> 01:34:26,672
Now, go. Vanish.

1425
01:38:22,640 --> 01:38:24,631
