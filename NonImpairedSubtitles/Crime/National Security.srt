The man's talking to you.

462
00:31:49,329 --> 00:31:50,523
Yep.

463
00:31:51,249 --> 00:31:54,559
And you were saying?
I was...

464
00:31:54,969 --> 00:31:57,722
saying I was sorry.

465
00:31:58,769 --> 00:32:02,557
For what?
Beating you.

466
00:32:05,329 --> 00:32:09,766
Yeah, my dog. That's what
I'm talking about, man.

467
00:32:11,649 --> 00:32:17,167
Hank was right in the middle
of this very touching apology

468
00:32:17,329 --> 00:32:20,321
when I discovered that my
warehouse was being robbed.

469
00:32:20,489 --> 00:32:24,528
So Hank and I, we banded
together to apprehend
these outlaws.

470
00:32:24,689 --> 00:32:28,682
And we would've
had them, had not your
boys come along.

471
00:32:28,849 --> 00:32:30,282
Excuse me?

472
00:32:30,449 --> 00:32:34,124
Deputy Droop-a-long.
Man, they stopped the wrong car.

473
00:32:34,369 --> 00:32:37,167
You better watch your mouth.
What you gonna do?

474
00:32:37,329 --> 00:32:41,038
Beat the hell out of me?
Probably blame it on a damn spider.

475
00:32:41,209 --> 00:32:43,086
What you got?
The updated report.

476
00:32:43,249 --> 00:32:45,604
We got a 4-59 at the warehouse,
but nothing on a van.

477
00:32:46,089 --> 00:32:47,602
Coroner has two bodies.

478
00:32:47,809 --> 00:32:50,767
DA says self-defence.
So we kick them loose.

479
00:32:51,489 --> 00:32:55,402
The C and L warehouse on 18th?
Yeah.

480
00:32:56,929 --> 00:32:59,762
Not a cop anymore, Hank,
so stop acting like one.

481
00:32:59,929 --> 00:33:04,207
I'm all too happy to find
any reason to lock your
ass up. You understand?

482
00:33:04,409 --> 00:33:07,765
Go find McDuff, tell him
I want to see him right away.

483
00:33:08,569 --> 00:33:12,881
Oh, yeah, we also encountered
a naked girl upstairs,
handcuffed to a light fixture.

484
00:33:13,249 --> 00:33:15,968
Oh, Lo... Lola.

485
00:33:16,849 --> 00:33:20,205
Do you think you could
hook a brother up with
another restraining order?

486
00:33:20,529 --> 00:33:23,965
Right there, because
I recognize them. Great.

487
00:33:25,089 --> 00:33:27,159
All my stuff should
be in here too.

488
00:33:29,649 --> 00:33:31,367
What's up?

489
00:33:32,009 --> 00:33:33,124
Right.

490
00:33:36,369 --> 00:33:38,929
I don't believe this.
Where's my bullets?

491
00:33:39,089 --> 00:33:41,478
We don't return live ammunition.

492
00:33:41,649 --> 00:33:44,686
Well, if you're gonna keep
the bullets, why don't you
just keep the gun.

493
00:33:44,849 --> 00:33:47,488
All right.
Give me my gun, man.

494
00:33:47,889 --> 00:33:49,481
Where's my car?

495
00:33:49,809 --> 00:33:54,803
lmpound lot. Twenty blocks up,
seven blocks over.

496
00:33:55,409 --> 00:33:57,718
You expect that man to walk...?

497

Y'all got a shuttle bus?
You know what?

You upset my partner.
I should set it off up in this...

Hank, you believe
his attitude, man?

501

Man, they probably gonna give
you your car back with no tires.

502
00:34:16,489 --> 00:34:18,525
I like the way you
played it back there, Hank.

503
00:34:18,689 --> 00:34:21,442
Yeah, not letting them in on
our case. That was smooth.

504
00:34:21,609 --> 00:34:24,169
This is our bust, right, partner?
Get the hell away from me!

505
00:34:24,329 --> 00:34:26,240
Hey, Hank! You know what?

506
00:34:26,409 --> 00:34:30,288
Sooner or later, your
hostility is officially gonna
start affecting our work.

507
00:34:30,449 --> 00:34:32,758
Now, look, man.
All you got to do is kind of...

508
00:34:32,929 --> 00:34:35,204
What is you running for?
I'm trying to talk to you.

509
00:34:35,369 --> 00:34:38,327
Look! I am trying
to remain calm,

510
00:34:38,489 --> 00:34:41,481
because I know that if I hit you,
I will never see the light of day again.

511
00:34:41,649 --> 00:34:44,686
Which right now seems almost
worth it. So don't push it!

Yeah! Yeah, I'm threatening you!

a white van that you rented out.

No, I don't know their names.

I guess.

The way I see it, they got
a 20-minute head start.

535
00:35:51,729 --> 00:35:53,287

heading down the 405.

back at Washington's office?

Wanna know what I saw?
What?

On one of them papers,
it said, "CIA heist."
