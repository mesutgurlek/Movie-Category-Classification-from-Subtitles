1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,919
You need to leave us alone!
You need to go away!

2
00:00:03,919 --> 00:00:06,318
- She's drinking, isn't she?
- That's why I rang you.

3
00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:08,159
I don't know why
she's started again.

4
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:09,439
I knew Vicky Fleming.

5
00:00:09,439 --> 00:00:12,599
- Don't you think you should
tell the police?
- You don't know what that does to me.

6
00:00:12,599 --> 00:00:16,278
I'm arresting you on suspicion
of the murder of Ana Vasalescu,

7
00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:17,678
Aurelija Petrovic...

8
00:00:17,679 --> 00:00:19,359
♪ Happy birthday to you! ♪

9
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:21,599
- Who's it from?
- It's from your dad.

10
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:24,199
He wants you and me shouting!
He wants you to hate me!

11
00:00:24,199 --> 00:00:27,359
When has doing anything legally
got anybody like me anywhere?

12
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:30,039
You're going to have to do what
I've asked you to do.

13
00:00:34,679 --> 00:00:36,918
That's wonderful!

14
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:43,759
Every day was a misogynistic delight
from start to finish.

15
00:00:43,759 --> 00:00:46,079
The best thing when I joined up -

16
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:49,319
this is like 300 years ago,
in the 1980s -

17
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:52,759
you didn't get a truncheon
if you were a woman,

18
00:00:52,759 --> 00:00:54,158
you got a handbag!

19
00:00:54,159 --> 00:00:57,238
- Thanks(!)
- No, you did get a
truncheon. You got one of them,

20
00:00:57,240 --> 00:00:59,518
you know, little doodah things.

21
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:00,719
That's right, yeah!

22
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:05,679
Like a vibrator. A handbag
and a vibrator. Great!

23
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:07,198
What you gonna do with that

24
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:10,319
when someone's coming at you with
an Uzi and a machete?

25
00:01:10,319 --> 00:01:13,319
They were big enough to keep
a brick in, them handbags.

26
00:01:13,319 --> 00:01:16,599
- Just!
- So, you were a police officer?

27
00:01:16,599 --> 00:01:20,359
I was, yeah. 30 years and
then I come back as a civvy.

28
00:01:20,359 --> 00:01:21,918
God knows why.

29
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:24,039
Well...

30
00:01:24,039 --> 00:01:26,638
God does know why.

31
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:29,359
And skirts. There were no trousers.

32
00:01:29,359 --> 00:01:31,079
You don't know you're born, you lot.

33
00:01:31,079 --> 00:01:33,998
We used to freeze our knackers
off on a night shift.

34
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,718
Ooh, and do you remember,
"Stockings or tights?"

35
00:01:38,719 --> 00:01:41,759
You'd run the gauntlet every time
you walked through t'CID office.

36
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:43,478
They'd have their hands up
your skirts,

37
00:01:43,479 --> 00:01:46,679
twanging your suspenders to see
if you were sharp or flat.

38
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:48,838
And you just took it!

39
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:49,959
You had to.

40
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:53,838
Although. Although. Leonard Stott.

41
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:55,918
Inspector up at Brighouse.

42
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:58,759
He used to come up to me,
every time he saw me,

43
00:01:58,759 --> 00:02:01,519
he used to come up to me like this.

44
00:02:01,519 --> 00:02:04,759
"Oooh, Cathy!" He used to call me
Cathy. "It's Catherine, you twat."

45
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:09,278
"Oooh, Cathy," and I was like,
"Whatever," for long enough

46
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:12,718
and then one day, I just thought,
"Bollocks to this,"

47
00:02:12,719 --> 00:02:15,759
and the next time he did it...
Right in his face

48
00:02:15,759 --> 00:02:17,438
and I floored him. I decked him

49
00:02:17,439 --> 00:02:20,359
and I'd only been out of
training school four weeks,

50
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:21,959
but he never did it again.

51
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:24,718
- In fact, he used to avoid me
after that.
- No shit.

52
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:28,959
We're doing tequilas, us lot.
You joining us?

53
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:31,120
- Yes!
- Yeah! Yeah!

54
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:34,878
You go home if you're knackered.

55
00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:37,599
Nah, I promised Nev
I'd look out for her.

56
00:02:38,719 --> 00:02:40,360
Has she said owt?

57
00:02:42,479 --> 00:02:44,679
She's bereaved!

58
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:46,520
It's been what, four weeks?

59
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,520
It's the sort of thing you can
appear to be coping and then...

60
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:01,718
Best thing we can do is show her
we care and keep an eye on her.

61
00:03:05,719 --> 00:03:07,000
Where is she?

62
00:03:17,319 --> 00:03:19,920
- Not here!
- Why?

63
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,478
Are you sure about this?

64
00:03:44,479 --> 00:03:45,918
Yeah. Honestly.

65
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:49,639
You can have my bed. I'm still
camped out in the conservatory.

66
00:03:57,520 --> 00:04:01,479
- You're such a fantastic human being,
Catherine.
- I know.

67
00:04:01,479 --> 00:04:07,199
I know I'm pissed, but do you know
what I think God is?

68
00:04:07,199 --> 00:04:11,199
I think... God... is like this...

69
00:04:11,199 --> 00:04:14,560
this collective goodness
that's in all of us.
- Yeah.

70
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:18,918
Yeah.

71
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:21,199
And someone like you...

72
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:26,399
it's like you have so much of this
goodness, this...

73
00:04:26,399 --> 00:04:27,720
bigness.

74
00:04:29,319 --> 00:04:33,800
It's like you embody what... God is.

75
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:41,120
OK. Now then.

76
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:45,600
- Ann.
- Hm.

77
00:04:47,519 --> 00:04:49,759
Did you...

78
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:53,119
shag... that bloke?

79
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:55,079
Yeah.

80
00:04:56,199 --> 00:04:57,319
Did I?

81
00:04:59,279 --> 00:05:03,240
Did he use... a condom?

82
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,879
- Mm.
- Are you on the pill
or anything?

83
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:11,519
I can see two of you.

84
00:05:13,879 --> 00:05:17,160
Omnipotent and ubiquitous.

85
00:05:18,399 --> 00:05:20,079

94
00:06:41,879 --> 00:06:44,079
Right, Sean. Last time we saw you...

95
00:06:44,079 --> 00:06:46,639
Last time we met,
we had a conversation...

96
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:49,920
Before we start...
there's something I want to say.

97
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:56,158
That's absolutely fine, Sean.
What would you like to say?

98
00:06:56,159 --> 00:06:59,038
There's two questions you've asked
me that I've said no comment to

99
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:00,358
and I want to comment now.

100
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:02,358
And then there's something else
I want to say.

101
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:03,639
OK.

102
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:08,038
You asked me...

103
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:11,999
what I'd say if you told me
you'd found some...

104
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,038
somebody's DNA in my van.

105
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:15,399
Ana Vasalescu.

106
00:07:15,399 --> 00:07:17,079
Well, I don't know her, but...

107
00:07:19,519 --> 00:07:21,439
...if she's a prostitute...

108
00:07:21,439 --> 00:07:24,598
I do... pick 'em up now and again,
and she could've been one of them...

109
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:26,238
'..and that's the only reason

110
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:28,639
- 'I can think of as to why it'd be
there.
- Good. Well, '

111
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:31,918
- thank you for that, Sean.
That's helpful.
- And then...

112
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:36,199
And then there's th-that other
one's number in my phone.

113
00:07:36,199 --> 00:07:38,079
- Lynn, er...
- Lynn Dewhurst.

114
00:07:38,079 --> 00:07:39,480
I don't know her.

115
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:41,759
As such.

116
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:45,319
I think...

117
00:07:45,319 --> 00:07:47,558
I think I helped shift some
furniture for her

118
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:49,199
a couple of years ago as a favour.

119
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:51,678
She was a friend of a friend
and I had a van, so...

120
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,159
I didn't know her!

121
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:56,158
But...

122
00:07:56,159 --> 00:07:59,038
I don't remember doing, but maybe
I just took her number in case

123
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:02,358
there were any problems, I couldn't
find the house or whatever, and then

124
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:04,999
- I never deleted it, cos I never
delete numbers, do you?
- No.

125
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,358
So who's this friend you were
doing the favour for?

126
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:11,838
I ain't seen him lately.
He was called Eggy.

127
00:08:11,839 --> 00:08:13,399
Has he got an address?

128
00:08:13,399 --> 00:08:15,639
He won't be there now,
it's all derelict.

129
00:08:15,639 --> 00:08:18,399
- What's his proper name?
- I only ever knew him as Eggy.

130
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:21,559
Right.

131
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:24,838
And where were you shifting
this furniture to and from?

132
00:08:24,839 --> 00:08:28,918
Somewhere up... Pellon,
from a flat in Halifax.

133
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:30,918
Can you remember a street name,
where she lived?

134
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:32,759
I don't know round there.

135
00:08:32,759 --> 00:08:36,198
- What type of property was it?
- A terrace.

136
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:37,519
Describe it to me.

137
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:39,759
It was just ordinary.
It's been three years since.

138
00:08:39,759 --> 00:08:41,759
So you don't remember
a house number?

139
00:08:41,759 --> 00:08:43,838
It was just a settee
and an armchair!

140
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:45,959
It were only ten minutes of a job,
about three f...

141
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:54,759
About three years ago.

142
00:08:59,879 --> 00:09:03,000
So what's this other thing you
wanted to say to me, then, Sean?

143
00:09:11,159 --> 00:09:15,798
I'm worried that...
because I drink a lot,

144
00:09:15,799 --> 00:09:18,039
I don't always remember stuff
what's happened...

145
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:22,918
...and I-I don't believe that
I did kill those women...

146
00:09:22,919 --> 00:09:25,599
but perhaps I've got...

147
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:28,479
perhaps I've got so drunk that
I've done stuff and...

148
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:30,399
and I-I don't remember doing it.

149
00:09:33,399 --> 00:09:35,879
- 'Look, I'm just trying to be
as honest with you as I can be.

150
00:09:35,879 --> 00:09:39,463
'I'm pretty sure something like that
you would remember,
however off your head you was.'

151
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:48,240
But if it... if it was me...

152
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:52,240
...I honestly have no memory of it.

153
00:09:56,799 --> 00:10:00,279
You do realise that isn't a defence
though, don't you, Sean?

154
00:10:03,919 --> 00:10:04,960
Yeah.

155
00:10:13,679 --> 00:10:15,719
Yeah, the problem is, Sod's Law,

156
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:18,038
the night I decide not to
sleep in the conservatory,

157
00:10:18,039 --> 00:10:20,558
- something will happen.
- If them
Knezevics were going to do owt,

158
00:10:20,559 --> 00:10:24,318
- wouldn't they have done it by now?
- Probably. Possibly.

159
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:27,519
That Goran bloke must've known
stuff Ilinka didn't know.

160
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:29,438
That must be why
they went after him.

161
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:32,438
Or else, they genuinely have
no idea where she is.

162
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:34,639
How did you work that out?

163
00:10:34,639 --> 00:10:37,078
Because - duh! -
that's what you said.

164
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:39,719
Oh, OK. Well, yeah. Yeah.

165
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:42,158
I think you just like sleeping
in t'conservatory.

166
00:10:42,159 --> 00:10:45,399
Yeah, but, you see, now I'm
thinking, never mind the Knezevics,

167
00:10:45,399 --> 00:10:48,278
now I'm thinking that whoever left
that Scalextric is going to do

168
00:10:48,279 --> 00:10:50,918
something else,
something even more weird.

169
00:10:50,919 --> 00:10:52,158
Like what?

170
00:10:52,159 --> 00:10:53,999
I don't know. A brick through
a window.

171
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,798
You see, I don't think a brick
through the window is as weird

172
00:10:56,799 --> 00:10:58,999
as leaving a present on your
doorstep, actually.

173
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,119
And I don't think somebody
who'd leave a present

174
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:04,318
on your doorstep would put a brick
through your window anyway, so...

175
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:07,999
Yeah. No. Why?

176
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,359
It wasn't an act of aggression.

177
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:12,839
Oh, it was psychologically
aggressive.

178
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:16,639
- Yeah, but not violent,
just weird.
- Yeah.

179
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:20,158
Right!

180
00:11:20,159 --> 00:11:23,198
I'm gonna grab some clothes
and get dressed, and then...

181
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:26,399
Morning, Mother!
Late night, was it?

182
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:29,838
Hiya. Then I'm going to... Yes, it
was. And then I'm going to go

183
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:33,198
and spend 150 quid that I haven't
got on the famous bloody toy

184
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:36,639
that Ryan never asked for
in the first place.

185
00:11:36,639 --> 00:11:38,798
I must need my head examined.

186
00:11:38,799 --> 00:11:41,639
We've been saying this for years
behind your back. Haven't we, Clare?

187
00:11:43,159 --> 00:11:45,078
Ann Gallagher's upstairs,
just to warn you.

188
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:46,999
Why, is she dangerous?

189
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,039
Funny(!) You're so funny, Daniel(!)

190
00:11:54,039 --> 00:11:57,158
That solicitor wasn't happy,
was he? Did you see him?

191
00:11:59,799 --> 00:12:01,600
He stuck by him, though.

192
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:05,798
Did you believe him?
What he said about Lynn?

193
00:12:05,799 --> 00:12:08,119
Well, it fits. Her number's there on
his phone,

194
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:11,080
but it's not like there's
ever been any calls between them.

195
00:12:12,559 --> 00:12:15,120
Doesn't prove anything
though, does it?

196
00:12:16,159 --> 00:12:19,438
I still think that last one's
different.

197
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:20,720
Vicky Fleming.

198
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,639
OK.

199
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:29,078
CPS says go for it. Charge him.

200
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:31,558
- All four?
- We've got significant
circumstantial, he's on

201
00:12:31,559 --> 00:12:34,719
the sex offenders' register, he was
practically caught red-handed with

202
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:37,158
Leonie Farrell, and now he's talking
to us he's telling us

203
00:12:37,159 --> 00:12:39,479
he's got no memory of anything
and no alibis.

204
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:42,399
And they're saying that's good
enough for them to go to court with,

205
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:44,239
so...

206
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:46,798
looks like we might get
a bit of a weekend after all.

207
00:12:46,799 --> 00:12:49,279
So all four,
including Vicky Fleming?

208
00:12:50,799 --> 00:12:52,320
All four.

209
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:57,440
Well done... team.

210
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:09,438
I've got to caution you again now,
Sean, and tell you that you do not

211
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:12,558
have to say anything, but it may
harm your defence if you do not

212
00:13:12,559 --> 00:13:15,399
mention now something which you
later rely on in court.

213
00:13:15,399 --> 00:13:18,120
Anything you do say may be
given in evidence.

214
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:25,798
You are charged that, on or between
27th of April and 29th of April 2015

215
00:13:25,799 --> 00:13:31,278
- at Elland, murdered Ana Vasalescu
contrary to common law.
- I didn't...

216
00:13:31,279 --> 00:13:35,719
On or between 29th of May and
2nd of June 2015 at Brighouse,

217
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:39,558
murdered Aurelija Petrovic
contrary to common law.

218
00:13:39,559 --> 00:13:44,239
On or between 23rd of July and
6th of August 2015 at Halifax,

219
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:48,359
murdered Lynn Dewhurst
contrary to common law.

220
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:52,278
On or between 11th of September
and 15th of September 2015

221
00:13:52,279 --> 00:13:56,799
at Brighouse, murdered Victoria
Fleming contrary to common law.

222
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:00,479
Is there anything you want
to say, Sean?

223
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:02,919
I didn't do it.

224
00:14:09,039 --> 00:14:11,799
149.99, please.

225
00:14:21,279 --> 00:14:23,320
Do you sell many of these?

226
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:06,519
We have met before. It was me
mother's birthday, year before last.

227
00:15:06,519 --> 00:15:07,999
Do you remember?

228
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,798
I got a bit pissed
and went off in a strop.

229
00:15:10,799 --> 00:15:12,278
Yeah, yeah.

230
00:15:12,279 --> 00:15:15,440
So you...? You and your wife,
you've... split?

231
00:15:16,559 --> 00:15:19,200
Yeah. It's all a bit mad.

232
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:24,240
Life is a bit mad though, isn't it?
Older you get.

233
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:27,879
I think...

234
00:15:27,879 --> 00:15:32,959
looking back, I only married Lucy
to get away from here.

235
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:35,399
I liked her. Y'know.

236
00:15:35,399 --> 00:15:38,119
I do like her.

237
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:41,840
But everything has to be so neat and
tidy and nothing out of place.

238
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:45,559
It's like living in a little
dolly house.

239
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:49,759
Is that cos of what
happened with Becky?

240
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:51,679
Wanting to get away from here?

241
00:15:53,799 --> 00:15:54,840
It was an odd time.

242
00:15:55,879 --> 00:15:57,519
After she died. Becky.

243
00:16:00,159 --> 00:16:01,600
Me mum did go a bit mental.

244
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:05,759
Me dad couldn't stand it either.
He left.

245
00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:06,840
How old were you?

246
00:16:07,879 --> 00:16:11,720
20. She said some really stupid
things.

247
00:16:14,559 --> 00:16:16,200
But, you know, she was ill.

248
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:21,840
I think she's fantast...

249
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:25,360
Oh, God.

250
00:16:26,519 --> 00:16:27,879
What?

251
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:33,840
I just remembered something
I said last night, to her.

252
00:16:38,879 --> 00:16:40,200
Moving on...

253
00:16:41,639 --> 00:16:44,159
How was last night?
Did it do the trick?

254
00:16:45,639 --> 00:16:46,679
What trick?

255
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:49,278
Cheer you up.

256
00:16:49,279 --> 00:16:51,318
Cheer ME up?

257
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:52,399
Yeah.

258
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,318
Have I put me foot in it?

259
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:57,399
The bastards!

260
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:00,759
You OK?

261
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:11,319
It was silly what upset me. I
haven't told anyone. It was at work.

262
00:17:12,839 --> 00:17:17,118
This... bloke asked me out for a
drink. A detective.

263
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:19,278
Nothing special,
old enough to be me dad,

264
00:17:19,279 --> 00:17:23,759
and I knew he was married and been
having an affair with someone else.

265
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:27,839
But I quite liked him.

266
00:17:30,079 --> 00:17:34,439
It was the first time I'd thought
about... the possibility of...

267
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:35,759
you know.

268
00:17:37,519 --> 00:17:38,920
Being close to someone.

269
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:42,160
Since what happened to me.

270
00:17:44,759 --> 00:17:47,079
So it was a big deal.
Not that he knew that.

271
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:49,440
Then...

272
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:53,680
...he didn't turn up.

273
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:55,759
So...

274
00:17:57,759 --> 00:17:58,920
Tosser.

275
00:18:01,279 --> 00:18:02,680
Yeah.

So! Hello. Good morning!

290
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:00,680
How are we all?

291
00:19:02,279 --> 00:19:03,679
Good(!)

292
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:06,638
So I've got a little proposal
I'd like to put to you.

293
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:08,398
Contrary to what you think,

294
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:11,318
I'm not the one who's been having
some sort of sordid little fling

295
00:19:11,319 --> 00:19:15,719
with some sad sod from Mirfield who
drives a Skoda - no, that'll be you.

296
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:18,638
So what I'm proposing is,
YOU move out,

297
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:21,719
you gather your bits and pieces,
you move in with loverboy,

298
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:23,679
you feel free
to do whatever you have to do.

299
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:27,118
I - me - the one who hasn't been
mucking about -

300
00:19:27,119 --> 00:19:31,358
will stay here, in our house, with
our children. How about that?

301
00:19:31,359 --> 00:19:32,798
I'm not leaving the children.

302
00:19:32,799 --> 00:19:34,638
Yeah. Well, newsflash.
Neither am I.

303
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:37,358
And you're a liar. I know damn
well you've been up to something.

304
00:19:37,359 --> 00:19:41,638
OK, then. Who is this mysterious
whoever who I've been having this
relationship with, then? Eh?

305
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:46,358
Where is she? Eh? She doesn't exist,
Amanda. She's in your head!

306
00:19:46,359 --> 00:19:52,118
And you really should get your facts
straight before you start
accusing people of things.

307
00:19:52,119 --> 00:19:55,719
Now go and pack your stuff and ring
Casanova. He'll be thrilled!

308
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:59,519
You can set up home together.
That's the plan, isn't it?

309
00:19:59,519 --> 00:20:01,679
I assume that's the plan.

310
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:03,439
Does Graham know that's the plan?

311
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:04,798
Shut up!

312
00:20:04,799 --> 00:20:06,318
Oh! Does he not?

313
00:20:08,599 --> 00:20:10,999
Oh, does he not?

314
00:20:13,039 --> 00:20:16,838
Can we talk about this sensibly,
properly,

315
00:20:16,839 --> 00:20:19,038
not in front of the children?

316
00:20:19,039 --> 00:20:21,078
Perhaps I should go
and tell him, then.

317
00:20:21,079 --> 00:20:23,159
Perhaps I should keep him informed.

318
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:25,558
Perhaps I should knock his
teeth down his throat.

319
00:20:25,559 --> 00:20:26,638
Where you going?

320
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:27,719
Mirfield.

321
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:29,038
You don't know where he lives.

322
00:20:29,039 --> 00:20:31,439
I'm a detective, love.
I know bloody well where he lives.

323
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:34,318
Feel free to ring ahead and warn him
that I'm on my way.

324
00:20:34,319 --> 00:20:37,798
If he's not in when I get there,
I'll ask his wife to pass on a
message. How about that?

325
00:20:37,799 --> 00:20:40,159
No. Don't do that! John! Don't!

326
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:42,519
What, does she not know either?

327
00:20:43,519 --> 00:20:48,919
So it's just you that thinks the
two of you's slinking off into the
sunset together, is it?

328
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:50,479
I shan't be long, kids.

329
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:51,558
Dad!

330
00:20:51,559 --> 00:20:53,240
Shan't be long, tiddler!

331
00:20:54,839 --> 00:20:55,999
Why did you let him in?

332
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,638
It's his house too, he lives here
as well!

333
00:20:58,640 --> 00:20:59,680
Shit!

334
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:09,439
How many seconds?

335
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:10,838
I didn't even bother to count.

336
00:21:10,839 --> 00:21:13,159
You're supposed to count!

337
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:15,398
- Two and a half?
- It was nearly a minute!

338
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:16,598
And the rest!

339
00:21:16,599 --> 00:21:18,200
I'll have to do it again now.

340
00:21:19,759 --> 00:21:20,838
Good morning!

341
00:21:20,839 --> 00:21:21,999
Granny!

342
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,118
Hi!

343
00:21:23,119 --> 00:21:25,398
Count how long I can balance!

344
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:26,759
Did you sleep all right?

345
00:21:26,759 --> 00:21:29,078
- Granny!
- Yeah, yeah. Thanks. Sorry.

346
00:21:29,079 --> 00:21:31,479
I'll drive you home in a bit.
Have you had some breakfast?

347
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:32,720
Just had some coffee.

348
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:39,159
Well, I got it. 149.99.

349
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:40,440
I don't want it.

350
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:45,038
What are you talking about?

351
00:21:45,039 --> 00:21:46,439
I'll have it!

352
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:47,919
What d'you mean, you don't want it?

353
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:50,318
- I mean, I don't want it.
- Why?
- Because it's not the same.

354
00:21:50,319 --> 00:21:52,999
It's exactly the same. Only
we know where this one's come from.

355
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,078
I wanted that other one.

356
00:21:54,079 --> 00:21:57,078
Well, you couldn't have that other
one, and I promised I'd replace it.

357
00:21:57,079 --> 00:21:58,359
I wanted the one me dad sent.

358
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:06,278
He's not your dad.
I've explained this.

359
00:22:06,279 --> 00:22:07,558
Yeah. But he is.

360
00:22:07,559 --> 00:22:09,078
Why don't I go and set it up?

361
00:22:09,079 --> 00:22:11,318
And you go ring Cesco to come round
and have a race.

362
00:22:11,319 --> 00:22:12,598
We'll have a championship.

363
00:22:12,599 --> 00:22:13,638
No.

364
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:14,759
I'll set it up.

365
00:22:14,759 --> 00:22:17,278
No, if he's not going to play with
it, I'll get my money back.

366
00:22:17,279 --> 00:22:19,599
- He'll play with it.
- I shan't.

367
00:22:46,519 --> 00:22:47,919
Sorry.

368
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:49,118
It's fine.

369
00:22:49,119 --> 00:22:51,239
Oh, it's ridiculous.
It's impossible.

370
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:53,199
You need to find out who
put it there.

371
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:54,358
I will, I'm going to.

372
00:22:54,359 --> 00:22:55,479
Bastard.

373
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:57,160
Don't get me started.

374
00:23:01,119 --> 00:23:03,479
I'm sorry
if I was talking shite last night.

375
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:05,400
No, you weren't. You were happy.

376
00:23:07,559 --> 00:23:11,078
Oh, I got you this.
From the chemist.

377
00:23:11,079 --> 00:23:12,278
What is it?

378
00:23:12,279 --> 00:23:13,440
Morning after pill.

379
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,118
Oh, Jesus.

380
00:23:16,119 --> 00:23:19,719
I mean, I don't know that you need
it, I don't know what you did,
but I just thought...

381
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:20,798
Thanks.

382
00:23:20,799 --> 00:23:21,959
- You know.
- Yeah.

383
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:24,159
- Just in case.
- How much do I owe you?

384
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:28,318
It's fine, it's nothing, it's a
present. Except you do know,
just for future reference,

385
00:23:28,319 --> 00:23:31,719
if anyone'd seen you, it would've
been a Public Order offence
at the very least,

386
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:33,759
and you'd have lost your job.

387
00:23:35,599 --> 00:23:36,839
Shit, can you answer that?

388
00:23:41,759 --> 00:23:45,959
Hello, Catherine's phone? She's
driving, she's just dropping me
home.

389
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:48,479
Yeah, all right, bye.

390
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:51,598
She says, can you pop up to the
allotment after you've
dropped me off?

391
00:23:51,599 --> 00:23:53,000
Deep joy(!)

392
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:10,278
So what's up?

393
00:24:10,279 --> 00:24:16,878
Well, I've been expecting Neil all
morning but he's not shown up.

394
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:19,318
I knocked on his door on my way
down, no answer,

395
00:24:19,319 --> 00:24:21,479
I've phoned him,
I've texted him, nothing.

396
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:24,078
And it's odd cos
we were reckoning to spend

397
00:24:24,079 --> 00:24:25,638
the day on the allotment together.

398
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:26,878
He'll have forgotten.

399
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:28,118
It's not like him.

400
00:24:28,119 --> 00:24:30,239
- I wouldn't know.
- Why don't you like him?

401
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:32,278
It's only lunchtime.

402
00:24:32,279 --> 00:24:34,798
He's a really nice man.

403
00:24:34,799 --> 00:24:36,038
So what wants doing?

404
00:24:36,039 --> 00:24:37,719
I've got all these planks to shift.

405
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:39,318
Jerry at far end said
he'd have 'em.

406
00:24:39,319 --> 00:24:41,679
Well, can't Jerry at far end come
and fetch 'em?

407
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:43,079
He's in hospital.

408
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:48,599
Hey. They've charged that fella.

409
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:52,959
Sean Balmforth. This morning.
It's been on t'radio.

410
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:55,159
They've charged him wi' them
murders.

411
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:56,398
Wow.

412
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:57,960
I know.

413
00:25:03,079 --> 00:25:04,798
You all right?

414
00:25:04,799 --> 00:25:07,638
I bought our Ryan that Scalextric
and he reckoned he didn't want it.

415
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:09,159
"I wanted that one me dad sent me."

416
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:11,719
I've said it till I'm blue
in the face, "He's not your dad."

417
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:13,440
And he goes, "Yeah, but he is."

418
00:25:15,079 --> 00:25:16,720
It'll never go away, will it?

419
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:24,078
When I find out which sad, twisted
sod left that on our doorstep...

420
00:25:24,079 --> 00:25:26,480
I'll make
'em wish they'd never been born.

421
00:26:44,519 --> 00:26:47,319
- Nice weekend?
- Yourself?

422
00:26:49,079 --> 00:26:50,638
Have you heard owt from Gravesend?

423
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:53,398
Yes! I did. Late on Friday night,
they sent a list.

424
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:56,999
Visitors, phone calls,
people he writes to.
I can't let you see it.

425
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,159
You being funny?

426
00:26:58,160 --> 00:27:00,638
No. I can't have you taking
the law into your own hands.

427
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:04,999
- What, Friday night and you didn't
let me know?
- I've forwarded the list
to an analyst in the DIU.

428
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,398
He'll gather intel on all of 'em,

429
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:09,199
and as soon as we know anything
significant, I'll get back to you.

430
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:12,599
You know that's the right way
forward, Catherine,
don't start pulling faces.

431
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:17,519
Woman in the toy shop in Hebden
last week buying a Scalextric.

432
00:27:17,519 --> 00:27:19,519
Exactly the same model.

433
00:27:19,519 --> 00:27:23,278
I went in and asked the fella
behind the counter on Saturday
and he showed me his CCTV.

434
00:27:23,279 --> 00:27:24,519
Looks like a lad.

435
00:27:24,519 --> 00:27:26,358
Yeah, well, it's a woman,
the fella said.

436
00:27:26,359 --> 00:27:30,439
- Either way, it doesn't mean it's
whoever it was left it on your
doorstep.
- No, I know that,

437
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:33,118
but was there anyone on the list
from round here?

438
00:27:33,119 --> 00:27:34,838
No.

439
00:27:34,839 --> 00:27:36,159
Not?

440
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:38,279
No. Not from round here.

441
00:27:40,799 --> 00:27:42,838
Are you briefing t'troops?

442
00:27:42,839 --> 00:27:45,759
Yes, I am. Are you saying,
"Well done, Catherine"?

443
00:27:45,759 --> 00:27:46,919
What for this time?

444
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:50,239
Sean Balmforth. Charged.
That was me got him arrested.

445
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:51,878
Oh! Yes, but...

446
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:54,398
They're playing it down
till it's confirmed,

447
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:57,519
but there's another body
turned up in Rastrick.

448
00:27:57,519 --> 00:27:59,199
When?

449
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:01,558
Early hours this morning.

450
00:28:01,559 --> 00:28:03,999
And depending on when she died...

451
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,319
it could mean they've charged
the wrong fella.

452
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:17,318
- Sorry!
- Mornin'.

453
00:28:17,319 --> 00:28:21,759
Oh, congratulations! He's been
charged, you'll have heard.
That fella you tipped us off about.

454
00:28:21,759 --> 00:28:25,439
Oh, have you not heard?
Apparently another body's turned up.

455
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:26,959
Did you not know?

456
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:28,319
It's what I've just been told.

457
00:28:30,839 --> 00:28:32,798
Good morning, you lucky people...

458
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:56,240
(Bollocks.)

459
00:28:57,640 --> 00:28:59,479
Really?

460
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:01,119
(Shit.)

461
00:29:05,359 --> 00:29:08,519
She thinks she's not been dead
more than 48 hours.

462
00:29:08,519 --> 00:29:10,598
She'll be more specific
at the postmortem,

463
00:29:10,599 --> 00:29:13,358
but it's looking like she died after
we had Sean in custody.

464
00:29:13,359 --> 00:29:15,400
- Oh, f...
- I know.

465
00:29:27,559 --> 00:29:28,880
Could it be a copycat?

466
00:29:31,039 --> 00:29:34,519
Well, again, we'll know more
after the PM, but...

467
00:29:42,039 --> 00:29:46,398
So, we'll be getting
the review team in.

468
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:48,959
And to restore public confidence
in the investigation,

469
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:53,359
I'll be getting my arse kicked
down the stairs in the traditional
manner, no doubt, by your dad.

470
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:56,599
I can only apologise.

471
00:30:00,519 --> 00:30:02,000
Who is she?

472
00:30:04,599 --> 00:30:08,119
White. Between 20 and 30.
Poor teeth, poor clothes.

473
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:18,638
You know, the only thing I'd have
done differently from you
on Saturday...

474
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:20,598
I'm sorry, do you want to hear this?

475
00:30:20,599 --> 00:30:23,480
You wouldn't have charged him
with Vicky Fleming.

476
00:30:31,359 --> 00:30:36,200
"'I'm sure that dog's getting
bigger by the minute, ' said Dad.

477
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:39,679
"Ben and Albert laughed.

478
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:41,799
"'If only Dad knew.'"

479
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:47,078
You're doing so well.
Ben and Albert!

480
00:30:47,079 --> 00:30:49,239
They remind me of you and Cesco.

481
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:50,598
How?

482
00:30:50,599 --> 00:30:52,398
Just, you're best friends.

483
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:53,638
Oh, yeah.

484
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:55,719
Do you and Cesco do sleepovers?

485
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:57,558
I used to love sleepovers!

486
00:30:57,559 --> 00:31:00,078
That's the best thing
about a best friend.

487
00:31:00,079 --> 00:31:03,118
- Sometimes we do.
- Yeah? Have you got one planned?

488
00:31:03,119 --> 00:31:04,159
No.

489
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:05,559
Why?

490
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:10,720
How're things at home?

491
00:31:14,359 --> 00:31:17,278
You know, if you ever want to
talk to me,

492
00:31:17,279 --> 00:31:20,079
about anything, Ryan,
you know you can.

493
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:25,159
Other day...

494
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:26,640
at teatime...

495
00:31:27,759 --> 00:31:32,440
...I said I wondered if we should
forgive him - me dad.

496
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:37,638
But they wouldn't talk about it.
They just get cross.

497
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:38,838
Who does?

498
00:31:38,839 --> 00:31:41,159
Me granny. And me Auntie Clare.

499
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:44,959
And I've been worried, because...

500
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:47,919
you know when you said they don't
get much money in prison...?

501
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:49,160
Yeah...

502
00:31:50,519 --> 00:31:52,199
Ryan?

503
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:55,679
Do you think... he gets
enough food to eat?

504
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:59,278
Do you think he's warm enough
at night when it's cold?

505
00:31:59,279 --> 00:32:02,358
Oh, yes, yes, yes! I'm sure he is.

506
00:32:02,359 --> 00:32:04,038
You mustn't worry about that, Ryan!

507
00:32:04,039 --> 00:32:06,118
Oh, you're so sweet and kind
to think about that.

508
00:32:06,119 --> 00:32:09,078
I know he hurt me granny
and everything,

509
00:32:09,079 --> 00:32:12,078
but he's still me dad.

510
00:32:12,079 --> 00:32:16,519
Yeah. I think the worst thing
about prison probably is,

511
00:32:16,519 --> 00:32:19,519
he might get lonely sometimes.

512
00:32:19,519 --> 00:32:20,838
And bored.

513
00:32:20,839 --> 00:32:23,519
Have you ever thought
about visiting him?

514
00:32:23,519 --> 00:32:27,079
I'm not allowed. There's no
contact cos of what he did.

515
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:30,119
I bet he'd love to see you.

516
00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:35,318
I wonder if that's another reason
why he sent you that lovely present?

517
00:32:35,319 --> 00:32:37,199
I wondered...

518
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:39,919
about writing to him.

519
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:42,239
You should.

520
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:44,118
I don't know his address.

521
00:32:44,119 --> 00:32:47,119
Oh, I think you could just
put his name, and then...

522
00:32:48,319 --> 00:32:50,638
Um... Oh, um...

523
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:53,078
Where is he? What prison is he in?

524
00:32:53,079 --> 00:32:55,318
Do you know?

525
00:32:55,319 --> 00:32:58,519
Oh... I think I heard
that he's in, um...

526
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:01,959
...Gravesend Prison.

527
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:03,959
- Gravesend?
- Yeah.

528
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:05,398
Where's that?

529
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:06,799
It's near London.

530
00:33:18,680 --> 00:33:22,118
'Bravo November 4-5. Could you
look at log 271 of today -

531
00:33:22,119 --> 00:33:23,719
'down in Sowerby Bridge?

532
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:26,159
'There's a fella kicking off
outside The Moorings.'

533
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:28,878
I can look at it, Mr Metcalfe,
but I've got no-one to deploy.

534
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:32,398
They're all off on the
house-to-house with this body
that's turned up in Rastrick.

535
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:34,398
'It's all started with
a plate of chips,

536
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:36,200
'and it's escalated from there.

537
00:33:37,279 --> 00:33:41,159
'I don't suppose I could persuade
you to turn out yourself, 4-5?'

538
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:43,199
Well, I was just about to make
myself a cup of tea

539
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:46,159
and put my feet up for the
afternoon, but seeing as it's you...

540
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:48,598
'So he's been ejected from
the premises, we've got

541
00:33:48,599 --> 00:33:51,598
'CCTV monitoring him now, he's
in the street with his top off,

542
00:33:51,599 --> 00:33:53,919
'banging on the doors,
trying to get back in.'

543
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:57,638
Oh, lovely - a semi-naked man
at lunchtime in Sowerby Bridge,

544
00:33:57,640 --> 00:33:59,359
how could I stay away?

545
00:34:08,920 --> 00:34:10,639
Get out here, you little runt!

546
00:34:10,639 --> 00:34:12,318
Come on, get out here!

547
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:13,998
You TWAT!

548
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,478
Come on, you short-arsed bastard!

549
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:18,358
Open this door!

550
00:34:18,360 --> 00:34:20,438
Hey!

551
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:21,599
Neil?

552
00:34:22,599 --> 00:34:24,438
Where've you been?

553
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:26,159
What you doing here?

554
00:34:26,159 --> 00:34:27,559
Bravo November 4-5.

555
00:34:27,559 --> 00:34:30,438
I'm code six, I don't need any
backup, I know this fella.

556
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:33,318
Oh, you won't need any backup?
Is that what you think?

557
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:36,478
Well, you're not going to cause me
any problems, are you, Neil?

558
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:39,318
I was just explaining
to this tosser...

559
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:40,998
Open the fucking door!

560
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,318
Can you calm down?

561
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:45,079
Make 'im open the door.

562
00:34:45,079 --> 00:34:48,039
You're causing a disturbance
and you're upsetting people.

563
00:34:48,039 --> 00:34:50,599
- Where's your top?
- No, I'm not!

564
00:34:52,119 --> 00:34:54,438
Rat-face! Open this door!

565
00:34:54,440 --> 00:34:57,199
If you don't calm down, I'm warning
you, you'll get locked up.

566
00:34:57,199 --> 00:34:59,838
Do you understand?
I've warned you now, Neil.

567
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:02,838
Can you get your jumper back on
for me, please?

568
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:04,478
They've got me telephone.

569
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:06,159
Who's got your telephone?

570
00:35:06,159 --> 00:35:08,478
THEM! In there!

571
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:11,759
Is that your telephone
on the pavement, over there?

572
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:13,159
Eh?

573
00:35:13,159 --> 00:35:14,280
Down there.

574
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:20,320
- Oh.
- Can you pick it up for me?

575
00:35:25,639 --> 00:35:28,039
Is that your telephone?

576
00:35:28,039 --> 00:35:30,798
- Is that your telephone, Neil?
- YES!

577
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:33,838
He's been in here stealing food
off people's plates.

578
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:36,119
You bloody liar.
Why would I do that?

579
00:35:36,119 --> 00:35:39,318
People don't want your dirty great
fingers in their chips!

580
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:42,159
It was a bit o' fun!
It was her birthday!

581
00:35:42,159 --> 00:35:44,719
I've asked him to leave,
I've made it clear

582
00:35:44,719 --> 00:35:47,518
he wasn't gonna be served any more,
and he just won't clear off.

583
00:35:47,519 --> 00:35:49,478
- I'm dealing with it.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah...

584
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:52,838
- And you can tell him he's barred.
- Yes, I will, I'm dealing with it,
thank you.

585
00:35:52,840 --> 00:35:55,838
BARRED? It's a shit-hole anyway!

586
00:35:55,840 --> 00:35:58,239
You're barred, all right?
You're barred.

587
00:35:58,239 --> 00:36:01,518
Oh, yeah - rock hard, stood behind
a little police lady.

588
00:36:01,519 --> 00:36:04,559
If you could go back inside for me,
please.

589
00:36:04,559 --> 00:36:07,079
Yeah, piss off back inside,
you little sod.

590
00:36:07,079 --> 00:36:10,559
I don't want to hear any more
language, Neil - I've warned you.

591
00:36:10,559 --> 00:36:12,039
I want to know he's understood.

592
00:36:12,039 --> 00:36:13,518
It would help me enormously, sir,

593
00:36:13,519 --> 00:36:15,918
- if you would go back inside
the premises.
- You...

594
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:18,759
You're not welcome in these
premises at any point in the future.

595
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:21,239
Oh, go and fuck yourself
up the arse.

596
00:36:21,239 --> 00:36:22,920
You fuck yourself up the arse!

597
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:31,278
Hands behind your back, Neil.
I'm arresting you, do you
understand?

598
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:32,358
You're hurting me!

599
00:36:32,360 --> 00:36:35,639
- You're being arrested...
- You're HURTING me!
- ..for Section 5 Public Order.

600
00:36:35,639 --> 00:36:38,679
- You do not have to say anything...
- You hate me!
- That's not true, Neil.

601
00:36:38,679 --> 00:36:40,719
- Any excuse!
- You do not have to say
anything...

602
00:36:40,719 --> 00:36:43,438
First time you saw me,
you talked to me like shit.

603
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:45,838
Well that's fine and dandy,
cos I'm not right fond o' you.

604
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:49,759
- You've had too much to drink,
and you need to be listening not talking.
- You're loving this!

605
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:52,958
...but it may harm your defence -
believe me, I'm not -
if you do not mention

606
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:54,878
- when questioned...
- AAAAAAARGHHH!

607
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:57,398
...something you later rely on in court.
- AAAARGHH!

608
00:36:57,400 --> 00:37:00,358
Anything you do say may be given
in evidence. Do you understand?

609
00:37:00,360 --> 00:37:02,599
- Do you understand that, Neil?
- Piss off!

610
00:37:02,599 --> 00:37:04,199
Right, come on, get up.

611
00:37:04,199 --> 00:37:05,318
Dozy sod.

612
00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:09,838
I've asked you to go back inside
three times, now go inside.

613
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:12,918
Come on, Neil. Get up.

614
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:14,880
Come on.

615
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:18,918
That pavement's gonna get very
chilly if you stay there

616
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:22,960
much longer, and you do know it's
where the doggies do their wee-wees.

617
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:26,838
How drunk?

618
00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:27,998
'I would say...'

619
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,119
three days' worth.

620
00:37:30,119 --> 00:37:31,519
He was pretty whiffy.

621
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:34,679
'Oh, good grief...'

622
00:37:34,679 --> 00:37:36,958
I'm sorry to be the one
to tell you, love.

623
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:38,958
He were upset about something.

624
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:41,159
Last few times I saw him, and...

625
00:37:42,239 --> 00:37:43,800
Damn.

626
00:37:45,079 --> 00:37:47,759
He'll just get a fixed penalty
notice.

627
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:50,639
There's no reason why he'll lose
his job if he can pull himself

628
00:37:50,639 --> 00:37:52,559
back together and stay that way.

629
00:37:52,559 --> 00:37:54,878
'Custody Sergeant's going to
phone me when he's sober

630
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:56,199
'and we can pick him up.

631
00:37:56,199 --> 00:37:59,039
'It'll be a good few hours though,
it'll be later this evening.

632
00:37:59,039 --> 00:38:00,838
'What was he upset about?'

633
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:02,559
Oh...

634
00:38:02,559 --> 00:38:05,398
Just summat to do with
when his marriage broke down.

635
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:06,838
'OK.'

636
00:38:06,840 --> 00:38:09,039
Well, I'll see you in a bit.

637
00:38:09,039 --> 00:38:13,559
Yeah, OK, I'll, um...
Yeah, I'll see you in a bit.

638
00:38:13,559 --> 00:38:15,280
'Ta-ta.'

639
00:38:51,519 --> 00:38:53,519
When you're ready!

640
00:38:55,039 --> 00:38:56,719
Thanks. Um...

641
00:38:56,719 --> 00:38:59,639
Most of you will know
Superintendent Gillespie.

642
00:38:59,639 --> 00:39:01,559
He's heading up the review team.

643
00:39:01,559 --> 00:39:04,478
Before we go through
everything with Mr Gillespie,

644
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:07,438
there's a few bits and pieces
from this afternoon.

645
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:09,958
We've got an ident on the victim.

646
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:12,958
She's Elise May Hughes.

647
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:14,639
20 years of age.

648
00:39:14,639 --> 00:39:18,759
Address - 27 Conway Crescent,
Dewsbury.

649
00:39:18,760 --> 00:39:20,438
Last seen three days ago.

650
00:39:20,440 --> 00:39:22,760
After we arrested Sean Balmforth.

651
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:26,000
Yep, so... Shush!

652
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:30,398
The pathologist is telling me
she's confident it's the same

653
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:33,398
killer as... Well, certainly
the first three victims.

654
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:36,599
And Vicky Fleming, if we accept
that he was disturbed before

655
00:39:36,599 --> 00:39:38,998
he'd finished doing what he wanted
to do to her.

656
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:42,639
Although I think now more than ever,
we'd be wise to keep an open mind.

657
00:39:42,639 --> 00:39:45,478
The good news - for once! -

658
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:47,878
is we might have a bit of a lead.

659
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:50,918
The night Elise May Hughes' body
was left at the site in Rastrick,

660
00:39:50,920 --> 00:39:54,318
200 yards away, just further along
the road that same night,

661
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:58,119
a parked vehicle was hit by
another vehicle. Hit and run.

662
00:39:58,119 --> 00:40:01,398
I've got forensics onto it, it won't
be long before we can identify the

663
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:04,759
make and the model based on
fragments left on the vehicle
that was hit.

664
00:40:04,760 --> 00:40:07,719
I want to know who was
driving that vehicle.

665
00:40:07,719 --> 00:40:10,519
At the very least,
they may have seen something.

666
00:40:24,559 --> 00:40:25,880
Daryl?

667
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:31,480
I made you some tea.

668
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:35,840
Thanks.

669
00:40:52,639 --> 00:40:54,518
They let that fella go.

670
00:40:54,519 --> 00:40:56,878
The one they arrested.

671
00:40:56,880 --> 00:40:58,920
It's been on t'news.

672
00:41:00,320 --> 00:41:03,400
Except I think he's in custody
for something else, now.

673
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:11,719
They're looking for the driver
of a red vehicle.

674
00:41:11,719 --> 00:41:15,918
They know it was red, cos it hit
another one... Left marks.

675
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:17,440
Near where it happened.

676
00:41:18,760 --> 00:41:21,398
They think he might have
witnessed something.

677
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:22,719
The driver.

678
00:41:26,199 --> 00:41:29,398
They say it's only a matter of time
before they work out

679
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:32,079
the make and model,
if he doesn't come forward.

680
00:41:33,960 --> 00:41:35,958
I think cos of the marks.

681
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:37,000
So?

682
00:41:38,440 --> 00:41:40,639
So you better get your tale
straight.

683
00:41:40,639 --> 00:41:43,039
About how you damaged your car.

684
00:41:43,039 --> 00:41:44,639
If they come asking.

685
00:41:44,639 --> 00:41:45,958
Why would they?

686
00:41:45,960 --> 00:41:49,398
Well, them two coppers were up here
before, weren't they?

687
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:54,039
It's not me asking, it's not
something I'M interested in.

688
00:41:54,039 --> 00:41:56,039
I'm just thinking ahead.

689
00:41:56,039 --> 00:41:58,278
You don't want them to think
YOU did it, do you?

690
00:41:58,280 --> 00:41:59,838
Why would they think it's me?

691
00:41:59,840 --> 00:42:02,519
Well, apart from the car,
no reason at all, love.

692
00:42:03,519 --> 00:42:07,599
Except they arrested the wrong fella
once, they could do it again.

693
00:42:07,599 --> 00:42:09,918
And as I say,

694
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:13,880
they think this person might have
witnessed something, so...

695
00:42:18,719 --> 00:42:20,239
Where did it happen?

696
00:42:20,239 --> 00:42:21,358
What?

697
00:42:21,360 --> 00:42:23,318
Your bump. This was up Rastrick.

698
00:42:23,320 --> 00:42:25,400
I don't even know where Rastrick is.

699
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:38,000
Tell me about me mum.

700
00:42:41,039 --> 00:42:42,719
What about her?

701
00:42:42,719 --> 00:42:44,360
When she went out with me dad.

702
00:42:46,599 --> 00:42:50,079
I don't think they ever went out,
as such.

703
00:42:50,079 --> 00:42:53,358
I think she just used to hang out.
In the town.

704
00:42:53,360 --> 00:42:54,599
With this group of...

705
00:42:55,760 --> 00:42:57,398
...people, and...

706
00:42:57,400 --> 00:42:58,679
But they had me.

707
00:42:58,679 --> 00:43:01,039
Well, your MUM had you.

708
00:43:01,039 --> 00:43:02,239
He was long gone.

709
00:43:03,360 --> 00:43:04,519
To prison?

710
00:43:06,280 --> 00:43:07,760
Did she love him?

711
00:43:08,920 --> 00:43:12,518
She was... infatuated with him.

712
00:43:12,519 --> 00:43:13,958
What's that mean?

713
00:43:13,960 --> 00:43:17,039
She thought she was in love
with him,

714
00:43:17,039 --> 00:43:19,519
but she didn't know what
he was really like.

715
00:43:21,119 --> 00:43:22,998
And he took advantage of her.

716
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:25,119
What does that mean?

717
00:43:25,119 --> 00:43:26,400
Had her on.

718
00:43:31,800 --> 00:43:33,000
How?

719
00:43:34,079 --> 00:43:35,679
I don't think she...

720
00:43:38,360 --> 00:43:40,199
She was just a bit young.

721
00:43:40,199 --> 00:43:41,838
To get pregnant.

722
00:43:41,840 --> 00:43:44,119
She was 18.

723
00:43:44,119 --> 00:43:46,199
17. When she got pregnant.

724
00:43:48,199 --> 00:43:53,199
And it doesn't matter how old you
are - if you're not ready for it,
you're not ready for it.

725
00:43:56,360 --> 00:43:59,000
- Shall we have a cup of tea?
- Yes, please.

726
00:44:00,599 --> 00:44:02,199
Is that why she died?

727
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:04,760
Cos she wasn't ready?

728
00:44:07,679 --> 00:44:09,039
What's Granny said?

729
00:44:09,039 --> 00:44:11,639
She said that she died
when I was born,

730
00:44:11,639 --> 00:44:13,478
but it wasn't my fault.

731
00:44:13,480 --> 00:44:15,519
No. No.

732
00:44:16,880 --> 00:44:18,320
Well...

733
00:44:19,360 --> 00:44:21,039
Sometimes it just happens.

734
00:44:21,039 --> 00:44:22,119
Yeah.

735
00:44:47,159 --> 00:44:48,599
How're you feeling?

736
00:44:51,480 --> 00:44:54,358
Clare's outside.
Public aren't allowed in here.

737
00:44:54,360 --> 00:44:55,760
Well, not unless they've...

738
00:44:59,800 --> 00:45:01,679
You can speak to me, you know, Neil.

739
00:45:01,679 --> 00:45:04,719
I know what alcohol does to people,
I see it every day.

740
00:45:05,920 --> 00:45:07,918
I know you're not like that.

741
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:10,880
I mean, I know you don't want
to be like that.

742
00:45:12,280 --> 00:45:13,760
I'm sorry.

743
00:45:17,280 --> 00:45:18,719
Come on.

744
00:45:24,760 --> 00:45:27,679
Have you fallen off the wagon
before, since you've been dry?

745
00:45:27,679 --> 00:45:29,400
Twice.

746
00:45:32,119 --> 00:45:33,559
OK, well...

747
00:45:34,719 --> 00:45:37,280
...you tell me what I can do
to support you.

748
00:45:38,920 --> 00:45:42,199
You know yourself best, you know
your habits. What do you need?
What can I do?

749
00:45:42,199 --> 00:45:44,639
Catherine, I just want to go home,

750
00:45:44,639 --> 00:45:47,079
want to get a shower,
get rid of this headache,

751
00:45:47,079 --> 00:45:49,000
get back to normal,
put it behind me.

752
00:45:51,320 --> 00:45:53,438
Did you ring in sick at work?

753
00:45:53,440 --> 00:45:54,998
You didn't just go AWOL?

754
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:56,239
I took three days off.

755
00:45:57,239 --> 00:46:00,880
You see, when I know the way
things are going - up here...

756
00:46:04,519 --> 00:46:06,360
...I plan ahead.

757
00:46:13,880 --> 00:46:15,039
(Right.)

758
00:46:21,760 --> 00:46:24,278
Well, just... I don't know what
triggers you, and I'm sorry

759
00:46:24,280 --> 00:46:26,478
if you've got something upsetting
you at the minute

760
00:46:26,480 --> 00:46:27,518
that's sparked it off.

761
00:46:27,519 --> 00:46:29,958
But Clare's vulnerable too,
and she's my priority,

762
00:46:29,960 --> 00:46:32,838
and I won't watch her get
dragged down. Not by anyone.

763
00:46:32,840 --> 00:46:35,199
I'm sorry if you think
I've not been very friendly.

764
00:46:35,199 --> 00:46:38,239
I am sorry. She's very fond of you
and I want to respect that,
all right?

765
00:46:38,239 --> 00:46:39,880
But please don't mess her about.

766
00:46:41,840 --> 00:46:43,199
I won't.

767
00:47:18,079 --> 00:47:19,998
Three days?

768
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:21,798
What, and then he can just stop?

769
00:47:21,800 --> 00:47:23,239
I don't know.

770
00:47:23,239 --> 00:47:26,798
D'you think it's good for her?
Being with someone who's the same?

771
00:47:26,800 --> 00:47:28,998
What can I do? She's grown up.

772
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:32,918
You think they'll be all right
together on their own in his flat?

773
00:47:32,920 --> 00:47:35,759
I mean, it isn't five minutes since
she... fell off the wagon, is it?

774
00:47:35,760 --> 00:47:36,878
No, they're coming here.

775
00:47:36,880 --> 00:47:39,639
He's gone to tidy himself up,
then they're going to an AA meeting

776
00:47:39,639 --> 00:47:41,599
in Halifax, then they're coming
here.

777
00:47:41,599 --> 00:47:46,318
That WOULD worry me. If ever they
did decide to move in together.

778
00:47:46,320 --> 00:47:49,639
It wouldn't have till today, but,
my God, you should have seen him.

779
00:47:49,639 --> 00:47:51,719
Is this mental?

780
00:47:51,719 --> 00:47:53,599
What?

781
00:47:53,599 --> 00:47:55,478
Three days, he's been pissed.

782
00:47:55,480 --> 00:47:57,798
Disappeared, God knows where.

783
00:47:57,800 --> 00:48:01,159
And then another one of these women
has been murdered.

784
00:48:02,679 --> 00:48:04,679
Why would you think that about him?

785
00:48:06,760 --> 00:48:10,079
- He's really uncomfortable
around you.
- Yeah, I know,

786
00:48:10,079 --> 00:48:11,679
but that could just...

787
00:48:12,920 --> 00:48:15,159
...be my effortless
overwhelming charisma.

788
00:48:16,639 --> 00:48:18,440
Yeah, and that, obviously.

789
00:48:19,519 --> 00:48:21,079
It IS mental.

790
00:48:21,079 --> 00:48:22,438
I know it's mental.

791
00:48:22,440 --> 00:48:25,239
When the Ripper was around,
everybody was thinking it was

792
00:48:25,239 --> 00:48:28,759
their husband and their son
and their dad and their uncle.

793
00:48:28,760 --> 00:48:31,239
Yeah, but... It's someone.

794
00:48:33,960 --> 00:48:36,239
And the other thing.

795
00:48:36,239 --> 00:48:38,719
Ryan was asking about Becky.

796
00:48:38,719 --> 00:48:40,360
After you went out.

797
00:48:41,440 --> 00:48:43,320
About her relationship with...

798
00:48:44,440 --> 00:48:45,719
...him.

799
00:48:46,760 --> 00:48:49,918
I didn't say owt. I just said
she was infatuated

800
00:48:49,920 --> 00:48:53,119
and she didn't really know what
he was like, but it struck me -

801
00:48:53,119 --> 00:48:55,559
it's when he gets home from school.

802
00:48:55,559 --> 00:48:58,559
That's when he's got a new thing,
a new question,

803
00:48:58,559 --> 00:49:01,079
like someone's put ideas
in his head.

804
00:49:01,079 --> 00:49:02,759
At school?

805
00:49:02,760 --> 00:49:04,119
Yeah.

806
00:49:23,599 --> 00:49:25,079
Mum?

807
00:49:27,559 --> 00:49:28,960
Mum?

808
00:49:30,480 --> 00:49:32,159
Mum.

809
00:49:38,519 --> 00:49:41,358
Mum, I need to talk to you, Mum.

810
00:49:41,360 --> 00:49:43,440
What's the matter?

811
00:49:45,960 --> 00:49:47,119
I don't feel so well.

812
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:50,398
What is it?

813
00:49:50,400 --> 00:49:51,960
Headache?

814
00:49:53,440 --> 00:49:56,199
I don't want to go and tell
the police about me car.

815
00:50:02,800 --> 00:50:05,079
OK.

816
00:50:05,079 --> 00:50:06,400
Is that OK?

817
00:50:09,400 --> 00:50:10,599
Why?

818
00:50:13,280 --> 00:50:14,719
Why don't you want to?

819
00:50:19,800 --> 00:50:21,280
Because...

820
00:50:22,519 --> 00:50:24,320
...I've done things.

821
00:50:25,719 --> 00:50:27,039
What things?

822
00:50:28,519 --> 00:50:30,199
Things.

823
00:50:30,199 --> 00:50:31,599
What things?

824
00:50:33,760 --> 00:50:35,440
I think you'll be cross.

825
00:50:37,320 --> 00:50:39,840
No, don't turn the light on.
Do you mind?

826
00:50:46,519 --> 00:50:48,719
What is it you've done, love?

827
00:50:51,039 --> 00:50:53,998
You know you can tell me anything.

828
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:56,480
I've always said that. Haven't I?

829
00:50:58,039 --> 00:51:01,159
If you tell me the truth,
I won't be cross. About anything.

830
00:51:02,960 --> 00:51:04,518
Yeah.

831
00:51:04,519 --> 00:51:06,280
Well, then...

832
00:51:10,199 --> 00:51:12,239
I...

833
00:51:14,920 --> 00:51:16,239
Have you hurt someone?

834
00:51:17,480 --> 00:51:19,119
Yeah.

835
00:51:19,119 --> 00:51:21,639
With your car?

836
00:51:21,639 --> 00:51:22,960
No.

837
00:51:24,199 --> 00:51:25,519
Is it...?

838
00:51:30,400 --> 00:51:32,559
Is it to do with those women?

839
00:51:32,559 --> 00:51:34,239
Why you saying that?

840
00:51:34,239 --> 00:51:36,878
- Is it?
- Why you saying that?!

841
00:51:36,880 --> 00:51:38,639
Because...

842
00:51:38,639 --> 00:51:40,398
- I wondered.
- Had you? When?

843
00:51:40,400 --> 00:51:41,918
A while back.

844
00:51:41,920 --> 00:51:43,360
Why didn't you tell me?

845
00:51:50,719 --> 00:51:52,679
If it was...

846
00:51:52,679 --> 00:51:54,239
would you tell the police?

847
00:51:55,239 --> 00:51:57,159
Well, would you want me to?

848
00:51:58,320 --> 00:51:59,719
No.

849
00:52:01,679 --> 00:52:04,079
I just...
I don't know what I'd do

850
00:52:04,079 --> 00:52:06,518
if they came looking for me.

851
00:52:06,519 --> 00:52:09,039
The thing is,
they've got my DNA now,

852
00:52:09,039 --> 00:52:10,918
cos of that fight the other day.

853
00:52:10,920 --> 00:52:13,239
And I'd not get far if I set off.

854
00:52:13,239 --> 00:52:14,760
Why?!

855
00:52:17,480 --> 00:52:19,239
Why did you?

856
00:52:29,199 --> 00:52:31,918
Why, though?

857
00:52:31,920 --> 00:52:33,519
I don't know.

858
00:52:40,280 --> 00:52:42,679
We've had a funny life,
haven't we, lad?

859
00:53:04,960 --> 00:53:06,400
What you thinking?

860
00:53:09,880 --> 00:53:11,480
I don't know.

861
00:53:13,880 --> 00:53:16,559
I'm wondering
if there's a way forward.

862
00:53:18,159 --> 00:53:19,880
If we could get rid of the car.

863
00:53:21,119 --> 00:53:24,199
But then, there's 1,001
other things to think about.

864
00:53:29,960 --> 00:53:31,800
Are you sure it was you?

865
00:53:37,920 --> 00:53:39,719
Did someone tell you to do it?

866
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:42,318
No.

867
00:53:42,320 --> 00:53:43,360
Voices?

868
00:53:45,239 --> 00:53:46,759
No.

869
00:53:46,760 --> 00:53:49,838
Sometimes people hear voices
telling 'em to do stuff.

870
00:53:49,840 --> 00:53:51,199
No.

871
00:53:58,199 --> 00:53:59,679
OK.

872
00:54:10,239 --> 00:54:13,039
You'll visit me, won't you,
in prison?

873
00:54:14,440 --> 00:54:16,519
I don't think you'd like prison.

874
00:54:18,880 --> 00:54:22,519
No, but if you can't think of
anything, then it's what'll happen.

875
00:54:52,400 --> 00:54:53,958
How's Neil?

876
00:54:53,960 --> 00:54:55,478
He's gone to work.

877
00:54:55,480 --> 00:54:58,880
- Oh, good.
- Half six this morning.

878
00:55:00,119 --> 00:55:02,358
That's good.

879
00:55:02,360 --> 00:55:04,679
Hey, have you run that theory
past Clare, Mum?

880
00:55:04,679 --> 00:55:06,599
- What theory?
- Which?

881
00:55:06,599 --> 00:55:08,398
That woman on your phone.

882
00:55:08,400 --> 00:55:11,278
Oh, yeah! You know a couple of
weeks ago,

883
00:55:11,280 --> 00:55:14,159
that new Miss Wealand, Whelan -
whatever her name is.

884
00:55:14,159 --> 00:55:16,639
Asking Ryan questions
about his dad.

885
00:55:16,639 --> 00:55:18,239
Yeah.

886
00:55:18,239 --> 00:55:21,719
Daniel reckons it's always
when he comes home from school

887
00:55:21,719 --> 00:55:24,119
that he starts asking
questions about him.

888
00:55:24,119 --> 00:55:27,239
- Is it?
- Yeah.
- Have you met her?

889
00:55:27,239 --> 00:55:28,840
Yeah, I told you I had.

890
00:55:33,239 --> 00:55:35,039
Where's your glasses?

891
00:55:36,440 --> 00:55:37,679
Isn't that a lad?

892
00:55:38,719 --> 00:55:41,280
No, it's a woman.
The man in the shop said.

893
00:55:48,559 --> 00:55:50,878
What you thinking?

894
00:55:50,880 --> 00:55:52,159
I'm thinking...

895
00:55:53,159 --> 00:55:54,559
What?

896
00:55:57,159 --> 00:55:58,719
It's her.

897
00:56:25,599 --> 00:56:27,159
This is nice.

898
00:56:28,280 --> 00:56:29,998
I've got a plan.

899
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:31,878
Have you?

900
00:56:31,880 --> 00:56:35,559
You've always wanted to go
to America, haven't you?

901
00:56:35,559 --> 00:56:37,438
How we going to afford that?

902
00:56:37,440 --> 00:56:40,518
I've got some money put by.
Quite a bit.

903
00:56:40,519 --> 00:56:41,798
How much?

904
00:56:41,800 --> 00:56:43,759
Couple of thousand.

905
00:56:43,760 --> 00:56:45,599
We've got our passports.

906
00:56:45,599 --> 00:56:47,438
We'll call a taxi.

907
00:56:47,440 --> 00:56:49,358
Get on a train to Manchester.

908
00:56:49,360 --> 00:56:51,159
Then we'll get on an aeroplane.

909
00:56:51,159 --> 00:56:55,159
And they might catch up with us
eventually - I think they very
probably would -

910
00:56:55,159 --> 00:56:58,159
but at least you'll have done
something.

911
00:56:58,159 --> 00:57:01,759
At least we'd have seen something
of the world, had an adventure,
wouldn't we?

912
00:57:01,760 --> 00:57:03,318
Las Vegas?

913
00:57:03,320 --> 00:57:05,278
Is that what you'd like?

914
00:57:05,280 --> 00:57:09,000
Nevada. The desert.
Duke and Gonzo, we could hire a car.

915
00:57:13,639 --> 00:57:14,840
OK.

916
00:57:20,119 --> 00:57:21,760
Seriously?

917
00:57:31,760 --> 00:57:33,840
What else would you like to do?

918
00:57:34,880 --> 00:57:36,679
To see?

919
00:57:36,679 --> 00:57:39,278
- Florida.
- Yeah.

920
00:57:39,280 --> 00:57:41,599
- California.
- San Francisco.

921
00:57:43,159 --> 00:57:45,438
Who'll feed the sheep?

922
00:57:45,440 --> 00:57:46,960
I'll ask me sister.

923
00:57:48,840 --> 00:57:51,880
We could cycle across
the Golden Gate Bridge.

924
00:57:52,880 --> 00:57:55,159
You can hire bicycles.

925
00:57:55,159 --> 00:57:57,318
I saw it on a travel programme.

926
00:57:57,320 --> 00:57:59,278
Will she do that?

927
00:57:59,280 --> 00:58:02,119
Yeah. I'll pay her.

928
00:58:02,119 --> 00:58:04,199
Then you can get the ferry back.

929
00:58:04,199 --> 00:58:06,039
Go past Alcatraz.

930
00:58:06,039 --> 00:58:07,719
Won't go there, though.

931
00:58:07,719 --> 00:58:09,199
Can we go to Disneyland?

932
00:58:09,199 --> 00:58:11,239
Course we can, love.
