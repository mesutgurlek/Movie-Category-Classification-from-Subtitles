7
00:03:59,197 --> 00:04:02,282
Now, Senator Friedman, you have been a harsh critic...

8
00:04:02,367 --> 00:04:05,160
of the President in recent months
over his treatment of Russia.

9
00:04:05,245 --> 00:04:08,997
Russia is back. Their president
has stated unequivocally...

10
00:04:09,082 --> 00:04:11,458
their desire to knock us back to 1985.

11
00:04:11,542 --> 00:04:13,794
They've reignited their nuclear program.

12
00:04:13,878 --> 00:04:17,130
Just Iast week they dropped three Akula
class subs in the Bering Sea.

13
00:04:17,215 --> 00:04:19,800
Our myopia over the Middle East...

14
00:04:19,884 --> 00:04:23,845
has caused us to miss the big bear that's
just sitting in the middle of the room.

15
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:28,308
Now, Senator Darden, you have numerous
business interests inside Russia.

16
00:04:28,393 --> 00:04:30,811
Do you share Senator Friedman's fears here?

17
00:04:30,895 --> 00:04:33,814
My interests, as you call them, in Russia...

18
00:04:33,898 --> 00:04:36,817
are strictly as a trade partner for
the good people of my state.

19
00:04:36,901 --> 00:04:39,987
All this saber rattling is basically
Senator Friedman's attempt...

20
00:04:40,071 --> 00:04:42,489
to get his budget up for next year.

21
00:04:42,573 --> 00:04:45,325
Oh, Please. Russia now has ten times
the number of covert agents...

22
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:47,995
within United States borders as
it did during the Cold War.

23
00:04:48,079 --> 00:04:51,665
What are we talking about? Besides,
wouldn't it be wise for you...

24
00:04:51,749 --> 00:04:55,043
to divest your interest of what you
have in Russia at a time like this?

25
00:04:55,128 --> 00:04:58,338
I am very transparent about all
of my financial transactions...

26
00:04:58,423 --> 00:05:02,009
which is why, you know, that I
did those things. Excuse me.

27
00:05:02,093 --> 00:05:05,887
The President would suggest that fear
is not helpful right now, Senator...

28
00:05:05,972 --> 00:05:09,725
that fear is obviously a very big component
of any politician's toolbox...

29
00:05:09,809 --> 00:05:13,061
but that it is not going to help toward progress.

30
00:05:13,146 --> 00:05:15,397
Leaving.

31
00:05:15,481 --> 00:05:16,732
Thank God.

(man) You haven't accessed the money.

35
00:05:26,659 --> 00:05:28,869
Yeah, well, it's been a little warm around here.

36
00:05:28,953 --> 00:05:31,079
We had a deal, Senator. We have expectations.

37
00:05:31,164 --> 00:05:34,374
I don't give a good goddamn about your expectations.

38
00:05:34,459 --> 00:05:35,917
Don't call here again.

You have no jurisdiction, authority, or right to be here.

49
00:06:20,213 --> 00:06:22,255
We've been trailing this guy for the past month.

50
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:24,758
This is a crime scene, not a goddamn terrorist attack!

51
00:06:24,842 --> 00:06:26,301
You're going to have to wait.

52
00:06:26,386 --> 00:06:28,929
Yeah? What am I supposed to wait for?

Director Highland. Sir, why is the CIA--

58
00:06:55,415 --> 00:06:58,250
This is Agent Weaver. Yes, sir.

59
00:06:59,752 --> 00:07:00,836
Yes, sir.

60
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:03,630
We're out!

00:07:05,883 --> 00:07:09,052

No questions and not a word.

63
00:07:10,721 --> 00:07:12,973
You guys were on the stakeout?

64
00:07:13,057 --> 00:07:16,476
Yes, sir. He's had contact with Moscow
off and on for a month now.

65
00:07:16,561 --> 00:07:18,186
But he never went any further--

66
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:20,313
We know that. What happened here tonight?

67
00:07:20,398 --> 00:07:22,983
Someone grabbed him from behind.
Right in our blind spot.

68
00:07:23,067 --> 00:07:25,277
It all happened so goddamned fast.

Excuse me? Do you know the time?

No, no. I don't have a watch. Sorry.

73
00:08:03,441 --> 00:08:06,359
It's okay. Just, my husband said he'd be here by nine.

74
00:08:06,444 --> 00:08:07,819
Oh.

00:08:09,822 --> 00:08:11,406

Oh, yeah. He's good.

Jeez!

90
00:09:09,006 --> 00:09:13,093
I never thought I'd see the day when someone
got the drop on Paul Shepherdson.

91
00:09:13,177 --> 00:09:15,428
Yeah, yeah. How did you get in here?

92
00:09:15,513 --> 00:09:17,097
It's what we do.

93
00:09:17,181 --> 00:09:19,391
The phone rings, too, you know.

94
00:09:24,188 --> 00:09:25,981
It's Cassius.

95
00:09:28,025 --> 00:09:30,026
He's back.

96
00:09:32,572 --> 00:09:34,656
Tom.

97
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:36,575
Cassius is Iong gone.

98
00:09:38,411 --> 00:09:40,620
He hasn't even been heard from in over 20 years.

99
00:09:40,705 --> 00:09:43,123
Tell that to Senator Darden.

100
00:09:43,207 --> 00:09:45,625
He's Iying in an alley with his throat slit.

101
00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:47,836
Then it's a copycat.

102
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:50,922
That's what everyone is saying. Well, almost everyone.

103
00:09:54,385 --> 00:09:59,014
Tom, there was a point where I knew
this man better than myself.

104
00:09:59,098 --> 00:10:02,309
Cassius is dead.

105
00:10:02,393 --> 00:10:04,686
For once, Paul, I think you're wrong.

Gentlemen.

109
00:10:38,471 --> 00:10:40,388
Paul, this is Director Roger Bell.

110
00:10:40,473 --> 00:10:41,848
Mr. Shepherdson.

111
00:10:41,932 --> 00:10:43,516
The FBI?

112
00:10:43,601 --> 00:10:45,518
Bureaucracy has changed, my friend.

113
00:10:45,603 --> 00:10:47,687
We have to share the burden now.

114
00:10:47,772 --> 00:10:49,522
As you know, Paul was responsible...

115
00:10:49,607 --> 00:10:51,524
for tracking down the Cassius Seven...

116
00:10:51,609 --> 00:10:53,568
The Soviet assassins we code-named...

117
00:10:53,653 --> 00:10:56,237
for the Roman senators who killed Julius Caesar.

118
00:10:56,322 --> 00:10:59,032
And you caught them all but one,
from what I understand.

119
00:10:59,116 --> 00:11:01,242
Missed Cassius himself?

120
00:11:01,327 --> 00:11:03,536
That's right.

121
00:11:03,621 --> 00:11:06,206
But this is not his work. I'm sure of it.

122
00:11:06,290 --> 00:11:08,541
Oh, I think it is.

123
00:11:08,626 --> 00:11:10,418
Who the hell is this?

124
00:11:10,503 --> 00:11:13,213
This is one of my men. Agent Ben Geary.

125
00:11:13,297 --> 00:11:16,257
Probably knows more about your
assassin than anyone we've got.

126
00:11:16,342 --> 00:11:18,927
Or the CIA, for that matter.

127
00:11:19,011 --> 00:11:22,555
Paul, we'd like the two of you to work together.

128
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:25,433
Is that so? So tell me, Geary...

129
00:11:25,518 --> 00:11:28,269
what were you doing when the wall came down?

130
00:11:28,354 --> 00:11:30,563
I was watching it on television.

131
00:11:30,648 --> 00:11:33,233
Just Iike everyone else in this room.

132
00:11:33,317 --> 00:11:35,735
[laughter]

133
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:37,862
Could you pull up the case file, please?

134
00:11:40,658 --> 00:11:42,742
Okay, here is good. Notice how the cut starts...

135
00:11:42,827 --> 00:11:45,245
right in the center of the throat, moving upwards.

136
00:11:45,329 --> 00:11:47,914
Typically, a cut starts high, moves lateral...

137
00:11:47,998 --> 00:11:50,750
as the right-handed killer pulls
the knife from ear to ear.

138
00:11:50,835 --> 00:11:53,586
Not Cassius. His cuts were always exactly the same.

139
00:11:53,671 --> 00:11:57,257
Right-handed, but up, and starting
in the middle of the neck.

140
00:11:57,341 --> 00:11:59,259
I've never been able to figure out why.

141
00:11:59,343 --> 00:12:01,970
Still, it's a copycat.

142
00:12:02,054 --> 00:12:04,431
This guy's the best you've got?

143
00:12:04,515 --> 00:12:09,102
Mr. Shepherdson, I wrote my
Master's thesis on Cassius.

144
00:12:09,186 --> 00:12:11,312
And I have tracked down and interviewed...

145
00:12:11,397 --> 00:12:14,441
every one of the few witnesses of
his crimes who are still alive.

146
00:12:14,525 --> 00:12:17,444
I've even re-created and personally
walked the approaches and exits...

147
00:12:17,528 --> 00:12:20,113
of all his known kills step for step. I know this man.

148
00:12:20,197 --> 00:12:24,659
And there is no doubt in my mind.
This is the work of Cassius.

149
00:12:24,744 --> 00:12:26,411
You know him?

150
00:12:28,205 --> 00:12:29,789
Harvard, right?

151
00:12:29,874 --> 00:12:32,667
Yes, that's right.

152
00:12:32,752 --> 00:12:36,296
And you were the son of a foreign attaché in Turkey.

153
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:40,467
My father worked at embassies all over the world.

154
00:12:40,551 --> 00:12:41,968
How do you know this?

155
00:12:42,052 --> 00:12:43,678
I read your thesis.

156
00:12:43,763 --> 00:12:45,805
You did?

157
00:12:45,890 --> 00:12:48,141
And I know you were trying for months to talk to me.

158
00:12:48,225 --> 00:12:51,686
I'll tell you why I refused. Because you
have never been on the ground.

159
00:12:51,771 --> 00:12:56,649
Because you don't know him. And
because you're a Iibrarian.

160
00:12:56,734 --> 00:12:58,693
Mr. Shepherdson.

161
00:12:58,778 --> 00:13:01,988
Let's just say, Geary, that I'm
wrong and you expose him.

162
00:13:02,072 --> 00:13:03,990
What do you think comes next?

163
00:13:04,074 --> 00:13:07,660
You think maybe he's gonna come after you?

164
00:13:07,745 --> 00:13:11,122
That is exactly why I'm here.

165

[exhales]

166
00:13:15,419 --> 00:13:17,504
I'm going home.

167
00:13:17,588 --> 00:13:20,715
And I'd like to be left alone. All right?

168
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,967
We've got Brutus.

169
00:13:25,095 --> 00:13:26,846
What?

170
00:13:26,931 --> 00:13:30,350
Igor Ivanovich Kozak, aka Brutus...

171
00:13:30,434 --> 00:13:33,186
is alive and locked up in Brinkerman Penitentiary.

172
00:13:33,270 --> 00:13:36,064
That's impossible. He killed him in Salzburg in 1989.

173
00:13:36,148 --> 00:13:39,192
I shot him in the chest. He fell three stories.

174
00:13:39,276 --> 00:13:40,735
And survived.

175
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:42,195
Why didn't you tell me?

176
00:13:42,279 --> 00:13:43,905
You wanted to retire, Paul.

177
00:13:43,989 --> 00:13:46,908
I'm afraid retirees Iose certain privileges.

178
00:13:48,452 --> 00:13:49,661
You know what?

179
00:13:50,788 --> 00:13:52,705
I'm done here, Tom.

180
00:14:38,711 --> 00:14:40,962
Get me Highland.

181
00:14:46,010 --> 00:14:48,303
Come on, I know you're there. Get me Highland.

182
00:14:48,387 --> 00:14:51,764
(operator) Your call cannot be completed as dialed.

183
00:14:51,849 --> 00:14:54,309
Director Highland wants you
to know he has a meeting...

184
00:14:54,393 --> 00:14:56,102
with the President tomorrow morning.

185
00:14:56,186 --> 00:14:58,897
He said you'd know what that means.

186
00:15:26,884 --> 00:15:28,843
Good morning. Two regulars, please.

187
00:15:28,928 --> 00:15:30,970
Good morning, sir. Coming right up.

188
00:15:34,892 --> 00:15:38,519
Spooks aren't supposed to be creatures of habit.

189
00:15:38,604 --> 00:15:41,814
It's a Iuxury one can only afford when one is in charge.

190
00:15:41,899 --> 00:15:43,399
Thank you.

191
00:15:43,484 --> 00:15:44,943
(clerk) Thank you very much.

192
00:15:46,403 --> 00:15:47,737
Thanks.

193
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:59,165
I gave you 20 years, Tom.

194
00:15:59,249 --> 00:16:02,835
You promised me I could have a Iife.

195
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:05,505
I never cared much for the coffee at The White House.

196
00:16:05,589 --> 00:16:08,883
I think it's got something to do
with the 150-year-old china.

197
00:16:10,761 --> 00:16:14,013
I've been Director through three presidents, Paul.

198
00:16:14,098 --> 00:16:16,849
And Iet's face it. I wouldn't have gotten
the job in the first place...

199
00:16:16,934 --> 00:16:19,435
if you hadn't helped us with the Cassius Seven.

200
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:23,523
In 15 minutes, the President is gonna tell
me I don't have this job anymore...

201
00:16:23,607 --> 00:16:26,526
if we can't nail the guy that killed Senator Darden.

202
00:16:26,610 --> 00:16:28,486
It's not Cassius, Tom.

203
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:31,322
You never caught him.

204
00:16:34,785 --> 00:16:38,121
Because he's dead.

205
00:16:39,498 --> 00:16:41,374
Then prove it.

Mr. Shepherdson?

209
00:18:12,049 --> 00:18:14,801
So, Paul Shepherdson.

210

Been an analyst for the company
here in Paris for three years.

211
00:18:18,222 --> 00:18:20,014
What do you wanna see me about?

212
00:18:20,099 --> 00:18:22,266
The Cassius Seven.

213
00:18:25,062 --> 00:18:26,646
I've had a breakthrough.

214
00:18:26,730 --> 00:18:29,273
I can take them down for you.

215
00:18:44,748 --> 00:18:48,167
(agent) I'll take care of it. Just
give me about 15 minutes.

216
00:18:48,252 --> 00:18:49,877
Oh, hey.

217
00:18:49,962 --> 00:18:51,504
And? And, and, and, and?

I don't know.

219
00:18:52,923 --> 00:18:54,340
Director Bell was there?

220
00:18:54,424 --> 00:18:56,425
Everyone was there.

221
00:18:56,510 --> 00:18:59,220
Jesus! I've been at this place a year Ionger than you...

222
00:18:59,304 --> 00:19:02,014
and I've never even seen the Director in person.

223
00:19:02,099 --> 00:19:06,185
They're gonna put you in the field, man. I'm sure of it.

224
00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:08,354
They haven't said anything, yet.

225
00:19:08,438 --> 00:19:11,232
You were right about this thing the whole time, huh?

[telephone rings]

227
00:19:13,652 --> 00:19:16,195
Agent Geary. Yes, sir.

228
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:18,114
Yes, sir.

229
00:19:19,783 --> 00:19:21,325
Yes, sir. I'll be there.

230
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:24,745
And?

231
00:19:30,794 --> 00:19:33,004
I'm in.

232
00:19:54,651 --> 00:19:57,111
This is crazy.

233
00:19:57,196 --> 00:20:00,448
'Cause I have spent so much time
studying your work with Cassius.

234
00:20:00,532 --> 00:20:02,241
I feel Iike I know you.

235
00:20:02,326 --> 00:20:04,785
You don't.

236
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:08,414
Yeah. No, I just mean I-I, you know,
I put myself in your shoes.

237
00:20:08,498 --> 00:20:10,917
I just tried to think how you would think.

238
00:20:11,001 --> 00:20:14,086
I've all of these crime scene photos.
A lot of them you're in.

239
00:20:14,171 --> 00:20:17,757
Actually, I should probably get you
to sign one of them. Right?

240
00:20:17,841 --> 00:20:20,468
That would definitely be a first.

241
00:20:20,552 --> 00:20:23,971
When you were in Budapest in 91,
did you notice a specific pattern?

242
00:20:24,056 --> 00:20:26,140
No, Agent Geary.

243

Tell me why-why would a guy...

join the Bureau and not Central Intelligence?

246
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:41,447
Well, I believed that Cassius was hiding in the U.S.

247
00:20:41,531 --> 00:20:44,575
Think about it. What better place
for a Soviet spook to retire?

248
00:20:46,411 --> 00:20:49,997
You believe that enough to base a career on it?

249
00:20:50,082 --> 00:20:52,667
Uh, yeah. You could say that.

250
00:20:52,751 --> 00:20:54,460
Can I ask you something?

251
00:20:54,544 --> 00:20:59,131
If that means you'll stop talking, yeah.

252
00:20:59,216 --> 00:21:02,009
Why didn't they tell you about Brutus?

If it was your job to catch the Cassius Seven,
what were they scared you'd do?

254
00:21:08,558 --> 00:21:10,101

Here's some Russian for you.

266

I've read that you worked with Cassius.

It's a different Iife ago.

268
00:22:44,988 --> 00:22:46,572
Do you know where he's hiding?

269
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:49,909
Why would you--

270
00:22:52,162 --> 00:22:53,913
Is Cassius alive?

271
00:22:53,997 --> 00:22:55,373
He killed a Senator.

272
00:22:59,503 --> 00:23:01,712
Who are you?

about Cassius and it is yours.

Give it to me, you son of a whore!

280
00:23:31,034 --> 00:23:33,285
Tell me something about Cassius. Did he train you?

281
00:23:33,370 --> 00:23:34,954

Okay.

He made his name as a soldier.

289

But rather than take the easy
route through the academia...

290
00:24:15,912 --> 00:24:18,497
he honed other skills.

291
00:24:18,582 --> 00:24:20,207
And he trained you?

292
00:24:20,292 --> 00:24:23,377
He trained us all ...his way.

293
00:24:23,462 --> 00:24:26,338
He only wanted the best.

294
00:24:26,423 --> 00:24:28,132
For that he wanted proof.

295
00:24:36,766 --> 00:24:39,518
Only six of us survived.

296
00:24:39,603 --> 00:24:44,190
And together we became your Cassius Seven.

297
00:24:44,274 --> 00:24:46,066
And you never saw him again?

298
00:24:46,151 --> 00:24:48,068
No.

299
00:24:48,153 --> 00:24:52,198
We got our targets from him
through the usual channels.

300
00:24:52,282 --> 00:24:55,034
But he planned the kills.

301
00:24:55,118 --> 00:24:58,746
His intel was always the best.

302
00:24:58,830 --> 00:25:02,541
His instinct for when to strike, always sharpest.

303

What happened to him?

304
00:25:04,461 --> 00:25:06,712
He made mistake.

305
00:25:06,796 --> 00:25:09,757
He lived outside parameters.

306
00:25:09,841 --> 00:25:11,550
What kind of parameters?

307
00:25:11,635 --> 00:25:14,887
Parameters of an assassin.

308
00:25:14,971 --> 00:25:16,555
What did you do to him?

309
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:18,057
Give him the radio.

310
00:25:18,141 --> 00:25:19,725
No, no. I wanna hear specifically--

311

I said give him the radio!

312

Just do it! Give it to him.

Why didn't you Iet me finish my Iine of questioning?

321
00:25:51,174 --> 00:25:52,758
Because he was Iying.

I tried to kill him once for a reason.

323
00:25:55,011 --> 00:25:57,096
Yeah, but the wire makes perfect sense.

324
00:25:57,180 --> 00:25:59,473
It explains why the cuts always
start from the middle...

325
00:25:59,558 --> 00:26:01,934
and then work their way up. This opens up everything.

00:26:04,062 --> 00:26:06,605
and compare the cuts with other
wire killings in Europe.

Cramping and vomiting blood.

339
00:27:24,434 --> 00:27:25,809
Okay, get him into three.

Can I get a bowl? Bowl, please!

344
00:27:38,114 --> 00:27:39,198
Got it.

You were there. It was you.

I never killed anyone in Geneva.

I'm the one who shot you in Salzburg.

Geneva until after the fact.

They brought in someone with-with no ties to you.

Yeah, the others said that, too.

Did they tell you it was someone
from the Black Caucasus?

A soldier, I think.

367
00:29:38,568 --> 00:29:41,028
We could find him together.

You need to drop this investigation.

How exactly am I supposed to drop it?

If he comes after me, I'm prepared. Not you.

You've got a wife. You have two kids.

Yeah. I think they understand
what I'm doing is important.

Have you thought about what you're
gonna do if you find him?

That is all I think about.

And now that it's real, I want it more.

I want to know him. I want to understand him.

And then?

And then I wanna put him away, for good.

Research.

Volks-Volkskrant-Volks.

398
00:34:00,496 --> 00:34:03,248
De Volkskrant. It's a daily newspaper in Holland.

00:34:03,332 --> 00:34:06,084
The third page there's a story about a wire killing.

Ten days before the Soviets held
their first open election.

Yeah. I think so.

You've gotta put in a word to get me on this case.

00:35:33,089 --> 00:35:36,883
Apparently Brutus swallowed the batteries
from the radio that we gave him.

419
00:35:36,968 --> 00:35:40,011
I'm guessing he put out some calls.
Found a place to Iay Iow.

Word got back to Cassius.

421
00:35:42,473 --> 00:35:45,225
He's never one to allow Ioose ends.

422
00:35:45,309 --> 00:35:48,019
Loose ends, meaning he spoke to us.

423
00:35:48,104 --> 00:35:50,897
Probably. Yeah.

424
00:35:50,982 --> 00:35:53,400
Well, we should get all the phone records...

425
00:35:53,484 --> 00:35:56,528
of every cell phone hospital extension here.

426
00:35:56,612 --> 00:35:57,904
AII right. Okay.

427
00:36:02,326 --> 00:36:04,744
You know, I always had this theory...

428
00:36:06,789 --> 00:36:09,833
that Cassius would return to the scene of his crimes.

429
00:36:11,627 --> 00:36:13,920
Watch his investigators.

430
00:36:15,298 --> 00:36:17,549
You think he's that vain?

431
00:36:17,633 --> 00:36:21,094
Well, I think that some of it's vanity.

432
00:36:21,179 --> 00:36:24,014
Some of it is he wants to see what he's up against.

433
00:36:32,982 --> 00:36:35,066
You see that guy in the back? Brown jacket.

Yeah, me neither. Let the Bureau know.

446
00:39:22,026 --> 00:39:24,110
He's wearing a brown suede jacket.

447
00:39:24,195 --> 00:39:26,237
Sandy blond hair, close cropped.

448
00:39:26,322 --> 00:39:29,074
No. That wasn't him.

449
00:39:29,158 --> 00:39:31,409
He was too tall.

450
00:39:31,494 --> 00:39:36,081
Too military. Wrong build. Too young.
A million reasons. It wasn't him.

451
00:39:36,165 --> 00:39:38,291
What the hell were we doing chasing this guy?

452
00:39:38,376 --> 00:39:41,711
He ran. I figured he'd be arrested for something.

to someone's house for dinner.

I, uh, I never Iearned how to do it right.

460
00:40:27,758 --> 00:40:32,011
Well, it's easy. You just smile and
nod and tell me how good it is.

Yes, ma'am.

Ma'am? Did you hear that?

463
00:40:36,559 --> 00:40:38,143
Well, right this way, sir.

464
00:40:38,227 --> 00:40:41,438
Let me welcome you to our humble commode.

Wanna help me get dinner ready?

Dinner ready?

468
00:41:02,418 --> 00:41:04,836
I'm not gonna be much help. I'm sorry.

469
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:07,881
It's easy. Just move the dad from
the backyard to the kitchen.

470
00:41:07,965 --> 00:41:09,966
That's your dad? Let's see.

471
00:41:12,428 --> 00:41:15,513
Hey, Paul. Come meet this Iittle guy.

[chuckles]

473
00:41:17,475 --> 00:41:19,184
It's Nicholas.

474
00:41:19,268 --> 00:41:21,519
Wow.

475
00:41:21,604 --> 00:41:23,855
Yeah. Looks Iike you.

476
00:41:23,939 --> 00:41:25,064
No.

477
00:41:25,149 --> 00:41:26,691
Yeah. Got your nose.

478
00:41:26,775 --> 00:41:28,860
Everyone says he Iooks Iike my dad.

479
00:41:28,944 --> 00:41:31,571
Which is nice 'cause we Iost him Iike ten years ago.

480
00:41:31,655 --> 00:41:33,072
Yeah, I'm sorry.

481
00:41:33,157 --> 00:41:34,365
No, no, it's fine.

482
00:41:34,450 --> 00:41:35,867
He's definitely your kid.

483
00:41:35,951 --> 00:41:37,535
Do you have any children, Paul?

484
00:41:37,620 --> 00:41:39,245
No. No, I don't.

485
00:41:39,330 --> 00:41:40,538
Do you want a drink?

486
00:41:40,623 --> 00:41:42,373
Yeah.

487
00:41:42,458 --> 00:41:44,751
Yeah, sweetie. Come on.

488
00:41:44,835 --> 00:41:46,544
You got his head?

489
00:41:46,629 --> 00:41:48,755
Come on, Lucy. Let's go set up, sweetie.

490
00:41:48,839 --> 00:41:50,423
Paul, what are you Iooking for?

491
00:41:50,508 --> 00:41:52,050
Vodka martini?

492
00:41:52,134 --> 00:41:53,760
Sure.

Dry. With, uh, an onion if you've got it.

494
00:41:55,804 --> 00:41:57,722
You know what?

495
00:41:57,806 --> 00:42:00,725
I think you've been chasing Cassius a Iittle too Iong.

496
00:42:00,809 --> 00:42:03,019
That's his drink.

497
00:42:05,689 --> 00:42:08,608
Yeah. Well, trying to get into his head...

498
00:42:08,692 --> 00:42:12,070
I guess I picked up some of his habits.

499
00:42:12,154 --> 00:42:15,448
You know what? In that case, I'm gonna join you.

500
00:42:21,830 --> 00:42:24,791
The kids are down. Finally.

501
00:42:27,670 --> 00:42:29,921
Now, I know you're gonna say this is weird...

502
00:42:30,005 --> 00:42:34,092
but I feel a connection with him. I do. With Cassius.

503
00:42:34,176 --> 00:42:36,928
He's not the kind of guy that you can connect to.

504
00:42:37,012 --> 00:42:41,766
Well, sure. If not a connection, then
a tremendous amount of respect.

505
00:42:41,850 --> 00:42:44,435
AII right. Let's just set the record straight now.

506
00:42:44,520 --> 00:42:47,313
He's not worthy of your respect or admiration.

507
00:42:47,398 --> 00:42:49,274
He's a cold-blooded ki//er.

508
00:42:49,358 --> 00:42:51,985
He doesn't have a family like you.

509
00:42:52,069 --> 00:42:54,612
He doesn't have a wife Iike yours.

510
00:42:54,697 --> 00:42:56,948
His Iife meant nothing.

511
00:42:57,032 --> 00:43:02,453
The only good thing he ever
did was disappear. All right?

512
00:43:02,538 --> 00:43:05,790
You don't think there's something
to be respected in the fact that...

513
00:43:05,874 --> 00:43:08,001
he is the best at something?

514
00:43:08,085 --> 00:43:12,338
Respect is the Iast thing I have
for an animal Iike him. Okay?

515
00:43:12,423 --> 00:43:14,132
Yeah. But--

516
00:43:15,926 --> 00:43:19,137
Hold that thought. I'm gonna take a piss.

517
00:43:19,221 --> 00:43:21,639
Ben?

518
00:43:21,724 --> 00:43:23,808
I'm just stating the facts.

519
00:43:25,603 --> 00:43:27,145
Paul, he's obsessed.

520
00:43:27,229 --> 00:43:28,813
Yeah, I know.

521
00:43:28,897 --> 00:43:31,149
And he has been ever since I've known him.

522
00:43:31,233 --> 00:43:33,192
Cassius.

523
00:43:33,277 --> 00:43:35,153
And you!

524
00:43:35,237 --> 00:43:39,407
You know, I'm-I'm just ready for it to be over.

525
00:43:44,246 --> 00:43:48,333
Your husband is messing with a creature...

526
00:43:48,417 --> 00:43:51,669
he thinks he understands, but he doesn't.

527
00:43:51,754 --> 00:43:55,006
He's allowed your husband...

528
00:43:55,090 --> 00:43:59,510
to Iive this Iong because he wasn't much of a threat.

529
00:43:59,595 --> 00:44:02,555
What do you mean, allowed him to Iive?

530
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:05,141
Do you think he knows who my husband is?

531
00:44:08,646 --> 00:44:10,647
I'm sure he does.

532
00:44:12,608 --> 00:44:15,151
You really read my thesis?

533
00:44:16,612 --> 00:44:19,864
Yes. Yes, I read your thesis.

534
00:44:19,948 --> 00:44:21,866
Yeah?

535
00:44:21,950 --> 00:44:23,618
And?

536
00:44:26,497 --> 00:44:28,665
AII right. I think...

537
00:44:30,459 --> 00:44:34,253
that you missed an essential question.

538
00:44:34,338 --> 00:44:37,048
Okay. What's that?

539
00:44:37,132 --> 00:44:40,885
You pinpointed the wheres and the hows of Cassius...

540
00:44:40,969 --> 00:44:44,389
but you never ask the question why.

541
00:44:44,473 --> 00:44:48,726
Why were his targets increasingly more random?

542
00:44:48,811 --> 00:44:50,895
Why did he disappear?

543
00:44:50,979 --> 00:44:54,232
When you can answer those whys...

544
00:44:54,316 --> 00:44:56,192
then you'll know him.

545
00:45:11,500 --> 00:45:14,252
Thank Natalie again, will you?

546
00:45:14,336 --> 00:45:17,130
Oh, we checked the calls from the hospital.

547
00:45:17,214 --> 00:45:18,297
Yeah?

548
00:45:18,382 --> 00:45:21,092
Nothing.

549
00:45:21,176 --> 00:45:22,802
Tch. Too bad.

550
00:45:22,886 --> 00:45:25,430
Yeah.

551
00:45:25,514 --> 00:45:27,473
See, you know the thing that--

552
00:45:27,558 --> 00:45:29,684
Okay, here's what I don't understand.

553
00:45:29,768 --> 00:45:33,146
How did Cassius know that they
moved Brutus to a hospital...

554
00:45:33,230 --> 00:45:35,606
instead of just working on him at the prison?

555
00:45:35,691 --> 00:45:39,777
The Russians probably paid somebody off in the prison.

556
00:45:39,862 --> 00:45:42,321
They'd want him dead just to shut him up.

557
00:45:42,406 --> 00:45:44,323
Right. Right.

558
00:45:44,408 --> 00:45:45,950
Good night, Geary.

559
00:45:52,583 --> 00:45:55,293
[dog barking]

[helicopter flying by]

561
00:46:29,787 --> 00:46:32,538
Gentlemen?

562
00:46:32,623 --> 00:46:34,832
I think you guys know Martin Miller.

563
00:46:34,917 --> 00:46:37,376
He's our Chief Analyst on domestic Russian ops.

564
00:46:37,461 --> 00:46:40,171
Go ahead, Marty.

565
00:46:40,255 --> 00:46:44,342
Almost six months ago, two B.P agents
were murdered and their truck stolen.

566
00:46:44,426 --> 00:46:48,179
The truck was located a week later in
a parking lot near TUS wiped clean.

567
00:46:48,263 --> 00:46:51,390
Now, these guys were smart. They parked
far enough away from the cameras...

568
00:46:51,475 --> 00:46:53,893
that we couldn't get any facial recognition.

569
00:46:53,977 --> 00:46:56,854
Local cops and Border Patrol
assumed they were Mexican.

570
00:46:56,939 --> 00:46:59,148
Then we found this.

571
00:47:00,442 --> 00:47:02,568
A camera in a squad car.

572
00:47:02,653 --> 00:47:05,238
That's right. Luckily, Tucson police were testing...

573
00:47:05,322 --> 00:47:07,740
high-resolution cameras in a few cars.

574
00:47:07,825 --> 00:47:10,910
All Russian. All known operatives.

575
00:47:10,994 --> 00:47:13,704
AII now in the United States.

576
00:47:13,789 --> 00:47:16,415
(Geary) There's the guy with the Russian jacket.

577
00:47:16,500 --> 00:47:18,501
That's right. And it gets better.

578
00:47:25,300 --> 00:47:27,426
Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait.

579
00:47:35,978 --> 00:47:37,520
Son-of-a-bitch.

580
00:47:39,982 --> 00:47:41,399
Bozlovski.

581
00:47:41,483 --> 00:47:43,609
That's right. Johann Bozlovski.

582
00:47:43,694 --> 00:47:47,238
Former Spetsnaz and KGB.

583
00:47:47,322 --> 00:47:51,868
In 1990, Bozlovski and his 10th Mountain
Brigade in the Black Caucasus...

584
00:47:51,910 --> 00:47:55,746
went into Warsaw and executed known
allies of the solidarity movement.

585
00:47:55,831 --> 00:47:59,125
I Iooked for him for a year...

00:47:59,209 --> 00:48:01,127
after the wall came down.

587
00:48:01,211 --> 00:48:03,713
He just, just vanished.

588
00:48:08,010 --> 00:48:09,927
Like Cassius.

589
00:48:10,012 --> 00:48:11,888
What are you thinking, Paul?

590
00:48:13,348 --> 00:48:15,600
We have a known Soviet hit man.

591
00:48:15,684 --> 00:48:19,270
Disappears into Libya or Afghanistan.

592
00:48:19,354 --> 00:48:22,273
Same time our intel tells us Cassius does the same.

593
00:48:22,357 --> 00:48:24,483
Twenty years Iater, he shows up.

597
00:48:33,535 --> 00:48:35,953
And... he's so visible.

598
00:48:36,038 --> 00:48:39,457
Well, yeah. Maybe that's what they wanted.

599
00:48:39,541 --> 00:48:42,627
And wouldn't a more visible alter ego...

600
00:48:42,711 --> 00:48:45,296
just muddy up the waters for everyone chasing him?

601
00:48:45,380 --> 00:48:49,800
How did we know Boz was in Warsaw in 1990?

602
00:48:49,885 --> 00:48:51,469
How did we know that?

603
00:48:51,553 --> 00:48:54,138
Because the Russians told us so!

604
00:48:54,222 --> 00:48:57,308
Soviet disinformation was the
biggest weapon they had...

605
00:48:57,392 --> 00:48:58,976
before the wall came down.

606
00:48:59,061 --> 00:49:00,478

Bozlovski makes sense.

Nothing. Nothing. He'll disappear again...

Please. Please don't.

659
00:53:44,512 --> 00:53:45,930
Where is he?

660
00:53:46,014 --> 00:53:47,765
I am begging you. I don't know.

661
00:53:47,849 --> 00:53:50,267
Bullshit. That is bullshit.

662
00:53:50,352 --> 00:53:52,436
Paul, we broke into her place! Okay?

663
00:53:52,520 --> 00:53:54,313
Go back to the car and shut up!

664
00:53:54,397 --> 00:53:55,648
Where is he?

665
00:53:55,732 --> 00:53:57,483
Please.

666
00:53:57,567 --> 00:54:00,653
Paul, Iet me talk to her!

667
00:54:00,737 --> 00:54:02,279
Please.

668
00:54:02,364 --> 00:54:04,990
[groans]

669
00:54:05,075 --> 00:54:07,743
Please, I don't know anything.

670
00:54:14,209 --> 00:54:16,126
You're a very Iucky girl.

671
00:54:18,880 --> 00:54:20,089
Come.

672
00:54:45,949 --> 00:54:47,992
[talking in Russian]

673
00:54:57,252 --> 00:55:01,171
You didn't really show her pictures
of your kids, did you?

674
00:55:01,256 --> 00:55:04,341
You know, they teach you a couple tricks at Quantico.

675
00:55:04,426 --> 00:55:07,428
Oh, Quantico. Good cop, bad cop.

676
00:55:10,932 --> 00:55:12,224
Making a connection.

677
00:55:12,309 --> 00:55:14,685
Oh! Very nice.

678
00:55:14,769 --> 00:55:16,020
Yeah?

679
00:55:39,294 --> 00:55:40,836
[talking in Russian]

680
00:55:47,469 --> 00:55:51,889
I, uh, I know-- I know this man you're Iooking for.

681
00:55:51,973 --> 00:55:54,141
Okay? You-you can follow me there.

682
00:55:56,019 --> 00:55:57,519
Who are you?

683
00:55:59,856 --> 00:56:01,273
Her brother.

684
00:56:01,358 --> 00:56:03,067
Oh.

685
00:56:03,151 --> 00:56:06,070
Look, I take you to where Bozlovski is.

686
00:56:06,154 --> 00:56:08,238
What's your name?

687
00:56:08,323 --> 00:56:09,615
Leo.

688
00:56:09,699 --> 00:56:11,450
Leo. Leo, give me your phone.

689
00:56:11,534 --> 00:56:13,077
Give me your phone.

690
00:56:14,329 --> 00:56:16,580
There you go.

691
00:56:16,664 --> 00:56:20,751
Now, Leo, you didn't call anyone and
tell them we were coming, did you?

692
00:56:20,835 --> 00:56:24,254
No. No, no. No, I swear.

693
00:56:24,339 --> 00:56:29,134
Now, if anything goes wrong, Leo, I'm
putting two bullets in her head...

694
00:56:29,219 --> 00:56:32,554
and I'm dumping her in the river.
Then I'm coming for you.

695
00:56:35,350 --> 00:56:39,561
Okay.

696
00:56:57,205 --> 00:56:59,748
You're gonna shoot her in the head?

697
00:57:01,751 --> 00:57:03,669
Just making a connection.

698
00:57:21,604 --> 00:57:23,856
Okay. This is the place.

699
00:57:23,940 --> 00:57:26,483
Okay, Bozlovski, he's in there.

700
00:57:26,568 --> 00:57:28,569
No, no, no. No, no, come on.

701
00:57:44,627 --> 00:57:46,628
Leo! Hey.

702
00:57:47,922 --> 00:57:49,214
How many girls you got?

703
00:57:49,299 --> 00:57:52,050
Come on, tell me. Five? Ten?

704
00:57:52,135 --> 00:57:55,220
Fifteen? Talk to me. Huh?

705
00:57:56,973 --> 00:57:58,223
Two.

706
00:57:58,308 --> 00:57:59,516
What?

707
00:57:59,601 --> 00:58:04,021
Two.

708
00:58:05,815 --> 00:58:07,232
AII right.

709
00:58:07,317 --> 00:58:09,401
You get me to Bozlovski...

710
00:58:09,486 --> 00:58:11,862
you keep your business...

711
00:58:11,946 --> 00:58:14,865
and we never met. AII right?

712
00:58:14,949 --> 00:58:19,244
You. Call for backup, or whatever
they told you to do at Quantico.

713
00:58:19,329 --> 00:58:21,663
You stay there by the door. You don't Ieave.

714
00:58:23,166 --> 00:58:24,416
Go.

715
00:58:24,501 --> 00:58:26,043
He comes, too?

716
00:58:26,127 --> 00:58:28,003
No, no, he stays at the door. Go on.

717
00:58:39,349 --> 00:58:44,269
Perfect. Because I was first in
my class in door watching.

718
00:59:28,523 --> 00:59:31,108
[talking in Russian]

719
00:59:31,192 --> 00:59:33,485
I hear you've been asking questions about me.

720
00:59:33,570 --> 00:59:35,654
You know my name.

721
00:59:35,738 --> 00:59:37,656
Johann.

722
00:59:37,740 --> 00:59:39,866
[door closes]

723
00:59:41,703 --> 00:59:44,496
Coming in through Mexico, smart. Very smart.

724
00:59:44,581 --> 00:59:47,791
How do you know this? What agency are you with?

725
00:59:47,875 --> 00:59:50,586
They say you killed a Senator.

726
00:59:52,547 --> 00:59:54,673
They think you're Cassius.

727
00:59:54,757 --> 00:59:56,633
[whistles]

728
00:59:56,718 --> 01:00:00,137
Uh-oh.

729
01:00:00,221 --> 01:00:01,680
[chuckles]

730
01:00:01,764 --> 01:00:03,807
What do you think?

731
01:00:03,891 --> 01:00:08,312
You think I'm stupid enough to call
ahead from my own phone?

732
01:00:08,396 --> 01:00:11,982
You think I give a damn what happens to some whore?

733
01:00:12,066 --> 01:00:15,819
Yes. I've played Cassius before.

734
01:00:15,903 --> 01:00:20,657
If they want me to be Cassius, I become Cassius.

735
01:00:20,742 --> 01:00:22,618
But you're not him.

736
01:00:25,413 --> 01:00:26,872
Really?

737
01:00:31,628 --> 01:00:33,295
How can you be so sure?

738
01:00:35,757 --> 01:00:37,841
Because I'm Cassius.

739
01:00:49,145 --> 01:00:52,397
[shooting]

740
01:00:54,442 --> 01:00:55,484
[groans]

741
01:01:30,812 --> 01:01:33,480
[clap of thunder]

742
01:01:38,194 --> 01:01:40,404
[siren blaring]

743
01:01:40,488 --> 01:01:42,864
[muffled voices]

744
01:01:46,994 --> 01:01:48,578
You were here?

745
01:01:48,663 --> 01:01:50,205
Yes, sir.

746
01:01:53,835 --> 01:01:56,628
And I ran immediately upstairs.

747
01:01:56,713 --> 01:01:58,839
[indistinct radio]

748
01:02:09,684 --> 01:02:12,602
[dialing]

749
01:02:18,234 --> 01:02:21,027
[telephone ringing]

750
01:02:38,045 --> 01:02:41,631
Hey. OIIie. Come on. You did the work
on the Moussali capture, right?

751
01:02:41,716 --> 01:02:44,634
Applied some Iike theoretical geography
to his whereabouts?

752
01:02:44,719 --> 01:02:46,803
Yeah, that's right. Tracking a fugitive...

753
01:02:46,888 --> 01:02:49,681
is essentially the same thing as tracking
an endangered species.

754
01:02:49,766 --> 01:02:51,975
You rule out the places they can't or won't go...

755
01:02:52,059 --> 01:02:54,186
until you have a reasonably few places to Iook.

756
01:02:54,270 --> 01:02:56,021
You want in on this thing? Come on.

757
01:02:57,899 --> 01:03:00,484
So, what is it I'm Iooking for?

758
01:03:00,568 --> 01:03:04,154
Late in Cassius' career, his murders
were no longer just pro-Soviet.

759
01:03:04,238 --> 01:03:05,989
He was killing Russians, too.

760
01:03:06,073 --> 01:03:08,492
And also English, Polish, Czech, you name it.

761
01:03:08,576 --> 01:03:10,160
When was this?

762
01:03:10,244 --> 01:03:12,662
Around 1988.

763
01:03:12,747 --> 01:03:14,623
It never made any sense.

764
01:03:16,918 --> 01:03:19,544
I think I missed something here.

765
01:03:19,629 --> 01:03:21,713
Why do you think you missed something?

766
01:03:21,798 --> 01:03:23,840
You have some new information?

767
01:03:23,925 --> 01:03:25,884
Paul Shepherdson.

768
01:03:25,968 --> 01:03:28,470
Yeah?

769
01:03:30,264 --> 01:03:31,640
What?

770
01:03:33,601 --> 01:03:36,061
He's been at the company for Iike 25 years!

771
01:03:36,145 --> 01:03:38,522
Yeah, I know, man. That's why
I need you on this. Okay?

772
01:03:38,606 --> 01:03:40,565
I've been over this shit Iike a thousand times...

773
01:03:40,650 --> 01:03:43,026
to the point at which I always
see the exact same thing.

774
01:03:43,110 --> 01:03:45,862
Find something different.

775
01:03:48,491 --> 01:03:51,701
Okay. Yeah, sure. I--

776
01:03:51,786 --> 01:03:55,580
But if you're right, I mean, that
means the entire time...

777
01:03:55,665 --> 01:03:59,042
he's been hunting himself?

778
01:03:59,126 --> 01:04:00,710
So, he killed the Senator?

779
01:04:00,795 --> 01:04:03,004
If we're right about this, yeah.

780
01:04:05,466 --> 01:04:08,051
[telephone rings]

781
01:04:08,135 --> 01:04:09,886
Agent Geary.

782
01:04:09,971 --> 01:04:11,763
I've got a question about a file here.

783
01:04:11,848 --> 01:04:14,057
It's blue and it's got a note attached that says...

784
01:04:14,141 --> 01:04:15,934
"Too many questions. Not Cassius."

785
01:04:16,018 --> 01:04:17,561
Uh, No. That one's a hoax.

786
01:04:17,645 --> 01:04:20,105
It's like a crude copycat murder.

787
01:04:20,189 --> 01:04:21,565
Okay, cool. I'll exclude it.

788
01:04:21,649 --> 01:04:24,109
[squeaking]

789
01:04:28,489 --> 01:04:30,740
I'm gonna run for coffee. Want something?

790
01:04:30,825 --> 01:04:32,951
Oh, no. I'm fine, thank you.

791
01:04:34,537 --> 01:04:36,746
[door opens]

792
01:04:38,875 --> 01:04:40,458
[door closes]

[soft music]

794
01:05:12,867 --> 01:05:14,117
[grunts]

795
01:05:17,204 --> 01:05:18,788
Ooh.

796
01:05:18,873 --> 01:05:20,248
Jesus!

797
01:05:21,876 --> 01:05:24,169
Paul! Hi! Thank you!

798
01:05:24,253 --> 01:05:25,629
You need to be careful.

799
01:05:25,713 --> 01:05:27,464
Yeah. Oh, Iet me--

800
01:05:27,548 --> 01:05:29,174
Stay up there. [clears throat]

801
01:05:29,258 --> 01:05:32,844
Okay.

802
01:05:32,929 --> 01:05:36,973
I want you to tell your husband to ask off this case.

803
01:05:37,058 --> 01:05:40,477
Have him say that it's just too
much for him, for his family.

804
01:05:40,561 --> 01:05:43,855
What-whatever he has to say, just get him out.

805
01:05:43,940 --> 01:05:45,815
Paul, what do you expect me to do?

806
01:05:45,900 --> 01:05:48,026
You know, I told you. I can't watch over him anymore.

807
01:05:48,110 --> 01:05:50,153
He's getting very close to a dangerous man.

808
01:05:50,237 --> 01:05:52,030
He won't Iisten to me.

809
01:05:52,114 --> 01:05:53,990
He won't Iisten to anything I have to say, so--

810
01:05:54,075 --> 01:05:56,493
He's gonna die, Natalie!

811
01:05:56,577 --> 01:05:58,328
What?

812
01:05:58,412 --> 01:05:59,955
Do you hear me now?

813
01:06:02,083 --> 01:06:04,668
Cassius has taken out men...

814
01:06:04,752 --> 01:06:06,670
much more experienced than Ben.

815
01:06:06,754 --> 01:06:09,839
He doesn't give a damn about you, about your family.

816
01:06:09,924 --> 01:06:12,175
He will kill your husband.

817
01:06:12,259 --> 01:06:14,135
Like snapping his fingers.

818
01:06:25,314 --> 01:06:27,399
And he will feel nothing.

819
01:06:43,791 --> 01:06:47,877
I pieced together the photos of every murder
and I laid them out chronologically.

820
01:06:47,962 --> 01:06:50,213
Oh, that red Iine right there indicates...

821
01:06:50,297 --> 01:06:52,757
where his killing became erratic and inexplicable.

822
01:06:52,842 --> 01:06:56,386
So, all you've gotta do is set up a null
hypothesis and try and prove it.

823
01:06:56,470 --> 01:06:59,723
And when you can't prove it, that means
your original hypothesis must be true.

824
01:06:59,807 --> 01:07:00,932
Wait, wait.

825
01:07:01,017 --> 01:07:03,226
Take some fact.

826
01:07:03,310 --> 01:07:06,062
You said you believe Cassius returns
to the scene of the crimes.

827
01:07:06,147 --> 01:07:08,231
And you've got photos of every murder.

828
01:07:08,315 --> 01:07:11,109
So set up a hypothesis of, say,
Stephen Hawking is Cassius...

829
01:07:11,193 --> 01:07:14,738
which gives you a null hypothesis of
Stephen Hawking is not Cassius.

830
01:07:14,822 --> 01:07:17,240
So, go through the photos and try and prove the null...

831
01:07:17,324 --> 01:07:19,993
that Rolling Thunder is not Cassius.

832
01:07:20,077 --> 01:07:22,912
If you can, that means your hypothesis
is incorrect. If you can't...

833
01:07:22,997 --> 01:07:24,956
then depending on your "P" value of course...

834
01:07:25,041 --> 01:07:27,625
you've statistically proven your
hypothesis must be true.

835
01:07:27,710 --> 01:07:30,754
Or that Stephen Hawking is Cassius.

836
01:07:30,838 --> 01:07:32,964
Yeah.

837
01:07:33,049 --> 01:07:36,801
Some of us didn't sleep our way through
Logic and Stats at Harvard.

838
01:07:36,886 --> 01:07:38,970
Damn, this coffee really works.

839
01:07:39,055 --> 01:07:40,597
I'll be right back.

[whispers] Hey.

842
01:10:26,847 --> 01:10:28,723
Hey.

843
01:10:30,559 --> 01:10:33,269
Hey. Come here, big guy.

844
01:10:33,354 --> 01:10:35,438
He misses his daddy.

845
01:10:35,522 --> 01:10:37,106
Yeah?

846
01:10:46,700 --> 01:10:48,952
Sweetie, what is it?

847
01:10:49,036 --> 01:10:51,829
No, just, you know how much
I care about you guys, right?

848
01:10:51,914 --> 01:10:56,125
Oh, God. Yeah. I do.

849
01:10:56,210 --> 01:10:59,003
Ben?

850
01:11:04,760 --> 01:11:06,344
I just--

851
01:11:09,098 --> 01:11:12,350
I-I just came home to tell you
I've got to pull an all-nighter.

852
01:11:15,771 --> 01:11:17,480
It's all gonna be over soon.

853
01:11:17,564 --> 01:11:18,815
Yeah.

854
01:11:21,068 --> 01:11:22,652
Ben.

855
01:11:22,736 --> 01:11:24,445
Yeah?

856
01:11:25,739 --> 01:11:28,533
You know, Paul told me--

857
01:11:28,617 --> 01:11:31,369
Paul? When were you talking to Paul?

858
01:11:31,453 --> 01:11:35,373
Well, he came by the store today and
he told me how dangerous this all is.

859
01:11:35,457 --> 01:11:40,211
Honey. Don't Iisten to a word that that guy says, okay?

860
01:11:40,296 --> 01:11:43,715
He's just an old man who thinks
that the war is still cold.

861
01:11:43,799 --> 01:11:47,677
Trust me. This is all gonna be over soon.

862
01:11:47,761 --> 01:11:49,387
You promise?

863
01:11:49,471 --> 01:11:51,431
Yeah. But I-I gotta go.

864
01:11:57,146 --> 01:11:59,188
Natalie?

865
01:12:06,280 --> 01:12:08,323
It's-- Never mind.

866
01:12:38,479 --> 01:12:42,065
I dug deeper into Bozlovski's Iife Iike you asked.

867
01:12:42,149 --> 01:12:46,277
The guy's nothing but a killing
machine. Anywhere. Anytime.

868
01:12:46,362 --> 01:12:48,905
He's used every single weapon you can think of...

869
01:12:48,989 --> 01:12:52,784
from an M-24 from 800 meters to a rusty nail.

870
01:13:52,719 --> 01:13:55,930
Where was he June 1988?

871
01:14:02,604 --> 01:14:06,774
We had him flying into Geneva as
an Irishman named Ted O'Leary.

872
01:14:09,236 --> 01:14:10,945
He was there for four days.

873
01:14:14,741 --> 01:14:19,787
Where are you?

874
01:14:23,083 --> 01:14:24,959
Holy shit.

875
01:14:26,128 --> 01:14:28,045
Bozlovski?

876

[siren blaring]

877
01:15:38,992 --> 01:15:40,535
Hm.

878
01:15:59,012 --> 01:16:01,055
Oh, my God.

879
01:16:03,183 --> 01:16:05,560
Bozlovski killed your family.

880
01:16:08,689 --> 01:16:10,982
So, all this time...

881
01:16:17,030 --> 01:16:19,240
you were Iooking for revenge.

884
01:16:53,734 --> 01:16:56,485
Where are you?

885
01:16:56,570 --> 01:16:58,654
You got my message on your windshield.

886
01:16:58,739 --> 01:17:00,823
I know the truth.

887
01:17:00,907 --> 01:17:03,492
You've been Iooking for Cassius
a Iong time, haven't you?

888
01:17:03,577 --> 01:17:06,203
Yeah. And now I've found him.

889
01:17:06,288 --> 01:17:08,956
It would seem so.

890
01:17:29,269 --> 01:17:31,520
Where is Paul Shepherdson?

891
01:17:31,605 --> 01:17:35,524
Hey! You wanna keep your business your business?

892
01:17:35,609 --> 01:17:38,194
Or do you want every Fed in the
District down here up your ass?

893
01:17:38,278 --> 01:17:40,655
So, goddammit, Where is he?

894
01:17:55,796 --> 01:17:58,589
Good to go.

895
01:17:58,674 --> 01:18:00,883
All right, open it up!

[shooting]

897
01:20:29,115 --> 01:20:30,324
What happened?

898
01:20:32,494 --> 01:20:36,205
Open the gate! Open the goddamn gate! Now!

899
01:20:36,289 --> 01:20:37,581
Come on!

900
01:20:43,338 --> 01:20:45,005

01:21:21,501 --> 01:21:24,086
How did I miss it, Paul?

903
01:21:24,170 --> 01:21:26,422
How did I miss it?

904
01:21:26,506 --> 01:21:29,592
The entire time, Cassius was right next to me!

905
01:21:29,676 --> 01:21:31,135
Put the gun down, Geary!

906
01:21:31,219 --> 01:21:33,137
What? I'm supposed to trust you now?

907
01:21:33,221 --> 01:21:37,057
Yeah. Let's talk about trust.

908
01:21:41,229 --> 01:21:43,272
Five down! Cassius.

909
01:21:43,356 --> 01:21:46,650
Seventy across. Yepatb!

910
01:21:46,735 --> 01:21:48,652
Eliminated.

911
01:21:48,737 --> 01:21:51,447
Thirty-two down. Bolxoh.

912
01:21:51,531 --> 01:21:53,782
Exit.

913
01:21:53,867 --> 01:21:57,328
This is 30-year-old Soviet code.

914
01:21:57,412 --> 01:22:00,164
So, how old were you when-when
your family came over here?

915
01:22:00,248 --> 01:22:03,959
What were you, about ten? Ten?

916
01:22:04,044 --> 01:22:07,296
You never had a choice, did you?

917
01:22:07,380 --> 01:22:09,673
So then you wrote a thesis that couldn't be ignored.

918
01:22:09,758 --> 01:22:12,009
The FBI came after you. They signed you up.

919
01:22:12,093 --> 01:22:15,137
You even started a family. You started a real family!

920
01:22:15,221 --> 01:22:17,222
To make it stick.

921
01:22:21,102 --> 01:22:23,646
You've been a double your whole Iife.

922
01:22:47,587 --> 01:22:52,341
You cut the Senator's neck because
you knew you were the expert...

923
01:22:54,427 --> 01:22:57,388
who could convince the Americans
it was Cassius who did it.

924
01:22:59,474 --> 01:23:03,352
An investigation would flush Cassius out.

925
01:23:05,271 --> 01:23:07,982
My orders are to kill you...

926
01:23:09,442 --> 01:23:11,193
and return to Moscow.

01:23:38,346 --> 01:23:40,347
Cassius.

931
01:23:43,810 --> 01:23:46,520
Cassius is getting away.

932
01:24:22,891 --> 01:24:25,059
Hey, Iisten to me.

933
01:24:26,519 --> 01:24:28,604
He's wounded. He's cornered.

934
01:24:28,688 --> 01:24:31,106
He's not gonna talk. He's not gonna play fair.

935
01:24:31,191 --> 01:24:33,442
He's not gonna be taken alive.

936
01:24:33,526 --> 01:24:35,694
Right.

Bozlovski's the one with the slit throat.

953
01:30:00,895 --> 01:30:02,896
I heard a shot.

954
01:30:05,525 --> 01:30:08,568
And when I turned around, I saw Paul going down.

955
01:30:10,696 --> 01:30:15,283
But not before he'd gotten Cassius'
own wire around his neck.

956
01:30:15,368 --> 01:30:17,828
Cassius shot Paul?

957
01:30:21,040 --> 01:30:23,333
The ballistics will prove it.

958
01:30:27,922 --> 01:30:30,590
But not before Paul finally got his man.

959
01:30:33,052 --> 01:30:34,344
That's right.

960
01:30:35,721 --> 01:30:37,389
Well done, Agent Geary.

962
