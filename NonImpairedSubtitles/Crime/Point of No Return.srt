Yeah, why don't you think about it?

91
00:12:00,031 --> 00:12:01,498
You've got one hour.

00:12:38,102 --> 00:12:40,400
Stupid fucking asshoIe!

93
00:12:44,108 --> 00:12:45,735
Come on, up! Up!

00:12:46,177 --> 00:12:47,576

-Who are these asshoIes?
-Just peopIe who work here. It's okay.

Put it away!

101
00:13:08,499 --> 00:13:09,989
Go back to your work.

102
00:13:12,103 --> 00:13:13,764
Everything's under controI.

103
00:13:15,506 --> 00:13:17,098
-Open it!
-I can't!

104
00:13:18,009 --> 00:13:20,500
-Open the fucking door!
-Shit, I can't.

105
00:13:20,611 --> 00:13:22,704
-Tell them to do it!
-They won't.

00:13:40,965 --> 00:13:42,023
Come on, Maggie.

112
00:13:42,467 --> 00:13:44,958
You're too smart to fight these odds.

113
00:13:46,104 --> 00:13:47,230
It's okay.

114
00:13:47,305 --> 00:13:48,966
It's okay. Put it down.

115
00:13:57,749 --> 00:13:59,239
RuIe number one:

116
00:13:59,650 --> 00:14:01,709
Never chamber the first round.

117
00:14:05,490 --> 00:14:07,822
That'll sIow you down for a whlle...

118
00:14:08,659 --> 00:14:10,251

Everything ready?

120
00:14:18,669 --> 00:14:20,660
One, two, three--

121
00:14:40,258 --> 00:14:41,520
So?

122
00:14:42,527 --> 00:14:44,358
What's it to be, yes or no?

123
00:14:45,430 --> 00:14:49,423
What if I said I have a coupIe of questions
and that I need some more time?

124
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:51,365
What if I said there is no more time?

125
00:14:51,436 --> 00:14:54,530
What if I said you can kiss my ass
right in the crack?

126
00:14:55,940 --> 00:14:58,101
What's it gonna be, yes or no?

127
00:15:06,851 --> 00:15:09,376
I'm gonna have a few things that I'll need.

128
00:15:11,055 --> 00:15:12,784
I'm gonna need some stuff.

129
00:15:13,491 --> 00:15:14,856
I need some music.

130
00:15:16,894 --> 00:15:18,225
Some good music.

131
00:15:18,729 --> 00:15:20,720
I'm gonna want some Nina Simone.

132
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:24,095
Nina Simone.

133
00:15:27,305 --> 00:15:28,829
Yeah, and....

And I want some more pain kllIers.

135
00:15:35,847 --> 00:15:37,906
My Ieg is fuckin' kllllng me.

00:15:46,924 --> 00:15:48,016

137
00:15:48,426 --> 00:15:49,757
I'll make a llst.

138
00:15:51,829 --> 00:15:53,319
You do that, Maggie.

139
00:15:54,599 --> 00:15:56,260
Bet your fuckin' ass.

140
00:16:05,610 --> 00:16:08,044
We're gonna start
with a simpIe program first.

141
00:16:08,112 --> 00:16:11,639
This is just llke a typewriter keyboard.
You got Ietters here...

142
00:16:11,816 --> 00:16:14,216
...numbers here, right? Return, okay?

143
00:16:14,619 --> 00:16:16,712
Tab-- Wait, wait, wait.

144
00:16:17,121 --> 00:16:18,554
This is a mouse.

145
00:16:18,656 --> 00:16:21,887
You use this to write with, draw, save,
things llke that.

146
00:16:21,959 --> 00:16:25,122
See the roller? Roll that around
and watch the screen.

147
00:16:25,363 --> 00:16:26,625
Good, good.

148
00:16:27,465 --> 00:16:28,454
Wait!

149
00:16:28,633 --> 00:16:31,124
Wait, wait. Real easy, okay?

150
00:16:31,302 --> 00:16:35,705
Real easy. Like that, okay? Now move
that arrow down to where it says, ''PIay.''

151
00:16:37,308 --> 00:16:38,900
Right here, cllck once.

152
00:16:44,248 --> 00:16:46,239
Pay attention, Maggie.

153
00:16:52,056 --> 00:16:56,117
-Can we make the dinosaur eat him?
-You want to make the dinosaur eat him?

154
00:17:00,398 --> 00:17:01,831
Very good, very good.

155
00:17:01,899 --> 00:17:04,163
FeeI a bit more relaxed.

156
00:17:06,637 --> 00:17:07,661
You.

157
00:17:09,507 --> 00:17:10,940
I can't. My Ieg hurts.

158
00:17:11,008 --> 00:17:14,842
That's okay. We're just working
on refIexes. It'll be easy. Come on.

159
00:17:25,022 --> 00:17:28,014
I've taken my guard.
See if you can hit my face.

160
00:17:31,929 --> 00:17:33,624
Hit me. Come on, hit me.

161
00:17:33,864 --> 00:17:35,798
Hit me. Hit me. Come on.

162
00:18:20,911 --> 00:18:23,141
AIways smlle
when you enter a room, dear.

163
00:18:23,214 --> 00:18:27,082
It relaxes others,
and it llfts the features of the face.

164
00:18:37,628 --> 00:18:40,756
You know what
''Nature's first green is goId'' means?

165
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:45,260
''Nature's first green is goId.''

166
00:18:49,273 --> 00:18:51,434
It means that the first is best...

167
00:18:52,543 --> 00:18:54,943
...that youth is better than oId age.

168
00:18:59,183 --> 00:19:02,880
You have the gift of youth.
That is what we'll bulld on.

169
00:19:08,459 --> 00:19:11,622
It's charming, my dear,
but it doesn't address my point.

170
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:17,799
Put the gum here.

171
00:19:34,585 --> 00:19:35,916
That's better.

172
00:19:36,987 --> 00:19:38,318
Sit down.

173
00:19:50,868 --> 00:19:52,733
Are you an ugIy duckllng...

174
00:19:53,170 --> 00:19:54,501
...or a swan?

175
00:19:54,905 --> 00:19:57,169
Because the choice is yours, you know.

176
00:19:59,810 --> 00:20:02,176
Bellef is half of being.

177
00:20:06,517 --> 00:20:09,509
It's a fancy way of saying,
if you belleve you're pretty...

178
00:20:09,587 --> 00:20:11,452
...then you wllI be pretty.

179
00:20:11,589 --> 00:20:12,954
You'll see.

180
00:20:15,926 --> 00:20:18,224
What do you do
when you're most uncomfortabIe?

181
00:20:18,295 --> 00:20:20,525
When you're angry or scared?

182
00:20:21,599 --> 00:20:22,964
I hit.

183
00:20:23,968 --> 00:20:25,902
You might want to try smlling.

184
00:20:25,970 --> 00:20:28,564
Just smlle a llttIe smlle and...

185
00:20:29,006 --> 00:20:32,942
...say something offhand.
It doesn't have to fit the situation, really.

186
00:20:34,378 --> 00:20:35,538
Say....

187
00:20:37,782 --> 00:20:40,979
Say, ''I never did mind
about the llttIe things.''

188
00:20:48,492 --> 00:20:49,481
Say it!

189
00:20:56,066 --> 00:20:57,624
PIease, dear.

190
00:20:58,002 --> 00:21:00,630
A smlle, and the sentence.

191
00:21:04,575 --> 00:21:06,736
''I never did mind....''

192
00:21:14,018 --> 00:21:16,509
''I never did mind...

193
00:21:17,087 --> 00:21:19,521
''...about the llttIe things.''

194
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:24,591
Chin up. Shoulders back.

195
00:21:24,728 --> 00:21:27,390
Yes. Have some pride in yourseIf.

196
00:21:27,665 --> 00:21:28,791
Show me.

197
00:21:28,899 --> 00:21:30,161
Nice, Maggie.

198
00:21:30,334 --> 00:21:31,767
Better. Good.

199
00:21:31,936 --> 00:21:34,427
''I lie down for a nap today. Yesterday...

200
00:21:34,605 --> 00:21:36,038
''...I Iay down for a nap.

201
00:21:36,106 --> 00:21:38,802
''If something unfortunate happens,
I feeI bad--''

202
00:21:38,976 --> 00:21:40,034
Louder, pIease.

203
00:21:40,110 --> 00:21:43,773
''I feeI bad about it, not badIy.
'Bad' is an adjective.

204
00:21:43,948 --> 00:21:48,612
''Remember to say, 'It is a secret
between her and me.' Not, 'she and I.'''

205
00:22:06,637 --> 00:22:09,470
Turn it down, wllI you?
PIease, turn it down.

206
00:22:09,807 --> 00:22:13,800
PeopIe are beginning to compIain.
Why don't you use the headset I got you?

207
00:22:14,078 --> 00:22:15,636
'Cause they're crappy.

208
00:22:21,585 --> 00:22:23,143
You know, you....

209
00:22:30,261 --> 00:22:32,593
This is Nina Simone.

210
00:22:34,298 --> 00:22:36,095
You got it for me, remember?

211
00:22:39,003 --> 00:22:40,834
She wants sugar in her bowI?

212
00:22:41,872 --> 00:22:43,737
No, she's saying:

213
00:22:44,008 --> 00:22:48,741
''Baby, just stick it in me twice a day,
and I'll do anything for you.

214
00:22:49,046 --> 00:22:51,412
''I'll llck the ground you walk on.''

215
00:22:53,651 --> 00:22:55,346
Why do you talk so dirty?

216
00:22:55,419 --> 00:22:57,148
Why do you talk so faggy?

217
00:23:01,158 --> 00:23:03,956
So, how is it going?

218
00:23:05,529 --> 00:23:08,089
Oh, man, I'm so majorIy bored.

219
00:23:09,033 --> 00:23:13,197
Think I'm going crazy. Started talking
to myseIf and all kinds of stuff.

220
00:23:13,837 --> 00:23:15,464
Well, your reports are excellent.

221
00:23:15,539 --> 00:23:16,767
All right!

222
00:23:17,675 --> 00:23:22,203
So what, do I get a reward or something?
It's my birthday next week.

223
00:23:22,646 --> 00:23:24,705
Why don't you Iet me go outside?

224
00:23:25,950 --> 00:23:27,383
Just for one night?

225
00:23:28,485 --> 00:23:30,180
You can have me followed.

226
00:23:34,391 --> 00:23:35,449
PIease!

227
00:23:35,526 --> 00:23:37,494
I can't. Okay?

228
00:23:43,467 --> 00:23:44,991
Look, Maggie...

229
00:23:46,904 --> 00:23:48,428
...I know how you feeI.

230
00:23:48,505 --> 00:23:50,302
-Bullshit!
-Yes, I do.

231
00:23:50,574 --> 00:23:52,735
I used to be a recruit myseIf.

232
00:23:53,177 --> 00:23:55,168
I used to be where you are now.

233
00:23:55,312 --> 00:23:58,304
And, just llke you,
I hated every moment of it.

234
00:24:00,084 --> 00:24:02,075
So you understand.

235
00:24:02,419 --> 00:24:06,378
I'm going stir-crazy. PIease!
Just Iet me go out for a walk.

236
00:24:07,691 --> 00:24:09,181
I said I can't.

237
00:24:09,526 --> 00:24:11,255
That's it. Okay?

238
00:24:24,008 --> 00:24:26,272
I want to go for a walk!

239
00:24:27,077 --> 00:24:28,408
Door number five?

240
00:24:28,512 --> 00:24:31,276
Take out the bad guys.
Do not shoot the good guys.

241
00:24:31,348 --> 00:24:33,509
You got two seconds for each target.

242
00:24:33,584 --> 00:24:34,812
Understand?

243
00:24:35,119 --> 00:24:36,518
Ready, set...

244
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:38,278
...and go.

245
00:24:54,138 --> 00:24:56,231
What was that?

246
00:24:57,041 --> 00:24:59,134
-Fun.
-Yeah, right.

247
00:24:59,376 --> 00:25:01,037
What is it with you?

248
00:25:03,580 --> 00:25:06,413
Eating shouId be gracefuI, yet natural.

249
00:25:06,683 --> 00:25:09,743
If you get a bone in your mouth,
take it out with the tips of your fingers...

250
00:25:09,820 --> 00:25:11,481
...and put it on the edge of your pIate.

251
00:25:11,555 --> 00:25:14,149
No fake middIe-cIass dellcacy.

252
00:25:14,324 --> 00:25:16,815
No hiding the bone behind a napkin.

253
00:25:17,761 --> 00:25:20,059
Today we'll start with the entree.

254
00:25:20,764 --> 00:25:22,061
Let's begin.

255
00:25:56,467 --> 00:25:57,456
Bone!

256
00:26:09,446 --> 00:26:11,038
May I be excused?

257
00:26:16,620 --> 00:26:17,985
You've done better.

258
00:26:18,055 --> 00:26:22,719
I know she's a pain, but I can bring her
around. She's got great potential.

259
00:26:22,893 --> 00:26:25,953
I llke her potential, too.
She has some mighty nice potential.

260
00:26:27,631 --> 00:26:30,065
So, bottom llne me about this girI.

261
00:26:30,467 --> 00:26:33,493
We need a young female operative.
I think she's the one.

262
00:26:33,570 --> 00:26:36,232
Usually, it takes two years. In this case--

263
00:26:36,306 --> 00:26:37,637
Six months.

264
00:26:38,142 --> 00:26:41,509
That's right. And I don't want to see
any more attitude from her.

265
00:26:41,578 --> 00:26:45,742
Enough with this crap. She bites,
she kicks, she throws food...what is that?

266
00:26:46,450 --> 00:26:47,917
So, you got it?

267
00:26:48,085 --> 00:26:52,749
Six months. And I want immediate resuIts
or she gets a bullet in the brain.

268
00:27:12,676 --> 00:27:13,802
Turn it off.

269
00:27:18,515 --> 00:27:20,210
Ask me why I'm so serious.

270
00:27:21,185 --> 00:27:22,652
Why are you so serious?

271
00:27:22,719 --> 00:27:26,450
Because I've got serious stuff to tell you,
Maggie for Margaret.

272
00:27:28,625 --> 00:27:30,286
First, the good stuff.

273
00:27:52,983 --> 00:27:54,416
Happy birthday.

274
00:27:56,920 --> 00:27:59,047
Okay, now the bad stuff.

275
00:27:59,656 --> 00:28:02,056
Kaufman has drawn a llne in the sand.

276
00:28:02,226 --> 00:28:05,320
He says he's not gonna take
any more crap from you.

277
00:28:05,429 --> 00:28:08,330
He mentioned the word ''bullet''
and the word ''brain.''

278
00:28:08,565 --> 00:28:11,557
You hearing me? Is this going in, Maggie?

279
00:28:11,735 --> 00:28:14,670
Because I want you to know,
it's now out of my hands.

280
00:28:30,921 --> 00:28:32,183
Happy birthday.

281
00:29:00,117 --> 00:29:01,482
WllI you heIp me?

282
00:29:02,986 --> 00:29:04,886
Of course. Come upstairs.

283
00:29:05,622 --> 00:29:09,422
All you need is balance.
We have to find your feminine strength.

284
00:29:10,727 --> 00:29:12,888
Some moon to go with your sun.

285
00:29:13,730 --> 00:29:16,290
A bit of the poet to balance the warrior.

286
00:29:40,157 --> 00:29:42,352
Don't you want to carry your jacket?

287
00:29:42,426 --> 00:29:44,326
SureIy not just for a dinner Iesson.

288
00:29:44,428 --> 00:29:45,759
What's worth doing...

289
00:29:45,829 --> 00:29:49,094
-...is worth doing well.
-You've mentioned that before.

290
00:29:49,166 --> 00:29:51,862
Et tu as pris longtemps pour l'apprendre,
ma chere.

291
00:29:51,935 --> 00:29:54,961
J'ai pense me le faire tatouer sur le bras.

292
00:29:55,038 --> 00:29:56,528
Very good!

293
00:29:59,109 --> 00:30:00,337
You Iook...

294
00:30:00,610 --> 00:30:01,941
...beautifuI.

295
00:30:04,448 --> 00:30:07,349
You've really outdone yourseIf this time.

296
00:30:07,951 --> 00:30:10,283
Yes, about this one, I am pIeased.

297
00:30:10,487 --> 00:30:13,650
Then why do I have to have
another dinner Iesson after six months?

298
00:30:13,724 --> 00:30:18,127
Or are you afraid I'll revert
and put my feet back up on the tabIe?

299
00:30:18,628 --> 00:30:19,959
I think that...

300
00:30:20,364 --> 00:30:22,798
...tonight we shouId have dinner out.

301
00:30:26,169 --> 00:30:27,227
Really?

302
00:30:28,972 --> 00:30:30,872
Oh, thank you!

303
00:30:32,642 --> 00:30:34,075
Shall we go?

304
00:32:06,269 --> 00:32:08,897
Good evening. WouId you llke
to see the wine llst?

305
00:32:09,306 --> 00:32:12,298
No, thanks.
Just a bottIe of Dom Perignon, pIease.

306
00:32:12,375 --> 00:32:13,672
Very good, sir.

307
00:32:16,346 --> 00:32:17,404
Thank you.

308
00:32:35,599 --> 00:32:37,760
Don't open it yet.

309
00:32:38,768 --> 00:32:40,201
That's fine.

310
00:33:00,156 --> 00:33:02,454
More than you can possibIy imagine...

311
00:33:03,226 --> 00:33:05,194
...I wish you every good thing.

312
00:33:22,012 --> 00:33:23,206
It's Ioaded.

313
00:33:25,215 --> 00:33:26,182
I don't understand.

314
00:33:26,249 --> 00:33:29,480
A Iady and two men
are sitting behind you on the balcony.

315
00:33:30,687 --> 00:33:32,655
The man on the right is a VIP.

316
00:33:33,056 --> 00:33:35,024
The other one's his bodyguard.

317
00:33:35,725 --> 00:33:39,252
I want you to put two bullets in the VIP...
two bullets minimum.

318
00:33:40,063 --> 00:33:41,826
Then go to the men's room.

319
00:33:41,965 --> 00:33:45,731
In the Iast stall there's a small window
that Ieads to a courtyard.

320
00:33:45,802 --> 00:33:48,066
There wllI be a car waiting for you.

321
00:33:50,674 --> 00:33:52,665
Don't do anything tllI I Ieave.

322
00:33:53,043 --> 00:33:55,238
You've got three minutes, okay?

323
00:38:16,506 --> 00:38:18,440
It was bricked in.

324
00:38:19,309 --> 00:38:21,174
The window was all bricked in.

325
00:38:21,244 --> 00:38:23,178
Yes, of course it was.

326
00:38:24,080 --> 00:38:25,775
That was your final test.

327
00:38:27,851 --> 00:38:29,443
Motherfucker!

328
00:38:33,690 --> 00:38:35,783
-Stop it! Stop it!
-Son of a bitch!

329
00:38:35,859 --> 00:38:37,690
You get out tomorrow!

330
00:38:39,429 --> 00:38:41,294
You get out tomorrow.

331
00:38:42,999 --> 00:38:46,093
It was your Iast test.
You get out tomorrow.

332
00:39:08,625 --> 00:39:10,559
I'm really gonna miss you.

333
00:39:11,928 --> 00:39:13,156
You know that.

334
00:39:25,375 --> 00:39:27,343
I'll never kiss you again.

335
00:39:57,407 --> 00:39:59,875
What IeveI of operation is she ready for?

336
00:40:00,576 --> 00:40:01,543
S-1 .

337
00:40:01,978 --> 00:40:03,343
Ambitious as ever.

338
00:40:05,982 --> 00:40:07,244
Don't sit down.

339
00:40:08,985 --> 00:40:10,714
I need her ready by March.

340
00:40:13,022 --> 00:40:14,649
You're gonna Iove this.

341
00:40:14,791 --> 00:40:17,089
A woman goes into a bar
with a duck under her arm.

342
00:40:17,160 --> 00:40:20,891
Orders a few beers. Bartender says,
''What're you doing with that pig?''

343
00:40:20,964 --> 00:40:24,957
She says, ''This is a duck.''
He said, ''I was talking to the duck.''

344
00:40:26,536 --> 00:40:28,231
I was talking to the duck!

345
00:40:30,373 --> 00:40:32,068
I think you're dangerous.

346
00:40:33,176 --> 00:40:37,806
A real Ioose cannon. If it was up to me
we'd put you down, so make no mistakes.

347
00:40:38,448 --> 00:40:42,646
I'm telling you, if you cross on a red llght,
you are worm bait.

348
00:40:43,553 --> 00:40:44,645
Entiende?

349
00:40:48,324 --> 00:40:49,313
Bye.

350
00:40:55,898 --> 00:40:57,627
I was talking to the duck.

351
00:40:58,368 --> 00:41:02,930
Your name is CIaudia Doran. You're from
Chicago. You llve in Venice, Callfornia.

352
00:41:03,106 --> 00:41:06,564
You're a computer expert for Super Mac.
You traveI a Iot.

353
00:41:07,443 --> 00:41:10,776
Here's your passport,
driver's llcense, birth certificate.

354
00:41:11,614 --> 00:41:14,344
There's cash in here
to buy yourseIf a new car.

355
00:41:15,585 --> 00:41:17,849
Your code name is Nina.

356
00:41:20,723 --> 00:41:22,623
As in Nina Simone?

357
00:41:26,696 --> 00:41:27,890
Yeah.

358
00:41:28,064 --> 00:41:29,463
I'm scared.

359
00:41:29,799 --> 00:41:30,857
You?

360
00:41:31,601 --> 00:41:33,228
That'll be the day.

361
00:41:38,074 --> 00:41:39,234
Go on.

362
00:43:31,387 --> 00:43:32,581
I warned you.

363
00:43:35,892 --> 00:43:37,587
It needs a Iot of work!

364
00:43:40,163 --> 00:43:41,994
That's not a urine stain.

365
00:43:43,332 --> 00:43:44,560
It's fully--

366
00:43:47,970 --> 00:43:51,269
Actually, there's another one
that's cIoser to being done.

367
00:44:11,394 --> 00:44:12,691
I'll take it.

368
00:44:18,034 --> 00:44:19,194
All right.

369
00:45:57,633 --> 00:45:58,861
Here's your...

370
00:45:59,201 --> 00:46:00,293
...ravioll.

371
00:46:01,971 --> 00:46:03,734
And your ravioll.

372
00:46:04,907 --> 00:46:06,135
And your...

373
00:46:06,442 --> 00:46:08,535
...oh, my goodness, it's ravioll.

374
00:46:09,145 --> 00:46:10,203
Thanks.

375
00:46:11,347 --> 00:46:14,976
Cammie Swiss Cake Rolls.
Now that sounds nutritious.

376
00:46:16,319 --> 00:46:20,813
Sorry. I suppose it's embarrassing to have
some fooI pawing through your food.

377
00:46:21,524 --> 00:46:23,890
Don't worry about it.
I don't get embarrassed.

378
00:46:24,694 --> 00:46:26,025
What do you mean?

379
00:46:26,696 --> 00:46:28,323
Just nothing embarrasses me.

380
00:46:28,397 --> 00:46:29,659
You mean, ever?

381
00:46:34,337 --> 00:46:37,238
That's great!
You'll have to teach me that trick.

382
00:46:41,010 --> 00:46:42,409
Where're you from?

383
00:46:45,848 --> 00:46:48,043
-It's not a trick question.
-Chicago.

384
00:46:48,117 --> 00:46:49,516
I'm from Denver.

385
00:46:50,519 --> 00:46:53,682
So I know you're from Chicago,
and you Iove ravioll.

386
00:46:54,423 --> 00:46:55,685
That's a start.

387
00:47:00,196 --> 00:47:02,687
So how does someone
get to know you better?

388
00:47:04,667 --> 00:47:06,328
For you, it'd be easy.

389
00:47:06,435 --> 00:47:08,494
Then have dinner with me tonight.

390
00:47:10,439 --> 00:47:11,929
Oh, okay.

391
00:47:12,141 --> 00:47:13,540
Let me guess....

392
00:47:14,276 --> 00:47:15,265
Ravioll?

393
00:47:16,779 --> 00:47:18,041
It's a deal.

394
00:47:19,014 --> 00:47:21,744
So all I have to do is
show any apartment that's vacant...

395
00:47:21,817 --> 00:47:24,752
...change llght buIbs,
sweep the stairs once a week...

396
00:47:24,820 --> 00:47:26,981
...pick up rent checks. For that...

397
00:47:27,656 --> 00:47:29,317
...half off my own rent.

398
00:47:29,458 --> 00:47:32,723
MostIy what I do, though,
is work on my portfollo.

399
00:47:33,229 --> 00:47:34,662
I'm a photographer.

400
00:47:35,598 --> 00:47:37,691
I take some good stuff sometimes.

401
00:47:37,767 --> 00:47:41,567
I've soId to some galleries.
Weston and Levinson's, you know?

402
00:47:42,505 --> 00:47:45,702
All day, though,
all I do is just run around...

403
00:47:46,509 --> 00:47:48,500
...and just take care of stuff.

404
00:47:58,687 --> 00:48:00,587
You really llke ravioll, huh?

405
00:48:34,623 --> 00:48:36,523
I usually make the first move.

406
00:48:38,561 --> 00:48:39,926
This is fine, too.

407
00:50:40,316 --> 00:50:41,510
This is hard.

408
00:50:41,750 --> 00:50:43,342
Shut up and finish it.

409
00:50:43,619 --> 00:50:46,520
-It's hard as hell.
-Shut up and finish it.

410
00:50:46,822 --> 00:50:48,380
Let's go out, get a hamburger--

411
00:50:48,457 --> 00:50:50,618
Shut up and finish it.

412
00:50:51,860 --> 00:50:54,852
I'll call Ned and Karen
and see if they want to come.

413
00:50:55,864 --> 00:50:56,922
Sure.

414
00:50:58,033 --> 00:51:00,763
Sure. You don't really llke them much,
do you?

415
00:51:02,204 --> 00:51:03,398
They're okay.

416
00:51:05,941 --> 00:51:09,069
Well, why don't you ask
somebody sometime?

417
00:51:09,178 --> 00:51:10,406
Like who?

418
00:51:10,512 --> 00:51:11,638
I don't know.

419
00:51:12,348 --> 00:51:16,284
A friend. One of your buddies.
Somebody you llke to hang around with.

420
00:51:16,585 --> 00:51:19,782
You haven't had one person
in this pIace in four months.

421
00:51:20,489 --> 00:51:21,717
I know.

422
00:51:21,924 --> 00:51:23,221
Not one.

423
00:51:25,427 --> 00:51:27,122
'Cause I want onIy you.

424
00:51:28,998 --> 00:51:30,363
You're so guarded.

425
00:51:30,432 --> 00:51:31,763
I'm not guarded.

426
00:51:31,834 --> 00:51:33,893
-Yes, you are.
-No, I'm not.

427
00:51:34,269 --> 00:51:36,737
You're llke llving with a ghost.

428
00:51:37,439 --> 00:51:39,339
You never tell me anything.

429
00:51:42,778 --> 00:51:44,575
All right. So, then...

430
00:51:45,781 --> 00:51:47,578
...what do you want to know?

431
00:51:49,685 --> 00:51:53,644
I don't know. I wanna know
what your fifth grade teacher was llke.

432
00:51:54,123 --> 00:51:57,752
I wanna know if this pretty face
had pimpIes on it in high schooI.

433
00:51:59,328 --> 00:52:01,592
I wanna meet your friends from work.

434
00:52:01,764 --> 00:52:05,427
I wanna know why you llsten to
Nina Simone when you're in a bad mood.

435
00:52:19,682 --> 00:52:20,910
Forget it.

436
00:52:46,542 --> 00:52:48,669
My mother Ioved Nina Simone.

437
00:52:51,714 --> 00:52:54,274
She used to pIay her records all the time.

438
00:52:59,188 --> 00:53:02,180
I grew up llstening to this music.

439
00:53:02,791 --> 00:53:03,780
It...

440
00:53:06,361 --> 00:53:07,851
...sounded so...

441
00:53:09,832 --> 00:53:11,231
...passionate...

442
00:53:12,067 --> 00:53:13,557
...so savage.

443
00:53:17,673 --> 00:53:19,868
All about Iove and Ioss.

444
00:53:25,147 --> 00:53:28,082
I pIay Nina Simone
when I think about my mother.

445
00:54:00,816 --> 00:54:02,249
-Hello?
-Nina?

446
00:54:07,055 --> 00:54:09,353
J.W. Marriott in Century City.

447
00:54:09,525 --> 00:54:12,119
Personnel entrance. One hour.

448
00:54:13,295 --> 00:54:14,421
All right.

449
00:54:15,731 --> 00:54:16,755
Bye.

450
00:54:18,433 --> 00:54:19,695
Who's that?

451
00:54:21,603 --> 00:54:24,697
I'm about to Iose a sale on 500 video cards.

452
00:54:25,307 --> 00:54:28,299
And I gotta go all the way to EI Segundo.

453
00:54:32,281 --> 00:54:33,373
Hurry back.

454
00:54:34,349 --> 00:54:35,475
I wllI.

455
00:55:03,645 --> 00:55:04,805
Excuse me.

456
00:55:06,982 --> 00:55:08,210
What do I do?

457
00:55:13,255 --> 00:55:14,415
Change.

458
00:55:33,308 --> 00:55:34,297
Now what?

459
00:55:35,210 --> 00:55:36,609
Now we wait.

460
00:55:37,479 --> 00:55:39,140
Testing, one...two...three.

461
00:55:41,617 --> 00:55:43,346
Testing, one...two...three.

462
00:56:09,945 --> 00:56:11,810
Good morning. Room service.

463
00:56:13,782 --> 00:56:17,878
CertainIy. About 15 minutes.
Yes, sir, thank you for calling.

464
00:56:38,874 --> 00:56:41,604
-What do I do?
-Take this tray where I tell you.

465
00:56:42,044 --> 00:56:43,375
-Then?
-Nothing.

466
00:56:43,445 --> 00:56:47,643
You take the tray up, give him the tray
and you come back down here.

467
00:56:48,083 --> 00:56:49,675
That too much for you?

468
00:57:43,739 --> 00:57:44,728
Thanks.

469
00:57:51,580 --> 00:57:53,070
Now what do I do?

470
00:57:53,982 --> 00:57:55,244
Go home.

471
00:57:55,684 --> 00:57:56,844
That's it?

472
00:59:03,718 --> 00:59:04,707
So?

473
00:59:05,353 --> 00:59:06,684
How are you?

474
00:59:07,522 --> 00:59:10,047
Just bIew up a hoteI.
How the hell do you think I am?

475
00:59:10,125 --> 00:59:14,061
Everybody at headquarters,
especially Kaufman, is very happy.

476
00:59:14,229 --> 00:59:16,493
I just thought you'd llke to know that.

477
00:59:16,565 --> 00:59:17,827
FabuIous.

478
00:59:19,101 --> 00:59:21,501
So, I hear you've met somebody.

479
00:59:25,107 --> 00:59:26,404
What's he llke?

480
00:59:28,110 --> 00:59:30,078
He's really great.

481
00:59:30,178 --> 00:59:32,544
And I never wouId have met him
if it weren't for you.

482
00:59:32,614 --> 00:59:34,047
I have to meet him.

483
00:59:34,182 --> 00:59:35,171
What?

484
00:59:35,250 --> 00:59:38,242
Yeah. It's just a routine checkup.

485
00:59:41,323 --> 00:59:44,952
-I can't.
-Just invite me to dinner, okay?

486
00:59:46,161 --> 00:59:47,321
No.

487
00:59:49,030 --> 00:59:50,554
Just invite me to dinner.

488
00:59:55,670 --> 00:59:56,864
UncIe Bob!

489
00:59:57,405 --> 00:59:58,872
You must be J.P.

490
00:59:59,207 --> 01:00:00,697
You shouIdn't.

491
01:00:02,444 --> 01:00:03,775
You shouId've.

492
01:00:03,845 --> 01:00:04,937
Come on.

493
01:00:07,149 --> 01:00:11,552
It's such a pIeasure to meet you.
I haven't met any of her famlly.

494
01:00:12,587 --> 01:00:13,713
CIaudia.

495
01:00:16,491 --> 01:00:18,482
Long time no see.

496
01:00:18,627 --> 01:00:20,060
UncIe Bob.

497
01:00:21,796 --> 01:00:22,888
You Iook...

498
01:00:23,031 --> 01:00:25,158
...great! Really great!

499
01:00:25,634 --> 01:00:26,658
Thanks.

500
01:00:29,070 --> 01:00:31,334
-Can we get you--
-Something to drink?

501
01:00:32,774 --> 01:00:34,799
Scotch. Scotch wouId be nice.

502
01:00:35,977 --> 01:00:38,241
Oh, here. These are from UncIe Bob.

503
01:00:38,480 --> 01:00:39,708
Oh, great!

504
01:00:40,749 --> 01:00:42,740
She Iooks really beautifuI.

505
01:00:43,318 --> 01:00:45,343
Must be something to do with you.

506
01:00:45,420 --> 01:00:46,512
It is.

507
01:00:49,191 --> 01:00:51,819
You know, you're oIder than I thought.

508
01:00:53,628 --> 01:00:56,654
I bet you're not
the youngest photographer in town.

509
01:00:57,966 --> 01:00:59,331
That's true.

510
01:00:59,834 --> 01:01:03,270
But most other guys are just out
of high schooI. They have no experience.

511
01:01:03,338 --> 01:01:06,933
He may not be the youngest,
but he's certainIy the cutest.

512
01:01:10,812 --> 01:01:11,938
So....

513
01:01:13,181 --> 01:01:15,115
How oId are you, UncIe Bob?

514
01:01:15,584 --> 01:01:16,642
I'm...

515
01:01:17,819 --> 01:01:18,945
...37.

516
01:01:20,589 --> 01:01:22,454
So that makes you....

517
01:01:22,857 --> 01:01:23,881
Thirteen years oIder.

518
01:01:23,959 --> 01:01:27,588
It was funny. The other day
I was reading something, it was really--

519
01:01:27,662 --> 01:01:30,631
It's actually cIoser to 14.
Her birthday's in three months.

520
01:01:31,266 --> 01:01:33,632
What exactIy is your point, P.J.?

521
01:01:33,702 --> 01:01:34,794
J.P.

522
01:01:34,936 --> 01:01:36,130
You guys!

523
01:01:36,271 --> 01:01:37,568
Wait a minute.

524
01:01:37,839 --> 01:01:42,139
Easy. Why don't you just arm wrestIe
right now and get it over with?

525
01:01:49,651 --> 01:01:51,448
What was she llke as a chlld?

526
01:01:51,519 --> 01:01:55,649
I ask her all the time. She never talks
about herseIf. No detalls, nothing.

527
01:01:55,790 --> 01:01:57,724
-Let me see.
-What?

528
01:01:59,995 --> 01:02:04,159
He just wanted to know what
you were llke when you were a llttIe girI.

529
01:02:05,066 --> 01:02:06,590
You promised.

530
01:02:07,802 --> 01:02:10,771
-She hates questions.
-Do I ask you questions?

531
01:02:10,972 --> 01:02:12,769
No, I wish you wouId, though.

532
01:02:12,841 --> 01:02:15,503
-Can't we just drop it?
-Not this time.

533
01:02:15,610 --> 01:02:19,171
Don't you fucking get it?
I don't want to talk about it!

534
01:02:19,614 --> 01:02:23,914
I didn't drag my ass from the gutter
in Kansas City to take shit from you!

535
01:02:50,145 --> 01:02:52,136
I thought you were from Chicago.

536
01:02:54,883 --> 01:02:56,373
Kansas City.

537
01:02:56,885 --> 01:03:00,446
She was born in Kansas City
but raised in Chicago.

538
01:03:01,756 --> 01:03:05,157
I used to see her during the summers
on my uncIe's farm.

539
01:03:07,529 --> 01:03:10,555
You didn't know
she spent summers on a farm, did you?

540
01:03:12,167 --> 01:03:13,634
Well, she did.

541
01:03:15,036 --> 01:03:16,799
I remember one summer...

542
01:03:17,572 --> 01:03:19,096
...the Iocal kids...

543
01:03:20,408 --> 01:03:23,172
...the kids' famlly owned this mare.

544
01:03:23,478 --> 01:03:24,672
She was...

545
01:03:24,913 --> 01:03:29,282
...bIack as a raven's wing, compIeteIy wlld.
Remember? They called her Beauty.

546
01:03:30,985 --> 01:03:34,682
She was trained as a trotter,
but she had never really been ridden.

547
01:03:34,756 --> 01:03:35,916
Anyway....

548
01:03:36,057 --> 01:03:39,754
The kids toId CIaudia
that she had to ride Beauty...

549
01:03:40,562 --> 01:03:44,521
...that it was llke an initiation,
the kind of thing they all had to do.

550
01:03:45,233 --> 01:03:47,167
Anyway, one day, I remember...

551
01:03:47,502 --> 01:03:48,833
...about noon...

552
01:03:49,471 --> 01:03:51,371
...it was really, really hot.

553
01:03:52,040 --> 01:03:53,598
We heard this scream.

554
01:03:54,676 --> 01:03:56,337
We ran outside.

555
01:03:57,545 --> 01:03:58,910
There was CIaudia.

556
01:04:00,014 --> 01:04:01,106
CIaudia...

557
01:04:01,750 --> 01:04:03,945
...bareback on this wlld horse.

558
01:04:05,286 --> 01:04:08,221
The horse went compIeteIy crazy.
Bucked, reared.

559
01:04:09,357 --> 01:04:10,722
She hung on.

560
01:04:11,393 --> 01:04:14,294
She just gritted her teeth,
dug her heeIs in...

561
01:04:15,497 --> 01:04:16,930
...and she hung on.

562
01:04:18,533 --> 01:04:20,865
And, by God, she rode that horse.

563
01:04:24,305 --> 01:04:26,773
I guess that's how I remember her really.

564
01:04:27,842 --> 01:04:30,367
This sllp of a girI on a wlld bIack horse.

565
01:04:34,416 --> 01:04:36,145
She was so beautifuI.

566
01:04:38,520 --> 01:04:40,818
She was so beautifuI that she gIeamed.

567
01:04:47,962 --> 01:04:49,657
Do you know what I mean?

568
01:04:50,799 --> 01:04:52,198
That's really you.

569
01:04:56,404 --> 01:04:58,634
That's what I thought you'd be llke.

570
01:05:02,477 --> 01:05:03,774
By the way...

571
01:05:04,245 --> 01:05:06,577
...did CIaudia tell you what I do?

572
01:05:11,352 --> 01:05:12,944
I'm in the traveI business.

573
01:05:13,021 --> 01:05:15,854
I'm a partner in a traveI agency and...

574
01:05:18,993 --> 01:05:22,520
...I've got these two tickets here,
if you'd llke to take them.

575
01:05:23,097 --> 01:05:25,691
They're for New OrIeans
for the Mardi Gras.

576
01:05:26,034 --> 01:05:27,592
Thought you might llke to go.

577
01:05:31,506 --> 01:05:32,871
You're so sweet.

578
01:05:34,943 --> 01:05:37,537
I'll enjoy thinking of both of you there.

579
01:05:38,346 --> 01:05:39,278
I wllI.

580
01:06:33,268 --> 01:06:35,930
-I'm hungry!
-We gotta get out of here!

581
01:06:37,772 --> 01:06:39,262
We gotta go!

582
01:06:46,080 --> 01:06:47,638
Let's go to the hoteI!

583
01:06:47,982 --> 01:06:50,678
Wait! Let's try here!

584
01:06:51,819 --> 01:06:53,286
Through here!

585
01:06:55,089 --> 01:06:56,681
Can't we just eat here?

586
01:06:56,891 --> 01:07:00,122
Food's crappy.
I know that pIace is very cIose.

587
01:07:00,295 --> 01:07:01,785
You better be right.

588
01:07:09,070 --> 01:07:10,594
It's right over here.

589
01:07:20,715 --> 01:07:22,478
What do you want?

590
01:07:25,286 --> 01:07:26,583
We want your money.

591
01:07:26,654 --> 01:07:29,589
Maybe you couId heIp us out
with something to eat.

592
01:07:30,058 --> 01:07:32,322
Me and my friend, we real hungry now.

593
01:07:32,594 --> 01:07:35,154
Real good. We want all your money.

594
01:07:36,998 --> 01:07:38,158
Go to hell.

595
01:07:46,441 --> 01:07:47,430
Come on!

596
01:07:47,508 --> 01:07:50,375
-Wlld! What was that?
-I don't know.

597
01:07:50,778 --> 01:07:53,941
You beat the hell out of them.
You didn't even give me a chance.

598
01:07:54,015 --> 01:07:55,277
It was just a refIex.

599
01:07:55,350 --> 01:07:58,683
You've got some refIexes!
Where'd you Iearn how to do that?

600
01:08:03,925 --> 01:08:06,189
I don't know. I guess....

601
01:08:06,628 --> 01:08:10,792
I took a seIf-defense cIass once
when I was just a girI.

602
01:08:19,674 --> 01:08:21,608
I'm so hungry!

603
01:08:24,946 --> 01:08:26,675
I gotta have food.

604
01:08:28,683 --> 01:08:30,981
What is it? It's five, right?

605
01:08:32,920 --> 01:08:35,388
-Room service. May I help you?
-Hello?

606
01:08:39,060 --> 01:08:41,051
This is Room 30.

607
01:08:43,698 --> 01:08:46,292
I'd llke to order some food, pIease.

608
01:08:48,736 --> 01:08:51,261
CouId I have a coupIe of chicken salads...

609
01:08:51,372 --> 01:08:54,569
...and a coupIe of pieces of pecan pie...

610
01:08:54,909 --> 01:08:58,106
...and what kind of soda do you have?

611
01:09:01,315 --> 01:09:03,715
All right, then. I guess I'll have....

612
01:09:06,821 --> 01:09:08,448
I'll take Pepsi.

613
01:09:08,523 --> 01:09:13,256
Can I have four cans of that,
because we get thirsty after sex?

614
01:09:22,203 --> 01:09:23,636
Kiss my neck.

615
01:09:23,871 --> 01:09:24,895
Okay.

616
01:09:27,308 --> 01:09:28,707
Kiss it harder.

617
01:09:37,452 --> 01:09:38,476
Yes?

618
01:09:38,686 --> 01:09:39,675
Nina?

619
01:09:43,357 --> 01:09:44,221
Yes?

620
01:09:44,592 --> 01:09:47,322
The bathroom cabinet has
a hidden compartment.

621
01:09:51,866 --> 01:09:52,992
All right.

622
01:09:53,768 --> 01:09:56,760
Then make it two pieces
of chocoIate rum cake.

623
01:10:02,009 --> 01:10:03,442
They're all out of pecan pie.

624
01:10:03,511 --> 01:10:05,445
Okay, we're out of this joint.

625
01:10:08,916 --> 01:10:11,441
I gotta take a bath. I feeI really dirty.

626
01:10:12,220 --> 01:10:15,189
If you couId just wait
for room service, pIease.

627
01:10:45,620 --> 01:10:46,917
Nina in position.

628
01:10:46,988 --> 01:10:48,819
First item's under the sink.

629
01:11:18,653 --> 01:11:20,917
-AssembIy compIeted.
-Open the window.

630
01:11:30,998 --> 01:11:33,193
-There's no handIe.
-Open the window.

631
01:11:35,903 --> 01:11:37,928
-CIaudia?
-Yeah?

632
01:11:39,140 --> 01:11:41,267
You know what I've been thinking?

633
01:11:43,344 --> 01:11:44,436
What?

634
01:11:45,213 --> 01:11:47,044
I've got a really good idea.

635
01:11:49,750 --> 01:11:53,277
Just thinking we couId make Bob's present
an engagement present.

636
01:11:54,288 --> 01:11:56,188
Save the poor sIob some money.

637
01:12:07,535 --> 01:12:08,866
Okay.

638
01:12:10,605 --> 01:12:13,073
What do you say, you wanna do it?
Make it formal?

639
01:12:14,976 --> 01:12:16,000
Honey?

640
01:12:20,281 --> 01:12:21,646
The limousine.

641
01:12:25,019 --> 01:12:26,748
Take aim on the limousine.

642
01:12:28,155 --> 01:12:30,487
We're waiting for further instructions.

643
01:12:34,762 --> 01:12:37,595
I asked you a question.
Don't I deserve an answer?

644
01:12:37,665 --> 01:12:38,893
In a minute.

645
01:12:40,368 --> 01:12:43,531
It's how I always imagined it.
Proposing through a door.

646
01:12:49,510 --> 01:12:51,444
Christ! What is it with you?

647
01:12:55,950 --> 01:12:57,474
Say something.

648
01:12:57,685 --> 01:13:00,347
Say, ''Go to hell, J.P.''
Tell me you Iove me...

649
01:13:00,821 --> 01:13:03,949
...or ''Get Iost'' or whatever.
Just answer me, okay?

650
01:13:09,497 --> 01:13:10,828
Room service.

651
01:13:16,370 --> 01:13:18,031
-How many targets?
-One.

652
01:13:18,873 --> 01:13:21,808
-What's he Iook llke?
-I haven't been informed yet.

653
01:13:24,512 --> 01:13:27,072
How're you enjoying
our beautifuI Mardi Gras?

654
01:13:27,148 --> 01:13:28,137
Real well.

655
01:13:28,215 --> 01:13:30,206
Target visible in five seconds.

656
01:13:42,229 --> 01:13:44,993
-Thanks.
-Y'all come back and see us, you hear?

657
01:13:46,667 --> 01:13:47,998
Which one is it?

658
01:13:48,169 --> 01:13:49,932
I don't have that data yet.

659
01:13:50,538 --> 01:13:52,563
You've got nothing to say to me?

660
01:13:52,873 --> 01:13:54,363
Which target, dammit?

661
01:13:55,176 --> 01:13:56,404
The woman.

662
01:14:02,950 --> 01:14:04,383
The woman in white.

663
01:14:10,758 --> 01:14:12,521
The woman in white, I said.

664
01:14:21,769 --> 01:14:23,202
The fucking woman!

665
01:14:35,216 --> 01:14:36,547
What is with you?

666
01:14:38,452 --> 01:14:40,147
What the hell's going on?

667
01:14:43,457 --> 01:14:44,583
What's this?

668
01:14:49,663 --> 01:14:51,688
You've got nothing to say to me?

669
01:14:53,801 --> 01:14:56,634
A whlle ago, I did something really bad.

670
01:14:59,807 --> 01:15:03,868
I came through it,
but I'm always gonna be paying for it.

671
01:15:07,214 --> 01:15:08,408
It's okay.

672
01:15:13,954 --> 01:15:15,615
It's in the past.

673
01:15:15,890 --> 01:15:17,482
You can just Iet it go.

674
01:15:18,492 --> 01:15:19,823
I can't.

675
01:15:23,197 --> 01:15:25,097
But you've got to belleve me.

676
01:15:27,301 --> 01:15:28,996
If I'm secretive...

677
01:15:29,937 --> 01:15:31,996
...I've got my reasons.

678
01:15:34,842 --> 01:15:36,503
For now, I'll take that.

679
01:15:39,847 --> 01:15:41,007
But for now.

680
01:16:20,054 --> 01:16:23,319
Students, this is a defensive tactic.
Watch me.

681
01:16:26,327 --> 01:16:27,919
So how was New OrIeans?

682
01:16:30,498 --> 01:16:32,728
Everything you touch turns to shit.

683
01:16:36,504 --> 01:16:40,964
Why'd you send me on a job with J.P.?
What happens to him if he finds out?

684
01:16:41,208 --> 01:16:43,438
I know it wasn't an easy job.

685
01:16:43,611 --> 01:16:45,772
You're so pathetic. Listen to you.

686
01:16:45,846 --> 01:16:49,247
You stand there with that llttIe smlle.
Drop the fucking mask, for once.

687
01:16:49,817 --> 01:16:51,808
Fuck you! That was my Iast job.

688
01:16:53,754 --> 01:16:55,949
You stupid, ignorant llttIe girI.

689
01:16:56,123 --> 01:16:58,990
You think you can decide
you don't want to pIay anymore?

690
01:16:59,059 --> 01:17:01,357
Where the fuck do you think you are?

691
01:17:01,529 --> 01:17:04,054
Haven't you heard anything that I've said?

692
01:17:04,131 --> 01:17:05,689
-I mean it!
-You don't know what you're saying.

693
01:17:05,766 --> 01:17:09,759
-I'm through! I'm out!
-Which word do you not understand?

694
01:17:10,204 --> 01:17:13,605
There is no out. There is no through.
There is no out!

695
01:17:22,917 --> 01:17:24,407
You've gotta heIp me.

696
01:17:25,152 --> 01:17:27,950
I can't do this.
I can't llve llke this anymore.

697
01:17:32,293 --> 01:17:34,727
Don't you llke me well enough to heIp me?

698
01:17:35,429 --> 01:17:36,691
Like you?

699
01:17:38,832 --> 01:17:39,924
I know...

700
01:17:40,401 --> 01:17:43,461
...you llke that you made me
into something different.

701
01:17:45,072 --> 01:17:47,438
But you're not Iooking cIose enough.

702
01:17:47,841 --> 01:17:49,240
I am different.

703
01:17:50,611 --> 01:17:52,238
HeIp me be better.

704
01:17:54,548 --> 01:17:56,982
PIease, Bob, Iet me go.

705
01:18:13,534 --> 01:18:15,434
You know who Fahd Bahktiar is?

706
01:18:18,606 --> 01:18:20,369
He's one of the worId's richest men.

707
01:18:20,441 --> 01:18:23,410
He's peddllng nucIear information
to the MiddIe East.

708
01:18:23,811 --> 01:18:27,838
I need a woman for this one.
It's the kind of job you were trained for.

709
01:18:29,683 --> 01:18:31,617
I want you to do three things.

710
01:18:31,952 --> 01:18:35,388
Number one: Impersonate his girIfriend
so you can get into his house.

711
01:18:35,456 --> 01:18:39,859
Two: Take the disk that he's been sending
the data on, then destroy his computer.

712
01:18:40,628 --> 01:18:42,027
And number three:

713
01:18:42,896 --> 01:18:44,693
I want you to take him out.

714
01:18:49,136 --> 01:18:52,162
If I do this job, if I bring this off...

715
01:18:52,473 --> 01:18:55,135
...wllI you do what you can
to heIp me get out?

716
01:19:00,948 --> 01:19:02,006
No.

717
01:19:19,800 --> 01:19:21,427
Thank you, Iadies and gentIemen.

718
01:19:21,502 --> 01:19:24,232
WouId you take these, John? Thanks.

719
01:19:28,842 --> 01:19:30,935
Maggie! What a pIeasure!

720
01:19:32,079 --> 01:19:33,546
How are you?

721
01:19:35,749 --> 01:19:37,478
Does anybody ever get out?

722
01:19:38,819 --> 01:19:40,980
Thank you, John. I'll do the rest.

723
01:19:43,524 --> 01:19:47,085
Were you llke me once?
WouId they Iet you Ieave if you wanted to?

724
01:19:49,496 --> 01:19:53,762
Happiness in llfe comes from braiding
together what one wouId llke to have...

725
01:19:54,335 --> 01:19:55,461
...with what is inevitabIe.

726
01:19:55,536 --> 01:19:58,596
Stop that shit!
Stop talking llke that and answer me!

727
01:20:02,543 --> 01:20:03,601
I'm sorry.

728
01:20:05,112 --> 01:20:09,071
I don't want to be rude to you. You were
the onIy one who was nice to me here.

729
01:20:13,253 --> 01:20:14,948
PIease, couId you tell me?

730
01:20:17,024 --> 01:20:19,458
CouId you just Ieave if you wanted to?

731
01:20:19,993 --> 01:20:22,120
Just get on a pIane and disappear?

732
01:20:24,732 --> 01:20:26,393
To tell the truth, dear...

733
01:20:26,467 --> 01:20:30,494
...I don't know. It's a possibllity
that never entered my mind.

734
01:20:40,114 --> 01:20:41,843
You won't tell Bob I came?

735
01:20:43,550 --> 01:20:44,608
Thank you.

736
01:21:03,604 --> 01:21:05,435
-You Iook tired.
-I am.

737
01:21:05,773 --> 01:21:07,798
-Want a back rub?
-Yeah.

738
01:21:07,908 --> 01:21:10,069
-With the hypnotic fantasy oll?
-Yeah.

739
01:21:10,144 --> 01:21:11,270
All right.

740
01:21:11,712 --> 01:21:13,009
On the bed.

741
01:21:13,080 --> 01:21:14,513
I'll be right back.

742
01:21:20,654 --> 01:21:21,882
Hello, Maggie.

743
01:21:23,924 --> 01:21:26,358
These are copies of the photos
I gave you.

744
01:21:26,827 --> 01:21:28,761
Amanda says that you...

745
01:21:29,863 --> 01:21:31,194
...dropped them.

746
01:21:32,733 --> 01:21:34,530
I don't think I can do it.

747
01:21:41,742 --> 01:21:43,972
If you pull this job off for me...

748
01:21:45,512 --> 01:21:47,810
...I'll see what I can do to heIp you.

749
01:21:55,622 --> 01:21:57,283
See the upstairs corner?

750
01:21:57,558 --> 01:22:01,494
That's his bedroom. Right here.
You arrive earIy. You do it here.

751
01:22:02,095 --> 01:22:04,996
With the right wig, cIothes,
attitude, you can...

752
01:22:05,132 --> 01:22:08,158
...Iook sufficientIy llke the girIfriend
to get in his house.

753
01:22:08,235 --> 01:22:10,362
What happens to her? Does she die, too?

754
01:22:10,537 --> 01:22:13,165
AbsoIuteIy not.
No unnecessary wetworks.

755
01:22:14,241 --> 01:22:15,367
Good.

756
01:22:16,910 --> 01:22:21,040
Look at those earrings.
Get the buck in the walk. It's that thing.

757
01:22:21,181 --> 01:22:22,705
I have those gIasses.

758
01:22:22,816 --> 01:22:25,751
-Yeah? Great.
-I'll get that brand of cigarettes.

759
01:22:25,853 --> 01:22:27,844
-She's right-handed.
-Me, too.

760
01:22:27,955 --> 01:22:29,354
Long cigarettes.

761
01:22:30,157 --> 01:22:31,556
Is that moIe real?

762
01:22:31,658 --> 01:22:32,886
Not on me, it won't be.

763
01:22:32,960 --> 01:22:34,291
Here we go again.

764
01:22:37,798 --> 01:22:39,925
''Happy birthday to you''

765
01:22:46,573 --> 01:22:48,200
They don't go out!

766
01:22:48,375 --> 01:22:50,002
It won't go out.

767
01:22:53,380 --> 01:22:55,041
It's heavy.

768
01:22:55,215 --> 01:22:57,206
It's heavy.

769
01:22:59,653 --> 01:23:01,450
Get out of the way now.

770
01:23:01,889 --> 01:23:04,050
Get out of the way now.

771
01:23:06,627 --> 01:23:07,855
There he is.

772
01:23:10,297 --> 01:23:14,233
Frank, for Christ's sake,
do us a favor and put the camera away.

773
01:23:14,368 --> 01:23:15,426
All right.

774
01:23:16,203 --> 01:23:17,795
Let's go over it again.

775
01:23:18,305 --> 01:23:20,273
We've onIy done it 20 times.

776
01:23:20,374 --> 01:23:23,309
Look, it's tomorrow night.
This is our Iast chance.

777
01:23:23,510 --> 01:23:26,638
Okay. We meet at four o'cIock
to go to Angela's.

778
01:23:27,514 --> 01:23:29,311
Let's make it a quarter to.

779
01:23:29,416 --> 01:23:31,145
That'll give us more time.

780
01:23:31,752 --> 01:23:33,083
Hey, honey!

781
01:23:36,990 --> 01:23:39,925
UncIe Bob, is it really you?
How nice to see you.

782
01:23:40,327 --> 01:23:42,989
No, it can't be UncIe Bob. It's got to be...

783
01:23:43,530 --> 01:23:45,657
...Aunt Paullne or Cousin Molly...

784
01:23:45,766 --> 01:23:47,358
...or something, right?

785
01:23:48,802 --> 01:23:50,667
Wait a minute! I got it!

786
01:23:51,638 --> 01:23:55,665
This must be Cindy D'Amato. Used to
work for Super Mac. Quit to get married.

787
01:23:57,010 --> 01:23:59,137
Hi. How the hell are you?

788
01:24:07,821 --> 01:24:10,289
What in heaven's name
have you got there?

789
01:24:10,357 --> 01:24:13,952
You bought it for me, remember?
When I moved into the studio.

790
01:24:14,661 --> 01:24:18,324
-Give me that nonsensical object. Give it--
-You keep away from me.

791
01:24:18,532 --> 01:24:20,625
Don't you try to intimidate me.

792
01:24:21,568 --> 01:24:23,365
You are not going to tell Carol.

793
01:24:23,437 --> 01:24:24,529
Swear you won't!

794
01:24:24,605 --> 01:24:26,368
I'll swear to nothing!

795
01:24:53,400 --> 01:24:54,867
-Hi.
-Hi.

796
01:25:06,413 --> 01:25:07,880
We're from Sherry's.

797
01:25:08,148 --> 01:25:09,581
Where's Francine?

798
01:25:09,650 --> 01:25:12,084
Francine's sick today, so Sherry sent us.

799
01:25:12,819 --> 01:25:14,150
They said Francine was coming.

800
01:25:14,221 --> 01:25:17,748
I guess they got it wrong
'cause Francine's sick. I don't know.

801
01:25:17,858 --> 01:25:20,850
Sherry sent us
'cause Francine ate something bad.

802
01:25:22,229 --> 01:25:23,719
She got sick.

803
01:25:24,297 --> 01:25:27,664
I couId really care Iess
if I did another head of hair today.

804
01:25:27,834 --> 01:25:29,426
So make up your mind.

805
01:25:35,909 --> 01:25:37,376
All right. Come on.

806
01:25:43,984 --> 01:25:46,248
Who are these peopIe? Where's Francine?

807
01:25:46,319 --> 01:25:47,843
Francine's sick, so we're here.

808
01:25:47,921 --> 01:25:51,288
Great. Some new fucking bIood.
Can you do me out here?

809
01:25:51,425 --> 01:25:53,757
Sure. I can burn hair anywhere.

810
01:25:53,894 --> 01:25:55,191
Is this outfit all right?

811
01:25:55,262 --> 01:25:56,889
-Is the stain gone?
-Yes.

812
01:25:56,963 --> 01:25:59,557
Fine. Put it in my room
with the red boots.

813
01:26:01,268 --> 01:26:03,793
I want some fucking softness
around my face.

814
01:26:04,438 --> 01:26:07,100
Last time Francine did me,
she sllcked all my hair back...

815
01:26:07,174 --> 01:26:10,143
...and made me Iook llke
some kind of fucking dyke.

816
01:26:11,011 --> 01:26:12,945
Did you guys meet my friends?

817
01:26:13,613 --> 01:26:16,980
This is ''Stupid''
and the other one is ''Stupider.''

818
01:26:20,887 --> 01:26:24,186
-WouId you llke some ginseng tea?
-No, I don't drink tea.

819
01:26:25,992 --> 01:26:29,985
Francine says you Iove her ginseng tea.
It's great for the sex drive.

820
01:26:30,063 --> 01:26:32,657
Well, I've got no troubIe
in that department.

821
01:26:32,733 --> 01:26:34,132
It's really very good.

822
01:26:34,201 --> 01:26:36,999
Enough with the fucking tea,
for Christ's sake.

823
01:26:38,405 --> 01:26:39,770
Suit yourseIf.

824
01:26:41,074 --> 01:26:43,838
-Do you have sllk, pIease, for my fingers?
-Sure.

825
01:27:07,134 --> 01:27:09,227
Oh, God! I'm dead!

826
01:27:09,970 --> 01:27:12,165
-Let me see.
-Damn it, I'm hit!

827
01:27:12,606 --> 01:27:13,800
It's okay.

828
01:27:15,976 --> 01:27:18,035
HoId stllI. Just push it hard.

829
01:27:18,345 --> 01:27:19,539
I'm calling Kaufman.

830
01:27:19,613 --> 01:27:22,138
-I'm calling Kaufman.
-I can finish it. I have to!

831
01:27:22,215 --> 01:27:25,480
He said if anything goes wrong,
we're supposed to call him.

832
01:27:28,321 --> 01:27:31,381
It's screwed up.
There are two down and I'm hit.

833
01:27:32,192 --> 01:27:33,250
How?

834
01:27:34,528 --> 01:27:36,723
Okay, okay. Yes, okay.

835
01:27:39,466 --> 01:27:41,331
They're calling in a cIeaner.

836
01:27:41,535 --> 01:27:42,695
Oh, Jesus!

837
01:28:01,588 --> 01:28:04,318
We've heard reports of shots.
Did you hear anything?

838
01:28:11,097 --> 01:28:12,997
I'm Victor. I'm the cIeaner.

839
01:28:21,274 --> 01:28:25,005
The job's gone bad,
but I think I can finish it.

840
01:28:25,145 --> 01:28:27,010
This part of the job's over.

841
01:28:28,181 --> 01:28:29,512
I'm the cIeaner.

842
01:28:32,652 --> 01:28:34,142
Where's the material?

843
01:28:34,554 --> 01:28:35,816
Outside.

844
01:28:44,531 --> 01:28:46,021
What's that for?

845
01:28:47,667 --> 01:28:49,259
CIeaning up your shit.

846
01:28:59,279 --> 01:29:01,008
Christ, what're you doing?

847
01:29:05,919 --> 01:29:07,181
She's not dead.

848
01:29:09,022 --> 01:29:13,391
Oh, God! Kaufman said no wetworks.
He said no wetworks. I'll call him now.

849
01:29:29,109 --> 01:29:31,634
I never did mind about the llttIe things.

850
01:29:36,716 --> 01:29:38,877
I'll go get ready for the next step.

851
01:29:56,770 --> 01:29:58,601
-You Iook nice.
-Thank you.

852
01:30:00,707 --> 01:30:02,766
All right, have a nice evening.

853
01:30:29,669 --> 01:30:30,567
Hi, Angela.

854
01:30:30,637 --> 01:30:34,164
-New driver?
-For Christ's sake, open the stupid gate!

855
01:30:40,113 --> 01:30:42,707
It went off the tracks
and I called in a cIeaner.

856
01:30:43,350 --> 01:30:44,510
What happened?

857
01:30:44,584 --> 01:30:49,180
Two down. I was afraid we'd get splashed
with shit. I told him to get it cleaned up.

858
01:30:49,723 --> 01:30:51,554
-How cIean?
-Down to the nap.

859
01:30:51,891 --> 01:30:54,724
The cIeaner's going
with your girI to Bahktiar's.

860
01:30:55,929 --> 01:30:57,453
After she finishes...

861
01:30:58,231 --> 01:30:59,892
...he'll cIean her, too.

862
01:31:21,287 --> 01:31:24,017
Of course, it was me.
I heard the bIoody thing.

863
01:31:25,759 --> 01:31:27,420
He's upstairs. You're earIy.

864
01:31:27,494 --> 01:31:29,928
-So sue me, stupid.
-Want a drink?

865
01:31:29,996 --> 01:31:32,294
Salty Dog. Leave it down here.

866
01:31:32,432 --> 01:31:33,592
I must piss.

867
01:31:47,313 --> 01:31:50,248
Go to your computer,
bring up your nucIear program.

868
01:31:51,851 --> 01:31:54,319
What are you going to accompllsh by this?

869
01:31:54,454 --> 01:31:55,443
Do it!

870
01:31:57,690 --> 01:31:59,180
Suck my dick.

871
01:32:04,264 --> 01:32:05,731
Go to your computer.

872
01:32:14,741 --> 01:32:18,541
ShouId the Arabs be the onIy peopIe
not to have this technoIogy?

873
01:32:18,812 --> 01:32:20,279
Is that what you think?

874
01:32:23,383 --> 01:32:24,441
Hurry up.

875
01:32:30,123 --> 01:32:31,647
I cannot access the data.

876
01:32:31,825 --> 01:32:33,053
Yeah, right.

877
01:32:33,359 --> 01:32:34,485
The system is down.

878
01:32:34,561 --> 01:32:36,654
Get around to the other side of the desk.

879
01:32:38,398 --> 01:32:41,993
I can make you very rich,
beyond anything you can imagine.

880
01:32:42,435 --> 01:32:45,461
And if I say I wllI, I wllI.
I'll do it, I promise.

881
01:32:51,544 --> 01:32:52,875
What's the password?

882
01:32:56,316 --> 01:32:57,715
What's the password?

883
01:33:01,788 --> 01:33:04,518
Try to imagine what a bullet
in the stomach feeIs llke.

884
01:33:10,797 --> 01:33:11,923
PeddIer.

885
01:33:38,591 --> 01:33:41,719
You can't park there.
Move around the back with the other cars.

886
01:33:44,797 --> 01:33:47,630
Are you deaf? Move the car!

887
01:34:19,132 --> 01:34:20,360
On the ground.

888
01:34:21,100 --> 01:34:24,365
Don't be a stupid bitch.
I'm offering you anything you want.

889
01:34:24,671 --> 01:34:27,970
Get on your knees, forehead to the ground,
hands behind your back.

890
01:34:31,277 --> 01:34:33,177
You think kllllng me wllI soIve anything?

891
01:34:33,246 --> 01:34:37,012
You think you can keep 800 mllllon peopIe
in the 14th century forever?

892
01:35:58,698 --> 01:36:01,030
That's it. I've had it.

893
01:39:04,183 --> 01:39:05,650
Be sure it's hooked up to it.

894
01:39:06,552 --> 01:39:08,144
Wait tllI he gets down here.

895
01:39:09,689 --> 01:39:11,281
Is there a woman down there?

896
01:39:11,457 --> 01:39:15,450
There couId be 20 women down there,
for all I know. The car's in a bad spot.

897
01:39:18,064 --> 01:39:19,258
That's it.

898
01:39:53,933 --> 01:39:55,093
You awake?

899
01:40:00,139 --> 01:40:03,108
I know you are.
I can tell by the way you're breathing.

900
01:40:07,947 --> 01:40:09,608
I'm so tired.

901
01:40:13,119 --> 01:40:14,313
My God!

902
01:40:16,122 --> 01:40:17,851
What happened to your face?

903
01:41:08,975 --> 01:41:10,067
She's gone.

904
01:41:11,110 --> 01:41:12,236
Where?

905
01:41:17,216 --> 01:41:18,148
Where?

906
01:41:18,451 --> 01:41:19,645
I don't know.

907
01:41:20,786 --> 01:41:22,583
She took off empty-handed.

908
01:41:23,356 --> 01:41:26,018
She didn't take any of her cIothes
or even her purse.

909
01:41:26,659 --> 01:41:28,650
So whoever it is you are...

910
01:41:29,562 --> 01:41:31,655
...just Ieave her alone. Let her go.

911
01:41:32,031 --> 01:41:34,556
-I can't. She's got information.
-Here.

912
01:41:37,269 --> 01:41:38,668
Why don't you get out?

913
01:41:41,140 --> 01:41:42,539
She Ieft you a note.

914
01:41:44,110 --> 01:41:45,134
Yeah?

915
01:41:46,679 --> 01:41:48,044
I tore it up.

916
01:41:49,615 --> 01:41:50,775
What did it say?

917
01:41:59,125 --> 01:42:00,615
Can I take this?

918
01:42:02,061 --> 01:42:03,153
Yeah, sure.

919
01:42:06,165 --> 01:42:07,189
You llke Nina?

920
01:42:10,436 --> 01:42:11,460
Yeah.

921
01:42:13,539 --> 01:42:14,767
I Iove her.

922
01:42:21,180 --> 01:42:22,511
We'll miss her.

923
01:42:31,590 --> 01:42:32,921
We'll miss her.

924
01:43:56,041 --> 01:43:57,941
We had a bad car wreck Iast night.

925
01:43:59,011 --> 01:44:00,342
No, no...no.

926
01:44:01,180 --> 01:44:03,171
We have all the information we need.

927
01:44:05,618 --> 01:44:06,949
The cIeaner's dead...

928
01:44:11,290 --> 01:44:12,848
...and the girI is...

929
01:44:18,397 --> 01:44:19,694
...the girI is...

930
01:44:21,667 --> 01:44:23,134
...the girI's dead, too.

931
01:44:23,803 --> 01:44:24,792
Yeah.
