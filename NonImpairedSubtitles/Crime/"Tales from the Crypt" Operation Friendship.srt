155
00:11:26,102 --> 00:11:28,970
Oh, I'd like to check out
tonight's special, please.

156
00:11:28,971 --> 00:11:31,406
Excuse me, I dropped my...

157
00:11:31,407 --> 00:11:32,641
Looks mighty tasty.

158
00:11:32,642 --> 00:11:35,410
Eddie, just give me a break, would you?
Just this once.

159
00:11:35,411 --> 00:11:38,680
Just leave me alone.
I'll do whatever you want, all right?

160
00:11:38,681 --> 00:11:40,282
Think I'll have that to go.

161
00:11:40,283 --> 00:11:42,843
-Hi!
-Got it.

162
00:11:43,386 --> 00:11:44,519
Yeah.

163
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:48,957
-So, you're a teacher?
-No, actually, I'm a psychologist.

164
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:51,426
Say what? Ow!

165
00:11:51,427 --> 00:11:52,894
-Really?
-Yeah.

166
00:11:52,895 --> 00:11:56,598
Someday I'll go into private practice,
but for now I really enjoy what I'm doing.

167
00:11:56,599 --> 00:11:58,800
Tell her you gotta go.
Tell her you're not feeling well.

168
00:11:58,801 --> 00:12:00,268
Tell her you got work to do.

169
00:12:00,269 --> 00:12:02,971
Tell her that the dog pound
makes daily deliveries to this place.

170
00:12:02,972 --> 00:12:06,741
You know, I could have used someone
like you to talk to when I was a kid.

171
00:12:06,742 --> 00:12:08,476
-Why is that?
-EDDlE: Are you out of your mind?

172
00:12:08,477 --> 00:12:09,711
Will you shut up?

173
00:12:09,712 --> 00:12:15,116
Well, I didn't have a lot of friends. I was
a lot younger than most of my classmates.

174
00:12:15,117 --> 00:12:16,218
So was l.

175
00:12:16,219 --> 00:12:18,186
Do you remember the last time
you told someone about me?

176
00:12:18,187 --> 00:12:19,654
Do you remember
Sister Mary What's Her Name,

177
00:12:19,655 --> 00:12:22,290
back in the second grade,
how she tried to break us up?

178
00:12:22,291 --> 00:12:28,291
-Would you excuse me?
-Nelson, don't you do it! Don't you do it!

179
00:12:35,204 --> 00:12:37,305
So, what were you saying?

180
00:12:37,306 --> 00:12:39,341
I was the third youngest
to graduate from my college.

181
00:12:39,342 --> 00:12:40,408
-Really?
-Yeah.

182
00:12:40,409 --> 00:12:42,444
I can't imagine the hell that
the other two people went through.

183
00:12:42,445 --> 00:12:44,945
Yeah.

184
00:12:45,715 --> 00:12:49,751
Well, that was a lot of fun.
I had a really good time and...

185
00:12:49,752 --> 00:12:52,354
-Yeah. Yeah, it was...
-Thanks.

186
00:12:52,355 --> 00:12:56,291
Maybe I could knock another night?

187
00:12:56,892 --> 00:13:03,598
Yeah, yeah. I mean, I'm right here,
so, you know, you don't have to go far.

188
00:13:03,599 --> 00:13:07,309
-Well, good night, neighbor.
-Good night.

189
00:13:18,281 --> 00:13:20,148
Don't you ever do that to me again.

190
00:13:20,149 --> 00:13:21,616
I was trying to have a conversation.

191
00:13:21,617 --> 00:13:23,752
You are the one who wanted me
to go out in the first place.

192
00:13:23,753 --> 00:13:25,320
That's before I knew what she was like.

193
00:13:25,321 --> 00:13:27,088
This is bad for us. Don't you get that?

194
00:13:27,089 --> 00:13:30,158
-Why, because she's a psychologist?
-Yes, that's got something to do with it.

195
00:13:30,159 --> 00:13:32,694
Also the fact that you like her
doesn't help a whole lot, either.

196
00:13:32,695 --> 00:13:34,696
-Eddie...
-Let me clue you in on something, mister.

197
00:13:34,697 --> 00:13:36,364
I've been with you almost 30 years.

198
00:13:36,365 --> 00:13:37,866
Thirty years at your beck and call.

199
00:13:37,867 --> 00:13:39,934
Now, how much longer you think
that bimbo's gonna stick around?

200
00:13:39,935 --> 00:13:41,036
A week? Two, maybe?

201
00:13:41,037 --> 00:13:43,605
Eddie, don't be like this. I don't know her.

202
00:13:43,606 --> 00:13:45,707
All we did was go out to dinner.

203
00:13:45,708 --> 00:13:47,242
Spare me.

204
00:13:47,243 --> 00:13:52,247
Look, I know what you're feeling, okay?
I know everything.

205
00:13:52,248 --> 00:13:53,648
I don't want any part of this.

206
00:13:53,649 --> 00:13:55,183
I always wondered
when this was gonna happen.

207
00:13:55,184 --> 00:13:58,019
Nothing happened. Where are you going?

208
00:13:58,020 --> 00:14:00,221
You think that I'm gonna wait around

209
00:14:00,222 --> 00:14:03,191
while you decide
you don't need me anymore?

210
00:14:03,192 --> 00:14:06,582
-Well, thanks, but no thanks.
-Eddie.

211
00:14:37,026 --> 00:14:39,828
You know what day it is, Nelson? Friday.

212
00:14:39,829 --> 00:14:42,997
I told Thelma you'd have that
voice-activated thing ready by Tuesday,

213
00:14:42,998 --> 00:14:44,799
Iast Tuesday.

214
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:47,569
(STAMMERlNG) I'm sorry, I just...

215
00:14:47,570 --> 00:14:51,139
I can't really concentrate.
I'm having some personal problems.

216
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:52,374
Well, you're gonna have
an even bigger problem

217
00:14:52,375 --> 00:14:57,665
here at the office
if you don't get that program written.

218
00:14:58,347 --> 00:14:59,814
And another thing...

219
00:14:59,815 --> 00:15:02,217
Come on, Jack, just leave me alone.

220
00:15:02,218 --> 00:15:06,020
So, this is the office, huh?
And that dickhead, I take it, was Jack.

221
00:15:06,021 --> 00:15:08,691
Eddie! Thank God you're here.

222
00:15:10,826 --> 00:15:12,127
Where the hell have you been?

223
00:15:12,128 --> 00:15:17,365
Well, you know, I've been here and there.
You know, thinking about things.

224
00:15:17,366 --> 00:15:21,703
Boy, no wonder you never
brought me here. Snooze-o-rama!

225
00:15:21,704 --> 00:15:25,724
So, how are things
with you and the missus?

226
00:15:26,742 --> 00:15:31,372
Yeah, well, I haven't seen her
since you left.

227
00:15:31,447 --> 00:15:34,814
I knocked on her door a few times.

228
00:15:36,218 --> 00:15:40,518
I guess you're right.
You are my only friend.

229
00:15:40,589 --> 00:15:45,693
Well, I hate to be the one to say
that I told you so, but I told you so.

230
00:15:45,694 --> 00:15:47,595
It's too bad
you didn't get anything, though.

231
00:15:47,596 --> 00:15:50,556
I mean, she had some great tits.

232
00:15:57,573 --> 00:16:02,977
EDDlE: Boy, you could fit a whole army
inside those underpants.

233
00:16:02,978 --> 00:16:04,446
Anything on the Net tonight?

234
00:16:04,447 --> 00:16:07,849
No, nothing but newbies.
I'll probably have some dinner.

235
00:16:07,850 --> 00:16:09,651
Oh, goodie. Crank up the microwave.

236
00:16:09,652 --> 00:16:12,152
(KNOCKlNG AT DOOR)

237
00:16:19,562 --> 00:16:22,062
-Hi.
-Hi.

238
00:16:22,765 --> 00:16:27,055
-How are you?
-Well, much better now, actually.

239
00:16:27,336 --> 00:16:30,271
The day after we had dinner,
I woke up sick as a dog.

240
00:16:30,272 --> 00:16:32,607
Are you kidding? Oh, my God, it was the...

241
00:16:32,608 --> 00:16:33,675
It was the Chinese.

242
00:16:33,676 --> 00:16:36,144
-Was it the Chinese?
-No, no, no. It was nothing like that.

243
00:16:36,145 --> 00:16:39,614
You know, you work around kids
and you pick up all sorts of things.

244
00:16:39,615 --> 00:16:40,748
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

245
00:16:40,749 --> 00:16:43,518
You know, you should have called me
'cause I would have come over.

246
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:46,488
-I knocked but...
-Well, I couldn't even get out of bed.

247
00:16:46,489 --> 00:16:48,223
And I would have called you

248
00:16:48,224 --> 00:16:51,292
but, you know, the phone company
didn't hook up my phone until today.

249
00:16:51,293 --> 00:16:53,695
So, anyway.

250
00:16:53,696 --> 00:16:58,466
I'm back and I'm healthy
and I'm hungry as a horse.

251
00:16:58,467 --> 00:17:01,231
So, how about dinner?

252
00:17:03,739 --> 00:17:07,209
(STAMMERlNG) Yeah, that would be great.

253
00:17:08,210 --> 00:17:10,979
Great, because I've already cooked it.

254
00:17:10,980 --> 00:17:15,016
Oh, great. Can l... I'll be there in a second.
If I could...

255
00:17:15,017 --> 00:17:19,888
-I just... I'll be right back. I'll be there.
-Okay.

256
00:17:19,889 --> 00:17:22,389
(CLEARS THROAT)

257
00:17:27,630 --> 00:17:31,225
How sweet! The lovebirds are reunited.

258
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:34,500
-Eddie.
-I won't say another word.

259
00:17:45,714 --> 00:17:49,150
Wow, this is such a great place.

260
00:17:50,019 --> 00:17:53,288
Well, I still have a lot of unpacking to do.
Thank you.

261
00:17:53,289 --> 00:17:54,389
Sure.

262
00:17:54,390 --> 00:17:57,492
You know, I've been thinking
a lot about you.

263
00:17:57,493 --> 00:18:00,933
-Yeah?
-I'm not usually this forward.

264
00:18:01,297 --> 00:18:03,565
Well, not recently, anyway.

265
00:18:03,566 --> 00:18:08,536
But I had such a great time with you
the other night.

266
00:18:09,138 --> 00:18:11,439
I just...

267
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:14,576
I don't know, I felt so relaxed. And yet...

268
00:18:14,577 --> 00:18:17,747
It's strange. It's almost as if...

269
00:18:18,781 --> 00:18:20,548
As if there was something touching me.

270
00:18:20,549 --> 00:18:23,569
-Touching you?
-Yeah, like hands,

271
00:18:23,919 --> 00:18:26,888
here, here.

272
00:18:29,658 --> 00:18:32,728
Never felt anything quite like it.

273
00:18:33,262 --> 00:18:35,762
Do you mind if I kiss you?

274
00:18:36,532 --> 00:18:39,032
No, I don't mind.

275
00:19:01,624 --> 00:19:03,591
Was it good for you, too?

276
00:19:03,592 --> 00:19:05,793
Eddie, please.

277
00:19:05,794 --> 00:19:08,262
Okay, you got what you wanted.
Now, let's move on.

278
00:19:08,263 --> 00:19:12,653
-What do you mean, move on?
-You and her, over.

279
00:19:21,377 --> 00:19:26,077
I'm afraid I can't let you do that
to me anymore.

280
00:19:28,717 --> 00:19:31,417
-Close, but no cigar.
-Eddie!

281
00:19:32,621 --> 00:19:34,989
I figured out lots of things
while I was away, Nelson.

282
00:19:34,990 --> 00:19:37,925
-Lots of things.
-Eddie, it's okay. You don't have to go.

283
00:19:37,926 --> 00:19:39,761
I wasn't planning to.

284
00:19:39,762 --> 00:19:42,664
The way I figured,
she's the one going someplace.

285
00:19:42,665 --> 00:19:46,200
-I'll tell you what. Pick up a pillow.
-What?

286
00:19:46,201 --> 00:19:50,561
Yeah, pick up a pillow
and put it on her face.

287
00:19:50,773 --> 00:19:52,340
Pick it up!

288
00:19:52,341 --> 00:19:53,875
No, I'm not gonna pick it up.

289
00:19:53,876 --> 00:19:55,777
Okay, that's fine.

290
00:19:55,778 --> 00:19:59,958
Let me show you another trick
that I learned.

Nelson Patrick DeMers,

292
00:20:02,217 --> 00:20:06,187
you think you're so smart.
I'll show you what smart is.

Pretty good, huh?

294

She never did like you much.
Check this out.

295
00:20:11,894 --> 00:20:15,284
Hey, DeMers, you better start running!

296
00:20:15,798 --> 00:20:19,634
Jaimie McKenna. Boy,
did he used to kick the shit out of you.

297
00:20:19,635 --> 00:20:21,102
Well, you're gonna have
an even bigger problem

298
00:20:21,103 --> 00:20:22,670
if you don't get that program written.

299

-Oh, please.

you think you're so smart.
I'll show you what smart is.

301

Hey, DeMers, you better start running!

302
00:20:27,209 --> 00:20:28,609
JACK:...if you don't get
that program written.

303
00:20:28,610 --> 00:20:31,612
-...you better start running.
-...don't get that program written.

304
00:20:31,613 --> 00:20:33,648
-...you think you're so smart.

Man, this shit runs deep and dark
inside your head.

308

You think Sleeping Beauty there
is gonna save you from all this like I have?

309
00:20:46,161 --> 00:20:48,661
I don't think so.

That's right.

You know what to do. Do it.

314
00:21:00,109 --> 00:21:02,909
Do it. Come on, Nelson. Do it.

315
00:21:19,428 --> 00:21:22,330
You can run but you can't hide.

Yeah, of course I'll be home for dinner.

I just got a few finishing touches
to do on this program

322
00:21:48,056 --> 00:21:50,825
and then I got a few finishing touches
that got your name on it, all right?

Where's the schedule
for the voice-activation presentation?

It was supposed to be
on my desk yesterday.

(STUTTERlNG) I'm working on it.

Nelson, I can't tell you how impressed
we've been with your performance lately.

These past few days,
it's like you're a new man or something.

Oh, well, I'll tell you, Thelma.

The only person
holding me back before was me.

So I simply got me out of the way.

I see VP stripes in your future.

the next, he's aghast in his own home.
