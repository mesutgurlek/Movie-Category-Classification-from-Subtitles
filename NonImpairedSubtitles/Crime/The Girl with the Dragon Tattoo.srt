It wasn't meant to be.

1075
01:18:28,970 --> 01:18:31,598
When I write about people,
I try to entertain the reader.

1076
01:18:31,807 --> 01:18:33,741
Wennerström wasn't
entertained much.

1077
01:18:37,245 --> 01:18:41,181
Uh, your boss, Armansky,

1078
01:18:41,383 --> 01:18:44,750
yeah, he tells me you only
do jobs that interest you,

1079
01:18:44,953 --> 01:18:47,421
so I suppose
I should be flattered.

1080
01:18:48,223 --> 01:18:49,952
You gonna sit down?

1081
01:18:50,759 --> 01:18:56,561
He also says that you're
the one he goes to when
the job is, um, sensitive.

1082
01:18:56,765 --> 01:19:00,667
That's the word he used,
"sensitive." I'm gonna use
"illegal,"

1083
01:19:00,869 --> 01:19:03,963
because that's what it was
when you hacked into my computer.

1084
01:19:04,172 --> 01:19:07,073
No, I'm not gonna do anything
about that. I could, but I won't.

1085
01:19:07,275 --> 01:19:09,869
What I'm gonna do
is I'm gonna tell you a story,

1086
01:19:10,078 --> 01:19:13,809
and if it entertains you,
maybe you'll decide to
help me research further.

1087
01:19:14,015 --> 01:19:17,109
And if not, I'll do the washing up
and you'll never see me again.

1088
01:19:18,286 --> 01:19:20,220
Here, you should eat that.

1089
01:19:20,956 --> 01:19:22,423
What kind of research?

1090
01:19:22,991 --> 01:19:25,084
Lisbeth... Oh, can I call you Lisbeth?

1091
01:19:27,028 --> 01:19:29,155
I want you to help me catch
a killer of women.

1092
01:19:30,966 --> 01:19:34,595
I've got R.J. Rebecka Jacobsson.
I've got absolutely no idea

1093
01:19:34,803 --> 01:19:37,363
who the rest of these are
or how they're connected

1094
01:19:37,572 --> 01:19:40,541
to the death of a 16-year-old girl,
but they must be somehow.

1095
01:19:40,742 --> 01:19:43,973
What we've gotta do is find out who
they are, what happened to them,
