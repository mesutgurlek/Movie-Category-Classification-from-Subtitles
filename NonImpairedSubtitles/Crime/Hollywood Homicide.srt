1
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,600
Shooters, come forward
to the 20-yard line.

2
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:01,400
Thanks, Joe.

3
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:11,100
Oh, shit.

4
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:18,300
Yo, K-Ro,
where you going, man?

5
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,100
- K-Ro, what's up?
- Hey, baby.

6
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:13,900
Somebody just shot my club up.
That's what I say, shot my club up.

7
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:16,700
What you need to know my name?
Get the police.

8
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:19,600
What do you mean you ain't coming?

9
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:22,300
I give you first shot
at making me an offer...

10
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:24,600
...on this four-bedroom
Mt. Olympus...

11
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:27,400
...and you leave me
sitting here two hours...

12
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:30,500
...and now you're telling me
you ain't... Hello?

13
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:35,100
Shit.

14
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,200
Gavilan.

15
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:48,100
Yeah, give me 10 minutes.
Be right there.

16
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:01,400
Yeah, it's Calden.

17
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:04,000
Oh, shit.

18
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:06,500
I'll be there in seven minutes. Yeah.

19
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:26,800
- Hi, Joe. How you doing?
- Okay, how are you?

20
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:35,100
Find anybody to buy
that house yet?

21
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:40,200
No. Showed it a couple of times
last week. There's some interest.

22
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,400
- I hear we got a messy one here.
- Yeah.

23
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:44,800
Joe, K.C.

24
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:46,600
- Hey, Leon.
- Hey.

25
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:49,100
I'm making you two
primaries in this disaster.

26
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:53,200
Since you've made no progress in the
Klepto murder, I figure you're due.

27
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:55,600
- Thanks for the confidence.
- No problem.

28
00:06:55,900 --> 00:06:58,600
- Do you have a body count?
- Can we get a statement?

29
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:02,400
- What do we got, Leon?
- One on the floor, three backstage.

30
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:06,100
Rap group, calls itself H2OKlick.
Don't ask me why.

31
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:07,700
- Joint was full?
- Yeah.

32
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,600
- Nobody saw it.
- Of course not.

33
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:12,900
- Are these things on?
- They were. They're off now.

34
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:17,800
Listen, get them out of here.
Now, come on.

35
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:19,900
Let's go.

36
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:01,200
Well, what do you think?

37
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:04,100
Write this down.

38
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:09,500
Cheeseburger, well-done.

39
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:14,000
Raw onion, pickle, ketchup.
Nothing else.

40
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:16,700
Got it.

41
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:19,800
Officer.

42
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:26,400
Time to get rolling on some chow.
This is what the big dog wants.

43
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:30,700
And I want tomato and cucumber
on whole wheat...

44
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:32,800
...with only mustard
and bean sprouts.

45
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:52,600
Hey, Lou, nobody
goes in here, okay?

46
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,500
Got you.

47
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:06,000
It looks like one shooter came
from down there.

48
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:08,200
The other came from down there.

49
00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:11,700
This poor son of a bitch
got it from both sides.

50
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,400
- Yeah.
- How long you had this place?

51
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:17,600
Man, I only had this place two years.
This is messed up.

52
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,700
- Where you living?
- At the Bel Age.

53
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,500
- Bel Age?
- Right up the road...

54
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:23,400
...but it's just temporary.

55
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:26,700
- Where were you when it occurred?
- In my office. Right there.

56
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:29,900
- These guys were about to break out.
- The boys was blowing up.

57
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:33,600
Sartain Records.
Antoine Sartain, that's the big man.

58
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:37,000
- These guys have any trouble?
- Some sort of turf war?

59
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:39,800
I know nothing about no
East Coast-West Coast...

60
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:41,900
...hip-hop, gangbanging bullshit.

61
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:44,500
I'm just a poor country boy
trying to get by.

62
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:47,200
- Getting by pretty well, I'd say.
- I do okay.

63
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:49,700
Hello? Hold on. Hello?

64
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:54,000
Hello? Hold on just a second, let me...

65
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:56,600
Hey, Stan.

66
00:09:56,800 --> 00:10:00,000
Stan, that four-bedroom
Mt. Olympus fell through.

67
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:01,800
Can you make me an offer?

68
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:11,800
Eddie, you got those shoe prints?

69
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:14,600
Two prints.
Matching pattern, different sizes.

70
00:10:14,900 --> 00:10:17,400
That's a 9. That's an 11.

71
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:31,200
Hey, you, come here.
I see mayonnaise.

72
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:34,700
Did anybody in this room
hear me say the word mayonnaise?

73
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:36,600
Read your notes.
What does it say?

74
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:39,300
Cheeseburger, well-done,
ketchup, pickle.

75
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:41,400
You call that well-done?

76
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:44,300
In addition to the mayonnaise...

77
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:47,800
...I see lettuce that somebody
tried to scrape off here.

78
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:49,800
This is a disaster.

79
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:52,000
What do they teach you
at the Academy?

80
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:54,000
You want to be a detective?

81
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:57,300
- Yes, sir.
- Don't call me sir. I work for a living.

82
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:00,200
Dump this for me, please.
I expect better.

83
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:03,700
- Joe, kid's got something.
- Gavilan.

84
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:06,000
No, 675 won't fly.

85
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:09,300
If you're gonna get back to me,
have at least 7 and change.

86
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:13,400
Diamond earring.

87
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:17,800
Could be something,
could be nothing. Good work, kid.

88
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:21,100
Did you get the piss and
the shoe prints in the closet?

89
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:23,200
Yeah, I got it, Joe.

90
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:25,900
I'm gonna go hammer
on the owner a little more.

91
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:26,800
How come you got no video
surveillance, big-ass place like this?

92
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:29,200
How come you got no video
surveillance, big-ass place like this?

93
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:32,600
- What kind of security you got?
- I ain't never had no problems.

94
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:35,500
You got a problem now.
Two guys sneak in with guns.

95
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:40,400
- Who does your security anyway?
- A bunch of off-duty L.A.P.D. Cops.

96
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:42,000
That's your first mistake.

97
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:46,300
Man, why you ragging on me?
All I'm trying to do is just business.

98
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:49,800
Julius, you're making me curious.
How come you live in a hotel?

99
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,600
I just sold my crib.
The new one fell through.

100
00:11:52,900 --> 00:11:56,100
So I'm sort of, like,
looking right now.

101
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:59,500
You're sort of looking
for a new house?

102
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:01,800
That's what I said.

103
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:06,000
Julius, look...

104
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:10,600
...in my other career
I'm a real-estate broker.

105
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:13,300
Real-estate broker?
You got two jobs?

106
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:15,700
We work a lot of overtime,
we get time off.

107
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:18,500
A lot of guys have three jobs.

108
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:20,700
- What you saying?
- What I'm saying...

109
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:23,700
...is I got a beautiful 3400-square-foot
house on Mt. Olympus.

110
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:26,700
New roof, partial view.
Owner's desperate.

111
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,600
Man, I don't want no crap
on no Mt. Olympics.

112
00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:35,300
Well, what you looking for?

113
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:39,900
I'm looking for a big house,
something with class.

114
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:42,900
How much will you pay
for something with class?

115
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:46,000
Not a penny more than 6.

116
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:50,400
- Six?
- That's what I said, 6.

117
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:54,700
Million?

118
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,700
I was not soliciting.
I was doing research.

119
00:12:57,900 --> 00:12:59,800
Research is not soliciting.

120
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,200
I've never had to pay for sex.
I have four BAFTA nominations.

121
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:05,800
Evening, Gloria.
Do you know who I am?

122
00:13:09,900 --> 00:13:13,000
- Here's our dead guys.
- Thanks.

123
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:16,600
The puddle of piss makes me think
we got a witness.

124
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:22,100
- Just sit down there and shut up.
- You shut up.

125
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:24,100
I can't work here.
This place is a zoo.

126
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:26,900
Let's get out of here
before Boardner's closes.

127
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:30,000
The doctor's in. Help's on its way.

128
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:31,900
Thanks, Hank.

129
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:37,800
- Something wrong, Joe?
- What do you mean, "wrong"?

130
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:40,800
You seem down.

131
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:43,400
Down? Me?

132
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:45,800
Lately. Yeah.

133
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:50,100
We've been partners for four months.
Now you want to be my shrink?

134
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:54,400
Sometimes it helps to talk.
That's all I'm saying.

135
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:01,100
All right.

136
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,100
Let me paint you a picture.

137
00:14:05,900 --> 00:14:09,200
Portrait of Joe Gavilan.

138
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:13,000
Seven, eight years ago,
I sold the results...

139
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:16,800
...of my entrepreneurial efforts
up to that point.

140
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:18,600
Three tanning salons...

141
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:24,200
...and two original silk-tip
nail parlors in the Antelope Valley.

142
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:26,300
And I started attending...

143
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:29,900
...weekend real-estate seminars
at the airport Hyatt.

144
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:32,800
You know, how to make
a million dollars...

145
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:35,300
...in real estate
with very little money down.

146
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:36,500
Sounds good.

147
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:38,600
Started with a condo
in Sherman Oaks.

148
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:41,600
Slapped paint on the walls.
Refaced the kitchen cabinets.

149
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,200
Traded up to a smoke-damaged
ranch in Tarzana.

150
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:48,500
Then a Spanish on Outpost...

151
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:52,500
...and a fake Mediterranean
in Los Feliz.

152
00:14:52,900 --> 00:14:57,100
Pretty soon I had everything
I've got tied up in this...

153
00:14:57,500 --> 00:15:01,100
...this monstrosity on Mt. Olympus...

154
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:05,400
...at the corner of Hercules
and, I shit you not, Achilles.

155
00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:07,800
- What's the problem?
- The problem is...

156
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:12,000
...if I don't score a big commission
or get rid of this...

157
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:15,500
...piece of shit on Mt. Olympus...

158
00:15:15,900 --> 00:15:19,000
Well, the word Titanic
comes to mind.

159
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:22,600
Joe, I know a girl who works
for some rich producer.

160
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:26,500
Says he might sell his place.
Maybe you can get the listing.

161
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:29,700
- Got a name?
- Her name's like Minnie or Moma.

162
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:32,300
Something like that,
I don't remember.

163
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,900
Not the girl, hot rocks,
the producer.

164
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:41,100
Oh, I don't know the producer.
Way before my time.

165
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:47,600
- Hey, Joe, you ready for something?
- Shoot.

166
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,700
I don't think I want
to be a cop anymore.

167
00:15:54,900 --> 00:15:57,600
Come on, you need some fresh air.

168
00:15:57,900 --> 00:16:00,400
- Put this on my tab, Hank.
- What tab?

169
00:16:00,900 --> 00:16:03,500
Hey, I got it. I got it. It's okay.

170
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:06,700
Here.

171
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:12,200
If you don't want to be a cop,
what do you want to be?

172
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:21,000
I want to be an actor.

173
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:24,300
- You wanna be what?
- An actor.

174
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:26,900
What?

175
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:29,300
Okay.

176
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:33,300
- You're gay. I can deal with that.
- You know I'm not gay.

177
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:36,200
Why do you want to do
something stupid like acting?

178
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:38,900
Because it's my bliss.

179
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:42,100
And I have to follow my bliss.

180
00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:44,300
Turning into Oprah around here.

181
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:46,800
I rented a theater
on Highland, Friday night.

182
00:16:46,900 --> 00:16:50,300
I invited some agents and producers.
It's called a showcase.

183
00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:52,900
- What are you showcasing?
- My talents.

184
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:55,200
Mr. Robert De Niro here.

185
00:16:55,800 --> 00:17:00,000
Hey, detective, you're gonna say
it's none of my business...

186
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:02,200
...but when's the last time
you got laid?

187
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:05,600
None of your business.

188
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:07,600
Right.

189
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:36,900
Say it ain't so, Joe.

190
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:40,200
Oh, my God.

191
00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:43,000
Jesus Christ.

192
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:46,800
- How's business, Jack?
- Wanda.

193
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:51,600
- Wanda.
- Some trick's thumping on prostitutes.

194
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:55,400
We put our best female officer
undercover and she got hurt, so...

195
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:57,000
...I'm the bait.

196
00:17:58,100 --> 00:17:59,800
Well, you look good.

197
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:02,500
Well, it never hurts
to get a compliment...

198
00:18:02,900 --> 00:18:05,100
...but that's not why
I was shaking my booty at you.

199
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:08,800
You're working that bloodbath
over at the Freeway Club.

200
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:10,900
The word's out
about the shooting.

201
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:13,800
Word is one guy slid out
without a scratch.

202
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:18,200
- Got a name or anything?
- K-Ro, K-Mart or something like that.

203
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:20,200
He was the group's
main songwriter.

204
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:23,700
- Somebody writes that shit?
- Yeah, tell me about it.

205
00:18:24,300 --> 00:18:26,500
Want me to drop you
back where I got you?

206
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:28,600
Yeah, I got backup to pick me up.

207
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,300
Just swing me
back around to Cherokee.

208
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:34,800
These heels are killing me.
Just killing me, man.

209
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:48,600
This is Ruby the psychic,
Ruby the night owl...

210
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:52,900
...waiting for your calls,
your problems, your concerns.

211
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:56,500
Want to unravel the past?
Ruby can help.

212
00:19:56,900 --> 00:19:59,600
Want to sort out the present?
Ruby can help.

213
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:03,100
Want to look into the future?
Ruby can do that too.

214
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:07,200
Just pick up the phone.
Smokey, where have you been?

215
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:08,900
Busy guy, Ruby.

216
00:20:09,300 --> 00:20:12,400
- Got something to share?
- Tell me about the future.

217
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:16,100
I see some financial concerns.
Is that right?

218
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:17,600
Yep.

219
00:20:17,900 --> 00:20:22,800
Wait a minute. I'm seeing something
dangerous, maybe painful?

220
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:24,400
What else is new?

221
00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:26,700
Whatever else is new
will have to wait.

222
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:29,100
We're out of time.
Why do you call so late?

223
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:32,100
Night owls, this is Ruby.

224
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:53,800
Mr. Sartain and I'd like to thank you.

225
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,100
I'm Mr. Sartain's colleague,
Leroy Wasley.

226
00:20:56,400 --> 00:21:00,200
- Tell Mr. Sartain the deed's done.
- Now where's our money?

227
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:04,000
Here you go.

228
00:21:04,300 --> 00:21:05,900
Oh, shit.

229
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:17,000
Tell me something, man. You think
Gavilan can figure this thing out?

230
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:20,000
Bennie Macko's not gonna let him.
He'll take him down.

231
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:22,900
Why would Bennie Macko
believe all this bullshit?

232
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:25,100
I've known Bennie a long time.

233
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:27,600
He graduated in the class
behind mine at the academy.

234
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:30,800
We were rookies together
in the same division.

235
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:34,800
He's a politically ambitious suit.

236
00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:40,600
- He listens to what I tell him.
- Patience is not one of my virtues.

237
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:44,300
Let me explain something.

238
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:47,300
You can kill a street
punk like Klepto. It's no big deal.

239
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:50,500
These two bangers,
they didn't mean anything to anybody.

240
00:21:50,900 --> 00:21:55,300
But you send them into an open
nightclub, and they cap four guys?

241
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:57,100
That's another mess altogether.

242
00:21:57,900 --> 00:22:02,100
The last time I checked, I pay you
to run my security, not your mouth.

243
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:43,000
Let go of me,
you sons of bitches!

244
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:45,000
Stella!

245
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:48,200
Stella!

246
00:23:48,300 --> 00:23:49,500
Stella!

247
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:52,800
Stella!

248
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:17,100
Not a knickknack, knit-lock,
knock-kneed knickerbocker sock...

249
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:20,000
...off a hodgepodge, moss-blotched,
botched Scotch block.

250
00:24:20,300 --> 00:24:21,000
I got more time in the third-floor
crapper than you do on the job.

251
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,600
I got more time in the third-floor
crapper than you do on the job.

252
00:24:23,900 --> 00:24:26,600
You can't open my locker without
a warrant. I know my rights.

253
00:24:26,900 --> 00:24:30,500
Well, I appreciate a man who knows
his rights. There you go.

254
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:38,000
- What's going on here, cap?
- This is Bennie Macko, Internal Affairs.

255
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:41,900
- You got a right to an attorney.
- This is an authorized investigation...

256
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:44,400
...within the jurisdiction
of Los Angeles.

257
00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:48,100
- Oh, please. I'll open it.
- Go ahead.

258
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:58,100
- I haven't been in there in 10 years.
- You open it.

259
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:12,300
Oh, here are those shoes.
I thought I lost these.

260
00:25:12,500 --> 00:25:14,900
- I love these shoes.
- Ever clean your locker?

261
00:25:15,300 --> 00:25:18,000
Between finding, apprehending
and convicting murderers...

262
00:25:18,300 --> 00:25:21,100
...and cleaning, I made
a decision to do the former.

263
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:23,000
- You got a lot of lip.
- A lot of lip.

264
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:25,500
- Yeah, you do.
- I got a big nose too.

265
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:27,700
Calden, open your locker.

266
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:31,400
- Why him?
- He's your partner. Go ahead, open it.

267
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:33,800
No, don't open it.

268
00:25:39,300 --> 00:25:43,300
- You got something to hide?
- Yeah, kind of.

269
00:25:46,700 --> 00:25:48,600
You got to do it, son.

270
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,800
Porno.

271
00:26:22,700 --> 00:26:25,300
Commingling funds, huh?

272
00:26:25,900 --> 00:26:27,600
That's my crime?

273
00:26:27,900 --> 00:26:30,100
Commingling? Guilty.

274
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:32,500
My alimony, number one,
comes from money...

275
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:34,300
...commingled
with my beer money.

276
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:37,800
My refinanced car commingled with
the short-term loan to keep the...

277
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:42,000
...second mortgage paid, commingled
with my alimony number three...

278
00:26:42,300 --> 00:26:44,300
...commingled with
every goddamn dime...

279
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:46,900
...I've got tied up
in my Mt. Olympus property.

280
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:48,700
My whole life's commingled.

281
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,800
I'm glad you brought up
Mt. Olympus.

282
00:26:51,100 --> 00:26:53,400
You're attempting to sell
without disclosing you own it.

283
00:26:53,500 --> 00:26:56,100
This isn't about real estate,
is it, Bennie?

284
00:26:56,500 --> 00:26:59,500
What's going on here? As immediate
supervisor of these men...

285
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:02,200
...you are bound to inform me
of any investigation.

286
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:04,600
- You're informed.
- You couldn't tell me?

287
00:27:04,700 --> 00:27:07,100
I'm trying to find out
what I'm guilty of...

288
00:27:07,300 --> 00:27:10,400
...besides going to one too many
airport real-estate seminars.

289
00:27:10,700 --> 00:27:13,500
Well, for starters, you know
a woman named Cleo Ricard?

290
00:27:13,700 --> 00:27:15,700
I talk to her. Talk's cheap.

291
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:19,100
Administrative Vice, which has
been watching her for two years...

292
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:21,600
...is making a major prostitution bust...

293
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,600
...and you're making promises
to her to intervene.

294
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:27,000
You haven't registered her
as an informant.

295
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:30,500
- Joe, is this true?
- By itself, that's cause for suspension.

296
00:27:30,900 --> 00:27:34,700
I mentioned her name to District
Attorney Gardner six weeks ago.

297
00:27:34,900 --> 00:27:37,300
- Told him I was gonna make a contact.
- He denies it.

298
00:27:37,700 --> 00:27:40,500
He's a liar! I haven't registered
her as an informant...

299
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:42,100
...because she hasn't informed.

300
00:27:42,500 --> 00:27:44,900
I don't want to get
buried under paperwork...

301
00:27:45,100 --> 00:27:48,200
...just so Vice can tell me
to back off their suspect.

302
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:50,600
It's a big case for them.

303
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:56,000
- Bigger than a quadruple murder?
- This is not your decision.

304
00:27:56,400 --> 00:28:00,300
As no charges have been made,
release Gavilan and Calden...

305
00:28:00,700 --> 00:28:02,600
...so they can resume investigations.

306
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:04,900
- Bennie?
- Yeah, we'll talk about it.

307
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:08,500
- When he's out of the room.
- Fuck you very much.

308
00:28:17,300 --> 00:28:20,300
- What is with that Macko guy?
- Oh, he's a jerk.

309
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:24,000
Years ago, he was lead detective
on those jockey love-nest murders.

310
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:26,300
You remember, big girls, little guys?

311
00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:29,300
He bragged to the papers.
I proved he had the wrong guy.

312
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:33,500
Embarrassed the shit out of him.
He's been wanting to get me since.

313
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:37,700
Now he's assigned to IA,
and he's taking his shot.

314
00:28:38,100 --> 00:28:41,800
- You can't trust cops.
- Your dad was a cop.

315
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:45,200
He was killed in the line of duty
under bullshit circumstances.

316
00:28:45,500 --> 00:28:48,200
No one was held responsible,
and his case was closed.

317
00:28:48,900 --> 00:28:50,300
The feds investigate?

318
00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:52,900
The word is they thought
his partner was dirty...

319
00:28:53,100 --> 00:28:56,500
...but the report's sealed tight.

320
00:28:56,900 --> 00:28:59,100
I got a pal down there
who owes me a favor.

321
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:02,400
You wanna see the report,
I'll make a call.

322
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:04,700
I'd appreciate it. Yeah.

323
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:09,800
Hey, Joe, listen, what I said last night
about you getting laid...

324
00:29:10,300 --> 00:29:12,000
...it's none of my business,
you know?

325
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:13,700
It's no big deal.

326
00:29:13,900 --> 00:29:16,300
Just be safe.

327
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,700
- Safe?
- Yeah.

328
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:26,000
That hooker last night.

329
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:29,200
That was a guy.

330
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:31,800
I don't need to know that.

331
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:36,600
That was a cop.
That was a guy cop.

332
00:29:37,100 --> 00:29:38,300
A cop guy.

333
00:29:40,100 --> 00:29:41,700
- Gavilan.
- "Hello, Joe?"

334
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:43,200
Cleo, I was just talking about you.

335
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:45,500
Cleo, I was just talking about you.

336
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:47,400
I hope it was something good.

337
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:51,500
Listen, Joe, I have a little problem.
Vice is breathing down my neck.

338
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,300
Yeah, well, IA's
breathing down mine.

339
00:29:54,500 --> 00:29:56,200
Let's go.

340
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:58,200
Come on, big boy.

341
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:01,400
- Well, I might have something for you.
- I'm listening.

342
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:05,100
Is this the William Morris Agency?
Yeah. Hi, this is K.C. Calden.

343
00:30:05,500 --> 00:30:07,000
I sent a headshot, résumé...

344
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:10,200
...and an invitation to a performance
of "Streetcar Named Desire."

345
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:13,800
Hold it while I get something
out of the trunk. Where you going?

346
00:30:14,100 --> 00:30:15,700
It's on Friday.

347
00:30:16,100 --> 00:30:19,800
One of the girls was a regular
for one of the guys shot last night.

348
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
She was also a regular of Klepto's.

349
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:24,800
You talk to Vice and get them
to back off me...

350
00:30:25,100 --> 00:30:27,600
- "... and I'll talk to her".
- Not the way it works.

351
00:30:27,900 --> 00:30:29,300
Give me the girl first.

352
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:32,800
Joe, why don't I send you over
a couple of ladies?

353
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:36,900
Big mistake. Big, big mistake.

354
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:39,700
You can have a party on me.

355
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,800
We'll keep it out of the book.
What do you say?

356
00:30:43,100 --> 00:30:46,500
Not my style, Cleo. Call me back
when you got something real.

357
00:30:46,700 --> 00:30:49,500
Yeah, I'll be playing the Brando part.

358
00:30:50,300 --> 00:30:51,200
Hello?

359
00:30:51,300 --> 00:30:52,000
Hello?

360
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:54,100
Let's go.

361
00:31:03,300 --> 00:31:04,800
I'll call you back.

362
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:29,700
- I'm gonna take him, Joe.
- No, no, no. The gun's still hot!

363
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:37,400
Stay down there. Stay down.
Stay down, man. Stay there.

364
00:31:37,700 --> 00:31:40,100
Got a live gun here.
You'll get yourself shot.

365
00:31:40,300 --> 00:31:43,800
What are you talking about?
It's a standard Beretta, 15 shots.

366
00:31:44,100 --> 00:31:47,200
- I counted.
- And one in the spout.

367
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:50,400
- Oh, shit.
- Did you lose this?

368
00:31:56,100 --> 00:31:59,100
- How do I look?
- You look all right.

369
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:01,400
Many thanks. Now the buttons.

370
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:06,100
I can't do nothing with them.

371
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:08,500
You men with your big,
clumsy fingers.

372
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:10,600
May I have a drag on your cig?

373
00:32:11,300 --> 00:32:12,900
What?

374
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:17,000
- Okay.
- Who writes this stuff?

375
00:32:17,300 --> 00:32:19,400
Look, it's not stuff. It's art.

376
00:32:19,900 --> 00:32:22,100
In fact, it's one of the
greatest plays ever.

377
00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:25,100
And it's not the words you're
having trouble with.

378
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:28,100
It's the lack of conviction.
If you give it conviction...

379
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:30,100
...we can have a back-and-forth.

380
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:32,700
I know you're playing a girl,
but come on.

381
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:34,600
- What is this about?
- Just read.

382
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:37,100
It's your turn.

383
00:32:41,500 --> 00:32:44,200
You look like you raided
some stylish shops in Paris.

384
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:47,300
No, wait a second,
you skipped a line.

385
00:32:47,900 --> 00:32:50,800
As a matter of fact,
you skipped a bunch of lines.

386
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:53,000
Never mind, we're here.

387
00:33:04,900 --> 00:33:08,900
K.C. Calden, Hollywood Homicide.
We're here to see Antoine Sartain.

388
00:33:09,300 --> 00:33:11,300
He's in recording studio B, I think.

389
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:15,500
- Is he expecting you?
- Kind of.

390
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:18,100
Homicide, I want to talk
to Antoine Sartain.

391
00:33:18,300 --> 00:33:20,700
You gentlemen
have an appointment?

392
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:22,200
You off-duty L.A.P.D.?

393
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:25,900
- You giving me a hard time?
- It's called a homicide investigation.

394
00:33:26,100 --> 00:33:29,400
- Well, you're not going in.
- My God, he has a badge and a gun.

395
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:31,600
Come on, get out
of the way, will you?

396
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:34,400
What? A cop's gonna
hit a cop now?

397
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:38,400
That's a good suggestion.

398
00:33:38,700 --> 00:33:41,800
I'm filing police brutality charges.
Assault, harassment.

399
00:33:42,100 --> 00:33:45,400
Let me help you out there.
Sergeant Willoughby. Gavilan.

400
00:33:45,700 --> 00:33:48,400
How's Betty?
The kids? Okay, good.

401
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:52,100
Look, I got an off-duty cop who wants
to file a complaint against me.

402
00:33:52,500 --> 00:33:54,400
Hold on a second.

403
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:59,700
There's been a misunderstanding.

404
00:34:01,100 --> 00:34:02,200
Thanks a lot.

405
00:34:03,300 --> 00:34:05,600
Finally, this is the take.
This is the one.

406
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:07,800
This is it, Butch.
This is the one.

407
00:34:08,100 --> 00:34:10,500
Come on in. That's the best take.

408
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:18,000
We need some bells,
because this ain't happening.

409
00:34:18,300 --> 00:34:22,300
- Bells?
- Everybody's using bells, man.

410
00:34:22,700 --> 00:34:25,200
- We need some radio.
- Guys, excuse me.

411
00:34:25,700 --> 00:34:27,600
- My opinion is gold.
- Antoine Sartain?

412
00:34:27,900 --> 00:34:31,300
- What did I say to you?
- Hold up.

413
00:34:31,700 --> 00:34:34,600
- Antoine Sartain?
- Please, hold up.

414
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:37,200
- L.A.P.D. Homicide.
- What's this supposed to be?

415
00:34:37,500 --> 00:34:40,500
- Who are you, coming in here?
- I'm looking for Antoine Sartain.

416
00:34:41,100 --> 00:34:44,600
Turn the music down.
Turn the music down.

417
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:48,000
Chill on the real. On the real, chill.
Because you know what?

418
00:34:48,300 --> 00:34:51,100
What you want, man?
You Hollywood dicks are all the same.

419
00:34:51,500 --> 00:34:52,900
Hey.

420
00:34:53,100 --> 00:34:55,600
You all saw that, right?
That's police brutality.

421
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,600
- Don't think I won't report you.
- Help me out here.

422
00:34:58,900 --> 00:35:01,700
Do you know this guy?
Help me out.

423
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:03,900
Do you know this guy?

424
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:07,500
Because I don't recognize him.
These the same guys?

425
00:35:08,100 --> 00:35:09,600
These your friends?

426
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:14,200
- Yeah, we know these guys.
- That's my boy, man.

427
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:17,500
Do you know where
I can find Mr. Sartain?

428
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:23,500
He just left. He's on the 10th floor.

429
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:28,100
- Elevator's over there.
- Thank you very much.

430
00:35:31,500 --> 00:35:33,600
K.C. Calden?

431
00:35:33,900 --> 00:35:38,300
- Silk Brown, baby. Crenshaw High.
- Oh, yeah. How you doing, brother?

432
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:40,700
I'm all right. Told you I knew this dude.

433
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:43,800
I'll stick around here and see
if I can find out anything.

434
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:46,200
Look at him!
Didn't know you were a cop, man.

435
00:35:46,500 --> 00:35:49,500
Actually, I'm thinking about
getting out of this L.A.P.D. Shit.

436
00:35:49,900 --> 00:35:52,800
- What you working, man?
- I did some acting in high school.

437
00:35:53,100 --> 00:35:56,100
- Thinking about the movie thing.
- I knew we came for a reason.

438
00:35:56,400 --> 00:36:01,400
- Baby, talk to him. Go ahead.
- Well, I did a Jell-O commercial once.

439
00:36:01,700 --> 00:36:05,800
- That's right. The blue Jell-O girl.
- That was me. J-E-L-L-O.

440
00:36:06,100 --> 00:36:08,900
- You did a great job. Congratulations.
- Thank you.

441
00:36:09,300 --> 00:36:12,600
- She sold a shitload of Jell-O too.
- I believe that.

442
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:19,500
This is nice.

443
00:36:21,700 --> 00:36:25,400
Trying to imagine what it was like
when this was all still glamorous.

444
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:29,100
It's been a long time since anything
happened at Hollywood and Vine.

445
00:36:29,500 --> 00:36:33,700
- Can I offer you something? Anything?
- No, I just want to ask a few questions.

446
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,500
Oh, sure. Sure.

447
00:36:36,900 --> 00:36:39,500
- Have a seat, please.
- Thanks.

448
00:36:45,100 --> 00:36:48,000
So how long ago did you sign...

449
00:36:49,300 --> 00:36:52,600
...H2OKlick?
- Five years ago.

450
00:36:53,500 --> 00:36:56,200
I don't really know this music.

451
00:36:56,600 --> 00:36:58,800
- Were they good?
- Most people don't know this.

452
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,500
But I lose money on 19
out of 20 new groups.

453
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:06,200
But one breakout...
One breakout pays for everything.

454
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:09,300
Were these guys gonna break out?

455
00:37:09,900 --> 00:37:11,400
They had a chance, yeah.

456
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,400
You know these fellas personally?

457
00:37:16,300 --> 00:37:18,400
I can't afford to get
too close to my acts.

458
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:21,500
Because, sooner or later,
I'm gonna have to be the guy...

459
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:25,100
...that doesn't renew their contracts.
- Brutal business.

460
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:28,200
Brutal business. Brutal.

461
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:33,600
So I don't have an agent right now,
but I can do accents.

462
00:37:33,900 --> 00:37:38,000
I do English, I do Jamaican
and even Texas.

463
00:37:38,300 --> 00:37:41,900
- And I even play the piano and tennis.
- Yeah, she real good, dude.

464
00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:44,600
Silk got this script
that's off the hook, man.

465
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,800
I got the script with Oscar
shit written all over it.

466
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,000
- I'll tell you what it's called.
- Tell him.

467
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:53,600
Tell him the title. You will love
this title. Tell him the title.

468
00:37:53,900 --> 00:37:55,700
- Let me hear it.
- You ready for this?

469
00:37:56,100 --> 00:37:58,100
- It's called...
- Listen to this.

470
00:37:58,300 --> 00:37:59,600
..."Nasty."

471
00:38:01,500 --> 00:38:03,700
- Tell me that ain't hot!
- That's a good title.

472
00:38:04,100 --> 00:38:05,800
I'm into titties and shit blowing up.

473
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,200
- But nothing exploitive.
- No, none of that.

474
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:10,100
- Gotta respect the female.
- Always.

475
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:14,600
Maybe I can help you out with this,
but you guys can help me out too.

476
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:19,100
Give me a call if you hear anything
about this H2OKlick thing, all right?

477
00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:23,300
We ain't no snitches or nothing
like that, you know. Come on, now.

478
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:25,800
- No, I don't wanna ask you to do that.
- No.

479
00:38:25,900 --> 00:38:30,100
You hold on to that just in case
something comes up. You never know.

480
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:33,000
How much time you spend
in the joint, Antoine?

481
00:38:33,100 --> 00:38:35,500
Much too long for my taste.

482
00:38:37,700 --> 00:38:40,000
My accountant let me down.

483
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:42,400
Something about
commingling of funds.

484
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:45,200
Yeah, it could happen to anybody.

485
00:38:47,300 --> 00:38:51,800
Must take a lot of money to get
one of these groups up and running.

486
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:56,000
How much did you have
invested in Klepto?

487
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,400
Now, that was a bad investment.

488
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:04,300
He left my label. Why you asking?

489
00:39:06,100 --> 00:39:09,100
I'm just fascinated
by the music business.

490
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:19,400
One last thing. Young fellow goes
by the name of K-Ro.

491
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:22,000
Did some songs for H2O.

492
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:24,400
Know his real name
or where I can find him?

493
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:27,700
- I'd like to ask him a few questions.
- K-Ro.

494
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:32,100
No, I don't... I don't even know
the guy's real name.

495
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:35,800
I mean, most of these kids
have some badass names.

496
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:37,900
They all think they're thugs.

497
00:39:38,100 --> 00:39:40,600
For most, it's just an act.
Bunch of mama's boys.

498
00:39:40,900 --> 00:39:44,400
First they're down with a brother,
then they're ungrateful asses.

499
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:48,000
Half of them would be dead
or in prison if it wasn't for me.

500
00:39:48,700 --> 00:39:53,200
You know what I'm saying, detective?
It's just a game. Nothing but a game.

501
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:57,200
Well, we got four mama's boys
laying on slabs at the morgue.

502
00:39:59,900 --> 00:40:01,300
It wasn't a game last night.

503
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:06,800
I'll let you go. Thanks for your help.
If you think of anything more...

504
00:40:07,700 --> 00:40:10,500
...you let me know, okay?
- Sure.

505
00:40:13,600 --> 00:40:15,000
Detective.

506
00:40:16,500 --> 00:40:19,100
What, are you trying to sell me
some real estate?

507
00:40:58,100 --> 00:41:01,000
- What do you got?
- I know Sartain's lying to me.

508
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:03,800
- How do you know that?
- His lips are moving.

509
00:41:04,100 --> 00:41:07,100
- What do you got there?
- It's a script from the guys in there.

510
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:09,800
They say they'll call if they
come across anything.

511
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:13,400
They say they don't know about
last night. They're lying too.

512
00:41:13,700 --> 00:41:16,300
You get the name of that
producer selling his house?

513
00:41:16,500 --> 00:41:18,600
- I'll get it now. Just a second.
- All right.

514
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:26,600
Mimi?

515
00:41:27,500 --> 00:41:30,100
Mona, right. Sorry.

516
00:41:30,500 --> 00:41:33,600
Do you know the name of that
producer selling his place up on...?

517
00:41:33,900 --> 00:41:35,300
Yeah.

518
00:41:36,900 --> 00:41:39,500
Thank you. Yeah, sorry. Bye.

519
00:41:41,300 --> 00:41:45,500
- Jerry Duran?
- Jerry Duran. Used to be huge.

520
00:41:46,500 --> 00:41:49,600
- Joe, somebody's stealing your car!
- It's insured, so it's okay.

521
00:41:49,900 --> 00:41:51,800
No, it's not okay!

522
00:41:54,200 --> 00:41:56,500
Hey! Get out of the way!
Get out of the way!

523
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:01,400
Stop! Police!

524
00:42:01,600 --> 00:42:03,200
Stop!

525
00:42:06,300 --> 00:42:07,500
All right!

526
00:42:17,500 --> 00:42:19,600
Get out of the car!
Get your hands up!

527
00:42:19,900 --> 00:42:22,800
Stop! Get down! Get down!

528
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:25,800
Get down on the ground!
Get down!

529
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:29,000
Put your hands where I can see them.
Get them behind your back.

530
00:42:29,300 --> 00:42:31,500
Don't cuff us.
We weren't stealing your car.

531
00:42:31,900 --> 00:42:34,500
- We're repo guys.
- You kidding me?

532
00:42:36,600 --> 00:42:37,800
Nice shot, slick.

533
00:42:38,100 --> 00:42:40,800
Now we gotta spend the afternoon
booking car thieves...

534
00:42:40,900 --> 00:42:43,000
...filling out paperwork.

535
00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:45,800
- They weren't stealing it.
- What do you call it?

536
00:42:46,500 --> 00:42:48,000
Repo.

537
00:42:48,200 --> 00:42:50,800
Apparently, you're behind
on your payments.

538
00:42:53,900 --> 00:42:58,400
You assholes, get out of here!
Get out of here! Goddamn it! Get out!

539
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:05,800
Shit! That was a good tire!

540
00:43:07,300 --> 00:43:10,300
Hey, Roy. Joe Gavilan just left.

541
00:43:11,600 --> 00:43:13,100
He was in here looking for K-Ro.

542
00:43:13,400 --> 00:43:15,300
He must've been
the other guy backstage.

543
00:43:15,500 --> 00:43:17,000
'Toine, listen to me.

544
00:43:17,400 --> 00:43:20,000
- It's taken care of.
- No, no, it's not taken care of.

545
00:43:20,300 --> 00:43:22,500
If it was, Gavilan wouldn't
be here in my face.

546
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:25,300
After tonight, K-Ro's just a memory.

547
00:43:25,600 --> 00:43:28,200
Not after tonight. Take care of it now.

548
00:43:28,500 --> 00:43:33,400
- By the time homicide finds him...
- Get it taken care of. Now!

549
00:43:51,700 --> 00:43:53,000
K.C.!

550
00:43:54,200 --> 00:43:57,000
- Kimberly, hey!
- Shawna!

551
00:44:01,100 --> 00:44:03,700
You dog, you.

552
00:44:05,500 --> 00:44:08,600
- Yes?
- L.A.P.D. Mr. Duran, please.

553
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:10,300
One moment, please.

554
00:44:13,700 --> 00:44:17,400
You just shut up and let me
do the talking, all right?

555
00:44:20,600 --> 00:44:23,500
- Gentlemen.
- Mr. Duran. Hollywood Homicide.

556
00:44:23,800 --> 00:44:27,200
Detective Joe Gavilan.
My partner, K.C. Calden.

557
00:44:27,500 --> 00:44:31,800
- There must be some mistake.
- I think I've got a buyer for your house.

558
00:44:32,100 --> 00:44:34,800
- I won't go a penny under 5.7.
- I was thinking 6.

559
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:39,700
- So that's, what, five bedrooms?
- Six bedrooms upstairs, six baths.

560
00:44:40,100 --> 00:44:42,800
Guesthouse has two baths,
two bedrooms.

561
00:44:43,100 --> 00:44:46,000
And in the servants' quarters,
two bedrooms, two baths.

562
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:51,300
Now, this room's a beaut. You got
a whole view of Benedict Canyon. It's...

563
00:44:51,600 --> 00:44:54,200
Hey, don't you have something
to do in the kitchen?

564
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:57,100
There's a lost wax fountain
at the bottom of this.

565
00:44:57,400 --> 00:44:59,500
It's a piece of work.
You should see that.

566
00:44:59,600 --> 00:45:01,700
And this is a living room.

567
00:45:07,900 --> 00:45:10,200
Mr. Duran, are you still
making music and movies?

568
00:45:10,600 --> 00:45:12,500
When I can, kid.

569
00:45:12,900 --> 00:45:14,800
Well...

570
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:19,000
...what are you doing on Friday night?
- Friday night's a long time away, kid.

571
00:45:19,400 --> 00:45:22,700
- Beautiful house, Mr. Duran.
- Thank you.

572
00:45:23,100 --> 00:45:24,800
I've got a desperate buyer.

573
00:45:25,100 --> 00:45:27,100
Give me a three-day exclusive listing.

574
00:45:27,300 --> 00:45:31,200
- If I don't sell it in that time, deal's off.
- I'll give you 48 hours.

575
00:45:33,700 --> 00:45:37,000
The great and the near-great.

576
00:45:39,600 --> 00:45:41,800
I used to be huge.

577
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:46,600
- I could be huge again.
- You're still huge to me, Mr. Duran.

578
00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:51,100
You got 72 hours to sell my house.

579
00:45:52,300 --> 00:45:55,200
- Thank you.
- Let me show you the door.

580
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:10,500
Joe Gavilan. Look, I found you
your big house with class.

581
00:46:10,900 --> 00:46:13,400
But you got to get over here
right away.

582
00:46:13,600 --> 00:46:15,400
- There's a lot of interest.
- "What's up?"

583
00:46:15,700 --> 00:46:18,400
I got $6 million. You been talking.
Show me the house.

584
00:46:18,800 --> 00:46:22,700
3500 Shadow Hills Way, Beverly Hills.

585
00:46:23,600 --> 00:46:28,100
How soon...? Within an hour?
Okay, great.

586
00:46:30,100 --> 00:46:31,900
Gavilan. Yeah, Leon.

587
00:46:32,100 --> 00:46:34,200
Mando's got something for you.
Hold on.

588
00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:36,200
Joe, the kid who split the club.

589
00:46:36,500 --> 00:46:40,500
K- Ro, born Oliver Robidoux, 5/78.
Went to Leuzinger High...

590
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:42,300
...in Compton, graduated '95.

591
00:46:42,500 --> 00:46:44,600
- "Address unknown."
- Oliver Robidoux.

592
00:46:44,900 --> 00:46:48,200
- I hope they do haul you in...
- Leon, that name ring a bell with you?

593
00:46:48,500 --> 00:46:52,500
- Robidoux, Robidoux. Sounds familiar.
- Yeah, a Motown singer.

594
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:57,600
Olivia Robidoux used to sing backup
for Marvin Gaye and Tammi Terrell.

595
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:00,200
- Stella!
- Put Lopez back on.

596
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:03,800
Run Olivia Robidoux, will you?
Music unions, ASCAP, anything.

597
00:47:04,200 --> 00:47:06,800
- Get back to me, okay?
- I hope they do haul you in...

598
00:47:07,100 --> 00:47:09,100
- K-Ro.
...and turn the fire hose on you.

599
00:47:09,400 --> 00:47:15,400
- You whelp of a Polack, you.
- Hey. K-Ro is one Oliver Robidoux.

600
00:47:15,800 --> 00:47:20,600
I think his mom was this backup
singer for Motown, Olivia Robidoux.

601
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:23,200
- We're finally getting somewhere.
- Let's go.

602
00:47:23,400 --> 00:47:26,500
Hey, look, I gotta show the house.

603
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:31,800
- Now?
- How about you cover the autopsies?

604
00:47:34,200 --> 00:47:37,000
- I don't like dead bodies.
- Come on, I'll owe you one.

605
00:47:38,600 --> 00:47:43,200
- You coming to my play Friday night?
- Yeah, I'm coming to your play. Sure.

606
00:47:43,600 --> 00:47:45,500
Well, there's still some seats open.

607
00:47:47,500 --> 00:47:50,400
All right, I'll bring some people, okay?

608
00:47:51,800 --> 00:47:53,100
All right, you got a deal.

609
00:47:53,300 --> 00:47:55,200
- Shawna, can I get a lift?
- Of course.

610
00:47:55,900 --> 00:47:57,500
Cool. See you, Joe.

611
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:01,100
Let me take that for you.
Thanks.

612
00:48:01,600 --> 00:48:03,500
It's good to see you again.

613
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:07,400
Man.

614
00:48:14,100 --> 00:48:15,300
- Jesus!
- Sorry about that.

615
00:48:15,500 --> 00:48:19,100
There's some towels over there, K.C.
We got a juicy one here.

616
00:48:33,600 --> 00:48:38,700
- K.C. Calden, Hollywood Homicide.
- Willie Palmero, South Bureau.

617
00:48:39,100 --> 00:48:41,100
Body drop in Vernon.

618
00:48:41,800 --> 00:48:43,500
Couple of crispy critters here.

619
00:48:43,800 --> 00:48:46,900
I think it was a professional hit,
a straight-up execution.

620
00:48:48,900 --> 00:48:52,100
- And this earring?
- Off one of the guys.

621
00:48:53,600 --> 00:48:57,900
I bet they were wearing work boots,
weren't they? Sizes 9 and 11?

622
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:04,400
- How'd you know?
- Jesus Christ.

623
00:49:05,600 --> 00:49:08,800
Willie, I think these guys
shot those guys.

624
00:49:12,800 --> 00:49:15,500
Beautiful home. Cool crib.

625
00:49:15,900 --> 00:49:17,600
This is me.

626
00:49:17,800 --> 00:49:20,500
The great, near-great
used to hang out here.

627
00:49:20,800 --> 00:49:22,200
For sure?

628
00:49:22,800 --> 00:49:24,200
Wow.

629
00:49:25,300 --> 00:49:27,900
- He wants 7.
- Man, tell him kiss my ass.

630
00:49:28,500 --> 00:49:31,300
No, now wait.
Here's the deal.

631
00:49:31,600 --> 00:49:35,600
You offer 5.5. He counters with 6.5.

632
00:49:35,900 --> 00:49:39,200
You come back at 6.
Give him 48 hours. He'll take it.

633
00:49:39,600 --> 00:49:41,700
- He's desperate.
- For sure?

634
00:49:42,200 --> 00:49:44,900
For sure. Excuse me.

635
00:49:45,600 --> 00:49:47,400
- Gavilan.
- "Joe, yeah."

636
00:49:47,600 --> 00:49:50,900
I got two bodies here in the chop
shop that could be the triggermen.

637
00:49:51,300 --> 00:49:53,600
- What do you got?
- I got the earring...

638
00:49:53,800 --> 00:49:56,000
...and the boots. I booked them
into evidence.

639
00:49:56,400 --> 00:49:58,900
- Man, what's up?
- Police business.

640
00:49:59,200 --> 00:50:03,100
- You seen the library?
- I don't need no library. I need a pool.

641
00:50:03,400 --> 00:50:06,100
Turf-warfare guys do
their own dirty work.

642
00:50:06,300 --> 00:50:09,400
I think these guys were capped
to cover somebody else's tracks.

643
00:50:09,500 --> 00:50:11,300
- You like tennis?
- Too much running.

644
00:50:11,700 --> 00:50:15,700
I absolutely agree with you.
No, not...

645
00:50:15,900 --> 00:50:18,000
Look, good job, kid.
I'll talk to you later.

646
00:50:18,400 --> 00:50:20,400
Yeah, okay.

647
00:50:24,300 --> 00:50:26,400
So, Julius...

648
00:50:26,700 --> 00:50:31,700
...what do you think?
- Okay. I'll go 5.5.

649
00:50:32,100 --> 00:50:35,000
All right. My man.

650
00:50:39,300 --> 00:50:41,300
Bring the left foot back.

651
00:50:43,600 --> 00:50:46,700
Root it there and come up
into warrior one.

652
00:50:47,200 --> 00:50:50,100
Let your arms just raise up.

653
00:50:51,500 --> 00:50:55,500
Spread your arms to the sides. Exhale.
Come back down into warrior two.

654
00:50:55,800 --> 00:51:01,400
Exhale. Bring your right arm down
to your knee and then sweep across.

655
00:51:02,100 --> 00:51:04,700
Extreme right-angle pose.

656
00:51:06,200 --> 00:51:09,500
Sweep the arms up,
move your feet to parallel.

657
00:51:09,800 --> 00:51:13,100
Pull your arms back around
behind you.

658
00:51:18,200 --> 00:51:20,600
And then just feel yourself open.

659
00:51:22,700 --> 00:51:23,900
Very good.

660
00:51:27,100 --> 00:51:29,600
Continue that on the other side.
I'll be right back.

661
00:51:29,800 --> 00:51:32,700
- What are you doing here?
- I've got something for you.

662
00:51:33,100 --> 00:51:35,100
- How'd you find me?
- I'm psychic.

663
00:51:36,100 --> 00:51:38,100
- Really?
- No, not really.

664
00:51:38,300 --> 00:51:40,600
I'm a detective, for chrissake.

665
00:51:40,800 --> 00:51:42,300
I didn't know you taught this.

666
00:51:42,500 --> 00:51:45,000
- You make some dough?
- Yeah, I make 20 bucks a head.

667
00:51:45,400 --> 00:51:48,400
- You know, donation.
- Donation? Unreportable?

668
00:51:48,700 --> 00:51:52,400
Twenty times 40...
Eight hundred bucks a whack?

669
00:51:53,300 --> 00:51:54,700
Cash?

670
00:51:54,900 --> 00:51:58,900
Class, all right, when you're done
with this pose, we're done for the day.

671
00:52:00,700 --> 00:52:02,400
Get back here.

672
00:52:03,200 --> 00:52:06,500
Some racket you got here.
Money and sex.

673
00:52:06,900 --> 00:52:10,000
This is not a racket. These are real
people with real feelings.

674
00:52:10,400 --> 00:52:12,900
They need me. I'm their teacher.
And I need them too.

675
00:52:13,100 --> 00:52:17,300
It's called a symbiotic relationship.
You wouldn't know about that.

676
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:19,500
Have a good day. Nice practice.

677
00:52:19,700 --> 00:52:23,200
Excuse me, K.C.,
do you give private lessons?

678
00:52:23,700 --> 00:52:26,700
I don't. If you talk to Kimberly,
then we'll set something up.

679
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:27,900
Okay, thank you.

680
00:52:28,100 --> 00:52:30,800
K.C., thank you. I feel really...

681
00:52:31,800 --> 00:52:33,000
...open.

682
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:36,900
That's a good thing, okay?

683
00:52:37,300 --> 00:52:38,700
See you later.

684
00:52:41,800 --> 00:52:43,000
Great class.

685
00:52:45,200 --> 00:52:46,700
Thanks, Shawna.

686
00:52:51,500 --> 00:52:53,300
Okay.

687
00:52:53,500 --> 00:52:55,400
Maybe I got into it for the sex.

688
00:52:55,600 --> 00:53:00,100
But it's not about that anymore.
I mean, this spiritual shit...

689
00:53:00,600 --> 00:53:02,400
...there's really something to it.

690
00:53:02,500 --> 00:53:05,300
I mean,
I'm out of my body sometimes, man.

691
00:53:05,700 --> 00:53:06,700
Seriously.

692
00:53:06,800 --> 00:53:08,400
I mean, this stuff really works.

693
00:53:08,700 --> 00:53:12,500
And then these girls come in.
And, I mean, they're everywhere.

694
00:53:14,900 --> 00:53:16,800
It's spiritual.

695
00:53:18,200 --> 00:53:20,900
- Deep.
- And shallow.

696
00:53:21,500 --> 00:53:23,000
Deep and shallow.

697
00:53:23,300 --> 00:53:26,900
This is why I came.
It's the report on your dad's shooting.

698
00:53:28,700 --> 00:53:30,200
Gavilan.

699
00:53:30,400 --> 00:53:32,600
Gower and Franklin.

700
00:53:32,900 --> 00:53:35,200
Thanks for understanding, Joe.

701
00:53:39,700 --> 00:53:41,000
What's up, Cleo?

702
00:53:41,200 --> 00:53:43,100
- Have you talked to Vice?
- No, I haven't.

703
00:53:43,400 --> 00:53:45,900
Not gonna talk to Vice
till I talk to your girl.

704
00:53:46,100 --> 00:53:50,000
- You'll have to give me a name.
- My girl is ready to talk.

705
00:53:50,900 --> 00:53:52,300
I've heard that before.

706
00:53:52,600 --> 00:53:55,000
She says she was working
a Sartain Records party.

707
00:53:55,200 --> 00:53:57,600
Overheard some guy smoking crack
start bragging.

708
00:53:57,900 --> 00:53:59,600
About what?

709
00:54:01,100 --> 00:54:04,700
The people behind the Klepto murder
were also behind the H2OKlick hit.

710
00:54:05,100 --> 00:54:06,100
That's hearsay.

711
00:54:06,400 --> 00:54:09,700
Hearsay to you,
pillow talk to the DA.

712
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:12,700
- You want a deal?
- I don't know.

713
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:15,300
Give me a call tomorrow,
I'll run it by the DA.

714
00:54:16,500 --> 00:54:20,500
- This girl better be for real.
- Look, I gotta make this work.

715
00:54:20,900 --> 00:54:22,700
Things are getting ugly.

716
00:54:22,900 --> 00:54:24,700
I hear you.

717
00:54:29,100 --> 00:54:31,300
What we got on Gavilan so far?

718
00:54:31,800 --> 00:54:34,000
First of all,
he's still seeing Cleo Ricard.

719
00:54:34,200 --> 00:54:37,300
- In fact, he saw her earlier today.
- God, it's right in my face.

720
00:54:37,700 --> 00:54:39,200
He's just completely defiant.

721
00:54:39,300 --> 00:54:41,800
He's clearly continuing to work her
as an informant.

722
00:54:42,100 --> 00:54:44,600
That's enough to relieve him
of duty right there.

723
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:47,700
I don't want him relieved of duty.
I want him to hang.

724
00:54:47,900 --> 00:54:49,500
His financials don't add up.

725
00:54:49,700 --> 00:54:52,100
He's paying off three ex-wives.
He's got two kids.

726
00:54:52,500 --> 00:54:56,400
Two kids in a fancy college. He's got a
great big house and a big, stupid car.

727
00:54:56,600 --> 00:54:58,900
I mean,
what about his real-estate thing?

728
00:54:59,100 --> 00:55:00,600
He hasn't made a sale in ages.

729
00:55:00,900 --> 00:55:04,500
My source tells me he's getting money
from somewhere to keep it afloat.

730
00:55:04,900 --> 00:55:07,300
- So get me more surveillance.
- Okay.

731
00:55:07,600 --> 00:55:08,700
Alrighty.

732
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:48,000
- Dominique?
- Close enough.

733
00:56:39,300 --> 00:56:43,000
- Where'd you get the key?
- Under the flowerpot.

734
00:56:52,900 --> 00:56:54,900
How'd you know it was
under the flowerpot?

735
00:56:55,100 --> 00:56:56,800
I'm psychic.

736
00:56:57,600 --> 00:56:59,900
Good security for a cop.

737
00:57:50,600 --> 00:57:52,300
Bad cop.

738
00:57:52,500 --> 00:57:54,700
No doughnut.

739
00:58:34,100 --> 00:58:37,000
- Everything okay?
- Oh, yeah.

740
00:58:38,400 --> 00:58:39,800
Everything's fine.

741
00:58:42,300 --> 00:58:44,700
Just a tough case, that's all.

742
00:58:47,100 --> 00:58:50,700
Used to have a feel
for a case early on.

743
00:58:55,600 --> 00:58:57,100
Thank you.

744
00:58:58,800 --> 00:59:00,600
So you really...

745
00:59:02,200 --> 00:59:04,800
...think you can
predict the future, huh?

746
00:59:05,500 --> 00:59:07,400
How's that work?

747
00:59:07,600 --> 00:59:12,200
Sometimes I see things.
It just comes to me.

748
00:59:12,500 --> 00:59:14,400
And sometimes I flip a coin.

749
00:59:15,700 --> 00:59:17,700
Other times...

750
00:59:19,500 --> 00:59:21,800
...I just make shit up.

751
00:59:23,900 --> 00:59:26,100
Happy anniversary.

752
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:29,000
What anniversary?

753
00:59:29,800 --> 00:59:31,400
You and me.

754
00:59:32,400 --> 00:59:34,000
Three weeks.

755
00:59:34,100 --> 00:59:35,700
That is so sweet.

756
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:38,000
You remembered.

757
00:59:38,400 --> 00:59:40,200
I didn't.

758
00:59:40,400 --> 00:59:43,400
I mean, dates don't really matter,
except they do.

759
00:59:43,600 --> 00:59:46,800
We think human time,
but rocks think geologic time.

760
00:59:47,200 --> 00:59:49,600
Do you understand what I'm saying?

761
00:59:49,800 --> 00:59:51,600
I don't.

762
00:59:52,900 --> 00:59:58,300
The only date that matters is the day
I found you and left that jerk.

763
01:00:00,700 --> 01:00:02,200
Does he know it's over?

764
01:00:02,600 --> 01:00:04,300
Bennie's in denial.

765
01:00:04,600 --> 01:00:08,900
He's hanging on like a mongoose.
It's sad, really.

766
01:00:10,300 --> 01:00:11,200
Bennie?

767
01:00:11,500 --> 01:00:14,400
Macko. You don't know him.
He's not in your division.

768
01:00:14,700 --> 01:00:16,700
Bennie Macko?

769
01:00:17,600 --> 01:00:21,300
- Bennie "The Executioner" Macko?
- That sounds like my Bennie.

770
01:00:21,500 --> 01:00:24,200
He's the guy who's trying to bury me,
for chrissake!

771
01:00:24,600 --> 01:00:26,900
- Does he know about us?
- Of course not.

772
01:00:27,100 --> 01:00:29,000
And who cares?
It's over, we're finished.

773
01:00:29,300 --> 01:00:33,700
Guys aren't like that, honey.
Guys keep score!

774
01:00:36,700 --> 01:00:38,200
Gavilan.

775
01:00:38,500 --> 01:00:40,100
Yeah, Jerry...

776
01:00:40,700 --> 01:00:42,600
Mr. Duran.

777
01:00:45,300 --> 01:00:48,200
Yeah, I can do that.

778
01:00:48,800 --> 01:00:50,400
Okay.

779
01:00:55,400 --> 01:00:58,600
Get the buyer and the seller
inches away from closing...

780
01:00:58,900 --> 01:01:00,800
...and this guy wants...

781
01:01:01,300 --> 01:01:02,200
...breakfast.

782
01:01:02,400 --> 01:01:06,300
That could be great, honey. Mercury's
not in retrograde for another week.

783
01:01:06,600 --> 01:01:10,700
It's good time for deal-making.
It's perfect time.

784
01:01:13,500 --> 01:01:15,700
What did you ever see in...

785
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:17,400
...Bennie Macko?

786
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:21,700
I guess I just have
a weakness for cops.

787
01:01:25,200 --> 01:01:26,600
Lock up when you leave.

788
01:01:36,600 --> 01:01:38,500
What have we here?

789
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:40,300
Oh, my!

790
01:01:44,500 --> 01:01:45,700
Nice shoes.

791
01:01:51,700 --> 01:01:54,700
- Good morning, Mr. Duran, Julius.
- Good morning. Have a seat.

792
01:01:55,300 --> 01:01:57,300
This is my attorney, Marty Wheeler...

793
01:01:57,600 --> 01:02:01,500
...who just happens to be Julius'
attorney as well. Small world.

794
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:04,500
A conflict of interest?

795
01:02:04,800 --> 01:02:06,500
Not for me.

796
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:08,200
Okay, let's talk.

797
01:02:08,400 --> 01:02:11,500
Julius was ready
to go to 6.3 or 6.4...

798
01:02:11,800 --> 01:02:13,700
...and you drove the price down
to 6.

799
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:16,700
Wait a second. You wanted 5.8.
Six is a score.

800
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:20,300
- You never told me 5.8 would do it.
- I was negotiating.

801
01:02:20,700 --> 01:02:22,000
For whom?

802
01:02:22,200 --> 01:02:24,500
Look, you wanted 5.8.
I was about to get you 6.

803
01:02:24,900 --> 01:02:28,200
- He was ready to go to 6.4.
- Maybe 6.5.

804
01:02:28,400 --> 01:02:30,700
But you said the price was 7.
It never was.

805
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:33,900
Look, guys, calm down.
This is a good deal for both of you.

806
01:02:34,100 --> 01:02:36,600
The deal's off. I want 7 million.

807
01:02:37,500 --> 01:02:38,600
Seven?

808
01:02:39,600 --> 01:02:41,300
- Seven?
- Yeah.

809
01:02:41,500 --> 01:02:43,900
I won't go a penny over 6.5.

810
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:47,900
Good day, gents.

811
01:02:48,200 --> 01:02:49,900
Asshole!

812
01:02:57,500 --> 01:03:01,200
I was that close to closing the deal
when Duran starts dicking around...

813
01:03:01,500 --> 01:03:03,000
...and blows the whole thing.

814
01:03:03,200 --> 01:03:05,200
Getting excited never
solved any problems.

815
01:03:05,500 --> 01:03:09,500
How many girls are waiting in line for
the hot tub? That's a problem for you.

816
01:03:09,900 --> 01:03:13,100
Joe, you don't respect me wanting
to be an actor, do you?

817
01:03:14,300 --> 01:03:15,700
I just don't get it.

818
01:03:15,900 --> 01:03:19,200
Don't you ever want to explore
all the possibilities of who you are?

819
01:03:19,700 --> 01:03:23,400
I just want to pay the mortgage and
escape with my dick attached to me.

820
01:03:23,700 --> 01:03:26,600
It's that one over there.
I'm a simple man. Go around behind.

821
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:28,700
- I'll give you a second.
- Okay.

822
01:03:28,900 --> 01:03:30,600
Take the front.

823
01:03:50,200 --> 01:03:52,900
Ms. Robidoux? Police!

824
01:03:53,300 --> 01:03:56,100
Just want to ask you a few questions.

825
01:03:59,100 --> 01:04:01,700
I always thought you could sing
better than Tammi Terrell.

826
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:05,200
She got the breaks. I didn't.
That's life.

827
01:04:05,600 --> 01:04:07,200
Mind if I come in?

828
01:04:15,800 --> 01:04:16,800
Jesus Christ.

829
01:04:17,800 --> 01:04:20,500
Joe, he's around front!
Joe, he's coming around front!

830
01:04:23,100 --> 01:04:24,700
I got him!

831
01:04:26,600 --> 01:04:28,200
He didn't do anything!

832
01:04:28,500 --> 01:04:30,700
Ms. Robidoux.

833
01:04:40,900 --> 01:04:42,400
Hey!

834
01:04:44,300 --> 01:04:45,500
I ain't did shit, cop!

835
01:04:45,700 --> 01:04:49,100
Why you come to my mama house?
I ain't been to your mama house!

836
01:04:56,200 --> 01:04:57,600
Fuck!

837
01:05:02,300 --> 01:05:04,500
Jesus Christ, man!

838
01:05:04,900 --> 01:05:06,300
- Get out of the water!
- Wait.

839
01:05:06,500 --> 01:05:09,300
- Don't make me come in.
- I'm knee-deep in duck shit.

840
01:05:09,500 --> 01:05:11,700
- There's two feet of duck shit.
- That's fine.

841
01:05:12,100 --> 01:05:14,500
- Get out of the water!
- What you gonna do, shoot me?

842
01:05:15,300 --> 01:05:17,400
He wants to shoot an unarmed nigger.

843
01:05:17,700 --> 01:05:20,900
- Get out, man. You're under arrest.
- I didn't do nothing!

844
01:05:21,100 --> 01:05:22,800
Get out of the water!

845
01:05:58,000 --> 01:05:59,400
Fuck.

846
01:06:02,600 --> 01:06:04,000
Hey!

847
01:06:14,100 --> 01:06:15,900
Too slow, cop!

848
01:06:16,400 --> 01:06:17,800
Hey!

849
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:20,500
Christ!

850
01:06:20,800 --> 01:06:23,700
Right or left?
Pick a way, I'm gonna catch you.

851
01:06:26,900 --> 01:06:28,700
Never gonna catch me, cop!

852
01:06:28,900 --> 01:06:31,000
Gotcha, gotcha, gotcha.

853
01:06:40,800 --> 01:06:43,900
Stay right! Stay... Sorry,
your right! Your right, please!

854
01:06:47,600 --> 01:06:48,700
All right!

855
01:06:48,900 --> 01:06:50,200
Police brutality!

856
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:53,600
Don't swear!
It's not nice.

857
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:55,500
Settle down!

858
01:06:56,200 --> 01:06:58,000
You got him.
See where that got you!

859
01:06:59,200 --> 01:07:02,800
You're still caught and you got shit
all over you! How do you like that?

860
01:07:03,300 --> 01:07:05,400
- Center yourself.
- I'm calm, okay?

861
01:07:05,700 --> 01:07:07,100
- All right.
- I'm calm!

862
01:07:07,400 --> 01:07:09,200
Get up!

863
01:07:09,700 --> 01:07:11,300
You young-ass brat.

864
01:07:11,600 --> 01:07:14,700
If it wasn't for this old man,
you wouldn't have caught nothing!

865
01:07:14,900 --> 01:07:18,600
Even if you had roller skates. I can't
believe I let your old ass catch me.

866
01:07:18,900 --> 01:07:20,800
- Talk to us.
- L.A.P.D:

867
01:07:21,100 --> 01:07:24,500
- Lame-ass, punk-ass dickheads.
- Settle down, son.

868
01:07:24,700 --> 01:07:26,700
- L.A.P.D.
- Settle down.

869
01:07:26,900 --> 01:07:30,900
I ain't no snitch and I ain't no bitch.
I ain't got to tell you shit.

870
01:07:31,400 --> 01:07:33,700
You are just talking yourself
into a hole.

871
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:36,400
- Take my cuffs off. I'll kick your ass!
- Really...?

872
01:07:36,600 --> 01:07:39,800
Will you shut up? Shut up!

873
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:41,400
I ain't did shit, man.

874
01:07:41,600 --> 01:07:44,200
All right, that's it! That's it!

875
01:07:44,400 --> 01:07:47,300
Let's take this sucker
to the station, partner, huh?

876
01:07:47,500 --> 01:07:48,900
Harbor Division Substation.

877
01:07:49,900 --> 01:07:50,900
Crooked-ass police.

878
01:07:51,100 --> 01:07:54,500
I'm gonna call Johnnie Cochran,
Chemical Ali, Robert Shapiro.

879
01:07:54,800 --> 01:07:56,600
One of them.
Wait till I call my mama.

880
01:07:56,900 --> 01:08:00,200
It's gonna be whack, man...
What is this, man?

881
01:08:00,700 --> 01:08:02,500
This is Harbor Division, son.

882
01:08:02,800 --> 01:08:06,200
Nice, quiet place.
We can reason together.

883
01:08:08,900 --> 01:08:10,400
Here we are.

884
01:08:11,600 --> 01:08:13,500
Harbor Division.

885
01:08:13,800 --> 01:08:16,000
This don't look like
no police station.

886
01:08:16,300 --> 01:08:18,300
- Get him out of the car!
- My pleasure.

887
01:08:19,100 --> 01:08:21,000
- Get him out.
- This don't look like no...

888
01:08:21,300 --> 01:08:23,100
- Get out.
- This ain't no police station.

889
01:08:23,400 --> 01:08:28,200
Yeah, this is a special station
for special assholes.

890
01:08:51,100 --> 01:08:52,500
Hey! Not again.

891
01:08:53,900 --> 01:08:55,500
- Come back here. Come on.
- Goddamn!

892
01:08:55,800 --> 01:08:56,700
You okay?

893
01:08:57,200 --> 01:08:58,400
Yeah, I'm okay. You?

894
01:08:58,700 --> 01:08:59,800
Okay.

895
01:09:00,100 --> 01:09:01,400
Any opportunity, right?

896
01:09:01,700 --> 01:09:05,200
Somebody doesn't like you.
You're no fun to be around!

897
01:09:05,400 --> 01:09:07,800
- You all right?
- Somebody wants you dead.

898
01:09:08,100 --> 01:09:10,500
- He okay?
- He's okay, he just pissed his pants.

899
01:09:10,800 --> 01:09:13,400
- I wanna talk to my mama.
- You're the man.

900
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:15,600
You got nothing on my boy.

901
01:09:15,700 --> 01:09:18,200
We've got a puddle of piss
at the crime scene...

902
01:09:18,400 --> 01:09:21,600
...and your son has a weak bladder.
- And what does that mean?

903
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:26,000
That means we take your son to the
station, we ask him what he saw.

904
01:09:26,400 --> 01:09:30,000
He answers,
we book him into custody, he lives.

905
01:09:30,200 --> 01:09:32,600
He doesn't, we let him go, he dies!

906
01:09:32,800 --> 01:09:35,400
He didn't do it.
And he ain't getting involved.

907
01:09:35,700 --> 01:09:38,700
All right, uncuff him.
Let the jackals hunt him down.

908
01:09:39,100 --> 01:09:41,500
- Man, what I'm talking about...
- Hey, stop, stop.

909
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:43,400
Stop.

910
01:09:47,300 --> 01:09:49,100
The young men that got shot...

911
01:09:49,300 --> 01:09:53,600
...all were rappers since they were
little boys on the street corner.

912
01:09:54,300 --> 01:09:58,400
And they all wanted to be with
Antoine Sartain and Sartain Records.

913
01:09:58,700 --> 01:10:00,600
That was their Motown.

914
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:03,900
- I don't get the music.
- You ain't supposed to.

915
01:10:04,400 --> 01:10:06,900
After a few albums,
they want to go out on their own.

916
01:10:07,200 --> 01:10:09,700
They find out the producer's
keeping all the money.

917
01:10:09,900 --> 01:10:12,500
The way it's always gonna be
in the music business.

918
01:10:12,800 --> 01:10:14,900
Sartain goes to the joint
for a while.

919
01:10:15,500 --> 01:10:19,200
Klepto, the first to rebel,
tells Sartain:

920
01:10:19,400 --> 01:10:20,700
"I'm gonna hire a lawyer...

921
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:23,600
...to get out of my contract
I signed in high school."

922
01:10:24,200 --> 01:10:25,800
Sartain get out of jail.

923
01:10:28,900 --> 01:10:31,000
You know what happened next.

924
01:10:38,900 --> 01:10:41,400
You telling me Sartain
had his own groups killed...

925
01:10:41,700 --> 01:10:43,700
...because they wanted
to go on their own?

926
01:10:44,300 --> 01:10:45,700
Makes a powerful statement...

927
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:48,700
...to anybody thinking
about breaking a contract.

928
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:50,400
Don't it?

929
01:10:53,900 --> 01:10:55,700
I told you what the picture
looks like.

930
01:10:56,200 --> 01:10:59,000
You have to put the pieces together
your own self.

931
01:11:00,100 --> 01:11:02,800
We'll take care of your son
for you, ma'am.

932
01:11:05,800 --> 01:11:09,200
Antoine Sartain. He was a busy guy
in the gangster network.

933
01:11:09,600 --> 01:11:12,400
Had a lot of contacts on the outside.
The music guy, right?

934
01:11:12,700 --> 01:11:13,700
Big time.

935
01:11:13,900 --> 01:11:16,200
He was smooth,
but he was a psycho.

936
01:11:16,400 --> 01:11:17,800
The guy was wired.

937
01:11:18,100 --> 01:11:21,100
He had this attitude, like
he could get anything he wanted.

938
01:11:21,300 --> 01:11:22,800
Any contacts, friends?

939
01:11:23,300 --> 01:11:26,000
A white dude came to visit him
every week he was here.

940
01:11:26,200 --> 01:11:27,800
For a whole year without fail.

941
01:11:28,100 --> 01:11:29,600
- Got a name?
- Yeah.

942
01:11:29,900 --> 01:11:31,700
What was the name
of the white dude?

943
01:11:31,900 --> 01:11:34,300
He came to visit Sartain every week.

944
01:11:34,800 --> 01:11:37,200
Wasley. Leroy Wasley.

945
01:11:37,800 --> 01:11:39,800
Leroy Wasley?

946
01:11:41,600 --> 01:11:46,100
"Officer Calden and his partner,
Officer Leroy Wasley...

947
01:11:46,600 --> 01:11:50,400
...working undercover cocaine buy.
A standoff developed.

948
01:11:50,700 --> 01:11:54,900
Suspect demanded to see the cash.
Calden demanded to see the cocaine.

949
01:11:57,300 --> 01:12:00,700
Officer Calden was shot twice
in the chest.

950
01:12:01,500 --> 01:12:04,100
Suspect got away with $100,000.

951
01:12:04,700 --> 01:12:08,100
Some suspicion that Officer Wasley...

952
01:12:08,400 --> 01:12:11,300
...may be involved
with the drug dealers."

953
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:13,900
If the feds thought
Wasley was dirty...

954
01:12:14,100 --> 01:12:16,700
...why would they let him back up
my dad on a deal?

955
01:12:17,200 --> 01:12:19,500
Because they couldn't prove it,
I guess.

956
01:12:19,800 --> 01:12:22,100
"After an exhaustive
four-month investigation...

957
01:12:22,400 --> 01:12:25,300
...the case against Officer Wasley
was dropped...

958
01:12:26,100 --> 01:12:27,800
...due to a lack of evidence."

959
01:12:31,200 --> 01:12:33,100
Joe, I want to kill him.

960
01:12:33,400 --> 01:12:36,400
Easy. Easy.

961
01:12:37,500 --> 01:12:39,800
There's a real can of worms here.

962
01:12:41,100 --> 01:12:42,700
"Wasley wasn't the only backup.

963
01:12:42,900 --> 01:12:45,200
There were three uniformed officers
in the alley.

964
01:12:45,500 --> 01:12:48,400
Two of them took off
after the suspect.

965
01:12:49,300 --> 01:12:51,200
One of them...

966
01:12:51,500 --> 01:12:54,800
...came into the room to find out..."
Oh, my God!

967
01:12:57,800 --> 01:12:59,700
Look at this name.

968
01:13:00,100 --> 01:13:02,500
Bernard Macko.

969
01:13:03,100 --> 01:13:06,200
- Bennie Macko?
- Bennie Macko.

970
01:13:06,500 --> 01:13:09,600
Wasley and Macko.
Macko and Wasley.

971
01:13:11,300 --> 01:13:13,700
Something's going on here.

972
01:13:16,900 --> 01:13:20,100
Oh, God. I gotta be somewhere.
You okay?

973
01:13:20,700 --> 01:13:22,600
Yeah, I'm good. Go ahead.

974
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:24,700
Take it easy.

975
01:13:31,300 --> 01:13:35,600
Hey, Rubes.
Look, IA's on my ass.

976
01:13:35,900 --> 01:13:37,900
Grab some takeout,
meet me at Mt. Olympus.

977
01:13:38,200 --> 01:13:39,800
I don't want to go to the house.

978
01:14:20,200 --> 01:14:21,700
Rube?

979
01:14:23,900 --> 01:14:25,800
Ruby, where are you?

980
01:14:28,200 --> 01:14:29,700
Rube?

981
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:37,400
Oh, dear.
Detective, you found me.

982
01:14:37,800 --> 01:14:40,400
You're under arrest, young lady.

983
01:14:43,100 --> 01:14:46,000
Please don't put the cuffs on me.

984
01:14:50,800 --> 01:14:54,800
You have the right to remain silent.
You understand?

985
01:14:55,500 --> 01:14:59,800
Gavilan with Marty Wheeler, attorney
from the music business. Sleazeball.

986
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:03,500
Here's Gavilan drinking on duty.
We've got photos, date, time-stamped.

987
01:15:03,900 --> 01:15:05,600
This is not criminal.

988
01:15:05,800 --> 01:15:07,200
I need criminal shit.

989
01:15:08,100 --> 01:15:11,400
Well, boss, this may not be
criminal shit, but...

990
01:15:23,300 --> 01:15:25,400
- What is this?
- "Nice house."

991
01:15:28,700 --> 01:15:29,600
You think so?

992
01:15:29,900 --> 01:15:31,400
That's Gavilan's house.

993
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:34,200
That's his front porch.

994
01:15:35,900 --> 01:15:37,800
It's a classic...

995
01:15:38,400 --> 01:15:39,700
...whose time hasn't come.

996
01:15:39,900 --> 01:15:42,600
And her car was there all night.

997
01:15:50,800 --> 01:15:52,600
Where is he now?

998
01:15:53,900 --> 01:15:55,000
We lost him.

999
01:15:55,400 --> 01:15:56,500
Where's she?

1000
01:15:56,800 --> 01:15:59,600
This is a very romantic idea.

1001
01:16:00,500 --> 01:16:03,400
- You're a stud.
- No.

1002
01:16:05,100 --> 01:16:06,800
My partner's a stud.

1003
01:16:07,800 --> 01:16:09,500
But I've got a few...

1004
01:16:10,600 --> 01:16:12,800
...veteran moves.

1005
01:16:17,700 --> 01:16:20,200
If I take my ginkgo...

1006
01:16:20,500 --> 01:16:23,400
...I can still remember
where I put the Viagra.

1007
01:16:28,700 --> 01:16:30,600
You really like this house?

1008
01:16:30,900 --> 01:16:34,400
I'll offer you 675
and not a penny more.

1009
01:16:34,800 --> 01:16:36,500
Collateral?

1010
01:16:37,000 --> 01:16:38,700
You're looking at it.

1011
01:16:58,700 --> 01:17:01,200
Sgt. Gavilan,
we're taking you downtown.

1012
01:17:17,900 --> 01:17:19,800
What a night.

1013
01:17:19,900 --> 01:17:22,200
Just one question, asshole.

1014
01:17:22,500 --> 01:17:24,900
Why me?
You got no probable cause.

1015
01:17:25,200 --> 01:17:28,400
- I'm a good cop.
- Yeah.

1016
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:45,600
You have the right to remain silent.

1017
01:17:45,700 --> 01:17:46,300
You have the right to remain silent.

1018
01:17:46,500 --> 01:17:48,700
Here we go, Joe.

1019
01:17:49,000 --> 01:17:51,800
You have the right to have an
attorney during questioning.

1020
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:53,500
- You understand?
- Yes.

1021
01:17:53,800 --> 01:17:56,200
I do understand the rights
you've explained to me.

1022
01:17:56,400 --> 01:17:58,700
But you know what,
I'm not gonna remain silent...

1023
01:17:59,000 --> 01:18:03,600
...and I do not need an attorney
because this is all bullshit!

1024
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:05,900
And you can put that on the record!

1025
01:18:06,200 --> 01:18:08,700
There's absolutely no need
to take your tie off...

1026
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:10,700
...during questioning, Mr. Calden.

1027
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:12,900
Why's he taking his shoes off?

1028
01:18:13,100 --> 01:18:15,600
- I've got questions for you.
- Questions for me.

1029
01:18:15,800 --> 01:18:17,900
I got questions for you.
My first is:

1030
01:18:18,200 --> 01:18:22,000
How does a lightweight, needle-dick
pencil pusher get assigned to IA?

1031
01:18:22,700 --> 01:18:24,400
Oh, he's up on the table.

1032
01:18:24,600 --> 01:18:26,500
- What is he doing?
- He's on the table.

1033
01:18:26,800 --> 01:18:30,000
This conversation's being recorded.
This will reflect very badly...

1034
01:18:30,200 --> 01:18:32,100
Excuse me.
Gavilan.

1035
01:18:32,400 --> 01:18:33,800
What, he's got a phone?

1036
01:18:34,100 --> 01:18:36,800
Jerry! Slow down, Jerry.

1037
01:18:37,100 --> 01:18:40,900
- Excuse me!
- I'm busy here.

1038
01:18:42,200 --> 01:18:43,800
Okay. He's "oming."

1039
01:18:44,100 --> 01:18:47,200
There are some discrepancies
with your income and your spending.

1040
01:18:47,400 --> 01:18:50,500
You mean, like, I'm spending
more than I'm making?

1041
01:18:50,700 --> 01:18:51,800
Is that news?

1042
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:53,200
Keep talking.

1043
01:18:53,300 --> 01:18:55,600
I think he's centering.
He's finding his center.

1044
01:18:57,700 --> 01:18:58,600
Gavilan.

1045
01:18:58,900 --> 01:19:00,400
What the...? What is this?

1046
01:19:00,600 --> 01:19:03,100
Julius, calm down, Julius.
It's not over.

1047
01:19:03,500 --> 01:19:04,900
Julius, it's never over.

1048
01:19:05,100 --> 01:19:06,300
Get him off the phone!

1049
01:19:06,900 --> 01:19:07,900
Guys?

1050
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:10,700
Gavilan. Cleo.

1051
01:19:11,600 --> 01:19:13,500
- Police business.
- "Joe?"

1052
01:19:13,700 --> 01:19:16,300
I can't talk.
I'll call you back later, all right?

1053
01:19:19,600 --> 01:19:20,500
Gavilan.

1054
01:19:21,600 --> 01:19:22,800
Hey, Ruby.

1055
01:19:25,900 --> 01:19:27,100
What is going on in...?

1056
01:19:29,300 --> 01:19:30,800
Muscles, man. I mean, that's...

1057
01:19:31,100 --> 01:19:32,100
Make him talk!

1058
01:19:32,300 --> 01:19:37,300
I have got the most intense
compression of the L4 and L5.

1059
01:19:37,800 --> 01:19:41,500
We have allegations
of commingling of funds.

1060
01:19:41,800 --> 01:19:45,700
I've been told that some yoga
and some massage is really...

1061
01:19:46,100 --> 01:19:48,400
Oh, yoga, yoga, yoga.
That's great.

1062
01:19:48,600 --> 01:19:51,100
You can't hold out for 7.
Jerry, 7...

1063
01:19:51,400 --> 01:19:53,700
That's great!
I think that's enough. I'm sorry.

1064
01:19:53,900 --> 01:19:56,800
We're that close, Jerry.

1065
01:19:57,000 --> 01:19:58,000
Jerry?

1066
01:19:58,600 --> 01:20:00,400
That looks really hard.

1067
01:20:02,300 --> 01:20:04,900
His position.
His position looks really hard...

1068
01:20:05,200 --> 01:20:07,500
He's not even...
He's not even talking, is he?

1069
01:20:08,200 --> 01:20:09,700
...to do.

1070
01:20:12,500 --> 01:20:13,900
A tree?

1071
01:20:15,800 --> 01:20:17,100
Now he's a tree?

1072
01:20:17,900 --> 01:20:20,700
This is a setup.
And it will not hold up!

1073
01:20:20,900 --> 01:20:22,900
I'm sure Gavilan is
next door right now...

1074
01:20:23,200 --> 01:20:25,400
...maintaining complete
professional integrity.

1075
01:20:25,700 --> 01:20:27,500
And you know it!

1076
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:30,700
What the hell is going on?
Did you say anything in there?

1077
01:20:31,000 --> 01:20:33,700
- Of course not. You?
- My phone wouldn't stop ringing.

1078
01:20:33,900 --> 01:20:35,700
Joe, K.C.!

1079
01:20:37,300 --> 01:20:39,600
This is insane.
Can you figure this out?

1080
01:20:39,900 --> 01:20:41,400
No!

1081
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:46,200
But I played my last card buying you
a couple of hours, so you figure it out!

1082
01:20:54,800 --> 01:20:56,900
What did you want
to talk to me about?

1083
01:20:57,900 --> 01:21:00,600
- I like you, Joe.
- Don't bullshit me.

1084
01:21:00,900 --> 01:21:04,200
You didn't talk to Vice,
so I made a deal with them.

1085
01:21:04,500 --> 01:21:07,200
- What are you talking about?
- They agreed to back off...

1086
01:21:07,500 --> 01:21:08,900
...if I agree to testify.

1087
01:21:09,200 --> 01:21:11,900
- Testify against whom?
- You.

1088
01:21:12,900 --> 01:21:16,000
I was approached by Lt. Macko.

1089
01:21:16,400 --> 01:21:20,700
Said he heard that you and I
were involved sexually.

1090
01:21:22,300 --> 01:21:26,800
And maybe you and some of my girls
had, you know, relationships.

1091
01:21:28,600 --> 01:21:30,600
The kid too.

1092
01:21:31,700 --> 01:21:33,900
I don't know what you did
to piss Macko off...

1093
01:21:34,300 --> 01:21:36,800
...but he cut me a deal
and I took it.

1094
01:21:37,200 --> 01:21:41,000
And you're telling me this
because you like me, huh?

1095
01:21:41,400 --> 01:21:43,300
Yeah, Joe.

1096
01:21:43,600 --> 01:21:45,600
I thought you should know.

1097
01:21:54,500 --> 01:21:56,400
Fuck! Bitch!

1098
01:22:04,100 --> 01:22:05,500
- Gavilan.
- "Joe, listen".

1099
01:22:05,700 --> 01:22:08,400
Bennie's going to the DA right now,
not even waiting.

1100
01:22:08,700 --> 01:22:12,700
And the stakeout at Sartain's house
says he hasn't been seen in 24 hours.

1101
01:22:13,100 --> 01:22:14,900
And he hasn't been
at Sartain Records.

1102
01:22:15,100 --> 01:22:16,700
Thanks.

1103
01:22:17,000 --> 01:22:19,400
- What?
- This guy, Sartain.

1104
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:21,800
I don't even know where to find him.

1105
01:22:22,100 --> 01:22:24,000
Wait a second.

1106
01:22:24,900 --> 01:22:26,400
I got one idea.

1107
01:22:28,400 --> 01:22:30,000
Hey, Rube.

1108
01:22:30,200 --> 01:22:33,500
You ever done any psychic work
for the police?

1109
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:37,200
You gonna be home
for the next half-hour? Great.

1110
01:22:37,500 --> 01:22:39,000
What are you laughing at?

1111
01:22:54,900 --> 01:22:57,200
- It's gonna work.
- This is ridiculous.

1112
01:22:57,400 --> 01:22:59,000
Joe, be quiet, please.

1113
01:23:03,400 --> 01:23:05,000
What are you doing?

1114
01:23:07,000 --> 01:23:10,200
I'm getting centered,
and if you don't leave me alone...

1115
01:23:10,400 --> 01:23:11,900
Leave her alone for a second.

1116
01:23:12,200 --> 01:23:15,200
Flip a coin, make some shit up.
I don't care.

1117
01:23:17,000 --> 01:23:17,900
Sorry.

1118
01:23:19,300 --> 01:23:20,900
Continue, please.

1119
01:23:36,800 --> 01:23:39,800
There's a house on Sunset Plaza.

1120
01:23:40,100 --> 01:23:41,000
Yes?

1121
01:23:43,500 --> 01:23:45,400
But nobody's there.

1122
01:23:45,600 --> 01:23:47,100
Okay.

1123
01:23:48,800 --> 01:23:50,900
We must move quickly.

1124
01:23:53,000 --> 01:23:54,700
Move quickly.

1125
01:23:59,500 --> 01:24:01,100
- Turn right.
- Right?

1126
01:24:01,400 --> 01:24:04,200
I see Rodeo Drive.

1127
01:24:04,500 --> 01:24:07,300
- What happened to Sunset Plaza?
- Give her a break, Joe.

1128
01:24:08,100 --> 01:24:10,000
We're getting close.

1129
01:24:10,500 --> 01:24:12,300
Hold on, hold on. We're here.

1130
01:24:12,400 --> 01:24:13,600
- Here?
- Here, yeah.

1131
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:14,900
- Okay.
- Here?

1132
01:24:15,100 --> 01:24:16,400
We're here.

1133
01:24:21,500 --> 01:24:22,400
Here.

1134
01:24:22,700 --> 01:24:24,500
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1135
01:24:28,700 --> 01:24:30,200
- In here.
- You sure?

1136
01:24:30,500 --> 01:24:31,800
Shut up.

1137
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:35,500
- Welcome to Beverly Hills...
- I am not in the mood.

1138
01:24:38,300 --> 01:24:41,300
That would look so great on me.

1139
01:24:41,600 --> 01:24:43,300
Ruby! How nice to see you!

1140
01:24:43,600 --> 01:24:46,300
I love that. How much is it?

1141
01:24:46,600 --> 01:24:48,900
- Don't worry.
- That is cute.

1142
01:24:49,900 --> 01:24:52,100
She's shopping.

1143
01:24:52,500 --> 01:24:54,000
Let her shop.

1144
01:24:54,200 --> 01:24:55,800
We have it in black and purple.

1145
01:24:56,200 --> 01:24:58,200
I'm out of here.

1146
01:24:58,500 --> 01:24:59,400
Goddamn it, Joe!

1147
01:24:59,700 --> 01:25:02,700
- Do you have that in size 2?
- Yes, we do. But we also have...

1148
01:25:03,500 --> 01:25:05,100
This is ridiculous.

1149
01:25:05,400 --> 01:25:08,400
You gotta give her some space.
We got nothing else to go on.

1150
01:25:12,800 --> 01:25:15,700
- Sartain! Right there in the black SUV!
- Get the car!

1151
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:17,000
Go!

1152
01:25:18,300 --> 01:25:19,600
Move it!

1153
01:25:19,900 --> 01:25:21,500
- Keys.
- Yeah, they're in there.

1154
01:25:22,300 --> 01:25:23,200
Hey! Hey!

1155
01:25:23,400 --> 01:25:25,600
- Come on!
- Hey, stop!

1156
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:27,200
Stop, damn it!

1157
01:25:31,800 --> 01:25:34,300
- You owe me $10.
- I'll give it to you later.

1158
01:25:42,500 --> 01:25:44,100
Hey, stop!

1159
01:25:44,400 --> 01:25:46,500
Stop, goddamn it!

1160
01:25:47,700 --> 01:25:48,800
- Go! Go!
- You good?

1161
01:25:49,200 --> 01:25:50,500
I'm going!

1162
01:25:51,900 --> 01:25:53,700
Don't speed. You're in Beverly Hills.

1163
01:25:54,000 --> 01:25:56,200
Goddamn it, I don't want a ticket!

1164
01:25:57,100 --> 01:25:58,800
- Here we are.
- There he is!

1165
01:26:07,600 --> 01:26:10,000
- Jesus. Don't do this.
- Out of the way!

1166
01:26:10,200 --> 01:26:12,100
- This is...
- Out of the way!

1167
01:26:15,900 --> 01:26:17,700
Okay. Get out of the way!

1168
01:26:22,300 --> 01:26:23,500
That's him, Danny.

1169
01:26:23,700 --> 01:26:24,800
Right here. Turn!

1170
01:26:27,400 --> 01:26:28,900
- Out of the car!
- Easy, boss.

1171
01:26:29,200 --> 01:26:30,800
- Get out of the car!
- Hey, I quit!

1172
01:26:33,700 --> 01:26:34,700
Damn it!

1173
01:26:40,600 --> 01:26:41,900
Joe, you all right?

1174
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:45,100
Son of a bitch!
Come on! Go! Go!

1175
01:26:56,100 --> 01:26:57,700
Stay with him.

1176
01:26:58,000 --> 01:27:00,600
I am not going back to prison
on this bullshit!

1177
01:27:04,400 --> 01:27:06,700
- Get out of the way!
- Jesus Christ. Stop!

1178
01:27:08,400 --> 01:27:11,500
- Police! Get out! Move the truck!
- Get out of the way!

1179
01:27:11,800 --> 01:27:13,000
Move it!

1180
01:27:13,500 --> 01:27:14,700
- God.
- Jesus Christ!

1181
01:27:15,000 --> 01:27:16,900
If it's not one thing,
it's another.

1182
01:27:21,000 --> 01:27:22,400
This is Gavilan.

1183
01:27:23,800 --> 01:27:27,600
In pursuit of possible 187 suspects.
Black Escalade, eastbound on Sunset.

1184
01:27:28,400 --> 01:27:31,600
While flying over the Hollywood
Freeway, we hear about a chase...

1185
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:33,700
... on Sunset Boulevard.

1186
01:27:33,800 --> 01:27:36,600
If you're driving in Hollywood
heading to Mid-Wilshire...

1187
01:27:36,900 --> 01:27:39,200
... and Beverly Hills,
I suggest you stay away.

1188
01:27:39,400 --> 01:27:41,400
The police need you
out of the area.

1189
01:27:51,800 --> 01:27:53,100
- Get down!
- Watch!

1190
01:27:56,800 --> 01:27:58,600
- Gavilan.
- Are you okay?

1191
01:27:58,900 --> 01:28:00,200
Yeah. Honey, we had to go.

1192
01:28:00,300 --> 01:28:02,700
That guy showed up across the street.
There...

1193
01:28:02,900 --> 01:28:03,900
I know.

1194
01:28:04,600 --> 01:28:08,300
- Look, I gotta go. I'll talk to you soon.
- Take care.

1195
01:28:09,700 --> 01:28:12,200
We got two more black
and whites on the chase.

1196
01:28:12,400 --> 01:28:16,300
In pursuit of a silver Mustang,
black Escalade, Sunset Boulevard.

1197
01:28:16,700 --> 01:28:18,600
Doing about 50 miles an hour.

1198
01:28:18,900 --> 01:28:20,800
Who are they chasing,
me or them?

1199
01:28:21,000 --> 01:28:23,700
Both of us now!
You just committed three felonies!

1200
01:28:24,200 --> 01:28:25,800
Twice!

1201
01:28:27,800 --> 01:28:29,600
Gavilan. Yeah, Jerry.

1202
01:28:29,900 --> 01:28:31,000
No, I can talk.

1203
01:28:32,800 --> 01:28:34,600
Six... You'll take 6.9 now?

1204
01:28:34,800 --> 01:28:37,400
I don't know, it might be too late.
I'll make a call.

1205
01:28:48,700 --> 01:28:50,300
No. Go, go! Cut over!

1206
01:28:51,900 --> 01:28:53,100
Get out of the way!

1207
01:28:55,000 --> 01:28:56,200
Sorry.

1208
01:28:56,500 --> 01:28:58,800
Let me know when you're back
on the street.

1209
01:28:59,000 --> 01:29:00,400
Don't worry.

1210
01:29:01,000 --> 01:29:03,600
Air Six, be advised,
we're getting crowded up here.

1211
01:29:03,800 --> 01:29:05,300
A lot of choppers in the sky.

1212
01:29:05,500 --> 01:29:08,800
It is not just crazy in the streets.
It is crazy up in the air.

1213
01:29:09,100 --> 01:29:12,600
We have one, two, three.
I see Vera, Jennifer, York.

1214
01:29:13,000 --> 01:29:14,100
I see Lauren, Vera.

1215
01:29:18,600 --> 01:29:21,700
- Get a deal on that house yet?
- Dicking me around, but I'm on it.

1216
01:29:23,500 --> 01:29:25,200
Get out of the way!

1217
01:29:26,000 --> 01:29:27,400
- Get out...
- Watch!

1218
01:29:27,700 --> 01:29:29,000
I'm watching! I'm watching!

1219
01:29:33,200 --> 01:29:35,900
Julius, he says he'll take 6.9 now.

1220
01:29:37,000 --> 01:29:38,700
That's what he says.

1221
01:29:40,100 --> 01:29:42,400
Let me make a call. Bye.

1222
01:29:50,500 --> 01:29:52,000
- Get out!
- Watch! Get off Sunset!

1223
01:29:52,300 --> 01:29:54,200
- Go! Go!
- I got them.

1224
01:30:05,400 --> 01:30:06,500
Is that Joe Gavilan?

1225
01:30:11,200 --> 01:30:13,700
They'll try to travel
up to Hollywood Boulevard...

1226
01:30:14,100 --> 01:30:17,200
...where a huge crowd is in front of
Grauman's Chinese Theatre.

1227
01:30:17,500 --> 01:30:21,300
I don't know what's going on there,
but this is a very dangerous situation.

1228
01:30:21,600 --> 01:30:26,100
We'll honor him in one of the most
famous traditions here in Hollywood.

1229
01:30:27,600 --> 01:30:29,200
Watch it!

1230
01:30:47,800 --> 01:30:50,400
Goddamn it! Idiot!

1231
01:30:50,800 --> 01:30:52,700
That's it! I'm driving! That's it!

1232
01:30:52,800 --> 01:30:55,100
All right. Fine!
You think you can do better?

1233
01:30:55,400 --> 01:30:56,500
Go ahead. Be my guest!

1234
01:30:56,800 --> 01:31:00,600
- Damn it! You're trying to kill me! Idiot!
- Come on! Go!

1235
01:31:01,000 --> 01:31:03,900
- Kill me.
- Go ahead.

1236
01:31:11,000 --> 01:31:14,300
This is a tradition
that started back in 1927...

1237
01:31:16,100 --> 01:31:18,000
...when a little dog named Zorro...

1238
01:31:18,400 --> 01:31:20,200
Yeah, this is much better. Thank you.

1239
01:31:20,500 --> 01:31:22,600
...jumped out of Mary Pickford's car...

1240
01:31:23,700 --> 01:31:24,900
...into wet cement.

1241
01:31:34,300 --> 01:31:37,000
- Nice driving.
- Sorry.

1242
01:31:37,400 --> 01:31:41,000
The Mustang was hit by the Escalade
and this chase came to a halt...

1243
01:31:41,200 --> 01:31:43,200
... in front of Grauman's Theatre...

1244
01:31:43,400 --> 01:31:45,700
... where someone was getting
their star.

1245
01:31:56,300 --> 01:31:57,900
I got Wasley!

1246
01:31:59,500 --> 01:32:00,700
Get out of the way!

1247
01:32:01,200 --> 01:32:03,500
Get down! Get out of the way!

1248
01:32:05,700 --> 01:32:08,300
Police! Police! Stay down!

1249
01:32:10,300 --> 01:32:13,400
Mayhem is breaking out,
resulting in a foot pursuit.

1250
01:32:13,600 --> 01:32:15,400
They're running
down Hollywood Blvd.

1251
01:32:15,600 --> 01:32:17,500
They've got their weapons drawn.
"We've"...

1252
01:32:17,800 --> 01:32:22,500
People are scrambling out of the way.
Everyone's running. It's a mess.

1253
01:32:22,900 --> 01:32:25,200
Excuse me. Sorry. Excuse me.

1254
01:32:39,700 --> 01:32:41,300
Look out down there!

1255
01:32:44,700 --> 01:32:47,100
Holy shit!

1256
01:32:50,100 --> 01:32:52,500
Oh, God!

1257
01:32:53,500 --> 01:32:55,700
That was not the way I planned it.

1258
01:32:55,900 --> 01:32:58,300
I'm a cop. Help me up.

1259
01:32:59,800 --> 01:33:01,300
Thank you.

1260
01:33:01,800 --> 01:33:04,700
I'm okay. I'm all right. Thank you.

1261
01:33:05,900 --> 01:33:07,900
Hey, move, move. Move!

1262
01:33:10,100 --> 01:33:11,700
Hey! Get out of the way! Police!

1263
01:33:11,900 --> 01:33:13,700
- Get out!
- Hey, stop!

1264
01:33:13,900 --> 01:33:15,300
Hey!

1265
01:33:17,100 --> 01:33:18,100
Stop!

1266
01:33:19,000 --> 01:33:21,600
Shit! Hey, police.
Get out of your car.

1267
01:33:21,800 --> 01:33:24,000
- What the hell?
- I need your car.

1268
01:33:24,200 --> 01:33:26,100
- I'll get it back to you.
- My family's...

1269
01:33:26,400 --> 01:33:29,500
Hey, come on!
Police! Somebody help me!

1270
01:33:35,200 --> 01:33:36,400
Watch out! Police!

1271
01:33:36,500 --> 01:33:38,800
Get out of the way!
Watch out! Police!

1272
01:33:39,400 --> 01:33:40,800
Police!

1273
01:34:11,400 --> 01:34:12,500
You need to slow down.

1274
01:34:12,800 --> 01:34:16,000
I can't slow down, ma'am. I'm sorry.
I'm chasing this guy here.

1275
01:34:16,500 --> 01:34:18,900
- It's kind of fun, huh?
- No, it's not!

1276
01:34:19,400 --> 01:34:22,300
We're gonna die.
I know we're going to die.

1277
01:34:22,600 --> 01:34:24,500
Yes, actually. We will die.

1278
01:34:24,800 --> 01:34:28,200
- No, you're not gonna die.
- I don't mean right now.

1279
01:34:33,300 --> 01:34:35,400
Hey! Get out of the car! Police!

1280
01:34:35,600 --> 01:34:37,000
Police! Get out... Hey!

1281
01:34:37,300 --> 01:34:39,300
- Hey, look! Come on!
- Get out of here!

1282
01:34:40,000 --> 01:34:42,100
- Hey! That's mine!
- Give me that!

1283
01:34:51,300 --> 01:34:52,800
- Bitch!
- Asshole!

1284
01:34:52,900 --> 01:34:55,300
Move! Police! Move!

1285
01:34:56,700 --> 01:34:58,400
Move over!

1286
01:34:59,700 --> 01:35:01,900
Goddamn it! You all right?

1287
01:35:02,300 --> 01:35:05,600
Watch out! Move! Move! Move!

1288
01:35:11,700 --> 01:35:14,200
Hey, kids,
Hindus say that life is a rebirth.

1289
01:35:14,400 --> 01:35:16,000
Ganesh had his head chopped off.

1290
01:35:16,200 --> 01:35:18,700
They put an elephant's head
on and he lived forever.

1291
01:35:19,000 --> 01:35:20,800
- You're crazy!
- Kids, listen to me.

1292
01:35:21,100 --> 01:35:23,700
It's not a bad thing
if we do die, all right?

1293
01:35:25,700 --> 01:35:27,500
- Get out of the cab!
- This is my cab!

1294
01:35:27,700 --> 01:35:29,700
My cab! My cab!

1295
01:35:30,000 --> 01:35:32,600
No, man, it's my cab. It's my cab!

1296
01:35:32,900 --> 01:35:35,100
- Get in the car!
- Police! Police!

1297
01:35:35,500 --> 01:35:36,700
I am the police!

1298
01:35:36,900 --> 01:35:40,300
For chrissake, get in the cab!
Move! Move!

1299
01:35:43,500 --> 01:35:45,000
If you wreck my cab, the city...

1300
01:35:45,500 --> 01:35:47,900
Don't worry. Sit back.
I'm a very good driver.

1301
01:36:04,400 --> 01:36:06,200
I don't want to die!

1302
01:36:06,500 --> 01:36:08,900
We're not gonna die, all right?

1303
01:36:09,200 --> 01:36:10,700
Shut up, okay? Please!

1304
01:36:16,900 --> 01:36:18,000
Oh, my God!

1305
01:36:32,400 --> 01:36:34,500
Wait a minute, man.
Where's my fare?

1306
01:36:34,700 --> 01:36:36,700
- How much?
- Ten dollars.

1307
01:36:37,000 --> 01:36:41,000
Ten dollars. Ten dollars.
There's a tip!

1308
01:37:18,800 --> 01:37:20,400
Move! Move! Move!

1309
01:37:31,600 --> 01:37:33,100
Hey! Hey!

1310
01:37:45,900 --> 01:37:47,400
Hey, cop. What about 6.75?

1311
01:37:47,600 --> 01:37:49,800
- I don't think that'll do it!
- Not a penny more!

1312
01:38:01,400 --> 01:38:04,200
Get down! Get down!
Get the hell down!

1313
01:38:07,600 --> 01:38:09,000
Get up! In front of the door!

1314
01:38:10,800 --> 01:38:13,000
Get in front of the frigging door!

1315
01:38:14,500 --> 01:38:16,500
Come on, come on,
come on, come on!

1316
01:38:26,800 --> 01:38:28,700
What are you doing?

1317
01:38:36,400 --> 01:38:39,600
Jerry, I've just been with Julius.
I've twisted his arm.

1318
01:38:40,000 --> 01:38:42,200
I have a firm offer for 6.75.

1319
01:38:42,500 --> 01:38:45,800
Yes, sir, 6.75. Firm.

1320
01:38:48,100 --> 01:38:50,700
- You will? You will?
- Oh, God.

1321
01:38:51,000 --> 01:38:52,800
You will?

1322
01:38:53,200 --> 01:38:54,700
That's fantastic.

1323
01:38:55,000 --> 01:38:59,300
I'll start the paperwork in the morning,
soon as I get to the office, okay?

1324
01:38:59,600 --> 01:39:02,600
I've gotta run now.
Thank you very much.

1325
01:39:07,000 --> 01:39:09,900
I'm a real-estate broker.

1326
01:39:14,500 --> 01:39:16,200
Hey.

1327
01:39:50,300 --> 01:39:53,400
Yeah, he needs a pop-out trailer,
cook, driver...

1328
01:39:53,800 --> 01:39:57,800
...trainer with a gym that travels,
dog walker, hair and makeup guys.

1329
01:39:58,100 --> 01:39:59,800
I'll fax you the rest of the perks.

1330
01:40:29,000 --> 01:40:31,200
- Don't shoot me, man.
- Don't shoot?

1331
01:40:32,300 --> 01:40:34,500
Don't shoot me.
Don't shoot, Wasley.

1332
01:40:34,700 --> 01:40:36,500
- Please, don't shoot me.
- Please?

1333
01:40:36,700 --> 01:40:39,500
Are you shitting me? Please?
You're not going to beg.

1334
01:40:39,800 --> 01:40:41,600
- I'm begging. Please!
- Jesus Christ.

1335
01:40:41,900 --> 01:40:44,900
H2O didn't beg. They screamed
and hollered. They didn't beg.

1336
01:40:45,300 --> 01:40:48,000
And fat-ass Klepto ran a couple yards.
You can run.

1337
01:40:48,200 --> 01:40:51,100
I don't even want to be a cop anymore.
I want to quit.

1338
01:40:51,300 --> 01:40:54,900
I won't tell anybody about this,
I swear to God. Please, don't kill me!

1339
01:40:55,200 --> 01:40:56,900
I don't want to die, okay?

1340
01:40:57,000 --> 01:40:59,200
But my father...
My father was your partner!

1341
01:40:59,400 --> 01:41:01,900
Just please, God, don't shoot me!
Please!

1342
01:41:02,200 --> 01:41:04,100
Shut up.

1343
01:41:04,200 --> 01:41:05,600
Don't talk about your father.

1344
01:41:05,900 --> 01:41:08,600
Your daddy didn't beg
when he got shot.

1345
01:41:08,900 --> 01:41:13,400
- He was a good cop.
- Please, don't shoot.

1346
01:41:18,200 --> 01:41:19,500
Don't do it!

1347
01:41:20,400 --> 01:41:22,100
Don't do it, Wasley. Don't!

1348
01:41:37,700 --> 01:41:39,600
That was a great performance.

1349
01:41:40,200 --> 01:41:42,300
Good enough to be
at least a Golden Globe.

1350
01:41:42,500 --> 01:41:45,000
I don't know about an Academy Award,
but a Golden Globe.

1351
01:41:45,900 --> 01:41:47,800
I believed it myself.

1352
01:41:48,100 --> 01:41:52,100
I mean, all the, "Don't kill me, man.
Don't freaking kill me."

1353
01:41:53,900 --> 01:41:56,500
I liked where you talked
about killing my father.

1354
01:42:04,100 --> 01:42:05,700
But it's okay.

1355
01:42:06,500 --> 01:42:09,200
'Cause I got it all right here.
See that?

1356
01:42:11,300 --> 01:42:15,600
Your confession and my performance,
all on one tape.

1357
01:42:16,000 --> 01:42:17,500
That will sell great.

1358
01:42:20,000 --> 01:42:23,200
Air Six, suspects are on the roof
of the old Broadway Building.

1359
01:42:23,500 --> 01:42:25,700
Shots have been fired.

1360
01:42:49,500 --> 01:42:53,300
Air Six, get on the horn and get
these news choppers out of here.

1361
01:42:53,600 --> 01:42:55,900
I can't work, I need orbit room.
Move them back.

1362
01:42:56,200 --> 01:42:58,100
He's telling us to get out of the way.

1363
01:42:59,300 --> 01:43:00,900
But we're not moving.
We're not.

1364
01:43:01,100 --> 01:43:03,200
L.A.P.D. Is trying to kick us
out of here.

1365
01:43:03,500 --> 01:43:05,900
We don't know who the good guy,
who the bad guy is.

1366
01:43:06,200 --> 01:43:08,900
I've never seen such drama
in Hollywood before.

1367
01:44:17,100 --> 01:44:18,100
We're on the roof.

1368
01:45:36,400 --> 01:45:37,400
Where is he?

1369
01:45:43,900 --> 01:45:46,700
- You want me to get him out?
- Leave him for the coroner.

1370
01:45:47,000 --> 01:45:50,400
- Where's the kid?
- Down that way.

1371
01:45:58,000 --> 01:45:59,500
You okay?

1372
01:46:00,000 --> 01:46:02,800
- Yeah. You?
- Don't I look okay?

1373
01:46:03,000 --> 01:46:04,900
Where's Sartain?

1374
01:46:07,800 --> 01:46:09,700
And Wasley?

1375
01:46:12,200 --> 01:46:13,200
Good job.

1376
01:46:18,200 --> 01:46:19,900
Good thing you didn't kill him.

1377
01:46:20,300 --> 01:46:22,200
You know me.
I don't like dead bodies.

1378
01:46:22,400 --> 01:46:24,800
I got arrest warrants
for Gavilan and Calden.

1379
01:46:25,100 --> 01:46:26,600
Hey, separate them!

1380
01:46:26,800 --> 01:46:29,700
I don't want them talking to anybody
until they get downtown.

1381
01:46:30,900 --> 01:46:32,400
Shut up and turn around, Bennie.

1382
01:46:32,800 --> 01:46:34,600
- What?
- Cuff him. Take him downtown.

1383
01:46:34,800 --> 01:46:36,700
What are you talking about?

1384
01:46:36,900 --> 01:46:40,700
Get your hands off me, son of a bitch!
You're making a big mistake, pal.

1385
01:46:41,000 --> 01:46:44,500
- You can kiss your career goodbye.
- Good.

1386
01:46:45,200 --> 01:46:46,700
Call my lawyer.

1387
01:46:53,600 --> 01:46:55,300
Great job.

1388
01:46:56,100 --> 01:46:59,200
You don't have to come tomorrow
if you don't feel up to it.

1389
01:46:59,500 --> 01:47:04,100
I said I would be there tomorrow night.
I'll be there, all right?

1390
01:47:04,800 --> 01:47:05,800
All right.

1391
01:47:07,000 --> 01:47:08,300
Damn it!

1392
01:47:08,600 --> 01:47:11,700
Drunk, drunk, animal thing, you!

1393
01:47:12,000 --> 01:47:13,800
Will all of you please
get out of here?

1394
01:47:14,800 --> 01:47:16,100
If you lay one hand on me...

1395
01:47:16,900 --> 01:47:21,200
- My sister's having a baby.
- This is so wrong. Get him out of here.

1396
01:47:21,500 --> 01:47:23,600
Let go of me, you sons of bitches!

1397
01:47:24,900 --> 01:47:27,100
Get him in bed,
put a cold towel on his head.

1398
01:47:27,300 --> 01:47:29,200
Some coffee would do him good
right now.

1399
01:47:29,500 --> 01:47:33,700
- Let's get him into the shower.
- Let go of me, you sons of bitches!

1400
01:47:36,800 --> 01:47:38,800
Take it easy.

1401
01:47:42,600 --> 01:47:45,400
- Let's get out of here.
- Poker should not be played...

1402
01:47:45,700 --> 01:47:47,600
...in a house with women!

1403
01:47:53,000 --> 01:47:54,000
Baby.

1404
01:47:59,700 --> 01:48:02,000
Eunice, I want my baby girl down here.

1405
01:48:02,200 --> 01:48:04,300
I'm just going to keep on calling,
if you...

1406
01:48:04,600 --> 01:48:06,200
Hey.

1407
01:48:11,700 --> 01:48:13,800
Stella!

1408
01:48:14,200 --> 01:48:15,300
Stella!

1409
01:48:15,600 --> 01:48:17,600
Quit howling out there.
Go back to bed!

1410
01:48:17,900 --> 01:48:19,700
Eunice, send my baby girl down here!

1411
01:48:20,000 --> 01:48:23,800
She ain't coming down till you quit
or they'll set the law on you.

1412
01:48:24,000 --> 01:48:26,100
- Come here.
- You can't beat up a girl...

1413
01:48:26,600 --> 01:48:28,900
...and expect her to come back!
- You suck.

1414
01:48:30,100 --> 01:48:31,300
Sit down.

1415
01:48:31,600 --> 01:48:33,600
Have some respect
or I'll kick your ass.

1416
01:48:33,800 --> 01:48:35,800
Stella, come down here, baby.

1417
01:48:36,100 --> 01:48:40,800
- Like they did last time.
- Eunice, send my baby girl down here.

1418
01:48:59,500 --> 01:49:01,200
Yeah. It's Calden.

1419
01:49:05,500 --> 01:49:07,800
- Gavilan.
- Yeah. I'll be there in 15.

1420
01:49:08,400 --> 01:49:10,400
West of Coldwater?

1421
01:49:11,000 --> 01:49:12,000
I can be there in 10.

1422
01:49:16,800 --> 01:49:20,100
Stella. Oh, baby,
don't ever leave me again.

1423
01:49:39,000 --> 01:49:40,700
- Hey, officer, help me out?
- Yeah.

1424
01:49:41,000 --> 01:49:43,300
- What's going on?
- Looks like you got a 187.

1425
01:49:43,500 --> 01:49:46,200
- Possible 927D.
- Thanks a lot.

1426
01:49:46,500 --> 01:49:50,600
He says we have a body and a half
with some pieces missing.

1427
01:49:50,900 --> 01:49:53,100
An Easter egg hunt.

1428
01:49:53,300 --> 01:49:56,200
You were pretty good in that play.
You really were.

1429
01:49:56,400 --> 01:49:58,000
You think so?

1430
01:49:58,400 --> 01:50:00,400
Yeah.

1431
01:50:00,700 --> 01:50:03,100
I don't know if I'm much of an actor.

1432
01:50:03,300 --> 01:50:07,000
- I think I'm just a cop.
- What do you mean, just a cop?

1433
01:50:07,400 --> 01:50:08,900
You really thought I was good?

1434
01:50:09,000 --> 01:50:12,900
Hey, I already said you were good.
Don't go begging me.

1435
01:50:13,300 --> 01:50:15,100
Looks like we'll be here a while.

1436
01:50:15,300 --> 01:50:17,600
Let's get going on some chow, huh?

1437
01:50:17,800 --> 01:50:21,700
Cheeseburger, well-done,
onion, pickle, no mayo.

1438
01:50:22,000 --> 01:50:26,100
- No rabbit food, okay?
- I'll have the same.
