1
00:03:13,999 --> 00:03:19,079
Little Ricky, where are you baby?
Come on honey... it's dinner time.

2
00:03:19,258 --> 00:03:24,469
It's your favourite flavour - Liver.
Where are you?

3
00:03:25,853 --> 00:03:31,099
There you are. Hey.. what're you doing under there?

4
00:03:32,573 --> 00:03:36,870
What you doing under there?
What's the matter?

5
00:03:39,543 --> 00:03:44,838
Oh..Ricky baby, what's the matter sweetheart?

6
00:04:07,508 --> 00:04:09,301
We're ready for you doctor.

7
00:04:15,271 --> 00:04:18,975
How is she?
- Still in the O.T. I haven't heard anything yet.

8
00:04:19,154 --> 00:04:24,069
When did this happen?
- He was waiting for her at her place when she got home from class.

9
00:04:24,246 --> 00:04:27,665
Forensics say it was the same man
who raped Cara Latham.

10
00:04:27,835 --> 00:04:30,328
Did you really need a forensics expert to tell you that?

11
00:04:30,507 --> 00:04:35,422
Andy.
Dana, when was the last time I asked your department to
beef up the security and cameras, right?

12
00:04:35,599 --> 00:04:38,805
I mean not the first four times. It's the last time.

13
00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:43,163
Don't get pissy with me professor.
I don't have the manpower to break up a fraternity party.

14
00:04:43,476 --> 00:04:44,781
Suction
- Suction.

15
00:04:45,042 --> 00:04:45,824
What's that pressure?

16
00:04:46,033 --> 00:04:48,850
Less than 70. Sixty-nine.
She's sliding down pretty fast.

17
00:04:49,111 --> 00:04:52,189
We're gonna lose her doctor.
- I would not bet my ranch on that.

18
00:04:52,545 --> 00:04:54,485
David, drop 0.2 ccs of epinephrine.

19
00:04:54,746 --> 00:04:56,416
Tanya, give me the stitch please.
- 3, 0 silk.

20
00:04:57,554 --> 00:05:00,723
We've gone at 63. Epinephrine doctor ?
- No, Not yet.

21
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:06,312
60.

22
00:05:07,446 --> 00:05:11,031
Still think it's a phenobarbital reaction?

23
00:05:13,289 --> 00:05:14,951
Epinephrine.

24
00:05:16,545 --> 00:05:19,964
And..
- At ease up on retraction pressure.

25
00:05:20,135 --> 00:05:23,756
65 & going up.
- No doubt about that.

26
00:05:23,933 --> 00:05:25,891
68.
- I don't believe that.

27
00:05:26,063 --> 00:05:28,982
72.
- How about your scissors?

28
00:05:29,151 --> 00:05:30,861
Metzenbaum.
- Beautiful.

29
00:05:32,365 --> 00:05:34,359
80.
- She's out of the woods.

30
00:05:36,538 --> 00:05:39,292
Great to practice medicine.
Irrigation please.

31
00:05:39,460 --> 00:05:43,412
Dr. Robertson, would you please close the wound for me?
Nice going, people.

32
00:05:46,389 --> 00:05:48,716
By the way, everybody:

33
00:05:48,894 --> 00:05:52,182
it's great to be in Saint Agnes.

34
00:05:56,574 --> 00:05:58,283
That was good work.

35
00:06:00,330 --> 00:06:02,906
Dr. Robertson...
May I call you Matthew ?
- Of course.

36
00:06:04,064 --> 00:06:05,493
Matthew....

37
00:06:06,675 --> 00:06:10,378
I'm the new guy around here and I want to make friends, so ....

38
00:06:10,556 --> 00:06:14,426
I'll say this to you and we'll start fresh.

39
00:06:16,482 --> 00:06:20,435
If you don't like my jokes, don't laugh.

40
00:06:20,615 --> 00:06:25,614
If you have a medical opinion, then please
speak up and speak up loud.

41
00:06:25,874 --> 00:06:30,587
But if you ever again tell me or my surgical
staff that we're going to lose a patient,

42
00:06:30,758 --> 00:06:35,174
...I'm going to take out your lungs
with a fuckin' ice cream scoop.

43
00:06:36,602 --> 00:06:38,430
Do you understand me?

44
00:06:40,067 --> 00:06:42,227
I'm not gonna like you, am I?

45
00:06:42,403 --> 00:06:46,949
Don't be ridiculous.
Everybody likes me.

46
00:06:54,463 --> 00:06:57,150
Dr. Hill !
- Ya.

47
00:06:57,471 --> 00:07:00,672
I'm Andy Safian.
I'm Associate Dean at the college & I wondered..

48
00:07:00,726 --> 00:07:04,062
if you could tell me anything about Bridget Kelly's condition.

49
00:07:04,233 --> 00:07:09,314
Well, she has a badly bruised liver but I
think she's gonna be just fine.

50
00:07:09,491 --> 00:07:11,782
Great. Thanks to you.

51
00:07:11,954 --> 00:07:16,916
Well, come to the midnight show, I love
to take the next of kin.

52
00:07:19,677 --> 00:07:20,988
It's Jed Hill, right?

53
00:07:23,180 --> 00:07:24,432
"Galloping" Jed Hill?

54
00:07:26,572 --> 00:07:27,375
Excuse me.

55
00:07:27,899 --> 00:07:30,606
We were at the high school together.

56
00:07:30,778 --> 00:07:33,917
You're kidding me.
You went to Van Buren?

57
00:07:33,919 --> 00:07:35,503
Yeah.
- Wow!

58
00:07:35,912 --> 00:07:40,173
How long you've been in Westerly?
- Well, I've been here about nine hours now. Van Buren, huh?

59
00:07:40,590 --> 00:07:44,719
Yeah, well, we weren't in the same... we didn't travel
in the same circles but...

60
00:07:44,887 --> 00:07:49,183
Did I give you a hard time?
- No, you didn't know who the hell I was. So..

61
00:07:51,032 --> 00:07:52,076
Dr. Hill...

62
00:07:53,930 --> 00:07:54,734
Hi Tanya!

63
00:07:55,530 --> 00:07:59,863
I just wanted to say congratulations.
We're all very happy that you're here.

64
00:08:00,038 --> 00:08:03,326
Well, thank you. It's..
it's nice to be here.

65
00:08:08,052 --> 00:08:10,841
Looks like you're again the popular man.

66
00:08:12,059 --> 00:08:16,689
I hope to see you around.
- Yeah, me too.

67
00:08:22,996 --> 00:08:24,740
Oh, that's wonderful, Michelle.

68
00:08:25,875 --> 00:08:30,172
Hey, why don't we try painting on a paper
& not on your arm?

69
00:08:30,341 --> 00:08:33,878
I am a monster.
- Teacher, teacher...

70
00:08:35,099 --> 00:08:37,972
Hey, don't you ever play with plastic bags or

71
00:08:38,146 --> 00:08:41,683
I'll tie you up and I'll feed you to little cape
monster, you got it?

72
00:08:50,961 --> 00:08:54,582
I heard what happened.
- Can you come on lunch now?

73
00:08:54,759 --> 00:08:56,420
in a minute.

74
00:09:01,812 --> 00:09:06,311
Yeah, the guy got in when she was
at her class.

75
00:09:06,487 --> 00:09:08,257
She's gonna be alright.
- Looks like it...

76
00:09:08,466 --> 00:09:14,245
turns out that the hospital has a new surgeon,
this whizkid from Mass General did a great job.

77
00:09:14,417 --> 00:09:19,166
So I went back to introduce myself, to thank him
& are you ready for this?

78
00:09:20,303 --> 00:09:23,259
We were at the High School together.
- Oh, no kidding.

79
00:09:25,562 --> 00:09:28,601
Speak of the Devil...
- And the Devil appears.

80
00:09:28,776 --> 00:09:31,732
I was just recounting all your experts' here.

81
00:09:31,907 --> 00:09:35,408
This is my wife, Tracy.
Tracy, this is Dr. Jed Hill.

82
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:37,574
A school friend of Andy.

83
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:41,833
This is Dr. Sullivan, Alan and Tracy Safian.
- Andy.

84
00:09:42,007 --> 00:09:45,046
Andy works at the college.
- He's Associate Dean, Mr. Hill.

85
00:09:45,220 --> 00:09:48,389
Fantastic.
- I don't leap tall buildings in a single bound.

86
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:51,232
But we are very proud of him.
- That's well. You should be.

87
00:09:51,399 --> 00:09:55,815
Listen, we're having a small reception to welcome Jed
to Saint Agnes. Why don't you come along?

88
00:09:55,990 --> 00:09:59,527
Oh, we'll have to go. We have a lunch appointment.
- Oh, maybe some other time.

89
00:09:59,705 --> 00:10:01,746
Definitely.

90
00:10:01,917 --> 00:10:05,169
Nice meeting you, Tracy.
- Yeah, nice to meet you.

91
00:10:10,306 --> 00:10:13,309
Well, we got the estimate from the plumber this morning.
- And?

92
00:10:14,981 --> 00:10:17,544
Are you ready for this?
- How much?

93
00:10:17,857 --> 00:10:23,694
It's... 13,000 and change.
- How much change?

94
00:10:23,872 --> 00:10:28,288
It's 14,000.
- Alright, forget it. I'm gonna do the work myself.

95
00:10:28,463 --> 00:10:30,255
I got a better idea.
- No.

96
00:10:30,425 --> 00:10:33,548
Well, just for a little while. It pays and goes,
we rent it to some visiting lecturer.

97
00:10:33,722 --> 00:10:37,509
I don't want to rent out the third floor.
I don't want a stranger in our house.

98
00:10:37,688 --> 00:10:40,097
Alright, suit yourself.

99
00:10:40,276 --> 00:10:43,944
Would've been nice living in
a home with running water but...

100
00:10:44,115 --> 00:10:45,990
I'm a simple girl.

101
00:10:48,457 --> 00:10:51,662
Hey, I'm gonna pick you up after work.
- No, it's okay.

102
00:10:51,837 --> 00:10:55,007
Forget it. I'm gonna pick you up.
There's a maniac who's in this town.

103
00:10:55,176 --> 00:10:59,259
Helen can give me a ride.
- She can? Are you sure?

104
00:11:02,981 --> 00:11:05,818
Make sure she waits until you're inside the house.

105
00:11:05,987 --> 00:11:09,489
I'll have her provide air coverage if you want.

106
00:11:12,373 --> 00:11:16,041
It's funny. I married a funny woman.

107
00:11:42,274 --> 00:11:43,578
See ya.
- Nice.

108
00:12:04,047 --> 00:12:08,796
You know in street clothes,
Helen looks positively masculine.
- What?

109
00:12:08,972 --> 00:12:13,602
Helen. You said you were getting a
ride home from Helen.

110
00:12:13,772 --> 00:12:17,903
Were you spying on me ?
- No, no. Looking out my window.

111
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:23,317
Then you were looking at Dennis Riley, my mother's
lawyer. He had papers for me to sign.

112
00:12:23,497 --> 00:12:25,906
What kind of papers?

113
00:12:26,085 --> 00:12:28,186
Something about my mother's estate.
What is this?

114
00:12:28,526 --> 00:12:30,503
Your mother's estate?
- Yes.

115
00:12:30,592 --> 00:12:33,630
You told me she barely got by in
her social welfare check (made her living).

116
00:12:33,807 --> 00:12:37,593
And now she's Lady Astor?
- Come on, Andy.

117
00:12:39,316 --> 00:12:41,282
There was a small account for the
cemetery arrangements.

118
00:12:41,699 --> 00:12:43,525
The money lacks about which Dennis
wanted to talk to me about.

119
00:12:43,645 --> 00:12:45,341
And now what is it you want to
talk to me about?

120
00:12:47,312 --> 00:12:48,356
Sorry.

121
00:12:53,340 --> 00:12:56,676
Hey listen, would you think any less of
me if I use a fork?

122
00:12:56,846 --> 00:13:01,346
I've been losing my strength here.
- I can't let that happen.

123
00:13:01,521 --> 00:13:03,515
Lie back. Give it to me.

124
00:13:04,610 --> 00:13:09,572
Lie back. That's right.
All the way back.

125
00:13:09,744 --> 00:13:13,198
Technique, huh?
- The expert.

126
00:13:13,375 --> 00:13:18,087
It's all in my hands, see?
Open. Open up.

127
00:13:19,552 --> 00:13:22,176
Good boy.
Delicious, huh?

128
00:13:30,404 --> 00:13:32,315
Delicious. More...

129
00:13:32,492 --> 00:13:35,449
Look, I think your strength
is returning.

130
00:13:36,541 --> 00:13:38,535
It's a miracle.

131
00:14:03,247 --> 00:14:04,081
Andy.

132
00:14:06,592 --> 00:14:09,001
What is it?
- He's there again.

133
00:14:10,641 --> 00:14:14,059
So?
- He's looking at us.

134
00:14:14,231 --> 00:14:21,117
Sounds like he's playing one of those electric keyboards.
- Jesus, it gives me the creeps.

135
00:14:21,285 --> 00:14:25,452
Be nice.
His mother works as a night nurse.

136
00:14:25,626 --> 00:14:28,249
Probably he is lonely.

137
00:14:35,142 --> 00:14:39,974
We gotta get some curtains up here.
It's a priority.

138
00:14:41,988 --> 00:14:47,413
Curtains are now the priority.
- Not until we decide what to paint.

139
00:14:48,541 --> 00:14:54,381
There is no point in painting if we
are going to break the house for the plumbing.

140
00:14:54,551 --> 00:14:58,599
So we are back to where we started.

141
00:15:28,863 --> 00:15:29,959
Oh Jeez !....

142
00:15:31,239 --> 00:15:32,776
Front door was wide open.
- Oh...

143
00:15:34,029 --> 00:15:35,489
You scared the hell out of me.

144
00:15:36,081 --> 00:15:38,159
I should have knocked but...
- Oh, no, no.

145
00:15:40,505 --> 00:15:44,921
Yeah... I have been working with a liquid paint remover.
Sometimes I get a headache from these odors.

146
00:15:45,097 --> 00:15:47,672
Oh, you should be taking a B Complex.
- Say again ?

147
00:15:47,853 --> 00:15:51,639
Well, a loading dose of a B-12
would help to enhance the cerebral cap....

148
00:15:52,735 --> 00:15:55,691
Never mind.
- No, no. why did you stop? That sounded great.

149
00:15:55,865 --> 00:16:00,281
Well, no it just occurred to me that I was suggesting you take a jar
of vitamins, you'd be smart not to leave the door open.

150
00:16:00,458 --> 00:16:03,377
Look at that. I saved myself $ 5.95.

151
00:16:03,546 --> 00:16:09,470
I was in the neighbourhood looking at some houses
and I thought I would take you and your wife out
for the lunch as promised.

152
00:16:09,639 --> 00:16:14,269
Well, Tracy is out to her class but I can get
cleaned up and we could go out ourselves.

153
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:17,277
Sounds good.
- Alright. Okay, I'll be right back.

154
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:30,756
So this is a real Victorian house, huh?
- Yeah, buried under a hundred years of paint.

155
00:16:30,927 --> 00:16:35,343
It was part of the underground rails
during the civil war.

156
00:16:36,228 --> 00:16:38,828
Lack of comfort makes up for the history.

157
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:45,275
You know anything about architecture? ?
- Architecture...oh architecture is my life.

158
00:16:45,452 --> 00:16:47,280
If I hadn't been a doctor, I'd have been...

159
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:52,003
... It'd have been a building.
Is this a Degas?

160
00:16:52,172 --> 00:16:55,757
Ya. I think it's original.
Tracy's father gave it to her.

161
00:17:02,045 --> 00:17:04,938
She's been having these abdominal pains.

162
00:17:06,071 --> 00:17:09,407
How often?
- Maybe once a week or all week days.

163
00:17:09,577 --> 00:17:12,783
How long do they last?
- Half a minute, sometimes even longer.

164
00:17:12,958 --> 00:17:18,502
Is she seeing someone?
- Yeah, a doctor in Boston named Lillianfield.

165
00:17:18,676 --> 00:17:23,757
David Lillianfield. Do you know him?
- I've heard of him.  Lillianfield is a good man.

166
00:17:25,063 --> 00:17:29,444
The thing is, we really wanna have kids.
Tracy is nuts about it.

167
00:17:29,612 --> 00:17:32,948
So am I.
- I'll tell you what.

168
00:17:34,246 --> 00:17:38,626
Give it another couple of weeks and if there
is no change, have a come by and see me.

169
00:17:39,036 --> 00:17:39,767
Alright.

170
00:17:40,108 --> 00:17:41,489
Hey Stanley...

171
00:17:42,593 --> 00:17:44,920
Hey Doc, it hurts when I do this.

172
00:17:45,097 --> 00:17:48,433
Then don't do that. And get some
new jokes, Stanley.

173
00:17:49,772 --> 00:17:55,316
So I told him 'why don't you come by and
look at ours and maybe we'd work out.'

174
00:17:56,576 --> 00:17:58,451
You did what?

175
00:17:58,621 --> 00:18:01,957
You're the one who wanted to rent it out.
I thought you'd be thrilled.

176
00:18:02,127 --> 00:18:07,506
Do I look thrilled?
- You're not thrilled. I can see that now but..

177
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:10,967
this is better than a visiting lecturer.
Jed is a friend.

178
00:18:11,143 --> 00:18:14,561
He's not a friend. He didn't even
remember your name, Alan.

179
00:18:14,733 --> 00:18:18,234
I mean, common the guy had just been
through twelve hours of surgery.

180
00:18:18,407 --> 00:18:22,454
What is it Andy? You want to relive the Highschool,
be friends with the quarterback this time?

181
00:18:22,621 --> 00:18:27,334
No, he was the running back.
And stop talking to me like I'm eleven.

182
00:18:27,506 --> 00:18:31,257
What's your problem with this guy?
I mean he's smart, he's funny....

183
00:18:31,428 --> 00:18:35,215
... and he's a brilliant doctor.
- I know. I know he's brilliant Andy...

184
00:18:35,394 --> 00:18:38,827
I can tell by the way the nurses seem to fall on
their knees when he walks down the hallway.

185
00:18:39,036 --> 00:18:42,480
I mean, this guy doesn't have friends,
he has subjects.

186
00:18:43,364 --> 00:18:44,149
Well....

187
00:18:45,202 --> 00:18:48,823
It's not too late, we
can call it off.

188
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:52,621
No, no. I'm leaving it up to you.

189
00:18:52,798 --> 00:18:58,141
If you want to live with that, it's your decision.
- You're gonna get to like him. You really will.

190
00:18:59,227 --> 00:19:00,323
And you know what else?

191
00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:04,079
We could even ask him to recommend
another doctor for you.

192
00:19:04,306 --> 00:19:05,561
Hello, what?

193
00:19:05,947 --> 00:19:11,622
If for no other reason, then it's nonsense to drive two hours
to see Lillianfield in Boston when we could just easily ...

194
00:19:11,791 --> 00:19:16,752
Andy, please tell me you didn't say anything to Jed.
Please tell me you didn't share my problems with him.

195
00:19:18,177 --> 00:19:20,171
It came up.

196
00:19:20,879 --> 00:19:22,027
It came up.

197
00:19:24,312 --> 00:19:28,527
I apologise.
- Alright.

198
00:19:28,695 --> 00:19:30,584
I will go along with this
for a few months ...

199
00:19:31,001 --> 00:19:32,931
Only because I want the sofa...

200
00:19:33,923 --> 00:19:35,279
... combining with the stairs.

201
00:19:39,756 --> 00:19:42,249
Oh my God, is he moving in tonight?

202
00:19:42,427 --> 00:19:46,262
You're assuming it's Jed?
- Oh, I'm quite certain it's Jed. Open the door.

203
00:19:46,434 --> 00:19:50,898
It could be anyone.
- The angels could dance on pins, but they do not. It's Jed.

204
00:19:53,154 --> 00:19:56,656
What makes you so sure?
- You want to bet me?

205
00:19:57,870 --> 00:19:58,862
No.

206
00:19:59,540 --> 00:20:03,077
Because once money is involved,
you take me seriously, right?

207
00:20:04,319 --> 00:20:04,862
Hello.

208
00:20:05,676 --> 00:20:08,251
Dr. Hill. Please come in.

209
00:20:10,143 --> 00:20:13,146
Andy just got through telling me,
we're gonna be roommates.

210
00:20:13,315 --> 00:20:16,852
Well, that's why I stopped by.
I just wanted to make sure that it was really okay.

211
00:20:17,030 --> 00:20:20,879
Don't be silly. I'm looking forward to it.
- She is. She is really looking forward to it.

212
00:20:21,401 --> 00:20:22,444
Excellent.

213
00:20:35,435 --> 00:20:40,392
The mid-term was at 8:30. I set my alarm for 7
& it didn't go off.

214
00:20:40,496 --> 00:20:44,115
I mean if Professor Schmidt wants to give
me an incomplete, then I really don't care.

215
00:20:44,284 --> 00:20:48,783
I can't control everything in this world.
My alarm didn't go off.

216
00:20:48,959 --> 00:20:51,870
That's good.
That's very good, Paula.

217
00:20:52,026 --> 00:20:56,845
That's so much better than locking your copy of
Beowulf in your friend's car.

218
00:20:57,705 --> 00:20:58,548
Thank You.

219
00:20:59,957 --> 00:21:00,792
Yeah.

220
00:21:00,948 --> 00:21:04,061
Detective Harris wishes to see you.
- Really.

221
00:21:04,236 --> 00:21:06,277
I'm amazed she could find the building.

222
00:21:06,448 --> 00:21:09,820
We'll have to continue this next week if you don't mind.
- Fine.

223
00:21:13,052 --> 00:21:17,792
Hang on, Paula. Hi Dana, go on in.
It will be just a second.

224
00:21:17,968 --> 00:21:21,713
Mrs. Worthington, I want you to note all test and
exam times for Ms. Paula Bell.

225
00:21:21,818 --> 00:21:25,731
She's to receive wake up calls from this office.
- Wake up calls?

226
00:21:25,991 --> 00:21:31,398
She can't be expected to control the world, Mrs. Worthington.
Her alarm didn't go off.

227
00:21:31,575 --> 00:21:33,735
I'll see you next week, Paula.

228
00:21:37,574 --> 00:21:39,087
Sorry.
- Jesus !

229
00:21:41,092 --> 00:21:43,300
She able to give any kind of description ?

230
00:21:43,471 --> 00:21:46,427
All she remembers is her cat crouching
under a chair...

231
00:21:46,601 --> 00:21:50,222
... and an arm grabbing her from behind.

232
00:21:50,399 --> 00:21:52,690
Is there any chance she'll remember more?

233
00:21:52,862 --> 00:21:54,061
I don't think so.

234
00:21:54,635 --> 00:21:55,365
So...

235
00:21:56,326 --> 00:21:59,532
What do we do now?
- We ?

236
00:21:59,708 --> 00:22:03,210
'We' don't do anything Andy.
Only one of us is a police detective.

237
00:22:03,380 --> 00:22:05,873
Maybe not even that many.

238
00:22:06,052 --> 00:22:09,388
Oh... college wit.
Let me search my mind for a clever answer.

239
00:22:09,557 --> 00:22:12,097
How about 'bite me' ?

240
00:22:12,272 --> 00:22:14,064
Touché.

241
00:22:14,233 --> 00:22:16,905
We have ordered more ''Security Precautions'' pamphlets.

242
00:22:17,071 --> 00:22:19,315
More pamphlets?
- That's right.

243
00:22:19,492 --> 00:22:23,244
Do you know what I see when I come
to work every morning?

244
00:22:24,251 --> 00:22:30,839
I see fathers loading trunks, suitcases, plants
and daughters in their station wagons.

245
00:22:31,011 --> 00:22:35,677
Presumably to drive them off to school so that
they don't pose quite as high a death threat.

246
00:22:35,854 --> 00:22:38,608
See, I don't think I'm being unreasonable
when I ask...

247
00:22:38,776 --> 00:22:40,996
... what you and your crack-team of professionals are doing

248
00:22:41,226 --> 00:22:44,043
other than distributing literature to repress this situation.

249
00:22:45,411 --> 00:22:47,747
I need a list of anyone who had access to
the students' schedules.

250
00:22:47,904 --> 00:22:52,120
Both victims were inside the class
when our guy got in.

251
00:22:52,299 --> 00:22:55,836
So you have narrowed it down to a couple
of thousand people.

252
00:22:56,014 --> 00:22:59,551
A list, Andy.
I need it, now.

253
00:23:01,522 --> 00:23:02,731
Dana...

254
00:23:03,359 --> 00:23:06,373
What do you think he does with the hair?
- The hair ?

255
00:23:06,864 --> 00:23:10,404
Yeah, he gets off all the hair.
What do you think he does with it?

256
00:23:10,581 --> 00:23:13,418
Perhaps makes pillows. Who knows?

257
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:21,712
Billy, I want you in bed by 10,
you hear me?

258
00:24:18,783 --> 00:24:23,329
You scared the shit out of me.
- I'm sorry about that.

259
00:24:23,500 --> 00:24:25,494
What the hell are you doing here?

260
00:24:28,174 --> 00:24:31,546
Are you alright?
- No, I'm not alright.

261
00:24:31,722 --> 00:24:33,597
Anybody home?

262
00:24:37,148 --> 00:24:39,189
Up here, honey.

263
00:24:57,725 --> 00:25:00,764
This is ridiculous.
- Go to sleep.

264
00:25:00,939 --> 00:25:04,026
Who the hell can sleep
with them doing that all night?

265
00:25:04,195 --> 00:25:06,189
It's been like three hours.

266
00:25:06,365 --> 00:25:08,136
I'll ask him to turn it down.

267
00:25:08,872 --> 00:25:15,000
No, I don't want to make a big thing about it.
- No, if you can't fall asleep...

268
00:25:20,473 --> 00:25:24,260
You think maybe he heard us?
- I hope so.

269
00:25:25,690 --> 00:25:28,444
Where're you going?
- To the bathroom.

270
00:25:36,877 --> 00:25:40,463
I know why guys like you become doctors.

271
00:25:40,634 --> 00:25:42,628
It's not what you yhink.

272
00:25:42,803 --> 00:25:47,765
I think it's to make a lot of money
& see a lot of naked women.

273
00:25:47,913 --> 00:25:49,061
Oh.. well..

274
00:25:49,483 --> 00:25:51,607
Then it is what you think.

275
00:25:56,370 --> 00:26:01,035
Hey, ease yourself.
I'm not done with you yet.

276
00:26:01,211 --> 00:26:04,417
I am immune to alcohol.
- Yeah?

277
00:26:04,592 --> 00:26:07,001
We'll see about that.

278
00:26:15,763 --> 00:26:16,841
Tracy.

279
00:26:24,835 --> 00:26:26,794
You alright?

280
00:26:30,971 --> 00:26:33,012
Ya, I'll be right there.

281
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:46,821
You worried me for a second.
- No, I'm fine.

282
00:26:57,934 --> 00:27:00,059
Come on, let's go to bed.

283
00:27:27,903 --> 00:27:29,446
hey, how you there, old man?

284
00:27:29,615 --> 00:27:31,740
Six miles a day keeps the doctor away.

285
00:27:31,911 --> 00:27:35,781
Want some coffee?
- No, never touch in the morning.

286
00:27:35,959 --> 00:27:38,535
You okay, Tracy ?
- I'm fine.

287
00:27:38,714 --> 00:27:43,795
Well, I'll grab quick shower, fly over to the
hospital. I'll catch you guys later.

288
00:28:04,133 --> 00:28:06,673
Are you sure she didn't call to
cancel her appointment?

289
00:28:06,846 --> 00:28:10,432
Yes, I'm sure that I called her
yesterday to remind her.

290
00:28:10,603 --> 00:28:13,522
Did you try calling her again?
- Nobody's there, professor.

291
00:28:13,691 --> 00:28:16,897
I keep getting her answering machine.
- She's there.

292
00:28:17,072 --> 00:28:19,197
She's not answering it.

293
00:28:42,476 --> 00:28:43,362
Paula?

294
00:30:31,348 --> 00:30:33,971
I'm gonna need a statement.

295
00:30:37,988 --> 00:30:38,979
Andy...

296
00:30:46,499 --> 00:30:49,362
You wanna hear about the first time I
ever saw a corpse?

297
00:30:50,718 --> 00:30:51,449
No.

298
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:55,309
It was my first year of medical
school, ghost anatomy.

299
00:30:55,518 --> 00:30:59,351
The instructor begin cutting the corpse's head.

300
00:30:59,522 --> 00:31:02,727
People were running out of the room.
Some fainted there.

301
00:31:02,902 --> 00:31:05,905
I tell you, it really didn't bother me over that much though.

302
00:31:06,618 --> 00:31:08,113
It's a great story Jed.

303
00:31:08,287 --> 00:31:12,869
Of course, I'm not looking forward to
the same thing but....

304
00:31:14,405 --> 00:31:18,633
Hey, You'll get over it.

305
00:31:26,527 --> 00:31:31,870
Hey Stanley, who the hell is that in the backfield?
Livelle or something. He's off the bench (reserve).

306
00:31:32,036 --> 00:31:36,583
What happened to Krakowski?
- Funked the piss test.

307
00:31:38,339 --> 00:31:40,499
That upsets me.

308
00:31:41,596 --> 00:31:46,012
Guy can't stay off of cocaine even for one
million dollars.

309
00:31:47,104 --> 00:31:49,893
Man, I'll give my right arm for
one million dollars.

310
00:31:50,069 --> 00:31:53,191
We cannot afford plumbing for Christ's sake.

311
00:31:54,785 --> 00:31:57,125
Would you really?
- What?

312
00:31:57,664 --> 00:32:00,751
give your right arm for one million dollars?

313
00:32:03,300 --> 00:32:05,793
You mean like, literally?
- Yeah.

314
00:32:07,307 --> 00:32:11,806
Well, not even an arm.
Let's just say a finger.

315
00:32:13,859 --> 00:32:20,863
One finger, for one milion dollars?
Oh god, this is a strange conversation.

316
00:32:21,038 --> 00:32:24,076
What we're talking about is a surgical procedure just...

317
00:32:24,253 --> 00:32:27,671
...to the joint.
Would you do it ?

318
00:32:30,474 --> 00:32:31,538
No.

319
00:32:33,435 --> 00:32:34,491
Really?

320
00:32:36,213 --> 00:32:37,048
Would you?

321
00:32:42,265 --> 00:32:43,413
No.

322
00:32:48,669 --> 00:32:53,001
I should be getting back
Jed let me....

323
00:32:54,430 --> 00:32:59,179
Hey, stay for one more drink with me.
- Tracy's gonna be home.

324
00:32:59,691 --> 00:33:01,048
I'll see you.
- Yeah.

325
00:33:09,709 --> 00:33:10,543
Stanley.

326
00:33:11,752 --> 00:33:16,168
Would you please bring those two girls
a round of whatever it is they're drinking?

327
00:33:16,344 --> 00:33:19,466
Bourbon.
- Bourbon it is.

328
00:33:32,706 --> 00:33:35,828
Got a minute?
- Sure.

329
00:33:37,088 --> 00:33:42,003
This... is the living room here.
Take a seat.

330
00:33:44,309 --> 00:33:47,645
I just need you to clear up a few things for me.
- Like what?

331
00:33:50,777 --> 00:33:54,196
Paula Bell came to see you 3 times, is that right?
- That's right.

332
00:33:54,368 --> 00:33:58,950
It would have been four times only....
- What is this?

333
00:33:59,126 --> 00:34:04,670
Last night we matched the soil sample taken from
Paula Bell's carpet to a sample taken from your yard.

334
00:34:04,844 --> 00:34:07,764
I went inside, I told you that.

335
00:34:07,933 --> 00:34:11,803
We also matched it to a sample
taken from Bridget Kelly's room.

336
00:34:11,982 --> 00:34:14,612
Bridget came by here to pick up a
letter of recommendation.

337
00:34:15,552 --> 00:34:17,117
Am I a suspect, Dana?

338
00:34:17,501 --> 00:34:19,035
Am I a fucking suspect?

339
00:34:19,620 --> 00:34:22,908
All three victims had been in to see you
before they were attacked.

340
00:34:23,084 --> 00:34:25,375
I found Paula, for Christ's sake.

341
00:34:25,547 --> 00:34:28,799
What was it that made you go to her house?
- She missed her appointment.

342
00:34:28,970 --> 00:34:32,979
So you went to her house?
- Yes, because she was a screw-up & I've a responsibility.

343
00:34:33,291 --> 00:34:35,888
What's your blood type, Andy ?
- O+ve.

344
00:34:36,065 --> 00:34:39,816
See, as luck would have it, you have the same
blood type as the perpetrator.

345
00:34:40,531 --> 00:34:46,538
Dana, this is crazy. In my entire life
I've never harmed anyone.

346
00:34:46,709 --> 00:34:50,661
I believe you.
I don't think you're the guy.

347
00:34:51,170 --> 00:34:51,823
Thank you.

348
00:34:55,390 --> 00:35:01,184
I need you to do something for me. It's procedural,
I wouldn't be doing my job if I didn't ask you to do it.

349
00:35:01,191 --> 00:35:01,678
Do what?

350
00:35:02,319 --> 00:35:07,115
I need a sperm sample to test
against the one taken from the victims.

351
00:35:07,286 --> 00:35:10,622
I don't believe this.
- It's a simple thing Andy. Maybe in an hour

352
00:35:10,792 --> 00:35:13,997
... you'll be eliminated as a suspect.

353
00:35:15,342 --> 00:35:16,595
What if I refuse?

354
00:35:18,212 --> 00:35:19,725
Give the way to my handcuffs.

355
00:35:26,820 --> 00:35:28,595
Damn.
- No, no. It's much better.

356
00:35:29,273 --> 00:35:30,473
No, it's not.
- No, it is.

357
00:35:30,284 --> 00:35:34,035
At least you did not hit the
innocent bystanders (people) again.

358
00:35:40,385 --> 00:35:42,213
Beautiful.

359
00:35:46,125 --> 00:35:46,803
Andy.

360
00:35:49,151 --> 00:35:50,403
Andy.

361
00:36:47,628 --> 00:36:49,088
911 Emergency.

362
00:36:50,883 --> 00:36:55,516
I'll show you the rotating muscle
if you don't mind, it's right in here okay...

363
00:36:56,350 --> 00:37:00,682
...if it tears, you cannot comb hair, let
alone throw the ball.

364
00:37:03,070 --> 00:37:06,263
That thing's been beeping all night.
Are you a drug dealer?

365
00:37:06,576 --> 00:37:08,988
Yeah, you can say that.

366
00:37:09,290 --> 00:37:10,594
Stanley.

367
00:37:15,593 --> 00:37:17,088
Somebody, talk to me.

368
00:37:17,262 --> 00:37:19,098
We've got massive haemorrhaging.
It's probably an ovary.

369
00:37:19,568 --> 00:37:20,768
We'll have some more numbers in a few minutes.

370
00:37:21,228 --> 00:37:23,982
Blood type.
- AB negative. We need more.

371
00:37:24,150 --> 00:37:29,029
Tanya, get a hold of the Mass General, Boston, and
Mercy Hartford. If they're low, we're gonna need donors.

372
00:37:37,214 --> 00:37:41,546
I'm sorry we had to put you through this, Andy.
You can go home now.

373
00:37:43,359 --> 00:37:44,037
Andy.

374
00:37:47,689 --> 00:37:50,037
Mr. Safian...
- Yeah.

375
00:37:54,494 --> 00:37:59,040
Your wife's name came up on a 911.
It's a medical emergency.

376
00:37:59,210 --> 00:38:02,748
David, what's the blood pressure?
- 93 above 57.

377
00:38:02,925 --> 00:38:04,468
Heart rate ?
- 86.

378
00:38:04,636 --> 00:38:06,381
Capacity ?
- 27.

379
00:38:06,556 --> 00:38:10,058
Jed, did you see this ?

380
00:38:13,569 --> 00:38:16,276
Four to five weeks would be my guess.

381
00:38:18,827 --> 00:38:22,080
She is pregnant ?
- Not for long.

382
00:38:22,250 --> 00:38:26,001
Her foetus got aborted from the trauma
of the procedure.

383
00:38:35,356 --> 00:38:37,730
Whenever you're ready, doctor.

384
00:38:41,741 --> 00:38:42,837
Dr. Hill...

385
00:38:48,295 --> 00:38:50,123
Alright, let's begin.

386
00:38:54,639 --> 00:38:56,930
Scalpel.
- Scalpel.

387
00:39:07,515 --> 00:39:08,610
Mr. Safian.
- Yeah.

388
00:39:08,873 --> 00:39:12,079
What happened to my wife?
- She's bleeding internally.

389
00:39:12,254 --> 00:39:16,302
Dr. Hill will come and talk to you
soon as her condition is stabilized.

390
00:39:16,470 --> 00:39:20,387
Is she conscious?
- I'm sorry Mr. Safian, that's all I know.

391
00:39:28,032 --> 00:39:32,245
We're almost done. I just wanna have one last
look around. Check for rings and watches. Suction.

392
00:39:33,028 --> 00:39:33,810
Suction.

393
00:39:40,344 --> 00:39:44,349
Well, I think we've got it all.
It's amazing it didn't erupt so sooner.

394
00:39:48,210 --> 00:39:48,836
Jed.

395
00:39:50,529 --> 00:39:53,781
You got some pathology in the second ovary.

396
00:39:58,334 --> 00:40:01,290
Let me have a look in here. Harrington.
- Harrington.

397
00:40:02,925 --> 00:40:04,884
It was twisted when I unpacked it.

398
00:40:07,475 --> 00:40:09,802
Think it's necrotic ?

399
00:40:09,979 --> 00:40:13,682
Alright I want to do a frozen section right away,
see if we still get a viable ovary here.

400
00:40:13,862 --> 00:40:15,184
We can't.
- Why not?

401
00:40:15,340 --> 00:40:18,106
The pathologist is not present.
- Then what do I do for frozen section?

402
00:40:18,495 --> 00:40:20,558
We can call him in.
- How long would that take?

403
00:40:20,576 --> 00:40:23,636
30-40 minutes.
Hell, then I'd get a microscope and do it myself.

404
00:40:23,793 --> 00:40:27,549
It'll take at least a half an hour
for the processor to warm up.

405
00:40:27,719 --> 00:40:29,844
What's the pressure ?
- 78.

406
00:40:30,014 --> 00:40:33,884
I don't have that kind of time.
- You got maybe fifteen minutes.

407
00:40:35,524 --> 00:40:40,867
Alright. Irrigate and try to get the BP
back up. I'll be right back.

408
00:40:46,919 --> 00:40:49,839
Come with me.
- What's going on?

409
00:40:59,816 --> 00:41:03,069
I had to remove one of Tracy's ovaries.

410
00:41:03,239 --> 00:41:08,485
It ruptured. A large cyst had developed in
that what was causing her pain.

411
00:41:08,664 --> 00:41:11,786
I've to be direct with you
because we're little under the gun.

412
00:41:11,962 --> 00:41:14,716
Is it under control?
- Not yet.

413
00:41:14,884 --> 00:41:18,386
There is a problem with Tracy's second ovary.

414
00:41:18,557 --> 00:41:22,807
We discovered it was torsed or twisted
around in its own blood supply.

415
00:41:22,981 --> 00:41:25,605
If I remove it, I'm simply
removing a dead organ...

416
00:41:25,778 --> 00:41:30,075
... and in all likely Tracy will lead a
normal healthy life.

417
00:41:30,244 --> 00:41:32,238
But...

418
00:41:34,334 --> 00:41:38,335
... she won't ever be able to have children.

419
00:41:38,509 --> 00:41:43,852
If I close her up now, she could die of
toxic-shock in the middle of the night.

420
00:41:47,106 --> 00:41:52,650
Do whatever you have to do.
- Tracy's gonna be fine.

421
00:41:52,801 --> 00:41:53,583
Yeah.

422
00:41:54,452 --> 00:41:57,325
But what?
- I'll tell you later.

423
00:41:57,499 --> 00:41:59,743
No.
No, tell me now.

424
00:42:10,063 --> 00:42:13,565
Tracy was pregnant.
Of four weeks.

425
00:42:13,737 --> 00:42:18,983
Tracy is pregnant ?
- No Andy. The foetus aborted (dead).

426
00:42:19,163 --> 00:42:22,998
She sustained a lot of trauma.
There was nothing that could be done.

427
00:42:24,756 --> 00:42:26,750
I'm sorry about it.

428
00:42:54,265 --> 00:42:55,974
Artery clamp.

429
00:42:56,144 --> 00:43:00,524
Dr. Hill, I think this might be a mistake.
How do you know it's not still viable?

430
00:43:00,693 --> 00:43:05,193
This is the wife of a friend.
I'll not take any chances. Scalpel.

431
00:43:05,368 --> 00:43:09,036
You could be taking out a viable ovary.

432
00:43:10,460 --> 00:43:15,838
It's necrotic. Scalpel.
- Without the histology, you can't be sure.

433
00:43:16,011 --> 00:43:17,922
I'm sure.

434
00:43:18,098 --> 00:43:21,933
Tanya, give me the scalpel.

435
00:44:05,843 --> 00:44:06,730
Jed.

436
00:44:12,860 --> 00:44:16,694
What you got there, George ?
- It's from pathology.

437
00:44:19,372 --> 00:44:22,410
Are they Histology report ?

438
00:44:23,586 --> 00:44:26,293
We took out a healthy ovary.

439
00:44:26,467 --> 00:44:29,921
Only the surface was necrotic.

440
00:44:30,991 --> 00:44:33,929
Jed, take this.

441
00:44:36,109 --> 00:44:37,356
Look at it.

442
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:39,913
Then burn it.

443
00:44:44,666 --> 00:44:47,039
That's a nice gesture, George.
Really.

444
00:44:47,212 --> 00:44:51,164
The technician owes me a favour.
Lab won't be a problem.

445
00:44:51,344 --> 00:44:52,970
It'll be a problem for me.

446
00:44:53,140 --> 00:44:56,594
This hospital took out a healthy ovary.

447
00:44:56,770 --> 00:45:00,307
I took out the ovary.
No one else.

448
00:45:00,485 --> 00:45:05,114
It was a judgement call and
I stand by it.

449
00:45:09,333 --> 00:45:13,714
Are you gonna be alright?
- I'll be fine.

450
00:45:15,552 --> 00:45:18,425
I didn't do anything wrong.

451
00:45:38,969 --> 00:45:43,681
I figured you probably hadn't eaten anything in a while.
- We should talk later, okay?

452
00:45:45,145 --> 00:45:50,903
Well, Andy, I wanted to have a word with Tracy.
Maybe later, okay? Jed...

453
00:45:51,073 --> 00:45:56,284
Hello, Mrs. Safian. You gave
us quite a scare.

454
00:45:56,456 --> 00:45:58,367
Did I?

455
00:45:59,546 --> 00:46:01,982
Tracy, I know you've been told
all about what's happened.

456
00:46:02,921 --> 00:46:03,703
Yes.

457
00:46:04,597 --> 00:46:08,431
I don't know if there's any point in telling
you how sorry I am.

458
00:46:08,603 --> 00:46:12,438
I spoke with a lawyer this morning.

459
00:46:12,610 --> 00:46:16,231
I want to make sure you don't
do this to someone else.

460
00:46:33,814 --> 00:46:36,567
The legal statements will be in a week.

461
00:46:36,735 --> 00:46:39,489
I think we can bring them down from
the 30 million in a settlement.

462
00:46:39,657 --> 00:46:44,655
Let's not dick each other around here.
30 million, 25 million, what difference does it make?

463
00:46:44,834 --> 00:46:49,048
You know anything over 10 million dollars
& I can't get insurance in this or any other state.

464
00:46:49,215 --> 00:46:51,077
I say we go to a jury.
- I cannot recommend that.

465
00:46:51,233 --> 00:46:51,912
Why not?

466
00:46:52,262 --> 00:46:54,720
Let me tell you what a jury sees.

467
00:46:54,893 --> 00:46:58,941
A jury sees a beautiful young woman
married to a mild-mannered teacher.

468
00:46:59,107 --> 00:47:02,561
They buy an old house and dream of
filling it up with children.

469
00:47:02,740 --> 00:47:07,868
Now that is a honey-sweet painting and you
have ripped it to shreds with your scalpel.

470
00:47:08,040 --> 00:47:09,964
You're my lawyer.
Am I right here?

471
00:47:10,120 --> 00:47:11,894
It's not my job to hold your hand, doctor.

472
00:47:12,215 --> 00:47:15,546
It's not your job to be an asshole either counsellor
but that doesn't seem to be stopping here.

473
00:47:15,859 --> 00:47:18,174
Maybe if we all calm down.

474
00:47:19,309 --> 00:47:22,431
We could bring in a private investigator,
dig up something on her background.

475
00:47:22,607 --> 00:47:26,026
Lester, she volunteered five days a week
in a children's ward.

476
00:47:26,196 --> 00:47:28,736
And baked cookies for the staff.

477
00:47:28,910 --> 00:47:31,237
Looks like you picked the
wrong patient to screw up on, doctor.

478
00:47:31,414 --> 00:47:36,625
I didn't pick her, counsellor.
Physicians don't get to choose.

479
00:47:36,799 --> 00:47:40,170
I'll need an ''expert''.
Who do you want to call?

480
00:47:40,345 --> 00:47:43,931
What do you mean?
- An expert. Someone to make a statement.

481
00:47:44,103 --> 00:47:48,602
A statement saying what?
- A statement saying that you're as good as you think you are.

482
00:47:53,202 --> 00:47:57,417
Call Dr. Marvin Kessler.
Harvard Medical School.

483
00:47:58,503 --> 00:47:59,163
Is that it Miss?

484
00:47:59,946 --> 00:48:00,624
Yes.

485
00:48:04,764 --> 00:48:07,616
How will I get in touch with you?
- You won't.

486
00:48:08,562 --> 00:48:10,686
I don't want you to.

487
00:48:11,777 --> 00:48:15,908
Tracy, why won't you let me help you
get through this?

488
00:48:16,075 --> 00:48:18,615
This isn't a phase, Andy.

489
00:48:19,706 --> 00:48:23,956
I can't have children. Ever.

490
00:48:24,131 --> 00:48:26,884
He thought you were going to die.

491
00:48:27,052 --> 00:48:29,343
Right about now he's wishing I did.

492
00:48:30,447 --> 00:48:33,811
Tracy, I love you.

493
00:48:35,525 --> 00:48:37,511
He took my insights out...

494
00:48:38,294 --> 00:48:40,902
And you gave him permission.

495
00:48:45,947 --> 00:48:47,372
Goodbye, Andy.

496
00:49:06,621 --> 00:49:10,621
Dr. Kessler, would you describe your history
& relationship to Dr. Hill?

497
00:49:10,796 --> 00:49:14,463
Dr. Hill was a student of mine at medical school.

498
00:49:14,636 --> 00:49:20,096
From graduation I asked him to serve his
residency under my direction at Mass General.

499
00:49:20,270 --> 00:49:25,185
And when he finished the residency,
I asked him to join our surgical staff.

500
00:49:25,362 --> 00:49:28,983
Dr. Kessler, how long you've been teaching at Harvard Medical school?
- 21 years.

501
00:49:29,161 --> 00:49:32,330
How long you've been chief of staff at Mass General ?
- 14 years.

502
00:49:32,500 --> 00:49:36,417
So you've been in a position to work with thousands of young doctors.
Am I correct?
-Yes.

503
00:49:36,590 --> 00:49:42,099
I might add that the doctors are there a pleasure to teach
& work with are among the very best in the world.

504
00:49:42,267 --> 00:49:47,893
And how would Dr. Hill rank in this group that
are among the very best in the world?
- There is no one any better.

505
00:49:48,519 --> 00:49:49,687
Thank You.

506
00:49:50,345 --> 00:49:51,337
Mr. Riley.

507
00:49:52,743 --> 00:49:56,791
Dr. Kessler, your faith in Dr. Hill's surgical talent is obvious.

508
00:49:56,960 --> 00:49:58,918
And completely deserved.

509
00:49:59,087 --> 00:50:02,791
Dr. Kessler, seven months ago the position of Chief
of Surgery became available on Mass General.

510
00:50:02,969 --> 00:50:05,129
Did you had Jed Hill seek this position?
- Yes, he did.

511
00:50:05,307 --> 00:50:09,438
Did you give the position to Jed?
- Excuse me, my client's name is Dr. Hill.

512
00:50:09,606 --> 00:50:13,938
Forgive me, did you award the position to Dr. Hill?  - No.
Why not?

513
00:50:14,113 --> 00:50:17,449
Well, he was certainly qualified...
- But you didn't give him the job.

514
00:50:17,620 --> 00:50:19,495
There were many other candidates.

515
00:50:19,665 --> 00:50:22,953
Surgeons more qualified?
- This isn't the trial, Mr. Riley.

516
00:50:23,129 --> 00:50:27,260
Dr. Kessler, during Dr. Hill's residency in Mass General
you wrote several co-orderly valuations.

517
00:50:27,429 --> 00:50:31,216
The valuations to be read and
reviewed by hospital administrators...

518
00:50:31,393 --> 00:50:33,767
... department heads.
- Yes.

519
00:50:33,939 --> 00:50:41,276
I'm looking at one... right now dated
June 15th, 1982 & bearing your signature.

520
00:50:41,452 --> 00:50:43,245
It's coming up.

521
00:50:47,005 --> 00:50:53,213
I'd like to read fom page 3, paragraph 4...

522
00:50:53,390 --> 00:50:56,393
While Jed Hill consistently remains the
most skilled and the brightest of our residents...

523
00:50:56,563 --> 00:51:02,107
... we should not ignore what the authorities of this
college observed that he suffers from "God Complex".

524
00:51:02,281 --> 00:51:06,116
'God-Complex'. That's not a typo, was it?
It says 'God-Complex'.

525
00:51:07,332 --> 00:51:12,163
That was read nearly a decade ago.
- What's a 'God-Complex' ?

526
00:51:12,340 --> 00:51:14,963
How did you get this information? This was priviledged...
- Dr. Kessler...

527
00:51:15,137 --> 00:51:16,881
What's a 'God-Complex' ?

528
00:51:17,057 --> 00:51:21,936
It's a term that has no clinical meaning... at all.
Doctors throw it around...

529
00:51:22,107 --> 00:51:23,684
Sir, with all due respect, but knock it off.

530
00:51:23,736 --> 00:51:27,075
What did you mean in this evaluation when
you said Dr. Hill had a 'God-Complex' ?

531
00:51:27,825 --> 00:51:34,200
The power to heal can be an enormous thing,
an enormous thing...

532
00:51:34,378 --> 00:51:38,379
to save a life. To get blood flowing into cells
and vital organs.

533
00:51:38,552 --> 00:51:44,809
If a person can do that... And if one can do it
as exceptionally as Dr. Hill...

534
00:51:44,980 --> 00:51:50,405
... it's not uncommon for a person like that
to begin to believe that he can do anything.

535
00:51:50,574 --> 00:51:54,789
The power to heal can be like a drug.

536
00:51:54,957 --> 00:51:55,823
'Like a drug', you're saying ?

537
00:51:56,084 --> 00:52:00,362
Would it've been uncommon for a person with a
'God-complex' to reject the advice of others?

538
00:52:01,186 --> 00:52:02,260
No.

539
00:52:02,511 --> 00:52:04,744
Would it've been uncommon for such a person to....

540
00:52:05,110 --> 00:52:08,918
proceed on a course that others might reject
if only out of a sense of a God like power?

541
00:52:09,398 --> 00:52:11,143
Oh, now I think you're vastly overstating.

542
00:52:11,318 --> 00:52:15,188
Is that why you didn't give Dr. Hill the job?
- There were a number of other factors.

543
00:52:15,367 --> 00:52:18,204
Is that why you removed a healthy ovary
without any scientific diagnosis?

544
00:52:18,371 --> 00:52:22,324
Don't you address my client, Mr. Riley.
- Do you have a 'God-complex' ?

545
00:52:22,503 --> 00:52:24,988
This is not acceptable.
- No, no. Let him address me.

546
00:52:25,301 --> 00:52:29,174
Jed.
-No, No. It's about time I got to give some answers here.

547
00:52:29,349 --> 00:52:32,306
Stop typing.
This is off the record.

548
00:52:34,275 --> 00:52:40,733
The question is, do I have a 'God-complex'.
- Dr. Kessler says yes.

549
00:52:40,911 --> 00:52:48,414
which makes me wonder if this lawyer has any idea...

550
00:52:48,591 --> 00:52:51,547
... as to the kind of grades one has
to receive in college...

551
00:52:51,720 --> 00:52:54,973
... to be accepted at a top medical school.

552
00:52:55,144 --> 00:52:58,598
If you have the vaguest clue as to
how talented someone has to be...

553
00:52:58,775 --> 00:53:02,823
... to lead a surgical team.

554
00:53:02,991 --> 00:53:05,662
I have an M.D. from Harvard,

555
00:53:05,829 --> 00:53:10,578
I am board certified in cardio-thoracic medicine
and trauma surgery,

556
00:53:10,754 --> 00:53:15,004
I have been awarded citations from seven
different medical boards in New England,

557
00:53:15,179 --> 00:53:19,096
and I am never, ever sick at sea.

558
00:53:19,269 --> 00:53:21,560
So I ask you:

559
00:53:21,732 --> 00:53:26,029
when someone goes into that chapel and they
fall on their knees and they pray to God...

560
00:53:26,198 --> 00:53:30,448
...that their wife doesn't miscarry or that their
daughter doesn't bleed to death...

561
00:53:30,622 --> 00:53:36,131
...or that their mother doesn't suffer acute
neural trauma from post-operative shock,

562
00:53:36,300 --> 00:53:38,175
...who do you think they're praying to?

563
00:53:40,766 --> 00:53:46,108
Now, go ahead and read your Bible, Dennis,
and you go to your church,

564
00:53:46,274 --> 00:53:51,189
and, with any luck, you might win the annual raffle,
but if you're looking for God:

565
00:53:51,367 --> 00:53:54,953
he was in operating room number two on November 17,

566
00:53:55,123 --> 00:53:58,660
and he doesn't like to be second guessed.

567
00:53:59,924 --> 00:54:04,304
You ask me if I have a 'God complex'.
Let me tell you something:

568
00:54:04,472 --> 00:54:06,550
I am God.

569
00:54:08,063 --> 00:54:10,936
This sideshow is over.

570
00:54:19,916 --> 00:54:22,835
You got a winner here, Lester.

571
00:54:23,005 --> 00:54:26,626
Call my office, in the morning
and we'll work out a settlement.

572
00:54:26,804 --> 00:54:29,973
It gets better.
- What do you mean?

573
00:54:30,143 --> 00:54:33,645
We talked to the bartender of a
place called Prince William Tavern.

574
00:54:33,816 --> 00:54:38,861
Ask 'God' how many shots of bourbon he had before he cut me open.

575
00:54:44,877 --> 00:54:48,711
The insurance company will be drafting
to my firm's account by sometime next week...

576
00:54:48,883 --> 00:54:52,635
So if you sign right away, you should get
your money few days after that.

577
00:54:52,807 --> 00:54:55,893
Listen there are some things we
should discuss now that can embroil a policy.

578
00:54:56,064 --> 00:54:59,981
Dennis, this isn't such a good time for me.
- We're talking about 20 million dollars.

579
00:55:00,154 --> 00:55:03,157
Dennis, I think about what I want for breakfast,
I start crying.

580
00:55:03,326 --> 00:55:06,863
You could put the money in a coffee pot,
for all I care.

581
00:55:45,315 --> 00:55:48,817
It's 8:30.
- I'll see you tomorrow.

582
00:55:48,987 --> 00:55:53,202
You should go home.
- I'll see you tomorrow.

583
00:56:02,699 --> 00:56:04,065
Mrs. Worthington.

584
00:56:05,630 --> 00:56:07,038
Mrs. Worthington.

585
00:57:09,803 --> 00:57:11,264
Mr. Leemus.

586
00:57:22,325 --> 00:57:23,994
Mr. Leemus.

587
00:58:16,768 --> 00:58:17,840
Christ!

588
00:58:19,333 --> 00:58:21,243
You surprised me. Holy Shi...

589
00:58:21,420 --> 00:58:25,836
I was working on the front.
I didn't know anybody else was here.

590
00:58:26,012 --> 00:58:29,965
I saw the lights...
- It's my mother's hair.

591
00:58:30,144 --> 00:58:33,896
She's not alive anymore.
That's her in the picture.

592
00:58:37,115 --> 00:58:40,403
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to get any of your things. I..
- No, that's okay.

593
00:58:41,998 --> 00:58:46,379
I came down to get a light,
I didn't realize...

594
00:58:49,052 --> 00:58:52,720
You live down here?
- No, no. Just for a while.

595
00:58:52,891 --> 00:58:56,476
My landlady asked me to leave.

596
00:58:56,647 --> 00:58:59,021
I won't stay here long.
No, I promise Mr. Safian.

597
00:58:59,193 --> 00:59:02,113
No, you stay here as long as you want.

598
00:59:02,283 --> 00:59:04,689
I'll just take this and I'll go back up.

599
00:59:05,107 --> 00:59:08,655
Good night, Mr. Safian.
- Good night, Earl.

600
01:00:29,893 --> 01:00:32,516
Don't worry, it doesn't look as
bad as the other guy.

601
01:00:32,689 --> 01:00:35,313
I could have killed him.

602
01:00:37,282 --> 01:00:41,947
Junior, have you met the professor?
A very tough guy.

603
01:00:42,122 --> 01:00:46,040
If you want something done, alright
goddamn it, you call a teacher.

604
01:00:47,299 --> 01:00:49,507
Let me buy you a drink.

605
01:01:00,530 --> 01:01:04,198
You know, there is one thing I
realized during all this.

606
01:01:04,370 --> 01:01:08,585
Jed had just come out of the OR to
talk to me. He was covered in blood and

607
01:01:08,753 --> 01:01:13,964
he was telling me what he was about to
do and then he needed my permission to do it.

608
01:01:14,137 --> 01:01:18,387
And...there was a second, maybe a
second and a half....

609
01:01:18,562 --> 01:01:21,518
...between him telling me that Tracy
was pregnant and...

610
01:01:21,692 --> 01:01:25,479
... then telling me that the foetus was
aborted during surgery.

611
01:01:27,160 --> 01:01:31,825
That second,
that second and a half...

612
01:01:33,254 --> 01:01:36,707
... that was the happiest time in my life.

613
01:01:41,351 --> 01:01:46,100
That is a horrible story.
It's the worst story I've ever heard.

614
01:01:47,237 --> 01:01:52,235
And I aprreciate your words of comfort.
- I mean it, Andy.

615
01:01:52,412 --> 01:01:56,163
Like a fucking job,
shit just happens to you.

616
01:01:58,422 --> 01:02:02,637
Have you had a lot of success talking
jumpers in from window ledges?

617
01:02:07,563 --> 01:02:10,010
May I ask you something?
- Sure.

618
01:02:11,154 --> 01:02:16,863
How well do you know Tracy ?
-  She's my wife. What do you mean ?

619
01:02:24,426 --> 01:02:28,641
My brothers, my friends and my ex-husband...

620
01:02:28,809 --> 01:02:34,187
... have all accused me of wielding my sense
of honesty like a blunt instrument.

621
01:02:34,360 --> 01:02:38,549
I don't want to hurt you anymore
than you've been but...

622
01:02:39,995 --> 01:02:43,367
... I'm very sure I'm doing the right thing.

623
01:02:43,543 --> 01:02:45,833
What are you talking about ?

624
01:02:48,844 --> 01:02:54,269
I want you to come back to the station with me.
I must show you something.

625
01:03:18,563 --> 01:03:22,729
Sir, sir can I help you?
- I'm here to see Jed Hill.

626
01:03:38,681 --> 01:03:42,432
What the hell happened to you?
- It wasn't my baby.

627
01:03:42,451 --> 01:03:43,588
What?

628
01:03:43,648 --> 01:03:45,725
It wasn't my baby.

629
01:03:45,902 --> 01:03:48,988
Come inside.
What the hell happened to your face?

630
01:03:49,156 --> 01:03:51,614
Doesn't matter.
You know what this is?

631
01:03:51,787 --> 01:03:54,357
This is a police test.
A lab report.

632
01:03:54,931 --> 01:03:55,661
I don't understand.

633
01:03:55,818 --> 01:03:58,838
It's my sperm sample I left after
Paula Bell rape.

634
01:03:59,008 --> 01:04:00,722
I'm sterile.

635
01:04:01,870 --> 01:04:04,113
Can I have a look at that, please ?

636
01:04:05,018 --> 01:04:08,861
I can't have any children, so it
wasn't my baby.

637
01:04:10,276 --> 01:04:11,418
You got to call your lawyer Jed.

638
01:04:11,783 --> 01:04:15,414
You call your lawyer, you haven't tell the
insurance company to stop the presses because...

639
01:04:15,495 --> 01:04:17,157
... this thing. No, it's not over yet.

640
01:04:17,626 --> 01:04:21,579
Oh, Andy. This isn't about me.
It's about both of us, Jed.

641
01:04:21,755 --> 01:04:25,708
She ruined both of us. It's too late for me
but it's not too late for you.

642
01:04:25,888 --> 01:04:29,674
Andy, I don't mean to seem indelicate but
as far as my situation is concerned...

643
01:04:29,853 --> 01:04:33,474
... it doesn't matter if Tracy was sleeping
with the Boston Celtics.

644
01:04:33,651 --> 01:04:36,826
I took out her reproductive system.

645
01:04:38,243 --> 01:04:41,697
It was a wrong call and the bill was
20 million dollars.
- No.

646
01:04:41,874 --> 01:04:46,005
That's where you're wrong. See, the
20 million dollars is a big settlement, right?

647
01:04:46,173 --> 01:04:49,876
That wasn't for the fuck-up.
That...that was for the victim.

648
01:04:50,054 --> 01:04:54,803
The insurance company settled high and fast because
they thought they're up against Snow White.

649
01:04:54,980 --> 01:04:59,365
What happens if Snow White is shacking up
with her lawyer Jed, huh?

650
01:05:00,513 --> 01:05:01,296
You tell me.

651
01:05:01,452 --> 01:05:04,281
Andy, you're hurt & you
want revenge.

652
01:05:04,454 --> 01:05:07,956
& I can understand that, but I got
what I deserved.

653
01:05:08,128 --> 01:05:11,714
and you know something,
as much as this pains you...

654
01:05:11,885 --> 01:05:14,454
...no matter what Tracy was doing
behind your back...

655
01:05:14,704 --> 01:05:19,389
she got a hell of a
lot worse than she deserved.

656
01:05:20,316 --> 01:05:22,891
Did I?

657
01:05:23,070 --> 01:05:27,866
Did you what?
- Did I get what I deserved?

658
01:05:28,037 --> 01:05:32,536
Bad things happen to good people all the time,
Andy & for no reason.

659
01:05:32,713 --> 01:05:34,754
Take my word for it.

660
01:05:37,596 --> 01:05:39,637
I'll see you later.

661
01:05:42,145 --> 01:05:43,938
What're you gotta do Andy ?

662
01:05:45,066 --> 01:05:48,188
I'm gonna go out and
get to know my wife.

663
01:06:03,174 --> 01:06:03,601
Hi Dennis !

664
01:06:03,890 --> 01:06:05,767
He doesn't have an appointment, Mr. Riley.
He just walked right on.

665
01:06:06,043 --> 01:06:07,400
She tried to stop me, Dennis.

666
01:06:07,815 --> 01:06:12,147
See, I can call him Dennis coz we're old friends.
We both slept with my wife.

667
01:06:12,323 --> 01:06:15,860
Claudia, call security.
- Do that Claudia and then call the US Attorney's office...

668
01:06:16,037 --> 01:06:19,872
... and see if conspiracy to commit insurance fraud
comes under their jurisdiction.

669
01:06:20,044 --> 01:06:25,255
Forget security, Claudia. Just close the door
behind you. Thank you.

670
01:06:31,911 --> 01:06:38,199
This...This is a nice office.
- What the hell happened to your face?

671
01:06:38,368 --> 01:06:43,662
I beat the shit out of a deeply
disturbed serial rapist.

672
01:06:43,895 --> 01:06:49,002
Hey, I want an explanation.
- An explanation for what ?

673
01:06:49,179 --> 01:06:54,010
For how my wife could have been pregnant
when her husband's sterile?

674
01:06:55,230 --> 01:06:58,317
What was it - Immaculate Conception ?

675
01:06:58,486 --> 01:07:02,902
If that's the case, Dennis, I wouldn't have settled for
20 million if I were you.

676
01:07:03,078 --> 01:07:05,618
Andy, I had no knowledge of this.

677
01:07:05,791 --> 01:07:09,412
And I wasn't sleeping with your wife if
that's what you're suggesting.

678
01:07:09,589 --> 01:07:14,670
Bullshit.
- Then what can I do for you, Andy ?

679
01:07:14,849 --> 01:07:16,890
You can tell me where Tracy is.

680
01:07:17,061 --> 01:07:21,691
Telling you where Tracy is would break an Attorney-Client
privilege & I will not do that.

681
01:07:21,861 --> 01:07:25,992
Now there is nothing more I can do.
Claudia'ill be happy to call the US Attorney for you.

682
01:07:27,995 --> 01:07:29,279
Were you sleeping with her?

683
01:07:29,792 --> 01:07:30,773
No.

684
01:07:36,594 --> 01:07:41,841
Can you help me?
- Help you do what? What is it you want Andy?

685
01:07:47,697 --> 01:07:52,029
I want to talk to Tracy.
I know I'm asking you a favour...

686
01:07:52,205 --> 01:07:55,623
I've a professional obligation.
I've a legal obligation to my client.

687
01:07:55,794 --> 01:07:59,581
Your problems, your questions,
cold as this may seem are not my business.

688
01:07:59,760 --> 01:08:02,632
And I haven't got the answers you want.
Even if I did, I wouldn't be able to give them to you.

689
01:08:02,806 --> 01:08:06,973
Talk to her friends, talk to her
mother & talk to other people.

690
01:08:07,147 --> 01:08:10,067
What did you say?
- I'm saying this is a personal matter.

691
01:08:10,236 --> 01:08:13,904
Did you say 'talk to her mother'?
- She certainly knows Tracy better than I do.

692
01:08:14,076 --> 01:08:16,200
Her mother is dead.

693
01:08:16,373 --> 01:08:20,040
When did she die?
- Twelve years ago.

694
01:08:20,213 --> 01:08:23,299
You handled the estate.

695
01:08:23,467 --> 01:08:26,470
No, I didn't.
- What're you saying to me?

696
01:08:26,639 --> 01:08:29,416
I'm saying I didn't handle Mrs. Kennsinger's
estate and anything

697
01:08:29,424 --> 01:08:31,399
else rather than framework of your
wife's lawsuit is not my...

698
01:08:31,606 --> 01:08:35,358
I don't give a fuck about the lawsuit. I'm asking...
- Then we have nothing here to talk about.

699
01:08:35,531 --> 01:08:38,902
Is her mother alive?
Where does she live?

700
01:08:39,079 --> 01:08:42,782
Please understand...
- Fuck it. I'll find her myself.

701
01:08:43,271 --> 01:08:44,315
Andy...

702
01:08:46,090 --> 01:08:49,342
Scotch.
- What?

703
01:08:49,512 --> 01:08:52,088
Bring her a bottle of scotch.

704
01:09:15,308 --> 01:09:18,726
My name is Andy Safian.
- So what ?

705
01:09:19,899 --> 01:09:22,819
Did your daughter ever tell you
she had a husband?

706
01:09:22,988 --> 01:09:25,991
Did your wife ever tell you
she had a mother?
- Yeah.

707
01:09:26,160 --> 01:09:28,368
You're a liar.

708
01:09:28,539 --> 01:09:33,418
She said you were dead.
- What do you want from me ?

709
01:09:33,590 --> 01:09:36,795
I...it's nothing. I just want...
- Nobody wants nothing.

710
01:09:37,930 --> 01:09:41,717
I thought maybe we could
have a drink and talk.

711
01:09:57,214 --> 01:10:02,009
She sure loved her daddy.
Second on the place of the best swindlers in Boston.

712
01:10:02,182 --> 01:10:05,933
He taught her everything.
She was daddy's girl.

713
01:10:06,104 --> 01:10:08,513
I wanted to ask you some questions.

714
01:10:08,692 --> 01:10:11,363
She tried to do the smart thing,
I give you that.

715
01:10:11,624 --> 01:10:15,652
The smart thing. What was that?
- Marry a rich fellow. What do you think?

716
01:10:15,829 --> 01:10:20,495
Tracy was married before?
- I said she tried.

717
01:10:20,672 --> 01:10:22,880
You got to pay attention.

718
01:10:23,050 --> 01:10:28,475
One of Bill's old partners, a guy from Newport.
Millionaire with a heart problem.

719
01:10:28,644 --> 01:10:33,393
He wouldn't marry her though.
Not even after she got pregnant.

720
01:10:33,589 --> 01:10:34,998
Mrs. Kennsinger.

721
01:10:37,368 --> 01:10:43,077
This is single malt scotch.
That was so classy Mister.

722
01:10:43,253 --> 01:10:47,004
I haven't had single malt since '69.

723
01:10:47,176 --> 01:10:52,340
I drink crap. Blended whisky is crap,
I don't give what colour the label is.

724
01:10:52,519 --> 01:10:55,272
I need to find Tracy.

725
01:10:55,440 --> 01:10:58,313
Tell me the part again where she was
working with children's ward.

726
01:10:58,487 --> 01:11:02,868
I can tell you, she likes kids so she....

727
01:11:05,050 --> 01:11:05,937
What?

728
01:11:07,086 --> 01:11:08,024
What?

729
01:11:08,911 --> 01:11:10,424
Did I say something funny?

730
01:11:12,428 --> 01:11:17,771
She indeed found herself a dork (fool).
Like shooting tuna fish in a barrel.

731
01:11:21,152 --> 01:11:23,193
Big one too.

732
01:11:27,287 --> 01:11:30,540
You're drunk.
- And you're stupid.

733
01:11:32,213 --> 01:11:35,632
I can say that to you because
you're my son-in-law.

734
01:11:36,930 --> 01:11:41,642
Want to see something ?
- I want you to tell me where Tracy is.

735
01:11:41,812 --> 01:11:46,442
I'm older, I'm smarter.
You can learn something from me.

736
01:11:46,612 --> 01:11:49,568
I know she's been here.

737
01:11:49,743 --> 01:11:52,319
Andy... is it Andy?

738
01:11:52,997 --> 01:11:53,936
Yeah.

739
01:11:54,145 --> 01:11:54,980
Andy...

740
01:11:56,505 --> 01:11:59,780
It's a simple trick.
- The statue...

741
01:11:59,884 --> 01:12:00,354
What?

742
01:12:00,510 --> 01:12:05,135
This, the Degas.
- What about it ?

743
01:12:05,312 --> 01:12:10,523
It was in my house. It was Tracy's.
So I know she's been here.

744
01:12:11,258 --> 01:12:11,884
Andy...

745
01:12:12,575 --> 01:12:18,000
Believe me. You need to see this trick.
- Do you get that I'm serious?

746
01:12:18,168 --> 01:12:21,420
I got it. Pick a card.

747
01:12:32,025 --> 01:12:34,316
Look at it.

748
01:12:36,074 --> 01:12:38,198
Put it back in the deck.

749
01:12:45,590 --> 01:12:47,631
Shuffle the deck.

750
01:12:47,802 --> 01:12:50,889
Mrs. Kennsinger, I don't want...
- You can call me 'Mom'.

751
01:12:52,936 --> 01:12:55,061
I don't think so.

752
01:12:56,275 --> 01:13:00,027
Shuffle the cards. And shuffle them good.

753
01:13:02,119 --> 01:13:07,912
We used to give Tracy some money each week
so she could buy candy. Shuffle the cards!

754
01:13:10,176 --> 01:13:15,007
She won't spend it though, not a penny.
Each week she put it under the mattress.

755
01:13:16,102 --> 01:13:19,937
I swear I think there could
be $ 200 under the mattress.

756
01:13:21,027 --> 01:13:24,363
I'll tell you something else about Tracy...

757
01:13:24,533 --> 01:13:29,412
I don't think it bothered her a bit when her father
cleaned up the bank accounts and disappeared.

758
01:13:31,212 --> 01:13:36,506
I think it bothered her when he took
the 200 dollars from under the mattress.

759
01:13:36,679 --> 01:13:39,635
Jesus! what the hell kind of a family is this ?

760
01:13:40,769 --> 01:13:42,810
Want to bet?
- What?

761
01:13:42,981 --> 01:13:47,481
200 bucks. You will give me 200 bucks if I guess
where your card is else I give you 200 bucks.

762
01:13:48,196 --> 01:13:48,770
No.

763
01:13:49,452 --> 01:13:52,206
Because once money is involved,
you take me seriously, right?

764
01:13:52,374 --> 01:13:54,118
Look, you said there was a point here and I....

765
01:13:54,292 --> 01:13:57,130
Why do you give a Frenchman's fuck who
she was sleeping with?

766
01:13:57,299 --> 01:14:02,048
Get into the game.
Go for the 20 million yourself.

767
01:14:02,223 --> 01:14:04,716
Are you saying that Tracy set this up?

768
01:14:04,895 --> 01:14:09,062
What the hell have I been telling you?
Am I talking to my shadow?

769
01:14:10,238 --> 01:14:13,194
You think you're Sherlock Holmes with this statue?

770
01:14:13,368 --> 01:14:17,369
You can buy them in any departmental store...
89, 95. Looks just like the real thing.

771
01:14:17,542 --> 01:14:23,252
The whole thing was a setup?
You're crazy.

772
01:14:24,301 --> 01:14:25,240
Yeah ?

773
01:14:26,057 --> 01:14:29,927
Then how come I have the Jack of Clubs
in my fucking pocket?

774
01:14:40,207 --> 01:14:43,376
Look kid, I don't know what the game is.

775
01:14:43,545 --> 01:14:46,999
But you got stung,
so did your friend, the surgeon.

776
01:14:47,177 --> 01:14:51,676
Maybe, it's best to just take a medicine
like a good little boy and go home.

777
01:14:51,852 --> 01:14:55,984
But do me a favour.
Leave me this scotch.

778
01:15:01,702 --> 01:15:07,162
What happened to the baby?   - What baby?
- The Newport millionaire, their baby.

779
01:15:08,256 --> 01:15:11,294
She pocketed the money he
gave her for an abortion.

780
01:15:11,469 --> 01:15:15,303
Went downtown to a clinic.
She ended up working for the doctor.

781
01:15:15,477 --> 01:15:17,637
And there's a happy ending.

782
01:15:17,813 --> 01:15:21,101
She disappeared with 80,000 dollars of
the clinic's money.

783
01:15:21,277 --> 01:15:24,066
How much of that do you think I saw?
What was the name of the doctor?

784
01:15:24,242 --> 01:15:26,152
How much you think I'm going to see
from this 20 million?

785
01:15:26,328 --> 01:15:28,526
Was the name of the doctor David Lillianfield ?

786
01:15:28,683 --> 01:15:30,718
How much do you think she's gonna give her dead mother?

787
01:15:30,795 --> 01:15:32,207
Was it?
- Was what what?

788
01:15:32,381 --> 01:15:34,422
You think you can drink like this
and remember a name ?

789
01:15:34,593 --> 01:15:37,680
Was the name of the doctor David Lillianfield ?

790
01:15:40,520 --> 01:15:42,561
Welcome to the game.

791
01:16:13,702 --> 01:16:16,160
CODE BLUE
ANSWERING SERVICE

792
01:16:32,074 --> 01:16:33,169
Hello!

793
01:16:38,512 --> 01:16:39,430
Excuse me.

794
01:16:41,042 --> 01:16:43,083
Can I talk to your manager ?

795
01:16:48,388 --> 01:16:52,056
Mr. Hearn leaves at 5 o'clock.
You're gonna have to come back tomorrow.

796
01:16:52,227 --> 01:16:54,767
I'm Dr. Lillianfield.
Mr. Hearn wanted me to come by to fill...

797
01:16:54,941 --> 01:16:59,072
... out a change of address card for your billing.

798
01:17:09,967 --> 01:17:13,386
Is that Lillianfield ?
- Yeah. David.

799
01:17:16,854 --> 01:17:22,778
Why don't you just write it on the back of the old
card and we'll take care of the rest tomorrow.

800
01:17:22,839 --> 01:17:23,986
Thanks.

801
01:20:20,089 --> 01:20:22,130
Where is the key ?

802
01:20:27,936 --> 01:20:29,764
I'm soaked.

803
01:20:30,566 --> 01:20:32,525
God! I'm freezing.

804
01:20:33,613 --> 01:20:35,738
It's cold in here.

805
01:20:38,205 --> 01:20:42,537
We must do something about the latch.

806
01:20:44,799 --> 01:20:47,553
Oh, this damn door is driving me crazy.

807
01:20:51,937 --> 01:20:53,978
I am frozen through.

808
01:21:00,368 --> 01:21:02,409
Warm me up, I'm freezing.

809
01:21:08,757 --> 01:21:11,333
Take me upstairs and fuck me.

810
01:23:51,916 --> 01:23:55,583
I should be heading back to town.
- We just got here.

811
01:23:55,757 --> 01:23:58,843
I know, but it's broad daylight.

812
01:23:59,930 --> 01:24:04,560
Relax. It's a done deal.
I'm getting the cheque on Monday.

813
01:24:07,443 --> 01:24:09,485
What's wrong with you?

814
01:24:10,782 --> 01:24:13,820
I got a letter today.
- From who ?

815
01:24:13,996 --> 01:24:19,077
Whom, from whom. From Dr. Kessler.
- What did he say ?

816
01:24:19,256 --> 01:24:21,271
He didn't say, Tracy. It was a letter.
He wrote.

817
01:24:21,584 --> 01:24:26,070
Jed, take a drink, take a pill, do whatever it is
you have to, but lighten the fuck up.

818
01:24:26,175 --> 01:24:27,740
What did he write?

819
01:24:29,650 --> 01:24:33,068
That he was sorry.
That he was very sorry.

820
01:24:34,156 --> 01:24:35,782
That was thoughtful of him.

821
01:24:37,757 --> 01:24:38,592
What?

822
01:24:39,207 --> 01:24:44,003
That was. The man put himself at the top.
I was in the room. The bartender was just icing..

823
01:24:44,174 --> 01:24:46,963
... but Kessler's (testimony) was the one who closed it.

824
01:24:47,137 --> 01:24:53,940
Common, what more do you want from the man?
- I want him to know it.

825
01:24:54,108 --> 01:24:57,811
I want him to know that I was holding the strings.

826
01:24:57,990 --> 01:25:01,991
He's sorry? Let him say he was sorry
about Mass General.

827
01:25:02,163 --> 01:25:05,369
When he says he was wrong, when he
says that I should have gotten the job then...

828
01:25:05,545 --> 01:25:09,676
... you talk about bygones being bygones.

829
01:25:18,734 --> 01:25:23,281
In the meantime, I think I'll send him a postcard.
- There, that's the spirit.

830
01:25:23,451 --> 01:25:27,582
A picture of me sitting under a
palm tree with 10 million dollars in one hand...

831
01:25:27,750 --> 01:25:31,418
... and a copy of his 'God-complex'
memo in the other.

832
01:25:32,508 --> 01:25:35,215
With an inscription.
- What would it say?

833
01:25:35,388 --> 01:25:39,009
It wouldn't say anything. It would read.
- Good going, Trace.

834
01:25:39,187 --> 01:25:40,848
What would it read?

835
01:25:41,023 --> 01:25:45,356
Never under-estimate a genius with
a 'chip on your shoulder'.

836
01:27:09,469 --> 01:27:11,510
What the fuck was that ?

837
01:27:14,278 --> 01:27:15,530
Oh my God.

838
01:27:16,563 --> 01:27:18,604
Where did that come from?

839
01:27:19,808 --> 01:27:22,313
Andy.
- What?

840
01:27:23,869 --> 01:27:27,869
Andy's been here.
- What are you talking about ?

841
01:27:28,961 --> 01:27:32,795
He knows.
- Then why aren't the police knocking on the door ?

842
01:27:33,886 --> 01:27:36,640
Because he's playing with us.
- Andy?

843
01:27:36,808 --> 01:27:39,645
I don't believe it.
- Believe it.

844
01:27:39,813 --> 01:27:43,683
How could he possibly...
- Well, let's think about that for a moment, shall we?.

845
01:27:43,862 --> 01:27:47,363
What could we have done wrong ?
Let's retrace the plan...

846
01:27:47,535 --> 01:27:53,791
... and see if we can put our finger on a detail we
may have overlooked. One of us may have improvised.

847
01:27:53,963 --> 01:27:57,335
One of us may have decided that to get
pregnant would double the money.

848
01:27:57,510 --> 01:28:01,286
It did double the money. Now I don't want
to hear about it anymore. It is history.

849
01:28:01,339 --> 01:28:02,539
Oh, no..no. No kidding.

850
01:28:02,936 --> 01:28:07,815
It's the present. It's the here and the now
and the needle in the haystack.

851
01:28:07,987 --> 01:28:09,373
Let me ask you something.

852
01:28:09,582 --> 01:28:13,025
Once he found out he was sterile,
how long do you think it took him...

853
01:28:13,130 --> 01:28:15,826
... to figure out there was no Dr. Lillianfield ?

854
01:28:16,001 --> 01:28:20,714
Do you understand what I'm saying?
There wasn't supposed to be a baby.

855
01:28:24,933 --> 01:28:26,974
I'll take care of Andy.

856
01:28:52,231 --> 01:28:54,272
Don't get up.

857
01:28:55,862 --> 01:28:58,782
What happened to your face?

858
01:28:58,951 --> 01:29:00,363
I tripped.

859
01:29:01,455 --> 01:29:05,622
I heard they caught the guy, the rapist.
- Yeah.

860
01:29:05,795 --> 01:29:08,038
Well, that must be a load off your mind.

861
01:29:09,177 --> 01:29:12,465
Yeah, it's great to finally have
things back to normal.

862
01:29:14,173 --> 01:29:14,955
Andy...

863
01:29:15,980 --> 01:29:19,233
They can be back to normal.

864
01:29:19,403 --> 01:29:20,225
What's that?

865
01:29:21,947 --> 01:29:23,042
Things.

866
01:29:24,745 --> 01:29:26,786
Our life.

867
01:29:28,001 --> 01:29:30,042
Remember me?

868
01:29:35,222 --> 01:29:37,263
Tracy.
- What ?

869
01:29:39,688 --> 01:29:41,929
I think you dropped your shoe.

870
01:29:44,655 --> 01:29:48,869
What can I get you?
- We'll have two glasses of house wine.

871
01:29:49,037 --> 01:29:51,577
Is Chardonnay alright?
- It'll be fine.

872
01:29:51,750 --> 01:29:53,994
Anything else ?
- Some privacy.

873
01:29:57,720 --> 01:30:01,851
Now I'm going to talk for a minute,
So it would be better if you don't interrupt me, okay?

874
01:30:02,936 --> 01:30:06,474
I found a hypodermic needle in my bed.

875
01:30:06,651 --> 01:30:09,773
I don't know who put it there,
it doesn't matter.

876
01:30:09,950 --> 01:30:13,701
What matters, is that I didn't think it was funny.

877
01:30:13,872 --> 01:30:16,781
And as you well know,
I've a healthy sense of humour.

878
01:30:16,990 --> 01:30:19,666
So what I'm saying is this:

879
01:30:21,093 --> 01:30:26,138
Whoever played that joke is playing in a league
that's just not ready for it.

880
01:30:28,106 --> 01:30:31,976
Now I came here hoping we
could reach an understanding.

881
01:30:32,155 --> 01:30:37,829
I'm afraid I'm gonna have to hold grudge on this one, Trace.
- Oh, go to cops. They'll call you crazy.

882
01:30:37,998 --> 01:30:41,785
While still we have another school, why don't you
try getting a teaching job? 'Happy Hunting', Andy.

883
01:30:41,934 --> 01:30:44,171
Sit the fuck down.
- What?

884
01:30:44,341 --> 01:30:49,137
I said, sit the fuck down.
I'm running the show now.

885
01:30:52,189 --> 01:30:54,978
You're running it with an empty hypodermic needle?

886
01:30:55,153 --> 01:30:58,025
I'm running it with trace amounts of Pergonal.

887
01:31:05,921 --> 01:31:07,796
Here it is.

888
01:31:08,886 --> 01:31:13,442
Mam, would you happen to know anything
about a drug called Pergonal?

889
01:31:13,546 --> 01:31:14,589
I'm sorry.

890
01:31:15,104 --> 01:31:16,516
Never mind.
That's alright.

891
01:31:18,945 --> 01:31:22,032
It's a fertility drug, Andy.
I was trying to get pregnant.

892
01:31:22,200 --> 01:31:27,114
A fertility drug.
That's exactly what the lab guys told me.

893
01:31:27,292 --> 01:31:30,959
But it turns out that Pergonal,
when it's injected in like massive quantities....

894
01:31:31,132 --> 01:31:34,337
... can actually create ovarian cysts.

895
01:31:34,512 --> 01:31:39,094
They gathered brilliant young surgeon around
Trace, coz you gave us all quite a scare.

896
01:31:39,271 --> 01:31:42,476
It dissolved in the ovaries, so
you don't have clue how much I was taking.

897
01:31:42,652 --> 01:31:47,116
That's right.
It's not like I had a witness.

898
01:31:47,286 --> 01:31:50,491
I mean if I had a witness who saw
Jed giving you the injections...

899
01:31:50,666 --> 01:31:54,798
... you bought, both of you would be spending
the rest of your sexually active years ....

900
01:31:54,965 --> 01:31:59,713
... in a place where you'll work very good
such as prison laundry.

901
01:31:59,891 --> 01:32:01,470
You're bluffing.

902
01:32:01,598 --> 01:32:02,433
Tracy...

903
01:32:03,188 --> 01:32:05,229
Right now, other than anything else in the world...

904
01:32:05,400 --> 01:32:09,483
... don't you wish I had finally gotten
around putting up the curtains in the bedroom?

905
01:32:10,833 --> 01:32:12,189
Shit!

906
01:32:12,746 --> 01:32:14,158
Are you alright?

907
01:32:16,252 --> 01:32:18,579
You should rinse your hands with some water.
- No, I'm fine.

908
01:32:18,757 --> 01:32:22,128
Are you sure? Let me just...
- I said I'm fine.

909
01:32:23,891 --> 01:32:26,300
You spilled your wine, Trace.

910
01:32:29,525 --> 01:32:35,319
By the by, you should know in case some
bizarre active 'God' should happen to take my life...

911
01:32:35,494 --> 01:32:40,741
... my will's been amended to direct the police
to the 10-year old son of our next door neighbour.

912
01:32:40,920 --> 01:32:42,961
What do you want?

913
01:32:44,426 --> 01:32:47,299
What does anybody want?
I want the Red Sox to win the World Series.

914
01:32:47,473 --> 01:32:49,337
You haven't taken the kid to the police.
What do you want?

915
01:32:49,754 --> 01:32:51,632
I had a chat with your mom.

916
01:32:53,191 --> 01:32:57,655
Not bad looking for somebody who's
been dead for twelve years.

917
01:32:58,826 --> 01:33:03,538
What do you want, Andy ?
- I want to change my life, Tracy.

918
01:33:03,709 --> 01:33:07,544
I don't think I'm overstating when I say
that she knows some pretty cold card tricks.

919
01:33:07,716 --> 01:33:09,757
Cut the shit. What do you want?

920
01:33:11,097 --> 01:33:15,430
I want half.
What the fuck do you think I want?

921
01:33:30,465 --> 01:33:31,960
Give him the money.

922
01:33:32,380 --> 01:33:33,215
What?

923
01:33:33,803 --> 01:33:37,175
Give the man the money,
and let's get out of here.

924
01:33:37,352 --> 01:33:40,439
Oh Jesus, Jed.. I need you to focus on this thing.

925
01:33:40,608 --> 01:33:45,356
I'm telling you precisely what to do. Give the guy
the 10 bucks and we leave the country.

926
01:33:45,533 --> 01:33:50,079
I'm supposed to split the money three ways?
I'm supposed to just accept this?

927
01:33:50,249 --> 01:33:53,585
Welcome to the land where you
don't have a choice.

928
01:33:53,755 --> 01:33:57,008
Don't fucking turn on me.
I earned this money.

929
01:33:57,178 --> 01:34:01,510
This money is mine. He's not getting
a nickel. The cheque's in my name.

930
01:34:01,686 --> 01:34:03,727
Not in the prison, I doubt.

931
01:34:08,114 --> 01:34:12,031
Without the kid, he doesn't have anything.

932
01:34:12,204 --> 01:34:16,419
Without the kid, Andy is just a guy
who cracked under the strain.

933
01:34:16,780 --> 01:34:17,719
What?

934
01:34:19,466 --> 01:34:21,544
Absolutely.

935
01:34:23,724 --> 01:34:27,594
Do you know what you're saying?
- What's the big deal Jed?

936
01:34:27,773 --> 01:34:32,485
You cut me open, stuck your hands
and twisted my ovaries so that I look all that dead.

937
01:34:32,656 --> 01:34:36,110
Oh, excuse me, 'necrotic'. Now you develop
some enlightened sense of what's right and wrong?

938
01:34:36,287 --> 01:34:37,699
He's a child.

939
01:34:37,873 --> 01:34:40,746
No, he's a little fucking troll who deserves
to be put out of his misery...

940
01:34:40,920 --> 01:34:43,959
... for fucking up my life.
Now if you don't have the balls to...

941
01:34:50,437 --> 01:34:52,645
Don't talk about this again.

942
01:34:54,946 --> 01:34:59,278
Anything happens to the kid and I'm
the State's star witness.

943
01:35:00,412 --> 01:35:02,453
Give the man the money.

944
01:35:07,550 --> 01:35:09,591
I'm sorry I hit you.

945
01:35:20,573 --> 01:35:22,318
Put it down.

946
01:35:24,538 --> 01:35:28,159
Which blood did you let
me lose before you saved me?

947
01:35:28,336 --> 01:35:30,031
You waited an extra minute or two, didn't you?

948
01:35:30,136 --> 01:35:32,275
You thought about going the other
way after you saw I was pregnant.

949
01:35:32,327 --> 01:35:35,139
You thought for a second about
letting me die, didn't you?

950
01:35:35,306 --> 01:35:38,143
I'm a doctor.
- You were a doctor.

951
01:35:40,022 --> 01:35:42,064
Don't overestimate yourself, Tracy.

952
01:35:44,573 --> 01:35:46,651
Give me the gun.

953
01:35:49,022 --> 01:35:49,857
Come on.

954
01:37:02,041 --> 01:37:04,581
It's me. I have the money.

955
01:37:05,756 --> 01:37:08,047
Where are you?
- At Market Square.

956
01:37:09,428 --> 01:37:13,179
Meet me in the northwest corner
in fifteen minutes.

957
01:39:46,619 --> 01:39:48,779
Like shooting tuna in a barrel, huh?

958
01:40:15,670 --> 01:40:18,044
I won't mind shooting you.

959
01:40:21,263 --> 01:40:23,008
What took you so long?

960
01:40:23,183 --> 01:40:28,394
We were waiting for Jed.
- Somehow, I don't think he's going to show.

961
01:40:28,567 --> 01:40:30,608
Don't move. You need a doctor.

962
01:40:32,574 --> 01:40:37,240
You hear that Trace?
We need a doctor.

963
01:42:09,994 --> 01:42:13,615
You okay?
- I will be.

964
01:42:17,256 --> 01:42:21,387
You're supposed to put ice on that.
- I don't want any ice.

965
01:42:23,058 --> 01:42:24,969
You need ice.

966
01:42:25,145 --> 01:42:29,442
Fine.
I'll have mine in a glass of some scotch.

967
01:42:29,820 --> 01:42:30,446
Fine.

968
01:42:31,698 --> 01:42:35,829
Single malt. Nothing blended.
Blended whisky is crap.

969
01:42:36,999 --> 01:42:39,670
Somebody told me that once.

970
01:42:40,714 --> 01:42:51,148
