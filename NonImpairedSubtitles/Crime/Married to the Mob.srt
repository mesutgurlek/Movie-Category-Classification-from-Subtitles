00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:07,109
<i>A girl went back to Napoli</i>

2
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:11,275
<i>Because she missed the scenery</i>

3
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:16,914
<i>The native dances
and the charming songs</i>

4
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:19,630
<i>But wait a minute</i>

5
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:23,516

<i>Try an enchilada with the fishy bacalao</i>

<i>'How to mambo italiano!</i>

35
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:26,990
- He's gonna miss his train, Frank.
- Tommy, he'll be here.

36
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:29,918
I'm sorry you couldn't
come over for dinner.

37
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:31,996
- What dinner?
- Last night.

38
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:35,112
Rose talked to Angie about it.
She said you guys were busy.

39
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:37,595
She never mentioned that.
We were watching TV.

40
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:39,870
You missed a good dinner, Frank.

41
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:44,753
I don't know what's wrong
with Angela lately. I gotta talk to her.

42
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:54,871
Right on time.

43
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:02,798
<i>Passengers for the train arriving
on track four, please watch your step.</i>

44
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:05,716
I love you!

45
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:29,753
- How do these people do it every day?
- It's like fuckin' sardines.

46
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:33,234
<i>Every time I think of you</i>

47
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:37,399
<i>I feel shot right through
with a bolt of blue</i>

48
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:41,115
<i>It's no problem of mine,
but it's a problem I find</i>

49
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:44,519
<i>Living a life that I can't leave behind...</i>

50
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:47,029
I tell you what, Angela.

51
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:50,550
It all boils down to good follicles.

52
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:54,118
Youve been blessed.
One head in a million.

53
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:56,710
I ran into her at Foodtown.

54
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:59,035
- I invited her over for dinner.
- Yeah?

55
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:01,116
But Angela says they're busy.

56
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:04,232
Then, this morning,
Tommy is talking to Frankie.

57
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:06,749
- Turns out they were home last night.
- Stop!

58
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:11,237
Frankie didn't know anything about it.
She never even told her own husband.

59
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:13,794
Who the hell does she think she is?

60
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:29,875
Mrs D, you don't like it?

61
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,434
No, no. It's not the cut.

62
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:34,516
Thanks, Ray.

63
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:48,270
- Connie!
- Hey, doll! How are you?

64
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:51,030
Oh, look at you. A redhead!

65
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:53,755
- You look gorgeous.
- Oh, honey!

66
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:55,632
- Hey, Angela!
- Hi!

67
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:57,990
- How you doin', kiddo?
- OK. How you doin'?

68
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:00,509
You know me. Always lookin for action!

69
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:03,830
- You look terrific, kid.
- Thanks.

70
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:07,077
- That Frank better keep an eye on you.
- Yeah, right!

71
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:11,352
You comin' to the card game tonight?
Come on. We haven't seen you in an age.

72
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:14,790
No, I gotta help Joey.
He's having a lot of trouble in school.

73
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:17,753
Of course he is!
He hangs out with Tony Junior.

74
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:21,555
Face it, these boys will never be Einstein.
Come on over tonight.

75
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:25,434
No, I really can't.
Listen, I gota go. I'm real sorry.

76
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:28,313
Have a great time.
It was great to see you guys.

77
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:30,590
Bye. Take care.

78
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:35,710
That bitch! She thinks her shit don't stink.

79
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:04,870
I have three cards.
One red - you can take all my bread -

80
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,309
and two blacks - that'll set you back.

81
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:10,512
Watch it, chase it, see where I place it.

82
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:12,676
- It's right here.
- That's it.

83
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:15,155
Give me five and you win ten.

84
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:17,589
Aw...

85
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:21,633
- Gee, I coulda sworn, giris...
- Tough luck, giris. Try again.

86
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:24,674
Hey! What's goin' on here?

87
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:27,600
- Hi, Mrs de Marco.
- Hi, Tara.

88
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:30,429
- Hm?
- Nothing, Ma. Were just playing.

89
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:35,389
- You playing for money?
- No, we were just playing for fun.

90
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:38,193
Right, guys?

91
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:45,672
I want all of youse to go home.
Joseph Francis, I'll talk to you inside.

92
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:47,952
I'll be right in, Ma.

93
00:07:58,320 --> 00:08:00,072
- Hi, hon.
- Hi, babe.

94
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:03,431
- Goin out tonight?
- Yeah, Tony called a meeting.

95
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:07,235
- You playing cards at Connies tonight?
- No. What are you looking for?

96
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:09,794
No? Why not?

97
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:11,956
I don't feel like it.

98
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:16,070
Angela, when the bosss wife
asks you to play cards, you go.

99
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:20,239
I don't have to jump every time
Connie or Tony snaps their fingers.

100
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:25,070
I don't know what's wrong with you lately.
All the other guys, their wives get along.

101
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:28,397
Tommy and Rose invite us to dinner.
You lie to them.

102
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:31,592
They used to be your friends.
Now you can't stand them?

103
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:34,439
That makes me look bad.
How am I to get ahead in the family?

104
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:38,189
Same way you always have.
Lie, cheat, steal, kill.

105
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:41,110
Very funny. Youre a comedian now, huh?

106
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:44,073
<i>I should get you on fuckin Star Search.</i>

107
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:46,555
- Mom, I have to go to the bathroom.
- Hey, hey.

108
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:50,434
Come here. I do not want you takin
money from those kids any more.

109
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:54,473
- It was Tony Juniors idea!
- Oh! What, that makes it OK?

110
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:57,877
- You playing three-card monte again?
- Yeah.

111
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,753
- How much you take from them?
- 12 bucks.

112
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:03,512
- Not bad.
- Thanks, Dad.

113
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:06,871
Thanks, Frankie.
I'm trying to teach him something.

114
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,797
He's only a kid.

115
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:13,118
- What are you looking for?
- My revolver. Where is my revolver?

116
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,831
- Here, Dad.
- Joey, give me that!

117
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:24,514
- Go to your room, Joey.
- Come on, Lucky!

118
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:28,076
Thank you, Joey.

119
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,833
That's great, Frank. That's really great.

120
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,355
It's not loaded, Angela.

121
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:41,515
- I can't believe it.
- I'll keep it locked up from now on.

122
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:47,313
It's not just the gun, Frank. It's everything.

123
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:49,590
It's this whole life.

124
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:53,796
Your life is so bad?

125
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:57,830
You have a beautiful house,
plenty of money, a great kid,

126
00:09:57,960 --> 00:10:00,474
a husband who loves you.
What more do you want?

127
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:04,798
I want a normal life. I'm sick and tired
of the gambling, the guns,

128
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:09,198
<i>bailing you outa jail, never knowing
when or if you're gonna come home.</i>

129
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:14,235
Look at this place! Everything we wear,
everything we own, fell of a truck!

130
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:18,194
Sh! Take it easy, baby.
I don't think you're making much sense.

131
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:24,112
When I look at this house, I see
a swell house with beautiful furnishings.

132
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:27,472
When I go up in Joeys room,
I see all the things we give him.

133
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:30,672
Things you and I never had
when we was growin up.

134
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:32,791
Frankie, don't you get it?

135
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:35,195
Everything has blood on it.

136
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:39,076
I don't have to sit here
and listen to this garbage!

137
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:40,599
- Neither do I!
- No?

138
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:43,518
- No!
- No? What are you gonna do about it?

139
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:46,200
<i>- I want a divorce!
- </i>

140
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:54,715
Listen to Dr de Marco
for just a second, darling, all right?

141
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:56,990
You go upstairs, you take a Valium.

142
00:10:57,400 --> 00:11:00,995
You lie down, relax.
You'll feel a lot beter. All right, darling?

143
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:16,589
<i> Well, well, well.</i>

144
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:19,790
What have we here?

145
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:24,469
It's Nick The Snake and
his two nephews, Al The Worm and...

146
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:27,558
Dont tell me. Vinnie The Slug.

147
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:31,716
Your common, garden-variety hoodlums.

148
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:36,228
Ah! And speak of the devil,
Cucumber Frank de Marco.

149
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:38,759
Bang!

150
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:42,514
The gangs all here, Mike.

151
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:45,632

<i>Yeah, he's the paisan

161
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:44,472
He's Tony The Tiger

162
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:49,354
- Excuse me, Mr Russo.

163
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:51,548

165
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:57,436

Yeah.

171
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:26,274
- Hows Angela and the kid?
- They're both very good. Thank you.

172
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:33,118
- Ive got something for you here.
- Oh, thanks very much, Tony.

173
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:36,676
That was a great job
that you did on the train.

174
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:40,234
Well, it was a beautiful ride, Tony.

175
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:45,433
Go take care of the guys upstairs.
I'll be right up.

176
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:47,516
The same

177
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:51,674
The same melody

178
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:57,236
Somebody tell me
what's been happening to me lately

179
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:03,274
Tell me what the heck is goin wrong

180
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:06,193

- Yeah.

181
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:07,309
This way, please.

182
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:10,193
- My God, Tony! It's beautiful.
- Youre beautiful.

183
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:13,790
I am gonna have to do something
very special for you tonight.

184
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:16,115
You twisted my arm. The Fantasia.

185
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:18,390
- Our old room. 17.
- Room 17.

186
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:20,556
- Uh, duh... Twelve past ten.
- Ten past.

187
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:22,989
Yeah, ten past twelve.

188
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:46,233
- 2am. Quitin time.
- All right.

189
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:49,716
<i> But you did miss a good dinner,
to tell you the truth.</i>

190
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:54,868
<i>- You know Rosies chicken francese?
- With the ricota?</i>

191
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,274
Correct.

192
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:57,674
<i>Madonna.</i>

193
00:14:57,800 --> 00:15:01,270
Shells with sauce.
With cannoli afterwards.

194
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:13,432
- What, are you stayin?
- Yeah, I'm gonna take a bath before I go.

195
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:18,916
Is... somethin wrong, Tone?

196
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:22,353
Yeah.

197
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:29,630
You shouldnt smoke in bed.
Youre gonna start a fire.

198
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:35,119
<i>Tony, it's a water bed. </i>

199
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:38,108
OK, I gota go. Gimme a kiss.

200
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:48,394
Oh... Thanks.

201
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:51,035
Forget about it.

202
00:15:57,720 --> 00:16:01,190
You go straight home now, lollipop.

203
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:05,798
Hmm...

204
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:15,636
Frank?

205
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:19,636
Frank, you're early!

206
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:21,996
<i> My God!</i>

207
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:28,036
Put this over there.

208
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:41,796
Karen?

209
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:49,516
Karen?

210
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:58,316
<i> Karen!</i>

211
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:05,356
Save me some soap, Karen,

212
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:09,832
because I'm feeling extra dirty tonight.

213
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:15,235
<i> Rub-a-dub-dub!</i>

214
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:28,599
Tony, I had no idea
you was putin the stones to Karen.

215
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:31,516
It's checkout time, Frankie.

216
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:34,992
Oh, Tony, this blows my mind!

217
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:47,355
- I loved you like a father.
- You disappointed the shit out of me.

218
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:08,916
Go away.

219
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:14,718
Downey.

220
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:17,636
I'm there.

221
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:08,758
- Special Agent Downey, FBI.
- Let him by.

222
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:20,313
Yesterday The Fat Man buys a one-way
ticket on the Long Island railroad.

223
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:24,638
19 hours later,
Cucumber Frank de Marco takes a bath.

224
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:27,274
It looks like payback time.

225
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:30,631
Excuse me, gentlemen.
The place is clean.

226
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:33,513
I don't know, sir. Doesnt add up.

227
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:36,200
You got a beter make on it?

228
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:39,039
The late Karen Lutnick
was Tony Russos girlfriend.

229
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:40,878
No shit.

230
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:45,118
Maybe Frank was indiscreet. They don't
call him The Cucumber for nothing.

231
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:47,231
Karen was a real dish.

232
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:50,352
Tony finds out Franks eating of his plate.

233
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:53,711
Tonys got a temper.
A man gets angry, he gets sloppy.

234
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:56,115
Maybe The Tiger did it himself.

235
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:58,879
- That's murder one.
- Two counts. We could hang him.

236
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,230
Put me back on 24-hour surveillance.

237
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:04,636
I'll nail Tony for the murders
of Frank de Marco and Karen Lutnick.

238
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:08,639
Let us pray for our brother
to our Lord Jesus Christ, who said:

239
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:12,274
I am the resurrection and the life.

240
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:16,552
The man who believes in me
will live even if he dies.

241
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:19,559
Frank... My baby...

242
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:22,399
- We know that he will raise up...
- Such a good boy.

243
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:26,116
We commend our brother to the Lord.

244
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:29,360
May the Lord receive him into his peace

245
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:33,753
and raise up his body
on the last day. Amen.

246
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:42,594
- Frank! I'm coming with you!
- Mama!

247
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:45,989
Mama, no! Mama!

248
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:50,559
They found them in the tub... naked.

249
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:53,956
- What goes around comes around.
- Here she comes.

250
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:59,475
- Youse don't have to clean up.
- Angela, sh! Just be quiet, OK?

251
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:03,513
- Thanks, you guys. I appreciate this.
- What are friends for?

252
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:07,030
And we are your friends, Angela,
whether you like it or not.

253
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:11,590
I'm, um... I'm gonna go
check on my mother-in-law.

254
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:14,795
<i> Poor kid.
She's been through a lot.</i>

255
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:18,438
- You liar!
- No, it's true!

256
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:20,869
- Liar!
- No, it's true!

257
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,514
<i> Come on, Tony. Give him a shot!</i>

258
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:26,359
Hey! The two of youse knock it of!

259
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:29,520
All right, stop this fight! What is this?

260
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:32,359
Tony, get up. Get of. Get up!

261
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:35,831
Get in the house. Go on, hurry up!

262
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:40,436
- You all right, Joey?
- My nose is bleeding.

263
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:42,516
Let me see that.

264
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:45,756
That's nothing. That's nothing.

265
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:50,275
- Are you OK?
- Mm.

266
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:54,392
You two just stay away
from each other today, OK?

267
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:57,637
Go on.

268
00:21:57,760 --> 00:22:00,718
Thank you so much, Tony.
Thank you so much.

269
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:06,032
So, Angela... How are you?
How are you holdin up, huh?

270
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:07,513
I don't know... I'm...

271
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:09,870
Yeah, I'm OK. I'm OK. Yeah.

272
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:13,515
Now, look...
I wanna reassure you, Angela.

273
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:18,595
Youre not gonna be alone.
I'm gonna take care of you.

274
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:22,030
I really appreciate that, Tony.
I really do, but...

275
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:24,037
Angela...

276
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:27,754
I wanna help you.

277
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:30,030
Oh, you're so sweet.

278
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:32,114
Thanks.

279
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:33,673
Oh, Angela...

280
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:43,830
Holy shit! The grieving widow!

281
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:59,475
Keep your hands of me.

282
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:11,556
<i> Bingo!</i>

283
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:16,989
Ma, what are we gonna do now?

284
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:23,069
I don't know, hon.

285
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:26,397
<i>I just don't know. </i>

286
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:36,472
<i>Attention, shoppers! Sprint to
the deli counter, where pizza is on sale</i>

287
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:40,752
<i>for the next 30 minutes only.</i>

288
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:46,476
- Hi, Rose.
- Hi, Angela.

289
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:52,592
Angela!

290
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:54,358
Connie.

291
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:56,630
Weight Watchers, huh?

292
00:23:57,680 --> 00:24:00,069
You worried about your figure?

293
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:02,871
- Some of us are.
- Cute.

294
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,150
Joan Rivers Junior, huh?

295
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:10,955
You know, Angela,
sometimes when a girl gets single,

296
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:14,152
she starts thinking about
goin out with other giris guys.

297
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:16,840
Connie, I am not interested in Tony.

298
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:20,477
Everybody is interested in Tony.

299
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:25,671
You beter call it of, because
if I ever catch you two together...

300
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:29,396
I... I...

301
00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:41,952
Just forget about it!

302
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:45,516
Try keepin Tony on a leash!
I think you'll find one in aisle 5!

303
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:48,917
Oh, yeah? While I'm there,
I'll pick you up a flea collar!

304
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:50,996
Angela, watch your ass!

305
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:53,759
- Will that be spiced or regular?
- Spiced.

306
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:55,757
OK. Comin right up.

307
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:02,111
Die! Die, earthling!

308

Joey...

309
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:08,911
- Where did you get that?
- Uncle Tony gave it to me.

310
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:12,669
<i>- Uncle Tony?
- He gave me this, too. A $100 bill!</i>

311
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:18,437
- He bought some stuf for you, too!
- Oh, yeah?

312
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,070
Ta-da!

313
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:31,792
Die!

314
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:34,876
Joey, stop it!

315
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:38,790
What's the mater, Ma?

316
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,434
Joey...

317
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:48,314
Tony is not your uncle. He's not a relative.

318
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:52,069
And I don't want you
taking presents from him any more.

319
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:54,839
Can I keep the Lazer Tag stuf?

320
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:57,349
No. Sorry.

321
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:00,276
Run upstairs and do your homework.

322
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:02,436
OK.

323
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:34,915
Because I care.

324
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:46,713
- Your receipts, Mrs de Marco.
- Mm-hm, mm-hm.

325
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:48,796
Your generosity is overwhelming.

326
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:53,789
Here - the pink slip to the car, and
the address where to pick it up tonight.

327
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:56,070
God bless you, Mrs de Marco.

328
00:26:56,440 --> 00:26:58,954
Forget about it. Oh, after tonight...

329
00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:01,640
- Yes?
- Lose that address.

330
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:18,710
- Ready, big guy?
- Let's go, Mom.

331
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:21,877
OK. Here we go.

332
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:35,512
- Mm. Whos the bimbo?
- Angela de Marco.

333
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:39,191
<i> The former
Miss Angela Maria Gianelli.</i>

334
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:42,357
Daughter of Dominick and Catherine,
both deceased.

335
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:45,517
Mother of Joseph Francis, age seven.

336
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:49,474
Subject graduated
Bayside High School, Queens, 1978.

337
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:53,832
Atended one semester
Robert René Beauty Academy.

338
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:56,235
College education - none.

339
00:27:56,360 --> 00:27:58,999
- Favourite vegetable?
- Cucumber.

340
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:00,633
- Favourite animal?
- Tiger.

341
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:04,953
What? Cucumber Frank de Marcos
widow is screwing Tony Russo?

342
00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:09,358
- That's what Tonys wife thinks.
- I don't get it. How does Connie fit in?

343
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:14,873
From my observation, sir, Connie is
the one person who Tony actively fears.

344
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:18,754
Who knows why,
but it borders on the pathological.

345
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:24,234
Subject married
Francis Aloysius de Marco, May 15, 1979.

346
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:26,430
The key is Angela de Marco.

347
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:29,950
I say we tap her phone, her house,
her bedroom. Stake her out.

348
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:32,116
Scope her, tail her, coming and going,

349
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:35,835
and we catch Tony The Tiger
with his pants down.

350
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:38,520
<i> Not bad, Downey. Get the bitch.</i>

351
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:55,592
- Why is she stoppin here, Ed?
- I don't know.

352
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:05,351
<i> OK. Go on in.</i>

353
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:08,836
<i> Come on.</i>

354
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:21,230
Mom, we can't live here.

355
00:29:22,520 --> 00:29:25,671
I told you this is all
we can aford right now, Joey.

356
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:28,756
Things are gonna be tough for a while.

357
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:30,029
Whoo!

358
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:34,233
I'm gonna get a good job, we'll save
some money, and we'll find a nicer place.

359
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:38,273
Were gonna lead a good life that we can
be proud of. That's what maters now.

360
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:40,960
OK, but this place really sucks.

361
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:45,312
Yeah, I know. Let's go down
and unload the car, OK?

362
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:49,639
What's that thing
in the middle of that room?

363
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:52,398
A bathtub.

364
00:29:52,520 --> 00:29:55,512
- Why is it in the kitchen?
- I'll tell you later.

365
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:59,270
<i> Happy birthday</i>

- Blow em out now!
- Make a wish!

368
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:14,916
I got a wish.

Honey, cut the cake. I'll be right back.

373

Oh, thank you, sweetie.

374
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:40,959
Where did she go?

375
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:46,518
Tony, she moved into some shithole on
the Lower East Side. Heres the address.

376
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:49,234
- What the he'lls she doin' there?
- Beats me.

377
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:52,830
Tony, it's in a hell of a place.
I wouldnt have a dog live there.

378
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:55,599
- It's falling apart.
- It's that bad.

379
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:58,109
It's a dangerous neighbourhood.

380
00:30:58,800 --> 00:31:01,519
Did you remember
that orange notebook on the couch?

381
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:02,834
Mm-hm.

382
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:07,238
- Ma, I wanna go in that way!
- Joey, I don't... I don't think... OK, OK.

383
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:10,193
- Mom, don't worry about me.
- OK, OK.

384
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:14,438
All right, I'm gonna pick you up
right here at three oclock. OK?

385
00:31:14,560 --> 00:31:15,709
Good luck.

Hi! Can I help you with something?

393
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:27,754
I'm not sure you're the person
I should talk to.

394
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:32,078
I'm here about your advertisement in the
newspaper, about the cosmetics position.

395
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:37,558
I'm sorry. They already hired somebody.
Youve got to get here really early.

396

<i>I'm just a travelling stranger

Hello, sweetie. How are you today?

399
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:35,599
Oh... I can't find a job.

400
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:40,518
Go to Chicken Lickin right next door.
They got a sign in the window.

401
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:42,596
- Right here.
- Yeah?

402

Ive never worked in a restaurant before.

406

But I'm a hard worker and I learn real fast.

Good.

But, you know...

467
00:39:13,240 --> 00:39:15,754
You fix it up right, itll be great.

468
00:39:15,880 --> 00:39:17,757
Yeah, I think so.

469
00:39:17,880 --> 00:39:21,350
We got you some olive oil,
some beautiful tomatoes.

470
00:39:21,480 --> 00:39:24,358
That smoked mozzarella you like,
half a dozen bagels.

471
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:28,075
- We even got a few household items.
- You really shouldnt have.

472
00:39:28,520 --> 00:39:31,796
<i>You know, Angela,
we miss Frank a hell of a lot.</i>

473
00:39:32,840 --> 00:39:36,276
- And we miss you, too.
- That's right, Angela.

474
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:39,312
Were still your family. We always will be.

475
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:41,712
Oh!

OK. we'll walk you down.

478
00:39:47,080 --> 00:39:50,675
Rosie wants you to come to dinner
next week. Say, Thursday? Friday?

479
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:52,597
- Oh, I, uh...
- Any night.

480
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:58,158
Gee, Tommy, I'm so busy with the move
and getin set up and everything...

481
00:39:58,280 --> 00:40:03,195
And I don't even know if we'll stay here.
Why don't I call you when I'm setled?

482
00:40:03,320 --> 00:40:04,753
Sure, I understand.

483
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:07,269
- Say hi to Rose for me.
- Of course I will.

484
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:11,955
Everybody misses you so much.

485
00:40:13,640 --> 00:40:16,029
we'll see you real soon, OK?

486
00:40:17,080 --> 00:40:19,275
<i>Ci vediamo, cara.</i>

487
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:35,956
Excuse me.

488
00:41:36,080 --> 00:41:38,230
- Hello, gorgeous.
- Hi. I'm Angela.

489
00:41:38,360 --> 00:41:41,193
- I'm Rita. How you doin'?
- Hi, Rita. I'm fine.

490
00:41:41,840 --> 00:41:45,355
I'm looking for a job.
I saw your sign in the window.

491
00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:46,515
What can you do?

492
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:50,110
Well, I went to the, uh...
Robert René Beauty Academy.

493
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:52,390
Well, I didn't graduate.

494
00:41:52,520 --> 00:41:56,718
But I can clean,
I can answer phones, I do windows.

495
00:41:57,440 --> 00:42:00,238
And I live right across the street.
And, uh...

496
00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:03,349
I'm willing to try anything.

497
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:08,275
Please give me a chance.

498
00:42:10,120 --> 00:42:12,076
Almost there.

499
00:42:20,760 --> 00:42:24,469
- You like it?
- Yeah, I think so. It's...

500
00:42:25,640 --> 00:42:27,596
Boy, it's short, huh?

501
00:42:27,720 --> 00:42:30,518
- Well, it's a haircut.
- No, I like it. It's...

502
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:33,954
- I think it's short.
- It looks great on you.

503
00:42:34,080 --> 00:42:36,719
- Thank you.
- Youre welcome. See you tomorrow.

504
00:42:36,840 --> 00:42:39,354
Thank you so much
for the haircut, the job...

505
00:42:39,480 --> 00:42:41,869
- You won't be disappointed.
- I hope not.

506
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,719
- Bye-bye. See you tomorrow.
- Thanks, Rita.

507
00:42:46,360 --> 00:42:47,679
Next victim.

508
00:42:49,480 --> 00:42:53,109
Um... Note to myself.

509
00:42:54,920 --> 00:42:57,912
Run a make on the black chick.

510
00:43:06,760 --> 00:43:08,478
Oh, God!

511
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:11,955
Jeez, you scared me.

512
00:43:14,360 --> 00:43:17,796
- Hey, I thought you lived upstairs.
- I do. I'm a plumber.

513
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:20,992
I got of on the wrong floor.
They all look the same.

514
00:43:21,640 --> 00:43:23,710
Are you OK?

515
00:43:23,840 --> 00:43:26,308
No. I, uh... Not really. Uh...

516
00:43:26,440 --> 00:43:28,590
Ive got this, uh... flu.

517
00:43:29,720 --> 00:43:31,392
I oughta get to bed.

518
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:34,910
Listen. Ive got some great
12-hour cold tablets.

519
00:43:36,600 --> 00:43:40,593
- Why don't I get them for you?
- Uh... No! Um...

520
00:43:46,360 --> 00:43:52,196
This is like... a 24-hour bug.
It's very kind of you.

521
00:43:54,120 --> 00:43:55,997
OK.

522
00:43:58,840 --> 00:44:01,308
- You didn't notice my hair.
- Um...

523
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:03,590
No, I did.

524
00:44:03,720 --> 00:44:05,676
What do you think?

525
00:44:06,640 --> 00:44:08,631
It's a brand-new you.

526
00:44:08,760 --> 00:44:10,910
Thanks... I think.

527
00:44:14,040 --> 00:44:17,032
Take care of yourself.
Drink plenty of fluids.

528
00:44:17,160 --> 00:44:19,720
<i> Thanks for the advice!</i>

529
00:44:25,320 --> 00:44:28,835
<i> Ma, can I stay over
at David's house Friday night?</i>

530
00:44:28,960 --> 00:44:32,350
<i>- I don't know, hon.
- Please. Davids mother will be there.</i>

531
00:44:32,480 --> 00:44:34,471
<i>OK. Friday night will be OK.</i>

532
00:44:34,600 --> 00:44:38,070
Woof, woof, woof.
Promotion in this for the both of us.

533
00:44:38,640 --> 00:44:40,790
I ran into her twice today.

534
00:44:41,720 --> 00:44:44,837
She seems so... nice, Ed.

535
00:44:46,320 --> 00:44:50,359
I just can't figure it out, you know.
The move, this place...

536
00:44:51,120 --> 00:44:53,873
<i>- The job hunt.
- </i>

537
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:09,191
Hi, Mike.

538
00:45:09,320 --> 00:45:13,996
Here are those... 12-hour cold tablets
I was... You know, just in case.

539
00:45:14,120 --> 00:45:16,315
Jeez, um...

540
00:45:16,440 --> 00:45:20,274
I feel beter already. Must have
just been a six-hour bug. But thanks.

541
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:23,798
Mike, would you like
to go out on a date with me?

542
00:45:25,040 --> 00:45:27,110
You know, if you want to.

543
00:45:27,800 --> 00:45:29,791
You know, just dinner or, uh...

544
00:45:32,080 --> 00:45:34,036
Uh, yeah. Sure.

545
00:45:36,040 --> 00:45:38,156
Great!

546
00:45:38,280 --> 00:45:39,838
Um...

547
00:45:39,960 --> 00:45:42,315
How about Friday night?

548
00:45:44,160 --> 00:45:46,515
Friday night sounds great.

549
00:45:46,640 --> 00:45:48,073
- Great!
- Hey, Ma!

550
00:45:48,200 --> 00:45:51,158
- Hey! Howd you know where I was?
- I followed your voice.

551
00:45:51,600 --> 00:45:53,750
Some detective!

552
00:45:53,880 --> 00:45:55,996
Mike, this is my son Joey.

553
00:45:56,120 --> 00:45:57,553
- Hiya, Joey.
- Hi.

554
00:45:57,680 --> 00:46:00,035
Mom, did the cavemen
kill all the dinosaurs?

555
00:46:00,160 --> 00:46:04,676
Gee, hon... I don't know.
It's... a litle before my time.

556
00:46:05,240 --> 00:46:08,073
Actually, Joey,

557
00:46:08,200 --> 00:46:11,909
the dinosaurs were dead millions
of years before humans showed up.

558
00:46:12,040 --> 00:46:16,431
In fact, if the worid were 24 hours old,

559
00:46:16,560 --> 00:46:19,358
the dinosaurs would
have lived in the last hour,

560
00:46:19,480 --> 00:46:24,952
and the humans would have lived
less than two seconds of that 24th hour.

561
00:46:25,080 --> 00:46:27,230
Mike, you blow my mind.

562
00:46:28,120 --> 00:46:30,918
Hey, big guy,
have you started your homework?

563
00:46:31,040 --> 00:46:32,951
- No.
- I didn't think so.

564
00:46:33,080 --> 00:46:37,756
Why don't you run down and start your
homework? I'll be down in a few minutes.

565
00:46:39,920 --> 00:46:44,038
Youre really good with kids. Do you
have any? Youre not married, are you?

566
00:46:44,160 --> 00:46:48,870
Angela, if I were married,
would I accept a date with you?

567
00:46:49,360 --> 00:46:53,876
No, I guess not. Neither am I.
Well, I was, but he's dead.

568
00:46:55,840 --> 00:46:58,115
- I'm sorry.
- Oh, no. Dont be.

569
00:46:58,520 --> 00:47:01,398
Well, I'll get outa your hair.

570
00:47:03,360 --> 00:47:07,399
- So, uh, I'll see you Friday night.
- See you there.

571
00:47:08,480 --> 00:47:10,914
- OK. About eight?
- Eight o'clock.

572
00:47:13,440 --> 00:47:15,396
OK.

573
00:47:15,520 --> 00:47:17,476
- Bye.
- Bye.

574
00:47:21,360 --> 00:47:23,316
<i> Bingo!</i>

575
00:47:56,040 --> 00:47:59,350
- Prety wild, huh?
- It's very nice.

576
00:47:59,480 --> 00:48:02,677
This is some kind of punch.
I can't pronounce the name.

577
00:48:02,800 --> 00:48:04,631
What shall we toast?

578
00:48:04,760 --> 00:48:08,389
Oh, I know. Here's to elevators.

579
00:48:08,520 --> 00:48:10,636
You meet the nicest people in them.

580
00:48:40,560 --> 00:48:42,710
So where to?

581
00:48:42,840 --> 00:48:46,549
<i>- Well, I could use a little snack.
- The usual?</i>

582
00:48:46,680 --> 00:48:49,911
You read my mind.
Tell the boys behind us.

583
00:48:50,040 --> 00:48:51,996
All right.

584
00:48:54,760 --> 00:48:55,317
Hello.

585
00:48:55,440 --> 00:48:58,352
<i>- Are you hungry, boys?
- I thought you'd never ask.</i>

586
00:48:58,480 --> 00:49:00,596
Good. Were going to Burger Worid.

587
00:49:02,680 --> 00:49:05,592
- Alka-Seltzer Worid.
- You don't like Burger Worid?

588
00:49:06,040 --> 00:49:08,679
Drive up to the clown

589
00:49:09,160 --> 00:49:11,037
It's a Burger Worid town

590
00:49:11,160 --> 00:49:13,549
We-bee-de, we-dee-de-de-de

591
00:49:14,120 --> 00:49:17,396
The fries are crispy,
the shakes are creamy

592
00:49:17,520 --> 00:49:21,308
The Double Continental
with cheese is dreamy

593
00:49:21,760 --> 00:49:24,911
Charred, roting flesh
aint my idea of a good meal.

594
00:49:25,040 --> 00:49:26,439
Jeez, Vinnie...

595
00:49:39,880 --> 00:49:41,711
Oh, shit! Butch!

596
00:49:54,080 --> 00:49:56,992
<i>
It's a Burger Worid town</i>

597
00:50:19,560 --> 00:50:21,949
No! No! My feet!

598
00:50:38,200 --> 00:50:42,034
<i>Bonjour! 'Hola! Willkommen! 'Howdy!
May I take your order?</i>

599
00:50:42,160 --> 00:50:47,188
Yeah, I'd like two Double Continental
cheeseburgers and, uh... two fries.

600
00:50:47,680 --> 00:50:51,798
<i>- Two chocolate shakes.
- Merci! Gracias! Danke! Thanks!</i>

601
00:50:53,040 --> 00:50:55,315

- Oh, yeah. Rings.

602
00:50:59,920 --> 00:51:03,959
Could you add on, please,
two orders of onion rings?

603
00:51:04,080 --> 00:51:06,036
<i>You bet.</i>

604
00:51:21,040 --> 00:51:23,429
That'll be $8.20, gentlemen.

605
00:51:24,960 --> 00:51:27,997
Take out for the car in back of us.
Keep $5 for yourself.

606
00:51:28,120 --> 00:51:30,509
- Thanks very much.
- And extra ketchup!

607
00:51:30,640 --> 00:51:32,596
You got it.

608
00:51:34,200 --> 00:51:36,395
That's a new clown.

609
00:51:37,680 --> 00:51:40,148
- Tommy, let's get the fuck outa here!
- Dont.

610
00:52:01,200 --> 00:52:03,236
The clown.

611
00:52:52,480 --> 00:52:55,153
I don't care if you have to
send fuckin telegrams.

612
00:52:55,280 --> 00:52:57,794
Some clown just tried to kill me.

613
00:52:57,920 --> 00:53:01,151
<i>I want a sit-down in Miami in 36 hours.

once and for all.

615

Once you have found him,

<i>Once you have found him,

Oh!

619
00:53:37,960 --> 00:53:39,996
So, uh... what are you drinkin?

620
00:53:42,120 --> 00:53:45,157
- What've you got?
- Not a lot. Uh...

621
00:53:45,800 --> 00:53:50,874
Well, you have a choice of Café Lolita,
or tequila, or crème de menthe.

622
00:53:54,280 --> 00:53:56,191
You don't happen to have a club soda?

623
00:53:58,320 --> 00:54:02,359
Yeah. It's in the fridge.
Um... You wanna get it?

624
00:54:03,200 --> 00:54:05,475
I'll be right back.

625
00:54:07,560 --> 00:54:09,516
Night, Lucky.

626
00:54:31,800 --> 00:54:34,678
- I see you found everything.
- No problem.

627
00:54:34,800 --> 00:54:37,553
Why don't you take your coat of
and stay a while?

628
00:54:37,680 --> 00:54:40,035
Sounds like a fantastic idea.

629
00:54:43,520 --> 00:54:47,069
- Once you have found him
- Never let him go

630
00:54:51,920 --> 00:54:56,550
I really... I really liked that band.
Their music is kinda strange. I like it.

631
00:55:04,960 --> 00:55:07,110
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

632
00:55:20,720 --> 00:55:22,711
This is really good club soda.

633
00:55:27,280 --> 00:55:30,431
Would you rub my feet?
They're killing me.

634
00:55:30,560 --> 00:55:32,516
Um...

635
00:55:33,760 --> 00:55:36,991
I think I, uh...
I'm actually prety good at this.

636
00:55:37,600 --> 00:55:38,999
Yeah?

637
00:55:39,640 --> 00:55:42,712
I just gota get ahold of
one of these nerves in here...

638
00:55:44,800 --> 00:55:46,916
Ooh! Ow!

639
00:55:57,920 --> 00:55:59,876
Oh, God...

640
00:56:04,520 --> 00:56:05,714
Oh...

641
00:56:09,240 --> 00:56:11,879
Oh, God! Dont stop. That feels great.

642
00:56:12,800 --> 00:56:16,713
I can't remember the last time
a man touched me below the waist.

643
00:56:18,480 --> 00:56:20,835
<i>- I can't believe I said that.
- </i>

644
00:56:20,960 --> 00:56:22,359
Mike, I'm sorry...

645
00:56:22,480 --> 00:56:23,959
<i>- Whoa!
- </i>

646
00:56:24,080 --> 00:56:26,992
<i>- Hey!
- Oh, God!</i>

647
00:56:29,160 --> 00:56:32,391
- I'll just, uh... use the bathroom.
- It's right there.

648
00:56:32,520 --> 00:56:37,071
- You must think I'm so crude.
- Are you kidding? It's just club soda.

649
00:56:46,960 --> 00:56:48,916
Joey?

650
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:55,195
Guess whos here, Tone!

651
00:56:55,320 --> 00:56:58,118
- Connie...
- Guess whos here, babycakes! Come on!

652
00:56:58,240 --> 00:57:00,993
This is your life! Tony!

653
00:57:01,120 --> 00:57:03,190
- Tony!
- Connie, Tony is not here.

654
00:57:05,520 --> 00:57:06,475
Tone!

655
00:57:12,760 --> 00:57:14,716
What a fuckin dump.

656
00:57:14,840 --> 00:57:18,230
- What do you want, Connie?
- Where is he? I know he's here!

657
00:57:18,640 --> 00:57:20,870
- No ones here.
- Oh, yeah?

658
00:57:21,520 --> 00:57:23,476
What do you call these?

659
00:57:23,600 --> 00:57:26,672
- Glasses?
- I'll remember you said that!

660
00:57:26,800 --> 00:57:28,870
Your hair looks like shit!

661
00:57:31,440 --> 00:57:34,193
- Please...
- I'm here, Tony!

662
00:57:34,320 --> 00:57:36,390
Connie, you're making a big mistake.

663
00:57:36,520 --> 00:57:37,555
Tony!

664
00:57:42,480 --> 00:57:44,152
See?

665
00:57:45,440 --> 00:57:49,752
This is my neighbour Mike.
This is my friend... Connie.

666
00:57:50,320 --> 00:57:52,436
Whose husband are you, dorkface?

667
00:57:57,800 --> 00:58:00,997
Gee, I, uh, don't know.
Whose husband are you lookin for?

668
00:58:05,600 --> 00:58:07,556
- Mine.
- Oh.

669
00:58:08,480 --> 00:58:12,189
- I guess I got you on the wrong night.
- Get out! And stay out of my life!

670
00:58:12,320 --> 00:58:15,676
Look, I fight for what's mine.
I make no apologies.

671
00:58:15,800 --> 00:58:19,395
You can call me a ball-buster,
but it's just the way I am!

672
00:58:20,440 --> 00:58:22,590
Keep away from Tony!

673
00:58:46,360 --> 00:58:48,316
You all right?

674
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:52,956
It doesn't mater.

675
00:58:53,760 --> 00:58:56,593
What the hell was I thinkin?
I'm such a jerk.

676
00:58:59,760 --> 00:59:02,194
I thought I could start a new life.

677
00:59:02,320 --> 00:59:04,470
Gave away everything we had.

678
00:59:06,480 --> 00:59:10,359
Cut all our ties to the past.
Dragged Joey away from all his friends.

679
00:59:12,160 --> 00:59:15,152
Be good - look where it got us.
All for nothing.

680
00:59:15,280 --> 00:59:17,430
We'll never get away from them.

681
00:59:19,920 --> 00:59:22,434
And the funniest part of all...

682
00:59:22,560 --> 00:59:25,916
I wasn't even thinkin' of guys,
and then I meet you and...

683
00:59:31,800 --> 00:59:35,952
If you knew what I...
what I thought about us and...

684
00:59:38,760 --> 00:59:40,910
That's prety pathetic.

685
00:59:42,200 --> 00:59:45,749
I mean, let's face it.
They're never gonna leave me alone.

686
00:59:49,480 --> 00:59:51,436
The ball-buster...

687
00:59:52,800 --> 00:59:55,155
is Mrs Tony Russo.

688
00:59:57,040 --> 00:59:59,554
Recognise the name?
The Russo crime family?

689
00:59:59,680 --> 01:00:02,513
Well, my husband worked for Tony.

690
01:00:09,280 --> 01:00:11,748
And he was iced.

691
01:00:13,160 --> 01:00:16,152
And Tonys been trying
to screw me ever since.

692
01:00:17,600 --> 01:00:20,910
So... God, I hate them.

693
01:00:24,600 --> 01:00:26,431
Um...

694
01:00:27,560 --> 01:00:29,073
Jeez...

695
01:00:29,200 --> 01:00:31,714
I really, uh... misjudged you.

696
01:00:34,200 --> 01:00:36,156
I'm sorry.

697
01:00:37,800 --> 01:00:40,155
It was nice knowing you.

698
01:00:41,640 --> 01:00:42,914
Bye.

699
01:01:15,760 --> 01:01:17,796
Angela.

700
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:21,150
I, uh...

701
01:01:21,720 --> 01:01:22,709
Hey.

702
01:01:22,840 --> 01:01:26,150
- Ive got some things I have to say to you.
- You do, huh?

703
01:01:29,240 --> 01:01:31,196
Goddamn it!

704
01:01:32,080 --> 01:01:36,358
It's not easy to turn your life around.

705
01:01:36,480 --> 01:01:40,393
Especially when your past
keeps coming back to haunt you.

706
01:01:40,520 --> 01:01:43,080
What makes you so smart?

707
01:01:44,080 --> 01:01:49,473
Well, I, uh... guess I know you
beter than you think I do.

708
01:01:50,440 --> 01:01:52,396
Oh, yeah?

709
01:01:58,440 --> 01:01:59,998
Yeah.

710
01:02:00,920 --> 01:02:02,911
We all make mistakes.

711
01:02:05,040 --> 01:02:10,068
The important thing is to realise it
and to do something about it.

712
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:15,230
And to let yourself of the hook,

713
01:02:15,360 --> 01:02:18,511
because everybody
deserves a second chance.

714
01:02:19,280 --> 01:02:21,236
They do?

715
01:02:22,920 --> 01:02:25,275
Especially someone like you.

716
01:02:28,520 --> 01:02:31,717
That's the nicest thing
anyones ever said to me.

717
01:03:31,080 --> 01:03:33,878
<i>
- Let's go, Mike!</i>

718
01:03:35,600 --> 01:03:37,431
Open up, Romeo!

719
01:03:37,560 --> 01:03:40,358
- Whos that?
- That's my... friend. I gota get to work.

720
01:03:40,480 --> 01:03:42,436
- Your friend?
- I'll call you later!

721
01:03:42,560 --> 01:03:45,518
- Mike, is everything OK?
- Yeah, everythings fine.

722
01:03:45,640 --> 01:03:48,552
Wakey, wakey! Eggs and bacie!
Let's get goin'!

723
01:03:48,680 --> 01:03:49,635
- Ed!
- Ah!

724
01:03:50,680 --> 01:03:54,355
- How long we been on the Russo case?
- 14 months. Next question?

725
01:03:54,480 --> 01:03:57,756
- When did you last play hide the salami?
- Classified. Next?

726
01:03:57,880 --> 01:04:01,236
- Utilise a fun bag?
- Back of. Classified. Next question?

727
01:04:01,360 --> 01:04:04,397
14 months down the tubes
because your sausage gets lonely.

728
01:04:04,520 --> 01:04:08,069
Negative. We treed the wrong possum.
Angela's innocent.

729
01:04:10,400 --> 01:04:13,198
I don't know about you any more,
Downey. I just don't know.

730
01:04:13,320 --> 01:04:16,437
Your brains on hold.
Youre thinking with your dick.

731
01:04:16,560 --> 01:04:19,916
Maybe you're burned out. Fried.
In over your head.

732
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:23,150
Maybe you need a vacation.

733
01:04:24,240 --> 01:04:26,196
Maybe not.

734
01:04:26,760 --> 01:04:29,069
I don't know, Downey.

735
01:04:29,200 --> 01:04:31,760
I just don't... know.

736
01:04:34,360 --> 01:04:38,239
Three words, gentlemen: Get Tony Russo.

737
01:04:43,240 --> 01:04:46,073
<i>4.30... Tuesday. Rita.</i>

738
01:04:47,200 --> 01:04:49,316
You got it. OK, bye-bye.

739
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:53,514
<i>
- Hello, gorg...</i>

740
01:04:53,880 --> 01:04:56,394
- Angela de Marco?
- Yeah.

741
01:04:56,520 --> 01:04:59,114
FBI. You wanna come downtown with us?

742
01:04:59,240 --> 01:05:01,913
- What the hell is goin' on here?
- Rita Harcourt?

743
01:05:02,040 --> 01:05:06,830
Immigration and Naturalization.
You gota come downtown with me.

744
01:05:07,320 --> 01:05:10,392
Who the hell you think you is,
tellin us to come downtown?

745
01:05:22,600 --> 01:05:24,556
Mike, what are you doing here?

746
01:05:24,680 --> 01:05:27,274
Angela, you'd, uh... beter sit down.

747
01:05:38,920 --> 01:05:41,354
Mrs de Marco,
I'm Regional Director Franklin.

748
01:05:41,480 --> 01:05:46,508
This is Special Agent Benitez.
You already know Special Agent Downey.

749
01:05:47,320 --> 01:05:49,231
Downey?

750
01:05:49,360 --> 01:05:51,316
Youre FBI?

751
01:05:53,720 --> 01:05:56,439
Weve had you
under surveillance for some time.

752
01:05:56,560 --> 01:06:00,553
Surveillance? Is that what you call it?
Surveillance for what?

753
01:06:00,680 --> 01:06:05,196
- For starters, traficking in stolen goods.
- What are you talking about?

754
01:06:06,120 --> 01:06:09,908
You donated quite a bit of furniture
to charity. Very generous.

755
01:06:10,040 --> 01:06:14,636
- Unfortunately, most of it was hot.
- Oh... Gimme a break!

756
01:06:14,760 --> 01:06:16,830
That's three to five years, Angela.

757
01:06:16,960 --> 01:06:18,916
I also have a report from the IRS.

758
01:06:19,040 --> 01:06:22,669
Something about undeclared income
and defrauding the government.

759
01:06:22,800 --> 01:06:25,394
That's an additional 10 to 15
in a federal pen.

760
01:06:25,520 --> 01:06:29,798
- Frankie always took care of the taxes.
- You signed the returns.

761
01:06:31,120 --> 01:06:35,398
Then theres the mater of your husbands
death. We know who killed him.

762
01:06:35,520 --> 01:06:37,033
Tony?

763
01:06:37,440 --> 01:06:40,034
And we know who helped.

764
01:06:40,160 --> 01:06:42,310
What is this? Where did you get this?

765
01:06:42,440 --> 01:06:44,715
Youre in deep shit, Angela.

766
01:06:44,840 --> 01:06:48,276
And sos your friend.
She's being deported.

767
01:06:48,400 --> 01:06:51,949
She'll be under a palm tree
opening coconuts by the end of the week.

768
01:06:54,040 --> 01:06:56,270
You sleazy sons of bitches.

769
01:06:56,920 --> 01:07:00,071
- Unless you play ball.
- You people work just like the Mob!

770
01:07:00,200 --> 01:07:03,909
- Theres no diference!
- Theres a big diference, Mrs de Marco.

771
01:07:04,040 --> 01:07:07,476
The Mob is run by murdering,
lying, cheating psychopaths.

772
01:07:07,600 --> 01:07:11,036
We work for the President
of the United States of America.

773
01:07:11,160 --> 01:07:14,869
- Go to hell.
- Let's stop playing games, Angela.

774
01:07:16,200 --> 01:07:18,509
We can have you arrested and put in jail.

775
01:07:18,640 --> 01:07:22,519
You'll be declared an unfit mother,
and Joey will end up in a foster home.

776
01:07:22,640 --> 01:07:25,200
- Hold it, Franklin!
- Shut up, Downey!

777
01:07:27,320 --> 01:07:30,676
- You can't... you can't do that.
- Just you watch us.

778
01:07:31,840 --> 01:07:35,515
The meeting is all set.
Everyone is gonna be there.

779
01:07:35,640 --> 01:07:38,598
I'm havin' a travel agent
bring over the tickets.

780
01:07:38,720 --> 01:07:43,157
I'm handling the security myself.
I don't see any problems.

781
01:07:43,840 --> 01:07:46,149
That's real good, Uncle Joe.

782
01:07:46,280 --> 01:07:51,832
Oh, by the way, theres a, uh...

784
01:07:58,680 --> 01:08:01,592
- Well, have her come in, Uncle Joe.
- Right.

785
01:08:06,760 --> 01:08:09,832
Hey, fellas.
Evaporate for five minutes, will ya?

786
01:08:09,960 --> 01:08:11,916
You got it, boss.

787
01:08:19,280 --> 01:08:21,236
- Angela.
- Hi.

788
01:08:24,120 --> 01:08:26,634
Well, look what the cat dragged in.

789
01:08:29,280 --> 01:08:31,236
Come on, sit down.

790
01:08:39,040 --> 01:08:42,669
- It's terrible about Tommy.
- Yeah.

791
01:08:44,520 --> 01:08:47,830
Yeah, first it was Frankie,
and now Tommy.

792
01:08:49,720 --> 01:08:51,711
Hows Rosie taking it?

793
01:08:52,240 --> 01:08:57,553
Rosie took a months supply of Valium
this morning. She's at Mercy Hospital.

794
01:08:58,680 --> 01:09:00,636
Oh, God...

795
01:09:01,280 --> 01:09:03,794
<i>Frankly, I'm a litle surprised you're here.</i>

796
01:09:03,920 --> 01:09:06,070
Yeah. I know.

797
01:09:07,040 --> 01:09:08,996
Um...

798
01:09:09,720 --> 01:09:13,110
I don't know. When I saw
the newspaper this morning,

799
01:09:14,800 --> 01:09:17,758
all these feelings came over me and...

800
01:09:17,880 --> 01:09:21,270
You know, I just...
I just feel really lost and...

801
01:09:22,320 --> 01:09:25,357
well, you know, I just, uh...
I wanted to see you.

802
01:09:26,960 --> 01:09:28,359
Get outa here.

803
01:09:28,480 --> 01:09:30,994
You really scared me
the day of the funeral.

804
01:09:31,120 --> 01:09:34,078
You don't realise the efect
you have on a woman.

805
01:09:34,200 --> 01:09:36,555
Youre a very powerful guy, Tony.

806
01:09:38,040 --> 01:09:40,395
Dont bullshit me, Angela.

807
01:09:42,040 --> 01:09:45,271
You don't get it, do you?
Well, I didn't expect you to.

808
01:09:54,120 --> 01:09:57,430
- I'll see you around.
- Hold it right there.

809
01:09:57,560 --> 01:09:58,913
What?

810
01:10:04,640 --> 01:10:06,596
Are you bein straight with me?

811
01:10:07,840 --> 01:10:10,912
No, I came all the way out here
just to pull your chain.

812
01:10:11,040 --> 01:10:13,952
Well, you know something?
I almost believe you.

813
01:10:20,920 --> 01:10:23,639
Heres your itinerary, Anthony. Youre...

814
01:10:24,440 --> 01:10:27,557
Youre goin out on Eastern. 8am.

01:10:28,920 --> 01:10:31,070
Thank you, Uncle Joe.

816
01:10:35,520 --> 01:10:37,670
Where you goin?

817
01:10:40,080 --> 01:10:41,559
Miami.

818
01:10:43,080 --> 01:10:45,435
- Bye, Mom!
- Love you!

819
01:10:55,840 --> 01:10:58,593
Tony! Tony! Tone!

820

<i> Boarding flight 17,

821
01:11:07,400 --> 01:11:11,154
Yeah, that's it. All right,
we got a minute. Let's park it here.

822
01:11:11,880 --> 01:11:13,950
I'll double-check the tickets.

823
01:11:14,080 --> 01:11:17,709
- I'm gonna go freshen up.
- Oh, OK. Yeah, you got time.

824
01:11:29,240 --> 01:11:31,435
- Have a safe trip, miss!
- Thank you.

825
01:11:34,920 --> 01:11:37,388
Leave me alone!

826
01:11:58,920 --> 01:12:00,638
Holy shit! Nick!

827
01:12:00,760 --> 01:12:04,469
- I'm way ahead of you, boss.
- I don't believe this one!

828
01:12:04,600 --> 01:12:06,875
- Connie!
- Thank God I got here in time!

829
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:10,436
- What's wrong, huh?
- You forgot to say goodbye to me!

830
01:12:10,560 --> 01:12:14,599
- You forgot to say goodbye to me, baby!
- Oh! You were fast asleep.

831
01:12:14,720 --> 01:12:17,678
- I kissed you goodbye.
- You should have woken me up.

832
01:12:17,800 --> 01:12:21,793
Baby, I know Ive been hard on you lately,
but I had this awful dream,

833
01:12:21,920 --> 01:12:24,673
and I realised Ive been awfully selfish.

834
01:12:24,800 --> 01:12:26,392
Nah, come on...

835
01:12:26,520 --> 01:12:30,195

01:12:37,280 --> 01:12:40,192
- Please forgive me, baby!
- Dont be silly, Connie.

838
01:12:40,320 --> 01:12:42,595
No, no. Ive got a confessión to make.

839
01:12:42,720 --> 01:12:44,915
Angela! Come on.

840
01:12:45,040 --> 01:12:49,079
The other night when you didn't come
home on time, I got a litle suspicious.

841
01:12:49,200 --> 01:12:53,591
- I'm so ashamed. I went to Angela's.
- You went to Angela's?

842
01:12:53,720 --> 01:12:56,871
I couldn't help it, baby.
I had to see if you were with her.

843
01:12:57,000 --> 01:12:59,070
Just thinkin about you with that slut,

844
01:12:59,200 --> 01:13:03,352
I just... I got... I went crazy!
I couldn't stand it!

845
01:13:03,480 --> 01:13:06,199
Tony, if I had found you
banging that broad,

846
01:13:06,320 --> 01:13:09,153
I woulda hunted you down like an animal.

847
01:13:09,280 --> 01:13:12,716
It would have been slow and painful.

848
01:13:12,840 --> 01:13:15,229
You would have begged me
for mercy, baby.

849
01:13:15,360 --> 01:13:17,316
- I was so far gone...
- Connie...

850
01:13:17,440 --> 01:13:19,670
Youre talkin crazy.
I gota get on the plane.

851
01:13:19,800 --> 01:13:25,113
The point is, I'm so ashamed, baby, for
not trusting you, is what I'm trying to say.

852
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:28,992
Especially when I saw
the schmuck Angela was with!

853
01:13:29,120 --> 01:13:31,076
- What schmuck?
- Just some schmuck!

854
01:13:31,200 --> 01:13:33,350
Come on. Get on your plane.

855
01:13:34,200 --> 01:13:36,919
Boy, she didn't waste any time, did she?

856
01:13:37,040 --> 01:13:39,508
- Get on the plane, you maniac!
- Yeah, OK.

857
01:13:39,640 --> 01:13:42,393
Tone! I'm gonna be the best wife to you.

858
01:13:42,880 --> 01:13:45,474
OK, honey. See you.

859
01:13:45,600 --> 01:13:47,238
OK. Bye-bye.

- Hi.
- Oh, God!

861
01:14:04,480 --> 01:14:07,278
I hope that didn't shake you up
too much back there.

862
01:14:07,400 --> 01:14:09,755
- No. I'm OK.
- Good.

863
01:14:10,920 --> 01:14:13,480
- Champagne, sir?
- Thank you.

864
01:14:15,880 --> 01:14:17,836

865
01:14:19,800 --> 01:14:22,360
Heres to the mystery of life.

866
01:14:22,480 --> 01:14:25,358
We have a lot to learn
about each other, Angela.

867
01:14:37,680 --> 01:14:39,875
Hello, front desk. How are you, honey?

868
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:43,356
Beautiful. You have a reservation
for Mr Anthony Russo?

869
01:14:43,480 --> 01:14:46,916
Beautiful again. This is Mrs Russo.
I'm gonna join my husband.

870
01:14:47,040 --> 01:14:50,157
Listen. I want you to move us
into the honeymoon suite.

871
01:14:50,280 --> 01:14:52,999
Now, I want champagne. I want caviar.

872
01:14:53,120 --> 01:14:55,634
I want flowers.
I want the room to swim in flowers.

873
01:14:55,760 --> 01:14:58,558
And I wonder if you could...
Excuse me, honey?

874

I thought you deserved
something real special.

930
01:19:34,480 --> 01:19:36,436
So do you, Tone.

931
01:19:36,560 --> 01:19:38,357
- What's that? For me?
- Yeah.

932
01:19:38,480 --> 01:19:40,436
You litle devil!

933
01:19:41,440 --> 01:19:43,431
Your hands are trembling.

934
01:19:43,560 --> 01:19:45,915
I'm scared shitless, Tony.

935
01:19:49,640 --> 01:19:52,234
I didn't expect this of you, Angela.

936
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:57,638
It's magnificent.

937
01:19:57,760 --> 01:20:00,069
- You like it?
- Like it?

938
01:20:00,200 --> 01:20:02,668
Like it? Are you kiddin? Here, put it on.

939
01:20:04,240 --> 01:20:07,232
Look at that! Look!
Look how it picks up the light.

940
01:20:07,360 --> 01:20:08,839
Yeah.

941
01:20:09,840 --> 01:20:11,956
That's not all it picks up, Tony.

942
01:20:12,080 --> 01:20:14,435
Grand jury time, Tony.

943
01:20:20,200 --> 01:20:24,557
Director Franklin, Jimmy Fisheggs
just arrived. The gondola.

944
01:20:24,680 --> 01:20:26,671
Clear, Renée.

945
01:20:26,800 --> 01:20:29,678
Mr James Roe.
The partys shapin up nicely.

946
01:20:30,120 --> 01:20:32,998
Come on, Tony. Get your ass into gear
and get over here.

947
01:20:34,640 --> 01:20:37,029
- Stevarino, I'll get it.
- OK, boss.

948
01:20:40,520 --> 01:20:42,476
Come on in, fellas.

949
01:20:44,560 --> 01:20:47,472
- Whos your friend?
- Tony, meet Mike Smith.

950
01:20:47,600 --> 01:20:50,558
A lonely guy from Dubuque. A great guy.

951
01:20:50,680 --> 01:20:53,513
A one-man party
in search of the right crowd.

952
01:20:53,640 --> 01:20:57,315
- I knew you guys had to meet.
- You did the right thing, Nick.

953
01:20:57,440 --> 01:21:03,356
It's fabulous to meet you, Mr Smith. Great
to hook up with another party animal.

954
01:21:03,480 --> 01:21:07,234
I think it's Nick and Al here
who are the real animals!

955
01:21:07,840 --> 01:21:09,558
What the hell is he up to now?

956
01:21:09,840 --> 01:21:13,753
<i>- I admire your moustache.
- Well, thank you very much. </i>

957
01:21:14,720 --> 01:21:16,711
- Angela?
- Yeah?

958
01:21:17,360 --> 01:21:20,796
Come over here and meet
Mike Smith from Doobook.

959
01:21:23,640 --> 01:21:26,791
Hi. I'm Mike Smith from Dubuque.

960
01:21:30,080 --> 01:21:33,675
- Hello, Mr Smith.
- It's fabulous to meet you, Angela.

961
01:21:33,800 --> 01:21:37,588
<i>- Thank you.
- It's fabulous to meet all of you! </i>

962
01:21:37,720 --> 01:21:39,631
Let's take a seat, Mike.

963
01:21:39,760 --> 01:21:41,876
- Come on!
- Thanks.

964
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:45,390
- Sit down, Mr Smith.
- OK.

965
01:21:45,960 --> 01:21:47,916
Jeez, uh...

966
01:21:48,560 --> 01:21:52,678
It's a wild spread you got here.
Hey, I realise you're busy. I'll, uh...

967
01:21:53,320 --> 01:21:54,514
Agh!

968
01:21:54,640 --> 01:21:56,596
Fellas.

969
01:21:58,920 --> 01:22:01,115
Frisk him, Stevarino.

970
01:22:01,240 --> 01:22:03,435
- Watch him, Nick.
- You got it, Steve.

971
01:22:04,400 --> 01:22:05,992
Hold it, hold it!

972
01:22:06,120 --> 01:22:09,271
Make another move
and I'll blow your brains out.

973
01:22:13,800 --> 01:22:17,270
Well, looky here, boss. Only a lighter.

974
01:22:22,520 --> 01:22:24,590
<i> How very interesting.</i>

975
01:22:24,720 --> 01:22:26,870
Tony?

976
01:22:27,000 --> 01:22:28,115
Um...

977
01:22:28,240 --> 01:22:29,639
You know, hon...

978
01:22:29,760 --> 01:22:34,834
This is none of my business. I totally
don't even know what's going on here.

979
01:22:34,960 --> 01:22:37,315
But I think it's geting a litle out of hand.

980
01:22:37,440 --> 01:22:40,034
You beter stay out of this, miss.

981
01:22:40,160 --> 01:22:42,515
Check out this here.

982
01:22:53,680 --> 01:22:57,798
- Who the fuck are you?
- Federal Bureau of Investigation, Tony.

983
01:22:57,920 --> 01:23:02,596
Youre all under arrest. If you got
about 14 hours, I'll read you the charges.

984
01:23:03,000 --> 01:23:05,070
I can see the headlines in the morning.

985
01:23:05,200 --> 01:23:08,397
FBI hothead shoots love-nest girlfriend.

986
01:23:08,520 --> 01:23:10,829
- What the...?
- Freeze!

987
01:23:10,960 --> 01:23:14,839
Freeze. Any of youse move
and I'll blow his fucking head of!

988
01:23:18,120 --> 01:23:19,872
Go ahead.

989
01:23:22,160 --> 01:23:24,879
- I'm not kidding, Tony!
- It's all over, Tony!

990
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:28,834
The place is crawling with cops!
FBI, DEA, Treasury!

991
01:23:30,440 --> 01:23:32,271
- Angela.
- What?

992
01:23:32,880 --> 01:23:36,190
Be careful. Very, very careful.

993
01:23:36,560 --> 01:23:38,994
<i>- Dont!
- OK. OK. OK.</i>

994
01:23:44,920 --> 01:23:48,515
Angela, you're a very excitin woman.

995
01:23:50,160 --> 01:23:54,119
For some crazy reason, I think
I'd rather kill myself than hurt you.

996
01:23:54,240 --> 01:23:57,038
- But suicides out of the question.
- Oh, yeah?

997
01:23:57,160 --> 01:24:02,109
Just like you hurt my husband? Just like
you killed Frankie, you lying bastard?

998
01:24:02,920 --> 01:24:05,480
Boss, is that bitch tellin the truth?

999
01:24:05,600 --> 01:24:08,512
- Chill out. Chill out!
- That's right, buddies.

1000
01:24:08,640 --> 01:24:12,189
Tell em, Tony! Say it loud and clear
so we can get it on tape!

1001
01:24:12,320 --> 01:24:15,756
The whole place is bugged.
The chairs, the lamps, the paintings!

1002
01:24:15,880 --> 01:24:18,792
Any second now, 50 agents
are gonna pound at that door!

1003
01:24:18,920 --> 01:24:20,956
<i>- Ah, bullshit.
- </i>

1004
01:24:23,600 --> 01:24:26,512
That's it, Tony.
You have the right to remain silent.

1005
01:24:26,640 --> 01:24:29,598
Anything you say
can and will be used against you.

1006
01:24:29,720 --> 01:24:32,109
<i>- Shut the fuck up, fuzzball!
- </i>

1007
01:24:33,480 --> 01:24:36,278
- I'll get it.
- You have the right to an atorney.

1008
01:24:36,400 --> 01:24:39,278
Angela, stay...!
Get your dicks out of your hands, guys!

1009
01:24:39,400 --> 01:24:41,356
If you cannot aford an atorney...

1010
01:24:41,480 --> 01:24:44,438
- Mike, it's your old buddy Al...
- Shut up!

1011
01:24:45,200 --> 01:24:47,077
Agh! Connie!

1012
01:24:47,480 --> 01:24:48,959
Con?

1013
01:24:50,040 --> 01:24:51,837
Oh, my God! Tony, it's Connie!

1014
01:24:57,840 --> 01:24:59,478
Why are you here, dorkface?

1015
01:24:59,600 --> 01:25:03,275
I came to tell your husband
to keep his hands of of my woman!

1016
01:25:03,400 --> 01:25:07,837
Connie, don't listen to him. He's a cop.
And Angela is workin with him.

1017
01:25:12,040 --> 01:25:14,508
Honeymoon suite...

1018
01:25:15,680 --> 01:25:18,592
Connie, look. She gave me a ring, see?

1019
01:25:18,720 --> 01:25:24,078
But it's got a bug in it, Connie. A bug! Can
you believe that? How about that shit?

1020
01:25:24,560 --> 01:25:26,915
I got nothin to live for any more, Tone.

1021
01:25:28,600 --> 01:25:32,559
Of course you do. That's ridiculous.
Think of Tony Junior!

1022
01:25:34,840 --> 01:25:36,796
All your credit cards, honey...

1023
01:25:38,240 --> 01:25:42,358
All right, Connie. Let's think.
You got your game shows, honey!

1024
01:25:42,480 --> 01:25:44,436
<i>You got, uh... Wheel of Fame!</i>

1025
01:25:44,760 --> 01:25:45,670
Agh!

1026
01:25:47,080 --> 01:25:49,548
Connie, that was... that was close.

1027
01:25:52,240 --> 01:25:54,196
Watch your back, Uncle Nick!

1028
01:25:55,200 --> 01:25:56,679
Take him out!

1029
01:26:14,440 --> 01:26:15,509
You...

1030
01:26:29,600 --> 01:26:32,319
Gee, Mike. You didn't have to do that.

1031
01:26:33,680 --> 01:26:35,636
Now, Connie...

1032
01:26:36,280 --> 01:26:38,589
Connie, honey, I'm gonna change.

1033
01:26:38,720 --> 01:26:41,075
You certainly will.

1034
01:26:43,720 --> 01:26:45,995
FBI! Drop it, Connie!

1035
01:27:11,760 --> 01:27:13,716
- Hold it, Tony!
- Screw you!

1036
01:27:14,920 --> 01:27:16,876
- Fuck!
- Tony Russo,

1037
01:27:17,400 --> 01:27:21,951
you're under arrest for the murders
of Frank de Marco and Karen Lutnick.

1038
01:27:22,080 --> 01:27:24,389
You'll never make it stick.

1039
01:27:24,520 --> 01:27:26,670
- Sure, Tony.
- Come on, boys.

1040
01:27:32,080 --> 01:27:36,039
- Tony, what did you tell them?
- I'm sorry. I can't talk about it.

1041
01:27:36,160 --> 01:27:40,312
- How are the Feds treatin you?
- Not bad. I get to watch all my soaps.

1042
01:27:42,080 --> 01:27:45,072
The food must be good.
You put on some weight.

1043
01:27:45,200 --> 01:27:48,158
<i>- It's probably the bulletproof vest.
- </i>

1044
01:27:48,280 --> 01:27:50,794
Are you afraid someone
will knock you of?

1045
01:27:50,920 --> 01:27:54,037
Afraid? With these gorillas around me,

1046
01:27:54,160 --> 01:27:57,869
I feel safer than a virgin
at a eunuch convention.

1047
01:27:58,000 --> 01:28:03,028
Say, Robert. Excuse me. Would you mind
if I stepped in and took a leak?

1048
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:06,355
- Go ahead.
- Youre a gentleman.

1049
01:28:12,880 --> 01:28:16,236
Oh, the fries are crispy,
the shakes are creamy

1050
01:28:17,720 --> 01:28:21,190
The Double Continental
with cheese is dreamy

1051
01:28:21,320 --> 01:28:23,550
It's a Burger Worid town

1052
01:28:46,680 --> 01:28:48,557
Hiya, Tone.

1053
01:28:50,080 --> 01:28:51,399
Connie?

1054
01:28:58,120 --> 01:29:01,032
Kiss it goodbye!

1055
01:29:05,440 --> 01:29:07,237
No...

1056
01:29:12,440 --> 01:29:14,715
Holy Mary, mother of God!

1057
01:29:15,680 --> 01:29:17,432
Oh, shit!

1058
01:29:18,360 --> 01:29:23,070
- Another bad dream, huh?
- Uh, yeah. I guess you could say that.

1059
01:29:33,440 --> 01:29:35,795
Time to get up anyway.

1060
01:29:35,920 --> 01:29:39,595
Todays your big day.
Cant keep the grand jury waitin.

1061

Angela, you are an artist!

1062

- Youre welcome.

1065
01:30:03,080 --> 01:30:04,991

- Not when it come to you, Angela.

1071
01:30:41,400 --> 01:30:44,756
Sure. I suppose I could squeeze you in.

1072
01:30:49,480 --> 01:30:51,948
I see your arm is all healed. Lay back.

1073

OK.

Uh...

You know, Angela... Ive been thinking...

Mm. Well, there you go.
Workin without tools again.

1077

You know, Ive been thinking, too.

You know...

I fell for you like a ton of bricks.

I bared my soul to you.

1081

I trusted you. You lied to me.

1082
01:31:18,200 --> 01:31:20,919
Then... you almost had me killed.

1083
01:31:23,840 --> 01:31:25,796
But...

1084
01:31:27,840 --> 01:31:29,876
I can't stop thinkin' about...

1085
01:31:32,640 --> 01:31:35,598
what you said to me
that night at my apartment.

1086
01:31:36,880 --> 01:31:40,555
Maybe everyone does
deserve a second chance.

1087
01:31:40,680 --> 01:31:42,272
Ow!

1088
01:31:42,400 --> 01:31:44,356
Even you.

1089
01:31:48,920 --> 01:31:50,876
You want one?

1090
01:31:54,520 --> 01:31:56,670
Yeah. I want one.

1091
01:31:57,920 --> 01:32:00,070
I'll think about it.

1092
01:39:21,280 --> 01:39:23,555
