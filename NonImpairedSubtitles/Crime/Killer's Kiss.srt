1
00:11:46,832 --> 00:11:50,586
(steam train)

2
00:12:08,020 --> 00:12:12,900
(PA) The Silver Arrow
for Pittsburgh and Chicago

3
00:12:13,025 --> 00:12:16,153
leaving at one o'clock.

4
00:12:16,236 --> 00:12:18,447
(train whistle)

5
00:12:18,655 --> 00:12:21,158
(PA announcement continues)

6
00:12:35,964 --> 00:12:37,925
(bell ringing)

7
00:13:15,254 --> 00:13:19,007
(man) It's crazy how you can get
yourself in a mess sometimes

8
00:13:19,132 --> 00:13:22,261
and not even be able to think
about it with any sense,

9
00:13:22,469 --> 00:13:26,098
and yet not be able to think
about anything else.

10
00:13:26,223 --> 00:13:29,768
You get so you're no good
for anything or anybody.

11
00:13:29,852 --> 00:13:32,896
Maybe it begins by taking life too serious.

12
00:13:33,730 --> 00:13:36,650
Anyway, I think that's
the way it began for me,

13
00:13:37,693 --> 00:13:41,446
just before my fight with
Rodriguez, three days ago.

14
00:15:46,154 --> 00:15:47,823
(phone rings)

15
00:15:48,448 --> 00:15:49,992
- Hello?
- Hello, Davey.

16
00:15:50,117 --> 00:15:52,202
- What kept you?
- How are you?

17
00:15:52,286 --> 00:15:55,539
OK, but it's getting late.
I hate to wait around like this.

18
00:15:55,622 --> 00:16:01,044
You better hop a cab. I had some trouble
with the car. I'll meet you at the arena.

19
00:16:01,170 --> 00:16:03,255
- OK.
- Right. Bye.

20
00:18:18,265 --> 00:18:21,310
- You're doing all right for yourself.
- What do you mean?

21
00:18:22,644 --> 00:18:25,564
- Oh, he just lives in the building.
- Oh.

22
00:18:25,772 --> 00:18:28,275
- Used to be a pretty good fighter.
- A fighter?

23
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:30,068
Sure.

24
00:18:30,152 --> 00:18:34,531
He's fighting tonight, as a matter of fact.
We can watch him on the TV.

25
00:18:48,003 --> 00:18:49,546
(man) Dear Davey,

26
00:18:49,671 --> 00:18:52,257
we still haven't heard
from you yet this month,

27
00:18:52,382 --> 00:18:55,719
and we wondered whether
everything was still all right with you.

28
00:18:55,928 --> 00:18:58,514
Out here everything's about the same.

29
00:18:58,639 --> 00:19:03,227
I still get into Seattle every week
and the ranch is prospering nicely.

30
00:19:03,435 --> 00:19:08,315
Last week I finally bought
Mr Henderson's chestnut Arabian stallion.

31
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:11,360
Your Aunt Grace's
arthritis is much better.

32
00:19:11,568 --> 00:19:15,531
She can even take short rides
on Jumper now and then.

33
00:19:15,739 --> 00:19:19,785
Well, I guess that's all now,
except that we miss you a lot, Davey.

34
00:19:19,910 --> 00:19:23,539
Write soon. Love,
Uncle George and Aunt Grace.

35
00:19:28,043 --> 00:19:30,546
(crowd yelling)

36
00:21:20,656 --> 00:21:23,659
(crowd yelling in background)

37
00:21:54,731 --> 00:21:57,776
(crowd roars)

38
00:22:31,226 --> 00:22:33,645
(TV)... brings together
two very game boys.

39
00:22:33,854 --> 00:22:37,816
The youngster, undefeated in 22
professional encounters, Kid Rodriguez,

40
00:22:37,900 --> 00:22:42,279
and the veteran, Davey Gordon,
who's emerged victorious in 88 fights,

41
00:22:42,487 --> 00:22:44,781
while losing nine and drawing two.

42
00:22:44,907 --> 00:22:47,284
Gordon's long career-he's now 29 -

43
00:22:47,409 --> 00:22:51,371
has been one long promise
without fulfilment, at least thus far.

44
00:22:51,455 --> 00:22:55,834
As hard a puncher as they come, a clever
boxer, he's been plagued by a weak chin

45
00:22:55,959 --> 00:22:59,087
and the unlucky knack of being
at his worst for the big ones.

46
00:22:59,171 --> 00:23:04,801
And tonight is a big one indeed, with
a title bout in the offing for the winner.

47
00:23:04,927 --> 00:23:08,138
Now let's take time out for
a friendly word from our sponsor.

48
00:23:08,263 --> 00:23:10,974
How often have you come home
and wanted to feel the...

49
00:23:55,394 --> 00:23:58,397
(door opens and closes)

50
00:24:18,625 --> 00:24:20,210
(bell)

51
00:24:38,437 --> 00:24:40,314
(crowd roars)

52
00:24:40,439 --> 00:24:41,481
One.

53
00:24:41,690 --> 00:24:42,608
Two.

54
00:24:42,733 --> 00:24:43,775
Three.

55
00:24:43,859 --> 00:24:44,902
Four.

56
00:24:45,027 --> 00:24:46,153
Five.

57
00:24:46,278 --> 00:24:47,404
Six.

58
00:24:47,529 --> 00:24:48,864
Seven.

59
00:24:48,989 --> 00:24:50,532
Eight.

60
00:26:16,451 --> 00:26:18,245
(crowd roars)

61
00:26:18,328 --> 00:26:20,205
One. Two.

62
00:26:20,330 --> 00:26:22,082
Three. Four.

63
00:26:22,207 --> 00:26:24,501
Five. Six.

64
00:26:24,710 --> 00:26:26,378
Seven. Eight.

65
00:26:55,782 --> 00:26:57,534
(crowd roars)

66
00:26:57,659 --> 00:26:59,745
(bell rings)

67
00:27:00,787 --> 00:27:02,748
(din from crowd)

68
00:27:34,988 --> 00:27:37,991
(indistinct announcement on PA)

69
00:27:44,248 --> 00:27:47,167
(TV) Tonight we may have seen
ring history in the making,

70
00:27:47,292 --> 00:27:50,003
in the form of the young
welterweight Rodriguez

71
00:27:50,087 --> 00:27:53,757
and his impressive KO over the
experienced campaigner Gordon.

72
00:27:53,966 --> 00:27:56,885
But, for Gordon, tonight
must come as a bitter pill.

73
00:27:57,094 --> 00:28:00,848
He was to prove that his glass chin
had been remade into sterner stuff,

74
00:28:00,931 --> 00:28:05,102
but, unfortunately for him,
tonight again it was as fragile as ever.

75
00:28:05,227 --> 00:28:09,398
It's a well-known ring adage that
too much education spoils a fighter.

76
00:29:20,093 --> 00:29:22,179
(phone ringing)

77
00:29:32,397 --> 00:29:33,440
Hello?

78
00:29:33,649 --> 00:29:36,151
(woman) Mr Davey Gordon, please.

79
00:29:36,235 --> 00:29:37,819
That's me.

80
00:29:38,028 --> 00:29:40,531
Just a moment. Your party is on the line.

81
00:29:41,448 --> 00:29:44,284
- Hi, Davey. This is Uncle George.
- Hey, Uncle George.

82
00:29:44,493 --> 00:29:46,245
- How are you?
- Fine. How are you?

83
00:29:46,370 --> 00:29:51,041
We're all fine, too. Say, how would you
like to take a vacation out here,

84
00:29:51,166 --> 00:29:55,337
spend a little time with us? Country's
mighty nice this time of the year.

85
00:29:55,420 --> 00:29:57,923
It's really nice of you to ask me out but...

86
00:29:58,048 --> 00:30:01,176
- Dave, we saw the fight on TV tonight.
- So?

87
00:30:01,260 --> 00:30:04,388
- Nothing. We just saw it.
- Must have looked great.

88
00:30:04,596 --> 00:30:08,058
- Well, these things happen.
- I don't know what happened.

89
00:30:08,141 --> 00:30:12,312
Forget it. You need a vacation,
and we haven't seen you for two years.

90
00:30:12,437 --> 00:30:15,023
Why don't you make
a reservation and come on out?

91
00:30:15,148 --> 00:30:17,943
Well, look, I don't know.

92
00:30:18,986 --> 00:30:21,697
Say, look, I feel
a little dopey right now, George,

93
00:30:21,905 --> 00:30:24,408
but... let me think about it.

94
00:30:24,533 --> 00:30:26,910
I'll, uh... I'll call you.

95
00:30:27,035 --> 00:30:31,206
- Wait. You're not hurt, are you, Dave?
- No, no. I'm just tired, that's all.

96
00:30:31,415 --> 00:30:34,418
- Good. Let us know as soon as you can.
- Sure.

97
00:30:35,377 --> 00:30:38,797
- Your Aunt Grace sends her love.
- Tell her the same from here.

98
00:30:38,922 --> 00:30:42,885
OK. As it stands now,
you'll let us know when to expect you.

99
00:30:43,093 --> 00:30:47,055
I certainly will. Thanks for calling.
It was nice hearing from you.

100
00:30:47,264 --> 00:30:49,766
- Take care of yourself.
- You, too. Good night.

101
00:30:49,975 --> 00:30:51,935
Good night, Davey.

102
00:31:50,744 --> 00:31:54,289
(man) Go on home, you lying bum!
You're a bum!

103
00:31:54,414 --> 00:31:57,125
Go on home, boy. I don't...

104
00:31:57,334 --> 00:31:59,211
(woman screams)

105
00:32:00,128 --> 00:32:02,422
(woman screams)

106
00:32:10,264 --> 00:32:12,766
Hey! What's goin' on in there?

107
00:32:33,829 --> 00:32:36,123
(running footsteps)

108
00:32:36,331 --> 00:32:38,709
(door opens and closes)

109
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:45,382
(door opens and closes)

110
00:33:10,741 --> 00:33:13,327
There you go. That's better.

111
00:33:14,703 --> 00:33:16,788
Look,

112
00:33:16,872 --> 00:33:20,626
if you don't mind me...
if you don't mind me asking you,

113
00:33:20,834 --> 00:33:22,920
what happened?

114
00:33:24,296 --> 00:33:27,007
Well, about an hour ago...

115
00:33:27,633 --> 00:33:29,593
(knocking on door)

116
00:33:47,319 --> 00:33:49,112
Well?

117
00:33:50,656 --> 00:33:53,158
What do you want?

118
00:33:53,992 --> 00:33:55,994
I'm sorry.

119
00:33:56,829 --> 00:33:58,705
I really am sorry.

120
00:33:58,914 --> 00:34:02,459
- It doesn't matter now.
- I said I'm sorry. Can't you forgive me?

121
00:34:02,543 --> 00:34:04,628
- No.
- Please.

122
00:34:04,753 --> 00:34:07,965
- Gloria, please.
- Go away.

123
00:34:08,090 --> 00:34:10,175
Get out.

124
00:34:14,555 --> 00:34:16,640
Yeah, that figures to be.

125
00:34:16,849 --> 00:34:20,894
All my life I've always spoiled
the things that meant the most to me.

126
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:24,982
- All my life.
- I don't care. I just want you to get out.

127
00:34:25,065 --> 00:34:27,276
Gloria, can't you understand?

128
00:34:27,359 --> 00:34:30,612
If only you could know
how low and worthless I feel.

129
00:34:30,696 --> 00:34:34,241
- I didn't even know you had any feelings.
- You foolish girl.

130
00:34:34,366 --> 00:34:36,451
I'm mad about you.

131
00:34:36,535 --> 00:34:40,831
I wanna get you outta here. I'll set you
up right. I'll be your slave all my life.

132
00:34:41,039 --> 00:34:44,668
- You couldn't do anything for me.
- Don't forgive me, just tolerate me,

133
00:34:44,793 --> 00:34:48,422
- And let me suffer, knowing how you feel.
- Can't you get it, Vinnie?

134
00:34:48,630 --> 00:34:52,176
To me you're just an old man.
You smell bad.

135
00:34:52,593 --> 00:34:54,803
I'm mad about you.

136
00:34:54,887 --> 00:34:58,640
I can't stand when I see those guys
dancing with you. My insides burst.

137
00:34:58,849 --> 00:35:01,768
- Well, you won't have to see it any more.
- Please.

138
00:35:01,894 --> 00:35:05,647
- Please, just another chance.
- No. No chance, no nothing.

139
00:35:05,856 --> 00:35:08,567
- Please.
- Let go of me or I'll scream.

140
00:35:08,650 --> 00:35:10,319
(screams)

141
00:35:17,326 --> 00:35:21,705
Don't think about it any more.
Why, he won't come back.

142
00:35:21,788 --> 00:35:23,790
Don't worry.

143
00:35:25,334 --> 00:35:27,628
I'm so tired now.

144
00:35:27,753 --> 00:35:31,381
Just close your eyes.
Don't worry about anything.

145
00:35:32,758 --> 00:35:35,135
I'll sit here with you.

146
00:37:35,255 --> 00:37:37,132
(music box chimes)

147
00:38:10,207 --> 00:38:12,167
(Davey) I locked her door and went home.

148
00:38:12,376 --> 00:38:16,046
But first thing in the morning
I went back to see how she was.

149
00:38:16,255 --> 00:38:21,134
My knocking woke her up, but she was all
smiles and invited me in for breakfast.

150
00:38:21,260 --> 00:38:23,846
Over coffee she told me
she had seen the fight.

151
00:38:23,971 --> 00:38:28,433
I suppose that got me started talking
about myself, about what a washup I was,

152
00:38:28,642 --> 00:38:31,979
how I was going back to Seattle
and work on my uncle's ranch.

153
00:38:32,104 --> 00:38:34,273
But when I think back about it now

154
00:38:34,398 --> 00:38:38,360
I realise that, all the time I was talking,
the thing that was really in my mind

155
00:38:38,443 --> 00:38:43,240
was to remember not to ask what it was
her boss Rappalo was so sorry for.

156
00:38:43,365 --> 00:38:46,160
Anyway, let's talk about you.

157
00:38:46,285 --> 00:38:47,744
Like,

158
00:38:48,871 --> 00:38:51,290
who are those people in the picture?

159
00:38:51,373 --> 00:38:55,252
And how did you get messed up
with that dance-hall guy?

160
00:38:55,335 --> 00:38:57,212
What's the matter?

161
00:38:57,337 --> 00:38:58,797
Nothing.

162
00:38:58,881 --> 00:39:03,802
Just that... so funny you should
ask those questions that way.

163
00:39:04,011 --> 00:39:06,388
- Together that way.
- Why?

164
00:39:07,222 --> 00:39:10,559
Well, they have both
so much to do with each other.

165
00:39:10,684 --> 00:39:14,521
- How do you mean?
- It's involved. Do you wanna hear it?

166
00:39:14,646 --> 00:39:17,024
If you don't mind telling me, I would.

167
00:39:17,232 --> 00:39:20,486
I don't mind. For some reason
I feel like telling you.

168
00:39:20,694 --> 00:39:23,405
I've never told anybody before.

169
00:39:28,702 --> 00:39:32,164
This is my father. This is my sister Iris.

170
00:39:32,998 --> 00:39:35,501
But I suppose it's really Iris's story.

171
00:39:36,210 --> 00:39:40,088
She was a ballet dancer,
and everyone said she was very good.

172
00:39:40,797 --> 00:39:44,551
She adored Daddy,
and of course she was his favourite.

173
00:39:44,676 --> 00:39:47,596
But let me start from the beginning.

174
00:39:47,679 --> 00:39:49,973
Iris was eight years old.

175
00:39:50,098 --> 00:39:52,809
Father was a writer
with a growing reputation,

176
00:39:53,101 --> 00:39:56,438
and Mother was very beautiful
and very intelligent.

177
00:39:56,563 --> 00:40:00,108
They loved each other very much
and they were very happy.

178
00:40:00,943 --> 00:40:04,905
Then I was born and
my mother died on the same day.

179
00:40:04,988 --> 00:40:08,742
They say Father went on
a two-week drunk to celebrate the event.

180
00:40:08,867 --> 00:40:13,038
And after that I don't think
he ever thought of another woman.

181
00:40:13,872 --> 00:40:17,835
Time passed and Iris grew
more beautiful each day.

182
00:40:17,918 --> 00:40:22,214
She was the image of her mother.
Everyone said so.

183
00:40:22,297 --> 00:40:26,385
Iris was Daddy's favourite,
and I was very jealous.

184
00:40:26,593 --> 00:40:29,513
And maybe I began to hate her.

185
00:40:29,721 --> 00:40:32,850
Daddy was good to me.
Maybe he loved me a little, too.

186
00:40:33,058 --> 00:40:36,395
By the time she was 20,
she was dancing with the Ballets Russes,

187
00:40:36,603 --> 00:40:39,189
and Daddy was so proud of her.

188
00:40:39,314 --> 00:40:43,694
And then - I remember the day clearly -
it was my thirteenth birthday,

189
00:40:43,902 --> 00:40:45,988
Sunday afternoon.

190
00:40:46,071 --> 00:40:50,033
Iris came home excited
and told us of her marriage proposal.

191
00:40:50,159 --> 00:40:55,038
The man wasn't bad-looking,
in his early thirties, and very rich.

192
00:40:55,164 --> 00:40:57,249
Father knew him and liked him,

193
00:40:57,332 --> 00:41:00,878
but he couldn't stop laughing
when Iris told how she said no,

194
00:41:01,003 --> 00:41:06,008
simply because the fellow wanted her to
give up her dancing and just be his wife.

195
00:41:06,216 --> 00:41:09,553
She never said if she loved him or not.

196
00:41:09,636 --> 00:41:14,641
Then, a few months later,
Daddy took sick and didn't get better.

197
00:41:14,766 --> 00:41:17,060
And it turned out that he never would,

198
00:41:17,144 --> 00:41:20,397
and that he would need constant
medical care until the end.

199
00:41:20,606 --> 00:41:23,192
Six months to two years, they said.

200
00:41:25,402 --> 00:41:31,658
Iris's salary wasn't enough, and in two
months' time all our savings were gone.

201
00:41:31,950 --> 00:41:34,661
I couldn't work. I was only 1 3,

202
00:41:34,870 --> 00:41:37,289
still in grade school.

203
00:41:37,706 --> 00:41:40,626
The next thing I knew,
she married her rich suitor,

204
00:41:40,709 --> 00:41:45,506
and we were all living in great style
on his estate in Long Island.

205
00:41:45,631 --> 00:41:51,470
Daddy had the best care money could
buy, and he seemed happy despite it all.

206
00:41:51,553 --> 00:41:54,890
Iris gave up her dancing,
according to the marriage bargain,

207
00:41:55,098 --> 00:41:58,435
and did little else
but sit at Daddy's bedside.

208
00:41:58,852 --> 00:42:03,232
Sick as he was, he always laughed
a lot when they were together.

209
00:42:03,357 --> 00:42:06,068
I guess I hated her more than ever now.

210
00:42:10,113 --> 00:42:12,407
A year passed like that.

211
00:42:12,533 --> 00:42:16,995
Her husband was a sweet man, but
none of us paid much attention to him.

212
00:42:17,204 --> 00:42:20,332
And by then I'm sure
he knew she didn't love him.

213
00:42:20,541 --> 00:42:23,168
But he never said anything.

214
00:42:23,252 --> 00:42:28,257
Then one cold winter morning the maid
woke us and said that Daddy was dead.

215
00:42:29,007 --> 00:42:32,845
Iris was like a stone.
She didn't even blink.

216
00:42:32,970 --> 00:42:36,306
I began to cry and shout that I hated her,

217
00:42:36,515 --> 00:42:41,395
that she had only pretended with Daddy,
and that she didn't ever love him.

218
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:43,814
She didn't say a word.

219
00:42:43,897 --> 00:42:49,319
In his room she stood quietly over
his body for a long time and smiled.

220
00:42:50,279 --> 00:42:53,907
Then she went up to her room
and put on their favourite record.

221
00:42:54,032 --> 00:42:58,078
It was from one of her ballets.
She played it very loud.

222
00:42:59,037 --> 00:43:03,834
A short time later her husband found her
in bed, the covers drawn up to her neck.

223
00:43:03,917 --> 00:43:06,962
She'd cut her wrists and she was dead.

224
00:43:08,422 --> 00:43:10,716
She left me a note.

225
00:43:13,635 --> 00:43:15,929
Said she loved me.

226
00:43:16,138 --> 00:43:19,349
She was sorry for making
a mess of everything between us.

227
00:43:20,726 --> 00:43:23,854
Later, I was in the city
attending to some legal things,

228
00:43:23,937 --> 00:43:26,356
and I happened to pass the dance hall.

229
00:43:26,440 --> 00:43:29,359
Sign read "Pleasureland.
Dancing partners wanted."

230
00:43:29,985 --> 00:43:34,907
I don't know what possessed me.
I went up. I actually took the job.

231
00:43:36,033 --> 00:43:38,744
I don't understand any part of it.

232
00:43:38,869 --> 00:43:42,080
Every night I worked
in that depraved place,

233
00:43:42,206 --> 00:43:44,500
a human zoo.

234
00:43:45,334 --> 00:43:50,214
I kept thinking "At least Iris
never had... had to dance like this."

235
00:43:52,424 --> 00:43:56,178
And then I started to feel less unhappy.

236
00:43:57,721 --> 00:44:00,432
Come on, let's go out for a walk.

237
00:44:00,641 --> 00:44:03,060
(Davey) We went out for a walk.

238
00:44:03,143 --> 00:44:06,688
I bought her an ice cream
and saw her laugh for the first time.

239
00:44:06,813 --> 00:44:10,150
We must have walked for hours,
and slowly her mood changed.

240
00:44:10,359 --> 00:44:13,779
She became very happy and
optimistic about life in general.

241
00:44:13,987 --> 00:44:17,449
But when I said I was taking
the train back to Seattle the next day,

242
00:44:17,533 --> 00:44:20,035
she got serious again and very quiet.

243
00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:24,623
I didn't know it, but I was already in over
my head and I couldn't have cared less.

244
00:44:24,748 --> 00:44:28,919
We didn't get back until after lunch.
And then in her apartment...

245
00:44:37,344 --> 00:44:39,221
Something's happened.

246
00:44:39,346 --> 00:44:41,515
I know.

247
00:44:41,723 --> 00:44:44,768
- Do you know?
- Sure. You kissed me.

248
00:44:46,436 --> 00:44:50,399
- Is that all?
- That's all I saw. I watched all the time.

249
00:45:18,427 --> 00:45:20,095
I love you.

250
00:45:20,220 --> 00:45:22,514
Love me? That's funny.

251
00:45:24,474 --> 00:45:26,351
Why is it so funny?

252
00:45:26,476 --> 00:45:27,936
Why?

253
00:45:28,145 --> 00:45:31,064
It's a mistake to confuse pity with love.

254
00:45:41,575 --> 00:45:43,660
Look, Gloria...

255
00:45:49,833 --> 00:45:53,253
Looking back now, I don't know
what her reasons were then,

256
00:45:53,378 --> 00:45:55,964
but she agreed to come
out to Seattle with me.

257
00:45:56,089 --> 00:45:59,218
I should have had sense enough
to know it was no good,

258
00:45:59,301 --> 00:46:01,595
and she was so scared
she'd grab at anything.

259
00:46:01,803 --> 00:46:05,682
But I was kidding myself, and all I could
think of was how much I wanted her.

260
00:46:05,891 --> 00:46:09,853
We made reservations and wired Uncle
George to brace himself for a niece.

261
00:46:10,062 --> 00:46:12,356
And then we got our finances together.

262
00:46:13,190 --> 00:46:15,275
(phone)

263
00:46:16,109 --> 00:46:18,278
- Yes?
- This is Louie.

264
00:46:18,403 --> 00:46:23,826
Gloria Price called to say she's
coming in tonight for last week's salary.

265
00:46:23,909 --> 00:46:26,411
You there, Mr Rappalo?

266
00:46:27,162 --> 00:46:29,039
Thanks.

267
00:47:11,999 --> 00:47:13,959
(phone ringing)

268
00:47:23,552 --> 00:47:25,971
- Albert?
- Hello, Davey. How are you?

269
00:47:26,054 --> 00:47:30,017
OK. Have you got enough money on you
to cash my cheque from yesterday?

270
00:47:30,142 --> 00:47:32,227
What's the rush?

271
00:47:32,436 --> 00:47:36,482
I don't feel too good. I think I'll go out
to Seattle and take stock of things.

272
00:47:36,607 --> 00:47:39,818
- Wait a minute, I'll see.
- Thanks. I'd appreciate it.

273
00:47:48,076 --> 00:47:51,830
- OK. Come on over.
- Say, how about, uh...

274
00:47:52,956 --> 00:47:56,835
Pleasureland instead? You know,
that dance hall at 49th and Broadway.

275
00:47:56,919 --> 00:47:58,921
Maybe around eight tonight.

276
00:47:59,004 --> 00:48:01,423
I'll be there, but it has to be 8.1 5.

277
00:48:01,632 --> 00:48:04,426
I'm taking my wife to a show.
I'll just make it.

278
00:48:04,551 --> 00:48:07,471
- Right. I'll see you there. Take it easy.
- OK.

279
00:48:33,205 --> 00:48:35,207
(car horns)

280
00:49:54,328 --> 00:49:56,830
- Still feel the same way?
- Yes.

281
00:49:58,081 --> 00:50:01,210
- I understand you're going away.
- Yes.

282
00:50:01,335 --> 00:50:04,463
- Where?
- That's my business. I came for my pay.

283
00:50:04,671 --> 00:50:08,008
Oh, sure. How much do I owe you?

284
00:50:08,091 --> 00:50:11,136
- A week.
- Can't you tell me where you're going?

285
00:50:11,345 --> 00:50:12,387
No.

286
00:50:12,471 --> 00:50:15,098
- Will I ever see you again?
- I doubt it.

287
00:50:15,182 --> 00:50:17,684
- I couldn't take that.
- You'll have to.

288
00:50:19,061 --> 00:50:21,855
- That's not true.
- Why isn't it?

289
00:50:22,064 --> 00:50:26,568
- I could kill you right here and now.
- Oh, I don't think you will.

290
00:50:27,277 --> 00:50:30,405
- I wouldn't be too sure of that.
- Look, Vinnie, I...

291
00:50:31,240 --> 00:50:33,242
I really am in a hurry.

292
00:50:33,450 --> 00:50:36,245
- For what?
- Somebody's waiting downstairs.

293
00:50:45,337 --> 00:50:48,674
- You going away with him?
- I don't have to tell you anything.

294
00:50:48,757 --> 00:50:51,802
- All the same, you are, aren't you?
- You figure it out.

295
00:50:51,885 --> 00:50:53,887
- Then you are.
- No comment.

296
00:50:54,096 --> 00:50:57,516
- He's a bum. You'll be grubbing for him.
- Is that so?

297
00:50:57,641 --> 00:51:01,186
Sure. Like the man said,
"Can happiness buy money? "

298
00:51:01,270 --> 00:51:04,523
Well, you're a comedian, too.
See what I'm missing?

299
00:51:09,611 --> 00:51:11,697
Get out.

300
00:51:12,239 --> 00:51:15,450
I'm not asking for favours,
but you owe it to me.

301
00:51:17,244 --> 00:51:19,329
Get out!

302
00:51:37,681 --> 00:51:38,724
Hey.

303
00:51:39,141 --> 00:51:40,601
Hey.

304
00:51:41,435 --> 00:51:43,604
Come on, give me back the scarf.

305
00:51:45,606 --> 00:51:47,691
Come on. Come on.

306
00:51:47,774 --> 00:51:49,234
Hey.

307
00:51:52,154 --> 00:51:53,614
Hey!

308
00:52:30,025 --> 00:52:31,985
(swing music ends)

309
00:52:47,835 --> 00:52:53,048
Miss? The boss says he's sorry and if you
go upstairs you can collect your money.

310
00:53:45,100 --> 00:53:47,478
What do you guys want?

311
00:53:51,982 --> 00:53:54,067
Who are you?

312
00:53:55,611 --> 00:53:57,070
Here.

313
00:53:57,196 --> 00:53:59,698
Do you want my money? Here, take it.

314
00:54:43,784 --> 00:54:47,454
- Where did you go?
- After my scarf. Did you get the money?

315
00:54:47,538 --> 00:54:49,832
He said no, then gave me
an extra hundred.

316
00:54:50,040 --> 00:54:52,125
Weird. Did you see Albert?

317
00:54:52,251 --> 00:54:54,336
Somebody was here before.

318
00:55:29,037 --> 00:55:33,208
I guess he got tired of waiting.
We'll call him when he gets home.

319
00:55:41,967 --> 00:55:46,054
(Davey) We had ham and eggs and
said goodbye to the bright lights.

320
00:55:46,138 --> 00:55:49,600
Downstairs in the courtyard
I suggested that we each get packed

321
00:55:49,808 --> 00:55:52,102
and I'd come over when I was through.

322
00:57:43,881 --> 00:57:46,175
(distant knocking on door)

323
00:57:47,092 --> 00:57:49,094
(man) Open the door.

324
00:57:52,431 --> 00:57:54,391
Open the door!

325
00:57:59,938 --> 00:58:01,899
- Looks like he's gone.
- Know where?

326
00:58:02,024 --> 00:58:03,775
No, sir.

327
00:58:03,901 --> 00:58:06,487
- Where's he from?
- I don't know.

328
00:58:07,863 --> 00:58:10,782
- When did he leave?
- I don't know.

329
00:58:27,132 --> 00:58:30,886
- How long's he lived here?
- Oh, about a year.

330
00:58:31,094 --> 00:58:34,223
- Give me a hand with this drawer.
- Yes, sir.

331
00:58:37,893 --> 00:58:41,230
- What kind of trouble is he in?
- Bad trouble.

332
00:58:41,313 --> 00:58:44,650
Found his manager's body
an hour ago with his head bashed in.

333
00:58:48,946 --> 00:58:51,323
(policeman) OK. Let's go.

334
00:59:57,973 --> 01:00:00,058
(squawking)

335
01:00:26,001 --> 01:00:28,629
(car door opens and closes)

336
01:00:30,506 --> 01:00:34,676
Good morning, Mr Rappalo. I'm sorry
I missed you at the arena last week, but...

337
01:00:35,177 --> 01:00:38,222
Anyway, Mr Albert
told me to tell you that...

338
01:00:39,556 --> 01:00:42,059
That was my manager you knocked off.

339
01:00:42,184 --> 01:00:44,269
- What?
- Where is she?

340
01:00:44,478 --> 01:00:46,021
- What?
- The girl!

341
01:00:46,230 --> 01:00:48,732
- I don't know.
- You don't know.

342
01:00:50,734 --> 01:00:55,113
I'm gonna count to three, and if you
still don't know I'll blow your brains out.

343
01:00:55,197 --> 01:00:56,990
One. Two.

344
01:00:57,199 --> 01:00:59,493
- A loft on 24th Street.
- How'd she get there?

345
01:00:59,701 --> 01:01:01,870
- Boys were waiting.
- She all right?

346
01:01:01,995 --> 01:01:05,207
Yeah, she's all right. I had to do it.

347
01:01:06,250 --> 01:01:08,961
She saw the boys at the dance hall.

348
01:01:09,169 --> 01:01:11,672
She was a witness.
I thought you were dead.

349
01:01:12,297 --> 01:01:16,176
They grabbed her and made it look
like she'd left. I thought you were dead.

350
01:01:16,885 --> 01:01:20,138
I didn't want murder. It's all gone wrong.

351
01:01:20,222 --> 01:01:22,307
Get goin'.

352
01:02:00,679 --> 01:02:02,681
Get 'em up.

353
01:02:08,937 --> 01:02:11,023
(lift whirs loudly)

354
01:02:13,317 --> 01:02:15,694
Is that you, Mr Rappalo?

355
01:02:16,445 --> 01:02:18,405
Yes, it's me, boys.

356
01:02:42,804 --> 01:02:44,806
Up! Everybody up.

357
01:02:48,018 --> 01:02:50,437
Against the wall and lean on your hands.

358
01:02:57,402 --> 01:02:59,196
Come on.

359
01:03:26,098 --> 01:03:28,600
- How are you, baby?
- I'm OK.

360
01:03:29,935 --> 01:03:32,229
(Davey) I can't get the rope.

361
01:03:32,354 --> 01:03:34,439
Be careful.

362
01:03:39,444 --> 01:03:40,487
You.

363
01:03:40,696 --> 01:03:42,364
Yeah, you.

364
01:03:42,573 --> 01:03:44,533
Untie her.

365
01:04:42,716 --> 01:04:44,718
Listen, Vinnie.

366
01:04:44,927 --> 01:04:47,846
Don't kill me. I don't wanna die.

367
01:04:48,055 --> 01:04:50,849
I'll do anything you say. Anything.

368
01:04:52,309 --> 01:04:54,812
You love him, though, don't you?

369
01:04:54,937 --> 01:04:58,065
I don't know. I don't think so.
I've only known him two days.

370
01:04:58,148 --> 01:05:00,442
Two days!

371
01:05:00,567 --> 01:05:03,278
Please, Vinnie. Please don't kill me.

372
01:05:04,321 --> 01:05:06,615
You said you were mad
about me. Remember?

373
01:05:06,824 --> 01:05:10,035
I'm just an old man and
I smell bad. Remember?

374
01:05:10,661 --> 01:05:12,663
I didn't mean it.

375
01:05:12,871 --> 01:05:15,249
You know I didn't mean it.

376
01:05:34,768 --> 01:05:37,354
- We could go away.
- Sure.

377
01:05:37,479 --> 01:05:41,525
Sure. I got lots of money. We could
have loads of fun someplace. Sure.

378
01:05:41,650 --> 01:05:44,361
London. Paris. Sicily.

379
01:05:44,444 --> 01:05:47,489
- I'll do anything you want.
- Maybe we could get married.

380
01:05:47,698 --> 01:05:50,409
Settle down, have a couple of kids.

381
01:05:50,617 --> 01:05:52,369
Sure.

382
01:05:54,246 --> 01:05:57,791
What do you take me for?
1 4-carat sucker?

383
01:05:58,333 --> 01:06:00,919
You and lover boy
won't put me in the hot seat.

384
01:06:01,044 --> 01:06:04,590
You liked me once. Remember?
Remember how nice it was?

385
01:06:04,673 --> 01:06:08,218
- It could be like that again.
- You're forgetting about him?

386
01:06:08,343 --> 01:06:10,512
- I don't care.
- You could have had anything,

387
01:06:10,721 --> 01:06:14,892
but you were too good for me. So you
come up to my office and get me mad.

388
01:06:15,017 --> 01:06:18,020
I send the boys to work over lover boy.
They grab the wrong guy.

389
01:06:18,145 --> 01:06:21,899
He bangs his head too hard on the
sidewalk. That makes me the sucker?

390
01:06:21,982 --> 01:06:24,485
Not on your life, baby. Not on your life.

391
01:06:27,112 --> 01:06:28,572
Hey!

392
01:06:34,620 --> 01:06:36,997
Don't shoot. C'mon.

393
01:06:42,753 --> 01:06:45,255
Stay with her. Go ahead!

394
01:07:17,996 --> 01:07:20,374
He went down there.

395
01:07:22,459 --> 01:07:25,712
Be careful. It's a dead-end alley.
He'll never get out.

396
01:08:22,311 --> 01:08:23,896
Look out!

397
01:08:29,943 --> 01:08:32,446
Get that down. C'mon, hurry.

398
01:10:17,843 --> 01:10:19,845
Oh! Oh.

399
01:10:20,053 --> 01:10:22,222
- What's the matter?
- My leg.

400
01:10:22,347 --> 01:10:24,433
- Come on!
- I can't.

401
01:11:23,033 --> 01:11:24,785
I got him.

402
01:11:25,744 --> 01:11:27,412
I gotta get outta here.

403
01:13:41,922 --> 01:13:44,299
(siren)

404
01:13:58,689 --> 01:14:01,316
I don't see anything. Do you, Joe?

405
01:14:03,402 --> 01:14:06,196
Let's go up and have a look anyway.

406
01:15:56,640 --> 01:16:00,269
(howling)

407
01:16:06,233 --> 01:16:09,027
(Davey) When the cops came
I took them to free Gloria.

408
01:16:09,153 --> 01:16:11,238
The guy on the roof was picked up later.

409
01:16:11,446 --> 01:16:14,241
On the ride to the police station
Gloria didn't say much.

410
01:16:14,366 --> 01:16:18,745
I guess she was trying to work out in
her own mind why I ran and left her alone.

411
01:16:18,829 --> 01:16:23,542
I don't suppose she thought how I felt,
listening to her talk to Rappalo that way.

412
01:16:23,625 --> 01:16:26,253
At the station
they separated us for questioning.

413
01:16:26,336 --> 01:16:29,256
Five hours later they chalked off
Rappalo as self-defence

414
01:16:29,381 --> 01:16:33,844
and had worked a confession from
the hoods on Albert's murder. I was free.

415
01:16:33,969 --> 01:16:38,140
On my way out, the desk sergeant
said Gloria had left an hour before.

416
01:16:38,223 --> 01:16:42,519
There was no message for me, and I
haven't heard from her or seen her since.

417
01:16:42,728 --> 01:16:45,230
And now I don't suppose I ever will again.

418
01:16:45,314 --> 01:16:48,025
Anyway, I guess
the whole thing was pretty silly. :

419
01:16:48,150 --> 01:16:50,861
know a girl for two days and fall in love.

420
01:16:51,069 --> 01:16:55,449
So I cashed my cheque, sent flowers
to Albert's widow, cleaned up,

421
01:16:55,532 --> 01:16:57,409
and here I am.

422
01:16:57,618 --> 01:16:59,286
(PA) The Pathfinder

423
01:16:59,495 --> 01:17:03,040
