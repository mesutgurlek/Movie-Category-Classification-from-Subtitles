"The Accountant (2016)" ^ (Run time 02:03:46)

2
00:00:39,393 --> 00:00:41,239
What the fuck?

3
00:00:42,616 --> 00:00:45,133
Wait, let me call it in!

4
00:00:47,410 --> 00:00:49,051
Move back!

5
00:01:00,010 --> 00:01:01,857
Why are you doing this?

6
00:01:08,144 --> 00:01:10,163
Take that, motherfucker!

7
00:01:26,950 --> 00:01:28,377
Please.

8
00:01:28,402 --> 00:01:30,268
.

9
00:01:30,293 --> 00:01:32,193
Put your gun down!

10
00:01:34,851 --> 00:01:36,437
Come on.

11
00:01:37,366 --> 00:01:38,887
Please.

12
00:01:39,161 --> 00:01:42,068
I'm fucking begging you.
I didn't touch him.

13
00:01:42,093 --> 00:01:43,876
I didn't touch that old man.

14
00:01:43,901 --> 00:01:45,202
I wasn't even...

15
00:02:09,367 --> 00:02:13,331
the accountant

16
00:02:24,084 --> 00:02:26,383
Justine, please.

17
00:02:29,798 --> 00:02:33,018
It's called “stimming.”
It's self-stimulation

18
00:02:33,187 --> 00:02:37,193
Where as, you and I might
tap our fingers, grind our teeth,

19
00:02:37,218 --> 00:02:40,829
bite our nails.
Your son rocks back and forth.

20
00:02:40,854 --> 00:02:43,847
It's more obvious,
but perfectly natural.

21
00:02:43,872 --> 00:02:47,502
We came here, because we heard
you specialized in, in...

22
00:02:47,527 --> 00:02:49,967
What is it?
What does he have?

23
00:02:49,992 --> 00:02:52,557
Mm, not a fan of labels, ma'am.

24
00:02:52,932 --> 00:02:55,651
Your son is a remarkable young man.

25
00:02:55,676 --> 00:02:58,609
Who goes crazy when
you turn the vacuum on.

26
00:02:58,634 --> 00:03:01,923
Wears one Tee-shirt.
Won't let you hug him.

27
00:03:01,948 --> 00:03:05,674
Loud noises, bright lights
can be especially difficult

28
00:03:05,699 --> 00:03:07,238
for someone like your son.

29
00:03:07,263 --> 00:03:11,228
The shirt, most likely fabric sensitivity.

30
00:03:11,277 --> 00:03:16,965
Hugging, closeness, touching,
that can be a challenge, yes.

31
00:03:16,990 --> 00:03:21,006
When it's somebody else's child,
it's a challenge.

32
00:03:21,031 --> 00:03:24,629
When it's yours,
it's a problem.

33
00:03:25,057 --> 00:03:28,130
My practice focuses on education.

34
00:03:28,155 --> 00:03:31,011
I like to work with your son
at his speed.

35
00:03:31,036 --> 00:03:34,442
Help him develop the skills
he'll need to live a full life.

36
00:03:34,467 --> 00:03:38,722
Communicating, eye contact,
understanding non-verbal cues;

37
00:03:38,747 --> 00:03:40,120
making friends.

38
00:03:40,150 --> 00:03:43,033
The only friend he has
is his little brother.

39
00:03:43,654 --> 00:03:46,819
I'm sure moving from
base to base doesn't help.

40
00:03:47,409 --> 00:03:51,635
My husband's in the Army,
which means we all are.

41
00:03:52,264 --> 00:03:55,428
Would you be willing to let your son
stay with us for the summer.

42
00:03:55,453 --> 00:03:59,134
Free of charge, working with me
in a sensory-friendly environment.

43
00:03:59,159 --> 00:04:01,186
That's not going to happen.

44
00:04:01,767 --> 00:04:05,724
If loud noises and bright lights
bother him, he needs more of it,

45
00:04:05,749 --> 00:04:07,468
not less.

46
00:04:07,516 --> 00:04:10,689
The world is not a
sensory-friendly place

47
00:04:10,714 --> 00:04:13,386
and that's where he needs
to learn where to live.

48
00:04:14,627 --> 00:04:16,256
Not in here.

49
00:04:16,570 --> 00:04:18,742
Doctor, in your opinion.

50
00:04:18,767 --> 00:04:21,642
Can our son lead a normal life?

51
00:04:22,348 --> 00:04:24,322
Define normal.

52
00:04:24,921 --> 00:04:26,841
I need to finish.
I need to finish.

53
00:04:26,866 --> 00:04:29,777
Solomon Grundy, born on a Monday,

54
00:04:29,802 --> 00:04:32,687
Christened on Tuesday,
Married on Wednesday,

55
00:04:32,712 --> 00:04:35,446
Took ill on Thursday,
Grew worse on Friday,

56
00:04:35,471 --> 00:04:38,880
Died on Saturday,
Buried on Sunday.

57
00:04:39,673 --> 00:04:40,829
I need to finish.

58
00:04:40,854 --> 00:04:43,615
Solomon Grundy, born on a Monday,

59
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:46,470
Christened on Tuesday,
Married on Wednesday,

60
00:04:46,494 --> 00:04:49,150
Took ill on Thursday,
Grew worse on Friday,

61
00:04:49,175 --> 00:04:51,685
Died on Saturday...

62
00:04:51,710 --> 00:04:54,129
Buried on Sunday.

63
00:05:23,755 --> 00:05:24,785
I...

64
00:05:24,810 --> 00:05:26,868
I never thought of
myself as a quitter.

65
00:05:26,893 --> 00:05:29,945
I'm a...
4th generation farmer.

66
00:05:31,208 --> 00:05:35,298
But, between...
the property taxes and

67
00:05:35,518 --> 00:05:38,844
fertilizer cost,
insurance.

68
00:05:41,412 --> 00:05:44,241
Ah, the hell with it.

69
00:05:44,266 --> 00:05:46,812
What if...
just temporarily mind you,

70
00:05:46,837 --> 00:05:50,432
we put this year's taxes
on our credit card?

71
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:58,990
Do you like it?
I made it myself.

72
00:05:59,015 --> 00:06:01,016
No, not particularly.

73
00:06:01,655 --> 00:06:02,995
You ever sell one?

74
00:06:03,020 --> 00:06:04,658
At church fairs now and again.

75
00:06:04,683 --> 00:06:07,793
Mrs Rice, you may have what the IRS
calls a “a home-based business.”

76
00:06:07,818 --> 00:06:10,066
What room do you use in your house
when you made those?

77
00:06:10,091 --> 00:06:12,978
I don't, really.
Just wherever I happen to be, I guess,

78
00:06:13,003 --> 00:06:15,860
in front of the TV,
at the kitchen table...

79
00:06:15,885 --> 00:06:18,125
I'll spread my beads out in the dining room
but Frank...

80
00:06:18,150 --> 00:06:20,132
Yes, it would be better if
you could try to remember

81
00:06:20,157 --> 00:06:23,364
the one specific space
that you use.

82
00:06:23,389 --> 00:06:25,660
Your home is 29,13 square feet.

83
00:06:25,684 --> 00:06:28,628
IRS code allows us to deduct
from your taxable income

84
00:06:28,653 --> 00:06:31,480
a percentage of your work space
relative to your overall...

85
00:06:31,505 --> 00:06:33,020
- What?
- Mr Rice.

86
00:06:33,045 --> 00:06:36,885
How big is your dining room,
Mrs Rice's office?

87
00:06:36,910 --> 00:06:39,521
I wouldn't so much
as call it an office...

88
00:06:40,828 --> 00:06:45,269
It's...
approximately 200 uh...

89
00:06:50,519 --> 00:06:52,917
- Make it 300 square feet.
- Excellent.

90
00:06:52,942 --> 00:06:55,079
- Mrs Rice.
- Dolores.

91
00:06:55,111 --> 00:06:58,480
Dolores, when you order supplies,
do you order online?

92
00:06:58,505 --> 00:07:01,260
I don't, I just run over
to the beads store.

93
00:07:01,285 --> 00:07:02,377
Example?

94
00:07:02,402 --> 00:07:05,352
I drive, the truck.

95
00:07:06,030 --> 00:07:07,910
The company truck.

96
00:07:26,102 --> 00:07:27,524
Come in.

97
00:07:29,951 --> 00:07:33,360
Mr. King, you've wandered so far
outside your legal purview.

98
00:07:33,385 --> 00:07:37,814
As the president of Southern Trust Bank,
I intend to protect my customer's privacy...

99
00:07:37,839 --> 00:07:41,305
Stop talking. You have a very
cavalier attitude for the president of a bank

100
00:07:41,330 --> 00:07:43,181
with such a piss poor capital cushion.

101
00:07:43,206 --> 00:07:46,581
Now, I want a record of every transaction
Abayed has had for the last two years;

102
00:07:46,606 --> 00:07:49,561
deposits, withdrawals, 
cashier checks, credit cards.

103
00:07:49,586 --> 00:07:52,967
Birmingham or Bahrain,
it is now Treasury business.

104
00:07:52,992 --> 00:07:54,563
Good bye.

105
00:07:54,588 --> 00:07:56,161
Medina.

106
00:07:56,165 --> 00:07:59,302
- Am I saying that correctly?
- Uh, Medina, yes sir.

107
00:07:59,327 --> 00:08:02,258
I've read all your case files,
Director King.

108
00:08:02,283 --> 00:08:05,218
It's impressive work.
Very.

109
00:08:05,228 --> 00:08:08,276
Marybeth Ascension Medina.

110
00:08:08,301 --> 00:08:13,211
Graduated University of Baltimore cum laude
with a degree in criminal justice.

111
00:08:13,236 --> 00:08:15,204
2 years Baltimore PD as an analyst.

112
00:08:15,205 --> 00:08:18,174
2 more at Homeland,
analyst again.

113
00:08:18,208 --> 00:08:21,908
And the last 5 years
here at Treasury.

114
00:08:21,933 --> 00:08:23,596
Analyst.

115
00:08:24,214 --> 00:08:27,933
You did the heavy lifting on
Agent Lorenz's case last month.

116
00:08:28,251 --> 00:08:30,427
I worked on it, yeah
but Agent Lorenz...

117
00:08:30,452 --> 00:08:33,716
Why haven't you applied
for promotion to agent?

118
00:08:33,741 --> 00:08:35,933
You've already doing the work.

119
00:08:36,192 --> 00:08:38,026
Analyst is a good fit.

120
00:08:38,051 --> 00:08:39,837
And I enjoy the work.

121
00:08:39,862 --> 00:08:41,496
So...

122
00:08:43,470 --> 00:08:46,105
Well, you're a liar, Medina.

123
00:08:48,884 --> 00:08:55,270
Ward to the State of Maryland's foster care and
Juvenile Detention System from age 11 to 18.

124
00:08:55,295 --> 00:08:58,912
Weapons chargers,  assault and battery.

125
00:08:59,010 --> 00:09:02,292
Ouch, attempted murder.

126
00:09:05,833 --> 00:09:08,160
Those records are sealed.

127
00:09:09,772 --> 00:09:11,899
Is that a 9mm?
(Tattoo)

128
00:09:13,570 --> 00:09:14,634
.45

129
00:09:14,659 --> 00:09:17,953
You better sit your ass back down
in that chair, young lady.

130
00:09:19,041 --> 00:09:21,281
This is a big moment for you.

131
00:09:22,339 --> 00:09:24,420
Make a good choice.

132
00:09:34,177 --> 00:09:39,370
Lying on a federal employment application
is a felony.

133
00:09:41,086 --> 00:09:42,280
So, right now,

134
00:09:42,305 --> 00:09:46,450
I'm the only thing standing between you
and significant prison time.

135
00:09:50,222 --> 00:09:51,968
What do you want?

136
00:09:52,899 --> 00:09:56,460
Do you like puzzles,
Marybeth Medina?

137
00:09:59,115 --> 00:10:02,107
I meant what I said, son,
you're welcome out to the place anytime.

138
00:10:02,132 --> 00:10:05,915
Do you fish? I got a two-acre pond
that is just thick with catfish and bass.

139
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:08,147
I don't fish.
I shoot.

140
00:10:08,172 --> 00:10:12,204
Oh well, the farm's a perfect place
to do a little plinkin'. So...

141
00:10:12,799 --> 00:10:16,368
Well, thank you.

142
00:10:17,065 --> 00:10:18,686
You take care, son.

143
00:10:18,711 --> 00:10:20,484
Thank you.

144
00:10:24,263 --> 00:10:27,305
My daughter is meeting me for lunch.
I think you two just might hit it off.

145
00:10:27,330 --> 00:10:29,264
Nice to see you.

146
00:10:31,207 --> 00:10:32,603
Already enhanced.

147
00:10:32,628 --> 00:10:36,048
It was taken 3 years ago in Antwerp
by an undercover Interpol agent.

148
00:10:36,073 --> 00:10:37,772
Their target's on the far right.

149
00:10:37,797 --> 00:10:39,958
Yeah, Zalmay Atta.

150
00:10:40,365 --> 00:10:41,818
Go on.

151
00:10:42,113 --> 00:10:44,484
Run the world's largest opium pipe line.

152
00:10:44,509 --> 00:10:47,290
Ties to Karzai, Ghani,Taliban.

153
00:10:47,315 --> 00:10:50,192
I mean he was considered untouchable.

154
00:10:50,193 --> 00:10:53,037
Look at the rest.
Tell me what you see?

155
00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:03,692
I remember most of these arrests...
they were huge.

156
00:11:03,717 --> 00:11:06,436
Focus.
They're all not arrest.

157
00:11:20,190 --> 00:11:21,562
It's the same man.

158
00:11:21,587 --> 00:11:23,562
Lou Carrol.

159
00:11:24,751 --> 00:11:26,729
For what it's worth.
It's an alias.

160
00:11:26,754 --> 00:11:29,074
The Hong Kong photo
was backed about 5 years.

161
00:11:29,099 --> 00:11:32,015
And that one, he's Carl Gauss.

162
00:11:32,731 --> 00:11:36,683
Tokyo, Tel Aviv, Nepal,
there was a sighting in Tehran.

163
00:11:36,708 --> 00:11:38,479
All describing the same man:

164
00:11:38,504 --> 00:11:42,062
“an accountant,” “our accountant,”
“the accountant.”

165
00:11:42,087 --> 00:11:45,679
“The Accountant”?
Like, “CPA accountant”?

166
00:11:47,210 --> 00:11:48,615
Okay.

167
00:11:49,097 --> 00:11:51,914
Say you're the head
of the Sinaloa Cartel.

168
00:11:51,939 --> 00:11:56,933
Now, the cartel count their money
by weighing it in eighteen wheelers.

169
00:11:57,058 --> 00:11:59,981
But one sunny Mexican day,
your in-house money-scrubber

170
00:12:00,006 --> 00:12:02,905
comes to you and says
you're thirty million light.

171
00:12:02,930 --> 00:12:06,923
Who can you trust to do the
forensic accounting, track your stolen cash?

172
00:12:06,948 --> 00:12:09,956
Deloitte and Touche?
H&R Block?

173
00:12:10,661 --> 00:12:18,555
You somehow, contact an individual capable
of coming in cold, un-cooking years of books...

174
00:12:18,580 --> 00:12:20,717
and getting out alive.

175
00:12:21,015 --> 00:12:22,360
I retire in seven months.

176
00:12:22,385 --> 00:12:25,866
Before I do,
I need to know who he is.

177
00:12:26,359 --> 00:12:27,442
How he does it.

178
00:12:27,467 --> 00:12:30,201
I mean, who survives
this kind of clientele?

179
00:12:30,226 --> 00:12:32,887
The secrets this guys has.

180
00:12:34,547 --> 00:12:37,774
What exactly do you
want me to do?

181
00:12:38,029 --> 00:12:39,877
Report directly to me.

182
00:12:39,902 --> 00:12:41,654
No other case work.

183
00:12:41,679 --> 00:12:44,523
No other Treasury personnel involve.

184
00:12:44,634 --> 00:12:48,314
By the end of the month,
one of 2 things would have occurred.

185
00:12:48,695 --> 00:12:51,235
Resolution of this case,

186
00:12:53,825 --> 00:12:56,027
or we update your photo.

187
00:14:08,620 --> 00:14:10,542
ZOLOFT 100 mg

188
00:14:43,751 --> 00:14:46,113
Mom! Mom! Mom!

189
00:14:46,138 --> 00:14:47,418
Where are you going?

190
00:14:47,443 --> 00:14:49,247
Mom!
Mom!

191
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:52,573
You just don't care.

192
00:14:52,598 --> 00:14:54,152
You always comply!

193
00:14:54,177 --> 00:14:56,644
Mom!
No!

194
00:14:56,669 --> 00:14:59,006
No!
No!

195
00:14:59,031 --> 00:15:03,321
Mom!
Mom!

196
00:15:03,642 --> 00:15:05,578
Mom!
Where are you going?

197
00:15:05,603 --> 00:15:06,977
- We had help!
- Then stay.

198
00:15:07,002 --> 00:15:09,243
- You threw it away!
- Stay here, don't go anywhere.

199
00:15:13,409 --> 00:15:14,934
- Mom!
- Hey.

200
00:15:16,642 --> 00:15:18,640
Hey.
Hey.

201
00:15:21,005 --> 00:15:22,371
That's it.

202
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:28,633
There we go.
There we go.

203
00:15:29,356 --> 00:15:31,599
The Solomon Grundy rhyme.

204
00:15:31,624 --> 00:15:34,324
- We're going over it, okay?
- Solomon Grundy.

205
00:15:34,349 --> 00:15:35,688
- Alright?
- Born on a Monday,

206
00:15:35,713 --> 00:15:37,859
Christened on Tuesday,

207
00:15:37,884 --> 00:15:40,226
-There we go.
- Married on Wednesday,

208
00:15:40,251 --> 00:15:42,205
Took ill on Thursday,

209
00:15:42,230 --> 00:15:45,540
Worse on Friday,
Died on Saturday,

210
00:15:45,565 --> 00:15:47,570
Buried on Sunday.

211
00:15:47,718 --> 00:15:50,579
This is the end
Of Solomon Grundy.

212
00:15:50,604 --> 00:15:52,321
Daddy'll hold you.

213
00:16:34,981 --> 00:16:38,046
Looks like somebody's seen 
too many westerns.

214
00:16:38,793 --> 00:16:40,973
Yeah, he must be what...

215
00:16:41,964 --> 00:16:44,011
a mile out?

216
00:16:45,722 --> 00:16:48,711
Not on my best day c...

217
00:17:01,687 --> 00:17:03,634
Holy shit.

218
00:18:35,896 --> 00:18:38,038
Okay, listen to me.

219
00:18:38,063 --> 00:18:40,171
In... flec... tion, alright?

220
00:18:40,196 --> 00:18:42,164
Listen, just listen to my tone.

221
00:18:42,164 --> 00:18:45,181
I say,
"Oh, you look another year older."

222
00:18:45,201 --> 00:18:48,981
"I don't know if I would ever
going to get out of this fucking place."

223
00:18:49,006 --> 00:18:50,560
And you say.

224
00:18:50,584 --> 00:18:53,571
You're probably right, Francis.
You're extremely most unlikely to survive your...

225
00:18:53,597 --> 00:18:56,644
No, hold on.
That's not what you say.

226
00:18:57,023 --> 00:18:59,219
2 years together every night,
you know.

227
00:18:59,244 --> 00:19:02,679
I give you PhD in black money,
but you got to learn this.

228
00:19:02,704 --> 00:19:04,378
- This is crucial.
- You're frustrated.

229
00:19:04,403 --> 00:19:06,608
- What am I?
- You're frustrated.

230
00:19:06,633 --> 00:19:08,621
That's what I am.
I'm frustrated.

231
00:19:08,646 --> 00:19:10,115
Good, good.
Excellent.

232
00:19:10,140 --> 00:19:12,608
Finally.
Alright, let's do another one.

233
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:15,809
Lights out, ladies.

234
00:19:15,882 --> 00:19:17,650
Lights out.

235
00:19:18,019 --> 00:19:20,501
Names and addresses, go.

236
00:19:20,671 --> 00:19:24,304
Cenyon Ivankov,
79 Primorsky Boulevard, Odessa.

237
00:19:24,329 --> 00:19:29,034
The Meier brothers, Moushein and Tzak,
221 Sherwood Avenue, Jerusalem.

238
00:19:29,059 --> 00:19:32,064
Dominick Rabito,
96 Court Street, Brooklyn.

239
00:19:32,089 --> 00:19:33,431
Ask for Bobby.

240
00:19:33,456 --> 00:19:35,147
Ask for Bobby.

241
00:19:35,184 --> 00:19:37,469
You know, I'm old,
I may be remembering things

242
00:19:37,494 --> 00:19:39,855
a little rosier than they were.

243
00:19:39,879 --> 00:19:43,839
I mean if you want to fill out 1040s
and itemized deductions,

244
00:19:43,864 --> 00:19:48,934
pulling 50 grand a year, I mean it's a living,
because if you go down this road, this road...

245
00:19:48,959 --> 00:19:52,607
You can't go back, you understand?
It's dangerous, do you understand?

246
00:19:52,632 --> 00:19:53,772
I understand.

247
00:19:53,797 --> 00:19:56,599
You find one person
you can trust, just one.

248
00:19:56,624 --> 00:20:01,168
And do not make my mistake,
you keep moving your ass around.

249
00:20:09,270 --> 00:20:11,759
They gave me a new handler today.

250
00:20:12,599 --> 00:20:15,615
I don't like this guy.
He's dull.

251
00:20:16,699 --> 00:20:18,284
Worried.

252
00:20:21,961 --> 00:20:23,908
Yeah, fuck it.

253
00:20:25,766 --> 00:20:27,534
Good night, son.

254
00:20:28,807 --> 00:20:30,884
Good night, Francis.

255
00:20:38,424 --> 00:20:40,787
What about Zurich?
Or Saudi Arabia?

256
00:20:40,812 --> 00:20:42,071
The Swiss are cheap.

257
00:20:42,096 --> 00:20:44,779
Dubai is one thing but we're
too conspicuous in the Kingdom.

258
00:20:44,804 --> 00:20:46,739
- I vote Chicago.
- Why?

259
00:20:46,764 --> 00:20:50,530
There's an update in online chatter,
people looking for you.

260
00:20:50,555 --> 00:20:53,060
- What people?
- The unfriendly kind.

261
00:20:53,085 --> 00:20:55,197
Let try a legitimate client for once.

262
00:20:55,222 --> 00:20:59,204
No cartels, arms brokers,
money launderers, assassins.

263
00:20:59,229 --> 00:21:02,001
I like safe.
I like you safe.

264
00:21:02,026 --> 00:21:05,664
Everyone's hiding something.
At least there's honor among thieves.

265
00:21:05,689 --> 00:21:09,554
There is honor among
Illinois electronic manufacturers.

266
00:21:09,579 --> 00:21:12,846
They're in your current backyard,
no risk of movement.

267
00:21:12,871 --> 00:21:14,546
You'll meet?

268
00:21:14,686 --> 00:21:16,260
Yeah, I'll meet.

269
00:21:16,285 --> 00:21:18,052
One last piece of business.

270
00:21:18,077 --> 00:21:19,368
Just the Renoir.

271
00:21:19,393 --> 00:21:21,309
I don't have a buyer
for the Renoir.

272
00:21:21,334 --> 00:21:25,168
The Pollock can move.
Will you ever let it go?

273
00:21:26,737 --> 00:21:27,757
Hello?

274
00:21:27,782 --> 00:21:31,131
Just the Renoir.
Drop the price.

275
00:21:31,944 --> 00:21:34,123
Heavy sigh.

276
00:21:35,127 --> 00:21:37,931
Go to work, Dreamboat.

277
00:21:44,879 --> 00:21:47,950
Uh, Mr. Wolff, I half suspect
we're wasting your time.

278
00:21:47,950 --> 00:21:49,653
I'm quite sure you're not.

279
00:21:49,678 --> 00:21:51,221
And you know this how?

280
00:21:51,246 --> 00:21:52,880
I'm on the clock.

281
00:21:52,905 --> 00:21:57,622
Well, shit, I hope
we're not wasting ours then...

282
00:21:58,439 --> 00:22:02,887
Look, kidding aside, I think if you saw
our books, you'd run for the hills.

283
00:22:03,714 --> 00:22:06,315
We have an incredibly
complicated accounting system,

284
00:22:06,340 --> 00:22:08,946
depreciation schedules on
hundreds of different items,

285
00:22:08,971 --> 00:22:13,226
full time and contract employees,
Department of Defense classified accounts.

286
00:22:13,251 --> 00:22:14,557
It's a numerical shitstorm.

287
00:22:14,582 --> 00:22:17,574
I'll need to see all those books
for the past 10 years,

288
00:22:17,599 --> 00:22:20,420
bank statements, a complete
list of clients and vendors,

289
00:22:20,445 --> 00:22:23,584
hard copies printed out, my eyes only.
All the information is right here.

290
00:22:23,609 --> 00:22:25,079
Okay, whoa, whoa.
Look.

291
00:22:25,104 --> 00:22:27,949
This all came to my attention
only last week..

292
00:22:27,990 --> 00:22:31,208
Now, a junior cost accountant stuck
her nose where it didn't belong

293
00:22:31,233 --> 00:22:33,275
and obviously had no idea
what she was looking at.

294
00:22:33,300 --> 00:22:35,705
Lamar's overreacting,
there is no missing money!

295
00:22:35,730 --> 00:22:38,141
How long have you been
CFO of this company, sir?

296
00:22:38,166 --> 00:22:39,503
15 years.

297
00:22:39,528 --> 00:22:42,070
I need the books for the
past fifteen, please.

298
00:22:42,071 --> 00:22:44,322
Well, you're goddamn blunt.

299
00:22:44,347 --> 00:22:46,747
I'm Lamar Blackburn's oldest friend.

300
00:22:46,772 --> 00:22:51,732
I've been by his side since he was turnin' out
RC robots that Radio Shack called crap.

301
00:22:51,757 --> 00:22:54,536
I wouldn't take a dime
without his say so.

302
00:22:54,852 --> 00:22:58,279
- You're angry.
- Oh, this is bullshit.

303
00:22:58,304 --> 00:23:01,716
Unusual way of making contact
with you, Mr. Wolff.

304
00:23:02,959 --> 00:23:05,113
You were recommended
by Mansoor Lakhani.

305
00:23:05,138 --> 00:23:08,111
We custom made prosthetics for
this man's daughter.

306
00:23:08,136 --> 00:23:10,321
You may know that she lost
both legs to a car bomb

307
00:23:10,346 --> 00:23:12,976
outside his investment firm in Lahore.

308
00:23:13,546 --> 00:23:18,232
He told my brother, Lamar,
that you were nothing short of supernatural.

309
00:23:19,005 --> 00:23:25,202
Mr Lakhani holds advance degrees
in mathematics from Cambridge and Caltech.

310
00:23:25,755 --> 00:23:28,218
Why does a man
like that need you?

311
00:23:29,078 --> 00:23:31,906
I don't discuss client business.

312
00:23:35,565 --> 00:23:38,597
Carl Gauss -
5 years ago Hong Kong

313
00:23:43,024 --> 00:23:45,752

Lou Carroll -
Colombia , Tehran,  Tel Aviv

316
00:24:02,362 --> 00:24:04,999
Louis Carroll

317
00:25:02,366 --> 00:25:05,721
What do you suppose that
young man is thinking right now?

318
00:25:06,567 --> 00:25:09,517
Why do I still feel my arm?

319
00:25:10,117 --> 00:25:14,207
How did everything
go so wrong so fast?

320
00:25:14,379 --> 00:25:17,661
It's cold.
Turn up the heat.

321
00:25:19,112 --> 00:25:20,658
Christian Wolff, I presume.

322
00:25:20,683 --> 00:25:21,731
Mr. Blackburn.

323
00:25:21,756 --> 00:25:23,265
Lamar.

324
00:25:23,465 --> 00:25:25,067
Lamar.

325
00:25:26,947 --> 00:25:28,697
Come with me.

326
00:25:30,180 --> 00:25:33,975
Are you aware of
Living Robotics' three income streams?

327
00:25:34,009 --> 00:25:38,257
Consumer electronics, next generation prosthetics,
unmanned military applications.

328
00:25:38,282 --> 00:25:41,296
Prosthetics division showed 
tremendous growth over the last 10 years,

329
00:25:41,321 --> 00:25:42,828
it's seems to have matured.

330
00:25:42,853 --> 00:25:45,218
Consumer product is your
highest source of revenue.

331
00:25:45,243 --> 00:25:49,677
followed closely by Defense department
contracts, prosthetics sits on three.

332
00:25:49,702 --> 00:25:53,271
You are well informed.

333
00:25:56,966 --> 00:25:59,958
I never married.
Never had kids.

334
00:26:00,002 --> 00:26:02,290
This company is my child.

335
00:26:02,330 --> 00:26:04,938
That's it, money has never
been a motivation.

336
00:26:04,981 --> 00:26:09,477
Balance sheets,
profit and loss statements.

337
00:26:09,579 --> 00:26:12,953
My mind doesn't function
the way your's works.

338
00:26:12,990 --> 00:26:15,940
I need you to be
my eyes and ears, Chris.

339
00:26:15,965 --> 00:26:20,078
Whatever you need to do your job,
you let me know.

340
00:26:23,902 --> 00:26:25,838
I'll start in the morning.

341
00:26:30,444 --> 00:26:34,440
Zurich, Switzerland.

342
00:26:42,252 --> 00:26:45,174
Son of a bitch.

343
00:26:58,483 --> 00:26:59,987
Excuse me?

344
00:27:00,012 --> 00:27:02,442
Who the fuck
do you think you are?

345
00:27:02,467 --> 00:27:04,914
Do you know who
the fuck I am?

346
00:27:04,938 --> 00:27:06,924
Simon Dewey.

347
00:27:06,956 --> 00:27:10,653
The founder, CEO of Dewey Capital.

348
00:27:10,940 --> 00:27:14,132
American.
Shocking.

349
00:27:14,333 --> 00:27:16,909
I have kidnap insurance,
you obviously know that.

350
00:27:16,912 --> 00:27:18,632
Sorry, but how would I
know that you have...

351
00:27:18,657 --> 00:27:20,961
You people are fucking amazing...

352
00:27:21,705 --> 00:27:23,526
You know, when you interrupt
somebody like that,

353
00:27:23,551 --> 00:27:27,947
it makes them feel that you're just not
interested in what they have to say.

354
00:27:27,957 --> 00:27:29,612
Or maybe you just think
what you have to say

355
00:27:29,637 --> 00:27:31,807
is more important than
what I have to say.

356
00:27:31,832 --> 00:27:33,828
Is that what you think?

357
00:27:36,031 --> 00:27:40,084
That gun,
makes you a big man, does it?

358
00:27:41,055 --> 00:27:42,720
This gun?

359
00:27:42,745 --> 00:27:44,267
Come on.

360
00:27:45,715 --> 00:27:49,954
I'm part of a potent department
of a private security force.

361
00:27:49,979 --> 00:27:53,593
We have a client, it's called a...
European manufacturing concern.

362
00:27:53,618 --> 00:27:56,077
You're shortening their stocks simultaneously,

363
00:27:56,102 --> 00:27:58,806
spreading false rumors regarding
the harm of the company.

364
00:27:58,831 --> 00:28:02,773
The result in declining stock price
has made you your millions, but...

365
00:28:02,798 --> 00:28:04,763
It's been on my client's expense.

366
00:28:04,788 --> 00:28:07,189
They have been forced to cut
hundreds of jobs, Simon.

367
00:28:07,214 --> 00:28:10,941
These are third generation metal workers,
people with families.

368
00:28:10,966 --> 00:28:13,725
Pensions are being rendered worthless
because of you.

369
00:28:13,750 --> 00:28:17,194
But, you'll stop now, correct?

370
00:28:17,575 --> 00:28:18,910
Which company?

371
00:28:18,935 --> 00:28:20,251
Wrong answer, Simon.

372
00:28:20,276 --> 00:28:21,554
Look..

373
00:28:21,579 --> 00:28:22,715
Ow.

374
00:28:22,894 --> 00:28:24,227
It's the same spot, Simon.

375
00:28:24,252 --> 00:28:26,879
Why'd you let me hit you
in the same exact spot?

376
00:28:26,904 --> 00:28:28,437
I don't know what you meant.

377
00:28:28,462 --> 00:28:30,656
We all chose positions
on dozens of companies.

378
00:28:30,681 --> 00:28:32,224
Shit, Simon.

379
00:28:32,249 --> 00:28:35,005
I suppose, you're spreading false information

380
00:28:35,006 --> 00:28:37,935
about more than one company,
and that's what you're doing?

381
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:40,789
You just gonna have to stop
shortening them all.

382
00:28:40,814 --> 00:28:42,937
That's ridiculous.
I can't be expected...

383
00:28:48,498 --> 00:28:52,249
Alright, keep your chin up.
No pouting on my watch.

384
00:28:52,274 --> 00:28:54,072
Yeah, you're a man,
You're just...

385
00:28:54,097 --> 00:28:56,091
You're a man in your own way.

386
00:28:59,214 --> 00:29:00,854
Alright, Simon.

387
00:29:03,713 --> 00:29:06,285
I'm an agonal reader
of the Journal.

388
00:29:06,311 --> 00:29:10,235
So I expect your cooperation
be reflected there.

389
00:29:11,493 --> 00:29:14,835
Simon, are we good?

390
00:29:14,860 --> 00:29:16,356
Yeah?

391
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:21,526
Good boy, Simon.
I'm proud of you.

392
00:30:09,602 --> 00:30:10,747
Hello.

393
00:30:10,772 --> 00:30:11,920
Good morning.

394
00:30:11,945 --> 00:30:14,329
Oh.
Hi.

395
00:30:14,354 --> 00:30:15,780
- Um...
- Hi.

396
00:30:15,805 --> 00:30:19,455
I'm Dana Cummings.
You're... the consultant, Mr. Wolff?

397
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:22,604
- Christian.
- Hi, Chris... tian. Um...

398
00:30:22,629 --> 00:30:23,669
I'm Dana.

399
00:30:23,694 --> 00:30:25,205
Cummings.

400
00:30:25,929 --> 00:30:27,896
Yes.
Um...

401
00:30:27,921 --> 00:30:31,936
These are all the files you wanted.
I cross-reference them

402
00:30:31,961 --> 00:30:34,696
by year and alphabetical.
So...

403
00:30:34,721 --> 00:30:36,387
It must have taken
you all night.

404
00:30:36,412 --> 00:30:38,279
It sure did.

405
00:30:40,608 --> 00:30:43,395
Right.
So...

406
00:30:47,552 --> 00:30:49,071
So.

407
00:30:52,439 --> 00:30:55,106
What do you want, Dana Cummings?

408
00:30:55,133 --> 00:30:58,333
Oh, Mr. Blackburn,
um...

409
00:30:58,903 --> 00:31:00,812
Sorry, he said I should...

410
00:31:00,837 --> 00:31:03,883
I'm the person who first
noticed the missing...

411
00:31:03,908 --> 00:31:07,070
- what I think was the missing money.
- Yes, I understand. I'll find it.

412
00:31:07,863 --> 00:31:11,905
Yeah, I thought we could...
have lunch and...

413
00:31:11,930 --> 00:31:13,173
I brought my lunch.

414
00:31:13,198 --> 00:31:16,173
No, I bring my own lunch too.

415
00:31:16,198 --> 00:31:18,595
I can answer any questions
that you have.

416
00:31:18,620 --> 00:31:20,552
I have no questions.

417
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:24,344
Yeah, okay.
Yeah, you want to...

418
00:31:24,770 --> 00:31:27,437
- make your own assessment.
- Yes, thank you.

419
00:31:28,637 --> 00:31:30,046
Okay.

420
00:31:30,071 --> 00:31:31,497
Um...

421
00:31:31,522 --> 00:31:33,932
I'm in accounting
if you need anything.

422
00:31:33,969 --> 00:31:37,644
There is a...
some donuts there for you.

423
00:31:37,669 --> 00:31:39,554
I don't eat donuts.

424
00:31:40,138 --> 00:31:41,910
Okay.

425
00:31:48,807 --> 00:31:50,649
.

426
00:31:50,953 --> 00:31:55,175
Sir, there's been speculation that
your ability to link banks in South Florida

427
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:59,891
to money laundering efforts of terrorists
are actually the result of a whistle-blower?

428
00:31:59,895 --> 00:32:02,401
Or the NSA?
You care to comment?

429
00:32:02,426 --> 00:32:04,408
Let me turn this over to
the head of my task force

430
00:32:04,433 --> 00:32:07,876
Financial Crimes Director, Raymond King.

431
00:32:12,247 --> 00:32:13,974
Folks.

432
00:32:13,976 --> 00:32:15,709
There's no great mystery here.

433
00:32:15,734 --> 00:32:18,247
Nothing fancy.
Just team effort,

434
00:32:18,272 --> 00:32:22,299
comprised of long hours of
good old-fashioned investigative work.

435
00:32:22,951 --> 00:32:24,496
Question?

436
00:32:31,706 --> 00:32:33,123
Please, Sorkis,
give me something.

437
00:32:33,148 --> 00:32:37,224
I match the face of the man in the photo
to a surveillance video in the NYPD data base.

438
00:32:37,249 --> 00:32:39,097
Wait wait wait...
NYPD?

439
00:32:39,122 --> 00:32:40,905
What did you find?

440
00:32:41,705 --> 00:32:45,731
2006, your guy takes out
2 mob enforcers with a steak knife

441
00:32:45,756 --> 00:32:48,897
he lifted off from an Italian restaurant
down the street.

442
00:32:49,208 --> 00:32:53,488
Then he strolls into a den of stone cold killers
and goes on a 7 mnn killing spree.

443
00:32:53,513 --> 00:32:55,743
Using their own weapons.

444
00:32:57,365 --> 00:32:59,452
Head shot, head shot,
head shot.

445
00:32:59,484 --> 00:33:00,659
Sorkis, stop.

446
00:33:00,684 --> 00:33:03,030
The den of stone cold
killers, where is this?

447
00:33:03,055 --> 00:33:06,051
Ravenite, headquarters of the
Gambino crime family.

448
00:33:06,076 --> 00:33:08,928
He killed Anthony,
"Little Tony" Bazzano.

449
00:33:08,953 --> 00:33:11,782
Forensics list cause of death
as blunt force trauma.

450
00:33:11,807 --> 00:33:14,742
He botched him in the head, once.

451
00:33:14,767 --> 00:33:17,775
- Again, play it again.
- Okay.

452
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:19,275
Hey, hey, hey.

453
00:33:23,389 --> 00:33:25,421
I better call it in!

454
00:33:26,894 --> 00:33:28,823
I also got an audio file here.

455
00:33:28,848 --> 00:33:31,468
Inside of the Ravenite,
it was bugged.

456
00:33:32,638 --> 00:33:34,371
Come on.

457
00:33:34,990 --> 00:33:36,189
Please.

458
00:33:36,214 --> 00:33:37,925
That's Little Tony.

459
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:40,852
I'm fucking begging.
I didn't touch him.

460
00:33:40,877 --> 00:33:42,154
I didn't touch that old man!

461
00:33:42,179 --> 00:33:43,653
Give me the recording ASAP.

462
00:33:43,678 --> 00:33:44,984
I wasn't even...

463
00:33:47,135 --> 00:33:51,154
MB, you're an analyst for Treasury.

464
00:33:51,884 --> 00:33:54,510
What the hell have you
got yourself into?

465
00:34:21,359 --> 00:34:24,513
What do you have to hit
to dent a steel thermos?

466
00:34:26,261 --> 00:34:28,320
It's just old.

467
00:34:33,173 --> 00:34:37,059
How did you, um...
get into financial consulting?

468
00:34:37,085 --> 00:34:42,225
Department of Labor statistics indicate it's
one of the fastest growing professions.

469
00:34:42,250 --> 00:34:46,082
Actuarial sciences are experiencing
a tremendous growth as well.

470
00:34:47,650 --> 00:34:49,218
Okay.

471
00:34:51,662 --> 00:34:54,062
I like the balance of it.

472
00:34:55,137 --> 00:34:59,574
You know, like finding things
that aren't obvious.

473
00:35:00,688 --> 00:35:03,068
Plus my dad was an accountant.

474
00:35:03,912 --> 00:35:05,500
He actually...

475
00:35:06,948 --> 00:35:09,076
You know, he had
the whole schtick.

476
00:35:09,101 --> 00:35:10,719
He..

477
00:35:11,374 --> 00:35:14,267
You know, the little amortization book,
with the green eye-shade.

478
00:35:14,292 --> 00:35:17,064
The, like dorky
pocket protector and...

479
00:35:17,089 --> 00:35:19,263
I've got a pocket protector.

480
00:35:21,696 --> 00:35:25,123
That's a nice one.
I mean, his was dorky, I guess.

481
00:35:25,148 --> 00:35:27,086
Yours is nice.

482
00:35:28,637 --> 00:35:30,662
Yeah, he convinced me to go
into the field.

483
00:35:30,706 --> 00:35:34,411
Because I wanted to study art.
At the Art Institute of Chicago. But...

484
00:35:34,436 --> 00:35:36,148
Art doesn't pay the mortgage.

485
00:35:36,173 --> 00:35:38,691
"Art doesn't pay the mortgage, young lady."

486
00:35:40,009 --> 00:35:42,748
Dad's tastes ran more to
Dogs Playing Poker.

487
00:35:42,784 --> 00:35:44,975
I like Dogs Playing Poker.

488
00:35:45,298 --> 00:35:49,576
Because dogs would never bet on things.
So it's incongruous.

489
00:35:50,938 --> 00:35:53,358
I like incongruity.

490
00:35:57,319 --> 00:36:00,184
Yeah, Dogs Playing Poker is nice.

491
00:36:00,209 --> 00:36:03,939
It's just sort of...
just different.

492
00:36:04,575 --> 00:36:08,273
So I studied accounting at the University
of Chicago. “Where fun goes to die.”

493
00:36:08,298 --> 00:36:09,789
Why?

494
00:36:10,812 --> 00:36:12,453
Why what?

495
00:36:12,478 --> 00:36:15,954
Why does fun go to die at
the University of Chicago?

496
00:36:15,979 --> 00:36:18,606
Oh, no.
It's just an expression.

497
00:36:20,822 --> 00:36:22,585
I'm joking.

498
00:36:26,878 --> 00:36:28,467
Right.

499
00:36:38,298 --> 00:36:40,621
- I'll leave you to it.
- Okay.

500
00:36:40,646 --> 00:36:43,561
Let me know if you need
anything while you're here.

501
00:36:45,371 --> 00:36:48,705
- Have a nice day!
- Yes, you too.

502
00:38:43,799 --> 00:38:46,537
I'm fucking begging.
I didn't touch him.

503
00:38:46,562 --> 00:38:48,548
I didn't touch that old man.

504
00:38:48,573 --> 00:38:49,977
I wasn't even...

505
00:38:57,875 --> 00:38:59,629
Okay..

506
00:39:01,013 --> 00:39:02,881
Give me something.

507
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:06,979
I..

508
00:39:06,988 --> 00:39:12,068
I'm fucking begging.
I didn't touch him.

509
00:39:12,093 --> 00:39:15,255
I didn't touch that old man.
I wasn't even...

510
00:39:53,750 --> 00:39:56,338
<font color="#ff8080">Subfloor Vocal Track Isolated</font>

511
00:40:03,578 --> 00:40:06,741
Solomon Grundy, born on Monday,

512
00:40:06,765 --> 00:40:08,497
Christened on Tuesday,

513
00:40:08,522 --> 00:40:11,591
Born on a Monday,
Christened on Tuesday,

514
00:40:11,616 --> 00:40:15,118
Born on a Monday,
Christened on Tuesday,

515
00:40:15,143 --> 00:40:17,171
Born on a Monday,

516
00:40:31,212 --> 00:40:32,504
Come in. Come in. Come in.

517
00:40:32,529 --> 00:40:34,043
You have to see this.
Look at this.

518
00:40:34,068 --> 00:40:36,186
It's going to blow you away.

519
00:40:36,211 --> 00:40:39,883
I mean, it'll just...
jump right out at you.

520
00:40:41,591 --> 00:40:44,111
- There it is.
- Uh-huh.

521
00:40:44,136 --> 00:40:47,368
Living Robotics, 10 years ago,
earnings before interest, tax, depreciation,

522
00:40:47,393 --> 00:40:50,057
 $14,495,719.

523
00:40:50,082 --> 00:40:54,820
9 years ago. earning
before tax depreciation.

524
00:40:54,945 --> 00:40:57,994
Revenues go up, profits go down.

525
00:40:58,019 --> 00:41:00,569
No large capital expenditures
dragging profits down.

526
00:41:00,594 --> 00:41:03,114
No spike in raw materials
or labor costs.

527
00:41:03,139 --> 00:41:05,492
Year 8, profits and revenue
both go up,

528
00:41:05,517 --> 00:41:08,445
but not at a comparable fashion.
X no longer equals Y.

529
00:41:08,470 --> 00:41:10,269
6, 5, 4, 3.

530
00:41:10,294 --> 00:41:13,214
You're making money
but there's a leak.

531
00:41:13,248 --> 00:41:15,195
The leak is...

532
00:41:15,220 --> 00:41:17,715
The leak.
Where's the leak?

533
00:41:20,922 --> 00:41:22,913
SLEWITT manufacturing.
I signed these checks.

534
00:41:22,924 --> 00:41:24,743
- Who authorized it?
- Ed... Mr. Chilton.

535
00:41:24,768 --> 00:41:27,567
They make electronic assemblies for
the consumer division.

536
00:41:27,592 --> 00:41:30,480
No, they don't.
Look at this.

537
00:41:30,932 --> 00:41:32,821
You notice anything?

538
00:41:34,222 --> 00:41:37,157
- Second number in each is a 3.
- Yeah.

539
00:41:37,182 --> 00:41:40,893
Most people, when generating random numbers
tends to relies subconsciously on certain...

540
00:41:40,918 --> 00:41:42,236
- ... patterns.
- Patterns. Yeah.

541
00:41:42,261 --> 00:41:43,274
Yes.

542
00:41:43,299 --> 00:41:45,333
- I was right.
- You were right.

543
00:41:46,297 --> 00:41:48,148
- Yeah.
- Uh, I'm...

544
00:41:48,149 --> 00:41:52,265
I went through these ledgers for months.
And I got through one fiscal year.

545
00:41:52,290 --> 00:41:54,151
You went through 15.
Overnight.

546
00:41:54,176 --> 00:41:56,754
It's not even the best part, look.
This part is...

547
00:41:56,779 --> 00:41:59,052
They're routing money to a company
that doesn't exist.

548
00:41:59,077 --> 00:42:02,205
And yet profits go up,
and they continue going up.

549
00:42:02,230 --> 00:42:03,730
It absolutely makes no sense.

550
00:42:03,755 --> 00:42:06,191
- Where's the money coming from?
- Where's the money coming from? Exactly!

551
00:42:06,200 --> 00:42:08,716
- It's not inventory?
- Inventory checked out.

552
00:42:08,741 --> 00:42:11,109
- Chargebacks to vendors?
- No, perfectly in order.

553
00:42:11,133 --> 00:42:12,441
Internal offsets?

554
00:42:12,467 --> 00:42:14,265
No, that's a terrible idea.

555
00:42:14,889 --> 00:42:16,287
Um.

556
00:42:22,216 --> 00:42:23,696
Cummings.

557
00:42:23,721 --> 00:42:27,685
You're needed in whatever area
I'm paying you to be needed in.

558
00:42:27,710 --> 00:42:29,341
Sorry.

559
00:42:42,396 --> 00:42:43,960
And?

560
00:42:46,107 --> 00:42:52,239
3 million, three hundred forty five...
6 million, three hundred ninety seven...
12 million...

561
00:42:52,439 --> 00:42:56,916
Sixty one million, six hundred and seventy nine thousand...
$ 61,679,000 ...

562
00:42:57,129 --> 00:42:59,144
and some change.

563
00:42:59,387 --> 00:43:01,811
Who did it?
Best guess?

564
00:43:01,836 --> 00:43:03,859
I don't guess.

565
00:43:05,183 --> 00:43:07,496
You'll have a report for me?

566
00:43:07,727 --> 00:43:10,249
When I'm finished,
yes.

567
00:43:43,236 --> 00:43:44,964
Hey, Ed.

568
00:43:45,620 --> 00:43:47,749
You'll have the lemon meringue pie.

569
00:43:47,774 --> 00:43:50,255
And those two bottles of insulin.

570
00:43:53,908 --> 00:43:59,048
I just thought that you'd appreciate
being treated like an adult, right?

571
00:43:59,073 --> 00:44:00,952
So here's what I got.

572
00:44:05,954 --> 00:44:13,095
You administer your own accidental
insulin overdose, and just die

573
00:44:13,120 --> 00:44:15,038
but do it with dignity.

574
00:44:15,063 --> 00:44:18,074
Your wife whose sleeping upstairs,

575
00:44:18,098 --> 00:44:22,743
she'll be the beneficiary of, what's got to be,
a very generous insurance policy,

576
00:44:22,768 --> 00:44:24,013
 am I right?

577
00:44:24,038 --> 00:44:26,131
But the only way she's going
to collecting that policy, Ed,

578
00:44:26,156 --> 00:44:29,101
 is that we have the
appearance of an accident.

579
00:44:29,110 --> 00:44:33,024
If we lay hands on you,
you're gonna fight, squeal,

580
00:44:33,049 --> 00:44:35,015
she wakes up,
my hands are tied.

581
00:44:35,016 --> 00:44:37,327
One accidental death is just that.
Two?

582
00:44:37,338 --> 00:44:42,352
No, I'll have no choice but to
rock and roll a home invasion,

583
00:44:42,376 --> 00:44:44,201
violate your wife
a dozen different ways,

584
00:44:44,226 --> 00:44:47,054
kill you both, burn the
place to the ground.

585
00:44:48,610 --> 00:44:52,041
I'm sorry for that.
Ed, Ed, Ed, hey.

586
00:44:52,066 --> 00:44:55,098
Nobody's gonna violate your wife, okay?

587
00:44:55,145 --> 00:44:59,186
Besides, what that would say
about me as a human being?

588
00:44:59,211 --> 00:45:01,323
Physiologically, it's a non-starter.

589
00:45:01,348 --> 00:45:06,187
Sometimes I think I just say shit,
say a poop comes out of my mouth.

590
00:45:07,070 --> 00:45:10,226
I will however plug a .45
in your brainpan.

591
00:45:11,077 --> 00:45:13,469
I don't mind commitments.

592
00:45:13,494 --> 00:45:18,298
It's kind of sad you and your
sticky fingers probably find hard to grasp.

593
00:45:23,097 --> 00:45:25,369
Make a decision, sir.

594
00:45:36,472 --> 00:45:39,345
Where are you going?
Sir.

595
00:45:42,788 --> 00:45:44,789
Stop that. Why're you doing that?
Stop that!

596
00:45:44,814 --> 00:45:46,011
Sir.
Sir.

597
00:45:46,036 --> 00:45:47,844
What are you doing?
Excuse me.

598
00:45:47,869 --> 00:45:50,032
Mr. Chilton passed away.

599
00:45:50,057 --> 00:45:52,417
I was told to
clean up the room.

600
00:45:53,016 --> 00:45:54,652
What's happening?

601
00:45:56,224 --> 00:45:58,544
Could you give us a minute, please?

602
00:46:01,315 --> 00:46:03,332
This is the balance of your contract.

603
00:46:03,357 --> 00:46:05,348
- I understand you're upset.
- Yes, I'm upset.

604
00:46:05,373 --> 00:46:08,342
- But I haven't finished yet.
- Yes, you have.

605
00:46:08,342 --> 00:46:10,185
Ed was a diabetic for 30 years.

606
00:46:10,210 --> 00:46:12,800
You think he didn't know how
to check his blood sugar?

607
00:46:12,825 --> 00:46:15,730
Whatever unresolved issues remain,

608
00:46:15,755 --> 00:46:19,487
my friend was poisoned enough
by them to take his own life.

609
00:46:20,152 --> 00:46:22,809
As far as I'm concerned
whatever he did is forgiven.

610
00:46:22,834 --> 00:46:24,430
Please... I need to finish.
Please.

611
00:46:24,455 --> 00:46:27,336
- Sorry, I'll come back.
- No, no. Come in, dear.

612
00:46:28,258 --> 00:46:29,892
We're done.

613
00:46:31,499 --> 00:46:33,751
You're very good, Mr. Wolff.

614
00:46:33,776 --> 00:46:36,817
But, I hope our paths
never cross again.

615
00:46:37,104 --> 00:46:40,325
I'm responsible for the
death of my best friend.

616
00:46:40,720 --> 00:46:43,493
I'd prefer not to be
reminded of it.

617
00:46:54,853 --> 00:46:56,851
Do you think that's true?

618
00:46:57,666 --> 00:47:00,065
That Mr. Chilton killed himself?

619
00:47:00,461 --> 00:47:02,780
That makes you think we're responsible?

620
00:47:03,057 --> 00:47:06,206
It's very hard for me to interpret
what people do what they do.

621
00:47:07,532 --> 00:47:09,034
This...

622
00:47:10,469 --> 00:47:13,396
I'm not finished.
I'm not finished.

623
00:47:14,441 --> 00:47:17,614
I mean look.
Look at this.

624
00:47:18,044 --> 00:47:20,468
SIMOPS reports.
This is out of order.

625
00:47:20,509 --> 00:47:22,398
They completely re-rearrange this.

626
00:47:22,423 --> 00:47:24,008
I'm not...

627
00:47:24,033 --> 00:47:26,280
I'm not finished.
I'm not finished.

628
00:47:31,308 --> 00:47:32,966
Bye, Chris.

629
00:50:13,033 --> 00:50:14,482
Again.

630
00:50:36,395 --> 00:50:38,009
Enough.

631
00:50:42,824 --> 00:50:44,409
They're not done.

632
00:50:44,434 --> 00:50:48,437
Tomorrow is another day.
They have done their best.

633
00:50:48,574 --> 00:50:52,229
If that were true, you would
be covered in blood and stars, not them.

634
00:50:53,304 --> 00:50:54,988
Keep going.

635
00:51:07,181 --> 00:51:11,487
Aggression correctly channel
overcomes a lot of flaws.

636
00:51:13,091 --> 00:51:19,366
To tap into that aggression requires
peeling back several layers of yourself.

637
00:51:20,330 --> 00:51:23,626
It's my job to know
my son's limitations.

638
00:51:24,858 --> 00:51:26,538
Get up.

639
00:51:28,095 --> 00:51:29,802
It's your job to peel.

640
00:51:29,827 --> 00:51:32,641
Do your job.
On your feet.

641
00:51:49,734 --> 00:51:51,244
Get up.

642
00:51:58,659 --> 00:52:00,665
We could have went to his house.

643
00:52:00,690 --> 00:52:03,537
Shot him in his home.
We would be on a plane by now.

644
00:52:03,562 --> 00:52:07,861
On a security camera,
or some nosy neighbor's iPhone.

645
00:52:11,272 --> 00:52:13,380
Call the bookkeeper in.

646
00:52:13,641 --> 00:52:15,831
He's too far,
he won't hear...

647
00:52:15,856 --> 00:52:17,186
- Now.
- ... me.

648
00:52:17,211 --> 00:52:18,968
Let's go.
Get up.

649
00:52:18,993 --> 00:52:20,495
Come on.

650
00:52:22,454 --> 00:52:24,154
Go on.

651
00:52:25,745 --> 00:52:27,556
Come on, come on, come on.

652
00:52:33,193 --> 00:52:35,398
Christian!

653
00:52:38,345 --> 00:52:40,147
Chris!

654
00:52:43,727 --> 00:52:46,101
Again.
Louder.

655
00:52:46,431 --> 00:52:47,748
Chris...

656
00:52:55,833 --> 00:52:57,801
- No! No! Please!
- What the fuck?

657
00:52:57,826 --> 00:52:59,342
Dolores!

658
00:53:01,751 --> 00:53:04,946
- She's coming with me.
- I say, stop it! Leave her be!

659
00:53:04,971 --> 00:53:06,431
Shit!

660
00:53:10,230 --> 00:53:11,589
We're all going together.

661
00:53:11,613 --> 00:53:15,242
Just pull that truck around the back.
Let's go. Let's go!

662
00:53:18,799 --> 00:53:20,315
Let's move.

663
00:53:20,932 --> 00:53:24,087
Come on, drive!
Drive now!

664
00:53:33,970 --> 00:53:36,098
What the fuck?

665
00:54:25,147 --> 00:54:27,288
What the fuck?

666
00:54:39,922 --> 00:54:43,275
When I say the name of your employer,
you say ''Yes''.

667
00:54:43,300 --> 00:54:44,838
Practice.

668
00:54:44,925 --> 00:54:46,369
Yes.

669
00:54:46,927 --> 00:54:51,649
Camorra... Juarez... Gambino...

670
00:54:52,235 --> 00:54:54,331
Do you understand the rules?

671
00:54:54,356 --> 00:54:56,807
My left pocket.

672
00:54:59,725 --> 00:55:02,881
Kill you both,
that's all I know.

673
00:55:24,805 --> 00:55:26,921
- Hello, Dreamboat.
- Dana's in danger.

674
00:55:26,946 --> 00:55:29,801
Kill Christian Wolff.
Transfer all domestic accounts overseas.

675
00:55:29,837 --> 00:55:32,187
- Current vehicle?
- F-150.

676
00:55:32,399 --> 00:55:35,443
- Virus to triple Z?
- Wipe everything.

677
00:55:36,849 --> 00:55:38,914
And... done.
In the D-O-T data base now...

678
00:55:38,939 --> 00:55:40,876
reassigning the license and vin.

679
00:55:40,901 --> 00:55:43,585
I have “George Boole” or
“Charles Babbage” in the queue.

680
00:55:43,610 --> 00:55:45,392
Boole.
Obviously.

681
00:55:45,417 --> 00:55:47,944
Silly of me.
What else?

682
00:55:48,956 --> 00:55:50,452
She is not your problem.

683
00:55:50,477 --> 00:55:53,002
Straight to the trailer,
hook it up and disappear.

684
00:55:53,027 --> 00:55:56,474
There's no time,
only the trailer.

685
00:55:57,169 --> 00:56:00,168
Address and phone number.
Get it.

686
00:56:30,898 --> 00:56:33,059
She's not answering.

687
00:58:03,700 --> 00:58:05,354
We could use a small box.

688
00:58:05,379 --> 00:58:07,537
She looked bigger in the photo.

689
00:58:11,049 --> 00:58:12,491
God!

690
00:58:48,340 --> 00:58:51,691
God damn!
Bitch!

691
00:59:28,654 --> 00:59:30,293
We should go.

692
00:59:35,837 --> 00:59:38,922
Since when are accountants
difficult to ventilate?

693
00:59:40,151 --> 00:59:41,428
Dead?

694
00:59:41,453 --> 00:59:44,799
Are you crazy, what did he do?
Hit him over the head with an adding machine?

695
00:59:48,783 --> 00:59:50,887
Oh God.

696
00:59:52,755 --> 00:59:56,478
Alright, just...
Put me in touch with the client.

697
00:59:56,565 --> 00:59:59,361
I'll handle this accountant myself.

698
01:00:02,023 --> 01:00:04,910
Running isn't an option for me.
I can't just walk out on my life!

699
01:00:04,912 --> 01:00:08,243
We've to go to the police!
That's what normal taxpaying people do!

700
01:00:08,268 --> 01:00:12,444
The police can't protect you from someone
who could afford to return 61 million dollars.

701
01:00:12,469 --> 01:00:14,285
Return?
What are you talking about, "Return".

702
01:00:14,317 --> 01:00:16,250
The money was being put back.

703
01:00:16,275 --> 01:00:17,787
Stay here.

704
01:01:18,871 --> 01:01:19,962
What are you doing in here?

705
01:01:19,987 --> 01:01:22,731
- Who are you?
- You can't... You should not be here.

706
01:01:22,756 --> 01:01:25,282
Sit down.
Sit right there.

707
01:01:28,490 --> 01:01:30,488
What is this place?

708
01:01:31,117 --> 01:01:33,757
Panamerica Airstream.

709
01:01:33,783 --> 01:01:36,577
34 feet 7 inches long.

710
01:01:36,899 --> 01:01:39,402
8 feet 5 inches wide.

711
01:01:39,426 --> 01:01:44,093
The dimensions which are perfectly
adequate for one person, preferable.

712
01:01:45,028 --> 01:01:46,700
This is where you live?

713
01:01:46,725 --> 01:01:48,525
No.
I don't live here.

714
01:01:48,550 --> 01:01:50,892
This is a storage unit.
That would be weird.

715
01:01:50,917 --> 01:01:52,630
That's what would be weird?

716
01:01:52,655 --> 01:01:54,646
I just spend more time here.

717
01:01:54,671 --> 01:01:58,416
However, I'm afraid some of
my clients have followed me.

718
01:01:58,671 --> 01:02:01,898
Why would your clients follow you?
You're an accountant.

719
01:02:01,928 --> 01:02:04,897
How do you know what to do here?
Why are you prepared for this?

720
01:02:04,931 --> 01:02:06,549
Plus, this is on wheels.

721
01:02:06,574 --> 01:02:09,968
Which means I could hook it and
be gone in 12 minutes, usually.

722
01:02:09,993 --> 01:02:12,988
Sarcasm.
Is that sarcasm?

723
01:02:13,013 --> 01:02:16,084
No, that's not sarcasm.
I don't use sarcasm material please.

724
01:02:16,109 --> 01:02:18,899
Everything in the world that
is important to me, is in this trailer.

725
01:02:18,924 --> 01:02:22,065
And I'm not changing my routine
for you to jeopardize that.

726
01:02:26,157 --> 01:02:28,878
Tell me that's not
an original Pollock.

727
01:02:33,355 --> 01:02:34,962
We should go.

728
01:02:37,094 --> 01:02:38,587
Now.

729
01:02:54,047 --> 01:02:55,802
- Medina.
- Ms. Medina.

730
01:02:55,827 --> 01:02:58,666
This is Gordon Amundson
with the FBI Language Services.

731
01:02:58,691 --> 01:03:00,725
Ah, yeah.
Anything luck?

732
01:03:00,750 --> 01:03:02,932
It's an unusual audio file.

733
01:03:02,957 --> 01:03:06,824
Solomon Grundy is a nursery rhyme,
circled in 1800s.

734
01:03:06,849 --> 01:03:11,373
Your voice has four of the six intonation
patterns we use to define American English.

735
01:03:11,398 --> 01:03:14,333
That's difficult to confirm with a rhyme.

736
01:03:14,334 --> 01:03:17,514
Out of curiosity...
was your subject a trauma victim?

737
01:03:17,539 --> 01:03:19,696
Um.
Why you ask that?

738
01:03:19,721 --> 01:03:22,169
Well, you indicated on your submission,

739
01:03:22,194 --> 01:03:25,065
that this event occurred
in a high-stress environment?

740
01:03:25,090 --> 01:03:27,170
Yeah, exceptionally.

741
01:03:27,194 --> 01:03:28,503
That's interesting.

742
01:03:28,528 --> 01:03:32,176
The first was repeated
a total of four and a half times.

743
01:03:32,201 --> 01:03:38,671
Zero variation in pitch, stem, tempo,
volume or articulatory precision.

744
01:03:38,696 --> 01:03:40,901
So what does that mean exactly?

745
01:03:40,926 --> 01:03:45,378
We often see this type of repetitive chanting
in children who have been exposed to trauma

746
01:03:45,403 --> 01:03:48,174
or persons with neurodevelopmental disorders.

747
01:03:48,199 --> 01:03:50,081
"Neurodevelopmental disorders?"

748
01:03:50,106 --> 01:03:52,985
Fragile-X syndrome, autism.

749
01:03:53,009 --> 01:03:56,598
Okay, so, let's say
I was looking at mug shots,

750
01:03:56,626 --> 01:04:00,104
how would that present itself,
what exactly am I looking for?

751
01:04:00,129 --> 01:04:05,248
Fragile-X, elongated face,
protruding ears, poor muscle tone.

752
01:04:05,273 --> 01:04:07,996
Autism is nearly impossible
to identify visually.

753
01:04:08,021 --> 01:04:12,827
The traits are behavioral.
Difficulty with social reaction and communication.

754
01:04:12,852 --> 01:04:15,018
Lack of eye contact.

755
01:04:15,215 --> 01:04:17,582
Lack of eye contact.

756
01:04:18,903 --> 01:04:19,787
Okay.

757
01:04:19,812 --> 01:04:22,326
- Good luck to you.
- Thanks.

758
01:04:51,352 --> 01:04:53,578
Asperger's Syndrome

759
01:04:53,587 --> 01:04:56,321
Mathematician

760
01:05:01,694 --> 01:05:04,677
<font color="#ff9b6a">The Prince of Mathematicians</font>

761
01:05:12,888 --> 01:05:14,647
None of this makes sense.

762
01:05:14,672 --> 01:05:17,999
Why go to the trouble of skimming
the money, if you're just going to put it back?

763
01:05:18,024 --> 01:05:23,662
Over the last 3 years, the number of invoices
submitted by Slewitt Manufacturing had declined.

764
01:05:23,687 --> 01:05:25,889
Scared of getting caught, right?

765
01:05:26,944 --> 01:05:28,091
Price hike?

766
01:05:28,101 --> 01:05:30,522
The prices of consumer electronics go down.

767
01:05:30,547 --> 01:05:33,185
Right. Down, yeah.
Um...

768
01:05:34,581 --> 01:05:35,998
I can't afford this.

769
01:05:36,023 --> 01:05:38,301
I know.
My treat.

770
01:05:40,515 --> 01:05:45,423
In the U.S, 104 men, 
last name any standard derivation

771
01:05:45,448 --> 01:05:48,029
 if you were a mathematician 
called Gauss.

772
01:05:48,054 --> 01:05:53,593
Earn more than over $500,000
in any of the last 7 years.

773
01:05:53,618 --> 01:05:55,951
Okay, go a million plus.

774
01:05:56,773 --> 01:05:58,073
17.

775
01:05:58,098 --> 01:06:02,134
Of the 17, how many
between the age of 25 to 45?

776
01:06:02,353 --> 01:06:03,919
4.

777
01:06:03,944 --> 01:06:06,681
Of those 4, only one
has an income stream

778
01:06:06,706 --> 01:06:09,163
that's cash heavy or easily laundered.

779
01:06:09,188 --> 01:06:10,989
And he...

780
01:06:11,579 --> 01:06:13,531
died 3 years ago.

781
01:06:20,033 --> 01:06:21,087
What's this?

782
01:06:21,112 --> 01:06:24,387
Names of the 100
most famous mathematicians.

783
01:06:25,906 --> 01:06:28,179
Look, we know what we're doing now.
So, just...

784
01:06:28,204 --> 01:06:30,750
enter the names, narrow down
the search right off the map.

785
01:06:30,775 --> 01:06:35,025
Male, Caucasian, 25 to 45.
Earning a million plus.

786
01:06:35,068 --> 01:06:38,717
No investment income,
he'll concentrate on cash.

787
01:06:39,550 --> 01:06:41,236
What's in it for me?

788
01:06:42,369 --> 01:06:44,305
Look, if you help me find him,

789
01:06:44,330 --> 01:06:47,033
I'll see what I can do
about getting you out of here.

790
01:06:48,532 --> 01:06:50,003
Please.

791
01:06:51,066 --> 01:06:53,581
Single avowal or filed jointly.

792
01:07:13,139 --> 01:07:15,423
Hey, those paintings in your trailer,

793
01:07:15,448 --> 01:07:17,931
- They're real, right?
- Yes.

794
01:07:18,292 --> 01:07:20,325
You didn't buy them
at auction. Did they?

795
01:07:20,350 --> 01:07:22,724
They were a form of payment.

796
01:07:22,997 --> 01:07:24,417
Right.

797
01:07:25,402 --> 01:07:26,917
Hey.

798
01:07:26,989 --> 01:07:28,582
Thank you.

799
01:07:31,706 --> 01:07:33,226
At my apartment.

800
01:07:33,251 --> 01:07:36,396
Oh
Yeah.

801
01:07:39,065 --> 01:07:41,174
Can we sit down for a second?

802
01:07:42,328 --> 01:07:45,112
Yeah.
Okay.

803
01:07:53,144 --> 01:07:54,643
Just...

804
01:07:57,183 --> 01:07:58,926
have a sit.

805
01:08:13,787 --> 01:08:16,183
How do you...?

806
01:08:17,052 --> 01:08:20,597
You know...
How to...?

807
01:08:21,453 --> 01:08:25,781
My father was an officer, in the Army.
Psychological operations.

808
01:08:25,814 --> 01:08:29,566
He was concerned I might be
taken advantage of somehow,

809
01:08:29,591 --> 01:08:35,946
so he arranged for me to train
under a specialist, during my childhood.

810
01:08:35,971 --> 01:08:39,193
We live in 34 homes in 17 years.

811
01:08:39,627 --> 01:08:42,377
- You moved 34 times?
- Mm.

812
01:08:43,052 --> 01:08:45,644
God, that's extraordinary.

813
01:08:47,582 --> 01:08:49,964
Now I'm sure it must
have been difficult.

814
01:08:50,484 --> 01:08:52,676
I've never been anywhere.

815
01:08:54,130 --> 01:08:58,084
Only Cancun,
not my proudest moment.

816
01:08:58,370 --> 01:08:59,852
Um.

817
01:09:00,795 --> 01:09:02,655
I just mean...

818
01:09:04,751 --> 01:09:07,286
Your life is... unique.

819
01:09:07,311 --> 01:09:09,167
It's not unique, I have...

820
01:09:09,192 --> 01:09:12,136
 I have functioning form of autism
Which...

821
01:09:12,446 --> 01:09:14,338
means I have an
extremely narrow focus,

822
01:09:14,363 --> 01:09:17,446
and a hard time abandoning tasks
once I've taken them up.

823
01:09:17,471 --> 01:09:22,141
I have difficulties socializing
with other people I don't know,

824
01:09:22,982 --> 01:09:24,921
but I want to.

825
01:09:30,777 --> 01:09:33,081
When I was a senior 
in high school.

826
01:09:33,106 --> 01:09:35,712
I wanted this 
special dress for prom.

827
01:09:35,737 --> 01:09:37,987
I told myself that spending
a hundred bucks on a trashy dress

828
01:09:38,012 --> 01:09:39,494
that I was going to wear
one time to an event

829
01:09:39,519 --> 01:09:40,901
that I thought was silly
in the first place,

830
01:09:40,926 --> 01:09:42,247
- it's just...
- Wasteful.

831
01:09:42,272 --> 01:09:43,690
Yes.

832
01:09:43,715 --> 01:09:48,311
But Vera Wang made this 
black strapless classic,

833
01:09:48,336 --> 01:09:50,965
 it was more expensive but you could
wear it to all kinds of future events.

834
01:09:50,990 --> 01:09:52,941
- It's an investment.
- Yes!

835
01:09:52,966 --> 01:09:55,040
Where were you when
I was in high school?

836
01:09:55,065 --> 01:09:57,626
Oh, North Carolina.
Israel.

837
01:09:59,025 --> 01:10:01,154
Right.
Um.

838
01:10:01,178 --> 01:10:03,367
The problem is. They wanted
$1700 dollars for this dress,

839
01:10:03,393 --> 01:10:04,608
and I didn't have that so...

840
01:10:04,633 --> 01:10:06,793
- You asked your parents?
- No.

841
01:10:07,079 --> 01:10:08,625
Hang on.

842
01:10:10,049 --> 01:10:12,984
Black Jack.
I never played a hand but I...

843
01:10:13,019 --> 01:10:15,336
went to the library and checked out
all these books on strategy.

844
01:10:15,361 --> 01:10:18,028
And I turned the Naperville North
math club into a little Vegas!

845
01:10:18,053 --> 01:10:20,669
- What's a "math club"?
- Math club.

846
01:10:21,299 --> 01:10:23,161
You compete against other schools.

847
01:10:23,196 --> 01:10:25,480
Theory and speed math.

848
01:10:25,490 --> 01:10:31,034
Like what's 298,567 times 92.

849
01:10:31,059 --> 01:10:36,671
27,468,164.

850
01:10:39,951 --> 01:10:41,991
Right.
Um.

851
01:10:42,859 --> 01:10:44,415
Black Jack.

852
01:10:44,440 --> 01:10:47,541
I could tell you when to hit,
stand, split, re-split,

853
01:10:47,566 --> 01:10:51,106
then moved on to card counting,
shuffle tracking, hole carding.

854
01:10:51,131 --> 01:10:54,946
And I took everything I had,
which is $183 dollars,

855
01:10:54,971 --> 01:10:57,940
and I drove down to
Harrahs in Joliet.

856
01:10:57,965 --> 01:11:01,681
- Why was this dress so important to you?
- It wasn't about the dress.

857
01:11:03,369 --> 01:11:08,136
I just wanted to walk into that gym
and have everybody say “Wow.”

858
01:11:09,750 --> 01:11:11,808
I was trying to...

859
01:11:11,911 --> 01:11:15,438
Hold on.
I was trying to connect.

860
01:11:18,172 --> 01:11:21,787
I think no matter how different,
we're all trying to do the same thing.

861
01:11:24,991 --> 01:11:30,464
But I... I lost all but 20 bucks
in the first 10 minutes.

862
01:11:31,267 --> 01:11:35,981
Fed that into a nickel slot
on the way out and I won 2 grand.

863
01:11:36,175 --> 01:11:38,834
I used the extra cash
to pay for a limo.

864
01:11:40,560 --> 01:11:43,190
Only wore the dress
just the one time.

865
01:11:55,081 --> 01:11:57,197
Chris, why are we here?

866
01:11:58,438 --> 01:12:00,172
Um...

867
01:12:00,865 --> 01:12:03,707
I thought this hotel
had good water pressure.

868
01:12:03,732 --> 01:12:06,846
The Holiday Inn Express in Aurora
has good water pressure.

869
01:12:06,871 --> 01:12:10,208
Yes, but these towels are very fancy.

870
01:12:10,985 --> 01:12:13,890
Cheaper hotels have scratchy towels.

871
01:12:15,152 --> 01:12:16,619
And...

872
01:12:17,634 --> 01:12:19,634
I wanted you to like it.

873
01:12:36,596 --> 01:12:39,292
Crazy Eddie and the Panama Pump.

874
01:12:39,691 --> 01:12:42,626
Crazy Eddie Antar and the Panama Pump.
Have you ever heard of it?

875
01:12:42,651 --> 01:12:43,958
What?

876
01:12:43,983 --> 01:12:46,185
Crazy Eddie Antar!
He owned a...

877
01:12:46,210 --> 01:12:49,387
a string of electronics stores
on New York City in the '80s.

878
01:12:49,412 --> 01:12:52,991
Crazy Eddie Antar, he started stealing
almost as soon as he opened his business.

879
01:12:53,016 --> 01:12:54,229
Okay, I'm not following.

880
01:12:54,254 --> 01:12:56,579
He deposited money in Tel Aviv,
then he cycled them

881
01:12:56,604 --> 01:12:58,733
through Panama and
bring back into his stores.

882
01:12:58,758 --> 01:13:00,869
Okay, why? Why take
it out and put it back?

883
01:13:00,894 --> 01:13:04,016
Well, initially he was just stealing and
garden-variety taxes evasion.

884
01:13:04,041 --> 01:13:06,463
But he came up
with a better idea.

885
01:13:06,488 --> 01:13:08,488
You see,
by taking his own money,

886
01:13:08,513 --> 01:13:11,261
stealing it and putting it
back on his books.

887
01:13:11,286 --> 01:13:12,694
It was raining cash.

888
01:13:12,731 --> 01:13:14,904
He took the company public at
eight dollars a share.

889
01:13:14,929 --> 01:13:18,111
A year later it was
trading at seventy-five.

890
01:13:19,100 --> 01:13:21,702
Rita's taking Living Robotics public.

891
01:13:21,727 --> 01:13:22,659
Yes.

892
01:13:22,684 --> 01:13:26,695
But why would she hire you in the first
place if she thought you'd figure it out?

893
01:13:27,884 --> 01:13:29,436
I don't know.

894
01:13:30,631 --> 01:13:32,598
I'll have to ask her.

895
01:13:35,033 --> 01:13:38,856
Whatever Rita's involve in,
it's not your concern.

896
01:13:39,202 --> 01:13:41,428
You disappear,
I make a call.

897
01:13:41,453 --> 01:13:43,571
Please.
I'm worried about you.

898
01:13:43,596 --> 01:13:46,021
If I don't do something,
Dana will die.

899
01:13:46,046 --> 01:13:48,743
Risking your life for a girl
you known a week.

900
01:13:48,768 --> 01:13:50,352
Why?

901
01:13:52,125 --> 01:13:55,144
Heavy sigh.
What's the plan?

902
01:13:55,169 --> 01:13:57,665
Find the person who
wants to kill her.

903
01:13:57,690 --> 01:13:59,148
And?

904
01:13:59,469 --> 01:14:01,262
Shoot him in the head.

905
01:16:14,819 --> 01:16:16,430
Last one.

906
01:16:16,974 --> 01:16:20,154
Two APS.
Christian.

907
01:16:21,467 --> 01:16:24,110
245 men.

908
01:16:25,268 --> 01:16:28,090
Four with incomes over a million.

909
01:16:29,748 --> 01:16:32,551
All over the age of sixty.
Sorry.

910
01:16:32,576 --> 01:16:36,096
But...
your guy's an accountant.

911
01:16:36,803 --> 01:16:39,863
Two Christian Wolffs own CPA first .

912
01:16:40,106 --> 01:16:45,338
The first Christian Wolff,
owns Wolff Accounting,

913
01:16:45,363 --> 01:16:49,071
121 South Street,
Scottsdale, Arizona.

914
01:16:49,096 --> 01:16:53,727
Income of 435 grand.
It's a good year.

915
01:16:53,753 --> 01:16:56,927
So good, we audited
him 2 years ago.

916
01:16:56,952 --> 01:16:58,207
He's clean.

917
01:16:58,232 --> 01:17:01,318
The other Christian Wolff.

918
01:17:02,553 --> 01:17:03,676
Nope.

919
01:17:03,701 --> 01:17:05,696
Only 75 grand.

920
01:17:07,239 --> 01:17:10,400
ZZZ Accounting.

921
01:17:10,803 --> 01:17:14,705
Wabash Way, Plainfield, Illinois.

922
01:17:14,707 --> 01:17:19,565
ZZZ, it's not exactly
a smart Yellow pages move.

923
01:17:23,483 --> 01:17:25,206
Wait a second.

924
01:17:26,919 --> 01:17:31,438
Who filed the returns for Kim's nails, 
Wabash Way, Plainfield

925
01:17:34,168 --> 01:17:35,926
ZZZ Accounting.

926
01:17:35,928 --> 01:17:39,533
- Could just be the neighbor...
- Great Mandarin, Wabash.

927
01:17:42,409 --> 01:17:43,880
ZZZ Accounting.

928
01:17:43,905 --> 01:17:45,651
Paul's Laundromat.

929
01:17:48,968 --> 01:17:51,208
- ZZZ Accounting.
- ZZZ Accounting.

930
01:17:51,863 --> 01:17:54,859
Tell me they are all
registered as partnerships.

931
01:17:56,522 --> 01:17:58,061
Everyone.

932
01:17:58,086 --> 01:18:01,691
Managing partner: Christian Wolff.

933
01:18:10,338 --> 01:18:12,171
- Christian Wolff.
- What?

934
01:18:12,198 --> 01:18:16,014
Christian Wolff, last year ran
$75,543 through his accounting firm...

935
01:18:16,039 --> 01:18:18,350
Whoa.
Who is Christian Wolff?

936
01:18:18,375 --> 01:18:20,102
The accountant.

937
01:18:21,207 --> 01:18:22,351
Well...

938
01:18:22,376 --> 01:18:25,082
- 75 grand, that's chump change.
- Agreed, but...

939
01:18:25,107 --> 01:18:30,464
He ran another $287,765
through Kim's Nails,

940
01:18:30,489 --> 01:18:35,338
$445,112 trough Great Mandarin Chinese,
and you'll love this...

941
01:18:35,363 --> 01:18:40,495
$505,909 through Paul's Laundromat.

942
01:18:40,520 --> 01:18:43,680
Paul's Laundromat?!
Are you fucking kidding me?

943
01:18:43,705 --> 01:18:44,746
He's playing with us.

944
01:18:44,771 --> 01:18:47,252
He can't clean that kind of money
through an accounting firm.

945
01:18:47,277 --> 01:18:48,854
The paper trail's too heavy.

946
01:18:48,879 --> 01:18:50,721
So he's laundering it
through cash businesses.

947
01:18:50,746 --> 01:18:53,696
All of those companies are in the
same strip mall south of Chicago.

948
01:18:53,721 --> 01:18:54,806
ZZZ?

949
01:18:54,831 --> 01:18:57,470
And he doesn't care about the traffic,
it's a front,

950
01:18:57,495 --> 01:19:01,823
All of it. “Christian Wolff,”
"Carl Gauss", “Lou ‘Lewis' Carroll.”

951
01:19:01,848 --> 01:19:05,628
He's using the names of famous
mathematicians as a cover.

952
01:19:07,920 --> 01:19:12,922
Charitable Contributions here to
Harbor Neuroscience last year alone,

953
01:19:12,947 --> 01:19:15,710
- that's got to come to close to...
-  One million one hundred dollars.

954
01:19:15,735 --> 01:19:19,027
That one's not a cover.
That's the real deal, I've checked.

955
01:19:19,338 --> 01:19:22,489
So you're telling me this guy risks
his life doing forensic accounting

956
01:19:22,514 --> 01:19:25,279
for some of the scariest people
on the planet,

957
01:19:25,304 --> 01:19:27,776
collect his fee, goes to
all the trouble laundering it

958
01:19:27,801 --> 01:19:30,508
and then gives
almost all of it away.

959
01:19:31,516 --> 01:19:34,176
What if he's taking
other means of payment?

960
01:19:36,644 --> 01:19:38,716
Yeah.
Possible, yeah.

961
01:19:40,133 --> 01:19:41,988
I got him, Ray.

962
01:19:42,276 --> 01:19:43,747
Maybe.

963
01:19:43,772 --> 01:19:46,254
Pack your bag.
We're going to Chicago.

964
01:20:58,725 --> 01:21:01,915
90% probability they are
all right-handed.

965
01:21:01,940 --> 01:21:04,382
It was an accident.

966
01:21:04,633 --> 01:21:07,115
To me it's stand forth, right wrist.

967
01:21:07,140 --> 01:21:10,906
But maybe you enjoy waiting
in the schoolyard sucker punch.

968
01:21:12,790 --> 01:21:16,627
Life is a series of choices,
none of which are new.

969
01:21:17,893 --> 01:21:21,579
The oldest is choosing
to be a victim

970
01:21:21,604 --> 01:21:23,944
or choose not to.

971
01:21:25,160 --> 01:21:27,935
Second on the list, loyalty.

972
01:21:27,960 --> 01:21:31,710
Family first, good times or bad.

973
01:21:37,390 --> 01:21:39,693
Bonjour, fellows.

974
01:21:39,718 --> 01:21:42,749
- Yeah!
- Let's see what he's got, yeah.

975
01:21:42,774 --> 01:21:45,046
They are new glasses.

976
01:21:46,802 --> 01:21:51,838
You think if... you don't fight back,
then maybe they'll like you?

977
01:21:52,474 --> 01:21:55,668
Stop picking on you,
calling you freak?

978
01:21:55,955 --> 01:21:57,617
Here's what it is.

979
01:21:57,642 --> 01:22:01,369
They don't like you,
they don't dislike you.

980
01:22:01,394 --> 01:22:04,845
They are afraid of you.
You're different.

981
01:22:05,781 --> 01:22:08,587
Sooner or later
different scares people.

982
01:22:12,972 --> 01:22:16,751
Victim or not?
Make your decision.

983
01:22:50,801 --> 01:22:52,253
Go.

984
01:23:06,465 --> 01:23:08,169
You're different.

985
01:23:12,401 --> 01:23:15,474
Sooner or later
different scares people.

986
01:24:20,457 --> 01:24:22,048
In here.

987
01:24:32,978 --> 01:24:35,675
.357 Colt Python.

988
01:24:35,873 --> 01:24:37,910
Serial number's gone.

989
01:24:39,046 --> 01:24:40,628
Hydra-Shok

990
01:24:52,364 --> 01:24:54,678
Wireless security cam.

991
01:24:55,159 --> 01:24:57,902
Infrared, weatherproof.

992
01:24:57,927 --> 01:24:59,758
He's got a network of them.

993
01:24:59,792 --> 01:25:02,489
The whole backyard he's got eyes.

994
01:25:08,964 --> 01:25:10,385
This is our guy.

995
01:25:10,410 --> 01:25:13,700
So why is a guy who's up to
his elbows in cash live here?

996
01:25:13,725 --> 01:25:18,336
Given his clientele, he figures
blending in will extend his shelf life.

997
01:25:18,731 --> 01:25:20,708
It's the smart move.

998
01:25:21,927 --> 01:25:24,207
Well, maybe not smart enough.

999
01:25:24,940 --> 01:25:27,785
I take security cameras back here.

1000
01:25:28,776 --> 01:25:31,168
Anybody can roll up
from the front.

1001
01:25:31,368 --> 01:25:33,470
How does he cover this?

1002
01:25:37,229 --> 01:25:39,849
Jesus, Mary and Joseph!

1003
01:25:47,086 --> 01:25:49,092
Don't see that everyday.

1004
01:25:50,956 --> 01:25:54,286
Boys, let's have a situation report.

1005
01:25:54,718 --> 01:25:56,116
Are we good, Ike?

1006
01:25:56,141 --> 01:25:57,718
All clear.

1007
01:25:57,743 --> 01:25:59,274
Rock and roll.

1008
01:25:59,299 --> 01:26:01,339
And how about you, sport?

1009
01:26:01,364 --> 01:26:03,123
It's Bobby.

1010
01:26:03,819 --> 01:26:05,618
I got nothing.

1011
01:26:15,256 --> 01:26:17,224
Is all this really necessary?

1012
01:26:17,249 --> 01:26:18,986
You should be
watching his home.

1013
01:26:19,011 --> 01:26:22,316
Yeah. That what you think?
That your idea of a subject.

1014
01:26:22,341 --> 01:26:25,121
I love it when people tell me
how to do my job.

1015
01:26:25,157 --> 01:26:27,300
I believe I recommended you
to leave the country.

1016
01:26:27,325 --> 01:26:29,833
- You declined.
- He's an accountant!

1017
01:26:30,350 --> 01:26:31,690
I could see it in his eyes.

1018
01:26:31,715 --> 01:26:34,130
The freak wasn't
going to let it go.

1019
01:26:37,760 --> 01:26:40,588
- Give my best to Michelle.
- I will.

1020
01:26:57,167 --> 01:26:59,911
I was old 10 years ago.

1021
01:27:02,913 --> 01:27:05,475
So what's your story, Medina?

1022
01:27:06,310 --> 01:27:07,944
You know my story.

1023
01:27:07,969 --> 01:27:10,113
I know what the Court said.

1024
01:27:12,997 --> 01:27:16,798
I stuffed a handful of cocaine
up a drug dealer's nose.

1025
01:27:16,823 --> 01:27:19,881
Pistol-whipped him
in the trunk of his car.

1026
01:27:20,643 --> 01:27:24,292
I was seventeen.
It was August.

1027
01:27:24,317 --> 01:27:27,985
He coked for three days,
but lived.

1028
01:27:28,320 --> 01:27:29,849
Do you regret it?

1029
01:27:29,874 --> 01:27:32,744
The coke was half borax.

1030
01:27:32,769 --> 01:27:35,564
Same shit he kept
selling me sister.

1031
01:27:36,159 --> 01:27:39,172
She's a dental hygienist
in Annapolis now.

1032
01:27:39,197 --> 01:27:41,535
Married with 3 kids.

1033
01:27:45,109 --> 01:27:47,216
No, I don't regret it.

1034
01:27:47,840 --> 01:27:49,520
That's rough.

1035
01:27:50,662 --> 01:27:52,976
All due respect, Director King,

1036
01:27:53,001 --> 01:27:55,958
what the fuck do you
know about Wolff?

1037
01:28:00,047 --> 01:28:03,174
- Wait, let me call it in!
- Move back!

1038
01:28:03,199 --> 01:28:05,486
What don't you tell me, Medina?

1039
01:28:09,165 --> 01:28:10,554
Halt!

1040
01:28:10,579 --> 01:28:13,810
Men kill each other
for any number of reasons.

1041
01:28:14,851 --> 01:28:19,042
Money, power,
fear.

1042
01:28:19,067 --> 01:28:20,921
Take that, motherfucker!

1043
01:28:23,926 --> 01:28:26,897
9 men had died
that day at the Ravenite.

1044
01:28:27,958 --> 01:28:30,010
But for none of those reasons.

1045
01:28:32,518 --> 01:28:36,384
They had taken something from
the man who was killing them.

1046
01:28:37,556 --> 01:28:40,344
Something that couldn't be
made whole again.

1047
01:28:41,736 --> 01:28:44,411
Something very important to him.

1048
01:28:45,768 --> 01:28:48,022
And he was there
for his pound of flesh.

1049
01:28:48,047 --> 01:28:49,203
Please.

1050
01:28:49,602 --> 01:28:51,348
Please, stop!

1051
01:28:51,373 --> 01:28:53,234
Who did that to him?

1052
01:28:54,500 --> 01:28:56,640
"Little Tony" Bazzano.

1053
01:28:57,509 --> 01:28:59,944
I'd been wasting
in a van for 6 months

1054
01:28:59,969 --> 01:29:03,918
listening to that arrogant little prick
belch, fart, and brag.

1055
01:29:06,161 --> 01:29:09,253
I didn't recognize his voice
with all the fear in it.

1056
01:29:09,278 --> 01:29:12,222
I didn't touch him.
I didn't touch that old man.

1057
01:29:12,247 --> 01:29:13,542
I wasn't even...

1058
01:29:18,469 --> 01:29:21,172
Our man had come for revenge

1059
01:29:21,364 --> 01:29:23,111
and he got it.

1060
01:29:23,900 --> 01:29:25,820
Nine dead.

1061
01:29:28,054 --> 01:29:29,973
And I was tenth.

1062
01:29:31,889 --> 01:29:33,529
Your name?

1063
01:29:35,781 --> 01:29:37,111
Ray.

1064
01:29:38,290 --> 01:29:40,001
Raymond King.

1065
01:29:40,026 --> 01:29:42,904
Who employs you, Raymond King?

1066
01:29:44,084 --> 01:29:46,080
I'm a Treasury Agent.

1067
01:29:47,434 --> 01:29:49,182
Are you a good one?

1068
01:29:51,509 --> 01:29:54,778
No.
No. Not particularly.

1069
01:29:56,575 --> 01:29:57,980
Is that it?

1070
01:29:59,349 --> 01:30:02,005
Kids. I got...
I'm a dad.

1071
01:30:02,030 --> 01:30:03,825
I got 2 kids.

1072
01:30:05,079 --> 01:30:06,548
Grown?

1073
01:30:08,867 --> 01:30:10,239
Yeah.

1074
01:30:10,729 --> 01:30:13,951
Yes. Yes.
They're all... They're all grown up.

1075
01:30:15,368 --> 01:30:18,381
Were you a good dad?
Ray King?

1076
01:30:21,608 --> 01:30:24,563
Yeah.
I've been a good dad.

1077
01:30:27,212 --> 01:30:31,232
I'm a lousy agent
and I've been a weak man,

1078
01:30:32,381 --> 01:30:34,906
but that...
that I didn't screw up.

1079
01:30:36,002 --> 01:30:37,885
That I got right.

1080
01:30:51,752 --> 01:30:54,677
Imagine you were a Treasury agent
approaching the twilight of a

1081
01:30:54,702 --> 01:30:57,682
spectacularly dismal career...

1082
01:30:59,027 --> 01:31:00,795
And then one day...

1083
01:31:00,820 --> 01:31:03,636
that break you should've been
looking for...

1084
01:31:03,661 --> 01:31:06,887
Francis Silveberg, the black money legend,

1085
01:31:06,912 --> 01:31:11,330
who cleaned cash from
Monte Carlo to Havana to Vegas.

1086
01:31:11,658 --> 01:31:15,922
He kept the books for the
Gambino family for forty plus years.

1087
01:31:15,947 --> 01:31:18,401
Until one day, the boss,
"Big Tony" Bazzano,

1088
01:31:18,426 --> 01:31:22,160
thought maybe the old man's age
made him vulnerable to prosecution.

1089
01:31:22,185 --> 01:31:25,475
Ordered his son, "Little Tony",
to kill Francis.

1090
01:31:25,803 --> 01:31:27,322
Kid fucked it up.

1091
01:31:27,347 --> 01:31:32,372
Francis ran, became a was a federal informant
in return for protective custody.

1092
01:31:32,397 --> 01:31:35,000
It could've turned my career around

1093
01:31:35,025 --> 01:31:37,002
only If I had listened.

1094
01:31:38,559 --> 01:31:40,026
I didn't.

1095
01:31:40,405 --> 01:31:42,369
He was processed out.

1096
01:31:42,394 --> 01:31:45,031
And he lost the only
protection he had.

1097
01:31:45,768 --> 01:31:51,312
The protection that he was promised
when he testified against "Big Tony".

1098
01:31:53,884 --> 01:31:57,109
And this time,
"Little Tony" got it right.

1099
01:31:57,601 --> 01:32:00,240
He had Francis
in a couple of hours.

1100
01:32:00,992 --> 01:32:05,134
in a filthy basement in the Bronx,
nailed to a chair,

1101
01:32:06,480 --> 01:32:08,579
tortured to death.

1102
01:32:11,492 --> 01:32:16,273
So I...
volunteered for a joint task force,

1103
01:32:16,508 --> 01:32:19,576
Sat outside the Ravenite
surveillance van for months

1104
01:32:19,601 --> 01:32:24,084
hoping to get a shred of evidence
to use against Francis's killers.

1105
01:32:26,501 --> 01:32:29,735
Wait, wait,
let me call it in!

1106
01:32:31,214 --> 01:32:31,935
Move back!

1107
01:32:31,973 --> 01:32:34,811
I went in there hoping
I could ease my guilt.

1108
01:32:36,836 --> 01:32:39,033
And I met our accountant.

1109
01:32:40,351 --> 01:32:43,395
Why he let me live,
I didn't know .

1110
01:32:44,478 --> 01:32:46,527
But he changed my life.

1111
01:32:49,563 --> 01:32:52,133
I gave my notice
to the department.

1112
01:32:52,557 --> 01:32:55,334
I started looking forward
to the day again.

1113
01:32:55,359 --> 01:32:58,243
Get up,
feel the sun on my face.

1114
01:32:58,695 --> 01:33:00,256
Quit drinking.

1115
01:33:00,786 --> 01:33:02,927
Was on my way out the door...

1116
01:33:04,155 --> 01:33:06,205
and then the phone rang.

1117
01:33:06,370 --> 01:33:07,493
Ray King.

1118
01:33:07,518 --> 01:33:09,057
I'll never forget that voice.

1119
01:33:09,060 --> 01:33:11,933
Do you like puzzles, Raymond King?

1120
01:33:13,741 --> 01:33:16,701
She tells me she works
for the accountant.

1121
01:33:16,968 --> 01:33:20,395
And that a shipping container
packed with Chinese nationals

1122
01:33:20,420 --> 01:33:23,370
is passing through
the Port of New York.

1123
01:33:23,742 --> 01:33:25,516
A few months later,

1124
01:33:25,541 --> 01:33:30,589
one ton of uncut Juarez Cartel product
is entering Miami.

1125
01:33:31,578 --> 01:33:34,441
All those cases you put together.

1126
01:33:35,687 --> 01:33:37,579
Smoke and mirrors.

1127
01:33:41,126 --> 01:33:44,041
So, who is he...

1128
01:33:44,066 --> 01:33:45,171
this “accountant”?

1129
01:33:45,196 --> 01:33:49,043
Prisoner 831,
Fort Leavenworth maximum security.

1130
01:33:49,068 --> 01:33:51,070
Military prison?

1131
01:33:51,369 --> 01:33:53,291
So he was in the army.

1132
01:33:53,943 --> 01:33:57,725
Army lent him to us to track
Al-Qaeda money launderers

1133
01:33:58,143 --> 01:34:02,469
He was transferred from Leavenworth
to our detention center in DC.

1134
01:34:03,267 --> 01:34:05,631
Did the work of five men.

1135
01:34:05,734 --> 01:34:09,313
Data Mining, Basket Analysis.

1136
01:34:10,496 --> 01:34:12,601
He roomed with Francis.

1137
01:34:12,626 --> 01:34:16,759
They kept to themselves.
Played chess. Ate together.

1138
01:34:16,784 --> 01:34:19,309
Sat in a TV room together.

1139
01:34:20,203 --> 01:34:22,231
They were inseparable.

1140
01:34:23,327 --> 01:34:25,641
And then one day, a guard
told Wolff why Francis

1141
01:34:25,666 --> 01:34:28,862
hadn't called or written
since he got out.

1142
01:34:29,293 --> 01:34:33,641
His burned body had been found
on a Staten Island landfill.

1143
01:34:34,794 --> 01:34:38,291
Wolff snapped,
went after the guard.

1144
01:34:38,541 --> 01:34:41,998
He fractured the man's skull
with a thermos.

1145
01:34:42,286 --> 01:34:44,939
Escaped from a
third-floor window.

1146
01:34:45,675 --> 01:34:47,464
Took the thermos.

1147
01:34:47,702 --> 01:34:49,131
That's all you got?

1148
01:34:49,156 --> 01:34:52,302
- I mean, Leavenworth, they would have military...
- Records are all heavily redacted.

1149
01:34:52,327 --> 01:34:54,939
Well then, arrest records or something.

1150
01:34:55,285 --> 01:34:59,850
Spring of 2003, at a funeral home
in Kankakee, Illinois.

1151
01:35:00,687 --> 01:35:05,440
Our boy sent 6 locals to the hospital
with a variety of injuries.

1152
01:35:06,646 --> 01:35:08,671
No one knew Wolff.

1153
01:35:08,713 --> 01:35:13,854
The older man who came with him
was identified as a colonel, US Army.

1154
01:35:15,197 --> 01:35:16,971
Funeral home.

1155
01:35:17,252 --> 01:35:18,760
Whose wake?

1156
01:35:18,785 --> 01:35:21,031
One customer that day.

1157
01:35:24,195 --> 01:35:26,448
Mrs. Lauren Alton.

1158
01:35:28,527 --> 01:35:32,576
Mrs. Alton taught first grade
for 13 years in Kankakee.

1159
01:35:32,671 --> 01:35:36,438
Survived by a husband
and two boys, ages 12 and 10.

1160
01:35:37,595 --> 01:35:41,219
By all accounts,
an ordinary life, well-lived

1161
01:35:41,322 --> 01:35:43,153
but cut short.

1162
01:35:47,328 --> 01:35:51,221
Excuse me, sir.
This is family only.

1163
01:35:51,451 --> 01:35:55,089
Sir, please come over.
I'll have to ask you to step outside.

1164
01:35:55,114 --> 01:35:59,556
And then a fight breaks out.
A brawl really.

1165
01:35:59,827 --> 01:36:03,395
Over what, the authorities never...
get down.

1166
01:36:03,420 --> 01:36:05,446
Get your hands off me.

1167
01:36:08,411 --> 01:36:10,444
Deputies respond.

1168
01:36:10,792 --> 01:36:15,889
A barney fife type squares off
with our boy gets rattled, pulls his gun.

1169
01:36:16,117 --> 01:36:19,818
The colonel just stepped in front
of the 83 weapon.

1170
01:36:21,452 --> 01:36:23,807
Army collected both men.

1171
01:36:23,955 --> 01:36:27,411
Police report named
Wolff as "Soldier one".

1172
01:36:27,436 --> 01:36:30,810
The widower identified the colonel by name.

1173
01:36:30,835 --> 01:36:33,589
His late wife's former husband.

1174
01:36:33,749 --> 01:36:36,042
I've checked, it's an alias.

1175
01:36:36,182 --> 01:36:39,268
No more real than "Christian Wolff."

1176
01:36:42,161 --> 01:36:45,102
She was the dead colonel's ex-wife.

1177
01:36:47,575 --> 01:36:50,073
And you think
Wolff is what to him?

1178
01:36:56,695 --> 01:37:00,302
Were you a good dad?
Ray King?

1179
01:37:09,534 --> 01:37:12,459
I've given up trying to figure out
when I'll get a call.

1180
01:37:12,484 --> 01:37:15,375
The why though,
that I got.

1181
01:37:16,345 --> 01:37:19,347
Someone breaks his moral code.

1182
01:37:29,688 --> 01:37:31,931
Why are you telling me this?

1183
01:37:31,956 --> 01:37:34,497
I'm retiring in a few months.

1184
01:37:35,801 --> 01:37:37,903
When she calls...

1185
01:37:39,194 --> 01:37:41,747
someone needs to be
there to answer.

1186
01:37:56,495 --> 01:37:57,820
No.

1187
01:38:01,085 --> 01:38:02,861
He's a criminal, Ray.

1188
01:38:02,886 --> 01:38:04,112
Yeah.

1189
01:38:04,137 --> 01:38:08,359
He aids and abets drug cartels,
money launderers.

1190
01:38:08,415 --> 01:38:10,439
He's a fucking killer.

1191
01:38:11,551 --> 01:38:14,357
Believe me, I've wrestled
with the same decision.

1192
01:38:15,800 --> 01:38:18,497
But when I got
that first call,

1193
01:38:19,339 --> 01:38:21,766
I realized something.

1194
01:38:24,382 --> 01:38:30,215
I spent my whole life only recognizing
my lucky breaks after they were gone.

1195
01:38:37,264 --> 01:38:39,257
The Brit, who is she?

1196
01:38:52,677 --> 01:38:53,915
Hello?

1197
01:38:53,940 --> 01:38:55,678
Miss. Medina,

1198
01:38:56,747 --> 01:38:59,570
tell Eliot Ness to get
his feet off the furniture.

1199
01:38:59,595 --> 01:39:01,812
He's not in a barn.

1200
01:39:03,414 --> 01:39:07,461
Living Robotics.
Write it down.

1201
01:39:11,373 --> 01:39:13,961
More than 6 feet, short hair,
athletic build, yes?

1202
01:39:13,986 --> 01:39:15,003
Correct.

1203
01:39:15,028 --> 01:39:17,251
When you say short hair,
you mean short hair like my hair?

1204
01:39:17,276 --> 01:39:19,654
- Or you mean short hair like short hair?
- You... What's the difference?

1205
01:39:19,679 --> 01:39:21,413
I was told you could fix this,
so fix it!

1206
01:39:21,438 --> 01:39:24,013
But you did speak to the man, am I right?
You spoke to him.

1207
01:39:24,038 --> 01:39:25,244
What did he sound like?

1208
01:39:25,269 --> 01:39:28,880
We made small talk,
what's it matter what he sounds like?

1209
01:39:30,374 --> 01:39:32,930
That's Ike, right?
Is it north side?

1210
01:39:32,955 --> 01:39:34,937
Yo Bobby, was that you?

1211
01:39:37,458 --> 01:39:38,866
Bob.

1212
01:39:42,760 --> 01:39:44,239
Bobby.

1213
01:39:45,602 --> 01:39:47,576
Ike, are you there?

1214
01:39:48,359 --> 01:39:49,774
Ike.

1215
01:39:51,101 --> 01:39:53,813
Guys, stop fucking around, someone answer me.
Ike.

1216
01:39:53,838 --> 01:39:55,553
Course to the left.

1217
01:39:55,578 --> 01:39:59,463
You might consider using a round
with superior ballistic coefficient.

1218
01:40:02,106 --> 01:40:03,939
Give me the layout
of the home.

1219
01:40:03,964 --> 01:40:07,539
Points of entry,
corridors, rooms, cover.

1220
01:40:07,564 --> 01:40:08,945
Go.

1221
01:40:10,462 --> 01:40:11,899
Fuck!

1222
01:40:13,853 --> 01:40:14,871
Sit down.

1223
01:40:14,896 --> 01:40:17,589
- What's this all...?
- Shut up and sit down in the chair.

1224
01:40:44,082 --> 01:40:47,141
You ever see a magic green round
traveling 3000 feet per second

1225
01:40:47,166 --> 01:40:49,229
go through a window?

1226
01:40:51,264 --> 01:40:52,702
Nobody does.

1227
01:40:52,727 --> 01:40:54,439
Get down now!

1228
01:41:31,095 --> 01:41:33,367
4 men, front entrance.

1229
01:41:33,675 --> 01:41:35,666
Go right at him, go now.

1230
01:41:41,405 --> 01:41:42,814
You,

1231
01:41:42,839 --> 01:41:46,315
I got the cameras.
Go join your friends.

1232
01:41:50,739 --> 01:41:52,086
Up!

1233
01:41:55,181 --> 01:41:56,585
Clear.

1234
01:42:09,167 --> 01:42:10,725
Smoke.

1235
01:42:35,499 --> 01:42:36,941
Move!
Move!

1236
01:42:37,538 --> 01:42:38,857
Move!

1237
01:42:46,606 --> 01:42:47,868
Go!

1238
01:42:50,407 --> 01:42:52,183
Man down!

1239
01:42:54,294 --> 01:42:56,231
I'm at the front entrance,

1240
01:42:56,256 --> 01:42:58,027
pinned down!

1241
01:43:31,048 --> 01:43:32,839
Are they dead?

1242
01:43:37,287 --> 01:43:40,065
I need situation info.
How many down?

1243
01:43:40,479 --> 01:43:42,544
Are they dead?
Answer me!

1244
01:43:44,678 --> 01:43:47,237
Okay, he's on the roof.
Now, follow me, let's move.

1245
01:43:47,278 --> 01:43:49,102
Check the skylight.
Check the window.

1246
01:43:49,127 --> 01:43:51,158
When that motherfucker comes in,
I want to hear gun shots,

1247
01:43:51,183 --> 01:43:53,405
and I want to hear
"Target eliminated".

1248
01:44:03,044 --> 01:44:04,023
Shit.

1249
01:44:04,568 --> 01:44:06,458
He's in the god damn house!

1250
01:44:06,483 --> 01:44:07,704
Get out there and end this!

1251
01:44:07,729 --> 01:44:11,077
Brax, give me a situation report.
Have you got eyes on anything?

1252
01:46:19,483 --> 01:46:20,899
What's happening?

1253
01:46:21,839 --> 01:46:23,382
Say something!

1254
01:46:39,700 --> 01:46:43,505
Solomon Grundy,
Born on a Monday,

1255
01:46:43,530 --> 01:46:45,484
Christened on Tuesday,

1256
01:46:46,013 --> 01:46:47,949
Married on Wednesday,

1257
01:46:48,120 --> 01:46:50,489
Took ill on Thursday,

1258
01:46:50,514 --> 01:46:52,389
Grew worse on Friday,

1259
01:46:53,519 --> 01:46:55,318
Died on Saturday,

1260
01:46:56,278 --> 01:46:58,039
Buried on Sunday,

1261
01:46:58,588 --> 01:47:02,342
That was the end,
Of Solomon Grundy.

1262
01:47:06,115 --> 01:47:08,056
WHAT IS THIS?

1263
01:47:29,263 --> 01:47:31,554
Hey! Hey!
Stand down!

1264
01:47:31,579 --> 01:47:33,085
Fuck off!

1265
01:48:13,345 --> 01:48:15,427
Hello, Braxton.

1266
01:48:19,770 --> 01:48:21,220
Don't...

1267
01:48:21,807 --> 01:48:23,697
Don't do that.

1268
01:48:27,061 --> 01:48:29,090
I've been looking for you for 10 years,
and you got to come to me like

1269
01:48:29,115 --> 01:48:32,256
we just saw each other yesterday.
That's what you got to do?

1270
01:48:32,281 --> 01:48:36,183
But...this.
What I take...

1271
01:48:36,301 --> 01:48:39,949
What I take that you're going to be
happy to see me, I guess.

1272
01:48:41,438 --> 01:48:43,032
I am happy.

1273
01:48:48,453 --> 01:48:50,375
I need to finish.

1274
01:48:52,069 --> 01:48:53,384
You should go.

1275
01:48:53,409 --> 01:48:55,105
I should go?

1276
01:48:56,106 --> 01:49:00,225
Okay, I...
Okay, I'll just go.

1277
01:49:00,811 --> 01:49:03,104
But first I'm gonna
ask you a question.

1278
01:49:03,129 --> 01:49:05,416
You're going to
give me an answer.

1279
01:49:05,934 --> 01:49:07,715
Why would you and Pop
go to that funeral?

1280
01:49:07,752 --> 01:49:11,337
She left us, did you not remember that?
Did you not remember that!

1281
01:49:19,405 --> 01:49:21,529
It's your fault that
Pop's dead, you hear me?

1282
01:49:21,554 --> 01:49:23,588
- It's your fault!
- I'm sorry, Braxton.

1283
01:49:23,613 --> 01:49:27,142
You're sorry?
Sorry doesn't cut it, you weird fuck!

1284
01:49:29,685 --> 01:49:31,011
Shit.

1285
01:49:48,946 --> 01:49:52,532
You don't give a shit about me.
You don't give a shit about me.

1286
01:49:59,069 --> 01:50:00,765
How about now?

1287
01:50:09,046 --> 01:50:11,030
Are you going to fight?

1288
01:50:13,226 --> 01:50:14,734
Fight!

1289
01:51:06,704 --> 01:51:08,582
I'm sorry, Braxton.

1290
01:51:12,356 --> 01:51:14,365
If you had to see her...

1291
01:51:15,973 --> 01:51:18,467
If that was something
that you had to do.

1292
01:51:19,466 --> 01:51:21,210
You call me.

1293
01:51:21,759 --> 01:51:23,003
I'm your brother.

1294
01:51:23,028 --> 01:51:25,059
I always have your back.

1295
01:51:25,629 --> 01:51:28,009
You don't call him,
you call me.

1296
01:51:34,609 --> 01:51:36,659
Did you even wonder
where I was?

1297
01:51:36,684 --> 01:51:38,625
I know where you were.

1298
01:51:39,361 --> 01:51:41,594
I just wanted you
to be safe.

1299
01:51:41,619 --> 01:51:43,778
Some of my clients are...

1300
01:51:44,043 --> 01:51:45,865
quite dangerous.

1301
01:51:49,010 --> 01:51:52,275
I kind of consider
fairly dangerous myself.

1302
01:51:53,760 --> 01:51:55,917
Well, you've made an improvement.

1303
01:52:04,209 --> 01:52:05,916
Shit, man.

1304
01:52:06,897 --> 01:52:08,846
You and me here,

1305
01:52:09,945 --> 01:52:12,156
- Yeah, it's...
- Well, statistically speaking...

1306
01:52:12,181 --> 01:52:14,601
Christ, man!
It's rhetorical.

1307
01:52:14,626 --> 01:52:16,293
I mean, really?

1308
01:52:17,528 --> 01:52:19,234
I was just saying.

1309
01:52:23,213 --> 01:52:25,375
Not happy.

1310
01:52:25,560 --> 01:52:29,126
Do you consider what you
do important, Mr. Wolff?

1311
01:52:29,151 --> 01:52:31,789
To someone other than yourself,
I mean.

1312
01:52:31,814 --> 01:52:34,401
What I do is.

1313
01:52:34,426 --> 01:52:38,624
Living Robotics public offering
would have been worth billions.

1314
01:52:38,649 --> 01:52:42,174
Money to be used for
neuroprosthetics, nanotechnology.

1315
01:52:42,199 --> 01:52:43,695
You?

1316
01:52:44,935 --> 01:52:47,333
Why in god's name
did I ever hire you?

1317
01:52:47,358 --> 01:52:49,534
To leak-proof your books.

1318
01:52:49,709 --> 01:52:53,704
Dana found a mistake, you wanted
to be sure it's safe to go public.

1319
01:52:54,255 --> 01:52:55,944
And now you want to kill her.

1320
01:52:55,946 --> 01:52:57,671
I'm fond of Dana.

1321
01:52:57,696 --> 01:53:00,422
But I restore lives, not Dana!
ME!

1322
01:53:00,447 --> 01:53:02,572
Men, women, children.
I give them hope.

1323
01:53:02,597 --> 01:53:04,504
Make them whole.

1324
01:53:04,529 --> 01:53:06,343
Do you even know
what that's like?

1325
01:53:06,368 --> 01:53:08,232
Yes, I do.

1326
01:53:22,039 --> 01:53:23,439
Sorry.

1327
01:53:27,079 --> 01:53:28,878
I missed you.

1328
01:53:35,653 --> 01:53:37,752
I missed you too, Braxton.

1329
01:53:40,148 --> 01:53:42,905
I missed you too
because I love you.

1330
01:53:43,097 --> 01:53:44,935
You're my brother.

1331
01:53:47,267 --> 01:53:48,832
Maybe...

1332
01:53:49,195 --> 01:53:50,752
Would you want to...

1333
01:53:51,921 --> 01:53:54,165
Maybe I can see you
in a week?

1334
01:53:54,190 --> 01:53:56,504
You name the place,
I'll be there.

1335
01:54:10,220 --> 01:54:12,117
How will I find you?

1336
01:54:13,193 --> 01:54:14,877
You won't.

1337
01:54:15,217 --> 01:54:17,091
I'll find you.

1338
01:54:22,769 --> 01:54:24,125
Helen.

1339
01:54:25,299 --> 01:54:28,244
How do you responds to rumors
that some of the victims had wounds

1340
01:54:28,271 --> 01:54:30,659
consistent with anti-aircraft rounds?

1341
01:54:30,683 --> 01:54:33,385
I'd say the Chicago police department
has ample experience

1342
01:54:33,411 --> 01:54:36,141
solving all manner of homicides.

1343
01:54:39,370 --> 01:54:41,921
Sir, how are the conspiracy
and fraud charges related to

1344
01:54:41,946 --> 01:54:44,229
the deaths of Lamar Blackburn
and his sister, Rita?

1345
01:54:44,254 --> 01:54:47,094
This is a very fluid situation.

1346
01:54:47,119 --> 01:54:50,798
With a lot of surprising revelations
over the last 48 hours.

1347
01:54:50,823 --> 01:54:55,011
Let me introduce you to the person
leading the investigation.

1348
01:54:55,579 --> 01:54:56,991
Agent Medina.

1349
01:54:57,016 --> 01:54:58,461
Agent Medina.

1350
01:55:08,395 --> 01:55:10,211
Good afternoon.

1351
01:55:13,216 --> 01:55:16,455
As much as I
like to take credit for this,

1352
01:55:17,605 --> 01:55:19,206
I can't.

1353
01:55:26,807 --> 01:55:29,598
Because this was...
a team effort,

1354
01:55:29,927 --> 01:55:34,647
comprised of long hours of good
old-fashioned investigative work.

1355
01:55:34,672 --> 01:55:36,099
Questions?

1356
01:55:40,375 --> 01:55:41,744
Harbor Neuroscience
Hanover, New Hampshire

1357
01:55:41,769 --> 01:55:45,270
He was just like our other two,
he was a happy baby.

1358
01:55:45,616 --> 01:55:49,643
Now, he rarely speaks.
It's like, our child is missing.

1359
01:55:49,687 --> 01:55:53,911
He's not there.
He's lost and he needs our help.

1360
01:55:54,792 --> 01:55:56,400
We thought...

1361
01:55:57,961 --> 01:56:02,552
We thought...
we hoped that he'd catch back up,

1362
01:56:03,059 --> 01:56:04,476
but he didn't.

1363
01:56:04,501 --> 01:56:09,764
1 in 68 children in this country are
diagnosed with a form of autism.

1364
01:56:09,902 --> 01:56:13,069
But if you can put aside for a moment
what your pediatrician

1365
01:56:13,094 --> 01:56:15,795
 and all the other NT's
have said about your son...

1366
01:56:15,820 --> 01:56:17,122
“NT's”?

1367
01:56:17,147 --> 01:56:21,095
 “Neuro-typicals.”
 The rest of us.

1368
01:56:22,119 --> 01:56:23,986
What if we're wrong?

1369
01:56:24,354 --> 01:56:30,293
What if we've been using the wrong tests
to quantify intelligence in children with autism?

1370
01:56:31,651 --> 01:56:33,912
Your son's not less-than.

1371
01:56:34,604 --> 01:56:36,429
He's different.

1372
01:56:36,800 --> 01:56:40,793
Now, your expectations for your son
may change over time,

1373
01:56:40,804 --> 01:56:45,951
they might include marriage,
children, self-sufficiency.

1374
01:56:45,976 --> 01:56:47,917
They might not.

1375
01:56:48,180 --> 01:56:49,297
But I guarantee you.

1376
01:56:49,321 --> 01:56:52,107
If we let the world set
expectations for our children,

1377
01:56:52,132 --> 01:56:53,993
they'll start low

1378
01:56:55,149 --> 01:56:57,034
and they'll stay there.

1379
01:56:57,736 --> 01:57:01,267
Maybe your son is capable
of much more than you know.

1380
01:57:02,359 --> 01:57:05,983
And maybe...
Just maybe...

1381
01:57:06,492 --> 01:57:09,147
He doesn't understand
how to tell us.

1382
01:57:10,045 --> 01:57:11,538
Or...

1383
01:57:12,444 --> 01:57:15,038
we haven't yet
learned how to listen.

1384
01:57:40,705 --> 01:57:44,325
Hey, honey, for the hundredth time,
don't wonder off like that.

1385
01:57:44,367 --> 01:57:46,807
- I'm so sorry.
- It's alright. It's fine.

1386
01:57:46,832 --> 01:57:49,483
Can he visit with you
for a while, Justine?

1387
01:57:50,809 --> 01:57:51,824
Okay, good.

1388
01:57:51,849 --> 01:57:54,939
- C'mon, folks, I'll give you the nickel tour.
- You okay with that?

1389
01:57:54,964 --> 01:57:56,751
It's okay.
Come on.

1390
01:57:56,776 --> 01:57:58,765
Oh, he'll be fine.

1391
01:58:01,118 --> 01:58:03,622
Justine's one of our few
full-time residents.

1392
01:58:03,647 --> 01:58:06,031
She stopped talking 30 years ago,

1393
01:58:06,056 --> 01:58:09,167
communicates with a digital translator now.

1394
01:58:09,392 --> 01:58:11,592
Doctor, how is Harbor funded?

1395
01:58:11,617 --> 01:58:14,940
We are fortunate to have
very generous private donors.

1396
01:58:14,965 --> 01:58:17,900
- I'll say they're generous.
- Why is that?

1397
01:58:17,901 --> 01:58:20,992
- That woman, Justine.
- My daughter.

1398
01:58:21,017 --> 01:58:22,160
She's your daughter?

1399
01:58:22,185 --> 01:58:24,742
The reason I started the Institute.

1400
01:58:24,976 --> 01:58:29,878
Justine's computer, it's a BX-32.
Water-cool, 12 Core.

1401
01:58:29,913 --> 01:58:32,764
That's right, you're a software engineer.

1402
01:58:32,916 --> 01:58:36,702
Well, some of our donors are
more generous than others.

1403
01:58:36,727 --> 01:58:39,148
Why?
Is that a good computer?

1404
01:58:39,173 --> 01:58:40,586
Good?

1405
01:58:40,924 --> 01:58:43,674
Doc, she could backdoor
the Pentagon with that rig.

1406
01:58:46,897 --> 01:58:50,120
Hello, Dreamboat.
Shall we chat?

1407
01:59:16,092 --> 01:59:17,489
- Hi.
- Hi.

1408
01:59:17,514 --> 01:59:19,050
Sign here, please.

1409
01:59:22,065 --> 01:59:23,458
Thank you.

1410
01:59:25,267 --> 01:59:27,085
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

1411
02:01:28,974 --> 02:01:34,032
