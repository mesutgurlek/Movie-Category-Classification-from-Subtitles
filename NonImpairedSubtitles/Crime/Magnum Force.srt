1
00:02:14,834 --> 00:02:18,964
<i>This is a.44 Magnum,</i>
<i>the most powerful handgun in the world.</i>

2
00:02:19,805 --> 00:02:21,966
<i>And it could blow your head clean off.</i>

3
00:02:23,209 --> 00:02:24,403
<i>Do you feel lucky?</i>

4
00:02:30,282 --> 00:02:33,843
Mr. Ricca!
How do you feel about your acquittal?

5
00:02:33,953 --> 00:02:37,354
It proves what I always said,
I had nothing to do with Scarza's murder.

6
00:02:37,423 --> 00:02:39,948
Who could have killed
Anthony Scarza and his family?

7
00:02:40,025 --> 00:02:42,585
That's a stupid question. Get off my back!

8
00:02:43,129 --> 00:02:47,156
Mr. Weinstein, explain the technicality
involving the lack of admissible evidence.

9
00:02:47,233 --> 00:02:50,293
That's a legality
that can't be explained at this time.

10
00:02:50,403 --> 00:02:53,236
Mr. Weinstein, you don't seem surprised
about the decision.

11
00:02:53,305 --> 00:02:55,865
I don't know why they waste
the taxpayers' money.

12
00:02:55,941 --> 00:02:59,934
This whole thing is an arbitrary attack
on a legitimate businessman.

13
00:03:00,312 --> 00:03:02,280
- Do you have any comments?
- What, dear?

14
00:03:02,348 --> 00:03:04,111
Do you have any other comments?

15
00:03:04,183 --> 00:03:06,617
I'll give you a comment:
Their minds are dead.

16
00:03:06,685 --> 00:03:09,153
- What do you mean by that?
- Their minds are dead.

17
00:03:09,221 --> 00:03:11,781
Mr. Ricca means he is very pleased
with the decision.

18
00:03:11,857 --> 00:03:13,984
There's a big crowd.
Do you fear for your life?

19
00:03:14,059 --> 00:03:15,754
No, of course not.

20
00:03:18,364 --> 00:03:19,388
Mr. Estabrook.

21
00:03:19,465 --> 00:03:22,400
As the prosecutor,
how do you feel about the court's decision?

22
00:03:22,468 --> 00:03:24,766
It's happened before,
it'll probably happen again.

23
00:03:24,837 --> 00:03:26,270
I have no more comments.

24
00:03:29,942 --> 00:03:32,172
I'm sorry, no comments. No comments!

25
00:03:32,545 --> 00:03:33,739
I have no comments.

26
00:03:48,494 --> 00:03:51,054
You know what I think?
I'll tell you what I think!

27
00:03:51,130 --> 00:03:53,064
Fuck the courts, that's what I think!

28
00:03:53,132 --> 00:03:57,068
They've already wasted too much time
worrying about the rights of killers!

29
00:03:57,136 --> 00:03:58,501
Ricca, you're a killer!

30
00:04:10,082 --> 00:04:11,447
Get in the car! Go on!

31
00:04:38,310 --> 00:04:39,299
Murderer!

32
00:04:59,832 --> 00:05:02,130
<i>Today the noted labor leader</i>
<i>Carmine Ricca...</i>

33
00:05:02,201 --> 00:05:05,637
<i>... was acquitted on a technicality:</i>
<i>The lack of admissible evidence.</i>

34
00:05:06,338 --> 00:05:08,499
Ricca had been charged with complicity...

35
00:05:08,574 --> 00:05:12,305
...in the murders of labor reformer
Anthony Scarza and his family.

36
00:05:12,778 --> 00:05:16,214
When he appeared outside
the courthouse this afternoon, a free man...

37
00:05:16,315 --> 00:05:19,113
<i>... it touched off a wild,</i>
<i>mob-like demonstration.</i>

38
00:05:19,518 --> 00:05:22,453
<i>But the police were finally able</i>
<i>to bring it under control...</i>

39
00:05:22,521 --> 00:05:25,012
<i>... and there have been</i>
<i>no reports of injuries.</i>

40
00:05:25,090 --> 00:05:28,992
<i>But one can expect an uproar</i>
<i>from an angry and alarmed crowd...</i>

41
00:05:29,161 --> 00:05:31,789
<i>... which fully expected Ricca</i>
<i>to be convicted.</i>

42
00:05:32,164 --> 00:05:35,463
<i>And I'm sure we haven't heard</i>
<i>the last of the Ricca case.</i>

43
00:05:36,368 --> 00:05:38,529
<i>Art Brown reporting from city hall.</i>

44
00:06:43,802 --> 00:06:44,666
Cop.

45
00:06:46,305 --> 00:06:47,795
Gino, for Christ's sake.

46
00:06:47,873 --> 00:06:51,775
Come on, Carmine.
I'm driving this thing like a baby carriage.

47
00:07:45,964 --> 00:07:48,125
Could I see your driver's license, please?

48
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:50,100
Do you know who that is
sitting back there?

49
00:07:50,169 --> 00:07:53,104
I'll still have to see
your driver's license, please.

50
00:07:53,539 --> 00:07:55,029
I'll have to find it.

51
00:07:55,407 --> 00:07:57,341
Do you know why you're being stopped?

52
00:07:58,777 --> 00:08:02,235
Yes, we know, Officer,
and you're making a big mistake.

53
00:08:02,548 --> 00:08:05,449
- You crossed a double line back there.
- A double line?

54
00:08:05,517 --> 00:08:06,916
Take it easy.

55
00:08:07,386 --> 00:08:09,479
Whatever you say, Officer.

56
00:08:12,024 --> 00:08:14,049
I just happened to find it, sir.

57
00:08:22,434 --> 00:08:24,095
That's right, Simple Simon.

58
00:08:24,536 --> 00:08:26,902
Check, see if it's stolen.

59
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:30,035
I want this bastard busted out of his job.

60
00:08:30,109 --> 00:08:33,601
We'll take care of this guy.
You fellas, just take it easy.

61
00:08:46,458 --> 00:08:49,689
- This car registered to you?
- To him.

62
00:08:50,329 --> 00:08:54,231
- I'll have to see the registration.
- Come on, give me that license.

63
00:09:34,373 --> 00:09:35,533
That's okay.

64
00:09:36,408 --> 00:09:38,308
Hi, Harry. Is this your case?

65
00:09:58,630 --> 00:09:59,619
Walter?

66
00:10:02,267 --> 00:10:04,633
Hello, Harry. What are you doing here?

67
00:10:05,270 --> 00:10:07,761
This couldn't have happened
to a nicer bunch.

68
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:11,105
Ricca, Weinstein, his attorney.
James Cantina, the driver.

69
00:10:11,844 --> 00:10:13,311
What about the bodyguard?

70
00:10:13,378 --> 00:10:15,778
We're checking that out now, Lieutenant.

71
00:10:15,848 --> 00:10:19,511
Looks like somebody saved
the taxpayers a lot of money, doesn't it?

72
00:10:20,085 --> 00:10:23,577
Callahan, what're you doing here?
You're on loan to stakeout.

73
00:10:24,256 --> 00:10:26,884
We had nothing hot on,
besides, we were close.

74
00:10:27,392 --> 00:10:31,556
Callahan, you get your lying ass in gear
and get back to that stake-out squad.

75
00:10:31,763 --> 00:10:33,697
Anything else, you call it in.

76
00:10:38,604 --> 00:10:42,472
- Who do you think did this, Briggs?
- You're on loan to stakeout, Callahan.

77
00:10:42,541 --> 00:10:45,032
That's right, Lieutenant, you saw to that.

78
00:10:45,510 --> 00:10:48,240
I've got nothing personal
against you, Callahan.

79
00:10:49,081 --> 00:10:51,811
But we can't have the public crying,
"police brutality"...

80
00:10:51,884 --> 00:10:53,875
...every time you're on the street.

81
00:10:53,952 --> 00:10:56,386
You just might need me on a job like this.

82
00:10:56,455 --> 00:10:58,616
Whoever did this was very good at it.

83
00:10:58,690 --> 00:11:00,783
You'd sure be the one to know, Harry.

84
00:11:00,859 --> 00:11:03,726
- Well, I just work for this city, Briggs.
- So do I.

85
00:11:04,630 --> 00:11:05,995
Longer than you.

86
00:11:06,798 --> 00:11:10,894
And I never had to take my gun out
of its holster, once. I'm proud of that.

87
00:11:12,304 --> 00:11:14,363
Well, you're a good man, Lieutenant.

88
00:11:15,007 --> 00:11:17,271
A good man always knows his limitations.

89
00:11:19,077 --> 00:11:22,979
- Lt. Briggs?
- Yeah?

90
00:11:24,917 --> 00:11:26,077
What did you get?

91
00:11:26,151 --> 00:11:28,847
Well, it looks like
they were killed with a Magnum.

92
00:11:28,987 --> 00:11:32,650
The boys now are checking
the blood types and for fingerprints.

93
00:11:35,594 --> 00:11:36,959
What do you have?

94
00:11:37,129 --> 00:11:41,566
Driver's license. Doesn't look at all
like the usual gangster crap, does it?

95
00:11:42,434 --> 00:11:45,164
Briggs has his nose up his ass today.

96
00:11:45,971 --> 00:11:49,134
I guess he thinks
that's where his promotion is.

97
00:11:49,408 --> 00:11:51,205
See you later, Harry.

98
00:11:52,678 --> 00:11:54,805
What's with you and Briggs anyway?

99
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:56,479
Jealousy.

100
00:11:56,748 --> 00:12:00,741
He knows this is the kind of case
I should be on. It's just a matter of time.

101
00:12:01,486 --> 00:12:03,647
Hey, Early, want to get in on this?

102
00:12:05,390 --> 00:12:06,880
What the hell is that about?

103
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:10,395
They're giving odds on how long
you'll stay alive being my partner.

104
00:12:10,462 --> 00:12:11,724
Are you kidding?

105
00:12:11,930 --> 00:12:13,022
Nope.

106
00:12:13,165 --> 00:12:14,962
How long did your last partner go?

107
00:12:15,033 --> 00:12:16,193
A couple of weeks.

108
00:12:16,268 --> 00:12:19,431
Don't worry, he's still alive,
teaching college.

109
00:12:20,505 --> 00:12:22,166
You have another trade, Smith?

110
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:23,764
No, no. Do you?

111
00:12:23,842 --> 00:12:25,673
No, but Bill Mackenzie does.

112
00:12:25,744 --> 00:12:27,871
Who in the hell is Bill Mackenzie?

113
00:12:27,980 --> 00:12:31,143
He's an ex-homicide man,
has a snack shop out at the airport.

114
00:12:31,216 --> 00:12:33,309
Greatest burgers in town. Hungry?

115
00:12:34,086 --> 00:12:37,283
- How can you be hungry after seeing that?
- Seeing what?

116
00:12:54,306 --> 00:12:57,867
So, Ricca finally bought it.
There must be hope for the world yet.

117
00:12:58,477 --> 00:13:00,445
How about you? Do you want something?

118
00:13:00,512 --> 00:13:04,414
- We got chili and garlic bread today.
- No, thank you. I don't feel very hungry.

119
00:13:04,483 --> 00:13:08,180
In broad daylight at close range?
Must've looked like ripe melons.

120
00:13:10,389 --> 00:13:13,483
<i>Operations Supervisor, Mr. Phoenix,</i>
<i>use white courtesy telephone.</i>

121
00:13:13,558 --> 00:13:15,048
Now all keep calm.

122
00:13:18,296 --> 00:13:20,423
I'll never forget the Floyd case.

123
00:13:20,499 --> 00:13:22,660
Got it with an axe during the rush hour.

124
00:13:23,468 --> 00:13:24,992
How about some cream pie?

125
00:13:25,070 --> 00:13:28,528
<i>Operations Supervisor, Mr. Phoenix,</i>
<i>use white courtesy telephone.</i>

126
00:13:28,607 --> 00:13:31,838
Must be trouble.
That's the airport code name for trouble.

127
00:14:17,522 --> 00:14:20,355
We've got 90 people being terrorized
by those maniacs...

128
00:14:20,425 --> 00:14:22,222
...in boarding area B right now.

129
00:14:22,294 --> 00:14:25,320
What's taking so long?
They said they'd be there in 15 minutes?

130
00:14:25,397 --> 00:14:26,887
Where's that overseas pilot?

131
00:14:26,965 --> 00:14:29,695
I don't understand.
How did they get through security?

132
00:14:29,768 --> 00:14:31,793
- I don't know.
- Any problems here?

133
00:14:31,870 --> 00:14:33,360
What are you doing here?

134
00:14:33,472 --> 00:14:36,236
- I'm sorry, you'll have to leave.
- I'm a police officer.

135
00:14:36,475 --> 00:14:39,638
We've got two frantic hijackers
on our New York flight.

136
00:14:40,779 --> 00:14:43,907
- Have you called the FBI?
- They're on their way here right now.

137
00:14:43,982 --> 00:14:47,008
But the hijackers want an overseas pilot
before they take off.

138
00:14:50,388 --> 00:14:52,083
May I make a suggestion?

139
00:15:25,690 --> 00:15:26,952
Good afternoon.

140
00:15:27,159 --> 00:15:30,094
You took your goddamn time about it.
Now, close that door!

141
00:15:30,495 --> 00:15:32,292
All right, what's in there?

142
00:15:33,431 --> 00:15:35,661
Overseas charts and flight plans.

143
00:15:35,734 --> 00:15:36,894
Set it down!

144
00:15:38,770 --> 00:15:40,397
All right, turn around.

145
00:15:46,278 --> 00:15:47,404
Stay there.

146
00:15:57,189 --> 00:15:59,020
All right, turn around here.

147
00:15:59,724 --> 00:16:01,885
Here! Now get in there!

148
00:16:04,329 --> 00:16:08,527
- It's all yours now.
- All right get this thing up!

149
00:16:11,369 --> 00:16:12,768
Where to?

150
00:16:13,438 --> 00:16:16,339
You get us up,
I'll tell you where to when we're up.

151
00:16:21,580 --> 00:16:24,048
You want to put us in take-off position?

152
00:16:28,987 --> 00:16:30,284
Starting three.

153
00:17:25,477 --> 00:17:26,705
Move it!

154
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:30,170
All right, I'll take it.

155
00:18:00,845 --> 00:18:04,246
That's right, Lieutenant. We were lucky
to have one of your men here.

156
00:18:04,316 --> 00:18:06,784
He's on board now, an Inspector Callahan.

157
00:18:07,686 --> 00:18:08,584
Callahan!

158
00:18:25,570 --> 00:18:29,131
Excuse me, Captain.
I know this may sound silly...

159
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:30,798
...but can you fly?

160
00:18:31,609 --> 00:18:34,203
No. Never had a lesson.

161
00:19:02,741 --> 00:19:03,730
Sit down!

162
00:19:47,986 --> 00:19:50,181
What are you doing here, Lieutenant?

163
00:20:24,022 --> 00:20:27,685
Harry! You crazy son of a bitch!
I could've killed you.

164
00:20:28,193 --> 00:20:30,923
Yeah, I noticed that, Charlie.
What the hell you doing?

165
00:20:30,995 --> 00:20:33,020
I haven't seen you in a coon's age.

166
00:20:33,097 --> 00:20:36,692
I been meaning to drop by,
but we've been kind of busy.

167
00:20:37,035 --> 00:20:40,402
Yeah, well,
I ain't living with Carol anymore.

168
00:20:41,406 --> 00:20:42,600
Sorry to hear that.

169
00:20:42,674 --> 00:20:46,735
Yeah. It's my third time at bat.

170
00:20:48,646 --> 00:20:49,874
Where's the time go?

171
00:20:51,182 --> 00:20:52,649
I'm afraid of time.

172
00:20:53,117 --> 00:20:57,486
I know you 10 years already, ever since
I first came out here, you realize that?

173
00:20:57,922 --> 00:21:00,720
You don't look older to me.
Do I look older to you?

174
00:21:04,229 --> 00:21:06,720
Why don't you put in
for some desk work, Charlie?

175
00:21:06,798 --> 00:21:08,698
You don't need the streets anymore.

176
00:21:08,766 --> 00:21:10,961
We should've put our 20 in the Marines.

177
00:21:11,269 --> 00:21:15,171
These days,
a cop kills a hoodlum on the street...

178
00:21:15,340 --> 00:21:17,831
...he might as well just dump
the body some place.

179
00:21:17,909 --> 00:21:20,275
Because those snot-nosed
young bastards...

180
00:21:20,345 --> 00:21:23,940
...down at the DA's office will crucify them
one way or another.

181
00:21:24,015 --> 00:21:26,950
A hood can kill a cop,
but let a cop kill a hood...

182
00:21:27,685 --> 00:21:28,811
Am I right?

183
00:21:30,788 --> 00:21:34,690
You put in plenty of time,
why don't you go for retirement?

184
00:21:35,326 --> 00:21:37,157
What the hell, you don't need this.

185
00:21:37,562 --> 00:21:41,589
I know you 10 years.
I'll tell you something, I'll never retire.

186
00:21:41,966 --> 00:21:42,955
Never!

187
00:21:44,736 --> 00:21:46,465
I'm going out fighting.

188
00:21:47,171 --> 00:21:49,537
That's the only way to go. Am I right?

189
00:22:43,394 --> 00:22:44,520
You boys rookies?

190
00:22:44,896 --> 00:22:46,625
Yes, sir. Traffic.

191
00:22:46,864 --> 00:22:49,298
I'm John Davis. This is Phil Sweet.

192
00:22:49,968 --> 00:22:52,801
That's Red Astrachan, Mike Grimes.

193
00:22:53,137 --> 00:22:55,935
- You're Inspector Harry Callahan, no?
- That's right.

194
00:22:56,007 --> 00:22:59,033
What are you doing here?
Don't you have regular times for this?

195
00:22:59,110 --> 00:23:02,011
You shouldn't be on the streets
if you can't shoot well.

196
00:23:02,180 --> 00:23:05,479
- Killers don't make allowances.
- You're in big trouble.

197
00:23:05,750 --> 00:23:07,047
Can't fault you there.

198
00:23:07,118 --> 00:23:09,780
Are you shooting
in the combat championship next week?

199
00:23:09,854 --> 00:23:10,786
I always do.

200
00:23:10,855 --> 00:23:14,484
- You win every year, don't you?
- Became sort of an institution around here.

201
00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:16,754
Yes, sir, we've heard all about you.

202
00:23:18,630 --> 00:23:22,122
This is about the only time
I get this place alone.

203
00:23:22,433 --> 00:23:25,163
We'll leave if you'd like
the range to yourself.

204
00:23:28,873 --> 00:23:30,397
No, that's all right.

205
00:23:32,644 --> 00:23:35,112
What kind of a load do you use in that.44?

206
00:23:35,179 --> 00:23:36,612
A light special.

207
00:23:36,681 --> 00:23:39,514
This size gun gives me better control
and less recoil...

208
00:23:39,584 --> 00:23:42,212
...than a.357 Magnum with wadcutters.

209
00:24:12,050 --> 00:24:13,574
That's not bad.

210
00:24:15,453 --> 00:24:16,545
Care to try?

211
00:24:16,621 --> 00:24:18,316
No, sir. No, I don't think so.

212
00:24:18,389 --> 00:24:21,085
- Come on, give it a try.
- Go on, Sweet.

213
00:24:24,729 --> 00:24:26,026
I'm farsighted.

214
00:24:31,402 --> 00:24:32,426
Don't drop it.

215
00:24:52,190 --> 00:24:53,521
Hey, that's not bad.

216
00:24:53,825 --> 00:24:57,158
Well, I think it's just a little heavy for me.
I missed one.

217
00:24:57,261 --> 00:24:58,626
You'll get used to it.

218
00:24:59,030 --> 00:25:01,294
Where did you learn to shoot?
Not around here.

219
00:25:01,365 --> 00:25:04,198
No, sir, no.
Airborne Rangers, Special Forces.

220
00:25:06,170 --> 00:25:08,297
And the rest of these guys, even close?

221
00:25:08,372 --> 00:25:10,840
Well, Grimes here, he's...

222
00:25:11,409 --> 00:25:13,343
...I guess he's about even with me.

223
00:25:13,411 --> 00:25:16,437
Astrachan's a little better on a good day.

224
00:25:16,981 --> 00:25:19,609
And Davis is just dog nuts.
He's a lot better.

225
00:25:20,752 --> 00:25:25,815
A lot better? Sure show a sense of style.
Sweet, is it?

226
00:25:25,890 --> 00:25:26,982
Yes, sir.

227
00:25:27,391 --> 00:25:30,383
When I get back on Homicide,
I hope you boys will come see me.

228
00:25:30,461 --> 00:25:32,429
- Good.
- Thank you very much, we'd like that.

229
00:25:32,497 --> 00:25:34,124
Let's go!

230
00:25:34,198 --> 00:25:36,098
- Good night, sir.
- Good night.

231
00:25:37,902 --> 00:25:39,733
Who buys? The sun was in my eyes!

232
00:25:39,804 --> 00:25:43,001
- You got to be on, Grimes.
- The sun is always in your eyes.

233
00:25:43,374 --> 00:25:46,832
How come I always have to buy
the beer for you turkeys.

234
00:25:48,246 --> 00:25:50,578
Where do you want to go?

235
00:26:38,262 --> 00:26:39,991
Put your hat on!

236
00:26:40,064 --> 00:26:41,793
Come on now, baby.

237
00:26:52,143 --> 00:26:54,611
Will you look at my ring!

238
00:27:18,669 --> 00:27:19,727
It's beautiful!

239
00:28:40,851 --> 00:28:42,216
Is this a gang war?

240
00:28:42,286 --> 00:28:43,913
You have nothing to say?

241
00:28:44,188 --> 00:28:47,919
- Do you expect more murder or violence?
- I have nothing to say at this time.

242
00:28:48,092 --> 00:28:50,617
- Is this a gang war, Lieutenant?
- No comment.

243
00:28:50,695 --> 00:28:55,064
There were 200 murders last year.
Do you want to make a comment on that?

244
00:28:57,802 --> 00:29:01,329
There'll be no bombs in pools.
This town belongs to the people.

245
00:29:01,505 --> 00:29:03,598
We're gonna have law and order here.

246
00:29:04,375 --> 00:29:06,400
<i>That's all I have to say at this time.</i>

247
00:29:06,477 --> 00:29:08,672
<i>What does that mean, Lieutenant?</i>

248
00:29:18,322 --> 00:29:21,086
You're it!

249
00:29:26,197 --> 00:29:27,391
You're it!

250
00:29:28,632 --> 00:29:30,623
Don't you want to play with us?

251
00:29:30,835 --> 00:29:33,861
- Well, I don't know, sweetheart.
- Just a little while?

252
00:29:33,938 --> 00:29:36,236
You're really getting the full treatment.

253
00:29:36,307 --> 00:29:38,775
It's not often you get a sit-down dinner.

254
00:29:40,444 --> 00:29:43,936
Okay, kids. All right, that's enough.

255
00:29:44,982 --> 00:29:48,418
- Just a little bit more, just five minutes?
- Let's go, let's go.

256
00:29:48,486 --> 00:29:50,784
Say good night to Harry and off to bed.

257
00:29:50,855 --> 00:29:52,914
- Good night.
- Good night, my love.

258
00:29:54,458 --> 00:29:56,323
- Good night.
- Take it easy.

259
00:29:56,527 --> 00:29:58,688
- 'Bye.
- Good night, Harry.

260
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:05,828
Take the jacket out of your mouth,
sweetheart.

261
00:30:15,212 --> 00:30:17,578
Boy, sometimes they're too much for me.

262
00:30:19,050 --> 00:30:21,883
But then I can't afford
a woman coming in anymore.

263
00:30:23,220 --> 00:30:24,847
I think you manage quite well.

264
00:30:24,922 --> 00:30:26,947
Well, I just laugh all day long.

265
00:30:28,759 --> 00:30:30,249
I'm glad you called.

266
00:30:32,463 --> 00:30:35,125
Tell me, have you seen Charlie?

267
00:30:37,101 --> 00:30:38,830
Yes, I saw him last night.

268
00:30:38,903 --> 00:30:40,370
Wanted to see the kids...

269
00:30:40,438 --> 00:30:44,101
...and then he started playing
a little Russian roulette with his revolver.

270
00:30:45,142 --> 00:30:46,404
What happened?

271
00:30:46,710 --> 00:30:50,476
What could I do? I went next door,
we finally got him to stop.

272
00:30:50,614 --> 00:30:52,275
What do you tell your children...

273
00:30:52,349 --> 00:30:55,546
...when they ask why their father
tried to shoot himself?

274
00:30:56,487 --> 00:30:58,114
What did you tell them?

275
00:30:58,889 --> 00:31:02,552
I just said it was a special kind of sickness
that some people have...

276
00:31:02,626 --> 00:31:06,858
...and that there are doctors
who could cure it... as if they could.

277
00:31:10,167 --> 00:31:12,431
Do you know where he's living right now?

278
00:31:13,471 --> 00:31:16,065
I don't know and I don't care anymore.

279
00:31:18,342 --> 00:31:22,335
He's so sick.
He shouldn't be allowed to carry a gun.

280
00:31:27,418 --> 00:31:31,115
Do you know that he was living
in North Beach with some nude dancer?

281
00:31:37,828 --> 00:31:40,319
Oh, well, I'm glad I'm over that one.

282
00:31:42,133 --> 00:31:43,930
I do have to survive.

283
00:31:44,401 --> 00:31:45,425
You will.

284
00:31:48,973 --> 00:31:53,637
You know, Harry, if I ask you
a personal question, would you mind?

285
00:31:54,411 --> 00:31:55,935
Sure, go ahead.

286
00:31:57,047 --> 00:32:01,279
Are you sure?
Because, well, it's a little difficult.

287
00:32:02,987 --> 00:32:06,047
Look, we've been friends a long time,
go ahead and ask.

288
00:32:10,027 --> 00:32:13,895
Well, I'm just wondering
why you've never made a pass at me.

289
00:32:20,237 --> 00:32:21,101
Why?

290
00:32:25,242 --> 00:32:26,607
Goddamn it.

291
00:32:29,346 --> 00:32:32,281
With all those kids
do you think I'll ever get laid?

292
00:32:42,126 --> 00:32:43,093
Hello?

293
00:32:45,329 --> 00:32:47,024
Yes, just a moment.

294
00:32:47,331 --> 00:32:49,265
It's for you.

295
00:32:50,134 --> 00:32:51,761
What's happening?

296
00:32:51,936 --> 00:32:52,903
Yeah?

297
00:32:53,938 --> 00:32:55,667
Yeah, Early, I saw it on TV.

298
00:32:58,175 --> 00:33:00,439
I'll be right down.
I'll come in the back way.

299
00:33:04,248 --> 00:33:06,273
- That's it, right?
- I have to go.

300
00:33:07,117 --> 00:33:08,516
Goodnight, Harry.

301
00:33:10,554 --> 00:33:12,021
Goodnight, sweetheart.

302
00:34:14,585 --> 00:34:15,745
How's it going?

303
00:34:15,886 --> 00:34:17,513
By the magazine rack.

304
00:34:18,022 --> 00:34:21,685
The owner remembers seeing him
just before the last robbery.

305
00:34:22,359 --> 00:34:25,351
Yeah, he doesn't look much
like a paying customer, does he?

306
00:34:26,730 --> 00:34:30,291
- There's a car parked out in front.
- That's right, a no parking zone.

307
00:34:30,768 --> 00:34:33,032
Get over there by the door
with that shotgun.

308
00:34:33,103 --> 00:34:34,001
Okay.

309
00:34:39,109 --> 00:34:41,270
You think it'll be a hit or a miss?

310
00:35:25,022 --> 00:35:27,582
Well, here's three salty looking dudes.

311
00:35:41,305 --> 00:35:42,602
Freeze, nigger!

312
00:35:43,974 --> 00:35:46,875
- What you got there?
- Don't you go setting off no alarm.

313
00:35:47,277 --> 00:35:48,972
You! Get over here, fast!

314
00:35:50,047 --> 00:35:52,311
- You got a safe, nigger?
- No.

315
00:35:52,950 --> 00:35:54,577
You lying sack of shit.

316
00:35:59,590 --> 00:36:02,286
All right, take it easy. Take it easy now.

317
00:36:02,893 --> 00:36:03,882
Suck it!

318
00:36:05,662 --> 00:36:06,651
Suck it!

319
00:36:08,132 --> 00:36:10,157
I'll kill you. I said, suck it.

320
00:36:13,036 --> 00:36:14,367
You go find that safe.

321
00:36:17,641 --> 00:36:20,007
Right here is where I kill me a nigger.

322
00:36:21,378 --> 00:36:22,777
Get on your knees.

323
00:36:24,548 --> 00:36:25,947
Get on your knees.

324
00:36:30,654 --> 00:36:31,814
Better get out there now.

325
00:36:31,889 --> 00:36:32,947
Not yet.

326
00:36:34,725 --> 00:36:35,953
Get on your knees.

327
00:36:58,649 --> 00:36:59,616
Police!

328
00:36:59,883 --> 00:37:00,645
Drop it!

329
00:37:05,355 --> 00:37:06,822
All right, hold it!

330
00:37:56,974 --> 00:37:58,441
I never shot a man.

331
00:38:01,912 --> 00:38:04,005
Why don't you help the lady?

332
00:38:06,383 --> 00:38:08,408
It's all right, ma'am.

333
00:38:34,378 --> 00:38:36,403
You handled yourself real well tonight.

334
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:39,108
You work close. Man, you work close.

335
00:38:44,454 --> 00:38:46,319
Hey, where are you guys off to?

336
00:38:46,390 --> 00:38:49,985
- The Downtown Bowl on Eddy Street.
- Oh, yeah. See you later.

337
00:38:50,460 --> 00:38:53,623
- You know them?
- They came from the academy after me.

338
00:38:53,697 --> 00:38:55,597
They stick together like fly paper.

339
00:38:55,666 --> 00:38:58,464
Everybody thought
they were queer for each other.

340
00:38:58,869 --> 00:39:02,100
I'll tell you something,
if the rest of you could shoot like them...

341
00:39:02,172 --> 00:39:05,403
...I wouldn't care
if the whole damn department was queer.

342
00:39:23,594 --> 00:39:25,585
Excuse me, it's very important.

343
00:39:28,298 --> 00:39:29,993
What do you think you're doing?

344
00:39:42,279 --> 00:39:43,906
1000 O'Farrell.

345
00:40:05,669 --> 00:40:09,799
We're not going to get there
unless you keep your eyes on the road.

346
00:40:10,674 --> 00:40:13,108
Right on. 1000 O'Farrell.

347
00:40:52,082 --> 00:40:53,982
Too bad you're not on welfare.

348
00:40:55,152 --> 00:40:56,779
I'd give you a freebie.

349
00:41:03,093 --> 00:41:04,025
Drive.

350
00:41:11,635 --> 00:41:14,968
- Sidney, I was just on my way to see you.
- Where to?

351
00:41:15,072 --> 00:41:18,200
- Just keep on going until I tell you to stop.
- Yes, sir.

352
00:41:18,408 --> 00:41:19,705
Drop that flag.

353
00:41:22,145 --> 00:41:24,739
- You're on your way to see me?
- Yes, Sidney, honest.

354
00:41:24,815 --> 00:41:26,908
How come you didn't come by the crib?

355
00:41:26,983 --> 00:41:28,610
- Well...
- Don't shit me.

356
00:41:28,885 --> 00:41:30,079
I wouldn't do that.

357
00:41:30,153 --> 00:41:33,850
- I've been waiting for you for one week.
- I've been working the convention.

358
00:41:33,924 --> 00:41:37,223
- No telephones in that hotel?
- I've been working like hell, you know?

359
00:41:39,663 --> 00:41:41,028
Let me show you.

360
00:41:44,067 --> 00:41:46,934
- See? It's all here, all I got.
- AII?

361
00:41:47,804 --> 00:41:50,034
Looks like you've been holding out on me.

362
00:41:50,107 --> 00:41:53,804
No, I haven't. I've been straight
with you, Sidney. You know me.

363
00:41:54,111 --> 00:41:57,945
Damn right I know you. Let's see
how much there is in the titty bank.

364
00:42:00,250 --> 00:42:01,877
Hello, Mr. Green.

365
00:42:04,721 --> 00:42:06,518
Check out the snatch bank, too.

366
00:42:09,693 --> 00:42:11,456
Damn right I know you.

367
00:42:11,595 --> 00:42:14,723
I was gonna give it all to you,
but you didn't give me a chance.

368
00:42:14,798 --> 00:42:17,358
Bitch, you had your chance.
I was your last chance.

369
00:42:17,434 --> 00:42:19,800
Everybody else in town
threw your black ass out.

370
00:42:21,138 --> 00:42:21,968
Help me!

371
00:45:41,838 --> 00:45:44,773
Good day, sir.
Is this car registered to you?

372
00:45:45,208 --> 00:45:46,971
Yes, sir. This is my car.

373
00:45:47,711 --> 00:45:50,703
You must be new. You know who I am?

374
00:45:51,181 --> 00:45:54,048
I'll still have to see your license
and registration, sir.

375
00:45:54,117 --> 00:45:57,086
I believe you were speeding
coming across the bridge.

376
00:46:57,313 --> 00:46:58,177
Hi.

377
00:46:59,682 --> 00:47:00,546
Hi.

378
00:47:01,684 --> 00:47:02,776
What's your name?

379
00:47:02,986 --> 00:47:04,010
Sunny.

380
00:47:05,455 --> 00:47:09,721
I've been living here for six months now.
It's funny I've never met you before.

381
00:47:10,660 --> 00:47:12,560
Well, I work a lot.

382
00:47:12,896 --> 00:47:13,988
I know.

383
00:47:14,297 --> 00:47:17,198
- You're the cop who lives upstairs.
- That's right.

384
00:47:17,734 --> 00:47:19,361
Mind if I ask you a question?

385
00:47:20,103 --> 00:47:21,127
No, go ahead.

386
00:47:21,971 --> 00:47:24,439
What does a girl have to do
to go to bed with you?

387
00:47:30,780 --> 00:47:32,680
Try knocking on the door.

388
00:48:55,165 --> 00:48:56,496
- Hi.
- Hi.

389
00:48:58,401 --> 00:49:00,266
Do you always live in the dark?

390
00:49:00,336 --> 00:49:04,397
Well, you meet a better class of people
in the dark sometimes. Come on in.

391
00:49:09,579 --> 00:49:10,603
Sit down.

392
00:49:20,123 --> 00:49:23,422
Harry, this is Briggs. Are you alone?

393
00:49:23,493 --> 00:49:26,257
No, actually,
I'm entertaining a young lady friend.

394
00:49:26,563 --> 00:49:30,556
Put your pants back on, Callahan,
and come to the city morgue right away.

395
00:49:31,100 --> 00:49:33,227
The morgue? What the hell for, Briggs?

396
00:49:33,369 --> 00:49:36,395
I'm not on homicide anymore.
I'm a stake-out man now, remember?

397
00:49:36,806 --> 00:49:38,034
Not anymore, Callahan.

398
00:49:38,107 --> 00:49:40,371
You and your partner
are back on homicide.

399
00:49:40,743 --> 00:49:43,906
This is a little dramatic, isn't it, Briggs?
Not your usual style.

400
00:49:43,980 --> 00:49:45,538
It's meant to be, Callahan.

401
00:49:45,748 --> 00:49:48,979
This thing might be bigger
than even we think it is.

402
00:49:50,286 --> 00:49:52,186
Hijacking and gambling.

403
00:49:54,958 --> 00:49:55,982
Trucking.

404
00:49:59,862 --> 00:50:01,727
Narcotics and prostitution.

405
00:50:01,798 --> 00:50:03,390
This is the cream in the bottle.

406
00:50:03,466 --> 00:50:05,696
Someone wants
to put the courts out of business.

407
00:50:05,768 --> 00:50:07,998
So far, you've said nothing wrong.

408
00:50:08,071 --> 00:50:10,062
This one just came in an hour ago.

409
00:50:10,340 --> 00:50:13,309
Somebody wants it all.
This guy was just a pimp.

410
00:50:13,776 --> 00:50:15,266
That's one of his girls.

411
00:50:15,712 --> 00:50:17,077
How did she get it?

412
00:50:17,347 --> 00:50:21,511
Sometime before he got hit, he poured
a can of drain cleaner down her throat.

413
00:50:22,952 --> 00:50:25,147
That shows a certain sense of style.

414
00:50:25,989 --> 00:50:27,684
You're all heart, Callahan.

415
00:50:27,757 --> 00:50:30,351
Am I gonna have to have him
leaning over my shoulder?

416
00:50:30,426 --> 00:50:32,792
You work with Briggs on this, Callahan.

417
00:50:33,129 --> 00:50:37,327
But if you ever lean out of line, so help me,
I'll flop you lower than whale shit.

418
00:50:37,400 --> 00:50:40,233
Speaking of whale shit,
what have you turned up, Briggs?

419
00:50:40,303 --> 00:50:42,669
Nobody in my department
is sitting on their ass.

420
00:50:42,739 --> 00:50:44,764
See this thing, Callahan? The chief.

421
00:50:44,841 --> 00:50:47,469
He calls me on this all the time.
Even in the can.

422
00:50:47,543 --> 00:50:49,636
I haven't been out of my shoes
in 48 hours...

423
00:50:49,712 --> 00:50:52,272
...and still we have no witnesses, not one.

424
00:50:52,348 --> 00:50:55,579
In these cases, there's always
an officer right on top of the crime.

425
00:50:55,652 --> 00:50:57,483
But nobody's ever seen a thing.

426
00:50:58,521 --> 00:51:01,752
- Who was the officer on this one?
- A patrolman, Sweet.

427
00:51:01,858 --> 00:51:03,155
Wasn't it, Briggs?

428
00:51:03,426 --> 00:51:05,257
Sweet seems like a good man.

429
00:51:05,595 --> 00:51:08,530
I'll get on the ballistic reports
first thing in the morning.

430
00:51:08,598 --> 00:51:11,931
We ran all the slugs through ballistics.
We'll never see those guns.

431
00:51:12,001 --> 00:51:14,629
It was too professional,
you're wasting your time.

432
00:51:15,104 --> 00:51:16,935
Well, it takes me time, Briggs.

433
00:51:19,676 --> 00:51:21,940
A man has to know his limitations.

434
00:52:01,718 --> 00:52:02,878
Warm enough?

435
00:52:09,892 --> 00:52:11,120
You're my first cop.

436
00:52:15,298 --> 00:52:17,926
Guess that'll be two firsts tonight,
won't it?

437
00:52:56,072 --> 00:52:57,699
What do the others look like?

438
00:52:57,774 --> 00:53:00,140
The gun was a.357 Magnum.

439
00:53:00,510 --> 00:53:03,479
The other bullets are all too deformed
to do us any good.

440
00:53:03,546 --> 00:53:07,744
Hollow points, fired point-blank, you know.
We were lucky to get these two.

441
00:53:08,418 --> 00:53:10,716
I found them in the pimp's car.

442
00:53:11,154 --> 00:53:12,883
.357 Magnum?

443
00:53:15,425 --> 00:53:18,019
Maybe it's a cop. Maybe it's Harry.

444
00:53:18,594 --> 00:53:20,994
Nobody hates hoodlums
as much as he does.

445
00:53:24,634 --> 00:53:26,465
Whoever it is, he enjoys it.

446
00:53:27,003 --> 00:53:29,471
It's possible the man was dead
with the first shot.

447
00:53:29,539 --> 00:53:31,905
The others were thrown in
just for good measure.

448
00:53:31,974 --> 00:53:35,410
- He unloaded a whole magazine into him.
- One big mothering hole, huh?

449
00:53:38,414 --> 00:53:40,678
Well, everybody has to pay something.

450
00:53:42,351 --> 00:53:45,684
He would have to be standing right here,
this close...

451
00:53:46,155 --> 00:53:47,645
...point-blank range.

452
00:53:51,227 --> 00:53:54,458
The driver's license
and the $100 bill were out.

453
00:53:54,597 --> 00:53:57,293
Almost like he was showing it
to a traffic cop.

454
00:53:57,400 --> 00:53:58,424
Yeah.

455
00:53:59,168 --> 00:54:03,696
From what we have, it figures somebody
to be impersonating a police officer.

456
00:54:03,906 --> 00:54:06,636
On the cars, at least.
It's been done before.

457
00:54:07,643 --> 00:54:11,704
This close, it would have to be
somebody he would never recognize.

458
00:54:12,415 --> 00:54:14,042
Or never suspect.

459
00:54:18,287 --> 00:54:21,814
Lou Guzman, ex-meat lugger
with a first-grade education.

460
00:54:23,059 --> 00:54:26,324
He started working for the old boss
of bosses as a hitter.

461
00:54:27,263 --> 00:54:31,097
He controls narcotics state-wide,
and now dabbles in prostitution...

462
00:54:32,168 --> 00:54:35,331
...has big friends everywhere.
I want Casale and DiGiorgio on him.

463
00:54:35,404 --> 00:54:36,996
Next. Thank you.

464
00:54:38,040 --> 00:54:41,498
This one is for your special talents,
Callahan.

465
00:54:42,445 --> 00:54:43,912
Frank Palancio.

466
00:54:44,914 --> 00:54:46,882
Two hundred and twelve pounds.

467
00:54:47,917 --> 00:54:51,375
Indicted for murder 23 times,
no convictions.

468
00:54:52,488 --> 00:54:54,479
Complains about his health now.

469
00:54:54,957 --> 00:54:58,859
Suffers from ulcers, migraine headaches.
Dangerously violent.

470
00:55:00,396 --> 00:55:02,830
At one point,
he was Ricca's principle assassin.

471
00:55:02,899 --> 00:55:05,367
If you mix it with him, he won't back off.

472
00:55:06,035 --> 00:55:07,559
He's all yours, Callahan.

473
00:55:07,637 --> 00:55:10,299
That's very nice, Lieutenant,
but I don't think Palancio...

474
00:55:10,373 --> 00:55:12,204
I want you on him, Callahan.

475
00:55:12,308 --> 00:55:15,971
I'd bust Palancio for stepping
on a crack on the sidewalk if I could...

476
00:55:16,112 --> 00:55:19,707
...but this isn't his style.
Not the cars anyway, it's too direct.

477
00:55:19,982 --> 00:55:23,349
Callahan, you just keep your nose
pressed against Palancio's ass...

478
00:55:23,419 --> 00:55:26,855
...until I get a warrant
from the DA's office to bring him in.

479
00:55:26,923 --> 00:55:29,289
And I want the first conviction
on this animal.

480
00:55:29,625 --> 00:55:32,287
Conviction?
He's liable to be your next victim.

481
00:55:32,562 --> 00:55:34,723
What are you asking for, Lieutenant?

482
00:55:34,797 --> 00:55:40,064
I'm not asking you to follow him, Inspector.
For the last goddamn time, I'm telling you.

483
00:55:40,403 --> 00:55:41,301
Next.

484
00:55:43,039 --> 00:55:46,736
Nick Royale, Palancio's No. 1 hitter.

485
00:55:47,743 --> 00:55:49,370
He's had good training.

486
00:56:13,736 --> 00:56:15,067
What's happening?

487
00:56:15,204 --> 00:56:18,435
Nothing, just a lot of peeping and checking,
checking and peeping.

488
00:56:18,507 --> 00:56:21,704
I knew an old boy once
who used to keep pigs under his bed.

489
00:56:21,777 --> 00:56:23,608
Pigs? The eating kind?

490
00:56:23,679 --> 00:56:27,046
The eating kind.
Is all you ever think of your stomach?

491
00:56:33,656 --> 00:56:36,386
That's very interesting.
I think we better get going.

492
00:56:36,459 --> 00:56:37,323
Yeah.

493
00:57:59,742 --> 00:58:03,508
- They're splitting up. Which one, Harry?
- We'll stay with these two.

494
00:58:05,214 --> 00:58:07,944
Across the bridge,
it's out of our jurisdiction.

495
00:58:08,017 --> 00:58:09,348
Yeah.

496
00:58:13,589 --> 00:58:14,578
Well?

497
00:58:15,624 --> 00:58:16,921
Stick with the money.

498
00:58:39,415 --> 00:58:40,882
Pull over and stop.

499
00:58:56,465 --> 00:59:00,026
What are you trying to do?
He doesn't even know we're cops.

500
00:59:00,770 --> 00:59:04,069
He may panic, and besides,
we don't belong over here anyway.

501
00:59:04,874 --> 00:59:06,398
I hope he does panic.

502
00:59:08,377 --> 00:59:10,937
Then I'll get him for 23 other murders.

503
00:59:11,213 --> 00:59:12,976
And if he doesn't...

504
00:59:13,315 --> 00:59:16,512
...then I may be right about something
that's been nagging at me.

505
00:59:16,652 --> 00:59:18,347
I sure hope I'm not.

506
00:59:19,155 --> 00:59:20,179
What?

507
00:59:20,790 --> 00:59:23,258
I don't want to be winning bets
for anybody.

508
00:59:36,906 --> 00:59:39,204
Go a little faster, I'm on their side.

509
00:59:40,042 --> 00:59:42,840
- Roll down your window.
- What? Are you out of your mind?

510
00:59:42,912 --> 00:59:46,245
- I've never been wrong yet, have I?
- I don't know why I'm doing this.

511
00:59:46,438 --> 00:59:50,396
- Say, excuse me. Could you help us out?
- What do you want?

512
00:59:50,675 --> 00:59:53,109
Maybe you could help us,
we seem to be lost.

513
00:59:53,177 --> 00:59:56,738
We were looking for the entrance
to San Quentin. You know where that is?

514
00:59:56,814 --> 00:59:58,941
It's back there. Don't you see too good?

515
00:59:59,017 --> 01:00:03,044
Yeah, I see fine. I just wanted to know
whether you knew where San Quentin was.

516
01:00:03,254 --> 01:00:05,484
And you do, don't you, asshole.

517
01:00:12,997 --> 01:00:15,192
Get you yet, you son of a bitch.

518
01:00:19,203 --> 01:00:21,899
You always gotta do things your way,
don't you?

519
01:00:22,307 --> 01:00:24,502
No wonder Briggs stays on your tail.

520
01:00:26,477 --> 01:00:30,436
You do things someone else's way
and you take your life in your own hands.

521
01:00:50,868 --> 01:00:52,665
That son of a bitch Guzman!

522
01:00:53,972 --> 01:00:56,668
He hasn't gone out for almost
24 hours now.

523
01:01:23,334 --> 01:01:25,165
Hey, one of our guys took a spill.

524
01:01:26,637 --> 01:01:29,834
It's Charlie McCoy! Seems to be okay.

525
01:01:30,608 --> 01:01:32,075
Let me take a look.

526
01:01:33,478 --> 01:01:34,968
Yeah, he's okay.

527
01:01:45,957 --> 01:01:47,618
There he is.

528
01:01:48,593 --> 01:01:51,653
So, all you've got to do
is sit around all day, Guzman?

529
01:02:24,262 --> 01:02:26,196
This coke is out of sight!

530
01:02:26,364 --> 01:02:28,855
Oh, Guzman gets the best, baby.

531
01:02:29,934 --> 01:02:32,164
Oh, you bitch. Don't spill it.

532
01:02:32,603 --> 01:02:34,901
That stuff's worth $900 an ounce.

533
01:02:35,406 --> 01:02:36,839
You better not spill it.

534
01:02:37,875 --> 01:02:39,672
Don't get so uptight.

535
01:02:39,844 --> 01:02:43,746
Nobody says "don't" to me.
You understand? Nobody.

536
01:02:46,517 --> 01:02:48,212
I never touch the stuff.

537
01:02:48,820 --> 01:02:51,015
You want to put that over there now?

538
01:03:16,314 --> 01:03:18,305
Take over for me, will you, Ed?

539
01:03:45,776 --> 01:03:47,971
Damn, I wish something would happen.

540
01:03:48,379 --> 01:03:49,539
Take it easy.

541
01:03:49,947 --> 01:03:52,541
That's what stakeouts are all about.
Waiting.

542
01:05:11,395 --> 01:05:13,056
No, please! No!

543
01:05:19,470 --> 01:05:20,630
Frank!

544
01:06:30,241 --> 01:06:33,335
- Just what the hell is going on?
- Somebody killed a cop.

545
01:06:33,411 --> 01:06:36,437
Folks, there's been a little trouble here.
Everyone stand back.

546
01:06:36,514 --> 01:06:38,448
Please, ma'am, move back.

547
01:06:41,352 --> 01:06:43,252
There's been some trouble.

548
01:06:44,522 --> 01:06:45,580
What happened?

549
01:06:47,024 --> 01:06:49,083
Everything seems to be all right, folks.

550
01:06:49,160 --> 01:06:50,491
What's going on?

551
01:06:53,130 --> 01:06:54,495
Move it, people.

552
01:06:55,633 --> 01:06:57,328
Please, sir, stand back.

553
01:06:57,902 --> 01:06:59,130
Yes, sir.

554
01:07:00,771 --> 01:07:01,795
Yes, sir.

555
01:07:02,807 --> 01:07:05,241
No, sir. We won't let anything
out to the press.

556
01:07:06,744 --> 01:07:07,836
Yes, sir.

557
01:07:08,946 --> 01:07:12,177
You endangered an entire investigation
by trying to push something.

558
01:07:12,249 --> 01:07:14,183
Not to mention your own lives.

559
01:07:14,251 --> 01:07:16,412
You blew the whole Palancio stakeout.

560
01:07:16,487 --> 01:07:19,456
Instead of keeping him under surveillance
as I told you to...

561
01:07:19,857 --> 01:07:22,883
...you had to harass him.
What do you have to say about that?

562
01:07:22,960 --> 01:07:24,552
What do I tell Avery? What?

563
01:07:27,798 --> 01:07:31,461
You tell him it's not Palancio.
You tell him it's a traffic cop.

564
01:07:33,337 --> 01:07:34,395
A cop?

565
01:07:34,472 --> 01:07:35,564
That's right.

566
01:07:35,673 --> 01:07:38,073
A traffic cop. Are you out of your mind?

567
01:07:39,510 --> 01:07:42,411
Do you expect me to believe
that a traffic cop...

568
01:07:42,780 --> 01:07:46,181
...is killing off all the top criminals
in the city? Who?

569
01:07:50,921 --> 01:07:52,252
It's Charlie McCoy.

570
01:07:53,324 --> 01:07:56,725
He's ready for the rubber gun squad.
He even tried to kill himself.

571
01:07:57,194 --> 01:07:58,456
Charlie McCoy.

572
01:08:02,566 --> 01:08:04,898
Guzman was hit today.

573
01:08:06,437 --> 01:08:09,463
A cop was killed. It was Charlie McCoy.

574
01:08:14,078 --> 01:08:15,909
- McCoy?
- Yes, Charlie McCoy.

575
01:08:16,947 --> 01:08:19,848
The only reason I don't bust you
into the bag this minute...

576
01:08:19,917 --> 01:08:22,613
...is I know the two of you
were close friends.

577
01:08:23,287 --> 01:08:26,654
I was just about to call his wife.
Or you can, if you want to.

578
01:08:27,158 --> 01:08:28,420
I know he had kids.

579
01:08:29,527 --> 01:08:30,425
Yeah!

580
01:08:32,363 --> 01:08:34,558
- Who reported it?
- Davis.

581
01:08:34,765 --> 01:08:35,789
Davis?

582
01:08:35,933 --> 01:08:38,424
What happened
to the DiGiorgio stake-out team?

583
01:08:38,602 --> 01:08:42,504
It was an accidental coincidence.
Davis happened to be going by, it happens.

584
01:08:42,573 --> 01:08:44,700
McCoy was already dead
when he got there.

585
01:08:45,576 --> 01:08:46,668
Any witnesses?

586
01:08:46,911 --> 01:08:47,809
None.

587
01:08:51,081 --> 01:08:53,072
- I'll make that call.
- Go ahead.

588
01:08:54,018 --> 01:08:57,715
Harry, if it means anything coming
from me, I'm sorry about Charlie.

589
01:08:58,022 --> 01:08:59,956
But it's Palancio, believe me.

590
01:09:00,491 --> 01:09:03,927
I'll have a warrant in 48 hours.
You can pick him up.

591
01:09:04,061 --> 01:09:05,358
He's all yours.

592
01:09:40,898 --> 01:09:43,025
Well, thank you for coming, Harry.

593
01:09:43,934 --> 01:09:45,731
You sure you have to leave?

594
01:09:47,004 --> 01:09:50,269
I won't have any place to go
for a sit-down dinner anymore.

595
01:09:51,609 --> 01:09:54,100
I never really did like it here very much.

596
01:09:55,546 --> 01:09:57,844
I always liked the change of seasons.

597
01:10:03,687 --> 01:10:06,952
I'm going to take him home. It's time.

598
01:10:08,125 --> 01:10:10,025
It's time he went home.

599
01:10:15,566 --> 01:10:17,761
Come on, kids, let's get in the car.

600
01:10:27,344 --> 01:10:31,041
It was nice of that young man
to help us with the children.

601
01:10:33,817 --> 01:10:36,877
Goodbye, Harry. We'll all miss you.

602
01:10:37,955 --> 01:10:39,047
'Bye, doll.

603
01:10:46,196 --> 01:10:48,790
Take them
to the passenger terminal, please.

604
01:10:58,776 --> 01:11:02,007
It was nice of you to come out.
You didn't have to do that.

605
01:11:02,613 --> 01:11:05,275
If I'd have been there sooner,
he might still be alive.

606
01:11:06,750 --> 01:11:09,048
He didn't deserve to get it that way.

607
01:11:10,654 --> 01:11:12,645
If there's anything I can do...

608
01:11:13,991 --> 01:11:15,925
I feel responsible somehow.

609
01:11:44,888 --> 01:11:47,789
<i>The next shooter is Callahan.</i>
<i>Davis on deck.</i>

610
01:12:29,466 --> 01:12:32,833
You sure shot the pants off
of everybody with that score, Harry.

611
01:12:32,903 --> 01:12:34,803
I've never seen you smoother.

612
01:12:35,339 --> 01:12:37,899
By the way, I personally want to tell you...

613
01:12:37,975 --> 01:12:40,773
...how sorry I am
about what happened to Charlie.

614
01:12:41,945 --> 01:12:46,177
What I can't figure out, Frank,
is how that kid, Davis, got in there first.

615
01:12:46,250 --> 01:12:48,548
You guys were right across the street.

616
01:12:48,852 --> 01:12:53,186
I don't have a goddamned idea, Harry.
The kid came out of nowhere.

617
01:12:54,458 --> 01:12:57,052
We were in that garage
before you could spit.

618
01:12:57,461 --> 01:13:00,862
Maybe I'm slowing down in my old age
or something, I don't know.

619
01:13:01,598 --> 01:13:05,625
I want to be the first to congratulate you
on what I think will be the winning score.

620
01:13:05,703 --> 01:13:07,534
You shaded me by seven points.

621
01:13:07,771 --> 01:13:10,399
The only person now
who has a chance is Davis.

622
01:13:16,146 --> 01:13:17,408
Shoot 'em up!

623
01:13:53,784 --> 01:13:55,513
I think the kid beat you, Harry.

624
01:13:57,855 --> 01:13:58,981
It happens.

625
01:13:59,223 --> 01:14:01,987
<i>Harry, he edged you by four points.</i>

626
01:14:02,392 --> 01:14:04,860
<i>That evens it up on the overall champion.</i>

627
01:14:05,562 --> 01:14:07,553
<i>You have your choice in the shoot-off.</i>

628
01:14:08,198 --> 01:14:10,063
<i>Bull's eye or combat?</i>

629
01:14:13,403 --> 01:14:14,199
Combat.

630
01:14:59,716 --> 01:15:00,683
Out!

631
01:15:09,226 --> 01:15:11,626
<i>5:46 seconds. Score, perfect.</i>

632
01:15:13,297 --> 01:15:14,594
Good luck, sir.

633
01:15:54,705 --> 01:15:55,729
A good guy!

634
01:15:55,873 --> 01:15:57,465
That last one was a good guy!

635
01:16:10,687 --> 01:16:13,918
5:36 seconds.
But I'm sorry, Harry, you hit a good guy.

636
01:16:14,057 --> 01:16:16,423
You had a bad break.
I really don't deserve it.

637
01:16:16,526 --> 01:16:17,754
You won, didn't you?

638
01:16:17,828 --> 01:16:19,819
- I guess, but...
- That's all that matters.

639
01:16:19,897 --> 01:16:21,387
You mind if I try that one?

640
01:16:27,537 --> 01:16:29,630
Chester, how about six?

641
01:16:48,225 --> 01:16:50,750
Not bad. I seem to have lost the last one.

642
01:16:52,062 --> 01:16:53,962
You get used to it.

643
01:16:56,333 --> 01:16:58,358
I can see how you would, at that.

644
01:17:55,325 --> 01:17:58,419
You said five minutes
and I've been waiting for a half an hour.

645
01:17:58,495 --> 01:18:00,224
Don't you ever get hungry?

646
01:18:03,567 --> 01:18:07,162
- It just didn't seem like a half hour.
- Yeah, well it has been.

647
01:18:07,804 --> 01:18:10,898
I went over to my butcher's yesterday
and picked up some veal.

648
01:18:10,974 --> 01:18:15,308
Pops is really an artist, man. I could
watch that man cut meat all day long.

649
01:18:16,680 --> 01:18:18,739
Why don't you come home with me and...

650
01:18:18,815 --> 01:18:21,750
My wife's a good cook.
Have a little dinner with us.

651
01:18:28,091 --> 01:18:31,891
No, thanks. I just saw something
that killed my appetite.

652
01:18:40,234 --> 01:18:44,227
We'll catch those animals with their pants
down. I was going to call you at home.

653
01:18:44,305 --> 01:18:46,830
We got our search warrants
and multiple charges.

654
01:18:46,908 --> 01:18:49,604
We're going to make a city-wide raid
tomorrow morning.

655
01:18:49,677 --> 01:18:53,977
Palancio is yours.
Just don't take him out head-first, Harry.

656
01:18:54,482 --> 01:18:58,111
I think you'll find what I want to show you
in ballistics very interesting.

657
01:18:58,519 --> 01:19:01,886
You'll find more leads than you can
shake a stick at tomorrow morning.

658
01:19:06,460 --> 01:19:08,553
- Good morning, Harry. Sir.
- Walter.

659
01:19:08,629 --> 01:19:10,893
Do you mind excusing us
for a few minutes?

660
01:19:10,965 --> 01:19:11,863
Sure.

661
01:19:21,375 --> 01:19:22,467
There's only two.

662
01:19:22,543 --> 01:19:25,637
- I wonder what happened to the others.
- Federal boys have them.

663
01:19:48,836 --> 01:19:49,530
Well?

664
01:19:50,338 --> 01:19:51,669
Take a look.

665
01:19:56,844 --> 01:19:58,505
Close, real close.

666
01:19:59,647 --> 01:20:02,616
But there's still a lot of lines
that don't match up.

667
01:20:02,850 --> 01:20:05,080
All this proves is that these two bullets...

668
01:20:05,152 --> 01:20:08,610
...came from barrels
with a similar twist and width of rifling.

669
01:20:08,956 --> 01:20:11,220
You don't think it would stand up
as evidence?

670
01:20:11,292 --> 01:20:12,782
As it is, no.

671
01:20:12,893 --> 01:20:15,760
But I'll have a full comparison report made,
no problem.

672
01:20:15,830 --> 01:20:18,993
You're probably right.
Besides, it isn't necessary yet.

673
01:20:19,367 --> 01:20:20,800
What do you mean, "yet"?

674
01:20:21,469 --> 01:20:23,027
Where'd you get that slug?

675
01:20:23,104 --> 01:20:26,835
- I'd just as soon not say for the time being.
- Don't play games on this.

676
01:20:26,941 --> 01:20:28,533
Whose side are you on anyway?

677
01:20:28,609 --> 01:20:31,271
It's just a wild shot
and I'm probably wrong.

678
01:20:31,679 --> 01:20:34,170
I'd like to handle it my own way.

679
01:20:35,116 --> 01:20:38,643
By the way, I'd like to have Davis
and Sweet as my back-up squad tomorrow.

680
01:20:40,121 --> 01:20:41,918
They're just rookies for Christ's sake.

681
01:20:41,989 --> 01:20:45,823
You drum up somebody in the department
who can shoot as well and I'll use them.

682
01:20:45,893 --> 01:20:48,418
Goddamn it,
there isn't supposed to be any shooting.

683
01:20:49,063 --> 01:20:52,157
Besides, they don't have the experience yet
for a job like this.

684
01:20:52,266 --> 01:20:56,225
How the hell's a man supposed to get
experience if nobody gives him a chance?

685
01:20:56,303 --> 01:20:58,328
And Davis is the new pistol champion.

686
01:20:58,606 --> 01:21:00,574
Suppose they panic and start shooting?

687
01:21:02,943 --> 01:21:07,778
Nothing wrong with shooting,
as long as the right people get shot.

688
01:21:24,231 --> 01:21:26,893
- Let him know who you are and keep cool.
- Okay.

689
01:21:27,968 --> 01:21:30,562
I want you to keep an eye
on Davis and Sweet.

690
01:21:30,671 --> 01:21:31,695
What for?

691
01:21:31,939 --> 01:21:33,463
Just do it, will you?

692
01:21:35,309 --> 01:21:36,333
All right.

693
01:21:36,744 --> 01:21:38,678
- You all set?
- All set.

694
01:21:38,746 --> 01:21:40,441
We'll take off in three cars.

695
01:21:40,514 --> 01:21:43,176
Davis and Sweet will make the arrest.
Early will cover.

696
01:21:43,250 --> 01:21:46,583
I'll be on the back at the pier
in case anybody makes a break for it.

697
01:21:46,654 --> 01:21:49,122
If there'll be trouble, that's where it'll start.

698
01:21:49,190 --> 01:21:52,523
We're holding the other squads back
until you've made your arrest.

699
01:21:52,593 --> 01:21:56,654
Yours is the most important, it'll be
the first. We don't want any foul-ups.

700
01:21:57,064 --> 01:21:58,554
- Right?
- Right.

701
01:22:00,568 --> 01:22:04,026
I'd never walk up to a door with Harry,
too many people don't like him.

702
01:22:04,505 --> 01:22:06,996
Thanks. I needed that.

703
01:22:10,611 --> 01:22:12,135
- You boys ready?
- Yes, sir.

704
01:22:12,213 --> 01:22:15,444
- Thank you for requesting us.
- Sir, we won't let you down.

705
01:22:15,516 --> 01:22:17,347
Well, I'm depending on that.

706
01:23:13,307 --> 01:23:14,274
Nickie.

707
01:23:24,952 --> 01:23:25,919
Yeah?

708
01:23:29,290 --> 01:23:30,450
Who is this?

709
01:23:37,364 --> 01:23:38,695
What was that, Nickie?

710
01:23:42,403 --> 01:23:46,134
Somebody said we'll be hit in two minutes.
They'll be dressed like cops.

711
01:23:47,875 --> 01:23:50,036
Did it sound like anybody you know?

712
01:23:50,611 --> 01:23:52,101
No, I couldn't tell.

713
01:24:07,962 --> 01:24:09,691
Ed, Chuck...

714
01:24:12,733 --> 01:24:14,462
...get over to the windows.

715
01:24:18,205 --> 01:24:19,502
I got the water side.

716
01:24:19,573 --> 01:24:21,700
I'll take the street side.

717
01:24:21,942 --> 01:24:24,069
If they are cops, this could be a set-up.

718
01:24:24,144 --> 01:24:27,136
After the holes they put in Ricca
you want me to wait and see?

719
01:24:27,214 --> 01:24:29,205
If they're cops, they'll have papers.

720
01:24:29,283 --> 01:24:30,614
Car coming, Frank.

721
01:24:31,452 --> 01:24:33,352
There's a big guy out there.

722
01:24:37,258 --> 01:24:39,385
- He got a uniform on?
- No.

723
01:24:40,995 --> 01:24:44,294
He ain't no cop.
Cops always come in the front door.

724
01:24:44,798 --> 01:24:45,924
Another car.

725
01:24:46,934 --> 01:24:49,402
Why didn't they come in squad cars
if they're cops?

726
01:24:49,503 --> 01:24:52,370
That big guy's working himself around
by those containers.

727
01:24:54,308 --> 01:24:55,775
He's got a gun out.

728
01:24:56,677 --> 01:24:57,905
Two uniforms in it.

729
01:24:59,246 --> 01:25:00,941
That ain't no cop's gun, Frank.

730
01:25:06,553 --> 01:25:09,249
There's a cop in uniform coming up
to the door.

731
01:25:15,329 --> 01:25:17,854
We aren't open. Come back tomorrow.

732
01:25:18,565 --> 01:25:21,329
Police officers,
we'd like to ask you some questions.

733
01:25:21,402 --> 01:25:23,734
Yeah, I'm just a watchman. Nobody's here.

734
01:25:23,971 --> 01:25:25,905
We're looking for Mr. Frank Palancio.

735
01:25:25,973 --> 01:25:28,806
Would you open the door?
We have a warrant for his arrest.

736
01:25:28,909 --> 01:25:30,706
I said nobody's here, goddamn it!

737
01:25:30,778 --> 01:25:33,042
We have warrants
for a search of the premises.

738
01:25:33,113 --> 01:25:34,011
Serve them!

739
01:25:49,530 --> 01:25:51,998
They got Sweet! Send some help! Quick!

740
01:26:39,880 --> 01:26:41,006
<i>Cease firing.</i>

741
01:26:41,081 --> 01:26:44,482
<i>Throw your weapons out and come out</i>
<i>with your hands behind your heads.</i>

742
01:26:44,551 --> 01:26:46,280
- Bullshit!
- Fuck you!

743
01:28:45,939 --> 01:28:50,069
You sure you don't want a local for this?
Takes about seven stitches.

744
01:28:50,144 --> 01:28:51,270
No, thanks.

745
01:28:53,013 --> 01:28:54,776
Okay, it's your ass.

746
01:28:56,083 --> 01:28:58,108
My head, cut's on my head.

747
01:28:59,786 --> 01:29:02,812
Why does everybody suddenly
become a comedian in here?

748
01:29:03,123 --> 01:29:05,023
Does he have to stay in here?

749
01:29:05,859 --> 01:29:10,091
No, I could stop and let the man's
brains run out all over his shoes.

750
01:29:10,564 --> 01:29:14,056
Rogers, I don't need to have a doctor
display that kind of attitude.

751
01:29:14,134 --> 01:29:15,863
A police officer is dead.

752
01:29:16,803 --> 01:29:17,770
Sorry.

753
01:29:19,506 --> 01:29:22,566
I got those warrants
for a search of the premises, Callahan...

754
01:29:22,643 --> 01:29:25,612
...not for you to become
judge, jury and executioner.

755
01:29:25,712 --> 01:29:27,680
It was supposed to be a simple arrest.

756
01:29:29,016 --> 01:29:32,349
Arresting a killer like Palancio
isn't always simple.

757
01:29:32,553 --> 01:29:34,316
People are guilty until proven...

758
01:29:34,421 --> 01:29:35,251
I mean...

759
01:29:36,657 --> 01:29:38,454
Goddamn it, you know what I mean.

760
01:29:38,892 --> 01:29:41,952
The city's on the edge
of the worst violence in its history...

761
01:29:42,029 --> 01:29:44,759
...and you have to start
full-scale military operations.

762
01:29:44,831 --> 01:29:48,289
I didn't start shooting at anyone
who didn't start shooting at me first.

763
01:29:48,368 --> 01:29:52,634
Each time you pull out that gun,
my paperwork backs up for three months.

764
01:29:53,006 --> 01:29:55,770
The chief and I have already
conferred on this matter.

765
01:29:55,842 --> 01:29:58,140
A full investigation is warranted here.

766
01:30:03,283 --> 01:30:04,910
What about a dead cop?

767
01:30:06,186 --> 01:30:09,883
- I warned you against taking them.
- Sweet was killed with the first shot.

768
01:30:10,157 --> 01:30:14,059
Besides they were tipped off.
They knew we were coming, Briggs.

769
01:30:14,394 --> 01:30:16,726
How? Don't hand me that crap.

770
01:30:17,397 --> 01:30:20,798
They knew we were coming.
After 200 arrests, I know the difference.

771
01:30:22,436 --> 01:30:26,429
If I have my way, Callahan, you won't make
another arrest as long as you live.

772
01:30:28,742 --> 01:30:30,175
Is that all, Lieutenant?

773
01:30:31,078 --> 01:30:32,978
No, that's not all.

774
01:30:34,514 --> 01:30:36,209
I want that slug you showed me.

775
01:30:38,352 --> 01:30:42,254
I ran that through ballistics, it was nothing.
The rifling was totally different.

776
01:30:42,322 --> 01:30:44,950
It's still State's evidence.
I want it anyway.

777
01:30:49,963 --> 01:30:50,952
Eat it.

778
01:31:13,153 --> 01:31:18,181
Look, Harry, if it means anything,
I think you got the wrong end of the stick.

779
01:31:18,258 --> 01:31:19,987
- You do?
- Yeah.

780
01:31:20,160 --> 01:31:22,321
What did they find when they got in there?

781
01:31:22,462 --> 01:31:25,920
Nothing. Palancio was as clean
as he could possibly be.

782
01:31:26,633 --> 01:31:28,726
They knew we were coming, Harry.

783
01:31:28,969 --> 01:31:31,233
Why do you figure they opened up on us?

784
01:31:31,672 --> 01:31:34,607
They must've thought
it was a set-up like the others.

785
01:31:35,008 --> 01:31:36,999
- It was.
- No.

786
01:31:38,378 --> 01:31:40,005
It was a set-up, Early.

787
01:31:41,682 --> 01:31:46,051
What I'll lay on you seems so far-fetched,
I can't even believe it myself.

788
01:31:47,054 --> 01:31:50,285
I gave up being surprised
working with you anyway.

789
01:31:51,191 --> 01:31:53,455
Would you be surprised if I told you...

790
01:31:53,527 --> 01:31:57,520
...a bunch of rookie cops were the ones
who were doing all the killing?

791
01:31:58,832 --> 01:31:59,799
See this?

792
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:02,730
I gave Briggs a phony for the time being.

793
01:32:03,370 --> 01:32:05,804
This is a bullet I took out
of the target range.

794
01:32:05,872 --> 01:32:07,840
It came from Davis' gun.

795
01:32:08,008 --> 01:32:11,375
It matches up with the one
taken out of Charlie McCoy's body.

796
01:32:11,945 --> 01:32:13,845
Davis? That's insane.

797
01:32:14,314 --> 01:32:17,772
Maybe so, but somebody tipped-off
Palancio that we were coming.

798
01:32:17,984 --> 01:32:21,943
Wanting me killed or Palancio
or hopefully both.

799
01:32:22,456 --> 01:32:25,823
Yeah, but Sweet died today.

800
01:32:26,293 --> 01:32:28,090
Sweet was sacrificed.

801
01:32:29,496 --> 01:32:32,522
What's more important if I'm right,
I'll be sacrificed.

802
01:32:32,599 --> 01:32:36,160
They've gotta figure I told you,
which means you'll be sacrificed.

803
01:32:38,905 --> 01:32:40,065
Yeah.

804
01:32:41,508 --> 01:32:45,638
If anything happens to me,
I want you to give that to Lt. Briggs.

805
01:32:45,712 --> 01:32:46,736
Okay.

806
01:32:46,813 --> 01:32:48,678
What happens if they get us both?

807
01:32:49,349 --> 01:32:50,373
Then they win.

808
01:32:53,320 --> 01:32:57,086
It's not hard to understand
how this could happen, the way things are.

809
01:32:57,224 --> 01:33:01,285
As incredible as it seems, there may be
a sub-organization within the police force.

810
01:33:01,361 --> 01:33:05,127
Sort of a death squad
like they had in Brazil some years back.

811
01:33:06,333 --> 01:33:07,265
Damn.

812
01:33:09,102 --> 01:33:13,505
Some nights I wake up, wonder
where the hell the world's going to.

813
01:33:16,810 --> 01:33:19,335
I want you to take care of yourself,
you understand?

814
01:33:52,045 --> 01:33:52,875
Hi!

815
01:33:53,280 --> 01:33:54,304
Hi.

816
01:33:55,115 --> 01:33:57,015
Jesus, what happened to your face?

817
01:33:57,617 --> 01:33:59,551
Nothing, just a few stitches.

818
01:34:01,521 --> 01:34:05,082
I was going to the market,
how about if I bring back a few beers?

819
01:34:05,492 --> 01:34:07,960
Good, I could use a beer right about now.

820
01:34:08,094 --> 01:34:10,426
I've got your key, so I'll get your mail, too.

821
01:34:10,564 --> 01:34:11,724
All right, baby.

822
01:34:12,232 --> 01:34:13,460
Keep it warm.

823
01:34:38,658 --> 01:34:41,718
Do you have any idea how hard it is
to prosecute a cop?

824
01:34:59,913 --> 01:35:02,677
You heroes have killed
a dozen people this week.

825
01:35:04,451 --> 01:35:06,442
What are you gonna do next week?

826
01:35:09,289 --> 01:35:10,756
Kill a dozen more.

827
01:35:12,225 --> 01:35:14,716
Is that what you guys are all about,
being heroes?

828
01:35:15,095 --> 01:35:16,528
All our heroes are dead.

829
01:35:16,963 --> 01:35:18,794
We are the first generation...

830
01:35:19,165 --> 01:35:20,962
...that's learned to fight.

831
01:35:21,568 --> 01:35:24,696
We're simply ridding society
of killers that would be caught...

832
01:35:24,771 --> 01:35:27,831
...and sentenced anyway
if our courts worked properly.

833
01:35:29,509 --> 01:35:32,945
We began with the criminals
that the people know...

834
01:35:34,548 --> 01:35:37,244
...so that our actions would be understood.

835
01:35:38,485 --> 01:35:42,182
It's not just a question
of whether or not to use violence.

836
01:35:43,957 --> 01:35:46,357
There simply is no other way, Inspector.

837
01:35:47,694 --> 01:35:49,184
You of all people...

838
01:35:50,063 --> 01:35:51,792
...should understand that.

839
01:35:54,935 --> 01:35:57,426
Either you're for us or you're against us.

840
01:36:03,910 --> 01:36:05,901
I'm afraid you've misjudged me.

841
01:38:09,135 --> 01:38:10,625
- Hi, Sunny.
- Hi, Sue.

842
01:38:17,911 --> 01:38:19,105
No, no!

843
01:38:20,380 --> 01:38:22,712
Harry, what are you doing?

844
01:38:29,789 --> 01:38:31,689
Hey, what's going on down here?

845
01:38:32,058 --> 01:38:34,720
I'm taking the mailbox apart,
what does it look like?

846
01:38:34,794 --> 01:38:37,160
- You people live here, don't you?
- Yeah.

847
01:38:38,031 --> 01:38:41,023
What are you doing to the mailbox?
Did you lose you key?

848
01:38:41,101 --> 01:38:43,501
Why don't you mind
your own goddamn business.

849
01:38:44,437 --> 01:38:47,565
That's my mailbox, too.
Don't you get smart with me!

850
01:38:48,942 --> 01:38:51,240
Tampering with the mail
is a federal offense.

851
01:38:51,511 --> 01:38:53,138
I'm calling the police.

852
01:38:54,047 --> 01:38:55,275
I am the police.

853
01:38:56,916 --> 01:38:57,814
What?

854
01:39:00,086 --> 01:39:01,610
The cop that lives upstairs?

855
01:39:20,540 --> 01:39:21,507
What's that?

856
01:39:23,576 --> 01:39:24,975
Plastic explosive.

857
01:39:27,180 --> 01:39:28,204
A bomb?

858
01:39:28,782 --> 01:39:29,771
That's right.

859
01:39:29,849 --> 01:39:33,114
If you'd bothered me any more,
we'd all be stuck to the ceiling.

860
01:39:33,186 --> 01:39:36,349
- Do you want to hold it?
- No. I don't want to get involved.

861
01:39:39,325 --> 01:39:42,317
Go to your apartment and stay there.
Don't open for anybody.

862
01:41:13,853 --> 01:41:17,220
Homicide, Lt. Briggs,
Inspector Callahan calling.

863
01:41:20,159 --> 01:41:22,024
Callahan, where are you?

864
01:41:22,395 --> 01:41:24,886
Look, Briggs,
I just found a bomb in my mailbox.

865
01:41:24,964 --> 01:41:27,762
I want you to get a man
over to Early's house right away.

866
01:41:28,134 --> 01:41:28,930
What?

867
01:41:29,002 --> 01:41:30,970
I've got a bomb right here!

868
01:41:31,104 --> 01:41:33,265
Now get a man over to Early's,
you hear me?

869
01:41:34,007 --> 01:41:35,031
Right.

870
01:41:35,909 --> 01:41:38,571
Stay right where you are.
I'll be down there myself.

871
01:41:38,645 --> 01:41:39,737
Don't move.

872
01:42:22,755 --> 01:42:23,744
Yeah?

873
01:42:33,166 --> 01:42:34,292
Come on in.

874
01:42:37,136 --> 01:42:39,161
I don't like looking down one of those.

875
01:42:42,608 --> 01:42:43,973
Where's the bomb?

876
01:42:44,944 --> 01:42:46,468
Right on the dresser.

877
01:42:49,215 --> 01:42:52,878
All right. Let's get out of here.

878
01:42:53,886 --> 01:42:55,615
Avery will want to see this.

879
01:43:06,366 --> 01:43:09,529
You mind driving?
I want to take a closer look at this thing.

880
01:43:31,891 --> 01:43:34,758
This thing could be activated
by your mailbox key.

881
01:43:36,095 --> 01:43:37,357
Or by a timer.

882
01:43:41,100 --> 01:43:42,465
Turn right, here.

883
01:43:47,240 --> 01:43:48,707
Get on the freeway.

884
01:43:49,909 --> 01:43:51,137
The freeway?

885
01:43:52,278 --> 01:43:54,644
You got a new route to city hall,
Lieutenant?

886
01:44:02,622 --> 01:44:06,217
Your gun's out of its holster, Briggs.
First time?

887
01:44:06,459 --> 01:44:08,620
You know you're not going to city hall.

888
01:44:08,694 --> 01:44:11,754
The only way you're going anywhere
is in a rubber bag.

889
01:44:12,498 --> 01:44:13,760
Let me have your gun.

890
01:44:33,686 --> 01:44:34,983
Now the shells.

891
01:44:39,325 --> 01:44:41,919
Three. You always carry three.

892
01:44:47,300 --> 01:44:49,029
Throw them out the window.

893
01:44:55,174 --> 01:44:57,768
How do you figure on pulling this off,
Briggs?

894
01:44:57,844 --> 01:45:01,610
I run the investigation, with your record,
I can make anything stick.

895
01:45:02,849 --> 01:45:05,511
What I can't understand is,
why you of all people?

896
01:45:05,651 --> 01:45:08,586
A hundred years ago in this city,
people did the same thing.

897
01:45:08,654 --> 01:45:11,623
History justified the vigilantes,
we're no different.

898
01:45:12,058 --> 01:45:15,619
Anyone who threatens the security
of the people will be executed.

899
01:45:16,129 --> 01:45:20,498
- Evil for evil, Harry. Retribution.
- That's just fine.

900
01:45:21,300 --> 01:45:23,097
But how does murder fit in?

901
01:45:23,769 --> 01:45:26,431
When police start becoming
their own executioners...

902
01:45:26,506 --> 01:45:28,599
...where's it gonna end, Briggs?

903
01:45:29,275 --> 01:45:32,267
Pretty soon, you'll start executing people
for jaywalking.

904
01:45:32,345 --> 01:45:34,939
And executing people for traffic violations.

905
01:45:35,314 --> 01:45:39,375
Then you end up executing your neighbor
'cause his dog pisses on your lawn.

906
01:45:39,986 --> 01:45:43,649
There isn't one man we've killed that
didn't deserve what was coming to him.

907
01:45:43,723 --> 01:45:46,021
Yes, there is. Charlie McCoy.

908
01:45:46,459 --> 01:45:47,983
What would you have done?

909
01:45:48,060 --> 01:45:49,584
I'd have upheld the law.

910
01:45:49,662 --> 01:45:51,994
What the hell do you know about the law?

911
01:45:52,064 --> 01:45:53,793
You're a great cop, Harry.

912
01:45:54,033 --> 01:45:57,525
You had a chance to join the team,
but you'd rather stick to the system.

913
01:45:57,603 --> 01:46:01,164
Briggs, I hate the goddamn system.
But until someone comes along...

914
01:46:01,240 --> 01:46:04,038
...with some changes that make sense,
I'll stick with it.

915
01:46:04,710 --> 01:46:06,701
You're about to become extinct.

916
01:46:11,350 --> 01:46:13,079
Get off at the next exit.

917
01:55:18,063 --> 01:55:18,927
Red?

918
01:55:49,828 --> 01:55:50,692
Red?

919
01:58:10,369 --> 01:58:14,169
Briggs was right.
You guys don't have enough experience.

920
01:58:54,980 --> 01:58:57,141
Just hold it right there, Callahan.

921
01:58:58,951 --> 01:59:00,043
No tricks.

922
01:59:11,997 --> 01:59:13,931
Your organization's through, Briggs.

923
01:59:15,500 --> 01:59:18,298
There's a lot more where they came from,
believe me.

924
01:59:18,437 --> 01:59:21,736
Move out of the way. Move it!

925
01:59:49,735 --> 01:59:51,032
Uphold the law.

926
01:59:53,705 --> 01:59:56,697
You just killed three police officers, Harry.

927
02:00:01,113 --> 02:00:03,707
And the only reason
I'm not gonna kill you...

928
02:00:04,249 --> 02:00:07,309
...is because I'm gonna prosecute you
with your own system.

929
02:00:15,560 --> 02:00:17,551
It'll be my word against yours.

930
02:00:19,131 --> 02:00:20,962
And who's gonna believe you?

931
02:00:21,933 --> 02:00:25,198
You're a killer, Harry. A maniac!
