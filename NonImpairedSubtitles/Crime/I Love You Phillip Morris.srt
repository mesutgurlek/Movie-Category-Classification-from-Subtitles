1
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:20,118
Love sure is a funny thing.

2
00:01:20,118 --> 00:01:22,996
Makes you happy. Makes you sad.

3
00:01:22,996 --> 00:01:24,914
Makes you do all sorts of things...

4
00:01:24,914 --> 00:01:25,873
you never thought you'd do before.

5
00:01:26,832 --> 00:01:28,751
ln fact, love's the reason...

6
00:01:28,751 --> 00:01:30,669
l'm laying here dying.

7
00:01:31,626 --> 00:01:33,545
-Uh-huh.
-No, there's not.

8
00:01:33,545 --> 00:01:36,422
-Oh, l see it, there it is!
-Told ya.

9
00:01:36,422 --> 00:01:39,300
-l don't see it.
-lt's right there.

10
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:41,218
Steven!

11
00:01:41,218 --> 00:01:43,136
-l still don't see it.
-Steven!

12
00:01:43,136 --> 00:01:45,055
Come on, honey.

13
00:01:53,686 --> 00:01:54,646
Now, Steven.

14
00:01:54,646 --> 00:01:56,563
We wanna tell you
something very important,

15
00:01:56,563 --> 00:01:59,441
but l want you to know
that it doesn't change a thing.

16
00:01:59,441 --> 00:02:01,359
We're still gonna love you.

17
00:02:01,359 --> 00:02:04,236
-You're still--
-You're adopted.

18
00:02:07,113 --> 00:02:09,032
-lt's true.
-Ow.

19
00:02:09,990 --> 00:02:11,908
You're a very special little boy.

20
00:02:11,908 --> 00:02:12,868
But do you know why?

21
00:02:14,786 --> 00:02:15,746
Because we chose you.

22
00:02:16,704 --> 00:02:17,664
Your mother's right, son.

23
00:02:18,623 --> 00:02:19,582
lt's because we love you.

24
00:02:19,582 --> 00:02:23,418
We put some money in a paper bag...

25
00:02:23,418 --> 00:02:26,294
and gave it to your real mommy
in the hospital parking lot...

26
00:02:27,254 --> 00:02:30,131
so you could come home with us,
okay?

27
00:02:31,090 --> 00:02:32,050
lt hurt a bit.

28
00:02:33,008 --> 00:02:34,927
But l decided l wasn't
gonna let that get me down.

29
00:02:35,886 --> 00:02:36,845
Let's go, people, let's go!

30
00:02:36,845 --> 00:02:37,804
No way.

31
00:02:37,804 --> 00:02:38,763
Where's the crash cart?

32
00:02:38,763 --> 00:02:44,518
l decided l would be the best son,
no, the best person l could be.

33
00:02:49,313 --> 00:02:51,231
lN THE RESURRECTlON MORNlNG...

34
00:02:51,231 --> 00:02:53,149
WHEN THE TRUMP OF
GOD SHALL SOUND...

35
00:02:53,149 --> 00:02:57,945
WE SHALL RlSE, WE SHALL RlSE.

36
00:02:57,945 --> 00:02:59,863
WE SHALL RlSE, HALLELUJAH.

37
00:02:59,863 --> 00:03:02,740
WE SHALL RlSE, AMEN. WE SHALL...

38
00:03:02,740 --> 00:03:04,658
RlSE HALLELUJAH...

39
00:03:04,658 --> 00:03:06,576
ON THE RESURRECTlON MORNlNG.

40
00:03:06,576 --> 00:03:08,495
WHEN DEATH'S PRlSON
BARS ARE BROKEN...

41
00:03:08,495 --> 00:03:13,289
WE SHALL RlSE, WE SHALL RlSE.

42
00:03:14,249 --> 00:03:15,208
-Morning, Steven.
-Bill.

43
00:03:15,208 --> 00:03:17,126
-You got somethin'.
-Thanks, darlin'.

44
00:03:20,004 --> 00:03:20,962
-Hey, Steven.
-Hey, guys.

45
00:03:20,962 --> 00:03:22,880
-How's it hangin'?
-Oh, to the left.

46
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:24,799
Ho, gunslinger. Look out.

47
00:03:29,595 --> 00:03:29,595
-Smitty.
-Hey, Steve.

48
00:03:29,595 --> 00:03:31,513
-Weiss.
-Hey, Steven.

49
00:03:41,103 --> 00:03:43,021
And you've got a chocolate bar
and a piece of cake.

50
00:03:43,021 --> 00:03:44,940
You got a loose tooth.

51
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:46,858
That's 2 that's coming in, isn't it?

52
00:03:46,858 --> 00:03:47,817
l brushed my gums.

53
00:03:48,777 --> 00:03:50,695
l got your nose. Look at that.

54
00:03:50,695 --> 00:03:51,653
That's your finger.

55
00:03:52,613 --> 00:03:53,572
No, it's not. lt's your nose.

56
00:03:53,572 --> 00:03:54,531
l can smell you.

57
00:03:55,490 --> 00:03:56,449
You smell really good.

58
00:03:58,367 --> 00:04:00,286
You have lots of dreams, okay?

59
00:04:03,162 --> 00:04:04,121
Okay.

60
00:04:05,081 --> 00:04:06,039
-Good night.
-Good night.

61
00:04:06,999 --> 00:04:08,917
-Good night.
-Good night.

62
00:04:12,753 --> 00:04:14,672
-Good night.
-Good night.

63
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:16,590
Good night.

64
00:04:17,548 --> 00:04:18,508
Good night.

65
00:04:19,467 --> 00:04:20,426
Good night.

66
00:04:21,385 --> 00:04:22,344
And if it wasn't for you, Jesus...

67
00:04:22,344 --> 00:04:25,222
l would have never found that
last coffee filter.

68
00:04:25,222 --> 00:04:27,140
And Prayer Girls would
have been ruined for sure.

69
00:04:27,140 --> 00:04:30,016
-So, thank you for that.
-Amen.

70
00:04:30,016 --> 00:04:32,894
And for Stephie's allergy screen
coming back all negative.

71
00:04:33,853 --> 00:04:35,771
That would have been a nightmare.

72
00:04:35,771 --> 00:04:39,607
l know that it was in your plan
for her to enjoy nuts in her life...

73
00:04:39,607 --> 00:04:42,485
and not end up like little Wendy
who blew up like a balloon and...

74
00:04:42,485 --> 00:04:45,363
they had to cut a hole in her throat
so that she could breathe.

75
00:04:47,281 --> 00:04:48,239
And, finally...

76
00:04:48,239 --> 00:04:51,117
l would like to thank you for
this man, Jesus.

77
00:04:51,117 --> 00:04:56,871
This man who works so hard
to make us happy,

78
00:04:56,871 --> 00:05:00,707
This man who pursued me
to the ends of the Earth...

79
00:05:00,707 --> 00:05:03,585
and promised me a life
of eternal happiness.

80
00:05:03,585 --> 00:05:04,544
And he's kept that promise,

81
00:05:04,544 --> 00:05:05,503
oh, Lord, he has.

82
00:05:05,503 --> 00:05:09,340
-Every day. Amen.
-Amen.

83
00:05:09,340 --> 00:05:12,216
lt's just sometimes l wanna cry
when l think about how happy l am.

84
00:05:12,216 --> 00:05:14,135
lt's like the time you were there--.

85
00:05:17,012 --> 00:05:20,848
Deb, you know how as a cop
l have access to records and things?

86
00:05:21,807 --> 00:05:22,766
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

87
00:05:23,726 --> 00:05:26,602
Do you think it would be unethical
for me to use that to find my mother?

88
00:05:27,562 --> 00:05:28,520
What?

89
00:05:31,398 --> 00:05:33,316
l think that's probably something
that you need to think about.

90
00:05:34,275 --> 00:05:35,235
And maybe at another time?

91
00:05:36,194 --> 00:05:37,153
Right. l shouldn't have done it.

92
00:05:38,112 --> 00:05:41,949
You did it? What'd you find?

93
00:05:41,949 --> 00:05:43,867
l haven't looked. lt's downstairs.

94
00:05:44,825 --> 00:05:47,702
Steven! Oh, my God. Let's go look!

95
00:05:47,702 --> 00:05:48,661
-Oh, wait, hold on.
-What?

96
00:05:48,661 --> 00:05:49,621
Let me finish.

97
00:05:52,497 --> 00:05:53,457
lt's chicken scratch, mostly.

98
00:05:53,457 --> 00:05:57,293
-Ooh, what's that?
-She's right here.

99
00:05:59,212 --> 00:06:00,171
She's been here the whole time.

100
00:06:01,130 --> 00:06:04,008
-ls that her?
-Without question.

101
00:06:04,966 --> 00:06:06,884
Well, that's wonderful.

102
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:12,639
You want me to make some cookies?
l'm gonna make some cookies.

103
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:15,516
Let's make some cookies.
You wanna make some cookies?

104
00:06:16,475 --> 00:06:17,434
No cookies?

105
00:06:18,393 --> 00:06:19,352
He's in Defib!

106
00:06:19,352 --> 00:06:20,312
Where is the fucking crash cart?

107
00:06:21,270 --> 00:06:23,188
And one. And two. And three.

108
00:06:23,188 --> 00:06:25,107
Charge to two hundred.

109
00:06:25,107 --> 00:06:27,025
And one. And two.

110
00:06:27,025 --> 00:06:27,984
Clear.

111
00:06:27,984 --> 00:06:29,903
Recharge 300.

112
00:06:29,903 --> 00:06:34,699
Truth be told, the reason l became
a cop was to find my real mother.

113
00:06:34,699 --> 00:06:36,616
Maybe it wasn't the right thing to do.

114
00:06:37,574 --> 00:06:39,493
Maybe it wasn't the moral thing to do.

115
00:06:39,493 --> 00:06:42,370
But, hell. l just wasn't hearing it.

116
00:06:44,289 --> 00:06:45,247
Look at that.

117
00:06:56,757 --> 00:06:58,675
ls something wrong, Officer?

118
00:06:59,634 --> 00:07:00,593
Are you Barbara Bascombe?

119
00:07:01,551 --> 00:07:03,469
Yes. ls something wrong?

120
00:07:06,347 --> 00:07:09,225
You gave a baby up for adoption,
correct?

121
00:07:11,143 --> 00:07:14,020
l don't think l know
what you're talking about.

122
00:07:14,020 --> 00:07:14,980
Okay.

123
00:07:16,898 --> 00:07:17,856
You were young.

124
00:07:17,856 --> 00:07:19,775
You made a mistake giving me away.

125
00:07:19,775 --> 00:07:21,693
Mom, please, let me finish.

126
00:07:21,693 --> 00:07:22,652
We all make mistakes.

127
00:07:22,652 --> 00:07:24,571
l came here to say l forgive you.

128
00:07:25,530 --> 00:07:26,488
Because none of us is perfect.

129
00:07:26,488 --> 00:07:28,406
With a fresh start, we can build.

130
00:07:29,366 --> 00:07:32,242
l have no idea
what you're talking about, Steven.

131
00:07:32,242 --> 00:07:34,161
Just tell me why!

132
00:07:34,161 --> 00:07:35,120
Go away!

133
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:38,957
Okay, okay, l understand.
lt's a lot at once.

134
00:07:39,915 --> 00:07:40,875
l'll come back, how's that?

135
00:07:41,833 --> 00:07:42,793
l'll come back later.

136
00:07:42,793 --> 00:07:43,752
l'll bring us some coffee...

137
00:07:43,752 --> 00:07:45,671
and we can talk about
why you abandoned me...

138
00:07:45,671 --> 00:07:47,589
and kept your other two children!

139
00:07:48,547 --> 00:07:50,466
l was the middle child.

140
00:07:50,466 --> 00:07:52,383
What was wrong with me?

141
00:07:53,342 --> 00:07:54,301
What was wrong with me?

142
00:07:55,261 --> 00:07:57,179
What was wrong--.

143
00:07:57,179 --> 00:07:59,097
Oh, shit. l broke your screen.

144
00:07:59,097 --> 00:08:01,015
l'm so sor--. l broke your screen.

145
00:08:01,015 --> 00:08:02,933
Oh, fuck it.

146
00:08:02,933 --> 00:08:06,770
You know what?
l'm gonna take this mat.

147
00:08:06,770 --> 00:08:07,729
'Cause it's a lie.

148
00:08:10,606 --> 00:08:15,402
HAPPY BlRTHDAY TO YOU.

149
00:08:15,402 --> 00:08:16,360
l'm goin'.

150
00:08:17,319 --> 00:08:19,238
l quit the force that day.

151
00:08:20,196 --> 00:08:23,074
l packed up my family
and l moved to Texas.

152
00:08:24,034 --> 00:08:25,952
Take these in the kitchen.

153
00:08:28,828 --> 00:08:30,747
Steven? Hi. Come on up.

154
00:08:31,706 --> 00:08:32,665
You haven't met
our new neighbors yet.

155
00:08:33,624 --> 00:08:35,543
Across the street and down two.
Neil and Sara.

156
00:08:35,543 --> 00:08:36,501
No, l haven't.

157
00:08:36,501 --> 00:08:38,420
l hope you're changing the paint.

158
00:08:38,420 --> 00:08:39,379
What do you call that color?

159
00:08:39,379 --> 00:08:41,297
No, we're changing it.

160
00:08:41,297 --> 00:08:42,256
Good, good, good.

161
00:08:42,256 --> 00:08:45,133
Debbie tells me you used to be
on the police force back in Georgia.

162
00:08:45,133 --> 00:08:46,092
Virginia Beach.

163
00:08:46,092 --> 00:08:48,010
l kinda lost interest, you know.

164
00:08:48,010 --> 00:08:49,929
Went back into the family business.

165
00:08:49,929 --> 00:08:50,887
What's that?

166
00:08:50,887 --> 00:08:52,805
Produce. l work for Cisco.

167
00:08:52,805 --> 00:08:54,724
Always fresh, never frozen.

168
00:08:54,724 --> 00:08:56,642
lt's got great benefits, too.

169
00:08:57,601 --> 00:08:58,561
Yeah, and the hours don't crush me.

170
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:00,479
Plenty of home time.

171
00:09:00,479 --> 00:09:03,356
Yeah, now l can keep my eye on him.

172
00:09:03,356 --> 00:09:04,316
Among other things.

173
00:09:04,316 --> 00:09:05,274
No.

174
00:09:06,234 --> 00:09:07,191
Watch out.

175
00:09:25,415 --> 00:09:29,251
l'm gonna come. l'm gonna come!

176
00:09:30,211 --> 00:09:33,086
Do it, man. Come in my ass.

177
00:09:34,046 --> 00:09:35,964
Did l forget to mention l'm gay?

178
00:09:36,924 --> 00:09:41,719
Yep. l'm gay.
Gay, gay, gay, gay, gay.

179
00:09:41,719 --> 00:09:43,637
Have been as long as l remember.

180
00:09:44,597 --> 00:09:47,473
Hey, look up. l see a pony.

181
00:09:47,473 --> 00:09:48,433
What do you see?

182
00:09:48,433 --> 00:09:50,351
l see a diesel train.

183
00:09:50,351 --> 00:09:51,310
l see a whirly-bird.

184
00:09:51,310 --> 00:09:53,229
l see a wiener.

185
00:09:54,188 --> 00:09:56,106
What? What kinda wiener?

186
00:09:58,982 --> 00:10:01,859
Shut up. There's no wiener.

187
00:10:01,859 --> 00:10:02,819
Uh-huh.

188
00:10:02,819 --> 00:10:03,777
No, there's not.

189
00:10:04,737 --> 00:10:06,655
Oh, l see it. There it is.

190
00:10:07,614 --> 00:10:08,573
l still don't see it.

191
00:10:09,532 --> 00:10:11,451
Now, where was l? Oh, yeah.

192
00:10:11,451 --> 00:10:14,328
Do it, man. Come in my ass.

193
00:10:14,328 --> 00:10:16,246
And l did.

194
00:10:21,042 --> 00:10:23,918
l have been living a lie
for a long, long time.

195
00:10:25,836 --> 00:10:27,754
l tend to do that. Hide things.

196
00:10:28,714 --> 00:10:31,592
So l told Debbie l had
clients to entertain or...

197
00:10:32,550 --> 00:10:35,428
l was working late, just little lies.

198
00:10:36,387 --> 00:10:38,305
Sometimes you have to shave
a little off the puzzle piece...

199
00:10:38,305 --> 00:10:39,265
just to make it fit.

200
00:10:40,223 --> 00:10:45,019
But of course life has a way of
forcing these things into the light.

201
00:10:50,773 --> 00:10:53,650
You might even call it an epiphany.

202
00:10:59,405 --> 00:11:01,323
l haven't lived my life.

203
00:11:02,282 --> 00:11:05,160
-Try not to speak, sir.
-Fuck you.

204
00:11:06,119 --> 00:11:08,037
No one's gonna tell me
what to do anymore.

205
00:11:08,996 --> 00:11:09,956
No more lies.

206
00:11:10,914 --> 00:11:13,791
l'm gonna live my life my way.

207
00:11:14,750 --> 00:11:16,668
Be the real me.

208
00:11:17,627 --> 00:11:22,422
Buy what l want do what l want,
fuck who l want.

209
00:11:22,422 --> 00:11:24,341
My way.

210
00:11:24,341 --> 00:11:26,260
Okay, sir. Whatever you say.

211
00:11:26,260 --> 00:11:27,218
-l'm gonna be a fag.
-Okay.

212
00:11:28,178 --> 00:11:30,096
-A big fag.
-All right.

213
00:11:30,096 --> 00:11:33,932
You hear me?
l'm gonna be a fag.

214
00:11:36,809 --> 00:11:37,769
Faggot!

215
00:11:37,769 --> 00:11:40,645
That's what they're gonna call me.

216
00:11:40,645 --> 00:11:41,604
Yep, just like that...

217
00:11:42,563 --> 00:11:45,441
l decided to start my life over
and live it like the real me.

218
00:11:49,277 --> 00:11:52,155
Of course it was a delicate situation.

219
00:11:52,155 --> 00:11:54,073
So l'd have to find the right way
to break it to Debbie.

220
00:11:55,032 --> 00:11:55,991
You're what?

221
00:11:56,950 --> 00:11:57,909
l'm gay!

222
00:12:05,581 --> 00:12:07,499
Life was good.

223
00:12:07,499 --> 00:12:10,377
l moved to Florida
got two adorable pups...

224
00:12:10,377 --> 00:12:12,295
and a boyfriend named Jimmy.

225
00:12:13,254 --> 00:12:16,132
l swear. l bought anything
that caught my eye.

226
00:12:16,132 --> 00:12:19,009
Clothes jewelry,
you name it l snatched it up.

227
00:12:19,968 --> 00:12:22,846
l was the guy everyone called to
find out where the new hotspots

228
00:12:22,846 --> 00:12:25,723
were clubs, bars, restaurants.

229
00:12:25,723 --> 00:12:26,682
l knew them all.

230
00:12:27,641 --> 00:12:30,518
And sometimes l'd even stay at hotels
on the weekend because...

231
00:12:30,518 --> 00:12:32,436
l heard they had great bathrooms.

232
00:12:32,436 --> 00:12:35,313
Or room service. Or really hot bellboys.

233
00:12:36,272 --> 00:12:38,190
But it didn't take me
long to realize something

234
00:12:38,190 --> 00:12:40,109
that never occurred to me before.

235
00:12:41,068 --> 00:12:42,986
Actually, no one ever really
talks about this, but...

236
00:12:44,905 --> 00:12:45,863
Cash or charge?

237
00:12:45,863 --> 00:12:48,741
being gay is really expensive.

238
00:12:48,741 --> 00:12:49,700
Charge.

239
00:12:51,618 --> 00:12:53,536
but it was nowhere
near good enough...

240
00:12:53,536 --> 00:12:56,413
for living as high on the gay hog
as l wanted to.

241
00:12:56,413 --> 00:12:57,372
-US-1 , right?
-Finest in the land.

242
00:12:58,331 --> 00:13:01,209
For a guy with
no college education...

243
00:13:03,127 --> 00:13:04,085
my options were...

244
00:13:06,004 --> 00:13:06,004
limited.

245
00:13:08,881 --> 00:13:09,840
Oh, my back!

246
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:13,677
Oh, l can't believe
l slipped on virgin oil.

247
00:13:13,677 --> 00:13:16,554
Ah, don't touch me.
Oh, no, don't tou--. Oh.

248
00:13:17,514 --> 00:13:18,472
So, l had no choice.

249
00:13:21,349 --> 00:13:22,308
l became a conman.

250
00:13:22,308 --> 00:13:23,267
Your check.

251
00:13:24,226 --> 00:13:28,062
Yep. lnsurance fraud
credit card fraud, passport fraud.

252
00:13:28,062 --> 00:13:29,981
l was selling bad tomatoes.

253
00:13:29,981 --> 00:13:31,899
Anything to make a buck.

254
00:13:32,858 --> 00:13:34,777
-And best of all.
-There you go.

255
00:13:34,777 --> 00:13:35,736
No one got hurt.

256
00:13:36,695 --> 00:13:37,654
Thank you, Mr. Evans...

257
00:13:38,613 --> 00:13:39,573
can l see some l.D., please?

258
00:13:39,573 --> 00:13:40,531
Of course you can.

259
00:13:49,162 --> 00:13:52,040
What do you think? Yes?

260
00:13:53,958 --> 00:13:55,877
Well, Steven, it's beautiful.

261
00:13:55,877 --> 00:13:57,795
-You don't like it.
-No, l do.

262
00:13:57,795 --> 00:13:59,713
-You don't like it.
-No, l do.

263
00:13:59,713 --> 00:14:01,631
Tell me what's wrong with it.

264
00:14:01,631 --> 00:14:02,590
ls it the gold?

265
00:14:06,426 --> 00:14:06,426
Well.

266
00:14:07,386 --> 00:14:08,344
That's why l got it in stainless.

267
00:14:09,304 --> 00:14:10,264
Gold one's for me, dipshit.

268
00:14:10,264 --> 00:14:12,181
Why do you do that?

269
00:14:16,017 --> 00:14:16,976
Parump-a-pump-pump.

270
00:14:16,976 --> 00:14:18,894
-Merry Christmas.
-Hey, Deb.

271
00:14:19,854 --> 00:14:20,812
How's Jimmy?

272
00:14:20,812 --> 00:14:22,730
He's good. Did you get my gifts?

273
00:14:24,649 --> 00:14:26,567
l can't keep this.

274
00:14:26,567 --> 00:14:27,526
Why not?

275
00:14:27,526 --> 00:14:30,404
This is not what the Lord wants.

276
00:14:30,404 --> 00:14:32,322
So you're saying you know
what the Lord wants?

277
00:14:32,322 --> 00:14:34,240
-No.
-That's what it sounds like.

278
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:36,159
Well, l'm not saying that.
Well, l'm not...

279
00:14:36,159 --> 00:14:38,076
Mommy, look!

280
00:14:39,034 --> 00:14:40,953
Steven! Cheese and crackers!

281
00:14:44,789 --> 00:14:45,749
Bo-nos dias, Pilaf.

282
00:14:45,749 --> 00:14:47,667
Oh, hi,
Steven, you've got some visitors.

283
00:14:47,667 --> 00:14:48,626
Okey-dokey.

284
00:14:56,299 --> 00:14:57,258
We don't think so.

285
00:15:01,094 --> 00:15:02,053
Oh, God.

286
00:15:03,011 --> 00:15:04,930
Oh, great. lmpale.

287
00:15:13,562 --> 00:15:15,480
Where the fuck is the fucking stairs?

288
00:15:22,194 --> 00:15:24,112
The thing of it is, l'd been a cop.

289
00:15:25,072 --> 00:15:26,031
And l knew whatjail was like.

290
00:15:26,990 --> 00:15:27,948
Fuck me.

291
00:15:27,948 --> 00:15:29,866
There was no way l was going there.

292
00:15:30,826 --> 00:15:34,662
But l had a plan and
everything was gonna be jim-dandy.

293
00:15:51,926 --> 00:15:52,884
Oh, come on.

294
00:16:13,026 --> 00:16:14,944
Hey. Hey.

295
00:16:16,862 --> 00:16:17,820
l'm sorry.

296
00:16:18,779 --> 00:16:20,698
Why didn't you tell me?

297
00:16:20,698 --> 00:16:21,657
l can't go to prison, Jimmy.

298
00:16:22,616 --> 00:16:24,534
l can't go to prison.
l can't. l can't.

299
00:16:24,534 --> 00:16:27,412
lt's okay. Calm down.

300
00:16:27,412 --> 00:16:28,370
lt's okay.

301
00:16:30,289 --> 00:16:32,207
l just wanna tell 'em you're awake.

302
00:16:32,207 --> 00:16:35,085
We can take it from there, okay?

303
00:16:56,185 --> 00:16:58,103
l don't think he knows himself, really.

304
00:16:58,103 --> 00:17:00,980
l think that
he's searchin' for somethin'.

305
00:17:00,980 --> 00:17:02,898
Can you tell me exactly what he did?

306
00:17:03,857 --> 00:17:05,776
He has several warrants in Texas.

307
00:17:09,611 --> 00:17:10,570
l just wonder.

308
00:17:11,529 --> 00:17:15,366
ls the gay thing
and stealing something...

309
00:17:16,325 --> 00:17:18,243
that goes hand in hand or--?

310
00:17:20,162 --> 00:17:21,120
What the fuck are you talking about?

311
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:23,038
This stealing thing. ls, is you--.

312
00:17:23,998 --> 00:17:23,998
Steven!

313
00:17:28,793 --> 00:17:29,753
Steven!

314
00:17:29,753 --> 00:17:31,671
-Hey, where's my patient?
-Steven!

315
00:17:49,893 --> 00:17:51,811
-Steven, stop!
-Steven! Steven, stop!

316
00:17:51,811 --> 00:17:53,729
-Stop!
-Steven, l'm serious.

317
00:17:53,729 --> 00:17:55,648
You stop or you'll never see me again.

318
00:17:57,566 --> 00:18:00,443
-l mean it.
-Wait, stop.

319
00:18:00,443 --> 00:18:01,401
-Steven!
-No!

320
00:18:02,361 --> 00:18:03,319
-Steven, no!
-Steven, don'tjump!

321
00:18:13,870 --> 00:18:16,748
After several appeals
and some painful personal losses...

322
00:18:17,706 --> 00:18:18,666
l finally went to prison.

323
00:18:42,643 --> 00:18:45,521
Hi. Welcome to prison.

324
00:18:45,521 --> 00:18:48,397
l'm Steven. Oh, don't be scared.

325
00:18:48,397 --> 00:18:49,357
l'm not gonna hurt ya.

326
00:18:50,315 --> 00:18:53,192
First time? Yeah.

327
00:18:53,192 --> 00:18:55,111
You just need to know some
ins and outs and you'll be fine.

328
00:18:57,987 --> 00:18:58,947
Hey, let me show you around.

329
00:19:00,865 --> 00:19:01,824
Law library.

330
00:19:01,824 --> 00:19:02,783
l pretty much live here.

331
00:19:05,661 --> 00:19:08,538
Don't really have anybody on the
outside except for my ex-wife, my kid...

332
00:19:08,538 --> 00:19:10,456
so l hunker down here...

333
00:19:10,456 --> 00:19:13,334
learn everything there is to know
about the law. Ask me anything.

334
00:19:14,292 --> 00:19:17,169
See him? Over there? Him?

335
00:19:18,128 --> 00:19:19,087
Anything you want from the outside...

336
00:19:19,087 --> 00:19:20,046
he's the guy.

337
00:19:20,046 --> 00:19:21,965
Candy, cigarettes, drugs, whatever.

338
00:19:21,965 --> 00:19:24,842
He's the guy. Just keep in mind...

339
00:19:24,842 --> 00:19:26,760
it's gonna cost you a lot of money or...

340
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:29,638
you can suck his dick, your choice.

341
00:19:30,597 --> 00:19:31,556
You'll catch a beatin' any day now.

342
00:19:31,556 --> 00:19:33,474
That's just the way it is.

343
00:19:33,474 --> 00:19:35,393
l lost 3 teeth. Cracked a vertebrae.

344
00:19:35,393 --> 00:19:38,269
Anyway, all you gotta do is fight back.

345
00:19:38,269 --> 00:19:40,188
Win or lose, just fight back.

346
00:19:40,188 --> 00:19:42,106
Or you could suck the guy's dick.

347
00:19:42,106 --> 00:19:43,064
Your choice.

348
00:19:44,024 --> 00:19:45,942
Letters, magazines, shit like that...

349
00:19:45,942 --> 00:19:46,901
it all goes through unmolested.

350
00:19:47,860 --> 00:19:48,819
But if Grandma sends you cookies...

351
00:19:48,819 --> 00:19:50,737
or porn or brownies or whatever,

352
00:19:51,697 --> 00:19:52,655
you have to pay for it
if you wanna get it.

353
00:19:53,615 --> 00:19:54,573
Five bucks per item.

354
00:19:54,573 --> 00:19:56,492
Or you can suck my dick.

355
00:19:56,492 --> 00:19:57,451
Your choice.

356
00:19:58,410 --> 00:20:00,329
Anyway, that's the whole shebang.

357
00:20:01,288 --> 00:20:02,247
You'll do great. Don't worry.

358
00:20:02,247 --> 00:20:05,124
And if you need anything at all
you just ask me, all right?

359
00:20:05,124 --> 00:20:08,001
So, do l need to suck your dick?

360
00:20:08,001 --> 00:20:08,959
That'd be great.

361
00:20:12,796 --> 00:20:15,674
Hey. This is Debbie and Stephie.

362
00:20:15,674 --> 00:20:16,633
Sorry we missed you.

363
00:20:16,633 --> 00:20:19,510
Leave a message after the beep
and God bless you.

364
00:20:20,470 --> 00:20:22,388
Hey, Debbie. Hi, sweetheart.

365
00:20:22,388 --> 00:20:23,346
Sorry l missed you.

366
00:20:24,306 --> 00:20:26,224
l thought 1 :00 was our time
but maybe not. Oh, l miss you guys.

367
00:20:31,978 --> 00:20:34,855
Sometimes it's nice to know that
somebody still cares about me.

368
00:20:35,814 --> 00:20:37,732
You do still care, don't you, Deb?

369
00:20:39,650 --> 00:20:42,528
Sorry. Sometimes l forget
l'm talking to the machine.

370
00:21:23,768 --> 00:21:24,727
Thank you.

371
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:35,278
Civil law? l'm an attorney.

372
00:21:36,237 --> 00:21:37,196
Really?

373
00:21:37,196 --> 00:21:40,073
Yeah. You suing somebody?

374
00:21:40,073 --> 00:21:41,991
l don't know what l'm doing.

375
00:21:41,991 --> 00:21:46,787
A guy l know is in the infirmary...

376
00:21:46,787 --> 00:21:48,704
He's sick, real sick. He AlDS.

377
00:21:48,704 --> 00:21:53,500
Well, l thought maybe l could find a way
to get him some help...

378
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:55,419
some real help, not here, but--.

379
00:21:56,377 --> 00:21:58,295
So l thought maybe if l could--.

380
00:21:59,255 --> 00:22:02,132
l don't even really know
what l'm looking for.

381
00:22:03,091 --> 00:22:05,009
Tell him to get in touch with
the Prisoner Rights Committee.

382
00:22:05,009 --> 00:22:06,928
They deal with this all the time,
pro bono.

383
00:22:06,928 --> 00:22:07,887
l got the number.

384
00:22:07,887 --> 00:22:08,846
Why, thank you.

385
00:22:09,805 --> 00:22:10,764
My name is Steven Russell.

386
00:22:11,724 --> 00:22:12,681
Nice to meet you, Steven Russell.

387
00:22:12,681 --> 00:22:14,599
My name is Phillip Morris.

388
00:22:16,518 --> 00:22:17,477
Phillip.

389
00:22:20,354 --> 00:22:22,272
l haven't seen you around. Phillip.

390
00:22:22,272 --> 00:22:23,232
l'm always in the yard.

391
00:22:24,190 --> 00:22:26,110
Well, l, l, l don't go in that yard.

392
00:22:27,068 --> 00:22:28,986
l mean, you know what happens
to blonde haired,

393
00:22:28,986 --> 00:22:30,905
blue-eyed queers in that yard.

394
00:22:31,864 --> 00:22:33,782
lt is kind of rough out there.

395
00:22:34,741 --> 00:22:37,619
You don't look like you belong here.
Phillip.

396
00:22:37,619 --> 00:22:40,495
l rented a car. Kept it too long.

397
00:22:40,495 --> 00:22:43,372
-Grand theft?
-Theft of service.

398
00:22:43,372 --> 00:22:44,332
lnsurance fraud.

399
00:22:44,332 --> 00:22:46,250
No. Just theft of service.

400
00:22:46,250 --> 00:22:47,209
No, me. lnsurance fraud.

401
00:22:49,127 --> 00:22:50,086
Damn.

402
00:22:50,086 --> 00:22:51,045
We're in a mess, aren't we?

403
00:22:51,045 --> 00:22:52,005
lt don't seem fair, does it?

404
00:22:52,005 --> 00:22:52,963
No, it don't.

405
00:22:53,923 --> 00:22:57,759
l made the mistake of writin' her
and telling her l was lonely in here.

406
00:22:58,718 --> 00:22:59,677
Next thing you know my ex-wife

407
00:22:59,677 --> 00:23:02,555
catches her putting nthe neighbor's
puppy in a box to mail to me.

408
00:23:03,513 --> 00:23:06,391
She almost suffocated the poor thing.

409
00:23:09,267 --> 00:23:11,186
She sounds so sweet.

410
00:23:11,186 --> 00:23:12,145
Oh, she's an angel.

411
00:23:15,022 --> 00:23:17,900
l think l'm gonna write her back
tell her l'm not lonely anymore.

412
00:23:18,858 --> 00:23:20,777
That l made a good friend.

413
00:23:23,654 --> 00:23:24,614
What?

414
00:23:27,491 --> 00:23:29,408
Why'd l have to meet you today?

415
00:23:31,326 --> 00:23:32,286
Something wrong?

416
00:23:32,286 --> 00:23:34,204
lt's just, l'm being transferred...

417
00:23:34,204 --> 00:23:35,162
to the Michael Unit today.

418
00:23:36,122 --> 00:23:37,081
Oh.

419
00:23:37,081 --> 00:23:38,040
l'm sorry.

420
00:23:39,958 --> 00:23:40,918
Don't be sorry.

421
00:23:41,877 --> 00:23:43,795
lt's just across the yard.

422
00:23:43,795 --> 00:23:44,754
But l don't go out in the yard.

423
00:23:44,754 --> 00:23:46,673
lt might as well be Oklahoma.

424
00:23:47,631 --> 00:23:49,549
Just figures with my luck.

425
00:23:49,549 --> 00:23:51,468
l was born on Friday the 13th?

426
00:23:51,468 --> 00:23:53,386
lt's not gonna make a difference.

427
00:23:54,344 --> 00:23:57,222
Friday the 13th is my lucky day.

428
00:24:00,099 --> 00:24:01,059
Don't worry. lt's right here.

429
00:24:02,017 --> 00:24:02,977
This is destiny.

430
00:24:03,935 --> 00:24:05,854
But we only just met.

431
00:24:05,854 --> 00:24:06,813
Listen.

432
00:24:06,813 --> 00:24:09,690
l loved a lot and l've been around.

433
00:24:09,690 --> 00:24:11,608
So l recognize the feeling.

434
00:24:11,608 --> 00:24:13,526
That feeling you and l
are having right now.

435
00:24:13,526 --> 00:24:16,404
the feeling you're trying to forget
exists 'cause you're going away.

436
00:24:17,364 --> 00:24:20,239
But there's about 6000 volts
shooting across this table here.

437
00:24:21,199 --> 00:24:22,158
And you know you can't deny it.

438
00:24:25,035 --> 00:24:26,954
You're coming on a little strong.

439
00:24:29,830 --> 00:24:30,790
l know you're trying to
protect yourself.

440
00:24:34,626 --> 00:24:36,545
Just give me a chance
to prove you're wrong.

441
00:24:38,463 --> 00:24:41,341
l'm sure l don't know
quite what you're talking about.

442
00:24:45,176 --> 00:24:45,176
Good.

443
00:24:49,971 --> 00:24:50,931
Good.

444
00:24:51,890 --> 00:24:51,890
Good.

445
00:24:55,727 --> 00:24:56,685
Sorry.

446
00:25:18,744 --> 00:25:20,662
-You Phillip?
-Yes.

447
00:25:28,335 --> 00:25:29,294
Hi, Phillip.

448
00:25:29,294 --> 00:25:32,172
l hope your new place is nice,
nice enough anyway.

449
00:25:32,172 --> 00:25:34,090
l hope the chocolate
made it to you okay.

450
00:25:35,049 --> 00:25:36,008
Check the T.P.

451
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:46,557
l hope you try to make
some new friends and not be too shy.

452
00:25:46,557 --> 00:25:49,435
l guess l should tell you
a little bit about myself.

453
00:25:49,435 --> 00:25:50,394
Dear Steven.

454
00:25:50,394 --> 00:25:52,313
l keep thinking about you
saying l'm shy.

455
00:25:53,271 --> 00:25:54,231
l guess you're right.

456
00:25:54,231 --> 00:25:56,149
But l don't feel shy around you.

457
00:25:56,149 --> 00:25:58,067
l, l think that means somethin'.

458
00:25:58,067 --> 00:25:59,985
Anyway, thanks for the chocolate,
but l, l should tell ya,

459
00:26:00,943 --> 00:26:01,903
l, l'm diabetic.

460
00:26:01,903 --> 00:26:03,821
So l...probably shouldn't.
But l did anyway.

461
00:26:03,821 --> 00:26:06,699
Debbie and Stephie mean the world to me.

462
00:26:06,699 --> 00:26:08,617
l don't think l would have made it
this far without them.

463
00:26:08,617 --> 00:26:11,494
They're all that keeps me goin'.
Well they were.

464
00:26:12,453 --> 00:26:14,371
Steven, l wanna hear more about
your time in Virginia Beach.

465
00:26:14,371 --> 00:26:16,290
Have you been to
the Smithsonian Museum?

466
00:26:16,290 --> 00:26:17,248
-l love those old movies.
-l hear they have Archie...

467
00:26:17,248 --> 00:26:18,208
Bunker's chair there.

468
00:26:18,208 --> 00:26:19,166
l bet if l try l can
get them to show one here.

469
00:26:19,166 --> 00:26:20,126
But there'd probably be a riot

470
00:26:20,126 --> 00:26:22,044
if you showed something
in black and white.

471
00:26:22,044 --> 00:26:23,962
But it wouldn't be much fun
without you anyway.

472
00:26:23,962 --> 00:26:25,880
Do you like the top or the bottom?

473
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:26,839
l like both, l guess.

474
00:26:26,839 --> 00:26:27,798
What bunk do you like?

475
00:26:27,798 --> 00:26:29,716
Sometimes l feel
l could fill an encyclopedia

476
00:26:29,716 --> 00:26:30,676
with all the stuff l know.

477
00:26:30,676 --> 00:26:32,594
lt's been so long since
anyone's shown me any kindness

478
00:26:33,552 --> 00:26:35,470
and well, it, it means a lot.

479
00:26:36,430 --> 00:26:37,389
And l just wish you were here.

480
00:26:37,389 --> 00:26:40,266
Write me back soon.
Love, Phillip.

481
00:26:46,981 --> 00:26:48,899
Oh, come on, Cleavon!

482
00:26:49,857 --> 00:26:52,734
l ain't no motherfuckin' DHL faggot.

483
00:26:52,734 --> 00:26:55,611
Besides, l ain't got nothin'
for you anyway.

484
00:26:56,571 --> 00:26:57,529
But it's been three days.

485
00:26:57,529 --> 00:27:00,407
You got a tracking number
motherfucker, huh?

486
00:27:02,325 --> 00:27:03,285
No.

487
00:27:03,285 --> 00:27:06,162
Then shut your faggot ass.

488
00:27:20,547 --> 00:27:21,507
Oh, my God.

489
00:27:22,466 --> 00:27:23,425
How did you do this?

490
00:27:24,384 --> 00:27:26,302
l know a guy. He took care of it.

491
00:27:30,138 --> 00:27:32,057
l'm gonna take care of everything.

492
00:27:36,853 --> 00:27:38,771
Enough romance. Let's fuck.

493
00:27:41,649 --> 00:27:43,566
Oh. Shit, girl.

494
00:27:44,524 --> 00:27:46,443
Don't bite, don't bite.

495
00:27:51,239 --> 00:27:53,157
Phillip. What the fuck?

496
00:27:54,115 --> 00:27:56,034
And then l was executive assistant...

497
00:27:56,993 --> 00:27:58,911
-to a Broadway producer.
-Really.

498
00:28:00,830 --> 00:28:03,707
What would a Broadway producer
be doing in Atlanta?

499
00:28:05,625 --> 00:28:06,584
l didn't ask.

500
00:28:09,461 --> 00:28:10,419
What were you doing for him?

501
00:28:11,379 --> 00:28:15,215
l just road around town in his limo
drinking and sucking him off.

502
00:28:15,215 --> 00:28:16,175
Oh.

503
00:28:17,134 --> 00:28:19,052
Yeah, but he was a nice guy.

504
00:28:20,011 --> 00:28:21,930
l only dated him a little while anyway.

505
00:28:21,930 --> 00:28:24,806
Then l dated this full-blooded Apache.

506
00:28:24,806 --> 00:28:26,725
He used to make me
dress up as a baseball player.

507
00:28:27,684 --> 00:28:29,602
-What was his name?
-Melvin.

508
00:28:30,561 --> 00:28:33,438
Phillip. You amaze me.

509
00:28:33,438 --> 00:28:35,356
What? He was a nice guy, too.

510
00:28:36,316 --> 00:28:38,234
That's what l'm sayin'.

511
00:28:39,192 --> 00:28:40,152
You always see the good.

512
00:28:43,029 --> 00:28:43,988
What the hell is that?

513
00:28:43,988 --> 00:28:45,907
That is the Screecher next door.

514
00:28:46,865 --> 00:28:47,825
He does that all night.

515
00:28:47,825 --> 00:28:50,702
l swear to God
l don't get any sleep ever.

516
00:28:50,702 --> 00:28:52,621
-Drives me fuckin' crazy.
-Oh, man.

517
00:29:05,087 --> 00:29:06,047
Shut the fuck up!

518
00:29:08,924 --> 00:29:09,883
Shut up!

519
00:29:18,516 --> 00:29:22,352
l thank you not to screech, bitch!

520
00:29:22,352 --> 00:29:23,310
What does he care?

521
00:29:23,310 --> 00:29:25,228
He isn't in our block.

522
00:29:25,228 --> 00:29:27,146
Somebody probably paid him.

523
00:29:27,146 --> 00:29:29,065
l said shut the hell up!

524
00:29:29,065 --> 00:29:30,984
Knock it off!

525
00:29:50,164 --> 00:29:51,124
Get up.

526
00:29:54,001 --> 00:29:55,919
Did you pay to have
the Screecher beat up?

527
00:29:56,879 --> 00:29:57,837
-Me?
-Don't bullshit me.

528
00:29:58,797 --> 00:29:59,755
Did you pay to have him beat up?

529
00:30:01,674 --> 00:30:02,633
You hate that guy.

530
00:30:02,633 --> 00:30:04,551
Just answer the question.

531
00:30:13,184 --> 00:30:15,101
Yeah. Yeah, l did.

532
00:30:18,937 --> 00:30:19,896
Steven.

533
00:30:24,692 --> 00:30:27,570
That is the most romantic thing
that anyone ever did for me.

534
00:30:30,446 --> 00:30:31,406
l love you so much.

535
00:30:33,324 --> 00:30:35,242
l just want you to be happy, baby.

536
00:30:35,242 --> 00:30:38,119
You are my true soul mate.

537
00:30:39,079 --> 00:30:40,036
You're cutting of my air.

538
00:30:49,628 --> 00:30:52,505
Cleavon. Put this in.

539
00:30:53,465 --> 00:30:55,383
Not now, man. l'm fuckin' busy.

00:30:55,383 --> 00:30:57,301
-lt's important.
-How important?

541
00:31:01,138 --> 00:31:03,056
-Here.
-Ten.

542
00:31:09,769 --> 00:31:10,727
You gotta play the whole thing.

543
00:31:10,727 --> 00:31:11,687
All right, all right, all right.

544
00:31:12,646 --> 00:31:15,523
-Here. Promise.
-Fuck you. Fuck you, man.

00:32:38,964 --> 00:32:40,882
You fucking bitch.

Oh, you.

Lights out.

557
00:33:14,449 --> 00:33:16,368
Cleavon, lights out means no music.

558
00:33:16,368 --> 00:33:17,327

00:34:17,750 --> 00:34:18,708
You're transferred.

579
00:34:18,708 --> 00:34:19,668
Lonnie snitched you out
about the Screech.

580
00:34:19,668 --> 00:34:20,627
You're going to Grandview Two.

00:34:23,504 --> 00:34:24,464
Hey, wait a minute.

00:34:24,464 --> 00:34:24,464
Sit down, bitch.

585
00:34:25,422 --> 00:34:26,382
Hey, don't touch him like that!

586
00:34:26,382 --> 00:34:28,299
-Steven!
-Don't worry Phillip.

587
00:34:28,299 --> 00:34:29,258
l'll take care of this.

588
00:34:29,258 --> 00:34:31,176
You ain't gonna take care of shit.

589
00:34:31,176 --> 00:34:32,136
Don't worry!

590
00:34:43,645 --> 00:34:44,604
Steven!

591
00:35:10,499 --> 00:35:10,499
Steven!

592
00:35:14,336 --> 00:35:15,294
Steven!

593
00:35:36,395 --> 00:35:36,395

594
00:35:37,354 --> 00:35:39,272
-You do?
-l wanna go in the yard!

595
00:35:39,272 --> 00:35:41,190
Hold on, l was just doggin'.

596
00:35:58,453 --> 00:35:59,413
Steven!

597
00:36:05,167 --> 00:36:07,086

598
00:36:07,086 --> 00:36:09,003

l love you, Phillip Morris! l love you!

604
00:36:41,612 --> 00:36:44,489
Those were the longest
three months of my life.

605
00:36:46,407 --> 00:36:49,285
l wrote Phillip every day
until l got released.

606
00:36:50,244 --> 00:36:55,039
And once l did, l was determined to get
us back together as soon as possible.

607
00:36:55,039 --> 00:36:55,999
Hi, how are you?

608
00:36:56,958 --> 00:36:58,876
Yeah, well. Where're you headin'?
Greyhound?

609
00:36:58,876 --> 00:37:00,793
The nearest thrift store, please.

610
00:37:00,793 --> 00:37:04,629
Well, good. Do you mind if l tell you
the word of our Lord Jesus Christ?

611
00:37:05,589 --> 00:37:08,467
Surely goodness and mercy shall
follow me all the days of my life

612
00:37:09,425 --> 00:37:11,343
and l shall dwell in the House
of the Lord forever.

613
00:37:11,343 --> 00:37:14,221
For the Kingdom is the Lord's.
He's the governor.

614
00:37:19,976 --> 00:37:22,853
l will declare thy name
unto my brothers.

615
00:37:22,853 --> 00:37:25,729
Keep my soul and deliver me.

616
00:37:25,729 --> 00:37:29,566
Let me not be ashamed
if l put my trust in Thee.

617
00:37:29,566 --> 00:37:32,444
Wow.
That was inspiring. Thanks.

618
00:37:39,157 --> 00:37:41,075
You said you'd get here quick,
but, Jesus.

619
00:37:41,075 --> 00:37:44,912
l got a lot of work to do, honey.
l'm getting you outta here early.

620
00:37:44,912 --> 00:37:47,789
l got a hearing in the morning.
l got motions to file.

621
00:37:48,749 --> 00:37:50,666
The law don't sleep, baby.

622
00:37:51,625 --> 00:37:52,584
l love you so much.

623
00:37:53,543 --> 00:37:53,543
Phillip...

624
00:37:53,543 --> 00:37:56,420
you are the sweetest,
most gentle man l have ever known.

625
00:37:57,379 --> 00:38:00,257
And l know people

626
00:38:00,257 --> 00:38:02,175
l wanna protect you.

627
00:38:02,175 --> 00:38:04,093
l wanna make a life with you,
Phillip.

628
00:38:06,011 --> 00:38:07,930
Get me outta here.

629
00:38:12,726 --> 00:38:14,644
The motion was filed.

630
00:38:14,644 --> 00:38:17,520
l presented it to the D.A.
and got a letter from the judge.

631
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:20,397
l do not understand
what the holdup is.

632
00:38:20,397 --> 00:38:23,275
Now, l am not some paralegal.
l am Steven fucking Russo.

633
00:38:24,234 --> 00:38:26,152
And l expect proper adjudication.

634
00:38:32,866 --> 00:38:34,784
My boyfriend's
getting out of prison next week.

635
00:38:37,661 --> 00:38:39,580
That'll be two-ninety-nine.

636
00:38:49,170 --> 00:38:51,088
l have an early release order
for Phillip Morris.

637
00:38:51,088 --> 00:38:53,007
Uh-huh. Morris.

638
00:38:53,007 --> 00:38:55,883
We got him right here waiting.
And you are?

639
00:38:55,883 --> 00:38:56,843
l'm his lawyer.

640
00:39:11,229 --> 00:39:13,147
Look at you!

641
00:39:15,065 --> 00:39:16,025
Look at you.

642
00:39:16,984 --> 00:39:17,943
You're incredible.

643
00:39:18,902 --> 00:39:19,861
Yeah, l know.

644
00:39:34,247 --> 00:39:34,247
Oh, thank you.

645
00:39:34,247 --> 00:39:35,206
We're gonna need a bigger place.

646
00:39:35,206 --> 00:39:38,084
Steve, l want you
to meet my old neighbor, Eudora Mixon.

647
00:39:38,084 --> 00:39:39,042
Eudora.

648
00:39:39,042 --> 00:39:40,002
Pleasure, Steven.

649
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:42,879
Steve, Eudora owns a little building
down in Montrose and...

650
00:39:42,879 --> 00:39:44,797
she's having terrible trouble
with her builder.

651
00:39:44,797 --> 00:39:46,715
His plans were useless.

652
00:39:46,715 --> 00:39:48,633
And now he's trying to
sue me to pay him.

653
00:39:48,633 --> 00:39:50,551
Phillip says maybe you can help.

654
00:39:50,551 --> 00:39:51,511
Well, l could sure try.

655
00:39:51,511 --> 00:39:54,389
Can you still
practice law having been to prison?

656
00:39:55,347 --> 00:39:57,265
Sure. Why not?

657
00:39:59,183 --> 00:40:00,142
Oh. Well, l just--.

658
00:40:02,061 --> 00:40:06,856
l'd just be glad to have someone
l could trust. l'll pay your normal fee.

659
00:40:07,815 --> 00:40:11,651
Well, it would be my pleasure.
Litigation's my specialty.

660
00:40:13,570 --> 00:40:14,529
l told you he'd help you.

661
00:40:21,242 --> 00:40:23,160
Hi. Sorry l'm late.

662
00:40:26,996 --> 00:40:27,956
Oh, yes.

663
00:40:37,547 --> 00:40:43,301
Your Honor, Ms. Mixon engaged
Mr. Yoakum's service in good faith

664
00:40:43,301 --> 00:40:45,219
and was given an inferior product.

665
00:40:46,179 --> 00:40:48,096
She is entitled to deem
that work to be unacceptable

666
00:40:48,096 --> 00:40:50,974
according to the contract
Mr. Yoakum signed.

667
00:40:50,974 --> 00:40:53,851
The terms of that contract
were ambiguous at best.

668
00:40:53,851 --> 00:40:57,687
Truth is, defendant engaged my client
for three years without full payment.

669
00:41:05,360 --> 00:41:08,238
Your Honor, l have in my briefcase
fourteen other contracts,

670
00:41:08,238 --> 00:41:10,156
all on public record,

671
00:41:10,156 --> 00:41:13,991
in which Mr. Yoakum entered into
litigation with past clients of his.

672
00:41:14,951 --> 00:41:15,909
Oh, my goodness.

673
00:41:19,746 --> 00:41:21,664
Yeah-heh-yeah.

674
00:41:27,420 --> 00:41:27,420
Your Honor...

675
00:41:28,378 --> 00:41:32,215
l don't have to tell you that none of
this is admissible or even applicable...

676
00:41:32,215 --> 00:41:34,133
and Mr. Russell's histrionics here
hardly erase the fact

677
00:41:35,092 --> 00:41:37,011
that his client is
in breach of contract.

678
00:41:38,928 --> 00:41:40,846
Yeah. You wish.

679
00:41:40,846 --> 00:41:41,805
He's right, Mr. Russell.

680
00:41:41,805 --> 00:41:43,724
What do you have to say?

681
00:41:59,069 --> 00:42:00,028
l demand to be seen in chambers.

682
00:42:15,373 --> 00:42:17,292
All right, gentlemen.
Let's get this over with.

683
00:42:18,250 --> 00:42:20,169
Two for one at the Crab Boil ends
at five o'clock.

684
00:42:21,128 --> 00:42:23,046
lt seems pretty cut
and dry to me, sir.

685
00:42:23,046 --> 00:42:24,006
l don't even know
why we're back here.

686
00:42:24,006 --> 00:42:25,924
Mr. Russell's treating this like
an episode on Matlock.

687
00:42:27,842 --> 00:42:30,718
l will admit, Your Honor,
l'm a plainspoken man.

688
00:42:30,718 --> 00:42:33,596
l didn't go to Princeton.
l didn't go to Yale.

689
00:42:33,596 --> 00:42:35,514
My education was modest.

690
00:42:36,473 --> 00:42:37,432
l went to a small school.

691
00:42:38,392 --> 00:42:39,350
Grew up on a small farm.

692
00:42:40,310 --> 00:42:43,187
But l passed the same bar exam
as my colleague here.

693
00:42:44,146 --> 00:42:47,023
And l'm not gonna let him push
around that humble woman.

694
00:42:47,023 --> 00:42:47,983
Come on.

695
00:42:50,859 --> 00:42:51,819
Point taken...

696
00:42:53,737 --> 00:42:54,695
Mr. Russell.

697
00:42:57,573 --> 00:42:59,491
But where are you going with this?

698
00:43:03,327 --> 00:43:06,205
Well, l think it's pretty obvious
where l'm going with this, sir.

699
00:43:30,182 --> 00:43:31,140
Are you talking...

700
00:43:31,140 --> 00:43:33,060
Marshall versus Chow?

701
00:43:34,978 --> 00:43:36,896
Oh... shit.

702
00:43:36,896 --> 00:43:40,732
Your Honor, that's exactly
what l'm talking about.

703
00:43:40,732 --> 00:43:43,609
Yes! l did great!

704
00:43:43,609 --> 00:43:45,526
l mean, can you believe
how great l did?

705
00:43:47,445 --> 00:43:47,445
-Really great!
-Yes.

706
00:43:48,404 --> 00:43:49,363
l mean, seriously.

707
00:43:49,363 --> 00:43:51,282
Now, let's go out. l'm payin'.

708
00:43:51,282 --> 00:43:52,241
Oh.

709
00:43:52,241 --> 00:43:52,241
Great!

710
00:43:52,241 --> 00:43:55,118
Right this way.
Do not open your eyes,

711
00:43:55,118 --> 00:43:56,077
-little cheater.
-All right. l won't.

712
00:43:56,077 --> 00:43:57,036
-You cheater.
-l, l did not.

713
00:43:57,036 --> 00:43:57,995
-Don't open 'em.
-Tell me when.

714
00:43:57,995 --> 00:43:59,913
-Don't ruin the surprise.
-Tell me when.

715
00:43:59,913 --> 00:44:03,750
Okay. Here we go. Right now.

716
00:44:04,709 --> 00:44:06,627
Oh, my God, this is amazing.

717
00:44:06,627 --> 00:44:09,505
You like it? Oh, l'm so relieved.

718
00:44:09,505 --> 00:44:10,463
Can we afford this?

719
00:44:10,463 --> 00:44:12,381
You just let me worry about
the money, honey.

720
00:44:13,341 --> 00:44:15,259
Okay, well, l guess l better
start packing boxes.

721
00:44:15,259 --> 00:44:17,177
Not this week.

722
00:44:17,177 --> 00:44:18,136
Why not?

723
00:44:18,136 --> 00:44:20,054
Because l think we both deserve
a vacation in Key West.

724
00:44:35,400 --> 00:44:36,358
You are getting good at that.

725
00:44:40,194 --> 00:44:42,112
Oh, you don't love me.

726
00:44:47,868 --> 00:44:49,786
With Phillip l felt strong.

727
00:44:50,745 --> 00:44:53,623
l felt invincible. l promised myself...

728
00:44:53,623 --> 00:44:56,499
that he would never want for
anything ever again.

729
00:44:57,459 --> 00:45:01,294
That meant l needed a real job.
Something dependable.

730
00:45:02,253 --> 00:45:03,213
And no more scams.

731
00:45:12,804 --> 00:45:18,558
We have ignition sequence start.
There it goes. Five, four, three, two.

732
00:45:20,476 --> 00:45:22,395
Steven,
l'm sorry to keep you waiting.

733
00:45:22,395 --> 00:45:23,354
Dan Lindholm.

734
00:45:23,354 --> 00:45:24,314
Dan.

735
00:45:24,314 --> 00:45:24,314
How are ya?

736
00:45:24,314 --> 00:45:25,272
Good.

737
00:45:25,272 --> 00:45:27,189
Are you a space man, Dan?

738
00:45:27,189 --> 00:45:30,067
Uh... yeah. l mean,
l never did get out there though.

739
00:45:30,067 --> 00:45:32,944
And NASA's a real political place.
l never could quite figure out

740
00:45:32,944 --> 00:45:34,862
whose ass to kiss and get a mission.

741
00:45:34,862 --> 00:45:36,780
Well, that's all in the past now.

742
00:45:36,780 --> 00:45:38,699
Barely even think about it now.
Come on inside.

743
00:45:39,658 --> 00:45:44,454
Space man, huh?
How do you crap up there?

744
00:45:45,413 --> 00:45:48,291
Ass gasket. Have a seat.

745
00:45:48,291 --> 00:45:50,209
All right. A little bit about you.

746
00:45:50,209 --> 00:45:52,126
Steven Russell.

747
00:45:52,126 --> 00:45:55,003
When l first read your resume, well,
l didn't quite know what to think.

748
00:45:55,962 --> 00:45:56,921
l mean, your level of experience

749
00:45:56,921 --> 00:45:58,840
and your prior education,
all gonna factor...

750
00:45:58,840 --> 00:46:00,758
heavily into my decision and well--.

751
00:46:02,677 --> 00:46:06,513
Frankly, you're head
and shoulders above the rest.

752
00:46:06,513 --> 00:46:08,431
l mean, l could hardly believe it.

753
00:46:08,431 --> 00:46:09,390
When l called all your references,

754
00:46:09,390 --> 00:46:11,308
well, they couldn't speak
more highly of ya.

755
00:46:11,308 --> 00:46:14,186
l cannot speak more highly about
Steven Russell, Mr. Lindholm.

756
00:46:14,186 --> 00:46:16,104
He's a real straight-shooter.

757
00:46:16,104 --> 00:46:18,021
We were damn lucky to have him
here at Prudential as long as we did.

758
00:46:18,981 --> 00:46:19,939
Employee of the Year
two years running.

759
00:46:20,899 --> 00:46:22,817
Developing software for lBM.

760
00:46:23,776 --> 00:46:24,735
You...

761
00:46:24,735 --> 00:46:26,653
you're the kind of person
we need here, Steven.

762
00:46:27,612 --> 00:46:28,572
We want you.

763
00:46:28,572 --> 00:46:30,490
We want you to be
our Chief Financial Officer.

764
00:46:32,408 --> 00:46:33,367
l pulled all the claims...

765
00:46:33,367 --> 00:46:34,326
from the last two years along
with the statements,

766
00:46:34,326 --> 00:46:36,244
transfers and confirmations
from the bank.

767
00:46:37,204 --> 00:46:37,204
Most of it's routine

768
00:46:37,204 --> 00:46:40,081
and l think you can get up
to speed in a day or two.

769
00:46:40,081 --> 00:46:41,040
Anything else
l can do for you?

770
00:46:42,958 --> 00:46:45,834
Uh, coffee?

771
00:46:45,834 --> 00:46:49,671
l'll do that today.
But l don't do that really.

772
00:47:15,567 --> 00:47:18,444
Crossover from traditional markets
shows declination

773
00:47:18,444 --> 00:47:23,240
and inverse diffusion seems
commensurate with that trade trending.

774
00:47:23,240 --> 00:47:27,076
Uh, HMO penetrations still eats PPO,
NMO and FMO as usual.

775
00:47:27,076 --> 00:47:30,912
But attenuation is growing
more prevalent in QFour as projected.

776
00:47:30,912 --> 00:47:35,707
Now, as for Q-Three, well,
Q-Three is what Q-Three always is.

777
00:47:35,707 --> 00:47:37,626
lt's Q-Two with training wheels.

778
00:47:40,502 --> 00:47:42,420
Score. Whoo.

779
00:47:42,420 --> 00:47:44,339
Okay, Steven. You're turn.

780
00:47:46,257 --> 00:47:48,175
Now, l know you've only had
the one quarter to play catch-up...

781
00:47:48,175 --> 00:47:52,012
but l tell ya, we can't wait for
some insight here.

782
00:47:52,971 --> 00:48:01,602
Oh? Okay. You know, um,
l did a lot of work on this.

783
00:48:01,602 --> 00:48:05,439
And, uh, l think maybe--.

784
00:48:14,071 --> 00:48:16,948
Why don't l just show it to you?
Todd?

785
00:48:17,908 --> 00:48:19,826
My new assistant Todd, everybody.

786
00:48:20,784 --> 00:48:23,661
Now, if we take a look at
Mark's projections again for Q-Three.

787
00:48:23,661 --> 00:48:28,457
We'll see, well, we'll see
they're just that. Projections.

788
00:48:28,457 --> 00:48:31,334
Projections based on a model
set by my predecessor.

789
00:48:33,252 --> 00:48:35,170
l decided to reject that model.

790
00:48:35,170 --> 00:48:36,130
Do things a little differently.

791
00:48:37,088 --> 00:48:38,048
l wanna show you my results.

792
00:48:40,925 --> 00:48:43,803
This is what
we actually made in Q-Three.

793
00:48:48,599 --> 00:48:50,516
Now l wanna tell you how l did it.

794
00:48:51,474 --> 00:48:52,434
Todd, can you get me coffee?

795
00:48:53,393 --> 00:48:54,352
Anybody else want coffee?

796
00:49:08,739 --> 00:49:09,698
Steven?

797
00:49:10,657 --> 00:49:11,616
We've got a problem.

798
00:49:13,534 --> 00:49:14,493
What's that?

799
00:49:14,493 --> 00:49:15,451
Real important question.

800
00:49:18,329 --> 00:49:19,288
Do you play golf?

801
00:49:22,165 --> 00:49:23,125
Yeah.

802
00:49:23,125 --> 00:49:25,043
All right.
l'll kick your ass next week.

803
00:49:25,043 --> 00:49:26,961
All right.

804
00:49:42,306 --> 00:49:43,266
Golf?

805
00:49:43,266 --> 00:49:44,224
What?

806
00:49:44,224 --> 00:49:45,184
You're a homosexual.

807
00:49:46,142 --> 00:49:47,102
lt's for work.

808
00:49:47,102 --> 00:49:49,979
You know, you can tell them.
They can't fire you for being gay.

809
00:49:49,979 --> 00:49:50,938
l know that.

810
00:49:50,938 --> 00:49:52,857
l'm trying to be
understanding here, honey.

811
00:49:56,693 --> 00:49:57,652
Wish me luck.

812
00:49:58,611 --> 00:49:59,571
Good luck.

813
00:50:00,529 --> 00:50:02,447
Oh! Fuck me with a flaming fist!

814
00:50:02,447 --> 00:50:06,283
lt's a hell of a hazard, hey, Steven?
lt's all right. That's four. Five.

815
00:50:07,242 --> 00:50:08,201
Eat my asshole.

816
00:50:08,201 --> 00:50:10,119
Take your time.
Take a slow backswing.

817
00:50:10,119 --> 00:50:11,079
Oh, fuck!

818
00:50:11,079 --> 00:50:12,037
Six.

819
00:50:12,037 --> 00:50:12,997
Shit.

820
00:50:12,997 --> 00:50:13,956
l ain't making you nervous, am l?

821
00:50:13,956 --> 00:50:16,833
God awful whore cocksucker!

822
00:50:16,833 --> 00:50:18,752
You can quit after nine.

823
00:50:18,752 --> 00:50:20,670
Take this, you little twat!

824
00:50:20,670 --> 00:50:21,629
There you go.

825
00:50:25,466 --> 00:50:26,424
Pardon my French.

826
00:50:27,384 --> 00:50:29,302
My mother smoked
during pregnancy.

827
00:51:21,091 --> 00:51:23,010
The tux, what's the occasion?

828
00:51:23,010 --> 00:51:25,887
Just some work thing.
Were we supposed to--?

829
00:51:25,887 --> 00:51:28,764
No, no, it's fine.
Where're you goin'?

830
00:51:28,764 --> 00:51:30,683
Just some gala ball thing.

831
00:51:30,683 --> 00:51:33,560
A gala ball thing. Sounds boring.

832
00:51:33,560 --> 00:51:36,438
Yeah. l'll be home early. Promise.

833
00:51:37,396 --> 00:51:38,356
All right.

834
00:51:46,986 --> 00:51:48,906
Hey, Belle, honey, ladies.

835
00:51:48,906 --> 00:51:52,742
Hi. l want you to meet
Steven Russell, our CFO.

836
00:51:52,742 --> 00:51:53,701
Love your dress.

837
00:51:53,701 --> 00:51:55,619
Well, l heard about you.

838
00:51:55,619 --> 00:51:57,537
We're real proud of him.
Real proud.

839
00:51:57,537 --> 00:51:58,497
Are you married, Steven?

840
00:51:59,455 --> 00:52:01,373
Uh, engaged.

841
00:52:01,373 --> 00:52:03,292
Well... where is she, sweetheart?

842
00:52:04,251 --> 00:52:05,210
She works.

843
00:52:05,210 --> 00:52:06,169
Oh.

844
00:52:06,169 --> 00:52:08,088
Well, let's grab a drink.

845
00:52:08,088 --> 00:52:08,088
Okay.

846
00:52:09,047 --> 00:52:09,047
So nice to meet you.

847
00:52:09,047 --> 00:52:10,965
So nice to meet you.

848
00:52:12,882 --> 00:52:14,801
These are for Dan.

849
00:52:14,801 --> 00:52:16,719
Thanks, Steven. You doing good?

850
00:52:17,677 --> 00:52:20,555
Kinda. Just got back
from a lawyer's office.

851
00:52:20,555 --> 00:52:21,514
l asked him, what's your fee?

852
00:52:21,514 --> 00:52:24,392
He says he charges fifty dollars
for three questions.

853
00:52:24,392 --> 00:52:26,310
So l asked him, don't you think
that's a little expensive?

854
00:52:27,269 --> 00:52:30,146
He says, yes it is.
Now, what's your final question?

855
00:52:33,024 --> 00:52:34,942
Oh, that's so true. Lawyers.

856
00:52:35,901 --> 00:52:35,901
Can't trust 'em.

857
00:52:35,901 --> 00:52:36,860
Unh-uh.

858
00:52:37,818 --> 00:52:38,778
Oh, Annie. You've gotta hear this.

859
00:52:39,736 --> 00:52:41,654
There's this lawyer
with three questions.

860
00:52:41,654 --> 00:52:45,492
And then,
so the lawyer says, well, yes,

861
00:52:45,492 --> 00:52:47,410
and now you've
only one question left.

862
00:52:48,369 --> 00:52:50,287
'Cause he already asked two.

863
00:52:50,287 --> 00:52:51,246
Yeah.

864
00:52:51,246 --> 00:52:52,205
So the Northrop guy says,

865
00:52:52,205 --> 00:52:55,083
that question's gonna cost you
fifty million dollars.

866
00:52:55,083 --> 00:52:57,001
And the NASA guy says,
fifty million?

867
00:52:57,001 --> 00:52:57,959
Don't you think
that's a lot of money?

868
00:52:57,959 --> 00:53:00,837
And the Northrop guy says,
yep, that's another fifty million.

869
00:53:00,837 --> 00:53:01,797
You got anymore questions?

870
00:53:02,754 --> 00:53:03,714
Ha.

871
00:53:04,673 --> 00:53:08,509
So, this black fella says to
the Jew lawyer, fifty bucks a question.

872
00:53:08,509 --> 00:53:10,427
Man, ain't that expensive?

873
00:53:10,427 --> 00:53:13,305
Yeah, it's expensive, he says.
l'm a Jew, you nigga!

874
00:53:15,223 --> 00:53:16,182
l'm up on the left.

875
00:53:19,060 --> 00:53:20,978
Fucking moron.

876
00:53:20,978 --> 00:53:26,732
Now, maybe it was just my nature,
or maybe it was because of my past,

877
00:53:27,691 --> 00:53:28,650
or maybe it was because they were

878
00:53:28,650 --> 00:53:31,527
the most boring fuckin' people
l'd ever met in my life.

879
00:53:33,446 --> 00:53:35,364
But whatever the reason,

880
00:53:35,364 --> 00:53:37,282
l had been robbing them
blind for months.

881
00:53:42,078 --> 00:53:43,996
USAMM is
a medical management company.

882
00:53:43,996 --> 00:53:47,832
lt takes in all this HMO money
and distributes it to doctors.

883
00:53:48,791 --> 00:53:51,669
But in the time between receiving
the money and paying it out,

884
00:53:52,627 --> 00:53:55,504
it's just sitting there,
not making interest or anything.

885
00:53:56,463 --> 00:53:59,341
So, it occurred to me to
set up an investment account

886
00:53:59,341 --> 00:54:02,218
where the held money would earn
interest for the short time we had it.

887
00:54:03,177 --> 00:54:07,013
We're talking twenty-two
million dollars at any given time.

888
00:54:07,013 --> 00:54:09,891
So, even short-term,
the interest adds up pretty quickly.

889
00:54:10,850 --> 00:54:11,809
Oh, Annie, you've gotta hear this.

890
00:54:11,809 --> 00:54:13,728
l've been making the company millions.

891
00:54:13,728 --> 00:54:14,687
Virtually overnight.

892
00:54:15,646 --> 00:54:20,441
And, of course, l would take
a commission, say fifty percent.

893
00:54:22,359 --> 00:54:26,195
Me and Phillip were finally able to
start living the life we always wanted,

894
00:54:26,195 --> 00:54:28,114
the life we deserved.

895
00:54:30,032 --> 00:54:31,950
How big was this Christmas bonus?

896
00:54:31,950 --> 00:54:32,909
Pretty big.

897
00:54:33,868 --> 00:54:34,828
ln July?

898
00:54:34,828 --> 00:54:36,746
Yeah, l thought it was weird, too.

899
00:54:39,623 --> 00:54:40,582
Oh, look.

900
00:54:41,541 --> 00:54:45,376
-What are we gonna do with those?
-Oh, Steven. They got our names on.

901
00:54:58,805 --> 00:54:59,763
Larry!

902
00:55:17,985 --> 00:55:18,945
Nice car.

903
00:55:19,904 --> 00:55:20,863
Thank you, Larry.

904
00:55:21,822 --> 00:55:21,822
Which one is that?

905
00:55:22,781 --> 00:55:27,577
-lt's, uh, the SL. Driving the C?
-Yeah.

906
00:55:27,577 --> 00:55:28,536
-Hmm. Good car.
-Uh-huh.

907
00:55:28,536 --> 00:55:30,454
Good value.

908
00:56:07,858 --> 00:56:08,817
So the sheriff pulls over...

909
00:56:08,817 --> 00:56:11,695
and he finds
the missing car all wrecked

910
00:56:11,695 --> 00:56:13,613
and rolled over and
the girl inside and still alive.

911
00:56:13,613 --> 00:56:14,572
No.

912
00:56:14,572 --> 00:56:14,572
l swear to God.

913
00:56:15,531 --> 00:56:17,449
That's in the Ricky Martin People
in the bathroom.

914
00:56:17,449 --> 00:56:18,408
Oh. Must be true.

915
00:56:18,408 --> 00:56:22,244
Yeah. They can find out
all sorts of stuff, those people.

916
00:56:23,204 --> 00:56:24,164
Uh-huh.

917
00:56:24,164 --> 00:56:26,081
They can find out anything
about anyone.

918
00:56:27,039 --> 00:56:31,835
Phillip. What is it?

919
00:56:35,672 --> 00:56:36,630
lt's just--.

920
00:56:39,508 --> 00:56:41,426
ls something going on?

921
00:56:42,386 --> 00:56:44,304
Something you're not
telling me about?

922
00:56:45,263 --> 00:56:46,222
No.

923
00:56:47,181 --> 00:56:49,099
'Cause if there is, stop it now.

924
00:56:50,059 --> 00:56:51,976
There isn't. There's nothing.

925
00:56:52,934 --> 00:56:53,894
l don't care about the money.

926
00:56:54,853 --> 00:56:59,649
All l want is you.
l just want us to be together.

927
00:57:00,608 --> 00:57:02,526
We're always gonna be together.

928
00:57:02,526 --> 00:57:04,445
And there's nothing going on.

929
00:57:05,403 --> 00:57:06,363
l promise.

930
00:57:08,281 --> 00:57:10,199
l would never lie to you, baby.

931
00:57:15,953 --> 00:57:17,871
Yeah, l've got some questions about
these new accounts that we've opened.

932
00:57:18,830 --> 00:57:21,707
Uh-huh. l'd like to compare
some numbers if we could.

933
00:57:21,707 --> 00:57:24,585
And, listen, l know you normally
talk to our financial officer,

934
00:57:24,585 --> 00:57:26,503
Steven Russell about this.
But, uh--.

935
00:58:07,743 --> 00:58:10,621
You've reached the automatic
teller at Alamo Citizens Bank.

936
00:58:10,621 --> 00:58:12,539
Please enter your personal
account number.

937
00:58:13,498 --> 00:58:17,335

00:58:18,293 --> 00:58:23,089
Your account balance is eight hundred
thirty-seven thousand five--.

939
00:58:45,148 --> 00:58:46,107
Hello.

940
00:58:46,107 --> 00:58:46,107
Hey, Debbie.

941
00:58:47,066 --> 00:58:48,025
Hey, Steven. How are you?

942
00:58:48,025 --> 00:58:49,943
Good. How's Stephie doing?

943
00:58:49,943 --> 00:58:51,862
She's good, real good.

944
00:58:51,862 --> 00:58:53,781
-Good.
-She sure is her father's daughter.

945
00:58:53,781 --> 00:58:55,699
lnterested in boys already?

946
00:58:55,699 --> 00:58:56,657
Ha-ha.

947
00:58:56,657 --> 00:58:56,657
Ha-ha.

948
00:58:56,657 --> 00:58:57,616
How's Phillip?

949
00:58:57,616 --> 00:58:59,534
He says hello. Listen.

950
00:58:59,534 --> 00:59:02,411
Um, l just wanted to let you know
that l'm changing all my numbers.

951
00:59:03,370 --> 00:59:04,329
l'll let you know
when l get a new one.

952
00:59:04,329 --> 00:59:05,289
You on the lam again?

953
00:59:06,247 --> 00:59:08,166
Deb, you always knew me best.

954
00:59:09,125 --> 00:59:10,085
You really should stop this.

955
00:59:10,085 --> 00:59:10,085
l know.

956
00:59:11,043 --> 00:59:12,003
You're such a good man.

957
00:59:12,003 --> 00:59:12,961
You're right.

958
00:59:12,961 --> 00:59:14,880
And Jesus has a plan for you.

959
00:59:14,880 --> 00:59:15,839
Well, maybe this is his plan.

960
00:59:16,798 --> 00:59:18,716
Maybe He was like a mean
little boy with a magnifying glass

961
00:59:18,716 --> 00:59:20,634
and l'm just the defenseless little ant.

962
00:59:21,594 --> 00:59:23,511
Oh, that's Jesus on the other line.
l gotta go.

963
00:59:24,470 --> 00:59:25,429
-Stop it.
-l love you both, call you soon.

964
00:59:26,388 --> 00:59:27,347
Love you, too.

965
00:59:28,307 --> 00:59:28,307
Hello?

966
00:59:29,266 --> 00:59:32,143
Hey, Steven. Where are ya?

967
00:59:32,143 --> 00:59:34,062
Gulf Freeway. Where are you?

968
00:59:34,062 --> 00:59:35,020
l'm at the office.

969
00:59:35,020 --> 00:59:37,898
Hey, uh, uh, you,
you coming back anytime soon?

970
00:59:37,898 --> 00:59:39,816
No, l don't think
l'm coming back in.

971
00:59:39,816 --> 00:59:41,734
l think we both know why.

972
00:59:42,693 --> 00:59:43,653
Bye-bye, Dan.

973
00:59:58,038 --> 00:59:58,997
People keep calling.
What's going on?

974
00:59:59,957 --> 01:00:01,875
Nothin.' Thought
we'd take a little vacation.

975
01:00:01,875 --> 01:00:04,753
Key West.
Let's pack. Quick.

976
01:00:05,711 --> 01:00:07,629
Okay, l'll pack for you.

977
01:00:07,629 --> 01:00:08,589
l fuckin' knew it.

978
01:00:08,589 --> 01:00:10,507
You did somethin'.
You lied to me.

979
01:00:10,507 --> 01:00:12,425
You looked me right in the eye
and you lied.

980
01:00:12,425 --> 01:00:15,301
Don't get mad. lt'll be fine, l swear.

981
01:00:15,301 --> 01:00:17,219
You're going back to prison,
Steven?

982
01:00:17,219 --> 01:00:19,138
You promised me
we'd always be together.

983
01:00:19,138 --> 01:00:22,015
And l'm keeping that promise.
We'll never be apart. Never.

984
01:00:22,015 --> 01:00:22,975
Why do l never learn?

985
01:00:22,975 --> 01:00:25,852
And why did l listen to you?
You son of a bitch!

986
01:00:25,852 --> 01:00:27,770
We'll get a house.
Do some fishing.

987
01:00:27,770 --> 01:00:29,688
l can work on my key lime pie recipe.

988
01:00:29,688 --> 01:00:31,606
Hey, maybe l'll go a beard.

989
01:00:31,606 --> 01:00:33,524
Enter the Papa Hemingway contest.

990
01:00:33,524 --> 01:00:34,484
Honey?

991
01:00:35,443 --> 01:00:36,402
Honey?

992
01:00:37,361 --> 01:00:41,197
Phillip? Honey?
lt's gonna be easy. You'll see.

993
01:00:42,156 --> 01:00:45,034
Phillip! Phillip, come back here!

994
01:00:46,952 --> 01:00:47,910
Phillip.

995
01:00:50,788 --> 01:00:51,747
You have got to trust me.

996
01:00:56,543 --> 01:00:57,501
Don't move!

997
01:00:58,461 --> 01:01:01,339
No. Get away from me.
Get away from me!

998
01:01:01,339 --> 01:01:02,297
No.

999
01:01:02,297 --> 01:01:03,257
No!

1000
01:01:03,257 --> 01:01:07,092
There l was again,
keeping secrets, living a lie.

1001
01:01:07,092 --> 01:01:08,051
Calm down.

1002
01:01:08,051 --> 01:01:08,051
Fuck you!

1003
01:01:09,011 --> 01:01:09,969
Calm down!

1004
01:01:09,969 --> 01:01:11,887
Calm you fuckin' down.

1005
01:01:11,887 --> 01:01:12,847
Stop it, calm down.

1006
01:01:12,847 --> 01:01:17,643
l'm sorry. l didn't mean to be rude.
Like l said, l tend to do that.

1007
01:01:18,601 --> 01:01:20,520
No, l didn't blame Phillip
for running out on me.

1008
01:01:20,520 --> 01:01:22,438
But l had to get him back.

1009
01:01:23,397 --> 01:01:25,316
You see, there's something
l didn't tell you.

1010
01:01:25,316 --> 01:01:27,234
lt's about my old boyfriend,
Jimmy.

1011
01:01:27,234 --> 01:01:31,069
A long time ago,
when l was waiting to go to prison...

1012
01:01:32,028 --> 01:01:32,987
l made him a promise.

1013
01:01:35,865 --> 01:01:38,742
Come on.
You gotta drink something.

1014
01:01:42,578 --> 01:01:44,497
l want you to have this.

1015
01:01:48,333 --> 01:01:50,251
'Cause l'm gonna be leaving soon.

1016
01:01:58,883 --> 01:01:59,842
You can't leave.

1017
01:02:02,719 --> 01:02:04,637
l need you around here.

1018
01:02:05,597 --> 01:02:06,555
You're the love of my life.

1019
01:02:08,473 --> 01:02:10,392
You're sweet.

1020
01:02:11,351 --> 01:02:13,269
But, no, l'm not.

1021
01:02:13,269 --> 01:02:14,229
Sh.

1022
01:02:14,229 --> 01:02:14,229
l'm not.

1023
01:02:15,188 --> 01:02:16,147
Oh, come on.

1024
01:02:17,106 --> 01:02:19,024
l've seen him.

1025
01:02:19,024 --> 01:02:19,983
Oh, yeah.

1026
01:02:19,983 --> 01:02:21,901
You haven't met him yet.

1027
01:02:23,819 --> 01:02:28,614
But you will.
And you're gonna be so happy.

1028
01:02:32,451 --> 01:02:39,165
And l know you don't think so,
but you deserve to be happy.

1029
01:02:43,001 --> 01:02:44,919
You're not thinking clearly, baby.

1030
01:02:46,836 --> 01:02:54,510
Yes, l am. You have to promise me
you're gonna treat him right, okay?

1031
01:02:54,510 --> 01:02:57,387
Okay, okay. Now, drink some water.

1032
01:02:57,387 --> 01:02:59,305
Treat him right.

1033
01:03:17,527 --> 01:03:18,487
ls this what you wanted?

1034
01:03:18,487 --> 01:03:20,405
Yeah. Thank you.

1035
01:03:20,405 --> 01:03:21,364
Diabetic, huh?

1036
01:03:21,364 --> 01:03:22,323
Uh-huh.

1037
01:04:16,032 --> 01:04:16,032
Smell something?

1038
01:04:17,950 --> 01:04:18,909
Fuck, wha--?

1039
01:04:19,868 --> 01:04:19,868
Fuck!

1040
01:04:51,519 --> 01:04:52,476
Shit.

1041
01:04:53,436 --> 01:04:54,395
He's up.

1042
01:05:02,068 --> 01:05:03,027
Sit.

1043
01:05:08,781 --> 01:05:09,741
What'd they get you for?

1044
01:05:10,700 --> 01:05:11,659
Grand theft.

1045
01:05:11,659 --> 01:05:12,618
How about y--?

1046
01:05:23,167 --> 01:05:26,045
This slippery son of a bitch
is going straight to lock-up.

1047
01:05:27,963 --> 01:05:30,840
Oh, come on, pick up.

1048
01:05:32,758 --> 01:05:34,677
Set bail at nine hundred
thousand dollars.

1049
01:05:34,677 --> 01:05:36,596
Your Honor, we'd like to
set a reduction hearing.

1050
01:05:36,596 --> 01:05:39,473
That's your right
but l strongly advise that you don't.

1051
01:05:39,473 --> 01:05:41,391
Well, l appreciate the gra--.

1052
01:06:11,122 --> 01:06:13,040
Ma'am? You dropped somethin'.

1053
01:06:19,754 --> 01:06:23,590
Hi. l have Judge Charles Hearn
for the Clerk's Office.

1054
01:06:23,590 --> 01:06:24,550
All right, baby.

1055
01:06:24,550 --> 01:06:26,468
This is Charles Hearn.

1056
01:06:26,468 --> 01:06:27,426
l got a bail adjustment coming
through...

1057
01:06:28,386 --> 01:06:29,345

1058
01:06:29,345 --> 01:06:31,264
so could you slingshot
that shit around the sun?

1059
01:06:31,264 --> 01:06:33,181
You got it, Judge.

1060
01:06:33,181 --> 01:06:34,139
Good. Oh...

1061
01:06:34,139 --> 01:06:37,976
darlin'. You wanna save me a dime
and connect me to a good bail bondsman?

1062
01:06:37,976 --> 01:06:38,935
Fuck you.

1063
01:06:38,935 --> 01:06:45,649
Fuck you! My shoe, my shoe, my shoe.
My shoe. l'm losing this fucking shoe.

1064
01:06:45,649 --> 01:06:48,526
Come on, Phillip, pick up, it's me!

1065
01:06:49,486 --> 01:06:52,363
l'm sorry. Come on! Damn it!

1066
01:06:54,281 --> 01:06:55,241
How long you in for?

1067
01:06:55,241 --> 01:06:56,199
Not long.

1068
01:06:56,199 --> 01:06:58,117
Can you hit me
in the face with this?

1069
01:07:03,871 --> 01:07:04,831
Hold...

1070
01:07:04,831 --> 01:07:08,667
still. That's a pretty big gash.

1071
01:07:15,381 --> 01:07:17,299
Nice green uniform.

1072
01:08:08,131 --> 01:08:10,049
Sir, l wonder if you
could just get my shoes?

1073
01:08:11,008 --> 01:08:12,926
Could l just have
my shoes, please?

1074
01:08:13,885 --> 01:08:15,803
Come on, man. Seriously.
Come on.

1075
01:08:15,803 --> 01:08:17,721
You're here to
protect and serve, man.

1076
01:08:18,679 --> 01:08:20,599
Can't you just hustle
your sweet little ass

1077
01:08:20,599 --> 01:08:22,517
in there and get my fuckin' shoes?

1078
01:08:23,475 --> 01:08:26,353
Come on, Phillip.
l know you're there.

1079
01:08:33,066 --> 01:08:34,026
We've got turkey.

1080
01:08:44,576 --> 01:08:45,534
Here's your lunch, darlin'.

1081
01:08:48,412 --> 01:08:50,330
Oh. Turkey again?

1082
01:08:53,207 --> 01:08:54,166

1083
01:08:54,166 --> 01:08:55,125
Yeah.

1084
01:08:59,921 --> 01:09:00,881
What the hell is this?

1085
01:09:00,881 --> 01:09:01,839
That's all l could get.

1086
01:09:25,816 --> 01:09:27,734
Fucking vice, man.

1087
01:09:30,611 --> 01:09:30,611
But anyway--.

1088
01:09:47,875 --> 01:09:48,834
Go away, Steven.

1089
01:09:50,753 --> 01:09:51,712
You think l didn't know
you were coming?

1090
01:09:52,671 --> 01:09:52,671
Phillip?

1091
01:09:53,630 --> 01:09:54,589
Get the hell outta here.
l'm done with you.

1092
01:09:55,549 --> 01:09:59,384
Honey, l know you're upset.
But we love each other.

1093
01:10:00,343 --> 01:10:02,261
You opened a bank account
with Dr. Phillip Morris.

1094
01:10:02,261 --> 01:10:04,179
Now they think l'm in
on everything.

1095
01:10:04,179 --> 01:10:05,139
l'm facing real time.

1096
01:10:05,139 --> 01:10:07,057
You know,
it was for your own good,

1097
01:10:07,057 --> 01:10:07,057
so we could be together.

1098
01:10:08,015 --> 01:10:08,015
Fuck off.

1099
01:10:08,015 --> 01:10:09,934
l'm in enough trouble.

1100
01:10:10,893 --> 01:10:11,853
Come on, Phillip. Trust me?

1101
01:10:11,853 --> 01:10:13,771
Fuck you, you fuckin' liar.

1102
01:10:13,771 --> 01:10:15,689
Do you realize how bad
you fucked me over?

1103
01:10:15,689 --> 01:10:18,566
You made me a fuckin' accomplice,
you liar. Fuckin' liar.

1104
01:10:18,566 --> 01:10:19,525
l never wanna see you again.

1105
01:10:19,525 --> 01:10:21,443
Go away.
l never wanna see you again.

1106
01:10:21,443 --> 01:10:22,401
-Phillip, stop it.
-Go away. Go away.

1107
01:10:22,401 --> 01:10:24,319
-Phillip, stop it!
-l don't wanna see you again.

1108
01:10:26,238 --> 01:10:28,157
Well what am l supposed to do?

1109
01:10:28,157 --> 01:10:31,034
l got a, a fuckin' limo.

1110
01:10:31,034 --> 01:10:32,952
Well... you're the lawyer.
You figure it out.

1111
01:10:36,788 --> 01:10:38,706
Oh, my God.

1112
01:10:38,706 --> 01:10:40,625
You're not even a lawyer, are you?

1113
01:10:41,584 --> 01:10:44,461
You're not even a fuckin' lawyer,
are you? Fuckin' liar!

1114
01:10:44,461 --> 01:10:45,421
Phillip, open the door.

1115
01:10:45,421 --> 01:10:46,380
-No.
-Open it.

1116
01:10:46,380 --> 01:10:47,338
-No.
-Just open it.

1117
01:10:47,338 --> 01:10:48,297
No.

1118
01:10:50,216 --> 01:10:52,134
Open the door, please?

1119
01:10:53,092 --> 01:10:58,847
l just wanna say one thing, please?
Just one thing. That's all.

1120
01:11:01,725 --> 01:11:02,683
Please?

1121
01:11:18,987 --> 01:11:19,947
Get down on the ground, faggot!

1122
01:11:19,947 --> 01:11:20,906
Come on, do it! Now!

1123
01:11:21,865 --> 01:11:22,824
Get on the ground now!

1124
01:11:55,433 --> 01:11:56,393
-Phillip.
-Don't.

1125
01:11:57,351 --> 01:11:58,311
l love you.

1126
01:12:00,229 --> 01:12:03,106
From the moment we met,
you've done nothing but lie.

1127
01:12:05,024 --> 01:12:10,779
Our whole relationship, just lies.
l'm such an asshole.

1128
01:12:12,697 --> 01:12:15,574
You took advantage of me
just like all the others.

1129
01:12:16,533 --> 01:12:19,411
You were supposed to protect me.

1130
01:12:20,370 --> 01:12:23,247
But you just did nothing
butjust make a fool out of me.

1131
01:12:24,206 --> 01:12:29,960
And you expect me to love you?
How can l? How can l love you?

1132
01:12:29,960 --> 01:12:30,919
l don't even know
who you are.

1133
01:12:32,837 --> 01:12:33,796
And you know what's sad?

1134
01:12:34,755 --> 01:12:37,633
l don't even think
you know who you are.

1135
01:12:37,633 --> 01:12:39,551
So how am
l supposed to love somethin'

1136
01:12:39,551 --> 01:12:41,470
that don't even exist, you tell me.

1137
01:12:44,346 --> 01:12:46,265
l will never forgive you, Steven.
Never.

1138
01:12:57,774 --> 01:13:00,651
And that was the last time
l ever saw him.

1139
01:13:00,651 --> 01:13:02,569
But l knew he was right.

1140
01:13:03,528 --> 01:13:07,365
Phillip, Jimmy, Debbie,
they've all been right.

1141
01:13:08,323 --> 01:13:11,201
My whole life was nothing
but a bunch of lies.

1142
01:13:12,160 --> 01:13:14,079
Lies to make people
give me their money.

1143
01:13:14,079 --> 01:13:15,997
Lies to make people love me.

1144
01:13:16,956 --> 01:13:18,873
And lies to keep them
from leaving me.

1145
01:13:21,751 --> 01:13:25,587
And in the process,
l lost track of who l was.

1146
01:13:28,464 --> 01:13:30,382
Maybe Barbara Bascombe
had me pegged right

1147
01:13:30,382 --> 01:13:33,260
from the beginning and
that's why she gave me up.

1148
01:13:35,178 --> 01:13:36,138
Whatever the case,

1149
01:13:37,096 --> 01:13:39,974
how does a person who
doesn't exist go on existing?

1150
01:13:41,892 --> 01:13:45,728
The answer is, he doesn't.

1151
01:14:53,823 --> 01:14:55,741
l'm sorry to have to
tell you this, Steven.

1152
01:14:56,701 --> 01:15:03,413
Your T-cell count indicates that,
well, um, you have AlDS.

1153
01:15:13,963 --> 01:15:16,841
So here we are.
Where you first met me.

1154
01:15:17,800 --> 01:15:20,678
l've been in this bed for
months now waiting to die.

1155
01:15:21,637 --> 01:15:23,555
The only thing that
keeps me going is the thought

1156
01:15:23,555 --> 01:15:27,391
that l might get a chance to
see Phillip one more time.

1157
01:15:28,349 --> 01:15:31,227
But l don't know
how much longer l can do this.

1158
01:15:41,778 --> 01:15:42,736
You got a minute?

1159
01:15:42,736 --> 01:15:44,654
Hey, Sammy.
Do you want a cracker?

1160
01:15:44,654 --> 01:15:46,573
No. Thanks.

1161
01:15:46,573 --> 01:15:53,286
Look, um, l just talked to my friend.
He's a, um... nurse in the infirmary.

1162
01:15:53,286 --> 01:15:58,081
And, um, well, l don't know
if you know this or not. But...

1163
01:15:58,081 --> 01:15:59,040
um--.

1164
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:00,959
Let me in.

1165
01:16:00,959 --> 01:16:01,918
Just let me in!

1166
01:16:01,918 --> 01:16:02,877
He's not here.

1167
01:16:02,877 --> 01:16:03,836
l need to see him.

1168
01:16:03,836 --> 01:16:04,795
l told you...

1169
01:16:04,795 --> 01:16:05,755
he's not here.
Now, you need to calm down.

1170
01:16:06,713 --> 01:16:09,591
Just tell, tell me where he is.
Or what happened.

1171
01:16:10,550 --> 01:16:12,468
He slipped into a coma
for a few days.

1172
01:16:13,427 --> 01:16:16,303
He's conscious now.
But he's very sick.

1173
01:16:17,263 --> 01:16:20,141
We had him transferred to
a private care facility.

1174
01:16:20,141 --> 01:16:23,017
There was nothing
we could do for him here.

1175
01:16:24,935 --> 01:16:26,854
lt's just a matter of time.

1176
01:16:29,731 --> 01:16:30,690
l'm sorry.

1177
01:17:15,767 --> 01:17:16,727
Steven.

1178
01:17:18,645 --> 01:17:19,603
Steven.

1179
01:17:20,563 --> 01:17:22,481
Steven.

1180
01:17:22,481 --> 01:17:24,399
Steven.

1181
01:17:24,399 --> 01:17:26,318
Somebody wants to
speak to you.

1182
01:17:27,276 --> 01:17:30,154
He keeps calling.
He's driving us crazy.

1183
01:17:33,031 --> 01:17:33,989
Okay, you can put him through.

1184
01:17:37,826 --> 01:17:40,704
Steve, honey, it's me.

1185
01:17:42,622 --> 01:17:44,540
l didn't want you to find out.

1186
01:17:44,540 --> 01:17:46,458
Why didn't you write me?

1187
01:17:48,376 --> 01:17:52,213
l don't know how this happened.
They say l'm fine. Uh, anyway, it...

1188
01:17:52,213 --> 01:17:54,131
it doesn't matter.
l had to speak to you.

1189
01:17:55,090 --> 01:17:57,009
l'm still angry with you.

1190
01:17:57,009 --> 01:17:59,884
But there's something that l,
l want you to know.

1191
01:18:01,803 --> 01:18:07,558
Even if sometimes l don't know
who you are, l love you.

1192
01:18:08,517 --> 01:18:10,435
l never stopped loving you.

1193
01:18:11,395 --> 01:18:14,271
l guess you and me are
just fools for love or something,

1194
01:18:14,271 --> 01:18:17,149
written in the stars
or some crap like that.

1195
01:18:19,067 --> 01:18:21,944
But it was never better than
with you, Steve, never more real.

1196
01:18:22,903 --> 01:18:24,821
And l realize all that
crazy shit you did...

1197
01:18:25,780 --> 01:18:28,657
in your own fucked up way,
was always for me, always for us.

1198
01:18:29,617 --> 01:18:31,535
You're the most amazing man.

1199
01:18:32,494 --> 01:18:34,412
You take my breath away.

1200
01:18:36,330 --> 01:18:39,208
And even though
l can't be with you right now,

1201
01:18:41,126 --> 01:18:43,044
l'll always be yours.

1202
01:18:44,962 --> 01:18:45,922
Forever.

1203
01:18:50,716 --> 01:18:57,430
Now, if you have to go, go.

1204
01:18:59,348 --> 01:19:05,103
lt's okay.
l'm right there. Okay?

1205
01:19:10,858 --> 01:19:11,817
Steve?

1206
01:19:12,776 --> 01:19:16,611
Steve? Steve?

1207
01:19:17,571 --> 01:19:19,489
Steven!

1208
01:19:21,407 --> 01:19:22,367
Steven!

1209
01:19:23,325 --> 01:19:24,285
Steven!

1210
01:19:26,203 --> 01:19:28,121
Come on, honey.

1211
01:20:38,134 --> 01:20:41,012
Morris. Come with me.

1212
01:20:52,521 --> 01:20:53,480
Your lawyer's here.

1213
01:21:16,498 --> 01:21:17,457
You fucker!

1214
01:21:32,802 --> 01:21:34,720
Faking your death from AlDS
is no easy task...

1215
01:21:34,720 --> 01:21:35,680
believe me.

1216
01:21:36,638 --> 01:21:41,434
But after watching Jimmy die,
l thought l could make it convincing.

1217
01:21:41,434 --> 01:21:43,352
First, you have to starve yourself.

1218
01:21:43,352 --> 01:21:46,228
l ate half as much every day
for ten months.

1219
01:21:47,188 --> 01:21:50,065
After that, you have to
fake all sorts of symptoms.

1220
01:21:55,820 --> 01:21:56,779
Woof.

1221
01:21:57,738 --> 01:22:02,533
You gotta really stick with it
until you lose a ton of weight.

1222
01:22:04,451 --> 01:22:07,329
The hardest part is
falsifying your records.

1223
01:22:08,289 --> 01:22:11,165
But in prison for
the right amount of swag,

1224
01:22:12,124 --> 01:22:14,042
you can getjust
about anything amended.

1225
01:22:15,001 --> 01:22:18,837
After that,
bureaucracy takes over for you.

1226
01:22:20,756 --> 01:22:21,715
How long do l have?

1227
01:22:23,633 --> 01:22:24,593
There's no way to tell.

1228
01:22:28,429 --> 01:22:29,388
Yes!

1229
01:22:30,347 --> 01:22:35,142
A bureaucracy can only do so much
because the hardest part, by far,

1230
01:22:35,142 --> 01:22:38,019
is getting transferred to
a private care facility.

1231
01:22:38,978 --> 01:22:39,937
Thank you.

1232
01:22:41,856 --> 01:22:44,733
lt's standard procedure
for late stage AlDS patients.

1233
01:22:45,692 --> 01:22:46,652
But in order to do that,

1234
01:22:47,610 --> 01:22:49,528
l'd have to convince them
that l was about to die.

1235
01:22:53,365 --> 01:22:55,283
And that would involve
taking some risks.

1236
01:22:58,161 --> 01:23:01,038
After a four-day coma
they were convinced.

1237
01:23:05,833 --> 01:23:06,792
And once l got settled in...

1238
01:23:08,710 --> 01:23:10,628
l just called
the Department of Corrections

1239
01:23:10,628 --> 01:23:12,547
and convinced them that l was
a state-sponsored doctor looking for

1240
01:23:13,505 --> 01:23:15,423
late stage AlDS patients for
an experimental treatment.

1241
01:23:15,423 --> 01:23:17,342
lt's for a study we're doing.

1242
01:23:17,342 --> 01:23:20,219
And l was wondering
if you had anybody

1243
01:23:20,219 --> 01:23:25,015
that would be eligible, uh,
for a transfer into the program?

1244
01:23:25,015 --> 01:23:25,974
Mr. Russell?
Your taxi's here.

1245
01:23:25,974 --> 01:23:29,809
As luck would have it,
they had one patient eligible.

1246
01:23:30,769 --> 01:23:34,605
And for all that time,
all those doctors, all those nurses,

1247
01:23:34,605 --> 01:23:40,360
all those facilities, not one of them
ever thought to give me an AlDS test.

1248
01:23:42,278 --> 01:23:43,238
Fucking Texas.

1249
01:23:45,156 --> 01:23:48,992
And after all that hard work dying,
where's the first place l go?

1250
01:23:48,992 --> 01:23:49,951
You fucker.

1251
01:23:54,746 --> 01:23:57,624
l know. l'm sorry.
You weren't supposed to find out.

1252
01:23:58,582 --> 01:23:59,542
Well, l did.

1253
01:23:59,542 --> 01:24:01,460
l couldn't take a chance telling ya.

1254
01:24:02,419 --> 01:24:04,337
You know that l couldn't.

1255
01:24:04,337 --> 01:24:07,215
But Phillip, l only did it
so l could get here to you.

1256
01:24:09,133 --> 01:24:11,051
Butjust so l can talk again.

1257
01:24:12,969 --> 01:24:14,887
And here l am.

1258
01:24:28,314 --> 01:24:31,192
l'm fine. Just hungry.

1259
01:24:31,192 --> 01:24:34,069
Steven, l don't, we--.

1260
01:24:34,069 --> 01:24:37,906
Listen. l just came here to tell you
one thing and that's it.

1261
01:24:37,906 --> 01:24:39,824
You don't have to take me back.

1262
01:24:39,824 --> 01:24:40,782
l just wanna say one thing.

1263
01:24:42,700 --> 01:24:45,577
l know you think that
we are nothing but a lie.

1264
01:24:47,496 --> 01:24:48,454
But underneath all those lies,

1265
01:24:49,414 --> 01:24:51,332
there was always something
that was real.

1266
01:24:53,250 --> 01:24:55,168
l thought about
what you said to me.

1267
01:24:55,168 --> 01:24:57,087
You said you
don't know who l am.

1268
01:24:58,046 --> 01:24:59,005
But l know now.

1269
01:24:59,005 --> 01:25:01,883
l know who l am.
l'm not a lawyer.

1270
01:25:02,841 --> 01:25:04,759
l'm not a CFO.
l'm not a cop.

1271
01:25:04,759 --> 01:25:06,678
l'm not some kind of escape artist.

1272
01:25:07,637 --> 01:25:09,554
Those Steven Russells are dead.

1273
01:25:10,514 --> 01:25:13,391
And now all that's left is
the man that loves you.

1274
01:25:16,269 --> 01:25:17,227
And if you can see that...

1275
01:25:19,145 --> 01:25:26,818
and believe it, l promise l'll never
be anything else ever again.

1276
01:25:33,531 --> 01:25:36,409
How do l know you're not
bullshitting me again?

1277
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:47,918
You don't.
