They are really bad.

4
00:01:12,925 --> 00:01:14,916
Hair-raising.

5
00:01:15,965 --> 00:01:21,756
We need something edgy.
Something that is not totally out.

You are conscientious.

You are incredibly intelligent.

Good night, Dirk. Good night.

Outside it is freezing cold.
This is for you.

29

You can keep it.
- I can take against this.

30
00:04:13,845 --> 00:04:19,875
I think we have a good team.
- Yeah, we are. I will continue to work at home.

I can not.

39

This weekend is busy.
I'm going to London for a minute.

It would be in it.
Let's see what we have.

43
00:06:47,765 --> 00:06:51,155
What do you think?
- My bottom is wonderful.

00:06:51,325 --> 00:06:55,841
What do you think about the rest?
- It's brilliant.

45
00:07:08,805 --> 00:07:13,515
I would like to list
all budgets tomorrow morning.

46
00:07:13,685 --> 00:07:17,200
I do not have time to ...
- Do I have to do it yourself?

47
00:07:17,365 --> 00:07:22,485
No, because it's your job, Eric.
Thank you, this was all.

Good morning.
- Hello! Good morning.

49
00:07:32,765 --> 00:07:36,314
What's wrong with your eyes?
Do you have a hangover?

50
00:07:36,485 --> 00:07:40,717
I woke up in the middle of the night
and I would come up with a solution.

51
00:07:41,645 --> 00:07:44,557
Biscuits solution?
- I think so.

52
00:07:44,725 --> 00:07:48,195
I did one thing in the morning,
and I want you to look at it.

59

Really?
- Oh, yes.

00:22:33,685 --> 00:22:35,994
You can not say it.
195 of
00:22:37,365 -> 00:22:40,835
Why can not you just say it?

189
00:22:37,365 --> 00:22:40,835
Why can not you just say it?

190
00:22:49,045 --> 00:22:52,515
When I was six years old,
my parents bought -

191
00:22:52,685 --> 00:22:56,314
me and my twin
the common bicycle.
198 of the
00:22:56,485 -> 00:22:59,045
Do you have a twin sister?

192
00:22:56,485 --> 00:22:59,045
Do you have a twin sister?

193
00:23:00,605 --> 00:23:03,802
Alternately cycled to school.

194
00:23:04,925 --> 00:23:09,635
Clarissa was a better bike ride.
He knew how to ride a bicycle standing up.

195
00:23:09,805 --> 00:23:12,035
And to drive with no hands.
202 of
00:23:13,085 -> 00:23:15,645
One day, the
when it was my turn, -
203 of
00:23:15,805 -> 00:23:20,435
I wanted to show,
that cycled as well.

196
00:23:13,085 --> 00:23:15,645
One day, the
when it was my turn, -
203 of
00:23:15,805 -> 00:23:20,435
I wanted to show,
that cycled as well.

197
00:23:15,805 --> 00:23:20,435
I wanted to show,
that cycled as well.

198
00:23:21,805 --> 00:23:27,801
Pedal faster and faster.
Clarissa had to run hard.

199
00:23:29,925 --> 00:23:34,840
I let go of the handlebars.
I felt like to fly to.

200
00:23:36,125 --> 00:23:40,960
It felt wonderful.
I wanted to see myself, -

201
00:23:41,125 --> 00:23:48,236
so I looked at the window,
and thus the shadows.

202
00:23:51,205 --> 00:23:56,563
I do not know what happened.
Bike slid into the middle of the street.

203
00:23:59,325 --> 00:24:02,237
Truck ran towards me.

204
00:24:03,605 --> 00:24:09,202
All of a sudden I noticed that my sister
poking me. I flew over the handlebars.
211 of
00:24:11,685 -> 00:24:14,802
Then I remember just ...

205
00:24:11,685 --> 00:24:14,802
Then I remember just ...

206
00:24:16,525 --> 00:24:19,403
Terrible ... thump.

207
00:24:26,045 --> 00:24:31,403
When I woke up in the hospital,
I saw Mama cry.

208
00:24:33,165 --> 00:24:37,522
I asked him,
Clarisse what had happened.
215 of
00:24:37,685 -> 00:24:41,564
He did not even look at me.

209
00:24:37,685 --> 00:24:41,564
He did not even look at me.

210
00:24:42,085 --> 00:24:46,920
No one said anything,
but I knew their thoughts.

211
00:24:50,205 --> 00:24:52,719
That I killed him.

212
00:24:56,965 --> 00:25:01,197
After that, they do not ever
said he loved me.

213
00:25:09,725 --> 00:25:13,764
I love you.
- Do you love?

214
00:25:14,925 --> 00:25:17,393
You are a wonderful person.

215
00:25:35,605 --> 00:25:37,436
Dirk.
222 of
00:25:41,165 -> 00:25:45,044
You called me.
Here I am.

216
00:25:41,165 --> 00:25:45,044
You called me.
Here I am.

217
00:25:48,845 --> 00:25:52,804
Hey, Isabelle.
- Hey, Dirk. How are you?

218
00:25:54,165 --> 00:25:57,794
Happy.
- You are so tricky.

219
00:25:57,965 --> 00:26:00,195
Is that right?
226 of
00:26:01,405 -> 00:26:05,842
If things are like this,
is the best continue to work hard.

220
00:26:01,405 --> 00:26:05,842
If things are like this,
is the best continue to work hard.

221
00:26:06,805 --> 00:26:11,356
Good. - Would you leave
us two, Isabelle?
228 of
00:26:19,525 -> 00:26:23,404
He is adorable.
- Yes, it is.

222
00:26:19,525 --> 00:26:23,404
He is adorable.
- Yes, it is.

223
00:26:27,365 --> 00:26:32,723
What we do for scams?
- Fraud?

224
00:26:35,285 --> 00:26:40,564
I need a couple of months time.
Then all is well again.

225
00:26:40,725 --> 00:26:45,753
For a week.
- You are crazy. It is impossible.

226
00:26:45,925 --> 00:26:48,997
New York makes its annual accounts.

227
00:26:49,165 --> 00:26:53,795
I do not want scandal.
I can not protect you anymore.
234 of the
00:26:55,885 -> 00:26:59,924
My company has been working for you
a long time. Give me a chance.
235 of the
00:27:00,085 -> 00:27:03,964
I wrote the budget in Annex
this day signed.
236 of
00:27:04,125 -> 00:27:07,322
I'll put it in the folder.
Read it.

231
00:27:13,685 --> 00:27:17,394
Do you know what myyräni
New York says?

232
00:27:17,565 --> 00:27:23,083
They jänistävät. Now the spotlight has them
too unfinished and experimental.
239 of
00:27:24,325 -> 00:27:28,204
They're going to make a new version
choosing the right actors.

233
00:27:24,325 --> 00:27:28,204
They're going to make a new version
choosing the right actors.

234
00:27:30,765 --> 00:27:34,201
Okay.
- No!

235
00:27:34,365 --> 00:27:39,439
Upload to YouTube and show your spot,
it is that you're a genius.

236
00:27:40,085 --> 00:27:44,044
If anyone sees this,
I'm a goner.

237
00:27:44,205 --> 00:27:47,515
Pay the money back,
I'll rip it.

238
00:27:49,805 --> 00:27:53,115
Listen to me, Christine.

239
00:27:53,765 --> 00:27:57,599
This is about me.
- What the hell are you doing?

240
00:27:59,125 --> 00:28:02,435
I have a small Isabellesi.
247 of
00:28:27,125 -> 00:28:28,797
Hey.
248 of
00:28:29,965 -> 00:28:33,958
Did you get my text?
- I just got. Now is a bad time.
249 of

244
00:28:41,565 --> 00:28:44,557
Christine does not help me
to solve them.
251 of
00:28:44,725 -> 00:28:48,195
Please let me know. I can help.
- You can not.

245
00:28:44,725 --> 00:28:48,195
Please let me know. I can help.
- You can not.

246
00:28:48,365 --> 00:28:53,155
A terrible famine. Where do we go?
- Around the corner is a nice restaurant.

247
00:28:53,325 --> 00:28:56,681
You can not help me.

248
00:29:03,245 --> 00:29:06,476
Tell me what happened.
- It's over.
255 of
00:29:07,285 -> 00:29:14,714
What? - This is
thing between us out now.

249
00:29:07,285 --> 00:29:14,714
What? - This is
thing between us out now.

250
00:29:21,525 --> 00:29:25,074
Why? What did he say?

251
00:29:25,245 --> 00:29:28,874
What Christine said?
What happened in the meeting room?

252
00:29:29,045 --> 00:29:34,677
You do not get it. Christine does not care
we give a shit.

253
00:29:36,365 --> 00:29:40,358
Do not do this.
- Do not call me.

254
00:29:42,125 --> 00:29:46,482
Do not send out text messages.
Go on about your work.

255
00:30:02,085 --> 00:30:04,679
Hey. You are late.
262 of
00:30:06,165 -> 00:30:08,042
What?

256
00:30:06,165 --> 00:30:08,042
What?

257
00:30:09,765 --> 00:30:12,120
Who is sick?

258
00:30:13,645 --> 00:30:17,320
Your daughter?
I did not know you had a daughter.

259
00:30:19,685 --> 00:30:23,075
Tomorrow?
How about?

260
00:30:23,245 --> 00:30:26,521
How about,
you do not ever call me?

261
00:31:20,125 --> 00:31:24,038

Isabelle Omniphone ad
has spread like a virus.

287
00:34:07,205 --> 00:34:10,914
Advertisements should be put
in magazines and television.

288
00:34:11,085 --> 00:34:15,761
The preliminary estimation is that the
nettoamme at least 50 million.

Let's talk about that later.

Right.
- Thank you to both of you.

300
00:35:15,605 --> 00:35:17,994
Goodbye.
- Thank you.

301
00:35:30,445 --> 00:35:33,482
Why?
- You saw the report.
308 of the
00:35:33,645 -> 00:35:36,796
I think
their amendment were false.

302
00:35:33,645 --> 00:35:36,796
I think
their amendment were false.

303
00:35:36,965 --> 00:35:40,162
I had to act
very quickly.

304
00:35:40,325 --> 00:35:42,998
I missed you last night.

305
00:35:43,165 --> 00:35:46,760
Just answer the question.
Why?

306
00:35:47,405 --> 00:35:51,398
I watched you.
I listened to.

307
00:35:52,605 --> 00:35:56,757
I picked up a few things.
I did just like you would have done.
314 of
00:35:58,165 -> 00:36:03,114
This is not a back puukotusta.
This is just business.

308
00:35:58,165 --> 00:36:03,114
This is not a back puukotusta.
This is just business.

309
00:36:07,885 --> 00:36:12,037
So be it.

310
00:36:46,965 --> 00:36:49,843
<i>So?
-  Thank God. </ I></i>

311
00:36:51,165 --> 00:36:56,159
<i> Thank you for responding. </ i>
I  here. </ i> - What do you want?</i>

312
00:36:59,605 --> 00:37:06,443
<i>You were right. Christine forced </ i>
 me to put an end to our relationship. </ i></i>

313
00:37:06,605 --> 00:37:12,077
<i>Forced?
-  He's fucking dangerous. </ I></i>

314
00:37:13,685 --> 00:37:18,759
You do not understand. He is
a bit strange because of her sister at work.

315
00:37:18,925 --> 00:37:23,680
<i> her sister? What are you talking about? </ I>
- Twin Sister Clarissa.</i>

316
00:37:23,845 --> 00:37:29,397
<i> he does not have the double sisters. </ i>
 It is exactly those of his thing. </ i></i>

317
00:37:29,565 --> 00:37:34,275
<i> He told you the sad </ i>
 story to compassion. </ i></i>

318
00:37:34,445 --> 00:37:38,154
<i>Does not he have sisters?

319
00:37:38,325 --> 00:37:44,116
<i>How do you know?
-  I know Christine. </ I></i>

320
00:37:44,285 --> 00:37:48,119
<i> I know what he's like. </ i>

323
00:37:59,005 --> 00:38:03,476

324
00:38:03,645 --> 00:38:10,721
<i>I do not know, Dirk.

325
00:38:13,525 --> 00:38:17,996
<i> I need to see you. </ i>

326
00:38:18,165 --> 00:38:22,477
<i> I'm sorry. </ i>

327
00:38:23,645 --> 00:38:27,001
<i> This is his fault. </ i>

328
00:38:28,685 --> 00:38:32,439
<i>All right.

329
00:38:33,685 --> 00:38:37,883
<i> Nice, nice, nice. </ i>

330
00:38:38,045 --> 00:38:41,435

337,
00:38:55,445 -> 00:39:01,156
Hey. You are late,
I do not see you.</i>

331
00:38:55,445 --> 00:39:01,156
Hey. You are late,
I do not see you.

332
00:39:02,045 --> 00:39:04,684
Is the camera on? Dirk?

333
00:39:04,845 --> 00:39:10,203
<i> Guess again. This is me. </ I>
 Dirkiäkö miss you </ i></i>

334
00:39:11,325 --> 00:39:13,520
<i> He is here. </ i></i>

335
00:39:16,445 --> 00:39:21,360
<i> Do not point it at the camera </ i>
 me. Turn it on. </ I></i>

336
00:39:21,525 --> 00:39:24,039
<i> He is a bit Areana. </ i></i>

337
00:39:24,205 --> 00:39:29,040
<i> While we spend so nice </ i>
 evening watching a movie. </ i></i>

338
00:39:29,205 --> 00:39:32,163

 London. </ i></i>

339
00:39:34,205 --> 00:39:36,480
<i> Would you like to see? </ i></i>

340
00:41:23,765 --> 00:41:26,074
Hell!

341
00:42:13,205 --> 00:42:14,638
Shit!

342
00:42:56,165 --> 00:42:58,076
Isabelle!

343
00:43:00,485 --> 00:43:04,364
Isabelle! Is everything all right?

344
00:43:07,045 --> 00:43:12,597
What happened? I need to talk.
I noticed one strange thing.

345
00:43:16,565 --> 00:43:20,797
I am looking for one contract,
which was carried out earlier this year.

346
00:43:20,965 --> 00:43:24,958
I noticed a huge difference
Dirk Harriman on the figures provided -

347
00:43:25,685 --> 00:43:29,234
and the Middle East markets
the actual budget range.

348
00:43:29,405 --> 00:43:35,162
Christine added a folder in the Annex,
which is like a criminal prosecution.

349
00:43:48,765 --> 00:43:52,519
I knew that the man?
there was something strange. - What?

350
00:43:52,685 --> 00:43:57,440
Dirk betrayed the money, and Christine
stopped protecting him.

351
00:44:03,165 --> 00:44:07,477
Can I help you with something?
- Bring me some coffee.

352
00:44:09,925 --> 00:44:11,836
Did you hear already?

353
00:44:12,005 --> 00:44:16,521
Our managers to keep cocktail party
all department managers.

354
00:44:17,645 --> 00:44:20,443
Tomorrow night here.

355
00:44:20,605 --> 00:44:24,678
If not turn up,
get a toaster for Christmas.

356
00:44:32,565 --> 00:44:37,116
We have a little surprise for you.
I hope it amuses you.

357
00:44:37,885 --> 00:44:41,844
What are these walls
is actually happening?

358
00:44:43,565 --> 00:44:46,602
I've put together for us
a small document.

359
00:44:46,765 --> 00:44:51,441
"Very stressed-out leader
not very secret life. "

360
00:44:51,925 --> 00:44:57,477
Also included is the ecstasy and suffering
and little instruction.

361
00:45:19,605 --> 00:45:24,395
One manager will be pissed.
Familiar to us all.

362
00:45:25,885 --> 00:45:29,958
Should not be given the frustration
to domination.

363
00:45:30,125 --> 00:45:34,164
Take a deep breath,
relax and keep going.

364
00:45:35,085 --> 00:45:37,474
Is not that right?

365
00:45:37,645 --> 00:45:40,159
This will be the next piece.

366
00:45:48,405 --> 00:45:50,965
Caught red-handed.

367
00:45:51,125 --> 00:45:54,674
We all have a need for
extract a bit of pressure at work.

368
00:45:54,845 --> 00:45:59,396
You know the ones, who you are.
Go still next time the hotel.

369
00:45:59,565 --> 00:46:03,717
Outside working hours, thank you.

370
00:46:03,885 --> 00:46:05,921
What about then?

371
00:46:09,845 --> 00:46:13,997
The impact directly on the concrete column.

372
00:46:21,285 --> 00:46:24,880
Someone is not happy
parking place.

373
00:46:37,725 --> 00:46:41,115
Come on, Isabelle.
It was just a joke.

374
00:46:44,325 --> 00:46:46,714
Where's your sense of humor is?

375
00:46:48,765 --> 00:46:53,885
I think you really get hurt.

376
00:46:55,925 --> 00:46:59,042
I'm really sorry.

377
00:46:59,205 --> 00:47:02,481
I thought that we could
laugh at this one.

378
00:47:16,765 --> 00:47:19,518
It was funny.

379
00:47:52,445 --> 00:47:56,563
Hey. I would like to talk about
Katzman with your doctor.

380
00:47:59,525 --> 00:48:03,882
Stefan? Isabelle James here.
I need to see you.

381
00:48:35,565 --> 00:48:37,317
Come on in..

382
00:48:38,285 --> 00:48:40,116
Close the door.

383
00:48:51,565 --> 00:48:54,762
Isabelle, I said I was sorry.

384
00:48:54,925 --> 00:48:58,395
And yet, I got this.
- What is it?

385
00:48:59,925 --> 00:49:04,316
"I'll never forget that humiliated
to me. You'll pay for it. "

386
00:49:04,485 --> 00:49:07,318
"Revenge is sweet."

387
00:49:10,405 --> 00:49:13,920
I have not written that.
- It was sent to you from your computer.

388
00:49:14,085 --> 00:49:18,078
Not very clever.
- I did not write it.

389
00:49:18,245 --> 00:49:23,035
Hard to believe after the behavior.
- I did not write it.

390
00:49:23,205 --> 00:49:25,196
Alright.

391
00:49:27,205 --> 00:49:31,915
Deposit of this
a safe place. Approx.

392
00:49:40,885 --> 00:49:46,676
It's taken a bit of a runaway
out of control in recent times.

393
00:49:49,205 --> 00:49:52,800
I like the small dinner party
Saturday.

394
00:49:53,845 --> 00:49:58,441
There will be a few friends.
I would hope that you would come.
402,
00:50:05,285 -> 00:50:08,960
It is the folder in which you told ...
Dirk folder.

395
00:50:05,285 --> 00:50:08,960
It is the folder in which you told ...
Dirk folder.

396
00:50:09,885 --> 00:50:12,683
That's it for me.
- Okay.

397
00:50:22,965 --> 00:50:27,516
In this folder you requested.
- Thank you.

398
00:50:31,245 --> 00:50:36,194
I want to go to the ballet.
"Afternoon of a Faun" presentation.

399
00:50:40,125 --> 00:50:44,243
At ten o'clock on a Saturday night.
- Okay.

400
00:51:15,685 --> 00:51:18,643
Are you okay?
- I am.

401
00:51:25,925 --> 00:51:28,598
I beg your pardon.

402
00:51:31,565 --> 00:51:35,080
After all, he already eats pills.
- That bitch claimed him.

403
00:51:35,245 --> 00:51:40,319
It is an embarrassing story garage claimed him.
He should resign.

404
00:51:50,565 --> 00:51:52,715
I'm coming.

405
00:52:21,965 --> 00:52:26,914
Good. A bit more of a smile.
Very good.

406
00:52:57,365 --> 00:53:02,917
Thank you.
- Thank you for coming.
414,
00:53:04,485 -> 00:53:06,840
I'll walk you out.

407
00:53:04,485 --> 00:53:06,840
I'll walk you out.

408
00:53:13,005 --> 00:53:17,840
Isabelle, nice to see you,
that you use a scarf.

409
00:53:20,005 --> 00:53:23,793
How about a little kiss
and reconciliation?

410
00:53:44,645 --> 00:53:48,001
What are you doing?
- How so?

411
00:53:48,165 --> 00:53:52,238
Why kissed the bitch?
After all he is doing.

412
00:53:52,405 --> 00:53:57,604
Do not talk to me like that tone.
Keep your mouth shut and go back to work.

413
00:54:10,325 --> 00:54:14,603
Do you think nobody would notice?
- What?

414
00:54:14,765 --> 00:54:18,440
What do you want.
- What do you mean?

415
00:54:18,605 --> 00:54:20,675
Her pussy.

416
00:54:22,525 --> 00:54:27,963
Isabelle and I laugh at it.
- I do not believe you.

417
00:54:28,125 --> 00:54:32,880
Do you think I did not notice,
lesboaivoissasi what happens?

418
00:54:33,045 --> 00:54:36,799
Jealousy ruin
työtoveruutemme.

419
00:54:36,965 --> 00:54:40,480
I'm not going to put up with it.
I want you out of here.

420
00:54:40,645 --> 00:54:43,239
You can not fire me.

421
00:54:43,405 --> 00:54:47,557
I do not separate you.
You resign yourself.

422
00:54:47,725 --> 00:54:51,274
I want your resignation is
on my desk Monday morning.

423
00:54:51,445 --> 00:54:53,720
I'm not going to resign.

424
00:55:11,245 --> 00:55:14,920
While this was the
sexual harassment. - What?

425
00:55:16,685 --> 00:55:20,758
The word against the word.
Which mahdetaan believe?

426
00:56:16,085 --> 00:56:19,521
You are so charming all.

427
00:56:20,485 --> 00:56:24,922
And all so wonderfully boring.
All and sundry.

428
00:56:27,525 --> 00:56:30,961
Especially you.
It's true.

429
00:56:34,845 --> 00:56:36,642
Good night.

430
00:56:41,245 --> 00:56:43,236
Christine.

431
00:56:45,445 --> 00:56:51,634
Hello, Christine.
- Thank you for your help.

432
00:56:52,765 --> 00:56:57,964
I need to talk.
- Thank you. Good night.

433
00:56:58,965 --> 00:57:01,798
Hello to you.
- You are quite drunk.

434
00:57:01,965 --> 00:57:06,038
Yes, I am. Let's go inside.
- And not to go.
442,
00:57:07,365 -> 00:57:12,439
How did you get here?
- I drove the car really hard here.

435
00:57:07,365 --> 00:57:12,439
How did you get here?
- I drove the car really hard here.

436
00:57:12,605 --> 00:57:17,315
For God's sake. What's wrong with you?
What's going on?

437
00:57:17,485 --> 00:57:20,079
We need to talk.

438
00:57:20,245 --> 00:57:23,396
You made me ...
- There is talk now.

439
00:57:23,565 --> 00:57:28,639
You forced me to do
a very bad thing.

440
00:57:48,005 --> 00:57:52,396
You owe me.
Do not leave me in the lurch.

441
00:58:20,645 --> 00:58:22,954
DO NOT LOCK THE DOOR

442
00:58:23,125 --> 00:58:27,562
RIISUUDU, go take a shower,
SIDO your eyes and come to bed

443
01:00:20,045 --> 01:00:22,559
Let me in, Christine.

444
01:00:24,285 --> 01:00:27,322
Open the door, Christine.

445
01:01:55,245 --> 01:01:59,523
I'm coming.
Are you there?

446
01:02:57,205 --> 01:03:02,996
Days. I am a detective sergeant Bach.
He is my colleague.

447
01:03:03,165 --> 01:03:06,043
Are you Isabelle James?
- I am.

448
01:03:06,205 --> 01:03:09,038
Can we come in?
- Why?

449
01:03:11,685 --> 01:03:13,994
Are you all right?

450
01:03:14,725 --> 01:03:18,843
Are you all right?
- I do not. I have not.

451
01:03:19,005 --> 01:03:23,203
I took sleeping pills.
I can not sleep.

452
01:03:25,165 --> 01:03:30,478
Do you know that Christine Stanford
throat was slit on Saturday?

453
01:03:35,885 --> 01:03:38,160
Do you recognize this?

454
01:03:43,485 --> 01:03:49,117
Do you recognize this?
It has been sent from your computer.

455
01:03:56,245 --> 01:04:00,716
Is not the victim of some
humility now on you at work?

456
01:04:01,965 --> 01:04:04,399
Miss James?

457
01:04:08,765 --> 01:04:11,996
We found ... Miss James!

458
01:04:12,165 --> 01:04:14,281
I am here.

459
01:04:15,245 --> 01:04:19,841
We found the victim's hand, fibers,
derived from scarf.

460
01:04:20,005 --> 01:04:23,680
Such,
that you have in this picture.

461
01:04:26,445 --> 01:04:33,078
Can you explain it? Where were you
Saturday night at 23.30 - 01.00?

462
01:04:38,765 --> 01:04:42,041
I was at the ballet.
- Where?

463
01:04:43,285 --> 01:04:45,924
Ballet.

464
01:04:46,685 --> 01:04:49,643
Were you alone?
- I was.

465
01:04:49,805 --> 01:04:54,754
To identify any of you?
- Why would it have been?

466
01:04:54,925 --> 01:04:59,282
Sometimes you can meet people,
who may remember.

467
01:05:00,645 --> 01:05:03,398
Remember what?
- You to attend.

468
01:05:03,565 --> 01:05:08,559
You would have an alibi, and you should
could not kill Christine Stanford.

469
01:05:09,645 --> 01:05:12,842
I could not ...
I will never ...

470
01:05:14,405 --> 01:05:18,557
If you have a lawyer,
you should call him.

471
01:05:23,085 --> 01:05:25,804
Open your mouth.

472
01:05:30,325 --> 01:05:34,716
Laboratory confirmed,
the fibers are scarf.

473
01:05:36,085 --> 01:05:39,600
You will be charged with murder.

474
01:05:46,725 --> 01:05:50,274
Isabelle, are you okay?

475
01:05:51,925 --> 01:05:55,998
Can we get him in the water?
- Miss James.

476
01:05:57,765 --> 01:06:01,804
Is a break?
Do you need a doctor?

477
01:06:01,965 --> 01:06:05,241
I do not.
- Let's get this soon.

478
01:06:07,405 --> 01:06:13,753
Lavastitte burglary,
aggravating the offense.

479
01:06:14,645 --> 01:06:17,557
It is, therefore, of a deliberate murder.

480
01:06:19,325 --> 01:06:24,240
Why do not you just recognize?
It would save everyone time and money.

481
01:06:24,405 --> 01:06:29,081
You have a few fiber, which is suitable for
my client scarf image.

482
01:06:29,245 --> 01:06:34,444
How many other scarf they fit?
Did you find the sacrifice of my client's DNA?

483
01:06:39,445 --> 01:06:44,439
Surmasitteko Christine Stanford?
- Do not answer.

484
01:06:48,085 --> 01:06:52,397
Yes, yes, I suppose so.
- Think about what you say, Isabelle.

485
01:06:54,525 --> 01:06:58,234
What do you mean "probably"?
Surmasitteko?

486
01:06:58,405 --> 01:07:02,239
Did you kill her?
- Do not answer.

487
01:07:02,405 --> 01:07:06,284
Acknowledge that the murder?
- He did not do it.

488
01:07:07,205 --> 01:07:09,560
I confess.

489
01:07:14,365 --> 01:07:17,482
Hell!
- Forward.

490
01:07:25,005 --> 01:07:27,075
Login now!

491
01:07:30,245 --> 01:07:32,201
Away from the door!

492
01:08:27,405 --> 01:08:30,238
<i> Are you all right, Isabelle </ i></i>

493
01:08:30,405 --> 01:08:33,795
<i> Surmasitteko Christine Stanford? </ i>
- Do not respond to . </ I></i>

494
01:08:33,965 --> 01:08:37,037
<i> Surmasitteko </ i>
-  He did not do it. </ I></i>

495
01:08:37,205 --> 01:08:41,244
<i> Did you kill her? </ i>
-  My client's mental state ... </ i></i>

496
01:08:41,405 --> 01:08:45,444
<i>Heads of  confessed to the murder. </ i>
-  I confess. </ I></i>

497
01:09:04,485 --> 01:09:07,602
What?
- I want to see my lawyer.

498
01:09:07,765 --> 01:09:12,316
I did not kill Christine.
- You want a confession back?

499
01:09:12,485 --> 01:09:16,160
I'm innocent.
- Then why are you confessed?

500
01:09:16,325 --> 01:09:21,274
I do not know. I was so tired.
I was a pill drunk.

501
01:09:21,445 --> 01:09:24,994
I would have recognized anything.

502
01:09:25,885 --> 01:09:29,116
I need to talk
with the prosecutor immediately.

503
01:09:31,045 --> 01:09:35,835
This looks the same material,
but my scarf is not broken.

504
01:09:37,485 --> 01:09:41,603
Where is it?
- Somewhere in my apartment.

505
01:09:41,765 --> 01:09:45,280
We studied the apartment thoroughly
and did not find anything.

506
01:09:45,445 --> 01:09:52,317
Seek out yet. The scarf is there.
- He has no reason to lie.

507
01:09:52,485 --> 01:09:58,321
You've wasted enough of my time.
- Why would I be murdered Christine?

508
01:09:58,485 --> 01:10:03,320
You had a strong motive. Revenge.
- I have not written that.

509
01:10:03,485 --> 01:10:08,036
And if I were, then it would have been
foolish to kill him.

510
01:10:08,205 --> 01:10:12,118
Christine probably sent it to the
my computer.

511
01:10:15,445 --> 01:10:19,358
Creator. Look at the date.

512
01:10:19,525 --> 01:10:23,120
This is referred to
days before the lumps.

513
01:10:25,285 --> 01:10:29,517
Do you see? The day before
he humbled me.

514
01:10:32,045 --> 01:10:34,957
This does not make sense.
I did not write this.

515
01:10:35,125 --> 01:10:39,482
I was about to get a promotion,
Christine and bear it.

516
01:10:39,645 --> 01:10:45,242
He tried to suppress Isabelle.
Many department confirms -

517
01:10:45,405 --> 01:10:49,080
that my client became depressed
Christine's bullying of.

518
01:10:49,245 --> 01:10:51,964
Are you crazy?
That's defenses?

519
01:10:52,125 --> 01:10:55,481
Spare
mitigating circumstances for the judge!

520
01:10:55,645 --> 01:10:59,524
I'm only interested in evidence.
- It is what we are trying to give.

521
01:10:59,685 --> 01:11:03,564
I was not Christine's house.
I was at the ballet.

522
01:11:03,725 --> 01:11:06,193
You claim it.

523
01:11:09,485 --> 01:11:12,204
I talked to
Ballet with an usher.

524
01:11:12,365 --> 01:11:16,517
He had a gray, curly hair,
and he spoke bad English.

525
01:11:16,685 --> 01:11:19,153
He remembers me.

526
01:11:21,685 --> 01:11:25,917
Have you seen this woman?
- I do not.

527
01:11:26,085 --> 01:11:28,315
Do not you surely?
- I do not.

528
01:11:36,085 --> 01:11:41,079
Days. Katsoisitteko this?
Have you seen this woman?

529
01:11:43,765 --> 01:11:47,280
I am.
- Do you?

530
01:11:47,445 --> 01:11:51,961
He sat there. He wanted to
may sit in the middle of the line.

531
01:11:52,125 --> 01:11:55,003
I had to guide him in there.

532
01:11:55,165 --> 01:11:59,317
Whether or not this will certainly
this woman? - There was.

533
01:12:00,085 --> 01:12:04,601
I booked a ticket
Saturday night's myöhäisnäytökseen.

534
01:12:04,765 --> 01:12:07,882
He could not be
Christine's home.

535
01:12:08,045 --> 01:12:13,278
Maybe he left the States. Christine
the house was ten minutes away.

536
01:12:17,125 --> 01:12:22,119
Why do not you ask Dirk harrimanella?
He was reportedly there.

537
01:12:22,285 --> 01:12:26,039
He was furious,
Christine rejected because of him.

538
01:12:26,205 --> 01:12:28,241
And he was drunk.

539
01:12:29,205 --> 01:12:35,155
He knew everything from ballet.
- It is a well-known classic.

540
01:12:35,325 --> 01:12:39,716
Usher guarantee him an alibi.
What else do we have?

541
01:12:39,885 --> 01:12:43,878
His DNA was not
the murder weapon and the crime scene.

542
01:12:44,045 --> 01:12:47,560
No DNA but e-mail,
which is the only who could not write.

543
01:12:47,725 --> 01:12:52,082
As if we were forced
labile to recognize the woman.

544
01:12:52,245 --> 01:12:54,884
Just check
Christine male friend.

545
01:12:55,045 --> 01:12:58,196
Witnesses saw them
fighting over the crime scene outside.

546
01:12:58,365 --> 01:13:02,244
Or even miesystäväkin.
Either the house is checking out?

547
01:13:02,405 --> 01:13:05,556
Together, this evidence
nolaan myself in court.

548
01:13:07,925 --> 01:13:11,395
My client was accused of
wrong reasons. He has an alibi.

549
01:13:11,565 --> 01:13:15,274
Against him is not
no evidence. No DNA.

550
01:13:15,445 --> 01:13:19,120
What about the scarf fibers?
- They are not my huivistani.

551
01:13:19,285 --> 01:13:24,882
You say, then, that you have for one.
- It must be found. It is not broken.

552
01:13:25,045 --> 01:13:29,277
May I make a suggestion?
- Of course.

553
01:13:29,445 --> 01:13:34,041
Do you offer to help my client
scarf for search?

554
01:14:21,885 --> 01:14:23,762
What's this?

555
01:14:23,925 --> 01:14:30,080
Christine found out that Dirk
tried to cheat a large sum of money.

556
01:14:30,245 --> 01:14:33,794
How much?
- I do not know the exact figure.

557
01:14:33,965 --> 01:14:36,399
More than five million.

558
01:14:36,565 --> 01:14:40,399
The sum of one million of Class,
and Christine was going to expose him?

559
01:14:40,565 --> 01:14:43,477
Why piilottelitte proof?

560
01:14:43,645 --> 01:14:48,275
We are friends. Dirk needed
just the time to restore the money.

561
01:14:48,445 --> 01:14:52,563
So hid the information. Do not you
understand that it is a motive for murder?

562
01:14:52,725 --> 01:14:56,195
No! Dirk could never do that.

563
01:14:57,885 --> 01:15:01,639
We have to leave.
- Wait a minute. Can I look for?

564
01:15:01,805 --> 01:15:06,879
My scarf is in that box.
Sometimes they slip out of the back of the box.

565
01:15:07,045 --> 01:15:11,118
Alright. Let her look.
- Thank you.

566
01:15:21,205 --> 01:15:25,244
It's got to be here.
- That's enough, Isabelle.

567
01:15:25,405 --> 01:15:28,841
It's got to be here! No!

568
01:15:29,005 --> 01:15:33,556
Even a minute!
Just one minute! Do not be!

569
01:15:37,045 --> 01:15:39,081
I did not do it.

570
01:15:39,245 --> 01:15:43,397
Of course not.
I know that.

571
01:15:49,485 --> 01:15:53,842
Headscarf is
in one of the apartment.

572
01:15:54,885 --> 01:15:57,274
You have to look for it.

573
01:16:20,165 --> 01:16:23,919
What a mess.
Should I clean up?

574
01:16:25,325 --> 01:16:29,398
Where did you get this?
- It was dirty, the back of the box.

575
01:16:29,565 --> 01:16:32,443
I took it to the cleaners.

576
01:16:32,605 --> 01:16:37,121
Ms. Wirth, this is outrageous.
You will get another cleaner.

577
01:16:40,885 --> 01:16:42,637
Detective Chief Inspector Bach.

578
01:16:45,405 --> 01:16:48,715
Mr. Harriman.
- What do you want?

579
01:16:48,885 --> 01:16:53,561
I am a detective sergeant Bach.
You are accused of embezzlement.

580
01:16:53,725 --> 01:16:59,721
We studied the place.
First the car, then your apartment.

581
01:16:59,885 --> 01:17:04,083
You have to get the wire.
- The prosecutor will explain to you everything.

582
01:17:05,525 --> 01:17:08,915
Christine broke into Stanford
apartment night of the murder?

583
01:17:09,085 --> 01:17:12,634
I will not.
- Do you deny olleenne there?

584
01:17:12,805 --> 01:17:14,875
I do not.

585
01:17:15,045 --> 01:17:20,915
Were you his guest?
- I was. I arrived late.

586
01:17:21,085 --> 01:17:24,521
When?
- I do not remember.

587
01:17:24,685 --> 01:17:28,678
You do not remember?
- I do not remember.

588
01:17:36,165 --> 01:17:38,554
Is this you?

589
01:17:40,165 --> 01:17:43,282
It was scarf.

590
01:17:44,965 --> 01:17:47,081
Was that?
- Yes.

591
01:17:47,245 --> 01:17:51,955
If that's Christine Stanford
blood ... Put the recovery.

592
01:17:54,525 --> 01:17:58,757
This is ridiculous.
- Kavalsitte company money.

593
01:17:58,925 --> 01:18:03,919
Christine was going to report you.
You're a villain but also a murderer.

594
01:18:04,085 --> 01:18:09,079
I do not speak any
without a lawyer present.

595
01:18:15,245 --> 01:18:20,194
Is not it incredible?
He bought me a bouquet of roses.

596
01:18:20,365 --> 01:18:24,324
Then he showed up at my door
apologize.

597
01:18:24,485 --> 01:18:28,603
He was quite red
naamaltaan and bathed in sweat.

598
01:18:28,765 --> 01:18:31,723
He was so sorry,
I was arrested a while.

599
01:18:31,885 --> 01:18:35,321
The time sweet.
Did you invite him in?

600
01:18:35,485 --> 01:18:40,161
No, you crazy?
I smiled sweetly, -

601
01:18:40,325 --> 01:18:44,637
I took the cheap roses fool
with explanatory notes and threw them in the garbage.

602
01:18:44,805 --> 01:18:47,444
Bach poor. What a cliché.

603
01:18:47,605 --> 01:18:50,995
The hard-boiled cop
fall in love with the beautiful killer.

604
01:18:52,765 --> 01:18:55,484
I'm not a murderer.

605
01:18:57,005 --> 01:18:58,643
Oh, yeah.

606
01:18:59,725 --> 01:19:04,276
Dani ...
I know what you did for me.

607
01:19:05,765 --> 01:19:10,281
You would have done the same for me.
- Of course.

608
01:19:17,885 --> 01:19:23,562
Shall again
number 26? - Okay.

609
01:19:43,445 --> 01:19:47,643
They are okay, but do not
good enough. What do you think?

610
01:19:52,605 --> 01:19:54,436
Dani!

611
01:19:56,285 --> 01:19:59,322
That kiss did not happen.

612
01:19:59,485 --> 01:20:04,036
I love you.
I want you, Isabelle.

613
01:20:07,405 --> 01:20:09,680
That's the problem.

614
01:20:11,485 --> 01:20:15,478
Why?
- Jesus Christ! Are you kidding me?

615
01:20:21,125 --> 01:20:25,277
After all, you love me.
- I do not. What's wrong with you?

616
01:20:25,445 --> 01:20:28,198
I do not love you.
- You love.

617
01:20:28,365 --> 01:20:31,641
You may not want to admit it,
but you love me.

618
01:20:31,805 --> 01:20:36,083
We have drunk too much.
I make espressos, and I'll call a taxi.

619
01:20:36,245 --> 01:20:39,635
Go home and sleep.
Talk to you tomorrow.

620
01:20:39,805 --> 01:20:45,004
No, not tomorrow.
It's not true, Isabelle?

621
01:20:45,165 --> 01:20:49,795
You love me.
- Stop it. You are pathetic.

622
01:20:49,965 --> 01:20:53,560
Am I pathetic?
All my support after that?

623
01:20:53,725 --> 01:20:59,755
I am grateful. Thank you.
- That you gave already.

624
01:21:01,885 --> 01:21:07,278
This is the espresso. Sit down
and then find out. I'll call you a cab.

625
01:21:16,605 --> 01:21:19,597
Hello. The most space taxi.

626
01:22:09,005 --> 01:22:11,519
Ytyjä pills.

627
01:22:14,805 --> 01:22:20,994
You know, I'm not at risk.
I was wondering pills popsimistasi.

628
01:22:21,165 --> 01:22:25,761
<i> Until a couple of them fell to </ i>
 teeheni and I tasted them. </ i></i>

629
01:22:25,925 --> 01:22:29,884
They were
Sweetening harmless.

630
01:22:31,845 --> 01:22:35,838
I followed you to see
what are you gonna.

631
01:22:40,085 --> 01:22:43,794
<i> first stop </ i>
 was a scarf store. </ i></i>

632
01:22:43,965 --> 01:22:48,720
<i> You bought the same scarf as </ i>
 got Christine and hide it. </ i></i>

633
01:22:48,885 --> 01:22:50,762
<i> interesting. </ i></i>

634
01:22:53,005 --> 01:22:56,714
What about then?
Oh, and ballet.

635
01:22:58,485 --> 01:23:04,117
<i> followed you and saw how </ i>
 cause a conflict and you got an alibi. </ i></i>

636
01:23:36,525 --> 01:23:39,915
<i> last stop </ i>
 was Christine's house. </ i></i>

637
01:24:14,805 --> 01:24:18,081
<i> All the pieces fell into place </ i>
 place. </ i></i>

638
01:24:20,725 --> 01:24:22,920
The perfect moment.

639
01:24:37,525 --> 01:24:40,085
Let me in, Christine.

640
01:24:45,245 --> 01:24:49,477
<i>Confession was the bait.
-  I confess. </ I></i>

641
01:24:49,645 --> 01:24:54,355
It's a fool lieutenant swallowed up the false
hook, line and sinker clues.

642
01:25:05,525 --> 01:25:08,961
The perfect murder.
- Except for ...

643
01:25:09,805 --> 01:25:11,477
Videos.

644
01:25:11,645 --> 01:25:16,400
I gathered them aggravating
folder Lieutenant Bach.

645
01:25:16,565 --> 01:25:18,874
And I downloaded this folder.

646
01:25:19,045 --> 01:25:22,799
And can not be traced?
- I bought this for that purpose.

647
01:25:22,965 --> 01:25:28,756
Is not it cute?
You just have to press the send button.

648
01:25:38,165 --> 01:25:42,238
What do you want?
- Do not talk like that tone.

649
01:25:45,565 --> 01:25:47,840
What do you want?

650
01:25:49,605 --> 01:25:51,402
Come here.

651
01:26:04,445 --> 01:26:06,356
Sit down.

652
01:26:10,445 --> 01:26:12,754
Come closer.

653
01:26:19,725 --> 01:26:21,522
Kiss me.

654
01:26:31,485 --> 01:26:35,922
Do not like it?
You love me.

655
01:26:48,685 --> 01:26:50,880
Turn around.

656
01:27:01,005 --> 01:27:03,155
I love you.

657
01:27:59,125 --> 01:28:02,800
I thought,
the twin sister of a fairy tale.

658
01:28:03,765 --> 01:28:07,280
I did not get the opportunity to
ask for forgiveness.

659
01:28:34,325 --> 01:28:36,043
So?

660
01:31:14,485 --> 01:31:15,600
SEND ?
