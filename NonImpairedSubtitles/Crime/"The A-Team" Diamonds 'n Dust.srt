SCHECKTER: They probably have
enough ammo to hold us off all night.

455
00:35:21,527 --> 00:35:23,722
We'll attack them in the morning.

456
00:35:23,807 --> 00:35:26,321
Scheckter, you take Landers
and get some tear gas.

457
00:35:26,407 --> 00:35:28,796
We'll stand guard here until you do.

458
00:35:29,367 --> 00:35:31,801
We'll flush them out in the morning.

Where're all the workers
that were supposed to be here?

460

This lantern was lit when we ran in here.

461
00:35:47,527 --> 00:35:50,724
Fletcher probably ran them off.
Just like he tried to run off my dad.

462
00:35:50,807 --> 00:35:53,037
- Terrific.
- We better get started.

If this thing goes by the numbers, those
goons will be storming this place at sunrise.

Hannibal, we got
a regular hardware store here.

My dad was moving equipment in here
for months.

Hey B.A.

00:36:08,407 --> 00:36:11,444
Remember that two-man patrol
we did in Cambodia?

468
00:36:12,447 --> 00:36:13,641
Yeah.

469
00:36:13,727 --> 00:36:16,685
I think I can rig something up. It'll be nice.

- Can't hear a word.

473
00:38:04,607 --> 00:38:07,360
Come on out in one minute
or we'll blow the mine.

474
00:38:07,447 --> 00:38:11,076
You're bluffing.
You want this hole in the dirt left open.

475

- You won't blow it. Try again.
- You can't stay in there forever.

There's only one way out,
and it's target practice for us.

Give it up or you'll starve.

Don't worry about us.
We'll send out to the corner deli.

You guys ready?

480

You bet I am. I'm gonna pay those guys
back for what they did to Bogey.

Fletcher's gonna split.

Keep that gun on them. These guys

Somebody better give me an answer quick,
before I get mad.

I told you, that's not my end of the rope.
I run my department, Hannibal runs his.

- Ask him.
- How'd it go?

Scheckter and his grizzle are gonna testify
that Fletcher hired them.

They'll put him away for a long time.

Maybe now some of the people in this town
won't be afraid to work for me.
