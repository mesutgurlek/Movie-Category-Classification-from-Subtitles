1
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:31,000
Hey, boy!

2
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:34,200
What are you doing with my mama's car?

3
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:42,640
Wait there!

4
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:01,840
Ain't you ashamed?

5
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:04,760
Trying to steal an old lady's automobile?

6
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:06,280
What are you talking about?

7
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:07,960
I've been thinking about buying me one.

8
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:09,040
Bull!

9
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:12,720
You ain't got money for dinner,
let alone buying a car.

10
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:15,880
Well, ma'am, I'll tell you something.

11
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:20,080
I've got enough money for a Coca-Cola...

12
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:22,960
...and since it don't look like
you're going to invite me inside....

13
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:25,800
You'd steal the dining room table if I did.

14
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:29,880
You want to go into town with me?
How would that be?

15
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:32,880
I'm going to work, anyway.

16
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:37,080
You're going to work, huh?
What kind of work do you do?

17
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,000
None of your business.

18
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:41,320
I'll bet you're a movie star.

19
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:43,720
Huh? A lady mechanic?

20
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:45,880
A maid?

21
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:47,880
What do you think I am?

22
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:49,360
A waitress.

23
00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:00,480
What line of work are you in...
when you're not stealing cars?

24
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:05,000
Well, I'm looking for suitable
employment right at the moment.

25
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:07,000
Oh, yeah, but what did you do before?

26
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:10,040
I was in State Prison.

27
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:11,840
State Prison?

28
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:19,240
Well, I guess some little old lady
wasn't so nice.

29
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:23,240
It was armed robbery.

30
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:33,120
The things that turn up
in the street these days.

31
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:44,680
Hey, what do you all do for a good time
around here? Listen to the grass grow?

32
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:47,640
I guess you had a lot more fun
up at State Prison.

33
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:52,680
- I'll tell you. See my right foot?
- Yeah?

34
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:55,960
I chopped two toes off that foot
with an axe.

35
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:57,440
What! Why?

36
00:05:57,760 --> 00:06:00,640
- To get off of work detail. Want to see it?
- No!

37
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:07,960
I surely don't intend to stand
here in the middle of Main Street...

38
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:10,440
...and look at your dirty feet!

39
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:21,200
Boy, did you really do that?

40
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:38,200
What's it like?

41
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:42,240
What do you mean, prison?

42
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,480
Armed robbery.

43
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:55,920
It ain't like anything.

44
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,720
Shoot. I knew you never robbed any place,
you faker.

45
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:29,920
Bet you wouldn't have
the gumption to use it.

46
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:41,640
You just wait right here and
you keep your eyes open.

47
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:16,720
Hey, what's your name?

48
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:18,680
Clyde Barrow.

49
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:22,040
Hi, I'm Bonnie Parker.
Uh, pleased to meet you.

50
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:52,320
Hey, hey, hey, slow down,
slow down, slow down.

51
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:55,760
Take it easy, you've got my hand trapped.

52
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:57,560
Cut it out! Cut it out!

53
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:09,400
All right, now.

54
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:13,080
I might as well tell you right off.
I ain't much of a lover boy.

55
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:16,440
That don't mean nothing
personal about you.

56
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:19,080
I never saw no percentage in it.

57
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:22,120
Ain't nothing wrong with me.
I don't like boys.

58
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:28,200
Boy! Boy! Boy!

59
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:31,760
"Boy," what?

60
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,200
Your advertising is just dandy.

61
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:37,520
Folks would never guess
you don't have a thing to sell.

62
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:42,080
You'd better take me home now.

63
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:44,920
- Now, wait a minute.
- Now don't you touch me.

64
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:48,640
All right, all right...

65
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:51,200
...if all you want is a stud service,
you get on back to West Dallas,

66
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:54,000
...and you stay there, the rest of your life.

67
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:56,800
You're worth a lot more...

68
00:09:56,880 --> 00:10:00,480
...and you know it, and that's why
you're comin' along with me.

69
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:03,840
You could find a lover boy on
every damn corner in town.

70
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:05,800
Don't matter to them
if you're waiting tables or picking cotton...

71
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:08,080
...but it does make a damn to me!

72
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:11,560
Why?

73
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:15,040
"Why?" What do you mean, "why?"
Because you're different, that's why.

74
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:16,840
You know, you're like me.
You want different things.

75
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:19,840
You've got something
better than being a waitress.

76
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:23,560
You and me traveling together, we could
cut a path clean across this state...

77
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:28,080
...and Kansas and Missouri and Oklahoma,
and everybody would know about it.

78
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:31,040
You listen to me, Miss Bonnie Parker.
You listen to me.

79
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:32,840
How'd you like to go
walking into the dining room...

80
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:34,720
...of the Adolphus Hotel in Dallas...

81
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:37,920
...wearing a nice silk dress and
have everybody waiting on you?

82
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,400
Would you like that?
That seem like a lot to ask?

83
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:43,600
That ain't enough for you.
You've got a right to that.

84
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:50,720
When did you figure all that up?

85
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:53,080
The minute I saw you.

86
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:55,840
Why?

87
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:59,360
Because you may be the
best damn girl in Texas.

88
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:14,200
You were born somewhere
around east Texas, right?

89
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:16,680
Come from a big old family.

90
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:21,640
You went to school,
but you didn't take to it much...

91
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:23,920
...because you were a lot
smarter than everybody else...

92
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:26,240
...so you just up and quit one day.

93
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:30,200
Now, when you were 16... 17,
there was a guy who worked in a....

94
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:32,280
Cement plant.

95
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:33,320
Right. And you liked him...

96
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:36,440
...because he thought you were
just as nice as you could be.

97
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:39,600
You almost married that guy, but then you
thought no, you didn't think you would.

98
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:41,600
So then you got your job in a cafe.

99
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:44,600
And now you wake up every morning
and you hate it.

100
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:49,600
You just hate it. You get on down there
and you put on your white uniform....

101
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:51,680
It's pink.

102
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:54,600
Those truck drivers come there
to eat your greasy burgers and...

103
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:58,480
...they kid you and you kid them back
but they're stupid and dumb boys...

104
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:00,960
...with their big old tattoos,
and you don't like it.

105
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:03,640
They ask you for dates and sometimes
you go, but you mostly don't because...

106
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:07,160
...all they're trying to do is get in your
pants, whether you want them to or not.

107
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:09,320
So you go on home and you
sit in your room and...

108
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:11,920
...you think: "Now when, and how...

109
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:15,360
"... am I ever going to get away from this?"

110
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:19,680
And now you know.

111
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:33,440
Change that. I don't like it.

112
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:00,120
You're a knock-out!

113
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:12,120
- Hey, that ain't ours.
- Sure it is.

114
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:14,200
No, but we came in this one.

115
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:16,840
That don't mean we have to go home in it.

116
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:57,440
Where have you been keeping yourself?

117
00:13:57,520 --> 00:13:59,200
I slept out by the car.

118
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:03,280
These accommodations ain't
particularly deluxe.

119
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:05,320
If they're after us, I want the first shot.

120
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:08,320
Now, you come on out here.
We got some work to do.

121
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:20,960
You're good!

122
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:22,600
I ain't good. I'm the best.

123
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:23,880
And modest.

124
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:26,760
Now see that?

125
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:33,040
Set her spinning.

126
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:36,960
It's all right, all right.
Come on, try it again.

127
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:40,080
Try it again, now this time
come down slow, slow.

128
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:50,640
Now, how about that?
Now, ain't you something? I tell you.

129
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:53,800
I'm going to get you a Smith & Wesson.
Go in your hand easier.

130
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:56,520
- I want you to try something now.
- Hey, you!

131
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:00,040
No, sir! No, sir!

132
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:03,960
Y'all go right ahead.

133
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:19,240
It used to be my place.
But it's not anymore.

134
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:23,280
Bank took it.

135
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:31,000
Yes, sir, they moved us off.

136
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:33,440
Now it belongs to them.

137
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:39,160
Why, that's a pitiful shame.

138
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:41,040
You're damn right, ma'am.

139
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:48,600
Me and him put in the years here.

140
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:55,960
Y'all go right ahead.
We just came by for a last look.

141
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:19,200
Y'all mind?

142
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:21,280
Hey, Davis! Come on over here!

143
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:36,880
That's right.

144
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:42,640
Go on.

145
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:57,600
Much obliged.

146
00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:01,160
My name is Otis Harris. This is Davis.
We worked this place.

147
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:03,560
How're you?
This here's Miss Bonnie Parker.

148
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:05,920
- Glad to meet you.
- I'm Clyde Barrow.

149
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:13,040
We rob banks.

150
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:26,440
Look, I don't want you
to worry about nothing.

151
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:28,960
This is going to be
the easiest thing in the world.

152
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:31,080
Your mama could take this bank.

153
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:44,000
You just be ready if I need you.

154
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:10,360
What are you waiting for?

155
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:24,040
This is a stick-up! Just take it easy
and nothing's going to happen to you.

156
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:25,560
Give me the money.

157
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:28,200
Give me the money.

158
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:30,960
What money, mister?
There ain't no money here.

159
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:35,760
What are you talking about?
This here's a bank, ain't it?

160
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:40,000
Well, it was a bank,
but we failed three weeks ago.

161
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:49,800
All right, now, you get on out here.

162
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:01,680
You get on out there and tell my girl.

163
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,800
Come on, come on,
you tell her what you told me.

164
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:43,040
We've got $1.98, and you're laughing!

165
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:57,080
Let's see now.
A loaf of bread, a dozen eggs...

166
00:19:57,400 --> 00:20:00,400
...quart of milk, four fried pies.

167
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:10,320
Come on now, you sure
you ain't got no peach pies?

168
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:38,240
Get the hell out of here!

169
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:41,400
Go ahead! Go ahead!

170
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:49,480
He tried to kill me. Why'd he try
to kill me. I didn't want to hurt him.

171
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:51,880
Try to get something to eat...

172
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:55,560
...and some son of a bitch
comes up on you with a meat-cleaver.

173
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:58,360
I ain't against him.

174
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:06,840
I ain't against him.

175
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:39,600
Now, you just tell me
what was wrong with that, boy.

176
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:40,600
Dirt.

177
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:42,280
Dirt?

178
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:45,000
Dirt in the fuel line. Just blowed it away.

179
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:50,640
Excuse me, ma'am,
is there anything else I could do for you?

180
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:54,120
Well, you're a smart feller.

181
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:57,360
You sure do know a lot about automobiles,
don't you?

182
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:01,200
Yes. I guess I do.

183
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:07,880
Would you know what kind of car this is?

184
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:11,560
This is a four cylinder Ford Coupe.

185
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:16,720
Huh? Sure, sure is.

186
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:21,880
This is a stolen, four cylinder Ford Coupe.

187
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:28,400
Hey, you ain't scared, are you? Huh?

188
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:36,400
I believe he is.

189
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:40,080
That's a pity. We sure could've
used a smart boy like that...

190
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:43,040
...who knows such a great
deal about automobiles.

191
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:48,160
Are you a good driver, boy?

192
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:50,600
Yeah, reckon I am.

193
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:54,760
No, he's better off here.

194
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:57,560
What's your name, boy?

195
00:22:57,920 --> 00:22:59,080
C.W. Moss.

196
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:03,080
Well, I'm Miss Bonnie Parker
and this here is Mr. Clyde Barrow.

197
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:05,600
We rob banks.

198
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:21,080
There ain't nothing wrong with that,
is there?

199
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:27,200
Clyde, he ain't the one. Let's go.

200
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:30,040
You think you got the guts
for our line of work?

201
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:34,120
What are you talking about?
I spent a year, a year in reformatory.

202
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:36,200
A man with a record!

203
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:39,200
I know you got the nerve to short change
old ladies coming in for gas.

204
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:43,720
What I'm asking you is have you got
what it takes to pull bank jobs with us?

205
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:49,320
Sure, I do. I ain't afraid,
if that's what you think.

206
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:50,960
Prove it.

207
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:22,400
You're gonna be all right.

208
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:38,080
I'm afraid we're overdrawn again.

209
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:40,960
This is a stick-up!

210
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:44,200
This here's a stick-up!

211
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:48,000
Leave it there. Leave it there.

212
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:05,840
Come on, come on, everything.
Get it up here.

213
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:22,960
Clyde, where's the car?

214
00:27:34,360 --> 00:27:36,920
What the hell you doing, parking the car?

215
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:48,720
Stop that car!

216
00:27:51,040 --> 00:27:52,880
Up ahead, cut left! Left!

217
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:09,920
"We"re in the money, the sky is sunny

218
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:13,560
"Old man depression, you are through,
you done us wrong

219
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:17,760
"We never see a headline,
about a bread line, today

220
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:22,160
"And when we see the landlord,
we can look that guy right in the eye

221
00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:25,360
"Oh, we"re in the money,
come on, my honey"

222
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:27,840
You ain't got a brain in your skull.

223
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:39,120
On account of you, I killed a man.

224
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:43,320
And now we're all going to be wanted
for murder, and that's you too, boy.

225
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:55,800
Dumb head! Stupid!

226
00:28:57,120 --> 00:28:59,080
What were you thinking about?

227
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:04,920
Do a dumb-ass thing like that again,
boy, I'm going to kill you.

228
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:08,480
If you boys want to talk,
why don't y'all go outside?

229
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:52,240
Honey, come on, I want to talk to you
for just a minute. Sit down.

230
00:29:57,600 --> 00:30:00,440
This afternoon we killed
a man and we were seen.

231
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:02,840
Now, so far, nobody knows who you are...

232
00:30:02,920 --> 00:30:06,200
...but they know who I am and they'll be
after me and anybody who's with me.

233
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:09,040
And that's murder.
Now it's going to get rough.

234
00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:11,040
I can't get out, but right now you still can.

235
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:12,520
I want you to say the word to me...

236
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:15,200
...and I'll put you on that bus
back to your mama...

237
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:19,480
...because you mean a lot to me,
and I ain't going to make you run with me.

238
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:27,880
No!

239
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:30,880
I ain't a rich man.
You could get a rich man if you tried.

240
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:32,960
I don't want no rich man!

241
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:42,720
You ain't going to have a minute's peace.

242
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:44,000
You promise?

243
00:33:25,640 --> 00:33:27,600
Huh, at least I'm not a liar.

244
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,160
I told you I wasn't no lover boy.

245
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:13,840
Now, let me look at you boy.

246
00:34:20,680 --> 00:34:22,960
Oh boy, you can do better than that.

247
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:28,840
Hey, hey, hey, how's Mama?

248
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:31,960
Oh, fine, fine.
Sister, Sister sent her best to you.

249
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:33,960
Filling out. Must be that prison food.

250
00:34:34,040 --> 00:34:36,360
No, no, no, it's married life...

251
00:34:36,720 --> 00:34:39,120
...and, you know what they say, it's...

252
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:41,800
...it's the face powder
that gives a man interest, but...

253
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:44,800
...but it's the baking powder
that keeps him home.

254
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:49,320
I want you to meet my wife, Blanche.

255
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:50,800
This is my baby brother.

256
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:52,720
How're you doing?
It's really nice to know you.

257
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:54,040
How do you do?

258
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:09,160
I hear you're taking real good care
of the baby of the family....

259
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:11,280
I'm just so glad to meet you.
Come on over here.

260
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:13,600
I want you to meet my wife, Blanche.

261
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:19,760
Hey, everybody, this is C.W. Moss.

262
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:22,320
My brother, Buck, and his wife, Blanche.

263
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:25,440
Howdy, everybody. Howdy, you all.

264
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:29,920
Howdy, Mrs. Barrow,
or may I call you Blanche?

265
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:32,360
I sure am pleased to meet you.

266
00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:34,680
How did you find us here
in this neck of the woods?

267
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:37,200
Boy, you sure picked a good day for it.

268
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:40,160
Oh, is that a new Screenland Magazine?

269
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:42,760
Any new pictures of Myrna Loy in there?

270
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:45,280
She's my favorite picture star. May I?

271
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:49,040
Hey, let me get the Kodak here.
We'll take some pictures.

272
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:50,520
Put your pants on.
We're going to take some pictures.

273
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:52,800
Come on Blanche, get out of there!

274
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:56,120
I'm a mess. Been driving all day, honey.

275
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:06,280
Did you take my picture, Buck? I declare
I asked you not to take my picture.

276
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:08,800
Hey, Buck, get one of this.

277
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:13,000
Hey, Brother, I want to talk to you later on.

278
00:36:19,160 --> 00:36:20,400
You got that?

279
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:24,840
You take one of me and my missus,
here, Clyde.

280
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:30,000
Honestly, I don't want a picture taken.

281
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:35,200
Be serious. Be serious.

282
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:41,760
Hey, let me take one of Bonnie alone.
Come on, honey.

283
00:36:52,840 --> 00:36:54,680
Hey, honey, a little smile.

284
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:56,720
Don't want to smile, eh?

285
00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:01,120
I want to have a chat with you.
C.W., take the girls' pictures.

286
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:03,920
Why don't you step in there with Bonnie?

287
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:05,960
What did you think of her?

288
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:09,840
She's a peach.

289
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:18,840
Now, now tell me true.

290
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:22,800
Is she as good as she looks?

291
00:37:25,720 --> 00:37:26,960
She's better.

292
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:37,520
Hey, listen, it was,
it was either you or him, wasn't it?

293
00:37:37,720 --> 00:37:40,480
The guy that you killed, you had to do it.
Was either you or him.

294
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:42,160
He put me on the spot. I had to.

295
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:43,920
You had to do it, right?

296
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:49,480
I know you did.
Don't say anything to Blanche about that.

297
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:55,480
That time you broke out of jail,
is it true she talked you into going back?

298
00:37:55,560 --> 00:37:57,760
Yeah. You hear about that? Huh.

299
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:02,920
Well, I won't say nothing
to Bonnie about it.

300
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:04,720
I appreciate that.

301
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:17,760
We're going to have ourselves a time, boy!

302
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:19,080
We surely are.

303
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:27,480
What are we going to do?

304
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:34,760
I figured we all drive up to Missouri.

305
00:38:35,120 --> 00:38:36,200
They ain't looking for me up there.

306
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:40,360
We find a nice little place to hole up in.
We have us a regular vacation.

307
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:46,080
No trouble now.

308
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:48,360
I ain't looking to go back to no prison.

309
00:38:48,440 --> 00:38:50,320
I heard in prison that you had
a little trouble there.

310
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:52,400
You were cutting on your toes.

311
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:55,120
You heard about that, eh?

312
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:58,040
I did a little toe cutting.
That ain't but half of it.

313
00:38:58,120 --> 00:38:59,120
I did it so I'd get off of work detail.

314
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:02,040
You know, breaking those damn rocks
with a sledge hammer night and day.

315
00:39:02,120 --> 00:39:05,200
And you know what?
The very next week I got paroled.

316
00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:08,960
I walked out of that
God-forsaken jail on crutches.

317
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:11,400
Ain't life grand?

318
00:39:21,160 --> 00:39:25,200
Hey, you want to hear a story,
about this boy, he owned a dairy farm....

319
00:39:25,480 --> 00:39:27,760
And his old ma, she was kind of sick,
you know.

320
00:39:27,840 --> 00:39:30,840
And the doctor,
he called him over and said...

321
00:39:31,160 --> 00:39:35,520
"... Listen, your ma, just lying there,
she's just so sick and she's weakly...

322
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:39,760
"... I want you to try to persuade her
to take a little brandy, see.

323
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:41,920
"Just to pick her spirits up, you know."

324
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:46,520
"Ma's a teetotaler," he says,
"she wouldn't touch a drop."

325
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:49,760
"Well, I'll tell you what you do."
That's the doc.

326
00:39:49,840 --> 00:39:51,600
"Now, I tell you what you do...

327
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:55,040
"... you bring in a fresh quart
of milk every day...

328
00:39:55,360 --> 00:39:58,440
"... and you put some brandy in it, see.
And you try that."

329
00:39:58,520 --> 00:40:02,800
So he did, and he doctored it all up
with the brandy, fresh milk...

330
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:06,800
...and gave it to his mama,
and she drank a little bit of it.

331
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:11,360
So next day he brought it in again,
and she drank a little more, you know.

332
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:15,480
And so then, it went on that way,
the third day just a little more...

333
00:40:15,560 --> 00:40:18,640
...and the fourth day she took
a little bit more.

334
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:22,200
And then finally, a week later,
he gave her the milk...

335
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:25,960
...and she just drank it down,
she swallowed the whole thing.

336
00:40:26,040 --> 00:40:27,640
And she called him over and said...

337
00:40:27,720 --> 00:40:31,240
"... Son, whatever you do,
don't sell that cow."

338
00:40:45,080 --> 00:40:47,760
All right, you got the keys now,
haven't you?

339
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:08,920
I gave him a month's rent in advance.
We're all set. Let's get inside.

340
00:41:12,920 --> 00:41:15,520
Honey, lamb, I'm taking you
to our first home.

341
00:41:15,600 --> 00:41:17,280
"Here comes the bride"

342
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:19,640
What do you think, honey? Huh?

343
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:22,120
Just perfect.

344
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:25,000
This is your first home.

345
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:28,760
He gave me the grocery number.

346
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:37,280
4-3-3-7, please.

347
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:42,400
Hi there, Speedie's Groceries?
I want to order up a mess of groceries.

348
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:44,960
And a Frigidaire, not an ice-box.

349
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:53,880
Eight pounds of pork chops,
four pounds of red beans.

350
00:41:56,800 --> 00:41:59,320
About eight bottles of Dr. Pepper.

351
00:42:11,480 --> 00:42:13,480
You sure can play checkers.

352
00:42:22,840 --> 00:42:26,080
You need a haircut.
You're looking just like a hillbilly boy.

353
00:42:26,160 --> 00:42:28,520
You are just like an old man.

354
00:42:28,840 --> 00:42:31,920
Playing checkers all the time,
don't pay any attention to your wife.

355
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:35,920
Boy, you ain't going to ever beat me,
but you just keep trying, you hear?

356
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:39,760
Oh, Daddy, you sure do need a haircut.

357
00:42:40,520 --> 00:42:43,720
Why, you look like a little old hillbilly,
I do declare.

358
00:42:43,840 --> 00:42:46,680
Oh, mercy me, don't.

359
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:50,120
Don't talk that way when she's
right there in the next room.

360
00:42:50,200 --> 00:42:52,280
There's always somebody in
the next room, in this room...

361
00:42:52,360 --> 00:42:54,520
...or in every other kind of room.

362
00:42:57,360 --> 00:42:59,800
Don't you ever just want
to be alone with me?

363
00:42:59,880 --> 00:43:02,200
Well, I always feel like we're alone.

364
00:43:03,560 --> 00:43:04,880
Do you, baby?

365
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:06,400
I'm hungry.

366
00:43:19,400 --> 00:43:20,800
Groceries, ma'am.

367
00:43:23,240 --> 00:43:25,480
- How much?
- Six dollars and 43 cents.

368
00:43:43,600 --> 00:43:45,320
Let me help you, those bags are heavy.

369
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:47,200
No thanks, I'll get them.

370
00:43:47,600 --> 00:43:49,200
Uh, just get the door.

371
00:44:06,280 --> 00:44:08,760
"But few of them really are justified...

372
00:44:09,120 --> 00:44:11,520
"... if you get right down to the point.

373
00:44:12,280 --> 00:44:16,280
"You've heard of a woman's glory
being spent on a downright cur."

374
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:18,520
Did you write all that yourself?

375
00:44:18,640 --> 00:44:20,960
Do you want to hear this or not?

376
00:44:23,120 --> 00:44:26,800
"Still you can't always
judge the story as true...

377
00:44:27,120 --> 00:44:28,960
"... being told by her.

378
00:44:31,800 --> 00:44:34,480
"Now Sal was a gal of rare beauty...

379
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:37,400
"... though her features
were coarse and tough... "

380
00:44:37,480 --> 00:44:38,720
I knew that old gal.

381
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:41,920
She was cock-eyed
and she had a hare lip and no teeth.

382
00:44:45,320 --> 00:44:47,560
"Now Sal was a gal of rare beauty...

383
00:44:47,640 --> 00:44:50,480
"... though her features
were coarse and tough.

384
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:55,160
"She never once faltered from duty,
to play on the up and up.

385
00:44:56,640 --> 00:44:59,480
"Sal told me this tale on the evening...

386
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,200
"... before she was turned out free.

387
00:45:02,840 --> 00:45:06,520
"And I'll do my best to relate it,
just as she told it to me... "

388
00:45:06,840 --> 00:45:10,840
Hey, hey! The laws are outside!
They're blocking the driveway.

389
00:45:26,040 --> 00:45:28,360
- Please get us out of here.
- Shut up!

390
00:45:30,520 --> 00:45:33,440
They got us blocked.
We've got to get the car out.

391
00:46:13,720 --> 00:46:15,920
Where's Blanche? Where's Blanche?

392
00:46:34,920 --> 00:46:37,080
Damn it, you almost got us killed!

393
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:41,600
What did I do wrong?
I thought you'd be happy if I got shot!

394
00:46:41,920 --> 00:46:45,280
Yeah! Yeah, it would have saved us all
a lot of trouble!

395
00:46:45,920 --> 00:46:47,680
Buck, don't let that woman
talk to me like that!

396
00:46:47,760 --> 00:46:51,440
You shouldn't have done that, Blanche.
It was a dumb thing to do.

397
00:46:52,080 --> 00:46:56,120
Oh Buck, please, I didn't marry you
to see you get shot, honey.

398
00:46:56,960 --> 00:46:58,960
Let's leave. Let's get out of here and leave.

399
00:46:59,040 --> 00:47:01,800
Tell him to please stop the car
and let us out.

400
00:47:03,120 --> 00:47:05,320
I killed a guy. Now we're in this.

401
00:47:07,120 --> 00:47:08,200
Will you shut up!

402
00:47:08,280 --> 00:47:10,040
Just shut up your big mouth!

403
00:47:10,120 --> 00:47:11,560
At least do that, just shut up!

404
00:47:11,640 --> 00:47:13,120
Cut it out, Bonnie!

405
00:47:15,280 --> 00:47:17,640
Stop the car. I want to talk to you.

406
00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:35,920
Get, get rid of her.

407
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:37,560
I can't get, she's Buck's wife.

408
00:47:37,640 --> 00:47:38,920
Then, get rid of them both.

409
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:40,400
Why? What's the matter with you?

410
00:47:40,480 --> 00:47:42,080
She is what's the matter with me.

411
00:47:42,160 --> 00:47:45,680
She, she's nothing but a dumb,
stupid, back-country hick.

412
00:47:46,840 --> 00:47:48,560
She ain't got a brain in her head.

413
00:47:48,680 --> 00:47:51,080
What makes you any better?
What makes you so damn special?

414
00:47:51,160 --> 00:47:55,600
You were just a West Dallas waitress.
Spent your time picking up truck drivers.

415
00:47:56,160 --> 00:47:59,680
Oh, big Clyde Barrow!
You're just like your brother!

416
00:48:00,160 --> 00:48:02,360
Ignorant, uneducated, hillbilly!

417
00:48:02,680 --> 00:48:06,280
The only special thing about you
is your peculiar ideas about love-making...

418
00:48:06,360 --> 00:48:08,520
...which is no love-making at all.

419
00:48:21,200 --> 00:48:24,200
Oh, Clyde, please, I didn't mean that.

420
00:48:24,520 --> 00:48:28,200
Listen, it, it was just all, all that shooting...

421
00:48:28,520 --> 00:48:32,640
...and all those guns. I got so scared.
Please, honey, I didn't mean it.

Say, peace-maker, I believe you got your
spurs all tangled up there, haven't you?

461
00:52:06,760 --> 00:52:09,360
You're in Missouri,
do you know that, friend?

462
00:52:09,440 --> 00:52:11,400
He's lost, this Texas Ranger.

463
00:52:12,080 --> 00:52:13,120
I don't think he's lost.

464
00:52:13,200 --> 00:52:14,680
Those banks have been offering
extra reward money for us...

465
00:52:14,760 --> 00:52:17,960
...and I think Frank
just figured on some easy pickings.

466
00:52:19,120 --> 00:52:21,520
You know, Texas Ranger,
you ain't hardly doing your job.

467
00:52:21,600 --> 00:52:23,360
You ought to be home
protecting the rights of poor folk...

468
00:52:23,440 --> 00:52:25,360
...not out chasing after us.

469
00:52:31,280 --> 00:52:33,360
Why do you want to take it
so personal for?

470
00:52:33,440 --> 00:52:37,960
Well, all right, we've got to discourage
this bounty hunting for the Barrow Gang.

471
00:52:40,640 --> 00:52:42,720
What do you want
to do with him then, huh?

472
00:52:42,800 --> 00:52:43,920
Shoot him?

473
00:52:48,960 --> 00:52:50,120
Hang him.

474
00:52:50,480 --> 00:52:52,640
Uh-uh. Take his picture.

475
00:52:55,960 --> 00:52:57,880
Listen, we take his picture...

476
00:52:57,960 --> 00:52:59,720
...we send it to all the newspapers.

477
00:52:59,800 --> 00:53:01,880
And then everybody's going to
see Captain Frank Hamer...

478
00:53:01,960 --> 00:53:03,720
...of the Texas Rangers
with the Barrow Gang...

479
00:53:03,800 --> 00:53:06,360
...and all of us just as friendly as pie.

480
00:53:07,160 --> 00:53:11,520
Now you know, we are just about the
friendliest folks you'd ever want to meet.

481
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:16,000
Big old Texas Ranger waves his gun at us...

482
00:53:16,840 --> 00:53:20,320
...and we just welcome him
like he was one of our own.

483
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:23,760
Hey, Buck, get the Kodak.

484
00:53:31,480 --> 00:53:34,600
Now see what came of your mischief,
not doing your job?

485
00:53:34,840 --> 00:53:37,440
You know, down in Duncanville last year...

486
00:53:37,520 --> 00:53:40,800
...poor farmers kept you laws
away from us with shotguns.

487
00:53:41,200 --> 00:53:42,320
You're supposed to be
protecting them from us...

488
00:53:42,400 --> 00:53:44,440
...and they're protecting us from you.

489
00:53:44,520 --> 00:53:46,480
That don't make sense, do it?

490
00:53:51,040 --> 00:53:52,920
Get right in there!

491
00:53:53,880 --> 00:53:57,600
When his Texas Ranger friends see this,
he's going to wish he was dead.

492
00:53:57,680 --> 00:54:01,160
Well, I'm mighty proud to have
a Texas Ranger in the family.

493
00:54:03,720 --> 00:54:05,040
How's this?

494
00:54:39,920 --> 00:54:43,440
We're going to put that picture
in every paper in the country!
