00:00:20,005 --> 00:00:22,415
"We shall not cease from exploration

2
00:00:22,505 --> 00:00:25,465
and the end of all our exploring
will be to arrive where we started

3
00:00:25,545 --> 00:00:28,505
and know the place for the first time."
- T.S. Eliot, "Little Gidding"

4
00:00:28,585 --> 00:00:34,505
"After the game is before the game."
- S. Herberger

5
00:01:51,925 --> 00:01:54,215
<i>Man, </i>

6
00:01:54,335 --> 00:01:58,505
<i>probably the most mysterious species</i>
<i>on our planet. </i>

7
00:01:58,675 --> 00:02:01,795
<i>A mystery of unanswered questions. </i>

8
00:02:01,925 --> 00:02:05,755
<i>Who are we? Where do we come from? </i>

9
00:02:05,925 --> 00:02:11,335
<i>Where are we going? </i>
<i>How do we know what we think we know? </i>

10
00:02:12,255 --> 00:02:15,795
<i>Why do we believe anything at all? </i>

11
00:02:15,965 --> 00:02:19,925
<i>Countless questions in search of an answer, </i>

12
00:02:20,045 --> 00:02:25,045
<i>an answer that will give rise</i>
<i>to a new question, </i>

13
00:02:25,135 --> 00:02:30,885
<i>and the next answer will give rise</i>
<i>to the next question and so on. </i>

14
00:02:32,295 --> 00:02:37,095
<i>But, in the end, </i>
<i>isn't it always the same question? </i>

15
00:02:37,335 --> 00:02:41,795
<i>And always the same answer? </i>

16
00:02:43,545 --> 00:02:49,045
The ball is round.
The game lasts 90 minutes. That's a fact.

17
00:02:49,135 --> 00:02:51,545
Everything else is pure theory.

18
00:02:52,755 --> 00:02:53,835
Here we go!

19
00:03:00,755 --> 00:03:03,045
RUN LOLA RUN

20
00:04:48,925 --> 00:04:50,335
- Manni?
- Lola.

21
00:04:50,415 --> 00:04:52,585
What's up? Where are you?

22
00:04:53,095 --> 00:04:55,465
Where were you, damn it?

23
00:04:55,545 --> 00:05:00,335
- I got there too late.
- But why today? You're always on time!

24
00:05:00,415 --> 00:05:03,755
My moped got ripped off. It doesn't matter.

25
00:05:03,835 --> 00:05:05,295
Yes, it matters!

26
00:05:05,925 --> 00:05:07,375
What's wrong?

27
00:05:08,505 --> 00:05:12,505
It wasn't my fault, Manni.
I went to get some cigarettes.

28
00:05:12,585 --> 00:05:15,135
<i>I can't believe how fast that guy was. </i>

29
00:05:15,715 --> 00:05:18,255
<i>There was nothing I could do. </i>
<i>He was gone before I got outside. </i>

30
00:05:18,335 --> 00:05:20,095
<i>I even took a taxi. </i>

31
00:05:20,295 --> 00:05:24,795
<i>That dumbass drove east. </i>
<i>They got a Grunewald Street there, too. </i>

32
00:05:24,885 --> 00:05:26,545
<i>When I noticed, it was too late. </i>

33
00:05:26,625 --> 00:05:30,885
<i>It just didn't occur to me. </i>
<i>I was so screwed up because of our moped. </i>

34
00:05:30,965 --> 00:05:33,675
<i>- Doesn't matter. </i>
<i>- And when I got there, you were gone. </i>

35
00:05:34,505 --> 00:05:37,215
It doesn't matter now anyway. I'm done for.

36
00:05:37,295 --> 00:05:40,215
- But why?
- Help me, Lola!

37
00:05:40,415 --> 00:05:42,965
<i>I don't know what to do. </i>

38
00:05:43,795 --> 00:05:46,095
You weren't there, and I messed it up.

39
00:05:46,175 --> 00:05:48,585
<i>I blew it. I'm such a jerk! </i>

40
00:05:49,135 --> 00:05:52,295
<i>Just calm down. Now what happened? </i>

41
00:05:52,505 --> 00:05:55,755
<i>Just tell me what happened, okay? </i>

42
00:05:55,835 --> 00:05:59,175
Lola, he's gonna kill me. I'm gonna die.

43
00:05:59,255 --> 00:06:01,795
Stop it! You're scaring me. What's up?

44
00:06:02,045 --> 00:06:05,925
<i>- Did you get caught? </i>
- No, but that would've been something.

45
00:06:06,505 --> 00:06:10,795
<i>Everything went really great. We drove</i>
<i>the cars there, and those guys came. </i>

46
00:06:11,335 --> 00:06:14,295
<i>They paid, and that was it. Easy as pie. </i>

47
00:06:14,375 --> 00:06:18,965
<i>I got waved across the border, </i>
<i>and then they dropped me off out there. </i>

48
00:06:19,045 --> 00:06:23,005
<i>Then I went to see that cyclops, </i>
<i>and he was finished in no time. </i>

49
00:06:23,095 --> 00:06:26,675
<i>And everything was on time, except for you. </i>

50
00:06:26,925 --> 00:06:28,835
<i>You weren't there. </i>

51
00:06:31,175 --> 00:06:34,415
- Then what?
- Nothing. Not even a phone booth.

52
00:06:34,505 --> 00:06:38,095
<i>I couldn't even call a taxi, </i>
<i>so I walked to the subway station. </i>

53
00:06:38,175 --> 00:06:41,415
<i>On the train, there was this bum</i>

54
00:06:41,505 --> 00:06:44,215
<i>who somehow fell down, </i>
<i>and suddenly these inspectors showed up. </i>

55
00:06:45,625 --> 00:06:48,335
<i>And I got out like always, an old reflex. </i>

56
00:07:00,335 --> 00:07:06,045
- The bag!
- The bag.

57
00:07:35,625 --> 00:07:37,005
The bag!

58
00:07:37,965 --> 00:07:41,675
I'm such a fucking amateur! A dumbass!

59
00:07:41,755 --> 00:07:46,545
<i>This could only happen to me! If you'd</i>
<i>picked me up, it wouldn't have happened. </i>

60
00:07:46,625 --> 00:07:49,505
<i>I was so out of it. </i>
<i>You're always on time otherwise! </i>

61
00:07:49,585 --> 00:07:52,465
<i>- Didn't you call the next station? </i>
<i>- Sure. </i>

62
00:07:52,545 --> 00:07:55,465
<i>But it was too late. </i>
<i>The fucking bag was already gone. </i>

63
00:07:55,545 --> 00:07:58,715
<i>And I know who has it. That bum! </i>
<i>That plastic-bag freak! </i>

64
00:07:58,795 --> 00:08:01,585
<i>He's on a plane to Florida or Hawaii</i>

65
00:08:01,675 --> 00:08:05,755
<i>or Canada or Hong Kong</i>
<i>or Bermuda or whatever. </i>

66
00:08:09,295 --> 00:08:11,715
- What about Ronnie?
<i>- He'll kill me. </i>

67
00:08:11,795 --> 00:08:14,005
- You gotta tell him.
- Forget it!

68
00:08:14,095 --> 00:08:16,375
- Why?
- He won't believe a single word.

69
00:08:16,465 --> 00:08:20,585
<i>I kept a carton of cigarettes once. </i>
<i>He noticed right away. </i>

70
00:08:21,135 --> 00:08:22,295
<i>He doesn't believe anybody. </i>

71
00:08:22,375 --> 00:08:26,965
The jobs with those mercs was a kind of test

72
00:08:27,965 --> 00:08:30,135
<i>to see if he could trust me. </i>

73
00:08:32,335 --> 00:08:34,795
How much was there, in the bag?

74
00:08:35,465 --> 00:08:38,175
- 100,000.
- What?

75
00:08:39,255 --> 00:08:43,175
- 100,000. A test.
- Oh, shit!

76
00:08:43,255 --> 00:08:46,045
<i>See! I knew you wouldn't come up</i>
<i>with any idea. </i>

77
00:08:46,135 --> 00:08:49,415
I always said someday
you wouldn't know what to do.

78
00:08:49,505 --> 00:08:51,415
Not when you die, sooner!

79
00:08:51,505 --> 00:08:54,135
You said, "Love can do everything."

80
00:08:54,215 --> 00:08:57,415
- So find 100,000 marks in 20 minutes.
- 20 minutes?

81
00:08:57,505 --> 00:09:01,415
At 12:00 by the water tower
around the corner, Ronnie said.

82
00:09:01,505 --> 00:09:03,295
<i>- In 20 minutes. </i>
- Run away, Manni!

83
00:09:03,375 --> 00:09:05,255
- No.
- Why not?

84
00:09:05,675 --> 00:09:09,625
- Nobody escapes Ronnie.
- I'll go with you.

85
00:09:09,885 --> 00:09:13,175
When Ronnie gets here in 20 minutes,
I'll be a goner.

86
00:09:13,255 --> 00:09:14,255
Stop it, Manni!

87
00:09:14,335 --> 00:09:17,885
What for? You can't get me 100 grand either!

88
00:09:17,925 --> 00:09:22,135
He'll rub me out, and all that's
left of me will be 100,000 ashes

89
00:09:22,215 --> 00:09:25,545
floating down the Spree to the North Sea,
and no more Manni!

90
00:09:25,625 --> 00:09:28,885
- You can't do a thing!
- Shut up!

91
00:09:38,545 --> 00:09:39,755
Listen.

92
00:09:39,835 --> 00:09:44,505
Wait for me. I'll help you.
Stay put. I'll be there in 20 minutes.

93
00:09:44,585 --> 00:09:46,885
<i>- Okay? </i>
- Gonna pawn all your jewelry?

94
00:09:46,965 --> 00:09:47,965
Where are you?

95
00:09:49,095 --> 00:09:53,045
In a phone booth, downtown,
in front of the Spirale Bar.

96
00:09:53,755 --> 00:09:56,585
<i>Okay, stay where you are. </i>
<i>I promise I'll come up with something. </i>

97
00:09:56,675 --> 00:09:58,135
In 20 minutes, okay?

98
00:09:59,925 --> 00:10:03,005
What the hell. I'll go over to the Bolle
and get that 100 grand.

99
00:10:03,095 --> 00:10:04,175
Cut it out!

100
00:10:04,255 --> 00:10:07,885
Ronnie said they make 200 grand a day,
so they must have 100 grand by noon.

101
00:10:08,135 --> 00:10:12,095
<i>You're nuts! Don't do a thing! </i>
<i>Just stay in the damned booth! I'm coming. </i>

102
00:10:12,545 --> 00:10:15,465
- That's it. I'll rob the store.
- Are you cracked?

103
00:10:15,545 --> 00:10:19,545
- Don't do a thing! Stay put! I'm coming.
- Then what?

104
00:10:19,625 --> 00:10:21,095
I'll think of something!

105
00:10:21,175 --> 00:10:24,295
In 20 minutes I'll be dead
unless I steal the money!

106
00:10:24,375 --> 00:10:26,335
- No, wait!
- What for?

107
00:10:26,415 --> 00:10:29,465
I'll get the money somehow.

108
00:10:32,675 --> 00:10:34,755
I'm going in there at 12:00 if you aren't here.

109
00:11:01,925 --> 00:11:08,135
Okay! Who? Who?

110
00:11:42,135 --> 00:11:43,415
Dad!

111
00:11:51,335 --> 00:11:54,415
Lola, are you going shopping?
I need shampoo.

112
00:11:57,005 --> 00:12:00,215
Of course, I knew that Sagittarius
was your ascendant.

113
00:12:00,295 --> 00:12:04,625
Sure, the more I think about it, I don't know.

114
00:12:06,585 --> 00:12:09,375
Yeah, but you're married too.

115
00:13:03,925 --> 00:13:07,095
Hey! Get your eyes open!

116
00:13:10,135 --> 00:13:11,505
You bitch.

117
00:13:11,585 --> 00:13:12,585
AND
THEN

118
00:14:17,415 --> 00:14:20,295
It's worst at night.

119
00:14:20,375 --> 00:14:23,215
I wake up and can't fall asleep again.

120
00:14:23,295 --> 00:14:26,095
And then I'm afraid.

121
00:14:26,175 --> 00:14:28,255
Me! Afraid of the dark.

122
00:14:29,335 --> 00:14:32,795
I've never been afraid of the dark.
I've never been afraid before.

123
00:14:35,175 --> 00:14:37,135
But I think about us,

124
00:14:40,295 --> 00:14:43,465
and I just think it'll keep going on like this.

125
00:14:44,755 --> 00:14:47,005
And you wouldn't dare...

126
00:14:57,175 --> 00:14:59,925
And then I ask myself what I'm doing here.

127
00:15:00,005 --> 00:15:05,465
How long will this go on?
The secrecy, all this damned lying?

128
00:15:06,335 --> 00:15:11,415
Should I grow old, waiting for a man
who won't stand by me?

129
00:15:48,465 --> 00:15:50,415
Hey! You need a bike?

130
00:15:52,255 --> 00:15:54,545
Fifty marks, as good as new.

131
00:15:55,135 --> 00:15:56,585
No.

132
00:16:47,625 --> 00:16:50,795
Hey, man, I know that!

133
00:16:50,885 --> 00:16:53,465
It's not my fault it's so much money!

134
00:16:58,505 --> 00:17:01,415
500? What am I supposed to do
with 500 marks?

135
00:17:17,375 --> 00:17:19,005
Thanks.

136
00:17:30,625 --> 00:17:32,005
Your phone card!

137
00:17:52,835 --> 00:17:56,045
I have to go. Meyer will be here in a minute.

138
00:18:00,545 --> 00:18:02,925
Can we meet later on?

139
00:18:04,135 --> 00:18:06,885
- Do you love me?
- What?

140
00:18:06,965 --> 00:18:09,045
Do you love me?

141
00:18:09,135 --> 00:18:11,255
Why are you asking now?

142
00:18:11,335 --> 00:18:13,795
Do you love me?

143
00:18:13,885 --> 00:18:16,045
Yes, I do, damn it!

144
00:18:17,045 --> 00:18:19,135
Then decide.

145
00:18:19,215 --> 00:18:20,715
But not now!

146
00:18:21,295 --> 00:18:23,585
You have to decide sometime.

147
00:18:23,675 --> 00:18:26,505
But why now, here, at once?

148
00:18:32,925 --> 00:18:34,755
Because I'm pregnant.

149
00:18:44,175 --> 00:18:49,755
Hey, look at that. Our little princess, Lola!
What a rare pleasure.

150
00:18:50,965 --> 00:18:53,295
- Why the rush?
- Please, let me in.

151
00:18:53,715 --> 00:18:57,925
Little Miss wants to see Big Daddy?
Sure thing.

152
00:19:10,045 --> 00:19:11,755
Sorry.

153
00:19:22,135 --> 00:19:26,255
Tell me, do you want
to have a baby with me?

154
00:19:31,005 --> 00:19:32,545
Yes.

155
00:19:36,095 --> 00:19:37,465
Lola?

156
00:19:37,545 --> 00:19:39,135
Dad.

157
00:19:39,215 --> 00:19:41,045
Your daughter?

158
00:19:47,505 --> 00:19:50,215
I'm Jutta Hansen
from the board of directors.

159
00:19:50,295 --> 00:19:52,835
Sorry to interrupt. It's urgent.

160
00:19:52,925 --> 00:19:55,625
It's okay. I was just about to...

161
00:19:57,135 --> 00:20:00,175
- What are you doing here?
- What are you doing here?

162
00:20:04,675 --> 00:20:06,005
Nothing.

163
00:20:14,675 --> 00:20:19,095
Listen, if I tell you I need your help

164
00:20:19,175 --> 00:20:23,835
more than ever in my whole life, and
you're the only one who can help me,

165
00:20:23,925 --> 00:20:25,045
would you help me?

166
00:20:25,135 --> 00:20:27,045
- You look terrible.
- Would you help me?

167
00:20:27,135 --> 00:20:30,965
- What happened?
- I can't explain now. Would you help me?

168
00:20:31,045 --> 00:20:32,925
With what, damn it?

169
00:20:33,715 --> 00:20:36,755
- I need 100,000 marks immediately.
- What?

170
00:20:36,835 --> 00:20:40,835
I need it within the next five minutes,
or else...

171
00:20:40,925 --> 00:20:43,335
- Or else what?
- Something terrible will happen!

172
00:20:44,175 --> 00:20:46,715
I don't understand.
What's going on here today?

173
00:20:46,795 --> 00:20:49,625
Please, Dad! You gotta help me! Please!

174
00:20:49,715 --> 00:20:53,045
- I don't have 100,000 marks.
- What about my life insurance?

175
00:20:53,135 --> 00:20:56,095
What about it? It isn't worth 100,000.

176
00:20:56,175 --> 00:20:59,885
Please, Dad. I'm serious. This isn't a joke.

177
00:20:59,965 --> 00:21:04,585
- Yes, it is, Lola! You can't be serious!
- If you don't help me, he'll die!

178
00:21:04,675 --> 00:21:06,375
- Who'll die?
- Manni.

179
00:21:06,465 --> 00:21:08,005
Who's Manni?

180
00:21:08,095 --> 00:21:10,175
My boyfriend, for over a year!

181
00:21:10,255 --> 00:21:14,095
- I don't even know him. Why will he die?
- It doesn't matter!

182
00:21:21,505 --> 00:21:24,295
Okay, come with me.

183
00:21:33,675 --> 00:21:36,175
- Are you going to help me?
- Of course.

184
00:21:36,255 --> 00:21:38,755
Go home and go to bed.

185
00:21:38,835 --> 00:21:43,755
And tell your mother I won't be home
today or tomorrow or ever again.

186
00:21:43,835 --> 00:21:47,375
I'm leaving you guys
and marrying another woman.

187
00:21:48,415 --> 00:21:53,045
We're going to have kids, and I'll try
to be happy because she wants me.

188
00:21:53,135 --> 00:21:58,505
I'm so sick of hearing, "All you do
is work. You always play the boss."

189
00:21:58,585 --> 00:22:02,585
Maybe so, but so what?
You guys have no idea!

190
00:22:02,675 --> 00:22:06,215
I'm so tired of being the fool,
the one to blame!

191
00:22:06,295 --> 00:22:10,965
But Daddy's dough is good enough, huh?
Well, not anymore!

192
00:22:14,625 --> 00:22:18,375
Anyway, I'd never have fathered
a weirdo like you.

193
00:22:18,465 --> 00:22:21,295
- But you did, you jerk!
- No, I didn't!

194
00:22:24,675 --> 00:22:27,215
All I'm saying is you're a cuckoo's egg.

195
00:22:34,545 --> 00:22:36,005
Now you know.

196
00:22:38,005 --> 00:22:41,505
The guy who fathered you
didn't live to see your birth.

197
00:22:43,885 --> 00:22:45,335
Throw her out, please.

198
00:22:47,885 --> 00:22:50,175
Come on! Get her out of here!

199
00:23:23,045 --> 00:23:25,465
Well, we all have our bad days.

200
00:23:28,545 --> 00:23:30,335
See you around.

201
00:23:43,215 --> 00:23:44,965
My dear,

202
00:23:45,045 --> 00:23:47,095
what's wrong?

203
00:23:47,925 --> 00:23:50,175
Do you have the time?

204
00:24:31,795 --> 00:24:33,585
This afternoon?

205
00:24:35,675 --> 00:24:38,135
All right. No, forget it.

206
00:24:38,215 --> 00:24:41,135
It's okay. Yeah.

207
00:26:15,375 --> 00:26:16,965
<i>Wait! </i>

208
00:26:18,045 --> 00:26:19,965
<i>Don't do it! </i>

209
00:26:20,045 --> 00:26:21,965
<i>Manni, please! </i>

210
00:26:22,045 --> 00:26:25,255
<i>Wait for me! </i>

211
00:26:26,465 --> 00:26:28,755
<i>I'll be right there. </i>

212
00:26:28,835 --> 00:26:30,795
<i>Please. </i>

213
00:26:30,885 --> 00:26:34,135
<i>Manni, please, wait! </i>

214
00:26:54,925 --> 00:26:57,505
Manni!

215
00:27:15,045 --> 00:27:16,545
Okay.

216
00:27:18,045 --> 00:27:19,045
Okay.

217
00:27:20,255 --> 00:27:22,625
Lie down on the floor!

218
00:27:23,885 --> 00:27:25,335
On the floor!

219
00:27:31,215 --> 00:27:33,465
Hands behind your head and keep quiet!

220
00:27:34,505 --> 00:27:36,255
Hands behind your head and keep quiet.

221
00:27:36,335 --> 00:27:41,135
Open the cash registers!
Open all the cash registers!

222
00:27:43,795 --> 00:27:48,135
Open them and lie down!
I'll shoot anybody who bugs me!

223
00:27:49,835 --> 00:27:52,255
I'll shoot anybody who bugs me!

224
00:27:54,255 --> 00:27:55,925
Manni!

225
00:27:57,795 --> 00:28:01,585
- Lola, where were you?
- I couldn't get here faster.

226
00:28:02,175 --> 00:28:05,375
- Will you help me?
- Can't we just get out of here?

227
00:28:06,255 --> 00:28:08,215
Not anymore. You see the shit I'm in.

228
00:28:10,255 --> 00:28:12,335
Why didn't you wait for me?

229
00:28:12,415 --> 00:28:15,585
I did. You got here too late.

230
00:28:15,675 --> 00:28:17,885
So, are you with me?

231
00:28:17,965 --> 00:28:21,135
Put your hands up! Fast!

232
00:28:25,755 --> 00:28:26,835
Come on!

233
00:28:31,175 --> 00:28:33,715
Drop your gun! Hurry up!

234
00:28:40,835 --> 00:28:42,045
Don't move.

235
00:28:42,755 --> 00:28:44,175
The safety catch is on.

236
00:28:44,255 --> 00:28:47,095
- How does it work?
- The little lever on the side.

237
00:28:47,175 --> 00:28:50,795
Girl, listen...

238
00:28:54,715 --> 00:28:56,625
Don't move.

239
00:28:59,215 --> 00:29:00,835
Come here.

240
00:29:05,545 --> 00:29:07,885
Cover me. I'll grab the cash.

241
00:29:21,045 --> 00:29:23,255
Hurry, before the cops come.

242
00:30:16,505 --> 00:30:18,175
Don't move!

243
00:31:48,175 --> 00:31:49,585
Manni?

244
00:31:53,885 --> 00:31:55,795
Do you love me?

245
00:31:58,215 --> 00:31:59,795
Sure, I do.

246
00:32:03,045 --> 00:32:05,465
How can you be so sure?

247
00:32:06,505 --> 00:32:09,415
I don't know. I just am.

248
00:32:10,675 --> 00:32:12,885
I could be some other girl.

249
00:32:15,625 --> 00:32:17,255
Why not?

250
00:32:18,925 --> 00:32:21,005
Because you're the best.

251
00:32:21,095 --> 00:32:23,925
- The best what?
- The best girl.

252
00:32:25,505 --> 00:32:27,415
Of all the girls in the world?

253
00:32:28,585 --> 00:32:29,925
Sure.

254
00:32:30,835 --> 00:32:32,415
How do you know?

255
00:32:33,715 --> 00:32:35,715
I just do.

256
00:32:37,545 --> 00:32:40,045
You think so.

257
00:32:40,135 --> 00:32:42,625
Okay, I think so.

258
00:32:43,885 --> 00:32:46,215
- You see?
- What?

259
00:32:46,295 --> 00:32:47,925
You aren't sure.

260
00:32:49,005 --> 00:32:51,415
Are you nuts or what?

261
00:32:57,135 --> 00:32:59,795
What if you never met me?

262
00:33:01,005 --> 00:33:02,965
What do you mean?

263
00:33:05,045 --> 00:33:07,465
You'd be telling the same thing
to someone else.

264
00:33:07,545 --> 00:33:10,255
Okay, if you don't want to hear it.

265
00:33:10,335 --> 00:33:13,375
I don't want to hear anything.
I want to know how you feel.

266
00:33:14,135 --> 00:33:17,545
Okay, my feelings say

267
00:33:20,095 --> 00:33:21,625
that you're the best.

268
00:33:22,545 --> 00:33:26,215
Who is "your feelings" anyway?

269
00:33:26,295 --> 00:33:27,925
It's me.

270
00:33:30,675 --> 00:33:31,965
My heart.

271
00:33:32,045 --> 00:33:34,755
Your heart says, "Hi, Manni. She's the one."

272
00:33:36,215 --> 00:33:38,415
- Exactly.
- And you say,

273
00:33:38,505 --> 00:33:41,505
"Thanks for the information.
See you around."

274
00:33:41,585 --> 00:33:43,585
Exactly.

275
00:33:43,675 --> 00:33:46,415
And you do whatever your heart says?

276
00:33:46,505 --> 00:33:48,545
Well, it really doesn't "say" anything.

277
00:33:49,625 --> 00:33:51,215
I don't know.

278
00:33:53,175 --> 00:33:54,795
It just feels.

279
00:33:55,675 --> 00:33:57,925
So what does it feel now?

280
00:33:58,005 --> 00:34:00,295
That someone's asking
rather stupid questions.

281
00:34:00,625 --> 00:34:04,415
Man, you aren't taking me seriously.

282
00:34:04,675 --> 00:34:06,675
Lola, what's wrong?

283
00:34:07,675 --> 00:34:11,755
You want to leave me?

284
00:34:14,465 --> 00:34:16,375
I don't know.

285
00:34:20,505 --> 00:34:22,795
I think I have to make a decision.

286
00:34:35,215 --> 00:34:39,095
But I don't want to. I don't want to leave.

287
00:34:46,755 --> 00:34:48,045
Stop.

288
00:34:54,545 --> 00:34:57,215
Lola, are you going shopping?
I need shampoo.

289
00:35:00,175 --> 00:35:03,415
Of course, I knew that Sagittarius
was your ascendant.

290
00:35:03,505 --> 00:35:07,795
Sure, the more I think about it, I don't know.

291
00:35:09,755 --> 00:35:12,545
Yeah, but you're married too.

292
00:36:21,335 --> 00:36:23,465
Watch out, you stupid cow!

293
00:36:25,175 --> 00:36:26,885
Fucking bitch!

294
00:37:35,255 --> 00:37:38,545
- Hey! You need a bike?
- No.

295
00:37:38,625 --> 00:37:41,545
- 50 marks, as good as new.
- But it's stolen!

296
00:37:55,925 --> 00:37:58,625
500? What am I supposed
to do with 500 marks?

297
00:38:38,465 --> 00:38:40,965
Tell me, do you want
to have a baby with me?

298
00:38:46,465 --> 00:38:48,045
Yes.

299
00:38:58,415 --> 00:39:01,375
Even if it isn't from you?

300
00:39:05,965 --> 00:39:08,505
Hey, look at that. Our little princess.

301
00:39:08,585 --> 00:39:10,295
I'm in a hurry, please!

302
00:39:12,135 --> 00:39:13,415
Let me in.

303
00:39:13,505 --> 00:39:16,925
Courtesy and composure
are the queen's jewels.

304
00:39:17,005 --> 00:39:21,415
- Let me in, please.
- A little anger is good for the heart,

305
00:39:21,505 --> 00:39:24,335
the circulation, the skin.

306
00:39:44,135 --> 00:39:49,215
I don't care whether it was an accident
or not! Great start for a new love!

307
00:39:49,295 --> 00:39:51,965
If you hadn't neglected me,
it wouldn't have happened.

308
00:39:52,045 --> 00:39:53,755
I have a family!

309
00:39:53,835 --> 00:39:56,885
I can't leave a sick wife and three kids
just to please Her Highness.

310
00:39:57,415 --> 00:39:59,545
Your wife is drunk from morning to night!

311
00:39:59,625 --> 00:40:02,215
So what? What do you know?

312
00:40:02,925 --> 00:40:05,375
Don't you see you're bothering us?

313
00:40:07,415 --> 00:40:08,835
Lola?

314
00:40:10,045 --> 00:40:11,415
Hi, Dad.

315
00:40:12,175 --> 00:40:13,925
Why didn't you knock?

316
00:40:15,415 --> 00:40:16,885
What's going on?

317
00:40:16,965 --> 00:40:20,335
- What do you want?
- Is she your daughter?

318
00:40:20,925 --> 00:40:22,545
Shut the door.

319
00:40:27,545 --> 00:40:29,625
What do you want?

320
00:40:29,715 --> 00:40:32,415
- I need your help.
- You see that I'm busy.

321
00:40:32,505 --> 00:40:34,795
- There's no other way.
- Damn it!

322
00:40:34,925 --> 00:40:37,335
Why are you disturbing me right now?

323
00:40:37,415 --> 00:40:39,585
I have a problem, you understand?

324
00:40:43,925 --> 00:40:47,255
- Who's that slut?
- That's none of your business!

325
00:40:56,095 --> 00:40:57,795
Lola, leave.

326
00:40:57,885 --> 00:41:01,255
Go home. Leave me alone.

327
00:41:02,545 --> 00:41:04,095
I can't!

328
00:41:04,175 --> 00:41:05,505
Why not?

329
00:41:06,255 --> 00:41:07,795
I need money.

330
00:41:09,255 --> 00:41:12,925
- Then get a job.
- I will, but I need the money now!

331
00:41:14,505 --> 00:41:18,715
Okay, just so you get out of here.
How much?

332
00:41:18,795 --> 00:41:21,215
No, no. I need lots more.

333
00:41:21,295 --> 00:41:25,465
- What do you mean, "lots more"?
- A whole lot more!

334
00:41:25,545 --> 00:41:29,095
Aren't you ashamed, barging in like this?
Can't you see we're busy?

335
00:41:29,175 --> 00:41:32,255
I don't give a shit, you stupid cow!
I have other problems.

336
00:41:34,715 --> 00:41:36,135
Don't you dare...

337
00:42:05,625 --> 00:42:07,255
What?

338
00:42:23,925 --> 00:42:26,335
Hey! What's up? What's up?

339
00:42:28,505 --> 00:42:31,505
It just isn't your day today. Doesn't matter.

340
00:42:31,585 --> 00:42:33,505
You can't have everything.

341
00:43:11,175 --> 00:43:12,925
Come with me.

342
00:43:15,095 --> 00:43:16,965
Have you gone crazy?

343
00:43:17,045 --> 00:43:20,795
- Think you can do anything you like?
- Shut up! You go first.

344
00:43:20,885 --> 00:43:25,545
Girl, listen.
You don't know how to use that thing.

345
00:43:27,675 --> 00:43:29,715
Let me make a suggestion.

346
00:43:51,885 --> 00:43:53,375
Get away.

347
00:43:56,675 --> 00:43:59,335
- Listen, dear, we can talk it over...
- Fuck off!

348
00:44:13,215 --> 00:44:16,465
- Shit!
- The combination.

349
00:44:19,965 --> 00:44:21,545
Quiet!

350
00:44:23,835 --> 00:44:26,215
Lola, what...

351
00:44:27,545 --> 00:44:29,885
What the heck are you doing?

352
00:44:38,135 --> 00:44:39,215
Open up!

353
00:44:52,505 --> 00:44:56,835
Lola, there are cameras everywhere.
You'll never get out of here.

354
00:44:56,925 --> 00:44:59,625
The police will be here in a second.

355
00:44:59,715 --> 00:45:02,965
You said they always come too late.

356
00:45:03,045 --> 00:45:05,715
Bag it, 100,000.

357
00:45:15,835 --> 00:45:18,095
Come on, little miss.

358
00:45:18,965 --> 00:45:20,585
Leave your daddy alone.

359
00:45:21,505 --> 00:45:24,585
You don't want to hurt anyone, do you?

360
00:45:24,675 --> 00:45:26,175
I don't know.

361
00:45:43,715 --> 00:45:45,625
- I don't have it.
- Why not?

362
00:45:47,375 --> 00:45:49,335
There's only 88,000.

363
00:45:50,545 --> 00:45:53,925
I'll have to get the rest from downstairs.

364
00:45:55,755 --> 00:45:59,175
Okay, get going. Go, go!

365
00:46:00,625 --> 00:46:02,545
Hurry up, man!

366
00:46:59,545 --> 00:47:01,135
100,000.

367
00:47:04,795 --> 00:47:06,375
In there.

368
00:47:34,465 --> 00:47:36,375
Bye, Dad.

369
00:47:56,505 --> 00:47:58,835
I don't believe it.

370
00:48:07,505 --> 00:48:09,415
Hey, girl. Get away.

371
00:48:10,835 --> 00:48:12,505
Get away from there!

372
00:48:20,375 --> 00:48:22,625
Hey, girl, you want to get killed?

373
00:48:28,005 --> 00:48:31,925
<i>Attention! This is the police! </i>

374
00:48:32,005 --> 00:48:36,215
<i>The building is surrounded... </i>

375
00:48:37,505 --> 00:48:40,715
- What a ruckus.
- Do you have the time?

376
00:49:06,175 --> 00:49:07,755
Okay.

377
00:49:13,755 --> 00:49:15,675
Hey, get away!

378
00:49:17,585 --> 00:49:21,135
Give me a lift, will you? Please?

379
00:49:21,545 --> 00:49:23,215
Wait!

380
00:50:29,135 --> 00:50:32,135
<i>Wait, Manni. I'm coming. </i>

381
00:50:32,215 --> 00:50:34,135
<i>I'm almost there. </i>

382
00:50:34,215 --> 00:50:39,835
<i>Wait! I'm gonna make it. </i>

383
00:52:37,835 --> 00:52:39,295
Lola.

384
00:52:41,835 --> 00:52:44,465
What would you do if I died?

385
00:52:45,135 --> 00:52:47,625
- I wouldn't let you die.
- Yeah, well,

386
00:52:48,965 --> 00:52:51,465
what if I were fatally ill?

387
00:52:51,545 --> 00:52:52,885
I'd find a way.

388
00:52:52,965 --> 00:52:57,215
What if I were in a coma,
and the doc said, "One more day"?

389
00:52:57,295 --> 00:53:00,215
I'd throw you into the ocean, shock therapy.

390
00:53:00,295 --> 00:53:03,465
What if I were dead anyway?

391
00:53:05,505 --> 00:53:07,755
- What do you want to hear?
- Come on. Tell me.

392
00:53:09,005 --> 00:53:11,835
I'd go to the Isle of Rügen
and cast your ashes to the wind.

393
00:53:11,925 --> 00:53:13,175
And then?

394
00:53:14,675 --> 00:53:17,095
I don't know. It's a stupid question.

395
00:53:17,175 --> 00:53:21,505
I know what you'd do. You'd forget me.

396
00:53:21,585 --> 00:53:23,175
- No!
- Sure you would.

397
00:53:23,255 --> 00:53:29,005
What else could you do?
Sure, you'd mourn for a few weeks.

398
00:53:29,095 --> 00:53:33,465
Not a bad idea.
And everybody's real compassionate,

399
00:53:33,545 --> 00:53:38,335
and everything's so incredibly sad,
and everyone feels sorry for you.

400
00:53:39,505 --> 00:53:44,175
You can show everyone how strong you
are. "What a great woman," they'll say.

401
00:53:44,255 --> 00:53:47,965
"She really pulls herself together
instead of crying all day."

402
00:53:50,095 --> 00:53:53,675
And all at once this really nice guy
with green eyes shows up.

403
00:53:53,755 --> 00:53:57,135
And he's super sensitive,
listens to you all day.

404
00:53:57,215 --> 00:53:59,135
And you can talk his ear off.

405
00:53:59,885 --> 00:54:02,755
And you can tell him
how tough things are for you,

406
00:54:02,835 --> 00:54:06,585
and that you have to look after yourself
and don't know what's gonna happen,

407
00:54:06,675 --> 00:54:09,885
and blah, blah, blah.

408
00:54:09,965 --> 00:54:14,415
Then you'd hop onto his lap and cross me
off your list. That's how it goes.

409
00:54:15,885 --> 00:54:18,625
- Manni.
- What?

410
00:54:18,715 --> 00:54:20,625
You haven't died yet.

411
00:54:31,005 --> 00:54:32,585
No?

412
00:54:47,585 --> 00:54:50,675
Lola, are you going shopping?
I need shampoo.

413
00:54:53,255 --> 00:54:56,465
Of course, I knew that Sagittarius
was your ascendant.

414
00:54:56,545 --> 00:55:00,835
Sure, the more I think about it, I don't know.

415
00:55:02,795 --> 00:55:05,585
Yeah, but you're married too.

416
00:56:56,795 --> 00:56:59,625
- Watch out!
- Sorry.

417
00:56:59,715 --> 00:57:01,625
I bet you're sorry.

418
00:57:21,675 --> 00:57:23,795
Fries and a sausage.

419
00:57:23,885 --> 00:57:25,965
Give me another one.

420
00:57:29,925 --> 00:57:32,335
I'll be damned.

421
00:57:32,415 --> 00:57:34,835
Life's really crazy sometimes, isn't it?

422
00:57:38,045 --> 00:57:41,095
Come on, kid. I'll buy you a drink.

423
00:57:43,585 --> 00:57:45,175
You need a bike?

424
00:57:46,795 --> 00:57:49,545
A special price, 70 marks.

425
00:58:04,625 --> 00:58:06,465
Lola?

426
00:58:07,755 --> 00:58:09,255
Mr. Meyer?

427
00:58:09,335 --> 00:58:11,175
Is everything okay?

428
00:58:11,675 --> 00:58:13,135
No.

429
00:58:40,885 --> 00:58:44,415
Tell me, do you want
to have a baby with me?

430
00:58:48,045 --> 00:58:49,675
Yes.

431
00:58:53,505 --> 00:58:55,215
<i>Mr. Meyer is here. </i>

432
00:58:56,335 --> 00:58:58,625
- There's something else.
- Not now.

433
00:58:58,715 --> 00:59:01,255
<i>Mr. Meyer asked if he should park, </i>
<i>or if you're coming out. </i>

434
00:59:01,335 --> 00:59:03,215
Coming.

435
00:59:03,505 --> 00:59:06,415
That's the nicest present
you could ever give me.

436
00:59:12,885 --> 00:59:14,835
Can we meet later on?

437
00:59:31,005 --> 00:59:32,925
Hi there.

438
00:59:39,545 --> 00:59:41,505
Hi there, Ms. Jäger.

439
00:59:57,465 --> 00:59:59,585
- Hi there.
- Hello.

440
01:00:08,335 --> 01:00:10,095
Hi.

441
01:00:31,795 --> 01:00:34,415
- Nice to see you.
- Hello, Mr. Meyer.

442
01:00:40,965 --> 01:00:42,465
Dad!

443
01:00:49,795 --> 01:00:51,885
Wait!

444
01:00:53,625 --> 01:00:57,795
You know what?
I just had a strange encounter.

445
01:00:57,885 --> 01:01:00,045
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah, with your daughter.

446
01:01:00,135 --> 01:01:02,715
- With whom?
- Your daughter.

447
01:01:02,795 --> 01:01:04,505
Dad!

448
01:01:06,505 --> 01:01:08,465
Shit! Shit!

449
01:01:24,465 --> 01:01:26,295
You've come at last, dear.

450
01:01:56,465 --> 01:01:57,795
Thanks.

451
01:01:57,885 --> 01:01:59,505
Wait.

452
01:02:27,545 --> 01:02:30,375
So I decided it'd be best
for me not to have kids.

453
01:02:30,465 --> 01:02:33,215
I work so much that they'd never see me.

454
01:02:38,295 --> 01:02:39,545
Watch out!

455
01:03:12,715 --> 01:03:16,175
<i>What can I do? </i>

456
01:03:18,835 --> 01:03:20,755
<i>What can I do? </i>

457
01:03:30,625 --> 01:03:32,135
<i>Come on. </i>

458
01:03:34,505 --> 01:03:35,965
<i>Help me. </i>

459
01:03:37,335 --> 01:03:38,585
<i>Please. </i>

460
01:03:40,835 --> 01:03:42,795
<i>Just this once. </i>

461
01:03:44,795 --> 01:03:47,135
<i>I'll just keep on running, okay? </i>

462
01:03:52,715 --> 01:03:54,545
<i>I'm waiting. </i>

463
01:03:55,755 --> 01:03:58,335
<i>I'm waiting. </i>

464
01:03:58,415 --> 01:04:01,215
<i>I'm waiting. </i>

465
01:04:01,295 --> 01:04:03,625
<i>I'm waiting. </i>

466
01:04:11,295 --> 01:04:12,925
You wanna get killed?

467
01:04:46,675 --> 01:04:49,005
- How does this work?
- You buy chips

468
01:04:49,095 --> 01:04:50,755
- and gamble them away.
- Okay.

469
01:04:54,675 --> 01:04:56,465
You can't go in there like that.

470
01:04:56,545 --> 01:04:57,885
I have to.

471
01:04:59,255 --> 01:05:02,295
Ninety-nine marks, 20. What kind of chips?

472
01:05:02,375 --> 01:05:03,965
One for 100?

473
01:05:05,135 --> 01:05:06,625
You're short.

474
01:05:07,215 --> 01:05:08,545
Please.

475
01:05:44,095 --> 01:05:46,375
Place your bets, please.

476
01:05:54,255 --> 01:05:56,505
Your bets, please.

477
01:06:06,585 --> 01:06:08,545
No more bets.

01:06:16,505 --> 01:06:19,505
Twenty, black, even, pass. No series.

479
01:06:24,835 --> 01:06:26,925
1,500 for black.

480
01:06:33,795 --> 01:06:36,715
One hundred and 400.

481
01:06:39,795 --> 01:06:43,885
Three thousand, five hundred
for 100 marks on 20.

482
01:06:49,095 --> 01:06:51,295
Here you are, 3,500.

483
01:07:04,835 --> 01:07:06,095
Come with me, please.

484
01:07:11,095 --> 01:07:12,835
Just one more game.

485
01:07:21,545 --> 01:07:23,415
Please place your bets.

486
01:08:29,925 --> 01:08:33,755
Twenty, black, even, pass.

487
01:08:40,255 --> 01:08:44,095
Hurry up. I need a plastic bag.

488
01:09:35,965 --> 01:09:37,675
Stop!

489
01:09:56,415 --> 01:09:57,835
That's mine.

490
01:09:57,925 --> 01:10:00,375
I know!

491
01:10:11,795 --> 01:10:13,255
I'm sorry.

492
01:10:14,045 --> 01:10:16,295
And what about me?

493
01:10:20,135 --> 01:10:22,965
At least give me that.

494
01:11:30,965 --> 01:11:33,135
What're you doing here?

495
01:11:57,005 --> 01:12:00,295
- I'll stay with him.
- What?

496
01:12:53,675 --> 01:12:55,625
Okay.

497
01:13:32,005 --> 01:13:33,545
Manni?

498
01:13:48,625 --> 01:13:50,375
Manni?

499
01:15:03,625 --> 01:15:04,625
Hey.

500
01:15:08,545 --> 01:15:10,675
What happened to you?

501
01:15:12,715 --> 01:15:14,335
Did you run here?

502
01:15:16,095 --> 01:15:19,045
Don't worry. Everything's okay. Come on.

503
01:15:27,545 --> 01:15:29,505
What's in the bag?
