00:19:35,257 --> 00:19:36,759
Yes, I would.

462
00:19:36,926 --> 00:19:38,428
<i>So that's the first thing.</i>

463
00:19:38,594 --> 00:19:41,518
<i>And in this situation, either--</i>

464
00:19:41,681 --> 00:19:44,560
<i>and I don't like this--</i>
<i>we drag her downtown.</i>

465
00:19:44,725 --> 00:19:47,274
<i>We book her.</i>
<i>We process her.</i>

466
00:19:47,436 --> 00:19:50,235
<i>We put her in a holding cell,</i>
<i>where she'll probably be all night.</i>

467
00:19:50,398 --> 00:19:52,196
That seems very extreme.

468
00:19:52,358 --> 00:19:55,328
<i>Yeah. I mean, I think in order to</i>
<i>keep this sort of contained,</i>

469
00:19:55,486 --> 00:19:59,957
<i>what we could do is just have you</i>
<i>strip-search her right now.</i>

470
00:20:00,991 --> 00:20:02,789
<i>Would just be easier and quicker, I think.</i>

471
00:20:06,372 --> 00:20:07,294
Gee, I don't know if--

472
00:20:07,456 --> 00:20:09,299
I don't know if I'm comfortable with that.

473
00:20:09,458 --> 00:20:11,256
<i>Yeah, I know, but her story</i>
<i>doesn't jibe, see?</i>

474
00:20:11,419 --> 00:20:13,171
<i>- You know, I mean--</i>
<i>- I know, but it means</i>

475
00:20:13,337 --> 00:20:15,214
<i>we have to put her into the system,</i>
<i>you know?</i>

476
00:20:17,091 --> 00:20:19,935
<i>Look, I understand you not wanting</i>
<i>to get involved, but...</i>

477
00:20:20,094 --> 00:20:21,812
[sighs] Gee, I'm not sure...

478
00:20:21,971 --> 00:20:23,769
<i>In my experience,</i>
<i>it could be a very big deal.</i>

479
00:20:23,931 --> 00:20:25,103
...to be honest.

480
00:20:25,266 --> 00:20:27,815
<i>Yeah, well, a trial</i>
<i>can drag on a long time.</i>

481
00:20:27,977 --> 00:20:30,275
<i>There's a direct cost to her</i>
<i>being taken in.</i>

482
00:20:30,438 --> 00:20:32,236
- Sandra...
- Yeah. Um...

483
00:20:32,398 --> 00:20:34,526
<i>federal conviction rate is over 90 %.</i>

484
00:20:35,192 --> 00:20:36,660
<i>You know, she seems like a nice person.</i>

485
00:20:36,819 --> 00:20:37,866
Yeah.

486
00:20:38,028 --> 00:20:39,496
<i>If there's any doubt, you know,</i>

487
00:20:39,655 --> 00:20:42,750
<i>having you do it there</i>
<i>could be a big help to her.</i>

488
00:20:42,908 --> 00:20:44,376
Yeah. I mean, it seems--
I'm not--

489
00:20:45,077 --> 00:20:47,000
<i>I don't want you to worry about this part,</i>

490
00:20:47,163 --> 00:20:50,542
<i>because I have to take the full,</i>
<i>final responsibility for this,</i>

491
00:20:50,708 --> 00:20:53,552
<i>and I do, and I take that</i>
<i>very seriously.</i>

492
00:20:53,711 --> 00:20:55,588
<i>So take that off your shoulders.</i>

493
00:20:55,755 --> 00:20:56,972
Um...

494
00:20:59,049 --> 00:21:01,097
Okay.
Just--Just a second.

495
00:21:03,012 --> 00:21:04,013
He's saying that...

496
00:21:05,222 --> 00:21:08,977
[sighs] that he will have
to take you down to jail

497
00:21:09,143 --> 00:21:12,738
and that, most likely,
you'll have to spend the night,

498
00:21:12,897 --> 00:21:15,070
or I could, um--

499
00:21:15,232 --> 00:21:17,405
I could strip-search you here.

500
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:19,487
What? No.

501
00:21:19,904 --> 00:21:21,497
No.

502
00:21:22,490 --> 00:21:23,366
No way.

503
00:21:23,532 --> 00:21:25,705
<i>Just tell her that it's gonna be quicker</i>
<i>if you strip-search her.</i>

504
00:21:25,868 --> 00:21:27,415
This'll all be over quicker.

505
00:21:27,995 --> 00:21:28,962
SANDRA:
'Cause if we go to the jail...

506
00:21:29,121 --> 00:21:33,297
Beck, if we go to the jail,
it just takes much longer.

507
00:21:35,044 --> 00:21:38,799
This is so stupid.
I didn't do anything at all.

508
00:21:38,964 --> 00:21:40,181
<i>What did she say?</i>

509
00:21:40,841 --> 00:21:42,138
Um...

510
00:21:42,301 --> 00:21:44,724
<i>It? either that or take her to jail</i>
<i>and hold her overnight, okay?</i>

511
00:21:44,887 --> 00:21:46,889
Hold on. So, honey,
what do you want to do?

512
00:21:48,974 --> 00:21:50,692
I mean, what--
what do you mean?

513
00:21:50,851 --> 00:21:52,569
What I mean is it looks like

514
00:21:52,728 --> 00:21:54,901
we're either gonna have
to go down to the jail--

515
00:21:55,064 --> 00:21:56,532
<i>we don't have much of a choice--</i>

516
00:21:56,690 --> 00:21:58,658
or, you know, I can do it here,

517
00:21:58,818 --> 00:22:02,698
which I think is really much,
much easier for you. Don't you?

518
00:22:07,284 --> 00:22:08,661
<i>Okay'</i>

519
00:22:08,828 --> 00:22:11,126
- Okay.
- Okay. You want me to search you...

520
00:22:11,288 --> 00:22:13,666
BECKY: Search. Yeah, search.
Okay, search. God.

521
00:22:13,833 --> 00:22:16,256
So we'll--
we'll just do that really quickly.

522
00:22:16,418 --> 00:22:19,342
I'll get Marti in here,
and we'll do it really quick, okay?

523
00:22:19,505 --> 00:22:20,757
<i>She say yes?</i>

524
00:22:20,923 --> 00:22:22,470
Yeah, can you just bring Marti in here?

525
00:22:23,092 --> 00:22:27,472
Yeah. She is saying yes, but I think I need
to get my shift supervisor in here, right?

526
00:22:27,638 --> 00:22:29,436
<i>Well, it'd be best not</i>
<i>to have her actually.</i>

527
00:22:29,598 --> 00:22:32,021
<i>It's faster for everyone</i>
<i>the quicker it can happen.</i>

528
00:22:32,184 --> 00:22:33,811
Yeah, but she's asking for Marti,

529
00:22:33,978 --> 00:22:35,901
and I think in situations like this,

530
00:22:36,063 --> 00:22:39,408
corporate would insist on having
two supervisors present. I mean...

531
00:22:39,567 --> 00:22:41,740
<i>Oka--Oh, corporate does?</i>

532
00:22:41,902 --> 00:22:45,372
Yeah. Well, I mean,
what does Robbie think?

533
00:22:45,948 --> 00:22:47,200
<i>What does Robbie think?</i>

534
00:22:47,366 --> 00:22:48,208
Yeah, about--

535
00:22:48,367 --> 00:22:49,289
<i>Oh, oh, Robert?</i>

536
00:22:50,494 --> 00:22:53,213
<i>You know what? I don't know.</i>
<i>Let me ask him. Hold on.</i>

537
00:22:54,957 --> 00:22:56,959
He's talking to Robbie.

538
00:23:01,297 --> 00:23:04,722
- Is Marti up front?
- Oh, she went to the back.

539
00:23:04,884 --> 00:23:06,727
I'm sure Becky didn't have
anything to do with it.

540
00:23:06,886 --> 00:23:07,762
What?

541
00:23:07,928 --> 00:23:09,475
Is this all about the freezer?

542
00:23:09,638 --> 00:23:10,560
No, no, no.

543
00:23:10,723 --> 00:23:13,317
- L-ls everything okay with Becky?
- Not really.

544
00:23:13,475 --> 00:23:16,024
Okay, Marti, I need you
to come with me to the office.

545
00:23:16,186 --> 00:23:17,984
I know we're swamped,
but this is important.

546
00:23:20,858 --> 00:23:21,859
<i>DANIELS:</i>
<i>I know you don't want to do this,</i>

547
00:23:22,026 --> 00:23:23,994
<i>but it's gonna be okay.</i>
<i>It's fine, really.</i>

548
00:23:24,153 --> 00:23:25,826
<i>I've done a million of these,</i>

549
00:23:25,988 --> 00:23:28,707
<i>and, it's fine, you know.</i>
<i>It's not pleasant.</i>

550
00:23:28,866 --> 00:23:30,459
<i>I mean, you don't like it.</i>
<i>I don't like it.</i>

551
00:23:30,618 --> 00:23:35,624
<i>I don't know any guy, as many years</i>
<i>as I've been on the job, enjoys this.</i>

552
00:23:36,248 --> 00:23:38,296
<i>Think about poor Sandra.</i>

553
00:23:40,377 --> 00:23:41,970
Yeah.

554
00:23:42,129 --> 00:23:43,176
<i>You know what, Becky?</i>

555
00:23:43,339 --> 00:23:45,216
<i>You seem like a nice person, honestly.</i>

556
00:23:45,382 --> 00:23:48,761
<i>I, you know, I hate to get</i>
<i>conflicting information like this,</i>

557
00:23:48,928 --> 00:23:50,601
<i>and it's, uh, confusing,</i>

558
00:23:50,763 --> 00:23:53,562
<i>and it bothers me as much</i>
<i>as I'm sure it bothers you, so...</i>

559
00:23:53,724 --> 00:23:54,691
Yes.

560
00:23:54,850 --> 00:23:56,477
<i>I mean, it'd be really helpful</i>

561
00:23:56,644 --> 00:23:58,487
<i>for me and for her, I'm sure,</i>

562
00:23:58,646 --> 00:24:02,116
<i>if you're a good girl</i>
<i>and you make it easy on Sandra.</i>

563
00:24:02,274 --> 00:24:05,448
<i>I just--I need you to be</i>
<i>a good actress for her,</i>

564
00:24:05,611 --> 00:24:09,912
<i>uh, you know, if you could pretend</i>
<i>like it doesn't bother you, okay?</i>

565
00:24:10,074 --> 00:24:11,576
Okay, I mean, it just--

566
00:24:12,284 --> 00:24:15,379
It's really crazy.
I've never done anything like this.

567
00:24:15,537 --> 00:24:18,586
Like, I'm really freaked out.
I--You know what I mean?

568
00:24:18,749 --> 00:24:20,092
I just want it all to be over.

569
00:24:20,250 --> 00:24:21,718
<i>[laughs] No, I don't know what you mean,</i>

570
00:24:21,877 --> 00:24:24,130
<i>because I've never stolen money</i>
<i>while I was at work like you,</i>

571
00:24:24,296 --> 00:24:25,843
<i>because I don't commit crimes.</i>

572
00:24:26,006 --> 00:24:27,223
Well, I haven't done that either.

573
00:24:27,383 --> 00:24:30,887
<i>Listen, Becky, have you ever</i>
<i>been arrested before?</i>

574
00:24:31,053 --> 00:24:32,145
No, of course not.

575
00:24:32,304 --> 00:24:34,557
<i>Then relax! Heh.</i>

576
00:24:34,723 --> 00:24:37,021
<i>We're trying to make sure you're okay.</i>

577
00:24:37,184 --> 00:24:40,028
<i>After she searches you, it'll all be over.</i>

578
00:24:42,690 --> 00:24:46,490
<i>Hey, do you have any older siblings</i>
<i>ever been in trouble with the law?</i>

579
00:24:50,823 --> 00:24:51,699
Do you mean my brother?

580
00:24:51,865 --> 00:24:54,584
<i>Bingo. That's right, your brother.</i>

581
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:59,836
<i>And has your brother told you...</i>
<i>that he's still in trouble?</i>

582
00:24:59,999 --> 00:25:00,875
[door opens]

583
00:25:01,041 --> 00:25:02,543
So now what's happening?

584
00:25:02,710 --> 00:25:05,930
We have to strip-search Becky,
and I wanted you to come in.

585
00:25:06,088 --> 00:25:09,092
Corporate always wants two people
for a strip search, right?

586
00:25:09,258 --> 00:25:10,475
You think she stole something?

587
00:25:10,634 --> 00:25:13,979
I don't know. I didn't find anything,
but it's either this, or she goes to jail.

588
00:25:14,138 --> 00:25:15,811
- Oh, Sandra, but Becky--
- I know,

589
00:25:15,973 --> 00:25:18,522
but I don't know what else we can do.

590
00:25:20,978 --> 00:25:24,152
BECKY: I don't see how that has
anything to do with this at all.

591
00:25:24,314 --> 00:25:26,737
This is so stupid.

592
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:28,618
SANDRA:
Hello, Officer. We're back.

593
00:25:28,777 --> 00:25:32,452
<i>Great. You're really</i>
<i>helping us out here, Sandra.</i>

594
00:25:32,614 --> 00:25:35,242
<i>I was just telling Robert</i>
<i>how lucky we all are you're there.</i>

595
00:25:35,409 --> 00:25:36,752
<i>You're almost like a real cop.</i>

596
00:25:36,910 --> 00:25:39,834
Ha! Well, I'm just trying to do my job.

597
00:25:39,997 --> 00:25:41,670
<i>Well, you're doing perfect.</i>

598
00:25:41,832 --> 00:25:43,379
SANDRA: Thank you.

599
00:25:43,542 --> 00:25:48,924
<i>Okay, so I'm gonna need you</i>
<i>have her strip down now.</i>

600
00:25:49,089 --> 00:25:50,341
<i>Look through everything.</i>

601
00:25:53,719 --> 00:25:54,891
<i>Okay'</i>

602
00:25:56,388 --> 00:25:59,392
Um, he says it's time to--

603
00:26:00,392 --> 00:26:01,985
Let's just try to--

604
00:26:02,144 --> 00:26:04,146
The faster you do it, honey,
the faster we're finished.

605
00:26:12,404 --> 00:26:13,906
Come on.

606
00:26:14,073 --> 00:26:15,165
<i>Okay'</i>

607
00:26:25,626 --> 00:26:27,503
All right.

608
00:26:28,462 --> 00:26:29,714
Your shoes, hon.

609
00:26:47,689 --> 00:26:49,282
SANDRA: Okay.

610
00:26:58,242 --> 00:27:01,041
Okay. I've, um--

611
00:27:01,203 --> 00:27:02,921
I've checked the clothes,

612
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:05,629
and, uh, they're--they're clean.

613
00:27:06,208 --> 00:27:07,209
What do you have?

614
00:27:07,376 --> 00:27:08,218
SANDRA:
Everything's clean.

615
00:27:08,377 --> 00:27:10,630
Um, I have her--

616
00:27:10,796 --> 00:27:12,013
you know, her shirt

617
00:27:12,172 --> 00:27:14,766
and her, uh, undershirt and her shoes

618
00:27:14,925 --> 00:27:18,145
and, uh, her pants, and they're all--

619
00:27:18,303 --> 00:27:20,772
There's nothing in them.

620
00:27:20,931 --> 00:27:24,652
<i>Well, no, it's just that there isn't</i>
<i>anything you're trained to see.</i>

621
00:27:24,810 --> 00:27:28,030
<i>Um, have you checked</i>
<i>her underwear yet?</i>

622
00:27:32,317 --> 00:27:33,614
No, we just, uh...

623
00:27:35,112 --> 00:27:37,285
I just looked--
I just checked her clothes.

624
00:27:37,447 --> 00:27:40,621
<i>Okay. It's gotta be everything.</i>
<i>That's probably what's going on here.</i>

625
00:27:40,784 --> 00:27:44,664
<i>Padded bras can often be</i>
<i>where thieves hide things</i>

626
00:27:44,830 --> 00:27:46,252
<i>and--and panties, of course.</i>

627
00:27:46,415 --> 00:27:49,840
<i>What, uh, style of panties</i>
<i>does she have?</i>

628
00:27:50,002 --> 00:27:51,595
Uh, let's see.

629
00:27:51,753 --> 00:27:55,678
Um, I guess cotton bikini.

630
00:27:55,841 --> 00:27:56,842
<i>Hmm.</i>

631
00:27:59,261 --> 00:28:02,640
<i>Yeah, you're gonna need</i>
<i>to take those off, all of it.</i>

632
00:28:08,478 --> 00:28:09,946
<i>Okay'</i>

633
00:28:13,066 --> 00:28:14,443
He wants you to--

634
00:28:18,363 --> 00:28:21,116
He wants you to take off the--

635
00:28:21,950 --> 00:28:22,951
take off your underwear.

636
00:28:23,118 --> 00:28:24,870
MARTI: No, Sandra, really,
we're taking her underwear off?

637
00:28:25,037 --> 00:28:26,254
Well, he's saying--
He's just saying,

638
00:28:26,413 --> 00:28:29,587
uh, there's padded bras or something,
you can hide stuff in it.

639
00:28:42,512 --> 00:28:43,559
<i>[Scoffs]</i>

640
00:28:50,103 --> 00:28:52,447
You need to take off both.

641
00:28:56,401 --> 00:28:57,573
<i>Okay'</i>

642
00:29:03,742 --> 00:29:06,086
<i>Okay'</i>

643
00:29:06,245 --> 00:29:09,795
Well, this should clear it right up,
and we'll be done with it now.

644
00:29:10,874 --> 00:29:12,876
Okay, I'm--

645
00:29:13,043 --> 00:29:14,795
The clothes are--

646
00:29:14,962 --> 00:29:18,683
just seem fine. Everything...

647
00:29:20,550 --> 00:29:24,180
<i>What about her rear?</i>
<i>Did you make her turn around?</i>

648
00:29:31,144 --> 00:29:33,738
He wants you to turn around.

649
00:29:37,859 --> 00:29:40,203
Okay, she's not hiding anything.

650
00:29:40,779 --> 00:29:45,205
<i>Um, sometimes people sew</i>
<i>secret compartments in their clothes.</i>

651
00:29:45,367 --> 00:29:47,040
<i>You can't see them</i>
<i>unless you're trained for it.</i>

652
00:29:47,202 --> 00:29:50,172
<i>Um, we 'Il just look over it</i>
<i>before we let her go.</i>

653
00:29:50,330 --> 00:29:53,004
<i>Here's what I'm gonna need you to do.</i>
<i>Do you have a car?</i>

654
00:29:53,166 --> 00:29:54,588
Yes.

655
00:29:54,751 --> 00:29:57,379
<i>Okay, I'm gonna need you</i>
<i>to take all the clothes,</i>

656
00:29:57,546 --> 00:30:00,971
<i>along with her purse and cellphone,</i>
<i>and put them all in a bag, okay?</i>

657
00:30:01,133 --> 00:30:03,511
<i>What kind of car do you have?</i>

658
00:30:03,677 --> 00:30:07,181
Um, 2000 Subaru.
Can you get that bag for me?

659
00:30:07,347 --> 00:30:12,194
<i>2000 Subaru. Okay.</i>
<i>All right, put everything in the bag,</i>

660
00:30:12,352 --> 00:30:15,231
<i>and put the bag in the front seat</i>
<i>of your car, and leave it unlocked</i>

661
00:30:15,397 --> 00:30:16,694
<i>so we can inspect it</i>
<i>as soon as we get there.</i>

662
00:30:16,857 --> 00:30:18,859
Well, hang on a minute.
And, uh...

663
00:30:19,860 --> 00:30:21,362
Why--Why would I put it in my car?

664
00:30:21,528 --> 00:30:24,122
I mean, is she supposed
to just stay in here?

665
00:30:24,281 --> 00:30:26,124
I'm just supposed
to stay in here like this?

666
00:30:26,283 --> 00:30:28,206
<i>Yeah, well, hmm.</i>

667
00:30:30,412 --> 00:30:33,086
I'm just not understanding why it has to be
in my car, though. That's the only thing.

668
00:30:33,248 --> 00:30:35,592
<i>Yes, ma'am. I can...</i>
<i>Wait.</i>

669
00:30:35,751 --> 00:30:38,630
Okay, so she's just gonna be in here.

670
00:30:38,795 --> 00:30:40,012
<i>Okay, two reasons:</i>

671
00:30:40,172 --> 00:30:45,429
<i>One, she won't have access to the clothes</i>
<i>to get the money back when you're not looking,</i>

672
00:30:45,594 --> 00:30:47,892
<i>and also then we can check it,</i>
<i>and if it's clean,</i>

673
00:30:48,055 --> 00:30:51,309
<i>we bring her clothes back inside with us</i>
<i>so she doesn't have to, you know,</i>

674
00:30:51,475 --> 00:30:54,103
<i>walk through the restaurant naked</i>
<i>when we escort her out.</i>

675
00:30:54,269 --> 00:30:56,271
<i>Um, it's just--</i>
<i>It's a standard thing.</i>

676
00:30:56,438 --> 00:30:58,281
MARTI: I'll clock you out. Just go,

677
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:00,283
and I'll make sure you get paid
for today, okay?

678
00:31:00,442 --> 00:31:01,284
- SANDRA: Okay.
- Yeah.

679
00:31:01,443 --> 00:31:03,741
Um, they're saying...

680
00:31:04,488 --> 00:31:05,740
that I need to put it in my car

681
00:31:05,906 --> 00:31:08,955
so that when they get here,
they can check the stuff.

682
00:31:09,117 --> 00:31:11,415
Your car? Sandra, when--

683
00:31:11,578 --> 00:31:14,878
They can't give it back to the perpetrator
until they have checked it all.

684
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:18,795
MARTI: But, I mean, that just sound--
I don't know. I don't know.

685
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:22,214
Can I just keep her things
here, um, with her

686
00:31:22,381 --> 00:31:24,224
or up front until you get here?

687
00:31:24,383 --> 00:31:27,762
<i>Well, n--Yeah, yes. Yes, ma 'am.</i>
<i>Uh, I hear you.</i>

688
00:31:27,928 --> 00:31:29,430
I mean, when are you coming?

689
00:31:29,596 --> 00:31:31,644
<i>Uh, all right, look...</i>

690
00:31:32,724 --> 00:31:33,976
<i>We don't normally share this,</i>

691
00:31:34,142 --> 00:31:37,942
<i>but considering the time-sensitive nature</i>
<i>and my needing your help,</i>

692
00:31:38,105 --> 00:31:42,576
<i>I feel like I should explain</i>
<i>the broader investigation of Rebecca.</i>

693
00:31:44,152 --> 00:31:45,449
<i>Okay'</i>

694
00:31:45,612 --> 00:31:48,240
<i>I'm currently investigating</i>
<i>with my team--</i>

695
00:31:48,407 --> 00:31:50,535
<i>I'm investigating her house.</i>

696
00:31:51,785 --> 00:31:52,627
- Her house?
- Yes.

697
00:31:52,786 --> 00:31:54,834
Wait. What about my house?

698
00:31:54,996 --> 00:31:56,498
<i>The thing is, her brother...</i>

699
00:31:56,665 --> 00:31:58,383
Why is she talking about my house?

700
00:31:58,542 --> 00:31:59,964
<i>Is a suspect in an investigation</i>

701
00:32:00,127 --> 00:32:02,300
<i>over growing a large amount</i>
<i>of marijuana.</i>

702
00:32:02,462 --> 00:32:07,684
<i>We believe that Rebecca may have</i>
<i>knowledge and may also be selling.</i>

703
00:32:10,053 --> 00:32:13,102
They're saying that your house,
your brother might have someth--

704
00:32:13,265 --> 00:32:15,518
<i>- No, please, ma'am. Ma'am! Sandra.</i>
- What?

705
00:32:15,684 --> 00:32:17,937
<i>- This is confidential information. Okay?</i>
<i>- Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.</i>

706
00:32:18,103 --> 00:32:20,572
<i>We're hoping that if we can find</i>
<i>the money that she stole,</i>

707
00:32:20,730 --> 00:32:22,198
<i>then we can bring her in</i>

708
00:32:22,357 --> 00:32:24,109
<i>and get a plea confession</i>
<i>in this other situation.</i>

709
00:32:24,276 --> 00:32:26,244
But my brother doesn't even
do anything. This is crazy.

710
00:32:26,403 --> 00:32:27,950
<i>And here's the most important thing.</i>

711
00:32:28,113 --> 00:32:28,955
[Sandra sighs]

712
00:32:29,656 --> 00:32:30,623
<i>Okay'</i>

713
00:32:30,782 --> 00:32:35,162
<i>Her clothes could have forensic proof</i>
<i>of her distributing her brother's stash.</i>

714
00:32:35,328 --> 00:32:37,046
<i>That's why it's important</i>
<i>you take them to the car</i>

715
00:32:37,205 --> 00:32:40,880
<i>so we have time to test them</i>
<i>before taking her away.</i>

716
00:32:41,042 --> 00:32:44,546
<i>If you do this, you will build our case.</i>
<i>You understand?</i>

717
00:32:44,713 --> 00:32:45,714
Yes.

718
00:32:56,391 --> 00:33:00,862
[no audible dialogue]

719
00:33:01,021 --> 00:33:02,364
CONNIE: We don't
have no pickles either.

720
00:33:03,273 --> 00:33:05,025
Sandra! Are you or Marti
gonna come help?

721
00:33:05,192 --> 00:33:06,444
I'm on the register by myself.

722
00:33:06,610 --> 00:33:08,908
Okay, one of us will be right out.

723
00:33:09,070 --> 00:33:11,118
Let me just finish this real quick.

724
00:33:11,281 --> 00:33:12,282
CONNIE:
Oh, my God.

729
00:34:47,836 --> 00:34:50,259
CONNIE: Thank you.

730
00:34:50,422 --> 00:34:51,469
Excuse me, miss.

731
00:34:51,631 --> 00:34:54,805
I bought this sandwich for my daughter
with no pickles and mayo.

732
00:34:54,968 --> 00:34:55,890
It's loaded with mayo.

733
00:34:56,052 --> 00:34:56,974
- Okay.
- It's disgusting.

734
00:34:57,137 --> 00:34:59,640
No problem.
Just give me one second.

735
00:35:05,270 --> 00:35:07,819
I need a southwest ranch, no mayo.

736
00:35:08,064 --> 00:35:09,611
Is everything okay?

737
00:35:09,774 --> 00:35:12,027
Well, what do you think?
First the freezer thing.

738
00:35:12,193 --> 00:35:15,037
Then I tell you we could have
a QC visit from Franchise,

739
00:35:15,196 --> 00:35:17,665
and still we're getting the orders wrong.
Come on, Kevin.

740
00:35:17,824 --> 00:35:19,326
I'm making the sandwich.

741
00:35:25,123 --> 00:35:25,999
MARTI: wright?

742
00:35:26,166 --> 00:35:28,760
Hey, you know Connie's by herself
at the register, right?

743
00:35:28,918 --> 00:35:30,966
And we've got nobody
running food to drive-thru,

744
00:35:31,129 --> 00:35:32,551
and we're completely out of bacon.

745
00:35:32,714 --> 00:35:35,809
Well, I have Julio on drive-thru,
but you're right. It's very hectic,

746
00:35:35,967 --> 00:35:39,562
so why don't you go out now,
and I'm gonna come as soon as I can.

747
00:35:39,721 --> 00:35:40,563
BECKY: Bye.

748
00:35:40,722 --> 00:35:42,395
Hello, Officer.

749
00:35:42,557 --> 00:35:45,356
<i>Uh, did you put the clothes in the car,</i>

750
00:35:45,518 --> 00:35:47,065
<i>the, uh, 2000 Subaru?</i>

751
00:35:47,228 --> 00:35:50,732
Yes, I did. It's in the employee
parking in the back,

752
00:35:50,899 --> 00:35:53,869
and the passenger door is unlocked.

753
00:35:54,611 --> 00:35:55,578
<i>That's good. You're doing great.</i>

754
00:35:55,737 --> 00:35:58,115
<i>Like I said before,</i>
<i>I'm lucky I have you here tonight.</i>

755
00:35:58,281 --> 00:36:00,124
Well, thank you. Heh.

756
00:36:00,283 --> 00:36:02,752
<i>Have you ever been involved</i>
<i>in a situation like this before?</i>

757
00:36:02,911 --> 00:36:04,163
Oh, God, no.

758
00:36:04,329 --> 00:36:06,502
<i>Heh. Well, you could have fooled me.</i>

759
00:36:06,665 --> 00:36:10,340
<i>You're making a really difficult situation</i>
<i>run very smoothly, very professional.</i>

760
00:36:10,502 --> 00:36:12,004
- Thank you so much.
- Sure.

761
00:36:12,170 --> 00:36:14,218
MARTI: Sandra! When we--
When are we doing the drop?

762
00:36:14,381 --> 00:36:15,553
I can't do that and the register.

763
00:36:15,715 --> 00:36:17,262
SANDRA: I'm coming now!

764
00:36:17,425 --> 00:36:19,644
Actually I'm feeling like I need
to get out there

765
00:36:19,803 --> 00:36:22,056
and do the job that Robbie
is paying me to do.

766
00:36:22,222 --> 00:36:23,769
When did you say
you were coming back?

767
00:36:23,932 --> 00:36:25,775
<i>Well, we're just in the middle</i>
<i>of searching the house.</i>

768
00:36:25,934 --> 00:36:27,607
<i>I need you to sit tight with me here.</i>

769
00:36:27,769 --> 00:36:29,112
<i>Do you have a problem doing that?</i>

770
00:36:29,270 --> 00:36:32,023
Well, it's just that I'm needed out front.
This is our busiest time.

771
00:36:32,190 --> 00:36:33,316
<i>Sure, sure.</i>

772
00:36:33,483 --> 00:36:36,282
<i>Uh, really hate to do this to your night.</i>

773
00:36:36,444 --> 00:36:39,698
<i>Do you have an employee</i>
<i>that you trust to watch her,</i>

774
00:36:39,864 --> 00:36:42,242
<i>ideally a male for security reasons?</i>

775
00:36:42,951 --> 00:36:44,373
Um, yeah.

776
00:36:44,536 --> 00:36:45,708
I could get Kevin.

777
00:36:46,705 --> 00:36:50,335
And I could do sandwich board,
and I could get Brie to do the, um,

778
00:36:50,625 --> 00:36:52,377
bags going out. Okay, hold on.

779
00:36:52,544 --> 00:36:55,923
Is--Is this really needed?
I swear I'll be okay. I--

780
00:36:56,089 --> 00:36:59,059
Yes, it is needed,
until we get it figured out.

781
00:36:59,217 --> 00:37:00,093
When are they coming?

782
00:37:00,260 --> 00:37:02,433
I have no idea.

783

785
00:37:09,269 --> 00:37:12,113
Kevin, I need to pull you
from sandwich board.

786
00:37:12,272 --> 00:37:14,400
Julio and Brie, cover for him.

787
00:37:14,566 --> 00:37:16,910
I promise you I'll be right back.

[Pen scratching]

790
00:38:01,237 --> 00:38:03,831
Hey, all right, so what--
what is going on?

791
00:38:03,990 --> 00:38:04,832
[Door closes]

792
00:38:05,575 --> 00:38:07,794
There's some upsetting news
about Becky.

793
00:38:07,952 --> 00:38:09,374
She stole from a customer,

794
00:38:09,537 --> 00:38:11,915
and she may be in trouble
for something with her brother.

795
00:38:12,081 --> 00:38:13,503
He's been in trouble
with the law.

796
00:38:13,666 --> 00:38:15,839
Wait. She stole something?

797
00:38:16,002 --> 00:38:17,345
Yes.

798
00:38:17,504 --> 00:38:19,472
No, I--I know her brother.

799
00:38:19,631 --> 00:38:21,850
He's not in--Wait. What?

800
00:38:22,967 --> 00:38:25,436
I can't talk about it right now.
It's all gonna be sorted out.

801
00:38:25,595 --> 00:38:29,816
What I need you for is to watch Becky
until the police get here.

802
00:38:34,562 --> 00:38:37,156
We had to strip-search her.

803
00:38:40,235 --> 00:38:41,908
Hello, Officer. I'm back.

804
00:38:42,070 --> 00:38:44,198
<i>Hey, how's it going out there?</i>
<i>is it a madhouse?</i>

805
00:38:44,364 --> 00:38:47,117
Oh, yes, you guessed it.
It's a madhouse.

806
00:38:47,283 --> 00:38:49,786
Yes, I'm in the weeds.
That's the word.

807
00:38:49,953 --> 00:38:51,955
Uh, I've gotta get back out there,

808
00:38:52,121 --> 00:38:55,671
but I have Kevin here,
and he's gonna watch Becky.

809
00:38:55,834 --> 00:38:58,303
<i>- Yeah. Put him on now, okay?</i>
<i>- Okay, sure.</i>

810
00:38:58,461 --> 00:39:00,759
Uh, just so you know,
I am gonna come back in

811
00:39:00,922 --> 00:39:02,048
and check--check on things,

812
00:39:02,215 --> 00:39:03,842
make sure everything's all right.

813
00:39:04,008 --> 00:39:05,601
<i>That sounds fair.</i>

814
00:39:07,095 --> 00:39:09,518
<i>You know, you're really being very helpful.</i>

815
00:39:09,681 --> 00:39:12,025
Well, it's no problem.

816
00:39:12,183 --> 00:39:13,810
Urn, so here's Kevin.

817
00:39:13,977 --> 00:39:18,699
This is Officer Daniels.
He'll tell you what to do.

818
00:39:22,652 --> 00:39:24,404
Hey, they're saying that you stole
from a customer

819
00:39:24,571 --> 00:39:25,914
and that your brother is arrested.

820
00:39:26,072 --> 00:39:27,915
- What?
- What did you do?

821
00:39:28,074 --> 00:39:29,121
I didn't--
I didn't do anything.

822
00:39:29,284 --> 00:39:32,003
This is crazy. I'm naked.

823
00:39:35,957 --> 00:39:37,083
Hello.

824
00:39:37,250 --> 00:39:38,797
<i>Is this Kevin?</i>

825
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:40,086
Yeah. Yeah.

826
00:39:40,253 --> 00:39:41,254
Kevin, this is Officer Daniels.

827
00:39:41,421 --> 00:39:43,219
I'm the lead officer in the case.

828
00:39:43,381 --> 00:39:45,224
Has your manager explained what's going on?

829
00:39:45,383 --> 00:39:50,014
<i>Uh, well, she said that Becky stole something</i>
<i>and her brother's arrested.</i>

830
00:39:51,180 --> 00:39:53,182
Sandra told you about her brother?

831
00:39:53,349 --> 00:39:56,068
<i>Yeah--Uh, well, she said he's in trouble.</i>

832
00:39:56,227 --> 00:39:58,070
<i>Well, what did he do?</i>

833
00:39:58,229 --> 00:40:01,233
Yeah, well, we'll get to the brother
in a second.

834
00:40:01,399 --> 00:40:04,027
That's really a very serious police matter.

835
00:40:04,193 --> 00:40:10,542
What we are interested in
in the moment is Becky and this theft.

836
00:40:11,659 --> 00:40:13,707
Oh, and what is the theft?

837
00:40:13,870 --> 00:40:18,717
<i>Well, I have a customer here with me</i>
<i>that says her purse was taken.</i>

838
00:40:18,875 --> 00:40:21,924
Ye--Well, you know,
I was out there the whole time,

839
00:40:22,086 --> 00:40:26,592
and, you know, I didn't see anyone
complain about a purse being stolen.

840
00:40:27,175 --> 00:40:29,052
<i>Yeah, no, I'm sorry.</i>
<i>You're right. Excuse me.</i>

841
00:40:29,218 --> 00:40:31,437
Not her purse.
Uh, money from her purse.

842
00:40:31,596 --> 00:40:32,973
She says that, uh, Becky--

843
00:40:33,139 --> 00:40:35,016
It was on the counter, the purse,

844
00:40:35,183 --> 00:40:37,732
and Becky stuck her hand in
and snatched it out.

845
00:40:37,894 --> 00:40:40,568
<i>Okay, I don't understand</i>
<i>how that could be possible,</i>

846
00:40:40,730 --> 00:40:43,449
because there were, like,
a ton of people out there.

847
00:40:43,608 --> 00:40:46,782
Well, I don't really have the time
to debate it with you, son.

848
00:40:46,945 --> 00:40:50,700
<i>I have a surveillance unit saying</i>
<i>they can corroborate the victim's story.</i>

849
00:40:50,865 --> 00:40:53,539
<i>What our issue at hand is,</i>
<i>where is the money?</i>

850
00:40:53,701 --> 00:40:54,748
<i>You see?</i>

851
00:40:54,911 --> 00:40:57,881
<i>Does she have anything</i>
<i>in her pockets?</i>

852
00:41:00,375 --> 00:41:02,343
What?

853
00:41:02,502 --> 00:41:05,301
<i>What is the suspect</i>
<i>wearing at this time?</i>

854
00:41:07,924 --> 00:41:12,475
I--You know, she doesn't really have
pockets to have anything in.

855
00:41:12,637 --> 00:41:13,980
<i>And why is that?</i>

856
00:41:16,391 --> 00:41:18,769
<i>Dude, you all strip-searched her.</i>

857
00:41:18,935 --> 00:41:20,608
<i>She's wearing an apron right now.</i>

858
00:41:20,770 --> 00:41:22,443
Okay. Why don't you calm down?

859
00:41:22,605 --> 00:41:24,699
I'm gonna need you to inspect her.

860
00:41:24,857 --> 00:41:27,781
[laughs]
What?

861
00:41:27,944 --> 00:41:30,948
<i>Kevin, why don't you stop laughing,</i>
<i>and calm down, okay?</i>

862
00:41:31,114 --> 00:41:33,162
W-What the fuck are you talking about?

863
00:41:33,324 --> 00:41:35,793
<i>I am an officer of the law, okay?</i>

864
00:41:35,952 --> 00:41:39,627
<i>I'm gonna need you to address me</i>
<i>as a sir, understand?</i>

865
00:41:42,083 --> 00:41:44,006
<i>All right, Kevin...</i>

866
00:41:44,502 --> 00:41:46,675
<i>we need to find this money.</i>

867
00:41:47,755 --> 00:41:50,884
<i>I'm gonna need to have her</i>
<i>remove the apron,</i>

868
00:41:51,050 --> 00:41:53,269
<i>and you search her body.</i>

869
00:41:59,350 --> 00:42:00,977
<i>KEVIN: He's trying to get me--</i>

870
00:42:01,144 --> 00:42:04,398
He's saying he wants me
to get you to take off the apron

871
00:42:04,564 --> 00:42:06,942
and inspect your whole body.

872
00:42:11,070 --> 00:42:12,037
I already did--

873
00:42:12,780 --> 00:42:13,702
I already did that.
That's--

874
00:42:13,865 --> 00:42:15,367
Yeah, bro, this is fucked.

875
00:42:15,533 --> 00:42:16,659
I'm sorry.

876
00:42:16,826 --> 00:42:19,329
<i>It might seem a little strange, I know,</i>

877
00:42:19,495 --> 00:42:21,418
<i>but I'm still an officer of the law.</i>

878
00:42:21,581 --> 00:42:24,460
You need to listen to me
for your own sake.

879
00:42:24,625 --> 00:42:25,751
This is procedure.

880
00:42:25,918 --> 00:42:28,421
Yeah, well, it's a fucked procedure.

881
00:42:28,588 --> 00:42:31,057
Okay, you need to watch your mouth, son.

882
00:42:31,215 --> 00:42:33,809
Uh, sorry.

883
00:42:34,343 --> 00:42:37,392
Look, I gotta--
I gotta leave in a second.

884
00:42:37,555 --> 00:42:39,978
Okay, but let me ask you one more thing.
Were you two ever an item?

885
00:42:40,141 --> 00:42:42,360
Wha...

886
00:42:43,394 --> 00:42:44,566
SANDRA: What are you doing?

887
00:42:44,729 --> 00:42:46,857
You can't make me do that shit.

888
00:42:47,023 --> 00:42:48,696
Talk to me. Come on.

889
00:42:51,694 --> 00:42:53,037
Look, I'm not saying it was me
with the freezer,

890
00:42:53,196 --> 00:42:54,573
but I admit that's my responsibility,

891
00:42:54,739 --> 00:42:56,116
but that--that is not my job.

892
00:42:56,282 --> 00:42:58,580
Jesus, Kevin, can I not count
on you for anything?

893
00:42:58,743 --> 00:43:00,871
Becky is my friend.
When the cops come,

894
00:43:01,037 --> 00:43:03,335
I don't want anything to do with it.

895
00:43:08,878 --> 00:43:12,223
- What the hell happened?
- He didn't think it was fair.

896
00:43:14,926 --> 00:43:16,178
SANDRA: Hello.

897
00:43:16,344 --> 00:43:18,517
<i>Sandra, this isn't working out with Kevin.</i>

898
00:43:18,679 --> 00:43:22,775
<i>I do not approve of him</i>
<i>as the main security before I arrive.</i>

899
00:43:22,934 --> 00:43:24,106
What happened?

900
00:43:24,268 --> 00:43:25,611
<i>Well, nothing good.</i>

901
00:43:25,770 --> 00:43:28,148
<i>He's completely disobedient</i>
<i>and unprofessional.</i>

902
00:43:28,314 --> 00:43:29,907
Well, he's always like that.

903
00:43:30,066 --> 00:43:33,661
Is he? You have to put up with
a lot of stuff from him, huh?

904
00:43:33,820 --> 00:43:36,289
<i>Well, I mean, he's fine.</i>
<i>I mean, he's a good kid.</i>

905
00:43:36,447 --> 00:43:39,747
<i>You know, he %--he% fine. Just--</i>
<i>[laughs] It%--</i>

906
00:43:39,909 --> 00:43:42,037
Should I have my people
start watching him?

907
00:43:42,286 --> 00:43:44,084
<i>You think he could be wrapped up</i>
<i>in the same stuff Becky is?</i>

908
00:43:44,247 --> 00:43:48,377
Oh, goodness, no. No, no, no.
Nothing like that, no.

909
00:43:48,543 --> 00:43:50,386
<i>But he gives you hell, huh?</i>

910
00:43:50,545 --> 00:43:52,764
Yeah, he does,
like you can't imagine.

911
00:43:52,922 --> 00:43:56,017
<i>Ha ha! I'm sorry.</i>
<i>It must be a real pain.</i>

912
00:43:56,175 --> 00:44:02,353
Oh, hey, listen. Kevin said
that you told him about Becky's brother

913
00:44:02,515 --> 00:44:04,563
even though I said it was confidential.

914
00:44:06,519 --> 00:44:08,567
Oh, you know, I don't--Hmm.

915
00:44:09,438 --> 00:44:11,190
I don't think I said much, though, did I?

916
00:44:11,357 --> 00:44:13,155
<i>- You know, the last thing I need--</i>
- I may have mentioned it.

917
00:44:13,317 --> 00:44:14,569
The last thing I need

918
00:44:14,735 --> 00:44:17,534
<i>is someone on my side</i>
<i>with a big mouth, Sandra.</i>

919
00:44:17,697 --> 00:44:19,199
<i>You know what I mean?</i>

920
00:44:19,365 --> 00:44:21,083
<i>If you can't cooperate with me here--</i>

921
00:44:21,242 --> 00:44:22,118
I'm sorry.

922
00:44:22,285 --> 00:44:24,208
<i>I need to be able to trust you.</i>

923
00:44:24,370 --> 00:44:25,587
Right.

924
00:44:26,164 --> 00:44:27,006
I'm very sorry...

925
00:44:27,165 --> 00:44:29,042
<i>- Just be quiet.</i>
- ...you know.

926
00:44:29,208 --> 00:44:33,213
Either you need to watch her,
or we need to find someone reliable.

927
00:44:33,379 --> 00:44:39,512
<i>Um, yeah, I could watch her,</i>
<i>but the thing is, it's so busy out there.</i>

928
00:44:39,677 --> 00:44:42,055
No, no, no, I know.
You have a restaurant to run.

929
00:44:42,221 --> 00:44:44,315
- We've asked too much of you already.
- Yeah.

930
00:44:44,891 --> 00:44:49,067
Just wish I could spare one flippin' officer,
just someone to run over.

931
00:44:49,228 --> 00:44:50,400
<i>Yeah, can't you, or--</i>

932
00:44:50,563 --> 00:44:51,564
Unfortunately, no.

933
00:44:51,731 --> 00:44:54,484
<i>It has to be someone new</i>
<i>on your end.</i>

934
00:44:54,650 --> 00:44:57,620
Oh. Well, um, you know,

935
00:44:57,778 --> 00:45:01,157
I could get Marti, but, see,
Marti's needed out there, too.

936
00:45:01,324 --> 00:45:02,701
<i>- Right, right, right.</i>
<i>- You know?</i>

937
00:45:02,867 --> 00:45:05,040
<i>Well, let me ask you a question.</i>

938
00:45:05,203 --> 00:45:06,580
<i>Are you married?</i>

939
00:45:06,746 --> 00:45:10,842
Uh, no, but I'm--
Heh. I'm gonna be soon.

940
00:45:12,001 --> 00:45:13,253
You're engaged?

941
00:45:13,419 --> 00:45:15,012
Yeah, I am.

942
00:45:15,171 --> 00:45:17,173
<i>Oh, well, that's great. Congrats.</i>

943
00:45:17,340 --> 00:45:18,387
Well, thanks, yeah.

944
00:45:18,549 --> 00:45:19,675
<i>Terrific. Ha ha!</i>

945
00:45:19,842 --> 00:45:22,721
Well, do you trust him?

946
00:45:22,887 --> 00:45:24,560
<i>Yes, of course.</i>

947
00:45:24,722 --> 00:45:26,895
[dog barks outside]
Well, what's he up to?

948
00:45:27,058 --> 00:45:28,901
You think he could come by and help?

949
00:45:31,646 --> 00:45:33,364
Um...

950
00:45:34,523 --> 00:45:36,025
Gee, uh...

951
00:45:36,192 --> 00:45:37,193
<i>Do you think--</i>

952
00:45:37,360 --> 00:45:40,614
Yeah, it's a little unstandard,
I know. Jeez.

953
00:45:40,780 --> 00:45:42,578
But it'd really help me out.

954
00:45:42,740 --> 00:45:43,582
<i>Yeah.</i>

955
00:45:43,741 --> 00:45:45,835
It would help you. Okay.

956
00:45:45,993 --> 00:45:48,371
Uh, well, I would have to call him,

957
00:45:48,537 --> 00:45:50,756
and I would just have to see if he,

958
00:45:50,915 --> 00:45:53,759
<i>you know, could come.</i>

959
00:45:53,918 --> 00:45:55,044
[dog barks]
Great.

960
00:45:55,211 --> 00:45:56,929
Why don't you do that for me, then?

961
00:46:00,549 --> 00:46:01,801

[laughter echoing]

964
00:46:39,630 --> 00:46:43,635
So the officer's name is Daniels,
and we're just waiting on them.

965
00:46:43,801 --> 00:46:45,849
So who is it again?

966
00:46:46,012 --> 00:46:47,229
Are you drunk?

967
00:46:47,388 --> 00:46:48,685
No.

968
00:46:48,848 --> 00:46:51,442
I already told you it's Becky from the front.

969
00:46:51,600 --> 00:46:53,318
That little blonde girl?

970
00:46:53,477 --> 00:46:54,945
Yeah.

971
00:47:01,068 --> 00:47:04,038
Becky? You remember Van, don't you?

972
00:47:04,196 --> 00:47:05,243
BECKY: Yeah. Hey.

973
00:47:05,406 --> 00:47:07,079
- VAN: Hey.
- Well, he's gonna sit with you

974
00:47:07,241 --> 00:47:09,539
until they come, okay?

975
00:47:09,702 --> 00:47:11,875
Do we really have to do this?

976
00:47:12,747 --> 00:47:14,624
Honey, it's not up to me.

977
00:47:14,790 --> 00:47:15,666
Hello, Officer?

978
00:47:15,833 --> 00:47:17,460
- Yeah.
- I have Van here,

979
00:47:17,626 --> 00:47:19,879
and I'm gonna hand the phone
over to him,

980
00:47:20,046 --> 00:47:22,424
and then I'm gonna get back
out there, okay?

981
00:47:22,590 --> 00:47:23,637
<i>That'd be great.</i>

982
00:47:23,799 --> 00:47:24,971
Okay, here he is.

983
00:47:25,134 --> 00:47:26,135
Here's--Here's Van.

984
00:47:29,221 --> 00:47:30,143
Hello.

985
00:47:30,306 --> 00:47:31,523
Hello. Who's this?

986
00:47:31,682 --> 00:47:33,605
<i>This is Evan Balcer.</i>

987
00:47:33,768 --> 00:47:38,274
Evan Balcer, A-L-C-E-R?

988
00:47:38,439 --> 00:47:40,282
Do you want a Diet Coke, hon?
Diet Coke?

989
00:47:40,441 --> 00:47:42,239
<i>- Sandra, how much longer?</i>
<i>- You're what, her boyfriend?</i>

990
00:47:42,401 --> 00:47:43,323
- VAN: Yeah.
- SANDRA: Honey, I don't know.

991
00:47:43,486 --> 00:47:44,658
<i>- Do you have a date?</i>
<i>- VAN: Not really, no.</i>

992
00:47:44,820 --> 00:47:45,992
What do you want to drink?

993
00:47:46,155 --> 00:47:47,657
<i>All right, Evan,</i>
<i>you got a real fine lady...</i>

994
00:47:47,823 --> 00:47:49,075
- Diet Coke is okay.
- ...in Sandra there.

995
00:47:49,241 --> 00:47:50,868
Thanks.

996
00:47:51,035 --> 00:47:52,537
<i>Yeah. So what do you do?</i>

997
00:47:52,703 --> 00:47:54,000
<i>Y-You're a general contractor?</i>

998
00:47:54,163 --> 00:47:55,380
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

999
00:47:55,748 --> 00:47:57,375
You don't work at the ChickWich?

1000
00:47:57,541 --> 00:47:58,793
- No.
- Not even part-time?

1001
00:47:58,959 --> 00:48:00,802
- Nah.
- [laughs]

1002
00:48:00,961 --> 00:48:02,679
<i>And, uh, what was</i>
<i>your whereabouts tonight?</i>

1003
00:48:02,838 --> 00:48:03,714
What were you doing?

1004
00:48:03,881 --> 00:48:05,428
Uh, it was a long day at work,

1005
00:48:05,591 --> 00:48:08,765
so I just hung out with some buddies
at their--their house, you know.

1006
00:48:08,928 --> 00:48:10,521
<i>Oh, man, you got dragged in here, huh?</i>

1007
00:48:10,679 --> 00:48:11,805
I did, yeah. [laughs]

1008
00:48:11,972 --> 00:48:15,351
<i>Well, get used to it. That's the way</i>
<i>it's gonna be once you get married.</i>

1009
00:48:15,518 --> 00:48:16,986
They never let you out.

1010
00:48:17,144 --> 00:48:19,693
All right, Evan.

1011
00:48:20,731 --> 00:48:23,450
You ready to do this? She fill you in
on everything we need to do here?

1012
00:48:23,609 --> 00:48:24,906
Not really, no.

1013
00:48:25,069 --> 00:48:27,117
She, uh, she said I just
had to sit here and wait.

1014
00:48:27,279 --> 00:48:29,953
<i>Well, I bet she told you</i>
<i>Becky stole money.</i>

1015
00:48:30,116 --> 00:48:31,083
Pardon me?

1016
00:48:31,242 --> 00:48:32,915
<i>She told you Becky stole the money?</i>

1017
00:48:33,077 --> 00:48:33,919
Right.

1018
00:48:34,078 --> 00:48:35,671
<i>BOY-</i>

1019

Well, I'm in charge of the crime scene
and everything that happens here,

1020
00:48:40,167 --> 00:48:42,215
and you're gonna assist me, okay?

1021
00:48:43,212 --> 00:48:45,431
I--I guess so. [chuckles]

1022
00:48:45,589 --> 00:48:46,556
<i>Okay'</i>

1023
00:48:46,715 --> 00:48:50,345
And the first thing we need to do
is find that money she took.

<i>Okay'</i>

1025
00:48:52,138 --> 00:48:53,890
<i>I'm gonna need you to inspect her.</i>

1026
00:48:54,056 --> 00:48:56,275
<i>Does she still have that apron on?</i>

1027
00:48:56,851 --> 00:48:58,398
Yep.

1028
00:48:59,437 --> 00:49:01,155
Yeah, why don't we start by...

1029
00:49:01,564 --> 00:49:03,111
having her take that off.

1030
00:49:05,818 --> 00:49:06,910
<i>[chuckles]</i>

00:49:12,992 --> 00:49:13,959
What?

1033
00:49:14,118 --> 00:49:14,960
<i>Oh, and, Evan,</i>

1034
00:49:15,119 --> 00:49:19,215
if she won't take it off I'm gonna
need you to take it from her.

1035
00:49:19,373 --> 00:49:21,091
We gotta find the money that you took.

1036
00:49:21,250 --> 00:49:23,594
Someone else already
made me take it off.

1037
00:49:23,752 --> 00:49:24,878
I'm naked. The--

<i>Did she-Has she taken it off yet?</i>

1040
00:49:29,049 --> 00:49:33,429
No. She said somebody already asked her
and that she doesn't have the money.

1041
00:49:33,846 --> 00:49:35,439
She's naked.

[Daniels laughs]

You believe everything a thief says?

1044
00:49:39,643 --> 00:49:40,610
Evan, you're a grown man.

1045
00:49:40,769 --> 00:49:43,488
You think a naked girl doesn't
have a place to hide money?

1051
00:49:55,075 --> 00:49:56,167
can't we have Marti come back here?

1052
00:49:56,327 --> 00:49:59,957
Honey, why are you making this
more difficult than it has to be?

1053
00:50:00,122 --> 00:50:02,295
Can you hold on a second, Officer?

1054

All right.

1055
00:50:06,253 --> 00:50:08,301
Is this okay to be doing?

What do you mean?

I don't know. It--I don't get it.

Well, yeah, of course.

Yeah.

Jesus, Van.

How many beers have you had?

1065

00:50:32,488 --> 00:50:36,413
<i>Oh, he's doing great, just really great,</i>
<i>almost as sweet and helpful as you.</i>

1070
00:50:36,575 --> 00:50:38,373
[laughs]
Uh, so he's better than Kevin.

1071
00:50:38,536 --> 00:50:39,708
- He's, uh--
- Oh, yeah.

1072
00:50:39,870 --> 00:50:41,213
Yeah. He's not giving you any trouble?

1073
00:50:41,372 --> 00:50:43,795
No, no, no.
We were doing just great.

1074
00:50:43,958 --> 00:50:44,925
<i>Okay, great.</i>

1075
00:50:45,084 --> 00:50:47,963
Well, then, I'm gonna go ahead
and hand the phone back to Van,

1076
00:50:48,128 --> 00:50:49,755
and I'm gonna get back out there.

1077
00:50:49,922 --> 00:50:51,299
<i>- Okay, you do that.</i>
<i>- Okay.</i>

1078
00:50:59,640 --> 00:51:00,482
Yeah, this is Van.

1079
00:51:00,641 --> 00:51:01,813
BECKY: Can't just, like, you or Marti--

1080
00:51:01,976 --> 00:51:03,398
Can I come sit with you guys out there...

1081
00:51:03,561 --> 00:51:04,983
<i>- Is Sandra still there?</i>
<i>- Yeah.</i>

1082
00:51:05,145 --> 00:51:06,738
...where I can wait or something
in the employee area?

1083
00:51:06,897 --> 00:51:09,025
Well, honey, what are you gonna do,
walk through the dining room?

1084
00:51:09,191 --> 00:51:10,613
<i>She's talking to Becky or...?</i>

1085
00:51:10,776 --> 00:51:12,494
- This isn't going to go on much longer.
- Yeah.

1086
00:51:12,653 --> 00:51:15,657
Here. Have something to drink, okay?
You'll be all right?

1087
00:51:15,823 --> 00:51:18,167
<i>Yeah. Well, you know,</i>
<i>these are sensitive matters.</i>

1088
00:51:18,325 --> 00:51:20,419
<i>It's probably better</i>
<i>to let them talk about it</i>

1089
00:51:20,578 --> 00:51:23,798
<i>before we, uh,</i>
<i>do what we need to do here.</i>

1090
00:51:25,791 --> 00:51:27,634
[door closes]
- Okay.

1091
00:51:28,794 --> 00:51:31,092
Is Sandra still there?

1092
00:51:31,255 --> 00:51:33,303
<i>Y-Yeah, she left.</i>

1093
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:36,598
Is she coming back any time soon?

1094
00:51:37,511 --> 00:51:38,933
I don't know.

1095
00:51:39,888 --> 00:51:41,890
- I don't think so.
- 'Kay.

1096
00:51:42,057 --> 00:51:44,230
Then you need
to tell Becky to take it off.

1097
00:51:44,893 --> 00:51:47,066
And, look, I work with
troubled teens all the time.

1098
00:51:47,229 --> 00:51:48,230
There's usually some resistance,

1099
00:51:48,397 --> 00:51:51,617
<i>but... usually they just want to help.</i>

1100
00:51:51,775 --> 00:51:54,028
<i>They want to do the right thing, so just--</i>

1101
00:51:54,194 --> 00:51:56,288
<i>This is what works.</i>
<i>Be stern with her.</i>

1102
00:51:56,447 --> 00:51:58,290
Don't give her a choice.

1103
00:51:58,449 --> 00:51:59,621
Go ahead.

1104
00:52:03,120 --> 00:52:05,043
Please, don't. This is craz--

1105
00:52:05,205 --> 00:52:06,798
Just don't make me do this.

1106
00:52:06,957 --> 00:52:07,879
This is crazy.

1107
00:52:08,042 --> 00:52:10,716
<i>Let me talk to Becky.</i>

1108
00:52:11,670 --> 00:52:13,013
He wants to talk to you.

1109
00:52:17,343 --> 00:52:18,686
BECKY: Hello.

1110
00:52:20,054 --> 00:52:22,898
So I want you to do me a favor

1111
00:52:23,057 --> 00:52:25,401
and look around at where you are.

1112
00:52:26,894 --> 00:52:28,896
That's where you are.

1113
00:52:31,190 --> 00:52:33,784
<i>Where we are is at your house,</i>

1114
00:52:33,942 --> 00:52:36,445
<i>searching it for your brother's drugs.</i>

1115
00:52:37,488 --> 00:52:38,580
My brother doesn't do drugs.

1116
00:52:38,739 --> 00:52:41,083
<i>Enough. Enough.</i>

1117
00:52:41,700 --> 00:52:43,293
<i>Shut up.</i>

1118
00:52:45,537 --> 00:52:48,757
We have you with witnesses
stealing from the restaurant.

1119
00:52:48,916 --> 00:52:50,543
You aren't cooperating.

1120
00:52:50,709 --> 00:52:53,963
You aren't helping us
conduct our investigation.

1121
00:52:54,129 --> 00:52:55,722
It's not good.

1122
00:52:59,677 --> 00:53:02,226
All right, looks like
we're gonna have to take you in.

1123
00:53:06,141 --> 00:53:07,643
<i>They'll look at your criminal record,</i>

1124
00:53:08,394 --> 00:53:11,318
<i>determine how many hours</i>
<i>you're gonna spend there in the jail.</i>

1125
00:53:11,480 --> 00:53:13,482
I don't have a criminal record.

1126
00:53:14,608 --> 00:53:19,364
I'm just saying they'll look
at your criminal record or lack of,

1127
00:53:19,530 --> 00:53:21,749
look at your papers,

1128
00:53:22,574 --> 00:53:25,748
decide how many hours
you'll spend in jail. Okay?

1129
00:53:31,291 --> 00:53:33,214
<i>I mean, they are gonna haul you in.</i>

1130
00:53:33,377 --> 00:53:36,847
<i>They'll look at how you</i>
<i>cooperated here, today.</i>

1131
00:53:37,005 --> 00:53:39,679
<i>I mean, all this is being recorded.</i>

1132
00:53:40,426 --> 00:53:41,598
<i>You understand?</i>

1133
00:53:51,687 --> 00:53:53,064
[sighs]

1134
00:53:53,230 --> 00:53:55,574
Yeah, I understand.

1135
00:53:56,358 --> 00:53:57,359
<i>Mm-hmm.</i>

1136
00:53:57,526 --> 00:54:01,076
But, sir, why?

1137
00:54:02,656 --> 00:54:05,660
<i>Why? Why are you going to jail?</i>

1138
00:54:06,326 --> 00:54:09,170
<i>Because you're the one</i>
<i>that's causing all the problems.</i>

1139
00:54:11,206 --> 00:54:17,430
<i>Now, if you want this over with</i>
<i>sooner rather than later,</i>

1140
00:54:18,213 --> 00:54:21,808
<i>you'll allow the person that I authorized</i>

1141
00:54:21,967 --> 00:54:25,016
to inspect you, to search you.

1142
00:54:25,179 --> 00:54:26,772
And then, maybe then...

1143
00:54:28,557 --> 00:54:30,685
you'll have a chance of getting out of this.

1144
00:54:37,649 --> 00:54:39,117
You understand what I'm saying?

1145
00:54:39,276 --> 00:54:41,699
You can go to jail,
or you can let this guy inspect you.

1146
00:54:41,862 --> 00:54:44,331
You can go to jail, or you can
let this guy inspect you.

1147
00:54:44,490 --> 00:54:46,709
That's it, two choices.

1148
00:54:50,954 --> 00:54:51,955
<i>- You're gonna do this?</i>
<i>- Okay.</i>

1149
00:54:52,122 --> 00:54:53,749
You're gonna take off the apron?

1150
00:54:56,877 --> 00:54:58,550
Yeah.

1151
00:54:58,712 --> 00:55:00,305
You're gonna take it off?

1152
00:55:01,799 --> 00:55:03,142
Yes.

1153
00:55:03,300 --> 00:55:05,598
Great. Thank you.

1154
00:55:06,678 --> 00:55:08,351
You're doing great.

1155
00:55:09,306 --> 00:55:12,560
So just take off the apron
and give the phone back to Van, okay?

1156
00:55:25,739 --> 00:55:26,911
This is Van.

1157
00:55:27,074 --> 00:55:29,042
<i>How'd that work?</i>
<i>She take off the apron?</i>

1158
00:55:29,868 --> 00:55:31,415
She is now.

1159
00:55:33,247 --> 00:55:35,625
<i>Well, what does her chest look like?</i>

1160
00:55:37,209 --> 00:55:41,259
Well, she's covering it with the apron.

1161
00:55:42,214 --> 00:55:45,434
<i>I thought you said she took it off.</i>
<i>Take it from her.</i>

1162
00:55:50,389 --> 00:55:53,689
He says I gotta take the apron from you.

1163
00:56:07,531 --> 00:56:09,625
<i>How big are her nipples?</i>

1164
00:56:11,785 --> 00:56:13,708
<i>[scoffs]</i>

1165
00:56:13,871 --> 00:56:15,839
Why? I mean--

1166
00:56:15,998 --> 00:56:17,841
<i>You're my eyes on the ground.</i>

1167
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:20,298
<i>Anything that can corroborate</i>
<i>the witness' testimony.</i>

1168
00:56:20,460 --> 00:56:23,509
<i>I just need to know</i>
<i>any identifying marks, scars, tattoos.</i>

1169
00:56:23,672 --> 00:56:25,674
Yeah, but--

1170
00:56:25,841 --> 00:56:27,343
[laughs nervously]

1171
00:56:28,760 --> 00:56:30,808
You gotta lower your arms.

1172
00:56:38,437 --> 00:56:40,155
I don't know. I--

1173
00:56:40,314 --> 00:56:42,988
<i>Average, I guess.</i>

1174
00:56:45,068 --> 00:56:47,662
All right, I need you
to do me a favor.

1175
00:56:47,821 --> 00:56:49,823
We need to find out
if she's hiding any money up there,

1176
00:56:49,990 --> 00:56:53,995
so I want you to tell her
to turn around and bend over.

1177
00:56:55,037 --> 00:56:56,163
Why?

1178
00:56:56,330 --> 00:56:58,003
<i>That's just a standard cavity search.</i>

1179
00:56:58,165 --> 00:57:00,008
<i>You've probably seen that on TV,</i>

1180
00:57:00,167 --> 00:57:01,919
<i>at the airport even sometimes, just to...</i>

1181
00:57:02,085 --> 00:57:03,052
All right.

1182
00:57:03,211 --> 00:57:05,805
<i>See if she's holding anything</i>
<i>in any of her, uh, orifices.</i>

1183
00:57:05,964 --> 00:57:07,090
All right. All right.

1184
00:57:09,551 --> 00:57:12,600
He says you have to turn around
and you have to bend over

1185
00:57:13,639 --> 00:57:16,358
so I can see if there's
anything up in there.

1186
00:57:18,226 --> 00:57:19,398
Turn around.

1187
00:57:19,561 --> 00:57:23,191
<i>You know, it might help if you just--</i>
<i>you make her call you sir</i>

1188
00:57:23,357 --> 00:57:24,609
<i>and tell her to hold her ankles.</i>

1189
00:57:25,734 --> 00:57:26,701
Why?

1190
00:57:26,860 --> 00:57:28,487
<i>Well, she's gonna respect the authority.</i>

1191
00:57:28,654 --> 00:57:31,908
<i>If not, she's just gonna run</i>
<i>ramshod all over you.</i>

1192
00:57:33,408 --> 00:57:35,581
He says you have to call me sir

1193
00:57:36,286 --> 00:57:40,041
so that when I ask you to do something,
I know you're gonna do it.

1194
00:57:40,207 --> 00:57:42,209
All right?

1195
00:57:42,376 --> 00:57:43,628
[faintly] Yes, sir.

1196
00:57:46,880 --> 00:57:48,382
<i>What's, uh--</i>

1197
00:57:48,548 --> 00:57:51,097
<i>What's that look like?</i>
<i>Is she shaved?</i>

1198
00:57:51,259 --> 00:57:53,637
I don't know. I guess, uh, she's--

1199
00:57:53,804 --> 00:57:57,229
It's trimmed, I guess.

1200
00:57:57,391 --> 00:58:00,315
It's shaved. I just--
it's just been a couple days.

1201
00:58:00,477 --> 00:58:01,979
She said it's actually shaved.

1202
00:58:02,145 --> 00:58:04,648
Who said? She said that?

1203
00:58:04,815 --> 00:58:05,782
<i>Yeah.</i>

1204
00:58:05,941 --> 00:58:06,783
<i>[chuckles]</i>

1205
00:58:06,942 --> 00:58:07,909
Nice work, Evan.

1206
00:58:08,068 --> 00:58:10,070
We need to deputize you, huh?

1207
00:58:13,907 --> 00:58:16,535
Can I give her the--the apron back now?

1208
00:58:16,702 --> 00:58:17,874
<i>No.</i>

1209
00:58:20,455 --> 00:58:22,583
Boy, it really must be stuck up there.

1210
00:58:22,749 --> 00:58:27,300
Okay, um, we have a special
procedure that we do in this case.

1211
00:58:27,462 --> 00:58:30,591
Uh, have her turn around.

1212
00:58:30,757 --> 00:58:32,225
<i>She is around.</i>

1213
00:58:32,384 --> 00:58:34,261
<i>Okay'</i>

1214
00:58:35,387 --> 00:58:37,435
Yeah, I'm gonna need you to have her
do jumping jacks...

1215
00:58:38,765 --> 00:58:40,233
to try and shake it out.

1216
00:58:41,560 --> 00:58:43,062
Huh?

1217
00:58:43,603 --> 00:58:45,981
Have her jog in place or do jumping jacks

1218
00:58:46,148 --> 00:58:49,027
to see if we can get the money dislodged.

1219
00:58:53,363 --> 00:58:54,831
I don't know.

1220
00:58:54,990 --> 00:58:57,960
<i>What were you doing tonight?</i>
<i>Have a few beers?</i>

1221
00:58:58,118 --> 00:58:59,870

Yeah, that's an excellent idea.

This is my bunny, Lovey.

1532
01:18:52,770 --> 01:18:54,443
I got it at my grandpa's house.

1533
01:18:54,605 --> 01:18:56,528
Oh, yeah?
You got it at grandpa's house?

1534
01:18:56,690 --> 01:18:59,364
Um, and do you know
how many pockets he has?

1535
01:18:59,526 --> 01:19:00,493
How many?

1536
01:19:00,653 --> 01:19:02,530
He--He has one pocket right here.

1537
01:19:02,696 --> 01:19:04,448
- Just one?
- Did you know Lovey

1538
01:19:04,615 --> 01:19:06,492
got married to a mermaid named Lydia?

1539
01:19:06,659 --> 01:19:07,785
DANIELS: Oh, wow.

made everyone lose their fucking minds?

find the caller.

1542
01:19:13,415 --> 01:19:14,758
- Okay.
- All right. And...

1543
01:19:14,917 --> 01:19:17,761
my best guess is the grocery

1544
01:19:17,920 --> 01:19:19,422
or the Boston Market
across the street.

1545
01:19:20,589 --> 01:19:23,342
Ask around. See if they saw anybody
suspicious lingering on the phone

1546
01:19:23,509 --> 01:19:25,307
out in front of their stores for too long.

1547
01:19:25,469 --> 01:19:28,018
Guy wasn't calling
from a local number or cell.

1548
01:19:28,180 --> 01:19:30,057
He was calling from a calling card.

1549
01:19:30,641 --> 01:19:31,608
DETECTIVE: Uh, yes, hello.

1550
01:19:31,767 --> 01:19:34,862
Uh, I'm calling because
we had a situation here

1551
01:19:35,020 --> 01:19:39,116
where a prank phone call
led to a sexual assault,

1552
01:19:39,275 --> 01:19:41,653
um, actually a rape, but, uh,

1553
01:19:41,819 --> 01:19:45,369
we found that the calling card,
uh, used to make the call

1554
01:19:45,531 --> 01:19:47,909
was purchased in your jurisdiction.

1555
01:19:48,075 --> 01:19:49,622
Prank phone call
that turned into a rape.

1556
01:19:49,785 --> 01:19:52,755
Yeah, I remember.
It was at a fast-food joint, right?

1563

You're calling from Boston, right?

1564
01:20:09,680 --> 01:20:10,522
<i>Boston? No.</i>

1565

- Yeah, right there.

1572
01:20:50,929 --> 01:20:51,771
So he paid cash.

1573

We're calling today

with an important offer
about your banking security.

Well, you should know
that our company

BECKY: I wanted to speak with you
about a civil suit against Sandra Fromme.

1593
01:21:45,984 --> 01:21:48,453
WOMAN:
I don't think that's the route to take.

1594
01:21:48,612 --> 01:21:51,081
These calls were happening
all over the country,

even in your particular chain.

Oh, no. I'm--Thank you.

1597
01:21:54,159 --> 01:21:55,786

former fast-food worker,

TV INTERVIEWER: So you and Van

No, I haven't talked to him

But do you feel any responsibility
for what you did?

but I...

1612

was the right thing.

they were the police.

1618
01:22:55,137 --> 01:22:59,313
Did you know that the police station
was only a half-mile away?

1619
01:22:59,475 --> 01:23:04,447
Well, what he said was
that he was investigating from her house.

1620
01:23:04,605 --> 01:23:06,858
And I asked him...
[exhales sharply]

1621
01:23:07,024 --> 01:23:09,322
You know, "When are you coming?"
I asked many times.

1622
01:23:09,485 --> 01:23:13,786
And yet he never came,
and that didn't make you suspicious?

1623
01:23:13,947 --> 01:23:16,075
Um, yeah, well...

1624
01:23:16,533 --> 01:23:20,538
He had an answer every time
that I asked a question.

1625
01:23:20,704 --> 01:23:23,799
And everything about it
was strange to me,

1626
01:23:23,957 --> 01:23:27,052
but he--I was very, very stressed,

1627
01:23:27,211 --> 01:23:29,305
and we were very busy,

1628
01:23:29,463 --> 01:23:34,811
and when I asked him a question,
he always had an answer.

1629
01:23:34,968 --> 01:23:37,437
Were you brainwashed?

1630
01:23:38,430 --> 01:23:40,558
Brainwashed? Well, I mean,

1631
01:23:41,266 --> 01:23:42,518
I felt very foolish.

1632
01:23:42,851 --> 01:23:44,194
I can say that. Heh.

1633
01:23:44,978 --> 01:23:46,855
But I don't know would I say brainwashed.

1634
01:23:47,022 --> 01:23:48,774
Maybe, a little bit.

1635
01:23:48,941 --> 01:23:50,443
So you were a victim, too.

1636
01:23:50,609 --> 01:23:52,486
I was absolutely a victim.

1637
01:23:52,653 --> 01:23:54,826
Not maybe like Becky was a victim,

1638
01:23:54,988 --> 01:23:59,915
but, uh, that was a very evil prank
that was played,

1639
01:24:00,077 --> 01:24:02,580
and I didn't want to do those things.

1640
01:24:02,746 --> 01:24:04,919
I felt he took advantage of me.

1641
01:24:05,082 --> 01:24:07,210
I did what I was told to do.

1642
01:24:08,043 --> 01:24:10,387
Becky told you
that she didn't want you to do it.

1643
01:24:10,546 --> 01:24:13,720
It wasn't a prank to her.
She begged you to stop.

1644
01:24:14,967 --> 01:24:17,390
It never occurred to you to think twice?

1645

Well, she didn't--

1646
01:24:18,971 --> 01:24:20,097
No, I don't--

1647

that she--Yeah.

1651
01:24:31,149 --> 01:24:35,029
Well, it seems like she's crying
and begging on the tape.

1652
01:24:35,195 --> 01:24:39,496
What about when you came in
and Van still had her uncovered?

1653
01:24:40,284 --> 01:24:41,376
No, she had her apron.

1654

She always had the apron on.

1655

She was covered by the apron.

I'm sorry. I don't understand.

- one moment when you walk in.
