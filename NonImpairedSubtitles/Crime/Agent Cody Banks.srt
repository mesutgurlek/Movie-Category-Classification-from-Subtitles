1
00:01:09,169 --> 00:01:10,636
Morning.

2
00:01:10,670 --> 00:01:14,265
Dad, we have to discuss my allowance -
I need a raise.

3
00:01:14,307 --> 00:01:17,299
Alex, buying your girlfriend more
gummi bears won't close the deal.

4
00:01:17,343 --> 00:01:19,334
Like you'd know.

5
00:01:19,379 --> 00:01:23,611
But Mom, Cody's almost 16
and I've had twice as many dates as him.

6
00:01:23,650 --> 00:01:26,642
Sitting in a tree house
isn't exactly a date.

7
00:01:26,686 --> 00:01:29,519
- It is when you're playing doctor.
- Bye!

8
00:01:35,462 --> 00:01:37,987
You smell good. Did you shave?

9
00:01:40,133 --> 00:01:42,727
- Don't forget your chores.
- I'll do them later.

10
00:01:42,769 --> 00:01:46,261
Cody, those guinea pigs have been
sitting in excrement for days.

11
00:01:46,306 --> 00:01:50,037
Alex, you play with them more than I do -
how about we trade chores?

12
00:01:50,076 --> 00:01:51,668
I'll mow the lawn three times.

13
00:01:51,711 --> 00:01:56,410
No way. Just cos I'm ten doesn't mean
I don't know what excrement means.

14
00:01:57,517 --> 00:01:59,382
We're eating here.

15
00:02:12,132 --> 00:02:14,600
Sweetie, Mommy will be right back.

16
00:02:58,878 --> 00:03:01,574
My baby! My baby's in that car!

17
00:03:01,614 --> 00:03:03,707
Somebody stop that car!

18
00:03:48,962 --> 00:03:51,021
Unlock the door!

19
00:03:57,604 --> 00:03:59,765
Hey, kid! Get out the way!

20
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:56,258
Next time, please stick with a tricycle.

21
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:15,771
Sweetie, it's OK.

22
00:05:19,352 --> 00:05:22,014
- What happened?
- Some kid stopped it.

23
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:43,238
Dr. Connors, we've given you
a great deal of money.

24
00:05:44,310 --> 00:05:46,244
We expect results.

25
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:52,349
If you gentlemen would step this way,
please? Gather round.

26
00:05:54,787 --> 00:05:59,383
Imagine we're somewhere in Alaska
and an oil tanker runs aground.

27
00:05:59,425 --> 00:06:01,985
What do we get?

28
00:06:02,028 --> 00:06:04,656
An oil spill, one of the most serious
threats to nature.

29
00:06:04,697 --> 00:06:08,463
A calamity that could take generations
for sea life to recover.

30
00:06:08,501 --> 00:06:11,163
But wait-what's this?

31
00:06:11,204 --> 00:06:12,933
Look who's coming.

32
00:06:12,972 --> 00:06:15,202
The nanobots.

33
00:06:28,221 --> 00:06:30,212
Lovely.

34
00:06:33,159 --> 00:06:36,890
Baby seals everywhere
will praise your name, Doctor.

35
00:06:39,766 --> 00:06:42,030
So, is that real oil, Connors?

36
00:06:42,068 --> 00:06:44,468
Oh, yeah.

37
00:06:44,504 --> 00:06:47,496
Here's a sample.
You can test it if you want.

38
00:06:50,343 --> 00:06:53,141
Can they be programmed
to eat anything other than oil?

39
00:06:53,179 --> 00:06:58,310
Theoretically they could break down
any silicon- Or carbon-based compound.

40
00:06:58,351 --> 00:07:00,012
- You have ten days.
- What?

41
00:07:01,954 --> 00:07:04,684
- That's impossible.
- He said you have ten days.

42
00:07:05,591 --> 00:07:07,957
We have our own agenda, Doctor.

43
00:07:08,995 --> 00:07:12,556
- That's impossible.
- Goodbye, Dr. Connors.

44
00:07:12,598 --> 00:07:14,828
He still has no idea
what we hope to achieve.

45
00:07:14,867 --> 00:07:16,698
Let's keep it that way, François.

46
00:07:29,048 --> 00:07:32,176
- I told you no ice. Here.
- I'm sorry, sir.

47
00:07:32,218 --> 00:07:34,778
You never know how long
it's been in the freezer,

48
00:07:34,821 --> 00:07:37,619
could be filled with all kind of crap.

49
00:07:39,525 --> 00:07:41,516
This is Dr. Albert Connors.

50
00:07:43,296 --> 00:07:47,892
The world's foremost expert in
nanotechnology-microscopic robots.

51
00:07:49,802 --> 00:07:51,793
These robots could be programmed

52
00:07:51,838 --> 00:07:55,797
to destroy our most vital communication
and military infrastructure.

53
00:07:55,842 --> 00:07:59,209
I'm talking missile guidance systems,
boats, tanks,

54
00:07:59,245 --> 00:08:01,236
planes, biological and...

55
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:03,646
We get the point. Before we lost contact,

56
00:08:03,683 --> 00:08:07,710
Agent Bolivar confirmed that Connors
is working with E.R.I.S.

57
00:08:07,753 --> 00:08:11,655
This is probably my last transmission.
I think they're onto me.

58
00:08:12,158 --> 00:08:15,719
Don't send any more agents -
everyone has been compromised.

59
00:08:15,761 --> 00:08:18,093
I'd better transmit images now.

60
00:08:18,130 --> 00:08:21,930
This is yesterday
at the E.R.I.S. covert conference

61
00:08:21,968 --> 00:08:24,994
where Dr. Connors demonstrated
his latest advancements.

62
00:08:25,037 --> 00:08:28,438
And this is Dr. Brinkman, head of E.R.I.S.

63
00:08:28,975 --> 00:08:32,934
And this, François Molay, his henchman.

64
00:08:33,546 --> 00:08:36,174
As far as I understand it, they plan...

65
00:08:43,122 --> 00:08:45,352
We need to know what they're planning.

66
00:08:45,391 --> 00:08:48,827
The problem is,
Connors is very reclusive.

67
00:08:49,729 --> 00:08:53,495
After his wife died two years ago, Connors
dropped out of public view.

68
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:58,197
His only contact with the outside world is
through his daughter Natalie.

69
00:08:59,872 --> 00:09:02,363
I wanna get close to this girl.

70
00:09:03,910 --> 00:09:05,468
McAllister,

71
00:09:05,511 --> 00:09:08,378
brief the staff
on the Agent Development Program.

72
00:09:09,515 --> 00:09:14,543
Under the guise of an elite summer camp,
we began to recruit.

73
00:09:16,222 --> 00:09:18,622
Welcome to
the Agent Development Program.

74
00:09:18,658 --> 00:09:21,058
Since 1987, and under strict secrecy,

75
00:09:21,093 --> 00:09:24,028
the CIA has recruited juvenile agents
the nation over.

76
00:09:24,063 --> 00:09:27,521
As soon as we received word that
a potential candidate had been spotted,

77
00:09:27,567 --> 00:09:32,834
we brought them into our facilities
under the guise of summer camps.

78
00:09:32,872 --> 00:09:36,171
Their parents had no idea
of their real activities.

79
00:09:36,208 --> 00:09:39,200
They were expertly trained
in combat, defense,

80
00:09:39,245 --> 00:09:42,646
navigation and, of course,
explosives defusion.

81
00:09:42,682 --> 00:09:46,209
Our juvenile agents
are stationed all over the nation.

82
00:09:46,252 --> 00:09:49,813
They meticulously maintain
the facades of normal childhoods

83
00:09:49,855 --> 00:09:52,050
as they await their call for duty.

84
00:09:52,091 --> 00:09:54,116
Wait, wait, wait.

85
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:57,926
You're telling me we're training
children to become agents?

86
00:09:57,964 --> 00:10:01,730
Teenagers.
Look, let's be clear about this -

87
00:10:01,767 --> 00:10:04,429
this may be our last best chance.

88
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:06,461
These kids operate alone?

89
00:10:06,505 --> 00:10:09,941
No, that would be irresponsible.

90
00:10:09,976 --> 00:10:14,310
One of our most impressive agents. Lives
not far from Natalie Connors.

91
00:10:14,347 --> 00:10:16,713
Smart, resourceful,

92
00:10:17,717 --> 00:10:20,049
and, according to my reports,

93
00:10:21,854 --> 00:10:23,845
he's quite a lady-killer.

94
00:10:26,926 --> 00:10:28,917
Do you...?

95
00:10:28,961 --> 00:10:31,156
Hi, Cody.

96
00:10:38,170 --> 00:10:40,138
Are you in special ed?

97
00:10:48,714 --> 00:10:50,705
Hi, Cody!

98
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:53,116
Do you think, Amy, that...

99
00:10:53,152 --> 00:10:54,983
Friday night we...

100
00:10:55,021 --> 00:10:57,683
Cody, I need to study,

101
00:10:57,723 --> 00:11:01,056
so why don't you go jump off a cliff
or something?

102
00:11:24,650 --> 00:11:26,880
Cody Banks.

103
00:11:28,621 --> 00:11:30,714
You want him?

104
00:11:30,756 --> 00:11:32,519
She wants Cody.

105
00:11:32,558 --> 00:11:36,119
Quiet! Or you'll all be in trouble.

106
00:11:38,931 --> 00:11:41,798
- You, come with me.
- Why?

107
00:11:41,834 --> 00:11:43,995
Hey, I wanna be in trouble.

108
00:11:51,410 --> 00:11:55,210
Since you're on the business
of taking towels, take mine too.

109
00:11:55,915 --> 00:11:58,406
Could you hold this, please? Thank you.

110
00:11:58,451 --> 00:12:00,385
I really hate it...

111
00:12:01,087 --> 00:12:03,055
when people talk back.

112
00:12:08,427 --> 00:12:09,894
Thank you. Let's go.

113
00:12:09,929 --> 00:12:11,920
Who are you? What did I do?

114
00:12:16,769 --> 00:12:20,637
Mary had a little lamb,
its fleece as white as snow.

115
00:12:24,210 --> 00:12:27,179
Peter Piper picked a peck
of pickled peppers.

116
00:12:27,213 --> 00:12:29,443
Bubblegum, bubblegum in a dish.

117
00:12:29,482 --> 00:12:31,347
How many pieces do you wish?

118
00:12:31,383 --> 00:12:36,150
This is what happens when you design
a code book at summer camp!

119
00:12:40,292 --> 00:12:43,352
So I'm being called up?
My country needs me?

120
00:12:43,395 --> 00:12:45,386
- Yep.
- Where are we going?

121
00:12:45,431 --> 00:12:48,832
The Middle East? Russia? China?

122
00:12:48,868 --> 00:12:50,859
Downtown Seattle.

123
00:13:08,654 --> 00:13:11,282
I'm in! My first mission!

124
00:13:11,323 --> 00:13:13,791
Didn't think it would happen this soon?

125
00:13:13,826 --> 00:13:16,556
Plus, I didn't think my partner was...

126
00:13:16,595 --> 00:13:20,395
Let's get one thing straight,
I am not your partner.

127
00:13:20,432 --> 00:13:22,593
I'm your handler.

128
00:13:22,635 --> 00:13:24,626
Like in the zoo.

129
00:13:28,841 --> 00:13:30,832
You will speak only when spoken to,

130
00:13:30,876 --> 00:13:33,572
you will follow orders without question.

131
00:13:33,612 --> 00:13:35,603
If you're lucky, you might...

132
00:13:41,187 --> 00:13:44,088
How did you get in here?
There's no school tour today.

133
00:13:44,123 --> 00:13:47,320
I'm not on a school tour. I'm an agent.

134
00:13:47,359 --> 00:13:51,352
I just came from basketball practice,
I left my ID in my other clothes.

135
00:13:51,397 --> 00:13:54,059
- I'm with Ronica Miles.
- You wish!

136
00:13:55,668 --> 00:13:57,659
Here he is.

137
00:14:00,506 --> 00:14:03,998
Sir, I've apprehended a trespasser.
It was a bit of a struggle.

138
00:14:04,043 --> 00:14:06,238
- What's your name?
- Rosychuk.

139
00:14:06,278 --> 00:14:08,269
Come here, Rosychuk.

140
00:14:08,914 --> 00:14:11,109
You know, you've just apprehended

141
00:14:11,150 --> 00:14:13,482
the most important kid in America!

142
00:14:16,155 --> 00:14:18,988
Mr. Banks, this way, this way.

143
00:14:19,024 --> 00:14:21,015
What was he thinking?

144
00:14:21,594 --> 00:14:23,858
You got agent written all over you.

145
00:14:25,764 --> 00:14:28,130
It's in the eyes.

146
00:14:28,167 --> 00:14:30,499
You got it, kid. Come on.

147
00:14:31,704 --> 00:14:33,695
Welcome to the CIA.

148
00:14:34,573 --> 00:14:38,304
So you like the Sonics? What about
front-row seats for the play-offs?

149
00:14:41,780 --> 00:14:45,113
We've prepared a briefing
to explain nanobots to you.

150
00:14:45,150 --> 00:14:48,176
Yeah, I know them.
Tiny weapons, giant potential.

151
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:52,520
Micro-devices built up of compounds
of polymer cobalt and gold,

152
00:14:52,558 --> 00:14:56,722
or constructed with multiple fullerene
complexes called buckysomes,

153
00:14:56,762 --> 00:14:59,822
universal assemblers
that can bond circuits,

154
00:14:59,865 --> 00:15:01,856
with the most impressive tests

155
00:15:01,901 --> 00:15:05,337
having been conducted
at Sweden's Lintzerpein University.

156
00:15:09,642 --> 00:15:12,338
I guess we can move on.

157
00:15:12,378 --> 00:15:15,006
Let's turn to Natalie Connors.

158
00:15:15,047 --> 00:15:18,949
Natalie Connors, 15 years old.
Hair blonde, eyes brown.

159
00:15:18,984 --> 00:15:21,452
Likes horses-preferably Arabians -

160
00:15:21,487 --> 00:15:24,718
pistachio ice cream, turquoise jewelry,

161
00:15:24,757 --> 00:15:26,748
and TS Eliot.

162
00:15:26,792 --> 00:15:30,785
Learn everything you can about
this girl. I want you to get close to her.

163
00:15:30,829 --> 00:15:34,128
That's my mission?
I have to get close to her?

164
00:15:34,166 --> 00:15:37,192
Yes. Insinuate yourself into her life.

165
00:15:37,236 --> 00:15:41,935
It is imperative you find out what
her father and E.R.I.S. are planning.

166
00:15:41,974 --> 00:15:45,535
We'll help.
We've placed you in all of her classes.

167
00:15:45,577 --> 00:15:48,774
All of them? Isn't that a little creepy?

168
00:15:48,814 --> 00:15:50,611
Creepy?

169
00:15:50,649 --> 00:15:54,710
We're the CIA, that's what we do. Right?

170
00:15:58,824 --> 00:16:01,418
You want me to become her boyfriend?

171
00:16:03,495 --> 00:16:08,296
It's simple. Natalie has a birthday soon.
Her father's throwing a party.

172
00:16:08,334 --> 00:16:10,996
The first step is to get invited
to that party.

173
00:16:11,637 --> 00:16:16,404
And be careful. This is not secret agent
little league any more.

174
00:16:16,442 --> 00:16:19,809
This is the show, Mr. Banks,
and this is showtime.

175
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:23,972
If you can't handle it,
you just tell me now.

176
00:16:27,419 --> 00:16:29,410
You can count on me.

177
00:16:37,629 --> 00:16:39,961
Attention. Rocket launch test.

178
00:16:45,971 --> 00:16:48,940
I know it's tempting
but don't touch anything.

179
00:16:49,608 --> 00:16:51,803
Four, three,

180
00:16:51,844 --> 00:16:53,835
two, one.

181
00:17:01,854 --> 00:17:04,118
Mr. Banks, come see me, son.

182
00:17:06,859 --> 00:17:09,157
I've prepared a number of dope items

183
00:17:09,194 --> 00:17:12,163
which I think you're gonna be down with.

184
00:17:12,197 --> 00:17:15,655
This item here is equipped
with a virtual telephoto lens,

185
00:17:15,701 --> 00:17:18,499
low-penetration X-ray.

186
00:17:20,739 --> 00:17:22,730
Give me that!

187
00:17:23,342 --> 00:17:25,333
This is your cell phone.

188
00:17:25,377 --> 00:17:28,312
It's a state-of-the-art
mobile command center

189
00:17:28,347 --> 00:17:30,838
with a holographic audiovisual display

190
00:17:30,883 --> 00:17:33,147
and a personal GPS transceiver.

191
00:17:35,888 --> 00:17:40,450
Now, this is a CIA
get-out-of-trouble watch.

192
00:17:40,492 --> 00:17:42,483
See this silver button?

193
00:17:42,528 --> 00:17:45,793
Be very careful
with this little silver button

194
00:17:45,831 --> 00:17:47,992
cos it'll make people go...

195
00:17:48,934 --> 00:17:51,061
Wait, what was that?

196
00:17:51,103 --> 00:17:52,832
Wait, one more time.

197
00:17:55,741 --> 00:17:57,732
I don't even wanna know.

198
00:18:02,014 --> 00:18:04,005
All right, let's wrap this up.

199
00:18:04,983 --> 00:18:07,349
Five thousand dollars cash.

200
00:18:07,386 --> 00:18:10,116
What for?

201
00:18:10,155 --> 00:18:14,057
I think they buy things with it.
I don't know. I believe.

202
00:18:14,093 --> 00:18:15,754
OK, that's it.

203
00:18:15,794 --> 00:18:17,785
Thanks for coming.

204
00:18:17,830 --> 00:18:20,890
Wait. I think we're forgetting something.

205
00:18:20,933 --> 00:18:23,561
- I'm not.
- What about those wheels?

206
00:18:23,602 --> 00:18:28,232
No, Cody, that's on a need-to-drive
basis. You don't need to drive.

207
00:18:28,273 --> 00:18:30,741
I need to impress the girls.

208
00:18:30,776 --> 00:18:33,904
So we got you fixed up. Look at this.

209
00:18:35,414 --> 00:18:37,974
This thing is really full of surprises.

210
00:18:38,016 --> 00:18:40,883
- Fine.
- I think you're gonna impress the girls.

211
00:18:43,088 --> 00:18:45,613
- Good luck.
- Thanks.

212
00:18:46,658 --> 00:18:49,320
You're transferring to a prep school?

213
00:18:49,361 --> 00:18:52,990
Yeah, I got a full scholarship
to Donovan Prep Academy.

214
00:18:53,031 --> 00:18:55,056
A scholarship? Hold on.

215
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:58,536
I don't understand. When did you apply?
Did I sign something?

216
00:18:58,570 --> 00:19:02,062
Yeah, a few months ago.
It's always been my dream to go there.

217
00:19:02,107 --> 00:19:05,167
It has? But what about your friends?

218
00:19:05,210 --> 00:19:08,304
- I'll make new ones.
- With all those spoiled brats?

219
00:19:08,347 --> 00:19:11,316
And why would they want you?

220
00:19:11,350 --> 00:19:16,151
Diversity. At least five per cent
of the students have to be normal.

221
00:19:16,188 --> 00:19:18,179
I don't know about this.

222
00:19:18,223 --> 00:19:20,623
I wanna make something very clear,

223
00:19:20,659 --> 00:19:26,120
I am not agreeing to anything until I meet
an administrator from that school.

224
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:30,759
Mr. Banks.

225
00:19:31,803 --> 00:19:35,102
Ronica Miles from the William Donovan
Preparatory Academy.

226
00:19:35,140 --> 00:19:37,131
I'm an administrator from the school.

227
00:19:40,078 --> 00:19:42,342
Agent Banks.

228
00:19:45,050 --> 00:19:47,644
I heard you really closed the deal
with Amy.

229
00:19:47,686 --> 00:19:50,621
- You should try gummi bears.
- How do you know about that?

230
00:19:50,656 --> 00:19:54,183
- Everybody knows.
- She thinks I'm a loser.

231
00:19:55,294 --> 00:19:57,785
Amy, I...

232
00:19:57,829 --> 00:19:59,990
I'm in high school.

233
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:06,733
Cody is a wonderful student with
extraordinary math and science abilities.

234
00:20:06,772 --> 00:20:10,333
- What is it exactly that you do?
- Dean of admissions.

235
00:20:10,375 --> 00:20:14,937
Donovan Academy feels he isn't being
challenged in his current environment.

236
00:20:14,980 --> 00:20:17,471
Do you have some kind of paperwork?

237
00:20:17,516 --> 00:20:19,507
Of course.

238
00:20:29,828 --> 00:20:31,887
You guys ready for the test?

239
00:20:36,602 --> 00:20:38,866
- Nervous?
- No.

240
00:20:38,904 --> 00:20:40,633
Got your schedule?

241
00:20:42,674 --> 00:20:45,438
"Honors English, trig, chemistry"?

242
00:20:46,812 --> 00:20:50,179
I don't need all of this.
I could just meet her between classes.

243
00:20:50,215 --> 00:20:53,207
You will attend every class as instructed.

244
00:20:53,252 --> 00:20:55,618
You might even learn something.

245
00:20:55,654 --> 00:20:58,452
This isn't what I had in mind
when I signed on to the CIA.

246
00:20:58,490 --> 00:21:01,823
Well, I didn't think
I'd be chaperoning teenagers.

247
00:21:01,860 --> 00:21:04,590
You know, maybe you should try decaf.

248
00:21:09,968 --> 00:21:12,198
It's my job to make sure you do your job.

249
00:21:12,237 --> 00:21:14,398
If you screw up, I take the heat.

250
00:21:16,675 --> 00:21:20,133
So I guess she grows on you. Right?

251
00:21:21,446 --> 00:21:23,277
No.

252
00:21:23,315 --> 00:21:26,284
Admission papers, hat.

253
00:21:26,318 --> 00:21:28,183
Hat? What hat?

254
00:21:28,220 --> 00:21:31,314
Seattle Seahawks,
they're her favorite football team.

255
00:21:31,356 --> 00:21:33,347
You know, it's an icebreaker.

256
00:21:33,392 --> 00:21:35,883
A conversation starter.

257
00:21:37,896 --> 00:21:40,865
Look! That guy has a bird on his head.

258
00:21:43,268 --> 00:21:45,429
- Guys!
- No, it looks good.

259
00:21:46,104 --> 00:21:49,073
I'm not wearing this, I look like an idiot.

260
00:21:49,107 --> 00:21:53,441
There's two minutes till first period,
you don't wanna be tardy.

261
00:21:57,849 --> 00:21:59,612
What if she doesn't like me?

262
00:21:59,651 --> 00:22:02,245
What's not to like?

263
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:43,851
Sorry.

264
00:22:58,877 --> 00:23:00,868
Target acquired.

265
00:23:04,983 --> 00:23:06,507
New kid.

266
00:23:06,551 --> 00:23:09,384
You're the scholarship case
from the other side of town, right?

267
00:23:09,421 --> 00:23:12,584
Pleased to meet you.
My name's Cody. Banks.

268
00:23:12,624 --> 00:23:15,957
Banks? We got something
in common, Cody.

269
00:23:15,994 --> 00:23:17,985
My dad owns banks.

270
00:23:18,029 --> 00:23:20,998
- Very funny. I gotta go.
- Not so fast.

271
00:23:22,434 --> 00:23:24,595
Check it out.

272
00:23:25,537 --> 00:23:28,506
- Come on, give it back.
- What are you gonna do about it?

273
00:23:44,022 --> 00:23:46,456
If you're gonna keep my watch,

274
00:23:46,491 --> 00:23:49,153
promise me you won't touch
that silver button.

275
00:23:49,194 --> 00:23:51,719
- That silver button?
- Yeah, don't touch it.

276
00:24:01,039 --> 00:24:03,200
I told you not to touch it.

277
00:24:17,589 --> 00:24:19,580
Are those books?

278
00:24:21,293 --> 00:24:25,559
I love books. I gotta read all day.
Love 'em.

279
00:24:25,597 --> 00:24:28,259
Great. Then you're in the right place.

280
00:24:30,435 --> 00:24:32,767
I especially love TS Eliot.

281
00:24:34,039 --> 00:24:37,133
- You do?
- I think she's amazing.

282
00:24:37,175 --> 00:24:41,509
The way she captures the female
perspective is just so female-like.

283
00:24:41,546 --> 00:24:43,537
It's great.

284
00:24:44,015 --> 00:24:46,745
TS Eliot is a man.

285
00:24:46,785 --> 00:24:50,949
If you wanna get technical, of course,
but you never know these days.

286
00:24:50,989 --> 00:24:54,686
Do you by any chance happen to be
in special ed?

287
00:24:54,726 --> 00:24:56,557
I love horses.

288
00:24:56,595 --> 00:24:58,256
I think...

289
00:24:58,296 --> 00:25:00,696
their hair thing is really cool.

290
00:25:01,433 --> 00:25:03,424
What a freak.

291
00:25:07,639 --> 00:25:12,474
...two and divide by x minus two
and we'll end up with...

292
00:25:12,511 --> 00:25:16,470
Natalie Connors. Way out of your league.

293
00:25:16,515 --> 00:25:18,915
...point 4968. Any questions?

294
00:25:21,820 --> 00:25:24,015
Driver's Ed.

295
00:25:25,023 --> 00:25:29,357
- Oh, my God. Are you gonna go?
- Yeah, it's gonna be great.

296
00:25:31,963 --> 00:25:34,898
- Uh-oh, here comes horse guy.
- Good luck.

297
00:25:37,536 --> 00:25:40,061
Hey. You got Driver's Ed too?

298
00:25:41,106 --> 00:25:44,075
What's the deal?
You're in every one of my classes.

299
00:25:44,109 --> 00:25:46,168
I guess great minds think alike.

300
00:25:49,881 --> 00:25:53,339
Great, we've got Mr. Yip.
He doesn't pass anybody.

301
00:25:53,385 --> 00:25:56,843
Look, if you don't pass,
I'm sure your dad can drive you around.

302
00:25:56,888 --> 00:26:00,051
It's because of my dad
that I need a license.

303
00:26:00,091 --> 00:26:03,322
- So you can drive him around?
- No, so I can drive me around.

304
00:26:03,361 --> 00:26:05,955
- Why, is he busy with something?
- Yeah.

305
00:26:05,997 --> 00:26:08,158
He's always doing
some kind of experiment.

306
00:26:08,199 --> 00:26:11,657
- Like a scientific experiment?
- Yeah, he's a scientist.

307
00:26:11,703 --> 00:26:15,764
- Cool! With microscopes?
- You're getting weird again.

308
00:26:18,743 --> 00:26:21,303
Good afternoon, children.

309
00:26:21,980 --> 00:26:25,006
Driving is a privilege, not a right.

310
00:26:26,051 --> 00:26:31,045
I'd be delighted to instruct you
in operation of motor vehicle.

311
00:26:31,089 --> 00:26:37,358
But, I have a larger responsibility
to protect society at large

312
00:26:37,395 --> 00:26:40,853
from the idiots
and the drug-addled delinquents

313
00:26:40,899 --> 00:26:43,868
who call themselves...

314
00:26:43,902 --> 00:26:45,733
the youth of today.

315
00:26:45,770 --> 00:26:47,761
Today!

316
00:26:52,444 --> 00:26:54,878
You name Miss Connors?

317
00:26:55,914 --> 00:26:58,314
Yeah? You first!

318
00:26:58,350 --> 00:27:00,318
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go!

319
00:27:07,726 --> 00:27:09,819
Look left, look right!

320
00:27:09,861 --> 00:27:13,058
You didn't turn on your blinks!
Are you dyslexic?

321
00:27:13,098 --> 00:27:16,192
This is your left, that is your right.

322
00:27:16,635 --> 00:27:19,695
No, no, no, no!
Get out of the driver's seat!

323
00:27:19,738 --> 00:27:21,433
OK, I...

324
00:27:24,743 --> 00:27:28,076
One grandma.
Multiple cones, three curbs.

325
00:27:29,314 --> 00:27:33,273
- Who can drive with you screaming?
- You fail. Fail! Fail!

326
00:27:33,318 --> 00:27:36,617
- No, I need to get my license.
- Next!

327
00:27:38,590 --> 00:27:40,581
Damn, the floor mat isn't straight.

328
00:27:46,498 --> 00:27:48,932
- All ready.
- Good.

329
00:27:54,639 --> 00:27:56,436
What are you doing now?

330
00:28:16,695 --> 00:28:19,163
What are you doing now?

331
00:28:34,379 --> 00:28:37,746
Stop the car! Stop the car right now!

332
00:28:43,621 --> 00:28:45,680
- Did I pass?
- Nat, are you OK?

333
00:28:45,724 --> 00:28:48,522
Oh, my God, he almost rolled over.

334
00:28:49,561 --> 00:28:53,122
- Come on.
- Actually, I don't feel so good.

335
00:28:53,164 --> 00:28:55,359
He totally could have killed you.

336
00:28:56,401 --> 00:28:58,699
Just stay away from her.

337
00:28:58,737 --> 00:29:00,534
Are you OK?

338
00:29:05,043 --> 00:29:09,446
You! I will personally go to DMV.

339
00:29:09,481 --> 00:29:13,679
You will not receive a driver's license!

340
00:29:17,756 --> 00:29:19,314
Never!

341
00:29:24,729 --> 00:29:26,890
- Mr. Yip.
- What?

342
00:29:27,932 --> 00:29:31,527
We'd like to have a word about
Mr. Banks' driver's license.

343
00:29:31,569 --> 00:29:33,127
Immigrations paper OK!

344
00:29:35,974 --> 00:29:37,965
My fellow agents.

345
00:29:43,815 --> 00:29:46,443
- Good luck.
- Good luck.

346
00:29:46,484 --> 00:29:48,475
- He's dead.
- So dead.

347
00:29:49,220 --> 00:29:51,085
Hey, Cody.

348
00:29:51,122 --> 00:29:53,989
- How did it go today?
- Great.

349
00:29:54,025 --> 00:29:56,016
I've got her eating out of my hand.

350
00:29:56,060 --> 00:29:59,393
Fantastic.
So, she invited you to the party?

351
00:29:59,931 --> 00:30:01,922
No, but the vibes are right.

352
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:12,703
- Have you asked her out yet?
- Not yet. But don't rush me.

353
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:18,342
The clock's ticking. What about tonight?

354
00:30:23,888 --> 00:30:26,448
It's a school night. I got homework.

355
00:30:33,298 --> 00:30:36,961
- What's the problem?
- Nothing, but Natalie's a brain.

356
00:30:37,001 --> 00:30:39,561
All those AP classes.
My workload's insane.

357
00:30:41,773 --> 00:30:44,765
- This mission depends on you.
- I know, but...

358
00:30:46,945 --> 00:30:50,403
Come on. Tonight I had to do
two chapters of trigonometry.

359
00:30:50,448 --> 00:30:53,884
Plus an essay on Henry V,
not to mention my chores.

360
00:30:57,121 --> 00:31:01,490
- Of course, if I had a little help...
- I can't believe this.

361
00:31:01,526 --> 00:31:06,589
All right... The agency will take care
of your chores and your homework.

362
00:31:06,631 --> 00:31:08,963
You focus on the girl.

363
00:31:30,989 --> 00:31:33,423
Teams A and B commence
domestic sanitation.

364
00:31:38,630 --> 00:31:42,623
Team three, I need a new sponge. Repeat,
need a new sponge, over.

365
00:31:42,667 --> 00:31:44,658
You missed a spot.

366
00:31:47,739 --> 00:31:50,936
Negative, negative.
Stand by, flannel only...

367
00:31:52,644 --> 00:31:55,511
Which one would you prefer -
this one or this one?

368
00:31:55,546 --> 00:31:57,878
- I like this myself.
- Good choice.

369
00:31:57,916 --> 00:32:00,441
We have dust bunnies
on the second floor.

370
00:32:00,485 --> 00:32:04,683
...to develop a secret weapon.
I'm gonna transmit images now.

371
00:32:05,657 --> 00:32:09,115
This is Dr. Brinkman,
head of E.R.I.S., and this...

372
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:12,061
François Molay, his henchman.

373
00:32:17,869 --> 00:32:20,929
- Get out of the house!
- What? They're here?

374
00:32:20,972 --> 00:32:23,532
They shouldn't be here for another hour.

375
00:32:23,574 --> 00:32:26,134
- I don't know...
- Come on. Move, move.

376
00:32:39,357 --> 00:32:42,656
- Move it, get out of there.
- Get that thing out of there.

377
00:32:42,694 --> 00:32:44,924
Right there, let's go.

378
00:32:47,532 --> 00:32:52,196
Wait! Wait, wait, wait...
You will wait for me!

379
00:33:02,413 --> 00:33:06,543
Wow, what are they teaching
the kid at that new school?

380
00:33:06,584 --> 00:33:08,575
Oh, my God, look at this.

381
00:33:10,455 --> 00:33:12,446
Holy sh...

382
00:33:26,704 --> 00:33:29,400
I know it's your dream
to play for the Sonics

383
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:33,536
but if that falls through,
you'd make somebody a good janitor.

384
00:33:33,578 --> 00:33:36,342
Well, you told me to do my chores.

385
00:33:36,381 --> 00:33:39,316
Honey, we are very impressed.

386
00:33:39,350 --> 00:33:41,011
Here's five bucks.

387
00:33:41,052 --> 00:33:43,452
- Thanks, Mom.
- Yeah.

388
00:33:55,933 --> 00:33:58,527
I'm gonna go take Marvin for a walk.

389
00:34:17,388 --> 00:34:20,949
- Your homework to your satisfaction?
- Yeah.

390
00:34:21,592 --> 00:34:23,617
Your room is nice and tidy?

391
00:34:24,395 --> 00:34:27,728
- Guinea pig cage is clean?
- Yeah.

392
00:34:27,765 --> 00:34:30,632
Well, I think we've done our part.

393
00:34:30,668 --> 00:34:33,136
Now you do yours. Call Natalie.

394
00:34:34,205 --> 00:34:36,605
In here?

395
00:34:36,641 --> 00:34:38,541
Hurry.

396
00:34:38,576 --> 00:34:40,669
I'll do it in my room.

397
00:34:45,917 --> 00:34:47,908
He pooped twice.

398
00:34:59,197 --> 00:35:02,655
- That wasn't me.
- I don't smell anything.

399
00:35:05,369 --> 00:35:07,360
Get out! Everybody out!

400
00:35:08,506 --> 00:35:10,838
Hello, Natalie. Guess who.

401
00:35:14,412 --> 00:35:16,903
Hey, pretty lady. What's goin' on?

402
00:35:20,251 --> 00:35:23,482
Dude. Natalie. How are you doing?

403
00:35:27,325 --> 00:35:28,986
Hi, Natalie, it's Cody.

404
00:35:29,026 --> 00:35:32,359
I was wondering
what you were doing this Saturday.

405
00:35:43,875 --> 00:35:45,206
Hello?

406
00:35:47,912 --> 00:35:50,039
Who is this?

407
00:35:55,219 --> 00:35:57,187
This mission is screwed.

408
00:35:57,255 --> 00:35:59,883
We spent $10million training this kid

409
00:35:59,924 --> 00:36:03,257
and we did not teach him
how to talk to a girl?

410
00:36:03,294 --> 00:36:06,229
Sir, I assure you, we had no idea.

411
00:36:06,264 --> 00:36:09,722
- You're shy?
- Cody's a little delicate.

412
00:36:10,768 --> 00:36:13,737
My mother's ceramic cat
collection is delicate.

413
00:36:13,771 --> 00:36:16,763
- This is national security!
- I'm sorry.

414
00:36:19,110 --> 00:36:23,410
On the training program
you bragged about having lots of girls.

415
00:36:23,447 --> 00:36:27,474
It was camp. I exaggerated.
Everyone does.

416
00:36:28,553 --> 00:36:30,783
...to Quad Seven. Agent Raymond...

417
00:36:30,821 --> 00:36:32,812
OK, so...

418
00:36:38,162 --> 00:36:40,494
What is the truth?

419
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:45,594
When it comes to girls, I suck.

420
00:36:51,742 --> 00:36:55,644
You met my dad. Well, I'm his son.

421
00:36:55,680 --> 00:37:00,344
Ladies and gentlemen,
somebody has got to teach this kid

422
00:37:00,384 --> 00:37:02,375
how to talk to a girl!

423
00:37:03,321 --> 00:37:05,812
I understand you're having a problem,

424
00:37:05,856 --> 00:37:10,054
so I've assembled a team of experts
here to help you along

425
00:37:10,094 --> 00:37:13,257
from the point of contact
to the point of closure.

426
00:37:13,297 --> 00:37:14,958
You got to close.

427
00:37:14,999 --> 00:37:17,194
Any species is predicated upon mating.

428
00:37:17,235 --> 00:37:21,194
Males and females must couple
or the animal will surely die off.

429
00:37:21,239 --> 00:37:24,868
- I'm just trying to get a date.
- This is how the hyena does it...

430
00:37:24,909 --> 00:37:29,107
- See this thing here?
- There's a lot of laughing involved.

431
00:37:29,146 --> 00:37:34,174
It makes you wanna give the good Lord
a standing ovation.

432
00:37:34,218 --> 00:37:38,621
You gotta let her know she looks fresh. Pay
her compliments.

433
00:37:38,656 --> 00:37:41,216
Be smart. Get some dirt on her, eh?

434
00:37:41,259 --> 00:37:45,127
They use both sides of their brain
at once-emotion and intellect.

435
00:37:45,162 --> 00:37:48,495
- Check out previous boyfriends.
- Pick her up, don't be late.

436
00:37:48,532 --> 00:37:52,935
- It's a bad way to start off a first date.
- My grandfather used to say,

437
00:37:52,970 --> 00:37:57,373
"Women are like cow chips, the older they
get the easier they are to pick up."

438
00:37:57,408 --> 00:38:01,902
Let's take a few deep breaths
as we turn to the relationship pyramid...

439
00:38:01,946 --> 00:38:04,915
Forget all that,
you gotta be stern, commanding.

440
00:38:04,949 --> 00:38:09,386
- He's dead now.
- Shower before seeing the girl.

441
00:38:09,420 --> 00:38:13,322
No, no, you wanna be dank, dusky
and musky. She's got to smell you.

442
00:38:13,357 --> 00:38:16,690
My father was married 100 years or so.

443
00:38:16,727 --> 00:38:19,252
You gotta smell like a savage beast!

444
00:38:19,297 --> 00:38:22,494
Pull the ring in the back of his neck
and he goes, "My fault!"

445
00:38:22,533 --> 00:38:25,366
- Like a wild animal, the cheetah...
- Excuse me.

446
00:38:25,403 --> 00:38:30,067
If you find yourself in a difficult position,
hang on, fight it out!

447
00:38:30,107 --> 00:38:33,235
Hole up, get your energy back
for the final push!

448
00:38:33,277 --> 00:38:36,337
Think like a hyena, be a hyena.

449
00:38:36,380 --> 00:38:40,111
In the fog of war, it's the one who wants it
the most who wins.

450
00:38:40,151 --> 00:38:44,884
And I don't think you want it the most.
I think you are a pathetic loser.

451
00:38:44,922 --> 00:38:47,584
I think you're a disgrace.

452
00:38:47,625 --> 00:38:52,619
How are you gonna hold your head up
high when you walk down Main Street?

453
00:38:52,663 --> 00:38:56,394
- Straighten up when I talk to you.
- Thank you, General.

454
00:38:56,434 --> 00:38:59,801
I'm sorry this had to happen.
This one's gonna be good.

455
00:39:10,748 --> 00:39:13,148
Don't say I never did nothing for you.

456
00:39:13,184 --> 00:39:15,311
Look at that.

457
00:39:20,524 --> 00:39:22,219
Hey, Cody.

458
00:39:24,161 --> 00:39:26,459
Come over here.

459
00:39:26,497 --> 00:39:29,091
I'm free tonight, what shall we do?

460
00:39:41,979 --> 00:39:44,413
Kid can't even talk
to a simulated woman.

461
00:39:44,448 --> 00:39:49,147
Maybe I should've started him out
at a more intermediate level.

462
00:39:57,795 --> 00:40:00,593
Wait, no, it's a little uneven.

463
00:40:00,631 --> 00:40:03,225
A little... Up more on the right.

464
00:40:19,250 --> 00:40:21,047
Are you OK?

465
00:40:21,085 --> 00:40:23,383
Where did you come from?

466
00:40:23,421 --> 00:40:25,946
I transferred from Jefferson High.

467
00:40:27,224 --> 00:40:30,352
This will help. It'll make you feel better.

468
00:40:30,394 --> 00:40:32,919
Could you hold this, please?

469
00:40:32,963 --> 00:40:35,796
Nurse Hatchett
to the football field, please.

470
00:40:35,833 --> 00:40:37,994
I'll be right back, OK?

471
00:40:40,438 --> 00:40:42,599
You think it's broken?

472
00:40:46,844 --> 00:40:50,473
- Definitely not.
- So, you're a doctor now?

473
00:40:50,514 --> 00:40:54,848
Just experienced. I've broken my leg,
wrist, a couple of fingers...

474
00:40:54,885 --> 00:40:58,150
- Let me guess, driving accident?
- Summer camp.

475
00:40:58,189 --> 00:41:02,888
You know, one of those try and survive the
wilderness places. It's crazy.

476
00:41:02,927 --> 00:41:05,794
I've only be to one summer camp -
for gymnastics.

477
00:41:06,363 --> 00:41:08,661
They never told me you took gymnastics.

478
00:41:08,699 --> 00:41:10,667
Who's they?

479
00:41:13,537 --> 00:41:16,062
OK, that's it. I have to do something.

480
00:41:19,910 --> 00:41:22,003
Sorry.

481
00:41:23,814 --> 00:41:27,079
So, you do gymnastics. That's awesome.

482
00:41:29,587 --> 00:41:31,680
Thank you for your help...

483
00:41:41,298 --> 00:41:44,699
You know, you make
a really bad first impression,

484
00:41:44,735 --> 00:41:46,999
and a terrible second impression

485
00:41:47,037 --> 00:41:49,267
but the third time?

486
00:41:49,306 --> 00:41:52,935
- It's really good.
- You gotta see my fourth.

487
00:41:52,977 --> 00:41:54,968
I'd like that.

488
00:41:58,115 --> 00:42:01,573
Listen, it's kind of short notice but...

489
00:42:01,619 --> 00:42:03,746
I'm having a party this weekend and...

490
00:42:03,787 --> 00:42:06,187
- I'd love to!
- Great.

491
00:42:09,426 --> 00:42:12,589
Hello, I'm substituting for Miss Hatchett,
are you all right?

492
00:42:12,630 --> 00:42:15,497
Yes, I'm fine,
I just need to go back to class.

493
00:42:15,533 --> 00:42:20,095
- Glad this young man saved you?
- We don't need any help, Nurse.

494
00:42:20,137 --> 00:42:22,628
I see here that your birthday
is coming up.

495
00:42:22,673 --> 00:42:25,369
That's none of your business, "Nurse".

496
00:42:26,477 --> 00:42:28,138
I'm gonna go.

497
00:42:28,178 --> 00:42:32,478
Are you having a party? You should invite
Cody. Did you invite him?

498
00:42:32,516 --> 00:42:34,711
- Yes, I did.
- You did?

499
00:42:36,420 --> 00:42:40,288
Cody, I'll see you on Sunday.
The theme is Las Vegas.

500
00:42:40,324 --> 00:42:42,758
All right, see you there.

501
00:42:50,267 --> 00:42:53,464
Not a word. Not a word.

502
00:42:55,105 --> 00:42:59,041
Be friendly but keep a low profile,
you're not there to socialize.

503
00:42:59,076 --> 00:43:03,172
E.R.I.S. may have inserted agents -
casino dealers, catering staff.

504
00:43:03,213 --> 00:43:04,840
Anyone is suspect.

505
00:43:06,817 --> 00:43:09,581
And remember -
these are dangerous men.

506
00:43:09,620 --> 00:43:14,250
They'll think nothing of harming you.
So use caution.

507
00:43:15,326 --> 00:43:19,763
First floor of the house is a public area,
second floor is living space.

508
00:43:19,797 --> 00:43:22,391
Down on the beach
is Connors' personal lab.

509
00:43:22,433 --> 00:43:26,335
If you forget anything, the entire floor plan
is stored in your phone.

510
00:43:26,370 --> 00:43:28,964
We'll only be a couple of blocks away.

511
00:43:29,006 --> 00:43:30,906
Hold still.

512
00:43:31,942 --> 00:43:33,933
That really freaks me out.

513
00:43:34,979 --> 00:43:37,880
Sorry. Ready?

514
00:43:39,683 --> 00:43:42,379
Yeah. Let's go.

515
00:43:45,022 --> 00:43:47,183
Why don't you take it?

516
00:43:53,464 --> 00:43:55,955
- You did get him his license?
- Yeah.

517
00:44:13,951 --> 00:44:15,942
Here he comes.

518
00:44:21,558 --> 00:44:23,549
He's at the gate.

519
00:44:26,864 --> 00:44:30,027
- Name?
- Banks. Cody Banks.

520
00:44:30,067 --> 00:44:34,128
- You got some ID, Banks?
- You mean my driver's license?

521
00:44:34,171 --> 00:44:36,002
Yeah.

522
00:44:44,314 --> 00:44:47,647
There were no guns at my birthday party.

523
00:44:50,320 --> 00:44:52,311
- What's this?
- My cell phone.

524
00:44:54,291 --> 00:44:58,193
My MP3 player. You know
these stuffy parties, they get boring.

525
00:44:58,228 --> 00:45:00,093
Yeah, you have fun.

526
00:45:07,738 --> 00:45:09,433
He's in.

527
00:45:25,789 --> 00:45:28,781
We have to pass these out now.
I'm so over it.

528
00:45:31,228 --> 00:45:33,560
That's what I'm talkin' about!

529
00:45:40,871 --> 00:45:43,135
Guys, I'm 15, you know.

530
00:46:06,864 --> 00:46:08,855
I'll see you later.

531
00:46:18,008 --> 00:46:20,272
Sir? Another card for you.

532
00:46:22,179 --> 00:46:24,739
- How's your ankle?
- Much better.

533
00:46:24,782 --> 00:46:28,479
I better hold off
on the cartwheels for a while.

534
00:46:28,519 --> 00:46:31,386
- You don't want to have too much fun.
- No.

535
00:46:31,421 --> 00:46:34,515
Do you want something to drink
or anything?

536
00:46:34,558 --> 00:46:36,219
Happy birthday.

537
00:46:37,261 --> 00:46:38,592
Thank you.

538
00:46:42,332 --> 00:46:44,823
Wow, I love it, it's beautiful.

539
00:46:47,271 --> 00:46:49,739
- Can you help me?
- Oh, sure.

540
00:46:58,248 --> 00:47:00,273
Sorry.

541
00:47:00,317 --> 00:47:02,547
I'm kind of new at this.

542
00:47:09,827 --> 00:47:12,421
- Turquoise is my favorite.
- I know.

543
00:47:12,462 --> 00:47:15,454
- You're not supposed to know that.
- I know!

544
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:18,231
What?

545
00:47:18,268 --> 00:47:20,862
Sorry, just this stupid voice in my head.

546
00:47:24,675 --> 00:47:26,666
I have to go play hostess.

547
00:47:26,710 --> 00:47:29,611
I'm not surprised
to see that you're the first...

548
00:47:29,646 --> 00:47:31,705
Don't ever interrupt me again!

549
00:47:31,748 --> 00:47:34,239
If you don't watch it,
you're going in next.

550
00:47:34,284 --> 00:47:37,082
- It won't happen again, I promise.
- Yeah, right.

551
00:47:37,855 --> 00:47:39,846
Place your bets.

552
00:47:44,261 --> 00:47:46,320
10,000. Red seven.

553
00:47:48,665 --> 00:47:51,657
10,000. Black 13.

554
00:47:51,702 --> 00:47:54,136
No more bets.

555
00:47:55,606 --> 00:47:57,597
Red seven.

556
00:48:00,110 --> 00:48:01,634
Thank you.

557
00:48:05,749 --> 00:48:07,740
Sir, it's just play money.

558
00:48:35,846 --> 00:48:37,837
Guys?

559
00:48:40,083 --> 00:48:41,710
Brinkman.

560
00:49:01,171 --> 00:49:03,435
This way, Mr. Brinkman.

561
00:49:18,155 --> 00:49:21,488
- Let's see what they're up to.
- Wait till it's clear.

562
00:49:21,525 --> 00:49:24,392
I'll be OK, I'm going down.

563
00:50:22,586 --> 00:50:27,114
- I'm on the roof of the lab.
- Be careful, it's full of motion sensors.

564
00:51:07,064 --> 00:51:10,659
I hope you haven't spent
all our money on real estate.
