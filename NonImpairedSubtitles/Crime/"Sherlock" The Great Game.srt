MAN OUTSIDE SHOUTS COMMANDS

4
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:15,000
Just tell me what happened
from the beginning.

5
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:17,759
We had been to a bar,

6
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:22,479
nice place, and, er, I got chatting
with one of the waitresses,

7
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:26,959
and Karen weren't happy with that,
so...when we get back to the hotel,

8
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:29,119
we end up having
a bit of a ding-dong.

9
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:31,959
HE SIGHS

10
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:36,479
She's always getting at me,
saying I weren't a real man.

11
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:37,919
Wasn't a real man.

12
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:42,319
What?
It's not "weren't", it's "wasn't".

13
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:44,000
Oh.

14
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,039
Go on.

15
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:52,319
Well...then I don't know
how it happened,

16
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:54,720
but suddenly
there's a knife in my hands...

17
00:00:56,400 --> 00:01:00,279
..and me old man was a butcher,
so I know how to handle knives.

18
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:02,879
He learned us how to cut up a beast.
Taught.

19
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:05,079
What?
Taught you how to cut up a beast.

20
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:07,279
Yeah, well, then I done it.

21
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:09,639
Did it.
Did it! Stabbed her,

22
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:13,640
over and over and over, and I looked
down, and she weren't...

23
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:16,720
..wasn't...

24
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:18,880
..moving no more.

25
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:22,480
Any more.

26
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:29,679
God help me, I dunno how it happened,
but it was an accident, I swear.

27
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:32,320
You've got to help me, Mr Holmes!

28
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:35,319
Everyone says you're the best.

29
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:36,719
Without you...

30
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:39,239
I'll get hung for this.

31
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:41,440
No, no, Mr Bewick, not at all.

32
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:45,840
Hanged, yes.

33
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:26,720
TWO GUNSHOTS

34
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:37,759
DOOR OPENS

35
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:39,879
HE INHALES DEEPLY

36
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:41,480
DOOR SHUTS, HE SIGHS

37
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:43,880
GUNSHOTS

38
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:50,159
What the hell are you doing?!

39
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:51,599
Bored.
What?!

40
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:53,519
Bored!
No...

41
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:55,239
GUNSHOT Bored!

42
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:57,199
GUNSHOT Bored!

43
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:01,479
Don't know what's got into
the criminal classes.

44
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:04,799
Good job I'm not one of them.
So you take it out on the wall?

45
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,600
The wall had it coming.

46
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:16,919
What about that Russian case? Belarus?
Open and shut domestic murder. Not worth my time.

47
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:18,680
Oh, shame(!)

48
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:24,240
Anything in? I'm starving.

49
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:27,080
Oh, f...

50
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:37,279
There's a head.

51
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:39,679
A severed head!
Just tea for me, thanks.

52
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:43,359
No, there's a head in the fridge.
Yes? A bloody head! Well, where else

53
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:45,599
could I put it?
You don't mind, do you?

54
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:49,159
Well...
Got it from Barts morgue.

55
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:52,279
I'm measuring the coagulation
of saliva after death.

56
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:54,399
I see you've written up
the taxi driver case.

57
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,879
Er...yes.

58
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:58,919
A Study In Pink.

59
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:00,119
Nice.

60
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:02,599
Well, you know. Pink lady, pink case,

61
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:05,919
pink phone. There was a lot of pink.
Did you like it?

62
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:09,759
Um...no. Why not?
I thought you'd be flattered.

63
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:13,079
Flattered?! "Sherlock sees through
everything and everyone in seconds.

64
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:16,079
"What's incredible, though,
is how spectacularly ignorant he is

65
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:18,000
"about some things." Hang on,
I didn't mean that...

66
00:04:18,001 --> 00:04:20,919
Oh, you meant "spectacularly
ignorant" in a nice way(!)

67
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:25,399
Look, it doesn't matter to me who's Prime Minister or...
I know. ..who's sleeping with who...

68
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:28,519
Whether the Earth goes round the sun.
That again! It's not important!

69
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:30,079
Not impor...?!

70
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:35,079
It's primary school stuff. How can you not know that?
Well, if I ever did, I've deleted it.

71
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:36,999
Deleted it?

72
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:41,039
Listen. This is my hard drive,
and it only makes sense

73
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:44,239
to put things in there
that are useful. REALLY useful.

74
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:47,759
Ordinary people fill their heads
with all kinds of rubbish.

75
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:50,759
That makes it hard to get at
the stuff that matters. Do you see?

76
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:53,279
But it's the solar system!

77
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:57,919
Oh, hell! What does that matter?!
So we go round the sun. If we went round the moon,

78
00:04:57,920 --> 00:05:01,679
or round and round the garden like a teddy
bear, it wouldn't make any difference!

79
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:07,399
All that matters to me is the work!
Without that, my brain rots!

80
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:11,760
Put that in your blog! Or, better still,
stop inflicting your opinions on the world!

81
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:16,920
DOOR OPENS AND SHUTS

82
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:23,119
Where are you going?
Out! I need some air.

83
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:24,880
Oh, sorry, love! Sorry.

84
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:32,240
Ooh-ooh!
Have you two had a little domestic?

85
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:41,439
Ooh, it's a bit nippy out there.

86
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:45,000
He should have wrapped himself up
a bit more.

87
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:51,160
Look at that, Mrs Hudson.

88
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:53,959
Quiet.

89
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:55,800
Calm. Peaceful.

90
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:59,479
Isn't it hateful?

91
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:01,599
Oh, I'm sure something
will turn up, Sherlock.

92
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:05,519
A nice murder. That'll cheer you up.

93
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:07,399
Mmm. Can't come too soon.

94
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:10,120
Hey, what have you done
to my bloody wall?!

95
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:15,080
I'm putting this on your rent,
young man!

96
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:19,440
EXPLOSION BOOMS

97
00:06:19,441 --> 00:06:21,000
CAR ALARM BEEPS

98
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:23,520
GROANING

99
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:29,759
Morning. Oh...m-morning. See?
Told you you should have gone with the Lilo.

100
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:33,520
No, no, no, it's fine, I slept fine.
It's very kind of you.

101
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,439
Well, maybe next time I'll let you
kip at the end of my bed, you know.

102
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:46,199
NEWSREADER: '..which was discovered mouldering...
' What about the time after that? '..18 months ago.

103
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:49,519
'Experts are hailing it as
the artistic find of the century...'

104
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:53,679
Do you want some breakfast? Love some.
Well, make it yourself. I'm going to have a shower.

105
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:56,119
'..It fetched over £20 million.

106
00:06:56,120 --> 00:07:01,199

casualties, and the police are unable to say

109
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:11,960
'if there's any suspicion
of terrorist involvement.'

110
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:13,999

'Police have issued an emergency number...' Sarah! '..f

112
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:26,280
Excuse me, can I get through?
Excuse me. Can I get through?

113
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,320
I live over there.

114
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:42,479
DOOR BANGS Sherlock!

115
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:43,640
Sherlock!

116
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:50,679
PIZZICATO NOTE John.

117
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:52,999
I saw it on the telly. Are you OK?

118
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,319
Me? What? Oh, yeah, fine.

119
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:58,239
Gas leak, apparently.
PIZZICATO NOTE

120
00:07:58,240 --> 00:07:59,799
I can't.
Can't?

121
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:03,359
Stuff I've got on is just too big.
I can't spare the time.

122
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:06,719
Never mind your usual trivia.
This is of national importance.

123
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:09,279
PIZZICATO NOTE How's the diet?

124
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:11,159
Fine.

125
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:12,920
Perhaps you can get
through to him, John.

126
00:08:12,921 --> 00:08:15,959
What? I'm afraid my brother
can be very intransigent.

127
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:18,359
If you're so keen,
why don't you investigate it?

128
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:24,079
No. I can't possibly be away from the office for any
length of time. Not with the Korean elections so...

129
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:27,399
Well, you don't need to know
about that, do you?

130
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:32,319
Besides, a case like this,
it requires...legwork.

131
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:33,959
FALSE NOTE

132
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:35,760
How's Sarah, John?
How was the Lilo?

133
00:08:35,761 --> 00:08:37,879
Sofa, Sherlock. It was the sofa.

134
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:42,039
Oh, yes, of course.
How...? Oh, never mind.

135
00:08:42,040 --> 00:08:46,359
Sherlock's business seems to be
booming since you and he became...

136
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:48,999
pals. What's he like to live with?

137
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,679
Hellish, I imagine.
I'm never bored.

138
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:53,640
Good. That's good, isn't it?

139
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:06,599
Andrew West, known as Westie
to his friends. Civil servant.

140
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:09,679
Found dead on the tracks
at Battersea station this morning

141
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:11,319
with his head smashed in.

142
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:13,119
Jumped in front of a train?

143
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:15,919
Seems the logical assumption.

144
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:18,719
But?
But?

145
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:21,439
Well, you wouldn't be here
if it was just an accident.

146
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:22,439
Hah!

147
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:27,039
The MoD is working on a new missile defence
system, the Bruce-Partington Program it's called.

148
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:29,479
The plans for it
were on a memory stick.

149
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:31,400
That wasn't very clever.

150
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:35,959
It's not the only copy. Oh.
But it is secret.

151
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:37,159
And missing.

152
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:38,519
Top secret?

153
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:41,999
Very. We think West
must have taken the memory stick.

154
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,359
We can't risk it falling
into the wrong hands.

155
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:47,239
You've got to find those plans,
Sherlock.

156
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:52,359
Don't make me order you.
I'd like to see you try.

157
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:54,840
Think it over.

158
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:58,279
Goodbye, John.
Mm.

159
00:09:58,280 --> 00:10:00,360
See you very soon.

160
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:03,480
REPEATS RAPID PHRASE

161
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:14,719
FOOTSTEPS FADE

162
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:17,159
Why did you lie?

163
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:18,399
DOOR SHUTS

164
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:19,879
You've got nothing on.

165
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:22,679
Not a single case.
That's why the wall took a pounding.

166
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:25,919
Why did you tell your brother
you were busy? Why shouldn't I?

167
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:27,560
Oh.

168
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:29,760
Nice.

169
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:34,119
Sibling rivalry.
Now we're getting somewhere.

MOBILE PHONE RINGS

171
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:41,800
Sherlock Holmes.

172
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:46,959
Of course. How could I refuse?

173
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:48,639
Lestrade - I've been summoned.

174
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:50,239
Coming?

175
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:52,920
If you want me to. Of course.

176
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:56,200
I'd be lost without my blogger.

177
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:15,719
'You like the funny cases,
don't you?'

178
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:18,279
The surprising ones.
Obviously.

179
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:22,999
You'll love this. That explosion.
Gas leak, yes? No.

180
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,719
No? No. Made to look like one.
What?

181
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:28,999
Hardly anything left of the place,
except a strongbox.

182
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,199
A VERY strong box,
and inside it was this.

183
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:34,079
You haven't opened it?
It's addressed to you, isn't it?

184
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:38,040
We've X-rayed it. It's not
booby-trapped. How reassuring.

185
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:48,879
Nice stationery.

186
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:50,959
Bohemian.

187
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:52,479
What?

188
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:55,079
From the Czech Republic.
No fingerprints?

189
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:56,719
No.

190
00:11:56,720 --> 00:12:00,519
She used a fountain pen.
Parker Duofold, iridium nib.

191
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:01,999
She?
Obviously.

192
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,640
Obviously.

193
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:22,279
But that... That's the phone.
The pink phone.

194
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:26,879
What, from The Study In Pink? Obviously, it's not
the same phone, but it's supposed to look like...

195
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:29,479
"Study In Pink"? You read his blog?

196
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:31,159
Of course. We all do.

197
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:33,959
Do you REALLY not know that
the Earth goes round the sun?

SHE SNIGGERS

199
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:41,519
It isn't the same phone.
This one's brand-new.

200
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:48,480
Someone's taken trouble to make it look the same,
which means your blog has a far wider readership.

201
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:51,399
'You have one new message.'

202
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:57,079
FIVE GREENWICH TIME SIGNAL PIPS

203
00:12:57,080 --> 00:13:00,279
Was that it?
No, that's not it.

are we supposed to make of that?

206
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:10,959
An estate agent's photo
and the bloody Greenwich pips.

207
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:14,559
It's a warning.
A warning?

208
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:18,199
Some secret societies
used to send dried melon seeds,

209
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:21,520
orange pips, things like that -
five pips.

210
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:25,719
They're warning us
it's going to happen again.

211
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:28,159
I've seen this place before.
Hang on.

212
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:30,280
What's going to happen again?
Boom!

213
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:52,920
Mrs Hudson!

214
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:59,599
You had a look, didn't you, when you
first came to see about your flat?

215
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:01,279
The door's been opened, recently.

216
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:03,160
No, can't be. That's the only key.

217
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:06,919
I can't get anyone interested
in this flat.

218
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:09,759
It's the damp, I expect -
that's the curse of basements.

219
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:13,560
I'd a place once when I was first
married. Mould all up the wall...

220
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:17,360
Oh. Dear me.

221
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:35,360
Shoes.

222
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:39,360
He's a bomber, remember.

'I've...sent you...a little puzzle,

'just to say hi.'

'I'm typing.'

234
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:43,199
And this...stupid bitch

235
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:45,400
is reading it out.

236
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:49,880
The curtain rises.

237
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:53,679
What?
Nothing. No, what did you mean?

238
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:56,519
I've been expecting this
for some time.

239
00:15:56,520 --> 00:16:00,480
SOBBING: '12 hours to solve...'

00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:05,359
..my puzzle, Sherlock...

241
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:09,280
or I'm going to be...

242
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:13,200
..so...naughty.

243
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:50,040
So, who do you suppose it was?
Hmm?

244
00:16:50,041 --> 00:16:52,679
Woman on the phone -
the crying woman.

245
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:55,959
Oh, she doesn't matter,
she's just a hostage. No lead there.

246
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:59,520
I wasn't thinking about leads. You're
not going to be much use to her.

247
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:04,479
Are they trying to trace it -
trace the call?

248
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:07,079
Bomber's too smart for that.
MOBILE BEEPS Pass my phone.

Careful!

251
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:27,159
Text from your brother.

252
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:30,839
Delete it. Delete it? Plans are out
of the country. Nothing we can do.

253
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:34,679
Well, Mycroft thinks there is.
He's texted you eight times.

254
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:37,439
Must be important. Then why didn't
he cancel his dental appointment?

255
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:39,839
His what?
Mycroft never texts if he can talk.

256
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:44,039
Andrew West stole the missile plans, tried
to sell them, got his head smashed in,

257
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:45,119
end of story.

258
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:50,199
The only mystery is why my brother is so determined
to bore me when somebody is being so interesting.

259
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:52,199
Try and remember
there's a woman who might die.

260
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:56,319
What for? There's hospitals
full of people dying, Doctor.

261
00:17:56,320 --> 00:18:00,359
Why don't you go and cry by their

Oh, sorry. I didn't...
Jim, hi! Come in! Come in!

00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:17,039
Jim, this is Sherlock Holmes.
Ah.

266
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:21,799
And, er... Sorry.
John Watson. Hi.

267
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:24,879
Hi. So you're Sherlock Holmes.

268
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:29,799
Molly's told me all about you.
You on one of your cases?

269
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:31,679
Jim works in IT, upstairs.

270
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:34,759
That's how we met. Office romance.

Well, I'd better be off.

276
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,719
I'll see you at the Fox.

277
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:50,319

Yeah.

278

Bye.
Bye.

279
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:52,920
It was nice to meet you.

280
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:56,240

What do you mean, gay?
We're together.

283
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:11,039
Domestic bliss must suit you, Molly.
You've put on 3lb since I last saw you.

284
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:12,799
Two-and-a-half. No, three.

285
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:14,679
Sherlock.
He's not gay!

286
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:18,519
Why do you have to spoil...? He's
not! With that level of grooming?

287
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:21,679
Because he puts product in his
hair? I put product in my hair.

288
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:23,200
You wash your hair,
there's a difference.

289
00:19:23,201 --> 00:19:26,639
Tinted eyelashes, signs of taurine
cream around the frown lines,

290
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:28,639
those tired, clubber's eyes.

291
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:30,520
Then there's his underwear.
His underwear?

292
00:19:30,521 --> 00:19:33,479
Visible above the waistline.
Very particular brand.

293
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:37,439
Plus the suggestive fact that he
left his number under this dish.

294
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:40,640
I'd say you'd better break it off
now and save yourself the pain.

295
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:46,359
DOOR OPENS
Charming, well done(!)

296
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:48,759
Just saving her time.
Isn't that kinder?

297
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:51,880
Kinder? No, no, Sherlock,
that wasn't kind.

298
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:56,919
Go on, then.

299
00:19:56,920 --> 00:19:58,559
Hm?

300
00:19:58,560 --> 00:20:00,519
You know what I do. Off you go.

301
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:01,999
Oh... No.
Go on.

302
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,479
I'm not going to let you humiliate me
while I... An outside eye,

303
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:08,760
a second opinion - it's very useful
to me. Yeah, right(!) Really!

304
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:15,080
Fine.
CLEARS THROAT

305
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:22,480
Oh, they're just a pair of sh...
trainers. Good.

306
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:25,160
Um...

307
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:30,239
They're in good nick.
I'd say they were pretty new,

308
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:35,239
except the sole has been well worn, so the
owner must have had them for a while.

309
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:38,319
Er, very '80s.
Probably one of those retro designs.

310
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:41,639
You're on sparkling form.
What else?

311
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:44,599
They're quite big. A man's.

312
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:46,080
But...

313
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:50,840
But there's traces of a name
inside in felt-tip.

314
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:56,079
Adults don't write their names inside
their shoes, so these belong to a kid.

315
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:58,359
Excellent. What else?

316
00:20:58,360 --> 00:21:00,039
Er...

317
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:03,039
That's it.
That's it.

318
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:04,639
How did I do?
Well, John.

319
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:06,639
Really well.

320
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:10,680
I mean, you missed almost everything
of importance, but, you know...

321
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:14,399
The owner loved these.
Scrubbed them clean.

322
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:17,799
Whitened them. Changed the laces
three...no, four times.

323
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:23,199
There are traces of flaky skin where his fingers
have come into contact with them, so he had eczema.

324
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:26,679
The shoes are more worn on the
inner side, so he had weak arches.

325
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:28,239
British-made, 20 years old.

326
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:31,239
20 years? They're not retro,
they're original.

327
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:33,439
Limited edition -
two blue stripes, 1989.

328
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:36,159
There's still mud on them.
They look new.

329
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:39,039
Someone's kept them that way.

330
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:41,119
Quite a bit of mud caked
on the soles.

331
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:44,239
Analysis shows it's from Sussex
with London mud overlaying it.

332
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:48,159
How do you know? Pollen. Clear as a
map reference. South of the river.

333
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:53,239
This kid came to London from Sussex 20 years ago and
left the trainers behind. What happened to him?

334
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:54,879
Something bad.

335
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:57,959
He loved those shoes, remember.
He'd never leave them filthy.

336
00:21:57,960 --> 00:21:59,959
Wouldn't let them go
unless he had to.

337
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:02,760
So, a child with big feet gets...

338
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:06,880
Oh!

339
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:09,159
What?

340
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:11,239
Carl Powers.

341
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:16,399
Sorry, who?
Carl Powers, John.

342
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:18,040
What is it?

343
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:20,720
It's where I began.

344
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:30,159
1989, kid, champion swimmer, came from Brighton for
a school sports tournament, drowned in the pool.

345
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:33,319
Tragic accident. You wouldn't
remember it. But you remember.

346
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:35,039
Yes. Something fishy about it?

347
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:36,719
Nobody thought so.

348
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:41,439
Nobody except me. I was only a kid myself.
I read about it in the papers.

349
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:43,959
You started young, didn't you?
The boy, Carl Powers,

350
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:45,879
had some kind of fit in the water,

351
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:48,320
but by the time they got him out,
it was too late.

352
00:22:48,321 --> 00:22:51,759
There was something wrong somewhere.
I couldn't get it out of my head.

353
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:55,719
What? His shoes. What about them?
They weren't there. I made a fuss.

354
00:22:55,720 --> 00:23:00,399
I tried to get the police interested, but
nobody seemed to think it was important.

355
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:04,760
He'd left all the rest of his clothes in his
locker, but there was no sign of his shoes.

356
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:08,400
Until now.

He's texting me now.

363
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:54,960
How does he know my number?
Must be a root canal.

364
00:23:57,160 --> 00:24:00,839
Look, he did say...national
importance. Hmm!

00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:03,199
How quaint!

You are. Queen and country.

367
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:08,999
You can't just ignore it.
I'm not ignoring it.

368
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,639

John, how nice! I was hoping it wouldn't be long.
How can I help you?

372
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:24,679
Thank you.

373
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:27,439
Um, I was wanting to...

374
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:30,679
Your brother sent me to collect
more facts

375
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:34,439
about the stolen plans -
the missile plans.

376
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:39,079
Did he?
Yes. He's investigating now.

377
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:43,319
He's, er...investigating away.

378
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:46,160
I just wondered what else
you could tell me about the dead man.

379
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:51,239
Er, 27. Clerk at Vauxhall Cross.

380
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:52,559
MI6.

381
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:56,319
He was involved in the Bruce-Partington
Program in a minor capacity.

382
00:24:56,320 --> 00:25:01,039
Security checks A-OK.
No known terrorist affiliations or sympathies.

383
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:05,799
Last seen by his fiancee
10.30 yesterday evening.

384
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:08,559
Lucy, love, I've got to go out.

385
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:10,599
I've got to see someone.

386
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:13,359
Westie!

387
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:17,639
He was found at Battersea, yes.
So he got on the train?

388
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:20,079
No.
What?

389
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:22,520
He had an Oyster card...

390
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,959
..but it hadn't been used.
He must have bought a ticket.

391
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:30,479
Hm. There was no ticket on the body.

392
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:34,399
Then... How did he end up with a bashed-in
brain on the tracks at Battersea?

393
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:35,839
That is the question -

394
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:39,439
the one I was rather hoping Sherlock
would provide an answer to.

395
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:41,559
How's he getting on?

396
00:25:41,560 --> 00:25:43,519
He's fine.

397
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:46,919
And it is going...very well.

398
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:49,360
He's, um...
He's completely focused on it.

Poison!
What are you going on about?

401
00:26:04,321 --> 00:26:06,199
Clostridium botulinum.

402
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:09,559
It's one of the deadliest poisons
on the planet.

403
00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:11,679
Carl Powers.

404
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:14,279
Are you saying he was murdered?

405
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:17,039
Remember the shoelaces?
Mmm.

406
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:21,639
He suffered from eczema. It would be easy to
introduce the poison into his medication.

407
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:26,359
Two hours later he comes to London, the
poison paralyses the muscles and he drowns.

408
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:31,160
How come the autopsy didn't pick that up?
It's virtually undetectable. Nobody was looking for it.

409
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:35,519
There are still tiny traces of it
in the trainers

410
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:38,480
from where he put the cream
on his feet.

411
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:45,439
That's why they had to go. So how do we let the bomber know?
Get his attention, stop the clock.

412
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:48,600
The killer kept the shoes
all these years. Yes.

413
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:52,079
Meaning...
He's our bomber.

LESTRADE: She lives in Cornwall.

422
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:23,839
Two men broke in wearing masks,
forced her to drive to the car park

and decked her out in enough

City boy. Paid in cash.

461
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:59,479
Told his wife he was going away
on a business trip, never arrived.

You're still hanging round him.
Yeah, well...

Opposites attract, I s'pose.
We're not...

yes, it's Monkford's blood.

Get a sample sent to the lab.

468
00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:21,640
Oh...!

469
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:24,600
Mrs Monkford...

470
00:30:24,601 --> 00:30:28,399
Yes. Sorry, but I've already spoken
with two policemen.

471
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:30,280
We're not from the police, we're...

472
00:30:30,281 --> 00:30:33,679
TEARFULLY: Sherlock Holmes.
Very old friend of your husband's.

473
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:35,359
We, um...

474
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:37,799
we grew up together.

475
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:42,239
I'm sorry. Who? I don't think
he ever mentioned you.

476
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:44,439
Oh, he must have done. This is...

477
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:47,439
This is horrible.
I mean, I just can't believe it.

478
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:49,359
I only saw him the other day.

479
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:51,879
Same old Ian.
Not a care in the world.

480
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:58,160
Sorry... My husband has been
depressed for months. Who are you?

481
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:04,399
Really strange that he hired a car. Why would he do that?
It's a bit suspicious, isn't it?

482
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:07,679
No, it isn't. He forgot to renew
the tax on the car, that's all.

483
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:10,159
Ah, well! That was Ian.

484
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:12,799
That was Ian all over.
No, it wasn't.

485
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:15,520
NORMAL VOICE: Wasn't it? Interesting.

486
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:19,400
Who was that?
Why did you lie to her?

487
00:31:19,401 --> 00:31:24,359
People don't like telling you things but they love
to contradict you. Past tense, did you notice?

488
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:26,560
What? I referred to her husband
in the past tense.

489
00:31:26,561 --> 00:31:31,519
She joined in. Bit premature. They've only just found the car.
You think she murdered her husband?

490
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:34,479
That's not a mistake
a murderer would make. I see...

491
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:36,879
No, I don't. What am I seeing?
SALLY: Fishing.

492
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:40,119
Try fishing.
Where now?

493
00:31:40,120 --> 00:31:41,599
Janus Cars.

494
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:43,800
Just found this

Can't see how I can help you
gentlemen. Mr Monkford hired the car

497
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:59,159
from you yesterday.
Yeah, lovely motor.

498
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:02,159
Mazda RX8.
Wouldn't mind one of them myself.

499
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:03,999
Is that one?

500
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,039
No, they're all Jags.

501
00:32:06,040 --> 00:32:09,199
I can see you're not a car man, eh?

502
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:12,879
But surely you can afford one -
a Mazda, I mean. Yeah, fair point.

503
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:18,319
It's like working in a sweet shop. Once you start
eating the Liquorice Allsorts, where does it stop?

504
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:20,800
You didn't know Mr Monkford.
No, he was just a client.

505
00:32:20,801 --> 00:32:23,199
He came in here
and hired one of my cars.

506
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:25,399
I've no idea what happened to him.
Poor sod!

507
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:29,519
Nice holiday, Mr Ewart? Eh? You've
been away, haven't you? Oh, the...

508
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:31,839
No, it's sun beds, I'm afraid.

509
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:35,839
Too busy to get away. My wife
would love it, though - bit of sun.

510
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:40,879
Have you got any change for the cigarette machine?
What? I noticed one on the way in and I'm gasping.

00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:41,880

00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,719
No, sorry.

513
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:51,839
Oh, well! Thank you very much
for your time, Mr Ewart.

514
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:54,320
You've been very helpful.
Come on, John!

515
00:32:55,920 --> 00:33:00,759
I've got change, if you still want to...
Nicotine patches, remember? I'm doing well.

516
00:33:00,760 --> 00:33:04,079
So, what was all that about?
I needed to look inside his wallet.

517
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:06,280
Why?
Mr Ewart's a liar.

How much blood was on that seat,
would you say?

529
00:34:28,120 --> 00:34:29,919
How much? About a pint.

530
00:34:29,920 --> 00:34:32,719
Not about. Exactly a pint.
That was their first mistake.

531
00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:35,879
The blood's Ian Monkford's,
but it's been frozen.

532
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:38,439
Frozen?
There are clear signs.

533
00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:41,679
I think Ian Monkford gave
a pint of his blood some time ago

534
00:34:41,680 --> 00:34:46,199
and that's what they spread on the seat.
Who did? Janus Cars. The clue's in the name.

535
00:34:46,200 --> 00:34:48,879
The god with two faces?
Exactly.

536
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:53,479
They provide a very special service.
If you've got any kind of a problem - money troubles,

537
00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:57,119
bad marriage, whatever -
Janus Cars will help you disappear.

538
00:34:57,120 --> 00:35:01,879
Ian Monkford was in trouble - financial at a
guess, he's a banker - couldn't see a way out.

539
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:03,839
But if he were to vanish,

540
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:07,359
if the car he hired was found with
his blood on the driver's seat...

541
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:10,039
So where is he?
Colombia. Colombia?!

542
00:35:10,040 --> 00:35:12,399
Mr Ewart, of Janus Cars,

543
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:14,999
had a 20,000 Colombian peso note
in his wallet.

544
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,479
Quite a bit of change, too.

545
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:20,239
He told us he hadn't been abroad
recently,

546
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:23,999
but when I asked him about the cars,
I could see his tan line clearly.

547
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,480
No-one wears a shirt on a sun bed.

548
00:35:25,481 --> 00:35:27,439
That, plus his arm. His arm?

549
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:30,759
He kept scratching it. Obviously
irritating him, and bleeding.

550
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:34,799
He'd recently had a booster jab. Hep-B, probably.
Hard to tell at that distance.

551
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:38,679
He's just back from settling Ian
Monkford into his new life in Colombia.

552
00:35:38,680 --> 00:35:42,799
Mrs Monkford cashes in the life insurance,
and she splits it with Janus Cars.

553
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:45,279
Mrs Monkford?
Oh, yes. She's in on it too.

554
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:47,999
Go and arrest them, Inspector,
that's what you do best.

555
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,280
We need to let our bomber know
the case is solved.

Dead two days. According to one

600
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:02,679
she cut her hand on a rusty nail

It's a real shame. I liked her.

She taught you

It's how he got the tetanus into her system.

711
00:45:38,240 --> 00:45:40,879
Its paws stink of disinfectant.
Lovely idea.

712
00:45:40,880 --> 00:45:43,319
No, he coated it
onto the claws of her cat.

713
00:45:43,320 --> 00:45:46,319
It's a new pet,
bound to be a bit jumpy around her.

Nope. It was revenge.

Raoul, the houseboy.

fell out with her badly. It's all on the website.

She threatened to disinherit Kenny, Raoul had grown
accustomed to a certain lifestyle... Wait. Wait!

Wait a second. What about the

00:46:17,400 --> 00:46:19,840
Raoul keeps a very clean house.
You came through the kitchen door,

00:46:19,841 --> 00:46:22,519
saw the state of that floor -
scrubbed within an inch of its life.

No, the cat doesn't come into it.

Botox injection. Botox?

735

Botox is a diluted form
of botulinum. Among other things,

736
00:46:57,800 --> 00:47:01,799
Raoul de Santos was employed to give
Connie her regular facial injections.

My contact at the Home Office gave me the

He's been bulk-ordering Botox
for months.

739
00:47:07,521 --> 00:47:10,399
Bided his time, then upped
the strength to a fatal dose.

How long have you known?
Well, this one was quite simple.

That was a mistake.

00:47:23,481 --> 00:47:26,919
I knew I could save her.
I also knew that the bomber had given us 12 hours.

Well, usually, he...
must stay above it all.

772
00:49:01,720 --> 00:49:05,519
He organises these things,
but no-one ever has direct contact.

773
00:49:05,520 --> 00:49:10,799
What, like the Connie Prince murder,
he arranged that?

774
00:49:10,800 --> 00:49:14,919
So, people come to him wanting their
crimes fixed up, like booking a holiday?

775
00:49:14,920 --> 00:49:15,960
Novel.

776
00:49:18,400 --> 00:49:20,880
Huh!

777
00:49:22,640 --> 00:49:25,920
CAMERA SHUTTERS CLICK

778
00:49:31,680 --> 00:49:33,879
Taking his time this time.

779
00:49:33,880 --> 00:49:35,880
WATSON CLEARS HIS THROAT

780
00:49:37,680 --> 00:49:39,839
Anything on the Carl Powers case?

781
00:49:39,840 --> 00:49:42,119
Nothing.

782
00:49:42,120 --> 00:49:45,439
All the living classmates
check out spotless, no connection.

783
00:49:45,440 --> 00:49:48,559
Maybe the killer was older than Carl?
The thought had occurred.

784
00:49:48,560 --> 00:49:50,199
So why is he doing this, then?

785
00:49:50,200 --> 00:49:53,999
Playing this game with you.
Do you think he wants to be caught?

786
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:57,439
I think he wants to be distracted.
Oh...

787
00:49:57,440 --> 00:50:00,319
I hope you'll be
very happy together.

788
00:50:00,320 --> 00:50:04,839
Sorry, what?
There are lives at stake, Sherlock.

789
00:50:04,840 --> 00:50:08,199
Actual human lives! Just so I know,
do you care about that at all?

790
00:50:08,200 --> 00:50:11,199
Will caring about them
help save them? Nope.

791
00:50:11,200 --> 00:50:14,919
Then I'll continue not to make that mistake.
And you find that easy, do you? Yes, very.

792
00:50:14,920 --> 00:50:18,600
Is that news to you? No, no.

793
00:50:20,760 --> 00:50:22,239
I've disappointed you.

794
00:50:22,240 --> 00:50:24,599
That's good,
that's a good deduction, yeah.

795
00:50:24,600 --> 00:50:26,480
Don't make people into heroes, John.

796
00:50:26,481 --> 00:50:30,759
Heroes don't exist, and if they did,
I wouldn't be one of them.

797
00:50:30,760 --> 00:50:33,799
MOBILE PHONE BEEPS Excellent.

798
00:50:33,800 --> 00:50:35,719
A view of the Thames.

799
00:50:35,720 --> 00:50:39,040
South Bank, somewhere between
Southwark Bridge and Waterloo.

800
00:50:40,880 --> 00:50:44,119
You check the papers,
I'll look online.

801
00:50:44,120 --> 00:50:47,119
Oh, you're angry with me,
so you won't help.

802
00:50:47,120 --> 00:50:50,599
Not much cop, this caring lark.

803
00:50:50,600 --> 00:50:52,520
SIREN WAILS

804
00:51:09,240 --> 00:51:12,280
Archway suicide... Ten-a-penny.

805
00:51:14,600 --> 00:51:17,360
Two kids stabbed in Stoke Newington.

806
00:51:19,080 --> 00:51:23,039
Ah, man found on the train line,
Andrew West.

807
00:51:23,040 --> 00:51:24,559
Nothing!

808
00:51:24,560 --> 00:51:27,039
RINGING TONE

809
00:51:27,040 --> 00:51:32,040
It's me. Have you found anything on the South Bank
between Waterloo Bridge and Southwark Bridge?

810
00:51:39,320 --> 00:51:41,200
BIRDSONG

811
00:51:52,240 --> 00:51:54,440
Do you reckon this is connected,
then, the bomber?

812
00:51:54,441 --> 00:51:57,119
Must be. Odd, though,
he hasn't been in touch.

813
00:51:57,120 --> 00:52:00,479
Then we must assume that some poor
bugger's primed to explode, yeah?

814
00:52:00,480 --> 00:52:01,799
Yes.

815
00:52:01,800 --> 00:52:05,119
Any ideas? Seven, so far.

816
00:52:05,120 --> 00:52:06,600
Seven?

817
00:52:36,400 --> 00:52:39,599
He's dead about 24 hours.

818
00:52:39,600 --> 00:52:43,159
Maybe a bit longer. Did he drown?

819
00:52:43,160 --> 00:52:46,439
Apparently not. Not enough of the
Thames in his lungs. Asphyxiated.

820
00:52:46,440 --> 00:52:48,079
Yes, I'd agree.

821
00:52:48,080 --> 00:52:52,360
There's quite a bit of bruising
around the nose and mouth.

822
00:52:53,440 --> 00:52:56,159
More bruises...

823
00:52:56,160 --> 00:52:58,440
here and here.

824
00:53:02,080 --> 00:53:03,680
Fingertips.

825
00:53:05,240 --> 00:53:08,719
He's late 30s, I'd say,
not in the best condition.

826
00:53:08,720 --> 00:53:13,479
He's been in the river a long while, the
water's destroyed most of the data.

827
00:53:13,480 --> 00:53:17,599
But I'll tell you one thing,
that lost Vermeer painting's a fake.

828
00:53:17,600 --> 00:53:19,679
What?
We need to identify the corpse,

829
00:53:19,680 --> 00:53:21,159
find out about his friends and...

830
00:53:21,160 --> 00:53:23,639
Wait, wait, wait, wait. What
painting? What are you on about?

831
00:53:23,640 --> 00:53:25,840
It's all over the place,
haven't you seen the posters?

832
00:53:25,841 --> 00:53:28,479
Dutch old master, supposed to
have been destroyed centuries ago.

833
00:53:28,480 --> 00:53:31,079
Now it's turned up,
worth £30 million.

834
00:53:31,080 --> 00:53:33,759
OK, so what has that
got to do with the stiff?

835
00:53:33,760 --> 00:53:35,399
Everything.

836
00:53:35,400 --> 00:53:38,239
Have you ever heard of the Golem?
Golem?

837
00:53:38,240 --> 00:53:40,680
It's a horror story, isn't it?
What are you saying?

838
00:53:40,681 --> 00:53:44,639
Jewish folk story, a gigantic man made of
clay - it's also the name of an assassin.

839
00:53:44,640 --> 00:53:47,759
Real name - Oskar Dzundza.
One of the deadliest assassins in the world.

840
00:53:47,760 --> 00:53:49,759
That is his trademark style.

841
00:53:49,760 --> 00:53:51,639
So this is a hit? Definitely.

842
00:53:51,640 --> 00:53:54,879
The Golem squeezes the life out of
his victims with his bare hands.

843
00:53:54,880 --> 00:53:57,719
But what has this got to do
with that painting? I don't see...

844
00:53:57,720 --> 00:53:59,399
You do see, you just don't observe!

845
00:53:59,400 --> 00:54:01,160
Yes, all right, all right, girls!
Calm down.

846
00:54:01,161 --> 00:54:05,400
Sherlock, do you want to
take us through it?

847
00:54:08,120 --> 00:54:11,039
What do we know about this corpse?

848
00:54:11,040 --> 00:54:14,559
The killer's not left us with much,
just the shirt and the trousers.

849
00:54:14,560 --> 00:54:16,840
They're pretty formal, maybe
he was going out for the night.

850
00:54:16,841 --> 00:54:20,759
The trousers are heavy duty.
Polyester, nasty, same as the shirt, cheap.

851
00:54:20,760 --> 00:54:23,519
They're both too big for him. So
some kind of standard-issue uniform.

852
00:54:23,520 --> 00:54:25,320
Dressed for work, then.
What kind of work?

853
00:54:25,321 --> 00:54:28,079
There's a hook on his belt...
for a walkie-talkie.

854
00:54:28,080 --> 00:54:29,879
Tube driver?

855
00:54:29,880 --> 00:54:31,599
Security guard? More likely.

856
00:54:31,600 --> 00:54:33,679
That'll be borne out
by his backside. Backside?!

857
00:54:33,680 --> 00:54:35,919
Flabby, you'd think he'd led
a sedentary life.

858
00:54:35,920 --> 00:54:40,479
Yet the soles of his feet and the nascent
varicose veins in his legs show otherwise.

859
00:54:40,480 --> 00:54:44,239
So, a lot of walking
and a lot of sitting around.

860
00:54:44,240 --> 00:54:46,680
Security guard's looking good.
The watch helps too.

861
00:54:46,681 --> 00:54:48,759
The alarm shows
he did regular night shifts.

862
00:54:48,760 --> 00:54:51,399
Maybe he just set his alarm
like that the night before he died.

863
00:54:51,400 --> 00:54:54,599
No, no, no. The buttons are stiff,
hardly touched.

864
00:54:54,600 --> 00:54:57,159
He set his alarm like that a long
time ago, his routine never varied.

865
00:54:57,160 --> 00:54:58,879
But there's something else. The
killer must have been interrupted,

866
00:54:58,880 --> 00:55:00,519
otherwise he would have
stripped the corpse completely.

867
00:55:00,520 --> 00:55:02,720
There was some kind of badge
or insignia on the shirt front

868
00:55:02,721 --> 00:55:05,959
that he tore off, suggesting the dead
man works somewhere recognisable,

869
00:55:05,960 --> 00:55:07,599
some kind of institution.

870
00:55:07,600 --> 00:55:11,439
I found this
inside his trouser pockets.

871
00:55:11,440 --> 00:55:15,199
Sodden by the river,
but still recognisably...

872
00:55:15,200 --> 00:55:18,519
Tickets? Ticket stubs. He worked in a
museum or gallery. Did a quick check.

873
00:55:18,520 --> 00:55:22,719
The Hickman Gallery has reported one of its
attendants as missing - Alex Woodbridge.

874
00:55:22,720 --> 00:55:25,599
Tonight, they unveil
the rediscovered masterpiece.

875
00:55:25,600 --> 00:55:27,759
Now, why would anyone
want to pay the Golem

876
00:55:27,760 --> 00:55:30,959
to suffocate a perfectly ordinary
gallery attendant?

877
00:55:30,960 --> 00:55:33,199
Inference, the dead man
knew something about it,

878
00:55:33,200 --> 00:55:36,199
something that would stop the owner
getting paid £30 million.

879
00:55:36,200 --> 00:55:38,959
The pictures are fake. Fantastic.

880
00:55:38,960 --> 00:55:42,200
Meretricious. And a Happy New Year.

881
00:55:43,320 --> 00:55:44,320
Poor sod.

882
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:48,439
I'd better get my feelers out
for this Golem character.

883
00:55:48,440 --> 00:55:50,920
Pointless, you'll never find him,
but I know a man who can.

884
00:55:50,921 --> 00:55:53,120
Who? Me.

885
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:02,640
Why hasn't he phoned?
He's broken his pattern. Why?

886
00:56:05,080 --> 00:56:07,959
Waterloo Bridge.
Where now, the gallery?

887
00:56:07,960 --> 00:56:09,879
In a bit.

888
00:56:09,880 --> 00:56:11,800
The Hickman's contemporary art,
isn't it?

889
00:56:11,801 --> 00:56:14,439
Why have they got hold
of an old master? Don't know.

890
00:56:14,440 --> 00:56:17,519
Dangerous to jump to conclusions.

891
00:56:17,520 --> 00:56:18,960
Need data...

892
00:56:36,120 --> 00:56:37,239
Stop!

893
00:56:37,240 --> 00:56:39,439
Can you wait here?

894
00:56:39,440 --> 00:56:41,559
I won't be a moment.

895
00:56:41,560 --> 00:56:43,040
Sherlock?

896
00:56:50,080 --> 00:56:52,719
Change? Any change?

897
00:56:52,720 --> 00:56:55,639
What for? Cup of tea, of course.

898
00:56:55,640 --> 00:56:57,919
Here you go, 50.

899
00:56:57,920 --> 00:56:59,640
Thanks.

900
00:57:01,440 --> 00:57:03,760
What are you doing? Investing.

901
00:57:13,720 --> 00:57:17,360
Now we go to the gallery.
Have you got any cash?

902
00:57:30,640 --> 00:57:34,239
No, I need you to find out all
you can about the gallery attendant.

903
00:57:34,240 --> 00:57:38,080
Lestrade will give you the address.
OK.

904
00:57:51,040 --> 00:57:53,599
We'd been sharing about a year.

905
00:57:53,600 --> 00:57:55,760
Just sharing. Mmm.

906
00:58:06,800 --> 00:58:09,120
May I? Yeah.

907
00:58:10,640 --> 00:58:13,039
Sorry.

908
00:58:13,040 --> 00:58:14,759
Stargazer, was he?

909
00:58:14,760 --> 00:58:17,559
God, yeah. Mad about it.

910
00:58:17,560 --> 00:58:20,279
It's all he ever did
in his spare time.

911
00:58:20,280 --> 00:58:22,759
He was a nice guy, Alex.

912
00:58:22,760 --> 00:58:25,759
I liked him.

913
00:58:25,760 --> 00:58:28,119
He was, er...

914
00:58:28,120 --> 00:58:30,280
never much of a one for hoovering.

915
00:58:32,800 --> 00:58:35,519
What about art?
Did he know anything about that?

916
00:58:35,520 --> 00:58:38,079
It was just a job, you know?

917
00:58:38,080 --> 00:58:39,280
Mmm.

918
00:58:41,840 --> 00:58:45,319
Has anyone else been round
asking about Alex?

919
00:58:45,320 --> 00:58:46,519
No.

920
00:58:46,520 --> 00:58:48,959
We had a break-in, though.

921
00:58:48,960 --> 00:58:50,839
When? Last night.

922
00:58:50,840 --> 00:58:52,959
There was nothing taken.

923
00:58:52,960 --> 00:58:57,919
Oh, there was a message
left for Alex on the land line.

924
00:58:57,920 --> 00:59:02,440
Who was it from? I can play it for you, if you like.
I'll get the phone. Please.

925
00:59:06,800 --> 00:59:09,039

936
00:59:55,920 --> 00:59:57,879
Just admiring the view.

937
00:59:57,880 --> 00:59:59,639
Yes.

938
00:59:59,640 --> 01:00:02,120
Lovely. Now get back to work -
we open tonight.

939
01:00:03,720 --> 01:00:05,879
Doesn't it bother you? What?

940
01:00:05,880 --> 01:00:08,239
That the painting's a fake.

941
01:00:08,240 --> 01:00:12,119
What? It's a fake. It has to be.
It's the only possible explanation.

942
01:00:12,120 --> 01:00:15,679
You are in charge, aren't you,
Miss Wenceslas? Who are you?

943
01:00:15,680 --> 01:00:17,759
Alex Woodbridge
knew that the painting was a fake,

944
01:00:17,760 --> 01:00:19,679
so somebody sent the Golem
to take care of him. Was it you?

945
01:00:19,680 --> 01:00:21,640
Golem? What the hell
are you talking about?

946
01:00:21,641 --> 01:00:24,399
Are you working for someone else?
Did you fake it for them?

947
01:00:24,400 --> 01:00:25,879
It's not a fake.

948
01:00:25,880 --> 01:00:27,679
It is a fake. I don't know why.

949
01:00:27,680 --> 01:00:29,960
But there's something wrong with it,
there has to be.

950
01:00:29,961 --> 01:00:33,999
What the hell are you on about? You know I could
have you sacked on the spot. Not a problem.

951
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:35,799
No? No, I don't work here, you see.

952
01:00:35,800 --> 01:00:38,080
Just popped in to give you
a bit of friendly advice.

953
01:00:38,081 --> 01:00:39,799
How did you get in?

954
01:00:39,800 --> 01:00:41,999
Please! I want to know.

955
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:45,319
The art of disguise is knowing
how to hide in plain sight.

956
01:00:45,320 --> 01:00:47,199
Who are you? Sherlock Holmes.

01:00:49,640 --> 01:00:51,879

01:01:12,840 --> 01:01:18,159
Stranger things have happened.
Westie wasn't a traitor.

963
01:01:18,160 --> 01:01:19,919
That's a horrible thing to say!

964
01:01:19,920 --> 01:01:22,759
I'm sorry.
But you must understand...

965
01:01:22,760 --> 01:01:25,439
That's what they think, isn't it,
his bosses?

966
01:01:25,440 --> 01:01:27,999
He was young man, about to
get married, he had debts.

967
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:30,759
Everyone's got debts,

968
01:01:30,760 --> 01:01:34,159
and Westie wouldn't want to clear
them by selling out his country.

969
01:01:34,160 --> 01:01:39,399
Can you, er...? Can you tell me
exactly what happened that night?

970
01:01:39,400 --> 01:01:42,519
We were having a night in.

971
01:01:42,520 --> 01:01:45,519
Just...watching a DVD.

972
01:01:45,520 --> 01:01:48,960
He normally falls asleep, you know,
but he sat through this one.

973
01:01:50,760 --> 01:01:52,360
He was quiet.

974
01:01:54,440 --> 01:01:58,079
Out of the blue he said
he just had to go and see someone.

975
01:01:58,080 --> 01:01:59,320
And you've no idea who?

976
01:02:07,120 --> 01:02:09,759
Hi, Liz. You OK, love?

977
01:02:09,760 --> 01:02:11,919
Yeah. Who's this?

978
01:02:11,920 --> 01:02:15,559
John Watson, hi.
This is my brother, Joe.

979
01:02:15,560 --> 01:02:17,800
John's trying to find out
what happened to Westie, Joe.

980
01:02:17,801 --> 01:02:20,079
You with the police?
Sort of, yeah.

981
01:02:20,080 --> 01:02:23,039
Tell them to get off their arses,
will you? It's bloody ridiculous.

982
01:02:23,040 --> 01:02:24,520
I'll do my best.

983
01:02:29,720 --> 01:02:31,759
CLEARS THROAT Well, er,

984
01:02:31,760 --> 01:02:36,599
thanks very much for your help.
Again, I'm very, very sorry.

985
01:02:36,600 --> 01:02:39,160
He didn't steal those things,
Mr Watson.

986
01:02:40,320 --> 01:02:43,559
I knew Westie, he was a good man.

987
01:02:43,560 --> 01:02:46,040
He was MY good man.

988
01:03:09,200 --> 01:03:11,199
Spare change? No.

989
01:03:11,200 --> 01:03:13,600
Any spare change?

990
01:03:20,240 --> 01:03:22,959
Alex Woodbridge didn't know
anything special about art.

991
01:03:22,960 --> 01:03:24,599
And? And...

992
01:03:24,600 --> 01:03:27,159
Is that it?
No habits, hobbies, personality?

993
01:03:27,160 --> 01:03:29,439
Give us a chance.
He was an amateur astronomer.

WATSON: Can you wait here?

996
01:03:37,520 --> 01:03:42,120
Fortunately, I haven't been idle.
Come on.

997
01:04:05,040 --> 01:04:06,720
Beautiful, isn't it?

998
01:04:09,680 --> 01:04:14,359

Doesn't mean I can't appreciate it.

999
01:04:14,360 --> 01:04:18,159
Listen, Alex Woodbridge had a message
on the answerphone at his flat.

1003
01:04:30,680 --> 01:04:33,799
Really is indispensable.
Homeless network?

1004
01:04:33,800 --> 01:04:37,199
My eyes and ears, all over the city.
Ah, that's...clever.

1005
01:04:37,200 --> 01:04:41,200
So you scratch their backs, and...?
Yes, then disinfect myself.

1006

What's he doing sleeping rough?

1008
01:05:06,880 --> 01:05:11,599
Well, he has a very distinctive look.
He has to hide somewhere where tongues won't wag...much.

1009
01:05:11,600 --> 01:05:12,759

Exploding star.
Only appeared in the sky in 1858.

1079
01:09:33,640 --> 01:09:36,719
So how could it have been...

1080
01:09:36,720 --> 01:09:40,719
painted in the 1640s?

1081
01:09:40,720 --> 01:09:44,399
PHONE BEEPS Oh...

1082
01:09:44,400 --> 01:09:45,919
Oh.

1083
01:09:45,920 --> 01:09:48,320
Oh, Sherl...

1084
01:09:51,720 --> 01:09:54,799
You know, it's interesting.
Bohemian stationery,

1085
01:09:54,800 --> 01:09:59,279
an assassin named after a Prague
legend, and you, Miss Wenceslas.

1086
01:09:59,280 --> 01:10:02,359
This whole case has a distinctly
Czech feeling about it.

1087
01:10:02,360 --> 01:10:03,800
Is that where this leads?

1088
01:10:05,600 --> 01:10:08,559
What are we looking at, Inspector?

1089
01:10:08,560 --> 01:10:11,279
Well, criminal conspiracy, fraud,

1090
01:10:11,280 --> 01:10:14,559
accessory after the fact,
at the very least.

1091
01:10:14,560 --> 01:10:16,960
The murder of the old woman,
all the people in the flat...

1092
01:10:16,961 --> 01:10:19,359
I didn't know anything about that.

1093
01:10:19,360 --> 01:10:22,000
All those things, please,
believe me.

1094
01:10:24,040 --> 01:10:26,799
I just wanted my share.

1095
01:10:26,800 --> 01:10:28,320
The 30 million.

1096
01:10:35,040 --> 01:10:36,919
SHE SIGHS

1097
01:10:36,920 --> 01:10:39,080
I found a little old man in
Argentina.

1098
01:10:40,960 --> 01:10:43,959
A genius - I mean, really.

1099
01:10:43,960 --> 01:10:45,919
Brushwork, immaculate.

1100
01:10:45,920 --> 01:10:49,519
Could fool anyone. Mmm.

1101
01:10:49,520 --> 01:10:51,040
Well, nearly anyone.

1102
01:10:54,200 --> 01:10:58,200
But I didn't know how to go about convincing
the world the picture was genuine.

1103
01:10:59,680 --> 01:11:01,520
It was just an idea.

1104
01:11:03,120 --> 01:11:05,759
A spark which he blew into a flame.

1105
01:11:05,760 --> 01:11:07,479
Who?

1106
01:11:07,480 --> 01:11:09,079
I don't know.

1107
01:11:09,080 --> 01:11:11,639
LESTRADE LAUGHS It's true!

1108
01:11:11,640 --> 01:11:15,319
It took a long time,
but eventually I was...

1109
01:11:15,320 --> 01:11:17,120
put in touch with people.

1110
01:11:19,520 --> 01:11:21,760
His people...

1111
01:11:23,040 --> 01:11:25,560
Well, there was never any real
contact.

1112
01:11:27,400 --> 01:11:30,440
Just messages...

1113
01:11:32,440 --> 01:11:35,559
..whispers.

1114
01:11:35,560 --> 01:11:38,800
And did those whispers have a name?

1115
01:11:48,040 --> 01:11:49,800
Moriarty.

1116
01:12:05,080 --> 01:12:07,759
WATSON: So this is where West was
found? Yeah.

1117
01:12:07,760 --> 01:12:10,119
Are you going to be long?
I might be.

1118
01:12:10,120 --> 01:12:12,119
Are you the police, then?
Sort of.

1119
01:12:12,120 --> 01:12:13,959
I hate 'em. The police?

1120
01:12:13,960 --> 01:12:15,559
No, jumpers.

1121
01:12:15,560 --> 01:12:19,279
People who chuck 'emselves in
front of trains. Selfish bastards.

1122
01:12:19,280 --> 01:12:22,079
Well, that's one way of looking
at it.

1123
01:12:22,080 --> 01:12:24,559
I mean it. It's all right for them.

1124
01:12:24,560 --> 01:12:28,519
It's over in a split second, strawberry jam all
over the lines. What about the drivers, eh?

1125
01:12:28,520 --> 01:12:30,679
They've got to live with it,
haven't they?

1126
01:12:30,680 --> 01:12:34,679
Yeah, speaking of strawberry jam,
there's no blood on the line.

1127
01:12:34,680 --> 01:12:38,359
Has it been cleaned off?
No, there wasn't that much.

1128
01:12:38,360 --> 01:12:41,840
You said his head was smashed in.
It was, but there wasn't much blood.

1129
01:12:43,760 --> 01:12:49,479
OK.
Well, I'll leave you to it, then.

1130
01:12:49,480 --> 01:12:52,839
Just give us a shout when
you're off. Right.

1131
01:12:52,840 --> 01:13:00,679
Right, so, Andrew West...got on
the train somewhere. Or did he?

1132
01:13:00,680 --> 01:13:03,320
There was no ticket on the body.

1133
01:13:04,880 --> 01:13:06,759
How did he end up here?

1134
01:13:06,760 --> 01:13:08,320
CLANKING

1135
01:13:14,280 --> 01:13:15,719
The points. Yes!

1136
01:13:15,720 --> 01:13:17,959
I knew you'd get there eventually.

1137
01:13:17,960 --> 01:13:20,599
West wasn't killed here, that's
why there was so little blood.

1138
01:13:20,600 --> 01:13:22,840
How long have you been following
me? Since the start.

1139
01:13:22,841 --> 01:13:25,759
You don't think
I'd give up on a case like this

1140
01:13:25,760 --> 01:13:27,639
just to spite my brother, do you?

1141
01:13:27,640 --> 01:13:31,040
Come on,
we've got a bit of burglary to do.

1142
01:13:35,360 --> 01:13:37,439
Missile defence plans
haven't left the country,

1143
01:13:37,440 --> 01:13:40,079
otherwise Mycroft's people
would have heard about it.

1144
01:13:40,080 --> 01:13:43,359
Despite what people think,
we do still have a secret service.

1145
01:13:43,360 --> 01:13:45,599
Yeah, I know, I've met them.

1146
01:13:45,600 --> 01:13:48,119
Which means whoever stole
the memory stick can't sell it

1147
01:13:48,120 --> 01:13:49,760
or doesn't know what to do with it.

1148
01:13:49,761 --> 01:13:51,639
My money's on the latter.

1149
01:13:51,640 --> 01:13:53,239
We're here.

1150
01:13:53,240 --> 01:13:54,880
Where?

1151
01:14:03,680 --> 01:14:06,960
Sherlock! What if there's
someone in?

1152
01:14:08,480 --> 01:14:10,680
There isn't.

1153
01:14:13,480 --> 01:14:14,680
WATSON: Jesus...

1154
01:14:16,120 --> 01:14:19,519
Where are we? Oh, sorry, didn't
I say? Joe Harrison's flat.

1155
01:14:19,520 --> 01:14:21,000
Joe...?

1156
01:14:23,400 --> 01:14:27,159
Brother of West's fiancee.
He stole the memory stick,

1157
01:14:27,160 --> 01:14:29,480
killed his prospective
brother-in-law.

1158
01:14:42,440 --> 01:14:44,559
Then why did he do it?

1159
01:14:44,560 --> 01:14:46,519
KEYS RATTLING

1160
01:14:46,520 --> 01:14:48,040
Let's ask him.

1161
01:14:58,320 --> 01:14:59,760
Don't! Don't.

1162
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:08,000
He wasn't meant to...

1163
01:15:10,520 --> 01:15:13,759
What's Lucy gonna say? Jesus.

1164
01:15:13,760 --> 01:15:15,040
Why did you kill him?

1165
01:15:15,041 --> 01:15:18,239
It was an accident. I swear it was.

1166
01:15:18,240 --> 01:15:23,159
But stealing the plans for the missile
defence program wasn't an accident, was it?

1167
01:15:23,160 --> 01:15:25,320
I started dealing drugs.

1168
01:15:26,920 --> 01:15:29,239
I mean, the bike thing's
a great cover, right?

1169
01:15:29,240 --> 01:15:31,799
I don't know how it started.

1170
01:15:31,800 --> 01:15:34,239
I just got out of my depth.

1171
01:15:34,240 --> 01:15:38,679
I owed people thousands.
Serious people.

1172
01:15:38,680 --> 01:15:43,320
Then at Westie's engagement do,
he starts talking about his job.

1173
01:15:45,800 --> 01:15:48,399
I mean, usually, he's so careful.

1174
01:15:48,400 --> 01:15:53,279
'But that night, after a few pints,
he really opened up.

1175
01:15:53,280 --> 01:15:55,559
'He told me about these
missile plans.

1176
01:15:55,560 --> 01:15:58,239
'Beyond top secret.

1177
01:15:58,240 --> 01:16:02,119
'He showed me the memory stick,
he waved it in front of me.'

1178
01:16:02,120 --> 01:16:04,879
You hear about these things
getting lost,

1179
01:16:04,880 --> 01:16:06,919
ending up on rubbish tips
and whatnot.

1180
01:16:06,920 --> 01:16:10,239
But there it was. And I thought...

1181
01:16:10,240 --> 01:16:13,279
'Well, I thought
it could be worth a fortune.

1182
01:16:13,280 --> 01:16:16,320
'It was pretty easy to get the thing
off him, he was so plastered.'

1183
01:16:18,920 --> 01:16:21,199
Next time I saw him,

1184
01:16:21,200 --> 01:16:24,479
'I could tell by the look on his
face that he knew.'

1185
01:16:24,480 --> 01:16:28,479
What are you doing here?
What have you done with the plans?

1186
01:16:28,480 --> 01:16:31,080
What happened?

1187
01:16:36,320 --> 01:16:40,319
'I was going to call an ambulance,
but it was too late.

1188
01:16:40,320 --> 01:16:45,719
'I just didn't have a clue what
to do. So I dragged him in 'ere.'

1189
01:16:45,720 --> 01:16:49,000
I just sat in the dark, thinking.

1190
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:52,440
When a neat little idea
popped into your head.

1191
01:17:32,920 --> 01:17:37,679
Carrying Andrew West way away from here.
His body would have gone on for ages

1192
01:17:37,680 --> 01:17:40,759
if the train hadn't hit
a stretch of track that curved.

1193
01:17:40,760 --> 01:17:42,880
And points. Exactly.

1194
01:17:46,280 --> 01:17:49,120
Do you still have it, then -
the memory stick?

1195
01:17:50,640 --> 01:17:53,640
Fetch it for me,
if you wouldn't mind.

1196
01:18:03,080 --> 01:18:05,199
Distraction over -
the game continues.

1197
01:18:05,200 --> 01:18:07,839
Maybe that's over, too.
We've heard nothing from the bomber.

1198
01:18:07,840 --> 01:18:09,280
Five pips, remember, John.

1199
01:18:09,281 --> 01:18:13,119
It's a countdown.
We've only had four.

1200
01:18:13,120 --> 01:18:16,679
SHOUTING ON TELEVISION

1201
01:18:16,680 --> 01:18:21,319
No, no, no!
Course he's not the boy's father.

1202
01:18:21,320 --> 01:18:23,520
Look at the turn-ups on his jeans!

1203
01:18:25,120 --> 01:18:27,839
I knew it was dangerous. Hm?

1204
01:18:27,840 --> 01:18:29,999
Getting you into crap telly.

1205
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:32,799
Not a patch on Connie Prince.

1206
01:18:32,800 --> 01:18:37,199
Have you given Mycroft the memory
stick yet? Yep. He was over the moon.

1207
01:18:37,200 --> 01:18:41,040
Threatened me with a
knighthood...again.

1208
01:18:41,720 --> 01:18:44,799
You know, I'm still waiting. Hm?

1209
01:18:44,800 --> 01:18:47,759
For you to admit that a little
knowledge of the solar system

1210
01:18:47,760 --> 01:18:50,359
and you'd have cleared up
the fake painting a lot quicker.

1211
01:18:50,360 --> 01:18:51,959
It didn't do you any good, did it?

1212
01:18:51,960 --> 01:18:54,519
No, but I'm not the world's
only consulting detective.

1213
01:18:54,520 --> 01:18:56,199
True. I won't be in for tea.

1214
01:18:56,200 --> 01:19:00,319
I'm going to Sarah's. There's still some
of that risotto left in the fridge.

1215
01:19:00,320 --> 01:19:02,919
Milk, we need milk. I'll get some.

1216
01:19:02,920 --> 01:19:04,680
Really? Really.

1217
01:19:06,920 --> 01:19:09,560
And some beans, then? Mm.

1218
01:19:17,480 --> 01:19:19,200
DOOR CLOSES

1219
01:19:47,840 --> 01:19:50,600
FOOTSTEPS

1220
01:20:22,640 --> 01:20:26,639
Bought you a little
getting-to-know-you present.

1221
01:20:26,640 --> 01:20:29,200
That's what it's all been for,
isn't it?

1222
01:20:31,840 --> 01:20:34,119
All your little puzzles,
making me dance.

1223
01:20:34,120 --> 01:20:37,520
All to distract me from this.

1224
01:20:49,640 --> 01:20:51,120
Evening.

1225
01:20:56,240 --> 01:20:58,679
This is a turn-up, isn't it,
Sherlock?

1226
01:20:58,680 --> 01:21:02,840
John! What the hell...?
Bet you never saw this coming.

1227
01:21:09,640 --> 01:21:16,280
What...would you like me
to make him say...next?

1228
01:21:18,080 --> 01:21:21,239
Gottle o' gear, gottle o' gear,

1229
01:21:21,240 --> 01:21:23,199
gottle o' gear. Stop it.

1230
01:21:23,200 --> 01:21:26,479
Nice touch, this. The pool,

1231
01:21:26,480 --> 01:21:28,999
where little Carl died.

1232
01:21:29,000 --> 01:21:34,719
I stopped him.
I can stop John Watson, too.

1233
01:21:34,720 --> 01:21:39,599
Stop his heart. Who are you?

1234
01:21:39,600 --> 01:21:41,039
DOOR OPENS

1235
01:21:41,040 --> 01:21:43,759
I gave you my number.

1236
01:21:43,760 --> 01:21:46,360
I thought you might call.

1237
01:22:00,600 --> 01:22:03,999
Is that a British Army Browning
L9A1 in your pocket,

1238
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:07,520
or are you just pleased to see me?

1239
01:22:08,560 --> 01:22:09,840
Both.

1240
01:22:11,920 --> 01:22:15,400
Jim Moriarty. Hi.

1241
01:22:17,640 --> 01:22:19,799
Jim?

1242
01:22:19,800 --> 01:22:21,920
Jim from the hospital?

1243
01:22:24,320 --> 01:22:27,079
Oh, did I really make
such a fleeting impression?

1244
01:22:27,080 --> 01:22:30,440
But then, I suppose,
that was rather the point.

1245
01:22:32,320 --> 01:22:36,719
Don't be silly.
Someone else is holding the rifle.

1246
01:22:36,720 --> 01:22:38,760
I don't like getting my hands dirty.

1247
01:22:42,240 --> 01:22:47,319
I've given you a glimpse,
Sherlock, just a teensy glimpse

1248
01:22:47,320 --> 01:22:51,999
of what I've got going on
out there in the big bad world.

1249
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:55,399
I'm a specialist, you see.

1250
01:22:55,400 --> 01:22:57,039
Like you.

1251
01:22:57,040 --> 01:22:58,520
Dear Jim...

1252
01:23:00,360 --> 01:23:03,759
..please will you fix it for me

1253
01:23:03,760 --> 01:23:07,039
to get rid of my lover's
nasty sister?

1254
01:23:07,040 --> 01:23:10,879
Dear Jim, please will you fix it for
me to disappear to South America?

1255
01:23:10,880 --> 01:23:12,479
Just so.

1256
01:23:12,480 --> 01:23:15,559
Consulting criminal.

1257
01:23:15,560 --> 01:23:19,399
Brilliant. Isn't it?

1258
01:23:19,400 --> 01:23:22,320
No-one ever gets to me.

1259
01:23:24,160 --> 01:23:25,799
And no-one ever will.

1260
01:23:25,800 --> 01:23:27,000
I did.
COCKS GUN

1261
01:23:27,001 --> 01:23:29,319
You've come the closest.
Now you're in my way.

1262
01:23:29,320 --> 01:23:31,160
Thank you.
Didn't mean it as a compliment.

1263
01:23:31,161 --> 01:23:33,319
Yes, you did. Yeah, OK, I did.

1264
01:23:33,320 --> 01:23:35,079
But the flirting's over, Sherlock.

1265
01:23:35,080 --> 01:23:38,039
SINGSONG
Daddy's had enough now.

1266
01:23:38,040 --> 01:23:40,519
I've shown you what I can do.

1267
01:23:40,520 --> 01:23:44,439
I cut loose all those people,
all those little problems,

1268
01:23:44,440 --> 01:23:48,199
even 30 million quid, just
to get you to come out and play.

1269
01:23:48,200 --> 01:23:52,359
So take this as a friendly
warning... my dear.

1270
01:23:52,360 --> 01:23:55,080
Back off.

1271
01:23:56,760 --> 01:24:00,399
Although I have loved this,

1272
01:24:00,400 --> 01:24:02,319
this little game of ours.

1273
01:24:02,320 --> 01:24:07,959
Playing Jim from IT. Playing gay.
Did you like the little touch with the underwear?

1274
01:24:07,960 --> 01:24:10,760
People have died.
That's what people do!

1275
01:24:13,520 --> 01:24:16,599
I will stop you. No, you won't.

1276
01:24:16,600 --> 01:24:17,960
Are you all right?

1277
01:24:20,120 --> 01:24:22,119
You can talk, Johnny boy.

1278
01:24:22,120 --> 01:24:24,519
Go ahead.

1279
01:24:24,520 --> 01:24:28,240
Take it. Mm? Oh...

1280
01:24:29,360 --> 01:24:32,600
..that? The missile plans.

1281
01:24:36,960 --> 01:24:38,199
Boring!

1282
01:24:38,200 --> 01:24:41,239
I could have got them anywhere.

1283
01:24:41,240 --> 01:24:43,639
Sherlock, run!

1284
01:24:43,640 --> 01:24:46,159
HE LAUGHS Good!

1285
01:24:46,160 --> 01:24:49,439
Very good.

1286
01:24:49,440 --> 01:24:53,639
If your sniper pulls that trigger,
Mr Moriarty, then we both go up.

1287
01:24:53,640 --> 01:24:57,119
Isn't he sweet? I can see
why you like having him around.

1288
01:24:57,120 --> 01:25:00,039
But then, people do get
so sentimental about their pets.

1289
01:25:00,040 --> 01:25:01,959
They're so touchingly loyal.

1290
01:25:01,960 --> 01:25:03,200
But oops!

1291
01:25:04,440 --> 01:25:08,000
You've rather shown
your hand there, Dr Watson.

1292
01:25:12,440 --> 01:25:13,880
Gotcha.

1293
01:25:18,480 --> 01:25:24,079
Westwood. Do you know what happens if you
don't leave me alone, Sherlock? To you?

1294
01:25:24,080 --> 01:25:26,919
Oh, let me guess. I get killed.

1295
01:25:26,920 --> 01:25:28,439
Kill you?

1296
01:25:28,440 --> 01:25:32,839
No, don't be obvious.
I mean, I'm going to kill you anyway, some day.

1297
01:25:32,840 --> 01:25:34,719
I don't want to rush it, though.

1298
01:25:34,720 --> 01:25:36,919
I'm saving it up for
something special.

1299
01:25:36,920 --> 01:25:42,920
No, no, no, no, no.
If you don't stop prying, I'll burn you.

1300
01:25:45,480 --> 01:25:49,920
I'll burn the heart out of you.

1301
01:25:51,200 --> 01:25:54,679
I have been reliably informed
that I don't have one.

1302
01:25:54,680 --> 01:25:56,680
But we both know that's not
quite true.

1303
01:26:00,560 --> 01:26:03,959
Well, I'd better be off.

1304
01:26:03,960 --> 01:26:07,239
Well, so nice to have had a
proper chat.

1305
01:26:07,240 --> 01:26:09,079
What if I was to shoot you now?

1306
01:26:09,080 --> 01:26:11,399
Right now?

1307
01:26:11,400 --> 01:26:14,680
Then you could cherish
the look of surprise on my face.

1308
01:26:15,720 --> 01:26:17,479
Cos I'd be surprised, Sherlock.

1309
01:26:17,480 --> 01:26:19,199
Really, I would.

1310
01:26:19,200 --> 01:26:23,840
And just a teensy
bit...disappointed.

1311
01:26:26,320 --> 01:26:28,960
And of course, you wouldn't be able
to cherish it for very long.

1312
01:26:30,520 --> 01:26:34,000
Ciao, Sherlock Holmes.

1313
01:26:35,520 --> 01:26:40,280
Catch you...later.

1314
01:26:41,440 --> 01:26:44,240
No, you won't!
DOOR CLOSES

1315
01:26:49,680 --> 01:26:52,079
All right? Are you all right?

1316
01:26:52,080 --> 01:26:56,239
Yeah, I'm fine. I'm fine. Sherlock...

1317
01:26:56,240 --> 01:26:58,080
Sherlock!

1318
01:26:59,800 --> 01:27:01,440
HE GASPS

1319
01:27:04,840 --> 01:27:06,280
Oh, Christ.

1320
01:27:16,160 --> 01:27:20,280
Are you OK?
Me? Yeah, fine. I'm fine. Fine.

1321
01:27:22,720 --> 01:27:26,719
That, er...thing that you...
that you did,

1322
01:27:26,720 --> 01:27:32,240
that, um...you offered to do...
that was, um...good.

1323
01:27:33,720 --> 01:27:37,719
I'm glad no-one saw that. Mm?

1324
01:27:37,720 --> 01:27:40,799
You ripping my clothes off
in a darkened swimming pool.

1325
01:27:40,800 --> 01:27:41,880
People might talk.

1326
01:27:43,120 --> 01:27:45,720
They do little else.

1327
01:27:51,160 --> 01:27:55,799
Oh...
Sorry, boys. I'm so changeable!

1328
01:27:55,800 --> 01:27:58,559
It is a weakness with me,
but to be fair to myself,

1329
01:27:58,560 --> 01:28:00,359
it is my only weakness.

1330
01:28:00,360 --> 01:28:02,200
You can't be allowed to continue.

1331
01:28:04,200 --> 01:28:05,799
You just can't.

1332
01:28:05,800 --> 01:28:08,359
I would try to convince you,

1333
01:28:08,360 --> 01:28:12,240
but everything I have to say
has already crossed your mind.

1334
01:28:17,160 --> 01:28:19,480
Probably my answer has
crossed yours.
