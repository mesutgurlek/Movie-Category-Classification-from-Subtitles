00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:54,836
'My name is Charlie Wood...

2
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:00,989
'I think I made a big mistake.'

3
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:47,679
Higher...

4
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:51,509
I can't, sweetheart.
Any higher, you're gonna hit the moon.

5
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:53,471
And get a bump?

6
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,673
That's right, smart girl,
and get a bump!

7
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:16,794
Oh, hey! Emily, look who it is.

8
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:19,388
- Hi, Isabella.
- Hi, Emilita.

9
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:22,239
- There we go... Hi, how are you?
- Hey, great.

10
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:26,148
Ok, I've got her lunch,
an extra Thermos of apple juice,

11
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:29,670
her Elmo doll, Mr Frizzles,
12 grapes in a bag...

12
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:32,439
I got it, Mr Wood.

13
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:35,199
- Thanks. I'll see you at 5:00.
- OK.

14
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:38,676
All right, sweetheart. Come here.
High five...

15
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:05,677
First the Wyoming Widow,
now the Oregon Undertaker.

16
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:08,394
They just pulled a dead girl
out of the reservoir.

17
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:10,317
God! Suicide?

18
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:15,355
If she chopped off her own arms and
legs before strangling herself, maybe.

19
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:19,155
- Pen, I'm eating.
- They figure it's the Oregon Undertaker.

20
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:21,430
That's the fourth girl in six months.

21
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:23,835
Each one mutilated
and disembowelled...

22
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:27,316
- Pen! Pen!
- Oh, sorry baby.

23
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:32,712
Listen, Charlie. You don't
have to do this, you know.

24
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:35,400
Course I do. We can't go on
living on one income.

25
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:38,273
How many times have you
given Emily SpaghettiOs?

26
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,391
She likes SpaghettiOs.

27
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:44,398
Hey, baby. Trust me.
Once they buy your book...

28
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:48,354
Not a single publisher has called, Pen.
Not a single one.

29
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:52,792
'The term
"black hole" is of very recent origin.

30

by the American scientist John... '

corporations in the country.

33

- Sentel Online. Melanie speaking...
...Melanie speaking. How can I help?

34
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:28,795
Again, my name is Melanie.
Have a great day.

35
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:31,957
Do you only hire women
named Melanie?

36
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:36,710
It's a trick of the trade. Callers like
to think they get the same service rep.

37
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:39,957
This here is the Melanie
and John section,

38
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:43,197
and you are over here
with the Jennifers and Stephens.

39
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:45,550
This is you.

40
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:51,190
What do you mean this is me?
I was told I had a supervisor position.

41
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:56,110
You gotta spend six months
in the trenches

42
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:59,471
before you can interview
for a supervisor.

43
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,909
But I have a PhD.

44
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:05,589
- Surely...
- Look. You want the job or not?

45
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:09,635
- Yeah.
- Great!

46
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:11,796
Gus here will help get you started.

47
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:14,673
- OK, Stephen.
- It's Charlie.

48
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:16,791
Sure it is!

49
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:20,230
In the File menu do you see
where it says Open?

50
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:24,114
Okey-dokey. Can you open
the Open menu?

51
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:32,549
Okey-dokey. Again, my name is
Stephen. Thank you for calling Sentel.

52
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:35,148
'I actually liked Gus
at first sight.'

53
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:38,636
- Welcome to hell, dickhead!
- 'Maybe not at first.'

54
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:40,830
- I'm sorry?
- Hell!

55
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:43,394
People hooked up to machines
like slaves.

56
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:46,910
And the smell...
It's pure underarm.

57
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:51,511
OK, so what do we do here?

58
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:57,552
Sentel Online, Stephen speaking.
How may I help you?

59
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:01,552
Okey-dokey, ma'am. Have you
checked to see if your PC is on?

60
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:06,993
No, I'm not a retard.
That's simply the protocol...

61
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:08,838
Sorry.

62
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:13,310
Okey-dokey. I'm gonna check that
with my supervisor real quick

63
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:15,078
and I'm gonna put you on hold.

64
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:18,872
You feel feisty, you whiney
little turkey-necked bitch?

65
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:23,312
Why don't you hop up on my dick
and see if that fires your monitor?

66
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:26,877
Hello, ma'am. Thanks for waiting.

67
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,310
I'm gonna transfer you over to our
technical service department.

68
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:33,238
Okey-dokey? Please hold...

69
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:39,193
In the kingdom of the blind,
the one-eyed dwarf is king!

70
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:44,038
That's my wife, Stephanie.
Ex-wife! Keep forgetting!

71
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:47,835
And that there is my little daughter,
Thais.

72
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:51,589
- That's a pretty name.
- Yeah, it's Greek. It means 'Beloved'.

73
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:54,393
Thais has this problem
with her eye pressure

74
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:57,876
and the doctor said if she doesn't get
a cornea transplant in a year

75
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,594
then she's gonna go blind.

76
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:07,951
Every year, 65,000 diabetics

77
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:10,833
develop Proliferative Retinopathy,

78
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:13,190
one of the leading precursors
to blindness.

79
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:17,951
She's not diabetic.

80
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:23,310
Ahem! So, are you gonna be able
to afford the surgery before she...

81
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:29,037
Yeah, I hope so. If everything,
you know, goes as expected.

82
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:31,151
- What do you mean?
- Huh?

83
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:36,276
I have a plan.

84
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:40,038
Oh, hells bells!

85
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:47,552
'You see,
Stephen, I'm 65 years old now

86
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:51,468
'and my husband is asking me to do it
donkey-style... '

87
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:57,835
OK, ma'am. I'm going to transfer you to
our technical department. Please hold...

88
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:00,876
- Good god...
- Are you expecting a call?

89
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:07,868
Sentel Online, this is Charlie, er...
Stephen. How can I help you?

90
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,276
'Yeah, my IP Address is stuck on 169.'

91
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:16,474
OK, Sir. Have you checked
to make sure your computer is on?

92
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:19,319
- 'Didn't you hear what I said? '
- Yes.

93
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:22,989
Oh, IP Address. IP Address...

94
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:27,511
Here we go. Your IP Address
should start with 81.

95
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:30,108
So... does it?

96
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:34,950
'I told you it was stuck on 169!
Do the cleaners answer the phones?

97
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:37,275
- Sir...
- 'No, don't sir me, asshole!

98
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:40,278
'Just help me out
with my fucking problem! '

99
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:43,836
Please hold on while I check
with our technical department.

100
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:48,909
Yes, sir. Your wife is one
of 3.8 percent of American women

101
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:54,398
who engage in online chats with a
stranger, accompanied by masturbation.

102
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:59,630
'My wife died three months ago.

103
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:03,548
'But I'd like to discuss that
with your supervisor, Stephen.'

104
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:22,358
Hey! Charlie, wait. Wait!

105
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:25,631
- It's my fault.
- Don't worry about it. I'll be all right.

106
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:28,718
- Look, you know I said I had a plan?
- Yep.

107
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:31,991
Well, why don't you come in on it
with me?

108
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:34,998
You know, be like a partner
or something?

109
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:37,111
I sure as hell feel like I owe you one.

110
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:40,191
- It's not illegal, is it?
- What? No...

111
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:42,834
- Dickinson!
- Yeah. Right.

112
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:46,669
Look, meet me at the Monkey Wrench,
nine o'clock. OK? Yeah.

113
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:24,629
Choo-choo Charlie!

114
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:29,072
Hey, Max. Two bottles of your finest
mass-produced lager, if you please.

115
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:31,509
- So?
- Come here.

116
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:39,717
So, I stumbled across the database
at work.

117
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:43,037
The online history of each
and every member of Sentel Online.

118
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:46,197
Look, this is their record of everyone
in the state

119
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:50,916
that went online in the last three months
and logged on to an illegal porn site.

120
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:53,713
Now I figure there's gotta be
somebody in here

121
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:57,037
willing to fork over some coin
to keep things hush-hush.

122
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:04,469
- They all look the same
- And yet they're not.

123
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:11,632
- R-E-V Neville Smalls. What's R-E-V?
- Reverend.

124
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,309
Exactly! It's brilliant, don't you think?

125
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:23,309
- I don't think I'm criminal material...
- Wait, wait!

126
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:27,590
We're talking about a man of the cloth

127
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:30,154
who likes to watch teenagers
take off their clothes

128
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:33,078
and have god-knows-who
do god-knows-what to them!

129
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:34,792
Who's the real criminal here?

130
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:40,473
I tried to do things by the book, the
nine to five. You know where it got me?

131
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:43,797
My daughter is about to go blind,
Charlie. Blind!

132
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:50,789
- How much?
- 50 for me, 50 for you. Even hundred.

133
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:53,309
A hundred?

134
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:56,395
Thousand?

135
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:01,149
- Dollars?
- Not much to preserve one's reputation.

136
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:04,875
- What if somebody gets hurt?
- It's a non-violent enterprise.

137
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:09,755
No harm done whatsoever. Pretty
much all I need is for you to be my alibi.

138
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:12,678
- That's all?
- That's all.

139
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:14,994
OK...

140
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:25,834
Pick the blue one
and you go back to your old life.

141
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:29,555
But pick the red one
and you finally get to be a free man.

142
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:39,552
But, I must warn you, once you eat
the red one... there's no turning back.

143
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:50,590
Yes! I gotta tell you,
I was a little nervous about going solo.

144
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:54,759
OK. Rule number one -
preparation is king.

145
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:58,190
More than anything else,
we wanna rule out the element of...

146
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:00,276
- Surprise!
- Jeez!

147
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:02,391
Josie, how long were you sitting there?

148
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:06,069
Long enough to ask how you'd feel
about bringing in a third.

149
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:08,316
Oh...

150
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:11,750
'Here's the touching story
of how Gus met Josie.'

151
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:18,437
Er... miss.

152
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:23,634
- Yes, sir?
- I'm gonna get the cheque.

153
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:26,718
- Why?
- Does the chef have curly hair?

154
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:30,276
- No.
- I'm gonna get the cheque.

155
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:36,193
- You work at the call centre, huh?
- Yeah, how can you tell?

156
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:38,470
- Well, half the town does.
- Right.

157
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:42,036
- You have that look the rest of them do.
- What look is that?

158
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:47,188
That how much longer till I drop dead
so I don't have to go to my stupid job!

159
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:50,551
- That look.
- Yeah, that would be the one.

160
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:53,950
- You from here?
- Nope. Oklahoma.

161
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:59,313
- Oh, Oklahoma. What's that like?
- Nowhere near as sexy as you.

162
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:03,678
- Ahem!
- I'll get that.

163
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:11,149
So, care to hear about
our desert special?

164
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:17,513
Wow! Jeez! You sure are a very
forthright and smart girl, ain't ya?

165
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:21,918
That's what they said last year when
they crowned me Miss Teen Oklahoma.

166
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:24,508
- What?
- What?

167
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:28,599
- Miss Teen Oklahoma? Last year?
- Yeah.

168
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:32,872
- How old are you?
- 18... more or less.

169
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,833
Is it more or is it less?

170
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:38,155
Well... less, I guess!

171
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:41,831
Shit!

172
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:45,236
- What the hell's matter with you?
- You're a child!

173
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:49,069
Do I look like a child? Huh?

174
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:52,510
OK... Ah! Is there anything else
you forgot to mention?

175
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:05,152
- Who are you?
- Charlie Wood, Gus's former co-worker.

176
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:07,874
Josie McBroom.
Gus and I were an item.

177
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,592
- Ha!
- What?

178
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:13,076
- I'm sorry to interrupt, but what...
- I want in.

179
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:19,393
All right, read my lips, OK -
no f... g way!

180
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:21,795
- You guys can't do the job without me?
- Why?

181
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:24,878
Because, dumb-dumb, I'm the only one
who can make the call.

182
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:28,151
If the preacher records you
on his answer machine

183
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:32,319
they'll try and match it up with
the voice records from the call centre.

184
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:36,238
You guy's would be screwed,
stuffed and mounted.

185
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:38,590
- Is that true?
- Kinda.

186
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:40,790
How'd you work that out?

187
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:43,639
I told you, I was Miss Teen Oklahoma.

188
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:47,717
- How much do you want?
- 20,000.

189
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:51,549
20,000? For making a phone call?

190
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:54,513
For making 'the' phone call.

191
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:04,558
'The average person makes
about 1,140 phone calls each year,

192
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:07,672
'none of which go anything like this.'

193
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:10,633
May I speak to the Reverend Smalls,
please?

194
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:19,998
Hi, Reverend. Are you familiar
with a website that goes by the name of

195
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:24,910
teen orgies dot com,
or young and hung dot com?

196
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:30,189
Someone who knows what the mouse
plays when the wife's away.

197
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:36,278
Listen, sicko. I have a list of all your
favourite sites, your credit card number,

198
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:40,439
dates and times of all your connections,
so you better cut the crap!

199
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:47,871
- What do I want?
- 100,000 dollars.

200
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:52,635
100,000 dollars.

201
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:55,716
- 200,000.
- What?

202
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:59,310
You heard me,
I want 200,000 dollars, cash.

203
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:04,109
Take it or leave it. But if I don't have
my money by tomorrow evening,

204
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:06,800
the next church newsletter
is gonna be a doozy!

205
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:14,431
And I'll be sending somebody.

206
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:19,513
Well, I think that somebody deserves
to made a full partner, don't you?

207
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:22,916
Wait! I took a chance and it worked.

208
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:25,395
Now we each get 70,000 dollars.

209
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:29,798
It's actually 66,666,
followed by an infinite number of sixes.

210
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:31,512
Thanks, Rain Man!

211
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:36,509
From now on, anybody pulls
any out-of-the-blue stunts, she's out!

212
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:39,234
If we're partners,
let's start acting like it.

213
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:43,638
This is the plan - I go get the money
at 9:00pm tomorrow.

214
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:46,399
'At the same time,
Charlie enters the Monkey Wrench

215
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:49,273
'and pretends we ran
out of gas on the road to Mill Creek.'

216
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:52,119
He also says that I'm on my way
to the gas station,

217
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:54,196
the one that opens 24/7, don't forget.

218
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:57,756
10:00pm, after I stash the money
in a locker at the railway station,

219
00:17:57,880 --> 00:18:01,077
I come back and tell everyone
about my walk in the dark.

220
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:04,510
If it comes up, Charlie was at the bar,
I was at the gas station.

221
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:06,949
The guy at the station
will say he never saw you.

222
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:11,039
- Sure. You why? Cos he's blind.
- Oh, pretty brill!

223
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:13,276
The following day we meet at noon,

224
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:15,834
we divvy up the money
and go our respective ways.

225
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:18,428
OK, now. Any questions?

226
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:21,313
Why don't we just divvy up
the money immediately?

227
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:24,318
Rule number two -
always let the dust settle after a job.

228
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:28,479
"Rule number two?" What, you've been
reading 'Blackmailing for Dummies'?

229
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:31,471
Any questions? Great.

230
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:35,991
Rule number three - no matter what
happens... always stick to the plan.

231
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:49,309
'The next day might have been
the longest one I'd ever known.

232
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:55,037
'For the first time
since I could remember

233
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:58,311
'I'd be able to bring security
and happiness to my family.'

234
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:11,357
'I couldn't tell you
if what I felt was fear or excitement.'

235
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:17,234
So, Mr Supervisor, talk to me.
Do you have a secretary?

236
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:19,476
- Yep.
- Is she pretty?

237
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:24,390
Pretty?
Er... no, she's more nondescript.

238
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:26,511
What's her name?

239
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:28,676
- Sharon.
- Sharon?

240
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:32,270
- Sharon what?
- Er... Stone.

241
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:35,516
- Sharon Stone?
- I know!

242
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:37,756
- So, how was your day?
- Oh, phenomenal

243
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:40,440
And to top it off,
the FBI is sending in The Eye.

244
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:42,551
- The what?
- The who?

245
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:46,639
Bionic, supersonic Special Agent
Chester Hymes, FBI. AKA The Eye.

246
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:50,275
Which is just what I need
with the Undertaker case out of control -

247
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:53,472
no leads, no fingerprints, nothing.

248
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:57,673
Honestly, why some folks suddenly
have to turn into criminals is beyond me.

249
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:04,479
- What if I did?
- What if you did what?

250
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:08,270
If I became a criminal.

251
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:12,632
Like if I, er... stole some money,
or something.

252
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:14,910
I'd arrest you.

253
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:26,351
But let's say...
let's say I had to.

254
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:32,191
Like we had no other choice
and I had to steal something, er...

255
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:34,914
because I had to. What then?

256
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:36,792
I'd arrest you.

257
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:40,952
- Why?
- A good cop always gets her man!

258
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:43,071
No... l'm serious, Pen.

259
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:44,872
Why...

260
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,719
Why should Emily have to put up
with second-hand toys,

261
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:50,070
second-hand clothes,
a second-hand life?

262
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:58,310
Charlie, you have your book, you have
me and Emily. And that makes us rich.

263
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:35,110
Hi.

264
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:38,152
Oh, what a crazy night!

265
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:40,840
- My car ran out of gas...
- You gonna order?

266
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:42,951
Sure. Beer, please.

267
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:45,913
One of your finest, mass-produced...

268
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:59,072
My friend, Gus... You know Gus.

269
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:02,033
Gus Dickinson, works down
at the call centre.

270
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:04,151
Reverend Smalls?

271
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:11,755
And that's where he is now -
walking down that road to the station.

272
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:14,792
Reverend Sma...

273
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:16,717
Smalls...

274
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:21,595
The old blind guy who runs the station
keeps it open 24/7.

275
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:25,395
Old blind guy is celebrating his 80th
birthday tonight, young fella.

276
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:30,397
Who the hell are you?

277
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:36,269
Er... l'm the guy that's here
to collect the money.

278
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:50,877
- Give me your gun.
- I don't have one.

279
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:56,630
You've come to get money from me
and you ain't packing?

280
00:22:56,760 --> 00:22:58,830
Give my regards
to the big bearded guy.

281
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:02,316
You don't mean Santa Claus, do you?

282
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:14,471
Gus?

283
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:17,311
Gus?

284
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:31,551
Gus?

285
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:35,431
Gus?

286
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:51,511
Oh my...!

287
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:17,591
'lf it's you, Jose, fuck
off! Everybody else, leave a message.'

288
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:21,508
Josie? Josie? Pick up.

289
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:27,876
Josie, are you there?
We have a real problem here. Pick up.

290
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:44,671
Gus?

291
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:58,871
Gus?

292
00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:03,753
Gus? Gus, are you there?

293
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:08,111
Gus?

294
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:15,751
Gus?

295
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:19,357
- Oh!
- Oh my God!

296
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:22,119
- What happened?
- What are you doing here?

297
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:24,800
The station was closed.

298
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:26,956
Our alibi! So I came here.

299
00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:29,514
- Whoa! Calm down
- What the hell happened?

300
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:32,279
The bastard pulled a gun on me.
He was gonna shoot me

301
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:35,039
and I grabbed the gun and it went off.
No biggy.

302
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:38,914
- No biggy?
- I conked him on the head with a vase.

303
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:41,076
He's gonna wake up any minute now.

304
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:47,514
Oh, Gus...

305
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:52,550
I think I made a big mistake.

306
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:58,235
- Did you call the cops?
- I put him in the septic tank.

307
00:26:58,360 --> 00:27:00,316
- Who?
- The corpse.

308
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:03,432
- What corpse?
- The reverend's corpse.

309
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:07,589
The reverend wasn't a corpse
when I left him.

310
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:10,757
- There was blood. I saw blood...
- It was my blood.

311
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:14,270
He shot me through the leg.
Look, it went clean through the muscle.

312
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:17,277
Oh my god.

313
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:20,951
Why didn't you answer
when I called you?

314
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:23,833
I was in the bathroom
cleaning the wound.

315
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:30,189
I checked his pulse. I mean, well...

316
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:33,118
- Maybe I missed it. 17 percent...
- You missed it?

317
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:35,629
What? Can't we get him
out of the tank?

318
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:39,196
- How long's he been down there?
- 10 minutes, tops.

319
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:41,390
What?

320
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:45,354
I thought I said, no matter what,
stick to the fucking plan.

321
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:47,675
There wasn't anything
in the fucking plan

322
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:51,270
about the blind guy's birthday
and the reverend in a pool of blood!

323
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:53,277
All right, let's calm down.

324
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:55,197
- Don't you need a doctor?
- Yeah!

325
00:27:55,320 --> 00:27:57,390
There's a slightly more
pressing matter!

326
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:29,312
- What are you doing?
- He's crying.

327
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:34,150
Jesus, Gus. He's crying
for what we've done, for our sin.

328
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:38,909
- Jesus. Hail Mary, full of grace...
- Bathtub.

329
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:46,438
Goddammit! Is that part of your plan?

330
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:48,915
After you kill someone
you take a nice hot bath?

331
00:28:49,040 --> 00:28:54,034
I didn't kill anybody, first of all.
Second, I don't pray to leaky ceilings!

332
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:57,630
Well you know what,
I'm having a tough time here.

333
00:28:57,760 --> 00:29:02,276
I just drowned a man of the cloth
in crap!

334
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:04,675
- Maybe I should turn myself in...
- No!

335
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:06,791
Nobody is turning anybody in

336
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:10,515
Now did you know the priest was alive
when you killed him?

337
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:13,154
- No.
- There you go then.

338
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:22,117
How could we have thought a reverend
would have 200,000 dollars in cash?

339
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:27,152
The average savings of an
American couple between 35 and 50

340
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:29,510
is 15,256 dollars.

341
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:31,870
Charlie, Charlie...

342
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,560
Shut up!

343
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:38,719
Wait!

344
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:41,593
No! Rule number four -
never return to the crime scene.

345
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:43,790
It's Josie's card, I left it by the phone.

346
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:48,395
Rule number five - if your partner
is an idiot, forget rule number four.

347
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:57,191
It's gone.

348
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:08,392
Got it.

349
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:10,715
Ow! What the fuck?

350
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:14,712
Ow!

351
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,150
Shouldn't we be going?

352
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:26,999
Aren't you just a little curious?

353
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:35,477
'Have a look right there.
This beauty, huh?

354
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:38,672
'How are you? '

355
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:41,997
'Look. This is for you, all right? '

356
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:45,396
- She's an actress, right?
- 'Shut up, all right?

357
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:48,398
'You like this, baby?
You like this? Right here?

358
00:30:48,520 --> 00:30:50,715
'You like to feel that? Feel that. Yeah.

359
00:30:50,840 --> 00:30:55,038
'Yeah. You know what this?
I am gonna carve your face up...

360
00:30:55,160 --> 00:30:57,151
'Argh! '

361
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:59,077
'Shut up! '

362
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:03,239
If I didn't know better, you know
what I'd say this looks like?

363
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:08,519
A snuff film?

364
00:31:13,560 --> 00:31:15,312
Holy moly!

365
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:19,228
- Who says Holy moly?
- Is it important right now?

366
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:23,592
This is why he was so keen to cop
a deal. He's part of a snuff film ring.

367
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:26,871
- We've gotta call the police.
- What are we gonna tell them?

368
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:30,549
- Look, if they find the body...
- They're not gonna find the body.

369
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:33,035
The septic tank was genius.
Look at it this way -

370
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:35,390
we may have saved lives tonight.

371
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:39,830
- You think he's the Oregon Undertaker?
- Who knows.

372
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:42,030
He sure as hell got what he deserved.

373
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:45,478
Charlie... Wait!

374
00:31:48,520 --> 00:31:50,636
You mind if I come in?

375
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:55,396
What?

376
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:58,630
We found the reverend's body.

377
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:03,069
- It was an accident...
- This was no accident.

378
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:06,476
Someone shot him three times
in the head

379
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:09,319
and left him in his car
by the side of the road.

380
00:32:11,160 --> 00:32:15,517
That's a hard pill to swallow.
Murder always is.

381
00:32:17,040 --> 00:32:20,715
I'm sorry. Are you certain
that it's the Reverend Smalls?

382
00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:23,274
- Oh yeah. We've got a positive ID.
- Then who's...

383
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:26,469
Who's what?

384
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:29,956
Who is... safe

385
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:32,116
in this godforsaken world...

386
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:34,595
- You family?
- Yeah... No!

387
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:38,429
Just a friend. A family friend.

388
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:40,676
- And your name is?
- Stephen.

389
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:44,797
Stephen Hawking.

390
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:47,309
Mind if I...

391
00:33:03,160 --> 00:33:07,119
- You're watching a DVD, huh?
- Yeah... No!

392
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:10,312
I mean... did you know that DVD sales

393
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:15,309
have risen by 226 percent
over the last six months?

394
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:18,034
Well... no.

395
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:22,669
But I sure am 100 percent glad
to know that. Thanks for the factoid.

396
00:33:27,560 --> 00:33:31,348
So, er... can I get you a drink?

397
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:33,755
A glass of H20, if you please,
Mr Hawking.

398
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:44,871
There's some blood on the floor.

399
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:55,631
- Mr Hawking?
- Yeah. I, er...

400
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:58,194
I broke a vase and, er...

401
00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:01,869
and accidentally cut my arm
on one of the shards.

402
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:12,957
- Look...
- Oh, doggy!

403
00:34:13,080 --> 00:34:15,071
That hurts just looking at it.

404
00:34:16,160 --> 00:34:19,470
- What are you doing?
- Getting a sample. Standard procedure.

405
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:23,149
'Deputy Garmen, Detective
Wood wants you at the station.'

406
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:25,077
Copy that.

407
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:28,431
Detective Wood, always breathing
down my neck.

408
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:31,154
Ain't had a good poke, if you ask me.

409
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:36,108
I'm not asking, but whatever.

410
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:37,912
Well, I'd better get a move on.

411
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:45,676
Mmm... What a beautiful night.

412
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:49,678
You could almost
touch those stars, huh?

413
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:51,950
Yep.

414
00:34:52,080 --> 00:34:55,072
Although, even if you were travelling
the speed of light

415
00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:58,192
it would take you 1,460 days
to reach the closest one.

416
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:00,117
Is that right?

417
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:03,118
Well you are just a walking
factoid factory, partner!

418
00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:06,232
You have yourself
a good night.

419
00:35:06,360 --> 00:35:08,157
You, too, officer.

420
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:15,479
Oh... would you mind if I took a gander
at that DVD you were watching?

421
00:35:18,040 --> 00:35:20,270
Curiosity killed the cat, Officer.

422
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:23,517
In my line of work, the cat gets a raise
and a promotion.

423
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:38,753
My nine-year-old loves this one.

424
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:41,394
Especially this part
with this singing cow.

425
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:46,196
I've got to admit, Stephen...

426
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:48,311
I thought you were hiding something.

427
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:09,478
It kinda looks like
something got dragged here.

428
00:36:12,080 --> 00:36:14,071
You wanna come with me?

429
00:36:18,520 --> 00:36:20,954
I need you to lift this up for me,
Stephen.

430
00:36:21,080 --> 00:36:23,878
- Officer, you don't want to smell...
- Open it.

431
00:36:31,640 --> 00:36:34,154
So much for the raise
and the promotion, Officer!

432
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:37,714
There we go.

433
00:36:37,840 --> 00:36:41,674
I knew Columbo here would come back
for the DVD. What do we do with him?

434
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:44,951
- Who is in the septic tank?
- How do I know.

435
00:36:45,080 --> 00:36:47,116
Check the papers, see who's missing.

436
00:36:47,240 --> 00:36:49,993
And then what, Gus?
We killed somebody!

437
00:36:50,120 --> 00:36:54,113
- Oh, you killed somebody!
- Well, you kidnapped a cop!

438
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:59,155
- Oh, yes, I did! What do you propose?
- I'm turning myself in.

439
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:01,396
They'll say murdered
the real reverend.

440
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:04,796
- I had nothing to do with that!
- So? What do they care?

441
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:08,071
Makes it all nice and neat for them.
No messy loose ends.

442
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:12,079
I'd bet good money they'll be all, "Gosh!
We finally caught the Undertaker!"

443
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:14,589
You'll be spitting fire and crying sparks.

444
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:17,188
Enough, OK? Let's not
make this worse than it is.

445
00:37:17,320 --> 00:37:19,709
Charlie, how could this be any worse?

446
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:23,829
You're not going anywhere.

447
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:25,757
You're gonna shoot me?

448
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:29,077
I've got a family too, Charlie.
I am not going to jail.

449
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:32,714
I am going to shoot you, Charlie!

450
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:36,599
- No, you're not.
- Yes, I am.

451
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:42,354
- No, you're not.
- Yes, I am!

452
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:47,191
Shit!

453
00:37:56,680 --> 00:37:58,671
Ah! I knew you would...

454
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:02,271
I wouldn't do that.

455
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:11,197
Who the hell are you?

456
00:38:11,320 --> 00:38:16,075
Considering that I live here, young man,
the question is, "Who the hell are you?"

457
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:21,114
It's not what you think, Mrs Smalls.
We're not burglars.

458
00:38:21,240 --> 00:38:24,118
Look... we have some terrible news.

459
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:27,710
Your husband, the reverend...

460
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:29,831
has passed on.

461
00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:32,679
Considering I put three bullets
in his head

462
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:35,439
I should certainly hope so!

463
00:38:35,560 --> 00:38:38,552
Mrs Smalls, you have the right
to remain silent.

464
00:38:38,680 --> 00:38:40,750
- Anything you say...
- Oh, please!

465
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:42,871
So you killed him?

466
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:46,197
I spent years turning a blind eye
to that pervert's, er...

467
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:48,709
shall we say filmmaking aspirations.

468
00:38:48,840 --> 00:38:51,354
Max and I felt we deserved
a share of his benefits.

469
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:55,717
- Who's Max?
- A real man.

470
00:38:56,720 --> 00:39:01,077
We're going from here to somewhere
where we'll never worry ever again.

471
00:39:02,680 --> 00:39:05,148
- Er... Ahem!
- What?

472
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:07,953
I think he may already be there.

473
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:13,637
- What? He wouldn't leave without me.
- He didn't really have a choice.

474
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:15,955
- It was an accident.
- OK!

475
00:39:16,080 --> 00:39:18,799
- Shut up...
- Why don't you both shut up!

476
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:23,793
All right, where's the money?

477
00:39:24,920 --> 00:39:29,038
- Sorry, what money?
- Two million dollars doesn't just vanish!

478
00:39:29,160 --> 00:39:31,071
- Two...
- Yeah, where is it?

479
00:39:33,560 --> 00:39:35,437
Oh dear!

480
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:39,357
I guess I'll just have to count to three.
One...

481
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:41,471
- No, Mrs Smalls!
- Tell her where it is.

482
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:43,033
- We don't know!
- Two...

483
00:39:43,160 --> 00:39:45,879
Tell her!

484
00:39:58,360 --> 00:40:02,353
We'll, I'll be!
I haven't heard Pink Floyd in years.

485
00:40:11,640 --> 00:40:14,279
Well, pa, time to fire up
the old septic tank!

486
00:40:17,640 --> 00:40:21,952
By the way, what happened exactly?

487
00:40:23,080 --> 00:40:26,390
Sure. Charlie drowned the reverend,
who he thought was dead

488
00:40:26,520 --> 00:40:28,670
even though he wasn't,
in the septic tank.

489
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:30,791
Turns out he wasn't the real reverend.

490
00:40:30,920 --> 00:40:33,115
The real reverend was murdered
by his wife,

491
00:40:33,240 --> 00:40:36,312
the woman whose head you split
with an axe - stellar timing!

492
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:41,309
She planned to run away with her lover,
Max, now deceased, thanks to Charlie,

493
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:45,319
and the two million dollars the reverend
raised from his side venture

494
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:48,876
in shooting and selling snuff films.
Okey-dokey?

495
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:52,549
- Groovy!
- Groovy?

496
00:40:52,680 --> 00:40:55,433
Three people died tonight, Josie.

497
00:40:55,560 --> 00:40:59,109
In this business, unfortunately,
death is an occupational hazard.

498
00:40:59,240 --> 00:41:04,075
And by the way, way to go using
my name in front of the cop... Charlie!

499
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:06,760
Hey, look. I can help.

500
00:41:07,960 --> 00:41:11,509
I'll testify that I heard Mrs Smalls
confess to killing her husband.

501
00:41:11,640 --> 00:41:15,599
As for Mrs Smalls, she was
threatening the life of a police officer.

502
00:41:17,120 --> 00:41:20,908
- What about the guy in the tank?
- You killed him by accident.

503
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:24,237
You wouldn't do much time.
Five years, tops.

504
00:41:24,360 --> 00:41:26,351
Oh my God!

505
00:41:34,120 --> 00:41:36,111
Well that doesn't suck!

506
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:41,035
I have to hand it to you.
That was a brilliant plan after all.

507
00:41:41,160 --> 00:41:44,118
Can you believe it? We're rich.

508
00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:46,993
You guys can keep my share.
I'm gonna turn myself in.

509
00:41:47,120 --> 00:41:49,190
If I go to jail, I go to jail.

510
00:41:49,320 --> 00:41:51,550
Don't be ridiculous! You earned this.

511
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:53,636
They'll just hunt us down like animals.

512
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:56,593
With this kind of money
you can disappear.

513
00:41:56,720 --> 00:41:59,473
I have a wife and daughter,
I don't want to disappear.

514
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:01,556
Fine. Gus and I will leave the state

515
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:04,990
and we'll just drop you and the deputy
in the middle of nowhere.

516
00:42:05,120 --> 00:42:07,554
- How's that sound?
- Let's get rid of the deputy.

517
00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:09,238
- What?
- Good thinking!

518
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:12,989
Since he's the only one who can testify
that we're innocent of the murder.

519
00:42:13,120 --> 00:42:14,951
OK, Miss Teen Oklahoma...

520
00:42:15,080 --> 00:42:17,275
Help!

521
00:42:17,840 --> 00:42:19,592
Help!

522
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:47,036
- Hold his head.
- What are you doing?

523
00:42:47,160 --> 00:42:49,515
Just helping him relax a little.

524
00:43:02,080 --> 00:43:04,594
My friend here decided to surrender.

525
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:07,154
We'll drop you both somewhere
and say goodbye.

526
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:11,193
- You're making a big mistake.
- Let's get out of here.

527
00:43:12,840 --> 00:43:14,831
Wait, wait!

528
00:43:15,880 --> 00:43:18,189
- I gotta go pee.
- Oh...

529
00:43:18,320 --> 00:43:21,551
- Please?
- OK.

530
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:25,876
Wait...

531
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:28,753
- The handcuffs.
- In your dreams!

532
00:43:28,880 --> 00:43:31,678
There are certain requirements...

533
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:43,870
There. Enjoy!

534
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:05,155
I'm sorry...

535
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:07,475
I can't go if you're, er... watching.

536
00:44:07,600 --> 00:44:09,830
Could you just close...

537
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:14,877
Stage fright!
It happens to the best of us.

538
00:44:35,600 --> 00:44:37,591
One minute warning.

539
00:44:44,360 --> 00:44:46,635
You dropped this.

540
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:52,591
- No, I can explain... Argh!
- Get up, partner!

541
00:44:52,720 --> 00:44:56,235
- What the hell's the matter with you?
- It's a flight to Vegas.

542
00:44:56,360 --> 00:44:59,591
8:00am. We were supposed
to meet at noon to split the money.

543
00:44:59,720 --> 00:45:03,508
- That asshole broke my nose!
- You better have an explanation.

544
00:45:03,640 --> 00:45:08,919
All right, I lied about Thais needing
a cornea transplant. She's fine.

545
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:13,949
- I owe my wife 300,000 bucks.
- I'm sorry?

546
00:45:14,080 --> 00:45:17,834
I owe my ex-wife 300,000 dollars
and because of her snake of a lawyer

547
00:45:17,960 --> 00:45:20,713
there is a restraining order against me
until I pay up.

548
00:45:20,840 --> 00:45:23,479
I have not seen or talked
to my daughter in two years.

549
00:45:23,600 --> 00:45:25,511
- Why not say?
- Would you have helped?

550
00:45:25,640 --> 00:45:27,915
- Of course not.
- Well, there you go, then!

551
00:45:37,640 --> 00:45:40,200
- Oh my God!
- There goes our alibi.

552
00:45:40,320 --> 00:45:43,278
Uh-uh! Freakin' fantastic!

553
00:45:43,400 --> 00:45:46,915
Don't you see? None of us
has to run away or turn ourselves in.

554
00:45:47,040 --> 00:45:49,600
What do you propose?
We roam the country

555
00:45:49,720 --> 00:45:51,711
like Bonnie and Clyde... and Clyde?

556
00:45:51,840 --> 00:45:56,595
No. First, we take the cop's car
and crash it into a tree up the road.

557
00:45:56,720 --> 00:45:59,280
We put him and the reverend's wife
in her car

558
00:45:59,400 --> 00:46:01,675
and push it over the cliff
at Grouse Point.

559
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:06,078
- They'd find the car in a couple of days.
- And what would the forensic figure?

560
00:46:06,200 --> 00:46:10,034
That the deputy was driving under
the influence of alcohol, crashed,

561
00:46:10,160 --> 00:46:12,628
flagged down another car
driven by Mrs Smalls,

562
00:46:12,760 --> 00:46:15,433
took control of the wheel
and drove them off a cliff.

563
00:46:15,560 --> 00:46:19,189
And the wounds, they'd be more
than covered up by the crash.

564
00:46:19,320 --> 00:46:21,834
So the reverend gets murdered
on the same night

565
00:46:21,960 --> 00:46:24,952
that his wife gets driven off a cliff
by a drunken cop?

566
00:46:25,080 --> 00:46:27,196
That doesn't sound very accidental.

567
00:46:27,320 --> 00:46:29,629
You know, he has a point... for once.

568
00:46:29,760 --> 00:46:34,550
OK, er... Then we plant Mrs Smalls'
gun in the car with them.

569
00:46:34,680 --> 00:46:37,433
They figure it was the weapon
that killed the reverend.

570
00:46:37,560 --> 00:46:40,279
They think... maybe she had an affair
with the deputy,

571
00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:45,190
maybe they decide to off the reverend
and then maybe they had an accident.

572
00:46:46,120 --> 00:46:49,749
- That's a hell of a lot of maybes!
- Let's hear your bright idea, boss.

573
00:46:57,800 --> 00:47:00,758
Ooh! Old broad sure liked her food!

574
00:47:00,880 --> 00:47:03,599
Fancy body bags!

575
00:47:06,280 --> 00:47:09,716
- You're eating a lollypop?
- I didn't have dinner. I need the sugar.

576
00:47:11,440 --> 00:47:13,590
- Ow!
- Are you OK?

577
00:47:13,720 --> 00:47:16,439
Yeah. Let's just get this done.

578
00:48:21,120 --> 00:48:23,236
Can you go any slower?

579
00:48:23,360 --> 00:48:26,557
We don't wanna attract attention,
now do we?

580
00:48:26,680 --> 00:48:29,274
No, we don't wanna go back in time,
now do we?

581
00:48:30,280 --> 00:48:34,671
It's only by going faster than light that
one could theoretically go back in time.

582
00:48:34,800 --> 00:48:37,712
Yeah! Do me a favour -
shut the fuck up!

583
00:48:39,760 --> 00:48:43,992
You have some serious stress-related
issues. You're not Canadian, are you?

584
00:48:44,120 --> 00:48:46,156
Wh... What?

585
00:48:46,280 --> 00:48:50,831
The 2003 statistical report on the health
of Canadians states that 62 percent...

586
00:48:50,960 --> 00:48:56,159
What's wrong with you? You pull these
random facts and stats out of your ass,

587
00:48:56,280 --> 00:48:58,714
and nobody really gives a shit!

588
00:48:58,840 --> 00:49:01,308
- Guys!
- Jesus Christ, man!

589
00:49:01,440 --> 00:49:03,590
Charlie, here's a nifty stat for you -

590
00:49:03,720 --> 00:49:07,156
for a guy that knows everything,
to get a job in a call centre

591
00:49:07,280 --> 00:49:11,034
you have to be, bar none, the biggest
loser I have ever met in my life.

592
00:49:11,160 --> 00:49:13,151
And I'm from Las Vegas!

593
00:49:26,200 --> 00:49:29,795
You ever hear of a neurotransmitter
called acetylcholine?

594
00:49:29,920 --> 00:49:31,512
What?

595
00:49:31,640 --> 00:49:35,428
It's the chemical your brain uses
for memory... dummy.

596
00:49:36,440 --> 00:49:38,556
- Is it?
- Yeah, that's exactly right.

597
00:49:38,680 --> 00:49:43,151
See, the reason I lost my teaching job
is I have this disorder,

598
00:49:43,280 --> 00:49:46,511
typified by a gradual, acute
neuro-degeneration

599
00:49:46,640 --> 00:49:48,631
of the cerebral cortex.

600
00:49:48,760 --> 00:49:53,675
Or if that's too "pulled out of my ass"
for you, I'm slowly losing my memory.

601
00:49:55,240 --> 00:49:56,832
Are you making this up?

602
00:49:56,960 --> 00:50:00,839
The doctors think that, in a year or two,
my mind will be a total blank.

603
00:50:00,960 --> 00:50:03,428
So the only thing I can do
to slow things down

604
00:50:03,560 --> 00:50:06,677
is to keep working my memory
as much as possible.

605
00:50:07,840 --> 00:50:09,990
Do you remember
what's in the blue bag?

606
00:50:10,120 --> 00:50:12,793
What blue bag?

607
00:50:14,280 --> 00:50:17,590
Jeez, guy, I'm really sorry.
You know...

608
00:50:26,040 --> 00:50:29,032
Hey, Gus, what's the Greek word
for bullshit?

609
00:50:35,160 --> 00:50:37,151
- You sonofabitch!
- Stop it!

610
00:50:37,280 --> 00:50:39,236
Damn it! What the...

611
00:50:43,360 --> 00:50:46,397
- Are you fucking crazy?
- He lied to us again!

612
00:50:46,520 --> 00:50:48,988
He doesn't have a daughter...

613
00:50:49,120 --> 00:50:51,873
Is everyone OK in there?

614
00:50:54,520 --> 00:50:56,556
We're fine.

615
00:50:56,680 --> 00:50:59,956
Everything's fine.
So, thanks for coming over.

616
00:51:00,080 --> 00:51:02,674
- I think we should call the police.
- What?

617
00:51:02,800 --> 00:51:05,758
No, let's not bother them.
They've got a lot on their plate.

618
00:51:05,880 --> 00:51:07,871
You're fine, your car's fine.

619
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:11,595
Yeah, but I'm pretty sure
that's standard procedure, isn't it?

620
00:51:12,880 --> 00:51:16,589
I'll be honest with you - I don't give
a rat's ass for standard procedure.

621
00:51:16,720 --> 00:51:20,508
Here, why don't you pack your fat ass
back in your car

622
00:51:20,640 --> 00:51:23,598
and buy yourself as big a sandwich
as your heart desires.

623
00:51:23,720 --> 00:51:26,598
Is that standard enough
procedure for you?

624
00:51:26,720 --> 00:51:28,870
- Your trunk is open.
- What?

625
00:51:30,680 --> 00:51:32,875
You all going on a trip somewhere?

626
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:36,993
Sure looks you're packed for a long one.
Is that your entire wardrobe in there?

627
00:51:37,120 --> 00:51:39,350
No, it's a couple of dead bodies.

628
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:46,673
- That was a good one!
- I'm glad you liked it...

629
00:51:46,800 --> 00:51:49,234
Oh, jeez!

630
00:51:49,360 --> 00:51:52,909
Oh, it's time for old stingy!

631
00:51:53,040 --> 00:51:54,871
What?

632
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:57,070
Oh, it's insulin.

633
00:51:57,200 --> 00:51:59,191
Whatever!

634
00:52:06,640 --> 00:52:08,915
Freak show!

635
00:52:10,880 --> 00:52:12,757
- Ow!
- You sonofabitch!

636
00:52:12,880 --> 00:52:16,236
Granted, I lied, but I have
a responsibility towards myself.

637
00:52:16,360 --> 00:52:19,511
- When I got out of prison, I swore...
- What? What?

638
00:52:19,640 --> 00:52:22,438
You were in prison? For what?

639
00:52:22,560 --> 00:52:26,394
I kind of convinced some people
to invest in some businesses

640
00:52:26,520 --> 00:52:29,353
that weren't actually,
technically in existence.

641
00:52:29,480 --> 00:52:32,233
- Anything else you forgot, sociopath?
- Oh, come on!

642
00:52:32,360 --> 00:52:35,272
- Aren't you overreacting a bit?
- Overreacting?

643
00:52:35,400 --> 00:52:37,834
I happen to be a very good conman.

644
00:52:37,960 --> 00:52:40,997
That's my talent. What do you want
me to do, waste it?

645
00:52:41,120 --> 00:52:44,157
You don't go around using it
on your partners, jerk!

646
00:52:45,080 --> 00:52:48,629
I bet Gus isn't even your real name.
What is it?

647
00:52:48,760 --> 00:52:52,196
- No, really, I'd love to know.
- My mother, God rest her soul...

648
00:52:52,320 --> 00:52:55,118
...named me after Augustus...

649
00:53:28,520 --> 00:53:30,511
What the...

650
00:53:36,240 --> 00:53:40,916
- Maybe she's jumped out the trunk.
- She didn't jump out of any trunk.

651
00:53:41,040 --> 00:53:43,395
- She's fucking dead.
- Did you check her pulse?

652
00:53:43,520 --> 00:53:46,592
- Er... no.
- Why didn't you check her pulse?

653
00:53:46,720 --> 00:53:50,315
Because I assume that when you
have an axe lodged in your skull

654
00:53:50,440 --> 00:53:52,431
your pulse tends to bottom out on you!

655
00:53:52,560 --> 00:53:56,439
- Maybe you shouldn't assume so much.
- All right, just settle down, kids!

656
00:53:56,560 --> 00:54:00,075
All that matters now is that we find her
before someone else does.

657
00:54:00,200 --> 00:54:04,034
- Try to keep it on the road this time!
- Hey, fuck you! Fuck you both!

658
00:54:04,160 --> 00:54:10,076
When people ain't punching me
in the eye, my driving is just perfect.

659
00:54:10,200 --> 00:54:11,838
Argh!

660
00:54:33,560 --> 00:54:36,438
Want me to check her pulse?

661
00:54:41,720 --> 00:54:43,790
Shit!

662
00:54:47,320 --> 00:54:49,914
- Charlie?
- Hi, honey!

663
00:54:50,040 --> 00:54:53,271
- What are you doing here?
- What are you doing here?

664
00:54:54,480 --> 00:54:58,109
Wh... We had an anonymous call
reporting a body in the road.

665
00:54:58,240 --> 00:54:59,958
We just ran over it.

666
00:55:00,080 --> 00:55:02,355
Hi, I'm Josie McBroom.

667
00:55:02,480 --> 00:55:05,472
I thought you were having a drink
with your supervisor.

668
00:55:05,600 --> 00:55:09,912
Technically, I'm Junior Supervisor
but they did place Charlie under me.

669
00:55:10,920 --> 00:55:14,310
- Oh...
- And you must be...

670
00:55:14,440 --> 00:55:16,192
- Penelope Wood.
- Penelope.

671
00:55:16,320 --> 00:55:18,675
- Detective Penelope Wood.
- Of course!

672
00:55:18,800 --> 00:55:22,236
Charlie has told me a lot about you...

673
00:55:22,360 --> 00:55:25,113
Did he say he has a little girl
and that I brought her...

674
00:55:25,240 --> 00:55:28,676
- Emily's here?
...because there's no one at home?

675
00:55:28,800 --> 00:55:30,791
Now, what happened, exactly?

676
00:55:30,920 --> 00:55:34,629
Well, we were driving into town

677
00:55:34,760 --> 00:55:37,149
and all of a sudden - bang!

678
00:55:37,280 --> 00:55:40,636
We ran over this body here. There
was nothing I could do to avoid her.

679
00:55:40,760 --> 00:55:44,150
No one could have. I swear,
she just popped out of nowhere.

680
00:55:45,480 --> 00:55:48,756
- And you are?
- Who, me? I'm Gus.

681
00:55:48,880 --> 00:55:52,395
Gus Dickinson is my name.
A co-worker of Charlie's.

682
00:55:53,920 --> 00:55:56,912
- Who are you calling?
- My deputy.

683
00:56:05,480 --> 00:56:07,277
Aren't you gonna answer that?

684
00:56:08,560 --> 00:56:11,472
Uh-uh! It's probably
just my ex-boyfriend.

685
00:56:11,600 --> 00:56:13,750
Freakin' stalker, you know?

686
00:56:16,480 --> 00:56:21,076
Deputy Garmen, Detective Wood here.
You need to report in immediately.

687
00:56:21,200 --> 00:56:23,839
Detective Wood.

688
00:56:25,680 --> 00:56:27,477
Where?

689
00:56:29,160 --> 00:56:31,037
Shit!

690
00:56:31,160 --> 00:56:33,549
- The Eye is at the station.
- The what?

691
00:56:33,680 --> 00:56:38,629
All right, I want you all to follow me down
there. I'm gonna need your statements.

692
00:56:38,760 --> 00:56:42,116
Can't that wait till tomorrow?
I'm sure it more productive

693
00:56:42,240 --> 00:56:44,800
if we'd had a good night's sleep, right?

694
00:56:47,960 --> 00:56:51,475
You might have mentioned
that your wife was a detective.

695
00:56:51,600 --> 00:56:52,999
Shut up.

696
00:56:53,120 --> 00:56:56,192
Gus, you might have mentioned
about not really owing alimony

697
00:56:56,320 --> 00:57:00,108
to your imaginary wife and your
imaginary daughter not really going blind.

698
00:57:00,240 --> 00:57:02,390
<i>Touche!</i>

699
00:57:02,520 --> 00:57:05,796
Everyone, this is Special Agent
Chester Hymes.

700
00:57:05,920 --> 00:57:10,038
Well, can you beat this?
My friends with the bodies in the trunk.

701
00:57:11,600 --> 00:57:13,477
- What?
- It's an inside joke!

702
00:57:13,600 --> 00:57:16,398
We ran into each other earlier.
How do you do?

703
00:57:18,240 --> 00:57:21,198
- I'm ready.
- Charlie, can you look after Emmy.

704
00:57:21,320 --> 00:57:23,311
You two follow us.

705
00:57:25,600 --> 00:57:28,558
- We're screwed!
- Not if we keep out story straight.

706
00:57:28,680 --> 00:57:32,116
We had a few beers at Gus's place,
that's the end if it. Got it?

707
00:57:32,240 --> 00:57:34,674
Got it.

708
00:57:34,800 --> 00:57:36,438
Gus...

709
00:57:37,440 --> 00:57:39,908
- We're screwed!
- Oh, come on!

710
00:57:40,040 --> 00:57:42,838
Do you think Agent Hippo
is gonna figure out more

711
00:57:42,960 --> 00:57:45,474
than where to find a really great buffet?

712
00:57:45,600 --> 00:57:48,353
These abrasions on her knees
and elbows

713
00:57:48,480 --> 00:57:50,755
indicate a leap from a moving vehicle.

714
00:57:50,880 --> 00:57:54,475
We can deduce that Mrs Smalls'
would-be killer

715
00:57:54,600 --> 00:57:59,230
presupposed her already dead when
she was transported by automobile.

716
00:57:59,360 --> 00:58:02,909
Are you all right, Mr Dickinson?

717
00:58:03,040 --> 00:58:07,511
Er... yeah. This is the first dead body
for me, so...

718
00:58:08,560 --> 00:58:10,596
- And I drunk beers at my place.
- Yeah.

719
00:58:10,720 --> 00:58:14,235
Other than the axe wound,
which, judging from the angle of entry,

720
00:58:14,360 --> 00:58:17,750
came from a much shorter person,
possibly a female,

721
00:58:17,880 --> 00:58:21,509
nothing here indicates
any sort of fisticuffs ever took place.

722
00:58:21,640 --> 00:58:26,998
I can safely say that Mrs Smalls'
murderer can be found...

723
00:58:27,120 --> 00:58:29,031
within this very room.

724
00:58:29,160 --> 00:58:31,879
- What?
- Oh! Just a figure of speech!

725
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:36,596
What I mean to say is her body
will tell me who her killer is

726
00:58:36,720 --> 00:58:39,393
after a more thorough examination.

727
00:58:39,520 --> 00:58:43,035
However, I can hazard a name
right now.

728
00:58:43,160 --> 00:58:45,515
Please do.

729
00:58:45,640 --> 00:58:49,474
I'm sure it will come as no surprise
that her killer

730
00:58:49,600 --> 00:58:51,989
is none other than...

731
00:58:53,320 --> 00:58:55,754
...the Oregon Undertaker.

732
00:58:55,880 --> 00:58:59,759
Well, we all could have figured
that out, Agent Hymes.

733
00:58:59,880 --> 00:59:02,075
Indeed.

734
00:59:35,280 --> 00:59:37,555
Everything's gonna be OK, sweetie.

735
00:59:46,080 --> 00:59:50,790
Hey! So, er... I guess
I'll take Emily home.

736
00:59:50,920 --> 00:59:52,911
Why don't you leave her here with me?

737
00:59:54,240 --> 00:59:57,312
- Yah, but I can easily...
- Goodnight.

738
00:59:59,560 --> 01:00:03,519
Wait! You're not
going anywhere, little lady!

739
01:00:04,760 --> 01:00:07,069
Not without your coat.

740
01:00:15,520 --> 01:00:18,796
- Would anyone care to say something?
- Just take me home.

741
01:00:19,800 --> 01:00:22,394
No way! We've got a dead cop
to ditch first.

742
01:00:22,520 --> 01:00:26,433
I don't care about the cop. I don't
even care about the money anymore.

743
01:00:26,560 --> 01:00:30,235
I just wanna go home
and pretend this never happened.

744
01:00:30,360 --> 01:00:33,716
Yeah, it hasn't exactly been
a run-of-the-mill night on the town.

745
01:00:33,840 --> 01:00:36,308
All I wanted was to take care
of my family.

746
01:00:37,320 --> 01:00:42,155
OK, Charlie, the sooner we dispose
of the deputy's body,

747
01:00:42,280 --> 01:00:45,670
the sooner you can get started on your
pretend happily ever after.

748
01:00:45,800 --> 01:00:48,268
Now how does that sound?

749
01:00:48,400 --> 01:00:51,949
'You've reached Stu Garmen.
Speak after the beep... '

750
01:00:52,080 --> 01:00:53,672
Shit!

751
01:01:00,400 --> 01:01:04,359
Come on, sweetheart.
It's time to go home.

752
01:01:16,400 --> 01:01:18,391
Oh, Charlie...

753
01:01:46,720 --> 01:01:49,109
- You're sure he'll sink in there?
- Absolutely!

754
01:01:50,240 --> 01:01:52,231
- You've done this before?
- Never.

755
01:01:52,360 --> 01:01:55,830
Unrefined, unheated tar
has a viscosity grade of 250,000.

756
01:01:55,960 --> 01:01:58,758
So what does that mean?
He won't sink?

757
01:01:58,880 --> 01:02:03,351
He'll sink. It might take a week or so,
but he'll sink.

758
01:02:04,480 --> 01:02:07,870
Well... we better get started then.

759
01:02:25,480 --> 01:02:27,198
Hold it!

760
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:31,479
You followed us.

761
01:02:31,600 --> 01:02:36,469
I figured it would be more expedient
than listening to bull pucky testimony.

762
01:02:36,600 --> 01:02:39,478
I guess I was right, just like always.

763
01:02:39,600 --> 01:02:41,591
- OK...
- Listen...

764
01:02:41,720 --> 01:02:46,714
Agent Hymes, you let us go and there's
a million dollars with your name on it.

765
01:02:47,480 --> 01:02:50,916
You're offering a Federal agent
a bribe?

766
01:02:51,040 --> 01:02:53,429
- Yeah.
- Thanks, little lady.

767
01:02:54,600 --> 01:02:58,309
Gus, come over here for a second,
would you?

768
01:03:01,360 --> 01:03:03,635
Tell me I'm fat!

769
01:03:03,760 --> 01:03:06,149
I was joking!

770
01:03:06,280 --> 01:03:09,670
I wanna hear you tell the fat guy
how fat he is.

771
01:03:09,800 --> 01:03:12,314
I was kidding, all right?

772
01:03:13,160 --> 01:03:15,151
You might be a little on the heavy side

773
01:03:15,280 --> 01:03:18,033
but it's nothing that a few centuries
jogging can't fix!

774
01:03:18,160 --> 01:03:22,312
- Argh! Sonofabitch!
- I'm sorry, did that pinch?

775
01:03:22,440 --> 01:03:28,356
All right, the official version is that
Gus here attacked me during an arrest.

776
01:03:28,480 --> 01:03:32,314
- And I was defending myself...
- Stupid walrus... Argh!

777
01:03:32,440 --> 01:03:37,798
The official version is that Gus tripped
and fell on his face during the arrest.

778
01:03:37,920 --> 01:03:43,040
Ok, there's two million dollars in a bag
in the car. It's all yours, just take it.

779
01:03:43,160 --> 01:03:46,789
Wow! Can you beat that?
One million just became two million.

780
01:03:46,920 --> 01:03:50,629
And people said this economy
would never bounce back!

781
01:03:50,760 --> 01:03:52,876
Argh!

782
01:03:56,840 --> 01:03:59,877
- Shoot him in the fucking eye!
- What? Shut up!

783
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:01,433
- Wait!
- Don't move!

784
01:04:03,200 --> 01:04:05,760
- I know who you are.
- What?

785
01:04:05,880 --> 01:04:11,432
I thought you looked familiar...
Fellas, your accomplice is Lucy Bloom,

786
01:04:11,560 --> 01:04:16,429
AKA Lucy McJoseph,
AKA Josie McBroom.

787
01:04:16,560 --> 01:04:20,519
- What are you talking about?
- You're the Wyoming Widow.

788
01:04:20,640 --> 01:04:22,312
What?

789
01:04:22,440 --> 01:04:25,876
Gentlemen, the Wyoming Widow's
MO is always the same.

790
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:31,279
She seduces an unsuspecting fellow,
she fornicates with him

791
01:04:31,400 --> 01:04:33,789
and then she offers up
a little sip of whiskey.

792
01:04:33,920 --> 01:04:38,152
The poor sucker never lives long enough
to realise that he also just drank

793
01:04:38,280 --> 01:04:40,510
highly concentrated thallium.

794
01:04:40,640 --> 01:04:44,394
You've been watching too many
soap operas, Agent Hymes!

795
01:04:47,880 --> 01:04:50,189
You're not believing this crap, are you?

796
01:04:50,320 --> 01:04:54,632
They say that she always keeps
her trusty flask on her person,

797
01:04:54,760 --> 01:04:58,309
just in case the next bug
flies into her web.

798
01:04:58,440 --> 01:05:03,594
Oh, come on! He's just making
this crap up to save his ass!

799
01:05:03,720 --> 01:05:08,669
I could have sworn I felt one inside
of her coat pocket back at the station.

800
01:05:11,440 --> 01:05:13,396
Empty your pockets, Josie.

801
01:05:15,200 --> 01:05:17,634
Charlie...

802
01:05:25,920 --> 01:05:27,433
Holy shit!

803
01:05:27,560 --> 01:05:30,870
You planted this in my coat
back at the station, didn't you?

804
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:32,831
No, I didn't. I swear to God!

805
01:05:32,960 --> 01:05:34,757
This isn't mine.

806
01:05:34,880 --> 01:05:39,192
- He is lying. He is lying!
- Take a drink.

807
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:43,514
- Oh...
- Take a sip, Josie.

808
01:05:51,280 --> 01:05:53,953
There.

809
01:05:55,040 --> 01:05:57,918
Are you ha...

810
01:05:58,040 --> 01:06:00,349
- Josie?
- Oh, my God!

811
01:06:00,480 --> 01:06:04,075
Oh, God! Josie!
Come on, spit it out!

812
01:06:07,360 --> 01:06:10,511
- You are so pathetic!
- That was not funny.

813
01:06:13,800 --> 01:06:18,351
You dumb shits! I told you he was just
trying to mess with us! Fuck! Fuck!

814
01:07:26,520 --> 01:07:28,511
Jesus!

815
01:07:32,640 --> 01:07:34,471
I think that belongs to Uncle Sam.

816
01:07:34,600 --> 01:07:37,592
Now hold on.
We're on the same side here, Chester.

817
01:07:40,200 --> 01:07:42,077
I'm an agent too.

818
01:07:47,480 --> 01:07:50,790
- When the hell did you take that off me?
- Back at the station.

819
01:07:52,520 --> 01:07:55,910
Listen, here's the thing, Gus -

820
01:07:56,040 --> 01:07:58,952
there's a friend of mine,
an agent, one of the best.

821
01:07:59,080 --> 01:08:01,594
He's been protecting the innocent
a long time now.

822
01:08:01,720 --> 01:08:04,393
And, well...

823
01:08:04,520 --> 01:08:06,954
he's gotten fed up
with working his ass off

824
01:08:07,080 --> 01:08:10,709
for ungrateful morons
who call him fatty.

825
01:08:11,800 --> 01:08:13,791
A pat on the back if things go right,

826
01:08:13,920 --> 01:08:16,718
or the stars and stripes on his coffin
if they don't.

827
01:08:16,840 --> 01:08:18,831
It just doesn't cut it anymore.

828
01:08:20,960 --> 01:08:22,757
I have two million here.

829
01:08:22,880 --> 01:08:25,599
Believe when I say
no one will ever claim it.

830
01:08:25,720 --> 01:08:29,429
Tell your friend there's a million for him
and a million for me.

831
01:08:29,560 --> 01:08:33,712
What about two million for him
and nothing for you.

832
01:08:33,840 --> 01:08:36,593
Oh, come on, Chetty!
We're partners here.

833
01:08:36,720 --> 01:08:40,508
You insult me, Gus.
You're not even a real criminal.

834
01:08:40,640 --> 01:08:43,029
You're just a small-time crook

835
01:08:43,160 --> 01:08:45,720
who got shot twice in the chest
resisting arrest.

836
01:08:46,880 --> 01:08:49,553
Listen, I have a daughter, Thais...

837
01:08:49,680 --> 01:08:53,958
Thais. That's Greek for 'Beloved'.

838
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:01,913
- You shot me.
- That's the first true thing you've said.

839
01:09:19,360 --> 01:09:21,555
What took you so long?

840
01:10:00,680 --> 01:10:02,477
Mummy...

841
01:10:03,480 --> 01:10:06,472
It's all right, sweetheart.
Go back to sleep.

842
01:10:17,320 --> 01:10:20,357
Wait! You know I can't eat
this much sugar.

843
01:10:20,480 --> 01:10:22,948
You shouldn't do this.

844
01:10:23,080 --> 01:10:26,197
- Like you shouldn't have killed Gus.
- Keep eating.

845
01:10:28,240 --> 01:10:30,959
Gus was a backstabber.

846
01:10:31,080 --> 01:10:34,436
He told me he was gonna kill you
and make off with the money.

847
01:10:35,600 --> 01:10:40,037
That's why I killed him. I saved your life.
I'm telling you the truth!

848
01:10:40,160 --> 01:10:44,676
89.9 percent of all US Government
agents can beat a lie detector.

849
01:10:46,400 --> 01:10:49,312
Please... this isn't right, Charlie.

850
01:10:49,440 --> 01:10:52,034
You know this isn't right.

851
01:10:52,160 --> 01:10:55,835
- Your wife is an officer of the law.
- Shut up! Shut the fuck up!

852
01:10:58,200 --> 01:11:00,395
Oh, God.

853
01:11:00,520 --> 01:11:03,432
I don't wanna die!

854
01:11:03,560 --> 01:11:06,313
I don't wanna die...

855
01:11:06,440 --> 01:11:09,796
Please... Oh...

856
01:11:22,280 --> 01:11:25,431
- God, we really did it, huh?
- What?

857
01:11:25,560 --> 01:11:27,790
We really turned into monsters.

858
01:11:29,800 --> 01:11:31,392
Oh, Charlie...

859
01:11:35,600 --> 01:11:37,591
Oh, come on.

860
01:11:37,720 --> 01:11:40,314
I say it was worth it.

861
01:11:41,400 --> 01:11:44,437
Let's get the body in the car.
It's heavy enough to sink.

862
01:11:44,560 --> 01:11:46,949
Wait...

863
01:11:47,080 --> 01:11:49,833
There's still one passenger missing.

864
01:11:54,720 --> 01:11:59,032
You said you wanted to pretend
none of this ever happened...

865
01:12:00,440 --> 01:12:04,911
One sip of this... and you can kiss
all your worries goodbye.

866
01:12:07,640 --> 01:12:10,438
- The Wyoming Widow?
- Yeah.

867
01:12:12,520 --> 01:12:15,717
But I saw you drink it.

868
01:12:15,840 --> 01:12:18,752
Never far from my trusty flasks!

869
01:12:20,080 --> 01:12:21,479
- Brilliant.
- Yeah!

870
01:12:21,600 --> 01:12:25,593
After all, I was Miss Teen Wyoming.

871
01:12:26,560 --> 01:12:30,838
Now, Obviously I can't let you go
and risk having you report me

872
01:12:30,960 --> 01:12:35,636
and, fuck, two million does sound
a heck of a lot nicer than one million!

873
01:12:36,680 --> 01:12:39,558
- You were right, Penny.
- What's that?

874
01:12:40,680 --> 01:12:43,513
Penelope always said money
won't make you rich, I just...

875
01:12:43,640 --> 01:12:46,154
I just didn't believe her.

876
01:12:47,560 --> 01:12:51,030
You do seem like
a genuinely decent guy, Charlie.

877
01:12:51,160 --> 01:12:54,835
- I'm real sorry I gotta do this.
- You don't have a choice, do you?

878
01:12:54,960 --> 01:12:57,520
No, I don't. But you do.

879
01:12:57,640 --> 01:13:01,758
You want me to shoot you
or you want to go for the whiskey?

880
01:13:04,840 --> 01:13:06,831
What did Hymes say you used?

881
01:13:06,960 --> 01:13:10,396
Concentrated thallium.
Much quicker than cyanide.

882
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:19,116
Any last words, Charlie?

883
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:23,991
Don't spend it all at one place.

884
01:13:25,480 --> 01:13:27,277
What?

885
01:13:37,920 --> 01:13:41,708
What? What?

886
01:13:41,840 --> 01:13:43,876
What?

887
01:13:46,720 --> 01:13:50,429
No! Oh!

888
01:13:50,560 --> 01:13:53,279
What the fuck?

889
01:13:53,400 --> 01:13:57,996
Oh fuck! Oh fuck! Fuck!

890
01:14:24,160 --> 01:14:28,153
'Charlie, Penelope
and Emily can't come to the phone.

- Hi. Where you headed?

901
01:15:56,960 --> 01:16:00,873
- As far away from here as possible.
- That one we could do for you.

902
01:16:02,360 --> 01:16:05,158
This must be my lucky day.

903
01:16:08,360 --> 01:16:11,158
Er... let me just double-check
something.

904
01:16:27,800 --> 01:16:30,439
- All set.
- All righty!

905

Thank you.
