1
00:02:01,496 --> 00:02:03,749
Hector, are we spinning yet?
Nice.

2
00:02:03,874 --> 00:02:07,377
Chelios! How we doing, baby?
And you never call me no more.

3
00:02:07,544 --> 00:02:09,922
Come on, what is that?
Where's the love?

4
00:02:10,047 --> 00:02:12,007
How are you feeling?

5
00:02:12,174 --> 00:02:15,093
I guess you're feeling like shit,
right about now.

6
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:16,428
You can't...

7
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:18,722
You can't move too good, huh?

8
00:02:18,889 --> 00:02:22,017
You can't breathe too good.
What's wrong with you?

9
00:02:22,184 --> 00:02:24,394
Wait, wait, wait, wait!
What is this?

10
00:02:26,438 --> 00:02:28,106
Oh, fuck!

11
00:02:28,273 --> 00:02:31,527
Can you guess what this is?
I bet you can, Chelios.

12
00:02:31,693 --> 00:02:34,029
Hold on, check this out.

13
00:02:39,284 --> 00:02:43,247
Oh! This is plain sick, man!

14
00:02:43,539 --> 00:02:46,583
I must be the motherfucking genius of sick!

15
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:52,589
Poison Chev Chelios in his sleep?
That's like some Shakespeare or some shit.

16
00:02:52,756 --> 00:02:57,803
You knocked this dude out pretty good!
About to get you a spot on the Dodgers, son.

17
00:02:58,053 --> 00:03:01,139
Maybe you
don't understand what just happened.

18
00:03:01,306 --> 00:03:04,268
I just fucking killed you.

19
00:03:04,434 --> 00:03:08,397
Try not to embarrass yourself
because you're on 'Candid Camera'!

20
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:11,567
This shit here I gave you!
This is some...

21
00:03:11,775 --> 00:03:15,779
high-tech, sci-fi,
Chinese synthetic bullshit!

22
00:03:15,946 --> 00:03:19,116
I don't exactly know
what's in this shit, dude!

23
00:03:19,283 --> 00:03:23,787
All I know is that once this shit
has binded with your blood cells,

24
00:03:23,954 --> 00:03:26,832
you're fucked, baby,
and believe me it's binded.

25
00:03:26,999 --> 00:03:30,961
Yeah, you got yourself about an hour, max.
Tick-tock.

26
00:03:31,336 --> 00:03:35,340
Yeah, baby... sexy...
Oh, it's been real.

27
00:03:35,507 --> 00:03:40,095
This shit's been real. You should've thought
twice before you whacked Don Kim.

28
00:03:42,306 --> 00:03:45,142
Experiencing a little 20/20 hindsight?

29
00:03:45,309 --> 00:03:46,977
I thought so.

30
00:03:47,144 --> 00:03:51,190
Now, you have yourself a nice death.

31
00:03:54,526 --> 00:03:55,611
Asshole!

32
00:04:01,825 --> 00:04:04,536
You like that, huh?
Home run!

33
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:05,848
What do you think you're doing?
You can't just walk on my car!

34
00:05:06,014 --> 00:05:09,601
What do you think you're doing,
motherfucker, walking on my car?

35
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:37,963
<i>It's Eve.
I'm glad you called, but I'm not here.</i>

36
00:05:38,463 --> 00:05:42,801
<i>Leave a message, unless you're
selling something, cause I'm not interested.</i>

37
00:05:42,968 --> 00:05:46,722
<i>If you're not, then just...
Wait, time's up.</i>

38
00:05:48,098 --> 00:05:51,476
Get a cell phone, honey.
Please?

39
00:05:55,647 --> 00:05:57,441
Come on.

40
00:05:57,649 --> 00:05:58,942
Come on.

41
00:05:59,776 --> 00:06:03,739
Dr. Miles office, may I help you?
- Yeah, let me speak to him.

42
00:06:03,906 --> 00:06:07,451
<i>I'm sorry, but the doctor isn't in.
May I take a message?</i>

43
00:06:07,659 --> 00:06:10,245
Where is he?
- I beg your pardon, sir?

44
00:06:10,412 --> 00:06:12,247
Where the fuck is he?

45
00:06:12,414 --> 00:06:13,832
No... yeah!

46
00:06:17,753 --> 00:06:19,129
Wow!

47
00:06:23,133 --> 00:06:24,843
Where you from?

48
00:06:25,469 --> 00:06:28,430
I don't know, sir.
This is his answering service.

49
00:06:28,597 --> 00:06:31,808
<i>Jesus fucking Christ.
- Would you like me to page him?</i>

50
00:06:31,975 --> 00:06:33,352
Yeah, fine.

51
00:06:33,477 --> 00:06:37,481
Please let the doctor know
that Chev Chelios is a dead man,

52
00:06:37,648 --> 00:06:42,027
if he can't call me back within the hour.
- Could you spell that?

53
00:06:42,194 --> 00:06:45,781
<i>Yeah, D-E-A-D! Chelios.
- Yes, sir.</i>

54
00:06:45,948 --> 00:06:47,866
Thank you.

55
00:07:30,033 --> 00:07:32,744
Hello.
- Kaylo, where were you last night?

56
00:07:32,911 --> 00:07:36,874
What's up, Chev?
- I said, where were you last night?

57
00:07:37,249 --> 00:07:39,084
I...

58
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:50,929
<i>Well, want to know what I was doing?
- What?</i>

59
00:07:51,221 --> 00:07:53,223
Getting killed, you plum.
- What?

60
00:07:53,515 --> 00:07:57,227
Yeah, you heard me.
Ricky fuckin, Verona...

61
00:07:57,394 --> 00:07:59,354
<i>Ricky Verona?
- Who'd a thought...</i>

62
00:07:59,521 --> 00:08:03,025
that little bitch had the stones
to wet me in my own crib?

63
00:08:03,233 --> 00:08:07,196
<i>I mean, it's inconceivable. Yet, here we are.
- Where are we?</i>

64
00:08:07,362 --> 00:08:12,868
I'm dead and you're simple. Now listen to me.
Put the word out I'm looking for Verona.

65
00:08:13,076 --> 00:08:16,288
<i>Anyone sees him you call me, understand?
- I...</i>

66
00:08:16,455 --> 00:08:20,125
I'm gonna get that little fucker
if it's the last thing I do.

67
00:08:20,292 --> 00:08:23,629
It may actually be the last thing I do.

68
00:08:23,754 --> 00:08:25,714
You understand?
- Ricky Verona.

69
00:08:25,881 --> 00:08:27,424
<i>You copy?
- Yeah.</i>

70
00:08:27,758 --> 00:08:29,801
Find him!

71
00:08:55,786 --> 00:08:57,913
Hey, man!

72
00:08:59,122 --> 00:09:02,668
What the fuck you doing? Where am I going?
- Fuck you!

73
00:09:02,835 --> 00:09:05,462
Bathroom don't work.
What you doing?

74
00:09:05,629 --> 00:09:07,756
Yo, Chevy...
- Where's Verona?

75
00:09:07,923 --> 00:09:09,466
Talk!
- What about?

76
00:09:09,633 --> 00:09:12,469
Don't fuck with me!
- I'm not! Just calm down!

77
00:09:12,636 --> 00:09:14,263
Don't tell me to calm down!

78
00:09:14,471 --> 00:09:16,640
Fuck, man!
- Orlando? You all right?

79
00:09:16,807 --> 00:09:21,937
Hey, there's a white nigger with a gun
up in here! Just be still, motherfuckers!

80
00:09:22,104 --> 00:09:26,275
You see that?
I'm trying to help you here, man.

81
00:09:26,441 --> 00:09:27,985
I gotta find Ricky Verona.

82
00:09:28,151 --> 00:09:31,154
Why would I know where Verona is?
- Yeah, yeah.

83
00:09:31,321 --> 00:09:33,866
You don't know, but you're gonna tell me.

84
00:09:34,157 --> 00:09:37,536
Or I'm gonna
blow your brains into the fuckin, toilet!

85
00:09:38,871 --> 00:09:40,539
I'm gonna fucking kill him!

86
00:09:41,498 --> 00:09:44,835
Whoa! Put your guns down!
The white man is cool!

87
00:09:45,002 --> 00:09:48,630
The white man is...
The white man is cool!

88
00:09:51,133 --> 00:09:53,051
Y'all like them Somalia niggers.

89
00:09:53,969 --> 00:09:57,014
Now look, Chevy
came here to discuss something.

90
00:09:57,181 --> 00:10:00,559
We gonna discuss
this shit in a civilized manner. Chevy?

91
00:10:01,018 --> 00:10:04,897
You had a question? Or a point to make?
- Where's Verona?

92
00:10:05,022 --> 00:10:08,734
Okay, I'm not affiliated with Ricky Verona.

93
00:10:08,901 --> 00:10:12,738
You pulled the Anselmo job together.
Don't fuckin, bullshit me!

94
00:10:12,905 --> 00:10:15,490
Easy! Easy! Easy!

95
00:10:15,657 --> 00:10:18,869
All right?
Things are beginning to clarify.

96
00:10:19,369 --> 00:10:22,206
See how that works, D?
Discussion leads to clarity.

97
00:10:22,372 --> 00:10:24,666
That's what I was telling you before.

98
00:10:24,833 --> 00:10:29,338
Look, you're operating under a false
pretence. Ricky and I did not pull...

99
00:10:29,505 --> 00:10:33,217
the Anselmo job together.
Ricky fucked me on the Anselmo job.

100
00:10:33,509 --> 00:10:37,262
In fact, Ricky Verona still owes me $7,500.

101
00:10:37,429 --> 00:10:40,432
Not how I heard it.
- But that's the way it is.

102
00:10:40,557 --> 00:10:44,061
So, you see, I don't know where Verona is.
If I did,

103
00:10:44,228 --> 00:10:47,940
I'd probably be there right now,
beating the Gucci off his ass.

104
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:51,026
All right.

105
00:10:53,904 --> 00:10:54,947
All right.

106
00:10:55,197 --> 00:10:59,409
That's what I'm talking about.
That's almost civilized.

107
00:11:07,626 --> 00:11:09,920
Shit, dude.
What's wrong with you?

108
00:11:11,922 --> 00:11:14,091
I gotta find Ricky Verona.

109
00:11:14,925 --> 00:11:19,763
Well, obviously. You've made that point
abundantly clear to all of us here, today.

110
00:11:20,389 --> 00:11:24,434
How can I help you?
- Just give me some coke. You got any coke?

111
00:11:25,310 --> 00:11:28,146
Now you're just going to
come in here and insult me?

112
00:11:28,313 --> 00:11:31,066
I know you got coke.
- You think every brother's carrying?

113
00:11:31,233 --> 00:11:32,901
Come on, I don't have time!

114
00:11:33,944 --> 00:11:36,613
Just give me something.

115
00:11:36,780 --> 00:11:39,324
I'm really dying, here.
- I can see that.

116
00:11:39,491 --> 00:11:42,160
No, I'm really fucking dying!

117
00:11:42,661 --> 00:11:44,955
Look, if I don't find Ricky Verona...

118
00:11:47,666 --> 00:11:49,585
May I please have some coke?

119
00:11:50,669 --> 00:11:55,299
You saying this is medicinal-use coke?
- That's right.

120
00:11:59,970 --> 00:12:01,972
Well?

121
00:12:03,140 --> 00:12:07,644
What?
- This shit ain't free, nigger.

122
00:12:11,523 --> 00:12:14,484
That's enough.

123
00:12:21,491 --> 00:12:24,953
What, you gonna do the shit right here?
Chevy, come on, man!

124
00:12:27,122 --> 00:12:29,208
Oh, God!

125
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:31,502
Chevy...

126
00:12:31,668 --> 00:12:33,128
What the...

127
00:12:33,295 --> 00:12:37,716
Oh, that's good. That's good.
- That's good, right?

128
00:12:41,678 --> 00:12:44,139
Why you looking for Verona, anyway?

129
00:12:53,524 --> 00:12:56,527
Some Chinese assholes hired him to kill me.

130
00:12:56,693 --> 00:12:59,738
This is about Don Kim.
- What do you know about it?

131
00:13:00,239 --> 00:13:04,076
I know you pulled the trigger.
- Of course, I pulled the trigger.

132
00:13:04,243 --> 00:13:07,162
Why wouldn't I pull the fuckin, trigger?

133
00:13:08,914 --> 00:13:13,335
Whoa... Yo, Chelios, you good?

134
00:13:13,710 --> 00:13:16,088
This shit ain't working.
- Excuse me?

135
00:13:16,713 --> 00:13:18,382
I know what I have to do.

136
00:13:20,342 --> 00:13:24,596
Well, shit.
A man's got to do what a man's got to do.

137
00:13:25,097 --> 00:13:28,517
What is it you gotta do?
- I gotta kick some black ass.

138
00:13:28,892 --> 00:13:30,269
What?

139
00:13:32,229 --> 00:13:35,065
Shit!
- There he goes again.

140
00:13:35,566 --> 00:13:38,944
Who wants white meat?

141
00:13:46,743 --> 00:13:49,413
You ain't got shit, motherfucker!

142
00:13:49,580 --> 00:13:52,749
Put that fuckin, twig down, bitch!
- Faggot!

143
00:13:56,295 --> 00:13:58,797
Get the fuck out of here, bitch!

144
00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:07,556
<i>Doc?
- What's up, Doc?</i>

145
00:14:07,764 --> 00:14:10,726
You motherfucker!
- Why aren't you dead yet?

146
00:14:10,893 --> 00:14:13,312
<i>What the fuck you doing?
- Coming for you.</i>

147
00:14:13,478 --> 00:14:15,564
Fucking believe me.
- Whatever.

148
00:14:15,731 --> 00:14:18,150
I'll be waiting,
but you won't make it.

149
00:14:18,567 --> 00:14:24,156
You should know that I'm all about hooking up
with that mystery girl, you've been banging.

150
00:14:24,323 --> 00:14:30,454
<i>Soon as you're underground. I forgot
to say so on that gay James Bond tape I left.</i>

151
00:14:30,621 --> 00:14:35,334
What, and then you're gonna rape my
grandmother? Bla, bla, fuckin, bla.

152
00:14:35,501 --> 00:14:40,422
You listen to me. What do you think Carlito
will do when he finds out what you did?

153
00:14:40,589 --> 00:14:42,508
<i>Your whole crew is history!</i>

154
00:14:42,758 --> 00:14:44,676
<i>Driver, pull over!
- Fuck!</i>

155
00:14:44,801 --> 00:14:47,012
Great.

156
00:14:47,179 --> 00:14:51,808
<i>You talking about Carlito?
Because me and Carlito, we're boys now.</i>

157
00:14:51,975 --> 00:14:53,101
We're tight.

158
00:14:53,435 --> 00:14:56,480
Tight, like when your brother
fucked you in 3rd grade?

159
00:14:56,688 --> 00:15:01,527
That's snappy. But I did you pretty good,
didn't I Chelios?

160
00:15:01,693 --> 00:15:03,153
<i>Admit it.
- We'll see.</i>

161
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:04,655
<i>Pull over!</i>

162
00:15:06,156 --> 00:15:12,329
Know what the best part is?
- Sorry, must go. Bye-bye.

163
00:15:14,289 --> 00:15:16,458
Yeah.
- Doctor Miles.

164
00:15:16,625 --> 00:15:19,127
<i>Fuck! What took you so long?
Jesus Christ.</i>

165
00:15:19,294 --> 00:15:23,674
Sorry, Chevy, I just got the message.
- Okay. Forget it. Listen, I'm dying!

166
00:15:23,841 --> 00:15:26,385
I've been poisoned
with some Chinese synthetic shit.

167
00:15:27,177 --> 00:15:30,138
<i>What?
- You've gotta fucking do something for me.</i>

168
00:15:30,305 --> 00:15:33,559
<i>What are your symptoms?
- It's like I'm slowing down.</i>

169
00:15:33,725 --> 00:15:35,686
<i>Stuck in tar.
- Blurred vision?</i>

170
00:15:36,019 --> 00:15:37,688
<i>Yeah.
- Dizzy?</i>

171
00:15:37,855 --> 00:15:40,065
<i>Sure.
- Any pain in your chest?</i>

172
00:15:40,232 --> 00:15:42,568
Not really.
I feel good, right now.

173
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:48,073
What are you doing?
- Driving through a mall, cops chasing me.

174
00:15:56,498 --> 00:15:59,418
The adrenaline is what's keeping you alive.

175
00:16:00,544 --> 00:16:04,673
<i>Having a little trouble hearing you.
- You got to keep moving, Chevy.</i>

176
00:16:08,343 --> 00:16:09,386
Explain.

177
00:16:09,553 --> 00:16:13,015
If I'm right,
they gave you the Beijing cocktail.

178
00:16:13,390 --> 00:16:16,018
<i>It's very nasty shit.</i>

179
00:16:18,729 --> 00:16:22,024
<i>It works on the adrenal gland,
blocks it's receptors.</i>

180
00:16:24,902 --> 00:16:29,781
<i>The only thing you can do to slow it down,
is to keep the flow of adrenaline constant.</i>

181
00:16:32,034 --> 00:16:34,119
Meaning, if you stop, you die.

182
00:16:34,286 --> 00:16:35,370
Hang on.

183
00:16:38,624 --> 00:16:39,958
<i>Jesus! What...</i>

184
00:16:40,125 --> 00:16:42,127
<i>Are you there?
Are you okay?</i>

185
00:16:44,379 --> 00:16:48,258
<i>What'd you say, Doc?
- If you stop, you die!</i>

186
00:16:52,095 --> 00:16:56,141
That's what I'm trying to do.
Keep moving, keep the blood pumping.

187
00:16:58,101 --> 00:16:59,895
<i>Chevy, you there?</i>

188
00:17:01,396 --> 00:17:05,651
Every time I slow down,
it's like my veins start to rust.

189
00:17:06,485 --> 00:17:09,446
<i>Did you take anything?
- Couple grams of coke.</i>

190
00:17:09,613 --> 00:17:12,616
<i>That's a start.
I'll be in L.A. In an hour.</i>

191
00:17:12,783 --> 00:17:16,912
<i>I'll call you as soon as I get there.
Do not stop moving!</i>

192
00:17:22,459 --> 00:17:25,254
Taxi! Yo, yo, yo!

193
00:17:28,924 --> 00:17:30,634
Go!
- Where we go?

194
00:17:30,801 --> 00:17:33,470
Just drive!

195
00:17:36,348 --> 00:17:39,017
Would you mind...
- Where you want to go, man?

196
00:17:39,184 --> 00:17:41,186
Right.

197
00:17:47,442 --> 00:17:49,152
Oh, shit!
- Go right!

198
00:17:49,319 --> 00:17:51,989
Okay! Yes!
- Go fucking right!

199
00:18:04,042 --> 00:18:05,544
Crank the music.

200
00:18:10,132 --> 00:18:12,176
Crank it!

201
00:18:14,511 --> 00:18:17,848
<i>But don't tell my heart, my achy breaky heart</i>

202
00:18:18,015 --> 00:18:21,810
<i>I just don't think he'd understand</i>

203
00:18:21,977 --> 00:18:25,856
<i>And if you tell my heart,
my achy breaky heart</i>

204
00:18:26,064 --> 00:18:30,319
<i>It might blow up and kill this man</i>

205
00:18:37,534 --> 00:18:39,077
Pull over, pull over.

206
00:18:40,829 --> 00:18:45,709
Thanks, mate. I'll be back in one minute.
- Okay, cowboy.

207
00:18:51,215 --> 00:18:52,341
Hey, buddy!

208
00:18:55,552 --> 00:18:58,013
You move, you die.

209
00:19:40,973 --> 00:19:43,475
<i>Hey, it's Eve. I'm glad you called...
- Fuck!</i>

210
00:19:56,238 --> 00:19:57,447
Where to, man?

211
00:19:58,615 --> 00:20:00,784
Beverly Hills.

212
00:21:11,021 --> 00:21:12,898
Chevy!
- Hey, boss.

213
00:21:14,024 --> 00:21:15,734
What a surprise.

214
00:21:15,901 --> 00:21:19,905
Something urgent has come up.
- So I've heard.

215
00:21:21,198 --> 00:21:22,908
Word travels fast.

216
00:21:23,867 --> 00:21:28,038
Well, then you know what happened.
- You amaze me, my friend.

217
00:21:28,705 --> 00:21:30,582
Well, what can I say?

218
00:21:30,749 --> 00:21:33,919
Carlito, I need your help.
I don't have a lot of time.

219
00:21:34,086 --> 00:21:39,091
No, not much.
- Yeah, we...

220
00:21:40,092 --> 00:21:42,594
We've gotta find an antidote, or something.

221
00:21:44,346 --> 00:21:48,183
What's the matter?
- That shit they gave you...

222
00:21:48,350 --> 00:21:50,435
It's that Chinese shit.

223
00:21:50,602 --> 00:21:54,940
There is no antidote.
I wish there was something I could do.

224
00:21:55,107 --> 00:21:57,568
What, that's it?
- Honestly,

225
00:21:58,443 --> 00:22:01,071
you should be dead already.

226
00:22:01,238 --> 00:22:03,240
It's a miracle.
- A miracle?

227
00:22:03,407 --> 00:22:05,117
We give that shit to horses.

228
00:22:05,534 --> 00:22:09,121
I don't fucking believe this.
- I'm sorry.

229
00:22:09,288 --> 00:22:12,374
You don't have to be
so damn fucking cool about it!

230
00:22:15,043 --> 00:22:19,047
What do you expect me to do?
- Find that punk Verona,

231
00:22:19,214 --> 00:22:23,802
and his whole fucking crew,
and feed them to a cage of wolverines.

232
00:22:25,596 --> 00:22:29,975
What is this?
What, are you boys now or something?

233
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:31,977
Verona?

234
00:22:33,061 --> 00:22:34,771
That's a small time punk.

235
00:22:36,064 --> 00:22:39,610
Not to say that this isn't an opportunity.
- Opportunity?

236
00:22:40,152 --> 00:22:42,988
Everyone knows
the love I have for you, Chev.

237
00:22:43,155 --> 00:22:47,075
But maybe this
makes up for the Don Kim hit which was...

238
00:22:47,242 --> 00:22:50,162
perhaps ill-advised.
- Fuckin, Ill-advised?

239
00:22:52,623 --> 00:22:56,168
The heat from Hong Kong was
much more than we anticipated.

240
00:22:56,335 --> 00:22:58,670
Well, that's outstanding, Carlito.

241
00:22:59,588 --> 00:23:02,758
Glad to know my death
can be of some use to you.

242
00:23:03,467 --> 00:23:06,929
Don't be difficult.
- I'm not being difficult.

243
00:23:07,095 --> 00:23:11,600
I don't know if you noticed, but I'm
having a difficult fucking day, brother!

244
00:23:13,644 --> 00:23:15,812
Are you disrespecting me?

245
00:23:17,981 --> 00:23:20,150
Is that what you're doing?

246
00:23:27,533 --> 00:23:30,452
Forget it.
I'm out of here.

247
00:23:59,398 --> 00:24:02,234
You're not getting in my cab, wet!

248
00:24:02,401 --> 00:24:07,823
I just gave you $200 to wait for 3 minutes.
- You're not getting in my car, no way!

249
00:24:09,074 --> 00:24:10,909
Yeah, you're right.

250
00:24:13,036 --> 00:24:15,539
Al-Qaeda!
Al-Qaeda!

251
00:24:17,875 --> 00:24:20,252
I love America!
I love Bush!

252
00:24:21,211 --> 00:24:22,588
I Voted Bush!

253
00:24:39,521 --> 00:24:41,899
Yeah.
- Hey, Chev. My flight's delayed.

254
00:24:42,191 --> 00:24:44,443
<i>Shit!
- It's all right. Relax.</i>

255
00:24:44,776 --> 00:24:49,740
I mean, don't relax. That shit they
gave you is cutting off your adrenaline.

256
00:24:50,073 --> 00:24:55,746
<i>Excitement, fear, danger. It causes your
body to make a chemical called ephedrine.</i>

257
00:24:56,580 --> 00:24:59,583
<i>They introduced an inhibitor to your system.
- Fuck!</i>

258
00:24:59,750 --> 00:25:03,795
<i>You've got to massively
increase the ephedrine level in your body,</i>

259
00:25:03,962 --> 00:25:06,632
<i>to force out the inhibitors.
Go to a hospital.</i>

260
00:25:06,798 --> 00:25:09,301
Get epinephrine, an artificial adrenaline.

261
00:25:09,801 --> 00:25:12,638
<i>It comes in 10-milligram syringes.</i>

262
00:25:12,888 --> 00:25:16,600
A 5th of an injection will do.
It's potent, so don't overdo it.

263
00:25:17,267 --> 00:25:19,770
Chevy? Did you get that?

264
00:25:21,271 --> 00:25:24,566
<i>Did you get that?
- Yeah, epi-something.</i>

265
00:25:25,817 --> 00:25:27,569
Okay, okay. I've gotta go.

266
00:25:27,945 --> 00:25:31,740
<i>Now, I'll call you when I get there.</i>

267
00:25:31,907 --> 00:25:34,827
<i>Yeah?
- Chev.</i>

268
00:25:34,952 --> 00:25:35,994
Yeah?

269
00:25:36,286 --> 00:25:37,788
Chev?
- What?

270
00:25:38,664 --> 00:25:40,666
<i>Hello?</i>

271
00:25:42,751 --> 00:25:43,961
Come on!

272
00:25:44,127 --> 00:25:45,504
Mother!

273
00:25:47,798 --> 00:25:49,675
<i>Chev?
- Yes, fuck?</i>

274
00:25:50,300 --> 00:25:54,096
I just saw Verona's brother
walk into the Prince.

275
00:25:54,263 --> 00:25:55,973
The Prince.
- Yeah.

276
00:25:56,139 --> 00:26:00,352
I was just down here getting a taco,
and he walked in, 2 minutes ago.

277
00:26:04,815 --> 00:26:08,193
Where are you, now?
- Across the street, getting a taco.

278
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:12,447
Where are you?
- I'm there. Meet me on 7th and Catalina.

279
00:26:34,678 --> 00:26:37,723
Is he in there, now?

280
00:26:37,890 --> 00:26:40,225
Did anyone go in with him?

281
00:26:44,188 --> 00:26:45,981
Right, wait here.

282
00:27:59,221 --> 00:28:05,102
How'd you like that one, tough guy?
How frickin, awesome was that, huh?

283
00:28:08,772 --> 00:28:09,773
Well, well.

284
00:28:10,732 --> 00:28:13,944
You feel like talking?
Where's your fuckin, brother?

285
00:28:14,736 --> 00:28:17,614
Doing your mother like a whore, you bitch!

286
00:28:18,490 --> 00:28:23,245
Nice. I wonder
how many steaks I could carve out of you.

287
00:28:23,745 --> 00:28:25,289
You died, motherfucker!

288
00:28:40,637 --> 00:28:42,806
Yeah, wanna fuck with me, ese?

289
00:28:43,015 --> 00:28:46,018
What, you rolling pin mighty good?

290
00:28:46,351 --> 00:28:49,688
What the hell you think you doing, huh?

291
00:28:52,149 --> 00:28:55,027
What,
you want to dance with me, motherfucker?

292
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:59,823
I'll fuck you up!
Come on!

293
00:29:13,670 --> 00:29:16,965
Jesus!
Nothing's easy.

294
00:29:20,177 --> 00:29:21,553
Wanna hold hands?

295
00:29:41,365 --> 00:29:43,826
<i>Hey, talk to me, bro.
- Hey, Ricky.</i>

296
00:29:44,159 --> 00:29:46,578
<i>You in the mood for sucking me off?</i>

297
00:29:46,745 --> 00:29:50,040
<i>Maybe let me lick your ass or something?</i>

298
00:29:50,207 --> 00:29:52,918
<i>Who is this?
Shit! Chelios?</i>

299
00:29:53,085 --> 00:29:56,088
<i>Is this fucking Chelios?
- That's right, bro.</i>

300
00:29:56,213 --> 00:30:00,717
<i>Guess how I got your brother's phone.
I'm sure you have it all figured out.</i>

301
00:30:00,884 --> 00:30:05,889
Looks like you should've
cut me up when you had the chance.

302
00:30:07,015 --> 00:30:13,188
I'm having a little trouble hearing you.
You experiencing a little 20/20 hindsight?

303
00:30:13,522 --> 00:30:15,691
You're supposed to be fucking dead!

304
00:30:15,858 --> 00:30:20,237
<i>You know, I kind of like that shit you put in
me. Gonna give me some more?</i>

305
00:30:20,696 --> 00:30:24,616
Well, I'm... I'm...
- I know, I know. Hey...

306
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:26,535
What's this?

307
00:30:30,706 --> 00:30:34,960
A necklace! You guys
really are faggots, aren't you?

308
00:30:35,127 --> 00:30:40,757
You motherfucker! My grandfather gave
that medallion to my father and then he...

309
00:30:40,924 --> 00:30:42,301
Fuck!

310
00:30:43,468 --> 00:30:48,473
Fuck you, man! Shove that thing up your ass!
- No thanks.

311
00:30:48,932 --> 00:30:54,438
You know, I believe I'll hang on to it.
You'll have to come find me, after all.

312
00:30:55,314 --> 00:30:59,276
Fucked up that you killed your own brother.
- You...

313
00:31:04,114 --> 00:31:08,785
What's that shit?
Epi... 10 milligrams?

314
00:31:09,286 --> 00:31:10,746
Good work, Kaylo.

315
00:31:32,142 --> 00:31:35,145
<i>Doctor Sing to the labor room.</i>

316
00:31:35,312 --> 00:31:38,357
<i>Doctor Sing to the labor room.</i>

317
00:31:42,444 --> 00:31:45,697
Asshole!
- No need to push.

318
00:31:45,989 --> 00:31:50,160
I'm looking for
something that starts with "E".

319
00:31:50,327 --> 00:31:51,453
England?

320
00:31:52,329 --> 00:31:55,666
Very funny. No.
Some kind of artificial adrenaline.

321
00:31:58,001 --> 00:32:02,172
Artificial adrenaline?
- Yeah, I've got heart problems.

322
00:32:03,048 --> 00:32:06,218
Epinephrine.
- Yes! Epinephrine.

323
00:32:06,385 --> 00:32:08,720
I love you. Epinephrine.

324
00:32:09,346 --> 00:32:12,516
I can't give you epinephrine.
- Why?

325
00:32:13,308 --> 00:32:15,018
Just a minute.

326
00:32:16,061 --> 00:32:17,896
Oi! What do you mean...

327
00:32:18,021 --> 00:32:20,065
What is this shit?
- Nasal spray.

328
00:32:20,232 --> 00:32:22,150
Miserable bitch!
What?

329
00:32:22,359 --> 00:32:27,739
Nasal spray. It's got epinephrine in it.
It'll get you tweaked, man.

330
00:32:40,711 --> 00:32:42,087
Hey!

331
00:32:48,760 --> 00:32:51,763
Sure that's the guy?
- Yeah.

332
00:33:56,078 --> 00:33:58,997
This room's clear.

333
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:27,442
<i>Could anyone
speaking Korean please come to ER?</i>

334
00:34:27,609 --> 00:34:29,528
<i>Anyone speaking Korean...</i>

335
00:34:35,617 --> 00:34:37,828
Yo, yo, yo!

336
00:34:37,995 --> 00:34:39,705
Yo!

337
00:34:39,872 --> 00:34:41,165
Stop!

338
00:34:43,167 --> 00:34:45,335
Stop!

339
00:34:46,211 --> 00:34:47,337
Jerk-off!

340
00:34:56,221 --> 00:34:58,307
Coming through!

341
00:35:00,684 --> 00:35:04,354
I know you motherfuckers have epinephrine.

342
00:35:07,024 --> 00:35:10,194
Clear the hallway!
- Corner. Is the OR ready?

343
00:35:12,154 --> 00:35:16,241
I'm having a bad day.
Tell me you've got epinephrine on this cart!

344
00:35:16,825 --> 00:35:18,243
You all right?

345
00:35:18,494 --> 00:35:20,329
Tell me you've got epinephrine!

346
00:35:20,496 --> 00:35:22,998
Motherfucker!
- I don't know. I'll check.

347
00:35:23,707 --> 00:35:25,417
Get back!
- Take it easy!

348
00:35:25,584 --> 00:35:30,589
Do you understand fucking English?
- Yes, I just don't know which draw it's in.

349
00:35:30,756 --> 00:35:31,840
Look!

350
00:35:32,049 --> 00:35:36,345
Give me the fucking epinephrine!
- I don't know where it is, man!

351
00:35:36,512 --> 00:35:39,723
What is this, a rest home?
- What are you doing back there?

352
00:35:39,890 --> 00:35:41,266
Hurry up!

353
00:35:41,433 --> 00:35:44,186
Get back!
- We can't treat without insurance.

354
00:35:44,394 --> 00:35:48,941
I don't know if I have it. Give me a second!
- Put the weapon down!

355
00:35:49,107 --> 00:35:51,610
What the fuck!
Where the fuck is it?

356
00:35:52,736 --> 00:35:55,280
My heart!
- What?

357
00:35:55,447 --> 00:35:57,616
My heart!
- Yeah, yeah.

358
00:35:57,783 --> 00:36:00,536
Drop your weapon, now!

359
00:36:02,955 --> 00:36:06,375
What do you think you're doing? This is...
- Shut up! You!

360
00:36:06,542 --> 00:36:09,628
Gimme the epinephrine?

361
00:36:11,755 --> 00:36:14,424
Don't even think about it!

362
00:36:14,633 --> 00:36:19,596
Albuterol... Flortab... Epinephrine!
Here it is! I've got it!

363
00:36:21,431 --> 00:36:23,100
Here you go.
- Gimme that.

364
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:26,103
Asshole.
- I'm not gonna tell you again.

365
00:36:26,270 --> 00:36:28,772
...all right? Just be quiet.

366
00:36:29,064 --> 00:36:31,984
Juice me.

367
00:36:32,109 --> 00:36:34,945
Juice?

368
00:36:35,112 --> 00:36:36,780
Do it.

369
00:36:36,947 --> 00:36:38,157
All right.
- Come on!

370
00:36:39,449 --> 00:36:41,493
I haven't got all day.

371
00:36:42,119 --> 00:36:46,248
Okay, I need both of them to...
Give them to me.

372
00:36:49,501 --> 00:36:50,669
One.

373
00:36:51,295 --> 00:36:53,505
Two. Clear!

374
00:36:57,009 --> 00:36:58,427
Get the fuck back!

375
00:37:00,679 --> 00:37:02,181
Get out!

376
00:37:51,730 --> 00:37:55,359
How much of this stuff did he say to take?

377
00:38:48,537 --> 00:38:50,622
<i>Chevy, we're in the air, man.</i>

378
00:38:51,039 --> 00:38:52,791
<i>Did you get the stuff?
- Got it.</i>

379
00:38:52,958 --> 00:38:54,418
Did you take it?
- Yup.

380
00:38:54,585 --> 00:38:56,545
<i>You took the whole thing.
- Yup.</i>

381
00:38:56,712 --> 00:38:59,923
I said one 5th. The shit's gonna kill you.
- Right.

382
00:39:00,090 --> 00:39:01,550
<i>Chest on fire?
- Check.</i>

383
00:39:01,717 --> 00:39:03,093
<i>But you're cold.
- Check.</i>

384
00:39:03,260 --> 00:39:07,431
And you've got a steel hard on, don't you?
- Let me check.

385
00:39:08,056 --> 00:39:10,601
Check.
- Your blood vessels are stimulated.

386
00:39:10,767 --> 00:39:14,730
Urinary sphincter's so tight,
you couldn't piss to save your life.

387
00:39:14,897 --> 00:39:16,398
Urinary sphincter, check!

388
00:39:17,608 --> 00:39:20,611
<i>Get some Vicodin. You at the hospital?
- Negative.</i>

389
00:39:20,777 --> 00:39:25,782
<i>Get some grass. That shit'll be out of
your system in 30 minutes, or it'll kill you.</i>

390
00:39:26,116 --> 00:39:30,329
This is costing me a fortune.
I'll call you in 20 minutes when we land.

391
00:39:30,496 --> 00:39:31,955
<i>Copy.
- Hey, Chevy?</i>

392
00:39:32,289 --> 00:39:36,126
You're a good dude.
Been nice knowing you.

393
00:39:36,418 --> 00:39:37,586
Copy, out.

394
00:39:39,004 --> 00:39:40,839
Some medical emergency.

395
00:39:42,299 --> 00:39:46,428
<i>Police have declined to name
the man they say is still at large,</i>

396
00:39:46,595 --> 00:39:49,264
<i>on a citywide rampage
that has left one man dead,</i>

397
00:39:49,473 --> 00:39:53,769
<i>dozens injured, and hundreds
of thousands of dollars of damage...</i>

398
00:39:53,936 --> 00:39:58,482
<i>in it's smoking, bloody wake.
The suspect is a professional killer...</i>

399
00:39:58,649 --> 00:40:01,652
<i>with ties to organized crime
and a long police record.</i>

400
00:40:02,027 --> 00:40:04,947
<i>He is considered armed and highly dangerous.</i>

401
00:40:05,113 --> 00:40:08,826
<i>We now continue with regularly
scheduled programming,</i>

402
00:40:08,992 --> 00:40:13,997
<i>but stay tuned for continuing coverage
of this bizarre story, as it unfolds.</i>

403
00:40:14,456 --> 00:40:19,044
<i>What your saying is that next to olives,
onions, lemons and limes...</i>

404
00:40:34,309 --> 00:40:37,229
Oh, shit!
Take it easy.

405
00:40:37,354 --> 00:40:38,856
Get back, pig!

406
00:40:39,189 --> 00:40:41,483
I... just give me the...

407
00:40:41,650 --> 00:40:44,069
Come on, then.
Let's see you run, piggy.

408
00:40:44,236 --> 00:40:45,529
Come on, piggy.

409
00:40:46,155 --> 00:40:48,699
Give me the gun.
Let's talk this over.

410
00:40:48,866 --> 00:40:53,078
Yeah, you want it?
There.

411
00:42:24,962 --> 00:42:28,340
Honey, let's go. Come on.
- Be careful.

412
00:42:30,634 --> 00:42:34,304
All right.
I'm gonna get some help, all right?

413
00:42:35,514 --> 00:42:36,807
<i>Yeah.</i>

414
00:42:36,974 --> 00:42:40,811
<i>Hey, did you try to call?
- You've been home all day?</i>

415
00:42:42,521 --> 00:42:47,151
I was sleeping in.
- Sleeping in. That's great, Eve.

416
00:42:47,317 --> 00:42:48,986
Super great.

417
00:42:49,153 --> 00:42:52,156
<i>You all rested, now?
Glad to hear it.</i>

418
00:42:53,115 --> 00:42:56,285
Listen, I've been fatally poisoned.

419
00:42:56,451 --> 00:42:59,621
A psychopath's on his way over
to torture and kill you,

420
00:42:59,788 --> 00:43:04,668
but don't get out of bed, I'll be
over in a flash. Could you fry up a waffle?

421
00:43:04,835 --> 00:43:10,340
Sure, yeah. Come on over. I'll be here.
- Right, you'll be there. Okay.

422
00:43:10,966 --> 00:43:12,009
Bye.

423
00:44:08,065 --> 00:44:09,775
So, let's go get the bitch!

424
00:44:24,081 --> 00:44:26,124
I hate you.

425
00:44:31,755 --> 00:44:33,799
Second.

426
00:44:34,925 --> 00:44:36,927
Come on!

427
00:44:37,094 --> 00:44:40,889
Come on, please!

428
00:44:42,266 --> 00:44:46,144
All right, all right. Jesus!

429
00:44:47,604 --> 00:44:49,565
Oh my God!

430
00:44:53,110 --> 00:44:56,488
Is this your new look or something?
- Yeah, you into it?

431
00:44:56,905 --> 00:44:58,157
It's gross.

432
00:45:01,577 --> 00:45:04,830
Are you looking for my other boyfriend?

433
00:45:05,497 --> 00:45:06,748
Yes!

434
00:45:08,333 --> 00:45:12,296
You haven't watched TV today, right?
- No, why?

435
00:45:12,462 --> 00:45:16,008
Didn't think so. Come on, we're leaving.
- Don't be a freak.

436
00:45:16,175 --> 00:45:17,676
Get dressed.

437
00:45:17,843 --> 00:45:22,306
Actually, can you change the clock on the
microwave? I never changed it back.

438
00:45:22,472 --> 00:45:24,766
What?
- The microwave.

439
00:45:24,975 --> 00:45:29,479
Change the clock. The daylight
savings time, I never changed it back.

440
00:45:29,646 --> 00:45:32,483
The microwave?
- Yes.

441
00:45:32,649 --> 00:45:36,820
Listen, I bought you some flowers.
They got fucked up on the way over.

442
00:45:36,987 --> 00:45:41,700
That's sweet! You okay?
You look like you're on drugs or something.

443
00:45:42,826 --> 00:45:44,828
You love me, yeah?

444
00:45:46,163 --> 00:45:48,457
Yes.

445
00:45:48,624 --> 00:45:52,503
Then I need you to do something for me.
- What? What's wrong?

446
00:45:52,669 --> 00:45:58,008
I need you to put some clothes on
and come with me, right now.

447
00:45:58,175 --> 00:46:01,178
No.
- I'll change the clock on the microwave.

448
00:46:01,345 --> 00:46:03,514
Okay. All right.

449
00:46:22,324 --> 00:46:24,201
Shit's wearing off.

450
00:46:25,035 --> 00:46:29,832
The waffle iron's on if you want to make one.
- Great.

451
00:46:31,375 --> 00:46:33,210
Great.

452
00:46:55,607 --> 00:46:58,277
You're so stressed out.
Want some pot?

453
00:46:59,236 --> 00:47:01,071
Yeah! No!

454
00:47:03,574 --> 00:47:06,076
Ready! What's wrong?
- I burned my hand.

455
00:47:06,243 --> 00:47:10,873
Oh, my God! Let me see it!
- Don't worry about it. Hey!

456
00:47:11,456 --> 00:47:13,458
What the...

457
00:47:13,917 --> 00:47:17,546
I'm sorry.
- That was completely uncalled for.

458
00:47:19,798 --> 00:47:20,799
Can we just...

459
00:47:20,841 --> 00:47:21,842
Fine.

460
00:47:33,687 --> 00:47:36,482
Parked out the back.
- Oh.

461
00:47:37,316 --> 00:47:40,360
Darn! That... thing.
- What thing?

462
00:47:40,527 --> 00:47:43,363
The waffle thing.
I gotta turn it off.

463
00:47:58,504 --> 00:47:59,713
Hello?

464
00:48:00,714 --> 00:48:02,341
Hello?

465
00:48:08,222 --> 00:48:10,182
<i>All right, very funny.</i>

466
00:48:13,018 --> 00:48:14,520
God, I hate that.

467
00:48:17,523 --> 00:48:20,400
Do you want to burn the building down?

468
00:48:29,201 --> 00:48:31,328
Ouch!
- Sorry, honey.

469
00:48:31,745 --> 00:48:34,164
Nice one. Chev?

470
00:48:34,331 --> 00:48:36,917
Oh, there's my Tiger Balm.

471
00:48:38,085 --> 00:48:39,545
I swear to God, Chev.

472
00:48:40,671 --> 00:48:44,007
I don't know what you're on,
but it isn't working for you.

473
00:48:48,178 --> 00:48:51,014
My hand cream!
That's where you went.

474
00:49:00,023 --> 00:49:02,901
Chev? Can I have some help, here?

475
00:49:07,614 --> 00:49:11,785
Where's your car?
- Actually, I took a cab.

476
00:49:41,607 --> 00:49:43,567
You're embarrassing me.

477
00:49:43,984 --> 00:49:47,070
I didn't have
a lot of time to pick this out.

478
00:49:51,283 --> 00:49:53,785
So, why are we here?

479
00:50:11,303 --> 00:50:15,599
This isn't gonna be...
This isn't gonna be easy, as they say.

480
00:50:18,685 --> 00:50:19,978
Oh, fucker.

481
00:50:20,145 --> 00:50:23,649
All right, here it is.
- Sorry.

482
00:50:28,445 --> 00:50:31,782
I told you I was a video game programmer.
- Yeah?

483
00:50:31,949 --> 00:50:34,201
That was a lie.

484
00:50:34,326 --> 00:50:36,203
Actually...

485
00:50:38,997 --> 00:50:40,874
I kill people.

486
00:50:41,542 --> 00:50:46,171
Professional hitman. I freelance
for a major West Coast crime syndicate.

487
00:50:46,672 --> 00:50:50,551
Last night was a job like 100 others.
High dollar hit, nothing special.

488
00:50:51,885 --> 00:50:56,056
<i>The Triads, from Hong Kong,
had been moving in on the local drug cartels.</i>

489
00:50:56,807 --> 00:51:01,061
<i>My target was
the number 1 man in Los Angeles, Don Kim.</i>

490
00:51:09,903 --> 00:51:11,738
Well?

491
00:51:12,364 --> 00:51:14,575
What are you waiting for?

492
00:51:15,159 --> 00:51:22,332
<i>Then, this insane idea comes through the back
of my head, like a.45 slug at close range.</i>

493
00:51:24,251 --> 00:51:26,753
Congratulations.

494
00:51:27,421 --> 00:51:31,383
Did I win something?
- Your life, jackass.

495
00:51:33,010 --> 00:51:37,097
100 grand wants you dead.
So, sooner or later it's gonna happen,

496
00:51:37,264 --> 00:51:39,766
but I'm not doing it.

497
00:51:40,392 --> 00:51:42,269
I see.

498
00:51:42,895 --> 00:51:47,900
Instead you're gonna do something for me.
You're gonna get out of town. Disappear.

499
00:51:48,066 --> 00:51:51,361
I don't care where you go or what you do,

500
00:51:51,528 --> 00:51:56,450
so long as you're invisible for 48 hours.
That's all I ask.

501
00:51:56,909 --> 00:51:59,119
48 hours?

502
00:52:00,537 --> 00:52:03,081
Or, if you prefer,
we can do it the other way.

503
00:52:04,750 --> 00:52:08,587
The way where I go to work,
and you meet Buddha.

504
00:52:23,393 --> 00:52:26,313
You see?
I quit.

505
00:52:26,438 --> 00:52:29,650
I quit the business, for you.

506
00:52:31,568 --> 00:52:34,112
For me?
- Yeah.

507
00:52:34,279 --> 00:52:37,658
I figure I call you that night
and tell you everything.

508
00:52:37,825 --> 00:52:40,994
We get on a plane,
leave this shit, never come back.

509
00:52:41,912 --> 00:52:45,582
Pretty crazy, huh?
- You are so weird.

510
00:52:47,668 --> 00:52:51,004
Are we going on a trip?
- Well...

511
00:52:52,464 --> 00:52:56,927
I might be going on a trip,
but you're not coming with me...

512
00:52:57,344 --> 00:53:00,681
Please! Wait, please!
- Mob hits, Chev?

513
00:53:00,806 --> 00:53:04,685
Chinese poison?
Do you know how ridiculous you sound?

514
00:53:04,810 --> 00:53:07,437
If you're leaving me,
then tell me the truth!

515
00:53:07,771 --> 00:53:10,023
Oh, right.
You think it sounds crazy.

516
00:53:10,190 --> 00:53:13,819
How do you think I feel?
I have to live this shit!

517
00:53:15,320 --> 00:53:17,823
Chev? Chev?

518
00:53:20,159 --> 00:53:21,660
What's wrong?

519
00:53:24,329 --> 00:53:26,999
Wait a minute, you trust me?
- No.

520
00:53:27,666 --> 00:53:30,169
Make love to me.
- What?

521
00:53:30,669 --> 00:53:34,673
I think it'll help.
- What? Are you kidding? Get off me!

522
00:53:34,840 --> 00:53:38,969
Take your clothes off.
- No!

523
00:53:39,344 --> 00:53:40,345
No!

524
00:53:40,846 --> 00:53:44,308
You said you wanted to be more spontaneous.
- You're crazy!

525
00:53:44,474 --> 00:53:47,311
You're an adrenaline junkie with no soul!

526
00:53:47,811 --> 00:53:50,898
Save me, Eve. Save my life!
- Stop it!

527
00:53:54,568 --> 00:53:58,822
I'm sorry.
Oh my God, are you okay?

528
00:53:58,989 --> 00:54:00,699
Are you okay?

529
00:54:05,370 --> 00:54:07,831
No! No!

530
00:54:09,208 --> 00:54:10,250
Shit!

531
00:54:13,003 --> 00:54:15,506
Get off!

532
00:54:25,599 --> 00:54:27,684
You filthy animal!

533
00:54:28,393 --> 00:54:32,064
Take me right here, in front of everyone!

534
00:54:32,272 --> 00:54:35,400
That's it!

535
00:54:35,567 --> 00:54:37,569
Come on! Do it!

536
00:54:37,736 --> 00:54:39,696
What are you waiting for?
- Jesus!

537
00:54:39,863 --> 00:54:41,615
Come on!
- I'm trying!

538
00:54:43,534 --> 00:54:47,037
Oh, God!
Now you can't get it up?

539
00:54:47,746 --> 00:54:50,958
Come on, get it up!
- I'll fucking get it up!

540
00:54:59,424 --> 00:55:01,552
Goddamnit, Chev!
- Shut up!

541
00:55:15,232 --> 00:55:17,234
I'm alive! I'm alive!

542
00:55:17,442 --> 00:55:19,945
I'm alive, you motherfuckers!

543
00:55:21,113 --> 00:55:24,116
Oh, my God! Wow!

544
00:55:27,828 --> 00:55:31,832
Oh, my God! Yes!

545
00:55:34,126 --> 00:55:36,962
Yeah?
- What are you doing?

546
00:55:37,462 --> 00:55:39,923
<i>I've got Verona.
- Kaylo?</i>

547
00:55:40,465 --> 00:55:42,843
<i>I've got Verona, man.</i>

548
00:55:44,761 --> 00:55:47,181
What?
- No shit?

549
00:55:47,514 --> 00:55:51,018
<i>Where are you?
- Don Kim's shirt factory, upstairs.</i>

550
00:55:51,185 --> 00:55:55,105
What's the matter with you?
- 5th and Alameda?

551
00:55:55,856 --> 00:56:00,819
Who's at 5th and Alameda?
- Don't let that fucker out of your sight!

552
00:56:00,986 --> 00:56:05,449
Hear me? With you in 10 minutes. You got it?
- Yeah, Chev.

553
00:56:06,492 --> 00:56:09,495
Honey, I gotta go.
Please understand.

554
00:56:09,828 --> 00:56:12,831
No, Chev, I do not understand!

555
00:56:13,207 --> 00:56:15,334
Oh, baby!

556
00:56:16,335 --> 00:56:17,794
I'll call you!

557
00:56:20,964 --> 00:56:22,549
What are you looking at?

558
00:56:35,145 --> 00:56:38,524
Hey man, what's the matter with you?
You a crackhead?

559
00:56:39,024 --> 00:56:44,738
Right, just step on it, all right?
- You're won't die in my cab, crackhead.

560
00:56:45,030 --> 00:56:46,740
I got something for you.

561
00:56:51,662 --> 00:56:53,247
Take this Haitian shit.

562
00:56:53,539 --> 00:56:58,168
This shit is some hardcore shit.
It's made from plant shit.

563
00:57:01,588 --> 00:57:06,009
Hey, what are you laughing at?
Look at this. You see that?

564
00:57:06,260 --> 00:57:09,555
That's what a man look like, crackhead.
That's power.

565
00:57:10,889 --> 00:57:13,433
Now look at you.

566
00:57:16,562 --> 00:57:19,565
What the hell.

567
00:57:28,866 --> 00:57:30,909
Yeah.

568
00:57:31,743 --> 00:57:35,956
It tastes like ass.

569
00:57:37,040 --> 00:57:40,043
That's right, devil. You wait.

570
00:58:14,745 --> 00:58:16,747
Shut the fuck up!
- No!

571
00:58:16,955 --> 00:58:19,249
No!
- Shut the fuck up!

572
00:58:27,674 --> 00:58:30,928
Whoop, there it is!
Fuck him!

573
00:58:37,643 --> 00:58:38,852
We're here.

574
00:58:45,150 --> 00:58:49,822
What'd you say was in this stuff?
- I told you, it's hardcore.

575
00:58:55,869 --> 00:58:59,206
It'll be $5.55.

576
00:59:01,375 --> 00:59:06,213
It's all you, man.
- Have a nice day, devil.

577
00:59:12,052 --> 00:59:13,554
This is fucked.

578
00:59:16,014 --> 00:59:17,224
Where's he going?

579
00:59:22,479 --> 00:59:27,234
Yeah, okay. How the fuck you
going to call me, talking shit?

580
00:59:27,359 --> 00:59:31,363
I'm gonna smack the hell out of you.
I don't know where he at...

581
00:59:31,530 --> 00:59:34,074
Fucking call me talking shit!

582
00:59:36,994 --> 00:59:39,746
I'm doing my job.
I'm doing my shit.

583
00:59:41,874 --> 00:59:44,918
I'm out here,
doing what I do. I'm a rooftop mother...

584
00:59:45,711 --> 00:59:47,713
Hey, Chevy!
What's up, dog?

585
00:59:47,880 --> 00:59:50,215
Everything okay?
You chillin'? You good?

586
00:59:50,382 --> 00:59:53,051
What a coincidence!
- What do you mean?

587
00:59:53,218 --> 00:59:57,222
What, you waiting for a bus?
- Actually, I thought a helicopter...

588
00:59:57,389 --> 00:59:58,891
What is this?
- What?

589
00:59:59,057 --> 01:00:01,435
You working for the Chinese?
- The Chinese?

590
01:00:01,602 --> 01:00:05,731
You crazy? I wouldn't do that to you.
- I am crazy. Where's Kaylo?

591
01:00:07,274 --> 01:00:10,277
Okay, ding. Time's up.
- What do you mean, "ding"?

592
01:00:10,402 --> 01:00:12,946
What do you mean, "ding"?

593
01:00:18,744 --> 01:00:20,746
Where is that motherfucker?

594
01:00:20,913 --> 01:00:22,581
Chev.

595
01:00:24,583 --> 01:00:28,462
What the fuck is this?
- Chev, baby. Take it easy.

596
01:00:29,755 --> 01:00:31,590
Oh, you mean like this?

597
01:00:33,759 --> 01:00:38,472
Now you tell me where that
little toe-rag motherfucker is. Verona.

598
01:00:38,889 --> 01:00:41,308
Verona's got nothing to do with this.

599
01:00:42,726 --> 01:00:43,977
What?

600
01:00:44,728 --> 01:00:48,816
Don Carlos wants you off the streets.
- Carlito?

601
01:00:49,107 --> 01:00:52,110
You've totally lost your shit, dog.

602
01:00:52,277 --> 01:00:56,406
You're all over TV. Destroying property,
making unauthorized hits...

603
01:00:56,990 --> 01:01:01,745
You're causing the organization
a great deal of embarrassment.

604
01:01:01,912 --> 01:01:04,748
You're telling me Carlito wanted this?
- Look,

605
01:01:04,998 --> 01:01:07,668
don't worry,
we'll take care of Verona.

606
01:01:07,793 --> 01:01:13,006
The best thing for you to do
is find some nice, dark, quiet place and...

607
01:01:13,632 --> 01:01:14,842
just die.

608
01:01:21,974 --> 01:01:26,353
Just die. You think
I've got "cunt" written on my forehead?

609
01:01:35,320 --> 01:01:36,613
Maybe you're right.

610
01:01:37,823 --> 01:01:41,618
We all got to die sometime, right?
- Yeah.

611
01:01:42,327 --> 01:01:45,038
We all got to die sometime.

612
01:01:45,289 --> 01:01:48,125
So, I'll just die.

613
01:01:52,379 --> 01:01:54,214
What the...

614
01:02:20,908 --> 01:02:23,744
Of all the fuckin'...
- You got shot!

615
01:02:23,994 --> 01:02:25,245
Mother...

616
01:02:26,205 --> 01:02:28,749
Jesus!
Eve, move!

617
01:02:44,890 --> 01:02:47,601
You, asshole!
- Don't talk to him like that!

618
01:02:47,726 --> 01:02:50,854
My boyfriend kills people!
- Nice.

619
01:04:19,485 --> 01:04:21,528
Oh, God!

620
01:04:22,821 --> 01:04:26,533
I had to see if you were telling the truth.

621
01:04:29,328 --> 01:04:31,038
Come on.

622
01:04:31,788 --> 01:04:33,540
No, wait!

623
01:04:39,505 --> 01:04:40,714
Now, come on.

624
01:04:43,300 --> 01:04:45,469
Oh, God!

625
01:04:48,055 --> 01:04:49,306
Oh, dammit!

626
01:04:49,640 --> 01:04:52,976
I forgot to take my birth control pills.
- What?

627
01:04:53,685 --> 01:04:57,147
Where are the keys? The keys!
- Here.

628
01:05:01,985 --> 01:05:03,654
Come! Come!
- My stuff!

629
01:05:05,739 --> 01:05:07,324
All my stuff!

630
01:05:36,854 --> 01:05:39,273
You weren't lying!
- Welcome to my life.

631
01:05:41,233 --> 01:05:45,028
No, I mean...
that you would give it all up for me.

632
01:05:45,863 --> 01:05:47,197
Yeah.

633
01:05:48,907 --> 01:05:51,869
And the other part?
- The poison's true, too.

634
01:05:53,120 --> 01:05:56,081
Then... that means...

635
01:05:56,456 --> 01:05:58,041
Pretty much, Eve.

636
01:06:01,920 --> 01:06:05,591
How can we stop it?
- Only adrenaline can slow it down.

637
01:06:08,886 --> 01:06:12,556
So, when we were in Chinatown?
- Yeah. Sorry.

638
01:06:16,935 --> 01:06:18,270
What are you doing?

639
01:06:18,437 --> 01:06:20,814
This'll get you going.
- What?

640
01:06:20,981 --> 01:06:24,943
Come on, let's finish what you started.
- Oh, boy.

641
01:06:27,112 --> 01:06:30,115
Oh, that's it.
That's really working for me.

642
01:06:32,743 --> 01:06:36,121
You like that?
- Stay down!

643
01:06:40,792 --> 01:06:41,960
Motherfuck!

644
01:06:45,464 --> 01:06:48,967
Jesus! Yeah, that's it, baby.
Just a little more.

645
01:06:53,305 --> 01:06:56,016
Stay down, Eve.

646
01:07:04,358 --> 01:07:07,361
Jesus.
- Oh, you're so big!

647
01:07:08,445 --> 01:07:10,197
Oh my God!

648
01:07:14,535 --> 01:07:16,453
Just a touch...

649
01:07:18,163 --> 01:07:21,792
What's that matter?
- So you can fall asleep like always?

650
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:25,128
I don't think so.

651
01:07:25,462 --> 01:07:26,880
Jesus! Fuck!

652
01:08:09,256 --> 01:08:11,341
Are they really...

653
01:08:11,508 --> 01:08:14,052
They're dead.

654
01:08:14,553 --> 01:08:17,556
How do you...
How can you do that?

655
01:08:19,558 --> 01:08:22,561
I told you, baby. I quit.

656
01:08:28,567 --> 01:08:31,361
Where are you going?
- Stay there, honey.

657
01:08:33,739 --> 01:08:36,241
Jesus! Fuck!
- Chev!

658
01:08:37,910 --> 01:08:40,037
Asshole!

659
01:09:11,276 --> 01:09:13,111
I can't feel my leg.

660
01:09:22,913 --> 01:09:26,124
Shit!
I've been trying to call you for a half hour.

661
01:09:26,291 --> 01:09:28,794
<i>Where the fuck have you been?
- In my office.</i>

662
01:09:28,961 --> 01:09:31,922
<i>Can you make it over here?
- Sure, why not?</i>

663
01:09:36,635 --> 01:09:41,473
Chocolate, what's this fucking receipt
from Gold Foods Market for $254?

664
01:09:43,142 --> 01:09:44,601
Snacks.

665
01:09:58,991 --> 01:10:00,993
I hate television.

666
01:10:01,160 --> 01:10:02,995
I owe you again, Doc.

667
01:10:03,162 --> 01:10:07,040
Chevy, you're my best customer.

668
01:10:08,167 --> 01:10:11,545
What is this stuff?
- Synthetic epinephrine...

669
01:10:11,670 --> 01:10:15,883
diluted with some saline.
- Feels sort of good.

670
01:10:16,967 --> 01:10:21,388
Well, I got a little meth in there, too.
You're feeling the endorphins.

671
01:10:25,309 --> 01:10:27,227
Wait a minute.
I'm not better?

672
01:10:28,520 --> 01:10:30,063
No, you're not better.

673
01:10:30,230 --> 01:10:35,861
You're in such shit shape, it's stunning.
I can't believe your heart's beating.

674
01:10:36,028 --> 01:10:39,239
You should be in a fucking medical journal.

675
01:10:45,037 --> 01:10:50,083
So, what are you going to do?
- The solution acts as a competing inhibitor.

676
01:10:50,334 --> 01:10:53,086
It's pushing
the poison out of your receptors,

677
01:10:53,212 --> 01:10:56,715
and replacing it with a chemical.
It's just a temporary fix.

678
01:10:56,882 --> 01:10:58,050
Then what?

679
01:10:58,217 --> 01:11:01,053
Then you're fucked.

680
01:11:03,055 --> 01:11:07,559
I can put you on life support
and string this out for a few days.

681
01:11:07,726 --> 01:11:11,396
But you're going to
go into a comma at some point.

682
01:11:11,563 --> 01:11:13,440
Does she know?

683
01:11:17,236 --> 01:11:22,407
Why don't I load you up with something,
and you can go out in a beautiful dream.

684
01:11:24,535 --> 01:11:26,411
A dream.

685
01:11:28,080 --> 01:11:31,458
Can I do that for you?

686
01:11:33,043 --> 01:11:37,422
No, no, no.
That's not what I want.

687
01:11:38,257 --> 01:11:39,800
What do you want?

688
01:11:40,926 --> 01:11:42,761
One hour.

689
01:11:45,430 --> 01:11:48,142
I want one hour.

690
01:11:57,151 --> 01:11:58,819
Give me a fuckin, break.

691
01:12:02,281 --> 01:12:09,329
<i>So, the wild rampage that began 9am in
L.A. Continues. The suspect, still at large.</i>

692
01:12:10,956 --> 01:12:13,667
We didn't give him
enough of the Chinese shit.

693
01:12:14,626 --> 01:12:17,004
You think?

694
01:12:21,341 --> 01:12:23,510
Dude, it's him!

695
01:12:26,346 --> 01:12:29,433
<i>What's up, corpse?
- Bonjour, douche bag,</i>

696
01:12:29,600 --> 01:12:34,438
<i>Thought you might be interested in a deal.
- Oh, you a dealer, now?</i>

697
01:12:34,605 --> 01:12:36,690
Don't you worry about what I am.

698
01:12:37,024 --> 01:12:42,112
<i>Listen, I want the antidote.
- Oh, the antidote?</i>

699
01:12:42,279 --> 01:12:46,116
<i>That's right, the antidote.
- What you prepared to give me?</i>

700
01:12:46,283 --> 01:12:51,622
How about the jewelry I got off that
faggot brother of yours, you cocksucker?

701
01:12:52,206 --> 01:12:55,792
<i>Don't pop a blood vessel, you little penis.
- Okay.</i>

702
01:12:55,959 --> 01:12:57,878
<i>You like the deal?
- Whatever!</i>

703
01:12:58,003 --> 01:13:00,631
Be at the downtown Lint in 20 minutes.

704
01:13:00,839 --> 01:13:02,549
<i>You know the spot?
- Yeah.</i>

705
01:13:02,674 --> 01:13:06,553
<i>Don't be late, or I'll trade the
thing to a whore for a hand job.</i>

706
01:13:06,720 --> 01:13:10,140
Look, I said I said I'd fuckin, be...
Fuck!

707
01:13:10,849 --> 01:13:13,352
See you later, sunshine.
...turn that shit off.

708
01:13:13,519 --> 01:13:15,521
Dammit! Fuck!

709
01:13:21,360 --> 01:13:25,489
Yo, it's Verona.
You won't believe this call I just got.

710
01:13:40,712 --> 01:13:42,881
<i>It's gonna be all right, baby.</i>

711
01:13:43,048 --> 01:13:46,093
<i>But you said...
- No, no.</i>

712
01:13:46,260 --> 01:13:47,928
<i>Things have changed.</i>

713
01:13:48,095 --> 01:13:52,724
<i>There's an antidote. I can
make a deal for it, but I got to go alone.</i>

714
01:13:53,684 --> 01:13:56,728
<i>I'm scared.
- Of course.</i>

715
01:13:57,396 --> 01:14:00,107
<i>You'll be safe, now.
And I'll be back.</i>

716
01:14:01,233 --> 01:14:03,235
Promise?

717
01:14:04,027 --> 01:14:05,571
I promise.

718
01:15:14,181 --> 01:15:17,935
What's happening, bro?

719
01:15:37,704 --> 01:15:42,376
<i>Where did I go wrong?
- You fuckin, just say something?</i>

720
01:15:42,543 --> 01:15:44,795
<i>It's like talking to the wall.</i>

721
01:15:47,339 --> 01:15:51,134
<i>Mom?
- I'm amazed you remember you have a mother.</i>

722
01:15:51,301 --> 01:15:53,303
<i>You never call, you never write.</i>

723
01:15:54,012 --> 01:15:56,807
<i>I haven't seen you
since you ran out at 16.</i>

724
01:15:56,974 --> 01:16:01,061
Yeah, yeah. Right, Mom.
With you popping Valium like tic tacs,

725
01:16:01,228 --> 01:16:06,567
boning a new asshole every 2 weeks, why
wouldn't I stick around with fun like that?

726
01:16:08,694 --> 01:16:13,407
<i>Please, I haven't got time for this.
- You got no time, period.</i>

727
01:16:13,699 --> 01:16:17,202
<i>Orlando?
- You're a persistent motherfucker, Chelios.</i>

728
01:16:17,369 --> 01:16:19,997
<i>I give you that.
- This is weird.</i>

729
01:16:20,164 --> 01:16:24,209
<i>I know this is weird,
but this has got to stop sometimes...</i>

730
01:16:27,212 --> 01:16:29,339
<i>They pop you and you keep getting up?</i>

731
01:16:30,007 --> 01:16:34,553
<i>I'm the terminator.
- You was, but here's a new gun in town.</i>

732
01:16:35,554 --> 01:16:37,556
You know, I just don't get it.

733
01:16:37,723 --> 01:16:40,726
Why didn't you just cut me up
when you had the chance?

734
01:16:40,893 --> 01:16:43,228
<i>Too easy, motherfucker.
Look at you.</i>

735
01:16:43,437 --> 01:16:49,776
<i>Bi-polar, sadomasochistic tendencies...
- Adrenaline junkie, addicted to violence...</i>

736
01:16:50,569 --> 01:16:54,072
<i>Probably spends every day
of his life looking for the big rush.</i>

737
01:16:54,239 --> 01:17:00,120
<i>Carving up a guy, while he screams in
his own blood and excrement, would be like...</i>

738
01:17:00,245 --> 01:17:03,373
<i>like a gift.
A warriors death.</i>

739
01:17:05,250 --> 01:17:07,211
<i>Hell, you'd probably get off on it.</i>

740
01:17:08,378 --> 01:17:10,923
What, did you rehearse this?
- No, no.

741
01:17:11,757 --> 01:17:16,929
<i>This was the best way for a guy like you.
Slow ticking clock, winding down.</i>

742
01:17:17,429 --> 01:17:20,974
<i>Inevitable, non-negotiable, until...
- Who the hell are you?</i>

743
01:17:25,062 --> 01:17:28,649
<i>I think I'm starting to figure it out.
- Better late than never.</i>

744
01:17:29,316 --> 01:17:31,401
<i>You know you're gonna die up there.</i>

745
01:17:31,568 --> 01:17:35,906
Yeah, maybe.
But I'm taking you with me.

746
01:17:48,836 --> 01:17:50,462
Some pills, Doc.

747
01:18:06,645 --> 01:18:09,940
Chelios?
- Hello, girls.

748
01:18:17,698 --> 01:18:18,782
Hold up.

749
01:18:20,617 --> 01:18:23,495
Give me the piece.

750
01:18:42,639 --> 01:18:46,059
Now, isn't that a fucking picture?
- Chelios.

751
01:18:47,144 --> 01:18:49,146
What a fucking nightmare you are.

752
01:18:49,730 --> 01:18:50,814
No shit.

753
01:18:51,356 --> 01:18:52,524
Sit down.

754
01:18:53,859 --> 01:18:56,653
Whoa! Wait a minute.
You pat him down, again.

755
01:18:57,237 --> 01:18:59,239
I know he's carrying something.

756
01:19:03,202 --> 01:19:04,495
Let me see it.

757
01:19:07,998 --> 01:19:09,583
Motherfucker.

758
01:19:09,875 --> 01:19:12,669
Clever.
What is this, an insulin pump?

759
01:19:13,003 --> 01:19:14,046
Basically.

760
01:19:14,421 --> 01:19:16,089
What the fuck is insulin?

761
01:19:17,257 --> 01:19:18,425
Ephedrine, right?

762
01:19:19,051 --> 01:19:22,429
Yeah.
- You're very resourceful.

763
01:19:25,516 --> 01:19:28,852
Found a new master, little bitch?
- I'm nobody's bitch.

764
01:19:29,728 --> 01:19:33,899
You'll be a bitch when Carlito
hires you for half what he paid me.

765
01:19:34,066 --> 01:19:35,442
That's enough.

766
01:19:35,567 --> 01:19:39,446
You'll throw boss a reach-around,
show him you're a good bitch.

767
01:19:39,613 --> 01:19:42,032
I'm nobody's little bitch!

768
01:19:42,199 --> 01:19:44,034
You fuckin, hear me?

769
01:19:44,201 --> 01:19:46,912
He'll pay what I tell him to pay!
- Enough!

770
01:19:47,287 --> 01:19:48,622
Sit down!

771
01:19:53,418 --> 01:19:56,296
It's been a long fucking day.

772
01:19:56,463 --> 01:20:00,300
In the end, you have to admit,
it all works out quite nicely.

773
01:20:00,425 --> 01:20:03,804
Don Kim gets his bullet,
thanks to you,

774
01:20:03,971 --> 01:20:07,432
and Hong Kong gets a goat to take the fall.

775
01:20:08,559 --> 01:20:13,063
Please understand, it's nothing personal.
- Speak for yourself.

776
01:20:16,441 --> 01:20:17,943
That what I think it is?

777
01:20:20,237 --> 01:20:22,573
It's the Chinese shit.

778
01:20:22,948 --> 01:20:25,617
Hold him down.

779
01:20:27,786 --> 01:20:30,289
Not so fast, motherfucker!

780
01:20:31,456 --> 01:20:33,792
He's gone dipsy-do, yo!

781
01:20:36,295 --> 01:20:37,963
Whatever, psycho.

782
01:20:40,674 --> 01:20:44,428
I'm afraid the Houdini act is over,
my friend.

783
01:20:52,352 --> 01:20:54,480
Our Father, who art in...
- Shut up!

784
01:20:54,646 --> 01:20:57,691
So, this is how it is.

785
01:20:59,485 --> 01:21:03,530
It's Don Kim! He's supposed to be dead!
- Presto.

786
01:21:26,512 --> 01:21:29,723
<i>Police have moved
to surround the Hotel Lint,</i>

787
01:21:29,848 --> 01:21:32,518
<i>where the madman
behind today's mayhem...</i>

788
01:21:32,684 --> 01:21:36,063
<i>is holed up
and making a desperate last stand.</i>

789
01:21:36,563 --> 01:21:39,566
<i>Officials have confirmed
gunfire on the sundeck.</i>

790
01:21:39,733 --> 01:21:45,072
<i>Our news chopper will bring live,
uncensored coverage from above the hotel.</i>

791
01:21:45,864 --> 01:21:52,204
<i>Again, this coverage is uncensored, so any
small children present should leave the room.</i>

792
01:22:06,760 --> 01:22:08,387
Get me out of here, now!

793
01:22:17,729 --> 01:22:19,565
I'll kill you, Chelios!

794
01:22:20,190 --> 01:22:21,441
Too late!

795
01:22:28,198 --> 01:22:29,741
Look out!

796
01:22:30,784 --> 01:22:32,202
Thanks, boss.

797
01:23:52,825 --> 01:23:56,036
Let's get the fuck out of here, now!
Let's go!

798
01:24:02,334 --> 01:24:03,877
Present from Kaylo.

799
01:24:12,553 --> 01:24:14,513
Now what?
Now you say shit!

800
01:24:14,680 --> 01:24:16,181
Where the fuck were you?

801
01:24:17,391 --> 01:24:18,892
Who's the bitch, now?

802
01:24:26,233 --> 01:24:28,402
No, no! You fly, motherfucker!

803
01:24:30,028 --> 01:24:31,697
Motherfuckin, fly!

804
01:25:21,455 --> 01:25:22,539
You're dead!

805
01:25:24,041 --> 01:25:25,792
Oh my God!

806
01:25:39,389 --> 01:25:41,308
You're dead, motherfucker!

807
01:26:11,129 --> 01:26:14,341
I told you I'd kill you, you little bitch!

808
01:26:37,156 --> 01:26:40,325
<i>Hey, its Eve.
I'm glad you called but I'm not here.</i>

809
01:26:40,492 --> 01:26:45,122
<i>Leave a message, unless you're
selling something, cause I'm not interested.</i>

810
01:26:45,289 --> 01:26:49,209
<i>If you're not, then just...
Wait, time's up.</i>

811
01:26:49,835 --> 01:26:51,837
Hey, doll...

812
01:26:53,172 --> 01:26:56,800
Looks like I let you down, again.

813
01:26:57,468 --> 01:27:02,055
<i>Seems like all my life
I've just been going... going...</i>

814
01:27:02,848 --> 01:27:04,516
<i>going...</i>

815
01:27:04,975 --> 01:27:09,521
I wish I'd taken more time to
stop and smell the roses, so to speak.

816
01:27:11,648 --> 01:27:15,903
Well, I guess it's too late for that now.

817
01:27:19,531 --> 01:27:24,369
You're the greatest, baby.
