1
00:00:47,079 --> 00:00:50,449
<i>As you may well know, I am many things.</i>

2
00:00:50,549 --> 00:00:53,519
<i>An arts dealer, an accomplished fencer,</i>

3
00:00:53,619 --> 00:00:56,055
<i>fair shot with most weapons.</i>

4
00:00:56,155 --> 00:01:01,126
<i>I am loved and respected
by all who know me...</i>

5
00:01:01,226 --> 00:01:03,324
<i>slightly.</i>

6
00:01:06,665 --> 00:01:09,902
<i>But I have always felt
there's something missing, you see.</i>

7
00:01:10,002 --> 00:01:12,338
<i>Some final piece of my personal puzzle.</i>

8
00:01:12,438 --> 00:01:15,908
<i>I needed something bold, distinctive.</i>

9
00:01:16,008 --> 00:01:17,343
Thank you.

10
00:01:17,443 --> 00:01:21,614
The work of art with which
I could declare to the heavens,

11
00:01:21,714 --> 00:01:24,817
I am Lord Charlie Mortdecai,

12
00:01:24,917 --> 00:01:29,655
and this little bit of magic

13
00:01:29,755 --> 00:01:32,224
is my moustache.

14
00:01:35,961 --> 00:01:39,632
I see. Shall we to business then, Fang?

15
00:01:40,966 --> 00:01:43,035
Would you mind?

16
00:01:45,637 --> 00:01:48,164
"Find," you said.

17
00:01:49,007 --> 00:01:53,044
And find, I have done.

18
00:02:00,986 --> 00:02:03,322
The Qianlong vase.

19
00:02:04,790 --> 00:02:07,226
Very, very rare.

20
00:02:07,326 --> 00:02:09,962
Low-fired with an immersion glaze?

21
00:02:10,062 --> 00:02:12,831
None of the southern
Yangtze ceramics are low-fired.

22
00:02:12,931 --> 00:02:15,701
But you know that. You're testing me.

23
00:02:17,035 --> 00:02:20,506
I'm so terribly sorry.
Mosquito. You see it?

24
00:02:21,707 --> 00:02:23,942
Why don't you test the vase instead?

25
00:02:24,042 --> 00:02:27,913
I am sure that you will agree it is
a bargain at two million pounds.

26
00:02:28,013 --> 00:02:30,816
Everyone knows you're broke.

27
00:02:30,916 --> 00:02:33,919
You will take one million.

28
00:02:35,087 --> 00:02:38,123
Golly, that was a big one!

29
00:02:39,892 --> 00:02:42,098
Well, have it your way, Fang.

30
00:02:42,728 --> 00:02:44,830
One million pounds.

31
00:02:44,930 --> 00:02:48,868
I trust that you have
brought the treasuries?

32
00:02:55,674 --> 00:02:59,018
I think I'll keep the money.
And the vase.

33
00:03:00,646 --> 00:03:02,748
You cheated me in our last deal.

34
00:03:04,249 --> 00:03:07,520
I paid three million for that tapestry,

35
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:11,723
then found out it is worth only one!

36
00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:19,931
You took from me.
Now I will take from you.

37
00:03:20,799 --> 00:03:25,137
Now, you look here, Fang!
Fat. Fang Fat.

38
00:03:25,237 --> 00:03:27,172
I'm an art dealer, not a charlatan.

39
00:03:27,272 --> 00:03:31,410
A rogue, perhaps, a scamp
or scoundrel, I will grant you.

40
00:03:31,510 --> 00:03:35,107
But never an outright mountebank.

41
00:03:35,207 --> 00:03:37,049
Enough!

42
00:03:37,149 --> 00:03:42,257
You owe me. I believe a finger
would be fair. Don't you?

43
00:03:42,357 --> 00:03:44,173
No!

44
00:03:45,924 --> 00:03:47,026
Jock!

45
00:03:50,762 --> 00:03:53,265
I wouldn't, mate. I really wouldn't.

46
00:03:55,267 --> 00:03:58,203
Jockie, thank heavens!
Where have you been, man?

47
00:03:58,303 --> 00:04:00,597
Right behind you as always, sir.

48
00:04:16,154 --> 00:04:17,362
Jock!

49
00:04:21,126 --> 00:04:23,562
Well done, Jockie.

50
00:04:23,662 --> 00:04:25,731
It's a privilege, sir!

51
00:04:45,917 --> 00:04:47,902
Jock, you're ablaze!

52
00:04:56,995 --> 00:05:00,633
- Well, I think our work here is done.
- Time to go, sir.

53
00:05:08,173 --> 00:05:11,343
<i>Jock laid out the state
of our financial affairs.</i>

54
00:05:11,443 --> 00:05:13,945
<i>Basically, they involved debt.</i>

55
00:05:14,045 --> 00:05:16,715
<i>Massive, crushing debt.</i>

56
00:05:17,215 --> 00:05:20,786
<i>We hurried back to Mortdecai Manor,
where my beloved wife, Johanna,</i>

57
00:05:20,886 --> 00:05:23,455
<i>having heard of our financial distress,</i>

58
00:05:23,555 --> 00:05:27,213
<i>was arriving home to sell off
some of my prized possessions.</i>

59
00:05:28,193 --> 00:05:30,529
<i>Even my horsey picture
was on the block.</i>

60
00:05:32,164 --> 00:05:36,168
<i>But I was hopeful my new moustache</i>
<i>would cheer her up.</i>

61
00:05:36,268 --> 00:05:37,836
Darling!

62
00:05:37,936 --> 00:05:40,339
Oh, God, I missed you terribly.

63
00:05:40,439 --> 00:05:44,710
<i>Johanna. Love of my life.
Apple of my eye.</i>

64
00:05:44,810 --> 00:05:47,079
I so wish you had been there.

65
00:05:47,179 --> 00:05:51,049
Can you imagine the two of us
in that frigid city,

66
00:05:51,149 --> 00:05:55,421
only our passions keeping us...
Whoa! What is that?

67
00:05:55,821 --> 00:05:59,057
Just a little something I cooked up
whilst you were away, my darling.

68
00:05:59,157 --> 00:06:01,327
I do believe it was
Maggie Thatcher who said

69
00:06:01,427 --> 00:06:04,265
that kissing a man without a moustache

70
00:06:04,365 --> 00:06:07,533
is rather like eating an egg
without salt.

71
00:06:07,633 --> 00:06:10,803
- Oh, don't point that thing at me.
- Told ya.

72
00:06:12,504 --> 00:06:16,408
I have put no inconsiderable thought
and effort into this endeavor.

73
00:06:16,508 --> 00:06:19,978
You see, the domain of a man's
upper lip is his sovereign ground...

74
00:06:20,078 --> 00:06:23,339
- You have five minutes to shave it off.
- Every Mortdecai man before me

75
00:06:23,439 --> 00:06:27,150
had the same. Why can't I?

76
00:06:29,721 --> 00:06:31,723
Oh, I happen to be terribly fond of it,

77
00:06:31,823 --> 00:06:36,629
and I have had every intention
of seeing it through.

78
00:06:37,229 --> 00:06:40,132
You mean it's going to get bigger?

79
00:06:40,532 --> 00:06:42,968
It will come to fruition, yes.

80
00:06:43,368 --> 00:06:46,371
Oh, darling...

81
00:06:47,673 --> 00:06:49,636
You really won't shave it off?

82
00:06:51,910 --> 00:06:57,916
I can't, my duck. Not at this juncture.
It's not even fully corked. It's a baby.

83
00:06:58,216 --> 00:07:00,485
- Jock?
- Yes, madam?

84
00:07:00,585 --> 00:07:03,755
Please, will you make up
the guest bedroom for Mr. Mortdecai?

85
00:07:03,855 --> 00:07:05,291
Already have, madam.

86
00:07:05,391 --> 00:07:07,606
And I shan't be having dinner
downstairs this evening.

87
00:07:07,706 --> 00:07:10,729
I'll just have a supper tray
in my room.

88
00:07:10,829 --> 00:07:12,855
Very good, madam.

89
00:07:15,367 --> 00:07:16,768
I do believe Jock has informed you

90
00:07:16,868 --> 00:07:20,431
that we are staring down
the barrel of insolvency.

91
00:07:20,533 --> 00:07:22,410
What do you plan to do about it?

92
00:07:22,510 --> 00:07:24,910
Right. Yes, well...

93
00:07:25,010 --> 00:07:29,187
That... Well... Quite.

94
00:07:29,287 --> 00:07:32,834
First thing we're doing
is selling off that Sheridan.

95
00:07:35,987 --> 00:07:37,723
My sweet little love beast,

96
00:07:37,823 --> 00:07:41,748
I am sure that we will come up with the
necessary funds by the end of the month.

97
00:07:41,848 --> 00:07:44,296
- What is today, the fifth!
- The 26th, sir.

98
00:07:44,396 --> 00:07:46,649
- All right. That gives us six...
- Four days, sir.

99
00:07:46,749 --> 00:07:49,735
Jock? Please can you take the Sheridan
up to London in the morning?

100
00:07:49,835 --> 00:07:51,870
I'm entering it in the Autumn
Masters Auction.

101
00:07:51,970 --> 00:07:55,375
- Right you are, madam.
- Come, come. Let's not be rash.

102
00:07:55,475 --> 00:07:58,977
We cannot go about selling off
family heirlooms willy-nilly.

103
00:07:59,077 --> 00:08:02,347
I'm afraid I shall have
to put my foot down, darling.

104
00:08:02,447 --> 00:08:04,449
Sorry?

105
00:08:04,549 --> 00:08:06,689
With your permission, of course.

106
00:08:09,855 --> 00:08:13,225
Bugger it. Oh, there he is.

107
00:08:14,826 --> 00:08:16,895
She'll come around, Jock.
How could she not?

108
00:08:16,995 --> 00:08:19,298
She's only human, sir.

109
00:08:19,598 --> 00:08:21,800
<i>A quick aside about Jock.</i>

110
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:24,803
<i>In addition to being
my manservant and thug,</i>

111
00:08:24,903 --> 00:08:29,274
<i>he also maintains an enviable rate
of sexual intercourse,</i>

112
00:08:30,576 --> 00:08:33,278
<i>which can be occasionally problematic.</i>

113
00:08:33,378 --> 00:08:39,017
<i>Recently, after we'd concluded the sale
of a painting to a wealthy turkey farmer...</i>

114
00:08:40,052 --> 00:08:42,003
What was that?

115
00:08:43,121 --> 00:08:47,058
- Get your head down, sir.
- What have you done now, man?

116
00:08:47,793 --> 00:08:51,246
Onward, Jock! Onward!
Don't shoot, farmer!

117
00:08:51,346 --> 00:08:54,365
Dad! What the hell are you doing?

118
00:08:55,333 --> 00:08:59,471
Jock! Jock, wait! Jock!
I have me own apartment!

119
00:08:59,571 --> 00:09:03,108
Crikey, man! The farmer's daughter?

120
00:09:03,208 --> 00:09:05,143
I only gave her the once-over.

121
00:09:05,243 --> 00:09:08,980
- Where do you find the time?
- Sorry, twice-over.

122
00:09:09,691 --> 00:09:13,018
<i>Dear, sweet, simple Jock.</i>

123
00:09:13,118 --> 00:09:16,221
<i>Every man should have a Jock,
don't you think?</i>

124
00:09:21,159 --> 00:09:24,696
<i>Meanwhile, not far away,</i>

125
00:09:24,796 --> 00:09:27,265
<i>our fortunes were about
to become intertwined</i>

126
00:09:27,365 --> 00:09:32,395
<i>with one of the art world's
greatest mysteries.</i>

127
00:09:34,506 --> 00:09:37,142
<i>And a dead hag.</i>

128
00:09:41,679 --> 00:09:42,714
Bull's-eye.

129
00:09:52,557 --> 00:09:56,261
Miss Bronwen? Everything all right?

130
00:10:31,696 --> 00:10:33,732
Get back behind the tape!

131
00:10:33,832 --> 00:10:37,373
Excuse me. This is a crime scene.

132
00:10:38,670 --> 00:10:40,736
Hello?

133
00:10:40,836 --> 00:10:42,273
Who is this guy?

134
00:10:42,373 --> 00:10:46,011
You and your men have done an admirable job
stomping all over the place.

135
00:10:46,111 --> 00:10:49,147
Your services are no longer required.

136
00:10:50,148 --> 00:10:53,117
Sorry, Inspector Martland, sir.

137
00:10:53,851 --> 00:10:56,888
Sorry, sir. I had no idea, sir.

138
00:10:59,357 --> 00:11:02,360
Can I have all Thames Valley
police officers back in their cars, please?

139
00:11:02,460 --> 00:11:05,483
There's been a jurisdictional change.

140
00:11:14,206 --> 00:11:16,541
That painting could be
anywhere by now, sir.

141
00:11:16,641 --> 00:11:19,210
Yes, I suppose it could.

142
00:11:19,310 --> 00:11:21,679
You know we're going to
have to ring him, don't you, sir?

143
00:11:21,779 --> 00:11:23,381
No, I do not know that, Maurice.

144
00:11:23,481 --> 00:11:25,783
No one knows the filthy underside
of the art world better than he, sir.

145
00:11:25,883 --> 00:11:28,386
He is the filthy underside.

146
00:11:29,654 --> 00:11:32,190
Why did it have to be art?

147
00:11:33,625 --> 00:11:37,729
<i>Inspector Alastair Martland. MI5.</i>

148
00:11:37,829 --> 00:11:40,065
<i>Martland and I met at Oxford.</i>

149
00:11:40,165 --> 00:11:42,868
<i>Once in a while I provide him
with some off-the-record help</i>

150
00:11:42,968 --> 00:11:46,271
<i>with the seedier side
of art collecting.</i>

151
00:11:46,371 --> 00:11:52,477
<i>And in exchange, he gives me
a wide berth to ply my craft.</i>

152
00:11:52,577 --> 00:11:56,315
<i>He is also desperately in love
with my wife.</i>

153
00:11:56,915 --> 00:11:59,517
<i>Rather annoying, really.</i>

154
00:11:59,617 --> 00:12:00,883
What?

155
00:12:00,983 --> 00:12:02,911
Inspector Martland, sir.

156
00:12:03,011 --> 00:12:05,657
What does that blighter want?

157
00:12:05,757 --> 00:12:08,093
Tell him to ring back when my marriage
isn't falling apart.

158
00:12:08,193 --> 00:12:11,363
- No, he's here, sir.
- He is?

159
00:12:11,463 --> 00:12:14,499
Oh, all right. Wheel him in.

160
00:12:16,601 --> 00:12:19,671
- Don't get up.
- I wasn't going to.

161
00:12:20,605 --> 00:12:24,310
Beware the carafe on the top shelf.
It contains water.

162
00:12:25,110 --> 00:12:27,846
<i>Ignoring some of the more
inviting bottles on the drinks tray,</i>

163
00:12:27,946 --> 00:12:30,247
<i>he reached underneath
for the big decanter,</i>

164
00:12:30,347 --> 00:12:35,053
<i>and poured himself a gross amount
of what he thought was my Taylor '31.</i>

165
00:12:35,153 --> 00:12:37,405
<i>Score one for Mortdecai,</i>

166
00:12:37,505 --> 00:12:42,060
<i>for I had filled it with an invalid port
of unbelievable nastiness.</i>

167
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:44,830
- Oh, excellent.
- <i>Score two.</i>

168
00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:47,583
Bit of cheese to go with that?

169
00:12:47,866 --> 00:12:51,101
I should think the special one, Jock.

170
00:13:03,581 --> 00:13:05,784
What is that infernal thing
on your lip?

171
00:13:07,218 --> 00:13:08,820
Is there a purpose to your presence?

172
00:13:09,020 --> 00:13:11,056
You're in the hole
to Her Majesty's government

173
00:13:11,156 --> 00:13:13,925
to the tune of eight million
quid, old boy.

174
00:13:14,225 --> 00:13:18,631
I had no idea I was so deep
in Her Majesty's hole.

175
00:13:22,934 --> 00:13:26,504
God, oh, God, oh, God, oh, God...

176
00:13:40,251 --> 00:13:41,793
That's not natural.

177
00:13:44,756 --> 00:13:46,778
What do you think?

178
00:13:49,561 --> 00:13:51,897
I think this woman
has need of a chiropractor.

179
00:13:51,997 --> 00:13:55,433
Bronwen Fellworthy,
Oxford art restorer. Did you know her?

180
00:13:55,833 --> 00:14:00,271
Slightly. I do recall
a vague memory of her having once,

181
00:14:00,371 --> 00:14:03,396
involuntarily, one would hope,

182
00:14:03,695 --> 00:14:08,546
releasing a fart of such frightening
power and timbre

183
00:14:08,646 --> 00:14:12,150
that I feared she had done herself
a horrible mischief.

184
00:14:12,250 --> 00:14:13,404
Cheese.

185
00:14:14,352 --> 00:14:16,198
Thank you.

186
00:14:26,631 --> 00:14:31,136
Three months ago, a small Spanish museum
sent her a Goya to be cleaned.

187
00:14:31,236 --> 00:14:35,473
Last night she was killed.
Painting has disappeared.

188
00:14:35,573 --> 00:14:38,109
Sad news, particularly for her.

189
00:14:38,209 --> 00:14:40,785
But I don't see
what it has to do with me.

190
00:14:40,885 --> 00:14:45,316
Well, if my men start asking questions,
then the Goya disappears without a trace.

191
00:14:45,416 --> 00:14:50,888
But you, a known trafficker of stolen art,
well, you could make some inquiries.

192
00:14:50,988 --> 00:14:55,093
Why would MI5 be interested
in the theft of a middling Goya?

193
00:14:59,197 --> 00:15:03,342
Emil Strago.
Fundamentalist, revolutionary.

194
00:15:03,442 --> 00:15:07,872
Trained in Syria, fought in Senegal.
An expert in special warfare.

195
00:15:07,972 --> 00:15:11,342
He's linked to a number of terror attacks
all around the world.

196
00:15:11,442 --> 00:15:13,144
All right, he's unpleasant.
What of him?

197
00:15:13,244 --> 00:15:18,166
Well, we believe he entered the country
with the purpose of finding that painting.

198
00:15:18,266 --> 00:15:20,351
- Why?
- We don't know why.

199
00:15:20,451 --> 00:15:23,021
But if Strago is involved,
well, suffice it to say,

200
00:15:23,121 --> 00:15:25,874
it's a matter
of urgent national security.

201
00:15:25,974 --> 00:15:29,860
And you would like me
to find it before he does?

202
00:15:30,461 --> 00:15:32,306
Precisely.

203
00:15:33,665 --> 00:15:36,367
I've given you a lot of rope
over the years, Charlie.

204
00:15:36,467 --> 00:15:38,885
But now you're dangling
off the end of it.

205
00:15:39,637 --> 00:15:41,673
Help me find that painting,

206
00:15:41,773 --> 00:15:45,076
or I'll have the magistrate open that file
and prosecute at random.

207
00:15:45,176 --> 00:15:49,280
<i>It was a catalogue of some
of my more unseemly escapades.</i>

208
00:15:49,380 --> 00:15:54,386
<i>The file was fat and well-handled,
like a Welsh barmaid.</i>

209
00:15:54,886 --> 00:15:57,789
It is apparent that you
are well-versed in the stick.

210
00:15:57,889 --> 00:16:00,592
But what of the well-known carrot?

211
00:16:02,393 --> 00:16:05,214
- What's in it for me, as they say?
- Good God, man!

212
00:16:05,314 --> 00:16:09,601
We're talking about a bloodthirsty extremist
threatening the lives of your countrymen.

213
00:16:10,835 --> 00:16:13,671
Well, if you won't do it for me,
do it for Queen and Country.

214
00:16:13,771 --> 00:16:15,654
No!

215
00:16:16,374 --> 00:16:20,145
All right, Queen and Country, travel
and living expenses, reasonable overhead.

216
00:16:20,245 --> 00:16:22,480
Ten percent, sir.

217
00:16:22,580 --> 00:16:25,850
And 10 percent of the insurance money
as a finder's fee.

218
00:16:26,050 --> 00:16:27,753
Done.

219
00:16:28,453 --> 00:16:31,056
Oh, and incidentally,
I asked for some cheese,

220
00:16:31,156 --> 00:16:34,692
not an instrument
of biological warfare.

221
00:16:36,594 --> 00:16:39,197
<i>Score one for Martland.</i>

222
00:16:40,598 --> 00:16:44,669
Martland... What else
can you tell me about Strago?

223
00:16:44,769 --> 00:16:48,306
Well, he's colorblind
and he's allergic to cashews.

224
00:16:48,406 --> 00:16:52,377
Goody. Every subject of the Crown and every
cashew in the Kingdom shall sleep safely.

225
00:16:52,477 --> 00:16:54,412
Johanna, you look lovely.

226
00:16:54,512 --> 00:16:56,481
Alastair.

227
00:16:56,984 --> 00:17:00,285
You do look lovely, darling.
So absolutely lovely.

228
00:17:00,385 --> 00:17:04,049
- I thought that was you.
- Radiant...

229
00:17:04,149 --> 00:17:06,425
<i>Martland also met Johanna at school.</i>

230
00:17:07,558 --> 00:17:10,395
<i>After a three-year courtship,
he finally worked up the courage</i>

231
00:17:10,495 --> 00:17:13,323
<i>to express his feelings to her.</i>

232
00:17:13,423 --> 00:17:15,500
<i>In verse.</i>

233
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:17,368
Johanna, do you...

234
00:17:17,468 --> 00:17:19,370
<i>Rotten timing for him.</i>

235
00:17:19,470 --> 00:17:21,309
- Martland.
- Hello!

236
00:17:21,409 --> 00:17:24,375
Would you mind terribly,
dear boy, the door?

237
00:17:24,475 --> 00:17:26,661
Of course, I'll just...
I'll shut the door.

238
00:17:26,761 --> 00:17:29,280
Now, what's all this
about a missing Goya?

239
00:17:29,380 --> 00:17:34,085
Oh, it's the house. Terribly vast.
Echo-ey, don't you know?

240
00:17:36,237 --> 00:17:38,323
Well, that's classified information,
I'm afraid.

241
00:17:38,423 --> 00:17:41,326
You know, state secrets
and what have you.

242
00:17:41,426 --> 00:17:45,163
My husband is trying to reclaim his youth
by growing that horrible moustache.

243
00:17:45,263 --> 00:17:47,399
Do inform him
that that ship has sailed.

244
00:17:47,499 --> 00:17:50,168
Every Mortdecai man
before me has had one.

245
00:17:50,268 --> 00:17:53,210
And I will have you know that some members
of the fairer sex

246
00:17:53,310 --> 00:17:55,710
do find it quite appealing.

247
00:17:55,810 --> 00:17:57,767
Whom exactly?

248
00:18:01,145 --> 00:18:03,448
No one in particular, of course.

249
00:18:03,548 --> 00:18:06,117
Metaphoric woman... women.

250
00:18:06,217 --> 00:18:10,605
Metaphorically... general... you know.

251
00:18:10,955 --> 00:18:15,726
If you are growing that excrement
on your lip to please another, know this:

252
00:18:15,826 --> 00:18:17,862
I will kill her.

253
00:18:17,962 --> 00:18:21,866
Oh, Alastair. It's so lovely.
Do come back.

254
00:18:21,966 --> 00:18:25,736
It's so wonderful to have someone
of reasonable intelligence to converse with.

255
00:18:25,836 --> 00:18:28,073
I'd be delighted.

256
00:18:28,573 --> 00:18:32,043
Do I detect a slight crack
in the marital armor?

257
00:18:32,143 --> 00:18:34,145
A mere tiff, old bean. Nothing more.

258
00:18:34,245 --> 00:18:36,764
Oh, really? Seems like
more than a tiff to me.

259
00:18:36,864 --> 00:18:40,918
My wife needs to come around
to a certain viewpoint. That is all.

260
00:18:41,385 --> 00:18:44,602
Well, good luck, mate.
See what you can dig up about that Goya.

261
00:18:44,702 --> 00:18:46,625
Usual channels.
We'll meet in London tomorrow.

262
00:18:46,725 --> 00:18:48,595
Of course.

263
00:18:55,176 --> 00:18:59,937
I had the painting in my hand.
Someone must have known I was coming.

264
00:19:00,605 --> 00:19:03,841
Milton Krampf? The American?

265
00:19:03,941 --> 00:19:06,743
Then it must have been his dealer.

266
00:19:10,007 --> 00:19:12,980
Krampf's dealer, what is his name?

267
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:15,154
Mortdecai.

268
00:19:23,027 --> 00:19:25,763
Johanna, my darling.

269
00:19:25,863 --> 00:19:29,033
My... My love. My...

270
00:19:29,133 --> 00:19:32,904
My only true love. My... love beast.

271
00:19:33,004 --> 00:19:36,140
My rumpus room rascal.

272
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:40,778
You have no idea the beast
you are about to receive.

273
00:19:46,584 --> 00:19:48,610
Johanna?

274
00:19:49,253 --> 00:19:52,330
Are you all right in there, darling?

275
00:19:52,957 --> 00:19:55,520
It is I, Charlie.

276
00:19:55,933 --> 00:19:56,947
Your husband.

277
00:19:59,397 --> 00:20:02,633
- What is it?
- Moon of my delight.

278
00:20:02,733 --> 00:20:07,505
This is your own personalized Sheik of Araby
who seeks admission into your tent.

279
00:20:08,105 --> 00:20:10,475
I have come to carry you off
to the burning desert,

280
00:20:10,575 --> 00:20:13,010
and work my greasy will upon you...

281
00:20:13,510 --> 00:20:15,713
under the tropical stars.

282
00:20:15,913 --> 00:20:19,417
Send your camel to bed, damn it!

283
00:20:20,718 --> 00:20:22,398
My Sheik,

284
00:20:22,498 --> 00:20:26,791
does this mean you have excommunicated
that moustache of the Prophet?

285
00:20:28,926 --> 00:20:30,993
I'll trim it.

286
00:20:33,531 --> 00:20:35,400
Darling,

287
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:38,703
I am embarking
on a very dangerous escapade

288
00:20:38,803 --> 00:20:42,073
from which I may not well return.

289
00:20:42,173 --> 00:20:46,679
And it is customary
in these situations for, you know...

290
00:20:47,344 --> 00:20:48,946
a proper send-off.

291
00:20:49,046 --> 00:20:51,950
Quick session of congress.

292
00:20:52,450 --> 00:20:56,688
Sink the Bismarck, if you will.
And by the way, did I mention...

293
00:20:58,055 --> 00:21:01,976
it is a matter of national security.

294
00:21:10,201 --> 00:21:12,904
It's very difficult for me
as well, you know,

295
00:21:13,004 --> 00:21:15,373
this thing that's come between us.

296
00:21:15,473 --> 00:21:18,042
I know, darling.

297
00:21:23,947 --> 00:21:26,517
No, no. Steady yourself.

298
00:21:27,985 --> 00:21:31,723
I beg you, darling, please. You know
I have a sympathetic gag reflex.

299
00:21:31,823 --> 00:21:34,492
Oh, God. It's unbearable.

300
00:21:34,592 --> 00:21:37,562
- You will get used to it. I promise.
- Why should I have to?

301
00:21:37,762 --> 00:21:39,564
I'm invested in it.

302
00:21:39,664 --> 00:21:43,301
Why can't you invest in saving us
from financial ruin?

303
00:21:43,401 --> 00:21:45,770
Or do you want me
to sort it out for you?

304
00:21:46,771 --> 00:21:50,875
Heavens, no.
You needn't worry yourself.

305
00:21:50,975 --> 00:21:53,729
I have things firmly...

306
00:21:53,829 --> 00:21:56,171
in hand.

307
00:22:04,255 --> 00:22:05,923
My love, you are killing me. Please.

308
00:22:06,023 --> 00:22:10,260
It looked like you have
a vagina on your face.

309
00:22:11,896 --> 00:22:15,699
Surely you mean the pubic hair
above a vagina.

310
00:22:15,799 --> 00:22:17,602
I simply cannot get my head
around that image.

311
00:22:17,702 --> 00:22:21,105
- Oh, Charlie...
- However,

312
00:22:21,872 --> 00:22:27,011
now that you've mentioned it,
I'm unable to steer my mind away from it.

313
00:22:27,111 --> 00:22:30,745
Go stuff a mattress with that thing!

314
00:22:31,916 --> 00:22:34,451
The moustache, I mean.

315
00:22:39,323 --> 00:22:43,461
<i>Sheamus is able to do with a steel
chair in hand. Here we go.</i>

316
00:22:45,930 --> 00:22:47,532
Jockie,

317
00:22:47,632 --> 00:22:49,516
what if...

318
00:22:49,616 --> 00:22:51,633
it isn't just a tiff?

319
00:22:51,733 --> 00:22:55,272
What if this is the well-known "it,"
as it were?

320
00:22:55,472 --> 00:22:58,976
- That'd be awful.
- Jock?

321
00:22:59,844 --> 00:23:02,506
Are you coming back to bed?

322
00:23:04,315 --> 00:23:06,830
Yeah, give us a minute, love.

323
00:23:07,852 --> 00:23:09,153
Hi.

324
00:23:09,353 --> 00:23:11,446
Hello.

325
00:23:15,826 --> 00:23:19,369
And myself sleeping alone.

326
00:23:19,830 --> 00:23:22,099
How do you think
this makes me feel, man?

327
00:23:22,199 --> 00:23:24,201
I dunno, sir.

328
00:23:24,301 --> 00:23:26,237
Dash it all, I am resolved.

329
00:23:26,337 --> 00:23:28,839
If it is money we need,
then it is money we shall have.

330
00:23:28,939 --> 00:23:30,941
Jock?

331
00:23:31,041 --> 00:23:32,910
That's me.

332
00:23:34,912 --> 00:23:39,651
Tomorrow we shall sell off the Rolls
to that vulgar American, Milton Krampf,

333
00:23:39,751 --> 00:23:43,587
and we will find that painting
if it is the last thing we do.

334
00:23:43,687 --> 00:23:46,023
Right-y-oh. I'll call Spinoza
in the morning.

335
00:23:46,123 --> 00:23:47,892
- Yes, do.
- Good night, sir.

336
00:23:48,092 --> 00:23:51,028
- Jock?
- Yes, sir?

337
00:23:51,128 --> 00:23:53,164
Do you think it will be
all right in the end?

338
00:23:53,564 --> 00:23:55,496
I couldn't say, sir.

339
00:24:12,617 --> 00:24:15,453
<i>My first stop was to see
Sir Graham Archer,</i>

340
00:24:15,553 --> 00:24:19,490
<i>rival art dealer and Goya specialist.</i>

341
00:24:19,590 --> 00:24:23,994
<i>A permanent fixture at Sedgwick's
Auction House in Kensington.</i>

342
00:24:25,730 --> 00:24:27,898
I will meet you
at Spinoza's in one hour.

343
00:24:27,998 --> 00:24:30,025
Right you are, sir.

344
00:24:40,978 --> 00:24:44,749
<i>Sir Graham has been the rudest man
in England for years.</i>

345
00:24:44,849 --> 00:24:49,353
<i>Recently, he's been working
his way up to the wickedest.</i>

346
00:24:52,389 --> 00:24:55,125
Looks like something curled up
and died on your lip.

347
00:24:55,225 --> 00:24:57,128
It's not herpetic, I hope.

348
00:24:57,228 --> 00:25:00,264
Hello, Sir Graham, you old member.

349
00:25:00,553 --> 00:25:02,199
Who are you hiding in your belly?

350
00:25:02,299 --> 00:25:07,604
I see you've put your Sheridan up
in next week's sale. Hard times, old boy?

351
00:25:07,704 --> 00:25:12,276
No, no, no, no. Just getting rid of some
choice items while the market's right.

352
00:25:12,376 --> 00:25:15,825
What do you make of
this Bronwen business?

353
00:25:15,925 --> 00:25:21,218
Ghastly affair. One always bemoans
the loss of a great restorer.

354
00:25:21,318 --> 00:25:24,855
Old bag. She should have
put locks on her doors.

355
00:25:25,589 --> 00:25:27,658
You used her frequently, didn't you?

356
00:25:27,758 --> 00:25:31,796
Not lately. She's been unavailable
for three months.

357
00:25:31,896 --> 00:25:34,976
The Goya she was cleaning...

358
00:25:36,033 --> 00:25:38,803
rather simple job, wouldn't you say?

359
00:25:38,903 --> 00:25:41,672
Usual dirt and grime
one finds on the Spaniards.

360
00:25:41,772 --> 00:25:45,008
Haven't the foggiest
why it took her so long.

361
00:25:45,609 --> 00:25:49,013
What's your sudden interest,
if I may ask?

362
00:25:49,113 --> 00:25:53,950
A client with a mild curiosity,
that's all.

363
00:25:57,021 --> 00:26:01,591
We must go shooting again.
Jock has fully recovered.

364
00:26:09,533 --> 00:26:14,672
There's only one reason you might be
interested in a museum-owned Goya,

365
00:26:14,772 --> 00:26:18,175
and that's because
there's money involved.

366
00:26:18,275 --> 00:26:20,377
You are mistaken, sir.

367
00:26:20,477 --> 00:26:24,281
There's a great deal of money involved.

368
00:26:26,683 --> 00:26:30,454
I've always admired your rapacity, sir.

369
00:26:32,389 --> 00:26:34,804
I say, Sir Graham, I wonder,

370
00:26:34,904 --> 00:26:38,276
your... protrusion...

371
00:26:38,376 --> 00:26:43,777
Might it be possible to swing
the old fellow north, as it were?

372
00:26:47,204 --> 00:26:49,607
Who's the client?

373
00:26:49,707 --> 00:26:52,808
Terribly sorry, sworn to secrecy.

374
00:26:54,712 --> 00:26:58,343
Perhaps a brisk walk down the stairs
will do some good.

375
00:26:58,443 --> 00:27:00,287
Yes.

376
00:27:03,020 --> 00:27:06,056
So it's that sort of Goya.

377
00:27:07,091 --> 00:27:09,138
<i>Romanov.</i>

378
00:27:09,994 --> 00:27:13,664
That painted lady
you've been searching for,

379
00:27:13,764 --> 00:27:17,434
I believe she may be in play.

380
00:27:17,534 --> 00:27:19,549
<i>I want that painting.</i>

381
00:27:26,276 --> 00:27:29,032
- Johanna!
- Alastair.

382
00:27:29,580 --> 00:27:32,138
So glad you called.

383
00:27:32,683 --> 00:27:35,653
I've asked for a Chardonnay.
That is your drink, isn't it?

384
00:27:35,753 --> 00:27:37,822
Oh, you remembered.

385
00:27:38,522 --> 00:27:40,257
Thank you.

386
00:27:40,357 --> 00:27:43,894
Oh, God. How thoughtless of me.
You're on duty.

387
00:27:44,254 --> 00:27:47,797
And in charge, thank you very much.

388
00:27:49,566 --> 00:27:51,402
To what do I owe the pleasure?

389
00:27:51,502 --> 00:27:53,704
I was just in the neighborhood
and thought I'd pop 'round,

390
00:27:53,804 --> 00:27:56,373
and see how you secret agent men
run the world.

391
00:27:56,673 --> 00:28:00,711
Not nearly.
Although it is terribly vital work.

392
00:28:00,811 --> 00:28:04,181
It's not all chardonnay
and afternoon trysts.

393
00:28:04,381 --> 00:28:06,550
Is this a tryst?

394
00:28:06,650 --> 00:28:09,110
No, no. No, no, no.

395
00:28:09,210 --> 00:28:11,332
No, no, no, no, no.

396
00:28:11,432 --> 00:28:15,926
No, no, no, no.
No, no, no, no. No, no, no.

397
00:28:16,026 --> 00:28:19,462
- No, I was just...
- Of course you were.

398
00:28:20,097 --> 00:28:22,610
How are things at home?

399
00:28:22,900 --> 00:28:24,735
You've touched a nerve.

400
00:28:24,835 --> 00:28:28,172
You've sensed it, Alastair.
You always were the sensitive one.

401
00:28:28,472 --> 00:28:30,714
- You've got a difficult chap.
- Beastly.

402
00:28:30,814 --> 00:28:34,611
- Bit of a moron, actually.
- Maybe I should have an affair.

403
00:28:34,711 --> 00:28:36,981
- Wouldn't that be funny?
- Hilarious.

404
00:28:37,081 --> 00:28:39,303
- Do you think I could keep it a secret?
- Yes!

405
00:28:39,403 --> 00:28:41,118
Well then, what's the point?

406
00:28:41,218 --> 00:28:44,589
Now, tell me, what are you and my husband
working on at the moment?

407
00:28:44,889 --> 00:28:46,631
Oh...

408
00:28:47,031 --> 00:28:48,881
Well, in vague terms
there's a very bad man

409
00:28:48,981 --> 00:28:50,770
who wants what I want,
and I'm trying to stop him.

410
00:28:50,870 --> 00:28:54,999
And what does a missing Goya
have to do with national security?

411
00:28:55,099 --> 00:28:56,900
In vague terms.

412
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,602
Johanna...

413
00:28:58,702 --> 00:29:01,472
You think poor Miss Fellworthy
stumbled into something,

414
00:29:01,572 --> 00:29:05,075
- and that's why she got killed.
- I really can't say.

415
00:29:05,628 --> 00:29:07,711
This is interesting.

416
00:29:07,811 --> 00:29:11,015
Creates quite a market when a painting
with a little mystery goes missing.

417
00:29:11,115 --> 00:29:14,751
So much to do. What was the name
of Bronwen's college at Oxford?

418
00:29:14,851 --> 00:29:18,555
Johanna, I simply can't.

419
00:29:18,655 --> 00:29:21,702
Right. Sorry.

420
00:29:21,802 --> 00:29:24,929
Oh, golly. Look at the time.
I really must be going.

421
00:29:25,029 --> 00:29:26,964
It was lovely to see you, Alastair.

422
00:29:27,064 --> 00:29:30,034
Thank you ever-so-much
for letting me confide in you.

423
00:29:30,134 --> 00:29:33,136
I feel that I could share
anything with you.

424
00:29:33,964 --> 00:29:36,325
Don't you feel the same?

425
00:29:36,425 --> 00:29:38,976
That you could share with me?

426
00:29:39,076 --> 00:29:40,577
Bronwen's college?

427
00:29:40,677 --> 00:29:43,580
You're rather monstrous.
Of course you're aware of that.

428
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:46,684
- Blackfriar's Hall.
- We must do this again.

429
00:29:48,485 --> 00:29:50,438
Hopeless.

430
00:29:56,453 --> 00:30:00,164
<i>Besides being the finest garage man
in Western Civilization,</i>

431
00:30:00,264 --> 00:30:04,969
<i>Spinoza was the best
art smuggler in the business,</i>

432
00:30:05,069 --> 00:30:10,006
<i>and the eyes and ears
of the art world's underbelly.</i>

433
00:30:10,750 --> 00:30:15,913
Hello, Spinoza, you handsome devil!
It's a fine day to be alive, what?

434
00:30:16,013 --> 00:30:20,551
You bloody chicken, bloody monkey,
so good-for-nothing pot of piss, innit?

435
00:30:20,651 --> 00:30:23,620
Spinoza, you silver-tongued scallywag.

436
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:25,271
What's the matter with you?

437
00:30:25,371 --> 00:30:29,767
You one book short of a library, you maggot?
You one megabyte short of a RAM?

438
00:30:29,867 --> 00:30:32,596
<i>The rest was a bit rude,
so I won't quote him verbatim.</i>

439
00:30:32,696 --> 00:30:36,633
<i>But what vexed him so was a matter
of some overdue bills on the Rolls,</i>

440
00:30:36,733 --> 00:30:41,072
<i>which I had now asked him to package
and ship off to America on credit.</i>

441
00:30:41,572 --> 00:30:44,274
You mother-loving bastard! Hello.

442
00:30:44,774 --> 00:30:50,046
Right. Spinoza, I did not come here
to discuss my relationship with my mother,

443
00:30:50,146 --> 00:30:52,482
nor my relationship to your mother.

444
00:30:52,582 --> 00:30:56,753
No. We have two items of business.
Item one: The Rolls-Royce,

445
00:30:56,853 --> 00:31:02,659
which I have reluctantly agreed to sell
to that thick-fingered American, Krampf.

446
00:31:02,759 --> 00:31:04,330
Item the second:

447
00:31:04,430 --> 00:31:09,233
I need to ascertain whether any
unsavory types have enlisted you

448
00:31:09,333 --> 00:31:12,636
to smuggle a painting
out of the country recently.

449
00:31:12,736 --> 00:31:17,741
And for your information,
I am holding up

450
00:31:17,841 --> 00:31:21,242
a 50-pound note.

451
00:31:22,046 --> 00:31:23,447
Never mind about that.

452
00:31:23,547 --> 00:31:26,984
You should treat
a jam jar car like this

453
00:31:27,084 --> 00:31:30,487
with more respect when you drive it
down the frog and toad road.

454
00:31:30,587 --> 00:31:33,389
- It's not some Toyota Clitoris.
- No, no.

455
00:31:33,489 --> 00:31:37,194
No! Is a Rolls... The bloody Silver,

456
00:31:37,294 --> 00:31:40,897
the whacking Cloud, the bollock Royce!

457
00:31:40,997 --> 00:31:43,079
Someone shooting at the bloody car!

458
00:31:44,501 --> 00:31:46,294
Someone shooting at me!

459
00:31:55,879 --> 00:31:57,900
I'm armed!

460
00:32:05,055 --> 00:32:07,891
- Oh, Jock!
- Yeah.

461
00:32:07,991 --> 00:32:12,730
<i>I should probably mention that this
was not the first time I had shot Jock.</i>

462
00:32:13,230 --> 00:32:16,529
Come on, you little bastards.
Come out and get it.

463
00:32:27,047 --> 00:32:30,380
Afraid I'm all thumbs
with these damn things!

464
00:32:32,416 --> 00:32:35,119
- I believe I've just shot Jock.
- Quite.

465
00:32:35,819 --> 00:32:38,022
Man down! Man down!

466
00:32:38,422 --> 00:32:40,891
- Could you give me the gun, please?
- This bit?

467
00:32:40,991 --> 00:32:43,327
Yes, most... No, no.

468
00:32:43,427 --> 00:32:45,796
Oh, and poor Spinoza...

469
00:32:45,896 --> 00:32:47,998
You should go, sir,
before the shooter circles 'round.

470
00:32:48,098 --> 00:32:51,035
- I'll handle things on this end.
- Quite.

471
00:32:51,335 --> 00:32:54,604
- Cover me, as it were?
- Yes, sir.

472
00:32:56,206 --> 00:32:59,410
- That's the old feudal spirit, Jock.
- Get in.

473
00:33:00,110 --> 00:33:01,925
Oh, dear!

474
00:33:05,749 --> 00:33:08,118
- Oh, Jock. Jock?
- Yeah?

475
00:33:08,218 --> 00:33:09,553
The door? Please?

476
00:33:14,990 --> 00:33:17,887
Right. Gosh, it's been ages.

477
00:33:34,244 --> 00:33:35,379
Goodness, that's awkward.

478
00:33:35,479 --> 00:33:37,882
It's all right, sir. It's all right.
It's just a cracked rib.

479
00:33:39,416 --> 00:33:41,718
Please, sir, if you wouldn't mind
leaving out the back. On foot.

480
00:33:42,359 --> 00:33:44,355
- By myself?
- Please, sir. Just leave.

481
00:33:49,860 --> 00:33:52,929
Oh, dear, oh, dear, oh, dear,
oh, dear, oh, dear...

482
00:33:53,897 --> 00:33:57,234
- Give me the painting.
- What makes you think I have it?

483
00:33:57,434 --> 00:33:58,669
Give me the painting!

484
00:33:59,904 --> 00:34:03,907
That is a superb Hulihee sans sideburn,
I must say.

485
00:34:04,107 --> 00:34:06,944
- I was admiring your Franz Joseph.
- Oh, thank you very much.

486
00:34:07,644 --> 00:34:10,152
- I'll have it on my wall.
- Jock?

487
00:34:13,550 --> 00:34:15,370
Oh, well done.

488
00:34:17,020 --> 00:34:18,990
- What should I do now?
- Run, sir!

489
00:34:19,090 --> 00:34:21,659
- Again?
- Yes!

490
00:34:24,594 --> 00:34:27,197
Run, I shall, like a bloody gazelle!

491
00:34:27,297 --> 00:34:30,967
The Mortdecai men have always been
in tip-top shape, don't you know?

492
00:34:31,067 --> 00:34:33,486
Fit as a fiddle!

493
00:34:44,648 --> 00:34:48,885
Oh, it's burning...
I... I can't go on...

494
00:34:53,223 --> 00:34:55,125
Want to die...

495
00:34:55,225 --> 00:34:57,188
No, I don't.

496
00:35:00,564 --> 00:35:02,399
Sir!

497
00:35:02,499 --> 00:35:04,267
I'm on the bonnet!

498
00:35:04,367 --> 00:35:06,870
Get in the car, sir!

499
00:35:09,706 --> 00:35:11,182
I don't like it!

500
00:35:19,615 --> 00:35:20,820
Hello!

501
00:35:29,559 --> 00:35:31,695
Jockie! Advise?

502
00:35:31,795 --> 00:35:34,831
- Get in the back seat, sir!
- Okay!

503
00:35:41,805 --> 00:35:43,407
Foreigner!

504
00:35:43,507 --> 00:35:46,410
- No!
- Out you go!

505
00:35:55,952 --> 00:35:57,254
Oh, Jock!

506
00:35:57,354 --> 00:35:59,489
Don't worry, sir.
I'm all right. I am all right.

507
00:35:59,589 --> 00:36:02,025
No, no, man! My little sproutling.

508
00:36:02,125 --> 00:36:04,128
- What?
- Has it been compromised?

509
00:36:16,106 --> 00:36:19,309
- Well done, Jock.
- It's a privilege, sir.

510
00:36:19,409 --> 00:36:21,345
Didn't take long for you
to make a mess of things.

511
00:36:21,445 --> 00:36:24,014
Oh, you listen here, you do-gooder!

512
00:36:24,114 --> 00:36:28,418
Your Emil Strago just killed my garage man
and physically assaulted my person.

513
00:36:28,518 --> 00:36:31,988
- He seems to think that I have the painting.
- What have you found?

514
00:36:32,088 --> 00:36:35,592
Well, I will tell you that there is
more here than meets the eye.

515
00:36:35,692 --> 00:36:37,528
No painting takes
three months to clean,

516
00:36:37,628 --> 00:36:40,697
so I believe that Bronwen
was working on the Goya

517
00:36:40,797 --> 00:36:44,000
and discovered something underneath.

518
00:36:44,100 --> 00:36:45,402
I should like to see
her studio immediately.

519
00:36:45,502 --> 00:36:48,437
- In the cars, quickly. Maurice, Oxford.
- Yes, sir.

520
00:36:58,014 --> 00:37:01,217
I've been helpin' out Miss Fellworthy
goin' on five years now.

521
00:37:01,317 --> 00:37:04,454
Just keepin' the place
tidy and whatnot.

522
00:37:04,554 --> 00:37:07,290
You have been grossly overcompensated.

523
00:37:07,390 --> 00:37:10,760
- Her lover was no help.
- Lover? Bronwen?

524
00:37:10,860 --> 00:37:15,364
Yeah, a Duke.
No help whatsoever, randy bugger.

525
00:37:16,266 --> 00:37:20,130
"Love... your...

526
00:37:20,230 --> 00:37:22,273
Bunny."

527
00:37:22,373 --> 00:37:24,608
Love your Bunny?

528
00:37:24,708 --> 00:37:30,312
A child! She spawned a child!
The woman bred! What an odious thought.

529
00:37:30,980 --> 00:37:32,349
Don't imbibe the crime scene.

530
00:37:32,449 --> 00:37:36,419
I found her here, sprawled over the table,
with an arrow out of her back.

531
00:37:36,519 --> 00:37:38,822
Course you did, man,
because the assailant fired from here.

532
00:37:38,922 --> 00:37:40,857
- No, from the window.
- With a spear gun.

533
00:37:40,957 --> 00:37:43,026
- With a crossbow.
- He was left-handed.

534
00:37:43,126 --> 00:37:45,218
Jesus Christ.

535
00:37:46,062 --> 00:37:47,564
Is this how she was found?

536
00:37:47,664 --> 00:37:49,166
- What are you doing?
- Oh, no. To the left a bit.

537
00:37:49,266 --> 00:37:51,501
- Like this?
- Sorry, I meant to the right.

538
00:37:51,601 --> 00:37:53,503
Like this? Like this?

539
00:37:53,803 --> 00:37:56,006
Are you quite finished buggering around?

540
00:37:56,666 --> 00:37:58,175
No.

541
00:37:58,275 --> 00:38:02,779
Because I have a question
for you, old bean.

542
00:38:02,879 --> 00:38:04,295
Will I be given a badge,

543
00:38:04,395 --> 00:38:08,685
nestled in some sort of cheap,
leather encasement, just like on telly?

544
00:38:09,085 --> 00:38:10,354
- Maurice?
- Sir?

545
00:38:10,454 --> 00:38:13,490
Show him the photographs. Excuse me.

546
00:38:14,424 --> 00:38:15,892
These were found in her camera.

547
00:38:16,292 --> 00:38:18,461
Yeah, like I told
the lady earlier today,

548
00:38:18,561 --> 00:38:21,665
Miss Bronwen would take photos
of each stage of her work, bless her.

549
00:38:22,265 --> 00:38:23,867
Which lady?

550
00:38:23,967 --> 00:38:27,671
Well, the lady with the hair and brain.

551
00:38:29,606 --> 00:38:34,310
I may have mentioned Bronwen
to Johanna at lunch today.

552
00:38:36,813 --> 00:38:38,982
You were luncheoning with my wife?

553
00:38:39,082 --> 00:38:41,702
- Let's look at the photographs.
- Yes, let's look at the photographs.

554
00:38:42,952 --> 00:38:44,954
Horrible composition.

555
00:38:45,422 --> 00:38:48,425
Lighting positively medieval.

556
00:38:48,525 --> 00:38:51,561
This one taken by accident,
utterly useless...

557
00:38:52,028 --> 00:38:53,597
Hang on a tic.

558
00:38:54,297 --> 00:38:58,335
- That is not your Goya.
- What do you mean?

559
00:38:58,435 --> 00:39:02,239
That is not the same painting
as the others.

560
00:39:02,339 --> 00:39:05,141
Where have I seen that hand
before in the background?

561
00:39:05,241 --> 00:39:08,144
Finger pointing down. Ring.

562
00:39:09,144 --> 00:39:11,247
Good Lord! It couldn't be!

563
00:39:11,347 --> 00:39:14,652
- Couldn't be what?
- To the library, chaps!

564
00:39:19,789 --> 00:39:23,126
There has never been
an accurate reproduction because...

565
00:39:23,226 --> 00:39:26,062
it vanished after the unveiling, but...

566
00:39:26,362 --> 00:39:31,870
I do remember that there was an etching
or some such hint of... There it is.

567
00:39:32,902 --> 00:39:35,071
The Duchess of Wellington.

568
00:39:35,371 --> 00:39:39,752
Bronwen has found the lost Goya.

569
00:39:39,976 --> 00:39:44,548
Goya was commissioned by Charles IV
of Spain to paint her in 1792.

570
00:39:44,748 --> 00:39:48,618
She was said to be
his greatest masterpiece.

571
00:39:48,718 --> 00:39:50,654
Unfortunately,

572
00:39:50,754 --> 00:39:55,625
she was also said to have been
the King's mistress.

573
00:39:55,725 --> 00:39:57,427
The Queen was unamused.

574
00:39:57,627 --> 00:40:00,964
<i>Humiliated, she ordered
the painting to be burned.</i>

575
00:40:01,064 --> 00:40:04,657
<i>But instead it was stolen
and secreted away.</i>

576
00:40:04,768 --> 00:40:09,772
<i>Some say that Goya himself
engineered the theft.</i>

577
00:40:10,774 --> 00:40:15,185
For 200 years, the painting
was sought by collectors,

578
00:40:15,285 --> 00:40:19,482
craved by the mighty,
and became the stuff of legend.

579
00:40:19,582 --> 00:40:22,352
- And is the legend true?
- Does it matter?

580
00:40:22,452 --> 00:40:25,489
The truth is nice,
but a rumor is priceless.

581
00:40:25,689 --> 00:40:29,192
What does Strago want with it?
If it does exist, it belongs to Spain.

582
00:40:29,292 --> 00:40:31,528
If anyone tried to sell it,
they'd be arrested on the spot.

583
00:40:31,628 --> 00:40:34,998
Yes, well, that is where the story
gets interesting, you see.

584
00:40:35,098 --> 00:40:40,170
The Duchess pops up again
in France in 1943,

585
00:40:40,270 --> 00:40:45,742
<i>looted from some sealed room in an
unpronounceable chateau by the jerrys.</i>

586
00:40:45,842 --> 00:40:49,446
<i>Hermann Goering was said to have been
obsessed with the painting,</i>

587
00:40:49,546 --> 00:40:52,816
<i>and there are rumors
that he inscribed on it</i>

588
00:40:52,916 --> 00:40:57,287
<i>the codes to his numbered
Swiss bank account.</i>

589
00:40:57,387 --> 00:41:00,757
<i>Untold riches and all that, what?</i>

590
00:41:01,157 --> 00:41:02,859
But...

591
00:41:02,959 --> 00:41:07,030
when the allies captured Goering...

592
00:41:07,130 --> 00:41:09,666
Out of the way, out of the way.

593
00:41:09,966 --> 00:41:12,515
There was no mention of the painting.

594
00:41:13,570 --> 00:41:16,873
It had vanished
once again into history,

595
00:41:16,973 --> 00:41:19,576
and the secret bank accounts
along with it.

596
00:41:19,676 --> 00:41:22,746
- What are we talking about here?
- Hundreds and hundreds of millions,

597
00:41:22,846 --> 00:41:27,183
surrounded by all that Gruyere,
chocolate, and fine wines.

598
00:41:27,283 --> 00:41:29,753
- Well, that's what Emil's after.
- The fine wine?

599
00:41:29,853 --> 00:41:32,883
No, the fortune to fund
violent worldwide revolution.

600
00:41:32,983 --> 00:41:33,690
Right!

601
00:41:33,790 --> 00:41:37,127
Multiple attacks over the years to come,
countless lives are at stake.

602
00:41:37,427 --> 00:41:40,533
- That painting should be destroyed.
- Yeah.

603
00:41:40,633 --> 00:41:43,952
Fingers crossed, chaps,
you find it first. I'm off for a wee.

604
00:42:05,538 --> 00:42:07,957
I'm deeply, deeply flattered, young man.

605
00:42:08,057 --> 00:42:13,029
However, I myself do not swing that...

606
00:42:13,129 --> 00:42:16,196
Oh, Golly! I have read about this.

607
00:42:19,168 --> 00:42:22,506
<i>I sunk into an uneasy slumber,</i>

608
00:42:22,606 --> 00:42:28,338
<i>interspersed curiously
with erotic dreams.</i>

609
00:43:03,813 --> 00:43:06,760
Lady Mortdecai,
the Duke is expecting you.

610
00:43:07,050 --> 00:43:08,851
This way.

611
00:43:15,191 --> 00:43:18,728
Her Lady Mortdecai
to see you, Your Grace.

612
00:43:18,828 --> 00:43:21,331
The Duke of Asherboroughdon.

613
00:43:21,431 --> 00:43:23,933
Your Grace. So kind of you to see me.

614
00:43:24,033 --> 00:43:27,583
Lady Mortdecai.

615
00:43:28,638 --> 00:43:32,308
You'll forgive me
just a moment, I'm sure?

616
00:43:32,408 --> 00:43:34,252
Of course.

617
00:43:39,182 --> 00:43:41,522
Lady Mortdecai.

618
00:43:43,219 --> 00:43:48,558
Johnson! Who is this woman Mortdecai
and what does she want?

619
00:43:48,658 --> 00:43:51,561
Well, I don't know. I don't know.
Why wasn't I told?

620
00:43:52,095 --> 00:43:54,918
She's so damned attractive.

621
00:43:55,298 --> 00:43:57,888
Hello? Hello?

622
00:44:02,972 --> 00:44:05,074
Water bailiff.

623
00:44:05,174 --> 00:44:09,679
Had to speak to the water bailiff
about my water.

624
00:44:09,779 --> 00:44:12,286
Fishing tomorrow, you know.

625
00:44:12,386 --> 00:44:14,450
Hate it. Sit.

626
00:44:14,550 --> 00:44:16,975
Bloody nuisance.

627
00:44:18,337 --> 00:44:22,292
Your Grace, I... I understand
you were close with Bronwen Fellworthy.

628
00:44:22,392 --> 00:44:25,127
- Yes.
- I'm very sorry.

629
00:44:25,295 --> 00:44:29,198
Her gardener gave me your name,
and I wondered...

630
00:44:29,298 --> 00:44:32,134
The painting she was
working on in the end...

631
00:44:32,802 --> 00:44:33,725
What?

632
00:44:34,971 --> 00:44:36,940
No, I can't understand a word she says.

633
00:44:37,040 --> 00:44:40,944
I've been trying to get rid of her,
but she's so damned attractive.

634
00:44:41,444 --> 00:44:42,878
Sorry. You were saying?

635
00:44:42,978 --> 00:44:46,382
- You served in the War then, Your Grace?
- Poor old gal.

636
00:44:46,482 --> 00:44:50,887
Done to death with malice
aforethought and so forth.

637
00:44:51,287 --> 00:44:53,145
Poor Bronwen.

638
00:44:53,656 --> 00:44:55,907
The painting, Your Grace.

639
00:44:57,026 --> 00:45:00,263
Did she ever mention
The Duchess of Wellington?

640
00:45:00,363 --> 00:45:02,590
Oh. Beautiful woman.

641
00:45:02,690 --> 00:45:05,869
- Bronwen?
- Must to the lavatory.

642
00:45:05,969 --> 00:45:10,940
Would you care to come
and take a peek at it?

643
00:45:12,776 --> 00:45:16,812
An exquisite invitation, Your Grace,
but I'm afraid I must decline.

644
00:45:16,912 --> 00:45:19,740
- Let's get back to the Duchess.
- Bunny has it.

645
00:45:19,840 --> 00:45:23,219
- I beg your pardon?
- During the War. Nazi bastards.

646
00:45:23,319 --> 00:45:26,486
Bunny rolled it up in a carpet
and didn't tell a soul.

647
00:45:26,586 --> 00:45:30,193
- Bunny is a soldier in your unit?
- 7th Army, 2nd Division.

648
00:45:30,293 --> 00:45:33,697
Captured Goering.
First man in the room.

649
00:45:33,797 --> 00:45:36,132
Do you think that Bunny
still has the painting now?

650
00:45:36,232 --> 00:45:38,501
Must to the W.C.

651
00:45:40,036 --> 00:45:42,338
Do have a look?

652
00:45:42,638 --> 00:45:45,175
I'm afraid I must be going, Your Grace.

653
00:45:45,775 --> 00:45:47,710
Thank you very much for your time.

654
00:45:48,744 --> 00:45:51,181
And you are?

655
00:45:52,081 --> 00:45:56,864
The water bailiff, Your Grace.
Fishing tomorrow's been cancelled.

656
00:45:59,722 --> 00:46:01,224
Thank heaven.

657
00:46:12,635 --> 00:46:15,372
What's that? Funny.

658
00:46:28,517 --> 00:46:31,721
Right. I demand some explanations.

659
00:46:31,821 --> 00:46:34,824
No, no. Change that.
I need a restorative.

660
00:46:34,924 --> 00:46:36,726
How 'bout some finger sandwiches?

661
00:46:36,826 --> 00:46:40,146
Just the usual, you know.
Egg cress, prawn mayonnaise,

662
00:46:40,246 --> 00:46:44,367
possibly a gallon of your finest whisky
just to start the day properly.

663
00:46:44,467 --> 00:46:46,066
You know how it is, gentlemen.

664
00:46:48,002 --> 00:46:50,062
Oh, I see.

665
00:46:53,142 --> 00:46:55,078
Actually, make that caviar.

666
00:46:55,178 --> 00:46:59,015
Some warmed blinis, creme fraiche,
boiled egg whites,

667
00:46:59,115 --> 00:47:02,952
and vodka so ice cold
you need gloves to handle it.

668
00:47:03,371 --> 00:47:05,889
And don't forget the herringbone spoon.

669
00:47:05,989 --> 00:47:09,052
We're not savages, after all, are we?

670
00:47:11,094 --> 00:47:12,862
Welcome to Russia, Mr. Mortdecai.

671
00:47:14,130 --> 00:47:16,900
- And you are?
- Roman Romanov.

672
00:47:17,200 --> 00:47:20,369
Romanov. Sir Graham's client.

673
00:47:20,469 --> 00:47:22,672
So I have him to thank for this.

674
00:47:25,241 --> 00:47:27,510
Oh, that's unpleasant.

675
00:47:27,610 --> 00:47:29,712
Where's the Goya?

676
00:47:29,812 --> 00:47:32,214
- I don't know.
- But you know about art.

677
00:47:32,314 --> 00:47:35,819
A bit. You have a Turner of the Loire,
which cannot be right

678
00:47:35,919 --> 00:47:39,255
because the original is hanging
in the D'Orsay. Terribly sorry.

679
00:47:39,355 --> 00:47:42,658
A magnificent Callow of about 1840,

680
00:47:42,758 --> 00:47:45,828
a polychrome James Bourne, rare,

681
00:47:45,928 --> 00:47:49,866
a pair of rather flashy Varleys
from his last period,

682
00:47:49,966 --> 00:47:53,436
and the finest Edridge
I have ever seen.

683
00:47:53,536 --> 00:47:56,372
Yes. Where is the Goya?

684
00:47:56,572 --> 00:48:00,326
Well, where is the last place you saw it?
Have you looked under your couch?

685
00:48:00,426 --> 00:48:02,864
Yeah, because when I've lost something,
sometimes I say to myself,

686
00:48:02,964 --> 00:48:04,914
"Charlie, where could it be?"

687
00:48:06,229 --> 00:48:10,286
God! That wasn't nice!

688
00:48:10,386 --> 00:48:12,488
Oh, no! No.

689
00:48:12,588 --> 00:48:15,891
For 17 years, I pursued this painting.
You know why?

690
00:48:15,991 --> 00:48:19,027
Because I want, I will have.

691
00:48:20,730 --> 00:48:25,468
This will be easier and much
less painful if you please to tell me.

692
00:48:25,568 --> 00:48:27,170
Where is the painting?

693
00:48:27,270 --> 00:48:30,108
But why does everyone seem to think...

694
00:48:32,308 --> 00:48:36,379
Oh! You pretended to be gentle,
but you weren't!

695
00:48:36,479 --> 00:48:38,981
Milton Krampf tells everyone
he is getting painting.

696
00:48:39,081 --> 00:48:41,284
You're his dealer,
so you have painting!

697
00:48:41,384 --> 00:48:44,187
I am very sorry. I simply don't know.

698
00:48:44,287 --> 00:48:49,299
Dmitri, please to fetch
12-volt high-tension car battery.

699
00:48:49,859 --> 00:48:52,862
I am afraid you are barking up
the wrong Englishman, comrade.

700
00:48:52,962 --> 00:48:56,299
Vladimir, please to take
Mr. Mortdecai's trousers down.

701
00:48:58,935 --> 00:49:01,273
Perhaps we can work something out.

702
00:49:01,373 --> 00:49:05,341
What if I find it for you?
Say, 30% finder's fee, what?

703
00:49:05,441 --> 00:49:06,946
Open your balls.

704
00:49:10,012 --> 00:49:13,219
I shan't! What does that even mean?

705
00:49:15,918 --> 00:49:17,444
I'll go to 20.

706
00:49:18,754 --> 00:49:19,756
Balls.

707
00:49:20,890 --> 00:49:23,457
10% seems exploitive!

708
00:49:25,561 --> 00:49:27,562
That's not cricket!

709
00:49:32,368 --> 00:49:34,395
Oh, Jock...

710
00:49:37,873 --> 00:49:42,211
Jump! Oh, dear, sweet, resourceful Jock.

711
00:49:42,738 --> 00:49:44,046
It's my manservant.

712
00:49:44,146 --> 00:49:46,818
It appears he's requesting
my immediate self-defenestration.

713
00:49:52,305 --> 00:49:53,490
Balls!

714
00:49:55,157 --> 00:49:57,049
Forgive me, Vladimir.

715
00:50:00,696 --> 00:50:02,015
No balls.

716
00:50:05,801 --> 00:50:08,876
Thank you so much, Vladimir.

717
00:50:09,538 --> 00:50:11,574
Oh, I see...

718
00:50:12,742 --> 00:50:16,668
- Hello! I'm outside.
- Come on, sir.

719
00:50:16,768 --> 00:50:19,816
- I wish to use your telephone!
- Head toward the bike.

720
00:50:19,916 --> 00:50:22,752
Oh, I love motorcycles.
They're very fast.

721
00:50:22,852 --> 00:50:24,920
- Sir? Sir?
- What, Jock?

722
00:50:25,020 --> 00:50:26,897
Your trousers. It's a little unseemly.

723
00:50:26,997 --> 00:50:29,743
The trousers... Jock, you know,
it's entirely possible...

724
00:50:29,843 --> 00:50:31,453
- ...that I've bumped my head...
- You think?

725
00:50:31,553 --> 00:50:35,464
Have you heard the expression,
"Open your balls"?

726
00:50:35,564 --> 00:50:38,634
- No, sir.
- It made me feel dirty.

727
00:50:44,273 --> 00:50:46,292
Hang on, sir!

728
00:50:53,649 --> 00:50:55,771
Bloody good show, Jock!

729
00:50:55,951 --> 00:50:57,554
You really are a cut above!

730
00:50:59,422 --> 00:51:01,187
Where would you like to go, sir?

731
00:51:01,287 --> 00:51:06,562
The only safe ground is English soil.
To the Embassy, chop-chop.

732
00:51:07,506 --> 00:51:09,073
Jock?

733
00:51:10,099 --> 00:51:11,511
Keep your head down, sir!

734
00:51:14,704 --> 00:51:16,105
- Hang on, sir!
- Okay!

735
00:51:17,439 --> 00:51:18,507
- Jock?
- Yes, sir?

736
00:51:18,607 --> 00:51:21,678
- Will it be all right in the end?
- I couldn't say, sir!

737
00:51:30,719 --> 00:51:33,185
No, not the stairs!

738
00:51:39,094 --> 00:51:41,397
A bit of noise, sir!

739
00:51:42,297 --> 00:51:44,256
There we go!

740
00:51:56,746 --> 00:52:00,650
- Oh, it was dashed exhilarating.
- Where to, sir?

741
00:52:00,750 --> 00:52:02,752
Well, it was long ago,
and she was underage,

742
00:52:02,852 --> 00:52:04,987
but I do believe
the embassy is that way.

743
00:52:05,087 --> 00:52:07,600
- Right you are, sir.
- Right.

744
00:52:07,756 --> 00:52:09,458
- Jockie?
- Yes, sir?

745
00:52:09,658 --> 00:52:12,362
- "Open your balls"?
- I have no idea.

746
00:52:12,462 --> 00:52:16,201
Is it that you actually know
and don't want to tell me?

747
00:52:16,301 --> 00:52:17,333
Yes, sir.

748
00:52:20,168 --> 00:52:22,372
They've got him.
Ambassador's residence in Moscow.

749
00:52:22,472 --> 00:52:24,039
They're putting him
on the next flight to Heathrow.

750
00:52:24,139 --> 00:52:27,009
- Thank you.
- And his wife is on line six for you.

751
00:52:27,409 --> 00:52:29,467
Thank you!

752
00:52:30,679 --> 00:52:32,753
Thank you, Maurice.

753
00:52:33,182 --> 00:52:34,703
Maurice?

754
00:52:35,350 --> 00:52:36,786
Shut the door.

755
00:52:37,086 --> 00:52:38,592
Yes, sir.

756
00:52:41,357 --> 00:52:43,926
Hello, Johanna. We've found him.
He's on his way home.

757
00:52:44,414 --> 00:52:48,631
Thank heavens. This place is an absolute
mausoleum on one's own.

758
00:52:48,731 --> 00:52:51,200
- Do you feel unsafe?
- <i>A bit.</i>

759
00:52:51,300 --> 00:52:53,169
I could park outside for the night.

760
00:52:53,469 --> 00:52:56,772
Oh, I couldn't ask.
But how about tomorrow?

761
00:52:56,872 --> 00:52:59,475
Do come in, of course. Say, 8:00?

762
00:52:59,675 --> 00:53:01,944
You, me, and Charlie?

763
00:53:02,044 --> 00:53:05,818
Well, of course, Alastair. Wouldn't do,
the two of us here alone, would it?

764
00:53:07,216 --> 00:53:10,000
No, I suppose not. Still...

765
00:53:10,100 --> 00:53:12,593
if he can't make it, he can't make it.

766
00:53:13,355 --> 00:53:14,924
<i>May I bring anything?</i>

767
00:53:15,024 --> 00:53:16,692
Perhaps there is something
you could bring.

768
00:53:16,992 --> 00:53:18,160
A bottle of Chardonnay?

769
00:53:18,260 --> 00:53:20,627
A complete regimental listing
of the British 7th Army,

770
00:53:20,727 --> 00:53:23,228
2nd Division, June of 1945.

771
00:53:24,867 --> 00:53:27,542
- Very well, Johanna.
- <i>'Til tomorrow. Ta!</i>

772
00:53:31,574 --> 00:53:35,143
Well, maybe he won't
be able to make it.

773
00:53:49,592 --> 00:53:51,994
- Uppy, uppy, Jock!
- You are uppy, sir.

774
00:53:52,094 --> 00:53:55,130
Am I? Where are we?

775
00:53:55,497 --> 00:53:58,500
You should see the other fellow.

776
00:53:59,802 --> 00:54:01,970
The fact that you're as drunk
as a fiddler's bitch

777
00:54:02,070 --> 00:54:06,625
in no way obviates the fact that you very
nearly caused an international incident.

778
00:54:06,725 --> 00:54:11,007
A man your age has no excuse
for looking or behaving like a fugitive

779
00:54:11,107 --> 00:54:15,218
from a home for alcoholic
music hall artistes.

780
00:54:15,318 --> 00:54:17,970
I will have you know
that I am not an alcoholic.

781
00:54:18,070 --> 00:54:21,590
I am a drunk,
and there is a vast difference.

782
00:54:21,690 --> 00:54:25,094
In my defense,
I was not drinking until the plane.

783
00:54:25,194 --> 00:54:27,263
- And in the car, sir.
- And a bit in the car.

784
00:54:27,363 --> 00:54:32,301
- And the Ambassador's residence.
- And at the Ambassador's residence.

785
00:54:32,401 --> 00:54:36,972
The only advice I offer is you do not apply
to another of our embassies for help

786
00:54:37,072 --> 00:54:41,710
if and when you outrage the laws
of the United States, once you are there.

787
00:54:41,810 --> 00:54:44,313
Stop! Stop!

788
00:54:44,413 --> 00:54:47,516
Are you suggesting
that I go to the Colonies?

789
00:54:47,616 --> 00:54:50,353
Perish the vile thought.
I couldn't possibly.

790
00:54:50,453 --> 00:54:54,640
The sale of your Rolls-Royce to Krampf
will offer you a perfect cover.

791
00:54:54,740 --> 00:54:56,809
Find out if he's got that painting.

792
00:54:56,909 --> 00:54:59,662
Get behind the gates of his estate
and poke around a bit.

793
00:55:00,262 --> 00:55:03,566
The car has been loaded
upon a cargo flight to Los Angeles,

794
00:55:03,666 --> 00:55:07,002
and is halfway across the Atlantic.
You will follow.

795
00:55:07,102 --> 00:55:09,705
California? Oh, icky!

796
00:55:10,005 --> 00:55:14,043
Your bags have been packed and checked,
and your flight leaves... Now.

797
00:55:14,143 --> 00:55:16,261
On your feet, soldier.

798
00:55:17,546 --> 00:55:18,815
Hang on to me.

799
00:55:20,549 --> 00:55:24,987
I should like to ring my wife because
she's probably quite worried about me.

800
00:55:25,087 --> 00:55:29,667
Oh, don't worry about her.
I've been keeping her filled in.

801
00:55:31,293 --> 00:55:33,579
I say, old bean!

802
00:55:33,679 --> 00:55:35,831
Go to America and see Krampf.

803
00:55:35,931 --> 00:55:40,669
Do what it takes to bring the painting back,
and leave Johanna to me.

804
00:55:54,750 --> 00:55:58,270
Jock? Come here.

805
00:55:58,721 --> 00:56:00,095
I'm frightened.

806
00:56:00,195 --> 00:56:04,759
Do you think that Johanna is thawing
on the subject of the moustache?

807
00:56:09,131 --> 00:56:10,599
Hi.

808
00:56:10,699 --> 00:56:12,268
Hello.

809
00:56:14,603 --> 00:56:17,342
Sorry, there was a queue.

810
00:56:20,175 --> 00:56:22,144
Good God, man!

811
00:56:23,011 --> 00:56:26,302
Jockie! Focus, man!

812
00:56:26,402 --> 00:56:28,651
There are but five days to insolvency.

813
00:56:28,751 --> 00:56:31,587
- Two, sir.
- No, today's, what, Monday?

814
00:56:31,687 --> 00:56:35,157
- Thursday, sir.
- Well done. Carry on.

815
00:57:10,158 --> 00:57:13,529
Jock. Dear, sweet, sperm-heavy Jock.

816
00:57:13,629 --> 00:57:18,451
Behold this America, this new colossus,
this fair land of the free!

817
00:57:19,334 --> 00:57:22,404
What kind of hell-place is this?

818
00:57:23,338 --> 00:57:25,274
I feel as though
we've made a wrong turn

819
00:57:25,374 --> 00:57:27,610
and arrived on the set
of a pornographic film.

820
00:57:27,810 --> 00:57:31,714
Have we taken a wrong turn and arrived
on the set of a pornographic film?

821
00:57:33,115 --> 00:57:34,633
Checking in?

822
00:57:34,733 --> 00:57:38,421
I am Mortdecai, Lord of Silverdale.

823
00:57:38,521 --> 00:57:43,259
I should like to request a bucket of ice,
"Do Not Disturb" sign, and a bulldozer.

824
00:57:44,693 --> 00:57:47,433
- Checking in?
- Yeah, we're checking in.

825
00:57:47,930 --> 00:57:50,766
I suspect I may need to redecorate.

826
00:57:51,066 --> 00:57:53,202
Room 326, overlooks the pool.

827
00:57:54,002 --> 00:57:57,106
So all I must do is show up,

828
00:57:57,206 --> 00:57:59,908
and I'm presented with a credit card.

829
00:58:00,008 --> 00:58:02,911
No wonder your country's
in financial ruin.

830
00:58:03,011 --> 00:58:05,047
Do you need help with your bags?

831
00:58:05,147 --> 00:58:09,695
No, I do not need help with my bags.
I have a fucking manservant.

832
00:58:10,018 --> 00:58:11,620
Strange country.

833
00:58:22,731 --> 00:58:24,562
Hello.

834
00:58:29,938 --> 00:58:31,440
Hold it.

835
00:58:33,709 --> 00:58:35,221
Thanks.

836
00:58:37,679 --> 00:58:39,414
Hey.

837
00:58:39,514 --> 00:58:41,076
Hello...

838
00:58:57,099 --> 00:59:00,402
It's like listening
to bloody orangutans!

839
00:59:00,502 --> 00:59:03,005
Oh, really, why? Why?

840
00:59:09,611 --> 00:59:11,513
Hello, American?

841
00:59:11,613 --> 00:59:15,150
The rooms here are made of cement.
Very good in case of an air raid.

842
00:59:15,250 --> 00:59:17,152
But for those of us trying
to get a bit of rest

843
00:59:17,252 --> 00:59:20,489
after an arduous crossing,
a bit of an acoustic nightmare.

844
00:59:20,589 --> 00:59:23,492
So would you please stop
grunting like wildebeests

845
00:59:23,592 --> 00:59:26,796
and allow me to get some sleep, man?
Please! Please!

846
00:59:26,896 --> 00:59:29,665
<i>Sorry, sir. We'll try and keep it down.</i>

847
00:59:29,865 --> 00:59:33,935
Good God, Jock!
Put that thing away, man!

848
00:59:44,012 --> 00:59:45,545
Hello?

849
00:59:45,779 --> 00:59:49,451
Apple of my eye. The love of my life.

850
00:59:49,551 --> 00:59:52,287
Everything here makes me think of you.

851
00:59:52,487 --> 00:59:54,543
Who is this?

852
00:59:55,891 --> 01:00:00,312
It is I, your beloved.
Your husband, Charlie.

853
01:00:00,412 --> 01:00:01,864
Where are you?

854
01:00:01,964 --> 01:00:05,167
Oh, a terribly vulgar place
called Los Angeles.

855
01:00:05,267 --> 01:00:07,603
Apparently located
in the far West colonies.

856
01:00:07,703 --> 01:00:09,521
Well, what are you doing there?

857
01:00:09,621 --> 01:00:13,208
Well, I'm delivering the Rolls
to that grotesque Milton Krampf

858
01:00:13,308 --> 01:00:16,278
and retrieving a certain something
in the process.

859
01:00:16,378 --> 01:00:19,948
Stay away from Krampf's daughter.
She's a well-known nymphomaniac.

860
01:00:20,648 --> 01:00:23,051
Is she? How do you know such things?

861
01:00:23,151 --> 01:00:25,788
Johanna, we seem to be out of ice.
Should I send for some?

862
01:00:25,888 --> 01:00:27,656
It's my husband on the line.

863
01:00:27,756 --> 01:00:30,759
<i>Oh, is he still alive?
Has he got the painting yet?</i>

864
01:00:30,859 --> 01:00:33,729
- Is that Martland?
- I'll just be a moment, Alastair.

865
01:00:33,829 --> 01:00:37,965
That Judas! That Ajax! That Paris!
Or was it Agamemnon?

866
01:00:38,065 --> 01:00:40,120
Oh, you know who I mean.
That ghastly chap

867
01:00:40,220 --> 01:00:43,606
who stole Helen of Troy and started
all that nasty business in Greece.

868
01:00:47,595 --> 01:00:49,011
- Done!
- Finally!

869
01:00:49,111 --> 01:00:53,882
Charlie? Why are people achieving
climax in your immediate vicinity?

870
01:00:54,182 --> 01:00:59,221
Well, I think I'm staying in some
sort of cement brothel, my love.

871
01:00:59,521 --> 01:01:02,591
- Say that again.
- You look here, I will have you know

872
01:01:02,691 --> 01:01:06,862
that I too am capable of being desirable
to a certain type of woman!

873
01:01:06,962 --> 01:01:09,331
- Charlie!
- <i>Yes, oh, yes!</i>

874
01:01:09,431 --> 01:01:14,486
Some women go blind batting their lashes
for mustachioed men such as I!

875
01:01:14,586 --> 01:01:18,090
Charlie Mortdecai,
you are on very dangerous ground!

876
01:01:18,190 --> 01:01:20,609
Tell me the name
of that nympho daughter of Krampf's!

877
01:01:20,709 --> 01:01:23,546
Perhaps she would render
an opinion on the issue!

878
01:01:31,153 --> 01:01:35,223
Never mind. I've found a cold Latour
which we might enjoy...

879
01:01:36,358 --> 01:01:38,386
Johanna?

880
01:01:39,061 --> 01:01:40,330
Oh, balls.

881
01:01:41,330 --> 01:01:46,135
<i>Jock and I set off to deliver the Rolls
to my client, Milton Krampf.</i>

882
01:01:46,735 --> 01:01:49,638
<i>Ruthless billionaire, art collector,</i>

883
01:01:49,738 --> 01:01:54,076
<i>and the rumored possessor
of the lost Goya.</i>

884
01:01:54,176 --> 01:01:56,345
<i>I was hot on the scent,</i>

885
01:01:56,445 --> 01:02:00,482
<i>and a teensy bit curious
about his nympho daughter.</i>

886
01:02:07,455 --> 01:02:09,535
Yes... Right.

887
01:02:10,025 --> 01:02:13,596
We must secure the painting,
escape this nightmare posthaste

888
01:02:13,696 --> 01:02:15,597
and you should interrupt me
as soon as you can.

889
01:02:15,697 --> 01:02:16,916
Yes, sir.

890
01:02:22,971 --> 01:02:25,474
Lucky saddle.

891
01:02:27,275 --> 01:02:32,915
Yes! The fine life-giving
drinks tray manifests itself.

892
01:02:33,015 --> 01:02:36,351
- A mint julep, sir.
- Anything will do, I thank you.

893
01:02:36,451 --> 01:02:38,220
I'm Georgina Krampf.

894
01:02:38,320 --> 01:02:40,470
Oh! How do you do?

895
01:02:46,128 --> 01:02:47,463
You must be Mortdecai.

896
01:02:47,763 --> 01:02:51,533
Yes, indeed I am he.

897
01:02:52,634 --> 01:02:55,203
Are you not having
a little something to drink?

898
01:02:55,303 --> 01:02:58,741
No, I never drink alcohol.
I don't like to blunt my senses.

899
01:02:58,941 --> 01:03:00,909
How awful.

900
01:03:01,009 --> 01:03:03,029
Oh, I feel wonderful.

901
01:03:04,399 --> 01:03:06,223
Feel me.

902
01:03:06,715 --> 01:03:08,741
Feel? Oh.

903
01:03:09,951 --> 01:03:12,722
- Oh, yes.
- No, not there, stupid. Here.

904
01:03:17,426 --> 01:03:22,297
- Charlie Mortdecai, you son of a bitch...
- I was not squeezing the breasts...

905
01:03:24,232 --> 01:03:25,184
The Rolls.

906
01:03:51,693 --> 01:03:53,395
So, I was a mule!

907
01:03:53,495 --> 01:03:55,598
Right. You know, Bronwen called me
when she discovered the Goya,

908
01:03:55,698 --> 01:03:58,233
and I called Spinoza,
and then he arranged for everything,

909
01:03:58,333 --> 01:04:01,436
including the smuggling
of the painting in your Rolls.

910
01:04:01,536 --> 01:04:03,505
Yes, but someone found out
about the plan,

911
01:04:03,605 --> 01:04:07,509
and now Bronwen is as stiff
as my Uncle Richard's hatband.

912
01:04:07,609 --> 01:04:10,712
- Art restoring is a nasty business.
- You are a nasty business, sir.

913
01:04:10,812 --> 01:04:13,115
Just look at her. Isn't she a beauty?

914
01:04:13,215 --> 01:04:15,762
- Yes, she is.
- My God...

915
01:04:15,862 --> 01:04:17,853
- She's exquisite.
- So good...

916
01:04:17,953 --> 01:04:22,691
The expert brushstrokes,
the smooth lines...

917
01:04:22,791 --> 01:04:25,627
Doesn't she look like my mother?
Can you see a resemblance?

918
01:04:25,727 --> 01:04:27,462
I never met your mother.

919
01:04:27,562 --> 01:04:31,300
No, not in her, in me.
She's got prominent lips like me...

920
01:04:31,400 --> 01:04:34,127
and those far-searching eyes...
Don't you think so?

921
01:04:34,227 --> 01:04:36,138
Oh, yes. Do you mind?

922
01:04:39,174 --> 01:04:42,105
I was just looking for something...

923
01:04:42,805 --> 01:04:44,860
else.

924
01:04:47,415 --> 01:04:48,717
Okay.

925
01:04:48,917 --> 01:04:51,920
Branspath? Okay. Thank you so much.

926
01:04:52,020 --> 01:04:53,922
- In my study, please.
- Very good, sir.

927
01:04:54,022 --> 01:04:56,492
Thank you. No hard feelings.

928
01:04:56,592 --> 01:04:59,861
I hope you'll stay with me tonight.
I'm throwing a party.

929
01:04:59,961 --> 01:05:01,663
I'm gonna unveil the Duchess,

930
01:05:01,763 --> 01:05:06,001
and watch every art world snob
in town drool all over her.

931
01:05:06,101 --> 01:05:09,063
We'll have your things sent over
from the hotel. Go upstairs and freshen up.

932
01:05:09,163 --> 01:05:11,540
You smell like a horse!
And if you're quick about it,

933
01:05:11,640 --> 01:05:14,859
you might have time to couple
with Georgina before dinner.

934
01:05:14,959 --> 01:05:17,146
She's been through
half the staff already.

935
01:05:29,424 --> 01:05:31,360
Sir, you're staring at your liquor.

936
01:05:32,794 --> 01:05:34,963
So I am.

937
01:05:35,063 --> 01:05:39,067
Jock, I fear we are
in the eleventh hour, man.

938
01:05:39,367 --> 01:05:44,106
Our very future rests on getting
our hands on that blasted painting.

939
01:05:44,206 --> 01:05:47,943
And therefore it's imperative
that we devise a plan.

940
01:05:48,043 --> 01:05:50,812
And it will have to be
a fiendishly clever plan.

941
01:05:50,912 --> 01:05:54,182
- Well, sir... I've been thinking...
- And I mean dizzyingly complex,

942
01:05:54,282 --> 01:05:56,451
replete with feints and distractions

943
01:05:56,551 --> 01:05:59,593
and calibrated movements
of the Swiss watch type.

944
01:05:59,693 --> 01:06:01,822
What? Thoughts?

945
01:06:02,157 --> 01:06:05,200
During the party, we steal it
while no one's looking.

946
01:06:08,029 --> 01:06:11,065
Ingenious. Once again?

947
01:06:12,267 --> 01:06:16,004
You go down,
get your face seen a bit...

948
01:06:16,104 --> 01:06:19,124
then you meet me 'round the back later,
we climb up the side of the building,

949
01:06:19,224 --> 01:06:22,043
break through the window,
grab the painting.

950
01:06:22,510 --> 01:06:24,913
Oh, diabolical.

951
01:06:26,165 --> 01:06:27,910
Let's review it
a few more times, shall we?

952
01:06:28,010 --> 01:06:29,918
It's just the old
smash-and-grab routine, sir.

953
01:06:30,018 --> 01:06:34,522
Of course it is. This is just
the old smash-and-grab business.

954
01:06:34,622 --> 01:06:36,158
Smash-and-grab.

955
01:06:36,458 --> 01:06:38,226
- Jock?
- Yes, sir?

956
01:06:38,326 --> 01:06:40,729
- I am so very proud of you.
- Thank you, sir.

957
01:06:40,829 --> 01:06:42,129
- And, Jock?
- Yes, sir?

958
01:06:42,229 --> 01:06:44,666
- You know, I've always been fond of you.
- Thank you, sir.

959
01:06:44,766 --> 01:06:45,811
- Jock?
- Yup?

960
01:06:45,911 --> 01:06:49,417
- Will it be all right in the end?
- How the fuck should I know?

961
01:07:11,593 --> 01:07:13,394
Unremarkable.

962
01:07:21,069 --> 01:07:24,606
Keep the Englishman busy.
I create distraction.

963
01:07:24,706 --> 01:07:26,746
No problem.

964
01:07:40,521 --> 01:07:42,113
Hi.

965
01:07:43,825 --> 01:07:46,927
- That's my bottom.
- Dance with me.

966
01:07:47,862 --> 01:07:49,314
Starburst!

967
01:07:51,933 --> 01:07:53,802
Oh! So much! So much to look at!

968
01:07:59,607 --> 01:08:00,526
Have me.

969
01:08:00,626 --> 01:08:04,446
Oh, my dear, I'm so tired.
And so married and so tired.

970
01:08:04,546 --> 01:08:09,184
And so married... Oh!
And I'm married and tired, you know.

971
01:08:09,684 --> 01:08:11,053
I...

972
01:08:16,658 --> 01:08:19,995
Darling! Whatever brings you here?

973
01:08:20,395 --> 01:08:23,698
This is not a breast in my hand!

974
01:08:24,198 --> 01:08:28,611
I was unhappy with our last conversation,
so I got on the next plane. Surprised?

975
01:08:28,803 --> 01:08:31,573
Oh, pleasantly.

976
01:08:32,006 --> 01:08:34,042
Aren't you going to introduce us?

977
01:08:34,142 --> 01:08:37,812
Johanna, my dear,
this is Milton Krampf's nymph...

978
01:08:37,912 --> 01:08:39,814
Daughter Georgina.

979
01:08:39,914 --> 01:08:45,453
And she was, well, we were having
a discussion about three...

980
01:08:46,054 --> 01:08:49,057
Sometimes, you know, how it's like a...

981
01:08:56,998 --> 01:08:59,815
My, my, look at the time!

982
01:09:02,954 --> 01:09:04,206
Carry on!

983
01:09:12,480 --> 01:09:15,349
A beast... A beast...

984
01:09:19,421 --> 01:09:23,958
Yes, yes, yes. Good hungry doggie...

985
01:09:24,058 --> 01:09:26,667
Weenie, weenie, weenie, weenie...

986
01:09:26,767 --> 01:09:30,298
Weenie, weenie, weenie, weenie,
weenie, weenie, weenie...

987
01:09:40,808 --> 01:09:42,076
I met a beast...

988
01:09:42,176 --> 01:09:43,711
Krampf's window
is the second one on the left.

989
01:09:43,811 --> 01:09:47,582
- No, no. I met a beast!
- Get on that ladder!

990
01:09:47,882 --> 01:09:52,553
And what, pray tell, might you be doing
whilst I'm engaged in thus heroics?

991
01:09:53,087 --> 01:09:55,724
Beast! Beast! Beast...

992
01:10:01,095 --> 01:10:05,066
How I long for the rain
and indifference of Europe.

993
01:10:05,166 --> 01:10:08,136
- Well done, Jock!
- It's a privilege, sir!

994
01:10:20,415 --> 01:10:21,781
Well then, Mr. Krampf.

995
01:10:21,881 --> 01:10:25,547
I suppose since you're here
and I'm here,

996
01:10:25,647 --> 01:10:27,322
it's time for you and I to talk turkey.

997
01:10:38,600 --> 01:10:39,535
Oh, I see.

998
01:10:43,905 --> 01:10:45,831
Oh, I see.

999
01:10:47,409 --> 01:10:51,446
Bad news for you, Strago.
There are no bank codes on that painting.

1000
01:10:51,946 --> 01:10:56,117
I think we both know that there are.
Invisible ink, no?

1001
01:10:56,217 --> 01:10:57,875
Stop right there!

1002
01:10:58,353 --> 01:11:00,322
Sit down. Sit!

1003
01:11:00,422 --> 01:11:03,858
I... I warn you, Georgina. You have
no idea what you're getting involved with.

1004
01:11:03,958 --> 01:11:06,828
Despite his man purse,
Strago is very dangerous.

1005
01:11:06,928 --> 01:11:10,865
- Darling, they are in cahoots.
- How do you know?

1006
01:11:10,965 --> 01:11:13,542
Oh, that's gross!

1007
01:11:13,968 --> 01:11:15,537
We are in love.

1008
01:11:15,637 --> 01:11:17,339
Drop the gun!

1009
01:11:17,839 --> 01:11:18,940
Emil!

1010
01:11:19,040 --> 01:11:20,973
- Alastair!
- Do it now!

1011
01:11:28,216 --> 01:11:31,920
Good show, Martland!
Bit redundant, really, as he's dead.

1012
01:11:32,020 --> 01:11:35,189
- Alastair, what are you doing here?
- I followed you.

1013
01:11:35,289 --> 01:11:38,460
Wouldn't do to have you walking into all
this mess on your own, now, would it?

1014
01:11:38,560 --> 01:11:40,261
Jock, give me the painting.

1015
01:11:40,361 --> 01:11:43,331
- Sit down!
- Drop the knife! I will shoot you.

1016
01:11:43,431 --> 01:11:45,300
Yes, most likely by accident.

1017
01:11:45,400 --> 01:11:48,403
None of you will ever know what it's like
to make love to a man with principles.

1018
01:11:48,503 --> 01:11:50,973
Well, in my case,
I can safely say you are correct.

1019
01:11:51,073 --> 01:11:54,042
However, I never went to Eton
where buggery is rampant.

1020
01:11:54,142 --> 01:11:55,910
Oh, you were at Eton,
weren't you, Martland?

1021
01:11:56,010 --> 01:11:58,914
Yes, yes, I was. Yes, I was!

1022
01:12:10,792 --> 01:12:13,311
Please don't be sick!
Please don't be sick!

1023
01:12:13,961 --> 01:12:15,330
It's the shellfish!

1024
01:12:16,631 --> 01:12:18,600
- You have it? Do you have it?
- Go! Go!

1025
01:12:18,700 --> 01:12:21,242
I go, I go, I go!

1026
01:12:22,003 --> 01:12:23,059
Valet!

1027
01:12:23,738 --> 01:12:26,708
- Oh, I don't like that. I don't like it.
- Close your eyes, sir.

1028
01:12:26,808 --> 01:12:30,165
- Give me the keys. Keys to the Rolls.
- Come on, let's go.

1029
01:12:30,265 --> 01:12:32,314
Well, at least none of us
had the shellfish.

1030
01:12:38,152 --> 01:12:40,202
Jock, please!

1031
01:12:40,988 --> 01:12:43,124
My sympathetic gag reflex.

1032
01:12:43,224 --> 01:12:47,229
Have you lost your bearings, man?
Shellfish at a catered affair?

1033
01:12:57,639 --> 01:13:01,776
I will have you two know that I had a firm
grasp on things before you showed up.

1034
01:13:01,876 --> 01:13:04,412
You certainly had
a firm grasp on something!

1035
01:13:04,512 --> 01:13:07,215
You dare to cast aspersions?

1036
01:13:07,315 --> 01:13:11,353
I am not the one entertaining
at all hours with a failed poet!

1037
01:13:19,227 --> 01:13:21,696
At least my focus at university
wasn't plagiarism!

1038
01:13:21,796 --> 01:13:23,855
Oh, stay out of it!

1039
01:13:27,468 --> 01:13:30,905
Oh, I've got a sensitive tummy!
There's more, there's more, there's more.

1040
01:13:31,005 --> 01:13:33,541
- No more, no more, no more.
- I swallowed it.

1041
01:13:35,477 --> 01:13:37,912
At least I have the good taste
to hide my indiscretions

1042
01:13:38,012 --> 01:13:39,847
and not parade them
under everyone's nose!

1043
01:13:39,947 --> 01:13:42,850
- So you admit there were indiscretions?
- I admit nothing!

1044
01:13:42,950 --> 01:13:44,953
- Then I deny nothing.
- Oh, shut up!

1045
01:14:00,234 --> 01:14:03,471
Questionable attack, Jock.
Spirited, though.

1046
01:14:03,971 --> 01:14:05,006
I'm done.

1047
01:14:40,007 --> 01:14:41,632
- There's their car!
- Where?

1048
01:14:41,732 --> 01:14:43,237
There!

1049
01:14:45,947 --> 01:14:50,190
Now we wait. Thirty seconds.
Twenty-nine...

1050
01:14:50,290 --> 01:14:52,820
- Twenty-eight...
- Don't count.

1051
01:14:58,660 --> 01:15:01,666
Better out than in. All right.

1052
01:15:02,830 --> 01:15:04,799
I shall secure the perimeter.

1053
01:15:04,899 --> 01:15:07,802
Why, this is an outrage!
There's not an ocean vista

1054
01:15:07,902 --> 01:15:10,672
- within miles of this establishment.
- Please don't be tiresome. Jock!

1055
01:15:10,772 --> 01:15:14,442
Are you quite finished
with your barrage of insults?

1056
01:15:18,112 --> 01:15:22,650
Now we heat the surface,
reveal the codes and transfer the money.

1057
01:15:22,750 --> 01:15:24,807
Get the blowtorch.

1058
01:15:45,306 --> 01:15:47,041
Nobody make a move.

1059
01:15:47,141 --> 01:15:51,045
I really wouldn't, you know,
he's trained and sexually frustrated.

1060
01:15:51,145 --> 01:15:54,415
Those bank codes won't fall
into the wrong hands again.

1061
01:15:54,515 --> 01:15:56,621
- Back away from the painting.
- Oh, don't do that!

1062
01:15:56,721 --> 01:15:58,653
- For heaven's sake.
- For England!

1063
01:16:05,026 --> 01:16:06,526
Oh, dear.

1064
01:16:08,412 --> 01:16:10,973
- Everyone out!
- Okay.

1065
01:16:22,343 --> 01:16:25,313
<i>The local authorities were displeased.</i>

1066
01:16:25,413 --> 01:16:27,014
<i>Strago and Georgina fled,</i>

1067
01:16:27,114 --> 01:16:31,152
<i>leaving the rest of us to answer
some rather pointed questions.</i>

1068
01:16:31,252 --> 01:16:34,439
<i>I recounted the sordid tale
as best I could...</i>

1069
01:16:34,539 --> 01:16:38,660
This may be a customary greeting
in America. I don't know.

1070
01:16:39,260 --> 01:16:43,097
<i>All the while,
my thoughts were only of home.</i>

1071
01:16:43,197 --> 01:16:48,035
<i>If indeed Johanna and I
still had a home to go to.</i>

1072
01:16:55,943 --> 01:16:59,207
I'm not sure if Jock has mentioned it,

1073
01:16:59,307 --> 01:17:03,484
but I am very, very sorry
about everything.

1074
01:17:03,584 --> 01:17:07,087
Darling? Please?

1075
01:17:11,959 --> 01:17:17,431
I suppose that we will have
to open the house to tours.

1076
01:17:17,531 --> 01:17:20,601
I'll have Jock fix up
the servants quarters for us.

1077
01:17:20,701 --> 01:17:25,673
Do you think that Jockie will stay on
without pay or lodging?

1078
01:17:25,773 --> 01:17:29,727
Don't be daft. This isn't finished yet.

1079
01:17:29,827 --> 01:17:33,714
That painting was a fake.
A fake? How do you know?

1080
01:17:33,814 --> 01:17:35,961
A chap called Bunny's got the real one.

1081
01:17:36,061 --> 01:17:38,252
- Bunny?
- Bronwen lied from the start.

1082
01:17:38,652 --> 01:17:43,124
She never found the lost Goya.
She painted it.

1083
01:17:43,224 --> 01:17:44,259
Of course!

1084
01:17:44,659 --> 01:17:47,562
<i>Bronwen makes a fake, and calls Krampf.</i>

1085
01:17:47,662 --> 01:17:51,179
Am I interested? I'm wildly interested.

1086
01:17:51,279 --> 01:17:53,401
<i>Krampf calls Spinoza.</i>

1087
01:17:53,501 --> 01:17:55,931
<i>Georgina finds out about it
and tells Emil,</i>

1088
01:17:56,031 --> 01:17:58,172
<i>who goes to steal the painting
from Bronwen.</i>

1089
01:17:58,272 --> 01:18:00,274
<i>But Spinoza's already there.</i>

1090
01:18:00,374 --> 01:18:03,411
<i>He boffs Emil on the bean
and takes the painting.</i>

1091
01:18:03,611 --> 01:18:07,081
<i>Spinoza then secrets
the painting into the Rolls</i>

1092
01:18:07,181 --> 01:18:11,052
<i>and I unwittingly smuggle it to Krampf.</i>

1093
01:18:11,152 --> 01:18:14,755
The Duke told me that Bunny
has the painting, but I can't find him.

1094
01:18:14,855 --> 01:18:18,993
- Which Duke?
- Of Asherboroughdon. Bronwen's lover.

1095
01:18:19,093 --> 01:18:20,595
Bunny.

1096
01:18:20,695 --> 01:18:23,731
"Love, your Bunny!"
Oh! The note in the studio.

1097
01:18:23,831 --> 01:18:26,200
It was not from a child,
it was from him.

1098
01:18:26,300 --> 01:18:29,437
The Duke is Bunny.

1099
01:18:29,637 --> 01:18:32,769
- And it wasn't his tadger.
- Come again?

1100
01:18:32,869 --> 01:18:35,343
The Duke kept trying to get me
to go into his lavatory

1101
01:18:35,443 --> 01:18:38,345
- to look at his John Thomas.
- Oh. Randy bugger.

1102
01:18:38,445 --> 01:18:41,816
Only that wasn't it at all! He was trying
to show me the real painting.

1103
01:18:42,316 --> 01:18:45,907
The Duchess of Wellington
is in Bunny's loo.

1104
01:19:02,203 --> 01:19:04,756
- Oh, my.
- Oh, my.

1105
01:19:06,173 --> 01:19:09,743
- Oh, my.
- Oh, my!

1106
01:19:10,878 --> 01:19:12,530
- Oh, my.
- Oh, my.

1107
01:19:15,182 --> 01:19:19,396
Well, the water bailiff
won't bother him now.

1108
01:19:20,688 --> 01:19:24,692
- Terribly sorry for your loss, madam.
- How very kind.

1109
01:19:26,193 --> 01:19:28,763
Would you mind ever so much
if we used the lavatory?

1110
01:19:30,698 --> 01:19:33,063
It's this way.

1111
01:19:38,506 --> 01:19:41,303
Oh, you beautiful breadwinner.

1112
01:19:42,443 --> 01:19:45,980
- Darling, please, you are killing me.
- Right.

1113
01:19:47,047 --> 01:19:50,751
- Out the window with it?
- Quite.

1114
01:19:51,985 --> 01:19:53,851
However...

1115
01:19:54,488 --> 01:19:57,959
I do have the slightest of queries.

1116
01:19:58,059 --> 01:20:00,127
What do we do next?

1117
01:20:01,094 --> 01:20:03,197
Because if Martland should get
his grubby hands on that painting,

1118
01:20:03,297 --> 01:20:07,869
he would destroy a magnificent work of art.
And we will be out a finder's fee.

1119
01:20:07,969 --> 01:20:10,171
If it falls into Strago's hands,

1120
01:20:10,271 --> 01:20:15,142
he will unleash his unpleasantness
to disastrous effect upon the world.

1121
01:20:15,242 --> 01:20:19,713
And if we try to sell it to Romanov,
he will kill us and simply take it instead.

1122
01:20:19,813 --> 01:20:23,818
And yet we must find a way to pay
eight million in back taxes.

1123
01:20:23,918 --> 01:20:28,021
Quite, quite, yes, indeed, quite.

1124
01:20:28,121 --> 01:20:31,892
Quite a conundrum, this. I shall need
a moment to think this through, I'm afraid.

1125
01:20:31,992 --> 01:20:34,078
Yes, do. Do think.

1126
01:20:34,178 --> 01:20:37,533
Just bear in mind, I'm standing on a loo,
holding a dead man's Goya.

1127
01:20:38,933 --> 01:20:42,436
Our painting is entered in Sedgwick's
Friday auction, is it not?

1128
01:20:42,936 --> 01:20:45,740
- Yes.
- Perfect.

1129
01:20:45,840 --> 01:20:49,977
We are going to enter the Goya into
the auction, disguised as our Sheridan.

1130
01:20:50,277 --> 01:20:53,314
But it's already at Sedgwick's.
It's been authenticated.

1131
01:20:53,614 --> 01:20:55,483
We'll make a switch.

1132
01:20:55,583 --> 01:20:59,854
But first we must convince our buyers
that the Goya's back in play.

1133
01:20:59,954 --> 01:21:03,297
They won't take our word for it.
They'll want to see it themselves.

1134
01:21:03,397 --> 01:21:05,059
Then we'll show it to them.

1135
01:21:05,759 --> 01:21:10,364
<i>What the situation requires now
is a well-spun rumor.</i>

1136
01:21:10,464 --> 01:21:12,799
Sir Graham. A message for you, sir.

1137
01:21:15,269 --> 01:21:17,805
What is all this nonsense?

1138
01:21:17,905 --> 01:21:21,675
You know I'm not interested
in your flaccid Sheridan.

1139
01:21:21,775 --> 01:21:23,467
Darling?

1140
01:21:29,190 --> 01:21:31,273
Interested now?

1141
01:21:31,373 --> 01:21:33,127
Very.

1142
01:21:33,520 --> 01:21:37,124
- But I watched it burn.
- It's Mortdecai, sir.

1143
01:21:37,224 --> 01:21:41,257
Chatter is he's found a dashedly
clever way to move it on the open market.

1144
01:21:42,430 --> 01:21:46,343
- The auction starts at 5:00 p.m.
- I want that painting.

1145
01:21:46,700 --> 01:21:48,737
The auction got it.

1146
01:21:50,203 --> 01:21:51,272
Good luck!

1147
01:22:02,550 --> 01:22:06,620
I believe he still owes me a finger.

1148
01:22:17,631 --> 01:22:19,400
- Hello, pookie.
- Hello, darling.

1149
01:22:19,800 --> 01:22:23,471
- I nicked one of their passkeys.
- Well done. We're Lot Seven.

1150
01:22:23,571 --> 01:22:27,122
I shall need 30 seconds to make the switch
once it's announced. Do not delay.

1151
01:22:27,222 --> 01:22:31,245
I know this building like the back
of my hand. You will have your time.

1152
01:22:32,446 --> 01:22:34,449
Good luck.

1153
01:22:49,964 --> 01:22:51,765
Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.

1154
01:22:51,865 --> 01:22:55,265
Welcome to Sedgwick's
Autumn Master's Sale.

1155
01:22:55,365 --> 01:22:58,973
We shall begin with Lot One.

1156
01:22:59,073 --> 01:23:01,442
Barnyard Friends.
A lovely Helen Allingham,

1157
01:23:01,542 --> 01:23:05,679
depicting two horses,
an ass, and several cocks.

1158
01:23:05,779 --> 01:23:07,681
There's a lovely sky here.

1159
01:23:07,781 --> 01:23:11,385
Shall we start the bidding
at 17,000 pounds?

1160
01:23:11,485 --> 01:23:13,721
Seventeen thousand pounds,
thank you very much.

1161
01:23:19,393 --> 01:23:22,400
Stealthy, man, stealthy.

1162
01:23:23,464 --> 01:23:25,999
Like a jungle cat.

1163
01:23:28,502 --> 01:23:31,004
Hello, Vladimir. So good
to see you out and about.

1164
01:23:31,104 --> 01:23:33,874
Tell us where painting is,
or you have big hole in your head.

1165
01:23:33,974 --> 01:23:35,877
You will have hole in your balls!

1166
01:23:38,212 --> 01:23:40,415
Why is Dmitri obsessed with testicula?

1167
01:23:45,452 --> 01:23:50,558
Your mother and father only met once.
And money changed hands.

1168
01:23:51,859 --> 01:23:54,562
Probably less than a 20.

1169
01:23:54,762 --> 01:23:57,999
And they say she was dressed
as a man at the time.

1170
01:23:58,199 --> 01:24:00,714
I wouldn't, mate.

1171
01:24:01,214 --> 01:24:02,410
I really wouldn't.

1172
01:24:03,170 --> 01:24:06,173
Sold to the gentleman
in the fuchsia ascot.

1173
01:24:06,473 --> 01:24:08,409
Moving on to Lot Two.

1174
01:24:08,509 --> 01:24:13,214
All right. There. You won't be
needing this anymore, will you? Will you?

1175
01:24:17,885 --> 01:24:19,487
My God.

1176
01:24:20,521 --> 01:24:23,190
Oh, dash it all, Jock, man, your hand!

1177
01:24:24,225 --> 01:24:26,093
It's all right, sir, I've got another.

1178
01:24:26,193 --> 01:24:28,862
You know, remarkably, this is not
the first time I've shot Jock.

1179
01:24:28,962 --> 01:24:31,365
Sir, the switch. The switch, sir.

1180
01:24:31,465 --> 01:24:34,602
Oh, quite right. No time to dally.

1181
01:24:46,480 --> 01:24:48,515
I'll meet you inside, sir.

1182
01:24:48,615 --> 01:24:51,252
And we move on to Lot Four.

1183
01:24:51,352 --> 01:24:55,089
Fernand Just Quignon's Lavender Field.

1184
01:24:55,989 --> 01:24:57,358
Isn't it charming?

1185
01:25:24,017 --> 01:25:26,621
Thirty-five thousand pounds...

1186
01:25:28,989 --> 01:25:32,893
Forty thousand pounds?
40,000? 45, isn't it?

1187
01:25:32,993 --> 01:25:36,597
Forty-five, thank you, sir.
45, 50, back on the...

1188
01:25:42,803 --> 01:25:43,971
Give me the painting.

1189
01:25:51,144 --> 01:25:53,155
What painting?

1190
01:25:55,849 --> 01:25:59,787
I see that you have been schooled
in the... fine art of fencing.

1191
01:26:01,355 --> 01:26:03,162
Alas,

1192
01:26:04,825 --> 01:26:06,080
so have I.

1193
01:26:07,561 --> 01:26:09,997
An essential part
of every gentleman's education.

1194
01:26:11,665 --> 01:26:13,060
And as a gentleman,

1195
01:26:13,160 --> 01:26:15,988
I should warn you...
that my coup d'arret

1196
01:26:16,088 --> 01:26:20,107
is still whispered about
in hushed tones to this very day.

1197
01:26:22,476 --> 01:26:25,545
I don't like it, I don't like it,
I don't like it, I don't like it!

1198
01:26:27,248 --> 01:26:29,850
Twenty-five thousand pounds.

1199
01:26:39,093 --> 01:26:43,097
Lot Five. Smiling Woman in a Chair.

1200
01:26:55,042 --> 01:26:58,746
Sold for 210,000 pounds.

1201
01:27:03,083 --> 01:27:06,520
<i>And now, moving on to Lot Six.</i>

1202
01:27:33,980 --> 01:27:35,794
Oh, dear.

1203
01:27:44,891 --> 01:27:48,846
I would like to humbly
and unreservedly offer my deepest...

1204
01:27:51,998 --> 01:27:53,362
Truce?

1205
01:27:58,138 --> 01:28:01,175
Ladies and gentlemen,
if you would please remain calm.

1206
01:28:13,754 --> 01:28:17,324
Ladies and gentlemen, if you would please
remain in your seats, I would be grateful.

1207
01:28:27,267 --> 01:28:29,777
Where is Mortdecai?

1208
01:28:30,203 --> 01:28:31,772
Well, come on, then.

1209
01:28:55,262 --> 01:28:56,849
God.

1210
01:28:59,132 --> 01:29:02,334
Going on to Lot Seven.

1211
01:29:02,434 --> 01:29:06,541
- Colonel Blucher with Hounds near Twineham.
- But quietly. Quietly.

1212
01:29:07,741 --> 01:29:11,044
A lovely Sheridan offered
by the Mortdecai estate.

1213
01:29:11,144 --> 01:29:14,692
Shall we start the bidding
at 100,000 pounds?

1214
01:29:15,583 --> 01:29:18,018
One hundred thousand pounds.
Thank you, Sir Graham.

1215
01:29:19,786 --> 01:29:21,822
Fang wants finger.

1216
01:29:21,922 --> 01:29:24,958
Must go and bid. Must go and bid.
Must go and bid.

1217
01:29:27,761 --> 01:29:30,998
Where is Mortdecai? Tell me.

1218
01:29:31,098 --> 01:29:34,101
He's not here, mate. He sent me.

1219
01:29:35,202 --> 01:29:38,972
- Where is he?
- It's just me, mate.

1220
01:29:39,072 --> 01:29:40,541
Oh, God!

1221
01:29:41,408 --> 01:29:43,677
Dear, sweet, heroic Jock.

1222
01:29:44,377 --> 01:29:46,613
Two hundred. Very good.
Do we have three?

1223
01:29:47,193 --> 01:29:48,215
Three.

1224
01:29:48,315 --> 01:29:51,351
Yes, well, in future, if you could
please use your paddles.

1225
01:29:51,551 --> 01:29:54,588
I will take your finger.

1226
01:30:13,407 --> 01:30:18,746
I couldn't help overhearing
some discussion about your finger.

1227
01:30:19,046 --> 01:30:21,682
Oh, don't worry about that, sir,
I've got nine more.

1228
01:30:25,486 --> 01:30:28,021
I feel simply awful, man,
but I must get to the auction.

1229
01:30:28,221 --> 01:30:32,165
- I'll be all right, sir.
- We need eight million.

1230
01:30:33,727 --> 01:30:36,830
Now, can we go to 500?
500, ladies and gentlemen.

1231
01:30:36,930 --> 01:30:39,900
There he is. Now don't cause a panic.
Just get him.

1232
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:43,203
Five hundred thousand.
Five hundred thousand.

1233
01:30:43,303 --> 01:30:46,540
- Hold. Hold.
- Thank you, madam, 500,000.

1234
01:30:46,640 --> 01:30:49,576
Do I have 600? 600,000 pounds,
ladies and gentlemen.

1235
01:30:49,676 --> 01:30:51,545
- Bid.
- What?

1236
01:30:52,446 --> 01:30:56,483
A bid from Lady Mortdecai, who seems
to be bidding on her own painting.

1237
01:30:56,583 --> 01:30:59,786
Just taking the horse for a trot out
to London and back, are we?

1238
01:30:59,886 --> 01:31:02,156
- Yeah.
- Very well. 600 then.

1239
01:31:02,556 --> 01:31:04,391
I'll make it up to you, Jockie.

1240
01:31:04,491 --> 01:31:06,727
Oh, I know you will, sir.
You always do.

1241
01:31:31,084 --> 01:31:32,866
Well done, sir.

1242
01:31:36,089 --> 01:31:39,125
It is a privilege, Jock.

1243
01:31:39,326 --> 01:31:41,729
<i>Are we all done at 900,000?</i>

1244
01:31:42,429 --> 01:31:43,997
Go bid!

1245
01:31:44,397 --> 01:31:48,234
<i>Fair warning at 900,000 pounds...</i>

1246
01:31:48,334 --> 01:31:50,398
from Sir Graham.

1247
01:31:51,104 --> 01:31:53,229
Last chance.

1248
01:31:53,329 --> 01:31:56,043
- And we are...
- Darling.

1249
01:31:58,044 --> 01:32:02,749
Yes, Lord Mortdecai?
Would you also like to make a bid?

1250
01:32:03,316 --> 01:32:05,252
Ten million pounds.

1251
01:32:05,352 --> 01:32:09,922
Ten million pounds
from Lord Mortdecai himself.

1252
01:32:11,792 --> 01:32:13,126
Move!

1253
01:32:13,226 --> 01:32:16,163
Come on! Twenty million, you swine!

1254
01:32:16,263 --> 01:32:17,731
Twenty-five million.

1255
01:32:17,831 --> 01:32:20,934
Twenty-five and a half!
26 and a quarter!

1256
01:32:21,034 --> 01:32:24,104
- Thirty million. Final offer!
- Is that our final bid?

1257
01:32:24,204 --> 01:32:28,675
Are we all done at 30 million pounds?

1258
01:32:29,642 --> 01:32:31,463
Sold.

1259
01:32:34,581 --> 01:32:37,818
There you are. 2,642 pounds.

1260
01:32:39,786 --> 01:32:42,068
I do beg your pardon.

1261
01:32:42,168 --> 01:32:44,657
Maths were never my strong suit.

1262
01:32:44,757 --> 01:32:48,129
But there was mention of 30 million,
so you take that.

1263
01:32:48,729 --> 01:32:51,765
Less commission, carrying,
handling, and transfer taxes,

1264
01:32:51,865 --> 01:32:54,401
left a total of just over
eight million pounds.

1265
01:32:54,501 --> 01:32:56,603
Which I am sorry to report has been...

1266
01:32:56,703 --> 01:33:02,792
Garnished by Her Majesty's government
in settlement of your tax bill, Charlie.

1267
01:33:03,944 --> 01:33:07,081
Can you think of a good reason
why I shouldn't arrest you right now?

1268
01:33:08,381 --> 01:33:09,850
I eschew discomfort?

1269
01:33:11,051 --> 01:33:12,987
Any blame here should fall on me.

1270
01:33:14,087 --> 01:33:16,089
Dear Alastair,

1271
01:33:16,189 --> 01:33:18,258
if I led you to believe
there was anything between us,

1272
01:33:18,358 --> 01:33:22,162
it was merely to find out
about the case and protect my husband.

1273
01:33:22,262 --> 01:33:23,897
Can you forgive me?

1274
01:33:23,997 --> 01:33:26,064
Of course, Johanna.

1275
01:33:26,783 --> 01:33:28,656
Charlie?

1276
01:33:31,371 --> 01:33:34,456
It was a damned good try, old bean.

1277
01:33:38,812 --> 01:33:41,248
"Of all sad words of tongue or pen,

1278
01:33:41,348 --> 01:33:45,184
"the saddest are these,
'It might have been'."

1279
01:33:45,652 --> 01:33:47,657
Thank you, Maurice.

1280
01:33:57,397 --> 01:34:02,202
<i>Poor Jock. He was frantic with worry.</i>

1281
01:34:02,302 --> 01:34:06,539
<i>But I knew everything
would be all right in the end.</i>

1282
01:34:10,143 --> 01:34:12,240
<i>Magnificent.</i>

1283
01:34:14,247 --> 01:34:16,616
Do you think the codes
are really there?

1284
01:34:16,716 --> 01:34:20,987
They most certainly are, darling.
And I gave them to the authorities.

1285
01:34:21,087 --> 01:34:24,057
Anonymously, of course.

1286
01:34:24,157 --> 01:34:29,196
We may be flat broke, my darling,
but we are not desperate.

1287
01:34:29,296 --> 01:34:32,699
I do hope Romanov doesn't come down
too hard on Sir Graham,

1288
01:34:32,799 --> 01:34:35,902
when he finds out
he bought the wrong fake.

1289
01:34:36,302 --> 01:34:38,156
Lights.

1290
01:34:44,410 --> 01:34:46,847
That is disappointing.

1291
01:34:46,947 --> 01:34:48,849
Very disappointing.

1292
01:34:48,949 --> 01:34:51,393
Open your balls.

1293
01:34:55,421 --> 01:34:56,452
Bollocks.

1294
01:34:57,791 --> 01:34:59,803
Now...

1295
01:34:59,903 --> 01:35:03,504
tell me about that tramp on the horse.

1296
01:35:04,297 --> 01:35:10,737
Oh, my darling, I tried desperately
to be unfaithful to you, I really did.

1297
01:35:11,104 --> 01:35:12,873
But I just couldn't do it.

1298
01:35:14,674 --> 01:35:17,010
It's a terrible moment
when you find yourself

1299
01:35:17,110 --> 01:35:20,414
falling in love
with your own spouse, isn't it?

1300
01:35:20,514 --> 01:35:23,049
Now, that is the look that softens

1301
01:35:23,149 --> 01:35:27,154
every bone in my body, except one.

1302
01:35:29,255 --> 01:35:32,159
Do you mean you are ready?

1303
01:35:33,627 --> 01:35:35,762
I see no obstacle to such a course.

1304
01:35:39,499 --> 01:35:43,737
My love, surely you recall
I have already been circumcised.

1305
01:35:48,842 --> 01:35:50,271
Charlie?

1306
01:35:51,244 --> 01:35:54,414
Mrs. Mortdecai, as you well know,

1307
01:35:54,814 --> 01:35:58,851
I am a man of few words.

1308
01:36:00,486 --> 01:36:04,957
I deeply, deeply love...

1309
01:36:05,492 --> 01:36:07,027
my moustache.

1310
01:36:09,429 --> 01:36:12,038
But... I have discovered...

1311
01:36:13,333 --> 01:36:15,839
that I love you...

1312
01:36:16,703 --> 01:36:17,771
more.

1313
01:36:21,074 --> 01:36:22,054
Proceed.

1314
01:36:25,512 --> 01:36:28,581
Would you really do that for me?

1315
01:36:29,082 --> 01:36:31,167
For you,

1316
01:36:31,267 --> 01:36:34,791
there is nothing I would not do.

1317
01:36:38,124 --> 01:36:41,328
Well, in that case, Mr. Mortdecai,

1318
01:36:41,428 --> 01:36:45,199
I should be very pleased
if you would keep it.

1319
01:36:46,266 --> 01:36:48,134
Really?

1320
01:36:48,234 --> 01:36:50,237
I mean...

1321
01:36:51,604 --> 01:36:54,207
Oh, darl...

1322
01:36:54,307 --> 01:36:56,776
Your gag reflex.

1323
01:36:56,876 --> 01:36:58,872
Try me.

1324
01:37:09,355 --> 01:37:11,091
Pookie.

1325
01:37:11,174 --> 01:37:14,414
I have never been so...
