00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:56,162
Yeah. They argue a lot.

164
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:58,201
Huh.

165
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:03,442
You look like you got hit or something.

166
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:09,482
Yeah, yeah, I got hit with
a football in gym class.

167
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:12,570
Yeah, that can happen.

168
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:15,500
Yeah.

169
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:18,121
SPENCER: No, no, you're right,
you're right. Let's talk to him.

170
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:21,290
Hi, great, okay.

171
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:23,740
David, we're very happy
to have you here.

172
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:26,580
I'm gonna have a beer before dinner.
Can I offer you one?

173
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:29,220
- Well, no, thank you.
- No. Okay. Suit yourself.

174
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:31,020
And dinner is gonna be ready in an hour.

175
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:33,482
So, Luke, why don't
you do some homework.

176
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:36,380
Okay.

177
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:37,660
David, can I get you anything?

178
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:40,247
Oh, no, thank you,
Mrs. Peterson, I'm fine.

179
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:45,166
ZEKE: Yeah, hit this.

180
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:48,260
- (SCREAMS)
- Look out... Shit.

181
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:49,380
(LAUGHING)

182
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:51,580
- No...

184
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:57,364

- No, I'm good, but thank you.

(SIGHS)

186
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:04,801
So, that friend of your brother's,
is he sticking around?

187
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:06,900
I don't know. I hope not. (SIGHS)

188
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,884
Why? You said you liked him.

189
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:11,851
I said he seemed nice.
That's not the same thing.

190
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:13,561
Oh, okay.

191
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:16,411
Why don't you like him?

192
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:18,730
I don't not like him.

193
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:21,166
It's just, I... (CHUCKLES)

194
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:24,243
I mean, you kind of knew Caleb.

196
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,440
We've all...

197
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:35,886
I just know Mom and Dad
have been trying to move on

198
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:38,940
and it's not like they don't have
enough reminders in this town.

199
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:40,241
Yeah.

200
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:41,540
(SNIFFS)

201
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:43,220
I don't know,
that seems pretty normal to me.

202
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:45,966
You know, like, your kid dies.
That's hard.

203
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:50,444
Yeah. (SIGHS)

204
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:53,700
Guess we just don't need a walking,
breathing reminder

205
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:55,740
of him right now, you know?

206
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:57,451
(EXHALES)

207
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:00,286
Yeah. Totally.

208
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:04,804
I've got to go. (GRUNTS)

209
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:10,340
Hey, wait a second. Wait a second.

210
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:11,580
- Stop. I can't...
- What!

211
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:13,860
No, no. Let's just hang out,
like, a little bit longer.

212
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:15,140
- I can't.
- Just a little bit longer.

213
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:16,460
I can't. Mmm-mmm. I have to go.

214
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:18,569
- You don't have to go.
- Yes, I do.

215
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:21,220
But I'm sure we can find some
time at Kristen's tomorrow, okay?

216
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:23,045
Hmm.

217
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:28,485
Stop, I have to go.

218
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:31,340
(EXHALES)

219
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:34,020
The sine is the angle of
the ship's anchor cable,

220
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:36,820
so the cable is the hypotenuse,
and what we need to find out

221
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:39,043
is the distance down
to the ocean bottom,

222
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:42,126
so that's the opposite. Do you see?

223
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:45,540
Not really.

224
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:47,046
(CHUCKLING)

225
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:51,805
So, you're kind of smart, huh?

226
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:56,685
(STAMMERING) I guess so.

227
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:02,044
Hey, how was work?

228
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:04,140
Good. Not too busy.

229
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:06,020
David, sure I can't get you a beer?

230
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:08,300
You know, I will have one. Thank you.

231
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:10,140
- I'll take one, too.
- SPENCER: Yeah, I'm sure you will.

232
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:11,500
I'm 21 in a month.

233
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:12,940
You can have all the beer you want then,

234
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:15,242
- assuming you buy it yourself.

00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:25,562
Well, not exactly. (CHUCKLES)

237
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:31,766
Hey, don't go.
Stick around, be sociable.

238
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:34,208
Ugh, I'm kind of tired.
I think I'm gonna lay down.

239
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:36,690
SPENCER: Okay. Suit yourself.

240
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:45,340
But Allan, his name's Allan,
he's only been there for, what,

241
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:48,060
like, four years, but he's got a degree,

242
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:53,002
so, boom, suddenly he's
regional manager and I'm not.

243
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:56,682
And that's okay. I mean, it's okay.

244
00:15:57,040 --> 00:16:00,700
But I know Laura, I know she's worried.

245
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:05,567
She wonders if I'm ever,
ever going to make any money.

246
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:09,842
Your wife seems to respect you, sir.

247
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:12,161
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

248
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:14,443
It is what it is, you know.

249
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:18,763
What about you, though?
What about you? What are your plans?

250
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:22,020
Figured I'd get on a bus tomorrow,
head down to Florida or something

251
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:23,100
and start looking for work.

252
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:24,380
I've done construction work before.

253
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:26,260
So, I'm sure I'll find something.

254
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:29,564
No, no, no, no, no. That's crazy.

255
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:31,180
That's crazy. You don't
know where you're going.

256
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:32,820
Stay here for a couple more days.

257
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:34,900
No. No, I can't. (SIGHS)

00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,820
I couldn't impose on your

You're not... Impose on our...

And "sir"? You're calling me "sir" now?

00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:43,180
You gotta stop with the "sir,"
my name's Spencer.

262
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:45,220
You gotta call me Spencer,
for God sakes.

- All right.
- Okay.

265
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:49,580
So you're sticking around, right?

266
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:51,460
You stick around at least till
you know where you're going.

649
00:43:03,840 --> 00:43:07,283
Not confirmed, but she gave
her name as Anna Peterson.

650
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:09,740
Peterson.

651
00:43:09,840 --> 00:43:11,220
As in Caleb Peterson?

652
00:43:11,320 --> 00:43:12,780
His sister.

653
00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:14,340

If we need to charter something, do it.

656

And I'm gonna need some shooters.

657

what do I tell them?

Look, before we get started,

668
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:10,900
I just want to make sure that
you've got some cash on you.

No offense.

675
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:33,660
I mean, it's a standard Beretta.
I'm sure you're familiar with it.

676
00:44:33,760 --> 00:44:37,123
In my opinion, if you've seen one
of these, you've seen them all.

677
00:44:38,440 --> 00:44:41,380
But this baby, this here is

678
00:44:41,480 --> 00:44:43,620
a 9-millimeter Witness Elite.

679
00:44:43,720 --> 00:44:47,740
It's a very similar weapon to
the Beretta, but I prefer the recoil.

680
00:44:47,840 --> 00:44:49,804
I mean, it's got
absolutely no kick at all.

681
00:45:03,600 --> 00:45:04,801
You army?

682
00:45:05,200 --> 00:45:06,401
Yes, sir.

Oh, I'll take 'em all.

maybe it's his uncle or something.

That's what I'm trying to figure out.

I need to talk to the police.

The cops found those
drugs in Zeke's room,

975
01:01:32,120 --> 01:01:33,940
so they think they've got their guy.

976
01:01:34,040 --> 01:01:35,540
So, what do you need me to do?

977
01:01:35,640 --> 01:01:38,730
Get any information you can on this guy.

978
01:01:39,520 --> 01:01:43,008
Do you really think David
killed Craig and that other guy?

979
01:01:43,520 --> 01:01:45,165
Yeah. I do.

980
01:01:47,120 --> 01:01:49,163
Okay. I'll see if I can find anything.

was used, yes. But that's no excuse...

1030

So, that makes it a hate crime.

(STAMMERING) Oh, certainly.

1067

And she's trying to make
a case to the police

Do you think I killed Craig?

I don't care.

1073
01:06:59,640 --> 01:07:01,340
But that's why

1074
01:07:01,440 --> 01:07:03,500
she wanted me to check out
that plastic surgeon in Florida.

1075
01:07:03,600 --> 01:07:05,340
She wanted to know what
the connection was there.

1076
01:07:05,440 --> 01:07:09,300
Yeah, I mean, why would I
need a plastic surgeon, right?

1077
01:07:09,400 --> 01:07:10,886
To change your appearance.

1078
01:07:11,120 --> 01:07:13,209
Like, the bones in your face.

1079
01:07:13,400 --> 01:07:16,365
And maybe scar up your fingers
so you don't have prints.

1080
01:07:16,840 --> 01:07:19,247
(SCOFFS)
I mean, at least that's what I figured.

1081
01:07:19,920 --> 01:07:21,580
I know you're not really David Collins,

1082
01:07:21,680 --> 01:07:24,020
I looked him up right
after Anna said that.

1083
01:07:24,120 --> 01:07:27,460
So, maybe you don't want
people to know who you are.

1084
01:07:27,560 --> 01:07:29,900
A doctor who would do that sort
of thing is probably pretty rare.

1085
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:31,620
I mean, there's probably
rules against it.

1086
01:07:31,720 --> 01:07:34,820
But that doctor, well,
I guess he needs the money,

1087
01:07:34,920 --> 01:07:36,690
so he'd do that kind of work.

1088
01:07:40,480 --> 01:07:42,523
That's an interesting theory.

1089
01:07:44,160 --> 01:07:45,820
I'm not going to tell anyone about it.

1090
01:07:45,920 --> 01:07:47,380
And nobody will believe Anna.

1091
01:07:47,480 --> 01:07:49,409
She doesn't have anything against you.

1092
01:07:51,680 --> 01:07:53,848
You killed Dad's boss, too, right?

1093
01:07:55,320 --> 01:07:57,363
I don't care. I'm not
going say anything.
