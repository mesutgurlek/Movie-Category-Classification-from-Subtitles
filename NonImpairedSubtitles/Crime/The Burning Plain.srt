What? 

3
00:01:24,143 --> 00:01:25,536
You fell asleep again.

4
00:01:27,417 --> 00:01:29,733
Give me just five more minutes, please.

5
00:01:31,002 --> 00:01:32,922
No. Get out.

6
00:02:46,024 --> 00:02:46,983
Hey. 

7

11
00:02:56,766 --> 00:02:57,655
Maybe. 

12
00:02:57,895 --> 00:02:58,978
Did he know me?

13
00:03:28,041 --> 00:03:29,059
Good morning everyone. 

14
00:03:29,355 --> 00:03:30,359
Good morning. 

15
00:03:30,394 --> 00:03:32,234
Talk to me, Lawrence,
what we have for specials? 

16
00:03:32,269 --> 00:03:33,717
Lobster in white wine sauce. 

17
00:03:34,024 --> 00:03:36,002
- What else?

18
00:03:36,546 --> 00:03:38,400
Linguini in a tomato sauce.

00:03:38,526 --> 00:03:39,440
It looks good. 

20
00:03:40,207 --> 00:03:42,195
More than 25kinds 
food for the wedding? 

21
00:03:57,855 --> 00:03:59,443
Welcome back, Mr and Mrs Stevens. 

22
00:03:59,602 --> 00:04:01,303
- So nice to see you again. 
- I am happy to see you. 

23
00:04:01,338 --> 00:04:02,201
You remember the Sophie? 

24
00:04:02,569 --> 00:04:04,884
I pray to you to lead 
Your usual table. Bon appetit. 

25
00:04:05,637 --> 00:04:06,632
Follow me. 

26
00:04:07,559 --> 00:04:09,844
Sylvia, six table needs 
helpful in choosing wine. 

27
00:04:10,121 --> 00:04:11,123
Thank you. 

28
00:04:14,903 --> 00:04:16,134
- Hello. 
- Hi. 

29
00:04:16,309 --> 00:04:18,172
Vivi told me that you need 
a recommendation on wine. 

30
00:04:18,277 --> 00:04:20,055
Yes. I ordered the "Petite File". 

31
00:04:21,269 --> 00:04:24,615
I'd recommend "Castle Chateau" in'87. 

32
00:04:24,787 --> 00:04:25,903
A great Bordeaux wine. 

33
00:04:26,722 --> 00:04:27,642
Never heard of him. 

34
00:04:28,811 --> 00:04:29,697
Not on the list of menus. 

35
00:04:29,732 --> 00:04:31,722
We reserve a special down in the cellar. 

36
00:04:31,757 --> 00:04:33,225
I think you appreciate it. 

37
00:04:33,729 --> 00:04:34,986
Thanks, would be fantastic. 

38
00:04:35,403 --> 00:04:36,614
Be right back. 

39
00:04:41,290 --> 00:04:43,773
- Table 18note demanded payment. 
- Okay. 

40
00:04:44,817 --> 00:04:48,109
- A to ask Vivi to go ... 
- Out a little, okay? 

41
00:04:48,144 --> 00:04:48,997
Okay. 

42
00:06:27,232 --> 00:06:29,298
A wonderful idea, "Chateau Castle. 

43
00:06:29,739 --> 00:06:30,794
It is one of my favorite wines. 

44
00:06:30,870 --> 00:06:32,430
What other Friday you recommend? 

45
00:06:32,857 --> 00:06:33,999
Depends on the food. 

46
00:06:34,286 --> 00:06:36,333
It's okay, you can think of that 
When you invite to dinner. 

47
00:06:40,023 --> 00:06:41,357
Here, I meet with clients. 

48
00:07:45,858 --> 00:07:48,076
This burned my father 
and that fucking slut. 

49
00:07:48,706 --> 00:07:49,716
How a fire broke out? 

50
00:07:50,197 --> 00:07:52,384
Police said 
that they left open and the gas exploded. 

51
00:07:53,158 --> 00:07:54,223
So it was an accident? 

52
00:07:54,885 --> 00:07:56,810
Yes. That said Sheriff. 

53
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:01,625
It regularly when they died. 

54
00:08:04,147 --> 00:08:05,995
Their bodies remained united 
because of fire? 

55
00:08:12,072 --> 00:08:13,515
I had to cut them asunder. 

56
00:08:18,486 --> 00:08:19,573
Who was that bitch? 

57
00:08:22,374 --> 00:08:23,738
A matron of Autuma. 

58
00:08:26,496 --> 00:08:27,310
There they met. 

59
00:08:29,327 --> 00:08:30,826
Halfway between the cities. 

60
00:08:34,199 --> 00:08:35,108
What are you doing? 

61
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:46,575
Who knows what he 
Ardea dad when ... 

62
00:09:03,529 --> 00:09:04,593
Why did you bring on Xavier? 

63
00:09:06,065 --> 00:09:06,918
Because it's my friend. 

64
00:09:07,546 --> 00:09:09,207
Bury your father and do circus tomorrow. 

65
00:09:12,753 --> 00:09:14,042
There are no circus, motherfucker. 

66
00:09:15,773 --> 00:09:16,573
Fuck you. 

67
00:10:12,292 --> 00:10:14,426
Hello, mother, aunt, Rebecca ... 

68
00:10:18,495 --> 00:10:19,593
You fight with Cristobal? 

69
00:10:20,111 --> 00:10:20,979
No. 

70
00:10:22,359 --> 00:10:23,605
I do not want to hear to argue. 

71
00:10:24,558 --> 00:10:25,485
Now more than ever. 

72
00:10:28,531 --> 00:10:29,398
Well. 

73
00:10:32,718 --> 00:10:33,645
That the whiskey is my father. 

74
00:10:34,594 --> 00:10:35,440
It? 

75
00:10:37,580 --> 00:10:39,019
When the hell you drink it? 

76
00:11:07,138 --> 00:11:08,024
Santiago? 

77
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,024
- Excuse me. 
- Cristobal. 

78
00:11:13,908 --> 00:11:15,450
Your mother does not go to the funeral. 

79
00:11:15,690 --> 00:11:17,617
Neither Rebecca nor me. 

80
00:11:18,357 --> 00:11:20,887
- Bitch do not deserve. 
- You did not do anything. 

81
00:11:22,029 --> 00:11:24,054
I'll take it. Both. 

82
00:11:32,369 --> 00:11:33,866
For yours is the kingdom of Heaven ... 

83
00:11:34,670 --> 00:11:35,677
forever ... 

84
00:11:36,015 --> 00:11:36,820
Amen. 

85
00:11:37,711 --> 00:11:41,474
In the name of the Father, 
the Son and the Holy Spirit. Amen. 

86
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:42,668
Amen. 

87
00:11:43,441 --> 00:11:44,633
Who are they? 

88
00:11:47,507 --> 00:11:48,400
I do not know. 

89
00:11:49,731 --> 00:11:52,383
And now we say goodbye 
of our brother, Nick Martinez. 

90
00:12:07,092 --> 00:12:08,868
I hope your father decay in hell. 

91
00:12:09,796 --> 00:12:12,651
That bitch took my 
all I had better. 

92
00:12:12,946 --> 00:12:14,537
Hey. Leave the guys alone. 

93
00:12:14,572 --> 00:12:15,441
Alone? 

94
00:12:15,837 --> 00:12:18,038
Their father is fault 
that have no parent my children. 

95
00:12:19,396 --> 00:12:20,653
I hope you rot in hell. 

96
00:13:11,879 --> 00:13:12,947
<i> Maria, come on! </ i> 

97
00:13:16,574 --> 00:13:17,529

00:13:31,315 --> 00:13:33,457
Hey, baby, we have a job. 

101
00:13:35,215 --> 00:13:36,597
Can I stay with my friends? 

102
00:13:36,856 --> 00:13:38,111

Listen ...

My cousin left me to use his trailer. 

136
00:18:39,563 --> 00:18:40,647
I was never there. 

137
00:18:41,724 --> 00:18:43,495
But it is far from everything. 

138
00:18:44,547 --> 00:18:45,380
Want to go? 

139
00:19:37,509 --> 00:19:38,774
Not "Hilton". 

140
00:20:14,534 --> 00:20:15,868
I want cereal, Mariana.

Mariana, what we have for dinner? 

144
00:20:27,309 --> 00:20:29,090
I prepared myself 
friends and cereals. 

145
00:20:36,620 --> 00:20:37,515
Hey, kids. 

146
00:20:38,756 --> 00:20:40,438
Supermarket was crowded.

Oh come the day after tomorrow.

00:20:56,434 --> 00:20:57,575
I do this. 

153
00:21:04,043 --> 00:21:04,858
Hey. 

154
00:21:05,605 --> 00:21:06,490
Hey. Take the guess. 

155
00:21:06,613 --> 00:21:07,953
That was the office of Senator Park. 

156
00:21:07,988 --> 00:21:10,185
Want to eat tonight 
another eight people. 

157
00:21:10,419 --> 00:21:11,979
Shit. 
Could not call the day before? 

158
00:21:13,854 --> 00:21:14,826
Lawrence? 

159
00:21:15,774 --> 00:21:17,396
Comes a senator in two hours. 

160
00:21:17,587 --> 00:21:20,111
- He wants as usual. 
- Two hours and expect everything to be ready? 

161
00:21:21,285 --> 00:21:23,492
A call to the market over 
to bring something. 

162
00:21:30,819 --> 00:21:31,854
Where were you last night? 

163
00:21:33,756 --> 00:21:34,666
What? 

164
00:21:35,733 --> 00:21:36,965
Where were you last night? 

165
00:21:37,753 --> 00:21:38,579
Home. 

166
00:21:40,084 --> 00:21:40,970
Who? 

167
00:21:47,963 --> 00:21:50,239
- You promised not to put any questions. 
- Who the hell? 

168
00:21:51,883 --> 00:21:52,925
I work. 

169
00:21:55,238 --> 00:21:57,728
Be right back with another bottle. 
Bon appetit. 

170
00:21:59,114 --> 00:22:01,617
- Why is Senator empty glass? 
- Sorry, Sylvia. 

171
00:22:14,963 --> 00:22:16,486
Senator seemed satisfied. 

172
00:22:17,481 --> 00:22:19,627
So tell me. He left a good tip. 

173
00:22:20,437 --> 00:22:22,755
I like that 
to vote at the next election. 

174
00:22:32,064 --> 00:22:33,919
- You are incredible. 
- No, no. 

175
00:22:35,839 --> 00:22:37,552
That I want for Christmas next year. 

176
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:39,048
To remember that. 

177
00:22:40,128 --> 00:22:41,003
Enjoy. 

178
00:22:44,946 --> 00:22:45,858
Sylvia! 

179
00:22:45,893 --> 00:22:46,976
Who the hell is this guy? 

180
00:22:47,313 --> 00:22:50,099
Jesus, John. 
Do not do this now. It's just a friend, okay? 

181
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:52,726
Is a client. 
I saw him taking lunch here yesterday. 

182
00:22:52,778 --> 00:22:54,507
Yes. Yesterday. 

183
00:22:54,542 --> 00:22:55,402
Wait. Just ... 

184
00:22:56,337 --> 00:22:59,233
Get laid with all ... and this is? 

185
00:22:59,997 --> 00:23:03,077
When you leave your wife, 
you can talk. 

186
00:23:04,221 --> 00:23:05,224
Let's go. 

187
00:23:44,064 --> 00:23:45,380
- Jesus. 
- I want to talk to you. 

188
00:23:47,386 --> 00:23:48,355
- Unlock the door. 
- Hey. 

189
00:23:48,390 --> 00:23:50,049
- Get out and talk. 
- Hey, come on, leave it alone. 

190
00:23:50,084 --> 00:23:50,923
Fuck you. 

191
00:23:51,297 --> 00:23:52,176
- Sylvia! 
- What? 

192
00:23:52,211 --> 00:23:53,690
- What is your problem? 
- I want to talk to you. 

193
00:23:53,725 --> 00:23:55,628
- My friend, let her go. 
- I told you to go hell. 

194
00:23:56,014 --> 00:23:57,247
John. John! 

195
00:23:57,867 --> 00:23:59,428
Jesus! Are you seven years? 

196
00:24:00,203 --> 00:24:01,579
- What are you doing? 
- I want to talk. 

197
00:24:01,855 --> 00:24:02,990
This is stupid. 

198
00:24:03,326 --> 00:24:05,145
I let you solve your problems 
your friend. 

199
00:24:05,792 --> 00:24:07,817
- It is not my friend. 
- Why do this? 

200
00:24:08,399 --> 00:24:09,589
Do not touch me. 

201
00:24:10,383 --> 00:24:11,284
Give me five minutes. 

202
00:24:11,550 --> 00:24:13,343
What do you think? Did you follow to hell! 

203
00:24:13,540 --> 00:24:15,569
- Hey, Sylvia. 
- You are my master, John. 

204
00:24:15,810 --> 00:24:17,254
Do me a favor and disappear. 

205
00:24:17,602 --> 00:24:19,088
You ... 
Let me go home. 

206
00:24:22,484 --> 00:24:23,343
Are you okay? 

207
00:24:23,443 --> 00:24:24,320
What do you want? 

208
00:24:24,340 --> 00:24:25,911
<i> Are you okay? Are you okay? </ I> 

209
00:24:26,112 --> 00:24:27,227
I understand. 

210
00:24:27,290 --> 00:24:29,177
<i> Hey, hey! I drive home. </ I> 

211
00:24:29,327 --> 00:24:30,128
What? 

212
00:24:30,163 --> 00:24:31,089
<i> I drive home? </ i> 

213
00:24:33,422 --> 00:24:34,923
<i> Come on. Hey, I drive home? </ I> 

214
00:24:39,066 --> 00:24:39,926
Home. 

215
00:24:45,743 --> 00:24:46,647
What is your name? 

216
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:48,325
Me? Carlos. 

217
00:24:49,185 --> 00:24:50,175
You? 

218
00:24:51,292 --> 00:24:52,263
Sylvia. 

219
00:24:54,972 --> 00:24:55,964
Sylvia? 

220
00:24:58,245 --> 00:24:59,274
Yes, Sylvia. 

221
00:27:53,624 --> 00:27:54,631
Hello. 

222
00:27:56,130 --> 00:27:56,943
You know who I am? 

223
00:27:59,459 --> 00:28:00,607
I came here to argue. 

224
00:28:01,779 --> 00:28:02,770
What? 

225
00:28:05,011 --> 00:28:06,442
I just want to know more, much more. 

226
00:28:08,186 --> 00:28:11,191
Who was your mother ... 
what was with my father ... 

227
00:28:12,372 --> 00:28:14,272
Already know what was. 

228
00:28:15,679 --> 00:28:16,723
No, I do not know. 

229
00:28:20,387 --> 00:28:21,334
Can we talk another time? 

230
00:28:24,412 --> 00:28:26,686
Well. I look for you. 

231
00:29:01,827 --> 00:29:02,943
Dad! 

232
00:29:08,838 --> 00:29:09,895
Dad! 

233
00:29:16,185 --> 00:29:17,282
Dad! 

234
00:29:38,163 --> 00:29:39,029
Hey. 

235
00:29:39,886 --> 00:29:40,765
Hey, baby. 

236
00:29:41,558 --> 00:29:43,334
I do not come back until tomorrow. 

237
00:29:43,407 --> 00:29:45,089
Yes, but I finished early. 

238
00:29:47,833 --> 00:29:48,747
Where are the kids? 

239
00:29:49,433 --> 00:29:50,626
They went to a baseball game. 

240
00:29:51,267 --> 00:29:52,528
You want to wait 
to eat lunch with them? 

241
00:29:52,965 --> 00:29:53,805
Yes. 

242
00:29:56,604 --> 00:29:57,779
Go get washed. 

243
00:30:03,751 --> 00:30:05,115
- Excuse me, dear. 
- Thanks, baby. 

244
00:30:05,875 --> 00:30:07,174
I will fix shortly. 

245
00:30:08,725 --> 00:30:10,043
I gotta go tonight. 

246
00:30:10,845 --> 00:30:11,714
Where? 

247
00:30:12,292 --> 00:30:14,096
At K-Mart in Saint Helena. 

248
00:30:14,685 --> 00:30:15,689
Come with you. 

249
00:30:16,836 --> 00:30:20,306
You should get some fabrics 
and I go to the butcher. 

250
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:24,534
It's okay. You ride. 
I have to buy a radio. 

251
00:30:29,115 --> 00:30:30,138
Hey. 

252
00:30:30,372 --> 00:30:31,410
Hey, kids. 

253
00:30:31,445 --> 00:30:32,501
Now it works. 

254
00:30:32,842 --> 00:30:34,059
Daddy, Daddy. 

255
00:30:34,094 --> 00:30:35,868
I'm very glad you are here. 

256
00:30:37,755 --> 00:30:39,349
- Hi, Dad. 
- Hey, girl ... 

257
00:30:43,728 --> 00:30:44,821
Get in, baby. 

258
00:30:45,032 --> 00:30:45,919
So. 

259
00:30:47,082 --> 00:30:48,294
I forgot my wallet. 

260
00:30:49,797 --> 00:30:50,995
I want the window. 

261
00:30:51,557 --> 00:30:53,497
Bobby! Monnie! Bobby! 

262
00:30:53,740 --> 00:30:54,653
Bobby! 

263
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,029
It was the first. Sit down and get back. 

264
00:31:00,242 --> 00:31:01,652
Put your seat belt. 

265
00:31:01,687 --> 00:31:02,711
Children, listen to it on your sister. 

266
00:31:04,502 --> 00:31:05,485
I go to pee. 

267
00:31:08,532 --> 00:31:09,861
And I miss you. 

268
00:31:11,474 --> 00:31:13,725
Try. Try to escape. 

269
00:31:15,023 --> 00:31:16,018
I love you. 

270
00:31:16,053 --> 00:31:16,969
Who are you talking about? 

271
00:31:20,285 --> 00:31:21,505
Laetitia. 

272
00:31:21,583 --> 00:31:22,813
Come on, we wait. 

273
00:31:23,806 --> 00:31:25,228
- Where you going? 
- In the bathroom. 

274
00:31:29,359 --> 00:31:30,451
Daddy, I want on that. 

275
00:31:30,950 --> 00:31:32,943
No, trying to save money 
remember? 

276
00:31:33,365 --> 00:31:35,234
I want to find 
things on the list. 

277
00:31:35,455 --> 00:31:37,168
Save money for a new home. 

278
00:31:37,818 --> 00:31:39,992
Can I get keys? Go get tissues. 

279
00:31:41,363 --> 00:31:42,454
I come with you. 

280
00:31:43,432 --> 00:31:45,691
Go to your sister and look for a jumper. 
T miss much. 

281
00:31:46,698 --> 00:31:48,627
- Come on, baby. 
- Dad, I go up here. 

282
00:32:39,595 --> 00:32:40,446
Hello. 

283
00:32:41,373 --> 00:32:42,293
Hello. 

284
00:32:57,611 --> 00:32:58,631
Forget it. 

285
00:33:04,664 --> 00:33:06,000
Sorry. 

286
00:33:08,179 --> 00:33:10,278
Order was not ready and I had to wait. 

287
00:33:11,606 --> 00:33:12,879
I gotta get back to. 

288
00:33:13,004 --> 00:33:15,601
You can get the money 
for presentation at school. 

289
00:33:16,647 --> 00:33:17,891
Got everything on the list? 

290
00:33:19,132 --> 00:33:20,111
- Open the back, dear? 
- Mariana? 

291
00:33:21,558 --> 00:33:22,479
Sure. 

292
00:33:26,840 --> 00:33:28,302
- Give me the keys. 
- Okay. 

293
00:33:29,148 --> 00:33:29,999
Are you okay? 

294
00:33:58,136 --> 00:33:59,189
Want to come inside? 

295
00:34:01,948 --> 00:34:02,820
I come in? 

296
00:34:04,569 --> 00:34:05,414
Yes, go. 

297
00:34:10,200 --> 00:34:11,062
Well. 

298
00:34:33,105 --> 00:34:34,265
Want a drink? 

299
00:34:36,095 --> 00:34:36,971
Drink? 

300
00:34:37,223 --> 00:34:38,392
No ... I do not want to drink. 

301
00:34:47,238 --> 00:34:48,766
Go get changed. It is cold. 

302
00:35:14,994 --> 00:35:16,303
Are you sure that you want? 

303
00:35:23,999 --> 00:35:24,902
No. 

304
00:35:31,882 --> 00:35:32,890
Why? 

305
00:35:36,081 --> 00:35:37,173
I do not like? 

306
00:36:19,509 --> 00:36:20,591
What are you doing? 

307
00:36:20,912 --> 00:36:22,853
If you see my dad going to kill you. 

308
00:36:24,213 --> 00:36:25,435
I said I have to look. 

309
00:36:26,695 --> 00:36:27,736
Yes, but not here. 

310
00:36:28,642 --> 00:36:31,470
Wait on the road to Guadalupe. 

311
00:36:32,047 --> 00:36:32,928
Well. 

312
00:37:08,787 --> 00:37:10,132
Why did you want to see me? 

313
00:37:11,733 --> 00:37:12,538
I do not know. 

314
00:37:14,273 --> 00:37:16,001
I do not think it is okay 
to talk to me. 

315
00:37:16,981 --> 00:37:17,850
Why? 

316
00:37:29,443 --> 00:37:30,621
You look like your mom? 

317
00:37:31,397 --> 00:37:32,321
No. 

318
00:37:33,017 --> 00:37:35,460
- You look to your father? 
- A little. 

319
00:37:36,940 --> 00:37:38,373
You know how he knew 
mother with my father? 

320
00:37:40,089 --> 00:37:41,186
No, I have no idea. 

321
00:37:43,125 --> 00:37:44,109
Hand it over. 

322
00:37:54,347 --> 00:37:55,294
We got it! 

323
00:38:06,184 --> 00:38:07,095
You like to hunt? 

324
00:38:08,172 --> 00:38:09,010
Very much. 

325
00:38:09,554 --> 00:38:12,399
Ex-boyfriend used to take me hunting, 
but I have not been since we broke up. 

326
00:38:14,690 --> 00:38:15,880
My father taught me how to chase. 

327
00:38:17,586 --> 00:38:18,739
You loved your father? 

328
00:38:19,673 --> 00:38:20,474
Yes. 

329
00:38:22,372 --> 00:38:23,690
And I loved my mother, but ... 

330
00:38:24,629 --> 00:38:25,793
not a pleasure. 

331
00:38:29,576 --> 00:38:30,812

357
00:42:48,995 --> 00:42:49,877
Hello. 

358
00:42:53,133 --> 00:42:54,350
Look at this place ... 

359
00:43:00,397 --> 00:43:01,810
Me very happy. 

360
00:43:05,056 --> 00:43:08,383
I'd be happier if we had 
hot water so I can take a shower. 

361
00:43:10,485 --> 00:43:12,073
You taste better that way. 

362
00:43:15,480 --> 00:43:17,090
No. No, please. 

363
00:43:17,531 --> 00:43:18,893
Not there. 

364
00:43:30,472 --> 00:43:31,720
Why? 

365
00:43:36,563 --> 00:43:38,423
Because I like 
that side of my body. 

366
00:43:40,304 --> 00:43:41,985
How do you know that I do not like me? 

367
00:44:20,787 --> 00:44:22,680
I had cancer two years ago. 

368
00:45:11,330 --> 00:45:12,301
Hey. 

369
00:45:12,912 --> 00:45:14,031
Where were you? 

370
00:45:14,390 --> 00:45:15,558
I went to Libbis. 

371
00:45:16,353 --> 00:45:17,972
Bobby has been cut to 
with a piece of glass. 

372
00:45:18,134 --> 00:45:19,665
A must scythe doctor. 

373
00:45:19,700 --> 00:45:21,348
- You okay? 
- It's good. 

374
00:45:43,574 --> 00:45:45,611
He cried continuously and I cried. 

375
00:46:01,922 --> 00:46:03,338
To be good. 

376
00:46:03,373 --> 00:46:04,425
- Bye. 
- Bye. 

377
00:46:11,568 --> 00:46:13,750
I forgot my homework. 
Go, you get behind. 

378
00:46:14,195 --> 00:46:15,475
- I expected to. 
- Do not go. 

379
00:47:15,866 --> 00:47:17,067
- Hi. 
- Hi. 

380
00:47:17,774 --> 00:47:19,728
Finally you have hot water. 

381
00:47:27,100 --> 00:47:28,729
- Can I help? 
- It's okay. 

382
00:47:29,734 --> 00:47:30,923
Almost done. 

383
00:47:55,940 --> 00:47:57,665
- Works? 
- That's 

384
00:48:20,460 --> 00:48:21,580
What are you doing? 

385
00:48:24,324 --> 00:48:25,474
What? 

386
00:48:26,736 --> 00:48:27,811
<i> need to talk, Mariana. </ i> 

387
00:48:31,470 --> 00:48:33,176
Wrong girl, my name is Sylvia. 

388
00:48:33,538 --> 00:48:34,426
Okay? 

389
00:48:34,638 --> 00:48:35,774
Santiago <i> sent me to you. </ i> 

390
00:48:42,903 --> 00:48:44,032
What did you say?

391
00:48:45,155 --> 00:48:47,776
Santiago <i> sent me to you. </ i> 

392
00:48:53,007 --> 00:48:55,117
<i> Mariana, is your daughter. </ i>

00:48:56,503 --> 00:48:57,522
<i> called Maria. </ i> 

394
00:49:04,480 --> 00:49:05,684
Stay away from me. 

395
00:49:31,973 --> 00:49:34,071
Here is Mom and Dad with us 
when I was small. 

396
00:49:36,396 --> 00:49:37,932
We did bathroom ... 

397
00:49:41,468 --> 00:49:43,062
This is the last photo of the mother. 

398
00:49:43,887 --> 00:49:44,973
For her birthday. 

399
00:49:50,003 --> 00:49:51,154
And this is me. 

400
00:49:56,164 --> 00:49:57,288
I have one to me? 

401
00:50:00,799 --> 00:50:02,299
Only if I make a scar. 

402
00:50:05,529 --> 00:50:06,454
What? 

403
00:50:07,222 --> 00:50:08,553
I remember this day. 

404
00:50:11,540 --> 00:50:12,558
Would you do me one? 

405
00:50:14,288 --> 00:50:15,409
Let's meet at night. 

406
00:50:16,111 --> 00:50:17,224
To do then. 

407
00:50:18,032 --> 00:50:19,746
In a desert fire bushes. 

408
00:50:39,433 --> 00:50:42,862
My grandfather told me 
that purifies the smoke bushes at night. 

409
00:50:44,182 --> 00:50:46,450
- Ard as artificial. 
- Yes. 

410
00:50:46,804 --> 00:50:47,604
I like it. 

411
00:50:53,904 --> 00:50:55,144
Turn up your sleeve. 

412
00:50:57,728 --> 00:50:58,694
Why? 

413
00:50:59,290 --> 00:51:00,927
Like to have a scar from me. 

414
00:51:10,406 --> 00:51:11,431
Shit. 

415
00:51:12,531 --> 00:51:13,548

Good night.

Let me sleep with you. 

420
00:52:05,922 --> 00:52:06,955
Are you crazy? 

421
00:52:10,188 --> 00:52:12,050
I swear I did not touch you. 

422
00:52:14,366 --> 00:52:15,929
You have to wake up my sister, Monnie. 

423
00:52:20,290 --> 00:52:21,982
You said that your dad is not home? 

424
00:52:23,020 --> 00:52:24,044
I could sleep in his room. 

425
00:52:49,430 --> 00:52:50,921
What you wear your mother go to bed? 

426
00:52:54,977 --> 00:52:55,893
A bedgown. 

427
00:52:57,043 --> 00:52:58,107
You can dress up with her? 

428
00:53:04,881 --> 00:53:06,130

00:55:03,877 --> 00:55:05,115
Want to go? 

436
00:55:08,698 --> 00:55:09,633
No. 

437
00:55:33,478 --> 00:55:34,361

438
00:55:34,668 --> 00:55:37,110
He called the d-Turner, 
a table for eight people. 

439
00:55:37,988 --> 00:55:40,259
- We all tables occupied. 
- I know. What do you do, Sophie? 

440
00:55:42,200 --> 00:55:43,013
Are you okay? 

441
00:55:43,512 --> 00:55:45,250
Watch it all until I get back. 

442
00:55:51,290 --> 00:55:52,438
You can come out later? 

443
00:55:53,673 --> 00:55:54,672
We need to talk. 

444
00:56:04,512 --> 00:56:05,430

I think so. 

449
00:56:26,122 --> 00:56:27,631
To run together. 

450
00:56:28,816 --> 00:56:30,292
Only two of us. Today. 

451
00:56:31,382 --> 00:56:32,509
What are you talking about? 

452
00:56:32,891 --> 00:56:36,918
Do your bags and go somewhere 
in New York to take over again. 

453
00:56:37,084 --> 00:56:39,221
Anywhere but to go. 

454
00:56:43,999 --> 00:56:45,490
- I understand ... 
- Yes or no? 

455
00:56:49,971 --> 00:56:51,392
I do not know. Do I need to consider. 

456
00:57:30,638 --> 00:57:31,492
Mariana! 

457
00:57:33,952 --> 00:57:34,788
Mariana! 

458
00:58:04,724 --> 00:58:06,711
Hello. 

459
00:58:07,078 --> 00:58:07,957
Hi, Mom. 

460
00:58:08,886 --> 00:58:09,689
Did you eat dinner? 

461
00:58:10,433 --> 00:58:11,685
No, I expected you. 

462
00:58:13,250 --> 00:58:14,315
I go to prepare. 

463
00:58:22,218 --> 00:58:23,279
Why did you come so late? 

464
00:58:24,034 --> 00:58:26,264
Baby, you scared me. 

465
00:58:27,205 --> 00:58:28,224
What did you do today? 

466
00:58:29,911 --> 00:58:31,605
I went to get some tissues, 

467
00:58:31,978 --> 00:58:33,562
then we went to Libbies. 

468
00:58:34,217 --> 00:58:35,999
I was myself at Libbies. 
I have not seen there. 

469
00:58:36,952 --> 00:58:38,698
Maybe you were not there when I was too. 

470
00:58:38,981 --> 00:58:40,281
I was there at four o'clock. 

471
00:58:43,672 --> 00:58:45,988
Ending questions and help me. 

472
00:58:46,445 --> 00:58:47,616
Clean this mess. 

473
00:59:02,814 --> 00:59:05,087
Nick? Hey, I'm Gina. 

474
00:59:05,573 --> 00:59:06,670
We need to talk. 

475
00:59:08,721 --> 00:59:10,361
No, not the trailer. 

476
00:59:11,497 --> 00:59:12,650
At the supermarket? 

477
00:59:13,602 --> 00:59:14,537
11Hour? 

478
00:59:15,128 --> 00:59:16,041
Well. 

479
00:59:16,217 --> 00:59:17,062
Bye. 

480
00:59:19,335 --> 00:59:20,668
I love you, you love me. 

481
00:59:20,842 --> 00:59:22,365
I do not know if it is correct, but that's it. 

482
00:59:22,856 --> 00:59:23,749
Want to give up on this? 

483
00:59:23,784 --> 00:59:25,428
No, please understand. 

484
00:59:25,463 --> 00:59:27,089
Answer me, you want to give up on this? 

485
00:59:27,762 --> 00:59:29,319
I do not want to see you. 

486
00:59:30,426 --> 00:59:31,321
Forever? 

487
00:59:31,513 --> 00:59:32,965
I can meet you. 

488
00:59:36,383 --> 00:59:38,916
I expect you caravan. 
Every day at noon. 

489
00:59:39,494 --> 00:59:40,494
You should back up. 

490
00:59:56,522 --> 00:59:57,840
- Hi, Mom. 
- Hey. 

491
00:59:59,018 --> 01:00:01,481
- I got a surprise. 
- What is this? 

492
01:00:02,632 --> 01:00:05,708
Well, we had a picnic 
long and I thought ... 

493
01:00:06,493 --> 01:00:08,294
It is pretty cold in here, baby. 

494
01:00:08,871 --> 01:00:10,368
Is there a secret holiday? 

495
01:00:10,943 --> 01:00:12,474
- Can you get a cookie. 
- Okay. 

496
01:00:12,791 --> 01:00:15,003
- Can I get a cookie? 
- Do you not eat your lunch. 

497
01:00:19,669 --> 01:00:20,569
I do burgerii. 

498
01:00:25,493 --> 01:00:27,061
- Are you ready? 
- Not yet. 

499
01:00:29,757 --> 01:00:31,237
Hey, kids. Come to stay with us. 

500
01:00:32,335 --> 01:00:34,003
- Hey, kids. 
- Why have a party? 

501
01:00:34,483 --> 01:00:36,530
It is not a party, a picnic. 

502
01:00:36,962 --> 01:00:37,914
Fun. 

503
01:00:38,680 --> 01:00:39,480
I fear to do. 

504
01:00:39,710 --> 01:00:41,984
Come on, do not marshmallow 
~ a ~ kind of marshmallows? 

505
01:00:42,118 --> 01:00:43,448
I am not a child, parent. 

506
01:00:44,395 --> 01:00:46,478
Mariana? You want a bit? 

507
01:00:46,513 --> 01:00:48,494
I gotta go home to Kate, 
for a project at school. 

508
01:00:48,896 --> 01:00:50,485
- Bye, Daddy. 
- Bye, baby. 

509
01:02:14,261 --> 01:02:15,342
I can not. 

510
01:02:16,972 --> 01:02:17,973
Simply can not. 

511
01:02:20,430 --> 01:02:21,503
Sorry. 

512

513
01:02:45,884 --> 01:02:46,786
Friday! 

514
01:02:50,676 --> 01:02:51,504
Hey. 

515
01:02:55,622 --> 01:02:56,563
Are you okay? 

516
01:03:12,172 --> 01:03:13,336
Nor were there. 

517
01:03:14,536 --> 01:03:15,852
I should 
to check the "Palms". 

518
01:03:17,724 --> 01:03:19,127
I will find them. They left. 

519
01:03:19,886 --> 01:03:22,844
Believe me, a Mexican with a girl 
of 12years can hardly hide. 

520
01:03:23,510 --> 01:03:24,465
I find. 

521
01:03:25,277 --> 01:03:26,685
We must continue to look. 

522
01:03:37,878 --> 01:03:39,425
When you saw last? 

523
01:03:43,996 --> 01:03:45,849
I dropped it to two days 
after it was born. 

524
01:03:48,748 --> 01:03:49,589
Why? 

525
01:03:53,704 --> 01:03:54,887
Not deserve. 

526
01:04:13,008 --> 01:04:14,674
I think I really like. 

527
01:04:16,554 --> 01:04:17,846
- Hi, honey 
- Hey. 

528
01:04:18,268 --> 01:04:19,376
You seek someone. 

529
01:04:19,910 --> 01:04:20,738
Hello. 

530
01:04:22,362 --> 01:04:24,002
Hey, you never spoke 
about Mariana. 

531
01:04:26,152 --> 01:04:27,202
It is a friend from school. 

532
01:04:29,199 --> 01:04:30,844
- You want to stay to lunch? 
- No thanks. 

533
01:04:31,664 --> 01:04:33,496
No, I get lunch elsewhere. 

534
01:04:36,496 --> 01:04:38,888
- We get dinner at "Polus" 
- Yes. 

535
01:04:40,750 --> 01:04:42,398
- It's a pleasure to meet you. 
- Me too. 

536
01:04:42,844 --> 01:04:44,134
- See you later. 
- Okay. 

537
01:04:45,413 --> 01:04:46,429
Enjoy. 

538
01:04:46,464 --> 01:04:47,450
<i> Yes, son. </ i>

Here. 

542

It is well understood mother and father? 

543
01:05:14,946 --> 01:05:15,760
Middling. 

544
01:05:24,328 --> 01:05:25,153
Come here. 

545
01:05:31,577 --> 01:05:32,450
You still burn? 

546
01:05:33,406 --> 01:05:34,294
No. 

547
01:08:25,707 --> 01:08:27,623
With a girl? Are you sure? Thank you. 

548
01:08:29,733 --> 01:08:30,790
Room 51. 

549
01:08:31,637 --> 01:08:33,016
- What? 
- 51. 

550
01:08:42,964 --> 01:08:43,929

Maria! 

559
01:08:59,486 --> 01:09:00,378
Do not worry. 

560
01:09:00,413 --> 01:09:01,618
I think something new. 

561
01:10:12,173 --> 01:10:13,085
Hey. 

562
01:10:15,123 --> 01:10:15,948
Hey! 

563
01:10:17,121 --> 01:10:17,921
Maria! 

564

01:11:29,269 --> 01:11:31,741
Sorry I ran yesterday.

You just ...

Mary, speak English? 

576
01:11:55,424 --> 01:11:56,796
You grew. 

577
01:12:03,057 --> 01:12:04,734
I thought about you all the time. 

578
01:12:07,407 --> 01:12:08,944
In particular, when was your day of birth. 

579
01:12:12,448 --> 01:12:14,048
Try to imagine how I look. 

580
01:12:16,913 --> 01:12:18,237
You are very beautiful. 

581
01:12:22,666 --> 01:12:24,448
You look like your father. 

582
01:12:28,936 --> 01:12:30,308
Dad is in hospital. 

583
01:12:38,571 --> 01:12:39,510
Why? 

584
01:12:40,793 --> 01:12:42,008
He crashed plane. 

585
01:12:45,611 --> 01:12:46,770
It is okay? 

586
01:12:50,117 --> 01:12:51,105
I do not know. 

587
01:12:58,945 --> 01:13:00,198
It is a pilot ... 

588
01:13:02,271 --> 01:13:03,823
On a utility aircraft. 

589
01:13:05,508 --> 01:13:06,421

Well. To bed. 

595
01:15:48,958 --> 01:15:50,357
You said you have a prayer? 

596
01:15:51,318 --> 01:15:52,524
Do not ask me. 

597
01:15:53,036 --> 01:15:54,257
Is wrong, Mariana. 

598
01:15:55,836 --> 01:15:59,110
Many things are wrong, Mom, 
and can not be directed through prayer. 

599
01:16:01,099 --> 01:16:03,147
You behaved very strangely lately. 

600
01:16:05,106 --> 01:16:07,088
Tomorrow I want to tell me what you troubling. 

601
01:16:09,968 --> 01:16:10,854
Goodnight, baby. 

602
01:16:11,173 --> 01:16:12,106
Good night, Mom. 

603

Good night. 

604
01:16:37,275 --> 01:16:40,182
The girl who came here a day ... 
is her daughter? 

605
01:16:41,673 --> 01:16:42,575
Yes. 

606
01:16:44,139 --> 01:16:45,018
A rule? 

607
01:16:48,606 --> 01:16:49,608
Why do this? 

608
01:16:53,143 --> 01:16:54,142
It is your job. 

609
01:16:54,177 --> 01:16:55,627
Can not do that to your mother. 

610
01:16:55,662 --> 01:16:56,542
Stay out. 

611
01:16:59,073 --> 01:17:00,110
It is not enough what happened? 

612
01:17:01,061 --> 01:17:02,195
Has nothing to do with you. 

613
01:17:04,856 --> 01:17:05,972
You must stop seeing her. 

614
01:17:07,203 --> 01:17:08,146
You understand? 

615
01:17:09,523 --> 01:17:11,141
You understand? 

616
01:17:52,978 --> 01:17:54,477
I'm happy to betray your family? 

617
01:17:56,828 --> 01:17:58,171
Talk to you, motherfucker. 

618
01:17:58,206 --> 01:18:00,637
- Do not betray anyone. 
- You are worse than your father. 

619
01:18:01,590 --> 01:18:03,040
I had to get home? 

620
01:18:04,159 --> 01:18:06,280
I will burn in hell with him. 

621

Tell me that's not true. 

625

Tell me that is a lie.

Even you slept with him? 

627

Santiago, Dad is on its way to you. 

628

Go away and come get me.

In what class are you? 

630
01:20:26,636 --> 01:20:27,768
In the eighth grade.

Scar is very bad. 

639

You fought and won.

<i> Maria, come on. </ i> 

663
01:24:20,613 --> 01:24:21,624
<i> have to leave. </ i> 

664
01:24:23,228 --> 01:24:24,029
Come <i>. </ i> 

665
01:24:28,193 --> 01:24:30,055
Wait. Can ... 

666
01:24:32,162 --> 01:24:33,758
Can I stay a bit? 

667
01:24:34,625 --> 01:24:35,728
<i> I understand. What he said </ i> 

668
01:24:36,639 --> 01:24:39,082
It <i> his wife and wants to stay little. </ i> 

669
01:24:42,603 --> 01:24:43,498
Two minutes <i>. </ i> 

670
01:25:01,607 --> 01:25:02,693
Santiago ... 

671
01:25:06,752 --> 01:25:07,925
I am ... 

672
01:25:11,076 --> 01:25:12,299
Mariana. 

673
01:25:34,607 --> 01:25:36,215
You have to die, is not it? 

674
01:25:44,915 --> 01:25:47,255
Because if you die, 
I do not know what to do with it. 

675
01:25:54,359 --> 01:25:56,204
Only one can look into my eyes. 

676
01:26:00,100 --> 01:26:01,272
She needs you. 

677
01:26:03,417 --> 01:26:04,588
And I need you. 

678
01:26:18,329 --> 01:26:19,652
I'm very scared. 

679
01:26:24,842 --> 01:26:27,845
I'm afraid of myself and can not ... 

680
01:26:28,104 --> 01:26:29,674
can not run. 

681
01:26:41,044 --> 01:26:42,220
I killed. 

682
01:26:45,312 --> 01:26:47,430
I killed your father 
and my mother. 

683
01:26:50,149 --> 01:26:51,661
I did, but ... 

684
01:26:53,389 --> 01:26:55,461
I can not escape the smell ... 

685
01:26:56,114 --> 01:26:58,410
when burning them, can not escape it. 

686
01:27:17,106 --> 01:27:19,215
Why did you want to come back here? 

687
01:27:20,837 --> 01:27:21,740
Why? 

688
01:27:26,301 --> 01:27:27,333
Why? 

689
01:28:30,928 --> 01:28:31,931
Mariana, where are you going? 

690
01:28:32,402 --> 01:28:34,724
Let me go! 

691
01:28:34,993 --> 01:28:35,944
I have to tell Dad. 

692
01:28:37,453 --> 01:28:38,427
Tell him what you want. 

693
01:28:55,867 --> 01:28:58,582
You know, you sleep in your room. 
I miss you here. 

694
01:28:59,636 --> 01:29:00,454
No, it is okay. 

695
01:29:08,296 --> 01:29:09,302
What happened? 

696
01:29:13,538 --> 01:29:15,224
Nothing, I got burnt once. 

697
01:29:16,013 --> 01:29:18,237
Dad has the same scar in the same place. 

698
01:29:19,800 --> 01:29:21,618
He said he did this 
lest you forget again. 

699
01:29:24,613 --> 01:29:25,516
Just me. 

700
01:29:26,744 --> 01:29:27,994
And I have a scar. 

701
01:29:35,578 --> 01:29:36,525
What happened? 

702
01:29:37,524 --> 01:29:38,724
I fell when I was three years. 

703
01:29:46,929 --> 01:29:48,222
A stay with us? 

704
01:29:54,166 --> 01:29:55,654
I do not know. You talk to him. 

705
01:29:55,689 --> 01:29:56,996
You know, a long time. 

706
01:29:58,078 --> 01:29:59,485
You have left, right? 

707
01:30:06,228 --> 01:30:07,146
I'm tired. 

708
01:30:09,943 --> 01:30:10,801
Good night. 

709
01:30:16,175 --> 01:30:17,175
Good night. 

710
01:31:31,314 --> 01:31:32,316
Where are we? 

711
01:31:33,777 --> 01:31:34,919
That is my school. 

712
01:31:37,233 --> 01:31:38,672
What you do there? 

713
01:31:41,023 --> 01:31:41,965
I got quiet. 

714
01:31:44,438 --> 01:31:45,802
Not one to ever have peace. 

715
01:31:49,274 --> 01:31:50,247
I am pregnant. 

716
01:31:53,635 --> 01:31:55,759
- What? 
- I'm pregnant and do not want the baby. 

717
01:31:56,619 --> 01:31:59,528
We can go to Mexico. All three. 

718
01:31:59,779 --> 01:32:01,784
No. I do not want. I can not have. 

719
01:32:31,258 --> 01:32:32,629
Can I talk to you a minute? 

720
01:32:47,478 --> 01:32:48,336
Maria ... 

721
01:32:49,827 --> 01:32:51,613
You think you can forgive me for not ... 

722
01:32:53,489 --> 01:32:55,280
I missed all these years? 

723
01:32:58,710 --> 01:33:01,385
I left because 
I was afraid I would be like me. 

724
01:33:04,231 --> 01:33:05,588
As you become like me. 

725
01:33:09,774 --> 01:33:11,105
You think you can forgive me? 

726
01:33:12,386 --> 01:33:13,326
Please ... 

727
01:33:19,657 --> 01:33:21,012
I want to go to see my father now. 

728
01:33:29,805 --> 01:33:31,426
<i> - Hello. 
- Hello, Doctor. </ I> 

729
01:33:31,461 --> 01:33:32,325
<i> How is he? </ i> 

730
01:33:32,577 --> 01:33:33,978
<i> I managed to drain the infection. </ i> 

731
01:33:35,787 --> 01:33:36,819
<i> Not to lose my leg? </ i> 

732
01:33:37,341 --> 01:33:38,395
<i> No, not to lose my leg. </ i> 

733
01:33:39,011 --> 01:33:41,133
<i> need to track how you move, 
but for the moment is right. </ i> 

734
01:33:41,463 --> 01:33:42,282
<i> I can see him </ i> 

735
01:33:42,571 --> 01:33:43,569
<i> Yes, you can go to see. </ i> 

736
01:33:44,123 --> 01:33:45,364
Dad will be fine. 

737
01:33:52,509 --> 01:33:53,380
Live?
