disassociate with London Diamond,

the table at the U.N.,

and so on and so on,

168
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:01,980
but secretly
we extend our contract

169

and keep it a strictly
private matter,

170

That's not bad at all.

you told about this?

No doubt impressive, but
it's making people nervous.

Yes.

Mr. Hobbs, I'm flattered,

I... I have a proposal
to put to you.

that you want?

that you qualify.

permission to speak with me.

Say I know nothing
about it, unsolicited.

00:24:47,220 --> 00:24:48,500
Was I?

323
00:24:48,540 --> 00:24:51,420
Why do you want to steal
from the company?

324
00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:52,820
Who said I did?

325
00:24:52,860 --> 00:24:55,300
Hypothetically.

326
00:24:55,380 --> 00:24:56,580
War and plunder,

327
00:24:56,660 --> 00:24:59,260
the two most reliable
sources of income.

328
00:24:59,300 --> 00:25:01,340
I didn't realize
we were at war.

I shall retire
to a hearty pat on the back

332
00:25:11,940 --> 00:25:14,100
and a not to hearty pension,

a situation
in dire need of attention.

334
00:25:17,060 --> 00:25:20,020
So money, plain
and simple?

335
00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:23,380
Suppose I wanted to do
something for my wife.

336

Your wife
who died 15 years ago?

337
00:25:25,540 --> 00:25:27,220
The one you're
happily married to?

338
00:25:27,260 --> 00:25:29,180
Lovely. You did
your homework.

339
00:25:29,220 --> 00:25:30,740
I guess you would.

340
00:25:30,780 --> 00:25:32,580
What else
did you uncover?

341
00:25:32,660 --> 00:25:33,980
That you're far
from stupid,

342
00:25:34,020 --> 00:25:36,220

apprentice under your father,

Oh, yes, married at 21 and years
later when your wife became ill,

345
00:25:41,860 --> 00:25:43,420
you took the night job
at London Diamonds

346
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:45,980
so you could spend
your days by her side.

347
00:25:46,020 --> 00:25:48,220
You never did use
those qualifications.

348
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:52,940
Clever, Miss Quinn.

349
00:25:53,020 --> 00:25:54,260
Clever.

350
00:25:54,300 --> 00:25:55,980
How do you know
I won't turn you in?

351
00:25:56,060 --> 00:25:58,060
Are we still speaking
hypothetically?

352
00:25:58,140 --> 00:26:00,540
I mean, what makes you think
you can pull off such a thing?

353
00:26:00,580 --> 00:26:03,100
Well, simply because
I have a plan.

354
00:26:12,220 --> 00:26:16,620
What I propose involves
the least possible risk

355
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:20,620
because we don't have to
change our normal routines.

356
00:26:22,140 --> 00:26:25,740
Each night at 9:00...

357
00:26:25,820 --> 00:26:27,740
they lock the front doors,

358
00:26:27,820 --> 00:26:29,420
which means,
that for 10 hours,

359
00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:32,380
no one can go in
or out of the building.

360
00:26:32,460 --> 00:26:35,020
They increase the security
on the main floor

361
00:26:35,100 --> 00:26:37,820
but on the lower floor they
just keep these two guards,

362
00:26:37,900 --> 00:26:41,180
here and here
by the lift,

363
00:26:41,220 --> 00:26:43,500
which is the sole
point of access.

364
00:26:43,580 --> 00:26:46,380
You intend to go
for the vault?

365
00:26:46,460 --> 00:26:47,900
That's where
the diamonds are.

366
00:26:47,980 --> 00:26:49,180
You can't be serious.

367
00:26:49,220 --> 00:26:53,180
Generally, each evening I
start on the fourth floor

368
00:26:53,260 --> 00:26:55,740
and work
me way down, see?

369
00:26:58,900 --> 00:27:00,540
Nice day today.

370
00:27:00,620 --> 00:27:02,780
Once through
the outer floors

371
00:27:02,820 --> 00:27:05,820
I'm escorted
to the sub basement.

372
00:27:11,980 --> 00:27:14,300
The next few hours are
spent on rubbish collection,

373
00:27:14,380 --> 00:27:18,460
mopping, waxing, minor
repair and maintenance.

374
00:27:24,940 --> 00:27:28,820
During that time,
I'll work mostly unattended.

375
00:27:31,300 --> 00:27:33,420
Once an hour or so,
someone checks up on me.

376
00:27:37,020 --> 00:27:39,580
Otherwise, I'm
left entirely to myself.

377
00:27:39,660 --> 00:27:40,860
I mean, in theory,

378
00:27:40,940 --> 00:27:44,060
I could take off all my
clothes and walk around naked.

379
00:27:44,140 --> 00:27:45,820
A frightening thought,
Miss Quinn.

380
00:27:45,900 --> 00:27:47,420
Don't dwell on it.

381
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:49,300
I'll try not to.

382
00:27:49,340 --> 00:27:51,500
I've saved the vault
hallway for last.

383
00:27:51,580 --> 00:27:54,580

to a circular door,

384
00:27:54,620 --> 00:27:56,060
behind which

385
00:27:56,140 --> 00:28:01,500
lies one of the largest singular
deposits of riches on earth.

386
00:28:03,420 --> 00:28:05,540
For 16 years
I've been working

387
00:28:05,620 --> 00:28:07,860

breath of that door,

388
00:28:07,900 --> 00:28:12,340
and for 16 years I've never
opened it, not once.

389
00:28:12,380 --> 00:28:15,620
You couldn't if you wanted
to, not without the codes.

390
00:28:15,700 --> 00:28:18,500
The codes are changed weekly
and entrusted to only two people.

391
00:28:18,580 --> 00:28:22,620
Mr. Eaton, lifelong company
servant, portrait of reliability.

392

Rumor has it that the swiss use
his pulse to set their clocks by.

393
00:28:27,140 --> 00:28:30,740
And, of course, Sir Milton
Kendrick Ashtoncroft,

394
00:28:30,780 --> 00:28:33,300
aging ruler of everything
that daylight touches.

395
00:28:33,340 --> 00:28:36,660
And you plan to obtain
the codes how?

396
00:28:36,700 --> 00:28:38,780
That's where you come in,
Miss Quinn.

397
00:28:38,820 --> 00:28:42,740
Until recently, this was
supposed to be a solo operation.

398
00:28:44,220 --> 00:28:46,900
A year ago, quite by accident,

399
00:28:46,940 --> 00:28:51,060
I discovered that Sir Milton kept
the codes concealed in his desk.

400
00:29:12,300 --> 00:29:15,100
Then some months back,
they were gone.

401

Night after night,

402

I searched the office,
but they never turned up.

Why'd you wait?

404
00:29:22,620 --> 00:29:24,380
Why not do it while
you had the chance?

405
00:29:24,420 --> 00:29:27,580
Oh, I've asked myself that
question a thousand times.

406
00:29:27,620 --> 00:29:31,060
I told you, I'm...
I'm not courageous.

407
00:29:31,100 --> 00:29:34,140
But my hesitating
will be your gain.

408
00:29:34,220 --> 00:29:35,380
Will it?

409
00:29:35,420 --> 00:29:36,740
And what will
that require?

410
00:29:36,820 --> 00:29:39,180
Here, proof of conviction.

411
00:29:39,260 --> 00:29:42,260
You are on the, uh,
guest list, are you?

You suspect he keeps
the codes at home?

415
00:29:50,580 --> 00:29:53,100
On Saturday, go to his study

416
00:29:53,180 --> 00:29:55,460
and look under the center
drawer in his desk.

417
00:29:55,540 --> 00:29:57,940
This is ridiculous.

418
00:29:57,980 --> 00:29:59,620
Say I did find the codes

419
00:29:59,700 --> 00:30:02,500
and you were able to slip in
and out of the vault undetected.

420
00:30:02,580 --> 00:30:05,060
How would you get the
diamonds out of the building?

How much would
you like it to hold?

What's the price of revenge?

424
00:30:20,260 --> 00:30:22,620
Difficult, eh?

425
00:30:22,660 --> 00:30:24,580
Would a million pound do?

426
00:30:26,260 --> 00:30:28,180
Each?
I should think so.

427
00:30:28,220 --> 00:30:30,820
They wouldn't even
notice that much.

428
00:30:30,900 --> 00:30:32,100
Well, by then...

429
00:30:32,180 --> 00:30:34,660
I'll be retired and
you'll have been let go.

sound so easy.

No, it isn't.

No doubt losing sleep over our
somewhat top heavy inventory.

447

Oh, I don't think Sinclair's
the type to lose sleep.

448
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:15,300
It's rather unnerving
to consider a man

with that history as London
diamond's greatest guarantor.

Of course, he's

00:34:06,300 --> 00:34:08,180
Purely by design.

482
00:34:08,220 --> 00:34:11,260
You've stumbled into my lair,
my sanctuary of sorts.

483
00:34:11,300 --> 00:34:13,460
Yes, I think I know
what you mean.

484
00:34:14,940 --> 00:34:16,820
At least the evening
is a success.

485
00:34:16,860 --> 00:34:19,060
Your father's spared
no expense.

486
00:34:19,100 --> 00:34:21,540
Never does,
always first class,

487
00:34:21,620 --> 00:34:24,500
so long as it's discreet
and doesn't attract attention.

488
00:34:24,540 --> 00:34:28,340
Yes, he's famous
for his discretion.

489
00:34:28,380 --> 00:34:31,340
Is it true he paid 100
pounds to the families

490
00:34:31,420 --> 00:34:33,220
of the miners
who died in protest?

491
00:34:34,580 --> 00:34:36,860
Anonymously.

492
00:34:36,940 --> 00:34:39,300
Pulled the bullets
from the caskets.

493
00:34:40,980 --> 00:34:42,500
Should be a discount
for that.

494
00:34:43,860 --> 00:34:45,700
What sort of man
does such a thing?

495
00:34:47,540 --> 00:34:50,100
A man of conscience.

496
00:37:38,660 --> 00:37:40,460
Miss Quinn: Mr. Hobbs.

497
00:37:41,660 --> 00:37:44,860
I'm having trouble with
the heat in my office.

498
00:37:44,900 --> 00:37:47,540
Uh, Miss Quinn,
do you want...

499
00:37:47,580 --> 00:37:51,420
more or less heat
in your office?

500
00:37:51,500 --> 00:37:55,500
If we do this, I want
to know every last detail.

501
00:37:55,580 --> 00:37:56,860
Understand?

502
00:37:58,380 --> 00:37:59,740
Ok.

503
00:38:25,180 --> 00:38:27,900
Man: Now, if you just
lock it off under there.

504

[Children playing]

505
00:38:48,100 --> 00:38:49,660
We have to call it off.

506
00:38:49,740 --> 00:38:52,380
They've installed
security cameras.

507
00:38:52,460 --> 00:38:54,980
Closed Circuit Television
monitoring everything.

508
00:38:55,060 --> 00:38:57,660
I've been with them all
morning showing interest.

509
00:38:57,740 --> 00:38:59,060
Cameras in the building?

510
00:38:59,100 --> 00:39:01,180
Yes, inside, outside,
halls, lobby.

511
00:39:01,220 --> 00:39:02,140
In the vault?

512
00:39:02,220 --> 00:39:03,260
No, but
the vault corridor.

513
00:39:03,340 --> 00:39:04,940
They don't want
security guards staring

514
00:39:05,020 --> 00:39:06,260
at mounds
of diamonds all day.

515
00:39:06,300 --> 00:39:07,260
Can you blame them?

516
00:39:07,340 --> 00:39:09,260
Oh, security cameras,
goodness gracious.

517
00:39:09,340 --> 00:39:10,780
What'll they
think up next?

518
00:39:10,820 --> 00:39:12,060
Is there any way
around them?

519
00:39:12,140 --> 00:39:13,820
No, absolutely not.

520
00:39:13,900 --> 00:39:14,900
No?

521
00:39:14,940 --> 00:39:16,380
There are eight
separate cameras

522
00:39:16,460 --> 00:39:18,020
covering the entire
sub basement,

523
00:39:18,100 --> 00:39:20,660
including one dedicated
to the vault corridor.

524
00:39:20,700 --> 00:39:22,540
The cameras link
to the guard station,

525
00:39:22,620 --> 00:39:26,580
and Eaton has a man on watch 24
hours a day, seven days a week.

526
00:39:27,740 --> 00:39:29,180
Basement's here.

527
00:39:29,260 --> 00:39:31,620
We've got reception,
boardroom, the corridor.

528
00:39:31,700 --> 00:39:34,460
So you'll just have to
reconsider that pension of yours.

529
00:39:34,500 --> 00:39:36,660
All right.
So, fool proof, eh?

530
00:39:36,700 --> 00:39:39,740
And you came all the way
over to the wrong side

531
00:39:39,820 --> 00:39:41,180
of town to tell me...

532
00:39:42,460 --> 00:39:44,180
when you could've
told me tonight.

533
00:39:45,500 --> 00:39:47,220
You've seen a way,
haven't you?

534
00:39:47,260 --> 00:39:48,980
I have not, Mr. Hobbs.

535
00:39:49,020 --> 00:39:51,540
Your tenacity reminds
me of my wife.

536
00:39:54,220 --> 00:39:56,060
Why are you being
so persistent?

537
00:39:56,100 --> 00:39:58,500
Because I hate
English winters.

538
00:40:00,100 --> 00:40:02,540
Now, tell me how
it can be done.

539
00:40:04,860 --> 00:40:06,540
All right. There's
one possibility,

540
00:40:06,620 --> 00:40:07,780
but I'm telling you,
it won't work.

541
00:40:07,860 --> 00:40:10,620
Although there are eight
cameras in the sub basement,

542
00:40:10,660 --> 00:40:13,380
only four images are on
screen at any one time.

543
00:40:13,460 --> 00:40:14,580
Four on, four off,

544
00:40:14,620 --> 00:40:17,140
and since the images cycle
in 15-second intervals,

545
00:40:17,180 --> 00:40:18,660
they reappear
in the order they leave.

546
00:40:18,740 --> 00:40:20,260
So each image
is off-screen for...

547
00:40:20,340 --> 00:40:21,700
60 seconds, yeah?

548
00:40:21,780 --> 00:40:24,100
Yeah, 60 seconds,
but that's not enough time.

549
00:40:24,180 --> 00:40:25,220
Enough time?

550
00:40:25,300 --> 00:40:26,580
I'll be in that vault
in 10 seconds flat.

551
00:40:26,620 --> 00:40:28,340
You can't be standing
outside the vault

552
00:40:28,380 --> 00:40:29,780
when the image goes
off screen

553
00:40:29,820 --> 00:40:31,380
and be nowhere in sight
when it reappears.

554
00:40:31,420 --> 00:40:33,300
You have to start
at the end of the corridor,

555
00:40:33,340 --> 00:40:34,660
and that's 40 yards long.

556
00:40:34,740 --> 00:40:37,380
Well, I don't have
a problem with that.

557
00:40:37,460 --> 00:40:39,140
With all due respect,
Mr. Hobbs,

558
00:40:39,220 --> 00:40:41,220
you can hardly walk,
let alone run.

559
00:40:41,300 --> 00:40:43,420
I'm telling you,
I can do it.

560
00:40:46,460 --> 00:40:48,740
This has gone too far.

561
00:40:48,820 --> 00:40:50,460
I'm sorry.

562
00:40:50,540 --> 00:40:54,660
You're involved now,
whether you like it or not.

563
00:40:54,740 --> 00:40:56,060
I beg your pardon.

564
00:40:56,100 --> 00:40:59,300
You gave me the code, Miss
Quinn, so you're involved.

565
00:40:59,380 --> 00:41:01,500
Make no mistake.

566
00:41:01,580 --> 00:41:02,820
I'm going through
with this.

567
00:41:02,900 --> 00:41:05,420
And don't you pretend
to me that you don't want it,

568
00:41:05,500 --> 00:41:07,340
because you want
it more than I do.

569
00:41:07,420 --> 00:41:10,180
You want a life that means
something that adds up.

570
00:41:10,260 --> 00:41:14,180
And you know that this is the
only way you're going to get it.

571
00:41:14,260 --> 00:41:18,140
Miss Quinn,
you said it yourself.

572
00:41:18,180 --> 00:41:19,820
They're never going
to notice it.

573
00:41:24,540 --> 00:41:25,980
This is how it'll work.

574
00:41:26,060 --> 00:41:28,460
Tomorrow we'll
synchronize our watches,

575
00:41:28,540 --> 00:41:29,660
but it has
to be tomorrow

576
00:41:29,700 --> 00:41:32,380
before they realize
the flaw in the system.

577
00:41:32,420 --> 00:41:34,620
At the exact moment you're
at the vault corridor,

578
00:41:34,660 --> 00:41:36,180
I'll call
the guard station.

579
00:41:36,220 --> 00:41:38,980
That should buy you at
least 30 more seconds.

580
00:41:40,740 --> 00:41:43,980
When this is over, I think
best we not speak again.
