1
00:01:06,811 --> 00:01:08,154
America...

2
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:13,458
I say to the people of America.

3
00:01:16,411 --> 00:01:20,822
This moment is our chance to...

4
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:27,658
Enough.

5
00:01:30,084 --> 00:01:33,620
To make of our own lives
what we will. It is...

6
00:01:37,082 --> 00:01:38,527
That pushes us forward.

7
00:01:42,552 --> 00:01:44,588
The American promise alive.

10
00:01:45,419 --> 00:01:48,760
It is that promise that's
always set this country apart.

11
00:01:49,486 --> 00:01:51,488
It's a promise
that says each of us has the freedom...

12
00:01:51,588 --> 00:01:54,257
to make of our own lives what we will.

13
00:02:13,758 --> 00:02:17,668
You're late!
You're fucking 3 hours late!

14
00:02:17,758 --> 00:02:19,861
Don't start on me.

15
00:02:20,125 --> 00:02:22,105
You couldn't
have gotten me somebody else?

16
00:02:22,193 --> 00:02:24,195
This item looks like shit,
and he's got no fucking manners.

17
00:02:24,295 --> 00:02:25,795
I'm not gonna
put up with shit like this.

18
00:02:25,894 --> 00:02:27,736
All right, look, you asked me
to get somebody that was all right.

19
00:02:27,829 --> 00:02:29,533
You know, Russell here,
he's kind of a wise ass,

20
00:02:29,627 --> 00:02:31,104
but he's all right if you can stand him.

21
00:02:31,194 --> 00:02:33,470
Yeah, and a guy like you,
you want a job done...

22
00:02:33,562 --> 00:02:35,370
you don't
have the balls to do it yourself,

23
00:02:35,463 --> 00:02:37,407
I think you ought to try pretty hard to.

24
00:02:38,696 --> 00:02:42,106
I don't like this guy.
He's too fucking fresh for my blood.

25
00:02:42,197 --> 00:02:44,404
Russell, will you shut the fuck up
and stop jerking the guy's chain?

26
00:02:44,499 --> 00:02:45,669
He's trying to do us a favor here.

27
00:02:45,765 --> 00:02:46,537
He's trying to do us a fucking favor?

28
00:02:46,630 --> 00:02:48,437
Yeah, he's trying to do us a favor.

29
00:02:48,530 --> 00:02:50,907
I thought
he wanted us to do him a favor.

30
00:02:51,165 --> 00:02:55,339
Is that the straight shit, Squirrel?
You trying to do me a favor?

31
00:02:55,434 --> 00:02:56,504
Get the fuck out!

32
00:02:56,602 --> 00:03:00,136
Man, what are you
talking to me like that? Come on.

33
00:03:00,235 --> 00:03:03,213
You sell people dry cleaning
and you talk to them like that?

34
00:03:03,634 --> 00:03:05,339
You know something,
the two guys I get to do this...

35
00:03:05,434 --> 00:03:08,378
they're gonna out up about 30,
I figure 30K.

36
00:03:08,468 --> 00:03:09,878
And Australians like him, Frankie...

37
00:03:10,135 --> 00:03:12,774
Australians like him
I can buy for 80 cents a dozen.

38
00:03:12,870 --> 00:03:14,643
They throw another one in for free.

39
00:03:14,736 --> 00:03:16,682
So you know what you do, Frankie?
You get me another guy...

40
00:03:16,772 --> 00:03:18,547
cause I'm not gonna
put up with this kind of shit.

41
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:21,140
Look, John,
it'll be all right, okay? Trust me.

42
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:23,772
Hey, my friend, you picked
the wrong guy for a thing once.

43
00:03:23,871 --> 00:03:25,712
You remember that?
You remember the doctor?

44
00:03:25,804 --> 00:03:28,444
And I knew, I just knew
that this was the wrong guy.

45
00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:29,814
What do I do? I take him anyway.

46
00:03:29,906 --> 00:03:32,181
John, I need the dough.
Don't fuck around with me like that.

47
00:03:32,274 --> 00:03:35,410
And after 7 years in the can
and my kids are growing up...

48
00:03:35,507 --> 00:03:37,418
and my business isn't doing
what it should be, you know,

49
00:03:37,509 --> 00:03:39,419
I can't get that back.

50
00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:42,783
So from now on, I'm taking
my time and that's all there is to it.

51
00:03:42,876 --> 00:03:44,751
I had my last fuck-up.

52
00:03:46,642 --> 00:03:49,884
Call me Thursday. Thursday I'll know.

53
00:04:10,216 --> 00:04:12,287
I've got to give
a new direction to this economy.

54
00:04:12,884 --> 00:04:15,918
Come on. That a girl. Good girl. Look.

55
00:04:16,183 --> 00:04:19,523
All right, you're here.
So we going out there or what?

56
00:04:19,615 --> 00:04:20,320
That depends.

57
00:04:20,416 --> 00:04:21,292
Don't depend on me

58
00:04:21,383 --> 00:04:23,363
it's Thursday.
You coming with me or not?

59
00:04:23,452 --> 00:04:27,397
Man. Fuck that guy. He's a dick.

60
00:04:27,487 --> 00:04:30,828
Doesn't know if he wants me or not.
Well, I don't need him, mate.

61
00:04:30,919 --> 00:04:32,762
I got my own thing going on, mate.

62
00:04:32,855 --> 00:04:36,229
Me and Kenny, you know,
we're snatching these dogs...

63
00:04:36,653 --> 00:04:39,222
purebreds,
and selling 'em down in Florida.

64
00:04:39,321 --> 00:04:41,128
I got 5 grand in the kit, mate.

65
00:04:41,221 --> 00:04:44,463
When I get 7, I'm gonna go
and buy an ounce of smack...

66
00:04:44,790 --> 00:04:46,734
and I'm gonna become a dealer.

67
00:04:46,823 --> 00:04:49,735
Plus this afternoon...

68
00:04:49,825 --> 00:04:52,200
I got a girl I can go and fuck.

69
00:04:52,889 --> 00:04:53,799
Right?

70
00:04:53,890 --> 00:04:57,699
So I'm thinking ifs a choice,
you know. Oh, tough one.

71
00:04:57,791 --> 00:04:59,201
Am I gonna go and fuck a girl

72
00:04:59,291 --> 00:05:01,667
or am I gonna go to a meeting
with the Squirrel?

73
00:05:01,758 --> 00:05:03,759
Oh, fuck a girl, meeting with Squirrel.

74
00:05:03,860 --> 00:05:06,635
Fuck Squirrel.
I think I'll go fuck the girl.

75
00:05:08,261 --> 00:05:09,705
I'd like to see this girl.

76
00:05:09,795 --> 00:05:11,931
The kind of girl you can
screw off an ad in the paper?

77
00:05:12,194 --> 00:05:15,366
Beautiful. Probably got a couple
of handfuls of broken glass in there.

78
00:05:15,462 --> 00:05:18,736
Well, yeah, these girls, you see 'em...

79
00:05:18,829 --> 00:05:19,864
you probably wouldn't want to rape them,

80
00:05:20,131 --> 00:05:22,735
but all the plumbing works just fine.

81
00:05:28,697 --> 00:05:30,470
So I guess you're not coming then.

82
00:05:30,563 --> 00:05:34,736
Look, go ahead, see if you can
get him to tell you anything about it.

83
00:05:34,831 --> 00:05:37,710
If you still like it then, then I'm in.

84
00:05:37,801 --> 00:05:41,507
If not, if he doesn't want me, I'm out.

85
00:05:41,602 --> 00:05:43,274
But I'm not wasting an afternoon on it.

86
00:05:43,369 --> 00:05:45,368
That much, I'm not doing.

87
00:05:47,568 --> 00:05:50,171
There it is.
-All right, fuck it.

88
00:05:53,201 --> 00:05:56,146
I don't know. I've been asking around
about him, you know and...

89
00:05:56,236 --> 00:05:57,237
I mean, not too many people.

90
00:05:57,337 --> 00:05:58,281
Now,I don't want
everybody to think that...

91
00:05:58,371 --> 00:05:59,372
maybe I got something in mind

92
00:05:59,472 --> 00:06:02,609
and well, nobody knows this guy.

93
00:06:02,906 --> 00:06:06,473
I'm afraid he's not the kind of guy
we want to have in with us.

94
00:06:07,638 --> 00:06:08,946
See, these people
are not the kind of people

95
00:06:09,206 --> 00:06:10,310
that are around a bank or something.

96
00:06:10,407 --> 00:06:12,783
They expect maybe someday some guy's
gonna come in there and rob them

97
00:06:12,875 --> 00:06:14,285
and it's not their money.

98
00:06:14,375 --> 00:06:16,182
These are not
these kind of people at all.

99
00:06:16,275 --> 00:06:18,513
They see somebody come in there
that's not absolutely cool...

100
00:06:18,608 --> 00:06:21,213
that they can tell right off
doesn't know what he's doing...

101
00:06:21,309 --> 00:06:23,512
they're liable,
some of them to get up off their ass

102
00:06:23,608 --> 00:06:25,246
and start making trouble.

103
00:06:25,343 --> 00:06:26,649
They're gonna fucking shoot somebody,

104
00:06:26,742 --> 00:06:27,946
for Christ's sake,
and I don't want that.

105
00:06:28,208 --> 00:06:29,619
There's no reason for that, you know?

106
00:06:29,710 --> 00:06:31,383
You don't get any more money
or anything like that.

107
00:06:31,478 --> 00:06:32,616
It don't make any sense.

108
00:06:32,713 --> 00:06:36,453
Yeah, I don't mean anything.
At least you got an idea, you know?

109
00:06:36,547 --> 00:06:38,150
You still coming up dry?

110
00:06:38,248 --> 00:06:40,191
Yeah. You know what I did?

111
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:41,348
I goes down to probation,

112
00:06:41,445 --> 00:06:43,549
like I actually believe in all that shit
they're handing out there.

113
00:06:43,646 --> 00:06:44,588
“Here's something for you.

114
00:06:44,678 --> 00:06:46,419
Place in Halbrook needs assemblers...“

115
00:06:46,514 --> 00:06:48,822
“$130 a week,
4:00 to midnight, steady work.“

116
00:06:48,914 --> 00:06:51,586
“lt'll keep you
out of trouble.“ Beautiful.

117
00:06:51,681 --> 00:06:53,558
Well, I live in Somerville.

118
00:06:53,650 --> 00:06:56,219
How the hell am I gonna get to
Halbrook in the middle of the afternoon?

119
00:06:56,317 --> 00:06:57,886
Never mind,
for Christ's sake, how the fuck...

120
00:06:58,151 --> 00:06:59,457
am I gonna get home
in the middle of the night?

121
00:06:59,550 --> 00:07:02,585
“Buy a car.“
“With what? I haven't got no money.“

122
00:07:02,683 --> 00:07:04,162
What the fuck am I gonna buy a car with?

123
00:07:04,252 --> 00:07:06,752
Why the fuck they think
I need a job in the first place?

124
00:07:06,851 --> 00:07:07,852
Fucking assholes.

125
00:07:07,952 --> 00:07:10,157
You know, then I see Russell.
You know, he's coming right along.

126
00:07:10,253 --> 00:07:13,288
You know, probably buy himself
a hotel in the next couple weeks or so.

127
00:07:13,386 --> 00:07:14,456
Not on clogs.

128
00:07:14,554 --> 00:07:15,623
He's just doing that.

129
00:07:15,721 --> 00:07:18,357
He's gonna use that to buy
some stuff, soon as he gets enough.

130
00:07:18,453 --> 00:07:19,624
He's gonna get nabbed.

131
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:22,562
He ought to go in the drugstore
and buy himself a new toothbrush

132
00:07:22,654 --> 00:07:24,360
cause he's gonna need it.

133
00:07:24,455 --> 00:07:26,435
Well, John, you know,
you're the guy with the angle.

134
00:07:26,524 --> 00:07:28,468
Tell me what the angle is.

135
00:07:33,624 --> 00:07:36,624
You think dog-lover there
can handle a card game?

136
00:07:37,957 --> 00:07:40,799
Shit, those fucking things?
Those things are protected.

137
00:07:40,892 --> 00:07:43,201
You cant do those things
unless you're so fucking stupid...

138
00:07:43,293 --> 00:07:45,828
you actually like everybody
going around trying to off you.

139
00:07:46,427 --> 00:07:47,496
There's one you can do.

140
00:07:47,594 --> 00:07:50,266
John, there's 10 I can do.
I know of at least 10 I can do..

141
00:07:50,362 --> 00:07:51,431
But then after, I'm gonna have

142
00:07:51,529 --> 00:07:53,528
at least 8 hot ginzos out
looking for me.

143
00:07:53,628 --> 00:07:56,196
No, no, not this one,
because the minute it fucking happens..

144
00:07:56,294 --> 00:07:58,331
They're gonna know right off who did it.

145
00:07:58,428 --> 00:07:59,372
For some reason, John,

146
00:07:59,463 --> 00:08:00,872
that don't
make me feel better, you know.

147
00:08:00,962 --> 00:08:03,407
No, not us. They're not even
gonna be thinking it might be us.

148
00:08:03,496 --> 00:08:04,497
They're gonna pick one guy right away...

149
00:08:04,597 --> 00:08:06,632
go whack him out
and that's gonna be end of it.

150
00:08:06,731 --> 00:08:11,198
You and I are gonna out up about
$40,000, $50,000, no fucking sweat.

151
00:08:11,830 --> 00:08:14,605
I don't know how I goes for
setting somebody up, you know?

152
00:08:14,698 --> 00:08:17,267
You're not setting him up.
He set himself up.

153
00:08:17,366 --> 00:08:18,743
Markie Trattman runs this game.

00:08:18,834 --> 00:08:19,972
This is Markie's second game.

155
00:08:20,235 --> 00:08:22,404
The first one got knocked over...

156
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:24,638
and it was Markie who did it.

157
00:08:25,769 --> 00:08:28,804
See, four years ago,
Markie was running this game...

158
00:08:28,903 --> 00:08:31,574
and he sees all the cash
flying around the room...

159
00:08:32,801 --> 00:08:36,303
and he thinks... “Jeez, two guys
with shotguns and stocking masks...

160
00:08:36,403 --> 00:08:38,506
could come in here and really clean up.“

161
00:08:38,803 --> 00:08:41,750
So he thinks,
“What the fuck,“ and he does it.

162
00:08:42,641 --> 00:08:45,344
Put your hands on the fucking table
with your fucking money!

163
00:08:45,438 --> 00:08:47,972
Mike, all right, all right,
give him the money. Go, Mike!

164
00:08:48,238 --> 00:08:50,682
Now all the games have to shut down.
it's a real pain in the ass.

165
00:08:50,772 --> 00:08:53,275
Total fucking economic collapse.

166
00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:55,544
Everyone's pissing and moaning.

167
00:08:55,642 --> 00:08:59,517
No one's got any money.
Everybody's, you know, really upset.

168
00:09:00,441 --> 00:09:01,943
Fuck me.

169
00:09:02,809 --> 00:09:04,254
Markie!

170
00:09:05,443 --> 00:09:07,886
They send Dillon out to find out
who did it.

171
00:09:09,377 --> 00:09:10,853
The fuck are you looking at?

172
00:09:11,643 --> 00:09:12,713
Markie!

173
00:09:13,511 --> 00:09:14,785
What?

174
00:09:15,945 --> 00:09:17,424
And Dillon interrogates Markie.

175
00:09:17,513 --> 00:09:18,889
Hey, what's going on? Hey!
-Hey.

176
00:09:18,980 --> 00:09:20,887
You knock over the card game?

177
00:09:21,846 --> 00:09:25,256
Jesus Christ! What the fuck?

178
00:09:27,446 --> 00:09:28,618
Dillon!

179
00:09:30,282 --> 00:09:31,758
And Markie holds up under questioning.

180
00:09:31,847 --> 00:09:35,191
Dillon, what the fuck?
What's this all about?

181
00:09:35,283 --> 00:09:37,522
Dillon can't work it out,
who did it, so they think...

182
00:09:37,616 --> 00:09:39,788
“What the fuck.
it's just one of those things.“

183
00:09:39,884 --> 00:09:41,362
Let's have a beer.

184
00:09:42,217 --> 00:09:43,750
What the fuck, man?

185
00:09:43,849 --> 00:09:45,692
Stop crying-

186
00:09:45,784 --> 00:09:48,661
So eventually, the games start up again.

187
00:09:50,420 --> 00:09:53,989
Everything's getting back to normal,
everyone's making money again...

188
00:09:54,253 --> 00:09:55,595
and everyone's happy.

189
00:09:59,288 --> 00:10:01,787
One night, they're all sitting around
and they're talking about...

190
00:10:01,886 --> 00:10:03,797
“Remember the time
when all the games were shut down...

191
00:10:03,886 --> 00:10:06,832
and everyone's hearing footsteps
and what a fucking drag?“

192
00:10:06,922 --> 00:10:08,924
Yeah, yeah, that was horrible.

193
00:10:09,191 --> 00:10:11,260
And Markie starts laughing.

194
00:10:12,392 --> 00:10:13,961
He can't help himself.

195
00:10:14,226 --> 00:10:15,998
You know what?

196
00:10:16,258 --> 00:10:19,201
He tells them it was him
that robbed his own game.

197
00:10:19,991 --> 00:10:20,865
I did it!

198
00:10:20,957 --> 00:10:22,766
And everyone thinks it's funny.

199
00:10:22,859 --> 00:10:23,529
Where was I?

200
00:10:23,625 --> 00:10:26,193
What the hell, it really
wasn't their money that was stolen...

201
00:10:26,792 --> 00:10:29,863
and everyone loves Markie,
so they give him a pass.

202
00:10:31,761 --> 00:10:32,864
But if it happens again,

203
00:10:32,961 --> 00:10:35,338
if Markie's game gets knocked over...

204
00:10:35,429 --> 00:10:36,699
they're gonna know it was Markie

205
00:10:36,793 --> 00:10:39,205
and Markie's gonna take the fall for it.

206
00:10:40,230 --> 00:10:42,901
All right, well, fuck it. I'm in.
What about Russell?

207
00:10:42,996 --> 00:10:44,566
I don't give a rat's ass.
You can go in there with...

208
00:10:44,665 --> 00:10:47,801
fucking Tarzan and his fucking
spotted jockstrap for all I care...

209
00:10:47,897 --> 00:10:49,466
if you can get him to do it.

210
00:10:49,831 --> 00:10:51,901
But this thing's gotta move, all right?

211
00:10:51,999 --> 00:10:54,975
All right with me. Look,
I gotta do something soon.

212
00:10:55,231 --> 00:10:56,470
If I don't think of something
soon, I'm gonna have...

213
00:10:56,565 --> 00:10:58,543
to go back and knock
on a gate and say, “Let me back in.

214
00:10:58,631 --> 00:11:00,372
I can't think of nothing
and it's starting to get cold.“

215
00:11:00,466 --> 00:11:01,536
Because just a matter of time...

216
00:11:01,634 --> 00:11:03,475
some other fresh bastards
gonna think of this...

217
00:11:03,568 --> 00:11:05,877
and then ifs gonna be gone,
we don't have the money.

218
00:11:06,569 --> 00:11:08,842
We're not the only smart guys
in the world.

219
00:11:09,335 --> 00:11:11,337
Fuck, this a good car you got.

220
00:11:11,437 --> 00:11:14,503
It's like the lounge room,
mate, but it's a good car.

221
00:11:14,601 --> 00:11:17,478
Yeah, I wish you could
still get a car like this.

222
00:11:17,569 --> 00:11:18,843
Keep this one.

223
00:11:18,937 --> 00:11:21,814
Yeah, that's just
what I need is a nice, hot car.

224
00:11:23,406 --> 00:11:24,612
You're not getting any, are you?

225
00:11:24,707 --> 00:11:27,377
Go fuck yourself. Tomorrow night,
I'm getting some. All right?

226
00:11:27,472 --> 00:11:30,311
You know, if this thing goes all right,
this is my last night a priest.

227
00:11:30,404 --> 00:11:32,213
Fucking take care of my own hog.

228
00:11:32,839 --> 00:11:35,784
You certainly had a bunch of practice
at taking care of your own hog.

229
00:11:35,874 --> 00:11:37,649
Yeah, that's real fucking nice talk.

230
00:11:37,742 --> 00:11:40,412
A guy like you,
sticking it in Goat-Ass' satchel.

231
00:11:40,508 --> 00:11:41,814
Fucking really nice talk.

232
00:11:41,907 --> 00:11:44,443
Hey, we're in jail, you know.

233
00:11:44,542 --> 00:11:48,953
Rule number one,
find yourself a lovely, clean older man.

234
00:11:49,210 --> 00:11:51,777
Who the fuck told you
that Goat-Ass was clean?

235
00:11:51,875 --> 00:11:52,546
Rule number two:

236
00:11:52,642 --> 00:11:55,885
if you can't find that lovely,
clean older man...

237
00:11:55,979 --> 00:11:57,786
take the dirty one.

238
00:11:57,879 --> 00:11:59,256
You're fucking sick.

239
00:11:59,347 --> 00:12:02,585
You know, we should actually
had them get you a goat, you know.

240
00:12:02,679 --> 00:12:05,022
Have 'em bring it into the jail
and you could fuck the goat.

241
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:07,018
You know,
I had some clout with the keepers.

242
00:12:07,580 --> 00:12:08,750
Oh, those poor dogs.

243
00:12:08,845 --> 00:12:10,654
You sure you're not
fucking around with those dogs?

244
00:12:10,747 --> 00:12:14,657
No, no, 'cause they're dogs,
they bite, you know.

245
00:12:14,747 --> 00:12:16,818
I mean, I'll give you some advice, mate.

246
00:12:16,916 --> 00:12:20,258
Don't- not with a dog, you know.

247
00:12:20,350 --> 00:12:22,659
They can nip, from what I hear...

248
00:12:22,751 --> 00:12:25,693
and that's very painful,
from what I hear.

249
00:12:25,783 --> 00:12:27,990
You know, you're better off
with women, mate...

250
00:12:28,252 --> 00:12:30,251
if you can get yourself one, that is.

251
00:12:30,351 --> 00:12:32,853
Well, maybe I'm not sure I can.

252
00:12:32,952 --> 00:12:36,557
They're around.
There's broads just like us, mate.

253
00:12:36,652 --> 00:12:38,892
Just as crazy as us too.

254
00:12:38,987 --> 00:12:42,590
Like this one, she's beautiful,
mate, but she's crazy.

255
00:12:42,687 --> 00:12:44,324
She's crazy.

256
00:12:44,421 --> 00:12:47,298
Let me tell you, all right.
I go up to the house, okay?

257
00:12:47,388 --> 00:12:48,832
I've got a hard-on already.

258
00:12:48,922 --> 00:12:53,231
She opens the door and, fuck, mate,
she was completely naked, you know.

259
00:12:53,324 --> 00:12:56,394
I got quite nervous, mate,
'cause it's been a while, you know.

260
00:12:56,491 --> 00:12:58,901
And she's like, “Well, are you
gonna come and fuck me...

261
00:12:58,992 --> 00:13:00,298
or you gonna stand there all day?“

262
00:13:00,391 --> 00:13:02,560
So I take her in there. I fuck her.

263
00:13:02,656 --> 00:13:04,932
It's really, let me tell you...

264
00:13:05,025 --> 00:13:05,798
she fucked like

265
00:13:05,892 --> 00:13:09,838
a fucking crazy alien
from the planet Gobble, you know?

266
00:13:11,229 --> 00:13:13,933
She started moaning and gobbling, mate.

267
00:13:14,027 --> 00:13:15,768
I mean, really going crazy,

268
00:13:15,862 --> 00:13:17,807
just, like, the cock goes in and

269
00:13:21,229 --> 00:13:25,231
So roll off, done, oh, fantastic.

270
00:13:25,330 --> 00:13:27,604
Next words out of her mouth,

271
00:13:27,697 --> 00:13:29,902
“I'm gonna kill myself.“

272
00:13:30,631 --> 00:13:32,337
They all say that.

273
00:13:32,665 --> 00:13:35,506
That's the first thing they think
of to say, you know, a lot of them.

274
00:13:35,599 --> 00:13:37,543
Yeah, it don't mean anything.

275
00:13:38,765 --> 00:13:40,333
Yeah.

276
00:14:00,570 --> 00:14:01,808
Here you go, man.

277
00:14:03,605 --> 00:14:06,415
Jesus, that's what you fucking got,
dish washing gloves?

278
00:14:08,672 --> 00:14:10,877
Look, you take
what you can fucking get, all right?

279
00:14:10,973 --> 00:14:13,279
These fucking things are too thick.

280
00:14:13,371 --> 00:14:14,941
It's what they had.

281
00:14:15,039 --> 00:14:17,019
They might
had some fucking latex gloves...

282
00:14:17,275 --> 00:14:19,446
from, like,
a fucking hospital or something.

283
00:14:20,275 --> 00:14:21,684
You'll make do.

284
00:14:25,009 --> 00:14:26,043
There you go.

285
00:14:26,309 --> 00:14:28,685
Jesus, the fuck is this?

286
00:14:29,444 --> 00:14:30,479
What does it look like?

287
00:14:30,578 --> 00:14:32,951
It's a fucking sawn-off shotgun, okay?

288
00:14:33,042 --> 00:14:34,747
It's what you asked me
to fucking get you.

289
00:14:34,842 --> 00:14:36,446
I mean, you asked me for this, mate.

290
00:14:36,544 --> 00:14:37,989
We shoot somebody
with this fucking thing...

291
00:14:38,246 --> 00:14:40,246
it's gonna kill everybody
in the fucking room.

292
00:14:40,346 --> 00:14:42,019
Well, tell them that.

293
00:14:43,448 --> 00:14:45,685
We're gonna look like a bunch of
fucking amateurs when we go in there.

294
00:14:45,779 --> 00:14:46,984
Take a breath.

295
00:14:47,247 --> 00:14:49,316
All right, you ready to do this?

296
00:14:52,281 --> 00:14:53,657
You don't even have your glove on.

297
00:14:53,748 --> 00:14:54,488
I got my fucking glove on.

298
00:14:54,582 --> 00:14:56,581
Just shut the fuck up.

299
00:14:56,681 --> 00:14:57,784
You shut the fuck up.

300
00:14:57,881 --> 00:14:59,861
You know, I'm going out there
with a fucking hand grenade...

301
00:14:59,950 --> 00:15:01,984
and there's a fucking condom on my hand.

302
00:16:03,463 --> 00:16:05,963
All right, hands, hands,
hands, all of you, hands!

303
00:16:06,062 --> 00:16:07,870
Get your fucking hands up.

304
00:16:17,632 --> 00:16:18,610
Okay.

305
00:16:45,604 --> 00:16:47,743
I hope you guys know what you're doing.

306
00:16:59,507 --> 00:17:00,850
Should I get the money?

307
00:17:08,743 --> 00:17:10,721
Just take it easy.

308
00:17:24,382 --> 00:17:26,086
Hands, hands!

309
00:17:44,884 --> 00:17:46,794
You stop fucking looking at me.

310
00:17:57,053 --> 00:18:00,623
Stop fucking looking at me.
Get your fucking hands up.

311
00:18:03,087 --> 00:18:05,031
You know they're gonna kill you.

312
00:18:07,657 --> 00:18:09,531
You know that, don't you?

313
00:18:13,523 --> 00:18:15,557
That doesn't have to happen.

314
00:18:16,390 --> 00:18:18,495
It shouldn't happen to you.

315
00:18:22,324 --> 00:18:24,462
You should just put the gun down...

316
00:18:25,756 --> 00:18:29,498
turn around and walk out the front door.

317
00:18:30,059 --> 00:18:32,037
I'll take care of your friend.

318
00:18:33,694 --> 00:18:36,763
I ain't gonna fucking tell you again,
you stop fucking looking at me.

319
00:18:36,860 --> 00:18:38,703
Don't worry about him.

320
00:18:38,795 --> 00:18:40,830
I'll take care of him for you.

321
00:18:40,928 --> 00:18:42,803
What's going on in there?

322
00:18:44,328 --> 00:18:45,636
Come on, now.

323
00:18:46,597 --> 00:18:48,369
Hands, hands, hands!

324
00:18:49,496 --> 00:18:51,600
Get your fucking hands up!

325
00:18:57,933 --> 00:18:59,375
What's going on in there?

326
00:19:01,898 --> 00:19:03,898
Talk to me! What's going on in there?

327
00:19:09,668 --> 00:19:11,613
You sure you want to do this?

328
00:19:19,405 --> 00:19:21,347
All right, put it on the table.

329
00:19:29,473 --> 00:19:31,312
You want me to sit down?

330
00:19:49,342 --> 00:19:50,548
Nice.

331
00:19:52,078 --> 00:19:53,953
All right, you motherfucker,
give it up right now!

332
00:19:54,045 --> 00:19:56,045
You got the money. Leave him alone.

333
00:19:56,310 --> 00:19:57,843
Hey, take out what you got in
your pockets and put it on the table.

334
00:19:57,941 --> 00:19:59,784
Hey, leave the poor bastard alone!

335
00:19:59,877 --> 00:20:01,083
You got all the money.

336
00:20:01,345 --> 00:20:02,653
Hey, shut the fuck up!

337
00:20:02,746 --> 00:20:05,520
Leave the fucking bastard--
-You shut the fuck up!

338
00:20:14,313 --> 00:20:15,792
All right, you fucking cocksucker...

339
00:20:15,881 --> 00:20:18,952
get your fucking money out of
your pockets and put it on the table...

340
00:20:19,050 --> 00:20:21,686
nice and fucking slow.

341
00:20:21,782 --> 00:20:24,092
All right, you fucking prick.

342
00:20:24,848 --> 00:20:27,522
All right, now you.
Put it on the fucking table...

343
00:20:27,618 --> 00:20:31,358
nice and fucking slow. Stop fucking
looking at me. Hey, get your hands up!

344
00:20:31,452 --> 00:20:33,656
Not you yet. Get your fucking hands up!

345
00:20:33,751 --> 00:20:35,922
Get your fucking hands
out of your pocket!

346
00:20:37,852 --> 00:20:39,797
All right, now,
there's two ways we can do this.

347
00:20:39,887 --> 00:20:41,762
There's the easy way and the hard way.

348
00:20:41,853 --> 00:20:44,387
All right, the easy way is to do what
these two guys are doing.

349
00:20:44,486 --> 00:20:46,395
All right, the hard way is to
make us come around and all...

350
00:20:46,486 --> 00:20:48,329
which is gonna make him nervous.
Now, you can sit there...

351
00:20:48,422 --> 00:20:49,867
and act like you haven't
got it in your sock

352
00:20:49,955 --> 00:20:50,897
or something, but then after...

353
00:20:50,988 --> 00:20:53,626
me and my nervous friend
are gonna come around and make sure.

354
00:20:53,722 --> 00:20:55,065
And for all the guys
that didn't remember everything...

355
00:20:55,323 --> 00:20:57,927
we're gonna knock every
last one of their fucking teeth out.

356
00:20:59,925 --> 00:21:01,630
How's that?

357
00:21:06,427 --> 00:21:08,992
Good. That's the way I feel too.

358
00:21:09,090 --> 00:21:12,832
All right, the less guys that get hurt,
the better, so don't fuck around.

359
00:21:13,958 --> 00:21:16,996
Just keep quiet and give it
all up and nobody gets hurt.

360
00:21:17,629 --> 00:21:18,626
It's only money.

361
00:21:18,726 --> 00:21:19,704
Good evening.

362
00:21:19,794 --> 00:21:23,400
This is an extraordinary period
for America's economy.

363
00:21:23,496 --> 00:21:25,531
Over the past few weeks,
many Americans have

364
00:21:25,630 --> 00:21:29,075
felt anxiety about
their finances and their future.

365
00:21:29,330 --> 00:21:32,138
I understand their worry
and their frustration.

366
00:21:32,397 --> 00:21:34,930
We've seen triple-digit swings
in the stock market.

367
00:21:35,029 --> 00:21:37,099
All right, do it.
-Major financial institutions

368
00:21:37,364 --> 00:21:39,105
have teetered on the edge of collapse...

369
00:21:39,366 --> 00:21:40,866
and some failed.

370
00:21:41,498 --> 00:21:42,636
As uncertainty has grown,

371
00:21:42,733 --> 00:21:45,006
many banks have restricted lending...

372
00:21:45,099 --> 00:21:47,008
credit markets have frozen...

373
00:21:47,099 --> 00:21:50,943
and families and businesses
have found it harder to borrow money.

374
00:21:51,034 --> 00:21:54,639
We're in the midst
of a serious financial crisis...

375
00:21:54,736 --> 00:21:58,406
and the federal government
is responding with decisive action.

376
00:21:58,501 --> 00:22:01,912
We boosted confidence
in money market mutual funds.

377
00:22:21,674 --> 00:22:24,412
I know many Americans
have questions tonight.

378
00:22:24,506 --> 00:22:27,043
How did we reach
this point in our economy?

379
00:22:27,142 --> 00:22:29,641
How will the solution I propose work?

380
00:22:29,741 --> 00:22:32,947
And what does this mean
for your financial future?

381
00:22:33,944 --> 00:22:38,014
These are good questions
and they deserve good answers.

382
00:22:38,112 --> 00:22:40,644
First-(indecipherable).

383
00:23:03,115 --> 00:23:04,890
Go, go. Go, go, go-

384
00:24:29,165 --> 00:24:32,078
They told me when they heard that
if Dillon wasn't available...

385
00:24:32,168 --> 00:24:35,476
that I was supposed to talk
to the fella he sent. Is that you?

386
00:24:36,001 --> 00:24:39,137
I don't see nobody else
who might be here to meet you. Do you?

387
00:24:44,170 --> 00:24:45,806
Let's get out from
under these construction guys.

388
00:24:45,903 --> 00:24:48,108
Bang a right and go a couple blocks.
-Most of the Republicans we know

389
00:24:48,371 --> 00:24:50,815
doesn't like this bill
and President Bush,

390
00:24:50,904 --> 00:24:55,007
I mean he's in the position now
of trying to sway public opinion...

391
00:24:55,105 --> 00:24:56,880
and build support for it.

392
00:24:56,973 --> 00:25:00,109
With the situation becoming
more precarious by the day...

393
00:25:00,373 --> 00:25:02,046
I face the choice to

394
00:25:02,141 --> 00:25:05,051
step in with dramatic
government action...

395
00:25:05,139 --> 00:25:05,981
or to stand back

396
00:25:06,073 --> 00:25:08,713
and allow
the irresponsible actions of some...

397
00:25:08,809 --> 00:25:12,183
to undermine
the financial security of all.

398
00:25:12,441 --> 00:25:14,478
There has been
a widespread loss of confidence.

399
00:25:14,577 --> 00:25:15,146
Left.

400
00:25:15,411 --> 00:25:18,412
And major sectors
of Americas financial system are

401
00:25:18,511 --> 00:25:20,512
at risk of shutting down.

402
00:25:20,946 --> 00:25:23,012
The government's top
economic experts warn that...

403
00:25:23,110 --> 00:25:25,488
without immediate action by Congress...

404
00:25:25,579 --> 00:25:27,557
America could slip into
a financial panic. -So,

405
00:25:27,645 --> 00:25:29,488
they were very concerned
when I told them...

406
00:25:29,581 --> 00:25:31,081
I called Dillon, Dillon said to see you.

407
00:25:31,180 --> 00:25:32,520
They're very concerned.

408
00:25:32,612 --> 00:25:34,113
How is the fella?

409
00:25:34,380 --> 00:25:36,451
Not good. Saw him yesterday.

410
00:25:36,548 --> 00:25:38,685
He said he feels like somebody
stuck a knife in his chest.

411
00:25:38,782 --> 00:25:41,419
So he probably won't be able to
handle anything for a while.

412
00:25:41,515 --> 00:25:43,185
He sure can't right now.

413
00:25:44,382 --> 00:25:46,725
Personally,
I think the guy's in very bad shape.

414
00:25:47,549 --> 00:25:49,458
Go under the bridge and you can park.

415
00:25:59,150 --> 00:26:03,723
So, Mark Trattman's game
was hit a couple of nights ago.

416
00:26:05,086 --> 00:26:06,063
I heard that.

417
00:26:06,152 --> 00:26:07,995
Yeah, two kids.

418
00:26:08,087 --> 00:26:08,996
Yeah?

419
00:26:09,087 --> 00:26:11,565
You or Dillon hear anything
about two kids?

420
00:26:11,654 --> 00:26:14,497
We hear lots of things. I heard
they had masks on, for one thing.

421
00:26:14,590 --> 00:26:15,498
Correct.

422
00:26:15,587 --> 00:26:17,658
So maybe they're not kids.

423
00:26:17,756 --> 00:26:20,531
Well, they were dressed like kids,
dungarees.

424
00:26:20,624 --> 00:26:23,159
Smelled like animals, Trattman said.

425
00:26:23,425 --> 00:26:25,164
Trattman said.

426
00:26:26,123 --> 00:26:30,833
Well, Trattman also said that the one
who talked had a voice like a kid's.

427
00:26:30,926 --> 00:26:32,766
Trattman said.

428
00:26:34,725 --> 00:26:36,101
Well, as far as I know...

429
00:26:36,192 --> 00:26:39,763
there's nothing wrong with Trattman's
hearing or his nose or anything.

430
00:26:41,028 --> 00:26:44,028
No, nothing I've heard about, anyways.

431
00:26:49,163 --> 00:26:52,607
So where do we go from here?
What do you think?

432
00:26:54,562 --> 00:26:56,063
It could have been Trattman.

433
00:26:56,163 --> 00:26:57,641
He coulda decided to do it again.

434
00:26:57,730 --> 00:27:00,606
No one'd ever think
he's dumb enough to do it twice.

435
00:27:00,697 --> 00:27:03,769
But I know Markie. He's not that dumb.

436
00:27:03,865 --> 00:27:07,141
So I figured some other smart guys
knew he did it before.

437
00:27:07,401 --> 00:27:08,936
For now, it don't matter.

438
00:27:09,034 --> 00:27:10,509
It doesn't?

439
00:27:10,599 --> 00:27:13,443
We start with Trattman.
We start real good too.

440
00:27:13,535 --> 00:27:16,070
Wait a minute.
-I'll wait a week if you want.

441
00:27:16,169 --> 00:27:19,612
No, I don't understand.
I thought you believed him.

442
00:27:19,702 --> 00:27:20,939
My friend, I do,

443
00:27:21,033 --> 00:27:22,979
but the games are closed, right?

444
00:27:23,803 --> 00:27:25,043
Grant's Tomb.

445
00:27:25,138 --> 00:27:26,706
People are losing money.

446
00:27:26,804 --> 00:27:27,714
A fair inference.

447
00:27:27,803 --> 00:27:29,747
They don't like to lose money.

448
00:27:29,836 --> 00:27:31,871
We hit Trattman,
get things started up again...

449
00:27:31,970 --> 00:27:34,507
get people back to doing
what they're supposed to be doing.

450
00:27:34,606 --> 00:27:37,049
They want to find out
if he did it first.

451
00:27:37,539 --> 00:27:40,019
It don't make a bit of difference
if Trattman did it...

452
00:27:40,108 --> 00:27:41,845
or someone did it to Trattman.

453
00:27:41,939 --> 00:27:43,213
If people think he did it

454
00:27:43,474 --> 00:27:44,817
and he's still walking around...

455
00:27:44,909 --> 00:27:48,077
you're gonna have kids waiting in line,
knock them fucking games over.

456
00:27:49,141 --> 00:27:52,121
They just want you to talk to him.

457
00:27:52,774 --> 00:27:54,480
Talk to him?

458
00:27:55,809 --> 00:27:57,720
What does that mean?

459
00:27:58,143 --> 00:28:00,953
Talk to Trattman, see what he says.

460
00:28:01,613 --> 00:28:02,750
Talk to him?

461
00:28:02,846 --> 00:28:05,117
Really talk to him.

462
00:28:08,414 --> 00:28:10,084
A beating?

463
00:28:14,712 --> 00:28:16,520
How badly they want him beaten?

464
00:28:16,613 --> 00:28:18,058
Shove him around a little...

465
00:28:18,148 --> 00:28:20,524
you know, but don't hurt him too badly
'cause they don't want him hurt.

466
00:28:20,615 --> 00:28:23,457
Oh, of course you do.
You guys, you always do that.

467
00:28:23,549 --> 00:28:23,992
All right.

468
00:28:24,082 --> 00:28:24,956
Quit shitting me, all right?

469
00:28:25,047 --> 00:28:26,583
All right.
-Stop the bullshit.

470
00:28:26,682 --> 00:28:27,989
All right, it's stopped.

471
00:28:28,083 --> 00:28:29,584
But why?

472
00:28:29,683 --> 00:28:31,126
What's he gonna do,
fold under questioning?

473
00:28:31,216 --> 00:28:32,923
If he does, they'll kill him.

474
00:28:33,018 --> 00:28:33,621
If he doesn't,

475
00:28:33,719 --> 00:28:36,093
they'll figure he's lying like
last time and they'll kill him.

476
00:28:36,184 --> 00:28:38,221
Either way, Markie's dead.

477
00:28:38,586 --> 00:28:40,789
So why put the poor bastard
through a beating?

478
00:28:40,885 --> 00:28:42,089
It's a waste of time...

479
00:28:42,184 --> 00:28:45,222
not to mention a really
unpleasant experience for Markie.

480
00:28:45,486 --> 00:28:48,157
Just put him out of his misery,
poor bastard.

481
00:28:48,420 --> 00:28:50,161
What's the problem?

482
00:28:50,821 --> 00:28:53,766
It's murder and they are squeamish.

483
00:28:53,855 --> 00:28:56,835
Oh, for fuck's sake.
Who's running things?

484
00:28:56,924 --> 00:28:59,560
You have no idea.

485
00:29:00,623 --> 00:29:02,691
No decision-makers.

486
00:29:03,222 --> 00:29:05,758
I got to take them by the hand
and I got to walk them...

487
00:29:05,857 --> 00:29:08,834
slowly through it like
they're retarded children.

488
00:29:08,923 --> 00:29:10,129
What is it, a committee?

489
00:29:10,224 --> 00:29:12,135
Total corporate mentality.

490
00:29:14,192 --> 00:29:16,069
Christ's sake.

491
00:29:16,826 --> 00:29:19,565
This country is fucked, I'm telling you.

492
00:29:19,926 --> 00:29:21,769
There's a plague coming.

493
00:29:26,094 --> 00:29:29,131
Today we are taking decisive actions...

494
00:29:29,229 --> 00:29:31,798
to protect the US economy.

495
00:29:32,130 --> 00:29:34,969
We regret having to take these actions.

496
00:29:35,061 --> 00:29:38,974
Today's actions are not
what we ever wanted to do...

497
00:29:39,064 --> 00:29:41,802
but today's actions
are what we must do...

498
00:29:41,897 --> 00:29:45,208
to restore confidence
in our financial system.

499
00:29:46,499 --> 00:29:48,671
Today I'm announcing...

500
00:29:48,767 --> 00:29:51,801
that the treasury
will purchase equity stakes.

501
00:29:55,034 --> 00:29:57,205
It's this gray
one right here on the left.

502
00:29:57,868 --> 00:29:59,244
That's where he lives?

503
00:29:59,502 --> 00:30:00,808
Yep.

504
00:30:05,837 --> 00:30:07,815
Jackie, that prick.

505
00:30:07,904 --> 00:30:08,939
Jackie's all right.

506
00:30:09,038 --> 00:30:11,539
He's a mean little prick.

507
00:30:11,937 --> 00:30:15,711
But we gotta deal with
Markie's fucking feelings, not him.

508
00:30:15,805 --> 00:30:17,875
Markie's gonna be okay.

509
00:30:18,671 --> 00:30:20,480
He's gonna make it hard on us.

510
00:30:20,573 --> 00:30:22,075
No, he's not.

511
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:26,842
Yeah, he will. Fuck.

512
00:30:28,541 --> 00:30:30,541
He insists it has to be done..

513
00:30:30,641 --> 00:30:31,881
Without meaningful discussion

514
00:30:31,975 --> 00:30:33,817
or debate or any change...

515
00:30:33,910 --> 00:30:35,544
sort of, you know...

516
00:30:35,641 --> 00:30:39,144
a immediate authorization
for use of financial force.

517
00:30:39,243 --> 00:30:43,553
That is Mr. Paulson's plan,
former head of Goldman Sachs.

518
00:30:43,646 --> 00:30:48,111
We should not be rolled
by our Wall Street exec...

519
00:30:48,211 --> 00:30:52,157
who's masquerading
as Secretary of the Treasury.

520
00:30:52,246 --> 00:30:53,986
Does this remind
anybody of anything...

521
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:58,524
like the rush into Iraq
on election eve a number of years ago?

522
00:30:58,613 --> 00:31:00,456
It's all too familiar.

523
00:31:21,054 --> 00:31:24,120
There need to be consequences
and there needs to be major change--

524
00:31:24,218 --> 00:31:25,959
Hey.
-Get in the car, Markie.

525
00:31:27,821 --> 00:31:28,818
For what?

526
00:31:28,918 --> 00:31:32,456
For what?
Get in the fucking car, Markie.

527
00:31:32,555 --> 00:31:34,691
Steve, I didn't do nothing.

528
00:31:34,787 --> 00:31:35,925
You're gonna get in the car.

529
00:31:36,022 --> 00:31:39,831
You know you're gonna get in
the car, so get in the fucking car!

530
00:31:42,757 --> 00:31:43,667
Barry, open the fucking door.

531
00:31:43,758 --> 00:31:44,733
Shoot me.

532
00:31:44,823 --> 00:31:46,597
I'll fucking shoot you.
-Go on, shoot me.

533
00:31:46,690 --> 00:31:48,635
Fuck you, Markie.
-Get in the fucking car now!

534
00:31:48,724 --> 00:31:50,496
Get in the fucking car, motherfucker!
-Get in the fucking car!

535
00:31:50,590 --> 00:31:51,660
You fuck.

536
00:31:52,625 --> 00:31:54,501
Get out of the car, Markie.

537
00:31:54,593 --> 00:31:57,196
Please, Steve,
let me talk this over, okay?

538
00:31:57,460 --> 00:31:59,699
Get out of the car now, Markie.

539
00:31:59,793 --> 00:32:01,201
I didn't do nothing.

540
00:32:01,459 --> 00:32:02,836
I told you, didn't I?

541
00:32:02,927 --> 00:32:04,997
I told you he was
gonna make it hard on us.

542
00:32:05,094 --> 00:32:06,537
Why you gotta do this, Markie?

543
00:32:06,627 --> 00:32:07,696
I mean,
this is hard for us too, you know.

544
00:32:07,794 --> 00:32:08,864
Why you gotta make it hard for us?

545
00:32:08,962 --> 00:32:10,804
Cause I didn't do nothing.

546
00:32:10,896 --> 00:32:11,964
Move, Markie.

547
00:32:12,062 --> 00:32:14,770
Fucking little prick,
just get the fuck out of the car.

548
00:32:14,864 --> 00:32:16,965
Get the fuck out. Come on!
-Get out of the car, Markie.

549
00:32:17,062 --> 00:32:19,563
He's not speaking fucking Chinese.

550
00:32:20,597 --> 00:32:23,039
Come on, Trattman. Let's go.

551
00:32:27,765 --> 00:32:29,073
Close the fucking door.

552
00:32:30,733 --> 00:32:32,268
Okay, move over here.

553
00:32:32,534 --> 00:32:34,534
Move down there, down there.

554
00:32:34,634 --> 00:32:36,009
By the door.

555
00:32:36,701 --> 00:32:39,270
Jesus fucking Christ.

556
00:32:40,735 --> 00:32:43,473
May my mother get cancer...

557
00:32:43,568 --> 00:32:45,807
I had nothing to do with this.

558
00:32:46,869 --> 00:32:48,746
You can't tell them that?

559
00:32:49,970 --> 00:32:52,610
I know how it looks. I know.

560
00:32:52,706 --> 00:32:56,170
Honest to God, I didn't.

561
00:32:59,039 --> 00:33:01,176
Fuck, Barry.

562
00:33:28,613 --> 00:33:30,487
He's got fucking blood all over me.

563
00:33:44,582 --> 00:33:46,118
Who are the kids, Markie?

564
00:33:46,217 --> 00:33:49,091
I don't know. I don't know.

565
00:33:49,181 --> 00:33:51,559
No, I don't know.

566
00:33:52,649 --> 00:33:54,490
You're making this hard for us, buddy.

567
00:33:54,916 --> 00:33:57,521
Come on, baby. Okay.

568
00:33:57,618 --> 00:33:59,561
No, no, no.
-Hold your hands.

569
00:33:59,650 --> 00:34:01,288
Markie, I don't want to hit your hands.

570
00:34:01,552 --> 00:34:02,155
Just fucking hit him!

571
00:34:02,253 --> 00:34:03,491
Turn him around.
-Fucking hit him!

572
00:34:03,586 --> 00:34:04,824
Right there.

573
00:34:06,885 --> 00:34:08,489
Get his hands, Steven.

574
00:34:08,587 --> 00:34:10,256
No, no.

575
00:34:20,225 --> 00:34:22,827
Hey, man. You okay, Markie?

576
00:34:22,923 --> 00:34:25,231
Hey, Markie, you all right?

577
00:34:25,824 --> 00:34:27,801
Okay, let's give him a try now.

578
00:34:32,790 --> 00:34:33,734
Markie, about the kids,

579
00:34:33,824 --> 00:34:35,826
are you sure you don't know
who those kids are?

580
00:34:40,528 --> 00:34:41,698
You really sure?

581
00:34:41,827 --> 00:34:43,599
I'm sure.

582
00:34:43,693 --> 00:34:44,933
I'm sure, Steve.

583
00:34:45,027 --> 00:34:46,505
Cause I gotta be.

584
00:34:46,594 --> 00:34:47,299
I gotta be sure, Markie,

585
00:34:47,561 --> 00:34:49,800
and you make me stay out here
all night making sure,

586
00:34:49,894 --> 00:34:51,635
I'm not gonna like it.

587
00:34:52,230 --> 00:34:54,764
It's gonna be an awful
long night for you, Mark.

588
00:34:55,964 --> 00:34:57,601
You bastard.

589
00:34:58,765 --> 00:35:00,172
You cocksucker!

590
00:35:04,996 --> 00:35:05,940
What do you say, Steve?

591
00:35:06,030 --> 00:35:07,031
SHUT UP!

592
00:35:07,131 --> 00:35:08,974
Let's get the fuck out of here.

593
00:35:09,067 --> 00:35:10,601
Fuck.

594
00:35:12,601 --> 00:35:13,544
Steven.

595
00:35:13,634 --> 00:35:14,543
What?!

596
00:35:14,634 --> 00:35:16,043
Get in the car.

597
00:35:59,774 --> 00:36:02,754
You fucking dirty fucking dog.

598
00:36:06,044 --> 00:36:07,250
Hey, asshole.

599
00:36:07,513 --> 00:36:10,548
Look at you! Look at you!

600
00:36:10,646 --> 00:36:11,146
How are you?

601
00:36:11,246 --> 00:36:13,884
Oh, you look fucking ridiculous.

602
00:36:13,980 --> 00:36:15,719
Look at your fucking hair.
-Go fuck yourself.

603
00:36:15,812 --> 00:36:17,654
What are you talking about?
-What spray shit did you put in it?

604
00:36:17,746 --> 00:36:19,950
It ain't spray. I'm not fucking queer.

605
00:36:20,045 --> 00:36:21,854
There's gel on it, you fucking prick.

606
00:36:21,947 --> 00:36:22,754
You sure you're not
-Yeah, the guy

607
00:36:22,847 --> 00:36:24,326
a little bit of a queer?
-that out it gave me the stuff.

608
00:36:24,582 --> 00:36:26,718
Oh, look at this. New car.

609
00:36:26,815 --> 00:36:28,021
Oh, what the fuck is that?

610
00:36:28,116 --> 00:36:30,024
It's dog shit. Come on, let's go.

611
00:36:30,115 --> 00:36:32,115
Let's go, come on. I've got to get home.

612
00:36:32,215 --> 00:36:35,160
Russell, you fucking smell like shit.
You're not getting in my car like that.

613
00:36:35,250 --> 00:36:38,127
You smell like shit too, like gay shit.

614
00:36:38,217 --> 00:36:41,095
Look at this.
Everything's going good. Shut up.

615
00:37:26,927 --> 00:37:28,564
It was beautiful.

616
00:37:29,295 --> 00:37:33,138
Yeah, we leave in the middle
of the night, for fuck's sake.

617
00:37:33,630 --> 00:37:35,131
All the way to Florida,

618
00:37:35,230 --> 00:37:38,299
we're in this fucking rainstorm.

619
00:37:38,564 --> 00:37:42,837
The dogs are all pissing
and farting and shitting...

620
00:37:43,997 --> 00:37:47,065
and we can't roll the windows down.
We don't want to drown.

621
00:37:47,162 --> 00:37:50,075
Put the fucking window--
what are you, an asshole?!

622
00:37:50,165 --> 00:37:51,301
Put the fucking cigarette out!

623
00:37:53,100 --> 00:37:56,545
It was awful.
It was like riding in a shit house.

624
00:37:56,933 --> 00:38:00,936
And then after got over to Orlando,
we're gonna burn the car...

625
00:38:01,035 --> 00:38:05,035
so Kenny sticks a rag
in the gas tank, and he lights it off.

626
00:38:05,134 --> 00:38:07,974
You're gonna need to get a stick.
Don't do it by hand, mate.

627
00:38:08,066 --> 00:38:10,239
Don't be a such--
Russell, you're a fucking pussy.

628
00:38:10,335 --> 00:38:12,246
I've clone it a million fucking times.

629
00:38:14,104 --> 00:38:17,142
It's fine. It goes up like
a fucking bonfire. I love it.

630
00:38:19,837 --> 00:38:21,111
See?

631
00:38:32,173 --> 00:38:33,208
Fuck!

632
00:38:36,142 --> 00:38:39,711
Kenny, he didn't
have no eyebrows left...

633
00:38:39,808 --> 00:38:41,581
not much hair...

634
00:38:42,008 --> 00:38:44,545
and no sense of humor either.

635
00:38:44,877 --> 00:38:48,584
You know, I thought dogs was gonna
be an easy way to make money.

636
00:38:48,679 --> 00:38:50,215
I was half right.

637
00:38:50,780 --> 00:38:52,780
You look all beat to shit.

638
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:54,051
Yeah.

639
00:38:54,147 --> 00:38:58,555
And the thing of it is,
I've been up for a week, all right...

640
00:38:58,645 --> 00:39:02,021
and I got to keep going
until I finish this thing off.

641
00:39:02,112 --> 00:39:03,682
What, you haven't dumped the stuff?

642
00:39:03,780 --> 00:39:07,589
Dumped it? Christ, no.
I haven't stepped it yet.

643
00:39:07,681 --> 00:39:09,922
Look, I put it to a guy fast,

644
00:39:10,017 --> 00:39:12,856
I'm gonna no more than 15 or 16.

645
00:39:12,948 --> 00:39:15,621
I take it up a step...

646
00:39:15,716 --> 00:39:19,854
I can move it to two guys for 25.

647
00:39:19,950 --> 00:39:23,018
Russell, ifs stupid.
it's fucking stupid.

648
00:39:24,018 --> 00:39:27,055
That's a thousand dollars a year.

649
00:39:28,220 --> 00:39:30,958
Oh, you're as dumb as I am.

650
00:39:31,052 --> 00:39:34,188
Maybe you think we were
smart doing that other thing...

651
00:39:34,285 --> 00:39:35,958
but we were dumb.

652
00:39:37,154 --> 00:39:39,361
That worked out beautiful.

653
00:39:39,621 --> 00:39:44,329
Oh, sure, fucking cheesecake.

654
00:39:44,590 --> 00:39:48,864
Course, we got a contract out on us.

655
00:39:48,957 --> 00:39:52,331
But, yeah, beautiful.

656
00:40:03,627 --> 00:40:05,800
What the fuck are you talking about?

657
00:40:13,094 --> 00:40:14,970
The fuck you talking about?

658
00:40:16,163 --> 00:40:17,764
Russell?

659
00:40:18,728 --> 00:40:20,230
Russell?

660
00:40:20,330 --> 00:40:21,741
Hey.

661
00:40:22,730 --> 00:40:24,833
What the fuck are you talking about?

662
00:40:27,665 --> 00:40:31,735
There's a contract on us,
you, me and the Squirrel.

663
00:40:31,832 --> 00:40:35,242
I'm gonna be as dead
as you guys if I hang around here.

664
00:40:35,333 --> 00:40:37,279
I'm going to Montreal.

665
00:40:38,832 --> 00:40:40,311
For what?

666
00:40:42,636 --> 00:40:45,134
Hey. For what?

667
00:40:47,168 --> 00:40:48,772
For what?

668
00:40:48,870 --> 00:40:50,846
Cut the shit, for the Trattman game.

669
00:40:50,935 --> 00:40:52,676
What the fuck's the matter with you?

670
00:40:52,770 --> 00:40:55,078
Russell, Trattman's practically dead.

671
00:40:55,170 --> 00:40:56,979
They beat him shitless.

672
00:40:57,272 --> 00:40:59,182
You didn't know that, did you?

673
00:41:00,140 --> 00:41:03,081
Course I did. Kenny told me.

674
00:41:05,339 --> 00:41:07,112
Kenny?

675
00:41:10,175 --> 00:41:12,673
Is this Kenny Gill we're talking about?

676
00:41:15,342 --> 00:41:19,218
Hey, Russell, is this Kenny Gill
we're talking about?

677
00:41:22,308 --> 00:41:24,183
Russell, wake up!

678
00:41:25,776 --> 00:41:26,720
What'd you say?

679
00:41:26,810 --> 00:41:29,687
Is this Kenny Gill we're talking about?

680
00:41:29,778 --> 00:41:31,348
Yeah.

681
00:41:31,613 --> 00:41:34,056
Russell, Kenny Gill works for Dillon.

682
00:41:36,113 --> 00:41:38,646
Kenny Gill works for Dillon!

683
00:41:39,644 --> 00:41:40,384
So?

684
00:41:40,645 --> 00:41:42,318
So you go talking to
a fucking guy that works--

685
00:41:42,581 --> 00:41:46,390
Fucking guy that works
for fucking Dillon.

686
00:41:47,049 --> 00:41:49,787
So fucking what?

687
00:41:50,381 --> 00:41:52,588
What else did you tell him?

688
00:41:52,684 --> 00:41:53,594
What did you tell him,

689
00:41:53,685 --> 00:41:56,718
in case Kenny didn't get
the whole fucking story before?

690
00:41:57,649 --> 00:42:00,126
I didn't say shit.

691
00:42:33,989 --> 00:42:35,935
Now, aside from Squirrel...

692
00:42:36,024 --> 00:42:38,296
we got the kids, two kids.

693
00:42:38,389 --> 00:42:40,062
One of them is the motor mouth.

694
00:42:40,158 --> 00:42:41,967
Drove to Florida with Kenny...

695
00:42:42,060 --> 00:42:43,935
Kenny Gill, our Kenny,

696
00:42:44,026 --> 00:42:45,595
guy he knows works for Dillon...

697
00:42:45,694 --> 00:42:47,605
and starts bragging about
how he's a big-time operator

698
00:42:47,696 --> 00:42:49,830
just knocked over
this guy's game for 100K.

699
00:42:49,926 --> 00:42:50,733
You serious?

700
00:42:50,826 --> 00:42:52,066
I don't know what it is with these guys.

701
00:42:52,161 --> 00:42:54,400
They can't keep
their mouth shut about nothing.

702
00:42:54,661 --> 00:42:57,800
And Kenny, Kenny's just as dumb.

703
00:42:58,397 --> 00:43:00,202
The way I found out was...

704
00:43:00,295 --> 00:43:02,672
this guy's invested his money
in a couple ounces of smack...

705
00:43:02,763 --> 00:43:03,798
wants Kenny to come in with him.

706
00:43:03,898 --> 00:43:06,342
Kenny comes to me and wants
know what I think about that.

707
00:43:06,966 --> 00:43:08,839
I guess these guys,
they just want to go to jail...

708
00:43:08,930 --> 00:43:10,770
probably feel at home there.

709
00:43:10,862 --> 00:43:14,105
So you want to move now
or you want to wait, what?

710
00:43:14,967 --> 00:43:17,275
I talked to Dillon. We both think now.

711
00:43:17,367 --> 00:43:18,175
Okay.

712
00:43:18,268 --> 00:43:19,804
Whack Trattman,
get the games started up.

713
00:43:19,903 --> 00:43:21,901
Trattman,
what brings Trattman into this?

714
00:43:22,001 --> 00:43:25,380
You just told me that it was...

715
00:43:25,636 --> 00:43:27,201
this Squirrel fella and his two friends.

716
00:43:27,299 --> 00:43:30,940
It is, plus I had Trattman
talked to, I'm sure. -Yeah.

717
00:43:31,036 --> 00:43:33,034
You ought to be. Your boys
went a little overboard there.

718
00:43:33,134 --> 00:43:34,204
They damn near killed the man.

719
00:43:34,302 --> 00:43:35,280
It wasn't my idea.

720
00:43:35,370 --> 00:43:37,177
Waste of time, I said.
Waste of money, I said.

721
00:43:37,270 --> 00:43:38,715
Why put Markie through it, I said.

722
00:43:38,805 --> 00:43:40,375
You know, he called me up.

723
00:43:40,640 --> 00:43:42,947
I had trouble understanding him.
Hell, I had trouble calling him back...

724
00:43:43,039 --> 00:43:44,878
cause he got
my secretary the first time.

725
00:43:44,971 --> 00:43:47,679
She couldn't understand him,
the numbers he left.

726
00:43:47,771 --> 00:43:49,216
He's got a broken jaw.

727
00:43:49,306 --> 00:43:50,944
I heard that.
-Got broken ribs...

728
00:43:51,041 --> 00:43:53,244
he got a broken nose,
three or four broken teeth.

729
00:43:53,340 --> 00:43:56,751
There's some question about
his spleen, he said.

730
00:43:57,275 --> 00:43:59,150
He was in the hospital
when I talked to him.

731
00:43:59,642 --> 00:44:00,950
He's out now, I understand.

732
00:44:01,043 --> 00:44:02,644
Must be his spleen's okay then.

733
00:44:02,742 --> 00:44:04,116
You know, he's not happy, though.

734
00:44:04,207 --> 00:44:06,846
I'm sorry to hear that.
We aim to please.

735
00:44:07,610 --> 00:44:08,748
That's what I'm supposed to tell them?

736
00:44:08,844 --> 00:44:11,118
Tell them whatever you want.
Won't make a bit of difference anyways.

737
00:44:11,211 --> 00:44:12,815
Trattman's got to be hit,
and they know it.

738
00:44:12,913 --> 00:44:14,685
You know, you see...

739
00:44:14,778 --> 00:44:17,121
I don't...

740
00:44:17,213 --> 00:44:19,419
I don't understand that, I mean.

741
00:44:19,679 --> 00:44:21,780
Do I have to explain this twice?

742
00:44:22,979 --> 00:44:25,050
What do you think the guys
on the street think?

743
00:44:25,147 --> 00:44:26,680
I got no idea.

744
00:44:26,779 --> 00:44:28,725
They think Trattman...

745
00:44:28,815 --> 00:44:31,952
he did it before and now he did it again
and all he got was beat up.

746
00:44:32,048 --> 00:44:34,961
But he didn't really do anything.

747
00:44:35,051 --> 00:44:38,822
It's his responsibility. He did it
before and now it happened again...

748
00:44:38,916 --> 00:44:40,827
so he's responsible for what guys think.

749
00:44:40,918 --> 00:44:43,918
On the street, it's Trattman,
nothing but Trattman.

750
00:44:44,518 --> 00:44:48,293
Look, there's no two ways
about it, counselor.

751
00:44:48,384 --> 00:44:50,990
Trattman's gotta be hit.
He made a mistake.

752
00:44:54,821 --> 00:44:55,923
Oh, wait a minute. I get it.

753
00:44:56,020 --> 00:44:58,997
I see what you mean,
the public angle and all.

754
00:45:00,187 --> 00:45:01,393
Okay.

755
00:45:02,222 --> 00:45:03,699
Okay.

756
00:45:04,822 --> 00:45:08,632
Okay, if they agree with you,
assuming that...

757
00:45:10,890 --> 00:45:12,836
can you hit Trattman?

758
00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:15,199
Sure.

759
00:45:15,289 --> 00:45:17,700
Now, what about
this Squirrel fella because...

760
00:45:17,790 --> 00:45:20,631
he seems like
the leading candidate to me.

761
00:45:20,724 --> 00:45:22,931
Probably not.
I need Mickey for that one.

762
00:45:23,026 --> 00:45:25,436
Mickey? New York Mickey?

763
00:45:25,693 --> 00:45:27,229
Why can't you handle it?

764
00:45:27,328 --> 00:45:30,669
Cause Squirrel knows me.
Didn't I say that already?

765
00:45:30,761 --> 00:45:32,862
He needed something done once,
Dillon couldn't do it...

766
00:45:32,959 --> 00:45:34,632
so I did it, so he knows me.

767
00:45:34,728 --> 00:45:36,399
He's gonna figure if...

768
00:45:36,894 --> 00:45:38,999
he's waiting on somebody,
he's waiting on me or Dillon.

769
00:45:39,096 --> 00:45:40,439
So what?

770
00:45:40,964 --> 00:45:42,098
You ever killed anyone?

771
00:45:42,195 --> 00:45:43,697
No.

772
00:45:44,297 --> 00:45:46,038
It can get touchy-feely.

773
00:45:46,132 --> 00:45:47,700
Touchy-feely?

774
00:45:48,065 --> 00:45:50,974
Emotional, not fun, a lot of fuss.

775
00:45:51,064 --> 00:45:52,836
They cry, they plead, they beg...

776
00:45:52,930 --> 00:45:55,433
they piss themselves,
they call for their mothers.

777
00:45:55,999 --> 00:45:57,670
It gets embarrassing.

778
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:01,037
I like to kill them softly...

779
00:46:01,802 --> 00:46:04,369
from a distance,
not close enough for feelings.

780
00:46:04,635 --> 00:46:06,808
Don't like feelings.
Don't want to think about them.

781
00:46:06,903 --> 00:46:08,808
You need Mickey. What's the problem?

782
00:46:08,899 --> 00:46:10,435
Mickey is expensive.

783
00:46:10,701 --> 00:46:12,180
Not at the moment.

784
00:46:13,304 --> 00:46:14,904
You get him for 10?

785
00:46:15,002 --> 00:46:16,072

786
785
00:46:18,308 --> 00:46:19,082
He'd do it for 15?

787
00:46:17,037 --> 00:46:18,448
15, asshole.

788
00:46:18,705 --> 00:46:20,682
I think in this economy,
a quick 16 for two days work...

789
00:46:20,771 --> 00:46:22,717
would sound pretty good to Mickey.

790
00:46:23,807 --> 00:46:24,908
We'll sell him a party.

791
00:46:25,006 --> 00:46:27,642
Fly in, whack a guy, fly out, quick 15.

792
00:46:28,372 --> 00:46:29,974
Fly coach.

793
00:46:43,444 --> 00:46:47,146
Americas financial system
is intricate and complex.

794
00:46:47,241 --> 00:46:49,083
But behind all the technical terminology

795
00:46:49,175 --> 00:46:51,244
is a critical human factor.

796
00:46:53,444 --> 00:46:54,946
Confidence.

797
00:46:58,013 --> 00:47:00,219
Confidence in our financial systems
is essential...

798
00:47:00,314 --> 00:47:02,845
to the smooth operation
of our economy...

799
00:47:02,944 --> 00:47:05,982
and recently
that confidence has been shaken.

800
00:47:08,246 --> 00:47:10,851
All of us have a responsibility
to solve this crisis...

801
00:47:10,948 --> 00:47:11,823
because it affects

802
00:47:11,914 --> 00:47:15,359
the financial well-being
of every single American.

803
00:47:15,449 --> 00:47:19,053
The House of Representatives
failed to act on Monday.

804
00:47:19,150 --> 00:47:24,093
We saw the single largest decline
in the stock market in two decades.

805
00:47:24,182 --> 00:47:25,217
But in the end of the day,

806
00:47:25,317 --> 00:47:29,921
there's no real separation...between
Wall Street and Main Street.

807
00:47:30,018 --> 00:47:32,965
There's only the road
we're traveling on as Americans...

808
00:47:33,054 --> 00:47:35,121
and we will rise or fall on that journey

809
00:47:35,219 --> 00:47:37,256
as one nation, as one people.

810
00:47:37,354 --> 00:47:38,955
Hey, come here.

811
00:47:39,687 --> 00:47:41,322
So where'd you have to go for these?

812
00:47:42,153 --> 00:47:43,325
Sir?

813
00:47:44,288 --> 00:47:47,095
I said, where did you
have to go for these?

814
00:47:48,957 --> 00:47:50,402
Out of the building, right?

815
00:47:51,857 --> 00:47:54,360
What, you have to walk a couple blocks,
take a cab or something?

816
00:47:54,459 --> 00:47:58,161
No, sir, we only have one man
on service today and he's very busy.

817
00:47:59,190 --> 00:48:00,133
Are the drinks all right?

818
00:48:00,224 --> 00:48:03,225
No, as a matter of fact, they're mostly
evaporated by the time you get here.

819
00:48:03,324 --> 00:48:05,270
Mickey. Yeah, the drinks are all right.

820
00:48:05,359 --> 00:48:06,394
Bring me another one.

821
00:48:06,661 --> 00:48:07,865
Yes, sir.

822
00:48:11,663 --> 00:48:14,105
You mind if I drink
that beer while I'm waiting for...

823
00:48:14,194 --> 00:48:16,399
Lurch to get back
from the airport over here?

824
00:48:17,894 --> 00:48:19,874
Make you fat, though,
I thought you said.

825
00:48:19,963 --> 00:48:21,237
Yeah.

826
00:48:36,364 --> 00:48:39,206
So they grabbed me down in Maryland
on this gun thing.

827
00:48:39,298 --> 00:48:40,971
What gun thing?

828
00:48:41,067 --> 00:48:44,048
Well, I was going hunting,
for Christ's sake.

829
00:48:44,437 --> 00:48:47,903
Me and this guy, Topper.
You know Topper?

830
00:48:48,003 --> 00:48:49,309
No.
-Nice guy.

831
00:48:49,403 --> 00:48:51,844
Anyway, we were going down
to Maryland to hunt geese...

832
00:48:51,933 --> 00:48:53,776
down at Maryland shore.

833
00:48:54,703 --> 00:48:56,372
Then we go down there and...

834
00:48:56,467 --> 00:48:58,743
all of a sudden, there's a couple
hundred cops all over the place...

835
00:48:58,836 --> 00:49:00,836
and I got the shotgun in the trunk.

836
00:49:01,137 --> 00:49:02,673
Fucking beautiful.

837
00:49:03,139 --> 00:49:05,050
Fucking shotgun,
I just bought the fucking shotgun.

838
00:49:05,141 --> 00:49:06,947
I never even used it once.

839
00:49:07,673 --> 00:49:09,809
Now, I'm under arrest...

840
00:49:09,905 --> 00:49:11,780
felony possession,

841
00:49:11,872 --> 00:49:13,715
so I might go to jail
for a fucking shotgun...

842
00:49:13,807 --> 00:49:17,716
I bought in a fucking store to hunt
fucking geese with, for Christ's sake.

843
00:49:17,806 --> 00:49:19,046
Jesus.

844
00:49:23,375 --> 00:49:25,286
Did you bring him a beer?

845
00:49:25,377 --> 00:49:27,908
No, sir, he only wanted the one,
I thought.

846
00:49:28,941 --> 00:49:30,045
What?

847
00:49:30,143 --> 00:49:32,383
He only wanted one drink, I thought.

848
00:49:32,477 --> 00:49:34,421
I'm drinking his beer.

849
00:49:34,978 --> 00:49:35,786
I'm drinking the man's beer.

850
00:49:35,879 --> 00:49:37,449
Get him a beer.
-I don't want another one.

851
00:49:38,181 --> 00:49:39,451
It's all right.

852
00:49:43,147 --> 00:49:44,817
All right, don't have no more.

853
00:49:46,745 --> 00:49:47,450
So, yeah, Topper--

854
00:49:47,713 --> 00:49:49,917
You're hitting that stuff pretty hard,
aren't you, Mickey?

855
00:49:53,315 --> 00:49:54,916
I can handle it.

856
00:49:57,283 --> 00:49:59,889
So, Topper, yeah, Topper...

857
00:49:59,986 --> 00:50:02,758
he feels responsible and,
you know, he's an old guy.

858
00:50:02,851 --> 00:50:04,794
He hasn't been pinched
in about 30 years.

859
00:50:04,884 --> 00:50:07,225
So we figure
the shotguns are gonna be his.

860
00:50:07,316 --> 00:50:10,455
I'm just doing the old man a favor
driving him down there and all.

861
00:50:12,785 --> 00:50:14,423
Yeah, but if they don't--

862
00:50:16,055 --> 00:50:17,463
I do time.

863
00:50:18,754 --> 00:50:21,357
If the shotguns aren't his, I do time.

864
00:50:21,454 --> 00:50:23,124
It's that simple.

865
00:50:26,256 --> 00:50:29,461
Done it before. I can do it again.

866
00:50:30,089 --> 00:50:31,966
Rough on the wife, though.

867
00:50:32,391 --> 00:50:33,867
Yeah.

868
00:50:38,323 --> 00:50:41,062
The last time,
she actually took out the papers.

869
00:50:43,723 --> 00:50:45,327
I didn't blame her.

870
00:50:46,292 --> 00:50:48,499
She's been through it twice before.

871
00:50:52,395 --> 00:50:54,769
So the papers come up.
I was gonna sign them, you know...

872
00:50:54,860 --> 00:50:56,861
let her have what she wants
if that's what she wants.

873
00:50:56,961 --> 00:50:58,370
The girl don't owe me nothing.

874
00:51:00,261 --> 00:51:02,298
But I asked her to come up.

875
00:51:02,396 --> 00:51:05,736
I says, “Margie, do this for me.
Don't do nothing now.

876
00:51:05,828 --> 00:51:09,332
Do like when I come out
the last time and decide then.“

877
00:51:10,698 --> 00:51:12,234
She looks at me.

878
00:51:12,700 --> 00:51:14,337
She says, “And you promised me then-J'

879
00:51:14,434 --> 00:51:16,465
She says, “And you promised me
then you were through...

880
00:51:16,730 --> 00:51:18,868
and here I am again
and I'll wait five more years...

881
00:51:18,964 --> 00:51:21,035
and I'll be five more years older...

882
00:51:21,131 --> 00:51:23,907
and you're gonna get out again
and you're gonna do something else.“

883
00:51:27,100 --> 00:51:30,513
And I said, “Margie, I mean,
what can I say? You're right.

884
00:51:30,769 --> 00:51:33,178
You're right,
but all I'm asking you to do...

885
00:51:33,267 --> 00:51:35,338
is wait till I come out again.“

886
00:51:35,803 --> 00:51:37,939
Cause I don't know who the guy is.

887
00:51:39,703 --> 00:51:41,205
But I did.

888
00:51:41,304 --> 00:51:43,747
I did. I knew she was seeing somebody.

889
00:51:43,837 --> 00:51:46,716
I knew two days after
she was with him the first time...

890
00:51:46,807 --> 00:51:50,477
and I didn't like the feeling it gave me
in my nuts knowing it.

891
00:51:52,105 --> 00:51:54,083
But I didn't blame him.

892
00:51:57,708 --> 00:51:59,844
Anyway, I said, “Margie...

893
00:52:00,874 --> 00:52:02,944
you ought to do this for me.

894
00:52:03,042 --> 00:52:06,249
I ought to be around the same as him...

895
00:52:06,744 --> 00:52:09,414
because you and me,
we always got along all right.“

896
00:52:13,776 --> 00:52:17,347
Then she started crying
and shaking her head and...

897
00:52:18,245 --> 00:52:21,189
I thought, you know--

898
00:52:22,380 --> 00:52:24,121
But she didn't.

899
00:52:25,480 --> 00:52:27,287
And it was all right.

900
00:52:32,046 --> 00:52:33,524
You're not having any more of those.

901
00:52:33,780 --> 00:52:35,384
You'll fall on your ass if you do.

902
00:52:36,449 --> 00:52:39,451
I was drinking before you
got out of your father's cock.

903
00:52:39,717 --> 00:52:41,287
Don't tell me what I do.

904
00:52:46,184 --> 00:52:49,025
Next time, you know,
she takes out the papers...

905
00:52:50,919 --> 00:52:52,761
I'm just gonna sign them...

906
00:52:53,517 --> 00:52:55,929
because ifs too fucking rough on me.

907
00:52:57,787 --> 00:52:59,287
Check.

908
00:52:59,387 --> 00:53:01,797
Terrible amount of shit
you got to go through.

909
00:53:03,785 --> 00:53:05,263
What are you gonna do?

910
00:53:06,520 --> 00:53:08,431
Do the best you can.

911
00:53:10,022 --> 00:53:12,331
What, am I gonna leave the country like
some fucking draft dodger or something?

912
00:53:12,423 --> 00:53:14,061
Fuck that.

913
00:53:16,725 --> 00:53:21,363
Besides, none of this shit
means anything anyway.

914
00:53:29,193 --> 00:53:31,171
It's all bullshit.

915
00:53:39,961 --> 00:53:41,404
So what are we doing?

916
00:53:49,062 --> 00:53:50,507
We got two guys.

917
00:53:50,764 --> 00:53:51,435
Actually, there's four guys,

918
00:53:51,531 --> 00:53:54,305
but it takes fucking forever
to get the okay around here.

919
00:53:54,399 --> 00:53:57,038
So we got two guys for sure

920
00:53:57,134 --> 00:54:00,405
and one them knows me, so here you are.

921
00:54:02,066 --> 00:54:04,271
So, what, you want me
to do a double or what?

922
00:54:04,900 --> 00:54:07,881
You want to take the double,
it's all right with me. You need that?

923
00:54:10,902 --> 00:54:13,379
Look, I ought to
take you up on it, but...

924
00:54:13,469 --> 00:54:14,969
I'm not supposed to
be up here, you know.

925
00:54:15,068 --> 00:54:17,774
I'm restricted in New York
and Maryland and all that shit.

926
00:54:18,970 --> 00:54:21,276
I want to go anywhere,
I'm supposed to ask them.

927
00:54:21,368 --> 00:54:23,370
Well, I didn't ask them.

928
00:54:26,238 --> 00:54:29,219
So I probably shouldn't be up here
anymore than I have to, you know.

929
00:54:31,005 --> 00:54:33,006
Besides, a double's risky.

930
00:54:37,005 --> 00:54:38,507
I'll just take the one.

931
00:54:38,773 --> 00:54:40,013
Okay.

932
00:54:40,374 --> 00:54:43,318
Now, here's the thing.
That's gonna be the guy that knows me.

933
00:54:43,408 --> 00:54:44,545
The other guy, I'm doing.

934
00:54:44,808 --> 00:54:47,013
I'm gonna put his light out tonight
if everything goes right.

935
00:54:54,977 --> 00:54:56,114
Fuck.

936
00:55:01,446 --> 00:55:03,081
What are we gonna do, Jackie?

937
00:55:04,012 --> 00:55:05,752
Never mind thinking about
what I'm gonna do.

938
00:55:05,847 --> 00:55:07,845
You just think about
what you're gonna do.

939
00:55:08,879 --> 00:55:10,857
I'm gonna make some money, right?

940
00:55:10,946 --> 00:55:14,356
500, same as always.
500, you don't fuck anything up.

941
00:55:14,446 --> 00:55:16,289
When did I ever fuck
anything up with you?

942
00:55:16,381 --> 00:55:18,824
Kenny, the world's full of guys
that never fucked up...

943
00:55:18,914 --> 00:55:20,916
and then they fucked up once
and now they're doing time...

944
00:55:21,016 --> 00:55:24,052
so tonight's not the night to start,
not when I'm with you.

945
00:55:25,783 --> 00:55:27,558
I never fucked anything up.

946
00:55:38,253 --> 00:55:39,459
Where's the fucking car?

947
00:55:39,554 --> 00:55:40,462
It's around the side. I thought you said

948
00:55:40,553 --> 00:55:41,429
Never mind what you thought I said.

949
00:55:41,521 --> 00:55:43,192
Move your big, dumb ass.
He's going home.

950
00:55:43,287 --> 00:55:44,027
I don't get it.

951
00:55:44,122 --> 00:55:46,427
Yeah, neither is he tonight.
Never again, either.

952
00:55:46,953 --> 00:55:49,331
Come on, for Christ's sake.
I want to get home early for a change.

953
00:55:50,422 --> 00:55:52,024
Put the dollar back.

954
00:55:52,122 --> 00:55:55,864
Put it back. For fuck's sake.

955
00:55:55,958 --> 00:55:59,492
America has the most talented,
productive...

956
00:55:59,758 --> 00:56:01,464
and entrepreneurial
workers in the world.

957
00:56:15,228 --> 00:56:18,568
Right up easy, nice and smooth.

958
00:56:27,563 --> 00:56:29,267
Right up next to him, Kenny...

959
00:56:29,995 --> 00:56:32,202
and a little bit ahead.
Put me right up next to him.

960
00:58:34,055 --> 00:58:38,002
The first one, she wasn't bad.

961
00:58:38,092 --> 00:58:40,864
She wasn't good, but she wasn't bad.
She was all right.

962
00:58:41,424 --> 00:58:43,562
She seemed like she was
in an awful hurry, though.

963
00:58:43,824 --> 00:58:46,961
Honey, could you zip me up?

964
00:58:48,024 --> 00:58:49,830
No.

965
00:58:51,191 --> 00:58:52,898
I thought you were kidding.

966
00:58:52,993 --> 00:58:55,562
No. Get your trick to do it.

967
00:58:55,827 --> 00:58:58,171
You know, screwing's no different
than anything else.

968
00:58:58,263 --> 00:59:00,364
Nobody gives a good shit anymore.

969
00:59:00,461 --> 00:59:01,530
You hire somebody to do something,

970
00:59:01,795 --> 00:59:03,832
you tell them
you're willing to pay for it...

971
00:59:03,930 --> 00:59:06,338
they say they'll do it and they have to.

972
00:59:06,428 --> 00:59:07,906
Yeah, well, for a guy
who's been having himself

973
00:59:07,996 --> 00:59:09,133
a regular party for three days or

974
00:59:09,229 --> 00:59:11,228
so you sure bitch and moan a lot.

975
00:59:11,328 --> 00:59:13,933
I've been paying for it.
I can bitch about it if I want.

976
00:59:16,998 --> 00:59:18,943
So you know this broad Polly?

977
00:59:19,032 --> 00:59:20,204
Honey?

978
00:59:20,967 --> 00:59:23,134
Oh, ifs on the nightstand over there.

979
00:59:23,230 --> 00:59:25,073
The wallet's on the nightstand.

980
00:59:26,932 --> 00:59:28,934
Yeah, everybody knows Polly.

981
00:59:29,034 --> 00:59:31,071
Yeah, that's what the first broad
you sent up said.

982
00:59:31,170 --> 00:59:33,544
There's $283 in there, okay?

983
00:59:33,801 --> 00:59:36,473
When I get up, I want to
see $183 in there, you got that?

984
00:59:36,568 --> 00:59:39,274
Okay. No tip?

985
00:59:40,003 --> 00:59:41,844
No tip.

986
00:59:41,936 --> 00:59:43,140
You're the original sport.

987
00:59:43,235 --> 00:59:44,542
Fuck her.

988
00:59:46,804 --> 00:59:48,941
You want a tip, honey?
I'll give you a tip.

989
00:59:49,037 --> 00:59:50,983
You put the condom on with your mouth...

990
00:59:51,072 --> 00:59:54,278
and you stop acting like your anus
is a national treasure.

991
00:59:54,373 --> 00:59:56,283
You're a fucking hooker
for Christ's sake.

992
00:59:56,374 --> 00:59:57,351
Fuck you.

993
01:00:00,305 --> 01:00:01,840
Let me tell you something, honey.

994
01:00:01,939 --> 01:00:05,248
One day,
one old bastard that you milked...

995
01:00:05,340 --> 01:00:07,512
he's gonna carve you up,
talking like that.

996
01:00:08,875 --> 01:00:10,546
How would you like that?

997
01:00:10,809 --> 01:00:12,947
Jesus, I don't know.

998
01:00:13,043 --> 01:00:14,579
You think I'd come?

999
01:00:15,112 --> 01:00:17,849
If you could, maybe you would.

1000
01:00:17,943 --> 01:00:19,445
But I'm thinking no.

1001
01:00:20,378 --> 01:00:21,616
Fuck you.

1002
01:00:24,279 --> 01:00:27,052
Which is pretty much what I had in mind
when she come up here.

1003
01:00:33,113 --> 01:00:36,058
You know, I haven't had a real piece
of ass since Florida.

1004
01:00:37,413 --> 01:00:40,188
Sunny.
-Sunny. Yeah.

1005
01:00:43,549 --> 01:00:46,496
You probably fucked her too,
didn't you, after I left?

1006
01:00:46,585 --> 01:00:48,117
Mickey.

1007
01:00:48,216 --> 01:00:50,252
When me and Dillon got there,
she was with you.

1008
01:00:50,350 --> 01:00:51,988
When we left, she was still with you.

1009
01:00:52,085 --> 01:00:53,560
You were there, what?

1010
01:00:54,350 --> 01:00:55,156
Three weeks.

1011
01:00:55,249 --> 01:00:56,319
Three weeks.

1012
01:00:56,417 --> 01:00:58,895
I was there five days in the middle.

1013
01:00:58,984 --> 01:01:01,054
How the fuck am I gonna do that?

1014
01:01:03,288 --> 01:01:04,856
I don't know.

1015
01:01:06,655 --> 01:01:08,1000
Empty again.

1016
01:01:10,822 --> 01:01:12,628
You sure you won't join me?

1017
01:01:13,588 --> 01:01:15,463
Not late enough yet either.

1018
01:01:24,391 --> 01:01:26,130
Sammy fucked her.

1019
01:01:26,224 --> 01:01:27,532
Guy from Detroit,

1020
01:01:27,625 --> 01:01:28,968
sharp-looking little ginzo?

1021
01:01:29,060 --> 01:01:30,627
He's a fucking Jew.

1022
01:01:33,158 --> 01:01:35,160
All those years I knew that guy...

1023
01:01:36,526 --> 01:01:40,337
he fucking did it anyway, scumbag.

1024
01:01:43,294 --> 01:01:44,932
Son of a bitch.

1025
01:01:49,929 --> 01:01:52,068
I don't know why I care about this.

1026
01:01:54,229 --> 01:01:56,937
I mean, you know, I know when...

1027
01:01:57,032 --> 01:02:00,875
I'm there, I'm there, she's with me...

1028
01:02:00,966 --> 01:02:03,341
and when I leave and you're there,

1029
01:02:03,432 --> 01:02:05,137
she's with you.

1030
01:02:05,499 --> 01:02:07,272
She wasn't with me.

1031
01:02:08,300 --> 01:02:11,609
I don't mean you. I mean any guy.

1032
01:02:12,535 --> 01:02:14,206
Oh.

1033
01:02:21,236 --> 01:02:23,273
Yeah, I don't care.

1034
01:02:25,036 --> 01:02:26,139
It's not like I love her or nothing.

1035
01:02:26,236 --> 01:02:28,510
You know,
I just give her for when I'm there.

1036
01:02:31,871 --> 01:02:33,612
Fucking Sammy.

1037
01:02:34,607 --> 01:02:36,208
Mickey.

1038
01:02:38,607 --> 01:02:41,018
She good, you know, Sunny.

1039
01:02:41,106 --> 01:02:42,844
She's a good girl.

1040
01:02:44,574 --> 01:02:46,110
If she can't get you up,

1041
01:02:46,209 --> 01:02:47,844
you're probably dead.

1042
01:02:49,142 --> 01:02:50,644
And let me tell you something...

1043
01:02:50,909 --> 01:02:54,648
I've seen every kind
of ass there is in this world.

1044
01:02:54,909 --> 01:02:56,547
Yeah, you've seen it this week.

1045
01:02:56,644 --> 01:02:57,552
You been here, what, three days?

1046
01:02:57,643 --> 01:03:00,018
What I hear, you've seen
most of the ass in town.

1047
01:03:02,178 --> 01:03:05,918
Well, I like it. it's, like, my hobby.

1048
01:03:06,546 --> 01:03:08,251
Yeah, well, I couldn't fuck
like that for three days.

1049
01:03:08,346 --> 01:03:09,846
I get all fucked out.

1050
01:03:12,380 --> 01:03:14,084
You want ass?

1051
01:03:15,013 --> 01:03:18,184
There's no ass in the whole world...

1052
01:03:18,280 --> 01:03:20,883
like a young Jewish girl that's hooking.

1053
01:03:22,849 --> 01:03:24,622
I'm gonna keep that in mind.

1054
01:03:26,216 --> 01:03:28,093
You take that to the bank.

1055
01:03:37,951 --> 01:03:39,897
First time I met Sunny...

1056
01:03:41,219 --> 01:03:44,221
she walked in the room,
I got a fucking enormous hard-on.

1057
01:03:45,020 --> 01:03:47,964
I could have fought five guys
with this fucking prong I had.

1058
01:03:49,287 --> 01:03:52,891
So fucking hard,
the skin from under my eyes...

1059
01:03:52,988 --> 01:03:56,058
just kinda went down into the cock
so it could expand.

1060
01:03:56,156 --> 01:03:56,894
Mickey.

1061
01:03:56,988 --> 01:03:59,400
My fucking-you know, after,
I just wanted to fuck her so bad.

1062
01:03:59,490 --> 01:04:01,127
She was so fucking beautiful.

1063
01:04:01,225 --> 01:04:02,167
Mickey.

1064
01:04:02,257 --> 01:04:03,859
I felt like a man.
-Mick!

1065
01:04:03,957 --> 01:04:06,196
She made me feel good. What?

1066
01:04:08,557 --> 01:04:10,264
You gonna be all right...

1067
01:04:12,258 --> 01:04:15,236
tomorrow night, the next?

1068
01:04:19,861 --> 01:04:23,467
I'm all right now. What the fuck?
Leave me alone.

1069
01:04:23,563 --> 01:04:25,664
Look, this after, we're supposed to
meet a guy, all right?

1070
01:04:25,928 --> 01:04:28,340
I got a guy to take you around and all.

1071
01:04:35,129 --> 01:04:36,902
I can't go out.

1072
01:04:40,264 --> 01:04:42,368
What the fuck are you talking about?

1073
01:04:46,966 --> 01:04:48,443
No, I can't go out.

1074
01:04:51,566 --> 01:04:54,911
You come up here to do something,
remember? For that.

1075
01:04:56,602 --> 01:04:58,341
All right, go get him.

1076
01:04:58,434 --> 01:05:01,073
Go get the fucking guy
and we'll set this thing up.

1077
01:05:01,169 --> 01:05:03,545
Go get him now!
We'll set the fucking thing up!

1078
01:05:03,636 --> 01:05:04,307
Go get him!

1079
01:05:04,403 --> 01:05:07,471
You, I'm a tell you what you're gonna do.
You're gonna go to fucking bed.

1080
01:05:07,569 --> 01:05:10,605
It's 2:30 now, you shit.
I'm a call you at 7:130...

1081
01:05:10,871 --> 01:05:11,975
and if I don't wake you up,

1082
01:05:12,072 --> 01:05:14,050
I am gonna drop a dime
on a couple of cops

1083
01:05:14,138 --> 01:05:16,209
I know who are gonna take you back
to where you're supposed to be.

1084
01:05:16,307 --> 01:05:17,546
Yeah!
-Oh, yeah?

1085
01:05:17,639 --> 01:05:19,345
No ass. No more booze.

1086
01:05:19,440 --> 01:05:21,975
No nothing.
Get yourself a shower and go to bed.

1087
01:05:22,074 --> 01:05:23,982
I'll get you up and tell you
where you gotta be.

1088
01:05:24,073 --> 01:05:26,347
I don't take orders from shits like you!

1089
01:05:28,308 --> 01:05:31,548
7:30. Get some sleep.

1090
01:05:32,343 --> 01:05:33,978
He's been here three days.

1091
01:05:34,075 --> 01:05:37,078
What he didn't fuck in them
three days, he drank.

1092
01:05:37,177 --> 01:05:38,281
He was drunk when I left him.

1093
01:05:38,378 --> 01:05:40,912
2:00 in the afternoon and he's drunk.

1094
01:05:41,011 --> 01:05:42,251
And when I chew him out for it,

1095
01:05:42,346 --> 01:05:44,912
he's go out in the skivvies
and do the job now

1096
01:05:45,476 --> 01:05:46,955
Won't fucking shut up.

1097
01:05:47,011 --> 01:05:48,285
You asked for him.

1098
01:05:48,379 --> 01:05:50,982
You said you couldn't do it,
so we got you what you asked for.

1099
01:05:51,079 --> 01:05:53,114
I need the Mickey
from a couple of years ago.

1100
01:05:53,212 --> 01:05:54,213
He's fucking worthless now.

1101
01:05:54,313 --> 01:05:55,915
Did you talk to Dillon about it,

1102
01:05:56,013 --> 01:05:57,650
I mean, or is he even
able to talk to anybody?

1103
01:05:57,914 --> 01:05:59,120
Dillon thinks what I think.

1104
01:05:59,215 --> 01:06:00,523
We need this guy out of town yesterday.

1105
01:06:00,615 --> 01:06:03,149
You invited him here. Send him back.

1106
01:06:05,650 --> 01:06:07,559
Won't go. He needs the dough.

1107
01:06:07,650 --> 01:06:09,992
Well, I cant get in touch
with him today.

1108
01:06:11,317 --> 01:06:13,225
It's not like that.

1109
01:06:14,351 --> 01:06:16,922
What I got in mind,
I'm gonna get him grabbed.

1110
01:06:18,884 --> 01:06:20,453
Won't he talk?

1111
01:06:21,218 --> 01:06:23,423
If he thought it was me who did it,
he might.

1112
01:06:25,119 --> 01:06:26,530
Let's just say
in about a day from now...

1113
01:06:26,621 --> 01:06:30,430
he's gonna get into a fight with a whore
in a hotel that don't like whore fights.

1114
01:06:31,022 --> 01:06:32,022
He's gonna get busted for that.

1115
01:06:32,122 --> 01:06:33,895
They'll revoke his bail,
and back he'll go.

1116
01:06:33,989 --> 01:06:35,933
Kind of rough on him.

1117
01:06:36,687 --> 01:06:38,665
Actually,
I think it's the best thing for him.

1118
01:06:38,921 --> 01:06:41,424
Won't get enough potato jack
in the can to kill him.

1119
01:06:41,523 --> 01:06:43,966
And if he's not in the can,
he's going to kill us.

1120
01:06:44,589 --> 01:06:46,363
So how much is the girl gonna cost?

1121
01:06:46,456 --> 01:06:47,594
$500, maybe a grand.

1122
01:06:47,690 --> 01:06:48,691
Oh, Jesus.

1123
01:06:48,958 --> 01:06:49,525
It's a grand.

1124
01:06:49,624 --> 01:06:51,501
Yeah, well, I still got to okay it.

1125
01:06:51,592 --> 01:06:53,970
You know, this running back to them
every time with the latest bad news...

1126
01:06:54,061 --> 01:06:55,262
they're raising hell with me.

1127
01:06:55,358 --> 01:06:56,631
Well, we got a little problem.

1128
01:06:56,892 --> 01:07:00,132
We weren't supposed to have
any little problems, no problems at all.

1129
01:07:01,927 --> 01:07:04,339
Please don't smoke in my car, please.
Come on.

1130
01:07:29,532 --> 01:07:31,601
All right, looks like
our boy finally made it.

1131
01:07:36,469 --> 01:07:39,072
Yeah, I've got him now.
He's about to enter the building.

1132
01:07:59,605 --> 01:08:01,311
All units, this is unit three.

1133
01:08:01,406 --> 01:08:03,613
He's headed
to the lockers on the west side.

1134
01:08:56,518 --> 01:08:58,520
You have the right to remain silent.

1135
01:09:02,485 --> 01:09:04,519
You have any guns, knives,
or anything else I should know about...

1136
01:09:04,617 --> 01:09:06,220
needles or anything
I'm gonna get stuck on?

1137
01:09:06,318 --> 01:09:07,592
I dunno, maybe.

1138
01:09:07,686 --> 01:09:09,029
What?
-Yeah.

1139
01:09:09,121 --> 01:09:10,961
Yes or no?
-Left pocket, left jacket pocket.

1140
01:09:11,053 --> 01:09:14,329
You have the right to talk to a lawyer
for advice before we ask you questions.

1141
01:09:14,422 --> 01:09:15,125
Don't move that hand.

1142
01:09:15,221 --> 01:09:18,064
If you cannot afford a lawyer,
one will be appointed for you.

1143
01:09:18,156 --> 01:09:20,430
Do you understand
what I've just read to you, sir?

1144
01:09:21,489 --> 01:09:23,059
That poor bastard.

1145
01:09:23,424 --> 01:09:24,528
You know, I knew this was gonna happen.

1146
01:09:24,625 --> 01:09:27,430
I told him, you know.
What the fuck, you know.

1147
01:09:28,023 --> 01:09:29,330
You know, I like the guy.

1148
01:09:29,423 --> 01:09:31,367
You know, he was always
all right to me, you know...

1149
01:09:31,456 --> 01:09:33,436
and now I can't do nothing to help him?

1150
01:09:33,525 --> 01:09:35,129
Took his chances.

1151
01:09:35,427 --> 01:09:37,335
Sure, John,
and you're taking your chances...

1152
01:09:37,424 --> 01:09:38,663
and I'm taking my chances, all right...

1153
01:09:38,925 --> 01:09:40,927
and sooner or later,
they're gonna grab us.

1154
01:09:41,460 --> 01:09:44,564
You know, and then who am I
gonna call, you know, you?

1155
01:09:47,695 --> 01:09:50,674
I haven't got no friends either.
You know, you look at it.

1156
01:09:50,930 --> 01:09:52,738
You, me, and Russell are in exactly
the same position...

1157
01:09:52,994 --> 01:09:54,701
except for he's in it now
and we're not in it yet.

1158
01:09:54,963 --> 01:09:56,702
Frankie, you gotta relax.

1159
01:09:56,963 --> 01:09:58,169
It's like Trattman.

1160
01:09:58,262 --> 01:10:00,240
It come out just like you said.

1161
01:10:00,329 --> 01:10:01,603
You know, when it didn't happen and...

1162
01:10:01,697 --> 01:10:03,040
Russell was telling me
all that stuff, you know...

1163
01:10:03,132 --> 01:10:05,370
I was scared shitless
it wasn't gonna happen.

1164
01:10:05,464 --> 01:10:07,375
You know, I thought
it was gonna happen to me.

1165
01:10:07,633 --> 01:10:12,044
You know, that don't mean--well, yeah,
I mean, I'm glad it happened to him...

1166
01:10:12,134 --> 01:10:14,667
but I still wish it didn't even
happen to him, you know?

1167
01:10:14,933 --> 01:10:16,537
It didn't have to.

1168
01:10:17,235 --> 01:10:19,236
It's just shit, you know.

1169
01:10:20,267 --> 01:10:22,211
This world is just shit.

1170
01:10:24,101 --> 01:10:26,010
We're all just on our own.

1171
01:10:33,270 --> 01:10:35,510
What the fuck, man, whatcha gonna do?

1172
01:10:35,605 --> 01:10:36,946
Get off my block, bitch!

1173
01:10:37,038 --> 01:10:38,016
This my block!

1174
01:10:38,105 --> 01:10:39,981
I run this motherfucking block!

1175
01:10:40,073 --> 01:10:41,177
Get off my block!

1176
01:10:41,274 --> 01:10:42,977
What you gonna do? What you gonna do?

1177
01:10:43,072 --> 01:10:46,517
I run this show! I run this show!

1178
01:10:46,607 --> 01:10:49,518
What you gonna do, homey?
Get off my fucking block, man!

1179
01:10:49,608 --> 01:10:51,313
Get off my block!

1180
01:10:52,340 --> 01:10:54,683
Our eye now is to the future...

1181
01:10:54,942 --> 01:10:57,548
to shine the bright light
of accountability.

1182
01:10:58,041 --> 01:10:58,415
Can I get you a Bud?

1183
01:10:59,409 --> 01:11:00,752
Yeah.

1184
01:11:01,010 --> 01:11:02,250
Bottle or draft?

1185
01:11:02,345 --> 01:11:03,720
I don't give a shit.

1186
01:11:07,613 --> 01:11:09,316
They always do that.

1187
01:11:09,410 --> 01:11:10,650
Pain in the ass.

1188
01:11:11,178 --> 01:11:13,555
Wouldn't come in here I know
I got to go through shit like that.

1189
01:11:14,445 --> 01:11:15,388
Shit, I would.

1190
01:11:15,478 --> 01:11:18,185
This guy, I don't know how he does it.

1191
01:11:18,280 --> 01:11:21,417
He must have the best-built girls
in town working for him.

1192
01:11:21,514 --> 01:11:23,016
I come in here every day.

1193
01:11:23,115 --> 01:11:24,287
I know.

1194
01:11:27,214 --> 01:11:29,125
I've never seen you in here before.

1195
01:11:29,951 --> 01:11:31,394
Look, I don't know you.

1196
01:11:31,483 --> 01:11:33,222
Very few guys know me.

1197
01:11:33,649 --> 01:11:35,627
I've never been here before in my life.

1198
01:11:40,752 --> 01:11:42,696
I was looking for you.

1199
01:11:44,618 --> 01:11:47,062
A guy told me you come in here
a lot around this time of the day,

1200
01:11:47,152 --> 01:11:48,653
so I came in.

1201
01:11:52,987 --> 01:11:54,466
Who's the guy?

1202
01:11:54,989 --> 01:11:57,090
The guy? A friend.

1203
01:11:58,322 --> 01:12:00,164
A friend of yours, actually.

1204
01:12:02,122 --> 01:12:03,463
Who is the friend?

1205
01:12:03,555 --> 01:12:04,966
A friend.

1206
01:12:05,057 --> 01:12:07,058
Your friends
are worried about you, Frankie.

1207
01:12:08,222 --> 01:12:10,598
They think you need somebody around...

1208
01:12:10,690 --> 01:12:13,601
who knows about things, advise you...

1209
01:12:13,691 --> 01:12:16,103
teach you how to cover your ass.

1210
01:12:17,461 --> 01:12:19,335
Yeah?
-Yeah.

1211
01:12:19,427 --> 01:12:22,370
See, ifs not so much
what you've been doing.

1212
01:12:23,160 --> 01:12:25,331
It's what guys think
you've been doing...

1213
01:12:25,627 --> 01:12:28,004
and that's what you got to look out for.

1214
01:12:28,095 --> 01:12:30,198
And when it happens...

1215
01:12:30,594 --> 01:12:32,595
you got to be prepared to do something.

1216
01:12:34,530 --> 01:12:36,007
Yeah.

1217
01:12:39,597 --> 01:12:42,403
So where's he gonna be tomorrow night?

1218
01:12:44,699 --> 01:12:46,334
Who?

1219
01:12:47,764 --> 01:12:52,108
Johnny Amato. Tomorrow night,
where's he gonna be?

1220
01:12:57,166 --> 01:12:58,509
I don't know.

1221
01:12:58,600 --> 01:13:00,238
Frank.

1222
01:13:00,735 --> 01:13:03,043
You got to keep in mind what I told you.

1223
01:13:03,135 --> 01:13:05,135
Your friends are worried about you.

1224
01:13:05,235 --> 01:13:07,712
It's your friends that want to see you
get a second chance...

1225
01:13:07,969 --> 01:13:09,380
you know what I mean?

1226
01:13:09,470 --> 01:13:12,641
And it's your friends that wanna
know where Squirrel's gonna be.

1227
01:13:12,737 --> 01:13:15,647
Yeah, well, I don't know
who the fuck you are.

1228
01:13:15,737 --> 01:13:17,647
Very few guys do.

1229
01:13:18,637 --> 01:13:20,639
Well, Dillon, maybe.

1230
01:13:22,974 --> 01:13:24,713
Yeah, Dillon knows me.

1231
01:13:28,141 --> 01:13:29,515
Yeah.

1232
01:13:32,009 --> 01:13:33,611
You want me to call Dillon for you...

1233
01:13:33,709 --> 01:13:37,118
so you can talk to Dillon
and see who I am?

1234
01:13:43,610 --> 01:13:45,349
No.

1235
01:13:45,444 --> 01:13:47,514
Okay, then, where's he gonna be?

1236
01:13:54,679 --> 01:13:57,021
I haven't got no idea.

1237
01:14:09,581 --> 01:14:11,060
Okay.

1238
01:14:16,584 --> 01:14:18,562
See you around, Frankie, my friend.

1239
01:14:20,251 --> 01:14:21,786
No, no, hey, wait a minute.

1240
01:14:22,052 --> 01:14:23,791
Fuck you, I don't get paid to wait.

1241
01:14:24,052 --> 01:14:26,790
You tell me you don't know, okay.
I accept that.

1242
01:14:27,051 --> 01:14:30,154
But I got something to do.
I got to find a guy who does know.

1243
01:14:30,251 --> 01:14:32,356
Where John's gonna be tomorrow night?

1244
01:14:33,685 --> 01:14:36,598
Yeah. There's something else now,
I guess...

1245
01:14:37,656 --> 01:14:40,327
like where you're gonna
be the day after.

1246
01:14:45,723 --> 01:14:50,327
Except you're in a position
very few guys ever get in.

1247
01:14:50,422 --> 01:14:54,197
You can do something about it.
You have choices.

1248
01:14:55,025 --> 01:14:58,095
I've known very few guys
in a position like that.

1249
01:15:06,693 --> 01:15:09,400
Kid, I hope you don't think
I'm shitting you.

1250
01:15:20,264 --> 01:15:22,399
Kid, I hate to see you go like this.

1251
01:15:23,630 --> 01:15:25,733
And you're going for fucking nothing.

1252
01:15:25,998 --> 01:15:28,475
Jesus, look, I can't do this, like--

1253
01:15:28,564 --> 01:15:31,170
Let me ask you something.
You think about this.

1254
01:15:31,266 --> 01:15:33,471
You think I was to go down
to Wollaston and see him there...

1255
01:15:33,567 --> 01:15:37,479
now and I would say,
“Squirrel, ifs you or Frankie...

1256
01:15:37,569 --> 01:15:38,375
who's it gonna be?“

1257
01:15:38,468 --> 01:15:40,069
You think he'd even
think twice about it?

1258
01:15:40,166 --> 01:15:41,543
You think he would?

1259
01:15:42,534 --> 01:15:43,772
I don't know.

1260
01:15:44,034 --> 01:15:44,808
Asshole.

1261
01:15:45,067 --> 01:15:47,478
Fucking asshole.

1262
01:15:47,569 --> 01:15:49,239
It's no wonder you did time.
-Look, I--

1263
01:15:49,334 --> 01:15:50,813
I don't have to look.
I know what's going on.

1264
01:15:51,069 --> 01:15:53,515
I know what I gotta do.
I gotta find the right guy.

1265
01:15:53,605 --> 01:15:55,674
Now, make the pick, kid,
and make it now.

1266
01:15:55,772 --> 01:15:57,612
I'm gonna do you a favor.
I'm not gonna do you a favor.

1267
01:15:57,704 --> 01:15:59,478
It don't matter to me.
-Just let me think.

1268
01:15:59,572 --> 01:16:02,483
Oh, no thinking.
Go or no go right now.

1269
01:16:02,573 --> 01:16:03,482
I gotta get going-

1270
01:16:03,573 --> 01:16:07,415
Fucking Jesus. Look, I don't know
if I can do this, you know.

1271
01:16:07,740 --> 01:16:09,685
Can you do the other thing?

1272
01:16:16,741 --> 01:16:18,242
No.

1273
01:16:19,609 --> 01:16:21,087
Okay.

1274
01:16:21,176 --> 01:16:23,278
So I guess you know then.

1275
01:16:25,411 --> 01:16:26,754
That's the selection.

1276
01:16:32,746 --> 01:16:37,213
All right. So, what do I got to do?

1277
01:16:37,313 --> 01:16:39,221
You got to find out
where Johnny's gonna be.

1278
01:16:40,045 --> 01:16:41,285
I already know.

1279
01:16:41,380 --> 01:16:42,688
Yeah?

1280
01:16:43,380 --> 01:16:46,758
He's got a girl.
You know, he told me that before.

1281
01:16:47,583 --> 01:16:49,652
Okay, and where you gonna be?

1282
01:16:51,115 --> 01:16:54,026
I told him I'd be home, I'd be home.

1283
01:16:54,116 --> 01:16:55,093
No, you're not.

1284
01:16:55,182 --> 01:16:55,626
I'm not?

1285
01:16:55,716 --> 01:16:57,387
No.
-Where?

1286
01:16:57,483 --> 01:17:00,325
You're gonna be with me
and we're gonna be where he's gonna be.

1287
01:17:00,417 --> 01:17:03,726
Jesus, look, I can't do that.
Look, if he sees me, it's all over.

1288
01:17:03,818 --> 01:17:06,729
He's gonna know somethings wrong.
I can't do that.

1289
01:17:06,819 --> 01:17:08,196
I'll tell you--

1290
01:17:08,287 --> 01:17:10,125
Okay, Okay-

1291
01:17:10,218 --> 01:17:13,198
So you made
the other choice then I guess.

1292
01:17:17,321 --> 01:17:19,391
Have I really got to do that?

1293
01:17:20,756 --> 01:17:22,461
All of it?

1294
01:17:23,689 --> 01:17:25,498
I got to be there and everything?

1295
01:17:25,591 --> 01:17:28,761
Frank, you made a mistake...

1296
01:17:29,024 --> 01:17:32,058
and you got to show you understand
you made a mistake...

1297
01:17:32,156 --> 01:17:34,100
and you gotta make things right...

1298
01:17:35,224 --> 01:17:37,498
otherwise they're gonna
want someone to do something...

1299
01:17:37,591 --> 01:17:39,434
like with Trattman.

1300
01:17:41,395 --> 01:17:43,236
Never did the right thing.

1301
01:18:25,536 --> 01:18:27,534
Jack, he's not a bad guy, you know.

1302
01:18:27,634 --> 01:18:29,409
I mean, he's not a bad guy at all.

1303
01:18:30,202 --> 01:18:33,306
None of them are, kid.
They're all nice guys.

1304
01:18:36,804 --> 01:18:38,441
He was always all right to me.

1305
01:18:38,538 --> 01:18:41,312
Sure, got you almost six years
in the fucking slammer.

1306
01:18:41,406 --> 01:18:43,314
That wasn't his fault.

1307
01:18:43,405 --> 01:18:45,247
Kid, when somebody does something...

1308
01:18:45,339 --> 01:18:47,749
and gets somebody else jail for it,
it's his fault.

1309
01:18:47,839 --> 01:18:49,215
That's the rule.

1310
01:18:49,306 --> 01:18:51,251
Well, he didn't mean it.

1311
01:18:52,075 --> 01:18:55,349
That's got nothing to do with it,
nothing at all.

1312
01:18:58,807 --> 01:19:00,046
That them?

1313
01:19:00,141 --> 01:19:02,450
No, John's got a Caddy.

1314
01:19:02,542 --> 01:19:05,281
I know what he's got.
What I want to know is, that them?

1315
01:19:05,375 --> 01:19:08,254
Nope. I'd have said it if it was.

1316
01:19:10,412 --> 01:19:13,085
I think you got him all wrong.
You know, that jail thing...

1317
01:19:13,180 --> 01:19:14,418
you know, he had it worse than I did,

1318
01:19:14,513 --> 01:19:16,512
you know,
with his family and everything.

1319
01:19:16,612 --> 01:19:18,784
He's never gonna have to do it again.

1320
01:19:41,717 --> 01:19:42,787
That's him.

1321
01:19:43,052 --> 01:19:44,586
I'm not sure.

1322
01:19:47,085 --> 01:19:48,722
Yes, you are.

1323
01:20:21,726 --> 01:20:23,603
How long is he gonna be, kid?

1324
01:20:23,694 --> 01:20:25,433
I don't know.

1325
01:20:26,460 --> 01:20:28,438
Okay, I asked you nice.

1326
01:20:28,527 --> 01:20:29,505
Now, does he fuck her here

1327
01:20:29,594 --> 01:20:31,469
or does he fuck her someplace else?

1328
01:20:33,128 --> 01:20:35,106
She's got a roommate.

1329
01:20:35,662 --> 01:20:38,434
He knows a guy that's
got a motel down in Haverhill.

1330
01:20:42,463 --> 01:20:45,672
Okay. it's just gonna be friendly then.

1331
01:20:49,130 --> 01:20:53,701
Look, now, I was gonna get it started
and everything so we could have a start.

1332
01:20:53,799 --> 01:20:55,574
There's probably going to be
a lot of noise and...

1333
01:20:55,667 --> 01:20:58,145
I've known guys, heard a lot of noise...

1334
01:20:58,234 --> 01:20:59,803
got too good a start
and left somebody standing around...

1335
01:21:00,069 --> 01:21:01,638
with their thumb up their ass.

1336
01:21:56,612 --> 01:21:58,554
Fuck, fuck.

1337
01:23:04,427 --> 01:23:06,099
Give me that start, kid.

1338
01:23:21,396 --> 01:23:23,203
Kid, you're going too fast.

1339
01:23:24,497 --> 01:23:26,841
Jesus, they're gonna have
all kinds of cops up in here.

1340
01:23:27,100 --> 01:23:29,303
Yeah, and one of them's
gonna catch you. Slow down.

1341
01:23:32,564 --> 01:23:33,768
Kid.

1342
01:23:35,431 --> 01:23:37,502
Kid, just slow down.

1343
01:23:37,600 --> 01:23:38,576
I can't.

1344
01:23:38,666 --> 01:23:39,644
Kid, you got to.

1345
01:23:39,733 --> 01:23:41,541
Slow the fuck down.

1346
01:23:43,836 --> 01:23:45,711
Kid, my car's in Primrose.

1347
01:23:45,801 --> 01:23:49,269
We got a long way to go.
Just slow the fuck down.

1348
01:23:49,369 --> 01:23:51,277
You want to fucking drive?

1349
01:24:15,842 --> 01:24:17,410
You know what you got to do, right?

1350
01:24:17,508 --> 01:24:19,453
Sure. I go down to where my car is,

1351
01:24:19,542 --> 01:24:20,849
I leave this one, and I go home.

1352
01:24:21,110 --> 01:24:22,382
Just leave it?

1353
01:24:22,774 --> 01:24:25,810
Christ, I wipe it down.

1354
01:24:28,275 --> 01:24:29,651
You gonna be all right and everything?

1355
01:24:29,742 --> 01:24:31,813
Yeah, I'm gonna be fucking fine.

1356
01:24:35,579 --> 01:24:37,525
Where's your car parked again?

1357
01:24:37,614 --> 01:24:41,146
For Christ's sake,
it's in a lot down on Brownwood.

1358
01:24:41,245 --> 01:24:43,586
Okay, just making sure.

1359
01:24:43,678 --> 01:24:45,418
Sometimes guys forget.

1360
01:24:48,447 --> 01:24:50,118
I fucking got it.

1361
01:24:55,783 --> 01:24:57,193
Okay, you gonna remember now?

1362
01:24:57,283 --> 01:24:59,725
I know, I know.
I dump the fucking car...

1363
01:24:59,815 --> 01:25:03,455
and I don't go too fast
and I wear my fucking seat belt.

1364
01:26:52,273 --> 01:26:54,682
It's the answer spoken
by young and old...

1365
01:26:54,772 --> 01:26:59,218
rich and poor,
Democrat and Republican...

1366
01:26:59,307 --> 01:27:01,343
black, white, Hispanic,

1367
01:27:01,442 --> 01:27:03,149
Asian, Native American,

1368
01:27:03,244 --> 01:27:04,585
gay, straight...

1369
01:27:04,676 --> 01:27:06,846
disabled and not disabled.

1370
01:27:06,941 --> 01:27:10,352
Yes, we're all the same.
We're all equal.

1371
01:27:10,443 --> 01:27:14,321
That we have never been
just a collection of individuals...

1372
01:27:14,411 --> 01:27:17,582
or a collection of red states
and blue states.

1373
01:27:17,678 --> 01:27:22,283
We are and always will be
the United States of America.

1374
01:27:22,380 --> 01:27:23,947
Next he'll be telling us
we're a community,

1375
01:27:24,212 --> 01:27:25,586
we're one people.

1376
01:27:26,245 --> 01:27:29,521
In this country,
we rise or fall as one nation,

1377
01:27:29,614 --> 01:27:31,592
as one people.

1378
01:27:32,414 --> 01:27:34,325
Had yourself quite a party.

1379
01:27:34,782 --> 01:27:37,420
I do the best I can. Beer.

1380
01:27:37,517 --> 01:27:42,392
So everything is under control,
I take it, at long last?

1381
01:27:43,782 --> 01:27:45,489
For someone I'm trying to
help out and everything...

1382
01:27:45,584 --> 01:27:47,618
you're awful hard to get along with.

1383
01:27:47,716 --> 01:27:48,956
Could have made you drive up
to see me, you know...

1384
01:27:49,217 --> 01:27:51,162
I didn't have to come down here.

1385
01:27:51,252 --> 01:27:52,854
Trying to be nice to you.

1386
01:27:52,951 --> 01:27:54,726
You're trying to be nice to me?

1387
01:27:54,820 --> 01:27:58,230
Sure, I'm a nice guy.
I like to make things easy on people...

1388
01:27:58,320 --> 01:27:59,888
do people favors now and then.

1389
01:28:00,453 --> 01:28:02,830
Do me a favor, don't do me any favors.

1390
01:28:02,921 --> 01:28:04,454
I see how you work.

1391
01:28:04,553 --> 01:28:06,794
Tell you what, just give me the money.

1392
01:28:10,656 --> 01:28:11,827
Excuse me.

1393
01:28:11,923 --> 01:28:13,334
Are you gonna count it?

1394
01:28:13,725 --> 01:28:15,895
I gotta take a leak.
Leave me alone, all right?

1395
01:28:16,158 --> 01:28:18,193
Have another ginger ale,
for Christ's sake.

1396
01:28:18,291 --> 01:28:21,598
Beyond our shores,
parliaments and palaces...

1397
01:28:21,690 --> 01:28:23,396
those who are huddled around radios...

1398
01:28:23,491 --> 01:28:25,560
in the forgotten corners of the world...

1399
01:28:25,658 --> 01:28:26,864
our stories are singular,

1400
01:28:26,959 --> 01:28:29,165
but our destiny is shared.

1401
01:28:29,261 --> 01:28:31,296
Tonight we proved once more

1402
01:28:31,394 --> 01:28:33,235
that the true strength of our nation...

1403
01:28:33,327 --> 01:28:36,429
comes not from the might of our arms
or the scale of our wealth...

1404
01:28:36,527 --> 01:28:38,938
but from the enduring power
of our ideals...

1405
01:28:39,195 --> 01:28:43,936
democracy, liberty,
opportunity and unyielding hope.

1406
01:28:47,530 --> 01:28:51,704
Yes, we can! Yes, we can! Yes we can!

1407
01:28:51,798 --> 01:28:56,468
Yes, we can! Yes, we can! Yes we can!

1408
01:28:59,398 --> 01:29:00,741
Feel better?

1409
01:29:00,833 --> 01:29:03,573
No. There's only 30 in there.

1410
01:29:04,768 --> 01:29:05,837
Three guys.

1411
01:29:05,902 --> 01:29:07,970
Yeah, I had to ask them
if I should pay you for the kid.

1412
01:29:08,234 --> 01:29:10,270
But, you know, they said I should, so.

1413
01:29:10,369 --> 01:29:13,208
They were right too.
That's only ten apiece.

1414
01:29:13,300 --> 01:29:14,335
Correct.

1415
01:29:14,434 --> 01:29:15,844
The price is 15.

1416
01:29:15,935 --> 01:29:18,674
Dillon charges 10.

1417
01:29:18,768 --> 01:29:21,714
Recession prices.
They told me to tell you that too.

1418
01:29:22,704 --> 01:29:25,273
I made a deal with Mickey for 15.

1419
01:29:26,339 --> 01:29:28,875
Yeah, yeah, but the way they got it...

1420
01:29:28,974 --> 01:29:31,209
Mickey got in a fight with a whore,
the dumb shit...

1421
01:29:31,304 --> 01:29:33,978
and now they got him in the can
and you're filling in for Dillon...

1422
01:29:34,240 --> 01:29:37,547
and you get what Dillon gets, no more.

1423
01:29:40,474 --> 01:29:43,783
Talk to Dillon. Take it up with him.

1424
01:29:46,276 --> 01:29:47,778
Dillon's dead.

1425
01:29:49,208 --> 01:29:51,208
Dillon died this morning.

1426
01:29:57,978 --> 01:30:00,218
They're going to be
very sorry to hear that.

1427
01:30:00,313 --> 01:30:03,382
Sure, sure, they are.
it's gonna cost them more.

1428
01:30:05,315 --> 01:30:07,754
You know, this business
is a business of relationships.

1429
01:30:07,844 --> 01:30:10,483
Yeah, and everyone loved Markie.

1430
01:30:12,712 --> 01:30:15,522
You are cynical bastard, you know that?

1431
01:30:15,615 --> 01:30:17,252
To reclaim the American dream

1432
01:30:17,349 --> 01:30:20,816
and reaffirm that fundamental
truth that out of many,

1433
01:30:20,917 --> 01:30:21,895
we are one.

1434
01:30:21,984 --> 01:30:24,425
You hear that line? Line's for you.

1435
01:30:25,183 --> 01:30:27,925
Don't make me laugh. We're one people.

1436
01:30:28,186 --> 01:30:30,219
It's a myth created by Thomas Jefferson.

1437
01:30:30,317 --> 01:30:32,693
Oh, now you're gonna
have a go at Jefferson?

1438
01:30:32,784 --> 01:30:35,228
My friend,
Jefferson's an American saint...

1439
01:30:35,318 --> 01:30:36,296
because he wrote the words,

1440
01:30:36,386 --> 01:30:38,366
“All men are created equal“...

1441
01:30:38,454 --> 01:30:39,624
words he clearly didn't believe,

1442
01:30:39,720 --> 01:30:42,696
since he allowed his own
children to live in slavery.

1443
01:30:42,785 --> 01:30:44,230
He was a rich wine snob who was sick

1444
01:30:44,320 --> 01:30:45,854
of paying taxes to the Brits...

1445
01:30:45,986 --> 01:30:48,227
so, yeah, he wrote some lovely
words and aroused the rabble...

1446
01:30:48,322 --> 01:30:49,960
and they went out
and died for those words...

1447
01:30:50,224 --> 01:30:51,859
while he sat back and drank his wine

1448
01:30:51,956 --> 01:30:53,798
and fucked his slave girl.

1449
01:30:54,991 --> 01:30:57,593
This guy wants to tell me
we're living in a community.

1450
01:30:57,690 --> 01:30:59,601
Don't make me laugh.

1451
01:31:00,490 --> 01:31:01,899
I'm living in America,

1452
01:31:01,989 --> 01:31:03,967
and in America, you're on your own.

1453
01:31:04,757 --> 01:31:08,396
Americas not a country.
it's just a business.

1454
01:31:09,226 --> 01:31:10,933
Now fucking pay me.
