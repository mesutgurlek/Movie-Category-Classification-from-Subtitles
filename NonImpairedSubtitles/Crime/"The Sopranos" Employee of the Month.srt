I'm sure it was too much for you then
too. That's why you short-circuited.

516
00:40:55,851 --> 00:41:01,209
Puberty. Witnessing not only your
mother and father's sexuality...

517
00:41:01,411 --> 00:41:05,609
...but also the violence and blood
so closely connected...

...to the food you were about to eat.

519

Remembrance of Things Past.

He took a bite of a madeleine.

526
00:41:34,451 --> 00:41:38,569
It's a kind of tea cookie
he used to have as a child.

527
00:41:38,771 --> 00:41:43,925
And that one bite unleashed a tide
of memories of his childhood...

That's why he's been so adamant.

You're the one who told

of your background...

somehow damages your self-esteem?

I felt safe for the first time.

1215
01:37:10,257 --> 01:37:12,054
Empowered.

1216
01:37:13,857 --> 01:37:15,495
The vending machine?

1217
01:37:15,737 --> 01:37:18,968
My guilt for putting myself
in harm's way.

1218
01:37:19,217 --> 01:37:22,368
I read about that too,
that honeymooner...

1219
01:37:22,617 --> 01:37:26,974
...who rocked a vending machine
and it fell on him and killed him.

1220
01:37:27,937 --> 01:37:31,896
The dog though, I don't know.

1221
01:37:32,137 --> 01:37:37,336
The forbidden part of your psyche,
murderous rage.

1222
01:37:37,737 --> 01:37:41,127
Yeah, but at first I thought
he was after me.

1223
01:37:41,537 --> 01:37:44,370
The door said, "Danger."

1224
01:37:44,577 --> 01:37:49,776
Actually, no, it said, "High Voltage.
Call NJGE Before Digging."

1225
01:37:50,657 --> 01:37:52,852
"Jersey Gas and Electric."

1226
01:37:53,097 --> 01:37:57,648
- Was Richard anywhere in all this?
- No.

1227
01:37:58,417 --> 01:38:00,772
Oh, my God. The dog.

1228
01:38:01,017 --> 01:38:03,167
- What?
- A rottweiler, Elliot.

1229
01:38:03,377 --> 01:38:06,050
Big head. Massive shoulders.

1230
01:38:06,297 --> 01:38:11,007
Descendent of the dog used by
the Roman armies to guard their camps.

1231
01:38:11,217 --> 01:38:13,094
- I didn't know that.
- Digging?

1232
01:38:13,297 --> 01:38:16,687
Who do I dig with?
And who's dangerous?

1233
01:38:16,897 --> 01:38:22,096
Who could I sic on that son of a bitch
to tear him to shreds?

1234
01:38:23,857 --> 01:38:26,690
- Oh.
- Let me tell you something.

1235
01:38:26,937 --> 01:38:32,136
No feeling has ever been so sweet
as to see that pig beg...

1236
01:38:32,537 --> 01:38:34,687
...and plead and scream for life.

1237
01:38:34,937 --> 01:38:39,488
Because the justice system
is fucked up, Elliot.

1238
01:38:39,737 --> 01:38:43,286
Richard's attorney is
in this at $300 an hour.

1239
01:38:43,537 --> 01:38:47,052
Meanwhile, that
employee of the month cocksucker...

1240
01:38:47,257 --> 01:38:51,853
...is back on the street,
and who's gonna stop him? You?

1241
01:38:52,937 --> 01:38:54,848
Jennifer...

1242
01:38:56,537 --> 01:39:00,576
- Civilization...
- Don't worry.

1243
01:39:00,817 --> 01:39:03,809
I'm not going to break
the social compact.

1244
01:39:04,337 --> 01:39:08,888
But that's not saying there's not a
certain satisfaction in knowing...

1245
01:39:09,097 --> 01:39:13,488
...that I could have that asshole
squashed like a bug.

1246
01:39:13,737 --> 01:39:15,216
If I wanted.

1247
01:39:26,017 --> 01:39:28,053
What happened?

1248
01:39:30,457 --> 01:39:32,129
Janice?

1249
01:39:34,137 --> 01:39:38,176
I can't drive.
And they broke three ribs.

1250
01:39:38,377 --> 01:39:43,576
What did I tell you? I told you
not to mess with those people.

1251
01:39:43,817 --> 01:39:46,809
I was supposed to be married
at this point.

1252
01:39:47,017 --> 01:39:49,690
- Yeah? So?
- The man I loved died.

1253
01:39:49,897 --> 01:39:51,535
[RATTLING]

1254
01:39:55,537 --> 01:39:59,246
This is all I fucking need.
Thanks, Janice.

1255
01:40:00,177 --> 01:40:01,735
- What?
- What do you mean?

1256
01:40:01,937 --> 01:40:04,167
- They slapped my sister around.
- Oh.

1257
01:40:04,377 --> 01:40:07,449
I have to get payback.
It's always something.

1258
01:40:07,657 --> 01:40:11,445
Every time I hear your voice,
I know it's gonna cost me.

1259
01:40:11,657 --> 01:40:16,333
Time. Money. You never do anything
to simplify my life.

1260
01:40:16,537 --> 01:40:22,487
I stole a woman's prosthetic leg.
When did I get like this?

1261
01:40:22,697 --> 01:40:26,292
- You really wanna know?
- When Richie died.

1262
01:40:26,497 --> 01:40:30,854
Till that time, I was functioning
at a very high level.

1263
01:40:32,657 --> 01:40:35,376
There's only one trajectory for me.

1264
01:40:36,537 --> 01:40:38,050
Really?

1265
01:40:38,857 --> 01:40:42,645
- God.
- You see what I mean?

1266
01:40:42,857 --> 01:40:46,293
All this soul-searching,
it's always on my dime.

1267
01:40:46,497 --> 01:40:49,250
I've hit bottom, Tony.

1268
01:40:50,337 --> 01:40:55,536
But it's odd because
I feel born again in the Lord.

1269
01:40:57,697 --> 01:41:02,248
- Hm.
- And I prayed to God and I asked him...

1270
01:41:02,457 --> 01:41:07,247
...to forgive Svetlana
for what she's done.

1271
01:41:08,257 --> 01:41:13,126
We've been here before. With Vishnu
and Richard-fucking-Alpert...

1272
01:41:13,337 --> 01:41:17,091
...and the Coyote Spirit.
You know what it always spells?

1273
01:41:17,337 --> 01:41:21,967
Trouble for the rest of us.
So put your fucking clothes on.

1274
01:41:22,217 --> 01:41:25,368
Seriously. I gotta get out of here.

1275
01:41:25,617 --> 01:41:30,816
I give myself up utterly
and totally to God.

1276
01:41:31,657 --> 01:41:34,046
If this is the bottom.

1277
01:41:34,257 --> 01:41:35,485
If not...

1278
01:41:36,497 --> 01:41:37,646
You can go now.

1279
01:41:37,857 --> 01:41:41,088
Billing needs to see you.
Follow the blue line.

1280
01:41:52,657 --> 01:41:54,648
Carmela.

1281
01:41:55,737 --> 01:41:58,456
- Gorgeous as ever.
- My God, this house.

1282
01:41:58,697 --> 01:41:59,812
You got one.

1283
01:42:03,097 --> 01:42:07,329
Move to Jersey, but maybe take
a little bit of a halfway step?

1284
01:42:07,537 --> 01:42:10,051
Fucking wife of mine.

1285
01:42:16,177 --> 01:42:17,496
Gentlemen.

1286
01:42:17,737 --> 01:42:22,288
"What we do in life
echoes in eternity."

1287
01:42:22,497 --> 01:42:24,613
He's obsessed with Gladiator.

1288
01:42:24,817 --> 01:42:29,493
Come on, it's a great fucking film.
"Strength and honor."

1289
01:42:29,737 --> 01:42:33,696
Scotch and soda. Long as you're
on the way to the bar.

1290
01:42:33,937 --> 01:42:35,290
Ball breaker.

1291
01:42:35,537 --> 01:42:37,368
J & B, right, Ton?

1292
01:42:37,617 --> 01:42:40,654
T, what do you think
a place like this...

1293
01:42:40,857 --> 01:42:43,530
...set John back?
- Who gives a shit?

1294
01:42:43,737 --> 01:42:46,410
Landscape alone's gotta be
100, 150 G's.

1295
01:42:46,617 --> 01:42:50,246
- To keep up this lawn...
- Property taxes. Gotta pay those.

1296
01:42:50,457 --> 01:42:51,446
SILVIO:
Taxes.

1297
01:42:51,657 --> 01:42:54,569
Use the money to
fix air traffic control?

1298
01:42:54,817 --> 01:42:56,614
GIGl:
We should fight terrorism.

1299
01:42:56,817 --> 01:43:00,446
How about that stampede in
Zimbabwe? Soccer game.

1300
01:43:00,657 --> 01:43:04,252
GIGl:
No assigned seating. Always a problem.

1301
01:43:20,137 --> 01:43:23,447
You're not using the cane anymore.

1302
01:43:29,697 --> 01:43:34,646
Been making my list.

1303
01:43:35,537 --> 01:43:40,452
Even bought a little notebook.

1304
01:43:41,097 --> 01:43:43,657
Good. That's good.

1305
01:43:44,977 --> 01:43:50,005
I've been thinking about your behavior
therapy idea. You got a point.

1306
01:43:50,457 --> 01:43:55,167
I could use some help with a few
things. If they can help me there...

1307
01:43:55,377 --> 01:43:56,969
...I should go there.

1308
01:43:57,177 --> 01:43:58,166
No.

1309
01:43:58,617 --> 01:44:02,496
You sure about that?
Because the last couple of times...

1310
01:44:02,737 --> 01:44:07,253
...I've been getting the feeling
that you're giving me the boot.

1311
01:44:17,417 --> 01:44:19,248
What's the matter?

1312
01:44:19,457 --> 01:44:21,652
Hey, come on.

1313
01:44:21,857 --> 01:44:23,848
What did I do?

1314
01:44:24,057 --> 01:44:26,252
Come on, huh?

1315
01:44:26,617 --> 01:44:28,812
Hey. Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

1316
01:44:28,977 --> 01:44:30,854
Come on.

1317
01:44:32,657 --> 01:44:36,570
Now, what did I do? What's the matter?

1318
01:44:36,817 --> 01:44:38,887
Tell me. What's the matter?

1319
01:44:39,137 --> 01:44:40,775
Go sit over there.

1320
01:44:41,017 --> 01:44:43,531
We'll do this.

1321
01:44:43,737 --> 01:44:45,250
Go.

1322
01:44:47,137 --> 01:44:50,846
It's just my knee.

1323
01:45:01,857 --> 01:45:04,246
It's okay. Go on.

1324
01:45:07,137 --> 01:45:08,650
What?

1325
01:45:09,657 --> 01:45:12,649
I mean, you wanna say something?

1326
01:45:19,497 --> 01:45:20,646
No.
