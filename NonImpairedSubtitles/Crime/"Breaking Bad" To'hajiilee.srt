2
00:00:07,396 --> 00:00:09,113
So, how big's the batch?

3
00:00:09,148 --> 00:00:11,098
Should be about 50 pounds,
give or take.

4
00:00:11,116 --> 00:00:13,034
Uncle Jack, that mask...

5
00:00:13,068 --> 00:00:15,319
I think you should...

6
00:00:15,370 --> 00:00:18,623
Mr. White says the fumes
aren't good to breathe.

7
00:00:18,657 --> 00:00:20,458
Let me worry about
what I breathe, kid.

8
00:00:20,492 --> 00:00:22,943
Just hurry this up
so I can grab a smoke.

9
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:04,168
76%.

10
00:01:04,203 --> 00:01:06,170
- Nice going, nephew.
- Thanks, Uncle Jack.

11
00:01:06,205 --> 00:01:07,655
Where is the blue?

12
00:01:07,673 --> 00:01:09,156
Where's the what?

13
00:01:09,174 --> 00:01:10,658
The blue color.

14
00:01:10,676 --> 00:01:13,294
Does it come later,
when this hardens?

15
00:01:13,328 --> 00:01:15,329
Where is it?

16
00:01:16,381 --> 00:01:20,101
I am correct in assuming
this should be blue?

17
00:01:20,135 --> 00:01:23,104
See, I'm thinking the headline
here should be "76%."

18
00:01:23,138 --> 00:01:25,356
Yeah. Whole lot more
than it was.

19
00:01:25,390 --> 00:01:28,142
That dude who looked like Wolverine...
he couldn't crack 70.

20
00:01:28,176 --> 00:01:29,527
Fine. Yes,

21
00:01:29,561 --> 00:01:32,647
percentage-wise,
it's marginally improved.

22
00:01:32,681 --> 00:01:34,315
And congratulations, Todd.

23
00:01:34,349 --> 00:01:37,017
But blue is our brand.
All over Europe,

24
00:01:37,035 --> 00:01:39,570
it's what our buyers
pay top dollar for.

25
00:01:39,621 --> 00:01:42,240
If we're down a bit in purity
from the Heisenberg days,

26
00:01:42,291 --> 00:01:44,242
maybe they'll let us
slide on that,

27
00:01:44,293 --> 00:01:46,661
but not if it's not blue.

28
00:01:49,381 --> 00:01:50,831
I don't know.
To my eye,

29
00:01:50,865 --> 00:01:52,500
it's kind of blue.

30
00:01:52,534 --> 00:01:54,001
Yeah, a little.

31
00:01:54,035 --> 00:01:55,803
It's blue-ish.

32
00:01:58,423 --> 00:02:01,175
Todd, you're the chef.
What do you think?

33
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:08,566
Yeah, kinda...

34
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:10,601
If it catches the light
just right,

35
00:02:10,652 --> 00:02:13,571
I could see how you'd think

36
00:02:13,605 --> 00:02:15,556
there's a touch of blue,

37
00:02:15,574 --> 00:02:17,825
blue-green in there.

38
00:02:17,859 --> 00:02:19,226
Aquamarine.

39
00:02:19,244 --> 00:02:20,728
Hell, we'll put
food coloring in it.

40
00:02:20,746 --> 00:02:22,363
Make it any damn shade you want.

41
00:02:22,397 --> 00:02:24,732
- Yeah. Like they do farm-raised salmon.
- Yeah.

42
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:28,031
Jesus, you ever see how pink
they make that crap?

43
00:02:28,066 --> 00:02:30,001
Like, flamingo pink.

44
00:02:31,001 --> 00:02:33,321
It sure as hell don't come
out the ocean lookin' like that.

45
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:39,380
All right.
Let's make some money.

46
00:02:51,593 --> 00:02:55,229
- Here you go, Ms. Quayle.
- Lydia.

47
00:02:55,263 --> 00:02:57,097
Thank you.

48
00:03:03,238 --> 00:03:05,739
Is the tea okay?
I made it just like you asked.

49
00:03:05,774 --> 00:03:06,807
Mm-hmm.

50
00:03:06,825 --> 00:03:08,809
You sure?
If it's too weak or something,

51
00:03:08,827 --> 00:03:10,945
I can go put another bag in it.

52
00:03:10,979 --> 00:03:12,913
I'm sure.

53
00:03:14,916 --> 00:03:17,535
Look, about the product...

54
00:03:17,586 --> 00:03:20,171
I'm really sorry about the color.

55
00:03:20,205 --> 00:03:23,156
For a minute or two,
it just got a few degrees too hot

56
00:03:23,175 --> 00:03:25,092
in the mixing kettle, I think.

57
00:03:25,126 --> 00:03:28,179
I might've just cooked the
color right out of it.

58
00:03:28,213 --> 00:03:31,465
You burned it, like a cake.

59
00:03:33,351 --> 00:03:35,603
Yeah, sort of, I guess.

60
00:03:35,637 --> 00:03:37,605
But the point is
I think I can fix it,

61
00:03:37,639 --> 00:03:41,108
and I think I can bring
the purity up too.

62
00:03:41,142 --> 00:03:43,176
I mean, I'm doing everything

63
00:03:43,195 --> 00:03:46,397
just like Mr. White
taught me, so...

64
00:03:46,448 --> 00:03:49,984
You know,
it's bound to get better, right?

65
00:03:50,018 --> 00:03:52,620
I appreciate you making
every possible effort,

66
00:03:52,654 --> 00:03:54,121
because, as you know,

67
00:03:54,155 --> 00:03:56,690
my buyers expect
a certain threshold,

68
00:03:56,708 --> 00:03:58,125
a continuity.

69
00:03:58,159 --> 00:04:00,377
Yeah. Yeah. Totally.

70
00:04:07,035 --> 00:04:08,535
Uh, about your buyers...

71
00:04:10,038 --> 00:04:13,974
I could ask my uncle
to smooth things over with them,

72
00:04:14,976 --> 00:04:18,562
if... you want.

73
00:04:20,649 --> 00:04:24,184
I'll pass. Thanks.

74
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:27,988
I've put a lot of faith
in your abilities, Todd.

75
00:04:28,023 --> 00:04:30,891
I believe in you.

76
00:04:30,909 --> 00:04:33,727
Please do make the cook better.

77
00:04:33,745 --> 00:04:36,497
It's very important to me.

78
00:04:41,453 --> 00:04:43,837
I've got a flight to catch.

79
00:05:14,452 --> 00:05:15,486
Hello.

80
00:05:15,537 --> 00:05:17,488
<i>Hey. It's Walt.</i>

81
00:05:17,539 --> 00:05:19,156
Hey, Mr. White.
How you doing?

82
00:05:19,207 --> 00:05:20,708
<i>I'm okay.</i>

83
00:05:20,742 --> 00:05:22,459
<i>I, uh...</i>

84
00:05:22,494 --> 00:05:25,462
<i>Todd, I think I might have</i>

85
00:05:25,497 --> 00:05:27,498
<i>another job for your uncle.</i>

86
00:05:27,549 --> 00:05:30,551
Oh, okay. Uh, you want me
to set up a meeting?

87
00:05:30,585 --> 00:05:33,887
<i>I... Yes. Please.
Let's do that.</i>

88
00:05:33,922 --> 00:05:37,308
Any heads-up
I should give him, like, um,

89
00:05:37,342 --> 00:05:40,961
which jail, how many targets,
stuff like that?

90
00:05:42,897 --> 00:05:44,848
<i>- Mr. White?
- Just one target.</i>

91
00:05:44,899 --> 00:05:47,518
<i>Not currently in jail.</i>

92
00:05:47,569 --> 00:05:49,653
<i>Jesse Pinkman.</i>

93
00:05:49,688 --> 00:05:52,323
You got it.

95
00:06:48,349 --> 00:06:50,258
I'm surprised
you didn't strangle him.

96
00:06:50,351 --> 00:06:52,219
So, now what? Book him?

97
00:06:52,237 --> 00:06:55,388
I'm sure the AUSA have plenty to say
on how to play him against Walt.

98
00:06:55,406 --> 00:06:58,525
Knowing what we know about how
Walt deals with rats behind bars? No...

99
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:00,727
Yeah. Punk has to be safer
with the Marshals watching his back

100
00:07:00,745 --> 00:07:03,139
than out here
where it's open season.

101
00:07:03,140 --> 00:07:04,635
Mmmh...

102
00:07:04,670 --> 00:07:06,350
What does that mean?
What are you thinking?

103
00:07:07,180 --> 00:07:08,835
Kid's got an idea.

104
00:07:08,870 --> 00:07:11,255
What kid? That kid?
Timmy Dipshit there?

105
00:07:11,289 --> 00:07:13,924
The one that screwed up our sting?
Oh, I'm all ears.

106
00:07:13,958 --> 00:07:16,243
Just, uh, hear him out, will ya?

107
00:07:23,718 --> 00:07:26,436
Okay, genius, what's the idea?

108
00:07:26,471 --> 00:07:29,439
You guys need evidence
to put him away,

109
00:07:29,474 --> 00:07:32,276
only he's too smart
to leave any out there, right?

110
00:07:32,310 --> 00:07:33,777
So you say.

111
00:07:33,811 --> 00:07:35,779
Well, I know some evidence

112
00:07:35,813 --> 00:07:38,365
that greedy asshole
would never destroy.

113
00:07:39,433 --> 00:07:41,401
His money.

114
00:07:41,435 --> 00:07:43,770
- You know where he keeps his money?
- No.

115
00:07:43,788 --> 00:07:46,573
But I know someone who might.

116
00:07:52,580 --> 00:07:54,414
Oh, hey.
How'd it go?

117
00:07:54,448 --> 00:07:57,551
Trailed him out to the dog house,
picked him up there.

118
00:07:57,585 --> 00:07:59,753
Seemed to be looking for someone.

119
00:07:59,787 --> 00:08:01,255
Had a lot of questions.

120
00:08:01,289 --> 00:08:03,257
No calls, though, right?
You got his phone?

121
00:08:03,291 --> 00:08:04,508
Yeah.

122
00:08:06,678 --> 00:08:08,312
He's on ice?

123
00:08:08,346 --> 00:08:10,130
The safe house off Rio Bravo.

124
00:08:10,148 --> 00:08:12,232
I got Van Oster babysitting him.

125
00:08:12,267 --> 00:08:15,468
Yeah, and what about Van Oster?
Did he have any questions?

126
00:08:15,486 --> 00:08:17,938
Probably, but he knows better
than to ask.

127
00:08:17,972 --> 00:08:19,273
Good job.

128
00:08:19,307 --> 00:08:21,408
I gotta tell you this
up front, Hank.

129
00:08:21,442 --> 00:08:23,660
If this guy decides
that he wants to lawyer up,

130
00:08:23,695 --> 00:08:25,329
I don't care if you are my boss,

131
00:08:25,363 --> 00:08:27,364
I'm gonna put a stop to this.

132
00:08:27,415 --> 00:08:29,416
He won't lawyer up.

133
00:08:44,465 --> 00:08:46,133
What the hell, man?

134
00:08:47,685 --> 00:08:49,019
Ugh.

135
00:09:07,572 --> 00:09:09,039
You're up.

136
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:21,134
Hey, there. You mind taking it
outside for a minute?

137
00:09:21,169 --> 00:09:23,503
- No, sir. You got it.
- All right. Thanks.

138
00:09:24,538 --> 00:09:26,706
Huell Babineaux.

139
00:09:28,142 --> 00:09:30,143
Know who I am?

140
00:09:31,512 --> 00:09:33,480
I'll take that as a yes.

141
00:09:33,514 --> 00:09:35,732
Uh, thanks for your patience.

142
00:09:35,767 --> 00:09:38,735
Uh, as, uh, Agent Gomez said,

143
00:09:38,770 --> 00:09:41,104
you're... you're not
under arrest.

144
00:09:41,155 --> 00:09:42,773
Why am I here?

145
00:09:42,824 --> 00:09:45,909
Well, you're here, uh,
for your own protection, sir.

146
00:09:45,943 --> 00:09:47,411
How you figure that?

147
00:09:47,445 --> 00:09:51,164
Well, we both know how dangerous
my brother-in-law can be.

148
00:09:55,586 --> 00:09:57,504
Nice poker face.

149
00:09:57,538 --> 00:09:59,423
Look, uh, relax.

150
00:09:59,457 --> 00:10:02,075
There's not much new you can
tell me about Walter White.

151
00:10:02,093 --> 00:10:04,077
Multiple murders,

152
00:10:04,095 --> 00:10:06,413
uh, ties to a white power
prison gang,

153
00:10:06,431 --> 00:10:09,099
ran the largest meth racket
in the entire Southwest.

154
00:10:09,133 --> 00:10:11,802
I'm not asking,
you're not answering.

155
00:10:11,853 --> 00:10:13,970
Whoop-de-doo.
Let's cut to the chase.

156
00:10:14,021 --> 00:10:16,022
We have a wire on Walt's phone.

157
00:10:16,057 --> 00:10:18,258
We intercepted a call between him

158
00:10:18,276 --> 00:10:20,944
and a certain Saul Goodman,
esquire.

159
00:10:20,978 --> 00:10:23,613
You know, your employer.

160
00:10:23,648 --> 00:10:26,700
Anyway, in the call, uh, Walt said
that he was going to, quote,

161
00:10:26,734 --> 00:10:29,369
"Take care of one Jesse Pinkman,"
unquote,

162
00:10:29,404 --> 00:10:31,288
and that you were next
on the hit list.

163
00:10:31,322 --> 00:10:32,622
That's why you're here.

164
00:10:32,657 --> 00:10:34,908
Bullshit.
That don't make no sense.

165
00:10:34,942 --> 00:10:37,444
We got the recording.
I can... I can let you hear it.

166
00:10:37,462 --> 00:10:40,080
Your associate, Goodman's fixer...
What's his name?

167
00:10:40,114 --> 00:10:42,382
Some carrottop
named Patrick Kuby.

168
00:10:42,417 --> 00:10:45,051
Boston PD ran him out of
Beantown a few years back.

169
00:10:45,086 --> 00:10:46,619
Came out here for the sunshine.

170
00:10:46,637 --> 00:10:49,890
Yeah. Walt said he was gonna do this
Kuby guy the same way he does you.

171
00:10:49,924 --> 00:10:52,092
In fact, Kuby's already missing.

172
00:10:52,126 --> 00:10:54,094
Sorry to say,
things are looking grim

173
00:10:54,128 --> 00:10:55,962
for your...
your redheaded buddy.

174
00:10:55,980 --> 00:10:59,466
Believe us, don't believe us.
Suit yourself.

175
00:10:59,484 --> 00:11:01,985
Whatever you do,
I would not call Goodman.

176
00:11:02,019 --> 00:11:03,970
He sold you
down the river big-time.

177
00:11:03,988 --> 00:11:06,907
- The hell you talkin' about?
- Oh, don't take it personally.

178
00:11:06,941 --> 00:11:09,809
Goodman's next on the chopping block
if he doesn't do what White says.

179
00:11:09,827 --> 00:11:12,145
And to be fair,
your, uh, circus clown of a boss

180
00:11:12,163 --> 00:11:14,164
did try to spare you
for all of, what,

181
00:11:14,198 --> 00:11:16,166
about 15 seconds

182
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:18,151
Before he decided
to help Walt track you down.

183
00:11:18,169 --> 00:11:21,154
You see, Goodman's got
a trace on your phone,

184
00:11:21,172 --> 00:11:22,822
and as soon as you call him,

185
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:24,824
uh, Walt's gonna find out
where you're hiding out.

186
00:11:24,842 --> 00:11:27,362
And then it's just a matter of time
before you end up like this.

187
00:11:29,297 --> 00:11:31,798
Oh, man. Oh, man.

188
00:11:31,832 --> 00:11:34,384
I swear to God, I didn't know
he was gonna kill the man.

189
00:11:34,435 --> 00:11:36,470
I didn't know he was gonna kill him.
I didn't know.

190
00:11:36,504 --> 00:11:38,004
- Relax.
- I didn't know he was gonna kill him.

191
00:11:38,022 --> 00:11:39,523
If we thought you did,
you'd be in lockup

192
00:11:39,557 --> 00:11:41,057
for conspiracy to commit murder

193
00:11:41,108 --> 00:11:42,642
instead of here,
under our protection.

194
00:11:42,676 --> 00:11:44,644
So just tell us everything
you know about White

195
00:11:44,678 --> 00:11:46,146
so we can get him
before he gets you.

196
00:11:46,180 --> 00:11:48,148
Why would he wanna kill me?

197
00:11:48,182 --> 00:11:50,484
- I ain't do nothin' to him.
- Who knows with this guy?

198
00:11:50,518 --> 00:11:52,619
From what he said to Goodman,
it may have something to do

199
00:11:52,653 --> 00:11:54,287
with him trying
to tie up loose ends

200
00:11:54,322 --> 00:11:56,990
regarding his poisoning
some kid named Brock.

201
00:11:58,326 --> 00:12:01,211
Or maybe it's 'cause you know
where his money is.

202
00:12:01,245 --> 00:12:03,163
I don't know where his money is.

203
00:12:03,197 --> 00:12:04,664
That ain't what we heard.

204
00:12:04,698 --> 00:12:07,000
Well, you ain't listening
to the people in the know.

205
00:12:07,034 --> 00:12:09,135
Me and Kuby
rented a van for the dude,

206
00:12:09,170 --> 00:12:12,005
loaded his cash up
in a self-storage unit,

207
00:12:12,039 --> 00:12:14,707
handed over the keys
to him at Goodman's.

208
00:12:14,725 --> 00:12:17,060
And who knows
where he took it from there?

209
00:12:17,094 --> 00:12:19,879
A van, huh?
How much money we talking?

210
00:12:19,897 --> 00:12:22,065
Seven barrels' worth.

211
00:12:22,099 --> 00:12:23,650
Seven barrels?

212
00:12:25,386 --> 00:12:27,404
When you...
you say "barrels,"

213
00:12:27,438 --> 00:12:29,406
<i>you mean barrels barrels?</i>

214
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:31,274
Barrels, man.
You know,

215
00:12:31,325 --> 00:12:34,661
plastic, black,
55-gallon type.

216
00:12:34,695 --> 00:12:36,162
I got 'em at Home Depot.

217
00:12:36,197 --> 00:12:38,832
Filled up every last damn
one of 'em too.

218
00:12:39,834 --> 00:12:42,085
And, uh, where did you
rent the van?

219
00:12:42,119 --> 00:12:43,537
Lariat.

220
00:12:43,571 --> 00:12:46,072
The one on Candelaria and Monroe.

221
00:12:48,042 --> 00:12:50,910
- Lariat on Candelaria?
- Yeah!

222
00:12:50,928 --> 00:12:52,912
Kuby rented the van.

223
00:12:52,930 --> 00:12:54,631
Mr. White dropped it off.

224
00:12:54,682 --> 00:12:57,100
He had us wash it good
before Kuby took it back.

225
00:12:57,134 --> 00:12:58,685
Wash the rental?
Why?

226
00:12:58,719 --> 00:13:01,521
It was filthy, man,
like he had went off road with it.

227
00:13:01,556 --> 00:13:04,774
After we had hosed it down,
he grabbed a shovel out the back,

228
00:13:04,809 --> 00:13:07,527
handed over the key,
and that was it.

229
00:13:07,562 --> 00:13:08,945
That's all I know.

230
00:13:12,266 --> 00:13:14,651
All right, uh, Mr. Babineaux.

231
00:13:15,653 --> 00:13:17,621
Agent Gomez and I

232
00:13:17,655 --> 00:13:20,290
are going to, uh,
do everything we can

233
00:13:20,324 --> 00:13:22,242
to find the son of a bitch.

234
00:13:22,276 --> 00:13:24,044
Meantime, like I said,
you're free to go.

235
00:13:24,078 --> 00:13:26,630
But if I were you,
I wouldn't take one step out that door.

236
00:13:26,664 --> 00:13:29,299
Right. And
remember, no phone calls.

237
00:13:29,333 --> 00:13:31,084
Oh, almost forgot.

238
00:13:31,118 --> 00:13:33,420
Uh, I took the liberty
of removing the battery

239
00:13:33,454 --> 00:13:35,722
so Walt can't, uh,
track you by GPS.

240
00:13:35,756 --> 00:13:38,642
So don't put that back in.

241
00:13:38,676 --> 00:13:40,927
Agent Van Oster
will stay here with you.

242
00:13:40,961 --> 00:13:43,313
You're in good hands.
He's our best man with a gun.

243
00:13:43,347 --> 00:13:45,632
Uh, however, don't discuss
the case with him,

244
00:13:45,650 --> 00:13:48,301
because the less
you distract him,

245
00:13:48,319 --> 00:13:50,987
the better he can protect you.

246
00:13:51,022 --> 00:13:53,156
How long you gonna be?

247
00:13:54,158 --> 00:13:56,443
As long as it takes
to keep you safe.

248
00:14:08,656 --> 00:14:11,091
So just one guy this time.

249
00:14:11,125 --> 00:14:13,376
Not even in lockup.

250
00:14:16,514 --> 00:14:19,299
Some former partner, Todd says?

251
00:14:21,552 --> 00:14:22,852
Yeah.

252
00:14:22,887 --> 00:14:25,138
So what are we talking,
rat patrol?

253
00:14:27,224 --> 00:14:28,942
"Rat p..."

254
00:14:29,944 --> 00:14:31,561
No, no.

255
00:14:31,612 --> 00:14:34,898
"Rat patrol"?
No. No, he's not a rat.

256
00:14:36,183 --> 00:14:38,184
He's just...

257
00:14:39,370 --> 00:14:42,238
He... he just...

258
00:14:42,289 --> 00:14:44,457
won't listen to reason.

259
00:14:44,492 --> 00:14:46,710
- Okay.
- He's just angry.

260
00:14:46,744 --> 00:14:48,495
He's not a rat.

261
00:14:48,529 --> 00:14:50,530
All right.

262
00:14:51,749 --> 00:14:54,000
Angry, non-rat.
Got it.

263
00:14:54,034 --> 00:14:55,752
How angry we talkin', by the way?

264
00:14:55,803 --> 00:14:57,704
Like, Hulk angry?

265
00:14:57,722 --> 00:15:02,676
Like, "Rambo James Bond
badass" individual?

266
00:15:06,731 --> 00:15:08,732
Not something
you'd do yourself, huh?

267
00:15:10,851 --> 00:15:12,852
Jesse is like family to me.

268
00:15:14,405 --> 00:15:17,223
Look, I want what you do
to be quick

269
00:15:17,241 --> 00:15:18,891
and painless.

270
00:15:18,909 --> 00:15:20,994
No suffering, no fear.

271
00:15:21,028 --> 00:15:24,164
Bullet to the back of the head.
Something he doesn't see coming.

272
00:15:24,198 --> 00:15:26,082
I respect that.

273
00:15:26,117 --> 00:15:27,784
There's too many savages
out there.

274
00:15:27,835 --> 00:15:29,736
Let's just talk about the money.

275
00:15:29,754 --> 00:15:31,921
No, we don't want your money.

276
00:15:33,541 --> 00:15:35,175
We want you to cook for us.

277
00:15:44,752 --> 00:15:47,971
You know I'm out of the business.

278
00:15:48,022 --> 00:15:50,724
Just a couple times
to tutor my nephew here, that's all.

279
00:15:50,758 --> 00:15:53,926
Get him on track
to bringing the purity up.

280
00:15:53,944 --> 00:15:56,596
Get the color right too.

281
00:15:56,614 --> 00:15:59,449
Apparently that blue touch
you put on it...

282
00:15:59,483 --> 00:16:01,901
it's all the craze
with those Slavic types.

283
00:16:01,935 --> 00:16:03,403
So I'm told.

284
00:16:03,488 --> 00:16:06,189
No. Absolutely not.

285
00:16:06,241 --> 00:16:10,110
Look, what was the price
per head last time? I'll triple it.

286
00:16:10,144 --> 00:16:13,614
That's a drop in the bucket compared to
what we aim to earn from the blue stuff.

287
00:16:13,648 --> 00:16:16,316
Don't skimp on family.
That's what I always say.

288
00:16:16,334 --> 00:16:18,035
You want us to do this job?

289
00:16:18,086 --> 00:16:21,038
Do it right?
That's the price.

290
00:16:33,167 --> 00:16:35,135
One cook...

291
00:16:35,169 --> 00:16:37,888
after the job is done.

292
00:16:56,857 --> 00:16:59,025
Time is of the essence.
Do you understand?

293
00:16:59,043 --> 00:17:01,378
We'll do him tonight if you want.

294
00:17:01,412 --> 00:17:03,413
Just tell me where he is.

295
00:17:03,464 --> 00:17:06,383
I don't know where he is,

296
00:17:07,835 --> 00:17:10,370
but I know how to flush him out.

297
00:17:14,395 --> 00:17:16,563
You want String Cheese
or Yogurt Squeezers

298
00:17:16,597 --> 00:17:18,065
with your PBJ?

299
00:17:18,099 --> 00:17:19,983
Both.

300
00:17:20,034 --> 00:17:22,986
- I didn't hear you.
- Both, please.

301
00:17:27,826 --> 00:17:29,543
Hold on, honey.

302
00:17:31,612 --> 00:17:33,247
Hi, Andrea.

303
00:17:33,281 --> 00:17:34,965
I don't know if you remember me.

304
00:17:34,999 --> 00:17:37,217
I'm Walter White, Jesse's friend.

305
00:17:37,252 --> 00:17:39,303
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, of course. Hi.

306
00:17:39,337 --> 00:17:40,804
Yeah. Oh, hi. Hi.

307
00:17:40,839 --> 00:17:43,841
I'm sorry to just barge in
on you like this,

308
00:17:43,892 --> 00:17:47,644
but, uh, I was hoping that I could
have a moment to talk with you.

309
00:17:47,679 --> 00:17:49,930
It's about Jesse.

310
00:17:49,964 --> 00:17:52,733
Um, okay. Sure. But I'm sort of
rushing around right now.

311
00:17:52,767 --> 00:17:54,768
You wanna talk inside while
I get my boy ready for school?

312
00:17:54,802 --> 00:17:56,436
Uh, well, yeah.
If it's...

313
00:17:56,470 --> 00:17:58,305
if it's okay, yeah, sure.

314
00:17:58,323 --> 00:18:00,307
Thank you.

315
00:18:00,325 --> 00:18:02,242
You met Brock before, right?

316
00:18:02,277 --> 00:18:05,195
Yes. Yes, I have.
At Jesse's.

317
00:18:05,246 --> 00:18:06,997
How you doing, Brock?

318
00:18:10,151 --> 00:18:11,885
Brock, he asked you a question.

319
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:14,621
- I'm good.
- Good.

320
00:18:14,656 --> 00:18:16,540
Froot Loops.

321
00:18:16,591 --> 00:18:18,926
That's good stuff.

322
00:18:20,211 --> 00:18:21,728
So... Jesse.

323
00:18:21,763 --> 00:18:23,230
Yeah. I...

324
00:18:23,264 --> 00:18:24,965
I don't wanna alarm you,

325
00:18:24,999 --> 00:18:27,634
but I've... I've been trying
to reach him for days.

326
00:18:27,668 --> 00:18:29,136
I've stopped at his house.

327
00:18:29,170 --> 00:18:31,738
I've left all kinds of messages
on his voice-mail,

328
00:18:31,773 --> 00:18:33,240
and he won't return my calls.

329
00:18:33,274 --> 00:18:35,058
I can't find him anywhere.

330
00:18:35,109 --> 00:18:37,010
Have you heard from him?

331
00:18:37,028 --> 00:18:39,512
No, not since the last time
he called to check on Brock.

332
00:18:39,531 --> 00:18:41,031
That was...
I don't know...

333
00:18:41,065 --> 00:18:43,116
two weeks ago, maybe.

334
00:18:44,118 --> 00:18:46,453
Andrea...

335
00:18:46,487 --> 00:18:49,022
Jesse's using again,

336
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:50,958
and I... I...

337
00:18:50,992 --> 00:18:53,410
I have a bad feeling about this.

338
00:18:55,246 --> 00:18:57,247
Have you tried
calling the police?

339
00:19:00,051 --> 00:19:01,835
Or, um...
a better idea.

340
00:19:01,869 --> 00:19:05,205
Jesse's lawyer's name is Saul Goodman.
I have his card somewhere.

341
00:19:05,223 --> 00:19:07,007
I mean, he may have ways
of finding Jesse

342
00:19:07,041 --> 00:19:08,725
without, you know,
getting him in trouble.

343
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:12,095
"Better Call Saul."
Yeah. I... I did that.

344
00:19:12,146 --> 00:19:14,598
He was able to verify
that Jesse's not locked up.

345
00:19:14,649 --> 00:19:18,819
But otherwise, very little help.

346
00:19:20,572 --> 00:19:22,356
See, the thing is

347
00:19:22,390 --> 00:19:25,609
is that Jesse and I
had this argument recently.

348
00:19:25,660 --> 00:19:29,079
And I... I won't bore you
with the details, but, uh,

349
00:19:29,113 --> 00:19:31,665
he's... he's...

350
00:19:31,699 --> 00:19:35,702
he's pretty upset
with me, and, uh...

351
00:19:35,736 --> 00:19:38,705
and I'm hoping that's the reason
he hasn't called me back

352
00:19:38,739 --> 00:19:40,507
instead of...

353
00:19:40,541 --> 00:19:43,260
him being...

354
00:19:43,294 --> 00:19:45,312
Well...

355
00:19:48,216 --> 00:19:50,250
Well, I'll try him right now.

356
00:19:50,268 --> 00:19:53,136
I mean, if that's it...
he's mad at you,

357
00:19:53,187 --> 00:19:54,805
maybe I'll have better luck.

358
00:19:54,856 --> 00:19:57,107
That would be such a help. Yes.

359
00:19:57,141 --> 00:20:00,260
What, um... what... what number
are you, uh, calling him on?

360
00:20:00,278 --> 00:20:02,446
- Um, his cell.
- Ah. Yeah. You know,

361
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:04,448
he recently gotten a new one.

362
00:20:04,482 --> 00:20:06,400
And there. That...

363
00:20:06,434 --> 00:20:09,536
that's his new number there...
the highlighted one.

364
00:20:14,309 --> 00:20:16,643
Jesse, hey, it's Andrea.

365
00:20:16,678 --> 00:20:18,145
Your friend Walter
just dropped by.

366
00:20:18,179 --> 00:20:20,180
He's here at the house
with me and Brock right now.

367
00:20:20,214 --> 00:20:22,716
We, uh...
we're thinking of you.

368
00:20:22,750 --> 00:20:24,951
Call me back as soon as
you get this message, okay?

369
00:20:24,969 --> 00:20:26,720
I really need to hear from you.

370
00:20:26,754 --> 00:20:28,805
It's important.

371
00:20:29,957 --> 00:20:32,125
Thank you, Andrea.

372
00:20:32,143 --> 00:20:34,845
I appreciate that.

373
00:20:34,896 --> 00:20:37,180
Well, I better...
I better be going.

374
00:20:37,231 --> 00:20:40,233
Oh, you're welcome to stay a
few minutes to see if he calls back.

375
00:20:40,268 --> 00:20:42,769
No. No, no. You're trying to
get your son off to school.

376
00:20:42,803 --> 00:20:45,188
Listen, if he does happen to
call back, would you call me?

377
00:20:45,239 --> 00:20:46,473
Better yet...

378
00:20:46,491 --> 00:20:49,526
I've got your number.
I'll call you back, okay?

379
00:20:49,577 --> 00:20:52,162
And... thank you.

380
00:20:53,164 --> 00:20:54,781
See ya, Brock.

381
00:21:24,529 --> 00:21:26,012
We on?

382
00:21:26,030 --> 00:21:28,782
Yes. It should be
any time now.

383
00:21:28,816 --> 00:21:30,701
<i>Copy that.</i>

384
00:21:30,735 --> 00:21:34,237
Remember, fast and painless.
And take him away from here.

385
00:21:34,288 --> 00:21:37,257
I don't want the mother
or the boy to know.

386
00:21:37,291 --> 00:21:39,126
<i>You got it.</i>

387
00:21:44,832 --> 00:21:46,833
<i>Jesse, hey, it's Andrea.</i>

388
00:21:46,867 --> 00:21:48,635
<i>Your friend Walter
just dropped by.</i>

389
00:21:48,669 --> 00:21:51,138
<i>He's here at the house
with me and Brock right now.</i>

390
00:21:51,172 --> 00:21:53,206
<i>We, uh...
we're thinking of you.</i>

391
00:21:53,224 --> 00:21:55,375
<i>Call me back as soon as
you get this message, okay?</i>

392
00:21:55,393 --> 00:21:57,177
<i>I really need to hear from you.</i>

393
00:21:57,211 --> 00:21:59,513
<i>It's important.</i>

394
00:22:02,266 --> 00:22:04,568
Nice try, asshole.

395
00:22:21,085 --> 00:22:23,003
How'd it go at the rental place?

396
00:22:23,037 --> 00:22:24,871
Van have GPS?

397
00:22:24,905 --> 00:22:26,706
No GPS. Nope.

398
00:22:26,740 --> 00:22:29,843
They used to have GPS
until about six months ago,

399
00:22:29,877 --> 00:22:32,429
when the ACLU
or somebody sued them,

400
00:22:32,463 --> 00:22:34,765
and they had to get rid of it.

401
00:22:38,820 --> 00:22:42,222
Well, that's it.
Game over.

402
00:22:42,256 --> 00:22:45,258
Yo, man, you can't
just give up on this.

403
00:22:45,276 --> 00:22:47,894
- Who said we're giving up?
- What do you got?

404
00:22:47,928 --> 00:22:50,263
Just thinking about
what Babineaux said

405
00:22:50,281 --> 00:22:51,764
about the van being dirty

406
00:22:51,783 --> 00:22:54,151
and the shovel
that Walt had with him.

407
00:22:54,202 --> 00:22:56,603
I'll bet you 10-to-1
he buried that money.

408
00:22:56,621 --> 00:22:58,822
No kidding.
So what?

409
00:22:58,873 --> 00:23:00,824
There's a whole lot
of desert out there.

410
00:23:00,875 --> 00:23:02,492
How are we gonna find
the right spot?

411
00:23:02,543 --> 00:23:04,944
You said it yourself,
there's no GPS on the van.

412
00:23:04,962 --> 00:23:08,498
Yeah. But Walt
doesn't know that.

413
00:23:12,425 --> 00:23:14,459
All right.

414
00:23:14,510 --> 00:23:16,795
Here's your change.

415
00:23:16,846 --> 00:23:18,797
- Oh, um, count it out, please.
- Here.

416
00:23:18,848 --> 00:23:20,915
Uh, three.
That makes 15.

417
00:23:20,933 --> 00:23:23,718
Plus five.
That is 20.

418
00:23:23,752 --> 00:23:25,887
Give this to
your car wash professional.

419
00:23:25,921 --> 00:23:27,222
Thank you.

420
00:23:27,256 --> 00:23:28,557
Say it.

421
00:23:28,591 --> 00:23:30,058
Have an A-1 day.

422
00:23:30,092 --> 00:23:31,759
Oh, you too.

423
00:23:32,761 --> 00:23:34,929
- Good.
- Why... why do I...

424
00:23:34,947 --> 00:23:36,898
why do I gotta say that?

425
00:23:36,932 --> 00:23:39,317
Because it reinforces our brand.

426
00:23:39,368 --> 00:23:41,403
So, getting the hang of it?

427
00:23:41,437 --> 00:23:44,456
It's, uh... it's...
it's pretty basic.

428
00:23:45,575 --> 00:23:47,442
Mom, it's Saturday.

429
00:23:47,660 --> 00:23:49,444
Can... can I go?

430
00:23:49,478 --> 00:23:51,145
- Go where?
- Home.

431
00:23:51,163 --> 00:23:54,616
Um, pick up a few things,
maybe chill for a little bit.

432
00:23:54,650 --> 00:23:56,835
I'm sure the smell
is gone by now.

433
00:23:56,869 --> 00:23:59,671
Why don't you just stick around here
for a while longer, all right?

434
00:23:59,705 --> 00:24:01,623
- I need you.
- Hi.

435
00:24:01,657 --> 00:24:03,758
Uh, who do I give this to?

436
00:24:03,793 --> 00:24:05,760
Um, you know what?
I'll take care of it.

437
00:24:05,795 --> 00:24:07,345
Excuse me, son.

438
00:24:07,379 --> 00:24:09,681
That'll be 14.97, please.

439
00:24:14,837 --> 00:24:16,805
Hey. How you doin'?

440
00:24:16,839 --> 00:24:19,808
Y-you're on our billboard.
You're...

441
00:24:19,842 --> 00:24:22,343
- you're the lawyer guy. Yeah.
- "Better call Saul!"

442
00:24:26,348 --> 00:24:28,733
Okay.

443
00:24:28,784 --> 00:24:33,655
So, three makes 15,
and 20, 25, 30,

444
00:24:33,689 --> 00:24:35,990
35, 40, and ten makes 50.

445
00:24:36,024 --> 00:24:37,325
Thank you.

446
00:24:37,359 --> 00:24:39,244
I like your commercial.

447
00:24:39,295 --> 00:24:40,962
What... what happened
to your face?

448
00:24:40,996 --> 00:24:44,165
Uh, this is a... I guess you'd call it
an occupational hazard.

449
00:24:44,199 --> 00:24:47,034
Okay, so thank you, and please give that
to your car wash professional.

450
00:24:47,052 --> 00:24:49,420
Very good. Thank you very much.
Good to meet you.

451
00:24:49,472 --> 00:24:51,222
- Yeah.
- Don't drink and drive.

452
00:24:51,257 --> 00:24:54,225
But if you do, call me.

453
00:24:54,260 --> 00:24:56,594
Have an A-1 day.

454
00:24:56,645 --> 00:24:58,880
Mom, you, um...
you forgot to say it.

455
00:24:58,898 --> 00:25:01,432
Yeah. Yeah, I did.
Okay.

456
00:25:02,935 --> 00:25:05,570
Make sure you get in there
between the cushions, all right?

457
00:25:05,604 --> 00:25:08,907
That's it. Way in there.
Attaboy.

458
00:25:09,909 --> 00:25:11,659
What the hell you doing here?

459
00:25:11,694 --> 00:25:14,445
I swear to God, the kid left so much
booger powder in there,

460
00:25:14,497 --> 00:25:16,381
my Caddy is a K-9 unit's
wet dream.

461
00:25:16,415 --> 00:25:19,050
Is your phone broken?
All 200 of them?

462
00:25:19,084 --> 00:25:21,469
Huell's gone.

463
00:25:21,504 --> 00:25:23,388
Huell's gone where?

464
00:25:23,422 --> 00:25:25,340
No idea. AWOL.

465
00:25:25,374 --> 00:25:27,258
Nobody's seen him.
He's not answering his phone.

466
00:25:27,309 --> 00:25:29,210
So what about Jesse?

467
00:25:29,228 --> 00:25:31,212
He hasn't shown up yet.

468
00:25:31,230 --> 00:25:33,848
He will, Saul.
He's probably high as a kite somewhere

469
00:25:33,882 --> 00:25:35,767
and hasn't gotten
our message yet.

470
00:25:35,818 --> 00:25:38,436
Or he got it loud and clear
and figured out it's a setup.

471
00:25:38,487 --> 00:25:41,272
The kid is not as dumb
as you think.

472
00:25:47,062 --> 00:25:50,331
Are you wearing
a bulletproof vest?

473
00:25:50,366 --> 00:25:53,067
Did you miss the part about
my bodyguard has gone missing?

474
00:25:53,085 --> 00:25:56,004
Look, I had him
watching the dog house,

475
00:25:56,038 --> 00:25:58,006
figuring the kid might show up
for a fix.

476
00:25:58,040 --> 00:26:00,174
Next thing I know, radio silence.

477
00:26:00,209 --> 00:26:02,577
You're the math whiz.
Add up two and two.

478
00:26:02,595 --> 00:26:05,630
Jesse is not on
some killing spree.

479
00:26:05,681 --> 00:26:07,682
It's me he wants.

480
00:26:07,716 --> 00:26:09,417
It's just me.

481
00:26:09,435 --> 00:26:11,252
Then where the hell's Huell?

482
00:26:17,109 --> 00:26:19,227
Any news?

483
00:26:19,261 --> 00:26:21,429
Not yet, but soon.
I promise.

484
00:26:21,447 --> 00:26:24,282
- Have an A-1 day.
- Okay.

485
00:26:28,704 --> 00:26:31,122
Next...

486
00:26:31,156 --> 00:26:33,825
inventory lists.

487
00:26:47,289 --> 00:26:49,891
...uh, ten pine-scented
air fresheners.

488
00:26:49,925 --> 00:26:51,959
You mark "ten" under this column,

489
00:26:51,977 --> 00:26:54,512
and then you subtract ten from
the actual stock column here.

490
00:26:54,563 --> 00:26:56,464
Okay?
Why don't you try that?

491
00:27:07,443 --> 00:27:08,476
Jesse?

492
00:27:08,494 --> 00:27:10,411
<i>Got my photo, bitch?</i>

493
00:27:10,446 --> 00:27:12,413
<i>That barrel look familiar?</i>

494
00:27:12,448 --> 00:27:15,650
<i>'Cause I just found six more
exactly like it.</i>

495
00:27:22,207 --> 00:27:24,492
<i>That big bastard
who works for Goodman...</i>

496
00:27:24,510 --> 00:27:26,761
<i>I pistol-whipped
that melon he calls a head</i>

497
00:27:26,795 --> 00:27:28,429
<i>till he gave up what he knew,</i>

498
00:27:28,464 --> 00:27:30,298
<i>which led me to your rental van,</i>

499
00:27:30,332 --> 00:27:32,333
<i>which, it turns out, had GPS.</i>

500
00:27:32,351 --> 00:27:34,852
<i>How do you like that, genius?</i>

501
00:27:34,887 --> 00:27:36,854
<i>Guess you didn't think
of everything.</i>

502
00:27:36,889 --> 00:27:40,141
Look, Jesse, I don't know what
you plan on doing here, but...

503
00:27:40,175 --> 00:27:42,727
<i>Well, I'll give you a hint, Walt.</i>

504
00:27:42,778 --> 00:27:45,113
<i>It involves a couple
of five-gallon cans</i>

505
00:27:45,147 --> 00:27:46,948
<i>of gasoline and a lighter.</i>

506
00:27:46,982 --> 00:27:49,400
No, no, no, no, no!
Jesse, please, listen to me.

507
00:27:49,451 --> 00:27:50,985
<i>No, you listen to me, bitch!</i>

508
00:27:51,019 --> 00:27:53,354
<i>You get your ass out here
as fast as you can.</i>

509
00:27:53,372 --> 00:27:55,456
Yes, I'm coming!
Okay? Okay!

510
00:27:55,491 --> 00:27:58,960
<i>And don't even think about
calling anyone for help, all right?</i>

511
00:27:58,994 --> 00:28:01,362
<i>You hang up on me,
put me on hold,</i>

512
00:28:01,380 --> 00:28:03,364
<i>I lose my call for any reason,</i>

513
00:28:03,382 --> 00:28:06,334
<i>as soon as you do,
I'm burning all of it.</i>

514
00:28:06,368 --> 00:28:08,886
<i>All right? One big bonfire.
You get the picture?</i>

515
00:28:08,921 --> 00:28:10,555
I get it.
I get it. Okay.

516
00:28:10,589 --> 00:28:12,056
<i>All right.
Well, you better hurry,</i>

517
00:28:12,091 --> 00:28:14,041
<i>'cause I'm burning
ten grand a minute</i>

518
00:28:14,059 --> 00:28:16,210
<i>till you get here,
starting right now.</i>

519
00:28:16,228 --> 00:28:19,063
I said I'm coming!
Don't you touch my money!

520
00:28:19,098 --> 00:28:21,015
<i>Fire in the hole, bitch.</i>

521
00:28:21,049 --> 00:28:22,767
<i>There goes ten G's.</i>

522
00:28:22,818 --> 00:28:26,104
<i>Aw, nice orange flames.
No. No, no, no, no, no!</i>

523
00:28:29,391 --> 00:28:31,225
Jesse... Jesse, please.

524
00:28:31,243 --> 00:28:34,362
I'm dying.
My cancer is back.

525
00:28:34,396 --> 00:28:37,898
You're not hurting anyone
but my family. Okay?

526
00:28:37,916 --> 00:28:40,084
Look, I... I can't
spend this money.

527
00:28:40,119 --> 00:28:43,337
It's not for me.
I won't be around long enough to use it.

528
00:28:43,372 --> 00:28:45,256
It belongs to my children.

529
00:28:45,290 --> 00:28:48,092
<i>Oh, you're gonna talk about kids.</i>

530
00:28:48,127 --> 00:28:49,794
<i>You're seriously gonna go there?</i>

531
00:28:51,513 --> 00:28:54,265
I am sorry about Brock.

532
00:28:54,267 --> 00:28:56,217
<i>- No, you're not.
- I am.</i>

533
00:28:56,251 --> 00:28:57,719
<i>You're not, but you're gonna be.</i>

534
00:28:57,753 --> 00:29:00,921
Yes, I am sorry about Brock!

535
00:29:00,939 --> 00:29:02,857
But he's alive, isn't he?

536
00:29:02,891 --> 00:29:05,643
He's fine, just as I planned it!

537
00:29:05,694 --> 00:29:08,563
Don't you think I knew
exactly how much to give him?

538
00:29:08,597 --> 00:29:10,565
That I had it all measured out?
Come on!

539
00:29:10,599 --> 00:29:13,117
<i>- Don't you know me by now?
- I know you're a lying,</i>

540
00:29:13,152 --> 00:29:15,603
<i>evil scumbag, that's what I know.</i>

541
00:29:15,621 --> 00:29:18,623
<i>Manipulating people,</i>

542
00:29:18,657 --> 00:29:20,341
<i>- messing with their heads.
- Open your eyes!</i>

543
00:29:20,375 --> 00:29:24,245
Can't you see that I needed you
on my side to kill Gus?

544
00:29:24,279 --> 00:29:26,664
I ran over those gangbangers!

545
00:29:26,715 --> 00:29:29,467
I killed Emilio
and Krazy-8! Why?

546
00:29:29,501 --> 00:29:32,470
I did all of those things
to try to save your life

547
00:29:32,504 --> 00:29:34,138
as much as mine,

548
00:29:34,173 --> 00:29:36,007
only you're too stupid
to know it!

549
00:29:40,846 --> 00:29:42,930
Jesse...

550
00:29:42,964 --> 00:29:45,800
Jesse!

551
00:29:45,818 --> 00:29:47,485
Jesse, talk to me.

552
00:29:49,188 --> 00:29:50,855
Jesse!

553
00:29:55,811 --> 00:29:58,496
Jesse, I didn't hang up!
Jesse!

554
00:30:11,009 --> 00:30:12,877
Jesse?

555
00:30:14,930 --> 00:30:17,515
Jesse, I'm here.
Where are you?

556
00:31:05,514 --> 00:31:07,882
Son of a bitch.

557
00:31:09,268 --> 00:31:11,402
Son of a bitch.

558
00:31:16,191 --> 00:31:18,192
Son of a bitch!

559
00:32:02,487 --> 00:32:05,606
No. No.
No, no, no.

560
00:32:42,244 --> 00:32:43,694
Come on, come on.

561
00:32:43,745 --> 00:32:45,780
Yes.

562
00:32:50,035 --> 00:32:51,168
Yeah?

563
00:32:51,203 --> 00:32:53,421
It's me.
I've got Jesse in sight,

564
00:32:53,455 --> 00:32:55,840
and he's coming for me right now.

565
00:32:55,874 --> 00:32:58,459
<i>He knows I'm alone.</i>

566
00:32:58,493 --> 00:33:00,628
<i>I'm guessing he's got backup.</i>

567
00:33:00,662 --> 00:33:03,631
<i>- How many guys?
- I don... I... I don't know.</i>

568
00:33:03,665 --> 00:33:07,077
<i>- Where are you?
- Tohajiilee.</i>

569
00:33:07,112 --> 00:33:09,070
<i>Indian reservation, west of town.</i>

570
00:33:09,105 --> 00:33:11,188
<i>- Get a pen.
- Go.</i>

571
00:33:11,223 --> 00:33:13,307
Okay.

572
00:33:14,643 --> 00:33:16,978
Okay.

573
00:33:17,012 --> 00:33:20,314
"34, 59, 20,

574
00:33:20,348 --> 00:33:23,651
<i>106, 36, 52."</i>

575
00:33:23,685 --> 00:33:26,537
Those are coordinates.

576
00:33:26,571 --> 00:33:28,906
<i>If you want me around
to cook for you,</i>

577
00:33:28,957 --> 00:33:30,574
<i>- you get here right now.
- You got it.</i>

578
00:33:30,625 --> 00:33:33,193
As fast as you can.
Okay. Wait.

579
00:33:34,195 --> 00:33:36,414
They're coming.

580
00:33:36,465 --> 00:33:38,499
It looks like
there could be three men total.

581
00:33:43,388 --> 00:33:45,039
Wait a minute.

582
00:33:45,057 --> 00:33:47,258
What?
What is it?

583
00:33:47,309 --> 00:33:49,477
Stay in the car.

584
00:33:49,511 --> 00:33:52,618
<i>- Oh, my God.
- Walter, what is it?</i>

585
00:33:55,740 --> 00:33:57,598
<i>Walter, you still there?</i>

586
00:34:00,006 --> 00:34:01,287
<i>Walter!</i>

587
00:34:06,154 --> 00:34:08,207
<i>Walter, you got eyes on him?</i>

588
00:34:13,595 --> 00:34:15,586
<i>What do you see?</i>

589
00:34:20,048 --> 00:34:21,702
<i>Walter, talk to me.</i>

590
00:34:22,677 --> 00:34:24,678
Forget it.

591
00:34:26,048 --> 00:34:27,932
Don't come.

592
00:34:27,966 --> 00:34:29,600
What do you mean, "Don't come"?

593
00:34:29,634 --> 00:34:30,935
<i>It's off.</i>

594
00:34:32,437 --> 00:34:34,488
Do not come.

595
00:34:59,948 --> 00:35:02,333
Walt!

596
00:35:02,384 --> 00:35:04,451
Come on out!

597
00:35:07,122 --> 00:35:08,956
Walt!

598
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:18,015
Walt!

599
00:35:18,066 --> 00:35:20,434
I know you're out here!

600
00:35:25,277 --> 00:35:26,968
It's over!

601
00:35:50,410 --> 00:35:52,077
Walt!

602
00:35:54,581 --> 00:35:56,682
Come on out, Walt!

603
00:36:06,092 --> 00:36:08,427
Got him.

604
00:36:26,463 --> 00:36:28,848
Drop it!

605
00:36:37,340 --> 00:36:39,025
Hands up!

606
00:36:45,982 --> 00:36:48,517
Walk towards me slowly!

607
00:37:21,468 --> 00:37:23,719
Stop.

608
00:37:23,770 --> 00:37:25,771
Turn around.

609
00:37:30,861 --> 00:37:33,729
Lace your fingers
behind your head.

610
00:37:36,233 --> 00:37:38,350
Walk backwards to me.

611
00:37:42,355 --> 00:37:44,240
Stop.

612
00:37:44,291 --> 00:37:46,208
Get on your knees.

613
00:38:18,725 --> 00:38:21,727
How'd you like
my barrel photo, huh?

614
00:38:21,745 --> 00:38:24,413
Took it in the backyard
by the barbecue grill.

615
00:38:24,447 --> 00:38:28,083
You know, where we used to
cook out with the family.

616
00:38:28,118 --> 00:38:31,370
Gomie thought the dirt
might not match. But me?

617
00:38:31,404 --> 00:38:33,405
I bet your greedy ass
would be so worked up

618
00:38:33,423 --> 00:38:35,457
about the prospect
of losing your cash

619
00:38:35,509 --> 00:38:37,510
that you wouldn't catch it.

620
00:38:38,762 --> 00:38:40,746
Looks like I was right.

621
00:38:40,764 --> 00:38:42,715
He's clean.

622
00:38:44,100 --> 00:38:46,452
Yo, I remember this place.

623
00:38:46,486 --> 00:38:50,055
The very first place
we cooked, like, ever.

624
00:38:51,308 --> 00:38:54,894
It is, isn't it?

625
00:38:54,928 --> 00:38:58,430
Hey, uh, what say
you save us the busywork, Walt,

626
00:38:58,448 --> 00:39:02,401
and point out the spot
where you buried your money?

627
00:39:06,272 --> 00:39:08,273
No?

628
00:39:08,291 --> 00:39:10,209
No matter.

629
00:39:10,243 --> 00:39:13,329
I'll get a search team out here.
We'll find it.

630
00:39:15,966 --> 00:39:18,968
Agent Gomez,
shall we flip a coin for the honors?

631
00:39:19,002 --> 00:39:21,003
No way, man.
It's all yours.

632
00:39:21,054 --> 00:39:22,120
All right.

633
00:39:23,340 --> 00:39:25,257
Walter White,

634
00:39:25,291 --> 00:39:27,292
you have the right
to remain silent.

635
00:39:27,310 --> 00:39:30,179
Anything you say can
and will be used against you

636
00:39:30,230 --> 00:39:31,597
in a court of law.

637
00:39:31,631 --> 00:39:33,515
You have the right
to speak to an attorney

638
00:39:33,567 --> 00:39:35,434
and have an attorney present
during any questioning.

639
00:39:35,468 --> 00:39:37,686
If you cannot afford an attorney,

640
00:39:37,737 --> 00:39:40,189
one will be provided for you
at the government's expense.

641
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:44,326
Do you understand these rights
as I have just recited them to you?

642
00:39:45,779 --> 00:39:47,446
Coward.

643
00:40:03,847 --> 00:40:05,714
Back off! Back off!

644
00:40:05,765 --> 00:40:07,132
Get over here!
Get over here!

645
00:40:07,166 --> 00:40:09,635
- Get in the truck!
- Bring it, bitch!

646
00:40:09,669 --> 00:40:11,553
- Put him in the car!
- Come on!

647
00:40:11,605 --> 00:40:14,023
Get in the car!
Hurry up! Get in.

648
00:40:17,343 --> 00:40:19,812
Get in the car, kid.
Come on.

649
00:40:29,289 --> 00:40:31,356
Gonna take him down
for booking, okay?

650
00:40:31,374 --> 00:40:34,159
I think you should stay here
till I come back with a search team.

651
00:40:34,193 --> 00:40:36,161
You got it.
I'd take the kid with me,

652
00:40:36,195 --> 00:40:38,714
but they'd probably
kill each other on the way.

653
00:40:40,250 --> 00:40:43,731
- Congratulations, buddy.
- Hey.

654
00:40:47,474 --> 00:40:50,225
I'll call the Tribal Police on the way out,
let 'em know we're here.

655
00:40:50,260 --> 00:40:52,878
Gonna make a phone call.

656
00:41:08,662 --> 00:41:12,965
Hank, why is there what looks
like brains in our garbage can?

657
00:41:12,999 --> 00:41:15,250
Hey, baby. I got him.

658
00:41:15,285 --> 00:41:16,952
Dead to rights.

659
00:41:18,254 --> 00:41:20,005
You got Walt?

660
00:41:20,040 --> 00:41:21,340
<i>Yeah.</i>

661
00:41:21,374 --> 00:41:24,176
<i>I got him in handcuffs
as we speak.</i>

662
00:41:24,210 --> 00:41:27,963
<i>Want me to wave to him
for you? Huh?</i>

663
00:41:30,934 --> 00:41:33,352
Well, he's not, uh...

664
00:41:33,386 --> 00:41:35,387
he's not feeling too friendly.

665
00:41:35,421 --> 00:41:38,423
Oh, my God.

666
00:41:38,441 --> 00:41:41,060
You did it.

667
00:41:41,094 --> 00:41:42,728
Thank God.

668
00:41:42,762 --> 00:41:44,446
<i>Things are gonna be</i>

669
00:41:44,481 --> 00:41:48,000
a little rough for the next couple weeks,
but they'll get better.

670
00:41:52,789 --> 00:41:54,456
Baby, you okay?

671
00:41:56,993 --> 00:41:59,161
I'm much better now.

672
00:42:01,881 --> 00:42:03,916
I gotta go.

673
00:42:03,950 --> 00:42:05,951
It may be awhile
before I get home.

674
00:42:10,123 --> 00:42:11,807
I love you.

675
00:42:13,009 --> 00:42:15,010
I love you too.

676
00:42:44,207 --> 00:42:46,175
Who the hell is this?

677
00:42:46,209 --> 00:42:48,210
Tribal Police?

678
00:42:50,513 --> 00:42:53,966
Hank! Hank! Hank!

679
00:43:11,383 --> 00:43:12,734
No...

680
00:43:21,044 --> 00:43:23,528
Police!
Drop your weapons!

681
00:43:23,546 --> 00:43:26,882
Jack, don't do it!

682
00:43:26,916 --> 00:43:28,500
Jack!

683
00:43:31,204 --> 00:43:34,256
Drop... your... weapons!

684
00:43:34,307 --> 00:43:36,558
You heard the man!
Put 'em down!

685
00:43:36,593 --> 00:43:39,544
How do we know you're cops?

686
00:43:39,562 --> 00:43:41,680
Show us some ID!

687
00:43:41,714 --> 00:43:45,601
Damn straight!
Let's see some badges!

688
00:43:45,652 --> 00:43:47,269
Jack!

689
00:43:47,320 --> 00:43:50,388
Jack, don't do it!
Jack!

690
00:43:51,524 --> 00:43:55,194
No, Jack! It's off!
Jack!

691
00:43:55,228 --> 00:43:58,280
We'll give ourselves up
if you show us some badges!

692
00:44:01,084 --> 00:44:03,085
Simple as that!

693
00:44:04,420 --> 00:44:06,421
How 'bout it?

694
00:44:06,456 --> 00:44:08,290
No!

695
00:44:09,342 --> 00:44:10,909
Jack!

696
00:44:10,927 --> 00:44:12,928
Jack!

697
00:44:14,764 --> 00:44:17,916
Jack, it's off!

698
00:44:17,934 --> 00:44:19,384
Forget it!

699
00:44:19,418 --> 00:44:21,086
Jack!

700
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:37,241
