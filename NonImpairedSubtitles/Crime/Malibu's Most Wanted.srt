1
00:00:25,304 --> 00:00:28,398
Growing up in the streets ain 't no joke.


2
00:00:29,207 --> 00:00:31,004
There's crazy crime...


3
00:00:32,010 --> 00:00:33,534
...drugs...


4
00:00:33,712 --> 00:00:35,737
...and mad violence.


5
00:00:35,914 --> 00:00:37,575
Yeah, the streets is tough.


6
00:00:37,749 --> 00:00:41,310
But there ain 't no streets tougher
than mine. The streets of...


7
00:00:42,721 --> 00:00:44,382
...Malibu.


8
00:00:46,191 --> 00:00:48,682
It's hardcore up in the 'Bu, y'all.


9
00:00:48,860 --> 00:00:51,055
It's just part of the everyday struggle.


10
00:00:51,229 --> 00:00:53,925
Things go down here
people should never see.


11
00:00:54,099 --> 00:00:56,329
We got bag ladies...


12
00:00:56,969 --> 00:00:59,130
...big ballers...


13
00:00:59,504 --> 00:01:01,802
...everybody strapped with a 9.


14
00:01:04,476 --> 00:01:07,240
This is my ghetto. The mall.


15
00:01:07,412 --> 00:01:10,609
Most of the time the police
won 't even come through.


16
00:01:10,782 --> 00:01:13,148
We got all sorts of sets up in here.


17
00:01:13,318 --> 00:01:15,548
We got the beach boys...


18
00:01:16,822 --> 00:01:20,849
...the A CCs:
the Abused Children of Celebrities...


19
00:01:21,026 --> 00:01:23,153
...and this is my crew.


20
00:01:24,096 --> 00:01:27,657
That's my boy Mocha.
That brother straight-up crazy.


21
00:01:27,833 --> 00:01:30,165
He did time in public school!


22
00:01:31,169 --> 00:01:35,230
That there is Hadji.
He's the Beast from the Middle East.


23
00:01:35,874 --> 00:01:39,173
And that's Monster.
She had a big chip on her shoulder...


24
00:01:39,344 --> 00:01:40,936
...till she ate it.


25
00:01:45,851 --> 00:01:49,150
Hey, that's me! B-Rad G.


26
00:01:49,621 --> 00:01:52,055
I run things around here.


27
00:01:52,224 --> 00:01:54,886
Now, sometimes bustas
be disrespecting.


28
00:01:55,060 --> 00:01:59,087
And you can 't punk out,
no matter what the devil may bring.


29
00:01:59,264 --> 00:02:03,701
Hey, yo, fool! We about to have some
hardcore drama go down right about now!


30
00:02:03,869 --> 00:02:05,063
That's right!


31
00:02:05,470 --> 00:02:09,304
This our mall.
Always has been, always will be.


32
00:02:09,808 --> 00:02:11,673
Mr. Amerislani.


33
00:02:11,843 --> 00:02:16,644
Our clerk accidentally gave you
the wrong aromatherapy candles.


34
00:02:17,249 --> 00:02:18,910
Here you go!


35
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:24,746
-You validate parking?
-Of course, sir.


36
00:02:26,091 --> 00:02:29,492
That's what I'm talking about!
We get ours!


37
00:02:32,097 --> 00:02:33,587
That's my crib.


38
00:02:33,765 --> 00:02:36,825
It ain 't much, but it's all I got.


39
00:02:38,136 --> 00:02:39,603
If you elect me governor....


40
00:02:39,771 --> 00:02:42,001
That's my pops, Bill Gluckman.


41
00:02:42,774 --> 00:02:45,106
He getting his campaign on.


42
00:02:45,510 --> 00:02:48,741
I got mad love for the man,
but he 's old-school.


43
00:02:48,914 --> 00:02:53,044
He needs to bring his word to the street.
That's where I come in.


44
00:02:53,218 --> 00:02:54,276
You see, friends...


45
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:57,714
...California is my family.


46
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:05,963
And speaking of family,
I want to introduce my wife, Bess.


47
00:03:06,965 --> 00:03:09,559
And my daughter, little Brenda.


48
00:03:10,469 --> 00:03:12,801
-Where's your son Brad?
-Yes, sir, where is he?


49
00:03:15,107 --> 00:03:19,134
Thank you for your questions.
Unfortunately, we are out of time for today.


50
00:03:31,823 --> 00:03:35,589
Yo, what's up, y'all?
This is B-Rad G, kicking it from 'Bu.


51
00:03:36,228 --> 00:03:37,855
Represizzent!


52
00:03:38,697 --> 00:03:40,995
Hi, Pops, it's me! B-Rad!


53
00:03:41,366 --> 00:03:42,355
Hi, Brad.


54
00:04:07,092 --> 00:04:09,720
Show's over! That's it. Show's over!


55
00:04:12,230 --> 00:04:15,666
See that?
I know how to get the party started!


56
00:04:15,834 --> 00:04:18,098
And I know my pop was loving it.


57
00:04:18,270 --> 00:04:19,464
It's a disaster!


58
00:04:19,638 --> 00:04:22,732
The Times and the Chronicle
will run it as a big joke.


59
00:04:22,908 --> 00:04:25,468
-Thank God!
-How did this happen?


60
00:04:25,644 --> 00:04:28,477
I have no idea.
I didn't even know he was in town!


61
00:04:28,647 --> 00:04:32,447
We can't keep tabs on this kid?
Can anybody tell me where he is?


62
00:04:32,617 --> 00:04:34,312
That was off the hinges!


63
00:04:34,486 --> 00:04:37,580
I just got you another million votes
right there!


64
00:04:39,391 --> 00:04:41,291
What you doing here, son?


65
00:04:43,862 --> 00:04:46,888
I knew I had to show up
in order for you to blow up!


66
00:04:47,065 --> 00:04:50,262
So I called up Captain Tony,
he fired up the Lear jizzy...


67
00:04:50,435 --> 00:04:52,801
...and boo-yah! I'm in the hizzy.


68
00:04:52,971 --> 00:04:55,531
I'll be on the campaign trizzy too. 24/7.


69
00:04:55,707 --> 00:04:58,175
You know, kissing babies and whatnot.


70
00:04:58,343 --> 00:05:00,311
Pound it.



71
00:05:01,813 --> 00:05:04,646
Yeah, all good. Tom, you down, you gots....


72
00:05:04,816 --> 00:05:08,115
Okay, dude.
I'll let you all do your campaign thing.


73
00:05:10,555 --> 00:05:12,182
Oh, Bill....


74
00:05:13,859 --> 00:05:15,554
You need to shut this down.


75
00:05:15,727 --> 00:05:19,288
Tell your son that he cannot be
in your campaign, period.


76
00:05:19,464 --> 00:05:23,764
Wait a minute. I love his enthusiasm.
It's a little misguided, but....


77
00:05:23,935 --> 00:05:27,598
Isn't there something he can do
for the campaign where he can't hurt us?


78
00:05:27,772 --> 00:05:29,137
No.


79
00:05:30,141 --> 00:05:32,132
-Phones?
-No.


80
00:05:33,178 --> 00:05:35,043
Stuffing envelopes? Making signs?


81
00:05:37,182 --> 00:05:38,376
Signs.


82
00:05:39,251 --> 00:05:41,412
In Bill Gluckman's administration...


83
00:05:41,586 --> 00:05:44,316
...women are going to have
better health care.


84
00:05:47,659 --> 00:05:50,526
Women are going to have better daycare!


85
00:05:52,464 --> 00:05:54,955
And women will have better jobs!


86
00:05:56,201 --> 00:06:00,729
In fact, after today,
my campaign has a new slogan:


87
00:06:12,851 --> 00:06:15,445
" Bill Gluckman is down with
the bitches and the ho's"?


88
00:06:15,620 --> 00:06:19,056
It was supposed to have read
"Women are first with Gluckman."


89
00:06:19,224 --> 00:06:21,988
No, no. That's old-school, Pops.


90
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:24,822
You need to keep your pimp hand strong.


91
00:06:28,533 --> 00:06:30,023
So, Bradley....


92
00:06:30,201 --> 00:06:32,396
Yo, why you keep calling me that?


93
00:06:32,938 --> 00:06:35,338
Well, that's your name, isn't it?


94
00:06:35,507 --> 00:06:37,702
It's my slave name, all right?


95
00:06:38,576 --> 00:06:40,669
I told you like 50 times!


96
00:06:40,845 --> 00:06:42,210
Okay.


97
00:06:42,814 --> 00:06:44,577
B-Rad.


98
00:06:45,250 --> 00:06:46,808
What's up?


99
00:06:46,985 --> 00:06:50,216
What are your goals, B-Rad?
What do you want out of life?


100
00:06:50,388 --> 00:06:52,913
To be the biggest rapper there ever was.


101
00:06:53,224 --> 00:06:56,125
You see, doc, I got something to say...


102
00:06:56,294 --> 00:06:58,694
...and I need the world to hear it.


103
00:06:58,863 --> 00:07:00,956
I'm a "lyrisologist."


104
00:07:01,132 --> 00:07:02,622
I can rap about anything.


105
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:19,407
See? I'm the shiznit! I'll buy y'all cars.


106
00:07:22,287 --> 00:07:23,618
I see.


107
00:07:24,255 --> 00:07:27,247
When did you first start feeling
like you were this...


108
00:07:28,326 --> 00:07:29,725
...shiznit?


109
00:07:29,894 --> 00:07:33,830
Dang, way back in the day.


110
00:07:33,999 --> 00:07:38,402
I had these beats in my head
since I was a little shorty.


111
00:07:54,185 --> 00:07:57,279
From then on in, it was hip-hop 24/7.


112
00:07:58,623 --> 00:08:02,150
As I was growing up, my parents
and me couldn 't communicate.


113
00:08:02,327 --> 00:08:04,386
They were always on different channels.


114
00:08:04,562 --> 00:08:07,622
Finish those vegetables, Bradley.
They smell good.


115
00:08:07,799 --> 00:08:09,664
You won 't be excused until you do.


116
00:08:10,535 --> 00:08:11,968
Forget y'all!


117
00:08:12,137 --> 00:08:13,570
That's it, mister--


118
00:08:19,310 --> 00:08:23,371
What I ' m sensing, Brad...


119
00:08:23,548 --> 00:08:25,072
...is that...


120
00:08:25,917 --> 00:08:28,317
...your parents weren ' t always
there for you.


121
00:08:28,486 --> 00:08:30,579
-No.
-That's ridiculous.


122
00:08:30,755 --> 00:08:32,882
What about your bar mitzvah?


123
00:08:36,227 --> 00:08:41,130
What's the theme of your bar mitzvah?
Star Wars? Baseball? Superheroes?


124
00:08:41,299 --> 00:08:44,462
-It's O.P.P., bitch!
-What?


125
00:08:57,816 --> 00:08:59,215
Bess.


126
00:09:00,251 --> 00:09:02,116
I think you want to share.


127
00:09:03,154 --> 00:09:06,351
B-Rad, you're a wonderful son.
It's just that....


128
00:09:07,692 --> 00:09:09,091
Well....


129
00:09:11,529 --> 00:09:14,930
Bess, let's not beat around the bush.
Brad...


130
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:18,934
...your behavior has become
an embarrassment to the family.


131
00:09:19,104 --> 00:09:20,503
Don't be hating.


132
00:09:20,672 --> 00:09:23,038
And I can't have you
on the campaign anymore.


133
00:09:24,509 --> 00:09:27,842
What? That's how it is?
You done it now!


134
00:09:28,012 --> 00:09:30,412
Y'all opened up big a can of tough love!


135
00:09:35,453 --> 00:09:38,547
-What can we do, doctor?
-I don't know.


136
00:09:40,358 --> 00:09:44,124
This is the most advanced case
of "gangsta-phrenia" I've ever seen.


137
00:09:44,395 --> 00:09:47,057
Three colors for our country.
Where's the red?


138
00:09:47,532 --> 00:09:49,557
Bill! Hey, Bill.


139
00:09:49,734 --> 00:09:51,895
-How'd it go with Dr. Feldman?
-Great.


140
00:09:52,070 --> 00:09:55,039
If he sees Brad five times a week
for the next three or four years...


141
00:09:55,206 --> 00:09:57,197
...we should see some real improvement.


142
00:09:57,375 --> 00:10:01,004
But, sir, the election is eight weeks away.


143
00:10:01,179 --> 00:10:02,840
-Right, good point.
-It's okay.


144
00:10:03,014 --> 00:10:05,710
We've been brainstorming
some different approaches...


145
00:10:05,884 --> 00:10:08,944
-...and we might have something solid.
-Well, I'm all ears.


146
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:12,021
-Go!
-Okay, sir.


147
00:10:12,190 --> 00:10:15,523
Brad acts ghetto, right?


148
00:10:15,693 --> 00:10:18,059
But he's never been east
of Beverly Hills.


149
00:10:18,229 --> 00:10:20,993
But what if we give him
a little dose of reality?


150
00:10:21,166 --> 00:10:23,430
Let him get a firsthand look
at the ghetto.


151
00:10:23,601 --> 00:10:26,195
-You mean have Brad actually go there?
-Exactly.


152
00:10:26,371 --> 00:10:29,807
-Well, now, that sounds dangerous.
-No! Perfectly safe.


153
00:10:30,675 --> 00:10:33,769
-How's it work?
-We hire actors to play gangstas.


154
00:10:33,945 --> 00:10:38,473
Right. They will carjack Brad
and take him on a tour around the 'hood.


155
00:10:38,650 --> 00:10:41,346
Give him a taste of what
the thug life is really like.


156
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:44,613
-lt might just scare the black out of him.
-Excuse me?


157
00:10:46,791 --> 00:10:49,282
Hey, don't you have something to do?


158
00:10:51,663 --> 00:10:53,062
Enough of the P.C.


159
00:10:53,231 --> 00:10:57,099
Fact is, unless we do something now,
Brad is going to cost us this election.


160
00:10:57,268 --> 00:10:58,758
Who would play the gangsters?


161
00:10:58,937 --> 00:11:01,371
Remember the anti-crime spot
we shot a month ago?


162
00:11:01,539 --> 00:11:05,066
-We've got that queued up.
-Yes, we do. Over here, please.


163
00:11:06,344 --> 00:11:11,008
For too long, street violence
has torn Californians apart.


164
00:11:11,182 --> 00:11:14,413
Bill Gluckman wants
to put our divisions behind us.


165
00:11:14,586 --> 00:11:17,282
Hey, instead of thinking
about what set you're from...


166
00:11:17,455 --> 00:11:20,219
...or what crew you 're rolling with...


167
00:11:20,391 --> 00:11:22,484
... why don 't you both be brothers?


168
00:11:22,660 --> 00:11:23,718
What do you say?


169
00:11:23,895 --> 00:11:25,419
Your hair looks great.


170
00:11:26,931 --> 00:11:28,865
I ain't never thought of it like that.


171
00:11:29,033 --> 00:11:30,762
Shake hands.


172
00:11:34,105 --> 00:11:35,629
You see?


173
00:11:35,807 --> 00:11:38,401
California is my family.


174
00:11:45,984 --> 00:11:51,183
If we all work together as a family,
there's no telling how high we can go.


175
00:11:52,156 --> 00:11:55,887
See, that's beautiful.
These are the guys we're talking about.


176
00:11:56,661 --> 00:11:58,993
All right, let me get this straight.


177
00:11:59,163 --> 00:12:02,997
You want us to scare this kid
into acting like a little white boy again?


178
00:12:03,167 --> 00:12:05,158
If you don't think you can handle it--


179
00:12:05,336 --> 00:12:07,201
Of course we can handle it.


180
00:12:07,372 --> 00:12:11,206
-I'm from Juilliard, for chrissake.
-I'm from the Pasadena Playhouse.


181
00:12:12,343 --> 00:12:13,776
Good.


182
00:12:14,412 --> 00:12:16,880
I have some background information
on our dear boy Brad.


183
00:12:17,048 --> 00:12:18,037
Materials.


184
00:12:20,285 --> 00:12:22,378
Mali-bootay?


185
00:12:22,553 --> 00:12:25,078
Yes, he considers himself
a rapper of sorts.


186
00:12:26,791 --> 00:12:30,249
-Frigging A.
-The story is your basic kidnapping.


187
00:12:30,428 --> 00:12:32,828
By kidnapping, you mean
we hold him for ransom?


188
00:12:32,997 --> 00:12:34,692
Good question.


189
00:12:35,199 --> 00:12:36,188
Right.


190
00:12:37,201 --> 00:12:43,538
Now, when you see him start to get ghetto
and do his whole black thing-- Yes, that.


191
00:12:43,708 --> 00:12:45,232
I want it to piss you off.


192
00:12:45,410 --> 00:12:49,676
Tour him around the 'hood,
around the ghetto, if you will...


193
00:12:49,847 --> 00:12:53,408
-...and show him what it's really like.
-ln the ghetto?


194
00:12:53,584 --> 00:12:55,677
Pays 1 5 grand apiece, son.


195
00:12:55,987 --> 00:12:57,614
-We're in.
-Good.


196
00:12:57,789 --> 00:12:59,950
-Now, on the flip side....
-Flip it.


197
00:13:00,124 --> 00:13:04,857
If you two screw up and a single hair
is touched on Brad's overprivileged head...


198
00:13:05,029 --> 00:13:09,295
...I will see to it personally
that you two do some serious time.


199
00:13:09,467 --> 00:13:12,493
-Are we clear?
-Oh, we are Cristal.


200
00:13:13,938 --> 00:13:15,235
I like that.


201
00:13:20,945 --> 00:13:22,344
Mr. Gibbons.


202
00:13:23,114 --> 00:13:24,843
What about the money?


203
00:13:26,517 --> 00:13:28,485
We have 5 up front...


204
00:13:28,653 --> 00:13:31,588
...and 25 when you return him to us...


205
00:13:31,756 --> 00:13:32,848
...white.


206
00:13:33,591 --> 00:13:35,354
As the driven snow.


207
00:13:36,060 --> 00:13:39,894
-Pleasure doing business, gentlemen.
-Let me get that for you, sir.


208
00:13:40,398 --> 00:13:43,765
I'll call you. Or better yet, I'll holler.


209
00:13:44,268 --> 00:13:46,634
-We'll holler back!
-Holler back, player.


210
00:13:46,804 --> 00:13:49,102
Thank you. All right.


211
00:13:50,675 --> 00:13:53,337
Congratulations, buddy!
We just booked another gig!


212
00:13:53,511 --> 00:13:56,139
Not so fast, this is dangerous stuff.


213
00:13:56,314 --> 00:13:59,283
-This is the ghetto. We could get shot!
-Come on, man.


214
00:13:59,450 --> 00:14:02,351
We can handle ourselves. Right?


215
00:14:03,621 --> 00:14:07,648
This will be the ultimate acting challenge.


216
00:14:09,260 --> 00:14:11,694
-You know what really chaps my ass?
-What?


217
00:14:12,096 --> 00:14:15,361
After all of our years
of training and studying...


218
00:14:15,533 --> 00:14:18,366
...they continue to give us parts
that are gangbangers.


219
00:14:18,536 --> 00:14:23,405
Just once I'd like to play someone
who speaks with proper grammar...


220
00:14:23,574 --> 00:14:28,011
...and doesn't wear those Timberlands
with the laces undone, it's so sloppy.


221
00:14:28,179 --> 00:14:31,478
It beats getting dunked on
by Bill Gluckman!


222
00:14:31,649 --> 00:14:34,379
Do we even know anybody
that lives in the ghetto?


223
00:14:37,288 --> 00:14:38,949
My cousin.


224
00:14:39,424 --> 00:14:40,652
Shondra.


225
00:14:41,826 --> 00:14:46,263
That's the stupidest thing I ever heard.
I got better things to do with my time.


226
00:14:46,431 --> 00:14:49,696
Like what? Work at Wiener On A Bun?
Come on!


227
00:14:49,867 --> 00:14:53,428
Really, you're always talking about
improving yourself.


228
00:14:53,604 --> 00:14:56,573
-Here's your chance!
-I am improving myself, fool!


229
00:14:56,741 --> 00:15:00,336
I broke up with no-good, gangbanging Tec,
I'm going to beauty school...


230
00:15:00,511 --> 00:15:02,877
...and then I'm gonna hook up
my own salon.


231
00:15:03,047 --> 00:15:05,777
How about hooking a brother up
with a Pepsi and fries?


232
00:15:05,950 --> 00:15:07,383
Shut up, stupid.


233
00:15:07,552 --> 00:15:08,951
-PJ.
-What?
P J


234
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:10,212
You need to do this.


235
00:15:10,388 --> 00:15:12,982
You need to walk away
from this minimum-wage crap...


236
00:15:13,157 --> 00:15:16,126
...take these earnings
and start that beauty parlor.


237
00:15:18,029 --> 00:15:21,362
-What you paying?
-Business. We're in business.


238
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:24,698
-A grand.
-We're paying a grand.


239
00:15:24,869 --> 00:15:28,202
-Make it trey and we on.
-Three thousand dollars?!


240
00:15:28,573 --> 00:15:30,700
Or you can kiss my ass.


241
00:15:31,776 --> 00:15:33,607
-Deal.
-Hey, hey.


242
00:15:33,778 --> 00:15:36,212
Deal. Now what about those fries?


243
00:15:46,958 --> 00:15:48,687
Thank you.


244
00:15:49,126 --> 00:15:51,390
-Hey, Gladys?
-Yeah, baby?


245
00:15:51,729 --> 00:15:54,789
You ever feel like you don't belong?


246
00:15:54,966 --> 00:15:56,365
All the time.


247
00:15:56,534 --> 00:16:00,595
Most folk only feel comfortable
around folk that's the same as them.


248
00:16:00,771 --> 00:16:02,932
They get around folk that's different...


249
00:16:03,107 --> 00:16:07,771
...get all scared and angry,
want to keep them down.


250
00:16:09,013 --> 00:16:11,106
What do you do about it?


251
00:16:11,282 --> 00:16:15,275
Nothing to do but keep it real
and be proud of who you are.


252
00:16:16,721 --> 00:16:18,450
Gladys?


253
00:16:19,624 --> 00:16:22,252
When they gonna leave our people alone?


254
00:16:22,426 --> 00:16:24,724
I don't know, baby.


255
00:16:25,429 --> 00:16:27,522
I just don't know.


256
00:16:28,332 --> 00:16:30,459
Now eat your greens before they get cold.


257
00:16:32,670 --> 00:16:36,401
"Whack: Weak, of poor quality.


258
00:16:36,574 --> 00:16:38,667
Bad. Whack."


259
00:16:40,077 --> 00:16:42,841
Your alma mater is whack.


260
00:16:44,815 --> 00:16:48,376
"Dis: To disrespect, to embarrass."


261
00:16:51,188 --> 00:16:54,157
-Bring it on, baby.
-We are strapped now, brother!


262
00:16:54,325 --> 00:16:56,316
Set these bad boys down.


263
00:16:56,794 --> 00:16:58,659
This is exactly what we ordered?


264
00:16:58,829 --> 00:17:02,788
Yeah, man. They got the Glocks,
the Tec-9s, the Uzis.


265
00:17:02,967 --> 00:17:05,595
-Freeze, sucker!
-That's convincing, brother!


266
00:17:05,770 --> 00:17:07,101
Look, they're fake.


267
00:17:07,538 --> 00:17:10,336
What the hell is that?
What's going on with your hair?


268
00:17:10,508 --> 00:17:12,442
Yeah, check it out, man, my hair.


269
00:17:12,610 --> 00:17:15,977
-Shondra just did it for me.
-Yeah, I see that.


270
00:17:16,147 --> 00:17:17,978
-You hate it.
-No, I don't hate it.


271
00:17:18,149 --> 00:17:21,676
I thought my character
was gonna have the cornrows.


272
00:17:21,852 --> 00:17:24,412
-That's all.
-Okay, I see what it is.


273
00:17:24,589 --> 00:17:27,956
You're just jealous
because you didn't think of it first.


274
00:17:28,125 --> 00:17:31,754
Frigging A, I'm not jealous, all right.
I'm an actor and I would've....


275
00:17:31,929 --> 00:17:34,090
You're frigging whack...


276
00:17:34,265 --> 00:17:35,732
...and don't dis me!


277
00:17:39,403 --> 00:17:42,634
-Got the gangster gear, my dog.
-Okay, cool.


278
00:17:51,182 --> 00:17:53,309
-What is so funny?
-The wig!


279
00:17:56,153 --> 00:17:58,383
I didn't know it was Halloween!


280
00:17:58,556 --> 00:18:02,117
While you're out,
could you bring me back some candy?


281
00:18:04,829 --> 00:18:05,887
Whatever, dude!


282
00:18:06,063 --> 00:18:08,930
Give me your ride, punk,
or I will dust your ass.


283
00:18:10,001 --> 00:18:13,334
-Nope. Not convincing.
-Damn it!


284
00:18:13,504 --> 00:18:15,529
Find your core character, Sean.


285
00:18:15,706 --> 00:18:18,266
You are an oppressed black man...


286
00:18:18,442 --> 00:18:21,377
-...from the ghetto.
-I'm having trouble finding this one.


287
00:18:22,780 --> 00:18:25,510
-Think Tupac.
-All right. Let me try it again.


288
00:18:25,683 --> 00:18:27,412
I see it. Action!


289
00:18:27,585 --> 00:18:30,213
Give me your ride, punk,
or I will dust your ass!


290
00:18:30,388 --> 00:18:32,788
Add a "bitch" and I think you got it!


291
00:18:32,957 --> 00:18:36,222
Give me your ride, punk, or
I will dust your ass, bitch!


292
00:18:36,394 --> 00:18:38,555
-Bitch! Click it!
-Bitch!


293
00:18:38,729 --> 00:18:41,323
-Turn around and do it again!
-Bitch!


294
00:19:12,596 --> 00:19:15,190
-Domi-ho's!
-Boo-yah!


295
00:19:15,366 --> 00:19:18,233
I'll take my money and I'm gonna--


296
00:19:18,703 --> 00:19:21,171
Yo, fool! What, nucka, what?


297
00:19:22,873 --> 00:19:23,931
Damn!


298
00:20:04,148 --> 00:20:06,378
-Play that.

-B-Rad.

00:20:33,711 --> 00:20:36,339
I ain't seen you around here before.

00:20:36,514 --> 00:20:38,505
Where you reside?

310
00:20:41,118 --> 00:20:43,211

You heard me?
Hell, yeah. I'm a rhymer on time.

Right now it's just a demo.


321
00:21:14,451 --> 00:21:17,887
I sent it to Dre,
but he ain't got back to me yet.


322
00:21:18,589 --> 00:21:22,992

Hold up!


325
00:21:29,934 --> 00:21:31,299

Hell, yeah, I know Dre.

Yo, holla at him for me.

You know, he kind of private.


330
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:44,479
Please?


331
00:21:45,416 --> 00:21:48,681
You do got it going on

332
00:21:48,853 --> 00:21:51,549
I was on my way to go see him.
You wanna roll with me?


333
00:21:51,722 --> 00:21:54,919
-Right now?

00:24:37,187 --> 00:24:39,985
-Don't you talk about my mama.
-I'll talk all I want.

Your mama's so fat she uses Mexico,

391
00:25:21,765 --> 00:25:23,562
-Did he just say "brother"?
-No!


392
00:25:23,734 --> 00:25:26,999
-Whose brother?
-Yours, y'all! I'm down.

You ain't black.
And you can never be black!


395
00:25:33,844 --> 00:25:38,406
And your perpetrating ass

-My culture!

404
00:26:05,676 --> 00:26:09,168
Hey, Shondra, can you come by later?
Princess just had puppies.


405
00:26:09,346 --> 00:26:12,008
Okay, Sandy. Bye.


406
00:26:15,385 --> 00:26:18,218
-Pit bull puppies, fool!
-And they mean too.


407
00:26:18,388 --> 00:26:19,753
-Don't look at me!
-Come on!


408
00:26:19,923 --> 00:26:23,086
-Get your narrow bootie up in there.
-Get him up in there!


409
00:26:23,260 --> 00:26:26,388
-Fool, put your hands behind your back.
-Behind the back.


410
00:26:26,563 --> 00:26:28,292
You know what I'm about to do now?


411
00:26:28,465 --> 00:26:30,865
-I'm about to call your daddy.
-Call your daddy.


412
00:26:31,034 --> 00:26:36,563
You better hope your daddy home too.
If he ain't, you gonna be one dusted trick!


413
00:26:36,740 --> 00:26:39,573
Now get your ass on the bed, whitey!


414
00:26:45,482 --> 00:26:47,973
-Did you buy my rage?
-No. You're indicating.


415
00:26:48,152 --> 00:26:50,279
-lndicating?
-Yes, indicating.


416
00:26:50,454 --> 00:26:53,719
Excuse me?
I have never indicated in my life.


417
00:26:53,891 --> 00:26:56,359
Would you two fools just shut the hell up?


418
00:26:56,527 --> 00:26:58,188
She's right. Shut up.


419
00:26:58,896 --> 00:27:01,228
Thank you, Shondra. Whatever!


420
00:27:01,698 --> 00:27:03,825
All right, put this down. You're on.


421
00:27:04,001 --> 00:27:06,731
-Go, girlfriend. Do your thing.
-Give me this.


422
00:27:08,238 --> 00:27:10,069
Hey, Shondra.


423
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:11,901
If you have to...


424
00:27:13,010 --> 00:27:14,944
...show a little ass.


425
00:27:15,112 --> 00:27:16,511
Shut up.


426
00:27:22,886 --> 00:27:25,184
-You all right in here?
-Oh, yeah.


427
00:27:25,355 --> 00:27:30,520
I just been kidnapped, carjacked
and hands tied behind my back.


428
00:27:30,694 --> 00:27:33,026
But other than that, it's all good.


429
00:27:33,864 --> 00:27:37,322
Look, I'm sorry about all that.
That wasn't really my idea.


430
00:27:41,171 --> 00:27:43,071
I thought you liked me.


431
00:27:44,274 --> 00:27:47,937
-I do!
-Then how come you set me up?


432
00:27:49,413 --> 00:27:53,440
I had to. They threatened to kill me
if I didn't play along.


433
00:27:54,418 --> 00:27:56,147
-For real?
-Yeah.


434
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:59,881
-They straight-up killers out there!
-For real?


435
00:28:00,624 --> 00:28:03,718
Let me school you on something.
Help us both stay alive.


436
00:28:03,894 --> 00:28:06,522
-Okay.
-The one thing they hate...


437
00:28:06,697 --> 00:28:10,258
...more than anything
that really makes them crazy...


438
00:28:11,001 --> 00:28:14,300
-...is posers.
-Me too, girl. I feel you.


439
00:28:15,038 --> 00:28:18,530
-I'm talking about you.
-Me? I ain't a poser. Shoot.


440
00:28:18,709 --> 00:28:22,873
-I got a Ph.D., a Poser-Hater Degree.
-Come on, quit fronting.


441
00:28:23,046 --> 00:28:24,377
I ain't fronting.


442
00:28:24,548 --> 00:28:28,882
-This is my sizzal. For rizzal, my nizzal.
-Stop it!


443
00:28:29,052 --> 00:28:32,249
You stop it right now
and you listen to me.


444
00:28:32,422 --> 00:28:35,482
If you just be yourself,
a nice little white boy...


445
00:28:35,659 --> 00:28:39,254
-...I think I can convince them to let you go.
-But I'm being myself!


446
00:28:39,429 --> 00:28:41,795
I ams who I says I ams.


447
00:28:41,965 --> 00:28:45,560
Damn! Why won't anybody believe me?


448
00:28:50,307 --> 00:28:52,901
-Well?
-Maybe you should show him your ass.


449
00:28:58,081 --> 00:29:01,346
I thought that would have worked.
Weird.


450
00:29:01,918 --> 00:29:04,478
All right, what's next?


451
00:29:04,655 --> 00:29:06,589
-How about number three?
-Perfect.


452
00:29:06,757 --> 00:29:09,385
We're gonna take it
to an entirely different level.


453
00:29:09,559 --> 00:29:10,890
-I got it.
-What?


454
00:29:11,061 --> 00:29:15,589
I'm gonna walk in there and be crazy.
I'll be ghettofied, buckwild.


455
00:29:15,766 --> 00:29:19,293
You tell me, "Stick to the plan, man.
Stick to the plan." Got it?


456
00:29:19,970 --> 00:29:22,939
-Wake up, snowflake!
-Yeah!


457
00:29:23,106 --> 00:29:25,370
-We called your dad!
-What did he say?


458
00:29:25,542 --> 00:29:28,067
He said he'd think about it.


459
00:29:28,245 --> 00:29:30,440
He don't want your ass home right now.


460
00:29:30,614 --> 00:29:34,846
-I can't say that I blame him.
-Hell, no. Not the knife, dog!



461
00:29:35,619 --> 00:29:36,608
Now come on!


462
00:29:36,787 --> 00:29:39,278
-What you doing?
-Teach this white girl a lesson!


463
00:29:39,456 --> 00:29:41,981
Bloodbath, we said
we would stick to the plan!


464
00:29:42,159 --> 00:29:45,959
-Bloodbath, stick with the plan.
-Tree, the plan done changed!


465
00:29:46,129 --> 00:29:47,653
Wannabe say he down.


466
00:29:47,831 --> 00:29:51,028
I'm gonna show him just how
un-down he is!


467
00:29:51,201 --> 00:29:53,328
-I gotta cut him!
-No, you can't cut him!


468
00:29:53,503 --> 00:29:54,970
-I gotta.
-You don't gotta.


469
00:29:55,138 --> 00:29:56,435
We can't get our money!


470
00:29:56,606 --> 00:29:58,631
-I thought you said to cut him!
-No--


471
00:29:58,809 --> 00:30:01,300
-Okay, just the white meat.
-Move! Let me cut him!


472
00:30:01,478 --> 00:30:03,173
Don't kill him though, Bloodbath!


473
00:30:21,531 --> 00:30:23,726
All right, now, Malibu.


474
00:30:23,900 --> 00:30:28,894
I want you to go up in there.
You go get me six 40s of O.E.


475
00:30:29,072 --> 00:30:31,302
-And a fifth of Henny.
-Yeah.


476
00:30:31,475 --> 00:30:34,171
-Anything else, dog?
-No, playa, I'm cool.


477
00:30:34,344 --> 00:30:35,641
Right on. Right on.


478
00:30:35,812 --> 00:30:37,473
I'd like some Pringles.


479
00:30:38,048 --> 00:30:40,642
This ain't no picnic, bitch!


480
00:30:40,817 --> 00:30:45,186
I'm sorry. Y'all got some ducats?
Because since you stole my--


481
00:30:45,355 --> 00:30:46,413
Man!


482
00:30:46,690 --> 00:30:50,490
You about to go up in there
and give them Koreans your ends?


483
00:30:50,660 --> 00:30:53,356
-Hell, no!
-You jack that shit, fool!


484
00:30:53,530 --> 00:30:57,990
And if the Asiatic give you any static,
hit the fool with this right here.


485
00:30:58,168 --> 00:31:00,227
-Look at the little busta.
-Little busta.


486
00:31:00,404 --> 00:31:02,167
-Can't even swing a gat.
-Shoot.


487
00:31:02,339 --> 00:31:04,899
-Talking about "he down."
-But--


488
00:31:05,075 --> 00:31:07,600
-You use that or I'm gonna use it on you!
-Okay.


489
00:31:07,778 --> 00:31:09,541
And if you try to get away?


490
00:31:09,713 --> 00:31:13,012
I'm gonna let you taste a piece
of my blue steel. You feel me?


491
00:31:13,183 --> 00:31:14,343
Okay. All right.


492
00:31:14,518 --> 00:31:16,315
-Go on, get out!
-Okay.


493
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:18,244
Go!


494
00:31:25,662 --> 00:31:27,391
Hey, white boy.


495
00:31:34,604 --> 00:31:39,439
-"This ain't no picnic, bitch"? Wow!
-Thank you. I loved the blue steel line.


496
00:31:39,609 --> 00:31:40,598
Convincing.


497
00:31:53,557 --> 00:31:56,958
-I really can't believe that!
-Those improv classes are paying off.


498
00:31:57,127 --> 00:32:02,064
When you said, "This is no picnic, bitch,"
I screamed on the inside like one.


499
00:32:02,232 --> 00:32:03,631
-For real?
-Yeah, I said:


500
00:32:11,441 --> 00:32:13,636
I'm thirsty, I gotta tell you.


501
00:32:13,810 --> 00:32:18,008
And, boy, do I love Olde English.
It really helps quench my thirst.


502
00:32:37,434 --> 00:32:39,299
Can I help you?


503
00:32:47,043 --> 00:32:52,106
No, I'm gonna help myself to this O.E.
and anything else I want up in here, bitch!


504
00:33:03,660 --> 00:33:05,594
Can I help you?


505
00:33:11,835 --> 00:33:16,033
-Y'all never been robbed?
-Sure. Last week was 54 time.


506
00:33:16,206 --> 00:33:18,970
But they were cool.
No gun to head, never scream.


507
00:33:19,142 --> 00:33:22,009
-You know, good people.
-Cool.


508
00:33:22,279 --> 00:33:26,773
So, dude,
how much did you pay the guy?


509
00:33:26,950 --> 00:33:28,440
What are you talking about?


510
00:33:28,618 --> 00:33:32,179
-When you set this thing up yesterday.
-I thought you set it up.


511
00:33:33,657 --> 00:33:35,056
You mean--?


512
00:33:35,859 --> 00:33:38,157
Dude, the owner doesn't know
this is fake?


513
00:33:40,564 --> 00:33:42,964
$1 6.47.


514
00:33:46,903 --> 00:33:51,272
-Go in and save him! He could get shot!
-I'm not gonna go in there! You go in there!


515
00:33:51,441 --> 00:33:52,806
His frigging life
is at stake!


516
00:34:00,550 --> 00:34:02,245
My emergency stash!


517
00:34:02,719 --> 00:34:06,052
I'm glad you got cash, because
if you had tried to jack me, fool...


518
00:34:06,222 --> 00:34:09,248
...I was gonna have
to lay you out with this!


519
00:34:09,426 --> 00:34:11,417
And with this.


520
00:34:12,529 --> 00:34:14,588
And with that.


521
00:34:18,268 --> 00:34:20,236
Keep the change.


522
00:34:20,403 --> 00:34:23,395
-Do me this one favor.
-You are the driver. I am the shooter!


523
00:34:23,573 --> 00:34:25,438
-I'm scared of Koreans!
-You--


524
00:34:25,609 --> 00:34:28,043
Thank you. Thank you very much!
Come again!


525
00:34:29,245 --> 00:34:31,975
What I'm about to do right now,
I know it sounds whack...


526
00:34:32,148 --> 00:34:35,640
...but it's just a joke, okay?
So please don't shoot me?


527
00:34:38,021 --> 00:34:42,355
Yeah, that's right, fool! Next time
I'll bust a cap in your punk ass, bitch!


528
00:34:42,659 --> 00:34:46,288
Yeah, you lucky I don't burn you down!
Hell, yeah! Hell, yeah!


529
00:34:46,463 --> 00:34:49,227
-What the hell is wrong with you?
-You actually did it?


530
00:34:49,399 --> 00:34:53,699
Let's roll! Hell, yeah! He didn't do nothing!
He straight-up trick.


531
00:34:53,870 --> 00:34:58,671
What's up with this? If you jacked it,
how come you got a receipt?


532
00:35:00,510 --> 00:35:01,841
I stole that too.


533
00:35:03,913 --> 00:35:06,347
What's on tap for tomorrow?


534
00:35:06,516 --> 00:35:11,317
Well, we have the 1 1 :00 with Greenpeace,
then drinks later with the offshore oil lobby.


535
00:35:11,621 --> 00:35:16,820
-How's the Brad project going?
-Smooth. He's in South Central.


536
00:35:17,794 --> 00:35:22,629
-God, is he okay?
-Oh, he's in excellent hands.


537
00:35:23,299 --> 00:35:26,234
All right. I'm sick of playing
game with you, snowflake!


538
00:35:26,403 --> 00:35:31,067
I'm gonna give you five seconds to be real
or I'm gonna beat that ass to the curb!


539
00:35:31,241 --> 00:35:34,472
-What you mean be real?
-You know what I mean. Be white!


540
00:35:34,644 --> 00:35:36,077
-Five.
-Don't do it, Bloodbath!
5


541
00:35:36,246 --> 00:35:37,804
-Four.
-Don't do it, Bloodbath!
4


542
00:35:37,981 --> 00:35:39,209
-Three.
-He gonna do it!
3


543
00:35:39,382 --> 00:35:41,009
-Two.
-Kill him! Kill him!
2


544
00:35:41,184 --> 00:35:43,049
Okay, all right!


545
00:35:43,887 --> 00:35:46,913
Okay, fellas, look,
I'm really sorry, okay?


546
00:35:47,090 --> 00:35:51,584
I don't mean to offend you, you know.
I don't mean to front or act like a thug.


547
00:35:51,761 --> 00:35:53,228
I'm sorry.


548
00:36:01,705 --> 00:36:04,196
-You buying that?
-I don't know. I can't tell.


549
00:36:05,308 --> 00:36:06,297
Me neither.


550
00:36:07,444 --> 00:36:09,139
Let's give him the test.


551
00:36:12,348 --> 00:36:15,476
How you doing, white boy?
You cool?


552
00:36:15,652 --> 00:36:17,984
Great. Fine.


553
00:36:18,154 --> 00:36:20,145
Terrific popcorn.


554
00:36:37,907 --> 00:36:43,277
Run, bitch, run!
He gonna kill you!


555
00:36:47,984 --> 00:36:49,747
I ain't lying. I ain't lying.


556
00:36:49,919 --> 00:36:53,355
Sorry, y'all, but this is who I am.
I'm just a rapper, straight up.


557
00:36:54,023 --> 00:36:57,925
-Wigga, please!
-No, for real. I can rap about anything.


558
00:36:58,094 --> 00:36:59,789
You think you got skills?


559
00:37:00,230 --> 00:37:02,960
-We gonna see about that.
-Oh, hell, yeah.


560
00:37:12,475 --> 00:37:14,534
Hey, man.
I had it up to here with you.


561
00:37:14,711 --> 00:37:17,509
You better check yourself
before you wreck yourself.


562
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:19,875
-This ain't Malibu.
-Represent.


563
00:37:20,049 --> 00:37:23,644
Oh, yeah. We gonna see what you
represent now, fool. We at the club!


564
00:37:24,420 --> 00:37:27,856
Snoop, Dre, Cube, all them.
They came in through here.


565
00:37:28,024 --> 00:37:30,686
Got something to prove
to yourself? Do it in there.


566
00:37:31,461 --> 00:37:33,622
Get in there, fool!
Go on up in there!


567
00:37:35,999 --> 00:37:39,901
-Think this is gonna do it, dude.
-Oh, we're about to get paid!


568
00:38:03,426 --> 00:38:05,257
What's cracking?


569
00:38:06,229 --> 00:38:08,026
Hey, dog.


570
00:38:08,765 --> 00:38:13,668
-Yeah, how you feeling now, Malibu?
-Like I'm home.


571
00:38:13,837 --> 00:38:17,398
Get your ass in there then, fool.
Go!


572
00:38:27,116 --> 00:38:29,846
Come on.
Let me get through here, man.


573
00:38:31,254 --> 00:38:33,347
-Yo.
-Man, I told you I didn't have--


574
00:38:35,291 --> 00:38:36,280
What's happening?


575
00:38:36,559 --> 00:38:39,460
Look, our homey--
You wanna get a young Dre next, man?


576
00:38:39,629 --> 00:38:41,927
Hell, no.
You hear what he's saying?


577
00:38:42,098 --> 00:38:44,965
Meet my boy, Ben Franklin.


578
00:38:46,469 --> 00:38:49,905
-What's his name?
-B-Rad from Malibu, player.


579
00:38:51,347 --> 00:38:53,542
B-Rad from Mal--?
You trying to get me shot?


580
00:38:53,782 --> 00:38:57,081
Hey, you met Ben Franklin's
twin brother?


581
00:39:00,589 --> 00:39:02,386
Cutter, playa.


582
00:39:02,558 --> 00:39:07,461
We're gonna bring him up. Go back and play
with each other. Come back in five minutes.


583
00:39:07,963 --> 00:39:11,558
-Playa....
-Y'all got some Will Smith back there?


584
00:39:11,734 --> 00:39:12,962
Get jiggy with it!
