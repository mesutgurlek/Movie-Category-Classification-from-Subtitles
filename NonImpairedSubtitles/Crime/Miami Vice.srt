Columbians and Russians.

80
00:08:33,529 --> 00:08:35,294

00:08:49,255 --> 00:08:51,121

It's Neptune's lucky night.

89
00:08:54,268 --> 00:08:56,390
Where's the Stevens going?

90
00:08:56,594 --> 00:08:57,839

They're looking at 92% pure.

99
00:09:49,210 --> 00:09:52,550
I like thatjunk on powder set up
in New York gold.

00:10:13,062 --> 00:10:17,049

102
00:10:17,288 --> 00:10:18,795

Pull over.

109
00:11:22,747 --> 00:11:24,345
Stop!

110
00:11:34,542 --> 00:11:37,613
Stay back you two.

111
00:11:38,571 --> 00:11:42,699
I found out they're undercover and
these guys are like you, you know.

112
00:11:42,699 --> 00:11:45,287
And French, Russians, Meagres.

00:12:00,489 --> 00:12:03,103
They took me outta that.

117
00:12:06,780 --> 00:12:09,327

118
00:12:09,532 --> 00:12:11,465
Gave up my friends.

119
00:12:11,465 --> 00:12:13,654
I don't know, it's like...

120
00:12:14,086 --> 00:12:17,854
Everything I knew... I gotta go home.

121

Got people in there.

122
00:12:24,144 --> 00:12:26,700
How do I get outta here, Martin?
- How do I know?

123
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:30,587
They won't rush out without
I get going. So...

124
00:12:30,827 --> 00:12:33,709
You all I knew...

125
00:12:34,006 --> 00:12:36,200
My god, I gotta go.

126
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:38,747
The line's up.

00:12:58,250 --> 00:13:00,047
You know.

130
00:13:03,655 --> 00:13:06,437
You don't wanna...

131
00:13:07,423 --> 00:13:10,596
No need to go home.

132
00:13:14,172 --> 00:13:16,826
They said they won't hurt him, amn.

133
00:13:16,826 --> 00:13:18,948
They left.

134
00:13:37,597 --> 00:13:39,194
Don't!!

135
00:13:58,663 --> 00:14:00,261

138
00:14:05,379 --> 00:14:06,919
Turn around.

139
00:14:06,919 --> 00:14:08,590
Turn around.

140
00:14:08,590 --> 00:14:10,556
Look, we know these people.

141
00:14:10,556 --> 00:14:13,728
Meet me in 15 minutes in Street Park.

142
00:14:39,387 --> 00:14:42,302
What the hell just happened?
- What was that?

143
00:14:42,302 --> 00:14:43,843
Possession.

144
00:14:43,843 --> 00:14:46,625
You need to talk to him.

00:14:46,988 --> 00:14:50,002
I'm Fujima, We talked on the phone.

146
00:14:50,002 --> 00:14:52,033
So this is your question?

147
00:14:52,033 --> 00:14:53,802
Yes.

00:14:59,994 --> 00:15:02,184
Calm down.

151
00:15:07,792 --> 00:15:13,188
He discovered my guy was undercover
and we don't know how.

152
00:15:13,624 --> 00:15:15,982
This wasn't any agency test force

153
00:15:15,982 --> 00:15:18,308
D.E.A.A.T. S, US custom...

154
00:15:18,308 --> 00:15:21,683
The leak could have came from
anyone unit.

155
00:15:21,683 --> 00:15:24,599
I gotta suit my operational securities
compromised.

160
00:15:35,443 --> 00:15:37,074
Why prison gang is twisted...

161
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:41,996
That's when the old lady around

00:15:58,181 --> 00:16:00,867
So you wanna exclude us?

168
00:16:00,867 --> 00:16:03,193
Identify them. Who are they?

169
00:16:03,193 --> 00:16:04,799
How they could get into this?

170
00:16:04,799 --> 00:16:07,714
How do we get into them?

171
00:16:07,911 --> 00:16:10,391
How do we get all close in personal?

172
00:16:10,630 --> 00:16:13,251
Like a buy that worthwhile.

173
00:16:13,251 --> 00:16:14,988
Sell all?

174
00:16:14,988 --> 00:16:16,364
He supplied out.

175
00:16:16,364 --> 00:16:18,165
No, we gotta study straight to the supply.

176
00:16:18,165 --> 00:16:19,869
Columbian named Jose Yero.

177
00:16:19,869 --> 00:16:21,142
Make level trafficker.

178
00:16:21,212 --> 00:16:23,473
Okay, so what about Yero?

179
00:16:23,473 --> 00:16:24,489
Can I get to that Yero?

180
00:16:24,489 --> 00:16:25,308
Possible.

181
00:16:25,308 --> 00:16:27,564
What does he need? Money or transport?
- Transport.

182
00:16:28,158 --> 00:16:30,581
They're exhausted in transportation.

183
00:16:30,779 --> 00:16:32,614
Okay.

184
00:16:32,614 --> 00:16:35,552
Do we run an undercover for Jose Yero?

185
00:16:37,987 --> 00:16:41,001
So we transport the all for anyone
of this group?

186
00:16:41,001 --> 00:16:42,835
Let's go run over for you in
1 of these groups?

187
00:16:42,835 --> 00:16:44,572
That's a question.

188
00:16:44,572 --> 00:16:46,505
The treasurer is from Heidi.

189
00:16:46,505 --> 00:16:50,984
By the... from Columbian has someone
to run Heidi until here.

190
00:16:54,106 --> 00:16:59,959
This is the frail image of someone's
go-fast boat running at the Yellow Note.

191
00:17:03,771 --> 00:17:06,061
That's all we've done.

192
00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:12,485
Alright, if they do this,

193
00:17:12,485 --> 00:17:14,419
I'd like to deputize these fella on those

194
00:17:14,419 --> 00:17:16,811
who's got for the purposes of the case.

195
00:17:16,811 --> 00:17:18,318
Fine with me.

196
00:17:18,318 --> 00:17:19,956
Because your obstacle is blonde.

197
00:17:19,956 --> 00:17:22,446
You ain't to see can know anything
about how they're doing,

198
00:17:22,446 --> 00:17:24,706
whatever things they do.

199
00:17:24,706 --> 00:17:29,194
Thay's wny I came along. Thank you.

200
00:17:29,194 --> 00:17:32,534
Sir, I don't know what you mean.

201
00:17:39,253 --> 00:17:42,392
What's your spot?

202
00:17:43,348 --> 00:17:45,739
Go-fast boat running that coast.

203
00:17:45,739 --> 00:17:48,065
I'll read out the whole clerk
one night too.

204
00:17:48,065 --> 00:17:50,422
Total darkness,

205
00:17:50,753 --> 00:17:52,874
Man, those are girls sex.

206
00:17:53,079 --> 00:17:54,585
Plus...

207
00:17:54,585 --> 00:17:56,551
Who wants 40 or 50 merges out freehouse.

208
00:17:56,551 --> 00:17:57,960
Set on a good.

209
00:17:57,960 --> 00:17:59,032
Ain't that good.

210
00:18:03,890 --> 00:18:05,912
Richard's down.

211
00:18:18,567 --> 00:18:19,977
Who woke?

212
00:18:19,977 --> 00:18:21,998
As you courier.

213
00:18:48,414 --> 00:18:50,544
Do you know how slow this is?
- They make bull shoe.

214
00:18:50,544 --> 00:18:52,833
What are you doing?! What are you doing?

215
00:19:40,703 --> 00:19:42,166
Hello.

216
00:19:42,406 --> 00:19:45,715
Hey, Nicholas. Nice, what's up?

217
00:19:45,715 --> 00:19:49,122
Everything's good. You?
- We're good, we're all good.

218
00:19:49,122 --> 00:19:51,547
As a matter of fact, we looked at the
charge of your cash flow.

219
00:19:51,547 --> 00:19:53,501
Hold on.

220
00:19:55,315 --> 00:19:58,591
Nicholas, how are you doing?
- Sonny, what's up?

221
00:19:58,591 --> 00:20:01,375
So what if sometimes is gonna
go somewhere, somewhen.

222
00:20:01,375 --> 00:20:03,243
Not to do till the future.

223
00:20:03,243 --> 00:20:06,706
What's the address that we promised?

224
00:20:07,732 --> 00:20:09,632
You called Columbia?

225
00:20:09,632 --> 00:20:12,379
Man, that's...
- Really?

226
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:16,020
He's as you see, you know.

227
00:20:16,020 --> 00:20:18,150
Columbia wrapped way in pure courage.

228
00:20:18,150 --> 00:20:20,017
You know who they are.

229
00:20:20,017 --> 00:20:22,213
They are verbally intergrated, they're...

230
00:20:22,213 --> 00:20:25,385
- You mean they walk around
like Custer and Ricsen.

231
00:20:25,554 --> 00:20:28,667
No, they formed process, produced export.

232
00:20:28,667 --> 00:20:31,451
I know. What do you mean?
- No, you see.

233
00:20:31,451 --> 00:20:34,204
That gives us attitude, a planned
negotiate's too hard

234
00:20:34,204 --> 00:20:35,842
and you never hear from them again.

235
00:20:35,842 --> 00:20:38,489
Coz these guys kill everything.

236
00:20:39,085 --> 00:20:40,789
I got to know what's his scheme.

237
00:20:40,789 --> 00:20:41,837
It's not your fucking business.

238
00:20:41,837 --> 00:20:43,082
They can come back to me, baby.

239
00:20:43,082 --> 00:20:44,687
They can't come back on you, baby.

240
00:20:44,687 --> 00:20:47,341
I'm not sure of that.
- Hey, sunshine.

241
00:20:47,341 --> 00:20:50,770
When do we call Sonny ever
liked you, huh?

242
00:20:50,945 --> 00:20:55,000
And when do you think we go told you
not to have the exactly like he said.

243
00:20:55,368 --> 00:20:57,530
I'm not saying like that.
- Yes, you're.

244
00:20:57,530 --> 00:20:59,430
Just as inverted, you know.

245
00:20:59,430 --> 00:21:01,298
Randed the sea, that's why.
- That's why what?

246
00:21:01,298 --> 00:21:03,002
We're not confused, can't deliver.

247
00:21:03,002 --> 00:21:06,311
This could go to 0, the high all
about us, like that.

248
00:21:06,311 --> 00:21:09,914
You made the 50% commission up
3 months of prosecution.

249
00:21:09,914 --> 00:21:11,749
I put you into.

250
00:21:11,749 --> 00:21:14,337
You know which is why you're
living 4-million-dollar condo

251
00:21:14,337 --> 00:21:16,073
and you questioned that?!

252
00:21:16,073 --> 00:21:17,286
Fuck that.

253
00:21:17,286 --> 00:21:18,597
I'd kick your Yankees ass,

254
00:21:18,597 --> 00:21:20,464
by going out to that goddamned battery.

255
00:21:20,464 --> 00:21:23,511
Yeah and then we can kick back
and watch more...

256
00:21:23,511 --> 00:21:26,328
After we clean this place out.
Don't you ever put anything away?

257
00:21:26,328 --> 00:21:29,801
Plus he's got a commission holds him
here for putting him holds in here.

258
00:21:29,801 --> 00:21:31,505
Anybody's looking at his old cotton game?

259
00:21:31,505 --> 00:21:33,176
I arrest looking till he shit!

260
00:21:33,176 --> 00:21:35,432
Any reason this is not good now?

261
00:21:35,731 --> 00:21:39,562
This is sound of Perry recorded...
but you're departed, buddy.

262
00:21:39,794 --> 00:21:43,725
On the carry of fest, I demand that
you're as bag and sarcastically.

263
00:21:43,725 --> 00:21:46,052
Why is this happening to me?

264
00:21:46,052 --> 00:21:48,148
Because you lead us like a crime.

265
00:21:48,148 --> 00:21:50,671
Catch the time, don't mess with crime.

266
00:21:50,671 --> 00:21:51,949
It's cool.

267
00:21:51,949 --> 00:21:54,138
I'll make a call.

268
00:22:43,975 --> 00:22:45,930
Hey, you.

269
00:22:46,105 --> 00:22:48,294
Wake up...

270
00:23:29,057 --> 00:23:32,430
I'm justjoking. Haha.

271
00:23:57,330 --> 00:24:00,704
That's pretty. That's pretty.

272
00:24:27,210 --> 00:24:29,306
I'm Trudy. Hey, Sonny.

273
00:24:29,306 --> 00:24:30,978
Hey, Trudy, how are you doing?

274
00:24:30,978 --> 00:24:32,451
Where we are?

275
00:24:32,451 --> 00:24:35,423
It's the same flat fundamental as before.

276
00:24:37,300 --> 00:24:38,674
We got...

277
00:24:39,103 --> 00:24:41,887
Do we the 500 sword, force some B wing.

278
00:24:41,887 --> 00:24:43,067
How it can be?

279
00:24:43,067 --> 00:24:46,539
Sonny, no wind posh, Chicago
and time-plus weapons

280
00:24:46,539 --> 00:24:47,948
5 outta 8.

281
00:24:47,948 --> 00:24:49,094
And jump provoke,

282
00:24:49,094 --> 00:24:51,257
How it can be when you guys hooked up.

283
00:24:51,257 --> 00:24:53,354
And then there goes the call.

284
00:24:53,354 --> 00:24:56,827
Coz presumably we're too smart
and too fast to get... in.

285
00:24:56,827 --> 00:24:59,022
What If I displace?

286
00:24:59,022 --> 00:25:02,233
It'll show up at least the valences.

287
00:25:02,233 --> 00:25:04,297
How it tells?
- I'll test it.

288
00:25:04,297 --> 00:25:05,378
LD,

289
00:25:05,378 --> 00:25:06,721
And then YPD.

290
00:25:06,721 --> 00:25:08,851
If she worked to you 4 sides down to it,

291
00:25:08,851 --> 00:25:13,297
And then she found out deep ahead to
more criminal selfs.

292
00:25:22,185 --> 00:25:25,298
'Ciudad del Este'

293
00:25:25,298 --> 00:25:29,486
'In the Tri-borders of Paraguay,
Brazil and Argentina'

294
00:27:03,387 --> 00:27:04,600
Yeah.

295
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:07,638
James, you're home?

296
00:27:08,007 --> 00:27:09,671
Let me turn 60.

297
00:27:09,875 --> 00:27:12,488
I'll negotiate the price and nursing.

298
00:27:12,922 --> 00:27:15,215
Call me until late and you're
port to print coz...

299
00:27:15,215 --> 00:27:17,312
Only when you're on the ground.

300
00:27:17,312 --> 00:27:21,467
Okay, tell me where you wanna go?

301
00:27:47,093 --> 00:27:53,573
Forcing downtown turn has increased 40
and it's under 6,000 thick...

302
00:28:29,291 --> 00:28:33,517
Why do I get the feeling everybody
knows we're here for 50 bucks out?

303
00:28:33,517 --> 00:28:37,215
Because everybody knows we're here
50 bucks out.

304
00:29:31,244 --> 00:29:33,177
Sit.

305
00:29:33,636 --> 00:29:35,467
Well, sit.

306
00:29:35,732 --> 00:29:37,922
My partner, Ricardo.

307
00:29:38,845 --> 00:29:40,386
Why, you're forgetting numb?!

308
00:29:40,386 --> 00:29:41,892
Sort of slay out.

309
00:29:41,892 --> 00:29:43,825
Yero said you wanna tie group.

310
00:29:43,825 --> 00:29:46,151
It's nice coz we got problems on
that kind of move.

311
00:29:46,151 --> 00:29:47,887
We don't tie, we fest the frantic.

312
00:29:47,887 --> 00:29:48,838
Until where?

313
00:29:48,838 --> 00:29:49,853
To New York.

314
00:29:49,853 --> 00:29:51,786
To yourself lawyer.I. L- When?

315
00:29:51,786 --> 00:29:53,556
Right now.

316
00:29:53,556 --> 00:29:55,354
It's kind of realistic.

317
00:29:56,406 --> 00:30:00,104
...We're fast. So price's right?

318
00:30:00,566 --> 00:30:02,364
Price is right.

319
00:30:02,565 --> 00:30:06,922
But how I know if you wanna
go other shit?

320
00:30:09,872 --> 00:30:11,804
What shit?

321
00:30:11,804 --> 00:30:13,311
Your business.

322
00:30:13,311 --> 00:30:15,047
How much volume do you do?

323
00:30:15,047 --> 00:30:16,653
Coz product you move,

324
00:30:16,653 --> 00:30:18,946
We work with Arcagelde Jesus Montoya.

325
00:30:18,946 --> 00:30:22,119
What if Fox knows you?

326
00:30:24,615 --> 00:30:28,502
Well, my mummy and daddy know me.

327
00:30:28,644 --> 00:30:30,151
And we don't talk about who we work with.

328
00:30:30,151 --> 00:30:35,490
Why do you come the hell up this for
business's business audition for us?!

329
00:30:38,047 --> 00:30:40,766
He knows all about us before
they called them goose.

330
00:30:40,766 --> 00:30:42,732

Who said? No horror must, I'm look on

348
00:32:10,109 --> 00:32:11,649
So let's call Crockett

00:32:11,649 --> 00:32:14,237
There make all function,
call as compoundsaly

350
00:32:14,237 --> 00:32:17,645
We were still left 14
hundred mile range and low and slow

351
00:32:17,645 --> 00:32:19,774
Black Carlyle is settle 27 to his brother

Small well and the cell
phoner when you go fast on

355
00:32:27,801 --> 00:32:29,078
So survey

356
00:32:29,078 --> 00:32:33,534
First go logistic, to pick
up below to fly in the hole

357
00:32:33,534 --> 00:32:36,680
Without your point and
our people then move it all

358
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:37,892
That's not so fair

359
00:32:37,892 --> 00:32:41,201
People will drop on people always

360
00:32:41,201 --> 00:32:43,756
You send of three girls
those person who tired

366
00:32:56,304 --> 00:32:58,139
You pick it up you drive away

367
00:32:58,139 --> 00:33:01,669
Smooth as are we do

368
00:33:02,398 --> 00:33:05,670
So you looking to move?

369
00:33:06,887 --> 00:33:11,997
No, cause you all drop low on
line, so may be that's don't work

370
00:33:11,997 --> 00:33:14,321

01:45:16,926 --> 01:45:18,891
Somebody from my side count the money

887
01:45:18,891 --> 01:45:20,497
Then we call it the dope

888

01:46:33,688 --> 01:46:37,116
Michael, show them the money

906
01:46:37,783 --> 01:46:39,847
I don't want him

907

Then come back

916
01:47:50,745 --> 01:47:52,734
Come on

917
01:47:56,249 --> 01:47:59,064
The container

918
01:48:10,763 --> 01:48:14,192
Target number 2

919
01:48:19,347 --> 01:48:21,369

What is this?

928
01:54:43,420 --> 01:54:45,441
This's a house for you

929
01:55:43,539 --> 01:55:46,645
A man named Frank is coming in a boat

930
01:55:53,073 --> 01:55:55,888
And no one'll follow you

931

01:56:25,410 --> 01:56:27,833
Yeah

936
01:56:36,581 --> 01:56:40,379
Stupid killers

937
01:58:10,511 --> 01:58:12,701
Nurse?

938
01:59:09,352 --> 01:59:11,016
The End
