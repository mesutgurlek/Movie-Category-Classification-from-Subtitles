00:00:57,340 --> 00:00:58,380
So..

3
00:01:00,810 --> 00:01:02,000
What’re you gonna do...

4
00:01:02,030 --> 00:01:04,260
for me?

5
00:01:05,180 --> 00:01:08,360
We’re gonna be straight that I’ve had it..

6
00:01:10,340 --> 00:01:13,500
What do you say to the fact that..

7
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:16,580
I’m gonna die!

8
00:01:18,020 --> 00:01:19,240
I’m gonna miss you.

9
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:22,040
Fuck that.

10
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:25,560
I won’t know about that.

11
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:30,730
I need to know...

12
00:01:32,550 --> 00:01:34,360
What’s your worth..

13
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:36,670
When I leave you nothing!

14
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:42,480
who wants the world at their feet?

15
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:47,190
it’s confusing isn’t it?

16
00:01:49,250 --> 00:01:52,960
I’m gonna do the best I can..
you can go knowing that..Ok?

17
00:01:55,380 --> 00:02:01,240
you’re me now...if you’ll have it.

18
00:05:51,460 --> 00:05:52,920
10,000..

19
00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:10,000
Player wins.

20
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:15,960
20,000

21
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:32,280
Player wins.

22
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:42,760
40,000

23
00:06:59,940 --> 00:07:01,070
Player wins.

24
00:07:06,030 --> 00:07:06,820
Again..

25
00:07:08,050 --> 00:07:08,960
Again

26
00:07:36,590 --> 00:07:38,970
Double it...make it 80,000

27
00:07:40,340 --> 00:07:42,580
Come on, Mr. Lee 
covers a lot more than that buddy..

28
00:07:42,580 --> 00:07:44,080
you must be new...double it.

29
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:58,600
80,000

30
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:37,620
I hope you paid your rent homes?!

31
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:39,800
I don’t pay rent homes.

32
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:44,060
What’s up man..you got a problem?

33
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:46,720
Issue of some kind?

34
00:08:46,940 --> 00:08:48,630
Yeah I don’t like your fuckin’ hat..

35
00:08:51,470 --> 00:08:54,150
I think you kinda wanted me to have an 
issue so I thought of that one.

36
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:57,350
I’ll see you..

37
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:58,430
outside my friend.

38
00:08:58,590 --> 00:09:00,860
Oh, we all gotta go outside sometime brother..

39
00:09:00,860 --> 00:09:02,360
this place is just a dream..

40
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:03,860
you a gambler?

41
00:09:03,860 --> 00:09:05,740
Not like you.

42
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:20,980
You wanna fuck around..or you 
wanna cut cards on my last 500?

43
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:23,460
I’ll put tend grand against your 500

44
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:25,950
I haven’t got ten grand..that’s an unequal bet.

45
00:09:26,260 --> 00:09:29,090
It’s uhm, unequal general situation.

46
00:09:30,860 --> 00:09:32,260
Well, fuck, you’ll get it then.

47
00:09:57,940 --> 00:09:59,300
That’s funny you know!

48
00:10:01,340 --> 00:10:04,020
I thought you wanted my business card!

49
00:10:10,060 --> 00:10:11,620
Congratulations

50
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:19,360
I know you...

51
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:23,260
I think you’re the kind of guy that likes to lose

52
00:10:23,330 --> 00:10:26,560
Life’s a losing proposition right? 
You might as well get it over with.

53
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:30,960
Need a stake?

54
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:33,060
You like staking losers?

55
00:10:33,140 --> 00:10:34,070
I know how you guys..

56
00:10:34,070 --> 00:10:35,700
stake people.

57
00:10:38,660 --> 00:10:40,680
Then you know everything.

58
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:24,020
Your luck is no good tonight.

59
00:11:24,020 --> 00:11:25,040
Oh, that depends..

60
00:11:26,020 --> 00:11:27,890
you give me another 10,000 credit

61
00:11:31,340 --> 00:11:33,960
You came in with 10,000 in cash..

62
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:36,080
you didn’t give it to me.

63
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:38,940
Well, this is a gambling establishment

64
00:11:47,060 --> 00:11:49,200
Have I ever not payed you?

65
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:52,100
Eventually a debt gets too big to pay.

66
00:11:56,380 --> 00:11:59,340
You owe me 240,000 dollars..

67
00:11:59,340 --> 00:12:01,660
and I want it in seven days.

68
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:21,360
Stake me 50 grand.

69
00:12:24,380 --> 00:12:25,840
At 20 points.

70
00:12:29,060 --> 00:12:30,190
Give him 50 grand.

71
00:12:33,810 --> 00:12:36,030
You make sure my man over here has your..

72
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:37,600
your digits and so forth.

73
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:44,340
I feel better about your hat.

74
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:48,480
Hehe..this mother fucker..

75
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:54,960
There’s 40,

76
00:12:54,970 --> 00:12:56,480
I’m gonna keep back 10 OK?

77
00:12:57,860 --> 00:12:59,570
You can exact the whole 50 against my vig..

78
00:12:59,580 --> 00:13:01,940
but this is a gambling establishment, 
I came to play.

79
00:13:11,470 --> 00:13:13,480
Just one blue 10,000 marker please.

80
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:32,340
No,no..

81
00:13:32,540 --> 00:13:34,680
don’t look at anyone, syou look at me just do it.

82
00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:46,900
21.

83
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:54,260
A satisfied customer.

84
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:00,960
Let’s play the two.

85
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:04,160
20,000 dollars!

86
00:14:18,220 --> 00:14:20,540
He doesn’t want you to look at him..

87
00:14:20,540 --> 00:14:22,880
just keep dealing the cards.

88
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:24,880
40,000 dollars.

89
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:32,140
I’m good.

90
00:14:38,180 --> 00:14:39,320
Take it.

91
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:42,520
Player wins.

92
00:14:48,990 --> 00:14:49,990
Don’t look at him..

93
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,990
there’s no limit..

94
00:14:53,390 --> 00:14:55,700
He wants to fuck or fight and 
I’m not interested in either..

95
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:57,540
please, just deal the cards.

96
00:14:57,800 --> 00:14:59,760
-It’s for your protection. 
-For my protection?

97
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:04,740
Fuck my protection all right, you don’t come 
here for fuckin protection from yourself..

98
00:15:04,740 --> 00:15:07,540
you come here for the fuckin opposite 
and here I am so please..

99
00:15:07,540 --> 00:15:08,180
deal the cards..

100
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:09,920
thank you.

101
00:15:10,860 --> 00:15:12,240
80,000 dollars.

102
00:15:29,740 --> 00:15:30,780
Player wins.

103
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:41,640
No more bets.

104
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:48,920
You got me feeling lucky

105
00:15:49,030 --> 00:15:50,280
I’m putting everything on black.

106
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:52,280
Red’s been comin’ up all night!

107
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:52,970
You want me to pay you now?

108
00:15:53,020 --> 00:15:54,340
-Is that want you want me to do?
-No.

109
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:55,400
Why not?

110
00:15:55,810 --> 00:15:57,840
Maybe I enjoy watching the show.

111
00:15:57,840 --> 00:15:59,900
What about ripping me off outside if I win?

112
00:15:59,980 --> 00:16:02,540
Not in that business brother.

113
00:16:02,810 --> 00:16:04,620
Everything on black.

114
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:07,010
No more bets.

115
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:23,160
19 Red.

116
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:28,080
Float me some spending money.

117
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:31,160
That’s at 20 points too.

118
00:18:03,140 --> 00:18:04,660
The first public notice...

119
00:18:04,690 --> 00:18:06,020
that was ever made of Shakespeare...

120
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:08,000
was from a grub street writer..

121
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:08,960
Robert Greene..

122
00:18:08,990 --> 00:18:10,430
who called him an upstart crow..

123
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:11,440
beautified..

124
00:18:11,620 --> 00:18:12,940
with our feathers.

125
00:18:12,940 --> 00:18:14,000
In the book...

126
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:17,280
in the book..

127
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:19,440
under that title on the board.

128
00:18:19,450 --> 00:18:20,490
Is the beautified feathers thing..

129
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:22,920
because Greene knew that 
Shakespeare was the Earl of

130
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:24,340
Oxford?

131
00:18:24,340 --> 00:18:25,930
Absolutely..

132
00:18:26,340 --> 00:18:27,360
not..

133
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:30,010
not even close..

134
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,640
the Earle of Oxford published poetry..Ok?

135
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:35,520
and it wasn’t any good..

136
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:37,360
I mean had Oxford been able 
to get a play put on..

137
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:38,020
he would’ve broken..

138
00:18:38,020 --> 00:18:39,080
 a leg to do it.

139
00:18:39,140 --> 00:18:40,760
I mean..can you think of any human being..

140
00:18:41,420 --> 00:18:43,120
that would, for any reason..

141
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:45,270
not put his name oh Hamlet?!

142
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:47,740
The Oxfordian thing...

143
00:18:47,790 --> 00:18:49,470
the anti-Strafordian thing..

144
00:18:49,980 --> 00:18:52,740
what pisses people off..about Shakespeare..

145
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:56,760
what lies behind every controversy, 
about Shakespeare..

146
00:18:57,410 --> 00:18:58,180
is rage..

147
00:18:59,260 --> 00:19:00,140
rage..

148
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:01,520
over the nature..

149
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:02,740
and unequal..

150
00:19:02,740 --> 00:19:04,510
distribution...of talent..

151
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:07,420
rage..that genius appears..

152
00:19:07,420 --> 00:19:08,570
where it appears..

153
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:10,260
for no material reason at all..

154
00:19:11,300 --> 00:19:12,600
desiring a thing..

155
00:19:13,950 --> 00:19:15,560
can not make you have it..

156
00:19:17,260 --> 00:19:18,470
now the trouble with writing...

157
00:19:18,660 --> 00:19:20,810
if I may bring it up here 
in the English department..

158
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:23,390
is we all do a little of it..

159
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:24,340
from time to time..

160
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:25,780
writing.

161
00:19:26,070 --> 00:19:27,540
And some of us..start to think...

162
00:19:27,740 --> 00:19:28,690
delusionally..

163
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:30,780
maybe with a little time..

164
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:31,880
a little peace..

165
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:32,480
a little money in the bank,

166
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:33,960
if you get that room of your own...

167
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:35,260
you think: well, shit..

168
00:19:35,580 --> 00:19:37,210
I might be a writer too..

169
00:19:37,870 --> 00:19:39,140
I mean we accept genius..

170
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:41,790
in sports..as something we cannot do..

171
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:44,460
but it’s no more likely that you 
could be a writer that..

172
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:45,190
that you could be..

173
00:19:45,190 --> 00:19:45,780
what? An Olympic..

174
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:47,180
pole Vaulter?

175
00:19:47,180 --> 00:19:48,790
Because what you have to be..

176
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,580
before you try to be a pole vaulter...

177
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:51,810
hello!

178
00:19:52,340 --> 00:19:53,800
Is a paul vaulter..no?!

179
00:19:54,250 --> 00:19:54,760
 Yeah.

180
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:55,760
You are one.

181
00:19:56,180 --> 00:19:56,920
A pole vaulter?

182
00:19:57,100 --> 00:19:57,750
A novelist.

183
00:19:57,780 --> 00:19:58,390
No I’m not..

184
00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:01,440
for me to be novelist..I would have 
to make a deal with myself..

185
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:02,860
that it was OK being a mediocrity..

186
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:05,430
 in a profession that died commercially 
in the last Century..

187
00:20:05,540 --> 00:20:07,670
All right, people do that. I’m not one of them

188
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:10,060
If you take away nothing else away from my class..

189
00:20:10,060 --> 00:20:12,400
from this experience..let it be this..

190
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:13,980
if you’re not a genius..

191
00:20:14,460 --> 00:20:16,280
don’t bother...all right?

192
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:19,380
The world needs plenty of electricians 
and a lot of them are happy.

193
00:20:19,380 --> 00:20:21,480
I’ll be fucked if I’ll be a mid-list novelist..

194
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:23,530
getting good reviews from the people I give

195
00:20:23,530 --> 00:20:25,530
good reviews to.

196
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:29,880
Let’s have a look at Dexter.

197
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:31,740
Dexter..

198
00:20:32,950 --> 00:20:34,120
An ordinary looking..

199
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:37,020
young man..with a what? size 40 jacket..

200
00:20:37,020 --> 00:20:38,530
regular features and...

201
00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:40,160
decent dentition..

202
00:20:40,340 --> 00:20:42,740
is the second ranked collegiate tennis player..

203
00:20:42,740 --> 00:20:44,490
in the United States of America..

204
00:20:45,060 --> 00:20:46,820
who did that come about Dexter?

205
00:20:46,820 --> 00:20:48,970
you come from..a tennis family?

206
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:51,320
I mean uh...

207
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:54,240
I started playing 5 years ago in high school..

208
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:56,700
cause the tennis guys had the best weed.

209
00:20:58,720 --> 00:20:59,840
After you started tennis..

210
00:20:59,940 --> 00:21:01,740
how long was it before you were 
better than everybody?

211
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:04,640
before I was better than everybody 
or before I knew it?

212
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:08,670
What happened when you noticed you 
were naturally better than everybody?

213
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:12,750
I got interested in the game..

214
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:14,770
That’s an IQ break-point brother..

215
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:16,420
right there..

216
00:21:16,420 --> 00:21:18,130
do you remember Machiavelli? 
that would’ve been

217
00:21:18,130 --> 00:21:19,050
in September.

218
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:25,060
Man...I can remember September.

219
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:26,180
All right...

220
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:28,500
Is it the game brother?

221
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:29,840
Or the money?

222
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:32,380
Ha..? Virtu or fama?

223
00:21:32,380 --> 00:21:34,600
Fame or virtue? What’re you after?

224
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:36,600
don’t go modest on me..

225
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:38,060
what do you want?

226
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:39,940
Both.

227
00:21:41,340 --> 00:21:43,030
You got ambitious, yeah?

228
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:44,720
I realized...

229
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:46,160
as I learned about the game

230
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:47,640
that I was in reach of..

231
00:21:47,710 --> 00:21:49,140
In reach of?

232
00:21:50,670 --> 00:21:52,020
In reach...of..

233
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,420
Highest level?

234
00:21:56,860 --> 00:21:58,820
Highest level...yeah.

235
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:01,080
Highest level..

236
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:02,760
but it’s still a gamble isn’t it?

237
00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:05,220
Look, I’m a literature teacher..

238
00:22:05,420 --> 00:22:06,570
I can’t write well enough to bother..

239
00:22:06,580 --> 00:22:08,680
or I just don’t bother..which ever..

240
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:10,840
which ever it is, there’ll be no 
apotheosis around here..

241
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:13,840
there’ll be no ‘vae, puto deus fio’ 
around here..

242
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:15,920
that’s what the Emperor Vespasian 
said on his death bed..

243
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:16,480
Dear me,

244
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:18,210
I think I’m becoming a God.

245
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:21,240
But you know who does write 
at the highest level?

246
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:23,010
When most of us..and even I..

247
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:26,060
even I, write barely adequately..

248
00:22:26,410 --> 00:22:27,590
do you know who it is?

249
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:30,480
in this room, who is it?

250
00:22:35,550 --> 00:22:36,630
don’t give me that look..

251
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:38,080
no, no, no, no...

252
00:22:38,340 --> 00:22:40,200
it isn’t the one who talks the most..

253
00:22:40,340 --> 00:22:42,650
you’re an NPR host..tops..OK?

254
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:45,030
The literary person in here..

255
00:22:48,530 --> 00:22:49,720
is Ms. Phillips..

256
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:53,410
she’s the least obstreperous in this room..

257
00:22:54,740 --> 00:22:55,740
the quietest..

258
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:57,640
and the only one...

259
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:00,690
who can have a real career...at letters.

260
00:23:01,430 --> 00:23:04,100
Some of you, can have one perceptually..

261
00:23:05,110 --> 00:23:06,100
only she..

262
00:23:06,770 --> 00:23:07,990
can have one in reality.

263
00:23:09,300 --> 00:23:10,760
she’s better at writing..

264
00:23:11,460 --> 00:23:13,180
than our U.S presently amateur number..

265
00:23:13,250 --> 00:23:14,280
two is at tennis.

266
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:16,310
yet she chooses to hide..

267
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:18,750
or just blend in with the rest of you..

268
00:23:19,740 --> 00:23:20,250
why?

269
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:26,700
Why is that Ms. Phillips?

270
00:23:33,820 --> 00:23:35,980
Being in the middle is the safest place to be.

271
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:39,640
Where do you come from?

272
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:42,880
Ohio!

273
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:43,270
Ohio..

274
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:45,760
parents are geniuses by any chance? 
Filthy rich?

275
00:23:47,180 --> 00:23:47,590
No.

276
00:23:48,410 --> 00:23:50,100
Well, your dad wasn’t the Earl of Oxford, was he?

277
00:23:50,260 --> 00:23:50,790
No..

278
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:52,180
No?

279
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,290
How old were you when you read?

280
00:23:56,910 --> 00:23:57,700
I was two.

281
00:23:58,690 --> 00:24:00,930
Two? Well that’s early, that’s prodigious..

282
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:03,450
any advantages? Literary home life?

283
00:24:06,110 --> 00:24:07,400
What was your father?

284
00:24:09,470 --> 00:24:11,860
Well..he worked in a factory.

285
00:24:11,860 --> 00:24:12,690
Your mother?

286
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:18,520
I..don’t..

287
00:24:19,940 --> 00:24:21,480
-What was..? 
-She was an alcoholic..

288
00:24:23,090 --> 00:24:23,920
she was insane.

289
00:24:24,810 --> 00:24:25,860
If it wasn’t your dad..

290
00:24:26,030 --> 00:24:28,020
I don’t see how this is pertinent.

291
00:24:28,430 --> 00:24:29,150
No money...

292
00:24:30,170 --> 00:24:31,670
no advantages..no peer of the realm..

293
00:24:33,220 --> 00:24:33,530
you’re not the

294
00:24:33,580 --> 00:24:35,530
Earl of Oxford are you?

295
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:36,260
No?

296
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:39,100
So why are you better

297
00:24:39,140 --> 00:24:40,160
than the rest of us?

298
00:24:44,190 --> 00:24:45,170
No you look at me..

299
00:24:48,290 --> 00:24:49,470
you are better than the rest of us..

300
00:24:49,470 --> 00:24:51,300
if no one told you yet..that you’re a 
genius and an artist..

301
00:24:51,540 --> 00:24:52,390
let me be the first..

302
00:24:52,750 --> 00:24:54,950
Ok, I don’t know if you can say that...

303
00:24:55,460 --> 00:24:56,740
cause I think it’s subjective man

304
00:24:57,260 --> 00:24:59,120
I mean we all have something to offer.

305
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:00,920
Bullshit...

306
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:03,110
genius is magical not material..

307
00:25:03,270 --> 00:25:06,470
if you don’t have the magic, no 
amount of wishing will make it so..

308
00:25:06,820 --> 00:25:07,520
Ms. Phillips..

309
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:10,040
if you plan to continue to come to my class..

310
00:25:10,100 --> 00:25:11,460
you sit in the front were you belong..

311
00:25:11,460 --> 00:25:12,540
or don’t bother showing up.

312
00:25:13,140 --> 00:25:13,950
Have a nice day.

313
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:29,120
May I have a word?

314
00:25:30,350 --> 00:25:31,230
More words..?

315
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:34,000
The athletic department has asked how...

316
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,050
a certain person is doing..

317
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:37,870
You mean the certain person 
who can not stay off his phone?

318
00:25:38,340 --> 00:25:39,860
I mean you do realize that this..

319
00:25:39,860 --> 00:25:41,620
certain person cannot write at a high school level..

320
00:25:41,630 --> 00:25:43,300
never mind a collegial one..

321
00:25:43,300 --> 00:25:44,940
but that doesn’t matter thought right? 
I mean come on

322
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:47,360
half the entenured faculty would be 
flogged to death for idiocy..

323
00:25:47,370 --> 00:25:49,760
in any grammar school in 
any previous Century so..

324
00:25:49,780 --> 00:25:50,740
why would it matter?

325
00:25:51,620 --> 00:25:52,690
Why do you care about that?

326
00:25:52,710 --> 00:25:53,970
If..you don’t care about anything?

327
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:56,140
You’re probably right.

328
00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:22,360
I’ll never beat you Mr. Dexter...

329
00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:26,930
but if you ever give me a point 
I cannot fire you.

330
00:27:35,780 --> 00:27:36,990
Good luck in the finals.

331
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:37,930
Thank you ma'am.

332
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:43,600
Why do you need the money?

333
00:27:45,820 --> 00:27:47,900
If you’re escaping for a purpose, 
maybe I’d buy it.

334
00:27:48,170 --> 00:27:50,350
Going on as I am is the only thing I’ve got.

335
00:27:50,660 --> 00:27:51,710
That’s sophistical...

336
00:27:52,830 --> 00:27:54,040
it’s beneath you...

337
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:56,240
I think you would agree that...

338
00:27:56,380 --> 00:27:57,390
modification...

339
00:27:58,070 --> 00:27:58,750
is possible.

340
00:27:58,940 --> 00:27:59,520
Do you?

341
00:28:03,750 --> 00:28:05,230
I know you’re in real trouble..

342
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:09,620
I know this is all connected to 
your grand father’s death..

343
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:12,240
but you’re not narcissistic enough to..

344
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:14,130
put on a show..nor are you an adolescent..

345
00:28:14,780 --> 00:28:17,570
and I think it goes without saying 
that you’r far from stupid..

346
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:19,280
you’re my son..

347
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:21,640
but you have to understand..

348
00:28:23,140 --> 00:28:24,480
I’ve said good bye before..

349
00:28:24,560 --> 00:28:25,600
to people I love.

350
00:28:25,740 --> 00:28:27,530
Yeah whatever did happen to dad?

351
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:34,070
I’ve done it many, many times...

352
00:28:35,430 --> 00:28:37,800
I don’t want to know the nature of your problem..

353
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:39,850
I just want you to not have it anymore..

354
00:28:44,500 --> 00:28:46,020
I’m not giving you anymore.

355
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:43,500
-You Jim Bennett? 
-Yeah.

356
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:44,740
Get in.

357
00:29:58,340 --> 00:29:59,180
Big Ernie.

358
00:30:03,210 --> 00:30:04,440
You’re not that big.

359
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:08,200
Not talking about my jacket brother.

360
00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:13,480
You know with all due respect I’m 
not interested in you Johnson..so..

361
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:14,220
Sure you are..

362
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:17,180
it has been so since the Greeks.

363
00:30:19,940 --> 00:30:23,900
I gotta tell you..I can’t argue with that I guess.

364
00:30:27,140 --> 00:30:29,630
A friend of mine says that you are a teacher.

365
00:30:31,850 --> 00:30:33,560
I’m a social professor.

366
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:37,580
The amount of cash you want...

367
00:30:37,580 --> 00:30:40,040
is more than I am 
ordinarily disposed to loan out..

368
00:30:40,040 --> 00:30:42,140
unless, say, you’re a medium size country..

369
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:42,900
with the ability..

370
00:30:42,900 --> 00:30:45,730
to raise taxes under the 
threat of military force..

371
00:30:45,850 --> 00:30:46,710
or..

372
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:48,860
a Euro trash coke head who has a father..

373
00:30:48,860 --> 00:30:50,060
that could be squeezed

374
00:30:50,070 --> 00:30:51,160
after the little prick’s..

375
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:54,560
micro-budget sci-fi film 
doesn’t get picked up at Sundance..

376
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:55,670
are you following me?

377
00:30:57,420 --> 00:30:59,320
You have family that could be squeezed?

378
00:30:59,390 --> 00:31:00,590
I’m saying that rhetorically.

379
00:31:00,670 --> 00:31:03,340
Let’s deal with this as gentlemen who 
understand each other please?

380
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:03,960
No..

381
00:31:05,420 --> 00:31:07,910
I need for us to treat each other like 
we’re not gentlemen..

382
00:31:07,980 --> 00:31:09,660
and that we’re very, very stupid.

383
00:31:10,460 --> 00:31:10,810
OK..

384
00:31:11,470 --> 00:31:14,330
there’s no family, there’s never any family.

385
00:31:14,610 --> 00:31:18,220
What do you make..a 100? 
150 a year? 200 before taxes?

386
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:22,580
What’s wrong with you? you got brain damage?

387
00:31:22,670 --> 00:31:24,410
Some fundamental disability?

388
00:31:24,540 --> 00:31:25,870
200 is a monk..

389
00:31:26,220 --> 00:31:27,870
and you, a monk..

390
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:29,390
owe that Korean son of a bitch...

391
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:31,870
that prince of fuckin’ darkness, 
that much already..

392
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:34,960
and then another fifty, excluding the vig..

393
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:35,970
to Neville Baraka..

394
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:37,630
who will kill you because when..

395
00:31:37,630 --> 00:31:38,740
you cut cards..

396
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:40,850
he got the king of spades, and you laughed at him.

397
00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:42,920
You’re pretty well informed.

398
00:31:42,990 --> 00:31:45,440
You borrowed fifty K from a very dangerous man..

399
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:47,010
after he already was going to kill you.

400
00:31:47,140 --> 00:31:48,130
Yes I did.

401
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:52,110
Birth, education, intelligence, talent, looks..

402
00:31:52,530 --> 00:31:53,300
family money..

403
00:31:53,300 --> 00:31:55,850
has all this been some real comprehensive fuckin’

404
00:31:55,860 --> 00:31:56,780
burden for you?

405
00:31:58,760 --> 00:31:59,980
I see two problems..

406
00:32:01,150 --> 00:32:01,780
One..

407
00:32:01,780 --> 00:32:03,770
the world at his feet, in this town..

408
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:07,280
and he’s a fuckin’ monk because 
apparently..Fuck it.

409
00:32:07,740 --> 00:32:08,540
Two..

410
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:10,480
he wants to dance with the devil..

411
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:12,320
for some unspecified reason therefore..

412
00:32:12,330 --> 00:32:14,260
owes money to Korean murderers..

413
00:32:14,260 --> 00:32:15,720
and talks about a schwarzer’s hat..

414
00:32:15,740 --> 00:32:17,080
in a place where he can get killed..

415
00:32:17,080 --> 00:32:19,340
and they merely drop your 
body up the Angeles Crest..

416
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:21,660
Three, he wants to borrow a quarter of 
a million dollars..

417
00:32:21,660 --> 00:32:24,340
to pay off debts which he will, in fact, 
not pay off..

418
00:32:24,520 --> 00:32:26,840
because, to go back to point two...

419
00:32:26,910 --> 00:32:28,220
he’s suicidal.

420
00:32:29,350 --> 00:32:31,610
Just let me know 
what you can do for me all right?

421
00:32:33,070 --> 00:32:36,000
If I help you consolidate those debts 
even at a lesser load..

422
00:32:36,060 --> 00:32:39,390
do you think I would be anyone 
you wanna fuck up the ass?

423
00:32:39,530 --> 00:32:41,930
am I likelier to be fucked up the ass?

424
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:43,710
Less likely I imagine.

425
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:47,740
Listen to me, listen to me..

426
00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:49,660
I’m not your doctor..

427
00:32:50,180 --> 00:32:52,140
I’m not your cognitive therapist..

428
00:32:52,190 --> 00:32:53,520
but let me be your uncle..

429
00:32:53,980 --> 00:32:56,200
you have to pay 10 percent a week.

430
00:32:56,350 --> 00:32:57,450
I know what I have to do.

431
00:32:57,570 --> 00:32:59,850
Where are you gonna get my money? 
-I'll get the money.

432
00:33:00,260 --> 00:33:01,320
How much you want?

433
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,620
I’m 260,000 dollars all in.

434
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:06,330
When's the last time you had money in your hand..

435
00:33:06,330 --> 00:33:07,420
to pay a debt..and payed it?

436
00:33:08,180 --> 00:33:09,780
Don’t fuck with me..

437
00:33:09,990 --> 00:33:11,990
this will be your first time when you pay. 
Am I right?

438
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:14,530
That’s right.

439
00:33:17,070 --> 00:33:18,130
We’re not done..

440
00:33:24,910 --> 00:33:26,760
I need something from you..

441
00:33:29,210 --> 00:33:30,560
What? Collateral?

442
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:34,120
No..I need you to tell me..

443
00:33:35,090 --> 00:33:38,360
I need this money because 
I’m a scumbag gambler..

444
00:33:39,040 --> 00:33:42,380
I’m a scumbag gambler 
who is  drowning in his own shit...

445
00:33:42,380 --> 00:33:44,460
that’s the kind of man I am Frank..

446
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:46,900
and I want you..to loan me..

447
00:33:46,900 --> 00:33:49,500
a dying suicidal asshole..

448
00:33:49,500 --> 00:33:50,600
a lot of money.

449
00:33:51,020 --> 00:33:53,280
That’s too much to remember to repeat it.

450
00:33:53,740 --> 00:33:55,460
I’ll make it simple for you..

451
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:58,580
you want this money..tell me I am not a man.

452
00:34:00,010 --> 00:34:01,040
Say it..

453
00:34:02,460 --> 00:34:04,050
say I am not a man.

454
00:34:31,650 --> 00:34:31,870
Yes..?

455
00:34:36,250 --> 00:34:38,020
Did you mean what you said?

456
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:40,270
About me having talent?

457
00:34:43,120 --> 00:34:45,130
Is there something you don’t get about A++

458
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:46,120
see me?

459
00:34:49,160 --> 00:34:50,820
Then you never see me..

460
00:34:55,460 --> 00:34:56,330
Yeah well,

461
00:34:57,590 --> 00:34:58,780
I don’t wanna see you.

462
00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:02,570
Because I’ve seen you in your other life?

463
00:35:04,930 --> 00:35:05,550
No..

464
00:35:07,550 --> 00:35:08,700
No it isn’t that.

465
00:35:16,350 --> 00:35:16,960
Oh.

466
00:35:19,290 --> 00:35:21,120
Do you know why I’m in trouble here?

467
00:35:22,010 --> 00:35:23,050
Because I tell the truth..

468
00:35:23,380 --> 00:35:24,000
It’s what I do..

469
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:27,830
Do want me to split the atoms..
succumb to velocity and tell you the truth..?

470
00:35:28,180 --> 00:35:29,510
Physiology doesn’t lie..

471
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:30,780
everything else does..

472
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:31,920
everybody else does..

473
00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:33,640
physiology doesn’t.

474
00:35:36,100 --> 00:35:37,500
It’s post intellectual..

475
00:35:38,390 --> 00:35:40,160
And what are you trying to say to me?

476
00:35:40,450 --> 00:35:41,840
I’m not in any position to say anything.

477
00:35:42,020 --> 00:35:42,750
Try.

478
00:35:43,340 --> 00:35:44,320
Why should I try?

479
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:46,080
Because what you said before.

480
00:35:46,540 --> 00:35:47,480
I need you to leave..

481
00:35:48,230 --> 00:35:49,520
Right now..this is not happening..

482
00:35:49,540 --> 00:35:50,790
I’m serious go..you have to go.

483
00:36:08,590 --> 00:36:09,700
I want you to sign this.

484
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:10,800
Absolutely fuckin’ not

485
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:13,160
I want you..to fuckin’ sign it.

486
00:36:13,240 --> 00:36:14,660
Look, I’m not being dramatic ok?

487
00:36:14,660 --> 00:36:15,440
But that was somebody else.

488
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:16,860
You are being dramatic.

489
00:36:16,970 --> 00:36:18,900
which is fine because the novel is basically OK..

490
00:36:18,900 --> 00:36:20,840
but that’s what you are..a dramatist.

491
00:36:21,740 --> 00:36:23,300
did you write this because you believed in it...

492
00:36:23,300 --> 00:36:25,420
or because you thought that’s 
what people wanted?

493
00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:36,490
Well, what do you propose we move on to?

494
00:36:38,950 --> 00:36:39,510
When was..

495
00:36:39,540 --> 00:36:42,880
the last time that somebody told 
you that you’re a genius?

496
00:36:43,240 --> 00:36:44,770
We’re not having this conversation.

497
00:36:45,340 --> 00:36:46,970
I wanna go to a restaurant.

498
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:50,710
There’s a whole bunch of things 
I don’t do anymore..

499
00:36:50,750 --> 00:36:53,460
and that’s...kind of up there.

500
00:38:23,410 --> 00:38:25,950
Guy with no money speaking, 
how may I direct your call?

501
00:38:27,030 --> 00:38:28,240
I’m reading your book.

502
00:38:31,270 --> 00:38:32,050
not bad.

503
00:38:32,450 --> 00:38:33,250
Ah..If you wanna get into..

504
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:35,880
producing, there’s only about a hundred grand 
against it in Warner Brothers..

505
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:37,860
good script..I know the guy who did.

506
00:38:38,980 --> 00:38:40,420
It’s a Indie at best.

507
00:38:40,510 --> 00:38:43,760
Yeah...yeah that’s what they thought.

508
00:38:43,880 --> 00:38:46,040
I heard you went to little Franky for some money..

509
00:38:46,220 --> 00:38:47,130
he wouldn’t loan it to you.

510
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:50,730
Well you heard wrong, because he did try 
to loan it to me and I didn't take it.

511
00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:52,750
You didn’t like the terms?

512
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:55,660
No, the terms weren’t acceptable.

513
00:38:56,680 --> 00:38:58,060
But you’re into me..

514
00:38:58,690 --> 00:39:00,940
and I ain’t Fannie May..ain’t no bail outs.

515
00:39:01,240 --> 00:39:03,320
Oh yeah, then why did you loan me the money?

516
00:39:04,090 --> 00:39:06,510
A gamble between two players who like to play...

517
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:07,360
me and you.

518
00:39:08,170 --> 00:39:09,280
Double header?

519
00:39:10,650 --> 00:39:12,330
Let me give you a bit of advice here.

520
00:39:12,410 --> 00:39:13,030
What’s that?

521
00:39:13,340 --> 00:39:16,170
You owe somebody money..you don’t fuck around..

522
00:39:17,300 --> 00:39:18,760
I want the money by Monday...

523
00:39:19,060 --> 00:39:21,790
I’ll take that car of yours..
consider it collateral.

524
00:39:25,180 --> 00:39:26,230
In the Stranger..

525
00:39:30,300 --> 00:39:32,700
Camus' protagonist fires five shots..

526
00:39:33,630 --> 00:39:35,380
the sixth shot of the revolver..

527
00:39:35,380 --> 00:39:37,760
he is reserving symbolically for himself...

528
00:39:39,260 --> 00:39:40,840
noticing that, originally..

529
00:39:42,570 --> 00:39:43,720
is why I’m here now...

530
00:39:47,790 --> 00:39:48,330
Lamar...

531
00:39:49,740 --> 00:39:50,390
Lamar..

532
00:39:52,050 --> 00:39:53,020
you’re taking notes?

533
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:53,510
or you’re texting?

534
00:39:54,410 --> 00:39:56,330
You have anything you wanna add?

535
00:39:57,730 --> 00:39:58,940
What do you think?

536
00:40:01,080 --> 00:40:02,150
All right...well..

537
00:40:02,770 --> 00:40:04,560
maybe the dude had a hammer..

538
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:06,820
on an empty chamber or something..

539
00:40:06,820 --> 00:40:09,030
or a weird French piece that only took five!

540
00:40:14,050 --> 00:40:16,460
No, my idea works better if he has a full six.

541
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:21,660
I don’t understand suicide.

542
00:40:24,890 --> 00:40:26,540
Well that’s because you’re happy.

543
00:40:26,890 --> 00:40:28,400
You got a BMW, M1..

544
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:30,230
how are you unhappy?

545
00:40:30,660 --> 00:40:31,690
Do I look happy?

546
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:34,740
I’m not happy.

547
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:37,370
You know why?

548
00:40:39,860 --> 00:40:41,800
Because I’m teaching the modern novel..

549
00:40:43,620 --> 00:40:45,200
to a class room full of students..

550
00:40:45,950 --> 00:40:46,960
who don’t give a fuck..

551
00:40:50,690 --> 00:40:51,260
you know..

552
00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:53,930
we really should’ve gone for American realism..

553
00:40:54,980 --> 00:40:56,880
I mean let’s have more fuckin’ realism..

554
00:40:58,030 --> 00:41:00,110
I mean shouldn’t I be teaching you things?

555
00:41:00,770 --> 00:41:01,400
No, I should..

556
00:41:01,510 --> 00:41:02,940
I mean I know all you’re here for..

557
00:41:02,950 --> 00:41:03,770
is a sufficiency..

558
00:41:03,770 --> 00:41:06,400
of English credits but Jesus...if I'm here..

559
00:41:06,660 --> 00:41:08,360
I ought to be doing better...right?

560
00:41:16,270 --> 00:41:17,520
I could stand here..

561
00:41:18,360 --> 00:41:19,600
stark naked..

562
00:41:20,350 --> 00:41:21,740
and I could yell as loud as I want..

563
00:41:22,580 --> 00:41:23,820
and nobody cares.

564
00:41:25,250 --> 00:41:27,120
When you leave here today, call your parents..

565
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:29,860
and tell them you apologize..

566
00:41:30,060 --> 00:41:31,000
for wasting their time..

567
00:41:31,060 --> 00:41:32,360
and more importantly wasting their money..

568
00:41:32,380 --> 00:41:34,470
sitting in this classroom learning absolutely..

569
00:41:34,570 --> 00:41:34,990
nothing.

570
00:41:36,380 --> 00:41:38,530
let’s start fresh, lets clean 
the slate right now..

571
00:41:39,270 --> 00:41:40,860
Let me introduce myself..

572
00:41:42,370 --> 00:41:43,800
my name is James Bennett..

573
00:41:46,440 --> 00:41:48,230
I’m here pretending to teach..

574
00:41:48,650 --> 00:41:50,630
and you’ve been here pretending to learn..

575
00:41:51,650 --> 00:41:53,290
this is what I want you to do...

576
00:41:53,480 --> 00:41:54,280
write down..

577
00:41:54,830 --> 00:41:57,610
that he saves the sixth shot 
symbolically for himself...

578
00:41:58,320 --> 00:42:00,540
you’re not gonna find a reference anywhere..ok?

579
00:42:00,540 --> 00:42:02,640
because I am the only one who 
thought of it all right..

580
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:03,980
It’s in a monograph somewhere...

581
00:42:03,980 --> 00:42:05,320
that got me into this situation..

582
00:42:05,450 --> 00:42:08,270
where I can’t..so I pretend to teach..

583
00:42:08,550 --> 00:42:10,000
and you pretend to learn..

584
00:42:10,060 --> 00:42:10,720
Lamar...!

585
00:42:10,780 --> 00:42:12,500
the fucking...phone.

586
00:42:17,270 --> 00:42:19,920
you stay after...everybody else...just go.

587
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:22,920
go...go.

588
00:42:35,080 --> 00:42:36,050
What do I have to do?

589
00:42:37,700 --> 00:42:39,010
What do I do? Get ten guys...

590
00:42:39,060 --> 00:42:40,720
some weapons..take out a life insurance policy ..

591
00:42:40,740 --> 00:42:42,680
trying to put that phone up your ass? 
Because I will.

592
00:42:42,970 --> 00:42:44,540
I need you to pay attention..

593
00:42:45,390 --> 00:42:47,490
Is that too much to ask for? Huh?

594
00:42:47,870 --> 00:42:50,650
You come into this class, and you pay 
attention for a fuckin’ hour..

595
00:42:51,520 --> 00:42:54,280
You know..they expect me 
to pass you regardless..

596
00:42:54,620 --> 00:42:57,200
regardless..they want me to give 
you a passing grade..

597
00:42:57,200 --> 00:42:58,360
so you can keep going out there..

598
00:42:58,410 --> 00:42:59,760
and bouncing that basketball around..

599
00:43:00,080 --> 00:43:02,340
I need you to put the phone down..for a second.

600
00:43:02,450 --> 00:43:04,190
You’re not the only one loosing his shit..

601
00:43:06,420 --> 00:43:08,240
I was gonna talk to you anyway...

602
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:11,020
cause I can’t talk to anybody over there..

603
00:43:11,070 --> 00:43:13,090
cause all they’re gonna say 
is what keeps me in line..

604
00:43:13,090 --> 00:43:14,030
for what they want me to be...

605
00:43:14,520 --> 00:43:16,760
which is Lamar, but..I don’t wanna be Lamar..

606
00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:17,800
I done all that..

607
00:43:18,290 --> 00:43:21,210
I just wanna be another fuckin’ dude, 
in the Universe..

608
00:43:21,360 --> 00:43:22,830
and do more than just being Lamar.

609
00:43:24,150 --> 00:43:25,620
Yeah, I know all about it.

610
00:43:25,620 --> 00:43:27,320
But the fuckin’ coach don’t know about it..

611
00:43:27,480 --> 00:43:29,040
There's more than being Lamar..

612
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:32,460
I stick with this shit man I’d go out of my mind...

613
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:34,840
probably be one of those brothers 
that talks to himself..

614
00:43:34,900 --> 00:43:37,090
in like third person and shit...talk about how..

615
00:43:37,260 --> 00:43:39,250
Lamar is at ease with his celebrity..

616
00:43:39,640 --> 00:43:41,580
they got me in a box where they want me..

617
00:43:42,540 --> 00:43:44,220
Trapped by talent...imagine that.

618
00:43:44,650 --> 00:43:45,790
You know man...in here..

619
00:43:45,860 --> 00:43:48,480
it’s all existential situations and shit..

620
00:43:48,600 --> 00:43:50,570
no matter what you start talking about..

621
00:43:50,680 --> 00:43:52,860
you come around to be free or not to be free...

622
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:54,810
how to be yourself..or nothing at all.

623
00:43:55,080 --> 00:43:56,840
Is that what I talk about, all or nothing?

624
00:43:56,840 --> 00:43:58,370
I never heard talking about anything else..

625
00:43:58,500 --> 00:43:59,580
but to be or not to be...

626
00:43:59,990 --> 00:44:01,840
and I’ve had four classes with you.

627
00:44:02,910 --> 00:44:04,010
Maybe you got me.

628
00:44:14,510 --> 00:44:15,580
I need to go pro.

629
00:44:16,650 --> 00:44:19,040
I don’t think you’re 
gonna have any trouble Lamar.

630
00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:21,740
I don’t mean later, I mean now..I need to go pro..

631
00:44:25,290 --> 00:44:26,410
I all ready got a knee.

632
00:44:28,480 --> 00:44:30,000
nobody knows about it cause I don’t 
say anything...

633
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:30,920
but I already got a knee...

634
00:44:32,140 --> 00:44:33,440
see I’m not gonna sit here and tell you that...

635
00:44:33,840 --> 00:44:35,470
my mom needs an operation...

636
00:44:35,680 --> 00:44:37,470
or my little sister has Spina Bifida...

637
00:44:37,940 --> 00:44:39,960
but I am gonna tell you that I got a knee...

638
00:44:40,340 --> 00:44:41,400
I got a knee...

639
00:44:41,670 --> 00:44:42,580
I’m a junior...

640
00:44:42,990 --> 00:44:46,220
and whenever I tell somebody I don’t wanna 
play college ball my senior year..

641
00:44:46,340 --> 00:44:47,620
nobody listens to me...

642
00:44:48,410 --> 00:44:51,400
it’s like I’m talking Chinese on 
another fuckin’ planet...

643
00:44:52,210 --> 00:44:53,300
and then the coach tells me..

644
00:44:53,320 --> 00:44:54,730
I don’t have the market value I would have...

645
00:44:54,740 --> 00:44:55,950
if I don’t play on my senior year..

646
00:44:56,920 --> 00:44:59,300
but what he doesn’t know is that 
I got a fuckin’ knee...

647
00:45:00,010 --> 00:45:01,970
You have it looked at it 
away from the department?

648
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:03,520
Yeah.

649
00:46:12,540 --> 00:46:13,960
Did you have money on the game?

650
00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:16,520
Why would I have money on the game?

651
00:46:16,690 --> 00:46:18,000
He’s a student of mine...

652
00:46:18,100 --> 00:46:19,280
that’s unethical all right..

653
00:46:19,280 --> 00:46:20,980
I would not bet on a student of mine..

654
00:46:20,980 --> 00:46:22,560
you think I would do something like that?

655
00:46:22,560 --> 00:46:24,860
I would never do anything like that..OK?

656
00:46:25,280 --> 00:46:27,700
What kind of a person do you think I am?

657
00:46:27,980 --> 00:46:29,440
Do I have money on the game?!

658
00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:37,870
Is he good at English?

659
00:46:39,400 --> 00:46:40,610
No, he’s not.

660
00:46:46,280 --> 00:46:48,020
How bad is this trouble you’re in?

661
00:46:49,070 --> 00:46:50,140
I’m always in trouble.

662
00:46:50,140 --> 00:46:51,190
No, I mean...

663
00:46:52,200 --> 00:46:53,450
do you still need money?

664
00:46:53,920 --> 00:46:54,440
No.

665
00:46:54,780 --> 00:46:55,690
Truthfully?

666
00:46:56,100 --> 00:46:57,220
Truthfully.

667
00:46:58,410 --> 00:47:00,510
I never know when to believe you anymore..

668
00:47:01,570 --> 00:47:03,790
perhaps I should believe...the gangster who..

669
00:47:03,840 --> 00:47:05,390
phoned my home...

670
00:47:18,810 --> 00:47:19,750
what’s that?

671
00:47:21,210 --> 00:47:22,030
What I owe.

672
00:47:26,220 --> 00:47:28,470
Jesus...how is this possible?

673
00:47:28,820 --> 00:47:30,310
Same as your marriage..I lost.

674
00:47:30,570 --> 00:47:33,220
No, marriage is in the real world..

675
00:47:34,570 --> 00:47:36,170
it’s not a game of chance.

676
00:47:36,600 --> 00:47:37,960
Now you’re talking crazy.

677
00:47:38,470 --> 00:47:40,410
What will they do to you if you don’t pay?

678
00:47:40,910 --> 00:47:42,250
Break every bone on my body...

679
00:47:42,360 --> 00:47:43,260
Go after the family...

680
00:47:49,220 --> 00:47:50,630
I can’t help doing this...

681
00:47:51,180 --> 00:47:53,190
I don’t believe this is a disease..

682
00:47:53,680 --> 00:47:56,220
Well I just had a considerable 
conversation about character...

683
00:47:56,220 --> 00:47:58,220
and there’s gonna be a moment 
when I want something again...

684
00:47:58,220 --> 00:48:00,640
when I won’t allow myself to be 
seen i this condition..

685
00:48:00,640 --> 00:48:01,900
but it’s not now..

686
00:48:01,900 --> 00:48:03,180
and it’s not up to you...

687
00:48:03,180 --> 00:48:05,640
or anything you..or anybody else fuckin’ says ok?

688
00:48:16,440 --> 00:48:17,600
Are you degraded enough ..

689
00:48:17,680 --> 00:48:19,600
to come with your mother to the bank?

690
00:48:34,280 --> 00:48:36,140
In cases like this, I have to ask...

691
00:48:36,140 --> 00:48:37,390
is everything ok?

692
00:48:37,880 --> 00:48:38,900
Nothing is ok..

693
00:48:40,030 --> 00:48:42,560
when someone needs 
that amount of money in cash...

694
00:48:44,090 --> 00:48:47,080
but it’s my money..and it’s none of 
your goddamn business.

695
00:48:49,510 --> 00:48:50,480
Are you a relation?

696
00:48:51,270 --> 00:48:52,480
This is my son.

697
00:48:53,300 --> 00:48:55,260
Either you can’t see the uncanny resemblance..

698
00:48:55,260 --> 00:48:56,980
or you’re implying 
she’s under duress or something.

699
00:48:57,330 --> 00:48:58,190
Should I be?

700
00:48:58,510 --> 00:48:59,150
Look dear...

701
00:49:00,740 --> 00:49:03,220
it’s my money...and there’s plenty of it...

702
00:49:05,110 --> 00:49:07,130
and don’t even start to tell me that all..

703
00:49:07,200 --> 00:49:09,130
this bullshit is for my protection..

704
00:49:09,170 --> 00:49:10,450
because that is understood...

705
00:49:10,890 --> 00:49:12,640
now you have the withdrawal slip...

706
00:49:14,260 --> 00:49:16,470
here..is my I.D...

707
00:49:18,480 --> 00:49:19,920
there are sufficient funds...

708
00:49:20,070 --> 00:49:22,160
my family has been with this bank...

709
00:49:22,490 --> 00:49:24,450
since my father in law started it...

710
00:49:25,590 --> 00:49:26,530
now what I want...

711
00:49:27,280 --> 00:49:29,780
is 260,000 dollars...

712
00:49:30,310 --> 00:49:31,480
in cash.

713
00:49:32,500 --> 00:49:34,010
Are you sure you want that in cash?

714
00:49:36,890 --> 00:49:39,720
Cash.....cash.

715
00:49:40,240 --> 00:49:41,280
I’m sorry. I’m gonna ask for..

716
00:49:41,650 --> 00:49:42,210
What?

717
00:49:42,470 --> 00:49:44,370
For a second piece of identification...

718
00:49:45,640 --> 00:49:46,880
it’s for your own protection.

719
00:49:53,800 --> 00:49:55,100
This is the last of it...

720
00:49:55,810 --> 00:49:58,090
if I ever have to hear 
about your problems again...

721
00:49:58,450 --> 00:50:00,730
I will never see you again..do you understand?

722
00:50:04,660 --> 00:50:05,590
I need you to..

723
00:50:05,660 --> 00:50:07,170
fuckin’ understand that...

724
00:50:10,160 --> 00:50:11,410
am I embarrassing you?

725
00:50:11,930 --> 00:50:13,220
You wanna just take the money?

726
00:50:14,040 --> 00:50:15,830
You wanna just take the money and go?

727
00:50:17,430 --> 00:50:18,840
Even if I say goodbye...

728
00:50:19,290 --> 00:50:20,420
and consider it..

729
00:50:20,640 --> 00:50:22,260
cheap to be rid of you?

730
00:50:23,530 --> 00:50:25,480
Yeah, I wanna take the money and go.

731
00:52:07,400 --> 00:52:08,040
Hey.

732
00:52:11,900 --> 00:52:12,320
Hey.

733
00:52:14,840 --> 00:52:17,590
If I have to pull you into an 
inappropriate relationship..

734
00:52:17,590 --> 00:52:19,850
to get you out of your job..I’m ready to go.

735
00:52:33,220 --> 00:52:34,090
So am I.

736
00:52:54,230 --> 00:52:55,720
If I told you that I’m not a gambler...?

737
00:52:59,240 --> 00:53:01,020
what if you saw me with a needle in my arm..

738
00:53:01,020 --> 00:53:03,020
and I told you that I’m not a junkie?

739
00:53:03,930 --> 00:53:06,400
I saw you be a professor 
and I know you’re not one of those.

740
00:53:11,630 --> 00:53:12,860
It’s good to come out here...

741
00:53:13,320 --> 00:53:13,810
it’s good.

742
00:53:18,100 --> 00:53:20,160
I come out here because it makes feel alive.

743
00:53:20,220 --> 00:53:23,300
No..no..no, not good enough...

744
00:53:23,690 --> 00:53:24,540
there is something else...

745
00:53:24,540 --> 00:53:25,670
I don’t know quite what it is...

746
00:53:25,670 --> 00:53:27,690
I know a lot, but I don’t fuckin’ know that..

747
00:53:30,900 --> 00:53:33,060
I always sat on a blanket 
in the middle of nowhere..

748
00:53:33,060 --> 00:53:35,520
with nothing around me, 
with infinite possibilities..

749
00:53:35,580 --> 00:53:37,520
and it’s bullshit, and I’m sick of it.

750
00:53:39,830 --> 00:53:43,040
You are the perfect example 
of how a person can start off..

751
00:53:43,040 --> 00:53:45,040
with no problems what so ever...

752
00:53:45,130 --> 00:53:47,780
and then go out of their way to 
make sure they have all of them.

753
00:53:51,120 --> 00:53:52,740
There’s no relative degree of suffering..

754
00:53:52,760 --> 00:53:54,580
what, you want me to talk about my problems?

755
00:53:54,700 --> 00:53:57,780
I don’t like people with problems..
or the fuckin’ vanity to bring them up...

756
00:53:58,450 --> 00:53:59,780
that’s where I’m from...

757
00:54:04,080 --> 00:54:05,140
I’m like my mother...

758
00:54:06,420 --> 00:54:06,820
you know...

759
00:54:06,860 --> 00:54:08,030
whether I’m like my father or not..

760
00:54:08,030 --> 00:54:10,030
 I couldn’t tell you because 
she got rid of him when I was little...

761
00:54:10,690 --> 00:54:11,990
And you don’t think that you need..

762
00:54:12,050 --> 00:54:13,280
to talk to anybody?

763
00:54:14,030 --> 00:54:14,570
No...

764
00:54:15,510 --> 00:54:16,700
I need a lot of things...

765
00:54:18,450 --> 00:54:19,880
I gotta wipe myself out first...

766
00:54:20,510 --> 00:54:23,170
I need to have no past, 
if I get to nothing I could start over.

767
00:54:31,330 --> 00:54:32,060
Oh..

768
00:54:33,020 --> 00:54:34,060
echo...

769
00:54:35,590 --> 00:54:36,940
you wanna help me start over?

770
00:55:12,740 --> 00:55:14,570
There is something wrong with everybody here...

771
00:55:14,570 --> 00:55:15,770
they should be in the hospital.

772
00:55:15,770 --> 00:55:16,890
Yeah, that’s right..but they’re not..

773
00:55:16,890 --> 00:55:18,730
All right? the Man wants you to be in the hospital..

774
00:55:18,730 --> 00:55:20,180
these people are fucking Americans...

775
00:55:20,180 --> 00:55:21,840
making a major stand for freedom.

776
00:55:21,840 --> 00:55:24,150
Well..assisted autonomy, but...

777
00:55:24,150 --> 00:55:25,530
this is the inside of my soul kid...

778
00:55:25,530 --> 00:55:26,570
this is what I got.

779
00:55:26,950 --> 00:55:27,460
Waw.

780
00:55:29,430 --> 00:55:31,260
Well, at least I’m gonna get rid of my mother.

781
00:55:32,540 --> 00:55:34,490
This table right here...come on.

782
00:55:40,980 --> 00:55:42,460
All right, that’s 10,000.

783
00:55:43,130 --> 00:55:44,520
How far are you going man?

784
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:46,380
As far as it goes, buddy.

785
00:55:46,890 --> 00:55:48,530
I’d go as far as that seat on the other..

786
00:55:48,540 --> 00:55:50,040
side of you man.

787
00:55:50,720 --> 00:55:52,040
Save it for the old lady, cowboy.

788
00:55:58,970 --> 00:55:59,890
That’s 500 dollars, sir.

789
00:55:59,960 --> 00:56:02,570
Yes it is. Are you a dealer or an 
investment councilor?

790
00:56:07,790 --> 00:56:08,480
Double.

791
00:56:12,020 --> 00:56:12,980
We gambling or what?

792
00:56:13,660 --> 00:56:15,680
-Just draw..give me the three. 
-You kiddin' me?

793
00:56:19,040 --> 00:56:19,520
Wow..!

794
00:56:20,760 --> 00:56:21,880
Who are you? Houdini?

795
00:56:22,240 --> 00:56:23,420
Pulled that one out of your ass!

796
00:56:29,780 --> 00:56:33,130
Pulls a three on an eight....unbelievable.

797
00:57:08,010 --> 00:57:09,300
Give me another 10,000.

798
00:57:13,320 --> 00:57:14,490
All right at 10,000.

799
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:31,080
Give me the bag.

800
00:57:46,770 --> 00:57:47,810
That’s 500 dollars, sir.

801
00:57:48,170 --> 00:57:49,240
It’s not 500 dollars...

802
00:57:49,920 --> 00:57:50,960
1000 dollars...

803
00:57:52,450 --> 00:57:53,750
another 500 dollars...

804
00:57:54,810 --> 00:57:55,560
2000 dollars...

805
00:57:55,990 --> 00:57:57,000
deal the cards please.

806
00:57:57,140 --> 00:57:58,040
2000 placed.

807
00:59:23,930 --> 00:59:24,620
Everything?

808
00:59:46,170 --> 00:59:48,470
You wanna hear something really fuckin’ crazy?

809
00:59:50,620 --> 00:59:51,640
There was this student...

810
00:59:52,840 --> 00:59:54,370
just the other day...who said my problem...

811
00:59:55,060 --> 00:59:56,380
if one’s nature is a problem...

812
00:59:56,450 --> 00:59:58,550
rather than just..fuckin’ problematic...

813
00:59:58,840 --> 01:00:01,180
right? Is I see things in terms 
of victory or death...

814
01:00:01,230 --> 01:00:03,180
and not just victory, but total victory.

815
01:00:04,090 --> 01:00:04,810
It’s true.

816
01:00:05,650 --> 01:00:06,810
I always have.

817
01:00:06,810 --> 01:00:08,810
mine is either victory or don’t bother.

818
01:00:09,130 --> 01:00:10,850
The only thing we’re doing is the impossible.

819
01:00:10,850 --> 01:00:12,850
Right? everything else is fucking gray...

820
01:00:12,900 --> 01:00:14,970
when you’re borne as 
a man with nerves of a soldier..

821
01:00:14,970 --> 01:00:17,030
the apprehension of an angel still lifts a phrase...

822
01:00:17,030 --> 01:00:19,030
but there’s no fuckin’ use for it..here?

823
01:00:19,260 --> 01:00:21,030
Where is the use for it?

824
01:00:21,030 --> 01:00:23,350
You’re set to be a philosopher, or a king..

825
01:00:23,390 --> 01:00:25,350
or fuckin’ Shakespeare...
and this is all they give you? This?!

826
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:28,780
Twenty-odd years of School, 
with all the instruction on how to be ordinary...

827
01:00:28,810 --> 01:00:30,780
or they fuckin’ kill you, and they’ll fuckin’ will...

828
01:00:31,060 --> 01:00:32,570
and then it’s a career...

829
01:00:32,570 --> 01:00:35,010
which is not the same thing as existence, so..

830
01:00:36,160 --> 01:00:37,680
I want unlimited things, I want everything..

831
01:00:37,680 --> 01:00:40,000
I want a real fuckin’ love...a real fuckin’ house...

832
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:42,100
a real fuckin’ thing to do, everyday...

833
01:00:42,100 --> 01:00:42,920
and I just...

834
01:00:45,330 --> 01:00:46,920
I’d just rather die if I don’t get it.

835
01:00:52,640 --> 01:00:54,220
Did I just say that out loud?

836
01:01:35,860 --> 01:01:38,660
Hey Jim..you stopped answering your phone.

837
01:01:40,410 --> 01:01:41,860
I told you the time frame.

838
01:01:42,330 --> 01:01:43,940
The fuck do I care about your time frame.

839
01:01:47,700 --> 01:01:48,810
So you don’t die.

840
01:01:49,180 --> 01:01:50,810
Everybody dies.

841
01:01:54,030 --> 01:01:56,400
Aren’t you afraid of dying for 
something other than natural causes?

842
01:01:57,030 --> 01:01:59,410
I gotta take whatever is coming, 
because I don’t have the money.

843
01:01:59,450 --> 01:02:01,870
Your grand father pops 
and you don’t have any money?

844
01:02:01,870 --> 01:02:04,130
My grand father 
thought I was a character builder..so.

845
01:02:04,840 --> 01:02:06,130
Not even I’ll have it?

846
01:02:06,670 --> 01:02:07,710
You just say no?

847
01:02:08,960 --> 01:02:10,500
You give the Korean any of his?

848
01:02:11,370 --> 01:02:11,810
No.

849
01:02:25,140 --> 01:02:26,280
You know Lamar Allen?

850
01:02:28,650 --> 01:02:29,290
No.

851
01:02:30,070 --> 01:02:31,640
Don’t fuck with me.

852
01:02:35,170 --> 01:02:36,260
He’s a student of mine.

853
01:02:38,280 --> 01:02:39,620
What’s this got to do with anything?

854
01:02:39,730 --> 01:02:42,080
You know, what this got to do with everything.

855
01:02:42,300 --> 01:02:43,520
How much you know Lamar?

856
01:03:12,280 --> 01:03:13,500
Hey Jim..pick up.

857
01:03:15,080 --> 01:03:15,660
Jim!

858
01:03:17,840 --> 01:03:20,500
I called that number for Lamar, 
and it wasn’t the number..

859
01:03:21,410 --> 01:03:22,940
Now Jim, I need Lamar..

860
01:03:24,200 --> 01:03:25,420
and I know where you live...

861
01:03:26,200 --> 01:03:27,690
tick tock mother fucker.

862
01:04:22,410 --> 01:04:25,000
Human weakness 
is not something I discourage...

863
01:04:25,990 --> 01:04:26,970
How could I?

864
01:04:28,120 --> 01:04:30,120
I run gambling establishments...

865
01:04:30,850 --> 01:04:32,120
I loan money...

866
01:04:37,970 --> 01:04:39,960
I’ve not been in debt for many years, but..

867
01:04:40,780 --> 01:04:42,390
I still remember the feeling...

868
01:04:43,580 --> 01:04:44,230
What’s that?

869
01:04:44,600 --> 01:04:45,840
To be obligated...

870
01:04:47,260 --> 01:04:49,140
unbalanced in one’s thoughts..

871
01:04:50,620 --> 01:04:52,580
insecure, unclean..

872
01:04:54,040 --> 01:04:55,710
I think you wanna hurt yourself..

873
01:04:56,650 --> 01:04:58,150
but make others do it for you...

874
01:04:59,500 --> 01:05:01,150
I’m not gonna tell you 
I’ll get the money all right?

875
01:05:01,150 --> 01:05:03,590
Because I don’t know 
if I can and I wouldn’t insult you.

876
01:05:05,810 --> 01:05:07,270
it Doesn’t make any difference...

877
01:05:07,460 --> 01:05:09,620
I mean I have no position....right?

878
01:05:11,130 --> 01:05:13,170
You expected your money and I don’t have it..

879
01:05:13,520 --> 01:05:15,320
Here we are..what the fuck do you wanna do?

880
01:05:15,890 --> 01:05:17,140
How am I to collect?

881
01:05:18,330 --> 01:05:19,890
Loan me another hundred thousand.

882
01:05:21,830 --> 01:05:23,940
That’s how I got in, it’s the only way I’ll get out.

883
01:06:24,260 --> 01:06:25,170
Not so bad..

884
01:06:27,550 --> 01:06:28,370
not so bad..

885
01:06:29,230 --> 01:06:32,010
perfectly good watch..
why do you want sell it?

886
01:06:32,510 --> 01:06:34,650
Well either I don’t 
need to know what time it is..

887
01:06:34,650 --> 01:06:36,260
or I need money..what do you care?

888
01:06:36,260 --> 01:06:37,680
Well, I need to know if it is...

889
01:06:37,680 --> 01:06:39,770
No, what you need to do 
is just come up with an offer or not.

890
01:06:45,160 --> 01:06:45,810
We have so many..

891
01:06:45,810 --> 01:06:46,590
of these here.

892
01:06:46,780 --> 01:06:47,620
It’s an Omega..!

893
01:06:48,250 --> 01:06:50,010
It’s worth more than six thousand brand new..

894
01:06:50,010 --> 01:06:51,010
and when you have it...

895
01:06:51,010 --> 01:06:52,720
no one will know that it isn’t brand new.

896
01:06:52,780 --> 01:06:54,130
Your are insulting me why?

897
01:06:54,170 --> 01:06:55,270
I’m insulting you?

898
01:06:55,380 --> 01:06:56,570
Why, why are you insulting me?

899
01:06:56,570 --> 01:06:57,620
You know, we’re not gonna fuck around..

900
01:06:57,620 --> 01:06:59,490
No,no, don’t even talk to me anymore..

901
01:06:59,490 --> 01:07:01,960
I want you to understand 
that when I say what I want for it...

902
01:07:02,020 --> 01:07:04,690
I’m giving you the figure 
that I would take for it, you understand me?

903
01:07:04,810 --> 01:07:05,730
No, no, no look at me...

904
01:07:05,790 --> 01:07:07,130
I will say the price now..

905
01:07:07,130 --> 01:07:09,340
and you will either say yes or no..
do you understand?

906
01:07:10,120 --> 01:07:11,240
It is impossible...

907
01:07:11,370 --> 01:07:12,660
impossible to say yes or..

908
01:07:12,660 --> 01:07:13,340
All right.

909
01:07:13,700 --> 01:07:15,320
Wait..wait wait..

910
01:07:15,580 --> 01:07:18,120
It is a good watch..
I am good man you are good man..

911
01:07:18,120 --> 01:07:21,000
No, I told you not to say anything but 
yes or no you’re wasting my time

912
01:07:21,040 --> 01:07:23,790
I’m willing to listening to your price..ok?

913
01:07:24,240 --> 01:07:25,250
You can’t counter it...

914
01:07:25,440 --> 01:07:27,510
when I say my figure...that’s the figure..

915
01:07:27,510 --> 01:07:29,640
and you either say yes or no, you got it?

916
01:07:31,020 --> 01:07:33,210
How can I say yes or no if I am not hearing..

917
01:07:33,310 --> 01:07:34,060
the price?

918
01:07:34,750 --> 01:07:35,920
You’r not getting it...

919
01:07:36,080 --> 01:07:37,600
-I’m getting it. 
-You're not getting it.

920
01:07:37,620 --> 01:07:38,200
No, no, no..

921
01:07:38,440 --> 01:07:40,250
-I am getting it. 
-You're not getting it.

922
01:07:40,270 --> 01:07:42,380
You need to understand fully that what I say...

923
01:07:42,400 --> 01:07:43,380
it’s  not an opening figure..

924
01:07:43,380 --> 01:07:44,680
You can say yes or no..

925
01:07:44,730 --> 01:07:48,150
you can not say a lower figure and 
expect to meet me at some point in the middle..

926
01:07:48,150 --> 01:07:49,750
do you under fuckin stand

927
01:07:50,170 --> 01:07:51,010
Please....please..

928
01:07:51,050 --> 01:07:53,690
we are mour..yes? amour..ok?

929
01:07:54,060 --> 01:07:55,070
Calm..calm..

930
01:07:55,420 --> 01:07:58,080
Yes...I understand..what is your price?

931
01:07:58,570 --> 01:08:00,790
Three thousand...five hundred dollars.

932
01:08:04,630 --> 01:08:05,540
One thousand..

933
01:08:06,070 --> 01:08:06,680
twelve hundred

934
01:08:06,700 --> 01:08:08,340
Go fuck yourself I don’t give a shit.

935
01:08:08,380 --> 01:08:09,520
Wow..no need for this..what?

936
01:08:09,520 --> 01:08:10,880
where are you going?

937
01:08:11,180 --> 01:08:12,530
What are you doing?

938
01:08:12,530 --> 01:08:14,240
Wait one second..please...please

939
01:08:14,240 --> 01:08:17,420
-I can’t help myself. 
-Yes you can...try.

940
01:08:17,990 --> 01:08:19,100
Two thousand..?

941
01:08:21,020 --> 01:08:22,380
Why..it’s good price.

942
01:08:22,630 --> 01:08:25,030
I give you check...it’s no problem.

943
01:09:06,630 --> 01:09:07,330
Jim..!

944
01:09:09,110 --> 01:09:11,580
Man you gave me the wrong number on Lamar..

945
01:09:12,580 --> 01:09:13,830
you know what else I know?

946
01:09:14,580 --> 01:09:15,290
What’s that?

947
01:09:16,220 --> 01:09:18,440
You think all Koreans are Koreans and shit...

948
01:09:18,560 --> 01:09:21,010
they don’t communicate with the 
American Negro..

949
01:09:24,060 --> 01:09:26,770
I heard you asked Mr. Lee 
to stick you out of your situation..

950
01:09:26,960 --> 01:09:28,920
and to give you enough to 
have a shot at the title..

951
01:09:28,920 --> 01:09:31,280
of being the world’s stupidest ass hole.

952
01:09:32,750 --> 01:09:33,920
Give me Mr. Lee’s money.

953
01:09:34,510 --> 01:09:35,920
He didn’t front me any.

954
01:09:36,150 --> 01:09:36,870
Fuck you.

955
01:09:36,940 --> 01:09:38,540
Well, your information is wrong.

956
01:09:38,860 --> 01:09:40,820
How am I gonna get my money Jim?

957
01:09:41,120 --> 01:09:43,380
What if I told you I quit my job, and I’m 
gonna write a novel?

958
01:09:43,900 --> 01:09:44,800
Really?

959
01:09:45,660 --> 01:09:46,960
What did the first one make?

960
01:09:47,080 --> 01:09:49,870
With the advance and royalties..
17,000 dollars all in.

961
01:09:50,550 --> 01:09:51,200
Fuck me..

962
01:09:51,910 --> 01:09:54,650
For one of the 
better reviewed first novels of 2007?

963
01:09:54,650 --> 01:09:55,980
I think I’ll make other arrangements..

964
01:09:56,160 --> 01:09:57,620
I mean, the culture apparently did..

965
01:09:58,180 --> 01:10:00,520
so let’s talk cash first, other business later.

966
01:10:00,770 --> 01:10:01,800
What about your family?

967
01:10:02,730 --> 01:10:03,800
Got all I could get.

968
01:10:03,800 --> 01:10:05,070
Can I get the money from them?

969
01:10:05,440 --> 01:10:07,380
If I send you to Mexico? You know..

970
01:10:07,430 --> 01:10:09,690
Oh my god I don’t know what happened to him..

971
01:10:09,760 --> 01:10:11,680
get my friend Valerio to mail them your dick.

972
01:10:12,190 --> 01:10:14,480
My family didn’t make their money 
because they pay up easily.

973
01:10:15,670 --> 01:10:17,270
Apparently that’s genetic..

974
01:10:20,170 --> 01:10:23,890
I tell you boy, genetics..
cruel mother fuckin’ mistress.

975
01:10:25,030 --> 01:10:27,490
What if I lit a cigar and put it out 
in your eyeball..

976
01:10:27,520 --> 01:10:28,530
would you give me the money then?

977
01:10:28,850 --> 01:10:30,530
Do I look like a magician?

978
01:10:30,530 --> 01:10:31,450
You must’ve thought you..

979
01:10:31,450 --> 01:10:32,850
was magic occasionally...

980
01:10:32,850 --> 01:10:34,850
or else you wouldn’t be in the 
Africa membership club..

981
01:10:34,850 --> 01:10:36,190
owing me sixty grand.

982
01:10:39,260 --> 01:10:41,120
I’m gonna need the equity on your house Jim..

983
01:10:41,870 --> 01:10:43,270
We paper it right as a sale...

984
01:10:44,140 --> 01:10:46,440
but then I gotta take over the 
goddamn mortgage...

985
01:10:47,060 --> 01:10:49,500
find some fucking vice-president 
of animation to rent it to..

986
01:10:49,500 --> 01:10:51,900
and I don’t fuckin’ wanna do that shit.

987
01:10:53,140 --> 01:10:55,840
But you gotta make the turnip bleed from 
what ever hole it’s got, right?

988
01:10:56,670 --> 01:10:59,050
Now your grand father..I respect him..

989
01:10:59,050 --> 01:11:00,850
he’s a business man..

990
01:11:00,970 --> 01:11:02,820
but Lamar who you gave me the 
wrong number for...

991
01:11:02,820 --> 01:11:05,260
Lamar is a good kid all right? 
He doesn’t need any of this shit.

992
01:11:05,440 --> 01:11:07,290
You’re gonna tell me you made 
a mistake with the number?

993
01:11:07,500 --> 01:11:10,410
Why would I tell you I made a mistake? 
I gave you a fake one, I made it up.

994
01:11:11,200 --> 01:11:11,690
Ok..

995
01:11:12,060 --> 01:11:15,250
Well see, my man Mr. Jones here is gonna 
give you the real one.

996
01:11:29,300 --> 01:11:31,920
That is the last time that you lie to me my friend..

997
01:11:32,730 --> 01:11:34,140
Lamar don’t need your help..

998
01:11:34,410 --> 01:11:36,220
every man’s gotta go it alone Jim..

999
01:11:36,220 --> 01:11:40,240
and Lamar is gotta make his own 
choices, so let him make it.

1000
01:11:41,970 --> 01:11:43,540
Now I’m not gonna call him..

1001
01:11:44,680 --> 01:11:47,040
that would really confuse the issue.

1002
01:11:51,670 --> 01:11:53,420
But you’re gonna get me Lamar...

1003
01:11:53,850 --> 01:11:56,180
and it will be more than an introduction...

1004
01:11:57,370 --> 01:11:59,480
In fact, I don’t even want an introduction...

1005
01:11:59,890 --> 01:12:02,430
Lamar is gonna do exactly what 
I want him to do..

1006
01:12:02,430 --> 01:12:04,430
without ever seeing my face..

1007
01:12:04,660 --> 01:12:07,290
I need him before the game tomorrow at home..

1008
01:12:07,780 --> 01:12:09,890
now they’re running 8 point on Michigan...

1009
01:12:09,890 --> 01:12:10,780
you can tell Lamar he

1010
01:12:10,800 --> 01:12:13,400
can win if he wants, but no more than seven.

1011
01:12:13,520 --> 01:12:15,400
but you get him for tomorrow...

1012
01:12:15,600 --> 01:12:16,720
cause if not...

1013
01:12:16,820 --> 01:12:19,420
I’m gonna kill that pretty little blond girl...

1014
01:12:20,810 --> 01:12:23,130
show you the pictures and then kill you next.

1015
01:12:31,670 --> 01:12:33,160
Hey, what’s happening man?

1016
01:12:34,060 --> 01:12:35,730
Oh man, makin’it do with the do..

1017
01:12:35,730 --> 01:12:38,930
Yes sir..haha..no doubt.

1018
01:13:03,620 --> 01:13:05,210
What happened to your face?

1019
01:13:07,580 --> 01:13:09,950
Whatever happened had already happened 
it won’t happen again.

1020
01:13:11,870 --> 01:13:13,920
So you’re starting to make promises now?

1021
01:13:13,960 --> 01:13:15,550
That’s not happening.

1022
01:13:24,500 --> 01:13:25,340
You don’t get it.

1023
01:13:27,670 --> 01:13:28,830
What’s going on?

1024
01:13:29,480 --> 01:13:31,030
I’m getting out of here as fast as I can..

1025
01:13:31,030 --> 01:13:33,200
and as everybody and their fuckin’ Aunt 
is eyeballing me right now..

1026
01:13:33,270 --> 01:13:35,680
it might be better if you’re not chasing 
along as if you were my wife.

1027
01:13:35,740 --> 01:13:36,990
Jesus Christ!

1028
01:13:37,070 --> 01:13:38,790
Gotta tell you the truth all right? 
That’s all I got.

1029
01:13:38,790 --> 01:13:39,170
No..

1030
01:13:39,660 --> 01:13:40,460
No...

1031
01:13:41,860 --> 01:13:43,480
You can’t talk to people like that.

1032
01:13:43,530 --> 01:13:45,800
Really? Who says? Huh?

1033
01:13:45,910 --> 01:13:46,830
Who says?

1034
01:13:47,930 --> 01:13:48,890
I do.

1035
01:13:50,280 --> 01:13:52,040
I want you to stop looking concerned ok?

1036
01:13:52,270 --> 01:13:53,820
I want you to shake my hand..

1037
01:13:54,080 --> 01:13:55,820
you the kind of fuckin’ man I am..

1038
01:13:55,930 --> 01:13:57,420
don’t lie to yourself...I don’t

1039
01:13:58,310 --> 01:13:59,420
What happened?

1040
01:13:59,730 --> 01:14:00,970
Nothing happened...

1041
01:14:02,400 --> 01:14:03,770
you’re not getting it ok?

1042
01:14:03,870 --> 01:14:04,530
just..

1043
01:14:05,130 --> 01:14:06,450
if I come to your door, then I’ll have made it..

1044
01:14:06,450 --> 01:14:08,940
everything will start to be all right 
if I don’t come then I didn’t fuckin’ make it...

1045
01:14:08,940 --> 01:14:11,700
and what you do with the dead 
is you bury them, that’s it.

1046
01:14:13,200 --> 01:14:15,470
You really hate yourself that much?

1047
01:14:16,910 --> 01:14:18,700
Hold out your hand and say good bye.

1048
01:14:20,510 --> 01:14:21,200
Please.

1049
01:14:26,900 --> 01:14:27,930
Please.

1050
01:14:29,460 --> 01:14:32,110
It’s really fuckin’ easy to be passionate 
about...

1051
01:14:32,300 --> 01:14:33,930
Robert fuckin’ Greene.

1052
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:39,740
What happened to your face man?

1053
01:15:40,390 --> 01:15:43,570
A little while ago you came to me for 
advice about turning pro..

1054
01:15:43,710 --> 01:15:44,940
I know it’s about your knee..

1055
01:15:45,220 --> 01:15:47,860
I know you have a feeling you have to 
put money in the bank, so..

1056
01:15:50,350 --> 01:15:53,250
I was wondering if you’d like 
to make a hundred and fifty grand in two hours.

1057
01:15:54,030 --> 01:15:55,880
Depends on what you have in mind.

1058
01:15:57,740 --> 01:15:58,850
Throwing a game...

1059
01:16:01,130 --> 01:16:03,470
you can’t win tomorrow by more than 7 points.

1060
01:16:04,270 --> 01:16:05,470
That’s not throwing the game..

1061
01:16:05,780 --> 01:16:07,390
that’s winning by less than 8...

1062
01:16:07,710 --> 01:16:09,390
who want’s me to do it?

1063
01:16:10,660 --> 01:16:11,760
What they got on you?

1064
01:16:12,310 --> 01:16:13,460
It doesn’t matter.

1065
01:16:26,530 --> 01:16:28,220
Man, they fucked you up...

1066
01:16:28,780 --> 01:16:30,480
they didn’t need to fuck you up.

1067
01:16:31,190 --> 01:16:32,520
No, I needed it...

1068
01:16:32,590 --> 01:16:35,560
and they’ll fuck you up if you need it too, 
you gotta deliver.

1069
01:16:40,170 --> 01:16:43,120
I’m asking because I know you need it, 
it’s up to you, it’s your call

1070
01:16:44,500 --> 01:16:46,440
I do this that get you out of trouble?

1071
01:16:46,700 --> 01:16:47,470
No.

1072
01:17:02,670 --> 01:17:03,420
Hey...

1073
01:17:04,640 --> 01:17:07,210
Where do a teacher like you get 
that kind of money?

1074
01:17:23,580 --> 01:17:27,790
Well, they fuckin’ weren’t supposed to, 
were they? That was the point.

1075
01:17:29,040 --> 01:17:29,950
Sit down.

1076
01:17:32,380 --> 01:17:33,280
You drink?

1077
01:17:33,420 --> 01:17:34,940
I don’t remember if you drink..

1078
01:17:34,980 --> 01:17:36,940
Of course there’s drink...and drink..

1079
01:17:37,280 --> 01:17:38,170
I drink..

1080
01:17:38,280 --> 01:17:40,910
but I haven’t been drunk since 
Reagan was President..

1081
01:17:41,370 --> 01:17:43,140
I got a DUI and in jail..

1082
01:17:43,140 --> 01:17:45,130
I actually..fell down, and pissed my..

1083
01:17:45,130 --> 01:17:45,690
pants..

1084
01:17:45,800 --> 01:17:47,430
you don’t need to do that twice..

1085
01:17:47,570 --> 01:17:50,010
I tell you this so you know everybody’s 
been there.

1086
01:17:50,280 --> 01:17:51,430
Everybody’s been there.

1087
01:17:51,550 --> 01:17:52,490
Once..

1088
01:17:52,670 --> 01:17:53,740
if you’re there twice..

1089
01:17:54,020 --> 01:17:56,150
having been there once, I can’t help you

1090
01:17:56,930 --> 01:17:57,740
you know..

1091
01:17:58,560 --> 01:18:00,110
I listen to the drunks..

1092
01:18:00,640 --> 01:18:02,950
and it’s like you’re listening to a fairy story..

1093
01:18:02,950 --> 01:18:04,640
about a fight with a fuckin’ monster..

1094
01:18:04,640 --> 01:18:06,440
when the actual title to the story is:

1095
01:18:06,450 --> 01:18:08,800
I Can't Handle My Liquor by Mr. Cry Baby.

1096
01:18:08,850 --> 01:18:09,390
Amen.

1097
01:18:09,390 --> 01:18:10,940
I don’t know maybe they gotta a problem..

1098
01:18:10,940 --> 01:18:12,940
but fuck’em if they do, cause I don’t..

1099
01:18:12,940 --> 01:18:14,320
which leads me to ask...

1100
01:18:14,580 --> 01:18:17,380
are you pulling this shit just now? or forever?

1101
01:18:18,910 --> 01:18:19,820
I mean..

1102
01:18:20,080 --> 01:18:21,520
do you have a problem..

1103
01:18:21,560 --> 01:18:24,530
wa wa wa like some little fuckin’ girl..wa wa wa

1104
01:18:24,600 --> 01:18:28,120
or some Somali who can’t process that 
there’s no food where they live?

1105
01:18:28,220 --> 01:18:32,390
or are you just fucked up temporarily cause 
you’re temporarily fuckin’ stupid?

1106
01:18:34,250 --> 01:18:35,310
Are you long business

1107
01:18:35,310 --> 01:18:36,260
or short business?

1108
01:18:36,360 --> 01:18:37,620
What’s the difference?

1109
01:18:37,710 --> 01:18:41,040
I need to know if you got the fuckin’ brains 
to walk when it’s time to walk...

1110
01:18:41,230 --> 01:18:42,430
people don’t you know?

1111
01:18:42,670 --> 01:18:44,630
Ball players who can’t play any more..

1112
01:18:44,720 --> 01:18:48,630
ass holes trying to maintain a standard of 
living not possible any more..

1113
01:18:48,830 --> 01:18:50,630
a lot of those around.

1114
01:18:51,540 --> 01:18:53,630
I’ve seen you be half a million dollars up.

1115
01:18:54,880 --> 01:18:56,740
I’ve been up two and a half million dollars.

1116
01:18:56,910 --> 01:18:58,160
What do you got on you?

1117
01:18:58,760 --> 01:18:59,590
Nothing.

1118
01:19:00,340 --> 01:19:01,670
What did you put away?

1119
01:19:01,980 --> 01:19:02,690
Nothing.

1120
01:19:04,040 --> 01:19:06,120
You get up two and a half million dollars..

1121
01:19:06,120 --> 01:19:07,460
any ass hole in the world..

1122
01:19:07,470 --> 01:19:08,450
knows what to do..

1123
01:19:08,450 --> 01:19:10,450
you get a house with a twenty five year roof..

1124
01:19:10,480 --> 01:19:11,430
an indestructible...

1125
01:19:11,430 --> 01:19:13,170
Jap economy shitbox..

1126
01:19:13,190 --> 01:19:15,270
you put the rest into the system at 3 to 5

1127
01:19:15,270 --> 01:19:17,840
percent to pay your taxes and that's 
your base, get me?

1128
01:19:17,980 --> 01:19:20,240
That’s your fortress of fuckin’ solitude..

1129
01:19:20,240 --> 01:19:22,240
that puts you, for the rest of your life,

1130
01:19:22,260 --> 01:19:24,420
at a level...of fuck you.

1131
01:19:24,590 --> 01:19:26,720
Somebody wants you to do something? Fuck you.

1132
01:19:26,760 --> 01:19:29,180
Boss pisses you off..fuck you.

1133
01:19:29,380 --> 01:19:30,620
Own your house..

1134
01:19:30,650 --> 01:19:32,710
have a couple of bucks in the bank..

1135
01:19:32,800 --> 01:19:33,720
don’t drink.

1136
01:19:33,960 --> 01:19:36,860
That’s all I have to say to anybody 
at any social level..

1137
01:19:36,910 --> 01:19:38,860
did your grand father take risks?

1138
01:19:39,690 --> 01:19:40,470
Yes.

01:19:44,210 --> 01:19:45,540
A wise man’s life...

1142
01:19:45,740 --> 01:19:47,360
is based around fuck you..

1143
01:19:47,360 --> 01:19:50,220
the Unites States of America is based 
on fuck you..

1144
01:19:50,270 --> 01:19:52,950
You’re a king..you have an Army...

1145
01:19:53,000 --> 01:19:55,080
greatest Navy in the history of the world?

1146
01:19:55,080 --> 01:19:57,080
Fuck you, blow me.

1147
01:19:57,380 --> 01:19:59,080

we have done. Beautiful fuck you position 
lost forever..

1150
01:20:04,100 --> 01:20:07,210
King George the third looks like a fuckin’ 
birthday present.

1151
01:20:07,380 --> 01:20:10,190
This is the grand son of the..

1152
01:20:10,190 --> 01:20:12,450
seventeenth richest man in California...

1153
01:20:12,610 --> 01:20:13,450
Does he drink?

1154
01:20:13,750 --> 01:20:15,390
What he wants...is money..

1155
01:20:15,390 --> 01:20:17,200
cause he doesn’t know when to say that's it..

1156
01:20:17,230 --> 01:20:19,580
I’m two million ahead, fuck it, fuck you...

1157
01:20:19,580 --> 01:20:22,000
I have a car and a house and a family...

1158
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:24,390
and it’s all payed for...fuck you.

1159
01:20:24,780 --> 01:20:28,390
I mean even I did that..of course it was 
out by Pearblossom.

1160
01:20:28,700 --> 01:20:31,260
I’ll have a beer just like anybody else, 
thank you.

1161
01:20:31,380 --> 01:20:32,130
What kind?

1162
01:20:32,410 --> 01:20:33,230
Any kind.

1163
01:20:33,310 --> 01:20:35,590
I got 37 beers, don’t fuckin’ put it on me.

1164
01:20:35,980 --> 01:20:38,270
But he did put it on you miss.

1165
01:20:41,690 --> 01:20:44,390
You still owe large two places you shouldn’t..

1166
01:20:45,460 --> 01:20:47,230
why do you want door number three?

1167
01:20:47,870 --> 01:20:49,060
How else do I get out?

1168
01:20:49,200 --> 01:20:51,380
Time payments, sell your sperm, sell your ass,

1169
01:20:51,390 --> 01:20:52,920
how the fuck should I know?

1170
01:20:53,920 --> 01:20:57,050
I am of the universe, 
and you know what it’s worth.

1171
01:20:57,230 --> 01:20:58,340
It’s worth plenty.

1172
01:21:01,840 --> 01:21:03,590
If I give you this money...

1173
01:21:04,990 --> 01:21:06,830
and you don’t pay me back..

1174
01:21:07,280 --> 01:21:08,760
there are no rules..

1175
01:21:09,070 --> 01:21:12,370
you never get to say fuck you to anybody ever.

1176
01:21:13,400 --> 01:21:16,690
You will get me not just what 
you owe me from your family...

1177
01:21:16,720 --> 01:21:18,240
you will get me their accounts..

1178
01:21:18,240 --> 01:21:20,370
so I can have them vacuumed from Russia..

1179
01:21:20,370 --> 01:21:21,590

1180
01:21:21,590 --> 01:21:24,810
you can doing it knowing I 
will kill your entire blood line..

1181
01:21:25,770 --> 01:21:28,420
Do you understand the 
gravity of your situation?

1182
01:21:30,430 --> 01:21:31,440
I understand.

1183
01:21:34,120 --> 01:21:35,760
You get up..you get out..

1184
01:21:38,150 --> 01:21:39,700
260 as requested.

1185
01:21:41,290 --> 01:21:42,530
What’s this?

1186
01:21:42,970 --> 01:21:44,980
With this much money..what’s a car?

1187
01:21:48,060 --> 01:21:49,940
What do you wanna be able to say to me?

1188
01:21:52,830 --> 01:21:53,830
Fuck you.

1189
01:22:51,070 --> 01:22:52,390
You have my money?

1190
01:22:52,970 --> 01:22:54,390
I don’t have any money.

1191
01:22:56,720 --> 01:22:58,190
I want you to stake me.

1192
01:23:13,350 --> 01:23:14,650
Stake me and I’ll get your money.

1193
01:23:20,830 --> 01:23:22,320
Why did you see Frank?

1194
01:23:22,460 --> 01:23:23,260
I didn’t..

1195
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:25,260
fucking stake me.

1196
01:23:28,730 --> 01:23:31,970
Please..tell me you hit your wife 
harder than that you fuckin’ pussy.

1197
01:23:35,520 --> 01:23:37,200
You’re gonna give a hundred and fifty..

1198
01:23:37,200 --> 01:23:38,720
fuckin’ thousand

1199
01:23:46,880 --> 01:23:48,410
What can I do with you?

1200
01:23:54,710 --> 01:23:55,930
Stake me.

1201
01:24:08,960 --> 01:24:10,270
Fuckin’ stake me.

1202
01:25:48,960 --> 01:25:50,540
That’s my boy there Lamar.

1203
01:25:50,660 --> 01:25:51,430
That’s your boy?

1204
01:25:52,890 --> 01:25:54,830
That’s the kid I’m talking about right there..

1205
01:25:54,960 --> 01:25:56,830
he know what he gotta do..

1206
01:26:17,490 --> 01:26:19,340
All right, all right now, all right..

1207
01:26:47,680 --> 01:26:49,570
Hang on, hang on, this shit ain’t right..

1208
01:26:54,900 --> 01:26:56,040
What is he doing?

1209
01:27:03,010 --> 01:27:05,370
Man he better stop performing and less scoring.

1210
01:27:05,370 --> 01:27:07,370
I don’t get it? Ain’t that your man?

1211
01:27:07,430 --> 01:27:08,950
Yeah if he don’t handle his business,

1212
01:27:08,960 --> 01:27:10,950
I’m gonna handle him.

1213
01:27:22,380 --> 01:27:24,470
Yeah that's better..that's better.

1214
01:27:45,170 --> 01:27:48,400
That’s more like, that’s what I’m taking about.

1215
01:28:11,900 --> 01:28:14,460
That’s all right, get in Lamar.

1216
01:28:37,720 --> 01:28:39,480
Still in that bench Lamar.

1217
01:28:55,530 --> 01:28:58,880
And a foul..take it to the house mother fucker.

1218
01:29:01,400 --> 01:29:03,930
Yeah, Ok, we good, we good.

1219
01:29:04,300 --> 01:29:05,180
There you go.

1220
01:29:26,150 --> 01:29:27,380
Stay on the bench Lamar...

1221
01:29:27,420 --> 01:29:30,290
stay on that fuckin’ bench Lamar 
stay on the fuckin’ bench.

1222
01:29:52,600 --> 01:29:53,840
Oh, come on..

1223
01:29:54,120 --> 01:29:56,270
what did this mother fucker just do?

1224
01:30:04,570 --> 01:30:06,140
Damn!

1225
01:30:29,570 --> 01:30:30,730
Oh, come on!

1226
01:30:32,330 --> 01:30:35,210
He’s fuckin’ up like that he 
knows what he’s got to be doing..

1227
01:30:35,210 --> 01:30:36,720
Yeah, say that to your man, he’s scoring.

1228
01:30:36,720 --> 01:30:38,230
Yeah, too damn much.

1229
01:30:43,400 --> 01:30:45,280
Oh come on man, that’s some bullshit!

1230
01:30:45,280 --> 01:30:47,050
I told him less than eight.

1231
01:31:49,820 --> 01:31:50,880
Yes sir...

1232
01:31:52,590 --> 01:31:53,900
Yes sir..

1233
01:31:55,370 --> 01:31:56,840
our boy delivered...

1234
01:31:57,260 --> 01:31:58,410
you delivered...

1235
01:31:59,230 --> 01:32:00,700
you know how rare that is?

1236
01:32:00,700 --> 01:32:01,920
A man delivers?

1237
01:32:02,590 --> 01:32:03,920
So we’re square?

1238
01:32:04,310 --> 01:32:06,460
You’re gonna stop threatening the girl?

1239
01:32:06,560 --> 01:32:07,720
How about I tell you..

1240
01:32:07,720 --> 01:32:09,950
you get to keep your job with the University...

1241
01:32:10,110 --> 01:32:10,890
forever..

1242
01:32:11,040 --> 01:32:13,980
just as long as you keep teaching English 101

1243
01:32:14,060 --> 01:32:15,790
to a whole lot of tall brothers.

1244
01:32:16,170 --> 01:32:17,950
Or I tell you to kill me.

1245
01:32:22,880 --> 01:32:23,880
Have a drink...

1246
01:32:24,810 --> 01:32:25,880
Don’t want one.

1247
01:32:28,970 --> 01:32:30,020
Thank you sweetheart.

1248
01:32:30,650 --> 01:32:32,880
I see the Koreans fucked your face up!

1249
01:32:33,150 --> 01:32:34,250
Yes they did.

1250
01:32:34,540 --> 01:32:37,140
And you just move on 
to the next phase of bullshit..

1251
01:32:39,560 --> 01:32:40,490
You know?

1252
01:32:40,840 --> 01:32:42,840
The only trouble is with the game today?

1253
01:32:43,330 --> 01:32:44,560
What’s that?

1254
01:32:44,910 --> 01:32:47,700
Someone also bet an 
eight-point spread in Vegas..

1255
01:32:47,700 --> 01:32:49,990
for a whole lot of fuckin’ money..

1256
01:32:53,610 --> 01:32:55,850
you wouldn’t happen to 
know who did that would you?

1257
01:32:57,160 --> 01:32:58,230
No idea.

1258
01:32:59,520 --> 01:33:01,080
You ain’t tipped nobody?

1259
01:33:03,340 --> 01:33:04,080
No.

1260
01:33:08,540 --> 01:33:10,380
What’s your life’s plan Jim?

1261
01:33:14,630 --> 01:33:17,050
Make part of it never seeing me again.

1262
01:33:18,300 --> 01:33:19,920
I don’t need you no more brother.

1263
01:33:20,180 --> 01:33:21,100
I know that.

1264
01:33:21,240 --> 01:33:22,650
Think I want you out there..

1265
01:33:22,670 --> 01:33:25,280
 knowing that? Knowing this?

1266
01:33:25,970 --> 01:33:28,010
I’m going to tell that I’m not going to..

1267
01:33:28,010 --> 01:33:31,210
do you the discourtesy of 
assuming what your thinking..

1268
01:33:31,700 --> 01:33:33,570
but I know you’ll do the right thing.

1269
01:33:37,230 --> 01:33:38,510
Why is that?

1270
01:33:41,440 --> 01:33:45,090
It’s the whole amount..and points.

1271
01:34:01,000 --> 01:34:02,380
Where did you get that?

1272
01:34:03,330 --> 01:34:06,260
-I borrowed it from Frank. 
-The fuck you did

1273
01:34:06,390 --> 01:34:08,060
-Ask him.
-I will.

1274
01:34:08,110 --> 01:34:10,060
And you will find out that I did.

1275
01:34:17,820 --> 01:34:20,540
You know Jim, everybody is ready to be bent..

1276
01:34:22,060 --> 01:34:23,610
Some ready to be straight..

1277
01:34:25,240 --> 01:34:26,740
personally I’m ready to be..

1278
01:34:26,780 --> 01:34:28,600
straight...

1279
01:34:33,310 --> 01:34:36,080
I’m gonna get my self a avocado farm...

1280
01:34:38,540 --> 01:34:39,740
or a winery..

1281
01:34:42,050 --> 01:34:43,970
do what I gotta do, you know?

1282
01:34:44,030 --> 01:34:46,410
Not a huge fan of low company.

1283
01:35:05,760 --> 01:35:08,250
A man can transform his shit Jim.

1284
01:35:35,900 --> 01:35:39,030
You know, I’ve never 
done anything like this before..

1285
01:35:39,050 --> 01:35:41,660
I mean I didn’t think I was gonna 
make it out there alive..you know.

1286
01:35:44,760 --> 01:35:45,770
Open it...

1287
01:35:47,160 --> 01:35:49,120
take out fifty grand, it’s yours.

1288
01:35:58,400 --> 01:36:00,400
Man, I’m gonna have my fuckin’..

1289
01:36:00,410 --> 01:36:02,860
picture on a Wheaties box 
within months dude.

1290
01:36:03,770 --> 01:36:05,420
Well, suite yourself.

1291
01:36:08,000 --> 01:36:10,440
What was the point of me going to Vegas?

1292
01:36:11,070 --> 01:36:13,490
Obviously it wasn’t to earn fifty grand.

1293
01:36:13,690 --> 01:36:15,490
time to get away from me Dexter...

1294
01:36:15,630 --> 01:36:16,960
Far away.

1295
01:36:28,110 --> 01:36:29,120
I got your money..

1296
01:36:29,150 --> 01:36:31,160
but I’m not coming there, you gotta meet me..

1297
01:36:31,350 --> 01:36:33,160
Korea town, you the place right?

1298
01:36:33,160 --> 01:36:34,600
Everybody knows the place...

1299
01:36:34,600 --> 01:36:36,440
whether or not I want you around that place..

1300
01:36:36,440 --> 01:36:39,360
with my money in your 
hand is another fuckin’ story.

1301
01:36:39,360 --> 01:36:41,310
Well that’s the only place I’ll meet you.

1302
01:36:42,720 --> 01:36:45,230
You have all my money plus everything.

1303
01:36:45,790 --> 01:36:47,560
Yeah, I have all your money..

1304
01:36:47,560 --> 01:36:48,910
but I don’t have everything...

1305
01:36:48,990 --> 01:36:50,360
you gotta meet me there.

1306
01:36:50,360 --> 01:36:52,860
What do you do when 
you’re in the fuck you position?

1307
01:36:53,000 --> 01:36:55,500
Well we’v had that discussion and 
I understand your point...

1308
01:36:55,500 --> 01:36:56,450
but you gotta meet me there.

1309
01:36:56,940 --> 01:36:59,540
If there’s a list of places were nobody gets ripped off..

1310
01:36:59,550 --> 01:37:01,540
I believe that’s at the top.

1311
01:40:11,130 --> 01:40:12,180
You have my money?

1312
01:40:12,830 --> 01:40:13,650
Yes.

1313
01:40:13,960 --> 01:40:15,520
Then you must come outside.

1314
01:40:16,120 --> 01:40:16,830
No...

1315
01:40:20,710 --> 01:40:21,880
I owe him too.

1316
01:40:25,190 --> 01:40:26,430
You’re gonna play?

1317
01:40:26,680 --> 01:40:28,190
It’s the only way I can pay you both...

1318
01:40:28,190 --> 01:40:29,240
you can’t take the money off..

1319
01:40:29,240 --> 01:40:30,700
me here and neither can he.

1320
01:40:31,170 --> 01:40:33,400
Red or Black, all or nothing, all 
the money down that’s all I’ll do..

1321
01:40:33,870 --> 01:40:34,890
move.

1322
01:40:42,180 --> 01:40:42,880
Take a very..

1323
01:40:42,890 --> 01:40:44,150
sizable bet?

1324
01:40:44,440 --> 01:40:46,280
That is what this room is for.

1325
01:40:49,380 --> 01:40:50,980
What the fuck are you doing?

1326
01:40:51,440 --> 01:40:53,290
What the fuck are you doing?

1327
01:41:30,760 --> 01:41:32,080
All on black.

1328
01:42:37,840 --> 01:42:40,640
I was playing for Mr. Lee 
and for that gentleman over there.

1329
01:42:44,460 --> 01:42:46,250
I’m not actually a gambler.

1330
01:43:15,480 --> 01:43:16,720
Key is in the car.

1331
01:43:16,950 --> 01:43:18,250
You don’t need a ride?

1332
01:43:18,570 --> 01:43:20,250
No I’ll walk, I feel like walking.

1333
01:43:20,490 --> 01:43:21,810
What do you got on you?

1334
01:43:22,130 --> 01:43:23,690
Not a fuckin’ cent.

1335
01:43:23,760 --> 01:43:25,690
That’s not a fuck you position.

1336
01:43:25,690 --> 01:43:26,850
Yes it is.

1337
01:43:27,060 --> 01:43:28,530
Here's your hundred...

1338
01:43:28,730 --> 01:43:31,090
turns out to us a little extra, cream on top..

1339
01:43:31,110 --> 01:43:32,100
on me.

1340
01:43:32,630 --> 01:43:33,610
Fuck you.

1341
01:43:38,330 --> 01:43:39,340
Good boy.
