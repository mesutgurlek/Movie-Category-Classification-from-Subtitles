1
00:01:45,397 --> 00:01:47,858
Scared the living crap out of me.

2
00:01:47,858 --> 00:01:49,860
Meryl Streep she wasn't.

3
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:51,695
Who's Meryl Streep?

4
00:01:51,695 --> 00:01:54,823
Zoe, she's like Katie Holmes
to our parents.

5
00:01:54,823 --> 00:01:57,534
So, what's next, ladies?

6
00:01:57,534 --> 00:01:59,411
-I have to go home.
-No.

7
00:01:59,411 --> 00:02:03,415
I can't have another fight with
my parents. They think I'm in bed.

8
00:02:04,833 --> 00:02:06,710
Were you kids in bed early?

9
00:02:06,710 --> 00:02:10,172
-I stayed up till 10.
-After 9, Rhett was asleep.

10
00:02:10,172 --> 00:02:12,174
-Who's driving them?
-I will.

11
00:02:12,174 --> 00:02:16,178
Nicki's selling coffee at school,
I'm helping her.

12
00:02:17,179 --> 00:02:18,472
It sucks.

13
00:02:18,472 --> 00:02:22,476
Do not say "sucks," say "disappoints."

14
00:02:25,187 --> 00:02:27,898
I don't need a lunch.
I'll go with Tash.

15
00:02:27,898 --> 00:02:30,901
Eat pizza three days in a row?
I think not.

16
00:02:30,901 --> 00:02:33,320
That's really good.

17
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:35,739
The proportions are perfect...

18
00:02:35,739 --> 00:02:38,909
...but do you draw
what you really see?

19
00:02:38,909 --> 00:02:42,913
The simplest is the hardest.
Seeing what's in front of you.

20
00:02:55,968 --> 00:02:57,928
What's on for tonight?

21
00:02:57,928 --> 00:03:01,932
I am so grounded. I got busted
sneaking back inside last night.

22
00:03:02,641 --> 00:03:06,645
-Damn, how'd you manage that?
-My dad set the motion detector.

23
00:03:06,770 --> 00:03:10,232
Our parents are getting
paranoid in their old age.

24
00:03:10,232 --> 00:03:14,236
Mine still trust me.

25
00:03:15,612 --> 00:03:19,616
It's beautiful.

26
00:03:19,658 --> 00:03:21,952
Not a bad couple of decades.

27
00:03:21,952 --> 00:03:24,830
Better than the first two
without you.

28
00:03:24,830 --> 00:03:28,834
To 20 years of you and me.

29
00:03:31,670 --> 00:03:35,674
And to our children, safe at home.

30
00:03:42,598 --> 00:03:44,391
Hey, cool, you lost them!

31
00:03:44,391 --> 00:03:47,519
Macho Mustang boys, to boot!

32
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:51,523
-We struck a blow for sisterhood!
-The only "blow" you know.

33
00:03:51,565 --> 00:03:53,859
Diss.

34
00:03:53,859 --> 00:03:56,570
-Any raves?
-Full Moon Underground.

35
00:03:56,570 --> 00:03:59,573
San Bernardino.
Probably Saturday.

36
00:03:59,573 --> 00:04:02,034
I'll tell Mom I'm staying with you.

37
00:04:02,034 --> 00:04:05,454
I can't believe you
still work that scam.

38
00:04:05,454 --> 00:04:09,458
What can I say?
My 'rents are clueless.

39
00:04:10,584 --> 00:04:13,295
I'll bring glowsticks if you buy gas.

40
00:04:13,295 --> 00:04:17,049
-That's such a good idea!
-Nice try, Beams.

41
00:04:17,049 --> 00:04:19,593
Rest, it'll be one hell of a weekend.

42
00:04:19,593 --> 00:04:23,555
-Bye, Tasha.
-Don't let the bedbugs bite!

43
00:04:28,018 --> 00:04:32,022
Hasta!

44
00:04:47,037 --> 00:04:51,041
Now they call the cops on me.

45
00:04:58,757 --> 00:05:02,761
Hello!

46
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:08,475
Hello!

47
00:05:08,475 --> 00:05:11,061
I'm sorry I'm late.

48
00:05:11,061 --> 00:05:14,898
Ruby Baker?

49
00:05:14,898 --> 00:05:18,902
Yeah, I'm Ruby.

50
00:05:19,486 --> 00:05:23,407
Whatever they said, I'm not missing.
I just went out.

51
00:05:24,992 --> 00:05:27,703
Your parents were in a car accident.

52
00:05:27,703 --> 00:05:30,539
Are they okay?

53
00:05:30,539 --> 00:05:34,501
-Ruby, why don't you have a seat, hon?
-Are they okay?

54
00:05:34,501 --> 00:05:38,088
My partner will help you have a seat.
Ruby.

55
00:05:38,088 --> 00:05:40,090
-I can sit down myself.
-I know.

56
00:05:40,090 --> 00:05:41,383
Are they okay?

57
00:05:41,383 --> 00:05:44,511
-Relax.
-We're here to help you.

58
00:05:44,511 --> 00:05:45,971
You'll be okay.

59
00:05:45,971 --> 00:05:49,975
Relax. Ruby?

60
00:05:52,853 --> 00:05:54,521
Ruby.

61
00:05:54,521 --> 00:05:55,814
You'll be okay.

62
00:05:55,814 --> 00:05:59,818
-Get her pulse.
-Can you hear me, Ruby?

63
00:06:03,697 --> 00:06:05,699
"They are as asleep.

64
00:06:05,699 --> 00:06:09,119
In the morning, they're like grass
which groweth up.

65
00:06:09,119 --> 00:06:12,414
In the morning, it flourisheth
and groweth up.

66
00:06:12,414 --> 00:06:16,168
In the evening, it is cut down
and withereth...

67
00:06:16,168 --> 00:06:20,172
...for we're consumed by thine anger
and by thy wrath we're troubled.

68
00:06:21,423 --> 00:06:25,427
Thou has set our iniquities
before thee, our secret sins...

69
00:06:25,552 --> 00:06:28,055
...in the light of thy countenance.

70
00:06:28,055 --> 00:06:31,934
For all our days are
passed away in thy wrath.

71
00:06:31,934 --> 00:06:34,937
We spend our years as
a tale that is told...

72
00:06:34,937 --> 00:06:37,898
...so teach us to number our days...

73
00:06:37,898 --> 00:06:41,902
...that we may apply
our hearts unto wisdom."

74
00:06:41,902 --> 00:06:45,864
I think Rhett Baker wants to
say something. Rhett?

75
00:07:03,090 --> 00:07:07,094
I just--

76
00:07:07,928 --> 00:07:11,890
I just wanna say....

77
00:07:19,523 --> 00:07:21,108
I just....

78
00:07:21,108 --> 00:07:25,112
It's okay.

79
00:07:29,074 --> 00:07:33,078
I didn't work with Dave and Grace
or see them every day...

80
00:07:33,245 --> 00:07:35,956
...but I knew them for 10 years...

81
00:07:35,956 --> 00:07:39,960
...and I'm sure if they
could hear this....

82
00:07:41,211 --> 00:07:43,130
Well, Grace...

83
00:07:43,130 --> 00:07:47,134
...would do her dismissive
little giggle.

84
00:07:47,217 --> 00:07:49,219
You know the one.

85
00:07:49,219 --> 00:07:53,223
And Dave would mutter
an "expletive deleted."

86
00:07:57,603 --> 00:08:00,689
They'd hate to be remembered
as anything but...

87
00:08:00,689 --> 00:08:04,151
...ordinary.

88
00:08:04,151 --> 00:08:07,696
Which is exactly what they were:

89
00:08:07,696 --> 00:08:11,700
Anything but ordinary.

90
00:08:12,034 --> 00:08:14,828
But they will live on...

91
00:08:14,828 --> 00:08:18,832
...through their children
and in all our hearts.

92
00:08:24,296 --> 00:08:27,049
Ruby?

93
00:08:27,049 --> 00:08:29,718
Do you remember me?

94
00:08:29,718 --> 00:08:32,638
I'm Uncle Jack,
your mom's brother.

95
00:08:32,638 --> 00:08:36,642
I'll go wait by the car, okay?

96
00:08:38,060 --> 00:08:41,647
If there's anything that you need...

97
00:08:41,647 --> 00:08:43,857
...anything I can do...

98
00:08:43,857 --> 00:08:47,861
...I don't mean in the next few weeks
or months, I mean anytime.

99
00:08:49,738 --> 00:08:53,742
How come I haven't seen you
in, like, 10 years?

100
00:08:54,034 --> 00:08:57,037
Have you even met my brother Rhett?

101
00:08:57,037 --> 00:08:59,331
Well, of course I have.

102
00:08:59,331 --> 00:09:02,042
I haven't seen either of you in years.

103
00:09:02,042 --> 00:09:05,963
First of all, I live pretty far away.
Chicago.

104
00:09:06,088 --> 00:09:08,882
Then how will you help us?

105
00:09:08,882 --> 00:09:12,803
I don't know.
There's the phone, e-mail.

106
00:09:12,803 --> 00:09:16,807
-You and my mom never wrote.
-That's true.

107
00:09:17,057 --> 00:09:20,352
As siblings get older,
they go separate ways.

108
00:09:20,352 --> 00:09:24,231
-You and Rhett are close now--
-We're not.

109
00:09:24,231 --> 00:09:27,901
We have nothing in common.

110
00:09:27,901 --> 00:09:31,822
Used to feel that way about your mom.
It's not true.

111
00:09:31,989 --> 00:09:35,993
I used to think I'd take a month off
and come out here...

112
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:40,664
...and get to know you,
your brother and Grace again.

113
00:09:41,832 --> 00:09:45,836
Nice to see you.
Sorry things didn't work out.

114
00:09:53,677 --> 00:09:57,681
-I'll call you later, okay?
-Okay.

115
00:10:17,993 --> 00:10:21,705
Ruby? Hi.

116
00:10:21,705 --> 00:10:25,292
-I'm Alvin Begleiter.
-Hi.

117
00:10:25,292 --> 00:10:28,128
I'm so sorry.

118
00:10:28,128 --> 00:10:32,132
I'm your--
I was your parents' estate lawyer.

119
00:10:33,467 --> 00:10:35,886
I planned their wills...

120
00:10:35,886 --> 00:10:39,890
...what they wanted to do
with their money and--

121
00:10:41,642 --> 00:10:45,646
The most important issue right now
is who'll take care of you.

122
00:10:46,939 --> 00:10:48,357
You and Rhett.

123
00:10:48,357 --> 00:10:51,735
I'm assuming you know the Glasses?

124
00:10:51,735 --> 00:10:54,780
I've known them my whole life.

125
00:10:54,780 --> 00:10:57,282
Good. I know that your parents...

126
00:10:57,282 --> 00:11:01,286
...chose them after a great deal
of consideration.

127
00:11:01,286 --> 00:11:03,455
And there's something else.

128
00:11:03,455 --> 00:11:07,084
Your parents were extremely thrifty...

129
00:11:07,084 --> 00:11:11,088
...and with your mom's share,
your dad's life insurance...

130
00:11:13,799 --> 00:11:17,803
...there's enough for you
and Rhett for the rest of your lives.

131
00:11:19,054 --> 00:11:23,058
Obviously you don't know Rhett.

132
00:11:23,767 --> 00:11:27,271
That's good.
I'll give you one of my cards.

133
00:11:27,271 --> 00:11:29,815
I don't expect trouble.

134
00:11:29,815 --> 00:11:33,819
But if you have any concerns,
any problems....

135
00:11:34,903 --> 00:11:38,365
I'm an estate lawyer
and also a trust lawyer.

136
00:11:38,365 --> 00:11:42,369
I want to be someone you can trust.

137
00:11:47,833 --> 00:11:51,128
-You call me, okay?
-Okay.

138
00:11:51,128 --> 00:11:55,132
Mr. Glass.

139
00:11:57,134 --> 00:12:01,138
-Ruby.
-Thank you.

140
00:12:01,305 --> 00:12:05,309
My mom and dad would've
loved that speech.

141
00:12:06,310 --> 00:12:10,314
-They would've loved it.
-Come here.

142
00:12:12,149 --> 00:12:16,153
That's good.
We're gonna get through this.

143
00:12:17,029 --> 00:12:20,991
We'll get through it together, okay?

144
00:12:24,953 --> 00:12:27,247
Oh, Ruby.

145
00:12:27,247 --> 00:12:31,251
You're in good hands.

146
00:12:58,570 --> 00:13:00,781
Hey!

147
00:13:00,781 --> 00:13:04,785
-You guys ready for Malibu?
-It'll be a change, we won't lie.

148
00:13:05,786 --> 00:13:07,579
It's not the worst place.

149
00:13:07,579 --> 00:13:11,583
-Is this your car?
-My company's, on loan for today.

150
00:14:00,591 --> 00:14:04,595
Sweet!

151
00:14:04,928 --> 00:14:08,932
This place is huge!

152
00:14:11,268 --> 00:14:14,021
Hey, Rubes, check out this view.

153
00:14:14,021 --> 00:14:18,025
Yeah, it's pretty amazing.

154
00:14:21,987 --> 00:14:25,991
-Cool, a meteorite!
-It's art, Rhett.

155
00:14:26,950 --> 00:14:30,454
Give them the tour.
Stall them, I'll order dinner.

156
00:14:30,454 --> 00:14:34,458
Let's get the lay of the land.

157
00:14:38,128 --> 00:14:41,340
Master suite.

158
00:14:41,340 --> 00:14:45,052
Home gym.

159
00:14:45,052 --> 00:14:48,055
-Home theater.
-Sweet.

160
00:14:48,055 --> 00:14:52,059
-You never have to leave home.
-If only.

161
00:14:52,142 --> 00:14:54,353
Vicki comes in most days.

162
00:14:54,353 --> 00:14:56,271
-Hola, niños.
-Hola.

163
00:14:56,271 --> 00:15:00,150
Hello!

164
00:15:00,150 --> 00:15:03,946
This is your room.

165
00:15:03,946 --> 00:15:07,491
It's temporary quarters, of course.

166
00:15:07,491 --> 00:15:11,495
Unpack, get settled,
and I'll meet you in the kitchen.

167
00:15:15,499 --> 00:15:19,503
We're sharing a room?

168
00:15:22,381 --> 00:15:26,343
Glance at me when I'm changing
and you're busted.

169
00:15:27,052 --> 00:15:31,056
We have a little calamari,
a little risotto with mushrooms...

170
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:37,104
...and green salad with
some Swiss chard.

171
00:15:43,235 --> 00:15:47,239
-Do you have any Garfield?
-What is that?

172
00:15:47,239 --> 00:15:51,243
-It's crap in a can.
-If it's crap, how come you eat it?

173
00:15:51,535 --> 00:15:55,539
-Come on, kids. Try the calamari.
-Isn't that squid?

174
00:16:02,087 --> 00:16:06,091
-Honey, tonight....
-I'll call Domino's.

175
00:16:06,550 --> 00:16:10,554
Thank you.

176
00:16:24,234 --> 00:16:27,738
Can you turn and face the wall?

177
00:16:27,738 --> 00:16:29,698
Who are you, the Blair Witch?

178
00:16:29,698 --> 00:16:33,577
I'm worse. Just face the wall.

179
00:16:33,577 --> 00:16:37,581
Turn that stupid thing off!

180
00:17:27,756 --> 00:17:30,801
There's public school,
then there's public school.

181
00:17:30,801 --> 00:17:34,638
Trust me, there won't be any
Bloods or Crips.

182
00:17:34,638 --> 00:17:37,349
I'm not scared of getting gunned down.

183
00:17:37,349 --> 00:17:41,228
-You're a great kid--
-It's not about being great.

184
00:17:41,228 --> 00:17:44,189
-It's about being....
-New?

185
00:17:44,189 --> 00:17:47,067
Middle-of-the-year new.

186
00:17:47,067 --> 00:17:51,071
There's a saying we teach
the Pain Ward patients.

187
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:54,658
"This too shall pass."

188
00:17:54,658 --> 00:17:58,662
This too shall pass.
This too shall pass.

189
00:18:01,540 --> 00:18:02,791
Hi.

190
00:18:02,791 --> 00:18:06,795
Why don't you take
a seat in the back?

191
00:18:15,846 --> 00:18:18,432
We have a new addition.

192
00:18:18,432 --> 00:18:22,436
Would you introduce yourself,
Miss Baker?

193
00:18:23,562 --> 00:18:27,566
You just did.

194
00:18:31,570 --> 00:18:34,865
Hi.

195
00:18:34,865 --> 00:18:38,869
I'm Ruby Baker.

196
00:18:39,453 --> 00:18:43,457
I used to go to Shady Lane.
That's in the Valley.

197
00:18:44,708 --> 00:18:48,712
Not my choice,
just an accident of birth.

198
00:18:49,463 --> 00:18:52,466
How come you moved here?

199
00:18:52,466 --> 00:18:56,428
It was another accident.

200
00:18:57,596 --> 00:19:01,600
Let's make Ruby feel welcome.

201
00:19:15,739 --> 00:19:19,743
Thanks for the lift.

202
00:19:20,327 --> 00:19:24,331
Sweet!

203
00:19:26,208 --> 00:19:28,627
I can't believe it!

204
00:19:28,627 --> 00:19:31,630
Like one of those isn't noisy enough?

205
00:19:31,630 --> 00:19:35,634
No, Rubes. You can't play
"Pokémon Snap" on PlayStation.

206
00:19:35,968 --> 00:19:39,805
You can play "Ape Escape,"
but not on N-64.

207
00:19:39,805 --> 00:19:43,809
Mom and Dad would freak out.

208
00:19:44,351 --> 00:19:48,355
Don't talk about them.

209
00:20:08,667 --> 00:20:11,962
I haven't seen one girl
with blue-black hair.

210
00:20:11,962 --> 00:20:15,966
The guys surf and swim all day.
That sun-worshiping culture.

211
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:18,385
That sounds hot.

212
00:20:18,385 --> 00:20:22,389
I checked my pager all day.
I figured you'd call and you didn't.

213
00:20:23,390 --> 00:20:27,311
Cell phones are banned at school.
The kids don't care.

214
00:20:27,853 --> 00:20:30,814
They can't see they
lost their liberties.

215
00:20:30,814 --> 00:20:34,693
They have so much sunstroke,
they're wasted.

216
00:20:34,693 --> 00:20:38,697
Ruby?

217
00:20:40,324 --> 00:20:43,994
I got us an assortment
of different things.

218
00:20:43,994 --> 00:20:47,998
Some cold pastas, some salads.

219
00:20:52,419 --> 00:20:56,340
Ruby, I think that you'd be
well-served by a better attitude.

220
00:21:02,888 --> 00:21:06,892
It's okay. I don't mind take-out.
You're busy.

221
00:21:06,892 --> 00:21:08,727
It's not from Wendy's.

222
00:21:08,727 --> 00:21:12,731
I meant your attitude
toward your new school.

223
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:18,904
-My attitude?
-I overheard your conversation.

224
00:21:20,030 --> 00:21:21,907
You were listening in?

225
00:21:21,907 --> 00:21:25,911
No, I was trying to get a line out,
but that's beside the point.

226
00:21:26,912 --> 00:21:30,499
The point is, you need those
kids to like you.

227
00:21:30,499 --> 00:21:33,627
Otherwise, you'll isolate,
sabotage yourself.

228
00:21:33,627 --> 00:21:37,631
-You'll have a miserable time.
-Okay, I get it.

229
00:21:43,512 --> 00:21:47,516
I learned something.

230
00:21:53,522 --> 00:21:55,524
Ruby?

231
00:21:55,524 --> 00:21:57,776
Ruby.

232
00:21:57,776 --> 00:22:01,780
-Wake up.
-I'm awake.

233
00:22:02,781 --> 00:22:06,785
-Wake up.
-Mommy?

234
00:22:08,495 --> 00:22:12,499
Mommy?

235
00:23:20,192 --> 00:23:23,445
You scared the crap out of me.

236
00:23:23,445 --> 00:23:27,449
I heard noises. I thought
it was a burglar or coyote.

237
00:23:27,574 --> 00:23:31,203
I'm not used to kids here.

238
00:23:31,203 --> 00:23:35,207
Come here.

239
00:23:39,044 --> 00:23:43,048
Thank you.

240
00:23:51,807 --> 00:23:54,601
You must be freezing.

241
00:23:54,601 --> 00:23:58,605
No more 3 a.m. swims. With all
the glass, you hear everything.

242
00:23:59,523 --> 00:24:02,943
I'll set the alarm at night.

243
00:24:02,943 --> 00:24:06,947
Are you coming?

244
00:24:13,203 --> 00:24:15,956
Drunk driving among teens has...

245
00:24:15,956 --> 00:24:19,251
...steadily decreased,
but we can do better.

246
00:24:19,251 --> 00:24:22,004
As these images starkly attest...

247
00:24:22,004 --> 00:24:26,008
...alcohol remains the No. 1
problem among teens.

248
00:24:26,842 --> 00:24:30,846
This year, 20 percent
of teenage drivers....

249
00:24:55,621 --> 00:24:59,625
How was your first day
of Driver's Ed?

250
00:24:59,875 --> 00:25:03,879
-Fine, I guess.
-They still show gruesome movies?

251
00:25:04,713 --> 00:25:06,715
Those were the Dark Ages.

252
00:25:06,715 --> 00:25:10,302
They have better ways
of teaching kids today.

253
00:25:10,302 --> 00:25:14,306
May I be excused?

254
00:25:22,856 --> 00:25:26,777
Stupid, kid-proof piece of crap.

255
00:25:28,612 --> 00:25:32,616
Ruby?

256
00:25:32,658 --> 00:25:36,662
Was it awful?
I mean, the driving class?

257
00:25:37,329 --> 00:25:41,333
-I can just imagine.
-No, it's....

258
00:25:44,253 --> 00:25:48,257
I have my period.

259
00:25:49,049 --> 00:25:53,053
Come with me.

260
00:26:04,189 --> 00:26:08,193
Thank you.

261
00:26:15,617 --> 00:26:18,787
Four doctors recommend....

262
00:26:18,787 --> 00:26:22,791
This cramp, too, shall pass.

263
00:26:25,252 --> 00:26:29,214
I'll turn it off
when I get to a save point.

264
00:26:30,382 --> 00:26:34,386
It's cool. I don't care.

265
00:26:35,262 --> 00:26:39,224
It's kind of relaxing.

266
00:27:02,289 --> 00:27:05,709
Erin, get out of there!

267
00:27:05,709 --> 00:27:09,129
What were you doing in there?
Tell me the truth!

268
00:27:09,129 --> 00:27:11,423
-What are you implying?
-Tell me!

269
00:27:11,423 --> 00:27:14,426
No, I won't answer you!
Good night!

270
00:27:14,426 --> 00:27:18,430
-What the hell are you doing?
-Getting ready for bed.

271
00:27:18,722 --> 00:27:22,726
-Watch your language.
-Don't play games with me.

272
00:27:22,851 --> 00:27:25,312
You know what I'm talking about.

273
00:27:25,312 --> 00:27:29,316
I'm too tired to guess.
I'm sick of your accusations.

274
00:27:29,483 --> 00:27:32,444
Is that what you call it now?

275
00:27:32,444 --> 00:27:34,655
-How many--
-I've done every--

276
00:27:34,655 --> 00:27:38,659
You told me you--

277
00:27:48,335 --> 00:27:49,962
Ruby?

278
00:27:49,962 --> 00:27:53,924
-Hi, I'm Hannah.
-Hi.

279
00:27:54,341 --> 00:27:58,262
There's this rumor you were
on academic probation.

280
00:27:59,179 --> 00:28:01,348
Cut to the chase, huh?

281
00:28:01,348 --> 00:28:05,352
I was. I had sex with the dean
and he took it off my record.

282
00:28:07,104 --> 00:28:09,189
Oh, not really.

283
00:28:09,189 --> 00:28:12,401
I was supposed to be at
my friend Tasha's...

284
00:28:12,401 --> 00:28:15,946
...doing an essay,
and went to this rave.

285
00:28:15,946 --> 00:28:19,950
Sunday I was fried and
downloaded this thing off the net.

286
00:28:20,909 --> 00:28:24,413
-Tuesday, I was busted.
-Hey, Hannah!

287
00:28:24,413 --> 00:28:28,417
-Hey! I gotta go.
-Bye.

288
00:28:40,012 --> 00:28:41,972
Hey, Ruby.

289
00:28:41,972 --> 00:28:45,017
My company's driving people
to a premiere.

290
00:28:45,017 --> 00:28:48,979
I gotta make sure everything
runs smooth. Wanna come?

291
00:28:49,104 --> 00:28:53,108
I have homework, three more hours.
Pretty heavy, so....

292
00:28:54,735 --> 00:28:58,739
That's perfect.

293
00:29:04,244 --> 00:29:08,248
Can we catch the end of the movie
or go to the party?

294
00:29:16,340 --> 00:29:18,884
Actually, the hell with Westwood.

295
00:29:18,884 --> 00:29:22,888
-My drivers can handle a premiere.
-Evening, sir.

296
00:29:23,597 --> 00:29:26,850
Mud pie for the lady.
Ketel One, rocks, for me.

297
00:29:26,850 --> 00:29:28,894
Great.

298
00:29:28,894 --> 00:29:30,270
Thank you.

299
00:29:30,270 --> 00:29:34,191
That party'd be a mob scene.
I really want to talk to you.

300
00:29:35,567 --> 00:29:38,904
-Here you are.
-Thank you.

301
00:29:38,904 --> 00:29:42,908
I remember when you guys moved
down the block 11 years ago.

302
00:29:43,784 --> 00:29:47,788
It was funny. I noticed the furniture
as they brought it in.

303
00:29:48,372 --> 00:29:51,208
Erin noticed a little girl.

304
00:29:51,208 --> 00:29:55,212
But you were upset.
I guess about moving cross-country.

305
00:29:57,172 --> 00:29:59,091
You wouldn't say a word.

306
00:29:59,091 --> 00:30:03,095
Just hugged this plastic doll
against your chest.

307
00:30:03,512 --> 00:30:07,516
Malibu Barbie, I think it was.
Prophetic, huh?

308
00:30:07,516 --> 00:30:11,103
Think you mean "pathetic."

309
00:30:11,103 --> 00:30:15,065
No, no.

310
00:30:17,192 --> 00:30:21,196
-I guess you moved on years ago.
-From what?

311
00:30:22,990 --> 00:30:26,994
From hugging plastic dolls.

312
00:30:29,288 --> 00:30:33,292
I should hope so.

313
00:30:37,129 --> 00:30:40,549
Last night, when you fought...

314
00:30:40,549 --> 00:30:42,551
...it wasn't about us, right?

315
00:30:42,551 --> 00:30:46,555
No. Married people sometimes
like to...

316
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:49,516
...push each other's buttons.

317
00:30:49,516 --> 00:30:53,437
It's a form of intimacy,
a lower form, nothing serious.

318
00:30:55,314 --> 00:30:59,276
One thing I haven't said about Erin:

319
00:31:00,444 --> 00:31:04,406
It can be lonely living with her.

320
00:31:08,327 --> 00:31:12,331
But that's my cross to bear,
not yours.

321
00:31:19,171 --> 00:31:23,175
I think it's past my bedtime, Terry.

322
00:31:23,175 --> 00:31:25,552
Of course it is.

323
00:31:25,552 --> 00:31:29,473
Let's get you to bed.

324
00:32:03,382 --> 00:32:07,344
Terry.

325
00:32:07,594 --> 00:32:11,515
You're not wearing
your shoulder belt.

326
00:32:33,287 --> 00:32:35,080
Hey.

327
00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:39,126
Try not to make too much noise.
Rhett and Erin are asleep.

328
00:32:40,794 --> 00:32:44,715
Okay?

329
00:33:18,290 --> 00:33:22,044
Hamlet senses something's wrong...

330
00:33:22,044 --> 00:33:24,588
...that he alone can set right.

331
00:33:24,588 --> 00:33:27,633
I want two pages next Friday...

332
00:33:27,633 --> 00:33:31,595
...about what he means
and whether he succeeds.

333
00:33:47,486 --> 00:33:51,490
Mr. Begleiter, before my parents--

334
00:33:52,324 --> 00:33:56,328
They ever speak about
guardians for Rhett and me?

335
00:33:57,329 --> 00:34:01,333
Different from the Glasses? No.

336
00:34:01,333 --> 00:34:05,337
-I think they wanted to.
-They discussed it with you?

337
00:34:05,504 --> 00:34:09,508
No, but my parents weren't
friendly with them after they moved.

338
00:34:10,092 --> 00:34:12,886
Ruby, the Glasses aren't your parents.

339
00:34:12,886 --> 00:34:15,347
They'll never be your parents.

340
00:34:15,347 --> 00:34:19,351
-If Erin or Terry has done anything--
-We sleep in one room.

341
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:22,896
That's not ideal.

342
00:34:22,896 --> 00:34:26,817
The other night we were alone
in Terry's car. He--

343
00:34:27,359 --> 00:34:30,279
What? What did he do?

344
00:34:30,279 --> 00:34:34,283
He just put my seat belt on.

345
00:34:34,825 --> 00:34:38,829
The way he leaned across me wasn't--
It just-- And I felt....

346
00:34:40,914 --> 00:34:44,126
I know it sounds stupid.

347
00:34:44,126 --> 00:34:45,544
And then...

348
00:34:45,544 --> 00:34:49,548
...Erin was shooting up.
I saw her holding a needle.

349
00:34:50,674 --> 00:34:54,136
Anyway, she looked really baked.

350
00:34:54,136 --> 00:34:58,140
Ruby.

351
00:34:59,683 --> 00:35:02,394
Ruby.

352
00:35:02,394 --> 00:35:05,939
Try and understand this.

353
00:35:05,939 --> 00:35:09,401
The accident, in effect...

354
00:35:09,401 --> 00:35:12,279
...orphaned you and your brother.

355
00:35:12,279 --> 00:35:16,283
So if this doesn't work out
with the Glasses...

356
00:35:16,700 --> 00:35:19,286
...you've no place to go.

357
00:35:19,286 --> 00:35:23,290
You'll become wards of the state.

358
00:35:23,290 --> 00:35:26,585
I'm not trying to scare you.

359
00:35:26,585 --> 00:35:30,589
I'm just telling you the facts of life.

360
00:35:33,175 --> 00:35:36,303
I drove halfway here
with the housekeeper...

361
00:35:36,303 --> 00:35:39,848
...and then hitchhiked
and I was scared.

362
00:35:39,848 --> 00:35:43,852
But I told myself once I made it,
you'd help me and Rhett.

363
00:35:55,322 --> 00:35:59,326
When we met, you said
I could trust you.

364
00:36:03,622 --> 00:36:06,208
Okay.

365
00:36:06,208 --> 00:36:10,212
All right.

366
00:36:11,338 --> 00:36:15,342
I believe you. And I know
who to get in touch with.

367
00:36:16,885 --> 00:36:20,889
It's not gonna be easy.
I can't promise you results.

368
00:36:22,224 --> 00:36:26,228
But I promise you that I'll look
into this. You have my word on that.

369
00:36:28,522 --> 00:36:31,984
Thank you.

370
00:36:31,984 --> 00:36:35,988
When we spoke after the funeral...

371
00:36:36,822 --> 00:36:39,658
...you had said that...

372
00:36:39,658 --> 00:36:42,661
...we had more than enough.

373
00:36:42,661 --> 00:36:45,789
How much would that be exactly?

374
00:36:45,789 --> 00:36:49,793
That's a question for the
trust officer at the bank.

375
00:36:51,253 --> 00:36:55,257
But between us,
four million dollars.

376
00:36:58,010 --> 00:37:02,014
So you can see,
you're financially very secure.

377
00:37:03,849 --> 00:37:06,810
Yeah.

378
00:37:06,810 --> 00:37:10,814
Now why don't you go home.
And do me one more favor?

379
00:37:10,856 --> 00:37:13,317
No hitchhiking.

380
00:37:13,317 --> 00:37:17,321
-This is out, okay?
-Yes, sir.

381
00:37:36,423 --> 00:37:40,427
Alvin Begleiter calling.

382
00:37:41,720 --> 00:37:45,724
I just had a disturbing visit
from Ruby Baker.

383
00:37:52,439 --> 00:37:56,026
Rhett, why don't you leave that now?

384
00:37:56,026 --> 00:37:58,737
Go and do some homework.

385
00:37:58,737 --> 00:38:02,741
I have a lot of homework too.

386
00:38:02,741 --> 00:38:06,745
Stay a minute, would you?

387
00:38:06,870 --> 00:38:10,874
What you saw last night
isn't what you think.

388
00:38:10,916 --> 00:38:14,795
Erin suffers from diabetes.

389
00:38:14,795 --> 00:38:16,630
I hid it.

390
00:38:16,630 --> 00:38:20,634
I don't want you or Rhett to worry.
The disease is under control.

391
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:25,764
You saw Erin giving herself
her nightly insulin injection.

392
00:38:26,932 --> 00:38:30,894
Must've been a shock to walk in on.

393
00:38:32,646 --> 00:38:35,399
One more thing.

394
00:38:35,399 --> 00:38:39,403
Terry tells me that you got a
little skittish with him last night.

395
00:38:43,657 --> 00:38:47,661
That makes us feel sad.
We want you to trust us, Ruby.

396
00:38:48,662 --> 00:38:52,499
We need your trust.

397
00:38:52,499 --> 00:38:55,961
I overreacted, I'm sorry.

398
00:38:55,961 --> 00:38:59,673
There're still things
I need to get used to.

399
00:38:59,673 --> 00:39:02,134
We all do.

400
00:39:02,134 --> 00:39:06,138
We're all under stress.

401
00:39:08,140 --> 00:39:12,144
I'm gonna begin my Hamlet paper.

402
00:39:12,144 --> 00:39:16,148
If you need help, let me know.

403
00:39:17,566 --> 00:39:21,570
That'd be great.

404
00:39:27,868 --> 00:39:31,872
That's fine. Put it in park
and step out.

405
00:39:33,707 --> 00:39:37,628
And Ruby? You'll get behind
the wheel next.

406
00:39:43,884 --> 00:39:47,846
You can apply a bit more gas.

407
00:39:53,894 --> 00:39:56,438
Sorry, I'm a bad driver.

408
00:39:56,438 --> 00:39:59,733
There aren't any bad,
just inexperienced.

409
00:39:59,733 --> 00:40:03,737
Take a breath, start driving back.

410
00:40:11,203 --> 00:40:15,165
Bye.

411
00:40:32,224 --> 00:40:33,225
He's not in now.
I'll have him call you back.

412
00:40:33,225 --> 00:40:37,229
He's not in now.
I'll have him call you back.

413
00:40:38,939 --> 00:40:40,941
Hi.

414
00:40:40,941 --> 00:40:44,903
-I'm Ruby Baker. Terry's--
-I know who you are.

415
00:40:45,612 --> 00:40:48,657
Okay. Cool.

416
00:40:48,657 --> 00:40:51,076
I came to catch a ride from Terry.

417
00:40:51,076 --> 00:40:54,538
He's having a powwow with
some people now.

418
00:40:54,538 --> 00:40:58,542
-If you wanna wait, there's a lounge.
-Okay, thanks.

419
00:40:59,126 --> 00:41:03,088
-Glass Transit, may I help you?
-Any service technician to the office.

420
00:41:12,806 --> 00:41:16,226
-What's going on, Terry?
-The usual.

421
00:41:16,226 --> 00:41:20,230
Not to worry.
Nothing that can't be handled.

422
00:41:20,564 --> 00:41:24,568
-We had a payment plan.
-The dates arrive, the money doesn't.

423
00:41:25,611 --> 00:41:29,281
About that payment plan.
Nicole had a day...

424
00:41:29,281 --> 00:41:31,825
...I'd call it unrealistic.

425
00:41:31,825 --> 00:41:34,536
-You proposed that plan.
-I know.

426
00:41:34,536 --> 00:41:38,540
-It's not dishonesty. We gotta--
-What is it?

427
00:41:38,707 --> 00:41:42,711
Naïve optimism.

428
00:41:42,878 --> 00:41:46,298
But I'm an optimist by nature.

429
00:41:46,298 --> 00:41:50,302
I'm betting on myself.

430
00:41:51,929 --> 00:41:55,933
I'll be right there.

431
00:42:10,030 --> 00:42:14,034
-Where's the money?
-You're not listening. The money--

432
00:42:16,203 --> 00:42:20,165
-Say is, as in, "the money is."
-Yeah.

433
00:42:50,279 --> 00:42:52,239
Can I help you?

434
00:42:52,239 --> 00:42:56,243
-Whose car is this?
-Hell if I know. Showed up one day.

435
00:42:56,243 --> 00:43:00,205
-One day, when?
-I don't know. Few months ago?

436
00:43:01,081 --> 00:43:05,085
-We had a car like this.
-You really shouldn't be back here.

437
00:43:06,670 --> 00:43:09,214
Ruby?

438
00:43:09,214 --> 00:43:12,718
Ruby?

439
00:43:12,718 --> 00:43:16,722
What happened was nothing.
Just a business glitch.

440
00:43:18,098 --> 00:43:22,102
Hope you didn't get freaked.
People get weird about money.

441
00:43:24,104 --> 00:43:28,108
I didn't mean to just show up.
I waited for Vicki and she never came.

442
00:43:30,277 --> 00:43:34,281
We had to let her go.
Erin got held up at the hospital.

443
00:43:34,406 --> 00:43:38,410
-Back up. You had to let Vicki go?
-We had to.

444
00:43:38,994 --> 00:43:41,413
She drove you without permission.

445
00:43:41,413 --> 00:43:45,334
Just to Santa Monica,
to the Promenade.

446
00:43:47,294 --> 00:43:50,005
How did you know that she drove me?

447
00:43:50,005 --> 00:43:54,009
How did we know? It's our job to know.

448
00:44:25,958 --> 00:44:29,962
-Did you have a hard day at work?
-It was fine, thanks.

449
00:45:19,803 --> 00:45:22,389
Hamlet.

450
00:45:22,389 --> 00:45:26,393
Don't you hate how he can't
make up his mind?

451
00:45:27,519 --> 00:45:31,440
To be, not be, not not be,
be, be not.

452
00:46:15,442 --> 00:46:19,446
My father drove a Saab.

453
00:48:11,475 --> 00:48:15,437
Terry!

454
00:48:15,437 --> 00:48:18,732
Thank you.

455
00:48:18,732 --> 00:48:22,319
For finishing my paper.

456
00:48:22,319 --> 00:48:26,323
That would be wrong.

457
00:48:38,502 --> 00:48:40,629
-Ruby.
-Yeah?

458
00:48:40,629 --> 00:48:44,341
Come with me.

459
00:48:44,341 --> 00:48:48,345
Sure.

460
00:48:56,228 --> 00:48:59,648
Ruby Baker? I'm Nancy Ryan.

461
00:48:59,648 --> 00:49:03,652
I'm an inspector with Social Services.

462
00:49:10,784 --> 00:49:14,788
Your lawyer said you
have problems with your guardians.

463
00:49:18,292 --> 00:49:22,296
Please relax and be open.
Everything said here stays private.

464
00:49:23,130 --> 00:49:26,425
Okay? So...

465
00:49:26,425 --> 00:49:28,594
...you're 16...

466
00:49:28,594 --> 00:49:32,598
...and your brother is 11,
and you share a bedroom?

467
00:49:32,973 --> 00:49:36,685
Yeah, for now.

468
00:49:36,685 --> 00:49:40,689
And you saw Erin Glass
injecting herself?

469
00:49:42,274 --> 00:49:46,278
-They said she has diabetes.
-Diabetes? I'm gonna check that.

470
00:49:49,573 --> 00:49:53,160
Now it's gonna be in writing twice.

471
00:49:53,160 --> 00:49:56,705
My word still won't count
next to the Glasses.

472
00:49:56,705 --> 00:50:00,709
Which is why I'll phone the Glasses
and ask them to meet me...

473
00:50:01,543 --> 00:50:03,629
...so I can verify everything.

474
00:50:03,629 --> 00:50:06,632
-Okay?
-But...

475
00:50:06,632 --> 00:50:10,177
...how can I live with them?

476
00:50:10,177 --> 00:50:14,181
-Do you wanna live with them?
-Sometimes things are fine.

477
00:50:15,182 --> 00:50:18,852
Last night, Terry helped me
with something...

478
00:50:18,852 --> 00:50:22,856
...but maybe that was
to keep me happy.

479
00:50:22,856 --> 00:50:26,485
I know this is scary for you,
but don't worry.

480
00:50:26,485 --> 00:50:30,489
We tell the guardians that we
perform a routine inspection.

481
00:50:32,032 --> 00:50:34,618
If it's still in progress...

482
00:50:34,618 --> 00:50:38,622
...you just act like we've
never met or spoken.

483
00:50:39,206 --> 00:50:43,210
You have no idea why I'm there. Okay?

484
00:50:55,389 --> 00:50:57,641
This is my husband, Terry Glass.

485
00:50:57,641 --> 00:50:59,601
-Hello.
-Hello.

486
00:50:59,601 --> 00:51:03,605
Is this necessary in the middle
of the day?

487
00:51:03,689 --> 00:51:06,900
We'll get this done
as quickly as possible.

488
00:51:06,900 --> 00:51:10,821
It's intrusive.
Let's get it over with.

489
00:51:17,202 --> 00:51:21,123
-May I...?
-Of course.

490
00:51:34,511 --> 00:51:37,514
Only one child sleeps here?

491
00:51:37,514 --> 00:51:39,600
Yes, Rhett.

492
00:51:39,600 --> 00:51:42,811
And the girl, Ruby,
she has her own room?

493
00:51:42,811 --> 00:51:46,815
-Of course.
-She's 16.

494
00:51:56,825 --> 00:52:00,829
Nice accommodations.

495
00:52:03,457 --> 00:52:06,418
The kids are home.
Do you want to meet them?

496
00:52:06,418 --> 00:52:10,339
Yes, I would. Just to say hi.

497
00:52:10,589 --> 00:52:14,593
But first, Dr. Glass,
may I look upstairs?

498
00:52:19,765 --> 00:52:23,185
This is awkward,
but it's also important.

499
00:52:23,185 --> 00:52:26,730
It's a matter of safety,
so there's nothing...

500
00:52:26,730 --> 00:52:30,734
...dangerous in easy reach.

501
00:52:48,502 --> 00:52:52,464
-"Humulin I and U."
-Diabetes. I'm insulin-dependent.

502
00:52:54,883 --> 00:52:58,887
We have it totally under control.

503
00:52:59,346 --> 00:53:03,350
It would appear that you do.

504
00:53:03,976 --> 00:53:07,980
Here's the two best kids in the world.

505
00:53:08,939 --> 00:53:11,900
Hi, you must be Rhett. I'm Nancy Ryan.

506
00:53:11,900 --> 00:53:13,527
Nice to meet you.

507
00:53:13,527 --> 00:53:17,531
So Rhett, how do you spend
your evenings?

508
00:53:17,656 --> 00:53:21,618
When I finish my homework, I read.

509
00:53:25,664 --> 00:53:29,585
And you must be Ruby.
You have a very nice room.

510
00:53:34,381 --> 00:53:38,260
You've made a wonderful home
for these children.

511
00:53:38,260 --> 00:53:42,264
-Thank you, Dr. Glass.
-Thank you.

512
00:53:44,516 --> 00:53:47,936
We'll see you out.

513
00:53:47,936 --> 00:53:51,940
You read? You lie.

514
00:53:52,024 --> 00:53:56,028
Guess who I learned from?

515
00:54:27,309 --> 00:54:31,313
Bye now.

516
00:54:57,965 --> 00:55:01,969
Why don't we order some dinner, hon?

517
00:55:14,356 --> 00:55:18,360
How do you like your new room?

518
00:55:18,485 --> 00:55:22,406
Couldn't have come at a better time.

519
00:55:45,512 --> 00:55:49,433
Come on, Mr. Begleiter.

520
00:56:09,703 --> 00:56:13,582
-Hello?
-Sorry to disturb you this late.

521
00:56:13,582 --> 00:56:17,586
But I found myself wondering,
"Where's the money?"

522
00:56:23,175 --> 00:56:25,052
You might as well know.

523
00:56:25,052 --> 00:56:29,056
Six months ago I took on a partner.
A silent partner and...

524
00:56:30,057 --> 00:56:34,061
...I recently found out
he was skimming cash.

525
00:56:35,020 --> 00:56:39,024
You've lost me. What does
this have to do with our loan?

526
00:56:41,610 --> 00:56:44,613
I'm waiting, Mr. Glass.

527
00:56:44,613 --> 00:56:48,617
-Mr. Glass, you still there?
-Yeah.

528
00:56:50,494 --> 00:56:53,956
He charged personal
expenses to the company.

529
00:56:53,956 --> 00:56:57,960
When I want a heartbreaking
human interest story...

530
00:56:58,627 --> 00:57:01,505
...I'll watch the news.

531
00:57:01,505 --> 00:57:05,509
Meanwhile, your payment's due
tomorrow, close of business.

532
00:57:06,677 --> 00:57:10,639
Do you fully understand me?

533
00:57:14,768 --> 00:57:17,229
Mr. Glass?

534
00:57:17,229 --> 00:57:20,941
I'm here.

535
00:57:20,941 --> 00:57:24,611
I'm seeking full restitution
from my partner.

536
00:57:24,611 --> 00:57:27,614
Plus I found a whole new
source of equity.

537
00:57:27,614 --> 00:57:30,242
My big, new, personal piggy bank.

538
00:57:30,242 --> 00:57:32,953
So you can expect another $30,000.

539
00:57:32,953 --> 00:57:36,957
That barely covers interest.
You need to pay off the principal.

540
00:57:37,958 --> 00:57:41,962
But I need some more time.
Not a lot more time.

541
00:57:42,254 --> 00:57:43,714
A week at the most.

542
00:57:43,714 --> 00:57:47,676
We'll give you two days,
because we like you.

543
00:57:47,968 --> 00:57:51,972
We'd hate for you to find
your beautiful house burnt down...

544
00:57:53,015 --> 00:57:57,019
...with your wife inside.

545
00:58:30,010 --> 00:58:34,014
Yeah?

546
00:58:37,601 --> 00:58:41,605
"I unfold a tale whose
word would harrow up thy soul...

547
00:58:41,605 --> 00:58:43,774
...freeze thy young blood...

548
00:58:43,774 --> 00:58:47,611
...make thy two eyes
start from their spheres...

549
00:58:47,611 --> 00:58:50,656
...and each hair to stand an end.

550
00:58:50,656 --> 00:58:52,950
If thou didst thy father love...

551
00:58:52,950 --> 00:58:56,912
...revenge his foul and unnatural
murder. Murder most foul...

552
00:58:58,038 --> 00:59:02,042
But this most foul,
strange, and unnatural...."

553
00:59:08,340 --> 00:59:09,758
Begleiterand Brice.

554
00:59:09,758 --> 00:59:13,762
-This is Ruby Baker for Mr. Begleiter.
-One moment.

555
00:59:17,891 --> 00:59:21,895
-Did you get my e-mail?
-No, Terry trashed my account.

556
00:59:22,896 --> 00:59:26,066
Or maybe the bill didn't get paid.

557
00:59:26,066 --> 00:59:28,819
Did you find out about the BMW?

558
00:59:28,819 --> 00:59:31,697
Right, the BMW.

559
00:59:31,697 --> 00:59:34,950
It was registered
to a business: G.T.l.

560
00:59:34,950 --> 00:59:37,661
Glass Transit Incorporated.

561
00:59:37,661 --> 00:59:41,665
-Terry's company.
-Now don't you get it?

562
00:59:42,708 --> 00:59:46,670
Ruby, please come with me.

563
00:59:47,129 --> 00:59:51,133
I have to call you back later.
Bye-bye.

564
00:59:52,259 --> 00:59:56,221
This is Miss Bassett,
our vice principal.

565
00:59:56,847 --> 00:59:58,265
Ruby.

566
00:59:58,265 --> 01:00:02,269
The paper you turned in to Mr. Kim,
that was your work, nobody helped?

567
01:00:03,145 --> 01:00:07,149
-No.
-Not even Harold Bloom?

568
01:00:07,149 --> 01:00:11,153
"Dance of contraries,"
didn't sound like a student.

569
01:00:11,278 --> 01:00:14,990
I found it and other phrases
in Mr. Bloom's book:

570
01:00:14,990 --> 01:00:17,993
Shakespeare:
The Invention of the Human.

571
01:00:17,993 --> 01:00:21,997
We were told there's a case of
plagiarism on your school record.

572
01:00:22,956 --> 01:00:26,877
You understand why we have to
take decisive action--

573
01:00:26,877 --> 01:00:29,296
You were told?

574
01:00:29,296 --> 01:00:32,466
-By who?
-That is hardly the issue here.

575
01:00:32,466 --> 01:00:36,470
This sort of cheating
has to have real consequences.

576
01:00:36,470 --> 01:00:40,474
We've spoken to your guardians.

577
01:00:40,474 --> 01:00:42,142
Of course you have.

578
01:00:42,142 --> 01:00:46,146
Frankly, we're not sure whether
you can continue at this school.

579
01:00:59,201 --> 01:01:01,203
Well?

580
01:01:01,203 --> 01:01:05,207
Why don't you ask Terry?

581
01:01:05,666 --> 01:01:09,670
Or maybe it's time you took
some responsibility.

582
01:01:11,505 --> 01:01:15,509
Maybe it's time.

583
01:01:57,134 --> 01:02:00,554
This is Jack Avery.
I'm out of the country...

584
01:02:00,554 --> 01:02:04,558
...but I'm checking my messages.

585
01:03:27,599 --> 01:03:31,520
Wake up.

586
01:03:33,522 --> 01:03:36,483
Don't make a sound.
Get dressed. We're gonna go.

587
01:03:36,483 --> 01:03:40,487
-Where? With who?
-Away with me.

588
01:03:40,487 --> 01:03:44,491
-Quit it! You're looking!
-Like there's something to see.

589
01:03:45,909 --> 01:03:49,288
It's raining. I was sleeping.
I don't wanna go.

590
01:03:49,288 --> 01:03:53,292
It'll be really fun.

591
01:03:53,959 --> 01:03:57,838
They're giving away
Dragon Ball Z at Blockbuster.

592
01:03:57,838 --> 01:04:01,842
We can go and avoid the rush.

593
01:04:01,967 --> 01:04:05,971
Really?

594
01:04:17,149 --> 01:04:21,153
Close the door.

595
01:04:28,994 --> 01:04:32,122
What if they find out?

596
01:04:32,122 --> 01:04:36,126
I'll take the blame.
Get in the car.

597
01:04:50,474 --> 01:04:54,478
You don't know what you're doing.

598
01:05:11,453 --> 01:05:13,163
Wanna slow down a little?

599
01:05:13,163 --> 01:05:17,167
One thing I learned from Terry:
Buckle up.

600
01:05:36,645 --> 01:05:40,649
-Terry's gonna kill you!
-Maybe so.

601
01:05:48,240 --> 01:05:51,952
Turn that off.

602
01:05:51,952 --> 01:05:55,956
Turn that shit off!

603
01:05:58,584 --> 01:06:02,588
Look out!

604
01:06:06,300 --> 01:06:10,012
You almost creamed that guy!

605
01:06:10,012 --> 01:06:14,016
Right. Turn it off!

606
01:06:26,236 --> 01:06:28,822
-I wanna go back.
-We're not.

607
01:06:28,822 --> 01:06:32,117
-What do you mean?
-Figure it out.

608
01:06:32,117 --> 01:06:36,038
We have to! You tricked me
and now I'm in trouble.

609
01:06:36,246 --> 01:06:39,041
-The Glasses tricked you.
-What?

610
01:06:39,041 --> 01:06:43,045
Did not. They're sleeping.

611
01:06:57,601 --> 01:07:01,605
They were gonna send me away
and you'd stay home with them.

612
01:07:02,731 --> 01:07:05,484
I like Terry. I like Erin.

613
01:07:05,484 --> 01:07:09,279
You like the shit they buy you.
You couldn't see it.

614
01:07:09,279 --> 01:07:11,657
They made you lie
to that social worker.

615
01:07:11,657 --> 01:07:14,868
I didn't know she was
a social worker.

616
01:07:14,868 --> 01:07:18,872
You didn't wanna lose
your Nintendo.

617
01:07:20,040 --> 01:07:23,210
They bought you off.

618
01:07:23,210 --> 01:07:27,172
-Where are you taking us?
-The point was to get away.

619
01:07:32,219 --> 01:07:36,181
Crap.

620
01:07:46,692 --> 01:07:50,654
Don't say anything stupid.

621
01:07:52,698 --> 01:07:54,783
The highway is closed.

622
01:07:54,783 --> 01:07:58,787
There's a mudslide.
You need to use Malibu Canyon....

623
01:08:03,208 --> 01:08:06,795
-Can I see your driver's license?
-My license?

624
01:08:06,795 --> 01:08:10,799
-And your registration too.
-It's....

625
01:08:11,842 --> 01:08:15,846
It's over there in all my stuff.

626
01:08:17,723 --> 01:08:21,727
I think I saw it over here.

627
01:08:23,687 --> 01:08:27,691
Pull onto the shoulder and step out.

628
01:08:33,322 --> 01:08:37,326
Officer!

629
01:08:37,951 --> 01:08:40,412
These are my kids.

630
01:08:40,412 --> 01:08:42,289
Terry Glass, Glass Transit.

631
01:08:42,289 --> 01:08:46,293
-We loaned you limos for the parade.
-How are you?

632
01:08:48,587 --> 01:08:50,589
Rhett, poor baby! Come with me.

633
01:08:50,589 --> 01:08:53,759
We have a behavior problem
back at home.

634
01:08:53,759 --> 01:08:57,763
Your sister's going through
a hard time right now.

635
01:08:57,888 --> 01:09:01,892
-You know, teenage-girl stuff.
-Got you.

636
01:09:02,351 --> 01:09:06,355
Good luck.

637
01:09:13,487 --> 01:09:17,491
Move over.

638
01:09:17,574 --> 01:09:21,578
-You can turn around here.
-Thanks.

639
01:09:38,220 --> 01:09:42,224
Don't you have anything to say to me?

640
01:09:43,934 --> 01:09:47,271
You killed my parents.

641
01:09:47,271 --> 01:09:50,232
That's insane and hurtful.

642
01:09:50,232 --> 01:09:54,236
You're threatened by your
business associates. I saw it.

643
01:09:55,404 --> 01:09:58,824
Like Erin said to me,
"We need your trust."

644
01:09:58,824 --> 01:10:01,702
You need my trust,
$4 million worth.

645
01:10:01,702 --> 01:10:05,539
I got a business.
My wife's a successful doctor.

646
01:10:05,539 --> 01:10:09,501
-I got a big, new--
-"Piggy bank."

647
01:10:11,545 --> 01:10:14,798
That's just words out of context.

648
01:10:14,798 --> 01:10:18,802
-What about the BMW my dad drove?
-What about it?!

649
01:10:21,305 --> 01:10:25,309
For their anniversary,
I lent them a Beemer...

650
01:10:25,309 --> 01:10:28,312
...so Dave wouldn't drive her
in that Saab...

651
01:10:28,312 --> 01:10:30,856
...which I repainted.

652
01:10:30,856 --> 01:10:32,983
No good deed goes unpunished.

653
01:10:32,983 --> 01:10:36,987
In your trashy mind,
you twisted that into--

654
01:10:36,987 --> 01:10:40,991
What do you think? Cut the steering,
stripped the brakes?

655
01:10:41,867 --> 01:10:43,035
Yeah.

656
01:10:43,035 --> 01:10:46,747
It's understandable,
basic psychology.

657
01:10:46,747 --> 01:10:49,458
You don't wanna blame your dad.

658
01:10:49,458 --> 01:10:52,294
That he had too much booze
that night.

659
01:10:52,294 --> 01:10:55,005
Then you'd
ask why your mom and dad...

660
01:10:55,005 --> 01:10:59,009
...hit the bottle.
Whose behavior drove them to drink?

661
01:11:18,904 --> 01:11:21,907
Get this straight.

662
01:11:21,907 --> 01:11:25,869
You and Rhett are mine.

663
01:11:38,340 --> 01:11:42,344
I suggest you forget your lurid,
adolescent fantasies and start--

664
01:11:48,517 --> 01:11:51,353
Help!

665
01:11:51,353 --> 01:11:55,357
-Let me go, bastard!
-Calm down, little girl!

666
01:12:01,530 --> 01:12:03,949
What's happening out there?

667
01:12:03,949 --> 01:12:06,410
Your sister is having a tantrum.

668
01:12:06,410 --> 01:12:10,372
Come on. Come back to bed.

669
01:12:11,415 --> 01:12:15,377
Let me go! Get off!

670
01:12:15,669 --> 01:12:19,590
Let go!

671
01:12:20,132 --> 01:12:24,136
You...!

672
01:12:28,557 --> 01:12:30,726
Listen hard, Ruby.

673
01:12:30,726 --> 01:12:33,854
Anything happens to you,
we got Rhett...

674
01:12:33,854 --> 01:12:36,982
...and all we need is one child.

675
01:12:36,982 --> 01:12:40,944
Erin! Stop him, please!

676
01:12:41,570 --> 01:12:45,574
Erin!

677
01:12:45,991 --> 01:12:49,953
Please come help me, please!
He's not gonna hurt you!

678
01:12:51,121 --> 01:12:55,125
Erin, please don't! Erin, don't! No!

679
01:13:01,882 --> 01:13:05,761
Thank you for listening.

680
01:13:05,761 --> 01:13:09,765
You'll feel better now, Ruby.
Rest, relax.

681
01:13:29,201 --> 01:13:31,495
-Where to, ladies?
-The mall.

682
01:13:31,495 --> 01:13:34,039
Time-out.
Has anyone heard from Ruby?

683
01:13:34,039 --> 01:13:37,960
-Me? Not for a month.
-Same. Won't even answer my e-mails.

684
01:13:38,669 --> 01:13:42,631
What up with Little Miss Malibu?
Too busy bodysurfing?

685
01:13:43,465 --> 01:13:47,469
Then we are too busy for her.

686
01:13:54,977 --> 01:13:58,981
-Hello?
-Where's the rest of our money?

687
01:13:59,523 --> 01:14:03,068
The bank sent me a check
with the wrong zip code.

688
01:14:03,068 --> 01:14:06,989
Some incompetent jerk at the bank
inverted the last digits!

689
01:14:07,906 --> 01:14:11,827
So I'll need another--

690
01:14:17,082 --> 01:14:20,961
We gotta expand the house,
a wing for the kids.

691
01:14:20,961 --> 01:14:24,965
Our little boy gets bigger every day,
and the girl is a teen.

692
01:14:26,258 --> 01:14:30,220
I don't know if you have kids....

693
01:14:30,929 --> 01:14:34,850
Anyway, construction costs
in Malibu are off the charts.

694
01:14:36,143 --> 01:14:39,730
I'm estimating a quarter million.

695
01:14:39,730 --> 01:14:43,692
We'll need to see blueprints.
There's an approval process.

696
01:14:44,693 --> 01:14:47,821
You can't get them
without an architect.

697
01:14:47,821 --> 01:14:51,742
Mine wants a cash down payment.
He's in demand.

698
01:14:52,284 --> 01:14:56,246
I believe we advanced you...

699
01:14:56,830 --> 01:15:00,834
...$30,000 for that purpose
just last month.

700
01:15:00,834 --> 01:15:04,755
But that was for a room,
before I realized I needed a wing.

701
01:15:05,547 --> 01:15:09,551
Isn't a guardian supposed to
keep the kids comfortable?

702
01:15:11,553 --> 01:15:13,180
Here's the trust.

703
01:15:13,180 --> 01:15:17,184
It authorizes me to use money
to enlarge the house.

704
01:15:17,643 --> 01:15:21,647
And guardians aren't supposed
to suffer economically...

705
01:15:21,939 --> 01:15:25,901
...in fulfilling their obligations?
I'm paying two tuitions.

706
01:15:26,777 --> 01:15:30,739
I employ a nanny. The kids see
therapists to deal with the tragedy.

707
01:15:32,032 --> 01:15:35,285
I plan trips to broaden
their horizons...

708
01:15:35,285 --> 01:15:39,289
... and it's like a root canal
when I need reimbursement.

709
01:15:46,338 --> 01:15:50,342
-Where'd you get it?
-You faxed it to us last week.

710
01:15:50,634 --> 01:15:54,638
I'm surprised to hear you have
both children at Westcott.

711
01:15:58,058 --> 01:16:02,062
Did I say Westcott? We changed our
minds about it. It's too glitzy.

712
01:16:04,648 --> 01:16:08,652
-We gotta do what's best for them.
-Isn't that the truth?

713
01:16:10,195 --> 01:16:13,699
Thank you for waiting.
I'll take your order.

714
01:16:13,699 --> 01:16:17,369
I need five dozen
10cc syringes fentanyl...

715
01:16:17,369 --> 01:16:21,081
...and I need two dozen
20cc syringes Demerol.

716
01:16:21,081 --> 01:16:24,209
We sent up 60 of fentanyl on Monday.

717
01:16:24,209 --> 01:16:28,130
I doubled the PCA infusion
rate of Demerol in six patients.

718
01:16:28,797 --> 01:16:30,841
Dr. Glass?

719
01:16:30,841 --> 01:16:33,260
I'm on the phone with the pharmacy.

720
01:16:33,260 --> 01:16:36,930
Dr. Wise wants to see you.

721
01:16:36,930 --> 01:16:40,851
The Medical Director.

722
01:16:58,869 --> 01:17:01,747
Wake up, Ruby.

723
01:17:01,747 --> 01:17:05,751
Sleeping Beauty.

724
01:17:13,258 --> 01:17:17,179
All you do is sleep. It scares me.

725
01:17:21,141 --> 01:17:25,145
So you're losing your medical license.
That's wonderful.

726
01:17:26,897 --> 01:17:30,901
-I have a sickness.
-Yeah, it's called self-pity.

727
01:17:32,069 --> 01:17:36,031
Complicated by being born
without a freaking backbone.

728
01:17:36,323 --> 01:17:39,284
So I'm weak, am I?

729
01:17:39,284 --> 01:17:41,787
Maybe I am.

730
01:17:41,787 --> 01:17:44,957
At least I'm not greedy
and reckless...

731
01:17:44,957 --> 01:17:47,876
...borrowing a million
from loan sharks--

732
01:17:47,876 --> 01:17:51,880
Which should've been paid off!
We had a good thing going...

733
01:17:52,381 --> 01:17:54,800
...till you put your hand in.

734
01:17:54,800 --> 01:17:57,970
A good thing? You son of a bitch!

735
01:17:57,970 --> 01:18:01,974
-I was a doctor!
-Yeah, but you became a junkie.

736
01:18:02,099 --> 01:18:06,061
Not until you did what you did.

737
01:18:06,478 --> 01:18:10,399
Where were you when I did it?

738
01:18:12,526 --> 01:18:16,488
Right. I saw an opportunity, Erin.

739
01:18:17,823 --> 01:18:20,951
I saw an opportunity and grabbed it.

740
01:18:20,951 --> 01:18:24,955
I had what you didn't.
I had the nerve, the will.

741
01:18:25,414 --> 01:18:28,959
Since nobody gave me
a chance, I took it.

742
01:18:28,959 --> 01:18:32,963
I'm not doing this anymore.

743
01:18:34,381 --> 01:18:36,967
It's already done.

744
01:18:36,967 --> 01:18:40,971
This is about containing the damage.
Understand?

745
01:18:43,098 --> 01:18:46,560
Good.

746
01:18:46,560 --> 01:18:50,147
You know we have to
get rid of the girl.

747
01:18:50,147 --> 01:18:53,233
Speaking of which, we're dry?

748
01:18:53,233 --> 01:18:57,154
There's nothing to take care of her,
so I'll get something.

749
01:19:00,240 --> 01:19:04,244
If I can't find drugs in L.A....

750
01:19:38,612 --> 01:19:41,073
Hi!

751
01:19:41,073 --> 01:19:44,910
Wave at the camera, Ruby.
Wave at the camera!

752
01:19:44,910 --> 01:19:47,579
They can't catch me!

753
01:19:47,579 --> 01:19:51,500
-Come in the water, Erin!
-Wait! I'm coming too!

754
01:20:00,217 --> 01:20:04,221
Spin me, Erin! Faster!
-Good girl.

755
01:21:03,155 --> 01:21:07,117
Rhett. Rhett, move away.

756
01:21:29,014 --> 01:21:32,184
Erin! It took some doing...

757
01:21:32,184 --> 01:21:36,146
...but I found some
pharmaceutical morphine.

758
01:21:38,148 --> 01:21:42,152
Erin?

759
01:22:03,048 --> 01:22:06,969
God, not now.

760
01:22:07,344 --> 01:22:10,180
Erin?

761
01:22:10,180 --> 01:22:14,184
Erin?

762
01:22:15,352 --> 01:22:19,356
1875 Montego Canyon.

763
01:22:19,398 --> 01:22:23,360
I thought you'd wanna know.

764
01:22:29,241 --> 01:22:33,203
Ruby?

765
01:22:34,621 --> 01:22:38,542
Honey?

766
01:22:43,255 --> 01:22:47,217
Terry needs to talk to you kids.

767
01:24:23,105 --> 01:24:26,775
You kids are a handful,
you know that?

768
01:24:26,775 --> 01:24:30,779
Where's your sister?
Where's your damn sister?

769
01:24:44,668 --> 01:24:48,672
I should've put you here from day one.

770
01:25:55,280 --> 01:25:59,284
What's happening?

771
01:26:06,208 --> 01:26:10,212
He got the Jag.

772
01:26:23,600 --> 01:26:27,604
-He walked back in the house.
-Keep working.

773
01:26:57,509 --> 01:27:01,513
He's sleeping.

774
01:27:05,517 --> 01:27:09,521
He fell asleep.
There's gonna be a change of plans.

775
01:28:13,502 --> 01:28:16,380
Why would he do that?

776
01:28:16,380 --> 01:28:17,923
He's bombed!

777
01:28:17,923 --> 01:28:21,927
He finished a bottle of vodka.
It's right there.

778
01:28:25,055 --> 01:28:29,059
I see what's weird.

779
01:28:46,785 --> 01:28:48,662
Begleiter! What's going on?

780
01:28:48,662 --> 01:28:52,666
You ought to have your
wife take a look at that.

781
01:28:53,083 --> 01:28:57,129
-She's not home.
-Your office said you were home.

782
01:28:57,796 --> 01:29:01,800
I kept calling but nobody answered,
so here I am.

783
01:29:02,843 --> 01:29:06,847
The bank blocked your
guardianship account.

784
01:29:06,972 --> 01:29:10,726
The officer believes
there's malfeasance.

785
01:29:10,726 --> 01:29:12,686
The sons of bitches!

786
01:29:12,686 --> 01:29:15,022
I went out on a limb for you.

787
01:29:15,022 --> 01:29:18,567
I warned you about the girl's claims...

788
01:29:18,567 --> 01:29:22,571
...about her accusations, because I
trusted you, as did the Bakers.

789
01:29:23,155 --> 01:29:26,742
But if you've lied,
the courts will step in.

790
01:29:26,742 --> 01:29:30,746
If they take these children,
they have no place to go.

791
01:29:33,040 --> 01:29:37,044
He thought he was helping us.

792
01:29:50,182 --> 01:29:54,186
Mr. Glass, where are the children?

793
01:29:55,020 --> 01:29:58,774
At their music lessons.
Their piano lessons.

794
01:29:58,774 --> 01:30:01,860
Next, I'll have to buy
them a Steinway...

795
01:30:01,860 --> 01:30:05,781
...and the bank will say,
"Can't they play the kazoo?"

796
01:30:12,079 --> 01:30:16,083
Shit!

797
01:30:16,959 --> 01:30:18,502
That's my Testarossa.

798
01:30:18,502 --> 01:30:22,506
No, that's our Testarossa.
Until we get our money back.

799
01:30:22,673 --> 01:30:25,217
You planned to skip town today?

800
01:30:25,217 --> 01:30:27,886
Where'd you get that idea?

801
01:30:27,886 --> 01:30:31,807
-Your wife called us this morning.
-My wife?

802
01:30:34,059 --> 01:30:38,063
Before you leave, how about repaying
the loan in one lump cash sum?

803
01:30:39,940 --> 01:30:42,067
He doesn't have our money.

804
01:30:42,067 --> 01:30:45,112
-What's going on, Terry?
-Ask him.

805
01:30:45,112 --> 01:30:49,116
-Your partner?
-Bastard robbed me blind.

806
01:30:50,075 --> 01:30:54,079
-Oh, my God. I'm leaving.
-No, no, no.

807
01:30:54,538 --> 01:30:56,081
-You're not.
-Really?

808
01:30:56,081 --> 01:30:59,126
-We need an explanation.
-From me?

809
01:30:59,126 --> 01:31:03,130
I have nothing to do with this!

810
01:31:17,728 --> 01:31:21,273
-Nobody listens anymore.
-Are you happy, Terry?

811
01:31:21,273 --> 01:31:25,277
Feel good about that?
Terry, you're a troublemaker.

812
01:31:25,986 --> 01:31:29,990
-That took care of the problem.
-No. We'll discuss this in the car.

813
01:31:31,033 --> 01:31:34,286
There's nothing to discuss!

814
01:31:34,286 --> 01:31:37,581
Just walk like a man out to the Jag.

815
01:31:37,581 --> 01:31:40,834
That was the problem. You solved it.

816
01:31:40,834 --> 01:31:44,755
The rest is pure profit.

817
01:31:44,755 --> 01:31:48,175
Not the Jag. The Volvo.

818
01:31:48,175 --> 01:31:52,179
Wait here for a minute, okay?

819
01:31:55,599 --> 01:31:59,603
-Nice little drive in our car.
-No! Not in there!

820
01:31:59,770 --> 01:32:03,190
Not in there! No! Not in there!

821
01:32:03,190 --> 01:32:05,317
I don't even have the key!

822
01:32:05,317 --> 01:32:08,153
We got all the keys to all the cars.

823
01:32:08,153 --> 01:32:10,614
Take the Volvo, not the Jag!

824
01:32:10,614 --> 01:32:14,034
-Let's go!
-Okay, you win!

825
01:32:14,034 --> 01:32:16,328
-You win.
-It's over.

826
01:32:16,328 --> 01:32:19,331
Just please take the Volvo, okay?

827
01:32:19,331 --> 01:32:21,750
You're making this difficult.

828
01:32:21,750 --> 01:32:23,961
-Whatever.
-Take the Volvo.

829
01:32:23,961 --> 01:32:27,965
Brand loyalty. I like that.

830
01:32:37,808 --> 01:32:39,643
That little bitch!

831
01:32:39,643 --> 01:32:43,230
You're some kind of joker.
We'll take the Jaguar.

832
01:32:43,230 --> 01:32:47,234
No!

833
01:33:43,415 --> 01:33:47,127
You haven't been
to our Tarzana office.

834
01:33:47,127 --> 01:33:50,005
We got a handball court and a sauna...

835
01:33:50,005 --> 01:33:54,009
...and way in the back we have
this special room.

836
01:33:55,052 --> 01:33:59,014
Totally soundproof.

837
01:34:11,443 --> 01:34:15,364
What the--?

838
01:34:22,079 --> 01:34:26,041
What the--?

839
01:35:11,545 --> 01:35:15,549
What'd you do to this car?!
What'd you do to this car?!

840
01:36:03,889 --> 01:36:07,893
Hi, you guys need some help?

841
01:36:08,185 --> 01:36:12,189
Yes.

842
01:36:37,339 --> 01:36:41,343
-Everything under control?
-We got it covered.

843
01:37:00,237 --> 01:37:04,241
Terry.

844
01:37:05,951 --> 01:37:09,955
You two kids stay in the car.

845
01:37:09,955 --> 01:37:13,917
I have a possible T.C.
Southbound, Malibu Canyon.

846
01:37:13,917 --> 01:37:17,921
-I'll be investigating.
-Copy that.

847
01:38:02,716 --> 01:38:04,468
I have a rollover T.C...

848
01:38:04,468 --> 01:38:08,472
...with one fatality.
I'll need two backup units.

849
01:38:14,019 --> 01:38:17,940
Ruby.

850
01:38:28,325 --> 01:38:30,202
It's okay.

851
01:38:30,202 --> 01:38:34,206
Ruby, go! Drive!

852
01:38:35,749 --> 01:38:39,753
-Where's the stupid key?!
-It's okay!

853
01:38:40,045 --> 01:38:44,049
We're gonna die here! Let's go!
Come on, find them!

854
01:38:45,217 --> 01:38:48,095
Ruby!

855
01:38:48,095 --> 01:38:50,472
I need your help.

856
01:38:50,472 --> 01:38:52,474
-He's getting closer!
-I got them!

857
01:38:52,474 --> 01:38:56,478
He's getting closer!

858
01:38:56,687 --> 01:39:00,649
Drive! Drive! Drive!

859
01:39:04,069 --> 01:39:07,990
Why are you stopping?!

860
01:39:10,367 --> 01:39:12,119
It's okay, honey.

861
01:39:12,119 --> 01:39:16,123
-Buckle up.
-What're you doing?!

862
01:39:16,999 --> 01:39:21,003
-All's forgiven.
-What're you doing?

863
01:40:04,171 --> 01:40:08,175
You kids okay?
Go back and wait by my car.

864
01:40:52,594 --> 01:40:56,598
Things will get easier from here on.

865
01:40:57,266 --> 01:41:01,186
They already have.

866
01:41:01,186 --> 01:41:05,190
Let's go home.
