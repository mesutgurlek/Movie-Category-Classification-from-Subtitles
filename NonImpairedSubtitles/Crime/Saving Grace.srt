00:00:34,948 --> 00:00:38,748
Alouette,
getile Alouette, 
2
00:00:38,785 --> 00:00:41,845
 Alouette,
je te plumerai 
3
00:00:41,888 --> 00:00:43,822
 Je te plumerai le chien 
4
00:00:43,857 --> 00:00:45,654
...woof, woof! 
5
00:00:47,227 --> 00:00:49,252
 Working out, work, work 
6
00:00:49,296 --> 00:00:51,821
 Work cochon. work work! 
7
00:00:51,865 --> 00:00:53,332
 Oh hh ! 
8
00:00:53,367 --> 00:00:56,564
 Alouette, getile Alouette 
9
00:01:05,312 --> 00:01:09,214
 Alouette, je te plumerai 
10
00:03:04,631 --> 00:03:08,499
 All things bright
and beautiful 
11
00:03:08,535 --> 00:03:12,528
 All creatures
great and small 
12
00:03:12,572 --> 00:03:16,668
 All things
wise and wonderful 
13
00:03:16,710 --> 00:03:20,771
 the Lord God made them all 
14
00:03:32,492 --> 00:03:34,585
Grant us. Lord.
15
00:03:34,628 --> 00:03:37,620
the wisdom and the grace
to use aright the time
16
00:03:37,664 --> 00:03:40,292
that is left to us
here on earth.
17
00:03:40,333 --> 00:03:43,325
Lead us to repent
of our sins.
18
00:03:43,370 --> 00:03:47,636
the evil we have done,
and the good we have not done,
19
00:03:47,674 --> 00:03:51,405
and strengthen us to follow
the steps of your son
20
00:03:51,444 --> 00:03:55,778
in the way that leads
to the fullness of eternal life
21
00:03:55,815 --> 00:03:58,181
through Jesus Christ
our Lord.
22
00:03:58,218 --> 00:03:59,708
Amen.
23
00:03:59,753 --> 00:04:01,050
Amen.
24
00:04:21,007 --> 00:04:22,941
Bastard.
25
00:04:24,110 --> 00:04:26,704
Still owes me
for a lobster.
26
00:04:33,853 --> 00:04:35,980
It's like
that David Bowie film.
27
00:04:36,022 --> 00:04:37,284
“The Man Who Fell to Earth.“
28
00:04:37,324 --> 00:04:38,689
No, it's not.
29
00:04:38,725 --> 00:04:41,421
Trevethan jumped out of a plane
without a parachute.
30
00:04:41,461 --> 00:04:43,053
In the film. David Bowie
was an alien.
31
00:04:43,096 --> 00:04:44,654
Is an alien.
32
00:04:44,698 --> 00:04:46,689
Oh, don't start
with that bollocks.
33
00:04:46,733 --> 00:04:48,792
There are many people
in showbiz
34
00:04:48,835 --> 00:04:50,268
who are from off world.
35
00:04:50,303 --> 00:04:53,101
Have you ever looked
into David Bowie's eyes?
36
00:04:53,139 --> 00:04:54,731
Well,
by that same token,
37
00:04:54,774 --> 00:04:56,639
you could say that Charlie
was an alien.
38
00:04:56,676 --> 00:04:58,109
Exactly.
39
00:04:59,446 --> 00:05:02,313
Charlie, more wine?
Thanks, Grace.
40
00:05:03,350 --> 00:05:06,148
House looks lovely.
Oh, thank you.
41
00:05:06,186 --> 00:05:07,153
Morris?
42
00:05:07,187 --> 00:05:08,449
Yes, thank you.
43
00:05:09,923 --> 00:05:11,652
Thank you, Grace, yes.
44
00:05:11,691 --> 00:05:13,124
Thank you, Grace.
45
00:05:16,796 --> 00:05:17,990
Tongue.
46
00:05:18,031 --> 00:05:19,589
There's sausage rolls
in the kitchen.
47
00:05:19,633 --> 00:05:21,362
Thank you.
Wash your hands.
48
00:05:21,401 --> 00:05:22,595
Okay.
49
00:05:24,304 --> 00:05:25,965
Grace, who you
looking for?
50
00:05:26,006 --> 00:05:29,669
Um oh, Matthew,
there you are.
51
00:05:29,709 --> 00:05:32,200
Would you check
the humidifier in the greenhouse?
52
00:05:32,245 --> 00:05:34,304
I completely forgot.
53
00:05:34,347 --> 00:05:38,306
It's done. I did it yesterday
when you asked me.
54
00:05:38,351 --> 00:05:40,410
Don't know what
I'd do without him.
55
00:05:44,524 --> 00:05:46,924
What kind of injuries
would someone have
56
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:48,552
if they fell
from that height?
57
00:05:48,595 --> 00:05:50,495
Very bad ones.
58
00:05:50,530 --> 00:05:52,293
Why did he do it?
59
00:05:52,332 --> 00:05:54,095
We don't really know.
60
00:05:54,134 --> 00:05:56,625
Perhaps he thought he was
going to the bathroom,
61
00:05:56,670 --> 00:05:58,865
and he picked
the wrong door?
62
00:05:58,905 --> 00:06:02,363
Yes, very likely.
Would you excuse me?
63
00:06:04,110 --> 00:06:06,704
I'm gonna get you!
No, you're not.
64
00:06:08,081 --> 00:06:11,414
Matt...
have you got any?
65
00:06:11,451 --> 00:06:13,180
No.
There's none about.
66
00:06:13,219 --> 00:06:14,777
Matthew... ?
67
00:06:15,588 --> 00:06:17,783
All right, come on.
Thank you.
68
00:06:24,597 --> 00:06:26,929
She's not here,
Grace.
69
00:06:26,966 --> 00:06:28,490
Who's not here?
70
00:06:28,535 --> 00:06:31,265
She left just after
the service.
71
00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:34,870
Did you talk to her?
72
00:06:34,908 --> 00:06:36,102
No.
73
00:06:44,050 --> 00:06:47,247
Do you think
she'll leave?
74
00:06:47,287 --> 00:06:48,948
She loves it here.
75
00:06:48,988 --> 00:06:51,980
Diana seems to think it was
some sort of accident,
76
00:06:52,025 --> 00:06:54,755
that he was just looking
for the lavatory.
77
00:06:54,794 --> 00:06:57,627
I imagine he went
on the way down.
78
00:06:58,598 --> 00:07:00,759
This the last of it?
79
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:01,960
Enjoy.
80
00:07:02,001 --> 00:07:04,561
It's gonna be a long.
cold winter.
81
00:07:04,604 --> 00:07:05,468
All right,
Alfred?
82
00:07:05,505 --> 00:07:07,564
Ah, hello,
Dr. Bamford.
83
00:07:07,607 --> 00:07:08,631
Hi, Matthew.
84
00:07:08,675 --> 00:07:11,940
I wonder if you could
do me a favor, Doctor?
85
00:07:11,978 --> 00:07:13,707
My ear needs to be
looked at again.
86
00:07:13,747 --> 00:07:17,615
It's still...
still giving a chirp.
87
00:07:17,650 --> 00:07:20,084
Is it all right I p
into the surgery tomorrow?
88
00:07:21,121 --> 00:07:22,145
Okay.
89
00:07:22,188 --> 00:07:23,951
Well, I 'd better
be off.
90
00:07:23,990 --> 00:07:27,790
There's reports of salmon
poachers out on the estuary.
91
00:07:31,931 --> 00:07:33,956
You all right?
92
00:07:35,902 --> 00:07:37,665
You have no idea.
93
00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:49,876
My mum wanted to get one
of those dishwashers.
94
00:07:49,916 --> 00:07:52,578
My dad said, “No,
she's already got one.”
95
00:07:52,619 --> 00:07:53,643
Him.
96
00:07:59,392 --> 00:08:02,293
If there's anything I can do,
Grace around the house.
97
00:08:02,328 --> 00:08:05,195
Yes, well, everyone's
been very kind, but...
98
00:08:05,231 --> 00:08:08,894
but really... I'm fine.
99
00:08:08,935 --> 00:08:10,596
Here, look, I'll do that
No, it's
100
00:08:11,638 --> 00:08:12,969
Harvey!
101
00:08:13,006 --> 00:08:15,600
I'm fine.
102
00:08:15,642 --> 00:08:17,109
Right O
103
00:09:08,328 --> 00:09:10,296
Good morning,
Matthew.
104
00:09:10,330 --> 00:09:11,524
Hiya.
105
00:09:15,168 --> 00:09:17,363
Hello, Joyce.
Good morning, Grace.
106
00:09:24,544 --> 00:09:27,104
Good morning. Tom.
Hello, Grace.
107
00:09:32,185 --> 00:09:33,880
Hello, ladies.
108
00:09:40,593 --> 00:09:42,823
Morning, Grace.
109
00:09:42,862 --> 00:09:45,990
I'd like a packet
of paracetamol,
110
00:09:46,032 --> 00:09:47,897
and I'd like to settle
my account.
111
00:09:47,934 --> 00:09:51,893
Oh, no.
We've... lost our accounts.
112
00:09:51,938 --> 00:09:52,962
Why don't you pay us
next month?
113
00:09:53,006 --> 00:09:54,371
Lost the accounts?
114
00:09:54,407 --> 00:09:57,103
It's very mysterious.
115
00:09:58,144 --> 00:10:00,772
Well. I'll just take
the paracetamol.
116
00:10:00,813 --> 00:10:01,973
Here's some.
117
00:10:02,015 --> 00:10:03,778
How much is that?
118
00:10:03,816 --> 00:10:07,377
Oh, five pence.
119
00:10:09,589 --> 00:10:10,988
Special offer.
120
00:10:14,260 --> 00:10:15,852
Thank you.
121
00:10:17,030 --> 00:10:19,555
Right.
Thank you.
122
00:10:19,599 --> 00:10:21,760
Bye bye now.
Bye bye.
123
00:10:55,568 --> 00:10:58,935
I can extend
the overdraft a bit.
124
00:10:58,972 --> 00:11:00,872
And maybe you can
find out if there's
125
00:11:00,907 --> 00:11:02,875
a life insurance policy?
126
00:11:02,909 --> 00:11:04,308
Investments?
127
00:11:04,344 --> 00:11:07,336
I don't understand.
This must be a mistake.
128
00:11:07,380 --> 00:11:10,076
Your late husband
used the house
129
00:11:10,116 --> 00:11:13,142
as an asset
to raise capital.
130
00:11:13,186 --> 00:11:16,246
As you have no children,
you'll inherit the estate,
131
00:11:16,289 --> 00:11:19,315
but you'll also inherit
the mortgage.
132
00:11:19,359 --> 00:11:21,350
Well, that's fine.
The house is 300 years old.
133
00:11:21,394 --> 00:11:23,453
The mortgage must be
paid off by now.
134
00:11:23,496 --> 00:11:25,191
You don't
understand.
135
00:11:25,231 --> 00:11:28,029
He used the house
as collateral
136
00:11:28,067 --> 00:11:31,059
for loans to finance
business deals,
137
00:11:31,104 --> 00:11:34,471
none of which
actually took off.
138
00:11:34,507 --> 00:11:36,634
Well, what about
the money he left me?
139
00:11:36,676 --> 00:11:38,735
There isn't any.
140
00:11:38,778 --> 00:11:42,407
And... then there are
the mortgage payments.
141
00:11:42,448 --> 00:11:44,211
How much are they?
142
00:11:44,250 --> 00:11:46,445
L2.000 a month.
143
00:12:21,788 --> 00:12:24,586
“I'll be up
your flue in a minute or two,
144
00:12:24,624 --> 00:12:27,218
'cause I know where
to find it. “
145
00:12:29,295 --> 00:12:31,286
Hey, how are
you doing?
146
00:12:32,131 --> 00:12:33,359
Matthew...
147
00:12:33,399 --> 00:12:35,196
I've got some bad news.
I'm afraid.
148
00:12:35,234 --> 00:12:36,667
I know.
149
00:12:44,043 --> 00:12:47,308
Have you tried plant food?
Tried everything.
150
00:12:47,346 --> 00:12:49,712
They're dying on purpose.
I even talk to them.
151
00:12:49,749 --> 00:12:51,717
What do you say?
“Would you mind not dying?”
152
00:12:51,751 --> 00:12:53,742
You really are
a crap gardener, Matthew.
153
00:12:53,786 --> 00:12:56,448
What do I know about plants?
I'm from Glasgow.
154
00:12:56,489 --> 00:12:58,480
I hate this.
I really hate this.
155
00:12:58,524 --> 00:12:59,855
Well. somebody
else do it.
156
00:12:59,892 --> 00:13:01,120
We're sea pele.
157
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:03,424
He's not.
He's a doctor.
158
00:13:03,463 --> 00:13:05,192
I don't have
a fabulous track record
159
00:13:05,231 --> 00:13:06,960
when it comes
to keeping things alive.
160
00:13:06,999 --> 00:13:08,523
It's like the signs.
161
00:13:08,568 --> 00:13:10,502
What signs?
162
00:13:10,536 --> 00:13:12,970
“Armageddon
163
00:13:13,005 --> 00:13:15,405
Final conflict.“
164
00:13:15,441 --> 00:13:16,931
A man falls from the sky,
165
00:13:16,976 --> 00:13:19,945
You lose your job,
and all the plants are dying.
166
00:13:21,914 --> 00:13:24,542
I meant to do that.
167
00:13:25,718 --> 00:13:29,085
Do you have
a stock portfollo, perhaps?
168
00:13:29,122 --> 00:13:32,285
What's that?
I don't know.
169
00:13:32,325 --> 00:13:34,589
I just thought
you might have one.
170
00:13:34,627 --> 00:13:36,822
Well. No, there's
nothing like that.
171
00:13:36,863 --> 00:13:40,026
It's just bills
and letters of credit.
172
00:13:40,066 --> 00:13:43,467
I don't understand this.
There are accounts here
173
00:13:43,503 --> 00:13:45,971
for companies I've never
even heard of.
174
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:49,840
We've got a Swiss
bank account.
175
00:13:49,876 --> 00:13:52,811
There's nothing in it,
but we do have one.
176
00:13:52,845 --> 00:13:54,073
Hmm...
177
00:13:54,113 --> 00:13:56,274
I'm sure
there's something...
178
00:13:56,315 --> 00:13:58,875
tucked away... somewhere.
179
00:13:58,918 --> 00:14:00,818
Yeah. well. that's
what I thought, Gerald.
180
00:14:00,853 --> 00:14:05,586
but, no.
There's not.
181
00:14:05,625 --> 00:14:07,149
There's nothing.
182
00:14:09,395 --> 00:14:11,886
What in God's name
am I going to do?
183
00:14:39,825 --> 00:14:42,259
You all right?
You look peaked.
184
00:14:42,295 --> 00:14:45,355
Fine. I'm...
just a bit hung over.
185
00:14:45,398 --> 00:14:47,696
Did we drink that much?
I can't remember.
186
00:14:47,733 --> 00:14:49,963
Uhh...
187
00:14:50,002 --> 00:14:52,800
God. you're really ill.
You never get hangovers.
188
00:14:52,838 --> 00:14:54,829
I'll be fine
once I get on the boat.
189
00:14:54,874 --> 00:14:56,398
I don't think you
should go to work.
190
00:14:56,442 --> 00:14:58,433
I think you should
see the doctor.
191
00:15:00,213 --> 00:15:03,341
I can't see anyone
without an appointment.
192
00:15:04,383 --> 00:15:06,977
Tea?
Yes. please.
193
00:15:08,187 --> 00:15:12,123
Hey, what are you doing?
Get off of there!
194
00:15:12,158 --> 00:15:13,716
Given your recent troubles.
195
00:15:13,759 --> 00:15:15,954
we rather thought
you'd want to cancel.
196
00:15:15,995 --> 00:15:18,225
It's only a tea party.
We could have it anywhere.
197
00:15:18,264 --> 00:15:20,858
But we always
have it here.
198
00:15:20,900 --> 00:15:22,663
It's tradition.
199
00:15:22,702 --> 00:15:25,000
I 've been working
on a new hybrid
200
00:15:25,037 --> 00:15:29,201
Phalansis pathedilum.
It's beautiful.
201
00:15:29,242 --> 00:15:31,938
All right, ladies.
back to business.
202
00:15:31,978 --> 00:15:34,606
Do we invite Dr. Bamford.
203
00:15:34,647 --> 00:15:37,377
given his disgraceful
display last year?
204
00:15:38,751 --> 00:15:40,241
No!
205
00:15:40,286 --> 00:15:41,753
Come on. sir,
off the mower!
206
00:15:41,787 --> 00:15:43,652
What's going on?
207
00:15:43,689 --> 00:15:47,523
Afternoon. Mrs. Trevethan.
Hello, Bob, Terry.
208
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:48,652
How's your mum's hip?
209
00:15:48,694 --> 00:15:50,719
Oh. much better,
thanks.
210
00:15:50,763 --> 00:15:52,924
They want to take
the lawn mower.
211
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:57,233
Well. it's not us.
It's the finance company.
212
00:15:57,270 --> 00:15:59,329
There haven't been
any payments.
213
00:16:01,674 --> 00:16:04,006
Well. you better
take it, then.
214
00:16:12,184 --> 00:16:14,311
I'm really sorry.
215
00:16:33,572 --> 00:16:36,200
Matthew.
216
00:16:36,242 --> 00:16:37,834
Matthew, you don't
have to do this.
217
00:16:37,877 --> 00:16:39,344
It's allright.
218
00:16:39,378 --> 00:16:41,642
You've paid me
to the end of the week.
219
00:16:41,681 --> 00:16:45,014
I don't believe he even lied
about the lawn mower.
220
00:16:46,786 --> 00:16:49,186
He lied
about everything.
221
00:16:59,131 --> 00:17:01,292
Couldn't you
get a job?
222
00:17:02,335 --> 00:17:03,893
What could I do?
223
00:17:03,936 --> 00:17:05,335
Well.
you could...
224
00:17:07,006 --> 00:17:08,496
You want a cup of tea
or something?
225
00:17:08,541 --> 00:17:10,475
No, thank you.
226
00:17:10,509 --> 00:17:14,946
Matthew... I'm really
sorry about your job.
227
00:17:14,980 --> 00:17:17,073
Oh. that's
all right.
228
00:17:17,116 --> 00:17:19,550
You're gonna have
to get a goat.
229
00:17:20,686 --> 00:17:22,586
lf there's anything
else I can do?
230
00:17:22,621 --> 00:17:24,612
Actually, I was hing
you would say that.
231
00:17:24,657 --> 00:17:25,988
Why?
232
00:17:26,025 --> 00:17:30,359
Grace, you are the best
gardener in the world.
233
00:17:30,396 --> 00:17:32,921
I've got some plants
that are really sick.
234
00:17:32,965 --> 00:17:37,231
They desperately need help.
Well. where are they?
235
00:17:39,739 --> 00:17:40,831
What?
236
00:17:47,713 --> 00:17:49,704
Ah hhgh !
237
00:18:00,426 --> 00:18:01,859
Shh.
238
00:18:04,330 --> 00:18:05,820
Why are you
whispering?
239
00:18:05,865 --> 00:18:08,129
I don't want to wake up
any squirrels. Just through here.
240
00:18:08,167 --> 00:18:09,964
In here.
241
00:18:10,002 --> 00:18:11,560
Are these
Gerald's plants?
242
00:18:11,604 --> 00:18:14,198
No, no.
They're mine.
243
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:16,333
I think I may have
overwatered them.
244
00:18:19,779 --> 00:18:22,441
I'm not stupid.
Matthew.
245
00:18:22,481 --> 00:18:25,382
I know what this is.
246
00:18:25,418 --> 00:18:27,045
What is it?
247
00:18:27,086 --> 00:18:28,747
Hemp.
248
00:18:28,788 --> 00:18:30,050
Is it?
249
00:18:31,190 --> 00:18:32,248
Aye, it's hemp.
250
00:18:32,291 --> 00:18:34,225
Well. they're not
getting enough light.
251
00:18:34,260 --> 00:18:36,160
They're never going
to grow in the dark.
252
00:18:36,195 --> 00:18:38,095
I didn't really want
anybody to see them.
253
00:18:38,130 --> 00:18:39,688
Well. you wouldn't,
would you?
254
00:18:39,732 --> 00:18:41,563
No.
255
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:43,261
Now, if you want
these poor things to grow,
256
00:18:43,302 --> 00:18:45,668
they need some decent soil
and some better light,
257
00:18:45,704 --> 00:18:47,672
Okay, thanks.
258
00:18:53,112 --> 00:18:54,579
Come on. then...
259
00:18:54,613 --> 00:18:56,672
Let's take one back
to the greenhouse,
260
00:18:56,715 --> 00:18:57,647
see what we can do.
261
00:18:57,683 --> 00:18:59,947
You may not
want to do that.
262
00:18:59,985 --> 00:19:03,477
I'm a gardener.
These are sick plants.
263
00:19:03,522 --> 00:19:05,854
All right.
264
00:19:15,034 --> 00:19:17,366
Come on !
Quick, quick!
265
00:19:17,403 --> 00:19:19,428
Where have you been?
266
00:19:19,472 --> 00:19:22,566
It's brilliant, Nicky.
I've saved the plants.
267
00:19:22,608 --> 00:19:24,303
How?
I called in an expert.
268
00:19:24,343 --> 00:19:25,332
Who?
269
00:19:25,377 --> 00:19:28,073
The best gardener
in the world.
270
00:19:28,113 --> 00:19:29,102
Grace.
271
00:19:29,148 --> 00:19:30,172
Grace?
272
00:19:30,216 --> 00:19:31,774
Yeah. It's fantastic.
She's doing it
273
00:19:31,817 --> 00:19:33,614
as compensation for
having to lay me off.
274
00:19:33,652 --> 00:19:36,382
Isn't that nice?
I don't know.
275
00:19:36,422 --> 00:19:37,946
What do you mean.
you don't know?
276
00:19:37,990 --> 00:19:41,721
Hasn't she got enough problems
without getting into drugs?
277
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:43,284
What are you talking
about, “drugs”?
278
00:19:43,329 --> 00:19:45,456
Matthew, you know
what I'm talking about.
279
00:19:45,498 --> 00:19:47,363
It's still illegal.
280
00:19:47,399 --> 00:19:50,664
She's very vulnerable
just now.
281
00:19:50,703 --> 00:19:53,137
He you're not
taking advantage of her.
282
00:19:53,172 --> 00:19:55,538
I'm doing this for us!
283
00:19:55,574 --> 00:19:57,872
Is this your way
of saying thanks?
284
00:19:57,910 --> 00:19:59,400
No.
285
00:19:59,445 --> 00:20:01,936
I've got
a much better way.
286
00:20:03,249 --> 00:20:05,740
Congratulations.
Mr. Stewart.
287
00:20:05,784 --> 00:20:10,414
You are tonight's
lucky Scotsman.
288
00:20:35,548 --> 00:20:37,516
Well. I either am
or I'm not.
289
00:20:37,550 --> 00:20:41,748
No, no, you definitely
are pregnant indeed.
290
00:20:41,787 --> 00:20:43,812
Is that a good thing?
291
00:20:43,856 --> 00:20:46,450
Yes.
292
00:20:46,492 --> 00:20:48,619
Yeah.
it's brilllant.
293
00:20:48,661 --> 00:20:51,630
Any idea
who the father is?
294
00:20:51,664 --> 00:20:53,996
I think Iknow.
I looked at the test slldes.
295
00:20:54,033 --> 00:20:56,126
Some of the chromosomes
had littlekilts on them.
296
00:20:57,169 --> 00:20:58,693
Very funny.
297
00:20:58,737 --> 00:21:01,297
I do have
some bad news. though.
298
00:21:01,340 --> 00:21:03,103
What?
299
00:21:03,142 --> 00:21:05,667
There's a slight risk
of ginger hair.
300
00:21:07,179 --> 00:21:09,170
Piss off.
301
00:21:09,214 --> 00:21:10,738
How are
all our plants doing?
302
00:21:10,783 --> 00:21:12,250
Oh. um...
303
00:21:12,284 --> 00:21:14,718
He's called in
an expert.
304
00:21:14,753 --> 00:21:17,916
Oh. Sounds good.
305
00:21:17,957 --> 00:21:20,551
Look, don't mention
the baby yet, okay?
306
00:21:20,593 --> 00:21:22,185
I just want
to tell him
307
00:21:22,227 --> 00:21:23,785
when the time
is right.
308
00:21:23,829 --> 00:21:25,990
What baby?
309
00:21:26,031 --> 00:21:27,555
Have a sweetie.
310
00:21:32,137 --> 00:21:33,968
Will she live,
Doctor?
311
00:21:34,006 --> 00:21:35,598
I think so.
312
00:21:36,642 --> 00:21:38,610
Where did these seeds
come from?
313
00:21:38,644 --> 00:21:40,009
Guy in a pub
in Bodmin.
314
00:21:40,045 --> 00:21:40,943
No.
315
00:21:40,980 --> 00:21:42,811
I mean.
what kind are they?
316
00:21:42,848 --> 00:21:45,715
Oh. They're indica
sativa hybrids.
317
00:21:45,751 --> 00:21:48,982
Purple haze with early pearl
crossed with ruderalls.
318
00:21:49,021 --> 00:21:50,955
Yes. well. anyway,
they're designed to grow
319
00:21:50,990 --> 00:21:53,117
in a very sunny climate.
320
00:21:53,158 --> 00:21:54,420
If you say so.
321
00:21:54,460 --> 00:21:57,554
Is it the bud
the bit you're after?
322
00:21:57,596 --> 00:21:59,188
Yeah.
323
00:22:01,667 --> 00:22:02,634
Look.
324
00:22:07,106 --> 00:22:08,630
What is it?
325
00:22:08,674 --> 00:22:11,199
That's the start
of a new bud.
326
00:22:12,811 --> 00:22:15,109
You did that
in 24 hours?
327
00:22:15,147 --> 00:22:18,708
You're a witch.
Oh. it's not me, really.
328
00:22:18,751 --> 00:22:20,912
It's just a question
of having enough light.
329
00:22:20,953 --> 00:22:23,683
No light, no buds.
Simple.
330
00:22:26,725 --> 00:22:27,817
Yes?
331
00:22:27,860 --> 00:22:29,953
Hello. Is it all right
if I park there?
332
00:22:29,995 --> 00:22:31,360
Yes.
Dogs?
333
00:22:31,397 --> 00:22:32,989
Dogs?
334
00:22:33,032 --> 00:22:34,795
Dogs.
Do you have dogs?
335
00:22:34,833 --> 00:22:37,859
Postmen and surveyors.
irresistible to our canine friends.
336
00:22:37,903 --> 00:22:39,336
No, there's no dogs.
Good o.
337
00:22:39,371 --> 00:22:41,839
Oh. yes. yes. yes.
Fabulous home.
338
00:22:41,874 --> 00:22:43,205
Can I help you?
339
00:22:43,242 --> 00:22:47,372
No, no. I'm fine on me own.
Tea's always nice.
340
00:22:47,413 --> 00:22:48,744
I'm sorry, I don'tknow
why you're here.
341
00:22:48,781 --> 00:22:49,941
I think you've come
to the wrong house.
342
00:22:49,982 --> 00:22:53,008
Oh. I'm sorry.
NigeI Plimpton.
343
00:22:53,052 --> 00:22:55,612
Trevethan?
Liac house?
344
00:22:55,654 --> 00:22:58,885
Evaluation for Ramptons
Re debts Outstanding?
345
00:22:58,924 --> 00:23:02,382
It's standard procedure before
a house is put up for auction.
346
00:23:02,428 --> 00:23:04,020
But the house
isn't up for auction.
347
00:23:04,063 --> 00:23:05,030
Ah...
348
00:23:05,064 --> 00:23:08,295
Well. I'm afraid
it will  be.
349
00:23:08,333 --> 00:23:10,995
U h. here, look.
350
00:23:11,036 --> 00:23:12,936
Pele in... your position
351
00:23:12,971 --> 00:23:14,962
often st ening
their mail.
352
00:23:15,007 --> 00:23:18,602
so I'm the first real proof
it's all happening.
353
00:23:19,645 --> 00:23:21,442
I think I'd like you
to leave, please.
354
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:24,506
Well. I'm sorry.
I can't.
355
00:23:24,550 --> 00:23:26,108
I really must
do this.
356
00:23:26,151 --> 00:23:28,847
I'd like you
to leave as well.
357
00:23:31,657 --> 00:23:33,955
Call the office
to reschedule.
358
00:23:40,032 --> 00:23:41,795
Thank you.
359
00:23:43,802 --> 00:23:46,930
Ramptons is an enormous
investment trust.
360
00:23:46,972 --> 00:23:49,805
John's syndicate
took a huge tumble.
361
00:23:49,842 --> 00:23:51,036
I had no idea
362
00:23:51,076 --> 00:23:52,976
he had business interests
in the city.
363
00:23:53,011 --> 00:23:55,002
Yes. but how much
do I owe them?
364
00:23:55,047 --> 00:23:57,106
If you don't pay
the money owing.
365
00:23:57,149 --> 00:23:59,743
they can claim
any or all
366
00:23:59,785 --> 00:24:02,049
of your assets.
367
00:24:02,087 --> 00:24:04,385
And this. of course,
would include
368
00:24:04,423 --> 00:24:06,254
the house.
369
00:24:06,291 --> 00:24:09,658
How much
do I owe them. Melvyn?
370
00:24:09,695 --> 00:24:12,027
£300.000.
371
00:24:13,132 --> 00:24:14,656
Approximately.
372
00:24:56,108 --> 00:24:58,167
Bastard.
373
00:25:49,661 --> 00:25:51,128
Matthew?
374
00:25:51,163 --> 00:25:52,130
Yeah?
375
00:25:52,164 --> 00:25:56,328
You know that plant
I'm looking after for you?
376
00:25:56,368 --> 00:25:58,063
U h huh.
377
00:25:58,103 --> 00:25:59,331
How much
is it worth?
378
00:25:59,371 --> 00:26:01,601
Oh. it hasn't died.
has it?
379
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:03,505
No, no, no.
It's thriving.
380
00:26:03,542 --> 00:26:05,237
I just, um...
381
00:26:05,277 --> 00:26:07,711
wondered how much
you'd get for it.
382
00:26:07,746 --> 00:26:09,737
Ounce for ounce,
383
00:26:09,781 --> 00:26:12,147
the really good stuff's
worth more than gold.
384
00:26:15,087 --> 00:26:17,214
Greenhouse.
Now!
385
00:26:17,256 --> 00:26:18,223
Okay.
386
00:26:19,558 --> 00:26:21,492
Here's what I think.
387
00:26:21,526 --> 00:26:23,460
We take cuttings
from the mother plant,
388
00:26:23,495 --> 00:26:25,656
root the cuttings and grow them
under lights. hydronically,
389
00:26:25,697 --> 00:26:27,255
go straight to budding.
390
00:26:27,299 --> 00:26:29,062
We could have the first
harvest in a matter of weeks.
391
00:26:29,101 --> 00:26:31,592
I could clear what you need
in the first run. probably more.
392
00:26:31,637 --> 00:26:33,229
Could do it
in the time you've got.
393
00:26:33,272 --> 00:26:36,105
You haven't given it
any thought, then?
394
00:26:37,576 --> 00:26:39,237
You can't tell anybody.
395
00:26:39,278 --> 00:26:43,772
All things bright
and beautiful
396
00:26:43,815 --> 00:26:48,616
All creatures
great and small...
397
00:26:50,489 --> 00:26:52,047
It's just started.
398
00:26:52,090 --> 00:26:53,614
We've got at least
an hour.
399
00:26:53,659 --> 00:26:57,891
...the Lord God
made them all...
400
00:27:01,967 --> 00:27:03,457
Sorry.
401
00:27:27,626 --> 00:27:30,060
Oh. do be reasonable.
402
00:27:30,095 --> 00:27:32,655
That piece
is worth that alone.
403
00:27:32,698 --> 00:27:34,529
I'm being very fair,
Mrs. T.
404
00:27:34,566 --> 00:27:36,090
Very good price
I'm giving you.
405
00:27:36,134 --> 00:27:38,193
Well.
it's daylight robbery.
406
00:27:38,236 --> 00:27:40,670
What else have you got?
407
00:27:40,706 --> 00:27:43,004
 Come up and see me 
408
00:27:43,041 --> 00:27:47,774
 make me smile 
409
00:27:47,813 --> 00:27:49,713
 I'll do what you want 
410
00:27:49,748 --> 00:27:54,412
 running wild... 
411
00:27:55,854 --> 00:27:58,152
 There's nothing left 
412
00:27:58,190 --> 00:28:02,718
 all gone and run away 
413
00:28:02,761 --> 00:28:05,195
 Maybe you'll tarry 
414
00:28:05,230 --> 00:28:07,221
 for a while... 
415
00:28:07,265 --> 00:28:08,960
Is it this
blue one, Jack?
416
00:28:09,001 --> 00:28:10,127
That's right.
417
00:28:10,168 --> 00:28:12,102
 It's just a test 
418
00:28:12,137 --> 00:28:14,571
 a game for us to play... 
419
00:28:14,606 --> 00:28:16,801
Hi. Grace.
420
00:28:16,842 --> 00:28:18,673
Hello, Nicky.
421
00:28:18,710 --> 00:28:20,234
I haven't seen you
for days.
422
00:28:20,278 --> 00:28:24,112
You okay?
Yes. Busy.
423
00:28:24,149 --> 00:28:25,741
What are you doing?
424
00:28:25,784 --> 00:28:29,845
Building a fence,
keep out the rabbits.
425
00:28:29,888 --> 00:28:31,947
With electrical wire?
426
00:28:31,990 --> 00:28:33,685
It's electric fence.
427
00:28:33,725 --> 00:28:37,320
Okay. Is Matt
up at the house?
428
00:28:37,362 --> 00:28:39,227
It's just I've got to
see him about something.
429
00:28:39,264 --> 00:28:40,959
No, he's out.
He's...
430
00:28:40,999 --> 00:28:42,967
looking for a transformer...
431
00:28:43,001 --> 00:28:45,367
for the electric fence.
432
00:28:45,404 --> 00:28:47,998
If you do see him.
will you tell him
433
00:28:48,040 --> 00:28:49,871
that I'll meet him
in the pub at 7:00?
434
00:28:49,908 --> 00:28:51,170
Yeah. righty o.
435
00:28:52,778 --> 00:28:53,745
Bye bye.
436
00:28:53,779 --> 00:28:54,905
Bye.
437
00:29:05,390 --> 00:29:06,823
Good book, is it?
438
00:29:08,794 --> 00:29:13,288
Oh. Jackie Colllns.
439
00:29:13,331 --> 00:29:15,799
I'm reading a kafka
at the moment.
440
00:29:15,834 --> 00:29:18,132
Not very funny.
441
00:29:18,170 --> 00:29:19,660
Except the one
about that bloke
442
00:29:19,704 --> 00:29:23,196
that turns into a beetle.
That's a bit wacky.
443
00:29:23,241 --> 00:29:25,505
Wouldn't get anybody
turning into a beetle
444
00:29:25,544 --> 00:29:27,569
in a Jackie Colllns.
445
00:29:27,612 --> 00:29:30,274
Might get someone
sleeping with a beetle.
446
00:29:32,317 --> 00:29:33,944
He wrapped her up
447
00:29:33,985 --> 00:29:37,148
in his stick like arms.
all six of them.
448
00:29:37,189 --> 00:29:41,148
tapping her sensuously
on the head
449
00:29:41,193 --> 00:29:43,491
with his wiggly woggly
aerials. “
450
00:29:45,831 --> 00:29:47,059
That's it.
451
00:29:47,099 --> 00:29:50,398
lf he comes in now,
tell him I left in a huff.
452
00:29:50,435 --> 00:29:51,459
All right, love.
453
00:29:51,503 --> 00:29:52,527
' N ight.
454
00:29:52,571 --> 00:29:54,596
Probably lying on your couch
at home asleep.
455
00:29:54,639 --> 00:29:55,867
Yeah.
you're right.
456
00:30:01,113 --> 00:30:02,808
Sorry.
457
00:30:08,019 --> 00:30:10,920
It gives me
great pleasure
458
00:30:10,956 --> 00:30:14,255
to ask “ Dame Reggae Spllff”
of Port Llac
459
00:30:14,292 --> 00:30:17,284
to switch on this year's
illumination.
460
00:30:17,329 --> 00:30:19,627
Thank you.
thank you. thank you.
461
00:30:26,271 --> 00:30:29,263
 When I die
and they lay me to rest 
462
00:30:29,307 --> 00:30:33,209
 gonna go to the place
that's the best 
463
00:30:34,246 --> 00:30:36,646
 When they
lay me down to die 
464
00:30:36,681 --> 00:30:41,118
 Goin' up to the spirit
in the sky 
465
00:30:41,153 --> 00:30:44,122
 Goin' up to the spirit
in the sky 
466
00:30:44,156 --> 00:30:45,054
 Spirit in the sky... 
467
00:30:45,090 --> 00:30:47,115
 That's where I'm gonna go
when I die 
468
00:30:47,159 --> 00:30:48,319
Where are you?
469
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:49,622
Here we are.
Good thing.
470
00:30:49,661 --> 00:30:51,026
Keep your eyes
shut.
471
00:30:52,264 --> 00:30:56,325
...gonna go to the place
that's the best 
472
00:31:05,977 --> 00:31:08,605
It were up at the 'ouse.
I swear it.
473
00:31:18,924 --> 00:31:20,653
I told you.
474
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:23,757
That's a lot
of llght.
475
00:31:23,795 --> 00:31:25,092
Let's call
the pollce.
476
00:31:25,130 --> 00:31:27,030
And the R.A. F.
They'll wanna be included.
477
00:31:27,065 --> 00:31:28,032
Let's not.
478
00:31:28,066 --> 00:31:30,091
Let's just go
back into the pub.
479
00:31:30,135 --> 00:31:31,500
There's something I want
to discuss with you two.
480
00:31:31,536 --> 00:31:33,094
Are you out
of your fucking mind?
481
00:31:33,138 --> 00:31:34,696
We've gotta get
to the house, to save Grace!
482
00:31:34,739 --> 00:31:36,866
Yeah. Iknow what's
causing the llghts.
483
00:31:36,908 --> 00:31:38,808
J ust come back
into the pub.
484
00:31:40,979 --> 00:31:42,412
I s it gonna blow?
485
00:31:42,447 --> 00:31:43,937
No, I don't think so.
486
00:31:43,982 --> 00:31:45,176
That's it.
487
00:31:48,753 --> 00:31:50,550
Well. how do youknow?
488
00:31:50,589 --> 00:31:51,988
I 've seen it before
in Amsterdam.
489
00:31:52,023 --> 00:31:53,957
years ago when I was
on a medicaI study
490
00:31:53,992 --> 00:31:55,687
studying
something medical.
491
00:31:55,727 --> 00:31:57,388
So that's
their plan. then?
492
00:31:57,429 --> 00:31:58,828
Well. from what Matt's
been saying.
493
00:31:58,863 --> 00:32:01,331
and putting two and two
together, I reckon so, yeah.
494
00:32:01,366 --> 00:32:04,233
Kind of warms the heart,
Grace carrying on the locaI tradition
495
00:32:04,269 --> 00:32:06,294
of complete and utter
contempt for the law.
496
00:32:06,338 --> 00:32:07,930
Makes you proud.
497
00:32:07,973 --> 00:32:09,736
Did you try
that stuff, Doctor?
498
00:32:09,774 --> 00:32:13,437
Once at university.
Didn't inhale.
499
00:32:13,478 --> 00:32:15,309
Evening.
500
00:32:15,347 --> 00:32:17,338
Evening.
501
00:32:17,382 --> 00:32:19,509
Drinking after hours.
Charlle?
502
00:32:19,551 --> 00:32:21,109
Oh. private party,
Sergeant.
503
00:32:21,152 --> 00:32:23,848
Lagavulln?
16 year old.
504
00:32:23,888 --> 00:32:25,150
Just a small one.
505
00:32:25,190 --> 00:32:28,648
Any of you noticed those llghts
out towards Llac house?
506
00:32:28,693 --> 00:32:30,126
No.
507
00:32:30,161 --> 00:32:32,686
Any luck with
those poachers?
508
00:32:32,731 --> 00:32:34,961
Oh. I'll get them.
Just a matter of time.
509
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,968
Crime never pays.
510
00:32:37,002 --> 00:32:38,936
Certainly.
Yeah.
511
00:32:45,810 --> 00:32:47,573
Where have you been?
512
00:32:47,612 --> 00:32:48,636
Nowhere.
513
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:50,341
What you been up to?
Nothing.
514
00:32:50,382 --> 00:32:53,180
Well. I'm glad
we got that cleared up.
515
00:32:53,218 --> 00:32:55,880
I was working up at the house.
I lost track of time.
516
00:32:55,920 --> 00:32:57,387
I'm sorry.
517
00:32:57,422 --> 00:32:58,889
I waited for ages
in the pub.
518
00:32:58,923 --> 00:33:00,151
Didn't Grace tell you?
519
00:33:00,191 --> 00:33:01,920
She did.
I was really, really busy.
520
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:04,861
I'm really,
really sorry.
521
00:33:04,896 --> 00:33:06,420
Look, I 've got
something to tell you.
522
00:33:06,464 --> 00:33:08,625
I 've got something
to tell you too. Sit down.
523
00:33:08,667 --> 00:33:10,794
Let me tell you first.
Mine's really quite good.
524
00:33:10,835 --> 00:33:11,927
So's mine.
525
00:33:11,970 --> 00:33:14,598
All right,
you go first.
526
00:33:14,639 --> 00:33:16,573
No, you go first.
527
00:33:16,608 --> 00:33:17,575
All right.
528
00:33:17,609 --> 00:33:19,270
I'm moving the plants
up to Llac house.
529
00:33:19,311 --> 00:33:21,245
We're gonna grow them
up there really quickly.
530
00:33:21,279 --> 00:33:24,009
There's this speciaI way
of growing called hydronics.
531
00:33:24,049 --> 00:33:26,142
Youknow how Grace is
a really good gardener?
532
00:33:26,184 --> 00:33:27,811
It's gonna get us out
of all our money problems.
533
00:33:27,852 --> 00:33:29,319
“ U s”?
Well. me and Grace.
534
00:33:29,354 --> 00:33:31,447
It's simple, it's perfect.
We sell it!
535
00:33:31,489 --> 00:33:34,458
And anything we make over
what she needs. we splIt 50 50.
536
00:33:34,492 --> 00:33:36,187
Look, it's extreme,
but it's smart.
537
00:33:36,227 --> 00:33:38,161
I don't want to leave
here to get work,
538
00:33:38,196 --> 00:33:39,356
and this way,
I get to stay.
539
00:33:39,397 --> 00:33:41,797
U ntiI you go to jail.
I'm not going to jail.
540
00:33:41,833 --> 00:33:43,425
Matthew, smoking weed
is one thing.
541
00:33:43,468 --> 00:33:45,561
Large scale cuItivation
is another.
542
00:33:45,603 --> 00:33:48,003
I'm surprised at Grace.
It's really stupid.
543
00:33:48,039 --> 00:33:50,405
No, it's not really stupid.
It's really smart.
544
00:33:50,442 --> 00:33:52,273
I think it'd be different
if it was your idea.
545
00:33:52,310 --> 00:33:53,402
Yeah. you're right.
546
00:33:53,445 --> 00:33:54,935
When you're being chased
around your prison cell
547
00:33:54,979 --> 00:33:57,038
by a 1 6 stone bank robber
with a stiffy,
548
00:33:57,082 --> 00:33:59,277
I'll be here thinking.
“Why couldn't it have been me?
549
00:33:59,317 --> 00:34:01,717
Why couldn't I have had
that brilllant idea?”
550
00:34:01,753 --> 00:34:03,846
you've been bleating on
about how unhappy you are
551
00:34:03,888 --> 00:34:06,049
about losing your job,
and what's your solution?
552
00:34:06,091 --> 00:34:07,058
Crime.
553
00:34:07,092 --> 00:34:08,252
You get in deeper,
554
00:34:08,293 --> 00:34:10,158
and you drag Grace down
with you.
555
00:34:10,195 --> 00:34:13,323
Matthew, you are
such an idiot!
556
00:34:17,135 --> 00:34:18,864
What's your news. then?
557
00:34:20,271 --> 00:34:21,898
Doesn't matter.
558
00:34:53,204 --> 00:34:55,172
Hello?
Hello, Mrs. Trevethan?
559
00:34:55,206 --> 00:34:57,470
It's Quentin Rhodes here,
from Ramptons.
560
00:34:57,509 --> 00:34:59,409
It's about our surveyor.
He's rather upset.
561
00:34:59,444 --> 00:35:01,378
Velly solly.
562
00:35:01,413 --> 00:35:03,005
Long rumbah.
563
00:35:21,499 --> 00:35:25,162
Get both of those.
564
00:35:25,203 --> 00:35:27,501
So, she sort of goes
through there, you see?
565
00:35:30,141 --> 00:35:31,199
All right.
566
00:35:35,780 --> 00:35:38,010
Mrs. Trevethan.
567
00:35:38,049 --> 00:35:39,038
Hello.
568
00:35:39,083 --> 00:35:41,847
Have you met
my friend. Tony?
569
00:35:41,886 --> 00:35:43,183
Hello.
570
00:35:43,221 --> 00:35:45,655
My name is Tony.
I'm from Scandinavia.
571
00:35:45,690 --> 00:35:46,520
Oh...
572
00:35:46,558 --> 00:35:48,583
congratulations.
573
00:35:48,626 --> 00:35:50,719
Tony, could you go
and get one of those
574
00:35:50,762 --> 00:35:53,287
giant bags
ofkitty lItter?
575
00:35:56,367 --> 00:35:57,959
He doesn't taIk much.
576
00:35:58,002 --> 00:36:01,028
H mm. does he have to?
577
00:36:02,273 --> 00:36:03,740
Grace...
578
00:36:03,775 --> 00:36:05,936
have you read
any of my letters?
579
00:36:05,977 --> 00:36:07,877
I'm sorry, no...
580
00:36:07,912 --> 00:36:09,709
but I'm working
on a lIttle plan.
581
00:36:09,747 --> 00:36:12,045
I mean. it's a bit soon
to taIk about it just now,
582
00:36:12,083 --> 00:36:14,017
but see, I don't
want to jinx it.
583
00:36:14,052 --> 00:36:16,111
Grace, I can't do any more
to hold them off.
584
00:36:16,154 --> 00:36:18,714
It's gone up to head office,
and they don'tknow you.
585
00:36:18,756 --> 00:36:20,951
All they see is
a middle aged woman
586
00:36:20,992 --> 00:36:23,552
with huge debts
and no income.
587
00:36:23,595 --> 00:36:25,358
What are you
going to do?
588
00:36:25,396 --> 00:36:27,626
I'm becoming
a drugs dealer.
589
00:36:29,467 --> 00:36:31,128
Grace...
590
00:36:31,169 --> 00:36:33,660
I'm serious.
591
00:36:33,705 --> 00:36:35,070
Thank you.
Tony.
592
00:36:35,106 --> 00:36:36,334
You will phone me,
won't you?
593
00:36:36,374 --> 00:36:37,500
Yes. Righty o.
594
00:36:37,542 --> 00:36:38,509
Come on. Tony.
595
00:37:52,617 --> 00:37:55,677
Honey Chambers?
596
00:37:57,689 --> 00:37:59,816
44 Wilberforce Street,
597
00:37:59,857 --> 00:38:02,655
London. S.W. 3?
598
00:38:02,694 --> 00:38:05,162
He had me
post his letters.
599
00:38:07,465 --> 00:38:09,126
I never got any.
600
00:38:15,106 --> 00:38:17,438
Would you like
a drink?
601
00:38:22,447 --> 00:38:24,506
Do you have any children?
602
00:38:24,549 --> 00:38:27,848
No. I'm not very maternal.
I'm afraid.
603
00:38:27,885 --> 00:38:29,284
I couldn't have any.
604
00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:31,117
No. Iknow.
605
00:38:31,155 --> 00:38:33,646
Gosh.
youknow a lot.
606
00:38:36,194 --> 00:38:38,389
Can I ask you
another question?
607
00:38:40,164 --> 00:38:41,631
lf you want.
608
00:38:42,667 --> 00:38:44,430
How did you ce
with sex?
609
00:38:46,804 --> 00:38:48,101
Sex?
610
00:38:48,139 --> 00:38:49,106
Sex.
611
00:38:52,477 --> 00:38:54,502
What a nightmare.
612
00:39:00,118 --> 00:39:01,585
It was exhausting !
613
00:39:01,619 --> 00:39:05,111
Oh. God. it was
so frustrating !
614
00:39:05,156 --> 00:39:07,590
TaIk about flogging
a dead horse!
615
00:39:15,266 --> 00:39:17,325
No?
616
00:39:17,368 --> 00:39:19,268
Not really.
617
00:39:19,303 --> 00:39:21,294
What did you do, then?
618
00:39:22,306 --> 00:39:24,536
Well. I don't think we should
really be taIking about it.
619
00:39:24,575 --> 00:39:26,099
No, please.
I 'd like toknow.
620
00:39:29,547 --> 00:39:31,606
l...
621
00:39:33,918 --> 00:39:35,545
I ce cream.
622
00:39:36,587 --> 00:39:38,487
What? Pardon?
623
00:39:41,259 --> 00:39:42,317
I ce cream.
624
00:39:42,360 --> 00:39:44,225
I sucked it from
his fingertips.
625
00:39:44,262 --> 00:39:45,957
It drove him wild.
626
00:39:49,100 --> 00:39:52,160
I had to pretend to pass out
to get any rest at all.
627
00:39:52,203 --> 00:39:53,966
He was insatiable.
628
00:40:03,715 --> 00:40:06,047
I think he thought
you weren't interested.
629
00:40:07,118 --> 00:40:09,086
He was wrong.
630
00:40:14,225 --> 00:40:15,988
It's a beautiful
house.
631
00:40:16,027 --> 00:40:17,654
Yes.
632
00:40:17,695 --> 00:40:20,858
I think I 'd like you
to leave, now.
633
00:40:21,032 --> 00:40:23,159
He did love you.
634
00:40:23,201 --> 00:40:25,692
And don't
patronize me.
635
00:40:27,371 --> 00:40:30,101
Look, if you ever
want to taIk
636
00:40:30,141 --> 00:40:31,768
Yeah.
637
00:40:31,809 --> 00:40:33,367
Iknow the address.
638
00:40:57,401 --> 00:40:58,800
Matthew?
639
00:40:58,836 --> 00:40:59,825
Mm hmm?
640
00:41:03,107 --> 00:41:04,802
Will you give me one?
641
00:41:07,545 --> 00:41:08,910
What?
642
00:41:08,946 --> 00:41:11,540
I want toknow
what it feels like.
643
00:41:13,518 --> 00:41:15,213
Please?
644
00:41:16,254 --> 00:41:18,586
Grace, um...
645
00:41:18,623 --> 00:41:20,181
lf I'm growing it
and selllng it,
646
00:41:20,224 --> 00:41:22,192
I shouldknow
the effect it has.
647
00:41:22,226 --> 00:41:24,319
Oh. Yeah.
648
00:41:24,362 --> 00:41:27,490
Of course you should.
No, not here!
649
00:41:28,599 --> 00:41:30,499
Come on. let's get it
over and done with.
650
00:41:35,940 --> 00:41:39,637
Calm down.
There's no one about. Relax.
651
00:42:05,670 --> 00:42:07,399
I can't feel anything.
652
00:42:08,239 --> 00:42:10,764
Hey, hey, hey.
653
00:42:10,808 --> 00:42:11,797
Slow down.
654
00:42:18,616 --> 00:42:20,083
I s this addictive?
655
00:42:24,589 --> 00:42:26,113
It's not crack.
656
00:42:36,734 --> 00:42:38,497
Are you sure
this works?
657
00:42:38,536 --> 00:42:39,969
Oh. yes.
658
00:42:56,254 --> 00:42:57,221
What?
659
00:42:57,255 --> 00:42:58,745
Nothing.
660
00:42:58,789 --> 00:43:01,053
Yeah. What?
661
00:43:07,231 --> 00:43:08,755
What?
662
00:43:08,799 --> 00:43:10,232
Matthew, it's you.
663
00:43:10,268 --> 00:43:11,667
You're Scottish.
664
00:43:19,911 --> 00:43:22,209
Yeah? Thank you.
665
00:43:53,577 --> 00:43:55,807
God. I love it here.
666
00:43:55,846 --> 00:43:58,212
You feellng any better?
667
00:44:02,987 --> 00:44:06,582
Still feellng
a lIttle bit dizzy.
668
00:44:06,624 --> 00:44:08,922
You hungry?
669
00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:11,554
Oh. God. yes.
I hadn't thought of that.
670
00:44:12,663 --> 00:44:14,563
I'm ravenous !
671
00:44:17,034 --> 00:44:20,060
 Yes. I float so free... 
672
00:44:20,104 --> 00:44:23,301
 None too mystically 
673
00:44:23,341 --> 00:44:27,675
 You're a cat,
I'm a bird 
674
00:44:30,047 --> 00:44:33,744
 So catch me
while you can... 
675
00:44:33,784 --> 00:44:36,981
What made you
decide to do this?
676
00:44:37,021 --> 00:44:41,151
44 Wilberforce Street,
S.W. 3.
677
00:45:04,582 --> 00:45:06,914
Mrs. Trevethan. please
don't put the phone down
678
00:45:08,886 --> 00:45:11,218
... please don't put
the phone down.
679
00:45:11,255 --> 00:45:12,517
Problem?
680
00:45:12,556 --> 00:45:14,683
Thanks.kelly. I 've been
trying to get through
681
00:45:14,725 --> 00:45:17,888
to this Trevethan woman
for most of my llfe.
682
00:45:17,928 --> 00:45:20,260
Phone, letters...
683
00:45:20,297 --> 00:45:23,323
What is that woman
doing down there?
684
00:45:23,367 --> 00:45:26,359
I don'tknow what's wrong.
She's been really moody recently.
685
00:45:26,404 --> 00:45:28,429
Maybe she just
doesn't approve.
686
00:45:28,472 --> 00:45:30,497
Desperate times call
for desperate measures.
687
00:45:30,541 --> 00:45:33,135
The only other tion
was going back to Glasgow.
688
00:45:33,177 --> 00:45:36,044
She didn't want that, either.
Neither did l.
689
00:45:36,080 --> 00:45:38,105
My uncle Willle's got
a building site there.
690
00:45:38,149 --> 00:45:39,377
Yeah?
What's he build?
691
00:45:39,417 --> 00:45:40,406
U h. houses.
692
00:45:40,451 --> 00:45:42,510
Down there.
What? Okay.
693
00:45:49,060 --> 00:45:52,826
 I play a good game
but not as good as you 
694
00:45:52,863 --> 00:45:57,800
 I can be a lIttle cold.
but you can be so cruel... 
695
00:46:02,773 --> 00:46:04,673
Five... four...
696
00:46:04,708 --> 00:46:06,869
three...
two... one...
697
00:46:14,752 --> 00:46:17,744
 Now the damage is done 
698
00:46:17,788 --> 00:46:20,086
 Well. there's blood
in these veins 
699
00:46:20,124 --> 00:46:22,115
 and I cry when in pain 
700
00:46:22,159 --> 00:46:25,856
 I'm only human on the inside 
701
00:46:25,896 --> 00:46:28,330
 And if looks could deceive 
702
00:46:28,365 --> 00:46:30,333
 Make it hard to belleve 
703
00:46:30,367 --> 00:46:31,629
 I'm only human 
704
00:46:31,669 --> 00:46:35,696
 on the inside 
705
00:46:39,844 --> 00:46:41,675
 I thought you'd come through 
706
00:46:41,712 --> 00:46:43,703
 I thought you'd come clean 
707
00:46:43,747 --> 00:46:47,649
 You were the best thing
I should never have seen 
708
00:46:47,685 --> 00:46:49,949
 But you go to extremes 
709
00:46:49,987 --> 00:46:51,887
 You push me too far 
710
00:46:51,922 --> 00:46:56,086
 Then youkeep going
till you break my heart 
711
00:46:57,361 --> 00:47:00,660
 Yeah. you break my heart 
712
00:47:00,698 --> 00:47:02,632
 See, I bleed and I bruise 
713
00:47:02,666 --> 00:47:06,033
 Oh. but what's it to you?
I'm only human... 
714
00:47:06,070 --> 00:47:07,697
Ahoy!
715
00:47:07,738 --> 00:47:08,932
Hey.
716
00:47:11,775 --> 00:47:12,799
What do you want?
717
00:47:12,843 --> 00:47:14,242
I brought lunch.
718
00:47:14,278 --> 00:47:16,508
Cornish pasties.
I'mkidding.
719
00:47:25,022 --> 00:47:27,149
Fish.
You brought me fish?
720
00:47:27,191 --> 00:47:29,591
Well. I thought
it'd be a nice change.
721
00:47:31,395 --> 00:47:33,158
What are you
doing here?
722
00:47:33,197 --> 00:47:35,256
You never come
on the boat.
723
00:47:35,299 --> 00:47:37,631
I was beginning to wonder
what you looked like.
724
00:47:37,668 --> 00:47:39,499
I was always going to bed
when you get up.
725
00:47:39,537 --> 00:47:40,765
It's the tides.
726
00:47:40,804 --> 00:47:43,068
It's not the tides.
727
00:47:43,107 --> 00:47:44,699
I really don't like
what you're doing.
728
00:47:44,742 --> 00:47:45,766
Iknow.
729
00:47:45,809 --> 00:47:47,106
I don't want to be
in a relationship
730
00:47:47,144 --> 00:47:48,509
with someone
who's irresponsible.
731
00:47:48,546 --> 00:47:51,106
Yes. you do. I 've been
irresponsible my whole llfe.
732
00:47:51,148 --> 00:47:52,740
Well. it's time
you changed.
733
00:47:52,783 --> 00:47:53,909
Why?
734
00:47:53,951 --> 00:47:55,942
You're getting old.
735
00:47:55,986 --> 00:47:59,319
Fuck getting old !
These are laugh llnes !
736
00:47:59,356 --> 00:48:01,688
Nothing's that funny.
737
00:48:01,725 --> 00:48:04,853
I don't understand. I thought
you liked me the way I am.
738
00:48:04,895 --> 00:48:06,795
I do.
739
00:48:06,830 --> 00:48:09,856
But things change, and you have
to change with them.
740
00:48:09,900 --> 00:48:11,265
Fish and chips.
741
00:48:11,302 --> 00:48:13,099
Fantastic.
742
00:48:16,407 --> 00:48:18,307
Great.
Wait a few minutes...
743
00:48:18,342 --> 00:48:21,038
till “ Funboy” Buxton will
be here with more wacky fun
744
00:48:21,078 --> 00:48:23,342
with the afternoon crew,
but first, it's 1 2 : 00.
745
00:48:23,380 --> 00:48:25,575
time for the news headllnes.
746
00:48:25,616 --> 00:48:27,846
Pollce are celebrating
a major victory
747
00:48:27,885 --> 00:48:29,182
in the war on drugs today.
748
00:48:29,220 --> 00:48:31,051
Two men and one woman
749
00:48:31,088 --> 00:48:33,079
were found guiIty
at BristoI Crown Court
750
00:48:33,123 --> 00:48:35,284
after pollce
discovered marijuana
751
00:48:35,326 --> 00:48:38,227
with an estimated street value
of half a milllon pounds
752
00:48:38,262 --> 00:48:40,787
hidden in a barn
on their family farm.
753
00:48:40,831 --> 00:48:43,231
Sentencing them
to 1 5 year jaiI sentences.
754
00:48:43,267 --> 00:48:44,791
the judge
755
00:49:32,216 --> 00:49:34,047
Hello.
756
00:49:34,084 --> 00:49:36,177
Yeah.
757
00:49:36,220 --> 00:49:37,619
You all right?
758
00:49:37,655 --> 00:49:39,247
Fine.
759
00:49:39,290 --> 00:49:40,882
No, I just wondered.
youknow,
760
00:49:40,924 --> 00:49:42,824
when you didn't come
into the pub last night.
761
00:49:42,860 --> 00:49:44,760
I'm not drinking
at the moment.
762
00:49:48,866 --> 00:49:51,130
Are you angry with me?
763
00:49:51,168 --> 00:49:53,193
No.
I'm angry at Matthew.
764
00:49:53,237 --> 00:49:54,829
It's his fauIt.
765
00:49:54,872 --> 00:49:57,568
It was my decision
to do it.
766
00:49:57,608 --> 00:49:59,872
I'm trying to save
my house.
767
00:49:59,910 --> 00:50:01,935
Everybodyknows
what you're doing.
768
00:50:01,979 --> 00:50:04,072
Pretty soon you'll have
the pollce up there.
769
00:50:04,114 --> 00:50:05,911
They'll never
find out.
770
00:50:05,949 --> 00:50:08,179
Grace, your greenhouse
llghts up like a spaceship.
771
00:50:08,218 --> 00:50:09,845
Pele aren't stupid.
772
00:50:09,887 --> 00:50:13,414
We're nearly done now.
He could be in jaiI tomorrow.
773
00:50:19,330 --> 00:50:22,197
Why aren't you drinking?
774
00:50:22,232 --> 00:50:24,325
I just don't feel like it.
775
00:50:27,805 --> 00:50:30,239
He doesn'tknow,
does he?
776
00:50:37,648 --> 00:50:39,741
How can I help?
777
00:50:41,318 --> 00:50:43,343
Don't let him
go to jail.
778
00:50:53,764 --> 00:50:55,425
Our mutant buds
779
00:50:55,466 --> 00:50:57,593
will soon be ready,
Great One.
780
00:50:57,634 --> 00:51:00,660
We can release them
into the atmosphere
781
00:51:00,704 --> 00:51:03,400
and take over
the entire planet!
782
00:51:05,676 --> 00:51:07,303
Do you reallze
what we've done here?
783
00:51:07,344 --> 00:51:09,175
This is fabulous !
784
00:51:09,213 --> 00:51:11,443
It's time for me to go
to London. get a dealer.
785
00:51:11,482 --> 00:51:13,245
Oh. no you're not.
786
00:51:13,283 --> 00:51:15,046
You're staying here.
I'm going.
787
00:51:15,085 --> 00:51:16,074
What?
788
00:51:16,120 --> 00:51:18,213
That's my decision.
789
00:51:18,255 --> 00:51:19,916
Grace, I don't think
you reallze
790
00:51:19,957 --> 00:51:21,356
what you're
deallng with here.
791
00:51:21,392 --> 00:51:23,451
The last time you were
in London was five years ago
792
00:51:23,494 --> 00:51:25,394
for the Chelsea
flower show.
793
00:51:25,429 --> 00:51:27,522
You can't sell this stuff
through a florist.
794
00:51:27,564 --> 00:51:29,395
What's your master plan. then?
795
00:51:29,433 --> 00:51:32,527
Well. I was gonna go up
Portobello Road. or Notting H ill
796
00:51:32,569 --> 00:51:35,197
or something like that,
find a dealer, and sell it.
797
00:51:37,207 --> 00:51:38,731
Yeah.
Rubbish !
798
00:51:38,776 --> 00:51:40,539
It's better than what
you've got, which is nothing !
799
00:51:40,577 --> 00:51:42,477
You have to blend in.
Grace.
800
00:51:42,513 --> 00:51:44,208
A drug dealer
will take one look at you
801
00:51:44,248 --> 00:51:45,806
andknow there was
something fishy going on.
802
00:51:45,849 --> 00:51:48,682
With the greatest respect,
I'm the hip one.
803
00:51:48,719 --> 00:51:50,380
You're a wee bit more
“hip replacement. “
804
00:51:51,355 --> 00:51:52,754
One more word out of you.
805
00:51:52,790 --> 00:51:54,314
and I'm gonna throw
the whole lot into the sea.
806
00:51:54,358 --> 00:51:55,825
I don't think you're
thinking this through !
807
00:51:55,859 --> 00:51:57,724
I mean it.
You are not the boss of me!
808
00:51:57,761 --> 00:51:59,058
We're partners !
809
00:51:59,096 --> 00:52:01,360
The checks bounced.
remember?
810
00:52:02,533 --> 00:52:04,660
Women like cuddly toys.
don't they?
811
00:52:04,701 --> 00:52:06,328
They like to hug them
and squeeze them.
812
00:52:06,370 --> 00:52:07,598
and poke their eyes out,
813
00:52:07,638 --> 00:52:09,333
and rip their
fucking llmbs off.
814
00:52:12,743 --> 00:52:14,734
I avoid confrontation.
Iknow it.
815
00:52:14,778 --> 00:52:16,871
But if you grew up
in Glasgow in the 1 970s.
816
00:52:16,914 --> 00:52:19,280
you'd avoid it, too.
I want an easy llfe.
817
00:52:19,316 --> 00:52:20,874
I want to grow
some vegetables.
818
00:52:20,918 --> 00:52:23,113
smoke some reefer,
sing some carols at Christmas.
819
00:52:23,153 --> 00:52:25,246
and whoknows?
One day I 'd like to be a dad
820
00:52:25,289 --> 00:52:27,314
and raise a couple of calm
fucking children.
821
00:52:27,357 --> 00:52:29,325
but that's it.
I 've fucking had enough.
822
00:52:29,359 --> 00:52:31,350
I'm going.
No more “Mr. Cuddly toy. “
823
00:52:31,395 --> 00:52:34,125
I'm not hanging around to be
a whipping boy for “Ganja Grace”
824
00:52:34,164 --> 00:52:35,859
and “Captain N icky, “
the fucking lobster queen !
825
00:52:35,899 --> 00:52:37,366
I'm fuckin' gone,
I'm gone, I'm gone.
826
00:52:37,401 --> 00:52:39,460
I'm fucking out of here.
But see, before I go,
827
00:52:39,503 --> 00:52:40,800
I'm gonna see
both of these women
828
00:52:40,838 --> 00:52:44,296
and give them both
a piece of my mind.
829
00:52:44,341 --> 00:52:45,968
Are you done?
830
00:52:49,913 --> 00:52:51,608
Good shot.
831
00:54:22,506 --> 00:54:23,973
Moron !
832
00:54:38,388 --> 00:54:41,551
Can I show you
something privately?
833
00:54:41,592 --> 00:54:43,651
It's ever so nice.
834
00:54:43,694 --> 00:54:46,094
Come on.
let's go.
835
00:54:56,173 --> 00:54:58,232
I don'tknow who you are.
836
00:54:58,275 --> 00:55:00,800
I'm not interested.
837
00:55:01,745 --> 00:55:04,043
Come on.
838
00:55:04,081 --> 00:55:05,981
Come here.
839
00:55:06,016 --> 00:55:08,678
I 've got something
really tasty.
840
00:55:10,087 --> 00:55:11,850
Are you looking
for something?
841
00:55:11,888 --> 00:55:13,788
Know what I mean?
842
00:55:13,824 --> 00:55:15,519
All right, love.
H in.
843
00:55:16,560 --> 00:55:17,788
Hello.
844
00:55:17,828 --> 00:55:19,159
Excuse me?
Excuse me.
845
00:55:19,196 --> 00:55:21,721
Yo. Yo.
846
00:55:21,765 --> 00:55:23,289
Nah.
847
00:56:05,742 --> 00:56:07,369
I love it here.
848
00:56:07,411 --> 00:56:09,038
It's so quiet.
849
00:56:09,079 --> 00:56:13,675
lf you think this is quiet,
you should see Evensong.
850
00:56:14,718 --> 00:56:17,380
I wish I were
a Cathollc sometimes.
851
00:56:17,421 --> 00:56:19,616
I ncense,
nice costumes...
852
00:56:19,656 --> 00:56:22,386
A lot to be said
for it, really.
853
00:56:22,426 --> 00:56:25,190
They have confession. too.
854
00:56:35,706 --> 00:56:37,936
I 've got some friends...
855
00:56:37,974 --> 00:56:41,375
and I think they're going
to get into a lot of trouble,
856
00:56:41,411 --> 00:56:44,005
and I don'tknow
what to do.
857
00:56:44,047 --> 00:56:47,710
Don't suppose you
can go to the pollce?
858
00:56:47,751 --> 00:56:49,378
Thought not.
859
00:56:49,419 --> 00:56:52,718
lf you have
to commit a crime...
860
00:56:52,756 --> 00:56:55,691
to get what you want,
861
00:56:55,726 --> 00:56:58,524
then you're not
meant to have it.
862
00:56:58,562 --> 00:57:00,052
I don'tknow
if I'm worried
863
00:57:00,097 --> 00:57:02,895
more for them.
or worried for myself.
864
00:57:02,933 --> 00:57:04,628
lf one has a problem
865
00:57:04,668 --> 00:57:07,728
that seems
to be unsolvable...
866
00:57:07,771 --> 00:57:10,535
then perhaps one shouldn't
try to solve it.
867
00:57:10,574 --> 00:57:12,474
One should accept it.
868
00:57:12,509 --> 00:57:13,806
What do you mean?
869
00:57:13,844 --> 00:57:16,745
“God grant me
the serenity
870
00:57:16,780 --> 00:57:18,975
to accept the things
I cannot change,
871
00:57:19,015 --> 00:57:21,711
the courage to change
the things I can.
872
00:57:21,752 --> 00:57:24,812
and the wisdom toknow
the difference. “
873
00:57:26,890 --> 00:57:29,051
The wisdom's
the hard part.
874
00:57:29,092 --> 00:57:30,753
Mmm...
875
00:57:36,366 --> 00:57:38,596
I like Matthew.
876
00:57:38,635 --> 00:57:40,626
He's a good soul...
877
00:57:41,938 --> 00:57:43,701
for a Scotsman.
878
00:57:54,985 --> 00:57:57,180
What on earth did you
think you were doing?
879
00:57:57,220 --> 00:57:59,814
You can't just go hanging
around nasty pubs like that.
880
00:57:59,856 --> 00:58:01,153
You're bound to get
into trouble.
881
00:58:01,191 --> 00:58:03,250
Look, if you're trying
to meet a man.
882
00:58:03,293 --> 00:58:04,658
Iknow some
much better places.
883
00:58:04,694 --> 00:58:07,788
I wasn't trying
to meet a man.
884
00:58:10,400 --> 00:58:11,526
Keep waIking.
885
00:58:11,568 --> 00:58:14,093
Get out of here!
You'll get arrested !
886
00:58:14,137 --> 00:58:15,104
I need to taIk.
887
00:58:20,610 --> 00:58:21,907
Have you seen N icky?
888
00:58:21,945 --> 00:58:23,412
No. Where the hell
have you been?
889
00:58:23,446 --> 00:58:25,414
Grace had to get Harvey
to watch the plants.
890
00:58:25,448 --> 00:58:26,415
What?
891
00:58:26,449 --> 00:58:28,007
I took her to the station
this morning.
892
00:58:28,051 --> 00:58:29,040
She's gone to London.
893
00:58:29,085 --> 00:58:30,484
Oh. fuck!
894
00:58:33,023 --> 00:58:34,650
Where are we going?
895
00:58:36,026 --> 00:58:38,893
44 Wilberforce Street,
S.W. 3.
896
00:58:44,100 --> 00:58:46,933
Why don't you get your young
Scottish friend to help?
897
00:58:46,970 --> 00:58:49,871
Surely he'd have a better idea
how to go about it?
898
00:58:49,906 --> 00:58:51,771
No, his girlfriend's
pregnant.
899
00:58:51,808 --> 00:58:53,400
He can't get into trouble.
900
00:58:55,679 --> 00:58:58,045
I just want you to ring
a dealer, that's all.
901
00:58:58,081 --> 00:58:59,241
No.
902
00:58:59,282 --> 00:59:01,307
Grace, it's mad.
You'll end up in jail.
903
00:59:01,351 --> 00:59:03,182
I'm not going
to give up.
904
00:59:04,254 --> 00:59:06,051
Call a dealer.
905
00:59:09,693 --> 00:59:11,854
How do youknow
that Iknow one?
906
00:59:21,304 --> 00:59:23,101
On one condition
907
00:59:23,139 --> 00:59:25,630
that you let me lend you
an outfit that's...
908
00:59:26,676 --> 00:59:28,166
not that.
909
00:59:54,938 --> 00:59:56,462
Kelly.
Sir?
910
00:59:56,506 --> 00:59:58,030
Get me the times of trains
to Cornwall tomorrow.
911
00:59:58,074 --> 00:59:59,166
Yes. sir.
912
01:00:00,210 --> 01:00:03,441
Draw... spllff...
913
01:00:04,547 --> 01:00:06,174
Puff...
914
01:00:06,216 --> 01:00:07,308
Shit...
915
01:00:07,350 --> 01:00:09,784
Yes. thank you.
916
01:00:09,819 --> 01:00:12,310
Call it what
you will.
917
01:00:12,355 --> 01:00:13,947
but it's my bellef
918
01:00:13,990 --> 01:00:16,686
it is the door
to enllghtenment.
919
01:00:17,727 --> 01:00:19,388
I n your own time?
920
01:00:19,429 --> 01:00:22,330
And now,
the acid test.
921
01:00:36,446 --> 01:00:37,708
Jesus !
922
01:00:43,286 --> 01:00:44,719
I'll give you
60 quid for it.
923
01:00:47,691 --> 01:00:49,659
Don't be silly!
924
01:00:49,693 --> 01:00:51,058
70?
925
01:00:52,128 --> 01:00:53,891
No,
that's just a sample.
926
01:00:53,930 --> 01:00:55,921
I 've got 20kilos.
927
01:00:55,966 --> 01:00:58,400
20kilos. Grace? !
928
01:00:58,435 --> 01:00:59,902
No, no, no, no, no.
929
01:00:59,936 --> 01:01:01,460
You've got the wrong man.
930
01:01:01,504 --> 01:01:03,597
I mean.
I run a llmited eration.
931
01:01:03,640 --> 01:01:06,768
You're taIking...
You're taIking big leagues.
932
01:01:06,810 --> 01:01:08,937
Well. you just
got promoted.
933
01:01:08,979 --> 01:01:11,038
I don't have
thatkind of money.
934
01:01:11,081 --> 01:01:13,276
Well. do youknow
anybody who does?
935
01:01:13,316 --> 01:01:14,510
Well...
936
01:01:14,551 --> 01:01:16,519
I 've heard of someone.
937
01:01:18,288 --> 01:01:19,949
Call him.
938
01:01:19,990 --> 01:01:23,050
He's a bit heavy.
He's not like us.
939
01:01:23,093 --> 01:01:24,424
He's not...
940
01:01:24,461 --> 01:01:26,122
laid back.
941
01:01:26,162 --> 01:01:28,062
Call him.
942
01:01:34,137 --> 01:01:36,002
Come on. Honey!
943
01:01:36,039 --> 01:01:37,904
There she is.
No, wait, wait!
944
01:01:37,941 --> 01:01:39,932
You don'tknow who the guy is
I don't care who he is.
945
01:01:39,976 --> 01:01:42,706
He may be a drug dealer!
You can't wander into that!
946
01:01:42,746 --> 01:01:44,304
You've gotten
so bossy!
947
01:01:44,347 --> 01:01:46,781
You're so insensitive!
That could be dangerous !
948
01:01:46,816 --> 01:01:47,942
They're getting
away now!
949
01:01:47,984 --> 01:01:49,781
Well. follow them.
you dozy quack!
950
01:02:34,364 --> 01:02:37,026
J ust like a window display
at Harvey N ick's.
951
01:02:37,067 --> 01:02:38,830
There's a rave tonight.
We hold them here.
952
01:02:38,868 --> 01:02:40,597
What's a rave?
953
01:02:40,637 --> 01:02:42,229
Grace!
954
01:02:44,641 --> 01:02:46,040
Ah. merde!
955
01:02:49,312 --> 01:02:51,576
What have you
brought me, China?
956
01:02:51,614 --> 01:02:54,674
Two ladies.
and the fucking hippie.
957
01:02:54,717 --> 01:02:57,845
What do they want?
958
01:03:13,336 --> 01:03:15,702
Touche!
Sur la tete!
959
01:03:22,212 --> 01:03:23,679
You like to fish?
960
01:03:23,713 --> 01:03:26,409
Yes. Where I llve,
the fishing's wonderful.
961
01:03:26,449 --> 01:03:27,973
I hate it here.
962
01:03:28,852 --> 01:03:31,252
The fishing is terrible.
963
01:03:31,287 --> 01:03:33,255
I should visit you.
964
01:03:33,289 --> 01:03:34,756
Where do you llve?
965
01:03:37,560 --> 01:03:39,755
What's your name?
966
01:03:41,030 --> 01:03:42,429
Grace.
967
01:03:43,466 --> 01:03:45,024
Perfect.
968
01:03:45,068 --> 01:03:47,866
Hello?
969
01:03:47,904 --> 01:03:49,872
Cooey.
970
01:03:49,906 --> 01:03:51,498
Grace?
971
01:03:51,541 --> 01:03:53,634
Funny smell.
972
01:03:55,945 --> 01:03:56,912
Who's that?
973
01:03:56,946 --> 01:03:58,675
Oh !
974
01:03:58,715 --> 01:04:00,979
Harvey!
Where's Grace?
975
01:04:01,017 --> 01:04:02,882
We've come to finallze
the details
976
01:04:02,919 --> 01:04:05,979
of the women's institute visit.
Grace invited us to supper.
977
01:04:06,022 --> 01:04:08,217
It was arranged
ages ago.
978
01:04:08,258 --> 01:04:09,282
You got to get out.
979
01:04:09,325 --> 01:04:12,522
No. We have to speak
to Grace.
980
01:04:12,562 --> 01:04:14,325
No, you have
to leave.
981
01:04:14,364 --> 01:04:15,956
It's the plants.
you see.
982
01:04:15,999 --> 01:04:17,557
They're very dellcate.
983
01:04:17,600 --> 01:04:19,261
They're speciaI orchids
from Peru.
984
01:04:19,302 --> 01:04:20,860
Oh. these aren't orchids.
985
01:04:20,904 --> 01:04:23,395
Aren't they?
No.
986
01:04:23,439 --> 01:04:24,736
They look more
like tea.
987
01:04:24,774 --> 01:04:26,173
Tea?
Mmm.
988
01:04:26,209 --> 01:04:27,335
Tea.
What a good idea.
989
01:04:27,377 --> 01:04:29,311
Let's... let's go
in thekitchen.
990
01:04:29,345 --> 01:04:30,778
and I'll make you
a lovely cup of tea.
991
01:04:30,813 --> 01:04:32,371
Well. I was
expecting supper.
992
01:04:32,415 --> 01:04:33,814
There's some ham left out.
993
01:04:33,850 --> 01:04:35,044
I canknock you up
a sandwich.
994
01:04:35,084 --> 01:04:36,483
And what is
that funny smell?
995
01:04:36,519 --> 01:04:38,111
Well. it's probably the ham.
It's been left out a bit,
996
01:04:38,154 --> 01:04:40,816
but it'll be all right.
997
01:04:47,764 --> 01:04:49,197
Mmm.
998
01:04:49,232 --> 01:04:51,223
Where did you get it?
999
01:04:51,267 --> 01:04:54,464
The pele I represent
wish to remain anonymous.
1000
01:04:54,504 --> 01:04:56,062
Ah. yes.
1001
01:04:56,105 --> 01:05:00,371
The pele I represent wish
to remain anonymous as well.
1002
01:05:00,410 --> 01:05:02,708
Maybe they are
the same pele, huh?
1003
01:05:02,745 --> 01:05:05,009
Can I go now?
1004
01:05:05,048 --> 01:05:07,039
I 've got to pick me daughter up
from flute practice.
1005
01:05:10,153 --> 01:05:11,916
How much do you have?
1006
01:05:11,955 --> 01:05:13,786
A lot.
Are you buying?
1007
01:05:15,358 --> 01:05:17,792
Why don't I just take it?
1008
01:05:17,827 --> 01:05:19,317
You don'tknow
where it is.
1009
01:05:19,362 --> 01:05:20,351
Ah. yeah.
1010
01:05:20,396 --> 01:05:22,830
I'm sure I can
get you to tell me.
1011
01:05:22,865 --> 01:05:25,060
What if I cut off
your fingers
1012
01:05:25,101 --> 01:05:26,591
one by one...
1013
01:05:26,636 --> 01:05:28,194
untiI you change
your mind?
1014
01:05:28,238 --> 01:05:30,934
Ohh...
1015
01:05:30,974 --> 01:05:33,272
All right! Nobody move!
I'm the pollce!
1016
01:05:33,309 --> 01:05:34,469
The whole place
is surrounded !
1017
01:05:38,181 --> 01:05:39,273
And you would be?
1018
01:05:39,315 --> 01:05:41,010
Hello, everyone.
1019
01:05:41,050 --> 01:05:43,985
Martin Bamford.
Are we too early for the rave?
1020
01:05:44,020 --> 01:05:45,487
I can't wait.
1021
01:05:45,521 --> 01:05:47,785
I just love... raving.
1022
01:05:47,824 --> 01:05:51,783
This has nothing to do with me.
Shut up, beardy weirdy.
1023
01:05:51,828 --> 01:05:53,455
Who's this guy?
1024
01:05:53,496 --> 01:05:56,056
That's my doctor.
1025
01:05:56,099 --> 01:05:57,726
This one?
1026
01:05:57,767 --> 01:05:58,734
My gardener.
1027
01:06:00,703 --> 01:06:02,068
Oh. nice.
1028
01:06:02,105 --> 01:06:03,732
Are we expecting
anyone else?
1029
01:06:03,773 --> 01:06:05,297
No.
1030
01:06:05,341 --> 01:06:07,172
Your cleaning lady,
perhaps?
1031
01:06:07,210 --> 01:06:09,405
No, no, no.
No one else.
1032
01:06:09,445 --> 01:06:10,878
Very well.
1033
01:06:10,913 --> 01:06:13,074
This is China.
He beats pele up for me.
1034
01:06:13,116 --> 01:06:14,083
Shall I ?
1035
01:06:14,117 --> 01:06:15,982
No, no! Please!
1036
01:06:16,019 --> 01:06:18,078
Matthew, take Dr. Bamford
and Honey
1037
01:06:18,121 --> 01:06:20,089

1038
01:06:20,123 --> 01:06:21,147
Please.
1039
01:06:24,193 --> 01:06:25,251
Please?
1040
01:06:33,436 --> 01:06:35,904
Excuse me.
1041
01:06:38,207 --> 01:06:39,606
Grace?
1042
01:06:39,642 --> 01:06:42,736
J ust wait for me

1043
01:06:45,615 --> 01:06:47,378
Shall I go, too?
1044
01:06:48,551 --> 01:06:49,518
No.
1045
01:07:02,965 --> 01:07:05,195
Sit down. please.
1046
01:07:16,512 --> 01:07:22,075
All the pele
I deaI with are scum.
1047
01:07:22,118 --> 01:07:24,712
I'm a lIttle scummy myself.
1048
01:07:24,754 --> 01:07:26,119
You're not scum.
1049
01:07:26,155 --> 01:07:28,020
That worries me.
1050
01:07:28,057 --> 01:07:29,922
I take exception to that.
1051
01:07:29,959 --> 01:07:32,951
I come from
a long llne of scum.
1052
01:07:32,995 --> 01:07:35,725
My dear late husband was
one of the scummiest men
1053
01:07:35,765 --> 01:07:37,630
to waIk the face
of this earth.
1054
01:07:37,667 --> 01:07:38,998
My apologies.
1055
01:07:39,035 --> 01:07:41,629
Yes. let's get to it,
shall we?
1056
01:07:41,671 --> 01:07:43,400
Three and a half akilo.
1057
01:07:43,439 --> 01:07:45,737
20kilos
in the first week,
1058
01:07:45,775 --> 01:07:47,743
and then 1 0kilos
two weeks later.
1059
01:07:47,777 --> 01:07:49,870
After that
we can do 20kilos
1060
01:07:49,912 --> 01:07:51,140
every four weeks.
1061
01:07:52,949 --> 01:07:54,974
Three for akilo.
And no more deals
1062
01:07:55,017 --> 01:07:55,949
untiI I see
the first batch.
1063
01:07:55,985 --> 01:07:57,680
Three and a quarter.
1064
01:07:57,720 --> 01:07:59,347
Done.
1065
01:08:00,323 --> 01:08:02,257
Oh. thank you !
1066
01:08:04,994 --> 01:08:06,052
You're welcome.
1067
01:08:08,865 --> 01:08:11,197
Can I offer you
a glass of wine?
1068
01:08:15,571 --> 01:08:17,539
I can't belleve
your friend fainted.
1069
01:08:20,877 --> 01:08:24,142
Do I look like I would cut
someone's finger off?
1070
01:08:28,818 --> 01:08:30,376
Oh. yes.
1071
01:08:30,420 --> 01:08:32,388
Thank you.
1072
01:08:39,862 --> 01:08:41,625
Are you sure you're going
to be all right?
1073
01:08:41,664 --> 01:08:43,427
Never feIt better,
Honey.
1074
01:08:43,466 --> 01:08:45,366
Now, headache pill.
straight to bed.
1075
01:08:45,401 --> 01:08:46,368
Don't go over
any bumps.
1076
01:08:46,402 --> 01:08:48,029
Good luck!
1077
01:08:49,172 --> 01:08:50,764
Come on. boys.
1078
01:08:54,944 --> 01:08:56,741
What do you think?
1079
01:08:56,779 --> 01:08:59,839
I'm not sure.
1080
01:08:59,882 --> 01:09:00,814
Follow them.
1081
01:09:01,851 --> 01:09:03,716
What'll I do
with the hippie?
1082
01:09:08,391 --> 01:09:10,882
Take him.
1083
01:09:10,927 --> 01:09:12,053
I can't.
1084
01:09:12,094 --> 01:09:13,755
My old lady's
expecting me.
1085
01:09:13,796 --> 01:09:16,128
We're having a “ Dungeons
and Dragons” night.
1086
01:09:18,868 --> 01:09:22,736
It's the regionaI final.
1087
01:09:22,772 --> 01:09:25,240
lf thatknife had sllpped.
I 'd be a dead man.
1088
01:09:25,274 --> 01:09:28,243
There'd be a dead body driving
this car back to Cornwall.
1089
01:09:28,277 --> 01:09:31,075
Don't be so stupid.
He was bluffing.
1090
01:09:31,113 --> 01:09:32,944
Look, as long as we
have the merchandise,
1091
01:09:32,982 --> 01:09:33,914
we have the power.
1092
01:09:33,950 --> 01:09:35,611
Excuse me,
do Iknow you?
1093
01:09:35,651 --> 01:09:37,812
What are you taIking about,
“merchandise and power”?
1094
01:09:37,854 --> 01:09:39,685
Look at you !
Look at the way you're dressed !
1095
01:09:39,722 --> 01:09:41,019
You're like
Ma fucking Baker!
1096
01:09:41,057 --> 01:09:43,287
Language!
Don't you “language” me!
1097
01:09:43,326 --> 01:09:44,987
I nearly got my fucking
throat cut for you !
1098
01:09:45,027 --> 01:09:46,494
Well. you're not even
supposed to be here.
1099
01:09:46,529 --> 01:09:49,657
Fine! Go ahead and do it yourself
with Jacques fucking Cousteau then !
1100
01:09:49,699 --> 01:09:51,633
I'm out!
What?
1101
01:10:25,635 --> 01:10:29,036
I can't find
Grace's plants anywhere.
1102
01:10:29,071 --> 01:10:32,336
This tea has the most
extraordinary aroma.
1103
01:10:32,375 --> 01:10:34,434
Darjeellng?
1104
01:10:34,477 --> 01:10:35,705
Trevethan.
1105
01:10:35,745 --> 01:10:38,145
Oh. Diana. you never...
1106
01:10:38,180 --> 01:10:40,205
J ust a lIttle cutting.
1107
01:10:40,249 --> 01:10:42,308
I do love fresh tea.
1108
01:10:42,351 --> 01:10:43,978
So do l. dear.
1109
01:10:44,020 --> 01:10:45,317
Give it here.
1110
01:10:49,225 --> 01:10:51,159
Oh. that's lovely.
1111
01:11:04,674 --> 01:11:06,938
I'm sorry
for shouting at you.
1112
01:11:13,482 --> 01:11:16,713
How else am I going
to get the money?
1113
01:11:16,752 --> 01:11:18,083
I don'tknow.
1114
01:11:20,389 --> 01:11:22,687
It's N icky.
1115
01:11:22,725 --> 01:11:24,386
N icky doesn't want
to be in a relationship
1116
01:11:24,427 --> 01:11:26,327
with somebody
who's irresponsible.
1117
01:11:26,362 --> 01:11:27,761
And I don't want to be
in a relationship
1118
01:11:27,797 --> 01:11:29,594
with somebody
who isn't N icky.
1119
01:11:31,934 --> 01:11:33,765
Ooh. that's better!
1120
01:11:33,803 --> 01:11:35,361
Ready for my breakfast now.
1121
01:11:35,404 --> 01:11:36,496
Come on !
1122
01:11:52,888 --> 01:11:55,118
For Christ's sake.
1123
01:11:55,157 --> 01:11:57,648
Okay, when we get back,
we harvest the plants.
1124
01:11:57,693 --> 01:11:59,593
and we get the stuff up
to your paI in London
1125
01:11:59,629 --> 01:12:00,789
and we never do it
again. okay?
1126
01:12:00,830 --> 01:12:02,354
Thank you.
1127
01:12:02,398 --> 01:12:04,457
We do it quick as well.
1128
01:12:04,500 --> 01:12:06,695
I don't want another
knife at my throat.
1129
01:12:08,671 --> 01:12:10,366
Do youknow,
this is the site
1130
01:12:10,406 --> 01:12:13,341
of the new
prosed B 323.
1131
01:12:13,376 --> 01:12:16,937
due for completion
early 2004.
1132
01:12:16,979 --> 01:12:18,571
I can't belleve

1133
01:12:18,614 --> 01:12:20,172
I mean. how could
you have lost 'em?
1134
01:12:20,216 --> 01:12:23,151
It's not as if there's
a lot of traffic about!
1135
01:12:23,185 --> 01:12:25,517
Look, I'm sorry,
all right?
1136
01:12:25,554 --> 01:12:27,522
I'm not a career
criminal.
1137
01:12:27,556 --> 01:12:30,047
I don't have
taillng abilIties.
1138
01:12:30,092 --> 01:12:31,616
Are you getting
llppy with me?
1139
01:12:31,661 --> 01:12:34,186
Don't start getting
llppy with me!
1140
01:12:34,230 --> 01:12:37,063
Right. I'm just trying
to make the best of it.
1141
01:12:37,099 --> 01:12:39,067
lf we're gonna come
all the way down here,
1142
01:12:39,101 --> 01:12:41,467
we might as well
enjoy a day out.
1143
01:12:41,504 --> 01:12:43,028
Get in the car.
1144
01:12:43,072 --> 01:12:45,040
J ust shut up
and get in the car!
1145
01:12:45,074 --> 01:12:47,702
You need to sort out
some sort of...
1146
01:12:47,743 --> 01:12:50,303
anger management
when you get home.
1147
01:12:51,881 --> 01:12:53,473
Harvey?
1148
01:12:54,650 --> 01:12:55,776
Grace.
1149
01:12:55,818 --> 01:12:58,013
You forgot about
your meeting with the W. l.
1150
01:12:58,054 --> 01:12:59,487
They went in the greenhouse.
It's all right,
1151
01:12:59,522 --> 01:13:00,784
I bluffed them.
1152
01:13:00,823 --> 01:13:03,553
And... N icky was here.
1153
01:13:03,592 --> 01:13:05,992
What did you tell her?
1154
01:13:06,028 --> 01:13:07,859
That you went to London
with Dr. Bamford
1155
01:13:07,897 --> 01:13:09,296
to help Grace
sell the drugs.
1156
01:13:09,331 --> 01:13:10,730
Oh. shit.
1157
01:13:10,766 --> 01:13:12,199
Grace, I have to go
and see her.
1158
01:13:12,234 --> 01:13:13,599
That's all right,
don't worry.
1159
01:13:13,636 --> 01:13:15,661
Harvey and I will start
on the greenhouse.
1160
01:13:15,705 --> 01:13:18,469
Come on. Harvey.
1161
01:13:18,507 --> 01:13:20,236
Thanks.
this'll do fine.
1162
01:13:20,276 --> 01:13:21,903
Do youknow
where Llac house is.
1163
01:13:21,944 --> 01:13:24,003
Mrs. Trevethan?
No.
1164
01:13:24,046 --> 01:13:26,241
Ah. I'll ask around.
Try the sh.
1165
01:13:26,282 --> 01:13:28,273
Keep the change.
Right o.

Thank you.
1167
01:13:47,236 --> 01:13:48,794
Hello, anybody home?

01:14:11,393 --> 01:14:12,360
Shh !

Would you like
some cornflakes?
1172
01:14:21,437 --> 01:14:23,337
They're heavenly.
1173
01:14:24,373 --> 01:14:27,206
U h. no, thank you.
I 've already eaten.
1174
01:14:43,092 --> 01:14:45,890
Would you like...
1175
01:14:45,928 --> 01:14:49,364
A choccy icey?
1176
01:14:49,398 --> 01:14:52,663
I'm. uh. looking

01:16:38,607 --> 01:16:40,040
No, no, no, no!
1211
01:16:40,075 --> 01:16:42,202
You can't swim !
You're pregnant!
1212
01:16:42,244 --> 01:16:45,236
 Now the picture
is completed 
1213
01:16:45,281 --> 01:16:48,216
 And two's becoming three 
1214
01:16:48,250 --> 01:16:50,377
 Oh. yeah 
1215
01:16:50,419 --> 01:16:52,683
 It's meant to be 
1216
01:16:53,656 --> 01:16:57,057
 This is no accident to me 
1217
01:16:57,092 --> 01:16:59,560
 Oh. yeah 
1218
01:16:59,595 --> 01:17:01,756
 It's meant to be 
1219
01:17:02,798 --> 01:17:05,699
 It's no coincidence to me 
1220
01:17:05,734 --> 01:17:08,294
Aa ahh !
1221
01:17:08,337 --> 01:17:10,362
Yeah !
1222
01:17:27,222 --> 01:17:31,352
Mrs. Trevethan?
It's Quentin Rhodes.
1223
01:17:31,393 --> 01:17:34,157
Harvey,
I cannot see that person.
1224
01:17:34,196 --> 01:17:36,323
Not now. You've got
to get rid of him !
1225
01:17:36,365 --> 01:17:38,299
What do I say?
I don'tknow!
1226
01:17:38,334 --> 01:17:41,098
Tell him anything !
Tell him I'm still in London.
1227
01:17:41,136 --> 01:17:43,229
tell him I 've been
kidnapped by allens.
1228
01:17:43,272 --> 01:17:44,296
anything !
1229
01:17:47,443 --> 01:17:49,240
Charlle, whiskey!
1230
01:17:49,278 --> 01:17:51,212
Thank God. I 've been trying
to reach you at the house.
1231
01:17:51,246 --> 01:17:53,043
No one will answer
the bloody phone!
1232
01:17:53,082 --> 01:17:54,049
What's wrong?
1233
01:17:54,083 --> 01:17:56,176
There were two men here
Londoners
1234
01:17:56,218 --> 01:17:57,378
asking about Grace.
1235
01:17:57,419 --> 01:17:59,819
I thought maybe Customs.
1236
01:18:09,965 --> 01:18:11,023
That's them.
1237
01:18:11,066 --> 01:18:13,057
Oh. shit!
What?
1238
01:18:13,102 --> 01:18:15,570
They're not Customs.
They're drug dealers from London.
1239
01:18:15,604 --> 01:18:17,333
Well. I was right
about London.
1240
01:18:17,373 --> 01:18:18,965
Charlle, come with me.
We'll go to the house.
1241
01:18:19,008 --> 01:18:21,135
N icky, go and wake Dr. Bamford.
Meet us up there.
1242
01:18:26,382 --> 01:18:28,282
Give me all these!
What's the matter with you?
1243
01:18:28,317 --> 01:18:30,148
Get up there!
1244
01:18:30,185 --> 01:18:31,652
How many times have
I got to tell you...
1245
01:18:34,590 --> 01:18:36,558
Alfred?
What is it?
1246
01:18:36,592 --> 01:18:38,560
The two men
who own this car,
1247
01:18:38,594 --> 01:18:40,186
they were just
in the pub.
1248
01:18:40,229 --> 01:18:42,720
I overheard them taIking
about salmon poaching.
1249
01:18:42,765 --> 01:18:44,164
how much
they enjoyed it.
1250
01:18:44,199 --> 01:18:45,962
Really?
Yeah.
1251
01:18:46,001 --> 01:18:48,094
Well. thanks. N icky.
There could be
1252
01:18:48,137 --> 01:18:50,901
a community service reward
in this for you.
1253
01:18:50,939 --> 01:18:51,906
Thanks.
1254
01:18:51,940 --> 01:18:53,965
I 've gotta go.
1255
01:18:54,009 --> 01:18:54,907
I'm pregnant.
1256
01:18:54,943 --> 01:18:56,433
Oh. yes. yes.
of course.
1257
01:19:00,849 --> 01:19:03,477
What are they doing here?
They're not on hollday, Grace.
1258
01:19:03,519 --> 01:19:05,350
But Jacques said
one week!
1259
01:19:05,387 --> 01:19:06,513
Well. he lled.
1260
01:19:06,555 --> 01:19:08,147
Oh. Quentin Rhodes
is here.
1261
01:19:08,190 --> 01:19:09,555
Who the fuck is
Quentin Rhodes?
1262
01:19:09,591 --> 01:19:11,354
Harvey's holding him off.
What are we going to do?
1263
01:19:11,393 --> 01:19:13,953
Let's get rid of this stuff,
and get this thing over with.
1264
01:19:18,600 --> 01:19:20,795
Jesus !
1265
01:19:31,447 --> 01:19:32,937
U p the hill.
1266
01:19:32,981 --> 01:19:34,710
Second house
on the left.
1267
01:19:45,060 --> 01:19:48,325
5 7 to base.
Suspects under surveillance.
1268
01:19:48,363 --> 01:19:50,228
Cy that.
On our way.
1269
01:19:57,706 --> 01:20:00,004
Mrs. Trevethan?
1270
01:20:00,042 --> 01:20:02,272
Grace,
I 've just come to warn you.
1271
01:20:02,311 --> 01:20:03,642
There are two men
around here
1272
01:20:03,679 --> 01:20:05,237
who are part
of a salmon
1273
01:20:11,520 --> 01:20:13,010
It's parsley.
1274
01:20:14,056 --> 01:20:15,614
It's marijuana. isn't it?
1275
01:20:17,559 --> 01:20:18,526
Yes.
1276
01:20:19,761 --> 01:20:21,729
Iknew you and Matthew
were growing it,
1277
01:20:21,763 --> 01:20:23,754
but I got no idea...
1278
01:20:23,799 --> 01:20:24,788
Youknew?
1279
01:20:24,833 --> 01:20:27,028
Well. I llve around here,
don't I ?
1280
01:20:27,069 --> 01:20:28,934
But seeing as how you had
financiaI troubles.
1281
01:20:28,971 --> 01:20:31,371
I thought I 'd turn
a bllnd eye to...
1282
01:20:31,406 --> 01:20:33,135
a bit of homegrown.
1283
01:20:33,175 --> 01:20:35,302
But, Grace...
1284
01:20:35,344 --> 01:20:38,313
this is a huge amount.
1285
01:20:41,183 --> 01:20:43,151
It's good stuff too,
isn't this?
1286
01:20:43,185 --> 01:20:44,652
Better than that shit
1287
01:20:44,686 --> 01:20:46,551
you were growing
up at the vicarage.
1288
01:20:46,588 --> 01:20:47,816
Youknew about that?
1289
01:20:47,856 --> 01:20:48,880
Mmm.
1290
01:20:48,924 --> 01:20:51,392
Alfred...
I n a few minutes.
1291
01:20:51,426 --> 01:20:53,189
we'll have got rid of it.
1292
01:20:53,228 --> 01:20:55,196
Can't you turn
your bllnd eye
1293
01:20:55,230 --> 01:20:56,663
just a lIttle bit
longer?
1294
01:20:56,698 --> 01:20:58,393
It's not
so much me, Grace.
1295
01:20:58,433 --> 01:21:00,663
It's the officers
on their way from H Q
1296
01:21:00,702 --> 01:21:02,533
which worry me.
1297
01:21:02,571 --> 01:21:03,970
God ! What are we
going to do?
1298
01:21:04,006 --> 01:21:05,667
lf I were you.
1299
01:21:05,707 --> 01:21:07,538
I 'd get rid of this
stuff bloody quick.
1300
01:21:07,576 --> 01:21:09,840
I'm gonna go and look
for poachers.
1301
01:21:20,255 --> 01:21:21,950
Excuse me a moment.
1302
01:21:44,746 --> 01:21:46,509
Ahem !
1303
01:21:48,684 --> 01:21:49,673
Who are you?
1304
01:21:49,718 --> 01:21:51,208
Who are you?
1305
01:21:51,253 --> 01:21:52,652
He asked first.
1306
01:21:52,688 --> 01:21:54,952
I'm here
to do some business...
1307
01:21:54,990 --> 01:21:57,550
with Mrs. Trevethan.
1308
01:21:57,593 --> 01:21:59,584
Oh. yeah?
1309
01:21:59,628 --> 01:22:01,892
Well. so are we.
1310
01:22:01,930 --> 01:22:03,625
Really?
1311
01:22:03,665 --> 01:22:06,691
Are you interested
in buying the prerty,
1312
01:22:06,735 --> 01:22:07,997
or do you have...
1313
01:22:08,036 --> 01:22:10,197
a claim on it
in some way?
1314
01:22:10,239 --> 01:22:12,264
What is this?
1315
01:22:17,879 --> 01:22:20,746
Well. there it is.
1316
01:22:20,782 --> 01:22:22,977
We did it.
1317
01:22:23,018 --> 01:22:25,851
We did. didn't we?
1318
01:22:27,589 --> 01:22:29,580
There's another two men here.
1319
01:22:29,625 --> 01:22:30,319
What are we gonna do?
1320
01:22:30,359 --> 01:22:31,257
Skin up.
1321
01:22:31,293 --> 01:22:33,386
Even you can't
smoke all of it.
1322
01:22:33,428 --> 01:22:34,417
I could try.
1323
01:22:34,463 --> 01:22:37,728
Maybe nobody should have
the bloody stuff.
1324
01:22:41,970 --> 01:22:43,494
All right.
1325
01:22:44,539 --> 01:22:45,631
Thank you. Matthew.
1326
01:22:45,674 --> 01:22:47,232
You're welcome, Grace.
1327
01:22:49,111 --> 01:22:51,409
Put that match out!
1328
01:22:51,446 --> 01:22:55,041
Look, I don'tknow
what's going on. but...
1329
01:22:55,083 --> 01:22:56,778
I think you'd better
put it out.
1330
01:22:58,420 --> 01:23:01,514
That is the most beautiful
and awesome thing
1331
01:23:01,556 --> 01:23:03,456
I 've ever seen
in my llfe.
1332
01:23:05,394 --> 01:23:06,361

01:23:09,564 --> 01:23:10,189

01:23:12,934 --> 01:23:14,333

Make a run for it.
1342
01:23:28,917 --> 01:23:29,884
What about you.
Grace?
1343
01:23:29,918 --> 01:23:32,318
Don't worry about me.
I can handle this.
1344
01:23:32,354 --> 01:23:34,015
No, we did this together.
I'm staying.
1345
01:23:34,056 --> 01:23:36,524
Look, I love you both
very much indeed.
1346
01:23:36,558 --> 01:23:38,822
but, Matthew...
you're fired.
1347
01:23:38,860 --> 01:23:40,418
Come on.
1348
01:23:57,879 --> 01:23:59,813
Argh !
St it!
1349
01:23:59,848 --> 01:24:02,043
Get off, get off!
1350
01:24:02,084 --> 01:24:04,917
That's it, man !
You arrest him.
1351
01:24:04,953 --> 01:24:06,045
Whoa. whoa. whoa !
1352
01:24:06,088 --> 01:24:07,521
What are you
arresting me for?
1353
01:24:07,556 --> 01:24:09,683
No, madam !
St there!
1354
01:24:09,725 --> 01:24:10,714
Right.
1355
01:24:28,210 --> 01:24:29,336
Wait! Wait!
1356
01:24:32,581 --> 01:24:34,481
Hello, Grace.
1357
01:24:52,200 --> 01:24:53,462
Wow!
1358
01:24:55,070 --> 01:24:57,300
I trusted you.
1359
01:24:57,339 --> 01:25:00,365
Whatever happened to honor
amongst thieves?
1360
01:25:00,409 --> 01:25:01,842
What about our deal?
1361
01:25:02,644 --> 01:25:04,475
It's nice to see you too.
1362
01:25:04,513 --> 01:25:06,572
Can't even do
your own dirty work.
1363
01:25:06,615 --> 01:25:07,843
“ Dirty work”?
1364
01:25:07,883 --> 01:25:09,373
Why did you
send in your boys?
1365
01:25:09,418 --> 01:25:11,511
Tokeep an eye on you.
1366
01:25:11,553 --> 01:25:14,044
To st you
from coming to any harm.
1367
01:25:14,089 --> 01:25:16,455
Do you expect me
to belleve that?
1368
01:25:16,491 --> 01:25:18,584
It's the truth.
1369
01:25:20,896 --> 01:25:23,091
I he I haven't
spoiled everything.
1370
01:25:32,941 --> 01:25:34,806
Were you trying to escape?
1371
01:25:37,345 --> 01:25:40,610
Maybe... I could help.
1372
01:25:40,649 --> 01:25:42,276
No, thank you.
1373
01:25:47,823 --> 01:25:49,688
Mrs. Trevethan !
1374
01:25:49,758 --> 01:25:51,419
Grace!
1375
01:25:53,261 --> 01:25:57,254
Those fingers
through my hair
1376
01:25:57,299 --> 01:26:00,291
That sly
come hither stare... 
1377
01:26:01,503 --> 01:26:04,267
That strips
my conscience bare
1378
01:26:04,306 --> 01:26:06,968
It's witchcraft
1379
01:26:09,277 --> 01:26:13,771
And I 've got
no defense for it
1380
01:26:13,815 --> 01:26:17,444
The heat is
too intense for it
1381
01:26:17,486 --> 01:26:22,116
What good would
common sense for it do?
1382
01:26:24,793 --> 01:26:26,920
'Cause it's witchcraft 
1383
01:26:29,030 --> 01:26:31,590
Witchcraft 
1384
01:26:31,633 --> 01:26:32,725
I like it here.
1385
01:26:32,767 --> 01:26:36,168
And although I know
1386
01:26:36,204 --> 01:26:41,198
It's strictly taboo... 
1387
01:26:47,148 --> 01:26:50,083
Is this the face
of a master criminal?
1388
01:26:50,118 --> 01:26:51,779
Tonight we investigate
the mystery
1389
01:26:51,820 --> 01:26:54,152
behind Grace Trevethan.
1390
01:26:54,189 --> 01:26:56,987
How did an unknown widow
facing bankruptcy
1391
01:26:57,025 --> 01:26:59,516
save her house and become
the most celebrated
1392
01:26:59,561 --> 01:27:01,358
and controversiaI novellst
of the year?
1393
01:27:03,131 --> 01:27:05,622
Mrs. Trevethan's novel.
“The Joint Venture, “
1394
01:27:05,667 --> 01:27:08,636
has tped the best seller llst
for over a year now.
1395
01:27:08,670 --> 01:27:10,604
But aIthough the book
is sold as fiction.
1396
01:27:10,639 --> 01:27:12,869
the story bears
a remarkable similarity
1397
01:27:12,908 --> 01:27:14,899
to Trevethan's own llfe.
1398
01:27:14,943 --> 01:27:18,572
And her recent marriage to a
mysterious french businessman
1399
01:27:18,613 --> 01:27:20,547
has fueled
tabloid speculation
1400
01:27:20,582 --> 01:27:22,277
that she was at one time
1401
01:27:22,317 --> 01:27:24,512
actually involved
with the drug trade.
1402
01:27:24,553 --> 01:27:27,021
So, what is the true story?
1403
01:27:27,055 --> 01:27:29,785
We went to the sleepy village
of Port Llac to find out.
1404
01:27:29,824 --> 01:27:31,792
Turn it up, Charlle.
Turn it up.
1405
01:27:31,826 --> 01:27:34,260
Wasn't there an incident
up at Llac house?
1406
01:27:34,296 --> 01:27:36,230
The pollce were called
to the house
1407
01:27:36,264 --> 01:27:38,027
but there was a problem
with witnesses.
1408
01:27:38,066 --> 01:27:39,556
No one wanted to taIk?
1409
01:27:39,601 --> 01:27:41,228
Nobody could
remember anything.
1410
01:27:41,269 --> 01:27:42,463
Excuse me.
1411
01:27:44,005 --> 01:27:46,200
We think it's fiction.
don't we, dear?
1412
01:27:46,241 --> 01:27:47,367
Yes.
1413
01:27:47,409 --> 01:27:50,207
Because in the book,
1414
01:27:50,245 --> 01:27:52,713
Grace was growing drugs.
1415
01:27:52,747 --> 01:27:55,477
but in reaI llfe,
she was growing tea !
1416
01:27:57,452 --> 01:28:00,012
Well. as a doctor,
uh. a man of science...
1417
01:28:03,191 --> 01:28:05,091
Obviously I could never
condone the use of a drug
1418
01:28:05,126 --> 01:28:07,856
for nontherapeutic,
um... thingy.
1419
01:28:07,896 --> 01:28:09,659
Psst, psst, psst.
1420
01:28:09,698 --> 01:28:11,290
Have you got
anything?
1421
01:28:11,333 --> 01:28:12,891
See me later.
Okay.
1422
01:28:12,934 --> 01:28:13,832
It's good.
I s it?
1423
01:28:13,868 --> 01:28:15,165
Oh. yeah !
Oh.
1424
01:28:15,203 --> 01:28:17,797
I must say,
it does seem strange
1425
01:28:17,839 --> 01:28:20,899
that alcohoI is legal
and marijuana...
1426
01:28:20,942 --> 01:28:22,000
U h. isn't.
1427
01:28:22,043 --> 01:28:24,204
An accident of history,
I suppose.
1428
01:28:30,151 --> 01:28:31,778
So you didn't have
any marijuana
1429
01:28:31,820 --> 01:28:33,310
growing in your garden?
1430
01:28:34,756 --> 01:28:36,451
Bless you.
1431
01:28:38,293 --> 01:28:39,817
So do you think
“The Joint Venture”
1432
01:28:39,861 --> 01:28:41,158
is fiction or fact?
1433
01:28:41,196 --> 01:28:42,629
No, it's all fiction.
1434
01:28:42,664 --> 01:28:45,827
My wife has a very fertile
imagination. thank God.
1435
01:28:45,867 --> 01:28:48,028
But what about the gangster
character, “Pedro”?
1436
01:28:48,069 --> 01:28:49,536
I s that based on you?
1437
01:28:49,571 --> 01:28:52,369
Pedro is Spanish.
I'm French. Don't be absurd.
1438
01:28:52,407 --> 01:28:54,773
No, but we've heard
It's time for you to go.
1439
01:28:54,809 --> 01:28:56,902
Get off my land. I said !
This my house!
1440
01:28:58,480 --> 01:29:00,880
Yet Mrs. Trevethan
refused to be interviewed
1441
01:29:00,915 --> 01:29:02,382
for this program...
1442
01:29:03,685 --> 01:29:05,710
...and to date has made
no publlc statement
1443
01:29:05,754 --> 01:29:08,279
about the rumors.
Tonight may change that
1444
01:29:08,323 --> 01:29:11,349
as we take you llve,
to the New York Book Awards.
1445
01:29:11,393 --> 01:29:14,157
where Grace Trevethan
has been shortllsted
1446
01:29:14,195 --> 01:29:15,492
for “The Joint Venture. “
1447
01:29:15,530 --> 01:29:19,830
And the winner of the award
for fiction goes to...
1448
01:29:23,171 --> 01:29:25,002
Grace Trevethan
1449
01:29:25,040 --> 01:29:27,406
for “The Joint Venture” !
1450
01:29:41,656 --> 01:29:43,647
What a surprise!
1451
01:29:43,692 --> 01:29:45,990
Shh ! Shh !
1452
01:29:46,027 --> 01:29:48,052
You'd think I 'd be used
to surprises
1453
01:29:48,096 --> 01:29:51,224
after everything
that's happened to me.
1454
01:29:51,266 --> 01:29:54,463
Iknow there's been
a lot of speculation about
1455
01:29:54,502 --> 01:29:57,198
whether my book is based
on fact or fiction.
1456
01:29:57,238 --> 01:29:58,569
but...
1457
01:29:58,606 --> 01:30:01,666
well... to tell you the truth.
1458
01:30:01,710 --> 01:30:04,144
if I told you everything
that's happened to me
1459
01:30:04,179 --> 01:30:05,578
over the past couple
of years.
1460
01:30:05,613 --> 01:30:07,274
you wouldn't
belleve me anyway.
1461
01:30:07,315 --> 01:30:10,113
I can hardly
belleve it myself.
1462
01:30:10,151 --> 01:30:11,584
Oh...
1463
01:30:11,619 --> 01:30:13,814
Oh. I he they're
watching this at home,
1464
01:30:13,855 --> 01:30:15,322
because...
1465
01:30:15,356 --> 01:30:16,653
I wanted to say...
1466
01:30:20,829 --> 01:30:22,694
Matthew...
1467
01:30:22,731 --> 01:30:24,062
I wanted to tell you
1468
01:30:24,099 --> 01:30:27,193
that I think you are
a terrible gardener...
1469
01:30:29,370 --> 01:30:31,998
but that you've helped me
to grow,
1470
01:30:32,040 --> 01:30:34,406
and for that...
1471
01:30:34,442 --> 01:30:37,843
I thank you from
the bottom of my heart.
1472
01:30:40,315 --> 01:30:42,545
I he you're all having
a wonderfuI party...
1473
01:30:47,589 --> 01:30:49,750
Oh. and I 've had
another idea.
1474
01:30:49,791 --> 01:30:52,658
and I think there
might be a book in it.
1475
01:30:57,165 --> 01:30:58,530
Thank you.
1476
01:31:02,103 --> 01:31:04,867
 Sometimes
there's no explanation 
1477
01:31:04,906 --> 01:31:06,999
 Only what you feel 
1478
01:31:07,041 --> 01:31:09,168
 And I knew
you'd always be here 
1479
01:31:09,210 --> 01:31:11,303
 Watching over me 
1480
01:31:11,346 --> 01:31:14,008
 You're no accidentaI angeI 
1481
01:31:14,048 --> 01:31:15,982
 Falling down on me 
1482
01:31:16,017 --> 01:31:18,451
 Now the picture is completed 
1483
01:31:18,486 --> 01:31:20,750
 And two's becoming three 
1484
01:31:20,789 --> 01:31:23,349
 Oh oh 
1485
01:31:23,391 --> 01:31:27,122
 It's meant to be 
1486
01:31:27,162 --> 01:31:30,791
 This is no accident,
you see 
1487
01:31:57,892 --> 01:32:02,056
 You're turning my world
upside down 
1488
01:32:02,096 --> 01:32:05,395
 My head is spinning 
1489
01:32:05,433 --> 01:32:07,094
 with the clouds 
1490
01:32:07,135 --> 01:32:11,629
 I 'd gladly give you
all of me 
1491
01:32:11,673 --> 01:32:14,107
 'Cause some things
can't wait 
1492
01:32:14,142 --> 01:32:16,508
 for eternity 
1493
01:32:17,545 --> 01:32:20,810
 No longer playing
with daydreams 
1494
01:32:21,950 --> 01:32:26,080
 No longer waiting
for maybes 
1495
01:32:26,120 --> 01:32:30,113
 And now I know
you would save me 
1496
01:32:31,159 --> 01:32:34,492
 Oh oh oh oh 
1497
01:32:34,529 --> 01:32:36,690
 Oh oh 
1498
01:32:36,731 --> 01:32:39,199
 It's meant to be 
1499
01:32:40,401 --> 01:32:42,926
 This is no accident,
you see 
1500
01:32:42,971 --> 01:32:45,599
 You're no accidentaI angeI 
1501
01:32:45,640 --> 01:32:47,437
 Falllng down on me 
1502
01:32:47,475 --> 01:32:49,943
 Now the picture is completed 
1503
01:32:49,978 --> 01:32:51,912
 And two's becoming three 
1504
01:32:51,946 --> 01:32:54,779
 Sometimes
there's no explanation 
1505
01:32:54,816 --> 01:32:56,511
 Only what you feel 
1506
01:32:56,551 --> 01:32:59,076
 And Iknew
you'd always be here 
1507
01:32:59,120 --> 01:33:01,054
 Watching over me 
1508
01:33:01,089 --> 01:33:03,614
 There's no point in hesitating 
1509
01:33:03,658 --> 01:33:05,626
 When you have
something so reaI 
1510
01:33:05,660 --> 01:33:08,390
 So just run

 Oh. yeah

 It's meant to be 
1518
01:33:26,114 --> 01:33:29,208
 This is no accident to me 
1519
01:33:29,250 --> 01:33:31,616
 Oh. yeah

 And two's becoming three 
1526

 Sometimes
there's no explanation 
1527
01:34:07,855 --> 01:34:10,016
 Only what you feel

 There's no point
in hesitating

 When you have
something so real 
1532
01:34:19,133 --> 01:34:21,533
 You just run
with your emotions 
1533
01:34:21,569 --> 01:34:23,628
 Before they disappear
