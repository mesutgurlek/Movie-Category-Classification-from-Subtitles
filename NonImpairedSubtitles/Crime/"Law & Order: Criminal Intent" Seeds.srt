00:00:00,676 --> 00:00:03,246
In New York City's war on crime,

2
00:00:03,246 --> 00:00:06,547
the worst criminal offenders
are pursued by the detectives

3
00:00:06,547 --> 00:00:08,208
of the Major Case Squad.

4
00:00:08,208 --> 00:00:10,217
These are their stories.

5
00:00:12,376 --> 00:00:15,160
Who the hell does he think he is, god?

6
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:18,001
Look, I know how you feel,
but you need to calm down.

7
00:00:18,001 --> 00:00:20,228
Calm down? This is my son.

8
00:00:20,228 --> 00:00:21,415
Is everything all right...

9
00:00:21,415 --> 00:00:23,678
You're the guy I want to talk to.

10
00:00:28,468 --> 00:00:31,902
No, I'm not talking about it.
It's done.

11
00:00:31,902 --> 00:00:33,208
And it doesn't matter what I think?

12
00:00:33,208 --> 00:00:35,411
No. I run the business.

13
00:00:35,411 --> 00:00:36,757
You're my little brother, and I love you,

14
00:00:36,757 --> 00:00:40,476
but stick to what you do best...
delivering babies.

15
00:00:42,933 --> 00:00:45,387
It's happening. Call Dr. Rush.

16
00:00:45,387 --> 00:00:46,577
Is this your first?

17
00:00:46,577 --> 00:00:48,415
Un-huh. She's having contractions.

18
00:00:48,415 --> 00:00:50,303
Have a seat.
I need you to fill these out.

19
00:00:50,303 --> 00:00:52,994
And I need your insurance card.

20
00:00:57,511 --> 00:00:59,135
Jason, where the hell have you been?

21
00:00:59,135 --> 00:01:01,057
I called, mom.

22
00:01:02,694 --> 00:01:05,066
Where the hell have you been?

23
00:01:08,298 --> 00:01:11,506
- I'm sure he's on his way.
- And when he arrives,

24
00:01:11,506 --> 00:01:13,350
I have a very nice table
waiting for the two of you.

25
00:01:13,350 --> 00:01:14,879
Hi. / Eli.

26
00:01:14,879 --> 00:01:15,993
Sorry I'm so late.

27
00:01:15,993 --> 00:01:19,196
I got called in to the hospital,
Emergency c-section, triplets.

28
00:01:19,196 --> 00:01:20,647
Triplets?

29
00:01:20,647 --> 00:01:22,489
Thank god they all made it.

30
00:01:22,489 --> 00:01:23,941
You look fantastic.

31
00:01:23,941 --> 00:01:26,232
I'll show you to your table, Dr. Rush.

32
00:01:28,918 --> 00:01:30,452
All right already. I'm here.

33
00:01:30,452 --> 00:01:33,056
Where's Dr. Rush?
I think it's time.

34
00:01:33,945 --> 00:01:35,217
This baby is coming.

35
00:01:35,217 --> 00:01:37,854
Get that son of a bitch here now!

36
00:01:47,884 --> 00:01:51,471
- Shouldn't you take that?
- No.

37
00:01:52,016 --> 00:01:53,843
My brother's on call.

38
00:01:54,403 --> 00:01:56,133
Where were we?

ORIGINAL AIR DATE ON USA: 2007/10/11

50
00:02:57,414 --> 00:03:01,229
The wig's in the closet,
put my lipstick on and you're good.

51
00:03:01,229 --> 00:03:02,442
Gotta go.

52
00:03:02,814 --> 00:03:05,200
Hey, sorry I'm late.
What do we got?

53
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:07,966
Relax, Falacci. I just got here myself.

54
00:03:07,966 --> 00:03:11,398
I know it's your day off,
but it is what it is.

55
00:03:11,398 --> 00:03:14,224
Trust me, I'll take a crime scene
over playing a clown

56
00:03:14,224 --> 00:03:17,604
at the neighbor's kid's birthday
party any day. / Yeah.

57
00:03:18,187 --> 00:03:20,981
Dr. Zach Rush, 42. OB-GYN.

58
00:03:20,981 --> 00:03:23,121
That blood trail leads
right into the exam room

59
00:03:23,121 --> 00:03:24,951
where he's trussed up on the table.

60
00:03:24,951 --> 00:03:27,162
That's the primary crime scene.

61
00:03:28,660 --> 00:03:29,808
Who found him?

62
00:03:29,808 --> 00:03:31,170
His brother Eli.

63
00:03:31,170 --> 00:03:34,437
They share the practice.
He called 911 around 3:00 A.M.

64
00:03:34,437 --> 00:03:37,057
He's around the corner at Zach's
apartment comforting the wife.

65
00:03:37,057 --> 00:03:38,825
Get him back here.

66
00:03:43,127 --> 00:03:44,630
It's bleach.

67
00:03:44,630 --> 00:03:46,977
Just on these blood droplets.

68
00:03:46,977 --> 00:03:49,348
Killer's trying to cover his own DNA.

69
00:03:49,348 --> 00:03:52,071
Might have cut himself on this.

70
00:03:52,607 --> 00:03:56,922
Photo cube.
Turned into a murder weapon.

71
00:04:01,811 --> 00:04:03,315
Blunt trauma.

72
00:04:03,315 --> 00:04:07,253
Bits of glass in the face and scalp.

73
00:04:07,253 --> 00:04:09,751
Lacerations around the mouth.

74
00:04:09,751 --> 00:04:13,172
What's that doing on the floor?
Let's bag this.

75
00:04:16,729 --> 00:04:19,838
Pretty advanced rigor.
Stiff but not rigid.

76
00:04:19,838 --> 00:04:25,320
Puts the time of death at somewhere
between 8:00 and 10:00 P.M.

77
00:04:26,094 --> 00:04:29,146
Homicide investigator's masters class.

78
00:04:29,146 --> 00:04:31,789
I'll have to check that out some day.

79
00:04:32,223 --> 00:04:36,124
Hey, there's something off here.
Look at his belt.

80
00:04:36,124 --> 00:04:38,117
It's out of half the loops.

81
00:04:38,117 --> 00:04:40,137
Victim's brother's here.

82
00:04:46,616 --> 00:04:50,342
I saw Zach around 7:00 last night
before I went on a date.

83
00:04:50,342 --> 00:04:51,359
He was on call.

84
00:04:51,359 --> 00:04:53,623
So what were you doing
back here at 3:00 A.M.?

85
00:04:53,623 --> 00:04:55,460
Zach wasn't answering his cell.

86
00:04:55,460 --> 00:04:58,004
The hospital called me for a delivery.

87
00:04:58,004 --> 00:05:00,058
After I finished,
I still couldn't get through to Zach.

88
00:05:00,058 --> 00:05:02,109
So I came to the office.

89
00:05:02,109 --> 00:05:04,498
And you found Zach on the exam table?

90
00:05:04,498 --> 00:05:07,202
It was horrible finding him like that.

91
00:05:07,202 --> 00:05:10,114
Is that why you pulled his pants up?

92
00:05:11,354 --> 00:05:14,079
I'm a medical professional.
I should have known better.

93
00:05:14,079 --> 00:05:17,739
But he was my brother,
and I panicked.

94
00:05:17,739 --> 00:05:19,248
I understand.

95
00:05:19,510 --> 00:05:20,845
What else did you do?

96
00:05:20,845 --> 00:05:25,070
There was an instrument lodged
in his mouth when I found him.

97
00:05:25,070 --> 00:05:26,065
The speculum.

98
00:05:26,065 --> 00:05:29,421
I took it out, and tried to
give him mouth to mouth.

99
00:05:29,421 --> 00:05:33,084
There must have been glass on his face.
I cut myself.

100
00:05:33,084 --> 00:05:35,245
Well, we're gonna need
a sample of your blood.

101
00:05:35,245 --> 00:05:38,227
- So we can see which DNA is which.
- Of course.

102
00:05:38,227 --> 00:05:41,775
Uh, doc, one more thing.
Does your office perform abortions?

103
00:05:41,775 --> 00:05:43,218
What?

104
00:05:43,903 --> 00:05:45,916
From the body's staging,

105
00:05:45,916 --> 00:05:49,900
looks like someone might have
been trying to send a message.

106
00:05:51,110 --> 00:05:53,490
My brother did terminations.
Not me.

107
00:05:53,490 --> 00:05:55,297
Well, we're gonna have
to look at that angle.

108
00:05:55,297 --> 00:05:57,244
Who handles your appointment records?

109
00:05:57,244 --> 00:06:00,067
Helen Combs, our office manager.

110
00:06:00,612 --> 00:06:02,254
Are you sure it wasn't a robbery?

111
00:06:02,254 --> 00:06:04,100
Miss Combs, the drug
cabinets were locked,

112
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:05,755
and his script pads were still in his desk.

113
00:06:05,755 --> 00:06:07,041
It makes no sense.

114
00:06:07,041 --> 00:06:08,182
Who would do this to him?

115
00:06:08,182 --> 00:06:10,608
We understand that
he performed abortions.

116
00:06:10,608 --> 00:06:14,003
Just for his regular patients.
We were under the radar of fanatics.

117
00:06:14,003 --> 00:06:15,484
Still a very sensitive issue.

118
00:06:15,484 --> 00:06:17,999
Do you recall any boyfriends, husbands,
who were particularly upset?

119
00:06:17,999 --> 00:06:19,519
No.

120
00:06:19,519 --> 00:06:21,820
These beautiful babies.

121
00:06:21,820 --> 00:06:23,717
His patients loved Dr. Zach.

122
00:06:23,717 --> 00:06:25,811
Well, what about employees?

123
00:06:25,811 --> 00:06:29,181
I mean, sometimes
when you do your job right,

124
00:06:29,181 --> 00:06:30,797
people still don't like you.

125
00:06:30,797 --> 00:06:35,169
Well, there's me, the girls, and Tom.

126
00:06:35,169 --> 00:06:38,878
Oh, both the brothers were
upset with him.

127
00:06:38,878 --> 00:06:41,129
- Tom who?
- Tom Pittino, our genetics counselor.

128
00:06:41,129 --> 00:06:42,557
Comes in once a week.

129
00:06:42,557 --> 00:06:45,883
Something was going on with
one of his clients yesterday.

130
00:06:46,209 --> 00:06:49,458
I council patients about their options.
These are tough decisions.

131
00:06:49,458 --> 00:06:52,060
"their options"?
You mean "abortion," don't you?

132
00:06:52,060 --> 00:06:55,780
Sometimes there are no easy answers.
People get emotional.

133
00:06:55,780 --> 00:06:59,687
Do they get emotional?
Or do they get angry?

134
00:07:00,833 --> 00:07:03,024
And we heard you had a problem
with Dr. Rush's yesterday.

135
00:07:03,024 --> 00:07:04,908
You wanna tell us what that was about?

136
00:07:04,908 --> 00:07:07,288
Not me.
A client was upset with Zach.

137
00:07:07,288 --> 00:07:09,566
Keep going. Who was the patient?

138
00:07:09,566 --> 00:07:10,837
You know I can't tell you that.

139
00:07:10,837 --> 00:07:13,618
Fine. We'll get a court order.

140
00:07:18,434 --> 00:07:20,645
Jason, is that vodka?

141
00:07:20,645 --> 00:07:22,569
You would know.

142
00:07:24,927 --> 00:07:26,245
- Mrs. Rush.
- Hmm?

143
00:07:26,245 --> 00:07:29,489
- You might not remember me.
- Of course, um...

144
00:07:29,489 --> 00:07:32,732
Tom, you're the new counselor.

145
00:07:32,732 --> 00:07:35,563
Your husband was a good man.

146
00:07:35,784 --> 00:07:37,005
Thank you.

147
00:07:37,005 --> 00:07:39,562
Paula, your mother's leaving.

148
00:07:39,789 --> 00:07:41,604
Excuse me.

149
00:07:43,287 --> 00:07:46,135
He's a strange guy.
How are you holding up?

150
00:07:46,135 --> 00:07:47,586
Get me another.

151
00:07:47,586 --> 00:07:50,889
And keep an eye on Jason.
And stay out of my way.

152
00:08:05,620 --> 00:08:09,166
Could you get your dog to heel?
He's making my partner nervous.

153
00:08:09,166 --> 00:08:13,668
Flynn, heel. Shh. Heel.
Good girl.

154
00:08:13,668 --> 00:08:15,481
I'm the patient with a record.

155
00:08:15,481 --> 00:08:18,240
So I lose my right to confidentiality.

156
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:21,999
Well, you, uh...
You did sic your dogs on a teenager.

157
00:08:21,999 --> 00:08:23,557
He was 19.

158
00:08:23,557 --> 00:08:27,322
He was making it with my 14-year-old.
What would you do?

159
00:08:29,395 --> 00:08:32,005
Your fight with Dr. Rush,
you wanna tell us about that?

160
00:08:32,005 --> 00:08:34,316
The man talked my wife
into having an abortion.

161
00:08:34,316 --> 00:08:35,812
And you think abortion is murder?

162
00:08:35,812 --> 00:08:37,681
No, that's not it.

163
00:08:38,594 --> 00:08:41,326
My wife was carrying a boy
with spina bifida.

164
00:08:41,326 --> 00:08:43,767
Severe.
But I wanted the baby anyway.

165
00:08:43,767 --> 00:08:45,040
They didn't consult you?

166
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:47,762
No, the bastard just killed my boy.

167
00:08:48,045 --> 00:08:49,881
I've got three daughters.

168
00:08:49,881 --> 00:08:52,294
He was gonna be my son.

169
00:08:52,294 --> 00:08:53,834
Where were you Monday night?

170
00:08:53,834 --> 00:08:55,982
In the park training my dogs.

171
00:08:55,982 --> 00:08:57,286
Anybody see you?

172
00:08:57,286 --> 00:08:59,884
They're not always the most
social animals in the world.

173
00:08:59,884 --> 00:09:01,424
So that would be a "no"?

174
00:09:01,424 --> 00:09:02,426
We're not talking,

175
00:09:02,426 --> 00:09:04,137
but my wife,
she saw me leave the house.

176
00:09:04,137 --> 00:09:05,681
She saw me go home.

177
00:09:05,681 --> 00:09:09,838
- Okay. That's a beautiful dog.
- Yes, she is.

178
00:09:12,077 --> 00:09:14,697
I agonized over the decision.

179
00:09:14,697 --> 00:09:19,474
George wanted a son, but he had no idea
what it would do to our family.

180
00:09:19,474 --> 00:09:21,669
How did George take it?

181
00:09:21,890 --> 00:09:23,209
Emma?

182
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:26,265
Uh, he...

183
00:09:26,265 --> 00:09:28,708
He's still furious.

184
00:09:28,708 --> 00:09:31,918
Every night, I come home.
George goes out.

185
00:09:31,918 --> 00:09:34,401
Just paces with the dogs.

186
00:09:34,401 --> 00:09:37,864
- Was he pacing Monday night?
- Till 1:00.

187
00:09:37,864 --> 00:09:42,443
I watched by the kitchen window,
hoping that...

188
00:09:43,647 --> 00:09:45,389
You don't think George...

189
00:09:45,389 --> 00:09:48,534
We know he had a problem with Rush.

190
00:09:48,534 --> 00:09:52,762
George yelled a lot,
but I'm who he was mad at.

191
00:09:52,762 --> 00:09:57,613
I called Dr. Rush to apologize.
He's very understanding.

192
00:09:57,613 --> 00:09:59,938
Said he's been through a lot.

193
00:09:59,938 --> 00:10:02,622
Especially with his son.

194
00:10:03,019 --> 00:10:04,814
What about his son?

195
00:10:04,814 --> 00:10:08,231
Kids. It's just not easy.

196
00:10:08,231 --> 00:10:12,027
Excuse me. Emma. Emma.

197
00:10:13,381 --> 00:10:16,096
I've called three times
for the DNA results.

198
00:10:16,096 --> 00:10:18,766
I mean, I thought Major Case had pull.

199
00:10:18,766 --> 00:10:21,675
Rogers tells me it was five calls,
not three.

200
00:10:21,675 --> 00:10:23,611
And she explained the lab needed time

201
00:10:23,611 --> 00:10:26,051
because the crime scene was
contaminated by a blood relative.

202
00:10:26,051 --> 00:10:29,598
So you always make excuses
for the people you work with?

203
00:10:29,598 --> 00:10:32,957
Detective, it's okay to have the thought.
You don't always have to say it.

204
00:10:32,957 --> 00:10:34,363
Moving on...

205
00:10:34,363 --> 00:10:37,551
about Rush's son Jason.

206
00:10:37,551 --> 00:10:39,460
Impulse control issues.

207
00:10:39,460 --> 00:10:44,819
He was expelled once for cheating,
once for bullying. / Appreciate that.

208
00:10:44,819 --> 00:10:47,795
That was an old drinking buddy of mine
down at the two-one.

209
00:10:47,795 --> 00:10:50,330
Says they got called
to the Rushes' apartment

210
00:10:50,330 --> 00:10:53,294
about six months ago
on a domestic dispute.

211
00:10:53,294 --> 00:10:57,447
Apparently, the father and son
were going at it during a passover seder.

212
00:10:57,447 --> 00:11:00,335
Guess we know
who didn't find the afikomen.

213
00:11:02,879 --> 00:11:05,890
It's like an easter egg hunt with a matzo.

214
00:11:05,890 --> 00:11:07,194
Anyway, pay a call.

215
00:11:07,194 --> 00:11:10,390
See if the boy and his father
ever buried the hatchet.

216
00:11:10,667 --> 00:11:13,591
Logan, you got a sec?

217
00:11:18,948 --> 00:11:21,668
How are things working out
with you two?

218
00:11:21,949 --> 00:11:23,721
Working.

219
00:11:24,163 --> 00:11:29,121
Falacci's not really a people person.

220
00:11:29,121 --> 00:11:30,701
Yeah.

221
00:11:30,701 --> 00:11:32,705
But she's a closer.

222
00:11:32,705 --> 00:11:37,504
Besides, I wanna take a shot
at being the diplomat for once.

223
00:11:39,431 --> 00:11:41,837
What was that all about?

224
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:43,594
You.

225
00:11:43,594 --> 00:11:47,397
Did he say I'm not a people person?

226
00:11:47,911 --> 00:11:49,784
I'd let it go.

227
00:11:54,708 --> 00:11:57,606
Jason revered his father.
He's straightening up.

228
00:11:57,606 --> 00:12:00,751
In fact, he's going to Appleton this fall.

229
00:12:00,751 --> 00:12:04,116
Hate to tell you, but we just locked up
one of their finest for murder last year.


230
00:12:04,116 --> 00:12:06,154
Hear that, mom?

231
00:12:06,154 --> 00:12:09,567
That's where you're sending me
to straighten up.

232
00:12:10,254 --> 00:12:13,592
Jason. That's funny. Your mom said
you weren't home.

233
00:12:13,592 --> 00:12:17,920
So, um, where were you
the night your father was murdered?

234
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:19,783
Chillin' with friends by the bandshell.

235
00:12:19,783 --> 00:12:21,294
Well, we're gonna want to talk to them.

236
00:12:21,294 --> 00:12:25,048
Good luck, they were getting tweaked
on Vicodin and coke.

237
00:12:25,048 --> 00:12:26,688
And what were you, a chaperone?

238
00:12:26,688 --> 00:12:28,993
I was wasted.

239
00:12:28,993 --> 00:12:31,999
At least I'm being honest about it.

240
00:12:31,999 --> 00:12:34,693
Hey, I'm all about peace.

241
00:12:34,693 --> 00:12:36,574
Well, if you're so peaceful,

242
00:12:36,574 --> 00:12:40,520
why did you threaten
your father on passover?

243
00:12:45,007 --> 00:12:46,558
Stand up.

244
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:48,581
Stand up.

245
00:12:48,885 --> 00:12:51,110
Let me see your hands.

246
00:12:53,229 --> 00:12:55,057
Where'd you get these nicks?

247
00:12:55,057 --> 00:12:57,227
Cutting coke.

248
00:12:58,865 --> 00:13:01,592
Anything else you wanna see, fire crotch?

249
00:13:01,592 --> 00:13:03,069
That's it, I'm taking this little prick in.

250
00:13:03,069 --> 00:13:05,415
No need, Logan.
We got his DNA right here.

251
00:13:05,415 --> 00:13:06,319
You can't take that.

252
00:13:06,319 --> 00:13:10,981
Well, it's either him or the shirt.
Your choice.

253
00:13:20,385 --> 00:13:23,553
If the lab ever gets back to us,
we might have a match.

254
00:13:23,553 --> 00:13:26,505
I mean, this kid's three stages
from sociopath.

255
00:13:26,505 --> 00:13:28,095
If you say so.

256
00:13:28,095 --> 00:13:31,580
For now, he admits to being in the park
with his friends doing drugs.

257
00:13:31,580 --> 00:13:33,753
What, you think that's an alibi?

258
00:13:33,753 --> 00:13:35,813
How 'bout a habit?

259
00:13:35,813 --> 00:13:38,327
Right. So if he was in his dad's office,

260
00:13:38,327 --> 00:13:41,482
why leave the drugs
and prescription pads?

261
00:13:42,314 --> 00:13:47,288
I was more interested when he said,
"at least I was being honest."

262
00:13:47,288 --> 00:13:50,714
He was looking at his mother
right in the eye when he said that.

263
00:13:50,714 --> 00:13:53,749
So he could just be
acting like a teenager.

264
00:13:53,749 --> 00:13:56,506
Or she could be hiding something.

265
00:13:57,508 --> 00:14:01,532
Falacci, does that mean
that you just agreed with me?

266
00:14:01,532 --> 00:14:03,513
- Keys.
- It's my turn to drive.

267
00:14:03,513 --> 00:14:06,229
Oh, come on, Logan.
I wanna get there.

268
00:14:08,540 --> 00:14:10,185
Nice catch.

269
00:14:13,496 --> 00:14:15,348
Well, Jason was right about one thing.

270
00:14:15,348 --> 00:14:17,125
He was being more honest
than his mother.

271
00:14:17,125 --> 00:14:18,561
What have you got?

272
00:14:18,561 --> 00:14:22,905
Paula Rush signed up for a family plan
with one cell phone carrier last year.

273
00:14:22,905 --> 00:14:26,926
But then she set up an individual plan
just for herself with a different carrier.

274
00:14:26,926 --> 00:14:28,831
She only calls one number on that line.

275
00:14:28,831 --> 00:14:30,174
A no-name cell.

276
00:14:30,174 --> 00:14:32,453
One other possible tell
she's up to something.

277
00:14:32,453 --> 00:14:34,243
Here's her credit card statement.

278
00:14:34,243 --> 00:14:36,407
She joined a new gym last year.

279
00:14:36,407 --> 00:14:39,879
Two sessions a week
with a personal trainer.

280
00:14:40,630 --> 00:14:45,322
I already told you, my son had nothing
to do with Zach's murder.

281
00:14:45,322 --> 00:14:48,031
His friends confirmed
he was partying in the park.

282
00:14:48,031 --> 00:14:50,412
So what time did he get home?

283
00:14:50,412 --> 00:14:51,718
Early. 8:30.

284
00:14:51,718 --> 00:14:54,015
You seem very sure about that.

285
00:14:54,015 --> 00:14:56,363
We came home within minutes
of each other.

286
00:14:56,363 --> 00:14:59,887
I had just come back from the gym.
I was with my trainer, Ted.

287
00:14:59,887 --> 00:15:03,201
Oh, we can call the gym,
find out if you were there.

288
00:15:03,201 --> 00:15:05,527
What are you people saying?

289
00:15:05,833 --> 00:15:08,957
I was devoted to my husband.

290
00:15:09,169 --> 00:15:14,518
Well, uh, if you were so devoted,

291
00:15:14,518 --> 00:15:17,602
why do you have a private cell phone?

292
00:15:18,262 --> 00:15:19,855
Excuse me?

293
00:15:19,855 --> 00:15:23,203
So you just have the one number?

294
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:27,149
The one I just dialed you on.

295
00:15:31,692 --> 00:15:36,165
- That's right.
- We must have made a mistake.

296
00:15:43,097 --> 00:15:45,496
Do you want to answer that?

297
00:15:50,587 --> 00:15:55,467
So Paula, you wanna
save your son, right?

298
00:15:55,789 --> 00:15:57,888
Well, you can start
by being honest with us.

299
00:15:57,888 --> 00:16:00,592
Who were you having the affair with?

300
00:16:05,065 --> 00:16:09,300
I was having a close
relationship with someone.

301
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:12,627
But I don't think...
I'm sure he has nothing to do with this.

302
00:16:12,627 --> 00:16:15,993
We don't care what you think.

303
00:16:15,993 --> 00:16:18,347
Who is he?

304
00:16:18,347 --> 00:16:21,301
My brother-in-law, Eli.

305
00:16:22,197 --> 00:16:25,847
And your husband knew
about this affair?

306
00:16:25,847 --> 00:16:27,551
No.

307
00:16:27,551 --> 00:16:29,347
In fact, it was over.

308
00:16:29,347 --> 00:16:31,359
Over when?

309
00:16:31,359 --> 00:16:32,986
Monday night.

310
00:16:32,986 --> 00:16:36,180
I met Eli for drinks,
and I broke it off.

311
00:16:36,180 --> 00:16:40,112
For my son's sake.
He suspected something,

312
00:16:40,112 --> 00:16:42,766
and he was starting to act out.

313
00:16:53,852 --> 00:16:55,491
Looking for me?

314
00:16:55,859 --> 00:16:57,672
You okay?
They called. I thought...

315
00:16:57,672 --> 00:17:01,377
I'm fine.
Just needed an oil change.

316
00:17:10,193 --> 00:17:12,021
Yes, I was sleeping with Paula.

317
00:17:12,021 --> 00:17:14,757
And if I heard that about anyone else,
I'd be appalled.

318
00:17:14,757 --> 00:17:17,266
But like the man said,
the heart wants what it wants.

319
00:17:17,266 --> 00:17:20,636
You can just have the thought, doctor.

320
00:17:20,636 --> 00:17:22,298
Did your brother know about the affair?

321
00:17:22,298 --> 00:17:24,809
No, I'd never hurt him like that.

322
00:17:24,809 --> 00:17:26,395
Neither of us wanted this to happen.

323
00:17:26,395 --> 00:17:28,664
We drew close because Paula
was having a problem with Jason.

324
00:17:28,664 --> 00:17:30,425
- Zach couldn't handle him.
- And you could?

325
00:17:30,425 --> 00:17:31,736
Do you have children?

326
00:17:31,736 --> 00:17:34,789
No, I can't actually.
It's the sadness of my life.

327
00:17:34,789 --> 00:17:38,351
But at least I'm able
to bring that joy to other people.

328
00:17:38,351 --> 00:17:40,657
Let's get back to your time line.

329
00:17:40,657 --> 00:17:41,517
Time line?

330
00:17:41,517 --> 00:17:44,789
Yeah, the night your brother was getting
his head bashed in.

331
00:17:44,789 --> 00:17:48,157
You went for that drink with his wife
at 7:30 until...

332
00:17:48,157 --> 00:17:52,212
8:15. And no, I didn't go back
to the office until 3:00 A.M.

333
00:17:52,212 --> 00:17:55,178
So it's just a coincidence
that an hour after his wife dumps you,

334
00:17:55,178 --> 00:17:58,256
- your brother ends up dead?
- Dumped me?

335
00:17:58,256 --> 00:18:00,004
I broke it off with Paula.

336
00:18:00,004 --> 00:18:02,011
Really? Any reason?

337
00:18:02,011 --> 00:18:04,957
Yeah, Kiki. That's who I spent
the rest of the evening with.

338
00:18:04,957 --> 00:18:07,088
And the restaurant can confirm that.

339
00:18:07,088 --> 00:18:09,985
Kiki doesn't need to know about Paula.

340
00:18:13,289 --> 00:18:16,942
I thought he was standing me up.
He was so late.

341
00:18:16,942 --> 00:18:18,717
What time did he finally get there, Kiki?

342
00:18:18,717 --> 00:18:21,617
Close to 9:30.
I was like, phh.

343
00:18:21,617 --> 00:18:24,225
They almost gave our table away.

344
00:18:24,225 --> 00:18:25,950
Did he say where he had been?

345
00:18:25,950 --> 00:18:29,520
Yeah, at the hospital, delivering triplets.

346
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:33,551
So did he seem a little...
upset or tense to you?

347
00:18:33,551 --> 00:18:36,029
No. We talked about work.

348
00:18:36,029 --> 00:18:38,330
You mean he talked about his work.

349
00:18:38,330 --> 00:18:43,076
Yes, he loves it.
The joy that he brings to families.

350
00:18:43,076 --> 00:18:49,017
Did he say anything to you about
the sadness of his life?

351
00:18:49,774 --> 00:18:53,101
How he can't have children?

352
00:18:53,101 --> 00:18:55,569
How did you know that?

353
00:18:56,004 --> 00:18:58,407
He's a dog.
It doesn't mean he's a killer.

354
00:18:58,407 --> 00:19:02,837
Eli left Paula at 8:15.
He kept Kiki waiting until 9:30.

355
00:19:02,837 --> 00:19:05,732
That hour would be
when he was delivering the triplets.

356
00:19:05,732 --> 00:19:06,983
Not according to the hospital.

357
00:19:06,983 --> 00:19:08,726
No triplets delivered the whole week.

358
00:19:08,726 --> 00:19:12,162
Well, maybe it was simple
as him trying to impress his date.

359
00:19:12,162 --> 00:19:14,912
The bar where he met Paula
was right by his office.

360
00:19:14,912 --> 00:19:18,170
So an hour to kill his brother,
truss him up,

361
00:19:18,170 --> 00:19:19,407
and then to get through his dinner.

362
00:19:19,407 --> 00:19:20,721
If he's moving fast, sure.

363
00:19:20,721 --> 00:19:23,341
What's your theory?
His brother confronted him about the affair,

364
00:19:23,341 --> 00:19:25,682
they argued, Eli killed him?

365
00:19:25,682 --> 00:19:29,028
Well, Zach Rush was killed
using a cube full of family photos.

366
00:19:29,028 --> 00:19:30,683
Interesting metaphor.

367
00:19:30,683 --> 00:19:34,421
Was it a metaphor
or a symbol, Falacci?

368
00:19:34,421 --> 00:19:38,852
Guess I'd have to take your homicide
investigation course to find out.

369
00:19:40,605 --> 00:19:42,587
The lab sorted it out.

370
00:19:42,587 --> 00:19:46,400
There was blood from three separate
individuals at the Rush crime scene.

371
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:48,777
So what was the holdup?

372
00:19:49,023 --> 00:19:51,420
The holdup, Falacci,

373
00:19:51,420 --> 00:19:55,977
is that it's a complicated case,
and the lab wanted to get it right.

374
00:19:56,163 --> 00:20:00,739
All right, the first sample
is from your victim, Zach Rush.

375
00:20:00,739 --> 00:20:02,852
The second sample
from the exam room.

376
00:20:02,852 --> 00:20:06,157
It matches the DNA you were given
by the victim's brother, Eli Rush.

377
00:20:06,157 --> 00:20:08,951
Yeah, well, there's
no surprise there either.

378
00:20:08,951 --> 00:20:11,502
He made a point of telling us
that he contaminated the crime scene.

379
00:20:11,502 --> 00:20:13,861
So this is complicated because?

380
00:20:13,861 --> 00:20:15,544
Falacci.

381
00:20:15,544 --> 00:20:17,623
The third sample,

382
00:20:17,623 --> 00:20:21,779
which was taken from the underside
of the bleached carpet swatch,

383
00:20:21,779 --> 00:20:24,035
it's a third blood relative.

384
00:20:24,035 --> 00:20:25,938
Direct relative?

385
00:20:27,757 --> 00:20:29,170
Zach's son Jason.

386
00:20:29,170 --> 00:20:33,226
Our first guess, but we ruled him out
when we ran the DNA from his t-shirt.

387
00:20:33,226 --> 00:20:34,734
Did Zach Rush have another son?

388
00:20:34,734 --> 00:20:36,329
No, it's not Zach Rush's son.

389
00:20:36,329 --> 00:20:39,978
It's the son of this man,
the victim's brother.

390
00:20:39,978 --> 00:20:42,309
Eli Rush.

391
00:20:42,309 --> 00:20:45,317
Are you sure?
He told us he couldn't have children.

392
00:20:45,317 --> 00:20:46,894
Falacci, two things we know...

393
00:20:46,894 --> 00:20:50,556
DNA doesn't lie and Eli Rush does.

394
00:20:58,130 --> 00:21:00,761
You told us you were sterile, Dr. Rush.

395
00:21:00,761 --> 00:21:03,346
I am.
I have been my whole life.

396
00:21:04,259 --> 00:21:07,608
That's your son's DNA, doctor.

397
00:21:07,608 --> 00:21:09,532
You're looking right at it.

398
00:21:09,532 --> 00:21:12,871
Oh, I work with labs all the time.
They make mistakes.

399
00:21:12,871 --> 00:21:15,084
This is probably my nephew
Jason's DNA.

400
00:21:15,084 --> 00:21:17,766
Yeah, Jason gave me
a sample of his DNA.

401
00:21:17,766 --> 00:21:20,070
It doesn't match this.

402
00:21:20,269 --> 00:21:21,691
Doc.

403
00:21:22,421 --> 00:21:26,380
Does it mean anything to you
that your brother's dead?

404
00:21:26,722 --> 00:21:28,748
First you tell me I killed my brother.

405
00:21:28,748 --> 00:21:30,808
Now you're telling me I have a son.

406
00:21:30,808 --> 00:21:32,746
I don't know how you managed
to screw this up so badly,

407
00:21:32,746 --> 00:21:36,353
but from now on,
you can talk to my lawyer.

408
00:21:39,639 --> 00:21:42,355
Why would he tell us he's sterile?

409
00:21:42,355 --> 00:21:44,926
Hey, he's an OB-GYN.

410
00:21:44,926 --> 00:21:47,698
He's not mistaken. He's lying.

411
00:21:47,698 --> 00:21:50,480
To protect his son
because the kid's the murderer?

412
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:52,815
Or to protect himself
because the kid's a witness?

413
00:21:52,815 --> 00:21:54,449
There's a third possibility.

414
00:21:54,449 --> 00:21:56,965
Maybe Eli doesn't know he has a son.

415
00:21:56,965 --> 00:21:58,404
You mean, like, a one night stand,

416
00:21:58,404 --> 00:22:00,641
or an ex who decided
to have the kid on her own?

417
00:22:00,641 --> 00:22:02,039
Those were my first guesses,

418
00:22:02,039 --> 00:22:04,127
but the doctor's never been
sued for child support.

419
00:22:04,127 --> 00:22:06,463
With a practice like his,
he'd be a prime target.

420
00:22:06,463 --> 00:22:07,893
Then it occurred to me,

421
00:22:07,893 --> 00:22:11,120
a lot of med students donate
to sperm banks.

422
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:14,999
Right. Doctors and ivy leaguers,
they get paid a premium.

423
00:22:15,489 --> 00:22:18,571
Here's a guy who claims he's sterile.

424
00:22:18,571 --> 00:22:20,618
They got a premium for blanks?

425
00:22:20,618 --> 00:22:23,380
Doctor Rush has an inability
to tell the truth.

426
00:22:23,380 --> 00:22:26,258
You need to look up some of
his old med school buddies.

427
00:22:26,258 --> 00:22:28,760
See if he's always had that condition.

428
00:22:30,385 --> 00:22:32,417
We were roommates for two years.

429
00:22:32,417 --> 00:22:35,800
But, uh, Rush was
a little too alpha for me.

430
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:37,183
Yeah, we get that.

431
00:22:37,183 --> 00:22:39,423
He made my wife uncomfortable too.

432
00:22:39,423 --> 00:22:41,649
Oh? See him around lately?

433
00:22:41,649 --> 00:22:43,046
Occasionally.

434
00:22:43,046 --> 00:22:45,200
The baby he delivered
becomes our patient.

435
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:49,290
But, uh, Eli doesn't do
a lot of follow-through.

436
00:22:49,290 --> 00:22:51,398
You mentioned that he made
your wife uncomfortable.

437
00:22:51,398 --> 00:22:53,076
Does that mean he hit on her?

438
00:22:53,076 --> 00:22:55,136
He hit on all beautiful women.

439
00:22:55,136 --> 00:22:57,868
But once he got them,
he was on to the next.

440
00:22:57,868 --> 00:23:01,723
Or maybe they left him
once they found out he was sterile?

441
00:23:01,723 --> 00:23:05,250
Sterile?
Is he still using that line?

442
00:23:05,250 --> 00:23:06,632
Apparently.

443
00:23:06,632 --> 00:23:08,456
He came up with that in med school.

444
00:23:08,456 --> 00:23:12,088
When a girl got too serious,
he'd mention his condition,

445
00:23:12,088 --> 00:23:14,377
and they'd move on without a scene.

446
00:23:14,377 --> 00:23:15,892
Smart cookie.

447
00:23:15,892 --> 00:23:17,668
Did he ever get anyone pregnant?

448
00:23:17,668 --> 00:23:19,182
No, he wore protection.

449
00:23:19,182 --> 00:23:21,661
He was paranoid about STDs.

450
00:23:21,661 --> 00:23:25,092
I could go on all day about Eli.
But what's this about?

451
00:23:25,092 --> 00:23:27,512
We're looking for his biological son.

452
00:23:27,512 --> 00:23:28,948
Good luck.

453
00:23:28,948 --> 00:23:31,873
Eli hit the sperm bank twice
a week back then.

454
00:23:31,873 --> 00:23:34,116
He bragged about his popularity.

455
00:23:34,116 --> 00:23:37,882
How do you become popular
at a sperm bank? It's anonymous.

456
00:23:37,882 --> 00:23:40,205
He really thinks he's god's gift.

457
00:23:40,205 --> 00:23:42,196
And his profile made him sound like it.

458
00:23:42,196 --> 00:23:47,395
He claimed he was a green-eyed
tennis star with perfect pitch,

459
00:23:47,395 --> 00:23:51,024
who played the oboe and
spoke Russian and Greek.

460
00:23:51,024 --> 00:23:54,274
You closed your eyes.
You have eidetic memory?

461
00:23:54,274 --> 00:23:57,450
Yeah. Also he had me write it for him.

462
00:23:57,450 --> 00:24:01,524
Good, 'cause we're gonna need you
to remember where that sperm bank was.

463
00:24:03,661 --> 00:24:04,795
There he is.

464
00:24:04,795 --> 00:24:07,989
Right down to the oboe.
Donor 305.

465
00:24:07,989 --> 00:24:10,818
Gives the month and year he was born,
but not the day.

466
00:24:10,818 --> 00:24:12,943
Doesn't mention red hair either.

467
00:24:12,943 --> 00:24:15,800
Yeah, you'd think that
would be a selling point.

468
00:24:17,002 --> 00:24:19,388
Logan, where's your ring?

469
00:24:19,946 --> 00:24:22,059
Don't worry, my dear.

470
00:24:22,059 --> 00:24:26,637
Everything is going to be fine.

471
00:24:29,486 --> 00:24:31,418
- Hi.
- Hello.

472
00:24:31,418 --> 00:24:33,553
We're interested in this profile, please.

473
00:24:33,553 --> 00:24:36,131
Okay. Number 305.

474
00:24:36,893 --> 00:24:40,305
Oh, I'm so sorry.
This should have been deleted by now.

475
00:24:40,305 --> 00:24:43,665
Well, he's the one we want.
We're both musicians.

476
00:24:43,665 --> 00:24:45,805
Well, I had a nice trumpet player
come in today.

477
00:24:45,805 --> 00:24:48,476
No, I'm Russian, and he's Greek.

478
00:24:48,476 --> 00:24:49,934
So this one's perfect.

479
00:24:49,934 --> 00:24:52,976
A lot of couples thought so.
That's why he's sold out.

480
00:24:52,976 --> 00:24:55,990
We read that sometimes people
buy more than they need.

481
00:24:55,990 --> 00:24:58,503
Any chance you could put us in touch
with anyone that's used him?

482
00:24:58,503 --> 00:25:01,520
Confidentiality is the core of what we do.

483
00:25:01,896 --> 00:25:04,341
Look, Miss Lee.

484
00:25:04,341 --> 00:25:06,429
This is a murder investigation.

485
00:25:06,429 --> 00:25:12,270
We need to be in contact with anyone
who was conceived using donor 305.

486
00:25:12,270 --> 00:25:14,299
Those records are closed.

487
00:25:14,299 --> 00:25:17,395
- We'll come back with a subpoena.
- It won't make a difference.

488
00:25:17,395 --> 00:25:19,254
The law's the law.

489
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:23,951
D.A.'s office says we can't get a subpoena
for sperm bank records.

490
00:25:23,951 --> 00:25:26,120
They've been through this a lot.

491
00:25:26,661 --> 00:25:29,301
Well, Rush could have
hundreds of kids out there.

492
00:25:29,301 --> 00:25:30,719
I mean, where do we even start?

493
00:25:30,719 --> 00:25:34,866
Same place donor kids would start
if they got shut down by the sperm bank.

494
00:25:34,866 --> 00:25:36,259
Go online.

495
00:25:36,259 --> 00:25:38,217
It's a natural instinct to want
to find your parents.

496
00:25:38,217 --> 00:25:41,760
There's gotta be websites, chat rooms.

497
00:25:43,243 --> 00:25:47,206
Logan, you ever want to have kids?

498
00:25:47,437 --> 00:25:50,878
You know when we'll be able
to tell that we're partners?

499
00:25:50,878 --> 00:25:54,773
When we don't have to ask
each other a lot of questions.

500
00:25:55,900 --> 00:25:58,414
Okay, here we go. Donorsibs.com

501
00:25:58,414 --> 00:26:01,559
A registry for children
conceived by sperm donors.

502
00:26:01,559 --> 00:26:07,710
They're comparing donor profiles,
searching for half-siblings.

503
00:26:07,710 --> 00:26:10,730
Ah, children of donor #305,

504
00:26:10,730 --> 00:26:13,263
and they'll have a standing date to play pool.

505
00:26:15,166 --> 00:26:17,486
We all made contact in different ways.

506
00:26:17,486 --> 00:26:19,963
Some of us knew which sperm bank
our mothers used.

507
00:26:19,963 --> 00:26:21,823
And what about the others?

508
00:26:21,823 --> 00:26:23,797
Well, it turns out we had a lot in common.

509
00:26:23,797 --> 00:26:27,567
We're all really good at languages.
Play an instrument.

510
00:26:27,918 --> 00:26:30,410
Do you have any idea
how many of you are out there?

511
00:26:30,410 --> 00:26:32,756
At least a dozen, from all over.

512
00:26:32,756 --> 00:26:35,878
We once heard from somebody
who moved to Nepal with his mother.

513
00:26:35,878 --> 00:26:37,303
Let me ask you something,

514
00:26:37,303 --> 00:26:39,098
How can you really be sure
that you're related?

515
00:26:39,098 --> 00:26:41,470
Do you send out your DNA
to be compared, or...

516
00:26:41,470 --> 00:26:43,577
Some people did. Not all.

517
00:26:43,577 --> 00:26:44,641
I did.

518
00:26:44,641 --> 00:26:46,950
There was this one guy
who was really into that.

519
00:26:46,950 --> 00:26:49,995
He wanted us to send a sample to a lab.

520
00:26:49,995 --> 00:26:52,104
- Who was that, Ben?
- Well, we never met him.

521
00:26:52,104 --> 00:26:54,607
But he got in touch with us
through donorsibs.

522
00:26:54,607 --> 00:26:57,230
Ben thinks he might have been our father.

523
00:26:57,911 --> 00:26:59,718
Who else would care that much?

524
00:26:59,718 --> 00:27:01,227
He asked us all these questions

525
00:27:01,227 --> 00:27:02,975
about who we were
and what our lives were like.

526
00:27:02,975 --> 00:27:05,836
- He asked a lot of medical questions.
- Medical questions?

527
00:27:05,836 --> 00:27:09,254
He wanted to know about our health.
Like he was a doctor.

528
00:27:09,254 --> 00:27:11,520
That's why I'm sure he was our father.

529
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:13,366
His profile said he was a med student.

530
00:27:13,366 --> 00:27:16,924
So this guy wanted you
to send in a DNA swab?

531
00:27:16,924 --> 00:27:19,584
Actually, he wanted a blood sample.

532
00:27:19,584 --> 00:27:23,397
He had access to a lab,
and said he could process it right away.

533
00:27:24,037 --> 00:27:26,169
See, he has to be our dad.

534
00:27:26,169 --> 00:27:28,568
Some day he's gonna
get in touch with us.

535
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:35,097
Do you have the address of that lab, Ben?

536
00:27:36,170 --> 00:27:39,577
So you... you can't make it?

537
00:27:40,886 --> 00:27:44,089
No, don't worry about it, man.

538
00:27:44,291 --> 00:27:46,720
I'll have another birthday next year.

539
00:27:48,914 --> 00:27:52,406
Yeah, I'm hanging in there.

540
00:27:52,807 --> 00:27:57,814
So just keep doing what you need to do,

541
00:27:57,814 --> 00:28:00,371
and I'll keep doing what I need to do.

542
00:28:00,940 --> 00:28:03,926
Okay. See ya.

543
00:28:14,065 --> 00:28:17,449
All six kids from the pool hall
volunteered DNA.

544
00:28:17,449 --> 00:28:18,747
They're all Eli's kids,

545
00:28:18,747 --> 00:28:21,686
but none matched the unknown blood
at the crime scene.

546
00:28:21,686 --> 00:28:23,370
So where does that leave us?

547
00:28:23,370 --> 00:28:26,207
The only leads we have at the moment
are these emails,

548
00:28:26,207 --> 00:28:29,257
which these kids want to believe
are from their father.

549
00:28:29,257 --> 00:28:31,197
- Any reason to think they are?
- None.

550
00:28:31,197 --> 00:28:34,238
This guy isn't interested in anything
beyond his own reflection.

551
00:28:34,238 --> 00:28:37,889
To some people, that's all children are...
mirror image.

552
00:28:37,889 --> 00:28:40,709
- But younger and without the baggage.
- Okay.

553
00:28:40,930 --> 00:28:44,459
Now, it turns out the emails aren't
from Eli's server anyway.

554
00:28:44,459 --> 00:28:46,146
They're from a bunch of
different IP addresses.

555
00:28:46,146 --> 00:28:48,889
- The sender kept moving around.
- Speaking of addresses,

556
00:28:48,889 --> 00:28:51,629
we get one yet for that lab
the kids were sending their DNA to?

557
00:28:51,629 --> 00:28:53,312
Mm-hmm. Deja vu.

558
00:28:53,312 --> 00:28:55,801
Turns out we've been there already.

559
00:28:56,009 --> 00:28:58,505
It's where Tom Pittino works.

560
00:28:59,502 --> 00:29:01,077
You ran blood tests on these kids?

561
00:29:01,077 --> 00:29:02,830
Yeah, I recognize a couple of the names.

562
00:29:02,830 --> 00:29:05,150
- Who asked you to do it?
- Tom Pittino.

563
00:29:05,150 --> 00:29:07,764
He was doing a research
project on DNA profiles.

564
00:29:07,764 --> 00:29:10,572
Tom Pittino.
Can you go get him?

565
00:29:10,572 --> 00:29:13,435
Sorry. He up and left about
an hour and a half ago.

566
00:29:13,435 --> 00:29:14,638
Didn't even wait for his paycheck.

567
00:29:14,638 --> 00:29:16,893
Do you have any idea
where he might have gone?

568
00:29:17,109 --> 00:29:18,974
No. But if you find him,

569
00:29:18,974 --> 00:29:23,188
tell him there's a lot of anxious people
waiting to talk to him about their DNA.

570
00:29:24,743 --> 00:29:28,530
Trouble is it's his DNA we're interested in.

571
00:29:29,194 --> 00:29:32,977
Tom Pittino spent how many years
in a quest for his sperm donor father?

572
00:29:32,977 --> 00:29:34,438
At least the last six.

573
00:29:34,438 --> 00:29:36,829
Here's Tom's freshman college I.D.

574
00:29:36,829 --> 00:29:39,974
Here's his I.D. for his first job
at an ancestry website.

575
00:29:39,974 --> 00:29:41,692
He had access to their database.

576
00:29:41,692 --> 00:29:43,760
He used that to start narrowing the field.

577
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:47,031
And next stop, Hudson school of
medicine, alumni office.

578
00:29:47,031 --> 00:29:49,149
Dr. Rush's alma mater.

579
00:29:49,149 --> 00:29:51,194
How did he figure that one out?

580
00:29:51,194 --> 00:29:53,702
His siblings knew their mother's cryobank.

581
00:29:53,702 --> 00:29:56,559
Hudson was one of the two
medical schools in the neighborhood.

582
00:29:56,559 --> 00:30:00,123
Last year, Tom gets his current job
at Metropolitan Genetics.

583
00:30:00,123 --> 00:30:03,906
By now, he'd zeroed in
on a handful of potential donors.

584
00:30:03,906 --> 00:30:07,349
We figure he probably stalked them
to get their DNA off

585
00:30:07,349 --> 00:30:09,714
a piece of gum, maybe a coffee cup.

586
00:30:09,714 --> 00:30:12,703
Once he IDed Rush as his genetic father,

587
00:30:12,703 --> 00:30:15,417
he had himself assigned
to Rush as a counselor.

588
00:30:15,417 --> 00:30:18,825
Say Pittino did finally
track down his biological father.

589
00:30:18,825 --> 00:30:21,201
How does his biological
uncle end up dead?

590
00:30:21,201 --> 00:30:22,485
That's what we wanna know too.

591
00:30:22,485 --> 00:30:25,851
We have teams staking out
Metropolitan Genetics and his apartment.

592
00:30:25,851 --> 00:30:27,326
How 'bout his mother's apartment?

593
00:30:27,326 --> 00:30:31,073
His mother died in '99 of leukemia.

594
00:30:31,073 --> 00:30:35,808
His father last appears
on his freshman financial aid form.

595
00:30:35,808 --> 00:30:39,136
John Lucas.
He runs a construction outfit.

596
00:30:39,136 --> 00:30:42,461
This kid was able to track down
his anonymous donor father.

597
00:30:42,461 --> 00:30:45,109
You ought to be able
to track down Lucas.

598
00:30:47,023 --> 00:30:48,950
Tom grew up thinking
I was his real father.

599
00:30:48,950 --> 00:30:52,411
I didn't tell him the truth
till he hit me up for college money.

600
00:30:52,411 --> 00:30:53,881
Why wait so long?

601
00:30:53,881 --> 00:30:56,690
His mother didn't want him and his brother
to know they were baster babies.

602
00:30:56,690 --> 00:30:59,418
Baster babies?
You raised them as your own.

603
00:30:59,418 --> 00:31:02,504
Yeah, but Tom and I never bonded.

604
00:31:02,504 --> 00:31:05,341
I think he was relieved
to find out he wasn't mine.

605
00:31:05,341 --> 00:31:08,117
I take it you two have not been in touch.

606
00:31:08,117 --> 00:31:10,394
No, last time he called was
about three years ago.

607
00:31:10,394 --> 00:31:11,870
Another favor.

608
00:31:11,870 --> 00:31:13,517
This time he says his little brother's sick.

609
00:31:13,517 --> 00:31:16,746
He needs medical information
about their genetic father.

610
00:31:16,746 --> 00:31:18,806
I told him what little I remembered.

611
00:31:18,806 --> 00:31:21,287
And that's all the help you gave him?

612
00:31:21,287 --> 00:31:24,192
Hey, I got two of my own
to worry about now.

613
00:31:24,192 --> 00:31:26,405
They fixed the problem
with my delivery pipeline.

614
00:31:26,405 --> 00:31:28,699
All right, so you haven't
talked to Tom since?

615
00:31:28,699 --> 00:31:30,165
No.

616
00:31:30,517 --> 00:31:32,507
Hey, what about the younger brother?

617
00:31:32,507 --> 00:31:33,976
Ralph?

618
00:31:34,664 --> 00:31:38,752
Great kid.
I was sorry to hear he was sick.

619
00:31:38,752 --> 00:31:41,505
Last time I heard he was
in a hospital in Queens.

620
00:31:41,505 --> 00:31:43,558
I sent him a card.

621
00:31:46,109 --> 00:31:48,050
Sensitive guy.

622
00:31:51,078 --> 00:31:53,645
Wiskott Aldrich syndrome.

623
00:31:53,645 --> 00:31:59,628
It's okay if you don't mind low platelet counts
and a leaky immune system.

624
00:31:59,829 --> 00:32:01,220
I'm dealing.

625
00:32:01,220 --> 00:32:06,254
Has your brother Tom told you
what he's been up to in his lab?

626
00:32:06,254 --> 00:32:09,366
I know he's working with a lot of doctors.

627
00:32:09,366 --> 00:32:11,402
Trying to get me better.

628
00:32:11,402 --> 00:32:12,791
Where is Tom?

629
00:32:12,791 --> 00:32:16,996
One of those doctors has been trying
to get in touch with him.

630
00:32:19,883 --> 00:32:21,437
I never know where he is.

631
00:32:21,437 --> 00:32:24,674
He's listed here as your next of kin.

632
00:32:25,475 --> 00:32:27,559
Small family.

633
00:32:29,028 --> 00:32:30,464
Listen, I'm getting kinda tired.

634
00:32:30,464 --> 00:32:33,700
Could you guys close the door
on your way out?

635
00:32:34,483 --> 00:32:36,631
Detectives, please, he's wiped out.

636
00:32:36,631 --> 00:32:38,320
Yeah, sure.

637
00:32:43,629 --> 00:32:46,644
Nurse, how sick is he?

638
00:32:46,644 --> 00:32:50,581
Without a bone marrow transplant,
maybe three months to live.

639
00:32:50,581 --> 00:32:53,363
It's a shame his brother isn't a match.

640
00:32:59,911 --> 00:33:02,229
A courier brought this.

641
00:33:03,155 --> 00:33:05,719
And those detectives
are still in the waiting room.

642
00:33:05,719 --> 00:33:07,774
- They're not leaving.
- I'm not talking to them.

643
00:33:07,774 --> 00:33:10,507
- Give them my lawyer's number.
- They seem pretty persistent.

644
00:33:10,507 --> 00:33:12,254
Get rid of them, Helen.

645
00:33:12,254 --> 00:33:14,148
Yes, Dr. Rush.

646
00:33:14,148 --> 00:33:15,853
You want the sample brought
into the other room?

647
00:33:15,853 --> 00:33:18,389
Don't worry about it.
I'll take care of it.

648
00:33:43,138 --> 00:33:45,615
I'm sorry. The doctor must
have gone out the back.

649
00:33:45,615 --> 00:33:47,473
He was due in surgery.

650
00:33:47,473 --> 00:33:49,771
Here's his attorney's number.

651
00:33:55,015 --> 00:33:56,264
You want this?

652
00:33:56,264 --> 00:34:02,375
Logan, you notice anything unusual
about the way these babies look?

653
00:34:02,375 --> 00:34:05,185
Don't all babies look the same, Falacci?

654
00:34:05,185 --> 00:34:08,409
There were 300 people
in my high school graduating class,

655
00:34:08,409 --> 00:34:11,047
maybe nine other redheads.

656
00:34:11,047 --> 00:34:16,427
I count that many in just 65 pictures
here on this wall.

657
00:34:39,831 --> 00:34:43,992
Eli Rush impregnated dozens of
patients with his own sperm.

658
00:34:43,992 --> 00:34:44,913
Why?

659
00:34:44,913 --> 00:34:48,096
He's a raging egomaniac
with a god complex.

660
00:34:48,096 --> 00:34:50,378
Okay. And Tom Pittino?

661
00:34:50,378 --> 00:34:54,032
We think Tom took the job
so that he could bond with Eli.

662
00:34:54,032 --> 00:34:56,103
In order to get Eli to donate bone marrow.

663
00:34:56,103 --> 00:34:57,541
While Tom's working there,

664
00:34:57,541 --> 00:35:00,115
he starts to notice that a lot of the babies
born into the practice

665
00:35:00,115 --> 00:35:02,375
share Eli's DNA profile.

666
00:35:02,375 --> 00:35:04,354
And did he try to use this as leverage?

667
00:35:04,354 --> 00:35:06,478
Well, if he did it didn't work.

668
00:35:06,478 --> 00:35:10,490
Ralph's still sick.
And Eli, he couldn't care less.

669
00:35:10,490 --> 00:35:12,880
So Eli turned Tom down.

670
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:15,318
And somehow Zach Rush turned up dead?

671
00:35:15,318 --> 00:35:17,025
Well, here's what we're thinking.

672
00:35:17,025 --> 00:35:19,333
Tom visits uncle Zach, right?

673
00:35:19,333 --> 00:35:21,953
So he outs Eli,
hoping that Zach's gonna help.

674
00:35:21,953 --> 00:35:25,389
Zach confronts Eli.
Eli's a total narcissist.

675
00:35:25,389 --> 00:35:28,634
He'd kill his own brother
to save his reputation.

676
00:35:29,902 --> 00:35:32,218
- Tom's still AWOL?
- Yeah.

677
00:35:32,218 --> 00:35:34,481
We're gonna need him to shake Eli.

678
00:35:34,481 --> 00:35:36,513
Call Ralph, tell him
his brother's in trouble,

679
00:35:36,513 --> 00:35:39,105
have him set up a family reunion.

680
00:35:39,105 --> 00:35:40,541
Got it.

681
00:35:43,468 --> 00:35:46,831
Dad, you've never even seen me.

682
00:35:48,039 --> 00:35:49,736
Don't you have anything
you want to say?

683
00:35:49,736 --> 00:35:52,510
You said your brother wanted to talk to me
or he was going to the police.

684
00:35:52,510 --> 00:35:54,624
Now where is he?

685
00:35:55,699 --> 00:35:58,230
Can I at least have a glass of water?

686
00:36:03,128 --> 00:36:04,474
Hey, Ralph.

687
00:36:04,474 --> 00:36:07,471
- Eli.
- It's about time you got here.

688
00:36:08,475 --> 00:36:10,631
What the hell is he doing here?

689
00:36:11,602 --> 00:36:12,743
Wasn't this your idea?

690
00:36:12,743 --> 00:36:14,877
Actually, it was ours, doc.

691
00:36:14,877 --> 00:36:18,383
So I take it you've met your two sons.

692
00:36:19,180 --> 00:36:20,897
All right.

693
00:36:20,897 --> 00:36:23,133
Yes, I was a donor.

694
00:36:23,133 --> 00:36:28,286
And Tom stalked me with the misguided notion
that I'd be a father to him.

695
00:36:29,522 --> 00:36:31,497
You have my lawyer's
phone number, detectives.

696
00:36:31,497 --> 00:36:33,375
Excuse me.
I have a baby to deliver.

697
00:36:33,375 --> 00:36:36,855
A baby. Congratulations.
Another son or this time a daughter?

698
00:36:36,855 --> 00:36:38,318
I don't know what you're talking about.

699
00:36:38,318 --> 00:36:40,957
Oh, well, see that's why we thought
this reunion might be helpful.

700
00:36:40,957 --> 00:36:42,031
But if you have to go,

701
00:36:42,031 --> 00:36:44,288
I'm sure Tom could probably
give us a lot of the answers we need.

702
00:36:44,288 --> 00:36:46,014
I don't follow either, detectives.

703
00:36:46,014 --> 00:36:47,180
Hey, Eli.

704
00:36:47,180 --> 00:36:50,663
We're on to your whole
Johnny appleseed routine, okay?


705
00:36:50,663 --> 00:36:53,141
Yeah, how many gingers
do you have out there anyway?

706
00:36:53,141 --> 00:36:54,661
Hundreds? Maybe a thousand?

707
00:36:54,661 --> 00:36:56,457
Whatever he told you, he's lying.

708
00:36:56,457 --> 00:36:58,753
Well, if he's lying it must be genetic.

709
00:36:58,753 --> 00:37:01,297
Not only were you gaving an affair
with your brother's wife.

710
00:37:01,297 --> 00:37:03,186
You also inseminated his patients.

711
00:37:03,186 --> 00:37:04,852
He confronted you.
You killed him.

712
00:37:04,852 --> 00:37:06,688
That's why your blood was
at the crime scene.

713
00:37:06,688 --> 00:37:09,648
No, you tell them the truth, Tom.

714
00:37:09,648 --> 00:37:10,870
He was angry.

715
00:37:10,870 --> 00:37:14,410
Because I wouldn't let them
dig out my bone marrow for a stranger.

716
00:37:14,410 --> 00:37:17,844
Then he tried to blackmail me
with a bunch of phony lab results.

717
00:37:17,844 --> 00:37:19,735
I had to throw him out of my office.

718
00:37:19,735 --> 00:37:22,484
And once everybody was gone,
he came back for Zach.

719
00:37:22,484 --> 00:37:24,037
After my brother's funeral,

720
00:37:24,037 --> 00:37:28,309
he said if I'd keep his secret,
he'd keep mine.

721
00:37:28,309 --> 00:37:30,283
Say something already.

722
00:37:30,500 --> 00:37:32,659
Okay, uh, Tom.

723
00:37:32,659 --> 00:37:34,913
Where were you when Zach was killed?

724
00:37:34,913 --> 00:37:36,422
He was here.

725
00:37:36,422 --> 00:37:38,749
With me, visiting.

726
00:37:39,269 --> 00:37:41,529
Go back inside, Ralph.

727
00:37:41,857 --> 00:37:43,743
Now see, here's the thing, Tom.

728
00:37:43,743 --> 00:37:46,910
We can arrest Eli for murder,
but is that what you really want?

729
00:37:46,910 --> 00:37:51,932
Is that why you spent the last three years
hunting him down?

730
00:37:52,387 --> 00:37:55,622
Yeah, when people need
something from each other,

731
00:37:55,622 --> 00:37:58,105
there's usually a way
of working things out.

732
00:37:58,105 --> 00:37:59,344
What is that supposed to mean?

733
00:37:59,344 --> 00:38:02,297
It means your son Ralph
needs a bone marrow transplant.

734
00:38:02,297 --> 00:38:05,062
He is not my son.

735
00:38:05,062 --> 00:38:06,140
No?

736
00:38:06,140 --> 00:38:09,445
You marrow is the only
perfect match I found.

737
00:38:09,445 --> 00:38:11,624
Forget him, Tom.

738
00:38:16,201 --> 00:38:18,858
If he donates, I'll talk.

739
00:38:18,858 --> 00:38:21,248
Are you all blackmailing me?

740
00:38:21,248 --> 00:38:23,684
What's it gonna be, Eli?

741
00:38:23,955 --> 00:38:25,761
You gonna do the right thing?

742
00:38:25,761 --> 00:38:27,374
Or are we gonna arrest you for murder?

743
00:38:27,374 --> 00:38:30,348
I don't owe them anything.
I gave them life.

744
00:38:30,348 --> 00:38:33,518
Doctor, this is your son.
Look at him.

745
00:38:33,518 --> 00:38:36,133
I am not doing this in front of him.

746
00:38:36,422 --> 00:38:38,915
Ralph, let me handle this.

747
00:38:56,851 --> 00:38:59,053
This disease, he got it from his mother.

748
00:38:59,053 --> 00:39:00,899
But you could save him.

749
00:39:00,899 --> 00:39:04,078
Do you know how much
a bone marrow surgery hurts?

750
00:39:04,078 --> 00:39:05,510
I've never been good with pain.

751
00:39:05,510 --> 00:39:08,096
One thing Ralph didn't get from you.

752
00:39:10,251 --> 00:39:12,568
Just give me the donation papers.
Let's get this over with.

753
00:39:12,568 --> 00:39:14,478
You tell them what they wanna know.

754
00:39:14,478 --> 00:39:16,293
I don't trust you.
So what if you sign?

755
00:39:16,293 --> 00:39:18,626
Tom, anything you tell us
is off the record.

756
00:39:18,626 --> 00:39:22,716
Eli is liable for murder
until Ralph gets the bone marrow.

757
00:39:27,213 --> 00:39:29,853
I used to just wonder
where I came from.

758
00:39:29,853 --> 00:39:33,210
I knew our father wasn't really our father.

759
00:39:33,210 --> 00:39:35,623
Then he abandoned us after mom died.

760
00:39:35,623 --> 00:39:37,436
So you started your hunt?

761
00:39:37,436 --> 00:39:40,674
It was just a fantasy
until Ralph got sick.

762
00:39:41,332 --> 00:39:43,434
I thought if I found my dad

763
00:39:43,434 --> 00:39:46,716
and he was a match,
he couldn't turn us down.

764
00:39:46,716 --> 00:39:49,248
His profile said he was
gonna be a doctor.

765
00:39:49,248 --> 00:39:51,226
What do you want?

766
00:39:51,226 --> 00:39:53,301
If I gave something to
every kid with my DNA,

767
00:39:53,301 --> 00:39:54,829
there'd be nothing left of me.

768
00:39:54,829 --> 00:39:56,096
All right, hold on.

769
00:39:56,096 --> 00:39:59,610
Tom, this is the part of
the equation I don't get.

770
00:39:59,610 --> 00:40:01,452
Why kill Zach?

771
00:40:01,452 --> 00:40:04,616
- Was he a match?
- No.

772
00:40:04,616 --> 00:40:06,889
I'd already checked.

773
00:40:09,688 --> 00:40:12,284
But after Eli turned me down,

774
00:40:12,284 --> 00:40:16,496
I went to Zach and I begged him
to talk to his brother.

775
00:40:17,913 --> 00:40:21,029
He said that he had been
cleaning up your messes his whole life

776
00:40:21,029 --> 00:40:22,676
and he couldn't get involved.

777
00:40:22,676 --> 00:40:24,616
We started to argue and he said

778
00:40:24,616 --> 00:40:28,917
that if I was looking for you to be a father,
that I should forget it.

779
00:40:28,917 --> 00:40:31,918
That I would never be a part of your family.

780
00:40:36,565 --> 00:40:38,849
I snapped.

781
00:40:41,262 --> 00:40:45,547
I didn't realize I'd grabbed the cube
until I saw it in my hand.

782
00:40:45,547 --> 00:40:47,688
Bloody.

783
00:40:50,764 --> 00:40:53,298
Crime of passion?

784
00:40:54,916 --> 00:40:57,988
Covered up the crime scene, huh?

785
00:40:58,278 --> 00:41:01,648
He was... he was bleeding pretty badly.
I panicked.

786
00:41:01,648 --> 00:41:04,065
So you dragged the body
to the exam room.

787
00:41:04,065 --> 00:41:05,997
You tied him up on the table,

788
00:41:05,997 --> 00:41:08,200
and tried to make it look like
a political statement?

789
00:41:08,200 --> 00:41:10,274
What? No.

790
00:41:10,554 --> 00:41:14,937
Zach was dead.
I ran out of there.

791
00:41:14,937 --> 00:41:18,037
I went home and I cried.

792
00:41:21,528 --> 00:41:24,719
I finally found what I'd been looking for.

793
00:41:25,081 --> 00:41:27,359
And it broke my heart.

794
00:41:30,997 --> 00:41:34,033
Oh, you can't believe him.
He's a killer.

795
00:41:35,544 --> 00:41:38,070
But you had too much to hide.

796
00:41:38,070 --> 00:41:40,452
The bleach on the blood stain.

797
00:41:40,452 --> 00:41:43,699
You didn't want us to find out
you had a son.

798
00:41:43,699 --> 00:41:45,651
Eli.

799
00:41:45,651 --> 00:41:48,449
You trussed up your own brother?

800
00:41:48,676 --> 00:41:52,555
He was dead.
I checked.

801
00:41:52,555 --> 00:41:55,158
So what if I restaged the scene?

802
00:41:55,158 --> 00:41:57,598
Tom's your murderer.
Arrest him.

803
00:41:57,598 --> 00:42:01,811
All right, just so you know,
everything is still off the record.

804
00:42:01,811 --> 00:42:03,420
Deal's a deal.

805
00:42:03,420 --> 00:42:05,662
Right, Tom?

806
00:42:06,756 --> 00:42:08,237
You have my word.

807
00:42:08,237 --> 00:42:10,648
You're not gonna make me do this.

808
00:42:10,648 --> 00:42:13,074
Well, we can't make you do it.

809
00:42:13,926 --> 00:42:17,828
But Eli, what can you do?

810
00:42:17,828 --> 00:42:19,867
It's family.

811
00:42:25,581 --> 00:42:30,853
