1
00:00:43,582 --> 00:00:47,854
Come on ladies, we're pushing pennies
around like a lot of old 'tards here.

2
00:00:48,202 --> 00:00:50,718
Let's see a real bet.

3
00:01:10,766 --> 00:01:12,092
Twice.

4
00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:14,147
- That's better.
- Fold.

5
00:01:17,974 --> 00:01:19,931
All in.

6
00:01:23,104 --> 00:01:25,437
Good morning mate.
Delivery for you.

7
00:01:25,641 --> 00:01:27,531
Fresh as you like.

8
00:01:30,367 --> 00:01:32,202
Bloody hell.

9
00:01:32,488 --> 00:01:34,292
What you plan on
doing with that?

10
00:01:34,432 --> 00:01:36,273
I'm gonna chop his head off.

11
00:01:36,414 --> 00:01:39,487
- You know I'm a vegetarian?!
- For Christ sake Tim!

12
00:01:39,884 --> 00:01:42,321
I'm not asking you
to fucking eat it.

13
00:01:42,671 --> 00:01:44,445
Only chop the head off.

14
00:01:44,573 --> 00:01:47,561
Ben, I can't mate.
Really, I can't.

15
00:01:48,942 --> 00:01:50,338
The head..

16
00:01:50,381 --> 00:01:51,910
Is mine.

17
00:01:53,336 --> 00:01:54,613
All right.

18
00:01:55,408 --> 00:01:57,173
Johnny's got the head.

19
00:01:57,552 --> 00:01:59,249
I've got the belly.

20
00:01:59,437 --> 00:02:00,723
Which leaves you

21
00:02:00,774 --> 00:02:01,908
the legs

22
00:02:02,017 --> 00:02:03,482
the gut

23
00:02:03,673 --> 00:02:05,374
or the fucking tale.

24
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,314
Where's the other fellow?

25
00:02:13,234 --> 00:02:14,814
You're late.

26
00:02:28,886 --> 00:02:30,995
Did I not make myself clear?!

27
00:02:31,232 --> 00:02:33,489
The other fellow, where is he?

28
00:02:33,626 --> 00:02:35,647
We can handle it!

29
00:02:35,906 --> 00:02:37,178
Guarantied!

30
00:02:37,413 --> 00:02:39,542
I need three of you inside.

31
00:02:40,004 --> 00:02:41,133
You've got three of us.

32
00:02:41,233 --> 00:02:44,033
You mean to tell me that tinker
bell here is gonna go inside?

33
00:02:44,162 --> 00:02:45,699
No.. Tinker..

34
00:02:46,796 --> 00:02:49,549
Tim.. will stay in the van.

35
00:02:49,696 --> 00:02:51,103
All right.

36
00:02:51,110 --> 00:02:53,047
So Tink takes the wheel

37
00:02:53,118 --> 00:02:55,790
whilst you and loud
ass there go inside?

38
00:02:55,857 --> 00:02:57,194
The two of you?

39
00:02:57,211 --> 00:02:59,857
- I trust him with my life.
- Yeah, well I don't.

40
00:03:00,034 --> 00:03:03,854
So you find someone else, otherwise,
the deal is of, all right?!

41
00:03:15,593 --> 00:03:17,487
All right.

42
00:03:19,633 --> 00:03:21,721
I'll find another guy.

43
00:03:22,399 --> 00:03:23,752
Okay?

44
00:03:24,723 --> 00:03:26,556
If..

45
00:03:26,743 --> 00:03:29,760
And I mean if this goes
according to plan..

46
00:03:30,975 --> 00:03:32,420
He's got a ring.

47
00:03:32,593 --> 00:03:33,882
You take it!

48
00:03:34,023 --> 00:03:36,432
The ring is very
important to him.

49
00:03:36,581 --> 00:03:39,226
You might say it's
his little friend.

50
00:03:39,985 --> 00:03:41,778
Adios.

51
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:48,361
Fucking tosser!

52
00:04:39,823 --> 00:04:42,881
- Hello?
<i>- Happy birthday to you</i>

53
00:04:42,975 --> 00:04:45,504
<i>happy birthday to you</i>

54
00:04:45,572 --> 00:04:48,628
<i>happy birthday dear Michael</i>

55
00:04:48,735 --> 00:04:50,960
<i>happy birthday to you.</i>

56
00:04:51,036 --> 00:04:52,147
Wow, I'm touched.

57
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:53,405
<i>Love you so much.</i>

58
00:04:53,482 --> 00:04:55,487
Sounds like I'll come in for
a very good night tonight?!

59
00:04:55,538 --> 00:04:57,651
<i>Oh yes, but it was
different in my dreams.</i>

60
00:04:57,686 --> 00:04:58,972
Why is that?

61
00:04:59,236 --> 00:05:01,520
You've been having those
dirty dreams about me again?

62
00:05:01,631 --> 00:05:04,047
<i>Hmm, but it happened in
a Polish restaurant.</i>

63
00:05:04,108 --> 00:05:05,837
- Oh shit.
<i>- Oh yes.</i>

64
00:05:06,030 --> 00:05:09,626
No, that's no good, cause since you've
met me, all your dreams have come true.

65
00:05:09,732 --> 00:05:11,161
<i>I know Michael. Look..</i>

66
00:05:11,420 --> 00:05:13,961
<i>I've ordered a table at
Gordon's, just the two of us.</i>

67
00:05:14,088 --> 00:05:15,758
<i>We have to be there in an hour.</i>

68
00:05:16,247 --> 00:05:17,387
An hour?

69
00:05:17,550 --> 00:05:18,439
<i>Yes.</i>

70
00:05:18,474 --> 00:05:19,979
Well, at least it's not Polish.

71
00:05:20,043 --> 00:05:22,264
<i>Definitely not. And I
have a surprise for you.</i>

72
00:05:22,339 --> 00:05:23,626
Yeah, you should do.

73
00:05:23,743 --> 00:05:25,864
Besides, I've got a little
surprise for you too.

74
00:05:26,043 --> 00:05:28,756
<i>Surprise?! I'm finally
going to meet the queen?</i>

75
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:30,092
Who told you?

76
00:05:30,224 --> 00:05:31,823
<i>Everybody's talking about it.</i>

77
00:05:33,017 --> 00:05:34,486
No, but..

78
00:05:35,009 --> 00:05:37,074
I do have a little..

79
00:05:37,201 --> 00:05:38,468
<i>Michael?</i>

80
00:05:39,371 --> 00:05:40,628
<i>Michael?</i>

81
00:05:40,782 --> 00:05:42,486
Now, there is a surprise.

82
00:05:42,507 --> 00:05:43,796
<i>What?</i>

83
00:05:44,098 --> 00:05:45,688
I'll be there in a jiffy.

84
00:05:45,773 --> 00:05:47,268
<i>Okay.</i>

85
00:05:55,739 --> 00:05:57,901
What the shitty fuck?!

86
00:05:59,153 --> 00:06:00,430
Let go of me!

87
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:02,024
What the fuck?!

88
00:06:02,198 --> 00:06:03,363
Take it off!

89
00:06:17,279 --> 00:06:19,297
Please, let go of me.

90
00:06:25,535 --> 00:06:26,535
Help?!

91
00:06:26,538 --> 00:06:28,128
I'll give you anything!

92
00:06:31,205 --> 00:06:32,858
You work for her Majesty?

93
00:06:32,869 --> 00:06:34,048
What's it got to do with you?

94
00:06:34,135 --> 00:06:37,109
You'd take a bullet in your
bullocks for queen and country?

95
00:06:37,191 --> 00:06:37,918
What?

96
00:06:37,923 --> 00:06:41,985
Even though the old deer makes you
work on your fucking birthday.

97
00:06:43,838 --> 00:06:44,992
Johnny, you fucker!

98
00:06:44,997 --> 00:06:46,099
Happy birthday mate.

99
00:06:46,140 --> 00:06:47,175
God save the Queen.

100
00:06:47,204 --> 00:06:48,442
Piss off Ben!

101
00:06:48,451 --> 00:06:49,656
Come on! Come on! Let me out!

102
00:06:49,745 --> 00:06:51,413
You scared the shit out of me.

103
00:06:51,517 --> 00:06:53,642
Here. Happy birthday fellow.

104
00:06:53,653 --> 00:06:55,999
Yeah, what were you doing
with that bunny rabbit, eh?

105
00:06:56,043 --> 00:06:57,245
That is Jess..

106
00:06:57,305 --> 00:06:58,914
Well it was just
Jessica's present.

107
00:06:59,011 --> 00:07:00,612
I was thinking about
you, the whole time.

108
00:07:00,615 --> 00:07:02,181
Oh, you pervert.

109
00:07:02,525 --> 00:07:04,435
- And you?
- Sorry Michael.

110
00:07:04,718 --> 00:07:07,038
We just wanted to give you
the best surprise ever.

111
00:07:07,069 --> 00:07:09,575
Oh why, well you
certainly did that Tim.

112
00:07:09,723 --> 00:07:10,925
No problem there!

113
00:07:11,104 --> 00:07:12,104
All right, let's go!

114
00:07:12,253 --> 00:07:13,818
- Go? Go where?
- Here.

115
00:07:14,717 --> 00:07:15,590
All right, what?!

116
00:07:15,617 --> 00:07:19,383
A wrank looking strip club. Even you're
not thick enough to think of going there.

117
00:07:19,417 --> 00:07:20,417
Oh yeah, we forgot.

118
00:07:20,447 --> 00:07:22,079
You're into cuddly
toys now, aren't you?

119
00:07:22,359 --> 00:07:24,007
I am not going in there!

120
00:07:24,037 --> 00:07:26,537
I don't care what you
say, I've had enough!

121
00:07:27,607 --> 00:07:28,477
Jessica.

122
00:07:28,528 --> 00:07:30,096
- Mickey?!
- No. I'm sorry, I've got to go.

123
00:07:30,101 --> 00:07:32,239
- Must see Jessie, she's waiting on me.
- Mickey, for fuck's sake.

124
00:07:32,311 --> 00:07:34,106
Will you just calm down?!
Mickey please?!

125
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:37,958
Look! I have to go and see Jessica,
all right?! She's waiting for me.

126
00:07:38,003 --> 00:07:40,293
All right. I see the
surprise is out the window.

127
00:07:40,377 --> 00:07:43,340
But we have to go and tell the girls.
Please, ten minutes?!

128
00:07:43,410 --> 00:07:45,273
No, thank you. It's
not my business!

129
00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:48,430
Come on mate please, for
fuck's sake, do us a favor.

130
00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:51,818
All right, five
minutes, all right?!

131
00:07:51,914 --> 00:07:53,508
And not a heartbeat more!

132
00:07:53,590 --> 00:07:55,934
Okay Mickey. Just
turn the van around.

133
00:07:55,996 --> 00:07:57,766
These girls might
take us by force.

134
00:07:57,866 --> 00:07:58,892
Hopefully.

135
00:08:00,464 --> 00:08:03,270
You sure are fucking cunts!

136
00:08:06,470 --> 00:08:08,281
Let me tell you what John.
He's gonna go

137
00:08:08,293 --> 00:08:10,293
apeshit when he finds out.
It's a fact mate.

138
00:08:10,296 --> 00:08:12,298
Fuck you and your facts Tim.
We stick to the plan!

139
00:08:12,310 --> 00:08:13,560
Here

140
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:29,986
We're closed.

141
00:08:29,991 --> 00:08:32,060
Closed or not mate, I
have to drop this off.

142
00:08:32,084 --> 00:08:33,564
You're not dropping
anything off mate.

143
00:08:33,594 --> 00:08:37,196
I told you, the bar is closed. So
fuck off and come back tomorrow!

144
00:08:37,384 --> 00:08:39,049
Shut it dickhead!

145
00:08:43,879 --> 00:08:45,969
You know the trouble with
the world right now Karl?

146
00:08:46,074 --> 00:08:47,677
Not enough trust.

147
00:08:47,727 --> 00:08:50,240
But I'm gonna trust these cards.

148
00:08:53,432 --> 00:08:55,922
When I said use your head,
I meant your own one.

149
00:08:55,954 --> 00:08:57,385
Fresh meat.

150
00:08:58,403 --> 00:08:59,625
What?

151
00:09:01,783 --> 00:09:03,797
Wait! Wait! Wait!
Don't you flinch!

152
00:09:03,855 --> 00:09:05,505
Put your hands on the table!

153
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:06,705
Where I can see them!

154
00:09:06,785 --> 00:09:08,297
What the fuck is going on here?

155
00:09:08,382 --> 00:09:09,837
Shut your mouth!

156
00:09:09,897 --> 00:09:11,902
Or I'll shut it for you!

157
00:09:12,019 --> 00:09:13,317
Open it up! Come on!

158
00:09:15,103 --> 00:09:17,445
I think you pricks are
a little confused.

159
00:09:17,569 --> 00:09:20,427
Slowly, don't you make me
fucking nervous. Come on!

160
00:09:20,433 --> 00:09:23,415
Do you have any idea who
owns this establishment?

161
00:09:23,550 --> 00:09:24,843
Who sent you?

162
00:09:24,899 --> 00:09:26,397
The international

163
00:09:26,474 --> 00:09:28,321
red fucking cross!

164
00:09:32,187 --> 00:09:34,745
Let's gather the harvest.

165
00:09:34,803 --> 00:09:36,017
Come on gentlemen!

166
00:09:37,283 --> 00:09:38,433
Come on!

167
00:09:40,901 --> 00:09:42,782
Faster gentlemen! Faster!

168
00:09:50,201 --> 00:09:51,435
I said..

169
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:53,575
Five minutes!

170
00:10:07,481 --> 00:10:08,703
Fuck!

171
00:10:13,341 --> 00:10:16,179
Come on! Faster, you
fucking cripple!

172
00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:23,083
Aren't you forgetting something?

173
00:10:24,287 --> 00:10:25,321
Like what?

174
00:10:25,645 --> 00:10:27,239
Your ring!

175
00:10:37,397 --> 00:10:39,251
Are you deaf?!

176
00:10:39,413 --> 00:10:42,631
Put the ring on the
fucking table!

177
00:10:46,027 --> 00:10:47,237
Shoot!

178
00:10:47,785 --> 00:10:48,855
What?

179
00:10:49,092 --> 00:10:50,327
Shoot him!

180
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:53,195
No! Oh, no! I can't..

181
00:10:53,459 --> 00:10:54,485
I can't do it!

182
00:10:55,805 --> 00:10:57,360
Fuck! Shoot him!

183
00:10:57,539 --> 00:10:59,344
Motherfucker I'm telling you!

184
00:11:00,348 --> 00:11:01,147
I can't!

185
00:11:01,215 --> 00:11:03,125
Pour his fucking brains out!

186
00:11:03,359 --> 00:11:04,409
Now!

187
00:11:04,904 --> 00:11:05,727
I can't.

188
00:11:05,786 --> 00:11:07,525
You're such a fucking pussy!

189
00:11:12,257 --> 00:11:13,337
Oh fu..

190
00:11:20,534 --> 00:11:21,984
Get back!

191
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,650
I promise I'll aim
better next time.

192
00:11:27,717 --> 00:11:29,086
You're fucking mental!

193
00:11:29,296 --> 00:11:31,842
Really?! You're not
the first to notice.

194
00:11:47,020 --> 00:11:48,554
I'll find you!

195
00:11:48,628 --> 00:11:50,862
I'll fucking find you!
And when I do..

196
00:11:50,984 --> 00:11:53,430
I'll cut of your fucking balls..

197
00:11:53,615 --> 00:11:55,182
And when you fucking eat them..

198
00:11:55,290 --> 00:11:58,900
I'm gonna pull them out of your
fucking asshole with this hand!

199
00:11:58,924 --> 00:12:01,598
You fucking fat cunt!

200
00:12:01,688 --> 00:12:02,731
Oy?!

201
00:12:03,608 --> 00:12:05,361
Is this what you
were looking for?

202
00:12:09,312 --> 00:12:10,214
What?

203
00:12:10,263 --> 00:12:12,688
Don't play silly
puppets with me!

204
00:12:12,964 --> 00:12:15,770
You wanted your play with
his ring didn't you?

205
00:12:16,104 --> 00:12:17,338
Well, as it happens..

206
00:12:17,351 --> 00:12:19,410
I've grown quite fond of it.

207
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:21,338
I think I'll just adopt to it.

208
00:12:21,450 --> 00:12:22,450
I'll think of it

209
00:12:22,487 --> 00:12:23,776
as a present!

210
00:12:25,351 --> 00:12:26,874
Fucking knew.

211
00:12:27,762 --> 00:12:29,564
You fucking snake!

212
00:12:30,740 --> 00:12:32,278
Come on! Come on!

213
00:12:32,420 --> 00:12:34,149
Move! Move! Move! Now!

214
00:12:40,370 --> 00:12:41,921
Move! Fucking move!

215
00:12:42,588 --> 00:12:44,830
You come and investigate,
you're the police.

216
00:12:44,886 --> 00:12:46,149
I'll call you back.

217
00:12:46,382 --> 00:12:47,968
Mickey start the van!

218
00:12:47,985 --> 00:12:48,991
Wait, what happened?

219
00:12:49,093 --> 00:12:50,374
Drive! Just fucking drive!

220
00:12:50,434 --> 00:12:51,457
Now wait a minute.

221
00:12:51,507 --> 00:12:52,857
- Move!
- All right!

222
00:12:55,818 --> 00:12:57,412
Shittin' Jesus Christ.

223
00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:58,956
What was all that about?

224
00:12:58,980 --> 00:13:00,148
Nothing Mickey.

225
00:13:00,450 --> 00:13:01,748
- We're all good.
- Good?!

226
00:13:01,846 --> 00:13:04,676
How can it be good Johnny?
I heard a fucking gunshot!

227
00:13:04,754 --> 00:13:06,312
Need to clear your
ears out mate.

228
00:13:06,335 --> 00:13:07,597
Probably just been foy.

229
00:13:07,623 --> 00:13:08,650
Oh fuck off Ben!

230
00:13:08,901 --> 00:13:10,072
Calm down Mickey.

231
00:13:10,118 --> 00:13:11,156
Girls just..

232
00:13:11,562 --> 00:13:12,992
Got a bit upset, that's all.

233
00:13:13,087 --> 00:13:14,782
But we got you a present.

234
00:13:15,062 --> 00:13:16,752
Piss off with your presents!

235
00:13:16,896 --> 00:13:18,028
Are you sure about that?

236
00:13:18,078 --> 00:13:21,587
Don't think you want me fucking
around with your future.

237
00:13:22,538 --> 00:13:23,538
What is that?

238
00:13:23,588 --> 00:13:25,508
Problems with your
eyesight, lad?!

239
00:13:25,540 --> 00:13:26,702
Oh fuck! No!

240
00:13:26,797 --> 00:13:28,727
No! No! No! No! No!

241
00:13:39,973 --> 00:13:41,640
What did you do Johnny? Eh?

242
00:13:41,683 --> 00:13:43,781
What the fuck did you do?

243
00:13:46,061 --> 00:13:47,319
Set you up mate.

244
00:13:47,406 --> 00:13:49,543
Tell me you're just having
another laugh, all right?!

245
00:13:49,603 --> 00:13:53,131
Tell me that this is
just a fucking wind-up.

246
00:13:53,772 --> 00:13:55,014
Not really.

247
00:13:55,204 --> 00:13:57,054
I know you're pissed
off now mate.

248
00:13:57,095 --> 00:13:58,095
But please

249
00:13:58,192 --> 00:13:59,480
just try to calm down.

250
00:13:59,544 --> 00:14:01,239
You tell me to calm down

251
00:14:01,279 --> 00:14:02,860
just one more time

252
00:14:02,948 --> 00:14:04,215
I will fucking end you!

253
00:14:04,373 --> 00:14:07,427
Look at it, we always said
we were to start it new.

254
00:14:07,489 --> 00:14:09,579
Now we can. All of us.

255
00:14:10,074 --> 00:14:11,396
We're sorted.

256
00:14:11,496 --> 00:14:12,873
Whose money is that?

257
00:14:12,917 --> 00:14:14,457
Look at it as a long-term loan.

258
00:14:14,541 --> 00:14:16,231
With payment optional.

259
00:14:16,525 --> 00:14:18,127
Who saw you? you?

260
00:14:18,165 --> 00:14:20,127
As far as I'm aware, no one!

261
00:14:20,197 --> 00:14:21,409
You're in the clear mate.

262
00:14:21,473 --> 00:14:23,538
And by the time those
guys sort themselves out,

263
00:14:23,555 --> 00:14:24,595
we'll be long gone.

264
00:14:24,621 --> 00:14:25,692
Gone?!

265
00:14:25,855 --> 00:14:27,057
Gone where?

266
00:14:27,117 --> 00:14:28,611
Malaysia my friend.

267
00:14:28,955 --> 00:14:32,181
Sunshine. Paradise is
just around the corner.

268
00:14:34,091 --> 00:14:35,745
And we've got a place for you.

269
00:14:35,761 --> 00:14:37,115
If you're willing to join us.

270
00:14:37,155 --> 00:14:38,218
Shit!

271
00:14:38,451 --> 00:14:40,381
This is fucking real?!

272
00:14:40,802 --> 00:14:45,201
You really are all just the
sneakiest, fucking donk shit, right?!

273
00:14:45,799 --> 00:14:47,769
You're right Johnny,
you clever bastard.

274
00:14:47,815 --> 00:14:49,609
Nobody did see me.

275
00:14:49,728 --> 00:14:51,235
So I weren't there.

276
00:14:52,097 --> 00:14:53,702
Just so we're clear?!

277
00:14:54,027 --> 00:14:55,357
I didn't do anything!

278
00:14:55,798 --> 00:14:57,244
You don't know me.

279
00:14:57,601 --> 00:14:59,403
And I don't know you.

280
00:14:59,487 --> 00:15:01,037
Any of you!

281
00:15:01,097 --> 00:15:03,312
And if I ever see you again.

282
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:04,849
You're fucking dead!

283
00:15:04,893 --> 00:15:06,549
I'll kill ya'll!

284
00:15:09,128 --> 00:15:10,474
His name's John.

285
00:15:10,551 --> 00:15:12,177
I don't know his last name.

286
00:15:12,549 --> 00:15:14,571
That's all I know Paul, I swear.

287
00:15:15,113 --> 00:15:16,439
Believe me.

288
00:15:16,554 --> 00:15:18,673
I know I fucked up, I
fucked up big-time Paul.

289
00:15:18,745 --> 00:15:20,599
But give me a chance, yeah?

290
00:15:21,541 --> 00:15:23,411
And I'll get the fuckers myself.

291
00:15:23,763 --> 00:15:25,273
I promise.

292
00:15:25,454 --> 00:15:27,008
They'll pay.

293
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:29,066
Yeah, they'll pay.

294
00:15:29,202 --> 00:15:30,962
I'll get the fuckers
myself, and they'll pay.

295
00:15:30,993 --> 00:15:32,704
I promise you they'll pay, ok?

296
00:15:32,976 --> 00:15:34,718
I'll get them! I'll
get them Paul.

297
00:15:34,827 --> 00:15:35,922
Yeah? I'll get them..

298
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:36,935
Pst!

299
00:15:38,279 --> 00:15:39,805
(SHUT THE) Fuck up!

300
00:15:41,206 --> 00:15:42,485
(OR) I'll crush you!

301
00:15:46,735 --> 00:15:47,937
I believe you.

302
00:15:48,019 --> 00:15:49,289
Yeah?

303
00:15:51,281 --> 00:15:52,663
Everybody pays.

304
00:15:52,725 --> 00:15:53,955
Yeah.

305
00:16:07,336 --> 00:16:09,360
He was in the fucking van.

306
00:16:09,585 --> 00:16:11,655
He seems fucking familiar to me.

307
00:16:11,717 --> 00:16:12,583
How come?

308
00:16:12,675 --> 00:16:14,504
If that really is him then..

309
00:16:14,613 --> 00:16:17,299
Then we've just been fucked
by the honorary guard of her

310
00:16:17,325 --> 00:16:20,223
Majesty, Queen Elizabeth,
the fucking second.

311
00:16:20,713 --> 00:16:23,543
If we get this little
prick, we find the others.

312
00:16:23,968 --> 00:16:25,834
I want you to take
all of our boys

313
00:16:25,887 --> 00:16:27,913
find out where they fucking live

314
00:16:27,932 --> 00:16:29,465
where they drink

315
00:16:29,476 --> 00:16:32,298
and even if they're coming up
to the queen of fucking England

316
00:16:32,493 --> 00:16:34,994
I want them crown jewels.

317
00:17:02,833 --> 00:17:04,120
- Hello?
<i>- Where are you?</i>

318
00:17:04,442 --> 00:17:05,467
Oh, Jess.

319
00:17:05,529 --> 00:17:06,855
Yeah, I.. I'm sorry darling.

320
00:17:06,879 --> 00:17:09,198
<i>- I'm waiting.</i>
- Yeah, I'm on my way there now.

321
00:17:09,299 --> 00:17:11,351
<i>Are you ok? What's
the matter with you?</i>

322
00:17:11,533 --> 00:17:13,094
No no..

323
00:17:13,121 --> 00:17:14,719
No. Everything's honky..

324
00:17:14,825 --> 00:17:16,435
Everything's fine!

325
00:17:16,538 --> 00:17:17,666
Hurry up then.

326
00:17:17,717 --> 00:17:20,259
Yes, yes! I'll be there
in a minute, all right?!

327
00:17:29,427 --> 00:17:30,793
Oh fuck!

328
00:17:34,136 --> 00:17:35,575
- Oh shit!
- He's inside!

329
00:17:35,695 --> 00:17:36,959
Fuck!

330
00:17:48,527 --> 00:17:49,673
Shit.

331
00:17:51,199 --> 00:17:53,024
Fucker's got away.

332
00:18:33,413 --> 00:18:35,212
I need to go to the toilet.

333
00:18:35,341 --> 00:18:37,403
Tim, what the fuck
are you doing?!

334
00:18:37,964 --> 00:18:39,727
You don't know me!

335
00:18:40,253 --> 00:18:41,808
I'll be back in a sec.

336
00:18:41,951 --> 00:18:43,373
Excuse me.

337
00:19:11,543 --> 00:19:12,617
Jesus Christ!

338
00:19:12,709 --> 00:19:14,631
I promised ya'll I'd kill you!

339
00:19:14,753 --> 00:19:17,799
Michael, I'm sorry! I wanted
to tell you, honestly.

340
00:19:18,475 --> 00:19:19,985
Where is it?

341
00:19:20,095 --> 00:19:21,465
I'm sorry.

342
00:19:21,973 --> 00:19:23,159
Where is it?

343
00:19:23,254 --> 00:19:24,844
It's on me!

344
00:19:25,305 --> 00:19:25,991
Fuck!

345
00:19:26,015 --> 00:19:29,561
Michael, don't do this! Listen, right!
There's no way back!

346
00:19:31,069 --> 00:19:33,163
Mike, what the fuck
are you doing?

347
00:19:36,535 --> 00:19:37,225
Mickey..

348
00:19:37,251 --> 00:19:39,689
They found me Johnny!
Do you understand me?!

349
00:19:39,903 --> 00:19:42,573
They found me and then
nearly fucking killed me!

350
00:19:42,659 --> 00:19:44,665
Fuck you Mickeeey!

351
00:19:46,883 --> 00:19:53,222
<i>This is the final boarding call for
passengers on the flight F43421C</i>

352
00:19:53,673 --> 00:19:55,194
to Kuala Lumpur.

353
00:19:55,236 --> 00:19:58,226
<i>Please proceed to
gate C, immediately.</i>

354
00:20:09,626 --> 00:20:12,214
<i>Thick clouds of
ash flew up today</i>

355
00:20:12,230 --> 00:20:14,605
<i>forcing airlines to cancel
thousands of flights.</i>

356
00:20:14,614 --> 00:20:19,008
<i>It drifted at high altitudes south & east,
from an erupting volcano in Iceland.</i>

357
00:20:19,438 --> 00:20:23,512
<i>The airspace shut-down was one of the
most sweeping ever ordered in peace time.</i>

358
00:20:23,790 --> 00:20:26,001
<i>The cloud made up of
minute particles of</i>

359
00:20:26,013 --> 00:20:28,616
<i>silicate, that can severely
damage jet engines,</i>

360
00:20:28,704 --> 00:20:32,872
<i>left airplanes stranded on the tarmac of
some of the world's busiest airports,</i>

361
00:20:32,964 --> 00:20:35,990
<i>as it spread over Britain and
towards continental Europe.</i>

362
00:20:36,182 --> 00:20:40,604
<i>5,000-6,000 of the 28,000 daily
flights across Europe were cancelled,</i>

363
00:20:40,710 --> 00:20:45,348
<i>or redirected to the nearest available
airports, as the results of the ash plume.</i>

364
00:20:45,489 --> 00:20:49,018
<i>The ash plume of volcano Eyjafjallajökull,
was reported to be drifting</i>

365
00:20:49,085 --> 00:20:52,118
<i>at 18,000-33,000 feet
above the earth.</i>

366
00:20:52,289 --> 00:20:56,003
<i>At those altitudes, the cloud is directly
in the road of commercial airliners...</i>

367
00:21:24,675 --> 00:21:26,414
Excuse me mate. Where are we?

368
00:21:29,687 --> 00:21:32,717
Sorry mate, I don't speak
Malaysian, I'm sorry.

369
00:21:37,367 --> 00:21:38,461
We found them.

370
00:21:39,167 --> 00:21:40,837
It was about fucking time.

371
00:21:41,133 --> 00:21:42,997
They didn't get as
far as Malaysia.

372
00:21:43,135 --> 00:21:45,306
Some big volcano has
just erupted in Iceland.

373
00:21:45,337 --> 00:21:46,941
The flight redirected.

374
00:21:47,115 --> 00:21:48,541
To Lithuania.

375
00:21:49,901 --> 00:21:51,775
Lith-a-fucking what?

376
00:21:51,959 --> 00:21:53,249
Lithuania?!

377
00:21:53,967 --> 00:21:55,109
Not Malaysia?!

378
00:21:55,511 --> 00:21:57,489
It's in Eastern fucking Europe.

379
00:21:57,651 --> 00:21:59,749
And the bastards
are still there.

380
00:21:59,849 --> 00:22:01,159
How?

381
00:22:01,549 --> 00:22:03,771
I mean how? How? How
did I get here?

382
00:22:04,011 --> 00:22:06,221
You arrive here
about two hours ago

383
00:22:06,461 --> 00:22:07,539
from the airport

384
00:22:07,621 --> 00:22:09,413
with three friends.

385
00:22:10,433 --> 00:22:12,327
I like them fucking Islandicks.

386
00:22:12,445 --> 00:22:14,935
But I like the
volcanoes even better.

387
00:22:15,225 --> 00:22:17,783
Let's get our asses
fucking out there.

388
00:22:35,323 --> 00:22:37,705
Hey barman, give me some vodka.

389
00:22:40,665 --> 00:22:41,847
Cheers fellow.

390
00:23:03,103 --> 00:23:04,989
Benny my boy, lucky tonight.

391
00:23:05,081 --> 00:23:06,355
See you back at the hotel.

392
00:23:06,399 --> 00:23:07,763
I'll see you later.

393
00:23:08,611 --> 00:23:11,453
Ben, don't you think we
should get back to the hotel.

394
00:23:11,534 --> 00:23:13,183
You've gone fucking soft?!

395
00:23:13,378 --> 00:23:15,243
I'm not going back to
some shitty hotel!

396
00:23:15,551 --> 00:23:18,841
Hello boys. Our hen party
needs some company.

397
00:23:19,191 --> 00:23:20,497
Where're you from?

398
00:23:20,839 --> 00:23:21,969
England.

399
00:23:24,367 --> 00:23:27,197
- Come on girls, surround them.
- All right ladies.

400
00:23:27,772 --> 00:23:29,797
Right here, fucking right here!

401
00:23:39,526 --> 00:23:40,526
Fuck!

402
00:24:26,776 --> 00:24:28,871
Oh, you dumb fucks!

403
00:24:47,281 --> 00:24:48,756
- Hello?
<i>- Michael?</i>

404
00:24:49,593 --> 00:24:50,915
Jessica, thank God!

405
00:24:50,971 --> 00:24:53,173
<i>Were you ever planning
on calling me back?</i>

406
00:24:53,417 --> 00:24:54,647
<i>How could you?</i>

407
00:24:54,759 --> 00:24:56,689
<i>What the hell is going on?</i>

408
00:24:56,907 --> 00:25:01,241
<i>What are you doing? Do you
have any idea how I feel?</i>

409
00:25:01,664 --> 00:25:03,081
Yes! Yes I know.

410
00:25:03,268 --> 00:25:05,581
I'll be back in a couple
of hours, I promise!

411
00:25:05,789 --> 00:25:08,605
<i>- I don't give a shit about your promises..</i>
- Jessie listen!

412
00:25:09,487 --> 00:25:10,906
<i>- To what?</i>
- Airport please mate.

413
00:25:11,097 --> 00:25:13,951
<i>You're going to the airport?
Without me?</i>

414
00:26:06,195 --> 00:26:07,854
Good night my friend.

415
00:26:35,251 --> 00:26:37,532
<i>And you can't even explain to
me where you pissed off to?!</i>

416
00:26:37,561 --> 00:26:41,371
<i>Why is that? Just don't call me anymore.
I don't want to hear shit anymore.</i>

417
00:26:41,438 --> 00:26:43,384
Jess, it's very, very confusing!

418
00:26:43,478 --> 00:26:44,336
<i>Is it?</i>

419
00:26:44,340 --> 00:26:45,736
But you have to trust me!

420
00:26:45,818 --> 00:26:46,854
<i>Are you sober?</i>

421
00:26:47,044 --> 00:26:47,661
Yes!

422
00:26:47,752 --> 00:26:49,120
<i>So where are you then?</i>

423
00:26:49,902 --> 00:26:51,980
Lithuan.. Oh, Jesus Christ.

424
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:53,720
- It doesn't really matter.
<i>- Yes, it does.</i>

425
00:26:53,824 --> 00:26:56,846
I will explain everything to
you, when it becomes clear.

426
00:27:03,458 --> 00:27:06,833
Why've we stop.. Look, can you just
wait a minute? Why've we stopped?

427
00:27:06,860 --> 00:27:09,758
Look! I need to get to the airport mate!
I'm in a bit of a hurry..

428
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:11,203
Who's this now?

429
00:27:14,988 --> 00:27:16,275
<i>What's going on?</i>

430
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:18,761
<i>- What the hell is happening?</i>
- What are you doing to me?

431
00:27:18,832 --> 00:27:20,240
<i>Are you at a party?</i>

432
00:27:37,004 --> 00:27:40,171
<i>You're a son of a bitch Michael. How can
you have fun when my heart's broken?</i>

433
00:27:40,222 --> 00:27:41,988
<i>How can I have ever
gotten with you?</i>

434
00:27:42,006 --> 00:27:43,432
<i>And you have nothing
to say for yourself?</i>

435
00:27:43,486 --> 00:27:45,032
<i>You can't even explain yourself?</i>

436
00:27:45,134 --> 00:27:46,189
<i>Fuck you..</i>

437
00:28:08,266 --> 00:28:09,405
Oh fuck!

438
00:28:10,242 --> 00:28:11,844
Oh Jesus Christ.

439
00:29:11,056 --> 00:29:12,120
Hi.

440
00:29:12,297 --> 00:29:14,595
I don't even know
how I got here.

441
00:29:14,832 --> 00:29:17,997
I don't know where any of my
friends are and I need help!

442
00:29:19,708 --> 00:29:21,879
Is your room 1402?

443
00:29:22,413 --> 00:29:24,547
No, yea.. I don't know, why?

444
00:29:25,049 --> 00:29:26,455
We came back..

445
00:29:26,555 --> 00:29:27,855
Hmm... Men!

446
00:29:27,909 --> 00:29:30,167
We said we're friends of yours.

447
00:29:31,977 --> 00:29:33,426
Did they now?!

448
00:29:36,021 --> 00:29:37,067
Johnny?!

449
00:29:37,375 --> 00:29:40,929
Johnny where are you?! Show
me your faces you li..

450
00:29:42,869 --> 00:29:44,523
- Fuck! Shit!
- That's him!

451
00:29:44,607 --> 00:29:46,013
Who are you? What do you want?

452
00:29:46,101 --> 00:29:48,051
I was going to ask
you the same thing.

453
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:50,675
Oh now, there's been
some kind of a mistake.

454
00:29:51,037 --> 00:29:51,947
Mistake?!

455
00:29:51,987 --> 00:29:54,435
Where there's a lot of greed,
there's plenty of mistakes.

456
00:29:54,712 --> 00:29:57,587
No! You see, I didn't
know anything.

457
00:29:57,666 --> 00:29:59,557
They set me up. They
ruined my plan.

458
00:29:59,711 --> 00:30:01,029
Plan?!

459
00:30:01,873 --> 00:30:04,927
Your plan is going to end
up the same way as Karl's.

460
00:30:08,635 --> 00:30:10,181
Where is the money?

461
00:30:11,570 --> 00:30:13,881
It was in here. I wanted
to give it back to you.

462
00:30:13,931 --> 00:30:17,381
I swear to God, I wanted
to give it back to you.

463
00:30:17,567 --> 00:30:19,414
Where's my fucking ring?

464
00:30:20,973 --> 00:30:22,915
What ring? I don't
know, I don't know.

465
00:30:25,911 --> 00:30:27,377
Get him up! Get him up!

466
00:30:27,825 --> 00:30:30,107
Okay, it's.. It's in my pocket.

467
00:30:40,798 --> 00:30:42,617
Where's my fucking ring?

468
00:30:44,333 --> 00:30:47,135
- I just gave..
- Tony Montana gave me that fucking ring!

469
00:30:47,199 --> 00:30:48,677
Does that ring any
bells with you?

470
00:30:48,767 --> 00:30:50,185
Now where's my fucking ring?

471
00:30:50,197 --> 00:30:52,389
I don't have anything
else to give to you.

472
00:30:52,457 --> 00:30:56,455
I don't even fucking know how I got
here, what more can I fucking give.

473
00:30:56,465 --> 00:30:58,303
- Shut the fuck up!
- Fucking hell!

474
00:30:58,371 --> 00:31:00,095
Get him in there!

475
00:31:01,727 --> 00:31:03,573
You must fucking like this?!

476
00:31:04,132 --> 00:31:05,981
Open the door! Police.

477
00:31:14,263 --> 00:31:15,709
Hello.

478
00:31:17,100 --> 00:31:19,827
These guys. You know them?

479
00:31:23,433 --> 00:31:25,855
- Yes. yes, I know them, yes.
- Good.

480
00:31:26,904 --> 00:31:29,183
You must go with us. Come on!

481
00:31:32,713 --> 00:31:34,835
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

482
00:31:44,537 --> 00:31:47,476
Don't look like we're leaving
this place any time soon lads.

483
00:31:48,411 --> 00:31:50,838
We need a motor. Let's
go find uncle Sam.

484
00:31:51,310 --> 00:31:52,820
Officer?! Sir?!

485
00:31:54,024 --> 00:31:56,262
The Mob.. Gangsters..

486
00:31:56,336 --> 00:31:59,166
From London, really,
very, very serious men.

487
00:31:59,260 --> 00:32:02,262
They're in my hotel.
They want their money.

488
00:32:03,052 --> 00:32:06,539
But, it was taken, you
see, it's all gone.

489
00:32:09,544 --> 00:32:11,362
You know this?

490
00:32:16,037 --> 00:32:17,918
You want me to be
honest with you?!

491
00:32:18,422 --> 00:32:20,228
They're not my actual friends.

492
00:32:20,778 --> 00:32:24,324
In fact, I barely fucking know
them, but that is not important.

493
00:32:26,282 --> 00:32:28,304
They are going to kill me.

494
00:32:28,625 --> 00:32:30,442
You have to believe me!

495
00:32:40,390 --> 00:32:41,864
What's money?

496
00:32:42,112 --> 00:32:43,682
Who robbed you?

497
00:32:44,040 --> 00:32:45,130
You?

498
00:32:45,194 --> 00:32:46,850
How much money?

499
00:32:46,992 --> 00:32:48,066
When?

500
00:32:48,112 --> 00:32:49,167
Money, I..

501
00:32:49,924 --> 00:32:51,282
What money?

502
00:32:51,697 --> 00:32:52,548
No, no, no..

503
00:32:52,672 --> 00:32:54,072
It's all good.

504
00:32:54,255 --> 00:32:55,549
It's my fuck-up.

505
00:34:26,438 --> 00:34:29,453
Four iron dicks and
two balls for each.

506
00:34:30,910 --> 00:34:32,220
How much for all of them?

507
00:34:38,206 --> 00:34:40,953
8,000. You won't
find any cheaper.

508
00:34:42,258 --> 00:34:44,375
Is that right? Is that so?

509
00:34:46,308 --> 00:34:48,042
Cheeky little fucker, isn't he?

510
00:34:49,266 --> 00:34:51,736
Fuck it. Pay him and
let's get out of here.

511
00:34:58,272 --> 00:35:00,790

<i>You piece of shit! Asshole!</i>

00:48:31,419 --> 00:48:33,069
<i>You haven't even
bothered to apologize.</i>

570
00:48:33,119 --> 00:48:33,969
Look, Jessica..

571
00:48:34,019 --> 00:48:36,660

<i>Oh I understand all right!</i>

573
00:48:38,393 --> 00:48:40,043
<i>You and your Lithuanian bitches!</i>

574
00:48:40,093 --> 00:48:41,559
<i>You met another woman.</i>

Can you move?

579
00:49:49,117 --> 00:49:51,631
Your fucking radiator
is on top of me.

580
00:49:53,973 --> 00:49:55,331
My radiator?!

581
00:49:55,850 --> 00:49:56,850
Ask me..

582
00:49:57,175 --> 00:49:58,875
How I've become attached
to this fucking radiator.

583
00:49:58,891 --> 00:50:01,357
I should have killed you
in that fucking apartment.

584
00:50:01,481 --> 00:50:02,711
Fuck you!

585
00:50:08,985 --> 00:50:11,611
You skinny, Lithuanian bitch!

586
00:50:11,939 --> 00:50:13,409
I trusted you!

587
00:50:13,860 --> 00:50:14,737
And you left me

588
00:50:14,837 --> 00:50:15,937
naked

589
00:50:15,971 --> 00:50:17,441
covered in claret (BLOOD)

590
00:50:17,583 --> 00:50:19,321
handcuffed!

591
00:50:19,673 --> 00:50:21,515
Hey, steady..

592
00:50:22,397 --> 00:50:23,731
It's my phone.

593
00:50:23,791 --> 00:50:25,185
It's in the pocket.

594
00:50:25,579 --> 00:50:26,649
Can you help?

595
00:50:27,211 --> 00:50:28,561
Help.. you?!

596
00:50:29,313 --> 00:50:30,459

597
00:50:30,559 --> 00:50:32,759
Since you can't
help yourself, ha?!

598
00:50:35,191 --> 00:50:36,577
Fine.

599
00:50:58,109 --> 00:50:59,411
Woa, woa, woa..

600
00:50:59,745 --> 00:51:01,019
Lads, lads, lads..

601
00:51:01,241 --> 00:51:02,659
Wh.. What's going on?

602
00:51:03,380 --> 00:51:05,123
Wh.. What're you doing to me?

603
00:51:05,248 --> 00:51:07,387
Hey, I'm military! Do
you understand that?

604
00:51:07,549 --> 00:51:09,551
That means they'll
come looking for me.

605
00:51:09,815 --> 00:51:11,316
And they'll find me to. That..

606
00:51:11,616 --> 00:51:13,016
That.. That is for sure!

607
00:51:13,259 --> 00:51:14,497
Oh, come on lads.

608
00:51:14,611 --> 00:51:18,041
I work for her Majesty' service.
Do you understand? The Queen?

609
00:51:18,457 --> 00:51:19,659
Oh come on, lads.

610
00:51:19,759 --> 00:51:23,559
I'm the head of the honorary guard.
I'm a very important person!

611
00:51:24,032 --> 00:51:25,274
Yeah?!

612
00:54:02,338 --> 00:54:03,602
Fuck.

613
00:54:07,290 --> 00:54:08,840
Tim, get up!

614
00:54:31,452 --> 00:54:34,026
I don't mean to be
rude, darling, but..

615
00:54:34,697 --> 00:54:35,866
Do we know each other?

616
00:54:36,036 --> 00:54:37,510
Fuck you.

617
00:54:38,198 --> 00:54:39,524
And by the way..

618
00:54:39,686 --> 00:54:42,076
You both having me a striptease

619
00:54:42,267 --> 00:54:43,988
for my party.

620
00:54:46,160 --> 00:54:48,582
Aw fuck! Where'd you
get my ring from?

621
00:54:49,306 --> 00:54:50,560
You gave it to me

622
00:54:50,660 --> 00:54:51,960
as my wedding gift.

623
00:54:52,428 --> 00:54:53,578
Wedding?!

624
00:54:55,154 --> 00:54:57,020
What fucking wedding?

625
00:54:57,310 --> 00:54:59,396
My wedding, your gift!

626
00:54:59,568 --> 00:55:01,417
Do you remember anything?

627
00:55:03,160 --> 00:55:04,254
Whatever!

628
00:55:04,458 --> 00:55:05,480
I want my ring!

629
00:55:05,588 --> 00:55:07,396
Let me go man!

630
00:55:09,832 --> 00:55:11,298
This ring costs too much

631
00:55:11,390 --> 00:55:14,416
to give to some fucking..

632
00:55:15,576 --> 00:55:17,026
Fucking hell.

633
00:55:26,444 --> 00:55:27,915
Who's that?

634
00:55:28,094 --> 00:55:29,266
My fiancé.

635
00:55:29,416 --> 00:55:31,447
We are getting married tomorrow.

636
00:55:32,064 --> 00:55:33,578
All right.

637
00:55:36,864 --> 00:55:39,886
Maybe your boyfriend can
take us to the hotel.

638
00:55:40,454 --> 00:55:43,204
Jesus Christ, I'll
fucking pay him.

639
00:56:05,696 --> 00:56:07,239
You dirty bastard!

640
00:56:09,630 --> 00:56:11,644
That is not fucking me!

641
00:56:11,744 --> 00:56:12,744
Staska.

642
00:56:14,786 --> 00:56:15,786
Fucking take it.

643
00:56:32,978 --> 00:56:34,280
Look, love..

644
00:56:34,688 --> 00:56:36,258
Just give us the ring back

645
00:56:36,716 --> 00:56:38,926
and we'll fucking leave.

646
00:56:38,997 --> 00:56:41,070
Yeah. We've got to make
a move, to be honest.

647
00:56:41,165 --> 00:56:42,586
It's been an absolute pleasure.

648
00:56:43,048 --> 00:56:44,886
Leave the fucking ring, yeah?!

649
00:56:44,984 --> 00:56:46,802
Peace. Bye bye.

650
00:58:53,334 --> 00:58:54,341
Forrest Timmy!

651
00:58:54,441 --> 00:58:55,841
Run for the switch!

652
00:59:44,804 --> 00:59:46,215
Hey pal!

653
00:59:46,460 --> 00:59:48,350
Can you help us?

654
00:59:52,344 --> 00:59:54,562
Why the fuck he's running for.
What's he..

655
00:59:58,170 --> 00:59:59,416
Oh for fuck's sake.

656
00:59:59,680 --> 01:00:02,022
Why would you change the side
of the fucking steering wheel?!

657
01:00:02,072 --> 01:00:03,422
Why would you fucking do that?!

658
01:00:03,453 --> 01:00:05,500
- Move over you fucking cunt.

659
01:00:05,537 --> 01:00:07,515

660
01:00:07,565 --> 01:00:09,015

With what, eh?! The
fucking phone?!

664
01:01:01,489 --> 01:01:03,383
It's in the forest somewhere.

665
01:01:05,419 --> 01:01:07,513

Well I don't know, do I?

670
01:01:42,917 --> 01:01:45,224
Hey Tim, look at all this grass.

671
01:01:45,599 --> 01:01:48,089
You eat like a fucking
rabbit, don't you?!

672
01:01:49,375 --> 01:01:51,229
I knew this would go tits up.

673
01:01:51,613 --> 01:01:52,919
But like a mug

674
01:01:53,119 --> 01:01:54,319
I've signed up for it.

675
01:01:54,679 --> 01:01:55,693
With another mug.

676
01:01:55,793 --> 01:01:57,493
You!

It's a fucking tattoo.

680
01:02:10,643 --> 01:02:11,977
When?

681
01:02:17,877 --> 01:02:18,511

Jesus Christ!

685
01:03:24,944 --> 01:03:26,347
That ain't Jesus.

686
01:03:26,911 --> 01:03:28,169
Not at all.

687
01:03:45,609 --> 01:03:46,609

There is no God in
this fucking country.

750
01:11:43,406 --> 01:11:46,001
It's not our plane
for Malaysia?!

751
01:12:44,474 --> 01:12:45,753
Sure.

752

My mates are probably..

01:13:07,977 --> 01:13:09,446
On their way already.

758
01:13:11,382 --> 01:13:12,792
I'm jealous.

759
01:13:15,942 --> 01:13:17,396
Hold that thought.

760
01:13:17,878 --> 01:13:18,878

761
01:13:19,114 --> 01:13:20,436
Will be back in a sec.

762
01:14:39,030 --> 01:14:40,612
So, what's next?

763
01:14:41,007 --> 01:14:42,790
I'd just love to get
rid of this thing.

764
01:14:43,212 --> 01:14:44,686
Keep it as a souvenir.

Get back!

779
01:16:29,124 --> 01:16:30,674
The money's in the hotel.

780
01:16:30,777 --> 01:16:32,594
In the toilet. I'll
show you everything.

781
01:16:32,732 --> 01:16:34,295
Don't worry about the money.

782
01:16:34,640 --> 01:16:36,082
We have the money.

783
01:16:37,288 --> 01:16:39,150
I got a little surprise for you.

784
01:16:46,816 --> 01:16:48,150
Mickey, forgive me.

785
01:16:48,567 --> 01:16:49,988
Forgive me Mickey.

786
01:16:58,270 --> 01:17:00,884
I will fucking kill you myself!

787
01:17:01,026 --> 01:17:02,476
You fucking cunt!

788
01:17:06,870 --> 01:17:08,560
Are we finished ladies?

789
01:17:12,076 --> 01:17:14,134
Now where's my fucking ring?

790
01:17:14,644 --> 01:17:15,982
Ring?

791
01:17:21,972 --> 01:17:23,702
That fucking ring!

792
01:17:24,097 --> 01:17:25,974
Fucking Johnny, you cunt!

793
01:17:26,046 --> 01:17:27,504
Don't fuck with me!

794
01:17:39,946 --> 01:17:41,376
<i>Hello, Johnny?</i>

795
01:17:42,168 --> 01:17:43,168
Johnny?

796
01:17:43,750 --> 01:17:45,332
<i>It's Ben, hello?</i>

797
01:17:45,654 --> 01:17:47,476
You listen to me very carefully!

798
01:17:47,570 --> 01:17:48,342
Who is this?

799
01:17:48,520 --> 01:17:49,683
Where's Johnny?

800
01:17:49,846 --> 01:17:50,846
Where's Michael?

801
01:17:51,232 --> 01:17:53,418
Your two mates will fucking live

802
01:17:53,640 --> 01:17:55,570
as long as my
patience holds out.

803
01:17:56,094 --> 01:17:57,880
Now, you bring my
fucking ring to me

804
01:17:57,910 --> 01:18:00,960
and you bring it very delicately,
between your fucking teeth!

805
01:18:01,144 --> 01:18:02,571
<i>Do you understand?</i>

806
01:18:04,264 --> 01:18:05,918
<i>I said, do you understand?!</i>

807
01:18:18,624 --> 01:18:19,858
Now, one more pause out of you

808
01:18:19,972 --> 01:18:21,902
and I'm gonna blow his
fucking skull away

809
01:18:21,952 --> 01:18:23,782
over this fucking call!

810
01:18:27,972 --> 01:18:29,025
Talk!

811
01:18:29,224 --> 01:18:30,478
Listen Ben!

812
01:18:30,616 --> 01:18:32,262
<i>We need the fucking ring!</i>

813
01:18:32,714 --> 01:18:33,996
What fucking ring?!

814
01:18:34,956 --> 01:18:36,462
We need cash!

815
01:18:36,674 --> 01:18:37,792
Ben, listen.

816
01:18:37,976 --> 01:18:39,073
There's no money.

817
01:18:39,122 --> 01:18:39,972
What?

818
01:18:40,032 --> 01:18:43,122
Just bring the fucking ring,
we're gonna fucking die.

819
01:18:43,162 --> 01:18:44,764
Just bring the fucking ring!

820
01:18:46,752 --> 01:18:49,326
That's great Johnny,
that's right.

821
01:18:50,124 --> 01:18:51,974
That's right Johnny,
bring the money.

822
01:18:55,670 --> 01:18:56,756
I don't have the ring.

823
01:18:56,814 --> 01:18:59,160
I don't have that fucking
ring, okay, but..

824
01:18:59,232 --> 01:19:00,232
Great!

825
01:19:00,327 --> 01:19:01,902
That's great! You've
got the ring.

826

Hello mate.

I wonder if you could help us.

886
01:33:08,022 --> 01:33:09,432

887
01:33:18,123 --> 01:33:19,848
Sorry mate, didn't
