1
00:01:30,508 --> 00:01:32,010
Did you talk to anyone? Look at me.

2
00:01:32,093 --> 00:01:35,096
Talk to anybody, huh?
Did you see anybody?

3
00:01:35,180 --> 00:01:37,766
Did you talk to anybody, huh?

4
00:01:37,849 --> 00:01:40,143
Did you make a phone call?

5
00:01:41,644 --> 00:01:43,313
Who did you talk to?

6
00:01:57,368 --> 00:02:01,039
Got anything else to say?
I didn't think so.

7
00:02:06,377 --> 00:02:09,756
- How long was he out of your sight?
- Maybe a couple of minutes.

8
00:02:09,839 --> 00:02:12,634
Chico, I'm disappointed in you!
How could you do that?

9
00:02:12,717 --> 00:02:17,263
Look, we can't go into that meeting.
If anyone was ever made, we were made.

10
00:02:17,347 --> 00:02:19,974
You know what I say? We're going.

11
00:02:20,892 --> 00:02:23,144
What are you? Are you crazy?

12
00:02:23,228 --> 00:02:25,355
I mean, probably a hundred people
saw us chasing him.

13
00:02:25,438 --> 00:02:26,689
Chico!

14
00:02:27,232 --> 00:02:31,778
Since when did anybody ever accuse
me of being sane? We're going.

15
00:02:31,861 --> 00:02:34,155
- All right? Come on. Come on.
- Jesus Christ.

16
00:03:39,846 --> 00:03:41,806
You see anything strange?

17
00:03:41,890 --> 00:03:43,850
Just the usual weirdness.

18
00:03:48,730 --> 00:03:50,815
The deal's going down, man.

19
00:03:53,735 --> 00:03:56,487
- Keep an eye out for me, huh?
- Right, Hatcher.

20
00:03:58,781 --> 00:04:01,743
- Are you sure it's cool?
- It's very cool. Relax.

21
00:04:01,826 --> 00:04:03,328
Good. Then let's go.

22
00:04:04,913 --> 00:04:07,790
And next time, you're going to
introduce me to Salazar, aren't you?

23
00:04:07,874 --> 00:04:09,792
- Yes, I promise.
- All right. Let's go.

24
00:04:09,876 --> 00:04:11,836
- You got it.
- All right.

25
00:04:29,729 --> 00:04:31,898
Well, here we are, gentlemen.
Right on time.

26
00:04:31,981 --> 00:04:35,443
You see? I told you.
This guy, he's been a good customer.

27
00:04:36,569 --> 00:04:40,698
- Did you bring the green?
- Of course. Got it right here.

28
00:04:46,037 --> 00:04:48,706
- Half.
- Then what are you here for?

29
00:04:49,332 --> 00:04:52,877
I'm here to do business. If you don't
like that, then I'll take off, all right?

30
00:04:57,048 --> 00:04:59,634
You know something?
I do business for a long time.

31
00:04:59,717 --> 00:05:02,136
You know why? 'Cause I'm careful.

32
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:06,474
- You can never be too careful, right?
- Careful is good with me, <i>amigo.</i>

33
00:05:06,557 --> 00:05:08,893
- Careful never killed nobody.
- Is that right?

34
00:05:09,310 --> 00:05:12,814
Stupid. Stupid kills, me entiendes?

35
00:05:12,897 --> 00:05:17,193
- Okay, gringo, I think we can do business.
- Good. Then let's get it over with, all right?

36
00:05:17,276 --> 00:05:19,404
What's the matter? Hey, how you doing?

37
00:05:49,017 --> 00:05:53,938
You know, in our country, we love cops.

38
00:05:54,313 --> 00:05:58,276
When we do a cop,
it's like a tremendous status symbol.

39
00:05:59,068 --> 00:06:03,656
But an American cop
is like a gift from God.

40
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:06,284
My little friend here is gonna
open you up a little bit

41
00:06:06,367 --> 00:06:09,662
so you can tell us where
the rest of the money is, huh?

42
00:06:10,830 --> 00:06:14,125
- There is no more money.
- There's gotta be more money.

43
00:06:27,138 --> 00:06:29,432
Hatcher, let's get the hell out of here!
Come on!

44
00:06:31,851 --> 00:06:33,978
Cover me!

45
00:06:35,104 --> 00:06:36,606
- All right. Clear.
- Let's go.

46
00:06:36,689 --> 00:06:38,316
- Quickly.
- Okay.

47
00:07:20,358 --> 00:07:22,276
Time to go, Hatch.

48
00:07:56,394 --> 00:07:58,521
I knew that the only justice
that I could get

49
00:07:58,604 --> 00:08:02,692
would be that that I made for myself,
not always by law.

50
00:08:03,901 --> 00:08:07,405
Father, I just killed a woman.

51
00:08:09,991 --> 00:08:13,494
I've lied, I've slept with informants,

52
00:08:13,578 --> 00:08:16,289
I've taken drugs, I've falsified evidence.

53
00:08:17,456 --> 00:08:20,626
I did whatever I had to do
to get the bad guys.

54
00:08:23,421 --> 00:08:25,506
Then I realized something.

55
00:08:27,967 --> 00:08:31,387
That I had become what I most despised.

56
00:08:31,470 --> 00:08:34,682
- Do you have a family?
- Yes, Father.

57
00:08:35,766 --> 00:08:39,353
Go to them and leave these things.

58
00:08:39,437 --> 00:08:44,859
Try to find the gentle self inside you.
Allow this person to come back.

59
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:54,076
What are you gonna
retire to, Hatcher, huh?

60
00:08:54,952 --> 00:08:57,205
You're up your neck in this life.

61
00:09:00,082 --> 00:09:02,710
I got Bennett burning up
the phone lines every day.

62
00:09:02,793 --> 00:09:04,587
I got the President going on television,

63
00:09:04,670 --> 00:09:07,465
promising results, for Christ's sake.

64
00:09:07,548 --> 00:09:10,551
This is not the time for you
to walk out on me. Not now.

65
00:09:10,635 --> 00:09:13,304
- You can't...
- I've had enough.

66
00:09:16,182 --> 00:09:18,351
Look,John.

67
00:09:20,686 --> 00:09:23,689
There was nothing you could've done
to save Chico.

68
00:09:23,773 --> 00:09:25,691
These things happen when you're in deep.
You know that.

69
00:09:25,775 --> 00:09:29,237
Take a leave. With pay.

70
00:09:30,321 --> 00:09:32,531
Hell, take a month. Take two.

71
00:09:32,615 --> 00:09:34,450
You've felt burned out before this.

72
00:09:34,533 --> 00:09:36,994
I need you, John, okay?

73
00:09:38,663 --> 00:09:43,334
Pete, nothing we ever did
amounted to shit, and you know it.

74
00:10:38,139 --> 00:10:41,017
- Who is it?
- Uncle John.

75
00:10:45,313 --> 00:10:48,941
You're not my uncle.
My uncle John lives far away.

76
00:10:49,025 --> 00:10:52,778
I am your uncle,
and you've grown up to be a big girl.

77
00:10:54,113 --> 00:10:57,116
- You allergic to cats?
- Nope.

78
00:10:57,199 --> 00:11:00,828
- Okay, then you can come in.
- Tracey, come on back...

79
00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:04,915
Johnny? Johnny!

80
00:11:04,999 --> 00:11:07,752
- I can't believe it. Oh, God!
- How's my little sister?

81
00:11:13,924 --> 00:11:16,802
Boys, come and say hello
to your uncle John. Come on.

82
00:11:16,886 --> 00:11:18,262
- Who's this?
- This is Ricky.

83
00:11:18,346 --> 00:11:22,475
Ricky, how you doing? You look great.
You look good. Everything's all right?

84
00:11:22,558 --> 00:11:25,353
- Yeah, everything's great.
- Hey, Uncle John.

85
00:11:25,436 --> 00:11:28,522
- Hey, how you doing?
- All right. Welcome home.

86
00:11:28,606 --> 00:11:31,233
- Where you been?
- I've been here, waiting for you.

87
00:11:35,988 --> 00:11:37,948
You're home!

88
00:11:40,951 --> 00:11:44,413
Let me look at you. You look great.

89
00:11:44,497 --> 00:11:46,874
You look great.
Why, you look like Melissa now, huh?

90
00:11:46,957 --> 00:11:48,793
- Twenty years younger.
- Thank you.

91
00:11:48,876 --> 00:11:52,380
I accept all compliments
from handsome men.

92
00:11:52,463 --> 00:11:54,840
Everything all right?
You sounded strange on the phone.

93
00:11:54,924 --> 00:11:57,593
No. It's all right. I'm just a little tired.

94
00:11:57,676 --> 00:12:00,513
Well, you've come
to the right place to rest.

95
00:14:03,177 --> 00:14:04,512
Head up!

96
00:14:11,936 --> 00:14:13,145
Head up!

97
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:20,736
- Cool!
- Make you happy?

98
00:14:20,819 --> 00:14:24,698
Hey, we have lots more
where that come from, you know.

99
00:14:24,782 --> 00:14:28,369
Don't worry about it. Be happy.

100
00:14:28,452 --> 00:14:30,246
- Ready?
- Break!

101
00:14:35,501 --> 00:14:36,877
Let's go! Let's go!

102
00:14:38,796 --> 00:14:42,883
Come up and play!
Play it again. One more time.

103
00:14:42,967 --> 00:14:46,679
Harris, you're a failure! Tackling
ten yards down the field ain't shit!

104
00:14:46,762 --> 00:14:49,181
Pardon my French. Get back in the huddle.

105
00:14:49,265 --> 00:14:51,642
- Come on. Let's go!
- Coach?

106
00:14:51,725 --> 00:14:55,229
Coach, put me in. Put me in.

107
00:14:57,565 --> 00:15:00,818
I'll be damned. Trouble.

108
00:15:01,694 --> 00:15:03,320
That's me.

109
00:15:04,863 --> 00:15:07,449
And I heard you were shot dead
in the streets of Bangkok.

110
00:15:07,533 --> 00:15:10,911
Well, I was in Bangkok. I was there.

111
00:15:10,995 --> 00:15:14,415
But I didn't get shot,
if that's all right with you.

112
00:15:14,498 --> 00:15:15,916
Hell, yeah!

113
00:15:19,670 --> 00:15:21,922
- All right, Coach, we're ready.
- I'll be right back.

114
00:15:22,006 --> 00:15:24,675
Hey, come on! Come on! Show this guy
you can play some ball.

115
00:15:24,758 --> 00:15:28,429
You know, if you like that, you should
try some of this thing right here.

116
00:15:28,512 --> 00:15:32,141
Send you right to heaven.
Make cloud nine look soft.

117
00:15:32,224 --> 00:15:35,853
- Is that crack?
- That it is, man. You know, the real deal.

118
00:15:35,936 --> 00:15:39,106
- The shit you hear about on the news.
- Hey, it's funny, you know,

119
00:15:39,189 --> 00:15:43,611
how the man always tell lie about
certain things what make us happy.

120
00:15:43,694 --> 00:15:47,406
But you don't want to try this.
It too tough.

121
00:15:47,489 --> 00:15:50,242
Women, it make them want
to love all the time, you know?

122
00:15:50,326 --> 00:15:51,785
- I'll try it.
- All the time.

123
00:15:51,869 --> 00:15:52,911
Sure thing, pretty girl.

124
00:15:52,995 --> 00:15:55,956
Go on, put it right up to your lips.
You ready?

125
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:58,876
- Break!
- Four laps then hit the showers.

126
00:16:01,337 --> 00:16:03,756
Why, you were gone so long,
you missed my entire marriage.

127
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:06,967
- How was it?
- Cambodia was more fun.

128
00:16:07,051 --> 00:16:08,469
I mean, I love giving away
all my possessions.

129
00:16:08,552 --> 00:16:10,220
It makes me feel real spiritual.

130
00:16:10,304 --> 00:16:12,348
- And probably poor, huh?
- And poor!

131
00:16:26,695 --> 00:16:28,656
It's all right. Let's go.

132
00:16:29,907 --> 00:16:33,160
Get in the car. Get in the car.
Get in the car. Get in the car.

133
00:17:23,168 --> 00:17:28,507
Tito Barco, we're glad you come
to show some respect.

134
00:17:28,590 --> 00:17:30,092
Walk up.

135
00:17:35,013 --> 00:17:37,307
- Check him clean.
- Cool.

136
00:17:37,391 --> 00:17:39,309
Do your best, man.

137
00:17:48,819 --> 00:17:50,779
You very funny, man.

138
00:17:55,159 --> 00:17:56,994
Wait here for the man.

139
00:18:14,219 --> 00:18:15,888
Forward.

140
00:18:23,353 --> 00:18:27,816
You move into my territory.
What do you think I'm going to do?

141
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:31,111
The streets will be red with blood
and nobody makes money.

142
00:18:31,195 --> 00:18:36,283
They don't even notice us.
We fit in. We look like them.

143
00:18:36,366 --> 00:18:37,993
But you?

144
00:18:38,076 --> 00:18:42,998
You go marching into the suburbs
with your rag-head soldiers

145
00:18:43,081 --> 00:18:45,501
and we're front-page news.

146
00:18:45,584 --> 00:18:50,297
The DEA will be crawling down
our throats long after you've gone.

147
00:18:50,380 --> 00:18:53,425
Everybody want go heaven

148
00:18:54,051 --> 00:18:56,094
but nobody want dead.

149
00:18:58,388 --> 00:18:59,723
Afraid?

150
00:19:15,906 --> 00:19:17,991
This is how it'll go.

151
00:19:19,618 --> 00:19:22,496
You a work for I man now.

152
00:19:22,579 --> 00:19:25,958
You a do the selling.

153
00:19:26,041 --> 00:19:28,961
You a be the mule.

154
00:19:30,128 --> 00:19:33,924
I supply the crack and the powder.

155
00:19:34,007 --> 00:19:35,843
What's the split?

156
00:19:35,926 --> 00:19:39,263
Twenty percent to you.

157
00:19:47,396 --> 00:19:51,233
Give me some time to consider
your proposition.

158
00:19:51,316 --> 00:19:54,903
I will give you an answer very soon.

159
00:19:55,988 --> 00:20:00,242
I a wait and watch.

160
00:20:00,325 --> 00:20:02,411
I and I see everything.

161
00:20:05,789 --> 00:20:08,959
I and I be everywhere.

162
00:20:20,304 --> 00:20:24,725
The santero told me that you are the
one with the most frightening power,

163
00:20:24,808 --> 00:20:27,311
that you are the one I must seek.

164
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:42,200
This man is not only Abakué,
the leopard people.

165
00:20:47,331 --> 00:20:51,084
This man is using the power of the spirits

166
00:20:51,168 --> 00:20:53,795
to do very evil things.

167
00:20:55,339 --> 00:20:58,008
Will you... Will you help me?

168
00:21:09,770 --> 00:21:11,855
I hope to see you again.

169
00:23:27,199 --> 00:23:28,992
Looks good.

170
00:23:29,076 --> 00:23:32,079
Nice to be back. Your team looks great.

171
00:23:32,162 --> 00:23:37,793
It looks good now. Last year one
of my best players OD'd on cocaine.

172
00:23:37,876 --> 00:23:40,087
I remember when the worst problem
I had to worry about

173
00:23:40,170 --> 00:23:43,757
was one of them knocking up some girl.
Not any more.

174
00:23:44,091 --> 00:23:45,509
I think I remember this place.

175
00:23:45,592 --> 00:23:48,762
Wasn't this the place where
all the ugly girls worked?

176
00:23:56,728 --> 00:24:01,274
- Hey, Nurse! Got an emergency here!
- Call a doctor!

177
00:24:01,358 --> 00:24:04,778
Listen, give me a beer,
and give my man here a double.

178
00:24:04,861 --> 00:24:06,530
You know, I don't do
doubles on the first date.

179
00:24:06,613 --> 00:24:08,198
Now, that's not what I heard.

180
00:24:10,617 --> 00:24:13,578
- This is my boy Hatch.
- Hi, Hatch.

181
00:24:28,093 --> 00:24:30,428
<i>- They're going in.</i>
- Okay.

182
00:24:47,487 --> 00:24:50,282
- Some hormones in here.
- Yeah!

183
00:24:59,124 --> 00:25:02,335
Looks like one of the locals
is doing some dealing.

184
00:25:02,419 --> 00:25:05,463
- Supplementing his income.
- Leave it alone, man.

185
00:25:05,839 --> 00:25:08,175
- Leave it alone.
- Leave it alone?

186
00:25:08,258 --> 00:25:10,844
He's buying dope from the Jamaicans
and selling it to his friends.

187
00:25:10,927 --> 00:25:13,096
Look, I've been all over the world
with this stuff and you know it.

188
00:25:13,180 --> 00:25:14,931
It ain't just the Jamaicans. It's everybody

189
00:25:15,015 --> 00:25:17,642
But that's the same guy
I saw down by the school today.

190
00:25:17,726 --> 00:25:20,770
And every time I see something going
down, I see him. There he is.

191
00:25:33,783 --> 00:25:39,372
Last month, my 13-year-old nephew died
in a crack house run by these guys.

192
00:25:39,456 --> 00:25:41,333
- That cut it for me.
- I'm sorry.

193
00:25:41,416 --> 00:25:43,335
Look, I've had it.

194
00:25:44,419 --> 00:25:47,214
And now it seems
they're moving in down here.

195
00:25:47,297 --> 00:25:49,090
I'm just waiting
to do something, you hear?

196
00:25:49,174 --> 00:25:52,093
Let me tell you something.
There's nothing you can do about it

197
00:25:52,177 --> 00:25:55,347
and there never was, all right?

198
00:25:56,306 --> 00:25:58,475
Yeah, but you gotta try
to protect your own.

199
00:25:58,558 --> 00:26:01,311
Or are you so burnt out
you can't relate to that?

200
00:26:01,394 --> 00:26:03,188
No, I can relate to that.

201
00:26:14,824 --> 00:26:15,951
Excuse me.

202
00:26:32,676 --> 00:26:34,135
Blood and fire!

203
00:26:46,356 --> 00:26:47,899
Yo!

204
00:26:53,863 --> 00:26:55,824
Move out! Move out!

205
00:26:56,658 --> 00:26:58,868
Come on! Call an ambulance!

206
00:27:07,210 --> 00:27:10,839
Hey, boy, somebody about dead tonight.

207
00:27:13,174 --> 00:27:17,804
Me not know you, no. But I promise you,
you is a dead man walking.

208
00:27:17,887 --> 00:27:19,347
So what else is new?

209
00:27:34,362 --> 00:27:37,324
- Give me some room here!
- Come on. Let's go.

210
00:27:39,993 --> 00:27:42,287
Let's clear the area. Clear that area.

211
00:27:50,086 --> 00:27:53,631
You're dead, boy, hear? Dead!

212
00:27:55,008 --> 00:27:57,844
- Welcome home.
- Was that the suspect, Mr. Hatcher?

213
00:27:57,927 --> 00:28:02,182
- Yeah, the first guy up there.
- All right, watch it, people.

214
00:28:02,265 --> 00:28:04,601
Stay back behind the lines.

215
00:28:04,684 --> 00:28:07,228
Like Los Angeles,
New York and Washington,

216
00:28:07,312 --> 00:28:10,482
small-town America
now has blood in its streets

217
00:28:10,565 --> 00:28:15,028
as a gang shootout in Lincoln Heights
tonight has left four dead.

218
00:28:15,111 --> 00:28:18,698
Although less than one percent
of Jamaican immigrants are involved,

219
00:28:18,782 --> 00:28:21,034
Jamaican gangs, known as posses,

220
00:28:21,117 --> 00:28:23,703
are now dominating
the American drug trade

221
00:28:23,787 --> 00:28:28,208
with more than 10,000 members
trafficking drugs in 20 states.

222
00:28:28,291 --> 00:28:30,502
According to Justice Department officials,

223
00:28:30,585 --> 00:28:33,505
they are as disciplined as they are violent.

224
00:28:33,588 --> 00:28:36,049
Torture and maiming
are posse trademarks,

225
00:28:36,132 --> 00:28:40,303
and posse gunmen are said to prefer
shooting their victims in public.

226
00:28:40,387 --> 00:28:45,934
Sources estimate they have committed
1,400 murders in three and a half years.

227
00:28:46,017 --> 00:28:49,479
Dale Harimoto, WXTV, Chicago.

228
00:28:49,562 --> 00:28:51,981
- Stay back. Watch it.
- Sheriff O'Dwyer.

229
00:28:54,651 --> 00:28:57,320
I'm Sheriff O'Dwyer. Who might you be?

230
00:28:57,404 --> 00:29:00,573
Roselli, FBI, OC Task Force.
We're taking over here.

231
00:29:00,657 --> 00:29:03,410
- By what authority?
- United States Government Code,

232
00:29:03,493 --> 00:29:05,412
Title 18, Section 111.

233
00:29:05,495 --> 00:29:08,415
Go get their statements. Keep the
looky-loos out of the crime scene.

234
00:29:08,498 --> 00:29:11,251
- Yes, sir.
- You're excused, Sheriff.

235
00:29:11,334 --> 00:29:13,294
Roselli, I won't forget this.

236
00:29:13,378 --> 00:29:15,755
You and your agents so much as spit
on the deck around here

237
00:29:15,839 --> 00:29:17,924
and I'll personally write the citation.

238
00:29:20,176 --> 00:29:21,678
Hatcher.

239
00:29:21,761 --> 00:29:24,681
Jesus Christ.
What the hell are you doing back here?

240
00:29:24,764 --> 00:29:28,810
Thought I'd visit my mother, you know.
I'm retired now.

241
00:29:29,185 --> 00:29:31,146
- Retired, huh? Well, that's cozy.
- Yeah.

242
00:29:31,229 --> 00:29:32,439
So what the hell went down?

243
00:29:32,522 --> 00:29:34,315
Gee, I don't know.
What does it look like, Roselli?

244
00:29:34,399 --> 00:29:37,402
It's a shootout, Colombians,
what do you want me to say?

245
00:29:37,485 --> 00:29:39,821
Yeah, figures. Probably Tito Barco's clan.

246
00:29:39,904 --> 00:29:42,282
What would Tito Barco
be doing up this far?

247
00:29:42,365 --> 00:29:45,618
Losing. The turf is spreading out, Hatcher.

248
00:29:45,702 --> 00:29:48,288
The Jamaican posse is more organized
than these other players.

249
00:29:48,371 --> 00:29:50,373
They got more guns, more balls.

250
00:29:50,457 --> 00:29:53,001
Jimmy Fingers is giving them everything
from arms to legal protection.

251
00:29:53,084 --> 00:29:56,296
Jimmy Fingers, Jimmy Fingers,
ex-casino man out of Atlantic City.

252
00:29:56,379 --> 00:29:57,464
- Right.
- It's a piece of cake.

253
00:29:57,547 --> 00:29:59,549
- You pop him, you got it.
- Hey,

254
00:29:59,632 --> 00:30:01,134
why don't you help us out on this one?

255
00:30:01,217 --> 00:30:04,888
-'Cause I'm out. You know I'm out.
- Hey, come on, Hatcher. It's in the blood.

256
00:30:05,722 --> 00:30:07,807
If it's in the blood,
I'll get a transfusion, all right?

257
00:30:07,891 --> 00:30:09,809
Pardon me, Lieutenant.
May I see you for a moment?

258
00:30:09,893 --> 00:30:12,854
It seems the professor has found
something very interesting.

259
00:30:12,937 --> 00:30:16,524
- Charles, how you doing?
- We'll see you around, Hatcher.

260
00:30:16,900 --> 00:30:20,445
- The sign on the wall is Abakué.
- What, more of this voodoo bullshit?

261
00:30:20,528 --> 00:30:23,781
Professor, you call the markings
on the wall voodoo bullshit?

262
00:30:23,865 --> 00:30:27,785
Nope. Seen them in New York,
Los Angeles and now here.

263
00:30:27,869 --> 00:30:30,580
Sal, this is no bullshit, man.

264
00:30:30,663 --> 00:30:33,666
Those markings were put there
by a man named Screwface.

265
00:30:33,750 --> 00:30:36,294
You know what it means when we say
a man face is screwed?

266
00:30:36,377 --> 00:30:37,378
No.

267
00:30:37,462 --> 00:30:40,173
Well, I pray you never
have to find that out.

268
00:30:40,256 --> 00:30:42,050
Who's that?

269
00:30:43,343 --> 00:30:47,388
It's John Hatcher. He was an undercover
troubleshooter for the DEA.

270
00:30:47,472 --> 00:30:49,182
We worked together on one
a couple years ago.

271
00:30:49,265 --> 00:30:51,976
Yes, I know him. Him coming in with us?

272
00:30:52,060 --> 00:30:54,229
No, he thinks he's retired.

273
00:30:54,312 --> 00:30:56,606
He still looks functional to me.

274
00:31:21,798 --> 00:31:25,343
I have a message for you

275
00:31:25,426 --> 00:31:27,470
from Tito.

276
00:31:27,554 --> 00:31:31,558
Him say, meet him in hell!

277
00:32:17,145 --> 00:32:19,063
What up, dread?

278
00:32:20,773 --> 00:32:23,443
- Them let you out?
- Yes, man. No jail can hold me

279
00:32:23,526 --> 00:32:25,320
when Jimmy Fingers is on my side.

280
00:32:25,403 --> 00:32:27,071
Same.

281
00:32:27,155 --> 00:32:29,115
Jimmy Fingers.

282
00:32:29,198 --> 00:32:33,369
Give thanks for bringing out
my bredren. Same.

283
00:32:33,453 --> 00:32:37,081
Bondsman knew he was gonna skip,
so I figured I'd throw him a little extra.

284
00:32:37,999 --> 00:32:40,126
Hey, Monkey. Time for business.

285
00:32:40,209 --> 00:32:42,545
- Yeah, let's take care of this.
- Come.

286
00:33:05,568 --> 00:33:10,073
No, man. I just think you have
to take it one step at a time.

287
00:33:14,202 --> 00:33:17,121
No time in here. Nobody.
You know what I'm saying?

288
00:33:17,205 --> 00:33:19,832
- Me not joking, boy
- Yes, man, yes.

289
00:33:19,916 --> 00:33:22,335
Hold on, hold on. Listen up, you see.

290
00:33:22,418 --> 00:33:25,630
Our provider, the man of science, a come.

291
00:33:27,548 --> 00:33:30,426
Dreadlocks, Monkey be with us again.
That no good?

292
00:33:32,053 --> 00:33:34,180
And the magic be everywhere.

293
00:33:35,515 --> 00:33:37,141
- The warriors.
- Yes, sir.

294
00:33:37,225 --> 00:33:38,893
Conquerors.

295
00:33:38,976 --> 00:33:40,895
- Respect.
- Respect...

296
00:33:40,978 --> 00:33:43,690
The Almighty has given I and I his hand.

297
00:33:43,773 --> 00:33:45,942
His rod of correction I hold.

298
00:33:49,195 --> 00:33:52,990
Let no man here fear for his own life!

299
00:33:53,074 --> 00:33:57,870
Them that wish I and I to be left
in poverty and squalor

300
00:33:57,954 --> 00:34:00,456
will themselves be damned.

301
00:34:04,252 --> 00:34:06,838
If a man commit a crime against you,

302
00:34:08,631 --> 00:34:13,761
he must be paid back a thousand times!

303
00:34:16,514 --> 00:34:18,474
Who you fear?

304
00:34:19,517 --> 00:34:22,353
Him or me?

305
00:34:30,987 --> 00:34:36,325
Let no man here steer from
the path I have prepared!

306
00:34:41,789 --> 00:34:45,418
Them the streets out there
belong to you now!

307
00:34:47,962 --> 00:34:50,173
- Take it.
- Irie.

308
00:34:51,674 --> 00:34:54,927
- Take it!
- Take it!

309
00:34:55,011 --> 00:34:56,012
Yeah!

310
00:34:57,138 --> 00:34:58,556
- Go.
- Yes.

311
00:35:05,062 --> 00:35:08,274
I still don't believe you, man.
If you don't see

312
00:35:08,357 --> 00:35:11,277
the shit that's happening around us,
you're blind or you just don't want to see.

313
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:12,904
Maybe I've seen enough.

314
00:35:12,987 --> 00:35:14,947
Listen, man, I don't think the world
wants to change anyway.

315
00:35:15,031 --> 00:35:17,533
But things do change, man.

316
00:35:17,617 --> 00:35:20,495
Let me tell you something. It's like
you see this big dam with a leak in it.

317
00:35:20,578 --> 00:35:24,123
You plug it with your finger. Pretty
soon you see more holes, bigger ones.

318
00:35:24,207 --> 00:35:26,292
You plug it with your other fingers,
you plug it with your toes,

319
00:35:26,375 --> 00:35:27,627
you plug it with your tongue.

320
00:35:27,710 --> 00:35:30,755
But the water keeps on gushing out.
That's the way it is.

321
00:35:30,838 --> 00:35:33,299
Pretty soon, you quit or get killed.

322
00:35:33,382 --> 00:35:37,011
Five days later they got some
shit-bird cherry to take your place.

323
00:35:37,094 --> 00:35:39,680
They give him your shield
and you're forgotten about.

324
00:35:39,764 --> 00:35:41,599
The way I look at it, you come home,

325
00:35:41,682 --> 00:35:43,976
mind your own business,
watch your own yard.

326
00:35:44,060 --> 00:35:48,189
And then, if trouble finds you,
you go after it and you bite its head off,

327
00:35:48,272 --> 00:35:51,150
before it does the same thing to you. Huh?

328
00:35:51,234 --> 00:35:54,987
Look, Hatch, you haven't
been here in a long time.

329
00:35:55,071 --> 00:35:59,826
And I'm telling you, trouble is tapping
us both on the shoulder right now.

330
00:35:59,909 --> 00:36:02,829
- And you don't want to turn around.
- I hope you're wrong.

331
00:36:07,333 --> 00:36:11,420
- You look a little winded there, big guy.
- Give me a break. I'm on vacation.

332
00:36:11,504 --> 00:36:13,256
Tracey has something to show you.
She's been waiting.

333
00:36:38,447 --> 00:36:39,824
Get down!

334
00:36:55,756 --> 00:36:57,174
Johnny!

335
00:36:59,552 --> 00:37:03,389
They hurt my baby! No!

336
00:37:18,988 --> 00:37:23,075
Tracey is in serious condition
and she's unstable.

337
00:37:23,159 --> 00:37:27,079
There's pressure on the brain
that we'll have to relieve.

338
00:37:27,163 --> 00:37:31,626
- What does that mean?
- Surgery. I can't give you a prognosis.

339
00:37:31,709 --> 00:37:34,253
She's fighting for her life, and so are we.

340
00:37:40,092 --> 00:37:42,011
Let me tell you something, Doc.
You treat this girl like

341
00:37:42,094 --> 00:37:46,474
she's the President of the United States,
and money isn't a consideration.

342
00:37:46,557 --> 00:37:49,477
- We treat all of our patients exactly...
- Let me tell you something.

343
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:52,146
Like the President
of the United States, okay?

344
00:37:57,860 --> 00:38:00,571
Don't touch me, John. Don't touch me!

345
00:38:00,655 --> 00:38:03,157
This is your fault. Do you understand?

346
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:05,034
This is your fault.

347
00:38:05,326 --> 00:38:08,371
God damn you! God damn you!

348
00:38:08,454 --> 00:38:10,790
This is your fault, and my baby...

349
00:38:11,207 --> 00:38:12,458
My baby!

350
00:39:32,371 --> 00:39:33,539
Jimmy, how you doing, man?

351
00:39:33,622 --> 00:39:35,750
Hatcher, what the fuck are you doing here?

352
00:39:35,833 --> 00:39:39,587
Why don't you guys take a hike?
Go find another trick, all right?

353
00:39:41,881 --> 00:39:43,883
Let me tell you something.
You bailed out a Jamaican

354
00:39:43,966 --> 00:39:46,218
street named Monkey the other day.
I want him.

355
00:39:46,302 --> 00:39:49,430
This other piece of shit, Screwface?
I want him.

356
00:39:49,513 --> 00:39:52,266
Now I know you, you're a scumbag
and a puke. I don't mind that.

357
00:39:52,349 --> 00:39:54,185
You give me what I need,
I'm gonna leave here a nice guy.

358
00:39:54,268 --> 00:39:55,686
You don't, I'm gonna fuck you up.

359
00:39:55,770 --> 00:39:58,898
You fucking know better than that,
Hatcher. You know where the fuck...

360
00:40:01,317 --> 00:40:05,446
Come here. I just want to talk to you for
a minute. Come here, come here, look.

361
00:40:06,489 --> 00:40:07,948
The mob throws you out of Atlantic City,

362
00:40:08,032 --> 00:40:10,367
you come here, you're selling guns
to the Jamaicans, huh?

363
00:40:10,451 --> 00:40:13,245
Fucking sell anything to anybody, Hatcher,
except you, man.

364
00:40:13,329 --> 00:40:15,456
I won't sell you
the fucking sweat off my balls!

365
00:40:15,539 --> 00:40:17,541
- Is that right?
- Yeah.

366
00:40:20,294 --> 00:40:22,171
Watch it!

367
00:40:28,844 --> 00:40:31,055
You're a fucking dead man, Hatcher!
You hear me?

368
00:40:31,138 --> 00:40:33,057
- Yeah?
- I'm fucking Jimmy Fingers!

369
00:40:33,140 --> 00:40:34,725
I'm a made fucking man!

370
00:40:39,855 --> 00:40:41,315
God made men.

371
00:40:46,445 --> 00:40:48,781
All right, I want to know
where Screwface is.

372
00:40:48,864 --> 00:40:51,325
Screwface? Me don't know no Screwface.

373
00:40:51,408 --> 00:40:54,495
Really? That's strange.

374
00:40:56,038 --> 00:40:59,125
- Does that remind you?
- You just shoot me now, man!

375
00:40:59,208 --> 00:41:01,752
I got a better idea.
You're gonna go for a ride with me.

376
00:41:01,836 --> 00:41:03,754
And everybody's gonna see us together

377
00:41:03,838 --> 00:41:07,091
and Screwface is gonna find out
what good buddies we are.

378
00:41:09,218 --> 00:41:10,594
Come on.

379
00:41:13,389 --> 00:41:14,473
Let's go! Let's go!

380
00:41:14,557 --> 00:41:17,101
- All right, man. All right!
- Come on. Let's go!

381
00:41:19,145 --> 00:41:22,398
Just, easy. I will take you.

382
00:41:22,481 --> 00:41:25,109
Good. I want to get there
while I'm still young.

383
00:41:25,192 --> 00:41:27,945
Screwface give me a thousand deaths
worse than you do.

384
00:41:28,028 --> 00:41:31,824
- Yeah?
- Find him your fucking self!

385
00:41:58,517 --> 00:41:59,935
Well?

386
00:42:01,103 --> 00:42:04,690
One thought he was invincible,
the other thought he could fly.

387
00:42:05,191 --> 00:42:08,110
- So?
- They were both wrong.

388
00:42:14,325 --> 00:42:16,493
Go home. Stay behind the line.

389
00:42:18,245 --> 00:42:21,415
I want to know the second
that call comes in, okay?

390
00:42:21,832 --> 00:42:23,042
So?

391
00:42:23,125 --> 00:42:25,252
Two men are dead. This one was
shot one time in the forehead.

392
00:42:25,336 --> 00:42:27,880
The other one was forced
out the window up there.

393
00:42:27,963 --> 00:42:30,049
Did you find the hookers
who were in there?

394
00:42:30,132 --> 00:42:33,510
Sal, do you honestly believe that now
is the time for finding them hookers?

395
00:42:33,594 --> 00:42:35,888
- Look, this job was done by a pro.
- Is that right?

396
00:42:35,971 --> 00:42:38,807
That's right, and I'll bet my money
it was John Hatcher.

397
00:42:38,891 --> 00:42:42,895
- Now find me something.
- Sal, I will find you something.

398
00:42:42,978 --> 00:42:47,149
Look, he thinks he can do things his own
way, but I'll tell you something, he can't.

399
00:42:48,943 --> 00:42:51,320
Stay close to home, Charles.

400
00:42:52,488 --> 00:42:54,406
Do it, man. Do it.

401
00:43:13,175 --> 00:43:14,593
Where Nesta?

402
00:43:20,933 --> 00:43:23,143
Jimmy Fingers and Nesta
are not too good.

403
00:43:25,145 --> 00:43:28,649
Nesta dead? Who do it?
The white boy Hatcher?

404
00:43:46,333 --> 00:43:49,044
I want Hatcher dead!

405
00:43:50,796 --> 00:43:53,632
I want his family dead!

406
00:43:55,592 --> 00:43:58,470
And if you can't kill him,

407
00:43:58,554 --> 00:44:03,267
I go kill him, and then I go kill you.

408
00:44:54,860 --> 00:44:57,946
- What about protection for my family?
- They're assigned.

409
00:44:58,781 --> 00:45:02,117
- Good.
- I should probably have them tailing you.

410
00:45:03,285 --> 00:45:06,580
- What's that supposed to mean?
- Where were you last night?

411
00:45:06,663 --> 00:45:08,123
With a friend.

412
00:45:09,625 --> 00:45:11,126
Stay retired.

413
00:45:37,903 --> 00:45:39,113
Hello?

414
00:45:43,492 --> 00:45:46,829
Hi. I'm John Hatcher.
I saw you the other night.

415
00:45:48,122 --> 00:45:51,208
- Yes, at the Shamrock.
- Kind of need some help.

416
00:45:51,792 --> 00:45:53,877
Hold on. I'll be right down.

417
00:45:56,755 --> 00:45:58,966
The ideogram is an
African black magic symbol.

418
00:45:59,049 --> 00:46:02,594
It was used by the Jamaican drug gang
the other night.

419
00:46:02,678 --> 00:46:05,097
The FBI said I'd be getting photos today.

420
00:46:05,180 --> 00:46:07,516
I'm not with the FBI, you know.

421
00:46:09,143 --> 00:46:12,396
Well, the cow's tongue means
you've talked

422
00:46:12,479 --> 00:46:15,274
or exposed them
and have been marked for death.

423
00:46:15,357 --> 00:46:16,733
Where did you get these?

424
00:46:16,817 --> 00:46:21,363
I got these at my family's house
this morning.

425
00:46:23,866 --> 00:46:26,034
What about this black cross?

426
00:46:26,618 --> 00:46:30,914
This may seem ridiculous to you, Hatcher,
but these people are for real.

427
00:46:30,998 --> 00:46:33,125
Your family has been marked.

428
00:46:37,546 --> 00:46:40,340
- Could I use your phone for a minute?
- Yeah, sure.

429
00:46:54,438 --> 00:46:56,982
<i>- Hello?
- Yeah, it's me. ls everything all right?</i>

430
00:46:57,065 --> 00:47:01,236
Yeah, Johnny, I'm fine.
I just got back from the hospital.

431
00:47:01,320 --> 00:47:04,656
Mom's there with Tracey.
She's better. She's stable.

432
00:47:04,740 --> 00:47:06,325
I just had to come home
and get some rest.

433
00:47:06,408 --> 00:47:08,785
Listen. Go look out the window.
ls the guard still there?

434
00:47:11,163 --> 00:47:12,664
Just a minute.

435
00:47:18,295 --> 00:47:22,090
Yeah, the car's there,
but I don't see the guard.

436
00:47:24,009 --> 00:47:27,471
Johnny? Johnny?

437
00:47:29,806 --> 00:47:31,225
Oh, my God.

438
00:47:45,280 --> 00:47:47,658
No! No! Somebody help me!

439
00:47:48,700 --> 00:47:50,619
- No!No!
- Come on!

440
00:47:51,912 --> 00:47:54,581
- What do you want?
- I want you.

441
00:47:54,665 --> 00:47:55,999
What do you want?

442
00:47:56,083 --> 00:47:59,002
Just leave me alone. Somebody's coming.

443
00:47:59,086 --> 00:48:01,380
- You're making a big mistake.
- You're lying!

444
00:48:31,994 --> 00:48:35,414
Stop the bloodclot crying.

445
00:48:35,497 --> 00:48:38,333
- Everybody must dead.
- No.

446
00:48:39,167 --> 00:48:40,544
No, no.

447
00:48:41,962 --> 00:48:43,505
It's your turn.

448
00:48:54,558 --> 00:48:55,892
My father.

449
00:48:58,270 --> 00:49:01,648
I and I go take you to a place, you see,

450
00:49:03,025 --> 00:49:05,527
far, far away.

451
00:49:06,361 --> 00:49:08,530
You never been there before.

452
00:49:12,534 --> 00:49:14,161
You go there now.

453
00:49:22,252 --> 00:49:24,588
It's not your body me want, no.

454
00:49:25,380 --> 00:49:27,215
It's your dreams.

455
00:49:36,099 --> 00:49:38,101
No, you bastard!

456
00:49:40,687 --> 00:49:42,522
I own you now.

457
00:49:43,523 --> 00:49:46,276
- No!
- Now I have the power!

458
00:50:01,500 --> 00:50:05,045
Help me! Help me! Johnny, help me!

459
00:50:16,181 --> 00:50:20,227
He said... He said he'd be back.
He said he'd kill us both.

460
00:50:20,977 --> 00:50:24,648
Somehow, I don't think
he's gonna get the chance.

461
00:50:52,718 --> 00:50:55,095
I can't wait to nail this fucker.

462
00:50:55,554 --> 00:50:57,347
This is gonna be fun.

463
00:50:58,306 --> 00:50:59,683
Serious fun.

464
00:51:44,895 --> 00:51:46,521
Time to have fun.

465
00:52:05,207 --> 00:52:07,918
- What's happening, bredda?
- Irie, irie.

466
00:52:08,543 --> 00:52:10,962
- You want some blow?
- Yeah, I want some blow.

467
00:52:11,046 --> 00:52:13,423
Put your hands where I can see them
or I'm gonna blow your head off.

468
00:52:13,507 --> 00:52:16,218
Cool, now. Keep a cool head, man.

469
00:52:16,301 --> 00:52:17,928
- See them here?
- Right there. Right there.

470
00:52:18,595 --> 00:52:19,679
Hatch!

471
00:53:30,125 --> 00:53:31,459
Watch out!

472
00:54:32,562 --> 00:54:33,563
Shit!

473
00:55:19,234 --> 00:55:21,736
Take the right side! Take the right side!

474
00:55:21,820 --> 00:55:22,988
I got it! I got it!

475
00:55:27,742 --> 00:55:28,952
Shit!

476
00:55:34,082 --> 00:55:37,085
Say, boy! I'm gonna kill
your little bloodclot!

477
00:55:41,423 --> 00:55:43,133
You are a bloodclot!

478
00:55:43,550 --> 00:55:45,385
You are a bumbaclot.

479
00:55:47,637 --> 00:55:49,097
You go, raas.

480
00:55:52,767 --> 00:55:54,728
- Help me, please!
- Back off, boy!

481
00:55:54,811 --> 00:55:56,229
- Help me.
- Me say back off!

482
00:55:56,312 --> 00:55:58,398
You didn't hear me say?
You want her dead?

483
00:55:58,481 --> 00:55:59,733
Go ahead. Kill her.

484
00:55:59,816 --> 00:56:02,235
I don't know her. I don't care about her.

485
00:56:02,318 --> 00:56:05,363
I got you where I want you now.
You're just like a dog with no teeth.

486
00:56:05,447 --> 00:56:06,865
You want to kill her, kill her.

487
00:56:06,948 --> 00:56:10,410
I don't mind if you kill her, you know,
'cause I don't know her at all.

488
00:56:11,536 --> 00:56:15,874
Yeah, bad boy. Me a carve you, now, boy.
Me a carve you. Me a carve you.

489
00:56:15,957 --> 00:56:17,584
Me a carve blood...

490
00:56:28,094 --> 00:56:29,637
Run, dread, run!

491
00:56:38,897 --> 00:56:40,607
- What?
- Didn't you see it?

492
00:56:40,690 --> 00:56:42,901
From a bloodclot? What run for?

493
00:56:42,984 --> 00:56:46,237
A one white boy
against two bredda enough!

494
00:56:46,321 --> 00:56:51,409
Let's kick this little bloodclot
batty-hole, you see?

495
00:56:51,493 --> 00:56:52,660
I ready. You ready?

496
00:56:52,744 --> 00:56:54,079
Get him!

497
00:56:56,790 --> 00:56:58,500
Hold on. Hold on, now.

498
00:57:09,219 --> 00:57:10,929
Tear you, raasclot!

499
00:57:32,033 --> 00:57:34,828
You fuck with my family, you die.

500
00:57:43,878 --> 00:57:47,298
- Now we're talking serious fun.
- Abso-fucking-lutely.

501
00:57:59,602 --> 00:58:02,647
I've never met anyone
quite like you, Hatcher.

502
00:58:03,273 --> 00:58:05,108
Let me tell you something.
Go down to any soup kitchen

503
00:58:05,191 --> 00:58:07,443
and you're gonna find
a lot of guys just like me

504
00:58:07,527 --> 00:58:08,653
Why a soup kitchen?

505
00:58:08,736 --> 00:58:10,989
I'm just another unemployed guy,
you know.

506
00:58:11,072 --> 00:58:14,409
I don't think there is
a lot of guys like you anywhere.

507
00:58:14,492 --> 00:58:16,619
What's that supposed to mean?

508
00:58:17,495 --> 00:58:20,039
I finally met a guy who's nice,
not married, gay,

509
00:58:20,123 --> 00:58:24,252
or trying to find himself, and he's
trying very hard to get himself killed.

510
00:58:25,253 --> 00:58:28,381
Well, I have some unfinished business,
you know?

511
00:58:28,798 --> 00:58:32,635
And I was hoping that you'd maybe
give me some of your advice.

512
00:58:33,094 --> 00:58:36,764
- What are you planning to do?
- I want to take out the posse.

513
00:58:39,517 --> 00:58:41,561
Then destroy their system.

514
00:58:41,644 --> 00:58:45,690
When Screwface kills, he wants everyone
to see he did it or know that he ordered it.

515
00:58:45,773 --> 00:58:48,526
That way he's both feared and worshiped.

516
00:58:50,069 --> 00:58:54,032
You'd have to kill him, so the posse
thinks you've taken his power.

517
00:58:54,115 --> 00:58:56,868
That way they will believe
your magic is bigger.

518
00:58:56,951 --> 00:59:00,955
Otherwise, they'll never stop
until you and your family are dead.

519
01:00:44,684 --> 01:00:47,103
I want you to meet my sister.

520
01:00:51,107 --> 01:00:53,109
Goddess of fire.

521
01:01:06,039 --> 01:01:08,499
Come on, God damn it!

522
01:01:59,801 --> 01:02:01,177
Yeah, well, this is what you ordered.

523
01:02:01,260 --> 01:02:03,930
Do you want anything else?
Wires, surveillance?

524
01:02:04,013 --> 01:02:07,141
- No. Just firearms this time.
- Okay, you got it.

525
01:02:07,225 --> 01:02:09,018
- For you.
- Thank you.

526
01:02:11,354 --> 01:02:14,816
- You still sober?
- Yeah, five years, man. One day at a time.

527
01:02:15,942 --> 01:02:17,693
- Stay away from that Nembutal.
- You got it.

528
01:02:27,120 --> 01:02:28,621
Hang on. Hang on.

529
01:02:42,677 --> 01:02:45,346
Max, meet Charles. Charles, meet Max.

530
01:02:51,519 --> 01:02:55,690
Man, I've been after Screwface
for five long years, you see?

531
01:02:55,773 --> 01:02:58,234
I have followed him from Kingston to here.

532
01:02:58,317 --> 01:03:01,654
- All around!
- You break my heart, man.

533
01:03:01,737 --> 01:03:03,948
Your tactics are just making him
tougher to snatch up.

534
01:03:04,031 --> 01:03:06,117
Him jump already, you know.

535
01:03:09,203 --> 01:03:13,207
And it's only I who can guide you
to what it is you seek.

536
01:03:14,584 --> 01:03:17,378
I don't know if that would be
a very wise career move for you.

537
01:03:17,462 --> 01:03:22,049
Come on! Look close!
Who you think me work for, the DEA?

538
01:03:22,133 --> 01:03:25,720
I'm a Jamaican cop, man,
and Screwface is my career!

539
01:03:25,803 --> 01:03:27,388
Look, man, I don't really care
who you work for.

540
01:03:27,472 --> 01:03:29,807
You got your reasons and I got mine.

541
01:03:37,023 --> 01:03:39,525
Screwface has gone back to Jamaica.

542
01:03:45,531 --> 01:03:49,785
You know, Charles,
sometimes three's not a crowd.

543
01:03:50,953 --> 01:03:53,581
Way I look at it, we need each other.

544
01:03:54,957 --> 01:03:56,584
Know what I mean?

545
01:04:05,301 --> 01:04:06,886
Let's do it, man.

546
01:05:02,567 --> 01:05:03,818
- How you doing?
- Okay.

547
01:05:03,901 --> 01:05:05,361
Care package.

548
01:05:11,617 --> 01:05:13,619
Uncle Sam's contribution?

549
01:05:15,162 --> 01:05:17,373
Welfare for warfare, you know.

550
01:05:39,437 --> 01:05:41,439
This is my silent partner.

551
01:05:43,149 --> 01:05:47,528
A whisper in your ear from this girl goes
a long way, you know what I'm saying?

552
01:06:02,084 --> 01:06:03,502
You guys didn't hear a thing, did you?

553
01:06:03,586 --> 01:06:05,671
All right, you heard the slide
click a little, right?

554
01:06:05,755 --> 01:06:07,381
Massive cool.

555
01:06:08,758 --> 01:06:10,134
Forward, Jamaica.

556
01:07:05,272 --> 01:07:09,110
These are the streets that breed
the Screwfaces of the world.

557
01:07:09,193 --> 01:07:13,948
This is the first time I ever got the idea
it's not all sunshine and bikinis.

558
01:07:14,031 --> 01:07:15,533
I owe you an apology, man,

559
01:07:15,616 --> 01:07:18,953
because until today I thought
all Jamaicans were dope-dealing dreads.

560
01:07:19,036 --> 01:07:21,997
No, man. Don't feel you have
to apologize for nothing, man.

561
01:07:22,081 --> 01:07:23,916
Man, these streets are hard out here,

562
01:07:23,999 --> 01:07:26,961
and some people make a bad choice,
that's all.

563
01:07:27,336 --> 01:07:29,171
They say life is hard.

564
01:08:14,091 --> 01:08:16,093
- What up, man?
- Nothing now.

565
01:08:16,177 --> 01:08:17,845
What you doing all the way up here?

566
01:08:17,928 --> 01:08:21,140
You're not having enough trouble
in Kingston, peace boy?

567
01:08:21,223 --> 01:08:23,851
Back with country, boy. You do your duty?

568
01:08:25,853 --> 01:08:27,146
Pay him.

569
01:08:32,651 --> 01:08:36,322
This girl, she hang with Screwface
more time.

570
01:08:36,864 --> 01:08:40,701
They always partying together.
Can usually find her at Cat Club.

571
01:08:41,202 --> 01:08:44,663
<i>Heebie-jeebie, wicked boy
your time has come</i>

572
01:08:44,914 --> 01:08:48,167
<i>You don't live right

573
01:08:49,210 --> 01:08:52,713
<i>Jankrow a go nyam your supper soon, boy</i>

574
01:08:52,797 --> 01:08:56,300
<i>Jankrow a go lead the children astray</i>

575
01:08:56,383 --> 01:08:59,970
<i>Jankrow a go meet the retribution</i>

576
01:09:00,054 --> 01:09:03,349
<i>Justice has finally find a way</i>

577
01:09:05,226 --> 01:09:09,146
<i>Screwface, you know
that your time has come</i>

578
01:09:09,230 --> 01:09:12,733
<i>You don't do right, you gonna dead tonight</i>

579
01:09:12,817 --> 01:09:16,362
<i>So now a go take you down
the road to doom</i>

580
01:09:16,445 --> 01:09:20,491
<i>And, jankrow, a go nyam

581
01:09:20,574 --> 01:09:24,078

582
01:09:24,161 --> 01:09:27,665
<i>Jankrow a go lead the children astray</i>

583
01:09:27,748 --> 01:09:31,252
<i>Jankrow a go meet the retribution</i>

584
01:09:31,335 --> 01:09:35,047
<i>Justice has finally find the way</i>

585
01:09:37,758 --> 01:09:41,178
<i>Are you worried
it's just a wolf in sheep's clothing</i>

586
01:09:41,262 --> 01:09:44,640
<i>Trying to lead the children astray?</i>

587
01:09:44,723 --> 01:09:48,352
<i>But don't you know our 'ope it brighten?</i>

588
01:09:48,435 --> 01:09:51,939
<i>Take my hands, I will show you the way</i>

589
01:09:52,022 --> 01:09:55,276
<i>Jankrow a go nyam your supper soon, boy</i>

590
01:09:55,359 --> 01:09:59,029
<i>Jankrow a go lead the children astray</i>

591
01:09:59,113 --> 01:10:02,408
<i>Jankrow a go meet the retribution</i>

592
01:10:02,491 --> 01:10:06,328
<i>Justice has finally find a way</i>

593
01:10:08,581 --> 01:10:09,915
Screwface?

594
01:10:12,751 --> 01:10:14,670
Road to doom.

595
01:10:15,588 --> 01:10:18,215
Sounds like you know this guy
pretty well.

596
01:10:18,299 --> 01:10:21,135
Yeah, I know him. I partied with him.

597
01:10:22,303 --> 01:10:26,140
I don't care him sell the drugs.
It's part of doing business.

598
01:10:26,974 --> 01:10:28,893
But my sister,

599
01:10:28,976 --> 01:10:31,562
she lost a shipment, and him cut her dead.

600
01:10:31,645 --> 01:10:36,150
And for that, somehow, someday,
him a go dust off.

601
01:10:37,026 --> 01:10:39,737
Yeah, so why don't you just tell me
what I gotta know,

602
01:10:39,820 --> 01:10:41,488
and I'll go do what I gotta do?

603
01:10:45,910 --> 01:10:52,583
Screwface have two head and four eyes.
And that is the secret to his magic.

604
01:11:29,495 --> 01:11:32,039
Look upon this madman.

605
01:11:33,874 --> 01:11:37,711
Him dead and him don't even know it.

606
01:16:10,359 --> 01:16:12,402
Get away from the window!

607
01:16:41,515 --> 01:16:43,267
I got it! I got it! Don't worry. I got it!

608
01:18:18,779 --> 01:18:20,947
Welcome to I island.

609
01:18:21,448 --> 01:18:22,783
Fuck you.

610
01:18:25,285 --> 01:18:26,495
You a woman?

611
01:18:26,578 --> 01:18:30,791
Me know what you is.
You is a dog after a bone!

612
01:18:31,208 --> 01:18:33,251
And you have no teeth!

613
01:18:43,970 --> 01:18:45,305
