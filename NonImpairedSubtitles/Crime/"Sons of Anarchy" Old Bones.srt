3
00:00:18,769 --> 00:00:22,689
Hold it. Hold it.
Hold it. Just wait.

4
00:00:22,773 --> 00:00:25,358
Holy shit.

5
00:00:37,705 --> 00:00:40,540
Appreciate the lift.
No problem.

6
00:00:40,666 --> 00:00:43,710
Where's the Cutlass?
Oh, it's at the hospital.

7
00:00:43,794 --> 00:00:45,795
Still not running right?

8
00:00:47,756 --> 00:00:49,757
It's running okay.

9
00:00:51,802 --> 00:00:53,761
This worry I'm getting here,

10
00:00:53,846 --> 00:00:57,306
that have anything to do with that
car that's been following us?

11
00:00:57,391 --> 00:01:00,476
The compact parked
halfway down the block.

12
00:01:09,194 --> 00:01:11,112
Tara!

13
00:01:11,196 --> 00:01:13,197
What the hell's going on?

14
00:01:18,203 --> 00:01:22,540
That A.T.F. agent that's
been looking into you guys—

15
00:01:22,666 --> 00:01:26,210
I think he's here for me.
What are you talking about?

16
00:01:26,295 --> 00:01:29,255
I was with him in Chicago.

17
00:01:29,339 --> 00:01:33,176
It got violent. I tried to end it.
He started stalking me.

18
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:39,974
- Jax. Don't. He's dangerous.
- Go back inside, Tara.

19
00:01:40,058 --> 00:01:41,851
Lock the door.

20
00:01:47,608 --> 00:01:50,276
Vandalism. Deadly weapon.

21
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:52,320
That's six months
in County, asshole.

22
00:01:52,404 --> 00:01:55,198
Violating a restraining order.
You'll be in the cell next to me.

23
00:01:55,282 --> 00:01:57,700
They teach you how to
suck a dick in A.T.F. school?

24
00:01:58,869 --> 00:02:00,828
Badass biker.

25
00:02:00,913 --> 00:02:03,331
You guys gave it your best shot.

26
00:02:03,415 --> 00:02:05,541
You got nothing on Sam Crow.

27
00:02:05,626 --> 00:02:08,211
And you harassing Tara,
that ends here,

28
00:02:08,295 --> 00:02:11,380
or next time it won't be a piece-of-shit car
I'm draining fluid from.

29
00:02:11,465 --> 00:02:13,883
You threatening a federal agent?

30
00:02:13,967 --> 00:02:16,344
I'm threatening you.

31
00:02:16,428 --> 00:02:19,430
Go away.
It's my last warning.

32
00:02:26,021 --> 00:02:29,440
You better rein in
your A.T.F. boyfriend.

33
00:02:29,525 --> 00:02:31,859
Agent Kohn isn't on my payroll.
I don't keep tabs.

34
00:02:31,944 --> 00:02:33,945
Yeah, well,
maybe you should.

35
00:02:34,029 --> 00:02:35,947
He's not here
for Sam Crow, Hale.

36
00:02:36,073 --> 00:02:38,491
He's here for Tara.
What the hell
are you talking about?

37
00:02:38,575 --> 00:02:41,244
This guy was
stalking her in Chicago.

38
00:02:41,328 --> 00:02:43,329
Thinks she came back
to Charming to be with me.

39
00:02:43,413 --> 00:02:47,416
I'm telling you, this guy is nuts,
and he's gonna hurt her.

40
00:02:47,501 --> 00:02:50,795
Jesus Christ. That's who she had
a restraining order against.

41
00:02:50,921 --> 00:02:54,590
You knew?
No, but it makes sense now.

42
00:02:54,675 --> 00:02:57,844
Hale! Let's go, hotshot.

43
00:02:57,928 --> 00:03:01,389
Water and Powerjust dug up
some old bones out on 44.

44
00:03:01,473 --> 00:03:03,057
Be there in a minute.

45
00:03:06,270 --> 00:03:08,604
Kohn is my problem.

46
00:03:08,689 --> 00:03:10,690
I will handle it.

47
00:03:10,774 --> 00:03:13,109
You better, man,
or I'm gonna.

48
00:03:18,156 --> 00:03:21,534
- Half-Sack, boombaye! Get in there, kid!
- Hands up, Lowell.

49
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:24,495
Keep your hands up, Lowell.
Now you're getting cocky.

50
00:03:24,580 --> 00:03:28,583
Anyone can beat up a junkie,
prospect. It doesn't mean shit.

51
00:03:28,667 --> 00:03:31,210
Where did you learn
how to fight like this?

52
00:03:31,295 --> 00:03:33,921
You know, I was junior
lightweight champion.

53
00:03:34,006 --> 00:03:37,675
- Armed Forces boxing competition.
- Ooh, that's so hot.

54
00:03:39,219 --> 00:03:41,721
Things all better
with the little missus now?

55
00:03:41,805 --> 00:03:44,432
My balls are still attached.

56
00:03:48,061 --> 00:03:50,354
Shit, Lowell.
Get out ofthere.

57
00:03:50,439 --> 00:03:53,441
- Whose idea was this?
- Tig's.
- Bobby's.

58
00:03:53,525 --> 00:03:56,736
I don't mind it, Clay.
I'm just helping the Half-Sack train.

59
00:03:56,820 --> 00:03:58,905
Yeah, well, you killed
enough brain cells.

60
00:03:58,989 --> 00:04:02,992
- Come on. Come on. Back to work.
- Okay. Thanks.

61
00:04:04,745 --> 00:04:08,497
How's he doing?
Well, the latest round of
rehab seems to be sticking.

62
00:04:08,582 --> 00:04:10,583
He hasn't missed any work.

63
00:04:10,667 --> 00:04:14,128
If I could get A.A. to kick up a vig,
Lowell could make us all rich.

64
00:04:14,212 --> 00:04:19,634
He's always been a freak.
Damn good mechanic though.
I guess you taught him that.

65
00:04:19,718 --> 00:04:22,887
How's Sugar Ray One Nut
looking?

66
00:04:22,971 --> 00:04:25,014
He's working fast.
Got a great right hook.

67
00:04:25,098 --> 00:04:28,225
How much money
gets thrown around
at these bare-fist things?

68
00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:31,604
The purse is okay, but it's
the betting that's gone crazy.

69
00:04:31,688 --> 00:04:34,941
I know a couple of guys last year
who made six figures each.

70
00:04:35,025 --> 00:04:37,443
- Really?
- The prospect can knock any one
ofthose lightweights out...

71
00:04:37,569 --> 00:04:39,570
any day ofthe week.
Absolutely.

72
00:04:39,655 --> 00:04:44,075
- What'd we pull together for McKeevy?
- A hundred and 20.

73
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:47,286
You ain't thinking
about betting on the prospect.

74
00:04:47,371 --> 00:04:49,538
If Half-Sack takes
his first five fights...

75
00:04:49,623 --> 00:04:51,749
and looks strong
going into the finish,

76
00:04:51,833 --> 00:04:54,669
we control how it ends,
it could be a huge payday.

77
00:04:54,753 --> 00:04:58,422
- What do you think?
- I don't know.

78
00:04:58,507 --> 00:05:02,134
But I do know there's no way we're
raising 80 grand in the next four days,

79
00:05:02,219 --> 00:05:05,054
so it might be our only shot.

80
00:05:07,182 --> 00:05:09,058
- I'm in.
- I'm in. Done.

81
00:05:10,435 --> 00:05:13,062
- All right, I'm in.
- Take 50 grand.

82
00:05:13,146 --> 00:05:15,189
I wanna see it triple.
You're gonna train him.

83
00:05:15,273 --> 00:05:18,317
No booze. No weed.
No pussy.

84
00:05:18,402 --> 00:05:21,278
That include
the Nevada sweetbutt?

85
00:05:21,363 --> 00:05:25,491
Till I'm up a hundred-K, that little
cherry tart can cool on the counter.

86
00:05:25,617 --> 00:05:27,952
- Let's go. Hit that bag.
- Hey, Bobby.

87
00:05:28,078 --> 00:05:30,579
What?
Do me a favor.

88
00:05:30,664 --> 00:05:32,873
Push up on that thing, will ya?

89
00:05:33,875 --> 00:05:35,835
- Really?
- Really.

90
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:37,920
Halfy-Sack is
all about that now.

91
00:05:38,005 --> 00:05:41,090
Well, I wanna see if she's all about him.
And go at it hard.

92
00:05:43,135 --> 00:05:46,429
- I ain't mad at that.
- Half-Sack's gonna lose his mind.

93
00:05:46,513 --> 00:05:49,306
Well, that kind of anger
we can really use.

94
00:05:49,391 --> 00:05:52,852
Hey, and call Unser.
See if he wants in on
some ofthis fight action.

95
00:05:52,936 --> 00:05:54,979
Clay, he's out on the job.

96
00:05:55,063 --> 00:05:58,065
Water and Power dug up
some old bones this morning.

97
00:05:58,191 --> 00:06:00,776
Where?
Out on 44.

98
00:06:02,779 --> 00:06:04,655
What?

99
00:06:06,742 --> 00:06:08,743
I don't know.

100
00:06:12,706 --> 00:06:16,083
- Wheeling out two bodies.
- There should be three.

101
00:06:16,168 --> 00:06:18,544
I'm afraid to ask.

102
00:06:18,628 --> 00:06:20,671
Don't be. There it is.

103
00:06:21,673 --> 00:06:23,841
Is this us?

104
00:06:26,178 --> 00:06:28,179
Yeah.

105
00:06:31,183 --> 00:06:33,184
Aw, shit.

106
00:07:13,141 --> 00:07:15,392
And all three ofthem
were Mayans?

107
00:07:15,477 --> 00:07:17,603
Yep. Back in '92,

108
00:07:17,687 --> 00:07:22,274
Mexicans tried to expand their Oakland
dope base, set up a charter in Lodi.

109
00:07:22,359 --> 00:07:24,318
We couldn't let that happen.

110
00:07:24,402 --> 00:07:26,654
It was a bloody two years.
Bodies dropped.

111
00:07:26,738 --> 00:07:28,739
Yeah. I remember.

112
00:07:28,824 --> 00:07:31,075
That was right around
the time my old man died.

113
00:07:31,159 --> 00:07:35,121
- That's right.
- We got to stop the P.D.
from I.D.'ing those bodies.

114
00:07:35,205 --> 00:07:37,748
If they flag the Mayans,
we're their next stop.

115
00:07:37,833 --> 00:07:41,710
Well, we can pull teeth to stop the I.D.,
but they can still D.N.A. test.

116
00:07:41,795 --> 00:07:43,921
Forensic tests on three bodies?

117
00:07:44,005 --> 00:07:46,966
That would blow half
of Unser's yearly budget.

118
00:07:47,050 --> 00:07:49,051
But if Hale thought
it would hurt us,

119
00:07:49,136 --> 00:07:50,928
he'd get his new fed buddies
to float the costs.

120
00:07:51,012 --> 00:07:53,013
Shit, man, that was pre-O.J., right?

121
00:07:53,098 --> 00:07:56,517
We weren't thinking
about D.N.A. back in '93.

122
00:07:56,601 --> 00:07:59,103
What kind of clues we got buried
with those Mexicans?

123
00:07:59,187 --> 00:08:01,480
If they don't know they're Mayans,
they won't take it any farther.

124
00:08:01,565 --> 00:08:05,860
We stop the identification,
we stop the investigation.

125
00:08:13,785 --> 00:08:18,455
So, uh, there's
a 1 5K purse on the line...

126
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:20,499
and a lot of ringside action.

127
00:08:20,584 --> 00:08:22,501
Yeah. I'm ready.

128
00:08:22,586 --> 00:08:24,670
This ain't no army boxing, kid.
This is street brawling.

129
00:08:24,754 --> 00:08:27,381
No. It's cool.

130
00:08:28,717 --> 00:08:30,509
Cherry pie.

131
00:08:30,635 --> 00:08:33,012
What?
It's time to go.

132
00:08:33,096 --> 00:08:35,306
What are you talking about?
Go where?

133
00:08:35,390 --> 00:08:37,892
- What are you doing, Bobby?
- Relax, prospect.

134
00:08:37,976 --> 00:08:40,811
- She's gonna stay with him till the fight.
- No, I'm not.

135
00:08:40,937 --> 00:08:42,938
Oh, yeah, you are.
Why?

136
00:08:43,023 --> 00:08:45,858
No booze.
No dope.

137
00:08:45,942 --> 00:08:48,527
- No pussy.
- You'll love my place. It's very cozy.

138
00:08:48,653 --> 00:08:50,613
Get your hands off me.
Quarantine.

139
00:08:50,739 --> 00:08:52,198
Back off.

140
00:08:52,282 --> 00:08:56,493
Clay, no sex before a fight's
like an old wives thing.

141
00:08:56,578 --> 00:08:58,871
Did—

142
00:08:58,955 --> 00:09:01,498
Did you just insult
my old lady again?

143
00:09:01,583 --> 00:09:03,626
No. I—

144
00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:05,794
Jump.

145
00:09:14,846 --> 00:09:18,390
Why didn't you tell me
it was Kohn?

146
00:09:18,475 --> 00:09:20,643
Jax told you?

147
00:09:20,727 --> 00:09:23,646
I did not know that Kohn
was the guy that was stalking you.

148
00:09:23,772 --> 00:09:27,691
I could have—
You know, I tried
getting help in Chicago.

149
00:09:27,776 --> 00:09:30,486
Complained to his superiors-
Made things worse.

150
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:34,657
I went through three precincts
before someone would even
give me that restraining order.

151
00:09:34,783 --> 00:09:37,660
I doubted you
could do anything.
Tara.

152
00:09:41,456 --> 00:09:44,625
Kohn's boss doesn't
even know that he is here.

153
00:09:44,709 --> 00:09:47,544
This guy is in deep shit.

154
00:09:47,671 --> 00:09:50,422
He is done.
Really?

155
00:09:50,507 --> 00:09:54,385
He is leaving Charming.
I promise.

156
00:09:54,469 --> 00:09:56,637
And I am sorry.

157
00:10:01,893 --> 00:10:06,021
Town's talking about the skulls
that rolled out ofthat hole.
I'm sure they are.

158
00:10:06,106 --> 00:10:08,983
Have you thought
about damage control?

159
00:10:09,067 --> 00:10:11,068
Tig's the only one
that knows the truth.

160
00:10:11,152 --> 00:10:13,487
Everybody else thinks
all those bodies are Mayans.

161
00:10:13,613 --> 00:10:16,282
And how do you stop
that truth from spreading?
I've got it covered.

162
00:10:16,366 --> 00:10:18,367
All right?
Don't worry.

163
00:10:18,451 --> 00:10:20,995
This shit stays
in the rearview.

164
00:10:29,838 --> 00:10:31,797
So I talked to Trammel.

165
00:10:31,881 --> 00:10:34,049
The Sanwa County coroner's
clearing space,

166
00:10:34,134 --> 00:10:36,677
but bones stay local tonight.

167
00:10:36,761 --> 00:10:40,723
Good. Now I have to get into
the lower level ofthe hospital.

168
00:10:40,807 --> 00:10:46,520
You, uh, think the old squeeze
might be able to hook a brother up?

169
00:10:46,646 --> 00:10:48,731
I'll see what I can do.
All right.

170
00:10:50,108 --> 00:10:53,068
Sorry. Clay? I, uh—
I just asked Gemma.

171
00:10:53,153 --> 00:10:55,988
Wanted to make sure it was cool
with you that I have Moby here.

172
00:10:56,072 --> 00:10:59,033
Only during my break.
He— He likes to watch me work.

173
00:10:59,117 --> 00:11:01,243
Sure. It's fine.

174
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:11,086
Hey, Lowell,
you're doing good work.

175
00:11:12,422 --> 00:11:14,923
Thanks, man!

176
00:11:22,015 --> 00:11:24,391
All right.
Tara's not here.

177
00:11:24,517 --> 00:11:27,102
What do you wanna do?
Lab coat on the chair.

178
00:11:27,228 --> 00:11:30,856
Can you distract
the doctors?
Yeah. No problem.

179
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:32,524
Excuse me, ladies.

180
00:11:32,609 --> 00:11:35,986
Oh. How you doing?
Uh, you're doctors, both ofyou?

181
00:11:36,112 --> 00:11:38,155
Yeah.
Oh, thank God.

182
00:11:38,281 --> 00:11:41,784
Um, a Doberman pinscher
took a chunk.
Ah, Jesus.

183
00:11:41,868 --> 00:11:44,453
Hang on. A chunk of my ass.
I— Can we-

184
00:11:44,537 --> 00:11:46,580
You need to go
to the E.R.

185
00:11:46,664 --> 00:11:49,625
Distract them.
I said distract them,
not scar 'em for life.

186
00:11:49,709 --> 00:11:51,710
Shit. I'm serious.
I think it's infected.

187
00:11:51,795 --> 00:11:55,172
Orderly to the nurses' station.

188
00:11:55,256 --> 00:11:57,466
Orderly to the nurses' station.

189
00:12:04,391 --> 00:12:06,392
Hey.

190
00:12:08,144 --> 00:12:10,396
Managed to steal a key card
from an intern.

191
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:12,481
Hopefully it gets us below.

192
00:12:12,565 --> 00:12:14,566
Yeah. Me and Tig'll take care ofthis.

193
00:12:14,651 --> 00:12:17,361
Why don't you stay here
and run interference.

194
00:12:17,445 --> 00:12:19,363
Why?

195
00:12:19,489 --> 00:12:21,448
Hey, Doc.
Hey.

196
00:12:21,574 --> 00:12:24,618
Kid looks strong, huh?
Yeah.

197
00:12:27,455 --> 00:12:29,665
Well, you have
a good night, all right?

198
00:12:29,749 --> 00:12:32,668
You too.

199
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:37,923
Nurse said you wanted to see me.

200
00:12:38,007 --> 00:12:41,593
Yeah. I was just checking in.
You okay?

201
00:12:41,678 --> 00:12:45,097
Yeah. I talked to Hale.
He assured me Joshua was leaving.

202
00:12:46,808 --> 00:12:49,351
Thanks for handling that.

203
00:12:49,436 --> 00:12:51,437
Ah, you're welcome.

204
00:12:51,521 --> 00:12:54,898
You won't have to worry
about that guy anymore.

205
00:14:02,133 --> 00:14:04,676
I'll find us some gloves.
Okay.

206
00:14:19,234 --> 00:14:21,360
Hey, freako.

207
00:14:21,444 --> 00:14:23,445
We ain't here
to find you a date.

208
00:14:23,530 --> 00:14:27,282
I know. I know.
It's just— You know.

209
00:14:27,367 --> 00:14:29,368
You ever?

210
00:14:30,453 --> 00:14:33,372
What? Cold pack?
Yeah.

211
00:14:33,456 --> 00:14:35,832
Nah. Not my thing.

212
00:14:35,917 --> 00:14:37,918
I know it's a little
bit creepy at first,

213
00:14:38,002 --> 00:14:42,089
but then something happens,
man, I'm telling you.

214
00:14:42,173 --> 00:14:46,134
This soothing coldness.
This stillness.

215
00:14:46,261 --> 00:14:48,220
It's really a beautiful thing.
Please.

216
00:14:48,304 --> 00:14:50,430
Please, stop.

217
00:14:53,851 --> 00:14:57,729
Goddamn it. It's all right.
Keep looking.

218
00:14:59,357 --> 00:15:01,692
I thought I told you
to wait upstairs.

219
00:15:01,776 --> 00:15:03,735
Well, there's
no interference to run,

220
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:06,071
and I figured you could use
the extra pair of hands.

221
00:15:06,155 --> 00:15:08,323
Is that all right?

222
00:15:08,408 --> 00:15:10,742
I got 'em.

223
00:15:10,827 --> 00:15:12,828
All three.

224
00:15:16,833 --> 00:15:20,043
Hold the head. Tight.

225
00:15:22,005 --> 00:15:24,131
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

226
00:15:24,215 --> 00:15:26,216
It's already been I.D.'d.

227
00:15:33,808 --> 00:15:36,059
Lowell Harlan Sr.

228
00:15:39,939 --> 00:15:42,691
This is Lowell's old man.

229
00:15:49,032 --> 00:15:51,033
Cookie time.

230
00:15:52,702 --> 00:15:54,703
I made 'em.

231
00:15:56,289 --> 00:15:59,541
Especially for you.
No, thank you.

232
00:16:08,635 --> 00:16:10,552
Stop, please.

233
00:16:10,637 --> 00:16:12,638
Come on, girl.

234
00:16:14,223 --> 00:16:16,391
You ain't no old lady yet.

235
00:16:17,769 --> 00:16:21,355
You—

236
00:16:21,439 --> 00:16:23,565
do this for me—

237
00:16:24,901 --> 00:16:28,904
I'll make sure you get
the thumbs-up from Clay.

238
00:16:30,323 --> 00:16:32,616
Stop, 'kay? Please.
Come on.

239
00:16:32,742 --> 00:16:35,202
Stop! God.

240
00:16:35,286 --> 00:16:37,371
I'm not a sweetbutt.

241
00:16:37,497 --> 00:16:39,831
Oh, yeah, you are.
No, I'm not.

242
00:16:39,916 --> 00:16:42,626
I came here for Kip. I'm not gonna be
passed around anymore. All right?

243
00:16:42,752 --> 00:16:44,670
I'm done with that.
Come on.

244
00:16:44,796 --> 00:16:46,963
Seriously. Ew!

245
00:16:47,048 --> 00:16:49,091
Oh, Jesus.

246
00:17:00,645 --> 00:17:02,646
Okay.

247
00:17:04,857 --> 00:17:09,486
- Okay?
- I said okay.

248
00:17:14,033 --> 00:17:16,576
Relax.
Have a cookie.

249
00:17:16,661 --> 00:17:20,163
Why was Lowell's dad
buried with the enemy?

250
00:17:20,248 --> 00:17:22,165
Casualty ofwar.

251
00:17:22,291 --> 00:17:24,543
Mayans took him out.
He worked at T.M.

252
00:17:24,669 --> 00:17:27,170
He wasn't patched.
Mayans went after everybody.

253
00:17:27,255 --> 00:17:29,256
Family, friends.
Didn't matter.

254
00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:31,591
Lowell thinks his dad just split.

255
00:17:31,676 --> 00:17:34,511
Poor bastard's convinced
he's still out there.

256
00:17:34,595 --> 00:17:36,596
I know.

257
00:17:36,681 --> 00:17:38,807
So why the same grave?

258
00:17:38,891 --> 00:17:41,393
Disrespect.

259
00:17:41,477 --> 00:17:43,562
I know.

260
00:17:43,646 --> 00:17:45,605
It was a crazy two years.

261
00:17:45,690 --> 00:17:47,899
I didn't have time to think
a lot of shit through.

262
00:17:47,984 --> 00:17:52,612
Is that why you didn't want me
in the morgue? Protect that secret?

263
00:17:54,866 --> 00:17:56,867
I got no secrets from you.

264
00:18:00,371 --> 00:18:03,874
You know,
with the Mayans I.D.'d too,

265
00:18:03,958 --> 00:18:07,294
I can only imagine the poison
Hale's gonna pour in Lowell's ear.

266
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:09,546
I'll handle Lowell.

267
00:18:23,311 --> 00:18:25,437
Sounds good.

268
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:32,986
Is it cool if I work on it
before my shift?

269
00:18:33,070 --> 00:18:35,071
Yeah.

270
00:18:39,702 --> 00:18:42,496
Is everything okay, man?

271
00:18:43,998 --> 00:18:46,583
I want you
to hear this from me.
What?

272
00:18:46,709 --> 00:18:50,754
Something happen to Moby?
I left him with Anita.
No, no, no. Your kid's fine.

273
00:18:54,717 --> 00:18:59,513
Those bodies they, uh,
pulled out ofthe hole on 44—

274
00:19:03,309 --> 00:19:05,393
one of 'em's your old man.

275
00:19:07,230 --> 00:19:10,398
My dad?

276
00:19:12,735 --> 00:19:15,070
Oh, that—
that don't make sense.

277
00:19:17,865 --> 00:19:20,534
I'm sorry, son.

278
00:19:22,662 --> 00:19:26,790
No. He ran off
when I was, like, 1 5.

279
00:19:26,874 --> 00:19:31,586
He just split. Everyone told me that.
You told me that.

280
00:19:33,297 --> 00:19:36,758
I know.

281
00:19:40,930 --> 00:19:46,101
Well, the son of a bitch was
already dead to me, right?

282
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:51,481
What, uh—

283
00:19:53,192 --> 00:19:55,944
What happened to him?

284
00:19:58,573 --> 00:20:02,409
Mayan war.
Wrong place, wrong time.

285
00:20:03,536 --> 00:20:08,290
The, uh, other bodies
they found in the hole—

286
00:20:08,374 --> 00:20:11,751
those are the two Mexicans
that killed your dad.

287
00:20:13,963 --> 00:20:15,964
Vengeance was meted out.

288
00:20:18,843 --> 00:20:20,844
The cops—

289
00:20:20,928 --> 00:20:25,015
they're gonna try to lay
all those bodies at Sam Crow's feet.

290
00:20:25,141 --> 00:20:28,310
That's bullshit.
I know. It ain't
a matter oftrue or false.

291
00:20:28,394 --> 00:20:31,980
Hale is gonna try
to screw with your compass.

292
00:20:33,441 --> 00:20:36,735
I don't want you losing true north.

293
00:21:12,855 --> 00:21:15,815
Inside the club there had to be truth.

294
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:18,068
Our word was our honor.

295
00:21:18,152 --> 00:21:20,278
But outside,
it was all about deception.

296
00:21:20,363 --> 00:21:23,281
Lies were our defense,
our default.

297
00:21:23,366 --> 00:21:26,284
To survive, you had to master
the art of perjury.

298
00:21:26,369 --> 00:21:29,287
The lie and the truth
had to feel the same.

299
00:21:29,372 --> 00:21:32,999
But once you learned that skill,
nobody knows the truth...

300
00:21:33,084 --> 00:21:36,002
in or outside the club.

301
00:21:36,087 --> 00:21:38,088
Especially you.

302
00:21:53,479 --> 00:21:55,480
Oh, my God.

303
00:22:16,293 --> 00:22:18,336
Holy shit.

304
00:22:21,132 --> 00:22:24,467
Two bodies were Mayan captains.
It had to be SAMCRO.

305
00:22:24,552 --> 00:22:27,303
Well, 1 5-year-old
Mexican bones give us nothing.

306
00:22:27,388 --> 00:22:31,808
Even with D.N.A., there's no
murder weapon. So it's ancient history.

307
00:22:31,934 --> 00:22:35,103
The U.S. Attorney's Office
won't touch it.
Look at this.

308
00:22:36,731 --> 00:22:38,815
Dead mechanic worked
for Teller-Morrow.

309
00:22:38,899 --> 00:22:42,235
History of drug abuse,
domestic violence.
His kid's on the way in.

310
00:22:42,319 --> 00:22:44,446
Following his old man's footsteps.

311
00:22:44,572 --> 00:22:46,865
Close to SAMCRO.
How close?

312
00:22:46,949 --> 00:22:48,950
I'm not sure.

313
00:22:50,119 --> 00:22:53,913
- Any word on Kohn?
- Checked out of his hotel.

314
00:22:53,998 --> 00:22:56,624
He turned in his rental car.
He may already be gone. Here we go.

315
00:22:57,752 --> 00:23:01,463
You, uh—
You wanted to see me?
Yeah.

316
00:23:01,547 --> 00:23:03,339
Have a seat, Lowell.

317
00:23:03,424 --> 00:23:07,093
I'm June Stahl, federal agent.

318
00:23:07,178 --> 00:23:10,972
I'm here helping out
the deputy chief.

319
00:23:11,057 --> 00:23:13,099
Oh, yeah?
You helping out with what?

320
00:23:13,184 --> 00:23:16,728
We have, uh, some sad news
for you about your father.

321
00:23:16,812 --> 00:23:20,815
Yeah, I know.
They found him in that hole off of 44.

322
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:23,902
Well, you don't seem
too surprised by that, Lowell.

323
00:23:23,986 --> 00:23:26,529
Well, you live
by the sword, you know?

324
00:23:26,614 --> 00:23:28,531
He was a mechanic,
not a gangster.

325
00:23:28,657 --> 00:23:31,201
Why was he buried
with outlaw bikers?
I don't know.

326
00:23:31,285 --> 00:23:34,454
- Your old man worked
for Teller-Morrow, right?
- Yeah.

327
00:23:34,580 --> 00:23:39,042
So the Sons ofAnarchy
must've trusted him.
He was a friend.

328
00:23:39,168 --> 00:23:41,419
Did Clay tell you that?
It's true.

329
00:23:41,545 --> 00:23:44,005
He was a friend,
and I'm a friend.
Right.

330
00:23:44,090 --> 00:23:46,091
Just like your dad.

331
00:23:46,175 --> 00:23:48,927
You're just a chip
offthe old spoon.

332
00:23:49,011 --> 00:23:52,889
Let's just hope we don't find you in
a ditch on a county road somewhere, huh?

333
00:23:54,517 --> 00:23:57,185
Who do you think killed him?

334
00:23:57,269 --> 00:24:00,605
You know, they found
three bullet holes in his head.

335
00:24:00,689 --> 00:24:03,942
Now, what could
a mechanic do that would
incite such a gruesome death?

336
00:24:04,068 --> 00:24:08,488
I don't know.
He was buried
with the enemy, Lowell.

337
00:24:08,572 --> 00:24:10,824
He was not a friend.

338
00:24:10,950 --> 00:24:13,076
He did something to piss off Clay.
No.

339
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:16,287
He was in the same grave
because he had the same killers.

340
00:24:16,372 --> 00:24:18,331
Use your head, Lowell.

341
00:24:18,415 --> 00:24:20,917
SAMCRO killed your father.

342
00:24:21,001 --> 00:24:23,628
- That is not true.
- Yes, it is.

343
00:24:23,712 --> 00:24:27,757
What's going on in here?
Who the hell are you?

344
00:24:27,883 --> 00:24:29,884
A.T .F .
Just what we need.

345
00:24:29,969 --> 00:24:32,512
You guys wanna rent
a goddamn wing?

346
00:24:32,596 --> 00:24:34,681
Aren't you spunky.

347
00:24:34,765 --> 00:24:38,476
- You done with him?
- For now.

348
00:24:38,561 --> 00:24:42,230
Get out of here, Lowell.
Go ahead. Go on.

349
00:24:47,611 --> 00:24:49,612
Pleasure.

350
00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:56,035
Bad enough I got to see the other one
every time I get a hot shave.

351
00:24:56,120 --> 00:25:00,248
Now I got to deal with Mrs. A.T.F.
chewing on my last nerve?

352
00:25:00,374 --> 00:25:03,001
When did you last see Kohn?
I just left him.

353
00:25:03,085 --> 00:25:04,919
At Floyd's.

354
00:25:10,426 --> 00:25:13,469
Who did this?
A.T .F .

355
00:25:13,596 --> 00:25:15,555
Why?
Tara.

356
00:25:15,639 --> 00:25:19,559
- That stupid bitch.
- How is this her fault?

357
00:25:22,730 --> 00:25:26,399
- This guy's dead.
- At least.

358
00:25:33,449 --> 00:25:35,658
Yeah. Kohn's still in town.

359
00:25:35,743 --> 00:25:39,162
I know. He's at Floyd's.
I'm taking care of it.

360
00:25:45,127 --> 00:25:47,128
Yep.

361
00:25:55,012 --> 00:25:58,139
You wanna go to war with me,
you sick piece of shit?

362
00:26:14,156 --> 00:26:15,990
This is bullshit.

363
00:26:16,075 --> 00:26:19,869
- He attacked me.
- No one backs your version, Kohn.

364
00:26:19,954 --> 00:26:23,122
- He put me through a goddamn window.
- Right.

365
00:26:23,207 --> 00:26:26,209
Apparently after you stabbed him
with some scissors.

366
00:26:26,293 --> 00:26:29,671
- No.
- Don't thinkJax is pressing charges.

367
00:26:29,755 --> 00:26:32,799
Oh. Shit. Great.
Thank you.

368
00:26:32,883 --> 00:26:35,343
But you will be facing charges
in Illinois...

369
00:26:35,427 --> 00:26:37,804
for violating a restraining order.

370
00:26:40,015 --> 00:26:43,518
I'm not stalking Tara.
I'm protecting her.

371
00:26:45,312 --> 00:26:49,023
Come on. We all know what happens
if she hooks up with Teller.

372
00:26:49,108 --> 00:26:52,068
You know I'm right.
We're all on the same team here.

373
00:26:52,152 --> 00:26:55,321
No, Josh.
Not anymore.

374
00:26:55,406 --> 00:26:57,949
You're in breach of about
a half a dozen federal statutes.

375
00:26:58,033 --> 00:27:02,328
You've been stripped
ofyour creds, and O.P.R.'s
gonna meet you at O'Hare.

376
00:27:02,413 --> 00:27:04,706
I hope that the stalk
was a good rush,

377
00:27:04,790 --> 00:27:07,041
'cause, uh, itjust
killed your career.

378
00:27:08,669 --> 00:27:10,670
Wait.

379
00:27:15,926 --> 00:27:18,845
She came back here because
she was afraid of me.

380
00:27:18,929 --> 00:27:22,181
I pointed her at SAMCRO.

381
00:27:22,266 --> 00:27:26,102
I can't fix that mistake,
but you can. Both ofyou can.

382
00:27:28,814 --> 00:27:30,565
Please.

383
00:27:40,659 --> 00:27:43,328
Barber says you
came in for a haircut.

384
00:27:43,412 --> 00:27:47,290
Agent Kohn attacked you
with a pair of scissors.

385
00:27:47,374 --> 00:27:52,253
So you pushed him through
a plate glass window. Self-defense.

386
00:27:52,338 --> 00:27:55,590
That's what Floyd saw,
I guess that's what happened.

387
00:27:58,677 --> 00:28:00,678
That's fantastic.

388
00:28:05,851 --> 00:28:08,061
Tell me.

389
00:28:08,145 --> 00:28:10,521
Are they all
just afraid ofyou...

390
00:28:10,606 --> 00:28:13,274
or convinced that you
are a necessary evil?

391
00:28:13,359 --> 00:28:15,610
You charging me?

392
00:28:15,694 --> 00:28:17,737
No charges.

393
00:28:17,821 --> 00:28:21,115
Why does Kohn have
a hard-on for you?

394
00:28:23,077 --> 00:28:26,037
You know why.

395
00:28:26,121 --> 00:28:28,706
You're right. I do.

396
00:28:30,626 --> 00:28:32,627
Tara Knowles.

397
00:28:32,711 --> 00:28:34,712
The charming ingenue.

398
00:28:34,838 --> 00:28:37,215
High school sweethearts,
right?
Yeah.

399
00:28:37,299 --> 00:28:40,218
She fears for her life,

400
00:28:40,302 --> 00:28:42,261
so she comes back home...

401
00:28:42,346 --> 00:28:46,599
to the only man she knows
loves her enough to protect her,

402
00:28:46,683 --> 00:28:49,060
a guy who would have
no problem...

403
00:28:49,144 --> 00:28:52,897
putting a fed through
a plate glass window.

404
00:28:52,981 --> 00:28:55,316
That's beautiful.

405
00:28:55,401 --> 00:28:57,402
Really, it is.

406
00:28:58,737 --> 00:29:01,739
I wish I had that kind
of pull over someone.

407
00:29:03,325 --> 00:29:05,326
You're a lucky man.

408
00:29:06,328 --> 00:29:08,079
You done?

409
00:29:08,163 --> 00:29:09,956
Yeah.

410
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:12,208
She's done.

411
00:29:47,828 --> 00:29:50,830
First fight of the afternoon. Round one.

412
00:29:50,914 --> 00:29:53,332
Let's go!

413
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:02,842
Come on! Hit him!

414
00:30:25,908 --> 00:30:27,408
Whoo!

415
00:30:49,014 --> 00:30:51,807
She's getting under his skin.

416
00:30:51,892 --> 00:30:54,936
I can feel it.
It's bad for us.

417
00:30:55,020 --> 00:30:57,063
I'm keeping an eye on it.

418
00:30:57,147 --> 00:31:00,900
I'm not gonna let anything turn Jax
away from Sam Crow, especially pussy.

419
00:31:00,984 --> 00:31:03,694
Tara's not pussy.
He loved her.

420
00:31:03,779 --> 00:31:05,905
Probably still does.

421
00:31:07,783 --> 00:31:09,784
Whoa.

422
00:31:09,868 --> 00:31:13,621
Hey. Anita just called.
Lowell? M.I.A.

423
00:31:13,705 --> 00:31:16,999
She just found Moby in the apartment,
crying and locked in the bathroom.

424
00:31:17,125 --> 00:31:20,795
Shit.
Yeah. He probably went
to Lodi looking to score.

425
00:31:27,511 --> 00:31:29,554
It's not your fault, baby.

426
00:31:29,638 --> 00:31:33,891
You've been taking care
of Lowell since he was 1 6.
You done everything you could.

427
00:31:33,976 --> 00:31:36,352
Just some shit you can't escape.

428
00:31:36,436 --> 00:31:38,813
It's like father, like son.

429
00:31:38,939 --> 00:31:41,649
Yeah.
Looks like
it's going that way.

430
00:31:42,734 --> 00:31:45,570
Got to remember what's important.

431
00:31:45,654 --> 00:31:50,283
- Big picture.
- I'll call the Vista, see if he checked in.

432
00:31:54,997 --> 00:31:57,999
No one blames you
if Lowell don't come home.

433
00:32:06,341 --> 00:32:08,509
Come on, Lowell.
Open up. I'm taking you home.

434
00:32:08,594 --> 00:32:10,761
It makes no sense.

435
00:32:10,846 --> 00:32:13,639
It's no sense that my dad
was buried with them wetbacks!

436
00:32:13,724 --> 00:32:18,436
How long you been taking care of me,
Clay? Huh? Why are you here now?

437
00:32:18,562 --> 00:32:22,148
I made a promise to your dad.
What, before you killed him?

438
00:32:22,232 --> 00:32:26,068
You kill him, Clay?
Why would you do that?

439
00:32:37,289 --> 00:32:39,415
I lied to you, son.

440
00:32:39,499 --> 00:32:43,669
Don't you call me that.
I am not that.

441
00:32:43,754 --> 00:32:46,505
Your father wasn't killed
by the enemy.

442
00:32:49,217 --> 00:32:51,218
He was the enemy.
No.

443
00:32:51,303 --> 00:32:53,387
He was a friend.

444
00:32:53,472 --> 00:32:55,473
He was a loathsome piece of shit.

445
00:32:55,557 --> 00:32:57,808
Treated you and
your mother like dirt.

446
00:32:57,893 --> 00:33:00,478
Cared more about the junk
than he did about his friends,

447
00:33:00,562 --> 00:33:02,521
his family.

448
00:33:04,232 --> 00:33:06,150
Sound familiar?

449
00:33:06,276 --> 00:33:08,694
I'm not that.
No?

450
00:33:08,779 --> 00:33:11,280
Then what the hell are you?

451
00:33:11,365 --> 00:33:13,407
You can't stay clean.

452
00:33:16,244 --> 00:33:18,204
You abandon your kid.

453
00:33:18,330 --> 00:33:21,540
Moby.
I killed your old man.

454
00:33:21,625 --> 00:33:24,627
I killed him 'cause he was a rat.

455
00:33:24,711 --> 00:33:26,962
A weakjunkie rat.

456
00:33:27,089 --> 00:33:30,383
I'm not a rat.
Look at you.

457
00:33:30,467 --> 00:33:35,137
Ten minutes with Hale,
you turn inside out. You run away.

458
00:33:35,222 --> 00:33:37,932
You don't give a shit
about your kid!

459
00:33:38,016 --> 00:33:42,228
- I'm sorry, Clay.
- Next time maybe Moby
drowns in that bathtub.

460
00:33:42,312 --> 00:33:44,730
Or maybe you tell
Hale and the feds...

461
00:33:44,815 --> 00:33:47,817
all those secrets you been hearing
at Teller-Morrow.

462
00:33:47,901 --> 00:33:52,446
I can't deal
with it anymore, Clay.

463
00:33:54,449 --> 00:33:56,450
My point.

464
00:33:58,578 --> 00:34:00,830
Oh, shit.
Oh, shit.

465
00:34:03,250 --> 00:34:05,543
I'm my old man.

466
00:34:08,630 --> 00:34:10,673
I'm Lowell.

467
00:34:10,757 --> 00:34:13,467
Oh, God.

468
00:34:15,637 --> 00:34:17,638
I'm sorry, Clay.

469
00:34:19,808 --> 00:34:23,394
I know that you tried to help me.
You help Moby.

470
00:34:23,478 --> 00:34:25,604
You save him from me.

471
00:34:26,815 --> 00:34:28,774
Do it, please.

472
00:34:28,859 --> 00:34:31,402
You help my little boy.

473
00:34:41,705 --> 00:34:43,873
This is it, prospect,
your final fight.

474
00:34:43,999 --> 00:34:46,125
How you feeling?
I'm good, man.

475
00:34:46,209 --> 00:34:48,169
This asshole
looks half dead.

476
00:34:48,253 --> 00:34:51,422
Well, he's had a tougher climb.
It's a beautiful thing.

477
00:34:51,506 --> 00:34:53,924
It is a beautiful thing.
You're looking like a champ.

478
00:34:54,009 --> 00:34:57,303
Everybody's betting on you,
except for us.

479
00:34:57,387 --> 00:34:59,180
What do you mean?

480
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:03,559
You want me to lose?

481
00:35:03,643 --> 00:35:07,062
Shit. No, come on, man.
I can beat this guy.
I can win this whole thing.

482
00:35:07,147 --> 00:35:09,106
Ifyou win this, we get 1 5 grand.

483
00:35:09,191 --> 00:35:12,109
You lose, we walk home with 1 0 times
that much. So you lose.

484
00:35:12,194 --> 00:35:14,153
You're gonna take a dive,
Kippy, for the club.

485
00:35:14,237 --> 00:35:15,863
Go get him.
Sort of.

486
00:35:23,330 --> 00:35:26,624
Come on, son!

487
00:35:26,708 --> 00:35:29,293
Come on!
Get 'em in there!

488
00:35:32,047 --> 00:35:34,089
Why aren't you at the fight?

489
00:35:34,174 --> 00:35:37,051
I've had my share for the day.

490
00:35:37,177 --> 00:35:40,262
Yeah.

491
00:35:40,347 --> 00:35:42,723
Your leg okay?

492
00:35:42,808 --> 00:35:44,809
Yeah.

493
00:35:51,191 --> 00:35:54,235
Where's the doctor?
I don't know.

494
00:35:54,319 --> 00:35:57,738
Where you going
with that, Jax?

495
00:35:57,823 --> 00:35:59,824
Nowhere.

496
00:35:59,908 --> 00:36:02,535
I don't believe that.
I've seen the two ofyou together.

497
00:36:02,619 --> 00:36:05,621
See how you act
around her.

498
00:36:05,747 --> 00:36:07,832
She's still got ties in you.
You know what?

499
00:36:07,916 --> 00:36:09,458
I don't give a shit what you think.

500
00:36:09,543 --> 00:36:13,295
What I do, what Tara does—
it's not your business.

501
00:36:13,380 --> 00:36:15,923
Cleaning up piss
and broken cribs,
that's my business?

502
00:36:16,007 --> 00:36:18,509
No one asked you
to take this on.

503
00:36:18,593 --> 00:36:22,805
This house, this kid.
It's not your burden. It's mine.

504
00:36:31,773 --> 00:36:33,774
Shit.

505
00:36:53,253 --> 00:36:55,671
You deal with that Lowell problem?

506
00:36:55,755 --> 00:36:59,633
Call Anita. Tell her she's gonna be
watching Moby for a while.

507
00:36:59,718 --> 00:37:02,303
All right.

508
00:37:05,932 --> 00:37:08,976
Give it one more round,
and then he falls.

509
00:37:18,028 --> 00:37:20,404
I understand you, uh,

510
00:37:20,488 --> 00:37:23,574
declined Bobby's request
for some comfort.

511
00:37:23,658 --> 00:37:25,576
Yeah. I did.

512
00:37:25,660 --> 00:37:27,828
I'm not about that anymore.

513
00:37:30,999 --> 00:37:34,168
If I was to ask for some comfort,

514
00:37:34,252 --> 00:37:36,295
would you be about that?

515
00:37:39,633 --> 00:37:41,592
No. I'm sorry.

516
00:37:41,676 --> 00:37:45,846
But your old lady would
turn us both into chum.

517
00:37:45,931 --> 00:37:48,849
Yeah, that's a good point.

518
00:37:51,728 --> 00:37:54,313
If, uh, Half-Sack patches in—

519
00:37:54,397 --> 00:37:57,274
which is a big "if"—

520
00:37:57,359 --> 00:37:59,652
it's all right with me
ifyou stick around.

521
00:38:01,863 --> 00:38:05,491
That is, if he wants you
as his old lady.

522
00:38:05,575 --> 00:38:08,911
Thank you.

523
00:38:08,995 --> 00:38:10,537
Oh, shit. Shit!

524
00:38:12,082 --> 00:38:13,707
Half-Sack, don't!

525
00:38:15,085 --> 00:38:16,710
What's he doing?

526
00:38:19,965 --> 00:38:22,841
What's he doing?
What the hell's he doing?
Gonna K.O. this guy.

527
00:38:24,511 --> 00:38:28,263
- Shit, I'll kill him. I'll kill him.
- No, no, no. My bad. My bad.

528
00:38:28,348 --> 00:38:31,100
Get him out ofthere before
we got to bury another Mexican.

529
00:38:31,184 --> 00:38:34,144
Come on!

530
00:38:34,229 --> 00:38:38,565
Hey, hey, hey!
Chill! Relax, you muppet.

531
00:38:38,650 --> 00:38:41,276
Whoo!

532
00:38:46,992 --> 00:38:50,494
Clay, I'm really sorry.
You know, I just lost it. I don't—

533
00:38:50,578 --> 00:38:52,997
You owe the club 35K.

534
00:38:53,123 --> 00:38:55,207
Really?
Hey.

535
00:38:55,291 --> 00:38:57,167
At least you got the girl, huh?

536
00:38:57,252 --> 00:39:00,754
Come on. Get out of here
before I rape both ofyou.

537
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:05,050
Tig. Hey.
It's just an expression.
Term of endearment.

538
00:39:07,137 --> 00:39:10,305
We're gonna need
the hundred and 1 5 by Friday.

539
00:39:10,432 --> 00:39:13,434
Gonna be a busy week.
You said it.

540
00:39:20,692 --> 00:39:23,819
He's a good mechanic.

541
00:39:34,372 --> 00:39:37,499
Jesus. Are you okay?
Yeah.

542
00:39:39,294 --> 00:39:41,295
Hale told me what happened.

543
00:39:43,882 --> 00:39:46,925
Kohn's gone.
I watched him leave town.

544
00:39:52,474 --> 00:39:54,475
Thank you.

545
00:39:59,731 --> 00:40:01,940
What is it?

546
00:40:04,652 --> 00:40:08,113
You left Chicago 'cause you were afraid
this guy was gonna hurt you.

547
00:40:10,116 --> 00:40:12,284
One ofthe reasons.

548
00:40:12,368 --> 00:40:16,038
Did you come back here
'cause you knew I'd hurt this guy,

549
00:40:16,164 --> 00:40:18,999
do what the cops wouldn't do?
God, no.

550
00:40:20,335 --> 00:40:22,419
I had no idea
he would follow me.

551
00:40:22,504 --> 00:40:25,672
I— I didn't know
you'd even still be here.

552
00:40:31,179 --> 00:40:33,847
That doesn't sound
like you, Jax.

553
00:40:35,100 --> 00:40:37,101
It sounds like your mother.

554
00:40:40,355 --> 00:40:42,356
Well, you're safe now.

555
00:40:56,246 --> 00:40:58,288
How'd it go, baby?

556
00:41:05,213 --> 00:41:07,256
Where is he?

557
00:41:08,883 --> 00:41:10,884
Sam Crow rehab.

558
00:41:14,556 --> 00:41:17,307
What'd you tell Jax?

559
00:41:17,392 --> 00:41:19,852
About the bodies.

560
00:41:22,188 --> 00:41:24,189
Some ofthe truth.

561
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:27,401
And Lowell?

562
00:41:29,779 --> 00:41:31,780
A little more.

563
00:41:35,118 --> 00:41:37,911
The rest stays buried.

564
00:41:41,082 --> 00:41:43,208
Yeah.

565
00:41:43,293 --> 00:41:46,378
And rest in peace.
