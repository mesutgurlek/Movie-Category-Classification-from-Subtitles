showing my son, Josh,
how to carve a roasted chicken.

00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:39,800
Yeah?
He said, "The tenderest
part of the chicken...

53
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:43,700
is the oysters
here on either side
of the back."

that expression
before..."oysters."

I'd love to meet him.

380
00:34:43,900 --> 00:34:46,300
Have you considered
the possibility
that he is disfigured...

381
00:34:46,300 --> 00:34:48,400
or that he may believe
he is disfigured?

382
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:50,400
The mirrors.

383
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:52,600
Yes. You notice he smashes
all the mirrors
in the houses...

384
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:54,900
and not just enough
to get the pieces he wants.

385
00:34:54,900 --> 00:34:58,600
Of course, those shards
in their eyes... so he can
see himself there.

386
00:34:58,600 --> 00:35:01,900
That's interesting.
No, it's not interesting.
You thought of that before.

387
00:35:01,900 --> 00:35:05,700
I had considered it.
What about the women?
Uh-huh.

388
00:35:05,700 --> 00:35:09,600
Dead... mere puppets.
You need to see them living,

389
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:12,400
the way they caught his eye.

390
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:15,500
- That's impossible.
- Almost, not quite.

391
00:35:17,100 --> 00:35:20,100
What were the yards like?

392
00:35:20,100 --> 00:35:25,100
Big back yards.
Fenced, some hedges.
Why?

393
00:35:25,100 --> 00:35:28,200
Because if this pilgrim
feels a special relationship
with the moon,

394
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:31,200
he might like to go outside
and look at it.

395
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:35,400
You ever seen blood
in the moonlight, Will?
It appears quite black.

396
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:41,100
If one were nude, say, it would
be better to have outdoor
privacy for that sort of thing.

397
00:35:41,100 --> 00:35:44,300
You think the yards
might be a factor
when he selects victims?

398
00:35:44,300 --> 00:35:48,300
Oh, yes, and there will be
more of them of course...

This stuff

to handle.

588

I don't need
to tell you that.

Oh, Mister D.

Whoa. I'm not interrupting
anything here, am I?

No, Ralph.

592
00:52:28,100 --> 00:52:30,600
Listen, Reba, it's starting
to spritz outside. How about
I give you a lift home?

593
00:52:30,600 --> 00:52:33,700
You ride a motorcycle, Ralph.
How's that gonna help me
with the rain?

594
00:52:33,700 --> 00:52:37,400
Well, I thought maybe...
stop off someplace,

595
00:52:37,400 --> 00:52:39,500

a little sundowner.

In fact,

613
00:54:40,700 --> 00:54:45,500
one of my earliest memories
is seeing a cougar

to hang on to what
that cougar looked like. </i>

Although by now,
to tell you the truth,
what I see in my head...

618
00:55:17,400 --> 00:55:19,600
is probably not the least bit
like a cougar.

619
00:55:19,600 --> 00:55:21,800
It's more like a donkey
or a goat.

620

<i>You know, sometimes I'm not
so sure I really saw him. </i>

621

I dreamed up.

622

You okay?
Uh-huh.

623
00:55:34,900 --> 00:55:39,500

you will because...

632

I know what it's like
to have people always thinking
that you're different.

633
00:56:22,200 --> 00:56:26,500
Mm-hmm. Well...
that's good.

Take my word
that I'm smiling.

other than one or two little
keepsakes Niles Jacobi got.

644
00:57:24,400 --> 00:57:27,700
That would be Mr. Jacobi's

645
00:57:27,700 --> 00:57:31,000
Yeah, that's right.
As their executor, I keep all
that stuff here in the office,

Sounds like a fan letter
mailed by the Tooth Fairy.

He's curious about you.

Tell them to pull the circuit
