00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:34,284
After the holidays, back to school

7
00:04:34,002 --> 00:04:35,253
He's dead!

8
00:05:07,185 --> 00:05:11,211
No larking about this year!

9
00:05:11,425 --> 00:05:12,350
Think so?

10
00:05:20,795 --> 00:05:22,016
Hey, Kid Beans!

11
00:05:22,491 --> 00:05:23,613
We had a dead guy with us

12
00:05:23,741 --> 00:05:25,593
Behave yourself Caussat!

13
00:05:34,623 --> 00:05:40,098
I shall bring Rene Tabard 
in the morning: he's homesick

14
00:05:44,009 --> 00:05:47,009
He was dead

15
00:05:47,110 --> 00:05:49,010
No kidding, see for yourself

16
00:06:04,011 --> 00:06:05,893
I'm the new master

17
00:06:09,975 --> 00:06:11,420
Huguet

18
00:06:45,013 --> 00:06:50,713
Rene Tabard: absent, staying with
his parents until tomorrow

19
00:06:53,014 --> 00:06:54,820
Good night, housemaster

20
00:07:44,315 --> 00:07:46,015
To the foot of my bed, Dupont!

21
00:08:22,616 --> 00:08:26,016
Who's there?
Caussat...Bruel...Colin

22
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:28,017
Where's Dupont?

23
00:08:29,350 --> 00:08:35,018
I didn't call you three but now
you can stay here until eleven

24
00:08:48,701 --> 00:08:50,106
I've got to go sir!

25
00:08:50,350 --> 00:08:52,020
Can he go sir?

26
00:08:59,021 --> 00:09:03,818
Sir, he's got to go!

27
00:09:08,022 --> 00:09:10,462
Go on, don't worry about that fool

28
00:09:16,829 --> 00:09:20,010
Are you there, Caussat, Bruel
and Colin?

29
00:09:20,324 --> 00:09:22,024
Go back to bed

30
00:10:06,025 --> 00:10:09,424
Keep quiet, or he'll drop dead

31
00:10:35,491 --> 00:10:42,462
Up! Up! Quickly now!

32
00:11:36,367 --> 00:11:40,092
Bruel, Caussat, Colin...
zero forconduct, detention on Sunday

33
00:12:03,388 --> 00:12:04,688
Late as usual Bruel

34
00:12:11,707 --> 00:12:13,025
Hurry along there!

35
00:12:18,045 --> 00:12:20,038
Do you want a black mark for conduct?

36
00:12:34,730 --> 00:12:38,130
BOYS IN CONSPIRACY

37
00:12:39,150 --> 00:12:42,462
Here's the plan: 
the conspiracy is ready

38
00:12:43,062 --> 00:12:48,457
We're in detention, 
so we hide in the attic

39
00:12:49,535 --> 00:12:51,448
Caussat knows where to get food

40
00:12:55,033 --> 00:12:56,575
What's Tabard looking at?

41
00:12:58,594 --> 00:13:01,417
Watch out, teacher!
Oh Huguet's a good guy

42
00:13:33,793 --> 00:13:36,266
So, on the Day, we hoist the flag

43
00:14:35,614 --> 00:14:36,663
What about ammunition?

44
00:15:15,092 --> 00:15:18,273
To your places! Get a move on!

45
00:15:58,737 --> 00:16:00,740
Someone's pinched my chocolate

46
00:16:01,098 --> 00:16:01,828
He's been snooping again

47
00:16:08,647 --> 00:16:10,936
Been snooping again has he?
Give me your glue-pots

48
00:16:48,250 --> 00:16:49,536
Watch this

49
00:17:02,427 --> 00:17:03,892
Give me some paper from the drawer

50
00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:11,783
The ink...and a pen

51
00:17:16,772 --> 00:17:18,543
Isn't she a beauty?

52
00:18:09,222 --> 00:18:10,096
Give me that

53
00:18:32,508 --> 00:18:33,255
To your places

54
00:18:43,895 --> 00:18:47,568
Caussat and Colin, bring me 
your algebra books

55
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:51,617
No, don't bother; 
you're in detention on Sunday

56
00:19:24,050 --> 00:19:25,095
The Headmaster is here

57
00:19:26,595 --> 00:19:27,825
Please come to my study, Housemaster

58
00:21:17,135 --> 00:21:21,695
Our Commemoration Day is nigh
isn't that so?

59
00:21:21,696 --> 00:21:24,500
I want no trouble, 
no larking about

60
00:21:24,859 --> 00:21:27,898
I mean Bruel, Caussat and Colin...
isn't that so?

61
00:21:47,238 --> 00:21:53,773
As for Huguet, what you tell me
is most agitating

62
00:23:10,041 --> 00:23:12,989
And finally, Housemaster, you tell me...

63
00:23:13,634 --> 00:23:16,218
...Tabard and Bruel 
are behaving unnaturally

64
00:23:17,095 --> 00:23:22,773
Do you realize the immensity of
our moral responsibility?

65
00:23:44,571 --> 00:23:48,576
Huguet is back alone?
What about the boys?

66
00:23:55,733 --> 00:23:57,226
It's intolerable

67
00:24:01,419 --> 00:24:02,869
Together again

68
00:24:03,411 --> 00:24:11,654
It's unwholesome, Housemaster
They must be watched

69
00:24:12,961 --> 00:24:16,455
Sit down

70
00:24:20,187 --> 00:24:22,976
I might almost be your father, child

71
00:24:23,616 --> 00:24:27,408
At your age, there are things...
isn't that so?

72
00:24:28,218 --> 00:24:29,942
Bruel, I mean, is older than you...

73
00:24:31,445 --> 00:24:35,343
Your sensibility, and then his...
isn't that so?

74
00:24:37,136 --> 00:24:38,644
Neuropaths...psychopaths...

75
00:24:38,877 --> 00:24:40,420
...and who knows what else?

76
00:24:52,908 --> 00:24:54,546
Come and sit beside me

77
00:24:59,065 --> 00:25:01,211
Colin and Caussat to the visitors' room

78
00:25:10,485 --> 00:25:12,025
Do you want to be kept in?

79
00:25:32,748 --> 00:25:37,064
I have to spend Sundays 
in the kitchen with mother

80
00:25:37,332 --> 00:25:38,741
You can visit your tarts

81
00:25:41,963 --> 00:25:45,417
SUNDAY, CAUSSAT AT HIS GUARDIAN'S

82
00:26:20,340 --> 00:26:23,703
COLIN WITH MA BEANS, HIS MOTHER

83
00:26:43,619 --> 00:26:45,178
Come and look, Tabard

84
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:04,778
Give Tabard the chocolate

85
00:27:10,617 --> 00:27:11,481
He's no traitor

86
00:27:12,213 --> 00:27:16,747
Caussat should have let him 
into the plot...

87
00:27:17,865 --> 00:27:19,688
...because I say so

88
00:27:22,703 --> 00:27:24,568
In any case, he's got a hiding place

89
00:27:25,660 --> 00:27:32,187
He'll help us. He doesn't like teachers
any more than we do

90
00:27:50,295 --> 00:27:56,026
Yes, Housemaster, beans again
Always beans!

91
00:27:57,387 --> 00:28:00,298
I can't give the boys beans every day

92
00:28:09,847 --> 00:28:11,178
Beans again!

93
00:29:06,817 --> 00:29:19,899
Down with Ma Beans! 
We hate beans!

94
00:29:43,259 --> 00:29:46,760
Tabard's got a hiding place
He has? Where?

95
00:29:48,176 --> 00:29:50,856
Well, if you don't know, shut up!

96
00:29:51,452 --> 00:29:56,534
Bruel wants him to join
Tabard's a sissy

97
00:29:56,782 --> 00:29:59,056
No, the Head had him up
for something

98
00:29:59,656 --> 00:30:03,696
He's a sissy, anyway. 
What good is he?

99
00:30:38,073 --> 00:30:40,750
How very witty

100
00:30:41,749 --> 00:30:46,581
But I don't care for all that at all,
not at all

101
00:31:55,340 --> 00:31:59,376
Well, my lad, aren't we taking notes 
this morning?

102
00:32:03,794 --> 00:32:06,813
That's better

103
00:32:09,567 --> 00:32:11,698
I was only saying...

104
00:32:11,990 --> 00:32:13,578
Bugger off...you shit

105
00:32:32,302 --> 00:32:33,128
Tabard

106
00:32:35,496 --> 00:32:39,094
My boy, the disciplinary committee 
has agreed

107
00:32:39,565 --> 00:32:44,060
...under pressure from your
soft-hearted teacher...

108
00:32:44,924 --> 00:32:46,695
Such magnanimity, Mr Viot

109
00:32:47,777 --> 00:32:53,218
...out of consideration for your
family and concern for you...

110
00:32:53,745 --> 00:32:56,783
...and in view of the celebration of
our Commemoration Day tomorrow...

111
00:32:57,423 --> 00:32:58,901
...to excuse your behaviour

112
00:33:00,055 --> 00:33:06,107
Especially as you have, so to speak
offered your apologies

113
00:33:06,333 --> 00:33:12,385
Apologies which are worthless unless
repeated before your peers

114
00:33:13,137 --> 00:33:13,866
We are waiting

115
00:33:15,265 --> 00:33:19,914
Come now, what do you want to say?

116
00:33:20,210 --> 00:33:21,754
Sir, I say the teacher is a shit!

117
00:33:37,337 --> 00:33:41,862
War is declared! Down with teachers!
Up with revolution!

118
00:33:42,103 --> 00:33:45,651
Liberty or Death!|Our flag must be raised!

119
00:33:45,924 --> 00:33:47,209
Stand firm tomorrow!

120
00:33:47,663 --> 00:33:51,255
We'll fight with rotten old books,
tincans and smelly boots!

121
00:33:51,536 --> 00:33:52,697
The ammo's in the attic!

122
00:33:52,736 --> 00:33:56,506
We'll bombard the old
Commemoration Day dummies!

123
00:36:35,052 --> 00:36:40,513
The next morning, 
fatigue is the quartet's accomplice

124
00:38:21,695 --> 00:38:26,502
The boys have barricaded themselves
in the attic. It's unprecedented

125
00:38:26,897 --> 00:38:28,304
Governor, what an honour

126
00:38:31,854 --> 00:38:33,488
The Governor is seated

127
00:38:35,508 --> 00:38:36,652
This is terrible
