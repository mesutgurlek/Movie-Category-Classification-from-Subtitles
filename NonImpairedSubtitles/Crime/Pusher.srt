- l've never fucked Vic.
- You haven't?

299
00:31:16,107 --> 00:31:17,335
l can't.

300
00:31:21,412 --> 00:31:24,006
l can't deal with paid-for pussy.

301
00:31:24,682 --> 00:31:30,518
The first time, when she was just
lyin' there. . .all doped-out. . .

302
00:31:31,256 --> 00:31:33,554
l had my hand between her legs. . .

303
00:31:37,929 --> 00:31:42,093
But she sucks my dick.
She sucks a real good dick.

304
00:31:44,569 --> 00:31:48,835
- Never stick your dick in a whore.
- l don't mind.

305
00:31:48,973 --> 00:31:53,103
- l once fucked up a client of hers.
- Why?

306
00:31:53,745 --> 00:31:59,206
l was driving around and saw her
coming out of a building.

307
00:32:00,251 --> 00:32:02,446
This guy followed her out.

308
00:32:03,388 --> 00:32:09,554
So l followed him
over to the pisser by the church. . .

309
00:32:10,662 --> 00:32:13,358
So, he's standing there, pissing.

310
00:32:14,999 --> 00:32:16,694
l went over to him and said. . .

311
00:32:19,470 --> 00:32:22,166
''Man, you got a little dick, huh?''

312
00:32:22,573 --> 00:32:25,599
He couldn't do anything
'cause he was pissing.

313
00:32:26,644 --> 00:32:27,668
What then?

314
00:32:28,279 --> 00:32:33,649
l said, ''That's the ugliest dick
l've ever seen.''

315
00:32:34,886 --> 00:32:36,649
Then l took him by the neck. . .

316
00:32:39,223 --> 00:32:40,554
He goes down. . .

317
00:32:42,493 --> 00:32:47,089
So l did a few
Fred Astaire moves on him.

318
00:32:47,699 --> 00:32:53,865
- You should've kicked him.
- There's no room in there to kick.

319
00:32:54,005 --> 00:32:57,634
Here, watch this. Stand still.
Take these. . .

320
00:32:58,810 --> 00:33:00,107
Circle kick. . .

321
00:33:01,312 --> 00:33:05,476
- Stand still, man. Come here.
- lf you hit me. . .

322
00:33:09,220 --> 00:33:10,312
Shit!

323
00:33:12,991 --> 00:33:15,585
- What did you do?
- What did l do?

324
00:33:17,195 --> 00:33:23,134
- We don't have time for this.
- l'm in pain! lt's not a joke!

325
00:33:25,169 --> 00:33:26,227
Open the door.

326
00:33:34,779 --> 00:33:36,440
What a pain in the ass!

327
00:33:36,881 --> 00:33:39,509
- Does it hurt?
- Yeah, it hurts. What do you think?

328
00:33:39,717 --> 00:33:45,349
- l can't see with your shoe on.
- l'll do it myself. Get away!

329
00:33:45,523 --> 00:33:49,721
l'll do it myself.
lt hurts like a motherfucker.

330
00:33:53,731 --> 00:33:56,131
l can't get this shit off.

331
00:34:02,106 --> 00:34:04,233
Shit, it hurts!

332
00:34:05,043 --> 00:34:08,706
- Not so hard. . .
- Try to sit still.

333
00:34:11,716 --> 00:34:12,410
They're here, Frank.

Okay, then give me the dope.

336
00:34:53,191 --> 00:34:54,180
What's up?

337
00:35:03,167 --> 00:35:06,694
- Why are we moving?
- lt's safer this way.

338
00:35:12,710 --> 00:35:16,874
- You got the stuff?
- You got the money?

339
00:35:18,783 --> 00:35:22,583
- How are you?
- What do you mean?

340
00:35:23,054 --> 00:35:27,252
- You seem a little nervous.

341
00:35:28,659 --> 00:35:32,026

- Frank, the stuff first.
- The money.

343
00:35:37,635 --> 00:35:39,728

00:37:11,796 --> 00:37:13,491
l'm out of shape.

352
00:37:42,460 --> 00:37:44,394
Sit down.

353
00:37:47,031 --> 00:37:54,335
Frank Jensen, 290967-2451 , charged
with selling an illegal substance.

354
00:37:54,472 --> 00:37:56,497
- Coffee?
- Yes, please.

355
00:37:57,942 --> 00:37:59,603
Have you warmed up a bit?

356
00:38:02,513 --> 00:38:05,141
What were you doing
in that rental car?

357
00:38:05,983 --> 00:38:07,951
Swedish rental car. . .

358
00:38:11,022 --> 00:38:14,981
- Who were the Swedes?
- You flew out of that car.

359
00:38:15,159 --> 00:38:18,356
You stampeded a cop,
with a brown cloud around you. . .

360
00:38:18,496 --> 00:38:22,364
and made us wade out in the water
to get you and a bag.

361
00:38:22,700 --> 00:38:26,659
Do you know how deep the shit is
under your feet?

362
00:38:27,338 --> 00:38:31,035
- What kind of dope was it?
- Man, you gotta talk slower.

363
00:38:31,175 --> 00:38:35,271
- Was it 200 grams?
- l don't know anything about it.

364
00:38:35,479 --> 00:38:40,542
ln 1 991 you got six months
for possession of cocaine. Correct?

365
00:38:41,752 --> 00:38:46,121
- l was in, l can't remember why.
- Can we agree you're in deep shit?

366
00:38:49,660 --> 00:38:54,393
You're in deep.
Someone must want their money.

367
00:38:54,632 --> 00:38:58,898
- You got anything to say?
- l'd like a private bath next time.

368
00:39:00,304 --> 00:39:04,832
- Should we let him think about it?
- lt's filthy in there.

369
00:39:04,975 --> 00:39:10,413
They pay you shit, so they must have
enough left for cleaning ladies.

370
00:39:11,582 --> 00:39:15,484
THURSDAY

371
00:39:18,155 --> 00:39:22,387
lt's cleaning time.
You can do the rest yourself.

372
00:39:37,808 --> 00:39:40,572
Where did it come from,
and who was buying it?

373
00:39:41,479 --> 00:39:47,042
Still nothing to say?
Come on, Frank, you're wasting time.

374
00:39:48,185 --> 00:39:52,349
You can't hold me more than
24 hours. Stick to the rules, boys.

375
00:39:53,557 --> 00:39:54,751
What time is it?

376
00:39:57,628 --> 00:40:02,588
- You only got a few minutes left.
- There's some people outside. . .

377
00:40:02,733 --> 00:40:07,568
- You don't know anything.
- No, that's why you're here.

378
00:40:07,705 --> 00:40:12,574
You don't know shit. . .
Christ, you guys know nothing.

379
00:40:12,943 --> 00:40:18,108
We don't know anything?
What was it Tonny said?

380
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:27,687
- You do a lot of business with him?
- Look what l have here.

381
00:40:28,225 --> 00:40:32,753
A signed deposition from Tonny,
your good buddy.

00:40:33,164 --> 00:40:38,431
- ls it a solid partnership?
- Signature. . . deposition. . .

383
00:40:41,038 --> 00:40:42,596

00:40:45,276 --> 00:40:48,404
Don't play the hero.
Come on, Frank.

385
00:41:02,426 --> 00:41:03,654
Come on, Frank.

386
00:41:06,764 --> 00:41:10,165
Say something.
lt's for your own good.

387
00:41:11,802 --> 00:41:15,431
We know there's a lot of people
waiting for you.

388
00:41:16,340 --> 00:41:20,367
- Nothing, huh?
- Take your clothes and piss off.

389
00:41:20,511 --> 00:41:24,311
The time is 2:00 p.m., it's Thursday
the 22nd, and you're released.

390
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:32,614
lf you want to talk,
you know where we are.

391
00:41:51,242 --> 00:41:56,407
Milo. . .
l'm sorry, Milo.

392
00:41:56,881 --> 00:42:00,476
Frankie. . .
What a surprise, Frankie.

393
00:42:00,851 --> 00:42:04,878
l'm sorry
l didn't show up yesterday.

394
00:42:05,055 --> 00:42:10,186
- We had a deal? l don't remember.
- l was gonna come with the money.

395
00:42:10,728 --> 00:42:14,926
Radovan, can you remember
if we had an appointment yesterday?

396
00:42:16,867 --> 00:42:19,700
Come here.
Sit down, Frank.

397
00:42:26,410 --> 00:42:27,570
What then?

398
00:42:28,779 --> 00:42:32,647
l don't have the dope,
and l don't have the money.

399
00:42:35,953 --> 00:42:39,787
Why don't you have the dope,
and why don't you have the money?

400
00:42:39,924 --> 00:42:44,122
- The police got me yesterday.
- You were busted?

401
00:42:45,296 --> 00:42:51,064
Frank was busted!
With 200 grams, yeah?

402
00:42:52,169 --> 00:42:56,833
And you're not in jail, or solitary,
or whatever it's called?

403
00:42:57,274 --> 00:43:00,710
That's strange. What do l say?
That's strange.

404
00:43:00,844 --> 00:43:05,338
lt's in the lake.
All the dope's in the lake.

405
00:43:07,051 --> 00:43:09,747
- The dope's in the lake?
- lt's in the lake.

406
00:43:11,355 --> 00:43:13,482
200 grams in the lake.

407
00:43:16,293 --> 00:43:19,558
My best friend in Copenhagen.
Frank. . .

408
00:43:20,798 --> 00:43:25,735
200 grams in the lake, yeah?
Tell me some more.

409
00:43:25,936 --> 00:43:29,372
- There isn't. . .
- Help me.

410
00:43:30,708 --> 00:43:33,006
We're you busted or not?

411
00:43:33,243 --> 00:43:35,108
Come on, l told you l was busted.

412
00:43:35,279 --> 00:43:41,946
- lf you were, show me your papers.
- l don't have papers. What papers?

413
00:43:42,987 --> 00:43:45,581
You don't get papers
if they don't find anything.

414
00:43:52,463 --> 00:43:55,193
lt's like a bad joke. . .

415
00:43:56,367 --> 00:43:58,927
Should l believe you, Frank?

416
00:44:02,373 --> 00:44:04,500
What do l do now?

417
00:44:12,216 --> 00:44:15,413
You owe me 1 80 now.

418
00:44:16,487 --> 00:44:19,285
lt's not 1 80, it's 1 20.

419
00:44:19,556 --> 00:44:21,717
How much did we say?

420
00:44:23,861 --> 00:44:28,264
The deal was 1 20,
and l owe you 50 from last week.

421
00:44:28,532 --> 00:44:31,592
No, no. . .
No, Frankie.

422
00:44:31,735 --> 00:44:35,136
lt was 1 20. lt was.

423
00:44:36,006 --> 00:44:39,965
But now it's 1 80.
1 80.

424
00:44:42,846 --> 00:44:47,180
You want to ask why?
Ask. . .

425
00:44:47,317 --> 00:44:52,619
- Why?
- lt's for the story you brought me.

426
00:44:53,791 --> 00:45:02,096
You see, it keeps getting bigger.
So, it's 1 80. . .50 now.

427
00:45:17,848 --> 00:45:19,247
Frank. . .

428
00:45:21,885 --> 00:45:26,822
What can you do?
Can you bring me some money now?

429
00:45:26,990 --> 00:45:30,892
lf Radovan comes with me now,
l can get you 50,000.

430
00:45:32,796 --> 00:45:36,254
- l just gotta take care of something.
- Can you do it?

431
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:40,962
There's a guy who owes me 50.
We can do it now.

432
00:45:42,673 --> 00:45:44,937
- And the rest?
- Next week.

433
00:45:46,410 --> 00:45:49,641
Okay. 50 now. . .

434
00:45:56,386 --> 00:45:58,286
Do you want coffee?

435
00:45:59,389 --> 00:46:03,723
- l'll be back in a little while.
- Take care.

436
00:46:13,003 --> 00:46:17,269
What's goin' on?
What are you doin'?

437
00:46:19,143 --> 00:46:21,543
What did you tell the cops?

438
00:46:37,227 --> 00:46:41,288
What are you doin'?
What the fuck are you doin'?

439
00:46:45,636 --> 00:46:48,230
What did you tell the cops?

440
00:46:51,608 --> 00:46:53,075
Fuck you!

441
00:46:59,983 --> 00:47:01,780
Take it easy, Frank.

442
00:47:03,287 --> 00:47:07,986
What did you say?
Did you say something?

443
00:48:21,865 --> 00:48:24,493
- ls he dangerous?
- No.

444
00:48:25,202 --> 00:48:29,502
He's just the kind
who buys and buys without paying.

445
00:48:32,609 --> 00:48:36,238
Either he's not home,
or says he'll pay tomorrow.

446
00:48:36,413 --> 00:48:42,181
You gotta be on 'em 24 hours a day,
always reminding them what they owe.

447
00:48:43,287 --> 00:48:50,250
There was this Turk who fucked up
and was into Milo for 30,000.

448
00:48:51,128 --> 00:48:55,929
So l had to go out there.
l'd been there a few times. . .

449
00:48:56,066 --> 00:48:58,466
and asked for the money nicely.

450
00:48:59,970 --> 00:49:02,905
ln the end l had to go out there
with a knife.

451
00:49:03,974 --> 00:49:08,911
l stuck it into his knees and tore
it up, so the kneecap came out.

452
00:49:12,549 --> 00:49:17,680
l'll tell you, Frank, l think a lot
about doing something else.

453
00:49:17,821 --> 00:49:21,780
- Just leaving this all behind.
- What would you do?

454
00:49:24,628 --> 00:49:27,995
Milo's a good cook, right?
Especially cakes.

455
00:49:29,466 --> 00:49:35,132
But l'm a good cook, too.
Shish kebab. That's my specialty.

456
00:49:35,272 --> 00:49:40,369
You gotta try it sometime.
l get special spices for it.

457
00:49:40,510 --> 00:49:43,638
There's nothing else like it.

458
00:49:43,780 --> 00:49:48,012
l mean it, l'm thinking about
opening a restaurant.

459
00:49:48,151 --> 00:49:51,518
l haven't told anyone but you,
not even Milo.

460
00:49:51,955 --> 00:49:54,423
lt's top secret.

461
00:49:55,092 --> 00:49:57,652
But it's got to be the right place.

462
00:49:57,794 --> 00:50:01,628
- ln town?
- Yeah, if l can make it all happen.

463
00:50:04,234 --> 00:50:07,431
Then Milo can deliver the desserts.

464
00:50:07,571 --> 00:50:12,201
Don't tell me you like that stuff.
No way. . . He can't bake.

465
00:50:12,342 --> 00:50:17,370
- He doesn't eat them himself.
- l know why.

466
00:50:20,083 --> 00:50:23,541
- Frank. . .
- Do you have the money or not?

467
00:50:23,687 --> 00:50:27,316
- l thought we agreed. . .
- Fuck that, l need it now.

468
00:50:27,491 --> 00:50:32,861
- l can get it on the first.
- l need it now, not on the first.

469
00:50:33,230 --> 00:50:37,530
Don't touch me!
Let's see some fuckin' money.

470
00:50:41,905 --> 00:50:45,204
You've owed me 52 for a long time.
Why haven't you paid?

471
00:50:46,610 --> 00:50:51,570
l had some problems.
There's some things. . .

472
00:50:52,049 --> 00:50:54,017
You think it's a joke?

473
00:50:54,751 --> 00:50:59,017
- lt's not a game anymore.
- Calm down.

474
00:51:02,559 --> 00:51:06,893
lf you don't help me,
l can't help you. l need it now.

475
00:51:07,164 --> 00:51:11,362
- You used to play with my brother.
- Does your brother have the money?

476
00:51:13,070 --> 00:51:18,167
Then how can he help? He'll rip your
kneecaps out if you don't pay up.

477
00:51:25,782 --> 00:51:28,945
What am l gonna do with your watch?

478
00:51:30,720 --> 00:51:35,180
Deal with it, Joakim. lt's not
my money. l can't help you anymore.

479
00:51:45,135 --> 00:51:46,625
Take it easy. . .

480
00:51:51,141 --> 00:51:55,805
You're a swindler, huh?
Can you get it, or can't you?

481
00:51:57,614 --> 00:52:01,277
Listen, l know this sand-nigger,
he can get the money.

482
00:52:04,121 --> 00:52:07,989
Fuckin' Paki-lover. . .
lt's my money, do you understand?

483
00:52:08,892 --> 00:52:14,330
Can you get the money now?
Right now? Then l have an idea. . .

484
00:52:15,932 --> 00:52:20,995
- You can get the money at the bank.
- He can't rob a bank.

485
00:52:21,171 --> 00:52:26,108
- Anyone can rob a bank.
- He can't even hold that thing.

486
00:52:26,243 --> 00:52:33,149
- lt's 3:45, how can he rob a bank?
- That's it, the problem's solved.

487
00:52:33,750 --> 00:52:37,584
He can't rob a bank,
he doesn't have the balls.

488
00:52:37,754 --> 00:52:41,690
We just have time.
What bank do we rob?

489
00:52:42,259 --> 00:52:43,590
l don't care.

490
00:52:43,727 --> 00:52:47,959
- What bank do you use?
- No, he can't rob his own bank. . .

491
00:52:48,098 --> 00:52:53,331
- There's nothing else around.
- We'll do the first one we see.

492
00:52:53,470 --> 00:52:56,166
- What about. . .
- Let's go.

493
00:53:00,076 --> 00:53:03,603
- Easy, easy. . .
- Take it easy, man.

494
00:53:13,390 --> 00:53:18,885
lf you popped one of us, the other
would've blown your brains out.

495
00:53:19,763 --> 00:53:21,754
lt's time to go.

496
00:53:23,166 --> 00:53:25,225
Can l have a line?

497
00:53:25,402 --> 00:53:29,771
- Yeah, when you give us the money.
- Give him one now.

498
00:53:30,840 --> 00:53:36,472
- Just give him one. . .
- He gets shit until it's done.

499
00:53:36,813 --> 00:53:41,273
lt's 3:45, we gotta go.
Come on, Paki-lover.

500
00:54:27,731 --> 00:54:29,494
So, what do we do now?

501
00:54:36,873 --> 00:54:42,106
l'll tell Milo about it. Make sure
you have the money tomorrow.

502
00:54:42,345 --> 00:54:45,678
- Don't forget.
- l won't.

503
00:56:44,801 --> 00:56:46,735
- Sorry. . .
- Hi, Frank.

504
00:56:47,270 --> 00:56:50,103

00:56:50,240 --> 00:56:54,108

506
00:56:54,344 --> 00:56:56,437
- Okay.

507
00:56:57,347 --> 00:57:01,340
- What the fuck have l been hearing?
- What did you hear?

508
00:57:01,484 --> 00:57:05,284

510
00:57:09,426 --> 00:57:11,189
What the fuck's goin' on?

511
00:57:12,328 --> 00:57:13,488
You gonna dance?

512
00:57:16,633 --> 00:57:19,693
Christ, King got mega-fuckin' sick.

513
00:57:19,803 --> 00:57:23,671
He threw up all his food yesterday.
l got all paranoid.

514
00:57:23,807 --> 00:57:28,642
Right into a taxi and over to some
piss-ass expensive vet way uptown.

515
00:57:31,448 --> 00:57:33,746
- That's a bitch, huh?

534
00:59:22,625 --> 00:59:26,755
What would l do with a gun. . .?
But l could use a new phone.

- 800. When do you need it?

What's wrong?

542
01:01:08,064 --> 01:01:09,361
Nothing.

543
01:01:17,907 --> 01:01:20,569
What did that photographer

- You really want to know?
- Yeah. . .

545
01:01:34,824 --> 01:01:37,884
He asked
if l'd suck him off for 500.

546
01:01:43,199 --> 01:01:45,258
He thought l was a whore.

547
01:01:47,103 --> 01:01:48,297
Aren't you?

548
01:01:52,041 --> 01:01:55,272
l'm not a whore,
l'm a champagne girl.

549
01:01:59,782 --> 01:02:03,377
ls it any different,
getting fucked for 3,000 or 300?

550
01:02:05,688 --> 01:02:07,918
There's a big difference.

551
01:02:13,830 --> 01:02:17,061
l could be whatever l want,
l just don't feel like it.

552
