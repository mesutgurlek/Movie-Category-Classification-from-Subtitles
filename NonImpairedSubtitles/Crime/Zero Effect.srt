1
00:02:05,308 --> 00:02:06,605
<i>It's his uncompromising standard.</i>

2
00:02:07,677 --> 00:02:08,871
He never meets his clients.

3
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:12,971
He doesn't speak with them
or communicate directly.

4
00:02:13,183 --> 00:02:14,411
It's his policy.

5
00:02:14,617 --> 00:02:17,085
I'm his sole representative,
he's my only employer...

6
00:02:17,287 --> 00:02:21,747
...and I have full authorization to
speak on his behalf on all his business.

7
00:02:21,958 --> 00:02:24,688
I have with me
a signed letter to that effect.

8
00:02:25,795 --> 00:02:27,763
He doesn't negotiate his fee.

9
00:02:27,964 --> 00:02:29,795
He works at a flat rate.

10
00:02:32,969 --> 00:02:37,269
Under some unusual circumstances
he'll work pro bono. Never in between.

11
00:02:37,473 --> 00:02:40,374
I suppose I don't qualify
for the latter category.

12
00:02:40,710 --> 00:02:42,837
I haven't heard your proposal yet.

13
00:02:43,046 --> 00:02:46,447
I have a feeling that mine
is not a charity case.

14
00:02:46,649 --> 00:02:47,980
Most aren't.

15
00:02:48,985 --> 00:02:52,546
Mr. Arlo, you realize
this is all very strange.

16
00:02:53,156 --> 00:02:55,317
I mean, nobody in your field...

17
00:02:55,625 --> 00:02:59,117
...asks the kind of money
your employer does and nobody...

18
00:02:59,329 --> 00:03:01,297
...communicates via...

19
00:03:02,365 --> 00:03:05,129
...a messenger.
It's all very unusual.

20
00:03:05,435 --> 00:03:09,132
Let me tell you about the case of the
man with the mismatched shoelaces.

21
00:03:09,405 --> 00:03:12,033
Years ago, when I first
came into his employ...

22
00:03:12,242 --> 00:03:14,210
...he was contracted to find a man.

23
00:03:14,410 --> 00:03:16,469
I can't give much detail...

24
00:03:16,679 --> 00:03:19,876
...but believe me, if this man
had not been located...

25
00:03:20,083 --> 00:03:23,712
...our country's good diplomacy
with a certain economic superpower...

26
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:26,480
...might have a different face today.

27
00:03:26,756 --> 00:03:29,156
Federal, state, local authorities
all over the world...

28
00:03:29,359 --> 00:03:33,159
...searched for a face whose
significance they couldn't fathom.

29
00:03:33,363 --> 00:03:35,228
He'd vanished without a trace.

30
00:03:35,431 --> 00:03:39,162
On the 8th morning, a non-political
third party contacted me...

31
00:03:39,369 --> 00:03:41,394
...with an unrelated private agenda.

32
00:03:41,604 --> 00:03:46,234
My employer had never heard of this
missing man, knew nothing about him.

33
00:03:46,643 --> 00:03:49,203
After just one hour of desk work...

34
00:03:49,412 --> 00:03:52,245
...just an hour after accepting
the case...

35
00:03:52,615 --> 00:03:55,413
...he picked up the telephone
and placed a call.

36
00:03:55,852 --> 00:03:57,683
Guess who answered the phone.

37
00:03:59,255 --> 00:04:00,745
The missing man.

38
00:04:01,357 --> 00:04:03,917
The man with the mismatched shoelaces.

39
00:04:05,028 --> 00:04:07,189
Without ever leaving the house.

40
00:04:07,530 --> 00:04:09,293
<i>I'm telling you, he never even...</i>

41
00:04:09,499 --> 00:04:11,160
...leaves the house, okay?

42
00:04:11,367 --> 00:04:13,995
I mean, he's like some kind of recluse.

43
00:04:14,203 --> 00:04:16,262
A complete freak.

44
00:04:17,206 --> 00:04:18,935
No social life.

45
00:04:19,208 --> 00:04:20,903
In fact, no social skills.

46
00:04:21,110 --> 00:04:23,340
Fucking strange. When he works...

47
00:04:23,546 --> 00:04:25,571
...the smoothest operator you've seen.

48
00:04:25,782 --> 00:04:27,409
Brave, slick...

49
00:04:27,617 --> 00:04:28,845
...cunning...

50
00:04:29,052 --> 00:04:30,542
...do anything.

51
00:04:32,121 --> 00:04:33,884
Soon as he gets off work...

52
00:04:34,724 --> 00:04:36,055
...it's all gone.

53
00:04:36,392 --> 00:04:38,622
Afraid to go to the dry cleaners.

54
00:04:38,895 --> 00:04:40,226
Literally.

55
00:04:40,964 --> 00:04:44,058
Too uncomfortable in his own skin
to go out and eat.

56
00:04:46,235 --> 00:04:47,725
Tactless...

57
00:04:48,571 --> 00:04:50,129
...and inept.

58
00:04:52,475 --> 00:04:55,342
Rude too.
Just an asshole.

59
00:04:56,145 --> 00:04:59,774
You could meet him 5 times
and not realize it's the same person.

60
00:04:59,983 --> 00:05:03,441
He can tell you where you were born,
how old your mother was at the time...

61
00:05:03,653 --> 00:05:07,214
...and what you had for breakfast,
all within 30 seconds of meeting you.

62
00:05:07,423 --> 00:05:11,792
He can get a criminal to confess without
his realizing he's being questioned.

63
00:05:12,996 --> 00:05:14,588
How does he do it?

64
00:05:15,098 --> 00:05:18,829
He has a deeply nuanced and functional
understanding of human behavior...

65
00:05:19,035 --> 00:05:22,402
...to rival the great psychoanalytical
minds of our time.

66
00:05:22,605 --> 00:05:25,665
He understands the criminal mind
as well as the innocent mind...

67
00:05:25,875 --> 00:05:29,675
...the stable mind as well as the
psychotic, sociopathic mind...

68
00:05:29,879 --> 00:05:32,541
...the male as well as the female.

69
00:05:32,882 --> 00:05:34,144
<i>I don't think he's ever...</i>

70
00:05:34,350 --> 00:05:35,544
...kissed a girl.

71
00:05:36,052 --> 00:05:38,316
He's thirty-something years old.

72
00:05:38,788 --> 00:05:41,279
What does he do when he's not working?

73
00:05:41,557 --> 00:05:43,957
Does he just sit around the house?

74
00:05:44,761 --> 00:05:47,594
When private investigation
won its most worthy champion...

75
00:05:47,797 --> 00:05:51,756
...academia and the arts
suffered a loss, a great loss.

76
00:05:51,968 --> 00:05:56,132
In addition to his many scholarly gifts,
he's a terrifically talented musician.

77
00:05:57,306 --> 00:05:59,137
He writes songs.

78
00:05:59,642 --> 00:06:01,234
He's terrible.

79
00:06:01,811 --> 00:06:05,110
His metaphors are thin,
his imagery is cliched...

80
00:06:05,314 --> 00:06:08,750
...and his thematic material is trite
and heavy-handed.

81
00:06:09,485 --> 00:06:11,146
Why do you do it?

82
00:06:12,822 --> 00:06:15,814
I left the firm, didn't know
what I was going to do...

83
00:06:17,326 --> 00:06:19,920
...and I get this message on my machine.

84
00:06:20,930 --> 00:06:23,490
He'd watched me argue a case in court...

85
00:06:24,167 --> 00:06:28,433
...said I was the only person for the job.
I don't know. The guy's nuts, okay?

86
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:31,998
What's his name?

87
00:06:32,675 --> 00:06:34,142
The mysterious...

88
00:06:34,343 --> 00:06:36,607
...and brilliant Daryl Zero.

89
00:06:37,447 --> 00:06:40,473
Certainly does take himself
seriously, doesn't he?

90
00:06:45,688 --> 00:06:47,280
All right, Mr. Arlo.

91
00:06:49,125 --> 00:06:50,524
I'm sold.

92
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:52,359
What happens now?

93
00:06:53,863 --> 00:06:56,229
You tell me how my employer
can be of service...

94
00:06:56,432 --> 00:06:58,423
...then I fly home and speak to him.

95
00:07:00,136 --> 00:07:01,467
Where is home?

96
00:07:01,971 --> 00:07:04,371
Not to be coy,
but I can't tell you that.

97
00:07:04,574 --> 00:07:06,064
Of course not.

98
00:07:06,976 --> 00:07:09,877
You know, I'm not used
to being in this position.

99
00:07:10,313 --> 00:07:11,541
Being needy.

100
00:07:11,881 --> 00:07:13,371
I understand.

101
00:07:15,051 --> 00:07:16,313
Yes.

102
00:07:17,553 --> 00:07:19,680
You know, it's of the
utmost importance...

103
00:07:19,889 --> 00:07:23,120
...what I'm about to tell you
not leave your confidence...

104
00:07:23,326 --> 00:07:24,987
...or that of your...

105
00:07:26,062 --> 00:07:27,689
...inaccessible employer.

106
00:07:28,397 --> 00:07:30,058
That I can guarantee.

107
00:07:30,666 --> 00:07:34,227
Mr. Arlo, I have lost my keys
and I need to find them.

108
00:07:35,238 --> 00:07:37,399
I'm being blackmailed, Mr. Arlo.

109
00:07:37,907 --> 00:07:41,343
It's cost me a good deal
of money and many nights' sleep.

110
00:07:42,345 --> 00:07:44,040
I need the matter resolved.

111
00:07:44,247 --> 00:07:48,047
I need questions answered
and I must know who stole the key...

112
00:07:48,251 --> 00:07:50,185
...to my safe deposit box.

113
00:08:03,032 --> 00:08:04,499
Mr. Arlo, good to see you.

114
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:07,669
Thanks, Rahim. Keep it close.
I'll be 20 minutes.

115
00:08:07,870 --> 00:08:09,064
We'll keep it up top.

116
00:08:09,272 --> 00:08:10,933
Great. Thanks, Raoul.

117
00:08:21,384 --> 00:08:24,376
<i>If I come a-knocking...</i>

118
00:08:25,621 --> 00:08:28,112
<i>... a-knocking at your door</i>

119
00:09:09,832 --> 00:09:12,323
<i>... on this October day</i>

120
00:09:13,169 --> 00:09:15,797
<i>Would you say, "It'd be a joy</i>

121
00:09:16,005 --> 00:09:18,303
<i>With you, my good boy"</i>

122
00:09:18,507 --> 00:09:20,941
<i>'Cause if you would...</i>

123
00:09:21,177 --> 00:09:23,008
<i>I'd say,</i>

124
00:09:26,682 --> 00:09:27,979
<i>"Let's run off...</i>

125
00:09:28,184 --> 00:09:29,674

00:09:47,303 --> 00:09:48,600
<i>... on a rainy afternoon</i>

00:09:48,804 --> 00:09:51,272

134
00:09:51,474 --> 00:09:54,841
<i>And whistle a merry tune</i>

135
00:09:55,044 --> 00:09:57,706
<i>And if I'd pop the question</i>

136
00:09:58,547 --> 00:10:01,015
<i>Straight from my heart</i>

137
00:10:01,217 --> 00:10:02,946

138
00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:08,384
<i>..."Let's run away

139
00:10:08,658 --> 00:10:12,651

140
00:10:14,664 --> 00:10:16,359

That's good.

148
00:10:59,041 --> 00:11:00,201
It's really good.

149
00:11:05,881 --> 00:11:07,212
You like it.

150
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:20,895
I had the first verse a while ago...

151
00:11:23,065 --> 00:11:25,226
...but I just got that second one...

152
00:11:27,136 --> 00:11:29,229
...just a couple hours ago.

153
00:11:29,972 --> 00:11:32,304
- You really like it?
- Yeah.

154
00:11:37,079 --> 00:11:39,809
Where the fuck have you been?

155
00:11:41,150 --> 00:11:42,412
What do you mean?

156
00:11:42,651 --> 00:11:45,745
Where the fuck have you been?

157
00:11:46,255 --> 00:11:47,813
I've been waiting for you.

158
00:11:48,424 --> 00:11:50,654
I came straight from the airport.

159
00:11:52,094 --> 00:11:54,995
I've been awake for three days.

160
00:11:55,598 --> 00:11:56,826
Three!

161
00:12:00,336 --> 00:12:02,531
Just love those amphetamines.

162
00:12:05,441 --> 00:12:06,931
Got to love them.

163
00:12:07,777 --> 00:12:08,607
Got to.

164
00:12:09,445 --> 00:12:10,844
Sounds healthy.

165
00:12:11,347 --> 00:12:13,281
It's good for my skin.

166
00:12:15,351 --> 00:12:18,218
If you do enough of that stuff
over a short period of time...

167
00:12:18,421 --> 00:12:21,322
...you get these canker
sores on your tongue.

168
00:12:21,524 --> 00:12:22,923
They bleed and...

169
00:12:23,125 --> 00:12:24,092
See?

170
00:12:24,293 --> 00:12:25,783
Disgusting.

171
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:32,700
What'd the guy in Portland want?

172
00:12:33,202 --> 00:12:34,464
Blackmail.

173
00:12:37,306 --> 00:12:39,001
- Name?
- Stark.

174
00:12:39,208 --> 00:12:41,699
Gregory Stark, Oregon Timber.

175
00:12:44,146 --> 00:12:45,773
He's a very rich man.

176
00:12:45,981 --> 00:12:47,380
Old money.

177
00:12:49,318 --> 00:12:50,808
Blackmail, huh?

178
00:12:53,389 --> 00:12:55,357
Did he kill somebody
or fuck somebody?

179
00:12:55,558 --> 00:12:59,289
Fucked somebody over.
Sounds like embezzlement, maybe.

180
00:12:59,495 --> 00:13:02,191
Runs in the family, I guess.
His old man, Jordan...

181
00:13:02,398 --> 00:13:05,196
...had a big tax evasion suit
against him in '82.

182
00:13:05,401 --> 00:13:10,168
He was legally exonerated but karmically
convicted because he died right after.

183
00:13:10,506 --> 00:13:12,667
It was a massive coronary.

184
00:13:13,409 --> 00:13:16,810
He just didn't take care of himself.
He ate like a pig.

185
00:13:17,012 --> 00:13:18,639
He was just a fat man.

186
00:13:18,848 --> 00:13:22,511
Gregory Stark is the son of a fat man.

187
00:13:23,586 --> 00:13:26,521
You wouldn't be the first hound
down this trail.

188
00:13:28,190 --> 00:13:30,090
- Who?
- Clearburg.

189
00:13:30,426 --> 00:13:32,894
- Didn't turn a thing.
- Fucking hack!

190
00:13:33,095 --> 00:13:35,325
You know the trouble
with fucking Clearburg?

191
00:13:35,531 --> 00:13:38,227
He has absolutely no fucking tact.

192
00:13:38,434 --> 00:13:42,234
He stinks up the whole neighborhood.
And he's press hungry.

193
00:13:42,438 --> 00:13:44,599
He's just repulsive.

194
00:13:45,407 --> 00:13:48,706
Gregory Stark. How desperate?
Scale of 1 to 10.

195
00:13:48,944 --> 00:13:50,707
Bordering on manic.

196
00:13:52,381 --> 00:13:54,713
Do I need to go there?

197
00:13:55,117 --> 00:13:56,675
You'd want to check it out.

198
00:13:56,886 --> 00:13:58,683
There isn't too much to go on here.

199
00:13:59,388 --> 00:14:01,253
I'd have to go there?

200
00:14:01,457 --> 00:14:02,788
I don't like it.

201
00:14:03,726 --> 00:14:06,718
Fuck it! Sure. Yeah.
Tell him I'll do it.

202
00:14:07,796 --> 00:14:10,890
Wait. Don't you even want
to hear what it is?

203
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:13,563
What is it today?

204
00:14:15,237 --> 00:14:16,636
What day is it?

205
00:14:16,972 --> 00:14:18,405
Sunday.

206
00:14:19,074 --> 00:14:21,702
I'll get on the plane to Portland...

207
00:14:21,911 --> 00:14:23,879
...at 11: 15 tonight...

208
00:14:24,079 --> 00:14:27,571
...arriving Portland at 1:32 am.

209
00:14:27,783 --> 00:14:31,219
You'll give me the details on the way
to the airport tonight.

210
00:14:31,420 --> 00:14:33,581
- Wait a minute. Tonight?
- Yeah. 10:00.

211
00:14:33,789 --> 00:14:37,156
Can't it wait till tomorrow?
I can have one night with Jess?

212
00:14:37,826 --> 00:14:39,726
No, you'll go tomorrow...

213
00:14:39,929 --> 00:14:42,397
...at 7:36 a. M...

214
00:14:42,598 --> 00:14:45,829
...because I need you to drive me
to the airport tonight...

215
00:14:46,035 --> 00:14:47,866
...at 10:00.

216
00:14:48,337 --> 00:14:51,170
Do you want that low-cal breakfast?

217
00:14:54,510 --> 00:14:57,138
My abilities are seriously impaired...

218
00:14:57,346 --> 00:14:59,405
...maybe even disabled...

219
00:14:59,615 --> 00:15:01,276
...right at the moment.

220
00:15:02,685 --> 00:15:04,084
Because I got to...

221
00:15:04,286 --> 00:15:06,618
...get to sleep right now.

222
00:15:07,856 --> 00:15:10,324
- Daryl.
- I'll see you at 10:00.

223
00:15:36,885 --> 00:15:38,045
Jess?

224
00:16:28,604 --> 00:16:29,832
You're all wet.

225
00:16:30,039 --> 00:16:31,370
I don't care.

226
00:16:32,875 --> 00:16:35,776
- Thank you for the flowers.
- You're welcome.

227
00:16:37,379 --> 00:16:38,710
You want to come in?

228
00:16:45,788 --> 00:16:47,449
I'm glad you're back.

229
00:16:47,890 --> 00:16:49,619
I'm glad to be back.

230
00:16:51,226 --> 00:16:53,717
Where are you taking me tonight?

231
00:17:02,471 --> 00:17:03,904
Jesus.

232
00:17:12,247 --> 00:17:13,942
<i>He wouldn't say what's in the box.</i>

233
00:17:14,149 --> 00:17:18,381
It sounds like some sort of financial
record, but he didn't want to tell me.

234
00:17:18,587 --> 00:17:21,784
So whatever he's hiding,
he keeps it in a safe deposit box.

235
00:17:21,990 --> 00:17:25,721
But then he keeps the key to the box
cleverly hidden on his key ring...

236
00:17:25,928 --> 00:17:28,556
...with his car keys and his house keys?

237
00:17:28,764 --> 00:17:30,925
I'm telling you what he said.

238
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:34,594
So anyway, about a year ago...
It'll be a year on the 12th...

239
00:17:35,337 --> 00:17:37,965
...he loses his keys.
They had a gold-plated...

240
00:17:38,173 --> 00:17:40,733
<i>... Swiss Army knife attached.
A couple days pass.</i>

241
00:17:40,943 --> 00:17:44,140
<i>- He gets a little panicky.
- Flight 2064 to Portland.</i>

242
00:17:44,346 --> 00:17:46,871
Harold Burges.

243
00:17:47,182 --> 00:17:49,980
Then on June 23rd,
he gets a letter at the office.

244
00:17:50,185 --> 00:17:53,586
Comes FedEx.
Stamped "Personal and Confidential."

245
00:17:53,789 --> 00:17:56,758
Sender's name marked as
"Past Due Collections."

246
00:17:56,959 --> 00:17:58,085
That's nice.

247
00:17:58,293 --> 00:17:59,817
Laser-printed, not very long.

248
00:18:00,028 --> 00:18:03,327
Starts out: "Mr. Stark, I have evidence
linking you to your crime.

249
00:18:03,532 --> 00:18:07,662
You may entertain notions of impunity.
But in the end everyone is culpable."

250
00:18:07,870 --> 00:18:10,839
There's a succession of
$ 100,000 payments to be collected.

251
00:18:11,039 --> 00:18:12,768
He gets letters
which lay out a maze...

252
00:18:12,975 --> 00:18:17,275
<i>... and at the end of the maze he makes
the drop. He's done it 7 times so far.</i>

253
00:18:17,479 --> 00:18:19,947
He gave me copies of the letters
which are in a file...

254
00:18:20,149 --> 00:18:24,279
...that I'm putting in your briefcase
with the case file.

255
00:18:24,820 --> 00:18:27,789
There's a drop tomorrow.
I said he should plan...

256
00:18:27,990 --> 00:18:29,457
...to go through with it.

257
00:18:29,658 --> 00:18:30,682
Good.

258
00:18:31,393 --> 00:18:36,023
There's a lack-of-information
problem here, and he won't say much.

259
00:18:36,231 --> 00:18:38,791
- What's wrong with these people?
- I said not to lie.

260
00:18:39,001 --> 00:18:42,368
Eventually you always figure it out.
It just slows things down.

261
00:18:42,571 --> 00:18:45,199
You mention the case
of the guy who lied about his age?

262
00:18:45,407 --> 00:18:46,533
Of course.

263
00:18:46,742 --> 00:18:48,403
Was he impressed?

264
00:18:50,813 --> 00:18:52,246
Really impressed?

265
00:18:53,248 --> 00:18:55,239
Fucking flabbergasted.

266
00:18:56,084 --> 00:18:58,484
I think if you look truthfully
you'll see...

267
00:18:58,687 --> 00:19:01,053
...you maybe moved in
with her prematurely.

268
00:19:01,523 --> 00:19:02,581
What?

269
00:19:03,258 --> 00:19:05,886
You heard me.
Your problems with Jess...

270
00:19:06,094 --> 00:19:07,584
...aren't my fault.

271
00:19:07,930 --> 00:19:10,490
Could we please
not talk about this now?

272
00:19:10,699 --> 00:19:14,430
You're not ready to get married and
I think you should look at that and...

273
00:19:14,636 --> 00:19:15,796
Please?

274
00:19:19,374 --> 00:19:23,868
<i>I'm thinking maybe I should get
in touch with Hodgemeyer for this case.</i>

275
00:19:25,214 --> 00:19:26,806
Reservation for Hodgemeyer...

276
00:19:27,115 --> 00:19:28,241
...Mitchell...

277
00:19:28,450 --> 00:19:29,542
...Hodgemeyer.

278
00:19:30,385 --> 00:19:32,285
This guy will be a pain in the ass.

279
00:19:32,554 --> 00:19:35,216
- Try to figure out which bank it is.
- All right.

280
00:19:36,792 --> 00:19:40,523
We got one shot to break through this.
Tomorrow afternoon.

281
00:19:40,729 --> 00:19:42,788
That's about the size of it.

282
00:19:45,133 --> 00:19:46,794
Easy enough.

283
00:19:49,805 --> 00:19:52,831
<i>It's not without serious
reservation that I begin...</i>

284
00:19:53,041 --> 00:19:55,339
<i>... the seemingly impossible task...</i>

285
00:19:55,544 --> 00:19:58,308
<i>... of documenting my own methods.</i>

286
00:19:58,981 --> 00:20:00,346
<i>It always seemed that...</i>

287
00:20:00,549 --> 00:20:02,210
<i>... someone else should do it.</i>

288
00:20:02,484 --> 00:20:05,578
<i>Unfortunately, my faithful
legal representative...</i>

289
00:20:05,787 --> 00:20:08,722
<i>... has shown no interest whatsoever.</i>

290
00:20:08,991 --> 00:20:12,620
<i>And so I am forced
to take on the task myself...</i>

291
00:20:12,828 --> 00:20:14,295
<i>... with no intention...</i>

292
00:20:14,496 --> 00:20:19,195
<i>... of glorifying or aggrandizing
or immortalizing my own memory...</i>

293
00:20:19,401 --> 00:20:20,959
<i>... but rather in the hope...</i>

294
00:20:21,169 --> 00:20:23,194
<i>... that such a memoir might someday...</i>

295
00:20:23,405 --> 00:20:24,736
<i>... be useful to others.</i>

296
00:20:25,173 --> 00:20:27,073
<i>I begin my examination...</i>

297
00:20:27,342 --> 00:20:28,741
<i>... of the method.</i>

298
00:20:29,711 --> 00:20:32,202
<i>I always say my work
relies fundamentally...</i>

299
00:20:32,414 --> 00:20:34,473
<i>... on two basic principles:</i>

300
00:20:35,250 --> 00:20:38,219
<i>Objectivity and observation.</i>

301
00:20:38,420 --> 00:20:40,911
<i>Or the 2 Obs, as I call them.</i>

302
00:20:43,926 --> 00:20:47,157
<i>My work relies on my ability
to remain absolutely...</i>

303
00:20:47,362 --> 00:20:48,488
<i>... purely...</i>

304
00:20:48,697 --> 00:20:49,755
<i>... objective.</i>

305
00:20:50,265 --> 00:20:51,596
<i>Detached.</i>

306
00:20:54,536 --> 00:20:56,163
<i>I have mastered...</i>

307
00:20:56,371 --> 00:20:57,565
<i>... the fine art...</i>

308
00:20:57,773 --> 00:20:59,035
<i>... of detachment.</i>

309
00:20:59,374 --> 00:21:02,077
<i>And while it comes at some cost...</i>

310
00:21:02,077 --> 00:21:04,443
<i>... this supreme objectivity is what
makes me...</i>

311
00:21:05,180 --> 00:21:09,844
<i>... I dare say, the greatest observer
the world has ever known.</i>

312
00:21:36,478 --> 00:21:39,447
<i>Observing a subject,
particularly a client...</i>

313
00:21:39,648 --> 00:21:44,017
<i>... in his or her own element
is usually very telling.</i>

314
00:21:44,219 --> 00:21:48,519
<i>Behavior is always more revealing
than language...</i>

315
00:21:48,657 --> 00:21:50,648
<i>... if you know what to look for.</i>

316
00:21:53,662 --> 00:21:56,426
No rain. Would you believe it?

317
00:21:56,999 --> 00:21:58,830
What? You talking to me?

318
00:21:59,167 --> 00:22:03,433
I said, would you believe
it finally stopped raining?

319
00:22:10,946 --> 00:22:14,677
What are you doing over there,
if you don't mind my asking? Level 8?

320
00:22:14,816 --> 00:22:16,010
What?

321
00:22:16,785 --> 00:22:18,946
Are you doing about an 8?

322
00:22:19,354 --> 00:22:20,321
Seven.

323
00:22:20,522 --> 00:22:21,489
Seven.

324
00:22:21,690 --> 00:22:22,850
That's funny.

325
00:22:23,125 --> 00:22:24,615
That's what I'm doing.

326
00:22:26,695 --> 00:22:27,787
What?

327
00:22:28,797 --> 00:22:30,697
Nothing. I didn't say anything.

328
00:22:32,968 --> 00:22:34,458
Name's Carmine.

329
00:22:35,537 --> 00:22:38,131
- Nick Carmine.
- Greg Stark.

330
00:22:39,141 --> 00:22:41,701
Real pleasure to make
your acquaintance, Stark.

331
00:22:41,977 --> 00:22:43,035
Likewise.

332
00:23:15,243 --> 00:23:17,143
You're right, but remember...

333
00:23:17,345 --> 00:23:20,371
...since Maxwell's gone,
we don't have a fast break.

334
00:23:20,582 --> 00:23:23,745
No team's gotten to the finals
without a fast break.

335
00:23:24,086 --> 00:23:25,553
The Celtics...

336
00:23:25,754 --> 00:23:27,187
...of the mid-80's...

337
00:23:27,589 --> 00:23:29,352
...had no fast break.

338
00:23:30,258 --> 00:23:31,589
That's true.

339
00:23:32,094 --> 00:23:33,493
They were a slow team.

340
00:23:33,695 --> 00:23:37,654
One of the best shooting teams.
I know. I went to school in Cambridge.

341
00:23:37,866 --> 00:23:40,391
The Starks are a long dynasty
of Celtic fans.

342
00:23:42,938 --> 00:23:45,270
This is my good friend Gerald Auerbach.

343
00:23:45,974 --> 00:23:47,305
Nick Carmine.

344
00:23:51,146 --> 00:23:53,614
How was everything for you, Mr. Carmine?

345
00:23:53,815 --> 00:23:55,009
Terrific.

346
00:23:55,217 --> 00:23:58,778
Daisy, could I book
a massage for tomorrow morning?

347
00:23:58,987 --> 00:24:00,648
Sure, no problem.

348
00:24:01,556 --> 00:24:03,319
Betsy comes highly recommended.

349
00:24:03,959 --> 00:24:06,052
Betsy is excellent.

350
00:24:07,662 --> 00:24:09,323
How about 9:00?

351
00:24:10,832 --> 00:24:13,699
Betsy has an appointment
every morning at 9:00.

352
00:24:13,902 --> 00:24:15,164
How about 10:00?

353
00:24:16,071 --> 00:24:18,005
That's the time I wanted.

354
00:24:18,507 --> 00:24:20,998
- Sorry.
- It's all right. You beat me to it.

355
00:24:24,846 --> 00:24:26,575
Are you a paramedic?

356
00:24:27,249 --> 00:24:29,911
Yes. How did you know that?

357
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:32,919
Just a hunch.

358
00:24:33,255 --> 00:24:36,349
What do you mean, just a hunch?
How did you know?

359
00:24:41,396 --> 00:24:42,886
I'm very intuitive.

360
00:24:45,433 --> 00:24:48,061
Give this lady the 10:00 massage.

361
00:24:48,270 --> 00:24:51,103
You take it.
You need it more than I do.

362
00:24:51,373 --> 00:24:52,863
What does that mean?

363
00:24:55,610 --> 00:24:57,271
What'd she mean?

364
00:24:58,780 --> 00:25:00,338
Who was that?

365
00:25:00,549 --> 00:25:02,881
Her name is Gloria Sullivan.

366
00:25:03,485 --> 00:25:04,417
She's not married.

367
00:25:07,055 --> 00:25:08,545
Fantastic.

368
00:25:25,073 --> 00:25:26,973
Wait at the end.

369
00:25:58,006 --> 00:25:59,974
I really hope you're being followed.

370
00:26:00,175 --> 00:26:01,608
You can't be too careful...

371
00:26:02,210 --> 00:26:04,644
...because we need to talk now.

372
00:26:04,846 --> 00:26:06,177
First of all...

373
00:26:07,115 --> 00:26:08,480
...how was your trip?

374
00:26:09,517 --> 00:26:10,745
Fine.

375
00:26:11,453 --> 00:26:12,579
Good.

376
00:26:12,787 --> 00:26:14,914
I just left Stark at the gym.

377
00:26:15,123 --> 00:26:17,591
Some major revelations. Guy's a mess.

378
00:26:17,792 --> 00:26:20,761
Somebody's holding something
serious over his head...

379
00:26:20,962 --> 00:26:22,793
...and I don't think it's about money.

380
00:26:23,531 --> 00:26:26,091
<i>He doesn't move
like a white-collar criminal.</i>

381
00:26:26,301 --> 00:26:28,496
<i>When he walks, his shoulders...</i>

382
00:26:28,703 --> 00:26:30,261
<i>... ride at ear level.</i>

383
00:26:30,472 --> 00:26:34,431
<i>Also, he cut himself shaving
3 times in the last 10 days or so.</i>

384
00:26:34,943 --> 00:26:38,811
These are symptoms
of a deeply ingrained paranoid fear.

385
00:26:39,547 --> 00:26:41,344
Fear of being found out.

386
00:26:41,549 --> 00:26:46,111
<i>I get on the treadmill next to his and I
get my machine going at his exact pace.</i>

387
00:26:46,321 --> 00:26:48,516
<i>I ask him what level he's running at.</i>

388
00:26:48,823 --> 00:26:52,020
<i>I guess 8. He says level 7.</i>

389
00:26:52,227 --> 00:26:54,787
<i>I'm running at the same speed he is.</i>

390
00:26:54,996 --> 00:26:56,395
<i>Level 5.</i>

391
00:26:56,765 --> 00:26:59,029
<i>He'd sooner lie to
a complete stranger...</i>

392
00:26:59,234 --> 00:27:02,397
<i>... than to admit to being
3 levels below my guess.</i>

393
00:27:02,671 --> 00:27:05,299
<i>As soon as I talk to him,
he runs the other way.</i>

394
00:27:05,507 --> 00:27:07,372
<i>It's conditioning, though.
A reflex.</i>

395
00:27:07,575 --> 00:27:11,534
He obviously didn't think to connect me
to the blackmail business at all.

396
00:27:11,780 --> 00:27:13,475
<i>If he'd suspected me...</i>

397
00:27:13,715 --> 00:27:16,548
<i>... he would have remembered my name,
which he didn't.</i>

398
00:27:16,751 --> 00:27:21,313
Also, like most lvy League graduates,
he drops his alma mater with...

399
00:27:21,523 --> 00:27:23,650
...almost no prompting whatsoever.

400
00:27:23,992 --> 00:27:27,018
<i>I say Celtics, he says Cambridge.</i>

401
00:27:27,295 --> 00:27:32,028
<i>Oh yeah, the gentleman prefers redheads.
He lusts after his red-haired masseuse.</i>

402
00:27:32,867 --> 00:27:34,994
<i>You can tell by the way
he takes his massage.</i>

403
00:27:35,203 --> 00:27:37,171
<i>It's more than a little eroticized.</i>

404
00:27:37,472 --> 00:27:40,407
<i>He does it every day at the same time
with the same woman.</i>

405
00:27:40,608 --> 00:27:43,441
<i>I found an e-mail message
from Clearburg.</i>

406
00:27:43,645 --> 00:27:45,340
<i>Kind of cryptic. Note said...</i>

407
00:27:45,547 --> 00:27:49,039
<i>..."Thorough check finds no boxer
with the name K. V. "</i>

408
00:27:49,451 --> 00:27:53,251
K.V. Are obviously initials. We have to
figure out what they stand for.

409
00:27:54,055 --> 00:27:56,114
<i>Lets see, what else?</i>

410
00:27:57,225 --> 00:27:59,125
<i>That's the important stuff.</i>

411
00:28:01,830 --> 00:28:02,990
It's Sergio.

412
00:28:03,565 --> 00:28:05,089
Sergio Knight.

413
00:28:05,300 --> 00:28:07,200
Right. Whatever.

414
00:28:07,435 --> 00:28:08,663
Can I ask you a question?

415
00:28:10,472 --> 00:28:11,632
What's that?

416
00:28:12,073 --> 00:28:13,973
Why are we talking on the phone?

417
00:28:14,242 --> 00:28:17,109
I told you. We can't be too careful.

418
00:28:17,312 --> 00:28:18,540
Two guys...

419
00:28:18,747 --> 00:28:20,044
...in an airport...

420
00:28:20,248 --> 00:28:21,408
...talking?

421
00:28:22,250 --> 00:28:23,581
It's a little fishy.

422
00:28:23,818 --> 00:28:27,049
Why are we even in an airport?
Why don't we just leave?

423
00:28:27,288 --> 00:28:28,983
Okay, I see the confusion.

424
00:28:29,257 --> 00:28:30,622
I need more research.

425
00:28:30,825 --> 00:28:33,953
I need you to go back to L.A.
And get in the computer.

426
00:28:34,162 --> 00:28:38,462
<i>Then break into Clearburg's
computer and pull anything pertinent.</i>

427
00:28:38,666 --> 00:28:42,397
<i>I've written elaborate directions.
They're in the phone book.</i>

428
00:28:42,604 --> 00:28:44,629
<i>In front of you. Turn to Rentals.</i>

429
00:28:44,839 --> 00:28:47,569
I'll meet you at the motel tonight
when you get back.

430
00:28:47,776 --> 00:28:51,075
Instead of calling me,
you had me fly up here to tell me...

431
00:28:51,279 --> 00:28:54,646
...to go back to the computer
and then fly back again tonight?

432
00:28:54,849 --> 00:28:59,582
It wasn't an emergency. There was no
reason to risk the long-distance lines.

433
00:28:59,788 --> 00:29:01,312
They listen, you know.

434
00:29:05,527 --> 00:29:07,290
<i>Are you still there?</i>

435
00:29:25,313 --> 00:29:26,439
<i>Here we go.</i>

436
00:29:27,882 --> 00:29:30,646
<i>"Transaction instructions
for this Monday night.</i>

437
00:29:37,559 --> 00:29:39,789
<i>$ 100,000 cash...</i>

438
00:29:39,994 --> 00:29:43,191
<i>... transported in a discreet
black leather bag...</i>

439
00:29:43,398 --> 00:29:46,128
<i>... that you shall provide for yourself.</i>

440
00:29:46,534 --> 00:29:49,025
<i>Wear your business suit
and your gray overcoat.</i>

441

<i>Carry the enclosed pager set to the...</i>

<i>Leave the office at 5 p.m.</i>

445

<i>Your course is as follows:</i>

446

<i>Number 1:</i>

447
00:30:05,620 --> 00:30:10,353
<i>At 5:30 p.m., be at the intersection
of Powell and Green with the cash.</i>

<i>2: When the clock
in your car reads 5:34...</i>

449
00:30:20,101 --> 00:30:23,195
<i>... begin driving northbound up Powell.</i>

450
00:30:29,410 --> 00:30:33,278
<i>Number 3: Pager will go off,
displaying 6 digits.</i>

451
00:30:33,548 --> 00:30:35,675
<i>When your vehicle's odometer reads...</i>

452
00:30:35,884 --> 00:30:38,352
<i>... the same overall mileage,
pull over and park...</i>

453
00:30:38,553 --> 00:30:39,577
<i>... ASAP.</i>

<i>... bus stop, same side of the street.</i>

456

<i>Get on the next bus.</i>

<i>Five:</i>

<i>Pager will deliver a 3-digit number.</i>

<i>Get off the bus at the next stop,
cross the street...</i>

460
00:31:04,312 --> 00:31:06,712
<i>... get on the train
with the painted number...</i>

461
00:31:06,948 --> 00:31:09,815
<i>... that corresponds
with the pager message.</i>

462

<i>Enter the first possible men's room.</i>

<i>... replace in tank...</i>

<i>... walk outside

475
00:32:20,221 --> 00:32:21,882
<i>... then leave immediately.</i>

476
00:32:22,390 --> 00:32:26,156
<i>You have 3 minutes to get out
of the building from the time you enter.</i>

477
00:32:28,496 --> 00:32:30,521
<i>You are not to be accompanied...</i>

478
00:32:30,732 --> 00:32:34,190
<i>... you are not to be followed.
Your complete cooperation..."</i>

479
00:32:34,402 --> 00:32:36,495
<i>Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.</i>

480
00:32:37,505 --> 00:32:40,736
<i>A few words here
about following people.</i>

481
00:32:41,576 --> 00:32:44,010
<i>People know they're being followed
when they turn...</i>

482
00:32:44,212 --> 00:32:46,271
<i>... and see someone following them.</i>

483
00:32:47,181 --> 00:32:51,015
<i>They can't tell they're being followed
if you get there first.</i>

484
00:33:26,054 --> 00:33:28,022
Okay folks, that's the fire alarm.

485
00:33:28,222 --> 00:33:30,315
Everybody must leave the building.

486
00:33:30,525 --> 00:33:32,584
Please, do not run.

487
00:35:49,764 --> 00:35:51,595
Gloria Sullivan.

488
00:35:56,771 --> 00:35:58,068
You Arlo?

489
00:35:58,272 --> 00:36:00,866
That other guy left this for you.
That Olson?

490
00:36:03,611 --> 00:36:05,636
He has a strange personality.

491
00:36:15,223 --> 00:36:20,126
<i>I can't possibly overstate
the importance of good research.</i>

492
00:36:20,795 --> 00:36:23,764
<i>Everyone goes through life
dropping crumbs.</i>

493
00:36:23,965 --> 00:36:28,368
<i>Recognize the crumbs and you can trace
a path from your death certificate...</i>

494
00:36:28,569 --> 00:36:32,471
<i>... to the dinner and movie
that resulted in you in the first place.</i>

495
00:36:32,974 --> 00:36:34,874
<i>But research is an art...</i>

496
00:36:35,076 --> 00:36:36,270
<i>... not a science.</i>

497
00:36:36,777 --> 00:36:39,610
<i>Because anyone can find the crumbs...</i>

498
00:36:39,814 --> 00:36:42,476
<i>... the wheres, whats and whos.</i>

499
00:36:42,750 --> 00:36:44,615
<i>The art is in the whys...</i>

500
00:36:44,819 --> 00:36:47,879
<i>... the ability to read
between the crumbs...</i>

501
00:36:48,089 --> 00:36:50,080
<i>... not to mix metaphors.</i>

502
00:36:51,092 --> 00:36:53,959
<i>For every event,
there is a cause and effect.</i>

503
00:36:54,161 --> 00:36:56,823
<i>For every crime a motive.</i>

504
00:36:57,665 --> 00:37:00,099
<i>And for every motive, a passion.</i>

505
00:37:01,168 --> 00:37:04,399
<i>The art of research is the ability
to look at the details...</i>

506
00:37:05,106 --> 00:37:06,835
<i>... and see the passion.</i>

507
00:38:20,181 --> 00:38:21,205
Excuse me.

508
00:38:21,415 --> 00:38:23,747
Okay, so, you have to tell me now.

509
00:38:23,951 --> 00:38:27,182
Yesterday, how could you
tell that I was a paramedic?

510
00:38:28,856 --> 00:38:30,517
You really want to know?

511
00:38:33,194 --> 00:38:35,025
I could smell it.

512
00:38:35,863 --> 00:38:37,194
What do you mean?

513
00:38:37,765 --> 00:38:39,528
I could smell iodine.

514
00:38:40,434 --> 00:38:43,835
That's a very specific scent
that's unique largely...

515
00:38:44,038 --> 00:38:45,903
...to ambulances and hospitals.

516
00:38:46,941 --> 00:38:51,344
I could see that your hair had been wet,
but dried naturally.

517
00:38:51,879 --> 00:38:54,439
But I smelled iodine,
so you hadn't gone home...

518
00:38:54,648 --> 00:38:57,173
...to bathe or scrub down
since your last shift.

519
00:38:57,385 --> 00:39:01,219
Then I assumed you worked
the night before, when it rained.

520
00:39:01,956 --> 00:39:04,447
Then I figured paramedic,
not doctor or nurse.

521
00:39:04,725 --> 00:39:06,056
That's how...

522
00:39:07,228 --> 00:39:09,389
...I just kind of guessed.

523
00:39:11,132 --> 00:39:12,861
You're right about...

524
00:39:13,234 --> 00:39:14,565
...each part.

525
00:39:17,138 --> 00:39:19,129
Do you enjoy that work?

526
00:39:19,407 --> 00:39:20,897
Sometimes.

527
00:39:21,242 --> 00:39:22,641
Sometimes?

528
00:39:24,578 --> 00:39:26,045
It can be a thrill.

529
00:39:26,781 --> 00:39:30,945
You rush in the middle of something,
some chaotic mess, and get involved...

530
00:39:31,152 --> 00:39:32,585
...intervene...

531
00:39:33,154 --> 00:39:35,213
...maybe help somebody...

532
00:39:35,423 --> 00:39:36,754
...maybe revive their body.

533
00:39:37,758 --> 00:39:39,521
Some of it's just boring, though.

534
00:39:40,661 --> 00:39:42,424
The hours are terrible.

535
00:39:42,997 --> 00:39:46,797
12 and 18-hour shifts...
I'm rambling now, so...

536
00:39:50,271 --> 00:39:51,932
That's interesting to me.

537
00:39:55,276 --> 00:39:57,608
What about you?
Do you live around here?

538
00:39:57,945 --> 00:39:59,469
"Do you live around here?"

539
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:00,977
Stupid question.

540
00:40:01,182 --> 00:40:02,740
What difference does that make?

541
00:40:02,950 --> 00:40:04,611
No, that's okay.

542
00:40:05,986 --> 00:40:08,580
I'm only here for
a couple of days on business.

543
00:40:09,690 --> 00:40:11,419
So you're with that conference?

544
00:40:15,629 --> 00:40:17,187
So you're an accountant?

545
00:40:21,202 --> 00:40:23,534
That's pretty exciting, I know.

546
00:40:23,871 --> 00:40:28,308
I don't know how you do that.
All the forms, all the time...

547
00:40:29,310 --> 00:40:31,141
The forms grow on you.

548
00:40:33,047 --> 00:40:34,241
Where do you live?

549
00:40:35,649 --> 00:40:36,707
Nick.

550
00:40:37,485 --> 00:40:39,180
I know. Nick Carmine.

551
00:40:41,155 --> 00:40:43,487
Daisy, the front desk. She told me.

552
00:40:54,935 --> 00:40:57,335
What did I tell you
about these curtains?

553
00:40:57,538 --> 00:40:59,335
And these over here?

554
00:41:07,915 --> 00:41:09,712
Fucking whales?

555
00:41:11,285 --> 00:41:12,809
Fuck the whales!

556
00:41:16,891 --> 00:41:18,483
I'm a mess.

557
00:41:18,826 --> 00:41:20,885
All that fucking exercise.

558
00:41:21,729 --> 00:41:24,163
Maybe you should
stop snorting that shit.

559
00:41:24,365 --> 00:41:26,731
It keeps my teeth sharp.

560
00:41:27,501 --> 00:41:31,062
I went back to L.A. And got that stuff
that you sent me to get...

561
00:41:31,572 --> 00:41:34,700
...but since you then
went back to L.A. Yourself...

562
00:41:34,909 --> 00:41:36,877
...you probably don't need it anymore.

563
00:41:37,077 --> 00:41:41,741
Did you see that poem that Stark
wrote in college, "An Ode to Clarissa?"

564
00:41:42,082 --> 00:41:47,418
Worst I've read since the case of the
shrinking gypsy stripper's scribblings.

565
00:41:48,589 --> 00:41:49,647
Tell me this:

566
00:41:49,857 --> 00:41:52,758
How do you rhyme
'towards' and 'birds'?

567
00:41:53,394 --> 00:41:55,157
"Dropping, falling...

568
00:41:55,362 --> 00:41:57,990
...diving towards...

569
00:41:58,199 --> 00:42:00,099
Two lovers lost.

570
00:42:00,701 --> 00:42:01,759
Plummeting...

571
00:42:03,037 --> 00:42:05,198
...birds"?
They don't rhyme.

572
00:42:06,207 --> 00:42:08,004
Maybe it's not supposed to rhyme.

573
00:42:08,209 --> 00:42:09,369
Also...

574
00:42:09,910 --> 00:42:12,174
...how do you write a poem
about Clarissa...

575
00:42:12,379 --> 00:42:14,677
...and never have the name
in the poem?

576
00:42:14,882 --> 00:42:19,342
If ever a name deserved, begged
to be in a poem, it's Clarissa.

577
00:42:21,288 --> 00:42:26,191
Anyway, I did that phone book-database
cross-reference thing you asked for...

578
00:42:26,393 --> 00:42:29,021
...and there are 1800 men in Oregon...

579
00:42:29,230 --> 00:42:30,857
...with the initials 'K.V.'

580
00:42:31,065 --> 00:42:35,559
And about a million in the United States
that are listed.

581
00:42:37,404 --> 00:42:40,396
How about you?
Have any luck on your end?

582
00:42:43,244 --> 00:42:45,144
I found the blackmailer.

583
00:42:47,081 --> 00:42:48,776
- You did?
- Yeah.

584
00:42:49,250 --> 00:42:51,616
Her name is Gloria Sullivan.

585
00:42:51,819 --> 00:42:53,582
How do you know it's her?

586
00:42:53,988 --> 00:42:55,216
I watched her...

587
00:42:55,422 --> 00:42:56,946
...walk into the bathroom...

588
00:42:57,157 --> 00:42:58,715
...and get the money.

589
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:02,285
I have to admit I was a bit surprised.

590
00:43:02,496 --> 00:43:06,091
I had a few guesses about suspects,
but I'd never...

591
00:43:06,333 --> 00:43:09,461
I mean, I just didn't even
think twice about that girl.

592
00:43:09,670 --> 00:43:12,036
So what's her deal?

593
00:43:12,406 --> 00:43:13,805
Her deal?

594
00:43:14,208 --> 00:43:18,838
Her deal is that there is absolutely
nothing out of the ordinary about her.

595
00:43:20,414 --> 00:43:23,542
She's a model citizen,
college graduate, good paramedic.

596
00:43:23,751 --> 00:43:28,654
She volunteers at a hospital for the
elderly. She has no criminal record.

597
00:43:28,856 --> 00:43:31,586
I mean, she's very even-tempered.

598
00:43:32,426 --> 00:43:34,018
She's friendly...

599
00:43:34,361 --> 00:43:36,090
...eager to chat.

600
00:43:37,531 --> 00:43:41,763
There's no nervousness about her,
which is odd for a blackmailer.

601
00:43:42,936 --> 00:43:45,530
Even at the pickup yesterday,
she's just...

602
00:43:46,040 --> 00:43:48,270
She's very cool.

603
00:43:50,044 --> 00:43:51,773
She's very cool.

604
00:43:53,514 --> 00:43:56,039
But there's a definite
intensity about her.

605
00:43:56,250 --> 00:43:58,241
She looks you right in the eye.

606
00:43:58,452 --> 00:44:00,750
Sort of a sensual quality.

607
00:44:00,954 --> 00:44:02,785
Very personable.

608
00:44:03,624 --> 00:44:05,615
A nice sense of humor...

609
00:44:06,060 --> 00:44:08,221
...and actually very charming.

610
00:44:10,464 --> 00:44:11,795
Charming?

611
00:44:12,966 --> 00:44:14,900
Did you just say charming?

612
00:44:20,974 --> 00:44:23,738
Keep looking for that
safe deposit box...

613
00:44:24,244 --> 00:44:26,371
...and then get Stark out of the office.

614
00:44:26,580 --> 00:44:29,743
Make plans for him
to pay you at 5:00 tonight.

615
00:44:30,884 --> 00:44:33,944
Then maybe you could go home
for a couple of nights.

616
00:44:34,254 --> 00:44:35,744
Couple of nights?

617
00:44:36,256 --> 00:44:40,420
Aren't we done? You found
the blackmailer. He only wanted a name.

618
00:44:41,028 --> 00:44:42,689
We're not done yet.

619
00:44:43,097 --> 00:44:46,589
First I have to find out
what her deal is.

620
00:45:02,883 --> 00:45:04,077
Is this your kid?

621
00:45:04,284 --> 00:45:05,410
Nope.

622
00:45:05,619 --> 00:45:07,109
Just a rental.

623
00:45:07,721 --> 00:45:10,781
- You got the money?
- It's in the trunk. The first third.

624
00:45:16,230 --> 00:45:17,561
You want a turn?

625
00:45:19,800 --> 00:45:21,893
Does he know who's doing this to me?

626
00:45:22,136 --> 00:45:23,535
Can't tell you anything yet.

627
00:45:23,737 --> 00:45:24,704
Nothing.

628
00:45:24,905 --> 00:45:27,567
Too soon. Could interfere
with the investigation.

629
00:45:27,808 --> 00:45:29,105
Jesus.

630
00:45:29,309 --> 00:45:31,436
Okay, so here's how this is
going to work.

631
00:45:31,645 --> 00:45:34,113
You gave your car
to the valet like I asked?

632
00:45:34,314 --> 00:45:35,281
Good.

633
00:45:35,482 --> 00:45:37,382
Now when we get out of sight...

634
00:45:37,584 --> 00:45:41,953
...give me your valet ticket, I'll give
you one. Go back to the restaurant.

635
00:45:42,156 --> 00:45:43,214
Order something.

636
00:45:43,424 --> 00:45:45,892
I had a late lunch. I'm not hungry.

637
00:45:46,093 --> 00:45:48,721
Then order something light,
like a salad.

638
00:45:48,929 --> 00:45:51,056
When you're done,
give the valet your ticket.

639
00:45:51,265 --> 00:45:53,233
He'll bring a car identical to yours.

640
00:45:53,434 --> 00:45:55,299
Follow the map in the glove box.

641
00:45:55,502 --> 00:46:00,405
It'll lead you back to your own car,
which I'll have taken our money out of.

642
00:46:00,607 --> 00:46:02,268
Keys'll be in the visor.

643
00:46:02,776 --> 00:46:05,836
Now is there anything
you want to tell Mr. Zero...

644
00:46:06,079 --> 00:46:07,808
...that might make his job easier?

645
00:46:08,782 --> 00:46:10,340
What do you have in mind?

646
00:46:11,385 --> 00:46:13,148
Like for example...

647
00:46:13,687 --> 00:46:16,349
...what's in the safe deposit box
and where is it?

648
00:46:17,057 --> 00:46:18,615
I told you...

649
00:46:18,959 --> 00:46:21,393
...that is not pertinent to his task.

650
00:46:35,375 --> 00:46:36,637
"K.V."

651
00:46:39,313 --> 00:46:41,873
<i>Now, a few words on looking for things.</i>

652
00:46:42,616 --> 00:46:44,948
<i>When you look for something specific...</i>

653
00:46:45,152 --> 00:46:48,178
<i>... your chances of finding it
are very bad...</i>

654
00:46:48,388 --> 00:46:51,846
<i>... because of all things in the world,
you only want one of them.</i>

655
00:46:53,060 --> 00:46:55,426
<i>When you look for anything at all...</i>

656
00:46:55,629 --> 00:46:58,655
<i>... your chances of finding it
are very good...</i>

657
00:46:58,899 --> 00:47:00,730
<i>... because of all the
things in the world...</i>

658
00:47:00,968 --> 00:47:03,334
<i>... you're sure to find some of them.</i>

659
00:47:03,904 --> 00:47:05,371
<i>And the most important rule:</i>

660
00:47:05,572 --> 00:47:07,540
<i>Often what you're looking for...</i>

661
00:47:07,741 --> 00:47:09,732
<i>... is right in front of your nose.</i>

662
00:47:17,918 --> 00:47:19,249
There he is.

663
00:47:21,188 --> 00:47:23,816
I told you about his thing
for redheads, right?

664
00:47:24,024 --> 00:47:27,357
Guess what color hair his secretary has.

665
00:47:28,929 --> 00:47:30,021
Red?

666
00:47:32,366 --> 00:47:34,596
Men are so predictable.

667
00:47:36,036 --> 00:47:38,027
So did you find anything useful?

668
00:47:38,372 --> 00:47:39,703
Gold mine.

669
00:47:41,542 --> 00:47:46,445
First of all, I got a full name on that
boxer that Clearburg couldn't find.

670
00:47:46,780 --> 00:47:48,748
Kragen Vincent.

671
00:47:48,949 --> 00:47:50,382
K.V.

672
00:47:50,684 --> 00:47:52,675
It was on a letter
from our blackmailer...

673
00:47:52,953 --> 00:47:57,413
...to our blackmailee. "I warn you:
Stay away from Kragen Vincent."

674
00:47:57,624 --> 00:47:59,956
He said he gave us all the letters.

675
00:48:00,394 --> 00:48:02,089
He didn't give us that one.

676
00:48:02,296 --> 00:48:06,027
Mr. Stark apparently doesn't want me
to know about Kragen Vincent.

677
00:48:06,233 --> 00:48:09,225
So we'll have to figure out
who he is and where.

678
00:48:11,638 --> 00:48:14,630
I did find one other thing
of interest, though.

679
00:48:17,744 --> 00:48:21,771
Holy shit! Those are the keys.
You found the gold Swiss Army knife.

680
00:48:22,015 --> 00:48:22,777
I know.

681
00:48:23,083 --> 00:48:25,608
And the safe deposit box key.
Where'd you find them?

682
00:48:26,153 --> 00:48:28,053
In the sofa under the cushion.

683
00:48:28,255 --> 00:48:29,222
What?

684
00:48:29,423 --> 00:48:31,288
They were stuck in the couch...

685
00:48:31,491 --> 00:48:32,651
...in his office.

686
00:48:33,260 --> 00:48:35,387
Was he hiding them? Is that possible?

687
00:48:35,596 --> 00:48:37,427
No. Not possible.

688
00:48:37,931 --> 00:48:40,991
That's where they fell out
of his pocket over a year ago.

689
00:48:43,437 --> 00:48:44,802
What do you make of this?

690
00:48:45,005 --> 00:48:49,169
I think, just as I feared, Ms. Sullivan
doesn't know a thing about these keys.

691
00:48:50,444 --> 00:48:52,708
The keys are a coincidence?

692
00:48:57,851 --> 00:48:59,944
That's confusing.

693
00:49:04,691 --> 00:49:06,249
Doesn't seem like a...

694
00:49:06,460 --> 00:49:07,950
...good thing.

695
00:49:09,029 --> 00:49:10,326
Sure it is.

696
00:49:10,530 --> 00:49:15,297
It's good because the man has been
looking for his keys for a year...

697
00:49:15,636 --> 00:49:17,866
...and I found them.

698
00:49:21,541 --> 00:49:23,702
Now, I'm going to go home.

699
00:49:24,044 --> 00:49:28,037
So tell me you won't need me tomorrow
because I could check out this Kragen...

700
00:49:28,248 --> 00:49:29,977
I won't need you tomorrow.

701
00:49:31,218 --> 00:49:33,152
I'm trusting you here, Daryl.

702
00:49:33,654 --> 00:49:35,212
Have a nice trip.

703
00:49:45,232 --> 00:49:47,792
<i>It's cold and dark...</i>

704
00:49:48,001 --> 00:49:49,901
...in my heart

705
00:49:53,740 --> 00:49:58,234
Said it's cold and dark in my heart...

706
00:50:00,347 --> 00:50:01,314
...Mama

707
00:50:10,357 --> 00:50:13,849
Look, I know this is totally
inappropriate but...

708
00:50:14,594 --> 00:50:16,585
- Never mind.
- What?

709
00:50:17,531 --> 00:50:19,692
You know what I'm going
to ask you.

710
00:50:27,774 --> 00:50:30,766
Is there any way I can get you to
look over my tax returns?

711
00:50:42,556 --> 00:50:45,252
You can speak 6 languages
and fly a jetliner...

712
00:50:45,459 --> 00:50:48,223
...but you don't know
how to file a tax return?

713
00:50:49,563 --> 00:50:51,224
It's never come up?

714
00:50:51,798 --> 00:50:53,959
Does this have to happen right now?

715
00:50:58,071 --> 00:51:01,472
No, that's a W-2.
WW II was the Second World War.

716
00:51:06,146 --> 00:51:07,443
Here it is.

717
00:51:12,919 --> 00:51:14,716
My humble...

718
00:51:15,285 --> 00:51:16,513
...palace.

719
00:51:16,954 --> 00:51:18,512
It's very nice.

720
00:51:25,028 --> 00:51:26,996
How long have you been here?

721
00:51:27,197 --> 00:51:28,528
3 years.

722
00:51:29,867 --> 00:51:31,198
That's something.

723
00:51:35,806 --> 00:51:38,036
You're going to need a calculator?

724
00:51:41,979 --> 00:51:44,140
That would be great.

725
00:51:47,317 --> 00:51:48,978
You're an accountant...

726
00:51:50,387 --> 00:51:52,048
...so you would know.

727
00:51:54,992 --> 00:51:58,018
What is the Corrodium 3 deduction?

728
00:51:59,730 --> 00:52:01,698
The Corrodium 3 deduction.

729
00:52:01,899 --> 00:52:04,834
That's a very good question because...

730
00:52:05,402 --> 00:52:10,135
...that, in fact, is probably
the most widely misunderstood...

731
00:52:10,340 --> 00:52:12,001
...deduction in the book.

732
00:52:13,677 --> 00:52:14,735
Really.

733
00:52:16,346 --> 00:52:17,677
Indeed.

734
00:52:18,749 --> 00:52:21,217
The Corrodium 3 deduction...

735
00:52:21,418 --> 00:52:24,114
...is an incentive used by
large manufacturers...

736
00:52:24,321 --> 00:52:29,850
...who are able to moderate their use
of Class 3 decay toxins such as...

737
00:52:30,194 --> 00:52:32,094
...Corrodium and...

738
00:52:36,934 --> 00:52:38,526
...Maalgorium.

739
00:52:40,871 --> 00:52:42,270
Anything else?

740
00:52:45,709 --> 00:52:46,835
All right.

741
00:52:47,044 --> 00:52:48,602
Time to get dirty.

742
00:52:49,947 --> 00:52:52,939
About how long is this going to take?

743
00:52:55,118 --> 00:52:57,211
A little while.

744
00:52:57,955 --> 00:53:02,119
If you don't mind, I was
going to take a nap.

745
00:53:08,465 --> 00:53:10,262
Are you sure it's okay?

746
00:53:10,467 --> 00:53:11,900
I'll just...

747
00:53:12,169 --> 00:53:13,136
...be here.

748
00:53:14,638 --> 00:53:17,232
Just yell if you need anything else.

749
00:53:53,110 --> 00:53:54,805
How's it going over there?

750
00:53:55,012 --> 00:53:56,809
Just another minute.

751
00:53:57,014 --> 00:53:58,845
I'm rechecking my math.

752
00:54:03,854 --> 00:54:05,981
You really ought to try...

753
00:54:06,189 --> 00:54:07,816
...to keep all your receipts...

754
00:54:08,025 --> 00:54:09,617
...for everything.

755
00:54:10,961 --> 00:54:12,792
I know. I never remember.

756
00:54:19,536 --> 00:54:21,163
Just put them in an envelope.

757
00:54:21,371 --> 00:54:24,636
That's the thing to do.
I try to keep all my receipts.

758
00:54:25,142 --> 00:54:27,372
It's just a matter of habit now.

759
00:54:30,380 --> 00:54:32,644
I can't thank you enough.

760
00:54:33,317 --> 00:54:35,376
You really helped me out there.

761
00:54:36,386 --> 00:54:37,546
That's...

762
00:54:37,888 --> 00:54:39,651
...really my pleasure.

763
00:54:43,327 --> 00:54:44,726
Okay, listen.

764
00:54:45,896 --> 00:54:47,386
Let me make you dinner.

765
00:54:51,001 --> 00:54:54,061
No, you don't have to do that.

766
00:54:54,938 --> 00:54:56,200
I insist.

767
00:54:56,406 --> 00:54:59,569
I'll hop in the shower real quick,
then make us some food.

768
00:55:02,245 --> 00:55:03,405
All right.

769
00:57:15,812 --> 00:57:16,938
"Retired."

770
00:57:17,147 --> 00:57:18,205
Jesus!

771
00:57:18,415 --> 00:57:19,575
Another 7-letter word.

772
00:57:19,783 --> 00:57:21,444
17 plus 50...

773
00:57:21,651 --> 00:57:23,050
...67 points.

774
00:57:25,722 --> 00:57:27,053
Retire.

775
00:57:30,827 --> 00:57:32,055
Retire.

776
00:57:34,164 --> 00:57:35,859
It's not quite that simple.

777
00:57:36,399 --> 00:57:38,833
Why is it not that simple, Steve?

778
00:57:39,503 --> 00:57:41,300
Whenever you say that...

779
00:57:41,505 --> 00:57:42,665
...it creeps me out.

780
00:57:43,740 --> 00:57:46,504
I told you, it's nothing weird.

781
00:57:47,677 --> 00:57:51,738
I mean, okay, yes. It's a little weird.
But it's nothing creepy...

782
00:57:53,517 --> 00:57:54,916
...exactly.

783
00:57:55,852 --> 00:57:57,717
What do you get out of this?

784
00:57:57,921 --> 00:58:01,322
What kind of a hold does this guy,
whoever he is...

785
00:58:01,525 --> 00:58:02,753
...have on you?

786
00:58:05,362 --> 00:58:06,852
He needs me.

787
00:58:12,269 --> 00:58:13,702
He needs you.

788
00:58:17,374 --> 00:58:18,864
Who needs who?

789
00:58:26,716 --> 00:58:28,047
I need you.

790
00:58:31,721 --> 00:58:34,121
It's time to get away from him, Steve.

791
00:58:49,806 --> 00:58:51,967
I'll do it tomorrow when I get there...

792
00:58:53,977 --> 00:58:55,035
...if...

793
00:58:55,245 --> 00:58:57,270
...you will marry me.

794
00:59:07,591 --> 00:59:08,819
Marry me.

795
00:59:16,333 --> 00:59:17,960
<i>Absolutely vital:</i>

796
00:59:18,168 --> 00:59:20,602
<i>The ability to blend in.</i>

797
00:59:21,171 --> 00:59:24,265
<i>To very discreetly assimilate.</i>

798
00:59:24,608 --> 00:59:26,473
<i>It's not usually very difficult.</i>

799
00:59:26,676 --> 00:59:29,076
<i>All you have to do is look around...</i>

800
00:59:29,279 --> 00:59:31,747
<i>... see how all the ordinary people
are behaving...</i>

801
00:59:31,948 --> 00:59:34,178
<i>... and try to behave like one of them.</i>

802
00:59:39,856 --> 00:59:42,017
You know, when I was in L. A...

803
00:59:42,459 --> 00:59:45,121
...it seemed like such a lonely town.

804
00:59:46,630 --> 00:59:50,999
Everybody's driving in their cars,
nobody talks to each other...

805
00:59:55,305 --> 00:59:58,297
I don't really know,
to tell you the truth...

806
00:59:58,875 --> 01:00:00,308
...about that.

807
01:00:02,045 --> 01:00:03,808
So where are you from?

808
01:00:04,047 --> 01:00:05,378
Originally?

809
01:00:07,717 --> 01:00:09,048
Minnesota.

810
01:00:10,487 --> 01:00:11,886
Minnesota.

811
01:00:13,890 --> 01:00:15,619
I've never been there.

812
01:00:15,825 --> 01:00:17,725
Do you go back there much?

813
01:00:24,334 --> 01:00:26,325
You still have family there?

814
01:00:32,075 --> 01:00:34,066
We're not really in touch.

815
01:00:37,013 --> 01:00:38,173
So...

816
01:00:39,082 --> 01:00:41,676
...what are you doing in L.A.?

817
01:00:45,021 --> 01:00:47,581
Oh, I was there twice.

818
01:00:50,760 --> 01:00:53,092
Once when I was little.

819
01:00:54,097 --> 01:00:56,531
I was there with my aunt and uncle.

820
01:00:57,033 --> 01:01:00,366
I was raised by my aunt and uncle.
They adopted me.

821
01:01:03,440 --> 01:01:06,432
Then last year I was there skydiving.

822
01:01:07,377 --> 01:01:08,776
Skydiving?

823
01:01:13,717 --> 01:01:15,184
Why do you do that?

824
01:01:16,052 --> 01:01:17,781
Because I love it.

825
01:01:19,122 --> 01:01:21,556
It's the most amazing
thing in the world.

826
01:01:22,759 --> 01:01:25,227
Aren't you afraid you'll die
or something?

827
01:01:28,064 --> 01:01:29,895
I know what you need.

828
01:01:37,741 --> 01:01:38,901
Try again.

829
01:01:40,010 --> 01:01:42,672
Take your time now.
Really set yourself.

830
01:01:43,747 --> 01:01:46,011
Remember to bend your elbows a little.

831
01:01:47,183 --> 01:01:48,480
A little less.

832
01:01:48,685 --> 01:01:51,017
Keep the right arm straight
with the left elbow.

833
01:01:51,688 --> 01:01:53,349
Check your aim again.

834
01:01:53,857 --> 01:01:55,586
Then whenever you're ready.

835
01:02:22,118 --> 01:02:24,052
You do this all the time?

836
01:02:24,287 --> 01:02:26,050
Whenever I can.

837
01:02:26,623 --> 01:02:29,456
I find it deeply satisfying.

838
01:02:36,299 --> 01:02:37,493
Nice.

839
01:02:38,735 --> 01:02:40,066
You try again.

840
01:02:46,209 --> 01:02:47,574
Take your time.

841
01:02:48,545 --> 01:02:50,069
Don't be afraid. It's safe...

842
01:02:50,280 --> 01:02:52,908
...just as long as you're careful.
It's all about...

843
01:02:53,216 --> 01:02:54,274
...staying relaxed.

844
01:02:56,052 --> 01:02:57,144
Sorry.

845
01:02:58,488 --> 01:02:59,648
It's okay.

846
01:03:02,659 --> 01:03:04,149
Just relax.

847
01:03:07,163 --> 01:03:08,721
Bend this a little.

848
01:03:08,932 --> 01:03:10,593
Keep this straight.

849
01:03:12,168 --> 01:03:13,499
Hips back a little.

850
01:03:14,170 --> 01:03:15,660
Lean into it.

851
01:03:17,607 --> 01:03:19,006
Commit to it.

852
01:03:22,779 --> 01:03:24,337
Check your aim again.

853
01:03:26,783 --> 01:03:28,011
Relax...

854
01:03:29,119 --> 01:03:30,450
...and fire.

855
01:03:36,526 --> 01:03:37,788
There you go.

856
01:03:39,028 --> 01:03:40,518
Doesn't that feel good?

857
01:03:48,471 --> 01:03:50,701
- Want to try the shotgun?
- Sure.

858
01:04:07,557 --> 01:04:09,991
You want to stay at my place tonight?

859
01:04:12,395 --> 01:04:15,922
I mean, you don't have to.
But the couch folds out.

860
01:04:17,901 --> 01:04:20,369
I just thought it'd be silly
to go to my place...

861
01:04:20,637 --> 01:04:24,733
...then you'd have to drive across town
to some crummy old motel.

862
01:04:32,415 --> 01:04:34,042
That'd be great.

863
01:04:34,250 --> 01:04:35,342
Good.

864
01:04:36,686 --> 01:04:40,520
I'll even give you a receipt.
You can write it off.

865
01:04:41,558 --> 01:04:43,287
You know my motto:

866
01:04:45,361 --> 01:04:47,420
Always save the receipt.

867
01:05:00,710 --> 01:05:02,109
You slept at her house?

868
01:05:03,613 --> 01:05:05,410
She thought it'd be easier...

869
01:05:05,648 --> 01:05:07,741
...than driving back to the motel.

870
01:05:07,951 --> 01:05:10,078
I can't believe you slept at her house.

871
01:05:10,286 --> 01:05:12,584
I can't believe,
with all that time with her...

872
01:05:12,789 --> 01:05:15,724
...I couldn't tell more
what was going on in her head.

873
01:05:16,059 --> 01:05:18,289
I couldn't tell what she
was thinking.

874
01:05:19,229 --> 01:05:22,130
That's usually how it is
in the beginning.

875
01:05:24,300 --> 01:05:27,565
Maybe I'll be able to see more
tonight at dinner.

876
01:05:29,138 --> 01:05:30,799
You're taking her to dinner.

877
01:05:31,140 --> 01:05:33,074
What was I going to say, no?

878
01:05:33,409 --> 01:05:35,377
You got anymore on Kragen Vincent?

879
01:05:35,578 --> 01:05:38,706
There's one serving time
at the State Penitentiary.

880
01:05:38,915 --> 01:05:42,112
A life sentence.
Prison records didn't say what for.

881
01:05:42,318 --> 01:05:45,151
We better go find out. Anything else?

882
01:05:46,589 --> 01:05:47,749
What is it?

883
01:05:48,591 --> 01:05:49,649
Nothing.

884
01:06:10,913 --> 01:06:12,972
You the officer in charge of records?

885
01:06:13,182 --> 01:06:15,241
I'm him. Lieutenant Earl Hagans.

886
01:06:15,551 --> 01:06:18,645
- Steve Arlo. Can I come in?
- What is this regarding?

887
01:06:18,855 --> 01:06:20,152
I work for a private...

888
01:06:20,390 --> 01:06:24,486
The Department does not share records
with P.I. S except by court order.

889
01:06:24,727 --> 01:06:27,491
I assume that you do not have
a court order.

890
01:06:27,697 --> 01:06:29,995
I work for a private detective
named Daryl Zero.

891
01:06:33,970 --> 01:06:36,939
Murder One, in 1972. Single count.

892
01:06:37,573 --> 01:06:39,700
And guess what the victim's name is.

893
01:06:39,909 --> 01:06:40,933
Let me guess.

894
01:06:41,144 --> 01:06:44,443
I don't mean really guess.
No way you could actually guess.

895
01:06:44,647 --> 01:06:46,080
Clarissa.

896
01:06:47,650 --> 01:06:49,743
Yeah. Clarissa Devereau.

897
01:06:50,586 --> 01:06:52,053
Of 'plummeting birds' fame.

898
01:06:52,255 --> 01:06:53,517
Seems likely, doesn't it?

899
01:06:53,756 --> 01:06:54,882
Very likely.

900
01:06:54,924 --> 01:06:58,553
Two shots, one to the head,
one to the torso, execution style.

901
01:06:58,795 --> 01:07:00,126
In her motel room.

902
01:07:00,330 --> 01:07:01,797
Sounds professional.

903
01:07:01,998 --> 01:07:06,401
Except he made a complete mess.
A ton of evidence, prints on everything.

904
01:07:07,670 --> 01:07:09,467
I got crime scene photos.

905
01:07:09,672 --> 01:07:13,631
Remember the case of the hired gun
who made way, way too many mistakes?

906
01:07:14,010 --> 01:07:18,413
It's a lot like that. They pick him up,
try him, give him life, no parole.

907
01:07:18,614 --> 01:07:20,809
They think he works for someone
but he won't talk...

908
01:07:21,050 --> 01:07:22,881
...even when they offer him a deal.

909
01:07:23,086 --> 01:07:26,146
And Clarissa has quite
an arrest record for a young girl.

910
01:07:26,522 --> 01:07:28,581
Mostly political, New York and Boston.

911
01:07:28,791 --> 01:07:32,090
Disturbing the peace,
public indecency...

912
01:07:32,295 --> 01:07:33,728
...breaking and entering.

913
01:07:33,963 --> 01:07:35,260
Regular firecracker.

914
01:07:35,465 --> 01:07:37,524
Regular 'plummeting bird.'

915
01:07:39,535 --> 01:07:41,230
And Vincent's still in jail?

916
01:07:41,704 --> 01:07:45,640
No. He was moved for medical reasons
a couple years ago.

917
01:08:08,731 --> 01:08:10,323
<i>Kragen is her father.</i>

918
01:08:11,334 --> 01:08:14,565
She was raised by his sister
because he was in prison.

919
01:08:15,171 --> 01:08:18,334
She blames Stark
for ruining her father's life.

920
01:08:18,775 --> 01:08:22,040
Stark hired Vincent to kill Clarissa...

921
01:08:22,412 --> 01:08:24,039
...for some reason.

922
01:08:24,247 --> 01:08:28,149
Vincent got caught, spent his life
in prison. Now he's dying...

923
01:08:28,351 --> 01:08:30,751
...this slow, painful death.

924
01:08:31,187 --> 01:08:35,590
She's watched her father's life
drip away and she's getting even.

925
01:08:36,025 --> 01:08:38,721
She has something,
some evidence or something...

926
01:08:38,928 --> 01:08:41,362
...that ties Stark to the murder.

927
01:08:41,931 --> 01:08:45,867
I got to figure out what it is
and where she's keeping it.

928
01:08:48,037 --> 01:08:51,200
Take me to the scene of the crime.

929
01:08:54,544 --> 01:08:56,412
It's right up here.

930
01:08:57,046 --> 01:08:59,446
<i>Ready? 1, 2, 3.</i>

931
01:09:03,386 --> 01:09:06,082
The bed we just moved
is a full-size bed.

932
01:09:06,289 --> 01:09:09,417
In 1972, there was no size
called full.

933
01:09:09,625 --> 01:09:11,525
They had doubles and queens.

934
01:09:11,727 --> 01:09:15,094
The full was invented
to combine the width of a queen...

935
01:09:15,298 --> 01:09:18,096
...with the space-efficient
length of a double...

936
01:09:18,301 --> 01:09:21,566
...and eventually replaced the double
in North America and Europe...

937
01:09:21,771 --> 01:09:24,365
...except for Quebec and Sweden.

938
01:09:24,574 --> 01:09:26,974
The bed in the picture...

939
01:09:27,643 --> 01:09:29,133
...is not a double.

940
01:09:29,479 --> 01:09:32,539
It's too long. It's not a full.
It wasn't invented.

941
01:09:32,748 --> 01:09:34,841
It is a queen.

942
01:09:38,087 --> 01:09:42,217
Which means that that bed then
was longer than this bed...

943
01:09:42,425 --> 01:09:43,653
...now.

944
01:09:45,528 --> 01:09:48,986
So sometime in the last 30 years,
somebody must have replaced the bed.

945
01:09:52,602 --> 01:09:53,466
Hear that?

946
01:09:54,604 --> 01:09:55,764
Secret room?

947
01:09:56,672 --> 01:10:00,608
It's a pipe. There once was a radiant
water heater right there.

948
01:10:02,778 --> 01:10:04,473
Kragen bursts into the room.

949
01:10:04,680 --> 01:10:08,912
Her body was found face up. She must've
been facing him, probably standing...

950
01:10:09,118 --> 01:10:11,586
...close to where you are now.

951
01:10:11,787 --> 01:10:14,813
Right away, before she could scream,
she's down...

952
01:10:15,024 --> 01:10:17,185
...she's dead, it's over.

953
01:10:17,793 --> 01:10:20,694
The only question is,
once she was dead...

954
01:10:21,697 --> 01:10:23,790
...why didn't he get out of there?

955
01:10:24,700 --> 01:10:28,261
Instead he proceeds
to touch the dresser, the sink...

956
01:10:28,471 --> 01:10:31,304
...the doorknob and the nightstand.

957
01:10:33,476 --> 01:10:35,706
What does the bed have to do with it?

958
01:10:36,712 --> 01:10:39,510
In 1972, it was against code...

959
01:10:39,715 --> 01:10:43,014
...to have a hotel bed
2 feet from a door that opens inwards...

960
01:10:43,219 --> 01:10:45,210
...7 feet from a fish tank...

961
01:10:45,421 --> 01:10:46,888
...or a lava lamp...

962
01:10:47,156 --> 01:10:50,284
...or 3 feet from a radiant...

963
01:10:50,426 --> 01:10:51,586
...heater.

964
01:10:52,395 --> 01:10:55,956
Imagine if you will,
a bed longer than this one...

965
01:10:56,165 --> 01:10:58,258
...and a heater over here.

966
01:10:58,701 --> 01:10:59,827
Wouldn't clear 2 feet...

967
01:11:00,036 --> 01:11:03,494
...much less 3. And no inspector
would let that pass.

968
01:11:04,440 --> 01:11:05,634
Which means...?

969
01:11:06,108 --> 01:11:07,666
Which means...

970
01:11:10,947 --> 01:11:12,972
...lKragen may have moved the bed.

971
01:11:13,849 --> 01:11:16,147
I see. So you're proposing...

972
01:11:16,419 --> 01:11:18,216
...that he busts in the room...

973
01:11:18,421 --> 01:11:20,946
...sees her standing there,
shoots her twice...

974
01:11:22,124 --> 01:11:23,421
...moves the bed.

975
01:11:23,626 --> 01:11:24,923
Something like that.

976
01:11:25,127 --> 01:11:26,992
Why would anybody do that?

977
01:11:27,229 --> 01:11:29,424
Hello.
I don't know.

978
01:11:29,632 --> 01:11:34,092
I'm trying to figure out some physical
evidence that Kragen might have taken...

979
01:11:34,303 --> 01:11:38,034
...that he gave to his daughter
so that she could blackmail Stark.

980
01:11:38,274 --> 01:11:41,402
I'm trying to figure out what is absent.

981
01:11:42,712 --> 01:11:46,614
Something happened in here. Something
involving his touching the dresser...

982
01:11:46,816 --> 01:11:51,719
...touching the sink, touching the
doorknob, touching the nightstand...

983
01:11:52,989 --> 01:11:54,183
...and probably...

984
01:11:54,390 --> 01:11:55,857
...moving the bed.

985
01:11:56,726 --> 01:11:57,988
Probably?

986
01:11:59,161 --> 01:12:01,129
Somebody else could have moved it.

987
01:12:01,330 --> 01:12:04,231
Come on. There were only
two of them. Him and her.

988
01:12:09,872 --> 01:12:10,702
Exactly.

989
01:12:14,176 --> 01:12:16,076
You need to talk to Stark.

990
01:12:17,246 --> 01:12:19,578
We got a few questions for him.

991
01:12:20,916 --> 01:12:23,544
I had a feeling you two
would be a good match.

992
01:12:23,753 --> 01:12:25,846
I'm good at reading people.

993
01:12:27,923 --> 01:12:29,185
Thank you.

994
01:12:30,426 --> 01:12:32,018
Do you want my opinion?

995
01:12:33,362 --> 01:12:35,057
You should try to hold onto him.

996
01:12:35,264 --> 01:12:39,064
How often do you meet a wealthy single
architect from Los Angeles?

997
01:12:39,869 --> 01:12:42,429
Daisy, he's an accountant.

998
01:12:43,105 --> 01:12:44,436
Are you sure?

999
01:12:45,107 --> 01:12:49,942
He's here for their convention.
That's why I asked him to do my taxes.

1000
01:12:50,212 --> 01:12:52,544
I swear I thought he said
he was an architect.

1001
01:13:09,565 --> 01:13:10,725
Question:

1002
01:13:11,400 --> 01:13:12,867
- Sorry to startle you.
- Jesus.

1003
01:13:13,135 --> 01:13:16,730
How do you pronounce
the word t-o-w-a-r-d-s?

1004
01:13:17,139 --> 01:13:18,868
You nearly gave me a heart attack.

1005
01:13:19,075 --> 01:13:21,134
I had to contact you right away.

1006
01:13:21,644 --> 01:13:22,975
What do you need?

1007
01:13:23,312 --> 01:13:25,746
I must ask you some things.
Just drive.

1008
01:13:25,981 --> 01:13:27,642
Fasten your seat belt.

1009
01:13:29,151 --> 01:13:32,484
First of all, how do you pronounce
the word t-o-w-a-r-d-s?

1010
01:13:33,823 --> 01:13:35,017
Towards?

1011
01:13:35,257 --> 01:13:37,817
And things that have wings and fly?

1012
01:13:38,961 --> 01:13:40,155
You mean birds?

1013
01:13:40,830 --> 01:13:42,559
That's right. They don't rhyme.

1014
01:13:42,765 --> 01:13:43,823
What!?

1015
01:13:44,033 --> 01:13:45,295
Never mind.

1016
01:13:45,501 --> 01:13:47,833
The other thing was,
why did you kill Clarissa?

1017
01:13:50,773 --> 01:13:53,833
I met her my sophomore year.
I was 19...

1018
01:13:54,343 --> 01:13:57,278
...and she was 25, I think.

1019
01:13:57,680 --> 01:14:00,012
From New York, living in Cambridge.

1020
01:14:00,516 --> 01:14:02,609
I met her at a demonstration.

1021
01:14:03,119 --> 01:14:05,781
I have never seen anybody like her.

1022
01:14:06,455 --> 01:14:10,755
She let me walk her home and she
kissed me for the first and only time.

1023
01:14:10,960 --> 01:14:14,794
You can skip right to the part
where you decide to kill her.

1024
01:14:16,699 --> 01:14:18,360
Watch yourself, Arlo.

1025
01:14:19,869 --> 01:14:24,806
Please describe the circumstances
surrounding your contracting her murder.

1026
01:14:30,146 --> 01:14:32,876
After that first night, I was hooked.

1027
01:14:34,550 --> 01:14:36,381
I was like an addict.

1028
01:14:37,720 --> 01:14:40,382
Finally, she didn't want
to see me anymore.

1029
01:14:41,390 --> 01:14:43,483
I guess I got a little obsessive.

1030
01:14:47,062 --> 01:14:50,498
My last year of graduate school
I met my wife.

1031
01:14:51,333 --> 01:14:55,497
And after I graduated, we moved
back here, we got married...

1032
01:14:56,005 --> 01:14:58,906
...and I went to work
with my dad at the company.

1033
01:15:02,578 --> 01:15:05,240
And I had all but forgotten about...

1034
01:15:05,581 --> 01:15:06,912
...Clarissa.

1035
01:15:09,852 --> 01:15:13,015
Then, in 1972,
we'd been back about a year...

1036
01:15:15,591 --> 01:15:17,684
...I got a letter from her.

1037
01:15:19,094 --> 01:15:21,358
She was here in Portland.

1038
01:15:23,432 --> 01:15:24,990
The letter was...

1039
01:15:25,201 --> 01:15:27,431
...a threatening letter.

1040
01:15:29,104 --> 01:15:30,366
What was it?

1041
01:15:32,374 --> 01:15:35,207
I don't think that makes
a thread of difference.

1042
01:15:37,379 --> 01:15:39,609
What did the letter say?

1043
01:15:44,453 --> 01:15:47,115
She was accusing me of something.

1044
01:15:54,063 --> 01:15:55,155
Rape.

1045
01:15:58,234 --> 01:15:59,792
Did she want money?

1046
01:16:00,736 --> 01:16:03,102
No, she wanted to ruin my life.

1047
01:16:03,906 --> 01:16:07,273
I knew no jury'd convict me.
I was convinced of that.

1048
01:16:07,476 --> 01:16:11,105
But I couldn't take this
kind of publicity, nor could my family.

1049
01:16:11,313 --> 01:16:12,610
I saw...

1050
01:16:12,815 --> 01:16:15,579
...my whole future flash before my eyes.

1051
01:16:17,987 --> 01:16:19,955
So you hired Kragen Vincent.

1052
01:16:20,990 --> 01:16:23,652
He said that for $5,000...

1053
01:16:24,093 --> 01:16:26,084
...he could solve my problem.

1054
01:16:30,432 --> 01:16:33,265
And that's all I know
about the subject, officer.

1055
01:16:37,273 --> 01:16:40,106
So what's in the safe deposit box?

1056
01:16:43,178 --> 01:16:44,304
A tape.

1057
01:16:44,513 --> 01:16:47,573
A tape he made of our meeting.
Audio tape.

1058
01:16:47,750 --> 01:16:49,149
My hiring him...

1059
01:16:49,818 --> 01:16:52,412
...our names as clear as day.

1060
01:16:52,755 --> 01:16:54,882
Why didn't you just destroy it...

1061
01:16:55,124 --> 01:16:56,318
...years ago?

1062
01:16:57,092 --> 01:16:59,151
Because I don't know where it is.

1063
01:16:59,762 --> 01:17:00,922
Go on.

1064
01:17:02,097 --> 01:17:04,622
About a week after he gets caught...

1065
01:17:04,833 --> 01:17:07,961
...a man comes to my house
in the middle of the night...

1066
01:17:08,170 --> 01:17:12,607
...and tells me that Kragen expects me
to bankroll his defense...

1067
01:17:13,342 --> 01:17:15,333
...though a middleman, obviously.

1068
01:17:16,111 --> 01:17:17,578
And he also...

1069
01:17:17,780 --> 01:17:19,941
...wanted money for his family.

1070
01:17:21,116 --> 01:17:23,516
Then he played me a copy of this tape...

1071
01:17:24,520 --> 01:17:28,513
...and said if I refused he would
turn the tape over to the police.

1072
01:17:29,291 --> 01:17:30,781
He then gave me...

1073
01:17:31,293 --> 01:17:32,419
...a key to...

1074
01:17:32,628 --> 01:17:34,528
...a safe deposit box.

1075
01:17:34,863 --> 01:17:37,423
Said at the end of 25 years...

1076
01:17:37,633 --> 01:17:40,534
...when Kragen got out
or if he should die...

1077
01:17:40,869 --> 01:17:43,633
...I would be given
the location of the box.

1078
01:17:44,206 --> 01:17:45,969
In the meantime...

1079
01:17:46,809 --> 01:17:48,868
...l'm to hang onto this key...

1080
01:17:49,144 --> 01:17:53,706
...with no lock and our friend
would hang onto his lock with no key.

1081
01:17:55,651 --> 01:17:59,246
What would you do if someone was
threatening you like that...

1082
01:17:59,488 --> 01:18:02,423
...or blackmailing you like this?
What do you do?

1083
01:18:03,559 --> 01:18:04,685
I don't know.

1084
01:18:04,893 --> 01:18:06,554
It's never come up.

1085
01:18:07,496 --> 01:18:09,123
Imagine it.

1086
01:18:09,331 --> 01:18:10,821
Imagine some...

1087
01:18:11,066 --> 01:18:12,465
...opportunistic...

1088
01:18:12,668 --> 01:18:14,636
...piece of birdshit...

1089
01:18:14,837 --> 01:18:17,169
...has got a way to compromise you.

1090
01:18:18,073 --> 01:18:22,305
What do you do about it? You can't
buy silence. You can only rent it.

1091
01:18:22,511 --> 01:18:25,742
If somebody has something on you,
they'll always have it.

1092
01:18:26,081 --> 01:18:28,174
So the cost has no ceiling...

1093
01:18:30,252 --> 01:18:32,186
...and the fear has no end.

1094
01:18:35,591 --> 01:18:36,751
That's why...

1095
01:18:37,359 --> 01:18:40,260
...some knowledge, some information...

1096
01:18:42,531 --> 01:18:44,590
...is like a terminal disease.

1097
01:18:47,202 --> 01:18:48,362
It's...

1098
01:18:49,104 --> 01:18:50,401
...contagious...

1099
01:18:50,606 --> 01:18:52,039
...and it's fatal.

1100
01:18:56,779 --> 01:18:59,612
<i>Passion is the enemy of precision.</i>

1101
01:18:59,948 --> 01:19:02,678
<i>Forget the misnomer 'crime of passion. '</i>

1102
01:19:02,885 --> 01:19:07,015
<i>All crime is passionate. It's passion
that moves the criminal to act...</i>

1103
01:19:07,222 --> 01:19:10,555
<i>... that disrupts the static inertia
of morality.</i>

1104
01:19:10,793 --> 01:19:15,423
<i>The client's passion for this dead
woman had facilitated his downfall.</i>

1105
01:19:15,631 --> 01:19:17,531
<i>And the blackmailer's passion...</i>

1106
01:19:17,733 --> 01:19:19,530
<i>... would facilitate hers.</i>

1107
01:19:22,171 --> 01:19:23,934
<i>When you live with no passion...</i>

1108
01:19:24,139 --> 01:19:27,700
<i>... other people's passions
come into glaring relief.</i>

1109
01:19:27,910 --> 01:19:29,207
Bullshit, bullshit...

1110
01:19:29,411 --> 01:19:30,503
...bullshit!

1111
01:19:30,746 --> 01:19:33,078
Jesus! Would you stop it?

1112
01:19:34,450 --> 01:19:35,542
Stop it!

1113
01:19:35,751 --> 01:19:36,718
Jesus!

1114
01:19:36,919 --> 01:19:38,614
Control yourself, all right?

1115
01:19:38,821 --> 01:19:40,618
Control myself?

1116
01:19:40,823 --> 01:19:43,485
This is fucking bullshit!

1117
01:19:44,259 --> 01:19:47,558
Haven't I been good to you?
Haven't I been fucking incredibly...

1118
01:19:47,763 --> 01:19:52,462
...mindblowingly, fuckingly, divinely
generous as a fucking saint...

1119
01:19:52,734 --> 01:19:54,167
...you ungrateful fuck!

1120
01:19:54,770 --> 01:19:55,794
Hey, watch it...

1121
01:19:56,071 --> 01:19:57,060
...all right?

1122
01:19:57,272 --> 01:19:59,069
Ungrateful fuck!

1123
01:19:59,374 --> 01:20:00,500
Shut up!

1124
01:20:02,511 --> 01:20:03,842
Why?

1125
01:20:05,781 --> 01:20:08,545
I told you why.
I cannot live like this anymore.

1126
01:20:08,750 --> 01:20:11,981
I can't do it to Jess.
I can't do it to myself...

1127
01:20:12,187 --> 01:20:15,520
...and I'm sick and tired of working
for the Starks of the world...

1128
01:20:15,958 --> 01:20:19,587
...the lowest scum of the earth, buying
their way out of their own messes.

1129
01:20:19,795 --> 01:20:23,856
These people are victims of plots
and they need our help.

1130
01:20:24,800 --> 01:20:28,702
This guy is a murderer-at-large
who needs our help.

1131
01:20:29,805 --> 01:20:33,172
Their business equals their business.

1132
01:20:33,375 --> 01:20:36,105
We're not involved.
It has nothing to do...

1133
01:20:36,345 --> 01:20:37,277
...with us.

1134
01:20:37,479 --> 01:20:38,776
Do you believe that?

1135
01:20:39,314 --> 01:20:41,509
We're the good guys.

1136
01:20:42,818 --> 01:20:44,683
What are you talking about?

1137
01:20:44,887 --> 01:20:47,151
There aren't any good guys.

1138
01:20:47,656 --> 01:20:49,783
You realize that, don't you?

1139
01:20:49,992 --> 01:20:54,019
You realize there aren't evil guys
and innocent guys.

1140
01:20:56,732 --> 01:20:59,826
It's just a bunch of guys.

1141
01:21:03,071 --> 01:21:04,868
What am I supposed to do?

1142
01:21:07,075 --> 01:21:10,044
Just start taking meetings with people?

1143
01:21:12,014 --> 01:21:14,505
Just start talking with people?

1144
01:21:15,350 --> 01:21:16,578
Maybe.

1145
01:21:19,254 --> 01:21:20,744
Fuck that.

1146
01:21:25,194 --> 01:21:27,185
You know, you'll figure it out.

1147
01:21:28,363 --> 01:21:29,387
I mean...

1148
01:21:29,598 --> 01:21:31,395
...you're probably the best...

1149
01:21:31,600 --> 01:21:32,567
Excuse me?

1150
01:21:34,436 --> 01:21:37,064
Excuse me. You are the best.

1151
01:21:38,207 --> 01:21:40,573
I'm telling you that after this case...

1152
01:21:42,711 --> 01:21:44,269
...l'm finished.

1153
01:21:50,052 --> 01:21:51,713
I meant...

1154
01:21:52,721 --> 01:21:55,053
...what am I supposed to do...

1155
01:21:57,559 --> 01:21:59,550
...without you?

1156
01:22:08,403 --> 01:22:10,394
You want my honest opinion?

1157
01:22:13,141 --> 01:22:16,577
You should take all this money
that you've made...

1158
01:22:17,579 --> 01:22:19,240
...and move to Europe.

1159
01:22:19,915 --> 01:22:21,815
Meet a girl.

1160
01:22:22,751 --> 01:22:27,654
See the world. Really see the world.
Don't observe it. See what it's like.

1161
01:22:31,927 --> 01:22:33,588
What do you know?

1162
01:22:36,765 --> 01:22:39,563
I'm the greatest private investigator...

1163
01:22:39,768 --> 01:22:41,429
...in the world.

1164
01:22:56,952 --> 01:23:01,082
I'll go check for safe deposit boxes
under the name Kragen Vincent.

1165
01:23:01,723 --> 01:23:03,384
I don't know if that's necessary.

1166
01:23:05,193 --> 01:23:07,821
What Clearburg probably
meant when he says...

1167
01:23:08,030 --> 01:23:11,261
...there's no boxer with the name
Kragen Vincent...

1168
01:23:11,466 --> 01:23:13,058
...is that there's no boxes...

1169
01:23:13,802 --> 01:23:17,203
...with the name Kragen Vincent.
I think it's a typo.

1170
01:23:18,307 --> 01:23:20,207
Right. Right.

1171
01:23:21,376 --> 01:23:23,367
He probably used a different name.

1172
01:23:25,047 --> 01:23:26,810
That's what I think.

1173
01:23:27,649 --> 01:23:29,173
Well, then...

1174
01:23:29,384 --> 01:23:32,217
...l'll go get a beer
with my friend Bill.

1175
01:23:32,888 --> 01:23:34,515
I said, I think.

1176
01:23:35,390 --> 01:23:38,689
But you should go and check
just to make sure.

1177
01:23:41,396 --> 01:23:42,556
Fine.

1178
01:23:44,066 --> 01:23:46,534
But I really hope that you've heard me.

1179
01:24:00,849 --> 01:24:02,407
Sorry to startle you.

1180
01:24:03,518 --> 01:24:05,076
What are you doing here?

1181
01:24:05,554 --> 01:24:06,486
I followed you.

1182
01:24:08,523 --> 01:24:10,684
Back at my car,
this was on the windshield.

1183
01:24:10,892 --> 01:24:12,883
Another payment,
due tomorrow morning.

1184
01:24:14,262 --> 01:24:16,025
You sure you weren't followed?

1185
01:24:16,231 --> 01:24:17,596
I wasn't.

1186
01:24:18,200 --> 01:24:20,395
I told you how to contact me.

1187
01:24:20,602 --> 01:24:22,331
You should not have come here.

1188
01:24:22,537 --> 01:24:23,834
Is he in there?

1189
01:24:24,039 --> 01:24:27,907
If I walked in there now,
would Mr. Zero be happy to meet me?

1190
01:24:29,511 --> 01:24:30,603
Go home.

1191
01:24:31,113 --> 01:24:34,844
Right now. Make the payment tomorrow.
We're very, very close.

1192
01:24:35,050 --> 01:24:36,847
I'm sick of cooperating.

1193
01:24:37,152 --> 01:24:41,521
It used to be 2 or 3 weeks. Now it's
every two days. Why so close together?

1194
01:24:41,790 --> 01:24:46,284
Maybe he's nervous. Maybe he wants
to kill me. I should carry a weapon.

1195
01:24:47,662 --> 01:24:49,129
No, you shouldn't.

1196
01:24:49,731 --> 01:24:51,460
Look, just don't panic...

1197
01:24:51,666 --> 01:24:52,724
...all right?

1198
01:24:54,002 --> 01:24:55,492
How dedicated are you, really?

1199
01:24:57,239 --> 01:24:59,332
Your timing's impeccable.

1200
01:25:00,008 --> 01:25:02,135
- How do you mean?
- Never mind.

1201
01:25:03,245 --> 01:25:06,646
Maybe you've got some ambition
of your own. Maybe you want...

1202
01:25:06,848 --> 01:25:08,281
...to have your own firm.

1203
01:25:08,917 --> 01:25:12,717
You got me pegged. That's all I want
is to someday be Daryl Zero.

1204
01:25:13,355 --> 01:25:16,188
I'll give you $ 1 million
if you sell out your boss.

1205
01:25:16,691 --> 01:25:18,716
Just turn over your suspect.

1206
01:25:18,927 --> 01:25:20,758
Name and address.

1207
01:25:23,098 --> 01:25:24,565
$ 2 million...

1208
01:25:24,766 --> 01:25:27,257
...for a name and an address.

1209
01:25:27,536 --> 01:25:29,868
Cash.
We can go to the bank right now.

1210
01:25:30,439 --> 01:25:34,432
You'd give me $ 2 million so you
don't have to do this thing tomorrow?

1211
01:25:35,310 --> 01:25:37,039
I'm willing to give you $5 million.

1212
01:25:37,612 --> 01:25:39,443
How much does he pay you?

1213
01:25:40,549 --> 01:25:42,244
$5 million...

1214
01:25:42,451 --> 01:25:46,114
...so you can kill someone right away
instead of a day later.

1215
01:25:46,421 --> 01:25:47,513
For $5 million...

1216
01:25:47,722 --> 01:25:49,121
...you do it.

1217
01:25:57,299 --> 01:26:00,427
- What if I walked in right now...
- He's not in there.

1218
01:26:00,735 --> 01:26:02,396
What if I want to find out myself?

1219
01:26:03,071 --> 01:26:04,561
What would happen?

1220
01:26:05,240 --> 01:26:06,537
I'll shoot you.

1221
01:26:08,643 --> 01:26:10,577
Really. I will.

1222
01:26:11,913 --> 01:26:13,813
I have a gun and everything.

1223
01:26:17,152 --> 01:26:18,380
You're threatening me?

1224
01:26:20,422 --> 01:26:22,083
I'm threatening to kill you.

1225
01:27:32,327 --> 01:27:33,385
What?

1226
01:27:33,995 --> 01:27:36,327
Right before you jump off the plane...

1227
01:27:37,899 --> 01:27:40,527
...you stand there
with all the equipment on.

1228
01:27:40,735 --> 01:27:42,760
You know what to do,
you can't wait.

1229
01:27:43,004 --> 01:27:46,132
Is there a time when you think:

1230
01:27:46,341 --> 01:27:49,970
"What if it doesn't open? What if this
is the last thing I ever do?"

1231
01:27:50,178 --> 01:27:52,840
You're really stuck
on the skydiving thing.

1232
01:27:55,584 --> 01:27:58,917
I'm stuck on what it is that makes you
do very dangerous things.

1233
01:27:59,254 --> 01:28:02,587
Even dangerous things
can be safe if you're careful.

1234
01:28:03,358 --> 01:28:05,383
There's such a thing as
knowing the odds.

1235
01:28:05,594 --> 01:28:07,528
Quitting while you're ahead.

1236
01:28:08,863 --> 01:28:10,854
Quitting before you're dead.

1237
01:28:17,772 --> 01:28:20,366
You know, you, me...

1238
01:28:21,443 --> 01:28:26,380
...anyone could walk out here and
get killed by some drunk in a pickup.

1239
01:28:28,717 --> 01:28:31,777
I could slip in the shower
and break my neck.

1240
01:28:32,053 --> 01:28:34,385
When your number's up it's up.

1241
01:28:35,724 --> 01:28:38,887
There's no sense to it.
There's no justice.

1242
01:28:40,795 --> 01:28:42,592
Innocent people suffer...

1243
01:28:42,797 --> 01:28:45,129
...and murderers get away with it.

1244
01:28:45,967 --> 01:28:50,631
So when my number's up,
whether I'm walking down the street...

1245
01:28:54,743 --> 01:28:56,734
...or doing something else...

1246
01:28:57,145 --> 01:28:58,908
...that will be that.

1247
01:29:01,816 --> 01:29:05,081
And until then, I'm just going to do
what I need to do.

1248
01:29:07,656 --> 01:29:09,749
What is it you need to do?

1249
01:29:12,494 --> 01:29:13,984
I need...

1250
01:29:15,997 --> 01:29:17,828
...to try to feel right.

1251
01:29:20,268 --> 01:29:21,735
Can I get you anything else?

1252
01:29:21,936 --> 01:29:23,528
No, I think that's it.

1253
01:29:24,172 --> 01:29:25,662
Do you need anything?

1254
01:29:26,107 --> 01:29:27,438
I'm okay.

1255
01:29:28,677 --> 01:29:29,837
I'll take the check.

1256
01:29:30,345 --> 01:29:32,279
You got it. Be right back.

1257
01:29:33,615 --> 01:29:35,344
When I was a little girl...

1258
01:29:36,618 --> 01:29:40,679
...I used to hope that someday
I'd grow up to look like that waitress.

1259
01:29:46,628 --> 01:29:48,858
My mother had hair like that.

1260
01:29:51,132 --> 01:29:52,656
My natural mother.

1261
01:29:54,035 --> 01:29:55,195
Really?

1262
01:30:16,157 --> 01:30:18,523
God, I forgot how that works.
Wait a minute.

1263
01:30:18,727 --> 01:30:22,925
Can a person be considered
physical evidence? Like in a rape case?

1264
01:30:23,998 --> 01:30:26,660
You mean if the guy
doesn't know about the kid?

1265
01:30:29,337 --> 01:30:30,304
I think so.

1266
01:30:30,839 --> 01:30:32,568
We think so. Why?

1267
01:30:34,542 --> 01:30:35,440
You mean...

1268
01:30:35,844 --> 01:30:38,142
She is the evidence.

1269
01:30:38,346 --> 01:30:40,507
She's not Kragen's daughter.

1270
01:30:42,684 --> 01:30:44,413
She's Stark's daughter.

1271
01:30:52,527 --> 01:30:55,087
I must admit, I like this place.

1272
01:31:03,772 --> 01:31:04,932
What?

1273
01:31:05,607 --> 01:31:08,599
You said that you don't
speak to your family.

1274
01:31:11,446 --> 01:31:12,708
Why not?

1275
01:31:14,382 --> 01:31:16,543
I realize I'm prying...

1276
01:31:17,051 --> 01:31:19,042
...but what can I say? I'm prying.

1277
01:31:19,721 --> 01:31:21,450
I want to know about you.

1278
01:31:34,636 --> 01:31:37,298
Just look me in the eyes and talk to me.

1279
01:31:41,910 --> 01:31:43,070
All right.

1280
01:31:52,420 --> 01:31:54,479
My father was...

1281
01:31:55,590 --> 01:31:58,252
...an evil, abusive man.

1282
01:32:02,831 --> 01:32:04,822
And he killed my mother...

1283
01:32:06,100 --> 01:32:08,159
...when she was sleeping.

1284
01:32:09,938 --> 01:32:11,132
And then...

1285
01:32:11,339 --> 01:32:13,273
...he slit his wrists...

1286
01:32:14,843 --> 01:32:16,140
...when I was...

1287
01:32:16,344 --> 01:32:17,675
...13.

1288
01:32:29,023 --> 01:32:31,184
I don't talk about that...

1289
01:32:34,295 --> 01:32:35,455
...much.

1290
01:32:36,030 --> 01:32:38,464
I used to when it happened...

1291
01:32:39,701 --> 01:32:42,135
...and then one day I woke up...

1292
01:32:43,371 --> 01:32:44,463
...and...

1293
01:32:46,140 --> 01:32:47,471
...I don't know.

1294
01:32:50,478 --> 01:32:52,469
Everything was different.

1295
01:33:00,555 --> 01:33:02,147
How about that?

1296
01:33:08,162 --> 01:33:10,892
What doesn't kill you defines you.

1297
01:33:27,115 --> 01:33:32,348
<i>I don't believe in
an interventionist God</i>

1298
01:33:37,692 --> 01:33:40,183
<i>But I know darling...</i>

1299
01:33:40,528 --> 01:33:42,758
<i>... that you do</i>

1300
01:33:48,436 --> 01:33:50,404
<i>But if I did...</i>

1301
01:33:50,605 --> 01:33:53,938
<i>... I would kneel down and ask Him</i>

1302
01:33:58,613 --> 01:34:01,081
Not to intervene...

1303
01:34:01,282 --> 01:34:03,944
...when it came to you

1304
01:34:06,220 --> 01:34:09,587
<i>Or not to touch a hair in your head</i>

1305
01:34:09,791 --> 01:34:11,918
<i>Leave you as you are</i>

1306
01:34:12,126 --> 01:34:14,560
<i>If he felt he had to direct you</i>

1307
01:34:14,796 --> 01:34:17,287
<i>Then direct you into my arms</i>

1308
01:34:51,666 --> 01:34:55,193
Sometimes what you're looking
for is right in front of your nose.

1309
01:34:59,507 --> 01:35:01,600
That's what I've always said.

1310
01:35:32,707 --> 01:35:36,700
You just going to stand there watching
or you going to do something about it?

1311
01:35:51,726 --> 01:35:56,720
<i>And I don't believe
in the existence of angels</i>

1312
01:36:01,903 --> 01:36:03,632
<i>But looking at you...</i>

1313
01:36:03,838 --> 01:36:06,568
<i>... I wonder if that's true</i>

1314
01:36:12,346 --> 01:36:14,143
<i>But if I did...</i>

1315
01:36:14,348 --> 01:36:16,908
<i>... I would summon them together</i>

1316
01:36:22,690 --> 01:36:27,650
<i>And ask them to watch over you</i>

1317
01:36:46,614 --> 01:36:48,104
I got to get going.

1318
01:36:56,290 --> 01:36:59,384
So I'll see you around 6:00
at my place.

1319
01:37:02,063 --> 01:37:04,429
As soon as I'm done with my meetings.

1320
01:37:04,632 --> 01:37:05,724
Good.

1321
01:37:07,902 --> 01:37:09,130
Bye.

1322
01:37:14,742 --> 01:37:18,735
<i>At this point, you will receive
a final message on the pager.</i>

1323
01:37:18,980 --> 01:37:22,814
<i>Get on the corresponding bus
and take it to the end of the line.</i>

1324
01:37:23,251 --> 01:37:25,719
<i>Find the nearby bank of outhouses.</i>

1325
01:37:25,920 --> 01:37:29,879
<i>In center unit, find pair
of blue plastic garbage bags.</i>

1326
01:37:30,091 --> 01:37:32,321
<i>Make your deposit as usual.</i>

1327
01:37:41,769 --> 01:37:44,567
<i>When you have done this
get back on the bus.</i>

1328
01:37:44,772 --> 01:37:48,765
<i>Do not hesitate. Do not deviate
from the designated course.</i>

1329
01:37:49,343 --> 01:37:51,038
<i>You'll be monitored
at every interval.</i>

1330
01:37:51,946 --> 01:37:54,107
<i>We are prepared to act.</i>

1331
01:37:55,716 --> 01:37:58,981
<i>The words were similar but there was
a new component this time:</i>

1332
01:38:00,188 --> 01:38:01,382
<i>Desperation.</i>

1333
01:38:01,722 --> 01:38:04,452
<i>When you spend enough time around
the chemistry of desperation...</i>

1334
01:38:04,659 --> 01:38:06,593
<i>... you come to recognize the smell.</i>

1335
01:38:09,197 --> 01:38:11,427
<i>One desperate element is combustible.</i>

1336
01:38:11,632 --> 01:38:14,533
<i>More than one desperate element
is lethal.</i>

1337
01:38:52,907 --> 01:38:54,238
Shit.

1338
01:39:30,544 --> 01:39:32,535
Call 911. Hurry up.

1339
01:39:32,947 --> 01:39:34,039
All right.

1340
01:40:12,253 --> 01:40:13,220
Are you okay?

1341
01:40:14,755 --> 01:40:16,484
Do you know your name?

1342
01:40:17,425 --> 01:40:18,357
Who are you?

1343
01:40:19,760 --> 01:40:22,320
That's right, sir. Who are you?
You know?

1344
01:40:26,167 --> 01:40:28,397
- What happened?
- Cardiac arrest.

1345
01:40:28,936 --> 01:40:30,335
Are you a doctor?

1346
01:40:46,454 --> 01:40:48,786
<i>What's the name on that box, sir?</i>

1347
01:40:49,023 --> 01:40:50,650
<i>The name is Stark.</i>

1348
01:40:50,858 --> 01:40:52,689
<i>Gloria Stark.</i>

1349
01:40:53,294 --> 01:40:57,628
<i>According to our records, nobody's
been to that box for more than 20 years.</i>

1350
01:40:58,632 --> 01:41:00,463
<i>She lost the key.</i>

1351
01:41:01,369 --> 01:41:02,961
<i>Her father had it.</i>

1352
01:42:35,596 --> 01:42:38,156
<i>Hi, it's Gloria. I'll call you back.</i>

1353
01:42:40,501 --> 01:42:41,832
<i>Are you there?</i>

1354
01:42:55,683 --> 01:42:57,014
I'm here.

1355
01:42:59,353 --> 01:43:02,516
<i>I'm about to get on a plane
and be gone forever.</i>

1356
01:43:06,794 --> 01:43:08,887
I think that's a mistake.

1357
01:43:10,631 --> 01:43:13,191
Yeah, I don't see any choice.

1358
01:43:14,301 --> 01:43:16,132
<i>What if I come find you?</i>

1359
01:43:17,304 --> 01:43:19,534
<i>You're so sure that you could?</i>

1360
01:43:20,708 --> 01:43:23,768
<i>Thai Air. Flight 214.
Direct to Bangkok.</i>

1361
01:43:23,978 --> 01:43:25,809
<i>Departs in half an hour.</i>

1362
01:43:32,987 --> 01:43:34,818
Okay, it's over.

1363
01:43:35,489 --> 01:43:37,116
You figured me out.

1364
01:43:37,324 --> 01:43:39,155
Nobody else got close.

1365
01:43:39,827 --> 01:43:41,988
You know, he doesn't know about you.

1366
01:43:43,063 --> 01:43:45,031
He doesn't know he has a child.

1367
01:43:45,299 --> 01:43:46,357
<i>I know.</i>

1368
01:43:46,567 --> 01:43:48,398
<i>She never told him.</i>

1369
01:43:48,702 --> 01:43:51,262
She wanted him to deny
that he'd even touched her.

1370
01:43:51,472 --> 01:43:55,067
Then at the last minute, surprise!
Look who's a daddy.

1371
01:43:56,243 --> 01:43:58,575
And a rapist. And a murderer.

1372
01:44:02,349 --> 01:44:04,874
He hires Kragen Vincent.

1373
01:44:05,252 --> 01:44:08,881
<i>Kragen decides to hit her
in her motel room late at night.</i>

1374
01:44:09,089 --> 01:44:10,613
<i>He comes in the room...</i>

1375
01:44:10,991 --> 01:44:12,219
<i>... shoots her twice.</i>

1376
01:44:12,426 --> 01:44:17,659
<i>But he doesn't realize that you,
less than a year old, are in the room.</i>

1377
01:44:17,865 --> 01:44:20,891
<i>He doesn't see you at first,
because you're in a crawl space...</i>

1378
01:44:21,101 --> 01:44:25,003
...she's made for you by pulling the
corner of the bed closer to the wall.

1379
01:44:25,205 --> 01:44:29,574
<i>And even with the silencer on the gun,
and it all happening so quickly...</i>

1380
01:44:29,777 --> 01:44:31,335
<i>... you start crying.</i>

1381
01:44:31,545 --> 01:44:34,708
<i>He's got to do something.
You're screaming your lungs out now.</i>

1382
01:44:36,383 --> 01:44:39,375
<i>So he picks you up.
You stop crying.</i>

1383
01:44:40,387 --> 01:44:42,184
<i>And once he's got the baby...</i>

1384
01:44:42,389 --> 01:44:44,050
<i>... it's a done deal.</i>

1385
01:44:44,291 --> 01:44:45,883
<i>There he is...</i>

1386
01:44:46,293 --> 01:44:47,760
<i>... holding the infant.</i>

1387
01:44:47,962 --> 01:44:49,862
<i>That's when he decides...</i>

1388
01:44:50,064 --> 01:44:51,895
<i>... he'd rather risk it all.</i>

1389
01:44:52,399 --> 01:44:56,597
<i>He'd rather risk life in prison
than leave you in that room.</i>

1390
01:44:57,004 --> 01:45:00,030
<i>To protect you from Stark,
he gets rid of all the evidence.</i>

1391
01:45:00,274 --> 01:45:02,435
Diapers, diaper bag...

1392
01:45:02,710 --> 01:45:04,200
...bottles, blankets...

1393
01:45:04,511 --> 01:45:06,843
<i>... something on the dresser,
something in the sink...</i>

1394
01:45:07,047 --> 01:45:08,776
<i>... something hanging off a doorknob...</i>

1395
01:45:08,983 --> 01:45:10,575
<i>... something on the nightstand.</i>

1396
01:45:10,784 --> 01:45:13,344
And then he leaves his prints
everywhere.

1397
01:45:13,821 --> 01:45:17,052
<i>He leaves the body, takes the baby
and hauls ass out of there...</i>

1398
01:45:17,291 --> 01:45:20,055
<i>... because he knows he's got to
get you to his sister.</i>

1399
01:45:20,260 --> 01:45:22,820
You grow up thinking
Vincent is your father...

1400
01:45:23,030 --> 01:45:25,430
...and you're being raised
by your aunt and uncle.

1401
01:45:25,933 --> 01:45:26,797
<i>And then...</i>

1402
01:45:27,001 --> 01:45:28,935
<i>... Vincent comes clean.</i>

1403
01:45:29,169 --> 01:45:33,003
He told me what happened,
but he would never tell me who it was.

1404
01:45:33,507 --> 01:45:34,974
And then about...

1405
01:45:35,175 --> 01:45:39,009
...a year ago, I figured that out.
Mr. Stark.

1406
01:45:40,347 --> 01:45:42,747
So then you start writing letters.

1407
01:45:42,950 --> 01:45:45,783
Stark pays and the rest is history.

1408
01:45:47,955 --> 01:45:49,855
You got the whole thing.

1409
01:45:50,958 --> 01:45:52,357
You win.

1410
01:45:56,864 --> 01:45:59,025
<i>You saved his life this morning.</i>

1411
01:46:00,200 --> 01:46:01,462
I know.

1412
01:46:02,536 --> 01:46:05,630
I guess a person
can't escape their nature.

1413
01:46:07,708 --> 01:46:09,471
<i>How did you know...</i>

1414
01:46:09,810 --> 01:46:11,300
<i>... about me?</i>

1415
01:46:12,880 --> 01:46:14,643
Couple of things.

1416
01:46:16,150 --> 01:46:18,118
<i>And the receipt last night.</i>

1417
01:46:18,318 --> 01:46:19,478
I know.

1418
01:46:19,987 --> 01:46:21,716
I forgot to take it.

1419
01:46:23,323 --> 01:46:26,315
"Passion is the enemy of precision."

1420
01:46:30,497 --> 01:46:32,158
I got sloppy.

1421
01:46:37,404 --> 01:46:39,497
Are you going
to come looking for me?

1422
01:46:41,408 --> 01:46:46,175
Will you tell him about me so he can
have somebody kill me? Because he will.

1423
01:46:46,680 --> 01:46:47,874
<i>I know.</i>

1424
01:46:48,415 --> 01:46:50,747
<i>So what are we going to do about this?</i>

1425
01:46:52,453 --> 01:46:55,980
There's a man sitting on a bench
behind you.

1426
01:46:57,558 --> 01:46:58,320
Oh, God!

1427
01:46:58,525 --> 01:46:59,617
It's okay.

1428
01:47:00,527 --> 01:47:01,926
Relax.

1429
01:47:02,696 --> 01:47:04,061
He has an envelope.

1430
01:47:04,598 --> 01:47:09,035
<i>Inside are some fake identification
and some plane tickets.</i>

1431
01:47:09,269 --> 01:47:12,363
First Ecuador,
and then wherever you want.

1432
01:47:13,440 --> 01:47:15,499
Keep moving, first couple of months.

1433
01:47:15,709 --> 01:47:18,837
Stay out of westernized countries
for a while.

1434
01:47:19,113 --> 01:47:21,741
<i>Don't carry too much cash on your body.</i>

1435
01:47:22,049 --> 01:47:23,846
Give incorrect information...

1436
01:47:24,051 --> 01:47:25,450
...everywhere.

1437
01:47:26,220 --> 01:47:28,450
And never use your real name.

1438
01:47:33,727 --> 01:47:34,955
Thank you.

1439
01:47:37,898 --> 01:47:39,126
Thank you.

1440
01:47:40,567 --> 01:47:41,898
<i>If you knew I was here...</i>

1441
01:47:42,102 --> 01:47:44,070
...why didn't you come yourself?

1442
01:47:45,572 --> 01:47:47,267
<i>I'm not sure.</i>

1443
01:47:48,575 --> 01:47:50,475
I knew you'd be there...

1444
01:47:52,746 --> 01:47:54,976
...but I'd hoped you'd be here.

1445
01:47:56,817 --> 01:47:59,251
<i>You know, you could join me.</i>

1446
01:48:07,661 --> 01:48:09,492
A person can't escape...

1447
01:48:09,830 --> 01:48:11,320
...their nature.

1448
01:48:18,005 --> 01:48:19,939
That's what I thought.

1449
01:48:23,277 --> 01:48:25,268
<i>You're the best I've ever seen.</i>

1450
01:48:30,951 --> 01:48:32,509
So are you.

1451
01:48:39,526 --> 01:48:42,461
I've never said the words before...

1452
01:48:45,465 --> 01:48:46,830
...to anyone.

1453
01:48:49,870 --> 01:48:51,462
You don't have to.

1454
01:48:53,140 --> 01:48:54,971
I love you too...

1455
01:48:56,210 --> 01:48:57,871
<i>... Daryl Zero.</i>

1456
01:49:13,160 --> 01:49:16,186
<i>So ends my account
of the case that I have named...</i>

1457
01:49:16,396 --> 01:49:19,524
<i>"...The Case of the Man Who Got So
Stressed-Out Over His Lost Keys...</i>

1458
01:49:19,733 --> 01:49:21,963
<i>... That He Eventually Had
a Heart Attack...</i>

1459
01:49:22,169 --> 01:49:24,637
<i>... And It Turned Out
They Were in the Sofa All Along. "</i>

1460
01:49:25,339 --> 01:49:27,637
<i>I returned the first installment
of my fee...</i>

1461
01:49:27,875 --> 01:49:30,207
<i>... as I had not given
a complete explanation.</i>

1462
01:49:30,811 --> 01:49:32,642
<i>Some questions are for answering...</i>

1463
01:49:32,846 --> 01:49:35,644
<i>... others are better left
to torture and torment...</i>

1464
01:49:35,883 --> 01:49:37,145
<i>... for all eternity.</i>

1465
01:49:39,086 --> 01:49:41,077
<i>A nagging itch
for the rest of his life...</i>

1466
01:49:43,957 --> 01:49:46,983
<i>... seemed reasonable, especially since
I did solve his problem.</i>

1467
01:49:47,194 --> 01:49:50,163
<i>He got the tape he'd been waiting for
for so long.</i>

1468
01:49:50,364 --> 01:49:53,060
<i>He wouldn't be throwing anymore
money down the toilet.</i>

1469
01:49:53,267 --> 01:49:56,202
<i>And I gave back his keys.</i>

1470
01:50:04,044 --> 01:50:07,502
<i>This did, in fact, prove to be
my final work experience...</i>

1471
01:50:07,714 --> 01:50:10,114
<i>... with my longtime associate...</i>

1472
01:50:11,785 --> 01:50:14,754
<i>... though I have assured him
that when he someday finds...</i>

1473
01:50:15,022 --> 01:50:16,853
<i>... that he cannot live without me...</i>

1474
01:50:17,057 --> 01:50:19,719
<i>... his position will again
be available to him.</i>

1475
01:50:20,394 --> 01:50:24,728
<i>He thanked me and suggested
that I not hold my breath.</i>

1476
01:50:25,666 --> 01:50:28,328
<i>I also attended the funeral
of the hit man...</i>

1477
01:50:28,568 --> 01:50:31,901
<i>... who died not long after
these events described above.</i>

1478
01:50:32,639 --> 01:50:36,370
<i>For some reason, I felt
a certain kinship with this man...</i>

1479
01:50:36,576 --> 01:50:39,943
<i>... whose life was forever changed
after he failed to remain objective...</i>

1480
01:50:40,147 --> 01:50:42,479
<i>... about the lady blackmailer.</i>

1481
01:50:43,417 --> 01:50:45,977
<i>Which brings me
to the other participant.</i>

1482
01:50:46,653 --> 01:50:49,144
<i>I never made any attempt to find her.</i>

1483
01:50:49,690 --> 01:50:54,627
<i>But if my suspicion is correct, she's
flying through the sky as we speak.</i>

1484
01:50:55,395 --> 01:50:58,125
<i>"...plummeting towards the earth
like a falling bird..."</i>

1485
01:50:58,365 --> 01:51:01,300
<i>... to quote one of my favorite poets.</i>

1486
01:51:01,535 --> 01:51:06,472
<i>After investigating her, I found myself
in better shape than ever before.</i>

1487
01:51:08,208 --> 01:51:12,474
<i>To me, she will always be a singular,
unforgettable event:</i>

1488
01:51:15,248 --> 01:51:18,513
<i>The only time I ever took leave
of my objectivity.</i>

1489
01:51:18,719 --> 01:51:21,847
<i>Perhaps the most able blackmailer
of her time, she was at once...</i>

1490
01:51:22,055 --> 01:51:25,286
<i>... the worthiest opponent
and the greatest ally.</i>

1491
01:51:26,827 --> 01:51:29,819
<i>And the only woman I have ever...</i>

1492
01:51:31,999 --> 01:51:33,296
<i>The only woman.</i>

1493
01:51:33,500 --> 01:51:34,831
<i>Period.</i>

1494
01:51:37,838 --> 01:51:40,534
<i>And though I never would have
have anticipated it...</i>

1495
01:51:40,741 --> 01:51:44,905
<i>... in the end she did for me
what I have done for so many.</i>

1496
01:51:46,013 --> 01:51:49,847
<i>Helped solve a problem,
first by observation...</i>

1497
01:51:50,183 --> 01:51:52,413
<i>... then by careful intervention.</i>

1498
01:51:54,421 --> 01:51:55,911
<i>In other words:</i>

1499
01:51:56,556 --> 01:51:58,285
The Zero Effect.
