1
00:01:06,487 --> 00:01:08,478
Slavery

2
00:03:03,087 --> 00:03:08,115
In a basis of film - Peter ledsmena's clause
" girls in the neighbourhood " from new york city.

3
00:04:07,847 --> 00:04:08,996
Happy birthday, princess!

4
00:04:12,527 --> 00:04:13,642
Is this for me?

5
00:04:14,247 --> 00:04:15,521
Certainly, princess.

6
00:04:17,967 --> 00:04:19,525
It's for you.
Here.

7
00:04:20,967 --> 00:04:22,639
Congratulations... and happy birthday.

8
00:04:23,887 --> 00:04:24,922
Thank you.

9
00:04:25,127 --> 00:04:26,321
Where did you get it?

10
00:04:26,607 --> 00:04:28,086
What a nice bicycle!

11
00:04:29,207 --> 00:04:30,481
Yes it's fantastic,

12
00:04:31,007 --> 00:04:33,646
And it has a basket, side pockets, and it's 18 speed.

13
00:04:34,527 --> 00:04:36,483
These friends of yours, who are they?

14
00:04:37,607 --> 00:04:39,359
They help me with stuff, mom.

15
00:04:39,607 --> 00:04:40,756
Yea? What stuff?

16
00:04:42,527 --> 00:04:43,960
Answer me, what kind of stuff?

17
00:04:47,327 --> 00:04:48,442
Why!

18
00:04:49,927 --> 00:04:53,044
We take tourist on tours around the city,
i do it in english.

19
00:04:54,007 --> 00:04:55,007
What else?

20
00:04:55,247 --> 00:04:56,600
I got many brains!

21
00:04:58,247 --> 00:04:59,566
Later, princess.

22
00:05:00,287 --> 00:05:02,357
All right, come with me, and i'll show you around.

23
00:05:03,447 --> 00:05:06,166
No, it's too dangerous, with all these foreigners.

24
00:05:06,447 --> 00:05:07,926
Why do you act like this?

25
00:05:08,647 --> 00:05:10,603
Mom, i bought it, it's paid for.

26
00:05:11,127 --> 00:05:14,403
Why can't you behave, like your sister for an example..

27
00:05:14,607 --> 00:05:19,679
You wouldn't talk to me like this, if your father was here.

28
00:05:20,007 --> 00:05:21,326
Well he's not here!

29
00:05:28,487 --> 00:05:29,522
Be back later, mom.

30
00:05:30,487 --> 00:05:33,126
Will you be back later today to spend the night?

31
00:05:33,527 --> 00:05:35,916
You will be back later, no?

32
00:05:38,047 --> 00:05:40,242
You can't use this bike, i forbid it.

33
00:05:41,007 --> 00:05:43,840
Why not? The lord created bicycles for this purpose.

34
00:05:44,087 --> 00:05:47,238
The lord did not create bicycles, and i wont let you ride it!

35
00:05:52,367 --> 00:05:54,358
Time is money, my friends!
I got to run!

36
00:06:06,767 --> 00:06:09,122
My name is veronica.
How are you?

37
00:06:10,407 --> 00:06:11,476
And?

38
00:06:13,447 --> 00:06:15,199
I am happy to be here.

39
00:06:15,527 --> 00:06:17,995
That's real good, you're getting better.

40
00:06:26,807 --> 00:06:28,007
Welcome to mexico city.

41
00:06:28,008 --> 00:06:29,042
Thanks you.

42
00:06:29,207 --> 00:06:30,242

Ok. Girls let's go.

46
00:06:43,367 --> 00:06:47,443
Girls, this is vadim yochenko

47
00:06:47,527 --> 00:06:49,597
And this is...

00:06:52,127 --> 00:06:54,401
Welcome to mexico.

50
00:06:55,527 --> 00:06:58,040
What a pretty smile.

51
00:07:00,167 --> 00:07:03,556
Let's go, we'll talk in the car.

52
00:07:06,087 --> 00:07:08,806
Oh i forgot... can i get your passports please.

53
00:07:11,167 --> 00:07:14,318
It's ok.
Thanks you.

54
00:07:16,007 --> 00:07:18,360
Exuse me, but there's something wrong?

55
00:07:18,487 --> 00:07:20,522
What's wrong?

56
00:07:20,767 --> 00:07:24,802
The passports.

57
00:07:25,087 --> 00:07:28,682
Forgive me, but why have you taken our passports?

58
00:07:29,327 --> 00:07:30,521
Visas.

59
00:07:32,087 --> 00:07:33,884
But we already have visas.

60
00:07:38,007 --> 00:07:42,762
Shut up, don't forget we know where your parents live,
and we also know about your little son.

61
00:08:20,487 --> 00:08:24,320
Hey! What's up my friend?
You're alone?

62
00:08:24,427 --> 00:08:27,702
I can show you around, (?)...
museum of furtility?

63
00:08:27,807 --> 00:08:29,340
No thank's... i'm cool

64
00:08:29,387 --> 00:08:30,087
What?

65
00:08:30,127 --> 00:08:32,240
Mui... cool... suave?

66
00:08:32,247 --> 00:08:35,939
Hey! But you got to take a look mr. Cool.
Look, just look.

67
00:08:36,327 --> 00:08:39,080
Please, look... look... just a second.

68
00:08:39,327 --> 00:08:42,521
Here... please

69
00:08:43,607 --> 00:08:46,357
You want a true mexican experience?

70
00:08:47,327 --> 00:08:50,521
We got treasures that look better then these fucking pyramids.

71
00:08:52,047 --> 00:08:54,800
Your dollars will go a long long way down here.

72
00:08:55,727 --> 00:08:58,321
The one on the left there - Rosita, la ra rosita.

73
00:08:59,007 --> 00:09:03,363
She's first class, she gives real good head.

74
00:09:11,247 --> 00:09:15,559
Come on! We're close.

75
00:09:27,527 --> 00:09:30,758
Forgive me my friend, you wont get to taste today
any mexican pussy.

76
00:09:31,287 --> 00:09:32,402
Don't kill me.

77
00:09:32,607 --> 00:09:36,680
Yes sir you'll be giving us everything, ok.

78
00:09:36,887 --> 00:09:39,957
You know what, if i was you?
I bet you hate all mexicans right now.

79
00:09:40,847 --> 00:09:45,443
Guys, what do we do to gringos?
Who disrespect the mexicans?

80
00:09:48,487 --> 00:09:49,715
Show him!

81
00:09:52,967 --> 00:09:54,480
Die bitch.

82
00:10:42,367 --> 00:10:44,403
Down with americans, america sucks!

83
00:10:48,727 --> 00:10:51,002
To my brother with love, from adriana.

84
00:12:19,927 --> 00:12:22,600
No! No! No!

85
00:12:41,687 --> 00:12:43,120
Look's like they're enjoying themselfs.

86
00:12:44,007 --> 00:12:45,360
You're not kidding!

87
00:12:48,127 --> 00:12:50,402
Hey! This bicycle looks familier.

88
00:12:52,127 --> 00:12:55,516
Hey! Hey...
stop!

89
00:13:00,047 --> 00:13:01,799
What's the matter? What's going on?

90
00:13:04,327 --> 00:13:05,396
What's the matter?

91
00:13:09,287 --> 00:13:12,482
Hey you, son of a bitch,
you stole my sister bicycle.

92
00:13:12,487 --> 00:13:13,881
No! I found it in the street!

93
00:13:13,887 --> 00:13:15,202
Tell that to your mother!

94
00:13:15,447 --> 00:13:16,596
Realy!
Realy!

95
00:13:16,807 --> 00:13:17,842
I found it beleave me!

96
00:13:18,167 --> 00:13:19,395
Alright!
Alright!

97
00:13:19,767 --> 00:13:21,995
I'll show you, where i found it!

98
00:13:22,167 --> 00:13:24,395
Let's go! Hurry up move! Faster!

99
00:13:30,167 --> 00:13:31,486
Show me! Where you found it?

100
00:13:31,767 --> 00:13:33,882
Right there.

101
00:13:48,867 --> 00:13:50,882
Hey!

102
00:14:17,167 --> 00:14:18,236
Hey! Where you going?

103
00:14:18,487 --> 00:14:20,159
Jorge, what are you doing?
That was my sisters!

104
00:14:22,207 --> 00:14:23,720
Why?, why?

105
00:14:26,167 --> 00:14:28,078
Did you see the girl on the bicycle?

106
00:14:28,567 --> 00:14:31,320
My son is a sleep, and i can't...
god help you.

107
00:14:32,367 --> 00:14:36,121
Nobody saw a damn thing,
it's time to go and see don victor.

108
00:14:39,007 --> 00:14:40,326
Let's go!

109
00:14:48,767 --> 00:14:51,076
If she was taken in this part of city,
it means the russian took her.

110
00:14:51,487 --> 00:14:52,966
Russian?

111
00:14:53,207 --> 00:14:54,322
They're animals.

112
00:14:54,527 --> 00:14:56,438
They buy and sell anything they get there hands on.

113
00:14:57,727 --> 00:14:59,797
A pretty girl, like your sister, it's very possible,

114
00:15:00,047 --> 00:15:02,436
And for them a virgin... is solid gold.

115
00:15:04,607 --> 00:15:08,066
She's only 13, don victor.
Please tell me, where i can find her!

116
00:15:08,087 --> 00:15:10,520
Help me please!
With the russian?

117
00:15:10,527 --> 00:15:12,042
They're everywhere.

118
00:15:12,247 --> 00:15:14,044
Heard about globalization?
It's rediculess.

119
00:15:15,967 --> 00:15:18,276
How about in mexico city, don victor.

120
00:15:18,527 --> 00:15:21,758
What are you gonna do?
Go there and knock on his door?

121
00:15:22,567 --> 00:15:24,922
I am not afraid of them.
Besides, my friends will back me up.

122
00:15:30,727 --> 00:15:34,163
These two blockheads?
Look at them!

123
00:15:34,647 --> 00:15:36,797
You don't have any idea about the russian!
You guys wont be a treat to them

124
00:15:37,487 --> 00:15:38,681
They will go with me!

125
00:15:45,007 --> 00:15:47,999
Why the long faces?
Are we not in fact brothers?

126
00:15:48,247 --> 00:15:50,761
She is my sister, god damn!
You chickenshits!

127
00:15:50,927 --> 00:15:55,876
It's my sister, for christ sake!
Kiss my ass, jerkoffs!

128
00:15:57,007 --> 00:15:58,520
Calm down!
Calm down!

129
00:16:00,247 --> 00:16:03,159
Calm down right now!
Stay calm!

130
00:16:04,087 --> 00:16:05,645
Take it easy...
easy.

131
00:16:09,687 --> 00:16:12,838
If they really taken her, she's probably in route by now.

132
00:16:13,847 --> 00:16:15,041
In route where?

133
00:16:16,927 --> 00:16:19,487
After they kidnapp the girls, they get'm across the border

134
00:16:19,967 --> 00:16:27,521
As soon as possible and there they sell them, they do the same thing over and over again.

135
00:16:28,487 --> 00:16:32,196
If it is who i think it is, they always use the same routine.

136
00:16:32,807 --> 00:16:34,923
They stay usually in a place close by the airport.

137
00:16:35,847 --> 00:16:41,202
And they get more money if they sell them to...
pedophiles.

138
00:16:56,927 --> 00:16:57,962
Thanks you

139
00:16:58,927 --> 00:17:00,962
In there

140
00:17:09,327 --> 00:17:10,999
Don't touch me, please.

141
00:17:11,487 --> 00:17:18,837
Come on, lay down and enjoy yourself.
We know, where your son is.

142
00:17:53,567 --> 00:17:55,523
Mexico - The cheapest way there?

143
00:18:00,287 --> 00:18:02,437
This here is the best choice.

144
00:18:06,007 --> 00:18:09,124
I need to make some money, so i can take my son to america.

145
00:18:19,327 --> 00:18:20,919
Mom is back!

146
00:18:24,167 --> 00:18:29,605
You'll be very happy with this travel package, i agree it's the best way,

147
00:18:31,567 --> 00:18:34,206
The names and the address of my parents, is that realy necessary?

148
00:18:34,487 --> 00:18:36,796
Usual bureaucratic procedure.

149
00:18:48,087 --> 00:18:49,087
It's here.

150
00:18:54,367 --> 00:18:58,076
Why! Is it necessary for us to be here?

151
00:18:59,767 --> 00:19:01,246
No it's not necessary.

152
00:19:50,447 --> 00:19:51,641
Take this.

153
00:20:21,807 --> 00:20:27,245
Vitamins... i'll help for the pain.

154
00:20:32,807 --> 00:20:36,277
Take it,
understand!

155
00:21:34,367 --> 00:21:36,244
Do you speak spanish?

156
00:21:41,887 --> 00:21:43,286
English?

157
00:21:44,687 --> 00:21:46,166
A little.

158
00:21:46,527 --> 00:21:49,200
Me too... a little.

159
00:21:59,847 --> 00:22:01,724
I wish all this would end.

160
00:22:04,007 --> 00:22:09,081
I want to go home, i miss my mother.

161
00:22:22,167 --> 00:22:23,919
You believe in it?

162
00:22:28,647 --> 00:22:30,319
You pray to it?

163
00:22:32,607 --> 00:22:36,236
Yes.
Very strong.

493
00:59:05,020 --> 00:59:06,692
He does't know, where

00:59:08,179 --> 00:59:09,372

Your mom always loves you. Always.

01:00:14,425 --> 01:00:16,494
It's party time.

501

520
01:03:16,850 --> 01:03:20,761
So... what did your friend say?

521
01:03:21,168 --> 01:03:22,566
Good news, he's on the case.

522
01:03:22,767 --> 01:03:25,075
I gave him all the information.
The password all that stuff.

523
01:03:26,365 --> 01:03:29,162
He's gonna pass it on to his
friend at the internet crime unit.

524
01:03:29,604 --> 01:03:31,400
They'll take care of it.

525
01:03:32,282 --> 01:03:35,398
Password? That's what the
guy gave you in the bathroom.

526
01:03:36,160 --> 01:03:38,832
Yea, he bought that kid on the internet.

527
01:03:39,799 --> 01:03:43,028
He was the highest bidder, he
flew all the way from thailand.

528
01:03:43,277 --> 01:03:45,709
He paid $25,000.00, that's how it works.

529
01:03:47,754 --> 01:03:49,709
I am sorry i didn't tell you before.

530
01:03:50,953 --> 01:03:53,227
I just wanted to make sure.
I'm just trying to protect you.

Jorge this is good news.

533
01:03:58,509 --> 01:04:02,625
Jesus! You don't trust anybody, do you?

534
01:04:04,426 --> 01:04:08,463
Not everyone is your enemies, you
know. Try a little optimism sometime.

535
01:04:09,063 --> 01:04:10,178
It wont kill you.

536
01:04:11,502 --> 01:04:13,378

540
01:04:37,049 --> 01:04:38,083
Do you drive?

541
01:04:38,568 --> 01:04:40,239
You want me to drive?

542
01:04:40,487 --> 01:04:41,522
I'm tired.

543
01:04:41,766 --> 01:04:43,643
But if i drive, we need
to play another music.

544
01:04:43,925 --> 01:04:45,358
What is your problem with my music?

545
01:04:46,124 --> 01:04:48,557
It puts me to sleep, you want
us to get killed or something?

546
01:04:55,399 --> 01:04:56,798
You can't stay here.

547
01:04:56,999 --> 01:04:59,830
Two guys and three girls, that's
to many! It's gonna look suspicios!

548
01:05:02,475 --> 01:05:04,864
It's only two girls.

549
01:05:05,193 --> 01:05:08,831
Have you gone cracy? Look i
know that, we leave tomorrow.

550
01:05:11,751 --> 01:05:12,785
What?

551
01:05:12,990 --> 01:05:14,184
Nothing.

552
01:05:22,785 --> 01:05:24,661
Hello? How you doing?

553
01:05:27,023 --> 01:05:31,572
Listen, we've been on the
road day and night, simply...

554
01:05:32,660 --> 01:05:36,412
Okay calm down, calm down.

555
01:05:38,377 --> 01:05:39,855
All right, i've got it. Yea.

556
01:05:42,415 --> 01:05:49,045
Son of a bitch. They set up
the next auction for tomorrow.

557
01:05:49,452 --> 01:05:50,725
You've got to be kidding me.

558
01:05:50,971 --> 01:05:54,757
That's what they want, she's next.

559
01:05:55,728 --> 01:05:58,036
We have to be in new jersey by tomorrow.

560
01:06:00,166 --> 01:06:02,201
That's unreal.

561
01:06:05,683 --> 01:06:06,718
Get up.

562
01:06:09,521 --> 01:06:11,112
Get up!

01:06:21,875 --> 01:06:23,148
Good morning.

564
01:07:10,770 --> 01:07:16,125
Good morning. What kind of cop are you?

565
01:07:16,886 --> 01:07:18,921
I'm in the fraught department.

566
01:07:19,125 --> 01:07:20,194
What kind of fraught?

567
01:07:20,484 --> 01:07:21,803
Insurance, mainly.

568
01:07:22,763 --> 01:07:24,957
You work for insurance companies?

569
01:07:25,522 --> 01:07:26,590
Well, yes.

570
01:07:27,161 --> 01:07:29,628
I think, you work for the wrong side.

571
01:07:43,593 --> 01:07:45,105
You have mexicans friends?

572
01:07:45,352 --> 01:07:48,023
I have mexicans friends.
A very good friend in fact.

573
01:07:48,270 --> 01:07:51,341
He works in the office
right next to mine.

574
01:07:51,788 --> 01:07:53,584
You only have one mexican friend?

575
01:07:55,346 --> 01:07:56,859
A good friend.

576
01:07:58,385 --> 01:08:01,295
How can you live in texas, and not
have hundreds of mexican friends?

577
01:08:04,182 --> 01:08:07,172
Okay wise ass do you have
a hundred american friends?

578
01:08:07,620 --> 01:08:08,972
All my friends are americans.

579
01:08:09,139 --> 01:08:10,174
Really?

580
01:08:10,459 --> 01:08:11,493
Yes.

581
01:08:11,698 --> 01:08:17,372
All mexicans are americans, and all my friends
are mexicans, so, all my friends are americans.

582
01:08:17,935 --> 01:08:21,050

america and south america.

583
01:08:21,453 --> 01:08:25,569
That's america. And not

610
01:11:19,641 --> 01:11:21,870
What are you saying? With what?

611
01:11:22,240 --> 01:11:26,310
People from agency came by.
They have shown me documents.

612
01:11:26,557 --> 01:11:28,036
They've taken them from me.

613
01:11:28,516 --> 01:11:32,951
Mamma they're gangsters.
Mamma they're holding me... help!

And your son.

01:12:19,890 --> 01:12:22,448
Get your ass out there, and keep it out of site.

620
01:13:14,222 --> 01:13:18,770
You pay for this, i will show you.

621
01:13:29,294 --> 01:13:38,846
No! No! No!

622
01:16:33,919 --> 01:16:34,953
Come in.

623
01:16:40,155 --> 01:16:41,190
You're late,manual.

624
01:16:43,034 --> 01:16:44,102
Here.

625
01:16:51,469 --> 01:16:52,663
Sit down.

626
01:16:59,185 --> 01:17:00,504
Your, probably adriana, yes?

627
01:17:02,864 --> 01:17:03,898
Yes.

628
01:17:04,783 --> 01:17:12,174
What a beautiful name.
Is this what everyone calls you?

629
01:17:15,457 --> 01:17:18,254
You have no idea, how to
deal with young girls, do you?

630
01:17:20,295 --> 01:17:21,807
Where are the other girls?

631
01:17:29,970 --> 01:17:32,163
You hear me? Where are the other girls?

632
01:17:33,048 --> 01:17:40,041
The brazilians kept one of them, and the other...

633
01:17:40,684 --> 01:17:43,754
We lost on the way here,

634
01:17:44,720 --> 01:17:46,994
She had an accident.

635
01:17:47,720 --> 01:17:48,994
Which one?

636
01:17:51,119 --> 01:17:52,346
Which one?

637
01:17:52,598 --> 01:17:54,110
The one from poland.

638
01:17:54,957 --> 01:17:56,594
Another accident?

639
01:17:58,115 --> 01:18:02,868
One more accident, and we wouldn't have any
buisness at all

640
01:18:03,352 --> 01:18:04,831
Looks like you can't handle this job.

641
01:18:05,191 --> 01:18:09,068
You have to deal with vadim on this
and it's not going to be very pleasant.

642
01:18:10,669 --> 01:18:11,896
What a loser.

643
01:18:15,666 --> 01:18:17,098
You're an impocill.

644
01:18:19,264 --> 01:18:21,493
Let's go, adriana, we got things to do.

645
01:18:22,702 --> 01:18:25,579
I'm leaving got to take care of buisness.

646
01:18:37,055 --> 01:18:39,329
Hello! Welcome to the holiday inn, how may i help you?

647
01:18:39,933 --> 01:18:41,809
I need two rooms if you got them.

648
01:18:42,052 --> 01:18:43,246
Single or double, sir?

649
01:18:43,492 --> 01:18:44,606
Let's see what you got..

650
01:18:46,490 --> 01:18:51,323
It's fake. You have internet here?

651
01:18:51,647 --> 01:18:53,239
Sure, in the amusment center overthere.

652
01:18:54,046 --> 01:18:55,922
The passwords is (?), right?

653
01:18:57,324 --> 01:18:59,200
Would you like to pay on a credit card?

654
01:19:01,522 --> 01:19:05,115
Excuse me, my wallet is here.

655
01:19:06,522 --> 01:19:08,115
Be right out.

656
01:19:11,416 --> 01:19:13,754
Hey... 2 pm

657
01:19:14,755 --> 01:19:17,347
Here is your room key, you go up and get some rest.

658
01:19:17,834 --> 01:19:19,869
I'll be in his office, i'm going overthere now.

659
01:19:22,272 --> 01:19:25,228
Detective sheridon, how exactly did you get involved in this case?

660
01:19:25,630 --> 01:19:27,859
Ray not only investigates insurance fraught.

661
01:19:28,069 --> 01:19:30,627
But in resent ocations he also get's involved with...

662
01:19:31,547 --> 01:19:35,663
Detective jefferson, no offence, but i like to hear the story fom detective sheridon himself.

663
01:19:36,544 --> 01:19:39,894
The bottom line is, this girl will be auctiont of in a few hours,

664
01:19:39,942 --> 01:19:43,939
And i need to know what you guys gonna do about that auction,

665
01:19:43,940 --> 01:19:48,455
Look we've been monitering this group for quit some time.

666
01:19:49,378 --> 01:19:51,492
We know where there jersey oporations are.

667
01:19:52,176 --> 01:19:54,928
Ray, the real problem is that this thing is global

668
01:19:55,734 --> 01:19:59,850
Even though this group might be based in mexico city, they have oporations all over the u. S..

669
01:20:00,492 --> 01:20:01,890
And over every one of the continents.

670
01:20:02,091 --> 01:20:05,001
Their server for example, is located somewhere in maldives.

671
01:20:05,529 --> 01:20:07,280
Their banking is in south africa.

672
01:20:07,808 --> 01:20:09,718
There are many jurisdictions at work here

673
01:20:09,927 --> 01:20:12,917
Cia, state department, the
interpol extr... extr...

674
01:20:13,445 --> 01:20:19,152
So what we do is fallow the money, connect all the dots and we'll come up with the source.

675
01:20:20,282 --> 01:20:25,670
I get all that, but you know where the oporation is in new jersey.

676
01:20:26,039 --> 01:20:27,038
Yea.

677
01:20:27,838 --> 01:20:31,955
But you can't be bother and do anything about this little mexican girl,

678
01:20:31,996 --> 01:20:34,863
You got bigger plans.

679
01:20:35,993 --> 01:20:40,030
That's what you're saying, or did i hear you wrong?

680
01:20:41,391 --> 01:20:43,108
Well gentlemen, if you excuse me?

681
01:20:44,829 --> 01:20:45,863
Thanks you

682
01:20:46,428 --> 01:20:47,746
We are the fucking gringos, aren't we?

683
01:20:49,027 --> 01:20:50,061
Sorry?

684
01:20:50,786 --> 01:20:53,617
I said we are the fucking gringos!

685
01:21:39,561 --> 01:21:42,869
Hi patty, i'll be home in a few more days.

686
01:21:45,238 --> 01:21:48,930
I want you to take out a big junk
of money from our savings.

687
01:21:48,936 --> 01:21:51,870
But i don't wanna do it unless you say it's
alright.

688
01:21:52,254 --> 01:21:54,823
I guess i wont have to ask, what it's for.

689
01:21:55,712 --> 01:22:00,830
I'll tell you all about it when i get
home, and i promise no more secrets.

690
01:22:01,869 --> 01:22:03,142
Have you found her?

691
01:22:05,507 --> 01:22:06,781
Karla?

692
01:22:08,346 --> 01:22:10,415
Karla that's her name?

693
01:22:13,143 --> 01:22:14,212
Yea.

694
01:22:15,582 --> 01:22:22,098
Ray... if you find your daughter,
i want you to bring her home.

695
01:22:29,615 --> 01:22:32,111
If i do, i will.

696
01:22:32,932 --> 01:22:35,451
Patty...
yea?

697
01:22:38,490 --> 01:22:40,081
Thanks you

698
01:22:41,129 --> 01:22:43,358
You shouldn't thank, me for loving you ray.

699
01:22:45,087 --> 01:22:46,565
Bye bye.

700
01:22:56,541 --> 01:22:58,689
Hey, hey, what's going on?

701
01:22:58,690 --> 01:23:02,717
I got us some money, you and me gonna do the auction.

702
01:23:02,798 --> 01:23:03,932
And what about your friend?

703
01:23:04,437 --> 01:23:05,755
Forget about him.

704
01:23:09,054 --> 01:23:11,891
Sure you got tell to me something gringo.

705
01:23:15,231 --> 01:23:16,788
Why are you doing this?

706
01:23:27,465 --> 01:23:28,533
Who is it?

707
01:23:29,984 --> 01:23:31,177
It's my daughter.

708
01:23:31,423 --> 01:23:32,696
Your daughter?

709
01:23:33,182 --> 01:23:34,296
Yea.

710
01:23:36,340 --> 01:23:38,619
This is what you've been looking for?

711
01:23:39,419 --> 01:23:42,807
That picture was taken 10 years ago, i realy don't know what i'm looking for.

712
01:23:51,253 --> 01:23:56,005
I met her mother just after i was married

713
01:23:56,330 --> 01:24:00,965
To patty my wife,
and i was a happely married man

714
01:24:02,767 --> 01:24:08,301
And then i met elenore,
and everything changed. She was...

715
01:24:12,888 --> 01:24:20,192
Oh she was so... wild and alive.

716
01:24:23,916 --> 01:24:27,350
I don't know what i was expecting
but i was ready to give up everything.

717
01:24:29,033 --> 01:24:35,024
My marrige everything, so stupid!
Stupid...

718
01:24:36,269 --> 01:24:42,453
And then she met this other guy and...

719
01:24:42,945 --> 01:24:48,736
He was everything i wasn't, i mean...
she found him exiting... and alive...

720
01:24:50,822 --> 01:24:56,655
Anyway and then she told to me, that she was
pregnant with his child. And a...

721
01:24:58,538 --> 01:25:04,893
That kind of did it, i left and a...
went back to patty

722
01:25:05,134 --> 01:25:06,408
Did patty take you back?

723
01:25:07,613 --> 01:25:08,613
Yeap.

724
01:25:10,532 --> 01:25:11,930
Go figure.

725
01:25:12,531 --> 01:25:14,202
That would never happen in mexico.

726
01:25:21,006 --> 01:25:25,713
Just a few days ago i get a knock at my door from a couble of officers and they told me that elenore has died.

727
01:25:25,864 --> 01:25:27,881
From an overdose.

728
01:25:28,522 --> 01:25:31,558
And they found this letter in her apartment with my name on it.

729
01:25:32,680 --> 01:25:35,557
That she's written 10 years
before, but never sent.

730
01:25:36,598 --> 01:25:46,991
And she says she needs money, and that karla is my daughter.

731
01:25:48,032 --> 01:25:51,503
Which i always... wonderd about.

732
01:25:52,390 --> 01:25:54,539
You didn't know she had a daughter did you?

733
01:25:57,267 --> 01:25:58,461
I did.

734
01:26:03,984 --> 01:26:06,019
We had our ups and downs years

735
01:26:06,303 --> 01:26:09,179
We helped her out all we could,
but she's always in trouble

736
01:26:09,621 --> 01:26:10,621
And the daughter?

737
01:26:10,860 --> 01:26:14,931
In foster homes mostley,
but i always managed to get her back.

738
01:26:17,377 --> 01:26:18,775
After you.

739
01:26:27,252 --> 01:26:31,526
She went over the border to
juarez about ten years ago.

740
01:26:31,730 --> 01:26:33,924
Probably at the time when she
wrote you that letter.

741
01:26:34,688 --> 01:26:35,916
Was her daughter with her?

742
01:26:36,447 --> 01:26:37,846
We have no idea.

743
01:26:38,406 --> 01:26:42,920
We do know, that she got back here
two years later,

744
01:26:43,106 --> 01:26:44,320
The girl was gone

745
01:26:44,442 --> 01:26:47,791
And the house was still a mess.
Did you...

746
01:26:47,819 --> 01:26:52,826
Did you ask her what happend to the daughter.

747
01:26:54,317 --> 01:26:57,549
She told us that she left her with her daddy.

748
01:26:57,574 --> 01:27:03,626
We didn't know what kind of daddy she was talking about?
We couldn't proof anything, what are you talking about?

749
01:27:03,633 --> 01:27:09,982
We think, she sold the girl
i don't know, but with junkies that happends

750
01:27:13,228 --> 01:27:14,979
She sold her.

751
01:27:18,746 --> 01:27:25,623
If i... if i gotten that letter 10 years before, everythingl would be different.

752
01:27:26,063 --> 01:27:29,834
Me and patty always wanted a child.

753
01:27:32,418 --> 01:27:33,976
She's pretty, ain't she?

754
01:27:35,737 --> 01:27:37,947
Yes, she has beautiful eyes.

755
01:27:38,775 --> 01:27:41,412
Green.. Like her mothers.

756
01:27:46,811 --> 01:27:49,983
So, that's what you where doing in the house in juarez.

757
01:27:50,409 --> 01:27:55,986
Well, by the time you cliemed in to my trunk,
i've pretty much givin' up on everything.

758
01:27:56,807 --> 01:28:03,801
But now i relized i gave up to soon.
Wich is something i do a lot of...

759
01:28:04,807 --> 01:28:05,801
I guess.

760
01:28:09,200 --> 01:28:14,710
Veronica, i hope, you are happy in heaven.
If you can talk to virgin maria for me,

761
01:28:14,757 --> 01:28:19,908
And ask her to have a good and kind person buy me at the auction.

762
01:28:20,754 --> 01:28:25,064
I'm very scared. Please help me.

763
01:28:29,754 --> 01:28:30,064

policy.

If you're not a cop it means, once you've been with her you wont talk.

854
01:36:11,710 --> 01:36:15,187
But if you're a cop you wont
fuck her and then you're fucking death.
