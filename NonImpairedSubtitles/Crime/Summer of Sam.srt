00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:47,192

162
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,956

The shit's gonna hit the fan.

181
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:13,236
Petrocelli, you're gonna like this part.
He left a note.

182
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:16,036
No shit? He left a note?

183
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:18,833
Who is this guy?
Fuckin' William Shakespeare?

184
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:23,037
Yes, Lou... This could be the break.

00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:26,076
Somebody bag this.

186
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:28,714
Get one of our boys
to take it down to forensics.

187
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:31,400
(officer) eddie, let's get a shot.

Hey! Hey, Vinny! You can't be there!

Six and seven, Lou, like you said.

195
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:21,957
Oh, my God!

196
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:24,116
Vincent, what's...?

197
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:27,036
(spluttering)

198
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:31,549

00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:50,152
- Somebody got killed?
- The .-Calibre Killer is back.

204
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:53,636
Baby, please take me home.
Come on, l gotta get outta here.

205
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:55,958
Victims...

206
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:58,036
..six...

207
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:01,152
..seven.

208
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:05,114
(radio) All news, all the time.
This is WlNS.

209
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:10,798
You give us  minutes;
we'll give you the world.

210
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:13,639
WlNS news time at the tone, ..

211
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:16,752
lt happened again last night.
More terror, more bloodshed.

212
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:20,190
The .-Calibre Killer striking again,
leaving two more dead.

213
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:22,709
The killer left a note
at the murder scene,...

214
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:25,832
..but the police have not released
its contents to the press.

215
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:28,758
Parents continue to warn
their children not to go out...

216
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:32,509
..and keep their daughters home,
afraid they will park in Lovers Lane...

217
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:34,710
..and end up another victim of the killer.

218
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:39,431
lt's hot and hazy and humid. People trying
to go out at night, but they're afraid to.

219
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:42,358
They're afraid
this mad killer will strike again,...

220
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:44,630
..shooting them down in cold blood.

221
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,158
Good morning, Ma.

222
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:49,236
Not a good morning for me. l'm losin'.

223
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:51,191
Couldn't you put some clothes on?

224
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:53,276
Morning? lt's . in the afternoon.

225
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:55,960
Nice. Nice tux, ed.

226
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:59,356
lt's your mother's idea.
She got me a gig with a wedding band.

227
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:01,630
Can l borrow  bucks, Ma?

228
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:03,398
- Whoa!

229
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:05,670
- Take it from the kitty.
- That's for food!

230
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:07,711
This is what l mean with this kid.

231
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:11,310
Ritchie, why not work for a living?
Only the coloured and Spanish sponge.

232
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:12,998
Mind your own business.

233
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:16,032
l gotta sing for $ tonight,
and he gets ? No, no, no.

234
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:18,833
$ dollars, and you should
make him work the game.

235
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:22,111
All right, but he's not gonna work
the game. Ritchie, take $.

236
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:24,515
- l'm out.

237

238
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:32,311
- Hey, Ritchie.

239
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:34,749

240
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:37,713
- What kids?
- Bad thing. Real bad thing.

241
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:40,436
(chattering in ltalian)

242
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:43,196
(children squealing)

243
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:49,076
(girl) Barracuda!

244
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:51,592
(woman) Get out of the water!

245
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:06,192

the Post and the Daily News all week.

246
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:07,719

247
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:11,549
(man #) You should be payin' us

248
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:14,274
- Joe, l been spendin' a lot of money.
- Oh, come on!

249
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:17,119
(Joe) Shut the fuck up, all right?
Just listen to this.

250
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:20,630
''Police officials declined
to discuss the contents of the note,...

251
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:24,514
..but our unofficial source said
it was written by a homicidal maniac,...

252
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:27,393
..a real sicko who lives
in a nightmare world.''

253
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:30,273
- Joey, do l look pale to you?
- You look all right, Vin.

254
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:32,152
Hey, Anthony, do l look pale to you?

255
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:34,396
Yeah, you look like a piece of mozzarella.

256
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:37,239
- You guys are fuckin' funny.
- Holy shit! Look at this.

257
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:40,193
- This is our neighbourhood.
- There's Layton Avenue.

258
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:42,629
- Joe, look. We're famous.
- Let me see that.

259
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:46,919
l'd lay five-to-one
the killer's from right here.

260
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:51,238
- You think the killer's from around here?
- Don't you think we'd notice a sicko?

261
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:54,557
What do you think makes them sickos?
You don't notice 'em.

262
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:58,150
You think this was a random killing?
He just pulled off the highway?

263
00:14:58,280 --> 00:15:00,430
You don't think
he knew where he was going?

264
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:03,120
- Joey, l need another lude.
- You just popped it.

265
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:06,471
lt's not working. Give me another one.
Don't be fuckin' cheap!

266
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:08,556
That was some heavy shit you saw.

267
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:11,069
- l'd be freaking out if l was you.
- Yeah, l am.

268
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:13,919
l'd be freaked out
since the killer knows you saw him.

269
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:17,112
- What do you mean, he saw me?
- He might think you're a witness.

270
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:19,196
l'm serious. l saw this on a news show.

271
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:21,834
lf he saw your licence plate,
he knows where you live.

272
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:23,916
You think l'm number eight?

273
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:26,634
- They stick around.
- They see who comes by...

274
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:28,352
Oh, shut the fuck up!

275
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:30,835
l only saw victims.

276
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:34,032
l didn't see nobody.
Don't start spreadin' that shit, asshole!

277
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:36,276
What's the matter? Leave him alone!

278
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:38,675
Oh, that's real funny, right? Ha-ha!

279
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:40,995
What's the matter? You can't take a joke?

280
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:42,553
No, l can't!

281
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:45,832
- Vinny, relax.
- Come on. We're playin' with you.

282
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:48,269
Here, here, come on. Take a half a lude.

283
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:51,275
Go home and get some sleep, all right?

284
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:54,312
- Fuckin' guy can't take a joke.
- Leave him alone.

285
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:56,476
One fuckin' lude ain't gonna work on him.

286
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:58,636
Why don't you guys go
fuckin' take a walk?

287
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:01,672
We were just jokin'.
Holy shit! Look at this creature!

288
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:03,756
Hey, guys, l got live lobsters.

289
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:06,872

Where were you last night?
You shoot two people?

292
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:15,155

- And half-dead. What is this shit?
- They're good! $ each.

294
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:20,874
Get the fuck outta here

295
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,956
These are good for making brisque.

296
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:27,278
- Brisque this, you junkie!
- Joey, l'm gonna go cold turkey.

297

309
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:05,675
All right, all right, all right. Here, here.

310
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:08,234
Here's your $.
Now get the fuck outta here.

311
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:12,638
- Woodstock, l need some smoke.
- l'm handling that now. l got nickels.

312
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:16,955
Right. l'll take two then.

313
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:20,598
Hey, Ritchie, you heard about the killer?

314
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:22,711
Yeah, yeah, l heard.

315
00:17:22,840 --> 00:17:25,229
- What's up, Vin? Not gonna say hello?
- Hello.

316
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:27,396
Where the fuck were you last night, huh?

317
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:29,431
You drove past me outside the club.

318
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:32,870
Do me a favour and drop this stupid
accent. Talk to me for real, huh?

319
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:35,199
All right.

320
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:39,552
- Why didn't you come in and say hello?
- l wasn't dressed for disco dancing.

321
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:41,750
(mocks accent)
l wasn't dressed for dancing!

322
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:45,111
Look at him! He was dressed
for Halloween, this fuckin' goblin.

323
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:49,472
Hey, porcupine...
Vinny saw the dead bodies last night.

324
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:52,319
- You saw the bodies?
- (Vinny) Yeah, l saw the bodies.

325
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:57,389
l was on my way home. But l didn't
see no fuckin' killer, you numbnuts!

326
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:59,670
So don't fuckin' spread that word around.

327
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:01,836
(car approaches)

328
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:04,633
Hey, here comes Ruby the skank. Ruby!

329
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:13,635
Yeah, but... l thought you said
your parents were in Hawaii.

330
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:16,035
First europe, then Hawaii.

331
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:22,474
You know, Ron,...
we've been dating for three weeks now...

332
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:25,319
..and all you ever do is take me to motels.

333
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:28,238
OK? You wanna see me again?

334
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:32,512
- You introduce me to your parents.
- Must you always bring up my parents?

335
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:35,279
- Are you getting out of the car?
- Yeah, l gotta go.

336
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:37,789
What about our weekend in the Catskills?

337
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:40,196
l've already paid for the room.

338
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:42,356
Then you can go there
and you can jerk off.

339
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:44,675
Cos that's what you are, a fuckin' jerk-off!

340
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:46,392
Fuck you, you dago wop skank!

341
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:48,909
- (all) Whoa!
- Hey, what did you say?

342
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:51,713
- ''Dago wop skank''?
- This doesn't concern you.

343
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:54,718
- That's my fuckin' sister!
- Stay away from the car.

344
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:58,276
Get the fuck out of the car!
Get out of the car!

345
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:04,356
You fucker!

346
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:08,356
Go back home, pretty boy!

347
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:11,477
(all laughing)

348
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:13,636
He ain't showin' his face here again!

349
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:17,469
Hey, Ruby, come over here. l'm horny.
l mean lonely. l need a hug.

350
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:19,556
Then go home to your mother.

351
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:23,309
- Twat you say? l cunt hear.
- l have an in-fuck-tion in my ear.

352
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:26,876
Don't you assholes ever grow up?
What the fuck is your problem?!

353
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,070
- Ruby!
- Hey, is that Ritchie?

354
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:31,998
- That freak don't want you.
- Get the fuck out of here!

355
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:35,109
Ritchie, hey! How are you?

356
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:37,356
- Hey, Ruby.
- How ya doin'? You look good.

357
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:39,391
- You look great.
- Good enough to eat?

358
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:41,795
Hey, l like the new look.
What, it's... punk?

359
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:44,388
Yeah. You should come
to the city sometime.

360
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:46,317
- Maybe check out my band.
- They suck.

361
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:48,749
Yeah, they suck real good.
Just like you, Ruby.

362
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:52,793
- l learned from your mother,... dick.
- You let your sister talk like that to me?

363
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:55,832
- Come on, get lost.
- (Ruby) Leave me the fuck alone.

364
00:19:56,240 --> 00:20:00,199
- Hey, you live in Manhattan now?
- l did as of last night. l got evicted.

365
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:03,596
- Will you stop talking like that?
- You been in London, too?

366
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:07,679
No, but it's... it's all in the attitude.
lt's all in the attitude.

367
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:09,870
(copies accent) ln the attitude.

368
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:13,959
Well, l-l gotta go.
My father's gonna kill me. l'll see you.

369
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:17,038
- lt was great seeing you.
- Yeah, you too. You look good.

370
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:20,350
- You take care of yourself, Ruby.
- Yeah.

371
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:23,392
Be careful.
Ritchie, come here. l wanna talk to you.

372
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:25,078
Take it easy on the rebound.

373
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:30,319
- Whoa, whoa.
- You tryin' to knock me down?

374
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:32,396
(Ritchie) Whoa, whoa, whoa. Slow down.

375
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,911
(Vinny) Don't tell nobody.

376
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:39,634
Now, it's bad enough
that l balled her, right?

377
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:43,435
But then some sick side of me
had to drive Dionna right past the spot...

378
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:46,791
..where l was just sticking it
up her cousin's ass, you know?

379
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:50,037
Shit. And that's where l saw
the dead bodies, right there.

380
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:53,948
You know what?
God spared me. He spared me, man.

381
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:56,196
Cos it's a fuckin' omen. No, l'm serious.

382
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:59,312
He fuckin'... He let me go.
What the fuck could this mean?

383
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:01,510
lt means something. What does it mean?

384
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:03,596
l don't know. What do you think?

385
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:06,553
l think God's tellin' me
that l'm gonna burn in hell...

386
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:08,591
..if l don't stop cheatin'.

387
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:13,113
l told you you weren't ready
to get married.

388
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:15,196
You don't fuckin' listen.

389
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:18,756
Cos l fuckin' thought l was gonna
stop cheatin' when l got married.

390
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:21,917
And now l'm just fuckin' cheatin'
a lot more than l ever did.

391
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:24,554
You know, l thought
the man up there understood.

392
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:26,671
l thought He would fuckin' understand!

393
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:28,756
God has got nothing to do with this, Vin.

394
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:31,758
Oh, come on, Ritchie.
Yes, He does. Yes, He does.

395
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:36,715
God is tellin' me, ''You shouldn't
be doing these things with your wife.''

396
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:39,070
- What things?
- Don't be stupid. You know.

397
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:41,634
You know, butt-fucking,...

398
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:44,274
..69, doggie-style.

399
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:47,631
And that's the message.
God is saying, ''Cut that shit out.''

400
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:50,274
''Otherwise, l won't
spare you the next time.''

401
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:52,356
That's what He's saying.

402
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:55,756
l'm telling you, l swear l think
the guy saw my licence plate.

403
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:59,998
l think he's after me. l tell you, l'm
gonna be number eight. My life is over.

404
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:04,318
You don't gotta worry about anybody
comin' after you or any omen.

405
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:07,796
What the fuck am l gonna do?
What if l can't stop?

406
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:11,310
- What if l got some sort of hang-up?
- You don't got any hang-ups.

407
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:14,910
You know, once you're deviated,
you can't go back. You know that.

408
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:18,669
Why don't you just tell Dionna you like
these things? Maybe she'll do it.

409
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:21,394
- You don't do that shit with your wife.
- Why not?

410
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:25,513
- Nah, it's a fuckin' sin.
- ''Please, can l put it up your ass?''

411
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:28,598
- ''Just one time.''
- Don't fuckin' make fun of me, man.

412
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:30,790
- ''Let me put it up your ass.''
- Shut up.

413
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:32,876
''Oh, Dionna...''

414
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:36,637
What do you want me to tell you?
Get a fuckin' divorce.

415
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:39,513
Divorce is fuckin' evil.
You got some bad advice.

416
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:41,710
''evil'' spelled backwards is ''live.''

417
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:43,910
You're a corny fuck, you know that?

418
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:48,791
Dionna? Dionna, l gotta talk to you.

419
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:51,036
Vinny, what are you doing here?

420
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:53,958
- l just gotta talk to you for a minute.
- Now?

421
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:58,073
Honey, we're in trouble.
We got Luigi here and we're not ready.

422
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:00,156
- Just sit down with me here.
- Vinny!

423
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:03,356
What's wrong with you?

424
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:06,438
l need to talk to you, please.
And listen to me for once, OK?

425
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:08,516
Could you? Could you do that for me?

426
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:11,598
- All right.
- All right?

427
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:16,913
What l saw last night...
made me think about a lot of things, OK?

428
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:19,998
lt opened up my eyes really wide
to everything.

429
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:23,035
And those murders made me realise...

430
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:28,636
..how much l love you.

431
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:32,796
l love you, Dionna.

432
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:35,354
And l swear to God...
l swear, l promise...

433
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:38,392
l promise you and God
that l'm gonna be the best husband...

434
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:40,431
..that you ever had in your entire life.

435
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:44,269
lf l had eight tongues, it wouldn't be
enough to tell you how much l love you.

436
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:49,076
- OK. You swear to God?
- l swear to God, l love you.

437
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:52,876
OK.

438
00:23:58,440 --> 00:24:00,158
l'm so sorry about everything.

439
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:01,633
l love you so dearly.

440
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:10,114
Baby, um,... l'm in the middle of work.

441
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:12,310
Dad's in trouble and l gotta get stuff out.

442
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:14,510
Make up an excuse
and let's go somewhere.

443
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:16,676
- Baby, l can't.
- l'll take you to dinner.

444
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:19,553
Why don't you stay here?
l'll make you something nice.

445
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:22,956
l'll be back in  minutes.
Sit down. l'll get you a glass of wine...

446
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:26,516
- l don't wanna wait  minutes.
- A glass of wine!

447
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:33,915
Daddy,... Luigi's veal. He's waiting.

448
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:36,996
He'll wait. He'll wait.

449
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:39,999
How's that husband Vinny of yours?
He's all right?

450
00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:43,271
Well, he was all shook up,
but he's... he's a lot better now.

451
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:46,198
- Thank God.
- You don't seem so good today.

452
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:48,311
How am l doing? l'm concerned, OK?

453
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:50,556
l'm very worried about your safety.

454
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:54,309
Did you see those parents on television
crying for their kids?

455
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:58,513
l don't want to be on the news talking
about the daughter that l used to have.

456
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:01,234
(man) When's the food coming?
Tomorrow?

457
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:04,508
(man #) Get rid of this thing, too.
lt's disgusting.

458
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:07,509
- Hi. Here's your order.
- Thank you, honey.

459
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:09,710
- Beautiful.
- Thank you for waiting.

460
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:12,798
- Tell your father he's a great man.
- That looks great.

461
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:15,354
- Thank you, honeybunch.
- So long, sweetie.

462
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:23,558
(man) Luigi, look who's here.
Starsky and Hutch.

463
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:26,513
(man #) Are we double-parked
outside or somethin'?

464
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:32,154
You gonna invite us to sit or what?

465
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:34,635
You both got asses. Feel free to use 'em.

466
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:38,033
Mario? Mario!

467
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:40,230
Si, signor Luigi?

468
00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:42,590
Two setups for New York's finest.

469
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:44,711
Ah, sure, paesano.

470
00:25:44,840 --> 00:25:47,991
You're gonna invite us to a meal?
That's against regulations.

471
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:51,715
- You sit at my table, you eat.
- Nobody's counting, huh? Sit down.

472
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:54,833
Detective, you ever have
Veal Sorrentino?

473
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:57,428
- Uh, no, l haven't.
- Well, you're gonna have it now.

474
00:25:57,560 --> 00:26:01,553
- Sounds delicious.
- That's ltalian for veal delight.

475
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:05,639
- What is it?
- lt's ltalian food. Veal Sorrentino.

476
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:09,514
You need your energy to catch
the criminals of the world.

477
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:12,996
l like that. That's good.
Sorrentino, here you go.

478
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:15,076
Try to catch this one.

479
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:18,868
Compliments to the chef. Yeah.

480
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,673
Your partner tell you
he ran errands for me as a kid?

481
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:23,438
No.

482
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:27,599
Yeah. When he was a pipsqueak.
Too small even to piss straight.

483
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:31,030
- No, he never told me that.
- (Luigi) Never told you other things.

484
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:34,232
My partner knows l'm from here.
Can we get down to business?

485
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:36,112
What business?

486
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:38,276
We need your help.

487
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:42,228
What do you want me to do?
Arrest myself?

488
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:44,316
(laughing)

489
00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:48,038
l wish this was a joking matter,
but it's not. lt's serious.

490
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:51,277
l want to talk to you about
this crazy son-of-a-bitch killer.

491
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:53,072
We need your help.

492
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:56,510
You got a hundred cops on the task force.

493
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:58,631
You need my help? l'm only a plumber.

494
00:26:58,760 --> 00:27:01,115
Luigi, you know l wouldn't be here
if l didn't have to be.

495
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:04,591
l'm asking you : This guy,
how many people did he kill?

496
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:06,870
Three, four, five?

497
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:10,629
And with no disrespect, detective,
in Harlem last night,...

498
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:15,151
..your people, the coloureds, how many
of each other did they kill? Seven, eight?

499
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:19,353
eight, nine, at least.
And on Saturday, , if we're lucky.

500
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:21,869
- OK, l'm out.
- Take it easy. Sit, sit.

501
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,911
So... so...

502
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:27,874
So... why didn't you ask me
who killed them? Huh?

503
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:30,994
Not enough press in it for ya?

504
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:33,270
Not enough Post
or Daily News headlines?

505
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:36,756
There's a homicidal maniac
runnin' around the neighbourhood.

506
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:39,030
You don't wanna do anything about it?

507
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:44,031
You have been busting my balls
ever since you got promoted.

508
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:46,791
Now, why is that?

509
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:48,990
Wasn't l good to you
when you were a kid?

510
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:51,031
Didn't l take you to Yankee Stadium?

511
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:53,116
Didn't you meet Mickey Mantle?

512
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:57,074
He signed a baseball,
''To Louie, from Mickey Mantle. ''

513
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:59,760
Motherfuck the Mick!
Willie Mays was the man.

514
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:02,314
Get outta here! Mick was the guy.

515
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:05,398
- He was the guy. Come on.
- (Luigi) All right, enough.

516
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:08,637
And the family. Your family...
Didn't l take care of them?

517
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:10,716
l treated you like a son.

518
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:15,673
And now you have the balls to come here
and ask me to do you a favour?

519
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:17,756
Never!

520
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:22,356
When you wanted to become a cop,
did you come and ask me?

521
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:25,631
Did you ask for my blessing? No.

522
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:31,037
And you could have been
a great plumber, as good as me.

523
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:35,398
(sighs)

524
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:38,478
l'm gonna read you something,
but it can't leave this table.

525
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:40,955
Not even the newspapers
know about this.

526
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:43,513
Read it.

527
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:45,471
''Dear sir, l am deeply hurt...

528
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:48,114
..by the newspaper
calling me a woman hater.''

529
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:52,789
''l'm not. But l am a monster.
l'm a little brat.''

530
00:28:52,920 --> 00:28:57,357
''l am the Son of Sam.
Sam loves to drink blood.''

531
00:28:57,480 --> 00:29:00,756
(man) ''Go out and kill,''
commands Father Sam.

532
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:03,952
Behind our house, some rest.

533
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:08,832
Mostly young, raped and slaughtered,
their blood drained.

534
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:11,350
Just bones now.

535
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:14,199
- (yelling)
- Papa Sam has me locked in the attic too.

536
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:16,834
Shut that dog up!

537
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:18,916
l can't get out.

538
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:24,712
Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!

539
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:27,991
When l look out the attic window
and watch the world go by,...

540
00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:29,473
(yelling)

541
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:31,955
..l feel like an outsider.

542
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:35,117
l am on a different wavelength
than everybody else.

543
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:38,435
Programmed to kill.

544
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:41,510
(man) Do you know where...

545
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:43,232
No!

546
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:47,999
However, to stop me,...

547
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:49,997
..you must kill me.

548
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:51,758
l am the monster.

549
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:54,678
- Beelzebub.
- Beelzebub. The chubby behemoth.

550
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:56,756
l love to hunt.

551
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:58,836
(flies buzzing)

552
00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:02,113
Prowling the streets,
looking for fair game.

553
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:05,152
lt must be the water they drink.

554
00:30:08,360 --> 00:30:12,433
l live for the hunt. My life. Blood for Papa.

555
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:16,235
Sir, l don't wanna kill any more.

556
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:18,718
No, sir, no more.

557
00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:20,796
But l must honour thy father.

558
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:25,718
(screaming)

559
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:31,749
l wanna make love to the world.

560
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:34,997
l love people. l don't belong on Earth.

561
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:37,429
Return me to yahoos.

562
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:39,718
l wanna wish you all a happy Easter.

563
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:43,473
May God bless you in this life
and the next.

564
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:45,511
And for now,...

565
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:48,108
..l say goodbye and good night.

566
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:52,558
Lasciami. Non mi toccare!

567
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:54,989
(wailing)

568
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:58,556
Police, let me haunt you
with these words...

569
00:30:58,680 --> 00:31:00,477
l'll be back.

570
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:02,875
- ''l'll be back.''
- l'll be back.

571
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:05,349
To be interpreted as...

572
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:06,435
..bang-bang-bang...

573
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:09,633
..bang-bang... bang.

574
00:31:09,920 --> 00:31:12,388
''Yours in murder, Mr Monster.''

575
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:17,917
- Holy Jesus Christ.
- Holy shit!

576
00:31:18,040 --> 00:31:19,996
Will you excuse me for a minute?

577
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:25,671
(whispering) Luigi...

578
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:30,590
Sugno che oggi ho tanto... Pe' Vossia...

579
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:34,395
Chisto, chisto madman é uno nostro.

580
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:36,756
Come on. Aiutami.

581
00:31:41,080 --> 00:31:43,036
Non te preoccupare.

582
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:46,154
Ci penso io pe' iddu.

583
00:31:48,280 --> 00:31:50,236
Grazie. Grazie.

584
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:53,197
Basket catch.

585
00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:56,039
Hey, pally, that catch in the ' series...

586
00:31:56,160 --> 00:32:00,392
(commentator) There's a long drive
way back to centre field.

587
00:32:00,520 --> 00:32:02,511
Way back! And it is caught!

588
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:04,153
(cheering)

589
00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:07,236
He got lucky!

590
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:10,388
(sound) l'm gonna love you

591
00:32:10,520 --> 00:32:14,035
(sound) Like nobody's ever loved you

592
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:16,754
When you sang that song,
l fell in love with you.

593
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:19,519
(sound) Come rain or come shine

594
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:21,710
- eddie Sabatini.
- That's me, baby.

595
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:23,353
eddie Sabatini!

596
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:26,074
(sound) High as a mountain

597
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:29,988
(sound) Deep as a river

598
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:33,673
Oh, baby, come here.

599
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:36,030
(sound) Da-da-daah!

600
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:39,516
(sound) Just when you met me

601
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:43,551
(sound) lt was just one of those things

602
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:47,116
(sound) But don't, don't you ever bet me

603
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:49,708
- Oh, my God, Ma!
- Oh, my God! Ritchie!

604
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:51,717
- l'm sorry!
- Get outta here, Ritchie!

605
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:53,398
Ritchie!

606
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:56,239
(Eddie) Go inside, Helen! Jesus!

607
00:32:57,920 --> 00:32:59,069
Get in here now!

608
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:02,590
Get in here. Get in here.
Come on, kid. We're still newlyweds here.

609
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:06,156
Goddamn it, Ritchie!
We don't see you for a month!

610
00:33:06,280 --> 00:33:08,236
You come back.
You're gone for a week.

611

612
00:33:10,280 --> 00:33:14,034
Look, look. Thing is...

613
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:17,072
She packed your shit up.
We want you to stay in the garage.

614
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:19,156
l'm not stayin' in the fuckin' garage!

615
00:33:19,280 --> 00:33:23,114
- This ain't the fuckin' Sherry-Netherland.

616
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:25,674
lt's our house.
We can do what the fuck we want!

617
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:29,634
You should be happy that we're
lettin' you stay in the fuckin' garage.

618
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:31,796
- Ma, this guy's kickin' me out!
- Helen!

619
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:36,038
- He's makin' me live in the garage!
- Helen, talk to him!

620
00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:39,550
- He's kicking me out of my own house!
- lt won't be bad in the garage.

621
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:41,352
l'll give you money to fix it up.

622
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:44,153
You can play your guitar loud,
whatever you want!

623
00:33:44,280 --> 00:33:45,395
l want to d...

624
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:48,796
Your mother and l need
our fuckin' privacy, OK?

625
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:51,275
From now on, you ring
the fuckin' doorbell.

626
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:54,517
You got that? Ring the front doorbell.
Give me your keys.

627
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:57,359
- Come on, give me the keys.
- l ain't givin' you...

628
00:33:57,480 --> 00:34:00,153
- Ma! Ma!
- Helen!

629
00:34:00,280 --> 00:34:03,317
What are you doin', Ma?
Please don't fuckin' do this to me.

630
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:05,032
Oh, Ritchie, stop it.

631
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:07,310
l fuckin' hate you,
you fat piece of shit!

632
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:09,192
(Helen) Ritchie, get back here!

633
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:12,915
- Helen, it's him or me!
- eddie, he is my son, goddamn it!

634
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:15,508
Now l got a case of blue balls!
You happy?

635
00:34:15,640 --> 00:34:17,073
- eddie!
- Huh?

636
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:20,954
The Son of Sam killer who has been
targeting women with long hair...

637
00:34:21,080 --> 00:34:24,152
..has caused brunettes
to run to their hairdressers...

638
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:27,511
..to dye their hair blonde
as protection against this madman.

639
00:34:27,640 --> 00:34:30,234
But if you come in earlier,
l can't do your colour...

640
00:34:35,160 --> 00:34:38,755
By the time you get to the altar,
you might say ''l did'' instead of ''l do.''

641
00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:41,553
Shut up. You sound like my fuckin' father.
OK, Vinny?

642
00:34:41,680 --> 00:34:44,240
- Yeah, but l'm not your father, am l?
- No.

643
00:34:44,360 --> 00:34:47,238
Hey, Vinny, l heard you saw the killer.

644
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:49,635
- Who told you that shit?
- Just heard it around the neighbourhood.

645
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:51,876
l didn't see anybody, OK?
Remember that.

646
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,309
OK. Look, thanks for the haircut.

647
00:34:56,080 --> 00:34:57,354
Use it.

648
00:34:58,920 --> 00:35:01,036
See ya, Ruby.

649
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:10,511
Congratulations.
You just realised you are married.

650
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:12,198
Yeah, well, l'm tryin'.

651
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:16,154
- Does Gloria need a shampoo girl?
- Hey, Gloria! You need a shampoo girl?

652
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:20,159
- What do you think?
- There you go. See?

653
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:22,271
What about Dionna?
She need waitresses?

654
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:24,914
- Nah, she got somebody last week.

655
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:28,557
(Gloria)
l mean, l'm smart, l'm young, l'm pretty...

656
00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:31,433
You got two out of three right there.

657
00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:34,438
(Cockney accent)
Oi! lf it isn't Warren Beauty.

658
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:37,632
Hey, l get more ass than he does any day,
you fuck.

659
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:40,274
- Hey, Ritchie.

660
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:43,472
l copped that Who's Next album.
l was thinking about you.

661
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:45,113
- They're great, right?
- Yeah.

662
00:35:45,240 --> 00:35:48,391
Fuckin', those guys are like
the godfathers of punk.

663
00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:50,795
You know that song Baba O'Riley?

664
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:54,037
- My favourite. You know who wrote it?
- englebert Humperdinck?

665
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:56,515
- Uh-uh.
- What, you don't think l know?

666
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:58,471
Come on, l know. Pete Townshend.

667
00:35:58,600 --> 00:36:01,034
- How'd you know that?
- l read the album credits.

668
00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:03,116
l mean, the only thing l don't get is...

669
00:36:03,240 --> 00:36:05,549
..why are those four guys
pissing on a big rock?

670
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:08,558
- Like in a photo shoot...
- Are you two getting married?

671
00:36:08,680 --> 00:36:11,148
- Can l get to work?
- Are you jealous?

672
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:14,113
- Please!
- l need a favour.

673
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:15,195
What's goin' on?

674
00:36:15,320 --> 00:36:19,393
- eddie's got me movin' into the garage.
- What do you want me to do?

675
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:21,715
- Loan me $.
- Ah, get outta here!

676
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:23,592
- Come on.
- You beggar, you.

677
00:36:23,720 --> 00:36:26,280
- No, wait. The garage could be cool.
- Fuck that!

678
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:29,312
No, forget that. Stay with me.
Dionna'll take care of you.

679
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:33,035
Seriously, no. You could fix it up.
Huh? Have privacy.

680
00:36:33,160 --> 00:36:35,310
l mean, really, fuck livin' in the house.

681
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:39,319
l'll live in the fuckin' garage,
you stay with my fuckin' crazy family.

682
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:41,635
l'll live in my fuckin' car
before l do that.

683
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:43,716
All right, here. Shut up and take .

684
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:47,674
- Don't ever say l never gave you nothin'.
- Are you loaded these days?

685
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:49,870
- And use it well, OK?
- Thank you.

686
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,230
(Ruby)  bucks?  fuckin' bucks?

687
00:36:52,360 --> 00:36:54,555
l can turn that place
into a palace with  bucks.

688
00:36:54,680 --> 00:36:57,194
Hey, l'm not doin' anything later.

689
00:36:57,320 --> 00:37:00,073
You know, l'll come by
and l'll help you decorate.

690
00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:02,873
- You know what that means.
- Shut up!

691
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,958
Might as well use this psycho killer
as an excuse.

692
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:09,795
Go ahead...

693
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:11,638
Blonde me.

694
00:37:17,080 --> 00:37:19,913
You did a good job.
l could dig it, you know?

695
00:37:20,040 --> 00:37:22,998
Maybe l can be an interior decorator.

696
00:37:23,120 --> 00:37:25,270
You could be whatever you want, l think.

697
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:27,356
(coughs)

698
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:28,833
Sure.

699
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:31,110
- Yeah.
- What, you really mean that?

700
00:37:31,240 --> 00:37:32,878
Of course l mean that.

701
00:37:36,040 --> 00:37:37,393
l don't know.

702
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:41,232
l figure,
you're born into a slot, you know,...

703
00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:43,510
- ..and that's life.
- Ruby, come on.

704
00:37:43,640 --> 00:37:45,870
You gotta stop with those negative vibes.

705
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:49,470
Hang around with those spirit snipers
and they steal your light.

706
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:53,479
- You're too young for that.
- Uh-huh.

707
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:01,436
(Ritchie) What are you doing?

708
00:38:08,120 --> 00:38:11,032
Hey, come on. Come on, come on.
You don't gotta do that.

709
00:38:11,160 --> 00:38:13,913
- (Ruby mumbles)
- Ruby, Ruby, stop, please.

710
00:38:14,040 --> 00:38:15,996
You don't gotta do that. Don't do it.

711
00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:26,317
Where you goin'?

712
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:28,396
l'm gonna go.

713
00:38:28,520 --> 00:38:31,910
- l didn't say to go.
- You didn't exactly say to stay.

714
00:38:32,040 --> 00:38:33,996
Stay.

715
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:36,996
(Ruby hums)

716
00:38:38,840 --> 00:38:40,796
lt's good.

717
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:47,319
(Vinny) Hi, baby. How ya doin'?
l'm sorry...

718
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:49,396
Yeah, l'll be home...

719
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:51,796
Yeah, l'll be an hour.

720
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:54,436
You know her. Come on.

721
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:58,519
lt's a last-minute thing. l didn't know
she was coming, OK? Calm down.

722
00:38:59,640 --> 00:39:02,837
Of course l do. Come on.
Not now, all right?

723
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:05,719
Bye. l gotta go, OK? Just...

724
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:10,437
She can't give you what you want.

725
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:12,357
Yeah, let's not talk about her, OK?

726
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:14,675
((sound) ''Best Of My Love'' by The Emotions)

727
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:23,437
(sound) l like the way you make me feel
about you, baby

728
00:39:24,080 --> 00:39:26,992
(sound) l want the whole wide world to see

729
00:39:27,120 --> 00:39:28,838
(sound) Whoa, whoa

730
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:30,871
(sound) You've got the best of my love

731
00:39:31,120 --> 00:39:32,712
(sound) Whoa, whoa

732
00:39:32,840 --> 00:39:34,910
(sound) You've got the best of my love

733
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:36,996
(sound) Whoa, whoa...

734
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:40,156
Gloria.

735
00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:44,636
l'm feeling a little guilty now.

736
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:47,635
- Now?
- Yeah, and l'm... l'm thinking...

737
00:39:48,680 --> 00:39:52,195
l'm trying to be a good husband now.
l just don't feel like we can do it.

738
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:55,790
Vinny, you're like a friggin' yo-yo,
back and forth, forth and back.

739
00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:59,117
Let's do it, let's not do it.
You know what? Let's just not do it.

740
00:39:59,240 --> 00:40:01,674
- OK? That's it.
- (mumbles)

741
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:05,156
You think you're the only one
with feelings? l got a husband at home.

742
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:07,316
l know. l agree with you absolutely.

743
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:10,193
You're a selfish bastard.
You're a selfish bastard.

744
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:12,470
You started this. l didn't start this.

745
00:40:12,600 --> 00:40:15,592
- l know it's my fault.
- Put your fuckin' clothes on.

746
00:40:15,720 --> 00:40:17,676
Clothes l put on your back.

747
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:20,996
(sound) Oh, oh-oh

748
00:40:21,120 --> 00:40:22,599
(sound) Oh

749
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:25,109
(sound) Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh...

750
00:40:25,240 --> 00:40:28,038
- Maybe we should do it one more time.
- Come on.

751
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:30,037
Oh, Vinny, stop.

752
00:40:33,880 --> 00:40:36,155
Vinny.

753
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:38,953
- Come on, beg me for it.
- Oh, come on, Vinny.

754
00:40:39,080 --> 00:40:41,435
Oh, Vinny. Come on.

755
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:44,957
(sound) You've got the best of my love

756
00:40:45,080 --> 00:40:49,198
(sound) Oh, giving you the best of my love

757
00:40:50,040 --> 00:40:53,350
With that reward money, l'd start
a college fund for my daughter.

758
00:40:53,480 --> 00:40:57,632
Yeah? l'd buy a yacht. Like Hugh Hefner,
l'd get Playboy bunnies walking around.

759
00:40:57,760 --> 00:40:59,716
You can't get a yacht with ten grand.

760
00:40:59,840 --> 00:41:02,274
You'd get a row boat
with two Puerto Rican skanks.

761
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:06,871
With that money, l'll take my parents

762
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:09,719

What'd you do, man?

769
00:41:20,920 --> 00:41:24,708
You dress like that, you don't think

Go play with your friends, OK?
Get away from him.

773
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:36,589

00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:20,075
Thank you.

787
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:23,635

You're serious you're not gonna

00:50:15,520 --> 00:50:18,273
..and from the ants
that dwell in these cracks...

913
00:50:18,400 --> 00:50:22,757
..and feed on the dried blood
that has settled into these cracks.

914
00:50:22,880 --> 00:50:24,711
Mr Breslin, sir,...

915
00:50:24,840 --> 00:50:28,389
..don't think that because
you haven't heard from me for a while...

916
00:50:28,520 --> 00:50:30,078
..that l went to sleep.

917
00:50:30,200 --> 00:50:35,433
No. Rather, l am still here,
like a spirit roaming the night.

918
00:50:35,560 --> 00:50:40,190
''Thirsty, hungry,
seldom stopping to rest,...

919
00:50:40,320 --> 00:50:43,312
..anxious to please Sam.''

920
00:50:43,440 --> 00:50:47,035
l love my work.
Now the void has been filled.

921
00:50:47,160 --> 00:50:50,550
He won't let me stop killing
until he gets his fill of blood.

922
00:50:50,880 --> 00:50:52,836
Tell me, Jim,...

923
00:50:52,960 --> 00:50:55,474
.. what will you have for me July 9th?

924
00:50:55,600 --> 00:50:58,194
Not knowing what the future holds,...

925
00:50:58,320 --> 00:51:00,038
..l shall say farewell.

926
00:51:00,160 --> 00:51:03,152
And l will see you at my nextjob.

927
00:51:03,840 --> 00:51:07,549
Or shall l say you will see
my handiwork at the nextjob?

928
00:51:07,680 --> 00:51:09,272
PS.

929
00:51:09,400 --> 00:51:14,190
Please inform all the detectives working
on the case that l wish them luck.

930
00:51:14,320 --> 00:51:16,356
Keep them digging, drive on.

931
00:51:17,040 --> 00:51:19,395
- Think positive.

the Wicked King Wicker.

934
00:51:26,920 --> 00:51:28,558

- Don't shoot!

935
00:51:28,680 --> 00:51:32,150
What are you doing here?
The Son of Sam is running around!

936
00:51:32,280 --> 00:51:34,999
Go find yourself a motel.
Get the hell out of here.

937
00:51:35,120 --> 00:51:37,315
The  Disciples of Hell.

938
00:51:37,440 --> 00:51:41,035
John Wheaties, rapist
and suffocator of young girls.

939
00:51:46,120 --> 00:51:48,475
ln their blood and from the gutter...

940
00:51:49,600 --> 00:51:52,956
..Sam's creation, .-Calibre.

941
00:51:54,040 --> 00:51:55,996
The Son of Sam.

942
00:52:12,080 --> 00:52:13,957
Let me in! Mick!

943
00:52:14,080 --> 00:52:16,036

944

What? You all right?

945
00:52:19,760 --> 00:52:23,116
The Duke of Death,
the Wicked King Wicker.

946
00:52:23,240 --> 00:52:25,196
(dog barking)

947
00:52:27,200 --> 00:52:30,715

950
00:52:36,080 --> 00:52:38,958
Honey. Honey, what are you doing?

951
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:43,992
- Honey, what's wrong?
- Baby, this is devil worship, OK?

952
00:52:44,120 --> 00:52:46,315
This is occult. This is Manson shit.

953
00:52:47,040 --> 00:52:49,076
There's somebody outside there?

954
00:52:49,200 --> 00:52:51,156
What if he thinks l saw him?

955
00:52:51,760 --> 00:52:53,876
What if he fuckin' thinks l saw him?

956
00:52:54,880 --> 00:52:57,235
- The Son of Sam?
- Yes, the fuckin' Son of Sam.

957
00:52:57,360 --> 00:52:59,555
Well, why would he think you saw him?

958
00:53:00,840 --> 00:53:02,796
Did you see him?

959
00:53:04,240 --> 00:53:06,800
Honey, you're scaring me.
Did you see him?

960
00:53:10,280 --> 00:53:12,236
Baby, l gotta get outta here.

961
00:53:12,360 --> 00:53:14,954

l'm fuckin' gonna have a nervous
breakdown. l gotta get outta here.

963
00:53:19,680 --> 00:53:23,036
Let's go away for a whole fuckin' week.
Let's just get outta here!

964
00:53:23,880 --> 00:53:25,836
When do you want to go?

965
00:53:25,960 --> 00:53:29,396
Right now. Let's pack up our shit
and get the fuck out for a while, OK?

966
00:53:29,520 --> 00:53:33,798
Baby, l can't go now. Dad told me we
might have to fire one of the waitresses.

967
00:53:33,920 --> 00:53:36,798
Oh, baby. Come on. Let's go.
Come on, we'll get a hot tub.

968
00:53:36,920 --> 00:53:41,038
We'll get dirty movies, massages,
vibratin' beds, the whole works.

969
00:53:41,160 --> 00:53:43,116
We'll just have fun, crazy fun, OK?

970
00:53:45,480 --> 00:53:47,436
We could get the dirty movies here.

971
00:53:49,960 --> 00:53:52,235
lt's not the same, baby. lt's not the same.

972
00:53:53,960 --> 00:53:55,916
l can't leave Dad right now, baby,...

973
00:53:56,040 --> 00:53:58,235
..but we can make our own vacation here.

974
00:53:58,360 --> 00:54:00,510
You'll see. We can have our own fun.

975
00:54:23,320 --> 00:54:25,117
Come on.

976
00:54:25,240 --> 00:54:27,196
Come on. Let's make love.

977
00:54:32,080 --> 00:54:34,196
Baby. Baby? Hey, baby.

978
00:54:34,320 --> 00:54:36,709
C-Could we make love with the light on?

979
00:54:37,320 --> 00:54:39,072
What?

980
00:54:39,920 --> 00:54:42,798
- l wanna see us.
- You wanna make love with the light on?

981
00:54:44,320 --> 00:54:46,231
Yeah, l wanna see us.

982
00:54:46,360 --> 00:54:48,715
Can we try it? Please?

983
00:54:56,280 --> 00:55:00,239
All right. How 'bout instead
of making love, we fuck this time, huh?

984
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:02,956
- Yeah?
- OK.

985
00:55:23,520 --> 00:55:25,476
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.

986
00:55:36,640 --> 00:55:38,198
(Vinny moans)

987
00:55:38,320 --> 00:55:39,673
Oh!

988
00:55:45,480 --> 00:55:47,232
Oh, shit.

989
00:55:48,280 --> 00:55:50,236
(Vinny sighs)

990
00:56:10,600 --> 00:56:12,875
Good night. Let's go to sleep.

991
00:56:17,680 --> 00:56:19,636
Good night, baby.

992
00:56:36,520 --> 00:56:39,193
Good evening.
This is John Jeffries, eyewitness News.

993
00:56:39,280 --> 00:56:42,033
l'm here with Detective Timothy Dowd,...

994
00:56:42,160 --> 00:56:45,152
..head of the .-Calibre Killer Task Force.

995
00:56:45,280 --> 00:56:49,717
Detective Dowd, what can you tell
our viewers about Son of Sam?

996
00:56:49,840 --> 00:56:53,992
Well, John, we are putting together
a picture of the suspect... uh, slowly.

997
00:56:54,120 --> 00:56:57,237
Too slowly for our tastes,
but this is a very elusive suspect.

998
00:56:57,360 --> 00:57:01,717
Whenever we get there, he's gone.
We never know where he'll strike next...

999
00:57:01,840 --> 00:57:03,990
What are they talking about anyway?

1000
00:57:04,120 --> 00:57:05,758
The man must live somewhere.

1001
00:57:05,880 --> 00:57:09,759
So we have a man who, we suspect...
Maybe you notice he comes home late...

1002
00:57:09,880 --> 00:57:11,916
This is... This is...

1003
00:57:12,040 --> 00:57:14,918
- This is all fuckin' smoke.
- lt's a farce. A farce.

1004
00:57:15,040 --> 00:57:19,192
..single room or an attic
or in the back of some place.

1005
00:57:19,320 --> 00:57:21,880
(Jeffries)
Do you have a long list of suspects ?

1006
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:23,877
(Dowd) We have a list.

1007
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:28,516
We've always had a list. We have a list
now, and we have always had a list.

1008
00:57:30,080 --> 00:57:32,036
You know what we gotta do.

1009
00:57:33,320 --> 00:57:36,517
We gotta get this rat bastard.
We gotta do it.

1010
00:57:36,840 --> 00:57:38,512
Cos they can't do it.

1011
00:57:38,640 --> 00:57:40,312
And maybe we, uh...

1012
00:57:40,440 --> 00:57:43,000
..offer another $, in the reward, huh?

1013
00:57:43,120 --> 00:57:46,635
- We'd get a few more names on our list.
- Right, boss.

1014
00:57:46,760 --> 00:57:48,637
(Dionna) lt's bad.

1015
00:57:48,760 --> 00:57:52,070
Yeah. They're gonna catch
this bastard soon, huh?

1016
00:57:52,200 --> 00:57:54,350
OK, do me a favour.
Buy me a little time.

1017
00:57:54,480 --> 00:57:57,472
Do the books one more time.
See if you find something.

1018
00:57:57,600 --> 00:57:59,556
Dad, it's math. lt's not magic.

1019
00:57:59,680 --> 00:58:01,636
l've been through them four times.

1020
00:58:01,760 --> 00:58:04,513
lf things don't change,
l don't know what will happen.

1021
00:58:04,640 --> 00:58:07,359
- l gotta tell Connie l gotta let her go.
- Connie?

1022
00:58:07,480 --> 00:58:09,994
She's our strongest waitress. You can't.

1023
00:58:10,120 --> 00:58:13,271
Connie's got no children.
Only one mouth has got to stay empty.

1024
00:58:13,400 --> 00:58:15,277
Hey, what's up?

1025
00:58:15,400 --> 00:58:17,516
- Hey, paesano!
- How ya doing?

1026
00:58:17,640 --> 00:58:20,837
- Where were you?
- Stadium. Yankees lost.

1027
00:58:20,960 --> 00:58:23,872
- Let's go. l'm tired.
- All right, Dad. We're gonna go.

1028
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:26,639
Aspett' one minute, OK?

1030
00:58:29,640 --> 00:58:32,029
- Oh, you do?
- Yeah. You like presents.

1031
00:58:33,640 --> 00:58:36,518
- What is this, Dad?
- (Vinny) What the hell is that?

1032
00:58:36,640 --> 00:58:39,837
lf you go out tonight, Vinny,
make her wear it.

1033
00:58:39,960 --> 00:58:43,430
Dad, l'm not gonna wear this.
We're just gonna drive straight home.

1034
00:58:43,560 --> 00:58:45,073
Do me a favour. For your father.

1035
00:58:45,200 --> 00:58:48,033
This animal is killing young girls
with long, brown hair.

1036
00:58:48,160 --> 00:58:50,116
Please, you do it for me.

1037
00:58:51,440 --> 00:58:54,238
- Listen to your father
- Are you gonna gang up on me?

1038
00:58:54,360 --> 00:58:57,238
- Yeah.
- All right. l'll wear the Barbie doll... thing.

1039
00:58:57,360 --> 00:58:59,635
You make me sleep in peace.
Please? Thank you.

1040
00:58:59,760 --> 00:59:01,113
(Vinny) Let's go.

1041
00:59:01,240 --> 00:59:03,117
- (Dionna) Are they closed?
- Yeah.

1042
00:59:03,240 --> 00:59:05,196
- Promise?
- l swear to God.

1043
00:59:05,320 --> 00:59:08,676
((sound) ''lt's Ecstasy When You Lay Down

You look so different.

1050
00:59:28,200 --> 00:59:30,953
Jesus, l feel like
l'm cheating on you with you.

1051
00:59:32,960 --> 00:59:35,918
Wow. Wow, baby.

1052

Sheri, do you want to fuck?
Want to fuck me, Sheri?

- Do you want to fuck me?
- Yeah, l do. Can l call you Vincente?

1058
00:59:54,280 --> 00:59:58,558
Yeah, but first you have

1059
00:59:58,680 --> 01:00:01,240
You sure you want me to do that,
Vincente?

1060
01:00:01,360 --> 01:00:02,998
(laughs)

1061
01:00:03,120 --> 01:00:05,190
l know Sheri loves it... Whoa, baby!

1062
01:00:07,240 --> 01:00:09,754

1063

1095
01:01:59,280 --> 01:02:01,316
You see that guy over there making pies?

01:09:53,640 --> 01:09:56,279
Commitment, responsibility,
marriage, kids.

1214
01:09:56,400 --> 01:09:58,436
You're not gonna marry her.
l won't let you.

1215
01:09:58,560 --> 01:10:00,471
You and Dionna are gonna have kids?

1216
01:10:00,600 --> 01:10:04,149
What took you so long, Chickie?

1219
01:10:11,560 --> 01:10:14,028
Well, can you get me a BLT?
Something like that...

1220
01:10:14,160 --> 01:10:17,470

You got a -hour diner,

You're not gonna serve me?

1226
01:10:33,200 --> 01:10:35,760
You're lucky l come into

- Wait, wait. Hold on.
- You talking to me?

1229
01:10:41,200 --> 01:10:43,236
Hold on. Chickie,

1230
01:10:43,360 --> 01:10:45,237
- Who?
- You don't know who this is, do you?

1231
01:10:45,360 --> 01:10:46,588
This is Ritchie!

1232
01:10:46,720 --> 01:10:48,517

1233
01:10:48,640 --> 01:10:51,996

1234

1238
01:11:02,960 --> 01:11:04,916
Fuck this idiot. Fuck him. Let's go.

1239
01:11:05,040 --> 01:11:07,554
- You're calling me an idiot?
- Yeah, a fuckin' idiot.

1240
01:11:07,680 --> 01:11:09,432

1242
01:11:12,680 --> 01:11:14,352
Fuck you!

01:11:15,240 --> 01:11:17,151
You fucking bitch!

(man) Jesus.

1245
01:11:19,040 --> 01:11:21,873
Tastes better than Heinz ketchup,

1246
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:24,719
- He's fuckin' nuts.
- You like that, you fuck?

1247
01:11:24,840 --> 01:11:26,193
Ritchie, easy.

1248
01:11:36,640 --> 01:11:39,473
You know, Ritchie,
l don't blame them, you know?

1249
01:11:40,960 --> 01:11:43,155
When you're in Rome...
What are you gonna do?

1250
01:11:43,280 --> 01:11:45,396
You come up here
with that dog collar...

1251
01:11:45,520 --> 01:11:49,195
We're all wearing dog collars.
You're wearin' a dog collar.

1252
01:11:49,320 --> 01:11:51,754
- l'm wearing a...
- You're wearing a dog collar.

1253
01:11:51,880 --> 01:11:56,317
You're a fuckin' dog of society. You're
on a leash to a certain way of thinking.

1254
01:11:56,440 --> 01:11:58,829
l don't fuckin' understand
what you're saying.

1255
01:11:58,960 --> 01:12:02,236
l'm not relating to this shit.
ls the fuckin' heat getting to you?

1256
01:12:02,360 --> 01:12:04,032
No, no. Listen.

1257
01:12:05,560 --> 01:12:08,393
lt's like everybody's got
two personalities, Vin.

1258
01:12:08,520 --> 01:12:12,672
Two personalities. One you're born with,
one the fuckin' world gives you.

1259
01:12:12,800 --> 01:12:15,360
Are you talking about
some alter ego shit?

1260
01:12:15,480 --> 01:12:16,708
Ah, no. Vin...

1261
01:12:16,840 --> 01:12:19,434
lt's like... l got these things l like doin'.

1262
01:12:20,800 --> 01:12:23,758
l like doin' 'em so much,
it's like l have to do 'em.

1263
01:12:25,040 --> 01:12:26,996
Now, do l really like doin' 'em,...

1264
01:12:27,120 --> 01:12:30,237
..or was l preprogrammed at an early age
to respond to liking them?

1265
01:12:30,360 --> 01:12:32,271
That's what l'm talking about.

1266
01:12:32,400 --> 01:12:34,356
You fuckin' lost me.

1267
01:12:34,480 --> 01:12:36,596
Yeah, fuckin' what else is new, man?

1268
01:12:40,240 --> 01:12:44,518
What the fuck? Are you saying
that if l fuckin' cheat on Dionna,...

1269
01:12:44,640 --> 01:12:48,235
..it's not me that made me do it,
it's the fuckin' world?

1270
01:12:48,360 --> 01:12:50,316
Take responsibility for yourself, man.

1271
01:12:50,440 --> 01:12:52,396
lt's not the fuckin' world.

1272
01:12:52,520 --> 01:12:56,274
lt's your fuckin' dick that made you
do that! Don't blame the world!

1273
01:12:56,400 --> 01:12:58,789
- My dick made me do that?
- Yeah, your dick.

1274
01:13:03,600 --> 01:13:05,716
(TV) The heat wave continues in the city...

1275
01:13:05,840 --> 01:13:08,718
..as record-breaking temperatures
claimed six lives.

1276
01:13:08,840 --> 01:13:11,115
Three fatalities were in Brooklyn,...

1277
01:13:11,240 --> 01:13:13,390
..two in the Bronx and one in Queens.

1278
01:13:13,520 --> 01:13:15,556
Crime has risen with the temperatures.

1279
01:13:15,680 --> 01:13:17,875
There is an increase
in domestic violence...

1280
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:19,718
All right, you two. Out. My turn.

1281
01:13:19,840 --> 01:13:24,391
And Con Ed is asking that you
try to conserve electricity,...

1282
01:13:24,520 --> 01:13:27,159
..as several neighbourhoods
in the five boroughs...

1283
01:13:27,280 --> 01:13:29,635
..are experiencing brownouts.

1284
01:13:29,760 --> 01:13:32,797
The health department
advises the elderly...

1285
01:13:32,920 --> 01:13:34,876
..and people with respiratory problems...

1286
01:13:35,840 --> 01:13:37,796
Uh-oh.

1287
01:13:43,480 --> 01:13:45,038
Shit.

1288
01:13:45,160 --> 01:13:46,513
- (frantic knocking)
- (Dionna) Daddy! Dad!

1289
01:13:46,640 --> 01:13:48,596
(Dionna screams)

1290
01:13:48,720 --> 01:13:52,235
- (Vinny) Take it easy, baby. Come on.
- lt's all right.

1291
01:13:52,360 --> 01:13:54,954
Oh, my God! Guys, this is not funny!

1292
01:13:55,080 --> 01:13:58,197
- lt's us. Baby, the power's out.
- The power's out?

1293
01:13:58,320 --> 01:14:00,276
th Precinct, Officer Hall.

1294
01:14:01,280 --> 01:14:04,636
Yeah, we do know. lt's a blackout.
The whole five boroughs.

1295
01:14:04,760 --> 01:14:07,433
- We're doing the best we can.
- (phones ringing)

1296
01:14:08,800 --> 01:14:11,792
 Precinct, Officer Riggs. Yes, sir.

1297
01:14:11,920 --> 01:14:14,070
We understand that the lights are out.

1298
01:14:14,200 --> 01:14:16,156
We have Con edison out in full force.

1299
01:14:16,280 --> 01:14:20,034
Con ed don't know nothin',
but what l know is...

1300
01:14:20,160 --> 01:14:22,151
..we can't expect any help from the cops.

1301
01:14:22,280 --> 01:14:25,272
(Luigi) They'll have their hands full
chasin' looters.

1302
01:14:25,400 --> 01:14:27,356
(Joey) Niggers and spics.

1303
01:14:27,480 --> 01:14:30,278
(Luigi)
lt's ourjob to protect our neighbourhood.

1304
01:14:30,400 --> 01:14:32,994
And this Son of Sam
has the blackout to hide in.

1305
01:14:33,720 --> 01:14:36,314
l want all our guys
on the Layton Avenue bridge.

1306
01:14:37,760 --> 01:14:40,957
lt's fuckin' my joint. Shut the fuck up.

1307
01:14:41,080 --> 01:14:44,038
Nobody gets in my neighbourhood
without me knowin' it.

1308
01:14:44,160 --> 01:14:46,355
Oh, what the fuck is this?

1309
01:14:48,640 --> 01:14:49,914
Pull over!

1310
01:14:50,040 --> 01:14:53,191
What the fuck are you doing?
Who are you? What do you want here?

1311
01:14:53,320 --> 01:14:55,038
No sè dònde estoy...

1312
01:14:55,160 --> 01:14:57,435
- What the fuck are you talking about?
- No puedo ver...

1313
01:14:57,560 --> 01:15:00,074
Get the fuck out of there!

1314
01:15:01,120 --> 01:15:03,111
(tyres screeching)

1315
01:15:07,080 --> 01:15:09,275
Con Ed officials said...

1316
01:15:09,400 --> 01:15:12,039
..the lights went out at 9.pm!

1317
01:15:12,160 --> 01:15:16,278
l'm here at the corner
of 15th Street and 5th Avenue.

1318
01:15:17,280 --> 01:15:19,316
And black and Puerto Rican people...

1319
01:15:19,440 --> 01:15:21,158
..are going crazy.

1320
01:15:21,280 --> 01:15:23,748
As l overheard one man say,...

1321
01:15:23,880 --> 01:15:27,236
.. ''lt's like Christmas in July. ''
That's a quote.

1322
01:15:30,440 --> 01:15:33,398
We have reports that people
are stuck on the subways...

1323
01:15:33,520 --> 01:15:38,753
..and that the city that never sleeps
has come to a standstill.

1324
01:15:38,880 --> 01:15:42,839
l'm gonna get out of the way...
cos l fear my safety.

1325
01:15:42,960 --> 01:15:46,032
Joey, get the kids in the neighbourhood.

1326
01:15:46,160 --> 01:15:48,151
lf they need cars, you give 'em cars.

1327
01:15:48,280 --> 01:15:50,840
lf they need baseball bats,
you give 'em bats.

1328
01:15:50,960 --> 01:15:53,155
We're gonna patrol the neighbourhood.

1329
01:15:53,280 --> 01:15:56,716
We'll go to different points -
the beach, bridge, down to the avenue.

1330
01:15:56,840 --> 01:15:58,273
- Understand?
- (all) Yeah.

1331
01:15:58,400 --> 01:15:59,799
(shouting)

1332
01:15:59,920 --> 01:16:01,956
Here we go. Come on. Let's go.

1333
01:16:10,720 --> 01:16:14,235
(chanting) We'll get you, Son of Sam!
We'll get you, Son of Sam!

1334
01:16:21,760 --> 01:16:23,716
And then you call Frankie.

1335
01:16:23,840 --> 01:16:25,990
Tell him to bring the feast lights...

1336
01:16:26,120 --> 01:16:30,079
..and the generators cos Luigi
is gonna give a big block party...

1337
01:16:30,240 --> 01:16:32,276
.. with the cannoli and the babà rum...

1338
01:16:32,400 --> 01:16:35,119
..and the sausage and peppers
and the spiedini.

1339
01:16:35,240 --> 01:16:38,550
That psycho is gonna have
no place to hide.

1340
01:16:38,680 --> 01:16:40,113
Frankie!

1341
01:16:44,120 --> 01:16:46,429
Hey, hey, hey, that's my man!

1342

01:16:59,840 --> 01:17:02,957
- We got a fuckin' gig. You know, singin'?
- Serious?

1347
01:17:03,080 --> 01:17:05,753
- We're going to fuckin' CBGB's.
- At CBGB's.

1348
01:17:05,880 --> 01:17:09,111
Vinny, this is our first gig, man.
This is a big deal.

1349
01:17:09,240 --> 01:17:12,038
No, congratula...
No, l'm serious. We're excited.

1350
01:17:12,160 --> 01:17:13,912
Congratulations. A toast.

1351
01:17:14,040 --> 01:17:16,713
- l'm singing.
- They're gonna pay you. That's great.

1352
01:17:16,840 --> 01:17:18,637
l don't know about that.

1353
01:17:18,760 --> 01:17:21,558
Maybe l'll come.
How do you spell that CBGB?

1354
01:17:21,680 --> 01:17:25,798
C-B-G-B. You never heard of it?
lt's on the Bowery in the city.

1355
01:17:25,920 --> 01:17:27,831
Oh, CBGB.

1356
01:17:27,960 --> 01:17:30,952
You and Ritchie
seem really happy together.

1357
01:17:31,080 --> 01:17:35,835
Yep, we are. Just try and enjoy it
while it lasts. You know what l mean?

1358
01:17:35,960 --> 01:17:39,316
l guess that's a good philosophy
as long as you're not married.

1359
01:17:41,240 --> 01:17:43,196
Listen, um...

1360
01:17:43,680 --> 01:17:46,240
l know that you've been
with Vinny before.

1361
01:17:46,360 --> 01:17:48,590
l mean, it's not a secret or anything.

1362
01:17:51,400 --> 01:17:53,356
That was a long time ago.

1363
01:17:53,480 --> 01:17:57,632
A long time ago, before you two got
together, let alone got married, all right?

1364
01:17:57,760 --> 01:17:59,876
No, no, no, no. l know that. l know that.

1365
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:02,230
l'm not accusing you of anything.

1366
01:18:02,360 --> 01:18:03,918
Then what do you want?

1367
01:18:04,040 --> 01:18:06,395
All l... wanted to say was that...

1368
01:18:06,520 --> 01:18:08,715
..since you've been with him,...

1369
01:18:08,840 --> 01:18:11,195
..maybe you could tell me what he likes.

1370
01:18:11,320 --> 01:18:14,392
- You're serious?
- Yeah.

1371
01:18:14,520 --> 01:18:16,875
lf l knew, l wouldn't be asking.

1372
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:20,117
l mean... Look.
You think this is easy for me?

1373
01:18:20,240 --> 01:18:22,595
Talking to you about Vinny, you know,...

1374
01:18:22,720 --> 01:18:25,518
..my husband's sexual likes and dislikes.

1375
01:18:26,560 --> 01:18:29,358
And so you ask me, cos l should know.

1376
01:18:32,680 --> 01:18:34,318
No...

1377
01:18:34,440 --> 01:18:37,113
You guys looked happy
when you were goin' out.

1378
01:18:37,240 --> 01:18:39,993
And you're so sexy and confident
and everything.

1379
01:18:41,120 --> 01:18:43,076
Listen. l mean,...

1380
01:18:43,200 --> 01:18:45,270
..sometimes l-l think that, um,...

1381
01:18:45,400 --> 01:18:48,198
..that, you know, he's cheating on me.

1382
01:18:52,360 --> 01:18:55,716
Anyway, you know,
l wa... l wanna please him,...

1383
01:18:55,840 --> 01:18:58,070
..but l, l don't think that l do.

1384
01:19:00,160 --> 01:19:02,151
You have any advice? Anything?

1385
01:19:02,280 --> 01:19:06,478
Look, Dionna.
You are... very pretty, OK?

1386
01:19:07,480 --> 01:19:09,436
You're sexy.

1387
01:19:11,680 --> 01:19:14,274
l happen to know
that Vinny loves you very much.

1388
01:19:15,760 --> 01:19:17,876
l know he loves me but, um...

1389
01:19:19,120 --> 01:19:21,111
..l think l disappoint him.

1390
01:19:21,240 --> 01:19:23,151
So what do you want me to do?

1391
01:19:23,280 --> 01:19:26,158
Do you want me to tell you
how to fuck your husband?

1392
01:19:30,640 --> 01:19:33,279
Yeah, fine. l'll tell ya.

1393
01:19:36,960 --> 01:19:38,951
First...

1394
01:19:39,080 --> 01:19:41,036
..you can't be his wife.

1395
01:19:41,960 --> 01:19:45,236
- That's number one. Too late for that.
- Yeah.

1396
01:20:03,480 --> 01:20:06,278
ls this it? This where we're going?

1397
01:20:06,400 --> 01:20:10,598
The sign's CBGB, right? And this
is the corner of Bleecker and Bowery.

1398
01:20:10,720 --> 01:20:14,076
This is where my father said all the bums
were. But who are these people?

1399
01:20:14,360 --> 01:20:16,669
You scared?

1400
01:20:16,800 --> 01:20:18,119
What is this?

1401
01:20:18,240 --> 01:20:20,708
l can't believe Ritchie
made us come over here.

1402
01:20:20,840 --> 01:20:23,559
l won't even park my car here.
What the fuck is this?

1403
01:20:23,680 --> 01:20:26,035
Oh, my God.
Look at those girls looking at me.

1404
01:20:26,160 --> 01:20:29,630
- Looking at me like l'm the freak.
- Just don't pay attention to them.

1405
01:20:29,760 --> 01:20:33,548
Look at that thing on her tongue.
l-l don't like this place.

1406
01:20:33,680 --> 01:20:36,240
- l think maybe we should go.
- You think so?

1407
01:20:36,360 --> 01:20:39,511
You think that's right, though, huh?

1408
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:41,831
Maybe we should say hello to Ritchie.

1409
01:20:41,960 --> 01:20:45,748
Maybe go for one drink
and then get the hell out, huh?

1410
01:20:45,880 --> 01:20:48,314
- Your call.

1413

OK. All right.

1414
01:20:57,120 --> 01:20:59,793
- Um...

1415
01:20:59,920 --> 01:21:01,876

01:35:14,760 --> 01:35:15,670
All right.

1663
01:35:15,800 --> 01:35:17,199
Gentlemen, good morning.

1664
01:35:17,320 --> 01:35:19,390
Gentlemen!

1665
01:35:19,520 --> 01:35:22,478
Congratulations.
Death Day went without an incident.

1666
01:35:22,600 --> 01:35:24,318
Now l need you to stay sharp.

1667
01:35:24,440 --> 01:35:27,637
l want you to pay attention
to every detail, big or small.

1668
01:35:27,760 --> 01:35:30,194
We're close. He knows we're close.

1669
01:35:30,320 --> 01:35:32,629
This sick bastard,
he knows we're onto him.

1670
01:35:32,760 --> 01:35:36,230
- We're close. He knows we're out there.
- everybody's checking out.

1671
01:35:36,360 --> 01:35:37,634
Chickie, give me a fork.

1672
01:35:37,760 --> 01:35:39,239
Hey, Vinny.

1673
01:35:39,360 --> 01:35:41,555
You're 86'd, you and your freaky friend.

1674
01:35:41,680 --> 01:35:45,229
- Chickie, relax, man.
- What happened?

1675
01:35:45,760 --> 01:35:47,876
You didn't tell them what happened?

1676
01:35:48,000 --> 01:35:50,355
That freaky bastard
scared my customers.

1677
01:35:50,480 --> 01:35:52,436
They thought he was the Son of Sam.

1678
01:35:52,560 --> 01:35:54,118
- Who? Who?
- Fuckin' Ritchie.

1679
01:35:54,240 --> 01:35:56,674
l never seen nothin' like it,
not even in Nam.

1680
01:35:56,800 --> 01:35:58,472
He's fuckin' exaggeratin'.

1681
01:35:58,600 --> 01:36:01,353
The kid was there lookin' like
Night Of The Living Dead.

1682
01:36:01,560 --> 01:36:04,154
My customers get nervous
just from lookin' at him.

1683
01:36:04,280 --> 01:36:06,350
So l go over and l ask him very nice...

1684
01:36:06,480 --> 01:36:10,029
Come on! lt didn't happen like that.
Why are you fuckin' makin' it up?

1685
01:36:10,160 --> 01:36:12,833
- lt didn't happen like that?
- No, it fuckin' didn't!

1686
01:36:12,960 --> 01:36:15,997
He didn't jump up like a madman,
break a glass over his head...

1687
01:36:16,120 --> 01:36:19,032
..and start licking the blood
like fuckin' Bela Lugosi?

1688
01:36:19,160 --> 01:36:21,151
l never seen nothin' like it.

1689
01:36:21,280 --> 01:36:24,829
That kid scared the shit out
of everybody in the fuckin' place.

1690
01:36:24,960 --> 01:36:27,076
Didn't happen like... You know what?

1691
01:36:27,200 --> 01:36:29,395
l'll serve you guys, but not you, Vince.

1692
01:36:29,520 --> 01:36:33,399
- And not that fuckin' ghoul. He's 86'd.
- Like l fuckin' care. 86 me, too.

1693
01:36:33,520 --> 01:36:35,875
You're 86'd cos it didn't happen like that.

1694
01:36:36,000 --> 01:36:38,309
You're so fuckin' crazy. You're fucked up.

1695
01:36:38,440 --> 01:36:41,637
Vinny, Ritchie does somethin' like that
and you don't tell us?

1696
01:36:41,760 --> 01:36:44,433
- Come on. Are you shitting me?
- What do you mean?

1697
01:36:44,560 --> 01:36:47,028
You're not gonna take
that shit for serious.

1698
01:36:47,160 --> 01:36:49,151
What does Chickie gotta lie for?

1699
01:36:49,280 --> 01:36:51,794
- Anything else we should know?
- You hiding something?

1700
01:36:51,920 --> 01:36:54,798
- What the fuck does that mean?
- You didn't tell us about this.

1701
01:36:54,920 --> 01:36:56,876
What are you protecting Ritchie for?

1702
01:36:57,000 --> 01:37:00,549
- What else ain't you telling us?
- Don't fuckin' touch me like that!

1703
01:37:00,680 --> 01:37:04,195
- What's the matter with you?
- l'm goin' before something happens.

1704
01:37:04,320 --> 01:37:06,470
- What's wrong with you?
- Vinny, come on.

1705
01:37:06,600 --> 01:37:07,953
What's the matter with you?

1706
01:37:08,080 --> 01:37:10,435
- Hey, Vinny!
- He's protectin' him.

1707
01:37:10,560 --> 01:37:13,199
- This guy's out of line.
- He's protectin' Ritchie.

1708
01:37:13,320 --> 01:37:16,232
- That fuckin' Ritchie, man.
- He's got him brainwashed.

1709
01:37:16,360 --> 01:37:18,635
l'm telling you.
He must have something on him.

1710
01:37:18,760 --> 01:37:20,716
Vinny, come back in here!

1711
01:37:20,840 --> 01:37:22,956
What's up with this attitude on this kid?

1712
01:37:23,080 --> 01:37:26,516
Hey, leave him alone. lt ain't him.

1713
01:37:26,640 --> 01:37:28,596
(cheering)

1714
01:37:28,720 --> 01:37:30,676
((sound) disco music)

1715
01:37:31,240 --> 01:37:33,310
(sound) Let's all chant...

1716
01:37:33,440 --> 01:37:35,396
So where do you know Ritchie from?

1717
01:37:35,520 --> 01:37:37,954
Don't worry. You don't have to be jealous.

1718
01:37:38,080 --> 01:37:40,435
l knew him long before l ever met you.

1719
01:37:40,560 --> 01:37:42,630
l just didn't know he did porno.

1720
01:37:42,760 --> 01:37:44,716
- Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.
- (knock at door)

1721
01:37:44,840 --> 01:37:48,230
You gonna play my Dead Boys?
Don't make me dance to this disco shit.

1722
01:37:48,360 --> 01:37:52,592
Hello, Ritchie. Mr Macho Man, tough
Bronx boy. What are you doing here?

1723
01:37:52,720 --> 01:37:55,792
- Shut the fuck up or l'll fuckin' kill you!
- Midnite!

1724
01:37:55,920 --> 01:37:57,990
Don't touch Bobby!
Get your hands off him!

1725
01:37:58,120 --> 01:38:00,236
l'll tell your fuckin' mother what you do!

1726
01:38:00,360 --> 01:38:02,794
Get your hands off him!
l'll fire your ass!

1727
01:38:02,920 --> 01:38:05,434
(man) M-U...

1728
01:38:06,760 --> 01:38:09,638
..R-D...

1729
01:38:10,120 --> 01:38:13,112
..E-R.

1730
01:38:13,240 --> 01:38:14,832
Murder.

1731
01:38:14,960 --> 01:38:17,758
(radio commentator)
Welcome to another ballgame...

1732
01:38:17,880 --> 01:38:20,678
.. with the Yankees and the Orioles
at Yankee Stadium.

1733
01:38:20,800 --> 01:38:24,839
l know everybody's been complaining
about the heat, and it has been brutal.

1734
01:38:25,680 --> 01:38:27,557
So we've got the peftect setting...

1735
01:38:27,680 --> 01:38:31,798
..for a ballgame, and it's gonna be
a very exciting game, as it usually is,...

1736
01:38:31,920 --> 01:38:35,356
..and especially
with Scotty McGregor and Ron Guidry.

1737
01:38:35,480 --> 01:38:37,516
Guidry has more stuff than McGregor,...

1738
01:38:37,640 --> 01:38:41,997
..but McGregor gives the Yankees a hard
time when he's pitching, as he is today.

1739
01:38:42,120 --> 01:38:45,749
Coming to the plate, Reggie Jackson,
who's been struggling as of late.

1740
01:38:45,880 --> 01:38:48,348
Reggie steps into the batter's box,...

1741
01:38:48,480 --> 01:38:51,199
..taps the plate,
and he does look determined.

1742
01:38:51,320 --> 01:38:55,029
So Scotty McGregor steps off the mound,
gets back on.

1743
01:38:55,160 --> 01:38:58,118
Here's the pitch.
Strike one for number .

1744
01:38:58,240 --> 01:39:01,596
Reggie has had a lot ofproblems
with Billy Martin all year.

1745
01:39:01,720 --> 01:39:06,077
He's in Martin's doghouse. Martin yells
at him but Reggie doesn't look at him.

1746
01:39:06,200 --> 01:39:08,919
They've had their problems,
but they get over it...

1747
01:39:09,040 --> 01:39:10,598
(dog barking)

1748
01:39:10,720 --> 01:39:12,597
Reggie steps back into the box.

1749
01:39:12,720 --> 01:39:14,073
Here's the pitch...

1750
01:39:14,200 --> 01:39:15,872
(woman screams)

1751
01:39:17,040 --> 01:39:20,476
Reggie looks for the sign
from third base coach Dick Howser...

1752
01:39:20,600 --> 01:39:25,116
..then steps back into the box,
and number  is ready...

1753
01:39:25,240 --> 01:39:27,231
Help!

1754
01:39:27,360 --> 01:39:30,272
Reggie swings,
hits a foul ball back into the seats.

1755
01:39:30,400 --> 01:39:32,470
And it looks like he split that bat...

1756
01:39:32,600 --> 01:39:35,114
..and he's gotta walk back
and get another bat.

1757
01:39:35,240 --> 01:39:38,835
While he's doing that, you know
what's happening in New York lately.

1758
01:39:38,960 --> 01:39:42,350
Abe Beame, who was my teacher
in Richmond Hill High School,...

1759
01:39:42,480 --> 01:39:46,268
..the mayor of New York,
is really having his problems with the...

1760
01:39:46,400 --> 01:39:49,119
..the Son of Sam's murders
that are happening...

1761
01:39:49,240 --> 01:39:51,117
..up in the Bronx, by the way.

1762
01:39:51,240 --> 01:39:55,233
l want all you people to be careful when
you go out for a little spooning at night.

1763
01:39:55,360 --> 01:39:57,396
All right, back to the ballgame.

1764
01:39:57,520 --> 01:39:59,590
The Yankees have been in a slump lately.

1765
01:39:59,720 --> 01:40:04,271
Reggie needs one of those long balls
to get them out of it if he possibly can.

1766
01:40:05,280 --> 01:40:08,716
Reggie steps back into the box.
Got the new bat, don't forget.

1767
01:40:08,840 --> 01:40:11,229
And McGregor checks
the sign from home plate.

1768
01:40:11,360 --> 01:40:13,999
Here's the pitch. lnto the swing...

1769
01:40:14,120 --> 01:40:16,236
A long fly ball! Holy cow! That is gone!

1770
01:40:16,360 --> 01:40:18,032
(crowd cheering)

1771
01:40:18,160 --> 01:40:21,311
..to tie the Orioles two apiece
in the bottom of the fifth inning.

1772
01:40:21,440 --> 01:40:25,353
Reggie Jackson, who gets those
clutch home runs when you need 'em,...

1773
01:40:25,480 --> 01:40:27,198
..sure came through that time.

1774
01:40:27,320 --> 01:40:29,754
Holy cow! Unbelievable!

1775
01:40:29,880 --> 01:40:32,235
Over to Eyewitness reporter
John Jeffries,...

1776
01:40:32,360 --> 01:40:34,112
.. who has been covering this story.

1777
01:40:34,240 --> 01:40:37,630
Son of Sam struck last night
in Brooklyn for the first time.

1778
01:40:37,760 --> 01:40:42,356
l'm here in the predominantly black
neighbourhood of Bedford-Stuyvesant...

1779
01:40:42,480 --> 01:40:45,631
..in Brooklyn, New York,
to get a darker perspective.

1780
01:40:47,320 --> 01:40:48,912
- Ma'am.
- Yes?

1781
01:40:49,040 --> 01:40:52,589
l'm just hoping that they get him quick.
l don't care.

1782
01:40:52,720 --> 01:40:54,312
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1783
01:40:54,440 --> 01:40:56,317
lt's terrible. Bad for Brooklyn,...

1784
01:40:56,440 --> 01:40:59,750
..bad for New York, bad for America
and bad for the world.

1785
01:40:59,880 --> 01:41:01,313
Thank you, sir.

1786
01:41:01,440 --> 01:41:02,998
- Your view.
- Let me tell you.

1787
01:41:03,120 --> 01:41:06,556
Son of Sam knows better than to
come into Bed-Stuy with that crap.

1788
01:41:06,680 --> 01:41:10,832
Cos we don't care. He's not that crazy.
l would love to beat him down right now.

1789
01:41:10,960 --> 01:41:15,192
He would wish he was dead. l'd just
love to catch him right here in Bed-Stuy.

1790
01:41:15,320 --> 01:41:16,594
Thank you.

1791
01:41:16,720 --> 01:41:20,269
Exactly. Hello.
My name is Cassandra Buchanan.

1792
01:41:20,400 --> 01:41:23,392
l live there at 85 Crown Street...

1793
01:41:23,520 --> 01:41:28,196
..and l am going to give you
your darker perspective.

1794
01:41:28,320 --> 01:41:31,630
The darker perspective is:...

1795
01:41:31,760 --> 01:41:36,151
..l thank God, l thank God, l thank God...

1796
01:41:36,280 --> 01:41:41,718
..that it is a white man
that kills all of those white people.

1797
01:41:41,840 --> 01:41:45,515
Because if it were a black man...

1798
01:41:45,640 --> 01:41:49,030
.. who kills all of those white people,...

1799
01:41:49,160 --> 01:41:52,596
..there would be the biggest race riot...

1800
01:41:52,720 --> 01:41:56,315
..right here in New York City.

1801
01:41:56,440 --> 01:41:58,396
And l'd like to say one thing.

1802
01:41:58,520 --> 01:42:01,318
l am surprised that you are
in the black community.

1803
01:42:01,440 --> 01:42:04,113
- l didn't think you liked black people.
- (chuckling)

1804
01:42:04,240 --> 01:42:07,038
John Jeffries here...

1805
01:42:07,160 --> 01:42:11,517
..in the Bedford-Stuyvesant section
of Brooklyn, New York.

1806
01:42:11,640 --> 01:42:12,595
Thank you, John.

1807
01:42:16,880 --> 01:42:19,394
He's crazy. He's crazy.
He had this look in his eyes.

1808
01:42:19,520 --> 01:42:22,159
He said he was gonna kill me.
You have to help me, Joey.

1809
01:42:22,320 --> 01:42:24,834
Don't worry, Bobby.
Nobody's gonna hurt you.

1810
01:42:24,960 --> 01:42:27,076
- lt's a good thing you came to me.
- OK.

1811
01:42:28,960 --> 01:42:31,997
- Hey, Vinny, you seen Ritchie?
- Nah, not me.

1812
01:42:32,680 --> 01:42:35,752
He's the only guy on the list
we can't account for last night.

1813
01:42:35,880 --> 01:42:37,836
Where's this club, CBGB's?

1814
01:42:37,960 --> 01:42:40,110
Are you still with that shit? Huh?

1815
01:42:40,240 --> 01:42:41,958
How can you guys follow this clown?

1816
01:42:42,240 --> 01:42:44,310
lt's like the blind leading the blind.

1817
01:42:44,440 --> 01:42:46,431
Who's blind? They think for themselves.

1818
01:42:46,560 --> 01:42:47,834
l got my own mind.

1819
01:42:47,960 --> 01:42:50,474
- My head's screwed on straight.
- Yeah, exactly.

1820
01:42:50,600 --> 01:42:54,309
Let me tell you something. l know
Ritchie like if he was my brother, OK?

1821
01:42:54,440 --> 01:42:57,113
even though he was outside
the disco before the killing?

1822
01:42:57,240 --> 01:43:00,676
- especially.
- Where was he during all the killings?

1823
01:43:00,800 --> 01:43:04,156
And he fits the police profile.
He's got weird religious beliefs.

1824
01:43:04,280 --> 01:43:08,068
That shit he pulled at the diner don't
mean nothin'? You know him that well?

1825
01:43:08,200 --> 01:43:10,236
- l know him that well.
- Tell him, Bobby.

1826
01:43:10,360 --> 01:43:13,830
Tell him about the fag strip joint.
Who the star attraction was.

1827
01:43:13,960 --> 01:43:16,315
What the fuck are you talkin' about?
Come on!

1828
01:43:16,440 --> 01:43:18,908
Ritchie's a dancer at Male World.

1829
01:43:19,040 --> 01:43:21,918
A friend of mine works there.
He also does porno flicks.

1830
01:43:22,040 --> 01:43:24,190
Did you know that about your friend?

1831
01:43:24,320 --> 01:43:26,470
What else don't you know
about this pervert?

1832
01:43:26,600 --> 01:43:30,195
Doesn't make him the Son of Sam
just cos of that. Come on!

1833
01:43:30,320 --> 01:43:33,278
Killer, fag, pimp, punk rocker.

1834
01:43:33,400 --> 01:43:37,188
Queer, pervert, homo, degenerate,
whatever the fuck it is.

1835
01:43:37,320 --> 01:43:40,198
Who wants something like that
around here anyway?

1836
01:43:40,320 --> 01:43:43,790
He's your friend. Don't you wanna
know what's goin' on with him?

1837
01:43:43,920 --> 01:43:46,480
l do. When he calls
l'm gonna fuckin' talk to him.

1838
01:43:46,600 --> 01:43:49,990
You're gonna fuckin' talk to him?
You ain't thinkin' straight.

1839
01:43:50,120 --> 01:43:52,793
People are gettin' killed
in our neighbourhood.

1840
01:43:52,920 --> 01:43:54,876
Now, are you with us or not?

1841
01:43:55,000 --> 01:43:58,515
Hey, Vin, it's not your fault.
You didn't know. Nobody did.

1842
01:43:58,640 --> 01:44:00,710
Ritchie's a crazy fuck, but he's smart.

1843
01:44:00,840 --> 01:44:03,434
He's eluded the police
and the FBl all this time.

1844
01:44:03,560 --> 01:44:05,516
Listen to him, Vin.

1845
01:44:06,040 --> 01:44:07,996
OK, Vin, forget about us.

1846
01:44:08,120 --> 01:44:11,795
But what happens if Dionna's next?
How are you gonna live with that?

1847
01:44:11,920 --> 01:44:15,230
Knowing you could've saved her
if you acted like you had balls.

1848
01:44:15,360 --> 01:44:17,316
Come on, Vin.

1849
01:44:18,680 --> 01:44:20,398
OK... OK.

1850
01:44:21,280 --> 01:44:24,113
OK, all right. l'll help you guys, OK?

1851
01:44:24,240 --> 01:44:26,959
lt's not just you, Vinny.
He fooled the whole world.

1852
01:44:27,080 --> 01:44:28,593
Yeah, OK, l said all right!

1853
01:44:28,720 --> 01:44:31,109
Just leave me alone, OK?
Shut the fuck up.

1854
01:44:31,240 --> 01:44:33,356
OK, OK. You're doin' the right thing, Vin.

1855
01:44:33,480 --> 01:44:36,677
Sure l am. Yeah, l'm a great friend.
l'm a great fuckin' friend.

1856
01:44:42,680 --> 01:44:44,636
((sound) punk rock)

1857
01:45:22,680 --> 01:45:24,398
Wait a minute. ls that Vin?

1858
01:45:24,520 --> 01:45:26,431
- Where?
- Right there.

1859
01:45:27,840 --> 01:45:30,991
That's why he didn't make the gig.
He got the dates mixed up.

1860
01:45:31,120 --> 01:45:33,076
Give me your shades.

1861
01:45:34,640 --> 01:45:36,596
Watch me fuck with him.

1862
01:45:37,240 --> 01:45:39,800
- What you gonna do?
- Watch this. Watch.

1863
01:45:52,520 --> 01:45:53,475
Hey, man.

1864
01:45:53,600 --> 01:45:56,034
- Hey!
- You're the guy! You've seen our work.

1865
01:45:56,160 --> 01:45:58,549
- Get the fuck away.
- The cult's gonna get you!

1866
01:45:58,680 --> 01:46:00,750
- What the hell's the matter?
- Hey, man!

1867
01:46:01,680 --> 01:46:04,478
Oh, shit, Ritchie. You fuckin' asshole!

1868
01:46:04,600 --> 01:46:07,558
You almost made me
fuckin' piss on myself, you fuck!

1869
01:46:09,440 --> 01:46:12,238
Jesus! What did you do to your hair?
lt looks stupid.

1870
01:46:12,360 --> 01:46:15,352
What the fuck are you doin' here?
The gig was last week.

1871
01:46:17,840 --> 01:46:20,752
Ritchie, l gotta talk to you.
l gotta be serious with you.

1872
01:46:20,880 --> 01:46:23,075
We gotta be straight to each other, OK?

1873
01:46:23,200 --> 01:46:25,156
Man to man, square business, OK?

1874
01:46:26,240 --> 01:46:30,313
l'm serious. Fuckin' look at me when
l'm talkin' to you. Are you in a cult?

1875
01:46:31,720 --> 01:46:35,554
Ritchie, answer me. Are you in
a fuckin' cult? Please tell me.

1876
01:46:35,680 --> 01:46:37,671
What kind of cult?

1877
01:46:37,800 --> 01:46:40,109
What kind of answer is that?
l'm asking...

1878
01:46:40,240 --> 01:46:43,152
Let me tell you something, funny boy.
Joey T's in there.

1879
01:46:43,280 --> 01:46:45,999
He's got them all riled up
and they're lookin' for you.

1880
01:46:46,120 --> 01:46:48,873
They've got this list
and they're spyin' on people.

1881
01:46:49,000 --> 01:46:52,231
You're on the top of the fuckin' list.
Now laugh at that shit.

1882
01:46:53,880 --> 01:46:56,110
Wait a minute. Whoa, whoa. What list?

1883
01:46:56,240 --> 01:46:58,435
You can tell me, please. Friend to friend.

1884
01:46:58,560 --> 01:47:01,120
l'm not gonna call the cops.
Are you the Son of Sam?

1885
01:47:01,240 --> 01:47:04,596
They think l'm the Son of Sam? Really?
You think l'm the Son of Sam?

1886
01:47:04,720 --> 01:47:09,077
lt doesn't matter what l think any more
cos they're in there lookin' for you.

1887
01:47:09,200 --> 01:47:11,031
Doesn't matter what you think?

1888
01:47:11,160 --> 01:47:13,674
You thought something.
Brought 'em down here on me.

1889
01:47:13,800 --> 01:47:17,793
Nah, l didn't do that. l wanted things
to be cleared out and straightened out.

1890
01:47:17,920 --> 01:47:20,832
- All right. So?
- l just told 'em to talk to you.

1891
01:47:20,960 --> 01:47:23,030
Why don't you talk to me like a man,...

1892
01:47:23,160 --> 01:47:25,390
..one on one, man to man,
like we always have?

1893
01:47:25,520 --> 01:47:27,476
- Aw, fuck.
- l wanted to.

1894
01:47:27,600 --> 01:47:30,353
You've been acting so strange
l don't know what to do.

1895
01:47:30,480 --> 01:47:33,438
- Me?
- Look at yourself in the fuckin' mirror.

1896
01:47:33,560 --> 01:47:36,632
Huh? Look at that hair.
What the fuck is that, huh?

1897
01:47:36,760 --> 01:47:39,593
A hairstyle doesn't determine
whether you're a killer.

1898
01:47:39,720 --> 01:47:41,676
- l don't mean that.
- What do you mean?

1899
01:47:41,800 --> 01:47:44,473
Normal people don't dress
the way you do...

1900
01:47:44,600 --> 01:47:46,716
Normal people?

1901
01:47:46,840 --> 01:47:50,799
You think l'm the Son of Sam and you
bring a lynch mob here to string me up.

1902
01:47:51,240 --> 01:47:53,515
- Ritchie...
- l thought you were my friend.

1903
01:47:53,640 --> 01:47:56,200
- l am your fuckin' friend.
- You're not my friend.

1904
01:47:56,320 --> 01:47:58,276
l made a fuckin' mistake. l'm sorry.

1905
01:47:58,400 --> 01:48:02,029
What do l do? Bobby the fairy says
you're a nude dancer at a fag club.

1906
01:48:02,160 --> 01:48:04,116
What am l supposed to do with that?

1907
01:48:04,240 --> 01:48:07,198
- What?
- Bobby says you're a fuckin' fag dancer.

1908
01:48:07,320 --> 01:48:09,390
Bobby the fag don't know shit, OK?

1909
01:48:09,520 --> 01:48:11,476
Cos he's a homo, now l'm one?

1910
01:48:12,280 --> 01:48:14,236
l don't know. You tell me.

1911
01:48:15,040 --> 01:48:17,429
Are you suckin' dick?
ls that what you do there?

1912
01:48:17,560 --> 01:48:19,755
First you think l'm the fuckin' Son of Sam.

1913
01:48:19,880 --> 01:48:23,190
Now l'm a fuckin' homo.
l can't believe this.

1914
01:48:24,760 --> 01:48:26,716
You lost all faith in me?

1915
01:48:30,240 --> 01:48:32,196
l don't know you, Ritchie.

1916
01:48:33,320 --> 01:48:35,276
l don't know who you fuckin' are.

1917
01:48:36,800 --> 01:48:40,873
l don't know you, man.
l don't know you, you fuck.

1918
01:48:41,000 --> 01:48:43,150
- Fuck you!
- (Ruby) Let's go, Ritchie!

1919
01:48:43,280 --> 01:48:46,670
- You're gonna need me, Ritchie.
- Don't do me any favours, asshole.

1920
01:48:46,800 --> 01:48:49,314
- (Vinny) Ruby, come here!
- He's a fuckin' prick.

1921
01:48:49,440 --> 01:48:51,556
Ruby, could you talk to him?

1922
01:48:51,680 --> 01:48:53,910
- What the fuck did you do?
- Let me talk to you.

1923
01:48:54,040 --> 01:48:55,473
(Ritchie) Ruby.

1924
01:48:56,280 --> 01:48:59,590
Go fuckin' home, Vinny!
You always start fuckin' trouble.

1925
01:48:59,720 --> 01:49:01,073
Motherfucker.

1926
01:49:01,200 --> 01:49:04,670
Those are the freakiest fuckin' people
l've ever seen in my life.

1927
01:49:04,800 --> 01:49:05,994
Fuckin' filthy.

1928
01:49:06,120 --> 01:49:09,271
l could take fuckin' ten showers,
l'd still feel dirty.

1929
01:49:10,200 --> 01:49:12,316
We didn't fuckin' see him, though, Joe.

1930
01:49:12,440 --> 01:49:14,396
Get outta the way. Whoa, whoa, whoa.

1931
01:49:14,560 --> 01:49:17,313
Fuckin' watch where you're goin',
you fuckin' freak.

1932
01:49:17,440 --> 01:49:19,396
Fuck you, Guido!

1933
01:49:19,520 --> 01:49:21,909
- What'd you say?
- Fuck you, Guido!

1934
01:49:22,040 --> 01:49:23,837
All right, man, you're drunk.

1935
01:49:23,960 --> 01:49:25,951
So we're gonna give you
one more chance.

1936
01:49:26,080 --> 01:49:28,230
Who's your favourite baseball team?

1937
01:49:28,400 --> 01:49:30,356
Boston Red Sox.

1938
01:49:31,240 --> 01:49:33,196
Motherfucker.

1939
01:49:33,320 --> 01:49:35,072
Here he comes, Joe!

1940
01:49:38,480 --> 01:49:40,596
Come here, you son of a bitch!

1941
01:49:40,720 --> 01:49:42,392
Come here!

1942
01:49:42,520 --> 01:49:44,431
Boston Red Sox!

1943
01:49:44,560 --> 01:49:48,155
Go back to Fenway,
you Beantown cocksucker!

1944
01:49:48,280 --> 01:49:51,158
- Come on, let's go home.
- l ruined my fuckin' pants!

1945
01:49:53,160 --> 01:49:55,071
(Luigi) Who does this look like?

1946
01:49:55,200 --> 01:49:58,510
- lt looks like a young Dean Martin.
- Dean Martin.

1947
01:49:58,640 --> 01:50:01,757
This looks like that guy
on the Grand Concourse - Matty.

1948
01:50:01,880 --> 01:50:04,792
- Come on. You're not serious.
- Yeah, l'm serious.

1949
01:50:04,920 --> 01:50:06,672
- Reno!
- Yo.

1950
01:50:06,800 --> 01:50:10,110
Matty on the Grand Concourse.
Bring him here. l wanna talk to him.

1951
01:50:10,240 --> 01:50:12,071
l'm on my way.

1952
01:50:14,560 --> 01:50:18,109
Nah, it doesn't look like him.
lt doesn't look like him at all.

1953
01:50:18,240 --> 01:50:20,674
What do you mean,
it doesn't look like him?

1954
01:50:20,800 --> 01:50:24,998
Vin, if you can't see what's happening,
then you're as brainwashed as Ruby is.

1955
01:50:25,120 --> 01:50:28,476
- What do you mean, l'm brainwashed?
- Look what he's doin' to her.

1956
01:50:28,600 --> 01:50:30,431
(Joey) He's fuckin' Ruby...

1957
01:50:30,560 --> 01:50:33,438
.. while people are there
and fuckin' filming it.

1958
01:50:33,560 --> 01:50:38,111
l mean, would you do that to Dionna?
Would you fuck your wife in a porn film?

1959
01:50:38,240 --> 01:50:40,196
Your wife, not mine.

1960
01:50:41,240 --> 01:50:45,233
Ruby's goin' along with it, but you don't
think he's got some spell over her?

1961
01:50:45,360 --> 01:50:47,555
He's turnin' her into a fuckin' porn star.

1962
01:50:49,520 --> 01:50:50,873
Come here.

1963
01:50:52,400 --> 01:50:55,278
Now you tell me...

1964
01:50:57,760 --> 01:51:00,433
..if that doesn't look like Ritchie.

1965
01:51:01,040 --> 01:51:03,315
- Holy shit! Let me see that.
- Son of Sam.

1966
01:51:05,240 --> 01:51:07,754
- Wake up, Vinny.
- Oh, shit!

1967
01:51:30,720 --> 01:51:32,676
Hey, Vinny, where the hell you been?

1968
01:51:32,800 --> 01:51:35,553
- Traffic was crazy. l'm sorry, baby.
- You don't call.

1969
01:51:35,680 --> 01:51:39,195
- You're three hours late.
- Traffic was terrible.

1970
01:51:39,320 --> 01:51:42,630
- Come on, sexy. Let's go.
- No, Dee, stay right where you are.

1971
01:51:42,760 --> 01:51:45,672
- Let her go. l gotta cut her hair.
- You'll cut her hair.

1972
01:51:45,800 --> 01:51:48,758
- Dee, come here. l gotta cut your hair.
- Stay where you are.

1973
01:51:48,880 --> 01:51:51,678
l'm sorry l'm late.
Just crazy things goin' on.

1974
01:51:51,800 --> 01:51:54,360
- Move, Gloria.
- What are you shovin' me for?

1975
01:51:54,480 --> 01:51:56,072
Who's next?

1976
01:51:56,200 --> 01:51:59,636
- Vinny, pull yourself together.
- See the Yankees play last night?

1977
01:51:59,760 --> 01:52:03,070
- Reggie Jackson, he's a god, huh?
- Vinny, get in the bathroom...

1978
01:52:03,200 --> 01:52:05,794
l always loved this fat fuck.

1979
01:52:05,920 --> 01:52:09,913
Take some Listerine. Pull yourself
together for these customers.

1980
01:52:10,040 --> 01:52:12,838
This is a business here. You respect it.

1981
01:52:13,840 --> 01:52:18,118
- l'm going through a tough time now.
- Yes, all right.

1982
01:52:18,240 --> 01:52:22,518
Go pull yourself together, then
we'll deal with the customers, all right?

1983
01:52:22,640 --> 01:52:26,076
- Dee, come here. l'm ready for you.
- He'll be with you in a minute.

1984
01:52:26,200 --> 01:52:27,838
Did you hear a word l just said?

1985
01:52:27,960 --> 01:52:31,999
- l don't feel like...
- l said pull yourself the fuck together.

1986
01:52:32,120 --> 01:52:35,430
Gloria, if it wasn't for me,
you wouldn't have this great place.

1987
01:52:35,560 --> 01:52:37,516
Oh, what is that supposed to mean?

1988
01:52:37,640 --> 01:52:39,596
Cos l brought all these customers.

1989
01:52:39,720 --> 01:52:42,871
- You came here because of me.
- excuse us. l'm very sorry.

1990
01:52:43,000 --> 01:52:46,356
Don't fuckin' lie. lf it wasn't for me,
none of you would be here.

1991
01:52:46,480 --> 01:52:48,994
This place was a piece of shit
before l came here!

1992
01:52:49,120 --> 01:52:51,236
Hey, watch your fuckin' mouth!

1993
01:52:52,840 --> 01:52:54,831
- This is a business
- Here, Gloria.

1994
01:52:54,960 --> 01:52:58,191
Here, Gloria. Take that.
Fuck you and fuck this place!

1995
01:52:58,320 --> 01:53:00,788
Get the fuck out of here!
Get out of my shop!

1996
01:53:00,920 --> 01:53:04,515
Fuckin' shit place! Fuck you and
your customers, you piece of shit!

1997
01:53:04,640 --> 01:53:07,916
- Fuck me, Vinny? l'm gonna fuck you!
- Fuckin' keys.

1998
01:53:12,040 --> 01:53:14,429
Forgot to lock the door, you stupid bitch.

1999
01:53:14,560 --> 01:53:16,516
Just talk to yourselves, OK?

2000
01:53:18,240 --> 01:53:20,356
Who took my fuckin' keys?
There they are.

2001
01:53:21,360 --> 01:53:23,316
My glasses. You son of a bitches.

2002
01:53:25,720 --> 01:53:28,359
((sound) ''Don't Leave Me This Way''
by Thelma Houston)

2003
01:53:28,480 --> 01:53:30,675
(Vinny) What the fuck are you doin'?

2004
01:53:33,080 --> 01:53:35,071
What are you doin', baby? Oh, come on.

2005
01:53:35,200 --> 01:53:37,919
You're not gonna fuckin' leave me.
Come on, baby.

2006
01:53:38,040 --> 01:53:40,031
Come on. l'm sorry about Gloria, OK?

2007
01:53:40,160 --> 01:53:44,119
l'm fuckin' so sorry about that shit.
lt wasn't even fuckin' worth it.

2008
01:53:44,240 --> 01:53:46,595
All this time l kept my eyes closed...

2009
01:53:46,720 --> 01:53:50,190
..and l even made myself think
that maybe it just happened once.

2010
01:53:50,320 --> 01:53:53,232
- And then l gotta hear it from Gloria?
- Dionna, l quit.

2011
01:53:53,360 --> 01:53:55,749
l quit the fuckin' shop.
The whole thing is over.

2012
01:53:55,880 --> 01:53:59,190
This is a new Vinny.
Do you understand what l'm tellin' you?

2013
01:53:59,760 --> 01:54:04,197
How many other women did you fuck
at the salon besides Gloria?

2014
01:54:05,840 --> 01:54:08,957
l'm never gonna cheat again.
l'm gonna see a fuckin' priest.

2015
01:54:09,080 --> 01:54:12,277
l'm gonna fuckin' see a psychiatrist.
l'll get fuckin' help.

2016
01:54:12,400 --> 01:54:15,198
- Cos l know l'm sick, baby. Fuckin' sick.
- How many!

2017
01:54:16,240 --> 01:54:18,196
Was one of them named Sheri?

2018
01:54:18,320 --> 01:54:21,471
Come on. l made that up for you, baby.
l made that up for you.

2019
01:54:21,600 --> 01:54:24,558
There was no fuckin' Sheri.
Don't fuckin' leave me now.

2020
01:54:24,680 --> 01:54:27,911
Let's work this shit out.
You and l can make this shit happen.

2021
01:54:28,040 --> 01:54:30,554
- Come on.
- What about Plato's Retreat?

2022
01:54:30,680 --> 01:54:33,592
(sound) My heart is full of love
and desire for you

2023
01:54:33,720 --> 01:54:36,632
OK, you're right about that.
You're right about that.

2024
01:54:36,760 --> 01:54:38,751
l'm sorry what l made you do there,
OK?

2025
01:54:38,880 --> 01:54:41,633
You're sorry about what
you made me do. What l did.

2026
01:54:41,760 --> 01:54:43,751
You're not sorry what you did to me.

2027
01:54:43,880 --> 01:54:46,952
You're not sorry that l trusted you,
and you used me.

2028
01:54:47,080 --> 01:54:50,595
l am sorry. But, baby, l'm not me, OK?

2029
01:54:50,720 --> 01:54:53,996
l'm fuckin' going through a lot of shit
right now, all right?

2030
01:54:55,720 --> 01:54:58,678
He's fuckin'... He's in a cult.

2031
01:54:58,800 --> 01:55:01,917
Ritchie's in a cult.
He's brainwashed me.

2032
01:55:02,040 --> 01:55:04,110
l don't even know
who the fuck l am lately.

2033
01:55:04,240 --> 01:55:06,196
The shit l'm doing right now is not me.

2034
01:55:06,320 --> 01:55:07,992
l'm not responsible for it.

2035
01:55:08,120 --> 01:55:09,997
Oh, come on!

2036
01:55:10,120 --> 01:55:13,032
Come on! You're blaming Ritchie
for what you're doing?

2037
01:55:13,160 --> 01:55:14,513
Come on!

2038
01:55:14,640 --> 01:55:18,519
You know what? They fuckin' think he's
the fuckin' killer, he's the Son of Sam.

2039
01:55:18,640 --> 01:55:21,598
- That's what l gotta fuckin' deal with...
- Vinny, stop it!

2040
01:55:21,720 --> 01:55:24,439
What does that have to do
with you fucking other women?

2041
01:55:24,560 --> 01:55:26,516
Come on! l am not stupid!

2042
01:55:26,640 --> 01:55:29,916
l never said you were stupid.
l'm telling you that l love you.

2043
01:55:30,040 --> 01:55:33,191
You can't fuckin' leave me over this.
We're husband and wife.

2044
01:55:33,320 --> 01:55:37,836
We had two fuckin' great years. You can't
throw that out for this piece of shit!

2045
01:55:37,960 --> 01:55:40,599
- What big-mouth Gloria says to you!
- Wanna see?

2046
01:55:40,720 --> 01:55:42,597
l'm gonna throw it all out.

2047
01:55:42,720 --> 01:55:44,870
Out the window,
just like you threw it out...

2048
01:55:45,000 --> 01:55:47,514
..when you stuck your dick
into some other woman!

2049
01:55:47,640 --> 01:55:51,076
- Throw it all out! l don't give a shit!
- Fuck you!

2050
01:55:51,200 --> 01:55:52,997
(sound) Cos only your good lovin'

2051
01:55:53,120 --> 01:55:54,348

2052
01:55:54,480 --> 01:55:56,436
Baby, look what l got for you.

2053
01:55:56,560 --> 01:55:58,994
Fuckin' flowers.
That's what l came here with.

2054
01:55:59,120 --> 01:56:03,671
l came with fuckin' flowers cos
l know l've been fuckin' up all this time.

2055
01:56:03,800 --> 01:56:07,110
And l've made some bad calls
and l'm a bad fuckin' husband.

2056
01:56:07,240 --> 01:56:10,277
l admit it. l know you can't
get away with shit in life any more.

2057
01:56:10,400 --> 01:56:13,119
You know, God sees everything,
plain and simple.

2058
01:56:13,240 --> 01:56:15,356
l want you to give me another chance.

2059
01:56:15,480 --> 01:56:18,517
- No.
- l can't live without you. Please?

2060
01:56:18,640 --> 01:56:22,110
- You can't bring God into this any more.
- l love you, baby.

2061
01:56:22,240 --> 01:56:24,356
- Baby, listen.

2062
01:56:24,480 --> 01:56:27,392
- lf you leave me, l'll fuckin' die.
- You have to listen to me.

2063
01:56:27,520 --> 01:56:30,034
OK? See.

2064
01:56:30,560 --> 01:56:33,950
l thought that what we had was...
special together.

2065
01:56:34,080 --> 01:56:36,913
lt is special. Let me make love
to you and l'll show you.

2066
01:56:37,040 --> 01:56:39,838
- Just you and me. Just you and me.
- lt is just you and me.

2067
01:56:39,960 --> 01:56:42,235
- No, it was everybody.

2068
01:56:42,360 --> 01:56:45,033

2070
01:56:47,760 --> 01:56:50,274
- And you're a liar.
- Baby, l'm so fuckin' sorry.

2071
01:56:50,400 --> 01:56:52,960
You don't fuckin' think
l hate my fuckin' self?

2072
01:56:53,080 --> 01:56:55,230
Don't leave me. Don't do this shit to me.

2073
01:56:55,360 --> 01:56:58,511
Look, l got nothin' in this life.
All l got is you.

2074
01:56:58,640 --> 01:57:02,758
lf you walk out that door, l'll fuckin'

01:58:18,640 --> 01:58:21,359
- Ruby.
- Touch me.

2098
01:58:22,240 --> 01:58:24,151
Want me to touch you?

2099
01:58:24,280 --> 01:58:26,396
Touch me!

2100
01:58:37,960 --> 01:58:40,030
- Joey, Ritchie's home.
- Joey! Joe!

2101
01:58:40,160 --> 01:58:42,116
- The sick fuck is back.
- He's back?

2102
01:58:42,240 --> 01:58:44,549
This fuckin' guy!
The fuckin' balls on him!

2103
01:58:44,680 --> 01:58:46,636
He's tryin' to disguise himself.

2104
01:58:46,760 --> 01:58:48,955
His hair?
He's got a fuckin' blond mohawk.

2105
01:58:49,080 --> 01:58:52,038
Him and Ruby are probably
tryin' to make a fast getaway.

2106
01:58:52,160 --> 01:58:55,914
All right, all right. Let's calm
the fuck down. We gotta do this right.

2107
01:58:57,600 --> 01:58:59,989
- We're all excited, Joey.
- All right. Shhh.

2108
01:59:00,120 --> 01:59:02,076
We need Vinny.

2109
01:59:04,320 --> 01:59:06,276
(Joey) Yo, Vinny!

2110
01:59:07,680 --> 01:59:10,831

2111
01:59:10,960 --> 01:59:13,918
- Vinny!

2112
01:59:14,040 --> 01:59:15,268
Vinny, veni 'cca !

2113
01:59:15,400 --> 01:59:18,676
Fuckin' shit. Fuckin' stupid.

2114
01:59:26,400 --> 01:59:29,676
Vinny? Vinny, come on.

2115
01:59:29,800 --> 01:59:31,791
(Joey) Vinny, open the door!

2116
01:59:33,240 --> 01:59:35,117
Yeah, yeah, OK. Shhh!

2117
01:59:35,960 --> 01:59:37,951
- (knocking continues)
- All right!

2118
01:59:39,080 --> 01:59:41,310
Dionna's sleepin'.
Can you come back later?

2119
01:59:41,440 --> 01:59:43,556
Take the fuckin' chain off the door.

2120
01:59:43,680 --> 01:59:45,671
Take the chain off the door.

2121
01:59:48,960 --> 01:59:50,951
Listen to me. Ritchie's the Son of Sam.

2122
01:59:51,080 --> 01:59:53,913
lf Ritchie's the Son of Sam,
why don't we call the cops?

2123
01:59:54,040 --> 01:59:57,237
- Fuck the cops!

2124
01:59:57,360 --> 02:00:00,511

2126
02:00:03,000 --> 02:00:05,719
What the fuck

2127
02:00:05,840 --> 02:00:07,831
You're the big tough guy, aren't ya?

2128
02:00:07,960 --> 02:00:09,951
Cos you got your lackeys with ya.

2129
02:00:10,080 --> 02:00:12,833
- What is the matter with your head?
- But if we went...

2130
02:00:15,400 --> 02:00:18,517
(Bobby) Listen to him, Vinny.
Just listen to Joey T.

2131
02:00:18,640 --> 02:00:20,915
- Don't hurt him!
- (Brian) easy, man. Come on.

2132
02:00:21,040 --> 02:00:22,996
Get in that fuckin' chair.

2133
02:00:23,120 --> 02:00:28,069
- You fuckin' hit me, Joey.
- l didn't come here to fight with you.

2134
02:00:28,200 --> 02:00:30,430
Ritchie's at home, OK?
We want you to help us.

2135
02:00:30,560 --> 02:00:32,755
We want you to go
and get him out of the house.

2136
02:00:32,880 --> 02:00:36,156
And then what? We're gonna
sit around and then play cards?

2137
02:00:36,280 --> 02:00:38,714
We take him to Luigi, OK?
No rough stuff.

2138
02:00:38,840 --> 02:00:41,559
l swear on my mother, Vin.
On a stack of Bibles.

2139
02:00:41,680 --> 02:00:43,955
l don't fuckin' believe you guys.
Yeah, right.

2140
02:00:44,080 --> 02:00:47,550
We're not the fuckin' black cloud
of this neighbourhood!

2141
02:00:47,680 --> 02:00:49,875
We didn't fuck up your marriage!
lt was you!

2142
02:00:50,000 --> 02:00:52,514
- Don't fuck with us.
- What are you talking about?

2143
02:00:52,640 --> 02:00:55,234
Your wife's got a big mouth.

2144
02:00:55,360 --> 02:00:56,793
You fucked up with Dionna!

2145
02:00:56,920 --> 02:00:58,797

2147
02:01:02,840 --> 02:01:04,910
You better not talk about my wife again!

2148
02:01:05,040 --> 02:01:08,077
- Don't fuck with me, you bastard!

2151
02:01:15,080 --> 02:01:16,957
Get the fuck outta here.

2152
02:01:17,080 --> 02:01:19,196
Now you listen to me, OK? All right?

2153
02:01:19,320 --> 02:01:22,198
Don't tell us that
fuckin' Dionna's in there sleepin'.

2154
02:01:22,320 --> 02:01:25,039
Cos news travels fast
in this fuckin' neighbourhood.

2155
02:01:25,160 --> 02:01:29,073
You're puttin' that shit up your nose
and taking quaaludes by the ton,...

2156
02:01:29,200 --> 02:01:31,111
..you're drinkin' like a fish.

2157
02:01:31,240 --> 02:01:33,754
You don't know what's up or down!
You understand?

2158
02:01:33,880 --> 02:01:38,237
You're gonna put your fuckin' shirt on
and come over and help us, or so God,...

2159
02:01:38,360 --> 02:01:42,399
..or so fuckin' help me God,

2160
02:01:43,160 --> 02:01:46,630
- Let's go, Vinny. Let's go! Let's go!
- l'm fuckin' going.

2161
02:01:46,760 --> 02:01:48,751
He treats him like a fuckin' pussy.

2162
02:01:48,880 --> 02:01:50,871
l say one fuckin' thing, he strangles me.

2163
02:01:51,160 --> 02:01:55,392
Police now have in custody the man
they believe is the .-Calibre Killer,...

2164
02:01:55,520 --> 02:01:56,316
..Son of Sam.

2165
02:01:56,440 --> 02:01:59,955
He was arrested outside his home
at 5 Pine Street in Yonkers.

2166
02:02:01,160 --> 02:02:02,832
New York City can now finally rest.

2167
02:02:02,960 --> 02:02:05,474
- Thank God.
- l thought he'd be from Brooklyn.

2168
02:02:14,400 --> 02:02:16,516
Police! Don't move! Get against the car!

2169
02:02:16,640 --> 02:02:18,278
Give me your hands. One at a time.

2170
02:02:18,400 --> 02:02:20,436
Give me your right hand. Now!

2171
02:02:20,560 --> 02:02:22,915
Give me your other hand.
One at a time. Slowly.

2172
02:02:23,040 --> 02:02:25,838
lnspector Dowd, you finally got me.

2173
02:02:25,960 --> 02:02:28,349
And now that l've got you,
who is it that l've got?

2174
02:02:28,480 --> 02:02:31,040
- You know.
- No, l don't know. You tell me.

2175
02:02:31,160 --> 02:02:32,718
l'm Sam.

2176
02:02:32,840 --> 02:02:35,195
You're Sam. Sam who?

2177
02:02:35,320 --> 02:02:37,629
Sam. Dave Berkowitz.

2178
02:02:37,760 --> 02:02:40,228
A large crowd has gathered here...

2179
02:02:40,360 --> 02:02:45,354
..awaiting the arrival of
Son of Sam suspect David Berkowitz.

2180
02:02:45,480 --> 02:02:48,153
The police have put up barricades...

2181
02:02:48,280 --> 02:02:52,114
..to protect the alleged .-Calibre Killer...

2182
02:02:52,240 --> 02:02:54,674
..from a potential lynch mob.

2183
02:02:54,800 --> 02:02:57,872
lt's a great outpouring of relief,...

2184
02:02:58,000 --> 02:03:00,878
..rage and vengeance.

2185
02:03:01,000 --> 02:03:02,877
Kill him! Kill him!

2186
02:03:03,000 --> 02:03:05,195
((sound) ''Won't Get Fooled Again'' by The Who)

2187
02:03:19,240 --> 02:03:23,119
Ladies and gentlemen,
here he comes... Son of Sam.

2188
02:03:23,240 --> 02:03:26,789
(sound) With our children at our feet

2189
02:03:26,920 --> 02:03:29,480
(sound) And the morals that they worship

2190
02:03:29,600 --> 02:03:31,556
(sound) Will be gone

2191
02:03:34,040 --> 02:03:36,508
We don't know which car he's in.

2192
02:03:36,640 --> 02:03:40,394
(sound) Sit in judgement of all wrong

2193
02:03:40,520 --> 02:03:42,715
(Jeffries) lt's pure pandemonium,...

2194
02:03:42,840 --> 02:03:46,310
..hysteria, chaos.

2195
02:03:46,440 --> 02:03:47,839
They're slowing down.

2196
02:03:47,960 --> 02:03:50,679
Ed, do we see him?

2197
02:03:50,800 --> 02:03:52,597
Yes!

2198
02:03:52,720 --> 02:03:55,234
There he is, ladies and gentlemen!

2199
02:03:55,360 --> 02:03:57,237
(sound) Smile and grin at the change all around

2200
02:03:57,360 --> 02:03:59,191
David Berkowitz!

2201
02:04:00,760 --> 02:04:03,991
lt's David Berkowitz! There he is!

2202
02:04:04,120 --> 02:04:06,554
The alleged .-Calibre Killer.

2203
02:04:06,680 --> 02:04:09,069
- (knocking at door)
- Who is it?

2204
02:04:09,200 --> 02:04:12,476
He has a crazed look on his face.

2205
02:04:18,200 --> 02:04:20,919
Ritchie, it's me, Vinny.
Open up. Come on, open up.

2206
02:04:21,040 --> 02:04:22,598
What the fuck does he want?

2207
02:04:26,840 --> 02:04:29,479
(sound) The change it had to come

2208
02:04:30,320 --> 02:04:32,675
(sound) We knew it all along

2209
02:04:36,480 --> 02:04:39,199
- What do you want?
- How ya doin'?

2210
02:04:40,680 --> 02:04:42,591
(sound) The world looks just the same

2211
02:04:42,720 --> 02:04:44,676
lt's that hair. lt's ridiculous.

2212
02:04:44,800 --> 02:04:46,995
- Come on. Cut to the chase.
- Hey, Ruby.

2213
02:04:47,120 --> 02:04:48,951
- Uh-huh.
- How's it going?

2214
02:04:49,080 --> 02:04:51,150
- Fine.
- Mind if l borrow him for a minute?

2215
02:04:51,280 --> 02:04:52,235
Yep.

2216
02:04:54,400 --> 02:04:58,109
(sound) l'll tip my hat to the new constitution

2217
02:04:58,240 --> 02:05:00,356
Get him! You get him!

2218
02:05:01,800 --> 02:05:02,789
You get him!

2219
02:05:06,040 --> 02:05:07,871
Kill him! Kill him!

2220
02:05:08,000 --> 02:05:10,560
- l gotta talk to you.
- About what?

2221
02:05:10,680 --> 02:05:12,238
Dionna.

2222
02:05:12,800 --> 02:05:14,756
(Vinny) She left me.

2223
02:05:17,400 --> 02:05:19,595
She's gonna divorce me. lt's all over.

2224
02:05:19,720 --> 02:05:20,835
- No.
- Oh, yeah.

2225
02:05:20,960 --> 02:05:23,190
All right, come in, man. Come inside.

2226
02:05:24,480 --> 02:05:26,436
l don't want to go inside.

2227
02:05:26,560 --> 02:05:29,552
l don't want her to hear me. Come on.
Come over here.

2228
02:05:29,680 --> 02:05:32,558
Come on. Talk to me over here.
Please. Come on.

2229
02:05:33,600 --> 02:05:35,830
All right. l'll be right back.

2230
02:05:47,640 --> 02:05:49,392
Ritchie...

2231
02:05:49,520 --> 02:05:51,670
l had this big fight with Gloria, right?

2232
02:05:51,800 --> 02:05:55,588
So she calls Dionna and tells her
about all the women l've been with.

2233
02:05:55,720 --> 02:05:57,676
Dionna flips out and wants to leave me.

2234
02:05:57,800 --> 02:06:01,588
She wants a divorce cos l took her
to Plato's Retreat. We had two-on-ones...

2235
02:06:01,720 --> 02:06:03,597
l don't know what to tell you.

2236
02:06:03,720 --> 02:06:06,280
We're leaving tonight,
so maybe you should, too.

2237
02:06:06,400 --> 02:06:08,550
- You should get outta here.
- l'm doin' that.

2238
02:06:08,680 --> 02:06:11,114
You know something... (mumbles)
Run, Ritchie.

2239
02:06:11,240 --> 02:06:13,549
- What?
- Sorry about everything. Please run.

2240
02:06:13,680 --> 02:06:15,113
What are you talkin' about?

2241
02:06:15,240 --> 02:06:17,390
- Come on, come on!
- Run. Get the fuck out!

2242
02:06:17,520 --> 02:06:19,829
- Now!

2243
02:06:22,440 --> 02:06:24,954

2244
02:06:25,080 --> 02:06:27,913

You don't listen.

2246
02:06:30,040 --> 02:06:32,600
Come on! What do you got?

2247
02:06:32,720 --> 02:06:34,597
(all shouting)

2248
02:06:35,360 --> 02:06:38,909
- Vinny! What the fuck are you doing?
- Come on, Ritchie!

2249
02:06:46,160 --> 02:06:47,354
Get off me!

2250
02:06:49,600 --> 02:06:51,556
Ritchie, eat this!

2251
02:07:01,960 --> 02:07:03,518
(Ruby) Get off me!

2252
02:07:03,640 --> 02:07:06,552
- You cocksucker!
- Come on, you piece of shit!

2253
02:07:06,680 --> 02:07:08,557
You don't look so tough now!

2254
02:07:11,800 --> 02:07:14,758
- Come on, break 'em up!
- Ritchie!

2255
02:07:14,880 --> 02:07:17,633
- You're comin' with us.

2256
02:07:19,240 --> 02:07:22,152
- Come with us!
- We're gonna see Luigi right now.

2257
02:07:22,280 --> 02:07:25,670
Listen up. You ain't gettin' out
of fuckin' this one this time.

2258
02:07:25,800 --> 02:07:28,234
(Ruby) Leave him alone!

2259
02:07:32,480 --> 02:07:34,550
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Shit!

2260
02:07:34,680 --> 02:07:37,399
You get the fuck away from him!
Get away from him!

2261
02:07:37,520 --> 02:07:40,671
What the fuck is goin' on here?
What the fuck is goin' on?

2262
02:07:41,720 --> 02:07:44,553
We takin' the Son of Sam to Luigi!
Don't fuck with us!

2263
02:07:44,680 --> 02:07:47,956
He ain't the Son of Sam.
They caught him, it's all over the news.

2264
02:07:48,080 --> 02:07:52,073
- They got him in Yonkers, you idiot!
- You're fuckin' lying!

2265
02:07:52,200 --> 02:07:55,431
Oh, yeah? Tell me my Luger's full of shit.
Fuck with this, hero.

2266
02:07:55,560 --> 02:07:58,074
- My Luger says they caught him, OK?
- All right.

2267
02:07:58,200 --> 02:08:00,919
One of you call an ambulance!
Now, or l start shooting.

2268
02:08:01,040 --> 02:08:03,998
You, you, go and get a blanket.
lt's on the couch.

2269
02:08:05,480 --> 02:08:08,199
Talk to me! What happened?

2270
02:08:08,320 --> 02:08:10,595
Oh, my God, Ritchie!

2271
02:08:18,920 --> 02:08:20,831
(sound) There's nothing in the street

2272
02:08:20,960 --> 02:08:22,393
Just get outta here!

2273
02:08:22,520 --> 02:08:24,112
Get away!

2274
02:08:24,800 --> 02:08:26,313
(Ritchie) Mommy!

2275
02:08:26,440 --> 02:08:30,558
(sound) And the slogans are replaced by and by

2276
02:08:33,040 --> 02:08:36,396
- Ritchie! Lay still, please!
- (Eddie) Just leave him here.

2277
02:08:36,520 --> 02:08:39,717
You fuckin' traitor!
What the fuck are you doin'?

2278
02:08:45,560 --> 02:08:47,516
l'm sorry.

2279
02:08:53,640 --> 02:08:55,596
Did you call an ambulance?

2280
02:08:55,720 --> 02:08:58,439
Yeah, it's coming. lt's coming right now.

2281
02:08:58,560 --> 02:09:00,516
lt better be.

2282
02:09:08,680 --> 02:09:11,956
Of all the things,
a parking ticket did Son of Sam in.

2283
02:09:12,080 --> 02:09:16,358
On July 1, 1 977,
he shot his last two victims.

2284
02:09:16,480 --> 02:09:20,553
An eyewitness noticed a parking ticket
under his windshield as he sped away.

2285
02:09:20,680 --> 02:09:25,151
Of the four tickets issued in that area,
one bore the name of David Berkowitz,...

2286
02:09:25,280 --> 02:09:27,032
..a resident of Yonkers, New York.

2287
02:09:27,160 --> 02:09:29,549
At first, Berkowitz claimed insanity...

2288
02:09:29,680 --> 02:09:33,195
..saying a ,-year-old dog
named Harvey told him to do it.

2289
02:09:33,320 --> 02:09:35,231
Eventually he pled guilty.

2290
02:09:35,360 --> 02:09:37,920
That sick fuck is serving a sentence...

2291
02:09:38,040 --> 02:09:42,033
..of six consecutive terms
of 5 years to life.

2292
02:09:42,160 --> 02:09:45,755
(commentator)
The Yankees win their 1st World Series.

2293
02:09:45,880 --> 02:09:49,919
(Breslin) The New York Yankees won the
World Series against the LA Dodgers,...

2294
02:09:50,040 --> 02:09:54,158
..led by Reggie Jackson's dramatic
three consecutive home runs...

2295
02:09:54,280 --> 02:09:56,236
..in the sixth and deciding game.

2296
02:10:05,840 --> 02:10:08,115
(Breslin) Elvis Presley died.

2297
02:10:08,240 --> 02:10:10,435
, 7 were arrested
during the blackout,...

2298
02:10:10,560 --> 02:10:14,189
.. with damage going into
the hundreds of millions.

2299
02:10:14,320 --> 02:10:16,470
To no one's surprise,
most of the destruction...

2300
02:10:16,600 --> 02:10:20,639
..took place in Brooklyn,
Harlem and the South Bronx.

2301
02:10:20,760 --> 02:10:24,833
'77 was also one of the hottest summers
in memory in New York City.

2302
02:10:24,960 --> 02:10:28,589
New York, the city
that l love and hate equally.

2303
02:10:28,720 --> 02:10:31,553
There are eight million stories
in the Naked City...

2304
02:10:31,680 --> 02:10:33,432
..and this was one of them.
