The SCLC has direct Communist ties.

3
00:00:30,613 --> 00:00:33,282
Even great men can be corrupted,
can't they?

4
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:36,994
Communism is not a political party.
It is a disease.

5
00:00:37,162 --> 00:00:39,788
It corrupts the soul,
turning even the gentlest of men...

It all starts out peacefully,
doesn't it, Mr. lrwin?

13

the bombings and the violence.

to Paterson on Valentine's Day?

Yes, of course, Miss Gandy.

337

HOOVER: I took the train to Paterson,
New Jersey, on February 14th.

If I could catch these radicals red-handed...

339

...then the Labor Department would have
to put them all on boats back home.

So agents of the Bureau,
alongside local police...

...began raiding gathering places
of known communist radicals...

...all across this country.

These people are armed and violent.

We'd solved the bombings.

And, in the end, we arrested nearly
4000 communist radicals...

...and deported over 500 of them.

It was accomplished against great odds

five pistols, two automatics.

Some did, and there's the lesson.

You see, the bombs stopped,
and peace came.

369
00:24:02,816 --> 00:24:05,860
The American people had forgotten
there ever was a threat.

370
00:24:06,027 --> 00:24:08,863
So when political adversaries
attacked Palmer...

from communism...

...our countrymen allowed it to happen.

Because like today, they've forgotten
the bombs, the blood, the fear.

SMITH: But why Palmer and not you,
if you orchestrated the raids?

have been born into a communist state...

- Harlan Fiske Stone.
- Yes, sir, Attorney General Stone.

He called you into his office
and told you to sit down, sir.

394
00:25:33,406 --> 00:25:35,824
Sir, there are over a dozen vacancies
in Chicago.

395
00:25:35,992 --> 00:25:39,036
And with the robbery rates rising,
it would profit the Bureau...

396
00:25:39,204 --> 00:25:41,455
...to start filling vacancies
and make recoveries.

397

and with a congressional hearing...

this meeting, I did. Sit down.

And there's a reason for that.

This Bureau is of exceedingly bad odor.
Would you agree?

402
00:26:04,020 --> 00:26:05,312
Yes, sir.

403
00:26:06,106 --> 00:26:08,399
And, no offense,
you seem to have no social life.

404
00:26:08,567 --> 00:26:13,821
No wife, no girlfriend.
As far as I can tell, no pals at all.

405
00:26:16,533 --> 00:26:18,075
That is accurate, sir.

406
00:26:18,243 --> 00:26:22,413
And you're shamelessly distracted
by this hodgepodge fingerprinting affair.

407
00:26:22,581 --> 00:26:27,501
Sir, it wouldn't be hodgepodge if we could
centralize the prints here, I assure you.

408
00:26:27,669 --> 00:26:29,837
It's a speculative science at best.

The Bureau must be divorced from politics
and not be a catchall for political hacks.

422
00:27:21,890 --> 00:27:25,059
Recruits must be college-educated.

423
00:27:25,352 --> 00:27:28,062
Appointments must be based on merit.

424

...he must so conduct himself,
both officially and unofficially...

00:39:28,032 --> 00:39:31,451
...to a fatter paycheck in private practice,
Mr. Tolson?

621
00:39:35,456 --> 00:39:38,291
Is there something the matter,
Mr. Tolson?

622
00:39:38,459 --> 00:39:40,460
No, sir.

623
00:39:40,628 --> 00:39:43,630
Ls exercise a requirement
for all agents, sir?

624
00:39:45,883 --> 00:39:49,803
Yes. All our agents need to be
in top physical condition.

625
00:39:49,970 --> 00:39:54,307
We must outsmart and outmatch
the public enemy at every turn.

626
00:39:54,475 --> 00:39:56,017
Yes, of course.

627
00:39:56,185 --> 00:39:59,479
So, uh, what routine do you do, sir?

628
00:39:59,647 --> 00:40:03,108
Push-ups, sit-ups, and squatting.

629
00:40:04,485 --> 00:40:05,777
I see.

630
00:40:05,945 --> 00:40:07,654
Would you like me to fix the curtain?

631
00:40:08,406 --> 00:40:09,989
Or perhaps I could open a window.

632
00:40:10,157 --> 00:40:12,617
I always prefer
a little bit of air after exercise.

633
00:40:12,785 --> 00:40:14,702
Don't you?

634
00:40:15,496 --> 00:40:16,996
If it would please you.

635
00:40:18,124 --> 00:40:21,126
And, sir, where I may fall short
in terms of rsum...

636
00:40:22,128 --> 00:40:25,797
...l apparently far exceed
the rest in terms of honesty.

637
00:40:26,924 --> 00:40:28,591
I didn't lie to get this appointment, sir.

638
00:40:28,759 --> 00:40:31,219
Like the rest, yes,
I would like to start a practice...

639
00:40:31,387 --> 00:40:37,016
...but I could be persuaded otherwise
if the right opportunities were to arise.

640
00:40:38,519 --> 00:40:40,019
Hmm.

641

Fair enough, Mr. Tolson.

642
00:40:46,193 --> 00:40:47,485
Fair enough.

643
00:41:00,291 --> 00:41:02,292
These sleeves seem to be
the correct length.

644
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:04,002
I found you two tie options.

645
00:41:04,170 --> 00:41:06,379
This one is a bit more fashion-forward...

646
00:41:06,547 --> 00:41:09,090
...but it would complement this suit
and cut and fabric.

647
00:41:09,258 --> 00:41:10,800
It's too loud, don't you think?

648
00:41:10,968 --> 00:41:13,678
Too loud? Okay, which is why
I found this one, the backup.

649
00:41:13,846 --> 00:41:18,558
- It's a bit more directorial, a little bit more...
- It's a little bit more reserved, I agree.

while the person was on their way up...

You see, it was a miscalculation.

but not the weight of a man and child.

He thinks we're all fools.

He'll go around them too.
He's going to bargain with the kidnappers.

so that they have a fighting chance...

of the most dangerous characters...

then what child is safe?

as a go-between with the kidnappers.

Now, was Condon a criminal too?

01:08:31,023 --> 01:08:35,443
I have made investigations.
I administer several cases at once.

1077
01:08:36,612 --> 01:08:38,029
Well, that's not what I asked.

1078
01:08:38,197 --> 01:08:42,867
The comic books show you with a machine
gun, making arrests. Ls that just fiction?

1079
01:08:46,539 --> 01:08:48,164
[CLEARS THROAT]

1080
01:08:49,834 --> 01:08:52,377
I am responsible for
thousands of arrests, sir.

1081
01:08:53,587 --> 01:08:56,881
So you admit it is pure fiction.

1082
01:08:57,466 --> 01:09:02,220
In fact, it wasn't you who hunted down
and captured John Dillinger at all.

1083
01:09:02,513 --> 01:09:05,140
It was Agent Purvis. Ls that correct?

1084
01:09:06,392 --> 01:09:10,520
I was in charge of all of those
investigations...

1085
01:09:10,855 --> 01:09:14,899
...but, no, sir, I have not personally
made an arrest.

1086
01:09:21,240 --> 01:09:23,241
Any other questions, gentlemen?

1087
01:09:24,243 --> 01:09:26,369
MAN:
Let's bring it to a vote.

1088
01:09:29,874 --> 01:09:31,332
Put those away.

1089
01:09:36,422 --> 01:09:37,839
TOLSON:
Well, that didn't go well.

1090
01:09:38,007 --> 01:09:40,758
We spend our lives working
and we get a political attack?

1091
01:09:40,926 --> 01:09:44,429
What does he expect, crimes to go
unsolved? Why is he fighting me?

1092
01:09:44,597 --> 01:09:46,681
I want you to start a file
on Senator McKellar.

1093
01:09:46,849 --> 01:09:48,641
I want four agents on him at all times.

1094
01:09:48,809 --> 01:09:51,769
I want to know what's in his trash, I want 
you to photograph him at every dinner.

1095
01:09:51,937 --> 01:09:55,607
Don't get in the car. You can walk back.

1096
01:09:55,774 --> 01:09:58,276
Edgar we have lunch. We don't miss lunch 
no matter what, remember ?

1097
01:09:58,444 --> 01:10:00,278
You pulled away from me in there.

1098
01:10:00,446 --> 01:10:03,781
You perjured yourself Edgar, and the 
lie was an easily provable one.

1099
01:10:03,949 --> 01:10:05,950
If you continue to persue it there's no 
telling how much worse it could've been.

1100
01:10:06,118 --> 01:10:09,996
Find Agent Purvis. He is to be
demoted immediately or better yet, fired.

1101
01:10:10,164 --> 01:10:12,832
Firing the man who killed John Dillinger
would be a PR disaster.

1102
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:15,251
Then he is to spend the rest of his career
behind a desk.

1103
01:10:15,419 --> 01:10:19,339
And if he'd like to keep that job,
he'd best stay out of the papers. Go.
