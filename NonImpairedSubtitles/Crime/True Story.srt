Hey, these things happen
all the time.

164
00:09:39,813 --> 00:09:41,012
Let's go tell him.

165
00:09:41,614 --> 00:09:42,814
Sure.

166
00:09:42,949 --> 00:09:44,282
You better bring
your old notebooks.

167
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:46,952
They've also taken issue
with some of the content.

168
00:09:46,954 --> 00:09:48,353
It's all checkable.

169
00:09:48,355 --> 00:09:50,288
None of it
should be a problem.

170
00:09:50,290 --> 00:09:51,756
Fifteen minutes?

171
00:09:52,592 --> 00:09:53,692
Sure.

172
00:09:56,896 --> 00:09:58,763
Is this him or not?

173
00:10:00,833 --> 00:10:02,233
Everything I wrote
about Male

174
00:10:02,235 --> 00:10:03,368
happened to at least
one of the boys.

175
00:10:05,037 --> 00:10:08,840
Is this or is this not
Youssouf Male?

176
00:10:09,041 --> 00:10:11,776
This boy with scars
like a mountain range.

177
00:10:11,911 --> 00:10:13,845
Yes, it is.

178
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:15,780
You sure?
Yes, I'm sure.

179
00:10:17,850 --> 00:10:20,785
Okay, great.
So just show us where
his details are in here.

180
00:10:28,728 --> 00:10:29,794
I can't do that.

181
00:10:30,329 --> 00:10:31,730
Why not?

182
00:10:31,864 --> 00:10:33,865
Because I didn't
take notes that day.

183
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:35,934
It might not be him?

184
00:10:43,743 --> 00:10:46,277
This article was about
saving young people's lives.

185
00:10:46,812 --> 00:10:48,847
I wanted to write about
all the kids I interviewed.

186
00:10:48,849 --> 00:10:50,015
I came back with
a plan for that.

187
00:10:50,017 --> 00:10:52,350
A more
aggressive story about

188
00:10:52,352 --> 00:10:54,219
the corruption within
these aid agencies.

189
00:10:54,221 --> 00:10:56,287
But we felt
it was too broad.

190
00:10:56,289 --> 00:10:57,856
Don't imply
this has anything to do

191
00:10:57,858 --> 00:10:59,224
with anyone
other than you, Mike.

192
00:10:59,226 --> 00:11:00,358
You said
write about one boy.

193
00:11:01,661 --> 00:11:02,694
Suggest the issues
through one boy's story.

194
00:11:02,696 --> 00:11:04,029
A personal portrait.

195
00:11:04,031 --> 00:11:06,097
And you were right.
You were absolutely right.

196
00:11:06,232 --> 00:11:07,966
I assumed you had
the research.

197
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:09,768
I did, just not
all in one place.

198
00:11:09,902 --> 00:11:09,901
Then that's not research.

199
00:11:09,903 --> 00:11:13,838
Mike, you must understand
how damaging this could be

200
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:15,740
for the charities
who work with these children.

201
00:11:15,908 --> 00:11:17,042
Not to mention
the paper.

202
00:11:17,376 --> 00:11:17,375
You said write it up.

203
00:11:17,377 --> 00:11:20,979
I... I thought it could work
on a higher level.

204
00:11:20,981 --> 00:11:23,114
I said write it up,
not make it up.

205
00:11:23,249 --> 00:11:24,983
The higher level
is the truth.

206
00:11:24,985 --> 00:11:26,117
You didn't have
the research,

207
00:11:26,119 --> 00:11:28,119
that's the only fact
that matters here.

208
00:11:29,321 --> 00:11:31,790
Do you think this stuff
writes itself?

209
00:11:31,924 --> 00:11:36,061
You hire people like me
to get on the ground
and hunt.

210
00:11:36,262 --> 00:11:38,930
That's how this paper
has competitive advantage.

211
00:11:39,131 --> 00:11:40,732
I did the best
with what I had.

212
00:11:40,866 --> 00:11:42,467
You lied.

213
00:11:43,069 --> 00:11:45,070
I just can't understand why.

214
00:11:45,204 --> 00:11:47,706
It's not like
you had anything
to prove to any of us,

215
00:11:47,708 --> 00:11:49,074
you're an exceptional
journalist.

216
00:11:49,408 --> 00:11:49,407
It just bewilders me.

217
00:11:49,409 --> 00:11:53,344
We'll have to be open
with our readers
about this, Mike,

218
00:11:53,346 --> 00:11:54,879
which is no small
embarrassment.

219
00:11:54,881 --> 00:11:54,879
Explain what you've done.

220
00:11:54,881 --> 00:11:58,750
Do you know what that means
for those poor kids?

221
00:11:58,884 --> 00:12:02,020
For the support your article
gave them, for their futures?

222
00:12:02,354 --> 00:12:03,455
For your future?

223
00:12:03,457 --> 00:12:04,889
What the fuck
were you thinking?

224
00:12:05,024 --> 00:12:06,157
Okay, that's enough, Karen.

225
00:12:10,896 --> 00:12:12,430
All right. (STAMMERS)

226
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:17,902
I can,
um, write a retraction,
if that's what you want.

227
00:12:17,904 --> 00:12:19,904
That's what I can do.
I can go...
I'll go right now.

228
00:12:20,039 --> 00:12:23,308
(STAMMERS) I'll go
and I'll just write you
a retraction,

229
00:12:23,310 --> 00:12:24,509
if that's what
you want, okay?

230

(EXHALES)

231
00:12:34,453 --> 00:12:38,056
Just, can you not print
the apology?

232
00:12:41,794 --> 00:12:44,095
If you print the apology,
no one will touch me.

233
00:12:44,097 --> 00:12:45,463
Can you just...
Can you do that?

234
00:12:45,798 --> 00:12:47,198
Can you just not print
the apology?

235
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:49,067
Just that, please?

236
00:12:52,338 --> 00:12:54,939
You have a great future
ahead of you, Mike.

237

he denied
all knowledge of it,

they had enough
to bring him in.

He was just a regular guy,

where they were found.

According to the coroner,
MaryJane and Madison

533
00:30:15,580 --> 00:30:18,415
were beaten
and strangled to death,

534
00:30:18,417 --> 00:30:20,384
and then zipped inside
two suitcases

535
00:30:20,386 --> 00:30:23,253
with free weights
and dropped here,

536
00:30:23,255 --> 00:30:25,989
breaking a water pipe
on the way down,

537
00:30:25,991 --> 00:30:27,591

the next morning

are driven 15 miles south

543
00:30:39,071 --> 00:30:41,939
and dropped in the water
at Waldport, over there.

MICHAEL: Why drive 15 miles

545
00:30:44,043 --> 00:30:46,577
to dump bodies on the edge
of the next town?

Don't you find that odd?

00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:50,280
Maybe something in him
wanted to get caught.

MICHAEL: Then why'd flee?

I guess
he changed his mind.

So this is
where he dropped them.

It's not high enough
to kill them outright,

incredibly guilty.

CHRISTIAN:
It all came at once,

658
00:38:07,619 --> 00:38:09,452
and I had
five mouths to feed,

659
00:38:09,454 --> 00:38:11,021
so I took any job
I could get.

660
00:38:11,355 --> 00:38:12,989
That was when
you started stealing?

You know about that?

662
00:38:18,496 --> 00:38:20,363
It was just small amounts.

663
00:38:20,365 --> 00:38:23,033
Food and clothes,
and diapers. Books.

664
00:38:24,568 --> 00:38:25,635
That

665
00:38:26,604 --> 00:38:28,872
teddy bear
they found with Madison,

666
00:38:28,874 --> 00:38:31,474
with her body.
That was originally Zach's.

667
00:38:32,476 --> 00:38:35,478
And it was
handed down to Sadie
and then to Madison.

668
00:38:36,380 --> 00:38:38,915
All because
I couldn't buy new toys.

669
00:38:40,518 --> 00:38:42,519
I mean, what kind
of loser can't even...

670
00:38:43,654 --> 00:38:46,056
That says more about you
than anything.

671
00:38:46,657 --> 00:38:48,458
It does?

672
00:38:48,460 --> 00:38:50,393
That's exactly what I would
want to use in the book.

673

Chris, it's not easy

674

to relate to someone
who's accused of four murders.

675
00:38:58,669 --> 00:39:01,538
But everyone understands
a child needing a toy.

676
00:39:03,374 --> 00:39:04,941
And the teddy bear
ending up...

677
00:39:04,943 --> 00:39:07,077
It's like it died
when she died.

that way.

he writes is really...

don't you?

I don't presume
anything anymore.

692

I'm going to say a word,

for "love" I wrote
"Mike and Jill."

What?

709
00:40:57,054 --> 00:40:59,789
I guess I was just
looking at you

00:41:01,659 --> 00:41:03,660
and I thought you were
writing about her.

Maybe you were, in a way.

you would have written "M.J."

Help how?

00:55:33,096 --> 00:55:35,631
Tell us what you and Longo
have discussed.

962
00:55:35,765 --> 00:55:37,566
Let us review any letters

for you.

Your cooperation

967
00:55:50,381 --> 00:55:52,715
between him being
found guilty or set free.

968
00:55:53,450 --> 00:55:55,117
Set free?
What are you talking about?

969
00:55:55,119 --> 00:55:56,518
He pleaded guilty.

970
00:55:56,520 --> 00:55:59,988
We think he might be trying
to confuse the jury

971
00:55:59,990 --> 00:56:01,790
as part of
some bigger game plan.

972
00:56:02,392 --> 00:56:05,527
If he can sow enough doubt
to force a mistrial,
he's won.

973
00:56:06,396 --> 00:56:08,430
I know this doesn't make
any sense right now,

a lot of killers

Longo has this calm
about him.

He knows something.

979

with an exceptionally
dangerous man

981
00:56:27,484 --> 00:56:29,151
and he will kill again
if he is allowed.

982
00:56:29,153 --> 00:56:31,620

CORONER: Neither of
the children's bodies

1112
01:03:49,593 --> 01:03:50,992
displayed any evidence of

1113
01:03:50,994 --> 01:03:50,992
having struggled
with an attacker,

1114
01:03:50,994 --> 01:03:55,597
which suggests
they likely knew
and trusted their killer.

1115
01:03:58,234 --> 01:04:00,202
Both Zachary and Sadie

1116
01:04:00,204 --> 01:04:02,103
had Play-Doh
under their fingernails.

1117
01:04:04,073 --> 01:04:07,142
Sadie's toenails were painted
with a pearlescent polish,

1118
01:04:07,977 --> 01:04:10,612
the same as
on MaryJane's toes.

1119
01:04:11,881 --> 01:04:13,882
They likely painted
them together.

Tiny scratch marks
here indicate

1123
01:04:27,865 --> 01:04:29,164
Madison must have
come around

1124
01:04:29,166 --> 01:04:32,234
at some point
before she drowned.

1125

Dozens of facial
capillaries burst

1126
01:04:34,905 --> 01:04:36,638
as she struggled for air.

1127
01:04:37,173 --> 01:04:39,975
MaryJane's body was found
in this suitcase.

1128
01:04:40,142 --> 01:04:43,211
This was a violent
and frenzied act.

1129
01:04:43,613 --> 01:04:45,347
A ferocious attack.

1130
01:04:46,082 --> 01:04:48,016
Her neck has been broken.

1131
01:04:49,018 --> 01:04:51,152
Though this looks like
it may have happened
after she died,

into the suitcase.

about the van, she hit me.

I should get out

asleep with Maddie.

When I woke her,
she pushed past me

the time I was supposed
to be at work.

1199
01:09:14,618 --> 01:09:17,418
So I offered to call in sick,

1200
01:09:18,220 --> 01:09:20,188
but MaryJane said I had to go

1201
01:09:20,190 --> 01:09:21,623
because we were
in such a deep hole,

1202

we couldn't afford
any more sick days.

Uh, she was inside.

1210
01:09:42,778 --> 01:09:44,779
She was wearing

And she wouldn't speak.

1212
01:09:50,586 --> 01:09:53,321
And then she collapsed.

1213
01:09:53,656 --> 01:09:56,191
I asked her what was wrong.

1214
01:09:56,525 --> 01:09:58,326
And I was actually

01:09:58,661 --> 01:10:01,596
getting irritated
because she wouldn't answer.

She was just sobbing.

1217
01:10:04,266 --> 01:10:08,403
So I went into
the bedroom to change,

1218

and that's...

1219

So, I went over

the jury has answered yes.

Order.

1433
01:23:14,990 --> 01:23:16,123
Mr. Longo,

1434
01:23:17,459 --> 01:23:19,293
you had the opportunity

1435
01:23:19,295 --> 01:23:22,262
to spare the relatives
of your victims further pain

1436
01:23:22,397 --> 01:23:26,000
by admitting the true extent
of your crime.

1437
01:23:27,469 --> 01:23:30,337
Instead,
you manipulated this court

1438
01:23:30,339 --> 01:23:32,406
like you manipulated
your family

1439
01:23:32,540 --> 01:23:35,342
despite the overwhelming
evidence against you.

1440
01:23:38,279 --> 01:23:40,214
Blaming your wife

1441
01:23:40,415 --> 01:23:43,283
for killing her own children

1442
01:23:43,485 --> 01:23:47,755
was a grotesque betrayal,
both of her and her memory.

1443
01:23:49,557 --> 01:23:52,359
You must have realized
no one would believe you.

1444
01:23:55,764 --> 01:23:58,432
Quite frankly,
you are a mystery to me.

1445
01:24:00,635 --> 01:24:03,704
And, God willing,
you will remain so.

1446
01:24:05,573 --> 01:24:07,775
I therefore place you
in the custody of

1447

Nobody wrote me back
at first, which hurt.

1462
01:26:55,810 --> 01:26:57,344
And I must be
getting better,

1463
01:26:57,346 --> 01:27:00,681
because, uh, I've had
two marriage proposals.

that came out of all this

is that I got to meet you.

1467

And I even screwed that up.

Yeah.

Is that why you wrote to me?

(SIGHS)

1474
01:27:39,021 --> 01:27:40,287
I did it.

1475
01:27:44,325 --> 01:27:45,859
I killed MaryJane.

1476
01:27:48,463 --> 01:27:52,599
When I got there that night,
she was straddling the bed

1477
01:27:53,334 --> 01:27:55,302
and she was pushing a pillow

1478
01:27:55,304 --> 01:27:57,004
down towards the mattress.

1479
01:27:58,006 --> 01:28:00,007
Underneath, I saw Madison.

1480
01:28:00,675 --> 01:28:02,409
Fighting.

1481
01:28:02,543 --> 01:28:03,877
I don't know
why she was doing it,

1482
01:28:03,879 --> 01:28:05,545
but I was furious that
she was taking it out

1483
01:28:05,547 --> 01:28:07,047
on our daughter.

1484
01:28:07,615 --> 01:28:09,349
And then I snapped.

1485
01:28:09,550 --> 01:28:11,618
I went crazy, Mike.

1486
01:28:11,753 --> 01:28:13,720
I must have killed
Zach and Sadie,

1487
01:28:13,722 --> 01:28:15,622
but I don't remember.

1488
01:28:16,691 --> 01:28:18,759
I don't remember anything.

1489
01:28:19,360 --> 01:28:22,362
I don't even know
which one I killed first.

1490
01:28:22,364 --> 01:28:23,363
It's just a blank.

1491
01:28:23,365 --> 01:28:26,600
The first thing I remember
is waking up in the airport.

1492
01:28:26,968 --> 01:28:28,368
You blacked out?

1493
01:28:29,037 --> 01:28:31,371
That can count
as temporary insanity.

1494
01:28:32,040 --> 01:28:34,508
Well, I have a new lawyer.
He's filing an appeal.

1495
01:28:35,310 --> 01:28:38,378
It's powerful.
But it makes no sense.

1496
01:28:38,380 --> 01:28:40,514
Even if MaryJane had wanted
to kill Madison,

1497
01:28:40,516 --> 01:28:42,049
she would have
had the entire day.

1498
01:28:42,051 --> 01:28:43,517
Why would she wait
for you to get home

1499
01:28:43,519 --> 01:28:44,918
so you could catch her
in the act?

1500
01:28:44,920 --> 01:28:47,421
Either she's calculating
or she's out of her mind.

1501
01:28:47,423 --> 01:28:48,922
You can't have it both ways.

1502
01:28:48,924 --> 01:28:51,591
The only thing that
makes sense is a break-in.

1503
01:28:51,726 --> 01:28:53,026
You came home,

1504
01:28:53,028 --> 01:28:55,662
you found everyone dead,
you panicked.

1505
01:28:55,797 --> 01:28:57,464
You thought someone
was trying to frame you.

1506
01:28:57,799 --> 01:29:00,667
So you dumped the bodies
and you went on the run.

1507
01:29:01,069 --> 01:29:02,969
But somebody else
killed them.

1508
01:29:02,971 --> 01:29:04,404
Is that possible?

1509
01:29:04,539 --> 01:29:06,073
Maybe.

1510
01:29:06,607 --> 01:29:08,542
No, it's not.

1511
01:29:08,810 --> 01:29:10,010
None of those stories
hold water

1512
01:29:10,012 --> 01:29:12,346
because they're
all fucking lies.

1513
01:29:14,015 --> 01:29:15,682
You killed them,
you sick fuck.

1514
01:29:16,017 --> 01:29:17,818
You killed all of them.

1515
01:29:18,886 --> 01:29:21,521
Your lawyer called me
for the appeal.

1516
01:29:21,523 --> 01:29:23,657
He asked me to be
a character reference
for you.

1517
01:29:24,025 --> 01:29:25,459
The first thing
I tell the judge is

1518
01:29:25,461 --> 01:29:26,660
look out for the lies.

1519
01:29:26,994 --> 01:29:28,795
Look out
for temporary insanity.

1520
01:29:29,464 --> 01:29:32,699
Look out for self-defense.
Look out for intruder.

1521
01:29:32,900 --> 01:29:34,568
Look out for every wet-eyed

1522
01:29:34,570 --> 01:29:36,636

he serves up.

You didn't have to finish it.
But you did.

1529
01:29:56,457 --> 01:29:58,592

help yourself.

1530

01:30:07,836 --> 01:30:09,536

1534
01:30:10,405 --> 01:30:11,805
One person is.

You, Mike.

your publishers promised us
a Q and A.

1555
01:31:35,957 --> 01:31:37,057
I know there are
a lot of folks

1556
01:31:37,059 --> 01:31:38,692
with questions.
Isn't that right?

Yes?

Mr. Finkel, do you think
he'll kill again,

I doubt it.
He's locked up.

1561

Will they have
to restrain him?

No.

you place him on a list of

CHRISTIAN: Mr. Finkel,

1568
01:32:04,852 --> 01:32:06,720
may I ask you something?

1569
01:32:14,729 --> 01:32:16,863
Do you ever regret
contacting him?

1570
01:32:19,600 --> 01:32:20,800
What do you mean?

1571
01:32:21,602 --> 01:32:23,870
Well, it seems to me
that Christian Longo

1572
01:32:23,872 --> 01:32:25,739
has lost his liberty,

1573

but hearing you read today,

1574
01:32:27,876 --> 01:32:29,676
I was just wondering

1575
01:32:29,678 --> 01:32:31,278
what you might
have lost as well.
