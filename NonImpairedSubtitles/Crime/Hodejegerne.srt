1
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:32,650
Rule No. 1: Make sure you know everything
of those you visit.

2
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:36,749
2: Never use more than ten minutes.

3
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:42,350
For each minute increases the chance of
someone comes home unexpectedly.

4
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:47,150
3: Do not leave DNA.

5
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:56,150
4. Do not waste your time
to obtain an expensive copy.

6
00:00:56,500 --> 00:01:02,150
Even with the banal simple forgeries
it takes weeks before it is discovered.

7
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:06,849
5: Sooner or later one of two things
have to happen.

8
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,149
For a work of art so valuable
that you do not have to worry about anything.

9
00:01:11,300 --> 00:01:13,950
Or you get caught.

10
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:45,749
My name is Roger Brown.
I is 1.68.

11
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:50,550
You do not need a psychologist to understand
that it must be compensated.

12
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:55,149
My house, for example.
Tariff: 30 million.

13
00:01:55,300 --> 00:02:00,549
I do not like it, and has not
afford it. But she loved it.

14
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:03,749
How often do you have a girlfriend
which opens the gallery?

15
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:10,950
I said it was an inheritance. Something I had to say.
But I have just inherited bad genes.

16
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:14,950
There has been a laborious process
to find the truth.

17
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:19,449
If someone like me get what he wants,
only one thing:

18
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:24,750
Money.
A lot of money.

19
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:35,149
But there is one thing
Diana wants more than anything else.

20
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:41,150
And that's just the thing
I do not want to give her.

21
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:46,250
- Is not she cute?
- Cute.

22
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:53,450
Diana Power Eliassen is
one of the beautiful, tall, smart.

23
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:58,750
Those who are used to make love.
Those who take it for granted.

24
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:03,350
The NOK of men would give her that.
Men who are higher than 1.68.

25
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:14,150
But soon it's my turn.
My opportunity. I can feel it.

26
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:21,450
In the meantime, I play loud. For the
he who does not play, do not win.

27
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,550
- What are you going tomorrow?
- Why?

28
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:31,950
We are invited to dinner.

29
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:36,750
- We are invited to dinner?
- Yes.

30
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,850
- Are you talking about with others?
- There is one I want you to meet.

31
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:45,849
This ends now.
I am sincerely sorry.

32
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,049
- Let now be...
- No. Lotte...

33
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:52,950
- The two of us are not.
- Can you keep up?

34
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:06,549
- An impressive resume, Lander.
- Thank you.

35
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:10,849
Yes, I think I am
the right man for the Pathfinder.

36
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:16,350
- What about your life outside of work?
- Is it?

37
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:21,250
You should then here in Oslo. On SkÃ¸yen.
And is married to...?

38
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:24,850
Camilla. Been married for nine years.
Two children. They go to school.

39
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:29,550
Jobs-she?
- Yes. In a law office downtown.

40
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:32,849
- Who is the home of a child is sick?
- She.

41
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,149
- No maid?
- No.

42
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:36,749
- Dog?
- No.

43
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:39,850
- Allergic?
- No.

44
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:54,950
How much is your reputation
head worth?

45
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:57,950
My reputation?
What do you mean?

46
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:02,849
The plant is designed by Julian Opie.
Worth a quarter of a million.

47
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,049
- Do you art in the price range?
- Yes, actually.

48
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:09,749
A lithograph by Munch.
Brooch.

49
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:13,850
Can you say what it is worth
just by looking at it?

50
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:18,449
This consists of circles and lines.
Monotone coloring, without texture.

51
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:25,150
Anything that makes it worth the quarter
million, is the artist's reputation.

52
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:29,050
- And the same applies to managers?
- Quite right.

53
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:36,149
And that is why
you are not going to get this job.

54
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:42,750
- What?
- Oh my God, you searched for it myself.

55
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:48,650
- What else could I do?
- Won someone to tell us about you.

56
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:52,250
Left as if you did not know about it
when we contacted you.

57
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:56,049
Everything is a game, Lander.
Listen now...

58
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:59,849
Pathfinders Chairman
and controller come in the morning.

59
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,250
I want you to meet them.
Listen politely.

60
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:06,450
So you explain why
you are no longer interested.

61
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:12,049
- They will perceive me as junk.
- No. As ambitious.

62
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:15,150
As someone who knows his own value.

63
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:22,649
- Lander, this is your opportunity.
- Ability?

64
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:25,850
Let me build your reputation.

65
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:32,250
I will promise you a job
as fivefold salary within two years.

66
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:35,249
How can you promise that?

67
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:41,949
Because I have never given a customer
a recommendation he has not followed.

68
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:45,450
- But how?
- The answer begins with "r".

69
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:50,150
- RenommÃ©...
- My whole career is built on it.

70
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:55,450
Hello.

71
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:01,649
You have an interview with Jeremiah
Lander and Pathfinder in the morning at. 12.

72
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:05,349
- The information is on file.
- Yes. Great.

73
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:10,349
Your wife's supposed to open gallery
Now this weekend, and I was wondering...

74
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:14,450
- Is it possible to get there?
- Are you invited?

75
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:17,749
- Yes, I'm there?
- Are you?

76
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:23,049
I have received an invoice for 357000
for renovation of Kasper Hansen Street.

77
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:29,549
Votes. I have helped Diana with
expenses. She opened the gallery on Friday.

78
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:34,849
You have to cut consumption.
You can go bankrupt at any time.

79
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,249
I'm working on it.

80
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:40,949
I must tell you
how serious the situation is.

81
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:44,549
You have overdrawn card
with several hundred thousand...

82
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:48,549
I have another phone here.
I'll call later.

83
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:55,150
You have a candidate.
Jeremiah Lander, lives in SkÃ¸yen.

84
00:07:56,400 --> 00:08:01,449
- Yes. We got him. When?
- A meeting of the Alfa in the morning at. 12.

85
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:04,749
- No one home?
- No. His wife works in the city.

86
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:08,150
We meet about twenty.

87
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,449
Receiver in Gothenburg
was to have fifty percent.

88
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:44,349
Ove Kjikerud would be 20% for
to disconnect the alarm, get the art -

89
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:46,849
And run to Sweden with it.

90
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,449
To hire him in Tripolis was something
of the smartest thing I had done.

91
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:54,749
Although I was left with 80000
80000!

92
00:09:54,900 --> 00:09:59,049
It was not until the next
quarterly installments on the house.

93
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:02,150
Something had to happen.

94
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:10,050
Hello.
Thank you for coming.

95
00:10:22,300 --> 00:10:25,949
- It looks very good.
- Not half has come yet.

96
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:32,149
- But I'll not have to meet...
- Hey, it's very nice.

97
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:34,949
- Congratulations. Fantastic show.
- Thank you.

98
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:38,549
There has been something wild today.
I can not tell it now.

99
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:42,350
- But I want you to meet him.
- Hitting who?

100
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,650
- This is my husband. Roger Brown.
- Clas Greve.

101
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:08,349
Clas has just moved here.
From the Netherlands.

102
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:15,650
Hello, are you going?
No, the kids just brighten up.

103
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:21,050
- What brings you to Norway? Work?
- I inherited my grandmother's apartment.

104
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:23,449
- She was Norwegian?
- Yes.

105
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:28,949
I have retired me early.
I'll put the apartment in order.

106
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:31,649
Retired?
From what?

107
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:34,849
I was a director of a uniform
technology business.

108
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:39,349
We work primarily with GPS.
Shall we...?

109
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:43,349
- Hollandsk? Not HOTE, right?
- Yes, exactly.

110
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:48,649
Did not they just acquired by
a large American company? Amtech?

111
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:52,549
- You work yourself in the industry?
- No.

112
00:11:52,700 --> 00:11:56,049
- Why did you leave?
- Let me not bore you with the job talk.

113
00:11:56,200 --> 00:12:02,149
I work in the recruitment industry.
You bored me with a job talk.

114
00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:04,949
- Do you know the Pathfinder?
- Of course. Our competitors.

115
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:07,849
Small.
Skilled.

116
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:12,149
I have to go.
Have a good evening.

117
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:15,650
Clas...
Pathfinder seeks new boss.

118
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:19,049
One that can withstand
takeover attempts by foreign countries.

119
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:21,749
- Shall we take a meeting?
- Sorry.

120
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:26,149
A lunch. Monday at. 12.
We can talk about something else.

121
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:29,349
Arts, renovation,
Polish workers...

122
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:32,349
I write down
the name of a good restaurant.

123
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:35,950
You do not take no for an answer?

124
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:41,349
A parting gift
for long and faithful service?

125
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:45,050
No, I stole it.

126
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:51,550
When we meet.
Say hello to your charming wife.

127
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:06,549
- This is my husband.
- Roger Brown.

128
00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:09,849
Broad-lock, NCIS.
- You have seen on TV.

129
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,550
- He investigates art thefts.
- Do not murder?

130
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:18,150
We insert all resources
on this. We must stop it.

131
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:22,650
- Are you in the art industry?
- No. I work as a headhunter.

132
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:27,650
- In the recruitment industry. Alfa.
- One of the partners, that is.

133
00:13:27,900 --> 00:13:31,349
I gave your wife a compliment
for the exclusive earrings.

134
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:35,450
- She said they were a gift from you.
- Yes.

135
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:41,250
Yes, the best of us
good bonus schemes.

136
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:45,650
I wish
that we had it in my industry as well.

137
00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:49,549
Barring? From VG.
Could we have a picture?

138
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:52,350
Sure.

139
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:14,850
Roger?
Will you?

140
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:25,049
See here. The search for
the kalydonske boar, by Rubens.

141
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:28,250
Stolen by Germans
in Antwerp in 1941.

142
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:32,349
Since it has been missed.
Do you know how it all fits now?

143
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:38,549
- No.
- Clas Greve apartment in Oscars gate.

144
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:43,250
The grandmother had a secret relationship
to a German officer during the war.

145
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:46,450
Then he was arrested,
and shot a few days.

146
00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:52,650
- She panicked to be discovered.
- And then she hid the painting?

147
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:58,450
- But it is not true.
- Overall, the Germans on the reproductions?

148
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:04,049
- Why did he tell you?
- He would have an independent valuation.

149
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:08,849
Asked if I knew someone
who could do it.

150
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:13,649
Clas Greve has a genuine Rubens painting
in his apartment?

151
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:15,949
- Here in Oslo?
- Yes.

152
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:20,849
I offered to contact
an art museum, to be moved there.

153
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:28,049
Next week. Such a picture stack the
not only in a safety deposit box.

154
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:34,150
- How much do you think it is worth?
- Tens of millions. Maybe 100

155
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:46,249
Do you know what I think?
I think that we two should celebrate.

156
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:53,150
- Celebrate what?
- That you have started your own gallery.

157
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:59,350
- And us.
- Thank you for supporting me, Roger.

158
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:04,749
- Everything will be fine.
- What do you mean?

159
00:16:04,900 --> 00:16:08,850
The fact that we have two
should start thinking about the future.

160
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:26,150
- Yes, it's Ove.
- We have a candidate.

161
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:30,850
- Do you know what time it is?
- Clas Greve, Oscars gate 25

162
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:34,650
- Is there a count?
- His name is Count.

163
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:41,050
Ove?

164
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:46,150
- Ove? What happens?
- Sorry. Natasha is here.

165
00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:49,349
- What did you say?
- Meet me at the house tomorrow.

166
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:55,250
No, not tomorrow! It's Saturday.
I have her all weekend.

167
00:16:55,900 --> 00:17:01,249
This is great, Ove.
We only have a couple of days on us.

168
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:04,150
The time-a!
- Okay, okay.

169
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:20,450
- So nice you are.
- Good morning.

170
00:17:26,100 --> 00:17:28,949
- You...?
- Yes?

171
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:32,349
What you said yesterday
to think ahead...

172
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:37,250
Includes the sound of
small shuffling feet in the hallways here?

173
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:43,150
- Maybe so.
- Do not say maybe, Roger.

174
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:47,650
I said yesterday
that everything would work out.

175
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:53,449
- I will have that conversation now.
- Agree, but I will in an important meeting.

176
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:59,249
Do you think I'm stupid?
You should be in an important meeting?

177
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:01,850
Come in a position tonight?

178
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:06,550
I must go.
We called later.

179
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,849
- What are you so afraid?
- Nothing.

180
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:14,849
Dogs.
And you, when you are like now.

181
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:18,950
If we are to be childless
the rest of my life, I know.

182
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:22,249
Yes, but now I
in an important meeting.

183
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:25,749
- Have tried to talk about it for 7 years.
- And it will take 7 years.

184
00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:29,550
If you continue
to push on the way!

185
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:34,150
It did not.

186
00:18:34,300 --> 00:18:37,550
You are never going to give me a child.

187
00:18:56,900 --> 00:18:59,949
How many million are we talking about?

188
00:19:00,100 --> 00:19:04,850
- Perhaps up to a hundred.
- A hundred?!

189
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:12,049
It's every time, Ove. I have said
I do not want stuff like that here.

190
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:14,449
You know I always have weapons.

191
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:19,450
At home I have weapons everywhere.
Can now a Green in every room.

192
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:24,050
You should also get one.
Sooner or later they come.

193
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:28,650
Ok. You go to Gothenburg
and obtain a reproduction.

194
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:32,949
We must have a well. I have lunch
with Clas Greve on Monday...

195
00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:35,349
Ove?

196
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:41,150
- I told you to get in the car!
- But I have no fire!

197
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:45,350
Out!
We have a meeting here!

198
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:50,650
Women...

199
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:55,849
As I would say before I was interrupted
of a Russian prostitute...

200
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:01,950
At lunch Monday I will find out
when the apartment is empty.

201
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:05,949
- You go to Sweden immediately. Now.
- Okay.

202
00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:10,650
- No, fuck. I'm busy.
- Busy?

203
00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:16,649
Natasha is here.
I'll make a new movie with her.

204
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:19,849
I have arranged everything
with the guys at work.

205
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:23,450
- You movies her?
- I must have something to watch.

206
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:32,850
I just turn on the alarm,
then roll the cameras.

207
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:36,350
- So she does not know that you are filming?
- No.

208
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:39,849
And the guards are sitting
and watching the two of you...?

209
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:43,950
I have no camera
directed against the bed!

210
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:50,250
They will see that she is undressing,
and some fingering. That's it.

211
00:20:52,700 --> 00:20:55,150
She has cut itself.
Nice.

212
00:20:55,900 --> 00:21:00,350
The rest is for the parlor.
Fat, or?

213
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:06,549
There are only a few days
the image moves.

214
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:10,650
- Do you understand how big this is?
- She is here twice a season.

215
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:13,849
You will
to be left with millions.

216
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:19,650
For that much money you can buy her.
For the rest of your life.

217
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:03,949
I take it without crayfish jelly,
and dressing on the side.

218
00:22:04,100 --> 00:22:08,450
Are you in Oslo now, or
it will be much oscillation in the future?

219
00:22:10,300 --> 00:22:15,149
Three and a half million,
plus stock options.

220
00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:19,950
You take things a bit for granted.
Remember that you are a foreigner.

221
00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:22,349
Norwegian companies want...

222
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:26,450
Your method works for sure
at most.

223
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:29,450
But we have been
in this situation before.

224
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:33,050
- You literally savlet...
- Savlet?

225
00:22:33,300 --> 00:22:37,849
You dribbled when we met at the gallery.
It made you right in.

226
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:41,950
The problem was only
I was not interested in the job.

227
00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:47,649
But I found that renovation
the apartment is not as exciting.

228
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:54,150
So if it's ok for you...
Let's just drop the play.

229
00:22:56,300 --> 00:22:59,250
Ok.
I give myself.

230
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:04,950
- But I need more information.
- Do you play squash?

231
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:17,649
- Married?
- Signs.

232
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:19,349
- Children?
- Unfortunately.

233
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:23,749
- Dog?
- Yes. I have.

234
00:23:23,900 --> 00:23:26,549
- In Amsterdam.
- Quarantine?

235
00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:30,250
I will fly down and get it tomorrow.

236
00:23:36,100 --> 00:23:38,850
It's hard in the GPS industry?

237
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:45,049
- Your back.
- Now... It is from the military.

238
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:48,449
I joined as a 18-year-old.

239
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:52,149
After a few years
I ended in a special unit...

240
00:23:52,300 --> 00:23:55,050
- Specialized in what?
- Tracking.

241
00:23:55,300 --> 00:23:58,449
- Tracking...?
- People.

242
00:23:58,600 --> 00:24:00,949
Missing.
Wanted.

243
00:24:01,100 --> 00:24:04,949
- And the technology was provided by HOTE?
- Exactly.

244
00:24:05,100 --> 00:24:08,749
They made microscopic transmitters.

245
00:24:08,900 --> 00:24:14,649
I had suggestions for improvements.
So they recruited me.

246
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:18,049
- Where are the scars from?
- Bolivia.

247
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:22,649
- Were you tortured?
- No, I dropped off on time.

248
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:28,950
- Sounds like something from a movie.
- No, you have not seen the movie.

249
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:32,749
- When can we meet with Pathfinder?
- Anytime.

250
00:24:32,900 --> 00:24:35,649
- When are you back?
- The day after tomorrow.

251
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:38,750
So we take it then.

252
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,550
Diana?

253
00:29:59,300 --> 00:30:05,450
Hey, it's Diana. I can not
answer the phone now. Have a nice day.

254
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:04,649
- Hey.
- As of late you are.

255
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:09,450
- I tried to call you on your mobile.
- I must have missed it in the gallery.

256
00:31:11,100 --> 00:31:14,950
- Was it something important?
- No.

257
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:19,850
I just wanted to hear your voice.

258
00:31:20,100 --> 00:31:24,750
You are cute. Come and sit down,
it has just started a film.

259
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:28,850
No.
I...

260
00:31:29,900 --> 00:31:33,749
I'm completely finished.
I go to bed.

261
00:31:33,900 --> 00:31:36,950
Ok.

262
00:31:41,700 --> 00:31:46,149
We developed a gel that contains
hundreds of transmitters per ml.

263
00:31:46,300 --> 00:31:49,349
It sticks to everything,
and are impossible to remove.

264
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:51,549
You mean Trace.

265
00:31:51,700 --> 00:31:56,849
The weakness is that Trace is
sensitive to such. mud.

266
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:00,049
This I know
of experience as a soldier.

267
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:03,450
When you are in, excuse me,
the world's butt hole...

268
00:32:03,700 --> 00:32:06,750
When you are dependent on
that the equipment works.

269
00:32:10,900 --> 00:32:15,349
That you come by Brown,
is clearly of great importance.

270
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:21,150
Ultimately, it is he
which must make its recommendation.

271
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:23,750
A moment only.

272
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:45,650
- Very good.
- Thank you. Well home.

273
00:32:47,300 --> 00:32:49,649
When writing your recommendation?

274
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:53,650
- We must make a decision first.
- What do you say?

275
00:32:53,800 --> 00:33:00,149
There are several candidates. We must
assess the overall picture. You will be notified.

276
00:33:00,300 --> 00:33:04,650
Have we been at the same meeting?
It could not have gone better.

277
00:33:04,900 --> 00:33:10,450
- They were ready to write the contract.
- When you're in the good way.

278
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:21,349
Hello.
You travel to Gothenburg tonight, Ove.

279
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:27,150
The image is sold
as quickly as possible.

280
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:45,550
Hello.
I have to talk to you.

281
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:49,450
- Don't see me like this.
- Can you give me two seconds?

282
00:34:04,700 --> 00:34:10,749
I apologize if it's my fault
that you have it so, but we have...

283
00:34:10,900 --> 00:34:15,650
It's really not
something more to talk about.

284
00:34:16,200 --> 00:34:22,750
- Do you need money?
- I miss you so much.

285
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:26,950
Lotte...

286
00:34:27,700 --> 00:34:31,650
Lotte...
Do not contact me again.

287
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:52,950
- You look tired.
- Thank you.

288
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:59,750
- Is there anything?
- No.

289
00:35:00,100 --> 00:35:03,349
- Is there a lot at work?
- Yes, a little.

290
00:35:03,500 --> 00:35:07,050
I had a meeting with Pathfinder
in the day. And Clas Greve.

291
00:35:07,300 --> 00:35:10,250
- Okay?
- No.

292
00:35:12,500 --> 00:35:15,650
- He does not get the job?
- Absolutely not.

293
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:18,949
Tomorrow I'll call the other agencies.

294
00:35:19,100 --> 00:35:22,949
I will ensure
that he did not get a job in Norway.

295
00:35:23,100 --> 00:35:25,549
Why?

296
00:35:25,700 --> 00:35:29,549
Did you find your mobile, by the way?

297
00:35:29,700 --> 00:35:32,450
- You had lost your mobile.
- Yes.

298
00:35:32,700 --> 00:35:35,149
- In Gallery?
- Yes.

299
00:35:35,300 --> 00:35:39,750
- So good. More wine?
- Yes, thank you.

300
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:45,150
Ove?

301
00:36:45,300 --> 00:36:49,950
Ove...

302
00:38:13,100 --> 00:38:16,150
- Hey.
- What are you doing here?

303
00:38:18,500 --> 00:38:21,650
You came down here and did not come out.

304
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:24,350
- I was worried.
- For what?

305
00:38:24,500 --> 00:38:27,649
Nothing.

306
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:31,250
- You Roger...
- Yes?

307
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:35,050
Have a nice day at work, then.

308
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:54,050
I love you.

309
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:31,850
Ove!

310
00:40:43,900 --> 00:40:48,850
- Ove, where do you live?
- Natasha...

311
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:51,849
Ove...
Ove!

312
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,550
Where are...?

313
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:13,349
Ove, what happened in the garage?

314
00:41:13,500 --> 00:41:16,550
Did you see anyone?

315
00:41:21,600 --> 00:41:24,049
Answer me now.

316
00:41:24,200 --> 00:41:28,750
So what happened?
Was there anyone there?

317
00:41:29,500 --> 00:41:32,450
- Natasha...
- What?

318
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:42,150
What the hell is going on here?

319
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:08,049
Ove, what is the password?

320
00:42:08,200 --> 00:42:10,649
- The password for the alarm.
- Natasha...

321
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:14,349
We need to disable the alarm.
What is the password?

322
00:42:14,500 --> 00:42:19,550
- What is my password!
- That is what I say! Natasha!

323
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:23,450
Sj or ch?

324
00:42:37,100 --> 00:42:39,650
Ove...

325
00:42:41,500 --> 00:42:46,150
Ove, how's it going?

326
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:49,949
- What happened?
- You put yourself in a syringe in the car.

327
00:42:50,100 --> 00:42:53,149
A syringe?

328
00:42:53,300 --> 00:42:56,349
- You have been lucky.
- Lucky?!

329
00:42:56,500 --> 00:43:00,450
You got the needle in the knee.
The toxin did not properly inserted.

330
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:04,249
- Do you fuck up?
- This is about something else!

331
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:07,449
Diana has a relationship with Clas Greve.

332
00:43:07,600 --> 00:43:13,650
He kills you not
because if he fucks your wife!

333
00:43:17,300 --> 00:43:22,850
Call 1-13, then!
- We shall have no police up here!

334
00:43:23,400 --> 00:43:27,549
Please, Roger.
I've got to the hospital.

335
00:43:27,700 --> 00:43:31,049
- Or so I dauer.
- I collect milk.

336
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:37,350
Milk neutralizes poison. They had
done nothing else in the hospital.

337
00:43:53,800 --> 00:43:56,350
- Call.
- Do not do anything stupid.

338
00:43:56,600 --> 00:43:59,650
When I do it myself.

339
00:44:01,700 --> 00:44:04,650
Now we take it very quiet...

340
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:51,450
Roger.
I must speak with you.

341
00:46:27,600 --> 00:46:33,150
I have spent most of my
adult life to track down people.

342
00:46:34,300 --> 00:46:37,250
Microscopic transmitters.

343
00:48:27,200 --> 00:48:30,150
Good day.
Have imagined a short trip to the cabin.

344
00:48:30,400 --> 00:48:33,449
- I thought it was Kjikerud.
- No.

345
00:48:33,600 --> 00:48:37,250
- It is his car.
- Yes.

346
00:48:38,800 --> 00:48:44,349
- If you do not like that business man?
- I got fired.

347
00:48:44,500 --> 00:48:48,649
- Can I put the car in the barn?
-500 A day.

348
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:52,550
You can get free
down the road, you know.

349
00:49:01,600 --> 00:49:07,650
If you touch the tractor,
I have a compensation!

350
00:49:35,500 --> 00:49:41,450
- Makan to the race that is here today!
- I will only visit the Roger Brown.

351
00:49:41,700 --> 00:49:46,549
- Is he the business man?
- Yes.

352
00:49:46,700 --> 00:49:49,949
- What are you doing with him?
- We have a deal.

353
00:49:50,100 --> 00:49:54,050
I have nothing to do with
what you are doing, but...

354
00:49:54,300 --> 00:49:57,950
He has not invited you
for coffee and cakes at the cabin.

355
00:49:58,200 --> 00:50:00,349
In the cabin?

356
00:50:00,500 --> 00:50:07,950
Since it is my site, is perhaps
some compensation just and reasonable.

357
00:53:23,800 --> 00:53:25,750
Search!

358
00:55:17,200 --> 00:55:20,250
Hello?

359
00:58:33,500 --> 00:58:36,149
Who are you?

360
00:58:36,300 --> 00:58:39,150
Oh, oh hell...

361
00:59:46,500 --> 00:59:49,350
You will not be up, you!

362
00:59:50,200 --> 00:59:54,749
- Has anyone asked for me?
- No. Come and lie down.

363
00:59:54,900 --> 00:59:59,350
Apart from the police.
They sit and wait for you at a time.

364
01:00:00,700 --> 01:00:04,350
I said you should
eat breakfast first.

365
01:00:27,300 --> 01:00:32,449
Because if you manage to turn into
larynx, are you good at fighting.

366
01:00:32,600 --> 01:00:34,949
Ever heard of co-daw-ying?

367
01:00:35,100 --> 01:00:41,650
Not so strange. Do you know how many
martial arts that exist? 3000.

368
01:01:08,900 --> 01:01:11,650
Egyptian shuffle game...

369
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:24,150
Stand still!

370
01:01:24,300 --> 01:01:28,250
Sunded, I got him!

371
01:01:28,700 --> 01:01:31,250
Olav Sunded from NCIS.

372
01:01:31,500 --> 01:01:35,049
You are suspected of
killing of farmer Sindre Aa.

373
01:01:35,200 --> 01:01:39,950
Join us Kjikerud,
we will rest inside.

374
01:01:40,600 --> 01:01:43,649
You erOve Kjikerud?

375
01:01:43,800 --> 01:01:45,950
Yes.

376
01:02:06,600 --> 01:02:10,749
- Where are we?
- Elverum police for questioning.

377
01:02:10,900 --> 01:02:14,850
Hope you work,
so I can go to Oslo tomorrow.

378
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:20,349
- Message to all patrol cars.
- Both, in other words.

379
01:02:20,500 --> 01:02:22,549
Bravo 3-0 match.

380
01:02:22,700 --> 01:02:25,649
Egmon Karlsen
reviewed the trailer stolen.

381
01:02:25,800 --> 01:02:29,750
- Sounded Karlsen sober look like?
- Not entirely, no.

382
01:02:29,900 --> 01:02:34,950
Call Bear pub.
It is probably parked there.

383
01:02:35,300 --> 01:02:40,449
- Why did you kill the farmer, then?
- I have no idea what you're talking about.

384
01:02:40,600 --> 01:02:43,649
Mercedes was your
the barn to Sindre Aa.

385
01:02:43,800 --> 01:02:47,449
- You drove his tractor into the ditch.
- I have never heard the name.

386
01:02:47,600 --> 01:02:53,349
- No trailer outside the Bear pub.
- I have more important things to do now.

387
01:02:53,500 --> 01:02:56,249
Check behind the Kiwi.

388
01:02:56,400 --> 01:02:58,349
Sorry.

389
01:02:58,500 --> 01:03:02,450
- We have several witnesses...
- Where is the course, fuck me!

390
01:03:03,100 --> 01:03:09,450
Call Egmon. I see the trailer.
Surely the son who has stolen borrowed it.

391
01:03:09,600 --> 01:03:13,050
What do you do now, Basking shark?

392
01:03:18,800 --> 01:03:22,250
As I said.
We have many proofs.

393
01:03:22,500 --> 01:03:24,650
And the stubborn refusal.

394
01:03:24,900 --> 01:03:30,550
Then you tell me details,
for I fall right out here.

395
01:03:33,500 --> 01:03:37,249
Neighbors to find you in the ditch
next to the tractor.

396
01:03:37,400 --> 01:03:41,350
We developed a gel that contained
hundreds of transmitters per ml.

397
01:03:42,200 --> 01:03:45,249
It sticks to everything,
and are impossible to remove.

398
01:03:45,400 --> 01:03:47,750
I love you.

399
01:03:53,300 --> 01:03:55,650
- We have to leave.
- No.

400
01:03:55,900 --> 01:04:01,450
He's going to kill us.
He has smeared transmitters in my hair!

401
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:07,450
- Calm down!
- He has smeared transmitters in my hair!

402
01:04:09,300 --> 01:04:12,649
- He will kill me!
- Calm down!

403
01:04:12,800 --> 01:04:15,850
We must get out!

404
01:10:43,800 --> 01:10:46,849
Hey, it's Diana.

405
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:48,849
Hello?

406
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:52,450
Hello?
Roger, is that you?

407
01:11:30,700 --> 01:11:33,749
After this
we go to Forensic.

408
01:11:33,900 --> 01:11:38,950
Then we take a look
the house of Kjikerud.

409
01:11:42,600 --> 01:11:47,150
"I am a single girl in Gjovik.
You are the most sexy cop. "

410
01:11:47,500 --> 01:11:53,550
"And the smartest. Will you meet me?
I'm with at the most. "

411
01:12:06,700 --> 01:12:08,950
What the hell happened here?

412
01:12:16,500 --> 01:12:18,549
Lotte, wait.

413
01:12:18,700 --> 01:12:24,850
- What are you doing here? What has happened?
I need help. Please.

414
01:12:27,700 --> 01:12:33,149
- Do not poke yourself in this.
- Into what?

415
01:12:33,300 --> 01:12:38,450
When they ask, do not lie.
Just say that I was here.

416
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:44,050
Just say that I forced myself into.

417
01:12:44,500 --> 01:12:47,749
What has happened?

418
01:12:47,900 --> 01:12:51,850
Wait here.
I'll get something to clean it with.

419
01:12:57,100 --> 01:13:00,250
Do you have a case?

420
01:13:26,400 --> 01:13:29,450
Lotte, who do you contact?

421
01:13:29,700 --> 01:13:34,650
- Get the phone!
- Stop.

422
01:13:34,800 --> 01:13:39,449
- "Roger lives. He is in the apartment".
It's not who you think...

423
01:13:39,600 --> 01:13:44,849
- What is going on?
- I do not know!

424
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:48,049
It's not my fault!
- What is going on?

425
01:13:48,200 --> 01:13:51,649
- Please...
- What is it Greve want with me?

426
01:13:51,800 --> 01:13:56,349
- He will have a job in the Pathfinder.
- Man does not kill for a job!

427
01:13:56,500 --> 01:13:59,150
It's about billion.

428
01:13:59,300 --> 01:14:05,650
They have worked with it since they found
that Pathfinder searched president.

429
01:14:05,900 --> 01:14:08,749
- Who are 'they'?!
- Clas.

430
01:14:08,900 --> 01:14:12,150
- He still works for HOTE.
- What?

431
01:14:14,400 --> 01:14:18,549
- What?!
- They have huge financial problems.

432
01:14:18,700 --> 01:14:22,849
Amtech requires HOTE provide them
Pathfinder technology.

433
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:28,250
- It was Clas' task.
- Are you insane?

434
01:14:28,800 --> 01:14:33,650
I should learn to recognize,
and then introduce you to him.

435
01:14:33,900 --> 01:14:37,649
He had to add a new plan,
since you would not see me more.

436
01:14:37,800 --> 01:14:40,850
He had to find
a way to meet you.

437
01:14:42,700 --> 01:14:46,149
His grandmother had an old copy
of a Rubens painting.

438
01:14:46,300 --> 01:14:51,550
He made a wild story about
she got it from a German officer.

439
01:14:51,800 --> 01:14:57,150
He told Diana story
and she believed him.

440
01:14:57,300 --> 01:14:59,849
Then he met you.

441
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:06,949
The only thing I did was
to lubricate the transmitters in your hair for you.

442
01:15:07,100 --> 01:15:09,449
Did you know?

443
01:15:09,600 --> 01:15:13,150
Is it you who have smeared
the crap in my hair?!

444
01:15:13,300 --> 01:15:17,650
- Is Diana with it?
- I do not know. I think so.

445
01:15:17,800 --> 01:15:23,550
- You think so?!
It's not that I want this!

446
01:15:27,400 --> 01:15:33,950
I just want away from him.
Can not you help me?

447
01:15:46,300 --> 01:15:50,750
Can I get a glass of water?

448
01:16:20,300 --> 01:16:23,250
Lotte!

449
01:17:16,700 --> 01:17:21,849
The suspect died in the accident along
with three of the four police officers.

450
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:24,650
The last police officer
is still missing.

451
01:17:24,800 --> 01:17:32,150
Divers from the Army is now seeking to
and along the river. So, to Middle East...

452
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:50,050
Diana.

453
01:17:58,300 --> 01:18:01,350
Roger?

454
01:18:01,600 --> 01:18:04,650
What has happened?

455
01:18:12,700 --> 01:18:15,750
Do not look at me like that.

456
01:18:17,700 --> 01:18:22,549
I know why you left.
There is no more between the Classroom and me.

457
01:18:22,700 --> 01:18:26,549
I tried to put it in the garage,
but could not.

458
01:18:26,700 --> 01:18:31,349
- But what do you know...?
- No, I have to say this now.

459
01:18:31,500 --> 01:18:37,449
It was not meant
that it would happen. But you hurt me.

460
01:18:37,600 --> 01:18:40,850
He was so easy to talk to,
and I just...

461
01:18:41,600 --> 01:18:44,650
Did not want no more.

462
01:18:48,400 --> 01:18:55,950
It was wrong.
And I am ashamed of myself that way.

463
01:18:56,700 --> 01:18:59,349
For it is you I want.

464
01:18:59,500 --> 01:19:06,549
If you really believe that we do not
to have children, we do not need it.

465
01:19:06,700 --> 01:19:10,350
I am willing to
to do anything.

466
01:19:14,800 --> 01:19:17,550
You love me, you...

467
01:19:17,800 --> 01:19:22,249
Never stop believing in it.
Promise me that.

468
01:19:22,500 --> 01:19:27,650
- And you did nothing.
- About what?

469
01:19:28,100 --> 01:19:31,350
You knew nothing.

470
01:19:36,200 --> 01:19:40,550
Oh, my God.
What has happened?

471
01:20:10,300 --> 01:20:12,850
Come.

472
01:20:20,600 --> 01:20:24,849
Dog bites are dangerous.
You must get a doctor to look at it.

473
01:20:25,000 --> 01:20:28,950
It fits a little bad right now.

474
01:20:30,200 --> 01:20:33,150
Hold this.

475
01:20:36,200 --> 01:20:40,850
- What are you going to do now?
- I do not know.

476
01:20:44,900 --> 01:20:49,950
They will soon find out
who died in the accident.

477
01:20:50,300 --> 01:20:54,250
I have to remove the evidence.

478
01:20:55,400 --> 01:20:58,450
And then?

479
01:21:01,000 --> 01:21:07,150
I must get away from here.
Restart.

480
01:21:13,700 --> 01:21:17,150
Maybe the two of us could...

481
01:21:27,300 --> 01:21:31,050
I can wait
by saying that it is stolen.

482
01:21:35,900 --> 01:21:39,350
I have to clean them too.

483
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:47,150
Do you love her?

484
01:21:49,700 --> 01:21:52,650
No.

485
01:22:05,100 --> 01:22:08,850
How could you be so fucking stupid?

486
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:15,250
Rane art?
And buy things I need?

487
01:22:18,800 --> 01:22:22,450
Who do you think I am?

488
01:22:36,300 --> 01:22:42,050
You have asked me
what I fear.

489
01:22:47,500 --> 01:22:51,450
And I have been afraid
since the first time I met you.

490
01:22:51,700 --> 01:22:55,849
I have been afraid
that you would leave me.

491
01:22:56,000 --> 01:23:03,550
Afraid that we would have a child that
you would have loved more than me.

492
01:23:05,400 --> 01:23:11,550
And I have been afraid that you
to see who I really was.

493
01:23:12,400 --> 01:23:16,350
And hate it.

494
01:24:26,400 --> 01:24:30,049
- Sorry this Greve.
- It's all right.

495
01:24:30,200 --> 01:24:34,549
Roger Brown is
on an unexpected trip abroad.

496
01:24:34,700 --> 01:24:39,049
- It sounds interesting.
- He had to rescue an important contract.

497
01:24:39,200 --> 01:24:44,349
But you are in safe hands now. The
only formalities remain.

498
01:24:44,500 --> 01:24:47,350
So it will be NOK go quickly.

499
01:24:49,100 --> 01:24:52,349
Hello.
We should replace a fan of B4.

500
01:24:52,500 --> 01:24:59,950
We have gone back and forth across the
day. But this card works not.

501
01:26:17,300 --> 01:26:19,950
Thank you.

502
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:08,650
Hello, boys. Sorry,
but we are a little behind here.

503
01:27:08,900 --> 01:27:13,850
Got just a woman who has
lying dead on the floor heating for 14 days.

504
01:27:14,000 --> 01:27:18,949
- What do you think about this, then?
- Typical car accident damage to both.

505
01:27:19,100 --> 01:27:23,749
- Internal bleeding is the cause of death.
- Where are the peanuts?

506
01:27:23,900 --> 01:27:26,949
It's about a bag of peanuts.
Where is it?

507
01:27:27,100 --> 01:27:29,250
I have not eaten them.

508
01:27:29,500 --> 01:27:34,850
- Has it been compromised here?
- To steal a bag of peanuts?

509
01:29:15,500 --> 01:29:18,850
Who is it?

510
01:29:24,000 --> 01:29:27,649
What the hell is going on here, Roger?

511
01:29:27,800 --> 01:29:33,950
Removes the track? Do you think
you get away with this?

512
01:29:37,800 --> 01:29:40,050
What the heck?

513
01:29:43,800 --> 01:29:48,650
So you did it with the hair?
That's where the transmitters set.

514
01:29:49,000 --> 01:29:52,050
That it was Lotte, who...

515
01:29:53,100 --> 01:29:56,450
- That's why you killed her?
- Does it feel like a loss?

516
01:29:56,700 --> 01:29:58,750
I give you a choice.

517
01:29:59,000 --> 01:30:03,450
Tells you what is going on,
you get a shot in the head.

518
01:30:03,800 --> 01:30:07,950
- Otherwise, you get a bullet in the stomach.
- Have you no feelings about it?

519
01:30:08,400 --> 01:30:11,949
I want to know
about people like you really are.

520
01:30:12,100 --> 01:30:14,449
Such as me?

521
01:30:14,600 --> 01:30:19,450
People who can not love.
Which is without empathy.

522
01:30:19,700 --> 01:30:22,950
- Empathy?
- Yes.

523
01:30:23,200 --> 01:30:27,150
If you want an answer to it,
so look yourself in the mirror.

524
01:30:27,400 --> 01:30:30,449
- I'm not like you.
- Are you not?

525
01:30:30,600 --> 01:30:32,849
No.

526
01:30:33,000 --> 01:30:37,950
- I have loved someone.
- You have loved someone? Diana?

527
01:30:38,500 --> 01:30:41,550
Her you loved?

528
01:30:42,500 --> 01:30:45,250
I'm afraid
that I have sad news.

529
01:30:53,500 --> 01:30:58,850
She says she longs for me.
She wants me.

530
01:31:00,600 --> 01:31:03,050
And I'm only human.

531
01:31:03,300 --> 01:31:07,850
Have you loved someone?
Someone other than the dead dog?

532
01:31:10,000 --> 01:31:14,750
I do not have time for this.
I have an appointment with Diana in the evening.

533
01:31:15,000 --> 01:31:18,950
You pick the hair. You know
I will come after you. Why?

534
01:31:19,400 --> 01:31:23,350
It takes a long time to die of stomach shots.
You will beg me to kill you.

535
01:31:23,600 --> 01:31:26,849
So I ask you one final time:
Why am I here?

536
01:31:27,000 --> 01:31:30,350
Why are you smiling?
Why am I here?

537
01:31:30,900 --> 01:31:33,450
Stop that!

538
01:31:50,000 --> 01:31:53,950
Do you know why I smiled, Clas?

539
01:31:54,300 --> 01:31:58,049
Because you just proved
that Diana loves me.

540
01:31:58,200 --> 01:32:02,050
She did not come to you
because she wanted you.

541
01:32:02,300 --> 01:32:06,949
She came because she was
replacement cartridges in your gun.

542
01:32:07,300 --> 01:32:11,650
She has replaced bullets in your gun.
To IÃ, sskudd.

543
01:32:12,400 --> 01:32:16,150
Or what do you call it in Denmark?
Blanks?

544
01:32:16,400 --> 01:32:20,350
- What the hell are you talking about?
- She hates you.

545
01:32:21,600 --> 01:32:24,650
She wants you to die.

546
01:32:29,700 --> 01:32:32,750
But I'll give you one chance.

547
01:32:35,900 --> 01:32:39,850
I have no idea how many balls
Diana managed to change.

548
01:32:44,000 --> 01:32:46,850
It is not like you, Clas...

549
01:33:54,300 --> 01:33:57,250
Is it over?

550
01:34:00,500 --> 01:34:02,650
Yes.

551
01:34:15,800 --> 01:34:20,650
I might not myself,
but others. The gamble I.

552
01:34:21,000 --> 01:34:27,850
Welcome to this press conference
under the auspices of the Oslo police and NCIS.

553
01:34:28,900 --> 01:34:31,549
I had prepared myself well.

554
01:34:31,700 --> 01:34:36,849
Service pistol from the crash would
Police find the Kjikeruds bedside.

555
01:34:37,000 --> 01:34:43,250
The same gun killed Lotte Madsen,
as the press called Greves mistress.

556
01:34:43,500 --> 01:34:51,150
How "art thieves" Ove Kjikerud and
Clas Greve had killed each other...

557
01:34:51,400 --> 01:34:55,950
Had a whole world
been joined on the internet.

558
01:34:59,000 --> 01:35:02,049
They also wanted to find out
that the gun fired Greve, -

559
01:35:02,200 --> 01:35:05,849
- Consistent with the ball
as perforated trained head.

560
01:35:06,000 --> 01:35:09,050
He should never have taken the gun.

561
01:35:09,300 --> 01:35:12,250
We can present
a breakthrough in the case.

562
01:35:12,500 --> 01:35:17,449
I had done everything right.
But one thing I could not change.

563
01:35:17,800 --> 01:35:20,950
Ove was already dead
when I shot Greve.

564
01:35:22,200 --> 01:35:25,550
But Broad lock is
Norway's most famous detective.

565
01:35:25,800 --> 01:35:30,849
Unresolved issues are not his style.
Especially not after VG called him:

566
01:35:31,000 --> 01:35:34,050
"The man who gets to Norway
to sleep well at night. "

567
01:35:34,300 --> 01:35:37,549
Because he's accomplished?
Absolutely.

568
01:35:37,700 --> 01:35:43,849
But mostly because he has understood what
get an up and forward. And what is it?

569
01:35:44,000 --> 01:35:46,849
It has been
a long and complicated investigation.

570
01:35:47,000 --> 01:35:49,249
The answer begins with "r".

571
01:35:49,400 --> 01:35:52,649
Reputation.

572
01:35:52,800 --> 01:35:57,549
There is one on television, and provides
a text messages from strange women.

573
01:35:57,700 --> 01:36:02,349
We think they celebrated the theft,
and it came completely out of control.

574
01:36:02,500 --> 01:36:10,149
It ends with the torture
a dog, and kill the farmer.

575
01:36:10,800 --> 01:36:12,750
That is correct.

576
01:36:17,500 --> 01:36:20,950
Have a nice day.
Both of them.

577
01:36:25,100 --> 01:36:28,249
- We are ready.
- Tell the candidate about a minute.

578
01:36:28,600 --> 01:36:31,250
Ferdinand...
Thank you.

579
01:36:33,200 --> 01:36:38,650
Hello. We're sorry.
Be so good, his.

580
01:36:38,900 --> 01:36:41,949
I have asked you here
because we are at the end of -

581
01:36:42,100 --> 01:36:47,550
- A long and dramatic hunting
the Pathfinder's new CEO.

582
01:36:47,800 --> 01:36:50,950
Last time it was unrealistic
to get him released from his position.

583
01:36:51,200 --> 01:36:55,050
Without promising too much,
I think I've got him on the plain.

584
01:36:55,700 --> 01:37:00,050
Please welcome... Jeremiah Lander.

585
01:37:00,300 --> 01:37:02,950
Thank you for last.

586
01:37:03,800 --> 01:37:08,149
My name is Roger Brown.
I is 1.68.

587
01:37:08,300 --> 01:37:11,450
And you know what?
That is more than enough.
