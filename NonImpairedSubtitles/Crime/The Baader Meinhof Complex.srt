1
00:00:44,428 --> 00:00:48,785
Hey! Come on,
Mouse, out of the water!

2
00:00:49,068 --> 00:00:53,937
Oh, Mama. A little longer.
- I said out! Right now!

3
00:01:01,428 --> 00:01:04,261
You're both completely blue!

4
00:01:07,308 --> 00:01:10,266
They're pretty.
- Who are they?

5
00:01:10,468 --> 00:01:14,461
The Shah of Iran and his wife.
- Ah, my three Graces.

6
00:01:14,588 --> 00:01:18,547
Papa, what is a Shah?
- Sort of like a king.

7
00:01:18,748 --> 00:01:22,946
A Shah may cut off the
head of anyone he dislikes.

8
00:01:23,068 --> 00:01:27,141
Don't tell the children such rubbish.
- The Truth is Simple.

9
00:01:27,268 --> 00:01:31,147
With such power, there is no joke.
- Hallo, Klaus.

10
00:01:31,268 --> 00:01:35,102
And? How goes the Revolution?
- Right now, it's on holiday.

11
00:01:35,428 --> 00:01:38,898
Will you to come to our party tonight?
- Certainly.

12
00:01:39,028 --> 00:01:41,064
Well, until then.
- Yes.

13
00:01:50,868 --> 00:01:54,065
Ah, Klaus, not now.

14
00:01:54,188 --> 00:01:57,817
Yeah, sure, OK.
- It makes me nervous.

15
00:01:57,948 --> 00:02:01,782
Yes, but not very much.
So cheer up.

16
00:02:02,628 --> 00:02:05,586
The royal couple landed at 11.05...

17
00:02:05,748 --> 00:02:09,707
in a private plane
at Tempelhof airport.

18
00:02:10,028 --> 00:02:14,419
Empress Farah wore a fox-fur coat
and a black and white hat.

19
00:02:14,548 --> 00:02:16,300
Stefan!

20
00:02:17,108 --> 00:02:18,257
Stefan!

21
00:02:18,508 --> 00:02:22,706
The Shah inspected an
honour-guard of the Berlin Police.

22
00:02:35,468 --> 00:02:38,028
Stefan, dear friend.

23
00:02:38,388 --> 00:02:41,346
Fresh off the presses.

24
00:02:41,548 --> 00:02:42,742
OK.

25
00:02:47,388 --> 00:02:49,458
For all to hear.

26
00:02:49,588 --> 00:02:52,580
My clever star-journalist wife...

27
00:02:52,708 --> 00:02:57,224
wrote an open letter
to her imperial highness Farah Diba.

28
00:02:57,348 --> 00:03:02,786
Don't make a big deal of it.
- It'll be in the next edition.

29
00:03:03,268 --> 00:03:08,422
5000 of these fliers are
already at the universities.

30
00:03:08,548 --> 00:03:10,300
Very good.

31
00:03:11,028 --> 00:03:15,704
Good day, Mrs Pahlevi. There's a story
in the New Review about life in Iran,

32
00:03:16,588 --> 00:03:20,979
about how hot it gets there,
and how you, like most Persians,

33
00:03:21,108 --> 00:03:24,657
like to holiday on the Caspian coast.

34
00:03:24,948 --> 00:03:28,782
Like most Persians?
Isn't that an exaggeration?

35
00:03:29,068 --> 00:03:33,698
Most Persians are farmers,
and make less than 100 Marks a year.

36
00:03:33,828 --> 00:03:37,980
And half of all Persian
mothers die giving birth.

37
00:03:38,428 --> 00:03:41,465
From hunger, poverty and illness.

38
00:03:41,668 --> 00:03:45,627
And the children work
14-hour days weaving carpets.

39
00:03:45,868 --> 00:03:50,305
Do most of them really holiday
with you at the Caspian seaside?

40
00:03:50,508 --> 00:03:54,467
They write:
"The Shah must have a son. "

41
00:03:54,668 --> 00:03:58,627
Iranian Law is
very strict on that point.

42
00:03:58,828 --> 00:04:02,946
Strange that it seems so
unimportant to the Shah.

43
00:04:03,068 --> 00:04:07,027
And no official statement is made.

44
00:04:07,228 --> 00:04:11,187
That the Minister of Justice
makes no comment.

45
00:04:11,428 --> 00:04:15,501
That unofficial courts
are held in secret.

46
00:04:15,628 --> 00:04:19,587
That torture is allowed
under Persian law.

47
00:04:19,788 --> 00:04:21,824
We do not want to insult you.

48
00:04:21,948 --> 00:04:26,100
But the German public
should not be insulted

49
00:04:26,228 --> 00:04:29,265
with crap like this
story in the New Review.

50
00:04:29,388 --> 00:04:32,346
Faithfully,
Ulrike Meinhof.

51
00:04:52,948 --> 00:04:56,497
Welcome, Pahlevi!
- Princess, Princess!

52
00:05:03,068 --> 00:05:05,502
Farah! Farah Diba!

53
00:05:14,708 --> 00:05:16,061
Murderer!

54
00:05:28,028 --> 00:05:29,984
Are they crazy?

55
00:05:41,268 --> 00:05:43,657
Murderer!

56
00:05:47,588 --> 00:05:51,467
Are you crazy?
What are you doing?

57
00:05:55,548 --> 00:05:58,506
Don't push me, you wanker!

58
00:05:59,748 --> 00:06:01,261
Stop!

59
00:06:03,828 --> 00:06:08,982
Is there a doctor here?
Let us through!

60
00:06:09,228 --> 00:06:13,426
It's out of control here.
Are you stupid? There, the woman!

61
00:06:13,548 --> 00:06:17,507
Can you help us?
We have an injured person here.

62
00:06:21,508 --> 00:06:23,464
What happened?

63
00:07:43,748 --> 00:07:47,297
He was attacking me.
- You are mad?

64
00:07:48,148 --> 00:07:50,708
Let's go.

65
00:08:05,668 --> 00:08:08,501
He needs a physician!

66
00:08:11,308 --> 00:08:16,462
Mrs Meinhof, they were not on
the demonstrators' side. Why?

67
00:08:17,948 --> 00:08:23,659
The right-wing press blamed
the disaster on the students.

68
00:08:24,468 --> 00:08:28,427
Above all the Springer group
tried, in its newspaper,

69
00:08:28,668 --> 00:08:33,025
to label the students as rioters.

70
00:08:33,148 --> 00:08:38,427
"To shout is no longer enough,
now they want blood. "

71
00:08:38,548 --> 00:08:40,539
But the truth is,

72
00:08:40,668 --> 00:08:44,866
the protest proved that
we live in a Police state.

73
00:08:44,988 --> 00:08:49,937
That the Police and the press
went too far in Berlin on June 2nd.

74
00:08:50,068 --> 00:08:54,220
And that the only freedom
here is for the Police.

75
00:08:54,348 --> 00:08:58,136
But Mrs Meinhof, with all respect...
- We all know that Kurras...

76
00:08:58,268 --> 00:09:02,227
...who shot Ohnesorg, will be acquitted.

77
00:09:02,468 --> 00:09:06,427
That is pure demagogy!
That is demagogy.

78
00:09:06,668 --> 00:09:10,741
In America they discuss using
nuclear weapons in Vietnam,

79
00:09:10,868 --> 00:09:14,907
and Israel starts a war of
aggression with the help of the USA.

80
00:09:15,028 --> 00:09:19,067
which is called "preventive war" here.
- Israel has to defend itself.

81
00:09:19,188 --> 00:09:24,342
Then Hitler's attacks on Poland
and Russia were also "preventive".

82
00:09:24,508 --> 00:09:29,901
But you can't say that!
- Mrs Meinhof, I must say...

83
00:09:30,028 --> 00:09:33,418
You must also consider the child.

84
00:09:33,548 --> 00:09:36,699
This woman has nothing worthwhile to say.

85
00:09:36,828 --> 00:09:40,787
The American Imperialist
machine will not stop!

86
00:09:40,948 --> 00:09:44,384
Vietnam, Bolivia and now the Near East.

87
00:09:44,588 --> 00:09:48,422
America has supplied
Israel with weapons for years.

88
00:09:48,748 --> 00:09:52,821
Each warplane, each rocket,
each tank, everything comes from the USA.

89
00:09:52,948 --> 00:09:57,260
Or the western industrial nations.
- They are not the people's friends!

90
00:09:57,388 --> 00:10:01,427
The pigs want to control the
oil fields of the Near East.

91
00:10:01,548 --> 00:10:05,587
It's just shit to them if
many thousands of people die.

92
00:10:05,708 --> 00:10:09,667
I must now go to church.
- You should preach...

93
00:10:09,868 --> 00:10:13,941
that over half the people in the world
do not have enough to eat.

94
00:10:14,068 --> 00:10:18,027
Is it senseless to
preach for a better world?

95
00:10:18,788 --> 00:10:22,337
That those condemned once again must resist!

96
00:10:30,988 --> 00:10:33,821
You should get married soon.

97
00:11:03,788 --> 00:11:05,938
Ulrike! Wait!

98
00:11:08,148 --> 00:11:09,501
Wait!

99
00:11:25,388 --> 00:11:27,344
Finally.

100
00:11:28,828 --> 00:11:31,661
Hello, Baby.
- Well, Kitty?

101
00:11:36,668 --> 00:11:40,502
So, here it is.
I hope it's enough.

102
00:11:51,068 --> 00:11:54,026
Will it be enough?
- Why?

103
00:11:56,908 --> 00:11:58,864
So...
- Hey!

104
00:12:00,428 --> 00:12:04,467
I think... we don't want to
torch the department store

105
00:12:04,588 --> 00:12:08,706
We need hard action to show
that wanker that we're not kidding!

106
00:12:08,828 --> 00:12:13,219
And if people are still inside?
- Don't talk like a homo, Tussi.

107
00:12:13,348 --> 00:12:18,058
Who'd be there at night?
And if there is: a bigger headline!

108
00:12:18,188 --> 00:12:22,500
Are you insane?
- Andreas knows what he's doing.

109
00:12:42,708 --> 00:12:45,666
You're under arrest!
- Police! Halt!

110
00:12:46,108 --> 00:12:48,099
Idiot!
- Police!

111
00:12:48,228 --> 00:12:52,938
Handcuff them!
- You're under arrest for arson.

112
00:12:53,068 --> 00:12:54,740
Good morning.

113
00:12:57,468 --> 00:13:01,620
Under continuous bombardment
by American warplanes...

114
00:13:01,748 --> 00:13:06,822
of alleged Vietcong positions,
civilian populations suffer the most.

115
00:13:06,948 --> 00:13:11,066
In the USA, particularly at
universities, these pictures led...

116
00:13:11,188 --> 00:13:15,261
the students to rise up in protest.
In the Federal Republic...

117
00:13:15,388 --> 00:13:19,586
thousands of students protest,
such as these, in Berlin.

118
00:13:19,708 --> 00:13:24,463
The Anarchist Rudi Dutschke
mobilizes the resistance.

119
00:13:24,748 --> 00:13:27,945
Comrades, we don't have much time.

120
00:13:28,068 --> 00:13:33,745
In Vietnam the bombs fall every day.
We must stand up for them.

121
00:13:34,308 --> 00:13:39,462
As Che said: It is not a matter of
wishing success to the victim of aggression,

122
00:13:39,588 --> 00:13:43,137
but of sharing his fate.

123
00:13:43,268 --> 00:13:47,659
One must accompany him
to his death or to victory.

124
00:13:54,428 --> 00:13:57,022
From German ground...

125
00:13:57,148 --> 00:14:01,107
From German ground
wars are still prepared.

126
00:14:01,308 --> 00:14:04,425
From German ports and miltary bases...

127
00:14:04,548 --> 00:14:10,305
The American military
wages the Vietnam war!

128
00:14:14,108 --> 00:14:16,941
We cannot allow this!

129
00:14:17,268 --> 00:14:20,340
We must stop the German government

130
00:14:20,468 --> 00:14:25,462
helping this Imperialist war in Viet Nam!

131
00:14:33,148 --> 00:14:36,106
Are you Ulrike Meinhof?
- Yes.

132
00:14:36,308 --> 00:14:40,142
We are forced to take illegal action...

133
00:14:40,468 --> 00:14:43,426
let sabotage and blockades start now!

134
00:14:47,988 --> 00:14:50,946
We protest against this conference!

135
00:14:51,428 --> 00:14:55,387
Ladies and Gentlemen,
this conference is terminated!

136
00:16:07,788 --> 00:16:10,621
Are you Rudi Dutschke?

137
00:16:10,868 --> 00:16:14,702
Yes, I am.
- You dirty communist pig!

138
00:16:44,228 --> 00:16:47,186
I am dead. Let me live.

139
00:16:57,428 --> 00:17:00,386
Father. Mother.

140
00:17:00,948 --> 00:17:04,736
Soldier... Soldier...

141
00:17:14,868 --> 00:17:18,417
He's down here!
He went down here somewhere.

142
00:17:18,668 --> 00:17:21,626
Search the building site.
- Covering!

143
00:17:42,828 --> 00:17:46,787
You are surrounded!
Come out with hands up!

144
00:17:47,228 --> 00:17:49,662
I can't stand communists.

145
00:17:50,308 --> 00:17:54,381
Rudi Dutschke is in critical condition
after two hours of emergency surgery today.

146
00:17:54,508 --> 00:17:58,581
Only one of the two bullets
could be removed from his head.

147
00:17:58,708 --> 00:18:03,782
Spontaneous demonstrations
have sprung up across the country,

148
00:18:03,908 --> 00:18:07,867
blaming the Springer publishing house
for inciting the assasination attempt.

149
00:18:08,228 --> 00:18:11,584
Springer, Murderer!

150
00:18:42,428 --> 00:18:46,387
I didn't think this was your style!

151
00:19:01,428 --> 00:19:04,386
Attention, this is the Police!

152
00:19:04,908 --> 00:19:08,867
You are trespassing
on private property.

153
00:19:09,028 --> 00:19:11,986
Leave the area immediately!

154
00:19:13,468 --> 00:19:14,901
Come along!

155
00:19:19,068 --> 00:19:23,983
Frau Meinhof? What are you doing here?
Release her. Frau Meinhof is a journalist.

156
00:19:27,668 --> 00:19:29,704
Dresden!

157
00:19:29,828 --> 00:19:31,580
Hiroshima!

158
00:19:32,348 --> 00:19:34,100
Vietnam!

159
00:19:35,108 --> 00:19:36,860
Dresden!

160
00:19:37,788 --> 00:19:39,540
Hiroshima!

161
00:19:40,348 --> 00:19:42,100
Vietnam!

162
00:19:49,468 --> 00:19:52,426
Che Guevara was captured...

163
00:19:52,628 --> 00:19:57,224
and then murdered by the CIA...

164
00:19:58,908 --> 00:20:02,867
Yesterday Martin Luther King
was assasinated...

165
00:20:03,108 --> 00:20:06,145
...Senator Robert Kennedy was shot...

166
00:20:06,268 --> 00:20:10,341
Republican Richard Nixon becomes
the 37th President of the USA

167
00:20:10,468 --> 00:20:15,019
Soldiers sealed off the street
and fired into the crowd.

168
00:20:15,948 --> 00:20:20,100
One of the first Soviet vehicles
into Czechoslovakia...

169
00:20:20,228 --> 00:20:24,506
The students call the protests
in Paris cultural revolution.

170
00:20:24,628 --> 00:20:27,540
The state calls it anarchy.

171
00:20:27,708 --> 00:20:31,781
The more I hear of this shouting,

172
00:20:31,908 --> 00:20:35,867
the clearer it becomes - we need
to ensure the rule of law in this country.

173
00:20:36,468 --> 00:20:40,063
In agreement with Andreas Baader
I want to make a statement.

174
00:20:40,188 --> 00:20:44,978
He and I placed the bomb
in the department store.

175
00:20:46,348 --> 00:20:50,580
We did it to protest
against the indifference...

176
00:20:50,868 --> 00:20:54,827
of people who sit and watch
the genocide in Vietnam.

177
00:21:00,028 --> 00:21:05,580
We believe that speech
without action is wrong.

178
00:21:08,748 --> 00:21:11,581
Order, please!

179
00:21:14,308 --> 00:21:16,868
Order, please!

180
00:21:18,108 --> 00:21:19,860
Mr Mahler?

181
00:21:19,988 --> 00:21:24,982
Could you do us the honour of
allowing the court to share the joke?

182
00:21:25,108 --> 00:21:30,102
The judges can hardly understand
the ideas Ms Ensslins and Mr Baader.

183
00:21:30,228 --> 00:21:35,256
Otherwise they would take off their
robes and join the protests themselves.

184
00:21:35,388 --> 00:21:36,946
Order!

185
00:21:37,548 --> 00:21:40,108
Order, please!

186
00:21:42,508 --> 00:21:47,502
Mr Ensslin, your daughter wanted to
address your generation with her act.

187
00:21:47,708 --> 00:21:50,666
Whatever they wanted to do,
it comes to this:

188
00:21:50,868 --> 00:21:56,738
Our generation experienced,
in the name of the people,

189
00:21:57,068 --> 00:22:01,027
concentration camps, Jew hate, genocide,

190
00:22:01,388 --> 00:22:06,057
and now will not permit
reformation, a new beginning.

191
00:22:08,388 --> 00:22:12,700
How do you explain that,
with the world as it is?

192
00:22:12,828 --> 00:22:18,221
It's amazing that Gudrun, who considers
things very rationally and intelligently,

193
00:22:18,628 --> 00:22:20,961
by one foolish act, experienced

194
00:22:25,468 --> 00:22:28,426
a holy self implementation.

195
00:22:28,588 --> 00:22:32,627
I feel that she created
something free with her act.

196
00:22:32,748 --> 00:22:36,787
Even in the family.
I feel liberated.

197
00:22:36,908 --> 00:22:41,459
Of a tightness and a fear,
that had ruled my life before.

198
00:22:42,708 --> 00:22:45,666
It took the fear from me.

199
00:22:50,668 --> 00:22:54,627
<i>Throw a single stone,
and that is a crime.</i>

200
00:22:54,868 --> 00:22:59,419
<i>Throw a thousand stones
and that is a political action.</i>

201
00:22:59,988 --> 00:23:03,583
<i>Set fire to a car,
that is a crime.</i>

202
00:23:03,708 --> 00:23:08,862
<i>Burn a thousand cars,
and that is a political act.</i>

203
00:23:10,988 --> 00:23:14,947
<i>Protest is saying:
"I disagree with this and that. "</i>

204
00:23:15,548 --> 00:23:18,506
<i>Resistance is saying:</i>

205
00:23:18,668 --> 00:23:22,627
<i>"I will put a stop to this and that. "</i>

206
00:23:25,388 --> 00:23:31,145
Thanks for making this possible.
- It's OK. I've read your work.

207
00:23:36,748 --> 00:23:41,776
Can one stop the genocide in Vietnam by
burning down a department store?

208
00:23:41,908 --> 00:23:46,982
No. It was an error,
as I said in court.

209
00:23:48,748 --> 00:23:53,185
It was an act of rebellion.
But it was pointless...

210
00:23:53,308 --> 00:23:56,266
while Fascism grows
as strong as it was under Hitler.

211
00:23:56,388 --> 00:24:01,542
This time we offer resistance.
Out of responsibility before history.

212
00:24:01,828 --> 00:24:06,777
People, here and in America,
must eat. Must eat and buy.

213
00:24:07,348 --> 00:24:13,298
But they do not think
about it, they just consume.

214
00:24:14,188 --> 00:24:18,147
We wanted them to
think about it a little.

215
00:24:18,348 --> 00:24:21,340
So you burned down
a department store?

216
00:24:21,468 --> 00:24:25,541
I will never resign myself
to doing nothing. Never.

217
00:24:25,668 --> 00:24:28,978
If people try to murder us,
like Ohnesorg und Dutschke,

218
00:24:29,108 --> 00:24:33,659
then we will shoot back.
That is only consistent.

219
00:24:34,228 --> 00:24:37,061
Do you really mean that?

220
00:24:37,228 --> 00:24:41,938
All over the world
comrades fight with guns in hand.

221
00:24:42,068 --> 00:24:46,027
We must become soldiers.
- We fight already.

222
00:24:46,228 --> 00:24:50,187
And if the fascists throw
you into prison for it?

223
00:24:50,388 --> 00:24:53,266
Such victims they'll have.

224
00:24:53,388 --> 00:24:58,826
Or do you believe that you'll change
something with your grand theory?

225
00:25:02,908 --> 00:25:05,866
Sorry, I didn't mean to be cruel.

226
00:25:25,348 --> 00:25:29,182
Is Baader or Gudrun here?
- Gudrun is up there.

227
00:25:37,068 --> 00:25:41,027
Oh! Sorry!
- Hello. Who are you?

228
00:25:42,748 --> 00:25:46,297
I'm Peter Boock.
- And I'm Gudrun.

229
00:25:46,828 --> 00:25:49,388
Are you a runaway?

230
00:25:49,588 --> 00:25:52,546
Youth Training Centre.
- There are others here, too.

231
00:25:52,748 --> 00:25:56,707
They'll soon come and join us.
They gather up here.

232
00:25:58,188 --> 00:26:02,147
Can I bathe afterwards?
- Bathe now.

233
00:26:02,868 --> 00:26:06,827
No water wasting here.
Tell me about yourself.

234
00:26:14,188 --> 00:26:18,147
Where did you get that?
- Youth Training Centre. Lucky City.

235
00:26:31,868 --> 00:26:35,827
I heard about it.
You nearly burned the place down.

236
00:26:36,148 --> 00:26:39,982
The bastards nearly
beat us to death for it.

237
00:26:41,108 --> 00:26:45,226
If they catch me,
no more day leave till I turn 21.

238
00:26:45,348 --> 00:26:49,261
Don't let it worry you.
You're part of our family now.

239
00:26:49,388 --> 00:26:53,745
You were locked up for arson, too.

240
00:26:53,868 --> 00:26:56,826
But we are free on appeal.

241
00:26:57,108 --> 00:27:01,067
And at least we can make an appeal.

242
00:27:01,348 --> 00:27:04,385
And so we make it.
- And if they find me?

243
00:27:04,508 --> 00:27:09,457
Andreas and I must disappear,
if our appeal is rejected.

244
00:27:15,388 --> 00:27:19,347
Tell me... do I see right?
You trying to fuck my old lady?

245
00:27:28,828 --> 00:27:30,784
Well, Kitty?

246
00:27:32,428 --> 00:27:33,781
Hey.

247
00:27:38,508 --> 00:27:41,341
Andreas, this is Peter.

248
00:27:42,908 --> 00:27:48,062
What happened to you?
- The staff at Lucky City.

249
00:27:49,748 --> 00:27:52,945
Then we should tear them some new arseholes.

250
00:27:53,068 --> 00:27:55,628
Great leather jacket!

251
00:27:57,908 --> 00:28:00,263
Here, it's yours.

252
00:28:00,548 --> 00:28:05,144
Let's go! To Darmstadt!
- We don't have enough cars.

253
00:28:05,268 --> 00:28:08,544
Then we'll steal two or three.

254
00:28:47,188 --> 00:28:50,146
Only the gun cures the rigidity.

255
00:28:54,468 --> 00:28:57,028
Go on, fire at will!

256
00:28:57,468 --> 00:28:59,424
Fire at will!

257
00:29:14,268 --> 00:29:18,102
We have made
extraordinary efforts...

258
00:29:18,388 --> 00:29:24,258
to understand what the people want.
We want more democracy.

259
00:29:24,508 --> 00:29:28,740
These words of the new Federal Chancellor
Willy Brandt as he takes office...

260
00:29:28,868 --> 00:29:33,783
reconcile the students and end
nearly 3 years continuous riots.

261
00:29:33,908 --> 00:29:38,823
The reform promises to create
peace at the universities, and the basis

262
00:29:38,948 --> 00:29:43,817
to bring the outside parliamentary
opposition into the democratic process.

263
00:29:43,948 --> 00:29:47,907
And what do you believe?
- I think the worst is over.

264
00:29:48,148 --> 00:29:52,903
The protest movement
has lost its momentum.

265
00:29:53,028 --> 00:29:58,102
Groups which feel existentially oppressed

266
00:29:58,228 --> 00:30:00,788
will not hesitate

267
00:30:01,428 --> 00:30:07,378
to bomb whatever parts of
society they see as oppressive.

268
00:30:16,948 --> 00:30:19,906
Over here!
Can't you see us?

269
00:30:21,228 --> 00:30:22,581
Gudrun?

270
00:30:23,628 --> 00:30:27,018
Andreas... Hallo, Astrid.
- Mister Counsellor.

271
00:30:29,868 --> 00:30:33,827
And? What are your plans?
What's next for you?

272
00:30:34,188 --> 00:30:38,261
Can't you talk normally? Do you
really think Interpol are after us?

273
00:30:38,388 --> 00:30:42,097
...because those jerks
in Frankfurt rejected our appeal?

274
00:30:42,228 --> 00:30:44,981
We're not going back to prison.

275
00:30:45,148 --> 00:30:49,221
Then come to Berlin. Illegally.
We're building up a new group.

276
00:30:49,348 --> 00:30:54,422
We're further along than you'd think.
What have your guys done?

277
00:30:54,548 --> 00:30:58,587
A lot's happened since you've been away.
We have good contacts.

278
00:30:58,708 --> 00:31:02,781
Houses, ID, money, weapons.
We can provide everything.

279
00:31:02,908 --> 00:31:07,663
Yeah, under your leadership.
The illegal underground attorney.

280
00:31:07,788 --> 00:31:11,747
I'm shitting myself.
- Let him finish.

281
00:31:12,108 --> 00:31:16,943
They couldn't steal grandma's puppy!
- That's not the point.

282
00:31:17,068 --> 00:31:20,140
Where's Dutschke now?
- Living in London.

283
00:31:20,268 --> 00:31:23,624
He's crippled, can hardly speak.

284
00:31:23,868 --> 00:31:28,020
Since he was shot, nobody leads
while the struggle goes on.

285
00:31:28,148 --> 00:31:33,302
The struggle would have been won,
if they hadn't screwed it up.

286
00:31:34,468 --> 00:31:39,258
Show us what you're made of.
Steal the purse from granny's bag.

287
00:31:39,388 --> 00:31:42,937
Baby...
- I want to know if he's got the balls.

288
00:31:45,388 --> 00:31:48,346
Or is it all just talk?

289
00:32:14,788 --> 00:32:16,380
Oh, man!

290
00:32:16,828 --> 00:32:20,662
Fucking shit, they're stealing my car!

291
00:32:20,788 --> 00:32:24,747
Hey! Stop!
Fucking spagetti-muncher!

292
00:32:25,188 --> 00:32:30,182
Shit! You dumb bitch,
you left the car open again!

293
00:32:30,308 --> 00:32:34,267
So what? Steal a new one.
- You CUNT!

294
00:32:34,428 --> 00:32:37,181
CUNT! FUCK IT ALL!

295
00:32:38,148 --> 00:32:39,501
WHY?

296
00:32:47,628 --> 00:32:50,586
What are you doing here? Why us?

297
00:32:51,108 --> 00:32:53,941
So call the cops.

298
00:32:57,068 --> 00:32:59,707
Where's Ulrike?
- In bed.

299
00:32:59,828 --> 00:33:02,786
Where's the bedroom?
- Back there.

300
00:33:03,588 --> 00:33:04,941
Wait a minute.

301
00:33:08,028 --> 00:33:10,986
Quiet, you'll wake the children.

302
00:33:31,028 --> 00:33:33,588
We're back.

303
00:33:38,788 --> 00:33:41,985
They're hunting you, you know.
- Big deal.

304
00:33:42,108 --> 00:33:45,657
Can we stay here for a while?
- Yes, of course.

305
00:33:46,508 --> 00:33:50,467
We're recruiting here
in Berlin. And in other cities.

306
00:33:50,668 --> 00:33:54,741
We're expanding the group.
Political conditions change.

307
00:33:54,868 --> 00:33:58,827
What are your plans?
- What kind of stupid question is that?

308
00:33:59,508 --> 00:34:03,057
We take action.
If it goes wrong, too bad.

309
00:34:07,948 --> 00:34:11,782
So, that's it for me.
Where can I crash?

310
00:34:15,228 --> 00:34:18,140
I'll join you in a moment.

311
00:34:18,828 --> 00:34:22,787
What does he mean, though?
- He means exactly what he said.

312
00:34:22,988 --> 00:34:26,947
Andreas does not compromise.
You must understand that.

313
00:34:27,148 --> 00:34:31,107
Andreas is more of a revolutionary
than all the rest of us together.

314
00:34:31,308 --> 00:34:34,141
Sounds great when you're stoned.

315
00:34:36,068 --> 00:34:38,866
You look unhappy.

316
00:34:38,988 --> 00:34:44,016
I saw a film about Youth Homes.
Girls there are treated like shit.

317
00:34:44,148 --> 00:34:50,064
I thought I could do something
about it, but they remain shitty.

318
00:34:50,868 --> 00:34:53,701
But Peggy there escaped.

319
00:34:54,468 --> 00:34:57,426
What we need is a new morality.

320
00:34:57,668 --> 00:35:00,626
You must see that clearly.

321
00:35:00,868 --> 00:35:04,702
Draw a line between you and our enemies.

322
00:35:04,828 --> 00:35:10,141
You must leave the system
and burn your bridges.

323
00:35:10,268 --> 00:35:15,422
And your son?
That you may never see again?

324
00:35:15,988 --> 00:35:20,698
If you're serious,
you have to be prepared to suffer.

325
00:35:24,628 --> 00:35:27,586
Andreas also has a baby daughter.

326
00:35:28,988 --> 00:35:31,946
I could never leave my children.

327
00:35:54,708 --> 00:35:56,061
Shit.

328
00:36:13,668 --> 00:36:18,219
Do you know how fast you were going?
- No. Do you?

329
00:36:19,028 --> 00:36:21,861
Show me your license, please.

330
00:36:27,028 --> 00:36:29,986
And the registration papers, please.

331
00:36:33,068 --> 00:36:36,026
I'm sorry about this, officer.

332
00:36:36,228 --> 00:36:40,062
My friend seems to have thrown them out.

333
00:36:43,628 --> 00:36:46,586
You live in Rome, Mr Hoger?
- Yes.

334
00:36:47,908 --> 00:36:51,457
Your date of birth?
- 14/6 nineteen...

335
00:36:53,228 --> 00:36:54,786
'39.

336
00:36:55,228 --> 00:36:59,665
You don't seem too sure about it.
- It was a long time ago.

337
00:37:04,228 --> 00:37:05,627
And?

338
00:37:05,748 --> 00:37:08,706
They're holding him in Moabit jail.

339
00:37:10,228 --> 00:37:13,777
We have to get him out.
- I'll help.

340
00:37:14,708 --> 00:37:16,664
Me too.

341
00:37:17,228 --> 00:37:20,061
How? Tying sheets together?

342
00:37:20,308 --> 00:37:25,336
You can write about it afterwards.
That's all you're good for.

343
00:37:25,468 --> 00:37:29,507
Perhaps Andreas should
just serve the ten months.

344
00:37:29,628 --> 00:37:34,941
Shit! Freeing Prisoners is
what we're always talking about.

345
00:37:35,068 --> 00:37:40,096
We'll show the pigs what we can do,
if they lock up our people.

346
00:37:40,228 --> 00:37:43,061
We're getting Andy out! Now!

347
00:37:45,988 --> 00:37:49,537
We can't visit him in prison anyway.

348
00:37:50,588 --> 00:37:55,708
You'll be a publisher.
We'll get in with a book contract.

349
00:38:01,748 --> 00:38:03,261
Good day.

350
00:38:03,388 --> 00:38:08,667
This is Dr Gretel Weitemeier,
who will be publishing our book.

351
00:38:08,788 --> 00:38:12,747
Pleased to meet you.
- The pleasure's all mine.

352
00:38:20,628 --> 00:38:23,188
Are you insane?

353
00:38:24,228 --> 00:38:28,187
Man, it only fires tear gas.
Looks real though, eh?

354
00:38:32,228 --> 00:38:35,186
Where did you get that?
- from Gudrun.

355
00:38:35,388 --> 00:38:40,542
We've got a lot of things, now.
- And who is "we"?

356
00:38:43,068 --> 00:38:45,628
I cannot say.

357
00:38:46,068 --> 00:38:50,027
Well, I can:
Gudrun, Astrid, Ingrid.

358
00:38:50,868 --> 00:38:53,826
I bought some Asprin.
- Ulrike.

359
00:38:54,028 --> 00:38:56,861
She's only the decoy.

360
00:38:57,628 --> 00:39:00,586
You told me you
wouldn't be involved!

361
00:39:00,988 --> 00:39:03,946
What is your part? Well?

362
00:39:06,028 --> 00:39:10,067
Mahler arranged for Andreas and I
to visit the Sociological Institute...

363
00:39:10,188 --> 00:39:14,261
to research our book.
- They're allowing him out for that?

364
00:39:14,388 --> 00:39:18,347
With a Police escort, of course.
- That's where we come in.

365
00:39:18,548 --> 00:39:22,939
Inside the Institute,
we stick guns in the cops' faces...

366
00:39:23,068 --> 00:39:26,026
and away runs Baader.
- And you?

367
00:39:26,308 --> 00:39:29,300
I stand back and look surprised. That's all.

368
00:39:29,428 --> 00:39:32,386
Now can we get on with dinner?

369
00:39:33,468 --> 00:39:38,496
But you're all female.
What if they don't take you seriously?

370
00:39:38,628 --> 00:39:43,656
Mahler knows some professionals.
We'll have help. Mahler says...

371
00:39:43,788 --> 00:39:47,827
it'll be a piece of cake.
- I don't believe it.

372
00:39:47,948 --> 00:39:51,907
The cops have real guns,
not like that piece of junk.

373
00:39:54,348 --> 00:39:57,181
This is completely insane!

374
00:39:57,748 --> 00:40:00,581
I have to go through with it.

375
00:40:20,068 --> 00:40:25,062
Mr Baader, in the event of an
escape attempt, we are authorised to shoot.

376
00:40:25,188 --> 00:40:29,625
I want to make sure you know that.
- You needn't worry about it.

377
00:40:43,228 --> 00:40:47,983
I've seen you on TV.
- Hopefully I was interesting.

378
00:40:48,108 --> 00:40:52,499
Yes, very. Anything else you need?
- Thanks, I'll manage.

379
00:41:02,508 --> 00:41:04,578
Hey.
- Hey.

380
00:41:07,228 --> 00:41:09,788
Sit down here.

381
00:41:10,788 --> 00:41:14,337
Can I get a cup of coffee?
- Of course.

382
00:41:19,588 --> 00:41:24,503
Are you married? Do you have any children?
- Yes, wife and child.

383
00:41:32,908 --> 00:41:36,457
So, moving along. We have...

384
00:41:39,108 --> 00:41:43,545
I told you yesterday,
come back after noon today.

385
00:41:43,668 --> 00:41:48,423
The reading room is occupied.
- Then we'll wait here.

386
00:41:48,548 --> 00:41:51,506
It's a long wait.
- We have time.

387
00:41:56,868 --> 00:41:59,826
In the following discussion...

388
00:42:39,628 --> 00:42:43,587
Go, quick. Let's move.
- What do you want here?

389
00:42:45,588 --> 00:42:46,941
Shit!

390
00:42:50,108 --> 00:42:52,941
Hands up!
- Up against the wall!

391
00:43:00,708 --> 00:43:02,664
C'mon, Kitty!

392
00:43:04,428 --> 00:43:06,783
Gudrun! Help me!

393
00:43:09,548 --> 00:43:11,937
Stay down!

394
00:43:57,988 --> 00:44:02,982
According to reports the kidnappers
shot the doorman with tear gas

395
00:44:03,108 --> 00:44:09,024
They overpowered the guards
and released Baader by force of arms.

396
00:44:10,068 --> 00:44:12,104
My God, the children!

397
00:44:14,108 --> 00:44:16,463
Go, children, run.

398
00:44:21,548 --> 00:44:22,901
Quickly.

399
00:44:24,508 --> 00:44:29,536
<i>We say: The uniform-wearer
is a pig, not a human.</i>

400
00:44:29,668 --> 00:44:34,696
<i>And so we treat it as such.
We will not negotiate with them.</i>

401
00:44:34,828 --> 00:44:38,787
<i>It is wrong to talk
at all with these people.</i>

402
00:44:38,988 --> 00:44:44,016
<i>And of course, they may be shot
when we consider it necessary.</i>

403
00:44:44,148 --> 00:44:48,699
<i>The gun makes its statement.
It is possible,</i>

404
00:44:48,988 --> 00:44:53,937
<i>in our actions, our enemies
may occasionally triumph.</i>

405
00:44:54,068 --> 00:44:57,458
<i>But where it is important,
they will not beat us.</i>

406
00:44:57,588 --> 00:45:00,102
<i>Our success will belong to history.</i>

407
00:45:53,388 --> 00:45:57,347
Welcome to the camp!
- The attorney looks like Fidel Castro!

408
00:45:57,788 --> 00:46:01,747
Welcome, Andreas. Hi, Gudrun.
- Which way to Havana?

409
00:46:01,948 --> 00:46:05,907
This is Achmed, the Commander.
This is Gudrun and Andy.

410
00:46:06,028 --> 00:46:09,862
The men sleep here, the women there!
- What?

411
00:46:10,548 --> 00:46:15,576
The rules of the camp.
- Shit on that. We sleep together! There!

412
00:46:24,268 --> 00:46:27,977
What's Ali Baba saying?
- Forget it. Come.

413
00:46:29,668 --> 00:46:33,627
It's all fine. Sleep where you like.

414
00:46:33,868 --> 00:46:35,017
All in this house here.

415
00:46:53,148 --> 00:46:55,867
Fucking shit!

416
00:46:55,988 --> 00:46:59,867
This does not have
anything to do with our job!

417
00:46:59,988 --> 00:47:04,425
We are urban guerrillas, understand?
We don't fight in the desert!

418
00:47:11,348 --> 00:47:15,819
Tell that camel-jockey we
fight against bank guards!

419
00:47:19,868 --> 00:47:21,824
French.

420
00:47:22,508 --> 00:47:26,547
What are they laughing about?
- We're just admiring your trousers.

421
00:47:26,668 --> 00:47:29,626
You've got them a little dirty.

422
00:47:41,508 --> 00:47:47,424
I'll finish you off, you cocksucker.

423
00:47:47,628 --> 00:47:50,938
Baby, leave it.
he's one of us.

424
00:47:51,788 --> 00:47:54,586
He is not one of us.

425
00:47:54,708 --> 00:48:00,340
He's only here because he's
scared of the cops in Germany.

426
00:48:27,341 --> 00:48:30,641
SICILY

427
00:48:46,028 --> 00:48:48,861
You're homesick, right?

428
00:48:52,428 --> 00:48:56,660
Which means you give up.
- These people are fighting a war...

429
00:48:56,788 --> 00:49:00,747
What does our situation
in Germany have to do with it?

430
00:49:01,548 --> 00:49:06,576
You can't force a revolution
there, even with a Kalashnikov.

431
00:49:06,708 --> 00:49:09,541
Germany is just one front.

432
00:49:10,908 --> 00:49:15,936
We fight with comrades everywhere
against injustice and oppression.

433
00:49:16,068 --> 00:49:20,619
I thought you knew that.
- And what about your children?

434
00:49:21,908 --> 00:49:25,867
You live underground.
Why bring them into it?

435
00:49:30,628 --> 00:49:35,702
Sooner or later it'll come out that
I did not participate in the Baader escape.

436
00:49:35,828 --> 00:49:38,786
Then I can go back legally.

437
00:49:39,228 --> 00:49:42,186
I could take care of the children.

438
00:49:45,548 --> 00:49:48,506
That sounds very much like betrayal.

439
00:49:48,748 --> 00:49:51,103
Betrayal? Of whom?

440
00:49:57,988 --> 00:50:00,548
Look after yourself.

441
00:50:28,708 --> 00:50:31,541
What now? Can't we have a little fun?

442
00:50:39,588 --> 00:50:44,025
He won't give us any more ammunition.
- Then we go on strike.

443
00:50:53,588 --> 00:50:58,742
What are they staring at?
- Probably never seen naked women before.

444
00:50:59,468 --> 00:51:02,301
Hey, look who's here.

445
00:51:06,668 --> 00:51:09,626
What does one do with a traitor?

446
00:51:11,468 --> 00:51:14,028
People's court.

447
00:51:18,948 --> 00:51:20,301
What?

448
00:51:21,668 --> 00:51:26,105
He asks us to get dressed.
- Why should we?

449
00:51:26,228 --> 00:51:31,382
Sexual freedom and the fight
against imperialism go together.

450
00:51:31,508 --> 00:51:34,341
He doesn't understand, Baby.

451
00:51:36,108 --> 00:51:39,066
Fucking and shooting are the same!

452
00:51:46,500 --> 00:51:48,467
Abu Hassan is commander
of the whole camp.

453
00:53:31,333 --> 00:53:32,833
Don't worry...

454
00:53:32,888 --> 00:53:34,766
...we'll bring you out.

455
00:54:11,188 --> 00:54:15,147
Hands up!

456
00:54:16,628 --> 00:54:19,461
Don't move!
Get down on the floor!

457
00:54:26,508 --> 00:54:31,582
This is a hold-up!
Get away from the window!

458
00:54:34,948 --> 00:54:36,904
Get down!

459
00:54:38,068 --> 00:54:43,142
In West-Berlin today, a gang robbed
three different banks in 10 minutes.

460
00:54:43,268 --> 00:54:48,217
In Breitenbach Platz, three
masked men and one woman.

461
00:54:48,428 --> 00:54:53,263
At 8.10 AM four men dressed in parkas...

462
00:54:53,468 --> 00:54:56,426
The robbers got away with
approximately 200,000 Marks.

463
00:54:56,748 --> 00:55:00,297
It is believed that the robbers

464
00:55:00,908 --> 00:55:05,857
are militant left-wing extremists.

465
00:55:06,188 --> 00:55:10,545
Detectives found a bag of
ski-masks dumped by the bandits.

466
00:55:10,668 --> 00:55:15,617
They left handbills with the text
"Expropriate from enemies of the people".

467
00:55:25,068 --> 00:55:27,423
217,449.50 Marks.

468
00:55:27,548 --> 00:55:32,258
Not bad for 10 minutes work.
- Ulrike should write a statement.

469
00:55:32,388 --> 00:55:35,221
Make clear that we only
took the money of capitalists.

470
00:55:35,348 --> 00:55:40,297
That only the rich need be worried.
- Yeah, liberal wankers think that's good.

471
00:55:44,308 --> 00:55:48,824
Stupid whore! Can't you
be careful? Shit-for-brains!

472
00:55:48,948 --> 00:55:51,906
And so was the revolution made!

473
00:55:53,188 --> 00:55:56,339
<i>Some say,
Bank robbery is not political.</i>

474
00:55:56,468 --> 00:56:01,542
<i>Revolutionaries in Latin America
call bank robbery "expropriation".</i>

475
00:56:01,668 --> 00:56:04,740
Official Statement
on Bank robbery.

476
00:56:04,868 --> 00:56:08,827
<i>It is politically
right to expropriate.</i>

477
00:56:09,068 --> 00:56:13,141
<i>It is strategically right,
if it finances the revolution.</i>

478
00:56:13,268 --> 00:56:17,307
Your children are gone.
I just heard from Sicily.

479
00:56:17,428 --> 00:56:21,387
The man who took them
even knew the code word.

480
00:56:21,588 --> 00:56:25,706
They're surely already
with your ex, the old fascist.

481
00:56:28,988 --> 00:56:34,904
The Baader-Meinhof group will become
accepted as leaders of the revolution.

482
00:56:35,268 --> 00:56:39,102
What are you doing there?
That's my car!

483
00:56:39,468 --> 00:56:43,746
Yesterday five arrests were made:
Attorney Horst Mahler,

484
00:56:43,868 --> 00:56:46,701
student Peggy Schönau...

485
00:56:47,348 --> 00:56:51,660
In the young woman's handbag,
police found a Belgian pistol.

486
00:56:51,788 --> 00:56:55,827
The charges: possession of guns,
falsification of identity papers,

487
00:56:55,948 --> 00:57:00,180
car theft, burglary,
theft and armed robbery.

488
00:57:00,308 --> 00:57:05,462
In Mühlheim, Dortmund, and Konstanz,
the prisoners face similar charges.

489
00:57:05,708 --> 00:57:08,541
Show me your identity papers.

490
00:57:14,548 --> 00:57:16,504
Get back!

491
00:57:18,988 --> 00:57:21,946
...further threats of violence...

492
00:57:41,188 --> 00:57:46,899
The trial of Astrid Berger began today.

493
00:57:47,148 --> 00:57:50,982
According to a study by
the Allensbacher Institute...

494
00:57:51,308 --> 00:57:55,347
25% of Germans under 30
are sympathetic to the RAF.

495
00:57:55,468 --> 00:58:01,065
That's about 7 million people.

496
00:58:01,228 --> 00:58:05,062
Which makes finding
them a lot more difficult.

497
00:58:05,788 --> 00:58:08,348
Lobster soup.

498
00:58:09,588 --> 00:58:13,547
So we plan to
computerise identity papers.

499
00:58:16,988 --> 00:58:20,947
I'll explain by
giving you an example.

500
00:58:22,268 --> 00:58:27,388
Underground terrorists naturally
hide their identities from authority.

501
00:58:27,508 --> 00:58:29,817
Without the new ID card...

502
00:58:29,948 --> 00:58:33,782
no bank account.

503
00:58:34,068 --> 00:58:38,027
Now they'll find it hard
to rent somewhere to live.

504
00:58:38,908 --> 00:58:42,867
Everything will require
the new cards. Gas, water, electricity.

505
00:58:43,068 --> 00:58:47,107
In Frankfurt alone, 16,000
customers usually pay bills in cash.

506
00:58:47,228 --> 00:58:51,744
We will no longer accept cash.
All customers will have to use their new ID.

507
00:58:51,868 --> 00:58:55,417
No ID: no health care, either.
- And then?

508
00:58:56,068 --> 00:59:00,425
Then we take it further. For example,

509
00:59:00,548 --> 00:59:04,587
No ID: no driving license,
no child support payments.

510
00:59:04,708 --> 00:59:10,066
If everyone has to have an ID,
the last handful who don't: suspects.

511
00:59:10,508 --> 00:59:13,466
That is a mathematical certainty.

512
00:59:15,468 --> 00:59:19,905
In the long term it does
nothing to smash heads.

513
00:59:20,068 --> 00:59:23,458
Or, as some would prefer,
to cut heads off.

514
00:59:23,588 --> 00:59:25,624
Not the police,

515
00:59:25,748 --> 00:59:30,299
but political powers
resistant to change,

516
00:59:30,548 --> 00:59:33,506
allow terrorism to develop.

517
00:59:35,588 --> 00:59:38,546
That is my opinion.

518
00:59:39,748 --> 00:59:43,297
Oh, and say hello to
the minister for me.

519
00:59:50,748 --> 00:59:52,704
Shit!

520
01:00:09,028 --> 01:00:10,984
Floor it!

521
01:00:11,708 --> 01:00:14,268
Halt!

522
01:00:20,348 --> 01:00:24,057
Freeze!
Hands up! You too!

523
01:00:24,348 --> 01:00:27,181
Go! Go! Petra, go!

524
01:00:28,548 --> 01:00:31,108
Drop your weapons!

525
01:00:53,708 --> 01:00:56,268
Kiss my arse!

526
01:01:25,108 --> 01:01:29,659
Stop, girl! Freeze! Hands up!
