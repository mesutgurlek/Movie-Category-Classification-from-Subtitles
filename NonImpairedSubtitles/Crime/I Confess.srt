1
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:11,471
Who's there?

2
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:56,352
Keller.

3
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:58,590
Why are you here this time of night?

4
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:02,275
L... I wanted to pray.

5
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:04,431
Is something wrong?

6
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:06,637
I...

7
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:09,997
Can I help you in any way?

8
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:13,630
- Can I be of any help?
- No one can help me.

9
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:17,429
I have abused your kindness.

10
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:18,953
How?

11
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:24,638
You gave my wife and me
a home, a job, even friendship.

12
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:27,473
I felt you would let me
be your friend.

13
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:32,873
So wonderful a thing for a refugee,
a German, a man without a home.

14
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:36,828
- You will hate me now.
- I don't hate anyone, Keller.

15
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:40,989
You will, after what you
have done for me.

16
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:42,832
You trusted me.

17
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,878
You saw that my wife and I
were not common servants.

18
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:51,308
It was you who found more pleasant
tasks for us, working here in the rectory.

19
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:55,953
It was my wife, working so hard...

20
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:58,273
It breaks my heart.

21
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,795
What is the matter?

22
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:06,113
I must confess to you.

23
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:07,713
I must tell someone.

24
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:14,277
I want to make a confession.

25
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:39,833
I confess to almighty God
and to you, Father, that I have sinned.

26
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,549
- When was your last confession?
- I can't remember.

27
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:45,631
Can you remember approximately?

28
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:51,079
I have killed Mr. Villette.

29
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:04,159
Go on.

30
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:06,197
Villette, the lawyer.

31
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:10,478
I went to his house tonight.
I went to steal his money.

32
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:14,394
I wore a cassock to avoid attention.
He surprised me.

33
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:17,597
He was going to call the police.

34
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:21,799
He was going to call the police.
I tried to stop him.

35
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:26,909
I didn't mean to kill him.
Alma, I'm not a murderer.

36
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:29,355
It was an accident.

37
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:31,670
It was the money.

38
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:35,870
How could I watch you work so hard?

39
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:38,270
I lie awake night after night...

40
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:43,070
...and I think, "All we need is $2000."

41
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:47,552
Alma, with $2000, we can
start a new life.

42
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:49,950
Villette was rich...

43
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:53,800
...but now I cannot keep it.

44
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:59,080
That's what Father Logan told me.
I must give it back. I promised him.

45
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:01,310
Oh, it's so hard, Alma.

46
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:04,790
It's so dangerous.
They will catch me.

47
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:06,916
They will hang me.

48
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:09,116
I cannot.

49
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:11,191
I cannot.

50
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:16,433
Father Logan will go to them.
He will tell them.

51
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:26,869
He will tell them?

52
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:32,638
He cannot tell them
what he heard in confession.

53
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:35,234
The police will come.

54
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:37,630
Why, Alma?

55
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:40,553
Why should they come here?

56
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:43,473
They know nothing.

57
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:47,679
I have told them nothing, have I?

58
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:52,550
- Alma, no one knows.
- Father Logan.

59
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:55,917
He cannot tell them what
he heard in the confessional.

60
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:58,719
Can't you understand that?

61
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:02,272
Otto.

62
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:17,437
- What is it, Alma?
- You're going to the police?

63
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:19,397
What is today, Alma?

64
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:22,358
Isn't it the day when I attend
to Mr. Villette's garden?

65
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:24,750
But he's dead.

66
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:29,391
I always work in Mr. Villette's
garden on Wednesdays.

67
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:32,757
Today is Wednesday, Alma.

68
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:37,879
- Good morning, Father Logan.
- Good morning, Father.

69
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:40,474
Tell me, will it take you and Keller...

70
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:44,679
...much longer to finish
the painting in this room?

71
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:46,068
I don't know.

72
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:50,119
I ask because the smell
makes one quite ill.

73
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:53,670
You know, I read some
advertisement about paints...

74
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:57,879
...and, of course, one shouldn't
judge on so little evidence, but l...

75
00:09:58,040 --> 00:10:00,998
- After you, Father.
- One finds it difficult to believe...

76
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:05,472
...that there are paints with no smell.

77
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:10,868
Do you know of any paints
that do not smell, Father Michael?

78
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:13,190
Do I know...?

79
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:15,718
No, I don't.

80
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:19,429
Well, don't think of it.
It doesn't matter.

81
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:27,789
How fortunate we are
to have Keller with us.

82
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:31,876
The man is clever about everything.
Before he came six months ago...

83
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:35,077
...don't you remember how all
the drains wouldn't work...

84
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:37,629
...and the windows would not open?

85
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:40,872
One can learn a great deal from him.

86
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:45,157
Father Benoit and his bicycle
are in time for breakfast.

87
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:47,550
Good morning, Father Millars,
Father Michael.

88
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:49,358
- Good morning.
- Morning.

89
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:54,355
Seriously, must you keep your bicycle
in the hall, Father Benoit?

90
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:59,958
It doesn't always fall, and I don't
seem to know where else.

91
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:05,148
- It's lucky he doesn't have a horse.
- Would you pass me the butter, please?

92
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:09,199
Mrs. Keller, would you ask your husband
to look at my front tire?

93
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:15,117
- It's flat. Could you, please?
- My husband? But it is Wednesday.

94
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:18,636
- He's not here.
- Thank you, no.

95
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:22,755
On Wednesdays, he attends
to Mr. Villette's garden.

96
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:27,830
Then will you tell him
when he comes back, please?

97
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:32,312
Yes, Father, I'll tell him
when he comes back.

98
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:36,678
Now, now, Father Benoit,
you should learn how to patch a tire.

99
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:40,193
One should be able
to take care of one's possessions.

100
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:43,079
One has a face,
one would shave it.

101
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:45,959
- One has a...
- Excuse me, please.

102
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:32,956
Good morning, Father.
Monsieur Villette's been murdered.

103
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:35,471
Good morning.

104
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:47,078
- Good morning, Father.
- Good morning.

105
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:49,071
- I had an appointment here.
- Appointment?

106
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:50,753
With Villette? Well, he's dead.

107
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:53,036
Yes, I know. Is there anything I can do?

108
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:56,510
Well, perhaps Mr. Larrue would
like to see you. Come in, Father.

109
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:03,236
Mr. Larrue, sir. Father here says
he had an appointment with Villette.

110
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:06,119
I'll be with you in a moment.
Hello, Father.

111
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:10,114
- I believe I've met you before, haven't I?
- Yes, I'm from St. Marie.

112
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:12,999
- Yes. How is Father Millars?
- Father Millars is fine.

113
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:15,469
Good. You had an appointment
with Villette?

114
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:17,358
- Yes.
- Anything special?

115
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:19,875
- No.
- You've heard what's happened.

116
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:22,429
Father, Keller works
at the rectory, doesn't he?

117
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:25,194
Yes. He and his wife work there.

118
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:28,557
The poor devil is terrified
at the moment, Father.

119
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:31,350
Forgive me,
but I've forgotten your name.

120
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:33,351
- Logan.
- Father Logan.

121
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:36,034
You don't mind if we call on you today,
maybe tomorrow?

122
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:40,193
Perhaps we'd like to know what your
appointment with Villette was all about.

123
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:45,271
Murphy, get Keller.
He's the man who found the body.

124
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:51,358
- Mr. Larrue. No fingerprints.
- All right.

125
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:54,353
This was on his desk.
The keys were in his pocket.

126
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:57,353
Five hundred dollars.
It does not look like robbery, sir.

127
00:13:57,520 --> 00:13:59,397
They usually take the lot.

128
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:03,838
- You work at the rectory at St. Marie's?
- Yes.

129
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,231
Good. Now, how did
you find the body?

130
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:09,960
On Wednesdays, I work
in Mr. Villette's garden.

131
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:14,511
This morning, I arrived
as usual at 8:30. I came inside...

132
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:17,717
- You have a key?
- No. The door was open.

133
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:20,076
- That frightened me.
- An open door?

134
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:23,232
- Why should that frighten you?
- The door was always locked.

135
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:26,956
I went in, and there he was.

136
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:29,634
I could see that he was dead.

137
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:32,314
- I wanted to run.
- Run?

138
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:37,634
There I was, a man without
a country, alone, discovering a murder.

139
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:41,431
I thought of the police.
I'm always afraid of the police.

140
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:46,037
- That's a German fear, this fear.
- There's nothing to be afraid of.

141
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:50,398
- Step outside for a moment.
- Yes. Thank you, sir.

142
00:14:56,360 --> 00:15:00,831
- Villette's been murdered.
- He's dead? I can't believe it.

143
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,513
We're free.

144
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:34,829
Good morning.
Is my husband in the chamber?

145
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:39,232
Yes, madame. Mr. Grandfort
is speaking now. A very stormy debate.

146
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:41,391
That is the understatement of the year.

147
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:44,154
The honorable member
has used every known cliché...

148
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:47,118
...except perhaps "curb your dog,
keep your city clean."

149
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:49,840
Equal salary for female schoolteachers...

150
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,150
...would bring disaster
to our whole economy.

151
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:55,198
Except to the economy
of female schoolteachers.

152
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:58,591
- Mr. Speaker!
- At this point of the discussion...

153
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:02,958
...I adjourn the House
until this afternoon at 3:00.

154
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:15,714
Ruth, my dear,
what a charming surprise.

155
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:18,633
- Pierre, take me to lunch.
- Of course.

156
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:22,110
Feeling better, then? This morning,
you seemed rather depressed.

157
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:25,113
- Was I?
- Yes, and not only this morning.

158
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:28,750
- I don't seem depressed now, do I?
- No.

159
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:36,358
The tire wasn't flat after all.

160
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:47,550
Of course, you and Keller
know what you're doing.

161
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:50,917
Personally, I would have preferred
an old-fashioned white.

162
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:52,638
- That's what it is.
- Is it?

163
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:54,119
At least it's supposed to be.

164
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:57,113
- Oh, Mr. Keller, good morning.
- Good morning, Father.

165
00:16:57,280 --> 00:17:00,829
You're back early, aren't you?
Is Mr. Villette's garden flourishing?

166
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:03,232
Mr. Villette is dead, Father.

167
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:06,358
- Dead?
- He was murdered, Father.

168
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:10,559
What? Did you hear that,
Father Logan? How dreadful.

169
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:15,236
I discovered the body.
I called the police.

170
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:19,071
Then they came and asked me
a lot of questions.

171
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:21,993
A lot of people were outside the house.

172
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:25,596
Then the inspector told me I could leave.

173
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:29,676
What a terrible thing.

174
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:32,354
A very terrible thing.

175
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:39,558
Father, why did you come
to Villette's house this morning?

176
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:43,476
Father, I must speak to you.

177
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:47,598
I know what you must think of me...

178
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:50,593
...but I can't give myself up. I can't.

179
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:53,433
They would hang me.

180
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:58,230
Hasn't God forgiven me, thanks to you?
But the police never would.

181
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:00,914
I don't know what you're
talking about.

182
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:03,958
But it was I who confessed to you.
It was my confession.

183
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:08,957
I want you to speak to me about it.
You must tell me what to do.

184
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:11,395
I can't give myself up.

185
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:14,313
You must tell me some other way.

186
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:18,155
There is nothing I can add
to what I've already said.

187
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:20,038
Aren't you human?

188
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:23,078
Haven't you ever been afraid?

189
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:24,673
You are so good.

190
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:27,918
It's easy for you to be good.

191
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:30,116
Have you no pity for me?

192
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:33,158
- Otto.
- Oh, Alma.

193
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:37,199
Otto, Father Benoit asked earlier...

194
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:40,909
...would you please
mend the tire on his bicycle?

195
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:44,558
But the tire wasn't flat
after all, Alma.

196
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:50,998
I don't see why you're so damn solemn
about this case, Larrue.

197
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:54,755
Anyway, why do you come
and worry me after lunch?

198
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:57,195
I've always had the greatest
admiration for you.

199
00:18:57,360 --> 00:19:01,035
You have, in the past, been faced
with tremendously difficult cases...

200
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:04,590
...all of which you have solved
with remarkable skill.

201
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:07,797
And now, here you have
a case in which there are no clues...

202
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:11,749
...no fingerprints,
no motives, no suspects.

203
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:14,434
Ought to be very simple for you.

204
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:16,750
Shall I bring the girls in, sir?

205
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:18,911
- Girls?
- Yes.

206
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:22,231
Just a possibility.
It may be something to go on.

207
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:26,512
Sit down.

208
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:30,711
Sorry I had to drag you
away from school.

209
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:33,553
We love to be dragged away
from school. Thank you.

210
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:36,280
Are you a detective, monsieur?

211
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:41,957
Yes. And monsieur here
is the crown prosecutor.

212
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:44,112
Hello.

213
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:47,113
- Would you like a biscuit?
- Please.

214
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:51,559
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

215
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:54,109
Now, my little ones,
tell me everything.

216
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:57,678
Your mother said that you
passed the Villette house last night.

217
00:19:57,840 --> 00:19:59,956
- That's right.
- And what was the time?

218
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:03,032
- Eleven o'clock.
- No, it was after 11:O0.

219
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:06,597
- Well, now, which of you is right?
- Well, we had been babysitting...

220
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:08,990
...but we didn't go straight home.
That's why.

221
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:11,799
Well, shall we say, then,
between 11 and 11:30?

222
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:13,951
- Yes.
- And what did you see?

223
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:16,680
We saw someone
leaving the Villette house.

224
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:19,149
- A man or a woman?
- Man.

225
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:21,436
- Well, what was he like?
- He was a priest.

226
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:23,352
- What?
- A priest.

227
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:26,919
Now this is very important.
Are you sure?

228
00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:29,036
Quite sure.

229
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:36,959
Tell us exactly.

230
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:41,796
On our way home by the Rue Valentine,
we passed Monsieur Villette's house.

231
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:46,715
We know it well. It was very dark,
and she was frightened.

232
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:50,555
- I was not.
- Yes, you were, and we began to hurry.

233
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:53,598
And then suddenly,
there was this priest.

234
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:57,833
He was coming out of the house
and walking away.

235
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,673
- Did you see his face?
- No.

236
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:02,717
How tall was he?

237
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:06,031
Like him.

238
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:09,959
- Was he fat or thin?
- Not fat. Not thin.

239
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:13,237
Did you notice anything special
about him?

240
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:16,030
- Did he see you?
- I don't think so.

241
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:18,830
But you are absolutely sure
he was a priest?

242
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:21,476
Yes.

243
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:26,993
Thank you. You may go now.

244
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:33,314
Oh, my little ones, I do not want you
to say anything to anyone about this.

245
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:34,708
- Promise.
- Yes.

246
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:37,110
Thank you.

247
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:40,636
Murphy, I want you to check
every rectory in town...

248
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:43,712
...and find out which priests
were out late last night.

249
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:45,518
Yes, sir.

250
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:53,112
Of course, it's absurd
that a priest would be involved.

251
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:55,951
You don't really think
it could be a priest?

252
00:21:56,120 --> 00:21:57,633
Yes, maybe.

253
00:21:57,800 --> 00:21:59,552
- Who?
- I have to make sure.

254
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:01,790
I can't tell you until
I've checked further.

255
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:04,428
Well, don't be so mysterious.

256
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:36,509
Most of his time is given
to his parishioners.

257
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:38,750
Was he with one on Tuesday night?

258
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:41,878
I have no idea where he was
or what he did...

259
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:44,793
...but I'm perfectly sure it's all right.

260
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:48,714
He will tell you so himself. Come in.

261
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:54,071
- Good evening, Father Logan.
- Good evening.

262
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:57,630
I believe this room has given this
gentleman from the police department...

263
00:22:57,800 --> 00:23:02,828
...the idea that we hide grime with paint,
but it is not so, Mr. Murphy.

264
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:07,034
We have made certain that the walls
underneath are spotless.

265
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:10,272
I don't question that, Father.
Sorry to bother you, Father.

266
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:12,431
It's no bother. What can I do for you?

267
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:15,478
It seems that Inspector Larrue
wishes to speak to you.

268
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:18,598
Would it be convenient for you
to come down to the office now?

269
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:20,273
Certainly. Certainly.

270
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:23,750
It's all right, Father,
I told Mr. Larrue I'd be available.

271
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:25,148
Good night.

272
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:48,318
What is it, Father?
Who was that man?

273
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:51,870
The police want to ask
Father Logan some questions.

274
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:54,838
Oh, now you're bringing
your bicycle into the study.

275
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:58,754
How much further into the rectory
are you gonna push it?

276
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:09,715
- Alma, have you washed the cassock?
- Not yet.

277
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:12,519
- Where is it?
- It's in our room.

278
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:15,592
Don't wash it. I don't want it washed.

279
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:18,149
- But why?
- Listen to me.

280
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:23,597
I'm sorry to have kept you waiting.
I was occupied on the telephone.

281
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:26,399
It's all right, Murphy. I'll call you later.

282
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:31,279
- Unpleasant bit of business, isn't it?
- It is, yes.

283
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:33,112
Sit down.

284
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:38,315
Well, just a few questions,
and we'll get it over as soon as possible.

285
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:40,471
You've been at St. Marie's
for how long?

286
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:42,870
For nearly two years now.

287
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:47,670
I have known Father Millars for...
For a long while.

288
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:50,638
Matter of fact, I was a choirboy
when he was at the basilica.

289
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:52,836
Really?

290
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:56,231
I've heard that you saw military service
during the last war.

291
00:24:56,400 --> 00:25:00,757
I believe you were awarded
the Military Cross. Yes.

292
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:03,275
You seem to have done
a number of brave things.

293
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:05,317
Well, I survived.

294
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:07,277
Are you given to understatement,
Father?

295
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:09,158
That depends.

296
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:15,273
This case, this Villette murder,
is all understatement so far.

297
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:17,795
- You knew Villette, didn't you?
- Slightly, yes.

298
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:20,030
Then perhaps you can help.
What was he like?

299
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:22,236
Well, unfortunately,
I didn't know him well.

300
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:25,312
Well, did you know him
socially or in a business way?

301
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:29,109
In neither way, actually.
I'd met him once many years ago.

302
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:31,669
- Cigarette?
- Thank you, no.

303
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:36,513
No one seems to have
known this Villette...

304
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:40,070
...and yet he was a lawyer.
He had clients.

305
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:43,391
Not one of his clients have any
information to give about the man.

306
00:25:43,560 --> 00:25:47,758
Oh, not that you were a client of his,
as you say, you hardly knew him...

307
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:51,799
...but may I ask what were you going
to see him about yesterday morning?

308
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:54,349
Well, that was a personal matter.

309
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:57,478
You were acting for someone?
One of your parishioners, perhaps.

310
00:25:57,640 --> 00:26:01,792
I can just say that my visit didn't have
anything to do with Villette's death.

311
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:03,916
Well, of course it didn't, Father.

312
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:07,959
But you do understand that I must
consider every scrap of information?

313
00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:09,792
When a murder has been committed...

314
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:12,713
...each scrap of information
is important to the police.

315
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:17,032
- Of course.
- I know sometimes it seems like prying.

316
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:19,714
- It can be very embarrassing.
- I'm not embarrassed.

317
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:22,440
Good. Very good.

318
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:27,996
I've been wondering about the lady
you met outside Villette's house.

319
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:31,118
Quite by chance, I happened
to see you from inside the house.

320
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:34,716
Inspector, the appointment
that I had with Villette...

321
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:36,711
...couldn't be of any importance to you.

322
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:38,871
But we aren't discussing
that at the moment.

323
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:43,558
You see, with a murder, one has
to jump from one detail to another.

324
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:45,438
Perhaps I jumped
too suddenly for you.

325
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:48,399
Well, it seems maybe I don't
follow as fast as you jump.

326
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:51,552
I have a methodical mind.
I do have to take things one by one.

327
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:54,236
So do I.

328
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:55,913
So do I.

329
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:59,197
The difficulty, perhaps,
is that, well, we aren't thinking...

330
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:02,670
...from the same point of view.
Could it be that, Father?

331
00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:07,311
That could be. I don't really know
what your point of view is.

332
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:12,351
Well, then I've put it badly. Very badly.

333
00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:17,036
Let me try again. Now, this lady
you met outside Villette's house...

334
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:19,714
I wish I could discuss it, but I can't.

335
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:21,791
- Who is she?
- She isn't involved.

336
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:24,952
- That is for me to decide.
- I know, I know...

337
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:27,076
...but you'll have to take my word for it.

338
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:31,552
I respect your word,
but I need your help.

339
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:33,438
I'm not able to help.

340
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:36,478
I see.

341
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:40,110
I see, of course.

342
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:46,911
I just don't want all this mystification
to make things too awkward for you.

343
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:48,348
Awkward for me?

344
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:52,308
A priest was seen leaving Villette's
house at the time of the murder.

345
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:56,189
I saw a priest outside Villette's
house the next morning.

346
00:27:56,360 --> 00:27:58,874
- Well, Father?
- Well?

347
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:01,469
Too much mystification
might lead one to believe...

348
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:04,712
...that both priests were one
and the same, mightn't it?

349
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:07,235
What have you to say?

350
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:11,473
- What would you want me to say?
- That is up to you, Father.

351
00:28:12,520 --> 00:28:15,751
Well, then, I would say
that a man of intelligence...

352
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:18,992
...wouldn't be led to believe
anything on so little evidence.

353
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:22,029
You're perfectly right.

354
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:24,919
We have checked
on every priest in Quebec.

355
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:30,108
Each could account for his movements at
the time of the murder, each except one.

356
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:33,272
Where were you at 11:00, Father?

357
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:35,991
- I was walking.
- Alone?

358
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:38,628
- No.
- Good.

359
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:42,918
Now, if you will just give me
the name and the address of the person.

360
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:45,438
I can't.

361
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:53,270
Father...

362
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:55,431
...don't you wanna help me?

363
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:58,751
- I've done my best.
- But you refuse to answer my questions.

364
00:28:58,920 --> 00:29:03,072
I'm sorry. I know, l...
It isn't possible for me to answer them.

365
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:04,832
Then it's a pity...

366
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,309
...a great pity.

367
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:12,391
Good night, Father.

368
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:18,754
I'm deeply sorry.

369
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:21,070
Good night, inspector.

370
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:40,672
Get me Mr. Robertson.

371
00:29:40,840 --> 00:29:43,115
Yes, the crown prosecutor.

372
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:46,239
What?

373
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:50,678
I don't care where he is, find him.
I said, find him wherever he is.

374
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:54,596
Take it slow. Come on.

375
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:56,512
Come on.

376
00:29:58,680 --> 00:30:00,272
Lower.

377
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:02,113
Oh, you have
to get much lower.

378
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:10,956
Willy, you're wanted on the telephone.

379
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:14,556
- That's no fair. Leave me alone.
- I'm not kidding. You really are.

380
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:16,631
Oh, see what they want, Ruth.

381
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:25,871
All right, Ruth, where are you?
I'll take it.

382
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:28,554
- You idiot.
- Thank you.

383
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:32,633
Hello. Yes, this is Robertson.
Oh, it's you, Larrue.

384
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:34,677
- Fix me a drink?
- Scotch and soda?

385
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:37,479
Just scotch, no water.
Yes, hello.

386
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:41,189
You ought to be in bed with a thriller
instead of worrying people.

387
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:44,910
Yes, yes, I'm listening.

388
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:50,032
- Drink, darling?
- I'll get it.

389
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:53,590
What? But aren't you
jumping to conclusions?

390
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:55,557
Are you sure?

391
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:57,517
Yes, I see.

392
00:30:57,680 --> 00:31:01,468
Yes. Yes, inspector, yes.
I'll be right over.

393
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:04,549
Willy, don't look so unhappy.

394
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:07,393
I can't help it. Murder's not
particularly pleasant.

395
00:31:07,560 --> 00:31:09,676
You should be able to take that in stride.

396
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:11,512
Not this one.

397
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:15,878
- Is it about the Villette murder?
- Yes.

398
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:19,677
And the unpleasant part of it is,
a priest is suspected.

399
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:22,149
- What nonsense.
- Fantastic, isn't it?

400
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:25,551
But a priest was actually seen
leaving Villette's house.

401
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:27,233
Which priest?

402
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:31,188
Well, Larrue thinks it's Logan
from St. Marie's Church.

403
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:34,477
- Do you know him?
- I've heard of him.

404
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:38,713
Well, I must be off. I hate to.
Thanks for a lovely party.

405
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:41,599
- Good night, Willy.
- Good night, Ruth.

406
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:44,035
- You'll find your way out, won't you?
- Yes.

407
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:47,272
- Good night, everybody.
- Good night.

408
00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:52,116
- Ruth...
- We have guests, Pierre.

409
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:27,353
It was a good party, wasn't it?

410
00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:33,951
- Ruth.
- Yes?

411
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:36,031
Stop worrying.

412
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:38,555
- About what?
- Logan. The whole idea is ridiculous.

413
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:41,188
- Why on earth...?
- Oh, shut up, please. Shut up.

414
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:43,836
Pierre, I'm sorry.

415
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:46,311
You're still in love with him.

416
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:47,708
That should be apparent.

417
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:53,318
- You never spoke about it.
- Well, I'm not going to talk about it now.

418
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:56,711
Oh, yes. You are going to speak about it.

419
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:58,279
I'm not going on like this.

420
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:03,392
- You don't have to.
- What do you want me to do?

421
00:33:03,560 --> 00:33:05,437
Whatever you wish.

422
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:09,479
Very simple, isn't it? What does one do
when one's wife is in love with a priest?

423
00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:14,117
- You can leave me.
- How easily you can say that.

424
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:17,398
I'm not in love with you.
I've never been in love with you.

425
00:33:20,280 --> 00:33:22,748
But I never wanted to believe it.

426
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:25,957
That's not my fault.
I've never pretended anything with you.

427
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:31,074
I hope he's in trouble, terrible trouble.

428
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:39,271
Michael.

429
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:42,075
My poor Michael.

430
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:03,234
Hello? I'd like to speak
to Father Logan, please.

431
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:04,992
Father Logan?

432
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:07,720
Oh, but he's asleep.

433
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:10,030
- I'm not asleep.
- It is very late.

434
00:34:10,200 --> 00:34:11,918
I'll take it.

435
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:16,072
Thank you.

436
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:18,592
Hello, this is Father Logan.

437
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:20,592
I've got to see you.

438
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:23,069
No, I've got to see you.

439
00:34:23,240 --> 00:34:25,959
I can't tell you now. Tomorrow?

440
00:34:26,120 --> 00:34:28,680
No, not at the rectory, please.

441
00:34:29,160 --> 00:34:33,631
Michael, listen. I've got to meet you
somewhere. Anywhere.

442
00:34:34,200 --> 00:34:35,838
Are you listening?

443
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,355
I'm going to Lévis tomorrow morning...

444
00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:40,033
...on the 9:00 ferry.

445
00:34:40,200 --> 00:34:41,792
All right.

446
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:45,152
Good night.

447
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:50,316
- Good morning.
- Good morning, Father Logan.

448
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:54,716
We shouldn't be seen together,
for your sake.

449
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:58,919
- I had to see you.
- The police have been questioning me.

450
00:35:59,080 --> 00:36:02,277
They saw us talking outside of
Villette's house the other morning.

451
00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:05,955
- They're trying to find out who you are.
- I don't care. I've got to tell you.

452
00:36:06,120 --> 00:36:09,590
- You are being suspected.
- I know that.

453
00:36:10,680 --> 00:36:12,318
You shouldn't be seen talking to me.

454
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:14,755
There are probably police
all over the boat.

455
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:27,677
The only thing is for me to tell them
you were with me that night.

456
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:30,877
- You can't. They'd wanna know why.
- Do you think I care?

457
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:33,395
I'll tell them everything if I have to.

458
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:36,518
Ruth, you've got to think of yourself,
think of your husband.

459
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:39,277
Think of Pierre?

460
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:42,113
Think of him before I think of you?

461
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:45,552
- I've never been able to do that.
- You must.

462
00:36:46,040 --> 00:36:48,190
It's too late to think of him.

463
00:36:48,360 --> 00:36:50,112
We spoke of you last night.

464
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:53,550
He's still in love with me.

465
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:56,390
I'm not that good.

466
00:36:57,720 --> 00:37:01,759
I love you, Michael.
I've always been in love with you.

467
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:03,999
I know.

468
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:06,435
I know it's wrong. I can't help it.

469
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:09,556
Do you want me to lie to you?

470
00:37:09,720 --> 00:37:11,950
No, I don't want you to lie to me.

471
00:37:12,120 --> 00:37:15,510
- But I don't want you to lie to yourself.
- But I haven't changed, Michael.

472
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:19,070
I've been married seven years,
and I haven't changed.

473
00:37:20,360 --> 00:37:22,430
Are you afraid of me?

474
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:24,392
Why?

475
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:26,318
Why?

476
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:30,273
You're in love with me.
You've always been in love with me.

477
00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:32,351
- You haven't changed.
- Ruth, I've changed.

478
00:37:32,520 --> 00:37:33,748
You've changed too.

479
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:36,518
You want me to pretend that.

480
00:37:36,680 --> 00:37:39,240
No, I don't want you to pretend.

481
00:37:40,360 --> 00:37:43,033
Ruth, do you understand?

482
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:46,749
I chose to be what I am.
I believe in what I am.

483
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:48,194
Michael.

484
00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:51,557
I want you to see things
as they are and not...

485
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:55,158
And not go on hurting yourself.

486
00:38:00,080 --> 00:38:02,071
Don't pity me.

487
00:38:04,680 --> 00:38:08,036
L... I shan't bother you again.

488
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:25,518
And you followed her from the ferry
to 22 Grande Allée?

489
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:29,309
- Yes, sir.
- This is absurd, Larrue.

490
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:32,597
That is all, Sergeant Farouche.
Murphy, thank you.

491
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:37,479
This will be very embarrassing for me.

492
00:38:37,640 --> 00:38:39,756
Why should it be, sir?

493
00:38:42,360 --> 00:38:44,555
I'll have to apologize
to Madame Grandfort...

494
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:46,950
...for this ridiculous report
your men turned in.

495
00:38:47,120 --> 00:38:50,510
I will apologize, sir,
if an apology is necessary.

496
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:54,272
Very well.

497
00:38:54,440 --> 00:38:56,635
I'll call Madame Grandfort tomorrow.

498
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:58,472
Why not get it over with, sir?

499
00:38:58,640 --> 00:39:02,030
And then we can get on
with the apologies, if necessary.

500
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,912
Hello, Pierre. This is Willy.

501
00:39:15,080 --> 00:39:17,150
Oh, no. No.

502
00:39:17,320 --> 00:39:20,357
Is Ruth there? Yes, please.

503
00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:23,518
Hello, Ruth.

504
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:25,952
I see.

505
00:39:27,160 --> 00:39:30,311
Yes, I understand. Yes. Of course.

506
00:39:31,320 --> 00:39:34,118
That's very kind of you. Thank you.

507
00:39:35,240 --> 00:39:37,117
What does Willy want?

508
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:41,151
He wants me to come to his office now.

509
00:39:41,320 --> 00:39:43,390
May I ask you why?

510
00:39:43,560 --> 00:39:46,313
I was seen on the ferry this morning
with Michael Logan.

511
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:48,436
Apparently, I was followed
by a detective.

512
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:51,876
Could you have picked
a less public place if you had to see...?

513
00:39:52,040 --> 00:39:53,837
I'm sorry.

514
00:39:54,360 --> 00:39:56,635
Would you like to tell me
what you're going to do?

515
00:39:56,800 --> 00:40:00,713
I'm going to answer whatever questions
the inspector wishes to ask me.

516
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:04,919
I'm also going to explain that Michael
could not have killed Villette.

517
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:08,631
Has Father Logan cleared himself
to your satisfaction?

518
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:11,155
He didn't have to.

519
00:40:11,320 --> 00:40:13,311
I was with him at the time.

520
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:20,275
Would you like me to go with you?

521
00:40:20,680 --> 00:40:24,992
I'm in no position to ask
any favors of you, Pierre.

522
00:40:31,840 --> 00:40:34,957
- Monsieur and Madame Grandfort.
- Do come in.

523
00:40:35,120 --> 00:40:37,509
I'm extremely grateful that
you are both cooperative.

524
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:41,116
- Ruth, Pierre, I'm terribly sorry.
- It's perfectly all right.

525
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:43,191
Larrue promises to keep it
from the press.

526
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:44,679
I will do my best.

527
00:40:44,840 --> 00:40:46,671
Sit down, please.

528
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:53,469
- Father Logan's outside.
- Bring him in. Come in.

529
00:40:54,200 --> 00:40:56,270
I've asked Father Logan to join us.

530
00:40:56,440 --> 00:40:57,953
Father Logan...

531
00:40:58,120 --> 00:41:00,350
...Madame and Monsieur Grandfort,
Mr. Robertson.

532
00:41:00,520 --> 00:41:03,034
- Me, you know.
- Good evening, Father Logan.

533
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:04,918
- Good evening.
- Sit down.

534
00:41:05,080 --> 00:41:06,593
Thank you.

535
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:16,997
- May we begin, please?
- Well, Madame Grandfort...

536
00:41:17,160 --> 00:41:18,912
What do you wish to know?

537
00:41:19,080 --> 00:41:22,277
You met and talked with Father Logan
on the 9:00 ferry.

538
00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:25,591
- Yes.
- May I ask the reason for this meeting?

539
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:28,832
I don't think the reason
could help you, inspector.

540
00:41:29,640 --> 00:41:32,108
- It was personal?
- Yes.

541
00:41:32,280 --> 00:41:33,508
Very well.

542
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:35,831
You also met and spoke
with Father Logan...

543
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:37,797
...the morning after Villette's murder.

544
00:41:37,960 --> 00:41:40,997
You met and spoke to him
immediately in front of Villette's house.

545
00:41:41,160 --> 00:41:43,196
- Yes.
- May I ask the reason for that?

546
00:41:43,360 --> 00:41:45,396
I had an appointment
with Monsieur Villette.

547
00:41:45,560 --> 00:41:48,518
- He was your lawyer?
- No.

548
00:41:49,320 --> 00:41:52,676
Father Logan, knowing of the murder,
stopped you from entering the house?

549
00:41:52,840 --> 00:41:54,432
- Yes.
- Of course, he did not know...

550
00:41:54,600 --> 00:41:56,830
...you had an appointment
with Monsieur Villette.

551
00:41:57,000 --> 00:42:01,312
He did. The night before, I'd had
an appointment with Father Logan.

552
00:42:01,720 --> 00:42:05,349
I told him I was going to meet Monsieur
Villette at 9:30 the following morning.

553
00:42:06,280 --> 00:42:08,191
You had an appointment
with Father Logan...

554
00:42:08,360 --> 00:42:10,351
...the night Monsieur Villette
was murdered?

555
00:42:10,520 --> 00:42:12,033
- Yes.
- Where?

556
00:42:12,200 --> 00:42:14,873
- We took a ride in my car.
- What time?

557
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:17,076
Between 9 and 11.

558
00:42:20,040 --> 00:42:21,871
Madame Grandfort.

559
00:42:22,320 --> 00:42:24,675
- Are you sure of the time?
- Oh, yes.

560
00:42:24,840 --> 00:42:29,072
I got home just after 11. My husband
had come in five minutes before.

561
00:42:29,240 --> 00:42:31,231
That's right, inspector.

562
00:42:32,040 --> 00:42:36,636
You told your husband, of course,
that you had just seen Father Logan?

563
00:42:38,520 --> 00:42:41,432
No, I did not tell my husband.

564
00:42:43,640 --> 00:42:46,677
Was there any particular reason
why you shouldn't have told him?

565
00:42:48,040 --> 00:42:50,759
- Yes.
- Inspector, I beg you.

566
00:42:50,920 --> 00:42:53,639
Consider if your line of questioning
has to be so personal.

567
00:42:53,800 --> 00:42:55,552
That is for me to decide, Father.

568
00:42:57,800 --> 00:43:00,189
- Madame Grandfort?
- Yes?

569
00:43:00,360 --> 00:43:02,396
You understand I must
ask these questions.

570
00:43:02,560 --> 00:43:04,357
Yes. I came to tell that you...

571
00:43:04,520 --> 00:43:07,512
...Father Logan could not have been
involved in Villette's death.

572
00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:09,193
I was with him at the time.

573
00:43:09,360 --> 00:43:11,828
I have accepted everything
that you have said, madame.

574
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:13,433
But I must know, if possible...

575
00:43:13,600 --> 00:43:16,751
...the reason for your appointment
with Monsieur Villette.

576
00:43:18,560 --> 00:43:20,596
Monsieur Villette was blackmailing me.

577
00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:23,829
I had met Father Logan to ask his advice.

578
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:30,756
You hadn't told
your husband about this?

579
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:35,792
- It was...
- It was what, madame?

580
00:43:35,960 --> 00:43:37,712
It was nothing to do with my husband.

581
00:43:37,880 --> 00:43:41,475
- Surely he would have been concerned.
- Yes. You see, that was it.

582
00:43:41,640 --> 00:43:44,359
- I didn't want to worry him.
- So you turned to Father Logan.

583
00:43:44,520 --> 00:43:47,830
- Yes.
- Is Father Logan your parish priest?

584
00:43:48,120 --> 00:43:50,315
- No.
- No?

585
00:43:50,480 --> 00:43:54,075
Yet you turned to him for advice when
you wouldn't turn to your husband.

586
00:43:54,440 --> 00:43:57,796
- Father Logan is an old friend.
- And he advised you to tell your husband.

587
00:43:57,960 --> 00:44:00,269
No, how could he? He couldn't do that.

588
00:44:03,120 --> 00:44:05,395
Before your first appointment
with Father Logan...

589
00:44:05,560 --> 00:44:07,312
...he knew you were being blackmailed?

590
00:44:07,480 --> 00:44:10,074
Oh, how could he?
I hadn't seen him in years.

591
00:44:10,240 --> 00:44:13,630
You hadn't seen him in years, and yet
you say he was an old friend.

592
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:17,319
Mr. Larrue.

593
00:44:17,480 --> 00:44:18,993
- Inspector?
- Yes, sir?

594
00:44:19,160 --> 00:44:21,390
My wife doesn't have to
answer those questions.

595
00:44:21,560 --> 00:44:23,551
She's not under oath.

596
00:44:23,720 --> 00:44:26,598
Your wife was seen outside
Villette's house with Father Logan.

597
00:44:27,640 --> 00:44:29,631
She was seen this morning
with Father Logan.

598
00:44:29,800 --> 00:44:32,394
She told us of an appointment
with him that took place...

599
00:44:32,560 --> 00:44:34,551
...the night Monsieur Villette
was murdered.

600
00:44:36,360 --> 00:44:38,078
Surely, Monsieur Grandfort...

601
00:44:38,240 --> 00:44:40,959
...you do not want your wife
to implicate herself further.

602
00:44:41,120 --> 00:44:43,031
It is you who are trying to implicate her.

603
00:44:43,200 --> 00:44:46,909
My wife came here to answer questions
and to clear, as far as possible...

604
00:44:47,080 --> 00:44:50,993
...Father Logan of any suspicions.
She has done both of those things.

605
00:44:51,160 --> 00:44:54,277
Madame Grandfort,
why were you being blackmailed?

606
00:44:54,800 --> 00:44:56,791
You don't need to answer that.

607
00:44:57,480 --> 00:44:59,072
Why shouldn't she, Father?

608
00:44:59,560 --> 00:45:02,996
- What are you afraid of?
- It isn't necessary. Don't answer.

609
00:45:03,160 --> 00:45:06,550
Madame Grandfort,
are you trying to protect Father Logan?

610
00:45:06,720 --> 00:45:09,518
From what? He hasn't done anything.

611
00:45:10,320 --> 00:45:12,550
It would seem as if he had.

612
00:45:16,720 --> 00:45:19,553
Are you a human being, inspector?

613
00:45:20,440 --> 00:45:24,149
You think it's important
for me to tell you...

614
00:45:24,320 --> 00:45:26,754
...why I was being blackmailed.

615
00:45:27,520 --> 00:45:31,195
You don't care whom I hurt, just so long
as I answer all your questions.

616
00:45:31,360 --> 00:45:34,909
- I only want to clear a murder.
- Yes, I know.

617
00:45:35,560 --> 00:45:37,391
You only want everything clear.

618
00:45:38,280 --> 00:45:40,430
And I want to clear Father Logan.

619
00:45:40,600 --> 00:45:42,750
- Ruth.
- Willy.

620
00:45:42,920 --> 00:45:44,558
May I have a glass of water, please?

621
00:45:46,760 --> 00:45:48,239
Ruth.

622
00:45:48,760 --> 00:45:51,718
Pierre, why must you hear
what I'm going to say?

623
00:45:59,080 --> 00:46:01,913
Thank you, Willy.
Inspector...

624
00:46:03,320 --> 00:46:06,596
...the blackmail was about
me and Father Logan.

625
00:46:07,920 --> 00:46:10,718
Father Logan and I grew up together.

626
00:46:11,720 --> 00:46:14,314
Have you ever been young, inspector?

627
00:46:14,960 --> 00:46:18,635
<i>Of course, you know</i>
<i>that the first thing is to fall in love.</i>

628
00:46:46,320 --> 00:46:49,710
If we'd been engaged,
it wouldn't have mattered...

629
00:46:49,880 --> 00:46:53,555
...because the war came.
He was one of the first to volunteer.

630
00:46:53,720 --> 00:46:55,551
<i>I hated him for that.</i>

631
00:46:55,720 --> 00:46:58,029
<i>I was selfish even then.</i>

632
00:46:58,560 --> 00:47:00,471
<i>He took things so seriously.</i>

633
00:47:01,080 --> 00:47:03,640
<i>War. And love.</i>

634
00:47:04,200 --> 00:47:06,077
<i>Yes, even love.</i>

635
00:47:07,040 --> 00:47:09,838
<i>Because when I said</i>
<i>we ought to get married...</i>

636
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:12,833
<i>... he said there were enough</i>
<i>widows already.</i>

637
00:47:13,120 --> 00:47:16,635
<i>He said he loved me too much.</i>

638
00:47:17,880 --> 00:47:21,031
<i>He didn 't know</i>
<i>he could never love me enough.</i>

639
00:47:22,360 --> 00:47:24,749
<i>That night, we went dancing.</i>

640
00:47:25,280 --> 00:47:26,793
<i>It was our last evening together.</i>

641
00:47:50,360 --> 00:47:52,669
<i>It was all too short.</i>

642
00:47:53,400 --> 00:47:56,198
<i>That was the night Michael went away.</i>

643
00:47:57,120 --> 00:48:00,078
<i>I thought the world was coming</i>
<i>to an end.</i>

644
00:48:00,880 --> 00:48:05,396
<i>I suppose there were millions of people</i>
<i>feeling the same way that night.</i>

645
00:48:08,320 --> 00:48:11,073
<i>You don 't think of millions of people.</i>

646
00:48:16,520 --> 00:48:18,590
<i>You think of yourself...</i>

647
00:48:19,240 --> 00:48:21,470
<i>... and the one you're in love with.</i>

648
00:48:36,120 --> 00:48:38,680
He asked me not to wait for him.

649
00:48:39,080 --> 00:48:42,197
A lot of other boys must've said
the same thing to their girls.

650
00:48:42,360 --> 00:48:44,191
<i>I had to wait for him.</i>

651
00:48:44,360 --> 00:48:47,079
<i>His letters were long at first,</i>
<i>but always serious.</i>

652
00:48:47,240 --> 00:48:49,151
<i>I didn 't want serious letters...</i>

653
00:48:49,320 --> 00:48:52,835
<i>... but I would prefer those</i>
<i>to no letters at all.</i>

654
00:48:53,240 --> 00:48:55,071
<i>Because...</i>

655
00:48:55,240 --> 00:48:57,310
<i>... after a while...</i>

656
00:48:57,520 --> 00:48:59,511
<i>... he stopped writing.</i>

657
00:49:00,680 --> 00:49:02,352
<i>Soon afterward...</i>

658
00:49:02,520 --> 00:49:05,159
<i>... I started working</i>
<i>for my future husband.</i>

659
00:49:05,320 --> 00:49:07,276
<i>Pierre was...</i>

660
00:49:08,120 --> 00:49:10,076
Pierre was...

661
00:49:11,200 --> 00:49:14,237
Madame Grandfort,
perhaps if you are unable to continue...

662
00:49:14,400 --> 00:49:15,879
It's all right. L...

663
00:49:16,040 --> 00:49:17,519
I'm sorry.

664
00:49:18,360 --> 00:49:21,079
Pierre was always so brilliant.

665
00:49:21,320 --> 00:49:22,958
He was kind.

666
00:49:23,120 --> 00:49:24,951
<i>He realized I was unhappy.</i>

667
00:49:25,120 --> 00:49:27,759
<i>And like very kind people...</i>

668
00:49:27,920 --> 00:49:31,549
<i>... he didn 't ask me why.</i>
<i>He just tried to amuse me.</i>

669
00:49:32,280 --> 00:49:34,191
<i>We got married.</i>

670
00:49:34,480 --> 00:49:35,879
<i>I was happy.</i>

671
00:49:36,040 --> 00:49:37,871
<i>I was through with...</i>

672
00:49:38,040 --> 00:49:41,396
<i>I thought I was through with...</i>

673
00:49:41,640 --> 00:49:43,312
<i>... you know...</i>

674
00:49:43,720 --> 00:49:46,280
<i>Well. Oh, yes...</i>

675
00:49:46,440 --> 00:49:50,433
<i>... it was at my wedding</i>
<i>that I saw Villette for the first time.</i>

676
00:50:00,440 --> 00:50:02,510
Then the war was over.

677
00:50:02,680 --> 00:50:04,910
The men were coming home.

678
00:50:05,840 --> 00:50:10,197
I knew the day
when he would come home.

679
00:50:10,680 --> 00:50:13,592
On that day, I went down to the port.

680
00:50:14,120 --> 00:50:16,315
<i>A boat had just come in.</i>

681
00:50:18,760 --> 00:50:20,352
<i>Suddenly, I saw him.</i>

682
00:50:21,040 --> 00:50:23,474
<i>He had changed, I suppose...</i>

683
00:50:23,640 --> 00:50:25,631
<i>... but I didn 't notice.</i>

684
00:50:30,160 --> 00:50:32,594
<i>We arranged to meet the next day.</i>

685
00:50:32,840 --> 00:50:34,637
<i>It was a lovely day.</i>

686
00:50:34,800 --> 00:50:36,836
<i>The end of summer.</i>

687
00:50:37,280 --> 00:50:40,033
<i>Michael talked and talked.</i>

688
00:50:40,840 --> 00:50:44,355
<i>He told me all the thoughts</i>
<i>that had come to him during the war.</i>

689
00:50:44,520 --> 00:50:47,671
<i>I didn 't want to hear about the war.</i>

690
00:50:48,760 --> 00:50:51,320
<i>But the war had changed him.</i>

691
00:50:54,760 --> 00:50:58,435
<i>Then a storm came up, so suddenly.</i>

692
00:51:00,680 --> 00:51:03,717
<i>We saw a house across the field</i>
<i>and ran for shelter.</i>

693
00:51:18,920 --> 00:51:21,070
<i>The house was closed.</i>

694
00:51:51,440 --> 00:51:54,034
<i>I don 't know what time it was.</i>

695
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:03,592
<i>But it was late.</i>

696
00:52:03,760 --> 00:52:06,832
<i>We had missed the last ferry</i>
<i>back from the island.</i>

697
00:52:10,200 --> 00:52:13,749
<i>There was no way I could</i>
<i>get in touch with my husband.</i>

698
00:52:16,960 --> 00:52:19,713
It stopped raining in the morning.

699
00:52:43,720 --> 00:52:46,757
<i>A man came walking down</i>
<i>through the garden.</i>

700
00:52:46,920 --> 00:52:48,433
<i>He walked as though he owned it.</i>

701
00:52:50,080 --> 00:52:52,548
<i>As a matter of fact, he did.</i>

702
00:52:52,720 --> 00:52:54,915
<i>I was still in the summerhouse...</i>

703
00:52:55,080 --> 00:52:57,594
<i>... and he didn 't know who I was...</i>

704
00:52:57,760 --> 00:53:00,672
<i>... but apparently,</i>
<i>he knew I was a woman...</i>

705
00:53:01,160 --> 00:53:04,118
<i>... because he made some remark</i>
<i>to Michael.</i>

706
00:53:04,280 --> 00:53:05,998
<i>Michael knocked him down.</i>

707
00:53:06,160 --> 00:53:09,470
<i>I came out and stood on the steps of</i>
<i>the summerhouse, looked down at him.</i>

708
00:53:09,640 --> 00:53:11,517
<i>He looked up at me and said:</i>

709
00:53:11,680 --> 00:53:15,070
<i>"Good morning, Madame Grandfort."</i>

710
00:53:15,960 --> 00:53:18,030
<i>It was Villette.</i>

711
00:53:18,520 --> 00:53:20,875
<i>What could I say to Michael?</i>

712
00:53:21,240 --> 00:53:22,753
<i>I hadn 't told him I was married.</i>

713
00:53:26,200 --> 00:53:28,919
I didn't see him again for five years.

714
00:53:29,080 --> 00:53:33,631
Nor did I see Villette again,
until the day Michael was ordained.

715
00:54:02,600 --> 00:54:04,511
<i>Then I began running into Villette...</i>

716
00:54:05,720 --> 00:54:07,676
<i>... all the time.</i>

717
00:54:07,960 --> 00:54:09,791
<i>He appeared everywhere I went.</i>

718
00:54:17,240 --> 00:54:20,198
<i>One day in Parliament,</i>
<i>I was listening to Pierre.</i>

719
00:54:20,360 --> 00:54:23,796
<i>Villette came up to me.</i>
<i>He said that he was in trouble.</i>

720
00:54:23,960 --> 00:54:26,110
<i>Something to do with a tax scandal.</i>

721
00:54:26,280 --> 00:54:28,669
<i>Only my husband could help him.</i>

722
00:54:28,920 --> 00:54:32,310
<i>I told him Pierre would never</i>
<i>get involved in anything shady.</i>

723
00:54:32,920 --> 00:54:35,434
<i>Then he threatened</i>
<i>to tell about Michael and me.</i>

724
00:54:35,600 --> 00:54:39,309
<i>What words could I say that would</i>
<i>tell him it was wrong about us?</i>

725
00:54:39,480 --> 00:54:41,596
<i>Pierre's career would be finished.</i>

726
00:54:41,760 --> 00:54:43,830
<i>Michael might be unfrocked.</i>

727
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:47,879
<i>I tried to ignore him,</i>
<i>but he kept after me...</i>

728
00:54:48,040 --> 00:54:50,156
<i>... kept calling up.</i>

729
00:54:54,720 --> 00:54:57,280
<i>Then one day, I ran into him again.</i>

730
00:54:59,040 --> 00:55:01,793
<i>And he gave me 24 hours...</i>

731
00:55:01,960 --> 00:55:03,552
<i>... or else.</i>

732
00:55:03,800 --> 00:55:06,519
<i>Oh, I was really desperate by then.</i>

733
00:55:06,680 --> 00:55:10,514
<i>Then I thought</i>
<i>that maybe Michael might help...</i>

734
00:55:10,760 --> 00:55:14,548
<i>... and I rang him up.</i>
<i>We met that same night.</i>

735
00:55:15,120 --> 00:55:17,350
<i>He was very angry.</i>

736
00:55:17,520 --> 00:55:20,034
<i>He said not to worry about Villette...</i>

737
00:55:20,200 --> 00:55:21,997
<i>... that he would deal with him.</i>

738
00:55:22,160 --> 00:55:25,630
<i>And we arranged to meet the next day</i>
<i>in front of Villette's house.</i>

739
00:55:28,680 --> 00:55:30,989
<i>I went there at 9:30.</i>

740
00:55:31,160 --> 00:55:32,434
<i>I wondered at the crowds.</i>

741
00:55:51,240 --> 00:55:53,595
<i>Then Michael told me Villette was dead.</i>

742
00:55:53,760 --> 00:55:55,910
<i>I couldn 't believe it.</i>

743
00:55:56,080 --> 00:55:58,275
<i>I was free.</i>

744
00:56:02,320 --> 00:56:04,038
Well, inspector?

745
00:56:04,200 --> 00:56:06,430
May my wife leave now?

746
00:56:07,800 --> 00:56:09,518
Certainly.

747
00:56:16,360 --> 00:56:19,670
Father Logan has his alibi now,
doesn't he, Willy?

748
00:56:20,920 --> 00:56:22,478
Of course.

749
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:26,228
Thank you.

750
00:56:32,480 --> 00:56:34,835
Would you like to go now, Father?

751
00:56:35,760 --> 00:56:38,354
- Good night.
- Good night.

752
00:56:38,520 --> 00:56:40,238
Good night, Father.

753
00:56:43,560 --> 00:56:46,279
Well, it's over.

754
00:56:46,440 --> 00:56:48,158
Is it, sir?

755
00:56:48,520 --> 00:56:50,909
- Yes. Let's get out of here.
- Look, sir.

756
00:56:51,080 --> 00:56:53,753
- What's that?
- The autopsy report.

757
00:56:53,920 --> 00:56:57,435
Villette had dinner in a restaurant at 9.
Examining his stomach...

758
00:56:57,600 --> 00:57:01,195
...the doctors found that he couldn't
have died before 11:30.

759
00:57:01,360 --> 00:57:02,588
Larrue.

760
00:57:02,760 --> 00:57:05,354
Madame Grandfort said that
she left Father Logan at 11.

761
00:57:05,520 --> 00:57:07,795
You can do a lot of things in 30 minutes.

762
00:57:13,960 --> 00:57:16,633
- Who is it?
- Pierre.

763
00:57:17,640 --> 00:57:19,471
Come in.

764
00:57:21,640 --> 00:57:24,518
- Sorry I woke you.
- I was awake.

765
00:57:24,680 --> 00:57:27,638
Willy Robertson just called.
He's coming over.

766
00:57:27,800 --> 00:57:31,429
What an odd time to pay us a visit.
Must be very early.

767
00:57:31,600 --> 00:57:33,955
I'm afraid he's coming here officially.

768
00:57:34,640 --> 00:57:35,868
Officially?

769
00:57:36,040 --> 00:57:39,555
The statement you made last night,
it wasn't helpful...

770
00:57:39,880 --> 00:57:43,395
...at least not... Not in the way
you hoped it to be.

771
00:57:43,560 --> 00:57:44,879
But I told the truth.

772
00:57:45,520 --> 00:57:47,590
No one doubts what you said.

773
00:57:47,760 --> 00:57:48,988
I don't see...

774
00:57:49,160 --> 00:57:51,355
You said you left Father Logan at 11:00.

775
00:57:51,520 --> 00:57:55,479
Now they have established
that Villette was murdered at 11:30.

776
00:57:55,640 --> 00:57:57,312
There's a time lag of half an hour.

777
00:58:05,800 --> 00:58:08,360
Did they know about this time lag?

778
00:58:09,520 --> 00:58:11,715
Did they know
before they questioned me?

779
00:58:15,160 --> 00:58:18,755
Why did the inspector
allow me to say all those things?

780
00:58:20,440 --> 00:58:23,477
There was no need for my statement.

781
00:58:25,640 --> 00:58:28,313
- Why is Willy coming here?
- I asked him.

782
00:58:28,480 --> 00:58:31,711
I want him to talk to you.
You may be called as a witness.

783
00:58:32,120 --> 00:58:33,792
A witness?

784
00:58:33,960 --> 00:58:37,032
- Are they going to arrest Michael?
- Yes.

785
00:58:37,240 --> 00:58:40,357
But he hasn't done anything.
He had no reason to.

786
00:58:40,520 --> 00:58:44,399
- Why should they think he killed Villette?
- Your statement answered that.

787
00:58:44,760 --> 00:58:45,988
My statement?

788
00:58:46,160 --> 00:58:49,596
He says you have given the motive
they've been waiting for.

789
00:58:49,760 --> 00:58:51,113
I...

790
00:58:53,800 --> 00:58:56,189
I should have lied, Pierre.

791
00:58:56,360 --> 00:58:58,112
I lied before.

792
00:58:58,280 --> 00:59:00,589
I should have lied last night.

793
00:59:01,640 --> 00:59:04,108
They'll twist what I've said.

794
00:59:04,280 --> 00:59:06,999
They'll turn it, they'll use it.

795
00:59:08,360 --> 00:59:10,920
I've given them what they wanted.

796
00:59:16,360 --> 00:59:18,794
I was going to help Michael...

797
00:59:21,160 --> 00:59:23,469
...but I've destroyed him.

798
00:59:27,720 --> 00:59:29,153
And you, Pierre...

799
00:59:31,040 --> 00:59:33,156
What have I done to you?

800
00:59:33,320 --> 00:59:35,629
Willy will soon be here.

801
00:59:35,880 --> 00:59:37,791
You must have your breakfast.

802
00:59:37,960 --> 00:59:40,428
Would you like it here, in your room?

803
00:59:40,600 --> 00:59:42,033
I will send it up.

804
00:59:50,600 --> 00:59:53,910
You must do something.
They're going to arrest you.

805
00:59:54,080 --> 00:59:56,753
Michael, what can we do?

806
00:59:57,000 --> 00:59:58,353
I don't know.

807
00:59:58,520 --> 01:00:01,159
You're not going to let them
bring you to trial?

808
01:00:01,320 --> 01:00:05,632
You understand what that would mean.
You can't let that happen.

809
01:00:15,360 --> 01:00:16,918
Michael...

810
01:00:17,080 --> 01:00:21,153
I've done this to you.
There must be something I can do.

811
01:00:22,440 --> 01:00:24,670
There's nothing we can do.

812
01:00:52,600 --> 01:00:56,832
- I beg your pardon. I'm so sorry.
- It was my fault, madame.

813
01:01:38,120 --> 01:01:40,031
I've been waiting to speak to you,
Father.

814
01:01:40,200 --> 01:01:42,270
You have been talking to the police, yes?

815
01:01:42,440 --> 01:01:44,556
What did the police ask you, Father?

816
01:01:44,720 --> 01:01:48,030
They asked about me.
You told them about me.

817
01:01:48,480 --> 01:01:50,630
I'm going to be arrested, Keller.

818
01:01:50,800 --> 01:01:52,756
You?

819
01:01:52,920 --> 01:01:55,832
Why would they arrest you, Father?

820
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:59,913
You're trying to frighten me. You think
by telling me that, I will give myself up.

821
01:02:00,080 --> 01:02:02,355
You think I am easily frightened
after what I did?

822
01:02:02,520 --> 01:02:04,795
So, what are you going to do
when they arrest you?

823
01:02:04,960 --> 01:02:08,350
Perhaps you'll point your finger at me.
Perhaps you'll say, "It's Keller."

824
01:02:08,520 --> 01:02:12,354
That's what you will do, is it? You are
a coward after all. You are frightened.

825
01:02:12,520 --> 01:02:15,717
Maybe they will hang you instead of me,
and that frightens you.

826
01:02:15,880 --> 01:02:19,429
Perhaps you will tell them. You can't
tell them as long as you are a priest.

827
01:02:19,600 --> 01:02:21,352
Can you?

828
01:02:51,480 --> 01:02:54,756
The priest is frightened, Alma.
You saw the look on his face?

829
01:02:54,920 --> 01:02:57,480
He thinks he can tell the police, yes?
I am ready.

830
01:03:14,560 --> 01:03:17,120
I'd like to speak
with Father Logan, please.

831
01:03:18,040 --> 01:03:20,679
- Father Logan is not here.
- Good morning.

832
01:03:20,840 --> 01:03:24,037
I came to see Father Logan,
but Keller says he's not here.

833
01:03:24,200 --> 01:03:27,397
Not here?
He didn't say he was going out.

834
01:03:27,840 --> 01:03:30,832
- He didn't say anything to me.
- I saw him.

835
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:34,356
I tried to speak to him.
He seemed frightened.

836
01:03:34,920 --> 01:03:39,596
I asked him if I could do anything.
He didn't even hear me.

837
01:03:39,760 --> 01:03:45,312
He went out by that door
20 minutes ago, maybe 30.

838
01:03:45,480 --> 01:03:47,550
Thank you. I'll be back, Father.

839
01:03:48,440 --> 01:03:50,670
All right, Murphy, what is it?

840
01:03:52,920 --> 01:03:54,148
What?

841
01:03:56,240 --> 01:03:58,435
Stand by outside the rectory.

842
01:04:00,240 --> 01:04:01,992
Logan is gone.

843
01:04:08,960 --> 01:04:10,234
Give me the radio room.

844
01:06:20,200 --> 01:06:23,431
Will Father Logan be in for lunch?

845
01:06:25,120 --> 01:06:26,997
I don't know.

846
01:06:42,600 --> 01:06:44,238
Any news yet?

847
01:06:45,800 --> 01:06:47,233
All right.

848
01:06:53,960 --> 01:06:55,552
Hello, Father.

849
01:06:59,680 --> 01:07:02,672
- Have you had your lunch yet?
- No.

850
01:07:02,840 --> 01:07:05,035
Let me order something for you.

851
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:11,434
Mr. Murphy,
where did you find this cassock?

852
01:07:11,600 --> 01:07:13,113
In a patent-leather trunk.

853
01:07:13,280 --> 01:07:16,113
Would you be able to say if
the trunk belonged to the accused?

854
01:07:16,280 --> 01:07:17,474
I would say that it did.

855
01:07:17,640 --> 01:07:21,235
His initials, "M.W.L.," were on the trunk.
The trunk was in his room.

856
01:07:21,400 --> 01:07:24,551
Would you say that the cassock
had been hidden in the trunk?

857
01:07:24,720 --> 01:07:27,996
Did it seem as though placed
so as to escape detection?

858
01:07:28,160 --> 01:07:30,754
Well, there were a lot
of other things covering it.

859
01:07:30,920 --> 01:07:33,718
A raincoat, a pair of galoshes
and several books.

860
01:07:33,880 --> 01:07:36,792
- Thank you. Your witness.
- No questions.

861
01:07:36,960 --> 01:07:38,678
That's all. Thank you.

862
01:07:41,120 --> 01:07:43,076
Call Dr. Bonnard.

863
01:08:04,440 --> 01:08:07,193
The evidence you give
shall be the truth, the whole truth...

864
01:08:07,360 --> 01:08:09,669
...and nothing but the truth.
- I swear.

865
01:08:09,840 --> 01:08:13,037
- Your name?
- Georges Bonnard.

866
01:08:13,200 --> 01:08:15,714
- Your age, please?
- Forty-two.

867
01:08:15,880 --> 01:08:18,633
- Your occupation?
- Pathologist.

868
01:08:18,800 --> 01:08:22,429
- You're a professor at Laval University?
- I am.

869
01:08:22,600 --> 01:08:25,478
- You have examined these stains?
- I have, sir.

870
01:08:25,640 --> 01:08:28,677
- Would you tell the court what they are?
- They're human blood.

871
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:32,197
- Would you tell us what blood type?
- Type O, sir.

872
01:08:32,360 --> 01:08:35,557
Is this the same blood type
as that of the murdered man?

873
01:08:35,720 --> 01:08:38,154
- It is, sir.
- Thank you, doctor.

874
01:08:41,200 --> 01:08:44,510
On the night of the murder,
you spoke to the accused?

875
01:08:44,680 --> 01:08:47,831
At what time did your conversation
take place?

876
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:50,594
A little after 11:45, sir.

877
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:55,470
Would you tell the court of the events
that led up to this conversation?

878
01:08:55,640 --> 01:08:56,959
Yes, sir.

879
01:08:57,800 --> 01:09:02,351
My wife was asleep, sir,
and I was just about to go to bed.

880
01:09:02,520 --> 01:09:07,355
I happened to look out the window,
and I saw someone enter the church.

881
01:09:07,880 --> 01:09:11,270
I couldn't tell who it was
at that distance...

882
01:09:11,440 --> 01:09:14,557
...so I went downstairs
and through the passageway...

883
01:09:14,720 --> 01:09:17,280
...that connects the rectory
to the church.

884
01:09:17,440 --> 01:09:21,433
The light was dim, sir,
but I could see someone...

885
01:09:21,600 --> 01:09:25,036
...who was kneeling
against the altar rail.

886
01:09:25,480 --> 01:09:27,072
As he lifted his head...

887
01:09:27,240 --> 01:09:30,277
...I recognized Father Logan, sir.

888
01:09:32,280 --> 01:09:36,353
Was there anything about his manner
that seemed out of the ordinary?

889
01:09:37,320 --> 01:09:38,799
He seemed...

890
01:09:39,600 --> 01:09:41,318
...distressed, sir.

891
01:09:41,480 --> 01:09:46,235
- Did you speak to him?
- Yes, sir. I asked him if he were ill.

892
01:09:46,800 --> 01:09:51,032
He said no. He said I should go back
and leave him alone.

893
01:09:51,440 --> 01:09:54,910
- But you didn't leave him immediately?
- No, sir.

894
01:09:55,080 --> 01:09:56,638
Why was that?

895
01:09:58,120 --> 01:10:02,557
Father Logan had always been very kind
to my wife and to me...

896
01:10:02,720 --> 01:10:04,836
...so I wanted to help him if I could.

897
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:06,911
He seemed to need help?

898
01:10:07,080 --> 01:10:11,198
He seemed very, very distressed, sir.

899
01:10:12,040 --> 01:10:13,837
And he wouldn't let you help him?

900
01:10:14,200 --> 01:10:18,432
No, sir. He said to me again,
"Go back, Keller. Leave me alone."

901
01:10:18,760 --> 01:10:21,149
So I went back to my room.

902
01:10:24,520 --> 01:10:27,751
You spoke to your wife
of this incident?

903
01:10:27,920 --> 01:10:29,399
No, sir.

904
01:10:30,120 --> 01:10:33,112
- Why not?
- She was asleep, sir.

905
01:10:33,280 --> 01:10:37,717
And also I didn't like
to talk about it.

906
01:10:39,040 --> 01:10:40,917
It didn't seem right to me...

907
01:10:41,080 --> 01:10:45,756
...to mention such distress
as Father Logan's to anyone.

908
01:10:45,920 --> 01:10:49,151
It seemed a very private distress, sir.

909
01:10:50,440 --> 01:10:53,352
I'm only trying to clarify
your testimony.

910
01:10:53,520 --> 01:10:55,750
I've told you everything
you need to know.

911
01:10:55,920 --> 01:10:57,638
That is hardly for you to decide.

912
01:10:57,800 --> 01:11:01,509
Madame Grandfort, will you please
answer my questions, "yes" or "no"?

913
01:11:01,680 --> 01:11:04,956
Some questions cannot
be answered that way.

914
01:11:05,200 --> 01:11:09,159
Well, I'll try to rephrase it.
I'll try to help you.

915
01:11:09,520 --> 01:11:12,512
Is it true that you had an association
with the accused...

916
01:11:12,680 --> 01:11:15,069
...which you didn't wish
to become public knowledge?

917
01:11:15,240 --> 01:11:17,959
You're twisting my words.
You haven't listened to me.

918
01:11:18,240 --> 01:11:21,630
The witness will confine herself
to answer as to the facts.

919
01:11:21,960 --> 01:11:25,748
Madame Grandfort, let me repeat
your answer to my earlier question.

920
01:11:25,920 --> 01:11:30,869
You said that you were in love with
the accused before the war. Am I right?

921
01:11:31,320 --> 01:11:32,719
Yes.

922
01:11:32,880 --> 01:11:35,075
Then were you in love with him...

923
01:11:35,240 --> 01:11:37,754
...at the time of your marriage
to Monsieur Grandfort?

924
01:11:37,920 --> 01:11:39,751
- I object, my lord.
- I refuse to answer.

925
01:11:39,920 --> 01:11:42,388
- You have no right.
- Objection overruled.

926
01:11:42,560 --> 01:11:45,313
We have your signed testimony
as to your relationship.

927
01:11:45,480 --> 01:11:47,994
Do you wish that testimony
read to this court?

928
01:11:53,960 --> 01:11:56,030
Then were you in love
with the accused...

929
01:11:56,200 --> 01:11:59,237
...at the time of your marriage
to Monsieur Grandfort?

930
01:12:01,520 --> 01:12:04,398
- Yes.
- And still in love with him...

931
01:12:04,560 --> 01:12:06,630
...on the night of the murder?

932
01:12:14,040 --> 01:12:15,268
Yes.

933
01:12:16,520 --> 01:12:20,752
Then isn't it possible that you met
with him between the night...

934
01:12:20,920 --> 01:12:23,593
...at the summerhouse and the night
Villette was killed?

935
01:12:23,760 --> 01:12:24,988
I did not.

936
01:12:25,360 --> 01:12:27,828
You can hardly expect
the jury to believe...

937
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:30,639
...that a woman in love doesn't
attempt to meet her lover.

938
01:12:30,800 --> 01:12:31,994
I object, my lord.

939
01:12:32,160 --> 01:12:34,833
This line of questioning
doesn't seem particularly relevant.

940
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:38,549
It is, my lord. I'm trying
to establish a motive for the murder.

941
01:12:38,720 --> 01:12:40,756
I'm trying to discover
if Villette's blackmail...

942
01:12:40,920 --> 01:12:44,037
...was based on his knowledge
not merely of one night at his home...

943
01:12:44,200 --> 01:12:46,589
...but also of a continuous,
uninterrupted, illicit...

944
01:12:46,760 --> 01:12:50,799
- No, that's not true! Not true!
- Silence! Silence!

945
01:12:53,560 --> 01:12:57,473
Father Logan, will you
examine this garment?

946
01:13:03,360 --> 01:13:05,032
Is this your cassock?

947
01:13:05,400 --> 01:13:06,628
No, sir.

948
01:13:06,840 --> 01:13:10,913
- Then did you borrow this cassock?
- No.

949
01:13:11,400 --> 01:13:14,198
It's not yours,
and you did not borrow it.

950
01:13:14,360 --> 01:13:16,669
And yet it was found in your trunk.

951
01:13:16,840 --> 01:13:19,673
- Someone must have put it there.
- Yes.

952
01:13:20,960 --> 01:13:24,714
Have you any idea who might have
put this cassock in your trunk?

953
01:13:27,400 --> 01:13:29,277
I can't say.

954
01:13:31,880 --> 01:13:34,917
Father Logan, when did you decide
to become a priest?

955
01:13:35,080 --> 01:13:36,308
After the war.

956
01:13:36,480 --> 01:13:41,508
In becoming a priest, were you,
perhaps, trying to hide from something?

957
01:13:41,680 --> 01:13:44,752
I had never thought of the priesthood
as offering a hiding place.

958
01:13:44,920 --> 01:13:49,311
I understand you to mean that priesthood
involves certain responsibilities...

959
01:13:49,480 --> 01:13:51,232
...certain moralities.
- Yes.

960
01:13:51,400 --> 01:13:54,756
You were aware of these
responsibilities, these moralities?

961
01:13:54,920 --> 01:13:56,194
Yes.

962
01:13:56,360 --> 01:13:58,351
Yet you saw nothing wrong...

963
01:13:58,520 --> 01:14:01,239
...in having a clandestine meeting
with a woman?

964
01:14:01,400 --> 01:14:04,517
Are you trying to imply that I was
a priest at that time? I was not.

965
01:14:04,680 --> 01:14:07,797
Did you take into consideration
that this woman was married?

966
01:14:07,960 --> 01:14:10,155
I wasn't aware that she was.

967
01:14:10,440 --> 01:14:13,637
And so you spent the whole day
with this woman?

968
01:14:13,800 --> 01:14:18,078
Yes. We were good friends.
I hadn't seen her in over two years.

969
01:14:18,240 --> 01:14:21,596
Such good friends that you spent
the night with her?

970
01:14:21,760 --> 01:14:26,276
- We were caught in a storm.
- Oh, the storm was the villain.

971
01:14:26,520 --> 01:14:30,149
Did you warn Madame Grandfort that
her husband might not agree on that?

972
01:14:30,320 --> 01:14:33,073
As I said,
I didn't know she was married.

973
01:14:33,240 --> 01:14:34,912
On discovering that she was...

974
01:14:35,080 --> 01:14:38,550
...did you make any attempt to explain
the situation to Monsieur Grandfort?

975
01:14:38,720 --> 01:14:39,948
No.

976
01:14:40,520 --> 01:14:42,750
But surely there is
some contradiction...

977
01:14:42,920 --> 01:14:47,072
...between this secretiveness
and your vocation.

978
01:14:47,480 --> 01:14:50,597
I saw nothing wrong
with being caught in a storm.

979
01:14:50,920 --> 01:14:52,273
If there was nothing wrong...

980
01:14:52,440 --> 01:14:55,910
...why did you have such a violent
argument with Villette the next morning?

981
01:14:56,080 --> 01:14:59,231
Were you anxious to protect
Madame Grandfort's reputation?

982
01:14:59,400 --> 01:15:00,674
Yes.

983
01:15:00,960 --> 01:15:03,030
Then her reputation was in danger?

984
01:15:03,200 --> 01:15:07,716
You realized there was something more
than merely being caught in the storm?

985
01:15:07,880 --> 01:15:10,110
Villette made an insinuation.

986
01:15:10,280 --> 01:15:13,795
My argument with Villette had nothing
to do with any sudden realization.

987
01:15:13,960 --> 01:15:15,871
- And you hit him?
- Yes, I did.

988
01:15:16,040 --> 01:15:18,190
- In anger?
- Yes.

989
01:15:18,360 --> 01:15:19,952
You're capable of hitting a man...

990
01:15:20,120 --> 01:15:22,236
...who merely intrudes
upon a harmless situation.

991
01:15:22,760 --> 01:15:25,957
Then surely you are capable
of far more violent action...

992
01:15:26,120 --> 01:15:29,908
...when that same man blackmails
your good friend Madame Grandfort.

993
01:15:30,080 --> 01:15:33,231
- I'm not capable of murder.
- You would allow such a man...

994
01:15:33,400 --> 01:15:36,915
...to destroy Madame Grandfort's home
and your career?

995
01:15:37,440 --> 01:15:38,668
No.

996
01:15:38,840 --> 01:15:42,116
You would go to such a man and,
unable to control your temper...

997
01:15:42,440 --> 01:15:45,477
...unable to face a public scandal,
you'd turn to physical force.

998
01:15:45,640 --> 01:15:46,914
No, I would not!

999
01:15:50,200 --> 01:15:51,758
Silence! Silence!

1000
01:15:53,640 --> 01:15:57,394
You and Madame Grandfort separated
at 11:00 on the night of the murder.

1001
01:15:57,560 --> 01:15:58,788
That's right. Yes.

1002
01:15:58,960 --> 01:16:01,952
Then it was possible for you
to go to Villette's house.

1003
01:16:02,120 --> 01:16:05,635
It was possible for you to arrive there
at 11:30, the time he was murdered.

1004
01:16:05,800 --> 01:16:09,156
Yes, it was possible,
but I didn't go there.

1005
01:16:09,320 --> 01:16:11,470
I went right home to the rectory.

1006
01:16:12,360 --> 01:16:15,193
And what time did you arrive
at the rectory?

1007
01:16:15,360 --> 01:16:16,793
About 11: 15.

1008
01:16:16,960 --> 01:16:20,350
- Did anybody witness this arrival?
- I don't believe so.

1009
01:16:20,680 --> 01:16:23,478
You say you arrived at 11: 15.

1010
01:16:23,640 --> 01:16:26,757
- What did you do then?
- I went up to my room.

1011
01:16:26,920 --> 01:16:29,195
- You went to bed immediately?
- No.

1012
01:16:29,360 --> 01:16:33,319
- What did you do?
- I went into the church.

1013
01:16:33,800 --> 01:16:37,315
- Did you see anybody there?
- Otto Keller.

1014
01:16:38,560 --> 01:16:41,518
Otto Keller has testified
to this court that he followed you...

1015
01:16:41,680 --> 01:16:45,275
...and that he found you kneeling
before the altar in great distress.

1016
01:16:45,440 --> 01:16:49,638
He has further testified that the time
was then 11:45 or after.

1017
01:16:49,800 --> 01:16:53,759
Well, it could have been 11:45.
The rest isn't true.

1018
01:16:54,280 --> 01:16:57,795
Perhaps you are prepared,
at last, to tell us the truth.

1019
01:16:58,320 --> 01:17:02,438
It might have been 11:45.
The rest is not true.

1020
01:17:02,600 --> 01:17:05,910
Perhaps you are prepared
to give us your version of the truth.

1021
01:17:07,080 --> 01:17:09,230
Of course you refuse to answer...

1022
01:17:09,400 --> 01:17:12,676
...because I submit you did not return
to the rectory at 11: 15.

1023
01:17:12,840 --> 01:17:15,229
You did not return
until 11:45 or after.

1024
01:17:15,400 --> 01:17:18,198
Your distress, seen by Otto Keller,
was caused by the fact...

1025
01:17:18,360 --> 01:17:21,591
...that you had earlier met with
Villette and been threatened by him...

1026
01:17:21,760 --> 01:17:24,194
...with exposure of your affair
with Madame Grandfort.

1027
01:17:24,360 --> 01:17:27,557
And that you'd taken the first weapon
you found and struck Villette...

1028
01:17:27,720 --> 01:17:30,712
...and continued to strike
until you cracked his skull wide open.

1029
01:17:30,880 --> 01:17:32,199
No!

1030
01:17:34,280 --> 01:17:36,191
I repeat, it's your duty...

1031
01:17:36,360 --> 01:17:39,477
...to carefully examine
all the evidence that's been given...

1032
01:17:39,640 --> 01:17:43,713
...and to determine whether the charge
against the accused has been proven.

1033
01:17:44,120 --> 01:17:47,430
Remember also that you are not
trying the accused...

1034
01:17:47,600 --> 01:17:49,830
...for whatever views you may hold...

1035
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:52,833
...as to his relationship
with Madame Grandfort...

1036
01:17:53,000 --> 01:17:56,197
...except as it may affect
this charge of murder.

1037
01:17:56,560 --> 01:17:58,118
One final point.

1038
01:17:58,280 --> 01:18:01,955
The fact that the accused
is a priest under holy orders...

1039
01:18:02,120 --> 01:18:05,795
...should not influence your verdict
one way or the other.

1040
01:18:06,400 --> 01:18:10,109
You may now withdraw
to consider your verdict.

1041
01:18:36,680 --> 01:18:38,910
But I believe what
the prosecutor said.

1042
01:18:39,080 --> 01:18:42,356
Obviously, they didn't spend
just that one night together.

1043
01:18:42,520 --> 01:18:45,159
There must have been many more times.

1044
01:19:27,520 --> 01:19:29,954
Gentlemen of the jury,
are you agreed on your verdict?

1045
01:19:30,120 --> 01:19:33,157
- And who will speak for you?
- We are.

1046
01:19:33,320 --> 01:19:36,995
How say you? Is Michael William Logan
guilty of murder or not guilty?

1047
01:19:37,160 --> 01:19:39,993
While we attach grave suspicion
to the accused...

1048
01:19:40,440 --> 01:19:42,954
...we cannot find sufficient evidence
to prove...

1049
01:19:43,120 --> 01:19:46,669
...he actually wielded the weapon
that killed Monsieur Villette.

1050
01:19:46,840 --> 01:19:50,116
Therefore, our verdict is not guilty.

1051
01:19:54,920 --> 01:19:57,275
Hearken to your verdict
as the court recorded it.

1052
01:19:57,440 --> 01:20:01,479
You say Michael William Logan
is not guilty, so you say all.

1053
01:20:01,640 --> 01:20:03,039
- Yes.
- Yes.

1054
01:20:11,800 --> 01:20:13,711
- I said that cassock...
- They've ruined him.

1055
01:20:13,880 --> 01:20:16,758
Why couldn't they have said
"not guilty" and let it go at that?

1056
01:20:16,920 --> 01:20:19,718
Your Lordship, I move that
the prisoner be released.

1057
01:20:20,360 --> 01:20:23,079
Michael Logan, while I have
no doubt that the jury...

1058
01:20:23,240 --> 01:20:26,710
...must have reached their conclusion
in utmost fairness...

1059
01:20:26,880 --> 01:20:28,836
...and solemn regard for justice...

1060
01:20:29,000 --> 01:20:33,278
...I cannot help expressing my personal
disagreement with their verdict.

1061
01:20:33,440 --> 01:20:36,557
Michael William Logan,
you are hereby discharged.

1062
01:20:36,880 --> 01:20:38,438
Everybody stand up.

1063
01:20:48,840 --> 01:20:50,114
Michael.

1064
01:21:00,520 --> 01:21:02,272
Take off that collar!

1065
01:21:45,240 --> 01:21:47,549
Preach us a sermon, Logan!

1066
01:22:08,840 --> 01:22:12,674
Are you satisfied, Willy?
Are you satisfied with all this?

1067
01:22:12,840 --> 01:22:14,398
Do you think I've enjoyed it?

1068
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:35,558
Alma. Alma!

1069
01:22:38,640 --> 01:22:40,995
Alma, come here! Alma!

1070
01:22:44,400 --> 01:22:45,628
Alma...

1071
01:22:45,800 --> 01:22:47,119
Stop it!

1072
01:22:47,280 --> 01:22:48,998
He's innocent.

1073
01:22:52,360 --> 01:22:53,634
My husb...

1074
01:23:04,080 --> 01:23:05,911
There he goes!
In the hotel.

1075
01:23:12,720 --> 01:23:14,676
All right. Quick, get a doctor.

1076
01:23:25,400 --> 01:23:26,879
It hurts.

1077
01:23:27,480 --> 01:23:30,278
- Could we move her inside?
- She should not be moved at all.

1078
01:23:30,440 --> 01:23:33,637
She shouted something. What is it
you were shouting, Mrs. Keller?

1079
01:23:33,800 --> 01:23:35,870
She said he was innocent.

1080
01:23:39,240 --> 01:23:41,310
- Villette...
- Villette?

1081
01:23:41,760 --> 01:23:44,194
What about Villette, Mrs. Keller?

1082
01:23:52,080 --> 01:23:54,992
What? What is it?

1083
01:23:55,480 --> 01:23:57,118
What is she saying?

1084
01:23:57,800 --> 01:23:59,518
She says, "Forgive me."

1085
01:24:12,520 --> 01:24:14,431
- Mr. Larrue.
- Have you got Keller?

1086
01:24:14,600 --> 01:24:16,955
He just ran
in the Chateau Frontenac, sir.

1087
01:24:17,120 --> 01:24:19,031
Get Farouche and his squad.
Corrigan too.

1088
01:24:19,200 --> 01:24:22,192
- Murphy, I do not want him to be shot.
- But, sir, he's got a gun.

1089
01:24:22,360 --> 01:24:25,477
I know, I know. I don't want him dead.
I want to talk to him.

1090
01:24:28,840 --> 01:24:30,956
- She's gone.
- Come along, Father.

1091
01:24:31,120 --> 01:24:33,475
- Now, what about this Keller?
- What do you mean?

1092
01:24:33,640 --> 01:24:37,474
He shot his wife. What was she doing?
Was she trying to warn you or save you?

1093
01:24:37,640 --> 01:24:40,757
Keller works as Villette's gardener.
He also works in the rectory.

1094
01:24:40,920 --> 01:24:44,515
- What more can you tell me about him?
- Let me try and talk to him, inspector.

1095
01:24:44,680 --> 01:24:47,069
Talk to him, sure. Go ahead.
But where is he?

1096
01:25:01,240 --> 01:25:03,754
Couldn't we have one entrance open?
At least one?

1097
01:25:03,920 --> 01:25:08,948
No. No. Keep these people right where
they are for their own safety, please.

1098
01:25:09,680 --> 01:25:11,671
Start in the basement
and work your way up.

1099
01:25:11,840 --> 01:25:14,912
Remember, I said, no shooting.
Now, go ahead.

1100
01:25:49,000 --> 01:25:51,070
Get an ambulance at once.

1101
01:25:51,280 --> 01:25:53,999
Well, he just shot a man,
a chef in the kitchen.

1102
01:25:54,400 --> 01:25:56,994
Now will you tell me anything
about him, Father?

1103
01:25:58,200 --> 01:26:00,873
Father, what are you trying to do?
Protect this Keller?

1104
01:26:01,040 --> 01:26:02,758
He's on the mezzanine going upstairs.

1105
01:26:03,720 --> 01:26:05,199
In the ballroom.

1106
01:26:21,000 --> 01:26:22,433
Tell Larrue.

1107
01:26:39,520 --> 01:26:41,954
Keller! Give yourself up!

1108
01:26:42,760 --> 01:26:43,988
Stay back!

1109
01:26:44,160 --> 01:26:46,116
Have them send over some tear gas.

1110
01:26:47,960 --> 01:26:50,633
- Keller!
- Inspector, let me go in.

1111
01:26:50,800 --> 01:26:52,836
Let me try and talk to him.

1112
01:26:53,280 --> 01:26:54,508
No.

1113
01:26:54,960 --> 01:26:57,997
- Keller!
- What do you want, inspector?

1114
01:26:58,160 --> 01:26:59,798
I want you to give yourself up.

1115
01:27:00,320 --> 01:27:03,869
- Why would I do that?
- Haven't you done enough harm?

1116
01:27:04,040 --> 01:27:06,235
I could do more, inspector.

1117
01:27:06,440 --> 01:27:09,398
You've already shot two people.
Isn't that enough?

1118
01:27:12,040 --> 01:27:14,076
And what about Villette?

1119
01:27:15,560 --> 01:27:18,279
- Villette?
- Yes, what about Villette?

1120
01:27:20,040 --> 01:27:22,315
So the priest talked.

1121
01:27:23,720 --> 01:27:28,475
Hey, Logan!
Where are you, Father Logan?

1122
01:27:28,640 --> 01:27:29,959
Keller.

1123
01:27:30,200 --> 01:27:31,792
There you are.

1124
01:27:32,240 --> 01:27:35,869
My only friend, Father Logan.

1125
01:27:36,560 --> 01:27:39,791
How kindly he hears my confession...

1126
01:27:39,960 --> 01:27:43,635
...and then a little shame,
a little violence...

1127
01:27:43,800 --> 01:27:46,553
...that's all it takes
to make him talk.

1128
01:27:46,720 --> 01:27:49,598
It was too much for you, huh?

1129
01:27:50,400 --> 01:27:54,598
You are a coward
like all other people, aren't you?

1130
01:27:54,760 --> 01:27:57,274
A hypocrite like all the rest.

1131
01:27:57,600 --> 01:27:59,318
Pierre, take me home.

1132
01:28:03,280 --> 01:28:06,397
Frank, try to get him in the shoulder,
make him drop that gun.

1133
01:28:06,560 --> 01:28:09,916
- It'd be easier to get him in the leg.
- His shoulder. The right shoulder.

1134
01:28:10,080 --> 01:28:13,152
- We're going to shoot now, Keller.
- Don't make them do it!

1135
01:28:18,040 --> 01:28:19,519
Father, don't go in...

1136
01:28:20,320 --> 01:28:22,754
Coming to speak to me?

1137
01:28:25,280 --> 01:28:28,636
Put the gun away. There's been
enough bloodshed already.

1138
01:28:29,440 --> 01:28:32,193
You must not come closer, Father.

1139
01:28:33,960 --> 01:28:36,190
I'll shoot you, you know.

1140
01:28:39,960 --> 01:28:41,678
You won't shoot me, Otto.

1141
01:28:41,840 --> 01:28:45,958
Why will I not shoot you?
Because you call me Otto...

1142
01:28:47,520 --> 01:28:51,752
...in such a friendly way,
like Alma used to call me Otto?

1143
01:28:52,880 --> 01:28:54,711
Where is my Alma?

1144
01:28:56,320 --> 01:28:58,595
- She's dead.
- No.

1145
01:28:58,760 --> 01:29:01,991
- You killed her.
- It is your fault.

1146
01:29:02,160 --> 01:29:04,037
Oh, I loved her.

1147
01:29:05,360 --> 01:29:08,352
It made me cry to see her work so hard.

1148
01:29:09,960 --> 01:29:13,873
Those poor hands.
Such beautiful hands.

1149
01:29:15,720 --> 01:29:18,188
- She can't be dead.
- She is.

1150
01:29:18,600 --> 01:29:22,275
Then I am as alone as you are.

1151
01:29:22,880 --> 01:29:25,917
- I'm not alone.
- Oh, yes, you are.

1152
01:29:26,920 --> 01:29:30,117
To kill you now
would be a favor to you.

1153
01:29:30,280 --> 01:29:32,316
You have no friends.

1154
01:29:33,080 --> 01:29:36,516
What has happened
to your friends, Father?

1155
01:29:36,840 --> 01:29:39,752
They mob you. They call at you.

1156
01:29:40,840 --> 01:29:45,516
It would be better
if you were as guilty as I am.

1157
01:29:45,840 --> 01:29:48,832
Then they would shoot you quickly...

1158
01:29:49,000 --> 01:29:51,560
...and you mustn't suffer much.

1159
01:29:51,880 --> 01:29:53,598
Look...

1160
01:29:54,080 --> 01:29:55,195
Oh, Father.

1161
01:29:56,200 --> 01:29:58,111
Help me. Quickly.

1162
01:29:58,280 --> 01:30:00,840
- Get the hotel doctor.
- And the ambulance?

1163
01:30:01,000 --> 01:30:02,797
Forgive me.

1164
01:30:37,440 --> 01:30:39,431
