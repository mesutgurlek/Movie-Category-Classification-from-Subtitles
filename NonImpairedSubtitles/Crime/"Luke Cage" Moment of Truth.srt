3
00:01:34,553 --> 00:01:38,765
[Pop] They lose 65 games only to end
up with the fourth pick in the draft.

4
00:01:38,849 --> 00:01:40,892
Did they tank that shit on purpose?

5
00:01:40,976 --> 00:01:43,562
Read the words, Pop. Right
there on the wall.

6
00:01:43,645 --> 00:01:46,523
Brother's got a point, Henry,
much as I hate to admit that.

7
00:01:46,607 --> 00:01:48,149
That's right. Pay up.

8
00:01:48,233 --> 00:01:50,276
You're right, you're
right. I shouldn't have cursed.

9
00:01:51,945 --> 00:01:53,947
- My bad, Lonnie.
- It's okay, Pop.

10
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:55,031
[Pop chuckles] All right.

11
00:01:55,115 --> 00:01:57,325
What's their record this
year, anyway, like?

12
00:01:57,408 --> 00:01:58,869
[Pop] 17 and 65.

13
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:02,456
You know that Russian kid they
drafted? He better be good.

14
00:02:02,539 --> 00:02:03,790
He's Latvian.

15
00:02:03,874 --> 00:02:06,167
What they need to do
is fire Phil Jackson.

16
00:02:06,251 --> 00:02:08,688
[Pop] Wait a minute, Phil Jackson
ain't out there playing no more.

17
00:02:08,712 --> 00:02:10,464
Phil Jackson overrated, B.

18
00:02:10,547 --> 00:02:12,591
Anybody can win with Jordan and Kobe.

19
00:02:12,674 --> 00:02:15,343
Phil ain't no Pat Riley.

20
00:02:15,426 --> 00:02:17,513
- [all groaning]
- Aw, Riley, again?

21
00:02:17,596 --> 00:02:18,639
- [Pop] Yeah.
- Here we go.

22
00:02:18,722 --> 00:02:20,265
[Chico] I mean, Pacino...

23
00:02:20,348 --> 00:02:22,726
Now, I get why that white
boy makes your free haircut list.

24
00:02:22,809 --> 00:02:28,398
The Godfather and Scarface guaranteed
that man an eternal ghetto pass.

25
00:02:28,482 --> 00:02:29,584
- Carlito's Way, too.
- [Shameek] Mmm-hmm.

26
00:02:29,608 --> 00:02:31,317
- [Chico] But Pat Riley?
- [Pop] Yeah.

27
00:02:31,401 --> 00:02:33,420
[Chico] Why does Pat Riley get
so much love in this shop?

28
00:02:33,444 --> 00:02:37,240
Right. Even punk-ass Derek
Fisher got more rings than Pat Riley.

29
00:02:37,323 --> 00:02:38,408
Uh-uh.

30
00:02:38,492 --> 00:02:39,618
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

31
00:02:39,701 --> 00:02:42,871
'Cause the Knicks played like
men when Pat Riley was head coach.

32
00:02:42,954 --> 00:02:45,123
Oakley and Ewing went hard in the paint.

33
00:02:45,206 --> 00:02:47,626
Plus Anthony Mason and John Starks?

34
00:02:47,709 --> 00:02:50,336
Drive the lane, you might
go home in a body bag.

35
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:51,963
All right, now I heard that.

36
00:02:52,047 --> 00:02:53,715
Later with all that Instagramming,

37
00:02:53,799 --> 00:02:56,176
"let's all max contract on the
same team together" bullcrap

38
00:02:56,259 --> 00:02:58,154
- passing as competition nowadays.
- [all laughing]

39
00:02:58,178 --> 00:02:59,846
[Pop laughs] Mmm. Yeah.

40
00:02:59,930 --> 00:03:03,016
[scoffs] Didn't Pat Riley sign those
Instagram dudes down in Miami

41
00:03:03,099 --> 00:03:04,851
when he became the GM?

42
00:03:04,935 --> 00:03:06,477
[scoffs] Maybe.

43
00:03:07,478 --> 00:03:10,691
But King James is the
truth. LeBron can ball.

44
00:03:10,774 --> 00:03:12,568
[Pop chuckles] Yeah.

45
00:03:12,651 --> 00:03:14,903
Now pay up, Luke. You said "bullcrap."

46
00:03:14,986 --> 00:03:17,405
"Bullcrap" ain't a
curse, man. I don't curse.

47
00:03:17,488 --> 00:03:19,658
- [imitating Luke] "I don't curse."
- [laughs]

48
00:03:19,741 --> 00:03:21,284
You don't cut hair either, negro.

49
00:03:21,367 --> 00:03:24,454
Like, really, what do
you do up in here, bruh?

50
00:03:24,537 --> 00:03:26,832
I sweep hair, Shameek.

51
00:03:26,915 --> 00:03:29,751
I also mop, I wash the towels,

52
00:03:29,835 --> 00:03:32,629
and I make sure that plate
glass window stays spotless.

53
00:03:32,713 --> 00:03:35,882
It's called work. Something
you would never understand.

54
00:03:35,966 --> 00:03:37,050
[scoffs]

55
00:03:38,635 --> 00:03:41,304
Slam Magazine... Hmm?

56
00:03:42,513 --> 00:03:44,725
Coaches used to live
up in this piece, son.

57
00:03:45,601 --> 00:03:48,103
Kevin Ollie got a
shape-up right there from Pop's.

58
00:03:48,186 --> 00:03:49,395
Pitino, too.

59
00:03:50,939 --> 00:03:54,150
Stylin' and profilin', that's my work.

60
00:03:54,234 --> 00:03:56,152
- See what I'm sayin'? Yeah?
- Yeah. Tell him.

61
00:03:56,236 --> 00:03:57,696
For real?

62
00:03:59,405 --> 00:04:01,116
Doc Rivers, uh, call you yet, Shameek?

63
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:03,118
[chuckling] Whoa, all right. Play nice.

64
00:04:03,201 --> 00:04:06,079
- You can't even afford a haircut.
- [Shameek] Hey, you know what?

65
00:04:06,162 --> 00:04:08,039
- I'm about sick and tired of...
- [Luke] What?

66
00:04:09,833 --> 00:04:11,752
Hmm?

67
00:04:11,835 --> 00:04:13,461
You sick and tired of what?

68
00:04:16,757 --> 00:04:20,093
About sick and tired of the
Knicks losin' all the time, man!

69
00:04:21,052 --> 00:04:22,303
- [Shameek sighs]
- [chuckles]

70
00:04:22,387 --> 00:04:23,805
[chuckling]

71
00:04:23,889 --> 00:04:26,516
You got some hair, too, right there.

72
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:29,019
- I'm not finished.
- Yes, you are.

73
00:04:29,102 --> 00:04:30,228
[door opens and bell dings]

74
00:04:31,229 --> 00:04:34,107
- Hey, Counselor.
- Aw, don't jinx me, Pop.

75
00:04:34,190 --> 00:04:36,401
I haven't even passed the bar yet.

76
00:04:37,152 --> 00:04:39,070
- Oh, you will.
- [chuckles]

77
00:04:39,154 --> 00:04:41,782
Lonnie, you got Kumon tonight. Let's go.

78
00:04:41,865 --> 00:04:44,159
Come on, boy, you heard your mama.

79
00:04:44,242 --> 00:04:45,326
Let's get moving.

80
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:47,578
Don't make me repeat myself.

81
00:04:48,538 --> 00:04:49,623
[chuckles]

82
00:04:53,001 --> 00:04:54,169
Hey, Luke.

83
00:04:55,295 --> 00:04:56,755
What time you get off?

84
00:04:59,966 --> 00:05:02,385
I got another job I go to
right after I leave this one.

85
00:05:02,468 --> 00:05:06,389
[sighs] Black man working. Ain't
nothing wrong with that.

86
00:05:06,472 --> 00:05:10,518
[inhales] Well, we should at least
try to get some coffee some time.

87
00:05:22,572 --> 00:05:24,700
Maybe you'll need a lawyer one day.

88
00:05:25,826 --> 00:05:28,286
Hopefully, you'll have
some cards by then.

89
00:05:28,369 --> 00:05:29,663
[chuckles]

90
00:05:31,622 --> 00:05:32,749
[Pop chuckles] Hey.

91
00:05:32,833 --> 00:05:34,960
Be sure and tell Bessie I said hey.

92
00:05:35,043 --> 00:05:36,795
- I will.
- Mmm-hmm.

93
00:05:45,136 --> 00:05:47,848
How's a woman that fine with a briefcase

94
00:05:47,931 --> 00:05:50,141
gonna throw it at a
brother with a broom?

95
00:05:50,225 --> 00:05:52,185
That's what you don't get, youngin.

96
00:05:52,268 --> 00:05:54,062
Either you have it or you don't.

97
00:05:54,145 --> 00:05:56,189
- [chuckling]
- Oh, I know I got it.

98
00:05:56,272 --> 00:05:58,483
Shit. [indistinct muttering]

99
00:05:58,566 --> 00:06:01,444
[Pop] Whoa, whoa. See the
words... right there on the wall.

100
00:06:01,527 --> 00:06:03,947
- [scoffs]
- Hmm?

101
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:06,783
- [Pop] Pay up.
- Come on, Pop.

102
00:06:06,867 --> 00:06:08,744
[dryer whirring]

103
00:06:23,884 --> 00:06:26,302
[Pop] Huh, there you go again.

104
00:06:27,512 --> 00:06:30,598
I shook everything else after I got out.

105
00:06:30,681 --> 00:06:33,184
Cigarettes, paranoia...

106
00:06:33,268 --> 00:06:34,978
But the pacing?

107
00:06:35,061 --> 00:06:38,356
I do it, too. [grunts softly]

108
00:06:39,607 --> 00:06:40,984
Reva again?

109
00:06:41,943 --> 00:06:43,236
Reva always.

110
00:06:47,908 --> 00:06:49,617
Look, it's been long enough.

111
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:52,328
Give Patty a call. She's a good woman.

112
00:06:52,412 --> 00:06:53,496
[scoffs]

113
00:06:54,414 --> 00:06:56,041
I don't drink coffee much.

114
00:06:57,458 --> 00:06:58,709
I don't think she does either.

115
00:06:58,794 --> 00:07:01,838
[chuckles] Like she said, "Ain't
nothing wrong with that."

116
00:07:03,464 --> 00:07:05,341
When I'm ready, I'm ready.

117
00:07:05,425 --> 00:07:10,221
But you'll want a cup of something
hot and dark sooner or later...

118
00:07:10,305 --> 00:07:12,182
Mr. Bulletproof.

119
00:07:12,265 --> 00:07:15,101
- [chuckling]
- There you go with the nicknames, Pop.

120
00:07:15,185 --> 00:07:19,564
You said your rebound chick took
a shotgun at point-blank range...

121
00:07:20,273 --> 00:07:22,317
pointed it under your chin,

122
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:24,152
and pulled the trigger.

123
00:07:24,235 --> 00:07:26,029
I still get the occasional headache.

124
00:07:26,112 --> 00:07:27,823
Not a problem for you, Power Man.

125
00:07:27,906 --> 00:07:29,449
[chuckling]

126
00:07:30,533 --> 00:07:32,160
[Luke grunts]

127
00:07:35,121 --> 00:07:37,373
Mmm-mmm. [chuckles]

128
00:07:38,416 --> 00:07:41,461
I love it when you do
stuff like that. [chuckling]

129
00:07:41,544 --> 00:07:43,880
You should be out there helping
people, that's all,

130
00:07:43,964 --> 00:07:45,882
like them other fellas downtown.

131
00:07:45,966 --> 00:07:47,467
Reva used to say the same thing.

132
00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:49,635
Yeah, well, she was right.

133
00:07:49,719 --> 00:07:52,555
You don't ever think about all
the people you could help?

134
00:07:52,638 --> 00:07:54,975
You should be more ambitious.

135
00:07:56,559 --> 00:07:59,896
What if my ambition is to sweep hair...

136
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:01,314
wash dishes...

137
00:08:02,232 --> 00:08:04,025
and be left the hell alone?

138
00:08:04,109 --> 00:08:06,194
Well, that would be a waste.

139
00:08:06,277 --> 00:08:08,071
You think I asked for any of this?

140
00:08:09,322 --> 00:08:12,158
I was framed, beaten...

141
00:08:12,242 --> 00:08:15,120
and put in some tank
like an exotic fish.

142
00:08:17,455 --> 00:08:20,041
Came out with...

143
00:08:20,125 --> 00:08:21,459
abilities.

144
00:08:21,542 --> 00:08:23,044
Saved your life.

145
00:08:23,128 --> 00:08:24,880
More like ruined it.

146
00:08:26,882 --> 00:08:28,758
Reva's dead. [exhales]

147
00:08:29,885 --> 00:08:31,344
I'm a fugitive.

148
00:08:31,427 --> 00:08:33,096
So?

149
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:35,723
Take my advice, brother.

150
00:08:36,557 --> 00:08:39,102
The past is the past.

151
00:08:39,185 --> 00:08:42,147
And the only direction in
life that matters is forward.

152
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:43,648
Never backwards.

153
00:08:45,441 --> 00:08:46,985
I'm just living my life...

154
00:08:47,944 --> 00:08:49,487
day to day.

155
00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:51,697
[hip-hop music playing over speakers]

156
00:08:58,204 --> 00:09:00,706
Why don't you watch
where you going, man?

157
00:09:11,592 --> 00:09:12,969
What's the gun for, Chico?

158
00:09:13,929 --> 00:09:16,890
[scoffs] Is your name Wilfredo Diaz?

159
00:09:17,891 --> 00:09:20,351
'Cause he walked out on me

- Yeah.

00:09:38,244 --> 00:09:39,537
Tsk.

164
00:09:43,374 --> 00:09:45,376
Hey, Pop, I gotta go. I'm runnin' late.

165
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:49,630
Hey. Look, if I wasn't paying you
in cash, I could be paying you more.

166
00:09:49,714 --> 00:09:52,092
You wouldn't have to
be workin' two jobs.

167
00:09:53,426 --> 00:09:55,011
I gotta do what I gotta do.

168
00:09:56,346 --> 00:09:57,805
Always forward.

169
00:09:57,888 --> 00:09:59,890
Forward. Always.

[vendor] Hey, yo, my man, my man.

173
00:10:22,705 --> 00:10:25,916
All HD. Got it right here. Blu-ray,
too, 'cause I'm nice like that.

don't mean Fenway.

You can't get better raw

- Hey, Luke.
- [Luke chuckles]

180
00:10:47,938 --> 00:10:49,232
Every time.

181
00:10:49,315 --> 00:10:52,360
It's the bleach. I can smell
it from around the corner.

182
00:10:52,443 --> 00:10:55,321
Pop has got you washing
towels again, huh?

183
00:10:57,115 --> 00:11:00,618
Yeah, I took a New
Yorker off the top for you.

184
00:11:00,701 --> 00:11:03,246
Can't tell you what's
on the cover, though.

185
00:11:03,329 --> 00:11:06,666
Hey, I hope you got Connie's rent money.

186
00:11:06,749 --> 00:11:08,084
She's on the warpath.

187
00:11:08,168 --> 00:11:09,502
- [chuckles]
- Thanks, Ollie.

188
00:11:10,378 --> 00:11:11,921
[Ollie] Mmm-hmm.

189
00:11:26,102 --> 00:11:29,522
Ten days late, Mr.
Cage. I need my rent money.

190
00:11:31,899 --> 00:11:33,068
[sighs]

191
00:11:39,865 --> 00:11:40,866
Here.

192
00:11:41,492 --> 00:11:43,911
I count $300. Not enough.

193
00:11:44,912 --> 00:11:46,664
Let me go to work and get the rest.

194
00:11:46,747 --> 00:11:48,124
Tonight.

I need a favor. Short one
bartender. Dante's sick.

200
00:13:28,349 --> 00:13:29,809
You got the cash you promised me?

201
00:13:29,892 --> 00:13:32,478
- End of the week.
- Come on, Nate.

202
00:13:32,562 --> 00:13:34,243
You can keep all your
tips out there, okay?

203
00:13:34,272 --> 00:13:35,707
When was the last time you made drinks?

204
00:13:35,731 --> 00:13:37,192
I know the drill.

205
00:13:37,275 --> 00:13:38,693
Okay, okay. Clean up.

206
00:13:38,776 --> 00:13:41,028
Put a shirt and jacket
on. Mr. Stokes has standards.

207
00:13:41,111 --> 00:13:42,697
Though you can't tell by what he pays.

208
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:43,948
Excuse me?

209

Raphael Saadiq.

210
00:14:03,593 --> 00:14:06,596
- He's as good live as you said he was.
- Even better.

211
00:14:09,807 --> 00:14:11,248
So you're not impressed by all this?

212
00:14:11,309 --> 00:14:13,686
I've always been proud of you.

213
00:14:13,769 --> 00:14:17,565
[Stokes] This place was a roach
trap by the time Mama Mabel died.

214
00:14:17,648 --> 00:14:19,024
Now look at it.

215
00:14:20,067 --> 00:14:24,405
Harlem's Paradise. May as
well be the new Cotton Club.

216
00:14:24,489 --> 00:14:26,407
Then I shouldn't be up in here tonight.

217
00:14:27,908 --> 00:14:29,785
Well...

218
00:14:29,869 --> 00:14:31,496
Madam Councilwoman...

219
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:36,083
Colon's Gym is ready to make a
sizable donation to my pocket...

220
00:14:36,166 --> 00:14:38,419
and your real estate project.

221
00:14:38,503 --> 00:14:40,546
Sometimes you need a face-to-face.

222
00:14:40,630 --> 00:14:42,382
"Colon's Gym"?

223
00:14:43,299 --> 00:14:46,636
Is that what that two-bit drug
dealer is puttin' on his tax returns?

224
00:14:46,719 --> 00:14:48,304
[laughs]

225
00:14:48,388 --> 00:14:49,972
Why do you even waste time with him?

226
00:14:51,807 --> 00:14:54,810
Politics is where the power is, Cornell.

227
00:14:54,894 --> 00:14:57,730
Forget about all this other noise.

228
00:14:57,813 --> 00:14:59,690
My noise keeps you flush.

229
00:15:00,691 --> 00:15:05,154
All that "keep Harlem black" rack-a-bully-ack
might get you re-elected.

230
00:15:05,238 --> 00:15:08,324
- Damn skippy.
- But when the smoke clears...

231
00:15:08,408 --> 00:15:10,785
it's niggas like me that let
you hold on to what you got.

232
00:15:10,868 --> 00:15:12,828
You know I despise that word.

233
00:15:12,912 --> 00:15:14,289
I know.

234
00:15:15,373 --> 00:15:17,542
It's easy to underestimate a nigga.

235
00:15:18,501 --> 00:15:20,795
They never see you coming.

236

- What's that?
- It's a cosmo.

237
00:15:35,225 --> 00:15:38,688
[chuckles] Your jacket's a little small.

238
00:15:40,523 --> 00:15:41,691
So is your dress.

239
00:15:44,402 --> 00:15:45,903
Touché.

240
00:15:50,866 --> 00:15:53,744
- Cornell, my man.
- Champagne.

241
00:15:53,801 --> 00:15:55,723
- [Stokes] All right.
- Councilwoman.

242
00:15:55,746 --> 00:15:58,749
- What are you two celebrating?
- Success.

243
00:15:59,667 --> 00:16:02,503
Partnership that should have
happened a long time ago, had...

244
00:16:02,587 --> 00:16:05,423
my uncle and your brother had their way.

245
00:16:05,506 --> 00:16:07,174
Uncle Pete was good people.

246
00:16:08,092 --> 00:16:09,594
Salvador really liked Pete.

247
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:12,305
Anytime.

248
00:16:19,937 --> 00:16:22,189
- [Luke] Lookin' for somethin'?
- No.

249
00:16:23,065 --> 00:16:26,736
Saadiq's still got it. [chuckles]

250
00:16:26,819 --> 00:16:28,237
Stone Rollin' was a dope album.

251
00:16:28,321 --> 00:16:31,574
[chuckling] "Album"? Now
I know you're an old head.

252

You ain't no spring
chicken neither, sucker.

Touché.

[chuckling]

255
00:16:43,878 --> 00:16:46,130
[man] All right. So let
me get this straight.

256
00:16:46,213 --> 00:16:48,257
I give your cousin a contribution

257
00:16:48,341 --> 00:16:50,718
and it's like a get out of
jail free card for me, right?

258
00:16:50,801 --> 00:16:52,302
That's something to celebrate.

259
00:16:52,387 --> 00:16:54,764
No, I don't do that.

260
00:16:54,847 --> 00:16:56,349
[chuckles]

261
00:16:56,432 --> 00:16:58,183
[inhales] See, me...

262
00:16:58,267 --> 00:17:01,937
I celebrate when things are
finished. Not when it's just starting.

263
00:17:02,021 --> 00:17:04,023
[woman] Listen to him.

264
00:17:04,106 --> 00:17:06,942
This is nothing to celebrate.

265
00:17:07,026 --> 00:17:08,778
You saw what happened to Fisk.

266
00:17:08,861 --> 00:17:11,572
You two shouldn't even
be seen together...

267
00:17:11,656 --> 00:17:13,866
let alone having me all
up in the Kool-Aid.

268
00:17:14,617 --> 00:17:18,454
But you're here anyway. Something
must be right about it.

269
00:17:18,538 --> 00:17:21,666
Otherwise, you wouldn't have
fronted me if you didn't agree.

270
00:17:21,749 --> 00:17:24,419
I have no illusions about
our family's legacy.

271
00:17:24,502 --> 00:17:29,757
But you are now turning legitimate
money illegal all over again.

272
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:33,719
[chuckles] What's illegal about it?

273
00:17:33,803 --> 00:17:36,806
Our product is protected
by the Constitution.

274
00:17:36,889 --> 00:17:39,934
But you came to me because
you trust me, Domingo.

[R&B music playing]

In your business, people need my

- Nah.

<i>You can brighten someone's
day permanently with this shit.</i>

<i>No serial numbers... because
my connect is nice like that.</i>

[Domingo] <i>Who's your connect?</i>

- That's it.

- Easy-peasy.
- Nothing's ever that easy.

So what happens after
they call to confirm?

do? They're gonna know it was me.

B, there's, like, a

Yo, this shit works, Chico.

317
00:20:54,461 --> 00:20:56,505
Dante would have snitched.

318
00:20:56,589 --> 00:20:58,758
You see... you see how shook he was?

319
00:20:58,841 --> 00:21:00,300
Come on, man. I ain't...

320
00:21:00,384 --> 00:21:03,303
Ain't no way I'm splitting that
shit three ways no how, man.

321
00:21:03,387 --> 00:21:06,098
Dante was crew, B. That's Dante!

322
00:21:06,181 --> 00:21:09,143
Yo, I made a
decision. I'm gonna be rich.

323
00:21:09,226 --> 00:21:11,771
- [Chico breathing heavily]
- Let's go.

324
00:21:20,195 --> 00:21:22,698
[Shameek] Let's go! Come on!

325
00:21:25,242 --> 00:21:27,244
[R&B music playing]

326
00:21:43,844 --> 00:21:47,389
So you're a bench-warmer?
Or did you miss the cut?

327
00:21:47,472 --> 00:21:48,557
Excuse me?

328
00:21:49,183 --> 00:21:51,560
I just figured you were... one of his.

329
00:21:52,895 --> 00:21:54,396
One of Cottonmouth's?

330
00:21:54,479 --> 00:21:56,523
[chuckles] I hear he hates that name.

331
00:21:57,107 --> 00:21:59,568
- Mr. Stokes'...
- Cottonmouth's...

332
00:22:00,610 --> 00:22:01,821
Models.

333
00:22:02,947 --> 00:22:04,699
What makes you assume that?

334
00:22:05,658 --> 00:22:08,160
You're beautiful. But...

335
00:22:08,243 --> 00:22:09,829
But what?

336
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:14,667
You're a little older than
he usually likes them.

337
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:16,669
[chuckles]

338
00:22:16,752 --> 00:22:19,922
Yeah, you're definitely not
getting a tip tonight.

339
00:22:21,048 --> 00:22:22,257
But I'm not finished.

340
00:22:22,341 --> 00:22:23,968
Mmm.

341
00:22:25,510 --> 00:22:27,637
Dumb men like little girls.

342
00:22:27,722 --> 00:22:29,639
Me?

343
00:22:29,724 --> 00:22:31,641
I ponder a woman.

344
00:22:34,603 --> 00:22:36,021
Why don't you...

345
00:22:39,149 --> 00:22:41,736
ponder me another cosmo?

346
00:22:43,070 --> 00:22:44,864
[both chuckle]

347
00:22:46,073 --> 00:22:47,157
[Candace] Luke.

348
00:22:48,325 --> 00:22:49,451
Hey, Candace.

349
00:22:50,494 --> 00:22:51,787
You got promoted?

350
00:22:51,871 --> 00:22:54,248
Dante's out sick.

351
00:22:55,624 --> 00:22:56,792
You okay?

352
00:22:57,667 --> 00:23:00,504
Table seven wants six
bottles of Ace of Spades.

353
00:23:00,587 --> 00:23:02,047
I need you to help me carry them up.

354
00:23:07,302 --> 00:23:09,889
I don't like being up there by myself.

355
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:13,392
I'm right behind you. Give me a second.

356
00:23:26,906 --> 00:23:31,160
Why don't you... ponder
that 'til I get back.

357
00:23:52,807 --> 00:23:54,724
You're a big one, eh?

358
00:23:54,809 --> 00:23:56,726
He's wearing a little jacket.

359
00:23:56,811 --> 00:23:58,813
[Stokes laughs]

360
00:24:00,189 --> 00:24:02,732
Haven't seen you behind the bar.

361
00:24:02,817 --> 00:24:04,484
Where's Dante?

362
00:24:05,861 --> 00:24:07,446
Called in sick, I guess.

363
00:24:08,738 --> 00:24:10,199
You want a job?

364
00:24:12,701 --> 00:24:15,579
I can find something more
suitable for a man your size.

365
00:24:16,496 --> 00:24:17,957
Better paying, too.

366
00:24:19,083 --> 00:24:21,293
You ever carried a gun?

367
00:24:22,086 --> 00:24:23,337
No.

368
00:24:24,588 --> 00:24:26,882
I'm good. Thanks.

369

00:24:50,197 --> 00:24:51,615
Yeah?

372
00:24:56,078 --> 00:24:57,997
Shit. Fuck.

[typing]

375
00:25:24,705 --> 00:25:26,501
You got to walk over
to Adam Clayton Powell

376
00:25:26,525 --> 00:25:28,068
if you wanna catch the bus.

377
00:25:32,531 --> 00:25:33,615
Uber?

378
00:25:34,699 --> 00:25:37,411
- That's what you were gonna press, right?
- What are you?

379
00:25:37,494 --> 00:25:40,414
- A cop?
- [chuckles] No.

380
00:25:41,706 --> 00:25:43,542
You just look cold.

381
00:25:49,589 --> 00:25:52,717
If you're looking for
Mr. Stokes, he just left.

382
00:25:54,136 --> 00:25:55,345
Who?

383
00:25:56,263 --> 00:25:57,639
Black Escalade.

Tinted windows.

385
00:26:02,894 --> 00:26:06,481
Don't you have... somewhere
you need to be?

386
00:26:08,858 --> 00:26:10,152
Yeah.

387

Just got off.

Congratulations.

390
00:26:23,415 --> 00:26:25,167
You wanna go grab a coffee?

391
00:26:34,343 --> 00:26:35,719
I don't like coffee.

392
00:26:36,345 --> 00:26:38,013
Neither do I.

I'm an auditor.

What's that?

417
00:29:11,083 --> 00:29:14,002
Basically, I look at
the financial books.

418
00:29:14,086 --> 00:29:16,380
Make sure everything's on the up and up.

00:29:17,339 --> 00:29:19,924
And you need a short dress for that?

420
00:29:24,429 --> 00:29:26,890
Sometimes you got to blend in.

421
00:29:26,973 --> 00:29:28,475
Impossible.

- Who can keep track?

Who do you think this
guy was trying to call?

00:31:04,946 --> 00:31:06,948
- Ghostbusters.

Hey, Bailey. How you doing?

It's another beautiful day at
the office. What's not to love?

00:31:15,290 --> 00:31:17,876
Don't you start
singing show tunes on me.

435
00:31:20,379 --> 00:31:22,631
Oh, shit.

436
00:31:23,548 --> 00:31:25,049
Dante Chapman.

437
00:31:25,133 --> 00:31:26,426
You know him?

438
00:31:27,761 --> 00:31:29,679
I know his mama.

439
00:31:33,267 --> 00:31:35,894
[Stokes] Of course it
wasn't a inside job.

440
00:31:36,811 --> 00:31:38,438
We had people die, too.

441
00:31:39,481 --> 00:31:42,484
Look... I don't have the stuff.

442
00:31:43,777 --> 00:31:46,905
Hmm. We need to talk
about this in person.

443
00:31:46,988 --> 00:31:48,948
My word is still my bond.

444
00:31:51,326 --> 00:31:52,827
Hello?

445
00:31:55,955 --> 00:31:57,291
That's Domingo?

Yo, what's up?

It's above your pay grade.

What?

450
00:32:07,759 --> 00:32:09,761
[man] Tell your man what's
going on, Cornell.

[clears throat]
So... what can I do for you?

459
00:32:34,786 --> 00:32:36,913
It's the other way around.

460
00:32:38,122 --> 00:32:39,666
Y'all got hit last night.

461

Diamondback gave you

is in a police evidence lockup.

464
00:32:48,132 --> 00:32:52,721
And the money... that Domingo and
his crew were supposed to give you...

465
00:32:52,804 --> 00:32:54,180
is gone.

466
00:32:55,599 --> 00:32:58,435
I'm with Diamondback now.
You knew that, right?

467
00:32:59,102 --> 00:33:00,743
Well, tell
Diamondback, it's about time...

468
00:33:00,812 --> 00:33:03,482
Uh-uh... Diamondback tells you.

469
00:33:05,024 --> 00:33:07,151
[laughs]

470
00:33:07,235 --> 00:33:08,945
I'm his number one seller.

471
00:33:09,028 --> 00:33:10,655
I ain't here to spank you.

472
00:33:12,491 --> 00:33:14,951
But I do need to look
you in your eyes...

473
00:33:18,330 --> 00:33:19,664
Was it an inside job?

474
00:33:20,832 --> 00:33:22,166
No.

475
00:33:22,250 --> 00:33:24,002
Hell no.

476
00:33:24,085 --> 00:33:25,629
I needed that money, too.

477
00:33:25,712 --> 00:33:27,171
[sighs]

478
00:33:28,006 --> 00:33:30,299
It took forever to build
up that kind of trust.

479
00:33:30,384 --> 00:33:32,552
We're here to get you back on your feet.

480
00:33:32,636 --> 00:33:33,678
Whatever you need.

00:33:45,565 --> 00:33:47,108
Just like back in the day.

485
00:33:47,191 --> 00:33:49,277
Forget about back in the day.

486
00:33:51,070 --> 00:33:52,739
Why is this feeling like a takeover?

487
00:33:52,822 --> 00:33:54,240
[chuckling softly] It's not.

488
00:33:55,324 --> 00:33:57,285
If it was...

489
00:33:57,369 --> 00:33:59,913
you would never even
see Diamondback comin'.

490
00:33:59,996 --> 00:34:01,665
He wants you to win.

491
00:34:03,458 --> 00:34:05,001
How can I help?

492
00:34:14,343 --> 00:34:16,513
[indistinct chatter]

493
00:34:26,230 --> 00:34:30,444
[Pop] <i>Dante was one of
my kids. So was Chico.</i>

494
00:34:30,527 --> 00:34:32,404
And Shameek, too.

495
00:34:32,487 --> 00:34:35,073
Just like those kids playing over there.

496
00:34:35,156 --> 00:34:39,077
[scoffs] You know, that's
how you get 'em on your side.

497
00:34:39,160 --> 00:34:42,080
Sweepin' up hair. Runnin'
errands. [chuckling]

498
00:34:42,163 --> 00:34:47,001
Lettin' 'em hang out, play video games.

499
00:34:47,085 --> 00:34:50,797
Anything is better than what's waiting
for them out there on the street.

500
00:34:53,925 --> 00:34:55,427
They want a way out...

501
00:34:56,636 --> 00:35:01,558
but they have too much
pride to ask for help.

502
00:35:01,641 --> 00:35:05,562
So you gotta Jedi mind-trick
them into something. [chuckles]

503
00:35:05,645 --> 00:35:08,940
Everyone has a gun.
[sighs] No one has a father.

504
00:35:09,023 --> 00:35:11,150
Ain't that the truth.

505
00:35:11,234 --> 00:35:12,652
You sure they did it?

506
00:35:12,736 --> 00:35:16,740
People started callin' me half
an hour after it happened.

507
00:35:16,823 --> 00:35:20,702
Shameek has always been the spark plug.

508
00:35:21,953 --> 00:35:24,372
And Chico... a follower.

509
00:35:25,790 --> 00:35:29,544
I just can't believe that
either one of them...

510
00:35:29,628 --> 00:35:32,005
would just turn around...

511
00:35:33,339 --> 00:35:37,218
and kill... Dante.

512
00:35:39,763 --> 00:35:43,558
You didn't see anything going
on with either one of 'em, did you?

513
00:35:47,771 --> 00:35:49,063
No.

514
00:35:54,819 --> 00:35:57,446
You live and die by your choices.

515
00:35:57,531 --> 00:36:00,408
This is Harlem's garden. That's
what's happening here.

516
00:36:00,492 --> 00:36:03,703
You are the ones that are
gonna keep this community...

517
00:36:03,787 --> 00:36:05,622
[chuckles and gasps]

518
00:36:05,705 --> 00:36:08,625
Where have... Oh, God.
This is Marisol. Baby...

519
00:36:08,708 --> 00:36:11,503
Oh, my God, known her
since she was first born.

520
00:36:11,586 --> 00:36:14,422
And here you are
upturnin' Harlem around.

521
00:36:14,506 --> 00:36:15,924
I'm so proud of you.

522
00:36:16,007 --> 00:36:19,010
Ah! I saw you running
for the bus this mornin'.

523
00:36:20,011 --> 00:36:21,846
All right, darling.

524
00:36:24,974 --> 00:36:26,601
I'm happy you made it, darling.

525
00:36:26,685 --> 00:36:28,937
Uh-uh, uh-uh, cut him off at three.

526
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:31,565
I know this young brother.
He'll eat five hamburgers.

527
00:36:31,648 --> 00:36:33,482
I've seen you do it.

528
00:36:38,697 --> 00:36:43,743
Now, Harlem is a community that
welcomes everyone. All people.

529
00:36:43,827 --> 00:36:46,162
But at the same time,

530
00:36:46,245 --> 00:36:48,665
since the days of Langston Hughes,

531
00:36:48,748 --> 00:36:53,127
Malcolm X, Zora Neale
Hurston, Duke Ellington,

532
00:36:53,211 --> 00:36:56,673
Harlem has been the
jewel of black America.

533
00:36:56,756 --> 00:37:02,554
It's a perpetual symbol of... of
hope and prosperity and excellence.

534
00:37:02,637 --> 00:37:04,222
For black lives to matter,

535
00:37:04,305 --> 00:37:07,642
black history and black
ownership must also matter.

536
00:37:07,726 --> 00:37:12,480
Now, my multifaceted plan for
the Crispus Attucks Complex

537
00:37:12,564 --> 00:37:15,775
is just yet another way to
bring hope to a new generation,

538
00:37:15,859 --> 00:37:19,613
to incubate the kind of
innovation and creativity

539
00:37:19,696 --> 00:37:22,448
and progress that Harlem's famous for.

540
00:37:23,617 --> 00:37:26,285
Thank you again for your
time, Madam Councilwoman.

541
00:37:26,369 --> 00:37:28,246
Oh, Megan, you're
always welcome in Harlem.

542
00:37:28,329 --> 00:37:29,664
- All right.
- All right, darling.

543
00:37:32,333 --> 00:37:34,711
Y'all need to fall the hell back.

544
00:37:34,794 --> 00:37:37,005
Zip, give her some space.

545
00:37:37,088 --> 00:37:38,965
I don't like the thugs.

546
00:37:39,048 --> 00:37:41,467
- You need them for security.
- Mmm, they scare people.

547
00:37:41,550 --> 00:37:44,721
They pass out flyers, get
contributions, tributes.

548
00:37:44,804 --> 00:37:47,390
[in Jamaican accent] Just
like in Jamaica, you know?

549
00:37:47,473 --> 00:37:51,102
- Yeah, well, we ain't Jamaican, Cornell.
- [chuckling]

550
00:37:51,185 --> 00:37:54,856
You shouldn't be here. We don't
need to be photographed together.

551
00:37:55,607 --> 00:37:56,900
Why?

552
00:37:57,525 --> 00:37:58,610
You ashamed of me?

553
00:38:01,029 --> 00:38:02,739
That hurts, Mariah.

554
00:38:02,822 --> 00:38:04,323
- Tony.
- Hmm?

555
00:38:04,407 --> 00:38:05,992
Will you give us a moment?

556
00:38:13,750 --> 00:38:15,794
I need the money you promised me ASAP.

557
00:38:15,877 --> 00:38:17,629
Now you want the money?

558
00:38:18,922 --> 00:38:22,050
I used federal grant and
tax-deductible donation money

559
00:38:22,133 --> 00:38:24,385
to complete construction on your club

560
00:38:24,468 --> 00:38:28,222
and to facilitate that meticulous
deal that just fell apart.

561
00:38:28,807 --> 00:38:31,976
I don't get the money,
I'm facing an audit.

562
00:38:32,060 --> 00:38:33,436
We all go to jail.

563
00:38:33,978 --> 00:38:35,647
It'll be there.

564
00:38:38,107 --> 00:38:41,152
What happened at the
junkyard last night?

565
00:38:41,235 --> 00:38:43,947
And who's the dude in
the sunglasses behind you?

566
00:38:44,989 --> 00:38:46,574
Is he after the money, too?

567
00:38:47,575 --> 00:38:50,161
Either you want the
details, cuz, or you don't.

568
00:38:54,708 --> 00:38:56,668
That's what I thought.

569
00:38:59,671 --> 00:39:00,714
What's the word?

570
00:39:00,797 --> 00:39:04,676
Confirmation of what Dante
told us while he was dying.

571
00:39:04,759 --> 00:39:07,053
His friends, the one that
play on your summer league team

572

at the Rucker, jacked your shit.

573

00:39:15,979 --> 00:39:16,980
No.

576
00:39:19,148 --> 00:39:20,566
Double down.

577

twerking for him right now.

He ain't going nowhere soon. Not
with all that ass in his face.

581
00:39:58,687 --> 00:40:01,733
You want me to keep him
here, you need to pay me.

Hey, yo, my man. You
know what time it is?

Stay Harlem.

Stay black.

- Hey, man.
- Watch your hands.

590
00:41:35,201 --> 00:41:36,202
You need to pay me.

591
00:41:36,285 --> 00:41:37,346
I'm paying you under the table,

592
00:41:37,370 --> 00:41:40,123
which means I'll pay you whenever
I goddamn feel like it.

593
00:41:44,878 --> 00:41:46,963
What you worried about?

594
00:41:47,659 --> 00:41:49,086
[Shameek] I'm not worried.

595
00:41:49,087 --> 00:41:50,775
I just never met Cottonmouth
before, that's all.

596

[Tone] Mr. Stokes.

00:41:52,927 --> 00:41:56,764
Mr. Stokes. That's
important. Never Cottonmouth.

645
00:45:42,906 --> 00:45:44,575
[breathing heavily]

646
00:45:45,493 --> 00:45:47,203
And go fetch my money.

647
00:45:54,335 --> 00:45:56,129
[breathing heavily]

648
00:46:03,219 --> 00:46:04,512
He didn't recognize you.

649
00:46:04,595 --> 00:46:05,888
[breathing heavily]

650
00:46:27,493 --> 00:46:29,578
[chain rattling faintly]

651
00:46:30,788 --> 00:46:32,581
[cell door buzzing faintly]

652
00:46:33,874 --> 00:46:39,004
Loneliness never goes away,
especially in places like Seagate.

653
00:46:39,087 --> 00:46:42,675
If you don't make
attempts to befriend someone...

654
00:46:43,884 --> 00:46:47,680
loneliness is guaranteed
to... eat you alive.

655

656
00:47:01,319 --> 00:47:02,861
[sighs]

657
00:47:11,036 --> 00:47:12,496
[exhales]

658
00:47:18,961 --> 00:47:20,629
I'm clear. [sighs]

659
00:47:22,172 --> 00:47:23,716
I'm focused.

660
00:47:25,468 --> 00:47:27,220
I promise, baby...

661
00:47:28,512 --> 00:47:29,722
I'm ready.

662
00:47:37,271 --> 00:47:38,772
[siren wails]

663
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:44,111
- [female detective sighing]
- Shameek Smith...

664
00:47:44,194 --> 00:47:47,990
based on what they found in his pockets.
We'll need dental to confirm ID.

665
00:47:48,073 --> 00:47:50,075
[chuckles] His face is jacked.

666
00:47:50,158 --> 00:47:54,372
Mmm. They definitely dumped him
here. They got him somewhere else.

667
00:47:54,455 --> 00:47:57,333
Mmm. Looks like he got hit by a truck.

668
00:47:57,416 --> 00:47:58,667
Yeah.

669
00:47:59,543 --> 00:48:02,338
- A truck with two fists.
- [Scarfe chuckles]

670
00:48:02,421 --> 00:48:04,340
You know, Benjamin Franklin said,

671
00:48:04,423 --> 00:48:08,927
"The only way that three people can
keep a secret is if two of 'em are dead."

672
00:48:09,011 --> 00:48:12,806
First Dante, now Shameek. Chico's
the last man standing.

673
00:48:12,890 --> 00:48:14,475
Benjamin Franklin...

674
00:48:14,558 --> 00:48:17,645
Didn't he electrocute
himself flying a kite in a rainstorm?

675
00:48:17,728 --> 00:48:19,409
I wouldn't base any
theories on that fool.

676
00:48:19,438 --> 00:48:22,400
Benjamin Franklin is on
the $100 bill, Scarfe.

677
00:48:22,483 --> 00:48:25,068
[scoffs] So? He wasn't a president.

678
00:48:25,152 --> 00:48:28,822
That's even more impressive. Come
on, give the man some credit.

679
00:48:29,990 --> 00:48:33,201
Well... So you think
Chico did this to Shameek?

680
00:48:34,578 --> 00:48:38,541
Chico is what? A buck 50 soaking wet?

681
00:48:38,624 --> 00:48:41,043
But we won't know for
sure until we find him.

682
00:48:41,126 --> 00:48:44,588
You said Dante wasn't bartendin'
the night you were at the club.

683
00:48:44,672 --> 00:48:45,798
No.

684
00:48:45,881 --> 00:48:47,942
Well, did you talk to the
guy that replaced him that night?

685
00:48:47,966 --> 00:48:50,511
[scoffs] I barely talked to the guy.

686
00:48:50,594 --> 00:48:53,013
I mean... [inhales] all
I did was order drinks.

687
00:48:53,096 --> 00:48:56,183
Well, maybe there's some
pattern, somethin' we're missin'.

688
00:48:56,266 --> 00:48:58,226
We need to go talk to that guy.

689
00:48:58,311 --> 00:49:00,813
That sounds like a
complete waste of time.

690
00:49:01,939 --> 00:49:03,566
That's entirely possible.

691
00:49:03,649 --> 00:49:06,234
But it's worth a shot.

692
00:49:06,319 --> 00:49:08,278
[scoffs] All right.

693
00:49:43,356 --> 00:49:45,899
You've been in this
country for how long?

694
00:49:45,983 --> 00:49:50,404
And you still... can't speak English?

695
00:49:50,488 --> 00:49:52,990
My English is just fine.

696
00:49:53,073 --> 00:49:54,950
Show Mariah Dillard some love.

697
00:49:55,033 --> 00:49:58,120
Contribute and we'll go away.

698
00:49:58,203 --> 00:49:59,329
It's a family thing.

699
00:49:59,413 --> 00:50:01,457
I own this restaurant.

700
00:50:01,540 --> 00:50:03,959
My father owned this building.

701
00:50:04,042 --> 00:50:08,296
Tell Mariah Dillard I am
not contributing to her complex.

702
00:50:08,381 --> 00:50:11,592
We voted for her and
gave her money before.

703
00:50:11,675 --> 00:50:14,387
And I respect Mr. Stokes.

704
00:50:14,470 --> 00:50:17,222
But no. No more.

705
00:50:17,305 --> 00:50:18,641
- I can't.
- [bat strikes]

706
00:50:19,975 --> 00:50:23,812
Give us... the money.

707
00:50:23,896 --> 00:50:27,274
Yo... I don't like your tone.

708
00:50:27,357 --> 00:50:28,859
Excuse me?

709
00:50:28,942 --> 00:50:31,737
You're being
disrespectful. It's unnecessary.

710
00:50:31,820 --> 00:50:33,864
[men laughing]

711
00:50:34,907 --> 00:50:37,200
[Koko] You need to step off, Mayweather.

712
00:50:37,284 --> 00:50:39,912
I mean, what you think
you gonna do, man?

713
00:50:39,995 --> 00:50:41,079
[Zip laughing]

714
00:50:41,163 --> 00:50:44,082
I think he think he gonna bring it.

715
00:50:44,166 --> 00:50:46,168
- [chuckles]
- [Luke] I can.

716
00:50:46,251 --> 00:50:49,171
Not the way I want to. I'd kill you.

717
00:50:49,254 --> 00:50:50,923
[mockingly] Ooh.

718
00:50:51,006 --> 00:50:52,382
[chuckles]

719
00:50:53,175 --> 00:50:55,886
I like this cat.
[clicks tongue] Yo, Amos.

720
00:50:55,969 --> 00:50:57,596
What up?

721
00:50:58,138 --> 00:51:00,390
Show the man what you famous for.

722
00:51:05,479 --> 00:51:06,647

You want some?

729
00:51:38,596 --> 00:51:40,639
I don't even like these niggas, man.

730
00:51:51,484 --> 00:51:52,943
I'm sorry about your window.

731
00:51:54,528 --> 00:51:56,113
[cash register opening]

732
00:51:57,615 --> 00:51:58,699
Here.

733
00:51:59,407 --> 00:52:01,577
- For what?
- For you.

734
00:52:01,660 --> 00:52:04,538
Ma'am, I'm the one who owes you money.

735
00:52:04,622 --> 00:52:08,125
You made things worse.
They'll come back again.

736
00:52:11,712 --> 00:52:13,088
We want to hire you.

737
00:52:20,554 --> 00:52:22,305
I'm not for hire.

738
00:52:23,599 --> 00:52:25,308
But you have my word, ma'am.

739
00:52:26,852 --> 00:52:28,353
I've got you.
