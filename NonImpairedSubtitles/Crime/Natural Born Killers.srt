2
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:51,600
-You'll be late.
-We're leaving, Mom.

3
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:55,000
As I leave....

4
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:57,960
What kind of pies do you have?

5
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:00,120
We got apple. . .

6
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:02,040
. . .pecan, cherry. . .

7
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:03,080
. . .key lime.

8
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:05,080
Which do you recommend?

9
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:07,640
The key lime's great, but. . .

10
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:09,560
. . .it's an acquired taste.

11
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:12,680
I ain't had key lime pie in 10 years.

12
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:14,720
When you had it, did you like it?

13
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:18,520
No, but I was a completely
different person back then.

14
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:21,480
Let's give that key lime pie
a day in court. . .

15
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:25,960
. . .and a big glass of nonfat milk,
if you please.

16
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:28,480
Should I make that two pieces?

17
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:30,560
No, no, Rosie.

18
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:34,800
My name's not Rosie, it's Mabel.

19
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:38,240
Whatever.

20
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:36,800
Goddamn, this son of a bitch
is running hot.

21
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:38,680
Go on in. I'll check it out.

22
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:42,720
All right.
I'll get a cold one for you.

23
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:49,640
What the hell is that?

24
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:56,480
That is a bitch out of hell, son.

25
00:02:56,720 --> 00:03:00,240
Take a run at her, kiddo.

26
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:05,680
-Miller, Mabel.
-Coming up.

27
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:15,800
That's one sweet piece of meat.

28
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:18,840
Her name's. . .

29
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:20,000
. . .Mallory.

30
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:25,640
Mallory, whatever. Who gives a shit?
I call it pussy.

31
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:45,800
Don't stop, darling.
I'm just getting started!

32
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:49,920
I think she's sweet on you!

33
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:54,480
Are you flirting with me?

34
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:57,520
Beep, beep.

35
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:04,640
You want a piece of the guy?
Do you?

36
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:09,400
Your move! Your move, fucker! Go!

37
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,440
This stinking. . . .

38
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:22,960
You son of a bi--

39
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:26,440
It's not polite to point.

40
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:32,960
Because she's mopping the floor
with your buddy. . .

41
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:37,040
. . .is no reason for you to join in.

42
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:49,800
How sexy am I now? Huh?

43
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:50,920
Flirty boy!

44
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:55,240
How sexy am I now?

45
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:08,840
You made my shit list!

46
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:12,600
Honey! Come on, he's dead.

47
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:20,120
There is no escaping here!

48
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:22,520
Who's the lucky one?

49
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:24,920
Eenie-meenie-minie-moe

50
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:27,560
Catch a redneck by his toe

51
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:30,840
If he hollers let him go

52
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:33,800
Eenie-meenie-minie-moe

53
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:36,680
My mama told me

54
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:39,880
To pick the best one

55
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:41,800
And you are...

56
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:44,560
...it!

57
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:58,320
When they ask you, you tell them
Mickey and Mallory Knox did it.

58
00:05:58,560 --> 00:05:59,360
Say it!

59
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:02,160
Mickey and Mallory Knox did it.

60
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:06,000
Mickey and Mallory Knox.

61
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:07,120
I love you, Mickey.

62
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:10,720
I love you, Mallory!

63
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:46,320
Stars are coming out.

64
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:50,600
Look up in the brassy sky and there
they are, like loony pocket change.

65
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:54,080
You bet on something you wish
you had $ 10,000 to bet on.

66
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:56,560
Something where the odds are good.

67
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:01,000
Betting all those stars
don 't mean shit....

68
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:28,240
Whole world's coming to an end, Mal.

69
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:33,440
That's the angels, Mickey.

70
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:37,160
They're coming down for us
from heaven.

71
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:40,640
And I see you riding a big red horse.

72
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:43,640
And you're driving the horses,
whipping them. . .

73
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:47,600
. . .and they're spitting and frothing
at the mouth.

74
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:51,520
They're coming right at us.

75
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:53,960
And I see the future.

76
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:55,840
There's no death.

77
00:08:56,080 --> 00:09:00,120
Because you and I, we're angels.

78
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:08,440
That is poetry.

79
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:13,680
I love you, Mal.

80
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:16,120
I know you do, baby.

81
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:20,720
I've loved you since the day we met.

82
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:28,960
Hi, Dad, how was work?

83
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:31,240
What work? I'm unemployed.

84
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:33,600
Where the fuck have you been?

85
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:35,680
You look nice, Mallory.

86
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:39,000
Yuck! You look like. . . .

87
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:40,880
Thanks, Mom.

88
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:44,920
I'm going now. I'll be back
at midnight, okay?

89
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:47,600
Are you wearing
a broomstick and a trash bag?

90
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:49,720
Why don't you put some meat on you?

91
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:52,680
Any lighter, you'll be Miss Ethiopia.

92
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:54,680
Where do you think you're going?

93
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:59,440
I'm going to the John Lee Hooker concert
with Donna. I told you yesterday.

94
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:02,800
First off, you don't tell me.
You ask my permission.

95
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:05,080
Second, you're not going out
in that dress!

96
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:07,880
You'll end up peddling your ass,
you stupid bitch.

97
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:10,880
You're not going out at all.
You didn't mow the yard.

98
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:13,360
That piece-of-shit
lawn mower is fucked!

99
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:17,000
That's the way you talk in front of
your mother? You stupid bitch!

100
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:18,800
You watch your language!

101
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:22,600
Or I'll kick the shit out of you,
like I do her!

102
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:25,080
If your ass is in this house. . .

103
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:26,920
. . .it's my ass.

104
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:30,000
So move it upstairs and take a shower.

105
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:32,520
Make sure it's a good shower.

106
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:38,520
Because I'm coming up after
to see how clean you are.

107
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:48,800
Weren't you a little hard on her, Ed?

108
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:53,520
I'll show her a little tenderness
after I eat.

109
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:57,440
When I get up there,
she won't see my face for an hour.

110
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:00,840
I think you should speak nicely
in front of Kevin.

111
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:04,200
Don't think. You're a fucking idiot.

112
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:05,880
What am I, a bad guy?

113
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:08,240
Did I ever ask you to fuck my friends?

114
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:09,880
And don't tell me what to do!

115
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:14,440
If it wasn't for me, you'd still be
slinging hash and fucking your boss!

116
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:16,240
That must be Donna.

117
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:18,080
I'll tell her the bad news.

118
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:22,120
Don't let your macaroni get cold, Ed.

119
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:31,920
Yes?

120
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:34,400
Delivery for Ed Wilson.

121
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:36,160
What on earth is it?

122
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:39,320
It's beef, lady. Fifty pounds of beef.

123
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:44,640
Wait right here. I have to have
a word with my husband.

124
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:53,560
Who are you?

125
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:55,840
Mickey. Who are you?

126
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:58,040
I'm Mallory.

127
00:11:58,280 --> 00:12:02,440
You ought to change your name
to Beautiful.

128
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:06,560
You a big. . .

129
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:10,040
. . .meat-eater, Mallory?

130
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:12,400
I could be.

131
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:15,400
You always dress like that?
Or you just. . .

132
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:17,440
. . .waiting for me?

133
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:20,760
Why would I dress like this
for somebody I don't know?

134
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,600
Maybe something inside you
told you to.

135
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:24,800
You know?

136
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:26,240
Like fate.

137
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:28,560
Do you believe in fate, Mallory?

138
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:30,120
Maybe.

139
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:31,800
You don't look happy.

140
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:35,760
Wanna go for a ride? Talk about it?

141
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:42,400
Ed, you promised your doctor
no more meat.

142
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:44,720
I eat what I want. So what?

143
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:47,760
This fucking food here,
you pray after you eat it.

144
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:53,360
I don't want you to clog up your
arteries and keel over at the table.

145
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:55,440
Don't fucking cry, it turns me off!

146
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:59,440
I haven't cried in 1 5 years,
and you still haven't touched me!

147
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:00,800
How about him?

148
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:03,920
You were drunk and you thought
you were in Mallory's room!

149
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:05,080
That's why we have Kevin.

150
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:08,440
You mean Mallory's my mom?

151
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:11,680
I'm sending the meat back!
I don't care what you do to me!

152
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:14,080
-You know what I'll do to you.
-Ed, look!

153
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:15,560
What's it say?

154
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:19,800
"Out with the meat man.
Back before dawn. Love, Mallory. "

155
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:21,280
That stupid bitch!

156
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:22,800
Is that your car?

157
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:24,080
My car?

158
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:25,680
That meat man cocksucker!

159
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:32,200
I broke her in, and he grabbed her.
I'll fix his ass. Call the cops!

160
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:44,920
Everything I see, I see you, Mal.

161
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:50,120
I know, baby. I'm going crazy too.

162
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:53,080
Even ugliness looks beautiful
because of you.

163
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:58,000
Even though I'm in here,
I visit you every night.

164
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:03,320
Listen, Mickey.

165
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:06,400
My daddy, he's gonna move us away. . .

166
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:10,360
. . .so that you can't never find me,
and I'm scared.

167
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:14,480
He can't keep me away from you.

168
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:16,680
He said if you ever show up. . .

169
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:19,840
. . .he's gonna kill you.

170
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:22,520
Kill me?
When's this supposed to happen?

171
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:24,600
Can I help you?

172
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:27,440
He won't leave me alone.

173
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:29,760
He keeps fucking touching me. . .

174
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,640
. . .and I can't take it.

175
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:34,440
I have to go.

176
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:37,680
If he finds out I'm gone,
he's gonna beat me.

177
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:40,560
I just wanted to tell you
I love you and I miss you.

178
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:42,560
Don't forget about me.

179
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:46,560
-You won't forget me?
-I won't forget about you.

180
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:47,760
It's cool.

181
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,840
No matter where he takes you. . .

182
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:54,840
. . .Timbuktu, it don't matter,
because we're fate.

183
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:59,240
Nobody can stop fate. Nobody can.

184
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:02,240
One of these nights soon. . .

185
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:05,960
. . .I'll be coming for you.

186
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:09,760
I gotta go.

187
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:18,640
I love you.

188
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:50,280
Tornado!

189
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:56,680
You guys get on the goddamn bus! Now!

190
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:19,120
Stop or I'll shoot!

191
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:54,720
Break his arm.

192
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:58,560
There's no action.
Am I watching two fags?

193
00:16:58,800 --> 00:16:59,600
Kill him.

194
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:02,960
Kill the fucking lndian!

195
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:05,000
Where do you think you're going?

196
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:06,400
I'm going out!

197
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:09,400
You ain't going nowhere.

198
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,760
Hey, Jack. Mickey's back.

199
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:18,320
Just the prick I wanna see.

200
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:24,440
All right, fuckface.

201
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:28,120
I'll take your eye out
and show it to you.

202
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:39,680
You been fucking the wrong woman!

203
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:46,160
"You stupid bitch!
You stupid, fucking bitch!

204
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:47,760
You will shut up!

205
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,120
You will eat your food!

206
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:50,840
You will listen to me!

207
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:54,880
Are you clean?
Are you soapy and wet?

208
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:56,480
You stupid. . .

209
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:58,200
. . .bitch! "

210
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:01,760
He's dead! He's dead!

211
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:04,600
Now, where's the old bag?

212
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:05,960
He's dead!

213
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:09,080
He's dead!

214
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,280
Hi, Mom.

215
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:27,760
You never did nothing!

216
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:38,680
Wait!

217
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:42,640
You're free, Kevin.

218
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:49,280
Wherever we go. . .

219
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:51,240
. . .or whatever happens, Mickey. . .

220
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:53,600
. . .when I look up at the stars. . .

221
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:56,640
. . .I'll know you're looking up
at the same ones.

222
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:59,080
Same ones, baby.

223
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:03,160
You make every day feel
like kindergarten.

224
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:11,400
Let's get a whole bunch of stuff,
because I need a whole new wardrobe. . .

225
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:15,480
. . .because I'm a new woman now.

226
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:17,600
I'm a new woman!

227
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:21,120
She's a new woman!

228
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:44,360
Past is behind us now.

229
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:47,640
It's time to grow up.

230
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:52,040
We have the road to hell
in front of us.

231
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:54,000
Mal?

232
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:56,520
Yes?

233
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:59,640
Will you marry me?

234
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:02,080
Of course I'll marry you.

235
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:06,400
I've been waiting for you
to say that for so long.

236
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:08,720
Where we gonna get married?

237
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:12,880
Right here, Mal.
This is our church.

238
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:17,040
I got a perfect thing.

239
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:31,080
Give me your hand.

240
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:33,160
That's not what I had in mind.

241
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:36,200
Fuck you!

242
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:39,080
Put them together.

243
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:43,080
It's very romantic, baby.

244
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:48,440
We'll be living in all the oceans now.

245
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:01,320
God, before you and this river
and this mountain. . .

246
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:04,920
. . .and everything
we don't know about. . .

247
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:07,560
. . .Mickey, do you
take Mallory to be. . .

248
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:14,040
. . .your lawful wedded wife, to have and
hold and treat right until you die?

249
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:16,880
I do.

250
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:21,640
Oh, baby.

251
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:27,320
Do you take Mickey to be your--

252
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:33,680
Won't murder anybody
on our wedding day.

253
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:34,920
Fuck you!

254
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:36,880
God!

255
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:39,840
I do.

256
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:41,600
For all eternity. . .

257
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:43,720
. . .until you and I die. . .

258
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:46,560
. . .and die and die again.

259
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:49,880
Till death do us part.

260
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:52,840
Baby, by the power vested in me. . .

261
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:55,240
. . .as God of my world. . .

262
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:59,840
. . .I pronounce us husband and wife.

263
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:16,160
After that, there was just
no stopping Mickey and Mallory.

264
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:21,840
They tore up the countryside with
a vengeance right out of the Bible.

265
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:46,360
Tonight I'm standing on Highway 666. . .

266
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:48,760
. . .running through towns
like Cortez. . .

267
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:53,000
. . .Shiprock, Sheep Springs
and ending in Gallup, New Mexico.

268
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:56,320
To some, a beautiful stretch
of the American landscape. . .

269
00:22:56,560 --> 00:22:59,600
. . .but to Mickey and Mallory Knox,
who are still at large. . .

270
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:03,800
. . .it is literally a candy lane
of murder and mayhem.

271
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:06,400
Patrolman Gerald Nash...

272
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:11,320
... was the first of 12 peace officers
that Mickey and Mallory murdered...

273
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:14,880
...during their reign of terror.

274
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:18,480
Gerald and his partner, Dale Wrigley...

275
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:23,000
... were parked at this doughnut shop,
Alfie's Donuts, when....

276
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:27,360
This 1970 Dodge Challenger pulled up
across the street.

277
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:30,160
Gerald, only three weeks out
of the academy...

278
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:33,400
... walked out with a coffee...

279
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:36,840
. . .and my bear claw.

280
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:38,760
Driver asked him a question.

281
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,120
Where's Farmington?

282
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:43,440
Looked like he was giving
street directions.

283
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:45,280
Take it over to 66. . .

284
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:48,480
. . .and Farmington's up, 65 miles.
Quick ride.

285
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:49,720
You going there?

286
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:52,800
When he finished
and waved him thanks...

287
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:55,800
... then up come that shotgun.

288
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:07,280
You cop-killing cocksuckers!

289
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:16,760
In the ensuing chase...

290
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:20,200
...a tragic murder occurred.

291
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:24,720
American bronze medalist
marathon bicyclist....

292
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:33,000
I always wanted to take a shot at one.
They're not so easy to hit.

293
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:35,360
We raped and pillaged
the first show to do this.

294
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:37,880
We changed the order
so it's less obvious.

295
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:42,280
It needs a new intro. You can't
cannibalize yourself all the time.

296
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:43,880
Repetition works.

297
00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:47,000
-You'll wind up with shit.
-Repetition works.

298
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:50,840
You think that those nitwits
in zombie-land remember anything?

299
00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:54,680
It's junk food for the brains.
Filler. Fodder. Whatever.

300
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:56,840
Just build to the interview.

301
00:24:57,080 --> 00:25:01,280
Keep saying that word,
"Live interview with Wayne Gale! "

302
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:02,440
Anticipation.

303
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:04,080
That's what it's all about.

304
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:05,560
Mickey and Mallory?

305
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:06,600
Hot.

306
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:07,680
They're hot.

307
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:10,200
Totally hot.

308
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:16,080
I love Mickey and Mallory!
They're so cool. They're so great!

309
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:23,600
They're the best thing to happen
to mass murder since Manson.

310
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:25,000
But way cooler.

311
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:27,080
Take great figures from the States:

312
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:29,680
Elvis. Jack Kerouac.

313
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:31,080
James Dean.

314
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:34,360
They are super cool.

315
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:37,960
Jim Morrison, Jack Nicholson...

316
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:41,760
...add a bloody pail of nitrate
and you got Mickey and Mallory.

317
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,760
I don 't believe in mass murder...

318
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,560
. . .or that shit.

319
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:46,680
Don't get us wrong.

320
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:49,840
We respect human life and all.

321
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:54,320
But if I was a mass murderer,
I'd be Mickey and Mallory.

322
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:17,600
I haven't seen a cop for 10 minutes.

323
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:20,960
Is there such thing
as a copless town?

324
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:24,800
That'd be paradise, wouldn't it?
Shangri-la.

325
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:27,760
Want a hostage?

326
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:29,000
No.

327
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:30,400
What about her?

328
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:32,720
From here?

329
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:34,600
What about her?

330
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:38,320
Too heavy? Too fat?

331
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:41,640
What's the matter?

332
00:26:42,040 --> 00:26:45,840
Do you think I'm still sexy?

333
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:53,000
We might have to find us
a motel here soon.

334
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:54,600
When I see one that looks nice. . .

335
00:26:54,840 --> 00:26:58,160
. . .I'll put my honey-bunny bride
down on the bed.

336
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:01,240
Tie her up.

337
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:25,240
Wanna go out and get something to eat?

338
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:30,120
We'll stay in.
We got plenty of action here.

339
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:36,640
Know what I've been thinking about?

340
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:40,600
Course I know.

341
00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:44,400
You're thinking about rolling around
in that sunflower patch. . .

342
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:45,720
. . .outside of Tulsa.

343
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:47,400
How'd you know?

344
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:52,280
And you been thinking about
cutting your hair short.

345
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:57,280
And you been thinking about us
settling down on a boat. . .

346
00:27:57,520 --> 00:28:01,200
. . .in a big lake,
with a dog and a jukebox. . .

347
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:04,200
. . .and a 26" Sony Trinitron.

348
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:07,680
I love it when you can read my mind.

349
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:11,320
I bet I know what
you been thinking about.

350
00:28:11,560 --> 00:28:15,920
I been thinking about why
they making all these stupid movies.

351
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:22,560
Anybody out there in Hollywood
believe in kissing anymore?

352
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:27,120
Love you, baby.

353
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:30,800
I love your knee.

354
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:33,600
Love your thigh.

355
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:36,280
Love your stomach.

356
00:28:36,520 --> 00:28:39,920
Love your finger.

357
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:41,080
Where is it?

358
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:43,760
Goddamn it, Mickey!

359
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:48,120
I just took it off so I wouldn't
snag my hair when I washed it.

360
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:50,000
Okay, baby, look.

361
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:54,640
Even if that ring pulls out every hair
on your head, it stays on.

362
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:57,560
If it tears out my eyeballs,
it never comes off.

363
00:28:57,800 --> 00:29:02,640
Every great thing we do
starts with these.

364
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:07,040
Since you put it that way.

365
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:28,200
Why are you looking at her?

366
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:35,560
I'm going for a ride.

367
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:41,120
Baby, hold on. I thought maybe
we could just throw her into the mix.

368
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:42,960
Shut up! Shut up!

369
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:46,560
Quit being so fucking cute!

370
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:48,360
You can be cute by yourself.

371
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:51,200
Little Mickey,
you're so fucking pretty!

372
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:54,600
You go fuck her.

373
00:29:56,040 --> 00:29:59,320
Maybe I just will!

374
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:24,040
Fill her up.

375
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:29,560
-Can I look at that car?
-Go ahead.

376
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:56,440
That'll be 17 bucks, lady.

377
00:31:56,800 --> 00:31:58,360
That's a nice 'Vette.

378
00:31:58,600 --> 00:32:00,160
Wait a second.

379
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:03,320
Don't I know you?

380
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:07,040
I don't think so.

381
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:15,120
Do you want to touch me?

382
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:24,360
Tell me you want me.

383
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:27,440
I want you.

384
00:32:28,120 --> 00:32:30,480
Tell me I'm beautiful.

385
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:32,440
You are beautiful.

386
00:32:32,680 --> 00:32:33,840
Am I beautiful?

387
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:37,760
So beautiful, I can't stand it.

388
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:39,640
Am I sexy?

389
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:41,480
Yes.

390
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:44,240
You're sexy.

391
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:03,000
Go down.

392
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:16,080
Holy shit!

393
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:19,880
You're Mallory Knox, ain't you?

394
00:33:34,840 --> 00:33:38,120
It's the worst fucking head
I ever got in my life!

395
00:33:38,360 --> 00:33:42,320
Next time don't be so fucking eager.

396
00:33:46,680 --> 00:33:50,120
It's called Scagnetti on Scagnetti,
in your bookstore.

397
00:33:50,360 --> 00:33:52,840
-Go buy it.
-I will.

398
00:33:53,080 --> 00:33:55,600
An author too, huh?

399
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:57,680
My wife could never wear these.

400
00:33:57,920 --> 00:34:01,640
Now that is a perfect ass.

401
00:34:02,360 --> 00:34:03,960
It's nice.

402
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:06,480
There's her arm.

403
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:09,320
Her head.

404
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:14,920
Dry saliva drops.

405
00:34:15,160 --> 00:34:17,600
See?

406
00:34:24,720 --> 00:34:27,200
That's my type of girl. I like her.

407
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:29,720
Let's see what we got here, scooter.

408
00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:32,560
Give it up.

409
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:37,600
Mallory Knox. . .

410
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:41,320
. . .meet Jack Scagnetti.

411
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:48,320
Exactly where do you expect us
to be going?

412
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:50,480
Where are we supposed to be?

413
00:34:50,720 --> 00:34:54,240
What town is it that's out here?

414
00:34:56,080 --> 00:34:59,560
Fuck, it's the fucking cheese.

415
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,320
Quit looking in the rear view.
Sit back.

416
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:07,600
Put the lighter on the floor.
Put it on the floor, Mickey.

417
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:10,440
Bury the bag.

418
00:35:13,240 --> 00:35:16,160
Would you relax?

419
00:35:25,720 --> 00:35:27,920
Turn left. I think there's a town.

420
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:30,920
All I see is desert.

421
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:34,280
That's right, Cochise. . .

422
00:35:34,520 --> 00:35:37,520
. . .go eat some more fried bread.

423
00:35:42,080 --> 00:35:44,320
Give me some 'shrooms, Mal.

424
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:47,880
Mine ain't kicking in yet.

425
00:35:56,040 --> 00:35:57,320
Turn left?

426
00:35:57,560 --> 00:36:00,320
Turn left to what, you stupid bitch?

427
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:02,680
"You stupid bitch. "

428
00:36:02,920 --> 00:36:05,280
"You stupid bitch"?

429
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:06,920
"You stupid bitch" !

430
00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:10,280
Mickey, that's what
my father used to call me!

431
00:36:10,520 --> 00:36:12,960
Thought you'd be
more creative than that.

432
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:16,840
You're losing it, Mickey!
You're losing it!

433
00:36:17,080 --> 00:36:20,600
Snakes and birds.
Ain't nothing out here.

434
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:24,040
I'd go down on a lawman
for a gallon of gas.

435
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:27,320
Let me tell you something.
This is the 1 990s.

436
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:30,520
In this day and age,
a man has to have choices.

437
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:32,440
A man has to have variety.

438
00:36:32,680 --> 00:36:34,120
What do you mean, "variety"?

439
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:37,440
Hostages? You want to fuck
some other women now?

440
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:39,040
Is that what you mean?

441
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:40,320
Why'd you pick me up?

442
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:42,680
Why take me out of my house. . .

443
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:46,640
. . .and kill my parents with me?
Ain't you committed to me?

444
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:48,600
Where are we fucking going?

445
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:50,560
Relax. It's me, your lover. . .

446
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:53,360
. . .not some demon, not your father.

447
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:56,240
No, you're not my fucking lover!
You're not my--

448
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:59,520
You've been fucking loving me?

449
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:03,440
You been loving me real true!

450
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:32,560
Listen. . .

451
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:37,720
. . .we got tobacco, lots of tobacco.
You got any gas we can buy?

452
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:40,160
I don't think he speaks English.

453
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:45,640
Push comes to shove, we can snatch
that donkey and ride out of here.

454
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:48,840
Come in.

455
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:56,640
Come on in.

456
00:37:57,840 --> 00:38:01,200
Oh, my God!

457
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:03,000
Friendly snake?

458
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:06,320
It's a rattlesnake.

459
00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:11,320
My name is Mallory.

460
00:38:11,560 --> 00:38:14,520
This is Mickey.

461
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:16,520
How. . .

462
00:38:16,760 --> 00:38:19,280
. . .you doing?

463
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:30,040
We're not from here.

464
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:46,280
This is like The Twilight Zone.

465
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:50,400
Is that your wife?

466
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:17,920
He died?

467
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:20,600
He was your baby?

468
00:39:29,640 --> 00:39:31,920
Feel the demons here?

469
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:35,840
I think we're the demons.

470
00:41:41,160 --> 00:41:42,520
Who are you fucking?

471
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:45,320
-Your father.
-Bitch!

472
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:30,400
I said, shut up!

473
00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:31,760
Come here, pecker-head.

474
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,800
No, don't hit me!

475
00:42:40,600 --> 00:42:43,760
I hate you, you little asshole!

476
00:42:58,280 --> 00:43:01,520
This is so bad! What did you do?

477
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:05,440
I didn't mean it! I didn't mean it!

478
00:43:22,840 --> 00:43:26,640
Bad, bad, bad!

479
00:43:39,160 --> 00:43:41,600
Get it together now.

480
00:43:41,840 --> 00:43:44,160
It's okay.

481
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:45,680
We're out of here.

482
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:48,560
Come on!

483
00:43:58,240 --> 00:44:01,360
Come on, Mal!

484
00:44:02,200 --> 00:44:03,920
Let's go!

485
00:44:04,160 --> 00:44:06,720
Come on!

486
00:44:07,160 --> 00:44:08,120
Why? Why?

487
00:44:08,360 --> 00:44:11,960
What did you do that for?

488
00:44:12,200 --> 00:44:14,760
It was an accident.
This whole thing is crazy.

489
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:17,000
There are no accidents, Mickey!

490
00:44:17,240 --> 00:44:20,600
I'm human, and I made a mistake.
You gotta--

491
00:44:20,840 --> 00:44:21,800
You are sick!

492
00:44:22,040 --> 00:44:24,920
You killed life! He fed us!

493
00:44:25,160 --> 00:44:27,400
He took us in there!

494
00:44:27,640 --> 00:44:30,240
That is a harsh indictment.
Hold it!

495
00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:31,280
Hold it! Hold!

496
00:44:31,520 --> 00:44:33,120
Leave me alone! I'm going!

497
00:44:33,360 --> 00:44:35,920
No, hang on!

498
00:44:36,040 --> 00:44:39,800
I got bit! I got bit!

499
00:44:39,880 --> 00:44:42,560
Hold on, Mal!

500
00:44:44,120 --> 00:44:46,400
-Hold on there, Mal!
-I think there's more!

501
00:44:46,640 --> 00:44:50,040
-Hang on!
-Mickey, there's more!

502
00:44:50,280 --> 00:44:51,080
Oh, shit!

503
00:44:51,320 --> 00:44:54,040
They're out there!

504
00:44:54,360 --> 00:44:56,160
There's more!

505
00:44:56,400 --> 00:44:59,760
What have we done? Hop on.

506
00:45:10,160 --> 00:45:11,800
You know something?

507
00:45:12,040 --> 00:45:14,880
Badasses don't die.

508
00:45:15,520 --> 00:45:18,800
I'm seeing things!

509
00:45:26,440 --> 00:45:28,400
It's okay.

510
00:45:28,640 --> 00:45:29,760
Just dreaming.

511
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:33,600
It's just a dream, Mal.

512
00:45:38,560 --> 00:45:40,200
My name's Pinky.

513
00:45:40,440 --> 00:45:42,320
I remember now.

514
00:45:42,560 --> 00:45:45,480
My brother gave me this name
when I was about 6.

515
00:45:45,720 --> 00:45:49,960
He said, "You're as big as my pinky. "

516
00:45:51,200 --> 00:45:54,480
I don't like cheap motels.
They give me the creeps.

517
00:45:54,720 --> 00:45:57,080
Yeah, me too.

518
00:45:58,160 --> 00:45:59,680
You a real cop?

519
00:45:59,920 --> 00:46:01,760
Yeah, I'm a real cop.

520
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:03,320
You won't hurt me?

521
00:46:03,560 --> 00:46:06,760
I've never hurt anybody
in my whole life. I'm the law.

522
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:09,000
I'm your protector.

523
00:46:09,240 --> 00:46:11,600
Come on over here.
Come here.

524
00:46:11,840 --> 00:46:15,200
Come on over here.
Take off them shoes.

525
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:17,600
You're pretty.

526
00:46:17,840 --> 00:46:19,560
Step up on the bed.

527
00:46:19,800 --> 00:46:22,840
Real slow.

528
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:26,480
That's nice. Move around.

529
00:46:26,600 --> 00:46:29,840
Move around for me.

530
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:33,760
Yeah, like that.

531
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:35,120
Come on down here.

532
00:46:35,360 --> 00:46:36,400
Real slow.

533
00:46:36,640 --> 00:46:37,880
Give me a kiss.

534
00:46:38,120 --> 00:46:41,000
Give Big Jack a kiss.

535
00:46:41,240 --> 00:46:42,440
Like me?

536
00:46:42,680 --> 00:46:45,080
I like you. Come on, Pinky.

537
00:46:45,320 --> 00:46:48,080
Ever been strangled?

538
00:46:50,160 --> 00:46:53,200
Give me a kiss.

539
00:46:57,640 --> 00:47:00,840
You're pretty.

540
00:47:01,720 --> 00:47:05,280
I said, come on.

541
00:47:05,640 --> 00:47:08,000
This is a sick joke!

542
00:47:08,240 --> 00:47:11,640
I'm just kidding, all right?

543
00:47:22,560 --> 00:47:24,680
Bitch!

544
00:47:24,920 --> 00:47:27,080
Mickey!

545
00:47:27,320 --> 00:47:31,240
I'm coming to get you!

546
00:48:02,320 --> 00:48:03,880
I'm not gonna make it.

547
00:48:04,120 --> 00:48:05,480
I feel so cold.

548
00:48:05,720 --> 00:48:08,160
You're gonna make it. Get mad.

549
00:48:08,400 --> 00:48:11,800
Go get the stuff, then.

550
00:48:12,040 --> 00:48:15,040
All right.

551
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:23,080
Once they were average citizens living
drab, nothing-ever-happens lives.

552
00:48:23,320 --> 00:48:28,240
But then these sweethearts began
a cross-country murder spree...

553
00:48:28,480 --> 00:48:32,880
... which has lasted
only three terrifying weeks...

554
00:48:33,720 --> 00:48:36,960
...but has left 48 known bodies
in its wake...

555
00:48:37,200 --> 00:48:38,760
...including...

556
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:43,600
...Mallory's own mum and dad.

557
00:48:43,800 --> 00:48:46,120
Oh, shit.

558
00:48:46,360 --> 00:48:48,120
Excuse me.

559
00:48:48,360 --> 00:48:51,000
Aloha?

560
00:48:52,480 --> 00:48:54,760
Chief?

561
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:58,760
Rattlesnake took a chunk
out of us a ways back.

562
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:00,720
Me and my wife are pretty sick.

563
00:49:00,960 --> 00:49:05,160
Could be dying, you never can tell
about these things.

564
00:49:05,400 --> 00:49:08,600
How's about you ungluing your fat ass
from that boob tube. . .

565
00:49:08,840 --> 00:49:11,400
. . .and getting us some snake juice. . .

566
00:49:11,640 --> 00:49:14,440
. . .pronto.

567
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:18,320
--depraved and sick actions.

568
00:49:21,360 --> 00:49:23,640
Found it yet?

569
00:49:27,640 --> 00:49:29,520
They stormed in with shotguns...

570
00:49:29,760 --> 00:49:33,720
...and after liberating the place of
all the firearms they could carry...

571
00:49:33,960 --> 00:49:37,120
...and various personal
idiosyncratic knickknacks...

572
00:49:37,360 --> 00:49:39,360
... they killed every customer...

573
00:49:39,600 --> 00:49:42,400
... without hesitation.

574
00:49:42,800 --> 00:49:43,920
Money! Faster!

575
00:49:44,160 --> 00:49:47,720
But they always leave
one clerk alive...

576
00:49:47,960 --> 00:49:51,040
... to tell the tale of Mickey...

577
00:49:51,280 --> 00:49:53,600
...and Mallory.

578
00:49:54,120 --> 00:49:57,640
I'll be damned.

579
00:50:00,680 --> 00:50:02,960
You piece of shit!

580
00:50:07,760 --> 00:50:09,120
Mal! Cops!

581
00:50:09,360 --> 00:50:11,600
I'll meet you out front with the car!

582
00:50:11,840 --> 00:50:15,320
Get the car! I'll get the juice!

583
00:50:31,240 --> 00:50:34,080
No, please!

584
00:50:37,040 --> 00:50:38,280
That's sweet.

585
00:50:38,520 --> 00:50:42,240
-Snake juice?
-The back.

586
00:50:48,560 --> 00:50:51,480
We don't carry it! Hospital.

587
00:50:51,720 --> 00:50:55,120
This shit keep you hard?

588
00:50:55,160 --> 00:50:56,760
I'm the only clerk left.

589
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:58,320
I'm the only clerk left!

590
00:50:58,560 --> 00:51:02,640
-You're forgetting something.
-What's that?

591
00:51:03,120 --> 00:51:04,280
If I don't kill you. . .

592
00:51:04,520 --> 00:51:07,080
. . .what is there to talk about?

593
00:51:07,320 --> 00:51:09,880
Fucking squealer.

594
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:31,920
I forgive you, baby.

595
00:51:50,240 --> 00:51:52,680
Fuck you!

596
00:51:52,920 --> 00:51:55,800
Fuck you!

597
00:51:56,440 --> 00:51:58,880
You stupid bitch!

598
00:52:00,400 --> 00:52:03,440
Shut the fuck up!

599
00:52:03,920 --> 00:52:05,200
Kill them all!

600
00:52:05,440 --> 00:52:08,240
You bonehead sissy,
this is Jack Scagnetti!

601
00:52:08,480 --> 00:52:10,600
Put that gun down.

602
00:52:10,840 --> 00:52:13,480
Fuck you, Scagnetti!

603
00:52:13,720 --> 00:52:15,240
I'll cut her tits off!

604
00:52:15,480 --> 00:52:16,960
Go ahead, Scagnetti!

605
00:52:17,200 --> 00:52:19,520
I'll get her silicone implants!

606
00:52:19,760 --> 00:52:22,120
I swear to God, I'll cut her tits off!

607
00:52:22,360 --> 00:52:24,280
Go ahead! You ain't got the balls!

608
00:52:24,520 --> 00:52:28,160
-Don't give up! He won't do it!
-Shut up!

609
00:52:30,440 --> 00:52:32,200
Watch this!

610
00:52:32,440 --> 00:52:35,200
You like that?

611
00:52:35,720 --> 00:52:37,480
-Put that gun down!
-Don't cut her!

612
00:52:37,720 --> 00:52:40,880
Put your hands where I can see them
and step in the light!

613
00:52:41,120 --> 00:52:42,720
Kill them all!

614
00:52:42,960 --> 00:52:46,120
All right, I'm coming out!

615
00:52:48,480 --> 00:52:50,720
Hands where I can see them. Good boy.

616
00:52:50,960 --> 00:52:55,480
Step out in the light. Come on.

617
00:52:56,040 --> 00:52:57,920
Step outside, big shot.

618
00:52:58,160 --> 00:52:59,880
All right!

619
00:53:00,120 --> 00:53:03,280
Someone come get this bitch.
Get this bitch!

620
00:53:03,520 --> 00:53:07,200
Come get the big bad wolf!

621
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:10,360
Come on!

622
00:53:13,600 --> 00:53:15,600
You're in my light, motherfuckers!

623
00:53:15,840 --> 00:53:17,480
Hold your fire!

624
00:53:17,720 --> 00:53:19,320
Oh, God, my eye!

625
00:53:19,560 --> 00:53:21,120
Hold your fire!

626
00:53:21,360 --> 00:53:22,800
No! Do not kill him!

627
00:53:23,040 --> 00:53:24,920
One camera all you can muster?

628
00:53:25,160 --> 00:53:29,080
You ain't that big a star yet,
cocksucker.

629
00:53:29,240 --> 00:53:32,880
-You and me, one on one, let's go.
-Fuck you! Bring it!

630
00:53:33,120 --> 00:53:36,080
Fry this cop killer!

631
00:53:43,800 --> 00:53:46,560
How's that, big shot?

632
00:53:46,840 --> 00:53:49,120
Cop killer!

633
00:53:50,520 --> 00:53:51,640
Fuck you!

634
00:53:51,880 --> 00:53:55,400
Hey, Mickey. Want a drink?

635
00:53:55,480 --> 00:53:58,200
-Fuck you!
-Just joking.

636
00:53:58,360 --> 00:54:02,560
Where is my baby? Where is she?

637
00:54:04,360 --> 00:54:06,920
Let her go. Let her go.

638
00:54:07,160 --> 00:54:08,760
You okay, baby?

639
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:12,160
These boots were made for walking

640
00:54:12,400 --> 00:54:14,880
And that's just what they'll do

641
00:54:15,120 --> 00:54:20,880
One of these days these boots
Are gonna walk all over you

642
00:54:23,240 --> 00:54:27,040
No pictures! No pictures!

643
00:55:00,920 --> 00:55:02,760
Always wanted to meet you, Scagnetti.

644
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:04,400
I really respect you.

645
00:55:04,640 --> 00:55:07,400
You know what?
I even bought your book.

646
00:55:07,640 --> 00:55:11,880
I read the whole damn thing.
How about an autograph?

647
00:55:14,080 --> 00:55:16,800
Warden. . .

648
00:55:17,040 --> 00:55:19,360
. . .Jack Scagnetti.

649
00:55:19,600 --> 00:55:22,720
Dwight McClusky. Welcome to hell.

650
00:55:22,960 --> 00:55:24,600
Great to meet you, warden.

651
00:55:24,840 --> 00:55:26,720
How are my two favorite assholes?

652
00:55:26,960 --> 00:55:29,480
We got them two in there.
Wanna see them?

653
00:55:29,720 --> 00:55:31,680
-Why not?
-Come on.

654
00:55:31,920 --> 00:55:36,440
I seen you on TV. I even read
your goddamn book. I'm impressed.

655
00:55:36,680 --> 00:55:38,400
Surprised Hollywood ain't found you.

656
00:55:38,640 --> 00:55:41,200
Your story would be
a better movie than Serpico.

657
00:55:41,440 --> 00:55:44,200
In all of my days
in the penal business--

658
00:55:44,440 --> 00:55:47,360
And that ain't no small amount, right?

659
00:55:47,600 --> 00:55:51,320
Mickey and Mallory are
the most twisted, depraved fucks. . .

660
00:55:51,560 --> 00:55:53,880
. . .I have ever laid my damn eyes on.

661
00:55:54,120 --> 00:55:56,880
These two motherfuckers
are a walking reminder. . .

662
00:55:57,120 --> 00:55:58,720
. . .of how fucked up the system is.

663
00:55:58,960 --> 00:56:01,320
Don't get me started, okay, warden?

664
00:56:01,560 --> 00:56:02,520
Dwight.

665
00:56:02,760 --> 00:56:03,800
You call me Dwight.

666
00:56:04,040 --> 00:56:05,360
They killed inmates and guards?

667
00:56:05,600 --> 00:56:10,600
Three inmates, five guards
and one shrink. Open that damn gate.

668
00:56:10,840 --> 00:56:11,720
Psychiatrist?

669
00:56:11,960 --> 00:56:16,280
Mallory strangled him when he made the
mistake of asking about her parents.

670
00:56:16,520 --> 00:56:20,280
She done it shot up on tranquilizers.

671
00:56:23,040 --> 00:56:24,640
Ain't love grand?

672
00:56:24,880 --> 00:56:27,960
Ain't that the truth?
It's like that other big lie:

673
00:56:28,200 --> 00:56:31,440
"Love makes the world go around. "

674
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:35,320
How did you get to be
a specialist in psychos?

675
00:56:35,560 --> 00:56:37,880
I'd recommend having
your mother killed by one.

676
00:56:38,120 --> 00:56:40,800
After that, I developed
a keen interest.

677
00:56:41,040 --> 00:56:43,960
-What happened?
-I was born in Texas.

678
00:56:44,200 --> 00:56:46,800
-You don't have an accent.
-I don't want to talk like those asses.

679
00:56:47,040 --> 00:56:49,920
-My mother was from Texas.
-I mean the other asses.

680
00:56:50,160 --> 00:56:53,560
The ones who beat me up.
Anyway, when I was 8 years old. . .

681
00:56:53,800 --> 00:56:57,760
. . .my mother took me to the park.
It was the same day Charles Whitman. . .

682
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:01,240
. . .climbed the University of Texas Tower
and started shooting.

683
00:57:01,480 --> 00:57:03,080
-You was with her?
-Sure was.

684
00:57:03,320 --> 00:57:06,760
I didn't hear any of the shots.

685
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:10,080
I'm with my mother and suddenly. . .

686
00:57:11,080 --> 00:57:13,960
. . .chest explodes. She falls,
and I'm just looking at her.

687
00:57:14,200 --> 00:57:16,360
Her arm flies off, her hip explodes.

688
00:57:16,600 --> 00:57:19,680
And I'm not hearing any of the shots.

689
00:57:19,920 --> 00:57:23,720
Boom! Her chest exploded.

690
00:57:33,440 --> 00:57:36,960
I was lying on the grass being
eaten alive by ants, thinking:

691
00:57:37,200 --> 00:57:39,600
"What happened to my mom?"

692
00:57:39,840 --> 00:57:41,520
Since then, I've had
a strong opinion. . .

693
00:57:41,760 --> 00:57:45,160
. . .about the psychopathic fringe that
thrives in this fast-food culture.

694
00:57:45,400 --> 00:57:48,600
I don't show the self-discipline
becoming of a peace officer.

695
00:57:48,840 --> 00:57:53,960
You got it right, Jack.
You don't mind if I call you Jack?

696
00:57:56,560 --> 00:57:58,720
We got an army of shrinks.
Talks about mania...

697
00:57:58,960 --> 00:58:02,160
...and schizophrenia and multi-phrenia
and obsessions.

698
00:58:02,400 --> 00:58:04,280
And it makes me sick.

699
00:58:04,520 --> 00:58:08,680
It's arrogance, bullshit. Mickey and
Mallory are not the sickest I've seen.

700
00:58:08,920 --> 00:58:12,040
-Open it.
-Yes, sir.

701
00:58:19,520 --> 00:58:21,720
Why me? What's this really about?

702
00:58:21,960 --> 00:58:23,480
Can you feel it?

703
00:58:23,720 --> 00:58:25,600
Silence in the air?

704
00:58:25,840 --> 00:58:28,040
You don't want it in a prison.
