1
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:22,122
- Oh, my fuck!
Look who it is, man.

2
00:00:22,122 --> 00:00:24,624
- Is that him?
- Right there, right over there.

3
00:00:24,624 --> 00:00:26,426
Put your gun away,
there's people everywhere.

4
00:00:26,926 --> 00:00:28,928
Put your fucking gun away.
Put your gun down.

5
00:00:32,932 --> 00:00:34,434
Release the dog!
Leave him there!

6
00:00:34,934 --> 00:00:36,436
!
Walk away from the dog.
- Release the dog, asshole

7
00:00:36,936 --> 00:00:39,439
- Leave us alone!
- Release the dog then!

8
00:00:39,939 --> 00:00:41,441
- Release him!
Put the fucking gun down.

9
00:00:41,941 --> 00:00:43,443
!
- Put it down, put it down

10
00:00:43,943 --> 00:00:45,445
- Put the fucking gun down
right now!

11
00:00:45,945 --> 00:00:47,247
(gunshot)

12
00:00:47,447 --> 00:00:49,649
(screaming)

13
00:00:49,649 --> 00:00:51,651
(gunshots)

14
00:00:56,756 --> 00:00:59,259
- My name is Julian.
Today is a special day

15
00:00:59,759 --> 00:01:00,860
because I'm finally
getting out of prison.

16
00:01:01,361 --> 00:01:02,862
I've been looking forward
to this day

17
00:01:02,862 --> 00:01:04,364
.
for the past eighteen months

18
00:01:04,364 --> 00:01:06,166
- My name is Ricky
and I've been in here

19
00:01:06,166 --> 00:01:08,168
for about 18 months now.

20
00:01:08,168 --> 00:01:10,170
I'm getting out today,
thank fuck.

21
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:12,672
- Well, you guys are going
to get to know Ricky, I think,

22
00:01:13,173 --> 00:01:15,175
,
cause you know you guys want
to follow him around as well

23
00:01:15,675 --> 00:01:16,676
which is cool.

24
00:01:17,177 --> 00:01:19,179
- I'm tellin' ya, tonight,
I am getting drunk at Julian's

25
00:01:19,679 --> 00:01:22,182
and it's going to be awesome
. You guys wanna come tape it,

26
00:01:22,682 --> 00:01:24,184
that's fine, but we're going
to get really drunk.

27
00:01:24,684 --> 00:01:25,685
It's gonna be wicked.

28
00:01:25,685 --> 00:01:27,687
Hopefully, there'll
be a bit of dope around.

29
00:01:27,687 --> 00:01:30,690
- I've been like kind of lik
e a teacher to him, I guess,

30
00:01:30,690 --> 00:01:32,692
.
and I'm sick of teaching him

31
00:01:32,892 --> 00:01:34,394
,
I'm going to get out of prison

32
00:01:34,894 --> 00:01:36,396
I'm going to move back
to the trailer park.

33
00:01:36,896 --> 00:01:38,398
.
I'm going to live a good,
clean life, I've matured now

34
00:01:38,898 --> 00:01:40,900
Things are going to be
totally different.

35
00:02:27,547 --> 00:02:29,549
I do blame Ricky,
of course I do.

36
00:02:29,549 --> 00:02:33,052
Everybody knows he's
the reason why I went to jail.

37
00:02:33,052 --> 00:02:35,054
You know,
Ricky doesn't think.

38
00:02:35,054 --> 00:02:38,057
.
So, you know, I'm not goin
g to hang out with him anymore

39
00:02:38,057 --> 00:02:41,060
I'm just going to look out
for number one, which is me.

40
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:43,563
No more Ricky.

41
00:02:43,563 --> 00:02:45,865
,
- Julian can frig off,
if that's what he's tellin' ya

42
00:02:46,366 --> 00:02:48,868
.
because it's not my fault, it'
s Julian's fault we went to jail

43
00:02:49,369 --> 00:02:51,871
He's the one who force
feeding me drugs and
every other goddam thing.

44
00:02:52,372 --> 00:02:54,374
It's not my fault.
So, you know, if that's
what he says, that's fine.

45
00:02:54,874 --> 00:02:56,376
e
It doesn't matter anyway
cause the councilor's told m

46
00:02:56,876 --> 00:02:58,478
it's society's fault
not my fault.

47
00:02:58,478 --> 00:03:01,481
If Julian's going
to be like that then fine,
I'll blame it on him

48
00:03:01,481 --> 00:03:03,983
cause it's his fault we went
to jail three times.

49
00:03:03,983 --> 00:03:06,186
I don't need Julian anymore.

50
00:03:06,186 --> 00:03:07,987
- Right on, man!
I thought you'd left.

51
00:03:07,987 --> 00:03:09,989
- No, no, no.
Ricky, get your own cab.

52
00:03:09,989 --> 00:03:11,991
?
- What are you talking about

53
00:03:11,991 --> 00:03:14,494
- You're getting your own cab.
You're not sharing my cab.

54
00:03:14,494 --> 00:03:17,497
- I'm going back
to the trailer park.
- D'ya got any money?

55
00:03:17,497 --> 00:03:19,999
- No, that's why I need a ride
. - Well, get your own cab.

56
00:03:19,999 --> 00:03:22,001
- This is how you want
to treat me on camera?

57
00:03:22,001 --> 00:03:25,004
!
- Here. Here's your bag.
- Don't throw my shit around

58
00:03:31,110 --> 00:03:33,112
?
- Could you guys turn that off

59
00:03:36,616 --> 00:03:38,918
If you've ever been in jai
l before, there's nothin' better

60
00:03:38,918 --> 00:03:41,421
than gettin' out of jail
and comin' home.

61
00:03:45,425 --> 00:03:47,427
Geez, she's gotten bigger.

62
00:03:52,432 --> 00:03:55,635
- Ricky and Julian?
Well, for the most part,

63
00:03:55,635 --> 00:03:59,138
they're responsible for ruinin
g this trailer park.

64
00:03:59,138 --> 00:04:02,141
Used to be peaceful
and quiet here.

65
00:04:02,141 --> 00:04:04,143
,
You know, what gets me most is

66
00:04:04,143 --> 00:04:06,145
all the young kids
look up to him!

67
00:04:06,145 --> 00:04:08,147
I mean, I got kids
flying around here,

68
00:04:08,147 --> 00:04:11,651
throwin' bottles at people
, growing dope, squealing tires,

69
00:04:11,651 --> 00:04:13,653
jumping motorcycles
over trailers...

70
00:04:13,653 --> 00:04:15,655
The list goes on.

71
00:04:15,655 --> 00:04:18,658
,
And I've been park superviso
r here for goin' on 16 years

72
00:04:18,658 --> 00:04:21,160
I've seen it all, but those two,
particularly Ricky,

73
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:23,162
they're the worst.

74
00:04:25,164 --> 00:04:27,066
- Gimme your smokes, Gordon.
Give me your smokes!

75
00:04:27,367 --> 00:04:28,968
Give me 15 bucks, man.

76
00:04:28,968 --> 00:04:31,471
.
Come on, I know you've got
some smokes here somewhere

77
00:04:31,471 --> 00:04:33,473
- Okay, Ricky! Let him up!

78
00:04:33,473 --> 00:04:35,575
Ricky! Off! Get off him!

79
00:04:35,575 --> 00:04:38,077
- Let go of his foot.
- Gimme your smokes, man!

80
00:04:38,077 --> 00:04:40,580
- Let go, Ricky!
Get out of here!

81
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:43,082
- You frig off, Randy!
You frig off!

82
00:04:43,082 --> 00:04:44,784
- Back off, back off!
Stay clear!

83
00:04:44,784 --> 00:04:46,786
What was it like in jail,
hey, Buddy?

84
00:04:46,786 --> 00:04:48,788
- Where's Julian, Ricky?
- Where are you stayin', Rick?

85
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:50,890
.
- At the Fuck Off Hotel, Lahey

86
00:04:50,890 --> 00:04:52,892
- Have some respect here.
Mr Lahey is the park supervisor.

87
00:04:53,393 --> 00:04:54,894
- What are you,
his new assistant?

88
00:04:55,395 --> 00:04:59,399
- Yes, I am!
- Well, that's pretty fucked up.

89
00:04:59,399 --> 00:05:01,601
- This is Ricky's girl.
- I missed you.

90
00:05:01,601 --> 00:05:04,103
- I missed you too.

91
00:05:04,103 --> 00:05:07,607
- Is Ricky out of jail too
? - Yeah.

92
00:05:07,607 --> 00:05:10,610
- Are you going to come
and visit my mommy?

93
00:05:10,610 --> 00:05:12,612
- Um, I don't know. Maybe.

94
00:05:12,612 --> 00:05:15,615
- You're out of jail
and ya got no place to live?

95
00:05:15,615 --> 00:05:17,617
- I've got plenty of place
s to live.

96
00:05:17,617 --> 00:05:19,619
I could stay at any one
of these trailers

97
00:05:19,619 --> 00:05:21,621
cause people here like me.
Not like you dicks.

98
00:05:21,621 --> 00:05:24,123
- Things have changed, Rick.
- Things have changed,
have they?

99
00:05:24,123 --> 00:05:27,126
.
- Ya. You're going to have
to keep your nose clean, Ricky

100
00:05:27,126 --> 00:05:29,128
- Smokes, let's go,
give me some smokes.

101
00:05:29,128 --> 00:05:31,631
.
- I've only got two left
and I'm not giving you any

102
00:05:31,631 --> 00:05:33,633
- You're a fucking dick.

103
00:05:33,633 --> 00:05:35,635
And Lahey, you can go
fuck yourself, okay?

104
00:05:35,635 --> 00:05:38,137
Stay out of my business.

105
00:05:38,137 --> 00:05:40,139
- What a jerk, man.

106
00:05:40,139 --> 00:05:41,641
- Ricky's back.

107
00:05:42,141 --> 00:05:44,744
- Okay, so this is where I live.

108
00:05:45,244 --> 00:05:48,247
I leave this place
for 18 months and let
Cory and Trevor stay here

109
00:05:48,247 --> 00:05:49,749
and look what they do.

110
00:05:49,749 --> 00:05:51,551
- When Julian gets back,
it's gonna be so cool.

111
00:05:51,551 --> 00:05:55,054
The whole crew's gonna hang ou
t again, rock the trailer park
like we used to.

112
00:05:55,054 --> 00:05:56,756
So, we're going to clean
the place up.

113
00:05:56,756 --> 00:05:58,758
It's a little messy now
and everything,

114
00:05:58,758 --> 00:06:00,760
but we've got lots of time
to clean it up.

115
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:03,763
.
We'll have it looking
as good as it was when he left

116
00:06:23,383 --> 00:06:25,385
- What the hell happened
to my trailer, boys?!

117
00:06:27,387 --> 00:06:28,888
,
- Okay, chill.
There's this guy named Cyrus

118
00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:30,890
he just moved in here.

119
00:06:31,391 --> 00:06:32,892
There's nothin' we could d
o about it.

120
00:06:33,393 --> 00:06:34,894
.
He has a gun and he's nuts

121
00:06:34,894 --> 00:06:36,896
- Yeah, I moved into
his trailer.

122
00:06:36,896 --> 00:06:38,898
Nice little spot.

123
00:06:38,898 --> 00:06:41,401
The way I see it,
this fucking Julian guy,

124
00:06:41,901 --> 00:06:43,403
he lost his privileges

125
00:06:43,903 --> 00:06:45,405
when he went off to
Con College, you see?

126
00:06:45,905 --> 00:06:47,407
I'm the guy that owns
the trailer now.

127
00:06:47,907 --> 00:06:49,409
.
I'm runnin' the trailer park

128
00:06:49,909 --> 00:06:52,412
And if that big tough
fuckin' guy comes runnin'
around here,

129
00:06:52,912 --> 00:06:56,416
throwing his little
bit of weight around,
well then, fuck off!

130
00:06:56,416 --> 00:06:59,118
- We'll help you find
a new place to live, Julian.

131
00:06:59,118 --> 00:07:01,120
- This is my place, you idiot!

132
00:07:03,623 --> 00:07:05,625
.
I'm disappointed in you guys

133
00:07:06,926 --> 00:07:09,929
.
Gone for 18 months,
and you knew I'd be home today

134
00:07:09,929 --> 00:07:12,932
- Shit happens!
It's not our fault.
- Shut up!

135
00:07:12,932 --> 00:07:16,436
You guys let me down.

136
00:07:16,936 --> 00:07:20,039
- But Cyrus, like,
he killed a kid when
he was in reform school.

137
00:07:20,039 --> 00:07:21,541
He got even harder
when he was there.

138
00:07:21,541 --> 00:07:24,043
He stole cars and
he has a nine millimeter.

139
00:07:24,544 --> 00:07:26,045
g
Lahey's afraid to do anythin

140
00:07:26,045 --> 00:07:28,548
.
cause he's worried about
getting knocked out by him too

141
00:07:28,548 --> 00:07:30,550
It's like he's the new
park king or something, man.

142
00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:32,051
- Shit changes, man.

143
00:07:33,553 --> 00:07:35,555
He's not even from the park.

144
00:07:35,555 --> 00:07:38,958
He thinks it's cool to liv
e in a trailer park.

145
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:42,962
?
- So what are you gonna do

146
00:07:42,962 --> 00:07:44,964
- I don't know.

147
00:07:44,964 --> 00:07:46,966
But I know what you guys
are gonna do.

148
00:07:46,966 --> 00:07:48,968
Your going to start
cleaning up this mess.

149
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:51,971
Now!

150
00:07:51,971 --> 00:07:53,973
- I don't think we got
any cleaners.

151
00:07:53,973 --> 00:07:55,975
- Clean it up!

152
00:07:55,975 --> 00:07:57,677
- What are you guys taping
in here?

153
00:07:57,677 --> 00:07:59,378
You have to have permission.

154
00:07:59,378 --> 00:08:01,881
- A friend of mine's
doing a documentary,
don't worry about it.

155
00:08:01,881 --> 00:08:03,883
- All right.
- Look, I need some stuff.

156
00:08:03,883 --> 00:08:05,685
I could rob ya or you
could just give it to me.

157
00:08:05,685 --> 00:08:07,687
- You're Ricky, right?
- Ya, man.

158
00:08:07,687 --> 00:08:10,189
- You can get whatever
you want, I don't care.

159
00:08:10,189 --> 00:08:12,191
,
- Gimme four packs of smokes

160
00:08:12,191 --> 00:08:14,694
and I'll take these flower
s here I guess--

161
00:08:14,694 --> 00:08:16,696
.
- Smokes! Grab my smokes there

162
00:08:16,696 --> 00:08:19,198
- I was here first, bud.

163
00:08:19,198 --> 00:08:21,701
- What's that camera doing here?

164
00:08:21,701 --> 00:08:23,703
- None of your fucking
business, actually.

165
00:08:25,705 --> 00:08:27,707
- Obviously, you don't kno
w who the fuck I am.

166
00:08:27,707 --> 00:08:29,709
The name is Cyrus.

167
00:08:29,709 --> 00:08:32,712
Cyrus! And I don't give a fuck
who you are.

168
00:08:34,714 --> 00:08:37,216
- You better chill out there
, heavy metal dick.

169
00:08:37,216 --> 00:08:40,219
?
- Why don't you go back
to the bowling alley
you came from, helmet head

170
00:08:40,219 --> 00:08:42,221
- You're fucking lucky
I'm on probation.

171
00:08:42,221 --> 00:08:44,223
- Is that right? See ya!

172
00:08:44,223 --> 00:08:45,725
That's it, bye-bye.

173
00:08:45,725 --> 00:08:47,727
- That'll be... Wait, Cyrus!
You didn't pay.

174
00:08:47,727 --> 00:08:49,228
- Fuck off, man.

175
00:09:02,942 --> 00:09:04,644
- Yeah, yeah. I'm J-Roc

176
00:09:05,144 --> 00:09:06,646

180
00:09:13,653 --> 00:09:16,255
(all talking at once)

181
00:09:18,257 --> 00:09:19,759
- Hey, what's up?

182
00:09:19,759 --> 00:09:21,260

Good to see ya, man

186
00:09:27,266 --> 00:09:29,268
- Not much.
- Hey, what's going on, man?

187
00:09:29,268 --> 00:09:31,270
- We're doin' all right.
It's all good.

188
00:09:31,270 --> 00:09:33,272
?
- So, how are things goin'

189
00:09:34,774 --> 00:09:36,776
What's wrong?

190
00:09:37,276 --> 00:09:39,278
- Me and T got some bad news, G.

191
00:09:39,278 --> 00:09:41,280
- Yeah. Cyrus, man.

192
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:43,783
,
- He all up in this park
controllin' all the liquor

193
00:09:43,783 --> 00:09:46,285
sellin' all the dope,
you know wha I'm sayin?

194
00:09:46,285 --> 00:09:48,287
Got a gun runnin' around,

195
00:09:48,287 --> 00:09:49,889
.
actin' hard with everybody

196
00:09:50,389 --> 00:09:52,391
- You're not the king
of the park anymore.

197
00:09:52,892 --> 00:09:54,393
?
- Boys, listen up, all right

198
00:09:54,894 --> 00:09:56,395
I'm out of jail now.

199
00:09:56,896 --> 00:09:58,397
This is my trailer,
this is my home.

200
00:09:58,898 --> 00:10:01,901
I'm not worried about Cyrus,
all right? Don't worry about it.

201
00:10:01,901 --> 00:10:04,203
Come on!
So, what's goin on?

202
00:10:04,203 --> 00:10:06,205
- We doin' all right.

203
00:10:06,205 --> 00:10:09,208
?
We be dope when the new NW
A come out, know what I'm sayin'

204
00:10:11,010 --> 00:10:13,012
- I haven't seen
Lucy and Trinity

205
00:10:13,012 --> 00:10:15,014
.
since Trinity's 7th birthday

206
00:10:15,014 --> 00:10:17,016
No, it was her 8th birthday.

207
00:10:17,016 --> 00:10:19,018
No, no, it was her 7th birthday.

208
00:10:19,018 --> 00:10:22,021
Anyway, I was in jail
for her 7th or 8th birthday.

209
00:10:23,522 --> 00:10:25,524
And you know, they never
really got a chance

210
00:10:25,524 --> 00:10:28,027
to come visit me in jail.

211
00:10:28,027 --> 00:10:30,529
A year and a half is quite
a long time

212
00:10:30,529 --> 00:10:34,033
to go without seeing
your daughter

213
00:10:34,033 --> 00:10:38,037
or the woman you love,
for that matter, I guess.

214
00:10:38,037 --> 00:10:39,939
- Come on, boys!
This is Bubbles!

215
00:10:39,939 --> 00:10:42,942
How are ya doin', buddy?
It's good to see ya, man.

216
00:10:42,942 --> 00:10:44,944
- That's my best friend Julian
.

217
00:10:44,944 --> 00:10:46,946
- Yeah, what's up?
- What are you doing?

218
00:10:46,946 --> 00:10:48,948
Home from jail?
- Yeah, got out today.

219
00:10:49,448 --> 00:10:51,450
- Who's this guy?
What am I on the TV for?

220
00:10:51,951 --> 00:10:53,452
- I'm just doing a little
documentary thing, you know.

221
00:10:53,953 --> 00:10:55,454
- How are you doing?
- Good.

222
00:10:55,454 --> 00:10:57,456
?
- So, what's going on anyway

223
00:10:57,957 --> 00:10:59,959
- Well, I don't know
if you were in there yet,

224
00:11:00,459 --> 00:11:01,961
but dickhead moved
into your trailer.

225
00:11:01,961 --> 00:11:04,964
I tried to stop him,
but I couldn't.
- Yeah, Cyrus.

226
00:11:04,964 --> 00:11:06,966
- He keeps sticking
a fucking gun at my face.

227
00:11:07,366 --> 00:11:08,367
- See this?

228
00:11:08,868 --> 00:11:09,869
All right?

229
00:11:10,369 --> 00:11:13,973
Old man gave me that
when I was in grade seven.

230
00:11:13,973 --> 00:11:15,975
Seen a lot of action.

231
00:11:15,975 --> 00:11:17,476
Nine millimeter,

232
00:11:18,978 --> 00:11:21,480
Safety: always off.

233
00:11:23,482 --> 00:11:25,484
Told me he was proud of me once.

234
00:11:26,485 --> 00:11:27,987
Fucking prick!

235
00:11:29,989 --> 00:11:31,891
- Cory and Trevor let him move
right in.

236
00:11:31,891 --> 00:11:33,893
You can move in here with me
if you want.

237
00:11:34,393 --> 00:11:36,896
- No, that's all right.
I'm going to take care of Cyrus.

238
00:11:37,396 --> 00:11:39,899
- I think you should.
- What do you think I should do?

239
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:42,902
.
- I talked to him
a couple of times and
he's fucking scared of you

240
00:11:43,402 --> 00:11:44,904
He's waitin', wonderin'
when you're coming home.

241
00:11:45,404 --> 00:11:46,906
- Yeah?
- Yup!

242
00:11:47,406 --> 00:11:48,908
All I got to do is tell hi
m you're here

243
00:11:49,408 --> 00:11:50,910
and I bet ya he fucking bolts.

244
00:11:51,410 --> 00:11:53,913
- I don't know if it's going t
o be that easy, but, you know...

245
00:11:54,413 --> 00:11:55,414
I just got to watch it.

246
00:11:55,915 --> 00:11:57,917
I'm on probation and I'm not
going back to jail.

247
00:11:58,417 --> 00:11:59,919
- You won't have to worry
about that.

248
00:12:00,419 --> 00:12:01,921
Everybody in the fucking par
k hates him.

249
00:12:01,921 --> 00:12:03,923
Lahey, everybody...
Nobody fucking likes him.

250
00:12:03,923 --> 00:12:05,925
He fucked everyone over.

251
00:12:05,925 --> 00:12:07,927
- All right.
Well maybe, you know,

252
00:12:07,927 --> 00:12:10,429
if you could get word
around the park

253
00:12:10,429 --> 00:12:13,432
.
and tell everybody
I'm throwing him out tonight

254
00:12:13,432 --> 00:12:15,434
- Yeah, I can do that.
Don't worry about that.

255
00:12:15,434 --> 00:12:18,437
I'll go around door to fucking
door if I have to.

256
00:12:18,437 --> 00:12:20,940
- Enough of that stuff.
It's just good to see ya.

257
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:23,142
(loud heavy metal music playing)

258
00:12:29,248 --> 00:12:30,950
- I hear you're Ricky,

259
00:12:30,950 --> 00:12:32,752
.
Julian's little jail buddy

260
00:12:32,752 --> 00:12:35,755
- Are you filming more episode
s of Happy Days, there, Fonzy?

261
00:12:35,755 --> 00:12:37,757
- Listen, just give me
your fucking smokes.

262
00:12:37,757 --> 00:12:40,760
- Buddy, I just got out of jail,
I don't want any trouble.

263
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:42,762
Put the gun away.

264
00:12:42,762 --> 00:12:44,764
You're on camera
with a fucking gun.

265
00:12:46,766 --> 00:12:48,768
- I don't give a fuck
about the camera crew, okay?

266
00:12:48,768 --> 00:12:51,771
Just give me your fucking smokes
or I'll put a bullet

267
00:12:51,771 --> 00:12:53,773
right through
your goddam ribcage!

268
00:12:53,773 --> 00:12:55,274
- For fuck's sakes.

269
00:12:58,778 --> 00:13:00,780
I've got four packs of smokes,
all right?

270
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:03,983
You can have two of them.
- No fucking thanks.

271
00:13:03,983 --> 00:13:06,485
- If you're going to shoot m
e over two packs of smokes,

272
00:13:06,485 --> 00:13:08,487
.
then go ahead and shoot me

273
00:13:08,487 --> 00:13:11,490
- It's your lucky fucking day,
isn't it, jail boy?

274
00:13:11,490 --> 00:13:14,193
Tell your friend Julian to get
the fuck out of the trailer park

275
00:13:14,193 --> 00:13:17,196
.
or he'll have Cyrus
and you know what to deal with

276
00:13:17,196 --> 00:13:19,698
Fuck off somewhere.
I've got work to do.

277
00:13:19,698 --> 00:13:21,901
- I don't even hang around
with Julian anymore.

278
00:13:30,910 --> 00:13:32,912
- What the fuck do you think
you're doing? What's this?

279
00:13:33,412 --> 00:13:34,914
- I come to talk to Lucy.
Don't worry about it.

280
00:13:35,414 --> 00:13:37,416
It's something Julian's doing.
- What, that Julian's doing?

281
00:13:37,917 --> 00:13:39,418
- Sarah, it doesn't matter
. Where's Lucy?

282
00:13:39,919 --> 00:13:41,420
- Lucy's not here.
- I know she's here.

283
00:13:41,921 --> 00:13:43,422
- She went to the park
or something,she's not here.

284
00:13:43,923 --> 00:13:45,424
- She snuck out the back door?
- She didn't sneak.

285
00:13:45,925 --> 00:13:47,426
She walked out the front doo
r with her daughter

286
00:13:47,927 --> 00:13:49,428
to go to the park.
- I'm not an idiot.

287
00:13:49,929 --> 00:13:51,430
- Sarah, who's at the door
? - Nobody's at the door!

288
00:13:51,931 --> 00:13:54,433
- Lucy, it's Ricky. Can I talk
to you for a minute, please?

289
00:13:54,934 --> 00:13:56,435
- I don't want you to come in,
not with all these people.

290
00:13:56,936 --> 00:13:58,938
- Come on in, guys.
- I don't want you to come in.

291
00:13:58,938 --> 00:14:00,439
- Don't shove me, Sarah.

292
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:02,441
- You can't come back here
after 18 months

293
00:14:02,441 --> 00:14:04,944
and expect to walk back in
the house like nothing happened!

294
00:14:04,944 --> 00:14:06,946
- Are you her fucking bodyguard?
- I'm not her bodyguard.

295
00:14:06,946 --> 00:14:08,948
I'm her roommate.
I'm livin' here,

296
00:14:08,948 --> 00:14:10,950
.
helping pay the bills
since your ass was in jail

297
00:14:10,950 --> 00:14:12,451
- I'm back and I'll be
paying the bills.

298
00:14:12,451 --> 00:14:13,953
- That's what you think!

299
00:14:17,656 --> 00:14:19,658
!
- Holy shit, you look good

300
00:14:24,663 --> 00:14:26,966
I just thought it'd be nic
e to spend some time together.

301
00:14:26,966 --> 00:14:28,968
I've been in jail for 18 months.
- Well, yeah, okay.

302
00:14:28,968 --> 00:14:32,471
- I'm not goin' to sleep here,
so don't worry about it.

303
00:14:32,471 --> 00:14:34,473
- You're kidding!

304
00:14:35,474 --> 00:14:37,476
You are kidding, right?
- What do you mean?

305
00:14:39,478 --> 00:14:41,981
- Ah, listen... uh...

306
00:14:43,482 --> 00:14:46,485
Keep that closed. Uh...

307
00:14:46,485 --> 00:14:48,487
u
Trinity and I cannot have yo

308
00:14:48,487 --> 00:14:51,490
coming in and out of our lives
like this.

309
00:14:51,490 --> 00:14:53,993
So just go stay with Ray.

310
00:14:53,993 --> 00:14:55,494
(loud music playing)

311
00:14:55,494 --> 00:14:58,497
- This is my dad's place.
It sounds like he's drunk again.

312
00:14:58,497 --> 00:15:01,500
.
So the best thing to do when
he's drunk is to stay away

313
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:03,502
I'd rather sleep
at the playground tonight.

314
00:15:03,502 --> 00:15:06,005
As much as I want to get drunk
, I'm not going in there.

315
00:15:06,005 --> 00:15:08,507
There could be women. God know
s what could be going on inside.

316
00:15:08,507 --> 00:15:10,009
Got to find somewhere else
to go, boys.

317
00:15:10,009 --> 00:15:14,013
?
- 10-8. You got a 10-8 there

318
00:15:14,513 --> 00:15:17,116
10-8, you got a 10-2?

319
00:15:17,116 --> 00:15:19,618
- Randy here.
All systems clear.

320
00:15:19,618 --> 00:15:21,620
- 10-4, Randy.

321
00:15:23,622 --> 00:15:26,125
You know, I ordinarily
don't like to do this,

322
00:15:26,125 --> 00:15:28,627
.
but I got to call the cops

323
00:15:28,627 --> 00:15:32,631
There's a potential shootout
going to be happening

324
00:15:32,631 --> 00:15:34,633
t
in the trailer park tonigh

325
00:15:34,633 --> 00:15:36,635
and I'm gonna call in
the heavies.

326
00:15:36,635 --> 00:15:38,637
- You know, that's really
unfair, Mr. Lahey.

327
00:15:38,637 --> 00:15:40,639
Julian's on probation,

328
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:43,642
he could go back to jail
for a really long time.

329
00:15:43,642 --> 00:15:46,645
- Julian's on probation,
Cyrus isn't.

330
00:15:46,645 --> 00:15:49,148
Cyrus will kill me.

331
00:15:49,148 --> 00:15:51,150
You got any better ideas?

332
00:15:51,150 --> 00:15:53,652
If not, put your shirt on
and shut up.

333
00:16:07,166 --> 00:16:10,169
,
- You know, there's a lot of
different personalities here

334
00:16:10,169 --> 00:16:12,171
in this trailer park,

335
00:16:12,171 --> 00:16:14,673
r
and every single person
tries to respect each othe

336
00:16:14,673 --> 00:16:16,175
except for Cyrus.

337
00:16:16,175 --> 00:16:18,677
He has no respect
for anyone but himself.

338
00:16:18,677 --> 00:16:21,180
And I don't really want
to call the police in here

339
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:23,182
o
and convince Mr. Lahey not t

340
00:16:23,182 --> 00:16:25,184
because I feel that
in this community,

341
00:16:25,184 --> 00:16:28,187
.
we should be able
to work things out ourselves

342
00:16:28,187 --> 00:16:29,888
- Cyrus ain't from the park,

343
00:16:29,888 --> 00:16:31,890
you know what I mean?

344
00:16:32,391 --> 00:16:34,893
Round here, it's all for all
and one for one.

345
00:16:35,394 --> 00:16:36,395
- That's right.

346
00:16:36,895 --> 00:16:38,397
- When a person ain't
from the park,

347
00:16:38,897 --> 00:16:40,899
they don't understand
the way shit goes down.

348
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:43,902
Like the J to the ROC,
like Tyrone does, my man here.

349
00:16:44,403 --> 00:16:46,405
You know what I'm sayin'?
When your from the park,

350
00:16:46,905 --> 00:16:48,407
it's all for one motherfucke
r and one motherfucker

351
00:16:48,907 --> 00:16:50,909
for all my fuckers everywhere,
you know wha' I'm sayin'?

352
00:16:51,410 --> 00:16:53,912
,
But if you come from outside
the park, you better watch out

353
00:16:54,413 --> 00:16:56,415
cause you got a whole bunc
h of park hustlers on your jock.

354
00:16:56,915 --> 00:16:58,417
- Got to stick together too,
it's like a family.

355
00:16:58,917 --> 00:17:00,919
- Your jock don't
stick together, but
the people stick together.

356
00:17:00,919 --> 00:17:02,921
That's the shit
I'm talkin' about.

357
00:17:02,921 --> 00:17:04,923
- Everyday, Mr. Lahey and 
I clean up this playground....

358
00:17:04,923 --> 00:17:06,925
(loud music playing)

359
00:17:08,427 --> 00:17:10,329
Shit! It's Cyrus.
- Don't you move!

360
00:17:10,829 --> 00:17:13,632
What's this I hear about
you callin' the cops, huh?

361
00:17:14,133 --> 00:17:16,735
What's this I hear about
you callin' the cops?

362
00:17:16,735 --> 00:17:18,737
.
- Whoa! Now listen,
there's people around here

363
00:17:18,737 --> 00:17:20,739
Just take it easy,
will ya, Cyrus?

364
00:17:20,739 --> 00:17:22,741
- I'll fucking make
the decisions around here.

365
00:17:22,741 --> 00:17:25,244
You got that, old man?
- Just back off, Cyrus.

366
00:17:25,244 --> 00:17:28,247
- Take  your hands off me,
Sasquatch.

367
00:17:28,247 --> 00:17:30,249
Now listen...
You listen to me, old man.

368
00:17:30,249 --> 00:17:33,252
.
You call the cops and
I'll make and example of you

369
00:17:33,252 --> 00:17:35,254
You understand me?

370
00:17:35,254 --> 00:17:37,756
- What's that supposed
to mean, Cyrus?

371
00:17:37,756 --> 00:17:39,758
- Bang!
I got to spell it for you?

372
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:43,262
Now, say you're sorry.

373
00:17:43,262 --> 00:17:44,763
- I'm sorry.

374
00:17:44,763 --> 00:17:47,766
- Kiss my hand.
- I'm not kissing your hand.

375
00:17:47,766 --> 00:17:49,268
- Kiss my hand.

376
00:17:49,268 --> 00:17:50,769
- Do it.

377
00:17:53,272 --> 00:17:56,275
- All right, fuck off.
I've got work to do.

378
00:18:05,784 --> 00:18:07,786
Remember what I said.

379
00:18:11,790 --> 00:18:13,292
- Oh, my God.

380
00:18:14,793 --> 00:18:17,796
.
- Me and Julian could definitely
take care of the Cyrus thing

381
00:18:17,796 --> 00:18:20,299
,
It's just that, number one

382
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:22,301
we're on probation.

383
00:18:22,801 --> 00:18:24,303
Which is no big deal but,
you know,

384
00:18:24,803 --> 00:18:26,305
I don't really want
to go back to jail.

385
00:18:26,805 --> 00:18:28,807
And number two or three
or whatever number we're on,

386
00:18:29,308 --> 00:18:30,809
I'm not going back to jail
for Julian

387
00:18:31,310 --> 00:18:34,313
cause I don't even
hang around him anymore.

388
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:43,522
(loud music playing)

389
00:18:57,436 --> 00:18:59,838
- We've got to make
a few things clear.

390
00:19:00,339 --> 00:19:01,840
- Sure.
- The two of us can't live

391
00:19:02,341 --> 00:19:03,842
in this trailer park together,
now can we?

392
00:19:04,343 --> 00:19:05,844
- Right. So I guess
someone's got to move.

393
00:19:06,345 --> 00:19:08,347
- That's what I'm talkin' about.

394
00:19:08,347 --> 00:19:10,449
!
(Cyrus): Hey, that's my shit

395
00:19:15,854 --> 00:19:18,357
Hey! That's my shit!

396
00:19:18,357 --> 00:19:20,359
That's my shit!

397
00:19:24,663 --> 00:19:27,266
Obviously, you didn't
hear me when I said,
"Clear out your own shit."

398
00:19:27,266 --> 00:19:29,268
Now, I want a new TV,
I want a VCR

399
00:19:29,268 --> 00:19:31,270
and I want my porn tapes
replaced

400
00:19:31,270 --> 00:19:33,272
because those were
the cr?me de la cr?me.

401
00:19:33,272 --> 00:19:35,774
- I want you out of this park.
- I'm not leaving.

402
00:19:35,774 --> 00:19:37,776
I provide a service
for these good people.

403
00:19:37,776 --> 00:19:39,778
They're like my family.

404
00:19:39,778 --> 00:19:41,780
Tell him, people, go on!

405
00:19:41,780 --> 00:19:44,283
By show of hands,
those who need his dope.

406
00:19:46,785 --> 00:19:48,787
- I'd like to take
this opportunity

407
00:19:48,787 --> 00:19:51,790
.
to let anybody know that m
e and Tyrone's open for business

408
00:19:51,790 --> 00:19:54,293
We can service all yo' dop
e needs, good prices too.

409
00:19:54,293 --> 00:19:56,795
.
you know what I'm sayin'?
- See? We don't need ya here

410
00:19:58,797 --> 00:20:00,799
- Well, I'm not leavin'

411
00:20:00,799 --> 00:20:02,801
and I'm not afraid
to use this gun.

412
00:20:02,801 --> 00:20:05,304
- I think you're afraid.
- Fuck afraid!

413
00:20:05,304 --> 00:20:08,307
My brain tells my finger to pull
the trigger and BOOM!

414
00:20:08,307 --> 00:20:11,310
Happens just like that.
- Let me talk to
your brain then.

415
00:20:11,310 --> 00:20:13,812
Hey, Cyrus' brain,
pull the trigger.

416
00:20:13,812 --> 00:20:16,315
- What a funny guy.

417
00:20:16,315 --> 00:20:17,816
- Pull the trigger!

418
00:20:17,816 --> 00:20:19,818
Do it! Do it!!

419
00:20:23,822 --> 00:20:26,225
.
You're not going to do it, man

420
00:20:26,225 --> 00:20:28,227
(man in the crowd):
Cyrus, you fucking dick!

421
00:20:28,227 --> 00:20:30,229
- Shut up!

422
00:20:30,229 --> 00:20:33,232
- Why don't you do yoursel
f a favor and get off
from the Park?

423
00:20:33,232 --> 00:20:35,734
You don't belong here,
this is my family.

424
00:20:35,734 --> 00:20:37,736
?
Why don't ya get out of here

425
00:20:37,736 --> 00:20:39,738
- I don't need this shit anyway.

426
00:20:48,547 --> 00:20:50,549
- Thanks for getting rid
of Cyrus for us, Julian.

427
00:20:50,549 --> 00:20:52,551
Now if you could just help
straighten Ricky out,

428
00:20:52,551 --> 00:20:54,052
we'd be all set.

429
00:20:54,052 --> 00:20:57,556
All right, everybody!
Party's over! Let's go home.

430
00:20:57,556 --> 00:20:59,558
- Welcome back, Julian.

431
00:20:59,558 --> 00:21:01,560
(man in the crowd):
Fuck off, Mr. Lahey!

432
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:04,062
- Come on, Randy,
let's go write this up.

433
00:21:20,579 --> 00:21:23,181
- All in all, I think we had
a pretty good day today, guys.

434
00:21:23,181 --> 00:21:26,184
It's time to have a few drinks
sit down, turn that thing off...

435
00:21:28,186 --> 00:21:31,189
- Man, I'm sorry to interrup
t your TV show.

436
00:21:31,189 --> 00:21:33,191
.
I've got nowhere to go, Julian

437
00:21:33,191 --> 00:21:35,694
Me and Lucy are all done
and my dad's drunk.

438
00:21:35,694 --> 00:21:37,696
I was just wonderin'
if I could, maybe,

439
00:21:37,696 --> 00:21:40,699
sleep in your car or something
. Man, I've got nowhere to go.

440
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:44,202
Thanks, Julian.

441
00:21:45,704 --> 00:21:48,206
(Julian): I can't believe
he's still out there.

442
00:21:48,206 --> 00:21:50,208
For the past 18 months,
I promised myself

443
00:21:50,208 --> 00:21:52,210
to stay away from him.

444
00:21:52,210 --> 00:21:55,213
I don't know, he's a good guy.

445
00:21:58,216 --> 00:22:00,218
- Take it easy, Julian.
I'm leavin'.

446
00:22:00,218 --> 00:22:02,220
- Relax, Ricky.
- I got nowhere to go.

447
00:22:02,220 --> 00:22:03,722
- Relax.

448
00:22:05,223 --> 00:22:08,226
Here, I got you some hot-dogs,

449
00:22:10,729 --> 00:22:13,732
I got you some vodka.

450
00:22:13,732 --> 00:22:16,234
- I appreciate this, Julian,
but I don't need your charity.

451
00:22:16,234 --> 00:22:18,737
- Ricky, it's okay, all right?

452
00:22:18,737 --> 00:22:20,739
Here, you can sleep
in the car for two days.

453
00:22:24,743 --> 00:22:26,745
- Thanks, buddy,
I appreciate that.

454
00:22:26,745 --> 00:22:29,748
- I want you out of
that car in two days
though Ricky, all right?

455
00:22:29,748 --> 00:22:31,750
- No, more than two weeks,
I promise, all right?
