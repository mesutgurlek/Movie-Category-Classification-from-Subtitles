something called The Ozaki Eight.

170
00:10:43,856 --> 00:10:46,671
This is Ono Ozaki.

171
00:10:46,673 --> 00:10:48,303
He was an eco-warrior,

172
00:10:48,305 --> 00:10:51,374
one of the first recognized
Extreme Poly-Athletes.

173
00:10:51,376 --> 00:10:53,167

Extreme Sports world</i>

175

180

It's about spiritual enlightenment?

181
00:11:15,278 --> 00:11:16,591
Exactly.

182
00:11:16,593 --> 00:11:19,535
An extreme athlete could potentially train

183
00:11:19,537 --> 00:11:23,393
their entire life just to
attempt one of these ordeals.

184
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:25,807
To complete all eight

185
00:11:25,809 --> 00:11:27,394
would be to complete the impossible.

186

No one's ever done it.

187

attempting his third ordeal.

188
