GANGSTER: So there's
a nigger, a kike and a wop

2
00:01:36,797 --> 00:01:39,232
and they get surrounded by Indians.

3
00:01:39,233 --> 00:01:42,569
The chief walks to them.
He says, "Listen, we're gonna kill you,

4
00:01:42,570 --> 00:01:44,370
"we're gonna skin you,
we're gonna boil you.

"But you get one final request."

7
00:01:49,143 --> 00:01:53,246
So the chief walks up to the nigger, and
of course he orders a bucket of chicken.

8
00:01:53,247 --> 00:01:55,381
He eats it, he's killed.

9
00:01:55,382 --> 00:01:59,619
They skin him, they boil him, and
they make a canoe out of him.

10
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:03,857
So the chief goes up to the
Jew, "What do you wish for?"

11
00:02:03,858 --> 00:02:06,359
He says "I'll have
a knish and a bagel."

12
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:08,261
But he takes his time eating it.

13
00:02:08,262 --> 00:02:10,563
Then they kill him,
they skin him, they boil him,

14
00:02:10,564 --> 00:02:12,832
they make a canoe out of him.

15
00:02:12,833 --> 00:02:15,602
And finally, the chief
walks up to the wop.

16
00:02:15,603 --> 00:02:16,870
He says, "What do you want?"

17
00:02:16,871 --> 00:02:19,906
The Italian says, "I want a fork."

18
00:02:19,907 --> 00:02:22,642
The chief says,
"What do you want a fork for?

19
00:02:22,643 --> 00:02:24,410
"You don't want something else?"

20
00:02:24,411 --> 00:02:27,714
The Italian says,
"No, give me a fork!"

21
00:02:27,715 --> 00:02:29,616
He says, "We don't have a fork!"

22
00:02:29,617 --> 00:02:31,483
He says, "Find me a fucking fork!"

23
00:02:33,286 --> 00:02:35,354
So the chief goes out,

24
00:02:36,456 --> 00:02:41,461
finds him a fork, he brings
it over, hands it to him.

25
00:02:41,462 --> 00:02:45,398
He walks straight up to the chief.
He says, "Here's your fucking canoe!

"Ma, I'm coming!

Well, we... We, uh,
we had some problems.

161
00:14:28,001 --> 00:14:31,536
But that's behind us.

162
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:36,441
I just wanna try to help.

163
00:14:38,410 --> 00:14:41,013
You've always been
good to me, Frank.

164
00:14:41,014 --> 00:14:42,948
You know I trust you.

165
00:14:42,949 --> 00:14:46,118
It's just, um, I don't
want any trouble here.

166
00:14:46,119 --> 00:14:47,585
I understand that.

167
00:14:53,225 --> 00:14:55,660
It would really help me out.

168
00:14:55,661 --> 00:14:57,229
Can you help me?

169
00:14:57,230 --> 00:14:58,663
I might, yes.

170
00:14:59,465 --> 00:15:01,267
I still need to ask Fabio.

171
00:15:01,268 --> 00:15:03,936
He is the one who runs the
joint here, you know.

172
00:15:03,937 --> 00:15:06,272
That's who calls the shots.

173
00:15:06,273 --> 00:15:08,506
I'll talk to him.
Okay, thanks.

174
00:15:09,930 --> 00:15:14,379
Clean this spill here. When you are
done, go and clean the bathroom. Okay?

175
00:15:22,087 --> 00:15:26,225
I'm gonna try to, uh, find
you a better mattress, too.

176
00:15:26,226 --> 00:15:27,960
It's fine. Don't worry about it.

177
00:15:27,961 --> 00:15:29,495
All right, well, you know,
make yourself at home, dude.

178
00:15:29,496 --> 00:15:31,330
Oh, the toilet's broken

179
00:15:31,331 --> 00:15:34,500
so, if you wanna flush it,

180
00:15:34,501 --> 00:15:36,635
you gotta jiggle the, the bar
and if that, that doesn't work,

181
00:15:36,636 --> 00:15:38,404
you gotta lift the ball inside.
Yeah, no problem.

182
00:15:38,405 --> 00:15:40,339
But I'm serious about this
because the whole thing will...

183
00:15:40,340 --> 00:15:41,880
Will flood if you don't...
All right.

184
00:15:42,308 --> 00:15:43,688
I got it. It's good.

185
00:15:47,346 --> 00:15:49,447
FRANK: You want a beer?

186
00:16:05,531 --> 00:16:07,365
Here, an ashtray.

187
00:16:09,735 --> 00:16:11,737
You know those guys?

188
00:16:11,738 --> 00:16:12,838
No.

189
00:16:18,677 --> 00:16:21,212
So, uh, how was
first day at the lot?

190
00:16:24,116 --> 00:16:25,716
It was okay.

191
00:16:30,689 --> 00:16:33,325
It's a start though, right?

192
00:16:33,326 --> 00:16:36,194
I'm sure something...
Something better's gonna come up.

193
00:16:46,572 --> 00:16:50,174
These guys don't look familiar to you?
Frank, do me a favor.

194
00:17:15,267 --> 00:17:17,235
(SLOW MUSIC PLAYING)

195
00:17:25,210 --> 00:17:27,346
Stranger?

196
00:17:27,347 --> 00:17:29,214
Jesus Christ, you scared me, man.

197
00:17:29,215 --> 00:17:32,051
What do you say, Chris!
What are you doing, man?

198
00:17:32,052 --> 00:17:33,252
Whoa!
Hey.

199
00:17:33,253 --> 00:17:34,820
It's about fucking time, man.

200
00:17:34,821 --> 00:17:36,321
How you're doing?
Look at you, man!

201
00:17:36,322 --> 00:17:38,690
Oh, man.
I'm doing all right now.

202
00:17:38,691 --> 00:17:40,759
What about Big Sal?

203
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:43,829
Oh, man! You won't be seeing
him around here no more.

204
00:17:43,830 --> 00:17:46,331
He bought a bar,
over in Manhattan.

205
00:17:46,332 --> 00:17:47,666
He's doing all right.

206
00:17:47,667 --> 00:17:49,835
I hear he plays poker
with the DA these days.

207
00:17:49,836 --> 00:17:52,456
Can you imagine?
That scumbag.

208
00:17:54,473 --> 00:17:56,653
What about you, Chris?
Any plans?

209
00:17:57,376 --> 00:17:59,343
Keep the judge happy.

210
00:18:29,508 --> 00:18:32,928
Here where it says "print" and then
the timing when she got here...

211
00:18:41,787 --> 00:18:45,489
I'm gonna... I'm also gonna give
you some forms to fill out.

212
00:18:47,893 --> 00:18:50,162
So, please fill these out.

213
00:18:50,163 --> 00:18:52,583
You keep the pen.
Thank you.

214
00:18:56,869 --> 00:18:59,204
(WHISPERING) What are
you doing here?

215
00:18:59,205 --> 00:19:01,206
Well, I didn't know
you worked there.

216
00:19:01,207 --> 00:19:03,842
I just wanted to see
how you was doing.

217
00:19:03,843 --> 00:19:06,546
What do you want from
me, huh? He's in jail.

218
00:19:06,547 --> 00:19:08,948
Don't you feel like you fucked
things up enough already?

219
00:19:09,047 --> 00:19:10,549
Hey, wait a second. He is the
one who fucked things up!

220
00:19:10,550 --> 00:19:12,350
Get out of here!

221
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:16,387
I'm sorry.

222
00:19:20,225 --> 00:19:22,560
You been following me for weeks.

223
00:19:24,930 --> 00:19:26,597
I've seen you.

224
00:19:28,934 --> 00:19:30,868
What do you want, Frank?

225
00:19:32,838 --> 00:19:35,274
Okay. (SIGHING)

226
00:19:35,275 --> 00:19:36,708
I been thinking about you a lot.

227
00:19:36,709 --> 00:19:38,177
I been thinking about
what's happened between us.

228
00:19:38,178 --> 00:19:39,878
I been thinking about
how it ended,

229
00:19:39,879 --> 00:19:41,647
and I've been worried about you,

230
00:19:41,648 --> 00:19:43,315
and I wanted to see if we
could be friends, okay?

231
00:19:43,316 --> 00:19:45,517
I just wanted to see
if I could be there for you

232
00:19:45,518 --> 00:19:48,653
if you needed me sometime.
That's all I wanted, okay?

233
00:19:51,657 --> 00:19:53,424
Yeah?
Yeah.

234
00:19:57,396 --> 00:19:59,536
Can you be seen with me now?

235
00:20:02,201 --> 00:20:03,502
Can you be seen
with the "colored girl"?

236
00:20:03,503 --> 00:20:05,604
Come on, that's not, I...

237
00:20:05,605 --> 00:20:06,805
You just said it yourself, that was
a long time ago. Yes, yes, yes.

238
00:20:06,806 --> 00:20:08,340
And that things are different now.

239
00:20:08,341 --> 00:20:09,721
Leave me alone.

240
00:20:13,579 --> 00:20:16,959
Don't ever come back here again.
Do you hear me?

241
00:20:38,670 --> 00:20:39,970
(SOBBING)

242
00:20:43,008 --> 00:20:44,675
What's wrong?

243
00:20:47,279 --> 00:20:50,915
Natalie, what is it?
What's the matter?

244
00:20:51,650 --> 00:20:53,484
$40 short.

245
00:20:54,953 --> 00:20:56,955
It's the second time in 10 days.

246
00:20:56,956 --> 00:20:58,390
I already had to spend $50

247
00:20:58,391 --> 00:20:59,925
out of my own pocket last week.

248
00:20:59,926 --> 00:21:02,861
You need help recounting it?
No.

249
00:21:02,862 --> 00:21:06,365
(SNIFFLES) No, I already counted
three goddamned times. It's gone.

250
00:21:06,366 --> 00:21:08,000
Okay, so there's 40 bucks missing.

251
00:21:08,001 --> 00:21:09,401
It's not the end of the world.

252
00:21:09,402 --> 00:21:10,801
Yeah, maybe not to you.

253
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:24,140
There you go, end of story.

254
00:21:24,716 --> 00:21:25,884
No, no, no.
It's... It's not about...

255
00:21:25,885 --> 00:21:27,551
End of story.

256
00:21:43,635 --> 00:21:45,070
How're you doing?

257
00:21:45,071 --> 00:21:47,572
A bunch of us are going to dinner.

258
00:21:47,573 --> 00:21:48,773
Do you wanna come?

259
00:21:50,409 --> 00:21:52,189
Sure.
Well, get in.

(ROMANTIC MUSIC PLAYING)

261
00:24:09,047 --> 00:24:11,715
Okay, just stop holding onto me.

262
00:24:12,517 --> 00:24:13,952
I lost a lung not a leg.

263

here, and get me some cigarettes.

265
00:24:31,385 --> 00:24:34,273
Would you, please?
MARIE: Cigarettes? Dad, are you crazy?

Hey, Pop?
Yeah.

Can I ask you something?
Sure!

269
00:24:50,621 --> 00:24:54,226
When I went to your house to get
all the stuff for the hospital,

270
00:24:54,227 --> 00:24:56,161
I found a letter.
Yeah.

271
00:24:56,162 --> 00:24:58,163
Uh, from Mom.

272
00:24:58,164 --> 00:25:00,499
And, you know,
you always told us that

273
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:04,269
she, she left us and...
That's right.

274
00:25:04,270 --> 00:25:07,038
Well, the letter, you
know, it's to the judge

and she's begging,
begging him for custody

276
00:25:09,876 --> 00:25:12,336
because I was so young when you...

277

"When you" what?
You was too young "when you..."

"When you" what?
When I what?

When I wouldn't let you grow
up in a whorehouse, huh?

Listen, your mother...
(PANTING)

281
00:25:24,690 --> 00:25:26,525
Your mother was a bitch!

She was a real bitch.

283
00:25:28,194 --> 00:25:30,762
She beat the shit out of
your brother and sister

on a daily basis with whatever
she had in her hands.

285
00:25:32,899 --> 00:25:38,169
She was a violent drunk, she
was a twisted, fucking slut!

286
00:25:38,170 --> 00:25:42,240
And it was because
of your fucking safety...

287
00:25:42,241 --> 00:25:45,010
It was because of your safety
that I kicked her out.

Your safety. Yours.

289
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:52,383
So you have... You have no memories
of her! You got none!

290

You have none, and if you did,
you'd throw up. I promise you.

it didn't matter to me,

it didn't matter to... to her.

294

It didn't matter to any of us.

Well, look, just stay
out of the past, son.

296

Just stay out of
the God damned past

and... and live
your own life now, okay?

Hi, Daddy.
Hey.

304
00:27:31,983 --> 00:27:33,952
She has an ear ache.

305
00:27:33,953 --> 00:27:35,120
Oh, has she got a fever?

306
00:27:35,121 --> 00:27:37,261
Yeah, but it's going down.

307
00:27:37,889 --> 00:27:40,091
Hey. How are you?

308
00:27:40,092 --> 00:27:41,392
How are you?
Are you all right?

309
00:27:41,826 --> 00:27:43,962
What's it look like?

310
00:27:43,963 --> 00:27:45,664
How are you?
You need anything?

311
00:27:45,665 --> 00:27:47,005
No.

312
00:27:49,067 --> 00:27:51,435
Wait. Look what I got for you.

313
00:27:53,104 --> 00:27:54,104
You like it?

Yes.

What?

317
00:28:08,020 --> 00:28:10,055
Is it true?
What?

00:28:10,056 --> 00:28:12,123
That they got nothing?

319
00:28:12,124 --> 00:28:14,825
No. I mean yes, it's true, yeah.

320
00:28:21,466 --> 00:28:23,267
You promised me.

321
00:28:25,904 --> 00:28:28,084
You said this wouldn't happen.

322
00:28:28,973 --> 00:28:31,314
And look where we are now.

323
00:28:31,910 --> 00:28:34,312
Babe, babe.
I can't, Anthony.

324
00:28:34,313 --> 00:28:37,693
I can't do it again, okay?
Babe, babe.

325
00:28:38,750 --> 00:28:40,250
They got nothing, all right?

326
00:28:42,721 --> 00:28:44,823
They ain't got shit.

327
00:28:44,824 --> 00:28:47,391
I'm getting outta
here soon. Trust me.

328
00:29:14,886 --> 00:29:16,187
Fucker!

329
00:29:16,188 --> 00:29:19,758
You get out, you don't even call me?
Jesus, Mike.

330
00:29:19,759 --> 00:29:21,960
Where the fuck did you come from?

331
00:29:21,961 --> 00:29:24,362
Good to see you.
FABIO: Hey! Hey!

332
00:29:24,363 --> 00:29:26,230
What're you doin'?

333
00:29:27,198 --> 00:29:28,867
Chitchat?

334
00:29:28,868 --> 00:29:31,936
We're paying you to chitchat? You wanna
chitchat, you go back to prison.

335
00:29:31,937 --> 00:29:34,997
You're paid to work, so get
a fuckin' move on! Okay?

336
00:29:42,781 --> 00:29:44,882
Let's just go back to work, okay?

337
00:29:58,029 --> 00:30:00,449
TOMMY: What the hell is goin' on?

338
00:30:24,455 --> 00:30:25,924
What do you wanna know?

339
00:30:25,925 --> 00:30:27,058
NATALIE: Please, don't be mad.

340
00:30:27,059 --> 00:30:30,428
I'm not mad.
I asked you a question.

341
00:30:30,429 --> 00:30:32,996
You wanna know what I did?
Why I went away?

342
00:30:33,998 --> 00:30:35,834
Yeah.

343
00:30:35,835 --> 00:30:37,969
I got 12 years for killing a guy.

344
00:30:37,970 --> 00:30:40,630
He raped and killed
a woman I was with.

345
00:30:43,374 --> 00:30:45,376
Listen, I spent most
of my fucking youth

346
00:30:45,377 --> 00:30:48,246
in correction houses and
prisons, that's who I am.

347
00:30:48,247 --> 00:30:49,587
You wanna leave, leave.

348
00:30:52,150 --> 00:30:56,988
The few times I've seen my
father, he was behind bars.

349
00:30:56,989 --> 00:31:00,190
But what I hated the most is
that he always lied to me.

350
00:31:02,493 --> 00:31:05,063
I'm not sure I can get past this.

351
00:31:05,064 --> 00:31:06,998
But if you want me to,
you gotta always be honest

352
00:31:06,999 --> 00:31:09,299
and you gotta tell me the truth.

353
00:31:11,202 --> 00:31:12,703
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

354
00:31:13,338 --> 00:31:14,973
Yep!

355
00:31:14,974 --> 00:31:16,754
Hey, Frank, there's a
woman here to see you.

356
00:31:17,575 --> 00:31:18,643
Oh, about what?

357
00:31:18,644 --> 00:31:20,344
She says it's private.

358
00:31:22,013 --> 00:31:24,614
Oh, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

359
00:31:33,057 --> 00:31:34,224
Hey.

360
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:39,964
Look, I'm... Uh, I'm sorry
about the other day.

361
00:31:39,965 --> 00:31:41,466
I don't want any trouble.

362
00:31:41,467 --> 00:31:42,567
Why, am I trouble right now?

363
00:31:42,568 --> 00:31:45,536
Please, Vanessa, I can't
really talk right now, okay?

364
00:31:45,537 --> 00:31:47,272
I'm working, all right?

365
00:31:47,273 --> 00:31:49,240
Oh, so you can come to my work
but I can't come to yours?

366
00:31:49,241 --> 00:31:50,675
Don't touch me.

367
00:31:50,676 --> 00:31:52,911
You want some help, Frank?

368
00:31:52,912 --> 00:31:53,777
No.

369
00:31:55,246 --> 00:31:57,148
(SIGHING)

370
00:31:57,149 --> 00:31:59,490
You wanna go for a drink?

371
00:32:03,254 --> 00:32:05,055
I'll be outside.

372
00:32:20,638 --> 00:32:22,173
You want something to drink?

373
00:32:22,174 --> 00:32:24,342
No. You locked up the wrong guy.

374
00:32:24,343 --> 00:32:25,410
Vanessa, listen to me.

375
00:32:25,411 --> 00:32:26,544
No, you listen to me.

376
00:32:26,545 --> 00:32:28,346
I wanna know one thing.

377
00:32:28,347 --> 00:32:29,580
Is it because of me
that you locked him up?

378
00:32:29,581 --> 00:32:31,082
Is it because of us?

379
00:32:31,083 --> 00:32:32,584
What are you talkin'...

380
00:32:32,683 --> 00:32:36,354
You know exactly
what I'm talking about!

381
00:32:36,355 --> 00:32:38,957
Do you think I could actually
do that even if I wanted to?

382
00:32:38,958 --> 00:32:40,992
Do you have any idea how much
evidence we got against him?

383
00:32:40,993 --> 00:32:42,592
No. You got nothing.

384
00:32:44,062 --> 00:32:46,497
You don't know Anthony.
He's a good man.

385
00:32:46,498 --> 00:32:49,067
Yes, he was trouble but
that's all in the past, okay?

386
00:32:49,068 --> 00:32:51,569
You have no idea what
this man has done for me,

387
00:32:51,570 --> 00:32:54,339
for my mother when she
was sick, for my family!

388
00:32:54,340 --> 00:32:56,240
When he got out,
he promised me that

389
00:32:56,241 --> 00:32:59,077
he was gonna stay clean
for me and for my kid.

390
00:32:59,078 --> 00:33:00,510
I understand.

391
00:33:01,646 --> 00:33:03,146
Some guys,

392
00:33:05,183 --> 00:33:07,763
they don't keep their promises.

393
00:33:08,753 --> 00:33:10,613
You're right, they don't.

394
00:33:20,631 --> 00:33:23,300
Where's the bathroom?
Straight back.

I'm not following you!

Just stop that!
Don't touch me!

- Just stop... Let me just...
- Don't touch me!

400
00:34:19,157 --> 00:34:21,259
I don't ever wanna
fucking see you again!

401
00:34:21,260 --> 00:34:23,694
You understand that?
You fucking left me...

402
00:34:23,695 --> 00:34:25,462
I... I didn't leave you!
You left me!

403
00:34:25,463 --> 00:34:28,599
I didn't understand myself, I was
stupid, all right? That's all!

404
00:34:28,700 --> 00:34:30,701
Why do you wanna fucking
come back into my life?

405
00:34:30,702 --> 00:34:32,770
You fucking screwed up once,

406
00:34:32,771 --> 00:34:35,306
and now you wanna fucking
take away the one fucking guy

407
00:34:35,307 --> 00:34:37,141

You don't fucking understand!

like every fucking year?

I wanna be with you.

I know him. I don't know them.

426

Guys from Philly.

427
00:37:12,429 --> 00:37:16,234
They started up three, four years
ago, doing girls and scores.

We've become friendly.

except they're having trouble
with some guys tipping the cops.

They need someone reliable, Chris.

432
00:37:25,010 --> 00:37:26,609
I could introduce you.

Well, I'm good.

But it's got potential. Just imagine,
hot dogs, french fries, drinks, huh?

447
00:39:01,639 --> 00:39:05,543
I just don't wanna go into
this by myself, Chris.

448
00:39:05,544 --> 00:39:07,645
So what do you say?
You interested?

to go into business together?

We don't need much.
What do we need, huh?

453
00:39:15,487 --> 00:39:17,521
A coat of paint?

454
00:39:17,522 --> 00:39:19,990

commissioner has to pick us. Right?

he recommends has a good shot.

we could call our own.

It's not our best
attribute, I know that.

But the mayor's looking for good
stories on his work release program.

Come on, give it a look.

00:39:42,146 --> 00:39:45,149
I mean, look at this.
It's pretty much built for us.

I mean fix this up a little,
throw a nail here.

know, "Mike, Chris, Chris."

Good, good.
Couldn't be better.

478
00:40:40,571 --> 00:40:42,939

You know it?

No.

That I stopped coming to visit you.

Just, you know...

485
00:41:17,142 --> 00:41:18,542
You know there was
all the shit that went down

486
00:41:18,543 --> 00:41:21,745
and I knew that...

487
00:41:21,746 --> 00:41:24,482
You having a cop brother was
going to be tough on the inside.

488
00:41:24,483 --> 00:41:26,617
Oh, so you did it for me.

489
00:41:26,618 --> 00:41:29,886
Not one visit
in nine fucking years

490
00:41:31,121 --> 00:41:33,157
but you did it for me?
Fuck you!

anything that I... that I...

I'm not sure that's such
a good idea, Frank.

What, is this
your personal opinion,

499
00:42:07,926 --> 00:42:10,895
or is this coming from higher up?

500
00:42:10,896 --> 00:42:15,232
Well your brother has a very loud

I'm not gonna turn my back on him

Mike you really did it, huh?

516
00:43:08,753 --> 00:43:10,220
Jeez.

517
00:43:10,221 --> 00:43:11,788

Well, great! Great job!

519
00:43:17,362 --> 00:43:20,331
Now, I know what I said, Mike,

520
00:43:20,332 --> 00:43:25,269
but unfortunately there's nothing
written down, right? So...

521
00:43:25,270 --> 00:43:28,806
How... How can you say that?
I mean, just like that?

I mean, I gave you my full support.

524
00:43:33,945 --> 00:43:36,180
So what's the problem?

525
00:43:36,181 --> 00:43:39,216
Well, the mayor's been getting
these anonymous letters.

526
00:43:39,217 --> 00:43:40,884
You know, and some of
his people have too,

527
00:43:40,885 --> 00:43:43,020
and, you know, they're
not too happy about it.

528
00:43:43,021 --> 00:43:46,323
Wait, wait. You knew about our records,
so did the commissioner, right?

529
00:43:46,324 --> 00:43:49,059
Yeah, right. But, this guy,

530
00:43:49,060 --> 00:43:50,995
you know, he's gonna make a
stink with the whole city.

531
00:43:50,996 --> 00:43:52,663
So, I mean,
what do you want with me?

00:43:52,664 --> 00:43:54,898
You said it was as good as done!
Yeah.

533
00:43:54,899 --> 00:43:56,367
That's what you said! Right?
Right! I did.

And I am very sorry.

But, you know, we got
an election comin' up

537
00:44:03,775 --> 00:44:05,409
and, the mayor, he's just...

538
00:44:05,410 --> 00:44:07,244
(STUTTERING) I mean
it's just too risky!

539
00:44:07,245 --> 00:44:09,380
Who sent the letters, do you know?

540
00:44:09,381 --> 00:44:12,082
There's no point even telling you.

541
00:44:12,083 --> 00:44:15,919
But if it's any consolation, Mike, that
guy's not gonna get the bid either...

So did you.

all together we gotta act like animals.

Lieutenant, I got some news.

954
01:14:11,781 --> 01:14:14,983
There's word about a van, parked
at a Warde's truck drop-off point

955
01:14:14,984 --> 01:14:17,686
at a bank in Flatbush,
since about a week.

956
01:14:17,687 --> 01:14:19,955
I've got a dry cleaner across the
street pointing surveillance.

957
01:14:19,956 --> 01:14:22,891
Seems to me that they're prepping
for a score. Maybe a big one.

958
01:14:22,892 --> 01:14:24,760
Alright, let everybody know.
We'll meet up in 10 minutes.

Frank, I want you in on this one.

961
01:14:31,701 --> 01:14:33,241
Don't go resign on me, all right?

962
01:14:33,969 --> 01:14:35,349
Have I ever let you down?

963

it's gonna happen today?

01:14:57,493 --> 01:14:59,194
You feel it?

966
01:14:59,195 --> 01:15:02,335
We're here 'cause you feel it?

How's that, you asshole?

01:15:08,003 --> 01:15:10,639
Okay, well, we'll see, I mean...

in a minute.

We'll see.

Okay, everybody stand by.
Truck's pulling on the set.

be on the exit so be ready.

not move until my command.

I'm gonna say that again, whatever
happens, nobody moves until my cue.
