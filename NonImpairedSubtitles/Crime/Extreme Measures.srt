Extreme Measures [1996]
Subtitles by SKAN

1
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:07,880
Teddy!

2
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:35,480
Shit, man! Get the fuck down!

3
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:41,000
It's them. Shit!

4
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:46,600
They follow me. You go the other way.
I'll try for the corner.

5
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:48,560
One of us will make it.

6
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:51,800
Listen to me.

7
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:54,240
You go and try to make it
back to The Room.

8
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:57,080
Wish me luck, brother.

9
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:59,680
It doesn't seem to be serious.
Just passed out from alcohol.

10
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:03,040
-Anyone been able to ID the guy?
-Nothing yet, Officer.

11
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:05,320
We'll get him cleaned up a little.

12
00:04:58,200 --> 00:04:59,520
I gotta go.

13
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:07,440
-Paul, I need you in here now.
-Right away.

14
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:11,480
What've we got?

15
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:14,640
32-year-old cop, multi-gunshots.
Right chest and leg.

16
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:16,720
-Vitals in the field?
-Stable.

17
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:17,840
Type of weapon?

18
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:19,000
Ask him.

19
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:20,360
He shot him.

20
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:23,200
Multi-shots also.
A crack pipe was in his pocket.

21
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:26,600
Let's get lines, pressure
and fluid back here, please.

22
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:30,400
I need two teams. Simon, he's yours.
Martin, Christina, over here.

23
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:32,200
I need you out of here now.

24
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:33,440
Do us a favor.

25
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:35,720
Father, you're too early, as ever.

26
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:39,560
Get him stable and upstairs. Jodie?

27
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:42,800
Call the ORs. I want two rooms
in about three minutes.

28
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:46,320
Hi, how you doing? My name's Dr. Luthan.

29
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:47,960
I'm the doctor in charge.

30
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:51,160
You've been shot but you're doing fine.
Mind if I look?

31
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:52,880
Let's take a little look.

32
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:57,120
It's not so bad. Do me a favor.
Take a deep breath when I say, '"Now.'"

33
00:05:57,400 --> 00:06:01,840
Jodie in Trauma. We've got two patients
with gunshots. We need two ORs.

34
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:03,520
Deep breath.

35
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:08,120
Great. No breath sounds on the right.
Get a chest tube...

36
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:10,800
...and rays here. Stat, Paula, stat.

37
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:13,640
-Got a name? Talk to me.
-Simon, how're we doing?

38
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:17,720
-A shot in the neck, one in the arm--
-And the wild look in your eye.

39
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:19,800
Let's relax. Same goes for everyone.

40
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:22,160
Including you. You've been doing crack?

41
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:23,880
Who the fuck are you?

42
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,560
You been doing heroin?
I need to know if I'm gonna help you.

43
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:29,560
I'll look at your arm.

44
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:34,440
Get a combine and pressure on that.

45
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,440
-How're we upstairs?
-Nothing yet.

46
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:37,840
Of course not. Stupid of me.

47
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:42,000
That's it. Right through there.

48
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:44,280
One room up. OR 3 standing by.

49
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:48,120
That's no good. I need two rooms.
Two patients need two rooms.

50
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:51,200
Motherfucker shot me.
He fucking shot me!

51
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:53,520
But you shot him first, didn't you?

52
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:56,800
Calm down. Help us out.
We're getting a urine sample.

53
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:58,080
Are we in?

54
00:06:58,640 --> 00:06:59,800
We're in.

55
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:03,280
-Good. Joel, do we have x-rays?
-Nothing yet.

56
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:05,280
-Where's Paula?
-Don't know.

57
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:07,800
Gentlemen, please? Thanks.

58
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:09,800
Doc, you remember me, right?

59
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:11,240
How's my guy?

60
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:13,840
Obviously he's been shot, so....
Excuse me.

61
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:15,400
He's got a family.

62
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:18,400
-Good. Point taken. Thank you.
-This is his wife.

63
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:24,880
Your husband will be okay. He'll be fine.

64
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:26,440
Thank you.

65
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,160
Talk to you later.

66
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:31,280
The other guy, go easy
on the painkillers, will you?

67
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:34,720
X-rays are good.
Let's get them both upstairs.

68
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:36,240
I can't shake another room.

69
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:38,720
They've just gotta open one, that's all.

70
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:40,640
They just did. They're full.

71
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:45,280
What's the move?

72
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:49,800
We got an expanding hematoma.
Pressure's dropping.

73
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:50,800
Joel?

74
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:54,480
BP's stable but we already lost a liter
through the chest tube.

75
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:04,520
Take the cop. Whole team goes with him.
This team stays with me.

76
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:09,160
Here, Daniel, you're gonna need this.

77
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:10,800
Jodie, tell them he's coming.

78
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:12,280
I need a basic tray set-up, sterile gloves.

79
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:16,120
I need to get him intubated
and I need light on this subject.

80
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:32,760
I wanted to thank you.
You did a great thing for my guy.

81
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:34,520
Listen, it's-- No, not you.

82
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:36,920
This is one hell of a doctor, I tell you.

83
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,800
She knows, she knows.

84
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:45,520
Good. Thank you very much then.
Thank you.

85
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:50,320
Tara, can you get Mrs. Gomez
up to the pulmonary unit? Excuse me.

86
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:52,480
-You need anything, call me.
-Will do.

87
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:54,080
-I owe you one.
-Sure.

88
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:56,480
Anytime. Name's Stone, as in Sharon.

89
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:07,600
Listen, they only gave me one room.

90
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:11,360
Yes, I know. But you knew
the other guy was in much worse shape.

91
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:13,720
-They'll both make it.
-You didn't know that.

92
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:14,920
I did.

93
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Look, you made a moral choice,
not a medical one. I guess I'm just....

94
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:21,800
-I'm surprised, that's all.
-Hang on. Wait.

95
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:26,080
This is New York. Gunshot wounds
aren't entirely unfamiliar to me.

96
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:28,760
My opinion was
that they were both stable.

97
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:31,800
I wanted two ORs, I didn't get them.
I had to choose.

98
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:36,800
On my right, I see a cop with his wife
in the hallway, and pictures of his kids.

99
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:39,320
On my left, a guy who pulled
a gun on a city bus.

100
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:43,160
I had ten seconds to make a choice.
I had to make it.

101
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:46,200
I hope I did the right thing. I think I did.

102
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:52,840
Oh, shit.

103
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,920
Maybe I didn't, I don't know.

104
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:59,200
Listen, I'm sorry. I'm just....

105
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:02,960
It's okay, it's okay.

106
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:06,040
You may well be right and I appreciate it.

107
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:09,600
I will resign first thing in the morning.

108
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:13,280
That's fair.

109
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:16,480
Good night.

110
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:20,120
Look, Jodie?

111
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:23,040
Are you doing second shift tomorrow?

112
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:24,400
Yeah, why?

113
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:26,320
Well, it's just I have to...

114
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:28,600
...get these intern evaluations done.

115
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:32,880
I'm supposed to get a nurse's input
and I was wondering if maybe I could...

116
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:34,800
-...get yours.
-Mine?

117
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:38,680
I was just thinking,
your critical faculties seem quite...

118
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:40,360
...sharp.

119
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:43,080
I'm sorry I got upset.
This week has been bad.

120
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:45,240
I know it's been bad. In fact...

121
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:47,400
...you're too busy. It's ridiculous.

122
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:49,840
I'll do it. It's fine. I'll do it.

123
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:52,880
Thanks.

124
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:53,880
Great.

125
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:06,600
Bobby, please go away.

126
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:08,560
I've got 16 patients out there.

127
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:11,600
I gave you a prescription
for pain meds yesterday.

128
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:14,040
I lost it. I got mugged.

129
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:16,360
How many times you get mugged a week?

130
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:18,920
Come on. I need some damn medication.

131
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:22,680
No, take the vitamins I gave you.
Try to exercise occasionally.

132
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:25,760
Sorry, but my membership
to the tennis club just expired.

133
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:28,680
Should I do dips
on the turnstiles in the subway?

134
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:31,640
You're not sick,
so I can't give you a prescription.

135
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:33,320
Okay? Give us a break.

136
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:36,400
Okay, sure. I can respect that.

137
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:38,040
-Appreciate it.
-Guy!

138
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:39,760
I need a consult. Urgent.

139
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:43,320
Excuse me, Doc. Are you an American?

140
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:45,800
Can I talk to you? Yo, bro!

141
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:50,720
Where was your ass at
when I got mugged the other night?

142
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:52,960
They picked him up passed out on Third.

143
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:56,080
Off the bus, he looked okay.
They left him ten minutes.

144
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:58,040
Hi there.

145
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:00,560
Jeez, he's really hot.

146
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:03,080
-What's this stuff?
-It's what he came in.

147
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:05,680
-Do we have a name for him?
-He won't talk.

148
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:08,160
Can you tell me your name, sir?

149
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:10,280
We started to work him up.
He looked sour.

150
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:11,960
We only left him ten minutes.

151
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:14,200
Can you tell me your name, sir?

152
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:18,200
Jesus! Hands, please!

153
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:20,000
Get him in the back room.

154
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:25,120
Oxygen. Joel, 10 of Valium.

155
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:28,160
You'll have to calm down for me.

156
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:31,520
Calm down. Simon, how's my EKG?
I need some numbers.

157
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:32,680
Any second.

158
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:36,200
-Valium's in.
-Hold the oxygen. We're getting him.

159
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:38,200
Can you hear me?

160
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:41,280
If you can hear me, it's very important--

161
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:46,000
Okay, Foley. How's my Foley?

162
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:47,040
We're already in.

163
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:51,560
Let's get a tox and let's get labs.
I want an ABG, I want a VDRL...

164
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:53,400
...I want a CBC, I want a--

165
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:56,560
Just get some serology tubes.
We'll work out what we want.

166
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:58,240
Can you run the bloods?

167
00:12:58,720 --> 00:12:59,920
Look at this.

168
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:00,960
On his wrist.

169
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:04,040
All right, so we've got
a hospital wristband.

170
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:06,000
Hold him. Hold him!

171
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:11,600
No name, no hospital.
Anyone seen one of these? Silver.

172
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:13,920
Pressure's 90 over palp and dropping.

173
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:15,600
Where's it going?

174
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:16,920
He could be septic.

175
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:21,640
Look at this.

176
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:26,240
He's post-op.
Recent surgical scarring, fresh tracks.

177
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:30,480
Possible IV, possible intravenous drug user.
Simon, how's it going?

178
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:32,480
180, 60, 120....

179
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:34,680
Fix the machine, for chrissake!

180
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:37,320
-Here's what I want.
-70 over palp, Guy.

181
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:42,320
Jesus, okay. Turn up the fluids.

182
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:44,800
Dopamine. Run at 500, now.

183
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:50,280
It's 240, 120. It's not the equipment.
I'm getting good tracings here.

184
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:55,480
Get the samples to the lab.

185
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:57,040
The tests you wanted--

186
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:59,120
I don't care. Get everything! Go!

187
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:00,720
Now it's going up, 180 over 100.

188
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:05,120
180? Back off on the....
Don't do that! Back off on the fluids.

189
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:09,400
-Cut the dopamine. We overshot here.
-The dopamine's not even in yet.

190
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:12,560
Come on guys, help me. Theories.

191
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:14,480
-What's happening?
-I don't know.

192
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:17,560
We're stabilizing.
I'm getting a normal sinus rhythm.

193
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:20,320
120 over 80.

194
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:23,000
-Did we do anything?
-It's holding.

195
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:24,480
80 and steady.

196
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:35,920
Think it's viral?

197
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:38,240
I hope not.

198
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:41,200
Could be.

199
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:44,720
Maybe there's a virologist
hiding here somewhere?

200
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:07,960
Hi. Can you hear me?

201
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:09,400
My name...

202
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:11,360
...Claude Minkins.

203
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:15,400
Good. Listen to me, Claude.
You're in Gramercy Hospital.

204
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:17,400
I've been here before.

205
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:19,080
You know what?

206
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:22,880
You had a hospital band on your wrist.
Where were you being treated?

207
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:27,200
You taking any drugs?
What medicine did they give you?

208
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:28,640
I don't know.

209
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:30,800
Triphase.

210
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:34,880
Whatever they put in you....

211
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:38,320
And what is Triphase? What is that?

212
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:40,760
Is it what they gave you where you were?

213
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:45,120
Tell Izzy I need a psych consult.

214
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:48,120
Then call the pharmacy,
find out what Triphase is.

215
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:50,000
Do you have epilepsy?

216
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:52,480
Stay with me. Do you have epilepsy?

217
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:54,360
Diabetes?

218
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:55,640
Asthma?

219
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:59,160
I'm trying to help you,
but you have to answer my questions.

220
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:02,320
-Who gave you this Triphase?
-Teddy Dolson.

221
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:06,000
He saved my life. The two of us.

222
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:08,160
Okay. But I need to--

223
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:09,680
You go to The Room.

224
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:12,400
You ask Teddy Dolson. He can tell you.

225
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:13,960
You go to The Room.

226
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:16,200
But listen, I'll go to The Room.

227
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:19,120
I'll talk to Teddy Dolson,
but at this moment--

228
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:22,320
Help me.

229
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:26,320
Please.

230
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:35,680
He's talking?

231
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:40,400
I'll help you.

232
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:43,640
I just don't want to give you something
to make you worse.

233
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:45,680
-Steady, steady.
-Hold him down!

234
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:47,240
Hands!

235
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:53,440
Valium. Hit him with another 20. Go.

236
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,240
They're on the line.

237
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:57,560
Jason, have you got him?

238
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:01,080
Got it.

239
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:05,680
I've got a patient who says he's
on Triphase. Did you ever hear of it?

240
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:08,400
No, no. Triphase with a '"T.'"

241
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:13,560
Could it be a street name
or something like that?

242
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:22,200
Start CPR. I need a milligram
of epinephrine now!

243
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:57,520
What'd you put on the death certificate?

244
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,280
Unknown.

245
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:02,960
Next of kin?

246
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:05,160
No. We don't have anything.

247
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:08,160
We'll let the medical examiner
worry about it.

248
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:15,360
Jeff, did you ever hear
of something called Triphase?

249
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:17,880
No. What is it?

250
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,960
It's this thing he said.

251
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:24,480
Why won't this new system
accept my security code?

252
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:29,240
I know I'm not supposed to say this,
but I could've screwed up somewhere.

253
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:32,200
Right. You shouldn't be saying it.

254
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:35,360
Maybe we should have someone
look it over.

255
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:36,520
Why?

256
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:40,280
Because I've never seen anything
like this in my life.

257
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,520
Maybe we should check
it's not something new.

258
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:50,600
What's new? He's homeless, cold,
stoned on God knows what, he dies.

259
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:54,120
It's more than that. You had to see it.

260
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:56,840
I've been here 800 years, Guy.
Believe me...

261
00:18:57,320 --> 00:18:58,680
...I've seen it.

262
00:18:58,760 --> 00:19:00,720
You look like shit, my friend.

263
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:02,240
Get some rest.

264
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:06,000
By the way, I heard about the NYU thing.

265
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:07,800
Congratulations.

266
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:38,360
Hi, Guy. It's me...

267
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:41,920
...ringing to congratulate you.
What do I have to do to catch up?

268
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:44,400
I'd like some of my money back, please.

269
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:48,760
Give me a ring. We're all very excited.
Dad keeps reading the paper.

270
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:53,040
Anyway, call me back.
And can you tell me what neurology is?

271
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:56,200
I don't know and I've got people
asking me about it.

272
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:58,040
Don't know why. Anyway...

273
00:19:58,120 --> 00:20:00,080
...give me a ring sometime, yeah?

274
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:03,720
I'm back in London.
Talk to you then. Soon. 'Bye.

275
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:07,160
Watching a rat running
on a treadmill might not be...

276
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:09,080
...everyone's idea of fun.

277
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:11,880
But to some American
and Swedish scientists...

278
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:15,440
...it'sjustification
for breaking out the champagne.

279
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:20,600
We were watching that.
Do me a favor. Get your grandpa.

280
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:22,880
After years of research....

281
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:29,320
Okay, listen up, everyone!

282
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:30,800
Listen up! Thank you.

283
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:35,040
As the only braggart in this family,
I won't let you leave this house...

284
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:37,400
...without hearing this telegram.

285
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:39,160
Stay where you are, Dad.

286
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:41,280
It's from the White House.

287
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:45,040
'"We were delighted you were awarded
the Wainwright Medal.

288
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:48,840
'"To have worked so long, so brilliantly,
with so little regard...

289
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:51,840

makes you a credit not only...

290

to your country. Many congratulations.

291

'"P.S. Any chance of a contribution to
my re-election campaign? I'm desperate.'"

292
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:10,840
You heard of this?

293
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:13,920
...nine hours after the separation
of the dorsal cortex...

294
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,080
...there was a significant, if temporary...

295
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:18,040
...recovery in voluntary mobility.

296
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:20,680
-Extraordinary.
-Scientists remain cautious.

297
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:23,480
The world's rat population
will be overjoyed.

298
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:28,640
Where's those darn cartoons?

299
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:39,560
This is so nice of you.

300
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:40,920
I got you a baklava.

301
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,200
Thank you.

302
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:44,440
-Ready for some coffee?
-Sure.

303
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:46,560
Jimmy, can I have another coffee?

304
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:48,760
Jesus, how many have you gotta do?

305
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:50,000
128.

306
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:51,920
How many have you done?

307
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:53,480
I've done three.

308
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:55,160
When are they due?

309
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:01,320
-Cassmore will be a pretty good doctor.
-Great. Exactly.

310
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:04,280
That's exactly what I had.
Thank you. Berringer.

311
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:07,320
I think he'll be a shockingly bad doctor.

312
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:10,120
-Isn't that a bit harsh?
-No.

313
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:13,680
You're right. He's lethal.

314
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:17,040
I'll give him '"fair.'"
I don't wanna go any lower than that.

315
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:18,680
And Myzerra?

316
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:21,080
-The nurses like him.
-He's good, isn't he?

317
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:24,000
I don't know about good,
but he's extremely sexy.

318
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:26,280
Right.

319
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:30,360
He was on '"good.'"
Now, sadly, he's on '"unsatisfactory.'"

320
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:35,080
FBI?

321
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:37,080
Agent Hare.

322
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:39,760
What can I do for you?

323
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:43,280
First of all, this has to be on the q.t.

324
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:46,720
-Is that something you can handle?
-Sure. No problem.

325
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:51,760
You seen this gentleman around?

326
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:53,720
His name is Teddy Dolson.

327
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:56,800
I don't know.

328
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:00,520
I mean, take a look.

329
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:09,000
I could put the picture up.
Ask around. See if anybody's seen him.

330
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:10,920
That could be damaging.

331
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:13,200
Mind if I look around?

332
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:15,600
Sure. Whatever you say.

333
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:24,160
How do you know this? I can't even
put faces to half these names.

334
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:28,160
I don't know. I talk to people, I suppose.
Plus, I see their files.

335
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:30,040
You what?

336
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:32,080
Rostering. It's okay.

337
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:36,440
Have you seen mine?

338
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:41,960
You just got your fellowship at NYU.
In two months you won't talk to any of us.

339
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:45,560
Yeah, dead right on both counts.
Anything else?

340
00:23:46,280 --> 00:23:47,840
Your dad's a doctor.

341
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:48,880
Right.

342
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,520
'"Was,'" actually. He retired.

343
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:56,400
And your family? Are they medical?

344
00:23:56,920 --> 00:23:58,160
Not really.

345
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:01,720
A lot of hypochondriacs,
but that's not quite the same.

346
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:09,760
Did the file say my dad
had his license revoked?

347
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:12,760
I'm sorry. I'm such an idiot.

348
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:14,480
No, that's fine.

349
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:16,280
I'm sorry.

350
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:23,880
I'll put you out of your misery. He....

351
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:28,640
Well, that is exactly what he did, in fact.

352
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:32,640
For a very old friend in a lot of pain
with terminal lymph cancer.

353
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:38,480
Where do you stand on that one?

354
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:40,080
I don't know.

355
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:44,920
Nor do I.

356
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:51,600
-Can I get you another baklava?
-No, thank you.

357
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:55,640
Sorry. Maybe next time we can go
somewhere with better food.

358
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:58,120
That would be anywhere in New York.

359
00:24:58,200 --> 00:24:59,600
Yes, it would.

360
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:02,640
We should probably go, right?

361
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:04,160
Yeah, absolutely.

362
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:06,600
Listen, you go. I'll clear all this up.

363
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:08,600
Thanks for doing this.

364
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:10,520
Thank you for the coffee.

365
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:12,480
-Right. Coffee.
-See you there.

366
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,360
-Jimmy, can I get the check?
-Sure.

367
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:18,720
Thanks.

368
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:23,560
Sorry. Hang on.

369
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:26,400
Got it.

370
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:27,760
There you go.

371
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:47,160
Who the hell is Claude Minkins?

372
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:52,720
It's '"was,'" I'm afraid. He died.

373
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:54,720
Tell me he had insurance.

374
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:56,600
That's not at all likely.

375
00:25:56,680 --> 00:26:00,040
This is $2,600 worth of lab work.

376
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:02,400
Right. Can I--

377
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:05,120
I had two people tied up for eight hours.

378
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:08,920
What you do in your own home
is your business.

379
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:10,840
Let's get it into your head.

380
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:13,760
This is not England,
or the Royal Shakespeare...

381
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:16,240
...Taxpayer-Pick-Up-The-Tab
Health Care System.

382
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:18,600
Somebody has to pay for this shit.

383
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:21,720
Sorry.

384
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:29,600
He's got liver damage, but no hepatitis.
He's HIV-negative...

385
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:31,560
...but look at his T cell count.

386
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:34,920
-He's negative viral and bacterial--
-What is that?

387
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,440
I don't know.
She probably just got her bill.

388
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:39,120
Please help.

389
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:42,400
Does this make sense to you? Take a look.

390
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:45,600
If I tell you what I think,
will you take the screamer?

391
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:48,960
Very sick dude. Very funny labs.
Catch you later.

392
00:26:55,320 --> 00:26:59,080
I do. I'm sorry. I realize it is very late.
I apologize.

393
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:01,240
Could you just answer me one thing?

394
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:04,520
Does your hospital use
a silver-colored bracelet?

395
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:06,600
Okay, terrific.

396
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:11,040
You don't know any hospital or anything
that does use something like that?

397
00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:16,200
Thank you. I apologize again.
Thank you very much.

398
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:18,960
-Move, please!
-Your rays are back.

399
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:22,480
-Thanks. In a minute.
-Someone gonna move Mrs. Gardner?

400
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:24,840
Guy, Line 6.

401
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:27,280
Thanks. Excuse me.

402
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:31,360
Thanks very much for calling back.

403
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:35,800
I'm looking for an autopsy report
on a patient called Claude Minkins.

404
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:38,880
It would be early hours
of yesterday morning.

405
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:41,880
Just looking for a cause of death.

406
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:43,600
I'll hold, thanks.

407
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,520
And that's it?

408
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:51,720
That's all you have?

409
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:53,640
Just pulmonary embolism?

410
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:58,720
He'd obviously been in a hospital.
I wouldn't rule it out as a symptom....

411
00:27:59,080 --> 00:28:00,720
Someone get the gurney!

412
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:05,280
I have his lab report and frankly,
it's completely beyond belief.

413
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:07,680
We have a burn coming off the bus.

414
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:11,920
All right. No, forget it. Forget it.

415
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:14,760
No, really, thank you. I have to go.

416
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:17,760
I understand.
Thank you very much for calling back.

417
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:29,520
Did he bite?

418
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:32,920
One down, one to go.

419
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:35,400
How we doing on Dolson?

420
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:40,800
-We've been through a dozen shelters.
-Fourteen. Plus the hospitals.

421
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:44,120
We're making runs through
Grand Central twice a day.

422
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:46,640
Okay. Keep pushing.

423
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:50,840
I guess we're looking
for a body by now, but....

424
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:55,560
He's still alive.

425
00:28:57,840 --> 00:28:59,880
He'll be needing medication.

426
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:02,040
I'll make out a list.

427
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:27,200
Perhaps you're mistaken?

428
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:31,320
I don't see how that's possible.

429
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:33,160
With whom did you speak?

430
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:36,600
I didn't get a name.
Someone here who called me back.

431
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,640
At 1:00 in the morning.

432
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:42,280
Gave you a cause of death,
which you didn't believe.

433
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:44,960
It just didn't make much sense.

434
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:46,600
I can see that.

435
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:49,160
I have no record of this man.

436
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:54,320
I think, in fact, you have.
If you could take another look.

437
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:57,040
It's Minkins. M-I-N-K-I-N-S.

438
00:29:57,520 --> 00:29:59,200
Pulmonary embolism.

439
00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:01,560
I have no record of this man.

440
00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:05,200
Sorry. Who's actually in charge here then?

441
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:08,200
That would be me.

442
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:11,560
I've been here since midnight
and I made no such calls.

443
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:16,040
Okay, so let me just get this straight:

444
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:20,000
No one phoned me,
so that was my imagination running riot...

445
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:24,320
...and you've no record of a patient
of mine who died 24 hours ago.

446
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:27,800
Your hospital's known for losing patients.

447
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:29,720
Living and dead.

448
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:32,640
What did you say?

449
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:34,800
What did you say?

450
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:39,760
You're quite a creepy person.

451
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:43,440
Before, I thought you were obstructive
or inept.

452
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:46,080
But now I think you're much more sinister.

453
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:48,760
I think you better leave.

454
00:30:50,120 --> 00:30:52,720
-You lying about this?
-Everything okay?

455
00:30:55,640 --> 00:30:57,120
Yeah, thanks.

456
00:30:58,040 --> 00:31:01,960
Here, I'm just off. You can pop
your boss back in his drawer now.

457
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,680
Apparently, you were threatening
and abusive.

458
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:09,520
For God's sake.
I mean, that's just ridiculous.

459
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:12,800
I was mildly sarcastic,
but under the circumstances...

460
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:14,800
...I was astonishingly restrained.

461
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:18,280
The doctor you spoke to needed protection
from an orderly.

462
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:21,240
That is just a lie. Who told you that?

463
00:31:21,320 --> 00:31:23,200
The chief medical examiner.

464
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:28,240
-This is starting to sound really weird.
-Get me the charts and go home.

465
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:31,000
What about the body?

466
00:31:31,080 --> 00:31:33,680
They have no receipt on Claude Minkins.

467
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:34,960
Who called me?

468
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:36,480
Who? Give me a name.

469
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:39,440
I didn't get a name. I was busy.

470
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:41,440
Isn't this a little strange?

471
00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:43,960
'"A little strange'"? It sounds a lot strange.

472
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:47,240
I did not threaten or be abusive to anyone.

473
00:31:47,320 --> 00:31:48,880
Then my apology was unnecessary.

474
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:52,080
This whole thing has to be connected.
You saw the report.

475
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:56,400
The guy had a metabolic meltdown.
He had a total failure in every system.

476
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:58,200
Ever see numbers like that?

477
00:31:58,280 --> 00:32:00,480
Of course not. The report's a joke.

478
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:04,200
All it proves is our lab is even more fucked
than people say.

479
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:08,160
-Then what about the wristband?
-What about it?

480
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:10,360
Jeff, I'm not trying to be annoying.

481
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:13,400
A man died on my table,
and I have no idea why.

482
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:16,480
This is a repair shop.
We're not here to do research.

483
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:21,080
I got 100,000 crises a year in here
and I have a responsibility to each one.

484
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:25,240
-I've heard the repair-shop speech.
-Let me put it to you this way.

485
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:28,120
I'm your boss and I'm telling you...

486
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:30,240
...drop this thing.

487
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:37,040
Now go home and go to bed.

488
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:47,520
-Judith. How are you?
-I'm great. How's it going?

489
00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:50,360
Good. Yeah. Terrific, thanks.

490
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:52,440
You don't sound convinced.

491
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:57,400
No, I'm horribly aware you've come
to ask about the intern evaluations.

492
00:32:57,480 --> 00:32:58,720
How behind are you?

493
00:32:58,800 --> 00:33:01,640
-I did do a few the other day.
-How behind are you?

494
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:05,040
-Criminally.
-I could pretend I haven't seen you.

495
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:07,600
Judith, that would be incredibly kind.

496
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:10,400
-Thanks.
-If you play for the residents.

497
00:33:11,160 --> 00:33:14,000
No, not basketball.
I don't even know the rules.

498
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:16,800
We'll explain them. It's for a great cause.

499
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:25,200
Where am I?

500
00:33:25,320 --> 00:33:28,280
I'm your doctor, Mr. Randall.
You're in the hospital.

501
00:33:28,360 --> 00:33:29,440
Am I okay?

502
00:33:29,520 --> 00:33:31,920
So far everything looks pretty good.

503
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:35,080
Where are my clothes? My stuff?

504
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:37,280
They're outside. They're safe.

505
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:40,200
I was in the park.

506
00:33:40,520 --> 00:33:42,800
It must be pretty confusing, huh?

507
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:48,360
We were wondering, is there anybody
you'd like us to contact? Any family?

508
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:50,040
My daughter, but....

509
00:33:50,120 --> 00:33:51,960
When did you see her last?

510
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:56,000
Not since 1978.

511
00:33:56,520 --> 00:33:57,680
When her mother died.

512
00:33:57,760 --> 00:34:01,880
I see. Anybody else you'd like us
to get in touch with?

513
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:06,360
No, I'm pretty much on my own now.
Thank you.

514
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:10,520
Could you stand up for me?

515
00:34:11,080 --> 00:34:13,000
Forgive me for asking...

516
00:34:13,160 --> 00:34:16,040
...but I need to ask you
a couple of questions.

517
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:19,080
-What is, say, six times four?
-Excuse me.

518
00:34:19,160 --> 00:34:22,680
I was wondering, do you suppose
I could get something to eat?

519
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:25,320
Absolutely.

520
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:28,960
-Why don't we do that right now.
-Thanks. I'd appreciate it.

521
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:31,280
It's 24, by the way.

522
00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:34,920
The answer to your question.

523
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:38,440
I was a schoolteacher for 18 years.

524
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:49,320
Minkins, Claude. He was here last year.

525
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:51,400
He was an ER walk-in.

526
00:34:51,640 --> 00:34:53,440
Fractured carpal.

527
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:56,440
What's that? Ankle?

528
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:58,240
No, it's a wrist.

529
00:34:58,600 --> 00:35:02,560
Let's see. Phone number: 212-000-0000.

530
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:05,120
-That means he's homeless.
-Next of kin?

531
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:07,360
-No.
-None. Thanks, Pat.

532
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:12,320
But he's got an outstanding
balance of $981.

533
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:16,720
What, for x-rays?

534
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:19,520
Let's see.

535
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:23,320
Radiology was $289, and then the lab work.

536
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:27,120
His bloodwork was another $500.

537
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:30,920
Why the hell is he having bloodwork
when he had a broken wrist?

538
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:32,640
We'll tell you.

539
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:36,680
Looks like it's been dumped.

540
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:37,920
Meaning?

541
00:35:38,080 --> 00:35:40,160
It's the system. It sucks.

542
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:42,760
There's not enough storage,
so every month...

543
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:45,400
...they have to pull stuff down
to make room.

544
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:48,000
And would there be a hard copy
or whatever?

545
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:50,640
You could try the Records Annex...

546
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:54,160
...but it'll take you a million years
to get clearance.

547
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:57,680
I'll tell you what.
Can you do another one for me?

548
00:35:57,800 --> 00:36:00,040
Dolson, Teddy. Please?

549
00:36:00,120 --> 00:36:04,560
All right. I'll do Dolson. Dolson for you.

550
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:07,120
Dolson, Theodore.

551
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:10,880
Undomiciled, conjunctivitis, no next of kin.

552
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:12,680
Another deadbeat.

553
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:17,040
Outstanding balance, $645.80.

554
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:19,160
This is for lab work too?

555
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:21,360
Yep. Bloodwork.

556
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:23,280
For conjunctivitis?

557
00:36:23,720 --> 00:36:25,520
I guess not. Let's see.

558
00:36:25,640 --> 00:36:27,160
Details.

559
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:31,560
You sure know how to pick them.

560
00:36:31,640 --> 00:36:36,000
I mean, we have been bitching
about this system since they put it in.

561
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:39,720
Let me get this straight.
You're saying someone...

562
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:41,840
...has deleted all this stuff?

563
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:43,960
What? You mean on purpose?

564
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:11,440
What the hell are you doing?

565
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:22,440
I'm looking for the file on Minkins.

566
00:37:22,520 --> 00:37:25,400
He was here before.
Someone tampered with his record.

567
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,800
Anyone see you come in?

568
00:37:32,120 --> 00:37:33,480
Look, Jeff.

569
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:36,760
There are so many things
about this which are so odd.

570
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:38,960
Would you include your recent self?

571
00:37:41,480 --> 00:37:42,720
You nailed a fellowship.

572
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:46,280
You're two months away.
You're going to places I could never get to.

573
00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:52,160
Anyone finds you in here,
and you aren't going anywhere.

574
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:57,240
So relax, okay?

575
00:37:58,160 --> 00:38:00,080
By the way, your mystery man?

576
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:02,760
I called security. They're looking into it.

577
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:05,520
Okay? Now, come on. Come on.

578
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:11,080
I was fighting my ass off like a gladiator.

579
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:13,560
He didn't have a knife, he had a machete.

580
00:38:13,640 --> 00:38:17,120
Did I say six inches?
Fourteen inches long. No lie, man.

581
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:20,120
The motherfuckers took my scrips and all.

582
00:38:21,080 --> 00:38:24,000
Wait a minute,
what kind of stitching you call that?

583
00:38:24,080 --> 00:38:25,360
It's good. It's fine.

584
00:38:25,480 --> 00:38:27,680
Bullshit. I'm homeless, not stupid.

585
00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:31,120
It looks like the Bride of Frankenstein.
Tell him.

586
00:38:31,240 --> 00:38:34,280
Those are terrible sutures.
You're a terrible suturer.

587
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:35,560
See?

588
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:37,920
I'm gonna make you all happy.

589
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,000
-Jack, can you finish this up?
-Sure.

590
00:38:42,040 --> 00:38:43,920
Good. And what's next?

591
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:47,040
Don't you have
that important reception at NYU?

592
00:38:48,920 --> 00:38:50,160
Jesus Christ!

593
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:52,840
Where you going? I'm in serious pain here.

594
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:56,280
And this motherfucker's 12 years old!

595
00:39:00,120 --> 00:39:01,720
Anyhow, my apologies again.

596
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:04,800
It's not a problem.
You've met the rest of the team?

597
00:39:05,480 --> 00:39:07,440
I think so. At the interview.

598
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:10,520
-Dr. Sharma.
-Nice seeing you again, Doctor.

599
00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:12,080
-Very nice to see you.
-Thank you.

600
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:13,240
Dr. Cohen.

601
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:15,080
-Good to see you.
-How are you?

602
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:18,240
-Dr. Breceski.
-Welcome to neurology.

603
00:39:18,760 --> 00:39:21,040
And do you know Professor Myrick?

604
00:39:22,040 --> 00:39:24,160
Who has nothing to do with this program...

605
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:26,800
...but was here and wanted to say hello.

606
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:31,320
You took care of a neighbor's son.
A cab accident.

607
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:33,400
They said you were terrific.

608
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:37,560
Anyhow, I heard you'd be here
and I just wanted to pass that on.

609
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:39,800
Thank you, it's a great honor.

610
00:39:39,880 --> 00:39:41,240
So you're moving on?

611
00:39:41,320 --> 00:39:43,760
That's right. I start here in the summer.

612
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:45,480
Well, that's great.

613
00:39:45,600 --> 00:39:48,000
If you think that ER was tough...

614
00:39:48,080 --> 00:39:50,400
...wait till Jim gets started with you.

615
00:39:50,520 --> 00:39:51,880
Right, Jim?

616
00:39:52,840 --> 00:39:54,280
Dr. Myrick?

617
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:01,680
I probably shouldn't,
but can I ask you a question?

618
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:05,560
Certainly.

619
00:40:09,360 --> 00:40:11,280
Okay, basically...

620
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:13,640
...white male, forties.

621
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:16,160
Elevated thyroid functions.

622
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:18,840
Enzyme toxicity just off the charts.

623
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:21,840
Convulsions, high fever...

624
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,360
...pulse, pressure and vitals
in total disarray.

625
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:27,160
Who are we talking about?

626
00:40:27,640 --> 00:40:29,480
It's just a patient of mine.

627
00:40:31,560 --> 00:40:34,760
You'd have to rule out meningitis.
Did you do a spinal tap?

628
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:36,760
Oh, no, he died on us.

629
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:39,840
What about postmortem?

630
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:45,120
Believe it or not, we've lost the body.

631
00:40:46,680 --> 00:40:48,440
Well, that never helps.

632
00:40:50,760 --> 00:40:53,360
Bottom line, without a tap,
you'll never know.

633
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:01,160
That's what I thought.

634
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:04,280
Thank you very much.

635
00:41:05,360 --> 00:41:06,400
Sure.

636
00:41:10,320 --> 00:41:12,080
I guess I was a big help.

637
00:41:18,120 --> 00:41:19,160
So?

638
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:21,240
He's not gonna drop it.

639
00:41:40,680 --> 00:41:42,120
I'm headed out.

640
00:41:48,680 --> 00:41:50,200
I'll see you later.

641
00:41:51,880 --> 00:41:53,920
She's eating very well this morning.

642
00:42:24,920 --> 00:42:26,800
How you doing?

643
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:31,160
-You take care of your shift?
-My partner's gonna cover for me.

644
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:34,760
So what's this guy's name?

645
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:36,200
Luthan.

646
00:42:37,480 --> 00:42:39,680
Dr. Guy Luthan.

647
00:42:43,040 --> 00:42:44,920
You're okay on this, right?

648
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:48,040
It's not gonna go in my memoirs.

649
00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:57,280
You can't handle this...

650
00:42:57,360 --> 00:42:59,120
...you better tell me now.

651
00:42:59,960 --> 00:43:02,040
Look, I'm in, okay?

652
00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:07,600
I'm in.

653
00:43:22,320 --> 00:43:24,160
My ears are ringing.

654
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:28,880
Could youjust raise your right hand
and your left leg for me, please?

655
00:43:31,320 --> 00:43:33,040
You don't hear it?

656
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:38,400
In a moment, Mr. Randall,
then we'll get you right back to bed.

657
00:43:43,320 --> 00:43:46,640
This is Observation Room B.
We need help, stat.

658
00:43:48,280 --> 00:43:49,120
You...

659
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:50,880
...gotta stop...

660
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:52,120
...it!

661
00:43:53,640 --> 00:43:55,800
This tape was filmed 22 hours...

662
00:43:55,920 --> 00:43:58,800
...after the removal
of a 4-micron spinal section...

663
00:43:58,880 --> 00:44:00,520
...at the tenth vertebra.

664
00:44:00,600 --> 00:44:02,560
Insertion of an electrical prosthetic--

665
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:03,720
Was followed by...

666
00:44:03,800 --> 00:44:07,880
...administration of
I.N. 1 monoclonal antibody and so on.

667
00:44:08,160 --> 00:44:09,840
Patient Number 12...

668
00:44:09,960 --> 00:44:13,760
...regained 75 percent operational mobility.

669
00:44:14,040 --> 00:44:18,320
And 26 hours and 14 minutes
after his operation...

670
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:20,360
...his condition is stable.

671
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:27,760
Take it easy, guys. We're not there yet,
but we are getting closer.

672
00:44:27,880 --> 00:44:30,120
Those who've been here
from the beginning...

673
00:44:30,200 --> 00:44:31,840
...Helen and Billy...

674
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:34,720
...and can remember Patient 1,
know how far we've come.

675
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:38,280
Don't go wild, but your work,
your suffering...

676
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:40,920
...your sacrifices will certainly be worth it.

677
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:43,120
And like I said...

678
00:44:43,240 --> 00:44:44,680
...we're not there yet...

679
00:44:44,760 --> 00:44:46,960
...but we certainly will be there.

680
00:44:47,080 --> 00:44:48,680
Thank you so much.

681
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:56,240
Literally hundreds of dollars worth...

682
00:44:56,320 --> 00:44:59,200
...of unnecessary lab work
wiped off the computer.

683
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:01,960
And Jeff has access to that computer.

684
00:45:02,040 --> 00:45:04,440
So I go to the Records Annex to look....

685
00:45:04,520 --> 00:45:08,800
I shouldn't be there. To see if there's
a hard copy of details of this lab work.

686
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:10,400
And there's Jeff again.

687
00:45:10,480 --> 00:45:14,080
This time, making pretty unsubtle threats
about my future...

688
00:45:14,160 --> 00:45:15,800
...if I don't drop it.

689
00:45:16,920 --> 00:45:20,680
What do we do? I have no idea
what they're trying to cover up.

690
00:45:20,920 --> 00:45:23,600
But maybe there's something
we should be doing.

691
00:45:24,200 --> 00:45:26,320
This isn't what Jeff told me.

692
00:45:27,560 --> 00:45:30,640
-You spoke to him?
-You're pulling over 90 hours a week.

693
00:45:30,840 --> 00:45:33,520
I looked it up. It's too much.
People burn out.

694
00:45:33,760 --> 00:45:35,160
I'm not overworked.

695
00:45:35,240 --> 00:45:37,680
I brought you over. I'm your biggest fan.

696
00:45:39,480 --> 00:45:42,440
Jeff may not be a great boss,
but I trust him.

697
00:45:42,520 --> 00:45:44,440
Exactly what I'd have said three days--

698
00:45:44,560 --> 00:45:48,560
When you accuse him of conspiracy,
you start to sound a little odd.

699
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:50,880
Yeah, well, okay. All right.

700
00:45:51,640 --> 00:45:54,320
There's no question I am tired.
That's for sure.

701
00:45:54,400 --> 00:45:55,920
But I promise you...

702
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:58,520
...I'm not cracking up.
I tell you what I'll do.

703
00:45:58,600 --> 00:46:01,800
I'll get you a copy of the original lab work
on Minkins--

704
00:46:01,920 --> 00:46:04,080
Shut the fuck up!

705
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:06,240
I'm really sorry.

706
00:46:06,320 --> 00:46:07,560
I apologize.

707
00:46:08,120 --> 00:46:10,400
I seriously think you should look at it.

708
00:46:17,480 --> 00:46:19,440
The cops, they call you, yes?

709
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:22,960
-They still here?
-This morning I hear something breaking.

710
00:46:23,040 --> 00:46:25,400
I call 91 1 right away.

711
00:46:28,600 --> 00:46:30,040
Guy Luthan?

712
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:38,480
You're Dr. Luthan?

713
00:46:40,360 --> 00:46:42,120
I'm Detective Manning.

714
00:46:42,240 --> 00:46:43,840
Sorry about this.

715
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:50,280
Fuck!

716
00:46:52,440 --> 00:46:53,560
Fuck!

717
00:46:57,320 --> 00:46:59,680
So, did they just break the door down?

718
00:46:59,760 --> 00:47:01,600
Looks that way, yeah.

719
00:47:02,920 --> 00:47:05,880
We called. We figured you worked...

720
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:07,840
...at Gramercy.

721
00:47:08,520 --> 00:47:12,120
The responding officers, they got here,
the door was wide open.

722
00:47:12,680 --> 00:47:14,160
So anyone see anything?

723
00:47:14,240 --> 00:47:16,160
You mean a witness? No.

724
00:47:16,880 --> 00:47:18,760
You look a little punchy.

725
00:47:22,080 --> 00:47:23,640
Anything missing?

726
00:47:24,280 --> 00:47:25,720
I don't know.

727
00:47:27,120 --> 00:47:29,040
Like I said...

728
00:47:29,320 --> 00:47:30,760
...the door was open.

729
00:47:30,840 --> 00:47:32,880
It's legal for us to look around.

730
00:47:36,040 --> 00:47:37,560
What do you mean?

731
00:47:39,520 --> 00:47:41,800
You talking about the hospital stuff?

732
00:47:42,280 --> 00:47:46,320
I've been at Gramercy for two years.
All of this was being thrown out.

733
00:47:46,480 --> 00:47:48,960
You mean, the towels and shit, right?

734
00:47:49,080 --> 00:47:50,800
Finders keepers, right?

735
00:47:52,640 --> 00:47:54,360
I thought you'd arrest me.

736
00:47:54,480 --> 00:47:59,040
I am concerned about the half ounce
of pharmaceutical cocaine we found.

737
00:48:05,320 --> 00:48:07,000
It was next to your bed.

738
00:48:10,680 --> 00:48:13,040
Do you share this apartment with anyone?

739
00:48:14,800 --> 00:48:15,800
No.

740
00:48:16,160 --> 00:48:18,400
I have to place you under arrest.

741
00:48:20,520 --> 00:48:22,320
'"You have the right to remain silent.

742
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:25,920
'"Anything you say can
and will be used against you.'"

743
00:48:26,120 --> 00:48:28,160
Something's going on here.

744
00:48:29,360 --> 00:48:32,480
'"If you cannot afford one,
one will be appointed to you.'"

745
00:48:34,520 --> 00:48:35,960
Watch your head.

746
00:48:57,760 --> 00:48:59,480
While investigating a burglary...

747
00:48:59,560 --> 00:49:03,040
...at the defendant's apartment,
police discovered in plain view...

748
00:49:03,120 --> 00:49:06,080
...approximately 18 grams of pure cocaine.

749
00:49:07,200 --> 00:49:11,160
The state has charges pending
concerning theft of property...

750
00:49:11,240 --> 00:49:14,640
-...from the defendant's employer.
-I don't do pending, Counselor.

751
00:49:14,720 --> 00:49:16,240
Talk to me about bail.

752
00:49:16,440 --> 00:49:18,120
We think there's a risk of flight.

753
00:49:18,200 --> 00:49:19,880
We're asking for $10,000 bond...

754
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:22,040
...and we'd like his passport.

755
00:49:23,080 --> 00:49:24,360
Look, I can help you.

756
00:49:24,480 --> 00:49:26,160
I'm $125 an hour.

757
00:49:26,240 --> 00:49:29,080
It was a bad search. It was a first offense.

758
00:49:29,280 --> 00:49:32,760
For $1,500, we could plead this out,
suspended sentence.

759
00:49:34,920 --> 00:49:36,960
Excuse me, where you going?

760
00:49:37,040 --> 00:49:38,440
I'm trying to help you!

761
00:49:44,960 --> 00:49:49,200
This is Guy. Ifyou have a message,
leave it after the beep. Thanks.

762
00:49:49,280 --> 00:49:51,040
Guy, it's Dad.

763
00:49:51,240 --> 00:49:54,160
I'm sorry to keep ringing,
I want to say two things:

764
00:49:54,280 --> 00:49:58,120
One: it turns out I actually knew
your NYU chap, Coseeki.

765
00:49:58,240 --> 00:50:00,360
At the Royal Marston, back in the fifties.

766
00:50:00,440 --> 00:50:01,880
And two:

767
00:50:02,120 --> 00:50:06,360
I thought I might fly over to buy
you a congratulatory Tom Collins...

768
00:50:06,440 --> 00:50:08,720
...or whatever they drink over there.

769
00:50:08,800 --> 00:50:10,760
Possibly later this month?

770
00:50:10,880 --> 00:50:13,720
Let me know what you think, okay? 'Bye.

771
00:50:18,240 --> 00:50:21,640
''Pending the outcome of
your criminal trial, Gramercy Hospital...

772
00:50:21,720 --> 00:50:24,920
'"...will agree to suspend charges
on the stolen property.

773
00:50:25,160 --> 00:50:29,040
'"As of today, you are relieved
of all hospital duties and credentials.

774
00:50:29,200 --> 00:50:32,280
'"The contents of your call room
will be forwarded to you.

775
00:50:32,600 --> 00:50:36,520
'"Your presence on the property
without invitation will constitute trespass.

776
00:50:37,320 --> 00:50:42,200
'"We've notified Immigration we'll revoke
sponsorship of your work visa...

777
00:50:42,520 --> 00:50:45,400
'"...should criminal charges
result in conviction.'"

778
00:50:49,480 --> 00:50:51,120
Well, that was quick.

779
00:50:53,320 --> 00:50:57,120
All that in 24 hours. Taken me longer
to find a bed for a patient.

780
00:50:58,040 --> 00:51:00,400
It's best to move fast on these things.

781
00:51:00,520 --> 00:51:02,760
It's not the first time this has happened.

782
00:51:04,080 --> 00:51:05,520
Is that right?

783
00:51:07,320 --> 00:51:09,280
That might explain it a bit...

784
00:51:09,400 --> 00:51:12,360
...because obviously, I'm having
trouble understanding why...

785
00:51:12,440 --> 00:51:16,200
...it's so easy for all of you to believe
I just threw my life away...

786
00:51:17,720 --> 00:51:20,160
...which was going quite well.
Why I suddenly...

787
00:51:20,280 --> 00:51:23,240
...out of the blue, took up drugs
and threw it all away.

788
00:51:23,320 --> 00:51:26,840
It's hard to grasp why that's easier
for you to believe...

789
00:51:27,120 --> 00:51:30,840
...than that someone in this hospital
set me up to stop me asking...

790
00:51:30,920 --> 00:51:34,240
...about a patient whose body disappeared
into thin fucking air.

791
00:51:36,480 --> 00:51:40,320
But that probably just makes me sound
druggie and paranoid, right?

792
00:51:42,480 --> 00:51:44,600
I'll be specific. I think it's you.

793
00:51:44,680 --> 00:51:48,240
I don't know what you're doing,
but I hope it makes you rich or....

794
00:51:51,760 --> 00:51:53,960
We found Claude Minkins.

795
00:51:55,480 --> 00:51:59,320
It was a clerical error. He was buried
four days ago, potter's field.

796
00:52:18,280 --> 00:52:20,080
Guy, please.

797
00:53:19,480 --> 00:53:21,200
Sorry, Doc. Never heard of it.

798
00:53:21,280 --> 00:53:24,760
It could be some kind of men's shelter.
Or a church?

799
00:53:25,760 --> 00:53:27,800
You never heard anyone talk of The Room?

800
00:53:27,880 --> 00:53:30,920
The Room? They got rooms
all over the place.

801
00:53:31,040 --> 00:53:33,120
They got rooms all over this city.

802
00:53:33,200 --> 00:53:35,680
Everybody got a room but us, right?

803
00:53:39,600 --> 00:53:41,360
Thanks, Bobby. Thanks.

804
00:53:44,840 --> 00:53:47,840
You're talking about the worms, right?

805
00:53:48,440 --> 00:53:49,600
No, The Room.

806
00:53:49,680 --> 00:53:51,760
I know. Yeah, I know.

807
00:53:52,280 --> 00:53:54,440
Down with the worm people.

808
00:53:54,640 --> 00:53:56,400
It's some kind of shelter?

809
00:53:56,640 --> 00:53:57,920
Ain't no shelter.

810
00:53:58,440 --> 00:54:00,280
It's their home.

811
00:54:01,160 --> 00:54:03,960
It's that underground shit.

812
00:54:05,040 --> 00:54:06,160
The worms.

813
00:54:07,720 --> 00:54:09,120
Track rats.

814
00:54:09,400 --> 00:54:10,600
Mole people.

815
00:54:12,280 --> 00:54:13,680
I don't understand.

816
00:54:13,760 --> 00:54:14,920
The Room.

817
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:17,600
There's all kinds of places like that.

818
00:54:17,800 --> 00:54:19,880
People living underground.

819
00:54:20,120 --> 00:54:21,800
Whole bunches of them.

820
00:54:21,920 --> 00:54:23,280
All over the city.

821
00:54:23,560 --> 00:54:24,600
You know it?

822
00:54:24,680 --> 00:54:28,040
I don't like it dark like that. I like the park.

823
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:34,320
-Do you know where it is?
-I don't go down. You gotta be a mole.

824
00:54:34,400 --> 00:54:36,320
And you gotta know the way.

825
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:40,320
Wait a minute. Where can I find one...

826
00:54:40,520 --> 00:54:41,960
...of these moles?

827
00:54:42,040 --> 00:54:43,960
I know a half-mole.

828
00:54:44,440 --> 00:54:46,520
The guy we turn the cans over to.

829
00:54:46,760 --> 00:54:48,400
I see him all the time.

830
00:54:48,520 --> 00:54:50,400
That's how I know about this.

831
00:54:50,520 --> 00:54:51,800
Can I meet this guy?

832
00:54:51,880 --> 00:54:53,200
Slow down, Doc.

833
00:54:53,360 --> 00:54:55,160
We gotta work something out.

834
00:54:55,280 --> 00:54:57,000
What are you talking about?

835
00:54:57,080 --> 00:54:58,520
You know, man.

836
00:55:00,800 --> 00:55:03,160
-How much do you want?
-I don't want your money.

837
00:55:03,240 --> 00:55:06,720
Come on, me and you are friends.
What do you take me for?

838
00:55:07,040 --> 00:55:09,640
-I'm sorry--
-A couple of scrips is all we need.

839
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:13,360
No way. I won't do that. Forget it.

840
00:55:13,480 --> 00:55:15,600
Doc, are you sure? I mean...

841
00:55:15,840 --> 00:55:17,640
...this surely smells important.

842
00:55:30,480 --> 00:55:31,600
Excuse me.

843
00:55:32,880 --> 00:55:34,120
Excuse me.

844
00:55:43,480 --> 00:55:45,520
-What are you doing?
-I came to see you.

845
00:55:45,600 --> 00:55:49,720
I saw you getting on the bus. I'm sorry.
I wanted to ask you a favor.

846
00:55:50,600 --> 00:55:52,120
Look, Guy, I'm sorry.

847
00:55:52,240 --> 00:55:53,560
We all are.

848
00:55:53,680 --> 00:55:55,160
The whole thing....

849
00:55:55,480 --> 00:55:57,200
We're all in shock.

850
00:55:59,960 --> 00:56:04,000
I don't know what to say. You were
a great doctor. I just don't know...

851
00:56:04,200 --> 00:56:06,040
...why you needed drugs.

852
00:56:07,040 --> 00:56:10,320
Someone planted that cocaine
in my apartment.

853
00:56:10,880 --> 00:56:14,120
Someone took the cocaine from
the hospital and staged a break-in...

854
00:56:14,200 --> 00:56:15,600
...to attract the police.

855
00:56:15,680 --> 00:56:17,280
What are you talking about?

856
00:56:19,800 --> 00:56:22,360
I need someone to check the staff logs.

857
00:56:22,960 --> 00:56:26,000
September 1 1, October 9, last fall.
It's written here.

858
00:56:26,320 --> 00:56:30,440
I need to know who was on ER duty
when Minkins and Dolson were seen.

859
00:56:31,800 --> 00:56:33,560
What are you doing? Why?

860
00:56:33,640 --> 00:56:37,240
Because someone who worked these shifts
has destroyed my life.

861
00:56:37,440 --> 00:56:39,120
I'm fucked, Jodie.

862
00:56:39,320 --> 00:56:43,320
It doesn't matter what happens in court.
I won't practice medicine again.

863
00:56:43,600 --> 00:56:46,720
Not here. Not in England. Nowhere. Ever.

864
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:49,160
Why me?

865
00:56:50,360 --> 00:56:53,120
Because you have access
to the fourth floor.

866
00:56:57,640 --> 00:56:59,840
Look, I've put my number on there.

867
00:57:01,880 --> 00:57:02,960
Please?

868
00:57:05,480 --> 00:57:07,000
Think about it.

869
00:57:15,560 --> 00:57:16,760
Althea Dolson?

870
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:20,040
Althea. Right, I beg your pardon.

871
00:57:20,800 --> 00:57:25,400
Thank you. My name's Harbash.
I'm a doctor at Gramercy Hospital.

872
00:57:25,960 --> 00:57:27,440
I wonder if you'd help me.

873
00:57:27,560 --> 00:57:31,480
We're trying to locate anyone
who might know a Theodore Dolson.

874
00:57:33,600 --> 00:57:34,880
You don't.

875
00:57:35,680 --> 00:57:36,640
All right...

876
00:57:36,840 --> 00:57:39,000
...thank you very much, anyway.

877
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:42,920
What kind of pain is that?

878
00:57:44,440 --> 00:57:48,560
Right, so that's a sort of high fever
and a sore throat.

879
00:57:49,280 --> 00:57:52,000
That would be very hard for me to say.

880
00:57:52,160 --> 00:57:54,440
You'd have to have a culture taken.

881
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:58,800
Could you hang on for me?
I've got a call coming in.

882
00:57:58,960 --> 00:58:01,000
Thank you. Sorry. Hello?

883
00:58:01,200 --> 00:58:02,560
It's happy hour, Doc.

884
00:58:02,640 --> 00:58:05,400
We have found Mr. Half-Mole.

885
00:58:05,720 --> 00:58:07,840
Right. You got our finders' fee...

886
00:58:07,960 --> 00:58:10,760
...and Mr. Half-Mole says
he knows about these rooms...

887
00:58:10,840 --> 00:58:14,200
...and it's a $100 tour.
You got 15 minutes to meet us.

888
00:58:14,720 --> 00:58:16,040
Okay, fine. Where?

889
00:58:16,200 --> 00:58:18,400
Grand Central information booth.

890
00:58:18,480 --> 00:58:20,480
And don't forget. No scrip...

891
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:22,440
...no trip.

892
00:58:27,880 --> 00:58:28,920
My man.

893
00:58:33,040 --> 00:58:35,040
Okay, here we go.

894
00:58:36,280 --> 00:58:37,640
I could take him out now.

895
00:58:39,560 --> 00:58:42,280
Listen, he's got a line on Dolson.

896
00:58:42,480 --> 00:58:45,120
Come on, man. He's gonna
take us right to him.

897
00:58:49,400 --> 00:58:50,640
Shit! Shit!

898
00:58:50,800 --> 00:58:51,760
It's one way!

899
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:53,560
Go! Pull around the block.

900
00:58:53,680 --> 00:58:55,080
-Go! Go!
-I got it.

901
00:58:58,920 --> 00:58:59,960
Watch it!

902
00:59:02,120 --> 00:59:03,080
Fuck him. Go!

903
00:59:03,600 --> 00:59:04,560
Around here.

904
00:59:08,240 --> 00:59:09,640
Shit! Shit!

905
00:59:10,760 --> 00:59:12,000
Son of a--

906
00:59:14,280 --> 00:59:17,800
Why didn't you move the fucking truck?
Are you fucking blind?

907
00:59:17,920 --> 00:59:19,480
Are you fucking blind?

908
00:59:19,640 --> 00:59:21,480
Move your fucking truck!

909
00:59:21,560 --> 00:59:23,000
Goddamn it!

910
00:59:23,200 --> 00:59:24,640
Goddamn it!

911
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:27,320
I'll move the fucking thing for you.

912
00:59:37,600 --> 00:59:39,360
It's about time, man.

913
00:59:39,440 --> 00:59:40,880
So where is he?

914
00:59:47,800 --> 00:59:50,160
-Where is he?
-He's behind me. Track 24.

915
00:59:53,960 --> 00:59:55,080
And, Doc...

916
00:59:56,640 --> 00:59:57,920
...you be careful.

917
00:59:58,560 --> 01:00:00,040
Watch your ass.

918
01:00:25,480 --> 01:00:27,160
So, is it far?

919
01:00:29,200 --> 01:00:30,200
Excuse me.

920
01:00:30,320 --> 01:00:31,600
Is it far?

921
01:00:32,680 --> 01:00:34,120
Tell me how far, roughly.

922
01:00:36,760 --> 01:00:38,840
Hey, pal. What's your hurry?

923
01:01:22,160 --> 01:01:25,240
-Look, man, that's the straight shit.
-Dr. Luthan.

924
01:01:30,840 --> 01:01:33,640
That's amazing. I swear
I saw you in the park...

925
01:01:33,720 --> 01:01:35,560
...talking to a Dr. Luthan.

926
01:02:06,720 --> 01:02:07,840
Hello?

927
01:02:09,040 --> 01:02:10,040
Are you there?

928
01:02:10,560 --> 01:02:11,760
Are we in The Room?

929
01:03:42,720 --> 01:03:44,560
So it's down there?

930
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:47,920
Is it down there? Are we there?

931
01:03:49,600 --> 01:03:51,840
I'm not gonna pay you till I get there.

932
01:03:54,160 --> 01:03:56,120
I don't go down there.

933
01:04:04,880 --> 01:04:07,960
-How do I know you're telling the truth?
-You're still alive.

934
01:04:12,600 --> 01:04:14,360
To the bottom and through.

935
01:04:24,280 --> 01:04:25,360
Hey, wait!

936
01:04:26,560 --> 01:04:27,880
Wait!

937
01:04:34,200 --> 01:04:35,680
Fuck this whole....

938
01:04:46,600 --> 01:04:47,800
Come on.

939
01:04:49,080 --> 01:04:50,120
Come on.

940
01:05:29,680 --> 01:05:30,880
Someone there?

941
01:05:35,640 --> 01:05:36,800
Someone there?

942
01:05:37,880 --> 01:05:39,240
Shit!

943
01:05:42,160 --> 01:05:43,640
Okay, look...

944
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:47,320
...if someone's there listening,
I'm looking for Teddy Dolson.

945
01:05:47,400 --> 01:05:49,160
Jesus Christ!

946
01:06:34,800 --> 01:06:36,120
Let him go.

947
01:06:40,720 --> 01:06:42,160
Who are you with?

948
01:06:46,360 --> 01:06:47,720
Who did you come with?

949
01:06:50,640 --> 01:06:51,680
No one.

950
01:06:52,680 --> 01:06:54,040
Who sent you?

951
01:06:54,720 --> 01:06:55,840
No one.

952
01:06:56,640 --> 01:06:58,240
I'm looking for Teddy Dolson.

953
01:07:00,640 --> 01:07:03,520
-Claude Minkins told me about this--
-Where is he?

954
01:07:04,920 --> 01:07:06,240
Where's Claude?

955
01:07:09,560 --> 01:07:13,800
Claude came into the hospital
where I work. I'm a doctor.

956
01:07:15,200 --> 01:07:16,680
He was very sick.

957
01:07:19,840 --> 01:07:22,040
We did everything we could for him.

958
01:07:23,480 --> 01:07:24,880
He didn't make it.

959
01:07:29,600 --> 01:07:30,880
You've come for Teddy?

960
01:07:33,760 --> 01:07:35,520
Yeah, is he here?

961
01:07:36,040 --> 01:07:38,000
Are you going to kill him too?

962
01:07:39,920 --> 01:07:41,720
Jesus, I'm not killing anyone.

963
01:07:42,320 --> 01:07:43,120
Listen....

964
01:07:43,280 --> 01:07:45,240
Do you understand where you are?

965
01:07:46,040 --> 01:07:47,680
This is our home.

966
01:07:47,800 --> 01:07:49,200
We have rules.

967
01:07:49,400 --> 01:07:52,080
You think we keep healthy
so you can kill us?

968
01:07:52,160 --> 01:07:55,160
-I won't kill anyone. I'm on your side.
-Bullshit!

969
01:07:55,240 --> 01:07:56,880
-They don't believe you.
-You're dead!

970
01:07:56,960 --> 01:08:00,480
Listen to me for fuck's sake!
I'm on my own. I'm not killing anyone!

971
01:08:00,640 --> 01:08:05,040
I'm here because whoever did kill Claude
has also fucked up my life.

972
01:08:08,160 --> 01:08:09,360
Is Teddy here?

973
01:08:10,760 --> 01:08:14,160
If Teddy is here and he's sick,
you have to let me see him.

974
01:08:19,800 --> 01:08:21,080
He's here.

975
01:08:32,760 --> 01:08:34,800
-How long has he been like this?
-Four days.

976
01:08:34,880 --> 01:08:38,320
They found him at the steam pipes,
trying to make his way here.

977
01:08:38,400 --> 01:08:40,680
His fever, is it up and down? Pulse?

978
01:08:40,800 --> 01:08:42,800
We stopped trying to count.

979
01:08:42,920 --> 01:08:45,200
What are they doing to all these people?

980
01:08:45,480 --> 01:08:47,640
What do you mean, '"all these people'"?

981
01:08:48,840 --> 01:08:49,880
Claude and Teddy?

982
01:08:49,960 --> 01:08:51,440
And the others.

983
01:08:52,160 --> 01:08:52,920
What others?

984
01:08:53,040 --> 01:08:54,880
Gramercy. That's where we all go.

985
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:56,520
What are you talking about?

986
01:08:56,600 --> 01:08:59,280
He knows!
And this motherfucker's in on it.

987
01:09:02,960 --> 01:09:06,400
A runner's missing from The Condo.
A guy from the train yards.

988
01:09:06,560 --> 01:09:08,880
A woman came through
looking for her son.

989
01:09:08,960 --> 01:09:10,400
They take the strong ones.

990
01:09:10,480 --> 01:09:12,440
They take men. Why?

991
01:09:14,960 --> 01:09:17,000
That's why they do the lab tests.

992
01:09:17,120 --> 01:09:18,040
Who's '"they'"?

993
01:09:18,960 --> 01:09:21,440
Yes, that's why they do the lab tests.

994
01:09:22,400 --> 01:09:24,360
Someone's looking for healthy subjects.

995
01:09:24,640 --> 01:09:25,640
Why us?

996
01:09:27,280 --> 01:09:29,280
They think you won't be missed.

997
01:09:32,280 --> 01:09:35,000
So did Teddy say anything?
Who found him?

998
01:09:35,080 --> 01:09:36,760
He never said nothing.

999
01:09:36,960 --> 01:09:40,200
He was just laying there,
twitching and bleeding.

1000
01:09:40,920 --> 01:09:43,560
-He's bleeding?
-His back is all fucked up.

1001
01:09:43,680 --> 01:09:45,680
I thought someone knifed him.

1002
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:48,720
I wanna turn him over. Give me a hand.

1003
01:09:48,880 --> 01:09:50,080
On three. Two...

1004
01:09:50,520 --> 01:09:51,600
...three.

1005
01:09:57,200 --> 01:09:58,920
Jesus Christ.

1006
01:10:00,040 --> 01:10:02,120
They're playing with healthy spines.

1007
01:10:02,520 --> 01:10:03,640
Someone's cut--

1008
01:10:04,280 --> 01:10:07,320
-Okay, hold him.
-What's wrong with him?

1009
01:10:07,440 --> 01:10:09,840
-I don't know. How far is it to the street?
-Why?

1010
01:10:09,920 --> 01:10:12,560
-He needs a hospital now.
-We take care of him.

1011
01:10:12,640 --> 01:10:16,800
He is crashing, understand?
If we don't get him on an IV, he'll die.

1012
01:10:45,880 --> 01:10:48,520
Let's start by putting that body down...

1013
01:10:48,800 --> 01:10:51,560
...and getting your hands out
where I can see them.

1014
01:10:57,320 --> 01:10:59,880
Put the stretcher down.

1015
01:11:00,880 --> 01:11:04,440
I'm Special Agent Hare,
Federal Bureau of Investigation.

1016
01:11:04,640 --> 01:11:07,720
This is Detective Burke of the NYPD.

1017
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:10,760
Get your hands above your heads
and come forward.

1018
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:14,200
We got a sick man.
We're getting him to the hospital.

1019
01:11:15,040 --> 01:11:16,600
Maybe you didn't hear me.

1020
01:11:16,680 --> 01:11:18,920
I heard you. I heard you.

1021
01:11:19,800 --> 01:11:21,360
What's the FBI doing here?

1022
01:11:22,160 --> 01:11:24,000
We're working a kidnapping.

1023
01:11:24,160 --> 01:11:26,000
Have you seen anyone back there?

1024
01:11:28,320 --> 01:11:31,840
No, we ain't seen nobody down here, man.
It's just us.

1025
01:11:32,160 --> 01:11:35,800
This man is dying here.
You've got a radio. Call for help.

1026
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:37,360
Radios don't work here.

1027
01:11:37,480 --> 01:11:40,120
Come on, Doc. Move it.
We don't have all day.

1028
01:11:41,680 --> 01:11:43,600
How'd you know I was a doctor?

1029
01:11:45,680 --> 01:11:47,760
Shit! They're gonna kill us!

1030
01:11:47,840 --> 01:11:49,600
They're gonna kill us!

1031
01:11:52,640 --> 01:11:55,520
Oh, no. I ain't got no beef with you guys.

1032
01:11:56,120 --> 01:11:57,240
Talk to me, Frank.

1033
01:11:57,360 --> 01:11:58,960
Get going. All the way back.

1034
01:11:59,040 --> 01:12:00,840
-I'm homeless.
-Keep your hands up.

1035
01:12:01,240 --> 01:12:02,160
Move.

1036
01:12:02,240 --> 01:12:03,320
Move!

1037
01:12:03,560 --> 01:12:05,520
You stay right where you are!

1038
01:12:06,400 --> 01:12:10,000
If you want me out of here,
just say the word and I'm gone.

1039
01:12:10,840 --> 01:12:12,360
Just take it easy. Frank.

1040
01:12:16,400 --> 01:12:17,480
Shit!

1041
01:12:27,960 --> 01:12:28,760
Jesus.

1042
01:12:37,040 --> 01:12:38,120
Bob!

1043
01:12:39,480 --> 01:12:41,120
You son of a bitch.

1044
01:13:09,880 --> 01:13:11,640
He's getting away! Let's go.

1045
01:13:11,720 --> 01:13:13,600
Come on, Bob! Get going! Move!

1046
01:13:21,920 --> 01:13:24,040
Frank, you gotta help me!

1047
01:13:32,200 --> 01:13:33,360
Come back!

1048
01:13:33,560 --> 01:13:34,960
Get me out of here!

1049
01:13:37,200 --> 01:13:39,080
Hey, what are you doing?

1050
01:15:01,960 --> 01:15:02,800
Dispatch.

1051
01:15:02,880 --> 01:15:04,400
Dispatch. Twenty-nine to dispatch.

1052
01:15:04,480 --> 01:15:06,520
We got a man on the line. He's armed.

1053
01:15:08,600 --> 01:15:10,520
Judith? It's Guy.

1054
01:15:10,800 --> 01:15:13,640
Can you hear me?
If you can hear me, please pick up.

1055
01:15:13,720 --> 01:15:15,680
Please pick up. I know it's late.

1056
01:15:15,880 --> 01:15:17,240
I've been shot.

1057
01:15:17,480 --> 01:15:18,680
You've gotta help me.

1058
01:15:18,800 --> 01:15:22,960
This whole thing, it's real.
There are three men dead back there.

1059
01:15:23,200 --> 01:15:26,240
I swear, it's huge. Judith, please pick up!

1060
01:15:26,560 --> 01:15:30,360
They hijack people from the hospital
and use them for research.

1061
01:15:30,520 --> 01:15:32,520
Triphase is a research program...

1062
01:15:32,600 --> 01:15:35,480
...and someone at Gramercy
is working for them.

1063
01:15:35,560 --> 01:15:37,920
Listen, there's a cop called Stone.

1064
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:41,280
Call him, he might believe me.
I have to talk to you.

1065
01:15:42,280 --> 01:15:43,320
Are you all right?

1066
01:15:45,120 --> 01:15:47,120
Hey, you're bleeding!

1067
01:15:58,080 --> 01:16:00,480
-Who is it?
-It's Guy Luthan.

1068
01:16:00,640 --> 01:16:02,000
You know what time it is?

1069
01:16:02,120 --> 01:16:04,520
Yeah, I know. I'm sorry. I just....

1070
01:16:04,720 --> 01:16:08,720
-It's 4:00 a.m. What do you want?
-The staff logs, did you....

1071
01:16:08,840 --> 01:16:10,040
What did you say?

1072
01:16:10,160 --> 01:16:12,840
Jodie, please. This is really important.

1073
01:16:22,960 --> 01:16:25,720
You have to be quiet. My brother's asleep.

1074
01:16:27,160 --> 01:16:29,080
My God, what happened?

1075
01:16:29,520 --> 01:16:30,840
I'm okay.

1076
01:16:31,600 --> 01:16:33,240
Oh, my God. That's a gunshot.

1077
01:16:33,320 --> 01:16:35,360
It's okay. It looks worse than it is.

1078
01:16:35,480 --> 01:16:37,960
-You're walking around like this?
-Yeah...

1079
01:16:38,080 --> 01:16:39,440
...I can't go home.

1080
01:16:39,520 --> 01:16:40,760
What happened?

1081
01:16:41,040 --> 01:16:43,840
It doesn't matter.
I can prove this whole thing now.

1082
01:16:43,920 --> 01:16:45,120
Listen.

1083
01:16:45,520 --> 01:16:48,440
You'll come in and you'll be quiet, all right?

1084
01:16:48,680 --> 01:16:51,120
This has to be looked at. Jesus.

1085
01:16:52,040 --> 01:16:53,800
You're losing a lot of blood.

1086
01:16:53,960 --> 01:16:55,240
Where did this happen?

1087
01:16:55,440 --> 01:16:58,440
It's okay. No one knows I'm here.
No one followed me.

1088
01:17:01,840 --> 01:17:02,920
Shit.

1089
01:17:03,680 --> 01:17:05,000
It's okay.

1090
01:17:05,560 --> 01:17:06,920
Someone's here.

1091
01:17:07,080 --> 01:17:08,040
What's going on?

1092
01:17:08,120 --> 01:17:11,400
It's Dr. Luthan from work,
from the hospital. It's okay.

1093
01:17:13,920 --> 01:17:14,960
What happened?

1094
01:17:15,240 --> 01:17:16,520
He was shot.

1095
01:17:20,200 --> 01:17:21,840
Take your coat off.

1096
01:17:23,400 --> 01:17:25,880
The staff logs, are they still there?

1097
01:17:26,720 --> 01:17:27,560
And?

1098
01:17:27,720 --> 01:17:31,320
We'll talk about that later.
You're in shock. You need to sit down.

1099
01:17:32,160 --> 01:17:34,040
Here. Take your shirt off.

1100
01:17:36,400 --> 01:17:40,280
Hold this there. Put pressure on it,
and I'll get a first-aid kit.

1101
01:17:40,440 --> 01:17:41,760
I'll be back.

1102
01:18:28,560 --> 01:18:30,720
So tell me about Triphase.

1103
01:18:53,120 --> 01:18:54,760
I didn't even take lunch.

1104
01:18:54,840 --> 01:18:57,240
I stopped for five minutes
and there's six interns...

1105
01:18:57,320 --> 01:18:59,560
...watching TV, eating popcorn.

1106
01:18:59,800 --> 01:19:01,800
And you've been running all day long.

1107
01:19:01,880 --> 01:19:03,600
Tell me about it.

1108
01:19:03,720 --> 01:19:06,240
What do you know?
You better get his doctor.

1109
01:19:06,360 --> 01:19:07,480
I'm on it.

1110
01:19:16,960 --> 01:19:18,720
-He's coming around?
-Yes.

1111
01:19:18,840 --> 01:19:20,000
You can go.

1112
01:19:30,800 --> 01:19:32,320
Can you hear me?

1113
01:19:35,480 --> 01:19:37,320
My name is Dr. Mingus.

1114
01:19:38,840 --> 01:19:42,040
You're in the Acute Care Ward
at Riverside Hospital.

1115
01:19:42,280 --> 01:19:45,600
You were found five days ago
by the boat basin in Central Park.

1116
01:19:45,720 --> 01:19:47,240
You'd been shot.

1117
01:19:47,560 --> 01:19:51,560
You lost a great deal of blood.
You've been in a coma until today.

1118
01:19:51,840 --> 01:19:55,320
We didn't know who you were till today.
We contacted your family.

1119
01:19:55,400 --> 01:19:57,920
Your brother is flying in
tomorrow morning.

1120
01:19:59,360 --> 01:20:01,320
I need to talk to the police.

1121
01:20:01,640 --> 01:20:04,240
Sure. As soon as you're stabilized.

1122
01:20:08,640 --> 01:20:10,000
I can't move.

1123
01:20:15,600 --> 01:20:17,440
The gunshot....

1124
01:20:17,600 --> 01:20:22,040
As I said, you lost blood. But we have
other problems to look at now.

1125
01:20:24,680 --> 01:20:26,120
Why can't I move?

1126
01:20:27,200 --> 01:20:29,040
I have some tough news, Guy.

1127
01:20:30,680 --> 01:20:33,200
Listen to me very carefully.
Can you do that?

1128
01:20:35,840 --> 01:20:38,560
You sustained a serious blow
to your upper back.

1129
01:20:38,720 --> 01:20:42,640
There was a severe cervical fracture
of the sixth vertebra.

1130
01:20:42,800 --> 01:20:44,160
Somehow...

1131
01:20:44,360 --> 01:20:46,080
...we're not quite sure...

1132
01:20:46,520 --> 01:20:47,800
...your spinal cord...

1133
01:20:48,040 --> 01:20:49,280
...was cut.

1134
01:20:50,840 --> 01:20:53,840
At the moment, you're paralyzed
from the neck down.

1135
01:20:55,080 --> 01:20:57,000
We did everything we could.

1136
01:20:57,120 --> 01:20:58,760
I'm terribly sorry.

1137
01:21:06,600 --> 01:21:08,760
Guy, listen to me.

1138
01:21:09,080 --> 01:21:11,480
This is not the end of your life.

1139
01:21:11,680 --> 01:21:13,160
Not by any means.

1140
01:21:13,360 --> 01:21:16,960
I know it's hard to accept,
but you'll learn to do things...

1141
01:21:17,120 --> 01:21:19,840
...that you wouldn't believe possible
right now.

1142
01:21:20,040 --> 01:21:23,320
You're going to have a different life,
that's for sure...

1143
01:21:23,520 --> 01:21:27,560
...but it can still be a great life
and a fulfilling life, believe me.

1144
01:21:30,400 --> 01:21:33,880
Whenever you feel ready,
you can meet with our counseling people.

1145
01:21:35,680 --> 01:21:38,080
We have an amazing program here.

1146
01:21:40,160 --> 01:21:41,280
Please...

1147
01:21:42,680 --> 01:21:44,040
...leave me alone.

1148
01:21:48,280 --> 01:21:49,840
I'll look in on you later.

1149
01:22:51,920 --> 01:22:53,280
Dr. Luthan?

1150
01:23:06,520 --> 01:23:07,520
Guy.

1151
01:23:09,360 --> 01:23:10,920
It's Dr. Myrick.

1152
01:23:15,560 --> 01:23:17,560
I came over as soon as I heard.

1153
01:23:19,440 --> 01:23:21,560
Dr. Mingus was a student of mine.

1154
01:23:26,160 --> 01:23:29,000
I've seen your chart. It's a terrible thing.

1155
01:23:29,520 --> 01:23:31,360
I'd like to try to help.

1156
01:23:34,560 --> 01:23:36,280
If you want to help me...

1157
01:23:37,400 --> 01:23:38,880
...let me die.

1158
01:23:40,600 --> 01:23:42,440
That's a common request.

1159
01:23:43,000 --> 01:23:44,000
Please.

1160
01:23:44,800 --> 01:23:47,560
Four hundred of potassium chloride
in my IV.

1161
01:23:54,920 --> 01:23:56,440
What if there was hope?

1162
01:23:58,640 --> 01:23:59,640
There isn't.

1163
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:15,560
What if there was hope?

1164
01:24:17,960 --> 01:24:19,280
What would it be worth...

1165
01:24:19,360 --> 01:24:22,440
...to be able to walk again,
to be able to feed yourself?

1166
01:24:22,800 --> 01:24:24,400
To go back to your old life?

1167
01:24:24,480 --> 01:24:25,960
To be a doctor.

1168
01:24:27,080 --> 01:24:28,680
What would you endure?

1169
01:24:31,360 --> 01:24:32,960
What are you talking about?

1170
01:24:33,760 --> 01:24:35,840
I'm asking you a question.

1171
01:24:37,560 --> 01:24:39,200
What would that be worth?

1172
01:24:41,320 --> 01:24:42,880
I can't live like this.

1173
01:24:45,240 --> 01:24:47,040
With proper care...

1174
01:24:47,680 --> 01:24:49,720
...you can live 20 years like this.

1175
01:24:53,560 --> 01:24:54,960
What would you do?

1176
01:24:56,440 --> 01:24:58,000
What would you risk...

1177
01:24:58,080 --> 01:24:59,600
...to change that?

1178
01:25:02,560 --> 01:25:05,520
I have a C6 break in my cord.

1179
01:25:07,040 --> 01:25:10,360
What if I told you there was a chance
you could be healed?

1180
01:25:14,680 --> 01:25:17,440
That there was a procedure
that offered you...

1181
01:25:17,640 --> 01:25:19,360
...a good chance...

1182
01:25:19,520 --> 01:25:21,520
...that you might walk again?

1183
01:25:24,280 --> 01:25:26,480
What would you do to make that happen?

1184
01:25:32,760 --> 01:25:34,040
Anything.

1185
01:25:36,360 --> 01:25:37,560
Anything?

1186
01:25:47,840 --> 01:25:49,760
You'd better think about that.

1187
01:25:50,960 --> 01:25:52,360
What do you mean?

1188
01:25:53,720 --> 01:25:55,120
What do you mean?

1189
01:25:56,080 --> 01:25:57,040
Wait!

1190
01:25:58,920 --> 01:26:00,120
Dr. Myrick?

1191
01:27:06,640 --> 01:27:07,640
Quiet.

1192
01:27:07,920 --> 01:27:09,320
We have to be quiet.

1193
01:27:09,400 --> 01:27:12,400
You're not paralyzed.
It's an epidural drip. I turned it off.

1194
01:27:12,480 --> 01:27:16,440
You're not at Riverside Hospital.
This is Triphase. You're not paralyzed.

1195
01:27:18,640 --> 01:27:20,400
I don't know how you get out.

1196
01:27:20,520 --> 01:27:23,920
You're on the seventh floor.
There's a hallway just outside.

1197
01:27:25,960 --> 01:27:28,440
Listen to me. You have to get out of here.

1198
01:27:29,440 --> 01:27:31,160
-This is Triphase?
-Yes.

1199
01:27:31,920 --> 01:27:34,440
I found some clothes. Put them on.

1200
01:27:34,520 --> 01:27:35,760
What are you saying?

1201
01:27:35,840 --> 01:27:39,520
I'm sorry. It's just the stitches
from your gunshot. I can't stay.

1202
01:27:39,640 --> 01:27:42,080
-Oh, God, they're looking for me.
-Wait.

1203
01:27:42,960 --> 01:27:44,400
How can you be part of this?

1204
01:27:46,440 --> 01:27:48,000
For my brother.

1205
01:27:48,760 --> 01:27:50,960
I was driving the car when he was hurt.

1206
01:27:54,240 --> 01:27:56,160
Because I was drunk.

1207
01:27:58,040 --> 01:27:59,160
I have to go.

1208
01:28:00,880 --> 01:28:03,360
Just try to get downstairs.

1209
01:28:03,760 --> 01:28:05,200
I'm sorry.

1210
01:28:30,600 --> 01:28:32,800
-But how?
-I don't know.

1211
01:28:33,840 --> 01:28:36,080
They're still warm. He can't go far.

1212
01:28:45,760 --> 01:28:48,240
This is Helen in reception.
What's going on?

1213
01:28:52,520 --> 01:28:54,600
-Luthan's out of his room.
-What?

1214
01:28:54,680 --> 01:28:57,680
-We don't know where he is.
-I'll take the east area.

1215
01:28:57,800 --> 01:28:59,560
I'll grab the other side.

1216
01:29:09,280 --> 01:29:10,880
Don, go to one.

1217
01:29:13,200 --> 01:29:15,440
Stone still want that address
or you going home?

1218
01:29:15,520 --> 01:29:17,360
You kidding? We're going home.

1219
01:29:18,520 --> 01:29:20,080
He still wants it.

1220
01:29:20,520 --> 01:29:22,360
Okay, can you hold one second?

1221
01:29:22,560 --> 01:29:24,880
The guy's a cokehead, for chrissake.

1222
01:29:25,080 --> 01:29:27,600
I told you. He saved my guy. I owe him.

1223
01:29:28,040 --> 01:29:32,680
Okay, Triphase. 403 East 14th Street.
Look for Biosyntex.

1224
01:29:32,880 --> 01:29:34,000
Got it.

1225
01:29:55,280 --> 01:29:56,720
My God.

1226
01:30:10,680 --> 01:30:12,640
I know you can hear me.

1227
01:30:13,160 --> 01:30:15,280
We know you're in the building.

1228
01:30:16,600 --> 01:30:18,400
You've gotta listen to me.

1229
01:30:19,360 --> 01:30:22,800
You need to listen to me
before it gets out of hand.

1230
01:30:23,480 --> 01:30:25,080
Guy, you have to understand.

1231
01:30:25,160 --> 01:30:27,280
We never wanted you involved.

1232
01:30:28,120 --> 01:30:31,000
All the way along,
we tried to get you to walk away.

1233
01:30:31,160 --> 01:30:33,120
I'm not a murderer.

1234
01:30:33,320 --> 01:30:35,200
I didn't know what to do with you.

1235
01:30:35,280 --> 01:30:38,600
It was terrible to put you through it,
but I had to do it.

1236
01:30:39,280 --> 01:30:40,680
I had to make it real.

1237
01:30:41,360 --> 01:30:44,800
You had to feel it to understand
what it is we're trying to do.

1238
01:30:45,560 --> 01:30:47,000
And it is real.

1239
01:30:47,840 --> 01:30:49,800
The hope I offered in that room...

1240
01:30:50,200 --> 01:30:51,360
...it's real.

1241
01:30:51,600 --> 01:30:53,360
I can grow nerves.

1242
01:30:53,480 --> 01:30:56,120
I can grow nerves
and control their patterns.

1243
01:30:56,880 --> 01:31:00,160
Thirty hours before he came to you,
Claude Minkins...

1244
01:31:00,240 --> 01:31:03,960
...had his spine surgically severed
at the fourth vertebra.

1245
01:31:04,200 --> 01:31:06,600
Teddy Dolson lived for 12 days.

1246
01:31:07,280 --> 01:31:09,120
I can show you their charts.

1247
01:31:09,200 --> 01:31:11,040
Complete neural regeneration.

1248
01:31:12,960 --> 01:31:14,360
I can grow nerves.

1249
01:31:14,800 --> 01:31:18,240
Wejust have to stop them overgrowing.
We are that close.

1250
01:31:19,120 --> 01:31:20,880
I needed human subjects.

1251
01:31:21,080 --> 01:31:22,680
That's the awful truth.

1252
01:31:24,080 --> 01:31:26,680
Growth factors only code to species.

1253
01:31:28,480 --> 01:31:31,520
To do the work, you need human subjects.

1254
01:31:32,160 --> 01:31:34,200
And most of them will die.

1255
01:31:35,720 --> 01:31:37,160
These men...

1256
01:31:38,400 --> 01:31:40,040
...they're not victims.

1257
01:31:41,920 --> 01:31:44,120
These men are heroes.

1258
01:31:45,880 --> 01:31:47,320
Because of them...

1259
01:31:47,520 --> 01:31:49,800
...millions ofpeople will walk again.

1260
01:31:51,800 --> 01:31:53,560
You see them every night.

1261
01:31:53,800 --> 01:31:55,560
They're lost or cold...

1262
01:31:55,760 --> 01:31:57,440
...or stoned or worse.

1263
01:31:59,360 --> 01:32:00,760
They have nothing.

1264
01:32:02,000 --> 01:32:03,360
No future.

1265
01:32:03,800 --> 01:32:05,000
No family.

1266
01:32:05,960 --> 01:32:07,000
Nothing.

1267
01:32:08,360 --> 01:32:10,320
But here, with us...

1268
01:32:13,400 --> 01:32:15,440
...here they're performing miracles.

1269
01:32:17,800 --> 01:32:20,280
I've spent time learning about you.

1270
01:32:20,960 --> 01:32:24,080
You're a brilliant doctor. I'm understaffed.

1271
01:32:24,400 --> 01:32:25,720
I need you.

1272
01:32:25,960 --> 01:32:27,600
That's why you're here.

1273
01:32:28,200 --> 01:32:30,320
That's why I put you through this.

1274
01:32:31,760 --> 01:32:33,360
Let me show you what we do.

1275
01:32:34,000 --> 01:32:35,520
Let me explain it to you.

1276
01:32:35,720 --> 01:32:38,080
We need to talk. We need--

1277
01:32:38,960 --> 01:32:40,480
Hey, how you doing?

1278
01:32:41,320 --> 01:32:43,680
You need to see what it is we're doing.

1279
01:32:50,960 --> 01:32:53,800
There's a Detective Stone down here.

1280
01:32:54,040 --> 01:32:57,240
He'd like very much to speak
with someone in charge.

1281
01:32:59,880 --> 01:33:01,200
Someone's coming down.

1282
01:33:01,360 --> 01:33:02,360
Great.

1283
01:33:03,880 --> 01:33:06,280
Lock these doors. She stays here.

1284
01:33:08,720 --> 01:33:12,080
I don't want him leaving here alive.
Find him, okay?

1285
01:34:04,200 --> 01:34:05,040
Gentlemen...

1286
01:34:05,120 --> 01:34:06,600
...how do you do?

1287
01:34:06,880 --> 01:34:09,600
I'm Dr. Myrick. How can I help you?

1288
01:34:23,200 --> 01:34:24,920
This is Triphase.

1289
01:34:26,080 --> 01:34:29,680
-You've got the right place.
-And it wasn't easy. It took us--

1290
01:34:29,840 --> 01:34:33,360
Had a guy, spent four hours
trying to get your phone number.

1291
01:34:34,280 --> 01:34:36,240
So let me get this straight.

1292
01:34:36,360 --> 01:34:40,080
Triphase is like a part of Biosyntex, right?

1293
01:34:40,360 --> 01:34:44,600
That's it. Yes. Look, I'm right
in the middle of a procedure upstairs.

1294
01:34:44,680 --> 01:34:46,000
Could we....

1295
01:34:58,200 --> 01:35:01,400
You know a Dr. Judith Gruszynski?

1296
01:35:01,640 --> 01:35:03,120
From Gramercy Hospital.

1297
01:35:03,200 --> 01:35:05,120
-Is she all right?
-She's fine.

1298
01:35:05,720 --> 01:35:09,560
She got this nutty call from a guy
named Luthan. Dr. Luthan.

1299
01:35:09,640 --> 01:35:11,000
You know him?

1300
01:35:12,440 --> 01:35:13,480
Is he a student?

1301
01:35:13,840 --> 01:35:16,080
No, he's in Emergency. He's a Brit.

1302
01:35:39,440 --> 01:35:41,400
Did you check the scrub room?

1303
01:35:41,480 --> 01:35:42,640
Nothing.

1304
01:35:43,720 --> 01:35:45,000
Do it again.

1305
01:35:45,520 --> 01:35:46,880
I'm going down.

1306
01:36:12,640 --> 01:36:15,200
Can I ask what the hell you do here?

1307
01:36:15,840 --> 01:36:18,680
Research. Medical research.
I'm a neurologist.

1308
01:36:18,800 --> 01:36:20,160
Is that right?

1309
01:36:34,240 --> 01:36:37,160
Are you talking about the doctor
arrested for drugs?

1310
01:36:37,320 --> 01:36:38,520
That's right.

1311
01:36:48,680 --> 01:36:50,640
I really do need to get upstairs.

1312
01:36:50,720 --> 01:36:53,360
We're freezing samples.
It's a delicate procedure.

1313
01:36:53,440 --> 01:36:55,200
We gotta get a statement.

1314
01:36:55,400 --> 01:36:58,080
Later? Could I call you?
Or come by the precinct?

1315
01:37:13,800 --> 01:37:15,120
You know...

1316
01:37:16,920 --> 01:37:19,320
...I'll be done here in about 45 minutes.

1317
01:37:19,560 --> 01:37:21,360
All right. We'll eat.

1318
01:37:21,520 --> 01:37:22,600
Perfect.

1319
01:37:33,560 --> 01:37:35,160
It's nerves, right?

1320
01:37:37,520 --> 01:37:38,440
Excuse me?

1321
01:37:38,520 --> 01:37:40,240
Neurology. It's...

1322
01:37:40,520 --> 01:37:42,240
...study of nerves.

1323
01:37:42,760 --> 01:37:44,280
Yes, nerves.

1324
01:38:34,000 --> 01:38:35,480
Are the doors locked?

1325
01:38:38,040 --> 01:38:39,040
No.

1326
01:38:53,440 --> 01:38:55,800
I'm 68 years old. I don't have much time.

1327
01:38:58,680 --> 01:39:00,760
Three years with a rat to get to a dog?

1328
01:39:00,880 --> 01:39:04,760
And after five years, if I'm lucky,
maybe I can work on a chimp?

1329
01:39:05,720 --> 01:39:07,520
We have to move faster than that.

1330
01:39:09,200 --> 01:39:11,400
I'm doing medicine
no one's ever dreamed of.

1331
01:39:11,600 --> 01:39:13,960
This is baseline neural chemistry.

1332
01:39:15,920 --> 01:39:17,080
You're killing people.

1333
01:39:18,600 --> 01:39:21,200
People die every day.
For what? For nothing.

1334
01:39:21,320 --> 01:39:23,280
Plane crash. Train wreck.

1335
01:39:24,080 --> 01:39:26,440
Bosnia. Pick your tragedy.

1336
01:39:27,120 --> 01:39:30,560
Sniper in a restaurant, 15 dead.
Story at 1 1:00. What do we do?

1337
01:39:30,960 --> 01:39:32,520
What do you do?

1338
01:39:33,120 --> 01:39:36,240
You change the channel.
You move on to the next patient.

1339
01:39:37,560 --> 01:39:40,640
You take care of the ones
you think you can save.

1340
01:39:45,200 --> 01:39:46,880
Good doctors do the correct thing.

1341
01:39:46,960 --> 01:39:50,600
Great doctors have the guts
to do the right thing.

1342
01:39:52,720 --> 01:39:54,400
Your father had those guts.

1343
01:39:55,440 --> 01:39:56,720
So do you.

1344
01:39:58,200 --> 01:40:00,800
Two patients on either side.
One, a gold-shield cop...

1345
01:40:00,960 --> 01:40:03,560
...the other, a maniac
that pulled a gun on a bus.

1346
01:40:03,720 --> 01:40:05,560
Who do you work on first?

1347
01:40:06,080 --> 01:40:07,640
You knew.

1348
01:40:09,440 --> 01:40:10,440
You knew.

1349
01:40:12,280 --> 01:40:16,080
If you could cure cancer by killing
one person, wouldn't you?

1350
01:40:16,320 --> 01:40:18,160
Wouldn't that be brave?

1351
01:40:18,840 --> 01:40:21,520
One person and cancer's gone tomorrow?

1352
01:40:27,160 --> 01:40:29,480
When you thought you were paralyzed...

1353
01:40:29,680 --> 01:40:32,640
...what would you have done
to be able to walk again?

1354
01:40:33,440 --> 01:40:34,640
'"Anything.'"

1355
01:40:35,240 --> 01:40:38,000
You said it yourself. Anything.

1356
01:40:40,200 --> 01:40:41,960
You were like that...

1357
01:40:43,720 --> 01:40:45,520
...for 24 hours.

1358
01:40:48,760 --> 01:40:51,320
Helen hasn't walked for 12 years.

1359
01:40:53,560 --> 01:40:55,320
I can cure her.

1360
01:40:56,880 --> 01:40:58,800
And everyone like her.

1361
01:41:04,640 --> 01:41:06,080
The door's open.

1362
01:41:07,800 --> 01:41:09,480
You can go out there...

1363
01:41:09,840 --> 01:41:12,560
...and put a stop to everything
and it'll be over.

1364
01:41:14,320 --> 01:41:17,720
Or we can go upstairs
and change medicine forever.

1365
01:41:19,040 --> 01:41:20,760
It's your call.

1366
01:41:35,880 --> 01:41:37,360
Maybe you're right.

1367
01:41:41,960 --> 01:41:43,920
Those men upstairs, maybe...

1368
01:41:45,440 --> 01:41:47,760
...there isn't much point to their lives.

1369
01:41:50,200 --> 01:41:52,840
Maybe they're doing a great thing
for the world.

1370
01:41:54,320 --> 01:41:56,200
Maybe they are heroes.

1371
01:42:03,360 --> 01:42:05,320
But they didn't choose to be.

1372
01:42:07,680 --> 01:42:08,840
You chose for them.

1373
01:42:11,720 --> 01:42:13,680
You didn't choose your wife...

1374
01:42:14,640 --> 01:42:16,080
...or your granddaughter.

1375
01:42:17,840 --> 01:42:19,760
You didn't ask for volunteers.

1376
01:42:21,560 --> 01:42:23,120
You chose for them.

1377
01:42:24,080 --> 01:42:25,680
And you can't do that.

1378
01:42:26,600 --> 01:42:28,400
Because you're a doctor.

1379
01:42:29,560 --> 01:42:31,160
And you took an oath.

1380
01:42:32,760 --> 01:42:34,440
And you're not God.

1381
01:42:36,120 --> 01:42:39,840
So I don't care if you can do
what you say you can.

1382
01:42:40,680 --> 01:42:43,920
Or if you can cure every disease
on this planet.

1383
01:42:45,080 --> 01:42:48,000
You tortured and murdered
those men upstairs.

1384
01:42:49,640 --> 01:42:52,080
That makes you a disgrace
to your profession.

1385
01:42:53,520 --> 01:42:56,280
I hope you go to jail
for the rest of your life.

1386
01:43:06,400 --> 01:43:07,640
I'm sorry.

1387
01:43:32,760 --> 01:43:34,240
Help him, please!

1388
01:43:34,560 --> 01:43:35,840
Please help him.

1389
01:43:36,000 --> 01:43:37,080
He's been shot!

1390
01:43:37,160 --> 01:43:39,600
Oh, no, no! God, no!

1391
01:43:41,640 --> 01:43:43,280
Help him, he's been shot.

1392
01:44:13,320 --> 01:44:14,720
Help me.

1393
01:44:20,520 --> 01:44:21,840
Please.

1394
01:44:43,120 --> 01:44:44,560
Get some backup.

1395
01:44:48,480 --> 01:44:49,520
You okay?

1396
01:45:25,320 --> 01:45:29,720
I didn't think it was possible,
but your cafeteria is worse than ours.

1397
01:45:29,920 --> 01:45:31,120
I like it.

1398
01:45:31,480 --> 01:45:32,840
I'm sure you do.

1399
01:45:34,000 --> 01:45:37,320
So will you visit us soon,
or are you too high and mighty now?

1400
01:45:37,520 --> 01:45:39,560
I think I'm too high and mighty.

1401
01:45:39,720 --> 01:45:42,440
-I'll come. Soon. How is everyone?
-Pretty good.

1402
01:45:43,600 --> 01:45:45,400
Jodie starts again in the fall.

1403
01:45:46,600 --> 01:45:48,120
Yeah, I heard that.

1404
01:45:49,360 --> 01:45:50,520
That's great.

1405
01:45:51,160 --> 01:45:52,600
She did okay.

1406
01:45:53,160 --> 01:45:56,320
So come visit us.
Don't forget who your real friends are.

1407
01:45:56,960 --> 01:45:59,000
The ones who fired me, right?

1408
01:46:02,040 --> 01:46:03,640
You looked pretty guilty.

1409
01:46:04,040 --> 01:46:06,280
You didn't look unfishy yourself.

1410
01:46:08,560 --> 01:46:09,560
I'm sorry.

1411
01:46:09,960 --> 01:46:11,200
You should be.

1412
01:46:14,960 --> 01:46:18,040
-Take care. Good to see you.
-Good to see you too.

1413
01:46:18,680 --> 01:46:21,200
-Next time, I pick the restaurant.
-Right.

1414
01:46:23,360 --> 01:46:24,560
Dr. Luthan?

1415
01:46:31,200 --> 01:46:33,400
You're from Dr. Cohen's office, right?

1416
01:46:36,560 --> 01:46:38,160
My name is Myrick.

1417
01:46:38,840 --> 01:46:40,080
Ruth Myrick.

1418
01:46:48,480 --> 01:46:50,760
-Would you like to come inside?
-No.

1419
01:46:52,360 --> 01:46:53,360
Thank you.

1420
01:46:55,080 --> 01:46:58,160
I have been trying to decide
what to do about this...

1421
01:46:58,640 --> 01:47:01,040
...ever since my husband's death.

1422
01:47:02,080 --> 01:47:04,120
As far as I can tell...

1423
01:47:04,280 --> 01:47:07,160
...it's pretty much all the data
from his research.

1424
01:47:09,040 --> 01:47:10,880
I think you should have it.

1425
01:47:15,080 --> 01:47:17,400
I believe there's hope in this package.

1426
01:47:20,360 --> 01:47:21,600
Why me?

1427
01:47:22,080 --> 01:47:25,120
I believe my husband was trying
to do a good thing.

1428
01:47:26,720 --> 01:47:28,280
But in the wrong way.

1429
01:47:29,720 --> 01:47:31,200
Perhaps you could do it...

1430
01:47:32,720 --> 01:47:33,960
...the right way.
