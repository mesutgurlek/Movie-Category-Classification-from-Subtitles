In Hollywood,

3
00:00:17,273 --> 00:00:19,275
one of the fastest ways
to the top

4
00:00:19,275 --> 00:00:23,763
is to work for someone
who's already there.

5
00:00:23,763 --> 00:00:26,266
The system dictates
that one must first be a slave

6
00:00:26,266 --> 00:00:29,769
before you can become
a success.

7
00:00:29,769 --> 00:00:32,272
But this can be
a very demanding process.

8
00:00:32,272 --> 00:00:33,773
Only a few people
have the drive

9
00:00:34,274 --> 00:00:36,276
to endure the thousands
of indignities and hardships

10
00:00:36,776 --> 00:00:38,278
that make up the system.

11
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:42,782
Now, this drive
is usually motivated by greed,

12
00:00:43,232 --> 00:00:45,285
sometimes ambition,

13
00:00:45,785 --> 00:00:47,787
sometimes even love.

14
00:00:49,289 --> 00:00:51,791
There are stories of love
inspiring success

15
00:00:52,292 --> 00:00:54,294
over the most
insurmountable of odds.

16
00:00:56,245 --> 00:00:58,831
This is not
one of those stories.

17
00:00:59,332 --> 00:01:00,249
Buddy's doin' great,

18
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:01,834
and it's great to see you,
Derrick.

19
00:01:02,302 --> 00:01:03,303
I'll tell him
he owes you a call.

20
00:01:03,303 --> 00:01:04,804
Cool. Thanks.

21
00:01:04,804 --> 00:01:05,838
Thanks, Derrick.
Where was I?

22
00:01:05,838 --> 00:01:06,756
Shelley Winters.

23
00:01:06,756 --> 00:01:08,341
Shelley Winters.

24
00:01:08,341 --> 00:01:09,342
Buddy invites her

25
00:01:09,842 --> 00:01:11,344
to do a reading
for a part.

26
00:01:11,344 --> 00:01:12,261
Now, Shelley Winters

27
00:01:12,261 --> 00:01:13,763
has not auditioned
for a part

28
00:01:13,763 --> 00:01:15,348
in 15, 20 years,

29
00:01:15,348 --> 00:01:17,850
but Buddy can convince
a flea it needs ticks.

30
00:01:17,850 --> 00:01:19,268
That's why
the man is my guy.

31
00:01:19,268 --> 00:01:20,770
Who's Shelley Winters?

32
00:01:20,770 --> 00:01:22,355
You know,
she's the actress.

33
00:01:22,355 --> 00:01:23,356
Older, right?

34
00:01:23,356 --> 00:01:24,857
Shelley comes rolling
into the office,

35
00:01:24,857 --> 00:01:26,359
plops down in a chair.

36
00:01:26,359 --> 00:01:28,361
Buddy was working her,
sweet-talking her.

37
00:01:28,361 --> 00:01:30,780
"Got a project, new project.
Wonderful project."

38
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:32,832
Shelley's not buyin' it.
She's just sitting there.

39
00:01:32,832 --> 00:01:35,868
Finally, she reaches
into her bag,

40
00:01:35,868 --> 00:01:37,370
pulls out an Oscar.

41
00:01:37,370 --> 00:01:38,871
No way.

42
00:01:38,871 --> 00:01:40,873
An honest-to-god
Academy Award.

43
00:01:40,873 --> 00:01:42,375
You're kiddin' me.

44
00:01:42,375 --> 00:01:43,876
Buddy still doesn't
shut up.

45
00:01:43,876 --> 00:01:45,795
He's goin' on and on
and on and on.

46
00:01:45,795 --> 00:01:47,880
Buddy's sweet-talkin'
like crazy.

47
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:49,849
Shelley, not phased,

48
00:01:50,383 --> 00:01:52,885
again reaches down
into her bag.

49
00:01:52,885 --> 00:01:53,886
Pulls out another Oscar.

50
00:01:53,886 --> 00:01:55,388
2 Oscars.

51
00:01:55,388 --> 00:01:56,889
And another one.

52
00:01:56,889 --> 00:01:58,808
She's got
a line of them.

53
00:01:58,808 --> 00:02:00,309
Buddy shut up.

54
00:02:00,309 --> 00:02:02,362
The woman is surrounded
by Oscars.

55
00:02:02,362 --> 00:02:04,864
Dead silence.

56
00:02:04,864 --> 00:02:06,899
Finally, she looks him
right in the eye,

57
00:02:06,899 --> 00:02:09,402
and she says...

58
00:02:09,902 --> 00:02:11,404
"You know...

59
00:02:11,404 --> 00:02:13,790
some people
think I can act."

61
00:02:18,244 --> 00:02:21,330
This coming from the future
president of Keystone Pictures.

63
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:25,301
You know, I can't
really picture her.

64
00:02:25,802 --> 00:02:26,803
Who's Shelley Winters?

65
00:02:26,803 --> 00:02:28,337
Wait. I got it.
She's that actress

66
00:02:28,337 --> 00:02:30,339
that does the poly-denture
commercials, right?

67
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:31,841
Right, right.

68
00:02:31,841 --> 00:02:33,726
And she's married
to that guy who's, like,

69
00:02:33,726 --> 00:02:35,094
what, 20 years
younger than her?

70
00:02:35,344 --> 00:02:37,230
Yeah. Right, right.

71
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:39,065
Stop it. Stop it.

72
00:02:39,065 --> 00:02:41,067
That's Martha Raye,
you idiots.

73
00:02:41,484 --> 00:02:43,569
Shelley Winters.

74
00:02:44,570 --> 00:02:47,156
Winchester '73.

75
00:02:47,156 --> 00:02:48,825
A place in the sun.

76
00:02:49,325 --> 00:02:50,276
Patch of blue.

77
00:02:50,660 --> 00:02:52,245
Lolita.

78
00:02:55,615 --> 00:02:57,700
The Poseidon adventure.

79
00:02:57,700 --> 00:02:58,701
Oh!
Oh!

80
00:02:58,701 --> 00:02:59,502
Sure.
Yeah, yeah.

81
00:02:59,752 --> 00:03:01,671
I've seen that movie.
Yeah.

82
00:03:01,871 --> 00:03:03,840
Yeah, I mean, that was
a very good film, actually.

83
00:03:06,259 --> 00:03:08,261
Sorry I asked.
I was curious.

84
00:03:08,678 --> 00:03:10,596
I apologize.

85
00:03:10,847 --> 00:03:13,216
Never apologize, Moe.
It's a sign of weakness.

86
00:03:13,382 --> 00:03:14,267
Holy shit. Guy,
there's Foster Kane.

87
00:03:14,467 --> 00:03:17,053
Introduce us!
The man is my god!

88
00:03:17,053 --> 00:03:18,971
Guy. They let you
out of the salt mine.

89
00:03:19,355 --> 00:03:20,890
To keep an eye on you, Foster.

91
00:03:22,391 --> 00:03:24,861
Say hello to the boys.

92
00:03:24,861 --> 00:03:25,645
Hey.
How you doing?

93
00:03:25,862 --> 00:03:27,280
Good to meet you.

94
00:03:27,530 --> 00:03:28,531
You're the best.

95
00:03:28,865 --> 00:03:29,949
How's-- how's Buddy?

96
00:03:30,450 --> 00:03:31,951
Well, he's great.
He's great.

97
00:03:31,951 --> 00:03:32,952
I called the other day.

98
00:03:32,952 --> 00:03:33,786
I haven't heard back,
though.

99
00:03:34,370 --> 00:03:35,371
Well, I'll tell him
he owes you a call.

100
00:03:35,872 --> 00:03:38,825
Ok. I appreciate that.
Be seein' you again.

101
00:03:38,825 --> 00:03:39,659
Foster.

102
00:03:39,959 --> 00:03:41,043
Uh, very nice...

103
00:03:41,043 --> 00:03:42,495
Bye-bye.

104
00:03:42,829 --> 00:03:44,914
I love that guy.
He's amazing.

106
00:03:46,382 --> 00:03:48,468
Hey. Hey. Hey.
Who was that again?

107
00:03:48,468 --> 00:03:50,002
That's only the most
powerful, sought-after

108
00:03:50,002 --> 00:03:51,504
director in town.

109
00:03:51,921 --> 00:03:53,506
What, Buddy's paging you now?

110
00:03:53,506 --> 00:03:55,007
excuse me, gentlemen.

111
00:03:58,594 --> 00:03:59,679
What are you doin' here?

112
00:03:59,679 --> 00:04:01,147
What, are you trying
to embarrass me?

113
00:04:01,481 --> 00:04:02,565
No.
No.

114
00:04:02,565 --> 00:04:04,433
He is the prodigal son
of Keystone Pictures.

115
00:04:04,433 --> 00:04:06,435
He is Buddy Ackerman's boy.

116
00:04:06,435 --> 00:04:07,937
He is our ticket in.

117
00:04:07,937 --> 00:04:10,823
So don't blow it
with your stupid questions.

118
00:04:11,157 --> 00:04:12,492
Moe. Moe.
What?

119
00:04:12,692 --> 00:04:13,776
You're not comin' anymore.

120
00:04:13,776 --> 00:04:14,777
Don't bring him anymore.

121
00:04:14,777 --> 00:04:15,862
You can't come anymore.

124
00:04:22,168 --> 00:04:23,169
Ok.

125
00:04:24,170 --> 00:04:25,588
Yeah, what?

126
00:04:25,588 --> 00:04:27,173
Dawn?

127
00:04:27,173 --> 00:04:28,674
It's Guy.

128
00:04:28,674 --> 00:04:30,176
Oh, h--hey.

129
00:04:30,176 --> 00:04:31,677
Hi.

130
00:04:33,179 --> 00:04:35,181
Listen, um...

132
00:04:36,682 --> 00:04:37,683
about the other day.

133
00:04:37,683 --> 00:04:39,185
Sounds like you're
being summoned there.

134
00:04:40,686 --> 00:04:41,604
He's been trying
to reach me all night.

135
00:04:41,604 --> 00:04:44,190
Forget about Buddy.

136
00:04:44,190 --> 00:04:46,192
Can I come over?
I--I think--

137
00:04:46,642 --> 00:04:48,694
I think we
really need to talk.

138
00:04:48,694 --> 00:04:50,196
Not right now, ok?

139
00:04:50,196 --> 00:04:51,647
Um, I--I have
these scripts to read,

140
00:04:51,647 --> 00:04:53,199
and I'm really busy.

141
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:54,200
Oh.

142
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:56,569
Uh... can--can we
do this tomorrow?

143
00:04:59,038 --> 00:05:01,040
Tomorrow.

144
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:02,575
Yeah, all right.

145
00:05:02,575 --> 00:05:03,576
Talk to me.

146
00:05:04,076 --> 00:05:05,077
What is it?

147
00:05:05,077 --> 00:05:06,996
Nothing. I--I...

148
00:05:06,996 --> 00:05:09,582
there's just something
that I want to tell you,

149
00:05:09,582 --> 00:05:13,085
and... uh, i--it can wait
till tomorrow.

151
00:05:14,086 --> 00:05:16,005
Call me in the morning, ok?

152
00:05:16,005 --> 00:05:17,590
I will.

153
00:05:17,590 --> 00:05:19,091
Dawn?

154
00:05:19,091 --> 00:05:21,093
What?

155
00:05:23,512 --> 00:05:25,598
I really am sorry.

156
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:29,101
Ok.

159
00:05:46,502 --> 00:05:47,587
Yeah, what?

160
00:05:47,587 --> 00:05:49,038
Uh, it's Guy.
You beeped?

161
00:05:49,038 --> 00:05:50,039
10 minutes ago.
What took you so fuckin' long?

162
00:05:50,039 --> 00:05:53,593
Ahem, well, I--I had
to get to a phone...

163
00:05:53,593 --> 00:05:55,094
Whatever.
Anyway, is it done?

164
00:05:55,595 --> 00:05:57,597
Yes. I returned every call,
and I left work.

165
00:05:57,597 --> 00:05:58,598
Well, that's good,

166
00:05:58,598 --> 00:06:00,049
because some asshole
complained to Cyrus

167
00:06:00,049 --> 00:06:01,100
that I'm not returnin'
my calls.

168
00:06:01,601 --> 00:06:03,603
I can't afford to have that.
Not now, not ever,

169
00:06:03,603 --> 00:06:05,521
and certainly not when
I'm about to be promoted.

170
00:06:05,521 --> 00:06:07,106
Yes.

171
00:06:07,106 --> 00:06:08,608
Ok. You're right.

172
00:06:08,608 --> 00:06:10,610
And, uh,
it won't happen again.

173
00:06:10,610 --> 00:06:12,612
Christ, you're not
even listening, are you?

174
00:06:13,112 --> 00:06:14,113
I'll tell you, Guy,

175
00:06:14,614 --> 00:06:15,615
I don't think
this is working anymore.

176
00:06:15,615 --> 00:06:17,984
Maybe it's time we reconsider
our relationship.

177
00:06:18,234 --> 00:06:20,820
Reconsider?
What do you mean?

178
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:21,821
We'll talk about it
in the morning.

179
00:06:22,238 --> 00:06:24,323
No, wait a minute.
R-reconsider what, Buddy?

180
00:06:24,824 --> 00:06:26,826
What are you gonna do?
You gonna fire me?

181
00:06:26,826 --> 00:06:29,328
Hold on. I got another call.
Hello? Hello?

182
00:06:29,328 --> 00:06:30,329
It's still me.
Listen,

183
00:06:30,329 --> 00:06:31,831
we couldn't return
a lot of calls today

184
00:06:31,831 --> 00:06:33,833
'cause you've been away.
Now, what do you mean--

185
00:06:34,333 --> 00:06:35,167
Hold on. Shut up.

187
00:07:15,841 --> 00:07:16,342
Guy, listen,

188
00:07:16,842 --> 00:07:18,344
tomorrow morning,
call the phone company,

189
00:07:18,844 --> 00:07:20,796
because all my phones
are fuckin' screwed up!

190
00:07:21,297 --> 00:07:23,265
Cancel the call-waiting crap

191
00:07:23,265 --> 00:07:24,266
and put in 2--

192
00:07:24,266 --> 00:07:26,602
No, 4 extra lines
here at the house.

193
00:07:26,602 --> 00:07:28,888
After you've fixed
the phones,

194
00:07:29,138 --> 00:07:30,222
research who directed

195
00:07:30,222 --> 00:07:32,024
the new slam-a-jam
music video.

196
00:07:32,525 --> 00:07:33,526
It's got this blonde.

197
00:07:34,026 --> 00:07:35,311
Find out who his agent is
and what he's doing next.

198
00:07:35,561 --> 00:07:37,146
And then track down
the blonde.

199
00:07:37,146 --> 00:07:39,148
She's wearing this,
um...

200
00:07:39,148 --> 00:07:41,067
It's like an American flag
kind of thing.

201
00:07:41,367 --> 00:07:44,653
It's draped all over her,
uh...

202
00:07:44,870 --> 00:07:46,455
I don't know what.

203
00:07:46,455 --> 00:07:47,907
Set up a meeting.

204
00:07:47,907 --> 00:07:48,958
She's...

205
00:07:48,958 --> 00:07:50,960
she's really...

206
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:52,828
she's patriotic.

208
00:07:54,997 --> 00:07:56,582
The video was directed
by a she...

209
00:07:56,582 --> 00:07:57,750
What the hell?

210
00:07:57,750 --> 00:07:59,719
...Tracy Janowitz.
And you're a little late.

211
00:07:59,719 --> 00:08:01,337
She signed a 3-picture deal
with Universal.

212
00:08:01,337 --> 00:08:02,254
What the hell?

213
00:08:05,141 --> 00:08:06,926
And as far as the blonde...

214
00:08:07,093 --> 00:08:08,594
What are you doing?

215
00:08:11,097 --> 00:08:12,598
Don't you think
she's a little young...

216
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:14,600
even for you?

217
00:08:15,101 --> 00:08:16,652
What are you doing?

218
00:08:16,652 --> 00:08:18,154
What are you doing here?
Jesus Christ.

219
00:08:18,154 --> 00:08:19,655
You scared the living shit
out of me.

220
00:08:19,655 --> 00:08:21,323
You're lucky
I didn't shoot you.

221
00:08:21,323 --> 00:08:23,242
With what? This?

222
00:08:25,494 --> 00:08:26,529
Oh, great.

223
00:08:26,529 --> 00:08:27,947
My gun. Hand it over.

224
00:08:28,330 --> 00:08:29,782
Sit.

225
00:08:30,082 --> 00:08:31,667
Have you gone
completely insane?

226
00:08:31,667 --> 00:08:34,120
Give me the gun now!

227
00:08:34,420 --> 00:08:37,456
Sit the fuck down
now!

229
00:08:44,847 --> 00:08:47,850
Ok, look, I know things
have been a little crazy

230
00:08:47,850 --> 00:08:49,135
at the office lately,

231
00:08:49,435 --> 00:08:50,436
but there's
no need for this.

232
00:08:50,436 --> 00:08:52,888
Now, why don't you
put down the gun,

233
00:08:52,888 --> 00:08:53,889
and let's talk?

234
00:08:53,889 --> 00:08:55,808
We're both
rational adults here.

235
00:08:56,108 --> 00:08:57,193
Bullshit.

236
00:08:57,693 --> 00:08:59,562
You are a fucking child.

237
00:08:59,945 --> 00:09:02,031
All right, fine. I gave you
a chance, you know.

238
00:09:02,031 --> 00:09:03,449
But it's late, and
I'm tired of this bullshit.

239
00:09:03,449 --> 00:09:05,818
I'm calling the cops,
and you're going to jail.

240
00:09:05,818 --> 00:09:07,236
End of story.
Have a nice life.

241
00:09:15,544 --> 00:09:17,129
What do you want?

242
00:09:24,637 --> 00:09:26,138
I want you...

243
00:09:27,590 --> 00:09:29,141
to think...

244
00:09:30,142 --> 00:09:32,094
and remember...

245
00:09:32,595 --> 00:09:34,597
every insult...

246
00:09:34,597 --> 00:09:37,850
every offense...

247
00:09:38,067 --> 00:09:42,154
everything that you have
ever taken away...

248
00:09:42,154 --> 00:09:44,156
from me.

249
00:09:45,157 --> 00:09:47,159
Think to yourself.

250
00:09:50,663 --> 00:09:52,581
It's payback time.

251
00:09:56,785 --> 00:09:59,038
It's currently
78 degrees in Hollywood,

252
00:09:59,038 --> 00:10:02,041
and it's shapin' up to be
a great weekend, everyone.

253
00:10:02,041 --> 00:10:03,959
'Course, you gotta make it
through the week first,

254
00:10:03,959 --> 00:10:05,928
but if you do,
you can look forward

255
00:10:06,345 --> 00:10:08,430
to the third annual
celebrity tractor pull

256
00:10:08,430 --> 00:10:10,432
at the Pomona fairgrounds
this weekend.

257
00:10:10,432 --> 00:10:11,433
Tickets are--

263
00:10:32,154 --> 00:10:33,038
Hi. How are you?

264
00:10:33,405 --> 00:10:35,324
Fuck you. You're in my spot.
Could you move?

265
00:10:41,630 --> 00:10:42,214
Ok.

266
00:10:45,584 --> 00:10:47,086
Sorry about that.

267
00:10:47,086 --> 00:10:49,388
I didn't realize
that was your spot.

268
00:10:49,388 --> 00:10:51,891
I slaved 3 miserable years
to get that spot.

269
00:10:51,891 --> 00:10:53,392
It's mine. I earned it.

270
00:10:53,392 --> 00:10:55,895
It's a great spot.
As soon as I pulled in,

271
00:10:55,895 --> 00:10:56,896
I thought, "wow,
what a great spot."

272
00:10:57,396 --> 00:10:58,397
I'm Guy, by the way.

273
00:10:58,397 --> 00:11:00,900
What is this, your first day
on the job or something?

274
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:02,902
Yes. Yes. As a matter
of fact, it is.

275
00:11:02,902 --> 00:11:04,403
Yeah, well,
piece of advice.

276
00:11:04,403 --> 00:11:05,404
Lose the smile.

277
00:11:05,404 --> 00:11:06,906
Makes you look
like a schmuck.

282
00:11:21,253 --> 00:11:22,755
Hello.
Buddy Ackerman's office.

283
00:11:23,255 --> 00:11:24,757
Oh, uh,
h-hold on one second.

284
00:11:25,257 --> 00:11:25,758
Here.

285
00:11:26,258 --> 00:11:27,760
Ready to go to work,
I see.

286
00:11:29,261 --> 00:11:29,762
Oh.

288
00:11:31,764 --> 00:11:33,265
Buddy Ackerman's office.

289
00:11:33,766 --> 00:11:35,768
No, Derrick,
he's not here right now.

290
00:11:36,268 --> 00:11:37,770
No, that's not what I said.

291
00:11:38,270 --> 00:11:40,773
I said he's not here right now
at this moment in time.

292
00:11:41,273 --> 00:11:42,775
Mm-hmm.

293
00:11:43,275 --> 00:11:44,777
Gonna miss you, too, Derrick.

295
00:11:46,278 --> 00:11:47,279
Buddy Ackerman's office.

296
00:11:47,780 --> 00:11:49,281
Yes, I know the meeting
has started, ma'am.

297
00:11:49,782 --> 00:11:51,283
I'll send him down
as soon as he gets here.

298
00:11:51,784 --> 00:11:52,284
Thank you.

300
00:11:53,786 --> 00:11:56,238
Buddy Ackerman's--
ooh, hey, Mona.

301
00:11:56,238 --> 00:11:58,290
How are you,
gorgeous?

302
00:11:59,792 --> 00:12:01,293
Of course you and Buddy
are on for tonight.

303
00:12:01,794 --> 00:12:03,796
Just get your cute little butt
over to his place by midnight.

305
00:12:05,297 --> 00:12:06,298
Bye.

306
00:12:06,665 --> 00:12:09,752
So I don't know what
you've heard about this job,

307
00:12:09,752 --> 00:12:12,755
but it's gonna be a lot of work
for shit wages.

308
00:12:12,755 --> 00:12:16,258
A lot of shit work
for shit wages.

309
00:12:16,258 --> 00:12:17,760
Picking up dry-cleaning,

310
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:19,228
gassing up his car,

311
00:12:19,228 --> 00:12:21,764
getting him coffee,
getting him lunch,

312
00:12:21,764 --> 00:12:23,732
and getting him laid.

314
00:12:24,767 --> 00:12:26,769
And he can be, well...

315
00:12:27,186 --> 00:12:28,270
difficult.

316
00:12:28,270 --> 00:12:30,189
In there.
Difficult at times.

317
00:12:30,522 --> 00:12:32,608
After all, Buddy
is the senior executive

318
00:12:32,608 --> 00:12:34,109
vice president of production

319
00:12:34,109 --> 00:12:35,611
for Keystone.

320
00:12:35,611 --> 00:12:37,613
Only 2 people
bigger than that.

321
00:12:37,613 --> 00:12:38,614
Stella Smiley,

322
00:12:38,614 --> 00:12:40,616
President at
World-wide Production...

323
00:12:40,616 --> 00:12:42,117
for now.

324
00:12:42,117 --> 00:12:43,619
She doesn't like us.

325
00:12:43,619 --> 00:12:45,120
Let me write this down.

326
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:46,622
But that's ok--
excuse me.

327
00:12:46,622 --> 00:12:47,623
Oh, I'm sorry.

328
00:12:48,123 --> 00:12:51,093
Because above her
is Cyrus Miles...

329
00:12:51,093 --> 00:12:54,129
studio chairman
and grand poobah.

330
00:12:54,129 --> 00:12:56,048
We call him god.

331
00:12:56,048 --> 00:12:57,633
And he does like us.

332
00:12:57,633 --> 00:12:58,634
That thing is gonna be

333
00:12:58,634 --> 00:13:01,637
the second most important
thing in your life.

334
00:13:01,637 --> 00:13:04,139
I pity the day
it breaks down on you.

335
00:13:04,139 --> 00:13:05,140
Ah.

336
00:13:07,142 --> 00:13:08,143
Oh.

337
00:13:11,730 --> 00:13:12,815
Whew.

338
00:13:12,815 --> 00:13:14,817
Guy, if you do this job well,

339
00:13:15,317 --> 00:13:18,070
wealth and opportunity
are yours.

340
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:19,405
All of Buddy's assistants

341
00:13:19,405 --> 00:13:21,407
have gone on to bigger
and better things.

342
00:13:21,407 --> 00:13:23,409
One is running the Sony Channel.

343
00:13:23,409 --> 00:13:24,410
Another one has produced

344
00:13:24,410 --> 00:13:25,711
all the Macaulay Culkin
action pictures.

345
00:13:25,994 --> 00:13:26,995
Wow.

346
00:13:26,995 --> 00:13:28,580
It's a good lineage.
A legacy.

347
00:13:28,580 --> 00:13:29,548
Fantastic.

348
00:13:29,998 --> 00:13:31,917
If you don't mind me asking,
where are you going?

349
00:13:32,167 --> 00:13:34,219
Vice President of production
at Paramount.

350
00:13:34,586 --> 00:13:37,423
Like I said,
it is a good lineage.

351
00:13:37,639 --> 00:13:40,225
This is the most important
thing in your life.

352
00:13:40,225 --> 00:13:41,093
It works very simple.

353
00:13:41,393 --> 00:13:43,395
Steady green light--
the line is active.

354
00:13:43,846 --> 00:13:45,431
If it's off, it's dead.

355
00:13:45,431 --> 00:13:47,316
Flashing red--
someone's holding.

356
00:13:47,316 --> 00:13:49,151
Flashing green--
incoming.

357
00:13:49,401 --> 00:13:50,986
Flashing green.
Incoming. Yes.

358
00:13:50,986 --> 00:13:51,987
Ok.

359
00:13:51,987 --> 00:13:52,988
Don't worry,

360
00:13:53,405 --> 00:13:54,940
You'll do all right, farm boy.

361
00:13:54,940 --> 00:13:56,408
Actually...uh...

362
00:13:56,909 --> 00:13:59,862
I'm from upstate New York.

363
00:14:00,162 --> 00:14:03,031
There are farms around...

364
00:14:03,031 --> 00:14:04,416
in the area.

365
00:14:04,666 --> 00:14:05,584
Good morning, Mr. Ackerman.

366
00:14:05,834 --> 00:14:08,754
Hello.
Buddy Ackerman's office.

367
00:14:08,954 --> 00:14:10,506
I'm from
a more urban area.

368
00:14:10,506 --> 00:14:11,540
Guy?

369
00:14:11,540 --> 00:14:13,292
So glad to see you here.

370
00:14:13,509 --> 00:14:15,094
I cannot tell you
how grateful I am

371
00:14:15,094 --> 00:14:17,096
that you could start
right away.

372
00:14:17,096 --> 00:14:18,931
It'll be nice to finally get
some real help around here

373
00:14:19,131 --> 00:14:19,715
and get rid
of this mongoloid

374
00:14:20,215 --> 00:14:21,216
so he'll stop
screwing me up

375
00:14:21,216 --> 00:14:23,218
and fuck the competition
for a change, huh?

376
00:14:23,218 --> 00:14:24,720
Our gain is their loss.

378
00:14:25,804 --> 00:14:26,355
What?

379
00:14:26,889 --> 00:14:27,856
Stella's on line 1, Nom's on 2,

380
00:14:27,856 --> 00:14:28,891
and they called
from the stage.

381
00:14:29,391 --> 00:14:30,142
They want to raise the
volume on the final mix.

382
00:14:30,359 --> 00:14:31,443
You get me Rob
on the phone.

383
00:14:31,443 --> 00:14:32,444
He's on 3.

384
00:14:32,945 --> 00:14:34,363
Well, I'll take him.
You tell Stella to hold.

385
00:14:34,696 --> 00:14:35,781
Take my Mom, and when
you're done with her,

386
00:14:35,781 --> 00:14:39,785
west lobby, tube dress,
stiletto heels. Hurry.

387
00:14:39,785 --> 00:14:40,786
Fetch.

388
00:14:40,786 --> 00:14:42,237
Come on, Guy.
You're in for a treat.

389
00:14:42,237 --> 00:14:45,574
Hi, Stella. Yeah,
he'll be right down.

390
00:14:45,574 --> 00:14:47,876
Yo, Rob, listen, I ran
the rough cut last night,

391
00:14:47,876 --> 00:14:50,329
and the mix is still
way too goddamned low.

392
00:14:50,746 --> 00:14:52,331
I told you you gotta
bring up the explosions.

393
00:14:52,831 --> 00:14:53,832
They gotta be
loud, loud, loud!

394
00:14:54,249 --> 00:14:56,218
The audience should feel
their balls tremble.

395
00:14:56,218 --> 00:14:57,553
Their ears should bleed!

396
00:14:57,886 --> 00:14:59,471
So I don't care if God
told you to keep it down,

397
00:14:59,972 --> 00:15:00,839
much less Stella.

398
00:15:01,089 --> 00:15:02,674
What do you mean,
it can't be done?

399
00:15:02,674 --> 00:15:05,060
Que pasa
this "can't be done"?

401
00:15:08,814 --> 00:15:11,099
All right, Rob,
shut up for a second.

402
00:15:11,517 --> 00:15:13,068
Just listen.

403
00:15:13,068 --> 00:15:15,904
All right, let's try
something easier.

404
00:15:16,188 --> 00:15:17,272
Repeat this:

405
00:15:17,272 --> 00:15:20,692
"Would you like that
in a pump or a loafer?"

406
00:15:21,026 --> 00:15:22,861
No, Rob,
just say it with me.

407
00:15:23,078 --> 00:15:24,663
Come on, just humor me.
Just say it once.

408
00:15:25,164 --> 00:15:26,165
Just...

409
00:15:26,165 --> 00:15:28,667
"Would you like that...

410
00:15:28,667 --> 00:15:30,169
"in a pump...

411
00:15:30,169 --> 00:15:31,420
or a loafer?"

412
00:15:34,289 --> 00:15:36,875
Good. Now memorize it,
because as of tomorrow,

413
00:15:37,376 --> 00:15:39,378
the only job you're going
to be able to get

414
00:15:39,878 --> 00:15:41,680
is selling shoes!

415
00:15:51,356 --> 00:15:53,775
Well, I--I, uh--ahem.

416
00:15:54,059 --> 00:15:55,644
Shh, shh, shh.

417
00:15:57,613 --> 00:15:59,648
Rob's calling again
on line one.

418
00:16:04,236 --> 00:16:05,821
Yo, Rob, look,
I'm busy now.

419
00:16:06,238 --> 00:16:07,289
I can't really--

420
00:16:09,241 --> 00:16:11,793
well, I'm glad
you see it my way...

421
00:16:12,327 --> 00:16:13,245
Now.

422
00:16:13,795 --> 00:16:16,331
Hey, look, we all have
our misunderstandings.

423
00:16:16,331 --> 00:16:17,833
Just get it done.

424
00:16:17,833 --> 00:16:19,084
Where's Stella,
and what's my schedule?

425
00:16:19,084 --> 00:16:20,085
She hung up,
and they want you

426
00:16:20,085 --> 00:16:21,053
down in the staff meeting
right away.

427
00:16:21,420 --> 00:16:22,804
They start yet?

428
00:16:23,005 --> 00:16:24,423
No. They've been waiting for you
for about 15 minutes.

429
00:16:24,723 --> 00:16:25,807
Good.

430
00:16:25,807 --> 00:16:28,644
Let me tell you something,
Guy, and learn from this--

431
00:16:28,644 --> 00:16:30,646
if they can't start
a meeting without you,

432
00:16:30,646 --> 00:16:33,649
well, that's a meeting
worth going to, isn't it?

433
00:16:33,649 --> 00:16:35,067
And that's the only kind
of meeting

434
00:16:35,067 --> 00:16:37,152
you should ever
concern yourselves with.

435
00:16:37,152 --> 00:16:38,103
File this!

436
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:40,572
What's next?

437
00:16:40,572 --> 00:16:41,490
Her name is Mitzy.

438
00:16:41,740 --> 00:16:42,324
Mitzy.

439
00:16:42,824 --> 00:16:43,825
I like that.

440
00:16:46,278 --> 00:16:48,664
Ok, let's do it.

441
00:16:49,998 --> 00:16:53,001
Mitzy. Hi.

442
00:16:53,252 --> 00:16:54,336
Buddy Ackerman,
senior executive

443
00:16:54,336 --> 00:16:55,337
vice president
of production.

444
00:16:55,837 --> 00:16:56,538
I couldn't help it.
I saw you

445
00:16:57,122 --> 00:16:57,623
in the lobby
on my way in.

446
00:16:58,123 --> 00:16:59,625
I'm on my way
to an important meeting,

447
00:16:59,625 --> 00:17:02,127
and...I can just tell

448
00:17:02,127 --> 00:17:04,129
that there are
enormous opportunities

449
00:17:04,630 --> 00:17:05,631
for the both of us,

450
00:17:05,631 --> 00:17:07,132
and I will pull myself
out of this meeting

451
00:17:07,132 --> 00:17:09,601
if you can bear
just waiting 10 minutes.

452
00:17:09,601 --> 00:17:12,638
Because I would love it
if you and I can just...

453
00:17:12,638 --> 00:17:14,139
sit and chat.

455
00:17:15,140 --> 00:17:16,558
Would that be possible?

456
00:17:16,558 --> 00:17:17,643
Oh, that's great.

457
00:17:17,643 --> 00:17:19,144
Now, if you need
anything,

458
00:17:19,144 --> 00:17:20,145
you just ask
these 2 boys here. Ok?

459
00:17:20,145 --> 00:17:21,647
Keep her happy.
All right?

460
00:17:21,647 --> 00:17:22,648
Why don't you
just go sit down,

461
00:17:22,648 --> 00:17:23,649
and I'll be right back.

462
00:17:23,649 --> 00:17:25,400
Where's
my fuckin' coffee?

463
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:28,654
Oh, coffee. Coffee,
Coffee. Coffee.

464
00:17:32,157 --> 00:17:33,659
Buddy Ackerman's office.

465
00:17:33,659 --> 00:17:34,660
Can you please hold?

466
00:17:34,660 --> 00:17:36,161
Cream, sugar.
Sweet'n low.

467
00:17:36,628 --> 00:17:37,162
Swee...

468
00:17:39,915 --> 00:17:41,833
guy: sweet'n low,
sweet'n low.

469
00:17:42,134 --> 00:17:43,218
Come on, people!

470
00:17:43,719 --> 00:17:44,219
I'm late
for a meeting here!

471
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:46,722
Let's go, go, go,
go, go, go!

472
00:17:52,811 --> 00:17:54,313
Excuse me.
What is this?

473
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:56,264
Sweet'n low?

474
00:18:00,235 --> 00:18:01,236
No.

475
00:18:01,687 --> 00:18:02,738
This is not sweet'n low.

476
00:18:03,238 --> 00:18:05,741
This is equal.
Blue packet.

477
00:18:05,741 --> 00:18:06,775
Sweet'n low is pink.

478
00:18:07,275 --> 00:18:08,193
See?

479
00:18:08,193 --> 00:18:10,579
Equal--blue.
Sweet'n low--pink.

480
00:18:10,579 --> 00:18:12,914
It's not the same thing,
is it?

481
00:18:13,281 --> 00:18:14,866
Uh, well, I...

482
00:18:14,866 --> 00:18:16,868
I think they both
contain the same--

483
00:18:16,868 --> 00:18:19,588
What equal contains
is not my concern here.

484
00:18:20,122 --> 00:18:22,674
I don't care if it has
fucking fairy dust in it.

486
00:18:27,512 --> 00:18:30,015
What I am concerned with
is detail.

487
00:18:30,015 --> 00:18:33,018
I asked you to go get me
a packet of sweet'n low,

488
00:18:33,018 --> 00:18:35,020
that isn't what I asked for,
that isn't what I wanted,

489
00:18:35,020 --> 00:18:36,471
that isn't what I needed,
and that shit

490
00:18:36,855 --> 00:18:38,440
isn't gonna
work around here.

491
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:39,441
I--I just thought...

492
00:18:39,441 --> 00:18:40,442
You thought.

493
00:18:41,943 --> 00:18:43,945
Do me a fucking favor.

494
00:18:43,945 --> 00:18:46,448
Shut up, listen,
and learn.

495
00:18:46,448 --> 00:18:49,034
Look, I know that
this is your first day

496
00:18:49,034 --> 00:18:51,536
and you don't really know
how things work around here,

497
00:18:51,536 --> 00:18:53,488
so I will tell you.

498
00:18:55,490 --> 00:18:56,992
You...

499
00:18:56,992 --> 00:18:58,994
have...

500
00:18:58,994 --> 00:18:59,995
no...

501
00:18:59,995 --> 00:19:01,997
brain.

502
00:19:01,997 --> 00:19:05,083
No judgment calls
are necessary.

503
00:19:05,083 --> 00:19:07,335
What you think
means nothing.

504
00:19:07,836 --> 00:19:09,337
What you feel
means nothing.

505
00:19:09,805 --> 00:19:11,339
You are here for me.

506
00:19:11,757 --> 00:19:14,342
You are here
to protect my interests

507
00:19:14,342 --> 00:19:15,844
and to serve my needs.

508
00:19:15,844 --> 00:19:19,264
So while it may look like
a little thing to you...

509
00:19:19,648 --> 00:19:22,651
when I ask for a packet
of sweet'n low...

510
00:19:24,736 --> 00:19:26,238
that's what I want.

511
00:19:27,522 --> 00:19:29,908
And it is
your responsibility now

512
00:19:30,192 --> 00:19:32,778
to see that I get
what I want.

513
00:19:33,779 --> 00:19:35,113
Am I clear?

514
00:19:37,949 --> 00:19:39,951
Y-yes, sir.

515
00:19:40,335 --> 00:19:41,920
I'm not trying to be cruel.
I'm just trying to help.

516
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:42,921
Because if you
do this job right,

517
00:19:42,921 --> 00:19:44,423
if you listen and learn,

518
00:19:44,423 --> 00:19:45,340
then you're gonna
be able to do

519
00:19:45,674 --> 00:19:46,258
anything you want
in this town.

520
00:19:46,758 --> 00:19:47,759
You can have
whatever you want.

521
00:19:48,260 --> 00:19:51,346
I mean, look at Rex here.
A V.P. at Paramount. Ha!

522
00:19:51,346 --> 00:19:53,298
"Rex." What a name.
Belongs to a mutt.

523
00:19:53,298 --> 00:19:55,217
I mean, if I can get
dog boy here a job,

524
00:19:55,217 --> 00:19:57,602
you're gonna do
just fine.

526
00:20:02,357 --> 00:20:03,358
I fucked up.

527
00:20:03,358 --> 00:20:05,644
I fuck--fuck!

528
00:20:05,894 --> 00:20:06,478
It's over.

529
00:20:06,978 --> 00:20:07,446
Relax.

530
00:20:07,979 --> 00:20:09,481
He does that a lot.

531
00:20:09,481 --> 00:20:10,782
Tomorrow, he'll ask you
for an equal.

532
00:20:11,366 --> 00:20:11,783
You can't win.

533
00:20:12,367 --> 00:20:14,870
It's a lose-lose
situation.

534
00:20:14,870 --> 00:20:17,789
Well, does it still
happen to you?

535
00:20:18,290 --> 00:20:18,790
Daily.

536
00:20:19,291 --> 00:20:20,742
Actually, hourly.

537
00:20:21,076 --> 00:20:21,626
Look...every day

538
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:24,079
is something
completely different.

539
00:20:24,079 --> 00:20:25,130
Nothing is ever the same.

540
00:20:25,664 --> 00:20:26,498
What he wants,
what he needs

541
00:20:26,715 --> 00:20:28,300
can change in a second.

542
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:30,802
The trick is to have
everything ready.

543
00:20:31,303 --> 00:20:32,637
Anticipate.

544
00:20:32,838 --> 00:20:34,890
Next time, bring back
an equal and a sweet'n low.

545
00:20:34,890 --> 00:20:37,342
Remember,
protect his interests

546
00:20:37,676 --> 00:20:39,761
and serve his needs.

547
00:20:40,262 --> 00:20:42,180
Come on.
Say it with me.

548
00:20:42,180 --> 00:20:44,683
Protect his interests
and serve his needs.

549
00:20:44,683 --> 00:20:46,184
Ok, but that's crazy.

550
00:20:46,184 --> 00:20:48,153
That's no way
to run a business.

551
00:20:48,153 --> 00:20:49,154
Uh-uh.

552
00:20:49,154 --> 00:20:50,655
First mistake.

553
00:20:50,655 --> 00:20:52,574
This is not a business.

554
00:20:52,991 --> 00:20:54,576
No rules here.

555
00:20:54,576 --> 00:20:56,077
This ain't
that candy-striped crap

556
00:20:56,077 --> 00:20:58,363
for the Wall Street
wimps, huh?

557
00:20:58,530 --> 00:20:59,614
This is...

558
00:20:59,614 --> 00:21:01,616
show business.

559
00:21:03,118 --> 00:21:05,620
Punching below the belt
is not only all right...

560
00:21:08,123 --> 00:21:09,624
it is rewarded.

561
00:21:10,959 --> 00:21:13,044
So in this,
this business of show,

562
00:21:13,044 --> 00:21:15,380
you gotta
ask yourself...

563
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:16,765
What is it

564
00:21:17,265 --> 00:21:19,768
that is gonna
make them sit up

565
00:21:19,768 --> 00:21:21,136
and take notice of you?

566
00:21:23,021 --> 00:21:25,357
Work really, really hard.

567
00:21:27,225 --> 00:21:28,727
Don't worry, farm boy.

568
00:21:28,727 --> 00:21:30,729
You'll learn.

569
00:21:30,729 --> 00:21:32,614
Have a cigarette.

570
00:21:32,948 --> 00:21:34,032
I--I don't smoke.

571
00:21:34,533 --> 00:21:35,367
It won't last.

572
00:21:35,567 --> 00:21:37,152
This and that pot
of coffee are gonna be

573
00:21:37,152 --> 00:21:39,070
your best friends
for the next year.

574
00:21:39,070 --> 00:21:40,906
Get to know them.

575
00:21:41,740 --> 00:21:43,575
Come on.
Roll up your sleeves.

576
00:21:43,875 --> 00:21:44,960
We got work to do.

577
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:46,294
Ok.
Let's do it. Hmm?

578
00:21:56,471 --> 00:21:58,807
What do you want?

579
00:22:01,176 --> 00:22:02,644
You are in big trouble.

580
00:22:03,061 --> 00:22:04,646
Start making
funeral arrangements,

581
00:22:04,646 --> 00:22:06,147
because you are dead
in this town.

582
00:22:06,147 --> 00:22:07,098
I am not kidding you.

583
00:22:07,515 --> 00:22:08,099
Apologize.

584
00:22:08,516 --> 00:22:09,517
Excuse me? What?

585
00:22:09,901 --> 00:22:10,819
Ow! Ow!

586
00:22:11,069 --> 00:22:12,153
Ow! My hair!

587
00:22:12,153 --> 00:22:13,939
I want you
to apologize!

588
00:22:14,189 --> 00:22:15,740
For what!

589
00:22:16,107 --> 00:22:18,660
Oh! Ohhh...

590
00:22:19,110 --> 00:22:20,028
Apologize.

591
00:22:21,363 --> 00:22:22,747
Fuck you.

592
00:22:25,033 --> 00:22:27,002
Oh! You...

593
00:22:27,369 --> 00:22:28,253
Fu--

594
00:22:29,838 --> 00:22:30,922
Ooh!

596
00:22:32,924 --> 00:22:35,927
Buddy Ackerman's office.

597
00:22:35,927 --> 00:22:38,680
Um...I d--I don't have
that information,

598
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:40,682
but, I--look...
Let me ask him,

599
00:22:40,682 --> 00:22:43,051
and I'll have him call you--
I'll call you back.

600
00:22:43,351 --> 00:22:43,935
Bye.

601
00:22:44,436 --> 00:22:45,437
Buddy Ackerman's office.

602
00:22:45,937 --> 00:22:46,938
Hank.

603
00:22:46,938 --> 00:22:48,390
Wh--ok, listen.

604
00:22:48,390 --> 00:22:50,442
Is there any way
you can have that delivered

605
00:22:50,442 --> 00:22:52,777
by the end of the day?

606
00:22:53,061 --> 00:22:54,145
Oh, great, great.

607
00:22:54,646 --> 00:22:55,647
Great.
I appreciate it.

608
00:22:55,647 --> 00:22:56,448
Thank you. Bye.

609
00:22:56,865 --> 00:22:57,949
Buddy Ackerman's office.

610
00:22:57,949 --> 00:22:59,451
Pick up the phone,
pick up the phone!

611
00:22:59,451 --> 00:23:00,785
Pick up, pick up,
pick up!

612
00:23:01,069 --> 00:23:02,654
It is in your job description.

613
00:23:02,654 --> 00:23:04,155
Sorry. The phone's
been goin' crazy here.

614
00:23:04,155 --> 00:23:05,657
I don't care.

615
00:23:05,657 --> 00:23:07,409
If I get that answering machine
one more time, I draw blood!

616
00:23:07,626 --> 00:23:09,711
All right.
Today's schedule. Do it.

617
00:23:09,711 --> 00:23:11,713
Ok. You have
a pýtch at 10:30.

618
00:23:11,713 --> 00:23:12,831
No, no, no, no!

619
00:23:12,831 --> 00:23:13,832
How many times
have I told you?

620
00:23:13,832 --> 00:23:15,834
No pitches before 11:00!

621
00:23:16,334 --> 00:23:17,335
We've got too much to do.

622
00:23:17,836 --> 00:23:19,754
I got calls to return.
Cancel whoever it is.

623
00:23:19,754 --> 00:23:21,256
It's with Dawn Lockard.

624
00:23:22,757 --> 00:23:23,758
Oh.

625
00:23:24,259 --> 00:23:25,760
Well, ok.

626
00:23:26,261 --> 00:23:28,263
Um, tell her
I'll be a little late,

627
00:23:28,263 --> 00:23:30,181
and, uh, get me Stella.

628
00:23:30,565 --> 00:23:32,150
Patch her through to me
right away. All right?

629
00:23:32,651 --> 00:23:33,902
All right.

630
00:23:34,102 --> 00:23:35,570
Buddy Ackerman calling.

631
00:23:35,820 --> 00:23:36,404
Yes, I'd--

632
00:23:36,905 --> 00:23:37,739
Hi. I'm here
to see Buddy.

633
00:23:37,989 --> 00:23:39,074
I'm Dawn Lockard.
I'm the producer on...

634
00:23:39,491 --> 00:23:40,575
the lot.

635
00:23:40,575 --> 00:23:42,027
Hi.

636
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:43,945
Hi.

637
00:23:45,163 --> 00:23:46,247
Well, Buddy's
running a little late,

638
00:23:46,247 --> 00:23:47,582
so, uh...

639
00:23:47,949 --> 00:23:49,367
just have a seat.

640
00:23:51,703 --> 00:23:53,204
Uh, y-yes. Fine.

641
00:23:53,204 --> 00:23:55,206
Yes. I'll tell him.

643
00:23:56,207 --> 00:23:57,092
Buddy Ackerman's office.

644
00:23:57,375 --> 00:23:58,927
Yeah. What happened?

645
00:23:58,927 --> 00:24:00,845
Uh, Stella's office
just called.

646
00:24:01,129 --> 00:24:03,548
Uh, she's gonna be
unreachable till Monday.

647
00:24:03,798 --> 00:24:04,883
What do you mean,
unreachable?

648
00:24:05,383 --> 00:24:07,352
Well, evidently,
she's white water rafting

649
00:24:07,769 --> 00:24:09,104
in Colorado
with Tom Cruise.

650
00:24:09,304 --> 00:24:11,890
Yeah? So?
Track her down.

651
00:24:12,357 --> 00:24:13,892
Find out
where she's staying.

652
00:24:14,392 --> 00:24:15,894
Uh, well,
she's rafting.

653
00:24:15,894 --> 00:24:17,395
Well, she's unreachable.

654
00:24:17,896 --> 00:24:19,397
Uh-huh.

655
00:24:19,898 --> 00:24:21,316
I don't see the problem.

656
00:24:21,649 --> 00:24:23,735
She's...rafting...
on the water.

657
00:24:23,735 --> 00:24:25,236
I--I...

658
00:24:25,236 --> 00:24:27,155
I don't imagine
they have phones there.

659
00:24:27,489 --> 00:24:30,458
They have helicopters,
don't they?

660
00:24:30,742 --> 00:24:32,794
Y-yes. I...

661
00:24:33,328 --> 00:24:34,746
I--I suppose they do.

662
00:24:35,130 --> 00:24:36,715
You suppose? Listen,
you little twerp,

663
00:24:36,715 --> 00:24:38,216
I can't spend my day

664
00:24:38,216 --> 00:24:39,551
telling you
how to do your job!

665
00:24:39,751 --> 00:24:41,803
Is he in one of his moods?

666
00:24:41,803 --> 00:24:43,138
Yeah.

667
00:24:43,338 --> 00:24:44,923
It's not brain surgery,
you know? Get me Stella.

668
00:24:45,423 --> 00:24:46,841
And you come back
with "she's unreachable"?

669
00:24:46,841 --> 00:24:47,926
I don't ever wanna hear
that word again.

670
00:24:48,426 --> 00:24:48,927
Get outta my way!

671
00:24:49,344 --> 00:24:50,428
Shut up, listen, learn!

672
00:24:50,428 --> 00:24:52,931
There is no such word as
"unreachable" for this office.

673
00:24:52,931 --> 00:24:54,432
Find her. get her.

674
00:24:54,432 --> 00:24:55,934
I wanna talk to her
by lunch.

675
00:24:55,934 --> 00:24:57,936
- If she's not on the phone-
- Out! Out!

676
00:24:57,936 --> 00:24:58,937
Who do you work for?!

677
00:24:58,937 --> 00:25:00,739
If she's not on the phone
by the time I get back...

678
00:25:00,939 --> 00:25:03,024
Listen, about that
parking spot thing--

679
00:25:03,441 --> 00:25:05,026
Had I known that
you work for Buddy,

680
00:25:05,026 --> 00:25:06,778
I certainly
would have let you...

681
00:25:06,778 --> 00:25:07,779
No. Don't worry about it.
Really.

682
00:25:07,779 --> 00:25:10,081
No. I'm just saying you get
enough shit from him.

683
00:25:10,081 --> 00:25:11,499
You don't need it from me.

684
00:25:11,499 --> 00:25:12,951
Believe me,
I can handle Buddy.

685
00:25:12,951 --> 00:25:15,003
"Unreachable" may work
for other hacks out there,

686
00:25:15,003 --> 00:25:16,004
but not here!

687
00:25:17,956 --> 00:25:20,008
Dawn, excuse me.

688
00:25:20,008 --> 00:25:22,010
I just need to, um,
yell at my mongoloid

689
00:25:22,510 --> 00:25:23,795
brain-dead assistant
for a second.

690
00:25:24,012 --> 00:25:26,097
Get in here!

691
00:25:35,223 --> 00:25:36,641
If you ever use
the fucking word

692
00:25:36,641 --> 00:25:37,725
"unreachable"
in my office again,

693
00:25:37,725 --> 00:25:38,693
I swear to god

694
00:25:39,110 --> 00:25:40,695
I will send you goddamn
through the lobby

695
00:25:40,695 --> 00:25:41,613
in a mail chute.

696
00:25:41,946 --> 00:25:43,531
Don't ever do it again.
You understand?

697
00:25:43,531 --> 00:25:44,532
Now, give me my phone.

698
00:25:45,033 --> 00:25:46,534
If my car phone isn't
put in my car by 4:00,

699
00:25:46,534 --> 00:25:47,535
you are a dead person.

700
00:25:47,535 --> 00:25:48,987
I already did it.

701
00:25:52,540 --> 00:25:53,992
Dawn, gorgeous.

702
00:25:54,325 --> 00:25:55,410
It's been too long.

703
00:25:55,410 --> 00:25:58,413
Get your cute
little butt in here.

704
00:26:00,632 --> 00:26:03,218
Guy, hold all my calls.

705
00:26:16,898 --> 00:26:19,234
Ok, ok.

706
00:26:22,153 --> 00:26:24,239
Dawn, I just don't
think that this pony

707
00:26:24,239 --> 00:26:25,740
is gonna win,
place, or show.

708
00:26:25,740 --> 00:26:26,941
I mean--
even the title,

709
00:26:26,941 --> 00:26:29,527
real life--
it's a real pass.

710
00:26:29,527 --> 00:26:30,995
You need this film, Buddy.

711
00:26:30,995 --> 00:26:32,997
It's an important film
for the 18-to-25ers.

712
00:26:32,997 --> 00:26:34,499
It's a redeeming film.

713
00:26:34,499 --> 00:26:37,001
Uou cannot keep dissing
what they want to see.

714
00:26:37,502 --> 00:26:38,503
Oh, really?
How about that, Guy?

715
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:41,372
You're of that age.
You--you feel dissed?

716
00:26:41,756 --> 00:26:44,209
Well, uh, yeah.
Yeah, sure.

717
00:26:44,509 --> 00:26:47,011
Uh...disillusioned,

718
00:26:47,378 --> 00:26:48,963
dismayed...

719
00:26:51,466 --> 00:26:52,800
disposable.

720
00:26:53,017 --> 00:26:55,520
Yeah, thanks, and this
is too dark, depressing,

721
00:26:55,854 --> 00:26:58,439
and dull. It's not
what people want to see.

722
00:26:58,439 --> 00:26:59,440
And I suppose
that pumped-up,

723
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:00,358
overadrenalized,

724
00:27:00,642 --> 00:27:01,726
male macho
bullshit is.

725
00:27:01,726 --> 00:27:05,697
Excuse me. My male macho
bullshit just broke 180 mil.

726
00:27:05,697 --> 00:27:08,199
The last important film this
studio made peaked at 18.

727
00:27:08,199 --> 00:27:10,535
The one before that didn't
even break double digits.

728
00:27:10,785 --> 00:27:15,123
Dawn, forget about this
lost artsy generation crap.

729
00:27:15,123 --> 00:27:17,992
You've been away
from me too long.

730
00:27:17,992 --> 00:27:20,545
Come back tomyteam,

731
00:27:20,545 --> 00:27:21,963
and we can make
some real movies.

732
00:27:22,297 --> 00:27:24,382
Or I could just go to Stella
with it.

733
00:27:24,382 --> 00:27:25,884
She is, after all,
president of production.

734
00:27:25,884 --> 00:27:26,885
Am I right?

735
00:27:27,302 --> 00:27:29,170
Mm-hmm, for now.
Who called?

736
00:27:29,387 --> 00:27:31,256
Oh, um...

737
00:27:31,472 --> 00:27:32,507
ahem, ok...

738
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:34,309
uh...

739
00:27:34,676 --> 00:27:35,760
Mitch and Cyrus.

740
00:27:36,261 --> 00:27:38,179
Cyrus, and you didn't
put him through?

741
00:27:38,429 --> 00:27:39,814
You--you said hold
all your calls.

742
00:27:40,098 --> 00:27:42,684
Fine. Who else?

743
00:27:42,684 --> 00:27:48,690
Uh...uh, Derek, Mitzi,
and Stella returns.

744
00:27:49,190 --> 00:27:50,191
Stella?

745
00:27:50,575 --> 00:27:52,660
Stella?!

746
00:27:52,660 --> 00:27:53,611
You--you said to hold
all your calls.

747
00:27:53,995 --> 00:27:54,913
I didn't know.

748
00:27:55,280 --> 00:27:56,781
You didn't know?
You didn't hear me

749
00:27:57,198 --> 00:27:58,283
when I said "very
important" this morning?

750
00:27:58,783 --> 00:27:59,951
What good are you?
Do you have a brain?

751
00:28:00,535 --> 00:28:02,036
Do you want
to keep this job?

752
00:28:02,036 --> 00:28:03,922
Shut up, listen, learn!

753
00:28:03,922 --> 00:28:05,290
Fuck your
disappointment!

754
00:28:05,540 --> 00:28:06,624
Fuck your
disillusionment!

755
00:28:06,624 --> 00:28:07,959
And fuck you!
Fuck you!

756
00:28:08,209 --> 00:28:09,794
You are a worthless,
fuckin'--

757
00:28:09,794 --> 00:28:12,547
well, isn't this turning into
an intelligent conversation?

758
00:28:12,797 --> 00:28:14,349
Loud and nasty.

759
00:28:14,349 --> 00:28:16,851
That's the only way it sticks, Dawn.

760
00:28:17,302 --> 00:28:19,854
You did say "hold
all my calls," Buddy.

761
00:28:20,221 --> 00:28:22,190
And I certainly hope
you wouldn't want anyone

762
00:28:22,473 --> 00:28:24,275
to intrude
on our time together.

763
00:28:31,366 --> 00:28:32,367
Mm-hmm.

764
00:28:33,368 --> 00:28:35,286
Find Cyrus, find Stella.

765
00:28:35,620 --> 00:28:37,155
Get them on the phone.
If they aren't on the line

766
00:28:37,155 --> 00:28:40,124
by the time I get back,
you'd better not be here either.

767
00:28:40,408 --> 00:28:41,826
I'll get back to you
about this.

768
00:28:42,076 --> 00:28:43,127
Let me think about it,

769
00:28:43,578 --> 00:28:47,582
and, um...
let's get together soon.

770
00:28:47,915 --> 00:28:50,885
Buddy Ackerman's office calling.

771
00:28:51,169 --> 00:28:53,588
As I was saying--

772
00:28:53,838 --> 00:28:54,922
about that little
misunderstanding,

773
00:28:54,922 --> 00:28:55,840
why don't you let
me make it up to you?

774
00:28:56,140 --> 00:28:57,592
How about lunch?

775
00:28:57,925 --> 00:29:00,511
Thank you, but
I--I really ca--I can't.

776
00:29:01,012 --> 00:29:03,431
Look, I'm gonna be
real blunt here.

777
00:29:03,431 --> 00:29:05,433
As much as I hate it,
I need buddy.

778
00:29:05,433 --> 00:29:07,402
I need my calls
to find their way

779
00:29:07,769 --> 00:29:08,853
onto his phone sheet.
I need my scripts

780
00:29:08,853 --> 00:29:10,071
to go home with him
on the weekends.

781
00:29:10,355 --> 00:29:12,940
In short,
I need you on my side.

782
00:29:12,940 --> 00:29:14,409
See what I'm saying?

783
00:29:14,409 --> 00:29:16,744
I don't want
to be put on hold

784
00:29:16,944 --> 00:29:18,446
over a parking spot,

785
00:29:19,030 --> 00:29:20,915
so why don't we
just try this again?

786
00:29:22,283 --> 00:29:24,168
Hey, how about lunch?

787
00:29:24,452 --> 00:29:27,338
Well...

788
00:29:27,588 --> 00:29:29,540
I'm not allowed
to take lunch.

789
00:29:29,957 --> 00:29:33,378
Um...Buddy...doesn't
believe in it.

790
00:29:33,628 --> 00:29:35,963
Fine. Drinks it is.
Here's my card.

791
00:29:36,180 --> 00:29:39,217
Call me when you're done tonight.
All right?

792
00:29:39,217 --> 00:29:40,551
Tonight?

793
00:29:40,718 --> 00:29:44,272
That's all right with you,
isn't it?

794
00:29:44,272 --> 00:29:45,556
Oh, yeah.

795
00:29:45,857 --> 00:29:50,361
It just seems that a woman
as powerful and as attractive

796
00:29:50,695 --> 00:29:54,198
and as pleasant-natured
as yourself

797
00:29:54,482 --> 00:29:56,868
would be booked up
for tonight.

798
00:29:57,201 --> 00:29:59,570
Well, guess what.
I am now.

799
00:30:01,956 --> 00:30:04,492
You know what?
Piece of advice.

800
00:30:04,876 --> 00:30:05,960
You should talk to him
about the yelling.

801
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:06,961
'Cause it really
kind of makes you look

802
00:30:06,961 --> 00:30:07,829
like a schmuck.

803
00:30:20,007 --> 00:30:21,592
Yeah, some tip.
You ought to be shot

804
00:30:22,093 --> 00:30:23,594
for scaring me
that early in the morning.

805
00:30:23,594 --> 00:30:25,980
The change Stella wants--
it's not me,

806
00:30:26,314 --> 00:30:27,899
although I'm sure
she would like it to be.

807
00:30:28,399 --> 00:30:29,183
Yeah, well,
your sources suck.

808
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:31,486
Anyway, it turns out

809
00:30:31,486 --> 00:30:33,855
that Cyrus' teenage
grandson was whining

810
00:30:34,155 --> 00:30:36,741
about how all of today's films
are made for adults,

811
00:30:36,741 --> 00:30:38,743
how there's nothing
for him and his friends.

812
00:30:39,243 --> 00:30:41,612
So the old man bitched
and moaned to Stella,

813
00:30:41,913 --> 00:30:42,997
and now we gotta go out

814
00:30:42,997 --> 00:30:44,949
and find the next
hippest, hottest thing,

815
00:30:45,283 --> 00:30:47,869
you know, something for the kids.
Isn't that great?

816
00:30:47,869 --> 00:30:49,370
You got anything?

817
00:30:50,872 --> 00:30:55,343
Great. Send it to me.
All right. Bye-bye.

818
00:30:55,343 --> 00:30:56,377
Yeah, what?

819
00:30:56,878 --> 00:30:59,547
Well, I wanted to talk to you
about the phone calls.

820
00:30:59,547 --> 00:31:00,465
No apology necessary.

821
00:31:00,798 --> 00:31:02,383
Everyone's allowed
at least one mistake.

822
00:31:02,383 --> 00:31:04,185
You've used up yours.
Let's not dwell on it.

823
00:31:04,385 --> 00:31:06,971
Well, that's just it.
See, I...

824
00:31:06,971 --> 00:31:08,890
I don't feel
that I made a mistake,

825
00:31:09,307 --> 00:31:11,893
and...

826
00:31:11,893 --> 00:31:15,279
Well, I would appreciate it
if you didn't yell at me

827
00:31:15,279 --> 00:31:18,699
in front
of the entire office.

828
00:31:18,699 --> 00:31:20,985
Excuse me. What?

829
00:31:20,985 --> 00:31:23,538
Uh...the--the yelling.

830
00:31:23,538 --> 00:31:24,489
Uh...

831
00:31:29,377 --> 00:31:30,878
Oh.

832
00:31:31,879 --> 00:31:34,549
You...disapprove.

833
00:31:38,136 --> 00:31:39,220
I'm sorry.

834
00:31:41,222 --> 00:31:42,723
Did I...

835
00:31:44,725 --> 00:31:45,927
did I hurt your feelings?

836
00:31:46,260 --> 00:31:49,347
No. No, no.

837
00:31:49,847 --> 00:31:52,817
Uh...I...

838
00:31:52,817 --> 00:31:54,769
I just don't feel
that it's necessary.

839
00:31:55,069 --> 00:31:57,655
It certainly doesn't help me,
and I think that--

840
00:31:57,655 --> 00:31:59,073
well, I'm glad
you brought this up.

841
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:01,359
Great. Great.

842
00:32:01,609 --> 00:32:05,196
'Cause I've found that
an office can't run...

843
00:32:06,697 --> 00:32:10,201
properly if the lines
of communication aren't open.

844
00:32:10,701 --> 00:32:12,203
Right, right, yes.

845
00:32:12,203 --> 00:32:14,205
So, in that case...

846
00:32:17,675 --> 00:32:19,210
let's make
a few things clear.

847
00:32:19,710 --> 00:32:22,263
Ok, great, great.
No, this--this is helpful.

848
00:32:22,763 --> 00:32:23,548
I mean...

849
00:32:23,714 --> 00:32:25,766
let's review.

850
00:32:25,766 --> 00:32:29,937
What did I tell you
the first day?

851
00:32:29,937 --> 00:32:32,356
Your thoughts are nothing.

852
00:32:32,773 --> 00:32:34,358
You are nothing.

853
00:32:34,358 --> 00:32:36,277
And yet you have the nerve

854
00:32:36,277 --> 00:32:37,278
to walk into my office

855
00:32:37,695 --> 00:32:38,779
and tell me--
I--

856
00:32:39,280 --> 00:32:40,281
Please shut up.

857
00:32:40,281 --> 00:32:41,732
At least allow me
the courtesy

858
00:32:42,066 --> 00:32:43,651
of finishing
what I have to say.

859
00:32:43,651 --> 00:32:45,152
That's the very least
that you can do

860
00:32:45,152 --> 00:32:46,904
after I've had to endure
your insults.

861
00:32:47,154 --> 00:32:48,239
This is a bad time.

862
00:32:48,239 --> 00:32:50,708
Who do you think you are,
you snot-faced little punk?

863
00:32:51,042 --> 00:32:52,577
Let me make this clear
for you, ok?!

864
00:32:52,577 --> 00:32:54,128
And now try to follow me,

865
00:32:54,128 --> 00:32:55,129
because I'm gonna be moving

866
00:32:55,630 --> 00:32:56,998
in a kind of circular motion,

867
00:32:57,298 --> 00:33:00,718
so if you pay attention,
there will be a point!

868
00:33:00,968 --> 00:33:02,553
You are nothing!

869
00:33:03,054 --> 00:33:04,589
If you were
in my toilet bowl,

870
00:33:04,589 --> 00:33:05,556
I wouldn't bother
flushing it.

871
00:33:05,923 --> 00:33:08,259
My bath mat means
more to me than you.

872
00:33:08,476 --> 00:33:09,560
You see this?

873
00:33:10,061 --> 00:33:13,064
This means more
to the office than you.

874
00:33:13,064 --> 00:33:15,433
And yet do you hear
any complaints

875
00:33:15,733 --> 00:33:16,601
when I do this?

876
00:33:16,767 --> 00:33:17,768
These pencils,
more important!

877
00:33:18,185 --> 00:33:19,070
These pens,
more important!

878
00:33:19,270 --> 00:33:20,988
These paper clips,
more important!

879
00:33:21,239 --> 00:33:22,857
You miserable
little crybaby!

880
00:33:23,074 --> 00:33:24,108
You don't like it here, leave!

881
00:33:24,492 --> 00:33:25,576
There are thousands of people

882
00:33:25,576 --> 00:33:26,577
who would kill for your spot!

883
00:33:26,577 --> 00:33:28,696
Who would kill for
the opportunity to be here!

884
00:33:28,696 --> 00:33:30,197
I could spit
and hit somebody

885
00:33:30,197 --> 00:33:31,699
who could do this job
better than you!

886
00:33:31,699 --> 00:33:32,700
This is the fast track
to the top, boy.

887
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:34,835
I don't see you breaking
any speed records!

888
00:33:34,835 --> 00:33:37,838
Why can't you show
a little backbone, huh? Huh?

889
00:33:38,089 --> 00:33:40,958
"I don't think the yelling
is necessary."

890
00:33:41,208 --> 00:33:43,261
You gotta be a little more
thick-skinned, you turd.

891
00:33:43,261 --> 00:33:45,012
You gotta be a man
to do this job!

893
00:33:53,020 --> 00:33:54,772
"Talk to him about the yelling."

894
00:33:54,772 --> 00:33:55,773
Thanks.
That was a good tip.

895
00:33:56,274 --> 00:33:57,725
You gotta give
action to get action.

896
00:33:58,059 --> 00:34:00,645
So, Guy,
what's your story?

897
00:34:00,645 --> 00:34:02,613
Is your uncle Bob
in the business?

898
00:34:02,613 --> 00:34:05,116
Or are you just another
boy out for quick cash,

899
00:34:05,116 --> 00:34:06,450
quick cars,
and an easy lay?

900
00:34:06,784 --> 00:34:08,869
You hate me.
Is that it?

901
00:34:09,370 --> 00:34:10,738
Y-you really hate me.

902
00:34:10,988 --> 00:34:12,990
No, I'm just feeling
extra charitable.

904
00:34:15,993 --> 00:34:18,579
So, talk. Amuse me.
What's your story?

905
00:34:18,996 --> 00:34:21,082
I'm a recent
film school graduate

906
00:34:21,082 --> 00:34:25,586
with fairly disappointed
middle-class parents,

907
00:34:25,586 --> 00:34:27,888
uh...who had hoped
their--their son

908
00:34:28,089 --> 00:34:29,173
would have been
anything but a writer.

909
00:34:29,674 --> 00:34:31,175
Oh, you're a writer?
Really?

910
00:34:31,676 --> 00:34:32,176
Yeah.

911
00:34:32,677 --> 00:34:33,678
Why, then, pray tell,

912
00:34:33,678 --> 00:34:35,479
are you fetching coffee
for Buddy Ackerman?

913
00:34:35,680 --> 00:34:38,766
Fetching? I'm...

914
00:34:38,766 --> 00:34:40,267
I'm not fetching.

915
00:34:40,267 --> 00:34:44,155
He--he's one of the top studio
executives in the business.

916
00:34:44,438 --> 00:34:45,523
I'm his--his assistant.

917
00:34:45,523 --> 00:34:47,024
So, basically, you're
substituting talent

918
00:34:47,024 --> 00:34:48,859
with liberal amounts
of ass kissing, right?

919
00:34:49,076 --> 00:34:51,162
Ok.

920
00:34:51,162 --> 00:34:52,663
Well...

921
00:34:52,663 --> 00:34:54,532
I've taken
just about enough

922
00:34:54,832 --> 00:34:56,417
character assassination
for one day. Yhank you for--

923
00:34:56,417 --> 00:34:58,419
Would you please sit down?

924
00:34:58,419 --> 00:34:59,920
Sit.

925
00:35:02,923 --> 00:35:05,292
Look, if this time can be spent
convincing you

926
00:35:05,593 --> 00:35:07,178
to do anything else
with your life,

927
00:35:07,678 --> 00:35:09,180
to getting out while you
are still whole,

928
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:11,048
it is time well spent.

929
00:35:11,382 --> 00:35:13,968
Let me ask you
a question.

930
00:35:13,968 --> 00:35:16,303
Why do you want this?

931
00:35:16,687 --> 00:35:19,273
I don't know.
It's just something

932
00:35:19,273 --> 00:35:20,191
that I have always
wanted to do.

933
00:35:20,524 --> 00:35:22,610
Oh, bullshit.
Is it the money?

934
00:35:22,610 --> 00:35:25,112
There are easier ways
to get rich. girls?

935
00:35:25,112 --> 00:35:27,114
Hey, I'll float you a bill

936
00:35:27,114 --> 00:35:28,532
and give you a number
to call right now.

937
00:35:28,899 --> 00:35:29,984
Why the movies?

938
00:35:29,984 --> 00:35:30,868
Do you really want to know?

939
00:35:31,152 --> 00:35:32,570
I really want to know.

940
00:35:32,787 --> 00:35:34,705
Are you gonna form
some conclusion?

941
00:35:34,955 --> 00:35:35,539
No, I really want to know.

942
00:35:35,990 --> 00:35:36,707
Do you really want to know?

943
00:35:36,957 --> 00:35:37,825
I want to know.

944
00:35:38,409 --> 00:35:40,294
Well, fine. Memories.

945
00:35:40,578 --> 00:35:42,163
Memories?

946
00:35:42,580 --> 00:35:46,584
Yes. All my favorite memories
have been of movies.

947
00:35:46,884 --> 00:35:49,470
For instance,
my first...job.

948
00:35:49,470 --> 00:35:51,255
Summer of '88, Indiana Jones
and the Last Crusade.

949
00:35:51,472 --> 00:35:54,925
My first car, the summer
that rancho del rio opened.

950
00:35:55,226 --> 00:35:57,178
A fine Buddy Ackerman film,
I might add.

951
00:35:57,478 --> 00:35:58,979
What about your first kiss?

952
00:36:03,818 --> 00:36:04,819
Uh...

953
00:36:05,236 --> 00:36:06,821
Summer of 1979.

954
00:36:06,821 --> 00:36:08,689
The fish
that Saved Pittsburgh.

955
00:36:08,939 --> 00:36:10,825
What was her name?

956
00:36:11,075 --> 00:36:13,160
I don't remember.

957
00:36:13,160 --> 00:36:16,163
But Gabe Kaplan's hair
in that movie was amazing.

958
00:36:16,163 --> 00:36:17,998
The only white man
I've ever seen with an Afro.

960
00:36:21,502 --> 00:36:24,588
Wow. A smile.

961
00:36:24,588 --> 00:36:26,590
Maybe you don't hate me.

962
00:36:26,590 --> 00:36:27,541
Wow.

963
00:36:27,875 --> 00:36:29,460
Get over yourself.

964
00:36:29,460 --> 00:36:32,379
Let me give you
a piece of advice here.

965
00:36:32,379 --> 00:36:35,349
If you want to make it
in this business,

966
00:36:35,599 --> 00:36:38,185
you don't have room
for a personal life,

967
00:36:38,185 --> 00:36:39,053
much less
a relationship.

968
00:36:39,353 --> 00:36:41,388
Absolutely
no relationships, no.

969
00:36:41,806 --> 00:36:44,141
Absolutely
no relationships.

971
00:36:47,862 --> 00:36:48,863
Hi. This is Guy.

972
00:36:48,863 --> 00:36:49,864
Leave me a message.

974
00:36:51,315 --> 00:36:53,367
Michelle, stop it.
I'm on the phone.

975
00:36:53,367 --> 00:36:54,869
All right?
I'll be right there.

976
00:36:55,369 --> 00:36:57,872
Guy, hey,
I just wanted to call

977
00:36:57,872 --> 00:37:00,374
and say I think today's talk
was very helpful,

978
00:37:00,374 --> 00:37:02,376
at least for me,
which is great,

979
00:37:02,877 --> 00:37:05,880
Especially at this critical
juncture in our relationship.

980
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:07,381
Good thinking.

981
00:37:07,381 --> 00:37:09,383
Anyway, tomorrow morning
on your way in

982
00:37:09,383 --> 00:37:10,384
I need you to stop off

983
00:37:10,384 --> 00:37:12,887
and pick up
a prescription for me.

984
00:37:12,887 --> 00:37:16,891
It's some pretty sensitive stuff,
so keep it quiet.

985
00:37:16,891 --> 00:37:19,894
Try not to screw up.
It's a top priority.

986
00:37:19,894 --> 00:37:21,395
Don't fail me.

988
00:37:24,732 --> 00:37:27,234
Sorry, Dawn.
I had to take that.

989
00:37:27,234 --> 00:37:30,237
So, dinner tonight.

990
00:37:30,237 --> 00:37:32,156
Ok.

991
00:37:32,156 --> 00:37:34,024
Your place?

992
00:37:36,610 --> 00:37:37,361
You're happy!

993
00:37:37,578 --> 00:37:38,662
I hate that.

994
00:37:38,662 --> 00:37:40,948
Get me packed up now.
I need to get to services.

995
00:37:41,248 --> 00:37:42,333
I gotta go.

996
00:37:44,835 --> 00:37:47,705
What services?
Who died?

997
00:37:49,006 --> 00:37:50,508
No one...yet.

998
00:37:50,508 --> 00:37:53,427
It's Yom Kippur,
you idiot.

999
00:37:53,761 --> 00:37:56,847
Oh. I--I didn't realize
Ackerman was a jewish name.

1000
00:37:56,847 --> 00:37:58,349
It's jewish enough,

1001
00:37:58,349 --> 00:38:00,134
especially when the big
players are involved.

1002
00:38:00,351 --> 00:38:02,937
Besides, I feel a sudden
need to atone for my sins.

1005
00:38:06,524 --> 00:38:07,525
Marie call?

1006
00:38:07,525 --> 00:38:09,527
Marie?
Uh, yes, she did.

1007
00:38:09,527 --> 00:38:11,529
She'll be at your place
at midnight.

1008
00:38:11,946 --> 00:38:13,898
Great, great.

1009
00:38:16,784 --> 00:38:18,285
Buddy.

1010
00:38:18,285 --> 00:38:19,787
Yeah.

1011
00:38:19,787 --> 00:38:22,790
I wanted to talk to you
about Dawn's project.

1012
00:38:23,290 --> 00:38:24,708
Oh, yeah, she's got a great one,

1013
00:38:24,708 --> 00:38:25,793
doesn't she?

1014
00:38:25,793 --> 00:38:28,295
Yeah. Yeah.

1015
00:38:28,295 --> 00:38:30,798
No, a-actually I w--
I wanted to talk to you

1016
00:38:30,798 --> 00:38:32,132
about Dawn's project
real life.

1018
00:38:33,968 --> 00:38:36,971
Now...I think it has a lot
of potential. I really do.

1020
00:38:38,339 --> 00:38:40,424
It's young, it's--it's hot.

1021
00:38:40,424 --> 00:38:42,426
And it could be exactly
what Cyrus is looking for,

1022
00:38:42,426 --> 00:38:44,428
and I was thinking we get
somebody really big to direct,

1023
00:38:44,428 --> 00:38:46,931
maybe...Penny Marshall.

1024
00:38:47,314 --> 00:38:49,400
What?! Shut up,
listen, and learn!

1025
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:52,236
Avoid women directors.
They ovulate.

1026
00:38:52,436 --> 00:38:53,520
Do you have any idea
what that does

1027
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:54,355
to a 3-month shoot?

1028
00:38:54,655 --> 00:38:57,024
I mean, do I need
to say more? Next?

1029
00:38:57,241 --> 00:39:01,328
Ok, uh, well, what about Altman?
Altman could do it.

1030
00:39:01,745 --> 00:39:02,830
Altman? that hack
couldn't direct his way

1031
00:39:02,830 --> 00:39:03,831
out of a paper bag.

1032
00:39:03,831 --> 00:39:05,332
You want to talk
big directors,

1033
00:39:05,332 --> 00:39:06,834
think Attenborough,
think Spielberg,

1034
00:39:06,834 --> 00:39:08,786
think Lean.

1035
00:39:12,172 --> 00:39:13,207
Lean's dead.

1036
00:39:13,207 --> 00:39:14,124
No, he's not.

1037
00:39:14,508 --> 00:39:16,093
Don't you ever say that.

1038
00:39:16,093 --> 00:39:18,512
He's just...unavailable.

1039
00:39:18,846 --> 00:39:21,432
Did you get the stuff?

1040
00:39:21,432 --> 00:39:22,933
Oh, yes, the stuff.

1041
00:39:22,933 --> 00:39:23,934
I put it in the cabinet
under the sink.

1042
00:39:24,351 --> 00:39:25,936
It's in a brown paper bag.

1043
00:39:25,936 --> 00:39:27,888
No, no, no, no, no,
it doesn't belong there.

1044
00:39:28,222 --> 00:39:29,773
No, no, no.

1046
00:39:31,442 --> 00:39:33,811
Great. Great. File this.

1047
00:39:35,562 --> 00:39:36,614
Rogaine.

1048
00:39:36,614 --> 00:39:38,065
But you're not
losing your hair.

1049
00:39:38,482 --> 00:39:41,402
Exactly. Anticipate.

1050
00:39:41,652 --> 00:39:43,737
All right, listen,
about Dawn's project--

1051
00:39:44,154 --> 00:39:45,572
it's not a movie,
it--it's a cause.

1052
00:39:45,572 --> 00:39:47,574
Even the title,
real life?

1053
00:39:47,574 --> 00:39:49,576
All those speeches
and pronouncements.

1054
00:39:49,994 --> 00:39:51,578
That is not what
people want to see,

1055
00:39:51,578 --> 00:39:53,380
much less pay to see.
don't ever forget--

1056
00:39:53,580 --> 00:39:55,666
we are in the business
of developing

1057
00:39:55,666 --> 00:39:57,668
people's dreams,
not damning them.

1058
00:39:57,668 --> 00:39:59,670
Besides, Cyrus has already
found the next new thing,

1059
00:40:00,137 --> 00:40:03,173
this young hot director,
this fuckin' Foster Kane.

1060
00:40:03,173 --> 00:40:04,675
Picture did very well at
the box office last weekend,

1061
00:40:04,675 --> 00:40:06,176
and Stella's
already wooed him.

1062
00:40:06,176 --> 00:40:07,678
She's got him, not us.
We're fucked. We're fucked!

1063
00:40:08,062 --> 00:40:10,931
Well, uh, y-you still got
that article in time.

1064
00:40:11,148 --> 00:40:13,684
What article?

1065
00:40:16,153 --> 00:40:20,407
It's that article on--on--
on violence in--in cinema.

1066
00:40:20,607 --> 00:40:24,194
It calls you "the king
of wham-bam action."

1067
00:40:25,663 --> 00:40:27,665
Yeah, right here.

1068
00:40:27,665 --> 00:40:29,700
Why does nobody
tell me these things?

1069
00:40:29,700 --> 00:40:31,201
I put it on your desk
this morning.

1070
00:40:31,201 --> 00:40:33,120
Who gave them
this picture?

1071
00:40:33,454 --> 00:40:35,506
Oh, Jesus Christ.

1072
00:40:35,506 --> 00:40:36,373
Where do they get these lies?

1073
00:40:36,674 --> 00:40:37,758
Listen to this crap.

1074
00:40:38,258 --> 00:40:39,677
I'm "a blight on society"?

1075
00:40:40,010 --> 00:40:41,095
This has got Stella
written all over it.

1076
00:40:41,545 --> 00:40:42,429
These are
her fingerprints.

1077
00:40:42,680 --> 00:40:45,549
Fine. That bitch wants a war,
she'll get one.

1078
00:40:45,549 --> 00:40:46,350
Tomorrow morning,

1079
00:40:46,850 --> 00:40:47,851
fire the fuckin'
publicity department.

1080
00:40:47,851 --> 00:40:49,303
You got plans tonight?
Uh...

1081
00:40:49,720 --> 00:40:50,637
Cancel 'em.

1082
00:40:50,938 --> 00:40:53,023
I'm sorry, Buddy,
I can't. I--I h--

1083
00:40:53,023 --> 00:40:53,941
not for nothin', Guy.

1084
00:40:54,274 --> 00:40:56,860
You want to make
Dawn's project fly?

1085
00:40:57,361 --> 00:40:59,363
Go ahead,
put it together.

1086
00:40:59,363 --> 00:41:00,114
Let's see
what you can do.

1087
00:41:00,397 --> 00:41:01,482
Really?

1088
00:41:01,899 --> 00:41:03,984
Yeah. But first we need
to bury this article.

1089
00:41:03,984 --> 00:41:05,486
This kid reads I'm
"a blight on society,"

1090
00:41:05,486 --> 00:41:06,987
Forget it, forget you,
forget me,

1091
00:41:06,987 --> 00:41:07,955
forget the expense
account.

1092
00:41:08,322 --> 00:41:09,406
We're out, out, out!

1093
00:41:09,406 --> 00:41:12,242
You need to find
every copy in town

1094
00:41:12,543 --> 00:41:13,627
and destroy it.

1095
00:41:15,629 --> 00:41:16,497
Every copy?

1096
00:41:16,797 --> 00:41:20,384
Yeah. Every copy.
Find it, bury it.

1097
00:41:20,884 --> 00:41:23,253
But it...it's
time magazine.

1098
00:41:23,637 --> 00:41:25,723
It'd be probably hard
to get every copy.

1099
00:41:25,723 --> 00:41:26,507
Yeah? So?

1100
00:41:26,724 --> 00:41:29,143
Find a way. Do it.
Figure it out.

1101
00:41:31,311 --> 00:41:32,896
My briefcase, you idiot!

1102
00:41:33,397 --> 00:41:34,181
I'm sorry.

1103
00:41:34,431 --> 00:41:35,516
It's all in there.

1104
00:41:35,516 --> 00:41:37,017
Jesus Christ.

1105
00:41:39,436 --> 00:41:42,856
Dawn, I'm--I'm sorry, but I--

1106
00:41:43,323 --> 00:41:44,825
of course I want
to be there, but I can't.

1107
00:41:44,825 --> 00:41:46,193
I have to work.

1108
00:41:46,410 --> 00:41:48,495
Please...try to understand.

1110
00:41:49,496 --> 00:41:50,364
I have to go.
I have another call.

1111
00:41:50,664 --> 00:41:52,249
Buddy Ackerman's office.

1112
00:41:52,750 --> 00:41:54,752
Oh, good. You're still there.
Listen.

1113
00:41:54,752 --> 00:41:56,253
You gotta stick around
and tape this interview

1114
00:41:56,253 --> 00:41:57,254
with Foster Kane
tonight.

1115
00:41:57,254 --> 00:41:58,756
It's on CNN, 11:00.

1116
00:41:59,173 --> 00:42:00,174
It's very,
very important.

1117
00:42:00,507 --> 00:42:02,009
We have gotta find
a project for this kid.

1118
00:42:02,426 --> 00:42:03,510
You got it?

1119
00:42:09,516 --> 00:42:10,384
Hello.

1120
00:42:10,684 --> 00:42:12,269
I got it.

1121
00:42:12,269 --> 00:42:15,773
Great. Now, did you get
rid of all the articles?

1122
00:42:15,773 --> 00:42:17,524
I'm just throwin' out
the last copies now.

1123
00:42:17,724 --> 00:42:19,276
No, no, no. You can't
just throw them out.

1124
00:42:19,276 --> 00:42:20,277
You have to destroy them.

1125
00:42:20,644 --> 00:42:22,696
Rip them up,
every copy.

1126
00:42:22,696 --> 00:42:25,732
Well...

1127
00:42:25,732 --> 00:42:28,235
It's just that
it's gettin' kind of late.

1128
00:42:28,235 --> 00:42:30,704
I know, I know.
things are rough now,

1129
00:42:31,155 --> 00:42:33,740
But they'll get better.
I promise, Guy.

1130
00:42:33,740 --> 00:42:36,243
If you prove you can
manage these tasks,

1131
00:42:36,243 --> 00:42:39,246
if you work hard now,
then you're rewarded.

1132
00:42:39,246 --> 00:42:41,248
You get to have some fun,

1133
00:42:41,248 --> 00:42:42,666
because
don't ever forget,

1134
00:42:42,666 --> 00:42:49,756
this job is
very big on payback.

1135
00:42:54,595 --> 00:42:58,315
God, what do you want?

1136
00:42:58,599 --> 00:43:02,686
You sick, twisted fuck,

1137
00:43:02,686 --> 00:43:04,521
why are you doing this?

1138
00:43:04,822 --> 00:43:06,907
This is so cool.

1139
00:43:07,324 --> 00:43:09,910
I saw this in a movie once.

1140
00:43:09,910 --> 00:43:13,247
Matter of fact,
it was one of yours, I think.

1149
00:43:37,521 --> 00:43:39,556
This isn't
gonna fix things.

1150
00:43:40,107 --> 00:43:43,560
This isn't gonna help
any of your problems.

1151
00:43:43,977 --> 00:43:46,029
You're right.

1152
00:43:46,029 --> 00:43:49,566
But it makes me feel
so much better.

1156
00:44:06,833 --> 00:44:07,918
Is this good?

1157
00:44:07,918 --> 00:44:10,721
This ought to loosen up
the chicks, right?

1158
00:44:11,972 --> 00:44:13,473
Let me ask your opinion.

1159
00:44:13,473 --> 00:44:14,975
What is the best
gettin'-laid music?

1160
00:44:14,975 --> 00:44:17,394
I mean...I mean,
the Carpenters

1161
00:44:17,761 --> 00:44:19,846
and that kind of stuff,
just, it--

1162
00:44:19,846 --> 00:44:22,316
it just puts 'em
right to sleep. You know.

1163
00:44:22,316 --> 00:44:24,351
Well, let's--let's--
let's just suppose.

1164
00:44:24,351 --> 00:44:28,355
Let's suppose somebody were
to come over here tonight.

1165
00:44:28,355 --> 00:44:29,356
Just suppose.

1166
00:44:31,491 --> 00:44:33,577
Am I boring you?

1167
00:44:33,577 --> 00:44:35,579
I'm sorry.

1168
00:44:35,579 --> 00:44:39,249
What was it you...
you said about me once?

1169
00:44:39,249 --> 00:44:41,285
"The personality
of a roof shingle"?

1170
00:44:41,285 --> 00:44:43,787
Ha ha ha!
Oh, that was good.

1171
00:44:44,254 --> 00:44:45,289
That was funny.

1172
00:44:45,289 --> 00:44:47,291
Everybody laughed.

1173
00:44:47,674 --> 00:44:50,210
Ohh...well...

1174
00:44:50,761 --> 00:44:53,263
I don't want to bore you,

1175
00:44:53,263 --> 00:44:55,766
so let's get back to work.

1176
00:44:58,769 --> 00:45:01,855
Ahh, gotta be one
in here somewhere.

1177
00:45:01,855 --> 00:45:03,357
Every kitchen drawer
has one.

1179
00:45:07,361 --> 00:45:09,363
You know, it's funny.

1180
00:45:09,363 --> 00:45:12,866
I only dreamt
about doing these things

1181
00:45:12,866 --> 00:45:15,369
all those lonely nights
in the office,

1182
00:45:15,369 --> 00:45:17,371
all those weekends,

1183
00:45:17,871 --> 00:45:22,876
playing out all these torture
scenarios in my head.

1184
00:45:22,876 --> 00:45:26,246
Thinking about it
again...and again.

1185
00:45:32,469 --> 00:45:38,175
You can't imagine
what I've come up with.

1186
00:45:38,175 --> 00:45:40,677
Whatever you're
thinking of doing...

1187
00:45:42,179 --> 00:45:44,564
please don't.

1188
00:45:44,898 --> 00:45:45,932
Shh.

1189
00:45:53,657 --> 00:45:55,242
Paper cuts.

1190
00:45:55,242 --> 00:45:58,245
Now, they can be a bitch.

1191
00:45:58,245 --> 00:46:00,697
Occupational hazard,
I guess.

1192
00:46:01,114 --> 00:46:05,168
But I'll bet it's been a while
since you've had one, huh?

1193
00:46:05,168 --> 00:46:06,203
Me?

1194
00:46:07,704 --> 00:46:10,707
I'm startin'
to get used to 'em.

1195
00:46:19,466 --> 00:46:21,468
Ohh!

1196
00:46:21,968 --> 00:46:23,970
God.

1197
00:46:26,973 --> 00:46:28,775
Stings, doesn't it?

1198
00:46:28,975 --> 00:46:30,027
Well...

1199
00:46:30,560 --> 00:46:33,063
like I said,
you'll get used to 'em.

1200
00:46:33,063 --> 00:46:36,066
Now, the ones that
I could never handle...

1201
00:46:38,068 --> 00:46:39,069
Say "ahh."

1202
00:46:39,069 --> 00:46:40,570
Come on, don't!

1203
00:46:40,570 --> 00:46:43,073
You're only gonna make it
harder on yourself.

1204
00:46:43,073 --> 00:46:48,078
Forget about the shitty
mint flavor on these things.

1205
00:46:48,078 --> 00:46:53,583
The real pain in the ass
is when you get a paper cut...

1206
00:46:53,583 --> 00:46:54,584
on your tongue.

1207
00:46:55,085 --> 00:46:56,086
No.

1208
00:46:58,555 --> 00:47:00,390
Aah!

1210
00:47:05,762 --> 00:47:07,764
Buddy Ackerman's office.

1211
00:47:07,764 --> 00:47:09,566
Hello, Mishka.

1212
00:47:09,566 --> 00:47:11,151
No, he's not in.

1213
00:47:11,151 --> 00:47:16,907
Mishka, Buddy is
devoted to only you.

1214
00:47:17,107 --> 00:47:18,191
Well, I'll tell you
what you do.

1215
00:47:18,191 --> 00:47:21,194
Get your cute little butt
over to his house by midnight.

1216
00:47:21,194 --> 00:47:22,696
Ok.

1217
00:47:22,696 --> 00:47:24,698
Bye-bye.

1219
00:47:30,837 --> 00:47:33,340
This could be the biggest
picture of the year--

1220
00:47:33,840 --> 00:47:36,426
real life,
directed by Foster Kane.

1221
00:47:36,426 --> 00:47:39,930
I like it.
It smells of money.

1222
00:47:39,930 --> 00:47:41,932
It was a great idea, bringing
Dawn and Foster together.

1223
00:47:41,932 --> 00:47:43,934
I would have never thought of that.
I gotta admit,

1224
00:47:43,934 --> 00:47:46,937
you may not be a complete
idiot after all. Ha ha!

1225
00:47:46,937 --> 00:47:47,938
Your ideas here
aren't half bad,

1226
00:47:47,938 --> 00:47:48,939
but I hate the title,
I hate the ending.

1227
00:47:49,439 --> 00:47:51,441
It's too depressing.

1228
00:47:52,943 --> 00:47:55,479
You think we're gonna be ready
for Cyrus by next week?

1229
00:47:55,946 --> 00:47:59,032
Cyrus? Uh, well...

1230
00:47:59,032 --> 00:48:00,534
don't you think
we ought to wait

1231
00:48:00,534 --> 00:48:01,535
for Stella
to get back?

1232
00:48:01,535 --> 00:48:03,036
Stella? Fuck her!
Listen.

1233
00:48:03,537 --> 00:48:04,538
We take this to Stella,

1234
00:48:04,538 --> 00:48:06,540
she's just gonna take
credit for all your work,

1235
00:48:06,540 --> 00:48:08,542
for all of our work.
No. Fuck her.

1236
00:48:08,542 --> 00:48:11,545
It's kill or have your contract
terminated early. No, no.

1237
00:48:11,545 --> 00:48:13,046
We need to go
directly to the top.

1238
00:48:13,046 --> 00:48:15,549
We need to go to Cyrus.

1239
00:48:15,549 --> 00:48:17,551
But hold on a second.

1240
00:48:17,551 --> 00:48:20,053
Dawn's bringing
the project to Stella.

1241
00:48:20,053 --> 00:48:21,555
Remember, you passed.

1242
00:48:22,973 --> 00:48:24,891
You like Dawn,
don't you?

1243
00:48:25,425 --> 00:48:27,427
You consummate the relationship?

1244
00:48:27,427 --> 00:48:29,346
Dawn? Well...I mean,
Dawn and I--

1245
00:48:29,679 --> 00:48:31,765
I don't give a fuck.
Listen, I'm just sayin'--

1246
00:48:31,765 --> 00:48:33,683
Shut up and listen.

1247
00:48:33,683 --> 00:48:34,684
Women...

1248
00:48:35,018 --> 00:48:37,604
they respond to one thing
and one thing only:

1249
00:48:37,604 --> 00:48:40,106
Success. Now, this
isn't just me talking.

1250
00:48:40,607 --> 00:48:42,409
This is scien--
Sit down.

1251
00:48:42,609 --> 00:48:43,693
This is scientific fact.

1252
00:48:43,693 --> 00:48:45,028
It is primitive instinct

1253
00:48:45,245 --> 00:48:47,330
for a woman like Dawn
to choose a mate

1254
00:48:47,330 --> 00:48:48,782
who can best provide
for her needs,

1255
00:48:49,199 --> 00:48:52,752
for her wants. Now,
it's no offense to you,

1256
00:48:52,752 --> 00:48:57,257
but...you are
only an assistant.

1257
00:48:57,674 --> 00:48:59,543
Sure, I mean,
you're my assistant,

1258
00:48:59,793 --> 00:49:01,211
but, you know,
nonetheless...

1259
00:49:01,511 --> 00:49:02,879
an assistant.

1260
00:49:03,096 --> 00:49:05,465
Dawn, on the other hand,
is a...

1261
00:49:06,766 --> 00:49:07,717
is a producer.

1262
00:49:12,055 --> 00:49:14,357
Her car phone bills
are more than your rent.

1263
00:49:14,558 --> 00:49:17,561
So just how long do you think
you're going to last?

1264
00:49:17,861 --> 00:49:19,446
D-Dawn and I,
we--we--

1265
00:49:19,813 --> 00:49:21,898
All right,
I want to help out.

1266
00:49:21,898 --> 00:49:24,901
Because if you put
this project together,

1267
00:49:24,901 --> 00:49:27,904
you're not going to be just
the assistant any longer.

1268
00:49:30,407 --> 00:49:32,409
So...

1269
00:49:32,409 --> 00:49:37,214
I'm gonna give you
the chance...to play hero.

1270
00:49:37,214 --> 00:49:39,916
You...get to be

1271
00:49:39,916 --> 00:49:41,918
Dawn's white knight

1272
00:49:41,918 --> 00:49:44,721
in shining armor.

1273
00:49:47,007 --> 00:49:48,008
You.

1274
00:49:50,093 --> 00:49:52,178
You have to convince Dawn

1275
00:49:52,178 --> 00:49:56,182
to bring the project
back to me.

1276
00:49:56,182 --> 00:49:57,684
Not to Stella.

1277
00:49:58,184 --> 00:49:59,152
To me.

1278
00:49:59,152 --> 00:50:01,021
Now, I could do it,

1279
00:50:01,271 --> 00:50:03,773
but there'd be
no payoff for you.

1280
00:50:03,773 --> 00:50:05,191
I just don't know
how I would--

1281
00:50:09,079 --> 00:50:10,530
You do this thing...

1282
00:50:12,582 --> 00:50:15,085
you convince Dawn
to go this way...

1283
00:50:18,088 --> 00:50:19,756
and then you and I...

1284
00:50:22,759 --> 00:50:25,262
are going to run this place.

1285
00:50:27,380 --> 00:50:29,466
The both of us.

1286
00:50:32,435 --> 00:50:33,470
All right.

1287
00:50:35,889 --> 00:50:36,973
I--I'll do it.

1288
00:50:38,308 --> 00:50:40,694
He said
I was indispensable.

1289
00:50:40,694 --> 00:50:42,195
Look.

1290
00:50:42,195 --> 00:50:43,697
He gave me a beeper.

1291
00:50:43,697 --> 00:50:45,699
I think he--he's
beginning to respect me.

1292
00:50:45,699 --> 00:50:47,701
I think he's really
beginning to respect me.

1293
00:50:48,201 --> 00:50:49,202
Oh, God.
Please wake up.

1294
00:50:49,202 --> 00:50:50,704
He's just got you
on a shorter leash,

1295
00:50:50,704 --> 00:50:52,205
that's all.

1296
00:50:52,205 --> 00:50:54,207
Oh, you're doing it all wrong.
Move.

1298
00:50:56,910 --> 00:50:58,495
So...

1299
00:50:58,995 --> 00:51:00,497
Let me guess.

1300
00:51:00,497 --> 00:51:03,500
He gave you
that team horseshit, right?

1301
00:51:03,500 --> 00:51:06,503
"Win one for us,
you and me."

1302
00:51:06,503 --> 00:51:09,472
Exactly what is it
that we are supposed to do?

1303
00:51:09,806 --> 00:51:11,891
Not much.

1304
00:51:11,891 --> 00:51:13,893
To find a new title,
new ending...

1305
00:51:14,394 --> 00:51:16,396
you have to cancel your
meeting with Stella.

1306
00:51:16,396 --> 00:51:19,399
Unbelievable.
Un-fucking-believable.

1307
00:51:19,399 --> 00:51:20,350
Listen, all
Stella wants to do

1308
00:51:20,734 --> 00:51:23,320
is take credit
for your work.

1309
00:51:23,320 --> 00:51:24,321
Now, I already
convinced Buddy

1310
00:51:24,321 --> 00:51:25,322
to go directly
to Cyrus.

1311
00:51:25,322 --> 00:51:26,323
Now, he can't do that

1312
00:51:26,323 --> 00:51:28,325
if you pitch it
to Stella.

1313
00:51:28,325 --> 00:51:29,326
I don't want to jeopardize

1314
00:51:29,326 --> 00:51:30,827
your relationship with Stella.

1315
00:51:30,827 --> 00:51:32,329
I'm sorry, but this is
the only way--

1316
00:51:32,829 --> 00:51:34,497
Stop.
Do not apologize.

1317
00:51:34,497 --> 00:51:35,999
It's a sign of weakness.

1318
00:51:37,867 --> 00:51:38,952
Move.

1319
00:51:41,454 --> 00:51:43,873
Don't tell me what
needs to be done, Guy.

1320
00:51:44,207 --> 00:51:46,793
I know the drill...

1321
00:51:46,793 --> 00:51:50,296
the politicking,
the compromises...

1322
00:51:50,296 --> 00:51:52,799
the spilling of coffee
on ourselves

1323
00:51:52,799 --> 00:51:54,184
in the race to kiss ass.

1324
00:51:54,467 --> 00:51:57,554
Oh. Actually,
Buddy did that.

1325
00:51:57,554 --> 00:52:01,057
I let--I let his coffee get cold,
and he threw it at me.

1326
00:52:01,057 --> 00:52:02,559
But I learned
a valuable lesson--

1327
00:52:02,559 --> 00:52:04,944
Never let Buddy's coffee
get cold.

1328
00:52:05,278 --> 00:52:08,365
And...this?

1329
00:52:08,365 --> 00:52:09,866
It's a bagel stain.

1330
00:52:09,866 --> 00:52:10,867
Bagel stain?

1331
00:52:10,867 --> 00:52:13,870
Yeah. Well, I put too much
cream cheese on his bagel,

1332
00:52:13,870 --> 00:52:15,622
so he threw it at me.

1333
00:52:15,822 --> 00:52:18,408
But, again, I learned
a very valuable lesson--

1334
00:52:18,408 --> 00:52:20,910
Never put too much
cream cheese on Buddy's bagels.

1335
00:52:21,327 --> 00:52:23,296
Yeah. He really
respects you.

1336
00:52:24,664 --> 00:52:26,132
I think
we should wait.

1337
00:52:26,132 --> 00:52:27,133
I will wait,

1338
00:52:27,133 --> 00:52:28,501
and I want
to go to Stella.

1339
00:52:28,802 --> 00:52:31,171
No. Bu--Buddy wants
to do this now.

1340
00:52:31,388 --> 00:52:32,972
Look, if this picture
is big,

1341
00:52:34,474 --> 00:52:36,309
we'll--we'll go make
our own movies. We'll--

1342
00:52:36,593 --> 00:52:39,095
we just have to deal
with Buddy on this one.

1343
00:52:41,014 --> 00:52:42,432
Do you hate me?

1344
00:52:42,766 --> 00:52:44,350
Is that it?
I mean...

1345
00:52:44,350 --> 00:52:46,820
You do. You do.
You hate me.

1346
00:52:47,237 --> 00:52:49,322
Oh, God.
I don't hate you.

1347
00:52:53,326 --> 00:52:54,828
I just...

1348
00:52:54,828 --> 00:52:57,664
want you to make
the right choice.

1349
00:52:59,999 --> 00:53:01,000
I say we go
with Buddy.

1351
00:53:05,755 --> 00:53:07,340
Ok...

1352
00:53:07,340 --> 00:53:09,342
but know this...

1353
00:53:09,843 --> 00:53:11,845
I have seen
what he can do.

1354
00:53:11,845 --> 00:53:13,296
You cannot get into bed with him

1355
00:53:13,296 --> 00:53:14,347
without getting fucked.

1356
00:53:14,347 --> 00:53:15,849
He plays
a zero-sum game.

1357
00:53:15,849 --> 00:53:17,350
That's his drill.

1358
00:53:17,851 --> 00:53:20,854
Nobody wins unless
somebody loses.

1359
00:53:21,354 --> 00:53:22,722
Yeah, well...

1360
00:53:23,056 --> 00:53:25,141
As long as
I don't lose you.

1362
00:53:31,448 --> 00:53:32,315
Loss.

1363
00:53:33,817 --> 00:53:36,319
They say that
real pain...

1364
00:53:36,319 --> 00:53:38,822
real suffering...

1365
00:53:38,822 --> 00:53:40,323
is caused from loss.

1366
00:53:41,825 --> 00:53:43,543
Loss of family...

1367
00:53:45,044 --> 00:53:46,546
and loss of love.

1368
00:53:48,548 --> 00:53:50,967
Loss of the things
that matter most.

1369
00:53:56,723 --> 00:53:57,724
I like it.

1370
00:53:59,225 --> 00:54:01,227
It's a little different
look for you, but I like.

1371
00:54:02,729 --> 00:54:04,230
Ok.

1372
00:54:04,731 --> 00:54:06,232
Now...

1373
00:54:06,232 --> 00:54:07,734
let's forget
all the other shit

1374
00:54:07,734 --> 00:54:09,235
we've been doing here
tonight, ok?

1375
00:54:09,235 --> 00:54:11,738
Let's--let's
start thinking big...

1376
00:54:11,738 --> 00:54:13,740
uh, grand...

1377
00:54:13,740 --> 00:54:15,241
abbondante, if you will.

1378
00:54:17,744 --> 00:54:19,696
I'll be right back.

1379
00:54:19,696 --> 00:54:20,747
Don't go anywhere.

1380
00:54:35,628 --> 00:54:37,130
?? Ta-da ??

1381
00:54:40,633 --> 00:54:42,602
So?

1382
00:54:42,602 --> 00:54:43,603
What do you think?

1383
00:54:47,140 --> 00:54:48,107
That's it?

1384
00:54:49,642 --> 00:54:51,060
That's all?
Come on!

1385
00:54:52,645 --> 00:54:55,648
Look at yourself.

1386
00:54:55,648 --> 00:54:57,150
Look at your face.

1387
00:54:57,150 --> 00:54:58,618
Look at your
precious hair.

1388
00:54:59,618 --> 00:55:01,037
I mean...

1389
00:55:01,371 --> 00:55:02,455
There's no way
that Rogaine's

1390
00:55:02,455 --> 00:55:03,957
gonna help you
out of this one, my friend,

1391
00:55:03,957 --> 00:55:05,909
I'm tellin' you.

1392
00:55:05,909 --> 00:55:07,460
You are fucked up.

1393
00:55:14,968 --> 00:55:15,969
Fine.

1394
00:55:15,969 --> 00:55:17,470
You want to go back
to the hot sauce,

1395
00:55:17,470 --> 00:55:18,471
that's fine by me.

1397
00:55:23,927 --> 00:55:25,979
7 years.

1398
00:55:27,981 --> 00:55:28,765
What?

1400
00:55:31,568 --> 00:55:33,570
The mirror.

1401
00:55:34,070 --> 00:55:36,072
7 years of bad luck.

1402
00:55:36,072 --> 00:55:38,858
Ha ha ha ha ha!

1404
00:55:41,611 --> 00:55:42,579
Shut up.

1405
00:55:45,498 --> 00:55:46,499
Shut up!

1407
00:55:51,254 --> 00:55:52,255
I said, shut up!

1408
00:55:56,426 --> 00:55:59,429
Oh...that's brilliant.

1409
00:55:59,429 --> 00:56:01,431
That's fuckin' brilliant.

1410
00:56:01,431 --> 00:56:02,799
Ha ha ha!

1411
00:56:03,099 --> 00:56:05,685
This is genius,
sheer fucking genius.

1412
00:56:05,685 --> 00:56:07,687
This is great work, Guy.

1413
00:56:07,687 --> 00:56:09,689
Thanks. Well, you said
you needed an ending.

1414
00:56:09,689 --> 00:56:11,190
And to set it
in a laundromat.

1415
00:56:11,190 --> 00:56:13,476
It's perfect. It's real.
It's believable.

1416
00:56:13,693 --> 00:56:16,279
Right, right, right. And--
and what's more romantic

1417
00:56:16,279 --> 00:56:18,031
than a woman scrubbing
your shorts, right?

1419
00:56:19,866 --> 00:56:20,867
Oh, that's great.

1420
00:56:21,367 --> 00:56:22,735
Oh, really, good work.

1421
00:56:23,069 --> 00:56:25,154
Really? Well--no,
thank you very much.

1422
00:56:25,154 --> 00:56:26,372
We have a go movie.

1423
00:56:26,372 --> 00:56:28,408
Cyrus is gonna
green-light this right away.

1424
00:56:28,408 --> 00:56:29,909
I'm gonna show him
these notes.

1425
00:56:29,909 --> 00:56:30,910
He is gonna love it.

1426
00:56:30,910 --> 00:56:32,378
It's "Say good-bye, Stella"

1427
00:56:32,378 --> 00:56:34,247
and "hello, Buddy and Guy."

1428
00:56:36,549 --> 00:56:37,333
To hell with that.
Don't worry about that.

1429
00:56:37,634 --> 00:56:38,718
It's minor details.

1430
00:56:38,718 --> 00:56:40,219
He's gonna be too excited
about content

1431
00:56:40,219 --> 00:56:42,221
to worry about spelling.
Congratulations.

1432
00:56:42,722 --> 00:56:44,223
You did it.

1433
00:56:44,223 --> 00:56:45,725
I am not gonna forget this.

1434
00:56:45,725 --> 00:56:47,727
Get ready to meet
the chairman of the board.

1435
00:56:47,727 --> 00:56:49,729
I'm gonna tell Cyrus
about you.

1436
00:56:49,729 --> 00:56:52,732
You earned it.
You deserve it.

1437
00:56:52,732 --> 00:56:54,734
Oh, shit.

1438
00:56:54,734 --> 00:56:56,185
I left my belt
at Marnie's last night.

1439
00:56:56,736 --> 00:56:58,237
I can't see Cyrus
like this.

1440
00:57:02,241 --> 00:57:03,242
Oh.

1442
00:57:14,754 --> 00:57:16,255
Buddy Ackerman's office.

1443
00:57:16,255 --> 00:57:17,757
Dawn.

1444
00:57:17,757 --> 00:57:20,259
Buddy loved the notes.

1445
00:57:20,259 --> 00:57:22,762
Yeah. He's in a meeting
with Cyrus right now.

1446
00:57:22,762 --> 00:57:24,180
Yeah, Cyrus.

1447
00:57:24,464 --> 00:57:26,015
Cyrus.

1448
00:57:26,015 --> 00:57:27,550
They're coming
down the hall right now.

1449
00:57:27,550 --> 00:57:28,468
Let me call you back.

1450
00:57:28,801 --> 00:57:30,386
I'll call you back.

1451
00:57:30,386 --> 00:57:31,354
Let's face it, guys.

1452
00:57:32,388 --> 00:57:34,774
than a girl scrubbing
a guy's underwear.

1453
00:57:34,774 --> 00:57:36,275
You know what I mean?

1454
00:57:36,275 --> 00:57:38,277
You think the kids
are gonna respond to this?

1455
00:57:38,778 --> 00:57:39,779
Oh, absolutely.

1456
00:57:39,779 --> 00:57:41,781
Cyrus, it speaks
to their generation,

1457
00:57:41,781 --> 00:57:43,733
a generation
that's been dissed,

1458
00:57:43,733 --> 00:57:46,119
disillusioned,
disappointed, dismayed.

1459
00:57:46,402 --> 00:57:47,487
Right, Foster?

1460
00:57:47,487 --> 00:57:48,454
That sums it up
perfectly.

1461
00:57:48,905 --> 00:57:49,989
Well, good.

1462
00:57:49,989 --> 00:57:52,325
You can never tell
with you kids these days.

1463
00:57:52,625 --> 00:57:54,127
Let me just grab this,
and then we'll go eat.

1464
00:57:54,711 --> 00:57:56,212
Uh-huh.

1465
00:57:56,713 --> 00:57:59,799
Now, look, you just gotta
fix these spelling errors.

1466
00:58:00,800 --> 00:58:02,802
Oh, I'm sorry. I should have
checked it first.

1467
00:58:02,802 --> 00:58:04,337
I just had Guy
type it up for me.

1468
00:58:04,337 --> 00:58:05,805
But you know what? I was
just too damn excited.

1469
00:58:05,805 --> 00:58:07,306
Can you blame me?

1470
00:58:07,640 --> 00:58:09,225
Oh, no. I admire
that kind of enthusiasm.

1471
00:58:09,726 --> 00:58:11,010
This is a great project.

1472
00:58:11,260 --> 00:58:13,813
Buddy, I'm not gonna forget
who brought it to me.

1473
00:58:13,813 --> 00:58:15,264
You keep this up...

1474
00:58:15,264 --> 00:58:17,600
I'm gonna have to make you
president of production.

1475
00:58:17,600 --> 00:58:20,153
Me? Naw, I just want to
hit a home run for the team.

1476
00:58:20,653 --> 00:58:22,438
You all right, man.
Let's get somethin' to eat.

1477
00:58:22,688 --> 00:58:23,740
Yeah. I'm hungry.

1478
00:58:24,240 --> 00:58:25,241
Oh, yeah.

1479
00:58:44,794 --> 00:58:46,295
Buddy Ackerman's
office calling...

1480
00:58:46,295 --> 00:58:47,296
No, man, listen to me.

1481
00:58:47,797 --> 00:58:49,799
I'm tellin' you, I'm not
gonna let that one issue

1482
00:58:49,799 --> 00:58:51,350
be a fuckin' deal-breaker
on this.

1483
00:58:51,350 --> 00:58:53,853
It's im--
it's impossible, since--

1484
00:58:53,853 --> 00:58:55,855
No way.

1485
00:58:55,855 --> 00:58:57,974
Well, you go back, and
you make a counteroffer--

1486
00:59:00,643 --> 00:59:02,111
Where the fuck
are you goin'?

1487
00:59:02,445 --> 00:59:04,947
I was goin'
to the bathroom.

1488
00:59:04,947 --> 00:59:06,032
I--I need to go.

1489
00:59:06,032 --> 00:59:07,233
Well, forget
about what you need

1490
00:59:07,233 --> 00:59:08,234
and concentrate
on what I need.

1491
00:59:08,234 --> 00:59:09,202
I need you here.

1492
00:59:09,202 --> 00:59:11,037
Get me
on another fuckin' call.

1493
00:59:11,237 --> 00:59:12,822
Shut up for a second.
Listen to me, all right?

1494
00:59:12,822 --> 00:59:14,791
I'm tellin' you, I don't care
what Stella said.

1495
00:59:15,158 --> 00:59:17,493
You...close the deal.

1496
00:59:17,710 --> 00:59:20,213
We're gonna lose the kid.
All right? Get back to me.

1497
00:59:22,165 --> 00:59:24,917
This is Buddy Ackerman's
office calling.

1498
00:59:25,301 --> 00:59:27,386
Fine. I'll have him
get back to you.

1499
00:59:34,477 --> 00:59:36,479
Buddy Ackerman's office
calling.

1500
00:59:39,482 --> 00:59:41,017
Uh, fine. Yes.
We'll hold.

1501
00:59:41,017 --> 00:59:42,351
But please get him.

1502
00:59:45,404 --> 00:59:46,189
Water?

1503
00:59:52,111 --> 00:59:53,696
Uh, this is Buddy Ackerman's
office calling.

1504
00:59:54,197 --> 00:59:55,531
I don't want any water.

1505
00:59:58,251 --> 01:00:00,670
Buddy Ackerman's office
calling.

1506
01:00:02,505 --> 01:00:03,456
Thank you.

1508
01:00:04,957 --> 01:00:05,925
Leave word.

1510
01:00:10,379 --> 01:00:11,848
Buddy Ackerman's office
calling.

1511
01:00:13,683 --> 01:00:15,635
Fine. Please.
Well, leave word.

1512
01:00:16,052 --> 01:00:17,637
Yes. We'll call back.

1513
01:00:19,138 --> 01:00:20,723
Arrrghh.

1515
01:00:28,698 --> 01:00:29,699
Wyoming.

1516
01:00:31,200 --> 01:00:34,237
What? Oh, you
goin' western now?

1517
01:00:34,237 --> 01:00:35,488
Forget about Montana.

1518
01:00:36,789 --> 01:00:38,741
Wyoming is--is...

1519
01:00:38,741 --> 01:00:42,295
it's clean.
It's--it's pure.

1520
01:00:42,295 --> 01:00:44,247
We'll--we'll never leave
except if you need something.

1521
01:00:44,247 --> 01:00:46,299
We'll only go into town
if we need something.

1522
01:00:46,299 --> 01:00:48,301
We? Aw.

1523
01:00:48,301 --> 01:00:50,803
Yeah. You're gonna
want to come, aren't you?

1524
01:00:50,803 --> 01:00:52,305
Mm-hmm.

1525
01:00:52,305 --> 01:00:53,806
I could write.

1526
01:00:55,808 --> 01:00:58,227
No more sucking up
to these...

1527
01:00:58,227 --> 01:00:59,812
egotistical idiots.

1528
01:01:01,814 --> 01:01:03,316
No more politicking.

1529
01:01:04,317 --> 01:01:05,818
No more bad scripts.

1530
01:01:09,322 --> 01:01:11,324
Most of all...

1531
01:01:11,324 --> 01:01:13,326
no more Buddy Ackerman.

1535
01:01:20,950 --> 01:01:24,453
Hi. This is Guy.
Leave me a message.

1537
01:01:25,955 --> 01:01:28,424
Guy, pick up the phone.

1538
01:01:28,424 --> 01:01:30,960
I know you're there.
Come on.

1539
01:01:30,960 --> 01:01:32,461
Pick up. Pick up.
Pick up. Pick up.

1540
01:01:32,461 --> 01:01:33,296
Hello.

1541
01:01:33,596 --> 01:01:35,047
Hey. How ya doin'?

1542
01:01:35,464 --> 01:01:37,049
Uh, I'm fine.
I'm here with--

1543
01:01:37,049 --> 01:01:37,883
Great. That's great.

1544
01:01:38,184 --> 01:01:39,268
All right,
let's do it.

1545
01:01:39,268 --> 01:01:40,136
Script status.

1546
01:01:40,603 --> 01:01:41,604
The new draft's in.
Notes by Monday.

1547
01:01:41,971 --> 01:01:44,440
That's great.
And the deal?

1548
01:01:44,690 --> 01:01:46,225
Signed and delivered
Friday night.

1549
01:01:46,609 --> 01:01:48,694
Ha ha!

1550
01:01:48,694 --> 01:01:49,695
Any new, uh--

1551
01:01:49,695 --> 01:01:51,697
No. No new hair products
this week.

1552
01:01:51,697 --> 01:01:53,199
All right. Ok.

1553
01:01:53,199 --> 01:01:55,201
No, that's great.
No, no. Great.

1554
01:01:55,201 --> 01:01:56,202
Um...

1555
01:01:56,702 --> 01:01:58,204
?? give me Mindy's number ??

1556
01:01:58,704 --> 01:02:00,072
Weekend's almost over, everyone,

1557
01:02:00,072 --> 01:02:01,574
so enjoy it while you can.

1558
01:02:03,075 --> 01:02:05,578
We're gonna continue on
with the Sunday Marathon,

1559
01:02:05,578 --> 01:02:07,580
nonstop, commercial-free...

1560
01:02:11,584 --> 01:02:13,419
I don't have it with me.
It's at the office.

1561
01:02:13,669 --> 01:02:16,255
Jesus Christ.
You can't do anything right.

1562
01:02:16,255 --> 01:02:18,758
You know I was
seeing her tonight.

1563
01:02:18,758 --> 01:02:19,759
How many times
have I told you,

1564
01:02:19,759 --> 01:02:20,760
"Your head has
gotta be a rolodex,

1565
01:02:20,760 --> 01:02:22,511
or your ass is gonna
be on the line"?

1566
01:02:22,728 --> 01:02:24,313
I know, I know,
I know. You're right.

1567
01:02:24,814 --> 01:02:26,182
Now, get down to the office
and get me her number.

1568
01:02:26,515 --> 01:02:27,600
Sss...

1570
01:02:31,404 --> 01:02:32,405
Come on.

1571
01:02:32,405 --> 01:02:33,906
I have to go to the office.

1572
01:02:33,906 --> 01:02:35,191
You were just there.

1573
01:02:35,491 --> 01:02:36,575
I know. It'll just
take me a minute.

1574
01:02:36,575 --> 01:02:37,360
I gotta get
a phone number.

1575
01:02:37,576 --> 01:02:39,078
For what?
One of Buddy's bimbs?

1576
01:02:39,445 --> 01:02:40,529
Just try
to understand, ok?

1577
01:02:41,030 --> 01:02:42,031
I--I have to do this.

1578
01:02:42,415 --> 01:02:43,499
No, you don't!

1579
01:02:43,499 --> 01:02:45,868
You have played the doddering
houseboy long enough.

1580
01:02:46,118 --> 01:02:47,670
I know, I know,
but I made a commitment.

1581
01:02:48,037 --> 01:02:50,539
Oh, and you think that
means something to him?

1582
01:02:50,840 --> 01:02:52,925
You don't have to leave.
I'm coming right back.

1583
01:02:52,925 --> 01:02:54,210
Look, do me a favor.

1584
01:02:54,427 --> 01:02:55,511
The next time Buddy calls,

1585
01:02:55,511 --> 01:02:56,762
just say to him,
"I don't care."

1586
01:02:56,962 --> 01:02:58,547
No, really. Try it.
Say it with me.

1587
01:02:58,547 --> 01:03:00,516
"I don't care, Buddy."

1588
01:03:00,516 --> 01:03:01,550
Come on.

1589
01:03:04,387 --> 01:03:06,889
You really can't do it,
can you?

1590
01:03:08,391 --> 01:03:09,975
Wyoming, my ass.

1591
01:03:11,811 --> 01:03:13,896
You know, when you figure out
what it is you really want,

1592
01:03:13,896 --> 01:03:15,398
why don't you
give me a call?

1593
01:03:15,398 --> 01:03:16,399
You.

1594
01:03:16,899 --> 01:03:17,700
What?

1595
01:03:17,867 --> 01:03:19,952
You are
the only thing...

1596
01:03:19,952 --> 01:03:22,455
in my miserable,
shitty, little existence

1597
01:03:22,455 --> 01:03:23,906
that I have
to look forward to.

1598
01:03:23,906 --> 01:03:25,825
You're the only real thing
that I have left.

1599
01:03:26,375 --> 01:03:27,376
Then say it.

1600
01:03:28,878 --> 01:03:31,497
Say you don't care.
Come on, say it.

1601
01:03:40,222 --> 01:03:41,674
Fine. Leave.
Your project's set up.

1602
01:03:42,174 --> 01:03:42,842
You don't need me
anymore.

1603
01:03:43,426 --> 01:03:45,344
You got what you wanted,
and I got laid.

1604
01:03:47,179 --> 01:03:49,231
"Gotta give action
to get action."

1605
01:03:53,736 --> 01:03:54,653
Yeah, that's it.

1606
01:03:56,105 --> 01:03:57,606
That's it exactly.

1607
01:03:58,607 --> 01:04:00,910
Congratulations, Guy.
You just graduated.

1608
01:04:02,828 --> 01:04:04,413
You're gonna make a killing
in this business.

1610
01:04:13,339 --> 01:04:15,674
Protect my interests,

1611
01:04:15,674 --> 01:04:17,176
serve my needs.

1612
01:04:17,176 --> 01:04:18,627
Christ, you're dense.

1613
01:04:18,627 --> 01:04:19,462
No wonder
your wife left you.

1614
01:04:19,678 --> 01:04:21,764
That's another thing.

1615
01:04:22,264 --> 01:04:23,682
All--all this time
that I've worked for you,

1616
01:04:23,682 --> 01:04:26,268
I still don't know a thing
about your ex-wife.

1617
01:04:26,685 --> 01:04:27,603
Jesus, not a trace.

1618
01:04:27,887 --> 01:04:29,472
Not even a picture
in the whole house of her.

1619
01:04:29,472 --> 01:04:31,974
What...
was she beautiful?

1620
01:04:32,942 --> 01:04:33,893
Yes.

1621
01:04:34,226 --> 01:04:35,311
Did you love her?

1622
01:04:36,779 --> 01:04:37,813
Yes.

1623
01:04:37,813 --> 01:04:39,315
Oh.

1624
01:04:39,815 --> 01:04:40,816
Well, how nice.

1625
01:04:44,820 --> 01:04:46,655
When's she comin' home?

1626
01:04:46,956 --> 01:04:49,041
Mmm. I forgot.

1628
01:04:50,543 --> 01:04:51,994
She left ya.
Ha ha ha ha.

1630
01:04:55,047 --> 01:04:56,999
What do you want?

1631
01:04:57,416 --> 01:04:58,501
What do I want?
What do I want?

1632
01:04:58,501 --> 01:05:00,002
What do I want?
Well...

1633
01:05:01,504 --> 01:05:03,506
Tell me a story.

1634
01:05:03,506 --> 01:05:05,307
Tell me about
a young Buddy in love

1635
01:05:05,307 --> 01:05:06,809
with a woman who
just didn't want him.

1637
01:05:09,812 --> 01:05:12,181
Was it a painful separation?

1638
01:05:14,099 --> 01:05:15,601
Did you--
did you find her

1639
01:05:15,601 --> 01:05:19,104
in the passionate throes
of a secret lover, hmm?

1640
01:05:20,105 --> 01:05:21,524
Did she take you
for everything you had,

1641
01:05:21,857 --> 01:05:22,942
or did the lousy bitch
only get half?

1642
01:05:22,942 --> 01:05:23,909
She died.

1643
01:05:26,445 --> 01:05:29,448
Oh. Is that all?
Ha ha.

1644
01:05:29,448 --> 01:05:31,951
Well, boo hoo.

1645
01:05:31,951 --> 01:05:34,453
What a line.

1646
01:05:34,453 --> 01:05:35,955
"My wife died.

1647
01:05:36,455 --> 01:05:38,457
"Can you come home with me?

1648
01:05:38,457 --> 01:05:41,343
Hold me. Love me.
Fuck me." Christ.

1649
01:05:42,627 --> 01:05:44,713
God. You are such an asshole.

1650
01:05:45,214 --> 01:05:46,682
Christmas Eve,
12 years ago.

1651
01:05:48,217 --> 01:05:50,719
She was on her way
to the mall.

1652
01:05:50,719 --> 01:05:52,721
I was supposed to
have gone with her.

1653
01:05:52,721 --> 01:05:54,690
We hadn't started our
christmas shopping yet.

1654
01:05:55,057 --> 01:05:57,142
But it was
gonna be simple.

1655
01:05:57,142 --> 01:05:59,111
Just some stuff
for our parents.

1656
01:05:59,111 --> 01:06:00,646
Money was tight,
and...

1657
01:06:00,646 --> 01:06:01,614
shopping was
a hassle anyway.

1658
01:06:02,147 --> 01:06:02,898
We even promised

1659
01:06:03,115 --> 01:06:05,701
not to give
each other gifts.

1660
01:06:05,701 --> 01:06:07,703
On the way,
there was a...

1661
01:06:07,703 --> 01:06:09,288
car that had
broken down,

1662
01:06:09,788 --> 01:06:12,291
so mallory
pulled over to help.

1663
01:06:12,291 --> 01:06:13,792
I always told her
she was such a busybody,

1664
01:06:14,210 --> 01:06:15,661
but she just called it
being nice.

1665
01:06:16,161 --> 01:06:17,746
She got out and...

1666
01:06:19,215 --> 01:06:20,749
asked if everything
was all right

1667
01:06:20,749 --> 01:06:22,167
or something stupid.

1668
01:06:22,551 --> 01:06:24,136
Anyway, it was a scam--

1669
01:06:24,637 --> 01:06:27,139
bunch of punk kids
stealing cars.

1670
01:06:27,139 --> 01:06:27,973
They shot her.

1671
01:06:29,892 --> 01:06:31,310
I was stuck
at the office

1672
01:06:31,310 --> 01:06:32,394
wrapping christmas gifts
for my boss.

1673
01:06:32,895 --> 01:06:34,396
Lot of gifts. We had
a good year that year.

1674
01:06:34,897 --> 01:06:36,398
I was there until 3 A.M.

1675
01:06:36,398 --> 01:06:38,317
And the whole time,
I'm thinking to myself,

1676
01:06:38,317 --> 01:06:39,852
"oh, boy...

1677
01:06:39,852 --> 01:06:41,820
"she is gonna be pissed.

1678
01:06:41,820 --> 01:06:44,356
When I get home,
I am a dead man."

1679
01:06:45,357 --> 01:06:47,243
Anyway, I got home,

1680
01:06:47,576 --> 01:06:48,661
got the message,

1681
01:06:48,661 --> 01:06:50,663
went down to the hospital
to identify her.

1682
01:06:52,665 --> 01:06:53,866
It was a whole week
into the new year

1683
01:06:53,866 --> 01:06:54,917
before I found them,

1684
01:06:54,917 --> 01:06:56,919
these stupid wind-up
toys and a note.

1685
01:06:58,420 --> 01:07:00,339
"In the constant
rat race of life,

1686
01:07:00,339 --> 01:07:03,926
don't ever forget
to unwind."

1687
01:07:03,926 --> 01:07:06,679
She was never really
any good at writing notes.

1688
01:07:06,962 --> 01:07:07,546
I didn't know.

1689
01:07:08,047 --> 01:07:09,548
Oh, "I didn't know."
Imagine that.

1690
01:07:10,049 --> 01:07:12,017
Boy genius here
didn't know something.

1691
01:07:12,017 --> 01:07:13,552
Hey, look...

1692
01:07:13,552 --> 01:07:16,055
that is no excuse
for your behavior.

1693
01:07:16,055 --> 01:07:17,056
You think you know
it all, don't you?

1694
01:07:17,556 --> 01:07:19,058
You're 25 years old.
You're a baby.

1695
01:07:19,058 --> 01:07:20,059
You don't know shit.

1696
01:07:20,059 --> 01:07:22,061
Look, I know what's fair, ok?

1697
01:07:22,061 --> 01:07:23,028
I know what's right.

1698
01:07:23,395 --> 01:07:24,947
Look, I can appreciate this.

1699
01:07:24,947 --> 01:07:26,982
I was young, too.
I felt just like you.

1700
01:07:26,982 --> 01:07:28,484
Hated authority,
hated all my bosses,

1701
01:07:28,984 --> 01:07:29,952
thought they
were full of shit.

1702
01:07:30,369 --> 01:07:31,453
Look,
it's like they say--

1703
01:07:31,453 --> 01:07:32,955
if you're not a rebel
by the age of 20,

1704
01:07:33,956 --> 01:07:35,708
but if you haven't
turned establishment by 30,

1705
01:07:35,708 --> 01:07:37,710
you got no brains...

1706
01:07:37,710 --> 01:07:39,828
because there are
no storybook romances,

1707
01:07:39,828 --> 01:07:42,748
no fairy tale endings.

1708
01:07:43,048 --> 01:07:45,134
So before you run out
and change the world,

1709
01:07:45,134 --> 01:07:46,502
ask yourself...

1710
01:07:47,803 --> 01:07:49,338
What do you really want?

1712
01:07:58,981 --> 01:08:02,234
?? When the plane lands ??

1713
01:08:04,520 --> 01:08:06,822
?? And the cracks ??

1714
01:08:06,822 --> 01:08:09,241
?? Give in the land ??

1715
01:08:09,575 --> 01:08:12,077
?? And the rocks turn ??

1716
01:08:12,077 --> 01:08:13,996
?? Into sand ??

1719
01:08:22,421 --> 01:08:24,006
Hank...

1720
01:08:24,006 --> 01:08:25,507
What happened to that delivery?

1721
01:08:27,009 --> 01:08:29,511
Uh-huh.

1722
01:08:29,511 --> 01:08:31,013
Uh-huh.

1723
01:08:32,514 --> 01:08:33,515
Ooh.

1724
01:08:35,517 --> 01:08:37,019
Stop it, Hank.

1725
01:08:37,019 --> 01:08:39,521
That's not what I asked for.

1726
01:08:39,521 --> 01:08:41,023
Mm-hmm.

1727
01:08:41,023 --> 01:08:43,025
Look, I don't care
if God himself

1728
01:08:43,025 --> 01:08:44,476
came down and destroyed
the messenger van.

1729
01:08:45,027 --> 01:08:46,478
What I care about is detail.

1730
01:08:46,478 --> 01:08:49,948
8:30 is not the same
as 8:00.

1731
01:08:49,948 --> 01:08:52,534
Hank, shut up,

1732
01:08:52,534 --> 01:08:55,537
listen, and learn.

1733
01:08:55,537 --> 01:08:59,041
When I ask for something
to be delivered at 8:00,

1734
01:08:59,041 --> 01:09:01,043
I expect it at 8:00.

1735
01:09:01,543 --> 01:09:03,545
I want it at 8:00,

1736
01:09:03,545 --> 01:09:05,464
not 8:30.

1737
01:09:05,464 --> 01:09:06,548
So the next time I ask

1738
01:09:06,548 --> 01:09:08,050
for something
to be delivered at 8:00,

1739
01:09:08,550 --> 01:09:09,551
get it there.

1741
01:09:12,054 --> 01:09:13,055
Good morning.

1742
01:09:13,055 --> 01:09:14,056
What's going on?

1743
01:09:14,556 --> 01:09:16,558
There was just a little
mix-up in the mail room.

1744
01:09:16,558 --> 01:09:19,561
Cyrus' birthday gift
is on its way.

1746
01:09:22,564 --> 01:09:23,515
The phone is ringing.

1748
01:09:25,067 --> 01:09:26,568
Buddy Ackerman's office.

1749
01:09:26,568 --> 01:09:27,569
Yes, Julie,
he's right here.

1750
01:09:27,569 --> 01:09:29,571
Hold on one moment,
please.

1751
01:09:29,571 --> 01:09:30,572
Cyrus.

1752
01:09:32,574 --> 01:09:34,576
Uh, uh, uh, uh.

1753
01:09:39,114 --> 01:09:40,699
Cyrus.

1754
01:09:41,200 --> 01:09:42,701
Hey.

1755
01:09:42,701 --> 01:09:45,287
?? Happy birthday to... ??

1756
01:09:47,289 --> 01:09:49,007
What, are you kidding?
How could I forget?

1757
01:09:50,676 --> 01:09:52,761
The project?

1758
01:09:52,761 --> 01:09:53,712
Looks great.

1759
01:09:54,096 --> 01:09:55,464
How great?

1760
01:09:55,681 --> 01:09:57,266
Like a hundred million
bucks great.

1761
01:09:57,266 --> 01:09:58,183
How's that sound?

1763
01:09:59,218 --> 01:10:01,386
Yeah? Ha ha.

1764
01:10:01,804 --> 01:10:02,688
Really.

1765
01:10:02,971 --> 01:10:05,023
Well, tell me about it.

1766
01:10:05,023 --> 01:10:07,059
Buddy Ackerman's office.

1767
01:10:07,559 --> 01:10:09,478
No, Foster.
He's out with Cyrus.

1768
01:10:09,862 --> 01:10:11,947
Well, you asked for it,
you got it.

1769
01:10:12,364 --> 01:10:13,949
I'll have him call you
right back, Foster.

1770
01:10:13,949 --> 01:10:17,453
As soon as he's off. Bye.

1771
01:10:17,453 --> 01:10:18,737
Aw, that's great.

1772
01:10:18,954 --> 01:10:20,489
Me? Oh, are you kidding?

1773
01:10:20,906 --> 01:10:22,791
I got no time.
I'm too busy workin' for you.

1774
01:10:22,991 --> 01:10:24,877
Yeah, well, ok.

1775
01:10:25,127 --> 01:10:26,161
All right.

1776
01:10:26,628 --> 01:10:28,080
Well, anything you say.

1777
01:10:28,380 --> 01:10:29,748
I'll take care of it.

1778
01:10:29,748 --> 01:10:30,999
Uh, foster--

1779
01:10:30,999 --> 01:10:33,585
The notes? Yeah, you'll
get them by 6:00 tonight.

1780
01:10:33,585 --> 01:10:34,920
Guy's working on 'em
right now.

1781
01:10:35,137 --> 01:10:39,758
Guy? Oh, he is
fan-fuckin'-tastic.

1782
01:10:39,758 --> 01:10:42,144
He's the best.
He's the best I've ever had.

1783
01:10:42,144 --> 01:10:44,096
I'm gonna have to start
lookin' after my back.

1784
01:10:44,513 --> 01:10:47,065
He's comin' up.
He's the one to watch. Yeah.

1785
01:10:47,432 --> 01:10:48,517
The one movin' up.

1786
01:10:49,518 --> 01:10:50,986
Uh-huh.

1787
01:10:50,986 --> 01:10:53,522
Ok. Yeah. Bye-bye.

1789
01:10:55,824 --> 01:10:57,860
You see?

1790
01:10:58,360 --> 01:10:59,361
I'm lookin' out for you.

1791
01:11:01,363 --> 01:11:05,868
Listen to me, nobody else,

1792
01:11:05,868 --> 01:11:07,870
because I have your
best interests at heart.

1793
01:11:11,256 --> 01:11:14,343
Do I look that... stupid?
Do I look that dumb?

1794
01:11:14,843 --> 01:11:17,429
Un-un-unbelievable!

1795
01:11:17,429 --> 01:11:18,847
Did you really think that
you could pull that on me?

1796
01:11:19,181 --> 01:11:20,716
Hey, I told Cyrus
about you!

1797
01:11:21,099 --> 01:11:22,050
Bullshit!

1798
01:11:22,384 --> 01:11:22,968
I never lied about that.

1799
01:11:24,469 --> 01:11:25,971
That's bullshit. I told him.
He knows who you are.

1800
01:11:26,355 --> 01:11:28,807
You lied!
You lied to me!

1801
01:11:29,107 --> 01:11:30,642
I told you what
you wanted to hear.

1802
01:11:30,642 --> 01:11:31,860
I told you what
you needed to hear.

1803
01:11:31,860 --> 01:11:32,895
Bullshit.

1804
01:11:33,278 --> 01:11:35,364
You were getting
complacent, ungrateful,

1805
01:11:35,364 --> 01:11:37,149
complete and total
job burnout,

1806
01:11:37,366 --> 01:11:39,451
and don't think
I didn't notice.

1807
01:11:39,451 --> 01:11:41,620
You just didn't
give a shit anymore,

1808
01:11:41,620 --> 01:11:43,121
draggin' your feet everywhere,

1809
01:11:43,488 --> 01:11:45,040
telling everybody
you were doing my job,

1810
01:11:45,374 --> 01:11:46,825
that you were
running the show,

1811
01:11:47,125 --> 01:11:49,044
that without you,
I was nothing.

1812
01:11:49,294 --> 01:11:50,379
Yeah.

1813
01:11:50,379 --> 01:11:52,247
People tell me things.

1814
01:11:52,548 --> 01:11:54,132
So don't come preaching to me

1815
01:11:54,633 --> 01:11:55,884
about your ideas
of what's fair.

1816
01:11:56,084 --> 01:11:58,170
You're no martyr here.
You're no hero.

1817
01:11:58,170 --> 01:11:59,638
You're just
a fuckin' hypocrite.

1818
01:12:00,055 --> 01:12:02,090
You're just like any
other punk kid out there

1819
01:12:02,090 --> 01:12:03,058
lookin' for a way in,

1820
01:12:03,342 --> 01:12:04,426
any way in,

1821
01:12:04,426 --> 01:12:05,761
and you need me!

1822
01:12:06,061 --> 01:12:09,231
Does that give you the right
to belittle people?

1823
01:12:09,731 --> 01:12:10,599
To abuse people?

1824
01:12:10,899 --> 01:12:12,434
What gives you the right

1825
01:12:12,434 --> 01:12:13,435
to treat people like--

1826
01:12:13,852 --> 01:12:14,937
Because I earned it!

1827
01:12:15,437 --> 01:12:17,940
What, you think someone
just handed me this job?

1828
01:12:17,940 --> 01:12:19,942
I've handled the phones,
I've juggled the bimbos,

1829
01:12:19,942 --> 01:12:21,243
I've--I've put up
with the tyrants,

1830
01:12:21,243 --> 01:12:22,277
the yellers, the screamers.

1831
01:12:22,277 --> 01:12:24,279
I've done more than
you can even imagine

1832
01:12:24,780 --> 01:12:26,698
in that small mind of yours.

1833
01:12:27,032 --> 01:12:29,451
I paid my dues.

1834
01:12:29,668 --> 01:12:32,120
I didn't spend one year--

1835
01:12:32,454 --> 01:12:34,039
And I spent 10!

1836
01:12:34,539 --> 01:12:36,375
Damn it, it's my turn
to be selfish!

1837
01:12:36,625 --> 01:12:37,709
It's my turn.

1838
01:12:38,176 --> 01:12:39,211
See, that's the trouble

1839
01:12:39,211 --> 01:12:42,714
with your fucking MTV
microwave-dinner generation.

1840
01:12:42,714 --> 01:12:44,716
You all want it now.

1841
01:12:45,133 --> 01:12:47,219
You think you deserve it
just because you want it?

1842
01:12:47,219 --> 01:12:49,187
It doesn't work like that.

1843
01:12:49,187 --> 01:12:50,222
You have to earn it.

1844
01:12:50,722 --> 01:12:51,607
You have to take it.

1845
01:12:51,890 --> 01:12:54,977
You have to make it yours.

1846
01:12:54,977 --> 01:12:56,478
But first, Guy,

1847
01:12:56,478 --> 01:12:58,480
you need to decide

1848
01:12:58,480 --> 01:13:00,816
what it is
you really want.

1849
01:13:07,155 --> 01:13:08,156
I want you...

1850
01:13:10,158 --> 01:13:14,663
to stop calling me
in the middle of the night.

1851
01:13:14,663 --> 01:13:18,166
I want you to stop sending me
to the fucking office

1852
01:13:18,166 --> 01:13:20,168
for your goddamned
phone numbers,

1853
01:13:20,168 --> 01:13:21,470
for your fucking sunglasses!

1854
01:13:21,670 --> 01:13:24,723
I want my life back!

1855
01:13:27,676 --> 01:13:29,177
What life?

1856
01:13:29,678 --> 01:13:30,679
What life?
I gave you life.

1857
01:13:30,679 --> 01:13:32,180
Before me,
you were nothing.

1858
01:13:32,180 --> 01:13:33,982
Before me,
you were an ink spot,

1859
01:13:34,149 --> 01:13:37,235
and now you're playing
in the majors.

1860
01:13:37,235 --> 01:13:39,237
I made you.

1861
01:13:39,237 --> 01:13:41,106
You will always be Guy

1862
01:13:41,106 --> 01:13:42,607
from Buddy Ackerman's office.

1863
01:13:42,607 --> 01:13:44,109
You want to go back to your
shitty little existence,

1864
01:13:44,609 --> 01:13:45,494
go ahead. Leave.
There's the door.

1865
01:13:46,862 --> 01:13:48,363
No one's stopping you.

1866
01:13:48,363 --> 01:13:52,284
You could have left any day,
but you stayed.

1867
01:13:52,701 --> 01:13:55,287
So let's forget the dudley
damn do-right crap,

1868
01:13:55,287 --> 01:13:57,789
because out here,
it's kill your parents,

1869
01:13:57,789 --> 01:14:00,292
fuck your friends,
and have a nice day!

1870
01:14:02,511 --> 01:14:04,513
And that makes it all right?

1871
01:14:04,513 --> 01:14:05,514
That's a load of shit.

1872
01:14:05,514 --> 01:14:07,516
I don't make the rules.
I play by them.

1873
01:14:08,016 --> 01:14:09,685
What, your job
is unfair to you?

1874
01:14:10,185 --> 01:14:12,471
Grow up. Way it goes.

1875
01:14:12,471 --> 01:14:14,473
People use you?
Life's unfair?

1876
01:14:14,473 --> 01:14:15,974
Grow up. Way it goes.

1877
01:14:16,391 --> 01:14:17,976
Your girlfriend
doesn't love you?

1878
01:14:17,976 --> 01:14:19,361
Tough shit. Way it goes.

1879
01:14:19,611 --> 01:14:21,697
Your wife gets raped and shot,

1880
01:14:21,697 --> 01:14:23,732
and they leave their
unfinished beers...

1881
01:14:36,745 --> 01:14:37,746
their...

1882
01:14:42,751 --> 01:14:44,753
their stinking longnecks...

1883
01:14:47,255 --> 01:14:49,257
just lying there
on the gr...

1884
01:14:58,266 --> 01:14:59,267
so be it.

1885
01:15:01,770 --> 01:15:03,238
Way it goes.

1886
01:15:10,445 --> 01:15:13,532
So, now you want to tell me
what you really want?

1887
01:15:16,868 --> 01:15:19,871
What this is really
all about...

1888
01:15:21,456 --> 01:15:23,458
What happened to you
this evening?

1893
01:15:46,148 --> 01:15:47,199
Hello?

1894
01:15:47,199 --> 01:15:49,067
Hi, Dawn.
It's, uh, Buddy. Hi.

1895
01:15:49,401 --> 01:15:50,952
I'm lookin' for Guy.
Have you seen him?

1896
01:15:50,952 --> 01:15:52,954
No. I haven't seen him
in a while, actually.

1897
01:15:52,954 --> 01:15:54,956
Aw, that's too bad.
Um, listen.

1898
01:15:54,956 --> 01:15:58,460
You want to come on over
and discuss the project?

1899
01:15:58,460 --> 01:16:01,463
You're not really
looking for Guy, are you?

1900
01:16:01,463 --> 01:16:03,965
Oops. You caught me.

1901
01:16:03,965 --> 01:16:05,967
So, what do you say?

1902
01:16:05,967 --> 01:16:08,970
I'd say I'm really busy. Sorry.

1903
01:16:08,970 --> 01:16:10,972
You forgetting what I taught you?
Never apologize.

1904
01:16:10,972 --> 01:16:15,477
It's a sign of weakness.
Never forgot it.

1905
01:16:15,977 --> 01:16:16,978
You know, I can
remember the days

1906
01:16:17,479 --> 01:16:17,979
when you would have
scurried over here

1907
01:16:18,480 --> 01:16:19,481
like an eager beaver.

1908
01:16:19,481 --> 01:16:22,484
Yeah, well, those days
are long gone.

1909
01:16:22,484 --> 01:16:25,487
That's why your career has
been on hold the past year.

1910
01:16:25,487 --> 01:16:26,988
Remember, you got to give
action to get action.

1911
01:16:26,988 --> 01:16:29,991
Never forgot that.
I gotta go, Buddy.

1912
01:16:29,991 --> 01:16:31,993
It's Guy, isn't it?
What's wrong? Can't see the boss

1913
01:16:31,993 --> 01:16:34,446
'cause you're
screwing the assistant?

1914
01:16:34,446 --> 01:16:36,498
Yeah, that's it.
That's it exactly.

1915
01:16:36,998 --> 01:16:38,416
Fine. He's no longer the assistant.

1916
01:16:38,750 --> 01:16:40,335
Excuse me?

1917
01:16:40,335 --> 01:16:42,337
You heard me.
He's history. He's gone.

1918
01:16:42,337 --> 01:16:44,840
There. Any problems
in coming over now?

1919
01:16:44,840 --> 01:16:47,209
I am warning you.
You leave Guy out of this.

1920
01:16:47,209 --> 01:16:49,211
He is not the problem, Buddy.

1921
01:16:49,211 --> 01:16:51,213
Well, maybe he is,
and maybe he isn't,

1922
01:16:51,213 --> 01:16:53,215
but there's really only
one way to find out--

1924
01:16:57,185 --> 01:16:58,687
Fuck.

1925
01:16:59,054 --> 01:17:02,140
Fuckin' men.
Fuckin' crazy.

1927
01:17:04,142 --> 01:17:05,143
What?!

1928
01:17:05,143 --> 01:17:08,146
Dawn? It's Guy.

1929
01:17:08,647 --> 01:17:09,531
Oh, h--hey.

1930
01:17:10,031 --> 01:17:14,569
Can I come over? I--
I think we need to talk.

1931
01:17:14,569 --> 01:17:17,122
Um...

1932
01:17:17,122 --> 01:17:18,623
Um, look, n-not--
not tonight, ok?

1933
01:17:18,623 --> 01:17:21,076
I--I've got, uh...

1934
01:17:21,076 --> 01:17:24,129
a lot of scripts to read
and stuff, so, uh...

1935
01:17:24,129 --> 01:17:25,630
Can we do this tomorrow?

1936
01:17:25,630 --> 01:17:28,633
Oh. uh...

1937
01:17:28,633 --> 01:17:31,136
Tomorrow.
Y-yeah. Ok.

1938
01:17:31,136 --> 01:17:32,637
Talk to me.
What is it?

1939
01:17:32,637 --> 01:17:35,640
Oh, nothing. I--I...

1940
01:17:35,640 --> 01:17:38,143
I just-- I...I wanted
to tell you something,

1941
01:17:38,143 --> 01:17:41,646
but I guess it can
wait till tomorrow.

1942
01:17:42,147 --> 01:17:43,648
Ok. Call--call me
in the morning, ok?

1943
01:17:43,648 --> 01:17:44,649
I will.

1944
01:17:46,651 --> 01:17:48,653
Dawn...

1945
01:17:51,156 --> 01:17:51,656
What?

1946
01:17:52,157 --> 01:17:53,658
I'm really...

1947
01:17:56,161 --> 01:17:59,164
I'm really sorry.

1948
01:17:59,614 --> 01:18:00,665
Ok.

1950
01:18:06,371 --> 01:18:08,840
I love you.

1951
01:18:08,840 --> 01:18:10,875
I love you.

1954
01:18:29,945 --> 01:18:33,231
No, wait a minute.
R-reconsider what, Buddy?

1955
01:18:33,231 --> 01:18:36,234
Uh...what are you gonna do?
You gonna fire me?

1956
01:18:36,234 --> 01:18:37,869
I have another call.
Hello? Hello?

1957
01:18:37,869 --> 01:18:38,870
It's still me. Listen.
We couldn't return

1958
01:18:39,287 --> 01:18:40,372
A lot of calls today
because you've been away.

1959
01:18:40,372 --> 01:18:42,374
Now, what do you mean,
"reconsider--"

1960
01:18:42,374 --> 01:18:44,743
Hold on! Fucking phones.
Call waiting.

1961
01:18:44,743 --> 01:18:46,244
Call conferencing.

1962
01:18:46,244 --> 01:18:48,246
Gotta be a rocket scientist
to make this thing work.

1963
01:18:48,246 --> 01:18:50,749
Hello? Hello?

1964
01:18:50,749 --> 01:18:52,634
Buddy.

1965
01:18:52,917 --> 01:18:54,002
Well, hi.

1966
01:18:54,502 --> 01:18:57,505
Dawn. You win.

1967
01:18:57,505 --> 01:18:58,506
Really?

1968
01:18:58,506 --> 01:19:00,008
Midnight, right?

1969
01:19:00,008 --> 01:19:01,509
Yeah. Just like old times.

1970
01:19:01,509 --> 01:19:04,646
Yeah, not even close.
Shall I bring anything?

1971
01:19:05,146 --> 01:19:05,647
No, not a thing.

1972
01:19:06,147 --> 01:19:07,649
Just get your cute
butt over here.

1973
01:19:07,649 --> 01:19:09,017
I'll leave the key out.

1974
01:19:19,911 --> 01:19:21,246
Buddy, Dawn.

1975
01:19:21,496 --> 01:19:22,580
Well, hi.

1976
01:19:22,580 --> 01:19:23,948
Shall I bring anything?

1977
01:19:24,249 --> 01:19:25,166
I'll leave the key out.

1978
01:19:25,583 --> 01:19:26,167
Midnight, right?

1979
01:19:26,668 --> 01:19:28,119
Yeah. Just like old times.

1980
01:19:28,119 --> 01:19:29,120
Midnight, right?

1981
01:19:29,120 --> 01:19:30,038
Just get your cute
butt over here.

1982
01:19:30,338 --> 01:19:31,873
I'll leave the key out.

1983
01:19:47,856 --> 01:19:49,641
So we're left
with just one thing...

1984
01:19:49,641 --> 01:19:51,643
the only thing I know

1985
01:19:51,643 --> 01:19:55,146
that drives men
to hurt, to want.

1986
01:19:55,146 --> 01:19:58,650
This is about a girl,
isn't it, Guy?

1987
01:19:59,150 --> 01:20:01,569
This is about Dawn.

1988
01:20:01,870 --> 01:20:03,455
All this over a chick?

1989
01:20:03,455 --> 01:20:04,956
You fool!

1990
01:20:04,956 --> 01:20:06,741
Please,
just shut up.

1991
01:20:07,125 --> 01:20:08,209
Aw, Guy,
you disappoint me.

1992
01:20:08,209 --> 01:20:09,711
You're gonna have
to start thinking

1993
01:20:09,711 --> 01:20:11,212
with your head
and not your hips.

1994
01:20:11,212 --> 01:20:13,214
I gave you everything.

1995
01:20:15,717 --> 01:20:17,218
But you weren't satisfied.

1996
01:20:18,720 --> 01:20:20,588
You had to have her, too.

1997
01:20:20,889 --> 01:20:22,974
Oh, some gift.
She's not what you think.

1998
01:20:22,974 --> 01:20:25,477
Come on, grow up!
You know as well as I do

1999
01:20:25,477 --> 01:20:26,478
that a bed
is the best friend

2000
01:20:26,478 --> 01:20:28,980
a girl like Dawn can have.
Be a man!

2001
01:20:28,980 --> 01:20:30,982
If you're gonna lose it
every time some bim

2002
01:20:30,982 --> 01:20:32,484
decides to climb
the social ladder,

2003
01:20:32,484 --> 01:20:33,985
you're never
gonna make it!

2004
01:20:34,569 --> 01:20:36,571
Isn't that right, Dawn?

2005
01:20:38,073 --> 01:20:41,076
Dawn, honey, so glad you
made it on time, darling,

2006
01:20:41,576 --> 01:20:44,996
"because you got
some 'splanin' to do!"

2007
01:20:45,363 --> 01:20:47,916
Buddy, what happened to you?

2008
01:20:47,916 --> 01:20:49,784
Guy, what are you
doing here?

2009
01:20:50,118 --> 01:20:51,202
Oh, don't you think
that's a question

2010
01:20:51,202 --> 01:20:52,704
that you should be answering?

2011
01:20:53,088 --> 01:20:55,173
What?

2012
01:20:55,673 --> 01:20:57,175
Oh, Christ.
No, Guy,

2013
01:20:57,175 --> 01:20:58,676
this is not
what you think.

2014
01:20:59,177 --> 01:20:59,677
Oh, really?
Well, tell us.

2015
01:21:00,178 --> 01:21:01,179
What are we supposed
to think? Huh?

2016
01:21:01,179 --> 01:21:02,680
A young, eager producer

2017
01:21:02,680 --> 01:21:04,349
comes up to the house
of a top executive

2018
01:21:04,349 --> 01:21:05,850
for a midnight rendezvous?

2019
01:21:05,850 --> 01:21:08,186
She's right, Guy.
It's not what you think.

2020
01:21:08,186 --> 01:21:10,688
She's definitely not
selling girl scout cookies.

2021
01:21:11,106 --> 01:21:12,190
What has happened here?

2022
01:21:12,690 --> 01:21:14,192
Oh, stop. Stop with the
fuckin' stupid questions!

2023
01:21:14,192 --> 01:21:15,860
What do you think
has happened?

2024
01:21:15,860 --> 01:21:16,861
He's taken me hostage!

2025
01:21:16,861 --> 01:21:18,363
He's beaten me,
he's tortured me,

2026
01:21:18,863 --> 01:21:20,148
and I think
you're next, dear.

2027
01:21:21,399 --> 01:21:23,952
Guy, this--this is
completely insane.

2028
01:21:23,952 --> 01:21:25,453
Just put the gun down,

2029
01:21:25,870 --> 01:21:28,790
and why don't we
talk about this?

2030
01:21:28,790 --> 01:21:30,291
What the fuck do you think
we've been doin' all night?!

2031
01:21:30,742 --> 01:21:31,292
Dear, I don't think

2032
01:21:31,793 --> 01:21:32,794
you fully appreciate
the situation.

2033
01:21:33,211 --> 01:21:35,213
After you get past the
"oops, he caught us" stage

2034
01:21:35,797 --> 01:21:37,749
and realize we are both
fucked, let me know, ok?

2035
01:21:37,749 --> 01:21:40,385
Shut up! I've got
nothing to do with you.

2036
01:21:40,385 --> 01:21:41,553
Aw, I'm hurt.

2037
01:21:41,553 --> 01:21:43,421
What happened to standing
by your man, Dawn?

2038
01:21:43,755 --> 01:21:44,839
n.
oh, that's right.
you don't stand by your me

2039
01:21:45,340 --> 01:21:46,808
you stand on them
as you climb up

2040
01:21:46,808 --> 01:21:48,176
to get to
the next one's bed.

2041
01:21:48,510 --> 01:21:50,061
yeah, let me tell you
somethin' about dawn here.

2042
01:21:50,595 --> 01:21:52,013
she used to be quite
the little fuck towel.

2043
01:21:52,397 --> 01:21:53,481
fresh film school grad

2044
01:21:53,982 --> 01:21:55,350
who fucked her way
to top assistant desk,

2045
01:21:55,650 --> 01:21:56,734
fucked her way
to junior executive,

2046
01:21:56,734 --> 01:21:58,853
and then fucked
her way to V.P.

2047
01:21:59,237 --> 01:22:00,321
It was quite a rise.

2048
01:22:00,321 --> 01:22:01,906
Of course,
she stopped all that

2049
01:22:01,906 --> 01:22:03,408
the day she got
her producer deal.

2050
01:22:03,408 --> 01:22:06,277
Been 3 years now. Trying
to make important films.

2051
01:22:06,277 --> 01:22:07,779
Redeeming films.

2052
01:22:08,112 --> 01:22:09,697
See, she started to
worry about words like

2053
01:22:09,697 --> 01:22:12,083
honor, dignity,
and respect,

2054
01:22:12,083 --> 01:22:13,952
words that a one-time
two-bit tramp

2055
01:22:13,952 --> 01:22:14,953
could never afford.

2056
01:22:15,336 --> 01:22:16,921
How dare you judge me?

2057
01:22:16,921 --> 01:22:18,289
Who the hell
do you think you are?

2058
01:22:18,590 --> 01:22:19,674
Ok, fine.
You tell him, then.

2059
01:22:20,091 --> 01:22:22,510
What are you doing here?
What are you doing here?

2060
01:22:23,094 --> 01:22:23,595
Why don't you tell him?!

2061
01:22:24,095 --> 01:22:25,096
No, I think it's better

2062
01:22:25,096 --> 01:22:25,930
he hears about
your past from you.

2064
01:22:27,765 --> 01:22:28,683
Shut up!

2065
01:22:34,055 --> 01:22:35,557
Both of you...

2066
01:22:35,557 --> 01:22:37,559
Shut up.

2067
01:22:37,559 --> 01:22:39,444
Guy, you are acting
like a child.

2068
01:22:39,444 --> 01:22:40,895
You are no better
than he is right now.

2069
01:22:41,312 --> 01:22:43,398
Me? What about you?

2070
01:22:43,815 --> 01:22:45,867
Tell me something.

2071
01:22:46,201 --> 01:22:48,703
H-h-how long have you
been fucking him?

2072
01:22:48,987 --> 01:22:49,571
A couple of years now, actually.

2073
01:22:50,038 --> 01:22:51,322
Good years, if you--
shut up!

2074
01:22:54,409 --> 01:22:56,961
Guy, I know what
this looks like.

2075
01:22:56,961 --> 01:22:59,964
It is not what you think.
I came here for you.

2076
01:23:00,465 --> 01:23:02,250
I came here for us.

2077
01:23:04,052 --> 01:23:06,838
You came here for us?

2078
01:23:09,140 --> 01:23:12,594
I told him to promote you.
The film was getting made.

2079
01:23:12,594 --> 01:23:15,063
It's everything you wanted,
everything you hoped for.

2080
01:23:16,981 --> 01:23:19,484
No.

2081
01:23:19,484 --> 01:23:20,902
No, it isn't.

2082
01:23:21,185 --> 01:23:22,770
It--it's not
what I wanted.

2083
01:23:22,770 --> 01:23:24,689
It's not the way
it was supposed to be.

2084
01:23:25,073 --> 01:23:30,612
I wanted this for us.
I--I wanted this for you.

2085
01:23:35,450 --> 01:23:37,001
Excuse me.
Wait a minute.

2086
01:23:37,001 --> 01:23:38,503
You two think
you love each other,

2087
01:23:39,003 --> 01:23:40,755
and that's the only reason
you put up with my shit?

2088
01:23:41,256 --> 01:23:43,091
Jesus, that's pathetic.
That's about

2089
01:23:43,091 --> 01:23:44,542
the most pathetic thing
I've ever heard.

2090
01:23:44,959 --> 01:23:47,011
I told you to shut up!

2091
01:23:47,011 --> 01:23:49,347
Guy, this is
what he wants.

2092
01:23:49,347 --> 01:23:52,216
Put the gun down.

2093
01:23:52,216 --> 01:23:53,685
He has got to pay.

2094
01:23:54,018 --> 01:23:55,103
He is not worth it!

2095
01:23:55,103 --> 01:23:55,937
Let him do it.
Come on, Guy.

2096
01:23:56,220 --> 01:23:57,722
You know what
you have to do.

2097
01:23:58,022 --> 01:23:58,940
Don't you dare give up
everything you've worked for.

2098
01:23:59,140 --> 01:23:59,974
Come on, boy.
Take it.

2099
01:24:00,191 --> 01:24:02,610
We can fix this now
if you put the gun down.

2100
01:24:02,894 --> 01:24:03,978
You know what
you have to do.

2101
01:24:04,362 --> 01:24:05,229
It's yours, and
you know you want it.

2102
01:24:05,647 --> 01:24:07,615
If you don't take it,
I got no sympathy.

2103
01:24:08,032 --> 01:24:08,900
Don't you dare
throw everything away.

2104
01:24:09,117 --> 01:24:10,485
You have to do it.
You want to do it.

2105
01:24:10,735 --> 01:24:11,653
Do it!
All for nothing?!

2106
01:24:11,903 --> 01:24:13,988
Will you stay
the fuck out of this?!

2107
01:24:14,372 --> 01:24:16,908
I--I am trying to save
your life here.

2108
01:24:17,241 --> 01:24:18,826
And I am trying
to give Guy his.

2109
01:24:19,294 --> 01:24:20,328
Listen, baby,
he can't fuck his way

2110
01:24:20,328 --> 01:24:21,329
through the ranks

2111
01:24:21,329 --> 01:24:22,664
nearly as well as you can.

2112
01:24:22,914 --> 01:24:25,500
He's gotta kick and fight
and scratch his way there.

2113
01:24:25,500 --> 01:24:26,834
He doesn't have a choice.

2114
01:24:27,135 --> 01:24:28,720
You have nothing
to contribute to this,

2115
01:24:28,720 --> 01:24:30,672
so stay the fuck out!

2117
01:24:38,763 --> 01:24:40,598
Go ahead. Shoot.

2118
01:24:40,898 --> 01:24:41,482
I don't care.

2119
01:24:41,983 --> 01:24:43,484
Yabba-dabba-doo.

2120
01:24:43,484 --> 01:24:45,486
All right, Guy. Come on.
Let's finish this.

2121
01:24:45,486 --> 01:24:47,905
Give it to me. Show me
what you're made of.

2122
01:24:47,905 --> 01:24:50,908
Show me what you've learned.
Don't let me down, son.

2123
01:24:50,908 --> 01:24:52,910
Everything I've taught you
comes down to this.

2124
01:24:52,910 --> 01:24:57,782
This is the only way that
you could hope to survive.

2125
01:24:58,249 --> 01:25:02,587
Because life...
is not a movie.

2126
01:25:04,372 --> 01:25:06,624
Everyone lies.

2127
01:25:06,874 --> 01:25:09,677
Good guys lose.

2128
01:25:09,927 --> 01:25:10,511
And love...

2129
01:25:14,465 --> 01:25:18,019
does not conquer all.

2130
01:25:18,019 --> 01:25:20,021
So let's do this thing.

2131
01:25:20,438 --> 01:25:22,023
Let's finish it.

2132
01:25:25,526 --> 01:25:27,028
I'm sorry.

2133
01:25:28,696 --> 01:25:31,449
Do it! Come on!
Do it now!

2136
01:25:45,413 --> 01:25:46,914
Currently 78 degrees
in Hollywood,

2137
01:25:46,914 --> 01:25:49,717
and it's beginning to look
a lot like Christmas.

2139
01:26:18,746 --> 01:26:21,115
Hey, hey. Look who's
the new big man on campus.

2140
01:26:21,365 --> 01:26:24,368
Come on in
and sit down, Jack.

2141
01:26:26,254 --> 01:26:28,756
What? This is unbelievable.

2142
01:26:28,756 --> 01:26:30,758
Unbelievable.
You have got to be

2143
01:26:30,758 --> 01:26:32,627
the youngest executive
they've ever had here.

2144
01:26:32,927 --> 01:26:34,796
Yeah, well...

2145
01:26:35,012 --> 01:26:36,097
"Well," nothin'.
You deserve it.

2146
01:26:36,597 --> 01:26:38,099
You deserve it.
After you saved Buddy

2147
01:26:38,099 --> 01:26:39,517
from that crazy chick?
Unbelievable.

2148
01:26:39,967 --> 01:26:42,553
That's not quite
how it happened, Jack.

2149
01:26:42,553 --> 01:26:44,555
That's not quite
the way it happened?

2150
01:26:44,555 --> 01:26:47,391
Shit! This jilted lover
holds Buddy hostage,

2151
01:26:47,391 --> 01:26:49,894
beats him, tortures him,

2152
01:26:49,894 --> 01:26:51,395
and you ride in
and save the day.

2153
01:26:51,395 --> 01:26:53,731
Oh, above and beyond
the call of duty, Guy.

2154
01:26:53,948 --> 01:26:55,032
I was delivering
some scripts,

2155
01:26:55,032 --> 01:26:55,950
and I happened
to be there.

2156
01:26:56,367 --> 01:26:58,953
You pulled the trigger
on her, man!

2157
01:26:58,953 --> 01:27:00,321
You are a hero!

2158
01:27:00,655 --> 01:27:03,741
You deserve this.

2159
01:27:03,741 --> 01:27:05,626
So, you know,
do you think that you could

2160
01:27:05,626 --> 01:27:09,130
just, you know, pop a good word
in there for me, you know?

2161
01:27:09,130 --> 01:27:11,466
I mean, my year's
almost done here.

2162
01:27:19,307 --> 01:27:22,310
Let me tell you
something, Jack.

2163
01:27:22,310 --> 01:27:26,814
Everyone is gonna want to
give you the same advice...

2164
01:27:26,814 --> 01:27:30,318
tell you that you
have to pay your dues...

2165
01:27:30,318 --> 01:27:32,770
ask you to do them a favor.

2166
01:27:32,770 --> 01:27:34,655
"Do this for us."

2167
01:27:34,906 --> 01:27:37,992
They all want you to play
by the rules, Jack.

2168
01:27:38,493 --> 01:27:40,995
Their rules.

2169
01:27:40,995 --> 01:27:42,997
Well, save that
candy-striped shit

2170
01:27:42,997 --> 01:27:45,500
for the Wall Street
wimps...

2171
01:27:45,500 --> 01:27:49,003
because
this town is a jungle.

2172
01:27:49,504 --> 01:27:51,005
This is your inner city.

2173
01:27:51,005 --> 01:27:54,509
These are your mean streets.

2174
01:27:54,509 --> 01:27:59,013
And the only interests
that you need to protect...

2175
01:27:59,013 --> 01:28:01,015
are yours.

2176
01:28:01,516 --> 01:28:04,018
And the only needs...

2177
01:28:04,519 --> 01:28:06,938
that you have to serve...

2178
01:28:06,938 --> 01:28:09,357
are yours.

2179
01:28:10,641 --> 01:28:11,642
So the only question

2180
01:28:12,143 --> 01:28:15,646
that you need to answer
is this--

2181
01:28:15,646 --> 01:28:18,149
And think about this, Jack--

2182
01:28:21,369 --> 01:28:24,739
What do you really want?

2183
01:28:41,422 --> 01:28:43,925
Well...

2184
01:28:44,425 --> 01:28:46,427
I have to go to
a meeting, Jack, so...

2185
01:28:46,427 --> 01:28:48,896
Ok.

2186
01:28:48,896 --> 01:28:51,432
