00:03:18,737 --> 00:03:21,449
Jessica, did Miss Hogarth
ask you to stop by?

00:03:21,532 --> 00:03:22,783
Yep.

35
00:03:22,866 --> 00:03:24,118
- You're lying, aren't you?
- Yep.

36

Got anything for me?

I thought you didn't like or trust me.

00:03:27,705 --> 00:03:29,332
Oh, come on,
I meant lawyers in general.

39
00:03:29,415 --> 00:03:31,709
- "Scumbag henchmen for corporate America."
- Well...

40
00:03:31,792 --> 00:03:33,836
We just hired a full-time investigator.

41
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:35,588
Whoever he is,
he's not as good as me.

42
00:03:35,671 --> 00:03:38,841
Hence me having offered you the job,
which you rejected.

43
00:03:38,925 --> 00:03:41,928
[sighs] Wasn't personal.
I just prefer freelance. No ties.

So you said,
with an impressive string of expletives.

45
00:03:44,555 --> 00:03:46,015
[Jessica] Okay, is being drunk an excuse?

46
00:03:46,099 --> 00:03:48,017
[Hogarth] You know,
it's really about professionalism.

47
00:03:48,101 --> 00:03:49,893
You are erratic and you are volatile.

48
00:03:49,978 --> 00:03:53,522
[Jessica] Effective. You've brought me
eight jobs no one could deliver on.

49
00:03:53,606 --> 00:03:54,607
I did.

50
00:03:54,690 --> 00:03:57,860
And that is why
I have overlooked several complaints,

51
00:03:57,944 --> 00:04:00,821
and have kept your methods confidential.

52
00:04:01,948 --> 00:04:05,034
You're not protecting me.
You need my methods.

53

I'm not gonna beg you for a case.

54
00:04:08,997 --> 00:04:11,832
I will ask you, though, very strongly.

55
00:04:14,752 --> 00:04:18,589
I need a summons served to
the owner of several gentlemen's clubs.

56
00:04:18,672 --> 00:04:20,341
His name is Gregory Spheeris.

57
00:04:22,676 --> 00:04:26,430
An exotic dancer fell off the stage
when a pole came loose.

58
00:04:26,514 --> 00:04:29,517
Severe concussion,
some permanent brain damage.

59
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:31,560
Spheeris claims
she was always that stupid.

60
00:04:31,644 --> 00:04:35,273
- And you're repping who?
- The dancer, of course.

61
00:04:36,065 --> 00:04:39,527
The poor, brain-damaged dancer. And?

62
00:04:40,111 --> 00:04:42,405
Other parties interested
in Spheeris' property.

63
00:04:42,488 --> 00:04:44,865
Phew. I questioned my whole worldview
for a second there.

64
00:04:44,948 --> 00:04:47,785
Spheeris' bodyguards
make him very difficult to serve.

65
00:04:47,868 --> 00:04:49,162
Your specialty.

66
00:04:49,245 --> 00:04:52,373
This has gone a long way
toward me liking and trusting you.

00:05:13,894 --> 00:05:18,816
Jamshahi is screaming about some meeting
he has with Mr. Spheeris,

00:05:18,899 --> 00:05:20,318
and I don't know where or when.

I don't know, a lunch, a dinner?
I can't read his handwriting.

Oh, no.
Now, here he's coming.

Tomorrow, 7:00 p.m.?</i>

82
00:05:32,121 --> 00:05:35,166

- That has to be it. Where?

We just flew in from Omaha

Honey, Hope's not missing
if she still calls us once a week.

She could be in a cult!

Come on in.

137
00:12:48,974 --> 00:12:52,227
- Looks like you stripped your screws.
- Wouldn't be the first time.

<i>Start at the beginning.</i>

139
00:12:54,855 --> 00:13:00,152
Hope is at NYU on an athletic scholarship.
Track and field, team captain.

140
00:13:01,403 --> 00:13:04,447
A month ago she called
to say that she was taking a break,

141
00:13:04,532 --> 00:13:06,449
which is not like her at all.

142
00:13:06,534 --> 00:13:09,244
She moved out of her apartment,
we don't know where.

143
00:13:09,327 --> 00:13:12,790
When she quit the team,
we got on the plane.

00:13:12,873 --> 00:13:14,625
You have a level?
I could hang this straight.

145

She doesn't have a level, Bob.

146
00:13:17,210 --> 00:13:18,712
We went to the police.

147
00:13:18,796 --> 00:13:21,632
They said there was no evidence
of a crime being committed,

148
00:13:21,715 --> 00:13:24,593
and someone there
recommended that we contact you.

149
00:13:25,594 --> 00:13:27,304
The police referred you to me?

150
00:13:27,387 --> 00:13:29,932
- Why? Would that be unusual?
- Not at all.

151
00:13:31,058 --> 00:13:32,768
Has Hope had any problems in the past?

152
00:13:32,851 --> 00:13:36,939
God, no.
She's always been incredibly disciplined.

153
00:13:37,022 --> 00:13:38,148
How about epoxy?

154
00:13:38,231 --> 00:13:39,567
I could glue the screws in.
It'd be temporary, but...

155
00:13:39,650 --> 00:13:41,902
Stop with the damn door, Bob!

156
00:13:41,985 --> 00:13:45,781
And leave a woman living alone
in this city with no lock and no door?

157
00:13:45,864 --> 00:13:47,032
It's not safe!

158
00:13:56,917 --> 00:13:59,419
[sighs] That won't work.

I charge hourly, plus expenses.

160
00:14:04,424 --> 00:14:05,968
I'll get a standard contract.

161
00:14:20,899 --> 00:14:22,985
Shlottmans.

162

<i>Bob, general contractor.
Barbara, accountant.</i>

<i>Not wealthy, but legit.</i>

164

168
00:14:40,628 --> 00:14:42,462
<i>Friend.</i>

169
00:14:51,930 --> 00:14:53,348
[woman] I'm playing tonight
if you want to come.

170
00:14:53,431 --> 00:14:55,058
[man] Yeah, definitely.

171
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:11,533
[metal clings]

172
00:15:15,203 --> 00:15:16,496
It was open.

173
00:15:18,081 --> 00:15:19,792
Stop shooting.

174
00:15:19,875 --> 00:15:23,921
I'm making an experimental time lapse film
of a year in my life, so...

175
00:15:24,004 --> 00:15:25,547
Riveting.

176
00:15:25,631 --> 00:15:27,132
I found him on Craigslist.

177
00:15:27,215 --> 00:15:30,636
I suddenly needed a roommate, so...
Thanks a lot, Hope.

178
00:15:30,719 --> 00:15:32,304
You're pissed at her.

179
00:15:33,263 --> 00:15:35,598
Seriously, lose the camera, Coppola.

180
00:15:35,683 --> 00:15:38,852
I can't, it's a continuous shot.
That means that there's no cuts.

181
00:15:39,602 --> 00:15:41,396
Look at that, I found a cut.

182
00:15:41,479 --> 00:15:43,065
Oh! You destroyed my art!

183
00:15:43,148 --> 00:15:46,193
[sighs] Mercy killing.
Where's Hope's stuff?

184
00:15:46,276 --> 00:15:49,905
She told me to sell it for rent.
Made a whole 98 bucks.

185
00:15:49,988 --> 00:15:52,407
Well, there's a box of her leftover junk
in my closet.

186
00:15:54,617 --> 00:15:56,036
Go get it.

187
00:15:56,578 --> 00:15:57,830
Okay.

188
00:15:59,539 --> 00:16:02,918
She's not missing, you know.
She's just holed up with that guy.

189
00:16:03,001 --> 00:16:04,211
There's a guy?

190
00:16:04,294 --> 00:16:07,715
Of course there's a guy.
Why else would a best friend crap on you?

191
00:16:08,841 --> 00:16:11,093
She didn't mention him to her parents.

192
00:16:11,176 --> 00:16:12,845
They only talk about track.

193
00:16:12,928 --> 00:16:15,848
This guy have a name? A job?

194
00:16:15,931 --> 00:16:18,641
[Mei] All she'd tell me was,
"He's amazing!"

195
00:16:18,726 --> 00:16:20,853
I mean, did she think I was gonna
steal him or something?

196
00:16:20,936 --> 00:16:23,814
Look, she met a guy.
Case solved.

197
00:16:26,608 --> 00:16:28,819
You turn that thing on,
I'll pull your underwear through your eye.

Yo! Chop chop!
Quick like a bunny!

Where's my car?

203
00:16:56,304 --> 00:16:57,765
Be back in my place in ten.

[Jessica] Excuse me.

00:17:15,866 --> 00:17:17,826
I said excuse me.

208
00:17:17,910 --> 00:17:19,452
Do you know the way to
the Chrysler Building?

209
00:17:19,536 --> 00:17:22,205
It's called Google Maps, moron.

You're... one of them.

[grunts]

216
00:17:49,691 --> 00:17:52,778
You know, you'll spend less
settling this lawsuit

217
00:17:52,861 --> 00:17:54,905
than you did on those hair plugs.

218
00:17:54,988 --> 00:17:56,114
You're not normal.

219
00:17:57,157 --> 00:17:59,451
It's people like you
that give people like you a bad name.

220
00:17:59,534 --> 00:18:01,369
Take the damn summons, Spheeris.

221
00:18:01,453 --> 00:18:04,497
No, no. If you even touch me,
I'll tell the world about you.

222
00:18:04,581 --> 00:18:06,749
There'll be nowhere to hide.

223
00:18:06,834 --> 00:18:09,711
Do I look like I'm hiding? No.

224
00:18:09,795 --> 00:18:10,838
You wanna know why?

225
00:18:10,921 --> 00:18:13,215
Because no one wants to know.

226
00:18:13,298 --> 00:18:15,092
They want to feel safe.

227
00:18:15,175 --> 00:18:17,970
They'd rather call you crazy
than admit that I can lift this car,

228
00:18:18,053 --> 00:18:21,139
or that I can melt your insides
with my laser eyes...

229
00:18:21,223 --> 00:18:23,266
which won't leave a trace.

You work this late so you can return calls
without actually reaching people.

245
00:19:44,306 --> 00:19:45,515
[Hogarth] <i>Well, I reached you.</i>

246

- I received your message.
<i>- So cut a check.</i>

247
00:19:48,936 --> 00:19:51,313
And I also received a call
from Spheeris' attorney.

248
00:19:51,396 --> 00:19:53,440
Spheeris claims you, and I quote,

249
00:19:53,523 --> 00:19:57,735
"lifted his car overhead
and threatened him with your laser eyes."

250
00:19:57,819 --> 00:19:58,861
Pathetic.

251
00:19:58,946 --> 00:20:02,615
<i>- Did you threaten him?</i>
- Yep, with my laser eyes.

252
00:20:02,699 --> 00:20:04,910
And he believed that bullshit.

253
00:20:04,993 --> 00:20:07,120
<i>I could have said my hands were blenders.</i>

254

<i>Clearly, there's no IQ test
for owning a strip club.</i>

Well, people believe
some pretty strange things these days.

256
00:20:12,375 --> 00:20:14,586
Look, if you're gonna call me volatile
or whatever else,

257
00:20:14,669 --> 00:20:15,921
I'm really not in the mood.

258
00:20:16,004 --> 00:20:17,672
No, no.

259
00:20:17,755 --> 00:20:20,592
No, it sounds like it was very calculated.

260
00:20:20,675 --> 00:20:22,302
Only wish I could have been there.

261
00:20:23,761 --> 00:20:25,388
Was that a compliment?

262
00:20:26,306 --> 00:20:27,765
I'll notify payroll.

[man] It's a pleasure talking to you.

268
00:21:56,313 --> 00:21:58,815
[man] You could drink that out of a glass.

269
00:22:04,154 --> 00:22:06,531
This whiskey's not good enough
to put in a glass.

270
00:22:07,865 --> 00:22:10,077
Yeah? I've got better stuff in there.

I've seen you around here,
but you never come inside.

I buy in bulk.

It's ladies' night.
New promotion I'm running.

[scoffs] No, it's not.

It is now.

276
00:22:26,259 --> 00:22:27,260
Why?

277
00:22:27,969 --> 00:22:32,724
You're local, you're hot, drinking alone.
Tends to attract customers.

00:22:32,807 --> 00:22:35,268
But hey, don't do me any favors.

Still ladies' night?

286
00:23:08,676 --> 00:23:10,262
Make it a double.

287
00:23:14,724 --> 00:23:16,684
Lot of booze for such a small woman.

288
00:23:18,561 --> 00:23:20,897
I don't get asked
on a lot of second dates.

289

[chuckles softly]

290
00:23:23,816 --> 00:23:25,568
How long you been doing this?

291
00:23:26,944 --> 00:23:28,280
A while.

You from around here?
You got family here? Friends?

I got regulars.

They're all hard.

Pops always said,

297
00:23:45,547 --> 00:23:47,757
if you don't feel good going to work,
you should find new work.

298
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:49,926
I did that. I'm working the new work.

299
00:23:50,009 --> 00:23:52,220
Yeah? What kind of business you in?

300
00:23:55,097 --> 00:23:56,974
[clicks tongue] Right.

301
00:23:57,058 --> 00:23:59,769
- You only ask questions.
- I'm still waiting on answers.

302
00:24:00,937 --> 00:24:02,439
Ladies first.

303
00:24:13,283 --> 00:24:14,409
You're a P.I.?

304
00:24:14,492 --> 00:24:18,538
I'm just trying to make a living.
You know, booze costs money. Usually.

305
00:24:19,372 --> 00:24:21,458
There's better ways to hustle
than digging in people's business.

306
00:24:21,541 --> 00:24:23,585
It's the only thing I'm good at.

307
00:24:23,668 --> 00:24:25,878
- How good?
- A natural.

308
00:24:25,962 --> 00:24:27,171
Yeah?

309
00:24:28,506 --> 00:24:30,383
So what have you detected?

310
00:24:30,467 --> 00:24:34,304
Well, I can tell
by the residue on this bar

311
00:24:34,387 --> 00:24:38,308
that four years ago,
a man named Horace had buffalo wings.

312
00:24:39,183 --> 00:24:40,810
His name was Melvin.

313
00:24:44,856 --> 00:24:48,067
I stand in dark alleys and wait
to take pictures of people boning.

314
00:24:49,527 --> 00:24:51,863
Except you been watching me like a hawk
since you walked in.

315
00:24:51,946 --> 00:24:53,072
Force of habit.

316
00:24:54,657 --> 00:24:56,868
Or it's your way of flirting.

317
00:24:56,951 --> 00:24:59,996
I don't flirt. But you do.

318
00:25:00,079 --> 00:25:02,374
Not for sport. It's got purpose.

319
00:25:02,457 --> 00:25:05,167
Like getting customers to drink more.
Tip more.

320
00:25:08,212 --> 00:25:09,631
So what else ya got, Sherlock?

321
00:25:10,673 --> 00:25:11,966
All right.

322
00:25:13,175 --> 00:25:17,514
A drunk spills on your shirt,
pukes on your shoe, and you roll with it.

323
00:25:18,515 --> 00:25:21,768
But break or scratch something?
He's toast.

324
00:25:22,727 --> 00:25:26,188
I've never seen a dive bar this clean.

325
00:25:26,273 --> 00:25:28,024
Because you care about it.

326
00:25:28,107 --> 00:25:29,734
More than anything.

327
00:25:30,735 --> 00:25:32,779
Maybe anyone.

328
00:25:32,862 --> 00:25:34,531
There's history here.

329
00:25:35,990 --> 00:25:37,199
Memories.

330
00:25:38,868 --> 00:25:41,954
Something personal, but private.

331
00:25:42,038 --> 00:25:44,416
So no photos or memorabilia.

332
00:25:45,583 --> 00:25:47,544
But you also like women.

333
00:25:47,627 --> 00:25:49,504
Temporarily, at least.

334
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:53,215
And they like you.

335
00:25:54,133 --> 00:25:56,135
See, now that sounded like flirting to me.

336
00:25:56,218 --> 00:25:59,472
Again, I don't flirt.
I just say what I want.

337
00:26:01,057 --> 00:26:02,684
And what do you want?

338
00:26:05,812 --> 00:26:07,397
[both moaning]

339
00:26:16,531 --> 00:26:18,074
- [grunts] My bad, my bad.
- [grunts]

340
00:26:18,157 --> 00:26:19,826
It's okay. It's okay, I won't break.

341
00:26:19,909 --> 00:26:21,953
Yeah, you will.

342
00:26:22,662 --> 00:26:24,622
[sighing]

343
00:26:39,679 --> 00:26:40,888
Here.

344
00:27:12,128 --> 00:27:14,506
[sighs heavily]

345
00:27:23,723 --> 00:27:25,057
[sighs]

346
00:28:05,765 --> 00:28:07,308
[sniffles]

347
00:28:07,391 --> 00:28:08,851
[exhales sharply]

348
00:28:33,876 --> 00:28:35,044
Sorry.

349
00:28:51,603 --> 00:28:52,979
[retching]

350
00:29:08,703 --> 00:29:10,538
[indistinct arguing]

351
00:29:12,457 --> 00:29:13,916
[man] You didn't do it perfectly.

352
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,878
You didn't do it perfectly,
so now it's all your fault.

353
00:29:16,961 --> 00:29:18,212
[woman] Oh, yeah? Yeah?

354
00:29:18,295 --> 00:29:19,338
Assholes!

355
00:29:19,421 --> 00:29:20,715
- [cell phone ringing]
- [man] And I just noticed

356
00:29:20,798 --> 00:29:21,924
you put all my laundry...

357
00:29:22,008 --> 00:29:23,510
[woman] All I asked...

358
00:29:27,179 --> 00:29:28,430
Alias Investigations.

359
00:29:28,515 --> 00:29:30,892
[Barbara] <i>It's Barb Shlottman,</i>
<i>Hope's mom.</i>

360
00:29:30,975 --> 00:29:32,894
Yeah. Yes. Hi, I was just...

361
00:29:32,977 --> 00:29:35,647
<i>What's wrong? You sound funny.
Is it... Is it Hope?</i>

362
00:29:35,730 --> 00:29:39,776
No, it was just a long night
researching your case.

363
00:29:41,110 --> 00:29:44,781
Um, Hope made some recent charges
on her credit card.

364
00:29:44,864 --> 00:29:46,198
[Barbara] <i>She never uses that card.</i>

365
00:29:46,282 --> 00:29:49,786
<i>We just gave it to her for emergencies.
But we raised her to be frugal.</i>

366
00:29:49,869 --> 00:29:53,122
[Jessica] <i>So she didn't mention</i>
<i>wanting to buy anything special?</i>

367
00:29:53,205 --> 00:29:56,083
[Barbara] <i>No. Why? What did she buy?</i>

368
00:29:56,167 --> 00:29:57,710
[Jessica] <i>Nothing unusual.</i>

369
00:30:03,007 --> 00:30:06,135
[Jessica in voiceover] <i>Hope's going</i>
<i>overboard to make her boyfriend happy.</i>

370
00:30:07,386 --> 00:30:11,057
<i>She's either an idiot in love,
or she's being conned.</i>

371
00:30:13,309 --> 00:30:15,728
<i>Which amount to
pretty much the same thing.</i>

372
00:30:36,583 --> 00:30:37,750
No.

373
00:30:37,834 --> 00:30:40,211
[breathing heavily] No way.

374
00:31:01,190 --> 00:31:03,317
I'm sorry, ma'am,
we're not open for dinner yet.

375
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:05,236
- Didn't this used to be Il Rosso?
- Yes.

376
00:31:05,319 --> 00:31:09,490
Niku opened eight months ago.
May I make a reservation for you?

377
00:31:09,574 --> 00:31:11,075
Have you seen this girl?

378
00:31:12,201 --> 00:31:13,244
May I ask why?

379
00:31:13,327 --> 00:31:15,454
I'm a private investigator.

380
00:31:16,205 --> 00:31:18,415
- I don't want any more trouble.
- Any more?

381
00:31:18,499 --> 00:31:19,959
So she was here.

382
00:31:20,627 --> 00:31:21,794
Last Tuesday.

383
00:31:23,379 --> 00:31:24,505
Was she alone?

384
00:31:24,589 --> 00:31:27,759
- You should really speak to my manager.
- Just tell me what happened.

385
00:31:31,262 --> 00:31:35,975
Her companion wanted
a particular table in the back.

386
00:31:36,809 --> 00:31:39,353
There was a couple already seated there.

387
00:31:39,436 --> 00:31:42,690
But I lost my mind or something.
I told them to leave.

388
00:31:43,691 --> 00:31:44,859
No, that's not possible.

389
00:31:44,942 --> 00:31:48,863
What's not possible is our sommelier
comping him a $500 bottle.

390
00:31:48,946 --> 00:31:52,158
And when he ordered his favorite dish,
from Il Rosso,

391
00:31:52,241 --> 00:31:57,204
our chef actually hunted down the recipe
from Il Rosso's old chef.

392
00:31:57,914 --> 00:31:59,624
[indistinct conversations]

393
00:32:16,557 --> 00:32:20,436
[man in English accent]
To our anniversary. You'll love it.

394
00:32:20,519 --> 00:32:21,603
I will love it.

395
00:32:22,647 --> 00:32:23,690
Then smile.

396
00:32:23,773 --> 00:32:26,192
I can't imagine why he came
to an Asian fusion restaurant

397
00:32:26,275 --> 00:32:30,112
- to order classic Italian pasta...
- Amatriciana.

398
00:32:31,072 --> 00:32:32,699
You know him?

399
00:32:32,782 --> 00:32:35,409
He's not coming back, is he?

400
00:32:35,492 --> 00:32:36,869
Ma'am?

401
00:32:48,005 --> 00:32:50,549
Birch Street, Higgins Drive...

402
00:32:54,887 --> 00:32:55,888
Shit.

403
00:33:17,076 --> 00:33:18,494
Miss Jones. What is it?

404
00:33:18,577 --> 00:33:22,498
Who gave you my name?
Which police officer told you about me?

405
00:33:22,581 --> 00:33:24,792
- What's going on? Is it Hope?
- Is she okay?

406
00:33:24,876 --> 00:33:27,962
Did you get the cop's name
who referred me?

407
00:33:28,045 --> 00:33:29,463
It wasn't a policeman.

408
00:33:29,546 --> 00:33:32,091
You said someone at the station...

409
00:33:32,174 --> 00:33:36,512
- He was filing a complaint.
- Or paying a ticket. What does it matter?

410
00:33:36,595 --> 00:33:37,722
What did he say?

411
00:33:38,389 --> 00:33:42,852
He said he overheard our conversation
with the desk sergeant about Hope,

412
00:33:42,935 --> 00:33:44,145
and suggested we come to you.

413
00:33:44,228 --> 00:33:46,188
He had a nice accent, English.

414
00:33:47,398 --> 00:33:50,067
Pack. Go home.

415
00:33:51,152 --> 00:33:52,194
Get the hell out of here.

416
00:33:52,278 --> 00:33:53,863
What? Why? Who is this guy?

417
00:33:53,946 --> 00:33:55,281
[Barbara]
Does he have our daughter?

418
00:33:55,364 --> 00:33:56,866
Don't let anyone near you, just go!

419
00:33:56,949 --> 00:33:58,325
Are you going to find her?

420
00:33:59,576 --> 00:34:02,246
I need one coach ticket
on the next flight to Hong Kong.

421
00:34:02,329 --> 00:34:04,081
[man] <i>That would be departing</i>
<i>in three hours.</i>

422
00:34:04,165 --> 00:34:05,249
I'll take it.

423
00:34:05,332 --> 00:34:07,209
<i>Perfect.
I just need your credit card information.</i>

424
00:34:07,293 --> 00:34:09,086
Okay, it's a MasterCard.

425
00:34:10,546 --> 00:34:15,843
The number is
5-2-7-4-9-3-3-2-0-6-8...

426
00:34:15,927 --> 00:34:18,470
That's Hope Shlottman, two T's.

427
00:34:19,430 --> 00:34:20,973
<i>I'm sorry, that card was declined.</i>

428
00:34:21,057 --> 00:34:22,183
Shit!

429
00:34:23,350 --> 00:34:25,978
Okay.
Can you just hold the ticket for me?

430
00:34:26,062 --> 00:34:27,521
<i>We don't hold tickets.</i>

431
00:34:30,357 --> 00:34:31,859
Okay.

432
00:34:33,444 --> 00:34:35,154
[dialing]

433
00:34:35,237 --> 00:34:36,655
[line ringing]

434
00:34:38,199 --> 00:34:39,616
[Hogarth] <i>Yes?</i>

435
00:34:39,700 --> 00:34:41,743
I need to get paid
for the Spheeris job now.

436
00:34:41,828 --> 00:34:44,330
I put it through payroll.
It takes a few days. You know that.

437
00:34:44,413 --> 00:34:46,165
Okay, then I need a loan.

438
00:34:46,248 --> 00:34:48,793
<i>That's not how I conduct business.
You will have to ask a friend.</i>

439
00:34:48,876 --> 00:34:50,211
I don't have any goddamn friends.

440
00:34:50,294 --> 00:34:52,629
[scoffs] I'm shocked.

441
00:34:52,713 --> 00:34:53,840
Jessica?

442
00:34:55,967 --> 00:34:58,886
Here you are.
I was waiting downstairs.

443
00:34:59,761 --> 00:35:00,972
Oh.

444
00:35:04,892 --> 00:35:08,855
We should go.
We'll be late for our reservation.

445
00:35:08,938 --> 00:35:12,149
- And whose fault is that?
- [chuckles lightly]

446
00:35:24,912 --> 00:35:26,413
- [cell phone beeps]
- [sighs]

[line ringing]

448
00:35:41,846 --> 00:35:43,430
[Malcolm grunts]

449
00:35:43,514 --> 00:35:44,806
[sighs]

450
00:35:46,558 --> 00:35:48,644
- You look bad.
- I need money.

451
00:35:49,770 --> 00:35:51,397
You can have my TV.

452
00:35:53,315 --> 00:35:55,192
Thanks, Malcolm.
You keep it.

453
00:35:57,319 --> 00:35:59,113
- I stole it.
- I figured.

454
00:36:06,162 --> 00:36:07,746
[Trish] Can we at least try
to get Madeleine Albright?

455
00:36:07,829 --> 00:36:10,749
It's a lifestyle show, Trish.
Our audiences tune out for politics.

456
00:36:10,832 --> 00:36:13,085
- They do not.
- Okay, I do.

457
00:36:13,169 --> 00:36:14,545
I want to meet Madeleine Albright.

458
00:36:14,628 --> 00:36:15,837
I want to meet Channing Tatum,

459
00:36:15,922 --> 00:36:17,256
but I've never tried
to book him on the show.

460
00:36:17,339 --> 00:36:19,841
Yes, you have.
He said no.

461
00:36:23,012 --> 00:36:26,223
Oh, I'm sorry, Zack, it's late and...

462
00:36:26,307 --> 00:36:28,642
Yeah. Yeah, we'll pick this up
at the station tomorrow.

463
00:36:28,725 --> 00:36:29,851
Thank you.

464
00:36:29,936 --> 00:36:31,020
Come on.

465
00:36:33,772 --> 00:36:35,983
- Thanks, Zack.
- Yeah. Nice.

466
00:36:43,074 --> 00:36:44,450
Bye, guys.

- [door closes]
- [door locks]

468
00:37:10,101 --> 00:37:11,393
You could've used the door.

469
00:37:11,477 --> 00:37:14,981
I wasn't sure you'd answer.
It's important.

470
00:37:16,023 --> 00:37:17,608
It must be.

471
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:21,445
It's for a case.

472
00:37:21,528 --> 00:37:23,322
Right.

473
00:37:23,405 --> 00:37:26,033
You became a private eye.

474
00:37:26,117 --> 00:37:27,618
You've been keeping tabs on me?

475
00:37:27,701 --> 00:37:30,621
Making sure you weren't dead,
since you never called.

476
00:37:32,206 --> 00:37:33,374
I need money.

[scoffs]

478
00:37:36,961 --> 00:37:38,504
Wow. Uh...

479
00:37:39,796 --> 00:37:41,215
I don't even know what to say.

00:37:41,298 --> 00:37:42,841
- It's important.
- You said.

481
00:37:42,924 --> 00:37:46,762
But I don't hear from you for months,
six months, actually...

482
00:37:46,845 --> 00:37:49,348
- I needed breathing room.
- You shut me out.

483
00:37:49,431 --> 00:37:52,226
And now you show up here asking for money?

484
00:37:52,309 --> 00:37:53,352
This was a bad idea.

485
00:37:53,435 --> 00:37:57,398
No, you talk to me.
You tell me what the hell is so important.

486
00:38:00,109 --> 00:38:01,193
He's back.

487
00:38:04,571 --> 00:38:06,032
It's been a year, Jess.

488
00:38:07,033 --> 00:38:08,575
You saw him die.

489
00:38:09,618 --> 00:38:12,997
You saw his death certificate.
This is just your PTSD...

490
00:38:13,080 --> 00:38:16,292
It's not my goddamn PTSD.

491
00:38:16,375 --> 00:38:18,335
Are you still having nightmares?

492
00:38:19,295 --> 00:38:20,546
Flashbacks?

493
00:38:23,049 --> 00:38:24,466
[sighs]

494
00:38:25,759 --> 00:38:27,261
You need to go back to that therapist.

495
00:38:27,344 --> 00:38:29,846
That quack that had me
reciting street names from back home?

496
00:38:29,930 --> 00:38:31,473
A proven method for managing PTSD.

497
00:38:31,557 --> 00:38:33,725
Two hundred bucks for "Birch Street,
Cobalt Lane, Bullshit Drive."

498
00:38:33,809 --> 00:38:36,437
- I told you I'd pay for it.
- Jesus Christ, Trish!

499
00:38:37,438 --> 00:38:38,730
He's back.

500
00:38:39,690 --> 00:38:42,776
He sent clients to me,
this couple from Omaha.

501
00:38:42,859 --> 00:38:44,611
He took their daughter.

502
00:38:45,696 --> 00:38:46,738
Why her?

503
00:38:46,822 --> 00:38:50,284
- Is she gifted?
- A gifted athlete, maybe.

504
00:38:50,367 --> 00:38:51,868
Next best thing?
I don't know.

505
00:38:51,952 --> 00:38:57,166
But remember I told you
he had that one month anniversary night?

506
00:38:57,249 --> 00:39:00,294
And now one month
from the day he took Hope,

507
00:39:00,377 --> 00:39:01,545
he's doing...

508
00:39:02,671 --> 00:39:06,800
the lingerie, the gift, the restaurant.

509
00:39:06,883 --> 00:39:07,926
The hotel?

510
00:39:10,971 --> 00:39:12,514
I'm calling the police.

511
00:39:12,598 --> 00:39:14,266
They can't help, Trish.

512
00:39:15,392 --> 00:39:17,018
You know what he can do.

513
00:39:18,437 --> 00:39:20,439
You know what he made me do.

514
00:39:21,898 --> 00:39:23,234
So you're running.

515
00:39:24,193 --> 00:39:26,237
Yeah, I sure as hell am.

516
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:28,239
If he gets a hold of me again...

517
00:39:31,742 --> 00:39:32,951
Trish...

518
00:39:33,034 --> 00:39:35,121
If you leave that girl with him, and...

519
00:39:35,204 --> 00:39:37,748
What would you have me do?
What exactly should I do?

520
00:39:37,831 --> 00:39:39,541
We'll figure out a way to protect you.

521
00:39:39,625 --> 00:39:42,961
We? He's coming for me, not you.

522
00:39:43,044 --> 00:39:44,213
I know!

523
00:39:45,881 --> 00:39:46,923
You don't.

524
00:39:47,007 --> 00:39:49,135
I know one thing,
you are far better equipped

525
00:39:49,218 --> 00:39:52,721
to deal with that animal
than some innocent girl from Omaha.

526
00:39:56,808 --> 00:40:00,937
You're still the person
who tried to do something.

527
00:40:03,357 --> 00:40:05,066
Tried and failed.

528
00:40:06,318 --> 00:40:08,195
That's what started this.

529
00:40:10,531 --> 00:40:13,074
I was never the hero
that you wanted me to be.

530
00:40:16,787 --> 00:40:17,954
I'll get your money.

Five hours and 21 minutes.

Is that my dad?

You have to get her
as far away as you can.

556
00:44:26,119 --> 00:44:28,705
Check out of your hotel,
and go directly to my office.
