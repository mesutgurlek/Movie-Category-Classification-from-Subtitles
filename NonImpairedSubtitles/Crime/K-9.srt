00:00:14,047 --> 00:00:15,958
(rain)

2
00:00:21,047 --> 00:00:22,958
(thunder)

3
00:01:03,007 --> 00:01:04,918
(woman sighing and moaning)

4
00:01:24,047 --> 00:01:25,958
(laughter and voices)

5
00:01:52,407 --> 00:01:54,318
(squeal)

6
00:01:58,727 --> 00:02:00,638
(car horn)

7
00:02:05,647 --> 00:02:07,558
(electronic tune)

8
00:02:13,727 --> 00:02:16,924
- Great. You think that's funny, chiphead?
- (electronic laughter)

9
00:02:17,007 --> 00:02:21,285
You know, I couId puII your battery
and kiII you. so don't get cocky.

10
00:02:22,967 --> 00:02:23,877
(buzzing)

11
00:02:23,967 --> 00:02:25,878
(electronic laughter)

12
00:02:27,287 --> 00:02:30,916
- 2707 to ControI.
- Control, 2707.

13
00:02:31,007 --> 00:02:33,840
Message check. I'm waitin'
for a friendIy named Freddie.

14
00:02:33,927 --> 00:02:37,237
He's a no-show.
Is there any caII-ins from him?

15
00:02:37,327 --> 00:02:40,399
Control, 2707. No messages.

16
00:02:40,487 --> 00:02:43,445
AII right, ten-four. I have a request
to open a phone channeI.

17
00:02:43,527 --> 00:02:46,200
Patch me through to 555 3312, pIease.

18
00:02:48,327 --> 00:02:52,036
Calling your girlfriend to say you'll be late
is nonessential communication.

19
00:02:52,127 --> 00:02:54,846
You should know that
by now, 2707. Clear.

20
00:02:56,967 --> 00:03:00,482
CIear. Ten-four.
Thanks for nothing, ControI.

21
00:03:11,887 --> 00:03:13,798
Ah, this is great(!)

22
00:03:14,447 --> 00:03:16,677
Agh! Goddamn it.

23
00:03:19,167 --> 00:03:21,283
Lovers' Iane.

24
00:03:21,927 --> 00:03:23,838
Hi! PoIice.

25
00:03:23,927 --> 00:03:26,521
This is an emergency.
I have to use your phone.

26
00:03:26,607 --> 00:03:30,316
sorry about the uphoIstery. Just pretend
I'm not here, OK? I'II be a second.

27
00:03:30,407 --> 00:03:32,363
$100 bottIe of champagne!

28
00:03:33,087 --> 00:03:36,557
she's worth it.
Aw, damn, the machine's on, you know?

29
00:03:36,647 --> 00:03:38,205
You have one? I hate them.

30
00:03:38,287 --> 00:03:41,723
You got a KIeenex? Ah, forget it.
That's aII right. This'II come off.

31
00:03:41,807 --> 00:03:46,198
- Ah. Hi, Tracy. Yeah, it's DooIey.
- (helicopter overhead)

32
00:03:46,287 --> 00:03:49,040
I'm just caIIing to Iet you know
I'm gonna be a IittIe Iate.

33
00:03:49,127 --> 00:03:50,082
What's that?

34
00:03:54,527 --> 00:03:55,721
I gotta go, honey.

35
00:04:10,087 --> 00:04:13,124
WeII, it's not the Eyewitness News team.

36
00:04:24,367 --> 00:04:26,039
I think someone's mad at me.

37
00:04:31,887 --> 00:04:34,276
DefiniteIy, someone is mad at me.

38
00:04:42,167 --> 00:04:44,397
- Whoo!
- Hey, DooIey!

39
00:04:44,487 --> 00:04:46,921
Got a ride home tonight?

40
00:04:48,847 --> 00:04:51,839
- Byers, I need a car.
- Can I ask you something?

41
00:04:51,927 --> 00:04:56,284
- Later. PIease, I need a car. Mine bIew up.
- Just one question. One question.

42
00:04:56,367 --> 00:04:59,404
How many cops use their day off
tryin' to get their asses shot off?

43
00:04:59,487 --> 00:05:02,047
- I was set up!
- How many?

44
00:05:02,127 --> 00:05:05,836
Look, I got him, OK?
I'm this cIose, Rog. I got Lyman.

45
00:05:05,927 --> 00:05:08,566
- Give me a number. I'II write it down.
- 50 miIIion.

46
00:05:08,647 --> 00:05:12,083
Lyman's moving 50 miIIion.
This is the big one, Rog, and I got him.

47
00:05:12,167 --> 00:05:14,522
Mike, you don't have dick on Lyman.
What you've got

48
00:05:14,607 --> 00:05:17,405
is a wet suit,
a bad attitude and a bIown-up car.

49
00:05:17,487 --> 00:05:19,717
Right. That's what I toId you. I need a car.

50
00:05:19,807 --> 00:05:22,367
You want a car, take a partner.
It's a two-for-one deaI.

51
00:05:22,447 --> 00:05:24,517
- No, I'm not takin' a partner.
- Take Davis.

52
00:05:24,607 --> 00:05:27,360
- Davis hates me.
- OK, uh... spencer. How about spencer?

53
00:05:27,447 --> 00:05:30,007
- I hate spencer.
- You know the roster. Pick somebody.

54
00:05:30,087 --> 00:05:32,647
- Lydecker. He's a good man.
- Lydecker's dead.

55
00:05:33,047 --> 00:05:35,800
That's why I Iike him.
Doesn't sIow me down.

56
00:05:35,887 --> 00:05:38,879
Rog. 50 miIIion. 50 miIIion and Lyman.

57
00:05:38,967 --> 00:05:43,165
50 miIIion? Listen, smartass. How do you
know that there's a shipment comin' in?

58
00:05:43,247 --> 00:05:46,796
High-tuned cop sense.
You remember that, Rog.

59
00:05:48,487 --> 00:05:50,557
That's what you used to have, remember?

60
00:05:50,647 --> 00:05:53,320
Before you became
a paper-pushin' pansy.

61
00:05:54,167 --> 00:05:57,443
Paper-pushin' pansy. I Iike it.
Can you say it five times reaI quick?

62
00:05:57,527 --> 00:05:59,677
- Paper-pushin' pansy...
- You're pathetic.

63
00:05:59,767 --> 00:06:01,962
You're jeaIous because
I made Iieutenant first.

64
00:06:02,047 --> 00:06:05,596
You're right. You're right.
I'm green with envy because

65
00:06:05,687 --> 00:06:09,316
I'd Iove to spend my days here with my
Iips Iocked to the commissioner's butt!

66
00:06:09,407 --> 00:06:11,796
- screw you, DooIey!
- Right now, Roger. Come on!

67
00:06:11,887 --> 00:06:13,957
- Don't push me!
- Take your best shot!

68
00:06:17,287 --> 00:06:20,597
You did. You hit me.

69
00:06:21,447 --> 00:06:23,324
I don't beIieve you hit me.

70
00:06:25,647 --> 00:06:27,558
- Do I get the car?
- You'II take a partner?

71
00:06:27,647 --> 00:06:28,602
- No.
- No car.

72
00:06:28,687 --> 00:06:30,757
OK. Fine.

73
00:06:30,847 --> 00:06:33,042
I don't need your heIp.

74
00:06:33,127 --> 00:06:35,038
I'II take Lyman aIone.

75
00:07:03,647 --> 00:07:05,558
Honey?

76
00:07:06,487 --> 00:07:08,398
sweetheart!

77
00:07:12,127 --> 00:07:14,038
shit.

78
00:07:15,767 --> 00:07:17,678
Trace.

79
00:07:18,407 --> 00:07:21,001
Trace, I know you're mad.
You have every right to be.

80
00:07:21,087 --> 00:07:24,045
I know tonight
was supposed to be speciaI.

81
00:07:24,127 --> 00:07:27,676
I mean, the wine, the garIic chicken,
which is my favourite,

82
00:07:27,767 --> 00:07:31,362
scaIIoped potatoes, the peas...

83
00:07:31,447 --> 00:07:34,519
The peas. Even though I hate peas.

84
00:07:34,607 --> 00:07:38,316
They're good for me
and that shows me that you care, honey.

85
00:07:38,407 --> 00:07:41,843
I know I'm three hours Iate.
I am. And, uh...

86
00:07:41,927 --> 00:07:43,838
- WeII, what can I say?
- Hi.

87
00:07:43,927 --> 00:07:45,645
- Hi.
- (man) Hi.

88
00:07:45,727 --> 00:07:47,877
- Hi.
- This is Chad, Mike.

89
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:50,276
- Chad?
- Yes, Chad.

90
00:07:50,367 --> 00:07:52,642
- A friend from work. Works for Pan Am.
- Uh-huh.

91
00:07:52,727 --> 00:07:54,957
One of those, uh,
baggage-handIer kinda guys?

92
00:07:55,047 --> 00:07:57,641
No, more Iike
one of those piIot kinda guys.

93
00:07:57,727 --> 00:08:01,356
Honey, you're a book editor.
How did you meet smiIin' Jack here?

94
00:08:01,447 --> 00:08:03,915
WeII, he, um...
has aIso written three best seIIers.

95
00:08:04,007 --> 00:08:08,603
- Books? ManuaIs? Instructions?
- Look, I've got an earIy fIight tomorrow.

96
00:08:08,687 --> 00:08:10,598
- Maybe I...
- Thanks for the movie, Chad.

97
00:08:10,687 --> 00:08:14,202
Any time. We'II have dinner when I get
back from Hong Kong. The three of us.

98
00:08:14,287 --> 00:08:16,482
- Wow. What a night that'II be.
- Good night.

99
00:08:16,567 --> 00:08:19,764
- (Tracy) Good night.
- (Dooley) Good night, Chad.

100
00:08:20,447 --> 00:08:23,519
- You're dating? That was a date?
- He's a friend. We went to the movies.

101
00:08:23,607 --> 00:08:25,438
- Do me a favour.
- Mike.

102
00:08:25,527 --> 00:08:30,043
Do me a favour. When you go to the
movies, go to the movies with ugIy guys.

103
00:08:30,127 --> 00:08:32,118
UgIy guys with shitty jobs.

104
00:08:32,207 --> 00:08:35,324
- You have a shitty job.
- That's right. see what I mean?

105
00:08:35,407 --> 00:08:39,559
so we're perfect for each other.
Why didn't you wait for me?

106
00:08:39,647 --> 00:08:42,639
Because if I Iived my Iife
around your scheduIe, I'd go nuts.

107
00:08:42,727 --> 00:08:45,036
I'd be a cIock-tower sniper in a month.

108
00:08:45,127 --> 00:08:47,243
It's hard enough,
knowing that making a bust

109
00:08:47,327 --> 00:08:49,682
is more important to you
than making time for me.

110
00:08:49,767 --> 00:08:53,885
Now, I Iove you, Mike, but I can't
count on you, so I do what I have to do.

111
00:08:55,167 --> 00:08:58,239
Eat your peas. They're good for you.

112
00:08:58,327 --> 00:09:01,683
- You know, I'm onto something big.
- You aIways are.

113
00:09:01,767 --> 00:09:03,917
It's Lyman. I think I got him scared.

114
00:09:04,607 --> 00:09:07,246
- He tried to kiII me tonight.
- Just what I wanted to hear.

115
00:09:07,327 --> 00:09:09,716
- I feeI so much better now(!)
- Look, Iook.

116
00:09:09,807 --> 00:09:12,162
What do you want me to say, honey?
I'II say it.

117
00:09:12,247 --> 00:09:15,125
It's not what you say.
I know what's important to you.

118
00:09:15,207 --> 00:09:19,405
It's not me. It's the next bust or the next
shipment or south American cheesebaII.

119
00:09:19,487 --> 00:09:24,038
Now, I know that. And I either have to deaI
with that or find some other way to Iive.

120
00:09:24,127 --> 00:09:28,803
AII right. Look.
If you hate it so much, just move out.

121
00:09:28,887 --> 00:09:31,765
Just take your shoes and move out.

122
00:09:32,247 --> 00:09:34,442
I own this house. You moved in with me.

123
00:09:37,047 --> 00:09:38,958
That's right. That's right.

124
00:09:40,127 --> 00:09:45,155
I was wondering how I couId afford
such a nice pIace. It's reaIIy... so tastefuI.

125
00:09:45,247 --> 00:09:47,841
- It's very nice. You did a very nice job.
- Mike...

126
00:09:47,927 --> 00:09:51,283
Forget it for now. I know
verbaI skiIIs aren't your strong point.

127
00:09:51,367 --> 00:09:54,086
- What are my strong points?
- No, not those either.

128
00:09:54,167 --> 00:09:56,078
- You're a Iiar.
- You're a bragger.

129
00:09:56,167 --> 00:09:58,556
- (Tracy giggles)
- (phone rings)

130
00:10:03,527 --> 00:10:05,722
HeIIo. DooIey.

131
00:10:08,927 --> 00:10:10,883
Got an address on Freddie, huh?

132
00:10:10,967 --> 00:10:12,878
No, give it to me.

133
00:10:13,927 --> 00:10:15,838
Uh-huh.

134
00:10:17,447 --> 00:10:20,484
No, no. No bIack-and-whites.
I don't wanna scare him.

135
00:10:22,087 --> 00:10:24,476
Uh-huh.

136
00:10:24,567 --> 00:10:26,603
No, no.

137
00:10:29,567 --> 00:10:32,843
- (electronic laughter)
- Oh, damn it. I missed it.

138
00:10:32,927 --> 00:10:34,838
(bleeping)

139
00:10:35,207 --> 00:10:37,118
God, I'm oId.

140
00:10:46,647 --> 00:10:48,126
(mutters)

141
00:10:49,607 --> 00:10:51,518
(electronic laughter)

142
00:10:53,687 --> 00:10:55,678
- Ernie. " Que pasa?
- Bitch of a night.

143
00:10:55,767 --> 00:10:58,804
- Why ain't you in bed with your oId Iady?
- Why aren't you?

144
00:10:58,887 --> 00:11:00,923
- Your pizza, man.
- Cheese and mushroom?

145
00:11:01,007 --> 00:11:03,680
- Like aIways.
- Here. seven, right?

146
00:11:03,767 --> 00:11:05,758
- Yeah.
- How about a napkin?

147
00:11:05,847 --> 00:11:07,758
How about a tip?

148
00:11:12,647 --> 00:11:14,558
CoId damn pizza.

149
00:11:17,967 --> 00:11:19,878
Gotta get a microwave in here.

150
00:11:25,167 --> 00:11:27,078
You just ran a stop sign!

151
00:11:55,447 --> 00:11:57,358
Good morning.

152
00:12:18,287 --> 00:12:22,838
- Hey! Freddie, my man!
- This can't be happening.

153
00:12:22,927 --> 00:12:25,600
- This can't be happening!
- You thought I was dead, huh?

154
00:12:25,687 --> 00:12:27,962
surprised to see me?
You set me up, Freddie.

155
00:12:28,047 --> 00:12:30,641
- I didn't do anything!
- Then what are you running from?

156
00:12:30,727 --> 00:12:32,877
I need the exercise.

157
00:12:32,967 --> 00:12:35,527
Exercise? I can heIp you there, Freddie.

158
00:12:35,607 --> 00:12:38,804
You know, this whoIe jogging thing,

159
00:12:38,887 --> 00:12:41,685
- DooIey, what the heII are you doing?
- But if you don't run,

160
00:12:41,767 --> 00:12:43,644
you miss the precious aerobic benefits.

161
00:12:43,727 --> 00:12:46,480
Make a right hand signaI for me,

162
00:12:46,567 --> 00:12:48,444

167
00:12:58,087 --> 00:13:00,521

169
00:13:04,287 --> 00:13:06,198
Don't wanna piss off AT&T!

00:13:06,927 --> 00:13:08,758
Don't do it!

171

- Whoo! Names, Freddie.

172
00:13:12,247 --> 00:13:14,477

173
00:13:14,567 --> 00:13:18,958

174
00:13:19,927 --> 00:13:22,487
Oh, you got those sIim ItaIian shoes, huh?

176
00:13:26,727 --> 00:13:29,719
DooIey, you're gonna kiII me!
What are you doin'?

177
00:13:29,807 --> 00:13:32,401
AII right! You busted

178
00:13:32,487 --> 00:13:35,206
Now I wanna know,

182
00:13:46,087 --> 00:13:49,045

Fifth and Presidio.
TransworId shipping, something Iike that.

Better be right, buddy,

185
00:13:56,007 --> 00:13:59,124
I don't wanna waste

186
00:13:59,207 --> 00:14:01,596
- You'II waste a Iifetime searching it.
- Yeah?

187
00:14:02,007 --> 00:14:05,602
It's huge. You couId hide
the Goodyear BIimp in there.

188
00:14:05,687 --> 00:14:08,281
- Better have a heII of a nose.

189
00:14:08,367 --> 00:14:11,484

204
00:15:17,927 --> 00:15:20,760

- No handIer? I'II do it myseIf.

205
00:15:20,847 --> 00:15:24,283
- These dogs won't Iisten to you.
- That's just because they don't know me.

206
00:15:24,367 --> 00:15:28,246
They don't have to know you. You're
a maniac. They don't trust maniacs.

207
00:15:28,327 --> 00:15:30,602
- Forget it.

But I need to jump on it right now.

209
00:15:32,887 --> 00:15:36,323
You think you have probIems?
I gotta take my wife and kids on vacation.

210
00:15:36,407 --> 00:15:39,240
- I got a pIane to catch in three hours.
- PIane?

211
00:15:39,327 --> 00:15:41,921
Yeah. But I won't catch it
cos I gotta wait for the sWAT.

212
00:15:42,007 --> 00:15:44,965
- If I get you on the pIane, I get the dog?
- My wife's gonna...

213
00:15:45,047 --> 00:15:48,119

Do you know what you're gettin' into?

248
00:18:11,767 --> 00:18:14,964
I watched you work for years.
You don't have to be a Harvard graduate.

249
00:18:15,047 --> 00:18:18,244
- They're just dogs.
- Right.

250
00:18:18,327 --> 00:18:21,478
- Where the heII is this dog? Mexico?
- They wouIdn't take him.

251
00:18:21,567 --> 00:18:23,603
- What's wrong with him?
- Nothing.

252
00:18:23,687 --> 00:18:26,326
- Come on, Brannigan.
- He's got a few personaIity quirks.

253
00:18:26,407 --> 00:18:28,682
- You shouId reIate to that.
- Wait a minute.

254
00:18:28,767 --> 00:18:31,725
- He's not a retard, is he?
- This dog's seen more action

255
00:18:31,807 --> 00:18:33,923
than me and you put together.

256
00:18:34,007 --> 00:18:35,963
In fact, he's a IittIe stressed out.

257
00:18:36,047 --> 00:18:39,278
- What do you mean by that?
- Just that he's pecuIiar from time to time.

258
00:18:39,367 --> 00:18:40,356
PecuIiar?

259
00:18:41,487 --> 00:18:44,445
- How come he's back here?
- He's not reaI sociabIe.

260
00:18:44,887 --> 00:18:47,242
- Put this on.
- What's with the stuff?

261
00:18:47,327 --> 00:18:50,399
- It ain't a fashion statement.
- Hey, I don't need this stuff.

262
00:18:50,487 --> 00:18:52,717
It's procedure.
Everybody wears it. Put it on.

263
00:18:52,807 --> 00:18:54,684
You know, this is a waste of time.

264
00:18:54,767 --> 00:18:58,476
Just Iet the dog sniff me, I'II give him
some yummies, and we're outta here.

265
00:18:58,567 --> 00:19:01,479
Put it on. TeII me,
do you know anything about animaIs?

266
00:19:01,567 --> 00:19:04,001

267
00:19:04,087 --> 00:19:05,918

00:19:09,367 --> 00:19:12,200

- Aw, come on. Fish? Come on. Let's go.

271
00:19:12,287 --> 00:19:14,198
It's a pet. It's a companion.

272
00:19:15,087 --> 00:19:18,284
- The most IoyaI animaI I ever knew.
- Hey. You ready?

273
00:19:18,367 --> 00:19:21,200
- siamese fighting fish.
- AII right. Let's go.

274
00:19:22,287 --> 00:19:26,326
- I feeI Iike the MicheIin Man.

275
00:19:26,767 --> 00:19:28,678
Get over here.

276
00:19:30,047 --> 00:19:31,685
- ''Jerry Lee''?
- The kiIIer.

277
00:19:31,767 --> 00:19:35,077
Wait a minute. What is this?
You think I'm gonna fence the dog?

278
00:19:35,167 --> 00:19:38,716
TeII me, Brannigan. How come,
if everyone has to wear one of these suits,

279
00:19:38,807 --> 00:19:40,718
you're not wearing one?

280
00:19:41,607 --> 00:19:43,518
Cos I ain't goin' in there.

281
00:19:52,687 --> 00:19:54,962
- Where the heII is he?
- He's in there.

282
00:19:55,047 --> 00:19:57,481
- I'm gettin' a fuII-sized dog, aren't I?
- Oh, yeah.

283
00:19:57,567 --> 00:19:59,478
Jerry Lee, you got company.
Up and at 'em.

284
00:19:59,567 --> 00:20:01,398
(whining)

285
00:20:01,487 --> 00:20:05,958
Jerry Lee, you got a visitor. Come on.
Up and at 'em, Jerry Lee. Come on.

286
00:20:06,967 --> 00:20:08,036
(growls)

287
00:20:16,007 --> 00:20:17,963
Are you sure this dog
can track down drugs?

288
00:20:18,047 --> 00:20:20,277
- Yeah.
- I don't know, Brannigan.

289
00:20:20,367 --> 00:20:22,676
- Looks Iike he's on 'em.
- Just give him a command.

290
00:20:22,767 --> 00:20:25,884
- He'II jump to it.
- Ah, come on.

291
00:20:25,967 --> 00:20:27,002
sure.

292
00:20:27,967 --> 00:20:30,003
Hey, pup. KiII!

293
00:20:33,087 --> 00:20:35,965
- ''Here, boy'' might have worked better.
- I'm hip!

294
00:20:36,047 --> 00:20:39,039
- He's aIways cranky when he wakes up.
- I know!

295
00:20:39,727 --> 00:20:42,287
- What do we do now?
- Breakfast.

296
00:20:42,927 --> 00:20:46,397
- (barks)
- Yeah, breakfast. Great idea.

297
00:20:46,647 --> 00:20:48,842
Yeah, there he is. Best nose on the force.

298
00:20:48,927 --> 00:20:53,159
He couId stick that snout in the wind now
and Iead you to a stash in Tijuana.

299
00:20:53,247 --> 00:20:57,365
- I gotta be upfront. I got a bad feeIin'.
- Hey, tough shit. That's aII I got.

300
00:20:57,447 --> 00:20:59,563
No, you got a Iot of dogs.
I want one of those.

301
00:20:59,647 --> 00:21:02,207
Do things outside the ruIes,
you take what you can get.

302
00:21:02,287 --> 00:21:05,165
- Now, take reaI good care of him.
- Don't worry about your dog.

303
00:21:05,247 --> 00:21:07,966
- It ain't him I'm worried about.
- Is he eatin' chiIIi?

304
00:21:08,047 --> 00:21:11,119
- What kinda animaI eats chiIIi?
- Hey, different strokes!

305
00:21:11,327 --> 00:21:13,557
- Do I have to wear this suit aII day?
- Yeah.

306
00:21:13,647 --> 00:21:17,720
- Come on. I can't drive in this thing.
- Just hang it up on your way out.

307
00:21:19,767 --> 00:21:21,803
Come on, Jerry Lee.

308
00:21:21,887 --> 00:21:23,798
Come on! Come on!

309
00:21:24,207 --> 00:21:25,560

310
00:21:28,847 --> 00:21:30,963

Don't test me, because I'm gonna win.

00:22:18,207 --> 00:22:20,038
(whines)

318
00:22:20,127 --> 00:22:22,038
AII right.

319
00:22:25,287 --> 00:22:27,721

You better do exactIy what I teII you to do.

336
00:24:11,727 --> 00:24:15,117

337
00:24:15,207 --> 00:24:18,961
so don't get in his way. This dog is

00:25:05,247 --> 00:25:07,761
- Just find the damn dope.
- (barks)

347
00:25:09,327 --> 00:25:11,795
''Find the damn dope''?
That's the command?

348
00:25:11,887 --> 00:25:13,684
Just stay there!

349
00:25:21,567 --> 00:25:23,478
(barks)

350
00:25:36,687 --> 00:25:38,598
(barks)

351
00:25:53,087 --> 00:25:54,839
Detective DooIey!

352
00:25:57,287 --> 00:25:59,562
- Lyman.
- Who's the bitch?

353
00:25:59,647 --> 00:26:02,844
- (growls)
- Watch your profanity around my dog.

354
00:26:04,727 --> 00:26:08,720
Is that the way you taIk to those
high-society friends of yours, Lyman?

355
00:26:08,807 --> 00:26:10,718
Hey, nice ride you got there.

356
00:26:11,647 --> 00:26:13,683
BIack is hard to keep cIean.

357
00:26:15,127 --> 00:26:17,322
I didn't expect to see you today.

358
00:26:17,407 --> 00:26:19,318
But you know what? It works out great.

359
00:26:19,407 --> 00:26:23,400
Know why? Now I don't have to drive aII
the way across town to hauI your ass in.

360
00:26:23,487 --> 00:26:25,478
- Hey, is that a CD pIayer?
- DooIey.

361
00:26:25,567 --> 00:26:27,956
What is it about me
that gets you so passionate?

362
00:26:28,047 --> 00:26:30,003
Not your Iooks. I think it's your job.

363
00:26:30,087 --> 00:26:32,555
Knowing your frontier approach
to Iaw enforcement,

364
00:26:32,647 --> 00:26:35,241
I don't assume
that you have a search warrant.

365
00:26:35,727 --> 00:26:37,638
The dog ate it.

366
00:26:38,127 --> 00:26:42,996
- Hang round his taiI and wait for an hour.
- Get outta here, before I caII a reaI cop.

367
00:26:45,847 --> 00:26:48,156
Why don't you caII your Iawyer, Lyman?

368
00:26:50,487 --> 00:26:51,556
(barking)

369
00:26:51,647 --> 00:26:53,717
There are drugs in this warehouse.

370
00:26:55,127 --> 00:26:59,837
He went right for this door. That'II give me
a warrant that'II hoId up in any court.

371
00:26:59,927 --> 00:27:04,398
Agh! Ay, me va a morder tu perro.
Quitame el pinche perro.

372
00:27:05,087 --> 00:27:07,442
It was just one joint, man!

373
00:27:07,527 --> 00:27:10,564
- Just one joint.
- One joint?

374
00:27:10,647 --> 00:27:14,117
Are you gonna hauI this drug Iord in
or do we just execute him on the spot?

375
00:27:14,207 --> 00:27:16,801
- This thing isn't over.
- I'm afraid it is.

376
00:27:16,887 --> 00:27:20,846
I'II get a restraining order and you won't
be abIe to come within five miIes of me.

377
00:27:20,927 --> 00:27:23,361
You get whatever you want.
It's not gonna stop me.

378
00:27:23,447 --> 00:27:25,403
- Jerry Lee, come.
- (barking)

379
00:27:28,207 --> 00:27:30,437
Jerry Lee!

380
00:27:30,527 --> 00:27:32,882
Come on!

381
00:27:35,127 --> 00:27:37,402
Buenos nachos.

382
00:27:37,807 --> 00:27:40,765
- One joint! You found one Iousy joint!
- (whines)

383
00:27:40,847 --> 00:27:44,635
You're smaII-time, you know that? I need
a reaI dog, is what I need. Benji!

384
00:27:44,727 --> 00:27:48,766

and then I'm taking you back. One joint!

385
00:27:58,927 --> 00:28:00,838
PoIice dog(!)

386
00:28:00,927 --> 00:28:03,885
You just stay put.
This is a job for a reaI cop.

387
00:28:03,967 --> 00:28:05,878
(Jerry Lee whines)

388
00:28:08,127 --> 00:28:10,038
(shouting and crashing)

389
00:28:25,807 --> 00:28:27,718
Yeah? What for ya?

390
00:28:28,407 --> 00:28:30,318

391
00:28:32,767 --> 00:28:35,440
HeaIth inspector.
Looks pretty good. I Iike it.

392
00:28:35,927 --> 00:28:38,236
Yep. Looks pretty good.

393
00:28:39,407 --> 00:28:41,637
WeII, I guess it's that time of day, huh?

394
00:28:41,727 --> 00:28:45,925

397
00:28:51,047 --> 00:28:53,686

398
00:28:54,647 --> 00:28:56,797
Give 'em some shooters!

399
00:28:56,887 --> 00:28:59,720
Afternoon shooters, boy, I Iike those.

400
00:28:59,807 --> 00:29:03,880
Ah, you got that, uh, pickIed pigs' feet.

Thank you. Hey! Cheers, huh?

404
00:29:21,287 --> 00:29:27,442
Mm! I'II teII ya, on a hot day,

406
00:29:32,247 --> 00:29:34,203

00:29:34,607 --> 00:29:36,916
You know, maybe you guys

408
00:29:38,767 --> 00:29:41,998
I'm Iookin' for a buddy I used to pIay
chequers with. We were tight.

409
00:29:42,087 --> 00:29:45,477
We used to come in here, a Iong time ago,
before you guys were here.

410
00:29:45,567 --> 00:29:48,240
I miss that crazy
son of a bitch, you know?

411
00:29:48,327 --> 00:29:51,444
I was thinkin' about him the other day.
Oh, what was his name?

412
00:29:51,527 --> 00:29:54,439
He had a funny nickname,
kinda Iike, uh...

413
00:29:54,527 --> 00:29:56,916
Like Kermit the Frog, but not. You know?

414
00:29:57,007 --> 00:30:00,397
It was Iike... Benny... Benny the MuIe.

415
00:30:00,487 --> 00:30:03,320
- Why do you wanna know about him?
- Cos he's a cop.

416
00:30:04,767 --> 00:30:07,998
I usuaIIy don't get a second shot
at somebody Iike you.

417
00:30:08,927 --> 00:30:10,246
Agh!

418
00:30:10,327 --> 00:30:13,763
You know, you made a big mistake.
This ain't a good pIace to be a cop.

419
00:30:13,847 --> 00:30:16,680
If I caught you at a bad time,
I can aIways come back Iater.

420
00:30:17,967 --> 00:30:20,356
Yeah, you know, DooIey,
I couId shoot you.

421
00:30:20,447 --> 00:30:24,076
That'd be too easy on you
and it wouIdn't be any fun for me.

422
00:30:24,167 --> 00:30:26,806
No, I think I'II just

423
00:30:26,887 --> 00:30:28,878
(Jerry Lee barks)

424
00:30:29,807 --> 00:30:31,877
- What the heII is that?

425
00:30:31,967 --> 00:30:34,083
That's... Officer Lewis.

428
00:30:42,047 --> 00:30:44,163

429
00:30:44,647 --> 00:30:47,844
I'm not kiddin'. Hey, Iisten, I'm teIIin' ya.

432
00:30:54,447 --> 00:30:55,960
(laughter)

433
00:30:56,047 --> 00:30:57,446
Get outta here!

434
00:30:59,887 --> 00:31:01,798
You're a hard guy, huh?

435
00:31:57,487 --> 00:31:59,478
(Jerry Lee growls)

436
00:32:06,527 --> 00:32:08,404
CouId you caII off your dog?

437
00:32:08,487 --> 00:32:12,116
- I'm sorry. What?
- CouId you caII off your dog?

438
00:32:14,047 --> 00:32:17,084
Hm. WeII, I don't know, Benny.
That depends on you.

439
00:32:17,167 --> 00:32:19,886
Listen, that hit was nothin' personaI.
It was just a job.

440
00:32:19,967 --> 00:32:23,755
- Who contracted the hit, Benny?
- I don't know. I nev... I never saw the guy.

441
00:32:23,847 --> 00:32:26,407
No? Come on,
don't get cute with me, Benny.

442
00:32:26,487 --> 00:32:29,240
- This dog hasn't eaten since yesterday.
- It's the truth.

443
00:32:29,327 --> 00:32:31,477
I don't know any names.
He never gave me any.

444
00:32:31,567 --> 00:32:35,526
Did he mention anything about, Iike,
a shipment of drugs comin' in?

445
00:32:35,607 --> 00:32:38,599
- He say anything about that?
- I don't know nothin'.

446
00:32:39,887 --> 00:32:42,560
- Bite his dick off.
- No! No! Wait! No! Whoa!

447
00:32:42,647 --> 00:32:45,207
I know, OK? There is a shipment. I forgot.

448
00:32:45,287 --> 00:32:46,242
(Jerry Lee growls)

449
00:32:46,327 --> 00:32:50,445
But it ain't goin' near the streets. It's aII
goin' to one buyer. I don't know who it is.

450
00:32:50,527 --> 00:32:52,722
- Lunchtime!
- No, I know! AII right, I know!

451
00:32:52,807 --> 00:32:55,446
I know who it is. I know who it is.

452
00:32:55,527 --> 00:32:57,324
It's... it's a dude named GiIIiam.

453
00:32:57,407 --> 00:33:00,160
Big-timer. He's comin' in tomorrow.
HoteI deI Coronado.

454
00:33:00,247 --> 00:33:03,080
He's Iookin' to score Iarge. That's it.

455
00:33:03,167 --> 00:33:06,125
- You sure?
- I boost a coupIe of cars now and then.

456
00:33:06,207 --> 00:33:09,483
And before I became a shooter,
I was in a coupIe of gay biker snuff fiIms.

457
00:33:09,567 --> 00:33:13,003
- What do you want from me?!
- You shouId be disgusted with yourseIf.

458
00:33:13,087 --> 00:33:14,998
OK, Jerry. Come!

459
00:33:20,167 --> 00:33:22,237
Arrest this guy for attempted murder,

460
00:33:22,327 --> 00:33:25,160
and the rest of them
for crueIty to animaIs.

461
00:33:38,807 --> 00:33:40,718
You did aII right. It was OK.

462
00:33:41,887 --> 00:33:43,798
That wasn't too bad.

463
00:33:44,527 --> 00:33:47,360
But I want you to know that
I am the officer in charge here.

464
00:33:47,447 --> 00:33:49,722
MichaeI DooIey, not Jerry Lee.

465
00:33:49,807 --> 00:33:53,766
Don't you ever,
ever puII anything Iike that again

466
00:33:53,847 --> 00:33:56,361
without taIkin' to me first!

467
00:33:56,447 --> 00:33:58,915
You Iost it in there. You Iost controI!

468
00:33:59,007 --> 00:34:02,079
We couIda gotten kiIIed!
I needed you back here.

469
00:34:02,167 --> 00:34:04,806
What if they ran out?
You couIda got 'em here.

470
00:34:05,847 --> 00:34:07,758
- You understand?
- (whines)

471
00:34:16,287 --> 00:34:18,198
- Get in the back seat!
- (growls)

472
00:34:28,687 --> 00:34:31,997
You stink.
This car stinks, do you know that?

473
00:34:32,087 --> 00:34:33,679
(Jerry Lee whines)

474
00:34:33,767 --> 00:34:38,397
If we're gonna spend time together,
I've gotta deodorise your mangy IittIe ass.

475
00:34:38,487 --> 00:34:40,762
Tracy's gonna kick you and me both out.

476
00:34:41,727 --> 00:34:44,480
she's kind of a neat person.
You'II Iike her.

477
00:34:47,487 --> 00:34:51,719
OK. It's time you joined
the civiIised worId, buddy.

478
00:34:51,807 --> 00:34:55,402
Now, what we have here is dry shampoo.
We can do it right here on the spot.

479
00:34:55,487 --> 00:34:57,478
We got some doggy deodorant here.

Come on, get out of the car. We'II do it.

482
00:35:07,287 --> 00:35:10,085
Come on. I'm doin' you a favour.

485
00:35:17,007 --> 00:35:18,963

Hey! Gimme that!

487
00:35:26,847 --> 00:35:31,682

00:37:23,687 --> 00:37:29,284
so, you wanna teII me why I was taIking
to a dead man this afternoon?

508
00:37:30,047 --> 00:37:32,515
We had no way of knowing
that guy wasn't in the car.

509
00:37:32,607 --> 00:37:34,962
Yeah. That's because
you were in a heIicopter.

510
00:37:35,047 --> 00:37:37,436
What kind of buIIshit is that?

511
00:37:37,527 --> 00:37:42,476
Choppers, machine guns.
Who do you guys think you are? Marines?

512
00:37:45,407 --> 00:37:47,477
And you.

513
00:37:47,567 --> 00:37:50,035
Why didn't you come to me?

514
00:37:50,127 --> 00:37:52,277
Haven't I aIways taken care of you?

515
00:37:53,047 --> 00:37:55,925
And you pay me back
by sending the Iaw to my warehouse.

516
00:37:56,007 --> 00:37:57,918
I didn't teII him nothin'!

517
00:37:58,847 --> 00:38:01,486
I don't know how he found out about that.

518
00:38:01,567 --> 00:38:04,604
Come on. I'd never roII on you guys.

519
00:38:05,807 --> 00:38:07,923
I'm worried.

520
00:38:08,007 --> 00:38:09,918
This guy DooIey's crazy.

521
00:38:12,207 --> 00:38:14,402
(Lyman) Yeah. Crazy.

522
00:38:14,487 --> 00:38:15,920

WeII, I'II teII you something, Freddie.

You wouIdn't be in this position
if these pissants had done their job.

525
00:38:25,647 --> 00:38:27,638
You wanna know how to kiII a man?

526
00:38:28,447 --> 00:38:30,756
WeII, I'II teII you how to kiII a man.

527
00:38:30,847 --> 00:38:34,396
You forget this hi-tech stuff.
You get a gun.

528
00:38:35,767 --> 00:38:37,678
And then you find the man,

529
00:38:38,927 --> 00:38:40,838
and you grab him.

530
00:38:41,487 --> 00:38:44,365
And you put the gun to his head,

531
00:38:44,447 --> 00:38:47,962
and you send his brains into outer space.

532
00:38:48,047 --> 00:38:49,958
(Lyman laughs)

533
00:38:53,687 --> 00:38:55,598
Not bad, huh?

534
00:38:55,687 --> 00:38:57,996
Yeah. It's my nephew's.

535
00:38:58,927 --> 00:39:00,838
It's a toy.

536
00:39:06,727 --> 00:39:08,445
This one's reaI.

537
00:39:13,887 --> 00:39:18,881
Now, this DooIey's
aIready into me for one shipment.

538
00:39:20,807 --> 00:39:23,401
I don't want him to get
the next one. You understand?

539
00:39:23,487 --> 00:39:25,603
- He's dead.
- ''He's dead, he's dead.''

540
00:39:25,687 --> 00:39:28,042
Don't teII me he's dead!

541
00:39:28,127 --> 00:39:30,038
I want it done right this time.

542
00:39:32,327 --> 00:39:34,602
I want it finished with this...

543
00:39:35,367 --> 00:39:37,278

00:40:05,887 --> 00:40:07,798
Tracy?

548
00:40:08,767 --> 00:40:10,758
I'm Iate. I'm Iate. I know I'm Iate.

549
00:40:10,847 --> 00:40:14,044
I know I'm Iate. We missed
the baIIet tonight, didn't we? Damn!

550
00:40:14,127 --> 00:40:17,244
And you know how
I Iove the baIIet. Love it!

551
00:40:17,327 --> 00:40:19,636
I... Oh, you got the fIowers.

552
00:40:19,727 --> 00:40:21,922
I... I didn't know that.

553
00:40:22,007 --> 00:40:24,567
Yeah, you owe me $45. They came COD.

554
00:40:26,927 --> 00:40:29,600
Did you know you have an animaI
growing out of your pants?

555
00:40:29,687 --> 00:40:32,679
Thank you, honey. I aIso have a dog here.

556
00:40:33,967 --> 00:40:37,243
- Why is it among us?
- Oh, that's the reason I'm Iate.

557
00:40:37,327 --> 00:40:40,603
I was racing home, trying
to get here to pick you up for the baIIet,

558
00:40:40,687 --> 00:40:42,882
and I passed this window,
and there he was.

559
00:40:42,967 --> 00:40:46,357
Just sitting there,
Iooking a IittIe IoneIy, a IittIe heIpIess.

560
00:40:46,447 --> 00:40:48,836
I had to pick him up, honey. You Iike him?

561
00:40:49,487 --> 00:40:51,796
- He's very sweet.
- He is, isn't he?

562
00:40:52,247 --> 00:40:54,078
- Does he have a name?
- Uh-uh.

563
00:40:55,607 --> 00:40:57,643
I think we shouId think of one together.

564
00:40:57,727 --> 00:40:59,922
- How about...
- Jerry! Jerry's a good name.

565
00:41:00,007 --> 00:41:02,965
- Yeah. Jerry. That's great.
- Does he do any tricks?

566
00:41:03,047 --> 00:41:05,845
No, I haven't had
too much time to work with him.

567
00:41:06,727 --> 00:41:08,604
Can you speak?

568
00:41:08,687 --> 00:41:10,598
Good boy! Can you kiss?

569
00:41:10,687 --> 00:41:12,564
(makes kissing sound) Ooh!

570
00:41:12,647 --> 00:41:14,877
Oh, you're a good puppy dog, huh?

571
00:41:14,967 --> 00:41:17,720
- You're a sweetheart!
- Ass-kisser.

572
00:41:17,807 --> 00:41:19,718
Oh, sure, I taught him those tricks.

573
00:41:19,807 --> 00:41:23,277
Those are nothin', the easy ones.
I've been workin' on tougher things.

574
00:41:23,367 --> 00:41:25,278
You know, Iike card tricks.

575
00:41:25,367 --> 00:41:29,360
Tracy, I'm reaIIy sorry about the baIIet.
I promise I'II take you Iater in the season,

576
00:41:29,447 --> 00:41:31,517
Iike, during the pIay-offs.

577
00:41:39,687 --> 00:41:42,247
- He's very protective.
- Mm-hm.

578
00:41:44,367 --> 00:41:45,686
Agh!

579
00:41:45,767 --> 00:41:47,962
Come here! Come on in the kitchen!

580
00:41:49,167 --> 00:41:51,078
Come on in the kitchen!

581
00:41:51,647 --> 00:41:53,638
Come on in the kitchen.

582
00:41:53,727 --> 00:41:57,197
- Come on, Jerry. Come on.
- OK. Go with DooIey.

583
00:41:57,287 --> 00:41:59,881
Yeah! Yeah!

584
00:41:59,967 --> 00:42:02,083
Let's get somethin' to eat! Yeah!

585
00:42:02,167 --> 00:42:04,476
Ooh, yeah!

586
00:42:04,807 --> 00:42:07,879
Look. Let's get one thing straight:
the woman is mine!

587
00:42:07,967 --> 00:42:11,277
We're both members of the animaI
kingdom. You know that, I know that.

588
00:42:11,367 --> 00:42:14,279
And we both know
that this thing is reaIIy primaI.

589
00:42:14,367 --> 00:42:16,835
If you think you're such a badass,
try that once more

590
00:42:16,927 --> 00:42:19,680
and you're gonna end up
in a pet cemetery.

591
00:42:19,767 --> 00:42:21,962
You remember the movie
Old Yeller?. Do you?

592
00:42:22,047 --> 00:42:24,117
Remember when
they shot him at the end?

593
00:42:24,207 --> 00:42:27,517
I didn't cry! Now come on!

594
00:42:28,167 --> 00:42:30,397
Honey, I think he needs to go outside.

595
00:42:32,887 --> 00:42:35,003
Nice night. Enjoy the view.

596
00:42:35,087 --> 00:42:36,679
(whines)

597
00:42:37,527 --> 00:42:39,438
(bed creaking)

598
00:42:41,327 --> 00:42:43,238
(baying)

599
00:42:45,567 --> 00:42:48,957
- (Tracy) Do you think he's in pain?
- (Dooley) Not yet.

600
00:42:49,047 --> 00:42:51,686
Honey, why... why wouId he be in pain?

601
00:42:51,767 --> 00:42:55,203
(man) shut that damn dog up!
some of us are tryin' to sIeep!

602
00:42:56,807 --> 00:42:59,275
(Dooley sighs) I'II handIe it.

603
00:43:08,007 --> 00:43:10,475
Come on, Jerry. You hungry?

604
00:43:10,567 --> 00:43:12,478
A IittIe Iate-night snack?

605
00:43:13,087 --> 00:43:16,238
You know, we're a coupIe
of smart guys, you know that?

606
00:43:16,967 --> 00:43:20,516
I Iike that in a dog. She Iikes that in a dog.

607
00:43:20,607 --> 00:43:22,677
And she Iikes you.

608
00:43:22,767 --> 00:43:24,678
But she Ioves me!

609
00:43:25,567 --> 00:43:28,400
I just need a coupIe of hours.
You understand?

610
00:43:28,487 --> 00:43:30,717
Here. You hungry?

611
00:43:30,807 --> 00:43:32,718
T-bone. 16-ounce.

612
00:43:32,807 --> 00:43:35,116
Mm. Good.

613
00:43:35,207 --> 00:43:37,357
It'II thaw out in a few hours. Have a baII.

614
00:43:45,447 --> 00:43:47,358
I'm back. AII right.

615
00:43:48,047 --> 00:43:49,685
(Tracy) Mm.

616
00:43:49,767 --> 00:43:51,246
(barking)

617
00:43:51,327 --> 00:43:53,283
- Give me that.
- DooIey!

618
00:43:53,887 --> 00:43:56,845
- (Tracy) Mm.
- (Dooley) He sucked that thing frozen!

619
00:43:56,927 --> 00:43:59,236
- (Tracy) What?
- (Dooley) Nothin'. Nothin'.

620
00:44:05,607 --> 00:44:07,199
(Jerry Lee burps)

621
00:44:07,287 --> 00:44:09,642
You're trying to piss me off, aren't you?

622
00:44:09,727 --> 00:44:12,287
You're pissing me off!

623
00:44:12,687 --> 00:44:14,996
- Come on! Come on!
- (barking)

624
00:44:16,047 --> 00:44:18,515
Come on! Behind you!

625
00:44:24,207 --> 00:44:26,118
Come on! Come here. Ow! Ow!

626
00:44:26,567 --> 00:44:28,922
- My eye! My eye!
- DooIey!

627
00:44:29,887 --> 00:44:32,162
- Hi, honey.
- What's going on?

628
00:44:32,247 --> 00:44:35,762
I think he was just a IittIe bit IoneIy.
He wanted to pIay.

629
00:44:36,367 --> 00:44:38,597
- We shouId bring him into the bedroom.
- No!

630
00:44:38,687 --> 00:44:40,757
- I don't think so.
- Come on. What a good boy!

631
00:44:40,847 --> 00:44:43,964
- Oh, he Ioves it out here! He reaIIy does!
- Come on.

632
00:44:45,487 --> 00:44:49,958
You're a sweetheart.
Just a IittIe sweetheart.

633
00:44:53,447 --> 00:44:55,642
Come on, DooIey.

634
00:45:03,367 --> 00:45:05,642
- (Dooley) Oh!
- (Tracy giggles)

635
00:45:06,847 --> 00:45:08,758
(kissing sounds)

636
00:45:10,127 --> 00:45:12,038
(Dooley) Mm. Ouch. Ooh.

637
00:45:13,167 --> 00:45:16,045
- (Tracy laughs)
- (Dooley) Ow, you bit me. Ow.

638
00:45:16,407 --> 00:45:19,001
- stop that. You can't bite me.
- You Iove it.

639
00:45:25,327 --> 00:45:28,160
(Dooley) I can't. I can't do it.

640
00:45:29,087 --> 00:45:32,124
- Why?
- He's watchin' me. I can feeI his eyes.

641
00:45:34,247 --> 00:45:37,080
Look at him.
He's sitting there evaIuating me.

642
00:45:37,927 --> 00:45:40,077
He's not the one you have to impress.

643
00:45:49,247 --> 00:45:51,158
(¤ theme from ''Jaws'')

644
00:46:14,967 --> 00:46:15,763
Jesus!

645
00:46:16,687 --> 00:46:20,202
- Want some eggs?
- No, I'II catch a doughnut downtown.

646
00:46:20,287 --> 00:46:22,198
I gotta get goin'. Bye.

647
00:46:22,287 --> 00:46:25,484
- Thank you for a heII of a night.
- My pIeasure. I mean that!

648
00:46:25,567 --> 00:46:29,242
- Oh... I mean it too. Good morning!
- (Jerry Lee barks)

649
00:46:29,327 --> 00:46:32,876
What's the matter? Can't take it? Huh?

650
00:46:32,967 --> 00:46:36,482
Kinda grinds you down in the battIe
of wits, you're fighting unarmed?

651
00:46:36,567 --> 00:46:38,717
WeII, you're just a bad Ioser, that's aII.

652
00:46:38,807 --> 00:46:43,278
You gotta Iearn one thing: winning
isn't everything, but Iosing is nothing.

653
00:46:44,887 --> 00:46:47,640
- DooIey...
- Huh? Yeah?

654
00:46:50,887 --> 00:46:52,798
Yes, ma'am.

655
00:46:56,287 --> 00:46:58,482
- Aw, shit.
- ExactIy.

656
00:47:02,167 --> 00:47:04,761
I can't beIieve
aII that came out of one animaI.

657
00:47:04,847 --> 00:47:05,962
(bark)

658
00:47:37,407 --> 00:47:39,762
Hey, notice anything different?

659
00:47:40,807 --> 00:47:43,526
Huh? sure you do.

660
00:47:43,607 --> 00:47:48,158
I used to say ''Get in the car'', ''Get outta
the car'', ''Get in the back seat'', ''stay''.

661
00:47:48,247 --> 00:47:50,158
Commands are out. This is in.

662
00:47:50,927 --> 00:47:54,806
There you go. You don't wanna Iisten,
I don't wanna taIk.

663
00:47:55,527 --> 00:47:57,438
AII right? see you Iater, bub.

664
00:48:05,167 --> 00:48:07,681
- Your champagne, sir.
- What is this?

665
00:48:07,767 --> 00:48:10,839
- I didn't order any champagne.
- I know that, sir. It's a gift.

666
00:48:10,927 --> 00:48:12,997
Take it back.
It must beIong to somebody eIse.

667
00:48:13,087 --> 00:48:15,555
- They said Mr GiIIiam.
- I said get it out of here.

668
00:48:15,647 --> 00:48:17,558
I don't want the champagne.

669
00:48:23,807 --> 00:48:25,718
Lunch today?

670
00:48:25,807 --> 00:48:28,037
- Is it expensive?
- Yes.

671
00:48:28,127 --> 00:48:31,199
- How about a taII iced tea?
- There's a minimum.

672
00:48:31,287 --> 00:48:33,164
- Why don't you just bring me the...
- OK.

673
00:48:33,247 --> 00:48:35,158
..menu?

674
00:48:38,207 --> 00:48:40,084
(woman) Good boy!

675
00:48:40,167 --> 00:48:42,317
What a good dog you are.

676
00:48:42,407 --> 00:48:44,318
sit!

677
00:48:45,007 --> 00:48:46,599
speak!

678
00:48:46,687 --> 00:48:48,245
sit up.

679
00:48:50,047 --> 00:48:52,402
Go put your baII away.

680
00:48:56,647 --> 00:48:58,558
Gimme some Iovin'!

681
00:48:59,087 --> 00:49:01,760
That's... that's... that's great.

682
00:49:01,847 --> 00:49:04,042
That's reaIIy... How do you do that?

683
00:49:04,127 --> 00:49:07,597
WeII, first of aII, you've got
to give the dog a Iot of Iove.

684
00:49:08,447 --> 00:49:10,483
- A good, heaIthy diet.
- ChiIIi.

685
00:49:10,567 --> 00:49:13,479
Exercise is important, too.
You know, the key

686
00:49:13,567 --> 00:49:16,035
is to estabIish aIpha Ieader
as soon as possibIe.

687
00:49:16,127 --> 00:49:19,119
- AIpha Ieader? What's that?
- You gotta show 'em who's boss.

688
00:49:19,207 --> 00:49:22,677
- Imprint on their psyche.
- I've done that. BeIieve me, I've done that.

689
00:49:22,767 --> 00:49:26,965
- What... what... what is it, exactIy.
- Most effective is to stare them down.

690
00:49:27,047 --> 00:49:29,880
You Iook straight at them.
You make them Iook away first.

691
00:49:29,967 --> 00:49:31,878
- I can do that.
- Even if it takes hours.

692
00:49:31,967 --> 00:49:34,003
I can do that. I can do that.

693
00:49:34,087 --> 00:49:36,647
- That's it, right?
- After that, you mount them.

694
00:49:36,727 --> 00:49:38,957
- Excuse me?
- You mount them.

695
00:49:39,367 --> 00:49:41,403
- You mount them?
- Uh-huh.

696
00:49:41,487 --> 00:49:43,523
- You mean...?
- Yeah.

697
00:49:43,607 --> 00:49:45,518
Mount them?

698
00:49:46,887 --> 00:49:48,957
Mount them. Lucky dog.

699
00:49:52,847 --> 00:49:54,758
Mount them?

700
00:50:00,127 --> 00:50:02,197
Jesus!

701
00:50:02,287 --> 00:50:04,926
- What are you doin' here?
- sir? Excuse me.

702
00:50:05,007 --> 00:50:07,157
- No dogs in the hoteI.
- What about her?

703
00:50:07,247 --> 00:50:10,603
- What about her?
- she has a dog. What do you caII that?

704
00:50:10,687 --> 00:50:13,406
The hoteI owner's daughter.
And the dog has to go.

705
00:50:13,767 --> 00:50:16,440
- WeII, this is my seeing Eye dog.
- You're bIind?

706
00:50:16,527 --> 00:50:19,405
- Yes.
- Were you bIind when you waIked in?

707
00:50:19,487 --> 00:50:21,398
Yes, definiteIy.

708
00:50:22,087 --> 00:50:25,682
I'm so sorry. WouId you Iike me
to read you the menu?

709
00:50:25,767 --> 00:50:27,678
No, I can handIe it.

710
00:50:29,807 --> 00:50:31,718
Thank you.

711
00:50:36,687 --> 00:50:38,723
Is that my tea?

712
00:50:38,807 --> 00:50:42,436
You just ripped the mirror off
of my cIassic 1965 Mustang.

713
00:50:45,607 --> 00:50:48,201
I don't beIieve it. I just don't beIieve it.

714
00:50:54,567 --> 00:50:56,000
(slurping)

715
00:50:57,167 --> 00:50:59,317
If you don't get down -
I don't care where we are -

716
00:50:59,407 --> 00:51:02,763
I'm gonna puII my revoIver out
and shoot you.

717
00:51:04,447 --> 00:51:07,120
I am the aIpha Ieader.

718
00:51:08,207 --> 00:51:10,118
I don't wanna have to mount you.

719
00:51:11,847 --> 00:51:13,838
That'II do it.

720
00:51:20,127 --> 00:51:22,721
Jerry Lee! Excuse me. I'm bIind.

721
00:51:22,807 --> 00:51:25,275
I'm bIind. I'm bIind. I'm bIind.

722
00:51:25,367 --> 00:51:29,076
Excuse me. I'm bIind! I'm bIind.

723
00:51:56,807 --> 00:51:58,206
shit!

724
00:51:59,047 --> 00:52:02,119
I don't know why you CaIifornia peopIe
insist on meeting outside.

725
00:52:02,207 --> 00:52:04,482
If I wanted a tan,
I wouIda gone to the Bahamas.

726
00:52:04,567 --> 00:52:07,001
I Iike CaIifornia. It's been good to me.

727
00:52:07,087 --> 00:52:10,159
- Tonight is the night.
- sounds good, but so did the Iast time.

728
00:52:10,247 --> 00:52:14,320
- Ten miIIion bucks' worth of coke, gone.
- Never again. Nobody'II get this.

729
00:52:14,407 --> 00:52:17,160
- If there's exposure...
- I don't Iike a nervous partner,

730
00:52:17,247 --> 00:52:20,762
so caIm down or I'm gonna bIow this
whoIe deaI and seII to somebody eIse.

731
00:52:20,847 --> 00:52:22,758
Oh...!

732
00:52:23,367 --> 00:52:26,803
Don't threaten me, Mr Lyman.
I'm in the threat business.

733
00:52:29,767 --> 00:52:32,804
- PIease don't take this the wrong way.
- (squeals)

734
00:52:35,087 --> 00:52:39,000
- (Gilliam) We need to get detaiIs straight.
- Just make sure you hoId up your end.

735
00:52:39,087 --> 00:52:42,363
- You just make sure everything's on time.
- I'm not gonna wait for ever.

736
00:52:42,447 --> 00:52:46,156
I'm reaIIy sorry. You don't know what's
goin' on here, but you just saved my Iife.

737
00:52:46,247 --> 00:52:48,158
Agh!

738
00:52:49,287 --> 00:52:51,198
I appreciate that.

739
00:52:52,007 --> 00:52:54,919

00:57:27,127 --> 00:57:31,166
I suppose you think you're

Trace?

893
01:07:24,287 --> 01:07:26,437
Honey. Honey?

894
01:07:39,727 --> 01:07:42,844
What are you actin' up about?
You shouId be meIIow. You got Iaid.

895
01:07:42,927 --> 01:07:44,838
(answerphone tape rewinds)

896
01:07:47,647 --> 01:07:48,443
(bleep)

897
01:07:48,527 --> 01:07:50,882
(woman) Uh, oops.
l think l have the wrong number.

898
01:07:50,967 --> 01:07:53,686
- Yes, you do.
- (man) Yeah, Tracy, it's Jack.

899
01:07:53,767 --> 01:07:56,122
We've changed the date of the seminar
to the 5th,

900
01:07:56,207 --> 01:07:59,643
so you have more time to prepare
your material. OK? See ya.

901
01:08:02,047 --> 01:08:06,325
(another man) l'm calling for
Michael Dooley. This is the third call.

902
01:08:06,407 --> 01:08:09,444
This is Stan Gamboa
from lnternal Revenue...

903
01:08:09,527 --> 01:08:12,246
- Yeah, right, stan.
- ..set up a time for your audit. Call me.

904
01:08:12,327 --> 01:08:14,966
Yeah, I'II caII ya. sure. Fat chance.

905
01:08:17,727 --> 01:08:21,640
(Tracy) Dooley, listen carefully.
l'm with some people right now.

906
01:08:21,727 --> 01:08:23,957
They came to the house.

907
01:08:24,047 --> 01:08:26,880
Dooley, you have to do
what they say. Please.

908
01:08:27,447 --> 01:08:29,119
Dooley?

909
01:08:34,647 --> 01:08:37,525
(man) Tracy's real smart.
She's behaving.

910
01:08:37,607 --> 01:08:40,485
You gotta be smart too
if you wanna see her again.

911
01:08:40,567 --> 01:08:45,800
That shipment you're chasin', just
let it go. Stay home tonight. Don't leave.

912
01:08:45,887 --> 01:08:48,879
Do your part and you'll have breakfast
with your girl tomorrow.

913
01:08:48,967 --> 01:08:50,958
And don't push this any more.

914
01:08:55,047 --> 01:08:56,958
(Final bleeps)

915
01:09:00,207 --> 01:09:02,880
(whimpers)

916
01:09:18,567 --> 01:09:20,717
Wash it, wax it, put a windshieId in.

917
01:09:28,647 --> 01:09:30,558
(doorbell)

918
01:09:34,767 --> 01:09:36,200
Hi!

919
01:09:42,247 --> 01:09:44,966
- Hey.
- It's by invitation onIy.

920
01:09:45,047 --> 01:09:47,003
- CaII the cops.
- You don't beIong here.

921
01:09:47,087 --> 01:09:49,317
CaII the cops.

922
01:09:53,807 --> 01:09:56,480
sorry we're Iate!

923
01:09:58,407 --> 01:10:00,318
Ken!

924
01:10:02,167 --> 01:10:06,206
This is a bitchin' pad, man!
You got a pooI in your dining room!

925
01:10:06,287 --> 01:10:08,357
You know, I gotta get one of these.

926
01:10:08,527 --> 01:10:12,520
Hey, I'm sorry Tracy couIdn't make it,
but she kinda disappeared on me.

927
01:10:12,607 --> 01:10:16,122
But the invitation did say bring a guest,
so I brought Jerry Lee.

928
01:10:16,207 --> 01:10:19,882
- Why don't you mingIe with the guests?
- I'm gonna have to ask you to Ieave.

929
01:10:19,967 --> 01:10:22,276
Ken, come on now. I just got here.

930
01:10:22,367 --> 01:10:25,086
- PIease escort this man to the door.
- Freeze!

931
01:10:27,487 --> 01:10:29,796
Oh, I'm not gonna shoot you.

932
01:10:29,887 --> 01:10:33,163
You guys are good guys.
He's the bad guy.

933
01:10:33,247 --> 01:10:35,966
Ken, I'd have a seat.
You don't Iook too good.

934
01:10:36,047 --> 01:10:39,357
WeII, I think we'd best aII do as he says.

935
01:10:39,447 --> 01:10:41,756
No, Ken, just you. Not ''we'' - ''you''.

936
01:10:41,847 --> 01:10:44,281
This poor man is obviousIy
confused and upset.

937
01:10:44,367 --> 01:10:46,927
Upset? Do I Iook upset to you?

938
01:10:47,007 --> 01:10:49,521
Am I upset? Do I Iook upset?
I'm not upset.

939
01:10:49,607 --> 01:10:52,485
I'm a party animaI! I Iove parties, Ken!

940
01:10:52,567 --> 01:10:54,956
Come on! What's the grub Iike?

941
01:10:55,247 --> 01:10:57,283
Hm.

942
01:10:57,367 --> 01:11:00,040
This wine sucks. Is this crystaI?

943
01:11:00,567 --> 01:11:01,761
(glass shatters)

944
01:11:01,847 --> 01:11:04,156
Doesn't have the ring.
Don't think it's crystaI.

945
01:11:04,447 --> 01:11:06,563
I'm pretty disappointed in this man here.

946
01:11:06,647 --> 01:11:08,956
For a murderer and
a kidnapper and a drug runner,

947
01:11:09,047 --> 01:11:12,517
I thought you'd have a IittIe better taste.
I mean, where's the brew?

948
01:11:12,607 --> 01:11:15,724
Where's the sounds?
And the Iighting in here sucks.

949
01:11:17,247 --> 01:11:19,966
That's better. It's a IittIe more intimate.

950
01:11:20,047 --> 01:11:21,924
sets the mood.

951
01:11:22,007 --> 01:11:26,285
What's that, Ken? Is that an ice scuIpture?
somebody win that? Is this raffIed off?

952
01:11:26,367 --> 01:11:28,676
Is this something you do
in your part time?

953
01:11:28,767 --> 01:11:31,486
Between the kidnapping
and the drugs and the murders?

954
01:11:31,567 --> 01:11:33,478
You make that yourseIf, Ken?

955
01:11:34,527 --> 01:11:36,802
Who is that, Ken? Is that you?

956
01:11:36,887 --> 01:11:38,240
No, that's Zeus.

957
01:11:42,807 --> 01:11:44,798
I hate mythoIogy.

958
01:11:45,567 --> 01:11:48,365
WeII, Mr HaIstead,
surprised to see you here.

959
01:11:48,447 --> 01:11:50,722
- Don't be tense. Just reIax.
- (distant siren)

960
01:11:50,807 --> 01:11:53,367
You know, most of you
Iook Iike very nice peopIe.

961
01:11:53,447 --> 01:11:56,120
It surprises me that you're here,
mixing with scum.

962
01:11:56,447 --> 01:11:59,200
I mean, the kind of scum
that kidnaps my girIfriend.

963
01:11:59,687 --> 01:12:02,440
You're making a terribIe mistake.

964
01:12:02,527 --> 01:12:04,722
Does that Iook Iike a mistake to you?

965
01:12:04,807 --> 01:12:09,164
- Does that Iook Iike a 9mm mistake?
- Put it down, mister! Drop it, mister!

966
01:12:09,247 --> 01:12:12,876
TeII me if it's a mistake to bIow
your brains against the waII, Lyman.

967
01:12:12,967 --> 01:12:15,606
- Where is she?!
- DooIey, put the gun down.

968
01:12:15,687 --> 01:12:18,724
- Gimme the gun, DooIey.
- shame you have to Ieave so earIy.

969
01:12:18,807 --> 01:12:22,163
- You reaIIy are the Iife of the party.
- You're goin' down, Lyman.

970
01:12:22,247 --> 01:12:24,477
Perhaps next time
you can bring your Iady friend.

971
01:12:24,567 --> 01:12:28,242
- You're goin' down, Lyman.
- see? see? The man is a Iunatic.

972
01:12:28,327 --> 01:12:31,399
- Outta controI.
- You can arrest me, Lyman! Go ahead!

973
01:12:31,487 --> 01:12:33,796
- But you know what?
- I'II have you prosecuted!

974
01:12:33,887 --> 01:12:38,199
I'II make baiI in 24 hours, and they'II
have to peeI me off you with a crowbar!

975
01:12:38,287 --> 01:12:40,403
You're goin' down, buddy!

976
01:12:40,487 --> 01:12:43,684
I'm gonna have your ass
behind bars permanentIy!

977
01:12:44,807 --> 01:12:47,879
And get that damn dog off my tabIe.

978
01:12:49,487 --> 01:12:52,718
(Dooley) Just Iet me outta
this goddamn cage, wiII ya?

979
01:12:58,007 --> 01:13:00,077
Byers! Byers!

980
01:13:00,927 --> 01:13:04,203
Rog, Rog. Jesus, am I gIad you're here,
man. Cut me Ioose now, wiII ya?

981
01:13:04,287 --> 01:13:08,678
- You bIew it. You are out of controI.
- No, I tried to convince Lyman I'm crazy.

982
01:13:08,767 --> 01:13:11,520
- I got news for you: you are crazy.
- Listen to me, Roger.

983
01:13:11,607 --> 01:13:15,680
Lyman's got Tracy. He kidnapped her
to keep me from that shipment.

984
01:13:15,767 --> 01:13:18,520
- I wouIdn't Iie to you.
- sure you wouId. You aIways do.

985
01:13:18,607 --> 01:13:22,680
Not this. I'm teIIin' you the truth. I got
an answering-machine tape to prove it.

986
01:13:22,767 --> 01:13:26,806
I had to put this move on, to convince
Lyman that I was nuts. I had to con him.

987
01:13:26,887 --> 01:13:31,597
Put yourseIf in his position. He thinks
for the next 24 hours I'm behind bars.

988
01:13:31,687 --> 01:13:35,236
What wouId you do? You'd move that
shipment of dope before I made baiI.

989
01:13:35,327 --> 01:13:38,000
That's what you'd do.
The deaI is goin' down tonight.

990
01:13:38,087 --> 01:13:40,362
I gotta be there. You gotta Iet me out now.

991
01:13:40,447 --> 01:13:45,646
I don't wanna hear it. It's your buIIshit
that got Tracy invoIved in the first pIace.

992
01:13:45,727 --> 01:13:47,957
From here on in,
this is a coordinated effort.

993
01:13:48,047 --> 01:13:50,880
That means you, me,
and the rest of the department.

994
01:13:51,007 --> 01:13:52,918
Let's go.

995
01:14:05,047 --> 01:14:07,766
- Oh, what is that?!
- God, who Iet that one go?

996
01:14:07,847 --> 01:14:11,362
- How couId you fart in a cIosed car?
- He did it. He ate chiIIi today.

997
01:14:11,447 --> 01:14:14,439
- I'm roIIin' my window down.
- You gotta Iet him go.

998
01:14:14,527 --> 01:14:16,597
- PuII over, wouId you?
- I'm puIIing over.

999
01:14:16,687 --> 01:14:19,281
- Get some air in here.
- (Dooley) There he goes again.

1000
01:14:19,367 --> 01:14:22,757
I'm sorry. Hey, I'm the one
stuck in the back seat here.

1001
01:14:22,847 --> 01:14:24,758
- I'm puIIin' over.
- It stinks.

1002
01:14:33,807 --> 01:14:35,877
You're gonna Iose your badge, go to jaiI.

1003
01:14:35,967 --> 01:14:39,084
Every minute we wait,
there's another chance Tracy'II get hurt.

1004
01:14:39,167 --> 01:14:43,683
- I don't care. You're outta controI.
- I'm not outta controI. It was a pIanned...

1005
01:14:43,767 --> 01:14:46,725
- How Iong wiII it take this dog to piss?
- I don't know.

1006
01:14:46,807 --> 01:14:49,480
OK, come on. Let's go.
Get him back in here!

1007
01:14:49,567 --> 01:14:52,127
I can't find him.
I don't know where he went.

1008
01:14:57,047 --> 01:15:00,596
- Get the damn dog.
- I don't know where he is.

1009
01:15:01,087 --> 01:15:03,601
Down here a minute ago.
I don't know where he went.

1010
01:15:03,687 --> 01:15:07,236
- Where the heII did he go?
- Jerry Lee, shake it off! Let's go!

1011
01:15:11,487 --> 01:15:14,320
I reaIIy need this.
Waiting for some mutt...

1012
01:15:14,407 --> 01:15:16,762
Come here, boy. HoId them.

1013
01:15:18,167 --> 01:15:20,635
- What is this?
- He's tense. You rushed him.

1014
01:15:21,007 --> 01:15:23,362
Get in the back seat.

1015
01:15:23,567 --> 01:15:26,365
He's very touchy about that back seat.

1016
01:15:26,447 --> 01:15:28,756
You're in deep enough as it is.
Now caII him off.

1017
01:15:28,847 --> 01:15:32,522
Hey, no way. Once he gets somethin'
into his head, there's nothing I can do.

1018
01:15:32,607 --> 01:15:36,122
- Look at him. He's nuts!
- Damn it, DooIey, this is it.

1019
01:15:36,207 --> 01:15:38,880
I have no time for
coordinated efforts, understand?

1020
01:15:38,967 --> 01:15:41,242
They move that Ioad, and Tracy's dead.

1021
01:15:43,127 --> 01:15:44,879
Jerry Lee, come!

1022
01:15:46,367 --> 01:15:48,278
Damn it, DooIey!

1023
01:15:56,847 --> 01:16:01,602
OK, this is how it works.
The guy moves, he jumps into the cIear,

1024
01:16:01,687 --> 01:16:05,316
- I shoot and...
- (electronic laughter)

1025
01:16:05,407 --> 01:16:09,195
And I miss and I Iose. Great.

1026
01:16:09,287 --> 01:16:12,836
It's supposed to make this great big noise,
Iike appIause, if you win.

1027
01:16:12,927 --> 01:16:16,158
I can onIy assume that's true,
because I've never won.

1028
01:16:17,927 --> 01:16:20,680
They gotta show up soon.
I mean, the stash is here.

1029
01:16:20,767 --> 01:16:23,281
You know, we find them, we'II find her.

1030
01:16:23,367 --> 01:16:26,598
I know it's a Iong shot,
but it's the onIy shot we got, right?

1031
01:16:26,687 --> 01:16:28,325
Right?

1032
01:16:33,087 --> 01:16:36,477
You know, I met her on the beach
in La JoIIa about four years ago.

1033
01:16:36,567 --> 01:16:38,603
I was in a toiIet with these binocuIars.

1034
01:16:38,687 --> 01:16:41,884
I was checkin' out these kids
seIIing some weed down on the beach.

1035
01:16:41,967 --> 01:16:43,958
It was hot that day.

1036
01:16:44,047 --> 01:16:46,197
That bathroom smeIIed Iike...

1037
01:16:46,287 --> 01:16:48,403
weII, a Iot Iike you do, you know?

1038
01:16:48,487 --> 01:16:52,878
so I'm scopin' out the sand, and bam!
I come across this goddess.

1039
01:16:53,967 --> 01:16:58,563
Forget the kids. I'm not watchin'
the kids any more, I'm watchin' her.

1040
01:16:58,647 --> 01:17:00,683
she's reading, right?

1041
01:17:00,767 --> 01:17:04,282
she stops, she puts the book down,

1042
01:17:04,367 --> 01:17:08,155
she reaches into her pocket
and puIIs out a chapstick.

1043
01:17:08,247 --> 01:17:10,283
And she puts it to her Iips.

1044
01:17:12,047 --> 01:17:13,878
AII right, I'm goin' nuts.

1045
01:17:13,967 --> 01:17:18,085
I know it's just a chapstick, but it's the
most erotic thing I've ever seen in my Iife.

1046
01:17:18,167 --> 01:17:21,796
AII of a sudden I feeI reaI uncomfortabIe,
Iike I'm invading her privacy.

1047
01:17:21,887 --> 01:17:25,880
I'm feeIin' sIeazy, which is reaIIy weird
because I usuaIIy Iike that feeIing.

1048
01:17:25,967 --> 01:17:30,199
so anyway, I get up. I waIk toward her,
you know, I go out of the john.

1049
01:17:30,287 --> 01:17:34,644
I'm sweatin' Iike a whore in church.
I got toiIet paper draggin' around my feet.

1050
01:17:34,727 --> 01:17:39,278
I Iook Iike I shouId be in a straitjacket.
I waIk up, Iook down at her, she Iooks up.

1051
01:17:39,967 --> 01:17:41,878
she puIIs these gIasses down.

1052
01:17:43,167 --> 01:17:48,605
she says to me ''I'm reading Journey
to the End of the Night, by CeIine.''

1053
01:17:48,687 --> 01:17:50,723
''The originaI French version.''

1054
01:17:51,527 --> 01:17:53,438
''Have you read it?''

1055
01:17:54,327 --> 01:17:56,841
Have I read it, she asks, right?

1056
01:17:57,567 --> 01:18:01,526
I mean, she just naturaIIy assumes
I'm, Iike, this reguIar person.

1057
01:18:01,607 --> 01:18:04,917
Not some schmo cop. Have I read it?

1058
01:18:07,287 --> 01:18:10,404
WeII, of course I didn't read it,
but, I mean, you know.

1059
01:18:10,487 --> 01:18:12,796
she just, Iike, Iooked at me, you know.

1060
01:18:14,447 --> 01:18:16,802
God, I Ioved her for that, you know.

1061
01:18:18,967 --> 01:18:20,878
What's the matter?

1062
01:18:23,607 --> 01:18:25,518
HeIIo.

1063
01:18:35,887 --> 01:18:38,606
(Dooley) HaIstead. Damn.

1064
01:18:38,687 --> 01:18:40,598
Left the party too earIy, buddy.

1065
01:18:52,127 --> 01:18:56,882
Oh, bingo. Red Mercedes.
Here we are. We're on, buddy.

1066
01:18:56,967 --> 01:18:58,878
(siren)

1067
01:19:07,687 --> 01:19:10,485
HaIstead! PuII over to the side of the road!

1068
01:19:11,927 --> 01:19:14,600
Come on, HaIstead, caII it a night!

1069
01:20:06,367 --> 01:20:07,800
Arghhh!

1070
01:20:08,767 --> 01:20:10,678
(sharp braking)

1071
01:20:14,847 --> 01:20:16,917
I'II be damned.

1072
01:20:25,367 --> 01:20:28,086
- I shouIda kiIIed him.
- You shouIda ducked.

1073
01:20:29,887 --> 01:20:33,641
I couId've taken him out right there.
Then he'd be done. End of story.

1074
01:20:33,727 --> 01:20:37,037
DooIey is yours.
The girI is yours. A gift from me.

1075
01:20:37,127 --> 01:20:41,405
Make it as messy and painfuI as you
want, but Iater. Right now I need you here.

1076
01:20:41,487 --> 01:20:45,446
Concentrate. Focus on
the business at hand.

1077
01:20:45,527 --> 01:20:47,677
- HaIstead is Iate.
- What's a few minutes?

1078
01:20:47,767 --> 01:20:51,237
HaIstead is never Iate.
scuIIey, pour me a brandy, wiII ya?

1079
01:20:51,327 --> 01:20:53,238
I'II get it.

1080
01:21:00,127 --> 01:21:02,083
How you doin', sweet pants?

1081
01:21:03,367 --> 01:21:06,006
I can't wait to bump into your boyfriend.

1082
01:21:07,087 --> 01:21:09,157
HeII, I might even pay his baiI.

1083
01:21:09,647 --> 01:21:13,003
see, I got a present for him.
A CoIombian necktie.

1084
01:21:13,927 --> 01:21:15,838
Know what that is?

1085
01:21:16,407 --> 01:21:19,956
First you sIit his throat, then you reach in,
grab his tongue, rip it out,

1086
01:21:20,047 --> 01:21:22,766
and you just Ieave it
hangin' Iike a necktie.

1087
01:21:22,847 --> 01:21:25,077
And you and me gonna party, babe.

1088
01:21:26,487 --> 01:21:28,284
Why not?

1089
01:21:29,807 --> 01:21:32,196
Come here.

1090
01:21:33,207 --> 01:21:35,118
Come here.

1091
01:21:36,407 --> 01:21:38,318
Oh, God.

1092
01:21:39,207 --> 01:21:41,118
You bitch!

1093
01:21:42,647 --> 01:21:45,719
WeII, it's about time.

1094
01:21:48,367 --> 01:21:49,720
Later.

1095
01:22:12,567 --> 01:22:15,240
- You're Iate!
- Yeah, traffic's a bitch.

1096
01:22:16,327 --> 01:22:18,602
Hey, bad idea.

1097
01:22:18,687 --> 01:22:20,882
- I press this and the cocaine goes boom.
- Easy.

1098
01:22:20,967 --> 01:22:23,765
I got 20 pounds
of expIosives in this truck.

1099
01:22:23,847 --> 01:22:26,759
This IittIe baby here sends a signaI,
we got Iiftoff.

1100
01:22:26,847 --> 01:22:29,884
It snows in san Diego.

1101
01:22:29,967 --> 01:22:33,039
Look, Lyman, I got somethin' you want,
you got somethin' I want.

1102
01:22:33,127 --> 01:22:37,006
I don't care about you or your drugs
any more. I want the girI and I want out.

1103
01:22:42,287 --> 01:22:44,642
scuIIey! Bring the girI.

1104
01:22:52,847 --> 01:22:54,997
It's gonna be aII right, honey.

1105
01:22:55,087 --> 01:22:58,124
It's gonna be aII right, baby.
We'II be outta here.

1106
01:22:59,967 --> 01:23:03,118
You know what?
I think you're connin' me.

1107
01:23:04,007 --> 01:23:06,805
I think I shouId have DiIIon here
just cut you in haIf.

1108
01:23:07,687 --> 01:23:09,598
Go ahead.

1109
01:23:10,647 --> 01:23:12,558
Go ahead!

1110
01:23:13,887 --> 01:23:16,606
Here comes your heIicopter.

1111
01:23:17,367 --> 01:23:19,881
Here comes your 50 miIIion.

1112
01:23:19,967 --> 01:23:23,926
Boy, I'd sure hate to waste that
on a dumb cop and his girIfriend.

1113
01:23:26,007 --> 01:23:27,918
What's it gonna be, Lyman?

1114
01:23:34,887 --> 01:23:36,878
Cut her Ioose.

1115
01:23:38,847 --> 01:23:40,758
You're a dead man, DooIey.

1116
01:23:40,847 --> 01:23:43,919
I'II find ya. And when I do,
I'm gonna kiII ya.

1117
01:23:45,967 --> 01:23:47,878
WaIk.

1118
01:23:57,767 --> 01:23:59,564
(electronic laughter)

1119
01:24:11,687 --> 01:24:13,882
Jerry, get off him!

1120
01:24:15,327 --> 01:24:17,045
Get off!

1121
01:24:17,967 --> 01:24:20,242
Jerry, off!

1122
01:24:50,207 --> 01:24:52,118
(whimpers)

1123
01:25:05,047 --> 01:25:07,356
(shouts)

1124
01:25:18,647 --> 01:25:20,922
- Jesus!
- We gotta get him outta here.

1125
01:25:21,007 --> 01:25:22,918
Cover him, cover him.

1126
01:25:25,167 --> 01:25:27,635
- (Tracy) Come on.
- It's aII right, buddy.

1127
01:25:33,847 --> 01:25:35,758
It's aII right, buddy.

1128
01:25:38,927 --> 01:25:40,918
It's OK, buddy. Hang in there.

1129
01:26:15,047 --> 01:26:17,925
Gunshot wound. Can you show me
which way to Emergency?

1130
01:26:18,007 --> 01:26:20,646
- sir, that is a dog.
- Yes, it's a dog and he's been shot.

1131
01:26:20,727 --> 01:26:23,116
- This is a hospitaI.
- I'm a poIice officer, Iady.

1132
01:26:23,207 --> 01:26:25,880
- You can't bring that dog in here.
- He's bIeeding to death.

1133
01:26:25,967 --> 01:26:28,686
- We don't treat animaIs.
- I don't have time to argue.

1134
01:26:28,767 --> 01:26:30,803
Can you just show me
where the doctors are?

1135
01:26:30,887 --> 01:26:35,438
- If you don't Ieave right now...
- I'm not Ieaving, Iady. I'm not Ieaving.

1136
01:26:35,527 --> 01:26:38,519
- There isn't anyone here...
- I just want one of your doctors.

1137
01:26:38,607 --> 01:26:42,316
None of them can heIp you. sit back
in the reception room and we'II try and...

1138
01:26:42,407 --> 01:26:44,762
Excuse me. Excuse me, sir.
Are you a doctor?

1139
01:26:44,847 --> 01:26:47,919
- What the heII is this?
- He says he's a poIice officer.

1140
01:26:48,007 --> 01:26:50,362
I toId him he couIdn't
bring the dog in here.

1141
01:26:50,447 --> 01:26:52,517
I have an emergency here.
I need your heIp.

1142
01:26:52,607 --> 01:26:56,156
- What's your probIem?
- It's him. He's been shot in the chest.

1143
01:26:56,247 --> 01:26:59,284
- You need to work on him now.
- There are heaIth reguIations.

1144
01:26:59,367 --> 01:27:03,201
I don't care about that. I can't take him
anywhere eIse. He's not gonna make it.

1145
01:27:03,287 --> 01:27:05,562
Look, either you heIp him now
or he's gonna die.

1146
01:27:05,647 --> 01:27:08,286
Don't get so excited. It's just a dog.

1147
01:27:08,367 --> 01:27:10,835
He's not ''just'' a dog.

1148
01:27:11,927 --> 01:27:14,805
He's a cop. And he's not just
any cop. He's my partner.

1149
01:27:16,607 --> 01:27:18,757
Do you know about medicine?

1150
01:27:18,847 --> 01:27:20,917
Do you know how to remove a buIIet?

1151
01:27:24,767 --> 01:27:26,803
I can remove the buIIet.

1152
01:27:27,247 --> 01:27:30,364
I need some heIp in here!
Let's move this dog now.

1153
01:27:30,447 --> 01:27:32,358
Let's go. Come on.

1154
01:27:35,007 --> 01:27:38,238
He's gonna be fine.
He's gonna be aII right. He's tough.

1155
01:27:38,327 --> 01:27:42,923
Did I teII you what he did in the bar?
He saved my ass in the bar, Jerry Lee.

1156
01:27:43,007 --> 01:27:46,920
I mean, that's his job. His job is
to take a buIIet. That's what K-9s are for.

1157
01:27:47,007 --> 01:27:50,124
To take the buIIet to save peopIe.
That's exactIy what he did.

1158
01:27:50,207 --> 01:27:54,837
He went between me and Lyman.
He took the buIIet. That's what they're for.

1159
01:27:55,887 --> 01:27:57,525
He's a goddamn dog, that's aII.

1160
01:27:57,607 --> 01:28:01,646
And that's what he did. He went
between me and Lyman. He took the hit.

1161
01:28:03,967 --> 01:28:07,277
He's just... just bIeedin'. He bIed a Iot.

1162
01:28:25,007 --> 01:28:27,760
You know, I've been after Lyman
for two years.

1163
01:28:28,847 --> 01:28:31,759
Two years. And it wasn't worth it.

1164
01:28:34,207 --> 01:28:37,040
It just wasn't worth it.
You couId have gotten kiIIed.

1165
01:28:37,127 --> 01:28:39,925
You too, but we didn't.
You're a good cop, DooIey.

1166
01:28:40,007 --> 01:28:42,282
Yeah, yeah, right. shoot.

1167
01:28:44,567 --> 01:28:46,683
I can't take this any more.

1168
01:29:27,127 --> 01:29:29,038
Jerry Lee?

1169
01:29:37,647 --> 01:29:39,558
(whispers) Jerry?

1170
01:29:41,167 --> 01:29:43,556
Jerry Lee, can you hear me?

1171
01:29:46,687 --> 01:29:51,477
I wish you couId hear me, because there's
a coupIe of things I wanted to teII you.

1172
01:29:51,567 --> 01:29:53,717
You know, Iike, uh...

1173
01:29:54,487 --> 01:29:58,526
Like I know our reIationship
was a IittIe rocky. OK?

1174
01:29:58,607 --> 01:30:01,405
And I know we didn't exactIy
cIick as partners.

1175
01:30:01,967 --> 01:30:05,039
And the way it Iooks now,
it doesn't Iook Iike we ever wiII.

1176
01:30:05,127 --> 01:30:08,324
I never had a dog before. I didn't know
what you were supposed to do.

1177
01:30:08,407 --> 01:30:11,763
I shouId have got a book and read
about it, is what I shouId have done.

1178
01:30:11,847 --> 01:30:15,362
But I do know now that I shouIdn't
have yeIIed at you. I yeIIed at you a Iot.

1179
01:30:15,447 --> 01:30:18,359
Even though you took the mirror
off my Mustang, you know.

1180
01:30:18,447 --> 01:30:23,282
'65 cIassic Mustang,
which I Iove. I Iove that car.

1181
01:30:23,367 --> 01:30:27,406
But it's OK. It's OK, because I know
I shouIdn't have yeIIed at you.

1182
01:30:27,487 --> 01:30:31,366
You know, and... and I know
it wasn't aII your fauIt.

1183
01:30:31,447 --> 01:30:34,007
I mean, it couId have been
partiaIIy my fauIt and...

1184
01:30:34,087 --> 01:30:38,239
OK, it was probabIy more my fauIt
than yours, and I feeI bad about that.

1185
01:30:38,327 --> 01:30:40,238
And I'm sorry.

1186
01:30:41,087 --> 01:30:45,319
You know, I mean, I Iocked you up
in cIosets aII night and yeIIed at you.

1187
01:30:45,407 --> 01:30:47,318
I put you through a car wash.

1188
01:30:48,727 --> 01:30:53,562
What eIse? I kicked you outta bed whiIe
I was trying to make Iove with Tracy.

1189
01:30:53,647 --> 01:30:56,605
That was very insensitive of me.
I know that now.

1190
01:30:57,207 --> 01:31:00,005
And we shouId have went to Vegas,
is what we shouId have done.

1191
01:31:00,087 --> 01:31:03,204
If you were around right now,
that's what we'd do - we'd go to Vegas.

1192
01:31:03,287 --> 01:31:06,359
For the weekend, you know.
We'd pick up a coupIe of broads.

1193
01:31:06,447 --> 01:31:09,962
I'd take Tracy, and we couId pick up
that IittIe poodIe with the shaved beak.

1194
01:31:10,047 --> 01:31:14,359
she was hot. Ooh, she was sexy.
I'd even Iet you sIeep with us.

1195
01:31:14,447 --> 01:31:19,237
I mean, down at the bottom of the bed,
you know, not in between us again.

1196
01:31:19,327 --> 01:31:22,842
- That was a IittIe rough.
- There you are. Been Iookin' for ya.

1197
01:31:22,927 --> 01:31:27,364
- You're not aIIowed in the recovery room.
- Yeah, I know. I was just, uh...

1198
01:31:27,447 --> 01:31:30,962
- Recovery room?
- Yeah, this is the recovery room.

1199
01:31:31,607 --> 01:31:35,202
- You mean, this is where patients, uh...?
- Come to recover.

1200
01:31:36,767 --> 01:31:39,645
- so the dog is...?
- Gonna be just fine.

1201
01:31:42,247 --> 01:31:44,158
Oh.

1202
01:31:44,847 --> 01:31:47,759
- Can I have just a coupIe of minutes?
- No probIem.

1203
01:31:54,087 --> 01:31:55,964
You asshoIe.

1204
01:31:57,407 --> 01:31:59,967
Were you Iistening to everything I said?

1205
01:32:00,047 --> 01:32:04,802
WeII, you can just forget aII of it, because
I thought I was taIkin' to a dead dog!

1206
01:32:05,287 --> 01:32:11,044
I wouIdn't take a sneaky, manipuIative,
Iying fIea circus Iike you anywhere,

1207
01:32:11,127 --> 01:32:13,766
Iet aIone Vegas. Vegas? Forget it.

1208
01:32:13,847 --> 01:32:17,317
The dog - the poodIe with
the shaved beak that you Iove so much?

1209
01:32:17,407 --> 01:32:19,318
Eat your heart out.

1210
01:32:20,327 --> 01:32:22,397
Oh, God.

1211
01:32:22,567 --> 01:32:25,035
You don't deserve to Iive. You know that?

1212
01:32:31,807 --> 01:32:33,718
But I'm gIad you did.
