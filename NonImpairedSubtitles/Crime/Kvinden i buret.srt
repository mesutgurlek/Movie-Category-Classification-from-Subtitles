1
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:22,636
The street lamp outside my bedroom--

2
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:27,191
- has been flashing for two weeks now
keeping us all awake.

3
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:32,150
So I call the council and ask them
if they've considered changing it.

4
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:35,835
What the hell do I pay my taxes for?
They're completely useless.

5
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,629
Couldn't they send a guy round to hear
if anyone wanted the bulb changed?

6
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:42,832
- Carl, relax.
- What are we waiting for?

7
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,709
I'm sick of that street lamp
flashing in the dark.

8
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,399
Anker, shut up!

9
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:52,235
Get a ladder and change the bulb.
What's the problem?

10
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:55,551
My words exactly.
What's the problem?

11
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:59,594
Why can't they send a guy round
to look at it and say:

12
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:04,231
"Hey, that needs fixing."
A small bulb could fit in a pocket.

13
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:08,399
Carl!

14
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:11,870
Carl!
Let's wait for the fucking backup.

15
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:17,629
Carl!

16
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:25,750
Jesus, Carl!
We were asked to wait.

17
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:30,349
Police!

18
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:51,272
Shit, it stinks in here.

19
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:29,033
- Shit.
- Let's go out and wait for the others.

20
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:31,116
They'll be here in five.

21
00:02:52,480 --> 00:03:00,990
THE KEEPER OF LOST CAUSES

22
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:30,909
- How are you doing?
- Fine.

23
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:34,959
- What a crappy year, huh?
- Yeah.

24
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:38,715
Why don't you take
all your sick leave?

25
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:41,838
Take another six months
and spread your wings.

26
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,753
I prefer going back to work.

27
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:50,993
- Do you still take the sedatives?
- Only at parties.

28
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:55,914
I took the mandatory three months off,
I took all your tests. I'm fine.

29
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:59,032
I can't send you back to Homicide.

30
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:01,873
- What?
- I can't. You know that, Carl.

31
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:05,350
Nobody wants to work with you. Only
Hardy and Anker could stand you.

32
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:08,956
You can't handle homicides
in your state.

33
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:11,435
But I'm fine.

34
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:15,388
That's just the way it is, Carl.
And it's not my decision alone.

35
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:18,552
I've got something else for you.

36
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:21,911
The Ministry of Justice has
funded a new department.

37
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:25,038
Department Q.

38
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:28,317
The job is to go through
the past twenty years of cold cases.

39
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:31,552
Find any errors and categorize them.

40
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:34,757
The idea is
to close a case or two a week.

41
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:38,549
You want me to go through
twenty years of cold cases?

42
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:43,669
You're always finding faults with your
colleagues. It's right up your alley.

43
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:46,593
- How many cases?
- All of them.

44
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:50,196
Twenty years of cases?
That's three years behind a desk.

45
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:53,272
- You know I'm doing you a favor.
- Marcus...

46
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:56,788
You'll get an assistant.

47
00:05:56,960 --> 00:06:00,111
I don't need an assistant.
Just tell me where to go.

48
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:03,431
- K11 in the basement.
- Thank you.

49
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:35,235
DEPARTMENT Q

50
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:40,678
You don't need to be here.

51
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:43,832
It's not like the sight of you
makes me feel better.

52
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,389
Well, thank you.

53
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:51,198
Did you talk to Vigga?

54
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:55,114
She came to see me once
at the hospital.

55
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:58,158
We ended up fighting
about who gets the house.

56
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:06,069
Minna visits every day.
She's certain I'll walk again.

57
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:17,319
I wonder when she'll realize
she has to get on with her life.

58
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:19,948
In a year or two, I guess.

59
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:23,595
It's gonna happen.

60
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:27,910
Yes.

61
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:32,829
- Hardy...
- I can't live like this.

62
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:48,670
Carl... dammit.

63
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:06,958
<i>The couple were the victims</i>
<i>of a brutal home invasion.</i>

64
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:09,913
<i>They spent 48 hours tied up -</i>

65
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:15,160
<i>- before a concerned neighbor</i>
<i>gained access to the apartment...</i>

66
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:22,391
<i>The missing 12-year-old, Mie Hansen,</i>
<i>was found dead this morning...</i>

67
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:36,353
<i>- Why are you calling, Carl?</i>
- Hi. I...

68
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:41,593
I just called to ask how you were.

69
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:43,830
<i>I'm fed up.</i>

70
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,754
<i>You can't keep calling me like this.</i>

71
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:50,036
Why not?

72
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:51,997
<i>Take care, Carl.</i>

73
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:54,276
Vigga?

74
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:36,874
Hi.

75
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:39,310
Hi...
Assad.

76
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:43,876
- Mind turning that off?
- Sure.

77
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:45,917
I've set up your office.

78
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:50,756
I've put up the cases on the wall, so
you can choose which one to start with.

79
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:54,833
What do mean you've put up...
the cases on the wall?

80
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,116
We have to close
at least three cases a week.

81
00:09:57,280 --> 00:10:01,671
This gives us a nice overview.

82
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:05,389
But tell me if you want them
placed otherwise.

83
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:15,990
Coffee?
I made some at home.

84
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:18,628
- Look, Hassan.
- Assad.

85
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:24,670
I don't know who you pissed off to end
down here. This department is a joke.

86
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:29,391
Sorting cold cases is only
for those nearing retirement.

87
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:32,028
It's the end of the road.

88
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:37,233
Do yourself a favor, pack up your stuff
and hurry back to your old department.

89
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:44,359
Boss, I've been stuck
in the depot for two years -

90
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:47,432
- with a fucking stamp in my hand.

91
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:49,636
This is a good job.

92
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:59,918
Let me know when you've decided
which cases to start with.

93
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:07,910
Damn!

94
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:23,674
Let me speak to Marcus.

95
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:26,877
- <i>Sorry, he's busy.</i>
- I'll hold.

96
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:33,189
93-YEAR-OLD MURDERED

97
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:39,834
DOUBLE MURDER

98
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:55,913
MERETE LYNGGAARD
DISAPPEARS ON FERRY

99
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:03,032
I remember this one.
It happened five years ago.

100
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:06,636
Pretty girl.
We can close that right away.

101
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:09,991
- We can?
- Read the report.

102
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:14,472
She committed suicide.
Jumped off the ferry. End of story.

103
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:20,479
- Thanks for your input.
- Was it your case?

104
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:24,519
No. I tried to get it,
but they gave it to Børge Bak.

105
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:26,432
Bak?

106
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:31,229
Not the guy you wanna call
if you need help with your crossword.

107
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:33,755
You don't think it was suicide?

108
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:36,753
Would you bring your
brain-damaged brother on a ferry -

109
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:38,711
- if you planned to jump?

110
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:41,513
- I don't have a brain-damaged brother.
- No.

111
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:44,632
- I'm joking.
- Don't you have stuff to do?

112
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:49,157
- I thought that...
- You were busy tidying up, I think.

113
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:21,275
You were great.

114
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:25,995
Thanks, Merete.

115
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:28,116
Tage is super excited -

116
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:33,195
- and wants to wine and dine
the whole group later.

117
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:36,113
You don't have to ask.
You know the answer.

118
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:04,955
Hi, Merete.

119
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:08,112
- Did you have a nice day?
- Yes. How was your day?

120
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:11,955
Okay.
Uffe got impatient in the end.

121
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:17,797
I had to show him the same episode
of "Mr. Bean" three times in a row.

122
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:19,359
- Did he eat?
- Oh yes.

123
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:22,159
- He's been in a weird mood.
- How?

124
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:26,393
He keeps staring out the window
as if he's looking for someone.

125
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:31,236
- But he never goes into the garden.
- No. I'll never quite grasp him.

126
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:36,110
- He's very fond of you, Helle.
- Good. See you tomorrow.

127
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:38,714
Bye.

128
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:44,710
Hi, Uffe.

129
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:48,598
Hey, come on.

130
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:51,593
I know it's late, but I had to work.

131
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:55,193
I missed you.

132
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:13,196
Are you going to sulk all night?

133
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:17,272
I was looking forward
to playing with you.

134
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:26,993
I had to speak
in front of 300 people today.

135
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:30,709
I don't think I'll ever get used to it.

136
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:39,557
Remember when I played a soldier
in fourth grade?

137
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:43,156
You sat in the audience
shouting out my lines to me.

138
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:48,951
Thank God I had a little brother
who'd learned the play by heart.

139
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:56,199
Isn't it my turn now?

140
00:15:57,640 --> 00:16:00,632
Uffe, you're cheating like mad.

141
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:04,349
You're cheating like crazy!

142
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:06,909
It's my turn now.

143
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:14,478
There...
You moved some of mine, didn't you?

144
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:19,509
You did, you cheat!
I'm gonna win anyway.

145
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:03,875
Uffe?

146
00:17:13,320 --> 00:17:15,470
What's wrong?

147
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:23,036
Did you see something out there?

148
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:32,310
Come on.
Back to bed.

149
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:35,556
Come.

150
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:54,071
We're not allowed to do this, are we?

151
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:59,995
- To do what?
- Investigate the cases like this.

152
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:03,709
- Like what?
- Weren't we to read and sort them?

153
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:05,751
- So you want to go back?
- No.

154
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:08,195
What's the problem then?

155
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:11,796
- I'm just saying.
- Because?

156
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:16,478
No reason.

157
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:30,191
- Coffee?
- No thanks.

158
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:33,714
Maybe later.

159
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:41,111
Lisbeth Jensen, 52, accountant, saw
Merete and her brother in the queue.

160
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:44,073
She recognized Merete from TV.
At first Uffe confused her -

161
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:48,193
- but then she recalled
reading about a sick brother.

162
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:50,191
Uffe.

163
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:56,950
Uffe, wake up.
We're boarding the ferry.

164
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:08,628
Imagine seeing you here.
I thought you guys had drivers.

165
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:12,031
That's only if you're a minister.

166
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:15,476
"Arrogant.
Not like I imagined."

167
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:18,359
"And her boyfriend just ignored us."

168
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:21,956
"They were eating sausages."

169
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:26,589
As you do 10 minutes before
you intend to jump into the sea.

170
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:38,911
They had a fight here
according to that one witness -

171
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:41,355
- they based
the first month's investigation on.

172
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:45,229
Maybe he pushed her in by accident?

173
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:49,513
Impossible.

174
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:56,793
Are you gonna be like this
all the time?

175
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:03,154
Three witnesses saw Merete
in the store after they were on deck.

176
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:05,236
They're all sure of it -

177
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:09,029
- because halfway through
the crossing it started raining.

178
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:17,750
And now the statements get muddled.

179
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:48,679
The final report says Merete and Uffe
went back to the sun deck.

180
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:53,311
A witness saw them go out
20 minutes before arrival.

181
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:55,436
They didn't return.

182
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:58,068
This is when
Merete supposedly jumped in.

183
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:01,710
Why go back out?
She didn't smoke.

184
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:05,628
It poured down until 5: 30 p.m.

185
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:12,269
This man swears
Merete entered the men's room.

186
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:16,029
His statement's useless
because he was drunk.

187
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:19,909
A pretty girl enters
while you're holding your dick.

188
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:22,793
You remember that, drunk or not.

189
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:30,874
She was looking for her brother.

190
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:38,876
The two witnesses that saw Merete
alone in the café corroborate that.

191
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:41,235
Hang on.

192
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:47,870
The guy who talked to Merete
in the café says -

193
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:51,589
- he saw Uffe
with a man in a raincoat.

194
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:54,757
Bak left that out of the report.

195
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:57,229
Who was that man?

196
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:03,232
Uffe was found alone.

197
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:07,871
Who would help a brain-damaged boy
and then leave him?

198
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:11,555
What if the three witnesses are right?

199
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:14,188
Uffe disappears, Merete looks for him.

200
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:32,633
Uffe is walking around without Merete
with a man in a dark raincoat.

201
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:44,232
Uffe?

202
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:53,672
Uffe?

203
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:09,834
Uffe?

204
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:12,877
Uffe.

205
00:24:57,960 --> 00:24:59,951
Hello?

206
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:13,271
Hello?

207
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:18,871
Hello?

208
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:45,509
<i>Hi, Merete.</i>

209
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:53,873
Where am I?

210
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:56,315
<i>In a pressure chamber.</i>

211
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:02,876
Hello?

212
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:05,838
<i>There are two buckets on the floor.</i>

213
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:09,754
<i>A toilet bucket and a food bucket.</i>

214
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:11,831
<i>There's a hatch in the door.</i>

215
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,719
<i>The buckets will be replaced</i>
<i>every 24 hours.</i>

216
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:18,594
- No, let me out.
<i>- Merete...</i>

217
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:21,399
<i>You'll never get out.</i>

218
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:23,397
Let me out!

219
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:27,439
<i>I'm increasing the pressure</i>
<i>to 2 atmospheres.</i>

220
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:33,157
<i>Your ears are going to hurt,</i>
<i>and your eardrums will rupture.</i>

221
00:26:33,320 --> 00:26:36,039
<i>You'll get used to it.</i>

222
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:45,154
Who are you, you psycho?
Why are you doing this?

223
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:47,550
Please let me out!

224
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:50,875
<i>See you in 1 year.</i>

225
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:24,470
I thought you were on sick leave.

226
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:26,551
- I'm back.
- Since when?

227
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:29,996
Merete Lynggaard, remember her?
Young, pretty, missing.

228
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:32,435
What about her?

229
00:27:32,560 --> 00:27:36,394
A key witness saw a man in a raincoat
with Merete's brother.

230
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:39,518
- Another saw Merete looking for him.
- Oh, come on.

231
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:42,911
I don't remember every detail
of a five-year-old case.

232
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:47,039
What else did you forget in the report?
You were busy with a lot of cases.

233
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:50,715
What are you doing with that case?
It's closed.

234
00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:53,957
She committed suicide.

235
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:57,510
If I'm ever murdered,
promise me not to take my case.

236
00:27:59,560 --> 00:28:01,198
Fuck you.

237
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:03,709
EGELY
NURSING HOME

238
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:21,998
Uffe was eight at the time
of the car accident.

239
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:25,556
The incurred brain trauma
is the primary cause of his state.

240
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:27,950
He lost both his parents that day -

241
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:31,795
- and that kind of experience
can provoke a dissociative disorder.

242
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:35,157
- Dissociative meaning...
- He repressed it.

243
00:28:35,320 --> 00:28:40,678
- As if it never happened.
- Yes, he's drifted out of reality.

244
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:45,633
- And when Merete disappeared?
- It may have worsened his condition.

245
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:49,677
I don't care who you are.

246
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:53,958
If you upset Uffe or the other
patients, you're out of here.

247
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:22,548
Hi, Uffe. My name's Carl,
and I'm a police officer.

248
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:26,315
I'm trying to find out
what happened to Merete.

249
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:29,159
I don't think she jumped.

250
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:32,796
And I don't think
you did anything wrong.

251
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:37,111
Did you notice a man on the ferry?

252
00:29:37,280 --> 00:29:40,909
A man that helped you
because you got lost.

253
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:44,030
Do you remember that?

254
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:47,112
He won't get anywhere.

255
00:29:47,280 --> 00:29:49,840
- Assad.
- Tereza.

256
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,719
- Is he all gone?
- No, he's in there.

257
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:56,668
But Uffe is sensitive to voices and
sounds. He doesn't like new voices.

258
00:29:56,840 --> 00:29:59,877
It took him ages to recognize me.

259
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:04,275
Uffe, did you know the man?

260
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:06,991
Uffe, look at me.

261
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:10,192
How do you know he recognizes you?

262
00:30:10,360 --> 00:30:15,070
I can see it in his eyes,
and only I get to wash and feed him.

263
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:18,676
Uffe...
Turn off the TV.

264
00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:22,719
Uffe, look at me.
Look at me.

265
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:25,633
Listen,
I'm a police officer.

266
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:31,512
Maybe there wasn't anyone.
Maybe she jumped.

267
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:34,188
Maybe I have no fucking use
for "maybe".

268
00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:36,920
Now what?
We've got a man in a raincoat.

269
00:30:37,080 --> 00:30:39,913
- It's not a lot.
- It's enough.

270
00:30:57,440 --> 00:31:00,512
TWO FAMILIES
IN TERRIBLE CAR ACCIDENT

271
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:10,869
Jesper? What are you doing here?

272
00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:14,356
Can I stay with you for a day or two?
I'm sick of my Mom.

273
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:17,397
Sure.

274
00:31:18,680 --> 00:31:23,674
- Did you clear my room, or...?
- It's all there.

275
00:31:26,360 --> 00:31:28,351
How is Vigga?

276
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:33,275
She's fucking a gallerist who pads
around in a dressing gown all day.

277
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:40,874
Why are you reopening this?

278
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:44,635
I told you everything
all those years ago.

279
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:49,357
- Is this going to get out?
- Did you kill Merete?

280
00:31:49,560 --> 00:31:53,519
- No.
- Then you've got nothing to fear.

281
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:58,350
I have nothing to add. I told
your colleague everything back then.

282
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:01,711
Have you got new leads
or whatever you call it?

283
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:04,599
Sit down.

284
00:32:04,760 --> 00:32:07,513
- Look...
- You were a couple back then, huh?

285
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:12,309
- No, we weren't a couple.
- But you were in love with her.

286
00:32:12,520 --> 00:32:15,273
We went out twice, that's all.

287
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:18,995
Why did she break it off?
Was she seeing someone else?

288
00:32:20,360 --> 00:32:24,239
I'm married. I was married.

289
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:30,719
Look, I know your boss, Jacobsen.
If the media start digging into...

290
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:32,791
Right.

291
00:32:34,760 --> 00:32:38,435
- What color is your raincoat?
- Green. Why?

292
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:42,719
You're welcome.

293
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:46,395
Sure. I understand.

294
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:49,791
That would put you on the spot.

295
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:53,508
We don't want to...

296
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:12,997
But you were her secretary.
I have an assistant -

297
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:16,948
- and it's almost like he knows me
better than I do myself.

298
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:20,996
Fine with me.
See you then, Søs.

299
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:23,071
Bye.

300
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:25,674
I want to go see Uffe again.

301
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:28,598
- Maybe get to know him better.
- Fine.

302
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:31,917
- I'll take the car.
- Have a good trip.

303
00:33:50,040 --> 00:33:52,998
Hi.
A beer, please.

304
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:56,914
- Czech, Belgian or Japanese?
- Just a beer.

305
00:33:57,080 --> 00:34:00,834
- Glass or bottle?
- Just give me a beer.

306
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:11,109
- I'll go in first and call you.
- Great.

307
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:17,474
Hello.
We're going to have a nice cup of tea.

308
00:34:17,640 --> 00:34:20,154
Here you go.

309
00:34:23,160 --> 00:34:26,277
We have a visitor today.
Assad.

310
00:34:37,240 --> 00:34:41,119
- Help yourself to a cookie, Assad.
- Thanks.

311
00:34:52,160 --> 00:34:57,109
She lived alone with her brother.
Their parents died in a car accident.

312
00:34:57,280 --> 00:35:00,317
She never went out
and didn't seem interested in men -

313
00:35:00,520 --> 00:35:03,034
- so at first I thought
she was a lesbian.

314
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:08,957
- She didn't see any men?
- Sure. She got what she needed.

315
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:13,788
- So Tage Baggesen was her...?
- She had several.

316
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:19,154
- Who was the last man she saw?
- Does it matter who she slept with?

317
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:22,915
- It does, if he killed her.
- But you don't know if she was killed.

318
00:35:23,080 --> 00:35:26,197
Why would it be someone she knew?

319
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:29,318
95% of all murders on women
are committed by the husband -

320
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:32,472
- the boyfriend
or someone they turned down.

321
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:36,751
Was she seeing anyone
just before she disappeared?

322
00:35:36,920 --> 00:35:39,753
Well...

323
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:44,875
A month before she disappeared
we were at a GHO congress.

324
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:48,276
She hooked up with someone there,
but I didn't see who.

325
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:52,558
My room was next to hers, and I heard
her get in early in the morning.

326
00:35:56,040 --> 00:35:59,510
- Anything else?
- No.

327
00:36:01,080 --> 00:36:02,957
Look...

328
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:08,513
If you haven't got plans,
I just got off work, and...

329
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:14,078
- Can I buy you a drink?
- No, thanks. I have to go.

330
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:18,438
- But good luck.
- Thanks.

331
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:31,789
Get lost!

332
00:37:18,120 --> 00:37:20,918
Mom, hand me the water, please.

333
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:32,679
I can't reach it, Mom.
Give it to me! Mom!

334
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:37,916
Give it to me, Mom.
Mommy...

335
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:42,475
Give it to me.

336
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:46,553
Today is February 8, 2009.

337
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:49,234
I've been here 127 days.

338
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:53,188
My name is Merete Lynggaard.
I'm okay.

339
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:58,428
My younger brother's name is Uffe.
He was born May 10, 1982.

340
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:01,477
I know I can survive this.

341
00:38:14,840 --> 00:38:16,671
Three -

342
00:38:16,840 --> 00:38:21,152
- four, five, six.

343
00:38:22,680 --> 00:38:25,148
Let me out!

344
00:38:25,840 --> 00:38:27,956
Let me out, you pig!

345
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:30,952
Hello!

346
00:38:31,080 --> 00:38:33,958
I know you can hear me!

347
00:38:34,120 --> 00:38:35,838
Let me out!

348
00:38:57,080 --> 00:39:00,277
Today is 28 February, 2009.

349
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:02,874
I've been here 147 days.

350
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:07,272
My name is Merete Lynggaard.
I'm okay.

351
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:13,470
My younger brother's name is Uffe.
He was born May 10, 1982...

352
00:39:13,640 --> 00:39:18,077
I know I can survive this.
I promise myself never to give up.

353
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:20,470
My name is Merete Lynggaard.
I'm okay.

354
00:39:20,680 --> 00:39:26,471
My younger brother's name is Uffe.
He was born May 10, 1982...

355
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:43,274
<i>Congratulations, Merete.</i>
<i>You survived your first year.</i>

356
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:47,149
<i>I'm going to increase the pressure</i>
<i>to 3 atmospheres.</i>

357
00:39:47,320 --> 00:39:48,992
Why are you doing this?

358
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:55,393
<i>I'll be back in 1 year.</i>

359
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:04,715
Carl.

360
00:40:10,040 --> 00:40:13,191
- Carl.
- That is <i>really</i> annoying.

361
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:17,712
You don't answer your phone.
Come on.

362
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:21,031
- Cut it out!
- Come on.

363
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:38,758
- Coffee?
- Please.

364
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:43,598
I don't believe it.

365
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:45,512
Jesper!

366
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:51,631
It's good, right?

367
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:54,837
I eat here every day.

368
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:57,673
- You eat here every day?
- Yes.

369
00:40:57,840 --> 00:41:02,038
- Every day?
- They also have salads.

370
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:09,237
- What the hell is it with you, Carl?
- What?

371
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:12,358
I don't think I've seen you smile.

372
00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:18,193
You don't care about other people.
You don't care about yourself.

373
00:41:18,360 --> 00:41:19,759
I'm worried about you.

374
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:23,708
I'm worried about when this conversation
is going to end.

375
00:41:24,360 --> 00:41:27,557
Don't you have anything
to be happy about?

376
00:41:27,720 --> 00:41:30,518
My wife left me.

377
00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:33,279
My colleague's dead,
and my best friend's a cripple.

378
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:38,716
I've seen things too, Carl.
You wouldn't believe what I've seen.

379
00:41:38,920 --> 00:41:43,311
But I believe in people.
I believe in the good in people.

380
00:41:43,480 --> 00:41:47,268
- And I can still smile.
- I don't have a lot to smile about.

381
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:51,115
- Then why are you doing this?
- Because it's all I can.

382
00:41:58,280 --> 00:42:02,956
Merete met a man at some congress in
Sweden. Get a list of the participants.

383
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:06,029
Okay.

384
00:42:07,960 --> 00:42:11,589
We just received this
from GHO in Sweden.

385
00:42:12,440 --> 00:42:16,433
- Are these all the participants?
- I guess. It was by invitation only.

386
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:22,268
Thank you, Lis.

387
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:29,036
Sort out the women.

388
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:44,952
You've posted pictures from
the congress on your website.

389
00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:52,233
So your employees posted
the pictures?

390
00:42:54,960 --> 00:42:56,552
Okay.

391
00:42:56,760 --> 00:43:02,118
Could you ask them, if they still
have those pictures? I know.

392
00:43:05,800 --> 00:43:09,918
Find the ones
of Merete talking to men.

393
00:43:38,920 --> 00:43:41,115
Getting anywhere with Uffe?

394
00:43:41,240 --> 00:43:45,677
Sure.
He recognizes my voice now.

395
00:43:58,760 --> 00:44:03,276
I've had some funny
phone calls these past days.

396
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:09,151
The head of a nursing home complained
about a rude homicide investigator.

397
00:44:09,320 --> 00:44:14,269
Tage Baggesen asked Bak why
the Lynggaard case was reopened.

398
00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:18,917
The accounts department received
a huge bill for the requisition -

399
00:44:19,080 --> 00:44:23,710
- of photos from some congress.
Carl, what is the problem?

400
00:44:25,160 --> 00:44:27,913
- I told you to sort some old cases.
- I am.

401
00:44:28,080 --> 00:44:31,197
I told you to go through them,
not reopen them. What are you doing?

402
00:44:31,360 --> 00:44:34,113
- My job.
- I personally closed that case...

403
00:44:34,280 --> 00:44:36,589
Enough, Bak!

404
00:44:38,680 --> 00:44:42,116
I've never given a damn
about what others say about you.

405
00:44:42,320 --> 00:44:44,788
Your moods and arrogance.

406
00:44:44,960 --> 00:44:48,635
What really annoys me
is your lack of respect.

407
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:50,995
Do your job.

408
00:44:51,160 --> 00:44:54,596
Close the Lynggaard case now
and file a two-page report.

409
00:44:54,800 --> 00:44:58,349
Open a new case, read it,
and file a two-page report.

410
00:44:58,520 --> 00:45:02,274
- Can I go now?
- No, I'd love it if you stayed.

411
00:45:25,240 --> 00:45:27,800
- Hi.
- What did Jacobsen have to say?

412
00:45:27,960 --> 00:45:30,394
Everything's fine. All set?

413
00:45:31,880 --> 00:45:33,916
How do we do this?

414
00:45:34,120 --> 00:45:36,315
How do we know
if he recognizes anyone?

415
00:45:36,480 --> 00:45:39,677
His eyes react when
he's favorite program comes on -

416
00:45:39,880 --> 00:45:42,997
- or when he's in a bad mood.

417
00:45:45,560 --> 00:45:49,951
- I'd better go in alone. Stay here.
- What?

418
00:45:50,120 --> 00:45:53,999
- I don't think he likes you.
- Christ, look at him.

419
00:45:54,160 --> 00:45:57,755
Stay out here.
Hi, Uffe.

420
00:46:00,320 --> 00:46:04,598
Uffe, I've brought
a lot of pictures of Merete.

421
00:46:04,760 --> 00:46:08,753
I like Merete, and I want to know
what happened to her.

422
00:46:10,160 --> 00:46:15,154
I know you miss her but don't be upset
when you see her.

423
00:46:17,080 --> 00:46:20,914
I'm going to show you
the pictures now.

424
00:46:24,560 --> 00:46:28,712
I know it's not as exciting as the TV,
but look at the picture.

425
00:46:30,280 --> 00:46:33,033
Look at the picture, Uffe.

426
00:46:49,120 --> 00:46:51,509
Good.

427
00:48:59,360 --> 00:49:02,397
- Him?
- No.

428
00:49:09,400 --> 00:49:10,958
No.

429
00:49:11,160 --> 00:49:13,754
It just can't be true.

430
00:49:15,800 --> 00:49:18,155
Assad.

431
00:49:27,160 --> 00:49:29,720
Daniel Hale.

432
00:49:29,880 --> 00:49:34,078
Daniel Hale.
Bio Dynamics. Gothenburg.

433
00:52:23,720 --> 00:52:27,872
<i>Merete, I think</i>
<i>you should clean the window.</i>

434
00:52:32,440 --> 00:52:35,273
<i>Did you hear me?</i>
<i>Clean the window.</i>

435
00:52:41,800 --> 00:52:43,836
Who are you?

436
00:52:45,440 --> 00:52:48,477
<i>Clean the window, Merete.</i>

437
00:52:50,720 --> 00:52:53,553
<i>Clean the window, Merete!</i>

438
00:52:54,840 --> 00:52:57,957
<i>The pressure will increase</i>
<i>until you clean the window.</i>

439
00:53:01,680 --> 00:53:04,478
<i>Do as I say!</i>
<i>Clean the window!</i>

440
00:53:06,920 --> 00:53:09,115
<i>Clean the window!</i>

441
00:53:10,360 --> 00:53:13,272
<i>Clean the window, now!</i>

442
00:53:35,440 --> 00:53:39,194
Daniel Hale, Bio Dynamics.
Gothenburg.

443
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:44,551
Because he doesn't need to know
that we're looking for him.

444
00:53:44,760 --> 00:53:47,115
Thank you.

445
00:53:51,160 --> 00:53:55,392
- Oh, come on, I can't drink this crap.
- I made it mild especially for you.

446
00:53:55,560 --> 00:53:57,915
Yes?

447
00:53:59,600 --> 00:54:02,068
How...?

448
00:54:05,080 --> 00:54:07,799
Thanks.

449
00:54:07,960 --> 00:54:11,839
- What did they say?
- Daniel Hale is dead.

450
00:54:11,960 --> 00:54:16,238
- What?
- Just after Merete disappeared.

451
00:54:17,200 --> 00:54:20,909
- He drowned in a boating accident.
- Shit!

452
00:54:27,520 --> 00:54:30,512
- What are they doing in Sweden?
- I don't know.

453
00:54:30,680 --> 00:54:33,035
Get them on the phone.

454
00:54:36,960 --> 00:54:41,715
I read the report when you called and
put Post-its on the significant info.

455
00:54:42,600 --> 00:54:45,239
You just graduated from the academy?

456
00:54:45,400 --> 00:54:47,197
Yes.

457
00:54:49,600 --> 00:54:52,717
Is it windy out here
in late summer?

458
00:54:52,920 --> 00:54:56,230
- Is it windy here in late summer?
- No.

459
00:54:56,400 --> 00:55:00,075
How cold is the water in August?

460
00:55:00,240 --> 00:55:03,949
17 or 18 degrees Celsius.

461
00:55:04,120 --> 00:55:07,351
- You knew Daniel?
- No.

462
00:55:08,320 --> 00:55:12,359
But he fished here every year
and bought bait off you.

463
00:55:12,520 --> 00:55:16,308
- Sure, but I didn't know him.
- Was he always alone?

464
00:55:16,480 --> 00:55:19,074
Not always.

465
00:55:19,240 --> 00:55:23,597
Did you see him with someone
the day he disappeared?

466
00:55:25,760 --> 00:55:29,389
- Maybe. It's hard to say.
- Carl.

467
00:55:31,040 --> 00:55:33,998
We have a problem.

468
00:55:36,920 --> 00:55:39,753
Who the hell's that?

469
00:55:41,520 --> 00:55:43,795
- That's Hale.
- Daniel Hale?

470
00:55:43,960 --> 00:55:45,791
Yes.

471
00:55:49,400 --> 00:55:51,470
Then who is this?

472
00:55:51,640 --> 00:55:54,712
I don't know.

473
00:56:00,920 --> 00:56:04,276
Have you seen this guy with this guy?

474
00:56:05,400 --> 00:56:07,595
Maybe.

475
00:56:09,120 --> 00:56:14,638
So the man in the raincoat posed
as Hale to get into the congress -

476
00:56:14,760 --> 00:56:18,639
- and then six months later
he killed the real Hale.

477
00:56:18,800 --> 00:56:22,395
Why kill him
unless he knew something?

478
00:56:22,560 --> 00:56:26,109
Hale and the false Hale
knew each other.

479
00:56:26,280 --> 00:56:30,068
Daniel's partner of four years.
Johan Lundquist.

480
00:56:30,240 --> 00:56:34,631
Copenhagen police called.
You're not allowed to be here.

481
00:56:34,800 --> 00:56:38,713
- But that's absurd.
- I'm to escort you to the border.

482
00:56:38,840 --> 00:56:41,991
- And I need the report back.
- Let me sort this out.

483
00:56:42,160 --> 00:56:44,799
I'll call them.
Thanks for letting us know.

484
00:56:44,960 --> 00:56:47,997
- I need the report back.
- Sure.

485
00:56:48,160 --> 00:56:51,277
- Is it true?
- Yes. Here you go.

486
00:56:51,440 --> 00:56:54,193
I've got the report...

487
00:56:55,640 --> 00:56:59,235
- No, Carl.
- They're taking off!

488
00:57:06,520 --> 00:57:10,559
You should have told me.
I'm your partner, for fuck's sake.

489
00:57:10,720 --> 00:57:13,837
- Lundquist?
- Up there.

490
00:57:14,920 --> 00:57:18,469
- Johan Lundquist?
- Yes.

491
00:57:18,640 --> 00:57:22,349
Carl Mørck, Danish police. You were
Daniel Hale's partner until he died.

492
00:57:22,520 --> 00:57:24,556
Yes?

493
00:57:24,720 --> 00:57:29,271
We've reopened Merete Lynggaard's
case. She disappeared five years ago.

494
00:57:29,440 --> 00:57:31,635
We've come across Daniel's name -

495
00:57:31,800 --> 00:57:35,395
- and we're trying to find out
if his death wasn't an accident.

496
00:57:35,560 --> 00:57:39,189
- But do you think he was...?
- He may have been involved...

497
00:57:39,320 --> 00:57:41,629
- We think he was murdered.
- Carl.

498
00:57:46,440 --> 00:57:48,396
Do you know this man?

499
00:57:48,600 --> 00:57:50,750
That's Lasse.

500
00:57:52,680 --> 00:57:54,910
Lasse?

501
00:57:55,080 --> 00:57:57,355
He was...

502
00:57:57,480 --> 00:58:00,836
He and Daniel grew up together
at an orphanage in Denmark.

503
00:58:01,040 --> 00:58:03,873
That's how they met.

504
00:58:05,880 --> 00:58:10,237
Daniel never really talked about him.
I thought they had a thing going.

505
00:58:10,400 --> 00:58:13,278
- Have you got his number or address?
- No.

506
00:58:13,480 --> 00:58:16,631
I only met him a couple of times.

507
00:58:16,800 --> 00:58:21,590
Do you remember the name
of the orphanage or the address?

508
00:58:21,760 --> 00:58:23,432
Denmark.

509
00:58:32,320 --> 00:58:33,799
Hello there.

510
00:58:39,640 --> 00:58:42,598
<i>Have you figured out</i>
<i>why you're here?</i>

511
00:59:01,280 --> 00:59:04,590
<i>Merete, would you like to see</i>
<i>who I am?</i>

512
00:59:08,880 --> 00:59:12,759
<i>I'm going to turn on the light</i>
<i>out here for 30 seconds.</i>

513
01:00:11,880 --> 01:00:15,190
Daniel.
Your name is Daniel.

514
01:00:15,400 --> 01:00:19,029
Why are you doing this?
What have I done to you? Who are you?

515
01:00:19,240 --> 01:00:22,676
<i>- Think, Merete.</i>
- Wait! Wait!

516
01:00:24,080 --> 01:00:27,709
<i>- Next time you see me, you'll die.</i>
- Who are you?

517
01:00:27,920 --> 01:00:30,639
Lasse took Daniel Hale's identity.

518
01:00:30,840 --> 01:00:35,072
Where's the motive? You can't place
Lasse at Merete's hotel or the ferry.

519
01:00:35,240 --> 01:00:39,950
- Lasse took Daniel Hale's identity.
- You want a homicide so bad...

520
01:00:40,120 --> 01:00:44,159
- Shut up.
- Shut up, both of you!

521
01:00:44,320 --> 01:00:46,788
You can't follow orders -

522
01:00:46,960 --> 01:00:50,430
- and you're not doing the job
the Ministry asked me to do.

523
01:00:50,600 --> 01:00:53,160
You bungle around -

524
01:00:53,320 --> 01:00:56,471
- spend three months' budget
in two days, involve Swedish police -

525
01:00:56,680 --> 01:01:01,276
- and the nursing home is suing us
because you traumatized their patient.

526
01:01:01,480 --> 01:01:04,870
One last thing.
They stayed at the same orphanage...

527
01:01:05,040 --> 01:01:06,075
Carl!

528
01:01:06,280 --> 01:01:08,077
Yes.

529
01:01:09,240 --> 01:01:11,071
Enough is enough.

530
01:01:13,760 --> 01:01:15,876
What?

531
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:20,719
You're both suspended -

532
01:01:20,880 --> 01:01:23,838
- until I find a place for you.

533
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:27,560
I've had it.

534
01:01:46,040 --> 01:01:49,191
I gave you a chance, Assad.

535
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:34,878
Hey, that's funny.

536
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:39,869
When you don't have me to keep you
in line, you fuck everything up.

537
01:02:41,240 --> 01:02:44,277
What are you gonna do, Carl?

538
01:02:44,440 --> 01:02:48,228
Write crime novels
like all the other retired cops?

539
01:02:48,360 --> 01:02:53,115
It doesn't matter.
Nothing matters one bit.

540
01:03:01,960 --> 01:03:05,669
- I'm going home to get some sleep.
- You're such a pain in the ass.

541
01:03:07,640 --> 01:03:09,631
You're the most stubborn person I know -

542
01:03:09,800 --> 01:03:13,793
- but that's what makes you
the best cop I've ever met.

543
01:03:17,160 --> 01:03:21,597
Should we have entered that house
without backup?

544
01:03:22,600 --> 01:03:26,195
Of course we should.

545
01:03:30,280 --> 01:03:33,397
What if someone had been
alive in there?

546
01:03:33,520 --> 01:03:36,751
And we'd just stayed outside
on our fat asses?

547
01:03:46,520 --> 01:03:49,956
If they take away your stubbornness...

548
01:03:53,440 --> 01:03:56,398
... we might as well trade places.

549
01:04:40,880 --> 01:04:43,394
My stepson.

550
01:04:51,880 --> 01:04:53,871
I have to go on.

551
01:04:54,040 --> 01:04:56,554
I need to know what happened to her.

552
01:05:01,920 --> 01:05:06,630
- What's that?
- The orphanage where Hale grew up.

553
01:05:06,800 --> 01:05:09,633
Let's check it out.

554
01:05:09,800 --> 01:05:14,396
Are you sure about this?
You heard Jacobsen.

555
01:05:14,560 --> 01:05:17,791
My Danish isn't that good, Carl.

556
01:05:17,960 --> 01:05:19,871
Drink your coffee.

557
01:05:35,280 --> 01:05:40,559
- Are you here about Pede again?
- No, two residents 17-18 years ago.

558
01:05:40,720 --> 01:05:44,872
- That brought you here at 6: 30 a.m.?
- Yes.

559
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:48,515
- Who are you looking for?
- Two boys who used to live here.

560
01:05:48,680 --> 01:05:53,356
- One of them was Daniel Hale.
- I remember Daniel well.

561
01:05:53,520 --> 01:05:57,479
You remember everyone
who ever lived here. It's amazing.

562
01:05:57,640 --> 01:05:59,915
I don't remember a year back.

563
01:06:00,120 --> 01:06:02,475
That's why you're so good at your job.

564
01:06:02,640 --> 01:06:06,997
- Was he friends with a boy named Lasse?
- Here. Daniel Hale.

565
01:06:07,120 --> 01:06:09,839
Half Swedish.
Mom died in childbirth, dad took off.

566
01:06:09,960 --> 01:06:15,193
- Do you mean Lars? Lars Jensen?
- Lasse? Lars?

567
01:06:15,400 --> 01:06:18,756
Lars did this to me
with a bread knife -

568
01:06:18,920 --> 01:06:22,754
- because I told him to clean up
after himself in the kitchen.

569
01:06:22,920 --> 01:06:27,755
- He was beyond reach of reason.
- Could you look up Lars Jensen?

570
01:06:27,960 --> 01:06:30,997
You're right,
everyone called him Lasse.

571
01:06:31,120 --> 01:06:34,237
He and Daniel always hung out.

572
01:06:34,400 --> 01:06:38,837
- Daniel looked up to him.
- Daniel was gay. Were they involved?

573
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:44,836
I doubt it. Lars hid girly magazines
under his mattress like all the boys.

574
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:49,630
Lars Jensen lived here for two years.
He came from a foster family.

575
01:06:49,800 --> 01:06:52,792
Six months later we're told
Lars has been found -

576
01:06:52,960 --> 01:06:55,554
- living with his mom Ulla Jensen.

577
01:06:56,280 --> 01:06:59,317
Disability pensioner.

578
01:06:59,480 --> 01:07:03,155
They were in a car accident.
Lars' father was killed -

579
01:07:03,320 --> 01:07:06,118
- and she ended up in a wheelchair.

580
01:07:06,320 --> 01:07:09,596
That's how Lars ended up
in the system.

581
01:07:16,040 --> 01:07:19,715
Here. "Uffe and Merete Lynggaard,
sole survivors."

582
01:07:19,880 --> 01:07:22,348
"In the other car,
Klaus and Susanne Jensen died."

583
01:07:22,520 --> 01:07:25,637
"Survivors: Ulla Jensen..."

584
01:07:26,880 --> 01:07:29,440
"Lars Henrik Jensen."

585
01:07:30,560 --> 01:07:32,596
Lasse.

586
01:09:50,600 --> 01:09:54,673
Lasse! Lasse!

587
01:09:55,680 --> 01:09:58,672
Welcome.

588
01:10:31,040 --> 01:10:35,272
- Well, this is your room.
- I'm Daniel.

589
01:10:36,520 --> 01:10:39,353
Hey, faggots.

590
01:11:12,360 --> 01:11:14,999
No! No...

591
01:11:34,760 --> 01:11:39,470
- What do you want at that congress?
- Can you get me in?

592
01:11:44,680 --> 01:11:46,955
BERLIN WITH UFFE

593
01:12:49,960 --> 01:12:52,428
Thanks.

594
01:12:55,200 --> 01:12:59,159
- Mom, have you had lunch?
- I'm not hungry.

595
01:13:00,560 --> 01:13:03,279
Mom, you have to eat.

596
01:13:10,640 --> 01:13:13,632
I'm going to town.
Need anything?

597
01:13:13,800 --> 01:13:15,279
No.

598
01:13:39,680 --> 01:13:44,310
Let me talk. A 70-year-old lady in the
country has only seen your kind on TV.

599
01:14:25,680 --> 01:14:27,989
Hello?

600
01:14:35,200 --> 01:14:37,475
Ulla Jensen?

601
01:14:39,520 --> 01:14:42,398
This is the police.

602
01:14:57,640 --> 01:14:59,517
Hello?

603
01:15:12,440 --> 01:15:14,510
What do you want?

604
01:15:16,440 --> 01:15:18,874
- Ulla Jensen?
- Yes.

605
01:15:19,040 --> 01:15:22,396
- We're with the police.
- How can I be sure?

606
01:15:22,600 --> 01:15:25,558
You don't look
like proper police officers.

607
01:15:25,720 --> 01:15:30,555
- We're looking for your son.
- Lars has gone to sea.

608
01:15:30,680 --> 01:15:33,433
I haven't seen him for six months.

609
01:15:33,600 --> 01:15:38,071
Come back some other time.
I can't help you.

610
01:15:38,240 --> 01:15:40,515
Do you live here alone?

611
01:15:40,680 --> 01:15:44,468
I have groceries delivered every week.

612
01:15:48,520 --> 01:15:51,751
I guess that's all for now.

613
01:15:51,920 --> 01:15:55,595
Please call us as soon as
you hear from him.

614
01:15:55,760 --> 01:15:56,670
Sure.

615
01:16:04,560 --> 01:16:07,711
- She's a bad liar.
- Do you think he's here?

616
01:16:07,880 --> 01:16:09,791
She's not alone.

617
01:16:09,960 --> 01:16:12,679
Check over there.

618
01:16:37,960 --> 01:16:43,318
<i>Merete, time's up, so I'm going</i>
<i>to let out all the air.</i>

619
01:16:43,480 --> 01:16:46,199
<i>Do you know what that means?</i>

620
01:16:48,080 --> 01:16:53,074
<i>Your blood vessels will explode.</i>
<i>Your every cell will cry out to die.</i>

621
01:16:53,200 --> 01:16:56,317
<i>But when the tank is empty,</i>
<i>it will all be over.</i>

622
01:16:56,480 --> 01:16:58,675
Why?

623
01:17:00,440 --> 01:17:02,715
Why?

624
01:17:08,760 --> 01:17:12,639
<i>December 23, 1988.</i>

625
01:17:46,760 --> 01:17:48,796
<i>Goodbye, Merete.</i>

626
01:18:34,280 --> 01:18:36,794
- Well?
- Nothing.

627
01:18:36,920 --> 01:18:38,638
Listen.

628
01:18:49,520 --> 01:18:51,112
I'll go find something in the car.

629
01:18:52,480 --> 01:18:54,869
Can I help you?

630
01:18:55,040 --> 01:18:57,952
That bar looks a bit drastic.

631
01:18:59,960 --> 01:19:03,509
You're with the police,
my mom said.

632
01:19:03,680 --> 01:19:06,638
- Did something happen?
- Funny.

633
01:19:06,800 --> 01:19:10,839
She told us you went to sea, and that
she hadn't seen you for six months.

634
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:12,638
- She said that?
- Yes.

635
01:19:12,800 --> 01:19:16,873
Did she say she was senile, too?
I was just taking a nap.

636
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:21,754
- Good boy, Lasse.
- Lasse?

637
01:19:23,080 --> 01:19:26,197
Nobody's called me that in years.

638
01:19:26,360 --> 01:19:28,316
- Not since Daniel?
- Who?

639
01:19:28,480 --> 01:19:33,429
Quit the act. We know all about
Merete Lynggaard, Daniel, the home.

640
01:19:33,560 --> 01:19:35,118
- What?
- Shut up!

641
01:19:35,280 --> 01:19:38,716
- Hey, calm down!
- Lars?

642
01:19:39,640 --> 01:19:43,076
How about coming back to the station
with us for a chat?

643
01:19:45,000 --> 01:19:47,878
Sure.

644
01:19:48,040 --> 01:19:51,157
Sure.
But you're wasting your time.

645
01:19:57,400 --> 01:19:59,755
What's in the storage hall?

646
01:19:59,920 --> 01:20:02,559
Old farm machines.
Most of them were my dad's.

647
01:20:04,560 --> 01:20:06,949
Wasn't he an engineer in the navy?

648
01:20:07,080 --> 01:20:09,275
- He was many things.
- And a farmer on the side?

649
01:20:09,440 --> 01:20:13,115
I'm not talking to you
until I have a lawyer present.

650
01:20:30,560 --> 01:20:33,438
What's the generator for?

651
01:20:37,080 --> 01:20:43,189
You have plenty of power out here,
so why use petrol for a generator?

652
01:20:45,320 --> 01:20:49,836
Unless you don't want any questions
about your power usage.

653
01:20:54,520 --> 01:20:57,671
What's in the barn, Lasse?

654
01:20:59,880 --> 01:21:03,270
Assad...
Turn around.

655
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:17,752
Assad?

656
01:21:17,920 --> 01:21:20,388
- Assad?
- I'm okay.

657
01:21:20,560 --> 01:21:22,551
- You need help.
- I'm okay.

658
01:21:22,720 --> 01:21:24,631
She's in there, dammit!

659
01:22:22,440 --> 01:22:24,670
PRESSURE CHAMBER

660
01:22:24,840 --> 01:22:27,195
She's alive.

661
01:22:27,360 --> 01:22:29,555
- Merete Lynggaard is alive.
<i>- What the hell... ?</i>

662
01:22:29,720 --> 01:22:31,711
Shut up and listen.

663
01:22:31,880 --> 01:22:34,314
She's alive.
She's trapped in some chamber.

664
01:22:34,480 --> 01:22:37,153
Krageholmvej 7, Lolland.
Send help.

665
01:22:37,320 --> 01:22:40,312
The navy. An ambulance.

666
01:23:31,840 --> 01:23:34,718
<i>Merete!</i>

667
01:23:35,640 --> 01:23:38,552
<i>Don't give up!</i>

668
01:23:38,720 --> 01:23:41,109
Merete!
Come on!

669
01:23:41,280 --> 01:23:44,511
<i>Listen to me.</i>
<i>You're not going to die.</i>

670
01:23:44,720 --> 01:23:46,199
<i>Come on!</i>

671
01:23:49,320 --> 01:23:51,470
Merete!

672
01:23:56,680 --> 01:23:58,716
You're not going to die.

673
01:26:29,360 --> 01:26:31,510
Thanks.

674
01:26:42,680 --> 01:26:45,513
It's worse than yours.

675
01:26:52,280 --> 01:26:54,555
Hi.

676
01:26:54,760 --> 01:26:57,911
She's reacting well
to the depressurizing.

677
01:26:58,040 --> 01:27:02,113
But she's very weak and marked
by the many years of captivity.

678
01:27:02,280 --> 01:27:05,750
- We don't know how bad...
- But she's going to make it?

679
01:27:05,920 --> 01:27:08,957
She's going to make it.

680
01:28:07,880 --> 01:28:12,396
I've put in a recommendation
for you to return to Homicide.

681
01:28:12,600 --> 01:28:14,955
No thanks.

682
01:28:16,240 --> 01:28:19,437
Hey, what do you want?

683
01:28:19,560 --> 01:28:22,154
- Department Q.
- Department Q?

684
01:28:22,320 --> 01:28:26,791
Yes. I decide which cases to take,
and how long I spend on them.

685
01:28:27,000 --> 01:28:29,116
Okay.

686
01:28:30,200 --> 01:28:32,953
- How many men...
- Assad and me.

687
01:28:33,120 --> 01:28:36,795
And a secretary
to handle the paperwork.

688
01:28:36,920 --> 01:28:38,194
Okay.

689
01:32:31,920 --> 01:32:34,115
