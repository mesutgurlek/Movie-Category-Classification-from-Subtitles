1
00:01:51,469 --> 00:01:53,494
<i>My dear children...</i>

2
00:01:53,604 --> 00:01:56,801
<i>...it is now better than several years...</i>

3
00:01:56,908 --> 00:01:59,069
<i>...since I moved to New York...</i>

4
00:01:59,177 --> 00:02:01,873
<i>...and I haven't seen you
as much as I would like to.</i>

5
00:02:03,481 --> 00:02:07,508
<i>I hope you will come
to this ceremony of papal honors...</i>

6
00:02:07,618 --> 00:02:09,518
<i>given for my charitable work.</i>

7
00:02:11,989 --> 00:02:15,425
<i>The only wealth in this world is children.</i>

8
00:02:15,526 --> 00:02:21,505
<i>More than all the money,
power on earth you are my treasure.</i>

9
00:02:23,701 --> 00:02:26,033
<i>Anthony and Mary...</i>

10
00:02:26,137 --> 00:02:30,969
<i>...although I entrusted your education to
your mother for your own best interests...</i>

11
00:02:31,042 --> 00:02:33,533
<i>...you know how I look forward to seeing you...</i>

12
00:02:33,644 --> 00:02:36,704
<i>...and to a new period of harmony in our lives.</i>

13
00:02:38,149 --> 00:02:43,119
<i>Perhaps you might prevail upon your mother
to come to this celebration...</i>

14
00:02:43,221 --> 00:02:45,746
<i>...and that from time to time...</i>

15
00:02:45,857 --> 00:02:49,657
<i>...we can all see each other at family functions.</i>

16
00:02:49,761 --> 00:02:54,425
<i>Anyway, I remain, your loving father.</i>

17
00:03:24,095 --> 00:03:26,325
Hail Mary, full of grace...

18
00:03:30,201 --> 00:03:32,192
...blessed art thou amongst women...

19
00:03:33,571 --> 00:03:37,667
...and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus.

20
00:03:37,775 --> 00:03:43,078
Holy Mary, mother of god
pray for us sinners...

21
00:04:06,671 --> 00:04:10,298
...almighty god, bless the insignia...

22
00:04:10,311 --> 00:04:12,901
...of Saint Sebastian the martyr.

23
00:04:12,910 --> 00:04:17,310
That it may contribute to the sacredness of him...

24
00:04:17,415 --> 00:04:19,349
...to whom it is given.

25
00:04:31,762 --> 00:04:33,662
Do you, Michael...

26
00:04:33,764 --> 00:04:38,992
...promise to be faithful to the noble purposes of this order...

27
00:04:39,036 --> 00:04:44,064
...to have a special care for the poor,
the needy and those who are ill?

28
00:04:44,141 --> 00:04:45,938
I do so promise.

29
00:05:00,925 --> 00:05:04,292
May the blessing of almighty god...

30
00:05:04,395 --> 00:05:09,355
...father, son, and holy spirit...

31
00:05:09,467 --> 00:05:15,001
...descend upon you and remain with you forever.

32
00:05:15,006 --> 00:05:16,633
Amen.

33
00:06:48,466 --> 00:06:51,824
Vincent, our name's not on the list.

34
00:06:53,571 --> 00:06:54,868
Write it in.

35
00:06:54,972 --> 00:06:57,463
Mancini. M-A-N-C-I-N-I.

36
00:06:59,243 --> 00:07:01,971
- Hey, is there a problem here?
- No problem, our name's not on the list.

37
00:07:01,979 --> 00:07:04,413
Hey, you're not on the list, you'll have to leave immediately.

38
00:07:04,515 --> 00:07:06,813
- There's no two ways about it!
- You want to dance with me sir?

39
00:07:06,917 --> 00:07:09,913
Joe! Joe! It's Vinnie.
Vinnie, it's Okay, these are our guests.

40
00:07:10,454 --> 00:07:11,853
Sorry Dave.

41
00:07:11,956 --> 00:07:14,857
- It's all right.
- Hey Vinnie. Welcome to the party.

42
00:08:07,778 --> 00:08:09,177
It's good to see you.

43
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:12,147
It's good to see you again.
This is my husband.

44
00:08:12,249 --> 00:08:14,149
This is my son, Anthony.

45
00:08:15,252 --> 00:08:18,153
The order of Saint Sebastian
is one of the highest honors...

46
00:08:18,255 --> 00:08:20,390
...the Catholic Church can bestow upon a layman.

47
00:08:20,391 --> 00:08:23,189
The award was first granted by Pope Gregory...

48
00:08:23,294 --> 00:08:26,229
What about Mr. Corleone's connections
with las Vegas gambling?

49
00:08:26,330 --> 00:08:28,762
Press kits have pictures of...

50
00:08:28,766 --> 00:08:30,927
What about his involvements with the underworld?

51
00:08:31,035 --> 00:08:32,502
Hey, cut the crap, huh?

52
00:08:32,603 --> 00:08:35,868
The Pope, the holy father himself...

53
00:08:35,973 --> 00:08:40,679
...has this very day blessed Michael Corleone.
You think you know better than the Pope?

54
00:08:40,778 --> 00:08:42,678
- Do it, do it.
- Vincent!

55
00:08:42,780 --> 00:08:45,180
- Yes?
- She loves you.

56
00:08:50,287 --> 00:08:51,777
- What'd he say?
- I love you too.

57
00:08:57,895 --> 00:09:01,422
Hi, Vincent.
I remember you.

58
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:04,124
You remember me?
From where?

59
00:09:04,235 --> 00:09:08,645
- From the last time we had a party together.
- Did you come down to the club?

60
00:09:08,739 --> 00:09:11,230
- No, it was a wedding.
- A wedding?

61
00:09:12,343 --> 00:09:15,835
I was eight, and you were 15.

62
00:09:15,946 --> 00:09:18,972
Well I, I had a lot of girlfriends when I was 15.

63
00:09:19,083 --> 00:09:21,578
- Eight-year-olds?
- Especially eight-year-olds.

64
00:09:23,420 --> 00:09:25,547
Where's Mary?

65
00:09:25,656 --> 00:09:28,056
Would somebody please hail Mary?

66
00:09:28,159 --> 00:09:30,354
Excuse me, your excellency.

67
00:09:30,461 --> 00:09:33,496
You know, you haven't kissed me hello yet.

68
00:09:33,497 --> 00:09:36,825
- Relatives always kiss.
- Oh, now we're related?

69
00:09:36,834 --> 00:09:39,259
I'm your little cousin.

70
00:09:46,277 --> 00:09:48,006
Who's your father?

71
00:09:48,112 --> 00:09:50,808
I'll give you a hint.

72
00:09:50,915 --> 00:09:53,440
- He's Italian.
- Mary.

73
00:09:53,551 --> 00:09:56,418
Mary, we've been waiting for you.

74
00:09:56,520 --> 00:10:00,513
Remember - remember now, keep your voice low, right?

75
00:10:00,624 --> 00:10:03,149
And smile! Don't forget to smile.

76
00:10:20,878 --> 00:10:24,809
Carissimi Amici, the honorary chairman...

77
00:10:24,815 --> 00:10:29,879
...of the Vito Corleone Foundation, my daughter, Mary Corleone.

78
00:10:39,563 --> 00:10:40,830
Thanks.

79
00:10:42,199 --> 00:10:47,675
I don't think I inherited my father's
love for speech making, but here it goes.

80
00:10:48,839 --> 00:10:53,439
The Vito Corleone Foundation helps
the impoverished of every country,...

81
00:10:53,544 --> 00:10:58,344
...gives grants to artists, funds medical research,...

82
00:10:58,449 --> 00:11:03,182
...and is particularly dedicated
to the resurrection of Sicily.

83
00:11:03,287 --> 00:11:05,619
ArchBishop Gilday...

84
00:11:05,723 --> 00:11:10,160
...here is $100 million for the poor of Sicily...

85
00:11:10,261 --> 00:11:12,456
...in the name of Vito Corleone.

86
00:11:12,563 --> 00:11:15,361
Don't spend it all in one place.

87
00:11:36,954 --> 00:11:39,081
Mary - Mary, I'm so proud of you.

88
00:11:45,164 --> 00:11:50,700
- Michael, you've done a wonderful thing for Sicily.
- ...a special surprise from Las Vegas;...

89
00:11:50,701 --> 00:11:54,728
Well, let's just hope the money gets to the people who need it.

90
00:11:54,838 --> 00:11:58,604
<i>- Amen.
- ...the most important part,...</i>

91
00:11:58,709 --> 00:12:00,943
<i>Johnny Fontane!</i>

92
00:12:09,586 --> 00:12:11,349
Thank you very much.

93
00:12:11,455 --> 00:12:14,356
I'm happy to be here with you,
and I'd like you to join me...

94
00:12:14,458 --> 00:12:18,387
<i>...in honoring commendatore Michael Corleone.</i>

95
00:12:22,533 --> 00:12:25,934
And I have something special for our host and Godfather:

96
00:12:26,036 --> 00:12:28,561
I just happen to know his favorite song.

97
00:12:28,672 --> 00:12:30,606
Michael, where are you going?
It's your favorite song.

98
00:12:30,708 --> 00:12:34,144
I'm off here to the kitchen
to hear some Tony Bennett records.

99
00:12:35,879 --> 00:12:38,211
<i>It's your favorite song.
It's "Sausage" His Own.</i>

100
00:12:38,315 --> 00:12:40,146
<i>That's right; a Sausage Sandwich!</i>

101
00:12:40,250 --> 00:12:41,683
I'll be back.

102
00:12:46,023 --> 00:12:48,924
<i>A rose must remain</i>

103
00:12:49,026 --> 00:12:51,586
<i>with the sun and the rain</i>

104
00:12:51,695 --> 00:12:56,496
<i>or its lovely promise won't come true</i>

105
00:12:57,668 --> 00:13:00,432
<i>to each his own</i>

106
00:13:00,537 --> 00:13:04,667
<i>to each his own</i>

107
00:13:04,775 --> 00:13:08,370
<i>and my own is you</i>

108
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:18,145
Hello, Kay.

109
00:13:27,965 --> 00:13:31,059
Well congratulations, Michael, that's really quite an honor.

110
00:13:31,168 --> 00:13:34,103
It's a little expensive, wouldn't you say?

111
00:13:36,774 --> 00:13:38,708
Cake?

112
00:13:38,809 --> 00:13:40,470
No, thank you.

113
00:13:54,124 --> 00:13:57,025
- It's been a long time, hasn't it?
- Uh huh. Yeah.

114
00:13:57,127 --> 00:13:59,527
- Eight years.
- Yeah.

115
00:13:59,630 --> 00:14:01,530
You look wonderful.

116
00:14:05,302 --> 00:14:07,668
Your son has something
he wants to talk to you about.

117
00:14:07,771 --> 00:14:10,103
I came here for him.

118
00:14:12,576 --> 00:14:14,476
Nice to see you.
Thank you.

119
00:14:18,882 --> 00:14:21,715
<i>If a flame is to grow</i>

120
00:14:21,819 --> 00:14:25,186

121
00:14:25,289 --> 00:14:27,883

00:14:27,991 --> 00:14:30,721

00:14:33,797 --> 00:14:36,425
<i>I can't let you go</i>

125
00:14:44,374 --> 00:14:47,434
- What's wrong with being a lawyer?
- Nothing, except he doesn't want it.

126
00:14:47,544 --> 00:14:50,445
He loves music, he wants his life to be in music.

127
00:14:51,815 --> 00:14:54,215
Well, music is great. I love music.

128
00:14:54,318 --> 00:14:56,718
But he should finish what he started.

129
00:14:58,088 --> 00:15:01,421
- I'm going my own way.
- Your own way?

130
00:15:01,525 --> 00:15:03,152
- Professional singer?
- That's right.

131
00:15:03,260 --> 00:15:06,696
And what happens -- what happens if you fail?

132
00:15:06,797 --> 00:15:08,731
I won't fail.

133
00:15:08,832 --> 00:15:11,164
- Men always believe that.
- I know.

134
00:15:11,268 --> 00:15:15,178
If you have a law degree you're taking out insurance.

135
00:15:15,272 --> 00:15:17,397
After that you can do whatever you want.
You can work for me...

136
00:15:17,407 --> 00:15:21,602
I will never work for you. I have bad memories.

137
00:15:23,981 --> 00:15:26,609
Every family has bad memories.

138
00:15:30,420 --> 00:15:32,513
I will always be your son...

139
00:15:32,623 --> 00:15:37,185
...but I will never have anything
to do with your business.

140
00:15:37,294 --> 00:15:43,282
- Anthony, finish the law degree.
- No.

141
00:16:00,817 --> 00:16:05,151
Well, that he got from you. That "no".

142
00:16:07,958 --> 00:16:13,165
- You could have helped me to convince him, Kay.
- Oh, convince him of what?

143
00:16:13,263 --> 00:16:15,731
Of what?

144
00:16:15,832 --> 00:16:20,696
He throws his life away.
He throws greatness away.

145
00:16:21,738 --> 00:16:24,707
This is greatness?

146
00:16:24,808 --> 00:16:26,808
You know Michael, now that you're so respectable...

147
00:16:26,810 --> 00:16:29,176
...I think you're more dangerous than you ever were.

148
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:33,687
In fact, I preferred you when you were just a common Mafia hood.

149
00:16:34,554 --> 00:16:40,521
- Kay, now can we talk common sense here?
- All right. - Okay.

150
00:16:47,331 --> 00:16:50,300
Tony knows that you killed Fredo.

151
00:16:56,573 --> 00:16:59,940
- What did you come here for?
- I came here to protect my son.

152
00:17:00,043 --> 00:17:02,637
I didn't come here to see you disguised by your church.

153
00:17:02,746 --> 00:17:05,146
I think that was a shameful ceremony.

154
00:17:09,419 --> 00:17:12,217
I spent my life protecting my son.

155
00:17:12,322 --> 00:17:16,524
I spent my life protecting my family!

156
00:17:16,526 --> 00:17:19,227
Let's be reasonable, Okay?

157
00:17:19,329 --> 00:17:23,129
That's your big thing, isn't it, Michael?

158
00:17:23,233 --> 00:17:27,397
Reason backed up by murder.

159
00:17:27,504 --> 00:17:29,165
Oh, God.

160
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:35,870
- God, you hate me. You hate me.
- No, I don't hate you.

161
00:17:37,114 --> 00:17:38,513
I dread you.

162
00:17:42,919 --> 00:17:46,355
I did what I could, Kay, to protect...

163
00:17:46,456 --> 00:17:49,518
...all of you from the horrors of this world.

164
00:17:50,527 --> 00:17:52,427
But you became my horror.

165
00:18:02,205 --> 00:18:04,537
The children still love you though.

166
00:18:04,641 --> 00:18:06,336
Especially Mary.

167
00:18:09,046 --> 00:18:10,604
That's something.

168
00:18:13,150 --> 00:18:16,984
We can build on that, for their sake.

169
00:18:20,757 --> 00:18:22,384
Let's try.

170
00:18:22,492 --> 00:18:25,723
Only if you let Tony go free to have his own life.

171
00:18:26,830 --> 00:18:28,156
Away from you.

172
00:18:35,205 --> 00:18:37,105
I'll let Tony go.

173
00:18:39,609 --> 00:18:41,236
Thank you.

174
00:19:19,816 --> 00:19:21,750
You could hurt somebody with those.

175
00:19:23,153 --> 00:19:25,121
You've been working too hard, let me show you around.

176
00:19:25,222 --> 00:19:27,588
Can you get me an interview
with Michael Corleone?

177
00:19:27,691 --> 00:19:30,558
Uh, no. I'm a relative but I can't do that.

178
00:19:30,660 --> 00:19:33,288
What else could I do for you?

179
00:19:33,397 --> 00:19:35,991
- Handsome but useless.
- Oh, yeah?

180
00:19:36,099 --> 00:19:39,296
- That's okay. I'll gamble.
- You like to gamble?

181
00:19:39,403 --> 00:19:43,430
Why don't we go to Atlantic City?
My town. I'll show you how to gamble.

182
00:19:43,540 --> 00:19:46,106
Yeah, but I like to win.
How will I know what numbers to pick?

183
00:19:46,109 --> 00:19:47,972
Do I look okay like a guy who's gonna lose?

184
00:19:47,978 --> 00:19:49,368
Well...

185
00:19:51,782 --> 00:19:54,216
...that's a spooky-looking guy there.

186
00:19:54,317 --> 00:19:57,844
What's a guy like that doing
at Michael Corleone's house?

187
00:19:57,954 --> 00:20:00,786
- That's Joey Zasa's bulldog.
- You know that guy?

188
00:20:00,790 --> 00:20:02,517
Yeah, I know that guy.

189
00:20:02,626 --> 00:20:05,527
That guy's name is Anthony Squigliaro.

190
00:20:05,629 --> 00:20:07,563
They call him "The Ant."

191
00:20:07,664 --> 00:20:10,997
He dips his bullets in Cyanide.

192
00:20:19,142 --> 00:20:20,905
Don Altobello.

193
00:20:22,546 --> 00:20:26,346
- I come to pay my respects.
- Grazie.

194
00:20:29,453 --> 00:20:31,887
You honor my family's friendship.

195
00:20:31,988 --> 00:20:37,949
- Where is my goddaughter? Constanzia...
- Don Altobello...

196
00:20:38,829 --> 00:20:44,095
It was not so long ago
I held you in these old hands.

197
00:20:46,096 --> 00:20:47,096
Michael...

198
00:20:48,572 --> 00:20:51,200
No, no.
I stand. I stand.

199
00:20:51,308 --> 00:20:56,744
Michael, I lost all the venom all the juice of youth.

200
00:20:56,847 --> 00:21:02,482
I lost the lust for women and now my mind is clear.

201
00:21:02,586 --> 00:21:05,487
My duty to God is clear.

202
00:21:05,589 --> 00:21:08,990
I - I have a special favor to ask.

203
00:21:10,660 --> 00:21:14,892
Can I attach my name...

204
00:21:14,998 --> 00:21:20,799
...to the Vito Corleone Foundation
so that you and I can be joined...

205
00:21:20,837 --> 00:21:23,533
...in name and spirit?

206
00:21:25,876 --> 00:21:27,571
One million dollars.

207
00:21:33,717 --> 00:21:38,151
- Godfather.
- Don Altobello, you have such a heart.

208
00:21:40,657 --> 00:21:44,285
Come, let's go and sample some of Italy, old vino.

209
00:21:51,501 --> 00:21:54,993
The Vatican knows nothing of these shareholders.

210
00:21:55,105 --> 00:21:58,506
Good.
I have a tendency to worry.

211
00:21:58,608 --> 00:22:02,666
We've increased our position
substantially and naturally, I worry.

212
00:22:02,779 --> 00:22:04,406
Come along now.
Stop worrying.

213
00:22:04,514 --> 00:22:06,914
We have an agreement.

214
00:22:07,017 --> 00:22:09,679
Good. How do you think I got this grey hair?

215
00:22:09,786 --> 00:22:11,083
Mr. Corleone.

216
00:22:11,187 --> 00:22:13,246
- Two seconds.
- Frank, how are you?

217
00:22:13,356 --> 00:22:15,847
Thank you very much for your
contribution to the Board's swimming pool,...

218
00:22:15,959 --> 00:22:20,191
...and we need your help on
Sam Wallace's candidacy for judgeship.

219
00:22:20,297 --> 00:22:22,527
- We always can use a good judge.
- Thank you.

220
00:22:22,632 --> 00:22:24,497
Andrew.

221
00:22:24,601 --> 00:22:28,933
Your Excellency, my Godson, Andrew Hagan
my brother Tom Hagen's eldest boy

222
00:22:29,039 --> 00:22:32,440
He's been assistant
to Bishop Breelan three years now.

223
00:22:32,542 --> 00:22:34,874
Hoping for an assignment to the Vatican.

224
00:22:34,978 --> 00:22:37,572
There's always a place in Rome
for a fine young priest.

225
00:22:37,681 --> 00:22:40,315
His mother, Theresa Hagen. Archbishop Gilday.

226
00:22:40,316 --> 00:22:42,878
Thank you.
It's an honor to meet you.

227
00:22:42,986 --> 00:22:47,446
Mr. Corleone, hi.
Grace Hamilton.

228
00:22:47,557 --> 00:22:52,395
Vincent Mancini promised that he'd tell
you about me, that maybe you'd see me.

229
00:22:52,495 --> 00:22:54,258
Vincent Mancini called about her?

230
00:22:54,364 --> 00:22:55,763
No.

231
00:22:55,865 --> 00:22:58,597
Grace, you promised me you'd stay up there.

232
00:22:58,601 --> 00:23:00,566
- I know. I know.
- Twice.

233
00:23:01,171 --> 00:23:05,005
Joey Zasa showed up.
We've got him waiting in the lobby.

234
00:23:05,108 --> 00:23:09,135
Says he wants to personally
congratulate you and show his respect.

235
00:23:09,245 --> 00:23:11,179
Do I have to see him?

236
00:23:11,281 --> 00:23:14,478
<i>He says you're his padrone
and he only wants a minute.</i>

237
00:23:18,021 --> 00:23:20,751
Hey, Vinnie.

238
00:23:20,857 --> 00:23:23,018
- Who's your favorite Aunt?
- You are.

239
00:23:26,129 --> 00:23:30,293
Today I'm going to talk to Michael
about your problem.

240
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:33,130
I wish you would have warned me, Con.
I could have worn a better suit.

241
00:23:35,138 --> 00:23:41,164
The Meucci Association has elected you,
their Italian-American Man of the Year.

242
00:23:42,145 --> 00:23:43,942
Hey, Meucci.

243
00:23:46,950 --> 00:23:48,440
Who's Meucci?

244
00:23:49,819 --> 00:23:52,185
He's the Italian-American
who invented the telephone.

245
00:23:52,288 --> 00:23:55,689
He did it one year before
Alexander Graham Bell.

246
00:23:55,792 --> 00:23:57,726
Really? Huh.

247
00:23:59,763 --> 00:24:02,732
And this is the reason you've come to my home on this day?

248
00:24:09,733 --> 00:24:11,033
I umm,...

249
00:24:13,810 --> 00:24:17,004
...got a stone in my shoe, Mr. Corleone.

250
00:24:18,048 --> 00:24:21,142
A two-bit punk who works for me.

251
00:24:21,251 --> 00:24:25,444
The one who, thinks he's related to you.

252
00:24:27,257 --> 00:24:29,157
A bastard.

253
00:24:32,495 --> 00:24:35,623
He's here.
Vincent Mancini.

254
00:24:35,732 --> 00:24:37,063
He's at the party.

255
00:24:40,236 --> 00:24:42,101
Well bring him in.

256
00:24:43,373 --> 00:24:46,740
I think it's good we talk.

257
00:24:50,613 --> 00:24:52,945
I have a problem...

258
00:24:53,049 --> 00:24:57,213
...and I want to find out if it is my problem...

259
00:24:57,320 --> 00:24:59,447
...or your problem.

260
00:24:59,556 --> 00:25:01,490
Joe, your business is your business.

261
00:25:01,591 --> 00:25:03,923
I have no interest or percentages.

262
00:25:04,027 --> 00:25:05,187
I'm out.

263
00:25:05,295 --> 00:25:07,991
Good.

264
00:25:08,098 --> 00:25:09,998
Then it's my problem.

265
00:25:13,436 --> 00:25:17,900
Michael, you know Vincent Mancini, Sonny's boy.

266
00:25:20,009 --> 00:25:22,068
How you doing, Mr. Corleone?

267
00:25:22,178 --> 00:25:24,373
- How you doing?
- I'm doin' good. How you doin'?

268
00:25:24,481 --> 00:25:26,039
- Good.
- Good party.

269
00:25:26,149 --> 00:25:28,242
- Oh, you like it.
- Yeah. I had to sneak in.

270
00:25:28,351 --> 00:25:30,251
Well, you're dressed for it.

271
00:25:34,791 --> 00:25:39,183
So, what's the trouble between you and Mr. Joe Zasa?

272
00:25:41,097 --> 00:25:42,997
There's trouble. I'll take care of it.

273
00:25:43,099 --> 00:25:47,195
- That's foolish of you.
- Foolish of me?

274
00:25:47,303 --> 00:25:49,464
It's a little foolish of this guy, don't you think?

275
00:25:49,572 --> 00:25:51,802
Right?

276
00:25:51,908 --> 00:25:53,842
Right?

277
00:25:53,943 --> 00:25:55,968
Temper like his father.

278
00:25:56,079 --> 00:26:01,947
Vincent. Mr. Joe Zasa now owns what used to be...

279
00:26:01,951 --> 00:26:04,715
...the Corleone family business in New York.

280
00:26:04,721 --> 00:26:08,953
Out of the kindness of his heart,
he gave you a job in his family.

281
00:26:09,058 --> 00:26:11,925
Contrary to my advice, you took the job.

282
00:26:12,028 --> 00:26:15,623
I offered you something better
in the legitimate world.

283
00:26:15,732 --> 00:26:17,131
You turned me down.

284
00:26:17,233 --> 00:26:21,033
Now you both come to me with this bad blood.

285
00:26:21,137 --> 00:26:25,666
And what do you expect me to do?
Am I a gangster?

286
00:26:25,675 --> 00:26:27,809
- No. You're not a gangster.
- That was papa's neighborhood.

287
00:26:27,811 --> 00:26:30,678
Now it's a sewer.
Zasa runs it like a disgrace that's...

288
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:32,213
- ...what the women tell me.
- That's the past Connie.

289
00:26:32,315 --> 00:26:34,510
I earned that territory with my talent.

290
00:26:34,617 --> 00:26:38,519
The commission gave it to me,
and you approved it.

291
00:26:38,621 --> 00:26:41,582
- Yes.
- Uncle Michael, I came to the party here.

292
00:26:41,592 --> 00:26:44,393
I'm not here to ask for any kind of help.
I could just kill this bastard,...

293
00:26:44,394 --> 00:26:47,227
- ...he's the one who needs the help.
- So kill him.

294
00:26:47,330 --> 00:26:50,788
What has all this have to do with me?

295
00:26:50,900 --> 00:26:54,160
Well, he's going around behind your back
saying fuck Michael Corleone all the time.

296
00:26:54,170 --> 00:26:56,231
That's it, see, that's one thing it has to do with you.
Right?

297
00:26:56,339 --> 00:26:59,164
Say it to his face,
one time say it to his face, one time!

298
00:27:00,577 --> 00:27:03,636
Mr. Corleone, all bastards are liars.

299
00:27:03,646 --> 00:27:07,076
- Shakespeare wrote poems about it.
- What am I gonna do with this guy?

300
00:27:07,077 --> 00:27:08,277
What am I gonna do with this guy?

301
00:27:14,677 --> 00:27:15,977
Joey.

302
00:27:16,860 --> 00:27:22,295
If there's some guy running around
this city saying "fuck Michael Corleone",...

303
00:27:22,365 --> 00:27:26,893
...what do we do, with a piece of shit like that?

304
00:27:29,539 --> 00:27:31,029
He's a fucking dog?

305
00:27:34,030 --> 00:27:35,030
No.

306
00:27:38,715 --> 00:27:42,116
Yes, it's true.
If anyone would say such a thing...

307
00:27:42,218 --> 00:27:45,813
...they would not be a friend, they would be a dog.

308
00:27:51,928 --> 00:27:54,360
My interests don't confiict with Mr. Joe Zasa's.

309
00:27:54,364 --> 00:27:58,198
Oh you don't know how much your interests
conflict with Mr. Joe Zasa's, Uncle Michael.

310
00:27:58,301 --> 00:28:01,998
Wait.
He needs your support, Michael.

311
00:28:02,105 --> 00:28:05,674
- Don't let me work for this guy no more Uncle Michael,
let me come work for you.                   - For me?

312
00:28:05,675 --> 00:28:07,704
- Yeah.
- As what? Tough guy?

313
00:28:07,810 --> 00:28:09,710
I don't need tough guys.

314
00:28:09,812 --> 00:28:11,746
I need more lawyers.

315
00:28:14,250 --> 00:28:17,048
Since we have no confiicts, no debts...

316
00:28:17,153 --> 00:28:19,118
...I accept your tribute.

317
00:28:19,122 --> 00:28:20,714
I wish you well.

318
00:28:22,292 --> 00:28:25,659
Vincent, make your peace with Mr. Joe Zasa.

319
00:28:25,762 --> 00:28:27,161
Come on.

320
00:28:30,099 --> 00:28:31,794
Okay. Go on.

321
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:40,165
<i>Bastardo.</i>

322
00:28:44,948 --> 00:28:47,439
For Christ's sakes, stop!
What the hell is the matter with you?

323
00:28:47,550 --> 00:28:49,047
Get him out of here.

324
00:28:51,587 --> 00:28:53,987
Oh, Jesus.

325
00:28:54,090 --> 00:28:56,820
Uncle Michael, I told Connie it
wasn't the right time for this thing -

326
00:28:56,926 --> 00:28:59,689
- Close it.    - Uncle Michael, listen,
I know you're into banks and Wall Street,...

327
00:28:59,696 --> 00:29:01,958
...but everyone knows you're the final word,
you're like the Supreme Court.

328
00:29:01,966 --> 00:29:04,997
All I want to do is protect you from these
guys and your lawyers can't do that.

329
00:29:05,001 --> 00:29:06,892
- And you can?
- Yeah, I can do that.

330
00:29:09,372 --> 00:29:11,306
And why should I be afraid of Joe Zasa?

331
00:29:11,407 --> 00:29:14,604
Well, he knows you're stopping him from
rising up in the commission, Uncle Mike.

332
00:29:14,711 --> 00:29:17,805
I say we make him dead.
You give me the order, I'll take care of it.

333
00:29:17,914 --> 00:29:20,144
- You'll take care of it?
- Yeah.

334
00:29:24,487 --> 00:29:29,497
Maybe you should, uhh, come with
me for a few weeks. See what happens.

335
00:29:29,593 --> 00:29:32,527
- Okay.
- See if you learn.

336
00:29:33,296 --> 00:29:36,863
And, umm, we'll talk about your future.

337
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:39,700
I won't let you down.

338
00:29:46,009 --> 00:29:51,909
- We're just about ready.
- No, it's all right.

339
00:29:54,217 --> 00:29:56,685
- So what happened?
- What happened?

340
00:29:56,786 --> 00:29:59,914
They put me in a room with Joey Zasa,
what's gonna happen? I bit the guy's ear off.

341
00:29:59,922 --> 00:30:02,958
Here we go.
Watch the card.

342
00:30:03,059 --> 00:30:05,819
- There.
- Hold it.

343
00:30:05,828 --> 00:30:08,526
I'll just change the plate here.

344
00:30:08,631 --> 00:30:10,656
- Vincent.
- Yeah?

345
00:30:10,767 --> 00:30:13,463
Take the picture with me.
Come on.

346
00:30:20,309 --> 00:30:23,437
- Nice jacket.
- Little girl...

347
00:30:23,546 --> 00:30:26,515
...closer to the center, if you would, sir.

348
00:30:26,616 --> 00:30:28,345
And here we go.

349
00:30:28,451 --> 00:30:31,511
Ready. Smile.

350
00:30:31,621 --> 00:30:34,181
Excellent.
I'll have it for you on monday.

351
00:30:48,971 --> 00:30:50,370
- Butter cake.
- Beautiful.

352
00:30:50,473 --> 00:30:56,435
Godfather, this is the cake for you
and your family, from Enzo the baker.

353
00:30:56,512 --> 00:30:58,537
You want to do it?
All right...

354
00:31:38,087 --> 00:31:39,520
You lead.

355
00:31:41,257 --> 00:31:43,122
Kathryn, you lead.

356
00:32:47,256 --> 00:32:50,419
- Vincent?
- What do you want, sweetheart?

357
00:32:52,495 --> 00:32:54,395
Do you love me?

358
00:32:55,631 --> 00:32:58,225
- Come on. Go to bed.
- Come on. Say it.

359
00:32:58,334 --> 00:33:00,131
- Come on. Go to bed.
- No. Say it.

360
00:33:00,236 --> 00:33:02,568
I love you.
I love you.

361
00:33:02,672 --> 00:33:04,503
I love you too.

362
00:33:07,176 --> 00:33:09,167
You got a cat?

363
00:33:15,618 --> 00:33:18,178
Go get us some water, would you?
I'm thirsty. Come on.

364
00:33:19,589 --> 00:33:21,147
Come on.

365
00:33:28,397 --> 00:33:31,094
Well, I just guess I know my place.

366
00:33:32,235 --> 00:33:35,636
I can't believe I'm actually getting up to do this.

367
00:33:35,738 --> 00:33:38,969
"Get me a glass of water, bake me a cake."
Whatever happened to "please"?

368
00:34:26,656 --> 00:34:27,588
Come on.

369
00:34:27,690 --> 00:34:30,488
Good boy, sockface.
Let's go for a walk.

370
00:34:38,968 --> 00:34:40,026
Hey. Come on, let her go.

371
00:34:40,136 --> 00:34:42,366
Fuck it.
Cut her fucking throat, man!

372
00:34:44,874 --> 00:34:47,274
- What'd you say?
- I said, cut her fucking throat.

373
00:34:50,546 --> 00:34:53,977
- Okay, chief, let her go.
- Drop your gun man, or he's gonna cut her throat.

374
00:34:54,050 --> 00:34:56,341
What are fucking crazy, I hardly know this broad.

375
00:34:56,352 --> 00:34:58,452
Go ahead and cut her.
What the fuck do I care?

376
00:35:00,489 --> 00:35:03,754
You got no choice, man.
This chick's gonna be dead.

377
00:35:03,859 --> 00:35:06,726
You hurt her and I'll kill you both.

378
00:35:06,829 --> 00:35:10,230
- You give up that knife, I'll let you go.
- You cut her throat man, right now!

379
00:35:11,068 --> 00:35:13,997
Hey! I'm gonna do something to convince you.
Don't get frightened.

380
00:35:14,003 --> 00:35:16,133
Don't do any sudden movements.
Just watch me, all right?

381
00:35:16,238 --> 00:35:17,830
- You hear what I said?
- Okay.

382
00:35:21,344 --> 00:35:23,771
Oh, shit!

383
00:35:25,581 --> 00:35:28,281
Drop the knife.
Go ahead. Drop it!

384
00:35:28,084 --> 00:35:30,075
Good boy.

385
00:35:30,186 --> 00:35:32,086
Sit down.
I want to talk to you.

386
00:35:32,188 --> 00:35:34,918
That was a wise choice, sit down.
I want to talk to you.

387
00:35:35,024 --> 00:35:37,015
Lose the mask.

388
00:35:39,862 --> 00:35:41,557
Relax. Have a smoke.
You smoke?

389
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:46,500
Whose idea was this?

390
00:35:46,602 --> 00:35:48,399
Who sent you?

391
00:35:48,504 --> 00:35:51,200
Come on. Tell me.
Who sent you?

392
00:35:53,376 --> 00:35:56,038
- No one.
- Take a good look at this guy?

393
00:35:56,145 --> 00:35:58,679
- Yeah.
- So who sent you?

394
00:36:01,350 --> 00:36:03,614
It was Joey.
Joey Zasa.

395
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:19,758
You okay?

396
00:36:23,005 --> 00:36:26,668
- You were going to let them kill me!
- No, I wasn't gonna let anything happen to you.

397
00:36:26,675 --> 00:36:29,171
You pig!
You sick fuck!

398
00:36:30,980 --> 00:36:35,356
Come on, sweetheart, that's gambling.
You wanted gambling? That's gambling. Call the police.

399
00:36:39,555 --> 00:36:43,548
- You killed the other guy too?
- He went for my gun.

400
00:36:43,659 --> 00:36:47,095
It's self-defense, justifiable homicide.
Go ahead. Call the police.

401
00:36:48,097 --> 00:36:50,290
- Where are you going? Oh no, no, no. No pictures.
- I'm going to take some pictures first.

402
00:36:50,299 --> 00:36:52,358
No pictures.

403
00:36:53,803 --> 00:36:57,244
<i>You had a gun.
They only had a knife.</i>

404
00:36:57,306 --> 00:37:00,400
You could have talked them into surrendering,
handed them over to the police.

405
00:37:00,509 --> 00:37:04,502
Zasa sent these guys.
I just sent him a message, that's all.

406
00:37:05,381 --> 00:37:08,973
- Now he has to send you a message back.
- Joey Zasa's gonna send me a message back?

407
00:37:08,984 --> 00:37:12,185
- Joey Zasa's gonna send a message!
- He did the right thing.

408
00:37:12,187 --> 00:37:15,718
- He got Zasa's name.
- What has Joey Zasa got to with anything?

409
00:37:15,724 --> 00:37:18,589
<i>Joey Zasa's a pazzo.
Joey Zasa.</i>

410
00:37:20,863 --> 00:37:23,798
All right, you are what you are.

411
00:37:23,899 --> 00:37:27,266
It's your nature.
You stay close to me.

412
00:37:27,369 --> 00:37:29,064
You don't do anything.

413
00:37:29,171 --> 00:37:31,162
You keep your mouth shut, and your eyes open.

414
00:37:31,273 --> 00:37:34,538
- And you do what I tell you. Understand?
- I understand.

415
00:37:34,643 --> 00:37:37,143
I got problems with the Commission, young man.

416
00:37:37,146 --> 00:37:39,976
- I know that.
- Yes. You don't make them easier.

417
00:37:39,982 --> 00:37:43,645
I understand that,
it wasn't my idea that this happened, you know?

418
00:37:43,752 --> 00:37:45,276
All right. Go on.
Get out of here.

419
00:37:45,277 --> 00:37:47,477
- Michael...
- Yes?

420
00:37:49,325 --> 00:37:51,384
Now they'll fear you.

421
00:37:51,494 --> 00:37:53,587
Maybe they should fear you.

422
00:37:57,166 --> 00:37:59,300
B.J., excuse me.
What's up?

423
00:37:59,301 --> 00:38:04,360
Michael, the Archbishop just called back.
He's arranged some amazing things for your bidding.

424
00:38:04,406 --> 00:38:08,396
The publicity is phenomenal.
You're the new Rockefeller of philanthropist.

425
00:38:10,646 --> 00:38:14,275
- Sign right here, please.
- Times do change, don't they?

426
00:38:14,383 --> 00:38:17,716
My father hated foundations.

427
00:38:17,820 --> 00:38:23,078
He loved doing it by himself, man to man.
But we're different, huh?

428
00:38:23,125 --> 00:38:26,060
It's no different than any large corporation.

429
00:38:26,161 --> 00:38:28,527
We control a lot of money with very little.

430
00:38:28,631 --> 00:38:33,041
Minimize taxes, with, no government control.

431
00:38:36,842 --> 00:38:41,002
Yes -- Right.

432
00:38:41,877 --> 00:38:43,572
Godfather?

433
00:38:43,679 --> 00:38:45,670
Andrew.

434
00:38:45,781 --> 00:38:48,648
- Godfather...
- Off to Rome.

435
00:38:48,751 --> 00:38:51,743
I wanted to thank you for all you've done for me.

436
00:38:51,854 --> 00:38:55,187
- Come on, you want to have some breakfast with us?
- No, thanks. I can't.

437
00:38:55,291 --> 00:38:57,191
All right. How's your Italian.

438
00:38:57,192 --> 00:38:58,692
In fare di podi practico...

439
00:39:00,362 --> 00:39:02,896
- His father was a great lawyer.
- I know.

440
00:39:02,898 --> 00:39:05,298
Didn't live to see him ordained.
I did.

441
00:39:05,401 --> 00:39:07,362
- You ever seen one of those?
- No.

442
00:39:07,370 --> 00:39:10,730
Oh, beautiful. I was so proud.
Come on let me walk you out.

443
00:39:12,508 --> 00:39:15,304
Andrew, if you hear any rumors fiying
around the Vatican you let me know?

444
00:39:15,311 --> 00:39:17,905
Oh no, no. Andrew has the true faith.

445
00:39:27,523 --> 00:39:31,588
<i>Don Corleone. I need your help.</i>

446
00:39:31,627 --> 00:39:35,085
And not just to light a little candle.

447
00:39:35,197 --> 00:39:39,691
My, gift, was to be able to persuade people,...

448
00:39:39,802 --> 00:39:43,067
...to give, to the Holy Church.

449
00:39:43,172 --> 00:39:47,997
Then, Rome decides,
to put me in charge of the Vatican bank.

450
00:39:50,045 --> 00:39:52,673
But I was never a true banker.

451
00:39:55,853 --> 00:40:00,185
Mais á culpa, I trusted my friends.

452
00:40:01,290 --> 00:40:06,208
Friendship and money - oil and water...

453
00:40:06,295 --> 00:40:08,286
Indeed.

454
00:40:08,397 --> 00:40:13,716
But these, friends, use the good name of the Church,...

455
00:40:13,802 --> 00:40:15,796
...to feed their greed.

456
00:40:16,505 --> 00:40:22,013
If money was lost, then I am to blame.

457
00:40:23,679 --> 00:40:29,307
Oh, if only prayer could, pay off our $700 million deficit.

458
00:40:30,919 --> 00:40:33,615
769 million.

459
00:40:39,228 --> 00:40:44,730
The church owns 25%
of a large corporation... Immobiliare.

460
00:40:45,467 --> 00:40:47,594
You know the one I mean.

461
00:40:47,703 --> 00:40:52,169
Largest landlord on earth, real estate
all over the world worth $6 billion.

462
00:40:54,843 --> 00:41:00,834
- That's true.
- And the Vatican vote is necessary for control.

463
00:41:03,485 --> 00:41:06,648
No. No, no.
You're mistaken.

464
00:41:06,755 --> 00:41:11,183
This isn't a question of one person deciding,
one deciding vote.

465
00:41:11,260 --> 00:41:13,555
This is like any other company in the world.

466
00:41:13,562 --> 00:41:17,354
We have directors. We have rules.
We have very old rules.

467
00:41:18,167 --> 00:41:22,501
The Pope himself would have to approve you.

468
00:41:27,142 --> 00:41:28,871
We've sold the casinos...

469
00:41:30,813 --> 00:41:33,714
...all businesses having to do with gambling.

470
00:41:34,817 --> 00:41:40,554
We have no interests,
or investments, in anything illegitimate.

471
00:41:43,559 --> 00:41:48,394
The Corleone's are prepared to deposit
$500 million in the Vatican bank...

472
00:41:48,397 --> 00:41:51,896
...at such time as Mr. Corleone receives
majority control of Immobiliare.

473
00:41:51,900 --> 00:41:54,698
Immobiliare could be something new...

474
00:41:54,803 --> 00:41:58,261
...a European conglomerate.

475
00:41:58,373 --> 00:42:02,739
Few families have control of such a company.

476
00:42:05,948 --> 00:42:08,781
It seems in today's world...

477
00:42:08,884 --> 00:42:13,275
...the power to absolve debt is greater than,
the power of forgiveness.

478
00:42:15,491 --> 00:42:17,391
$600 million.

479
00:42:22,297 --> 00:42:26,063
Don't overestimate the power of forgiveness.

480
00:42:27,703 --> 00:42:31,730
Don Corleone. This deal with Immobiliare...

481
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:34,707
...can make you one of the richest men in the world.

482
00:42:34,810 --> 00:42:40,407
Your whole past history, and the history
of your family, will be washed away.

483
00:42:44,520 --> 00:42:46,181
600 million.

484
00:43:02,137 --> 00:43:07,171
<i>[Keinszig] The motion and a discussion
relates to the Corleone group's proposal,...</i>

485
00:43:07,242 --> 00:43:12,308
<i>...to acquire 100 million newly issued,
Class A, quoted shares...</i>

486
00:43:13,749 --> 00:43:15,683
<i>Once issued, the shares will permit...</i>

487
00:43:15,784 --> 00:43:21,484
<i>[B.J. Harrison] ...$600 million and Corleone capital
invested directly into International Immobiliare,...</i>

488
00:43:21,523 --> 00:43:25,619
<i>...an old and respected European company...</i>

489
00:43:25,727 --> 00:43:31,205
<i>...that Michael Corleone has an ambitious program
to expand this real estate holding company,...</i>

490
00:43:31,300 --> 00:43:35,029
<i>...into an international conglomerate
that could meet the challenge...</i>

491
00:43:35,037 --> 00:43:40,034
<i>...not by political ideologies, but by
Eastern techniques of efficiency,...</i>

492
00:43:40,039 --> 00:43:42,968
- ...Mr. Corleone!
- ...and focus, and unlimited...

493
00:43:43,078 --> 00:43:45,376
Mr. Corleone, excuse me.

494
00:43:45,480 --> 00:43:49,648
Isn't it true that you recently deposited
$200 million in the Vatican bank...

495
00:43:49,651 --> 00:43:52,477
...which is affiliated with International Immobiliare?

496
00:43:52,588 --> 00:43:55,686
- This is true. Why not?
- Well, wasn't there any questioning...

497
00:43:55,690 --> 00:44:00,931
...about the timing on, on this particular deposit,
or wasn't there some talk...

498
00:44:00,929 --> 00:44:03,229
- Mr. Chairman, if I may?
- ...about the, the fact that...

499
00:44:04,700 --> 00:44:09,332
The Vito Andolini Corleone Foundation,
of which Mr. Corleone's daughter Mary is chairman,...

500
00:44:09,338 --> 00:44:12,739
...has established an endowment
in the amount of $100 million.

501
00:44:12,841 --> 00:44:17,271
The money comes from his own family
and will be administered by the Vatican.

502
00:44:17,346 --> 00:44:18,836
Answer your question?

503
00:44:20,048 --> 00:44:22,546
I have always believed...

504
00:44:22,951 --> 00:44:26,785
...helping your fellow man
is profitable in every sense...

505
00:44:26,889 --> 00:44:29,255
...personally and bottom-line.

506
00:44:29,358 --> 00:44:35,352
My fellow shareholders,
if Europe and America can learn to cooperate...

507
00:44:35,530 --> 00:44:39,398
...if we can learn to pool our wealth,
share our markets...

508
00:44:39,501 --> 00:44:44,566
...we can defeat any competition anywhere in the world.

509
00:44:45,474 --> 00:44:50,652
Let me thank you for the time you have given me
here today, and I hope, that you will look favorably...

510
00:44:50,656 --> 00:44:52,604
...on my proposal. Thank you.

511
00:44:58,253 --> 00:45:01,347
Listen, let me at this microphone here!

512
00:45:01,456 --> 00:45:04,721
How can we let a criminal like that, run our company?

513
00:45:04,826 --> 00:45:07,453
He's got the map of Sicily on his face,
can't you see it?

514
00:45:07,462 --> 00:45:13,453
- Order! Order!   - He's either a Catholic
or a Mafiosi and I say how do you like them bananas?

515
00:45:13,602 --> 00:45:17,361
The Hamilton Investor's group cannot support this proposal.

516
00:45:18,774 --> 00:45:21,242
Your excellency?

517
00:45:21,343 --> 00:45:26,162
Mr. Chairman, the Vatican Bank feels,...

518
00:45:26,248 --> 00:45:30,015
...that international Immobiliare...

519
00:45:31,620 --> 00:45:35,781
...will be safe in Mr. Corleone's hands.

520
00:45:35,791 --> 00:45:41,095
Subject to audit and final ratification
which must take place in Rome,...

521
00:45:41,196 --> 00:45:44,324
...please join me in welcoming Mr. Michael Corleone.

522
00:45:54,776 --> 00:45:57,035
<i>- Dad?
- Uh huh?</i>

523
00:45:59,147 --> 00:46:02,514
Tony says that I'm a front for the foundation.

524
00:46:04,186 --> 00:46:07,849
That you're using me just to pull the strings.

525
00:46:07,956 --> 00:46:11,050
- To get the money where you want it...
- Oh come on, please.

526
00:46:11,159 --> 00:46:13,593
...to shine up your public image.

527
00:46:13,764 --> 00:46:19,698
Mary. Mary, this is real this foundation, it's real.

528
00:46:21,803 --> 00:46:24,431
I wanted Anthony to be a part of it.

529
00:46:24,539 --> 00:46:29,014
I wanted -- I thought the two of you
would be together on this. I won't interfere.

530
00:46:29,111 --> 00:46:31,679
- I'll help, only, only if you ask.
- But...

531
00:46:31,680 --> 00:46:36,352
...what is this really for?
Why are you doing this?

532
00:46:36,451 --> 00:46:39,181
Why am I doing this?

533
00:46:39,287 --> 00:46:44,515
I'm doing this for my children.
You're doing it for your children too.

534
00:46:45,260 --> 00:46:48,320
This foundation is supposed to help all people.

535
00:46:48,430 --> 00:46:50,762
Of course, that's the purpose.

536
00:46:50,866 --> 00:46:53,494
This is legitimate, Mary.

537
00:46:53,602 --> 00:46:55,802
I swear this is legitimate.

538
00:46:59,775 --> 00:47:03,074
Dad, I want this to bring me closer to you.

539
00:47:11,086 --> 00:47:15,496
I would burn in hell, to keep you safe.

540
00:47:28,904 --> 00:47:33,539
No no, no, you go in the other car,
I'll ride with Michael. Go, go, go.

541
00:47:47,989 --> 00:47:53,787
As your family's oldest friend,
I'm always chosen to bring you messages.

542
00:47:56,164 --> 00:47:58,564
Tell me, Don Altobello.

543
00:48:01,002 --> 00:48:05,095
Your old partners are grateful
for the money you've made them...

544
00:48:05,107 --> 00:48:08,372
...they, they worship you.

545
00:48:08,477 --> 00:48:11,310
But their hearts are broken...

546
00:48:11,413 --> 00:48:14,871
...because they think you abandoned them.

547
00:48:14,983 --> 00:48:18,612
They want to share your deal on Immobiliare.

548
00:48:19,621 --> 00:48:24,151
To be a family again.
It can purify their money.

549
00:48:26,528 --> 00:48:27,927
This I cannot do.

550
00:48:31,032 --> 00:48:34,092
Immobiliare must be legitimate.

551
00:48:35,937 --> 00:48:40,571
I know. But they're unhappy.

552
00:48:43,078 --> 00:48:44,841
And you?

553
00:48:44,946 --> 00:48:48,844
I ask nothing for myself.

554
00:48:48,917 --> 00:48:51,078
Only peace in my old age.

555
00:48:51,186 --> 00:48:54,314
But I - I must please the world around me.

556
00:48:56,458 --> 00:49:00,952
Michael, your father was a reasonable man.

557
00:49:01,062 --> 00:49:02,962
Learn from him.

558
00:49:04,733 --> 00:49:08,635
I learned many things from my father.

559
00:49:13,708 --> 00:49:16,006
Call a meeting, my friend.

560
00:49:16,111 --> 00:49:20,172
So there are no debts, or grudges.

561
00:49:20,282 --> 00:49:23,745
We will make the peace. You and I.

562
00:50:03,058 --> 00:50:05,117
They just had a press conference.

563
00:50:05,227 --> 00:50:10,188
They said the Pope's condition was grave.
Gravisimo, they said.

564
00:50:46,167 --> 00:50:50,066
Please. Our group represents...

565
00:50:50,171 --> 00:50:56,169
...a consortium of Catholic businessmen,
against the Corleone control.

566
00:50:56,278 --> 00:51:01,679
The Vatican has cast its vote.
The Corleone group already controls the board.

567
00:51:01,783 --> 00:51:05,785
According to the lateran treaty,
the Vatican support must be ratified...

568
00:51:05,787 --> 00:51:09,518
...here in Rome by the Pope.

569
00:51:13,061 --> 00:51:16,360
The Pope is gravely ill.

570
00:51:17,599 --> 00:51:22,390
Until he recovers, I am powerless.

571
00:51:22,437 --> 00:51:24,667
What if he dies?

572
00:51:24,773 --> 00:51:29,565
Then, as you Americans say, all bets are off.

573
00:51:29,644 --> 00:51:35,548
Gentlemen please, this is a brief delay.

574
00:51:35,650 --> 00:51:37,140
Nothing more.

575
00:51:41,656 --> 00:51:45,148
Your excellency, gentlemen...

576
00:51:45,260 --> 00:51:51,199
...I advise, you join us in our prayers
for the Holy Father’s recovery.

577
00:51:52,100 --> 00:51:53,795
Now we had an agreement!

578
00:51:55,070 --> 00:51:58,972
And this meeting was to be merely,
a formality, that's all it was.

579
00:51:59,074 --> 00:52:02,510
- Please sit down.
- I'd rather stand. Could someone just give me an answer?

580
00:52:02,610 --> 00:52:08,353
- We have put ourselves on the line...
- The Immobiliare has its roots in the European tradition.

581
00:52:08,450 --> 00:52:09,917
Please try to understand.

582
00:52:10,018 --> 00:52:14,088
I understand. Your tactics are despicable.

583
00:52:14,189 --> 00:52:17,755
Well, that's quite an indictment,
coming from a Corleone.

584
00:52:17,759 --> 00:52:22,792
Gentlemen - gentlemen!
Remember, you are in the Vatican, please.

585
00:52:25,633 --> 00:52:28,033
What is it that you want?

586
00:52:28,136 --> 00:52:32,198
Yes -- you will take control.

587
00:52:32,240 --> 00:52:36,199
We'll gladly put you at the helm of our little fleet.

588
00:52:36,311 --> 00:52:40,543
But our ships, must all sail in the same direction.

589
00:52:41,783 --> 00:52:47,516
Otherwise, who can say how long,
your stay with us will last?

590
00:52:49,657 --> 00:52:53,766
It's not personal, it's only business.

591
00:52:53,862 --> 00:52:56,292
You should know, Godfather.

592
00:52:59,534 --> 00:53:05,102
Very well. You want to do business with me.

593
00:53:05,206 --> 00:53:10,399
I will, do business, with you.
Vipers, all of them.

594
00:53:16,484 --> 00:53:19,419
- We're back with the Borgias.
- Uncle Michael.

595
00:53:19,521 --> 00:53:21,148
Andrew.

596
00:53:21,256 --> 00:53:24,316
I heard you were here.
It's so nice to see you.

597
00:53:24,426 --> 00:53:27,190
- Vincent.
- How are you, Andrew? - You look so nice.

598
00:53:27,295 --> 00:53:30,787
Listen, what is this with the Borgias?
Those days are over Uncle Michael...

599
00:53:36,070 --> 00:53:39,471
- Recognize it?
- Yeah.

600
00:53:39,574 --> 00:53:41,701
Genco Olive Oil.

601
00:53:41,810 --> 00:53:46,485
That's where our Grandfather got his start.
Started as a delivery boy, made three bucks a week.

602
00:53:46,481 --> 00:53:48,481
Three years later, he owned the company.

603
00:53:48,583 --> 00:53:51,677
- Only in America.
- That's it.

604
00:53:51,786 --> 00:53:56,989
Hey Vincenzo, where have you been hiding?
You deserted us, and we need your help so badly.

605
00:53:56,991 --> 00:53:58,653
Well now I'm back, what can I do for you?

606
00:53:58,659 --> 00:54:01,219
Get rid of Joe Zasa.
He sells drugs to children.

607
00:54:01,329 --> 00:54:04,189
Listen, when I was a young girl it was different.
Now I'm an old woman...

608
00:54:04,198 --> 00:54:05,961
...I'm afraid to walk the streets at night, you know?

609
00:54:05,967 --> 00:54:08,233
Where are they supposed to be at?

610
00:54:08,336 --> 00:54:10,668
<i>- Lou, what's going on?
- He's going pazzo.</i>

611
00:54:10,772 --> 00:54:12,897
- We're late.
- Don't tell me that garbage.

612
00:54:12,907 --> 00:54:15,967
- Have I ever let you down?
- I trust you.

613
00:54:16,077 --> 00:54:18,511
- Don't worry about it.
- Thank you very much.

614
00:54:18,613 --> 00:54:20,444
- Bye bye.
- Enjoy yourself.

615
00:54:26,855 --> 00:54:31,688
- What was that?
- The neighborhood's in trouble.

616
00:54:31,726 --> 00:54:34,786
- You keep your eye out for them?
- That's right.

617
00:54:34,896 --> 00:54:37,694
- And for me?
- From now on.

618
00:54:37,799 --> 00:54:40,029
I missed you all this time.

619
00:54:40,134 --> 00:54:42,534
I missed you, too, cousin.

620
00:54:42,637 --> 00:54:45,538
I missed growing up with all my cousins.

621
00:54:45,640 --> 00:54:48,074
I didn't even know you and I missed you.

622
00:54:48,176 --> 00:54:53,345
Do you remember stories about our fathers,
the old days?

623
00:54:53,347 --> 00:54:55,547
Yeah. What do you want to know?

624
00:54:58,019 --> 00:54:59,577
What was Sonny like?

625
00:55:02,190 --> 00:55:04,784
He was the Prince of the city.

626
00:55:04,893 --> 00:55:08,727
Yeah -- he died before I was born but I
heard a million stories about him, he was a legend.

627
00:55:10,498 --> 00:55:12,591
What about my father?

628
00:55:12,700 --> 00:55:18,268
A great man, your father.
He's a hero, he saved the family.

629
00:55:19,541 --> 00:55:21,441
- Vincent.
- What?

630
00:55:21,543 --> 00:55:24,273
Did he kill his own brother?

631
00:55:28,274 --> 00:55:29,274
No.

632
00:55:32,120 --> 00:55:34,782
So those are all lies?

633
00:55:38,126 --> 00:55:41,826
Just stories, sweetheart. Okay?

634
00:55:45,269 --> 00:55:49,863
Okay. I believe you.

635
00:55:51,372 --> 00:55:55,308
- I'm glad you're around.
- I'm glad you're here too.

636
00:56:18,032 --> 00:56:21,365
I'd like to take Joey Zasa up
for a ride in this and drop him.

637
00:56:21,469 --> 00:56:24,370
Joey Zasa is nothing.

638
00:56:24,472 --> 00:56:26,940
He's a small-time enforcer.

639
00:56:27,041 --> 00:56:29,839
He bluffs, threats, but nothing.

640
00:56:29,944 --> 00:56:32,669
We'll be able to see him coming, a mile away.

641
00:56:33,414 --> 00:56:35,575
- We should kill him before he kills...
- No.

642
00:56:38,820 --> 00:56:43,888
Never hate your enemies. It affects your judgment.

643
00:56:58,773 --> 00:57:02,265
Good evening.
Nice to see you again, Mr. Corleone.

644
00:57:22,563 --> 00:57:25,498
Okay, girls, let's go.
Come on, girls.

645
00:57:42,717 --> 00:57:47,086
We entrusted you to manage our money in the casinos.

646
00:57:47,188 --> 00:57:53,093
It's not even 20 years. You sold the casinos,
and you made fortunes for all of us.

647
00:57:53,194 --> 00:57:55,094
Bravo, Don Corleone!

648
00:57:57,565 --> 00:57:58,691
Thank you.

649
00:57:59,901 --> 00:58:03,234
Friends, I have come here...

650
00:58:03,337 --> 00:58:07,000
...because our business together is done.

651
00:58:08,409 --> 00:58:12,140
We have prospered, and now it is time for us...

652
00:58:12,246 --> 00:58:15,543
...to dissolve the business relationship between us.

653
00:58:17,251 --> 00:58:22,646
That's it. But I do have a little surprise. Al?

654
00:58:25,326 --> 00:58:28,124
Your shares in the casino.

655
00:58:28,229 --> 00:58:32,629
I thought I'd cut through all the red tape
so you can get your money right away.

656
00:58:38,673 --> 00:58:42,973
- $50 million!
- Not everybody gets the same.

657
00:58:43,077 --> 00:58:47,011
- It depends how much you invested, and how long for.
- nothing for you.

658
00:58:47,115 --> 00:58:50,084
Michael, this is really generous!

659
00:58:50,184 --> 00:58:52,243
Oh, wonderful.

660
00:58:55,356 --> 00:58:59,824
- Hey, Perisi, how much did you invest?
- I don't remember.

661
00:58:59,827 --> 00:59:02,454
Michael, you're blessed.

662
00:59:07,535 --> 00:59:12,844
My family has done much of the hard work;
taken many risks.

663
00:59:14,475 --> 00:59:17,735
All to make money, for the rest of the families.

664
00:59:19,947 --> 00:59:22,780
You all know Joey Zasa.

665
00:59:22,884 --> 00:59:25,284
He is, I admit, an important man.

666
00:59:26,420 --> 00:59:30,618
<i>His picture is on the cover
of the New York Times magazine.</i>

667
00:59:30,725 --> 00:59:33,319
<i>He gets the Esquire magazine award,...</i>

668
00:59:33,427 --> 00:59:35,952
...for the best-dressed gangster.

669
00:59:36,063 --> 00:59:37,963
The newspapers praise him...

670
00:59:38,065 --> 00:59:42,663
...because, he hires Blacks into his family,
which shows he has a good heart.

671
00:59:44,906 --> 00:59:47,431
He is famous.

672
00:59:47,542 --> 00:59:51,342
Who knows?
Maybe one day...

673
00:59:51,445 --> 00:59:54,109
...he will make all of you popular.

674
00:59:55,316 --> 00:59:56,715
It's true.

675
00:59:56,818 --> 01:00:02,454
<i>I make more of a bella figura.
That is my nature.</i>

676
01:00:02,456 --> 01:00:07,589
But I also want to make a move
into legitimate enterprises.

677
01:00:07,595 --> 01:00:10,359
I'd like to get a little pin from the Pope.

678
01:00:10,464 --> 01:00:15,902
Sure, I take the Blacks and the Spanish into my family...

679
01:00:16,003 --> 01:00:19,504
...because that's America.

680
01:00:19,507 --> 01:00:24,274
And you guarantee that they don't
deal drugs in those neighborhoods.

681
01:00:25,379 --> 01:00:30,578
I don't guarantee that.
I guarantee I'll kill anybody who does.

682
01:00:34,689 --> 01:00:37,453
Let me talk to him, let me talk to him.

683
01:00:37,558 --> 01:00:40,088
Who can refuse Don Altobello?

684
01:00:43,130 --> 01:00:47,430
No! I say to all of you,
I have been treated this day...

685
01:00:47,535 --> 01:00:49,935
...with no respect.

686
01:00:50,037 --> 01:00:55,373
I've earned you all money.
I've made you rich, and I asked for little.

687
01:00:55,476 --> 01:00:59,378
Good. You will not give?
I'll take.

688
01:01:00,648 --> 01:01:03,308
As for Don Corleone...

689
01:01:03,317 --> 01:01:07,480
...well, he makes it very clear to me today...

690
01:01:07,488 --> 01:01:10,285
...that he is my enemy.

691
01:01:13,294 --> 01:01:15,694
You must choose between us.

692
01:01:24,272 --> 01:01:28,831
We can reason together - no - Michael,

693
01:01:28,841 --> 01:01:33,505
Michael - please, let's agreed, huh?

694
01:01:33,614 --> 01:01:35,514
He doesn't know what he's...

695
01:01:41,991 --> 01:01:45,991
...Uh, Michael, Michael. The news is everywhere.

696
01:01:46,093 --> 01:01:49,995
Everyone is saying that, that you control Immobiliare.

697
01:01:50,097 --> 01:01:55,698
Immobiliare already is laundering money in Peru,
in Nassau, we know that.

698
01:01:55,703 --> 01:01:59,300
Listen to me, Michael.
We've been friends for 40 years.

699
01:01:59,407 --> 01:02:01,270
We should wet our beaks a little.

700
01:02:01,275 --> 01:02:04,640
- We want to do business with you, Michael.
- That's right.

701
01:02:04,645 --> 01:02:08,483
- We've been together for many.
- We can wash our money clean with holy water.

702
01:02:13,821 --> 01:02:15,652
What the hell is that?

703
01:02:15,756 --> 01:02:18,519
- It's a hit. Let's go. Follow me.
- Let's get outta here!

704
01:02:38,312 --> 01:02:41,213
- My coat! It's my lucky coat!
- Forget your coat.

705
01:02:42,316 --> 01:02:44,147
It's my lucky coat!

706
01:02:50,324 --> 01:02:51,923
Stay right behind me!

707
01:03:07,308 --> 01:03:09,942
- Fuck!
- Mikey, this way!

708
01:03:19,520 --> 01:03:21,886
Zasa! You son of a bitch!

709
01:03:41,642 --> 01:03:43,701
Come on, we're outta here.

710
01:04:16,744 --> 01:04:19,143
- You did good, Vincent.
- Grazie.

711
01:04:19,580 --> 01:04:22,674
The old Dons were pretty much wiped out.

712
01:04:22,783 --> 01:04:27,984
- The ones that survived made deals with Joey Zasa.
- Altobello?

713
01:04:28,322 --> 01:04:32,315
He survived.
He's with his daughters now in Staten Island.

714
01:04:32,426 --> 01:04:34,826
Says he's gonna retire to Sicily.

715
01:04:36,597 --> 01:04:41,557
Joey Zasa, would never pull something
like this without backing.

716
01:04:41,669 --> 01:04:45,070
He's just muscle.
He's an enforcer. He's nothing.

717
01:04:45,172 --> 01:04:47,572
He doesn't have the wit for that helicopter attack.

718
01:04:47,675 --> 01:04:50,569
He doesn't even have the ambition,
to wipe out, the whole commission.

719
01:04:50,577 --> 01:04:55,037
- Certainly not the balls.
- I say we hit back and take Zasa out!

720
01:05:00,588 --> 01:05:03,489
Never let anyone know what you're thinking.

721
01:05:11,599 --> 01:05:14,500
All right, let's get a, let's get a message to Joey Zasa.

722
01:05:17,571 --> 01:05:19,630
I respect what he's done.

723
01:05:21,208 --> 01:05:24,302
The new overthrows the old.
It's natural.

724
01:05:24,411 --> 01:05:26,010
How can you do business with this guy?

725
01:05:29,517 --> 01:05:33,678
I'm a businessman, first and foremost.
I want no further conflict with anyone.

726
01:05:33,687 --> 01:05:36,449
Well you tell him from me,
that he can live, or he can die.

727
01:05:36,457 --> 01:05:38,516
Vincent, will you shut up!

728
01:05:56,677 --> 01:05:57,911
That's it.

729
01:06:00,383 --> 01:06:04,783
Joey Zasa. He can't be doing this alone.

730
01:06:08,522 --> 01:06:13,516
Just when I thought I was out,
they pull me back in!

731
01:06:21,268 --> 01:06:26,974
Our true enemy, has not yet, shown his face.

732
01:06:39,687 --> 01:06:43,787
- Has he taken his medicine?
- I don't know what he took. Get him some water!

733
01:06:46,193 --> 01:06:49,661
- I've got my wind back, I've got my wind back.
- Call a doctor.

734
01:06:51,198 --> 01:06:53,291
Run, run!

735
01:06:53,400 --> 01:06:56,460
Run at thunderbolt.
Thunder can't hurt.

736
01:06:56,570 --> 01:06:59,400
Harmless noise!

737
01:06:59,406 --> 01:07:01,499
- Get an ambulance.
- Bullshit!

738
01:07:01,609 --> 01:07:05,409
You deceitful old fuck.

739
01:07:05,512 --> 01:07:08,003
Altobello, you fuck!

740
01:07:26,267 --> 01:07:28,167
Vitals are all steady.

741
01:07:33,007 --> 01:07:34,406
Lift.

742
01:07:38,412 --> 01:07:41,480
- Oh, god. Dad.
- Okay, okay.

743
01:07:43,584 --> 01:07:45,652
Excuse me. Clear, please.

744
01:07:45,653 --> 01:07:47,653
I'll call Kay.

745
01:07:57,931 --> 01:08:02,001
- Good evening, sir. Certainly, sir.
- Can we wait here? We'll be back in a few minutes.

746
01:08:08,542 --> 01:08:12,410
Mr. Harrison, you said it was urgent.

747
01:08:12,513 --> 01:08:15,038
Have you come to confess your sins?

748
01:08:15,149 --> 01:08:17,408
Michael Corleone suffered a diabetic stroke.

749
01:08:17,418 --> 01:08:20,312
I thought you ought to know that
before you read it in the papers.

750
01:08:20,321 --> 01:08:22,682
He's in a coma on the critical list.

751
01:08:22,790 --> 01:08:25,315
I'm here to insist the deal goes through in any event.

752
01:08:25,426 --> 01:08:27,519
The Pope has not much time left.

753
01:08:29,196 --> 01:08:33,223
So, as you, I am in a difficult position.

754
01:08:33,334 --> 01:08:35,734
We have to ratify this deal as soon as possible.

755
01:08:37,438 --> 01:08:39,338
We have an understanding.

756
01:08:39,440 --> 01:08:42,873
Good. I'm going to the hospital.

757
01:08:42,876 --> 01:08:45,888
- I'll pray for Mr. Corleone.
- Thank you.

758
01:08:50,117 --> 01:08:53,685
- Our thoughts are with Mr. Corleone.
- Thank you, Father John.

759
01:08:56,757 --> 01:09:01,558
Everything will be out in the open if Corleone dies.

760
01:09:01,662 --> 01:09:03,755
Pray for time, Keinszig.

761
01:09:03,864 --> 01:09:09,268
A habit born of...
a long contemplation of eternity.

762
01:09:15,876 --> 01:09:19,807
- Just forget about it, Vinnie.
- Why? Why would I forget about it? It's a simple hit.

763
01:09:19,813 --> 01:09:24,173
Look, I'd love to smack Joey Zasa
and then whack the bag, Okay?

764
01:09:24,284 --> 01:09:27,886
But it's impossible.
He's always mingling with people,...

765
01:09:27,888 --> 01:09:30,880
...in front of TV cameras in his own neighborhood.

766
01:09:30,991 --> 01:09:33,619
- It's impossible.
- It's not impossible. It'll work for us.

767
01:09:33,727 --> 01:09:35,285
How?

768
01:09:35,396 --> 01:09:40,024
You think he's gonna let uncle Michael survive this thing?
Would you?

769
01:09:40,534 --> 01:09:44,832
He may not survive anyway.
How would you do it?

770
01:09:44,838 --> 01:09:47,238
I'd do it.
I'd do it myself.

771
01:09:49,343 --> 01:09:51,243
Do it!

772
01:09:53,080 --> 01:09:56,010
- What would you need?
- See if you can get me a couple of guys.

773
01:10:26,311 --> 01:10:27,611
Hello Michael.

774
01:10:31,718 --> 01:10:33,618
It's Kay.

775
01:10:37,919 --> 01:10:39,619
Kay.

776
01:10:42,229 --> 01:10:47,142
- I never expected you.
- No, I know, I know.

777
01:10:49,436 --> 01:10:51,165
But I'm here.

778
01:10:54,942 --> 01:10:57,001
- I'm glad.
- You know...

779
01:11:00,481 --> 01:11:03,047
...this is the first time
I've seen you look so helpless.

780
01:11:07,855 --> 01:11:10,255
It's not so bad, really.

781
01:11:11,825 --> 01:11:16,023
I feel...
I'm getting wiser now.

782
01:11:16,129 --> 01:11:19,428
- Yeah?
- Oh, yeah.

783
01:11:19,533 --> 01:11:21,433
The sicker you get, the wiser you get, huh?

784
01:11:22,936 --> 01:11:25,166
When I'm dead, I'm gonna be really smart.

785
01:11:26,574 --> 01:11:31,066
- Michael - Yeah?
- I want to thank you for Tony.

786
01:11:33,947 --> 01:11:38,247
He's doing really well.
He's gotten some very good notices...

787
01:11:38,352 --> 01:11:44,046
...and he's going to be making his
operatic debut in Sicily in Palermo, this Easter. So,...

788
01:11:45,859 --> 01:11:47,258
...so thank you.

789
01:11:48,562 --> 01:11:51,763
That's a real honor.
In Sicily.

790
01:11:56,870 --> 01:12:00,829
I will be there.
I won't miss that.

791
01:12:00,941 --> 01:12:02,431
I won't miss that.

792
01:12:08,529 --> 01:12:14,419
Mary, Tony. Go see Dad.

793
01:12:19,693 --> 01:12:22,118
- Oh, sweetheart.
- Everything's going to be all right.

794
01:12:24,898 --> 01:12:27,389
- How you doing, papa?
- Come here.

795
01:12:29,369 --> 01:12:32,429
Your mother told me.
She told me what happened.

796
01:12:32,539 --> 01:12:36,134
About Palermo?
I really wanted you to be there, Dad.

797
01:12:36,243 --> 01:12:38,643
Of course. Of course. Kiss me - kiss me.

798
01:12:57,898 --> 01:13:00,057
<i>- Cousin Vinnie?
- No, he isn't here.</i>

799
01:13:00,067 --> 01:13:03,969
Why don't, why don't you call his apartment,
leave a message on his machine?

800
01:13:04,071 --> 01:13:06,437
- It's your cousin, Mary.
- Let her in.

801
01:13:10,344 --> 01:13:13,104
- Thanks. Hi, cuz.
- Hi.

802
01:13:13,113 --> 01:13:15,573
I just thought I'd drop by.
Is that okay?

803
01:13:15,682 --> 01:13:17,582
I'm gonna go get the guys.

804
01:13:19,686 --> 01:13:22,587
No, it's not okay.
You shouldn't have come Mary.

805
01:13:24,224 --> 01:13:26,454
A couple minutes only, okay?

806
01:13:27,861 --> 01:13:30,862
- You look beautiful, cuz.
- Thanks.

807
01:13:33,934 --> 01:13:37,233
So this is your club, your hideout?

808
01:13:37,337 --> 01:13:40,500
- Yeah.
- I came to check it out.

809
01:13:45,112 --> 01:13:49,105
It's so strange,
just me and Aunt Connie in the house.

810
01:13:49,216 --> 01:13:52,208
I feel better when I'm with you.

811
01:13:52,319 --> 01:13:54,014
What's wrong, sweetheart?

812
01:13:54,121 --> 01:13:56,851
- I'm really scared about my father.
- Don't be scared.

813
01:13:56,957 --> 01:14:00,891
When I saw them take him out of that ambulance,
I thought he was dead.

814
01:14:00,894 --> 01:14:03,795
I know.
Everybody says he's gonna be better.

815
01:14:05,666 --> 01:14:07,930
Don't worry, okay?

816
01:14:08,035 --> 01:14:10,595
I remember them shooting at our house
when I was little.

817
01:14:11,772 --> 01:14:14,536
And Al Neri came one time
with other bodyguards...

818
01:14:14,641 --> 01:14:16,700
...which just took me and Tony away.

819
01:14:18,645 --> 01:14:20,704
Is it all happening again?

820
01:14:22,249 --> 01:14:24,149
Not like that, sweetheart.

821
01:14:25,919 --> 01:14:31,516
Then why are you hiding here?
Is something going to happen to you?

822
01:14:31,625 --> 01:14:35,527
Nothing's gonna happen to me, cugina.
I'll take care of you.

823
01:14:46,773 --> 01:14:51,335
- Can I stay here and hide out with you for a while?
- You can help me make gnocchi here for the boys.

824
01:14:51,445 --> 01:14:54,846
You know I don't know how to cook, but I'll help.

825
01:15:08,295 --> 01:15:12,170
- Okay.
- What do I do?

826
01:15:44,231 --> 01:15:47,132
- I love you, cuz.
- I love you, too, cuz.

827
01:15:51,271 --> 01:15:53,171
Okay, let's cook.

828
01:16:09,589 --> 01:16:10,988
Hold me.

829
01:16:47,460 --> 01:16:52,387
You know the people like you in the press,
the police, use words like Mafia, Cosa Nostra.

830
01:16:52,465 --> 01:16:56,333
This is a fantasy.
The Italian-Americans are great people.

831
01:16:56,436 --> 01:16:58,868
We laid the bricks that built this city.
We have the artists.

832
01:16:58,872 --> 01:17:00,940
We have Meucci who invented the telephone.

833
01:17:00,941 --> 01:17:04,672
We have Don Ameche who played the guy
who invented the telephone, eh?

834
01:17:04,778 --> 01:17:08,847
So, listen, come on. Buy yourself a nice raffle ticket.
Maybe win yourself a Cadillac.

835
01:17:10,350 --> 01:17:14,948
<i>This sausage, is wonderful.
Here, have a sandwich. Let's go.</i>

836
01:17:27,734 --> 01:17:31,668
- Nice to see you, Mr. Zasa.
- Have a nice time.

837
01:17:32,906 --> 01:17:35,306
Don't forget to buy your raffle tickets, huh?

838
01:17:38,211 --> 01:17:40,338
- What are you doin'?
- The kid didn't mean nothing.

839
01:17:40,447 --> 01:17:42,938
- He's sorry. Come here son, tell him you're sorry.
- Okay, let's go.

840
01:18:04,871 --> 01:18:06,197
What's what?
How are you?

841
01:18:07,107 --> 01:18:09,632
How are you, buddy boy, huh?

842
01:18:09,712 --> 01:18:13,670
Hey, Joey Zasa! Joey! Up your ass!

843
01:18:15,048 --> 01:18:17,948
- Who is this? I never talked to him. You know him?
- Ignore him.

844
01:18:17,951 --> 01:18:21,785
Hey, Joey, who's gonna win the car, huh?
The Ant?

845
01:18:23,490 --> 01:18:27,684
This is the thing that gives the Italian-Americans
a bad name, huh? A cappone like this, huh?

846
01:18:27,694 --> 01:18:30,394
Hey, Joey, up your ass!

847
01:18:30,396 --> 01:18:33,365
Hey, why don't you get off of the fucking car, huh?
You got a raffle ticket?

848
01:18:34,134 --> 01:18:37,701
Hey Joe, take, take a good look at my raffle ticket,
here we go.

849
01:18:37,804 --> 01:18:41,897
Here's what I think of you, and your raffle ticket.

850
01:18:41,908 --> 01:18:46,738
I told you, get the fuck outta here before I break
your fucking jaw, you understand you son-of-a-bitch!

851
01:18:46,745 --> 01:18:50,979
Now why don't you get the fuck outta here!
Get outta here! Get outta here!

852
01:19:06,433 --> 01:19:08,157
Run, Joey, you piece of shit!

853
01:19:21,881 --> 01:19:24,747
- Open the door! Open the door!
- Hi, Joe.

854
01:19:47,240 --> 01:19:52,735
Don't ever again give that kind of order.

855
01:19:52,846 --> 01:19:56,551
Not while I'm alive. Understand?

856
01:19:57,884 --> 01:20:02,611
You were too sick to make a decision.
I got a go-ahead from Neri.

857
01:20:02,722 --> 01:20:04,212
I got a go-ahead from Connie.

858
01:20:16,102 --> 01:20:19,401
It was the right decision, Uncle Michael.

859
01:20:19,506 --> 01:20:23,574
It was the wrong decision.
I command this family.

860
01:20:23,576 --> 01:20:29,485
Right or wrong! It was not what I wanted!

861
01:20:48,134 --> 01:20:50,068
Do you understand?

862
01:20:56,176 --> 01:20:58,007
Yes.

863
01:21:04,918 --> 01:21:06,476
Come on, Michael.

864
01:21:18,064 --> 01:21:19,463
Yes!

865
01:21:21,601 --> 01:21:23,592
Good. Vincent,...

866
01:21:23,703 --> 01:21:28,697
...help me to my bed.
I wanna talk to you alone for a minute.

867
01:21:35,915 --> 01:21:40,352
You know, I always felt responsible for you.

868
01:21:40,453 --> 01:21:42,011
You know that.

869
01:21:43,423 --> 01:21:49,259
Your father, my brother, we were, opposites.

870
01:21:49,762 --> 01:21:54,626
We would fight and argue.
But I never doubted his love.

871
01:21:54,734 --> 01:21:58,135
He would do anything for me.

872
01:21:58,238 --> 01:22:00,001
But his temper...

873
01:22:03,003 --> 01:22:05,509
...it was too much.

874
01:22:05,612 --> 01:22:11,370
Clouded his reason.
And I don't want you to make that mistake.

875
01:22:13,987 --> 01:22:19,556
Also, he too, had a way with women.

876
01:22:20,128 --> 01:22:25,928
- Vincent...  - So I hear.
- What are you doing with my daughter?

877
01:22:28,601 --> 01:22:30,501
What are you doing with her?

878
01:22:35,375 --> 01:22:37,475
It's too dangerous.

879
01:22:40,013 --> 01:22:41,913
You hear me?

880
01:23:03,414 --> 01:23:04,914
Vincenzo.

881
01:23:09,342 --> 01:23:14,047
When they come, they'll come at what you love.

882
01:23:22,050 --> 01:23:25,383
Michael, you must lead another life.

883
01:23:25,487 --> 01:23:31,448
You have everything a man could desire.
It's time for you to retire.

884
01:23:31,527 --> 01:23:33,927
I have too much responsibility.

885
01:23:37,900 --> 01:23:41,301
Too difficult now.
You should really get out.

886
01:23:41,403 --> 01:23:46,136
<i>What do you know
about those pezzonovante in Italy?</i>

887
01:23:50,045 --> 01:23:53,845
I'm too old to know anything about those new people.

888
01:23:53,949 --> 01:23:58,579
I must accept my age and grow my Olives and Tomatoes.

889
01:23:59,855 --> 01:24:04,622
- We're not that old.
- But you're very ill.

890
01:24:07,396 --> 01:24:09,728
Let me see what can be done.

891
01:24:09,832 --> 01:24:14,059
Let me work to make your path a little easier.

892
01:24:14,069 --> 01:24:17,634
Your friendship does that always.

893
01:24:17,739 --> 01:24:19,639
That makes me happy.

894
01:24:19,678 --> 01:24:24,211
Joey Zasa -- you were wrong about him.

895
01:24:25,647 --> 01:24:28,748
I trust too much.
That's always been my fault.

896
01:24:35,527 --> 01:24:40,518
Michael, treachery is everywhere.

897
01:24:40,629 --> 01:24:46,029
You still have your fingers on the strings,
even now.

898
01:24:46,045 --> 01:24:48,835
Let's see more of each other.

899
01:24:49,006 --> 01:24:53,806
- Michael -- in Sicily?
- In Sicily.

900
01:24:53,807 --> 01:24:58,907
- In Sicilia.
- In Sicilia.

901
01:25:46,762 --> 01:25:49,094
How are you, Don?

902
01:25:49,197 --> 01:25:51,722
Don Bandito, my old friend.

903
01:26:23,065 --> 01:26:25,124
I wanted to bring you here...

904
01:26:25,133 --> 01:26:30,872
...so that my old friend and protector,
Don Tommasino could advise us.

905
01:26:49,191 --> 01:26:53,150
The bloodbath in Atlantic City
left New York a mess.

906
01:26:53,261 --> 01:26:56,719
Now, Joey Zasa at least was running
a very tight ship.

907
01:26:56,832 --> 01:27:00,424
But now that he's out of the picture,
we're obligated to step in.

908
01:27:00,435 --> 01:27:02,494
Step back in?

909
01:27:02,604 --> 01:27:05,004
If we don't,
the Chinese and Colombians will.

910
01:27:36,304 --> 01:27:40,035
Our ships must all sail in the same direction.

911
01:27:41,043 --> 01:27:44,403
Italian politics have had
these kind of men for centuries.

912
01:27:44,513 --> 01:27:47,004
They are the true Mafia.

913
01:27:47,115 --> 01:27:50,482
The Archbishop and the Vatican bank,
that's the big problem.

914
01:27:50,585 --> 01:27:54,919
They're the same problem.
B.J., they're connected.

915
01:27:55,023 --> 01:27:58,049
The Archbishop has very powerful friends.

916
01:28:01,063 --> 01:28:02,894
They totally protect him.

917
01:28:25,195 --> 01:28:26,595
Bene.

918
01:28:28,523 --> 01:28:34,097
I will go see this Cardinal Lamberto and
see if we can work things out in a civilized way.

919
01:28:35,997 --> 01:28:40,696
You honor your agreements.
But these people you're dealing with are crooks.

920
01:28:40,802 --> 01:28:42,702
They have no honor.

921
01:28:45,807 --> 01:28:47,297
My word is final.

922
01:29:24,679 --> 01:29:26,772
I've invited you all here...

923
01:29:26,882 --> 01:29:31,114
...to celebrate my son's
first appearance in an opera house.

924
01:29:31,219 --> 01:29:32,877
- We're playing Philadelphia.
- He'll be appearing...

925
01:29:32,888 --> 01:29:34,948
- ...what's Philadelphia?
- In about three weeks...

926
01:29:34,956 --> 01:29:37,115
...seven cards, two down,
four up, one down...

927
01:29:37,125 --> 01:29:39,193
- ...in the theatre Maximo...
- deuces and one-eyed jacks are wild.

928
01:29:39,194 --> 01:29:41,822
<i>In the opera "Cavalleria Rusticana".</i>

929
01:29:41,930 --> 01:29:45,964
<i>- It's Cavalleria Rusticana Dad.
- Cavalleria.</i>

930
01:29:45,967 --> 01:29:48,802
I think I've got tickets to the wrong opera.

931
01:29:48,904 --> 01:29:52,067
I've been in New York too long.
Anyway...

932
01:29:52,174 --> 01:29:55,735
...you will all receive tickets,. So come on time.

933
01:29:55,844 --> 01:29:57,744
Uh, dad, I've got a present for you.

934
01:30:01,717 --> 01:30:06,184
It comes from the town of Corleone
and uh, it's authentic Sicilian.

935
01:30:07,289 --> 01:30:10,850
And uh, I learned it for you.

936
01:31:40,115 --> 01:31:44,211
<i>She was, wonderful, beautiful.
I loved her.</i>

937
01:31:44,319 --> 01:31:46,549
<i>And she died.</i>

938
01:31:46,655 --> 01:31:50,250
My trusted bodyguard...

939
01:31:50,358 --> 01:31:53,589
...planted a bomb in my car.

940
01:31:53,695 --> 01:31:55,595
She drove it before I did.

941
01:31:57,198 --> 01:32:00,861
Why is such a beautiful country so violent?

942
01:32:00,969 --> 01:32:02,527
History.

943
01:32:02,537 --> 01:32:04,601
You know, mom was telling me about the old days,...

944
01:32:04,606 --> 01:32:09,136
- ...when her biggest worry was just passing exams.
- Yes, it was then.

945
01:32:09,244 --> 01:32:11,235
I worry about you now.

946
01:32:11,244 --> 01:32:16,475
Oh Mary. Mary you're such a warm-hearted girl,
you always were.

947
01:32:16,484 --> 01:32:20,315
- I love my family.
- Even your cousin Vincent?

948
01:32:24,126 --> 01:32:26,089
I really love him.

949
01:32:27,562 --> 01:32:31,794
- He's your first cousin.
- Then I love him first.

950
01:32:31,900 --> 01:32:34,630
Mary, you can't see him.

951
01:32:34,736 --> 01:32:38,103
Just don't see him anymore.

952
01:32:38,206 --> 01:32:42,040
He's right.
It's too dangerous.

953
01:32:44,412 --> 01:32:47,945
Mary, listen to me.
You can't see him anymore.

954
01:32:47,949 --> 01:32:49,878
- Not in that fashion.
- No.

955
01:32:51,619 --> 01:32:54,912
- Please, promise me.
- No!

956
01:32:54,990 --> 01:32:57,388
- Obey me on this Mary!
- No, Dad!

957
01:33:02,731 --> 01:33:07,065
Mary's smart, Dad.
She'll understand eventually.

958
01:33:43,839 --> 01:33:47,036
- You wanted to see me?
- Yeah.

959
01:33:47,142 --> 01:33:49,644
- I want you to do something for me.
- Okay.

960
01:33:49,645 --> 01:33:51,545
It's dangerous.

961
01:33:52,647 --> 01:33:56,483
Good, I'm in.
What do you need?

962
01:33:56,484 --> 01:34:02,191
I want you to sell your soul to Don Altobello to betray me.

963
01:34:05,527 --> 01:34:08,491
He'd never believe me.
Here.

964
01:34:08,496 --> 01:34:10,826
- That depends.
- Sit down.

965
01:34:13,869 --> 01:34:15,769
I have an idea.

966
01:34:17,038 --> 01:34:20,940
See if you can learn
how high Altobello is connected.

967
01:34:24,713 --> 01:34:26,613
Arrange a meeting.

968
01:34:29,150 --> 01:34:34,281
You say how devoted you are to me.
Tell him your problems.

969
01:34:34,389 --> 01:34:38,090
- You ask for his help.
- What problems?

970
01:34:39,461 --> 01:34:41,661
That you want to run away with my daughter.

971
01:34:42,998 --> 01:34:47,401
Only you know that if you do,
I will become your enemy.

972
01:34:52,140 --> 01:34:54,370
You know I would never do that, Uncle Mike.

973
01:34:54,476 --> 01:34:55,534
I know.

974
01:34:56,811 --> 01:35:01,846
<i>You ask Altobello to speak to me.
To further the marriage.</i>

975
01:35:01,917 --> 01:35:04,215
But you're cousins, after all.

976
01:35:04,319 --> 01:35:07,755
Michael was always a little old-fashioned.

977
01:35:08,056 --> 01:35:13,194
<i>Explain to him how, you can never be part of my,
legitimate world. That you want your own family.</i>

978
01:35:13,261 --> 01:35:17,163
I could straighten out what Joey Zasa left behind.

979
01:35:18,900 --> 01:35:21,300
If you could use your friendship to persuade him.

980
01:35:22,837 --> 01:35:25,237
I would be indebted to you forever.

981
01:35:27,709 --> 01:35:31,611
Corleone, knows the value of such a friend.

982
01:35:33,081 --> 01:35:35,481
So then you would work for me?

983
01:35:44,125 --> 01:35:45,786
<i>Remember...</i>

984
01:35:45,894 --> 01:35:50,831
...if he hints that he wants you to betray me, get insulted.

985
01:35:50,932 --> 01:35:52,866
Because that's his trap.

986
01:36:00,508 --> 01:36:03,409
You're not telling me the whole truth, Vincenzo.

987
01:36:06,781 --> 01:36:10,512
Isn't it true, with Michael gone...

988
01:36:10,618 --> 01:36:13,018
...the girl controls everything?

989
01:36:16,524 --> 01:36:18,617
You leave the girl out of this.

990
01:36:18,727 --> 01:36:22,128
Of course, you love her, and she loves you.

991
01:36:43,251 --> 01:36:45,651
I guessed it Vincenzo, huh?

992
01:36:47,288 --> 01:36:50,689
You're a wise man, Don Altobello.

993
01:36:50,792 --> 01:36:53,420
I'm going to be learning a lot from you.

994
01:36:53,528 --> 01:36:56,458
The richest man is the one
with the most powerful friends.

995
01:36:59,033 --> 01:37:02,396
It's my duty to make the introductions.

996
01:37:09,177 --> 01:37:11,077
Don Lucchesi.

997
01:37:13,915 --> 01:37:19,743
Don Altobello tells me you have a good character,
strong, a man of respect.

998
01:37:19,821 --> 01:37:23,621
This is the hero who put Joey Zasa in his grave.

999
01:37:23,725 --> 01:37:28,025
If we'd have known of his existence,
we would never have backed Joey.

1000
01:37:28,129 --> 01:37:33,469
No one wants another Joe.
Let me be your friend.

1001
01:37:35,003 --> 01:37:37,938
Even the strongest man needs friends.

1002
01:37:38,039 --> 01:37:43,239
I'm flattered.
But you're a man of finance and politics, Don Lucchesi,...

1003
01:37:43,244 --> 01:37:45,144
...these are things I don't understand.

1004
01:37:46,914 --> 01:37:48,142
You understand guns.

1005
01:37:49,083 --> 01:37:51,108
Finance is a gun.

1006
01:37:51,219 --> 01:37:55,815
Politics is knowing when to pull the trigger.

1007
01:38:00,361 --> 01:38:01,589
How can I help?

1008
01:38:07,268 --> 01:38:12,872
Blessed is the peacemaker,
for he can be can be called a child of God.

1009
01:38:48,877 --> 01:38:52,438
I trusted this business arrangement
with the Archbishop.

1010
01:38:52,547 --> 01:38:57,644
I trusted him.
I was sure his honesty was beyond a doubt.

1011
01:38:57,652 --> 01:39:02,954
But, as you see, I'm now the victim of a swindle.

1012
01:39:03,058 --> 01:39:04,958
They're stalling me.

1013
01:39:05,060 --> 01:39:09,019
<i>Vast moneys have gone to the pezzonovante
in high political places...</i>

1014
01:39:09,130 --> 01:39:11,860
...and the Vatican bank is the guarantor.

1015
01:39:11,966 --> 01:39:17,233
If uh, what you say is true, there will be a great scandal.

1016
01:39:19,207 --> 01:39:24,338
Look at this stone. It has been lying
in the water for a very long time,...

1017
01:39:24,446 --> 01:39:28,348
...but the water has not penetrated it.

1018
01:39:32,387 --> 01:39:36,289
Look. Perfectly dry.

1019
01:39:37,525 --> 01:39:39,891
The same thing has happened to men in Europe.

1020
01:39:39,994 --> 01:39:44,897
For centuries, they have been
surrounded by Christianity,...

1021
01:39:44,999 --> 01:39:47,524
...but Christ has not penetrated.

1022
01:39:47,635 --> 01:39:51,036
Christ doesn't breathe within them.

1023
01:39:55,076 --> 01:39:57,203
- What's happening?
- Is it possible...

1024
01:39:57,312 --> 01:40:00,247
...that you could get me something sweet?

1025
01:40:00,348 --> 01:40:02,748
Orange juice, anything, a candy.

1026
01:40:06,321 --> 01:40:08,380
I have a little trouble with diabetes.

1027
01:40:12,360 --> 01:40:14,260
Blood sugar levels must be low.

1028
01:40:15,396 --> 01:40:17,296
I understand.

1029
01:40:39,787 --> 01:40:43,450
When I'm under stress, sometimes this happens.

1030
01:40:43,558 --> 01:40:45,458
I understand.

1031
01:40:47,295 --> 01:40:50,896
I come to you, on such a delicate matter...

1032
01:40:53,835 --> 01:40:56,804
...accusations against your Archbishop.

1033
01:40:56,905 --> 01:40:58,964
It was difficult for me.

1034
01:41:00,208 --> 01:41:06,153
The mind suffers and the body, cries out.

1035
01:41:10,985 --> 01:41:13,044
That's true.

1036
01:41:14,522 --> 01:41:18,856
Would you like, to make your confession?

1037
01:41:25,500 --> 01:41:29,059
Your Eminence, I'm uh - I'm uh...

1038
01:41:31,372 --> 01:41:37,011
...it's been so long, I wouldn't -
I wouldn't - I wouldn't know where to uh,...

1039
01:41:38,346 --> 01:41:40,246
...it's been 30 years.

1040
01:41:41,383 --> 01:41:44,874
I'd - I'd - I'd use up too much of your time, I think.

1041
01:41:44,986 --> 01:41:48,280
I always have time to save souls.

1042
01:41:49,490 --> 01:41:52,591
Well, I'm -- I'm beyond redemption.

1043
01:42:03,705 --> 01:42:08,765
I hear the confessions of my young priests here.

1044
01:42:08,776 --> 01:42:12,710
Sometimes the desire to confess is overwhelming...

1045
01:42:12,714 --> 01:42:15,114
...and we must seize the moment.

1046
01:42:20,121 --> 01:42:24,749
What is the point of confessing if I don't repent?

1047
01:42:26,361 --> 01:42:29,660
I hear you are a practical man.

1048
01:42:29,764 --> 01:42:33,024
What have you got to lose, huh?

1049
01:42:43,745 --> 01:42:44,975
Go on.

1050
01:42:51,919 --> 01:42:56,368
I uh, betrayed my wife.

1051
01:42:57,992 --> 01:42:59,892
Go on, my son.

1052
01:43:05,300 --> 01:43:07,200
I betrayed myself.

1053
01:43:10,071 --> 01:43:11,971
I killed men.

1054
01:43:15,710 --> 01:43:18,110
And I ordered men to be killed.

1055
01:43:19,747 --> 01:43:21,647
Go on, my son, go on.

1056
01:43:26,789 --> 01:43:29,017
Nah, it's useless.

1057
01:43:31,092 --> 01:43:32,992
Go on, my son.

1058
01:43:34,095 --> 01:43:35,995
I killed...

1059
01:43:40,735 --> 01:43:44,398
...I ordered the death of my brother.

1060
01:43:44,505 --> 01:43:46,405
He injured me.

1061
01:43:47,809 --> 01:43:50,403
I killed my mother's son.

1062
01:43:51,779 --> 01:43:53,872
I killed my father's son.

1063
01:44:04,592 --> 01:44:09,397
Your sins are terrible, and it is just that you suffer.

1064
01:44:10,565 --> 01:44:16,195
Your life, could be redeemed,
but I know that you don't believe that.

1065
01:44:16,204 --> 01:44:18,104
You will not change.

1066
01:45:10,305 --> 01:45:11,505
Connie,...

1067
01:45:13,694 --> 01:45:17,896
...all my life I, kept trying to go up in society,...

1068
01:45:18,833 --> 01:45:22,334
...where everything higher up was legal, straight.

1069
01:45:23,704 --> 01:45:26,864
But the higher I go, the crookeder it becomes.

1070
01:45:30,044 --> 01:45:32,103
How in the hell does it end?

1071
01:45:41,189 --> 01:45:44,190
Killing each other for centuries here.

1072
01:45:45,927 --> 01:45:50,296
For money, for pride, for family.

1073
01:45:53,367 --> 01:45:57,369
<i>To keep from becoming the slaves
of the rich pezzonovante.</i>

1074
01:46:04,412 --> 01:46:10,371
I made confession, Connie.
I confessed my sins.

1075
01:46:11,319 --> 01:46:17,390
Why Michael, that's not like you.
You don't have to confess your sins to a stranger.

1076
01:46:17,391 --> 01:46:18,824
It was the man.

1077
01:46:20,228 --> 01:46:24,375
A good man. A true priest.

1078
01:46:28,069 --> 01:46:29,969
He can change things.

1079
01:46:32,270 --> 01:46:33,470
Michael,...

1080
01:46:35,343 --> 01:46:41,082
...you know, sometimes I think of poor Fredo, drowned.

1081
01:46:42,149 --> 01:46:44,049
It was God's will.

1082
01:46:45,920 --> 01:46:48,320
It was a terrible accident.

1083
01:46:49,423 --> 01:46:51,323
But it's finished.

1084
01:46:56,731 --> 01:46:58,631
Michael, I love you.

1085
01:47:01,002 --> 01:47:02,902
I'll always help you.

1086
01:47:12,713 --> 01:47:14,613
It's okay.

1087
01:49:54,742 --> 01:49:57,233
- Welcome.
- Oh, Connie! How are you?

1088
01:49:57,344 --> 01:50:00,936
- Mary, I missed you.
- I've missed you too.

1089
01:50:00,948 --> 01:50:02,848
- Well, hello Michael.
- Hello Kay.

1090
01:50:02,950 --> 01:50:08,519
- Mom, look at this.
- What, let me see - oh! My - wow!

1091
01:50:08,522 --> 01:50:10,949
You know it's too bad that Douglas couldn't be with us.

1092
01:50:10,958 --> 01:50:14,555
No, no, I know. He wanted to come very much,
but he had a very important trial.

1093
01:50:14,562 --> 01:50:17,690
- I know he wanted to come.
- I know.

1094
01:50:17,798 --> 01:50:19,698
- The car is...
- Okay.

1095
01:50:21,736 --> 01:50:25,797
Well, your son's an artist, huh?

1096
01:50:25,906 --> 01:50:29,599
- Oh, yes, thanks to you.
- Oh, what for?

1097
01:50:30,678 --> 01:50:34,942
- For making me let him go.
- Oh, well.

1098
01:50:35,049 --> 01:50:38,880
After all these years,
here I am in Sicily for the first time.

1099
01:50:38,886 --> 01:50:41,586
- I want to get a picture of you together.
- Oh, Okay.

1100
01:50:43,958 --> 01:50:45,858
Hey, Dad, smile.

1101
01:50:49,830 --> 01:50:53,261
I see you still have Al Neri.
Why?

1102
01:50:54,502 --> 01:50:58,834
Well, I need him.
He helps me get in and out of the car.

1103
01:50:58,839 --> 01:51:01,137
Carry my briefcase.

1104
01:51:01,242 --> 01:51:03,938
You're still a liar, Michael.

1105
01:51:04,044 --> 01:51:07,502
Let me show you Sicily. The real Sicily.

1106
01:51:07,615 --> 01:51:10,513
Maybe you'll understand
the family history a little better.

1107
01:51:10,518 --> 01:51:12,918
Oh I think I understand it well enough.

1108
01:52:04,939 --> 01:52:08,440
Anthony, I have something you made for me...

1109
01:52:09,543 --> 01:52:11,443
...a very long time ago.

1110
01:52:12,613 --> 01:52:15,741
- It may bring you luck.
- Thanks.

1111
01:52:19,486 --> 01:52:21,044
You saved it, huh?

1112
01:52:21,155 --> 01:52:23,646
- Remember?
- I remember.

1113
01:52:26,193 --> 01:52:28,093
Thank you Dad.

1114
01:52:30,364 --> 01:52:34,273
- I'm proud of you.
- Thank you.

1115
01:52:50,451 --> 01:52:53,179
- Are they as good as they look?
- They're better.

1116
01:52:53,187 --> 01:52:58,122
They're the best.
As long as they're around, Uncle Michael is safe.

1117
01:52:58,158 --> 01:52:59,923
- Bye.
- Bye.

1118
01:53:02,630 --> 01:53:05,098
- Tell your father I'll be back for dinner.
- Okay.

1119
01:53:06,367 --> 01:53:09,129
- Have fun.
- And tell Tony to be sure to wait for me.

1120
01:53:09,136 --> 01:53:11,764
Okay, I will.

1121
01:53:11,872 --> 01:53:14,270
- Bye, mom!
- Buon giorno, Signora.

1122
01:53:14,275 --> 01:53:16,505
At your service.

1123
01:53:20,114 --> 01:53:23,515
If I see dad, I'll tell him you left.

1124
01:53:28,722 --> 01:53:32,758
You're the only one left in this family
with my father's strength.

1125
01:53:34,895 --> 01:53:39,591
If anything happens to Michael,
I want you to strike back.

1126
01:53:41,969 --> 01:53:43,527
I'll have everything ready.

1127
01:53:47,108 --> 01:53:49,008
You swear?

1128
01:53:56,317 --> 01:53:58,376
I swear to you.

1129
01:54:28,582 --> 01:54:30,482
Here it is.

1130
01:54:31,885 --> 01:54:33,944
The house where my father was born.

1131
01:54:35,589 --> 01:54:41,292
This is where they came, to take him when he was a boy.
To kill him.

1132
01:54:44,298 --> 01:54:47,699
Wait, listen to that.

1133
01:55:07,855 --> 01:55:10,013
You know, Mary's in love.

1134
01:55:11,225 --> 01:55:13,550
Yes, I know.

1135
01:55:14,161 --> 01:55:19,392
With a handsome young Italian man
with dark eyes.

1136
01:55:19,400 --> 01:55:21,300
I won't allow it.

1137
01:55:24,104 --> 01:55:28,001
It's wrong.
It's wrong, and it's dangerous.

1138
01:56:00,140 --> 01:56:01,801
Honor, huh?

1139
01:56:21,061 --> 01:56:24,330
You know, I remember the time
that you came to my parent's house.

1140
01:56:24,331 --> 01:56:27,730
And you took me into that room.
And you told me about the family business...

1141
01:56:27,734 --> 01:56:33,331
...and how you were never going to have
anything to do with it. You sounded like Tony.

1142
01:56:33,974 --> 01:56:35,874
I was a lot like Tony.

1143
01:56:43,484 --> 01:56:46,453
- I can barely see. Kay.
- What?

1144
01:56:46,553 --> 01:56:49,215
- You mind driving?
- No. What's wrong?

1145
01:56:49,323 --> 01:56:53,052
My eyes... sometimes
they're all right, and then...

1146
01:56:53,060 --> 01:56:56,288
- Ssure.
- Listen, I have to see Don Tommasino.

1147
01:56:58,265 --> 01:57:00,028
Oh! Oh, my God!

1148
01:57:00,134 --> 01:57:06,233
- Well there's no bodyguards today.
- I really snuck away.

1149
01:57:54,834 --> 01:57:59,234
- Calo, how are you?
- Hi. Nice to see you.

1150
01:57:59,293 --> 01:58:01,256
- How are you?
- Bene. - Hi.

1151
01:58:01,261 --> 01:58:03,161
- Kay, this is Calo, my old friend.
- How do you do?

1152
01:58:03,163 --> 01:58:05,063
One of my bodyguards in the old days.

1153
01:58:10,470 --> 01:58:11,969
- We can wait here.
- You want drink?

1154
01:58:11,972 --> 01:58:14,373
- Yes. Shall we go in?
- Sure.

1155
01:58:17,945 --> 01:58:21,345
I spent a lot of time in this room...

1156
01:58:22,683 --> 01:58:24,412
...thinking of you.

1157
01:58:27,554 --> 01:58:30,114
And then you got married.

1158
01:58:33,293 --> 01:58:34,851
I still thought of you.

1159
01:58:35,629 --> 01:58:37,529
What's in that room?

1160
01:58:41,335 --> 01:58:45,735
You know this is dangerous for you, Michael.
This is Sicily.

1161
01:58:47,975 --> 01:58:50,375
- I love this country.
- Why?

1162
01:58:53,080 --> 01:58:59,077
Well, all through history,
terrible things have happened to these people.

1163
01:58:59,986 --> 01:59:01,784
Terrible injustices.

1164
01:59:02,889 --> 01:59:08,222
But they still expect good
rather than bad will happen to them.

1165
01:59:08,228 --> 01:59:10,628
Sort of like me and you, huh?

1166
01:59:14,701 --> 01:59:18,068
- How so?
- Well I'm still here, right?

1167
01:59:18,171 --> 01:59:19,661
We do have a bad history.

1168
01:59:20,607 --> 01:59:24,143
- But I'm still here.
- Oh Yes, you are, but with dread.

1169
01:59:28,949 --> 01:59:30,812
Give me the order. Come on.

1170
01:59:30,817 --> 01:59:34,047
What is that supposed to do,
is that supposed to make me not dread you?

1171
01:59:36,623 --> 01:59:39,223
We're in Sicily. It's opera.

1172
01:59:41,328 --> 01:59:42,727
Okay.

1173
01:59:45,465 --> 01:59:47,524
What do we do now?

1174
01:59:50,337 --> 01:59:54,596
Be reasonable. Let's try not to hurt each other.

1175
02:00:01,782 --> 02:00:03,682
I want you to forgive me.

1176
02:00:06,453 --> 02:00:10,181
- For what?
- Everything.

1177
02:00:14,201 --> 02:00:20,090
- Like God, huh?
- Oh, I - I need something a little closer.

1178
02:00:22,769 --> 02:00:25,736
You couldn't understand back in those days...

1179
02:00:27,507 --> 02:00:32,541
I love my father.
I swore I would never be, a man like him...

1180
02:00:32,546 --> 02:00:37,147
...but I loved him.
And he was in danger; what could I do?

1181
02:00:37,150 --> 02:00:40,415
And then later you were in danger.

1182
02:00:40,520 --> 02:00:45,057
Our children were in danger.
What could I do?

1183
02:00:45,058 --> 02:00:51,150
You were all that I loved, valued, most in the world.

1184
02:00:52,165 --> 02:00:54,825
And now I'm losing you.
I lost you anyway.

1185
02:00:55,936 --> 02:01:01,176
You're gone, and it was all for nothing.

1186
02:01:01,274 --> 02:01:02,673
So...

1187
02:01:06,513 --> 02:01:11,773
...you have to understand,
I had a whole different destiny planned.

1188
02:01:15,055 --> 02:01:17,450
All right, I'll stop.

1189
02:01:27,667 --> 02:01:31,464
I really don't know what you want from me,
Michael - I really don't know.

1190
02:01:31,471 --> 02:01:36,702
- I mean...
- I'm not the man that you think I am?

1191
02:01:38,145 --> 02:01:42,013
- I don't know.
- I love you, Kay.

1192
02:01:43,216 --> 02:01:46,185
Don't dread me anymore.

1193
02:01:51,124 --> 02:01:55,864
You know, every night here in Sicily.

1194
02:01:57,097 --> 02:02:02,592
I dream, about my wife and my children.

1195
02:02:05,572 --> 02:02:08,206
And how I lost them.

1196
02:02:09,876 --> 02:02:15,871
I guess, if it's any consolation,
I want you to know that...

1197
02:02:18,952 --> 02:02:24,051
...that -- I always loved you, Michael.

1198
02:02:25,358 --> 02:02:31,351
And, you know...
I always - I always will.

1199
02:05:03,617 --> 02:05:08,091
<i>Frederik Keinszig,
known for a decade as "God's banker,"...</i>

1200
02:05:08,098 --> 02:05:12,132
<i>...has been reported missing.
He was last seen three days ago,...</i>

1201
02:05:12,135 --> 02:05:17,494
<i>...leaving the Rome offices of the Vatican
owned corporation International Immobiliare.</i>

1202
02:05:17,497 --> 02:05:21,762
<i>Also missing was a large sum of money,
and several documents.</i>

1203
02:05:21,768 --> 02:05:24,468
Come on, Keinszig, you fool.

1204
02:05:28,174 --> 02:05:33,204
<i>Mr. Keinszig's absence casts further
suspicion on the dealings of the Vatican bank.</i>

1205
02:05:33,213 --> 02:05:36,146
<i>For several years, the bank
and its subsidiary companies...</i>

1206
02:05:36,149 --> 02:05:40,709
<i>...have been the object of allegations
of disreputable business practices.</i>

1207
02:05:41,310 --> 02:05:42,710
Lucchesi,...

1208
02:05:42,722 --> 02:05:48,713
...will you please try and understand?
I have phoned him.

1209
02:05:48,962 --> 02:05:51,362
I have waited here by the phone.

1210
02:05:53,867 --> 02:05:58,500
<i>You would do well to remember, Mr. Lucchesi...</i>

1211
02:05:58,505 --> 02:06:03,799
...that this Pope has very different ideas...

1212
02:06:03,810 --> 02:06:05,778
...from the last one.

1213
02:06:27,333 --> 02:06:29,733
Good-bye, my old friend.

1214
02:06:31,438 --> 02:06:33,838
You could've lived a little longer.

1215
02:06:35,542 --> 02:06:38,443
I could be closer to my dream.

1216
02:06:44,350 --> 02:06:46,910
You were so loved, Don Tommasino.

1217
02:06:51,925 --> 02:06:55,827
Why was I so feared, and you so loved?

1218
02:06:56,930 --> 02:07:01,408
What was it?
I was no less honorable.

1219
02:07:03,803 --> 02:07:05,703
I wanted to do good.

1220
02:07:10,009 --> 02:07:12,910
What betrayed me?
My mind? My heart?

1221
02:07:15,949 --> 02:07:18,349
Why do I condemn myself so?

1222
02:07:24,858 --> 02:07:29,261
I swear on the lives of my children.

1223
02:07:33,567 --> 02:07:36,768
Give me a chance to redeem myself,...

1224
02:07:40,640 --> 02:07:44,542
...and I will sin no more.

1225
02:08:07,700 --> 02:08:12,703
You look pale. Bad news.
Tell me right away.

1226
02:08:14,274 --> 02:08:19,911
It's not just a bad banking deal.
These guys are butchers.

1227
02:08:21,114 --> 02:08:23,014
What guys?

1228
02:08:23,016 --> 02:08:27,109
Lucchesi. He controls all of them.

1229
02:08:27,220 --> 02:08:30,121
Altobello, the Archbishop,...

1230
02:08:31,224 --> 02:08:33,988
...other people higher up, P2, maybe.

1231
02:08:34,093 --> 02:08:37,961
Secret, unknown.
They're running things.

1232
02:08:40,867 --> 02:08:43,768
- I'm in their way.
- Yeah.

1233
02:08:43,870 --> 02:08:48,064
He's hired a professional assassin to kill you.
He's Sicilian.

1234
02:08:48,074 --> 02:08:52,577
I don't know his name.
They say he never fails.

1235
02:08:54,614 --> 02:08:56,514
Then no one is safe.

1236
02:08:59,552 --> 02:09:01,952
Even the new Pope is in danger.

1237
02:09:03,122 --> 02:09:07,124
No. We still have time. We can prevent this.

1238
02:09:11,564 --> 02:09:13,864
I tried Vincent.

1239
02:09:16,035 --> 02:09:21,038
I tried, to keep everything from coming to this.

1240
02:09:22,108 --> 02:09:27,202
But it's not possible. Not in this, world.

1241
02:09:28,214 --> 02:09:30,148
Give me the order.

1242
02:09:33,686 --> 02:09:35,586
You won't be able to go back.

1243
02:09:36,890 --> 02:09:40,018
- You'll be like me.
- Good.

1244
02:09:40,126 --> 02:09:45,862
All my life I wanted out. I wanted the family, out.

1245
02:09:47,400 --> 02:09:53,181
Well I don't want out.
I want the power to preserve the family.

1246
02:09:57,710 --> 02:09:59,610
I'm asking for the order.

1247
02:10:20,667 --> 02:10:26,267
- It's done.
- Because I can't do it anymore.

1248
02:10:30,143 --> 02:10:35,945
Well, it doesn't matter.
Vincent knows what to do. Come on outside.

1249
02:10:35,949 --> 02:10:39,475
Take a rest and -- and don't think about it.

1250
02:10:39,485 --> 02:10:45,585
- All I do is think about it.
- I'm your son. Command me in all things.

1251
02:10:48,161 --> 02:10:50,061
Give up my daughter.

1252
02:10:53,062 --> 02:10:59,132
That's the price you pay, for the life you choose.

1253
02:11:24,764 --> 02:11:30,564
Nephew, from this moment on,...

1254
02:11:32,272 --> 02:11:34,372
...call yourself Vincent Corleone.

1255
02:11:39,479 --> 02:11:40,878
Sit.

1256
02:13:44,579 --> 02:13:46,879
Et Tu, Vincenzo?

1257
02:13:46,973 --> 02:13:52,141
I know how you feel about Michael,
but you, you can't save him.

1258
02:13:52,145 --> 02:13:57,255
He's lost.
Think of yourself.

1259
02:13:58,551 --> 02:14:00,951
What's your answer, Vincent?

1260
02:14:03,156 --> 02:14:05,056
Enjoy the opera.

1261
02:14:07,093 --> 02:14:08,993
It's all taken care of.

1262
02:14:13,833 --> 02:14:16,333
You check the balcony.
I'll check the top fioor.

1263
02:14:20,540 --> 02:14:26,531
"Here's hoping Tony sings better at Theatre Maximo
than he does in the shower. Love, Douglas."

1264
02:14:27,713 --> 02:14:29,913
My darling, Constanzia.

1265
02:14:32,351 --> 02:14:35,251
- This is a great occasion. Yes.
- Come and sit down.

1266
02:14:39,859 --> 02:14:41,759
Happy birthday.

1267
02:14:41,861 --> 02:14:46,586
You're 80 years old, you don't look more than 60.
You're the only one who remembered.

1268
02:14:46,592 --> 02:14:51,998
Michael, we just got the word.
The Pope's ratifying the Immobiliare deal. We've won.

1269
02:14:52,004 --> 02:14:53,904
Congratulations.

1270
02:14:56,676 --> 02:14:59,076
How strange, the way things work.

1271
02:14:59,178 --> 02:15:02,679
The Pope's doing exactly what you said he'd do,
he's cleaning house.

1272
02:15:03,683 --> 02:15:08,745
Well, he should be careful.
It's dangerous to be an honest man.

1273
02:15:14,126 --> 02:15:16,926
I wanna put more muscle backstage with Tony.

1274
02:15:29,242 --> 02:15:34,753
- On your birthday, you used to shower me with treats.
- Tootsie Rolls!

1275
02:15:35,748 --> 02:15:41,387
The nuns who made these cannolis took
a vow of silence. They're the very finest.

1276
02:15:46,692 --> 02:15:52,691
- Hey, cuz.
- Where's your leather?

1277
02:15:56,369 --> 02:15:57,802
Stop it.

1278
02:16:03,676 --> 02:16:07,477
You're so thin.
You eat it.

1279
02:16:30,670 --> 02:16:35,273
It's over Mary. There are things I have to do
that you can't be a part of.

1280
02:16:35,274 --> 02:16:38,668
Don't look at your father,
it's not your father's decision, it's mine.

1281
02:16:40,112 --> 02:16:42,512
Don't hate your father.

1282
02:16:44,283 --> 02:16:48,417
There are things I'm going to be part of,
you can't be around.

1283
02:16:50,156 --> 02:16:54,956
- After tonight, you won't see me anymore.
- No.

1284
02:16:57,363 --> 02:17:00,159
You gotta understand,
Mary -- you gotta understand.

1285
02:17:01,934 --> 02:17:03,834
I'll always love you.

1286
02:17:16,749 --> 02:17:18,216
Love somebody else.

1287
02:17:41,006 --> 02:17:43,206
- To Tony.
- To Tony.

1288
02:20:59,538 --> 02:21:03,899
- They won't try anything.
- Yeah, everything is fine. It's all clear I think.

1289
02:21:03,909 --> 02:21:07,069
I've already sent Al Neri to the Vatican.

1290
02:23:56,381 --> 02:23:58,611
Check out the side.

1291
02:26:22,160 --> 02:26:25,061
Good. You got him.

1292
02:27:16,615 --> 02:27:19,415
<i>Tonight the Corleone family settles its accounts.</i>

1293
02:27:20,419 --> 02:27:26,023
<i>Keinszig -- that little Swiss banker fuck.</i>

1294
02:27:26,024 --> 02:27:30,788
<i>He's been swindling everyone from the beginning.
Fuck him.</i>

1295
02:27:31,630 --> 02:27:37,530
<i>Don Lucchesi. My friend.
Calo will pay him a visit at his home.</i>

1296
02:27:39,671 --> 02:27:42,872
<i>Neri, take a train to Rome.</i>

1297
02:27:44,643 --> 02:27:46,543
<i>Light a candle for the Archbishop.</i>

1298
02:29:49,935 --> 02:29:55,003
Michael, it's serious. Our man inside the
Vatican says there's a plot against the Pope.

1299
02:29:55,006 --> 02:29:57,567
You mean he's going to have a heart attack in the night.

1300
02:30:04,449 --> 02:30:09,452
This Pope has powerful enemies.
We may not be in time to save him.

1301
02:30:12,791 --> 02:30:14,290
Now let's go back to the opera.

1302
02:32:38,903 --> 02:32:43,281
Sleep. Sleep, Godfather.

1303
02:36:32,203 --> 02:36:34,698
- I like this opera.
- Yeah, I figured you would.

1304
02:36:34,706 --> 02:36:37,197
- Bravo. Say hello.
- Thank you.

1305
02:36:43,381 --> 02:36:45,611
- Did you like it?
- Great.

1306
02:36:47,452 --> 02:36:49,784
Let's get out of here.

1307
02:36:59,164 --> 02:37:03,230
- Can I please talk to you now?
- Not now Mary, it's not a good time.

1308
02:37:03,234 --> 02:37:07,236
- You're just like my father.
- Come on, stay with the family. Go on.

1309
02:37:08,473 --> 02:37:10,536
- Talk to me.
- The twins are dead.

1310
02:37:10,542 --> 02:37:14,544
<i>In about one minute, there's going to be
carabinieri crawling all over this place.</i>

1311
02:37:15,747 --> 02:37:18,407
- Okay. Let's get everybody to the cars, nice and quiet.
- Okay.

1312
02:37:18,416 --> 02:37:20,316
- Got it.
- Quiet.

1313
02:37:34,933 --> 02:37:38,227
When they hear the name Corleone,
they're going to think of a voice.

1314
02:37:47,979 --> 02:37:49,674
Dad.

1315
02:37:57,655 --> 02:37:59,122
This is my mom.

1316
02:38:08,499 --> 02:38:13,326
Dad? Why are you doing this to me.

1317
02:38:21,579 --> 02:38:25,115
- Go on, move back. Go on, move back.
- Hey, move!

1318
02:38:25,116 --> 02:38:31,013
- You don't have to do this to me, Please.
- Doing what? What do you mean?

1319
02:38:31,122 --> 02:38:32,814
Mary, please come...

1320
02:38:56,147 --> 02:38:57,605
Dad?

1321
02:39:14,834 --> 02:39:19,235
- No! Mary!
- Oh, God!

1322
02:39:19,241 --> 02:39:24,941
Oh, God, No! Oh, God, no, Please!

1323
02:39:26,778 --> 02:39:28,377
Mom, come on.

1324
02:39:45,930 --> 02:39:47,629
Let her go.

1325
02:39:52,704 --> 02:39:54,704
Let go.
