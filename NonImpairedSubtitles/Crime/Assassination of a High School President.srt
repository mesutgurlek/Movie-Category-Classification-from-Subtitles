00:10:29,842 --> 00:10:32,174
Now, one of you little vermin

154
00:10:32,712 --> 00:10:36,113
broke into this office
and stole the SATs last night.

155
00:10:38,084 --> 00:10:39,881
Of this l am certain.

156
00:10:41,788 --> 00:10:45,747
l beg you, l beseech you,
do not come forward.

157
00:10:46,559 --> 00:10:50,120
Because l will have the pleasure
of tracking you down,

158
00:10:50,196 --> 00:10:54,656
much the same way that l tracked down
that camel-humping ammunitions envoy

159
00:10:54,734 --> 00:10:59,398
two klicks east of the Tigris,
the birthplace of civilization.

160
00:11:01,874 --> 00:11:03,341
Mr. Cipriato?

161
00:11:03,409 --> 00:11:07,470
Do you know what the Arabic word
<i>''la hariq''</i> means?

162
00:11:07,547 --> 00:11:10,539
-No.
-lt means, ''Don't shoot.''

163
00:11:11,184 --> 00:11:12,651
''Don't shoot!''

164
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:16,845
May want to remember that.

165
00:11:16,923 --> 00:11:18,356
Dismissed!

166
00:11:43,082 --> 00:11:45,414
Hey, Francesca.

167
00:11:46,152 --> 00:11:47,619
Hey, Funke.

168
00:11:55,561 --> 00:12:00,225
So, what are you doing in the men's room?

169
00:12:01,634 --> 00:12:06,094
Well, l thought l might find a man in here.
Are you a man, Funke?

170
00:12:14,213 --> 00:12:16,511
l'm just screwing with you.

171
00:12:17,517 --> 00:12:19,348
l just need your help.

172
00:12:20,253 --> 00:12:21,618
With what?

173
00:12:21,687 --> 00:12:25,748
Whoever stole the SATs.
l need you to find them and get them back.

174
00:12:27,894 --> 00:12:31,386
l aced that thing, l know it.
l was just in the zone.

175
00:12:33,032 --> 00:12:35,557
Do you know what ''mastication'' means?

176
00:12:35,935 --> 00:12:39,029
-No.
-Me, neither. But in that moment, l did.

177
00:12:39,739 --> 00:12:44,142
lt was perfect. l need you to find those tests.

178
00:12:46,212 --> 00:12:47,406
Why me?

179
00:12:49,549 --> 00:12:52,746
l don't know,
l've got a feeling about you, Funke.

180
00:12:52,819 --> 00:12:55,117
This stuff's right up your alley.

181
00:13:03,129 --> 00:13:06,394
So do you have any idea
who might have taken the SATs?

182
00:13:06,466 --> 00:13:08,434
We took the SATs?

183
00:13:08,501 --> 00:13:11,026
l didn't. l didn't.

184
00:13:11,471 --> 00:13:12,870
Did you take them?

185
00:13:12,939 --> 00:13:16,102
No, l didn't take them.
Everyone was in the classrooms.

186
00:13:16,175 --> 00:13:19,110
That's what all the commotion was about.

187
00:13:21,114 --> 00:13:23,548
Okay, where were you last night?

188
00:13:27,954 --> 00:13:30,218
That's where l was last night.

189
00:13:58,050 --> 00:14:00,848
Hey, Funke. Funke, want a gumball?

190
00:14:01,621 --> 00:14:04,181
lt's good. lt's soft. lt's sweet.

191
00:14:04,257 --> 00:14:06,020
l'm not falling for the gumball trick, Cipriato,

192
00:14:06,092 --> 00:14:08,720
so you can put your ballbag
back in your pants.

193
00:14:09,595 --> 00:14:12,462
What's it like sucking on
another man's fingers?

194
00:14:12,532 --> 00:14:14,124
What's it like stealing the SATs?

195
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:15,667
l asked you first.

196
00:14:20,106 --> 00:14:22,074
-Where were you that night?
-What do you care?

197
00:14:22,141 --> 00:14:24,041
l'm writing your biography.

198
00:14:24,110 --> 00:14:27,307
Fine, let me copy off you
and l'll tell you.

199
00:14:27,547 --> 00:14:28,912
Fine.

200
00:14:29,916 --> 00:14:33,374
l was at the Park Arms with my nana,
playing bingo.

201
00:14:34,453 --> 00:14:37,889
l got 30 fucking geriatrics
that can back that up.

202
00:14:39,091 --> 00:14:41,286
l'm touched, Cipriato.

203
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:42,952
Not a word, Funke.

204
00:14:49,068 --> 00:14:53,334
<i>After tailing Landis, I discovered</i>
<i>her secret life outside of school</i>

205
00:14:56,576 --> 00:15:00,740
<i>She opened up, once I promised</i>
<i>to keep her ice-capades under wraps</i>

206
00:15:01,447 --> 00:15:05,941
l don't know who took them, Nancy Drew,
but l do know it happened during the game.

207
00:15:06,018 --> 00:15:08,543
l was out in the parking lot last night
and l saw some flashlight

208
00:15:08,621 --> 00:15:11,317
bounce around in <i>K</i>irkpatrick's office.

209
00:15:11,724 --> 00:15:13,851
What were you doing in the parking lot?

210
00:15:13,926 --> 00:15:17,157
l was probably getting fingered
by Dutch Middleton.

211
00:15:18,998 --> 00:15:22,297
Okay. Thanks, Landis.

212
00:15:23,502 --> 00:15:24,662
Long time no see, Rocky.

213
00:15:24,737 --> 00:15:26,728
Weekends and holidays, man.

214
00:15:26,806 --> 00:15:28,967
-Thanks.
-Did you do it?

215
00:15:29,041 --> 00:15:30,303
No. You?

216
00:15:30,376 --> 00:15:34,073
l wish. Those tests are the tool
of the racist bourgeoisie.

217
00:15:34,146 --> 00:15:35,943
Back to your cage, butt-boy.

218
00:15:39,085 --> 00:15:43,317
Last night? No, man.
l got picked up for possession,

219
00:15:43,389 --> 00:15:47,450
spent the night in holding.
lt's the creepy. You know.

220
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:49,523
l was fucked up.

221
00:15:50,796 --> 00:15:52,661
That's some alibi.

222
00:15:52,732 --> 00:15:55,895
Fuck it, fuck it. Hold this.
This is my jam, man.

223
00:16:07,213 --> 00:16:09,943
<i>None of these bad apples</i>
<i>had stolen the tests</i>

224
00:16:10,016 --> 00:16:13,884
<i>Their alibis were like Dutch ovens</i>
<i>Gamey, but airtight</i>

225
00:16:15,121 --> 00:16:19,455
<i>Maybe I was looking at it all wrong</i>
<i>Maybe a good kid was behind it</i>

226
00:16:19,525 --> 00:16:21,550
What scares you, Funke?

227
00:16:21,861 --> 00:16:24,261
You know what scares me? lnjustice.

228
00:16:24,330 --> 00:16:27,060
You know why? Because it's everywhere.

229
00:16:27,566 --> 00:16:31,229
You think l don't see Cipriato
behind me jerking off right now?

230
00:16:31,304 --> 00:16:34,967
He's a dead man. l'll deal with him.

231
00:16:37,009 --> 00:16:41,446
But the thing about fighting injustice
is choosing your battles wisely.

232
00:16:41,847 --> 00:16:46,511
And my battle right now is to find out
where are my missing SATs.

233
00:16:47,987 --> 00:16:51,855
Now, l don't know your involvement
in all this, Funke,

234
00:16:53,893 --> 00:16:55,724
but l'm watching you.

235
00:16:56,395 --> 00:16:59,489
l got both eyes open and they're on you.

236
00:17:00,266 --> 00:17:02,325
-You read me?
-Yes. Yes.

237
00:17:02,401 --> 00:17:04,995
You bleed, Funke. We all bleed.

238
00:17:06,105 --> 00:17:07,834
Thank you, sir.

239
00:17:10,943 --> 00:17:14,276
Tad, am l going to get my story
on the girls' bowling team any time soon?

240
00:17:14,347 --> 00:17:16,645
Get off my fucking back, Clara!

241
00:17:16,716 --> 00:17:19,310
Nobody gives two shits about girls' bowling.

242
00:17:19,385 --> 00:17:21,376
l give two shits, okay?

243
00:17:21,454 --> 00:17:23,854
How many more shits
do l need to get a story from you, Tad?

244
00:17:23,923 --> 00:17:25,288
And Bobby?

245
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:29,286
Yeah?

246
00:17:29,795 --> 00:17:32,093
Where's my story on Paul Moore?

247
00:17:36,001 --> 00:17:39,334
<i>Paul was a good kid</i>
<i>Maybe his bum knee wasn't so bad</i>

248
00:17:39,405 --> 00:17:41,999
<i>Maybe my puff piece was no pastry</i>

249
00:17:42,074 --> 00:17:43,268
lt's on its way.

250
00:17:43,743 --> 00:17:45,643
So how long...

251
00:17:47,113 --> 00:17:49,877
So how did Paul's knee look that night?

252
00:17:51,250 --> 00:17:53,514
Okay. Why?

253
00:17:53,986 --> 00:17:58,946
Well, because, Nurse Platt, Paul injured it.
That's why they brought him here.

254
00:18:00,993 --> 00:18:02,961
l thought he had diarrhea.

255
00:18:03,195 --> 00:18:08,462
But he was limping,
so l guess he did hurt his little stem.

256
00:18:09,568 --> 00:18:10,728
Yeah.

257
00:18:12,838 --> 00:18:14,032
Okay.

258
00:18:14,874 --> 00:18:19,334
So were you... Were you here with him
in the office the whole time?

259
00:18:19,412 --> 00:18:20,606
Yeah.

260
00:18:20,679 --> 00:18:25,139
Well, except l got hungry, and Paul
said l should get something to eat.

261
00:18:25,217 --> 00:18:26,343
His treat.

262
00:18:26,419 --> 00:18:31,584
So, l went across the street and got a gyro
at that Greek place, Little Spyros.

263
00:18:32,491 --> 00:18:36,120
Have you ever been there? lt's so good.

264
00:18:36,629 --> 00:18:39,826
Do you mean to tell me
that Paul was alone in here?

265
00:18:39,899 --> 00:18:43,164
l mean, so good.

266
00:18:45,738 --> 00:18:48,764
How long did you leave Paul
on his own that night?

267
00:18:51,777 --> 00:18:53,210
Hey, D.

268
00:18:54,113 --> 00:18:57,412
When l go get Greek food,
how long does it take me?

269
00:18:58,050 --> 00:19:00,644
About 20 minutes. You know, more or less.

270
00:19:01,987 --> 00:19:03,921
Hey, what's up, Frankie?

271
00:19:04,256 --> 00:19:06,622
Look, just get me the sandwich.

272
00:19:06,692 --> 00:19:09,525
Yeah, l want a foot-long
spicy ltalian sausage.

273
00:19:09,595 --> 00:19:13,258
That's right. Yeah. l got one and l want one.

274
00:19:13,699 --> 00:19:15,758
Yeah, see that's a double-entendre.

275
00:19:15,835 --> 00:19:19,032
Yeah. That's right.
l coached English for two seasons.

276
00:19:19,104 --> 00:19:21,163
l got to go. l got to go.

277
00:19:23,676 --> 00:19:25,871
All right, so where were we?

278
00:19:25,945 --> 00:19:28,038
Paul Moore's college prospects.

279
00:19:28,113 --> 00:19:30,308
You know, grades have never been
Paul's strong suit.

280
00:19:30,382 --> 00:19:32,646
But, you know, if he wants to go lvy,
he'll get in.

281
00:19:32,718 --> 00:19:35,243
Believe me,
that boy will do whatever it takes to win.

282
00:19:35,321 --> 00:19:38,449
That's PMW. That is the Paul Moore way.

283
00:19:38,524 --> 00:19:40,890
P-Moore! P-Moore!

284
00:19:41,961 --> 00:19:45,522
<i>The coach gave me Paul's motive</i>
<i>The nurse, opportunity</i>

285
00:19:45,598 --> 00:19:47,623
<i>My gut said I had my guy</i>

286
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:52,330
<i>But on the way home, I realized I needed</i>
<i>an inside source to back it all up</i>

287
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:56,831
<i>I also needed to get my license</i>

288
00:19:56,909 --> 00:19:59,935
<i>Lately me and the DMV</i>
<i>weren't seeing eye-to-eye</i>

289
00:20:00,012 --> 00:20:02,344
And when parking along a curb
on an uphill slope,

290
00:20:02,414 --> 00:20:04,939
we turn our wheels to the... Nope.

291
00:20:05,017 --> 00:20:08,885
And when there's a yellow light,
we approach the intersection at a nice...

292
00:20:09,655 --> 00:20:10,849
Nope.

293
00:20:11,290 --> 00:20:15,818
And when we come to an object
in the road, like a dog, we...

294
00:20:20,533 --> 00:20:21,600
Nope.

295

Okay.

00:20:56,669 --> 00:21:00,298
Well, has Paul ever taken you
to one of his games before?

You're a high-schooler
and you don't have a car?

Why don't you have a car?

00:21:06,512 --> 00:21:08,503
That's irrelevant, Chrissy.

308
00:21:11,283 --> 00:21:13,012
l want a unicorn.

309
00:21:15,754 --> 00:21:16,880
Neat.

310
00:21:16,956 --> 00:21:20,119
You know, when l was your age,
l wanted a pet giraffe.

311
00:21:20,192 --> 00:21:23,753
Giraffes suck. Get me a unicorn,

312
00:21:23,829 --> 00:21:28,493
and l'll tell you so many secrets about Paul.
Very secret secrets.

313
00:21:29,602 --> 00:21:35,063
Here's the thing, Chrissy,
unicorns don't actually exist.

314
00:21:35,140 --> 00:21:37,938
A stuffed-animal unicorn, doofus!

315
00:21:51,156 --> 00:21:54,148
<i>Chrissy Moore was one unicorn well spent</i>

316
00:21:54,693 --> 00:21:59,426
<i>After she filled in the blanks,</i>
<i>my story was right there in front of me</i>

317
00:21:59,498 --> 00:22:01,864
<i>But I still had no solid proof</i>

318
00:22:02,334 --> 00:22:05,235
<i>Were my hunches enough</i>
<i>to write the article?</i>

319
00:22:09,174 --> 00:22:11,904
<i>Fuck it Woodward and Bernstein</i>

320
00:22:13,879 --> 00:22:16,643
Hey, l won't tell you again, Ongatumamwe!

321
00:22:16,715 --> 00:22:18,808
This is P-Moore's shampoo!

322
00:22:18,884 --> 00:22:22,684
l've got enough clout around here
to get your ass deported for less.

323
00:22:26,792 --> 00:22:29,260
You fellows here for the cockfight?

324
00:22:46,111 --> 00:22:49,979
This story's going to start, like,
a frigging coup d'etat on this bitch.

325
00:22:50,516 --> 00:22:52,916
Thanks, man. l like your dreads.

326
00:23:04,797 --> 00:23:06,162
Thanks.

327
00:23:09,668 --> 00:23:13,104
l didn't do anything. l didn't do anything.

328
00:23:13,739 --> 00:23:16,367
This is crazy. l didn't do anything.

329
00:23:16,608 --> 00:23:20,635
Hey, l'm the president.
l'm the president. l'm Paul Moore.

330
00:23:21,180 --> 00:23:22,442
l'm Paul Moore.

331
00:23:22,514 --> 00:23:24,607
l didn't do any... l didn't do anything.

332
00:23:24,683 --> 00:23:27,345
lt's all right. l didn't do anything.
Don't worry.

333
00:23:28,020 --> 00:23:29,647
-Open it up.
-l didn't do...

334
00:23:29,722 --> 00:23:31,155
Open it up.

335
00:23:37,730 --> 00:23:38,924
l don't... l don't know where those...

336
00:23:38,997 --> 00:23:41,693
l don't know what those are.
Those aren't Paul Moore's!

337
00:23:41,767 --> 00:23:43,166
l don't...

338
00:23:44,636 --> 00:23:46,001
l don't know how those got...

339
00:23:46,071 --> 00:23:47,402
Let's go.

340
00:23:47,740 --> 00:23:50,072
Come on, Paul. Don't fight it.

341
00:23:50,142 --> 00:23:53,873
This is crazy. l'm a patsy! l'm a patsy!

342
00:23:56,515 --> 00:23:59,211
''But in the end Paul Moore kept his promise.

343
00:23:59,284 --> 00:24:02,117
''He did whatever it took to get the job done.

344
00:24:02,187 --> 00:24:06,556
''Even the unthinkable.
PMW. The Paul Moore way.''

345
00:24:07,593 --> 00:24:09,493
The name's Bobby Funke.

346
00:24:10,796 --> 00:24:12,354
l write for the paper.

347
00:24:20,072 --> 00:24:23,405
So l just want everyone to know
that l'm submitting this article

348
00:24:23,475 --> 00:24:27,104
to the Northwestern people
with my highest recommendation.

349
00:24:42,261 --> 00:24:44,991
l wanted to thank you for finding the SATs.

350
00:24:45,464 --> 00:24:48,456
And for showing me
what a douche Paul really is.

351
00:24:50,169 --> 00:24:53,536
See, the thing is, l seem to have lost
my date to homecoming,

352
00:24:53,605 --> 00:24:55,766
and l wanted to know if you'd go with me.

353
00:24:55,841 --> 00:24:57,706
You want to go to homecoming with me?

354
00:24:57,776 --> 00:24:58,936
Well, not like ''go'' go.

355
00:24:59,011 --> 00:25:00,205
-l mean, not like for real.
-Yeah.

356
00:25:00,279 --> 00:25:02,304
lt's just everyone already has a date.

357
00:25:02,381 --> 00:25:03,541
-Right.
-Except for the mathletes

358
00:25:03,615 --> 00:25:07,051
and maybe that wrestler
with the jock itch on his face.

359
00:25:07,119 --> 00:25:08,381
So yeah...

360
00:25:08,754 --> 00:25:11,382
The only person l can go with is you.

361
00:25:12,324 --> 00:25:15,782
l still don't see why you wanna go with me.

362
00:25:16,261 --> 00:25:19,128
Yeah, why not? l mean,
you're like the school's Wolf Blitzer now.

363
00:25:19,198 --> 00:25:23,931
Wolf Blitzer's like a TV reporter.
l'm into Woodward and Bernstein.

364
00:25:24,369 --> 00:25:26,360
You already have a date?

365
00:25:26,738 --> 00:25:28,706
What? No. l just...

366
00:25:29,575 --> 00:25:32,339
Great. Then you can pick me up at 8:00.

367
00:25:33,078 --> 00:25:36,275
And no wrist corsages.
Get the kind with the pin.

368
00:25:36,348 --> 00:25:39,579
l don't mind a little prick
every once in a while.

369
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:45,281
St. Donovan's, good morning.
This is your principal, Mr. <i>K</i>irkpatrick.

370
00:25:45,357 --> 00:25:48,986
As you know, there's been
a regime change here at the school,

371
00:25:49,061 --> 00:25:50,551
and your new president,

372
00:25:50,629 --> 00:25:53,564
-Marlon Paizza, is gonna say a few words...
-Piazza.

373
00:25:53,632 --> 00:25:55,429
-What?
-Marlon Piazza.

374
00:25:56,268 --> 00:25:58,759
<i>-What's that? Italian?</i>
<i>-I think so</i>

375
00:25:58,837 --> 00:26:02,500
<i>Marlon Piazza is going to say</i>
<i>a few words to you Stand by</i>

376
00:26:02,574 --> 00:26:05,372
You're on the air. No effing around, huh?

377
00:26:06,645 --> 00:26:09,113
Thank you, sir. Fellow students,

378
00:26:10,515 --> 00:26:13,507
this has been a difficult time for all of us.

379
00:26:14,486 --> 00:26:16,750
<i>But do not lose faith in this institution,</i>

380
00:26:16,822 --> 00:26:20,758
<i>because from great tragedy</i>
<i>comes great triumph</i>

381
00:26:21,226 --> 00:26:25,686
<i>Let me be the first to say</i>
<i>that the actions of your ex-president</i>

382
00:26:33,272 --> 00:26:34,671
lt's open.

383
00:26:50,222 --> 00:26:51,883
Hey, Marlon.

384
00:27:12,644 --> 00:27:16,136
So is it true that she got
a perfect score on her SATs?

385
00:27:16,214 --> 00:27:20,583
Yeah, her freshman year.
l'll let you play with her tits for 20 bucks.

386
00:27:24,156 --> 00:27:27,421
Hey, Funke. You're good.

387
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:30,221
lt's a nice place you got here.

388
00:27:30,295 --> 00:27:34,254
Have a good look while you can.
l doubt you'll be coming by again.

389
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:51,516
l guess that l should congratulate you
on your new presidency.

390
00:27:51,583 --> 00:27:54,848
lsn't it funny how someone can be
your average cakewalk VP one day

391
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:56,911
and then head of the school the next?

392
00:27:56,989 --> 00:28:00,925
Yeah. lt's like how someone
can be the school joke one day

393
00:28:00,993 --> 00:28:04,451
and then go to homecoming with
the hottest girl at St. Donovan's the next.

394
00:28:04,529 --> 00:28:06,053
She's, like, your half-sister, right?

395
00:28:06,131 --> 00:28:07,621
Step-sister.

396
00:28:09,234 --> 00:28:10,633
Hey, Funke.

397
00:28:11,737 --> 00:28:13,398
Hey, Francesca.

398
00:28:16,375 --> 00:28:19,867
Wow, you look awesome.

399
00:28:21,146 --> 00:28:22,477
Thanks.

400
00:28:22,547 --> 00:28:24,845
You look pretty good yourself.

401
00:28:25,083 --> 00:28:26,983
Like your shoes.

402
00:28:27,052 --> 00:28:30,749
She doesn't have to go
to the hospital again, does she?

403
00:28:32,791 --> 00:28:34,315
ls your car out front?

404
00:28:34,393 --> 00:28:38,090
Well, it's such a nice night,
l thought that we could walk.

405
00:29:03,321 --> 00:29:07,815
Sorry about that. l just can't seem
to get away from my friends sometimes.

406
00:29:09,127 --> 00:29:11,288
Yeah. l know what you mean.

407
00:29:12,497 --> 00:29:14,590
You still want that dance?

408
00:29:17,903 --> 00:29:20,133
Quantum physics is bullshit!

409
00:29:20,205 --> 00:29:23,572
Yeah. You don't know
what is inside of a black hole

410
00:29:23,642 --> 00:29:26,941
because, you know, stuff goes in

411
00:29:28,413 --> 00:29:30,347
but nothing comes out.

412
00:29:31,583 --> 00:29:33,915
Just like Laura Hoffner's box.

413
00:29:58,944 --> 00:30:01,378
You think l'm a bitch, don't you?

414
00:30:02,514 --> 00:30:04,982
l mean, you can be honest.
l don't care either way.

415
00:30:05,050 --> 00:30:08,542
l'm just curious. Do you think l'm a bitch?

416
00:30:13,692 --> 00:30:15,751
-<i>K</i>ind of.
-Seriously?

417
00:30:15,827 --> 00:30:19,763
Well, l mean, no.
Like l thought you were, but... And then...

418
00:30:20,098 --> 00:30:25,730
l don't know. Now, l think that maybe
you're just misunderstood.

419
00:30:27,339 --> 00:30:29,273
Nobody's misunderstood.

420
00:30:30,075 --> 00:30:33,943
That's just what people say
when they don't like who they are.

421
00:30:35,981 --> 00:30:39,815
lf you think l'm a bitch,
then l guess it's because l am.

422
00:30:41,419 --> 00:30:43,046
But then l guess you're going to have
to come to terms

423
00:30:43,121 --> 00:30:46,488
with the fact
that you're into a girl who's a bitch.

424
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:50,492
Well, how do you feel
about newspaper dorks?

425
00:30:50,562 --> 00:30:52,894
l'll let you know when l see one.

426
00:31:06,244 --> 00:31:11,580
Great. You know, l better go get Marlon
before <i>K</i>irkpatrick castrates him.

427
00:31:13,752 --> 00:31:15,913
Thanks for the dance, Funke.

428
00:31:39,778 --> 00:31:42,906
Dude, l think that chick just winked at me.

429
00:31:44,716 --> 00:31:46,183
She's not bad.

430
00:31:46,251 --> 00:31:47,946
Yeah, for a pirate.

431
00:31:48,820 --> 00:31:51,380
l'm going to go spit in the punch.

432
00:31:54,125 --> 00:31:58,721
Hey, you light on your feet, Funke.
That's good.

433
00:31:58,797 --> 00:31:59,786
-Thanks.
-But we notice

434
00:31:59,864 --> 00:32:01,855
you having a problem out there.

435
00:32:01,933 --> 00:32:04,561
-l do? What?
-lt's your hard-on.

436
00:32:04,636 --> 00:32:07,867
Yeah, that close to a girl like her,
it's natural.

437
00:32:08,473 --> 00:32:10,668
l didn't realize it was so obvious.

438
00:32:10,742 --> 00:32:14,075
What you're gonna wanna do,
okay, is you tuck that thing

439
00:32:14,145 --> 00:32:17,205
into the side of your boxer shorts,
so it runs down the leg.

440
00:32:17,282 --> 00:32:19,477
That way you can contain it.

441
00:32:19,551 --> 00:32:22,418
lt's like getting a stiff rod
when you're taking a dump.

442
00:32:22,487 --> 00:32:23,613
A shit boner.

443
00:32:23,688 --> 00:32:26,452
Yeah. Then you got to jam it into the bowl
like it owes you money.

444
00:32:26,524 --> 00:32:30,460
But you don't want to dunk it.
lt's not a clown. Down!

445
00:32:30,528 --> 00:32:33,656
But you also don't want to
get the peepee on your shirt.

446
00:32:33,732 --> 00:32:35,723
lt's a no-win situation.

447
00:32:39,771 --> 00:32:43,571
At ease, gentlemen. Erections or otherwise.

448
00:32:44,109 --> 00:32:47,272
l remember similar conversations
with my men

449
00:32:47,746 --> 00:32:51,409
when we were tracking the towel-heads
to their <i>tariqs</i>

450
00:32:52,517 --> 00:32:56,419
Pitch-black little spider holes
no wider than a hula hoop.

451
00:32:56,988 --> 00:32:59,980
Like the Charlotte, the web.

452
00:33:00,825 --> 00:33:03,191
Do you understand what he's saying?

453
00:33:04,396 --> 00:33:07,559
Fear, Mr. Delacruz.
That's what l'm talking about. Fear.

454
00:33:09,701 --> 00:33:12,829
Fear is the middle name of war,
Mr. Delacruz.

455
00:33:13,138 --> 00:33:14,799
l learned that in the Storm.

456
00:33:14,873 --> 00:33:16,568
What is the Storm, sir?

457
00:33:18,877 --> 00:33:23,439
Two hundred and thirteen days in country.
Terrible heat.

458
00:33:24,115 --> 00:33:27,744
The sound of mortar fire day and night
ringing in your ears.

459
00:33:29,154 --> 00:33:31,486
The occasional dog exploding.

460
00:33:32,757 --> 00:33:34,349
But l used to lead men.

461
00:33:34,426 --> 00:33:37,054
Men that reminded me of you, Mr. Funke.

462
00:33:38,630 --> 00:33:40,359
On your feet, son.

463
00:33:44,302 --> 00:33:47,362
l want to thank you for your help
in getting those SATs back.

464
00:33:47,439 --> 00:33:49,703
Yeah, don't worry about it.

465
00:33:50,608 --> 00:33:54,305
-l'm sorry for being such a jerk-off.
-lt's okay.

466
00:33:54,379 --> 00:33:58,042
lf l ever catch you chewing that in class,
l'll kill you.

467
00:33:59,384 --> 00:34:02,182
-You read me?
-Like Cliff Notes, sir.

468
00:34:02,253 --> 00:34:05,552
Good. Go out there and have a good time.

469
00:34:21,773 --> 00:34:23,138
How's it feel?

470
00:34:23,208 --> 00:34:25,335
Like l just got punched in the mouth.

471
00:34:25,410 --> 00:34:29,141
My life is over now, dick!
l didn't steal those SATs!

472
00:34:29,681 --> 00:34:32,673
Then where were you
between 7:45 and 8:10 that night?

473
00:34:32,751 --> 00:34:36,152
Who the hell do you think you are?
lnspector Gadget?

474
00:34:36,521 --> 00:34:39,979
You really think l'd chance
everything for a test score?

475
00:34:40,625 --> 00:34:43,059
l'd already gotten into Cornell.

476
00:34:43,128 --> 00:34:45,358
Well, then why did you take
the SATs again?

477
00:34:45,430 --> 00:34:48,228
l just wanted to see if l could do better.

478
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:52,434
Man, you wouldn't know the truth
if it was staring you in the face.

479
00:35:01,112 --> 00:35:03,546
<i>Hello, Cornell Goodbye, motive</i>

480
00:35:04,282 --> 00:35:06,113
<i>I still thought Paul was an asshole,</i>

481
00:35:06,184 --> 00:35:09,881

<i>That sting wasn't my mouth</i>
<i>I was starting to doubt my story</i>

483
00:35:17,429 --> 00:35:21,024
Well done, Bobby.
You got into the Northwestern program.

484
00:35:24,702 --> 00:35:26,067
Wait, one more thing.

485
00:35:26,137 --> 00:35:28,264
Some grad student by the name of
Striedel will be in contact

486
00:35:28,339 --> 00:35:29,567
to fact-check the article.

487
00:35:29,641 --> 00:35:31,438
lt's just a formality.

488
00:35:31,509 --> 00:35:33,238

l'm going to need five minutes with Moore.

500
00:36:23,895 --> 00:36:25,419
You got three.

501
00:36:34,672 --> 00:36:37,163
Aren't you supposed to be in homeroom?

502
00:36:37,942 --> 00:36:39,432
Maybe l got to thinking.

503
00:36:39,511 --> 00:36:42,036
Maybe you should have done that sooner.

504
00:36:48,620 --> 00:36:50,315
Where were you that night?

505
00:36:50,388 --> 00:36:51,946
You think it's that easy?

506
00:36:52,023 --> 00:36:55,390
You think l can just tell you where l was
and it's gonna set it all straight?

507
00:36:55,460 --> 00:36:57,758
l mean, take a look around you, Funke!

508
00:36:57,829 --> 00:36:59,990
l'm screwed now no matter what l say.

509
00:37:00,064 --> 00:37:02,328
So then just tell me the truth.

510
00:37:07,805 --> 00:37:11,138
lf you didn't do it, l'm all you got.

511
00:37:12,043 --> 00:37:15,376
And you only got me
for one more minute, so spill it!

512
00:37:15,446 --> 00:37:16,708
Come on.

513
00:37:21,352 --> 00:37:24,014
Last year l did some things
on the basketball court

514
00:37:24,088 --> 00:37:26,249
l'm not exactly proud of.

515
00:37:26,491 --> 00:37:28,015
Like what?

516
00:37:28,326 --> 00:37:31,261
Shaving points. Twice last season.

517
00:37:31,930 --> 00:37:36,128
lt was two times too many.
l only did it because l needed the money.

518
00:37:37,702 --> 00:37:39,169
What for?

519
00:37:39,504 --> 00:37:41,131
lt doesn't matter.

520
00:37:41,205 --> 00:37:44,333
When l was approached this year,
l turned them down.

521
00:37:44,409 --> 00:37:46,309
We had a shot at State.

522
00:37:46,377 --> 00:37:49,005
l wasn't going to mess that up
for my senior year.

523
00:37:49,080 --> 00:37:53,574
So this person who approached you,
you think that he may have set you up?

524
00:37:54,452 --> 00:37:56,477
l don't know. Maybe.

525
00:38:04,929 --> 00:38:07,796
Give me his name. What's his name, Moore?

526
00:38:08,266 --> 00:38:11,702
Look, if you don't get cooperative,
l can't help you!

527
00:38:12,003 --> 00:38:13,300
You've got to give me his name, now!

528
00:38:13,371 --> 00:38:15,168
You got to start thinking with your head!

529
00:38:15,239 --> 00:38:17,298
You know the amount of power
that comes with the presidency!

530
00:38:17,375 --> 00:38:19,309
Everybody wants a piece of me!

531
00:38:19,377 --> 00:38:20,867
All right, time's up, Funke.

532
00:38:20,945 --> 00:38:23,675
You're getting the animals all riled up.

533
00:38:25,183 --> 00:38:27,151
What's his name, Moore?

534
00:38:27,585 --> 00:38:29,348
Look, l said time's up.

535
00:38:29,420 --> 00:38:31,684
-Give me his name.
-Come on. Come on.

536
00:38:31,756 --> 00:38:33,621
-What's his name?
-Freddy Bismark.

537
00:38:33,691 --> 00:38:36,091
Where do l find him? Moore!

538

<i>even the most elusive characters</i>

lt's freaky, isn't it?

558
00:39:39,123 --> 00:39:42,388
And apparently, they just got results
back from the ACTs.

559
00:39:42,460 --> 00:39:45,588
Some of our best and brightest bombed it.

560
00:39:45,663 --> 00:39:47,324
Really?

561
00:39:47,398 --> 00:39:49,992
You see Shamus Finnle over there?

562
00:39:51,102 --> 00:39:54,970
-His teeth are chattering.
-lt's probably from the Prylert.

00:39:55,173 --> 00:39:57,835
Really? l didn't know
that Shamus had ADD.

564

For a reporter, you're really out of the loop.

565

Half the school is taking Prylert right now,

566

or Axitol or Ripenol, maybe Faldox.

All just nice words for speed.

Shamus Finnle.

570
00:40:12,857 --> 00:40:14,825

Yes.

l will take... Yes, l'll a check!

But if it bounces, l'm coming after you.

Goodbye.

No more pledges.

590
00:42:09,774 --> 00:42:11,207
Suck it!

591
00:42:11,275 --> 00:42:13,004
Let me explain something to you.

592
00:42:13,077 --> 00:42:15,637
l don't know thing one about Paul Moore.

593
00:42:15,713 --> 00:42:18,045
His name means nothing to me.

594
00:42:18,416 --> 00:42:21,579
l have kids on over half the teams
on this district.

595
00:42:22,053 --> 00:42:25,489
And those pill poppers
are begging me to throw games.

596
00:42:25,957 --> 00:42:28,016
And if l had to go out
and personally frame each one

597
00:42:28,092 --> 00:42:29,684
that didn't want to brick a lay-up for me,

598
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:32,194
l wouldn't have time
to spend the money that l make.

599
00:42:32,263 --> 00:42:36,199
And as you can see,
l like spending the money that l make!

600
00:42:36,267 --> 00:42:40,499
l mean, look around.
That painting is from the 16th Chapel.

601
00:42:40,938 --> 00:42:42,963
That's the first chapel ever.

602
00:42:43,507 --> 00:42:45,065
So what was the money for?

603
00:42:45,142 --> 00:42:47,110
Oh, my God!
l'm going to slap you in the face.

604
00:42:47,178 --> 00:42:49,339
l don't know. He was having girl problems!

605
00:42:49,413 --> 00:42:50,471
What's that supposed to mean?

606
00:42:50,548 --> 00:42:53,176
He was having problems with girls. All right?

607
00:42:53,251 --> 00:42:55,310
Come on, for a fellow Friar.

608
00:42:55,386 --> 00:42:58,719
No! Not for a fellow Friar.
For you to get the fuck out of here!

609
00:42:58,789 --> 00:43:01,519
Okay. lt was some chick from Mc<i>K</i>inley.
That's all l know.

610
00:43:01,592 --> 00:43:03,822
Now, l'll see you, little man.

611
00:43:04,262 --> 00:43:05,889
Don't hurt yourselves.

612
00:43:10,668 --> 00:43:15,537
<i>If Freddy Bismark didn't frame Paul,</i>
<i>then maybe the girl problem was behind it</i>

613
00:43:16,774 --> 00:43:18,765
There's the old wise guy.

614
00:43:18,843 --> 00:43:19,935
Elliot.

615
00:43:20,011 --> 00:43:21,205
Those pubes come in yet?

616
00:43:21,279 --> 00:43:23,179
You still eating your mom's dirty tampons?

617
00:43:23,247 --> 00:43:24,236
<i>Only when I'm hungry</i>

618
00:43:24,515 --> 00:43:26,540
So as l was saying on the phone,

619
00:43:26,617 --> 00:43:29,450
l managed to implicate
our school president in a sordid theft

620
00:43:29,520 --> 00:43:32,546
and in the process steal his girlfriend.

621
00:43:32,623 --> 00:43:35,023
-So what's the problem?
-Bitch.

622
00:43:35,793 --> 00:43:38,455
l'm not so sure the guy did it anymore.

623
00:43:38,529 --> 00:43:41,089
Have you ever seen this guy around?

624
00:43:41,866 --> 00:43:45,358
Yeah, that's Valerie's boyfriend.
You're dating Valerie?

625
00:43:45,569 --> 00:43:47,161
The plot thickens, Elliot.

626
00:43:48,139 --> 00:43:49,936
l get it, peach fuzz.

627
00:43:50,007 --> 00:43:53,170
You think maybe l got tired
of being Paul's little plaything?

628
00:43:53,244 --> 00:43:56,270
Thought l'd teach him a lesson?
lt wasn't like that.

629
00:43:56,347 --> 00:43:57,712
What do you mean?

630
00:43:57,782 --> 00:44:01,843
Paul and l had something real, okay?
He could be himself around me.

631
00:44:02,353 --> 00:44:04,787
So what was the money for, then?

632
00:44:06,357 --> 00:44:07,984
That's got nothing to do with anything.

633
00:44:08,059 --> 00:44:10,050
Look, Valerie,

634
00:44:11,295 --> 00:44:14,731
if Paul's innocent,
then you can help him by helping me.

635
00:44:21,572 --> 00:44:22,732
Okay.

636
00:44:23,741 --> 00:44:27,006
Ready for the after-school special
they call my life?

637
00:44:27,078 --> 00:44:29,740
l owed money to some unpleasant people.

638
00:44:30,648 --> 00:44:33,481
They were ready to collect on me
as interest.

639
00:44:33,784 --> 00:44:37,948
Paul wouldn't stand for it.
Someone tells him about Freddy Bismark.

640
00:44:38,356 --> 00:44:40,620
Paul has two off nights.

641
00:44:41,092 --> 00:44:42,525
My debt goes away.

642
00:44:42,626 --> 00:44:44,856
Paul threw two games for you.

643
00:44:46,831 --> 00:44:50,528
He would've thrown the entire season
if l'd asked him to.

644
00:44:52,703 --> 00:44:54,637
<i>Valerie was another dead end</i>

645
00:44:54,705 --> 00:44:56,639
<i>If Paul was keeping her a secret,</i>

646
00:44:56,707 --> 00:44:59,540
<i>I wondered</i>
<i>what else he was holding back on</i>

647
00:45:18,129 --> 00:45:23,590
<i>I know that some of you kids know</i>
<i>that I fought in Desert Storm</i>

648
00:45:23,834 --> 00:45:25,631
<i>And you know why? I fought for you kids,</i>

649
00:45:25,703 --> 00:45:27,933
<i>and I fought for this country</i>
<i>and this school!</i>

650
00:45:28,005 --> 00:45:29,768
<i>For St Donovan's!</i>

651
00:45:30,241 --> 00:45:31,708
<i>It's no joke!</i>

652
00:45:33,210 --> 00:45:35,201
<i>Sometimes, I don't know,</i>
<i>I can get carried away,</i>

653
00:45:35,279 --> 00:45:38,271
<i>but I wrote this song last night</i>
<i>and I want you to sing it with me</i>

654
00:45:38,349 --> 00:45:41,512
<i>If you want, you can sing it,</i>
<i>you can march, yeah!</i>

655
00:45:41,585 --> 00:45:43,678
<i>Come on, kids, sing it with me!</i>

656
00:45:50,061 --> 00:45:51,722
What's going on?

657
00:45:51,796 --> 00:45:53,991
<i>K</i>irkpatrick's on some school-spirit rampage.

658
00:45:54,598 --> 00:45:57,465
He canceled a.m. classes
to have a pep rally.

659
00:45:58,903 --> 00:46:00,632
<i>Merci, K</i>irkpatrick.

660
00:46:08,479 --> 00:46:12,006
<i>You can sing if you want</i>
<i>You can march if you want!</i>

661
00:46:31,402 --> 00:46:32,562
Moore.

662
00:46:44,348 --> 00:46:46,407
<i>And on that note, St Donovan's</i>

663
00:46:48,452 --> 00:46:50,283
<i>Marlon Piazza</i>

664
00:47:04,568 --> 00:47:07,765
<i>For far too long</i>
<i>we have stood as a school divided</i>

665
00:47:07,838 --> 00:47:10,102
<i>Today let us stand together</i>

666
00:47:15,179 --> 00:47:17,545
<i>Let us create a better tomorrow</i>

667
00:47:18,315 --> 00:47:21,978
<i>As I stand here today</i>
<i>I don't see freshman or sophomores</i>

668
00:47:32,329 --> 00:47:34,024
<i>I see Friars!</i>

669
00:47:45,342 --> 00:47:47,401
Marlon, can you hear me?

670
00:47:47,478 --> 00:47:49,742
lt's a paintball, you pussy!

671
00:47:56,754 --> 00:47:59,086
This way! This way, children!

672
00:48:00,691 --> 00:48:03,057
l'm hit! l'm hit!

673
00:48:13,537 --> 00:48:14,765
Moore!

674
00:48:38,362 --> 00:48:41,490
l'm going to go to the vending machine
for some pretzels.

675
00:48:41,565 --> 00:48:44,227
Do you want anything from downstairs?

676
00:48:44,301 --> 00:48:46,269
How about a bandage?

677
00:48:51,075 --> 00:48:52,474
Forget it.

678
00:49:07,891 --> 00:49:09,051
Nurse Platt's phone.

679
00:49:09,126 --> 00:49:11,060
<i>Just got word your boy shot some kids</i>

680
00:49:11,128 --> 00:49:13,926
<i>How does that sit with the facts</i>
<i>of your story, I'd like to ask, Funke?</i>

681
00:49:13,998 --> 00:49:16,865
Striedel, how the hell did you...

682
00:49:16,934 --> 00:49:18,162
<i>I have not Yes, yes</i>

683
00:49:18,235 --> 00:49:20,760
<i>I have not received your notes</i>
<i>on the story, boss</i>

684
00:49:20,838 --> 00:49:24,706
Well, yeah, l know l've been
doing some backtracking to,

685
00:49:24,775 --> 00:49:26,140
you know, locate everything.

686
00:49:26,210 --> 00:49:28,508
<i>Backtracking, huh?</i>
<i>There was a kid a few years back,</i>

687
00:49:28,579 --> 00:49:30,046
<i>said he was doing some backtracking</i>

688
00:49:30,114 --> 00:49:32,674
<i>Turned out he fabricated the whole story</i>
<i>to get into the program</i>

689
00:49:32,750 --> 00:49:35,412
<i>They kicked him out, of course</i>
<i>Blackballed him</i>

690
00:49:35,486 --> 00:49:37,545
<i>Last I heard he was working</i>
<i>as a pharmaceutical test subject</i>

691
00:49:37,621 --> 00:49:39,248
<i>for carpal tunnel syndrome</i>

692
00:49:39,323 --> 00:49:40,585
<i>Your story's thin, kid</i>

693
00:49:40,658 --> 00:49:43,218
<i>Do you really think</i>
<i>you can pull one over on Ben Striedel?</i>

694
00:49:43,294 --> 00:49:45,285
<i>I want your notes, stat</i>

695
00:49:52,503 --> 00:49:53,731
Hey.

696
00:49:55,739 --> 00:49:58,867
There's something that l need to tell you.

697
00:49:58,942 --> 00:50:01,410
Not before l get to say thank you.

698
00:50:02,413 --> 00:50:03,744
For what?

699
00:50:03,814 --> 00:50:06,009
For saving my life out there.

700
00:50:07,751 --> 00:50:10,242
lt was just a paintball gun.

701
00:50:10,321 --> 00:50:12,448
Yeah, but you didn't know that, did you?

702
00:50:12,523 --> 00:50:15,981
Look, Francesca, as an ethical journalist

703
00:50:16,060 --> 00:50:19,427
and a man who's dedicated to the truth,

704
00:50:20,130 --> 00:50:23,896
l think you should know
that your boyfriend was probably...

705
00:50:29,606 --> 00:50:31,631
He's not my boyfriend.

706
00:50:33,310 --> 00:50:35,403
Now what did you want to tell me?

707
00:50:49,059 --> 00:50:51,721
That was nice shooting out there, Mr. Moore.

708
00:50:51,795 --> 00:50:55,424
Another three inches to the left
and you would have had a kill shot on me.

709
00:50:55,499 --> 00:50:59,697
You got this all wrong.
l didn't steal the SATs.

710
00:51:01,739 --> 00:51:03,138
Anything else?

711
00:51:03,207 --> 00:51:05,675
Yeah. This place sucks!

712
00:51:07,611 --> 00:51:10,478
You'll be sucking soon enough, Mr. Moore.

713
00:51:17,688 --> 00:51:21,146
<i>They locked Paul away at some</i>
<i>undisclosed private institution</i>

714
00:51:22,092 --> 00:51:25,687
<i>My story put him there</i>
<i>Now it was my job to get him out</i>

715
00:51:31,068 --> 00:51:32,403
l'll tell you whatever you want to know.

716
00:51:56,560 --> 00:51:58,619
Meds, three times a day.

717
00:52:01,832 --> 00:52:02,958
PMW.

718
00:52:06,437 --> 00:52:07,995
Paul Moore way.

719
00:52:09,039 --> 00:52:11,166
Paul, l need your help.

720
00:52:11,875 --> 00:52:15,072
l know someone framed you
for stealing the SATs,

721
00:52:17,414 --> 00:52:21,043
but l just don't know who.
Who do you think framed you?

722
00:52:21,585 --> 00:52:23,985
Who set you up? Come on, Paul.

723
00:52:26,557 --> 00:52:28,616
Are you here to take me home?

724
00:52:32,830 --> 00:52:35,458
<i>After three hours,</i>
<i>the only thing I got out of Paul</i>

725
00:52:35,566 --> 00:52:37,830
<i>was a sinking feeling in my stomach</i>

726
00:52:38,302 --> 00:52:43,103
All right, Mitch, we're looking for weapons,
obviously, anything that can kill a student.

727
00:52:43,173 --> 00:52:46,870
<i>K</i>nives, guns. But it's not always obvious.

728
00:52:47,277 --> 00:52:50,041
Are you kidding me?
You know the rule about gum!

729
00:52:50,113 --> 00:52:53,378
Raise your arms, please. With the women,
you want to use the backs of the hands.

730
00:52:53,450 --> 00:52:55,816
The backs of the hands, Mitch.

731
00:52:55,953 --> 00:52:58,444
Last rule. Most important rule.

732
00:52:58,522 --> 00:52:59,921
You're gonna wanna fuck them.

733
00:52:59,990 --> 00:53:02,891
Do not fuck the students,
do you understand?

734
00:53:04,962 --> 00:53:06,657
<i>The scene of the crime</i>

735
00:53:06,730 --> 00:53:10,359
<i>Give a lunatic a paintball gun</i>
<i>and you'd expect a Jackson Pollock</i>

736
00:53:10,434 --> 00:53:12,425
<i>But Paul was more precise</i>

737
00:53:12,870 --> 00:53:15,338
<i>Every shot counted But for what?</i>

738
00:53:15,405 --> 00:53:18,499
<i>Francesca? That's easy She broke his heart</i>

739
00:53:18,575 --> 00:53:20,566
<i>Me? I broke the story</i>

740
00:53:20,644 --> 00:53:22,669
<i>Kirkpatrick? Mercy killing</i>

741
00:53:22,746 --> 00:53:25,647
<i>But what about Alex Schneider,</i>
<i>the school treasurer?</i>

742
00:53:25,716 --> 00:53:27,513
<i>What about Marlon and the Mullens?</i>

743
00:53:27,584 --> 00:53:30,519
<i>They were his friends</i>
<i>and fellow members of the student council</i>

744
00:53:30,587 --> 00:53:34,717
<i>If Paul's painting meant something,</i>
<i>maybe those guys could explain it to me</i>

745
00:53:34,791 --> 00:53:37,783
Yo, check it out,
it's that slut Laura Hoffner.

746
00:53:37,861 --> 00:53:40,421
Dude, you don't even
want to know what l did to that ass!

747
00:53:40,497 --> 00:53:43,591
Probably the same thing
l did to your mom's ass.

748
00:53:44,568 --> 00:53:47,059
Dude, that's Mom. Our mom.

749
00:53:49,106 --> 00:53:50,198
Yeah.

750
00:53:50,541 --> 00:53:54,443
Yo, yo, check it out. l got this move
that l like to call the operator, right?

751
00:53:54,511 --> 00:53:56,638
lt's when l'm railing a girl,

752
00:53:56,713 --> 00:53:58,704
and then l reach down
and steal her cell phone

753
00:53:58,782 --> 00:54:01,979
and l call up her dad so he can listen
to me do her.

754
00:54:02,052 --> 00:54:05,488
-Yeah, Daddy. Yes...
-Father's very special.

755
00:54:08,258 --> 00:54:09,919
Are you lost, freshman?

756
00:54:11,628 --> 00:54:13,061
Why did he shoot you, Marlon?

757
00:54:13,130 --> 00:54:14,222
He shot you, too, didn't he?

758
00:54:14,298 --> 00:54:15,424
Yeah. Well, he shot you first.

759
00:54:15,499 --> 00:54:19,162
Hey, you want detention
for the rest of your life, fuck face?

760
00:54:19,236 --> 00:54:22,296
Hey, Funke, why don't you...
Why don't you come to my house on Friday?

761
00:54:22,372 --> 00:54:23,498
l'm gonna have a little party.

762
00:54:23,574 --> 00:54:24,563
No, dude. Come on.

763
00:54:24,641 --> 00:54:27,940
lt's okay. l mean, he just wants
to ask me some questions, right?

764
00:54:28,011 --> 00:54:30,172
For the school paper.

So this is a party.

769
00:55:18,829 --> 00:55:20,990
Yeah, well, you knew enough
to be fashionably late.

770
00:55:21,064 --> 00:55:23,760
Well, no, actually l had a flat tire, so...

771
00:55:24,034 --> 00:55:26,798
Twenty bucks says that toothpaste
doesn't do a goddamn thing.

772

l'll fucking smoke it myself.

Smoke what you got, man.

774

You want a beer?

775
00:55:31,642 --> 00:55:35,578
Well, actually l have to get up early
for my driver's test. Okay.

776

-Shit! No!
-Okay, man.

780
00:56:00,671 --> 00:56:02,832
Hey, Marlon, you and Paul Moore

781

for two years.

-Yeah?

lt's a party.

785
00:56:12,182 --> 00:56:14,776
Yeah, Funke,
you can put this on the record, okay?

786
00:56:18,588 --> 00:56:20,078
Tastes minty.

787

Tastes like a joint, you fags!

790

791
00:56:34,471 --> 00:56:36,939
Come on, Funke,
give me your best shot.

792
00:56:54,558 --> 00:56:55,923

-Take him upstairs.

Take it. Take it like a man.

803
00:58:36,326 --> 00:58:40,353

to a seminar on surveillance technology.

He's totally gaga for that cum-dumpster.

-Think about it.

The real question is,
what are you doing here?

808

l'm just... l'm doing research
for the school paper.

809

on Francesca's pink beav.

No, seriously.

You need to sink the pink tonight, <i>hermano</i>

A premie?

815
00:59:18,969 --> 00:59:20,334
Word gets around.

816

821
00:59:40,590 --> 00:59:42,922
-Well, l got to get back.
-To do the story.

-Right.

about a follow-up to your story.

830
01:00:04,080 --> 01:00:08,244
l was thinking like maybe an editorial piece
on the student council or something.

-Clara.
-Yeah?

Yeah, well, somebody
already passed out in my bed.

835
01:00:30,307 --> 01:00:33,572
Well, then won't he mind that we're in here?

836
01:00:33,643 --> 01:00:35,235
He doesn't care.

840
01:00:58,101 --> 01:00:59,398
A good one.

841

Hey, l like you.

842
01:01:03,940 --> 01:01:07,899
l like the way you look at me.
Like it's for real, you know?

843
01:01:10,046 --> 01:01:12,606
Like you don't have to impress anyone.

844

you'd still look at me the way you do.

846
01:01:26,296 --> 01:01:28,025
You get me, Funke.

847
01:01:30,033 --> 01:01:33,332
l tried on, like, 1 1 shirts
before l came over here.

848
01:01:34,871 --> 01:01:37,772
Yeah? Well, you know, l don't like it.

What about your mom?

853

855

920
01:08:22,779 --> 01:08:26,681
You know what, Funke? You're right.

921
01:08:35,425 --> 01:08:38,758
Try not to get blood on the carpet.
My mom will get pissed.

922
01:09:00,883 --> 01:09:04,250
Francesca, hey, pick up.
l need to talk to you about Paul.

923
01:09:04,320 --> 01:09:06,584
Did he ever mention anything about

924
01:09:06,656 --> 01:09:09,420
Schneider or the Mullens
having a drug problem?

925
01:09:09,492 --> 01:09:11,153
Anyway, l'll try you again later.

926
01:09:11,227 --> 01:09:15,493
Okay. l love you.
l mean, l love hanging out with you.

927
01:09:16,399 --> 01:09:18,196
<i>Oh, Gertrude</i>

01:09:36,853 --> 01:09:38,684
Hey, what's going on?

931
01:09:39,622 --> 01:09:41,214
Didn't you hear?

932
01:09:42,325 --> 01:09:43,519
No.

933
01:09:47,063 --> 01:09:49,588
Here, here, breathe that in, Funke.

934
01:09:51,534 --> 01:09:55,334
<i>The big news was that everyone</i>
<i>had to retake the SATs</i>

935
01:09:55,404 --> 01:09:59,238
<i>The stolen tests had been nullified</i>
<i>under suspicion of tampering</i>

936
01:09:59,308 --> 01:10:01,572
<i>But I had my own suspicions to follow</i>

937
01:10:01,644 --> 01:10:03,874
<i>I needed to stay on their tail</i>

938
01:10:03,946 --> 01:10:06,676
<i>I needed evidence I needed photos</i>
<i>I needed</i>

939

Hey, stinky.

940
01:10:08,784 --> 01:10:11,446
l think you need to come home with me.

941
01:10:14,590 --> 01:10:18,185
You know, l'm concerned about the lack
of parental supervision at your house.

942
01:10:18,261 --> 01:10:20,786
Yeah? You want to be my daddy?

943
01:10:36,479 --> 01:10:38,276
ls that a good look?

944
01:10:38,648 --> 01:10:40,673
You're like a cool dinosaur.

945
01:10:56,332 --> 01:10:58,323
l can't see anything right now.

946
01:10:59,068 --> 01:11:00,831
l'm totally blind.

947
01:11:02,939 --> 01:11:05,533
<i>Paul, the Northwestern program</i>

948
01:11:06,609 --> 01:11:08,941
<i>Suddenly none of it seemed to matter</i>

949
01:11:09,011 --> 01:11:13,004
<i>The hole in my side, the one</i>
<i>that always kept me hungry, was gone</i>

950
01:11:14,517 --> 01:11:16,781
<i>Guess that meant I was happy</i>

951
01:11:29,899 --> 01:11:31,560
You shouldn't have done that.

952
01:11:32,335 --> 01:11:34,633
<i>''Funke, frosh,</i>

<i>One thing was clear,</i>
<i>Tad Goltz couldn't write for shit</i>

956
01:11:43,446 --> 01:11:46,244
-What the hell is this!
-You tell me.

957
01:11:46,782 --> 01:11:48,113
There's no way that story checks out!

958
01:11:48,184 --> 01:11:50,243
Schneider has been cooking the books!

959
01:11:50,319 --> 01:11:52,253
What does that have to do with Paul Moore?

960
01:11:52,321 --> 01:11:55,051
Nothing, but maybe Moore had nothing to do
with the SATs

961
01:11:55,124 --> 01:11:56,819
-in the first place.
-Bobby, just stop.

962
01:11:57,159 --> 01:11:58,888
l really believed in you.

963
01:11:58,961 --> 01:12:00,656
And l thought that you were
one of the few kids in school

964
01:12:00,730 --> 01:12:03,221
that didn't need to be popular.

965
01:12:05,534 --> 01:12:09,026
l'm recommending that Tad
get your summer scholarship.

966
01:12:10,473 --> 01:12:11,735
What?

967
01:12:12,508 --> 01:12:14,499
l'm late for AP English.

968
01:12:28,024 --> 01:12:30,117
Smooth move, Doctor Love.

969
01:12:31,227 --> 01:12:33,661
You actually think
l went to all the trouble of stealing

970
01:12:33,729 --> 01:12:35,822
the SATs just so l could go out
with Francesca?

971
01:12:35,898 --> 01:12:37,160
l would.

972
01:12:38,234 --> 01:12:41,101
Francesca and l are in love, Cipriato.

973
01:12:41,170 --> 01:12:44,196
Maybe that's something
you can't emotionally comprehend yet.

974
01:12:45,207 --> 01:12:46,367
Asshole!

975
01:12:47,543 --> 01:12:49,807
Francesca. Francesca, it's not true.

976
01:12:49,879 --> 01:12:51,107
Goltz is full of shit!

977
01:12:51,180 --> 01:12:53,478
Did Paul steal them or not?

978
01:12:53,549 --> 01:12:55,744
Well, l don't think so, but that's not...

979
01:12:55,818 --> 01:12:56,944
l trusted you, Funke.

980
01:12:57,019 --> 01:12:59,010
This is bigger than me and you. Okay?

981
01:12:59,088 --> 01:13:01,113
This is bigger than Paul Moore. This is...

982
01:13:03,059 --> 01:13:04,458
Francesca.

983
01:13:05,194 --> 01:13:07,924
Francesca, look,
you got to believe me, okay?

984
01:13:13,269 --> 01:13:15,430
Can l just get the hall pass?

985
01:13:17,139 --> 01:13:18,697
The hall pass.

986
01:13:21,677 --> 01:13:23,770
l got to talk to some people.

987
01:13:30,352 --> 01:13:31,910
Could l just get the hall pass, please?

988
01:13:31,987 --> 01:13:33,716
No, sit down.

989
01:13:34,690 --> 01:13:36,817
-Please, l need...
-Sit down.

990
01:13:54,977 --> 01:13:56,604

991
01:13:58,914 --> 01:14:00,973
<i>Porque no</i> 'Cause l'm the only one

993
01:14:10,059 --> 01:14:12,584
Yeah, well, <i>no me gusta</i> any of this bullshit!

994
01:14:26,709 --> 01:14:28,370
Thank God you got me out of there.

995
01:14:28,444 --> 01:14:31,607
You wouldn't believe some of the stuff
that l've uncovered.

996
01:14:31,680 --> 01:14:33,773
l don't even know where to start.

997
01:14:33,849 --> 01:14:35,840
Point shaving, theft, embezzling.

998
01:14:35,918 --> 01:14:37,215
A pharmaceutical drug ring.

999
01:14:37,286 --> 01:14:39,846
-ls that gum in your mouth?
-There's these pills, right?

1000
01:14:39,922 --> 01:14:43,323
-Half the school...
-l just asked you, are you chewing gum?

1001
01:14:44,493 --> 01:14:46,358
That's... That's irrelevant.

1002
01:14:46,428 --> 01:14:48,396
l think there's something
really serious going on here.

1003
01:14:48,464 --> 01:14:52,059
You seem to be a little foggy
as to why l'm here, Mr. Funke.

1004
01:14:52,134 --> 01:14:55,570
From what l understand, you've made
a mockery of this entire high school.

1005
01:14:55,638 --> 01:14:58,106
You seem to think
that this is some kind of circus

1006
01:14:58,174 --> 01:15:00,608
and that l am some kind of clown.

1007
01:15:00,676 --> 01:15:02,610
l'm not an effing clown.

1008
01:15:03,012 --> 01:15:05,378
And l'm not here to bring joy

1009
01:15:05,447 --> 01:15:09,884
and love and light and laughter
into your effing heart!

1010
01:15:10,920 --> 01:15:13,616
Now l'm going to ask you one more time.

1011
01:15:14,290 --> 01:15:16,758
And this time l expect an answer.

1012
01:15:18,160 --> 01:15:19,286
ls

1013
01:15:20,329 --> 01:15:21,557

1014
01:15:22,498 --> 01:15:23,726
gum

1015
01:15:24,667 --> 01:15:28,899
in your mouth?

1016
01:15:30,906 --> 01:15:32,965
ls this gum in my mouth?

1017
01:15:35,144 --> 01:15:39,877
ls this gum in my mouth?
Yeah, it is, actually. lt's gum.

1018
01:15:39,949 --> 01:15:43,476
lt's gum. lt's gum! lt's gum! lt's gum!
lt's gum! lt's gum!

1019
01:15:43,552 --> 01:15:47,784
l chew it all the time, 24<i>l</i>7.
l've got a fucking jumbo pack

1020
01:15:47,857 --> 01:15:49,757
in my pocket right now!

1021
01:15:49,825 --> 01:15:54,694
My locker, filled to the brim with gum!
No books, just gum!

1022
01:15:54,763 --> 01:15:56,390
Now l am trying to talk to you

1023
01:15:56,465 --> 01:15:58,262
about matters
of the utmost importance here,

1024
01:15:58,334 --> 01:16:00,859
and you're talking to me about gum?

1025
01:16:26,228 --> 01:16:28,788
Bathroom breaks, you get one.
Right after lunch.

1026
01:16:28,864 --> 01:16:30,923
Bring your work in first thing in the morning,

1027
01:16:31,000 --> 01:16:32,968
which means you can get it done
by the end of third period.

1028
01:16:33,035 --> 01:16:34,662
Which is nice because
it gives you the rest of the day

1029
01:16:34,737 --> 01:16:36,136
to pretty much do whatever.

1030
01:16:36,605 --> 01:16:39,631
You get 15 minutes in the yard,
twice a week.

1031
01:16:40,342 --> 01:16:43,368
Mind and body, Funke, mind and body.

1032
01:16:50,352 --> 01:16:52,877
What should l do about Francesca?

1033
01:16:52,955 --> 01:16:55,856
Get some good porn and pray that she calls.

1034
01:17:17,546 --> 01:17:19,571
-Hello?
<i>-Hello, dickhead</i>

1035
01:17:20,950 --> 01:17:22,110
You have got to be kidding me.

1036

<i>Did you?</i>

1040

<i>I have a 175 IQ</i>
<i>That means I skipped the third grade</i>

You don't understand, Striedel.
l was framed.

1042
01:17:36,732 --> 01:17:39,997
The school treasurer is moving
money around to sell drugs.

1043
01:17:40,069 --> 01:17:43,300
<i>That's rich Now you're going to</i>
<i>frame the treasurer?</i>

1044
01:17:43,372 --> 01:17:44,896
<i>Is the class secretary next?</i>

1045
01:17:44,974 --> 01:17:46,373
<i>What's the money got to do</i>
<i>with stolen SATs?</i>

1046
01:17:46,442 --> 01:17:48,933
Nothing.
They're two completely separate things.

1047

<i>Let me give you a freebie, kid</i>

1052
01:18:15,704 --> 01:18:16,693
Time out?

1053
01:18:17,306 --> 01:18:18,830
That was good.

l told you putting it in there was a bad idea.

1057
01:18:26,949 --> 01:18:29,941
Really, Stinky Landy?
l put it where you wanna put it.

1058
01:18:30,019 --> 01:18:32,249
That's nice. ls it new?

1059
01:18:32,321 --> 01:18:34,118
No, it's my mom's.

1060
01:18:34,423 --> 01:18:35,981
Well, connect the dots.

1061

just use your library voices.

1064

Sorry, l'm just trying to think.

1065
01:18:47,336 --> 01:18:49,361
You can't let Goltz get
one up on you, Funke.

1066
01:18:49,438 --> 01:18:51,872
That guy is an enormous vagina.

Funke, where you go?

1071
01:19:18,367 --> 01:19:22,565
These four walls.
You just stay, bounce... Like a pinball.

1072
01:19:22,638 --> 01:19:24,697
That's it. You can't run.

1073
01:19:31,713 --> 01:19:33,305
Hey, hall monitor!

1074
01:20:11,553 --> 01:20:12,850
Francesca?

1075
01:20:21,630 --> 01:20:22,961
Francesca?

1076
01:20:26,168 --> 01:20:27,601
Francesca?

1077
01:20:56,265 --> 01:20:58,529
<i>Mathematically, it's a percentage of your life</i>

1078
01:20:58,600 --> 01:21:02,661
<i>Four years, 48 months, 1,461 days</i>

1079
01:21:03,272 --> 01:21:06,332
<i>High school is prom, football games,</i>
<i>boyfriends, girlfriends,</i>

1080
01:21:06,408 --> 01:21:10,367
<i>party at the rich kid's house</i>
<i>Fun, simple, wholesome</i>

1081
01:21:11,113 --> 01:21:13,172
<i>But it's really anything but</i>

1082
01:21:13,248 --> 01:21:15,876
<i>High school might be</i>
<i>the least wholesome four years of your life</i>

1083
01:21:15,951 --> 01:21:18,647
<i>And there's nothing simple about it</i>

1084
01:21:19,221 --> 01:21:22,088
<i>High school is ugly, hard and complicated</i>

1085
01:21:22,157 --> 01:21:25,923
<i>As complicated as a conspiracy</i>
<i>to assassinate the president</i>

1086
01:21:26,328 --> 01:21:28,888
<i>A conspiracy about to be uncovered</i>

1087
01:21:59,127 --> 01:22:00,754
<i>Alex Schneider and the Mullen brothers</i>

1088
01:22:00,829 --> 01:22:04,526
<i>had been selling prescription drugs</i>
<i>since their sophomore year</i>

1089
01:22:04,600 --> 01:22:08,730
<i>The Mullens' dad was an orthopedist</i>
<i>with a habit of boning his patients</i>

1090
01:22:08,804 --> 01:22:11,932
<i>When he split with one of them,</i>
<i>the hip doctor left his family his van</i>

1091
01:22:12,007 --> 01:22:14,271
<i>and a box of prescription pads</i>

1092
01:22:14,343 --> 01:22:17,107
<i>The brothers made due</i>
<i>with their inheritance</i>

1093
01:22:19,881 --> 01:22:22,475
<i>But the Mullens weren't competent enough</i>
<i>to run things on their own</i>

1094
01:22:22,551 --> 01:22:23,677
Yo, shit biscuit!

1095
01:22:23,752 --> 01:22:26,846
These bottles aren't going to fill themselves.

1096
01:22:27,522 --> 01:22:30,491
<i>Initially, the market for</i>
<i>academic performance enhancers</i>

1097
01:22:30,559 --> 01:22:32,891
<i>wasn't as ripe as they'd hoped</i>

1098
01:22:33,095 --> 01:22:36,326
<i>So like good businessmen,</i>
<i>they created a demand</i>

1099
01:22:37,699 --> 01:22:39,690
<i>They sabotaged tests throughout the school,</i>

1100
01:22:39,768 --> 01:22:43,670
<i>targeting the students</i>
<i>they knew would fold from the pressure</i>

1101
01:22:44,039 --> 01:22:47,873
<i>If you erase enough bubbles,</i>
<i>you can erase a kid's future</i>

1102
01:22:47,943 --> 01:22:49,774
Supply and demand, son.

1103
01:22:49,845 --> 01:22:51,210
<i>Business boomed</i>

1104
01:22:51,980 --> 01:22:55,143
<i>So much so that they started</i>
<i>dipping into student council funds</i>

1105
01:22:55,217 --> 01:22:57,412
<i>to use as venture capital</i>

1106
01:22:58,153 --> 01:23:01,247
<i>P Moore wasn't exactly Alan Greenspan,</i>

1107
01:23:01,323 --> 01:23:03,655
<i>but it didn't take</i>
<i>an economic genius to figure out</i>

1108
01:23:03,725 --> 01:23:07,684
<i>that hundreds of dollars</i>
<i>were being shifted around weekly</i>

1109
01:23:07,763 --> 01:23:09,754
<i>Paul told Marlon what he'd discovered,</i>

1110
01:23:09,831 --> 01:23:13,062
<i>said he was going to put the kibosh</i>
<i>on Alex's creative accounting</i>

1111
01:23:13,135 --> 01:23:14,932
<i>Marlon couldn't have that</i>

1112
01:23:15,003 --> 01:23:19,030
<i>Things were too good He had big plans</i>
<i>and the president was in the way</i>

1113
01:23:22,944 --> 01:23:25,310
<i>He needed Paul out of the picture</i>

1114
01:23:45,434 --> 01:23:46,765
What's going on, guys?

1115
01:23:46,835 --> 01:23:48,132
Funke...

1116
01:23:49,371 --> 01:23:52,465
You just don't know when to quit, do you?

1117
01:23:52,541 --> 01:23:55,135
Guess not. Gum?

1118
01:23:59,181 --> 01:24:02,912
Changing the answers on the SATs
so you can sell more drugs.

1119
01:24:02,984 --> 01:24:07,318
lt's clever, Marlon.
Twisted, but clever nonetheless.

1120
01:24:08,223 --> 01:24:10,783
Should make for a great story.

1121
01:24:10,859 --> 01:24:14,351
Bad move, Funke.
Open that window and bring him over.

1122
01:24:22,104 --> 01:24:23,765
Okay, here's the real story.

1123
01:24:23,839 --> 01:24:25,739
Bobby Funke made a few bad decisions,

1124
01:24:25,807 --> 01:24:28,298
lost his girlfriend,
and up and jumped out the window.

1125
01:24:28,377 --> 01:24:29,776
Just another tormented freshman.

1126
01:24:29,845 --> 01:24:31,745
l'm a sophomore, dick!

1127
01:24:33,782 --> 01:24:35,545
Throw his ass out.

1128
01:24:36,318 --> 01:24:38,912
-You won't do it.
-l won't?

1129
01:24:38,987 --> 01:24:40,511
These sorts of things happen all the time.

1130
01:24:40,589 --> 01:24:43,615
There's a lot of pressure
here at St. Donovan's!

1131
01:24:44,159 --> 01:24:45,524
Throw him out!

1132
01:24:47,362 --> 01:24:49,626
Fine, l'll do it myself.

1133
01:24:49,698 --> 01:24:51,632
Hey! Let him go!

1134
01:24:54,236 --> 01:24:56,431
Put him down! Delicately.

1135
01:24:56,505 --> 01:24:58,029
How the hell did they know you were here?

1136
01:24:58,106 --> 01:25:00,472
l might have made an announcement.

1137
01:25:16,691 --> 01:25:17,953
Funke.

1138
01:25:20,862 --> 01:25:23,888
<i>Bob Woodward once said</i>
<i>that the first rule of good journalism</i>

1139
01:25:23,965 --> 01:25:27,332
<i>is never reveal the story</i>
<i>before it goes to print</i>

1140
01:25:27,402 --> 01:25:30,701
<i>But Woodward wasn't in love</i>
<i>with Francesca Fachini</i>

1141
01:25:31,106 --> 01:25:35,566
<i>Before I cleared my name with the school,</i>
<i>I had to clear it with her</i>

1142
01:25:36,678 --> 01:25:39,374
<i>I had to tell her I'd figured it all out</i>

1143
01:25:46,154 --> 01:25:48,281
<i>Turns out, I hadn't</i>

1144
01:26:00,268 --> 01:26:02,395
<i>You played me, Francesca</i>

1145
01:26:04,272 --> 01:26:06,069
<i>You played Paul</i>

1146
01:26:08,009 --> 01:26:10,443
You played the whole damn school.

1147
01:26:11,379 --> 01:26:13,643
Look out! Look out! Look out!

1148
01:26:13,982 --> 01:26:16,974
l need everybody to file out of this office.

1149
01:26:17,319 --> 01:26:20,117
Everybody except you five.

1150
01:26:20,188 --> 01:26:23,180
The five of you are in big fucking trouble!

1151
01:26:23,725 --> 01:26:27,252
Stay right here, get out of my way!
You, too, bonehead.

1152
01:26:28,263 --> 01:26:30,891
You'll never understand why l did it.

1153
01:26:35,036 --> 01:26:37,470
Nobody's misunderstood, Francesca.

1154
01:26:38,206 --> 01:26:41,903
lt's just what people say
when they don't like who they are.

1155
01:26:46,181 --> 01:26:47,808
Bobby, wait.

1156
01:26:52,454 --> 01:26:55,423
Forget it, Funke. lt's high school.
