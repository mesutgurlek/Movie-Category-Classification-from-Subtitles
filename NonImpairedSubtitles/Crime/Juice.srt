1
00:00:30,988 --> 00:00:33,548
No

2
00:00:33,624 --> 00:00:35,615
No

3
00:00:35,693 --> 00:00:37,854
No

4
00:00:37,928 --> 00:00:39,293
No

5
00:00:39,363 --> 00:00:41,126
No

6
00:00:41,198 --> 00:00:43,132
Sip the juice

7
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:44,792
I got enough
to go around

8
00:00:44,869 --> 00:00:46,860
And the thought
takes place uptown

9
00:00:46,937 --> 00:00:47,995
I grew up
on a sidewalk

10
00:00:48,072 --> 00:00:49,300
Where I learned
street talk

11
00:00:49,373 --> 00:00:50,806
And then taught
to hawk New York

12
00:00:50,875 --> 00:00:52,866
I go to Queens for queens
to get the crew from Brooklyn

13
00:00:52,943 --> 00:00:55,173
Make money in Manhattan
and never been took in

14
00:00:55,246 --> 00:00:56,804
Go uptown to the Bronx
and boogie down

15
00:00:56,881 --> 00:00:59,145
Get strong on the island,
recoup and lay around

16
00:00:59,216 --> 00:01:01,116
Time to build
my juice back up

17
00:01:01,185 --> 00:01:02,243
Props stack up

18
00:01:02,319 --> 00:01:03,251
Suckers get smacked up

19
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:04,252
Don't doubt
the clout

20
00:01:04,321 --> 00:01:05,583
You know
what I'm about

21
00:01:05,656 --> 00:01:06,987
Knockin' niggers off,
knockin' niggers out

22
00:01:07,057 --> 00:01:09,582
Shakin' 'em up,
wakin' 'em up

23
00:01:09,660 --> 00:01:11,594
Rakin' 'em up,
breakin' 'em up

24
00:01:11,662 --> 00:01:13,994
Standin' on shaky ground,
too close to the edge

25
00:01:14,064 --> 00:01:15,691
Let's see if I know
the ledge

26
00:01:24,208 --> 00:01:25,937
The corner's triflin',
'cause Shorty's here

27
00:01:26,010 --> 00:01:28,274
I get cocked liftin'
40s of beer

28
00:01:28,345 --> 00:01:30,245
Here's a sip for
the crew that's deceased

29
00:01:30,314 --> 00:01:32,839
If I get revenge,
then they rest in peace

30
00:01:32,917 --> 00:01:33,941
Somebody gotta suffer

31
00:01:34,018 --> 00:01:35,110
I just might
spare one

32
00:01:35,186 --> 00:01:36,676
And give a brother
a fair one

33
00:01:36,754 --> 00:01:37,948
Stay alert and on pees

34
00:01:38,022 --> 00:01:39,284
And I do work
with these

35
00:01:39,356 --> 00:01:40,789
Like Hercules

36
00:01:40,858 --> 00:01:42,792
Switch to southpaw,
split your right jaw

37
00:01:42,860 --> 00:01:43,952
'Cause I don't
like y'all

38
00:01:44,028 --> 00:01:45,461
I'm hype
when night fall smooth

39
00:01:45,529 --> 00:01:46,791
But I move
like an army

40
00:01:46,864 --> 00:01:47,853
Bulletproof down

41
00:01:47,932 --> 00:01:48,956
In case brothers
try to bomb me

42
00:01:49,033 --> 00:01:50,125
Puttin' brothers
to rest

43
00:01:50,201 --> 00:01:51,429
Like Eliot Ness

44
00:01:51,502 --> 00:01:53,129
'Cause I don't like stress

45
00:01:53,204 --> 00:01:55,729
Streets ain't a place
for innocent bystanders to stand

46
00:01:55,806 --> 00:01:57,137
Nothin's gonna
stop the plan

47
00:01:57,208 --> 00:01:58,436
I'll chill like Pacino

48
00:01:58,509 --> 00:02:00,477
Kill like De Niro,
black Gambino

49
00:02:00,544 --> 00:02:01,408
Die like a hero

50
00:02:01,479 --> 00:02:02,810
Livin' on shaky ground

51
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:04,074
Too close to the edge

52
00:02:04,148 --> 00:02:06,776
Let's see
if I know the ledge

53
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:11,747
Shells lay around
on the battle ground

54
00:02:11,822 --> 00:02:13,756
Dead bodies are found
throughout the town

55
00:02:13,824 --> 00:02:15,792
Try to put shame in my game
to make a name

56
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:16,952
I'm gonna
put it on a bullet

57
00:02:17,027 --> 00:02:18,858
Put it in your brain

58
00:02:18,929 --> 00:02:20,089
And my pockets
are still fat

59
00:02:20,164 --> 00:02:22,530
Wherever I'm at,
I get the welcome mat

60
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:23,999
So come say hi
to the bad guy

61
00:02:24,068 --> 00:02:25,262
Don't say goodbye

62
00:02:25,336 --> 00:02:26,928
I don't plan to die

63
00:02:27,004 --> 00:02:27,936
'Cause I get loose

64
00:02:28,005 --> 00:02:29,529
And I got troops

65
00:02:29,607 --> 00:02:30,699
And crazy juice

66
00:03:03,140 --> 00:03:05,074
Quincy, get up!
It's after 7:00,

67
00:03:05,142 --> 00:03:07,702
and you're going to be
late for school again!

68
00:03:11,315 --> 00:03:12,748
Quincy Powell,
did you hear me?

69
00:03:12,816 --> 00:03:14,579
I said get up.

70
00:03:14,652 --> 00:03:16,085
This is bullshit, man.

71
00:03:16,153 --> 00:03:18,087
Excuse me, young man,
what did you say?

72
00:03:18,155 --> 00:03:19,247
Nothin', Ma.

73
00:03:19,323 --> 00:03:22,087
That's what I thought.
Get up.

74
00:03:33,037 --> 00:03:35,597
<i> Enter the dragon 'cause
it's startin'to rain</i>

75
00:03:35,673 --> 00:03:37,573
<i> Rappers
on the bandwagon...</i>

76
00:03:45,182 --> 00:03:48,447
Gerard, Eric,
time to get up!

77
00:03:58,195 --> 00:04:00,527
Come on, man,
move it, man.

78
00:04:00,598 --> 00:04:01,895
Move your fat feet.

79
00:04:01,966 --> 00:04:04,628
You're too fat
to be smelling bad.

80
00:04:04,702 --> 00:04:08,069
You gonna never get
anywhere but... stop!

81
00:04:11,642 --> 00:04:13,303
Don't, you little bitch!

82
00:04:15,746 --> 00:04:17,737
Get your rusty butt up!

83
00:04:17,815 --> 00:04:19,578
I'm up, Pop,
I'm up.

84
00:04:19,650 --> 00:04:21,584
And do something
about this room.

85
00:04:21,652 --> 00:04:22,584
Sure thing.

86
00:04:28,826 --> 00:04:30,589
Fatness never
prospereth.

87
00:04:37,668 --> 00:04:38,760
Morning, Grandma.

88
00:04:38,836 --> 00:04:42,602
Oh, morning, baby.
Breakfast is ready.

89
00:04:43,941 --> 00:04:46,102
See if your father's hungry!

90
00:05:07,865 --> 00:05:11,562
Raheem, you know I got
a job interview this morning.

91
00:05:11,635 --> 00:05:14,399
Let me in.
I'm late as is.

92
00:05:14,471 --> 00:05:17,065
Raheem, let me
in the bathroom!

93
00:05:18,642 --> 00:05:19,574
How much?

94
00:05:19,643 --> 00:05:21,076
How much what?

95
00:05:21,145 --> 00:05:23,579
How much you willing
to give me to get in?

96
00:05:23,647 --> 00:05:26,081
Fuck you, Raheem!
I ain't givin' you shit!

97
00:05:26,150 --> 00:05:28,584
Raheem, let me in.
I'll give you a dollar.

98
00:05:28,652 --> 00:05:29,676
Ha ha!

99
00:05:32,656 --> 00:05:36,092
Quincy, I was talking
to Louise in 4-A.

100
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:38,094
Her boy Tyrone...

101
00:05:38,162 --> 00:05:40,096
You know Tyrone,
that tall skinny boy?

102
00:05:40,164 --> 00:05:41,256
Nice kid.

103
00:05:41,331 --> 00:05:44,095
He's looking to get
into the Acme School,

104
00:05:44,168 --> 00:05:46,102
that school
where they teach you

105
00:05:46,170 --> 00:05:48,434
to fix cars, washing machines,
and whatnot.

106
00:05:48,505 --> 00:05:50,097
You make good money
doing that.

107
00:05:50,174 --> 00:05:51,539
Are you listening to me?

108
00:05:51,608 --> 00:05:53,599
I'll give you $5.00,
Raheem.

109
00:05:53,677 --> 00:05:55,440
Now, let me in.

110
00:05:55,512 --> 00:05:56,706
Did you say $5.00?

111
00:05:56,780 --> 00:05:57,940
Yes, I did.

112
00:05:58,015 --> 00:05:59,607
Cool. $5.00.
I'm with that.

113
00:05:59,683 --> 00:06:01,548
Have you been
working out?

114
00:06:01,618 --> 00:06:04,553
You look nice.
You look real fine.

115
00:06:04,621 --> 00:06:06,714
I'll give it to you
later.

116
00:06:06,790 --> 00:06:08,724
Myra, you better
give me my $5.00!

117
00:06:08,792 --> 00:06:10,555
What's going on
out here?

118
00:06:10,627 --> 00:06:11,924
Nothin', Ma.

119
00:06:11,995 --> 00:06:13,826
<i> Better creation,
what a celebration</i>

120
00:06:13,897 --> 00:06:15,296
<i> My vocabulary
is varied</i>

121
00:06:15,365 --> 00:06:17,196
<i> Trouble like a trick hand,
sinking like quicksand</i>

122
00:06:17,267 --> 00:06:19,565
<i> Makin'the competition feel
like they need a kickstand</i>

123
00:06:19,636 --> 00:06:20,967
<i> To support
what they thought</i>

124
00:06:21,038 --> 00:06:23,506
<i> Would have brought them
some type of victory</i>

125
00:06:23,574 --> 00:06:25,235
<i> You better
never act, no</i>

126
00:06:25,309 --> 00:06:27,402
<i> Huh, 'nuff respect</i>

127
00:06:56,907 --> 00:07:02,038
<i>P- P-Puppy, oh, puppy, speak to me.</i>

128
00:07:02,112 --> 00:07:04,046
<i>G- G-Good ol'doggy.
Nice puppy.</i>

129
00:07:04,114 --> 00:07:07,049
<i>Oh, y-y-you poor thing.</i>

130
00:07:07,117 --> 00:07:09,210
Take it easy, Pop.

131
00:07:09,286 --> 00:07:10,878
Button up your coat.

132
00:07:10,954 --> 00:07:13,548
Don't be comin' back
all hours of the night.

133
00:07:13,624 --> 00:07:14,716
I won't.

134
00:07:14,792 --> 00:07:16,555
And clean up that room,

135
00:07:16,627 --> 00:07:19,061
or it's gonna be
me and you.

136
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:33,076
You can't play that music
the rest of your life.

137
00:07:33,143 --> 00:07:35,577
What time are you
comin' home?

138
00:07:37,147 --> 00:07:40,082
And you're not going
in the Army either.

139
00:07:40,150 --> 00:07:41,082
Remember that.

140
00:07:41,151 --> 00:07:43,415
Quincy, where's
your books?

141
00:07:43,487 --> 00:07:45,580
What's up, Lenny, man?
Better hurry that ass up.

142
00:07:45,656 --> 00:07:48,591
Mrs. Sanders ain't going
for that late shit no more.

143
00:07:48,659 --> 00:07:50,593
Yo, I need those notes
for biology class.

144
00:07:50,661 --> 00:07:53,095
If I flunk, I'll have to
kick your ass.

145
00:07:53,163 --> 00:07:54,255
I'm sorry.

146
00:07:54,331 --> 00:07:56,959
Damn, baby, what's up?
Can I get that number?

147
00:07:57,034 --> 00:07:59,025
Eric, come back here
and make up your bed!

148
00:07:59,102 --> 00:08:00,535
- Busted!
- Damn!

149
00:08:04,942 --> 00:08:05,874
Yo, Raheem!

150
00:08:09,246 --> 00:08:10,543
Yo, Raheem!

151
00:08:14,151 --> 00:08:17,609
Keesha. Keesha, wait.

152
00:08:17,688 --> 00:08:21,055
I don't want to argue.
I'm tired of that shit.

153
00:08:21,124 --> 00:08:23,456
What the fuck
do you want, then, Raheem?

154
00:08:23,527 --> 00:08:26,052
I got to take the baby
to the sitter.

155
00:08:26,129 --> 00:08:28,563
I could help.
That's my baby, too.

156
00:08:28,632 --> 00:08:30,065
If we got back
together...

157
00:08:30,133 --> 00:08:33,569
I ain't even about
to let you have my baby

158
00:08:33,637 --> 00:08:36,071
so you can have him
hangin' out with you

159
00:08:36,139 --> 00:08:38,073
and your fucked-up friends.

160
00:08:38,141 --> 00:08:39,938
And how would Charlene
feel about that?

161
00:08:40,010 --> 00:08:43,104
I ain't messin'
with Charlene no more.

162
00:08:43,180 --> 00:08:45,580
Raheem, you ain't even
foolin' nobody.

163
00:08:45,649 --> 00:08:48,117
Everybody knows.
It's all over the school.

164
00:08:48,185 --> 00:08:51,086
Come talk to me
when you're serious.

165
00:08:51,154 --> 00:08:52,587
I'm serious now.

166
00:08:52,656 --> 00:08:53,918
I'm serious, too,
Raheem!

167
00:08:53,991 --> 00:08:55,618
This does not
make you a man.

168
00:08:55,692 --> 00:08:57,592
I need a real man.

169
00:08:57,661 --> 00:09:01,028
I'm not lettin' my child
grow up and be fucked up

170
00:09:01,098 --> 00:09:04,033
like you and your
stupid-ass friends.

171
00:09:04,101 --> 00:09:05,966
Yeah, well,
fuck you, then!

172
00:09:06,036 --> 00:09:10,029
I don't need
your tired ass anyway, bitch!

173
00:09:10,107 --> 00:09:11,540
That was real smooth, man.

174
00:09:11,608 --> 00:09:12,870
I'm squashin' her.

175
00:09:12,943 --> 00:09:14,706
That shit is
too much work.

176
00:09:14,778 --> 00:09:16,712
I should've
let you have her.

177
00:09:16,780 --> 00:09:18,714
<i>I let you have her.</i>

178
00:09:18,782 --> 00:09:20,215
Just buggin', man.
What's up?

179
00:09:20,284 --> 00:09:21,581
Yeah. I thought so.

180
00:09:21,652 --> 00:09:24,052
So you wanna
be a gangster...

181
00:09:24,121 --> 00:09:25,713
Yo, Bishop!

182
00:09:27,624 --> 00:09:29,057
What you want?

183
00:09:30,794 --> 00:09:33,490
Your ass, punk!

184
00:09:33,563 --> 00:09:34,552
People been sayin'

185
00:09:34,631 --> 00:09:38,067
that you say
you can bust my ass.

186
00:09:38,135 --> 00:09:40,069
You believe that shit?

187
00:09:40,137 --> 00:09:41,104
So?

188
00:09:44,141 --> 00:09:46,575
Chill, chill,
chill, chill, chill.

189
00:09:46,643 --> 00:09:48,577
Smile, man, smile.

190
00:09:48,645 --> 00:09:50,044
See this?

191
00:09:50,113 --> 00:09:52,581
Take a real good look at him,

192
00:09:52,649 --> 00:09:56,085
'cause that's how
a dumb nigger commits suicide.

193
00:09:56,153 --> 00:09:59,589
You think your shit
is that bad, man?

194
00:09:59,656 --> 00:10:01,886
You got that much juice?

195
00:10:01,959 --> 00:10:03,256
God damn right.

196
00:10:03,327 --> 00:10:05,261
Don't nobody
fuck with me.

197
00:10:05,329 --> 00:10:07,593
'Cause you already
fucked up, man.

198
00:10:07,664 --> 00:10:10,258
You can't fuck up somethin'
that's already fucked up.

199
00:10:10,334 --> 00:10:13,098
If you wasn't
as fucked up as you are,

200
00:10:13,170 --> 00:10:15,229
you'd see
that shit, man!

201
00:10:15,305 --> 00:10:17,865
What a dumb nigger, man.

202
00:10:17,941 --> 00:10:20,569
Fuck you, you beans and rice
son of a bitch!

203
00:10:20,644 --> 00:10:22,942
Respect me.
I was almost your father,

204
00:10:23,013 --> 00:10:25,277
but the line
was too fucking long!

205
00:10:25,349 --> 00:10:27,613
Hey, hey,
it's cool, man.

206
00:10:27,684 --> 00:10:28,878
It's cool.

207
00:10:28,952 --> 00:10:31,785
Raheem, man, you better
tell your boy somethin',

208
00:10:31,855 --> 00:10:34,619
'cause I don't care
if he's crazy or not.

209
00:10:34,691 --> 00:10:36,784
I'll stomp the shit
out of his ass.

210
00:10:36,860 --> 00:10:38,794
You ain't saying
nothing but a word!

211
00:10:38,862 --> 00:10:41,626
He's just bullshittin'.
He didn't mean it.

212
00:10:41,698 --> 00:10:43,097
Shit if I didn't mean it.

213
00:10:43,166 --> 00:10:45,464
<i>Fuck that little
Puerto Rican maricon!</i>

214
00:10:45,535 --> 00:10:48,129
<i>Maricon? Maricon?
If you're looking' for faggots,</i>

215
00:10:48,205 --> 00:10:50,639
you ain't got to look no farther
than your pa.

216
00:10:50,707 --> 00:10:53,608
I hear he liked bein'
the prison yard whore!

217
00:10:53,677 --> 00:10:55,668
Fuck you,
motherfucker!

218
00:10:57,214 --> 00:10:59,910
Get away from my store!

219
00:10:59,983 --> 00:11:02,781
I'm gonna shoot
your pee-pee off, man.

220
00:11:08,025 --> 00:11:10,084
Tell me that wasn't
the shit.

221
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:11,320
You're crazy, man.

222
00:11:11,395 --> 00:11:14,762
Ain't had no fun like that
in a while.

223
00:11:14,831 --> 00:11:17,959
That nigger had you
by your neck and shit.

224
00:11:18,035 --> 00:11:19,434
I swear to God...

225
00:11:19,503 --> 00:11:21,596
What's up, Fat Chops?

226
00:11:21,671 --> 00:11:23,104
What's up, man?

227
00:11:23,173 --> 00:11:24,435
Hey, how you doin'?

228
00:11:24,508 --> 00:11:25,600
You're late, man.

229
00:11:25,675 --> 00:11:27,108
I feel good.

230
00:11:27,177 --> 00:11:29,042
Sorry, man.
I was busy, man.

231
00:11:29,112 --> 00:11:30,773
I had a hard time
gettin' away, man.

232
00:11:30,847 --> 00:11:32,610
Give those chubby palms
a rest,

233
00:11:32,682 --> 00:11:34,547
you'd get here
with the rest of us.

234
00:11:34,618 --> 00:11:37,610
Want to know
why I'm really late?

235
00:11:37,687 --> 00:11:39,621
I was doin'
the hootchy-kootchy

236
00:11:39,689 --> 00:11:41,816
with Donna Bromwell.

237
00:11:41,892 --> 00:11:44,019
So you boned
Donna Bromwell?

238
00:11:44,094 --> 00:11:45,959
Yeah, man.
She liked it, too.

239
00:11:46,029 --> 00:11:48,429
My man,
finally got that ass.

240
00:11:48,498 --> 00:11:49,795
I heard that.

241
00:11:49,866 --> 00:11:50,924
Thank you.
Appreciate it.

242
00:11:51,001 --> 00:11:52,161
So how was it?

243
00:11:52,235 --> 00:11:54,465
It was good.
What do you think?

244
00:11:54,538 --> 00:11:57,132
I heard Donna Bromwell
was a real freak.

245
00:11:57,207 --> 00:12:00,233
The bitch tried to fuck me
on the stove.

246
00:12:00,310 --> 00:12:02,801
She still got that,
uh, tattoo?

247
00:12:02,879 --> 00:12:05,575
No, man. I wasn't lookin'
for no tattoo.

248
00:12:05,649 --> 00:12:10,279
I was doin' the hootchy-kootchy,
my friend.

249
00:12:10,353 --> 00:12:13,811
You knew it was Donna
from that hair on her face.

250
00:12:13,890 --> 00:12:15,255
Yeah, man, come on.

251
00:12:15,325 --> 00:12:17,316
You didn't know about
Donna Bromwell, man?

252
00:12:17,394 --> 00:12:18,952
What, man, what?

253
00:12:19,029 --> 00:12:23,090
That she used to be
Donald Bromwell?

254
00:12:23,166 --> 00:12:24,292
Big Don?

255
00:12:24,367 --> 00:12:25,299
Don Juan.

256
00:12:25,368 --> 00:12:27,165
Fuck y'all, man.

257
00:12:27,237 --> 00:12:30,434
Come on, big, hefty,
tub-of-a-man you!

258
00:12:30,507 --> 00:12:31,838
Don't make me
come after you!

259
00:12:31,908 --> 00:12:35,105
Get the fuck off me!

260
00:12:35,178 --> 00:12:36,110
My man.

261
00:12:36,179 --> 00:12:39,637
You big
fat-head jalopy.

262
00:12:39,716 --> 00:12:40,876
'Reckin' crew!

263
00:12:42,686 --> 00:12:45,120
Hope you're feelin'
lucky today, my brother,

264
00:12:45,188 --> 00:12:47,622
'cause I'm getting ready
to bust your ass.

265
00:12:47,691 --> 00:12:50,125
You want me
to lie to you?

266
00:12:50,193 --> 00:12:52,627
Just 'cause you
pour syrup on shit

267
00:12:52,696 --> 00:12:54,254
don't make it pancakes.

268
00:12:54,331 --> 00:12:55,263
Q!

269
00:12:55,332 --> 00:12:56,264
What's up?

270
00:12:56,333 --> 00:12:57,459
What's happenin'?

271
00:12:57,534 --> 00:13:00,128
You got that
party tape for me?

272
00:13:00,203 --> 00:13:02,068
Yeah, I got the shit.

273
00:13:02,139 --> 00:13:04,232
My brother, my brother,
my brother, my brother.

274
00:13:04,307 --> 00:13:07,071
Bad news, though.
Bein' that we in a recession,

275
00:13:07,144 --> 00:13:09,578
the shit's gonna cost
$ 15 instead of 10.

276
00:13:09,646 --> 00:13:11,204
- $ 15.
- $ 15?

277
00:13:11,281 --> 00:13:12,578
Hit the button!
Hit the button!

278
00:13:12,649 --> 00:13:13,911
Pow!

279
00:13:13,984 --> 00:13:16,578
Kiss? Money?
What you gonna do, sweetheart?

280
00:13:16,653 --> 00:13:18,587
I ain't got all day.

281
00:13:18,655 --> 00:13:21,886
Do what you're told.
Give me a kiss.

282
00:13:21,958 --> 00:13:24,085
Was the last party
serious?

283
00:13:24,161 --> 00:13:25,594
It was slammin'?

284
00:13:25,662 --> 00:13:27,095
It was all right.

285
00:13:27,164 --> 00:13:28,426
It was dope, right?

286
00:13:28,498 --> 00:13:30,090
Do you hit
Brenda's skins?

287
00:13:30,167 --> 00:13:31,259
What?

288
00:13:31,334 --> 00:13:33,097
Did Brenda Witherspoon
shine your silver?

289
00:13:33,170 --> 00:13:35,070
My mother shines
our silver.

290
00:13:35,138 --> 00:13:37,106
All you could see
was that butt.

291
00:13:37,174 --> 00:13:39,608
I don't know why you thought
that was so tough.

292
00:13:39,676 --> 00:13:41,610
She got the snappy-nappy
dugout piece.

293
00:13:41,678 --> 00:13:43,475
Snappy-nappy
dugout piece?

294
00:13:44,748 --> 00:13:46,943
Did you fuck
Brenda Witherspoon?

295
00:13:48,518 --> 00:13:49,951
Yeah, I did, man.

296
00:13:50,020 --> 00:13:51,453
Yeah?
You did, right?

297
00:13:51,521 --> 00:13:53,546
$ 15, G.

298
00:13:53,623 --> 00:13:56,114
Lord, I came
at the perfect time.

299
00:13:56,193 --> 00:13:58,127
Pop two quarters in,
pop-tart,

300
00:13:58,195 --> 00:14:00,129
and let's get it on.

301
00:14:00,197 --> 00:14:02,062
Let me get
in that ass.

302
00:14:02,132 --> 00:14:05,067
What makes you think
you can beat me?

303
00:14:05,135 --> 00:14:06,227
Two reasons.

304
00:14:06,303 --> 00:14:09,568
1... if I lose,
I'm going to beat that ass.

305
00:14:09,639 --> 00:14:13,075
2... if I lose,
I'm going to beat that ass.

306
00:14:13,143 --> 00:14:15,611
Get this goddamn
game started,

307
00:14:15,679 --> 00:14:17,078
tugboat ass
motherfucker.

308
00:14:17,147 --> 00:14:18,580
What's up?
What's up?

309
00:14:18,648 --> 00:14:21,549
What you got?
Hey! Hey!

310
00:14:24,154 --> 00:14:25,621
Here they come!

311
00:14:25,689 --> 00:14:28,089
Put your asses
back in school!

312
00:14:28,158 --> 00:14:29,887
What's up? What's up?
Outta there.

313
00:14:32,095 --> 00:14:34,689
Steel, come
the fuck on!

314
00:14:34,764 --> 00:14:37,528
What the fuck?

315
00:14:37,601 --> 00:14:39,091
- See ya!
- Go!

316
00:14:43,306 --> 00:14:46,275
Bam! Kick!
You're out of there.

317
00:14:59,778 --> 00:15:00,642
Q!

318
00:15:41,953 --> 00:15:43,545
Stop!

319
00:15:43,622 --> 00:15:45,055
O.K., guys,
come on.

320
00:15:45,123 --> 00:15:46,556
That's it.
It's over.

321
00:15:46,625 --> 00:15:49,093
Let's go, guys.
Come on.

322
00:15:51,029 --> 00:15:53,554
Come on. Now.

323
00:15:53,632 --> 00:15:55,224
Let's go, guys.

324
00:15:59,905 --> 00:16:02,533
Yo!

325
00:16:02,607 --> 00:16:03,835
Whoa!

326
00:16:07,579 --> 00:16:08,511
Ain't nothin'.

327
00:16:08,580 --> 00:16:10,013
You all right?

328
00:16:10,082 --> 00:16:11,515
I know'd we could
beat 'em quick.

329
00:16:11,583 --> 00:16:13,016
Bust this!
Bust this!

330
00:16:13,085 --> 00:16:14,017
Bastards!

331
00:16:14,086 --> 00:16:17,021
You can't play
with this yo-yo.

332
00:16:17,089 --> 00:16:18,249
Stupid bitch!

333
00:16:18,323 --> 00:16:21,850
Fat-ass Steel
is stuck in school again

334
00:16:21,927 --> 00:16:23,019
Again?

335
00:16:26,598 --> 00:16:29,032
Yo, he ain't comin'.
Let's go.

336
00:16:29,101 --> 00:16:32,537
We ain't goin' nowhere
without Steel.

337
00:16:32,604 --> 00:16:34,196
Fuck, no.

338
00:16:35,607 --> 00:16:37,040
Here he comes.

339
00:16:37,109 --> 00:16:40,044
- Hurry up, man.
- Could ya?

340
00:16:40,112 --> 00:16:41,044
Fat bastard.

341
00:16:41,113 --> 00:16:42,546
Oh, shit!

342
00:16:42,614 --> 00:16:44,047
Come on, y'all!

343
00:16:44,116 --> 00:16:45,549
What's up?
What's up?

344
00:16:49,621 --> 00:16:51,612
<i> Yeah, refuse
to get took down</i>

345
00:16:51,690 --> 00:16:52,816
<i> A goddamn killer</i>

346
00:16:52,891 --> 00:16:54,222
<i> Comin'straight
from the Oaktown</i>

347
00:16:54,292 --> 00:16:56,556
<i> Step out of line,
it's mandatory I hurt ya</i>

348
00:16:56,628 --> 00:16:57,890
<i> My hobbies
in life...</i>

349
00:16:57,963 --> 00:16:59,055
Boo!

350
00:17:06,204 --> 00:17:08,001
Yo, what time is it?

351
00:17:08,073 --> 00:17:09,199
Almost 12:00.

352
00:17:09,274 --> 00:17:13,005
How much money we make
at the arcade today?

353
00:17:13,078 --> 00:17:14,511
I can count!

354
00:17:14,579 --> 00:17:15,841
25.

355
00:17:15,914 --> 00:17:19,008
Not bad. Let's go
chill out somewhere.

356
00:17:20,752 --> 00:17:24,051
Yo! Hey, you see
this shit?

357
00:17:24,122 --> 00:17:26,022
I was tellin' you
all about this.

358
00:17:26,091 --> 00:17:28,082
This shit is mine,
word up.

359
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:30,526
We gotta worry about
runnin' into Radames,

360
00:17:30,595 --> 00:17:32,119
and this nigger
talkin' about

361
00:17:32,197 --> 00:17:34,028
some bullshit-ass
deejay contest.

362
00:17:34,099 --> 00:17:37,227
First prize is
custom gold 1200s

363
00:17:37,302 --> 00:17:39,270
and a six-month contract
to deejay at the Ruffhouse.

364
00:17:39,337 --> 00:17:43,296
Better than this pool hall
nickel-and-dime bullshit.

365
00:17:43,375 --> 00:17:45,536
Yo, DJ Plaz,
DJ Rich E. Rich,

366
00:17:45,610 --> 00:17:47,737
Pete Rock, and DJ Scratch
gonna be there.

367
00:17:47,813 --> 00:17:49,872
So what?

368
00:17:49,948 --> 00:17:51,848
They won both contests
last year.

369
00:17:51,917 --> 00:17:53,544
That was the Hott Boxx.

370
00:17:53,618 --> 00:17:55,552
Anybody could have won
in that shit.

371
00:17:55,620 --> 00:17:57,554
This is the Ruffhouse.
The comp will be serious.

372
00:17:57,622 --> 00:18:01,319
There ain't
no greater comp than me.

373
00:18:01,393 --> 00:18:03,987
Y'all ain't got
no confidence in me now?

374
00:18:04,062 --> 00:18:05,529
Y'all supposed to be
my boys.

375
00:18:05,597 --> 00:18:08,327
They been all over.
Everybody know them.

376
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:09,697
You just local.

377
00:18:09,768 --> 00:18:12,293
Local?

378
00:18:12,370 --> 00:18:15,464
Y'all kiss my local ass,
you know what I'm sayin'?

379
00:18:15,540 --> 00:18:17,508
All right.
Come on, Q.

380
00:18:17,576 --> 00:18:20,010
You're still
my favorite local deejay.

381
00:18:20,078 --> 00:18:22,512
I'm going to pick up
some party tapes

382
00:18:22,581 --> 00:18:23,878
for my audition tape.

383
00:18:23,949 --> 00:18:26,349
That's all right
with you, Raheem?

384
00:18:26,418 --> 00:18:27,476
Yeah, man.

385
00:18:27,552 --> 00:18:30,521
<i> Is he good to you?</i>

386
00:18:30,589 --> 00:18:32,523
<i> Yeah</i>

387
00:18:32,591 --> 00:18:34,525
<i> Is he good to you?</i>

388
00:18:34,593 --> 00:18:39,860
<i> Whoa, whoa,
whoa, yeah</i>

389
00:18:39,931 --> 00:18:41,364
<i> Oh</i>

390
00:18:41,433 --> 00:18:43,526
<i> Is he good to you?</i>

391
00:18:45,270 --> 00:18:49,036
<i> When my love
comes down</i>

392
00:18:49,107 --> 00:18:53,441
<i> I don't have
to run around</i>

393
00:18:53,511 --> 00:18:54,569
<i> I've got you</i>

394
00:18:54,646 --> 00:18:57,945
<i> And you know
just what to do</i>

395
00:18:58,016 --> 00:19:00,450
<i> To fulfill
all my needs</i>

396
00:19:00,518 --> 00:19:02,145
<i> And satisfy me</i>

397
00:19:02,220 --> 00:19:04,814
<i> But I'd like to know</i>

398
00:19:04,890 --> 00:19:09,327
<i> The sexual healing
is mutual...</i>

399
00:19:09,394 --> 00:19:13,495
Excuse me.

400
00:19:13,565 --> 00:19:15,829
Hi. Can I help you?

401
00:19:19,070 --> 00:19:21,004
Uh... yeah.

402
00:19:21,072 --> 00:19:24,508
Let me get your...
EPMD's new album

403
00:19:24,576 --> 00:19:26,874
and your name
and your phone number.

404
00:19:26,945 --> 00:19:29,846
Oh, O.K.
I can get you the tape.

405
00:19:29,915 --> 00:19:32,850
You want my name
and my number?

406
00:19:32,918 --> 00:19:35,785
O.K., here's my name.

407
00:19:35,854 --> 00:19:38,015
It's Juaniqua...

408
00:19:38,089 --> 00:19:39,522
Ross.

409
00:19:39,591 --> 00:19:42,526
And here's my number.

410
00:19:44,095 --> 00:19:47,030
Why don't you put
your address on there?

411
00:19:47,098 --> 00:19:48,793
Oh, O.K.

412
00:19:48,867 --> 00:19:51,267
Does this mean
we're going out?

413
00:19:51,336 --> 00:19:52,598
Yeah.

414
00:19:52,671 --> 00:19:54,036
You got
three friends?

415
00:19:54,105 --> 00:19:55,037
Yeah.

416
00:19:55,106 --> 00:19:56,539
Who look just like you?

417
00:19:56,608 --> 00:19:58,735
I don't know.
I'm kind of one of a kind.

418
00:19:58,810 --> 00:20:00,038
What's your name?

419
00:20:00,111 --> 00:20:02,545
My name is, um, Ed.
Eddie.

420
00:20:02,614 --> 00:20:04,548
Ed? Eddie, O.K.

421
00:20:04,616 --> 00:20:05,913
So you going to
call me?

422
00:20:05,984 --> 00:20:08,384
Put that shit back.

423
00:20:08,453 --> 00:20:10,546
Anytime.
Anytime you want.

424
00:20:10,622 --> 00:20:12,249
Uh-huh.

425
00:20:12,324 --> 00:20:14,451
You know, you are sexy.

426
00:20:14,526 --> 00:20:16,551
Thank you. O.K.

427
00:20:16,628 --> 00:20:18,562
That's a gold tooth?
I like it.

428
00:20:18,630 --> 00:20:20,564
I'm going to get
another one.

429
00:20:20,632 --> 00:20:22,896
I want to cover up
the whole front.

430
00:20:22,968 --> 00:20:25,232
When are we going out,
Saturday?

431
00:20:25,303 --> 00:20:26,736
I don't know.

432
00:20:26,805 --> 00:20:29,137
Sir? Sir!

433
00:20:29,207 --> 00:20:30,572
Sir, can I check
that newspaper?

434
00:20:30,642 --> 00:20:31,700
Can I call tonight?

435
00:20:31,776 --> 00:20:33,073
Wait a second.

436
00:20:33,144 --> 00:20:35,078
Sir, where are you going?

437
00:20:35,146 --> 00:20:37,080
Give back my tape!

438
00:20:37,148 --> 00:20:38,979
I'm not paying
for this tape.

439
00:20:39,050 --> 00:20:41,848
It's not Christmas.
Get a job, why don't you?

440
00:20:43,021 --> 00:20:45,581
Play the sax

441
00:20:45,657 --> 00:20:49,593
Everybody love him
to the max

442
00:20:49,661 --> 00:20:52,596
Man, I'm hungry.
Let's get something to eat.

443
00:20:52,664 --> 00:20:54,598
Let's go
to Steel's house.

444
00:20:54,666 --> 00:20:56,099
His mom ain't home.

445
00:20:56,167 --> 00:20:57,099
Taxi! Taxi!

446
00:20:57,168 --> 00:20:59,602
What she got
in the refrigerator?

447
00:20:59,671 --> 00:21:01,536
She still got
them turkey wings?

448
00:21:01,606 --> 00:21:03,540
No, man.
She ain't been shoppin'.

449
00:21:03,608 --> 00:21:06,042
I believe we need
to go to your crib

450
00:21:06,111 --> 00:21:08,545
and see what's
in the fridge.

451
00:21:08,613 --> 00:21:09,705
Hi.

452
00:21:09,781 --> 00:21:13,046
Yo, Q. Go in and get me
some cigarettes.

453
00:21:13,118 --> 00:21:15,052
Why I got to
go get them?

454
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:16,553
It's your turn,
motherfucker!

455
00:21:16,621 --> 00:21:19,055
I got it.
I got it.

456
00:21:19,124 --> 00:21:21,058
Oh, man.
That's cold.

457
00:21:21,126 --> 00:21:23,185
Lucky son of a bitch.

458
00:21:23,261 --> 00:21:25,559
<i> Listen, party people, y'all</i>

459
00:21:25,630 --> 00:21:27,564
<i> I'm going to tell you
what it's all about</i>

460
00:21:27,632 --> 00:21:29,566
<i> We got ourselves
together now</i>

461
00:21:29,634 --> 00:21:31,625
<i> I'm gonna keep it
real, real steady</i>

462
00:21:31,703 --> 00:21:34,035
<i> Come along
and join us now</i>

463
00:21:34,105 --> 00:21:36,073
<i> People, get ready</i>

464
00:21:36,141 --> 00:21:38,041
<i> We're gonna
get ya</i>

465
00:21:44,482 --> 00:21:46,416
<i> We're gonna get ya</i>

466
00:21:54,092 --> 00:21:55,525
Oh, shit.

467
00:21:55,593 --> 00:21:57,527
Blizz, man,
what's up, man?

468
00:21:57,595 --> 00:21:59,028
What's going on?
It's Q.

469
00:21:59,097 --> 00:22:00,086
What's up, Q. Man?

470
00:22:00,165 --> 00:22:03,032
How you doing?
It's good to see you, man.

471
00:22:03,101 --> 00:22:05,035
I'm all right.
How's your crew?

472
00:22:05,103 --> 00:22:07,037
They outside waiting.
When you got paroled?

473
00:22:07,105 --> 00:22:09,539
I got paroled
the other day, man.

474
00:22:09,607 --> 00:22:12,041
I hope you're
taking care of yourself.

475
00:22:12,110 --> 00:22:14,544
Of course I'm
taking care of myself.

476
00:22:14,612 --> 00:22:16,546
It's nice to see, man.

477
00:22:16,614 --> 00:22:18,912
Pardon me.
I'm about to rob this place.

478
00:22:18,983 --> 00:22:21,349
Everybody,
put your hands in the air

479
00:22:21,419 --> 00:22:24,047
and face the fuckin' bar!

480
00:22:24,122 --> 00:22:25,851
Oh, shit, man.

481
00:22:25,924 --> 00:22:27,448
Don't look at me!

482
00:22:27,525 --> 00:22:29,186
Yo, Q. You want
a piece of this?

483
00:22:29,260 --> 00:22:31,660
No, man.
I'm all right.

484
00:22:31,729 --> 00:22:33,492
All right, everybody,

485
00:22:33,565 --> 00:22:34,497
strip!

486
00:22:34,566 --> 00:22:37,000
Take your fuckin'
clothes off!

487
00:22:37,068 --> 00:22:39,002
Hurry up, god damn it,

488
00:22:39,070 --> 00:22:40,935
'cause you look good!

489
00:22:41,005 --> 00:22:42,939
As fat as you are,

490
00:22:43,007 --> 00:22:44,941
there ain't no food
in the house?

491
00:22:45,009 --> 00:22:46,943
Yeah, she's going
shopping tonight.

492
00:22:47,011 --> 00:22:48,444
No, we're going today.

493
00:22:48,513 --> 00:22:49,946
Ah, thank you.

494
00:22:50,014 --> 00:22:52,949
Yo, Blizzard is in there
right now

495
00:22:53,017 --> 00:22:54,450
stickin' the place up.

496
00:22:54,519 --> 00:22:55,451
Word, right now?

497
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:56,953
He let you out?

498
00:22:57,021 --> 00:23:00,457
He asked me if I wanted
a piece of the action.

499
00:23:00,525 --> 00:23:01,890
You said no?

500
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:03,393
What are you, crazy?

501
00:23:03,461 --> 00:23:04,393
I don't think so.

502
00:23:04,462 --> 00:23:06,396
Let me tell you
something.

503
00:23:06,464 --> 00:23:08,398
That crazy motherfucker
is goin' down.

504
00:23:08,466 --> 00:23:10,400
I'm making for
god damn sure

505
00:23:10,468 --> 00:23:11,526
that we're
not goin' with him.

506
00:23:11,603 --> 00:23:13,537
You know how much
money is in there?

507
00:23:13,605 --> 00:23:15,038
We are in there, man.

508
00:23:15,106 --> 00:23:16,539
I said no, man.

509
00:23:16,608 --> 00:23:19,543
That shit is out.
Now, come on.

510
00:23:22,947 --> 00:23:24,380
Come on, man.

511
00:23:24,449 --> 00:23:25,916
Come on, man.

512
00:23:47,238 --> 00:23:50,571
I thought that
was your woman.

513
00:23:50,642 --> 00:23:52,576
Man, what you gonna do?

514
00:24:03,755 --> 00:24:05,655
Steel's kitchen.

515
00:24:08,593 --> 00:24:10,083
Almost empty.

516
00:24:17,602 --> 00:24:19,536
Mmm!

517
00:24:19,604 --> 00:24:21,902
Got to get it right,
buddy.

518
00:24:21,973 --> 00:24:25,534
Oh, it's up now.
Oh, shit.

519
00:24:25,610 --> 00:24:30,380
<i>Aah!</i>

520
00:24:30,448 --> 00:24:32,382
All right,
there he goes.

521
00:24:32,450 --> 00:24:34,475
Bust 'em!
Bust 'em!

522
00:24:34,552 --> 00:24:36,144
Boo-yeah!

523
00:24:36,221 --> 00:24:37,153
Boo-yeah!

524
00:24:37,222 --> 00:24:38,154
Pow! Boo-yeah!

525
00:24:38,223 --> 00:24:39,713
Aw, shit!

526
00:24:47,098 --> 00:24:50,465
Damn, Steel.
What the fuck is this mess, man?

527
00:24:50,535 --> 00:24:52,059
Bacon and eggs
and hot sauce, man.

528
00:24:52,136 --> 00:24:54,263
I mix it like this
all the time.

529
00:24:54,339 --> 00:24:58,105
I'm too hungry
to throw this shit away.

530
00:24:58,176 --> 00:24:59,768
<i>But I only did it
for you, Ed.</i>

531
00:25:00,878 --> 00:25:03,005
<i>Cody still ain't
gonna like to hear</i>

532
00:25:03,081 --> 00:25:05,140
<i>that she got it
in the back.</i>

533
00:25:05,216 --> 00:25:08,276
Oh, shit!
Shot his moms in the back.

534
00:25:08,353 --> 00:25:10,787
Yo, Steel. Let me borrow
these two till tomorrow.

535
00:25:10,855 --> 00:25:12,288
This shit's dope.

536
00:25:12,357 --> 00:25:14,791
Excuse me, partner,
can you keep that shit down?

537
00:25:14,859 --> 00:25:17,157
You see me watching TV.

538
00:25:17,228 --> 00:25:18,160
<i>Heh heh heh!</i>

539
00:25:29,607 --> 00:25:30,539
<i>Made it, Ma!</i>

540
00:25:30,608 --> 00:25:32,041
Made it, Ma!

541
00:25:32,110 --> 00:25:33,042
Top of the world!

542
00:25:33,111 --> 00:25:34,544
Top of the world!

543
00:25:34,612 --> 00:25:36,045
Yo!

544
00:25:39,117 --> 00:25:42,052
If you gotta go out,
that's how you go out.

545
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:45,783
That motherfucker took
his destiny in his own hands.

546
00:25:45,857 --> 00:25:46,949
Mmm, some destiny.

547
00:25:47,025 --> 00:25:48,549
What you know about it,
Big Chops?

548
00:25:48,626 --> 00:25:49,888
What you ever control?

549
00:25:49,961 --> 00:25:52,395
I control my life.

550
00:25:52,463 --> 00:25:53,555
That's bullshit.

551
00:25:53,631 --> 00:25:56,156
I got more control
over your life than you do.

552
00:25:56,234 --> 00:25:57,861
How you figure that?

553
00:25:57,935 --> 00:25:59,664
I'm lettin' you breathe,
ain't I?

554
00:25:59,737 --> 00:26:02,604
You can't even
walk your own block

555
00:26:02,674 --> 00:26:05,507
without getting fucked up
by Radames, let's not forget.

556
00:26:05,576 --> 00:26:06,975
Ha ha ha.

557
00:26:07,045 --> 00:26:09,513
Oh, shit!
It's Blizzard!

558
00:26:09,580 --> 00:26:12,378
<i>A gunman was killed
in a shoot-out with police</i>

559
00:26:12,450 --> 00:26:14,884
<i>as he attempted to rob
the Harlemwood bar</i>

560
00:26:14,952 --> 00:26:16,852
<i>just under an hour ago.</i>

561
00:26:16,921 --> 00:26:18,047
<i>The gunman,</i>

562
00:26:18,122 --> 00:26:19,384
<i>identified as 20-year-old
Barnett Jerkins,</i>

563
00:26:19,457 --> 00:26:22,187
<i>wounded two officers before
he himself was killed.</i>

564
00:26:22,260 --> 00:26:25,525
<i>On the news at 7:00,
we'll have more on this story</i>

565
00:26:25,596 --> 00:26:27,530
<i>as well as an update
on the campaign...</i>

566
00:26:27,598 --> 00:26:29,532
<i>Yo, man, we were
just down there.</i>

567
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:31,534
<i>To have the already
financially strapped city</i>

568
00:26:31,602 --> 00:26:32,899
<i>provide more
police protection</i>

569
00:26:32,970 --> 00:26:35,461
<i>on the subway els
after dark.</i>

570
00:26:42,613 --> 00:26:45,548
What the fuck are you doing, man?
Come here!

571
00:26:45,616 --> 00:26:47,641
Fuckin' Radames.

572
00:26:50,121 --> 00:26:52,419
We ain't shit.

573
00:26:52,490 --> 00:26:54,720
Man, what's your problem?

574
00:26:54,792 --> 00:26:56,225
You're my fuckin' problem!

575
00:26:56,294 --> 00:26:58,228
People sweat us
on the street,

576
00:26:58,296 --> 00:27:00,059
and you don't even
give a fuck.

577
00:27:00,131 --> 00:27:01,894
I think you're
exaggerating.

578
00:27:01,966 --> 00:27:03,399
That's bullshit, man!

579
00:27:03,468 --> 00:27:06,494
We run from the cops,
we run from Radames,

580
00:27:06,571 --> 00:27:08,004
we run from
security guards,

581
00:27:08,072 --> 00:27:11,007
we run from Old Man Quiles
and his bullshit store

582
00:27:11,075 --> 00:27:13,509
when he come
with that bullshit gun.

583
00:27:13,578 --> 00:27:16,012
All we do
is fuckin' run!

584
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:18,947
I feel like I'm on
the god damn track team.

585
00:27:19,016 --> 00:27:20,506
I'm serious!

586
00:27:20,585 --> 00:27:22,212
What's the matter,
Raheem?

587
00:27:22,286 --> 00:27:23,719
Nothin' to say?

588
00:27:26,090 --> 00:27:27,853
That's 'cause
you know I'm right.

589
00:27:27,925 --> 00:27:29,654
In your heart,
you know I'm right.

590
00:27:29,727 --> 00:27:32,753
Yo, big man! If you want
respect, you gotta earn it.

591
00:27:32,830 --> 00:27:34,263
You damn right!

592
00:27:34,332 --> 00:27:36,266
You gotta be ready
to go down,

593
00:27:36,334 --> 00:27:38,029
stand up,
and die like Blizzard did

594
00:27:38,102 --> 00:27:39,467
if you want some juice.

595
00:27:39,537 --> 00:27:41,528
Blizzard? Blizzard ain't
stickin' up to nothin' now.

596
00:27:41,606 --> 00:27:43,540
That's 'cause we wasn't there
to back him up!

597
00:27:43,608 --> 00:27:45,132
If we was there...

598
00:27:45,209 --> 00:27:47,973
There'd be five dead niggers
instead of one!

599
00:27:49,714 --> 00:27:52,148
You ain't sayin' nothin' now,
right, big man?

600
00:27:52,216 --> 00:27:54,150
I never thought
I'd see the day

601
00:27:54,218 --> 00:27:55,776
when you'd
talk like a punk.

602
00:27:55,853 --> 00:27:56,842
Fuck you, man!

603
00:27:56,921 --> 00:27:57,853
Yo, chill!

604
00:27:57,922 --> 00:27:59,549
Fuck chill!
Check yourself, Q.

605
00:27:59,624 --> 00:28:00,989
You gotta
snatch some collars

606
00:28:01,058 --> 00:28:02,992
and let them
motherfuckers know

607
00:28:03,060 --> 00:28:04,994
you're there
to take them out

608
00:28:05,062 --> 00:28:06,859
anytime you
feel like it.

609
00:28:06,931 --> 00:28:08,865
You gotta get the ground
beneath your feet,

610
00:28:08,933 --> 00:28:10,491
get the wind
behind your back,

611
00:28:10,568 --> 00:28:12,001
and go out in a blaze.

612
00:28:12,069 --> 00:28:13,502
Otherwise
you ain't shit.

613
00:28:13,571 --> 00:28:16,699
You might as well be dead
your damn yourself.

614
00:28:16,774 --> 00:28:18,708
You tryin' to tell me
I ain't shit?

615
00:28:18,776 --> 00:28:21,210
I ain't tryin'
to tell you shit.

616
00:28:21,279 --> 00:28:24,214
I'll tell your mama
you ain't shit.

617
00:28:25,783 --> 00:28:28,718
Yo, man, what
are we fightin' for?

618
00:28:28,786 --> 00:28:31,516
I don't know, nigger.
You ready to die?

619
00:28:31,589 --> 00:28:33,022
You're fucked up, man.

620
00:28:33,090 --> 00:28:36,184
Don't turn your fuckin'
back on me, nigger!

621
00:28:36,260 --> 00:28:39,286
You broke
the fuckin' vase, man!

622
00:28:39,363 --> 00:28:41,160
What the fuck
is y'all doin', man?

623
00:28:41,232 --> 00:28:43,166
Damn, man!
What the fuck?

624
00:28:43,234 --> 00:28:46,067
Messin' up my shit, man!

625
00:28:46,137 --> 00:28:47,069
Feed y'all!

626
00:28:47,138 --> 00:28:48,400
Sorry, man. Here!

627
00:28:48,473 --> 00:28:49,906
Fuck that money, man!

628
00:28:49,974 --> 00:28:51,407
Look at that shit!

629
00:28:51,476 --> 00:28:53,410
I got to tell
my parents...

630
00:28:53,478 --> 00:28:54,911
Shut the fuck up!

631
00:28:54,979 --> 00:28:56,412
All right, that's it!

632
00:28:56,481 --> 00:28:57,413
That's it!

633
00:28:57,482 --> 00:29:00,315
Bishop, I want you and Q

634
00:29:00,384 --> 00:29:02,750
to settle this shit
right now!

635
00:29:02,820 --> 00:29:04,981
Come on, y'all.

636
00:29:05,056 --> 00:29:05,988
You're like brothers.

637
00:29:06,057 --> 00:29:07,854
<i>Fuck that.
You are brothers!</i>

638
00:29:07,925 --> 00:29:10,485
<i>Fuck that.
We used to be like brothers.</i>

639
00:29:10,561 --> 00:29:13,496
All right,
we're going to squash it.

640
00:29:13,564 --> 00:29:14,997
What do you say?

641
00:29:15,066 --> 00:29:16,192
Bishop?

642
00:29:18,569 --> 00:29:20,503
Yeah, it's cool.

643
00:29:41,561 --> 00:29:42,823
All right.

644
00:29:55,008 --> 00:29:56,441
I'm not makin' sense!
You're not makin' sense!

645
00:29:58,512 --> 00:29:59,945
You know why?

646
00:30:01,114 --> 00:30:03,207
What?

647
00:30:03,283 --> 00:30:05,717
Uh, how you doin'?
Is Yolanda there?

648
00:30:05,786 --> 00:30:07,515
Who the hell are you?

649
00:30:07,587 --> 00:30:09,521
Hi, Q.
Let him in, Frank.

650
00:30:15,929 --> 00:30:17,362
Have a seat.

651
00:30:17,431 --> 00:30:19,365
I'm just cleaning out
some of Frank's things.

652
00:30:19,433 --> 00:30:22,197
Um, Frank, Q.
Q. Frank.

653
00:30:30,444 --> 00:30:32,036
How you doin'?

654
00:30:42,622 --> 00:30:44,112
Q.

655
00:30:44,191 --> 00:30:47,126
What, did names like
Mustafah and Akbar

656
00:30:47,194 --> 00:30:49,094
become too hard
to spell?

657
00:30:49,162 --> 00:30:51,562
My real name is Quincy,

658
00:30:51,631 --> 00:30:54,065
and I'm not too fond
of that name,

659
00:30:54,134 --> 00:30:57,069
so people call me Q
or GQ. You know,

660
00:30:57,137 --> 00:30:58,468
like a nickname,
abbreviation.

661
00:30:58,538 --> 00:30:59,971
Well, uh, Quincy,

662
00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:03,737
shouldn't you be out stealing
hubcaps or something like that?

663
00:31:03,810 --> 00:31:05,334
Asshole.

664
00:31:05,412 --> 00:31:08,438
Excuse me? Speak up.
I can't hear you, boy.

665
00:31:08,515 --> 00:31:10,449
O.K., Frank, I found it.

666
00:31:10,517 --> 00:31:12,678
Remember these?

667
00:31:12,752 --> 00:31:14,185
Ha ha ha.

668
00:31:14,254 --> 00:31:17,189
What the hell are you laughing at,
you chain snatcher?

669
00:31:17,257 --> 00:31:19,191
Look, who is this kid,

670
00:31:19,259 --> 00:31:21,193
and what is he
doing here?

671
00:31:21,261 --> 00:31:23,195
Frank, don't you think
it's a little late

672
00:31:23,263 --> 00:31:25,197
to try acting
like a husband now?

673
00:31:25,265 --> 00:31:27,699
You're taking this
save-the-children shit too far.

674
00:31:27,767 --> 00:31:28,699
Bye.

675
00:31:28,768 --> 00:31:30,531
Just telling you
for your own good.

676
00:31:30,604 --> 00:31:31,593
Bye, Frank.

677
00:31:31,671 --> 00:31:33,605
I can't express
concern, what?

678
00:31:38,612 --> 00:31:40,102
So that's him, huh?

679
00:31:41,281 --> 00:31:43,476
That's him.

680
00:31:43,550 --> 00:31:45,541
You know, he got a real
attitude problem.

681
00:31:45,619 --> 00:31:46,881
Definitely.

682
00:31:54,628 --> 00:31:56,562
Mmm, baby.

683
00:32:04,571 --> 00:32:06,004
You're sweatin' already.

684
00:32:06,072 --> 00:32:08,006
I been working out.

685
00:32:08,074 --> 00:32:11,339
You don't mind
a little sweat, do you?

686
00:32:11,411 --> 00:32:14,505
<i>I'm deejay Ralph McDaniels here.</i>

687
00:32:14,581 --> 00:32:18,017
<i> Hey hey</i>

688
00:32:18,084 --> 00:32:20,678
<i> Yeah yeah</i>

689
00:32:23,924 --> 00:32:27,018
<i> Eh ooh eh ooh</i>

690
00:32:27,093 --> 00:32:30,028
<i> Yeah</i>

691
00:32:30,096 --> 00:32:34,533
<i> Now I lay me
down to sleep</i>

692
00:32:34,601 --> 00:32:37,536
<i> I pray my Lord
my soul to keep</i>

693
00:32:37,604 --> 00:32:39,538
Mmm.

694
00:32:39,606 --> 00:32:41,039
Want some?

695
00:32:41,107 --> 00:32:42,540
Mm-mmm.

696
00:32:42,609 --> 00:32:44,042
What time is it?

697
00:32:44,110 --> 00:32:47,045
<i> I pray my Lord
my soul to take</i>

698
00:32:47,113 --> 00:32:49,047
Past 10:00.

699
00:32:49,115 --> 00:32:52,050
I got to get
ready for work.

700
00:32:52,118 --> 00:32:55,053
<i> And you'll be sayin'
daddy to me</i>

701
00:32:55,121 --> 00:32:56,213
Mmm.

702
00:32:56,289 --> 00:32:59,053
Hmm. Why you playin'
with my spot?

703
00:32:59,125 --> 00:33:01,491
You say you got to
get ready for work.

704
00:33:01,561 --> 00:33:02,994
Is that your spot?

705
00:33:03,063 --> 00:33:05,998
Yeah. You know
it's my spot.

706
00:33:06,066 --> 00:33:08,159
<i> Don't worry, baby</i>

707
00:33:09,569 --> 00:33:11,503
Wish I could
spend the night,

708
00:33:11,571 --> 00:33:13,004
know what I'm sayin'?

709
00:33:13,073 --> 00:33:14,506
That would be nice.

710
00:33:14,574 --> 00:33:16,542
Sleep all day.

711
00:33:20,580 --> 00:33:23,515
I could make you
breakfast in bed.

712
00:33:23,583 --> 00:33:26,518
That'd be dope. That'd
be the most word, huh?

713
00:33:26,586 --> 00:33:31,523
I... I think you'd better let me
deal with breakfast.

714
00:33:31,591 --> 00:33:33,024
I can cook.

715
00:33:33,093 --> 00:33:35,857
Mm-hmm.
You can cook, all right.

716
00:33:35,929 --> 00:33:37,021
Ha.

717
00:33:53,113 --> 00:33:54,045
What's up?

718
00:33:54,114 --> 00:33:55,376
Yo, what's up,
money?

719
00:33:55,448 --> 00:33:57,211
What are you
doin' here, man?

720
00:33:57,284 --> 00:33:58,979
We got a meeting
at the ball court.

721
00:33:59,052 --> 00:33:59,984
When is it?

722
00:34:00,053 --> 00:34:00,917
Tomorrow mornin'.

723
00:34:00,987 --> 00:34:03,182
I can't make it, man.

724
00:34:03,256 --> 00:34:05,690
What do you mean,
you can't make it?

725
00:34:05,759 --> 00:34:07,488
I got a real important
appointment.

726
00:34:07,560 --> 00:34:08,993
Well, how important is it?

727
00:34:09,062 --> 00:34:10,859
It's my deejay audition.

728
00:34:10,930 --> 00:34:12,158
Oh, man.

729
00:34:14,067 --> 00:34:14,999
All right, Q.

730
00:34:15,068 --> 00:34:17,002
I'm going to
straighten this out

731
00:34:17,070 --> 00:34:19,004
with the rest
of the boys,

732
00:34:19,072 --> 00:34:21,131
but make sure you
get there after you're done.

733
00:34:21,207 --> 00:34:22,640
This is
serious business,

734
00:34:22,709 --> 00:34:25,143
so we're gonna
wait for you.

735
00:34:25,211 --> 00:34:26,143
That's cool.

736
00:34:26,212 --> 00:34:28,146
Why don't you tell me
what it is now,

737
00:34:28,214 --> 00:34:29,647
get it over with?

738
00:34:29,716 --> 00:34:31,377
Later.

739
00:34:31,451 --> 00:34:33,510
By the way,

740
00:34:33,586 --> 00:34:35,213
good luck, man.

741
00:34:37,590 --> 00:34:39,558
Smooth.

742
00:36:51,591 --> 00:36:55,527
What do you mean,
it ain't good enough?

743
00:36:55,595 --> 00:36:56,527
My name is Flex.

744
00:36:56,596 --> 00:36:58,530
Look, this brother
look like Gumby.

745
00:36:58,598 --> 00:37:00,429
What you talkin' about,
I ain't good enough?

746
00:37:00,500 --> 00:37:01,967
I mean exactly
what I said.

747
00:37:02,035 --> 00:37:03,468
You need
more experience.

748
00:37:03,536 --> 00:37:05,470
You need to work
on your mixing more.

749
00:37:05,538 --> 00:37:07,472
My... my...
what you mean?

750
00:37:07,540 --> 00:37:09,474
What the fuck's
wrong with my mix?

751
00:37:09,542 --> 00:37:11,476
I know you didn't
snatch that from me.

752
00:37:11,544 --> 00:37:12,977
What's wrong
with my mix?

753
00:37:13,046 --> 00:37:14,980
Look, the shit
is totally sloppy.

754
00:37:15,048 --> 00:37:16,982
Only a fool would
open up like you.

755
00:37:17,050 --> 00:37:18,483
Nobody likes
the records you play.

756
00:37:18,551 --> 00:37:19,984
It's completely
whacked... face it!

757
00:37:20,053 --> 00:37:21,486
Face it.

758
00:37:21,554 --> 00:37:22,486
Fuck you!

759
00:37:22,555 --> 00:37:24,489
You might have a chance

760
00:37:24,557 --> 00:37:26,991
if that shit
wasn't so small.

761
00:37:27,060 --> 00:37:28,493
Next!

762
00:37:48,581 --> 00:37:50,515
You ever deejay before?

763
00:37:50,583 --> 00:37:52,016
Yeah, you know,

764
00:37:52,085 --> 00:37:55,020
run away, make tapes
for my boys, stuff like that.

765
00:37:55,088 --> 00:37:56,521
You know what I'm sayin'?

766
00:37:56,589 --> 00:37:58,022
Yeah, you local.

767
00:38:11,538 --> 00:38:13,472
I really
liked your tape.

768
00:38:13,540 --> 00:38:14,472
Thank you.

769
00:38:14,541 --> 00:38:16,475
I'll see you
Saturday night.

770
00:38:16,543 --> 00:38:17,976
What is your name?

771
00:38:18,044 --> 00:38:18,976
GQ.

772
00:38:19,045 --> 00:38:19,977
GQ.

773
00:38:20,046 --> 00:38:21,377
Come on.

774
00:38:25,885 --> 00:38:27,147
Yes!

775
00:38:30,557 --> 00:38:32,991
You know, I think
you and me can be closer

776
00:38:33,059 --> 00:38:34,993
than two craps
together coming out...

777
00:38:35,061 --> 00:38:36,494
What's happen, Trip?

778
00:38:36,563 --> 00:38:37,996
Yo, yo, my brother.

779
00:38:38,064 --> 00:38:40,498
Heard you made that deejay comp.
Congratulations.

780
00:38:40,567 --> 00:38:43,502
GQ. You know
what I'm sayin'?

781
00:38:43,570 --> 00:38:44,662
All right.

782
00:38:52,078 --> 00:38:53,306
What's up, man?

783
00:38:53,379 --> 00:38:55,404
I made that deejay contest
Saturday night.

784
00:38:55,481 --> 00:38:57,506
Once again, it's on.

785
00:38:57,584 --> 00:38:58,846
What you talkin' about?

786
00:38:58,918 --> 00:38:59,942
It's on.

787
00:39:00,019 --> 00:39:02,078
What's this nigger
talkin' about now?

788
00:39:02,155 --> 00:39:04,453
Stickin' up Old Man Quiles
Saturday night.

789
00:39:04,524 --> 00:39:07,618
What? Man, you better
stop bullshittin' me.

790
00:39:07,694 --> 00:39:09,628
I ain't bullshittin' you.
What, is you scared?

791
00:39:09,696 --> 00:39:11,459
Steel ain't scared,
are you, Steel?

792
00:39:11,531 --> 00:39:12,463
Here come Raheem.

793
00:39:12,532 --> 00:39:13,464
Yo, what's up, Q?

794
00:39:13,533 --> 00:39:14,465
What's up, man?

795
00:39:14,534 --> 00:39:15,762
Chillin'.

796
00:39:15,835 --> 00:39:17,268
You got it?

797
00:39:17,337 --> 00:39:19,271
Yeah, I got it.
Come on, let's walk.

798
00:39:19,339 --> 00:39:20,829
What's goin' on
with this garbage?

799
00:39:20,907 --> 00:39:23,239
Check this out.

800
00:39:23,309 --> 00:39:25,209
Oh, shit!

801
00:39:29,048 --> 00:39:30,481
This shit is sweet.

802
00:39:30,550 --> 00:39:32,484
I got it from Sweets.

803
00:39:32,552 --> 00:39:34,486
I ain't never
shot nobody before.

804
00:39:34,554 --> 00:39:37,182
Yo, be careful with that.
It's loaded.

805
00:39:37,256 --> 00:39:39,190
Quiles is not
gonna draw on somebody

806
00:39:39,258 --> 00:39:41,488
that got a gun on him.

807
00:39:41,561 --> 00:39:43,495
It's gonna be
a piece of cake.

808
00:39:43,563 --> 00:39:44,530
A piece of cake.

809
00:39:44,597 --> 00:39:47,031
We go in
right before 11:00,

810
00:39:47,100 --> 00:39:49,295
get the loot, and jet.

811
00:39:49,369 --> 00:39:52,463
The whole thing won't take longer
than three fuckin' minutes.

812
00:39:52,538 --> 00:39:54,768
You decided it
this morning without me?

813
00:39:54,841 --> 00:39:58,333
Yeah. While you was at
your, uh, appointment.

814
00:39:58,411 --> 00:39:59,844
Check this here, man.

815
00:39:59,912 --> 00:40:01,846
I got to deejay
Saturday night.

816
00:40:01,914 --> 00:40:03,438
I'm not missin' that.

817
00:40:03,516 --> 00:40:05,211
Guess you got to
disappoint them.

818
00:40:05,284 --> 00:40:06,945
I ain't disappointin' shit.

819
00:40:07,020 --> 00:40:08,214
Maybe not.

820
00:40:08,287 --> 00:40:11,085
There's going to be
a lot of deejays there, right?

821
00:40:11,157 --> 00:40:12,089
Yeah.

822
00:40:12,158 --> 00:40:14,092
How do they pick
who goes when?

823
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:16,094
There's 40 deejays,
20 sets...

824
00:40:16,162 --> 00:40:18,153
all I know is
I go seventh.

825
00:40:18,231 --> 00:40:20,165
We're going to
need an alibi.

826
00:40:20,233 --> 00:40:21,666
Since you're
going seventh,

827
00:40:21,734 --> 00:40:23,668
that'll give us
an opportunity to go in,

828
00:40:23,736 --> 00:40:25,670
do what we got to do,
and jet.

829
00:40:25,738 --> 00:40:27,672
Get the fuck
out of there.

830
00:40:27,740 --> 00:40:28,707
I think that'll work.

831
00:40:28,775 --> 00:40:30,003
What about the cops?

832
00:40:30,076 --> 00:40:31,509
Bishop checked it out.

833
00:40:31,577 --> 00:40:33,010
There's two
overlappin' patrols

834
00:40:33,079 --> 00:40:34,512
about three minutes apart.

835
00:40:34,580 --> 00:40:36,013
We got to be fast.

836
00:40:36,082 --> 00:40:38,516
Yo, I think we should
plan this another time.

837
00:40:38,584 --> 00:40:40,211
This nigger's scared!

838
00:40:40,286 --> 00:40:42,550
I have to deejay
Saturday night.

839
00:40:42,622 --> 00:40:43,919
Fuck that shit!

840
00:40:43,990 --> 00:40:46,550
We're goin' Saturday night,
and that's it.

841
00:40:46,626 --> 00:40:48,389
I'll hold onto the gun.

842
00:40:48,461 --> 00:40:49,587
Why him?

843
00:40:49,662 --> 00:40:51,857
'Cause I already got it,
motherfucker!

844
00:40:51,931 --> 00:40:54,365
Just let him
hold the gun.

845
00:40:54,434 --> 00:40:56,368
The nigger be
acting stupid.

846
00:40:56,436 --> 00:40:57,368
Shut up!

847
00:40:57,437 --> 00:40:58,369
Suck my dick.

848
00:40:58,438 --> 00:41:00,372
What time you
gotta be there?

849
00:41:00,440 --> 00:41:01,304
Before 9:00.

850
00:41:01,374 --> 00:41:03,308
We'll pick up your shit,

851
00:41:03,376 --> 00:41:05,310
go over there,
set you up...

852
00:41:05,378 --> 00:41:06,777
You'll be straight, man.

853
00:41:08,247 --> 00:41:09,509
<i> Suckers get smacked up</i>

and welcome to
the Mixxmaster Massacre,

861

the ultimate deejay battle
of world supremacy

862
00:41:22,095 --> 00:41:24,029
won by a round
of sudden death

863
00:41:24,097 --> 00:41:26,031
till only the best are left.

864
00:41:26,099 --> 00:41:27,464
Cut it up, y'all.

Hello?

Yo, man, you O.K.?

874
00:41:46,619 --> 00:41:48,052
I'm chillin'.

875
00:41:49,122 --> 00:41:52,057
All right, man,
good luck.

876
00:41:52,125 --> 00:41:53,820

<i>Yo! MTVRaps.</i>

879
00:42:06,239 --> 00:42:07,399
Battles going on,

880
00:42:07,473 --> 00:42:09,998
but each contestant
only has 20 seconds

881
00:42:10,076 --> 00:42:11,338
to go for the gusto.

882
00:42:11,410 --> 00:42:12,570
So let's do it!

883
00:42:44,977 --> 00:42:48,037
Are you having
a good time?

884
00:42:48,114 --> 00:42:50,548
Make some noise.

885
00:42:50,616 --> 00:42:53,346
Somebody say ho.

886
00:42:53,419 --> 00:42:54,852
Ho!

887
00:42:54,921 --> 00:42:55,945
Say ho! Ho!

888
00:42:56,022 --> 00:42:57,387
Ho! Ho!

889
00:42:57,456 --> 00:43:00,220
Yeah! That's the
hyped crowd I like.
