1
00:01:42,334 --> 00:01:44,996
You've got them mixed up.

2
00:01:45,037 --> 00:01:48,268
You're making a mistake.

3
00:01:48,307 --> 00:01:52,471
You're making a mistake
with the reindeer.

4
00:01:52,511 --> 00:01:53,739
Tsk tsk tsk.

5
00:01:57,249 --> 00:02:00,218
Would you mind stepping out
for a moment?

6
00:02:00,252 --> 00:02:01,742
Open the door!

7
00:02:06,425 --> 00:02:07,949
I'm sorry.
The store isn't open today.

8
00:02:07,993 --> 00:02:09,460
I don't want
to buy anything...

9
00:02:09,495 --> 00:02:11,463
and I'm sorry
to interrupt your work...

10
00:02:11,497 --> 00:02:14,295
but I wanted to tell you
you're making a serious mistake.

11
00:02:14,333 --> 00:02:16,665
- Huh?
- With the reindeer, I mean.

12
00:02:16,702 --> 00:02:19,068
You've got Cupid
where Blitzen should be.

13
00:02:19,104 --> 00:02:22,665
And Dasher should be
on my right-hand side.

14
00:02:22,708 --> 00:02:24,403
He should, huh?

15
00:02:24,443 --> 00:02:26,274
Yes. And another thing...

16
00:02:26,312 --> 00:02:29,509
Donner's antlers have got
four points instead of three.

17
00:02:29,548 --> 00:02:32,346
Still, I don't suppose anybody
would notice except myself.

18
00:02:32,384 --> 00:02:34,682
No. I don't suppose so.

19
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:36,551
- Well, bye. Thanks.
- Not at all.

20
00:02:36,589 --> 00:02:39,217
Glad to have helped you. Bye.

21
00:02:39,258 --> 00:02:40,384
Yes.

22
00:02:46,098 --> 00:02:50,057
Jingle bells,
jingle bells...

23
00:03:12,791 --> 00:03:15,157
You're on float number three.

24
00:03:15,194 --> 00:03:17,662
You're on the Pilgrim float.

25
00:03:17,696 --> 00:03:20,665
You're on the pirate float.
You follow the van.

26
00:03:20,699 --> 00:03:22,667
Mrs. Walker,
something's got to be done.

27
00:03:22,701 --> 00:03:24,669
That three-men-in-a-tub float
isn't big enough.

28
00:03:24,703 --> 00:03:26,170
We can get
the butcher and the baker...

29
00:03:26,205 --> 00:03:27,729
I'm awfully sorry...

30
00:03:27,773 --> 00:03:29,673
but I've got enough to do
to take care of the people.

31
00:03:29,708 --> 00:03:31,505
I was hoping you could... George!

32
00:03:54,266 --> 00:03:56,325
I beg your pardon, sir.

33
00:03:56,368 --> 00:03:59,201
You seem to have got mixed up
with this whip of yours.

34
00:03:59,238 --> 00:04:02,332
Allow me, will you?
It's quite simple, really.

35
00:04:02,374 --> 00:04:04,638
- You don't mind if I show you?
- No, sir.

36
00:04:04,677 --> 00:04:05,837
Now, then.

37
00:04:08,681 --> 00:04:11,650
- See? It's all in the wrist.
- Is that so?

38
00:04:11,684 --> 00:04:13,151
Yes, of course.
If you follow through.

39
00:04:13,185 --> 00:04:14,652
Is that so?

40
00:04:14,687 --> 00:04:16,655
It's just like
throwing a ball.

41
00:04:16,689 --> 00:04:20,147
If you were to...
You've been drinking.

42
00:04:20,192 --> 00:04:22,160
Well, it's cold.

43
00:04:22,194 --> 00:04:24,685
A man's got to do something
to keep warm.

44
00:04:24,730 --> 00:04:26,163
You ought
to be ashamed of yourself.

45
00:04:26,198 --> 00:04:28,962
Don't you realize there are
thousands of children...

46
00:04:29,001 --> 00:04:31,435
lining the streets
waiting to see you...

47
00:04:31,470 --> 00:04:34,166
children who have been dreaming
of this moment for weeks?

48
00:04:34,206 --> 00:04:36,174
You're a disgrace to
the tradition of Christmas...

49
00:04:36,208 --> 00:04:38,676
and I refuse to have you
malign me in this fashion.

50
00:04:38,711 --> 00:04:40,702
Disgusting.

51
00:04:40,746 --> 00:04:42,680
Tell me, who's in charge
of this parade?

52
00:04:42,715 --> 00:04:45,183
When you find out, tell me.

53
00:04:45,217 --> 00:04:48,414
These pants are gonna fall off
in Columbus Circle.

54
00:04:51,724 --> 00:04:55,182
I beg your pardon.
Who's in charge here?

55
00:04:55,227 --> 00:04:58,628
Mrs. Walker.
There she is, down there.

56
00:04:58,664 --> 00:05:00,632
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

57
00:05:00,666 --> 00:05:03,226
You two ought to be
over on 81st Street.

58
00:05:03,268 --> 00:05:06,066
Mrs. Walker,
one of the men in your parade...

59
00:05:06,105 --> 00:05:08,130
What are you doing
out of costume?

60
00:05:08,173 --> 00:05:10,198
Get back and get dressed...
Oh, I'm terribly sorry.

61
00:05:10,242 --> 00:05:12,267
I thought
you were our Santa Claus.

62
00:05:12,311 --> 00:05:14,074
Your Santa Claus
is intoxicated.

63
00:05:14,113 --> 00:05:16,308
- Oh, no!
- Yes. It's disgraceful.

64
00:05:16,348 --> 00:05:19,044
How can you allow a man
to get into such a position?

65
00:05:20,419 --> 00:05:23,616
Jingle bells, jingle bells...

66
00:05:23,656 --> 00:05:25,248
Stop that!
What do you mean by drinking?

67
00:05:25,290 --> 00:05:27,190
You know it's not allowed.

68
00:05:27,226 --> 00:05:29,490
A man's got to do
something to keep warm.

69
00:05:29,528 --> 00:05:31,860
I'll warm you.
I ought to take this cane...

70
00:05:31,897 --> 00:05:34,957
Somebody, Julian,
get some black coffee...

71
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,160
plenty of it, too.

72
00:05:36,201 --> 00:05:37,463
Yes, Mrs. Walker.

73
00:05:37,503 --> 00:05:40,097
Black with a little cream.

74
00:05:40,139 --> 00:05:42,300
Wake me up
when the parade starts.

75
00:05:42,341 --> 00:05:45,310
Jingle bells, jingle bells

76
00:05:45,344 --> 00:05:48,279
Jingle all the way

77
00:05:52,184 --> 00:05:55,551
Shameful! Absolutely shameful!

78
00:05:55,587 --> 00:05:57,987
Could you be Santa Claus?

79
00:05:58,023 --> 00:05:59,854
Have you had any experience?

80
00:05:59,892 --> 00:06:01,154
Oh, a little.

81
00:06:01,193 --> 00:06:03,423
Oh, please.
You've got to help me out.

82
00:06:03,462 --> 00:06:05,453
I am not in the habit
of substituting...

83
00:06:05,497 --> 00:06:07,488
for spurious Santa Clauses.

84
00:06:07,533 --> 00:06:09,194
- Oh, please.
- No, I...

85
00:06:11,136 --> 00:06:14,105
Well, the children
mustn't be disappointed.

86
00:06:14,139 --> 00:06:15,834
All right, I'll do it.

87
00:06:15,874 --> 00:06:18,604
Oh, good. Thank you.
Come right this way.

88
00:06:18,644 --> 00:06:20,771
Get that costume.

89
00:06:57,516 --> 00:06:59,211
Wonderful!
He's the best we've ever had...

90
00:06:59,251 --> 00:07:00,718
and he didn't need any padding.

91
00:07:00,753 --> 00:07:01,879
What?

92
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:04,218
He didn't need padding.
Where did you find him?

93
00:07:04,256 --> 00:07:05,917
I just turned round,
and there he was.

94
00:07:05,958 --> 00:07:08,654
I'm glad you turned round.

95
00:07:08,694 --> 00:07:10,855
Just think if Mr. Macy
had seen the other one!

96
00:07:10,896 --> 00:07:13,922
Just think if Mr. Gimbel
had seen the other one.

97
00:07:13,966 --> 00:07:16,161
You want to ride
in the motorcycle or a car?

98
00:07:16,201 --> 00:07:18,066
No. I'm going home
and get in a hot tub...

99
00:07:18,103 --> 00:07:19,730
and I might stay there
until next Thanksgiving.

100
00:07:19,772 --> 00:07:22,104
You should see it.
You worked so hard.

101
00:07:22,141 --> 00:07:23,665
If I want to, which I doubt...

102
00:07:23,709 --> 00:07:26,177
I can see it from
the roof of my apartment.

103
00:07:26,211 --> 00:07:27,940
That's right,
you live down the...

104
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:29,447
Mrs. Walker!

105
00:08:02,147 --> 00:08:03,307
Susan!

106
00:08:09,221 --> 00:08:10,813
Susan?

107
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:17,087
- Hello, Cleo.
- Hello, Mrs. Walker.

108
00:08:17,129 --> 00:08:18,824
What a beauty.
Where's Susan?

109
00:08:18,864 --> 00:08:20,923
She's watching the parade.

110
00:08:20,966 --> 00:08:22,934
Where? With whom?

111
00:08:22,968 --> 00:08:26,426
With that Mr. Gailey
in the front apartment.

112
00:08:26,471 --> 00:08:27,961
Oh, yes.

113
00:08:30,475 --> 00:08:32,067
I've been keeping
an eye on her.

114
00:08:32,110 --> 00:08:34,101
She can see everything
from there.

115
00:08:34,146 --> 00:08:35,545
That's the 50 yard line.

116
00:08:35,581 --> 00:08:37,742
He's so very fond of Susan.

117
00:08:37,783 --> 00:08:39,684
When he asked me,
I didn't think you'd mind.

118
00:08:39,817 --> 00:08:41,910
Well, I guess it's all right.

119
00:08:41,952 --> 00:08:44,182
I'll go on in a minute.

120
00:08:44,221 --> 00:08:46,815
Looks like they're
having a little trouble...

121
00:08:46,857 --> 00:08:48,222
with the baseball player.

122
00:08:48,259 --> 00:08:49,954
He was a clown last year.

123
00:08:49,994 --> 00:08:52,462
They just changed the head
and painted him different.

124
00:08:52,496 --> 00:08:53,827
My mother told me.

125
00:08:53,864 --> 00:08:57,197
He certainly is a giant,
isn't he?

126
00:08:57,234 --> 00:09:00,067
Not really.
There are no giants, Mr. Gailey.

127
00:09:00,104 --> 00:09:02,766
Maybe not now, Suzie...

128
00:09:02,807 --> 00:09:05,435
but in olden days,
there were a lot of...

129
00:09:08,345 --> 00:09:10,210
What about the giant
that Jack killed?

130
00:09:10,247 --> 00:09:13,580
Jack? Jack who?

131
00:09:13,617 --> 00:09:14,777
Jack...

132
00:09:17,688 --> 00:09:19,588
Jack!

133
00:09:19,623 --> 00:09:21,591
"Jack and the Beanstalk."

134
00:09:21,625 --> 00:09:23,593
I never heard of that.

135
00:09:23,627 --> 00:09:25,424
You must've heard that.
You've just forgotten.

136
00:09:25,463 --> 00:09:27,124
It's a fairy tale.

137
00:09:27,164 --> 00:09:30,497
Oh, one of those.
I don't know any.

138
00:09:30,534 --> 00:09:35,096
Your mother and father
must have told you a fairy tale.

139
00:09:35,139 --> 00:09:37,266
No. My mother thinks
they're silly.

140
00:09:37,308 --> 00:09:40,106
I don't know whether my father
thinks they're silly or not.

141
00:09:40,144 --> 00:09:41,941
I never met my father.

142
00:09:41,979 --> 00:09:45,210
My father and mother were
divorced when I was a baby.

143
00:09:49,019 --> 00:09:51,817
Well, that baseball player
looks like a giant to me.

144
00:09:51,856 --> 00:09:55,553
People sometimes grow very big,
but that's abnormal.

145
00:09:55,593 --> 00:09:58,187
I'll bet your mother
told you that, too.

146
00:10:06,237 --> 00:10:08,398
Hello.
I'm Susan's mother.

147
00:10:08,439 --> 00:10:10,464
Yes, I know.
Won't you come in?

148
00:10:10,508 --> 00:10:12,908
Suzie's told me quite a lot
about you. I'm Fred Gailey.

149
00:10:12,943 --> 00:10:14,069
Yes, I know.

150
00:10:14,111 --> 00:10:16,102
Susan's told me quite
a lot about you, too.

151
00:10:16,147 --> 00:10:19,480
- Hello, Mother!
- Hello, dear.

152
00:10:19,517 --> 00:10:23,180
A cup of coffee?
You must be half frozen.

153
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:25,780
- Oh, don't bother.
- It's all ready.

154
00:10:25,823 --> 00:10:28,724
In that case, thanks.
What do you think of my parade?

155
00:10:28,759 --> 00:10:30,727
It's much better
than last year's.

156
00:10:30,761 --> 00:10:32,422
Well, I hope
Mr. Macy agrees with you.

157
00:10:32,463 --> 00:10:35,728
Sugar? Cream?
Both? Neither?

158
00:10:35,766 --> 00:10:37,893
Just one sugar, please.

159
00:10:40,437 --> 00:10:42,166
This is very kind of you,
Mr. Gailey.

160
00:10:42,206 --> 00:10:43,468
Sit down.

161
00:10:43,507 --> 00:10:45,498
I want to thank you
for being so kind to Susan.

162
00:10:45,543 --> 00:10:48,740
Cleo tells me you took them
to the zoo yesterday.

163
00:10:48,779 --> 00:10:50,906
That's right,
but I must confess.

164
00:10:50,948 --> 00:10:53,678
It's part of a deep-dyed plot.

165
00:10:53,717 --> 00:10:59,019
I'm fond of Suzie, very fond,
but I also wanted to meet you.

166
00:10:59,056 --> 00:11:01,616
I read someplace the surest way
to meet the mother...

167
00:11:01,659 --> 00:11:03,388
is to be kind to the child.

168
00:11:03,427 --> 00:11:05,520
What a horrible trick.

169
00:11:05,563 --> 00:11:07,531
It worked.

170
00:11:07,565 --> 00:11:09,692
There goes Santa Claus.

171
00:11:09,733 --> 00:11:12,600
Oh, don't even
mention the name.

172
00:11:12,636 --> 00:11:14,934
He's much better
than last year's.

173
00:11:14,972 --> 00:11:17,338
At least this one
doesn't wear glasses.

174
00:11:17,374 --> 00:11:19,467
This one was
a last-minute substitute.

175
00:11:19,510 --> 00:11:21,478
The one I hired I fired.

176
00:11:21,512 --> 00:11:22,809
Why?

177
00:11:22,847 --> 00:11:25,748
You remember
the janitor last New Year's?

178
00:11:25,783 --> 00:11:27,978
Ohh, yes.

179
00:11:28,018 --> 00:11:31,078
Well,
this one was much worse.

180
00:11:31,121 --> 00:11:32,383
Oh.

181
00:11:32,423 --> 00:11:35,085
I see she doesn't
believe in Santa Claus, either.

182
00:11:35,125 --> 00:11:37,923
No Santa Claus,
no fairy tales...

183
00:11:37,962 --> 00:11:41,193
no fantasies of any kind,
is that it?

184
00:11:41,232 --> 00:11:43,996
That's right.
We should be realistic...

185
00:11:44,034 --> 00:11:46,002
and completely truthful
with our children...

186
00:11:46,036 --> 00:11:47,503
and not have them growing up
believing in...

187
00:11:47,538 --> 00:11:51,668
a lot of legends and myths
like Santa Claus, for example.

188
00:11:51,709 --> 00:11:53,006
I see.

189
00:11:53,043 --> 00:11:56,444
That's the end.
The acrobats were good.

190
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:58,505
They ought to be
at those prices.

191
00:11:58,549 --> 00:12:00,346
Thanks for the coffee.

192
00:12:00,384 --> 00:12:02,614
And thank you
for inviting me in.

193
00:12:02,653 --> 00:12:05,053
It was a pleasure, missy.

194
00:12:05,089 --> 00:12:06,579
Mother, I was thinking...

195
00:12:06,624 --> 00:12:08,615
we've got such
a big turkey for dinner...

196
00:12:08,659 --> 00:12:10,627
and there are only two of us.

197
00:12:10,661 --> 00:12:13,789
Couldn't we invite Mr. Gailey?

198
00:12:13,831 --> 00:12:15,696
Oh, don't even
think about it.

199
00:12:15,733 --> 00:12:17,860
I'll have a sandwich
or something.

200
00:12:17,902 --> 00:12:19,870
It's an awful big turkey.

201
00:12:19,904 --> 00:12:21,132
That's not it, dear...

202
00:12:21,171 --> 00:12:23,833
but I'm sure Mr. Gailey
has other plans.

203
00:12:23,874 --> 00:12:26,001
No, he hasn't. Have you?

204
00:12:26,043 --> 00:12:29,376
To be quite honest
and truthful with the child...

205
00:12:29,413 --> 00:12:31,074
I must admit
I haven't any other plans.

206
00:12:31,115 --> 00:12:33,310
Please, Mother!

207
00:12:33,350 --> 00:12:34,908
Did I ask all right?

208
00:12:34,952 --> 00:12:36,146
Hmm?

209
00:12:40,958 --> 00:12:43,256
Didn't I ask all right,
Mr. Gailey?

210
00:12:43,294 --> 00:12:45,888
That all depends.

211
00:12:47,564 --> 00:12:49,191
Dinner's at 3:00.

212
00:12:49,233 --> 00:12:51,224
Thanks.

213
00:12:51,268 --> 00:12:53,668
Suzie, honey,
you asked just right.

214
00:12:53,704 --> 00:12:55,535
I'll see you at 3:00.

215
00:12:56,540 --> 00:12:59,031
- It worked.
- Yes.

216
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:06,108
I tell you,
Mrs. Walker, he's stupendous.

217
00:13:06,150 --> 00:13:08,277
Everybody's crazy about him.
So is Mr. Macy.

218
00:13:08,319 --> 00:13:10,219
Well, hire him,
by all means.

219
00:13:10,254 --> 00:13:11,778
It's perfectly
all right with me.

220
00:13:11,822 --> 00:13:15,155
It'll save me a frantic search
in the morning.

221
00:13:17,161 --> 00:13:19,220
Yes. That's right.

222
00:13:19,263 --> 00:13:21,356
I'll take care of it as soon
as he gets through.

223
00:13:21,398 --> 00:13:22,524
You'll love him.

224
00:13:22,566 --> 00:13:24,295
I just know that
with that man on the throne...

225
00:13:24,335 --> 00:13:26,360
my department will sell
more toys than it ever has.

226
00:13:26,403 --> 00:13:28,394
He's a born salesman.
I just feel it.

227
00:13:28,439 --> 00:13:29,701
Yes, yes, yes.

228
00:13:29,740 --> 00:13:31,833
We'll talk about it
in the morning. Good-bye.

229
00:13:31,875 --> 00:13:33,035
Good-bye.

230
00:13:34,578 --> 00:13:39,208
And you'll find toys
of all kinds at Macy's.

231
00:13:52,196 --> 00:13:54,494
Gee, that sure is
an elegant costume.

232
00:13:54,531 --> 00:13:58,900
Yes. I've had it
for years and years.

233
00:13:58,936 --> 00:14:01,769
Sure makes a bum
out of the one they gave you.

234
00:14:01,805 --> 00:14:03,796
Even that one's better
than the one I wear.

235
00:14:03,841 --> 00:14:05,103
You, Alfred?

236
00:14:05,142 --> 00:14:08,043
I play Santa Claus
over at the "Y" near our block.

237
00:14:08,078 --> 00:14:09,204
No kidding!

238
00:14:09,246 --> 00:14:11,214
Started about three years ago.

239
00:14:11,248 --> 00:14:15,446
They had a costume,
but it didn't have no padding...

240
00:14:15,486 --> 00:14:17,954
and since I carry my own
padding around with me...

241
00:14:17,988 --> 00:14:19,546
I got the job, see?

242
00:14:21,158 --> 00:14:23,149
You enjoy impersonating me?

243
00:14:23,193 --> 00:14:26,185
- Oh, yeah.
- Why?

244
00:14:26,230 --> 00:14:28,460
I don't know. It's...

245
00:14:28,499 --> 00:14:30,865
When I give packages
to little kids...

246
00:14:30,901 --> 00:14:33,597
I like to watch
their faces get that...

247
00:14:33,637 --> 00:14:35,628
that Christmas look
all of a sudden.

248
00:14:35,672 --> 00:14:38,505
It makes me feel
kind of good and important.

249
00:14:43,013 --> 00:14:44,480
Pardon me!

250
00:14:44,515 --> 00:14:46,244
I bought
a 23-pound turkey.

251
00:14:46,283 --> 00:14:49,548
I had my daughter and her kids
over for dinner yesterday.

252
00:14:52,656 --> 00:14:54,681
There you are.

253
00:14:54,725 --> 00:14:55,851
Good morning.

254
00:14:55,893 --> 00:14:58,487
Oh, my,
what a striking costume!

255
00:14:58,529 --> 00:15:00,656
Before you go up on the floor,
I want to give you...

256
00:15:00,697 --> 00:15:02,700
a few tips on how to be
a good Santa Claus.

257
00:15:02,833 --> 00:15:04,061
Go right ahead.

258
00:15:04,101 --> 00:15:06,934
Here's a list
of toys that we have to push.

259
00:15:06,970 --> 00:15:09,632
You know, things
that we're overstocked on.

260
00:15:09,673 --> 00:15:11,140
Now, you'll find
that a great many children...

261
00:15:11,175 --> 00:15:13,575
will be undecided as to what
they want for Christmas.

262
00:15:13,610 --> 00:15:18,070
When that happens,
you suggest one of these items.

263
00:15:18,115 --> 00:15:19,241
You understand?

264
00:15:19,283 --> 00:15:20,978
I certainly do.

265
00:15:21,018 --> 00:15:23,987
Good.
You memorize that list...

266
00:15:24,021 --> 00:15:25,989
Oh, no. 9:50.

267
00:15:26,023 --> 00:15:28,491
When you've finished,
come up to the seventh floor.

268
00:15:28,525 --> 00:15:29,924
I'll be waiting for you.

269
00:15:32,529 --> 00:15:34,292
Imagine...

270
00:15:34,331 --> 00:15:37,198
making a child take something
it doesn't want...

271
00:15:37,234 --> 00:15:40,328
just because he bought
too many of the wrong toys.

272
00:15:40,370 --> 00:15:43,430
That's what I've been
fighting against for years...

273
00:15:43,474 --> 00:15:45,465
the way they
commercialize Christmas.

274
00:15:45,509 --> 00:15:48,672
A lot of bad "isms"
floating around this worid...

275
00:15:48,712 --> 00:15:50,612
but one of the worst
is commercialism.

276
00:15:50,647 --> 00:15:52,342
Make a buck. Make a buck.

277
00:15:52,382 --> 00:15:54,350
Even in Brooklyn,
it's the same.

278
00:15:54,384 --> 00:15:56,545
Don't care what Christmas
stands for.

279
00:15:56,587 --> 00:15:59,055
Just make a buck.

280
00:15:59,089 --> 00:16:01,148
Oh, don't bother.
I'll put it away for you.

281
00:16:01,191 --> 00:16:03,352
Eh?
Oh, thank you, Alfred.

282
00:16:05,329 --> 00:16:06,728
And what should I do
with these?

283
00:16:06,764 --> 00:16:08,789
Throw them on the floor.

284
00:16:08,832 --> 00:16:11,027
I get kind of tired
just sweeping up dust.

285
00:16:11,068 --> 00:16:12,262
Mm-hmm.

286
00:16:13,504 --> 00:16:16,337
- Thanks.
- Well, thank you, Alfred.

287
00:16:23,347 --> 00:16:26,976
Yes, yes, yes.
Peter's a fine name.

288
00:16:27,017 --> 00:16:28,382
What do you want
for Christmas, Peter?

289
00:16:28,418 --> 00:16:31,819
A fire engine, just like
the big ones only smaller...

290
00:16:31,855 --> 00:16:33,846
that has a real hose
that squirts real water.

291
00:16:33,891 --> 00:16:36,655
I won't do it in the house,
only in the backyard.

292
00:16:36,693 --> 00:16:38,285
I promise.

293
00:16:38,328 --> 00:16:39,989
Psst! Psst!

294
00:16:40,030 --> 00:16:43,056
Macy's ain't got any.
Nobody's got any.

295
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:45,660
Well, Peter,
I can tell you're a good boy.

296
00:16:45,702 --> 00:16:46,930
You'll get your fire engine.

297
00:16:46,970 --> 00:16:49,837
Oh, thank you very much!

298
00:16:49,873 --> 00:16:53,104
You see?
I told you he'd get me one.

299
00:16:53,143 --> 00:16:55,111
That's fine.
That's just dandy.

300
00:16:55,145 --> 00:16:56,669
Listen, you wait over there.

301
00:16:56,713 --> 00:17:00,149
Mama wants to thank
Santa Claus, too.

302
00:17:00,184 --> 00:17:02,618
Say, listen,
what's the matter with you?

303
00:17:02,653 --> 00:17:04,143
Don't you understand English?

304
00:17:04,188 --> 00:17:07,180
I tell you nobody's got any.

305
00:17:07,224 --> 00:17:09,522
I've been all over.
My feet are killing me.

306
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:11,528
A fine thing, promising the kid.

307
00:17:11,562 --> 00:17:14,895
You don't think I would've
said that unless I'm sure?

308
00:17:14,932 --> 00:17:18,732
You can get those fire engines
at Schoenfeld's on Lexington.

309
00:17:18,769 --> 00:17:20,703
Only 8.50. A wonderful bargain.

310
00:17:20,737 --> 00:17:23,103
Schoenfeld's?
I don't get it.

311
00:17:23,140 --> 00:17:25,973
I keep track of
the toy market pretty closely.

312
00:17:26,009 --> 00:17:27,340
Does that surprise you so?

313
00:17:27,377 --> 00:17:28,969
Surprise me?

314
00:17:29,012 --> 00:17:31,503
Macy's sending people
to other stores?

315
00:17:31,548 --> 00:17:32,845
Are you kidding me?

316
00:17:32,883 --> 00:17:35,818
The only important thing
is to make the children happy.

317
00:17:35,853 --> 00:17:38,913
Who sells the toy
doesn't make any difference.

318
00:17:38,956 --> 00:17:40,514
Don't you feel that way?

319
00:17:40,557 --> 00:17:43,025
Who, me? Oh, yeah, sure.

320
00:17:43,060 --> 00:17:44,789
Only I didn't know Macy's did.

321
00:17:44,828 --> 00:17:46,591
As long as I'm here, they do.

322
00:17:46,630 --> 00:17:48,495
I don't get it.

323
00:17:48,532 --> 00:17:52,059
No, I just don't get it.

324
00:18:12,823 --> 00:18:14,290
I quite understand.

325
00:18:14,324 --> 00:18:16,121
Your little girl
would like some skates.

326
00:18:16,159 --> 00:18:17,751
But of course,
you must get her the best...

327
00:18:17,794 --> 00:18:20,194
'cause their little ankles
want protecting.

328
00:18:20,230 --> 00:18:23,597
Our skates are very good,
but not quite good enough.

329
00:18:23,634 --> 00:18:25,659
You go to Gimbels.

330
00:18:25,702 --> 00:18:27,226
They'll have exactly what
you're looking for.

331
00:18:27,271 --> 00:18:29,637
There you are, dear.
That's for you.

332
00:18:29,673 --> 00:18:30,799
Merry Christmas.

333
00:18:30,841 --> 00:18:32,001
Gimbels.

334
00:18:32,042 --> 00:18:35,705
Hello, my little girl.
How old are you?

335
00:18:37,881 --> 00:18:40,111
Gimbels.

336
00:18:40,150 --> 00:18:42,311
Gimbels!

337
00:18:42,352 --> 00:18:44,183
Pardon me.
The guard said to speak to you.

338
00:18:44,221 --> 00:18:45,688
You're the head
of the toy department?

339
00:18:45,722 --> 00:18:47,189
Yes, madam...

340
00:18:47,224 --> 00:18:49,920
Listen. I want to
congratulate you and Macy's...

341
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:52,485
on this wonderful new stunt
you're pulling.

342
00:18:52,529 --> 00:18:55,123
Imagine, sending people
to other stores.

343
00:18:55,165 --> 00:18:56,826
I don't get it. Why, it's...

344
00:18:56,867 --> 00:18:59,427
- It certainly is.
- You said it.

345
00:18:59,469 --> 00:19:01,596
Imagine a big outfit
like Macy's...

346
00:19:01,638 --> 00:19:04,163
putting the spirit of Christmas
ahead of the commercial.

347
00:19:04,207 --> 00:19:06,004
It's wonderful.

348
00:19:06,043 --> 00:19:08,102
I never done
much shopping here before...

349
00:19:08,145 --> 00:19:12,343
but from now on, I'm going
to be a regular Macy customer.

350
00:19:12,382 --> 00:19:13,781
All right, dear.

351
00:19:13,817 --> 00:19:15,444
Thank you, madam.

352
00:19:18,855 --> 00:19:21,756
There are six more
women who want to thank you.

353
00:19:21,792 --> 00:19:25,057
Not now. I've got
to think this thing over.

354
00:19:25,095 --> 00:19:28,223
Personally, I think
it's a wonderful idea, too.

355
00:19:28,265 --> 00:19:31,132
You think so.
Those women think so.

356
00:19:31,168 --> 00:19:34,103
The point is,
will Mr. Macy think so?

357
00:19:37,341 --> 00:19:40,469
This seems awfully silly,
Mr. Gailey.

358
00:19:40,510 --> 00:19:43,274
I thought as long
as we're in the store...

359
00:19:43,313 --> 00:19:45,474
you might as well
say hello to Santa Claus.

360
00:19:45,515 --> 00:19:46,982
Why?

361
00:19:47,017 --> 00:19:49,144
Because when
you talk to him...

362
00:19:49,186 --> 00:19:51,279
you might feel
differently about him.

363
00:19:56,860 --> 00:19:59,829
Good-bye, Elmer.
Be a good boy now.

364
00:19:59,863 --> 00:20:01,125
Merry Christmas!

365
00:20:02,199 --> 00:20:03,689
Well, young lady,
what's your name?

366
00:20:03,734 --> 00:20:05,895
Susan Walker.
What's yours?

367
00:20:05,936 --> 00:20:08,131
Mine? Kris Kringle.

368
00:20:08,171 --> 00:20:10,139
I'm Santa Claus.

369
00:20:10,173 --> 00:20:13,506
Oh, you don't believe that,
do you?

370
00:20:13,543 --> 00:20:17,604
My mother's Mrs. Walker,
the lady who hired you.

371
00:20:17,647 --> 00:20:19,114
Oh.

372
00:20:19,149 --> 00:20:22,209
But I must say,
you're the best one I've seen.

373
00:20:22,252 --> 00:20:23,514
Really?

374
00:20:23,553 --> 00:20:26,113
Your beard doesn't have
those things over your ears.

375
00:20:26,156 --> 00:20:29,319
That's because it's real,
like I'm really Santa Claus.

376
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:32,528
Oh, go ahead, pull it.

377
00:20:33,830 --> 00:20:35,161
Ouch.

378
00:20:37,901 --> 00:20:39,835
All right, folks,
don't crowd.

379
00:20:39,870 --> 00:20:41,531
You have all day
to see Santa Claus.

380
00:20:41,571 --> 00:20:43,937
Now, children, behave.
This way, please.

381
00:20:43,974 --> 00:20:45,373
Get back in the line there.

382
00:20:45,409 --> 00:20:48,435
What would you like me
to bring you for Christmas?

383
00:20:48,478 --> 00:20:50,378
Nothing, thank you.

384
00:20:50,414 --> 00:20:52,609
Oh, come now.
You must want something.

385
00:20:52,649 --> 00:20:54,981
Whatever I want,
my mother will get for me...

386
00:20:55,018 --> 00:20:57,486
if it's sensible and doesn't
cost too much, of course.

387
00:20:57,521 --> 00:20:58,647
Hello, Mother.

388
00:20:58,688 --> 00:21:00,121
Hello, Susan, Mr. Gailey.

389
00:21:00,157 --> 00:21:03,490
I think you've taken up enough
of this gentleman's time.

390
00:21:03,527 --> 00:21:06,826
The explanation for this
is all very simple.

391
00:21:06,863 --> 00:21:08,490
Cleo's mother
sprained her ankle.

392
00:21:08,532 --> 00:21:11,000
She had to go home and asked me
to bring Suzie down to you.

393
00:21:11,034 --> 00:21:13,525
Yes, Cleo called me.
I was wondering where you were.

394
00:21:13,570 --> 00:21:16,232
As long as we're here,
we should say hello to Santa.

395
00:21:16,273 --> 00:21:19,970
He's a nice old man,
and those whiskers are real.

396
00:21:20,010 --> 00:21:22,979
Yes, dear. Many men
have long beards like that.

397
00:21:23,013 --> 00:21:24,844
Susan, would you stand
over here a minute?

398
00:21:24,881 --> 00:21:27,349
I want to talk to Mr. Gailey.

399
00:21:27,384 --> 00:21:30,353
I shouldn't have brought
Suzie to see Santa Claus?

400
00:21:30,387 --> 00:21:33,322
You're making me feel
like the proverbial stepmother.

401
00:21:33,356 --> 00:21:35,517
I'm sorry, but I just
couldn't see any harm...

402
00:21:35,559 --> 00:21:37,459
in just saying hello
to the old fellow.

403
00:21:37,494 --> 00:21:39,359
But I think there is harm.

404
00:21:39,396 --> 00:21:41,990
I tell her Santa Claus is
a myth, you bring her here...

405
00:21:42,032 --> 00:21:44,159
and she sees hundreds
of gullible children...

406
00:21:44,201 --> 00:21:47,102
meets a very convincing
old man with real whiskers.

407
00:21:47,137 --> 00:21:50,368
This sets up a very harmful
mental conflict within her.

408
00:21:50,407 --> 00:21:53,069
What is she going to think?
Who is she going to believe?

409
00:21:58,715 --> 00:22:00,205
And by filling them
full of fairy tales...

410
00:22:00,250 --> 00:22:03,651
they grow up considering life
a fantasy instead of a reality.

411
00:22:03,687 --> 00:22:06,656
They keep waiting for
Prince Charming to come along.

412
00:22:06,690 --> 00:22:08,658
And when he does,
he turns out to be a...

413
00:22:08,692 --> 00:22:11,490
We were talking
about Suzie, not about you.

414
00:22:11,528 --> 00:22:13,325
Whether you agree or not...

415
00:22:13,363 --> 00:22:16,594
I must ask you to respect
my wishes regarding Susan.

416
00:22:16,633 --> 00:22:18,430
She's my responsibility...

417
00:22:18,468 --> 00:22:20,333
and I must bring her up
as I see fit.

418
00:22:20,370 --> 00:22:21,530
OK.

419
00:22:29,346 --> 00:22:31,337
- Say "Thank you."
- Thank you.

420
00:22:31,381 --> 00:22:33,076
Bye. Merry Christmas!

421
00:22:35,652 --> 00:22:37,779
Well, young lady,
what's your name?

422
00:22:37,821 --> 00:22:39,914
I'm sorry.
She doesn't speak English.

423
00:22:39,956 --> 00:22:42,754
She's Dutch. She just came over.

424
00:22:42,792 --> 00:22:44,851
She's been living
in an orphans home...

425
00:22:44,894 --> 00:22:47,522
in Rotterdam ever since...

426
00:22:47,564 --> 00:22:48,792
We've adopted her.

427
00:22:48,832 --> 00:22:51,323
I told her you wouldn't
be able to speak to her...

428
00:22:51,368 --> 00:22:53,336
but when she saw you
in the parade yesterday...

429
00:22:53,370 --> 00:22:55,998
she said you were
"Sinter Claes"...

430
00:22:56,039 --> 00:22:57,973
and you could talk to her.

431
00:22:58,008 --> 00:22:59,134
I didn't know what to do.

432
00:22:59,175 --> 00:23:02,144
Hello.

433
00:23:48,391 --> 00:23:50,018
Now do you understand?

434
00:23:50,060 --> 00:23:51,857
Yes, I see what
you mean, Mother.

435
00:23:51,895 --> 00:23:53,123
Good.

436
00:23:53,163 --> 00:23:56,564
But when he spoke Dutch
to that girl, he was so...

437
00:23:56,599 --> 00:24:00,057
Susan, I speak French,
but I'm not Joan of Arc.

438
00:24:00,103 --> 00:24:03,072
What I'm trying
to explain is... Come in.

439
00:24:03,106 --> 00:24:04,937
They said you wanted
to see me, Mrs. Walker.

440
00:24:04,974 --> 00:24:06,441
Come right in.

441
00:24:06,476 --> 00:24:08,034
Hello there!
Good to see you again.

442
00:24:08,078 --> 00:24:09,443
It's nice to see you.

443
00:24:09,479 --> 00:24:10,878
You're awfully lucky,
Mrs. Walker.

444
00:24:10,914 --> 00:24:12,643
Lovely little girl
you have here.

445
00:24:12,682 --> 00:24:15,617
Thank you. Susan's why
I asked you to drop down.

446
00:24:15,652 --> 00:24:16,949
She's a little confused...

447
00:24:16,986 --> 00:24:18,510
and I thought you could help
straighten her out.

448
00:24:18,555 --> 00:24:19,817
Oh, glad to.

449
00:24:19,856 --> 00:24:23,690
Would you please tell her
you're not really Santa Claus...

450
00:24:23,727 --> 00:24:26,355
that there actually
is no such person?

451
00:24:26,396 --> 00:24:28,330
I'm sorry to disagree
with you, Mrs. Walker.

452
00:24:28,364 --> 00:24:31,197
Not only is there such a person,
but here I am to prove it.

453
00:24:31,234 --> 00:24:33,293
No, you misunderstand.

454
00:24:33,336 --> 00:24:36,305
I want you to tell her
the truth. What's your name?

455
00:24:36,339 --> 00:24:38,364
Kris Kringle. I'll bet
you're in the first grade.

456
00:24:38,408 --> 00:24:39,534
Second.

457
00:24:39,576 --> 00:24:41,203
I mean your real name.

458
00:24:41,244 --> 00:24:43,508
That is my real name.
Second grade?

459
00:24:43,546 --> 00:24:44,945
It's a progressive school.

460
00:24:44,981 --> 00:24:47,643
Oh,
it's a progressive school.

461
00:24:47,684 --> 00:24:50,084
May I have this man's
employment card, please?

462
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:51,246
Yes, Mrs. Walker.

463
00:24:51,287 --> 00:24:52,720
This dress is very cute.

464
00:24:52,756 --> 00:24:54,621
Where did you get
such a lovely outfit?

465
00:24:54,657 --> 00:24:57,387
Here at Macy's.
We get 10% off.

466
00:24:57,427 --> 00:25:00,396
Please don't feel
you have to pretend for Susan.

467
00:25:00,430 --> 00:25:02,364
She's a very
intelligent child...

468
00:25:02,398 --> 00:25:04,491
and always wants to know
the absolute truth.

469
00:25:04,534 --> 00:25:06,434
Good, because I always
tell the absolute truth.

470
00:25:06,469 --> 00:25:09,461
About your school...
What's the name of your teacher?

471
00:25:09,506 --> 00:25:11,599
Mrs. Haley.

472
00:25:11,641 --> 00:25:14,235
- Here it is, Mrs. Walker.
- Thank you.

473
00:25:14,277 --> 00:25:16,643
What else do you do
besides read and play games?

474
00:25:16,679 --> 00:25:19,842
We have rest periods
for one half-hour.

475
00:25:19,883 --> 00:25:21,976
I don't suppose
you care for that, eh?

476
00:25:22,018 --> 00:25:25,146
No. We're not allowed
to talk or anything.

477
00:25:25,188 --> 00:25:28,624
Tuesday, Chester Richards
kept talking all the time.

478
00:25:28,658 --> 00:25:30,717
My, that was bad, eh?

479
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:34,287
Mrs. Haley made him rest
all alone for nearly an hour.

480
00:25:34,330 --> 00:25:38,494
Susan, would you go out
and talk to Miss Adams?

481
00:25:38,535 --> 00:25:40,162
I'll be right with you.

482
00:25:40,203 --> 00:25:41,670
All right. Good-bye.

483
00:25:41,704 --> 00:25:43,501
Good-bye, young lady.
Hope to see you again.

484
00:25:43,540 --> 00:25:45,838
Thank you.
I hope so, too. Bye.

485
00:25:45,875 --> 00:25:47,001
Good-bye.

486
00:25:47,043 --> 00:25:50,501
I'm sorry, Mr., uh... Mr...

487
00:25:50,547 --> 00:25:51,844
Kringle.

488
00:25:51,881 --> 00:25:53,849
I'm sorry, but we're
going to have to make a change.

489
00:25:53,883 --> 00:25:55,009
Change?

490
00:25:55,051 --> 00:25:57,178
The Santa Claus
that we had two years ago...

491
00:25:57,220 --> 00:25:59,347
is back in town,
and I feel we owe it to him...

492
00:25:59,389 --> 00:26:00,856
Have I done something wrong?

493
00:26:00,890 --> 00:26:02,949
Oh, no, no.

494
00:26:02,992 --> 00:26:04,619
Well...

495
00:26:06,262 --> 00:26:07,388
Yes?

496
00:26:07,430 --> 00:26:09,955
Mr. Macy wants
to see you immediately.

497
00:26:09,999 --> 00:26:11,489
I'll be right up.

498
00:26:13,503 --> 00:26:15,164
Would you sit down...

499
00:26:15,205 --> 00:26:18,299
and I'll be right back
and sign your pay voucher.

500
00:26:20,009 --> 00:26:21,476
Yes, indeed.

501
00:26:21,511 --> 00:26:25,038
Go right in.
Mr. Macy's waiting.

502
00:26:26,549 --> 00:26:29,017
The effect this will
have on the public is...

503
00:26:29,052 --> 00:26:30,451
Come in, Mrs. Walker.

504
00:26:30,486 --> 00:26:34,286
- Hello, Mrs. Walker.
- Sit over here.

505
00:26:34,324 --> 00:26:37,452
I've been telling these
gentlemen the new policy...

506
00:26:37,493 --> 00:26:39,154
you and Mr. Shellhammer
initiated.

507
00:26:39,195 --> 00:26:41,959
I can't say that I approve
of your not consulting...

508
00:26:41,998 --> 00:26:43,863
the advertising department
first...

509
00:26:43,900 --> 00:26:47,301
but in the face of this
tremendous public response...

510
00:26:47,337 --> 00:26:49,305
I can't be angry with you.

511
00:26:49,339 --> 00:26:51,671
- What's he talking about?
- Tell you later.

512
00:26:51,708 --> 00:26:53,073
Now, to continue, gentlemen.

513
00:26:53,109 --> 00:26:56,875
I admit this plan sounds
idiotic and impossible.

514
00:26:56,913 --> 00:27:00,576
Imagine Macy's Santa Claus
sending customers to Gimbels.

515
00:27:00,617 --> 00:27:05,213
Ho ho. But, gentlemen,
you cannot argue with success.

516
00:27:05,255 --> 00:27:07,246
Look at this.

517
00:27:07,290 --> 00:27:09,258
Telegrams,
messages, telephone calls.

518
00:27:09,292 --> 00:27:11,283
The governor's wife,
the mayor's wife...

519
00:27:11,327 --> 00:27:13,295
over 500 thankful parents...

520
00:27:13,329 --> 00:27:15,559
expressing
undying gratitude to Macy's.

521
00:27:15,598 --> 00:27:18,032
Never in my entire career...

522
00:27:18,067 --> 00:27:20,433
have I seen such a tremendous
and immediate response...

523
00:27:20,470 --> 00:27:22,199
to a merchandising policy.

524
00:27:22,238 --> 00:27:25,935
And I'm positive, Frank,
if we expand our policy...

525
00:27:25,975 --> 00:27:27,943
we'll expand
our results as well.

526
00:27:27,977 --> 00:27:30,502
Therefore, from now on...

527
00:27:30,546 --> 00:27:32,946
not only will our Santa Claus
continue in this manner...

528
00:27:32,982 --> 00:27:35,712
but I want every salesperson
in this store...

529
00:27:35,752 --> 00:27:37,549
to do precisely the same thing.

530
00:27:37,587 --> 00:27:40,457
If we haven't got exactly
what the customer wants...

531
00:27:40,590 --> 00:27:42,649
we'll send him
where he can get it.

532
00:27:42,692 --> 00:27:44,660
No high pressuring
and forcing a customer...

533
00:27:44,694 --> 00:27:46,321
to take something
he doesn't really want.

534
00:27:46,362 --> 00:27:49,695
We'll be known
as the helpful store...

535
00:27:49,732 --> 00:27:52,394
the friendly store,
the store with a heart...

536
00:27:52,435 --> 00:27:56,098
the store that places
public service ahead of profits.

537
00:27:56,139 --> 00:27:59,108
And, consequently, we'll make
more profits than ever before.

538
00:27:59,142 --> 00:28:01,978
Yes, I know it's late,
and we're all tired...

539
00:28:02,013 --> 00:28:03,377
and we want to go to dinner...

540
00:28:03,413 --> 00:28:05,643
so we'll continue first thing
in the morning.

541
00:28:05,682 --> 00:28:07,912
In the meantime,
you fellas get together...

542
00:28:07,951 --> 00:28:10,112
and figure out the best way
to promote this thing.

543
00:28:10,153 --> 00:28:12,348
We'll do that. Good night, R.H.

544
00:28:12,388 --> 00:28:13,514
Good night.

545
00:28:13,556 --> 00:28:16,753
I want to thank you two again.

546
00:28:16,793 --> 00:28:18,454
And in your
Christmas envelopes...

547
00:28:18,495 --> 00:28:21,157
you'll find a more practical
expression of my gratitude.

548
00:28:21,197 --> 00:28:22,323
Thank you, Mr. Macy.

549
00:28:22,365 --> 00:28:24,356
Tell that Santa
I won't forget him, either.

550
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:26,300
Yes, Mr. Macy.

551
00:28:29,906 --> 00:28:32,602
Imagine, a bonus!

552
00:28:32,642 --> 00:28:35,873
He just assumed it was our idea.
What's the matter?

553
00:28:35,912 --> 00:28:37,903
- I fired him.
- Who?

554
00:28:37,947 --> 00:28:40,177
- Santa Claus.
- What?

555
00:28:40,216 --> 00:28:42,377
He's crazy.
He thinks he is Santa Claus.

556
00:28:42,418 --> 00:28:44,648
I don't care if
he thinks he's the Easter Bunny.

557
00:28:44,687 --> 00:28:45,881
Get him back.

558
00:28:45,922 --> 00:28:47,412
He's insane, I tell you.

559
00:28:47,457 --> 00:28:49,891
We'll hire somebody else
and have him do the same thing.

560
00:28:49,926 --> 00:28:52,451
You heard Mr. Macy.
We've got to keep him.

561
00:28:52,495 --> 00:28:54,656
What if he should have
a sudden fit?

562
00:28:54,697 --> 00:28:56,892
Oh, no.
I've got to tell Mr. Macy.

563
00:28:56,933 --> 00:28:59,401
But maybe
he's only a little crazy...

564
00:28:59,435 --> 00:29:01,403
like painters or composers...

565
00:29:01,437 --> 00:29:03,337
or some of those men
in Washington.

566
00:29:03,373 --> 00:29:05,307
We can't be sure
until he's been examined.

567
00:29:05,341 --> 00:29:08,708
If you fire him, and we find out
he wasn't really crazy...

568
00:29:08,745 --> 00:29:12,112
Mr. Macy will have us
examined and fired.

569
00:29:12,148 --> 00:29:14,446
I suppose
we ought to be sure.

570
00:29:14,484 --> 00:29:16,349
We could if Mr. Sawyer
talked to him.

571
00:29:16,386 --> 00:29:18,115
Of course.
He's a psychologist.

572
00:29:18,154 --> 00:29:20,588
He's paid to examine employees.

573
00:29:20,623 --> 00:29:23,421
Until we get his report,
we won't say a word.

574
00:29:23,459 --> 00:29:25,859
I'll get in touch
with him right away.

575
00:29:25,895 --> 00:29:27,692
First,
get that Santa Claus back!

576
00:29:27,730 --> 00:29:30,096
The examination is worthless
without the patient.

577
00:29:31,434 --> 00:29:34,130
It was just because
I felt we owed it to him...

578
00:29:34,170 --> 00:29:36,730
but Mr. Macy suggested
that we find something else...

579
00:29:36,773 --> 00:29:39,901
for the other Santa Claus
and keep you on by all means.

580
00:29:39,943 --> 00:29:43,003
Oh, well, thanks.
That's mighty good news.

581
00:29:43,046 --> 00:29:45,446
You'll be here
in the morning then?

582
00:29:45,481 --> 00:29:46,607
Certainly I will.

583
00:29:46,649 --> 00:29:49,447
Mrs. Walker, this is
quite an opportunity for me.

584
00:29:49,485 --> 00:29:51,419
For the past 50 years or so...

585
00:29:51,454 --> 00:29:53,649
I've been getting more
worried about Christmas.

586
00:29:53,690 --> 00:29:57,387
Seems we're all so busy trying
to beat the other fellow...

587
00:29:57,427 --> 00:30:00,419
in making things go faster,
look shinier, and cost less...

588
00:30:00,463 --> 00:30:03,660
that Christmas and I are sort of
getting lost in the shuffle.

589
00:30:03,700 --> 00:30:06,498
I don't think so.
Christmas is still Christmas.

590
00:30:06,536 --> 00:30:08,663
Christmas isn't just a day.

591
00:30:08,705 --> 00:30:11,731
It's a frame of mind.
That's what's been changing.

592
00:30:11,774 --> 00:30:14,937
That's why I'm glad I'm here.
Maybe I can do something.

593
00:30:14,978 --> 00:30:16,673
And I'm glad
I met you and your daughter.

594
00:30:16,713 --> 00:30:18,738
You two are a test case for me.

595
00:30:18,781 --> 00:30:20,078
We are?

596
00:30:20,116 --> 00:30:22,676
Yes. You're sort of
the whole thing in miniature.

597
00:30:22,719 --> 00:30:25,688
If I can win you over,
there's still hope.

598
00:30:25,722 --> 00:30:29,488
If not,
then I guess I'm through.

599
00:30:29,525 --> 00:30:32,722
But I'm warning you,
I don't give up easily.

600
00:30:32,762 --> 00:30:34,252
Good night.

601
00:30:34,297 --> 00:30:35,423
Good night.

602
00:30:35,465 --> 00:30:37,797
Oh, Mr. Kringle,
first thing in the morning...

603
00:30:37,834 --> 00:30:40,098
would you report
to Mr. Sawyer's office?

604
00:30:40,136 --> 00:30:42,900
He'll give you
a little examination.

605
00:30:42,939 --> 00:30:45,703
Oh, we do it
with all our employees.

606
00:30:45,742 --> 00:30:47,539
A mental examination?

607
00:30:48,745 --> 00:30:50,770
Well...

608
00:30:50,813 --> 00:30:53,509
I don't mind.
I've taken dozens of them.

609
00:30:53,549 --> 00:30:56,609
Never failed one yet.
Know them by heart.

610
00:30:56,653 --> 00:31:00,350
- How many days in the week?
- Seven.

611
00:31:00,390 --> 00:31:02,950
- How many fingers do you see?
- Four.

612
00:31:02,992 --> 00:31:04,983
Muscular coordination test.

613
00:31:09,399 --> 00:31:11,162
No damage
to the nervous system.

614
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:13,600
Who was the first president
of the United States?

615
00:31:13,636 --> 00:31:14,967
George Washington.

616
00:31:15,004 --> 00:31:18,269
Who was vice president
under John Quincy Adams?

617
00:31:19,275 --> 00:31:21,607
Daniel D. Tompkins.

618
00:31:21,644 --> 00:31:23,976
I'll bet your Mr. Sawyer
doesn't know that.

619
00:31:24,013 --> 00:31:25,173
Good night.

620
00:31:38,294 --> 00:31:40,228
Miss Adams, would you get me...

621
00:31:40,263 --> 00:31:43,494
the Brooks' Memorial Home
in Great Neck?

622
00:31:43,533 --> 00:31:46,161
It's a home for old people.
That's right.

623
00:31:46,202 --> 00:31:48,693
I want to talk
to the doctor in charge.

624
00:31:57,380 --> 00:32:00,008
- How many days in the week?
- Seven.

625
00:32:00,049 --> 00:32:02,574
The first president
of the United States?

626
00:32:02,618 --> 00:32:03,744
George Washington.

627
00:32:03,786 --> 00:32:05,083
Three times five?

628
00:32:05,121 --> 00:32:07,749
You asked me that before.
The answer's at the bottom...

629
00:32:07,790 --> 00:32:09,951
I'm conducting this examination.

630
00:32:09,992 --> 00:32:11,789
How much is three times five?

631
00:32:11,828 --> 00:32:14,695
Same as before... 15.

632
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:20,928
You're rather nervous,
aren't you, Mr. Sawyer?

633
00:32:20,970 --> 00:32:22,631
Do you get enough sleep?

634
00:32:22,672 --> 00:32:24,663
My personal habits
are of no concern to you.

635
00:32:24,707 --> 00:32:27,835
Oh, I'm sorry.
I hate to see someone tied up...

636
00:32:27,877 --> 00:32:30,505
- How many fingers do you see?
- Three.

637
00:32:30,546 --> 00:32:33,037
You bite your nails, too.
Tsk tsk tsk.

638
00:32:33,082 --> 00:32:36,415
I want you to stand
with your feet together...

639
00:32:36,452 --> 00:32:38,477
and your arms extended.
Then I want you to...

640
00:32:38,521 --> 00:32:39,988
Muscular coordination test?

641
00:32:40,022 --> 00:32:43,389
Surely. Be glad to. Ha ha.

642
00:32:45,695 --> 00:32:49,153
Sometimes the cause
of nervous habits like yours...

643
00:32:49,198 --> 00:32:51,496
is not obvious. No.

644
00:32:51,534 --> 00:32:54,401
Often they're the result
of an insecurity.

645
00:32:54,437 --> 00:32:56,064
Are you happy at home?

646
00:32:56,105 --> 00:32:57,538
That will be all!

647
00:32:57,573 --> 00:32:59,768
The examination's over.
You may go.

648
00:32:59,809 --> 00:33:00,935
Thank you.

649
00:33:00,977 --> 00:33:02,308
You may go out that way.

650
00:33:05,481 --> 00:33:07,472
And it may
interest you to know...

651
00:33:07,517 --> 00:33:09,849
that I've been happily
married for 26 years.

652
00:33:09,886 --> 00:33:12,946
Really? Delighted to hear it.

653
00:33:12,989 --> 00:33:14,354
Good-bye.

654
00:33:18,995 --> 00:33:20,121
Get me Mrs. Walker.

655
00:33:20,163 --> 00:33:22,893
Yes, sir. Your wife's on 672.

656
00:33:22,932 --> 00:33:24,729
She says it's very important.

657
00:33:26,569 --> 00:33:30,471
How many times have I told you
not to bother me at the office?

658
00:33:30,506 --> 00:33:33,475
No. Not a penny.
I give you a liberal allowance.

659
00:33:33,509 --> 00:33:35,170
It's up to you
to run the house on it.

660
00:33:35,211 --> 00:33:37,179
If your stupid brother
would get a job...

661
00:33:37,213 --> 00:33:39,374
you wouldn't have to
pester me all the time.

662
00:33:41,918 --> 00:33:45,354
Mrs. Walker, I'd like to talk
to you about this Kringle.

663
00:33:45,388 --> 00:33:48,482
Oh, yes. Dr. Pierce
from the Brooks' home is here.

664
00:33:48,524 --> 00:33:50,389
It would be a good time
to settle the matter.

665
00:33:50,426 --> 00:33:52,485
Sorry, Doctor,
but that was Mr. Sawyer...

666
00:33:52,528 --> 00:33:54,519
the gentleman
I was telling you about.

667
00:33:54,564 --> 00:33:56,725
He's just down the hall.

668
00:33:56,766 --> 00:34:00,258
I can't tell you how
we appreciate your time.

669
00:34:00,303 --> 00:34:03,500
Matter of fact,
I was going to call you today.

670
00:34:03,539 --> 00:34:07,305
I had a feeling about now
you'd be wondering about Kris.

671
00:34:07,343 --> 00:34:10,278
Dr. Pierce, Mr. Sawyer.

672
00:34:10,313 --> 00:34:11,610
How do you do?

673
00:34:11,647 --> 00:34:14,445
After giving this man
a comprehensive examination...

674
00:34:14,483 --> 00:34:16,508
it's my opinion he should
be dismissed immediately.

675
00:34:16,552 --> 00:34:19,919
Really? He failed
to pass the examination?

676
00:34:19,956 --> 00:34:22,447
- Yes.
- He didn't answer correctly?

677
00:34:22,491 --> 00:34:25,460
Yes, he did,
but he lacked concentration.

678
00:34:25,494 --> 00:34:27,962
He kept changing the subject.
Even questioned me.

679
00:34:27,997 --> 00:34:29,965
I don't think
there's any doubt about it.

680
00:34:29,999 --> 00:34:31,967
He should be placed
in a mental institution.

681
00:34:32,001 --> 00:34:34,993
I don't agree.
People are institutionalized...

682
00:34:35,037 --> 00:34:37,174
to prevent them from
harming themselves or others.

683
00:34:37,307 --> 00:34:39,172
Mr. Kringle
is incapable of either.

684
00:34:39,209 --> 00:34:40,676
His is a delusion for good.

685
00:34:40,710 --> 00:34:42,644
He only wants
to be friendly and helpful.

686
00:34:42,679 --> 00:34:44,544
That's what I feel, too.

687
00:34:44,581 --> 00:34:46,674
Thousands of people
have similar delusions...

688
00:34:46,716 --> 00:34:48,650
living perfectly normal lives
in every other respect.

689
00:34:48,685 --> 00:34:51,552
A famous example
is that fellow...

690
00:34:51,588 --> 00:34:54,056
I can't think of his name.

691
00:34:54,090 --> 00:34:56,490
For years, he's insisted
he's a Russian prince.

692
00:34:56,526 --> 00:34:58,551
There's been much evidence
to prove him wrong...

693
00:34:58,595 --> 00:35:00,495
but nothing
has shaken his story.

694
00:35:00,530 --> 00:35:01,997
Is he in an institution?

695
00:35:02,032 --> 00:35:04,330
No. He owns a famous restaurant
in Hollywood...

696
00:35:04,367 --> 00:35:05,629
and is a highly
respected citizen.

697
00:35:05,669 --> 00:35:08,934
I've made a great study
of abnormal psychology...

698
00:35:08,972 --> 00:35:12,305
and I've found from experience
when a delusion is challenged...

699
00:35:12,342 --> 00:35:13,934
the deluded
is apt to become violent.

700
00:35:13,977 --> 00:35:15,945
I'll have to disagree
with you again.

701
00:35:15,979 --> 00:35:18,777
If you tell Kris
there is no Santa Claus...

702
00:35:18,815 --> 00:35:21,249
I grant he'll argue the point,
but he'll not become violent.

703
00:35:21,284 --> 00:35:23,479
His whole manner
suggests aggressiveness!

704
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:26,387
Look how he carries that cane!
He's never without it.

705
00:35:26,423 --> 00:35:28,823
I know Kris
always carries a cane...

706
00:35:28,858 --> 00:35:31,326
but surely you're not implying
he'd use the cane as a weapon?

707
00:35:31,361 --> 00:35:35,457
Mrs. Walker, naturally
I can't discharge this man.

708
00:35:35,498 --> 00:35:39,025
That's up to you.
But you asked my opinion.

709
00:35:39,069 --> 00:35:40,969
So when he exhibits his latent
maniacal tendencies...

710
00:35:41,004 --> 00:35:42,938
which I assure you he will...

711
00:35:42,973 --> 00:35:45,601
please realize
the responsibility is yours.

712
00:35:51,081 --> 00:35:53,311
Speaking of delusions...

713
00:35:53,350 --> 00:35:55,682
Now we're right back
where we started.

714
00:35:55,719 --> 00:35:57,186
No, we're not.

715
00:35:57,220 --> 00:35:59,654
After listening to Dr. Pierce,
I feel perfectly confident.

716
00:35:59,689 --> 00:36:02,715
But if anything happens,
you won't get blamed. I will.

717
00:36:02,759 --> 00:36:05,353
Nothing's going to happen.

718
00:36:05,395 --> 00:36:07,989
Please don't feel what I've said
was prompted by affection.

719
00:36:08,031 --> 00:36:09,999
My specialty is geriatrics.

720
00:36:10,033 --> 00:36:11,330
Huh?

721
00:36:11,368 --> 00:36:12,926
Treatment
of the diseases of old age.

722
00:36:12,969 --> 00:36:14,994
I've had quite a bit
of experience...

723
00:36:15,038 --> 00:36:19,202
and I assure you Kris has
no latent maniacal tendencies.

724
00:36:19,242 --> 00:36:20,937
You'll want to discuss this
with Mr. Shellhammer...

725
00:36:20,977 --> 00:36:23,537
so I'll be on my way.
May I see Kris?

726
00:36:23,580 --> 00:36:25,047
Why, certainly, Doctor.

727
00:36:25,081 --> 00:36:26,946
Use the employees' elevator.
It's much quicker.

728
00:36:26,983 --> 00:36:28,450
The same one you came up on.

729
00:36:28,485 --> 00:36:30,851
- Where is that?
- I'll show you.

730
00:36:30,887 --> 00:36:32,684
That isn't necessary.
I'll find my way.

731
00:36:32,722 --> 00:36:35,213
You understand
my position, Doctor.

732
00:36:35,258 --> 00:36:36,782
If there's the slightest
possibility...

733
00:36:36,826 --> 00:36:39,351
of him becoming violent
or getting into trouble...

734
00:36:39,396 --> 00:36:41,330
What trouble could he get into?

735
00:36:41,364 --> 00:36:44,094
All that's got to happen
is a policeman to ask his name.

736
00:36:44,134 --> 00:36:46,967
A big argument.
Clang, clang! Bellevue!

737
00:36:47,003 --> 00:36:48,971
You can prevent that
very simply.

738
00:36:49,005 --> 00:36:51,064
If he could
stay with an employee...

739
00:36:51,107 --> 00:36:53,302
they could ride
to and from work together.

740
00:36:53,343 --> 00:36:56,471
I'd prefer he didn't take the
train to Great Neck twice a day.

741
00:36:56,513 --> 00:36:57,980
That would solve everything.

742
00:36:58,014 --> 00:37:00,073
They could steer him away
from trouble.

743
00:37:00,116 --> 00:37:01,583
Sort of take custody of him.

744
00:37:01,618 --> 00:37:03,245
Do you think
he'd agree to that?

745
00:37:03,286 --> 00:37:04,913
I'll talk to him.
I'm sure he will.

746
00:37:04,954 --> 00:37:06,421
In that case, he can stay.

747
00:37:06,456 --> 00:37:08,048
Good. Thank you.

748
00:37:08,091 --> 00:37:10,924
It's the seventh floor,
and thank you very much.

749
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:12,154
- Bye, Doctor.
- Bye.

750
00:37:13,697 --> 00:37:16,257
I'm sure
you made a wise decision.

751
00:37:16,299 --> 00:37:19,097
Now, let's see...
who could rent him a room?

752
00:37:19,135 --> 00:37:20,261
You.

753
00:37:20,303 --> 00:37:22,931
Your son's away at school.
What about his room?

754
00:37:22,972 --> 00:37:25,964
Well, I don't mind.
I'd be glad to.

755
00:37:26,009 --> 00:37:28,443
I'm positive Mrs. Shellhammer
wouldn't like it.

756
00:37:28,478 --> 00:37:30,070
She's a little...

757
00:37:30,113 --> 00:37:32,081
Say, I have an idea.

758
00:37:32,115 --> 00:37:34,049
We always have martinis
before dinner.

759
00:37:34,084 --> 00:37:36,712
I'll make them
double-strength tonight.

760
00:37:36,753 --> 00:37:39,722
I'll bet after a couple of them,
she'll be more receptive.

761
00:37:39,756 --> 00:37:41,451
But Kris is through work
at 6:00.

762
00:37:41,491 --> 00:37:43,220
What about
the in-between time?

763
00:37:43,259 --> 00:37:44,954
Take him home to dinner.

764
00:37:44,994 --> 00:37:48,054
I'll call soon as my wife's
plastered... feeling gay.

765
00:37:48,098 --> 00:37:49,463
Oh, no.

766
00:37:49,499 --> 00:37:51,057
If I'm willing
to let my wife...

767
00:37:51,101 --> 00:37:53,001
have a big headache
in the morning...

768
00:37:53,036 --> 00:37:54,901
you can have
a little headache tonight.

769
00:37:54,938 --> 00:37:56,633
All right.

770
00:37:56,673 --> 00:37:59,005
Won't take an hour.
Everything will be OK.

771
00:38:00,009 --> 00:38:02,569
Good. Very good.

772
00:38:02,612 --> 00:38:06,207
What sort of games do you play
with the other children?

773
00:38:06,249 --> 00:38:09,946
I don't play much with them.
They play silly games.

774
00:38:09,986 --> 00:38:11,214
They do?

775
00:38:11,254 --> 00:38:13,916
Like today. They were
in the basement playing zoo...

776
00:38:13,957 --> 00:38:16,084
and all of them were animals.

777
00:38:16,126 --> 00:38:19,425
When I came down, Homer...
he was the zookeeper...

778
00:38:19,462 --> 00:38:22,590
he said, "What animal are you?"

779
00:38:22,632 --> 00:38:25,829
I said,
"I'm not an animal, I'm a girl."

780
00:38:25,869 --> 00:38:27,928
And he said,
"Only animals allowed."

781
00:38:27,971 --> 00:38:29,836
So I came upstairs.

782
00:38:29,873 --> 00:38:32,137
Why didn't you tell him
you were a lion or a bear?

783
00:38:32,175 --> 00:38:34,075
Because
I'm not a bear or a lion.

784
00:38:34,110 --> 00:38:37,079
But the other children
were only children...

785
00:38:37,113 --> 00:38:39,081
and they were pretending
to be animals.

786
00:38:39,115 --> 00:38:41,447
That's what makes
the game so silly.

787
00:38:41,484 --> 00:38:42,644
I don't think so.

788
00:38:42,685 --> 00:38:45,119
Sounds like
a wonderful game to me.

789
00:38:45,155 --> 00:38:50,650
Of course, in order to play it,
you need an imagination.

790
00:38:50,693 --> 00:38:53,184
Do you know
what the imagination is?

791
00:38:53,229 --> 00:38:54,491
Oh, sure.

792
00:38:54,531 --> 00:38:57,193
That's when you see things,
but they're not really there.

793
00:38:57,233 --> 00:39:00,828
That can be caused
by other things, too.

794
00:39:00,870 --> 00:39:04,431
No, to me the imagination
is a place all by itself...

795
00:39:04,474 --> 00:39:06,442
a separate country.

796
00:39:06,476 --> 00:39:09,604
You've heard of the French
or the British nation.

797
00:39:09,646 --> 00:39:11,614
Well, this is
the Imagine nation.

798
00:39:11,648 --> 00:39:13,707
It's a wonderful place.

799
00:39:13,750 --> 00:39:20,053
How would you like to make
snowballs in the summertime?

800
00:39:20,089 --> 00:39:24,219
Or drive a big bus
right down 5th Avenue?

801
00:39:24,260 --> 00:39:26,820
How would you like to have
a ship all to yourself...

802
00:39:26,863 --> 00:39:30,822
that makes daily trips
to China and Australia?

803
00:39:30,867 --> 00:39:33,427
How would you like to be
the Statue of Liberty...

804
00:39:33,470 --> 00:39:35,802
in the morning,
and in the afternoon...

805
00:39:35,839 --> 00:39:37,670
fly south with a flock of geese?

806
00:39:40,043 --> 00:39:43,444
It's very simple.
Of course, it takes practice.

807
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:47,940
The first thing you've got
to learn is how to pretend.

808
00:39:47,984 --> 00:39:51,943
And the next time Homer says,
"What kind of animal are you?"

809
00:39:51,988 --> 00:39:53,956
Tell him you're a monkey.

810
00:39:53,990 --> 00:39:55,958
I don't know how to be a monkey.

811
00:39:55,992 --> 00:39:58,460
Sure you do.
Here, I'll show you.

812
00:39:58,495 --> 00:40:00,463
Now just bend
your body over a little.

813
00:40:00,497 --> 00:40:02,465
Let your arms hang loose, see?

814
00:40:02,499 --> 00:40:05,059
Now put your right hand
up here... under here.

815
00:40:05,101 --> 00:40:08,559
Now scratch yourself, see?
That's right.

816
00:40:08,605 --> 00:40:11,574
Put your tongue under your lips,
over your teeth.

817
00:40:11,608 --> 00:40:14,577
- Like this?
- That's right.

818
00:40:14,611 --> 00:40:16,476
Now scratch yourself
and chatter, see?

819
00:40:16,513 --> 00:40:19,710
- Bla bla bla!
- Eeek!

820
00:40:19,749 --> 00:40:21,114
Eeek erp!

821
00:40:21,150 --> 00:40:24,483
Haislip, Haislip, Sherman,
Mackenzie, and Haislip...

822
00:40:24,521 --> 00:40:25,988
have been very kind to me.

823
00:40:26,022 --> 00:40:29,583
But being an exceptional lawyer,
I want to open my own office.

824
00:40:29,626 --> 00:40:32,117
Put this in
Susan's place for me, please.

825
00:40:32,161 --> 00:40:34,425
Take the meat out.
It should be done.

826
00:40:36,666 --> 00:40:38,497
Don't forget to scratch.

827
00:40:38,535 --> 00:40:41,003
Put your tongue up
in front of your teeth.

828
00:40:41,037 --> 00:40:43,471
Talk to the other monkeys.

829
00:40:43,506 --> 00:40:45,804
What's going on here?

830
00:40:45,842 --> 00:40:47,969
We're having
our first lesson in pretending.

831
00:40:48,011 --> 00:40:50,002
Doing quite well at it, too.

832
00:40:50,046 --> 00:40:53,015
That's right.
Call the other monkeys.

833
00:40:53,049 --> 00:40:57,509
No. You mustn't be a goose.
Be a monkey.

834
00:40:57,554 --> 00:41:00,318
- Mr. Kringle...
- Yes?

835
00:41:00,356 --> 00:41:02,381
Mrs. Walker
just happened to mention...

836
00:41:02,425 --> 00:41:04,620
that they're looking
for a room for you.

837
00:41:04,661 --> 00:41:05,958
That's right.

838
00:41:05,995 --> 00:41:08,589
Dr. Pierce doesn't want me
making the long trip daily.

839
00:41:08,631 --> 00:41:10,462
I was just thinking.

840
00:41:10,500 --> 00:41:13,492
I'm all alone in my apartment.

841
00:41:13,536 --> 00:41:15,970
Twin beds, plenty of room.

842
00:41:16,005 --> 00:41:18,974
If you'd like
to move in with me...

843
00:41:19,008 --> 00:41:20,976
I'd be only too happy
to have you.

844
00:41:21,010 --> 00:41:22,637
That's awfully nice of you.

845
00:41:22,679 --> 00:41:25,580
You could ride to and from
work with Mrs. Walker.

846
00:41:25,615 --> 00:41:28,812
Yes. That would
give me a chance...

847
00:41:28,851 --> 00:41:31,388
to really talk things
over with her.

848
00:41:33,857 --> 00:41:37,884
Don't forget to scratch.
You're not scratching.

849
00:41:37,927 --> 00:41:40,657
Besides, I could see
Suzie now and then.

850
00:41:40,697 --> 00:41:42,494
Mr. Gailey, it's a deal.

851
00:41:42,532 --> 00:41:43,965
Good!

852
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:47,299
We'll get your things
after dinner.

853
00:41:47,337 --> 00:41:49,567
Hello.
Oh, yes, just a moment.

854
00:41:49,606 --> 00:41:51,096
It's a Mr. Shellhammer.

855
00:41:51,141 --> 00:41:52,301
Thanks.

856
00:41:53,376 --> 00:41:55,139
Hello, Mr. Shellhammer.

857
00:41:55,178 --> 00:41:57,305
Yes. Just a moment.

858
00:41:57,347 --> 00:41:59,542
Mrs. Shellhammer
wants to talk to you.

859
00:42:00,850 --> 00:42:03,444
I made the martinis
triple-strength...

860
00:42:03,486 --> 00:42:05,477
and she feels wonderful.

861
00:42:06,790 --> 00:42:08,451
Here, my pet.

862
00:42:08,491 --> 00:42:10,254
Ha ha.

863
00:42:10,293 --> 00:42:11,783
Hello?

864
00:42:13,296 --> 00:42:14,763
Hello?

865
00:42:14,798 --> 00:42:16,766
No, no. No, dear.

866
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:19,098
Thank you, darling.

867
00:42:20,937 --> 00:42:22,802
Hello?

868
00:42:22,839 --> 00:42:25,637
No, no, dear. There.

869
00:42:25,675 --> 00:42:28,838
Oh, darling, how silly of me!

870
00:42:30,513 --> 00:42:32,140
Hello!

871
00:42:33,917 --> 00:42:38,445
We'd love to have Santa Claus
come and stay with us.

872
00:42:40,356 --> 00:42:43,553
I think it would be
simply charming.

873
00:42:43,593 --> 00:42:45,993
Oh, and so do I,
Mrs. Shellhammer.

874
00:42:46,029 --> 00:42:47,997
Just a moment.

875
00:42:48,031 --> 00:42:51,000
It's Mrs. Shellhammer.
They have the loveliest room.

876
00:42:51,034 --> 00:42:53,093
They'd be so happy
if you'd stay with them.

877
00:42:53,136 --> 00:42:55,104
That's very sweet of them.

878
00:42:55,138 --> 00:42:56,469
Please thank them very much...

879
00:42:56,506 --> 00:42:59,964
but I'm going to stay
with Mr. Gailey.

880
00:43:00,009 --> 00:43:01,135
Mr. Gailey.

881
00:43:01,177 --> 00:43:03,873
I think
I'd better get the meat.

882
00:43:06,649 --> 00:43:08,276
Yes, I understand that...

883
00:43:08,318 --> 00:43:10,445
but there must be something
you want for Christmas...

884
00:43:10,487 --> 00:43:12,955
something you haven't
even told your mother.

885
00:43:12,989 --> 00:43:15,253
Oh, come on, now.

886
00:43:15,291 --> 00:43:17,316
Why don't you give me a chance?

887
00:43:18,862 --> 00:43:20,853
Well...

888
00:43:37,614 --> 00:43:39,844
That's what
I want for Christmas.

889
00:43:39,883 --> 00:43:41,510
A doll's house like this?

890
00:43:41,551 --> 00:43:44,145
No, a real house.

891
00:43:44,187 --> 00:43:46,348
If you're really Santa Claus,
you can get it for me.

892
00:43:46,389 --> 00:43:47,617
And if you can't...

893
00:43:47,657 --> 00:43:50,353
you're only a nice man with
a white beard, like mother said.

894
00:43:50,393 --> 00:43:51,985
Now wait a minute, Suzie.

895
00:43:52,028 --> 00:43:54,326
Just because every child
can't get his wish...

896
00:43:54,364 --> 00:43:55,831
doesn't mean
there isn't a Santa Claus.

897
00:43:55,865 --> 00:43:58,197
That's what I thought you'd say.

898
00:43:58,234 --> 00:43:59,997
But don't you see, dear?

899
00:44:00,036 --> 00:44:02,937
Some children wish for things
they couldn't possibly use...

900
00:44:02,972 --> 00:44:05,668
like real locomotives
or B-29s.

901
00:44:05,708 --> 00:44:09,269
But this isn't like
a locomotive or a B-29.

902
00:44:09,312 --> 00:44:11,872
It's awful big
for a little girl like you.

903
00:44:11,915 --> 00:44:14,611
What could you do
with a house like this?

904
00:44:14,651 --> 00:44:16,482
Live in it with my mother.

905
00:44:16,519 --> 00:44:18,783
But you've got
this lovely apartment.

906
00:44:18,821 --> 00:44:20,448
I don't think it's lovely.

907
00:44:20,490 --> 00:44:24,893
I want a backyard with a great
big tree to put a swing on...

908
00:44:28,498 --> 00:44:30,363
I guess you can't get it, huh?

909
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:32,834
I didn't say that.

910
00:44:32,869 --> 00:44:34,359
Well...

911
00:44:39,008 --> 00:44:41,977
Well, it's a tall order...

912
00:44:42,011 --> 00:44:43,979
but I'll do my best.

913
00:44:44,013 --> 00:44:45,640
May I keep this picture?

914
00:44:45,682 --> 00:44:47,377
Mm-hmm.

915
00:44:47,417 --> 00:44:50,875
Thank you. Good night, Susan.

916
00:44:50,920 --> 00:44:52,911
Good night, Mr. Kringle.

917
00:45:40,503 --> 00:45:42,471
Nice place you've got here.

918
00:45:42,505 --> 00:45:44,473
Was I lucky to get it!

919
00:45:44,507 --> 00:45:47,908
You like living
in Manhattan?

920
00:45:47,944 --> 00:45:49,912
It's all right.

921
00:45:49,946 --> 00:45:52,278
Someday I'd like to get
a place on Long Island.

922
00:45:52,315 --> 00:45:53,646
Not a big house.

923
00:45:53,683 --> 00:45:56,914
One of those junior-partner
deals around Manhasset.

924
00:45:56,953 --> 00:46:00,480
I know just
the kind of place you mean.

925
00:46:00,523 --> 00:46:03,856
One of those
little Colonial houses.

926
00:46:03,893 --> 00:46:06,361
Either that or Cape Cod.

927
00:46:06,396 --> 00:46:08,864
You're right about Mrs. Walker.

928
00:46:08,898 --> 00:46:10,889
A little more effort
on your part...

929
00:46:10,933 --> 00:46:13,902
and she might crawl out
of that shell.

930
00:46:13,936 --> 00:46:15,927
Take her to dinner, the theater.

931
00:46:15,972 --> 00:46:17,599
I've tried that.

932
00:46:17,640 --> 00:46:19,904
She's always too busy
with her job.

933
00:46:19,942 --> 00:46:22,570
Try a little harder.
Those two are lost souls.

934
00:46:22,612 --> 00:46:24,443
It's up to us to help them.

935
00:46:24,480 --> 00:46:27,449
I'll take care of Suzie
if you take care of her mother.

936
00:46:27,483 --> 00:46:29,451
- It's a deal.
- Ready?

937
00:46:29,485 --> 00:46:31,953
Oh, no, you don't.
I'm not gonna be cheated.

938
00:46:31,988 --> 00:46:34,081
All my life
I've wondered something.

939
00:46:34,123 --> 00:46:36,091
Now's my chance to find out.

940
00:46:36,125 --> 00:46:38,593
It's a question that's puzzled
the worid for centuries.

941
00:46:38,628 --> 00:46:43,429
Does Santa Claus sleep
with his whiskers outside or in?

942
00:46:43,466 --> 00:46:45,434
Always sleep with them out.

943
00:46:45,468 --> 00:46:47,459
Cold air makes them grow.

944
00:46:53,843 --> 00:46:55,470
Joe, we're running
out of books.

945
00:46:55,511 --> 00:46:57,103
I'll get some right away.

946
00:46:57,146 --> 00:46:58,977
I need some more Wanamakers.

947
00:47:22,972 --> 00:47:25,440
Yes, I know just what you want.

948
00:47:25,475 --> 00:47:28,444
We don't carry that brand,
but I think Gimbels does.

949
00:47:28,478 --> 00:47:31,936
Let me see. Yes, here it is.

950
00:47:31,981 --> 00:47:34,575
I thought I noticed it before.
2.98.

951
00:47:34,617 --> 00:47:36,448
Looks like
an exceptional bargain.

952
00:47:36,486 --> 00:47:38,454
Yes, it does. Thank you.

953
00:47:38,488 --> 00:47:40,319
Not at all.

954
00:47:48,865 --> 00:47:50,958
Why didn't one of you
think of this idea?

955
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:54,401
It's the greatest
goodwill policy I ever heard of.

956
00:47:54,437 --> 00:47:56,371
Every shopper
in New York City...

957
00:47:56,405 --> 00:47:59,499
suddenly thinks of Macy
as a benevolent soul...

958
00:47:59,542 --> 00:48:02,534
thinking only of the welfare
of the public.

959
00:48:02,578 --> 00:48:04,409
And what does that make Gimbel?

960
00:48:04,447 --> 00:48:06,415
Nothing but a profiteering
moneygrubber.

961
00:48:06,449 --> 00:48:08,417
Two can play at this game.

962
00:48:08,451 --> 00:48:11,420
From now on, if we haven't got
what the customer wants...

963
00:48:11,454 --> 00:48:12,921
send him back to Macy's.

964
00:48:12,955 --> 00:48:15,389
And what's more, we'll do
the same thing in our stores...

965
00:48:15,424 --> 00:48:18,052
in Philadelphia,
Milwaukee, and Pittsburgh.

966
00:48:18,094 --> 00:48:20,062
Get to work on it right away.

967
00:48:22,031 --> 00:48:24,693
So, Gimbel's doing it
in Philadelphia...

968
00:48:24,734 --> 00:48:26,429
Pittsburgh, and Milwaukee, eh?

969
00:48:26,469 --> 00:48:27,936
And very successfully.

970
00:48:27,970 --> 00:48:30,029
Well, we can cover
the country, too.

971
00:48:30,072 --> 00:48:32,063
Notify our stores
in San Francisco...

972
00:48:32,108 --> 00:48:35,566
Atlanta, Toledo, and Newark
to get going right away.

973
00:48:35,611 --> 00:48:37,078
All right, Mr. Macy.

974
00:48:38,247 --> 00:48:41,375
- Look this way, Mr. Gimbel.
- Hold it, Mr. Gimbel.

975
00:48:41,417 --> 00:48:43,146
One more.

976
00:48:43,186 --> 00:48:44,983
That's fine.

977
00:48:45,021 --> 00:48:47,421
Now we'll take some
at my store.

978
00:48:47,456 --> 00:48:48,889
Just a minute.

979
00:48:48,925 --> 00:48:52,383
I have something I'd like
to give our friend here.

980
00:48:52,428 --> 00:48:56,364
This is a little something
to show my appreciation...

981
00:48:56,399 --> 00:48:57,525
for all you've done.

982
00:48:57,567 --> 00:48:59,797
Thank you, Mr. Macy.

983
00:48:59,836 --> 00:49:02,737
Ooh! That's very kind of you.

984
00:49:02,772 --> 00:49:05,900
I didn't think
you were that generous.

985
00:49:05,942 --> 00:49:07,910
That's a bit of money.

986
00:49:07,944 --> 00:49:09,912
What are you going
to do with it?

987
00:49:09,946 --> 00:49:13,575
Well, I have a friend.

988
00:49:13,616 --> 00:49:16,414
A doctor.
He's been very kind to me.

989
00:49:16,452 --> 00:49:18,420
He needs an x-ray machine.

990
00:49:18,454 --> 00:49:20,855
I don't think
that's going to be enough.

991
00:49:20,988 --> 00:49:23,616
I'll make up the difference.

992
00:49:23,657 --> 00:49:25,625
Buy it through the store.
Get 10% discount.

993
00:49:25,659 --> 00:49:28,059
I can get it for cost.

994
00:49:34,335 --> 00:49:36,030
Good night, Susan.

995
00:49:36,070 --> 00:49:37,799
Good night, Cleo.

996
00:49:37,838 --> 00:49:41,296
Like me to sing you
a good night song?

997
00:49:41,342 --> 00:49:43,310
If you want to.

998
00:49:43,344 --> 00:49:46,313
Doesn't your mother
ever sing to you at night?

999
00:49:46,347 --> 00:49:49,077
Uh-uh. Why should she?

1000
00:49:49,116 --> 00:49:53,951
Oh, no reason.
I just think it's kind of nice.

1001
00:49:53,988 --> 00:49:57,287
- Do you like "Market"?
- All right.

1002
00:49:57,324 --> 00:50:01,351
To market, to market
to buy a fat pig

1003
00:50:01,395 --> 00:50:04,626
Home again, home again,
jiggidy jig

1004
00:50:04,665 --> 00:50:08,066
To market, to market
to buy a fat hog

1005
00:50:08,102 --> 00:50:11,970
Home again, home again,
jiggidy...

1006
00:50:16,644 --> 00:50:19,044
Amazing.

1007
00:50:19,079 --> 00:50:21,240
Do you happen
to have a spare piece?

1008
00:50:21,282 --> 00:50:22,579
Mm-hmm.

1009
00:50:32,593 --> 00:50:34,424
Well, here goes.

1010
00:50:45,673 --> 00:50:48,301
Oh!

1011
00:51:03,924 --> 00:51:05,755
- Hello, Alfred.
- Hello, Kris.

1012
00:51:05,793 --> 00:51:08,591
How about a game
of checkers after lunch?

1013
00:51:08,629 --> 00:51:11,757
Leave us not today.
I don't feel like it.

1014
00:51:11,799 --> 00:51:13,596
Oh? What's the matter?

1015
00:51:13,634 --> 00:51:15,363
Nothing. Nothing.

1016
00:51:15,403 --> 00:51:18,065
Something is wrong.
What is it?

1017
00:51:19,640 --> 00:51:22,473
Well,
remember I was telling you...

1018
00:51:22,510 --> 00:51:25,809
how I like to play Santa
at the "Y" on Christmas...

1019
00:51:25,846 --> 00:51:28,144
and give out packages
to the young kids?

1020
00:51:28,182 --> 00:51:30,650
I was telling that
to Mr. Sawyer, see...

1021
00:51:30,685 --> 00:51:33,552
and he says that's very bad.

1022
00:51:33,587 --> 00:51:35,282
Sawyer. You mean, uh...

1023
00:51:35,323 --> 00:51:38,292
That's the one.
He's a psychologist.

1024
00:51:38,326 --> 00:51:41,295
Ohh,
that's a debatable poin...

1025
00:51:41,329 --> 00:51:43,194
Why is it bad, does he say?

1026
00:51:43,230 --> 00:51:47,792
He says guys who dress
like Santa Claus, see...

1027
00:51:47,835 --> 00:51:49,302
and give presents away...

1028
00:51:49,337 --> 00:51:51,305
do it because
when they was young...

1029
00:51:51,339 --> 00:51:52,806
they must have
did something bad...

1030
00:51:52,840 --> 00:51:54,239
and they feel guilty about it.

1031
00:51:54,275 --> 00:51:56,402
So now they do something
they think is good...

1032
00:51:56,444 --> 00:51:57,741
to make up for it.

1033
00:51:57,778 --> 00:52:00,542
It's what he calls
a guilt complex.

1034
00:52:02,783 --> 00:52:04,546
How old are you, Alfred?

1035
00:52:04,585 --> 00:52:06,052
Seventeen.

1036
00:52:06,087 --> 00:52:08,248
Seventeen.

1037
00:52:08,289 --> 00:52:10,917
Doesn't seem you've had time
to be guilty of anything...

1038
00:52:10,958 --> 00:52:12,482
except overeating.

1039
00:52:12,526 --> 00:52:14,756
It's nothing to laugh about.

1040
00:52:14,795 --> 00:52:16,888
It's pretty serious, he says.

1041
00:52:16,931 --> 00:52:19,229
It's a lot of rubbish, Alfred.
Don't listen.

1042
00:52:19,266 --> 00:52:21,257
Oh, he knows
what he's talking about.

1043
00:52:21,302 --> 00:52:24,100
He's been studying that stuff
for a long time.

1044
00:52:24,138 --> 00:52:27,767
Well, what's the basis
of this guilt complex...

1045
00:52:27,808 --> 00:52:29,435
you're supposed to have?

1046
00:52:29,477 --> 00:52:31,001
Does he say that?

1047
00:52:31,045 --> 00:52:34,276
Well, he ain't found out yet.

1048
00:52:34,315 --> 00:52:37,773
It's probably way down
inside of me someplace, see?

1049
00:52:37,818 --> 00:52:41,015
Maybe something that happened
when I was a baby, he says.

1050
00:52:41,055 --> 00:52:44,149
It takes time,
but he'll do it, he says.

1051
00:52:44,191 --> 00:52:47,024
You mean
you're going to him again?

1052
00:52:47,061 --> 00:52:50,121
Sure.
I go every day after lunch.

1053
00:52:50,164 --> 00:52:52,530
Oh, he don't soak me nothin'.

1054
00:52:52,566 --> 00:52:56,229
He's doing it for free
'cause I'm an interesting case.

1055
00:52:56,270 --> 00:52:57,464
Yes.

1056
00:52:57,505 --> 00:53:00,372
What else has he found
wrong with you, Alfred?

1057
00:53:01,442 --> 00:53:03,342
Anything else?

1058
00:53:03,377 --> 00:53:06,437
No. Oh, just
that I hate my father.

1059
00:53:06,480 --> 00:53:09,449
I didn't know it,
but he says I do.

1060
00:53:09,483 --> 00:53:11,849
And he sees you every day?

1061
00:53:11,886 --> 00:53:15,344
Yeah. I say anything
that comes into my head.

1062
00:53:15,389 --> 00:53:17,254
Excuse me, Alfred.

1063
00:53:17,291 --> 00:53:18,952
A few things
have just come into my head...

1064
00:53:18,993 --> 00:53:20,517
and I'm going to say them.

1065
00:53:32,072 --> 00:53:33,869
Why are you busting in here?

1066
00:53:33,908 --> 00:53:35,967
Are you a licensed psychiatrist?

1067
00:53:36,010 --> 00:53:38,205
What business is it of yours?

1068
00:53:38,245 --> 00:53:40,270
I have great respect
for psychiatry...

1069
00:53:40,314 --> 00:53:43,306
and great contempt for amateurs
who go around practicing it.

1070
00:53:43,350 --> 00:53:45,284
You have no more right
to analyze Alfred...

1071
00:53:45,319 --> 00:53:47,617
than a dentist has
to remove a gallbladder!

1072
00:53:47,655 --> 00:53:48,952
I beg your pardon.

1073
00:53:48,989 --> 00:53:52,254
Your job here, I gather,
is to give intelligence tests.

1074
00:53:52,293 --> 00:53:54,158
Passing yourself off
as a psychologist.

1075
00:53:54,195 --> 00:53:56,425
You ought to be horsewhipped...

1076
00:53:56,464 --> 00:53:58,728
taking a normal, impressionable
boy like Alfred...

1077
00:53:58,766 --> 00:54:00,529
and filling him with complexes.

1078
00:54:00,568 --> 00:54:02,900
I'm better equipped
to judge that than you are.

1079
00:54:02,937 --> 00:54:05,235
Just because the boy
wants to be kind to children...

1080
00:54:05,272 --> 00:54:07,240
you tell him
he has a guilt complex.

1081
00:54:07,274 --> 00:54:09,003
Sharing his delusion,
you couldn't understand.

1082
00:54:09,043 --> 00:54:11,409
Alfred's definitely maladjusted,
and I'm helping.

1083
00:54:11,445 --> 00:54:12,912
Maladjusted?!
You talk about maladjusted.

1084
00:54:12,947 --> 00:54:15,245
It seems to me the patient
is running the clinic here.

1085
00:54:15,282 --> 00:54:17,750
I won't stand...
Leave this office immediately.

1086
00:54:17,785 --> 00:54:19,946
Now either
you stop analyzing Alfred...

1087
00:54:19,987 --> 00:54:21,454
or I go straight to Mr. Macy...

1088
00:54:21,489 --> 00:54:23,753
and tell him what a contemptible
fraud you are.

1089
00:54:23,791 --> 00:54:25,452
Leave or I'll call security.

1090
00:54:25,493 --> 00:54:29,395
There's only one way
to handle a man like you.

1091
00:54:29,430 --> 00:54:31,830
You won't listen to reason.
You're heartless.

1092
00:54:31,866 --> 00:54:32,992
You have no humanity.

1093
00:54:33,033 --> 00:54:35,228
Are you going to leave?

1094
00:54:35,269 --> 00:54:36,463
Yes.

1095
00:54:45,646 --> 00:54:46,943
- Kris.
- Mr. Sawyer!

1096
00:54:46,981 --> 00:54:49,449
Mr. Sawyer,
are you all right?

1097
00:54:49,483 --> 00:54:50,677
Look at that bump!

1098
00:54:50,718 --> 00:54:51,946
Mr. Sawyer...
He's unconscious!

1099
00:54:51,986 --> 00:54:53,886
Better get a wet towel.

1100
00:54:53,921 --> 00:54:55,388
No, better get a doctor.

1101
00:54:55,422 --> 00:54:57,890
You must have done
something to him.

1102
00:54:57,925 --> 00:54:59,893
I tell you
we were merely talking...

1103
00:54:59,927 --> 00:55:03,124
but when I mentioned Santa Claus
and attacked his delusion...

1104
00:55:03,163 --> 00:55:04,391
he became violent.

1105
00:55:04,431 --> 00:55:06,899
I told you he had
latent maniacal tendencies.

1106
00:55:06,934 --> 00:55:08,902
Well, I think this proves it.

1107
00:55:08,936 --> 00:55:11,404
Have Dr. Pierce
give him another examination.

1108
00:55:11,438 --> 00:55:12,564
Dr. Pierce...

1109
00:55:12,606 --> 00:55:14,904
He doesn't know anything
about this sort of thing.

1110
00:55:14,942 --> 00:55:16,409
He's a general practitioner.

1111
00:55:16,443 --> 00:55:18,411
You must admit
this is rather serious.

1112
00:55:18,445 --> 00:55:19,912
Perhaps we'd better get
a competent psychiatrist.

1113
00:55:19,947 --> 00:55:22,415
But he's taken dozens
of those examinations...

1114
00:55:22,449 --> 00:55:23,916
and passed them all 100%.

1115
00:55:23,951 --> 00:55:26,647
It's possible
his condition has changed.

1116
00:55:26,687 --> 00:55:28,917
I don't think
we can take any chances.

1117
00:55:28,956 --> 00:55:30,924
I can't see any harm in it.

1118
00:55:30,958 --> 00:55:33,483
If he passes the test,
he can return to work at once...

1119
00:55:33,527 --> 00:55:35,927
and if he doesn't,
it's better if we find out.

1120
00:55:35,963 --> 00:55:38,431
You better have
the examination right away...

1121
00:55:38,465 --> 00:55:41,434
before he tells Mr. Ma...
before Mr. Macy finds out.

1122
00:55:41,468 --> 00:55:42,594
Oh, my, yes.

1123
00:55:42,636 --> 00:55:45,434
You explain to Mr. Kringle.
After all, you're his friend.

1124
00:55:45,472 --> 00:55:48,100
I won't do it.
I've grown very fond of him.

1125
00:55:48,142 --> 00:55:51,441
This would be like telling him
I thought he was insane.

1126
00:55:51,478 --> 00:55:53,878
You don't call this
acting normal, do you?

1127
00:55:53,914 --> 00:55:55,438
Of course I don't...

1128
00:55:55,482 --> 00:55:57,882
but there are thousands
of elderly who aren't normal.

1129
00:55:57,918 --> 00:56:00,944
This will hurt Kris deeply,
and I don't want to do it!

1130
00:56:08,762 --> 00:56:10,730
That wouldn't be fair to him.

1131
00:56:10,764 --> 00:56:12,231
I'll tell him the truth.

1132
00:56:12,266 --> 00:56:14,393
I believe in being truthful
with people.

1133
00:56:14,435 --> 00:56:16,733
If he sees me
or you mention psychiatrist...

1134
00:56:16,770 --> 00:56:19,398
it's more or less attacking
his delusion again.

1135
00:56:19,440 --> 00:56:20,907
He's apt to become violent.

1136
00:56:20,941 --> 00:56:22,408
But in front of the children?

1137
00:56:22,443 --> 00:56:23,910
Oh, that would be terrible.

1138
00:56:23,944 --> 00:56:26,742
Get him out of the store
on some other pretext.

1139
00:56:26,780 --> 00:56:28,907
Then once outside,
I'll explain it to him.

1140
00:56:28,949 --> 00:56:30,940
If you think
it's better that way.

1141
00:56:32,486 --> 00:56:35,387
Keep a straight line.
All day long to see Santa Claus.

1142
00:56:37,958 --> 00:56:39,255
Oh!

1143
00:56:41,962 --> 00:56:43,259
- Mr. Kringle.
- Yes?

1144
00:56:43,297 --> 00:56:44,924
Mrs. Walker
wanted you to know...

1145
00:56:44,965 --> 00:56:46,933
that we're going to take
some publicity pictures...

1146
00:56:46,967 --> 00:56:49,765
this afternoon
down at the city hall...

1147
00:56:49,803 --> 00:56:50,929
you and the mayor.

1148
00:56:50,971 --> 00:56:52,438
Good. Like to meet him.

1149
00:56:52,473 --> 00:56:54,873
A few things
I'd like to discuss with him.

1150
00:56:54,908 --> 00:56:58,366
Oh, but I made an appointment
with Mr. Macy at 4:00.

1151
00:56:58,412 --> 00:57:00,380
I want to tell him
about something.

1152
00:57:00,414 --> 00:57:02,882
You'll be back
in plenty of time.

1153
00:57:02,916 --> 00:57:04,383
There's a car waiting
downstairs.

1154
00:57:04,418 --> 00:57:06,352
It's starting to drizzle.
You'll need a coat.

1155
00:57:06,387 --> 00:57:07,513
I'll get it.

1156
00:57:07,554 --> 00:57:08,987
Thanks. Be right with you.

1157
00:57:09,023 --> 00:57:11,890
I just want to take care
of a few kiddies first.

1158
00:57:11,925 --> 00:57:13,415
All right.

1159
00:57:36,717 --> 00:57:38,207
Where to?

1160
00:57:38,252 --> 00:57:39,719
Bellevue.

1161
00:57:39,753 --> 00:57:40,981
Bellevue?!

1162
00:57:49,797 --> 00:57:51,498
Did she know about this?

1163
00:57:51,631 --> 00:57:54,464
Yes.
We all discussed it.

1164
00:58:03,376 --> 00:58:04,843
The second party shall...

1165
00:58:04,878 --> 00:58:06,846
in consideration
of the property...

1166
00:58:06,880 --> 00:58:08,848
agree to be conveyed
by the first party to...

1167
00:58:08,882 --> 00:58:11,442
Excuse me, Gertrude. Telephone.

1168
00:58:13,887 --> 00:58:15,354
Hello.

1169
00:58:15,388 --> 00:58:17,379
Yes. Yes.

1170
00:58:18,424 --> 00:58:20,824
Why, yes,
we share an apartment together.

1171
00:58:23,096 --> 00:58:24,222
Bellevue?

1172
00:58:24,264 --> 00:58:27,097
But why, Doctor? What did he...

1173
00:58:27,133 --> 00:58:29,067
Oh, he's quite comfortable.

1174
00:58:29,102 --> 00:58:32,071
He's going to be with us
for a few days...

1175
00:58:32,105 --> 00:58:35,074
and wondered if you could bring
his personal things.

1176
00:58:35,108 --> 00:58:38,566
Yes, in view
of his examination...

1177
00:58:38,611 --> 00:58:42,877
I'm afraid I shall have
to recommend commitment.

1178
00:58:42,916 --> 00:58:44,884
Yes, I know, Mr. Gailey...

1179
00:58:44,918 --> 00:58:46,783
but I'd rather speak to you
in person.

1180
00:58:46,819 --> 00:58:48,377
I'll be right over, Doctor.

1181
00:58:55,361 --> 00:58:57,022
To see the new patient.

1182
00:58:57,063 --> 00:58:58,724
- Thanks.
- Not at all.

1183
00:59:08,241 --> 00:59:09,902
Hello, Kris.

1184
00:59:09,943 --> 00:59:11,843
Fred.

1185
00:59:11,878 --> 00:59:14,745
Why'd you do it, Kris?

1186
00:59:14,781 --> 00:59:17,773
You deliberately failed
that examination, didn't you?

1187
00:59:19,752 --> 00:59:21,083
Why?

1188
00:59:21,120 --> 00:59:25,113
Because the last few days
I've had great hope.

1189
00:59:25,158 --> 00:59:28,616
I had a feeling Doris was
beginning to believe in me.

1190
00:59:28,661 --> 00:59:32,119
And now I find out she was just
humoring me all the time.

1191
00:59:32,165 --> 00:59:33,632
I just telephoned her.

1192
00:59:33,666 --> 00:59:36,362
She didn't know anything about
taking pictures with the mayor.

1193
00:59:36,402 --> 00:59:38,370
That was Sawyer's idea.

1194
00:59:38,404 --> 00:59:40,065
Well, I'm glad of that.

1195
00:59:40,106 --> 00:59:43,667
But why didn't she come to me
and explain the whole thing?

1196
00:59:43,710 --> 00:59:46,144
She didn't want to hurt you.

1197
00:59:46,179 --> 00:59:49,376
Only because I was a nice,
kind old man she felt sorry for.

1198
00:59:49,415 --> 00:59:50,882
That's not true.

1199
00:59:50,917 --> 00:59:52,782
Yes, it is.
She had doubts.

1200
00:59:52,819 --> 00:59:54,081
That's why she was just sorry.

1201
00:59:54,120 --> 00:59:56,088
If you'd been dragged off here
instead of me...

1202
00:59:56,122 --> 00:59:57,680
she wouldn't have been sorry.

1203
00:59:57,724 --> 00:59:59,123
She'd have been furious.

1204
00:59:59,158 --> 01:00:02,184
All right,
she had doubts. Why not?

1205
01:00:02,228 --> 01:00:04,696
She hasn't really believed
in anything for years.

1206
01:00:04,731 --> 01:00:06,665
You can't expect her
to suddenly...

1207
01:00:06,699 --> 01:00:09,532
Oh, it's not just Doris.
There's Mr. Sawyer.

1208
01:00:09,569 --> 01:00:14,529
He's contemptible, dishonest,
selfish, deceitful, vicious...

1209
01:00:14,574 --> 01:00:17,202
Yet he's out there
and I'm in here.

1210
01:00:17,243 --> 01:00:19,643
He's called normal and I'm not.

1211
01:00:19,679 --> 01:00:21,704
Well, if that's normal,
I don't want it.

1212
01:00:21,748 --> 01:00:24,717
That's why
I answered incorrectly.

1213
01:00:24,751 --> 01:00:27,686
But, Kris, you can't
just think of yourself.

1214
01:00:27,720 --> 01:00:30,814
What happens to you matters
to a lot of people.

1215
01:00:30,857 --> 01:00:34,384
People like me, who believe
in what you stand for...

1216
01:00:34,427 --> 01:00:37,726
and people like Suzie,
who are just beginning to.

1217
01:00:37,764 --> 01:00:40,892
You can't quit.
You can't let them down.

1218
01:00:40,933 --> 01:00:42,833
No, I suppose I shouldn't.

1219
01:00:42,869 --> 01:00:45,702
Who knows, maybe someday
the Sawyers will be in here...

1220
01:00:45,738 --> 01:00:47,205
instead of out there.

1221
01:00:47,240 --> 01:00:50,232
You're right.
I ought to be ashamed of myself.

1222
01:00:50,276 --> 01:00:53,803
Even if we can't win,
we can go down swinging.

1223
01:00:53,846 --> 01:00:55,746
Let's get out of here.

1224
01:00:55,782 --> 01:00:57,249
Now, wait a minute.

1225
01:00:57,283 --> 01:01:00,309
You're forgetting you flunked
your examination but good.

1226
01:01:00,353 --> 01:01:02,321
Oh, yes, I forgot.

1227
01:01:02,355 --> 01:01:04,721
I said Calvin Coolidge
was the first president.

1228
01:01:04,757 --> 01:01:08,215
I can imagine what they're
thinking of me for saying that.

1229
01:01:08,261 --> 01:01:10,229
But you'll get me out of this.

1230
01:01:10,263 --> 01:01:11,787
You'll think of something.

1231
01:01:11,831 --> 01:01:13,298
It's not gonna be easy, Kris.

1232
01:01:13,332 --> 01:01:14,799
It will be for you.

1233
01:01:14,834 --> 01:01:17,268
I believe you're the greatest
lawyer since Darrow.

1234
01:01:17,303 --> 01:01:19,794
Just a second, Kris.
You're putting me in a bad spot.

1235
01:01:19,839 --> 01:01:22,899
But I believe in you.
You can't let me down.

1236
01:01:22,942 --> 01:01:24,967
But you don't understand. It...

1237
01:01:27,313 --> 01:01:29,907
I'll do everything I can, Kris.

1238
01:01:29,949 --> 01:01:31,075
Thank you.

1239
01:01:31,117 --> 01:01:33,347
- Good-bye.
- Good-bye.

1240
01:01:37,857 --> 01:01:40,155
That's a lot of nonsense!
Dangerous, my foot!

1241
01:01:40,193 --> 01:01:42,320
I don't care
if he failed ten examinations.

1242
01:01:42,361 --> 01:01:43,828
You had no right to do it!

1243
01:01:43,863 --> 01:01:46,331
You get the case
dropped tomorrow...

1244
01:01:46,365 --> 01:01:50,301
or you might have another lump
to match the one Kris gave you!

1245
01:01:50,336 --> 01:01:51,735
Yes, Mr. Macy.

1246
01:02:06,719 --> 01:02:08,243
Age unknown.

1247
01:02:08,287 --> 01:02:09,720
Old man, huh?

1248
01:02:09,756 --> 01:02:11,724
Very old, Your Honor.

1249
01:02:11,758 --> 01:02:14,454
I suppose
I'll have to read all this.

1250
01:02:14,494 --> 01:02:16,826
Take my word for it.
Just routine commitment papers.

1251
01:02:16,863 --> 01:02:18,330
Cut and dried.

1252
01:02:18,364 --> 01:02:20,229
The man calls himself
Kris Kringle...

1253
01:02:20,266 --> 01:02:21,995
thinks he's Santa Claus.

1254
01:02:22,034 --> 01:02:23,296
Uh-oh.

1255
01:02:25,972 --> 01:02:27,234
Come in.

1256
01:02:28,341 --> 01:02:30,639
Mr. Gailey to see you,
Your Honor.

1257
01:02:30,676 --> 01:02:31,973
He represents Mr. Kringle.

1258
01:02:33,446 --> 01:02:34,777
Better show him in.

1259
01:02:37,617 --> 01:02:38,948
Good morning.

1260
01:02:38,985 --> 01:02:41,579
Your Honor, there seems to be
undue haste in this case.

1261
01:02:41,621 --> 01:02:44,089
I wish to protect my client's
rights, as I'm sure you do.

1262
01:02:44,123 --> 01:02:45,249
Of course.

1263
01:02:45,291 --> 01:02:47,418
I request a formal hearing...

1264
01:02:47,460 --> 01:02:49,121
to which I may bring witnesses.

1265
01:02:49,162 --> 01:02:51,790
- This is cut and dried?
- That's what I was told.

1266
01:02:51,831 --> 01:02:53,731
I didn't know anything
about a protest.

1267
01:02:53,766 --> 01:02:56,633
Of course, you may sign
the commitment papers now...

1268
01:02:56,669 --> 01:02:58,330
but I'll bring
a habeas corpus later.

1269
01:02:58,371 --> 01:03:00,839
There's no point in signing.

1270
01:03:00,873 --> 01:03:05,537
We'll have a hearing
on Monday morning at 10:00.

1271
01:03:05,578 --> 01:03:07,603
Thank you. Good day.

1272
01:03:12,285 --> 01:03:13,775
Thank you.

1273
01:03:18,790 --> 01:03:20,087
That man...

1274
01:03:20,125 --> 01:03:23,253
I heard him say something
about Mr. Kringle before.

1275
01:03:23,295 --> 01:03:24,762
Who is he?

1276
01:03:24,796 --> 01:03:26,263
His name is Gailey,
Kringle's lawyer.

1277
01:03:26,298 --> 01:03:29,267
Probably grabbed the case
to get some cheap publicity.

1278
01:03:29,301 --> 01:03:32,270
We can't have that.
Mr. Macy would rather drop this.

1279
01:03:32,304 --> 01:03:33,771
It can't be done.
It's too late now.

1280
01:03:33,805 --> 01:03:36,273
Kringle has been examined by
city hospital psychiatrists.

1281
01:03:36,308 --> 01:03:37,866
It has to follow due process.

1282
01:03:37,909 --> 01:03:39,877
We must avoid publicity.

1283
01:03:39,911 --> 01:03:41,401
I, uh... Oh.

1284
01:03:50,222 --> 01:03:52,884
Mr. Gailey,
I represent Mr. Macy.

1285
01:03:52,924 --> 01:03:54,323
My name's Sawyer.

1286
01:03:54,359 --> 01:03:55,826
Oh, so you're Sawyer.

1287
01:03:55,861 --> 01:03:57,886
Yes.
Regarding this Kringle matter...

1288
01:03:57,929 --> 01:04:00,056
We're very anxious
to avoid any publicity.

1289
01:04:00,098 --> 01:04:01,326
Naturally.

1290
01:04:01,366 --> 01:04:04,563
So if you would agree
to put this through quietly...

1291
01:04:04,603 --> 01:04:07,834
we'd surely find a generous way
to express our appreciation.

1292
01:04:07,873 --> 01:04:09,033
Very interesting.

1293
01:04:09,074 --> 01:04:10,837
Then you'll cooperate?

1294
01:04:10,876 --> 01:04:13,743
Very interesting.
Publicity. Hmm.

1295
01:04:13,779 --> 01:04:15,542
That's not a bad idea.

1296
01:04:15,580 --> 01:04:17,411
If I'm going to win this case...

1297
01:04:17,449 --> 01:04:19,747
I'll have to have plenty
of public opinion.

1298
01:04:19,785 --> 01:04:22,083
And publicity's
just the way to do it.

1299
01:04:24,423 --> 01:04:26,891
Thanks, Mr. Sawyer.

1300
01:04:26,925 --> 01:04:30,554
Oh, Mr. Gailey, wait a minute.

1301
01:04:30,595 --> 01:04:33,086
Mr. Gailey, one moment, please!

1302
01:04:58,423 --> 01:05:01,221
I don't see what
they're making a fuss about.

1303
01:05:01,259 --> 01:05:02,726
After all, he's an old man.

1304
01:05:02,761 --> 01:05:04,729
How've you been feeling lately?

1305
01:05:04,763 --> 01:05:06,355
You look a little run-down.

1306
01:05:06,398 --> 01:05:09,367
Me? Why, I feel fine.
Never better.

1307
01:05:09,401 --> 01:05:11,869
Why not see the doc?
Take a few weeks off.

1308
01:05:11,903 --> 01:05:14,872
Go fishing, go hunting.
Go anyplace.

1309
01:05:14,906 --> 01:05:16,874
Why should I?

1310
01:05:16,908 --> 01:05:18,899
Because
this Kringle case is dynamite.

1311
01:05:18,944 --> 01:05:21,913
Let some judge handle it that
isn't coming up for reelection.

1312
01:05:21,947 --> 01:05:23,380
I can't do that.

1313
01:05:23,415 --> 01:05:24,882
I'm no legal brain trust.

1314
01:05:24,916 --> 01:05:27,749
I don't know
a habeas from a corpus.

1315
01:05:27,786 --> 01:05:30,254
But I do know politics.
That's my racket.

1316
01:05:30,288 --> 01:05:31,915
I got you elected, didn't I?

1317
01:05:31,957 --> 01:05:34,084
And I'm gonna try
to get you reelected.

1318
01:05:34,126 --> 01:05:37,926
I appreciate everything
that you've done for me.

1319
01:05:37,963 --> 01:05:39,726
Then get off this case.

1320
01:05:39,764 --> 01:05:41,254
But why?

1321
01:05:41,299 --> 01:05:44,496
You're a Pontius Pilate
the minute you start.

1322
01:05:44,536 --> 01:05:47,130
Oh, I don't believe it.

1323
01:05:47,172 --> 01:05:48,764
I'm an honest man...

1324
01:05:48,807 --> 01:05:50,775
and nobody's going
to hold it against me...

1325
01:05:50,809 --> 01:05:52,743
for doing my duty as I see it.

1326
01:05:53,678 --> 01:05:55,646
Grandma!

1327
01:05:55,680 --> 01:05:56,942
Grandma!

1328
01:05:56,982 --> 01:05:58,472
Grandma!

1329
01:05:58,517 --> 01:06:00,007
Good night, Terry.

1330
01:06:00,051 --> 01:06:01,518
Good night, Alice.

1331
01:06:01,553 --> 01:06:03,020
Now, straight to bed.

1332
01:06:03,054 --> 01:06:05,488
I promised your mother
you'd be in bed by 8:00...

1333
01:06:05,524 --> 01:06:06,650
and it's way past.

1334
01:06:06,691 --> 01:06:08,488
Aren't you coming, too?

1335
01:06:08,527 --> 01:06:11,121
I'll be up soon
to tuck you in. Now, scoot!

1336
01:06:11,163 --> 01:06:15,623
How about a great big kiss
for Grandpa, hmm?

1337
01:06:17,769 --> 01:06:18,895
Hmmph!

1338
01:06:18,937 --> 01:06:20,097
Hmmph!

1339
01:06:21,106 --> 01:06:23,574
Fine way
to treat their grandfather!

1340
01:06:23,608 --> 01:06:25,235
No hug, no kiss, no anything.

1341
01:06:25,277 --> 01:06:26,744
I don't blame them.

1342
01:06:26,778 --> 01:06:29,338
Any man who'd put Santa Claus
on trial for lunacy.

1343
01:06:30,649 --> 01:06:32,480
See what I mean?

1344
01:06:37,822 --> 01:06:39,449
Hey.

1345
01:06:55,207 --> 01:06:56,367
Don't worry about me.

1346
01:06:56,408 --> 01:06:58,239
I've got the best lawyer
in the worid.

1347
01:06:58,276 --> 01:07:00,039
How long do you think
this will take?

1348
01:07:00,078 --> 01:07:01,272
Maybe a week.

1349
01:07:01,313 --> 01:07:03,042
A week?! That seems impossible!

1350
01:07:03,081 --> 01:07:05,049
That lawyer
won't be stupid enough...

1351
01:07:05,083 --> 01:07:07,677
to let him admit anything.
He'll deny everything.

1352
01:07:07,719 --> 01:07:09,778
I'll bring witnesses,
and he'll bring witnesses.

1353
01:07:10,989 --> 01:07:12,684
Hear ye, hear ye.

1354
01:07:12,724 --> 01:07:14,692
All persons having business...

1355
01:07:14,726 --> 01:07:19,186
with the supreme court
of the county of New York...

1356
01:07:19,231 --> 01:07:21,927
draw near, give attendance,
and ye shall be heard.

1357
01:07:24,402 --> 01:07:27,860
You have Kris Kringle's
commitment papers.

1358
01:07:27,906 --> 01:07:31,364
I'd like to call
the first witness.

1359
01:07:31,409 --> 01:07:34,901
Mr. Kringle,
will you take the stand?

1360
01:07:46,791 --> 01:07:48,258
Good morning, Your Honor.

1361
01:07:48,293 --> 01:07:50,284
You do solemnly swear...

1362
01:07:50,328 --> 01:07:54,230
the testimony you'll give
shall be the whole truth...

1363
01:07:54,266 --> 01:07:56,234
so help you God?

1364
01:07:56,268 --> 01:07:57,462
I do.

1365
01:07:57,502 --> 01:08:00,562
Before you begin, I want
to explain to the witness...

1366
01:08:00,605 --> 01:08:02,300
this is a hearing, not a trial.

1367
01:08:02,340 --> 01:08:03,864
Mr. Kringle...

1368
01:08:03,908 --> 01:08:06,274
you don't have to answer
against your wishes...

1369
01:08:06,311 --> 01:08:08,939
or even testify at all.

1370
01:08:08,980 --> 01:08:10,743
We have no objection,
Your Honor.

1371
01:08:12,484 --> 01:08:14,884
I'll be glad to answer
any questions I can.

1372
01:08:16,921 --> 01:08:18,912
What is your name?

1373
01:08:18,957 --> 01:08:20,117
Kris Kringle.

1374
01:08:21,760 --> 01:08:23,227
Where do you live?

1375
01:08:23,261 --> 01:08:25,729
That's what this hearing
will decide.

1376
01:08:31,369 --> 01:08:33,929
A very sound answer,
Mr. Kringle.

1377
01:08:35,774 --> 01:08:37,935
Do you believe
that you're Santa Claus?

1378
01:08:37,976 --> 01:08:39,637
Of course.

1379
01:08:44,983 --> 01:08:47,474
The state rests, Your Honor.

1380
01:08:55,226 --> 01:08:56,693
Well, Mr. Gailey...

1381
01:08:56,728 --> 01:08:59,196
do you wish to cross-examine
the witness?

1382
01:08:59,230 --> 01:09:01,391
I believe he was employed
to play Santa Claus.

1383
01:09:01,433 --> 01:09:04,027
Perhaps he didn't understand
the question correctly.

1384
01:09:04,069 --> 01:09:06,663
Oh, I understood perfectly,
Your Honor.

1385
01:09:10,942 --> 01:09:13,410
No further questions
at this time.

1386
01:09:16,915 --> 01:09:18,507
Thank you.

1387
01:09:21,920 --> 01:09:23,581
In view of this statement...

1388
01:09:23,621 --> 01:09:26,556
do you still wish
to put in a defense?

1389
01:09:26,591 --> 01:09:28,559
I do, Your Honor.

1390
01:09:28,593 --> 01:09:31,892
I'm fully aware
of my client's opinions.

1391
01:09:31,930 --> 01:09:33,261
That's the entire case
against him.

1392
01:09:33,298 --> 01:09:36,790
All these complicated tests
boil down to this:

1393
01:09:36,835 --> 01:09:39,030
Mr. Kringle is not sane...

1394
01:09:39,070 --> 01:09:40,867
because he believes himself
to be Santa Claus.

1395
01:09:40,905 --> 01:09:42,236
An entirely logical...

1396
01:09:42,273 --> 01:09:44,867
and reasonable assumption,
I'm afraid.

1397
01:09:44,909 --> 01:09:48,242
It would be if the clerk,
Mr. Marrah, or I...

1398
01:09:48,279 --> 01:09:49,837
believed we were Santa Claus.

1399
01:09:49,881 --> 01:09:52,543
Anyone who thinks
he's Santa Claus is not sane.

1400
01:09:52,584 --> 01:09:54,142
Not necessarily.

1401
01:09:54,185 --> 01:09:56,653
You believe yourself
to be Judge Harper...

1402
01:09:56,688 --> 01:09:59,953
yet no one questions your sanity
because you are Judge Harper.

1403
01:09:59,991 --> 01:10:02,687
I know all about myself,
young man.

1404
01:10:02,727 --> 01:10:04,524
Mr. Kringle is the subject
of this hearing.

1405
01:10:04,562 --> 01:10:05,722
Yes, Your Honor...

1406
01:10:05,764 --> 01:10:08,699
and if he is the person
he believes himself to be...

1407
01:10:08,733 --> 01:10:11,827
just as you are,
then he's just as sane.

1408
01:10:11,870 --> 01:10:13,030
Granted, but he isn't.

1409
01:10:13,071 --> 01:10:14,197
Oh, but he is.

1410
01:10:14,239 --> 01:10:15,907
Is what?

1411
01:10:16,040 --> 01:10:19,009
I intend to prove
that Mr. Kringle is Santa Claus.

1412
01:10:20,745 --> 01:10:22,872
He's crazy, too!

1413
01:10:35,326 --> 01:10:37,760
Hi, darling.

1414
01:10:37,795 --> 01:10:40,628
Sorry I'm late. Get your coat.
I reserved our table at Luigi's.

1415
01:10:40,665 --> 01:10:41,791
We're gonna celebrate.

1416
01:10:41,832 --> 01:10:43,265
What are we celebrating?

1417
01:10:43,301 --> 01:10:45,769
Read all about it.
"Gailey Throws Court Bombshell."

1418
01:10:45,803 --> 01:10:47,771
Yes, I read that.

1419
01:10:47,805 --> 01:10:50,774
I didn't see this...
Front page! Good. Good.

1420
01:10:50,808 --> 01:10:52,742
You're not serious about this?

1421
01:10:52,777 --> 01:10:54,244
Of course I am.

1422
01:10:54,278 --> 01:10:56,746
But you can't possibly
prove he's Santa Claus.

1423
01:10:56,781 --> 01:10:59,306
Why not? You saw Macy
and Gimbel shaking hands.

1424
01:10:59,350 --> 01:11:01,818
That wasn't possible either,
but it happened.

1425
01:11:01,852 --> 01:11:03,285
It's the best defense I can use.

1426
01:11:03,321 --> 01:11:05,789
Completely logical
and completely unexpected.

1427
01:11:05,823 --> 01:11:07,313
And completely idiotic.

1428
01:11:07,358 --> 01:11:08,825
What about your bosses...

1429
01:11:08,859 --> 01:11:10,588
Haislip and Mackenzie
and the rest?

1430
01:11:10,628 --> 01:11:11,754
What do they say?

1431
01:11:11,796 --> 01:11:13,764
That I'm jeopardizing
the prestige and dignity...

1432
01:11:13,798 --> 01:11:15,766
of an old, established
law firm...

1433
01:11:15,800 --> 01:11:18,268
and either I drop this
impossible case immediately...

1434
01:11:18,302 --> 01:11:19,769
or they will drop me.

1435
01:11:19,804 --> 01:11:21,328
I beat them to it. I quit.

1436
01:11:21,372 --> 01:11:22,839
Fred, you didn't.

1437
01:11:22,873 --> 01:11:25,034
Of course I did.
I can't let Kris down.

1438
01:11:25,076 --> 01:11:27,840
He needs me,
and all the rest of us need him.

1439
01:11:27,878 --> 01:11:29,641
Darling,
he's a nice old man...

1440
01:11:29,680 --> 01:11:33,582
and I admire you
for wanting to help him...

1441
01:11:33,617 --> 01:11:36,085
but you've got to be realistic
and face facts.

1442
01:11:36,120 --> 01:11:38,088
You can't just
throw your career away...

1443
01:11:38,122 --> 01:11:39,783
because of a sentimental whim.

1444
01:11:39,824 --> 01:11:41,792
But I'm not
throwing my career away.

1445
01:11:41,826 --> 01:11:43,794
If Haislip feels that way...

1446
01:11:43,828 --> 01:11:45,796
so will every other law firm.

1447
01:11:45,830 --> 01:11:48,298
I'm sure they will.
I'll open my own office.

1448
01:11:48,332 --> 01:11:50,800
What kind of cases will you get?

1449
01:11:50,835 --> 01:11:53,804
Probably people like
Kris who are being bullied.

1450
01:11:53,838 --> 01:11:55,806
That's the only fun in law
anyway.

1451
01:11:55,840 --> 01:11:58,741
If you believe in me
and have faith in me...

1452
01:11:58,776 --> 01:12:00,573
everything will...

1453
01:12:02,079 --> 01:12:05,242
You don't have any faith in me,
do you?

1454
01:12:05,282 --> 01:12:08,945
It's not about faith.
It's just common sense.

1455
01:12:10,788 --> 01:12:12,915
Faith is believing in things...

1456
01:12:12,957 --> 01:12:15,755
when common sense
tells you not to.

1457
01:12:15,793 --> 01:12:18,353
It's not just Kris
that's on trial.

1458
01:12:18,396 --> 01:12:19,920
It's everything he stands for.

1459
01:12:19,964 --> 01:12:21,989
It's kindness, joy, love,
and all other intangibles.

1460
01:12:22,033 --> 01:12:23,864
Fred,
you're talking like a child.

1461
01:12:23,901 --> 01:12:25,391
You're living
in a realistic worid!

1462
01:12:25,436 --> 01:12:26,903
Those lovely intangibles
aren't worth much.

1463
01:12:26,937 --> 01:12:28,427
You don't get ahead that way.

1464
01:12:28,472 --> 01:12:31,270
That all depends
on what you call getting ahead.

1465
01:12:31,308 --> 01:12:33,276
Evidently,
we have different definitions.

1466
01:12:33,310 --> 01:12:35,778
We've talked
about wonderful plans.

1467
01:12:35,813 --> 01:12:37,940
Then you go
on an idealistic binge.

1468
01:12:37,982 --> 01:12:40,780
You give up your job,
throw away your security...

1469
01:12:40,818 --> 01:12:43,946
and then you expect me
to be happy about it!

1470
01:12:43,988 --> 01:12:47,287
Yes,
I guess I expected too much.

1471
01:12:47,324 --> 01:12:49,451
Someday,
you're going to find out...

1472
01:12:49,493 --> 01:12:51,290
that your way of facing
this realistic worid...

1473
01:12:51,328 --> 01:12:52,795
just doesn't work.

1474
01:12:52,830 --> 01:12:54,229
And when you do...

1475
01:12:54,265 --> 01:12:56,062
don't overlook
those lovely intangibles.

1476
01:12:56,100 --> 01:12:57,897
You'll discover
they're the only things...

1477
01:12:57,935 --> 01:12:59,266
that are worthwhile.

1478
01:13:07,778 --> 01:13:10,338
These reporters make me
look like a sadistic monster...

1479
01:13:10,381 --> 01:13:11,848
who likes to drown cats...

1480
01:13:11,882 --> 01:13:13,747
and tear the wings
off butterflies.

1481
01:13:13,784 --> 01:13:14,910
Why, this old man...

1482
01:13:14,952 --> 01:13:18,410
Tommy, go get
mother's scissors, will you?

1483
01:13:18,456 --> 01:13:20,424
They're in the bedroom.

1484
01:13:20,458 --> 01:13:22,449
That's a good boy.

1485
01:13:23,894 --> 01:13:26,362
I don't want to discuss
this case in front of him.

1486
01:13:26,397 --> 01:13:28,262
It'll break his heart.

1487
01:13:28,299 --> 01:13:30,267
While we're on the subject,
I agree with the reporters.

1488
01:13:30,301 --> 01:13:32,269
Mr. Kringle seems
to be a nice old man.

1489
01:13:32,303 --> 01:13:34,771
I don't see why you have
to keep persecuting him.

1490
01:13:34,805 --> 01:13:36,773
Firstly,
I am not persecuting him.

1491
01:13:36,807 --> 01:13:38,274
I am prosecuting him.

1492
01:13:38,309 --> 01:13:40,937
And secondly,
I like the old man, too.

1493
01:13:40,978 --> 01:13:43,276
I wish
I'd never gotten into this.

1494
01:13:43,314 --> 01:13:45,782
But it's too late now. There's
nothing I can do about it.

1495
01:13:45,816 --> 01:13:47,784
It's up to the state
of New York.

1496
01:13:47,818 --> 01:13:49,285
I'm their duly appointed
legal representative.

1497
01:13:49,320 --> 01:13:51,288
Kringle has been declared
a menace to society...

1498
01:13:51,322 --> 01:13:52,949
by competent doctors.

1499
01:13:52,990 --> 01:13:55,220
It's my duty to protect
the state of New York...

1500
01:13:55,259 --> 01:13:56,886
and see that he's put away.

1501
01:13:56,927 --> 01:13:58,827
No matter what they say
about me...

1502
01:13:58,863 --> 01:14:00,387
I've got to do it.

1503
01:14:00,431 --> 01:14:03,730
Sometimes I wish I'd married
a butcher or a plumber.

1504
01:14:03,767 --> 01:14:06,395
Well, my dear,
if I lose this case...

1505
01:14:06,437 --> 01:14:08,769
it's very possible
that you'll get your wish.

1506
01:14:20,784 --> 01:14:22,183
Hello, Kris.

1507
01:14:34,131 --> 01:14:35,598
Your name?

1508
01:14:35,633 --> 01:14:37,032
R.H. Macy.

1509
01:14:37,067 --> 01:14:38,193
You are the owner...

1510
01:14:38,235 --> 01:14:39,702
of one of the biggest
department stores...

1511
01:14:39,737 --> 01:14:40,965
in New York City?

1512
01:14:41,005 --> 01:14:42,131
The biggest.

1513
01:14:42,173 --> 01:14:45,574
Who is the gentleman
seated there?

1514
01:14:45,609 --> 01:14:46,803
Kris Kringle.

1515
01:14:46,844 --> 01:14:48,277
- Your employee?
- Yes.

1516
01:14:48,312 --> 01:14:49,939
Do you believe him
to be truthful?

1517
01:14:49,980 --> 01:14:51,106
Yes.

1518
01:14:51,148 --> 01:14:53,284
You believe him to be
of sound mind?

1519
01:14:53,319 --> 01:14:54,376
I certainly do.

1520
01:14:54,418 --> 01:14:56,215
Mr. Macy, you're under oath.

1521
01:14:56,253 --> 01:14:58,414
You really believe
this man is Santa Claus?

1522
01:14:58,455 --> 01:15:00,753
Well, I...

1523
01:15:05,429 --> 01:15:07,989
Well, he gives
every indication...

1524
01:15:08,032 --> 01:15:11,433
Do you really believe
he's Santa Claus?

1525
01:15:19,777 --> 01:15:21,267
I do.

1526
01:15:21,312 --> 01:15:22,438
You do?

1527
01:15:22,479 --> 01:15:23,969
That's all.

1528
01:15:36,627 --> 01:15:38,322
Psychologist!

1529
01:15:38,362 --> 01:15:41,456
Where'd you graduate from,
a correspondence school?

1530
01:15:42,466 --> 01:15:43,956
You're fired.

1531
01:15:45,736 --> 01:15:47,761
Your Honor,
I object to this testimony.

1532
01:15:47,805 --> 01:15:49,773
It's ridiculous, irrelevant,
and immaterial.

1533
01:15:49,807 --> 01:15:51,934
Mr. Gailey is making
a circus of this court.

1534
01:15:51,976 --> 01:15:53,705
There is no such person
as Santa Claus...

1535
01:15:53,744 --> 01:15:55,211
and everybody knows it.

1536
01:15:55,246 --> 01:15:57,714
I submit
it's purely a matter of opinion.

1537
01:15:57,748 --> 01:16:00,114
Can Mr. Marrah disprove
Santa's existence?

1538
01:16:00,150 --> 01:16:01,879
No. I don't intend to.

1539
01:16:01,919 --> 01:16:04,353
This isn't a nursery. It's the
New York State Supreme Court.

1540
01:16:04,388 --> 01:16:06,879
I'll not waste this court's time
with such nonsense!

1541
01:16:06,924 --> 01:16:08,892
Mr. Marrah seems to have
appointed himself judge.

1542
01:16:08,926 --> 01:16:11,895
He's ruling on what testimony
I may introduce.

1543
01:16:11,929 --> 01:16:14,727
We request an immediate
ruling from this court.

1544
01:16:14,765 --> 01:16:17,290
Is there or is there not
a Santa Claus?

1545
01:16:19,436 --> 01:16:20,903
Well...

1546
01:16:20,938 --> 01:16:22,735
Ahem!

1547
01:16:28,445 --> 01:16:31,846
The court will take a recess
to consider the matter.

1548
01:16:34,785 --> 01:16:37,754
I don't care what you do
with old whisker puss...

1549
01:16:37,788 --> 01:16:40,256
but if you rule
that there's no Santa Claus...

1550
01:16:40,291 --> 01:16:42,759
you better start looking
for that chicken farm.

1551
01:16:42,793 --> 01:16:46,251
We won't even be able
to put you in the primaries.

1552
01:16:46,297 --> 01:16:48,288
But, Charley, listen to reason.

1553
01:16:48,332 --> 01:16:50,300
I'm a responsible judge.

1554
01:16:50,334 --> 01:16:52,302
I've taken an oath.

1555
01:16:52,336 --> 01:16:55,328
How can I seriously rule
there is a Santa Claus?

1556
01:16:55,372 --> 01:16:57,363
Why don't you...

1557
01:16:58,876 --> 01:17:00,343
All right.

1558
01:17:00,377 --> 01:17:03,835
Tell them the New York
State Supreme Court rules...

1559
01:17:03,881 --> 01:17:05,348
there's no Santa Claus.

1560
01:17:05,382 --> 01:17:06,610
It's all over the papers.

1561
01:17:06,650 --> 01:17:08,845
The kids don't hang up
their stockings.

1562
01:17:08,886 --> 01:17:11,184
Now, what happens
to all the toys...

1563
01:17:11,221 --> 01:17:13,348
that are supposed to be
in those stockings?

1564
01:17:13,390 --> 01:17:14,857
Nobody buys them.

1565
01:17:14,892 --> 01:17:17,360
The toy manufacturers
are going to like that.

1566
01:17:17,394 --> 01:17:20,557
So they have to lay off
a lot of their employees...

1567
01:17:20,597 --> 01:17:22,565
union employees.

1568
01:17:22,599 --> 01:17:26,228
Now you got the C.I.O.
And the A.F.L. against you.

1569
01:17:26,270 --> 01:17:28,740
And they're gonna adore you
for it.

1570
01:17:28,873 --> 01:17:31,967
And they're gonna say it
with votes.

1571
01:17:32,009 --> 01:17:34,910
And the department stores
will love you, too...

1572
01:17:34,946 --> 01:17:37,574
and the Christmas card makers...

1573
01:17:37,615 --> 01:17:39,082
and the candy companies.

1574
01:17:39,117 --> 01:17:43,918
Oh, Henry, you're going to be
an awful popular fellow.

1575
01:17:43,955 --> 01:17:46,321
And what about
the Salvation Army?

1576
01:17:46,357 --> 01:17:48,848
Why, they got a Santa Claus
on every corner...

1577
01:17:48,893 --> 01:17:50,554
and they take in a fortune.

1578
01:17:50,595 --> 01:17:51,926
But you go ahead, Henry.

1579
01:17:51,963 --> 01:17:54,193
You do it your way.

1580
01:17:54,232 --> 01:17:56,700
You go on back in there
and tell them...

1581
01:17:56,734 --> 01:17:59,794
that you rule
there's no Santa Claus.

1582
01:18:00,805 --> 01:18:03,205
But if you do, remember this:

1583
01:18:03,241 --> 01:18:05,072
You can count on getting
just two votes...

1584
01:18:05,109 --> 01:18:07,873
your own and that
district attorney's out there.

1585
01:18:10,414 --> 01:18:12,609
The district attorney's
a Republican.

1586
01:18:13,818 --> 01:18:14,978
All rise!

1587
01:18:31,936 --> 01:18:33,904
Before making a ruling...

1588
01:18:33,938 --> 01:18:38,034
this court has consulted
the highest authority available.

1589
01:18:40,178 --> 01:18:42,237
The question of Santa Claus...

1590
01:18:42,280 --> 01:18:44,510
seems to be largely
a matter of opinion.

1591
01:18:44,549 --> 01:18:47,416
Many people
firmly believe in him.

1592
01:18:47,451 --> 01:18:49,419
Others do not.

1593
01:18:49,453 --> 01:18:52,616
The tradition
of American justice demands...

1594
01:18:52,657 --> 01:18:56,650
a broad, unprejudiced view
of such a controversial matter.

1595
01:18:56,694 --> 01:19:01,688
This court, therefore,
intends to keep an open mind.

1596
01:19:01,732 --> 01:19:03,529
I'll hear all the evidence.

1597
01:19:03,568 --> 01:19:05,399
He's crazy, too.

1598
01:19:07,071 --> 01:19:10,199
The burden of proof for this
ridiculous contention...

1599
01:19:10,241 --> 01:19:11,708
clearly rests with my opponent.

1600
01:19:11,742 --> 01:19:14,711
Can he produce evidence
to support his views?

1601
01:19:14,745 --> 01:19:16,713
If Your Honor pleases, I can.

1602
01:19:16,747 --> 01:19:18,214
Will Thomas Marrah
please take the stand?

1603
01:19:18,249 --> 01:19:19,409
Who, me?

1604
01:19:19,450 --> 01:19:21,475
Thomas Marrah, Jr.

1605
01:19:32,897 --> 01:19:34,387
Hello, Daddy.

1606
01:19:36,868 --> 01:19:38,859
Here you are, Tommy.

1607
01:19:41,505 --> 01:19:43,973
Tommy,
you know the difference...

1608
01:19:44,008 --> 01:19:46,533
between telling the truth
and telling a lie, right?

1609
01:19:46,577 --> 01:19:50,104
Everybody knows you
shouldn't tell a lie...

1610
01:19:50,147 --> 01:19:52,172
especially in court.

1611
01:19:53,818 --> 01:19:55,183
Proceed, Mr. Gailey.

1612
01:19:55,219 --> 01:19:56,948
Do you believe in Santa Claus?

1613
01:19:56,988 --> 01:19:58,922
Sure I do.

1614
01:19:58,956 --> 01:20:03,052
He gave me a brand-new
flexible flyer sled last year.

1615
01:20:03,094 --> 01:20:06,427
And what does he look like?

1616
01:20:06,464 --> 01:20:08,955
There he is, sitting there.

1617
01:20:09,000 --> 01:20:10,558
Your Honor, I protest!

1618
01:20:11,969 --> 01:20:13,960
Overruled.

1619
01:20:15,406 --> 01:20:16,703
Tell me, Tommy...

1620
01:20:16,741 --> 01:20:19,938
why are you so sure
there's a Santa Claus?

1621
01:20:19,977 --> 01:20:22,946
Because my daddy told me so.

1622
01:20:22,980 --> 01:20:24,641
Didn't you, Daddy?

1623
01:20:26,784 --> 01:20:28,718
You believe your daddy,
don't you?

1624
01:20:28,753 --> 01:20:30,448
He's a very honest man.

1625
01:20:30,488 --> 01:20:31,648
Of course he is.

1626
01:20:31,689 --> 01:20:34,658
My daddy wouldn't tell me
anything that wasn't so.

1627
01:20:34,692 --> 01:20:36,660
Would you, Daddy?

1628
01:20:39,397 --> 01:20:40,762
Thank you, Tommy.

1629
01:20:44,468 --> 01:20:45,594
Good-bye, Daddy.

1630
01:20:46,804 --> 01:20:49,034
Your Honor...

1631
01:20:49,073 --> 01:20:52,042
Don't forget.
A real official football helmet.

1632
01:20:52,076 --> 01:20:54,806
Don't worry, Tommy.
You'll get it.

1633
01:21:12,797 --> 01:21:14,264
Your Honor,
the state of New York...

1634
01:21:14,298 --> 01:21:16,630
concedes the existence
of Santa Claus.

1635
01:21:22,773 --> 01:21:26,231
But we ask that Mr. Gailey
cease presenting...

1636
01:21:26,277 --> 01:21:28,245
personal opinion as evidence.

1637
01:21:28,279 --> 01:21:31,112
We could bring witnesses
with opposite opinions...

1638
01:21:31,148 --> 01:21:33,378
but we desire
to shorten this hearing...

1639
01:21:33,417 --> 01:21:35,248
rather than prolong it.

1640
01:21:35,286 --> 01:21:37,254
I request that Mr. Gailey...

1641
01:21:37,288 --> 01:21:38,778
now submit
authoritative proof...

1642
01:21:38,823 --> 01:21:40,381
that Mr. Kringle...

1643
01:21:40,424 --> 01:21:43,018
is the one-and-only Santa Claus.

1644
01:21:44,328 --> 01:21:46,193
Your point's well taken.

1645
01:21:46,230 --> 01:21:48,926
I'm afraid we must agree.

1646
01:21:53,771 --> 01:21:57,730
Mr. Gailey, can you show that
Mr. Kringle is Santa Claus...

1647
01:21:57,775 --> 01:22:00,039
on the basis
of competent authority?

1648
01:22:01,746 --> 01:22:03,714
Not at this time, Your Honor.

1649
01:22:03,748 --> 01:22:06,342
I ask for an adjournment
until tomorrow.

1650
01:22:06,384 --> 01:22:09,217
Court stands adjourned
till tomorrow afternoon, 3:00.

1651
01:22:14,825 --> 01:22:17,293
Well, I guess that's that.

1652
01:22:17,328 --> 01:22:19,057
There's a way, Alfred.

1653
01:22:19,096 --> 01:22:20,654
There's got to be!

1654
01:22:26,337 --> 01:22:28,305
It's hard to explain.

1655
01:22:28,339 --> 01:22:31,308
They're having a trial
about him.

1656
01:22:31,342 --> 01:22:33,310
You mean like for murder?

1657
01:22:33,344 --> 01:22:35,278
No, it isn't that kind
of a trial.

1658
01:22:35,312 --> 01:22:37,803
It's just because
he says he's Santa Claus.

1659
01:22:37,848 --> 01:22:40,817
I've got a feeling
he is Santa Claus.

1660
01:22:40,851 --> 01:22:43,786
Some people don't
believe that. That's why...

1661
01:22:43,821 --> 01:22:46,790
But he's so kind
and nice and jolly.

1662
01:22:46,824 --> 01:22:49,292
He's not like anyone else.

1663
01:22:49,326 --> 01:22:51,294
He must be Santa.

1664
01:22:51,328 --> 01:22:53,558
I think
perhaps you're right, Suzie.

1665
01:22:53,597 --> 01:22:56,760
Is Mr. Kringle sad now,
Mother?

1666
01:22:56,801 --> 01:22:58,769
I'm afraid he is.

1667
01:22:58,803 --> 01:23:01,271
I'm sure he misses you.

1668
01:23:01,305 --> 01:23:04,934
Then I'll write him
a letter and cheer him up.

1669
01:24:16,814 --> 01:24:19,078
Hey, Lou, come here!

1670
01:24:19,116 --> 01:24:20,242
Yeah?

1671
01:24:20,284 --> 01:24:21,751
Here's a new one.

1672
01:24:21,785 --> 01:24:23,776
I seen them write
to Santa Claus...

1673
01:24:23,821 --> 01:24:26,255
North Pole, South Pole,
and every other place.

1674
01:24:26,290 --> 01:24:27,757
This kid writes...

1675
01:24:27,791 --> 01:24:29,782
"Kris Kringle,
New York County Courthouse."

1676
01:24:29,827 --> 01:24:32,762
The kid's right.
They got him on trial there.

1677
01:24:32,796 --> 01:24:36,596
He claims he's Santa Claus,
and the D.A. Claims he's nuts.

1678
01:24:36,633 --> 01:24:39,796
Read it for yourself.
Right on the front page.

1679
01:24:43,340 --> 01:24:47,140
Hey, Lou,
how many Santa Claus letters...

1680
01:24:47,177 --> 01:24:48,804
we got
at the dead-letter office?

1681
01:24:48,846 --> 01:24:50,313
I don't know.

1682
01:24:50,347 --> 01:24:52,315
There must be
about 50,000 of them.

1683
01:24:52,349 --> 01:24:54,249
Bags and bags
all over the joint.

1684
01:24:54,284 --> 01:24:56,752
And there's more coming in
every day.

1685
01:24:56,787 --> 01:24:58,254
Yeah. Hey, Lou.

1686
01:24:58,288 --> 01:25:02,748
It'd be nice
to get rid of them, huh?

1687
01:25:02,793 --> 01:25:04,761
Yeah, but...

1688
01:25:04,795 --> 01:25:07,263
Hey, that's a wonderful idea!

1689
01:25:07,297 --> 01:25:10,266
Why should we be
bothered with all that stuff?

1690
01:25:10,300 --> 01:25:12,734
Why not get some trucks?
Big ones right away.

1691
01:25:12,770 --> 01:25:15,762
Load them with Santa Claus mail
and deliver it...

1692
01:25:15,806 --> 01:25:18,240
to Mr. Kringle
at the courthouse.

1693
01:25:18,275 --> 01:25:21,073
Let somebody else
worry about it, huh?

1694
01:25:21,111 --> 01:25:23,375
Hey! Jingle bells, jingle bells

1695
01:25:23,414 --> 01:25:24,881
Jingle all the way

1696
01:25:38,829 --> 01:25:40,296
Hello, Kris.

1697
01:25:40,330 --> 01:25:41,797
Fred.

1698
01:25:41,832 --> 01:25:45,791
Kris, I'm afraid
I've got bad news for you.

1699
01:25:45,836 --> 01:25:49,294
I've tried every way to get
some competent authority.

1700
01:25:49,339 --> 01:25:51,603
I've wired the governor,
the mayor. I even...

1701
01:25:51,642 --> 01:25:53,542
This is worth more to me...

1702
01:25:53,577 --> 01:25:55,875
than all the governors
and mayors in the worid.

1703
01:25:55,913 --> 01:25:58,040
It's all over. Look at him.

1704
01:25:58,082 --> 01:25:59,913
He hasn't got a thing.

1705
01:26:16,333 --> 01:26:19,496
And furthermore,
the defense has yet to offer...

1706
01:26:19,536 --> 01:26:22,004
one concrete
piece of evidence...

1707
01:26:22,039 --> 01:26:24,507
to substantiate
this preposterous claim.

1708
01:26:24,541 --> 01:26:27,738
Not one authoritative proof
that this man is Santa Claus.

1709
01:26:27,778 --> 01:26:29,006
In view of these facts...

1710
01:26:29,046 --> 01:26:31,514
and especially since
today is Christmas Eve...

1711
01:26:31,548 --> 01:26:34,244
we're, naturally,
all anxious to get home...

1712
01:26:34,284 --> 01:26:36,252
I ask that you sign
the commitment papers...

1713
01:26:36,286 --> 01:26:37,514
without further delay.

1714
01:26:37,554 --> 01:26:39,749
Mr. Gailey...

1715
01:26:39,790 --> 01:26:42,224
have you anything further
to offer?

1716
01:26:42,259 --> 01:26:43,749
Yes, I have, Your Honor.

1717
01:26:43,794 --> 01:26:46,763
I'd like to submit the following
facts in evidence.

1718
01:26:46,797 --> 01:26:48,628
It concerns
the Post Office Department...

1719
01:26:48,665 --> 01:26:52,123
an official agency
of the United States government.

1720
01:26:52,169 --> 01:26:54,637
"The Post Office Department
was created...

1721
01:26:54,671 --> 01:26:56,639
"by the Second
Continental Congress...

1722
01:26:56,673 --> 01:26:58,140
"on July 26, 1776.

1723
01:26:58,175 --> 01:27:00,939
"The first postmaster general
was Benjamin Franklin.

1724
01:27:00,978 --> 01:27:02,639
"The Post Office...

1725
01:27:02,679 --> 01:27:05,375
"is one of the worid's
largest business concerns.

1726
01:27:05,415 --> 01:27:07,383
"Last year,
under Robert Hannigan...

1727
01:27:07,417 --> 01:27:13,447
"it did a gross business
of $1,112,877,174."

1728
01:27:13,490 --> 01:27:16,459
We're all gratified to know...

1729
01:27:16,493 --> 01:27:18,461
the Post Office
is doing nicely...

1730
01:27:18,495 --> 01:27:21,055
but it hardly has
any bearing on this case.

1731
01:27:21,098 --> 01:27:24,192
It has a great deal, Your Honor,
if I may be allowed to proceed.

1732
01:27:24,234 --> 01:27:26,794
By all means, Mr. Gailey.

1733
01:27:28,272 --> 01:27:31,173
Your Honor, the figures
I have just quoted...

1734
01:27:31,208 --> 01:27:34,234
indicate an efficiently run
organization.

1735
01:27:34,278 --> 01:27:37,406
United States postal laws
and regulations...

1736
01:27:37,447 --> 01:27:40,678
make it a criminal offense
to willfully misdirect mail...

1737
01:27:40,717 --> 01:27:43,413
or intentionally deliver it
to the wrong party.

1738
01:27:43,453 --> 01:27:44,681
Consequently...

1739
01:27:44,721 --> 01:27:46,882
the Department uses
every possible precaution.

1740
01:27:46,924 --> 01:27:52,260
The state of New York
admires the Post Office.

1741
01:27:52,296 --> 01:27:54,594
It is efficient, authoritative,
and prosperous.

1742
01:27:54,631 --> 01:27:57,759
We're happy to concede
Mr. Gailey's claims.

1743
01:27:57,801 --> 01:27:59,132
For the record?

1744
01:27:59,169 --> 01:28:02,036
For the record.
Anything to get this case going.

1745
01:28:02,072 --> 01:28:03,869
Then I want
to introduce this evidence.

1746
01:28:03,907 --> 01:28:06,273
I'll take them, please.

1747
01:28:06,310 --> 01:28:10,406
I have three letters
addressed simply "Santa Claus."

1748
01:28:10,447 --> 01:28:11,880
No other address whatsoever.

1749
01:28:11,915 --> 01:28:15,043
Yet these were just now
delivered to Mr. Kringle...

1750
01:28:15,085 --> 01:28:17,713
by bona fide employees
of the Post Office.

1751
01:28:17,754 --> 01:28:20,052
I offer them
as positive proof that...

1752
01:28:20,090 --> 01:28:23,548
Uh, three letters
are hardly positive proof.

1753
01:28:23,594 --> 01:28:27,325
I understand the Post Office
receives thousands of these.

1754
01:28:27,364 --> 01:28:30,822
I have further exhibits,
but I hesitate to produce them.

1755
01:28:30,867 --> 01:28:32,858
We'll be very happy to see them.

1756
01:28:32,903 --> 01:28:34,837
Yes, yes.
Produce them, Mr. Gailey.

1757
01:28:34,871 --> 01:28:36,964
Put them here on my desk.

1758
01:28:37,007 --> 01:28:39,032
But, Your Honor...

1759
01:28:39,076 --> 01:28:40,976
Put them here on the desk.

1760
01:28:41,011 --> 01:28:42,842
Put them here.

1761
01:28:42,879 --> 01:28:44,870
Yes, Your Honor.

1762
01:29:12,376 --> 01:29:13,843
Your Honor!

1763
01:29:15,846 --> 01:29:17,336
Your Honor!

1764
01:29:27,858 --> 01:29:29,723
Your Honor...

1765
01:29:29,760 --> 01:29:32,820
every one of these letters
is addressed to Santa Claus.

1766
01:29:32,863 --> 01:29:34,831
The Post Office
has delivered them.

1767
01:29:34,865 --> 01:29:36,332
Therefore, the Post Office...

1768
01:29:36,366 --> 01:29:38,561
a branch
of the federal government...

1769
01:29:38,602 --> 01:29:41,093
recognizes this man,
Kris Kringle...

1770
01:29:41,138 --> 01:29:43,470
to be the one-and-only
Santa Claus!

1771
01:29:50,881 --> 01:29:53,197
Since the United States
government...

1772
01:29:53,232 --> 01:29:55,514
declares this man
to be Santa Claus...

1773
01:29:55,552 --> 01:29:57,247
this court will not dispute it.

1774
01:29:57,287 --> 01:29:58,652
Case dismissed.

1775
01:30:10,834 --> 01:30:12,734
I've got to get
that football helmet!

1776
01:30:18,842 --> 01:30:20,833
Thank you so much,
Your Honor...

1777
01:30:20,877 --> 01:30:22,970
and a very merry Christmas
to you.

1778
01:30:23,013 --> 01:30:25,811
Thank you, Mr. Kringle,
and the same to you.

1779
01:30:25,849 --> 01:30:27,339
Thank you.

1780
01:30:38,862 --> 01:30:40,159
Kris.

1781
01:30:40,197 --> 01:30:41,721
I had to wait to tell you.

1782
01:30:41,765 --> 01:30:44,199
I got your note.
It made me very happy.

1783
01:30:44,234 --> 01:30:45,724
Oh, I'm so glad.

1784
01:30:45,769 --> 01:30:47,566
We're having
a big Christmas party...

1785
01:30:47,604 --> 01:30:49,231
at the Brooks' Home
tomorrow morning.

1786
01:30:49,272 --> 01:30:50,739
Breakfast, a beautiful tree.

1787
01:30:50,774 --> 01:30:53,572
I'd like to have you and Susan.

1788
01:30:53,610 --> 01:30:55,237
Oh, thank you.

1789
01:30:55,278 --> 01:30:58,215
There's no one I'd rather
spend Christmas with.

1790
01:30:58,348 --> 01:31:01,283
Would you like
to come to dinner tonight?

1791
01:31:01,318 --> 01:31:03,286
Tonight? Oh, I can't.

1792
01:31:03,320 --> 01:31:04,753
It's Christmas Eve.

1793
01:31:04,788 --> 01:31:06,255
Oh, I forgot.

1794
01:31:06,289 --> 01:31:07,449
Bye.

1795
01:31:32,649 --> 01:31:35,277
Oh, my dear sir...

1796
01:31:35,318 --> 01:31:37,809
you know my assistant Alfred,
Mr. Macy?

1797
01:31:37,854 --> 01:31:39,822
Merry Christmas, Alfred.

1798
01:31:39,856 --> 01:31:41,323
Mr. Macy!

1799
01:31:41,358 --> 01:31:42,825
Hello, Alfred.

1800
01:31:42,859 --> 01:31:44,292
Mr. Macy!

1801
01:31:59,609 --> 01:32:02,077
Kris, all I can say
is the state supreme court...

1802
01:32:02,112 --> 01:32:04,774
declared you
to be Santa Claus...

1803
01:32:04,814 --> 01:32:06,281
and personally
and professionally...

1804
01:32:06,316 --> 01:32:07,613
I agree with them.

1805
01:32:11,121 --> 01:32:13,589
But there are lots
of presents there for you.

1806
01:32:13,623 --> 01:32:15,250
Not the one I wanted.

1807
01:32:15,292 --> 01:32:17,089
Not the one Mr. Kringle
was going to get for me.

1808
01:32:17,127 --> 01:32:18,492
Well, what was that?

1809
01:32:18,528 --> 01:32:20,496
It doesn't matter.
I didn't get it.

1810
01:32:20,530 --> 01:32:23,328
I knew it wouldn't be here...

1811
01:32:23,366 --> 01:32:25,698
but I thought
there'd be a letter.

1812
01:32:25,735 --> 01:32:28,761
I don't suppose
you even want to talk to me.

1813
01:32:28,805 --> 01:32:30,773
Something about a present.

1814
01:32:30,807 --> 01:32:32,775
Yes, I know.
I'm sorry, Suzie.

1815
01:32:32,809 --> 01:32:35,277
I tried my best, but...

1816
01:32:35,312 --> 01:32:38,145
You couldn't get it
because you're not Santa.

1817
01:32:38,181 --> 01:32:41,150
You're just a nice old man
with whiskers...

1818
01:32:41,184 --> 01:32:42,708
like my mother said...

1819
01:32:42,752 --> 01:32:44,982
and I shouldn't have
believed you.

1820
01:32:46,323 --> 01:32:49,383
I was wrong
when I told you that.

1821
01:32:49,426 --> 01:32:52,793
You must believe in Mr. Kringle
and keep right on doing it.

1822
01:32:52,829 --> 01:32:54,228
You must have faith in him.

1823
01:32:54,264 --> 01:32:56,732
But he didn't get me the...

1824
01:32:56,766 --> 01:32:58,700
That doesn't make sense, Mommy.

1825
01:32:58,735 --> 01:33:00,999
Faith is believing in things...

1826
01:33:01,037 --> 01:33:03,164
when common sense
tells you not to.

1827
01:33:03,206 --> 01:33:04,730
Huh?

1828
01:33:04,774 --> 01:33:07,208
Just because things
don't turn out...

1829
01:33:07,243 --> 01:33:09,268
the way you want them to
the first time...

1830
01:33:09,312 --> 01:33:11,746
you've still got to believe
in people.

1831
01:33:11,781 --> 01:33:13,749
I found that out.

1832
01:33:13,783 --> 01:33:15,250
You mean like...

1833
01:33:15,285 --> 01:33:18,686
"If at first you don't succeed,
try, try again"?

1834
01:33:18,722 --> 01:33:19,848
Yes.

1835
01:33:19,889 --> 01:33:21,789
I thought so.

1836
01:33:25,161 --> 01:33:27,129
May I drive you home?

1837
01:33:27,163 --> 01:33:28,289
Thank you.

1838
01:33:28,331 --> 01:33:31,198
If you'll go this way,
you'll miss a lot of traffic.

1839
01:33:31,234 --> 01:33:33,429
You go along Maplewood
until you've come to Ashley...

1840
01:33:33,470 --> 01:33:37,406
I believe. I believe.
It's silly, but I believe.

1841
01:33:37,440 --> 01:33:40,102
Thanks, Kris.
Merry Christmas.

1842
01:33:40,143 --> 01:33:41,371
Merry Christmas to you.

1843
01:33:41,411 --> 01:33:44,244
And to you, my dear,
and many of them.

1844
01:33:44,280 --> 01:33:46,271
Good-bye, my dear.

1845
01:33:46,316 --> 01:33:48,250
Good-bye, Mrs. Walker.

1846
01:33:48,284 --> 01:33:49,751
Good-bye, Alfred.

1847
01:33:49,786 --> 01:33:51,276
Good-bye, Suzie.

1848
01:33:54,824 --> 01:33:57,691
This must be the turn here.

1849
01:33:57,727 --> 01:33:59,695
That's right. Ashley.

1850
01:33:59,729 --> 01:34:02,721
Now you go straight
for four blocks.

1851
01:34:04,000 --> 01:34:07,834
I believe. I believe.

1852
01:34:11,307 --> 01:34:13,639
Stop, Uncle Fred! Stop!

1853
01:34:13,676 --> 01:34:15,644
Stop! Stop!

1854
01:34:19,315 --> 01:34:20,509
Suzie!

1855
01:34:21,518 --> 01:34:22,712
Suzie!

1856
01:34:24,854 --> 01:34:26,481
Suzie, where are you going?

1857
01:34:26,523 --> 01:34:28,047
What is she doing?

1858
01:34:28,091 --> 01:34:30,116
- Suzie!
- Suzie!

1859
01:34:32,362 --> 01:34:34,762
Suzie, where are you?

1860
01:34:34,798 --> 01:34:36,265
I'm upstairs!

1861
01:34:36,299 --> 01:34:38,267
You shouldn't run around
in other people's houses.

1862
01:34:38,301 --> 01:34:39,768
You know better than that.

1863
01:34:39,803 --> 01:34:43,830
But this is my house,
the one I asked Mr. Kringle for.

1864
01:34:43,873 --> 01:34:45,670
It is! I know it is!

1865
01:34:45,708 --> 01:34:48,609
My room upstairs is like
I knew it would be!

1866
01:34:48,645 --> 01:34:49,805
You were right, Mommy.

1867
01:34:49,846 --> 01:34:53,942
Mommy said if things
don't turn out right at first...

1868
01:34:53,983 --> 01:34:56,008
you've still got to believe.

1869
01:34:56,052 --> 01:34:57,986
I kept believing.
You were right, Mommy!

1870
01:34:58,021 --> 01:35:00,421
Mr. Kringle is Santa Claus!

1871
01:35:00,457 --> 01:35:02,220
Where are you going?

1872
01:35:02,258 --> 01:35:03,748
To see if there's a swing!

1873
01:35:05,094 --> 01:35:07,028
There is one! There is one!

1874
01:35:11,768 --> 01:35:13,759
You told her that?

1875
01:35:22,779 --> 01:35:26,408
The sign outside
said it's for sale.

1876
01:35:26,449 --> 01:35:28,178
We can't let her down.

1877
01:35:30,053 --> 01:35:31,987
I never really doubted you.

1878
01:35:32,021 --> 01:35:34,751
It was just
my silly common sense.

1879
01:35:34,791 --> 01:35:37,760
It even makes sense
to believe in me now.

1880
01:35:37,794 --> 01:35:40,262
I must be a pretty good lawyer.

1881
01:35:40,296 --> 01:35:41,763
I take a little old man...

1882
01:35:41,798 --> 01:35:43,766
and legally prove
that he's Santa Claus.

1883
01:35:43,800 --> 01:35:45,290

1884
01:35:55,745 --> 01:35:58,213
Oh, no. It can't be.

1885
01:35:58,248 --> 01:36:00,910
It must have been left
by the people that moved out.

1886
01:36:01,918 --> 01:36:03,078
Maybe.

1887
01:36:04,320 --> 01:36:08,757
Maybe I didn't do such
a wonderful thing after all.
