1
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:26,837
Robbed! Cleaned out!

2
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,878
Nine thousand nine hundred
and sixty-seven dollars.

3
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:31,439
Precisely as I told you
over the telephone.

4
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:35,157
And that girl did it. Marion Holland!

5
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:37,470
That's the girl. Marion Holland!

6
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:41,792
- Can you describe her, Mr Strutt?
- Certainly I can.

7
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:45,589
Five feet five.
A hundred and ten pounds.

8
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:47,999
Size eight dress.

9
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:53,192
Blue eyes. Black, wavy hair.

10
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:56,998
Even features. Good teeth.

11
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:59,151
- (Chuckling)
- What's so damn funny?

12
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:01,834
There 's been a grand larceny
committed on these premises!

13
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,310
Yes, sir. You were saying,
ah, black hair,

14
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:08,790
wavy, even features, good teeth.

15
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:11,554
- She was in your employ 4 months?
- Mmm.

16
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,550
What were her references, sir?

17
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:18,554
Well, as a matter of fact -

18
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:21,280
Yes, uh,
she had references, I 'm sure.

19
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:23,874
Oh, Mr Strutt, don't you remember?

20
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:26,349
She didn't have any references at all.

21
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:30,508
Well, she worked the
copying and adding machines.

22
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:33,148
No confidential duties.

23
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:38,279
(Strutt) Mr Rutland.
I didn't know you were in town.

24
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:41,273
Just had a robbery. Almost $1 0,000.

25
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:44,512
So I gathered. By a pretty girl
with no references.

26
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:48,229
You remember her. I pointed her out to
you last time you were here.

27
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:52,439
You said something about how I was
improving the looks of the place.

28
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:56,309
Oh, that one!
The brunette with the legs.

29
00:03:56,480 --> 00:04:00,075
Excuse me. Mr Rutland's a client.

30
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:03,198
I don't think you've got time
to discuss business today, Mr Strutt,

31
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:05,316
what with your crime wave
on your hands.

32
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:08,995
Oh, no, no. Always time for
Rutland business. You know that.

33
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:11,390
How are things in Philadelphia?

34
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:15,872
The little witch! I'll have her
put away for 20 years!

35
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:18,315
I knew she was too good to be true.

36
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:22,598
Always so eager to work
overtime, never made a mistake.

37
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:25,194
Always pulling her skirt
down over her knees

38
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:28,796
as though they were
a national treasure.

39
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:31,155
She seemed so nice, so efficient.

40
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:34,437
- So -
- Resourceful?

41

Hello, Mrs Maitland.

48
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:17,671
Oh, so nice to have you back,
Miss Edgar.

49
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:20,912
- We put you in your same room.
- Thank you, Mrs Maitland.

50
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:23,111
Can someone drive me over
to Garrod's right away?

51
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:28,149
- Of course. Anytime you're ready.
- Soon as I change.

52
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:46,038
How do, Miss Edgar?
Good to have you back.

53
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:47,599
Hello, Mr Garrod.

Ah, there's my darling!

55
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:52,830
(Garrod) That big spoiled baby
of yours knew something was up.

56
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,877
Tried to bite me twice
already this morning.

57
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:58,476
Forio, if you want
to bite somebody, bite me.

58
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,911
Thanks.

Measles said the nurse.

Oh, it's you. Where's my mother?

68
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:04,433
She's makin' a pecan pie... for me!

69
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:08,350
That figures.

70
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:15,673
(Woman) Who is it, Jessie?

71
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:18,877
- Hello, Mama.
- Well, I just swan. Marnie!

72
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:20,996
If you're not the very limit.

73
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:24,994
I can't take in the way you jump
all over the place like you do.

74
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:29,235
(Mama) Boston, Massachusetts.
Elizabeth, New Jersey.

75
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:32,950
I brought you
some chrysanthemums.

76
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:38,752
Those gladiolas are brand fresh.
Miss Cotton brought 'em last night.

77
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:42,032
I never could stand gladiolas.
I ' ll get rid of these.

78
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:45,431
For land's sake - Marnie,
now watch the dripping.

79
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:48,593
Here, Jessica, why don't you
take these home to your mother?

80
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:50,716
She don't get home from work till 6::00.

81
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:53,838
I'm supposed to stay here till 6::00.

82
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,195
Take them to the kitchen then.
Just get rid of them.

83
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:59,673
Take 'em to the kitchen
before they drip all over.

84
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:04,159
We could stand gladiolas!

85
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:09,272
I send you plenty of money.
You don't have to be a baby-sitter.

86
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:12,955
Whoever said I did have to?
It's my pleasure.

87
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:16,439
That smart little ol' Jessie.

88
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:19,319
Marnie, if you could just hear
some of the things that she says.

89
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:21,550
Oh, but I do.

90
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:23,711
Seems I get a report
in exhaustive detail

91
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:27,190
on all the bright sayings
of ol' Jessie Cotton.

92
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:29,237
What's more, every time I come home,
she's roosting here.

93
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:36,349
I see that you've lighted up
your hair, Marnie.

94
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:40,433
- A little. Why? Don't you like it?
- No.

95
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:45,597
Too-blonde hair always looks like a
woman's tryin' to attract the man.

96
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:48,433
Men and a good name
don't go together.

97
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:53,149
I brought you something, Mama.

98
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:57,840
Now what have you thrown
good money away on?

99
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:00,316
Oh, Marnie.

100
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:03,597
You shouldn't spend all your money
on me like you do.

101
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:06,115
But that's what
money's for: to spend.

102
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:08,748
Like the Bible says,
"Money answereth all things."

103
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:14,511
We don't talk smart about the Bible
in this house, missy!

104
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:23,195
Well, I just swan! How do I wear it?

105
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:26,716
Like this. Real high up under the chin.

106
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:29,156
(Marnie) Oh, it's smart,
it's very, very smart.

107
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:32,949
Goin' around buyin' fur pieces
like they was nothin'.

108
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:35,395
Mr Pemberton gave me another raise.

109
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:40,395
I told Miss Cotton my daughter is
private secretary to a millionaire.

110
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:44,189
He's as generous with her
as if she was his very own daughter.

111
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:47,352
Miss Bernice, don't you want
to get my hair brushed up

112
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:50,557
- before my mommy gets home?
- I sure do, honey.

113
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:52,870
You run up and get the brush.

114
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:56,635
Oh, that kid and her hair.

115
00:11:57,480 --> 00:12:01,439
Puts me in mind of yours
when you was little. The colour.

116
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:05,234
This side of the street
don't get the afternoon sun.

117
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:07,675
My hip and my leg
ache me somethin' awful.

118
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:13,918
(Footsteps)

119
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:18,439
I got the hairbrush!

120
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:22,798
Uh, Marnie, mind my leg.

121
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:43,554
(Mama) I never had time
to take care of Marnie 's hair

122
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:45,676
when she was a little kid like you.

123
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:48,957
- How come?
- Oh, child!

124
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:52,476
Well, after I had my bad accident,

125
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:55,996
first I was sick so long,
and then I had to work.

126
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:59,200
(Jessie) Didn't you all have
a daddy either?

127
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:03,194
No, we didn't. We surely did not!

128
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:05,351
There.

129
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:07,750
As pretty as brushin' can make you.

130
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:12,354
Oh, sugarpop, it's five after 6:00.
You better scat on home.

131
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:16,593
And you be sure to take
your mama those glads.

132
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,753
How ' bout my pie?
How ' bout my pecan pie?

133
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:24,832
I ' ll get it done tonight
and bring it over to you.

134
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,150
Now, Jessie, you mind
you go straight home.

135
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:31,518
OK. Bye, Miss Bernice.
See you later, Miss Bernice.

136
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:36,034
(Door Opens, Closes)

137
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:39,069
Do you really like the scarf, Mama?

138
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:41,470
It's real mink.

139
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:44,074
Oh, there. You look
just like an old man's darling.

140
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:47,310
No man ever give me
anything so good.

141
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:50,278
We don't need men, Mama.

142
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:54,035
We can do very well for ourselves.
You and me.

143
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:57,078
A decent woman
don't have need for any man.

144
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:00,198
Look at you, Marnie.

145
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:02,874
I told Miss Cotton,
look at my girl Marnie.

146
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:07,631
She's too smart to go gettin' herself
mixed up with men... none of 'em!

147
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:12,996
Well, let's go on back to the kitchen.

148
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:16,038
I've got to see to that pie.

149
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:35,995
Uh, Marnie, I've been
thinking seriously

150
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:39,038
about asking Miss Cotton and Jessie
to move in here with me.

151
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:43,919
Miss Cotton is a real nice woman.

152
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:48,232
She's decent. A hard-working woman
with a little girl to raise.

153
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:51,079
Come on, Mama, why don't
you just say what you mean?

154
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:53,356
What you want is for Jessie
to come live with you.

155
00:14:56,760 --> 00:15:00,673
Marnie, you oughtn't let yourself act
jealous of a little ol' kid like that.

156
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:03,991
She don't bother me none.

157
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:06,515
And we could always use
the extra money.

158
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:08,511
The Cottons are mighty decent people.

159
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:16,194
Why don't you love me, Mama?

160
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:20,715
I 've always wondered why you don't.

161
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:25,356
You never give me one part
of the love you give Jessie.

162
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:31,154
Mama -

163
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:33,478
Why do you always
move away from me?

164
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:35,915
Why? What's wrong with me?

165
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:39,629
Nothing! Nothing's wrong with you.

166
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:41,199
No. You don't think that.

167
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:43,555
You've always thought there
was something wrong with me.

168
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:45,512
- Haven't you? Always!
- I never.

169
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:50,668
My God! When I think
of the things I've done

170
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:53,229
to try to make you love me.

171
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:54,958
The things I've done!

172
00:15:56,960 --> 00:16:00,396
Hm. What are you
thinking now, Mama?

173
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:03,279
About the things I've done?

174
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:07,228
What do you think they are?
Things that aren't decent, is that it?

175
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:09,038
Well, you think
I'm Mr Pemberton's girl.

176
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:10,713
Is that why you don't
want me to touch you?

177
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:13,633
Is that how you think I get
the money to set you up?

178
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:24,716
I'm... I'm sorry, Mama.

179
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:27,838
I don't know what got
into me talking like that.

180
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,275
I know you've never really
thought anything bad about me.

181
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:33,079
No, I never.

182
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:35,988
Well, I'm sorry. I really am.

183
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:40,278
- I'll pick up the pecans.
- No, you go upstairs and lay down.

184
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:44,479
You're all wore out. I'll ask Jessie
to come over and pick up the nuts.

185
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:46,949
Alright.

186
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:53,114
After all... it is Jessie's pie, isn't it?

187
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:04,471
(Clunking)

188
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:15,790
No, I don't want to. Mama, no!

189
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:19,790
Marnie, wake up. Marnie?

190
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:22,315
Don't make me move, Mama.
It's too cold.

191
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:24,596
Wake up, Marnie.
You're still dreaming.

192
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:29,555
- Get washed up. Supper's ready.
- Oh.

193
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:33,318
I was having that old dream again.

194
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:37,314
- First the tapping and then -
- I said supper's ready.

195
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:42,235
It's always when
you come to the door.

196
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:44,277
That's when the cold starts.

197
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:16,873
- Miss Clabon.
- Good morning.

198
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:18,519
Is Mr Ward in his office?

199
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:21,274
Yes. He's interviewing for
the new office assistant.

200
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:24,236
Rutland and Company is
an old established publishing -

201
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:28,439
- Oh, Mr Rutland.
- This is Miss Blakely, Mr Rutland.

202
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:32,353
Well done. You'll hear from us,
Miss Blakely, I'm sure.

203
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:34,829
Thank you for your time, Mr Ward.
Good day, Mr Rutland.

204
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,275
Good day, Miss Blakely.

205
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:41,513
Well, I guess that does it. She seems
to have the exact qualifications -

206
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:46,119
Come in for a moment, please.

207
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:59,633
Now, sit down, Mrs... Taylor.

208
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:01,791
Thank you.

209
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:04,913
(Ward) I have here your
Pittsburgh references.

210
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:08,595
Reference, that is. Kendall's, yes.

211
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:10,512
This the only reference
you have to show us?

212
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:14,673
Well, Mr Ward, I have good training,
but I've had very little actual experience.

213
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:16,637
Kendall ' s was my first real job.

214
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:20,395
After I finished school, I was married.
My husband was a CPA.

215
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:22,437
He helped me keep up
with my training.

216
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:25,637
I learned a great deal more from him:
accounting, cost-price,

217
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:28,633
- even something about computers.
- (Ward) I see.

218
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:32,429
When my husband died
very suddenly last November,

219
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:35,717
he left me a little money,
but I felt I needed work.

220
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:38,030
Good, hard, demanding work.

221
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:41,589
I got the job at Kendall's,
but it was -

222
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:43,239
Well, it wasn't a
very exacting position,

223
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:47,154
and there didn't seem much chance
for anything else at Kendall's.

224
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:50,118
I don't mean pay. Salary isn't the most
important thing with me,

225
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:52,919
but more interesting work, Mr Ward.

226
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:56,436
Something that
will keep me busy, occupied.

227
00:20:57,280 --> 00:21:00,158
I don't care how much work
I'm given or what hours I work.

228
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:03,471
(Ward) Uh, Mrs Taylor,
why did you leave Pittsburgh?

229
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:05,835
After my husband died, I just -

230
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,753
(Ward) Mrs Taylor, this is a post
of some confidence.

231
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:12,629
(Marnie) Oh, please, let me have
a chance to prove myself, Mr Ward.

232
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:21,674
Uh... very well, Mrs Taylor.

233
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:25,551
I suppose you might as well
report to work on Monday.

234
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:31,914
Miss Clabon in the
outer office will brief you.

235
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:36,597
I'll be out in just a moment.

236
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:40,116
Taking her on without references?
You' re always such a stickler -

237
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:43,909
Let's just say I'm an interested
spectator in the passing parade.

238
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:45,957
I don't get it.

239
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:48,395
You're not supposed to get it.

240
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:53,591
Hi, Miss Clabon.

241
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:55,955
Hello, Mr Sam.
How's the curmudgeon business?

242
00:21:56,120 --> 00:21:58,350
Oh, Miss Mainwaring!

243
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:02,829
Is Mark in? I want a free lunch,
and somebody to cash a check.

244
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,275
I thought I'd stick Mark
for the lunch and you for the cash.

245
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:07,396
Go right on in.

246
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:10,431
(Ward) You have your
Social Security card, Mrs Taylor?

247
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:14,513
- Of course. Right here in my purse.
- Who 's the dish?

248
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:19,716
Miss Clabon will show you around.
She's been with us for seven years.

249
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:23,714
I believe she finds the work
exacting enough. Good day, Mrs Taylor.

250
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:26,314
Miss Clabon, will you call personnel
and have them send the forms up?

251
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:28,835
Certainly, Mr Ward.

252
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:36,795
(Miss Clabon) Hello.
This is Mr Ward's office.

253
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:40,669
Would you send up a W-4
and the rest of the employment forms?

254
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:42,910
Yes, before lunch. I'll wait.

255
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:45,196
Thank you.

256
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:49,148
Maud, what about Saturday?

257
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:51,914
No, I only thought as you said
your mother wasn 't coming with us,

258
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:54,355
I just wanted to make sure
about our reservations.

259
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:58,199
Well, why don 't you call me back?

260
00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:01,198
Alright. Anytime.

261
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:09,829
Thanks, Mr Sam, I ' ll try not
to do anything sensible with it.

262
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:14,436
- Bye, Miss Clabon.
- Bye.

263
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:17,910
That's Lil Mainwaring,
Mr Rutland's sister-in-law.

264
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:20,918
- Her sister was Mr Rutland's wife.
- Was?

265
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:23,674
She died about a year and a half ago.
Some kind of heart thing.

266
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:26,350
Imagine. Only 29.

267
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:28,954
Well, anyway,
she kind of brought Lil up.

268
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:31,715
Lil lived with them
and old Mr Rutland down at Wykwyn.

269
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:36,473
I get the feeling little ol' Lil
plans to stay on... permanently.

270
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:38,990
Anyway, like I was saying,
old Mr Rutland - that's Mark's father -

271
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:41,549
they say he's never
even been inside this place.

272
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:44,757
The company was headed into
the ground when Mark took over.

273
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:49,436
They say the first week
he was here he retired... ha, retired,

274
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:53,036
three board members, the acting
president, the president's secretary.

275
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:57,033
Coffee time, ladies.

276
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:04,549
- Do you mind bringing me a cup?
- Just coffee? Donut, Danish?

277
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:08,554
- Lady, have I got for you a Danish!
- No, just coffee.

278
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:11,632
- Oh, I'm out of red ink.
- Oh, here, use mine.

279
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:14,758
- I'll get it.
- No, no, I will.

280
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:19,039
Thanks.

281
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:41,597
Mrs Taylor, are you hurt?

282
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:44,149
(Mark) Mrs Taylor!

283
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:46,438
I think she's hurt. Find out!

284
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:50,195
Mary, are you alright?

285
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:52,718
What?

286
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:55,474
Of course, I'm alright. I just
spilled a little ink on my blouse.

287
00:25:55,640 --> 00:25:58,552
The way you rushed out of the office -
Mr Rutland's standing out there.

288
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:00,915
- He said he thought you were hurt.
- Well, I'm not.

289
00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:04,595
All that happened was I spilled
a little ink on my blouse.

290
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:07,479
Good heavens! What a lot
of excitement over nothing.

291
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:35,432
(Phone Ringing)

292
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:41,393
Why in the world does he keep locking
and unlocking that drawer?

293
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:43,630
He never can remember
the safe combination.

294
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:45,119
It's locked in that drawer.

295
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:47,555
Mr Rutland and I have keys too,
for emergencies.

296
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:50,791
It's only five numbers,
for Pete's sake.

297
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:57,315
Mrs Taylor? I've just had a call from
Mr Rutland, Mrs Taylor.

298
00:26:58,520 --> 00:27:01,512
He remembered your saying
you'd be willing to work overtime.

299
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:04,430
He wondered if you'd be prepared
to work on Saturday?

300
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:08,434
- Saturday? Of course. What time?
- Two-thirty.

301
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:11,114
I ' ll advise Mr Rutland
that you are available.

302
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:41,434
(Thunderclaps)

303
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:03,518
- (Knocking)
- (Mark) Come in, Mrs Taylor.

304
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:07,519
Good afternoon, Mr Rutland.

305
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:15,915
Are you interested in
pre-Columbian art, Mrs Taylor?

306
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:19,398
Those were collected
by my wife. She's dead.

307
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:21,152
The only things of hers I 've kept.

308
00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:26,195
And that's Sophie. She 's a jaguarundi.

309
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:30,035
South American. I, uh... trained her.

310
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:32,156
Oh? What did you train her to do?

311
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:34,154
To trust me.

312
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:35,999
Is that all?

313
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:38,635
That's a great deal...
for a jaguarundi.

314
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:41,359
Shall we get to work?

315
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,956
You can use the typewriter over there.

316
00:28:44,120 --> 00:28:46,395
I want an original
and one copy of this.

317
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:48,391
If you can't decipher
any of this, speak up.

318
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:51,358
I typed it myself and
I'm a very creative typist.

319
00:28:57,960 --> 00:29:01,350
"Arboreal Predators
of the Brazilian Rain Forest."

320
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:04,273
Before I was drafted
into Rutland's, Mrs Taylor,

321
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:06,112
I had notions of being a zoologist.

322
00:29:06,280 --> 00:29:09,590
- I still try to keep up with my field.
- Zoos?

323
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:12,239
Instinctual behaviour.

324
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:15,836
Oh. Does zoology include people,
Mr Rutland?

325
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:19,233
Well, in a way. It includes all
the animal ancestors

326
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:21,118
from whom man derived his instincts.

327
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:23,512
Ladies' instincts too?

328
00:29:24,520 --> 00:29:26,875
That paper deals with
the instincts of predators.

329
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:29,349
What you might call the criminal class
of the animal world.

330
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:33,790
Lady animals figure
very largely as predators.

331
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:44,958
(Thunderclaps)

332
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:52,512
Put on the overhead light if you like.

333
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:55,069
The switch is by the door.

334
00:29:57,040 --> 00:29:59,235
(Thunderclaps)

335
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:11,311
Why don't you sit down, Mrs Taylor?

336
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:15,553
If the storm worries you that much,
I'll get you something to drink.

337
00:30:17,320 --> 00:30:19,356
Mrs Taylor?

338
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:33,277
The building is grounded, Mrs Taylor.

339
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:38,998
You' re quite safe here...

340
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:41,313
from the lightning.

341
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:48,271
The colours! Stop the colours!

342
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:50,829
What colours?

343
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:30,235
It's over. All over. You're alright.

344
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:34,758
OK now? Would you like something
to drink? Some brandy?

345
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:39,198
- No, thank you. I'm awfully sorry.
- Oh, don't be silly.

346
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:43,114
- Why do colours bother you?
- Colours?

347
00:31:43,280 --> 00:31:45,748
You seem to be terrified
of some colours.

348
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:50,391
No, no. What I'm terrified
of is thunder and lightning.

349
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:54,519
I wouldn't have pegged you as a woman
terrified of anything.

350
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:10,116
Well, we've all got to go sometime.

351
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:14,399
Look, this place is wrecked
and you're in no state to work.

352
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:16,710
Suppose I drive you home.
You can do this job some other time.

353
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:19,792
- Thank you. I -
- Go get your things.

354
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:25,239
It's cold and damp here.

355
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:28,597
I must get the maintenance people in.

356
00:32:45,280 --> 00:32:49,273
- I'm really sorry about the cabinet.
- Why should you be?

357
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:51,954
You said it was all
you had left of your wife.

358
00:32:52,120 --> 00:32:55,237
I said it was all I had left
that had belonged to my wife.

359
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:57,356
Oh.

360
00:32:58,760 --> 00:33:01,115
(Car Radio) "Native Winkler is second.
Hopeless is third."

361
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:03,999
Oh, no please. I'd like to hear.

362
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:06,230
- You like racing?
- I like horses.

363
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:08,550
I go to the races when I can.

364
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:12,759
- Was your husband a track fan?
- Yes.

365
00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:15,912
- And you go alone now?
- Yes.

366
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:19,637
Atlantic City track's open
till the end of the month.

367
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:22,917
We could drive out there next Saturday.

368
00:33:23,080 --> 00:33:24,672
Alright.

369
00:33:24,840 --> 00:33:27,798
- Are you fond of horses?
- No, not at all.

370
00:33:30,520 --> 00:33:32,511
(PA Announcer) "Fast Return
moving up on the outside. "

371
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:37,793
(Announcer Continues)

372
00:33:54,280 --> 00:33:56,510
Well, that's another one.

373
00:33:57,760 --> 00:33:59,159
Oh, I like it here like this.

374
00:33:59,320 --> 00:34:03,552
You' re the expert.
What do you like in the next race?

375
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:06,188
Lemon Pudding. He's finished third
his last three times out.

376
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:09,397
- Got a good jockey up today.
- Lemon Pudding it is.

377
00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:14,156
The morning line says he's four to one.
I'll get on him.

378
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:20,159
(Man) Pardon me.

379
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:22,550
But you're Peggy Nicholson, aren't you?

380
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:24,519
Remember me?

381
00:34:25,640 --> 00:34:27,358
I'm sorry. What did you say?

382
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:31,513
- Aren't you Peggy Nicholson?
- No, I'm not.

383
00:34:31,680 --> 00:34:35,434
Yeah? I was pretty sure you were.
When I first saw you down here -

384
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:38,751
I'm sorry, you've made a mistake.
I am not Miss Nichols.

385
00:34:38,920 --> 00:34:41,036
- Nicholson.
- Nicholson.

386
00:34:41,680 --> 00:34:44,638
Frank Abernathy introduced us
a couple of years ago in Detroit.

387
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:49,198
Frank Abernathy.
You remember Frank.

388
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:51,749
No, I do not know anyone
named Frank Abernathy.

389
00:34:51,920 --> 00:34:55,515
I have never known anyone
named Frank Abernathy.

390
00:34:55,680 --> 00:34:58,069
- Now, will you please go?
- Aw, come on now, honey.

391
00:34:58,240 --> 00:35:00,390
You're trying to pull my leg,
aren't you?

392
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:02,835
(Mark) Now, why should any young lady
want to pull your leg?

393
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:06,677
Oh, sorry. I thought
I recognised this lady.

394
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:08,398
- Did he recognise you?
- No.

395
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:12,269
- You did not recognise her.
- I said I thought I recognised her.

396
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:15,159
- I said I'm sorry.
- Good for you. You've apologised.

397
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:17,709
You may go now.

398
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:25,236
- You came back so quickly.
- Yes. Who's your fan?

399
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:27,630
I just seem to have one of those faces.

400
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:30,032
Well, what do you like
in the next race?

401
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:32,839
Can we go to the paddock?
I'd like to see Telepathy.

402
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:36,879
Been watching him ever since I saw him
work out once as a two-year-old.

403
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:02,718
Oh, I believe that's
our old friend Telepathy.

404
00:36:03,120 --> 00:36:05,350
Yeah, number eight. Telepathy.

405
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:16,115
He 's a lanky-looking piece of business,
but I bow to your superior knowledge.

406
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:19,317
- What is it? What ' s the matter?
- Don't bet him.

407
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:22,119
- Why not?
- He's walleyed.

408
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:25,033
Can we go now?

409
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:40,188
What a paragon you are.
You don't smoke, drink or gamble.

410
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:42,711
Just this once... for luck.

411
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:45,599
- I don't believe in luck.
- What do you believe in?

412
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:47,919
Nothing.

413
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:51,356
Oh, horses, maybe.
At least they're beautiful,

414
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:53,795
and nothing in this world like people.

415
00:36:54,760 --> 00:36:56,830
Oh, yes, people. A thoroughly bad lot.

416
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,479
Generally.

417
00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:00,710
Did you have a tough childhood,
Mrs Taylor?

418
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:02,199
Not particularly

419
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:07,398
I think you did. I think you've had
a hard, tough climb.

420
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:09,790
But you're a smart girl, aren't you?

421
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:12,349
The careful grammar,
the quiet good manners.

422
00:37:12,520 --> 00:37:15,830
- Where did you learn them?
- From my betters.

423
00:37:16,840 --> 00:37:19,308
What about your tough childhood,
Mr Rutland?

424
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:22,517
The old, sad story.
Promising youth blighted.

425
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:26,355
Dragged down by money,
position, noblesse oblige.

426
00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:30,392
By the time I came along,
the company was hanging on the ropes.

427
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:33,518
We had about 1,000 employees who were
about to go down for the count.

428
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:34,999
What about the Rutlands?

429
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:37,071
What would've happened to your family?

430
00:37:37,240 --> 00:37:39,470
Nothing ever happens to a family that
traditionally marries

431
00:37:39,640 --> 00:37:41,631
at least one heiress
every other generation.

432
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:43,119
(Crowd Cheering)

433
00:37:44,840 --> 00:37:49,914
You shouldn't've chickened. Your
walleyed reject just won by 4 lengths.

434
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:54,630
I think I've had enough. Can we go?

435
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:56,119
If you like.

436
00:37:56,280 --> 00:37:58,111
The track's open
till the end of the month.

437
00:37:58,280 --> 00:38:01,078
That gives us two more Saturdays.

438
00:38:01,240 --> 00:38:05,916
If your luck holds out, by this time
next month, I'll be a rich man.

439
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:17,793
- Oh, Miss Nicholson.
- You really are pressing your luck.

440
00:38:25,880 --> 00:38:27,313
Where are we going this time?

441
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:30,790
I thought it was time I brought you
home to meet my old man.

442
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:33,918
- You should've told me.
- You're alright.

443
00:38:34,080 --> 00:38:37,675
Dad goes by scent. If you smell
anything like a horse, you're in.

444
00:38:55,160 --> 00:38:58,630
Here we are, old bean. The homestead.

445
00:39:12,040 --> 00:39:14,713
- Hello, Dad.
- Who's this?

446
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:16,757
This is Mary Taylor.
Mary, this is my father.

447
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:18,990
- How do you do, Mr Rutland?
- A girl, is it?

448
00:39:19,160 --> 00:39:22,470
It's alright, Dad. She's not really
a girl, she's a horse-fancier.

449
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:25,234
The track's closed. I thought if
I brought her to see your horses,

450
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:28,233
- I'd hold her attention a bit longer.
- Splendid, splendid!

451
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:32,439
Come along, my dear.
I was just about to have a cup of tea.

452
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:40,754
Oh, Mary, this is my
sister-in-law, Lil Mainwaring.

453
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:42,672
- Mary Taylor.
- How do you do?

454
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:45,071
Hi. I've seen you
at Rutland's, haven't I?

455
00:39:45,240 --> 00:39:49,552
(Rutland) It bewilders me what any
of you can find to do at Rutland's.

456
00:39:52,040 --> 00:39:55,669
Oh, dear! I think I rather sprained
my wrist this afternoon.

457
00:39:56,040 --> 00:40:00,830
There 's sure to be droppage
and spillage. Would you mind awfully?

458
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:05,909
(Rutland) Strong, please.
No milk, two lumps of sugar.

459
00:40:06,080 --> 00:40:08,435
The meals in this house
are shocking bad,

460
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:11,114
but I do insist on good
Horn and Hardart cake at tea.

461
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:14,431
You take yours with lemon,
don't you, Lil?

462
00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:16,955
Yes, lemon for Lil, Mary.

463
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:20,471
Strong with a dash of rum for me.

464
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:23,996
(Rutland) Spinster's tea.
Mucking up tea with strong drink.

465
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:27,709
- Something sneaky about it, eh?
- What's your opinion, Miss Taylor?

466
00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:30,189
Do you think old Mark here
is a sneaky one?

467
00:40:31,120 --> 00:40:33,350
Possibly.

468
00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:36,876
How do you take your tea, Miss Taylor?

469
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:39,190
Usually with a cup
of hot water and a tea bag.

470
00:40:39,360 --> 00:40:41,669
(Rutland) Lazy habit, my dear.

471
00:40:41,840 --> 00:40:44,308
I'll have quite a large slice
of that butter cake, please.

472
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:47,074
- Do you ride, Miss Taylor?
- A little.

473
00:40:47,240 --> 00:40:49,470
Best thing in the world
for the inside of a man or woman

474
00:40:49,640 --> 00:40:51,676
is the outside of a horse.

475
00:40:51,840 --> 00:40:53,751
I shouldn't think you'd find
old Mark very interesting.

476
00:40:54,280 --> 00:40:55,998
- Doesn't hunt. Doesn't even ride!
- Please, Dad!

477
00:40:56,160 --> 00:40:58,276
I was hoping to lead up
gently to all that.

478
00:40:58,440 --> 00:41:00,954
I'd even planned to show her
the horses first.

479
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:03,830
Swill that down or bring it
with you to the stables.

480
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,833
Mark's trying to act as if he brought
Miss Taylor out to see the horses.

481
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:10,197
- He really brought her to see me.
- Really? Whatever for?

482
00:41:10,360 --> 00:41:12,715
Showing off. I'm quite
a presentable old party, you know.

483
00:41:13,360 --> 00:41:15,510
Lil, I 'm sure your sturdy young wrist

484
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:18,877
has recovered sufficiently
to pour Dad another cup of tea.

485
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:21,156
- I will have another cup.
- I can't!

486
00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:23,754
"When duty whispers low, thou must."

487
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:27,310
"Then youth replies, I can."

488
00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:31,109
Ratfink! And you misquoted!

489
00:41:57,240 --> 00:41:59,470
Will you come up and spend
next weekend with us?

490
00:41:59,640 --> 00:42:03,997
You can bring your tea bag,
have your pick of the horses.

491
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:11,398
Good night, Mary. I have to run.
See you on Monday.

492
00:42:11,560 --> 00:42:13,596
Good night, Susan.

493
00:42:16,520 --> 00:42:19,159
(Woman) Good night. See you on Monday.

494
00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:39,552
I haven't got my powder puff.
Have you got one?

495
00:42:40,320 --> 00:42:42,880
- Come on.
- Wait a minute.

496
00:42:44,040 --> 00:42:46,474
- Come on.
- Alright, I'm coming.

497
00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:49,632
You mean we have to hang around
and wait until he calls?

498
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:52,519
- Good night, girls.
- Good night. I'll see you.

499
00:42:52,680 --> 00:42:54,272
- Have a good weekend.
- Yeah.

500
00:42:54,440 --> 00:42:56,795
I think that's terrible.

501
00:42:56,960 --> 00:42:59,110
- What are you gonna do?
- I don 't know. Let's get home.

502
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:00,599
He may have already called you.

503
00:43:00,760 --> 00:43:02,591
If I miss his call,
that's the way it goes.

504
00:43:02,760 --> 00:43:04,910
This is the best one you 've had!

505
00:43:05,080 --> 00:43:06,638
(Door Closes)

506
00:43:19,840 --> 00:43:21,751
(Indistinct Chatting)

507
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:28,877
(Clunking Noise)

508
00:46:39,160 --> 00:46:42,152
(Door Opens, Closes)

509
00:46:50,680 --> 00:46:52,989
You' re sure makin' time tonight, Rita.
What's the big rush?

510
00:46:53,160 --> 00:46:56,436
I wanna get to bed.
That's the big rush.

511
00:47:28,920 --> 00:47:31,150
Please get down.

512
00:47:31,320 --> 00:47:34,517
You'll walk back to the stables.
I'll ride.

513
00:47:35,520 --> 00:47:38,990
Are you stayin' at an inn or have you
friends among the local gentry?

514
00:47:39,160 --> 00:47:42,072
- You said you didn't trust horses.
- I don't, but they trust me.

515
00:47:42,240 --> 00:47:45,755
Which brings us directly to our
relationship, Miss Edgar!

516
00:47:55,960 --> 00:47:59,873
Is Edgar your real name?
And you're blonde.

517
00:48:00,040 --> 00:48:03,749
You'll save time and make for better
feeling if you tell me the truth.

518
00:48:03,920 --> 00:48:07,549
Is Edgar your real name?
Now, don't crowd me, lady!

519
00:48:07,720 --> 00:48:10,075
I'm fighting a powerful impulse
to beat the hell out of you.

520
00:48:12,360 --> 00:48:13,679
At last we communicate.

521
00:48:14,120 --> 00:48:17,157
Now, for the third and last time,
is Edgar your real name?

522
00:48:17,320 --> 00:48:19,754
And don't bother to lie to me.
I'll check you out in every detail.

523
00:48:19,920 --> 00:48:23,469
- Yes. Margaret Edgar.
- Where are you from?

524
00:48:24,520 --> 00:48:25,873
California.

525
00:48:26,040 --> 00:48:27,598
- Where in California?
- Los Angeles.

526
00:48:27,760 --> 00:48:29,113
Where's the money?

527
00:48:32,480 --> 00:48:34,550
Here! Some of it.

528
00:48:34,720 --> 00:48:36,836
- Where 's the rest?
- Don't worry. It's safe.

529
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:40,913
Safe? At some pari-mutuel window?
Or gone on mother's operation?

530
00:48:41,080 --> 00:48:43,753
Or perhaps you're putting
your kid brother through school?

531
00:48:43,920 --> 00:48:46,354
I don't have a kid brother
or a mother. I don't have anybody.

532
00:48:46,520 --> 00:48:47,839
Not even Mr Taylor?

533
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:50,878
I wouldn't be surprised to hear
the rest of the haul

534
00:48:51,040 --> 00:48:53,315
is with your late husband, Mr Taylor.

535
00:48:53,480 --> 00:48:56,756
Somewhere I expect to find him
happily reincarnated,

536
00:48:56,920 --> 00:48:59,878
the pockets of his good blue burial
suit bulging with Rutland money.

537
00:49:00,040 --> 00:49:02,793
The rest of the money is in
a registered package addressed to me

538
00:49:02,960 --> 00:49:04,552
in a post office box in New York.

539
00:49:04,720 --> 00:49:07,439
You can pick it up there by tomorrow.
Here's the key.

540
00:49:07,600 --> 00:49:10,876
Thank you, Miss Edgar.
Now I'll take the registration receipt.

541
00:49:13,560 --> 00:49:16,950
This receipt and the package are
as good as a signed confession.

542
00:49:17,120 --> 00:49:20,237
You understand that? Alright.
Now, where does Mr Taylor come in?

543
00:49:20,400 --> 00:49:23,233
There's no such person.
I 've never been married.

544
00:49:23,400 --> 00:49:25,436
Mrs Taylor was an old
friend of my mother's.

545
00:49:25,600 --> 00:49:28,672
And when you applied at Rutland's,
the name just came to your mind.

546
00:49:28,840 --> 00:49:32,469
I was trying to get away from my
cousin Jessie. She's no good.

547
00:49:32,640 --> 00:49:36,189
If she found out about the insurance
money, she'd try to get some.

548
00:49:36,360 --> 00:49:37,679
Make trouble for me.

549
00:49:37,840 --> 00:49:41,150
- What insurance money?
- Mrs Taylor's.

550
00:49:41,320 --> 00:49:44,232
- She died.
- Oh, Mrs Taylor died. Pity.

551
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:46,914
Now you're working with
this naughty cousin Jessie.

552
00:49:47,080 --> 00:49:48,433
Nobody's working with me!

553
00:49:48,600 --> 00:49:51,672
You talk as if this was some
regular thing I do... did.

554
00:49:51,840 --> 00:49:53,398
All planned in cold blood.

555
00:49:53,560 --> 00:49:56,120
- And it wasn't?
- No!

556
00:49:56,280 --> 00:49:58,350
You're not from Los Angeles,
Miss Edgar.

557
00:49:58,520 --> 00:50:00,750
Insurance is only pronounced
insurance in the South.

558
00:50:00,920 --> 00:50:03,309
And that's where you're from.
Where? Around here?

559
00:50:03,480 --> 00:50:06,313
You' re a cold-practised,
method-actress of a liar.

560
00:50:06,480 --> 00:50:08,789
- I can't help it.
- It would appear not.

561
00:50:08,960 --> 00:50:12,350
I don't mean that.
I mean, I wasn't born in California.

562
00:50:12,520 --> 00:50:14,397
I was born in Richmond, Virginia.

563
00:50:14,560 --> 00:50:16,551
My father deserted us
when I was a baby.

564
00:50:16,720 --> 00:50:19,917
My mother and I lived
in Richmond until I was seven.

565
00:50:20,080 --> 00:50:24,232
Then we went to California.
Mother worked in aeroplane factories.

566
00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:26,152
That's the truth. I swear it!

567
00:50:26,320 --> 00:50:30,677
My mother died when I was ten.
And Mrs Taylor took care of me.

568
00:50:30,840 --> 00:50:32,910
Come on, get moving.

569
00:50:34,680 --> 00:50:35,999
How did you find me?

570
00:50:36,160 --> 00:50:38,958
You're here to answer
the questions, ol' girl.

571
00:50:39,120 --> 00:50:41,236
How did you get
the combination to Ward's safe?

572
00:50:41,400 --> 00:50:45,678
- I took Susan's key from her purse.
- I see.

573
00:50:45,840 --> 00:50:49,628
Now, suppose you just begin
at the beginning.

574
00:50:49,800 --> 00:50:54,555
It's just like I told you. I was born
in Richmond. We were poor.

575
00:50:54,720 --> 00:50:57,757
We were grindingly poor.

576
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:05,073
- I was so alone after Mother died.
- Well, go on.

577
00:51:05,240 --> 00:51:08,596
You still have my attention.

578
00:51:08,760 --> 00:51:13,550
I just went to school and took care
of Mrs Taylor until she died.

579
00:51:13,720 --> 00:51:18,271
She left me her house
and $5,000 in insurance.

580
00:51:21,160 --> 00:51:26,188
I sold the house. It had a mortgage
so I only got $9,000 cash.

581
00:51:26,960 --> 00:51:30,953
But there I was with $14,000! Me!

582
00:51:31,120 --> 00:51:33,429
I could do exactly
what I wanted to with it.

583
00:51:34,960 --> 00:51:37,155
There isn't much more. I bought Forio.

584
00:51:37,320 --> 00:51:40,312
- Forio?
- My horse at Garrod's.

585
00:51:40,480 --> 00:51:42,755
I had two wonderful years.

586
00:51:42,920 --> 00:51:46,196
Then last November it was all gone
so I had to get a job.

587
00:51:46,360 --> 00:51:48,351
I went to Pittsburgh
and got the job at Kendall's

588
00:51:48,520 --> 00:51:50,511
until I could look around
for something better.

589
00:51:50,680 --> 00:51:52,272
Alright, let's try again.

590
00:51:52,440 --> 00:51:57,434
Let's back up and turn that Mt Everest
of manure into a few facts.

591
00:51:57,600 --> 00:51:59,113
One: Your dates are all wrong.

592
00:51:59,280 --> 00:52:01,874
Previously you were employed
by the firm of Strutt and Company.

593
00:52:02,040 --> 00:52:03,951
I saw you there once.

594
00:52:04,120 --> 00:52:08,033
Mr Strutt is the tax consultant
for Rutland and Company.

595
00:52:08,200 --> 00:52:10,475
He pointed you out to me.
You were a brunette then.

596
00:52:10,640 --> 00:52:14,030
Then some months later,
he pointed out your absence.

597
00:52:14,200 --> 00:52:16,395
You mean, you knew all
about that when you hired me?

598
00:52:16,560 --> 00:52:18,516
No. I wasn't positive.

599
00:52:18,680 --> 00:52:22,514
But I thought it might be interesting
to keep you around.

600
00:52:22,680 --> 00:52:25,911
And all this time you've been trying
to trip me up, trap me!

601
00:52:27,760 --> 00:52:29,557
Um, I 'm not sure any more.

602
00:52:29,720 --> 00:52:32,917
I think I was just... curious at first.

603
00:52:33,080 --> 00:52:37,039
Then things got out of control and...
I liked you.

604
00:52:37,200 --> 00:52:38,633
So I see!

605
00:52:39,800 --> 00:52:41,677
Incidentally, I think
you took a bit of a chance,

606
00:52:41,840 --> 00:52:45,549
knowing that Rutland's
was a client of Strutt's.

607
00:52:45,720 --> 00:52:46,709
I didn't.

608
00:52:46,880 --> 00:52:50,156
My job at Strutt's didn't give me
access to all the clients' names!

609
00:52:51,880 --> 00:52:54,713
Alright. Let's... get on.

610
00:52:54,880 --> 00:52:56,836
We've established that
you're a thief and a liar.

611
00:52:57,320 --> 00:52:58,639
Now, what is the degree?

612
00:52:58,800 --> 00:53:01,712
Are you a compulsive thief?
A pathological liar?

613
00:53:01,880 --> 00:53:04,713
- What difference does it make?
- Some!

614
00:53:05,920 --> 00:53:08,070
It makes some difference... to me.

615
00:53:13,640 --> 00:53:15,631
Have you ever been in jail?

616
00:53:15,800 --> 00:53:17,631
Certainly not.

617
00:53:19,280 --> 00:53:21,919
I know you'll never believe me now,
and it's my own fault.

618
00:53:22,680 --> 00:53:25,114
It's true about Strutt. I did it.

619
00:53:25,280 --> 00:53:29,398
I don't know why.
I just kind of went crazy, I guess, but...

620
00:53:29,560 --> 00:53:32,711
Old Mr Strutt was so -
Oh, I hated him!

621
00:53:33,680 --> 00:53:34,999
Like you hate me?

622
00:53:37,080 --> 00:53:38,399
Oh, no, not you.

623
00:53:47,120 --> 00:53:49,475
Clean up your face.

624
00:53:53,520 --> 00:53:55,238
Come on.

625
00:54:23,720 --> 00:54:26,154
Good afternoon.

626
00:54:34,280 --> 00:54:37,511
- What'll you folks have?
- A frank and a coffee, please.

627
00:54:37,680 --> 00:54:39,272
- Same for me.
- (Waitress) Okey-doke.

628
00:54:41,120 --> 00:54:43,270
Let's get on
with that little discussion.

629
00:54:44,320 --> 00:54:47,630
The chronic use of an alias is not
consistent with your story

630
00:54:47,800 --> 00:54:51,190
of sudden temptation
and unpremeditated impulse.

631
00:54:52,440 --> 00:54:54,670
What if you'd stolen almost $1 0,000?

632
00:54:54,840 --> 00:54:56,319
Wouldn't you change your name?

633
00:54:57,760 --> 00:55:00,228
Oh, what's the use? Why should I even
try to make you understand?

634
00:55:00,400 --> 00:55:02,755
I'm not only trying to understand you,
I'm trying to believe you!

635
00:55:02,920 --> 00:55:05,150
- Why?
- Because, damn it, I want to!

636
00:55:05,320 --> 00:55:08,118
Can you understand that?

637
00:55:08,760 --> 00:55:10,557
Here you are, folks.

638
00:55:11,800 --> 00:55:13,552
Mark?

639
00:55:15,120 --> 00:55:19,033
The reasons for what I did
at Rutland's,

640
00:55:19,200 --> 00:55:22,875
they were so mixed up,
what I wanted to say before.

641
00:55:24,200 --> 00:55:29,752
I needed to get away, can't you see?
Away from Rutland's.

642
00:55:31,080 --> 00:55:33,469
Don't you understand?
Things were - We were -

643
00:55:33,640 --> 00:55:36,359
So we were.
Was that any reason to run away?

644
00:55:36,520 --> 00:55:38,909
Yes. I thought it was time
I got out before I got hurt.

645
00:55:39,080 --> 00:55:41,674
I mean, why try to kid myself?

646
00:55:41,840 --> 00:55:44,274
- Are you called Margaret?
- Marnie.

647
00:55:47,200 --> 00:55:51,671
- Oh, God, Mark, if you let me go -
- I can't let you go, Marnie.

648
00:55:51,840 --> 00:55:55,037
Somebody's got to take care of you
and help you. I can't turn you loose.

649
00:55:55,200 --> 00:55:59,273
If I let you go, I 'm criminally
and morally responsible.

650
00:55:59,760 --> 00:56:01,079
Then what -

651
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:05,913
Marnie. Yeah, that suits you.

652
00:56:07,480 --> 00:56:09,516
Alright, Marnie,
this is how it's gonna be.

653
00:56:10,480 --> 00:56:13,074
I'm driving you back to Philadelphia.

654
00:56:13,240 --> 00:56:15,993
Tonight we'll go to the house.
Tomorrow you'll go to Rutland's.

655
00:56:16,160 --> 00:56:19,516
You' ll see that Susan's key finds
its way back into her purse.

656
00:56:19,680 --> 00:56:21,477
How can I go back to Rutland's?

657
00:56:21,640 --> 00:56:24,632
You' re covered. I replaced the money.

658
00:56:25,520 --> 00:56:27,875
When I called yesterday
and found you'd pulled out,

659
00:56:28,040 --> 00:56:29,837
I knew instantly what had happened.

660
00:56:30,440 --> 00:56:32,908
So I went to Rutland's
and checked Ward's safe.

661
00:56:33,080 --> 00:56:37,437
Figured the loss and replaced it.
Then I set out to find you.

662
00:56:38,280 --> 00:56:41,989
Remember at the races
when you were hot about Telepathy?

663
00:56:43,080 --> 00:56:45,878
You'd said you'd watched him
training as a two-year-old.

664
00:56:46,040 --> 00:56:49,271
That's all I had to go on,
so I looked him up,

665
00:56:49,440 --> 00:56:52,432
and found he'd been bred by
a Colonel Marston of Virginia.

666
00:56:52,840 --> 00:56:57,868
I phoned Marston and asked him
if anyone there had horses for hire.

667
00:56:58,040 --> 00:56:59,553
He gave me the names of three.

668
00:57:00,800 --> 00:57:03,872
Yesterday I drove up to the plains,
checked out the stables. No luck.

669
00:57:04,040 --> 00:57:07,510
But at the last place, the man said
why didn't I try Garrod's

670
00:57:07,680 --> 00:57:10,035
over by Middleburg?

671
00:57:11,200 --> 00:57:12,872
(Waitress) You folks be sure
and come back now.

672
00:57:15,720 --> 00:57:17,597
Why are you taking me
back to Wykwyn?

673
00:57:18,720 --> 00:57:20,438
Because I don't trust you
not to run away.

674
00:57:20,600 --> 00:57:22,750
How can I run away?

675
00:57:22,920 --> 00:57:25,480
You have the receipt,
the post office key,

676
00:57:25,640 --> 00:57:28,359
- my name.
- Margaret Edgar.

677
00:57:28,520 --> 00:57:29,999
You sure that's
all the name you have?

678
00:57:30,160 --> 00:57:32,913
You sure you haven't misplaced an old
husband or two in your travels?

679
00:57:33,080 --> 00:57:35,071
I told you I 've never been married.

680
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:37,399
- Near misses?
- No!

681
00:57:38,240 --> 00:57:40,390
And no lovers, no steadies, no beaus,

682
00:57:40,560 --> 00:57:42,391
no gentlemen callers, nothing!

683
00:57:43,440 --> 00:57:44,919
OK. Eat up.

684
00:57:48,480 --> 00:57:51,597
- Mark, I'd like to go freshen up.
- Uh-uh.

685
00:57:51,760 --> 00:57:54,593
You're fresh enough. Come on.

686
00:58:04,880 --> 00:58:06,438
You know, I can't believe you, Marnie.

687
00:58:06,600 --> 00:58:09,239
There must've been a great
many men interested in you.

688
00:58:09,400 --> 00:58:12,836
I didn't say men weren't interested
in me. I wasn't interested in them.

689
00:58:13,360 --> 00:58:15,271
- Never?
- No!

690
00:58:16,960 --> 00:58:19,076
That is... not until -

691
00:58:20,480 --> 00:58:23,790
- Why me?
- Because you were different, Mark.

692
00:58:25,280 --> 00:58:26,952
It won't wash, Marnie.

693
00:58:27,560 --> 00:58:29,471
But it's true! I really liked you.

694
00:58:31,120 --> 00:58:32,439
Yes, I think you did.

695
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:35,195
But don't try to make it sound
like any more than that.

696
00:58:36,200 --> 00:58:38,316
When we get home,

697
00:58:38,480 --> 00:58:41,597
I'll explain that we had a lover's
quarrel. That you ran away.

698
00:58:41,760 --> 00:58:43,830
That I went after you
and brought you back.

699
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:46,639
That'll please Dad. He admires action.

700
00:58:47,240 --> 00:58:50,516
Then I ' ll explain that we' re gonna be
married before the week is out,

701
00:58:51,040 --> 00:58:52,598
therefore you should stay on at Wykwyn.

702
00:58:52,760 --> 00:58:55,035
That I can't bear to
have you out of my sight.

703
00:58:55,200 --> 00:58:57,350
He also admires wholesome animal lust.

704
00:58:58,760 --> 00:59:01,115
We 'll be married just
as soon as the law allows.

705
00:59:01,280 --> 00:59:04,078
We 'll catch an outbound boat.
Where do you want to go?

706
00:59:04,240 --> 00:59:07,391
- You ever been to the South Seas?
- What are you trying to pull?

707
00:59:08,440 --> 00:59:10,715
I 'm trying to pull... a proposal.

708
00:59:11,240 --> 00:59:12,958
Let's see, how shall I phrase it?

709
00:59:13,680 --> 00:59:16,194
- How ' bout: Will you be mine?
- You're crazy!

710
00:59:16,360 --> 00:59:20,273
- You're out of your mind!
- That's a possibility.

711
00:59:20,440 --> 00:59:22,670
The name. Marnie. Yes, I'll just go on
calling you Marnie.

712
00:59:22,840 --> 00:59:26,435
That's easily explained. Pet name.
But the Taylor.

713
00:59:27,400 --> 00:59:30,358
We'll just have to marry you off
as Mary Taylor. It's perfectly legal.

714
00:59:30,520 --> 00:59:33,751
You can sign yourself Minnie Q Mouse
on a marriage licence,

715
00:59:33,920 --> 00:59:35,319
you're still legally married.

716
00:59:35,480 --> 00:59:37,232
But you know what I am.

717
00:59:37,400 --> 00:59:40,153
I ' m Minnie Q Thief!
I 'm - I 'm a thief and a liar!

718
00:59:40,320 --> 00:59:44,871
It seems to be my misfortune to have
fallen in love with a thief and a liar.

719
00:59:45,720 --> 00:59:47,950
In love?

720
00:59:48,840 --> 00:59:51,195
Oh, Mark, if you love me,
you'll let me go.

721
00:59:52,360 --> 00:59:54,794
Just let me go, Mark, please.

722
00:59:55,280 --> 00:59:57,236
Mark, you don't know me.

723
01:00:00,160 --> 01:00:04,312
Listen to me, Mark. I am not like
other people. I know what I am!

724
01:00:04,480 --> 01:00:05,833
I doubt that you do, Marnie.

725
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:08,912
We'll just have to deal with
whatever it is that you are.

726
01:00:09,720 --> 01:00:11,870
Whatever you are, I love you.

727
01:00:13,320 --> 01:00:15,880
It's horrible, I know.
But I do love you.

728
01:00:16,800 --> 01:00:18,950
You don't love me.

729
01:00:19,120 --> 01:00:21,429
I'm just something you've caught!

730
01:00:21,600 --> 01:00:23,955
You think I'm some kind
of animal you've trapped.

731
01:00:24,520 --> 01:00:25,999
That's right, you are.

732
01:00:26,160 --> 01:00:29,596
And I've caught something
really wild this time, haven't I?

733
01:00:29,760 --> 01:00:32,832
I've tracked you and caught you,
and by God, I'm gonna keep you!

734
01:00:33,400 --> 01:00:34,879
Oh, and, Marnie, when we get home,

735
01:00:35,040 --> 01:00:37,918
no cute ideas about absconding
with the Wykwyn silver.

736
01:00:38,400 --> 01:00:40,118
Just get a grip on yourself
for one short week

737
01:00:40,280 --> 01:00:42,589
and after that
you can take legal possession.

738
01:00:42,760 --> 01:00:46,275
Like you?
Like you take legal possession?

739
01:00:47,880 --> 01:00:49,199
Yes, if you want to put it that way.

740
01:00:50,200 --> 01:00:52,794
Somebody's gotta take on the
responsibility for you, Marnie.

741
01:00:53,400 --> 01:00:56,597
And it narrows down to a choice of
me or the police, ol' girl.

742
01:01:11,800 --> 01:01:14,234
- Indispensable.
- (Rutland Chuckling)

743
01:01:14,400 --> 01:01:17,233
Ah, Cousin Bob, I almost forgot.
Do you have the old necessary?

744
01:01:17,400 --> 01:01:18,594
Have fun, my dear.

745
01:01:18,680 --> 01:01:20,477
Traveller's checks in this.
Letter of credit in this.

746
01:01:20,640 --> 01:01:24,792
Thanks, old man. Will you see about
having my car picked up at the airport?

747
01:01:24,960 --> 01:01:27,952
Bob is our banking cousin.
A very handy fellow.

748
01:01:31,360 --> 01:01:33,430
Take care, Lil.

749
01:01:33,600 --> 01:01:35,397
We'll send you a noble savage.

750
01:01:35,560 --> 01:01:37,118
- Goodbye, Dad.
- Bye, Mark.

751
01:01:37,280 --> 01:01:40,078
Thank you, Dr Gillian. Without you
it wouldn't have been legal.

752
01:01:40,240 --> 01:01:42,151
It's been a pleasure.

753
01:01:48,120 --> 01:01:52,033
(Rutland) Let's go finish the champagne
and cake before they spirit it away.

754
01:01:52,320 --> 01:01:55,869
Really splendid cake, you know?
I attended to that myself.

755
01:01:56,040 --> 01:01:57,712
I've made the acquaintance
of one of those

756
01:01:57,880 --> 01:01:59,279
excellent Horn and Hardart executives.

757
01:01:59,440 --> 01:02:02,671
That engagement ring must
have been at least five carats.

758
01:02:03,360 --> 01:02:07,239
Six and a half.
Blue-white. Perfect stone.

759
01:02:07,400 --> 01:02:09,595
His mother left
perfectly good jewellery.

760
01:02:09,760 --> 01:02:11,432
It's just sitting there at the bank.

761
01:02:11,600 --> 01:02:15,229
He wanted her to have something
that had never belonged to anyone else.

762
01:02:15,400 --> 01:02:17,630
But six and a half carats!

763
01:02:18,600 --> 01:02:20,795
And cashing in a bond
to pay for a ring.

764
01:02:20,960 --> 01:02:23,155
But he didn't pay for it.
He charged it.

765
01:02:23,360 --> 01:02:24,839
I helped him pick it out.

766
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:28,549
It cost $42,000... plus tax.

767
01:02:29,240 --> 01:02:31,913
Did you say $42,000?

768
01:02:32,080 --> 01:02:34,753
The man's deranged.

769
01:02:35,160 --> 01:02:37,196
You know what he did to me
last Saturday?

770
01:02:37,360 --> 01:02:41,512
He came out to the club
waving a check for $7,000,

771
01:02:41,680 --> 01:02:44,990
and insisted that I break up
my golf game, go in and open the bank,

772
01:02:45,160 --> 01:02:46,991
and hand over to him $7,000.

773
01:02:47,280 --> 01:02:49,271
Then he drew out -

774
01:02:49,440 --> 01:02:53,558
Well, let ' s just say, enough to pay for
this trip, plus the letter of credit.

775
01:02:53,720 --> 01:02:56,518
He cashed that very nice bond
against my advice,

776
01:02:56,680 --> 01:02:58,671
made me get him the money.

777
01:02:59,120 --> 01:03:01,395
Ten thousand in small bills.
And when I asked him

778
01:03:01,560 --> 01:03:04,279
why he wanted $10,000
in small bills, he said,

779
01:03:04,440 --> 01:03:09,673
"Well, old man, I'm being blackmailed,
and they specified small bills. "

780
01:03:09,840 --> 01:03:12,479
I know that most people
find Mark's humour charming.

781
01:03:12,680 --> 01:03:17,276
I do not. There is nothing charming
about running through -

782
01:03:19,640 --> 01:03:22,029
Including the unpaid bill for a ring,

783
01:03:22,320 --> 01:03:25,869
approximately $70,000 in one week.

784
01:03:26,040 --> 01:03:29,715
A $6,000 or $7,000
South Seas honeymoon,

785
01:03:29,880 --> 01:03:32,838
conservatively speaking,
and a $42,000 ring.

786
01:03:33,480 --> 01:03:35,869
All that money spent to celebrate what?

787
01:03:36,040 --> 01:03:38,474
This meager, furtive little wedding?

788
01:03:39,360 --> 01:03:42,238
He didn't even ask Mother.

789
01:04:30,680 --> 01:04:33,114
"Pay off Strutt."

790
01:04:34,200 --> 01:04:36,077
Strutt.

791
01:05:11,680 --> 01:05:13,352
Booze?

792
01:05:13,800 --> 01:05:15,791
Shall I, uh, fix you a drink?

793
01:05:22,800 --> 01:05:24,074
(Knocking)

794
01:05:24,760 --> 01:05:27,433
Would you like some bourbon
to brush your teeth?

795
01:05:27,600 --> 01:05:28,953
(Marnie) No, thank you.

796
01:05:31,800 --> 01:05:34,837
Contrary to the movies
and the Ladies Home Journal,

797
01:05:35,200 --> 01:05:38,237
the battleground of marriage
is not, I repeat, not,

798
01:05:38,440 --> 01:05:40,431
the... bedroom.

799
01:05:42,760 --> 01:05:44,193
The real field of battle is the bath.

800
01:05:44,360 --> 01:05:46,555
It is in the bath and for the bath,

801
01:05:46,720 --> 01:05:48,631
that the lines are drawn
and no quarter given.

802
01:05:49,520 --> 01:05:52,990
It seems to me, we are getting off
to a dangerously poor start, darling.

803
01:05:53,160 --> 01:05:55,833
You've been in the bathroom
exactly 47 minutes.

804
01:05:59,280 --> 01:06:00,508
You can have the bath now.

805
01:06:00,680 --> 01:06:02,875
Thank you.

806
01:06:04,160 --> 01:06:07,630
You're very sexy
with your face clean.

807
01:06:09,280 --> 01:06:11,191
Marnie, come here.

808
01:06:21,520 --> 01:06:23,670
Sit down.

809
01:06:35,960 --> 01:06:37,951
I... can't! I can't! I can't!

810
01:06:39,160 --> 01:06:40,559
For God's sake, Marnie!

811
01:06:42,680 --> 01:06:46,719
I can't stand it! I'll die!
If you touch me again, I'll die!

812
01:06:49,800 --> 01:06:54,828
I promise I won't touch you. Just
get out of that damn corner, please.

813
01:06:57,400 --> 01:06:59,994
Now, suppose you tell me
what this is all about.

814
01:07:00,160 --> 01:07:01,513
Is it your own little way of saying

815
01:07:01,680 --> 01:07:03,352
you don't find me particularly
attractive?

816
01:07:03,520 --> 01:07:05,954
I told you not to marry me.
I told you!

817
01:07:06,120 --> 01:07:08,111
Oh, God, why couldn't
you have just let me go?

818
01:07:08,480 --> 01:07:09,708
Marnie.

819
01:07:09,920 --> 01:07:13,833
- Don't! Please, don't!
- Let me fix you a drink.

820
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:15,877
- I don't want a drink.
- A brandy -

821
01:07:16,040 --> 01:07:18,156
I don't want it. Just leave me alone!

822
01:07:18,320 --> 01:07:20,629
Not till I find out what's the matter,
and some way to help.

823
01:07:20,800 --> 01:07:24,349
The only way you can help me
is to leave me alone!

824
01:07:24,520 --> 01:07:28,832
Can't you understand? Isn't it clear?
I cannot bear to be handled!

825
01:07:29,880 --> 01:07:32,519
- By anybody? Or just me?
- You. Men.

826
01:07:35,360 --> 01:07:36,554
Really?

827
01:07:37,480 --> 01:07:41,268
You didn't seem to mind
at my office that day, or at the stables.

828
01:07:41,440 --> 01:07:43,476
And all this last week
I've handled you.

829
01:07:43,640 --> 01:07:45,676
I've kissed you many times.

830
01:07:46,360 --> 01:07:49,557
Why didn't you break out into a cold
sweat and back into a corner then?

831
01:07:49,720 --> 01:07:54,555
- I thought I could stand it if I had to.
- I see.

832
01:07:54,720 --> 01:07:56,711
Have you always felt like this?

833
01:07:56,800 --> 01:07:59,553
- Always, yes!
- Why? What happened to you?

834
01:07:59,800 --> 01:08:02,792
Happened? Nothing.
Nothing happened to me.

835
01:08:02,960 --> 01:08:05,190
I just never wanted anybody
to touch me!

836
01:08:06,440 --> 01:08:08,032
You ever tried to talk about it,

837
01:08:08,200 --> 01:08:10,316
to a doctor or somebody
who could help you?

838
01:08:10,480 --> 01:08:12,471
No, why should I?
I didn't want to get married.

839
01:08:13,200 --> 01:08:15,316
It's degrading. It's animal!

840
01:08:15,640 --> 01:08:17,392
Anyway, I was doing alright
the way I was.

841
01:08:17,560 --> 01:08:21,189
I wouldn't say that. If I hadn't caught
you, you'd have gone on stealing.

842
01:08:21,360 --> 01:08:25,399
- No. No I wouldn't
- Yes, you would, again and again.

843
01:08:25,560 --> 01:08:28,677
Eventually, you would've
got caught by somebody.

844
01:08:28,840 --> 01:08:30,637
You're such a tempting little thing.

845
01:08:30,800 --> 01:08:34,475
Some other sexual blackmailer
would've got his hands on you.

846
01:08:34,640 --> 01:08:38,315
The chances of it being someone as
permissive as me are pretty remote.

847
01:08:38,480 --> 01:08:40,869
Sooner or later,
you'd have gone to jail.

848
01:08:41,200 --> 01:08:45,034
Or been cornered in an office by some
old bull of a businessman

849
01:08:45,200 --> 01:08:47,316
who was out to take what he figured
was coming to him.

850
01:08:47,480 --> 01:08:49,357
You'd probably have got him and jail.

851
01:08:49,520 --> 01:08:52,910
So I wouldn't say you were
doing alright, Marnie.

852
01:08:53,080 --> 01:08:56,868
- I'd say you needed help.
- I don't need your help.

853
01:08:58,040 --> 01:09:01,476
I don't think you're capable
of judging what you need.

854
01:09:01,640 --> 01:09:05,997
What you do need, I expect,
is a psychiatrist.

855
01:09:06,560 --> 01:09:07,709
Oh... men!

856
01:09:08,120 --> 01:09:12,318
Say "no thanks to one", and bingo,
you're a candidate for the funny farm.

857
01:09:12,480 --> 01:09:14,789
It would be hilarious
if it weren't pathetic.

858
01:09:16,800 --> 01:09:19,678
Let's try to get some rest, hm?
We'll talk this out tomorrow.

859
01:09:19,840 --> 01:09:22,991
There's nothing to talk out.
I've told you how I feel.

860
01:09:23,160 --> 01:09:26,914
I'll feel the same way tomorrow,
and the day after, and the day after that!

861
01:09:27,600 --> 01:09:31,195
Alright, Marnie. We won't talk about it
until you want to.

862
01:09:31,360 --> 01:09:34,670
But we're gonna be on this damn boat
for many days and nights.

863
01:09:35,440 --> 01:09:38,238
Let's drop this for the present
and try to get through this

864
01:09:38,400 --> 01:09:40,914
bloody honeymoon cruise with
as much grace as possible.

865
01:09:41,080 --> 01:09:44,789
Let's try at least to be...
kind to each other.

866
01:09:45,240 --> 01:09:46,878
Oh. Kind!

867
01:09:47,640 --> 01:09:50,438
Alright, if that's too much,
I'll be kind to you,

868
01:09:50,600 --> 01:09:53,717
- and you'll be polite to me -
- You won't -

869
01:09:56,480 --> 01:09:58,471
I won't.

870
01:10:00,120 --> 01:10:02,111
I give you my word.

871
01:10:04,560 --> 01:10:06,755
Now, let's try to get
some rest, hm? How 'bout it?

872
01:10:07,600 --> 01:10:11,957
You in your bed over there, and me,
light years away in mine here.

873
01:10:13,680 --> 01:10:14,999
Thank you.

874
01:10:16,080 --> 01:10:20,437
I think I'd like to stay out here
for a while, but... thank you.

875
01:10:33,080 --> 01:10:35,753
You're gonna bring a little pazazz
down to the old farm, my dear.

876
01:10:35,920 --> 01:10:39,196
I noticed before we left,
Dad was pulling out his silk shirts.

877
01:10:39,360 --> 01:10:41,715
What do you mean,
what will I do with myself?

878
01:10:41,880 --> 01:10:43,996
I had of course assumed
I would become a society hostess.

879
01:10:44,160 --> 01:10:48,073
In Africa, in Kenya, there's quite
a beautiful flower.

880
01:10:48,240 --> 01:10:51,038
It's coral coloured with
little green-tipped blossoms,

881
01:10:51,200 --> 01:10:53,794
rather like a hyacinth.

882
01:10:53,960 --> 01:10:56,599
If you reach out to touch it,

883
01:10:56,760 --> 01:10:59,832
you'd discover that the flower
was not a flower at all,

884
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:04,676
but a design made up of hundreds
of tiny insects called Fattid bugs.

885
01:11:04,840 --> 01:11:07,035
They escape the eyes of hungry birds

886
01:11:07,200 --> 01:11:09,998
by living and dying
in the shape of a flower.

887
01:11:24,200 --> 01:11:27,749
I'll close the door, if you don't mind.
The light bothers me.

888
01:11:32,040 --> 01:11:34,474
Hm, what's that, dear?
The light? Oh, yes, of course.

889
01:11:34,640 --> 01:11:38,155
You've been an absolute darling
about my sitting up reading so late.

890
01:11:38,360 --> 01:11:40,954
I'm boning up on marine life

891
01:11:41,120 --> 01:11:43,475
since entomology doesn't seem
to be your subject,

892
01:11:43,640 --> 01:11:46,712
and I 'm eager to find a subject,
Marnie, any subject.

893
01:11:47,800 --> 01:11:50,075
Alright. Here's a subject.

894
01:11:50,240 --> 01:11:55,268
How long? How long do we have to stay
on this boat, this trip?

895
01:11:55,440 --> 01:11:57,510
How long before we can go back?

896
01:11:57,680 --> 01:12:00,558
Why, Mrs Rutland!
Can you be suggesting

897
01:12:00,720 --> 01:12:03,393
that these halcyon
honeymoon days and nights,

898
01:12:03,560 --> 01:12:06,711
just the two of us alone
together... should ever end?

899
01:12:14,320 --> 01:12:16,629
If you don't mind,
I'd like to go to bed.

900
01:12:16,840 --> 01:12:19,229
I've told you the light
from the sitting room bothers me.

901
01:12:19,440 --> 01:12:22,352
We certainly can't have anything
bothering you, can we?

902
01:12:22,520 --> 01:12:23,509
(Door Slams)

903
01:12:23,800 --> 01:12:26,792
If you don't want to go
to bed, please get out.

904
01:12:27,960 --> 01:12:29,837
But I do want to go to bed, Marnie.

905
01:12:30,960 --> 01:12:32,393
I very much want to go to bed.

906
01:12:33,320 --> 01:12:35,311
(Screams) No!

907
01:12:36,600 --> 01:12:38,158
(Gasps)

908
01:12:44,640 --> 01:12:46,949
I'm sorry, Marnie.

909
01:14:09,520 --> 01:14:11,954
(Door Closes)

910
01:15:57,680 --> 01:15:59,591
(Coughs)

911
01:16:05,720 --> 01:16:07,517
Why the hell
didn't you jump over the side?

912
01:16:08,520 --> 01:16:12,433
The idea was to kill myself,
not feed the damn fish.

913
01:16:20,440 --> 01:16:21,793
Mark!

914
01:16:22,080 --> 01:16:25,834
Oh, I'm so glad to see you.
Was Fiji grisly?

915
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:29,390
We didn't get to Fiji. We jumped ship
in Honolulu and flew back.

916
01:16:29,560 --> 01:16:33,235
We had to take a cab from the airport.
We're tired and grimy.

917
01:16:33,400 --> 01:16:35,470
Remember when you were six?
You wanted to go to New York.

918
01:16:35,640 --> 01:16:37,517
I warned you then that
travelling was a nasty business.

919
01:16:37,680 --> 01:16:39,830
You poor thing.
You must be exhausted.

920
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:42,389
I think that we'll go after the
first drink and pop up to bed.

921
01:16:42,560 --> 01:16:45,632
The travel lecture will
have to wait for morning.

922
01:16:45,800 --> 01:16:47,950
- Where's the rest of your luggage?
- A t the airport.

923
01:16:48,120 --> 01:16:52,511
I ' ll have breakfast with you in the
morning, dad. See you then, Lil.

924
01:17:01,120 --> 01:17:05,477
Come on, Marnie. It's not exactly
a house of correction, you know.

925
01:17:49,440 --> 01:17:50,555
Look, Marnie,

926
01:17:50,720 --> 01:17:54,679
for the present all we've got is the
facade, and we 've got to live it.

927
01:17:55,520 --> 01:17:58,114
Dad has breakfast downstairs
at 8::30 every morning.

928
01:17:58,280 --> 01:18:01,431
I always join him. So, naturally,
as you want to be with me as -

929
01:18:09,200 --> 01:18:10,599
This is the drill, dear.

930
01:18:10,760 --> 01:18:15,197
Wife follows husband to front door.
Gives and or gets a kiss.

931
01:18:15,360 --> 01:18:18,079
Stands pensively as he drives away.

932
01:18:18,240 --> 01:18:21,152
Oh, a wistful little wave is optional.

933
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:36,037
Mark, are you... going to the office?

934
01:18:36,200 --> 01:18:39,397
On the first day back after our
honeymoon? How indelicate.

935
01:18:39,560 --> 01:18:43,473
No, I'm going down the road
on a little errand. I'll see you later.

936
01:18:43,640 --> 01:18:47,269
Mark, I, um...
I don't have any money.

937
01:18:47,840 --> 01:18:51,799
I'm sorry, Marnie. I'll have Bob
make out an account for you.

938
01:18:52,320 --> 01:18:57,348
It won't be much for a while. You see,
I've had a lot of heavy expenses.

939
01:18:57,920 --> 01:18:59,876
And you might as well know
I 've paid off Strutt.

940
01:19:00,040 --> 01:19:01,792
Anonymously, of course.

941
01:19:02,040 --> 01:19:04,918
- (Marnie) But that's all over!
- So?

942
01:19:05,080 --> 01:19:08,072
(Marnie) So, you've given away $10,000,

943
01:19:08,240 --> 01:19:09,958
so you' re a prize fool!

944
01:19:10,120 --> 01:19:12,998
Possibly, but they don't put
you in jail for being a fool.

945
01:19:13,160 --> 01:19:15,435
I'm not the one the cops are after.
Not yet.

946
01:19:15,600 --> 01:19:18,114
And I don't intend to be.
Not if I can prevent it.

947
01:19:18,280 --> 01:19:21,511
Perhaps you, madam, but not me.

948
01:19:53,120 --> 01:19:55,793
(Phone Dialling)

949
01:20:12,560 --> 01:20:14,551
Hello, Mama?

950
01:20:14,840 --> 01:20:17,513
No, I 'm alright.
I 'm perfectly alright now.

951
01:20:17,720 --> 01:20:21,952
I had a bad case of the flu
and just didn't feel up to writing.

952
01:20:22,120 --> 01:20:25,032
I couldn't. I had laryngitis too.

953
01:20:25,200 --> 01:20:28,715
Yes, I am still a little hoarse.

954
01:20:29,600 --> 01:20:30,874
Look, Mama, I can't talk long.

955
01:20:31,040 --> 01:20:35,955
I just called to tell you that I'm
alright and I'll send some money soon.

956
01:20:36,120 --> 01:20:38,793
No, I can't. I don't know when
I'll get to Baltimore.

957
01:20:38,960 --> 01:20:42,635
But not for a few weeks anyway.
But I'll talk to you soon.

958
01:20:42,800 --> 01:20:48,193
If you need anything, write to me
at the post office box in Philadelphia.

959
01:20:48,360 --> 01:20:50,749
I've got to go now, Mama.

960
01:20:50,920 --> 01:20:53,798
Goodbye. Goodbye, Mama.

961
01:21:06,560 --> 01:21:09,279
(Horn Honking)

962
01:21:33,000 --> 01:21:37,118
Oh, Forio! Oh, beauty!

963
01:22:07,600 --> 01:22:09,795
Well, she said she could ride a little.

964
01:22:11,600 --> 01:22:13,556
- Mark?
- Hm?

965
01:22:13,720 --> 01:22:16,439
Mark, listen. I'm a good fighter
if you need me.

966
01:22:17,760 --> 01:22:20,035
I mean, if you are in
some kind of trouble.

967
01:22:20,200 --> 01:22:23,510
I have absolutely no scruples.
I'd lie to the police or anything.

968
01:22:23,680 --> 01:22:25,511
What on earth are you talking about?

969
01:22:26,320 --> 01:22:29,357
I heard you and Marnie
this morning right out here.

970
01:22:29,520 --> 01:22:32,193
- Heard?
- OK, I eavesdropped.

971
01:22:33,160 --> 01:22:35,879
We should've made you go to college
or come out or something.

972
01:22:36,040 --> 01:22:39,999
- I can see that now.
- Don't patronise me, Mark.

973
01:22:40,080 --> 01:22:43,629
That Mary-Marnie, brown-haired blonde
you married so fast and sneaky

974
01:22:43,720 --> 01:22:45,711
and tried to hustle off
to the South Pacific!

975
01:22:45,880 --> 01:22:50,396
I didn't have to overhear stuff about
your not intending to go to jail too,

976
01:22:50,560 --> 01:22:52,357
to know that
you're in some sort of fix.

977
01:22:53,960 --> 01:22:56,838
- Please, Mark, will you let me help?
- Alright, you can help.

978
01:22:57,000 --> 01:23:01,278
You can help by being nice to Marnie.
She needs a friend.

979
01:23:01,440 --> 01:23:04,352
I always thought that a girl's
best friend was her mother.

980
01:23:06,240 --> 01:23:09,232
Poor old Mark.
Is her mother that ghastly?

981
01:23:09,400 --> 01:23:12,995
When the in-laws are so grim,
you don't invite them to the wedding.

982
01:23:13,160 --> 01:23:16,835
The usual excuse is poor health
or the strain of the trip, you know?

983
01:23:17,000 --> 01:23:19,230
But to claim they're dead,
now, come on!

984
01:23:19,840 --> 01:23:23,276
Alright, Lil, what is it you're up to?
Out with it.

985
01:23:23,440 --> 01:23:27,353
Me? I'm just offering you my services.

986
01:23:27,520 --> 01:23:30,432
Guerrilla fighter, perjurer,
intelligence agent.

987
01:23:30,600 --> 01:23:34,036
- Alright, intelligence agent.
- Baltimore.

988
01:23:34,200 --> 01:23:36,191
There's a mother in Baltimore.

989
01:23:36,360 --> 01:23:37,998
Marnie made
a phone call this morning.

990
01:23:38,160 --> 01:23:40,720
She said she hadn't been able to write
because she 'd had the flu.

991
01:23:41,120 --> 01:23:44,874
She didn 't know when she 'd go to
Baltimore, but she 'd send money.

992
01:23:45,040 --> 01:23:49,033
She said to go on writing to her
at the same post office box.

993
01:23:51,680 --> 01:23:54,717
I listened through the library door.

994
01:23:55,880 --> 01:23:59,555
She's having you on, Lil.
It's some sort of gag.

995
01:23:59,720 --> 01:24:02,029
You've been ratty. She's set out
to teach you some manners.

996
01:24:02,560 --> 01:24:05,279
- You're being had, Lil.
- You can say that again!

997
01:24:05,440 --> 01:24:08,955
But I don't want to say it again.
I don't want to have to say it again.

998
01:24:09,120 --> 01:24:11,111
Alright, Mark.

999
01:24:12,240 --> 01:24:13,832
You seem to be growing up, Lil.

1000
01:24:14,200 --> 01:24:16,953
I expect what we should do
is find you some young man.

1001
01:24:17,120 --> 01:24:20,157
- What's your type?
- I was waiting for you.

1002
01:24:20,880 --> 01:24:22,950
I'm queer for liars.

1003
01:24:23,120 --> 01:24:26,237
Really? Well, what sort
of liar do you fancy?

1004
01:24:26,400 --> 01:24:29,836
We could run an ad. Do you prefer
an indoor liar or an outdoor liar?

1005
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:31,513
Playboy or Field and Stream?

1006
01:24:41,960 --> 01:24:45,589
Anybody home? Hi! Where's Marnie?

1007
01:24:45,960 --> 01:24:49,475
She and Dad are still out riding.
He is taking her over the hunt country.

1008
01:24:49,640 --> 01:24:52,074
Big deal! She's going
to ride with the hunt.

1009
01:24:52,240 --> 01:24:54,390
And Dad's throwing some kind of bash
to introduce her.

1010
01:24:55,520 --> 01:24:59,354
- Has a long-distance call come in?
- No. Not that I know of.

1011
01:24:59,520 --> 01:25:02,239
- (Phone Ringing)
- I'll get it.

1012
01:25:04,400 --> 01:25:06,550
(Mark) Hello. Yes.

1013
01:25:06,720 --> 01:25:08,119
Hold on, I want to take it
on another phone.

1014
01:25:09,600 --> 01:25:11,511
I ' ll take it upstairs.
Hang up as soon as I get it.

1015
01:25:14,600 --> 01:25:18,229
Uh, Lil, you will hang up, won't you?

1016
01:25:39,040 --> 01:25:40,439
OK, Lil.

1017
01:25:40,760 --> 01:25:43,320
Hello? Yes I ' ll talk to him now.

1018
01:25:43,840 --> 01:25:46,877
Hello, Mr Boyle. Found anything
interesting down there?

1019
01:25:47,040 --> 01:25:50,191
Hold on. Let me get a pencil.
OK, ready.

1020
01:25:51,760 --> 01:25:54,957
Bernice Edgar.

1021
01:25:55,120 --> 01:26:01,036
1 1 6 Van Buren Street, Baltimore.

1022
01:26:01,200 --> 01:26:02,599
Yeah, I got that. Go on.

1023
01:26:06,160 --> 01:26:08,196
Wait a minute!

1024
01:26:08,360 --> 01:26:10,396
You say she killed him?

1025
01:26:10,560 --> 01:26:13,279
Well, when was that?

1026
01:26:13,920 --> 01:26:16,480
That means the little girl must've been
about five, is that right?

1027
01:26:16,640 --> 01:26:19,598
Well, what happened to her?
No, not the woman. The child.

1028
01:26:19,760 --> 01:26:21,557
I want to know what happened
to the little girl, the daughter.

1029
01:26:26,040 --> 01:26:28,554
No, no! Stay on there.
Get me anything else you can.

1030
01:26:28,720 --> 01:26:30,870
Look, have photostats made
of all the court records.

1031
01:26:31,040 --> 01:26:33,952
Send them to me immediately.
Yes, to my office. Registered.

1032
01:26:34,120 --> 01:26:36,634
You're doing an
excellent job, Mr Boyle.

1033
01:26:37,320 --> 01:26:39,151
(Lil) Did you have a good ride?

1034
01:26:39,360 --> 01:26:43,148
Yeah. Ah, Mr Boyle,
get the photostats to me. Yes.

1035
01:26:43,320 --> 01:26:46,790
And call me the minute
you get anything further on the child.

1036
01:26:46,960 --> 01:26:49,633
Thank you.
I'll expect to hear from you.

1037
01:26:49,800 --> 01:26:51,836
Goodbye.

1038
01:27:02,760 --> 01:27:05,274
(Tapping)

1039
01:27:05,440 --> 01:27:09,274
- (Tapping Continues)
- Mama? Oh, Mama, don't cry.

1040
01:27:10,200 --> 01:27:11,952
Please don't cry, Mama.

1041
01:27:13,400 --> 01:27:17,109
- (Tapping)
- No! No!

1042
01:27:17,840 --> 01:27:19,831
Mama?

1043
01:27:20,360 --> 01:27:23,033
Mama, don't cry.

1044
01:27:24,080 --> 01:27:26,275
- (Tapping Continues)
- No!

1045
01:27:27,240 --> 01:27:30,630
Mama? Mama?

1046
01:27:32,800 --> 01:27:35,189
- (Knocking At Door)
- Mama?

1047
01:27:35,360 --> 01:27:37,237
- Mama?
- Wake up, Marnie.

1048
01:27:37,480 --> 01:27:38,913
- Mama?
- Marnie?

1049
01:27:40,600 --> 01:27:44,639
Mama? Oh, don't hurt my mama.

1050
01:27:45,560 --> 01:27:49,235
- Marnie.
- Please don't hurt my mama!

1051
01:27:55,120 --> 01:27:58,237
- Marnie.
- (Gasps) Oh, don't, don't!

1052
01:28:00,520 --> 01:28:03,318
- What's going on?
- She's having a nightmare.

1053
01:28:04,080 --> 01:28:07,993
- No, Mama. Mama?
- Marnie, wake up, it's just a nightmare.

1054
01:28:13,080 --> 01:28:16,072
- She's alright.
- I'm cold.

1055
01:28:18,320 --> 01:28:21,312
That's supposed to be your department,
isn't it, ol' boy?

1056
01:28:22,120 --> 01:28:24,236
Good night, all.

1057
01:28:39,640 --> 01:28:42,996
- Let me get you a brandy.
- Uh-uh.

1058
01:28:43,640 --> 01:28:46,234
Where did you get these things?

1059
01:28:47,680 --> 01:28:50,194
I can get more anytime I want them.

1060
01:28:50,360 --> 01:28:53,716
Yeah, of course you can. You can
also find, at your convenience,

1061
01:28:53,880 --> 01:28:56,872
heights, ropes, ovens,
even plastic bags.

1062
01:28:57,040 --> 01:28:59,110
The world's full of alternatives.

1063
01:28:59,760 --> 01:29:02,035
I'd like to go back to sleep now.

1064
01:29:02,200 --> 01:29:06,398
Why? Your sleep seems even less
agreeable than your waking hours.

1065
01:29:07,400 --> 01:29:09,630
That, uh, dream.

1066
01:29:09,800 --> 01:29:13,190
You know, you've had it before.

1067
01:29:13,360 --> 01:29:15,555
Is it about something that
really happened to you?

1068
01:29:15,720 --> 01:29:19,633
No, I... I don't know
what it means. Nothing.

1069
01:29:20,600 --> 01:29:24,149
Well, it's about your mother.
She wants you to get up.

1070
01:29:24,800 --> 01:29:28,076
Yes, but first there
are the three taps.

1071
01:29:29,800 --> 01:29:33,793
And then she says, "Get up, Marnie.
You have to get up now!"

1072
01:29:33,960 --> 01:29:37,032
But I don't want to. If I -

1073
01:29:37,200 --> 01:29:39,953
If I get up, I'll be cold
and they'll hurt her!

1074
01:29:40,680 --> 01:29:43,240
Who? Who'll hurt her?

1075
01:29:43,400 --> 01:29:46,756
Th-Th- Them!

1076
01:29:46,920 --> 01:29:49,195
I don't know! I don't know!

1077
01:29:49,360 --> 01:29:52,113
But I hear the noises.
I'm cold and I hear the noises!

1078
01:29:52,440 --> 01:29:55,193
What noises? What are they like?

1079
01:30:00,520 --> 01:30:02,511
Who makes them?

1080
01:30:09,400 --> 01:30:11,595
You Freud, me Jane?

1081
01:30:15,320 --> 01:30:19,393
If you won't see an analyst,
why don't you try to help yourself?

1082
01:30:20,240 --> 01:30:24,119
But that's why I'm in this trap,
from trying to help myself.

1083
01:30:24,280 --> 01:30:26,316
Just leave me alone, Mark, please.

1084
01:30:26,480 --> 01:30:27,913
If I give you some books,
will you read them?

1085
01:30:29,720 --> 01:30:32,314
Your new homework?
Frigidity In Women?

1086
01:30:32,480 --> 01:30:34,994
The Psychopathic Delinquent
and Criminal?

1087
01:30:35,160 --> 01:30:38,675
- Have you read them?
- I don't need to read that muck

1088
01:30:38,840 --> 01:30:42,913
to know that women are stupid and
feeble and that men are filthy pigs!

1089
01:30:45,880 --> 01:30:50,112
In case you didn't recognise it,
that was a rejection.

1090
01:30:50,280 --> 01:30:53,875
I want you to read them.
Start with The Undiscovered Self.

1091
01:30:54,120 --> 01:30:57,669
Oh, for God's sake, Mark,
leave me alone! I'm tired!

1092
01:30:59,640 --> 01:31:02,108
Why can't you just leave me alone?

1093
01:31:03,600 --> 01:31:05,750
Because I think
you're sick, ol' dear.

1094
01:31:07,440 --> 01:31:09,431
I'm sick?

1095
01:31:10,320 --> 01:31:12,959
Well, take a look
at yourself, ol' dear.

1096
01:31:13,120 --> 01:31:16,635
You're so hot to play
Mental Health Week, what about you?

1097
01:31:16,960 --> 01:31:21,954
Talk about dream worlds. You've got
a pathological fix on a woman,

1098
01:31:22,120 --> 01:31:26,159
who's not only an admitted criminal
but who screams if you come near her!

1099
01:31:29,040 --> 01:31:31,634
So what about your dreams, Daddy dear?

1100
01:31:32,400 --> 01:31:34,152
I never said I was perfect.

1101
01:31:35,680 --> 01:31:38,194
That was quite a speech.
It encourages me to believe

1102
01:31:38,360 --> 01:31:40,555
that you have leafed through
one or two books.

1103
01:31:40,720 --> 01:31:42,836
Which one did you find
the most interesting?

1104
01:31:45,360 --> 01:31:48,113
You're really dying
to play doctor, aren't you?

1105
01:31:50,000 --> 01:31:53,993
OK, I'm a big movie fan.
I know the games.

1106
01:31:54,160 --> 01:31:56,435
Come on. Let's play.

1107
01:31:56,600 --> 01:31:59,433
Shall I start with dreams
or should we free-associate?

1108
01:32:00,800 --> 01:32:04,793
Oh, Doctor, I'll bet you're
just dying to free-associate.

1109
01:32:05,880 --> 01:32:08,758
Alright now, you give me a word
and I ' ll give you an association.

1110
01:32:08,920 --> 01:32:12,993
You know, like: needles, pins;
when a man marries, trouble begins.

1111
01:32:13,160 --> 01:32:15,151
You ready?

1112
01:32:17,080 --> 01:32:20,595
Well, come on! I thought you wanted
to play doctor, so let's play!

1113
01:32:21,880 --> 01:32:25,998
- Water.
- Bath. Soap. Cleanse.

1114
01:32:26,160 --> 01:32:27,991
Pure. Made pure for me.

1115
01:32:28,160 --> 01:32:31,630
"And his tears
shall wash away thy sins

1116
01:32:31,800 --> 01:32:33,518
and make thee over again."

1117
01:32:34,040 --> 01:32:36,759
Baptists. Mother used to take me
to church. Twice on Sundays.

1118
01:32:39,640 --> 01:32:42,279
There. I'm not holding back
at all, am I?

1119
01:32:42,440 --> 01:32:44,749
You're bringing me out
marvellously, Doctor.

1120
01:32:44,920 --> 01:32:48,799
You'll have me up on my poor paralysed
little legs by the next scene. Go on.

1121
01:32:50,240 --> 01:32:53,152
- Air.
- Stare.

1122
01:32:53,320 --> 01:32:55,311
And that's what you do.

1123
01:32:56,960 --> 01:33:00,475
Stare and blare and say you care,
but you're unfair, you want a pair.

1124
01:33:01,560 --> 01:33:04,233
- Sex.
- Masculine, Feminine,

1125
01:33:04,400 --> 01:33:05,674
Adam and Eve, Jack and Jill.

1126
01:33:05,840 --> 01:33:08,513
I'll slap your filthy face
if you come near me again, Jack!

1127
01:33:08,680 --> 01:33:12,832
- Death.
- Me. Oh, listen, Mark -

1128
01:33:13,000 --> 01:33:14,194
- Needles.
- Pins.

1129
01:33:14,360 --> 01:33:15,395
- Black
- White

1130
01:33:15,680 --> 01:33:18,114
- Red!
- White. White!

1131
01:33:18,560 --> 01:33:22,838
It's alright, Marnie.
Darling, come here.

1132
01:33:23,000 --> 01:33:26,197
I won't let anything bad
happen to you. You're alright.

1133
01:33:27,000 --> 01:33:30,151
- You're alright.
- Oh, help me!

1134
01:33:30,960 --> 01:33:34,953
Help me. Oh, God,
somebody help me!

1135
01:33:41,240 --> 01:33:43,549
(Indistinct Chatter, Laughter)

1136
01:33:52,720 --> 01:33:55,109
(Doorbell Rings)

1137
01:34:03,840 --> 01:34:04,989
(Doorbell Rings)

1138
01:34:16,280 --> 01:34:18,748
(Doorbell Rings)

1139
01:34:23,320 --> 01:34:24,469
(Butler) What name, sir?

1140
01:34:24,640 --> 01:34:27,473
- Strutt.
- (Butler) Mr and Mrs Strutt.

1141
01:34:27,640 --> 01:34:30,871
Mr Strutt, Mrs Strutt? How do you do?

1142
01:34:31,040 --> 01:34:32,268
I 'm Lil Mainwaring,
Mark's sister-in-law.

1143
01:34:32,440 --> 01:34:35,159
- So good of you to come all this way.
- So nice of you to ask us.

1144
01:34:35,440 --> 01:34:39,319
Wait till tomorrow, Charlie.
Wait till you see her on a horse, eh?

1145
01:34:41,760 --> 01:34:44,797
- I'm not a bit nervous, Mark.
- You have no reason to be.

1146
01:34:45,120 --> 01:34:49,079
You're unquestionably
the best-looking woman here.

1147
01:34:49,240 --> 01:34:52,073
The best-dressed. The most intelligent.
And you're with me.

1148
01:34:54,400 --> 01:34:56,789
- I think everyone's here.
- Well, Lil's scorekeeper.

1149
01:34:56,960 --> 01:34:59,554
She has the list, made the table
arrangements and everything.

1150
01:34:59,720 --> 01:35:01,950
I'm afraid I wasn't much help,
but I'll do better next time.

1151
01:35:02,120 --> 01:35:04,076
You're doing well enough.

1152
01:35:04,240 --> 01:35:08,631
I suppose we should keep... circulating.

1153
01:35:15,200 --> 01:35:17,191
Why?

1154
01:35:17,440 --> 01:35:20,477
- Why?
- I don't know. I swear I don't know.

1155
01:35:21,160 --> 01:35:24,118
He wasn't invited here.
He's never been invited here.

1156
01:35:24,320 --> 01:35:26,993
- It's Lil!
- Lil?

1157
01:35:27,400 --> 01:35:30,153
- She doesn't even know Strutt.
- It's Lil!

1158
01:35:30,320 --> 01:35:32,788
Get me out of here please.

1159
01:35:32,960 --> 01:35:34,712
It's too late. Here they come.

1160
01:35:34,880 --> 01:35:37,075
Look, call his bluff. I'll back you up.

1161
01:35:37,920 --> 01:35:41,390
- Oh, hello, Strutt. Good to see you.
- Good to see you.

1162
01:35:41,560 --> 01:35:44,233
- We haven't met. I am Mark Rutland.
- How do you do?

1163
01:35:44,400 --> 01:35:46,675
- And this is my wife.
- How do you do?

1164
01:35:47,160 --> 01:35:49,720
Well, this is a surprise.
I hadn't heard about your marriage.

1165
01:35:49,880 --> 01:35:52,792
You know, we all think
a great deal of your husband.

1166
01:35:55,280 --> 01:35:59,478
We've been doing business with
the Rutlands... for a long time.

1167
01:36:04,360 --> 01:36:08,319
- I believe we've met before.
- I don't think so.

1168
01:36:10,840 --> 01:36:14,674
Think again... Mrs Rutland.

1169
01:36:14,840 --> 01:36:16,558
Are you just recently married?

1170
01:36:17,400 --> 01:36:19,470
Marnie and I have been married
for two months.

1171
01:36:19,640 --> 01:36:21,835
But we've known each other
quite well for four years.

1172
01:36:22,000 --> 01:36:24,560
Four years? Before Estelle...

1173
01:36:24,680 --> 01:36:26,079
Yes, didn't you know?

1174
01:36:30,160 --> 01:36:32,355
Darling, Betty seems
rather stranded over there.

1175
01:36:32,520 --> 01:36:35,239
You' ll have to excuse us for a few
moments, Mrs Strutt.

1176
01:36:35,400 --> 01:36:36,958
Oh, and Lil, would you see that

1177
01:36:37,120 --> 01:36:39,350
Mr and Mrs Strutt's glasses
are kept brimming?

1178
01:36:39,520 --> 01:36:40,669
That's a good girl.

1179
01:36:40,840 --> 01:36:43,752
- I'm going to be sick.
- You're not going to be sick.

1180
01:36:43,920 --> 01:36:46,229
You said we'd known each other
four years. Lil thought -

1181
01:36:46,400 --> 01:36:49,437
I don't give one infinitesimal damn
what Lil thought or thinks.

1182
01:36:49,600 --> 01:36:50,999
- Dinner is ready, sir.
- Good. Announce it.

1183
01:36:53,200 --> 01:36:55,156
Dinner is served.

1184
01:36:57,720 --> 01:37:00,951
Mr Strutt, my wife's taken a fancy
to you. Will you see her into dinner?

1185
01:37:12,800 --> 01:37:16,110
Five minutes! I 'm five minutes behind
you, and in those five minutes

1186
01:37:16,280 --> 01:37:18,748
you've got yourself up like a cat
burglar and packed for a world cruise.

1187
01:37:19,240 --> 01:37:20,992
I've got to get out of here,
and you've got to let me go.

1188
01:37:21,160 --> 01:37:23,469
That man is going to send me to jail.
You know he is!

1189
01:37:23,640 --> 01:37:25,517
What are you using
for guts this season?

1190
01:37:25,680 --> 01:37:26,715
Don't you understand?

1191
01:37:26,880 --> 01:37:28,791
He's coming back here tomorrow
and he's coming for my head!

1192
01:37:28,960 --> 01:37:30,951
We just won't give it to him.

1193
01:37:31,040 --> 01:37:33,873
Strutt may be throbbing away
with vengeful fantasies,

1194
01:37:34,040 --> 01:37:37,077
but the fact is he's a businessman,
he's in the business of doing business.

1195
01:37:37,240 --> 01:37:39,310
- So?
- So we try to do business.

1196
01:37:39,480 --> 01:37:41,311
The Rutland account
is one of the biggest he's got.

1197
01:37:41,480 --> 01:37:45,268
If he insists on acting like the swine
he is, then... and he'll lose others too.

1198
01:37:45,440 --> 01:37:48,079
I'll see to it, but first I'll see to
it that he understands I'll see to it.

1199
01:37:48,240 --> 01:37:51,391
You can keep him from prosecuting,
you can't keep him from talking.

1200
01:37:51,560 --> 01:37:54,199
I don't care if he outtalks every
Southern senator on Capitol Hill.

1201
01:37:54,360 --> 01:37:55,509
Well, I do. I care.

1202
01:37:55,680 --> 01:37:58,752
Darling, didn't your mother
ever tell you about sticks and stones?

1203
01:37:58,920 --> 01:38:02,708
Can't you understand there may be
other... things involved,

1204
01:38:02,880 --> 01:38:05,075
other people that I don't
want to hear about me?

1205
01:38:05,240 --> 01:38:06,275
Yes, I can understand,

1206
01:38:06,440 --> 01:38:10,035
but since you're the well-known
orphan child, who's to care?

1207
01:38:10,200 --> 01:38:11,599
The police, damn you.

1208
01:38:11,760 --> 01:38:14,194
What can the police do if we can stop
Strutt from prosecuting?

1209
01:38:14,400 --> 01:38:18,313
They can start investigating
other jobs. Other similar jobs.

1210
01:38:23,880 --> 01:38:25,836
- Well, that's something else again.
- Yes, it is.

1211
01:38:26,320 --> 01:38:28,550
How many? How many other jobs?

1212
01:38:31,560 --> 01:38:34,120
Tell me the truth, damn it! You've
nothing to gain by lying to me now!

1213
01:38:34,280 --> 01:38:36,316
- How many jobs have you pulled?
- Three.

1214
01:38:38,040 --> 01:38:41,749
- Try again.
- Four. Five counting Strutt.

1215
01:38:42,680 --> 01:38:44,477
Over how long a period?

1216
01:38:44,640 --> 01:38:46,631
Five years,
and that's the truth, I swear!

1217
01:38:47,800 --> 01:38:51,554
- Alright. How much? How much?
- Under $50,000.

1218
01:38:52,680 --> 01:38:54,079
What towns?

1219
01:38:54,240 --> 01:38:57,277
Buffalo, Detroit, Elizabeth, New Jersey
and New York.

1220
01:38:57,440 --> 01:38:59,749
Well, in New York and Philadelphia,

1221
01:38:59,920 --> 01:39:02,559
I ' ll be poor old Mark Rutland who lost
his head over a pretty girl.

1222
01:39:02,720 --> 01:39:05,234
In the others I'm just
an accessory after the fact

1223
01:39:05,400 --> 01:39:06,992
and equally liable under the law.

1224
01:39:07,160 --> 01:39:09,833
Well, then let me go! They can't
blame you because you didn't know!

1225
01:39:10,000 --> 01:39:12,912
After you found out, I ran away.
Just let me go!

1226
01:39:13,080 --> 01:39:15,150
If I let you run out now,
nothing could keep the lid on it.

1227
01:39:15,320 --> 01:39:18,517
They've got your real name. They'll
work up a complete dossier on you.

1228
01:39:18,680 --> 01:39:20,079
When they finally catch you,
and they will catch you,

1229
01:39:20,240 --> 01:39:21,912
they'll throw the
New York City Library at you.

1230
01:39:22,720 --> 01:39:25,314
But, suppose we don't lose our heads?

1231
01:39:25,480 --> 01:39:28,995
All we've got to fight is Strutt's
big mouth. That gives us time.

1232
01:39:29,840 --> 01:39:33,037
Sit down. Listen.
We can do one of two things.

1233
01:39:33,200 --> 01:39:36,033
We can hire a lawyer
and a psychiatrist,

1234
01:39:36,200 --> 01:39:39,590
and make an immediate voluntary
confession and an offer of restitution.

1235
01:39:39,760 --> 01:39:40,954
That'll make the whole thing public.

1236
01:39:41,440 --> 01:39:44,910
But the chances are very good
that you' ll get a suspended sentence.

1237
01:39:45,080 --> 01:39:47,150
Now the alternative.

1238
01:39:47,320 --> 01:39:50,198
We can go together and make private
calls on all the places you've robbed.

1239
01:39:50,680 --> 01:39:54,719
You'll express deep sorrow
and repentance,

1240
01:39:54,880 --> 01:39:56,359
sincere and vocal contrition.

1241
01:39:56,640 --> 01:39:59,552
And while you sob, I show a check
for the amount stolen.

1242
01:40:01,120 --> 01:40:02,394
Press it into their hands

1243
01:40:02,560 --> 01:40:05,120
and ask as a special favour
to a distraught husband,

1244
01:40:05,280 --> 01:40:07,589
to withdraw the charge.
But if one of them says,

1245
01:40:07,760 --> 01:40:09,751
"Thanks, I'll take the money,
but I won't drop the charge, "

1246
01:40:09,920 --> 01:40:10,909
then we 've had it.

1247
01:40:11,520 --> 01:40:14,034
After that it's an open court case,
and very probable sentence.

1248
01:40:17,000 --> 01:40:19,878
On the other hand, with a bit of luck
we might pull it off.

1249
01:40:20,040 --> 01:40:21,951
Think it over.

1250
01:40:23,080 --> 01:40:25,389
It's late. You better get some sleep.
You gotta be up for the hunt.

1251
01:40:25,560 --> 01:40:27,915
You don't expect me
to ride in the hunt!

1252
01:40:28,080 --> 01:40:29,559
Certainly I expect you to ride.

1253
01:40:29,720 --> 01:40:32,280
For one thing, I want you out of
the house when Strutt comes here.

1254
01:40:32,720 --> 01:40:34,358
For another, I don't want
to give Lil the satisfaction

1255
01:40:34,520 --> 01:40:35,953
of seeing you chicken.

1256
01:40:36,640 --> 01:40:40,394
And, Marnie,
tonight the door stays open.

1257
01:40:47,280 --> 01:40:48,838
(Dogs Barking)

1258
01:41:28,280 --> 01:41:30,430
(Indistinct Chatter, Laughter)

1259
01:43:03,480 --> 01:43:05,994
(Screams)

1260
01:43:07,280 --> 01:43:09,589
(Whinnies)

1261
01:43:10,480 --> 01:43:12,232
(Screams)

1262
01:43:30,760 --> 01:43:32,830
Forio!

1263
01:43:37,280 --> 01:43:39,271
(Whinnies)

1264
01:43:54,320 --> 01:43:58,154
A gun! Give me a gun!
My horse is screaming!

1265
01:43:58,320 --> 01:44:01,596
- Get me a gun!
- You want to shoot your horse?

1266
01:44:01,760 --> 01:44:03,990
Hey, wait a minute!

1267
01:44:04,160 --> 01:44:08,438
I can't give you a gun, my mister
isn't home. I don't know what he'd -

1268
01:44:08,600 --> 01:44:11,034
You must be crazy!

1269
01:44:11,200 --> 01:44:13,668
Mrs Turpin!

1270
01:44:13,840 --> 01:44:16,479
Miss Mainwaring,
this woman comes tearing in here

1271
01:44:16,640 --> 01:44:17,993
demandin' I give her a gun.

1272
01:44:18,160 --> 01:44:21,391
Tell this fool to give me a gun.
Forio 's hurt!

1273
01:44:21,560 --> 01:44:25,155
Marnie, wait. I ' ll call a vet.
There's nothing a vet can do.

1274
01:44:25,320 --> 01:44:27,470
We don't have a phone
anyway, Miss Mainwaring.

1275
01:44:27,640 --> 01:44:30,871
If the horse is hurt bad,
I could give her Jack's pistol.

1276
01:44:31,040 --> 01:44:33,235
Hurry. Oh, hurry, please.
He's suffering.

1277
01:44:33,400 --> 01:44:35,231
Go get the gun!

1278
01:44:35,400 --> 01:44:37,595
I'll do it, Marnie. You wait here.

1279
01:44:37,760 --> 01:44:40,149
Are you still in the mood for killing?

1280
01:44:42,160 --> 01:44:43,912
Please, Marnie!

1281
01:44:44,080 --> 01:44:46,833
Stay out of my way!

1282
01:44:50,160 --> 01:44:52,116
Marnie, please!

1283
01:44:52,280 --> 01:44:53,554
If you don't want me to do it,

1284
01:44:53,720 --> 01:44:56,234
then let me go back
for one of the men.

1285
01:44:56,400 --> 01:44:58,470
(Whinnies)

1286
01:45:13,320 --> 01:45:16,039
There.

1287
01:45:16,200 --> 01:45:18,350
There now.

1288
01:45:23,520 --> 01:45:28,230
So you can see, Mr Strutt,
how very disadvantageous,

1289
01:45:28,400 --> 01:45:31,233
any action on your part
would be for everyone.

1290
01:45:31,880 --> 01:45:34,474
For me, certainly.

1291
01:45:34,640 --> 01:45:37,313
For a sick girl... and for you.

1292
01:45:38,200 --> 01:45:41,078
Yes, I 'm sure that's the fashionable
attitude, Mr Rutland.

1293
01:45:41,240 --> 01:45:44,312
But just wait until
you've been victimised.

1294
01:45:51,040 --> 01:45:55,158
(Mark) Try to look at the situation
from a business point of view.

1295
01:45:55,320 --> 01:45:57,276
(Strutt) Yes.

1296
01:45:57,440 --> 01:46:02,309
(Mark) We 've been business friends
for a number of years now.

1297
01:46:02,480 --> 01:46:04,550
(Continues Indistinct)

1298
01:47:03,320 --> 01:47:06,949
(Mark) I want you to apply
them all for my benefit.

1299
01:47:07,120 --> 01:47:09,031
(Strutt) Hm.

1300
01:47:11,720 --> 01:47:15,759
- (Phone Ringing)
- Oh, sorry.

1301
01:47:15,920 --> 01:47:17,797
Hello.

1302
01:47:17,960 --> 01:47:20,110
Yes, Lil, what is it?

1303
01:47:23,920 --> 01:47:26,354
Yes, I understand.
I 'm hanging up now.

1304
01:47:26,520 --> 01:47:30,115
You' ll have to forgive me, I 've had
a bit of trouble at the hunt.

1305
01:47:30,280 --> 01:47:34,159
I'll talk to you again, possibly
tomorrow. I'm sorry to run out.

1306
01:49:01,360 --> 01:49:03,715
(Mark)
I'll take you home, Marnie.

1307
01:49:09,120 --> 01:49:11,190
It's alright, darling.

1308
01:49:16,840 --> 01:49:19,115
You're just exhausted.
Now, don't panic.

1309
01:49:23,040 --> 01:49:26,032
I've spoken to Strutt. I think
I'll be able to talk him around.

1310
01:49:34,440 --> 01:49:37,750
I'll just put this away.

1311
01:50:02,880 --> 01:50:05,348
Go on. You want the money.

1312
01:50:05,520 --> 01:50:08,034
You wanted the money, or you wouldn't
have taken my keys, would you?

1313
01:50:08,200 --> 01:50:10,191
You took the keys,
now take the money!

1314
01:50:10,360 --> 01:50:12,351
I said take it!

1315
01:50:16,720 --> 01:50:19,871
What's mine belongs to you.
It's yours!

1316
01:50:20,040 --> 01:50:21,871
You're not stealing.

1317
01:50:22,040 --> 01:50:24,634
You want the money, take it.
I said take it!

1318
01:50:42,960 --> 01:50:47,715
Marnie, now we're going to
Baltimore to see your mother.

1319
01:50:47,880 --> 01:50:50,348
- No!
- Yes.

1320
01:51:03,920 --> 01:51:06,150
Come on.

1321
01:51:11,400 --> 01:51:14,790
So, I knew you'd run away,
and you'd want money.

1322
01:51:14,960 --> 01:51:18,236
It didn't take me a minute to find out
the office drawer key was gone.

1323
01:51:19,760 --> 01:51:23,912
If you tell my mother about me,
I'll kill you.

1324
01:51:25,120 --> 01:51:27,111
If you mean about the robberies,

1325
01:51:27,280 --> 01:51:29,999
I've no intention
of telling her anything.

1326
01:51:30,160 --> 01:51:33,197
It's your mother who's
going to do the talking.

1327
01:51:35,240 --> 01:51:37,470
(Thunderclaps)

1328
01:51:42,000 --> 01:51:44,468
Marnie, come on.

1329
01:51:44,640 --> 01:51:46,551
- No!
- Come on.

1330
01:52:03,600 --> 01:52:06,876
- It's alright, Marnie. You're inside.
- (Mama) What in the wide world -

1331
01:52:07,040 --> 01:52:09,395
I'm sorry to crash in
on you like this, Mrs Edgar.

1332
01:52:09,560 --> 01:52:12,950
I guess you know
how Marnie feels about storms.

1333
01:52:13,120 --> 01:52:16,351
Marnie, stop acting like
such a ninny.

1334
01:52:16,520 --> 01:52:19,239
Who are you, mister?
You're not Mr Pendleton.

1335
01:52:19,400 --> 01:52:21,277
No, I 'm not.
Who 's Mr Pendleton?

1336
01:52:21,440 --> 01:52:23,874
Then what have you got to do
with my Marnie?

1337
01:52:24,040 --> 01:52:26,554
I'm Mark Rutland,
Marnie's husband, Mrs Edgar.

1338
01:52:26,720 --> 01:52:28,472
Marnie hasn't been very well.

1339
01:52:28,640 --> 01:52:31,108
I don't believe she 's been well
since your accident.

1340
01:52:31,280 --> 01:52:32,269
My what?

1341
01:52:32,440 --> 01:52:34,237
I think you've always
called it "your accident."

1342
01:52:34,400 --> 01:52:37,392
What do you think
you' re talking about?

1343
01:52:37,560 --> 01:52:40,791
Comin' into my house like this,
talking about my accident!

1344
01:52:42,080 --> 01:52:44,753
You're not married to Marnie.
I don't believe you.

1345
01:52:44,920 --> 01:52:48,071
- Marnie?
- Your daughter needs help, Mrs Edgar.

1346
01:52:48,240 --> 01:52:49,832
You've got to tell her the truth.

1347
01:52:50,000 --> 01:52:52,070
She has no memory
of what happened that night.

1348
01:52:52,240 --> 01:52:56,313
And she needs to remember everything!
You must help her.

1349
01:52:56,480 --> 01:52:58,994
Mister, you must be plumb crazy.

1350
01:52:59,160 --> 01:53:02,550
If you won't tell her, I will.
I know everything that happened.

1351
01:53:02,720 --> 01:53:05,439
- I'll tell her the whole story.
- Oh, no you won't,

1352
01:53:05,600 --> 01:53:09,229
because you don't know the whole story,
and nobody does but me!

1353
01:53:09,880 --> 01:53:13,668
Oh. Well, since you're so very
knowledgeable, Mrs Edgar,

1354
01:53:13,840 --> 01:53:14,989
do you also know that your daughter,

1355
01:53:15,160 --> 01:53:17,276
your beautiful, young daughter,

1356
01:53:17,440 --> 01:53:19,431
cannot stand to have a man
touch her? Any man?

1357
01:53:19,480 --> 01:53:21,550
She doesn't know why, but you do.

1358
01:53:21,840 --> 01:53:25,469
Don't you think you owe it to her to
help her to understand what happened

1359
01:53:25,640 --> 01:53:27,551
- to make her like this?
- What matters what made her?

1360
01:53:27,720 --> 01:53:31,190
She's lucky to feel like that!
Just plain lucky!

1361
01:53:32,520 --> 01:53:34,909
That's very interesting, Mrs Edgar.

1362
01:53:35,080 --> 01:53:37,071
But I've had
an investigator working here.

1363
01:53:37,160 --> 01:53:39,390
I 've read the transcript. Hm?

1364
01:53:39,560 --> 01:53:41,710
The records of your trial for murder.

1365
01:53:41,880 --> 01:53:43,757
In the records
it states quite plainly

1366
01:53:43,920 --> 01:53:46,036
that you made your
living from the touch of men.

1367
01:53:46,200 --> 01:53:51,069
It was one of your clients that
you killed that night.

1368
01:53:51,240 --> 01:53:53,959
Oh, God!

1369
01:53:54,120 --> 01:53:56,111
Was there also a storm
that night, Mrs Edgar?

1370
01:53:56,280 --> 01:53:58,236
Is that why Marnie's
terrified of storms?

1371
01:53:58,400 --> 01:54:00,675
Was there thunder
and lightning that night?

1372
01:54:00,840 --> 01:54:02,910
Did the storms terrify
your little girl,

1373
01:54:03,080 --> 01:54:04,593
in addition to everything
else that happened?

1374
01:54:04,760 --> 01:54:07,877
Get out of my house.

1375
01:54:08,040 --> 01:54:10,474
You get out!

1376
01:54:10,640 --> 01:54:13,359
I don't need any filthy man
comin' in my house no more!

1377
01:54:13,520 --> 01:54:15,158
Do you hear me? You get out!

1378
01:54:16,520 --> 01:54:19,432
You get out of my house! (Screaming)

1379
01:54:19,600 --> 01:54:21,670
You get out!

1380
01:54:23,000 --> 01:54:24,797
You let my mama go!

1381
01:54:24,960 --> 01:54:28,714
You hear? You let my mama go!

1382
01:54:28,880 --> 01:54:32,555
- You're hurtin' my mama!
- Who am I, Marnie?

1383
01:54:32,720 --> 01:54:37,430
- Why should I want to hurt your mama?
- You' re one of them.

1384
01:54:38,960 --> 01:54:42,077
- One of them in the white suits.
- Shut up, Marnie!

1385
01:54:42,240 --> 01:54:47,030
No! Remember, Marnie.
Tell us how it all was.

1386
01:54:48,000 --> 01:54:50,560
The white suits! Remember?

1387
01:54:53,520 --> 01:54:56,398
(Tapping)

1388
01:54:56,560 --> 01:54:58,835
What does the tapping mean, Marnie?

1389
01:54:59,000 --> 01:55:01,036
Why does it make you cry?

1390
01:55:01,200 --> 01:55:05,318
It means... they want in.

1391
01:55:05,480 --> 01:55:08,870
Them in their white suits.

1392
01:55:09,040 --> 01:55:13,033
Mama comes and gets me out of bed.

1393
01:55:13,200 --> 01:55:15,634
I don't like to get out of bed.

1394
01:55:33,280 --> 01:55:36,670
Come on, Marnie.

1395
01:55:36,840 --> 01:55:39,798
Get up. Alright?

1396
01:55:39,960 --> 01:55:42,918
Good girl.

1397
01:55:43,080 --> 01:55:45,992
That's my baby.

1398
01:55:46,160 --> 01:55:48,549
There.

1399
01:55:51,280 --> 01:55:53,714
There. Mm.

1400
01:55:53,880 --> 01:55:57,475
- You go on back to sleep, sugarpop.
- Bernice.

1401
01:56:03,200 --> 01:56:06,397
- (Thunderclap)
- (Sobbing)

1402
01:56:11,800 --> 01:56:16,271
Now, you ain't afraid of a little bit
of lightning, are you? Huh?

1403
01:56:18,920 --> 01:56:21,115
What happens next, Marnie?

1404
01:56:21,400 --> 01:56:26,428
He - He come out... to me.

1405
01:56:28,920 --> 01:56:32,674
Oh, I don't like him.
He - He smells funny.

1406
01:56:32,840 --> 01:56:35,718
Your old captain's gonna be here
all through the night.

1407
01:56:35,880 --> 01:56:37,199
There's no reason to cry.

1408
01:56:37,360 --> 01:56:39,078
I want my mama!

1409
01:56:39,240 --> 01:56:44,394
I don't want you! Let me go! Mama!

1410
01:56:44,560 --> 01:56:46,676
(Sobbing)

1411
01:56:46,840 --> 01:56:50,116
Get your damn hands off my kid!

1412
01:56:50,280 --> 01:56:53,192
What are you trying to -
What are you -

1413
01:56:57,520 --> 01:56:59,238
Mama?

1414
01:56:59,400 --> 01:57:02,790
Make him go, Mama.

1415
01:57:02,960 --> 01:57:06,350
I don't like him to kiss me.
Make him go, Mama!

1416
01:57:06,520 --> 01:57:08,715
(Marnie Screams)

1417
01:57:08,880 --> 01:57:11,792
Get your hands - Get your hands -

1418
01:57:11,960 --> 01:57:14,952
There's nothing the matter
with my hands!

1419
01:57:16,720 --> 01:57:19,154
(Mark) What is it, Marnie?
What's the matter?

1420
01:57:19,320 --> 01:57:20,878
He hit my mama!

1421
01:57:21,040 --> 01:57:24,430
No! No! What's the matter with you?
You crazy or drunk?

1422
01:57:24,600 --> 01:57:28,229
Now, don't go hittin' me.
You're gonna get hit yourself.

1423
01:57:31,640 --> 01:57:36,555
- (Screams)
- Oh, my leg!

1424
01:57:36,720 --> 01:57:38,597
- Mama?
- Is your mother hurt?

1425
01:57:38,760 --> 01:57:43,436
- How? How is she hurt?
- He fell on her.

1426
01:57:43,600 --> 01:57:46,398
Oh, she's so hurt! Oh, Mama.

1427
01:57:46,560 --> 01:57:49,677
Marnie! Marnie, help me!

1428
01:57:53,360 --> 01:57:54,873
I got to help my mama!

1429
01:57:55,040 --> 01:57:56,996
(Sobbing)

1430
01:58:00,720 --> 01:58:02,711
Marnie?

1431
01:58:04,240 --> 01:58:06,708
I hit him!

1432
01:58:06,880 --> 01:58:10,839
I hit him with a stick. I - I hurt him!

1433
01:58:18,520 --> 01:58:22,195
There. There now.

1434
01:58:23,840 --> 01:58:27,515
- (Screams, Sobs)
- (Screams)

1435
01:58:37,480 --> 01:58:40,711
You're alright now, darling.
You're alright.

1436
01:58:40,880 --> 01:58:43,599
It's all over.

1437
01:58:43,760 --> 01:58:45,637
You're alright.

1438
01:59:07,000 --> 01:59:10,515
I thought when she lost
her memory of that night,

1439
01:59:10,680 --> 01:59:12,955
it was a sign of God's forgiveness.

1440
01:59:13,120 --> 01:59:16,396
I thought I was being
given another chance

1441
01:59:16,560 --> 01:59:19,438
to change everything,

1442
01:59:19,600 --> 01:59:21,716
to make it all up to her.

1443
01:59:22,400 --> 01:59:24,789
I 'm sorry, Mrs Edgar.

1444
01:59:24,960 --> 01:59:27,599
Truly sorry.

1445
01:59:27,760 --> 01:59:31,435
Your mother told the police that she'd
killed the sailor in self-defense.

1446
01:59:31,600 --> 01:59:35,479
They could see how bad hurt I was.
They believed me.

1447
01:59:35,640 --> 01:59:39,758
And I never told anyone the truth.

1448
01:59:39,920 --> 01:59:41,717
Never.

1449
01:59:41,880 --> 01:59:44,394
Not even when they tried to take you
away from me, Marnie.

1450
01:59:44,560 --> 01:59:47,393
Not even then.

1451
01:59:48,680 --> 01:59:53,231
You must've loved me, Mama.
You must've loved me!

1452
01:59:56,040 --> 01:59:59,715
You're the only thing in
this world I ever did love.

1453
02:00:04,960 --> 02:00:09,590
It - it was just that
I was so young, Marnie.

1454
02:00:11,240 --> 02:00:13,879
I never had anything of my own.

1455
02:00:19,600 --> 02:00:21,716
You know how I got you, Marnie?

1456
02:00:26,880 --> 02:00:29,314
There was this boy.

1457
02:00:29,480 --> 02:00:31,789
Billy.

1458
02:00:31,960 --> 02:00:36,238
And I wanted Billy's
basketball sweater.

1459
02:00:37,320 --> 02:00:40,073
I was 15.

1460
02:00:41,360 --> 02:00:44,193
And Billy said, if I let him,

1461
02:00:44,360 --> 02:00:46,920
I could have the sweater.

1462
02:00:48,160 --> 02:00:50,151
So I let him.

1463
02:00:53,720 --> 02:00:57,679
And then, later on when you got
started, he run away.

1464
02:01:00,960 --> 02:01:03,997
I still got that old sweater.

1465
02:01:05,880 --> 02:01:07,632
And I got you, Marnie.

1466
02:01:10,720 --> 02:01:15,236
And after the accident,
when I was in the hospital,

1467
02:01:15,400 --> 02:01:18,153
they tried to make me
let you be adopted.

1468
02:01:18,320 --> 02:01:20,595
But I wouldn't.

1469
02:01:20,760 --> 02:01:22,557
I wanted you.

1470
02:01:22,720 --> 02:01:25,029
And I promised God right then,

1471
02:01:25,200 --> 02:01:29,591
if he'd let me keep you,
and you not remember,

1472
02:01:29,760 --> 02:01:33,196
I'd bring you up different from me.

1473
02:01:33,360 --> 02:01:35,396
Decent.

1474
02:01:35,560 --> 02:01:38,313
Decent?

1475
02:01:38,480 --> 02:01:41,040
Oh, Mama!

1476
02:01:42,800 --> 02:01:45,189
Well, you surely realised
your ambition.

1477
02:01:45,360 --> 02:01:48,636
I certainly am decent.

1478
02:01:49,920 --> 02:01:52,150
Of course I'm a cheat,

1479
02:01:52,320 --> 02:01:55,312
and a liar and a thief,

1480
02:01:56,360 --> 02:01:58,316
but I am decent.

1481
02:02:00,160 --> 02:02:04,995
Marnie, it's time to have a
little compassion for yourself.

1482
02:02:05,160 --> 02:02:07,549
When a child,

1483
02:02:07,720 --> 02:02:11,679
a child of any age, Marnie,
can't get love,

1484
02:02:11,840 --> 02:02:15,196
it takes what it can get,
any way it can get it.

1485
02:02:15,360 --> 02:02:18,318
It's not so hard to understand.

1486
02:02:31,440 --> 02:02:34,955
Get up, Marnie, you' re aching my leg.

1487
02:02:51,240 --> 02:02:54,630
There. That's better.

1488
02:02:56,400 --> 02:02:58,550
Mark?

1489
02:03:00,560 --> 02:03:02,630
Wha - What am I going to do?

1490
02:03:02,800 --> 02:03:05,917
What's going to happen?

1491
02:03:06,080 --> 02:03:08,594
What do you want to happen?

1492
02:03:09,840 --> 02:03:13,992
I guess I... I want it all cleared up.

1493
02:03:14,160 --> 02:03:15,752
Will I -

1494
02:03:17,000 --> 02:03:19,798
Will I go to jail?

1495
02:03:20,440 --> 02:03:24,035
No. Not after what
I have to tell them.

1496
02:03:30,320 --> 02:03:32,231
We'll go now.

1497
02:03:39,320 --> 02:03:42,153
Ah, Mrs Edgar, I'll bring Marnie back.

1498
02:03:42,320 --> 02:03:45,118
She's very tired now.

1499
02:03:46,320 --> 02:03:48,311
Goodbye, Mama.

1500
02:03:50,160 --> 02:03:52,151
Goodbye.

1501
02:03:57,800 --> 02:03:59,791
Goodbye, sugarpop.

1502
02:04:13,240 --> 02:04:15,595
Oh, Mark,

1503
02:04:15,760 --> 02:04:17,990
I don't want to go to jail.

1504
02:04:18,160 --> 02:04:19,912
I'd rather stay with you.

1505
02:04:20,080 --> 02:04:22,514
Had you, love?

1506
02:04:22,680 --> 02:04:25,399
(Girls) # Send for the doctor
over the hill.

1507
02:04:25,560 --> 02:04:28,233
# Call for the doctor.
Call for the nurse.

1508
02:04:28,400 --> 02:04:31,312
# Call for the lady
with the alligator purse.
