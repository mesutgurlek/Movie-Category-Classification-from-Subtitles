1
00:00:24,810 --> 00:00:26,641
Bjorling...

2
00:00:27,313 --> 00:00:28,974
Suliotis?

3
00:00:29,648 --> 00:00:31,809
Almost. Bjorling is easy.

4
00:00:38,991 --> 00:00:40,652
Tebaldi?

5
00:00:40,726 --> 00:00:42,990
Bingo!

6
00:00:43,062 --> 00:00:45,223
It's my turn now.

7
00:00:50,069 --> 00:00:52,629
- Don't look!
- But I'm not looking.

8
00:00:52,705 --> 00:00:54,195
Did Daddy look?

9
00:00:54,873 --> 00:00:56,363
Is that true?

10
00:01:09,288 --> 00:01:10,949
Oh, God!

11
00:01:12,725 --> 00:01:14,386
Gigli!

12
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:17,395
That's obvious!
But what's the piece?

13
00:01:30,542 --> 00:01:31,873
Never heard it!

14
00:01:31,944 --> 00:01:33,605
Is it new?

15
00:01:34,446 --> 00:01:36,107
Seems to be.

16
00:01:37,282 --> 00:01:38,943
Well, darling?

17
00:01:47,126 --> 00:01:49,060
I'd say Handel.

18
00:01:49,128 --> 00:01:51,494
Right. But what is it?

19
00:01:54,166 --> 00:01:55,997
No idea!

20
00:02:02,541 --> 00:02:03,530
Well?

21
00:02:03,609 --> 00:02:05,941
I give up. What is it?

22
00:02:06,011 --> 00:02:07,808
Three-two to me!

23
00:02:10,816 --> 00:02:13,046
So, what is it?

24
00:02:13,886 --> 00:02:15,376
Now get your hands off!

25
00:02:15,454 --> 00:02:17,388
Just listen!

26
00:03:44,309 --> 00:03:46,140
That's cheating!

27
00:03:46,211 --> 00:03:47,200
Sorry?

28
00:03:47,279 --> 00:03:49,270
It's cheating to be practicing.

29
00:03:49,348 --> 00:03:52,511
We've booked for 10:00
tomorrow morning. You are coming?

30
00:03:53,685 --> 00:03:54,913
Yes, sure.

31
00:04:00,325 --> 00:04:01,917
We'll put the boat in the water first.

32
00:04:02,594 --> 00:04:05,927
Can you give us a hand?
Let's say, in 20 minutes?

33
00:04:09,768 --> 00:04:12,202
Sure! Yes, I'll be there in 20 minutes.

34
00:04:12,271 --> 00:04:14,102
Okay. Thanks.

35
00:04:14,172 --> 00:04:15,662
See you in a tick.

36
00:04:24,950 --> 00:04:26,781
What's up with him?

37
00:04:26,852 --> 00:04:28,012
No idea.

38
00:04:28,086 --> 00:04:29,576
He seems in a huff.

39
00:04:29,655 --> 00:04:31,816
She didn't say a word.

40
00:04:31,890 --> 00:04:34,051
Who did you arrange
to play with tomorrow?

41
00:04:34,126 --> 00:04:35,457
Her.

42
00:04:35,527 --> 00:04:36,892
Yesterday?

43
00:04:36,962 --> 00:04:38,623
The day before.

44
00:04:38,697 --> 00:04:39,629
Well?

45
00:04:40,465 --> 00:04:42,126
Nothing. She was totally normal.

46
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:44,532
Sissi isn't there.

47
00:04:44,603 --> 00:04:47,595
Maybe she was just in the house.
Or at the beach.

48
00:04:49,474 --> 00:04:51,442
Who were the two laddies?

49
00:04:52,110 --> 00:04:53,270
How should I know?

50
00:04:53,345 --> 00:04:57,281
They're probably relatives.
I think his brother has a son that age.

51
00:05:33,785 --> 00:05:36,777
Don't put that there!
Take your things upstairs!

52
00:05:36,855 --> 00:05:37,844
Okay.

53
00:05:37,923 --> 00:05:39,254
Do it now!

54
00:05:39,324 --> 00:05:42,157
Don't leave things in the entrance,
or someone will trip over.

55
00:05:42,227 --> 00:05:45,719
There's still so much left in the car.

56
00:05:45,797 --> 00:05:47,788
Are you listening?

57
00:05:47,866 --> 00:05:49,731
I'm going!

58
00:05:50,235 --> 00:05:53,227
Open the windows, will you.
We need to let some air in.

59
00:05:53,305 --> 00:05:55,239
Okay, Mom!

60
00:06:02,247 --> 00:06:04,841
Stop it, Rolfi! Stop it!

61
00:06:04,916 --> 00:06:06,747
Go on, get down!

62
00:06:06,818 --> 00:06:08,683
I have to unpack!

63
00:06:09,921 --> 00:06:11,786
Go on, get out!

64
00:06:13,792 --> 00:06:15,760
- Georg?
- Yes?

65
00:06:15,827 --> 00:06:17,692
Where's the other box
with the food?

66
00:06:18,864 --> 00:06:20,195
I'll bring it right away.

67
00:06:20,265 --> 00:06:23,291
The golf gear was in the way.
I put it in the Rover last.

68
00:06:24,670 --> 00:06:29,403
We'd better get them in quick!
The things have got really hot!

69
00:06:29,474 --> 00:06:32,466
This cool-box is totally useless.

70
00:06:32,544 --> 00:06:35,707
Stop it now, you'll knock me over.

71
00:06:35,781 --> 00:06:37,510
- The butter's all soft.
- Go see your mistress.

72
00:06:38,517 --> 00:06:40,849
There're some cold cuts in the other box.

73
00:06:40,919 --> 00:06:43,046
I'll get it. I'll just open the windows.

74
00:06:45,223 --> 00:06:48,556
Leave the shutters closed on the lake side,
or it'll be too hot.

75
00:06:48,627 --> 00:06:52,620
Stop that. You'll get something
in a minute, I must just put this away.

76
00:06:52,698 --> 00:06:56,862
Can't you call the dog?
He won't let me put the things away.

77
00:06:56,968 --> 00:06:58,367
Rolfi!

78
00:06:58,403 --> 00:06:59,461
Come here!

79
00:06:59,538 --> 00:07:00,698
Come and see your master!

80
00:07:00,772 --> 00:07:04,606
And the bottles too,
otherwise it'll all be warm by the evening.

81
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:09,941
Stop it, Rolfi!

82
00:07:10,015 --> 00:07:11,505
Be quiet!

83
00:07:12,250 --> 00:07:13,740
Come in!

84
00:07:14,653 --> 00:07:16,746
Sorry. He's off his head.

85
00:07:16,822 --> 00:07:18,312
Come in!

86
00:07:19,324 --> 00:07:20,586
Hello.

87
00:07:20,659 --> 00:07:23,492
Thanks for coming.
It'd have been tough on our own.

88
00:07:23,562 --> 00:07:26,395
- No problem! This is...
- Paul. Nice to meet you.

89
00:07:26,465 --> 00:07:28,194
Paul is son of a business colleague.

90
00:07:28,266 --> 00:07:31,599
- It's a pleasure. Nice of you to help.
- Mine too.

91
00:07:31,670 --> 00:07:33,331
I mean, the pleasure's mine.

92
00:07:34,506 --> 00:07:37,566
- Not so much his.
- Will you be quiet?

93
00:07:37,642 --> 00:07:38,802
Lunatic!

94
00:07:38,877 --> 00:07:41,345
- Get into the house, go on!
- Come here, Rolfi!

95
00:07:42,347 --> 00:07:44,645
- When did you get out here?
- Last week.

96
00:07:45,150 --> 00:07:45,980
You too?

97
00:07:46,051 --> 00:07:47,484
- Yes.
- No.

98
00:07:47,552 --> 00:07:50,282
They didn't arrive till the weekend.
We came on Friday.

99
00:07:52,124 --> 00:07:53,455
Hello, Fred!

100
00:07:53,525 --> 00:07:55,618
Nice of you to come over right away.

101
00:07:57,629 --> 00:08:00,120
- How's Eva?
- Fine.

102
00:08:00,999 --> 00:08:02,660
- Hello.
- Hello, madam.

103
00:08:03,702 --> 00:08:05,192
...and where's Tropea?

104
00:08:05,270 --> 00:08:07,329
In south Italy. Right at the tip,

105
00:08:07,405 --> 00:08:10,397
- almost on the toes of the boot.
- But it's even hotter there.

106
00:08:10,475 --> 00:08:12,136
Not necessarily.

107
00:08:12,210 --> 00:08:16,374
Last year when I was in Italy it was freezing
and here you were swimming, right?

108
00:08:16,448 --> 00:08:20,248
But it's a shame Sissi isn't here.
Without her, it's...

109
00:08:20,919 --> 00:08:22,648
- Be careful!
- I am!

110
00:08:22,721 --> 00:08:25,053
Careful, or the overhauling
will have been for nothing.

111
00:08:25,123 --> 00:08:27,114
Look, you can't see anything!

112
00:08:27,192 --> 00:08:28,181
Good.

113
00:08:29,194 --> 00:08:31,219
Can you help me lift the boom over?

114
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:36,590
Mind the halyard!

115
00:08:50,949 --> 00:08:53,941
But she said she'd be there
for the whole holiday.

116
00:08:54,019 --> 00:08:58,183
Listen, my boy.
I don't know why she isn't there either.

117
00:08:58,290 --> 00:09:01,782
Maybe she went to Tropea
with a school friend. I don't know.

118
00:09:01,827 --> 00:09:05,160
Tomorrow we'll go over and ask
her mother. She's bound to explain all.

119
00:09:05,230 --> 00:09:06,891
Now stop moping...

120
00:09:06,965 --> 00:09:09,126
Why was Uncle Fred so strange?

121
00:09:09,201 --> 00:09:11,362
I'm not surprised!

122
00:09:11,436 --> 00:09:14,030
She got pretty worked up
about it last time.

123
00:09:14,706 --> 00:09:16,401
Forget it, please.

124
00:09:17,642 --> 00:09:20,338
She won't change,
and you'll just get in a state.

125
00:09:21,179 --> 00:09:22,441
Exactly!

126
00:09:23,114 --> 00:09:24,809
That's it!

127
00:09:26,318 --> 00:09:28,809
Great. They're outside
working on the boat.

128
00:09:31,256 --> 00:09:32,587
What?

129
00:09:33,725 --> 00:09:36,558
5:00 or 5:30.
I don't know the time here,

130
00:09:36,628 --> 00:09:38,459
I mean, the kitchen clock has stopped.

131
00:09:38,530 --> 00:09:40,725
I must get a new battery on Monday.

132
00:09:42,667 --> 00:09:43,998
What?

133
00:09:44,069 --> 00:09:45,832
Yes, that's what I'm doing now.

134
00:09:46,571 --> 00:09:48,300
Some fillets.

135
00:09:49,140 --> 00:09:52,974
Yes, you know, it's crazy. The whole thing
defrosted and now it needs eating.

136
00:09:53,879 --> 00:09:55,870
Come out and see us!

137
00:09:55,947 --> 00:09:59,940
No, really, like a fool, I froze
three pounds of beef fillet at once,

138
00:10:00,018 --> 00:10:02,179
and now here I am.

139
00:10:02,254 --> 00:10:05,815
No, I'm not joking.
Come and spend the weekend.

140
00:10:06,658 --> 00:10:07,590
What?

141
00:10:07,659 --> 00:10:10,127
He shouldn't make such a fuss.
Hold on.

142
00:10:10,795 --> 00:10:12,956
We need a sharp knife.

143
00:10:16,501 --> 00:10:18,560
I'd like to see it again some day.
Tell Dad.

144
00:10:18,637 --> 00:10:19,968
Sorry.

145
00:10:20,038 --> 00:10:22,529
Tell your beloved to pack up his laptop,

146
00:10:22,607 --> 00:10:25,770
get in the car, and you'll be here
in two hours at the most!

147
00:10:27,712 --> 00:10:29,577
He shouldn't be so elusive.

148
00:10:31,182 --> 00:10:32,843
Okay. Think about it.

149
00:10:32,918 --> 00:10:35,318
In any case,
there's enough steak here for a week.

150
00:10:37,355 --> 00:10:38,515
Bye, Fanny.

151
00:10:38,590 --> 00:10:40,751
Say, give us another ring anyway

152
00:10:40,825 --> 00:10:43,419
to tell us whether we can expect you.

153
00:10:43,495 --> 00:10:44,985
Yes, bye.

154
00:10:45,063 --> 00:10:47,361
- What is it now?
- Someone's here.

155
00:10:47,432 --> 00:10:49,366
- Where?
- At the door.

156
00:10:53,939 --> 00:10:54,871
Hello?

157
00:10:54,940 --> 00:10:57,067
Hello. Sorry to disturb you.

158
00:10:57,175 --> 00:10:58,665
I'm from next door.

159
00:10:58,710 --> 00:11:01,645
We saw each other
when you stopped the car at the gate.

160
00:11:01,713 --> 00:11:03,374
Oh, yes, we did.

161
00:11:04,516 --> 00:11:06,177
Come in, please.

162
00:11:07,352 --> 00:11:10,014
Hurry up, we're eating in 10 minutes!

163
00:11:10,088 --> 00:11:11,578
So what is it?

164
00:11:11,656 --> 00:11:13,146
Well...

165
00:11:13,224 --> 00:11:14,885
Eva sent...

166
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:16,951
I mean, Mrs. Berlinger sent me.

167
00:11:17,028 --> 00:11:18,518
She's just cooking...

168
00:11:19,264 --> 00:11:23,564
and she's run out of eggs.
She wonders if you can help her out.

169
00:11:23,635 --> 00:11:25,398
But of course.

170
00:11:25,470 --> 00:11:27,199
- How many does she need?
- Four.

171
00:11:27,939 --> 00:11:28,928
Four?

172
00:11:29,641 --> 00:11:31,939
- What for?
- Sorry?

173
00:11:32,010 --> 00:11:33,500
What for?

174
00:11:33,578 --> 00:11:35,569
What does she need the eggs for?

175
00:11:35,647 --> 00:11:37,308
I mean, what's she making?

176
00:11:37,382 --> 00:11:39,373
No idea.

177
00:11:40,118 --> 00:11:42,279
Are they okay like that
or shall I wrap them?

178
00:11:42,954 --> 00:11:44,444
As you like.

179
00:11:45,123 --> 00:11:46,954
So how did you get in?

180
00:11:47,025 --> 00:11:49,516
At the front.
I mean, by the beach.

181
00:11:49,594 --> 00:11:51,755
But you didn't get wet at all!

182
00:11:51,830 --> 00:11:53,320
There's a hole in the fence,

183
00:11:53,398 --> 00:11:54,888
by the water, not in the water.

184
00:11:54,966 --> 00:11:56,160
Fred knows -

185
00:11:56,234 --> 00:11:59,499
I mean, Mr. Berlinger knows it.
He showed me it.

186
00:11:59,604 --> 00:12:00,935
I see. Okay.

187
00:12:00,972 --> 00:12:02,633
So, wrapped, or is this okay?

188
00:12:02,707 --> 00:12:04,641
No, no, that's fine, no problem.

189
00:12:04,709 --> 00:12:06,677
- Many thanks.
- You're welcome.

190
00:12:09,581 --> 00:12:12,072
Love to Eva.
Look forward to the golf tomorrow!

191
00:12:12,150 --> 00:12:14,015
I'll tell her. Thanks again.

192
00:12:14,085 --> 00:12:16,576
And thanks again to Fred
and your friend -

193
00:12:16,654 --> 00:12:19,145
- Damn it!
- What's up?

194
00:12:25,296 --> 00:12:26,786
It's not a disaster.

195
00:12:26,865 --> 00:12:28,526
Hang on.

196
00:12:42,814 --> 00:12:44,873
Thank God, we just arrived...

197
00:12:45,550 --> 00:12:48,212
and I must shop
in the village on Monday.

198
00:12:48,286 --> 00:12:49,844
I'm really embarrassed.

199
00:12:49,921 --> 00:12:53,413
It's nothing. No one here eats eggs
for breakfast anyway,

200
00:12:53,491 --> 00:12:55,482
so it's not a major problem.

201
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:57,494
That's a relief, thank you.

202
00:12:58,663 --> 00:13:01,154
I should just have been more careful.

203
00:13:02,133 --> 00:13:05,830
- I put my left hand -
- Well, no point in crying over spilt milk.

204
00:13:05,904 --> 00:13:07,235
You're really kind.

205
00:13:07,305 --> 00:13:09,068
One does one's best.

206
00:13:17,048 --> 00:13:18,538
I'm really sorry.

207
00:13:22,787 --> 00:13:24,482
I'm very clumsy, you know.

208
00:13:25,824 --> 00:13:28,258
I think I've got two left hands.

209
00:13:28,326 --> 00:13:30,658
So you're ideal for carrying eggs.

210
00:13:30,728 --> 00:13:32,662
Yes, you could say.

211
00:13:34,165 --> 00:13:35,928
Well...

212
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,468
And what are we going to do now?

213
00:13:42,474 --> 00:13:46,137
We do have steak,
but we might be getting visitors,

214
00:13:46,211 --> 00:13:48,645
and they're bound to want eggs
for breakfast.

215
00:13:49,481 --> 00:13:51,676
But you'll have four left.

216
00:13:54,185 --> 00:13:57,177
After all, I did see
you had a box of twelve, right?

217
00:13:58,323 --> 00:14:00,655
You're right.

218
00:14:14,772 --> 00:14:16,433
Shouldn't I wrap them up?

219
00:14:16,508 --> 00:14:18,169
No need.

220
00:14:18,243 --> 00:14:19,403
Are you sure?

221
00:14:19,477 --> 00:14:21,308
If you want to.

222
00:14:21,379 --> 00:14:23,040
If I want to?

223
00:14:23,114 --> 00:14:25,173
Well, maybe it is better after all.

224
00:14:28,153 --> 00:14:30,485
- Oh, no!
- What's the matter?

225
00:14:32,657 --> 00:14:34,318
Oh, no!

226
00:15:06,591 --> 00:15:08,081
I'm sorry.

227
00:15:09,594 --> 00:15:14,588
Before you destroy the rest of the kitchen,
maybe you should take your eggs and leave.

228
00:15:16,434 --> 00:15:17,924
Well...

229
00:15:21,940 --> 00:15:23,771
Here you are.

230
00:15:23,841 --> 00:15:25,433
Won't you wrap them?

231
00:15:42,293 --> 00:15:44,557
I'm really sorry.

232
00:15:45,396 --> 00:15:46,886
Honestly.

233
00:15:46,965 --> 00:15:48,455
Me too.

234
00:15:55,206 --> 00:15:56,434
There.

235
00:15:56,507 --> 00:15:59,169
- Here you are.
- Many thanks. Thank you.

236
00:15:59,277 --> 00:16:01,211
I'll tell Mrs. Berlinger how nice you were.

237
00:16:01,246 --> 00:16:03,339
Okay. Do as you see fit.

238
00:16:03,414 --> 00:16:05,575
- Bye.
- Good-bye.

239
00:17:09,414 --> 00:17:11,075
Excuse me?

240
00:17:21,592 --> 00:17:22,923
Stop it! Rolfi!

241
00:17:22,994 --> 00:17:24,484
Excuse me!

242
00:17:26,264 --> 00:17:28,232
Off you go!

243
00:17:28,299 --> 00:17:29,960
Get lost!

244
00:17:30,034 --> 00:17:31,865
I mean now!

245
00:17:34,939 --> 00:17:37,806
I'm sorry. He's completely harmless.

246
00:17:37,875 --> 00:17:40,366
- He just wants to have a game.
- Funny game.

247
00:17:41,045 --> 00:17:42,706
Did he hurt you?

248
00:17:42,780 --> 00:17:44,441
Peter's just afraid of dogs.

249
00:17:44,515 --> 00:17:46,710
- I'm sorry.
- Me too.

250
00:17:46,784 --> 00:17:48,775
He jumped up on me.

251
00:17:48,853 --> 00:17:50,514
I'm sorry about that.

252
00:17:50,588 --> 00:17:52,249
Well.

253
00:17:52,323 --> 00:17:54,314
Shall I lock him in so you can leave?

254
00:17:54,392 --> 00:17:56,417
- No need.
- I can tell my husband to -

255
00:17:56,494 --> 00:17:58,485
There's really no need, thanks.

256
00:17:58,596 --> 00:18:01,258
It's my fault.
I quite forgot the dog.

257
00:18:01,299 --> 00:18:03,460
Otherwise, I'd have come to fetch the...

258
00:18:04,202 --> 00:18:05,863
Oh! What a wonderful kit!

259
00:18:05,937 --> 00:18:07,598
Gallaway, isn't it?

260
00:18:10,842 --> 00:18:12,503
It's fantastic.

261
00:18:12,577 --> 00:18:14,135
May I?

262
00:18:15,012 --> 00:18:17,378
We hardly stand a chance for tomorrow!

263
00:18:19,217 --> 00:18:21,014
Good clubs don't make good golfers.

264
00:18:21,686 --> 00:18:23,347
That's true, yes.

265
00:18:25,022 --> 00:18:27,923
Would it be cheeky of me
to ask if I can try it just once?

266
00:18:28,926 --> 00:18:31,087
Right now, outside?

267
00:18:31,162 --> 00:18:32,424
Please! Okay?

268
00:18:32,497 --> 00:18:34,488
From the lawn out to the lake, okay?

269
00:18:36,367 --> 00:18:38,198
- If it makes you happy. I -
- Thanks.

270
00:18:43,474 --> 00:18:44,964
Excuse me.

271
00:18:45,543 --> 00:18:47,374
He loves golf!

272
00:18:47,445 --> 00:18:49,413
- We both do.
- Sorry?

273
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:51,311
Both of us. We both love golf.

274
00:19:06,364 --> 00:19:07,729
Rolfi!

275
00:19:07,799 --> 00:19:09,391
Stop it!

276
00:19:09,467 --> 00:19:11,128
Rolfi!

277
00:19:11,202 --> 00:19:12,863
Be quiet now!

278
00:19:14,338 --> 00:19:15,703
What's up?

279
00:19:15,773 --> 00:19:18,606
I don't know,
probably it's too hot for him too.

280
00:19:37,295 --> 00:19:39,286
I'll go and see.

281
00:19:52,977 --> 00:19:54,808
Brilliant!

282
00:19:54,879 --> 00:19:57,211
Like the difference
between day and night.

283
00:19:58,616 --> 00:20:00,106
Thanks very much.

284
00:20:00,184 --> 00:20:01,674
You're welcome.

285
00:20:03,354 --> 00:20:05,288
Where's Tom?

286
00:20:05,356 --> 00:20:07,517
- Who?
- Did you give him the eggs?

287
00:20:07,592 --> 00:20:09,116
Sorry?

288
00:20:12,663 --> 00:20:14,597
The driver is absolutely top-class.

289
00:20:14,665 --> 00:20:15,996
You must try it.

290
00:20:16,067 --> 00:20:17,227
Listen, young man.

291
00:20:17,301 --> 00:20:21,362
I don't know what game you're playing,
but I'm not going to join in.

292
00:20:23,674 --> 00:20:25,164
Will you go now, please?

293
00:20:29,313 --> 00:20:30,803
What game?

294
00:20:31,883 --> 00:20:35,148
Sorry, madam, but I don't understand
why you're suddenly so unfriendly.

295
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:39,983
Have Tom or I
done anything to annoy you?

296
00:20:40,057 --> 00:20:41,991
Please, would you leave?

297
00:20:43,594 --> 00:20:46,290
Did you behave badly while I was outside?

298
00:20:46,964 --> 00:20:48,898
Was he cheeky?

299
00:20:48,966 --> 00:20:51,833
- Did he say anything -
- That's enough.

300
00:20:53,638 --> 00:20:56,038
I asked you to leave, so...

301
00:20:56,107 --> 00:20:57,768
please go.

302
00:20:58,843 --> 00:21:00,003
Okay.

303
00:21:00,945 --> 00:21:04,403
I don't understand what's upset you so,
but if you insist...

304
00:21:04,482 --> 00:21:06,143
Fine.

305
00:21:08,119 --> 00:21:10,952
Give the eggs to Tom
and we won't bother you again.

306
00:21:11,022 --> 00:21:12,683
I'm sorry?

307
00:21:12,757 --> 00:21:15,248
Of course we'll be telling Eva and Fred.

308
00:21:15,326 --> 00:21:18,693
Honestly, I've never experienced
anything like it before.

309
00:21:19,363 --> 00:21:21,194
What about you, Tom?

310
00:21:25,369 --> 00:21:27,564
May we have the eggs now, please?

311
00:21:28,472 --> 00:21:30,804
I told you to leave!

312
00:21:30,875 --> 00:21:32,809
Did I do something wrong...

313
00:21:32,877 --> 00:21:34,868
Now just get out of here, you...

314
00:21:34,946 --> 00:21:36,937
Is the dog with you?
What's going on?

315
00:21:37,014 --> 00:21:39,175
- Get them out!
- Good to see you, Mr. Schober.

316
00:21:39,250 --> 00:21:40,740
You are Mr. Schober, right?

317
00:21:40,818 --> 00:21:42,809
Fred, I mean, Mr. Berlinger told me.

318
00:21:42,887 --> 00:21:45,185
What?
What's the matter?

319
00:21:45,256 --> 00:21:47,747
- Throw him out!
- Your wife's mistaken.

320
00:21:47,825 --> 00:21:49,486
I'm very glad you're here.

321
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:51,721
I'm sure you can clarify
the misunderstanding.

322
00:21:51,796 --> 00:21:54,788
- Daddy, I can't -
- Please, Georg!

323
00:21:59,136 --> 00:22:01,730
It's outrageous!

324
00:22:02,740 --> 00:22:05,504
Can I explain how this
misunderstanding arose?

325
00:22:05,576 --> 00:22:08,739
Mrs. Berlinger sent me over
to fetch some eggs.

326
00:22:08,813 --> 00:22:10,303
So what? And then?

327
00:22:10,381 --> 00:22:13,714
Your wife gave the eggs to Peter,
but he smashed them.

328
00:22:13,784 --> 00:22:16,878
Yes. And she gave me
four more eggs, but...

329
00:22:16,954 --> 00:22:19,115
then the dog jumped up on me...

330
00:22:19,190 --> 00:22:20,680
and now...

331
00:22:20,758 --> 00:22:23,591
But it was a 12-pack,
and you're shopping Monday anyway...

332
00:22:23,661 --> 00:22:25,652
We just want the eggs,

333
00:22:25,730 --> 00:22:27,220
that's all.

334
00:22:27,898 --> 00:22:30,059
Can you tell me what's going on?

335
00:22:39,477 --> 00:22:40,967
Give them the eggs.

336
00:22:41,045 --> 00:22:43,206
Hold on!
Can you wait a moment?

337
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:45,305
- Can I take them?
- Just a moment.

338
00:22:45,383 --> 00:22:47,044
What's going on?

339
00:22:47,118 --> 00:22:50,610
It can't just be about these ridiculous eggs.
Why this rage?

340
00:22:50,688 --> 00:22:53,179
I'm not justifying myself to these...

341
00:22:54,358 --> 00:22:57,987
I asked you to throw them out.
I must have my reasons.

342
00:23:00,331 --> 00:23:02,663
Do as you wish.
For me, the subject is closed.

343
00:23:02,733 --> 00:23:03,893
Anna?

344
00:23:08,272 --> 00:23:09,933
Would you please leave?

345
00:23:10,441 --> 00:23:12,602
My wife doesn't feel well.

346
00:23:15,279 --> 00:23:19,511
I can't act as arbitrator in a matter
I don't know anything about.

347
00:23:19,583 --> 00:23:21,244
Please, would you leave?

348
00:23:28,259 --> 00:23:29,749
What is it?

349
00:23:29,827 --> 00:23:31,317
If you don't mind?

350
00:23:33,497 --> 00:23:35,465
So give them to him!

351
00:23:35,533 --> 00:23:37,194
What's going on?

352
00:23:37,268 --> 00:23:39,259
Nothing's going on.

353
00:23:39,336 --> 00:23:42,669
She gave him the eggs,
the dog jumped on him, he smashed them.

354
00:23:42,740 --> 00:23:45,072
He wants more.
Is it so complicated?

355
00:23:45,142 --> 00:23:46,973
What kind of tone is that supposed to be?

356
00:23:47,645 --> 00:23:49,306
Watch I don't smash your balls as well!

357
00:23:53,317 --> 00:23:55,979
Now get out! Right now!

358
00:24:00,591 --> 00:24:02,081
Is it broken?

359
00:24:05,262 --> 00:24:07,594
Be good, now.

360
00:24:07,665 --> 00:24:09,155
Behave yourself!

361
00:24:12,269 --> 00:24:13,930
Be nice!

362
00:24:14,004 --> 00:24:15,995
I don't want to hurt you,
but behave yourself!

363
00:24:21,278 --> 00:24:23,212
Please stay where you are.

364
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:24,770
Please stay there!

365
00:24:26,450 --> 00:24:29,146
- He hit me in the face.
- Yes. He started it.

366
00:24:30,988 --> 00:24:33,479
You can help him if you want,
but no messing about.

367
00:24:35,493 --> 00:24:37,654
- Bring him a chair.
- My knee!

368
00:24:37,728 --> 00:24:40,720
- He should take off his pants and sit down.
- A chair!

369
00:24:40,798 --> 00:24:43,289
Peter studies medicine. He'll fix it.

370
00:24:43,367 --> 00:24:45,528
Take off your pants, please.

371
00:24:55,846 --> 00:24:58,713
If you won't let me see your wound,
I can't help you.

372
00:24:58,816 --> 00:25:01,046
Sorry I hurt you,

373
00:25:01,085 --> 00:25:04,020
but you left me no choice,
you must admit.

374
00:25:05,189 --> 00:25:08,420
Be reasonable, Mr. Schober.
Let him look at your leg.

375
00:25:08,492 --> 00:25:10,323
He's sure to be able to help.

376
00:25:12,797 --> 00:25:14,458
Will you leave please?

377
00:25:14,532 --> 00:25:15,726
Please!

378
00:25:17,067 --> 00:25:18,728
This won't get us anywhere.

379
00:25:18,803 --> 00:25:21,636
You must let him help you.
You haven't any choice.

380
00:25:22,606 --> 00:25:24,597
You're a ship's captain, sir.

381
00:25:25,376 --> 00:25:28,675
You know that on board ship,
the Captain's word is final.

382
00:25:29,346 --> 00:25:31,337
So, what do you want to do, sir?

383
00:25:32,183 --> 00:25:34,845
Do you want to call someone?
An ambulance?

384
00:25:34,919 --> 00:25:36,409
Or the police?

385
00:25:37,154 --> 00:25:40,487
Go on! I won't stop you.
Nor will Tom.

386
00:25:40,558 --> 00:25:42,287
That's a promise!

387
00:25:42,359 --> 00:25:43,018
Right?

388
00:25:48,332 --> 00:25:49,993
What are you waiting for?

389
00:25:57,341 --> 00:25:59,901
He dropped the mobile in the water.

390
00:26:09,954 --> 00:26:11,615
Why are you doing this?

391
00:26:11,689 --> 00:26:13,179
Why not?

392
00:26:14,458 --> 00:26:16,551
Okay, then, another game.

393
00:26:17,228 --> 00:26:19,196
A guessing game.

394
00:26:20,564 --> 00:26:22,225
What's this?

395
00:26:36,981 --> 00:26:38,312
A golf ball.

396
00:26:38,382 --> 00:26:40,907
Exactly, sir, a golf ball.

397
00:26:41,986 --> 00:26:44,147
And why do I have it here in my pocket?

398
00:26:47,224 --> 00:26:49,158
The lady knows.

399
00:26:49,226 --> 00:26:50,887
Because...

400
00:26:53,998 --> 00:26:55,659
Well?

401
00:26:58,969 --> 00:26:59,799
Well?

402
00:27:01,071 --> 00:27:03,232
- Because you didn't hit it.
- Exactly!

403
00:27:03,307 --> 00:27:05,468
And why didn't I hit it?

404
00:27:05,542 --> 00:27:06,941
Because you were stopped.

405
00:27:07,011 --> 00:27:08,000
Exactly.

406
00:27:08,746 --> 00:27:10,577
And because I had to test
the club another way.

407
00:27:22,793 --> 00:27:24,818
Where is he?

408
00:27:24,895 --> 00:27:26,226
Cold.

409
00:27:28,132 --> 00:27:29,622
Cold.

410
00:27:30,367 --> 00:27:31,959
Colder.

411
00:27:34,471 --> 00:27:35,631
Cold.

412
00:27:53,057 --> 00:27:54,115
Warmer.

413
00:27:54,191 --> 00:27:55,783
Warmer.

414
00:27:58,095 --> 00:28:00,256
Hotter.

415
00:28:00,331 --> 00:28:01,662
Cold.

416
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:24,210
Really cold.

417
00:28:33,464 --> 00:28:35,625
Warmer, hotter, boiling!

418
00:28:59,823 --> 00:29:02,451
Would you kindly get me
some food from the kitchen?

419
00:29:03,627 --> 00:29:05,117
Would it be possible?

420
00:29:12,936 --> 00:29:15,427
Bananas or something like that.

421
00:29:17,775 --> 00:29:21,267
And don't think of picking up
a knife or something.

422
00:29:21,345 --> 00:29:23,176
I'd be sorry if you did.

423
00:29:23,247 --> 00:29:24,737
For your sake.

424
00:29:35,759 --> 00:29:38,250
The sun's coming out again.

425
00:29:42,933 --> 00:29:45,458
Very kind of you. Thank you.

426
00:30:01,151 --> 00:30:02,812
Hello! Sweetie!

427
00:30:06,790 --> 00:30:08,724
Where are you?

428
00:30:10,994 --> 00:30:13,155
Come on down!

429
00:30:14,498 --> 00:30:17,331
We're both thinking the same, aren't we?

430
00:30:22,673 --> 00:30:24,732
We saw your boat!

431
00:30:25,375 --> 00:30:28,276
Hello, Gerda!
Hello, Robert!

432
00:30:28,345 --> 00:30:31,007
How long have you been here?

433
00:30:31,081 --> 00:30:32,571
Not long.

434
00:30:32,649 --> 00:30:35,584
We're still unpacking.

435
00:30:35,652 --> 00:30:37,745
How long are you staying?

436
00:30:37,821 --> 00:30:39,652
A week or two.

437
00:30:39,723 --> 00:30:41,384
We're not sure yet.

438
00:30:41,458 --> 00:30:42,789
Great!

439
00:30:42,860 --> 00:30:45,624
- Hello, darling, lovely to see you.
- Hello.

440
00:30:51,702 --> 00:30:53,363
Have you met my sister?

441
00:30:53,437 --> 00:30:55,871
No! Pleased to meet you!

442
00:30:55,939 --> 00:30:57,099
Hello, Robert!

443
00:30:57,207 --> 00:30:58,902
- Everything okay?
- Of course.

444
00:31:01,378 --> 00:31:04,779
This is Paul.
He's living with our neighbors.

445
00:31:04,848 --> 00:31:07,180
- Hello, Paul!
- Hello, pleased to meet you!

446
00:31:07,251 --> 00:31:09,185
Are you cold?

447
00:31:09,253 --> 00:31:11,915
No, I have eczema.

448
00:31:11,989 --> 00:31:15,152
You should go swimming.
The water here does wonders for you.

449
00:31:15,225 --> 00:31:16,556
Thank you for the tip.

450
00:31:16,627 --> 00:31:17,992
Hello.

451
00:31:18,061 --> 00:31:19,028
How's Georg?

452
00:31:19,696 --> 00:31:21,254
Very well, thank you!

453
00:31:21,331 --> 00:31:22,821
So where is he?

454
00:31:22,900 --> 00:31:25,232
He pulled a muscle putting the mast up.

455
00:31:25,302 --> 00:31:26,792
So he's lying down.

456
00:31:26,870 --> 00:31:28,360
That's a real shame.

457
00:31:28,438 --> 00:31:30,599
That's the result of doing
everything yourself.

458
00:31:30,674 --> 00:31:35,008
Robert wouldn't dream of putting our boat
in the water on his own, right?

459
00:31:36,847 --> 00:31:39,213
Tell your beloved to pull
himself together.

460
00:31:39,283 --> 00:31:42,275
We barbecue nearly every night.
We can't do without him.

461
00:31:42,352 --> 00:31:44,013
I'll tell him!

462
00:31:44,087 --> 00:31:47,420
I mean it. As soon as he's better,
come and see us right away.

463
00:31:47,491 --> 00:31:50,892
Robert's son is here with his girlfriend.
He'll like her.

464
00:31:51,728 --> 00:31:53,059
Right then.

465
00:31:54,364 --> 00:31:55,854
Have a good time, darling.

466
00:31:55,933 --> 00:31:58,265
If the wind doesn't change, bring the car.

467
00:31:58,368 --> 00:32:00,302
The weather forecast says wind.

468
00:32:00,337 --> 00:32:02,430
For tomorrow.

469
00:32:02,506 --> 00:32:05,168
- I said to Robert we'd get nowhere.
- Where are you moored?

470
00:32:05,242 --> 00:32:06,732
What?

471
00:32:06,810 --> 00:32:09,540
Oh! Over there,
behind the headland.

472
00:32:09,613 --> 00:32:10,773
But on the other side.

473
00:32:12,115 --> 00:32:14,948
- The wooden house covered in ivy?
- That's it.

474
00:32:15,018 --> 00:32:18,112
- It looks very pretty.
- Indeed it is, young man.

475
00:32:18,188 --> 00:32:20,019
Right then. Bye!

476
00:32:26,496 --> 00:32:29,056
- Are you staying all week?
- This week, sure.

477
00:32:33,237 --> 00:32:34,727
Might see you tonight!

478
00:32:34,805 --> 00:32:37,740
As you like.
We're always pleased to see you!

479
00:32:38,475 --> 00:32:40,136
I don't know yet.

480
00:32:40,210 --> 00:32:43,543
- We'll see how Georg is.
- Yes, you see! See you soon!

481
00:32:47,050 --> 00:32:49,712
They'll be here
in two hours at the latest...

482
00:32:49,786 --> 00:32:51,617
and then this farce will be over.

483
00:32:51,688 --> 00:32:53,519
Sorry, but that's not quite true.

484
00:32:53,590 --> 00:32:55,888
I heard the end of your phone call.

485
00:32:55,959 --> 00:32:59,895
You asked your friends to call you back
if they were coming tonight.

486
00:32:59,997 --> 00:33:01,487
Or did I misunderstand you?

487
00:33:01,531 --> 00:33:04,056
Even if they can't reach us,
they'll still come.

488
00:33:04,134 --> 00:33:05,761
Is lying allowed?

489
00:33:06,670 --> 00:33:08,160
Just a moment!

490
00:33:13,877 --> 00:33:15,367
There you are. Please.

491
00:33:16,713 --> 00:33:19,045
You really can speak to us openly.

492
00:33:19,116 --> 00:33:22,950
You'll feel much better.
We're also being very open with you.

493
00:33:27,624 --> 00:33:30,457
Perhaps try putting a cushion under it.

494
00:33:31,628 --> 00:33:34,654
If you'd accepted Peter's help,
it would be hurting less.

495
00:33:36,833 --> 00:33:38,994
I'm quite willing to help you.

496
00:33:39,069 --> 00:33:41,230
But I don't want to impose.

497
00:33:45,309 --> 00:33:46,936
Careful!

498
00:33:48,445 --> 00:33:51,471
Yes, raise the leg.
That's bound to be more comfortable.

499
00:33:55,152 --> 00:33:57,484
There we are! Done!

500
00:33:58,822 --> 00:34:00,653
Can you leave it out, you bastards?

501
00:34:02,359 --> 00:34:03,849
Is that an offer?

502
00:34:03,927 --> 00:34:05,417
- What?
- Using our first names?

503
00:34:11,268 --> 00:34:13,099
I'm very happy about that.

504
00:34:13,170 --> 00:34:16,105
It does vastly simplify our communication.

505
00:34:17,774 --> 00:34:20,436
I'd still like to apologize for just now,

506
00:34:20,510 --> 00:34:22,444
for being too familiar,

507
00:34:23,113 --> 00:34:27,607
but you must admit that the smack was
an unreasonable reaction nonetheless.

508
00:34:30,487 --> 00:34:31,818
Paul.

509
00:34:35,625 --> 00:34:37,616
This is Peter.

510
00:34:39,162 --> 00:34:41,824
Come here, Tom.
Have you no manners?

511
00:34:41,898 --> 00:34:43,559
Give Georg your hand.

512
00:34:45,635 --> 00:34:47,296
Here, it's for the pain.

513
00:34:47,371 --> 00:34:49,896
What? To you, we're non-existent?

514
00:34:49,973 --> 00:34:52,305
- Being on familiar terms doesn't mean -
- You bastard...

515
00:35:09,259 --> 00:35:11,489
Quiet! Please!

516
00:35:11,561 --> 00:35:12,721
Stop!

517
00:35:14,898 --> 00:35:18,061
Stop it now, otherwise your mother
will get it, do you understand?

518
00:35:20,404 --> 00:35:21,393
Understand?

519
00:35:27,110 --> 00:35:28,771
Keep quiet now.

520
00:35:38,288 --> 00:35:40,950
What a scene,
just for being on first-name terms!

521
00:35:54,638 --> 00:35:57,004
We were only trying to improve relations.

522
00:35:57,908 --> 00:36:00,172
- I thought we could -
- Why are you doing that?

523
00:36:03,180 --> 00:36:04,841
Fatty, why are you doing that?

524
00:36:09,586 --> 00:36:11,076
Go on, tell us!

525
00:36:12,589 --> 00:36:15,649
I don't know. I...

526
00:36:15,725 --> 00:36:17,215
The Captain wants to know.

527
00:36:17,294 --> 00:36:18,124
Why?

528
00:36:19,463 --> 00:36:20,760
Well?

529
00:36:24,935 --> 00:36:27,495
It's difficult to talk about it. I...

530
00:36:27,571 --> 00:36:29,061
Don't be shy.

531
00:36:30,807 --> 00:36:32,775
You know just how hard it is...

532
00:36:33,710 --> 00:36:36,144
My God, what a fuss!

533
00:36:36,813 --> 00:36:38,576
His father got a divorce...

534
00:36:38,648 --> 00:36:40,138
when he was still that tiny,

535
00:36:41,117 --> 00:36:43,449
- and he took another woman -
- That's not true!

536
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:45,010
He's lying!

537
00:36:48,091 --> 00:36:50,150
It was my mother who divorced...

538
00:36:50,227 --> 00:36:51,353
because...

539
00:36:53,530 --> 00:36:55,020
because...

540
00:36:58,535 --> 00:36:59,866
I...

541
00:37:04,941 --> 00:37:08,775
Because she wanted to have
her little teddy all to herself,

542
00:37:08,845 --> 00:37:11,177
and since then,
he's been a queer and a crook.

543
00:37:11,248 --> 00:37:12,806
You see?

544
00:37:14,818 --> 00:37:16,911
You're an asshole!

545
00:37:16,987 --> 00:37:21,424
The truth is, he comes from
a filthy, deprived family,

546
00:37:22,092 --> 00:37:23,992
he has five brothers and sisters

547
00:37:24,060 --> 00:37:25,721
who are all drug addicts.

548
00:37:26,897 --> 00:37:28,387
His dad's an alcoholic,

549
00:37:28,465 --> 00:37:31,400
and as for his mother,
you can imagine.

550
00:37:31,468 --> 00:37:33,959
Or rather, the truth is,
it's him who fucks her.

551
00:37:36,306 --> 00:37:37,796
Tough,

552
00:37:37,874 --> 00:37:39,364
but true.

553
00:37:40,043 --> 00:37:42,011
Come on, calm down now.

554
00:37:44,147 --> 00:37:48,481
You're disgusting. Can't you cut out
your obscenities in front of the child?

555
00:37:48,552 --> 00:37:49,883
Oh! Sorry.

556
00:37:49,953 --> 00:37:51,818
Of course.
What answer would you like?

557
00:37:52,722 --> 00:37:54,553
What would satisfy you?

558
00:37:56,893 --> 00:38:00,158
Anyway, what I said isn't true.
You know that as well as I.

559
00:38:01,998 --> 00:38:03,659
Look at him.

560
00:38:04,401 --> 00:38:07,370
Do you really think he comes from
a deprived background?

561
00:38:08,104 --> 00:38:09,537
Right.

562
00:38:10,540 --> 00:38:12,872
He's a spoiled little shit-face,

563
00:38:14,144 --> 00:38:17,136
tormented by ennui and world-weariness,

564
00:38:17,213 --> 00:38:19,181
weighed down by the void of existence!

565
00:38:21,952 --> 00:38:23,715
That's hard, honestly!

566
00:38:28,325 --> 00:38:30,657
You see, he's smiling again.

567
00:38:34,898 --> 00:38:35,830
Right.

568
00:38:35,899 --> 00:38:37,730
Satisfied?

569
00:38:38,401 --> 00:38:40,892
Or another version?

570
00:38:48,979 --> 00:38:50,469
I'm hungry.

571
00:38:50,547 --> 00:38:52,708
I'll see what there is.

572
00:38:59,656 --> 00:39:02,250
You see, the truth is,
he's a drug addict.

573
00:39:03,593 --> 00:39:05,925
That's why he's going now, and...

574
00:39:09,599 --> 00:39:12,295
That's why he has bad nerves, you see.

575
00:39:12,369 --> 00:39:14,200
Me too, I'm a drug addict.

576
00:39:15,205 --> 00:39:19,301
Together we rob rich families
in smart houses

577
00:39:19,376 --> 00:39:21,708
so we can afford the stuff.

578
00:39:22,879 --> 00:39:24,813
Can you stop this lunacy?

579
00:39:24,881 --> 00:39:27,247
I get the message,

580
00:39:27,317 --> 00:39:29,615
isn't that enough for you?

581
00:39:29,686 --> 00:39:31,449
You get the message?

582
00:39:31,521 --> 00:39:33,682
Great!

583
00:39:34,624 --> 00:39:37,058
Fatty! He's got it!

584
00:39:38,762 --> 00:39:40,855
Now he knows everything!

585
00:39:42,365 --> 00:39:44,196
That's fantastic, really.

586
00:39:45,135 --> 00:39:46,466
Listen.

587
00:39:46,536 --> 00:39:48,026
Peter, come in here!

588
00:39:49,039 --> 00:39:51,405
Listen, we're going to bet, okay?

589
00:39:52,409 --> 00:39:54,070
Sit down, come on!

590
00:39:54,577 --> 00:39:57,239
- It's dark in here.
- Now don't fall asleep!

591
00:39:59,049 --> 00:40:01,210
We'll bet that -

592
00:40:01,284 --> 00:40:03,775
What's the time?

593
00:40:03,853 --> 00:40:05,718
Twenty to 9:00.

594
00:40:05,789 --> 00:40:08,622
That in, let's say, 12 hours...

595
00:40:08,692 --> 00:40:10,489
all three of you'll be kaput.

596
00:40:14,698 --> 00:40:15,926
What?

597
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:19,625
You bet us, that tomorrow at 9:00,
you'll be alive,

598
00:40:19,703 --> 00:40:21,534
and we bet you,
you'll be dead, okay?

599
00:40:36,152 --> 00:40:37,346
They don't want to bet.

600
00:40:39,289 --> 00:40:41,223
That's no good. You have to bet.

601
00:40:41,991 --> 00:40:45,085
What do you think?
Do you think they've a chance of winning?

602
00:40:45,161 --> 00:40:47,425
You are on their side, aren't you?

603
00:40:47,497 --> 00:40:49,158
So, who will you bet with?

604
00:40:49,232 --> 00:40:50,893
What kind of bet is this?

605
00:40:50,967 --> 00:40:53,936
Dead, they can give nothing,
and conversely, they can win nothing.

606
00:40:54,003 --> 00:40:56,471
They'll lose in any case. Obviously.

607
00:40:56,539 --> 00:40:58,029
Stop this nonsense.

608
00:40:58,141 --> 00:41:00,336
Are you trying to scare us?

609
00:41:01,478 --> 00:41:03,503
Isn't what you've done already enough?

610
00:41:05,682 --> 00:41:07,172
What do you want? Our money?

611
00:41:07,250 --> 00:41:08,911
Help yourselves and get out.

612
00:41:11,254 --> 00:41:14,917
Don't you think Fred and Eva
might come and see what's going on?

613
00:41:14,991 --> 00:41:17,585
And give us a good hiding, right?

614
00:41:22,665 --> 00:41:23,825
Okay.

615
00:41:23,900 --> 00:41:25,390
As they say on TV:

616
00:41:25,468 --> 00:41:27,129
The bets are placed!

617
00:41:28,805 --> 00:41:31,137
And what'll we do now?

618
00:41:31,207 --> 00:41:34,005
Could you kindly make us some food?

619
00:41:34,677 --> 00:41:36,338
You worry me, Fatty.

620
00:41:37,013 --> 00:41:39,243
Can't you control yourself?

621
00:41:39,916 --> 00:41:42,248
You've just gobbled up the sausage.

622
00:41:43,419 --> 00:41:44,909
It's disgusting.

623
00:41:44,988 --> 00:41:46,478
What are these people going to think?

624
00:41:46,556 --> 00:41:48,387
I haven't eaten since lunchtime!

625
00:41:48,458 --> 00:41:50,358
And stop calling me Fatty.

626
00:41:50,426 --> 00:41:52,553
- Okay, Tom.
- Okay, Jerry.

627
00:41:54,664 --> 00:41:56,996
But can't you pay some attention
to your appearance?

628
00:41:57,667 --> 00:41:59,999
You think it makes you more attractive?

629
00:42:02,338 --> 00:42:03,999
Look at the Captain's wife.

630
00:42:04,908 --> 00:42:07,001
Do you think she finds you attractive?

631
00:42:07,977 --> 00:42:09,968
- With your flab?
- Stop it!

632
00:42:11,481 --> 00:42:13,278
Look at her.

633
00:42:13,349 --> 00:42:14,839
She's not as old as all that.

634
00:42:16,019 --> 00:42:17,509
Excuse me, madam.

635
00:42:18,955 --> 00:42:21,355
You'd be quite acceptable to her,

636
00:42:21,424 --> 00:42:23,585
but with that figure of yours!

637
00:42:24,360 --> 00:42:26,021
Follow her example.

638
00:42:26,095 --> 00:42:28,427
Her body's really in shape.

639
00:42:28,498 --> 00:42:30,193
Not a single extra calorie!

640
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:32,831
I'm not so sure!

641
00:42:33,503 --> 00:42:34,902
What?

642
00:42:36,339 --> 00:42:38,705
Did you hear that, madam?

643
00:42:40,210 --> 00:42:41,871
That's really cheeky!

644
00:42:42,545 --> 00:42:44,911
We can't put up with that, can we?

645
00:42:53,523 --> 00:42:55,354
Hey you! Indian!

646
00:42:56,192 --> 00:42:57,853
What's your name anyway?

647
00:43:02,198 --> 00:43:03,631
Georg.

648
00:43:04,901 --> 00:43:06,391
Like Daddy.

649
00:43:06,469 --> 00:43:07,766
Lovely!

650
00:43:09,105 --> 00:43:11,437
Georgie-boy, come over to me.

651
00:43:13,009 --> 00:43:14,499
Come here.

652
00:43:19,816 --> 00:43:22,376
Come on. Sit down beside me.
We're going to play a game.

653
00:43:22,452 --> 00:43:23,441
Let the boy go!

654
00:43:24,821 --> 00:43:27,654
I know you don't want to play,
but you'll see, it's fun.

655
00:43:27,724 --> 00:43:29,385
Let the boy go!

656
00:43:31,361 --> 00:43:34,353
See how your mother's
standing up for you?

657
00:43:34,430 --> 00:43:37,365
- Dad could take an example from her!
- Stop it!

658
00:43:37,433 --> 00:43:40,095
For that we're going
to let your mom play with us.

659
00:43:41,337 --> 00:43:42,998
Hold Georgie a moment.

660
00:43:45,008 --> 00:43:48,000
We're playing a nice little game:
Kitten in the Bag.

661
00:43:50,013 --> 00:43:51,503
You'll see, it's fun.

662
00:43:54,517 --> 00:43:56,849
There! Don't panic! Nothing will happen.

663
00:43:56,953 --> 00:43:59,114
I said this is a nice game.

664
00:43:59,155 --> 00:44:00,645
A family game.

665
00:44:01,491 --> 00:44:04,619
Daddy is playing too
so he doesn't get bored.

666
00:44:04,694 --> 00:44:06,685
Right. Now listen!

667
00:44:07,363 --> 00:44:09,524
You'll have to keep still, or it's no fun.

668
00:44:10,867 --> 00:44:12,528
Hey! Listen now!

669
00:44:14,470 --> 00:44:15,960
That's right, Georgie.

670
00:44:16,806 --> 00:44:18,774
We'll work together, okay?

671
00:44:20,276 --> 00:44:23,768
The pillow case isn't uncomfortable, is it?
You've enough air, haven't you?

672
00:44:26,282 --> 00:44:28,216
You've enough air, haven't you?

673
00:44:28,284 --> 00:44:29,114
Yes.

674
00:44:29,185 --> 00:44:30,880
Great. Then we can finally start.

675
00:44:31,554 --> 00:44:33,385
So, the starting point of our game

676
00:44:33,456 --> 00:44:37,620
was that mommy and our little Indian
wanted to slip out of here.

677
00:44:37,694 --> 00:44:39,662
- But why?
- Don't know.

678
00:44:39,729 --> 00:44:41,390
Is lying allowed, Fatty?

679
00:44:42,732 --> 00:44:45,394
What an example you're setting!
You know why.

680
00:44:45,468 --> 00:44:47,129
You mentioned her flab.

681
00:44:47,203 --> 00:44:48,602
What do you mean, me?

682
00:44:48,671 --> 00:44:50,832
It was you who doubted her flawlessness!

683
00:44:51,774 --> 00:44:53,708
Okay. Forget it!

684
00:44:53,776 --> 00:44:57,041
I understand too how it embarrassed her.
With the boy here.

685
00:44:57,146 --> 00:44:58,977
That's why we play
"Kitten in the Bag."

686
00:44:59,015 --> 00:45:00,949
To preserve moral decency.

687
00:45:01,017 --> 00:45:05,010
The kiddy wears a pillow case
While mummy strips off, in great haste!

688
00:45:09,292 --> 00:45:11,783
We mustn't hurt the kitty cat, right?
Dad's broken leg is enough.

689
00:45:11,861 --> 00:45:13,692
Let the child go. Please!

690
00:45:13,763 --> 00:45:15,822
Exactly. Daddy's playing with us too.

691
00:45:21,471 --> 00:45:23,132
What are we waiting for?

692
00:45:26,142 --> 00:45:30,238
Tell your wife not to be so shy.
It's ridiculous.

693
00:45:30,313 --> 00:45:32,178
Anyway, I'm sure she isn't flabby.

694
00:45:33,850 --> 00:45:36,341
Please, let the child go.

695
00:45:37,186 --> 00:45:38,517
Please!

696
00:45:39,856 --> 00:45:42,381
You only have to say to her,
"Get undressed."

697
00:45:44,327 --> 00:45:46,124
I beg you!

698
00:45:48,131 --> 00:45:49,962
"Get undressed, my darling."

699
00:46:12,288 --> 00:46:13,778
Get undressed.

700
00:46:16,125 --> 00:46:18,286
"Get undressed, my darling."

701
00:46:22,965 --> 00:46:25,126
Get undressed, my darling.

702
00:47:47,116 --> 00:47:48,048
Well done.

703
00:47:48,117 --> 00:47:50,813
What did I say? Not an ounce of flab.

704
00:47:50,887 --> 00:47:52,548
Now, let's get dressed again.

705
00:48:30,793 --> 00:48:33,455
Fatty, can you take the little piggy?

706
00:48:33,529 --> 00:48:35,690
He isn't quite potty-trained.

707
00:48:35,765 --> 00:48:37,596
Go and clean him up.

708
00:48:37,667 --> 00:48:40,329
- Let the child go!
- I won't do anything to him.

709
00:49:27,617 --> 00:49:29,278
Will you sit down, please?

710
00:49:32,622 --> 00:49:34,954
I'd advise you not to kick me.

711
00:49:47,470 --> 00:49:49,961
I hope you won't be
too bored with these two.

712
00:49:51,374 --> 00:49:53,501
Pour a pan of water over his head.

713
00:49:55,578 --> 00:49:58,069
But make sure you don't ruin the carpet.

714
00:50:26,676 --> 00:50:29,167
No, no, of course that was a joke.

715
00:50:29,245 --> 00:50:31,577
I have to retake Latin in the autumn.

716
00:50:31,647 --> 00:50:35,981
If I pass it, then things will get moving.
I'll study commercial law.

717
00:50:36,052 --> 00:50:38,213
But before that there's military service.

718
00:50:39,055 --> 00:50:40,716
Does it hurt a lot?

719
00:50:40,790 --> 00:50:42,451
Why don't you kill us right away?

720
00:50:43,125 --> 00:50:46,652
Don't forget the entertainment value.
We'd all be deprived of our pleasure.

721
00:51:46,355 --> 00:51:48,585
Sorry about your leg.

722
00:51:48,657 --> 00:51:50,921
But it's your fault, if I might say so.

723
00:51:51,594 --> 00:51:53,425
Why did you smack Paul?

724
00:51:57,633 --> 00:52:00,625
For me, begging for the eggs
to no avail was very unpleasant.

725
00:52:01,804 --> 00:52:03,931
Humiliating, actually.

726
00:52:04,006 --> 00:52:05,667
I don't know if you realize that.

727
00:52:06,809 --> 00:52:09,141
It's just not worth it,

728
00:52:09,211 --> 00:52:11,702
all this charade, for a box of eggs.

729
00:52:15,484 --> 00:52:18,976
They should still be there.

730
00:52:19,054 --> 00:52:21,887
You should have trusted
what your wife said.

731
00:52:21,957 --> 00:52:25,620
She really begged you just
to let us leave with the eggs.

732
00:52:25,694 --> 00:52:27,855
Naturally one's always wiser
after the event.

733
00:52:29,765 --> 00:52:31,824
Ah! There they are!

734
00:52:34,336 --> 00:52:36,327
One of them is cracked.

735
00:52:36,405 --> 00:52:40,068
It's not bad, what these boxes withstand.
When you think-

736
00:52:40,843 --> 00:52:43,175
Why are you doing that?

737
00:52:43,245 --> 00:52:45,236
How stupid do you think I am?

738
00:52:45,314 --> 00:52:48,977
I don't understand. You're really
forcing me to treat you badly.

739
00:52:53,989 --> 00:52:56,651
Jesus! That's it! You've done it now!

740
00:52:59,695 --> 00:53:02,562
And Paul even said
we should take care of the carpet!

741
00:53:05,734 --> 00:53:07,725
Please, let us go!

742
00:53:11,540 --> 00:53:13,906
You're so young still!

743
00:53:15,978 --> 00:53:17,912
You have all your life before you!

744
00:53:20,649 --> 00:53:23,311
Nothing's happened yet!

745
00:53:24,820 --> 00:53:26,014
We'll say...

746
00:53:26,088 --> 00:53:29,114
that Georg broke his leg in the boat.

747
00:53:30,059 --> 00:53:32,391
- Everyone'll believe it, and -
- Please stop.

748
00:53:32,461 --> 00:53:34,122
Why are you humiliating yourself?

749
00:53:34,196 --> 00:53:36,255
It's just as unpleasant for me as for you.

750
00:54:14,055 --> 00:54:15,386
Georgie?

751
00:54:16,891 --> 00:54:18,381
Where are you?

752
00:55:43,895 --> 00:55:45,385
Georgie!

753
00:55:45,463 --> 00:55:46,953
I'm coming!

754
00:56:41,086 --> 00:56:43,247
Hold on,
I'll put on some music for us.

755
00:57:26,698 --> 00:57:28,632
Don't come any closer!

756
00:57:30,869 --> 00:57:32,598
The trigger!

757
00:57:34,606 --> 00:57:36,540
You have to prime the trigger!

758
00:57:53,391 --> 00:57:55,552
And you need to pull it too!

759
00:58:55,220 --> 00:58:57,381
Tralee trala, here we are!

760
00:58:58,723 --> 00:59:00,088
Mommy!

761
00:59:03,161 --> 00:59:04,753
Hello, my darling!

762
00:59:05,930 --> 00:59:07,955
Is everything okay?

763
00:59:12,070 --> 00:59:13,332
They've -

764
00:59:13,838 --> 00:59:16,272
They've killed Sissi!

765
00:59:16,941 --> 00:59:18,465
- Hi, Beavis!
- Hi, Butt-Head!

766
00:59:19,144 --> 00:59:21,408
- Everything under control?
- Looks like it.

767
00:59:24,315 --> 00:59:25,339
May I?

768
00:59:25,416 --> 00:59:27,077
Please. Sure.

769
00:59:28,253 --> 00:59:31,416
You must wonder, Captain,
where this lovely rifle comes from.

770
00:59:32,924 --> 00:59:34,482
Or does it seem familiar?

771
00:59:34,993 --> 00:59:37,188
Haven't you ever been hunting with Fred?

772
00:59:39,364 --> 00:59:42,527
Do you know, your little darling
just tried to kill me with it?

773
00:59:45,537 --> 00:59:49,701
Scarcely believable, but it's the truth,
and nothing but the truth.

774
00:59:49,774 --> 00:59:51,264
Isn't that right, Georgie?

775
00:59:56,381 --> 00:59:58,042
What do you say, Tom?

776
00:59:58,116 --> 00:59:59,447
Dreadful.

777
01:00:01,386 --> 01:00:03,047
What's the time?

778
01:00:03,121 --> 01:00:05,783
Just after 11:00.

779
01:00:05,857 --> 01:00:08,826
We should start thinking about our bet,
don't you think?

780
01:00:10,995 --> 01:00:14,658
Actually we ought to be grateful
to Georgie for helping us.

781
01:00:15,333 --> 01:00:16,664
One for Beavis,

782
01:00:16,734 --> 01:00:18,497
one for Butt-Head.

783
01:00:22,273 --> 01:00:25,174
A, B, BOO and out go you!

784
01:00:25,243 --> 01:00:29,703
You're not leaving at this stage.
First you'll have to say your age.

785
01:00:32,450 --> 01:00:33,781
Well?

786
01:00:37,355 --> 01:00:38,982
She doesn't want to play.

787
01:00:39,490 --> 01:00:41,583
Well, how old do you think she is?

788
01:00:43,595 --> 01:00:45,085
37?

789
01:00:47,098 --> 01:00:48,827
No flab...

790
01:00:49,334 --> 01:00:51,029
So I'd say,

791
01:00:51,102 --> 01:00:53,593
let's be generous,
let's say 35.

792
01:00:55,907 --> 01:00:56,839
Agreed?

793
01:00:59,677 --> 01:01:01,008
She agrees.

794
01:01:01,079 --> 01:01:03,070
Who are you going to start counting with?

795
01:01:03,781 --> 01:01:04,713
Her?

796
01:01:09,187 --> 01:01:11,678
And now I'm going to
get myself something to eat.

797
01:01:13,358 --> 01:01:15,019
One, two, three,

798
01:01:15,093 --> 01:01:17,186
four, five, six, seven...

799
01:01:33,711 --> 01:01:35,645
Can I get anyone anything?

800
01:02:12,317 --> 01:02:14,251
You're an idiot, Fatty.

801
01:02:14,319 --> 01:02:17,686
You don't shoot the person you've
counted out, but the one that's left over!

802
01:02:17,755 --> 01:02:19,086
What's wrong with you?

803
01:02:19,157 --> 01:02:21,318
- He tried to escape!
- So what?

804
01:02:21,392 --> 01:02:23,553
That's no reason
to get trigger-happy.

805
01:02:23,628 --> 01:02:25,118
Have you no sense of timing?

806
01:02:25,964 --> 01:02:27,454
What's the time?

807
01:02:27,532 --> 01:02:29,295
Just before 12:00.

808
01:02:29,367 --> 01:02:30,857
Shit.

809
01:02:30,935 --> 01:02:32,596
We'll get nothing from the others now.

810
01:02:33,771 --> 01:02:36,604
- Let's get out of here.
- Fine.

811
01:02:36,674 --> 01:02:40,633
Thanks so much for the driver.
I'll put it back in the bag, okay?

812
01:02:40,712 --> 01:02:41,701
Thanks.

813
01:02:42,847 --> 01:02:44,337
So, have a good evening!

814
01:02:44,415 --> 01:02:45,746
Good-bye!

815
01:02:45,817 --> 01:02:47,114
Bye!

816
01:05:11,195 --> 01:05:13,129
They've gone.

817
01:05:50,501 --> 01:05:53,163
Do you hear? They've gone!

818
01:06:36,714 --> 01:06:39,205
I'll get a knife.

819
01:08:28,192 --> 01:08:30,217
Come on.
Calm down now.

820
01:08:35,700 --> 01:08:38,032
Take deep breaths.

821
01:08:41,605 --> 01:08:43,095
Come on, darling.

822
01:08:44,375 --> 01:08:46,036
Calm down now.

823
01:08:48,713 --> 01:08:50,544
Calm yourself.

824
01:08:53,050 --> 01:08:54,381
Calm yourself.

825
01:08:54,452 --> 01:08:57,285
That's it. Take some deep breaths.

826
01:10:52,269 --> 01:10:54,601
We've got to get out of here.

827
01:10:56,440 --> 01:10:58,499
What if they come back?

828
01:11:01,178 --> 01:11:03,612
Do you think you can walk
if I support you?

829
01:11:08,552 --> 01:11:10,042
I'll try.

830
01:11:19,897 --> 01:11:22,229
What's wrong with your arm?

831
01:11:28,005 --> 01:11:32,066
Shall I try and make a splint for it?
Then I can hold you better.

832
01:11:33,744 --> 01:11:35,905
No, it's okay. Come on.

833
01:12:00,871 --> 01:12:02,361
Let's go.

834
01:12:09,446 --> 01:12:10,936
Let's go.

835
01:12:20,724 --> 01:12:22,214
Okay?

836
01:12:32,236 --> 01:12:33,897
No! Anna!

837
01:12:35,940 --> 01:12:37,305
No!

838
01:13:24,555 --> 01:13:26,216
They've locked the door.

839
01:13:27,191 --> 01:13:29,022
We must use the window.

840
01:13:29,093 --> 01:13:30,583
I can't.

841
01:13:30,661 --> 01:13:32,151
Georg!

842
01:13:32,229 --> 01:13:34,561
- Please!
- I can't manage it.

843
01:13:34,632 --> 01:13:35,792
You go.

844
01:13:35,866 --> 01:13:39,358
It's crazy wasting so much time.
Run for it. Please!

845
01:13:39,436 --> 01:13:41,267
Climb out of the kitchen window.

846
01:13:41,338 --> 01:13:43,499
Try to get as far as the inn, or...

847
01:13:43,574 --> 01:13:46,065
If we're locked in here,
the gate will be shut too.

848
01:13:47,745 --> 01:13:49,679
That's true.

849
01:13:50,514 --> 01:13:53,176
Take a pair of pliers and cut the fence.

850
01:13:53,250 --> 01:13:57,186
But careful on the road.
Maybe they're waiting out there.

851
01:13:58,689 --> 01:14:00,714
Where are the pliers?

852
01:14:03,394 --> 01:14:05,487
I don't know.

853
01:14:05,562 --> 01:14:07,553
Here, in the kitchen.

854
01:14:09,566 --> 01:14:11,056
No,

855
01:14:11,135 --> 01:14:12,659
down at the boat shed.

856
01:14:13,871 --> 01:14:15,862
I can't leave you alone here.

857
01:14:15,939 --> 01:14:17,429
Go now, please!

858
01:14:18,776 --> 01:14:20,937
Put some clothes on.

859
01:14:21,011 --> 01:14:23,502
And shoes too, so you can run.

860
01:14:29,186 --> 01:14:31,347
Hold on, the bag's still here.

861
01:14:31,422 --> 01:14:32,912
Down there.

862
01:14:45,536 --> 01:14:47,470
I'll hide down in the wine cellar.

863
01:14:48,138 --> 01:14:49,969
The key must be in the door.

864
01:14:51,909 --> 01:14:54,742
I'll shut myself in
and wait for you to come back.

865
01:14:59,750 --> 01:15:02,082
How will you get down there?

866
01:15:02,152 --> 01:15:03,642
I'll manage.

867
01:15:19,870 --> 01:15:21,804
Go now! Please!

868
01:15:42,559 --> 01:15:44,493
The mobile! It's working again!

869
01:15:44,561 --> 01:15:45,493
What?

870
01:15:45,562 --> 01:15:48,053
It's working!
It's obviously dried out.

871
01:15:48,132 --> 01:15:50,293
- So get on the phone!
- Who to?

872
01:15:50,367 --> 01:15:52,858
Anyone! The police!

873
01:15:52,936 --> 01:15:54,597
What's their number?

874
01:15:54,671 --> 01:15:56,332
No idea.

875
01:15:56,440 --> 01:15:57,805
Call my mother...

876
01:15:57,841 --> 01:15:59,809
Your father-
No, wait...

877
01:15:59,877 --> 01:16:02,539
Call Peter, he's at home,
I know, he wanted to -

878
01:16:02,613 --> 01:16:05,275
Press four and then hit speed-dial.

879
01:16:08,118 --> 01:16:09,608
It's not ringing.

880
01:16:12,122 --> 01:16:13,612
Let me listen.

881
01:16:16,794 --> 01:16:18,125
But there is a signal!

882
01:16:18,195 --> 01:16:20,356
Some of the contacts
are probably still damp.

883
01:16:39,383 --> 01:16:40,372
Nothing.

884
01:16:42,553 --> 01:16:45,215
Get the hair dryer.
Maybe it'll help.

885
01:16:46,056 --> 01:16:48,217
Can you pass me the chair?

886
01:17:15,018 --> 01:17:16,849
It won't work.

887
01:19:00,657 --> 01:19:02,147
Leave it, come on.

888
01:19:03,493 --> 01:19:05,393
Maybe it's permanently broken.

889
01:19:05,462 --> 01:19:06,952
Get going!

890
01:19:09,633 --> 01:19:13,125
We're wasting far too much time.
Let me do it.

891
01:19:15,472 --> 01:19:17,303
Go on!

892
01:19:19,810 --> 01:19:21,971
Pull me over there on the chair.

893
01:19:22,045 --> 01:19:24,536
I think it'll be easier than walking.

894
01:19:57,214 --> 01:19:58,408
Thanks.

895
01:19:59,883 --> 01:20:01,817
And now, run!

896
01:20:14,398 --> 01:20:16,366
Please, forgive me!

897
01:20:23,573 --> 01:20:25,165
It -

898
01:20:36,253 --> 01:20:38,244
I love you!

899
01:20:47,431 --> 01:20:48,921
Run, please!

900
01:22:45,081 --> 01:22:47,242
Help!

901
01:23:19,549 --> 01:23:22,040
Peter? It's Georg!

902
01:23:23,553 --> 01:23:26,488
Can you hear me?
I can barely hear you!

903
01:23:28,325 --> 01:23:30,987
Listen, if you can hear me,

904
01:23:31,061 --> 01:23:33,928
send the police over to our
lake house, right away!

905
01:23:35,665 --> 01:23:36,927
Hello?

906
01:23:37,434 --> 01:23:39,299
Shit!

907
01:23:51,081 --> 01:23:53,015
Peter! Can you hear me?

908
01:26:00,510 --> 01:26:01,670
Stop!

909
01:28:15,011 --> 01:28:16,501
Missed!

910
01:28:16,579 --> 01:28:18,069
Morning, Captain.

911
01:28:19,716 --> 01:28:21,206
Morning.

912
01:28:21,284 --> 01:28:24,117
They'll be there any minute.

913
01:28:24,187 --> 01:28:27,179
We'll have to hurry then.
Right, Beavis?

914
01:28:27,257 --> 01:28:29,088
Why don't you believe me?

915
01:28:29,158 --> 01:28:32,355
- How old did we say? 37?
- 35.

916
01:28:32,428 --> 01:28:36,489
Good that the battery
charger's in the car!

917
01:28:36,566 --> 01:28:39,000
- If it's her age, you must start with her.
- Why?

918
01:28:39,068 --> 01:28:40,899
- The battery was okay.
- That's the rules.

919
01:28:40,970 --> 01:28:42,801
Okay, I'll start with her.

920
01:28:42,872 --> 01:28:45,204
Yes, I know.

921
01:28:45,275 --> 01:28:49,211
It's time you had another idea.
The lady tried that trick before.

922
01:28:49,279 --> 01:28:50,769
Count faster, Beavis.

923
01:28:52,448 --> 01:28:54,541
Do you think we have no imagination?

924
01:28:54,617 --> 01:28:57,450
Without risk, you can't have a bet,
that's obvious, Captain.

925
01:28:57,554 --> 01:28:59,488
You must have a chance too.

926
01:28:59,522 --> 01:29:04,221
The wind blows where it wishes.
That's the joy of sailing, don't you think?

927
01:29:04,294 --> 01:29:05,625
Right then!

928
01:29:05,695 --> 01:29:07,185
...thirty-four, thirty-five!

929
01:29:07,263 --> 01:29:09,424
Don't make the same mistake again.

930
01:29:09,499 --> 01:29:12,991
It's the one that's left who's turn it is,
not the one who's counted out.

931
01:29:18,608 --> 01:29:19,540
Hang on.

932
01:29:19,609 --> 01:29:22,271
I can see a new toy.

933
01:29:23,012 --> 01:29:25,071
I assume we owe this to the lady?

934
01:29:27,250 --> 01:29:29,912
This will make things a bit more amusing.

935
01:29:31,588 --> 01:29:33,852
The dumb suffer in unspectacular fashion.

936
01:29:35,525 --> 01:29:37,356
We want to offer the audience something...

937
01:29:37,427 --> 01:29:39,486
and show what we can do, right?

938
01:29:48,705 --> 01:29:50,536
You can join in again now.

939
01:29:54,210 --> 01:29:56,701
We were already
on first-name terms, right?

940
01:29:58,214 --> 01:29:59,875
So, Anna,

941
01:30:00,783 --> 01:30:02,307
now we're going to play:

942
01:30:02,385 --> 01:30:04,819
"The Loving Wife", or...

943
01:30:04,887 --> 01:30:08,983
Whether by knife or whether by gun
Losing your life can sometimes be fun.

944
01:30:12,328 --> 01:30:13,989
Hey! No falling asleep!

945
01:30:14,664 --> 01:30:17,861
You have to play with us,
or you'll be gagged again.

946
01:30:17,934 --> 01:30:19,765
That's not very nice, is it?

947
01:30:22,705 --> 01:30:25,868
So, here are the rules of the game:

948
01:30:25,942 --> 01:30:29,139
Georgie senior has been counted out,
so it's his turn.

949
01:30:30,480 --> 01:30:32,141
It'll be hard to change that.

950
01:30:32,982 --> 01:30:35,143
Unless you want to take his place.

951
01:30:36,319 --> 01:30:37,809
Do you want to?

952
01:30:40,356 --> 01:30:43,621
I'm sure Fatty will understand.
Right, Fatty?

953
01:30:43,693 --> 01:30:45,354
Don't call me Fatty.

954
01:30:45,428 --> 01:30:49,762
- You see, he understands.
- Get this over with. That's enough.

955
01:30:49,832 --> 01:30:51,493
That's enough?

956
01:30:51,567 --> 01:30:53,228
You think that's enough?

957
01:30:55,104 --> 01:30:56,765
What do you think, Anna?

958
01:30:56,873 --> 01:30:59,205
Have you had enough?
Or do you want to play some more?

959
01:31:00,009 --> 01:31:01,601
Don't reply anymore.

960
01:31:01,678 --> 01:31:04,010
Let them do what they want. Please!

961
01:31:04,080 --> 01:31:06,241
Then it'll be over quicker.

962
01:31:06,315 --> 01:31:08,476
Huh, that's cowardly!

963
01:31:08,551 --> 01:31:11,384
We're not up to feature film length yet.

964
01:31:11,454 --> 01:31:13,388
Is that enough?

965
01:31:13,456 --> 01:31:17,256
But you want a real ending,
with plausible plot development, don't you?

966
01:31:17,326 --> 01:31:20,955
The bet is still on.
It can't be withdrawn unilaterally.

967
01:31:21,631 --> 01:31:22,723
So:

968
01:31:22,799 --> 01:31:25,199
the game is called: "The Loving Wife."

969
01:31:25,268 --> 01:31:28,601
Although Beavis has done the counting,
she can choose...

970
01:31:28,671 --> 01:31:31,162
who will be next. And...

971
01:31:31,240 --> 01:31:32,901
using what implement!

972
01:31:33,576 --> 01:31:35,737
Do we prefer the little knife?

973
01:31:35,812 --> 01:31:37,643
Or the rifle?

974
01:31:38,881 --> 01:31:41,042
Well then, what does the housewife say?

975
01:31:45,555 --> 01:31:47,546
Hello, wakey, wakey!

976
01:31:50,259 --> 01:31:53,194
So, you're not interested?

977
01:31:53,262 --> 01:31:55,355
You don't want to play anymore.

978
01:31:56,466 --> 01:31:58,627
Beavis, show her the game again.

979
01:31:58,701 --> 01:31:59,895
Wait.

980
01:31:59,969 --> 01:32:01,300
Here you are.

981
01:32:01,370 --> 01:32:02,860
Hey, careful!

982
01:32:02,939 --> 01:32:04,600
I almost cut myself.

983
01:32:04,674 --> 01:32:06,164
Really?

984
01:32:17,220 --> 01:32:20,383
You see. It's the little knife.
You can spare him that.

985
01:32:20,456 --> 01:32:22,287
You only have to play with us.

986
01:32:25,394 --> 01:32:27,055
I understand, Anna.

987
01:32:27,130 --> 01:32:28,620
I understand, really!

988
01:32:29,632 --> 01:32:32,795
It's not a good feeling,
causing the one you love to suffer.

989
01:32:34,470 --> 01:32:37,530
But it costs so little to avoid all that.

990
01:32:37,607 --> 01:32:41,099
You only need follow the rules,
and all will be well.

991
01:33:08,070 --> 01:33:09,162
What must I do?

992
01:33:12,208 --> 01:33:14,369
You see, it wasn't that difficult.

993
01:33:15,044 --> 01:33:16,807
And we'll make it easy too.

994
01:33:16,879 --> 01:33:19,040
You recite a prayer of your choice.

995
01:33:19,115 --> 01:33:23,643
If you say it flawlessly, God will help you
and you choose what happens next.

996
01:33:29,492 --> 01:33:31,824
Or shall we carry on with Georgie senior?

997
01:33:33,563 --> 01:33:34,587
I don't know a prayer.

998
01:33:36,265 --> 01:33:37,926
You don't know any prayers?

999
01:33:38,835 --> 01:33:40,735
Not a single prayer?

1000
01:33:43,172 --> 01:33:44,161
Is that possible?

1001
01:33:45,341 --> 01:33:46,831
Tell her one, Fatty.

1002
01:33:46,909 --> 01:33:48,934
Stop calling me Fatty all the time.

1003
01:33:49,011 --> 01:33:51,002
I'll stop saying it. Well?

1004
01:33:52,949 --> 01:33:55,417
Oh Lord and Father, make me kind,
So I, in heaven, my place may find.

1005
01:33:55,484 --> 01:33:58,510
- That's too easy.
- I can't think of any others.

1006
01:33:59,689 --> 01:34:00,849
Okay.

1007
01:34:00,923 --> 01:34:03,585
Oh Lord and Father, make me kind,
So I, in heaven, my place may find.

1008
01:34:05,595 --> 01:34:07,529
No! Not like that!

1009
01:34:07,597 --> 01:34:09,087
It's a prayer.

1010
01:34:09,165 --> 01:34:11,759
You can't just drone on like that.

1011
01:34:11,834 --> 01:34:14,997
You're asking the Lord God for something.
So pray properly.

1012
01:34:16,873 --> 01:34:19,341
Go on.
Go down on your knees properly.

1013
01:34:20,676 --> 01:34:22,769
Go on! Get on with it!

1014
01:34:28,117 --> 01:34:30,881
There. That's right. Kneel down properly.

1015
01:34:33,389 --> 01:34:35,323
Put your hands together.

1016
01:34:35,992 --> 01:34:37,823
Not on your stomach.

1017
01:34:37,894 --> 01:34:40,556
Where is the one you pray to?
Up there!

1018
01:34:41,464 --> 01:34:44,228
You have to pray to the heavens!
That's it!

1019
01:34:45,835 --> 01:34:49,498
Right, and now, in a fervent tone,
if you don't mind.

1020
01:34:55,711 --> 01:34:58,544
- Beavis, can you help her a little?
- No!

1021
01:35:07,189 --> 01:35:09,350
Oh Lord and Father, make me kind,

1022
01:35:11,861 --> 01:35:13,692
So I, in heaven, my place may find.

1023
01:35:13,763 --> 01:35:15,230
Well done!
You did that well!

1024
01:35:16,565 --> 01:35:20,057
That was the trial run,
and now we're going for Olympic Gold:

1025
01:35:20,136 --> 01:35:23,469
If you can recite this prayer,
which is sadly much too short,

1026
01:35:23,539 --> 01:35:26,201
from back to front, without any mistakes,

1027
01:35:26,275 --> 01:35:30,575
you can not only choose
which of you kicks the bucket first,

1028
01:35:30,646 --> 01:35:34,912
but also, and no doubt
this will interest you more - how.

1029
01:35:34,984 --> 01:35:39,250
whether quick and painless by the bullet...

1030
01:35:39,322 --> 01:35:40,789
Careful!

1031
01:35:47,263 --> 01:35:49,231
Where's the remote?

1032
01:35:50,433 --> 01:35:52,765
Where's the fucking remote control?

1033
01:36:19,028 --> 01:36:22,191
That was the trial run,
and now we're going for Olympic Gold:

1034
01:36:22,264 --> 01:36:26,098
If you can recite this prayer,
which is sadly much too short,

1035
01:36:26,168 --> 01:36:29,831
from back to front, without any mistakes,

1036
01:36:29,905 --> 01:36:32,897
you can not only choose
which of you kicks the bucket first,

1037
01:36:32,975 --> 01:36:37,309
but also, and no doubt
this will interest you more - how:

1038
01:36:37,380 --> 01:36:40,213
whether quick and painless by the bul -

1039
01:36:43,953 --> 01:36:47,787
You shouldn't have done that, Anna.
One doesn't break the rules.

1040
01:36:47,857 --> 01:36:50,690
Sorry. You've failed.

1041
01:36:54,063 --> 01:36:56,554
Say good-bye to Georgie.

1042
01:37:31,534 --> 01:37:33,525
Would you sit down?

1043
01:38:13,976 --> 01:38:15,466
Can you give me your gloves?

1044
01:38:20,616 --> 01:38:23,107
...only it's all inverted.

1045
01:38:23,185 --> 01:38:26,643
But of course all these predictions are wrong
so as to avoid a panic.

1046
01:38:26,722 --> 01:38:28,212
But now Kelvin knows how it really is...

1047
01:38:28,290 --> 01:38:31,453
and wants to warn his wife
and daughter in time.

1048
01:38:31,527 --> 01:38:35,520
But the problem is not only getting
from the world of antimatter to reality,

1049
01:38:35,598 --> 01:38:37,122
- but also to regain communication -
- Look!

1050
01:38:38,467 --> 01:38:40,162
Now that's a sporting attitude!

1051
01:38:44,373 --> 01:38:46,204
Hey, look out, fatso!

1052
01:38:46,275 --> 01:38:47,765
I thought you were a non-swimmer.

1053
01:38:56,118 --> 01:38:58,279
Go and get the widow.
She'll feel lonely otherwise.

1054
01:39:02,091 --> 01:39:03,752
Would you mind cooperating?

1055
01:39:03,826 --> 01:39:06,795
It's not easy.
Otherwise I might hurt you.

1056
01:39:12,301 --> 01:39:14,235
So. Where was I?

1057
01:39:14,303 --> 01:39:17,795
The communication problems
between matter and antimatter.

1058
01:39:17,873 --> 01:39:20,535
Exactly. As if you were in a black hole!

1059
01:39:20,609 --> 01:39:24,443
Gravitation is so strong that nothing
can escape it: absolute silence.

1060
01:39:24,513 --> 01:39:26,174
- By the way, what's the time?
- What?

1061
01:39:26,248 --> 01:39:27,738
What's the time?

1062
01:39:27,816 --> 01:39:29,306
Just after eight.

1063
01:39:29,385 --> 01:39:30,374
Already?

1064
01:39:37,359 --> 01:39:38,519
Why?

1065
01:39:38,594 --> 01:39:41,757
The deadline was at 9:00.
She had almost an hour left!

1066
01:39:41,830 --> 01:39:44,298
Firstly,
it was too hard to sail like that,

1067
01:39:44,366 --> 01:39:48,860
- and secondly, I'm starting to get hungry.
- That's true.

1068
01:40:02,218 --> 01:40:04,209
...when Kelvin overcomes gravitation,

1069
01:40:04,286 --> 01:40:06,618
it turns out that one universe is real,

1070
01:40:06,689 --> 01:40:08,850
but the other is just a fiction.

1071
01:40:08,924 --> 01:40:10,289
How does that happen?

1072
01:40:10,359 --> 01:40:13,692
What do I know! It was a kind of
model projection in cyberspace.

1073
01:40:13,762 --> 01:40:17,095
And where is your hero now?
In reality or fiction?

1074
01:40:17,166 --> 01:40:19,657
His family is in reality
and he's in fiction.

1075
01:40:19,735 --> 01:40:22,898
- But the fiction is real, isn't it?
- How do you mean?

1076
01:40:22,972 --> 01:40:25,964
- Well, you see it in the film, right?
- Of course.

1077
01:40:26,041 --> 01:40:29,340
So, it's just as real as the reality
which you see likewise, right?

1078
01:40:29,411 --> 01:40:30,537
- Crap.
- Why?

1079
01:40:59,108 --> 01:41:01,440
Is anyone awake yet?

1080
01:41:08,550 --> 01:41:10,040
Who is it?

1081
01:41:17,393 --> 01:41:18,553
Good morning to you.

1082
01:41:18,627 --> 01:41:21,118
Sorry to disturb you so early,
but I've come from Anna's.

1083
01:41:21,196 --> 01:41:22,686
And?

1084
01:41:24,033 --> 01:41:25,694
Don't you remember me?

1085
01:41:25,768 --> 01:41:28,430
Yesterday afternoon, on the jetty.
I'm Paul.

1086
01:41:28,504 --> 01:41:29,994
Oh, yes.

1087
01:41:31,206 --> 01:41:33,037
- Good morning.
- Morning.

1088
01:41:33,108 --> 01:41:36,441
Anna sent me. We had guests arrive
unexpectedly this morning...

1089
01:41:36,512 --> 01:41:39,504
and she wonders if
you could spare her a few eggs?

1090
01:41:39,581 --> 01:41:41,071
I think so.

1091
01:41:41,150 --> 01:41:42,640
Come in.

1092
01:41:42,718 --> 01:41:44,879
Wait a minute.
