1
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,200
What's up? You guys
want to buy this guitar? $50.

2
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:24,600
-Fender Hollow Body.
-l don't play.

3
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:27,700
Come on, you'll be like Chuck Berry.

4
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:32,800
Twenty dollars. Twenty dollars.

5
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:41,000
-You want to buy a guitar?
-No.

6
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:43,200
For your brother? Your son?

7
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:06,900
Order up.

8
00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:12,100
Hey, Arnie.

9
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:14,900
-Hey, Joey, how you doing?
-Good.

10
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:19,300
-Hey, look, you want to buy a guitar?
-l got one.

11
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:23,000
All right. Then do me a favor.
Will you loan me $20?

12
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:25,800
l don't think so.

13
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:31,200
l got an idea, man. Why don't you
keep the guitar until l pay you back?

14
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:34,300
-That way you're safe.
-l'm not a pawnshop.

15
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:38,000
Arnie, please, man.
l just need to get straight here.

16
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:43,100
What you need, you don't pay for.
You got to pray for it.

17
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:48,000
Arnie, l don't need a fucking sermon
right now, okay? l need to get well.

18
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:52,200
All right?
Man, you know how it is. Right?

19
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:57,300
Please.

20
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:09,800
You're in for a real
fucking treat now, man.

21
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:14,400
You're lucky you caught me
because this is my last bag.

22
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:17,400
All right, Snake, let me see the shit.

23
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,200
Here.

24
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:23,300
-This is all you got?
-lt's enough, it's 90% pure.

25
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:28,000
Where you gonna find 90% pure?
l know a guy's got a shitload of it.

26
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:33,900
Picasso. You want me to hook you
up with him, you just say the word.

27
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Yeah, baby, here we go.

28
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:24,300
Hey, where's this Picasso at?

29
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:45,300
There he is.
My man, Picasso.

30
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:48,700
What did l tell you, man?

31
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:22,800
-You stay here, all right?
-Yeah.

32
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:26,700
Picasso, my man.

33
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:31,100
How you doing, man?
Can l get two, okay?

34
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:46,300
-Let me pay you tomorrow.
-No, man. No fucking way.

35
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:49,500
Come on, man.
You know l'm good for it.

36
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:55,200
-Pay me now, motherfucker.
-You know l'm good for it!

37
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:57,800
l'm gonna fucking cut you!

38
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:01,000
Fuck!

39
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:08,400
Give me that!

40
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:28,200
Shit!

41
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:33,200
We gotta get rid of him!
Let's dump him in the river!

42
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:38,800
His body will wash out to the ocean.
Come on, man. Help me out here.

43
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:41,200
Fuck.

44
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:08,400
What?

45
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:13,400
Joey?

46
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:19,600
Joey, is that you?

47
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:24,900
Joey!

48
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:33,900
-How did you get in, did you bust the door?
-No, l didn't bust the door.

49
00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:39,000
What are you doing? l won't have drugs
in this house. Get it out of here!

50
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:42,600
-Joey, what happened?
-l got in a fight, that's all.

51
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:45,700
-With who?
-l don't know. lt doesn't matter.

52
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:50,000
The fucker pulled a knife on me,
so l got the fuck out of there.

53
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:55,600
-When are you gonna learn?
-l have learned.

54
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:59,200
l am tired of it, okay?
l am fucking tired of it.

55
00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:02,700
l know l got to stop this shit.

56
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:07,100
-You heard it all before, right?
-More than once.

57
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:12,100
-Ma, l'm trying to talk to you here.
-Do you wanna talk?

58
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:16,400
Here's a quarter. Call your father.
Tell him you've changed.

59
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:19,100
l don't know why l fucking bother.

60
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:24,100
So tell me, what makes this time
different from all the other times?

61
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:30,400
Because the only difference l ever see
is my money or my jewelry are missing.

62
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,400
This is different.

63
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:39,400
lf l don't stop this shit,
l am gonna die.

64
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:43,000
l know you heard it before,
but l'm tired of it.

65
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:47,700
You know, if l can get away,
maybe l could just clean up.

66
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:51,300
l don't know, l'll go some
place like Key West.

67
00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:56,100
Do you remember when
we went to Key West?

68
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:58,200
Yeah.

69
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
That was a fun vacation.

70
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:03,900
l know.

71
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:12,000
The drug counselor says l'm not
allowed to give you money.

72
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:15,000
Ma, l don't want your money.

73
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:18,400
l just want you
to believe me this time.

74
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:29,500
-You don't believe me.
-No, Joey, listen--

75
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:31,700
That's all right. l gotta go.

76
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:36,500
-No, Joey. No. Joey, no.
-Ma, l gotta go.

77
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:05,800
LaMarca. Hello?

78
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:08,200
Hello?

79
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:13,100
Who is this?
You must have something to say.

80
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:15,800
Hello?

81
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:20,900
Well, l was here.
You missed a chance for a good talk.

82
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:35,200
lt's the middle of the night.
Talk to me or get off the phone.

83
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:38,300
Vincent, is that you?

84
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:42,300
Michelle, sorry.
l thought it was a nut calling.

85
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:49,900
The thunder woke me up.
You watching the storm?

86
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:52,700
Yeah. You want company?

87
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:57,300
Be right down.

88
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:43,900
l think we ought to put a hole
in your floor and get a fire pole.

89
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,700
You got a thing for firemen?

90
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:48,900
-Cops.
-Cops?

91
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,500
Good, l'm a cop.

92
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:55,800
Prove it.

93
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:58,400
l'll show you my...

94
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:00,100
...badge.

95
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:04,100
No.

96
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:17,400
Okay, Reg. l got 6:1 7 a.m.
and we're on the scene.

97
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:22,200
They had to beep us at this hour?
The recently deceased would've waited.

98
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:26,900
You got the tide. Another hour,
the tide's gonna pull him to Jersey.

99
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:33,700
Jesus, he looks like
a fucking human comic book.

100
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,600
-Where's the medical examiner?
-Late. As usual.

101
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:41,500
l'm not waiting. We better start
before the tide gets him.

102
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:47,800
No ligature marks.

103
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:52,200
-Some bruises and contusions.
-Look at this.

104
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:55,500
Bingo.

105
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:01,600
Let's see what we got here.

106
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:04,800
Guy was in a fight.
Look at the defensive wounds.

107
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:08,200
-Ones. Fives. 20's the largest in here.
-Jesus.

108
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:12,200
This is 3000, 4000 bucks.
He's a fucking dealer.

109
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:15,300
They went after his dope
instead of his cash.

110
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:18,900
Good morning.
So this is the guest of honor?

111
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:22,000
-Where you been?
-Don't give me any shit, Reg.

112
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:26,500
l had to jerk off twice this morning
just to get my heart started.

113
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:33,100
Here we are. Robert Monroe.
41 4 Seacrest Drive, Long Beach.

114
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:35,900
Long Beach: The city by the sea.

115
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:38,600
You know this guy?

116
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:42,500
lt's been a long time,
but l wouldn't have forgotten him.

117
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:47,100
This gonna be a problem for you,
Vince, driving out there?

118
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:53,200
When l was a kid,
everything was new.

119
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:57,000
-Everybody just bought their first car.
-Their first wife.

120
00:14:57,100 --> 00:15:00,300
Now, it looks like
the Serbian army came through.

121
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:04,400
-Must've been a real nice place.
-lt was.

122
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:07,500
l'm here to see Lieutenant Katt.

123
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:10,700
-Vincent LaMarca.
-Sam, how are you?

124
00:15:10,900 --> 00:15:15,000
-My partner, Reg Duffy. Sam Katt.
-Sit down. Sit down.

125
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:18,600
Putting on a little weight
sitting behind that desk.

126
00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:24,700
-What brings you back to Long Beach?
-We got a floater. Robert Monroe, 25.

127
00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:28,800
Probably a street dealer.
41 4 Seacrest. Got anything on him?

128
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:32,000
-We can do a run on him.
-Spelled M-O-N-R-O-E?

129
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:33,200
Right.

130
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:36,600
-Lieutenant?
-Dave Simon. He sits at your desk.

131
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:38,700
-Hi, Dave.
-Reg Duffy.

132
00:15:38,900 --> 00:15:41,900
l thought you'd be retired.
You got the time.

133
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,300
And do what?
l never learned anything else.

134
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:49,200
-lt's a bullshit job. lt is.
-He doesn't believe that.

135
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:53,800
Sure, there are better-paid gigs,
but l wouldn't give up my job.

136
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
Bullshit.

137
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:59,100
-lt's their favorite word in Manhattan.
-He never used to talk like that.

138
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:02,700
This was paradise.
l thought l could fool myself.

139
00:16:02,900 --> 00:16:04,400
Why did you leave?

140
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:08,100
He's got a lot of trespasses,
burglaries and assaults.

141
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:12,500
He did six months on Rikers lsland
for misdemeanor possession.

142
00:16:12,700 --> 00:16:14,400
His alias is Picasso.

143
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:17,400
Well, Sam, thanks.
lt was good to see you.

144
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:19,700
lt was good out here for a while.

145
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:21,700
-Nice to meet you.
-Thanks.

146
00:16:21,900 --> 00:16:25,500
-Good to meet you.
-Hey, Vince. Come back anytime.

147
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:29,200
That didn't go too bad.

148
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:33,300
-He seemed okay.
-Yeah. Katt's one of the good guys.

149
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:37,300
Never fuck with a family of cops,
they don't forget.

150
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:42,400
Come over this Sunday.
Marge thinks you don't like her no more.

151
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:46,000
-l love Marge.
-lt's the kids, then? Little bastards.

152
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:51,400
No, the kids are great.
Respectful. Well-behaved. Not like you.

153
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:55,000
But-- You got a lot
of love in your house.

154
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:58,000
When l go there, l feel uncomfortable.

155
00:16:58,100 --> 00:17:01,100
-But thanks for the invitation.
-Suit yourself.

156
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:04,000
You'll miss it when it's gone.

157
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:06,300
-Sweetheart, give me a cup of coffee.
-Coming right up.

158
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:08,900
-Hey, Snake.
-Spyder.

159
00:18:09,100 --> 00:18:11,400
-Want to lend me some money?
-What?

160
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:14,400
What gives you the idea l got money?

161
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:19,100
Did you hear? Some whacko fuck
wasted Picasso last night.

162
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:24,000
They cut him up. They found his body
in the city, by the river.

163
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:27,400
-That's bad, man.
-Here you go.

164
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:32,200
So l hear you and Joey
went shopping last night.

165
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:36,900
l hear Joey Nova's Chevy Nova
got parked over in Crystal Park.

166
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:40,100
At least it sounds like Joey Nova's.

167
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:43,100
Next thing you know,
my associate, Picasso...

168
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:46,400
...seems he ain't breathing
too good anymore.

169
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:50,500
You wouldn't know anything about that,
would you?

170
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:57,500
See, the truth is,
l can't let this pass, man.

171
00:18:57,700 --> 00:19:02,200
l can't let some fuck walk off
with my bread. l'm a laughingstock.

172
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:06,700
Who the hell's gonna work for me,
l can't protect my own people?

173
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:08,800
lt's about respect.

174
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:14,000
The way you're acting, l feel like
l already lost your respect.

175
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:18,900
So where's Joey Nova?

176
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,300
l don't know, man.

177
00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:27,100
Where's Joey Nova?

178
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:30,400
He's in the back, man. ln the toilet.

179
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:04,300
You're dead, you junkie cocksucker!
You hear me?

180
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:07,200
You're dead!

181
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:16,100
How you doing, Herb?

182
00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:20,900
Can't eat, can't sleep.
A good shit is the adventure of my day.

183
00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:25,800
-l got a present for you.
-When are you gonna marry that girl in 3A?

184
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:29,900
-Who said l wanted to?
-l'll marry her. You be my best man.

185
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:34,400
Only if you have a nudist wedding.
How about that? Good night.

186
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:38,600
Sprewell goes right,
fires off the three, and hits it.

187
00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:44,100
Latrell Sprewell,
with 1 0.9 seconds remaining.

188
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:05,300
-Good night, you guys.
-See you.

189
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:07,500
-Hi, Terry.
-Happy anniversary.

190
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:09,700
-Shut up.
-Bye.

191
00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:11,300
What anniversary?

192
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:14,500
You've escorted me home
every night for a year.

193
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:19,200
-l have?
-You missed a couple nights here and there.

194
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:22,100
l tend to turn things
into a habit.

195
00:21:22,300 --> 00:21:26,400
-l'm a habit?
-Yeah, you're all over me like a nun.

196
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:32,200
-What is a first anniversary, paper?
-Something cheesy.

197
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:35,100
-Cheesecake? ls that what it is?
-Yeah.

198
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:38,500
Let's go have some cheesecake.
That's a good idea.

199
00:21:43,900 --> 00:21:45,300
What?

200
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:50,800
-l was just thinking.
-About what?

201
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:54,000
About what happens next.

202
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:01,400
We spoon until you fall asleep.

203
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:05,100
Then l go upstairs,
catch a few winks...

204
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:09,200
...get up at the crack,
go to work, come home....

205
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:13,900
-Have a beer and make dinner.
-Make dinner, watch TV...

206
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:17,000
...head over to the theater
and walk you home.

207
00:22:17,100 --> 00:22:18,300
Good.

208
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:22,300
-lf l'm a good boy, we make love.
-lf you're a good boy?

209
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:29,200
-And then you ask me what happens next.
-That's very good. Very smooth.

210
00:23:00,300 --> 00:23:05,100
--in your own words, taking your time,
giving us a clear idea what happened...

211
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:09,500
...between you and this guy
on that night.

212
00:23:09,700 --> 00:23:14,600
Joey owes me money, and he's gonna
connect me with this guy, Picasso.

213
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:19,900
He's gonna talk Picasso into giving
him dope so he can step on it and sell.

214
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:25,500
We drive through this hurricane looking
for him. We find him by this refinery.

215
00:23:26,100 --> 00:23:28,000
Joey goes and says something.

216
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:32,500
Picasso pulls a knife. And Joey
goes off on the fucker. Way off.

217
00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:36,000
-l'm like, ''What the fuck?!''
-That his real name?

218
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:39,600
That's what people call him.
He drives a Chevy Nova.

219
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:42,800
What are you doing here, Snake?

220
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:45,200
What do you mean?

221
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:50,200
You're not what l would
call a concerned citizen.

222
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:55,100
-So why did you rat out your pal?
-Joey Nova is crazy.

223
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:59,200
He said he'd cut me up
if l didn't keep my mouth shut.

224
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:02,000
You'll give us Joey.
Where do we find him?

225
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:06,700
He's usually hanging around
on the boardwalk. By the old casino.

226
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:08,600
l don't know.

227
00:24:08,700 --> 00:24:11,700
Suppose we pretend
to believe this fuck...

228
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:15,000
...you wanna get a description
of this Joey?

229
00:24:15,100 --> 00:24:18,300
Let me run a make
on the Chevy Nova registration.

230
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:21,900
The reason you're here
is because you're scared.

231
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:27,100
What l want to know is who
you're scared of. You want to tell us?

232
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:36,200
Here's your change and your order.
Bye, now.

233
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:41,200
-May l take your order?
-A bacon cheeseburger and a blowjob.

234
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:44,800
How you doing, Gina?

235
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:48,800
-Fuck off!
-That ain't no way to treat a customer.

236
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:54,300
-What do you want?
-Joey Nova.

237
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:59,200
-Like l know where he is? Like l care?
-Tell him I want my 4 grand back.

238
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:02,200
Good luck.
Just get the hell out of here.

239
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:04,900
How's your kid doing?

240
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:10,300
-You're gonna get me canned, asshole.
-All right. Catch you later.

241
00:25:28,700 --> 00:25:30,400
We gotta get a warrant.

242
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:34,400
lt'll take a couple of days
and he'll vacate. Bingo.

243
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:48,200
Stinks like a sewer in here.

244
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:12,100
Look at this. lt's a shooting
gallery, for chrissakes.

245
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:15,700
-This is where he comes to juice.
-Anybody home?

246
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:21,000
-We got special delivery!
-lce. Blue Bellies.

247
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:25,400
Snow Caps. Quills. Whatever. Hello?

248
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:27,700
-Anybody home?
-Hello?

249
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:32,400
-No buyers.
-l guess not.

250
00:26:32,700 --> 00:26:34,800
l think they're all dead.

251
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:38,200
Well, let's get out of here.

252
00:26:38,900 --> 00:26:41,300
This place used to be beautiful.

253
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:44,400
My old man used to take me
here all the time.

254
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:48,700
That's the first time l ever heard
you talk about your old man.

255
00:28:51,900 --> 00:28:54,400
-Hey, Gina.
-What are you doing here?

256
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:58,200
l just wanted to come take
a shower or something.

257
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:00,000
Did you kill that guy?

258
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:03,600
-What? What guy?
-The guy you stole the $4000 from.

259
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:06,800
-What did you do with it?
-l didn't steal $4000.

260
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,100
That's not what Spyder says.

261
00:29:09,300 --> 00:29:12,100
-Spyder?
-Yeah, the guy worked for Spyder.

262
00:29:12,300 --> 00:29:15,500
And your friend Snake
turned himself in.

263
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:19,200
-Fuck.
-Yeah.

264
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,800
Fuck.

265
00:29:22,700 --> 00:29:27,300
l didn't mean to do it. He came
after me. l didn't take his money.

266
00:29:29,300 --> 00:29:31,600
What have you done?

267
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:33,800
l don't know.

268
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:42,900
-Are you staying clean?
-Trying.

269
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,700
Gina.

270
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:51,800
You gotta get out of here. Spyder's
been hassling me, looking for you.

271
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:54,700
All right.

272
00:29:54,900 --> 00:29:59,400
-What are you gonna do?
-l don't know. l gotta get out of here.

273
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:01,900
Maybe get some money and...

274
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:06,600
...then maybe l'll go
to Key West or something.

275
00:30:07,100 --> 00:30:11,300
Then l could send for you.
l don't have the dough right now, but--

276
00:30:11,500 --> 00:30:16,500
-l'm skimming at work just to get by.
-No, l didn't mean from you.

277
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:19,700
Yeah, sure, Joey.

278
00:30:21,700 --> 00:30:22,900
Here.

279
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,200
-Here.
-No, no.

280
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:30,500
Look...

281
00:30:31,300 --> 00:30:33,000
...l got this for you.

282
00:30:40,300 --> 00:30:42,500
So maybe l'll see you in Florida.

283
00:30:43,300 --> 00:30:44,600
All right?

284
00:30:47,700 --> 00:30:48,900
Bye.

285
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:18,300
Here you go, Herb.

286
00:31:18,900 --> 00:31:23,300
-Don't let the cops catch you drinking.
-One of them lives here.

287
00:31:23,500 --> 00:31:27,000
-Nice guy?
-He's an asshole. Cheap with his liquor.

288
00:31:35,900 --> 00:31:39,500
Long Beach got a positive lD
on the Chevy Nova.

289
00:31:39,700 --> 00:31:42,400
lt's registered to Joey LaMarca.

290
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:46,300
-My Joey?
-Yeah.

291
00:31:59,700 --> 00:32:04,800
Could you open up four, please?
Snake, come out here for a second.

292
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:11,100
-You know who that is?
-Joey Nova.

293
00:32:11,300 --> 00:32:15,400
-This the guy who killed Picasso?
-Yeah, Joey Nova.

294
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:20,100
-Got anything to add to what you told us?
-No, sir.

295
00:32:20,700 --> 00:32:23,100
-You stuck him!
-l didn't, Joey did!

296
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:26,800
-Close it up!
-Get in the cage! Come on, Vince.

297
00:32:29,900 --> 00:32:32,100
Lieutenant, you all right?

298
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:36,000
Joey's my son.
His mother and me are divorced.

299
00:32:36,100 --> 00:32:38,900
-l'm sorry.
-Put a warrant out for him.

300
00:32:39,100 --> 00:32:42,500
Get a search warrant for that casino
where he hangs out.

301
00:32:42,700 --> 00:32:47,600
Keep checking with Traffic for the Chevy
Nova. l'm gonna go see his mother.

302
00:32:54,100 --> 00:32:57,400
Cover the back,
just in case he's in there.

303
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:13,800
-Who is it?
-lt's Vince.

304
00:33:14,700 --> 00:33:16,600
Can l come in?

305
00:33:26,300 --> 00:33:28,800
-l'm sorry. lt's late.
-What do you want?

306
00:33:29,100 --> 00:33:31,400
-You know where Joey is?
-Why?

307
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:35,500
He's in trouble. l think he
might've killed somebody.

308
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:39,700
-You know this or you just think it?
-l'm pretty sure.

309
00:33:40,100 --> 00:33:43,200
l know a very good lawyer.
He was with the D.A.

310
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:46,700
-Really?
-l'm gonna give him a call.

311
00:33:46,900 --> 00:33:49,400
So let me get this straight.

312
00:33:49,500 --> 00:33:53,800
You walk out 1 4 years ago and
now you come back giving orders.

313
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:58,400
-Our son is in trouble.
-We don't have a son. l do.

314
00:33:58,600 --> 00:34:00,800
Nothing here belongs to you.

315
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:04,100
-Learn a new song to sing.
-You walked out on Joey.

316
00:34:04,300 --> 00:34:08,400
-Not on him. l walked out on you.
-What's the difference?

317
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:10,300
l'm trying to help.

318
00:34:10,500 --> 00:34:13,300
You came here to arrest your own son.

319
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:16,600
lf he's responsible.
He'll have to face up to it.

320
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:20,400
That's funny. You, talking
about facing responsibilities.

321
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:24,400
You ran away. Anything got too
close, you ran to your job.

322
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:27,300
Tell him he's better off turning
himself in to me.

323
00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:31,600
You think l trust you to bring him in?
You wife beater!

324
00:34:32,300 --> 00:34:36,900
You have to bring that up.
You had as much to do with it as l did.

325
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:41,200
There was never violence
in my family. Not like the LaMarcas!

326
00:34:41,500 --> 00:34:44,800
You can't save him
by saying it runs in the family.

327
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:49,400
He made a choice to be there and kill.
Like you made a choice to be a bitch.

328
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:56,900
Okay, Vince, you got it off your chest.
Nothing more to say now? So go.

329
00:35:00,500 --> 00:35:04,700
Just tell him he's better off
turning himself in to me.

330
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:20,200
Hey, where you been?
l thought you got shot or something.

331
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:23,300
l'm sorry, l should've called.

332
00:35:23,500 --> 00:35:25,300
Are you all right?

333
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:29,000
Rough day.

334
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:32,500
-ls something wrong?
-l'm just tired.

335
00:35:37,300 --> 00:35:38,900
l just don't feel like--

336
00:35:39,500 --> 00:35:43,400
-l just don't feel like talking.
-Okay.

337
00:36:27,500 --> 00:36:29,300
-Chief.
-Close the door.

338
00:36:29,500 --> 00:36:33,800
This is Commissioner Johnson and
Vanessa Hansen from the mayor's office.

339
00:36:34,100 --> 00:36:38,400
-Actually, Deputy Assistant Mayor.
-Take a seat, Vince.

340
00:36:38,700 --> 00:36:42,500
We wanted to meet you,
see how to spin this for the media.

341
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:46,100
-Spin what?
-They know about your old man, Vince.

342
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:50,600
We need a story on how the son
of an executed child-murderer was...

343
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:53,800
-...promoted to homicide detective.
-One of the best.

344
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,300
-The best.
-Of New York's finest.

345
00:36:56,500 --> 00:37:00,200
My father didn't kill the kid.
lt was a stupid accident.

346
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:05,000
Yes, but the 1 1 :00 news will be
all over this. We want to be ready.

347
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:09,300
-They'll want to know how you got started.
-l didn't kill the kid.

348
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:14,200
But you were hired by Police Captain
McAuley, your father-in-law...

349
00:37:14,300 --> 00:37:17,900
-...who shepherded you into Homicide.
-What about him?

350
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:22,200
He arrested my father and
he took a big, big chance with me.

351
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:26,700
l know. l'm just saying that this
is how the media will frame it.

352
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:31,700
After the execution, l had nothing.
That cop saved me, taught me everything.

353
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:36,000
He was the kindest guy l ever met.
Make that part of your story.

354
00:37:36,100 --> 00:37:39,200
How's this: ''Detective LaMarca
is in no way responsible.

355
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:44,200
He's had a long and honorable career
despite his father's violent past--''

356
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:48,300
-He wasn't violent. What is this?
-''--and that of his son.''

357
00:37:48,500 --> 00:37:51,200
-Excuse us.
-''He has fought criminals....''

358
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:54,700
-Something like that?
-Yeah, that would work.

359
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:01,000
l have to take you off the case.

360
00:38:01,100 --> 00:38:04,700
-l should reassign you too, Reg.
-l want him on it.

361
00:38:04,900 --> 00:38:06,900
-lt's your call.
-l don't know.

362
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:10,200
l want Joey brought in safe.
l know you'll do that.

363
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:12,500
Okay, all right.

364
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:15,200
Rossi!
You're working with Reg on this.

365
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:17,600
Take the rest of the week off.

366
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:21,700
-l don't need a week off, sir.
-This isn't a democracy.

367
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:23,300
l'll take you home.

368
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:34,800
Put my ex-wife's place
under surveillance. A wiretap too.

369
00:38:40,900 --> 00:38:44,800
He may have killed a guy. lt's easier
the second time. You know that.

370
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:50,100
Whatever you have to do, you'll always
have my respect and friendship.

371
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:53,100
l'll do everything
to bring him in safe.

372
00:39:21,900 --> 00:39:23,800
You want company?

373
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:29,900
-How come you're not at work?
-Took a few days off.

374
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:33,000
l'm not used to seeing you
in the daylight.

375
00:39:33,100 --> 00:39:35,200
l look different?

376
00:39:37,900 --> 00:39:41,500
l'm sorry about yesterday.
l'm sorry l didn't call you.

377
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:44,300
Well, we're not in high school, right?

378
00:39:45,300 --> 00:39:51,100
-l just had a tough day, you know?
-No, actually, l don't know.

379
00:39:51,300 --> 00:39:54,700
l just don't like talking
about work, that's all.

380
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:57,600
Okay.

381
00:40:04,900 --> 00:40:09,200
You got your place, l got mine.
No complications, and that's okay.

382
00:40:09,500 --> 00:40:12,900
l'm 43 years old,
l like to keep it simple.

383
00:40:16,500 --> 00:40:19,800
l don't want to marry you.
l just want to know you.

384
00:40:20,500 --> 00:40:23,500
l think l know you,
then something happens...

385
00:40:23,700 --> 00:40:26,400
...and l realize
l don't know you at all.

386
00:40:32,300 --> 00:40:34,500
You gonna say anything?

387
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:40,500
What's there to say? lt's my problem,
not yours. Why make it yours?

388
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:43,600
You see?

389
00:40:43,700 --> 00:40:45,700
That's exactly what l mean.

390
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:04,700
-What's up? l got something for you.
-How much you looking for?

391
00:41:04,900 --> 00:41:08,100
At least a grand.
l need some traveling money.

392
00:41:09,100 --> 00:41:11,700
-Where you going?
-Florida.

393
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:14,900
Really? What you gonna be doing
down there?

394
00:41:15,100 --> 00:41:19,400
Well, my old man manages
a hotel down there.

395
00:41:19,700 --> 00:41:22,100
He'll get me a job tending bar.

396
00:41:22,300 --> 00:41:28,100
One of those beach bars. You know,
palm trees. Right on the fucking sand.

397
00:41:28,300 --> 00:41:32,600
-l'll give you a grand for your Nova.
-How will l get to Florida?

398
00:41:32,600 --> 00:41:35,700
-l can't sell my Nova.
-This is all shit.

399
00:41:35,900 --> 00:41:39,700
Look, l got a silver-plated .45.

400
00:41:39,900 --> 00:41:43,000
Bring me the piece, we'll talk money.

401
00:41:43,900 --> 00:41:48,400
-See you later.
-Dude, we never close, baby.

402
00:42:29,900 --> 00:42:32,900
-Yeah?
-Mr. LaMarca?

403
00:42:33,100 --> 00:42:35,800
You Joey LaMarca's father?

404
00:42:36,200 --> 00:42:40,300
-Who's this?
-Friend of Joey's.

405
00:42:49,900 --> 00:42:52,200
-Who are you?
-l'm Gina.

406
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:55,900
Okay, come on in, Gina.

407
00:43:04,700 --> 00:43:07,500
Sit down.
You want something to drink?

408
00:43:07,600 --> 00:43:09,300
No.

409
00:43:09,400 --> 00:43:11,200
So where's Joey?

410
00:43:11,400 --> 00:43:13,900
-l don't know.
-You don't know?

411
00:43:14,100 --> 00:43:16,900
When was the last time you saw him?

412
00:43:17,100 --> 00:43:20,000
l got something that belongs to Joey.

413
00:43:20,100 --> 00:43:24,900
l was thinking l'd leave it here
with you. lt's just stuff Joey saved.

414
00:43:25,100 --> 00:43:29,600
-Kind of like a scrapbook, you know?
-How did you know to come here?

415
00:43:29,700 --> 00:43:33,600
Joey brought me once.
One day he said he wanted to see you.

416
00:43:33,800 --> 00:43:36,000
-And where was l?
-l don't know.

417
00:43:36,200 --> 00:43:39,400
He chickened out.
Wouldn't even push the doorbell.

418
00:43:39,700 --> 00:43:42,800
Just like Joey.
He wouldn't let me either.

419
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:45,200
How do you get
in touch with him?

420
00:43:45,400 --> 00:43:48,400
l told you.
l don't know where he is.

421
00:43:48,500 --> 00:43:52,800
Keep asking questions like that,
you'll have to read me my rights.

422
00:43:53,400 --> 00:43:55,500
You live in Long Beach?

423
00:43:55,600 --> 00:43:57,000
Yeah.

424
00:43:57,600 --> 00:44:01,600
l borrowed a friend's car to get here.
l gotta get it back.

425
00:44:01,800 --> 00:44:05,100
You drove into the city
just to give me this?

426
00:44:05,200 --> 00:44:09,100
Joe's gone.
That stuff was real important to him.

427
00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:13,500
l didn't know what else to do with it,
and his mother don't like me, so....

428
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:16,600
So, what do you expect me to do?

429
00:44:18,100 --> 00:44:22,800
Just, like, be his dad, you know?

430
00:44:26,300 --> 00:44:29,000
l gotta go. l'm gonna get a ticket.

431
00:44:35,600 --> 00:44:37,000
Gina?

432
00:44:39,700 --> 00:44:40,900
Thank you.

433
00:44:41,500 --> 00:44:43,000
Sure.

434
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:48,100
l'll talk to you later, okay?

435
00:45:55,700 --> 00:45:57,100
Cheesecake?

436
00:46:02,100 --> 00:46:05,000
-That you?
-That's me.

437
00:46:05,800 --> 00:46:07,500
Mom, dad?

438
00:46:07,700 --> 00:46:11,300
-Connie. His name was Angelo.
-He's handsome.

439
00:46:17,100 --> 00:46:20,800
My old man was executed
at Sing Sing in '59...

440
00:46:21,400 --> 00:46:23,400
...for murder.

441
00:46:24,100 --> 00:46:25,500
l was 8.

442
00:46:34,100 --> 00:46:35,700
What happened?

443
00:46:36,900 --> 00:46:41,800
He was a moving man. Moved rich people
into mansions out in Locust Valley.

444
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:47,900
Somehow he got himself into debt. l guess
it was bad. He had this idea to fix it.

445
00:46:48,100 --> 00:46:52,100
This brilliant, idiotic, stupid idea:

446
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:58,400
Kidnap a baby from a rich family.
Leave a ransom note.

447
00:46:58,500 --> 00:47:00,500
They'll pay, no sweat.

448
00:47:00,700 --> 00:47:04,700
He kidnaps the baby. While he's waiting
for the ransom in his car...

449
00:47:04,900 --> 00:47:09,700
...the baby gets tangled in a blanket
in the back seat and suffocates.

450
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:14,900
First murder in Long Beach,
and it was my old man.

451
00:47:17,600 --> 00:47:20,400
Just a little kid,
that must've been hell.

452
00:47:20,600 --> 00:47:24,600
You get through anything
when you have to, but it was....

453
00:47:26,500 --> 00:47:31,300
What kept me sane was the cop who
arrested my old man kind of adopted me.

454
00:47:31,300 --> 00:47:34,300
Captain McAuley, he was a good guy.

455
00:47:38,600 --> 00:47:40,100
But this...

456
00:47:40,900 --> 00:47:43,500
-...is the ex-wife?
-Yeah, that's Maggie.

457
00:47:45,100 --> 00:47:46,500
Who's this?

458
00:47:48,600 --> 00:47:51,300
That's my son, Joey.

459
00:47:53,600 --> 00:47:55,000
You have a son?

460
00:47:55,200 --> 00:47:59,900
l'm sorry l lied to you when l said
l didn't have any kids. l'm sorry.

461
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:02,800
-Why did you lie to me?
-l don't know.

462
00:48:04,900 --> 00:48:08,600
l hadn't seen him in a long time.
The divorce was a mess.

463
00:48:08,700 --> 00:48:12,200
Maggie had been
seeing this guy and....

464
00:48:14,200 --> 00:48:17,200
l don't know, l just....

465
00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:22,500
-l lost control of the situation.
-Lost control? ls that cop talk?

466
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:27,500
We fought a lot, shouting and
yelling. But it never got physical.

467
00:48:27,700 --> 00:48:30,800
And then one day, it did.

468
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:33,000
l lost control.

469
00:48:35,500 --> 00:48:40,300
l, of course, regretted it.
But we never got over that.

470
00:48:43,200 --> 00:48:47,900
On top of that, l think my son
might've killed a guy the other night.

471
00:48:48,100 --> 00:48:51,300
-What?
-l'm just trying to tell you everything.

472
00:48:54,100 --> 00:48:56,600
Yeah, okay. Okay.

473
00:49:02,700 --> 00:49:04,800
Why haven't you seen him?

474
00:49:05,200 --> 00:49:08,300
l tried at first,
but Maggie made it difficult.

475
00:49:08,500 --> 00:49:13,300
l had supervised visits with a social worker
watching. Like l was a criminal.

476
00:49:13,500 --> 00:49:17,000
Like l was back going to prison
to see my old man.

477
00:49:17,200 --> 00:49:19,200
l couldn't take it.

478
00:49:21,600 --> 00:49:25,900
-So you just stopped seeing him?
-Not just like that.

479
00:49:26,100 --> 00:49:30,900
Maggie was also doing a number on him,
so he didn't want to be around me.

480
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:35,600
l just walked away. l quit.

481
00:49:37,300 --> 00:49:40,400
Maybe l should've tried harder.
l don't know.

482
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:44,600
Why couldn't you tell me this before?

483
00:49:46,500 --> 00:49:47,900
Well, l....

484
00:49:48,100 --> 00:49:50,100
l don't know, l....

485
00:49:50,800 --> 00:49:52,900
That was me.

486
00:49:53,100 --> 00:49:57,500
With you, it's different.
l didn't wanna ruin that.

487
00:50:02,600 --> 00:50:04,200
Are you all right?

488
00:50:07,100 --> 00:50:08,400
Yeah.

489
00:50:09,100 --> 00:50:11,500
lt's what l asked for, isn't it?

490
00:50:11,600 --> 00:50:13,300
-Not so simple, huh?
-No.

491
00:50:14,900 --> 00:50:17,000
No, it's not.

492
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:23,900
l'm not your ex-wife. l won't judge you.
l never have, l won't start now.

493
00:50:26,200 --> 00:50:28,600
But l've gotta think about this.

494
00:50:31,100 --> 00:50:33,400
l've gotta think about this.

495
00:50:35,400 --> 00:50:37,200
See you, okay?

496
00:51:57,600 --> 00:52:01,300
Gina, l want you to know
l got a lot of respect for you.

497
00:52:01,400 --> 00:52:06,400
The way you got your shit together
for your kid. l got no problem with you.

498
00:52:06,500 --> 00:52:08,800
Just tell me where Joey is.

499
00:52:08,900 --> 00:52:13,200
-Look, l don't know--
-Don't! l don't wanna hear it.

500
00:52:14,900 --> 00:52:18,600
l'll tell you what.
l'll give you till 1 2 noon.

501
00:52:18,800 --> 00:52:23,000
Plenty of time to feed your kid,
whatever you gotta do.

502
00:52:23,200 --> 00:52:27,100
-But after that, you find Joey, okay?
-Yeah.

503
00:52:31,600 --> 00:52:33,700
He's a good-looking kid.

504
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:54,500
-LaMarca.
-It's Gina.

505
00:52:54,700 --> 00:52:59,400
-I need some money to pay the taxi.
-All right, l'll be right down.

506
00:53:05,500 --> 00:53:06,500
You okay?

507
00:53:06,700 --> 00:53:10,200
No. lt's 52 bucks.
Give him $60, he's a nice guy.

508
00:53:17,400 --> 00:53:20,100
-Who's this?
-Your grandson.

509
00:53:28,600 --> 00:53:32,700
l try not to smoke around him.
Sometimes it's just, you know....

510
00:53:32,900 --> 00:53:35,500
-What's his name?
-Angelo.

511
00:53:41,100 --> 00:53:45,400
-We haven't eaten. Got anything to eat?
-l'll make you something.

512
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:52,800
-Does Joey help you out?
-He would if he could, l guess.

513
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:56,800
-How do you pay your rent?
-Workfare. Flipping hamburgers.

514
00:53:57,000 --> 00:54:01,600
Until they figure out l'm dipping
in the register, which is any day now.

515
00:54:01,800 --> 00:54:05,800
-Then l'll be totally fucked.
-When did you see him last?

516
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:09,800
Night before last. Said he was
gonna get some money and go.

517
00:54:09,900 --> 00:54:12,800
-Go where?
-Like he knows?

518
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:17,700
Florida. Key West. Whenever
he gets rabbity, he's going to Florida.

519
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:22,900
Like it's some magic country when it's
only the dope capital of the world.

520
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:37,200
Can l ask you a question
without you getting mad?

521
00:54:37,800 --> 00:54:38,900
Depends.

522
00:54:40,100 --> 00:54:42,900
When you left Joey, was it hard?

523
00:54:44,700 --> 00:54:46,200
Very hard.

524
00:54:46,700 --> 00:54:48,100
You miss him?

525
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:51,000
Of course.

526
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:55,900
lt get easier, you know, missing him
after a while?

527
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:58,200
You just stop thinking about it.

528
00:54:58,400 --> 00:55:02,700
Put your head down, keep walking.
Otherwise it'd be too difficult.

529
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:07,700
Was it better for Joey,
you think, that you left?

530
00:55:08,300 --> 00:55:11,700
For a while. All l know
is l missed out on stuff.

531
00:55:11,900 --> 00:55:14,700
-Like what?
-Like teaching him about things.

532
00:55:14,900 --> 00:55:19,600
Like good music. Old movies.
Not being afraid to fight. Stuff like that.

533
00:55:23,100 --> 00:55:27,900
l guess what you want and what you
can do are different things sometimes.

534
00:55:28,100 --> 00:55:31,000
Gina, l wanna help Joey.

535
00:55:32,300 --> 00:55:35,200
You can't help him.
You never did.

536
00:55:35,400 --> 00:55:37,100
That's what he says.

537
00:55:44,800 --> 00:55:48,600
l'm gonna go buy some smokes.
Can l borrow a couple bucks?

538
00:55:48,800 --> 00:55:52,900
Yeah, my wallet is in the hall
on that table.

539
00:55:53,400 --> 00:55:56,400
-You need anything?
-No, thanks.

540
00:55:56,600 --> 00:56:01,100
-You don't mind watching Angelo for a bit?
-He'll be okay.

541
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:05,000
You be good.
Mommy's gonna be right back.

542
00:56:05,500 --> 00:56:08,900
His Pampers and stuff
are in the duffel.

543
00:56:24,700 --> 00:56:26,600
-Duffy.
-Reg.

544
00:56:27,200 --> 00:56:29,500
My son's girlfriend
brought over my grandson.

545
00:56:31,100 --> 00:56:35,800
-Can you hear me?
-Hello? lt's a lousy connection.

546
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:41,000
She's spooked. She just went out.
When she comes back, l'll turn up the heat.

547
00:56:41,300 --> 00:56:44,000
-When she comes--
-We're heading to Long Beach.

548
00:56:44,200 --> 00:56:47,200
-l got a warrant for the casino.
-Want me to meet you?

549
00:56:59,100 --> 00:57:00,700
There's Mommy.

550
00:57:01,600 --> 00:57:03,200
Thattaboy.

551
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:09,200
Who's this?

552
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:13,300
This is my grandson, Angelo.
Joey's kid.

553
00:57:13,600 --> 00:57:18,300
His mother just dropped him off.
l didn't even know he existed.

554
00:57:21,600 --> 00:57:23,700
Listen, Vincent.

555
00:57:23,900 --> 00:57:28,900
l brought your keys back. l think
we need to take it easy for a while.

556
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:32,500
Why don't you come in for a second
and we can talk?

557
00:57:32,600 --> 00:57:37,200
We gotta talk. Come on.
We should talk, you know?

558
00:57:45,400 --> 00:57:48,700
-l didn't go out to buy smokes.
-What's going on?

559
00:57:49,700 --> 00:57:54,700
Look, l've been thinking.
l'm thinking about scoring.

560
00:57:54,900 --> 00:57:59,300
-l'm sorry l took your money.
-Forget the money. Let me come get you.

561
00:57:59,700 --> 00:58:02,400
l'm gonna go away for a while, okay?

562
00:58:02,600 --> 00:58:06,500
Don't do this, you'll regret it.
A kid needs his mother.

563
00:58:06,600 --> 00:58:09,700
-Don't do this.
-He's better off without me.

564
00:58:09,900 --> 00:58:14,400
No, that's not true. Please.
l'll come get you. Where are you?

565
00:58:14,600 --> 00:58:15,600
You did it.

566
00:58:15,800 --> 00:58:19,200
Maybe l'm like you.
l can't do it. l just can't hang.

567
00:58:19,400 --> 00:58:22,500
Stay here. Or l'll get you
your own apartment. Come back.

568
00:58:22,800 --> 00:58:26,500
You're gonna pay for it.
It's a big mistake. Just come back--

569
00:58:26,700 --> 00:58:29,700
-Would you listen to me?
-Please come back.

570
00:58:29,900 --> 00:58:33,000
Joey might be crashed up
at that old merry-go-round.

571
00:58:33,200 --> 00:58:35,500
He's gonna be up in the attic.

572
00:58:35,700 --> 00:58:39,600
-You won't hurt him?
-Of course not. But please come back.

573
00:58:39,700 --> 00:58:43,600
-Please, you can't leave him.
-Sorry. You know, l tried.

574
00:58:43,800 --> 00:58:46,800
-l'm sorry.
-What can I do to make you--?

575
00:58:53,200 --> 00:58:55,300
-She's not coming back?
-No.

576
00:58:56,600 --> 00:58:59,200
She told me where Joey was.

577
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:01,500
Can you...?

578
00:59:01,600 --> 00:59:03,700
Take care of him? Can't say no.

579
00:59:06,100 --> 00:59:10,500
l came here to give you
your key back. And to get mine.

580
00:59:10,700 --> 00:59:14,400
l'll come back and take care of him.
Just let me do this.

581
00:59:14,600 --> 00:59:17,300
We'll talk then, all right?

582
00:59:30,900 --> 00:59:33,000
We're right outside.

583
00:59:33,300 --> 00:59:37,600
Yeah. Okay, thanks.
We're down here by this casino.

584
00:59:37,900 --> 00:59:40,600
-Send us some backup.
-Come on, let's go.

585
00:59:40,800 --> 00:59:44,100
-You're not gonna wait?
-Vince and l were here already.

586
00:59:44,300 --> 00:59:48,700
Let's see if anyone's there,
then get back to town. lt's late.

587
00:59:53,800 --> 00:59:55,500
All right. Easy, easy.

588
00:59:58,700 --> 01:00:02,700
-This place stinks.
-Yeah, the lovely smell of humanity.

589
01:00:02,900 --> 01:00:06,600
l'm taking my gloves off.
l got them fucked up last time.

590
01:00:09,700 --> 01:00:11,600
Holy shit, look at all this.

591
01:00:11,700 --> 01:00:15,500
-Watch it. There's used needles all over.
-l'll bet.

592
01:01:27,200 --> 01:01:28,600
Shit!

593
01:01:49,300 --> 01:01:50,700
Fuck!

594
01:01:57,300 --> 01:01:58,400
Officer down.

595
01:01:58,600 --> 01:02:01,400
Officer down, Long Beach Casino!
Officer down!

596
01:03:21,500 --> 01:03:24,100
Rossi, what happened?

597
01:03:25,300 --> 01:03:27,700
He was up there with a gun.

598
01:03:27,900 --> 01:03:29,600
Reg is over there.

599
01:03:31,500 --> 01:03:34,900
-Oh, no. Jesus.
-l'm sorry, lieutenant.

600
01:03:35,100 --> 01:03:39,000
-What happened?
-They called for an assist but didn't wait.

601
01:03:39,100 --> 01:03:42,500
You don't go in for a murder suspect
without backup!

602
01:03:42,800 --> 01:03:46,900
He said you and him were already here
before together alone.

603
01:03:57,600 --> 01:04:00,000
Goddamn it, Reg.

604
01:04:07,400 --> 01:04:10,000
One question.
Can l have a statement?

605
01:04:12,400 --> 01:04:16,300
-Chief Henderson.
-Lieutenant Katt, Long Beach Police.

606
01:04:16,900 --> 01:04:18,700
Crime scene is in here.

607
01:04:24,700 --> 01:04:26,200
Lt. LaMarca!

608
01:04:29,300 --> 01:04:31,800
Chief wants to see you.

609
01:04:35,700 --> 01:04:39,100
Okay, here's the facts
as we know them so far:

610
01:04:39,300 --> 01:04:43,700
A .45-caliber reported stolen
from a clinic this morning.

611
01:04:43,900 --> 01:04:47,100
Suspect's name is Joseph LaMarca.
He's at--

612
01:04:47,200 --> 01:04:48,700
-Wait a minute.
-Not now.

613
01:04:48,900 --> 01:04:52,600
You don't have enough to make
Joey the prime suspect.

614
01:04:52,900 --> 01:04:57,000
-l know it's your kid--
-Evidence. Rossi didn't see it.

615
01:04:57,200 --> 01:04:59,200
-l didn't see it.
-He didn't see anybody.

616
01:04:59,500 --> 01:05:02,800
-You said Joey hung out here.
-That was just a lead.

617
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:07,100
-lt doesn't prove anything.
-This is an investigation.

618
01:05:07,300 --> 01:05:12,000
l'm just saying you don't have enough
to make him the prime suspect.

619
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:16,000
We got a fingerprint match
on the murder weapon.

620
01:05:16,300 --> 01:05:20,500
l'm sorry, lieutenant.
lt's definitely your boy.

621
01:05:22,500 --> 01:05:25,700
l'm here at the crime scene
at the boardwalk...

622
01:05:25,700 --> 01:05:30,700
...where a detective was gunned down
during a manhunt for Joseph LaMarca...

623
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:35,300
...a murder suspect police consider
armed and dangerous.

624
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:39,300
They're tearing the house apart.
They say Joey killed some cop.

625
01:05:39,500 --> 01:05:43,400
-Not some cop. My partner.
-l know what they'll do when they find him.

626
01:05:43,600 --> 01:05:49,200
l know what cops do to cop killers. One way
or another, they'll find a way to kill him.

627
01:05:49,400 --> 01:05:52,400
-lt's too late.
-lt's not his fault.

628
01:05:52,500 --> 01:05:55,600
Then whose fault is it?
Did you pull the trigger?

629
01:05:55,700 --> 01:05:59,200
-He doesn't know what he's doing.
-Don't start with that.

630
01:05:59,400 --> 01:06:03,800
You choose right or wrong.
He's got nobody to blame but himself.

631
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:08,200
-Please help him. You're all he's got.
-Then he's got nothing.

632
01:06:08,700 --> 01:06:11,300
Please, help him!

633
01:06:11,500 --> 01:06:14,500
Don't walk away from him again!

634
01:06:51,300 --> 01:06:57,100
--himself the son of Angelo LaMarca,
executed for a horrific murder in 1 959.

635
01:06:57,300 --> 01:07:02,000
This photo shows LaMarca being booked
for the murder of the baby...

636
01:07:02,200 --> 01:07:08,500
...who was strangled to death while
LaMarca attempted to collect the ransom.

637
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:11,700
Marge.

638
01:07:17,200 --> 01:07:20,500
Here. Take these into the living room.

639
01:07:20,700 --> 01:07:23,700
Come on now. Come on.

640
01:07:28,300 --> 01:07:31,800
l'm sorry it was your boy.
That'll be hard for you.

641
01:07:32,400 --> 01:07:35,000
l'm sorry. l'm just so sorry.

642
01:07:37,900 --> 01:07:41,600
lt's hard to believe Reg will
never be coming home again.

643
01:07:48,900 --> 01:07:51,200
Why did he do it, Vince?

644
01:07:51,500 --> 01:07:54,200
Reg never would have hurt your boy.

645
01:07:54,400 --> 01:07:58,000
lt's just so wrong. lt's just....
lt's just so wrong.

646
01:07:58,200 --> 01:08:01,800
l swear to God, if there's
anything l can do....

647
01:08:04,700 --> 01:08:08,100
Daddy, no!

648
01:08:15,100 --> 01:08:17,800
Bree's gonna miss him the most.

649
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:30,500
LaMarca has had a long career
with this department...

650
01:08:30,700 --> 01:08:35,600
...living down the tragedy of his father's
past and that of his troubled....

651
01:08:37,200 --> 01:08:38,200
-Hi.
-Hi.

652
01:08:38,400 --> 01:08:40,900
-Where's Angelo?
-Asleep in your bed.

653
01:08:41,700 --> 01:08:45,000
LaMarca has been moved
to a different case.

654
01:08:45,100 --> 01:08:47,400
There they go. The big story.

655
01:08:53,600 --> 01:08:56,900
l don't know what to say.
l'm sorry, Vincent.

656
01:08:58,300 --> 01:09:00,700
l went to see Reg's wife.

657
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:08,400
You know, all the other cops
wouldn't look at me.

658
01:09:09,400 --> 01:09:11,900
Just like it was at school.

659
01:09:12,100 --> 01:09:15,700
Nobody says anything,
but they think you're guilty too.

660
01:09:15,900 --> 01:09:19,100
You can't blame yourself for everything.

661
01:09:21,400 --> 01:09:22,600
ls Joey my fault?

662
01:09:23,900 --> 01:09:28,600
l don't know. But you're not responsible
for everything your son does.

663
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:31,600
He's gotta choose who he wants to be.

664
01:09:31,800 --> 01:09:34,100
You think we get a choice?

665
01:09:34,400 --> 01:09:39,800
We just pretend that we got a choice.
lt's more like a sentence.

666
01:09:41,200 --> 01:09:46,200
When my old man did what he did,
l felt so bad, you know.

667
01:09:46,600 --> 01:09:48,900
l felt like l was the criminal.

668
01:09:49,100 --> 01:09:54,700
No way l'd feel that way again. l'd be
so good nobody could pin anything on me.

669
01:09:54,900 --> 01:09:56,400
That was my choice.

670
01:09:57,500 --> 01:10:00,800
But now, whether your dad
is a cop or a murderer...

671
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:05,900
...some kid's father's not coming home.
That's the real life sentence.

672
01:10:07,800 --> 01:10:09,200
Yeah.

673
01:10:11,700 --> 01:10:14,400
So, what do we do, Michelle?

674
01:10:15,700 --> 01:10:17,700
Want your keys back?

675
01:10:26,500 --> 01:10:29,000
-LaMarca.
-l didn't shoot that cop.

676
01:10:29,400 --> 01:10:32,100
-Joey?
-You hear me? I didn't shoot him.

677
01:10:32,300 --> 01:10:33,600
I didn't shoot him.

678
01:10:33,800 --> 01:10:37,700
Somebody did. l just left
the wife and daughter crying.

679
01:10:37,900 --> 01:10:42,400
-Well, it wasn't me.
-Let's meet where we watched the planes.

680
01:10:42,600 --> 01:10:46,100
-What?
-Remember we used to watch the planes?

681
01:10:46,400 --> 01:10:48,700
-Yeah.
-Remember where that was?

682
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:51,000
-Yeah.
-l'll be there, just me.

683
01:10:51,400 --> 01:10:53,700
Why should l trust you?

684
01:10:54,100 --> 01:10:58,500
Joey, you don't have a choice.
l'll be there by myself, l promise.

685
01:10:58,900 --> 01:11:01,400
Please. You gotta do it. Please.

686
01:11:01,600 --> 01:11:03,200
All right.

687
01:11:06,300 --> 01:11:09,500
-You gonna meet him?
-l hope so.

688
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:13,000
-What are you looking at?
-The van down there.

689
01:11:13,200 --> 01:11:16,600
-They're tapping the phone.
-But you're on their side.

690
01:11:16,800 --> 01:11:21,200
l don't think they see it--
l don't think they see it that way.

691
01:11:21,400 --> 01:11:23,700
-Speak.
-Let's not play games.

692
01:11:24,100 --> 01:11:27,700
-Sorry, chief.
-Why get cute about the meeting spot?

693
01:11:27,900 --> 01:11:30,700
l know what happens
if the wrong cop goes.

694
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:34,800
You got my word that nothing's
gonna happen to Joey.

695
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:40,000
Your word is good with me. lf l can,
l'll bring him in to you. l gotta go.

696
01:11:40,600 --> 01:11:45,800
There will be a lot of cops up here
looking for me. Bring Angelo to your place.

697
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:49,700
-Where are you going?
-You can't say what you don't know.

698
01:13:38,900 --> 01:13:41,300
You still watch those planes.

699
01:13:43,300 --> 01:13:44,900
Yeah.

700
01:13:45,600 --> 01:13:47,500
l met Angelo.

701
01:13:47,700 --> 01:13:50,700
Gina brought him over.
Nice little kid.

702
01:13:52,400 --> 01:13:56,500
Because of Gina, not me.
She won't let me see him.

703
01:13:56,700 --> 01:14:00,000
She says l gotta stay away
till l get clean.

704
01:14:00,700 --> 01:14:02,800
Which will be whenever.

705
01:14:06,900 --> 01:14:11,400
-l got this lawyer ready to meet with us.
-You wanna take me in?

706
01:14:11,600 --> 01:14:13,400
l wanna help.

707
01:14:13,700 --> 01:14:16,500
Did you hear me? l didn't do the cop.

708
01:14:16,700 --> 01:14:19,900
l come to talk to you,
you bring up a lawyer.

709
01:14:20,100 --> 01:14:25,700
You think maybe your lawyer could
get me the electric chair? Fuck.

710
01:14:25,900 --> 01:14:27,300
Too weird, huh?

711
01:14:27,500 --> 01:14:31,400
lf l got the chair too,
just like your old man?

712
01:14:31,600 --> 01:14:34,100
You ever think about him?

713
01:14:34,300 --> 01:14:35,600
Sure.

714
01:14:39,800 --> 01:14:43,200
-Did you love him?
-He was my father. Of course l did.

715
01:14:43,800 --> 01:14:49,100
Because someone's your father means
you gotta love him? You think l love you?

716
01:14:49,300 --> 01:14:53,600
-l don't know.
-Right. You don't even know me, do you?

717
01:14:54,600 --> 01:14:56,500
No, l guess l don't.

718
01:14:57,000 --> 01:14:58,900
You wanna tell me?

719
01:15:06,500 --> 01:15:12,100
-You know l was quarterback in high school?
-No. Your mother never told me anything.

720
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:18,900
-l used to look for you in the stands.
-l would've loved to see you play.

721
01:15:19,000 --> 01:15:21,500
You should have. l was good.

722
01:15:23,300 --> 01:15:26,600
We beat Cedarhurst
in the county finals.

723
01:15:26,800 --> 01:15:29,300
First time in 24 years.

724
01:15:29,600 --> 01:15:31,600
The crowd went wild.

725
01:15:33,300 --> 01:15:35,700
l didn't need drugs that night.

726
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:40,100
l was good then.

727
01:15:40,400 --> 01:15:42,600
You should have seen me.

728
01:15:43,900 --> 01:15:45,700
l wish l had.

729
01:15:48,700 --> 01:15:52,400
All right, fuck it.
We all got reasons.

730
01:15:52,600 --> 01:15:55,300
So you believe me about the cop,
or what?

731
01:15:55,500 --> 01:16:00,400
-Your prints are on the gun.
-l wasn't there when the cop went down.

732
01:16:00,600 --> 01:16:04,200
That cop had a name.
His name was Reg.

733
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:10,400
So who was there?

734
01:16:11,300 --> 01:16:14,600
Fucking scumbag dealer named Spyder.

735
01:16:14,900 --> 01:16:17,900
He's after me for his fucking $4000.

736
01:16:18,100 --> 01:16:21,000
lf l had it,
l'd be on a plane to Florida.

737
01:16:21,200 --> 01:16:22,800
Did you see him?

738
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:26,500
No, l didn't see him do it
but l saw him right after.

739
01:16:26,700 --> 01:16:31,300
-l mean right after. ln the alley there.
-What about Picasso?

740
01:16:32,900 --> 01:16:34,700
l don't know.

741
01:16:37,200 --> 01:16:40,200
Look, l was fucked up...

742
01:16:40,500 --> 01:16:42,900
...he came at me with a knife....

743
01:16:44,100 --> 01:16:47,200
-l guess, in a sense, l killed him.
-ln a sense?

744
01:16:47,400 --> 01:16:53,400
l don't know what happened. One minute
we're fighting and the next he's dead.

745
01:16:54,700 --> 01:16:56,600
But that wasn't me.

746
01:16:57,200 --> 01:17:00,300
All right? That wasn't the real me.

747
01:17:01,300 --> 01:17:04,300
l wouldn't count
on a jury believing that.

748
01:17:04,500 --> 01:17:09,600
This is something you can't run away from.
You can't. You can't run.

749
01:17:10,900 --> 01:17:14,700
-Do you believe me?
-lt doesn't matter what l believe.

750
01:17:15,400 --> 01:17:19,400
Plead self-defense, you could get off
with maybe six years.

751
01:17:21,800 --> 01:17:25,200
What if it matters to me
what you believe?

752
01:17:25,400 --> 01:17:28,500
l gotta take you in, you know that.

753
01:17:36,400 --> 01:17:38,600
What are you, a cop or my father?

754
01:17:38,900 --> 01:17:40,700
l'm both.

755
01:17:44,100 --> 01:17:48,100
-l'm getting out of here. What are you now?
-Joey, come on!

756
01:17:49,200 --> 01:17:52,400
Just fucking with you.
l knew the answer.

757
01:17:55,700 --> 01:17:59,600
You know, when l was a kid,
l wanted to be a cop.

758
01:18:00,200 --> 01:18:02,200
l really did.

759
01:18:03,100 --> 01:18:04,500
Just like you.

760
01:18:27,100 --> 01:18:28,500
Chief.

761
01:18:29,100 --> 01:18:30,600
Where's your boy?

762
01:18:30,800 --> 01:18:35,900
Picasso worked for a dealer called Spyder.
Spyder's after Joey for his $4000.

763
01:18:36,100 --> 01:18:41,000
Joey told me he saw Spyder in the alley
by the casino after Reg was hit.

764
01:18:41,200 --> 01:18:45,700
-Why didn't you bring your boy in?
-He told me he didn't kill Reg.

765
01:18:45,900 --> 01:18:47,700
-You believed him?
-l believed him.

766
01:18:47,900 --> 01:18:51,300
He's your son, of course
you wanna believe him.

767
01:18:51,500 --> 01:18:54,700
-l've been a cop 25 years--
-The operative word is ''cop.''

768
01:18:54,900 --> 01:18:58,600
You're not sometimes a cop,
sometimes a junkie's father.

769
01:18:58,800 --> 01:19:02,800
You're either a cop
or you're not a cop. End of story.

770
01:19:03,100 --> 01:19:05,100
This is bullshit.

771
01:19:06,500 --> 01:19:11,000
You're under oath to perform
your duty. ln this investigation--

772
01:19:11,200 --> 01:19:14,400
What investigation?
You already made your mind up.

773
01:19:20,700 --> 01:19:22,000
Peace, all right?

774
01:19:22,100 --> 01:19:24,700
Don't be playing no bullshit neither.

775
01:19:30,600 --> 01:19:32,400
A motherfucking ghost.

776
01:19:33,100 --> 01:19:36,300
-How come you still breathing, Casper?
-Listen.

777
01:19:36,500 --> 01:19:39,000
A thousand dollars for my Nova.

778
01:19:41,000 --> 01:19:43,000
Cops got your wheels, boy.

779
01:19:43,300 --> 01:19:47,200
l'm sorry, man.
Will you do me a solid here, please?

780
01:19:47,400 --> 01:19:48,500
l need help.

781
01:19:49,000 --> 01:19:50,800
Please.

782
01:19:53,700 --> 01:19:55,600
What's the ring?

783
01:19:56,600 --> 01:20:00,100
-lt's a football ring. lt ain't for sale.
-Let me see.

784
01:20:02,500 --> 01:20:08,100
This is worth like 1 00, easy.
But l'm saving it for my son.

785
01:20:09,500 --> 01:20:13,400
We'll treat it like a loan
until l get you the 1 00 back.

786
01:20:13,700 --> 01:20:14,900
Yeah, sure.

787
01:20:15,600 --> 01:20:16,800
All right.

788
01:20:17,500 --> 01:20:18,700
Here.

789
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:23,400
No, Carl, l can't use this.
l need cash.

790
01:20:23,900 --> 01:20:28,100
-You'd be the first junkie who couldn't.
-Give me the ring.

791
01:20:28,300 --> 01:20:31,900
Back the fuck off!
You lucky l'm giving you anything!

792
01:20:32,100 --> 01:20:35,100
Please, the ring's important.
lt's for my boy.

793
01:20:35,300 --> 01:20:40,100
You ain't gonna be around to see your boy.
And you ain't going to Florida.

794
01:20:40,300 --> 01:20:43,900
You got Spyder and the cops
chasing you. You a junkie!

795
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:48,400
Only place you're going is the morgue.
County, motherfucker!

796
01:20:58,900 --> 01:21:04,100
Wait a minute! What are you doing?
There's nothing in there for you.

797
01:21:04,300 --> 01:21:07,000
Want to come over and see my soup?

798
01:21:09,300 --> 01:21:11,500
Look, here's grandpa.

799
01:21:12,400 --> 01:21:15,400
This is Evelyn Hancock.
She's an old friend.

800
01:21:15,600 --> 01:21:18,600
You're a big boy, Angelo.

801
01:21:18,800 --> 01:21:21,000
Evelyn is with Child Services.

802
01:21:21,100 --> 01:21:22,600
What's going on?

803
01:21:22,800 --> 01:21:26,700
She's taking Angelo until
Gina comes back. lt's temporary.

804
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:29,400
She's not coming back.

805
01:21:29,800 --> 01:21:32,100
l can't take care of him.

806
01:21:33,300 --> 01:21:35,300
-Can l talk to you?
-Sure.

807
01:21:35,600 --> 01:21:37,300
Go see this nice lady.

808
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:40,500
l just wanna talk to him
for a minute.

809
01:21:44,100 --> 01:21:47,100
-What are you doing?
-What am l supposed to do?

810
01:21:47,300 --> 01:21:51,900
-Take care of him. You're his grandfather.
-Nice idea, but l can't.

811
01:21:52,200 --> 01:21:56,400
Vincent, Gina's gone.
You think his father is coming back?

812
01:21:56,600 --> 01:22:01,600
-This is the best thing for him.
-No, you're the best thing for him.

813
01:22:01,700 --> 01:22:05,300
-l can help you.
-You never had kids, you don't know.

814
01:22:05,500 --> 01:22:09,700
-You're gonna walk away from him.
-What do you mean, walking away?

815
01:22:09,900 --> 01:22:12,000
-Like with Joey.
-l'm not walking away!

816
01:22:12,200 --> 01:22:17,400
-That's what you told me you did with Joey.
-l'm not-- Walk away?

817
01:22:19,400 --> 01:22:21,400
Let me show you something.

818
01:22:23,700 --> 01:22:25,900
Let me show you something.

819
01:22:28,100 --> 01:22:32,600
You think l want him growing up with
this? Like the son of Frankenstein?

820
01:22:32,700 --> 01:22:37,700
''You never know what he might do.''
''Don't mention his father!''

821
01:22:38,300 --> 01:22:42,400
Call it walking away, but l'm doing
the best thing for him.

822
01:22:42,600 --> 01:22:45,600
That is not about Angelo.
That's about you.

823
01:22:45,800 --> 01:22:50,600
You told me. You told me
you never had a choice, right?

824
01:22:50,800 --> 01:22:55,200
-Well, you got one right here.
-Michelle, try to understand.

825
01:22:55,500 --> 01:22:59,000
Right now it's more than l can handle.
l can't do it.

826
01:23:09,000 --> 01:23:11,300
That's how you make a choice.

827
01:23:11,800 --> 01:23:13,500
Goodbye.

828
01:24:39,000 --> 01:24:40,400
Morning.

829
01:24:42,700 --> 01:24:46,800
Let's try to wrap this up.
We got pretty substantial evidence.

830
01:24:47,000 --> 01:24:51,000
Fingerprints are clear.
There are no others on the gun.

831
01:24:51,200 --> 01:24:54,500
Shells and ballistics
identify it as the shooter's.

832
01:24:54,700 --> 01:24:58,600
We know he frequented the carousel
and used drugs there.

833
01:24:58,900 --> 01:25:01,300
-Excuse me, sir.
-Go ahead, Dave.

834
01:25:01,500 --> 01:25:05,400
A shoe print in the blood
doesn't match LaMarca's size.

835
01:25:05,600 --> 01:25:08,500
So, what do we think?
That O.J. was there?

836
01:25:09,100 --> 01:25:10,900
Maybe Bruno Magli?

837
01:25:11,100 --> 01:25:13,900
One last thing.
This kid has killed twice.

838
01:25:14,100 --> 01:25:18,000
Don't give him a chance
to do it again. We got that?

839
01:25:29,800 --> 01:25:34,700
You got a phone call on my phone.
How come you're giving out my number?

840
01:25:35,100 --> 01:25:38,900
-l don't even know your number.
-This guy knows it.

841
01:25:41,200 --> 01:25:44,300
Make sure you leave a nickel
in the ashtray.

842
01:25:50,400 --> 01:25:53,500
Dave Simon.
l couldn't call you direct.

843
01:25:53,700 --> 01:25:55,800
What's going on?

844
01:25:56,500 --> 01:25:58,700
l have something you should see.

845
01:25:59,000 --> 01:26:02,600
Could we meet at York
and 59th Street Bridge?

846
01:26:02,700 --> 01:26:06,200
It's copies of crime scene photos
I tried to mention.

847
01:26:06,400 --> 01:26:07,500
What are they?

848
01:26:07,800 --> 01:26:11,100
Footprints in the blood
at the top of the ladder.

849
01:26:11,200 --> 01:26:13,400
We can account for all of them...

850
01:26:13,600 --> 01:26:18,700
...except for one heel from a size 1 0
cowboy boot made by Justin Boots.

851
01:26:19,000 --> 01:26:22,300
At your ex-wife's
we found some of Joey's stuff.

852
01:26:22,500 --> 01:26:24,700
Joey wears a size 1 2 1 /2 shoe.

853
01:26:24,900 --> 01:26:28,100
There's no 1 2 1 /2 prints
anywhere in this blood.

854
01:26:30,400 --> 01:26:32,300
l appreciate this.

855
01:26:32,500 --> 01:26:36,000
Well, you know,
it doesn't all have to be bullshit.

856
01:26:36,700 --> 01:26:41,100
-You born in Long Beach?
-No, Army brat. We lived all over.

857
01:26:41,700 --> 01:26:44,800
-Distant climes, huh?
-We traveled a lot.

858
01:26:45,100 --> 01:26:49,500
-Now we got a baby. l hardly get out.
-Kids change everything.

859
01:26:49,700 --> 01:26:51,200
lsn't that the truth.

860
01:26:53,500 --> 01:26:57,300
Sir, listen,
l'm real sorry about your son.

861
01:26:59,900 --> 01:27:03,800
l appreciate it. Thank you very much.
l appreciate that.

862
01:27:43,600 --> 01:27:45,500
It's more than I can handle.

863
01:27:45,700 --> 01:27:50,300
-We just pretend we got a choice.
-We don't have a son, I do.

864
01:27:50,500 --> 01:27:52,800
I wasn't gonna feel that again.

865
01:27:53,000 --> 01:27:57,200
-You think I love you?
-I should've tried harder.

866
01:27:57,600 --> 01:27:59,900
You said you never had a choice.

867
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:02,600
-What are you, a cop or my father?
-That's my son.

868
01:28:02,900 --> 01:28:06,300
Please help him. You're all he's got.
He's your son!

869
01:28:06,500 --> 01:28:10,800
-This is something you can't run away from.
-Just like his dad.

870
01:28:22,100 --> 01:28:24,400
Sorry, sir. We're closed.

871
01:28:26,500 --> 01:28:31,300
-Anybody know where Spyder is?
-We're closed, mister.

872
01:28:33,900 --> 01:28:35,300
Where's Spyder?

873
01:28:35,500 --> 01:28:38,200
Peace, brother. Peace.

874
01:28:41,700 --> 01:28:45,100
Stick the Friar Tuck act up your ass.
Where's Spyder?

875
01:28:45,300 --> 01:28:47,500
-You know who l am?
-Yeah--

876
01:28:47,700 --> 01:28:51,500
Tell Spyder l know he killed
my partner. l got proof.

877
01:28:51,700 --> 01:28:56,400
He wants to see me, l'm at the Seaway
Motel. Room 1 05. You got that?

878
01:28:56,600 --> 01:28:57,700
Yeah.

879
01:28:59,100 --> 01:29:01,900
1 05. Seaway Motel.

880
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:48,600
Here's where we're
expecting the storm.

881
01:29:48,800 --> 01:29:53,600
On our map, lots of green.
And within that, yellows and reds.

882
01:29:53,800 --> 01:29:57,200
These are the areas
where we're expecting heavy rain.

883
01:29:57,500 --> 01:30:03,400
In New York City, the storm
will move in by tomorrow morning.

884
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:14,100
You got something for me?

885
01:31:50,300 --> 01:31:52,100
Dave Simon.

886
01:31:52,300 --> 01:31:54,300
Lt. LaMarca.

887
01:31:58,400 --> 01:31:59,400
Got it.

888
01:31:59,600 --> 01:32:04,200
l want backup and emergency units
to Ocean and Neptune. Lt. Katt?

889
01:33:23,700 --> 01:33:25,800
Don't fucking move!

890
01:33:26,000 --> 01:33:27,600
Don't move a finger.

891
01:33:27,800 --> 01:33:31,700
Give me the gun.
Give me the fucking gun! Go ahead.

892
01:33:37,100 --> 01:33:38,800
Move!

893
01:33:43,500 --> 01:33:45,600
What the fuck is this?

894
01:33:46,100 --> 01:33:49,600
What are you doing
telling people l shot that cop?

895
01:33:49,900 --> 01:33:52,400
l know you killed my partner,
scumbag.

896
01:33:52,500 --> 01:33:56,500
lt was your junkie kid.
l'm not the only one that thinks so.

897
01:33:56,700 --> 01:34:00,800
You left a footprint in his blood.
Are those Justin, size 1 0?

898
01:34:05,000 --> 01:34:09,300
-You're a long way from Manhattan.
-But too close to home for you.

899
01:34:09,500 --> 01:34:14,400
You broke into my property.
l'm within my rights to defend it.

900
01:34:34,800 --> 01:34:38,300
l couldn't take the chance
he'd hurt Gina or Angelo.

901
01:34:38,400 --> 01:34:40,300
Would be just like him.

902
01:34:47,500 --> 01:34:49,900
You broke in here pretty good.

903
01:34:50,100 --> 01:34:52,600
You learn that in cop school?

904
01:34:53,700 --> 01:34:55,700
So, what now, Joey?

905
01:35:09,600 --> 01:35:12,900
Hold back and hold your fire!
Hold your fire!

906
01:35:13,100 --> 01:35:16,000
Keep eyes on that door
and those windows!

907
01:35:16,200 --> 01:35:19,300
Block that road!
l don't want one TV van!

908
01:35:19,400 --> 01:35:20,900
Right up there.

909
01:35:27,900 --> 01:35:30,700
Okay, enough. Give me the gun.

910
01:35:31,000 --> 01:35:35,600
lt'll be hard enough getting you
out alive without them seeing that.

911
01:35:37,500 --> 01:35:40,800
This is no game, son. Please.

912
01:35:41,000 --> 01:35:45,500
You saved my life but they
didn't see it. They don't care.

913
01:35:45,700 --> 01:35:51,100
-l ain't going to jail.
-l understand. l wanna help you, just....

914
01:35:51,400 --> 01:35:53,100
Just give me the gun.

915
01:35:57,400 --> 01:36:00,200
Lt. LaMarca, signal your location!

916
01:36:00,400 --> 01:36:01,600
All right, talk.

917
01:36:02,100 --> 01:36:03,600
Talk?

918
01:36:03,800 --> 01:36:06,300
What are you now, fucking Oprah?

919
01:36:07,000 --> 01:36:11,800
You got a son and a woman that
loves you. Don't run away from that.

920
01:36:12,100 --> 01:36:14,700
-You did.
-Yeah.

921
01:36:15,600 --> 01:36:17,000
l did.

922
01:36:17,200 --> 01:36:20,700
And l'm sorry.
l've regretted it ever since.

923
01:36:20,900 --> 01:36:24,700
We all gotta pay
one way or another, right?

924
01:36:26,500 --> 01:36:27,900
What's going on?

925
01:36:28,200 --> 01:36:30,800
lt's called ''suicide by cop.''

926
01:36:31,000 --> 01:36:35,300
Quick and easy.
No pills. No fucking around.

927
01:36:35,500 --> 01:36:37,500
l thought l'd try it.

928
01:36:41,600 --> 01:36:45,600
How did we get this way?
l remember the day you were born.

929
01:36:46,300 --> 01:36:49,500
Well, l remember the day you left.
So we're even.

930
01:36:52,300 --> 01:36:56,300
-l'm not gonna kill you, son.
-Well....

931
01:36:56,500 --> 01:36:58,600
Your friends out there will.

932
01:36:59,200 --> 01:37:01,000
You know it.

933
01:37:06,500 --> 01:37:09,000
-There he is!
-You two!

934
01:37:29,600 --> 01:37:31,500
Hold back! Hold your fire!

935
01:37:31,700 --> 01:37:34,400
Get the building secure.

936
01:37:34,600 --> 01:37:36,100
Give me the gun.

937
01:37:36,300 --> 01:37:40,700
-l don't want to shoot you.
-You do. You think l deserve it.

938
01:37:40,900 --> 01:37:44,200
-Get back!
-But you won't. lt's not the real you.

939
01:37:44,400 --> 01:37:48,100
-You don't know anything about me.
-l do. You're my kid.

940
01:37:48,200 --> 01:37:52,000
You're not a bad kid. You're a scared kid
whose old man left him.

941
01:37:52,200 --> 01:37:58,000
You didn't get a choice and it hurt. l know.
But you're my son. You always will be.

942
01:37:58,200 --> 01:37:59,800
Then why did you leave?

943
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:03,600
l was stupid. l forgot
what it felt like to be alone.

944
01:38:03,800 --> 01:38:08,800
You don't want to do to Angelo what
l did to you. What my old man did to me.

945
01:38:09,000 --> 01:38:11,500
-You can't.
-He don't need a junkie.

946
01:38:11,700 --> 01:38:15,900
You're not a junkie to him.
My old man wasn't a killer to me.

947
01:38:16,200 --> 01:38:20,800
When my old man left, l hated him
all my life for what he did to me.

948
01:38:21,000 --> 01:38:25,900
But all l wanted was for him to walk
in the door because l missed him.

949
01:38:26,100 --> 01:38:28,600
l didn't want to be alone
anymore.

950
01:38:28,800 --> 01:38:32,700
We all pay a price for what we do,
but when's enough?

951
01:38:33,000 --> 01:38:37,100
Because l paid. And you paid. And what?
Now Angelo has to pay?

952
01:38:37,200 --> 01:38:41,800
You can't! We got a second chance
here, me and you.

953
01:38:42,000 --> 01:38:44,900
l let you think
you didn't matter to me.

954
01:38:45,200 --> 01:38:47,500
But l swear l won't run away again.

955
01:38:47,700 --> 01:38:51,900
l'll stay with you, l promise.
You just need to choose it.

956
01:38:52,100 --> 01:38:55,300
Know how many people
would love a second chance?

957
01:39:03,200 --> 01:39:04,800
Help me.

958
01:39:20,700 --> 01:39:24,100
-Dad, are you okay?
-lt's just my shoulder.

959
01:39:25,900 --> 01:39:28,200
-l didn't do it.
-l know.

960
01:39:29,700 --> 01:39:31,200
Get rid of the guns!

961
01:39:31,400 --> 01:39:34,600
Empty your pockets.
Don't give them an excuse.

962
01:39:34,800 --> 01:39:38,000
-They'll kill me.
-lt's okay. l'm with you now.

963
01:39:38,400 --> 01:39:39,900
ldentify yourself!

964
01:39:40,200 --> 01:39:41,900
lt's okay.

965
01:39:43,400 --> 01:39:46,300
lt's okay, there are no guns!
Raise your hands.

966
01:39:46,500 --> 01:39:48,300
See the hands? No guns.

967
01:39:48,500 --> 01:39:52,400
-Get down, drop the gun!
-Show us your hands!

968
01:39:52,600 --> 01:39:54,200
-They're down.
-Move away!

969
01:39:54,400 --> 01:39:55,800
Move away from him!

970
01:39:56,000 --> 01:39:58,600
-Told you to move away!
-Take it easy.

971
01:39:58,700 --> 01:40:00,800
All right, take it easy on him!

972
01:40:01,000 --> 01:40:05,200
Listen! Anything happens to him,
you'll answer to me.

973
01:40:05,400 --> 01:40:06,700
Easy with him!

974
01:40:06,900 --> 01:40:08,500
lt'll be all right.

975
01:40:08,700 --> 01:40:11,400
lt's okay, son. lt's okay.

976
01:40:23,100 --> 01:40:24,500
Here he comes.

977
01:40:24,700 --> 01:40:26,200
This way.

978
01:40:37,700 --> 01:40:39,300
Watch your head.

979
01:40:51,400 --> 01:40:53,700
I love you.

980
01:41:32,100 --> 01:41:34,500
l want to go on the rocks.

981
01:41:34,700 --> 01:41:37,900
Yeah, those are the rocks.
That's the jetty.

982
01:41:39,400 --> 01:41:41,700
Let's go on the rocks.

983
01:41:41,900 --> 01:41:45,100
Yeah, those are the rocks.

984
01:41:46,600 --> 01:41:49,400
Look, see that?

985
01:41:49,600 --> 01:41:52,600
You see that, the airplane? See?

986
01:41:52,900 --> 01:41:55,700
-Where do you think that's going?
-Flying....

987
01:41:57,500 --> 01:42:01,500
You want to fly away
with your dad sometime? Yeah?

988
01:42:01,700 --> 01:42:05,300
Because he wants to go with you.
He told me so.

989
01:42:05,600 --> 01:42:09,900
He told me he wants to take you
to Key West.

990
01:42:10,100 --> 01:42:12,700
You wanna go?
Yeah? Good.

991
01:42:12,900 --> 01:42:16,500
When he comes back,
you'll go with him to Key West.

992
01:42:17,900 --> 01:42:19,900
Me, you and him.

993
01:42:21,500 --> 01:42:26,400
Grandpa, Daddy and you.
We're gonna go to Key West.

994
01:42:26,900 --> 01:42:28,400
-Okay?
-Yeah.

995
01:42:28,600 --> 01:42:30,400
Okay, sweetheart.

996
01:42:32,800 --> 01:42:35,600
You want to put the water
in the thing?

997
01:42:35,800 --> 01:42:38,000
Go put the water in the thing.
