The devil knows the wickedness of the city.

17
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:52,300
He knows he can prey on ourignorance.

18
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:55,700
He knows he can stoke
unrighteous thoughts in ourheads,

19
00:01:55,900 --> 00:01:59,000
and tha the can turn those thoughts
into unrighteous deeds.

over a proposed plan to turn the site of one
of the city's oldest churches into a minimall.

25
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:26,500
More trouble
for the beleagueredMetro Rail this morning

26
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:31,100
as angryBeverly Hills residents protest
the newest extension of the RedLine Subway

27
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:33,300
into their neighbourhood.

28
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:37,200
The demonstration, called outside
the Beverly Centershopping mall,...

29
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:41,100
The people I see here today
never voted for this subway.

30
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:44,800
And...

31
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:50,100
And they certainly never voted to see it
stop in the heart of this neighbourhood.

32
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,400
Hey, Councilman! Councilman!

33
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:56,300
The people ofyour district
want us to clean their houses

34
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:57,800
and watch their kids.

35
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,900
If we have no cars, how we getting to work?

36
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:02,300
These buses run every ten minutes.

37
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:04,700
- How would you know?
- How would I know?

38
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:08,000
I know this: every time
this line gets extended there's blasting.

39
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:10,800
It's dangerous, it's expensive, it's noisy.

40
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:14,200
Nuke the whole city! Nuke the whole city!

41
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:21,000
Kelly, your eggs are ready!

42
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:24,000
Hello? I already told you.
I don't eat in the morning.

43
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:27,300
The people of my district
have to provide overhalf the taxes...

44
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:28,100
Ow!

45
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:34,400
Max, clean that up.

46
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:40,500
Kelly, cornflakes are ready.

47
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:44,800
All the subway's gonna do is make it easier
for downtown's problems to come up west.

48
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:46,500
What have we got?

49
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:50,400
Gunshots to the back,
two exit wounds. BP: 80 over, palp.

52
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:58,800
- What have we got?
- Drive-by.

53
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:02,300
- County full or what?
- Must be some holiday we don't know about.

54
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:04,300
Ready, 1, 2, 3!

55
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:06,500
- How many exit wounds?
- Two. Here and here.

56
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:10,200
- Decreasing respiration and a weak pulse.
- Can I have a number 2 swab?

57
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:13,700
- Cool watch. Tag or Rolex?
- Rolex. Hubby's big on anniversaries.

58
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:19,400
Quake!

59
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:32,500
That was refreshing.

60
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:34,700
I hate it when that happens.

61
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:37,900
OK, quake's over.
Let's tube him. Give me a seven.

62
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:40,400
9.14?

63
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:42,500
9.14. Right.

64
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:48,200
Everything all clear?
Folks, I don't know what to say.

65
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:50,100
OK, you can come out of there now.

66
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:54,400
Grab a jacket.
We have to go by the office for a while.

67
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:58,100
- You told Mom you'd take the week off.
- I am taking the week off.

68
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:00,300
I'll just wait here, OK?

69
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:05,000
- I can't leave you here after an earthquake.
- Why not? I'm 13. I know what to do.

70
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:06,500
OK. What do you do?

71
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:10,900
Get in the door frame, put your head between
your knees and kiss your ass goodbye.

72
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:13,900
All right. That's it.

73
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:16,300
Who are you calling?

74
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:18,600
Anita?

75
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:21,300
- Dad!
- Shut up. I need a baby-sitter.

76
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:23,400
..not to panic. Please stay calm.

77
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:28,500
Damage from
this morning's shaker, time dat 9.14am,

78
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:32,700
seems to be confined
offender-benders and jangled nerves...

79
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:37,700
We have a non-injuryaccident,
7th and Stanley. Altercation reported.

80
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:43,300
Oh-oh, we're cool now. It's the LAPD.

81
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:46,900
Officer! How about
giving us a ride back to civilisation?

82
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:50,200
What's up?
You gonna come out or what? It's our 'hood.

83
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:52,000
You wanna tell me what this is about?

84
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:55,100
- Get outta my face.
- If I'm in your face, you'd know it, bro!

85
00:05:55,300 --> 00:05:56,200
Huh, right!

86
00:05:56,300 --> 00:05:59,100
No official word
on the quake's magnitude...

87
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:02,400
- Have we got any power failure?
- Blue Line running.

88
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:05,600
- What's the status on Green Line?
- Green Line good.

89
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:09,500
- We got radio contact with the train.
- Radio up andrunning on Blue.

90
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:12,100
OK, let's get some business done.

91
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:16,000
Epicentre and magnitude?
Who's in for a ten spot?

92
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:22,100
Vegas, 6.8.

93
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,600
Vegas. I love that.

94
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:31,800
..we hope to get confirmation of
the shaker's magnitude from seismologists.

95
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:33,600
I can't.

96
00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:34,500
I can't.

97
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:36,900
A couple of sentences, a question or two.

98
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Why don't you do it?

99
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:41,700
People wanna hear from a seismologist,
not a pencil pusher.

100
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:43,800
If I go out there, I'm gonna throw up.

101
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,900
That won't send
the sense of calm we're looking for.

102
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:51,700
- Hey, you guys feel anything this morning?
- You're off the hook, Flash.

103
00:06:53,700 --> 00:06:56,400
You weren't gonna
make her talk to those nasty reporters?

104
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:59,000
I got some stuff I wanna show you later.

105
00:06:59,200 --> 00:06:59,900
OK.

106
00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:05,200
Good morning, good morning.
How are you?

107
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:06,800
Hi, Amy.

108
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,600
- Morning, Doc.
- All righty. You ready?

109
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:11,400
You're on air.

110
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:15,400
This was a small-to-moderate earthquake,
epicentred in Palmdale...

111
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:17,300
Palmdale! Ah!

112
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:20,100
- Who's got it?
- Gobby's got it!

113
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:21,400
Gobby's the winner.

114
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:22,700
Yeah!

115
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:24,500
Get outta here!

116
00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:29,000
- ..there couldbe aftershocks that
- Get back to work. Think this is a party?

117
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:32,600
could potentially
reach the range we felt this morning.

118
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:36,500
- As you have heard, it was a 4.9.
- Yes, baby, you can go to work

119
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:39,600
because the building's been retrofitted.

120
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:43,300
- It's myjob to know that, sweetheart.
- Hello, Emmit. Hello, feet.

121
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:47,800
It is so you to blow a vacation day
for a little tremor. What are you doing here?

122
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:51,100
- Vacation means you don't come in.
- Roark, your ex-wife called.

123
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:54,600
If a dam breaks, the Mayor calls,
I don't want you saying I'm fishing.

124
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:58,900
Mayor's in Aspen.
We don't pull her off the slopes for only a 4.9.

125
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:02,500
- Besides, I'd cover for you.
- Yeah, you look comfortable at my desk.

126
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:04,800
Yeah, it was like I belonged there.

127
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:07,500
I thought he had the week off.

128
00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:09,600
Yeah, it's that Midwestern work ethic.

129
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:11,700
Oh, what is that? What is that?

130
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:14,600
- Water main...
- ..ruptured. Gas is gone, too. I sent crews out.

131
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,300
Other than that,
the phone and power lines are all up.

132
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:20,200
Thank you.

133
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:23,600
Gotta be fast, fast, fast.

134
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:26,400
- Look, watch. You see that...?
- Yeah, I've got...

135
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:28,500
That man loves to hover.

136
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,600
Yeah, like you don't!

137
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:36,100
Seismologists are saying today's
quake mayhave revealed a new fault system

138
00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:40,900
- not previously thought to be active.
- I don't care what your supervisor said!

139
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:46,100
Nobody ran a work order past me
and this vehicle is on public property!

140
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:48,800
- You gonna ticket us?
- You're the cute one.

141
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:51,500
How 'bout I tow your ass, honey?

142
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:57,600
Jesus! Get an ambulance!

143
00:08:57,700 --> 00:08:59,200
Quickly!

144
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:01,000
- What the hell happened?
- Ohhh!

145
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:05,200
- Gently, gently!
- Help's coming. Where's Danny?

146
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:08,600
Danny! Danny? Where are the others?

147
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:11,600
They burnt up...

148
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:14,200
Hot...

149
00:09:20,900 --> 00:09:22,800
A code 6 from Public Works.

150
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:26,500
MacArthur Park. Possible fire or explosion.
Casualties reported.

151
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:32,400
Word is coming in of a possible
gas explosion in the MacArthurPark area.

152
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:37,200
We don't have any details as yet
as to the precise nature or size of the blast,

153
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:42,400
which is said to have injured
a number of city workers, some seriously.

154
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:46,000
- Rescue crews are responding at the site...
- Oh, God.

155
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:51,100
- What are you doing here?
- Got a call. Said Public Works lost 7 guys.

156
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:55,100
Freak accident on a storm drain job.
They hit a steam pocket and got scalded.

157
00:09:55,400 --> 00:10:00,000
No fires, no explosions, no continuing threat.
We'll copy you on a report.

158
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:01,400
Steam did that?

159
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:03,200
Yeah.

160
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:04,700
Where's the survivor?

161
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:08,600
He's at Saint V's right now.
Critical, last time I checked,

162
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:13,900
but I'd like to notify the families before they
hear about it on Geraldo, ifyou don't mind.

163
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:19,000
Mind if I have a look for myself?

164
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:21,900
Roark,... we'll copy.

165
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:24,300
- Mike! Mike!
- OK?

166
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:31,100
Stan! Get over here.
I wanna show you something.

167
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:33,800
How's the choo-choo behaving?

168
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:38,600
All right. This is where your problem is.

169
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:39,600
Was.

170
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:43,800
This... is your Red Line tunnel.

171
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:44,600
OK.

172
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:48,700
What I wanna do is shut down this section
just as a precaution until we know.

173
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,400
Why should we look bad
because DWP blew some pipes out?

174
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:54,500
Nothing blew down there, Olber.
They hit a steam pocket.

175
00:10:54,700 --> 00:10:56,400
- Steam?
- Yeah.

176
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:59,300
The tunnel walls are five feet of concrete.
Where's the threat to my trains?

177
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:03,200
Mine.

178
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:06,800
- Can we wrap this up?
- Maybe the earthquake tore something out.

179
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
- Shit.
- Let's find out before we...

180
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,700
You're only happy declaring an emergency!

181
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:16,400
No, I actually enjoy motor sports, music
and the company of close friends,... sir.

182
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:21,400
30,000 people think they're taking the train
home tonight. What am I supposed to do?

183
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:24,500
Put on extra buses.

184
00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:27,500
It's his mess. Let him take the shit for it.

185
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:33,800
..all around me
I can see rescue workers and body bags.

186
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:39,100
This is an awful tragedy for the families of
the workers who perishedhere this morning.

187
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:42,300
..intersection of7th andAlvarado.

188
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:44,900
Bodies are spread across the sidewalks.

189
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:49,100
We're told one worker did survive,
but his identity has not been released yet.

190
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:54,000
- 170 over 105.
- Let's give him some more morphine.

191
00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:56,800
- Start another line of ringers.
- Let's cut away his burnt clothing.

192
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:01,400
Fran, look.
Steam doesn't char clothing like this.

193
00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:03,100
This is a flame burn.

194
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:04,100
Methane?

195
00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:05,900
No.

196
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:11,600
Something else.

197
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,600
The trouble was not caused by steam,

198
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:21,200
which, if you'll recall from our briefing
this morning, was our position all along.

199
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:27,800
This is such a bad idea, Mike.
This isn't OEM. This is DWP's show.

200
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:31,300
- I wanna know what's in that hole.
- Let Public Works send a crew in.

201
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:34,000
I can't wait three days for a report.
Can you, Gator?

202
00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:36,600
- Hell, no.
- OK, let's go.

203
00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:38,800
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6

204
00:12:38,900 --> 00:12:40,400
7, 8, 9

205
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:43,600
I'm the one that praised the land...

206
00:12:52,900 --> 00:12:57,200
This is Emmit Reese.
Emmit Reese to Ground Control.

207
00:12:57,500 --> 00:12:58,800
Los Angeles, do you copy?

208
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:02,200
Yeah, we copy. It's hot as hell down here.

209
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:05,300
You all right?

210
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:09,500
Great!
Is it too late to switch jobs with Emmit?

211
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:13,500
He doesn't want your job.
He wants mine, Gator.

212
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:16,600
Yes, and a company car, Mike.
Don't forget that.

213
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:25,900
- OK, we're coming up... Whoa!
- Look at that. A rat!

214
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:30,000
OK, we're coming up on the storm drain now.

215
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:38,400
This is where those guys died.
Seven guys right here.

216
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:40,400
Must have died in a hurry.

217
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:43,000
Let's have a look.

218
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:46,100
Go on.

219
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,800
- Emmit Reese.
- Roark! Roark, is that you? Roark!

220
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:15,800
- Mike, it's Chief Sindelar on the line.
- Take a message.

221
00:14:15,900 --> 00:14:17,500
You want me to tell the Chief of Police

222
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:18,900
I gotta take a message?

223
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:23,700
Yeah.
Tell him, uh... I'm slightly busy right now.

224
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,500
That's the issue he wants to discuss with you.

225
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:29,900
What's he doing!
Public Works is sending a crewin.

226
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:32,400
Those guys are idiots. He knows that.

227
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:35,300
Mike felt this was too time-sensitive to wait.

228
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:38,700
Tell him we've got procedures.
He's not in Kansas anymore!

229
00:14:38,900 --> 00:14:42,700
- You're notin Kansas anymore, Michael.
- St Louis. I'm not in St Louis.

230
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:46,700
- St Louis. He's not in St Louis.
- I don't give a shit where he's not!

231
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:50,800
- He has a desk now! That's where he works!
- You have a desk. That's where you work.

232
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:56,600
Got a reading here.

233
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:03,700
There is a steam vent.

234
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:07,600
Water and Power had it right.

235
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:10,600
Steam's coming up
through a crack in the concrete.

236
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:13,000
Tremendous heat!

237
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:20,300
Aftershock!?

238
00:15:21,900 --> 00:15:25,300
No. Subway. We're right up against it.

239
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:26,900
- Mike?
- What's going on?

240
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:28,700
Hold on one minute, sir. Mike!

241
00:15:30,700 --> 00:15:32,600
Wait a minute. I can't hear you.

242
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:35,300
Mike, I lost you. You there?

243
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:40,400
Look at those rats! They're cooked!

244
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:43,300
Damn, Gator! I'm cooked, too.

245
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:48,600
So are you. Emmit, this is no good.
Let's get outta here!

246
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:08,800
What the hell's going on?

247
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,100
Hah! Shit!

248
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:13,900
Get LAPD to clear everybody
out of this park. You all right?

249
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:17,700
Call Olber
before we lose a coupla trains down there.

250
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,400
Close off everything in this sector, gas lines...

251
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:22,300
Mike, what's going on?

252
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:25,800
Big jet of gas coming up outta that tube.
Sparks, hot as hell.

253
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,000
He ain't lying.

254
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:30,800
Find me a scientist! Somebody
that can tell me what the hell is going on!

255
00:16:30,900 --> 00:16:31,900
Got it.

256
00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:53,500
Situated on Wilshire Boulevard's
famous Museum Row,

257
00:16:53,700 --> 00:16:58,200
the La Brea Tar Pits are one of the
LA Basin's most active geological features.

258
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:02,700
Here for the past 40,000 years
a deep fissure in the Earth's crust

259
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:08,200
has allowed oily tar and methane to bubble
up to the surface from far underground.

260
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:13,100
Evidence of  the ceaseless activity
below our very feet.

261
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:18,000
The 22-storey Beverly Heights
apartment building will open on schedule

262
00:17:18,300 --> 00:17:20,200
in spite of construction delays.

263
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:23,000
That's the word
from developer Norman Calder.

264
00:17:23,300 --> 00:17:28,500
Many see the new land mark tower
as a sign the LA economy's on the rebound.

265
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:31,900
Now here's Jere Laird
with the rest of the business news.

266
00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:41,500
Wow.

267
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:43,400
So?

268
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:47,400
I think I married a genius.

269
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:51,000
Three years, four banks, $100 million,

270
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:53,400
but the doors are open.

271
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:59,100
I am so proud of you, honey.

272
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:00,700
You never gave up.

273
00:18:01,300 --> 00:18:02,400
You didn't let me.

274
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:05,400
Here's how I see our future.

275
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:09,800
We move into this penthouse,
and then you transfer to Cedars,

276
00:18:10,100 --> 00:18:13,000
which is right down the block.

277
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:13,900
Norman,...

278
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:18,500
I don't want my wife treating gunshot
wounds. I want her treating tennis elbows.

279
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:20,000
Right. Finished?

280
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:23,600
Hardly. This is only the beginning.

281
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:31,400
- I can't believe he got a baby-sitter.
- Yeah, well, I'm doing him a favour.

282
00:18:31,700 --> 00:18:33,700
A big favour. I'm gonna miss my class.

283
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:42,800
Hello?

284
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,400
Mike!

285
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:50,100
Oh, fine. A perfect little ray of sunshine
like I was after my parents separated.

286
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:54,600
Every couple of minutes her head comes
off her shoulders, rotates 360 degrees,

287
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:56,800
then she starts watching TV again.

288
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,200
It's been hours.

289
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:06,700
Well, we've got a situation here.
I'll come home as soon as I can.

290
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:09,500
We'll go to OJ's house,
then the Beverly Center, right?

291
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:13,800
- I thought we said Disneyland.
- We talked about getting my nose pierced.

292
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
Not in this life, baby.

293
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:18,800
I'll be home soon. What can I do for you?

294
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:24,400
- I'm getting my nose pierced.
- It's a nice look, especially when you sneeze.

295
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:25,700
You can't do this!

296
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:30,300
What?! You're talking about 10,000 customers
with no cooking and no heat.

297
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:32,600
- Gas will be restored once it's safe.
- When?

298
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:35,300
You're talking about
sending a crew to every house

299
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:38,900
to turn on every damn pilot.
This could take weeks, if not more.

300
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:41,400
Excuse me just one second, please.

301
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:44,300
- Having fun yet?
- I'm starting to miss the Mississippi.

302
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:47,900
- The mud, floods?
- Mike, you have a call on your private line.

303
00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:51,200
That'll be my girl wanting a tattoo.
Help me with this guy.

304
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:54,500
- How you doing? Oh, Wendy.
- Why did you leave Kelly alone?

305
00:19:54,700 --> 00:19:58,100
- Pulling one of your usual stunts.
- What? It was an earthquake.

306
00:19:58,300 --> 00:20:01,500
- She hates earthquakes. She's only 13.
- Nobody likes an earthquake.

307
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:04,900
- She's been alone...
- She has not. I left her with a baby-sitter.

308
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:06,300
- Who?
- A neighbour.

309
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:09,600
How's she supposed to know
what to do if there's another earthquake?

310
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:12,600
- Kelly knows what to do...
- You never change, Mike.

311
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:15,200
Hello? Hello?

312
00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:20,900
Phone went dead.

313
00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:25,900
Yeah, they been doing that all over the city.
I'll get a crew out right away.

314
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:29,600
Why not do more underground blasting
to see if there's a fault line?

315
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:31,800
- No, let's do it your way.
- My way?

316
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:35,700
- We'll empty every building over two storeys.
- God, you're a geek.

317
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,700
- Mike, Emmit.
- You're a geek.

318
00:20:37,900 --> 00:20:39,500
Nice shirt, Stan.

319
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:42,000
You Roark? Amy Barnes.

320
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,800
- Hi.
- I'm from CIGS. Nice to meet you.

321
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:48,400
Careful not to disagree
with anything Dr Barnes says.

322
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:52,300
Would you give it a rest? All we said was
Cahuenga was geologically unstable.

323
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:55,800
- The whole city is.
- That's why we don't want tunnels blown up.

324
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:59,200
Thanks for coming on short notice,
but save the fight for later.

325
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:01,400
Sure. Two o'clock good for you?

326
00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:05,600
- Huh?
- Go ahead. Encourage her.

327
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:10,300
Dr Barnes, can you tell me
what's under MacArthur Park?

328
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:12,000
Not with any certainty, no,

329
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:14,100
- That's a shock.
- but l...

330
00:21:14,300 --> 00:21:16,800
We ran trains through all day. No incidents.

331
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:21,600
This analysis from the guys
who collapsed Hollywood Boulevard.

332
00:21:21,900 --> 00:21:25,800
My engineers were there - no demonstrable
risk. You got conflicting evidence?

333
00:21:26,100 --> 00:21:28,900
Some reason to strand passengers?
I'm all ears.

334
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,700
Until then, we stay on schedule.

335
00:21:31,900 --> 00:21:33,700
I'm sorry, Mike.

336
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:36,900
Oh, lah!

337
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,700
He's gotta change his nicotine patch.

338
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:42,800
- So?
- So.

339
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:49,200
So? How do I find out
what's underneath MacArthur Park?

340
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:51,900
..low-grade evacuation ofMacArthurPark.

341
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:56,200
City officials won'tsayif
it has anything to do with the deaths today

342
00:21:56,300 --> 00:21:58,100
of those seven public workers.

343
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:03,000
Take a look at this.

344
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:05,200
OK. Um, what am I looking at?

345
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:09,700
That lake was 62 degrees yesterday.
Today it's up to 68.

346
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:12,500
- Yeah, it's a sunny day.
- It is lovely, isn't it?

347
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:18,300
It takes a geological event to heat a million
gallons ofwater by six degrees in 12 hours.

348
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:20,100
What is a geological event?

349
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:25,400
I'm sure you're aware of this,
that our continents sit on tectonic plates.

350
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:28,300
- Great big rafts on an ocean of molten rock.
- Yeah.

351
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:32,800
When they shift, like they did this morning,
we get an earthquake. OK?

352
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,900
Yeah.

353
00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:38,800
Same mechanism
can sometimes open a fissure, sometimes.

354
00:22:39,100 --> 00:22:43,700
Magma can find
one of those fissures and rise up through it.

355
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:44,900
What's magma?

356
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:48,300
- Lava.
- Lava? Uh, here in LA?

357
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:51,100
It's one of several possibilities.

358
00:22:52,300 --> 00:22:54,500
It is unlikely, but it is a possibility.

359
00:22:54,700 --> 00:22:57,100
We have a history of that
in the downtown area?

360
00:22:57,300 --> 00:23:02,300
Paracutin, 1943, a Mexican farmer
sees smoke coming out of his cornfield.

361
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:05,400
A week later there was a volcano 1,000ft high.

362
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:09,000
There's no history of anything
until it happens, then there is.

363
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:11,800
Well, thanks, ladies.

364
00:23:11,900 --> 00:23:13,600
Um,

365
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:15,600
enjoy your day in the park.

366
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:21,300
- Ooh, yeah, that was subtle.
- What? You want me to humour him?

367
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:24,600
He asked us for a hypothesis.
You have a better one?

368
00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:26,200
It's lava.

369
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:27,300
Lava, hm.

370
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:30,500
Hey, hey, that's me!
My God, I'm gonna call my mom.

371
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:32,900
- Uh-huh.
- I'm on the TV, man!

372
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:35,400
Excuse me.

373
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:37,400
You invited us, remember?

374
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:41,100
You want me to call Olber
and tell him the demonstrable risk is lava?

375
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:44,700
- Just give me time to do my work.
- Cos a lake went up a few degrees?!

376
00:23:44,900 --> 00:23:48,200
No, because seven men baked to death
and nobody knows why.

377
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:50,200
MTA does not answer to the city.

378
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:53,600
I cannot go to the mat with them
unless you know something.

379
00:23:53,900 --> 00:23:55,200
I do know something,

380
00:23:55,300 --> 00:23:57,000
just not with any certainty.

381
00:23:58,500 --> 00:23:59,900
Is that the company line?

382
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,400
I'm a scientist. Certainty is a big word.

383
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:06,200
I need time to collect my data.
I've gotta get down there and get samples.

384
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:08,200
- I can't let you do that.
- Why not?

385
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:10,400
It is too dangerous.

386
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:11,600
That's why.

387
00:24:12,300 --> 00:24:14,300
I'm sorry.

388
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:23,900
Shit.

389
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,000
What did he say?

390
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:28,000
Oh, it's too dangerous.

391
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:31,700
It's man's work and you're girlies.
I can't let you go down there.

392
00:24:31,900 --> 00:24:34,100
- He likes you. I can tell.
- He's OK.

393
00:24:34,300 --> 00:24:39,500
In a macho, controlling, "suspicious of
anyone not from his home town" kinda way.

394
00:24:39,900 --> 00:24:41,900
So you like him. This is good.

395
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:45,400
We've got to go down there.

396
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:48,500
I don't see how we can.
This place is swarming with cops.

397
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:49,600
Yeah.

398
00:24:49,900 --> 00:24:53,000
Let's do it in the morning
before the cops come on duty.

399
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:55,500
All right. I'll pick you up at four.

400
00:24:55,700 --> 00:24:58,500
Four it is. Bring coffee. What have you got?

401
00:24:58,700 --> 00:25:00,700
More harmonic tremors.

402
00:25:26,300 --> 00:25:28,800
Good morning. It'sjustafter5.10.

403
00:25:28,900 --> 00:25:31,700
Didn't take long
to get ourfirstalert this morning.

404
00:25:31,900 --> 00:25:37,000
A jack-knifed truck on the westboundside
of the 10 is spreading tomatoes everywhere.

405
00:25:37,300 --> 00:25:38,500
One lane open...

406
00:26:19,300 --> 00:26:21,100
Wow.

407
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:24,800
Earthlings, we come in peace.

408
00:26:27,700 --> 00:26:31,200
God, these suits weigh a ton.
I feel like I'm wearing a car.

409
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:32,900
Hey, look at this.

410
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,100
- What's that?
- Looks like sulphur.

411
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:37,600
I can't smell it.

412
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:41,600
- Ah, shit! My flashlight's going out.
- It's everywhere.

413
00:26:41,900 --> 00:26:44,700
Could be traces of magnesium, nickel.
What d'you think?

414
00:26:44,900 --> 00:26:47,200
Take some samples. That's how we'll find out.

415
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:50,300
My battery's dead. Hold on a sec.

416
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:52,200
Hey?

417
00:26:55,100 --> 00:26:57,200
What? What you got?

418
00:27:00,700 --> 00:27:03,100
I don't know.

419
00:27:45,100 --> 00:27:47,100
Daddy!

420
00:27:48,100 --> 00:27:49,000
Kelly, baby!

421
00:27:49,100 --> 00:27:50,100
Kelly!

422
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:53,500
Dad!

423
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:56,600
Hang on, baby!

424
00:27:57,300 --> 00:28:00,300
Come on, sweetie.
Back! Get under the door frame.

425
00:28:03,900 --> 00:28:04,900
Oh, God!

426
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:22,700
Rachel?

427
00:28:24,100 --> 00:28:26,100
Amy! Argh!

428
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:30,000
Help! I've got...

429
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:32,000
Amy! Amy!

430
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,300
Rachel!

431
00:28:33,500 --> 00:28:35,000
Give me your hand!

432
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:39,100
- Oh, God. Come on!
- Help!

433
00:28:41,300 --> 00:28:44,100
- Someone help me!
- I'm burning up!

434
00:28:44,300 --> 00:28:47,400
I'm burning up! My legs are burning!

435
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:49,100
Hold on, Rachel!

436
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:16,800
Oh, b...

437
00:29:18,300 --> 00:29:20,800
How 'bout that wake-up call, everybody?

438
00:29:21,100 --> 00:29:23,800
OK, we have phone lines. Phone lines are up.

439
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,700
Generator's switching.

440
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:30,200
Emergency power's up.
What you got coming in, Phil?

441
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:31,900
I got...

442
00:29:32,100 --> 00:29:34,900
- Katie, DWP?
- DWP - I'm doing that right now.

443
00:29:35,100 --> 00:29:38,200
- Anybody seen Billy?
- He's stuck on the 10. He's not in yet.

444
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,200
Listen up, people.

445
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:49,800
I want a meeting of all department heads
in exactly five minutes.

446
00:29:50,100 --> 00:29:51,800
That's a very cool hat, Emmit.

447
00:29:51,900 --> 00:29:55,700
Thanks. Your wife rolled over
and said the same thing to me this morning.

448
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,900
- Hello.
- That's a pink slip.

449
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,200
Any more quips, or can we work this thing?

450
00:30:00,500 --> 00:30:04,300
Like you, we here at the Channel 10
newsroom felt that big jolt this morning.

451
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:06,500
It was a powerful earthquake.

452
00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:09,900
We're having trouble
contacting emergency officials...

453
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:12,700
Put your seat belt on, honey. Remember?

454
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:20,600
That's OK, baby. There you go.

455
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:25,300
I wanna go home.

456
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:28,300
We're going to
the safest room in town, I promise.

457
00:30:29,500 --> 00:30:31,200
- Operations.
- Yes, this is Roark.

458
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:33,200
- Got Roark, line one.
- Got him.

459
00:30:33,300 --> 00:30:38,000
Mike, listen. There's no reports of damage yet
to any hospitals, but 911 is off the hook.

460
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:42,600
- ATSAC's reporting all freeways are clear.
- We got good news. All freeways are clear.

461
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,100
I want you to get all helicopters up now.

462
00:30:45,100 --> 00:30:48,200
Bob, we need pictures.
I need those choppers in the air now.

463
00:30:48,500 --> 00:30:51,700
I'm heading east on Wilshire.
We're coming up on the Tar Pits.

464
00:30:51,900 --> 00:30:55,600
Poles are all up, but there's no light.
A lotta haze here.

465
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:57,600
Let me in there, Brian.

466
00:30:57,600 --> 00:31:01,900
Yeah, looks like
power's down everywhere in the city.

467
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:03,600
How'd you get in so fast?

468
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:06,200
Get in? Come on, Boss,
you know I sleep on your desk.

469
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:07,800
Disaster is my life.

470
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:12,400
He's kidding, right?

471
00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:18,000
It's too early to hear from
the California lnstitute of Geological Studies...

472
00:31:21,700 --> 00:31:22,800
Dad!

473
00:31:25,100 --> 00:31:26,600
Hold it. Wh-what was that?

474
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:30,600
That something on your end, Mike?

475
00:31:37,300 --> 00:31:39,600
- Mike, come in. What's going on?
- I got Burbank up.

476
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:47,000
Daddy, what is this?

477
00:31:47,100 --> 00:31:48,400
I don't know, baby.

478
00:31:48,500 --> 00:31:49,300
Argh!

479
00:32:04,300 --> 00:32:05,000
Mike, come on!

480
00:32:40,700 --> 00:32:43,500
- We're gonna die!
- No, we're not. I need both hands!

481
00:32:43,700 --> 00:32:47,500
Emmit, what's the nearest fire station
to Wilshire and Stanley?

482
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:49,200
What you looking at, Mike?

483
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:52,500
Mike? Mike, come in. What's going on?

484
00:32:53,100 --> 00:32:55,700
Fire! Heavy! Underground and structural!

485
00:32:55,900 --> 00:33:00,700
There's smoke coming from the Tar Pits
and something like meteors coming out.

486
00:33:00,900 --> 00:33:02,600
Sounded like you said "meteors"?

487
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:03,800
Look out!

488
00:33:05,100 --> 00:33:08,500
There's bombs. Emmit,
get hold of that geologist, Amy Barnes.

489
00:33:10,500 --> 00:33:12,400
- You have Amy Barnes, Katie?
- Check again.

490
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:16,200
- No.
- We're looking. Nobody knows where she is.

491
00:33:33,300 --> 00:33:35,100
Goddammit!

492
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:09,400
- Where are we?
- Power failure on all the lines.

493
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:11,600
Contact with the trains?

494
00:34:11,700 --> 00:34:13,900
All but one. I think we got a problem.

495
00:34:14,100 --> 00:34:17,400
Number four train westbound
on the Red Line at MacArthur Park.

496
00:34:17,700 --> 00:34:20,900
Temperature on board
reached 20 degrees above normal.

497
00:34:21,100 --> 00:34:22,900
It's still going up.

498
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:31,600
What d'you wanna do, Stan?

499
00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:36,900
I'm going down there. Get a team together.

500
00:34:47,500 --> 00:34:50,600
- What happened?
- Is everybody OK in here?

501
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:54,600
- How you doin'? What's happening?
- Fine. I think we had an earthquake.

502
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:55,900
- Earthquake?
- Yeah. You OK?

503
00:34:56,100 --> 00:34:58,000
- What's causing the heat?
- I don't know.

504
00:34:58,200 --> 00:35:02,600
- Hey, I'll help you.
- No. Stay where you are. Nobody move.

505
00:35:02,900 --> 00:35:04,600
Why is it so hot in here?

506
00:35:04,700 --> 00:35:06,800
- I'll try and open a door.
- I cannot breathe.

507
00:35:12,100 --> 00:35:16,000
The damage is pretty widespread.
A number of fires are breaking out...

508
00:35:16,300 --> 00:35:19,000
Refinery info's coming in. I got Marty on that.

509
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:23,400
Hyperion's got no damage.
We're still waiting on Tillman Reclamation.

510
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:25,300
Call DWP and stay on it.

511
00:35:25,500 --> 00:35:27,000
Yes, Chief?

512
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:28,700
- Roark!
- No, Reese, sir.

513
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:30,800
- Where's Roark?
- He's on his way.

514
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:34,500
Gonna be delayed. My car's stuck
behind my gate cos we have no damn power!

515
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:38,100
Yeah, I got it. "No damn power".
Very good. Reese out.

516
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:40,400
Jerk.

517
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:48,500
- Lisa, get me a bottle and a half of aspirin...
- Staffis caughtin traffic due to the quake.

518
00:35:49,300 --> 00:35:52,300
This is KNX, continuing
our live coverage of today's quake.

519
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:55,200
A situation's developing in Wilshire.

520
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:59,000
Our Bob Davis is there now,
reporting from his car. Bob?

521
00:35:59,300 --> 00:36:03,100
Mitch, I'm approaching the scene now.
There's ash falling everywhere,

522
00:36:03,300 --> 00:36:05,300
almost looks like a grey snow.

523
00:36:05,500 --> 00:36:08,300
Several buildings are burning out of control.

524
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:12,400
It began a few minutes after the quake,
started by an undetermined source.

525
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:15,800
There was an explosion,
breaking windows, then flames.

526
00:36:16,100 --> 00:36:18,900
Bob, could it be a ruptured gas line?

527
00:36:19,100 --> 00:36:23,800
No. It sounded like something
just slammed into one of the buildings.

528
00:36:38,700 --> 00:36:41,700
Calm down.
The fire department's on its way.

529
00:36:41,900 --> 00:36:44,100
Put some pressure on that right away.

530
00:36:44,300 --> 00:36:46,100
Emmit! It's a mess here. Can you hear me?

531
00:36:46,300 --> 00:36:50,800
I need a traffic perimeter for three blocks
in every direction round Wilshire and Stanley.

532
00:36:51,100 --> 00:36:52,100
OK, I'm on it, Mike.

533
00:36:52,300 --> 00:36:57,500
17 is down. 17's engine is down.
Wilshire and Curzon. Wilshire and Curzon.

534
00:36:57,800 --> 00:37:02,500
..several outbreaks of looting
following this morning's strong quake.

535
00:37:02,700 --> 00:37:08,700
These pictures just coming in to the Channel
10 newsroom verify the looting is going on.

536
00:37:09,100 --> 00:37:14,400
We are now hearing that the National Guard
has been activated and is on its way to LA...

537
00:38:01,100 --> 00:38:02,900
Stay with me. You still with me?

538
00:38:03,100 --> 00:38:04,300
It's gonna be OK.

539
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:06,500
We've got help on the way.

540
00:38:06,700 --> 00:38:09,100
Don't move, sweetheart. You'll be safe here.

541
00:38:09,300 --> 00:38:12,800
- You're leaving me here?
- No, just going over there.

542
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:16,500
I'll be right back.
You'll be able to see me the whole time.

543
00:38:16,700 --> 00:38:19,800
If you get scared,
you honk that horn, OK?

544
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:29,400
- Mitch, I'm at the Tar Pits...
- Get outta here!

545
00:38:29,700 --> 00:38:31,400
- Don't touch that man!
- Watch out!

546
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:34,800
Don't touch that man, ma'am.
The ambulances are on their way.

547
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:39,300
I'm a doctor. He has a skull fracture.
The other man has a compound structure.

548
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:41,200
Can you get him off the street

549
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:45,000
and see if there's anything
in that fire truck we could use as a splint.

550
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:48,000
There are fires right next to me here.

551
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:49,500
There's a man in the truck.

552
00:38:49,700 --> 00:38:51,900
Help! Help!

553
00:38:52,100 --> 00:38:53,800
Get me outta here!

554
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,600
Help!

555
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:59,600
It's getting harder and harder
to hear anything. The roar is constant.

556
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:02,200
It's loud. I can barely hear myself think.

557
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:08,400
There's steam going up from manholes
and all I hear is just this roaring sound...

558
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:00,800
Oh, my God!

559
00:40:15,100 --> 00:40:16,100
Mitch...

560
00:40:17,300 --> 00:40:21,100
Mitch, I don't know how to describe this,
but the Tar Pits are on fire

561
00:40:21,300 --> 00:40:23,700
and are spilling out
on to Wilshire Boulevard.

562
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:27,200
It's coming right up out of the ground itself.

563
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:30,800
It's as if the tar caught fire,
melted and somehow expanded.

564
00:40:31,100 --> 00:40:34,200
- The downed fire truck is still on its side,
- Help!

565
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:37,500
- injured firefighters in need of medical help.
- Hang on!

566
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:40,000
Rescue personnel are starting to arrive.

567
00:40:40,100 --> 00:40:44,500
I know this sounds crazy, but it looks like
volcanic lava pouring onto the street.

568
00:40:51,700 --> 00:40:53,000
Dad!

569
00:40:53,100 --> 00:40:55,300
Kelly.

570
00:41:12,200 --> 00:41:13,700
Ah!

571
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:16,100
Dad, hurry! My leg, it's burning!

572
00:41:18,500 --> 00:41:22,300
Stay calm, don't panic.
We'll get you out of here. Come on.

573
00:41:30,700 --> 00:41:34,100
- OK, baby, here we go. You're gonna be fine.
- Ah! Look out!

574
00:41:35,600 --> 00:41:37,500
Dad, your feet!

575
00:41:37,700 --> 00:41:39,700
Don't worry. Look, we're gonna jump.

576
00:41:39,900 --> 00:41:41,600
All right?

577
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:42,900
Here we go.

578
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:45,700
We're gonna be fine. OK?

579
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:07,000
There seems to be a downed...

580
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:11,400
- It seems to be a fireman in the truck.
- Driver still inside! Somebody get him out!

581
00:42:11,700 --> 00:42:13,200
Get me outta here!

582
00:42:13,500 --> 00:42:16,600
I can't move! Help!

583
00:42:16,600 --> 00:42:21,200
- Give me your arm! Your arm!
- Get me outta here! Get me outta here!

584
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:27,600
My God, two firemen just burned alive!

585
00:42:27,800 --> 00:42:30,300
This is horrible... horrible!

586
00:42:36,200 --> 00:42:37,200
Get those out!

587
00:42:37,300 --> 00:42:42,500
They're dragging other firemen off the street
now in an effort to save their lives.

588
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:45,300
- Watch his left leg.
- Somebody give me a hand!

589
00:42:45,400 --> 00:42:49,600
All the suffering and human carnage
alongside incredible bravery...

590
00:42:49,900 --> 00:42:54,600
Pull back. Pull back.
We gotta get more units here.

591
00:43:01,800 --> 00:43:02,900
Watch out for his leg.

592
00:43:04,500 --> 00:43:07,100
This girl has a burn on her leg.
Can you help her, too?

593
00:43:07,300 --> 00:43:10,700
I'm taking these men to Cedars.
You want me to take her, too?

594
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:12,000
Dad!

595
00:43:16,100 --> 00:43:17,800
Don't worry, darling. You'll be OK.

596
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:21,400
Stay calm. Give me that telephone!

597
00:43:21,600 --> 00:43:27,100
That was a large truck, and now it's just
a huge fireball burning out of control.

598
00:43:27,500 --> 00:43:29,600
Emmit, we're at level one here.

599
00:43:29,700 --> 00:43:35,500
I want you to have CHP close all off-ramps
on the 10 at La Brea, La Cienega, Fairfax

600
00:43:35,900 --> 00:43:39,300
and bump that traffic perimeter
to ten blocks away from the Tar Pits.

601
00:43:39,600 --> 00:43:42,100
- Got it. What...
- I will give details later,

602
00:43:42,300 --> 00:43:43,700
just get it done!

603
00:43:43,800 --> 00:43:46,500
Get some hoses
on those trees up there, fellas.

604
00:43:46,600 --> 00:43:50,400
Turn the traffic round on Wilshire.
Back up, get outta here.

605
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:52,400
- You're OEM, right?
- Yeah.

606
00:43:52,600 --> 00:43:54,800
You need to be here. She doesn't.

607
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:56,600
- She's my daughter.
- Yes.

608
00:43:56,800 --> 00:44:00,700
This is a second-degree burn.
I'll take her to Cedars.

609
00:44:00,900 --> 00:44:03,500
- Ow!
- It'll be fine, but it could get infected.

610
00:44:03,600 --> 00:44:07,300
Here's my name and my pager number.

611
00:44:07,600 --> 00:44:09,600
This is no place for her, you know it.

612
00:44:09,700 --> 00:44:13,200
- Dad, we're going home, right?
- This is not a safe place for you to be.

613
00:44:13,500 --> 00:44:16,100
- You need that leg taken care of.
- I wanna stay with you.

614
00:44:16,300 --> 00:44:17,500
She got any allergies?

615
00:44:17,600 --> 00:44:22,300
No. This lady's name is Dr Jaye Calder,
honey. She's a doctor. She's gonna help you.

616
00:44:22,600 --> 00:44:24,600
Watch your feet there.

617
00:44:25,500 --> 00:44:29,800
I want you to go with her. I'll talk to you
by phone as soon as you get to the hospital.

618
00:44:30,100 --> 00:44:32,600
- There's my card.
- Please, you can't leave me.

619
00:44:32,900 --> 00:44:35,100
Honey, you cannot be here and I have to stay.

620
00:44:35,400 --> 00:44:37,300
- Why?
- Because it's my responsibility.

621
00:44:37,300 --> 00:44:38,100
So am l.

622
00:44:39,800 --> 00:44:41,900
Please, I promise I won't get in the way.

623
00:44:43,600 --> 00:44:44,600
Just go.

624
00:44:44,700 --> 00:44:45,500
Go!

625
00:44:45,700 --> 00:44:47,100
- Go!
- Dad!

626
00:44:52,900 --> 00:44:54,700
Dad!

627
00:45:05,200 --> 00:45:07,600
- Hand me the radio. I really need it!
- No!

628
00:45:09,500 --> 00:45:11,200
You guys got any radios?

629
00:45:11,200 --> 00:45:15,600
We've gota lot ofconfusedpeople below us
running round terrified.

630
00:45:15,900 --> 00:45:19,200
This man,...
well, I can't even guess where he's running.

631
00:45:19,400 --> 00:45:22,600
I don't think so, Chief.
Why would Mike be running around?

632
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:25,100
- That's Mike Roark.
- Shut up! What?

633
00:45:25,200 --> 00:45:31,100
No. I just talked to Michael. He was in the car.
And, besides, this guy's a lot... taller.

634
00:45:31,500 --> 00:45:34,600
Look, Chief, I'm swamped right now.
I'll call you back.

635
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:37,600
- What the hell is that?
- Yes. All right, Reese out.

636
00:45:39,700 --> 00:45:41,400
You guys seeing this shit?

637
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,900
What can only be described as lava

638
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:48,800
is now snaking its way
down Stanley Avenue,just off Wilshire.

639
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:57,800
This is StanleyAvenue,just offWilshire. The
house behindmejust explodedinto flames

640
00:45:58,100 --> 00:46:00,700
and, to put it bluntly,
all hell is breaking loose.

641
00:46:00,900 --> 00:46:04,400
You can see the panic in residents' faces.
The fear and distress...

642
00:46:04,600 --> 00:46:08,200
God knows what it is,
but something fiery is raining down.

643
00:46:08,500 --> 00:46:10,000
It's a warzone here!

644
00:46:10,200 --> 00:46:12,900
- My dog is in there.
- You can't go in.

645
00:46:13,100 --> 00:46:16,500
But my dog is in there. Phil, come here, boy!

646
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:23,700
- My dog is in there!
- You just gotta hang on in. He'll be OK.

647
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:25,700
Phil! Come here, boy.

648
00:46:44,700 --> 00:46:46,000
Come here, Phil.

649
00:46:47,300 --> 00:46:52,200
Oh, Phil! Oh, you good dog.
You got it. You got it, boy.

650
00:46:52,400 --> 00:46:55,600
It's my house, man. I was born in that house.

651
00:46:55,700 --> 00:46:56,600
I know, I know.

652
00:46:56,800 --> 00:46:59,100
Fire trucks! How come I see no fire trucks?

653
00:46:59,300 --> 00:47:02,000
- They're up on Wilshire.
- I'm gonna get some help.

654
00:47:08,500 --> 00:47:11,500
- Um, I think you should pull over.
- Why?

655
00:47:11,700 --> 00:47:14,100
Because this guy's leg, it's like gushing.

656
00:47:14,300 --> 00:47:18,300
There's a blanket underneath him.
Get it and press it down over the wound hard.

657
00:47:18,600 --> 00:47:19,900
I think you should just...

658
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:23,900
If I don't get to the hospital, I'll lose
both these guys. Now, do what I tell you

659
00:47:24,200 --> 00:47:26,200
and help me out here.

660
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:31,000
Look, Kelly, I know you're scared.
I'm scared, too.

661
00:47:31,300 --> 00:47:33,300
So I'm gonna need your help.

662
00:47:34,500 --> 00:47:35,900
Help me, OK?

663
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:47,600
No-one has any idea
what to put in the way of this lava.

664
00:47:47,900 --> 00:47:51,700
Declaration of emergency,
assistance from county, state and federal.

665
00:47:51,900 --> 00:47:57,300
All available National Guard units
and air tankers. We need water dropped.

666
00:47:57,500 --> 00:48:02,000
OK, listen, Mike. I've got a bunch of meds
coming in. I'll ride 'em over to Midway, OK?

667
00:48:02,300 --> 00:48:06,000
No, send 'em to Cedars. That's where
we're sending patients. Safest place.

668
00:48:06,200 --> 00:48:07,700
All right, Cedars. Good.

669
00:48:07,900 --> 00:48:12,900
I got a message from Sindelar. He's stuck
on "the damn freeway." Wants me to tell you..

670
00:48:13,200 --> 00:48:16,800
- I've got a desk. That's where I work.
- ..yadda yadda yadda.

671
00:48:17,100 --> 00:48:19,400
- Tell him not to expect me. Out.
- No problem.

672
00:48:19,600 --> 00:48:21,400
Mitch, it's a chaotic scene,

673
00:48:21,600 --> 00:48:24,700
with emergency personnel
desperate to stop this thing.

674
00:48:24,900 --> 00:48:27,600
Officer,
do you know where the driver of that bus is?

675
00:48:27,800 --> 00:48:30,500
- What are you talking about?
- Come with me. Come on.

676
00:48:30,800 --> 00:48:33,800
..rolling past
the foot of County Art Museum,...

677
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:36,600
We now have a name for this crisis.

678
00:48:36,800 --> 00:48:40,200
It is, according to the US Geological Survey,
a volcano.

679
00:48:40,500 --> 00:48:45,300
Yes, you heard that correctly.
As remarkable as itsounds, a volcano here

680
00:48:45,500 --> 00:48:49,500
- Excuse me!
- is wreaking havoc throughout the city...

681
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:54,400
Oh, my God.

682
00:49:01,200 --> 00:49:03,300
You would have loved this, Rachel.

683
00:49:06,100 --> 00:49:08,900
- Cover! Cover!
- Hey.

684
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:12,600
Hey, no. Look at it. Keep watching it.

685
00:49:13,900 --> 00:49:16,000
Now! Move, you guys!

686
00:49:21,400 --> 00:49:23,600
It's a lava bomb.

687
00:49:23,800 --> 00:49:27,000
You don't do anything un...

688
00:49:28,900 --> 00:49:31,300
until you know where it's gonna land.

689
00:49:31,500 --> 00:49:34,500
I need 20 strong men standing right here.

690
00:49:34,700 --> 00:49:38,200
Go get those firemen right now,
and those officers right there.

691
00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:41,600
Get over here, guys. Over by this bus.

692
00:49:41,900 --> 00:49:45,500
- Right now. Let's go, hurry up.
- God, this Hieronymus Bosch is heavy.

693
00:49:45,800 --> 00:49:51,200
That's cos he deals with man's inclination
to a thing, in defiance of God's will.

694
00:49:51,500 --> 00:49:53,500
I didn't mean it like that.

695
00:49:53,700 --> 00:49:54,900
Oh.

696
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:56,300
Fellas, come over here.

697
00:49:56,500 --> 00:49:58,700
- Right over here. You were right.
- Hardly.

698
00:49:58,900 --> 00:50:02,300
Gentlemen, I want to move the bus
up against the museum like so.

699
00:50:02,500 --> 00:50:03,300
Like so!?

700
00:50:03,500 --> 00:50:06,900
Yes, like so. Then I wanna
shoot out the tyres on the other side.

701
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:10,800
I cannot turn it over
unless the tyres on one side are flat, all right?

702
00:50:13,300 --> 00:50:16,600
What we wanna do is build a corridor
to keep whatever this is...

703
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:17,800
It's lava.

704
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:21,200
All right, it's lava.
Get round to the front, fellas. Hurry up.

705
00:50:21,400 --> 00:50:23,100
Get around the front of the bus.

706
00:50:23,300 --> 00:50:27,500
All right, on the count ofthree, fellas.
One,... two

707
00:50:27,800 --> 00:50:28,600
three.

708
00:50:41,400 --> 00:50:45,300
Come on. Police officers on the other side,
shoot out those tyres.

709
00:50:45,600 --> 00:50:47,400
The rest of you guys, along this bus.

710
00:50:47,600 --> 00:50:48,900
Come here.

711
00:50:49,100 --> 00:50:51,000
All right, on the countdown, aim low.

712
00:50:51,100 --> 00:50:53,400
Three, two, one, fire.

713
00:50:58,400 --> 00:51:01,800
All right, we know that stuff is lava.
What do I do next?

714
00:51:02,100 --> 00:51:06,000
You have to evacuate the West Side. This'll
burn through the city till it hits the ocean.

715
00:51:06,300 --> 00:51:10,100
- It has a million people.
- There'll be a million dead or homeless.

716
00:51:10,300 --> 00:51:14,700
This is going to destroy
everything it touches.

717
00:51:20,100 --> 00:51:22,600
- He's still breathing. Can you grab this arm?
- Yeah.

718
00:51:22,700 --> 00:51:24,200
Grab him right there.

719
00:51:26,100 --> 00:51:27,400
Let's go, let's go!

720
00:51:27,500 --> 00:51:28,700
Let's get this guy out.

721
00:51:28,900 --> 00:51:32,200
Are you realising what we're dealing with?
This is a volcano.

722
00:51:32,400 --> 00:51:35,800
- All we can do is get out of its way.
- Run for the hills and hide?

723
00:51:36,100 --> 00:51:37,500
- Right.
- I can't do that.

724
00:51:37,700 --> 00:51:38,600
Look out!

725
00:51:38,700 --> 00:51:39,500
Look out!

726
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:53,100
Stay with this guy. Stay with him.

727
00:51:53,300 --> 00:51:55,200
Hey, get that ladder over here now!

728
00:51:58,300 --> 00:51:59,300
Bring it down!

729
00:51:59,500 --> 00:52:02,300
- What're you gonna do?
- Get us outta here if I can.

730
00:52:02,500 --> 00:52:05,600
Hey, watch out for those flames!

731
00:52:05,700 --> 00:52:09,700
Get that ladder out of the fire!
The hose is gonna burn!

732
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:13,600
- Clear!
- Ah!

733
00:52:13,900 --> 00:52:16,300
- Outta here. Move!
- We're not gonna do this.

734
00:52:16,400 --> 00:52:18,500
Pull him out!

735
00:52:18,700 --> 00:52:20,200
- Move!
- Oh, my God.

736
00:52:23,100 --> 00:52:24,600
- Oh, God. Oh, God.
- Hang on.

737
00:52:24,700 --> 00:52:27,900
- Push him in!
- I can't. The ladder's bust. Too much weight.

738
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:31,100
- I'm gonna have to swing 'em over.
- Move it!

739
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:36,400
- Couldn't he swing us the other way?
- I'll ask him when we get down.

740
00:52:36,800 --> 00:52:40,400
The hose is burning! The hose is on fire!

741
00:52:40,600 --> 00:52:42,600
- Argh!
- Shit!

742
00:52:42,700 --> 00:52:44,800
- Hold on!
- I'm holding on!

743
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:47,400
Faster. Move it. They're cookin' up there!

744
00:52:47,600 --> 00:52:50,100
My feet are burning! My feet are burning!

745
00:52:50,400 --> 00:52:53,400
Keep the guy still!
The ladder's gonna give!

746
00:52:53,600 --> 00:52:56,800
- My foot!
- Keep it still!

747
00:52:56,900 --> 00:53:00,700
- The ladder's going. We're losing it.
- Keep still! You're moving us!

748
00:53:02,100 --> 00:53:03,500
- Move it.
- Hang on!

749
00:53:03,700 --> 00:53:05,500
Stop kicking! Argh!

750
00:53:09,200 --> 00:53:11,000
Oh!

751
00:53:11,200 --> 00:53:12,600
Oh, my God!

752
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:18,900
This guy needs oxygen!
Get him over to Cedars right away.

753
00:53:19,100 --> 00:53:19,900
You all right?

754
00:53:21,700 --> 00:53:23,900
Oh... I'm sorry. Sorry.

755
00:53:24,100 --> 00:53:27,000
- Are you all right!?
- Yeah, I've never been better.

756
00:53:27,200 --> 00:53:29,200
So, what do we do now? Come on.

757
00:54:00,800 --> 00:54:02,600
That lava is coming from a vent.

758
00:54:02,600 --> 00:54:06,800
Bad news is there could be other vents,
bigger ones, maybe ten times as big,

759
00:54:06,900 --> 00:54:10,000
which means we may not have seen
the main eruption yet.

760
00:54:10,300 --> 00:54:13,400
- You think that's gonna happen?
- I need specifics, a phone.

761
00:54:13,600 --> 00:54:15,600
- Your phone! Give me that.
- Hey! I need that back.

762
00:54:15,800 --> 00:54:19,700
- I'm on the air. I need that back.
- Stay where you are. Stay where you are!

763
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:23,200
- Hey, lava's moving round the bus!
- Give me that phone.

764
00:54:23,400 --> 00:54:26,400
- Hey, that's property of KNX.
- Not any more, pal.

765
00:54:27,600 --> 00:54:31,100
All right, Emmit,
get me 200 K-rails to build a corridor.

766
00:54:31,300 --> 00:54:34,100
- What are K-rails?
- They're concrete freeway dividers.

767
00:54:34,300 --> 00:54:36,000
You planning on channelling this?

768
00:54:36,200 --> 00:54:38,300
- I'm on the telephone, all right.
- Sorry.

769
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:41,300
Mike, I'll call Public Works.
They could have some.

770
00:54:41,500 --> 00:54:44,300
- Roark?
- Yeah, and any private contractor we have...

771
00:54:44,600 --> 00:54:45,200
Roark!

772
00:54:51,100 --> 00:54:52,200
Hell!

773
00:54:53,200 --> 00:54:57,200
And call Gator. Cedars is gonna be swamped.
I want him over there.

774
00:54:57,500 --> 00:54:59,100
You don't want him with you?

775
00:54:59,300 --> 00:55:01,500
No, Kelly is on her way to Cedars now.

776
00:55:01,700 --> 00:55:02,900
She got burnt, Emmit.

777
00:55:04,400 --> 00:55:05,400
Shit.

778
00:55:05,500 --> 00:55:08,400
She'll have a suite
by the time the sun comes up, all right?

779
00:55:08,700 --> 00:55:09,900
All right. Out. What?

780
00:55:09,900 --> 00:55:12,500
The bus is just deflecting this, OK?

781
00:55:12,600 --> 00:55:17,800
It is coming back around. It's got in the store.
We are dealing with determined stuff here.

782
00:55:18,200 --> 00:55:21,200
All right,
we'll build berms until the K-rails get here.

783
00:55:21,400 --> 00:55:24,600
- With what?
- We'll dig up the streets, we'll improvise.

784
00:55:29,600 --> 00:55:35,400
Literally hundreds of firemen,
police, city workers have grabbed pickaxes

785
00:55:35,800 --> 00:55:39,200
to try to channel this down...

786
00:55:39,400 --> 00:55:43,400
..the ash and the smoke in the air right now.

787
00:55:43,700 --> 00:55:46,400
..to make a dentin this latest attack on LA.

788
00:55:46,600 --> 00:55:49,600
That wall has to be five or six metres tall.
Stay with it.

789
00:55:49,900 --> 00:55:54,200
It's hitting every street. We've got
structural fires and inhalation cases.

790
00:55:54,500 --> 00:55:56,400
- I can't keep it out without help.
- I'm working on it.

791
00:55:56,500 --> 00:56:01,700
Meantime, do all you can to keep it
on Wilshire. Use fire trucks, if you have to.

792
00:56:02,100 --> 00:56:06,000
My street's on fire.
You gotta get some trucks down there.

793
00:56:06,200 --> 00:56:09,600
- What street?
- The one with smoke coming out. Stanley.

794
00:56:09,900 --> 00:56:13,000
- Once this is under control.
- There won't be houses left by then!

795
00:56:13,100 --> 00:56:15,500
Look, I'm sorry. We'll get to 'em when we can.

796
00:56:15,800 --> 00:56:19,300
Yo, I'm talking about people's houses.
You're up here saving museums.

797
00:56:19,600 --> 00:56:21,200
D'you wanna get this guy off me?

798
00:56:21,400 --> 00:56:24,400
- Oh, great. Mark Fuhrman.
- Let me see your hands.

799
00:56:24,600 --> 00:56:26,400
- You gotta be joking.
- Give me your hands!

800
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:29,600
Get your goddamn hands off me!

801
00:56:29,800 --> 00:56:31,100
Hey, what's going on?

802
00:56:31,300 --> 00:56:34,800
- He was harassing a firefighter.
- Bullshit. I was asking for help.

803
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:37,300
- This is stupid. Let him go.
- I'm taking him in.

804
00:56:37,500 --> 00:56:38,900
Aw, he's all yours.

805
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:41,900
- Shouldn't you be saving lives?
- Don't move!

806
00:56:42,100 --> 00:56:46,400
Watch that third rail.
I don't want anybody hitting that.

807
00:56:46,700 --> 00:56:49,700
Hey, watch for the rubble right there!
Watch for the rubble.

808
00:56:51,900 --> 00:56:53,800
Oh, Jesus.

809
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:57,000
- There she is.
- Looks like we got a hell of a fire, Stan.

810
00:56:57,100 --> 00:56:58,000
Yeah, we sure do.

811
00:56:58,200 --> 00:57:00,400
Right, let's go, let's go, double time!

812
00:57:00,500 --> 00:57:04,500
It can't be gas, they turned off
the whole quadrant. Gotta be electrical.

813
00:57:04,700 --> 00:57:09,100
Call LAFD! Tell them there's a fire
500 yards from MacArthur Park station!

814
00:57:09,400 --> 00:57:13,700
Get those first-aid kits
and those oxygen masks down here now!

815
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:16,000
Here, give me that.

816
00:57:16,500 --> 00:57:18,600
Come on. Hit it.

817
00:57:20,300 --> 00:57:22,500
Come on, hit it!

818
00:57:26,400 --> 00:57:28,400
Oh, my God.

819
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:33,600
Give me a push.

820
00:57:33,700 --> 00:57:38,300
- Let's check these people out in here.
- Check 'em out.

821
00:57:38,600 --> 00:57:40,400
I got a pulse! Get the other one.

822
00:57:40,500 --> 00:57:43,700
How many we got?
Give me a count here! Give me a count!

823
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:45,300
Some oxygen up here.

824
00:57:47,700 --> 00:57:49,200
Stan.

825
00:57:49,400 --> 00:57:51,100
Just a second. Just a second.

826
00:57:51,200 --> 00:57:52,000
Stan!

827
00:57:52,200 --> 00:57:55,400
Let's get everybody out on the station floor.

828
00:57:55,500 --> 00:57:57,500
What you got, Pete?

829
00:57:59,300 --> 00:58:01,000
What the hell is that?

830
00:58:08,300 --> 00:58:09,500
Get off the train...

831
00:58:09,600 --> 00:58:11,300
Get off the train! Get off the train!

832
00:58:11,500 --> 00:58:15,200
Every one of these bodies off the train now!
Fireman's carry, go, go!

833
00:58:15,400 --> 00:58:18,400
- We can't get 'em all.
- Anybody see the driver?

834
00:58:19,400 --> 00:58:20,500
Give me your gloves.

835
00:58:20,700 --> 00:58:23,200
- What're you doing?
- I gotta find the driver.

836
00:58:23,400 --> 00:58:28,000
Every one of these people off the train now.
Come on, move it! Move it! Go! Go!

837
00:58:29,800 --> 00:58:31,300
Stan, get back here!

838
00:58:34,100 --> 00:58:39,200
We are in the parking lot at Cedars Sinai
and this is an incredible scene.

839
00:58:39,600 --> 00:58:42,200
These people are staying in the parking lot

840
00:58:42,300 --> 00:58:46,000
because the emergencyroom
is filled to capacity.

841
00:58:46,100 --> 00:58:49,100
The injuredjustkeep coming here
one afteranother.

842
00:58:49,500 --> 00:58:55,800
This, to me, seems more like a MASH unit
than a majormetropolitan hospital...

843
00:58:56,100 --> 00:58:57,900
Yeah?

844
00:58:58,100 --> 00:59:00,100
- Gator, you got my girl?
- Right here.

845
00:59:00,300 --> 00:59:03,600
- Doc says she's gonna be fine.
- Nearly done.

846
00:59:03,900 --> 00:59:06,300
All right, let me talk to her.

847
00:59:12,100 --> 00:59:15,900
Man's got a direct line to the governor,
but he's calling you.

848
00:59:16,200 --> 00:59:20,800
- I'm fine, Daddy. Honestly,... I'm OK.
- This is gonna sting.

849
00:59:21,100 --> 00:59:22,500
OK?

850
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:26,700
- I love you, baby.
- Then stop sending us bodies.

851
00:59:26,900 --> 00:59:30,100
- We have gota full house overhere.
- I don't have any choice.

852
00:59:30,400 --> 00:59:35,500
Cedars Sinai is the only emergency room
that's still safe and north of the flow.

853
00:59:35,800 --> 00:59:39,200
We got earthquake victims,
burns, smoke inhalations.

854
00:59:39,400 --> 00:59:41,800
They're doing triage on the sidewalk.

855
00:59:41,900 --> 00:59:46,100
Put the post-ops in the mall.
Beverly Center's gotta have its own power.

856
00:59:46,400 --> 00:59:47,900
- The mall, huh?
- Yeah.

857
00:59:48,100 --> 00:59:49,400
Anything good at the cineplex?

858
00:59:51,100 --> 00:59:53,100
Have the cops close the streets for you.

859
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:00,000
Oh, goddammit.

860
01:00:01,600 --> 01:00:03,100
Jesus H Christ.

861
01:00:04,700 --> 01:00:07,400
- See that? The flow's gonna turn.
- Yeah, I saw it.

862
01:00:07,500 --> 01:00:11,200
- What's south of here, Lieutenant?
- Convalescent homes, hospitals.

863
01:00:11,300 --> 01:00:15,500
I'll tell you. A big gas station,
a million houses and everyone I know.

864
01:00:15,700 --> 01:00:18,200
Get back in there.
We need everybody we can get.

865
01:00:18,400 --> 01:00:19,200
Shit!

866
01:00:19,400 --> 01:00:22,500
Emmit, where are those K-rails?
I need 'em right now.

867
01:00:22,700 --> 01:00:26,700
Hey, what were you trying to do?
Take that guy downtown?

868
01:00:27,100 --> 01:00:30,500
- Better take the freeway. Wilshire looks bad.
- Hey, enough!

869
01:00:30,500 --> 01:00:32,800
Let's get these people on the cart.

870
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:36,000
Come on, Stan. Come on, Stan.
Where the hell are you?

871
01:01:12,900 --> 01:01:16,000
Holy Mary, mother of God, pray for us sinners
now and at the hour of our death.

872
01:01:16,200 --> 01:01:18,700
Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with thee.

873
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:25,100
Holy Mary, mother of God, pray for us sinners
now and at the hour of our death.

874
01:01:25,400 --> 01:01:29,000
Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with thee.
Blessed art thou amongst women,

875
01:01:29,300 --> 01:01:33,000
and blessed is the fruit of thy womb.
Holy Mary, mother of God...

876
01:01:33,100 --> 01:01:36,700
- Get on the walkie...
- Hey, it's Stan!

877
01:01:40,800 --> 01:01:43,700
Jump, Stan! Come on, Stan! Go!

878
01:01:44,900 --> 01:01:46,700
Stan, get outta there!

879
01:01:46,900 --> 01:01:48,200
Jump!

880
01:01:48,300 --> 01:01:52,600
- Get outta here!
- No, Stan! You can't save him!

881
01:01:52,900 --> 01:01:54,300
Come on, jump!

882
01:01:57,100 --> 01:01:59,900
- Come on!
- Come on! Save yourself!

883
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:03,400
No!

884
01:02:10,600 --> 01:02:12,200
Aaahhhhhhh!

885
01:02:14,800 --> 01:02:17,800
Aaahhh!

886
01:02:18,100 --> 01:02:18,900
Ah!

887
01:02:28,200 --> 01:02:31,600
- Emmit, FAA want an update.
- Where are we with the airports?

888
01:02:31,800 --> 01:02:35,100
No more outgoing.
Incoming is being re-routed to Ontario.

889
01:02:35,300 --> 01:02:37,100
No, no, no, no. Marty, no.

890
01:02:37,300 --> 01:02:42,200
Look at the screen. That cloud is blowing due
east. We gotta send everything to San Diego.

891
01:02:42,400 --> 01:02:47,800
Emmit, they got two gas lines burning on
Fairfax. They can't get any hydrant pressure.

892
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:49,600
- Swimming pools.
- What about them?

893
01:02:49,800 --> 01:02:53,800
Pump out all the swimming pools.
That's all the water we need.

894
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:58,000
Emmit, just got a call from La Brea.
Total gridlock from Pico to Sunset.

895
01:02:58,200 --> 01:03:01,700
- Didn't we send over those traffic cops?
- That's who's calling.

896
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:04,200
Cars keep stalling out because of the ash.

897
01:03:04,300 --> 01:03:07,100
- It's clogging up the air filters.
- Chevettes, right?

898
01:03:09,700 --> 01:03:13,000
OK, nowyou can see it coming rightat us.

899
01:03:13,200 --> 01:03:19,400
Just a relentless tide oflava melting the street
itself. Itincinerates everything it touches.

900
01:03:19,700 --> 01:03:23,600
They're using concrete, they're using cars,...

901
01:03:23,900 --> 01:03:28,200
- You gotta get me some water pressure!
- I can't. The city's out.

902
01:03:28,500 --> 01:03:30,700
- Hydrants are dry!
- Lights are out in San Francisco.

903
01:03:30,900 --> 01:03:33,900
- We gotta get these guys some help.
- Yeah, I can see that.

904
01:03:35,400 --> 01:03:39,400
Don't you hear me?
I said the lights are out in San Francisco.

905
01:03:39,600 --> 01:03:43,500
But this street's on fire.
Nobody gives a shit about San Francisco!

906
01:04:05,600 --> 01:04:08,100
All right, good to see you.

907
01:04:08,300 --> 01:04:13,300
We want a corridor outta these K-rails. Keep it
flowing down Wilshire and headed west, OK?

908
01:04:13,600 --> 01:04:15,800
- Where are the rest of them?
- This is it.

909
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:20,000
- There's only about 80 here.
- 82. Everything else is stuck on the 5 or 10.

910
01:04:20,300 --> 01:04:23,700
We're trying to keep the city in one piece.
80 rails won't do it!

911
01:04:23,700 --> 01:04:25,800
- What you blaming me for?
- Convenience!

912
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:29,200
- Maybe we can chopper more in?
- One at at time, forget it!

913
01:04:29,500 --> 01:04:33,600
Why not knock down a couple of buildings
and block this son of a bitch?

914
01:04:33,900 --> 01:04:35,800
All right, come with me.

915
01:04:35,800 --> 01:04:37,600
You guys, come with me.

916
01:04:39,200 --> 01:04:41,600
- Open a reservoir!
- And the city drinks what?!

917
01:04:41,800 --> 01:04:44,300
- There won't be a city, ifyou don't move.
- I'm doing my best!

918
01:04:44,400 --> 01:04:47,100
Knock this shit off! What is with you people?

919
01:04:47,300 --> 01:04:50,000
Chief, how long will it take this stuff
to get to Fairfax?

920
01:04:50,200 --> 01:04:54,900
- About ten minutes, give or take.
- Enough time to build a barricade?

921
01:04:58,100 --> 01:05:03,000
All right, look.
Wilshire Boulevard, Fairfax.

922
01:05:03,300 --> 01:05:05,600
80 K-rails, double stacked in a horseshoe.

923
01:05:05,700 --> 01:05:06,600
OK?

924
01:05:07,900 --> 01:05:09,000
A cul-de-sac.

925
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:12,500
That's gotta be a wall at least 6ft high.

926
01:05:12,700 --> 01:05:16,600
- D'you have any helicopters, water tankers?
- Not yet, but they're on the way.

927
01:05:16,700 --> 01:05:22,100
Once you get this lava to pool, dump
everything on it, all at once, to form a crust.

928
01:05:22,500 --> 01:05:24,600
Maybe it'll dam itself like one did in lceland.

929
01:05:25,700 --> 01:05:27,900
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

930
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:30,200
This is putting a Band-Aid on a broken leg.

931
01:05:30,300 --> 01:05:33,400
I don't know how many men
to keep putting in front of this thing.

932
01:05:33,600 --> 01:05:35,100
As many people as it takes.

933
01:05:35,300 --> 01:05:37,800
Listen up, let me tell you what's south of us.

934
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:42,500
No more museums or department stores,
just homes, people.

935
01:05:42,800 --> 01:05:44,800
If we run now, they're defenceless.

936
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:48,700
You don't like my plan, give me another one,
but don't say we're backing out.

937
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:51,600
- Is everybody clear on that?
- Yeah!

938
01:05:51,800 --> 01:05:53,900
All right, let's go. Build a wall.

939
01:06:05,900 --> 01:06:07,400
Come on, push him over.

940
01:06:07,400 --> 01:06:09,000
Push him over.

941
01:06:12,800 --> 01:06:15,000
All right, come on. Push 'em on in.

942
01:06:17,600 --> 01:06:20,000
Give me 14 or 15 guys
on each of these things.

943
01:06:20,300 --> 01:06:22,200
Right over here on this K-rail.

944
01:06:22,200 --> 01:06:25,900
Right in here. Hold it.
On the other side. Watch your leg!

945
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:31,500
Right over here, fellas.
There's room by there. Pick 'em up.

946
01:06:35,100 --> 01:06:37,000
Let's go. Lift!

947
01:06:41,700 --> 01:06:44,400
- Come on.
- We need more guys on this one.

948
01:06:46,300 --> 01:06:47,500
Shit, it's too heavy.

949
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:54,000
Hey, man, you know what they say.
No pain, no gain.

950
01:06:54,100 --> 01:06:55,300
All right, that's it!

951
01:06:55,400 --> 01:06:58,900
I knew it, I'm about to be
the volcano version of Rodney King.

952
01:06:59,200 --> 01:07:00,700
Give me your hand.

953
01:07:00,800 --> 01:07:03,600
- Roll the tape. Y'all got this?
- Give me your hands.

954
01:07:05,800 --> 01:07:07,000
Go home.

955
01:07:07,200 --> 01:07:09,400
- I'm supposed to say thanks?
- No.

956
01:07:09,600 --> 01:07:12,200
- What did you do that for?
- Let's go.

957
01:07:12,300 --> 01:07:16,700
Still don't have enough guys over here!
Give us a hand.

958
01:07:16,900 --> 01:07:20,300
Come on.

959
01:07:24,500 --> 01:07:25,500
Come on!

960
01:07:25,600 --> 01:07:28,000
You block this,
it stays out the neighbourhood?

961
01:07:28,300 --> 01:07:29,600
Yeah, that's the idea.

962
01:07:33,200 --> 01:07:35,300
Come on. Let's go. Come on, move! Move!

963
01:07:36,400 --> 01:07:38,100
Come on! What you waiting for?

964
01:07:38,300 --> 01:07:42,200
- Come on.
- All right! Let's move this thing!

965
01:07:42,300 --> 01:07:45,500
1,... 2,... 3!

966
01:07:45,900 --> 01:07:46,900
Aagh!

967
01:07:56,500 --> 01:07:57,700
OK, keep moving.

968
01:07:57,800 --> 01:08:00,300
Put it over there!

969
01:08:00,400 --> 01:08:03,300
With so manypeople injured,

970
01:08:03,600 --> 01:08:08,100
it is so easy to forget the victims
who can't tell you where ithurts.

971
01:08:08,400 --> 01:08:13,000
And, fortunately, these wonderful
veterinarians have put their lives on hold

972
01:08:13,300 --> 01:08:14,600
to help these animals.

973
01:08:14,700 --> 01:08:19,800
This is a greatstory. This pot-belliedpig
was trying to findhis owner...

974
01:08:20,100 --> 01:08:24,000
OK, just one more stitch.
You're really brave, you know that?

975
01:08:24,300 --> 01:08:25,500
We got internal bleeding here.

976
01:08:26,900 --> 01:08:28,400
Can you watch her?

977
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:34,100
Are you OK?

978
01:08:35,300 --> 01:08:36,800
Yeah.

979
01:08:37,900 --> 01:08:39,400
- Is the boy hers?
- Yes.

980
01:08:39,700 --> 01:08:43,200
- We're putting kids in the mall. Prep her.
- Mommy.

981
01:08:43,500 --> 01:08:44,500
Mommy...

982
01:08:44,500 --> 01:08:46,500
How are you at baby-sitting?

983
01:08:50,400 --> 01:08:51,800
- Hi.
- Hi.

984
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:53,600
You OK?

985
01:08:55,600 --> 01:08:57,400
- Step up, we don't have a lotta time!
- Roark!

986
01:08:57,500 --> 01:09:00,200
- Yeah?
- There is lava in the Red Line.

987
01:09:00,500 --> 01:09:05,300
Just came through on the emergency band.
It destroyed a train near MacArthur Park.

988
01:09:05,600 --> 01:09:08,600
- Is it still flowing?
- It's stopped, but I think there's more.

989
01:09:08,800 --> 01:09:13,000
There's got to be something
feeding this from below. A source.

990
01:09:13,200 --> 01:09:16,100
It broke through here, at the Tar Pits,
created this vent.

991
01:09:16,400 --> 01:09:21,300
We now know it broke through at MacArthur
Park, so it's travelling laterally underground

992
01:09:21,600 --> 01:09:24,000
over the course of at least eight miles.

993
01:09:24,100 --> 01:09:27,600
- You said it blows up.
- I've never tracked lava under a city before.

994
01:09:27,900 --> 01:09:30,900
I don't know what it'll do
with man-made tunnels to travel through.

995
01:09:31,100 --> 01:09:36,600
I need everything to deal with what's
in front of me. I don't have time for a theory.

996
01:09:36,900 --> 01:09:40,500
- All right, but somebody's got to.
- I can only fight what I can see.

997
01:09:40,600 --> 01:09:41,600
I know.

998
01:09:41,800 --> 01:09:43,800
Good luck. I'm gonna check it out.

999
01:09:43,900 --> 01:09:44,900
All right.

1000
01:09:44,900 --> 01:09:47,300
Here's a recap of the crisis as itstands.

1001
01:09:47,600 --> 01:09:50,900
Throughout the city
shelters are being hastily erected

1002
01:09:51,100 --> 01:09:58,300
out of schools, churches and synagogues
in an attempt to house the shaken citizens.

1003
01:09:58,800 --> 01:10:01,800
OK, ready, you guys? OK, 1, 2, 3.

1004
01:10:02,700 --> 01:10:04,000
Shh.

1005
01:10:04,200 --> 01:10:06,800
Rock beats scissor and scissor beats paper.

1006
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:09,500
I'm not paper. I'm lava.

1007
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:12,700
What beats that?

1008
01:10:15,400 --> 01:10:16,800
My dad...

1009
01:10:17,300 --> 01:10:19,100
I hope.

1010
01:11:03,700 --> 01:11:08,000
Save your hoses, Chief.
I wanna let it pool up all the way to the top.

1011
01:11:08,300 --> 01:11:09,200
Save your hoses!

1012
01:11:11,900 --> 01:11:13,600
Not a drop until I give the word.

1013
01:11:19,900 --> 01:11:23,300
We'll just have to wait it out now.

1014
01:12:19,600 --> 01:12:21,500
This is the moment of truth.

1015
01:12:21,700 --> 01:12:26,100
- The entire streetis now engulfedin flames.
- The weight of this lava has to be intense.

1016
01:12:26,300 --> 01:12:30,900
- ..um das Lava zuruckdrangen.
- Will this plan work?

1017
01:12:42,500 --> 01:12:46,200
- Hubschrauber!
- All right, that's it, Chief. Open 'em up!

1018
01:12:46,500 --> 01:12:47,300
Open hoses.

1019
01:12:47,400 --> 01:12:49,500
Open hoses!

1020
01:13:43,200 --> 01:13:47,300
There must be thousands of gallons of water
being dropped over this entire area.

1021
01:13:47,500 --> 01:13:49,500
The entire area is drenched

1022
01:13:49,800 --> 01:13:52,500
and the steam coming off this thing
is unbelievable.

1023
01:14:00,700 --> 01:14:02,700
Oh, shit.

1024
01:14:28,700 --> 01:14:30,000
Oh, God.

1025
01:14:44,800 --> 01:14:50,500
I don't believe it. It looks possible
that this whole thing maybe nearing an end.

1026
01:14:50,800 --> 01:14:53,600
This incredible gamble
seems to be paying off.

1027
01:14:53,800 --> 01:14:56,900
- Did we just beat this bastard?
- It looks like it!

1028
01:14:57,100 --> 01:14:58,500
Flood control!

1029
01:14:58,600 --> 01:15:04,400
Ladies and gentlemen, it is a miracle.
And look at the faces of these people.

1030
01:15:04,800 --> 01:15:07,400
Look at these guys!
It looks like they've done it.

1031
01:15:07,600 --> 01:15:10,800
They have accomplished the impossible.

1032
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:17,400
They've beaten MotherNature and claimed
an extraordinary victory over the volcano.

1033
01:15:17,700 --> 01:15:22,000
One lastheroic stand
here on the corner ofFairfaxand Wilshire.

1034
01:15:22,300 --> 01:15:25,500
Hell of a party!
I probably should have brought a hat.

1035
01:15:31,500 --> 01:15:37,600
Chief, they need some help over on Stanley.
Structural fires, residential.

1036
01:15:37,900 --> 01:15:42,100
- Miller, get your engine over to Stanley.
- Yes, sir.

1037
01:15:44,300 --> 01:15:46,100
I guess that's my bus.

1038
01:15:46,300 --> 01:15:48,500
Hey, good luck.

1039
01:15:49,900 --> 01:15:51,400
You, too, man.

1040
01:15:57,300 --> 01:16:00,100
Show me what this baby can do.
You ready or what?

1041
01:16:09,900 --> 01:16:14,400
Yo, I always wanted to ride one of these
things, man. Stanley Ave, here we come!

1042
01:16:14,700 --> 01:16:16,700
Whoo!

1043
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:19,000
You're a good man, Jerry.

1044
01:16:24,600 --> 01:16:26,800
- All right, Roark.
- Thanks, fellas.

1045
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:29,700
Way to go, guys!

1046
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:31,300
Roark! Hey, way to go.

1047
01:16:31,300 --> 01:16:33,900
How fast can you get to
Wilshire and Western? We got a problem.

1048
01:16:34,100 --> 01:16:36,200
Not any more, we got it stopped.

1049
01:16:36,400 --> 01:16:38,700
Volume of ash is too hot to be out of danger.

1050
01:16:38,900 --> 01:16:40,200
How come it's stopped?

1051
01:16:40,300 --> 01:16:43,900
- Maybe it went some place else.
- How d'you know it didn'tjust stop?

1052
01:16:44,200 --> 01:16:48,400
I don't, but when Mount St Helen's blew
the force was 27,000 times greater

1053
01:16:48,700 --> 01:16:50,900
than that of the Hiroshima bomb.

1054
01:16:51,100 --> 01:16:53,600
You think that vent
released that much energy?

1055
01:16:53,800 --> 01:16:54,600
No.

1056
01:16:54,700 --> 01:16:57,500
Let's assume we haven'tseen
the realbulk of the magma yet.

1057
01:16:57,700 --> 01:16:59,100
Trust me, get down here.

1058
01:17:00,500 --> 01:17:01,400
Shit!

1059
01:17:05,200 --> 01:17:07,100
Hey, hey, that's my bike.

1060
01:17:08,500 --> 01:17:11,400
As crews battled the flow on Wilshire,

1061
01:17:11,600 --> 01:17:15,800
emergency rooms at Cedars Sinai
and Midwayhospitals have all reported

1062
01:17:16,100 --> 01:17:18,800
that their staffs andsupplies
are being overwhelmed...

1063
01:17:19,000 --> 01:17:19,600
Yes?

1064
01:17:19,700 --> 01:17:22,100
Jaye, I wantyou home with me
where it's safe.

1065
01:17:22,300 --> 01:17:23,800
Norman, can we talk later?

1066
01:17:24,100 --> 01:17:26,400
I don't like his breathing. Let's tube him.

1067
01:17:26,400 --> 01:17:29,600
Jaye, you've been there hours.
Let someone else take over!

1068
01:17:29,800 --> 01:17:32,700
God knows
what those "people" are coughing up on you.

1069
01:17:32,900 --> 01:17:34,000
Calder, we need help.

1070
01:17:34,100 --> 01:17:35,300
- I'm hanging up.
- Jaye!

1071
01:17:37,300 --> 01:17:37,900
Go!

1072
01:17:42,300 --> 01:17:46,700
- Right over the Red Line.
- That steam could come from anywhere.

1073
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:50,700
- Maybe the quake broke a water main.
- How'd it get heated?

1074
01:17:50,900 --> 01:17:53,300
- I don't know.
- Lower me down. I'm gonna find out.

1075
01:17:53,500 --> 01:17:55,100
- No.
- Why? Too dangerous?

1076
01:17:55,200 --> 01:17:56,800
- Yes.
- I thought it was a water main.

1077
01:17:57,000 --> 01:18:00,500
- All right. I'll go.
- How you gonna get up? I'm gonna lift you?

1078
01:18:00,600 --> 01:18:03,900
- I'm not letting you go.
- Then what are we gonna do?

1079
01:18:10,800 --> 01:18:15,200
Oh, God, this is so stupid.
This city's finally paying for its arrogance.

1080
01:18:15,500 --> 01:18:18,300
Which particular arrogance is that?

1081
01:18:18,600 --> 01:18:21,700
Building a subway
under land that's seismically active.

1082
01:18:21,800 --> 01:18:24,900
It was a foolish man
that builthis house upon the sand.

1083
01:18:26,600 --> 01:18:29,700
Matthew 7:26. A favourite among geologists.

1084
01:18:38,600 --> 01:18:41,900
All right, there's the tunnel.
I don't see anything.

1085
01:18:42,100 --> 01:18:43,900
Hm. What way are we facing?

1086
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:45,600
I don't know.

1087
01:18:49,100 --> 01:18:50,300
I can't see anything.

1088
01:19:01,400 --> 01:19:02,900
- Hey!
- Wha...

1089
01:19:04,200 --> 01:19:05,100
Oh!

1090
01:19:11,800 --> 01:19:13,300
Damn.

1091
01:19:20,400 --> 01:19:22,500
Ow! Damn!

1092
01:19:22,700 --> 01:19:24,000
Oh, God.

1093
01:19:25,900 --> 01:19:27,500
The tunnel's insulating it.

1094
01:19:27,600 --> 01:19:29,600
It's like a lava tube.

1095
01:19:29,800 --> 01:19:32,800
It's keeping it fluid,
which is why it's moving so fast.

1096
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:34,000
But moving where?

1097
01:19:34,200 --> 01:19:39,300
It's gonna go through the tunnels until it hits
a block. Once there, it'll punch through.

1098
01:19:39,600 --> 01:19:41,400
You mean erupt.

1099
01:19:42,200 --> 01:19:43,400
Yeah!

1100
01:19:44,900 --> 01:19:46,700
One, two,

1101
01:19:46,900 --> 01:19:48,200
three.

1102
01:19:51,200 --> 01:19:54,600
One, two, three.

1103
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:58,200
- How far between tunnel sections?
- How should I know?

1104
01:19:58,300 --> 01:19:59,900
- Guess!
- 10 or 12 feet.

1105
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:02,800
This is Roark.
I need to know where the Red Line stops.

1106
01:20:03,100 --> 01:20:05,700
We gotta figure out
how fast this shit is moving.

1107
01:20:05,800 --> 01:20:09,800
- You mean where the last station is?
- No, where did you stop the tunnel?

1108
01:20:10,800 --> 01:20:14,200
We stopped drilling
under the Beverly Center, La Cienega.

1109
01:20:14,400 --> 01:20:17,400
My God. That's where Cedars Sinai is.

1110
01:20:17,700 --> 01:20:20,300
That's where Kelly is.
How long before it hits La Cienega?

1111
01:20:22,500 --> 01:20:23,500
Hold on.

1112
01:20:23,600 --> 01:20:27,200
- How long before it hits La Cienega?!
- I don't know.

1113
01:20:27,500 --> 01:20:29,400
If a tunnel's caved in, it'll be slower.

1114
01:20:31,100 --> 01:20:33,400
God. 30 minutes, maybe less.

1115
01:20:33,600 --> 01:20:35,600
- That's not enough time!
- No kidding.

1116
01:20:35,800 --> 01:20:37,700
We gotta move those people.

1117
01:20:39,200 --> 01:20:43,200
No, no, that ain't a possibility, Mike.
We don't have any hands left.

1118
01:20:43,400 --> 01:20:48,500
We got secondary fires popping off all
over the city. They're looting in Beverly Hills.

1119
01:20:48,800 --> 01:20:52,800
Then we have to re-route it or block it
in some way. We got 2,000 people in the way.

1120
01:20:53,100 --> 01:20:57,200
Listen, Moses couldn't re-route this shit, OK?
It's everywhere.

1121
01:20:57,400 --> 01:20:59,300
We got a flow in a storm drain...

1122
01:20:59,500 --> 01:21:01,800
The Genesee transformer's out.
That means the West...

1123
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:05,500
- Where's that storm drain go?
- It dumps into Ballona Creek.

1124
01:21:05,700 --> 01:21:08,300
What did you just say?

1125
01:21:08,400 --> 01:21:09,600
Hold it!

1126
01:21:09,700 --> 01:21:11,100
It dumps into Ballona Creek.

1127
01:21:11,800 --> 01:21:15,300
- Ballona Creek runs into the ocean.
- We caught a break on that one.

1128
01:21:15,400 --> 01:21:18,300
Yeah. I would say! How close is it to Cedars?

1129
01:21:18,600 --> 01:21:22,600
It's close enough. All right, listen up, Emmit.
I need a demolitions team,

1130
01:21:23,000 --> 01:21:27,700
LAPD, National Guard, private contractor,
or all three at San Vicente

1131
01:21:27,800 --> 01:21:29,400
and 3rd right now!

1132
01:21:29,400 --> 01:21:31,300
We want 'em with all they've got.

1133
01:21:43,500 --> 01:21:44,800
Oh, shit.

1134
01:21:45,600 --> 01:21:47,300
Man, I wanna be like Mike.

1135
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:52,500
Right outside Cedars
we don'tknow what's going on rightnow.

1136
01:21:52,700 --> 01:21:57,100
Officials have toldpeople here
to evacuate immediately.

1137
01:21:57,400 --> 01:22:02,200
And realise, these are injuredpeople,
some severely, so something is going on.

1138
01:22:04,800 --> 01:22:07,000
All right, here's what the lava is doing.

1139
01:22:07,200 --> 01:22:11,400
It will flow down the Red Line subway tunnel
until it comes to a dead end: this intersection.

1140
01:22:11,700 --> 01:22:17,400
This is the Holly Hills storm drain extension.
It connects here to the Holly Hills trench.

1141
01:22:17,600 --> 01:22:21,800
Anything that flows into that trench will come
through the storm drain, on to the ocean.

1142
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:24,000
- We got 25 minutes...
- 20 minutes.

1143
01:22:24,100 --> 01:22:29,700
20 minutes to extend the San Vicente trench
200 yards up San Vicente Boulevard

1144
01:22:29,900 --> 01:22:31,300
to this place here.

1145
01:22:31,500 --> 01:22:33,300
- Extend it?
- Yes, extend it.

1146
01:22:33,500 --> 01:22:36,900
- Where are we at?
- Ground zero. Lava'll break through here.

1147
01:22:37,100 --> 01:22:38,400
- Right here?
- Yes.

1148
01:22:38,600 --> 01:22:41,700
I want you
to drill holes in San Vicente Boulevard,

1149
01:22:41,900 --> 01:22:46,500
Iower enough charges into it to blow up
a trench 200 yards long, as wide as the street

1150
01:22:46,900 --> 01:22:48,500
- and as deep as you can make.
- What!

1151
01:22:48,600 --> 01:22:52,000
- We're gonna take this thing to the ocean.
- Wait, this won't work.

1152
01:22:52,200 --> 01:22:55,800
The street slopes the other way.
Look at the contours.

1153
01:22:56,000 --> 01:23:00,600
It is not going to move into the trench. It will
go the opposite direction into the patients.

1154
01:23:00,900 --> 01:23:04,300
- Maybe some can be diverted...
- No! It won't. Would you trust me?

1155
01:23:04,600 --> 01:23:06,400
It is going to flow that way.

1156
01:23:06,500 --> 01:23:11,800
Now, everybody grab some stretchers.
Let's save as many lives as we possibly can.

1157
01:23:12,200 --> 01:23:16,200
That's 2,000 patients.
We can't possibly save everybody.

1158
01:23:16,400 --> 01:23:18,800
I know.
I sent them over there with my daughter.

1159
01:23:22,700 --> 01:23:24,700
I.. I...

1160
01:23:25,800 --> 01:23:27,800
I... I don't know...

1161
01:23:29,400 --> 01:23:31,400
I don't know what to do.

1162
01:23:44,600 --> 01:23:46,500
What about a dam?

1163
01:23:46,700 --> 01:23:50,300
Something we can drop in front
of the hospital and divert the flow this way?

1164
01:23:50,400 --> 01:23:54,000
- What?
- What she said, knocking a building down?

1165
01:23:54,200 --> 01:23:55,400
Are you serious?

1166
01:23:55,600 --> 01:23:59,700
Yes, I'm serious. It's gotta be 50,000 tons
of steel and concrete. Would that work?

1167
01:23:59,900 --> 01:24:03,200
- You are gonna knock a building down?
- Yes, I am. Would it work?

1168
01:24:03,500 --> 01:24:05,500
I think it might. I think it might.

1169
01:24:05,500 --> 01:24:07,400
You wanna bring it down against the mall?

1170
01:24:07,600 --> 01:24:08,300
Absolutely.

1171
01:24:08,400 --> 01:24:11,400
That's a precision drop.
That takes days to plan.

1172
01:24:13,300 --> 01:24:15,000
Set a speed record.

1173
01:24:15,200 --> 01:24:17,600
You wanna
knock down a building in 20 minutes?

1174
01:24:17,800 --> 01:24:18,200
19 now.

1175
01:24:18,400 --> 01:24:20,100
Split the squad, let's go.

1176
01:24:20,300 --> 01:24:22,000
What d'you want me to do?

1177
01:24:26,100 --> 01:24:27,400
Find my daughter,

1178
01:24:27,600 --> 01:24:29,200
please.

1179
01:24:29,200 --> 01:24:33,000
I left her with a Dr Jaye Calder.

1180
01:24:33,300 --> 01:24:36,300
I gave that woman my child,
she gave me this card. Find her.

1181
01:24:36,500 --> 01:24:39,700
OK. I'll find her, OK?

1182
01:24:39,900 --> 01:24:41,900
Trust me, I'll find her.

1183
01:24:46,600 --> 01:24:50,600
Sergeant, bring your men
and follow me right now!

1184
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:55,000
Come this way.
Put your first hole right there.

1185
01:24:58,000 --> 01:24:59,300
Food.

1186
01:24:59,500 --> 01:25:00,300
Where's Tommy?

1187
01:25:00,400 --> 01:25:04,300
He went through there.
Can I have those French fries?

1188
01:25:17,600 --> 01:25:22,700
Remain calm.
We are evacuating the triage unitnow.

1189
01:25:28,700 --> 01:25:31,600
- Excuse me, I'm looking for a little boy.
- Un momento.

1190
01:25:33,300 --> 01:25:35,700
Have you seen a little boy?
He has blond hair.

1191
01:25:36,900 --> 01:25:40,100
- You should be back in there.
- No, I'm looking for a little boy...

1192
01:25:40,500 --> 01:25:44,600
- Red Cross people will find him.
- No, he's my responsibility.

1193
01:25:44,800 --> 01:25:47,200
Everybody out.
We're evacuating the Hard Rock.

1194
01:25:47,400 --> 01:25:50,100
All right, people, evacuate.
We must leave right now.

1195
01:25:50,300 --> 01:25:53,200
Put down what you're doing. Let's move...

1196
01:26:02,600 --> 01:26:05,700
Come on, let's go. Coming through.

1197
01:26:05,900 --> 01:26:08,300
- Is the building empty?
- Yeah, all clear!

1198
01:26:08,500 --> 01:26:12,500
We're toldlarge amounts
of explosives are being brought in

1199
01:26:12,700 --> 01:26:16,800
from National Guard armouries,
private contractors and LAPD depots.

1200
01:26:17,100 --> 01:26:19,600
It's an extraordinary effort under way...

1201
01:26:19,800 --> 01:26:20,800
Mommy!

1202
01:26:27,000 --> 01:26:28,600
Tommy!

1203
01:26:31,100 --> 01:26:33,100
Tommy!

1204
01:26:33,200 --> 01:26:36,800
This urgent advisory
from the city's Emergency Operations Centre.

1205
01:26:37,000 --> 01:26:40,400
Stay inside and stay away from the window.

1206
01:26:48,200 --> 01:26:52,500
Stay clear of the Beverly Center.

1207
01:26:52,800 --> 01:26:55,500
They put some kids in the mall.
In the Hard Rock.

1208
01:26:55,700 --> 01:26:59,700
- OK, you've done your duty. Can we go now?
- D'you think she might still be there?

1209
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:03,300
Maybe. She was watching some children.
Norman, hold this. What we got?

1210
01:27:03,500 --> 01:27:04,600
Thank you.

1211
01:27:04,800 --> 01:27:06,200
Here. Take this.

1212
01:27:06,300 --> 01:27:11,000
These people are strangers, Jaye.
Are you gonna die for them?

1213
01:27:11,300 --> 01:27:15,700
- Jaye! Answer me!
- I am answering you, Norman.

1214
01:27:15,900 --> 01:27:18,900
This man's in cardiac arrest. I'm defibrillating!

1215
01:27:19,200 --> 01:27:21,000
- Charging.
- Shit!

1216
01:27:21,200 --> 01:27:22,800
- Clear!
- I'm outta here.

1217
01:27:25,600 --> 01:27:27,200
Not much time. Hurry up.

1218
01:27:27,400 --> 01:27:32,200
An amazing scene here,
as demolition teams pour into the area.

1219
01:27:34,000 --> 01:27:39,700
Ifyou live in the Beverly Centerarea,
stay inside and away from the windows.

1220
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:43,100
- Kelly Roark!
- Expecta series of explosions.

1221
01:27:43,300 --> 01:27:46,400
- Kelly Roark!
- Beware of flying glass.

1222
01:27:46,700 --> 01:27:49,200
Kelly! Kelly Roark!

1223
01:27:49,400 --> 01:27:52,100
- Lou! Are you set?
- Ready.

1224
01:27:52,300 --> 01:27:53,800
Danny, are you all ready?

1225
01:27:54,000 --> 01:27:56,500
Here it comes.

1226
01:27:56,700 --> 01:27:59,000
- Ten seconds away.
- You haven't got ten seconds!

1227
01:28:00,700 --> 01:28:02,600
It's coming! It's coming!

1228
01:28:04,700 --> 01:28:06,500
Everybody out! Everybody out!

1229
01:28:06,700 --> 01:28:11,200
- Get outta here! Move it! Move it!
- Come on, come on!

1230
01:28:11,400 --> 01:28:12,700
- Give me a hand!
- Put them in.

1231
01:28:13,700 --> 01:28:15,200
We gotta move, buddy!

1232
01:28:20,300 --> 01:28:22,000
It's gonna blow! It's gonna blow!

1233
01:28:34,900 --> 01:28:35,700
I'm done!

1234
01:28:59,800 --> 01:29:02,500
- Whoa!
- Where the...

1235
01:29:02,700 --> 01:29:04,100
My God.

1236
01:29:04,300 --> 01:29:06,600
This is just an incredible scene.

1237
01:29:06,800 --> 01:29:09,900
We are watching a stampede desperately...

1238
01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:11,200
Someone...

1239
01:29:12,600 --> 01:29:13,700
Some...

1240
01:29:32,400 --> 01:29:35,100
My leg. I think it's busted. Get me outta here.

1241
01:29:39,300 --> 01:29:40,400
It's broken.

1242
01:29:47,500 --> 01:29:50,100
Kelly Roark!

1243
01:29:50,300 --> 01:29:52,900
Kelly Roark!

1244
01:29:56,300 --> 01:29:57,000
Tommy.

1245
01:29:57,600 --> 01:30:00,800
Start detonation sequence.

1246
01:30:01,000 --> 01:30:02,300
Aaahh!

1247
01:30:05,800 --> 01:30:07,200
It isn't gonna budge.

1248
01:30:07,400 --> 01:30:11,000
- Get outta here. You'll make it, ifyou run.
- I won't leave a man down.

1249
01:30:11,200 --> 01:30:13,300
I'm gonna get you outta here, pal.

1250
01:30:16,000 --> 01:30:17,900
- La Cienega, we clear?
- La Cienega clear.

1251
01:30:18,100 --> 01:30:20,400
- Lower San Vicente?
- Lower San Vicente all clear.

1252
01:30:20,600 --> 01:30:23,000
- Upper San Vicente?
- Upper San Vicente all clear.

1253
01:30:23,200 --> 01:30:25,000
Tower, can we go?

1254
01:30:26,600 --> 01:30:29,000
We have to go. Irepeat, are we clear?

1255
01:30:29,200 --> 01:30:34,900
I gotall hell breaking loose up here.
We gotta go now. Irepeat, are we clear?

1256
01:30:35,300 --> 01:30:37,100
- Tower clear.
- I copy.

1257
01:30:38,800 --> 01:30:39,300
Go!

1258
01:30:56,000 --> 01:30:59,200
Hold it. There's a kid out there.
There's a kid out there.

1259
01:30:59,400 --> 01:31:02,000
There's a kid out there in San Vicente, hold it!

1260
01:31:04,500 --> 01:31:05,300
Tommy!

1261
01:31:07,700 --> 01:31:12,200
Get outta there! Kelly, get outta there!
Abort! Abort!

1262
01:31:12,500 --> 01:31:14,300
Stop the explosions!

1263
01:31:57,800 --> 01:31:59,900
A skyscraper20-storeys'high...

1264
01:32:01,700 --> 01:32:02,700
Dad!

1265
01:32:04,000 --> 01:32:06,100
Get out! Kelly, get outta there!

1266
01:32:25,100 --> 01:32:28,600
As faras we can tell
through the clouds of rubble,

1267
01:32:28,800 --> 01:32:31,300
this audacious plan seems to be working.

1268
01:32:31,500 --> 01:32:35,300
Officials are breathing
their first sigh of relief in hours

1269
01:32:35,600 --> 01:32:38,200
as this strategy looks like it's paying off.

1270
01:32:38,500 --> 01:32:42,000
In the triage area there is rejoicing.

1271
01:32:42,300 --> 01:32:43,700
Mike Roark?

1272
01:32:46,000 --> 01:32:48,000
Mike Roark, are you there?

1273
01:32:50,100 --> 01:32:50,700
Mike?

1274
01:32:50,800 --> 01:32:55,300
You can see through the dust
there is an atmosphere of celebration here.

1275
01:32:55,600 --> 01:33:00,200
People are laughing andsmiling,
feeling a sense of more than just relief.

1276
01:33:00,500 --> 01:33:05,200
And about200 feetawayis a 20-storey
apartment building lying on its side...

1277
01:33:05,500 --> 01:33:07,500
Roark!

1278
01:33:07,700 --> 01:33:09,600
Roark, can you hear me?

1279
01:33:09,800 --> 01:33:10,600
Roark!

1280
01:33:10,700 --> 01:33:13,300
Roark, can you hear me?

1281
01:33:13,600 --> 01:33:16,300
Flow is at Crescent Heights and turning.

1282
01:33:16,400 --> 01:33:18,400
The trench is holding.

1283
01:33:18,600 --> 01:33:21,300
The flow is down the storm drain.

1284
01:33:21,500 --> 01:33:24,700
The re-routing through the storm drains
seems to be holding.

1285
01:33:27,400 --> 01:33:28,800
Roark!

1286
01:33:29,500 --> 01:33:30,800
Roark!

1287
01:33:31,000 --> 01:33:34,800
- Approaching Wilshire intersection.
- Passing under the 10.

1288
01:33:34,900 --> 01:33:38,000
We can see that fiery flow
moving along the creek.

1289
01:33:38,300 --> 01:33:43,100
The concrete walls are holding up against
the lava as it streams towards the Pacific.

1290
01:33:46,600 --> 01:33:48,400
Roark!

1291
01:33:48,500 --> 01:33:49,900
Roark!

1292
01:33:50,100 --> 01:33:52,100
Roark!

1293
01:34:00,600 --> 01:34:02,700
Roark!

1294
01:34:03,500 --> 01:34:05,100
Hey!

1295
01:34:05,200 --> 01:34:07,000
- Roark!
- Over here!

1296
01:34:40,200 --> 01:34:43,000
I just got word on Mike. He's OK.

1297
01:34:43,300 --> 01:34:45,500
His little girl, too. Roark is OK.

1298
01:34:45,700 --> 01:34:48,800
Thanks. Yes.

1299
01:34:51,400 --> 01:34:53,600
And itis goodnews atlast.

1300
01:34:54,300 --> 01:34:57,200
Satellite pictures show
the volcano is shutting down.

1301
01:34:57,400 --> 01:34:59,400
The lava is subsiding.

1302
01:34:59,600 --> 01:35:03,500
This maybe the first chance
for stunned Angelinos to finally look around

1303
01:35:03,800 --> 01:35:05,000
and take stock,

1304
01:35:05,100 --> 01:35:09,300
for, with nearly 100 dead, thousands injured
and damage in the billions,

1305
01:35:09,400 --> 01:35:12,900
this crisis has surely touched everyone ofus.

1306
01:35:13,200 --> 01:35:15,400
Let's go find your mom. What she look like?

1307
01:35:16,600 --> 01:35:18,700
She looks like...

1308
01:35:24,100 --> 01:35:25,600
Look at their faces.

1309
01:35:28,300 --> 01:35:30,100
They all look the same.

1310
01:35:49,100 --> 01:35:50,900
Yeah!

1311
01:35:52,600 --> 01:35:53,900
Whoo!

1312
01:36:04,100 --> 01:36:05,000
Well,

1313
01:36:06,800 --> 01:36:10,200
had I been in charge,
I would have evacuated the West Side,

1314
01:36:10,500 --> 01:36:15,100
sacrificed half the city, maybe made
parking a little easier in Beverly Hills, but

1315
01:36:15,400 --> 01:36:16,800
I would have been wrong.

1316
01:36:16,900 --> 01:36:20,800
If you'd been in charge, we'd have
known about it 24 hours in advance.

1317
01:36:21,000 --> 01:36:22,600
You saved a lot of lives today.

1318
01:36:22,800 --> 01:36:25,800
Aw, shucks, Roark.

1319
01:36:37,500 --> 01:36:39,900
I let the guy outta my sight for one minute.

1320
01:36:41,100 --> 01:36:44,700
Max, go! Go!

1321
01:36:44,900 --> 01:36:47,800
Kelly, look who we brought you.

1322
01:36:48,000 --> 01:36:51,000
- Max! Oh!
- Hey, Maxie.

1323
01:36:55,000 --> 01:36:58,200
- Just another day at the office, huh?
- Yeah!

1324
01:36:58,300 --> 01:36:59,200
Mr Roark!

1325
01:36:59,400 --> 01:37:02,600
We've got a phone call for you.
It's Chief Sindelar.

1326
01:37:02,800 --> 01:37:04,300
Yeah, just a moment.

1327
01:37:04,500 --> 01:37:08,200
- He finally made it in, huh?
- Yeah.

1328
01:37:08,400 --> 01:37:11,100
Says we got mud slides in Malibu.

1329
01:37:11,400 --> 01:37:14,900
A couple of hundred structural fires,
power's down over half the city,

1330
01:37:15,000 --> 01:37:19,000
gridlock on all of the freeways.
Hope you got some bright ideas for this.

1331
01:37:19,200 --> 01:37:20,400
I do.

1332
01:37:21,100 --> 01:37:23,500
You handle it. I'm on vacation.

1333
01:37:23,700 --> 01:37:25,700
I'm going home with my daughter.

1334
01:37:29,200 --> 01:37:30,200
Come on, Max!

1335
01:37:31,300 --> 01:37:35,200
You know, I could get used to this, Mike.

1336
01:37:35,500 --> 01:37:38,300
All right, let's go. Hello, Chief.

1337
01:37:38,500 --> 01:37:39,900
No, it's still Emmit.

1338
01:37:40,100 --> 01:37:45,200
I know. I don't know what to tell you. It's not
personal. Yes, it's raining here, too, sir.

1339
01:37:45,500 --> 01:37:47,900
Guys, it's a little wet out here. You want a lift?

1340
01:37:48,100 --> 01:37:49,700
Yeah.

1341
01:37:50,900 --> 01:37:55,000
Well, you said you wanted to go
to the Beverly Center. How did you like it?

1342
01:37:55,300 --> 01:37:56,400
Huh?

1343
01:37:56,500 --> 01:37:59,100
It was cool, Dad.

1344
01:37:59,400 --> 01:38:01,400
- Cool?
- Cool.
