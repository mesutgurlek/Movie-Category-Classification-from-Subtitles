1
00:00:02,880 --> 00:00:04,526
Can I get everyone's attention?

2
00:00:06,565 --> 00:00:08,324
Mr. Williams, please rise.

3
00:00:09,693 --> 00:00:11,674
Please raise your right hand, sir.

4
00:00:12,202 --> 00:00:16,086
Do you solemnly swear that the testimony
you about to give is the truth.

5
00:00:16,287 --> 00:00:19,495
the whole truth and nothing but the truth.
So help you God.

6
00:00:19,696 --> 00:00:22,117
- Yes sir. - Thank you, sir. You be seated.

7
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:28,754
Mr. Williams, can you
please give us your best

8
00:00:28,779 --> 00:00:31,440
recollection of the event
on the Deepwater Horizon?

9
00:00:33,728 --> 00:00:37,449
I was on the phone
 around 9:30 with my wife.

10
00:00:37,650 --> 00:00:39,328
That's when I heard the hissing noise.

11
00:00:41,287 --> 00:00:43,723
I heard the engines start to rave.

12
00:00:44,459 --> 00:00:47,155
The hissing turn into a full blown roar.

13
00:00:47,357 --> 00:00:49,364
Higher than I can even describe it.

14
00:00:49,566 --> 00:00:52,388
And within second there's a huge explosion.

15
00:00:53,127 --> 00:00:55,466
Projectiles coming from everywhere.

16
00:00:55,768 --> 00:00:57,365
The heat was overwhelming.

17
00:00:59,465 --> 00:01:04,310
Can you please tell me how the
Deepwater Horizon alarm system is set up.

18
00:01:05,367 --> 00:01:08,729
The general alarm is set
up to inform the entire rig of

19
00:01:08,930 --> 00:01:12,336
Number one fire,
number two combustible gas.

20
00:01:12,537 --> 00:01:14,067
Number three toxic gas.

21
00:01:14,268 --> 00:01:18,628
Each condition has a
distinct tone and a distinct visual light.

22
00:01:19,771 --> 00:01:21,483
On the eve of April 20th

23
00:01:21,684 --> 00:01:24,597
Did you hear anyone of
those alarm on Deepwater Horizon?

24
00:01:24,798 --> 00:01:26,106
No sir.

25
00:01:27,382 --> 00:01:30,442
Do you know why you never heard that alarm?

26
00:01:32,988 --> 00:01:33,988
Mr. William?

27
00:01:34,498 --> 00:01:36,005
Mr. William?

28
00:01:36,006 --> 00:01:41,614
DEEP HORIZON

29
00:02:17,006 --> 00:02:19,057
Passing 3000 feet.

30
00:02:30,375 --> 00:02:31,880
Continuing down.

31
00:02:33,314 --> 00:02:36,000
Need to stick to the north side far east.

32
00:02:36,302 --> 00:02:37,807
Scan on it.

33
00:02:48,257 --> 00:02:50,675
About 500 foot rising up.

34
00:02:53,667 --> 00:02:55,438
BOP is in the view.

35
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:59,683
Blowout Preventer (BOP)

36
00:02:59,883 --> 00:03:02,331
PRESSURE WELL CONTROL AND RISK FAILURE

37
00:03:02,532 --> 00:03:07,975
Drilling depth 5.6 kilometers.

38
00:03:09,002 --> 00:03:11,623
How's that wellhead service working?

39
00:03:12,425 --> 00:03:16,330
Minor corrosion not much more
than I expected of. Well ahead of it's age.

40
00:03:16,632 --> 00:03:18,934
Allright working. Crank it up.

41
00:04:00,337 --> 00:04:03,175
I just had the craziest dream.

42
00:04:05,541 --> 00:04:06,998
Wow.

43
00:04:08,180 --> 00:04:11,509
Wow...wow was I in it.

44
00:04:11,710 --> 00:04:15,025
I was no...I was at a concert.

45
00:04:16,651 --> 00:04:18,827
and then on the side of the
stage there was this two-legged rabbit.

46
00:04:19,029 --> 00:04:21,043
I don't want no part of it. I want tap out.

47
00:04:21,245 --> 00:04:22,358
Listen to me.

48
00:04:23,067 --> 00:04:24,116
Listen to me.

49
00:04:25,555 --> 00:04:26,858
I would moved.

50
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:31,639
and then he would
mimic everthing I was doing.

51
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:34,429
Don't tell me anymore
 because I know where this is going.

52
00:04:36,486 --> 00:04:39,750
- You think the rabbit was my mother.
- Mother. Yes I know.

53
00:04:39,952 --> 00:04:43,427
I think it was my worst nightmare.
Thank you.

54
00:04:43,628 --> 00:04:45,434
- It was hostile. - Ok.

55
00:04:45,635 --> 00:04:48,204
- It was a hostile rabbit. - I got it.

56
00:04:49,555 --> 00:04:51,688
I'm sorry. What are you doing?

57
00:04:52,294 --> 00:04:56,098
That it? That's how you
going to leave me for 21 day's next.

58
00:04:56,300 --> 00:04:57,592
I want you get your sleep.

59
00:04:57,894 --> 00:05:01,477
Well I need other things beside sleep.

60
00:05:01,679 --> 00:05:03,980
You have to promise
not to bring your mother then.

61
00:05:05,681 --> 00:05:06,702
Hmmm

62
00:05:07,103 --> 00:05:09,502
So you want the thirty?

63
00:05:10,103 --> 00:05:11,286
The sixty?

64
00:05:11,487 --> 00:05:13,582
Or the ninety seconds package?

65
00:05:13,783 --> 00:05:15,545
I'm going to take the whole ninety.

66
00:05:16,344 --> 00:05:20,037
Pressure. Pressure. Pressure.

67
00:05:21,786 --> 00:05:23,624
I gonna miss that laugh.

68
00:05:24,211 --> 00:05:26,458
- That mouth.

69
00:05:32,233 --> 00:05:33,819
Give me those eyes.

70
00:05:51,122 --> 00:05:52,377
I love you.

71
00:06:06,613 --> 00:06:08,449
This is not our deal, dude.

72
00:06:20,475 --> 00:06:22,191
Allright. Allright.

73
00:06:29,643 --> 00:06:32,434
You can see you obviously
overestimating your skills as a mechanic.

74
00:06:34,551 --> 00:06:35,652
What was that?

75
00:06:37,066 --> 00:06:38,192
Let's go baby.

76
00:06:38,414 --> 00:06:39,660
- Let me drive. - Uh uh.

77
00:06:40,162 --> 00:06:41,401
- Let me drive. - Nope.

78
00:06:41,502 --> 00:06:43,124
- Let me drive. - Nope.

79
00:06:45,444 --> 00:06:46,463
Pretty please.

80
00:06:46,669 --> 00:06:48,231
- You really want to drive? - Yeah.

81
00:06:48,444 --> 00:06:50,662
Then sell that piece of shit
and get a Ducatti.

82
00:07:02,612 --> 00:07:05,837
Wow. Builder not trying to shop.

83
00:07:11,410 --> 00:07:14,577
I only didn't not knock
because I want a brother.

84
00:07:15,397 --> 00:07:17,356
Okay. That's disturbing.

85
00:07:17,557 --> 00:07:19,515
You're not supposed to
know anything about that.

86
00:07:19,844 --> 00:07:21,517
You're supposed to
just think babies are cute.

87
00:07:21,718 --> 00:07:24,124
- Will you sit down please?
- Really I want a brother.

88
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:26,660
How's it going?

89
00:07:26,861 --> 00:07:28,902
- Honey, show daddy. - I'm not done yet.

90
00:07:29,103 --> 00:07:30,779
- You did such a good job. - It's showtime.

91
00:07:30,980 --> 00:07:32,368
It's really great.

92
00:07:33,307 --> 00:07:34,632
You can't look at me.

93
00:07:34,833 --> 00:07:36,844
- Why? - Because it makes
me feel uncomfortable.

94
00:07:37,045 --> 00:07:39,583
- Am i looking at you
makes you uncomfortable?

95
00:07:39,785 --> 00:07:41,145
Stop. My dad is Mike.

96
00:07:41,347 --> 00:07:45,121
He works in a drilling rig that
pumps oil out from underneath the ocean.

97
00:07:45,323 --> 00:07:48,915
No, no the Deepwater doesn't pump a
drop of oil okay. We're the explorers.

98
00:07:49,117 --> 00:07:51,357
So my dad and his friend finds the oil

99
00:07:51,559 --> 00:07:54,821
and then puts it in all the plumbing
so other lamer cruise can come in

100
00:07:55,022 --> 00:07:56,554
- Don't say lamer - They're lamer.

101
00:07:56,755 --> 00:08:00,147
Okay listen even those lamer dudes, they
don't have to pump anything, remember.

102
00:08:00,348 --> 00:08:02,101
Because the oil comes rushing out at you.

103
00:08:02,303 --> 00:08:03,690
- No no no - Allright, allright allright.

104
00:08:03,892 --> 00:08:06,013
Because that oil is a monster.

105
00:08:06,315 --> 00:08:09,460
Like the mean old dinosaur
all that oil used to be.

106
00:08:09,661 --> 00:08:11,903
So for 300 million years ...

107
00:08:12,104 --> 00:08:16,282
these old dinosaurs have been getting
squeeze tighter and tighter tighter

108
00:08:16,483 --> 00:08:18,587
We get it. Just use two tighter.

109
00:08:18,789 --> 00:08:21,958
Cause they got a miles of earth
and ocean pressing down on them.

110
00:08:22,159 --> 00:08:24,167
They are trapped under it.

111
00:08:24,368 --> 00:08:27,187
So Dad and his friends
make a hole on their roof.

112
00:08:29,313 --> 00:08:30,037
Yeah!

113
00:08:30,242 --> 00:08:32,413
And these mean old dinosaurs
can't believe it.

114
00:08:32,615 --> 00:08:35,356
So they rush to the new hole. Then smack.

115
00:08:35,557 --> 00:08:38,207
They ran into a big machine that
he and his friends pump down

116
00:08:38,408 --> 00:08:40,550
from the ocean floor called

117
00:08:40,751 --> 00:08:43,136
- Big guy preventer? - Blowout preventer.

118
00:08:43,437 --> 00:08:46,015
They run into this stuff called mud.

119
00:08:46,116 --> 00:08:48,563
- Allright get it in there.
But they cramp on the straw.

120
00:08:48,862 --> 00:08:51,952
The mud is so thick and heavy it
blocks the monster from coming out.

121
00:08:52,254 --> 00:08:54,384
And then they sail away to the next.

122
00:08:54,586 --> 00:08:57,624
That's when all the lame-o showed
up all happy like they did something.

123
00:08:57,825 --> 00:08:58,825
Don't say lame-o.

124
00:08:58,969 --> 00:09:01,693
But it was my daddy who
tamed the dinosaurs.

125
00:09:01,894 --> 00:09:03,374
- Yeah! - Yeah.

126
00:09:04,307 --> 00:09:06,582
That was amazing. Stay 10 forever please.

127
00:09:06,783 --> 00:09:08,589
Daddy you need to get me a fossil.

128
00:09:08,590 --> 00:09:09,491
I will.

129
00:09:09,592 --> 00:09:13,696
I want to be able to put it up and
say my daddy tamed the dinosaurs.

130
00:09:15,071 --> 00:09:16,566
Tell daddy what Maggie's dad did.

131
00:09:16,767 --> 00:09:20,329
Her dad works at the zoo and
he brought a real penguin.

132
00:09:20,830 --> 00:09:22,166
You can't do that!

133
00:09:22,310 --> 00:09:24,897
- He brought a penguin.
- How do you compete with a penguin?

134
00:09:24,898 --> 00:09:27,380
- You get a fossil.
- There should be rules.

135
00:09:29,275 --> 00:09:31,074
Oh my God.

136
00:09:31,475 --> 00:09:32,557
What?

137
00:09:32,758 --> 00:09:34,445
- The hole is so much for the can.
- Stop it!

138
00:09:35,515 --> 00:09:36,916
Calm it.

139
00:10:05,682 --> 00:10:07,906
Buy gas go to work ...

140
00:10:08,007 --> 00:10:10,890
Buy gas back to work.

141
00:10:11,091 --> 00:10:13,335
Buy more gas get to work.

142
00:10:13,536 --> 00:10:15,982
Hey, you know the password right with
all the insurance stuff, agent and all.

143
00:10:16,184 --> 00:10:18,477
- Call Schuman first.
- What are you talking about? - I just...

144
00:10:20,278 --> 00:10:24,100
- What are you on about? - I just got spook
on going home on a chopper last August.

145
00:10:24,301 --> 00:10:25,002
Give me some of that.

146
00:10:25,203 --> 00:10:29,094
Babe the only time you start worrying about
a marine is when he stops bitching.

147
00:10:29,195 --> 00:10:31,568
- Don't use my line against me.
- I'm using your line against you.

148
00:10:31,770 --> 00:10:33,409
- Don't use my line. - I just did.

149
00:10:34,010 --> 00:10:36,440


150
00:10:59,306 --> 00:11:05,133


151
00:11:09,759 --> 00:11:12,384
- Allright bread.
-Allright, fish.

152
00:11:13,125 --> 00:11:15,193


153
00:11:16,343 --> 00:11:18,866
- See you in three weeks.

154
00:11:18,967 --> 00:11:20,559
Behave.

155
00:11:22,876 --> 00:11:23,939
Next.

156
00:11:24,496 --> 00:11:26,843
- Good morning, Mr. Jimmy.
- How are we doing Sarah?

157
00:11:26,944 --> 00:11:28,257
- Good, how are you doing? - All yeah.

158
00:11:28,458 --> 00:11:31,211
You can place you bag on the
baggage scale up and step on your feet.

159
00:11:31,412 --> 00:11:34,069
- Where you heading today?
- Same place. Deepwater Horizon.

160
00:11:34,270 --> 00:11:35,907
- Where you flying to? - Deepwater Horizon.

161
00:11:36,108 --> 00:11:37,905

00:12:04,006 --> 00:12:06,585

00:14:45,562 --> 00:14:48,207
Deepwater Horizon is only a mile out.

213
00:14:48,609 --> 00:14:52,339
We should be fine to land.

214
00:14:53,232 --> 00:14:56,066
We'll run a safety check there.

215
00:14:56,167 --> 00:14:57,413
If anything that big ought to be made by God.

216
00:14:57,484 --> 00:15:00,314
That's beautiful. - You know it's not on a stilt it's not jackup.

217

00:15:18,001 --> 00:15:19,509

00:16:34,961 --> 00:16:37,023
- What did he say? - I can't hear him.

239
00:16:50,195 --> 00:16:51,727
What did Mr. Skip say?

240
00:16:51,928 --> 00:16:54,765
They were supposed to test to see whether the cement was holding.

241
00:16:54,966 --> 00:16:56,401
I guess they left without doing it.

242
00:16:56,702 --> 00:16:58,552
What?

243
00:16:58,753 --> 00:17:01,699

- Skip saying anything to you about running the cement log? - He didn't call me.

253
00:17:25,434 --> 00:17:28,255
We're in a war here and I'm just now finding out about it?

254
00:17:28,456 --> 00:17:33,267
Cause I'm sure don't know how they have the time to do a cement test cause they're flying away.

255
00:17:33,468 --> 00:17:35,940
- Shit Jimmy i just drive the boat man. - How that positive test go?

256
00:17:36,141 --> 00:17:37,981
Positive test clear. We're in rig down mode.

257
00:17:38,182 --> 00:17:39,541
- Rig down mode - How are we looking?

258
00:17:39,742 --> 00:17:42,213

259
00:17:42,414 --> 00:17:43,420
The sea is calm as good.

260
00:17:51,324 --> 00:17:53,274


261
00:17:53,475 --> 00:17:55,701
Are you still dating that itsy bitsy guy with the motorcycle?

262
00:17:56,724 --> 00:17:58,615
- Any issue with the thruster? - Andrea.

263
00:17:58,716 --> 00:17:59,417
Yes sir?

264
00:17:59,518 --> 00:18:04,024

265
00:18:04,325 --> 00:18:05,457
You got it, Mr. Jimmy.

266
00:18:05,759 --> 00:18:09,044
Damon Bankston, this is Deepwater Horizon, over.

267
00:18:10,664 --> 00:18:13,344
Deepwater Horizon, this is Damon Bankston, go ahead.

268
00:18:13,545 --> 00:18:15,446
Damon I wants to know what you doing here.

269
00:18:15,648 --> 00:18:19,937
Over here we're getting off this beast and moving on to the next.

270
00:18:20,138 --> 00:18:22,741
You can call it a bitch. When are we supposed to be leaving?

271
00:18:22,942 --> 00:18:26,185
Well I'm told to be ready to start taking on drilling mud about 18:00

272
00:18:26,286 --> 00:18:27,286
Wow.

273
00:18:27,908 --> 00:18:30,217
I heard about the positive pressure test this morning.

274
00:18:30,519 --> 00:18:32,920
They guess the negative test is going to run just as smooth.

275
00:18:33,121 --> 00:18:35,659
- They told me to get ready to start moving on. - Who's they?

276
00:18:35,861 --> 00:18:39,511
BP company men. Vidrine, Kaluza.

277
00:18:39,712 --> 00:18:43,222
I wait for the order and come pick up your mud. Any other question?

278
00:18:43,323 --> 00:18:44,773
No, that's it.

279
00:18:45,074 --> 00:18:50,496
So BP company men Vidrine and Kaluza are hoping that we have tamed this bitch

280
00:18:50,698 --> 00:18:54,684
and are ready to displace drilling mud at 1800 hours is that correct, Captain?

281
00:18:54,985 --> 00:18:57,178
That is correct. Morning Mr. Jimmy.

282
00:18:57,280 --> 00:19:00,213
All the sudden. Just like that.

283
00:19:00,414 --> 00:19:01,617
Thank you, Captain.

284
00:19:04,263 --> 00:19:06,917
And the goddamn phone still don't work, Mike.

285
00:19:07,119 --> 00:19:08,540
Hey, I flew with you Mr. Jimmy.

286
00:19:08,741 --> 00:19:10,939
Can you do me a favor run down to the drill shack

287
00:19:11,140 --> 00:19:15,338
And ask Jason if those Schlumberger guys did their job. If they run the cement log.

288
00:19:16,110 --> 00:19:17,442
Roger that.

289
00:19:17,643 --> 00:19:18,444
Thank you.

290
00:19:18,545 --> 00:19:23,394
Gentlemen, you couldn't perhaps enlighten me on the cement log situation, could you?

291
00:19:24,686 --> 00:19:25,754
Cement log?

292
00:19:26,355 --> 00:19:29,143
You know if they're planning it? Running it? Did it?

293
00:19:29,745 --> 00:19:31,061
Yeah?

294
00:19:31,819 --> 00:19:33,426
Not really. Hey, Ronnie.

295
00:19:33,628 --> 00:19:35,880
Might be the ignition problem on your Mustang.

296
00:19:36,081 --> 00:19:37,683
I'm seeing it maybe failed plug.

297
00:19:37,884 --> 00:19:39,939
Could be a wire. Could be distributer.

298
00:19:40,202 --> 00:19:42,032
- Does it sounds like it skipping? - No.

299
00:19:42,249 --> 00:19:44,305
You know what I'm going to do
for you young lady? You keep

00:19:46,493 --> 00:19:48,026

Do you know me?

304
00:19:51,300 --> 00:19:53,811
Oh you gonna start grinding shit out of that clutch, I know that.

00:19:54,012 --> 00:19:56,162

Yeah?

320
00:20:51,379 --> 00:20:53,830
Yeah. We all got woken up guys got us working over.

321
00:20:54,031 --> 00:20:56,725
Got a lot of pipes to pull for if we want to get out of here at night.

322
00:20:56,926 --> 00:20:58,127
What's up with the street clothes? You look pretty.

323
00:20:58,329 --> 00:21:01,524
Aw man, Mr. Jimmy is pissed he wants to know if we got some of that cement bond log test.

324
00:21:01,825 --> 00:21:03,259
I'm not sure. I don't think so.

325
00:21:03,460 --> 00:21:05,001
-No? Hey, Shane! - Yeah?

326
00:21:05,202 --> 00:21:08,080
Come here buddy. Schlumberger run a cement bond log test?

327
00:21:08,281 --> 00:21:11,187
I do not know. I don't think they did it. I just woke up, so ...

328
00:21:11,388 --> 00:21:13,598
- Aren't that stupid? - I  don't know if it's stupid ...

329
00:21:13,799 --> 00:21:15,388
but it ain't smart.

330
00:21:16,291 --> 00:21:18,172
Look at what you guys like synchronized swimmers.

331
00:21:18,373 --> 00:21:20,735
I think if you think too much you going to give him a headache.

332
00:21:20,937 --> 00:21:22,508
- Piped down. - Yes.

333
00:21:22,709 --> 00:21:23,810
Up up.

334
00:21:27,603 --> 00:21:29,396
Fellas

335
00:21:29,598 --> 00:21:31,100
What the hell are you wearing?

336
00:21:31,301 --> 00:21:34,071
Mr. Jimmy wants to know if the Schlumbeger run the cement bond log test.

337
00:21:34,273 --> 00:21:37,185
- The what? - Cement job. Test the cement job. Come on man work with me.

338
00:21:37,387 --> 00:21:39,796
- Who that again? - Cut the shit man come on Jimmy's piss man.

339
00:21:39,929 --> 00:21:42,459
- Schlumberger, you democrat. - Did they run the test?

340
00:21:42,661 --> 00:21:45,480
No, Vidrine and Kaluza sent them home without testing anything.

341
00:21:45,681 --> 00:21:49,368
- Why the hell would they do that? - I don't feel the urge to take me through their thinking Mike.

342
00:21:49,569 --> 00:21:51,444
But I assume it got something to do with...

343
00:21:51,545 --> 00:21:53,787
Money, money, money, money

344
00:21:54,385 --> 00:21:55,834
Money!

345
00:21:55,936 --> 00:21:57,390
The phone is broken.

346
00:21:58,269 --> 00:21:59,427
Shit.

347
00:22:00,602 --> 00:22:01,645
Hey, Mr. Jimmy.

348
00:22:01,846 --> 00:22:02,948
Go ahead.

349
00:22:03,249 --> 00:22:05,844
That BP sent the Schlumberger team home without running any test.

350
00:22:05,945 --> 00:22:08,100
There was no cement bond log.

351
00:22:08,301 --> 00:22:09,492
Thank you, Mike.

352
00:22:11,124 --> 00:22:13,263
Mike, the "A" chair just crash.

353
00:22:13,464 --> 00:22:15,538
- Dammit. - Blue screen of death again.

354
00:22:15,839 --> 00:22:17,614
Hey, Duck, is that chair still up?

355
00:22:17,816 --> 00:22:21,345
My computer screen is shaky and my smoke detector's out.

356
00:22:21,546 --> 00:22:22,642
How you doing, Mike?

357
00:22:22,843 --> 00:22:23,844
Shit.

358
00:22:24,046 --> 00:22:26,428
I double back and grab my tools and I'll be back to fix it.

359
00:22:26,629 --> 00:22:28,702
Doing it all with band-aids and bubble gum my man.

360
00:22:28,903 --> 00:22:31,898
Every time I peel off a band-aid this on this rig i will find three or four more.

361
00:22:32,099 --> 00:22:33,458
Spitting glue ain't getting it done.

362
00:22:33,659 --> 00:22:34,794
One more time with the money. Come on.

363
00:22:34,995 --> 00:22:37,165
- You've been rehearsing for weeks. - Money money...

364
00:22:37,365 --> 00:22:38,436
Nah, nah the good part man.

365
00:22:38,637 --> 00:22:40,797
That is the good part.

366
00:22:40,998 --> 00:22:45,254
It could kill for that money. The almighty dollar.

367
00:22:45,455 --> 00:22:46,474
Hello, Hollywood.

368
00:22:52,849 --> 00:22:54,732
- Mike! - What's the word, Dale ?!

369
00:22:54,932 --> 00:22:57,887
- What do you know? We done? - Not much. Could be.

370
00:22:58,088 --> 00:23:00,361
Yeah I am going fishing tonight. Undercover.

371
00:23:00,563 --> 00:23:03,995
I got a feeling we're not getting off this well tonight I think nobody is going to be doing no fishing.

372
00:23:04,269 --> 00:23:07,353
You going to use your crane man? Maybe catch a beluga or shamu?

373
00:23:07,555 --> 00:23:08,657
Good idea.

374
00:23:08,858 --> 00:23:12,507
Shit. Willing to make a bet we'll hit the same spot next hitch.

375
00:23:12,708 --> 00:23:14,174
- Yeah give me odds? - 50 to one.

376
00:23:14,375 --> 00:23:16,650
Ahh shit. I ain't touching that.

377
00:23:16,852 --> 00:23:19,152
30 to one. Same spot.

378
00:23:19,354 --> 00:23:20,118
No way.

379
00:23:20,319 --> 00:23:22,510
Mike Williams, you cheap bastard.

380
00:24:07,945 --> 00:24:09,322
- Patrick. - What's going on Mike?

381
00:24:09,523 --> 00:24:11,441
- What's the word? - I heard we done.

382
00:24:11,642 --> 00:24:12,822
-We're done? - Yeah.

383
00:24:13,024 --> 00:24:14,997
- Who you heard that from? - I can't tell you all that much.

384
00:24:15,098 --> 00:24:16,281
What do you mean you can't tell me that?

385
00:24:16,382 --> 00:24:17,383
- I just can't tell you. - Why can't you tell me that?

386
00:24:17,585 --> 00:24:20,323
I can not tell you. But I can tell you that Gordon is looking for you.

387
00:24:20,524 --> 00:24:22,491
- Did Gordon tell you that? - No he didn't tell me that.

388
00:24:22,692 --> 00:24:24,705
- What going on then? - I dont know. He got something to show you.

389
00:24:24,906 --> 00:24:26,527
- What do you know? - I know we're done.

390
00:24:27,129 --> 00:24:28,479
Are you on my shop?

391
00:24:29,292 --> 00:24:30,848
- No. - Don't touch my shit.

392
00:24:31,049 --> 00:24:32,923
- I wasn't touching your shit - Go fix something.

393
00:24:33,125 --> 00:24:36,056
- Have a good day, Mike. - You too. Shit.

394
00:24:40,636 --> 00:24:42,013
Wait babe hold on.

395
00:24:43,554 --> 00:24:44,554
What were you saying?

396
00:24:44,721 --> 00:24:47,112
Great news. Chopper didn't crash.

397
00:24:47,313 --> 00:24:49,989
Shit, I assumed and then i remarried.

398
00:24:50,090 --> 00:24:52,859
Oh yeah he rich?

399
00:24:53,060 --> 00:24:56,116
What yo momma always said "Just as easy to marry a rich man Felicia honey"

400
00:24:56,317 --> 00:24:59,171
If I had a nickel for every dumb shit my mom said...

401
00:24:59,372 --> 00:25:03,189
I wouldn't need a rich man.You gotta fix this by the way.

402
00:25:03,390 --> 00:25:05,994
I'm going to fix it as soon as I get home. Don't worry.

403
00:25:06,395 --> 00:25:07,809
Hey come closer to the computer.

404
00:25:08,609 --> 00:25:09,849
Come over to the computer.

405
00:25:10,524 --> 00:25:11,663
Show me those eyes.

406
00:25:11,964 --> 00:25:13,159
How's everything?

407
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:15,004
Same shit. Well from hell.

408
00:25:16,186 --> 00:25:18,401
You ready? - Three.

409
00:25:18,602 --> 00:25:19,602
Two ...

410
00:25:19,704 --> 00:25:21,006
- One ... - Go!

411
00:25:24,297 --> 00:25:25,621
That face.

412
00:25:26,846 --> 00:25:28,278
Sociopath.

413
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:32,760
That is focus. That is determination. That is intensity. Drive.

414
00:25:37,576 --> 00:25:40,176
- Hah. - I knew you. I hate it.

415
00:25:40,777 --> 00:25:43,262
- I'll see you soon, okay? - Allright. See you.

416
00:25:45,327 --> 00:25:47,009
Who's touching my shit?

417
00:25:47,411 --> 00:25:50,845
Dont'touch my shit. Don't touch my shit.

418
00:25:51,798 --> 00:25:53,896
Can I tell you where to hit on our next location?

419
00:25:54,507 --> 00:25:55,642
Kaskida.

420
00:25:56,243 --> 00:25:59,952
Was this run by anybody BP? Kaluza. Vidrine, anybody?

421
00:26:00,153 --> 00:26:02,673
Vidrine right about me. He's come from Virginia.

422
00:26:05,028 --> 00:26:08,208
Bob, let me impose upon you what I think is most important here.

423
00:26:08,409 --> 00:26:12,802
We need to go to Macondo to Kaskida by 16 May.

424
00:26:13,003 --> 00:26:14,954
Kaskida is non-common prospect.

425
00:26:15,156 --> 00:26:18,781
3 to 4 billion barrels. That worth more than BP itself.

426
00:26:18,983 --> 00:26:20,278
Do I look like fucking Santa Claus?

427
00:26:21,180 --> 00:26:23,063
You do look a little like Santa Claus.

428
00:26:24,609 --> 00:26:28,171
Coach Miles may played in Michigan but that boy got Lousiana soul.

429
00:26:28,373 --> 00:26:30,380
That's cause we win dummy.

430
00:26:30,581 --> 00:26:33,013
Same we like you went to Alabama

431
00:26:33,114 --> 00:26:33,897
Did I ask you?

432
00:26:34,098 --> 00:26:37,701
When I was potty training I was taught to flush way before I see you in Tuscaloosa.

433
00:26:37,902 --> 00:26:40,293
You boys working for the government? Clean the clean room.

434
00:26:40,495 --> 00:26:45,235
We're still clearing mud from our last gig. Over 5000 psi. Grab a mop.

435
00:26:46,454 --> 00:26:47,690
That's just crazy.

436
00:26:47,892 --> 00:26:50,742
Look at the pressure did to this drill string during the kick.

437
00:26:50,944 --> 00:26:52,245
That's one for the trophy case.

438
00:26:52,548 --> 00:26:54,700
True that. - Hey Patrick said you got something for me?

439
00:26:54,802 --> 00:26:58,544
Yes sir. Before you all took off last time shaky four goes down

440
00:26:58,746 --> 00:27:01,932
after poking around we finally found the source of the problem.

441
00:27:02,133 --> 00:27:05,378
Check this out. I've been hiding this for you since your last hitch.

442
00:27:08,105 --> 00:27:09,316
Is that a tooth?

443
00:27:10,528 --> 00:27:13,087
Ho buddy you just made my little girl's year.

444
00:27:13,288 --> 00:27:15,776
And to her old man. Thank you. I owe you man.

445
00:27:21,549 --> 00:27:23,137
Well, let's put together the kelly.

446
00:27:23,338 --> 00:27:25,222
Hey, Gordon.

447
00:27:26,043 --> 00:27:28,777
Hey, Jason I'm telling you man, it's going to be full-on shift tonight.

448
00:27:28,978 --> 00:27:30,538
They sent him home.

449
00:27:30,740 --> 00:27:31,740
Yeah.

450
00:27:34,441 --> 00:27:36,057
Walk with me, Mike.

451
00:27:36,258 --> 00:27:38,655
- Where we headed? - Murder some BP company men.

452
00:27:38,856 --> 00:27:41,257
- Shit I got hammer, screwdriver. - Excellent.

453
00:27:42,673 --> 00:27:46,120
Say Mike, do you brush your teeth this morning?

454
00:27:46,172 --> 00:27:47,045
Yes sir.

455
00:27:47,174 --> 00:27:49,149
Boy, did you floss?

456
00:27:49,451 --> 00:27:50,744
No, no why?

457
00:27:51,046 --> 00:27:53,907
Save you a lot of pain and money in the long run I tell you.

458
00:27:54,846 --> 00:27:58,415
- Oh shit Jimmy oh we about to go murder BP guys. - They never ran the cement log.

459
00:27:58,617 --> 00:28:01,082
They sent them home and we're doing shit now we going after the BP.

460
00:28:01,283 --> 00:28:03,196
Hey, what's the matter? You owe them a lot of money?

461
00:28:03,498 --> 00:28:05,485
Come on, Mike, stay on my hip.

462
00:28:05,586 --> 00:28:06,586
Get them.

463
00:28:07,881 --> 00:28:09,206
Yeah baby.

464
00:28:09,704 --> 00:28:12,742
Don, look at the line 51. You'll see it cost maximum.

465
00:28:12,943 --> 00:28:14,245
I don't see 51.

466
00:28:14,446 --> 00:28:17,334
Don Vidrine and Bob Kaluza.

467
00:28:17,435 --> 00:28:20,163
- Welcome back Mr. Jimmy. - Yeah

468
00:28:20,195 --> 00:28:24,140
So we got all 500 cc cement poured down?

469
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:25,441
Yep.

470
00:28:25,642 --> 00:28:27,867
That cement only thing between us and the blowout.

471
00:28:28,068 --> 00:28:29,766
- And it's cued? - Yes.

472
00:28:29,967 --> 00:28:33,170
Had enough time huh? Face time doing it right.

473
00:28:33,378 --> 00:28:38,040
I mean that cement job is compromised then everything above it is too.

474
00:28:38,141 --> 00:28:40,636
It's not compromised you used to don't have a problem.

475
00:28:40,837 --> 00:28:43,429
So I assume Schlumberger guy said the same.

476
00:28:43,630 --> 00:28:46,176
Cement bond log they ran say the same huh?

477
00:28:46,377 --> 00:28:50,628
We are confident in the integrity of our cement job are we not?

478
00:28:50,830 --> 00:28:53,422
 We're quite comfortable with the integrity of that cement. That's true.

479
00:28:54,866 --> 00:28:57,487
Just like my grandad.

480
00:28:57,688 --> 00:28:58,688
Pardon.

481
00:28:58,791 --> 00:29:02,262
You see my granddaddy he never even went to the dentist.

482
00:29:02,363 --> 00:29:05,375
He didn't want to know what was wrong.
Cause then he will have to deal with it.

483
00:29:05,577 --> 00:29:08,403
You don't want to know that cement job ran as well as shit

484
00:29:08,604 --> 00:29:11,680
cause you're 43 days and 50 million dollars overbudget.

485
00:29:11,882 --> 00:29:14,161
You really shouldn't include yourself now Mr. Jimmy.

486
00:29:14,362 --> 00:29:18,763
BP picked this spot to drill, Bob.
Consequences that's on you guys.

487
00:29:18,964 --> 00:29:22,519
Of course I got to try and deal with those consequences.
So yeah I'm included the point is

488
00:29:22,620 --> 00:29:25,470
You sent the testing team home before they could do their job.

489
00:29:25,671 --> 00:29:28,000
Maybe give you all some news you all didn't want to hear.

490
00:29:28,202 --> 00:29:31,089
What would it cost you right now? The test?
125 grand?

491
00:29:32,182 --> 00:29:34,856
You're $180 billion dollar company you cheap

492
00:29:35,057 --> 00:29:40,031
That's why we're a $186 billion dollar company
We worry about those bills.

493
00:29:40,232 --> 00:29:41,734
I worry about my rig.

494
00:29:41,935 --> 00:29:44,608
My crew lives on it.
You just ran it.

495
00:29:44,709 --> 00:29:47,966
Don. You and I both know we need some downtime for maintenance.

496
00:29:48,149 --> 00:29:50,655
Mike, how many our machines need repair?

497
00:29:51,257 --> 00:29:53,482
390, Mr. Jimmy. - Three hundred and ninety? - Yes, sir.

498
00:29:53,683 --> 00:29:55,982
Almost all the same to those machinery board.

499
00:29:56,184 --> 00:29:58,357
Name a few for me. - A few?

500
00:29:58,959 --> 00:30:03,559
I would love to exactly what piece of mission critical equipment are down.

501
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:05,246
Shit where do I start?

502
00:30:05,447 --> 00:30:09,253
A driller chair, process station 18, BOP control part,

503
00:30:09,455 --> 00:30:13,195
telephone system, pipe rack system, GPS antenna, direct TV system, wireless internet,

504
00:30:13,397 --> 00:30:18,039
iron roughneck, top dryer barrack bag, system auxilliary
drivers control, saltwater service pump, smoke alarm in the galley

505
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:21,974
The reason why you're sweating so hard is because the compressor on the AC is down too.

506
00:30:23,661 --> 00:30:25,417
Everything but the toilet huh?

507
00:30:25,719 --> 00:30:28,781
No, no you got problem there too but I don't do shitters. That's engineering.

508
00:30:29,861 --> 00:30:31,025
Who are you?

509
00:30:32,217 --> 00:30:33,911
Mike Williams, Chief Electronic Technician.

510
00:30:34,012 --> 00:30:37,347
I'm going to tell you what I told your executives on the chopper ride in

511
00:30:37,449 --> 00:30:39,721
At the time...

512
00:30:39,922 --> 00:30:43,137
We're gonna properly secure this well for production platform

513
00:30:43,337 --> 00:30:46,605
coming right after us and start pumping oil.

514
00:30:46,706 --> 00:30:49,976
Unfortunately, to do it properly takes time.

515
00:30:50,077 --> 00:30:51,379
43 days?

516
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:53,198
44 days?

517
00:30:53,399 --> 00:30:54,399
Keep counting, Bob.

518
00:30:54,546 --> 00:30:55,547
45 days?

519
00:30:55,748 --> 00:30:57,026
46 days?

520
00:30:57,227 --> 00:30:58,696
Have a cookie, Bob.

521
00:30:59,893 --> 00:31:01,896
Can't run a cement log.

522
00:31:02,197 --> 00:31:04,063
I'll tell you what we going to do now.

523
00:31:04,364 --> 00:31:08,156
We going to run negative pressure test before we do anything else.

524
00:31:08,357 --> 00:31:09,857
Do you really think we really need to...

525
00:31:10,059 --> 00:31:12,470
I really think we need one Bob. So should you.

526
00:31:12,571 --> 00:31:16,902
Especially since we got no idea whether this well stable or not.

527
00:31:18,205 --> 00:31:20,832
Hey! Dial tone. Day is looking up.

528
00:31:21,634 --> 00:31:23,726
Mr. Anderson, it's Mr. Jimmy.

529
00:31:23,927 --> 00:31:28,165
We're going to run negative pressure test start tripping out 3,000 ft of pipe.

530
00:31:28,530 --> 00:31:29,530
Thank you.

531
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:33,861
Days behind schedule: 43 days.

532
00:31:43,676 --> 00:31:47,496
Young man. Pardon me. Can you please tell me where I can find Mr. Mike Williams?

533
00:31:47,697 --> 00:31:50,322
Yes, sir. He is in the ET shops on the second deck by the coffee shop.

534
00:31:50,423 --> 00:31:52,264
- Thank you very much. - Have a good one for the day, sir.

535
00:31:52,399 --> 00:31:53,566
And you sir.

536
00:31:57,414 --> 00:31:58,940
Mr. Williams?

537
00:32:00,603 --> 00:32:02,142
Mr. Vidrine, are you lost?

538
00:32:02,717 --> 00:32:03,852
Not at all.

539
00:32:04,153 --> 00:32:07,717
Just looking to come by and visit with you for a minute.

540
00:32:08,018 --> 00:32:09,434
How can I help?

541
00:32:09,635 --> 00:32:13,629
Seems as though you had something more you wanted to say in there.

542
00:32:13,830 --> 00:32:16,720
I thought I give you the time to say it.

543
00:32:21,851 --> 00:32:25,853
Okay. So this rig is broke?

544
00:32:25,967 --> 00:32:28,360
- I didnt' say that. - Sounds like you did.

545
00:32:29,463 --> 00:32:31,383
Is there a reason why you in my shop, Mr. Vidrine?

546
00:32:31,942 --> 00:32:35,030
We a big company Mike. BP.

547
00:32:35,231 --> 00:32:38,867
Very big complex organization.

548
00:32:39,068 --> 00:32:41,838
A lot of moving parts. Millions moving parts.

549
00:32:42,140 --> 00:32:44,719
Thousands upon thousands of people.

550
00:32:45,421 --> 00:32:49,507
And we all work very hard to ensure that all those people.

551
00:32:49,608 --> 00:32:54,093
All those movement parts are fuctioning properly as a mean to an ends.

552
00:32:54,194 --> 00:32:56,633
A very profitable win for all of us.

553
00:32:56,835 --> 00:32:58,502
They the big picture.

554
00:32:58,703 --> 00:33:03,473
They the little picture. Like you and the malfunctioned shitters.

555
00:33:03,674 --> 00:33:07,906
Don't you see point of fact they all kind of interconnected.

556
00:33:08,007 --> 00:33:10,133
They flow but working, Mike.

557
00:33:10,234 --> 00:33:12,101
So if you off, it's off.

558
00:33:12,304 --> 00:33:17,150
Then I'm off. Then we off. Then the whole damn train is off.

559
00:33:17,952 --> 00:33:20,004
You feel me, Mr. Williams?

560
00:33:20,106 --> 00:33:22,345
You on medication Mr. Vidrine?

561
00:33:23,047 --> 00:33:27,460
I'm merely trying to assess just how close this train

562
00:33:27,661 --> 00:33:29,639
is hugging the track.

563
00:33:31,169 --> 00:33:33,169
Okay I hear you.

564
00:33:33,431 --> 00:33:35,442
You want my take? I mean you really want my take.
- I do.

565
00:33:36,043 --> 00:33:39,913
I think you all trying to run out of fuel as the wheels touch down.

566
00:33:40,615 --> 00:33:43,659
Running on gasoline as the plane land is not smart.

567
00:33:43,860 --> 00:33:47,140
It's flawed thinking. It's hope as a tactic.

568
00:33:48,386 --> 00:33:52,448
Duly noted and much appreciated, sir.

569
00:33:52,683 --> 00:33:55,075
Just the opinion of little guy.

570
00:33:56,683 --> 00:33:58,372
That a catfish?

571
00:33:58,673 --> 00:34:01,177
Yeap. 65 pounds.

572
00:34:01,379 --> 00:34:03,575
What it all caught at? Nibbling?

573
00:34:03,777 --> 00:34:06,525
Noodling. We noodle for catfish.

574
00:34:06,927 --> 00:34:10,091
You know that's funny. Cause when we go noodling

575
00:34:10,192 --> 00:34:13,195
Your best way to fish is the lake. We walk down the boat ramp.

576
00:34:13,396 --> 00:34:16,742
We look for the biggest, darkest, blackest hole we can stick our arm in.

577
00:34:16,944 --> 00:34:19,927
We hope those big son of bitches bite down on us as hard as he can.

578
00:34:20,129 --> 00:34:21,737
So we can rip his ass out of that hole

579
00:34:21,938 --> 00:34:24,942
We want to get bit. That's the plan.

580
00:34:25,143 --> 00:34:27,298
Difference is we're ready for that bite.

581
00:34:27,599 --> 00:34:32,907
We are ready. I'm wearing shoes, hat,
gloves, golf cap, sunglasses and we are ready.

582
00:34:33,008 --> 00:34:36,902
I don't stick my hand with that monster and hope for the best.

583
00:34:37,075 --> 00:34:39,622
Uh huh. Hope ain't a tactic Don.

584
00:34:44,920 --> 00:34:46,301
I thank you for your time.

585
00:34:46,503 --> 00:34:48,749
- Have a wonderful day, sir. - And you.

586
00:34:50,052 --> 00:34:51,799
That some shit.

587
00:34:52,967 --> 00:34:55,183
Attention on the rig!

588
00:34:55,207 --> 00:34:57,694
Negative pressure test is about to begin.

589
00:34:57,895 --> 00:35:01,448
All non-essential personnel please stay clear of the rig platform.

590
00:35:02,050 --> 00:35:02,851
Bring it to the current.

591
00:35:03,052 --> 00:35:05,284
Come right two degrees lock in at 176.

592
00:35:05,485 --> 00:35:08,666
Turn right 10 degrees. Change to 176.

593
00:35:08,967 --> 00:35:09,967
Turning.

594
00:35:17,878 --> 00:35:21,108
- Damon B. Bankson ... - Is that your fifth cup?

595
00:35:23,256 --> 00:35:24,256
Just saying.

596
00:35:24,486 --> 00:35:26,998
Why don't you go ahead and make sure they ready to get after it.

597
00:35:27,199 --> 00:35:28,809
This might be the final test.

598
00:35:29,010 --> 00:35:30,088
Roger that.

599
00:35:30,589 --> 00:35:33,560
- Another negative pressure test? - Another negative pressure test.

600
00:35:33,761 --> 00:35:35,835
- Is there a problem? - We got a bad well.

601
00:35:36,036 --> 00:35:38,189
They all bad wells. Tough prospect.

602
00:35:38,390 --> 00:35:40,890
- Get this, Hollywood? - Have we entered?

603
00:35:43,716 --> 00:35:45,698
In position. Locked.

604
00:35:46,656 --> 00:35:49,985
- Locked at 176, Captain. - Came right 10 degrees.

605
00:35:50,186 --> 00:35:52,737
- We locked in you all can run the negative test. - Yeah.

606
00:35:53,532 --> 00:35:54,532
Hey, Jason.

607
00:35:54,654 --> 00:35:56,581
Lose the annular.

608
00:36:19,306 --> 00:36:21,657
Initiate negative pressure test.

609
00:36:22,058 --> 00:36:25,219
Initiate drill pipe pressure test.

610
00:36:48,205 --> 00:36:50,169
You really think this is the last test?

611
00:36:50,271 --> 00:36:54,422
Shit, I hope so, yes. This is the Well from Hell, girl.

612
00:37:19,764 --> 00:37:21,700
Yeah, that ain't going to last long.

613
00:37:23,022 --> 00:37:24,034
That's all you got.

614
00:37:25,753 --> 00:37:26,753
Goal!

615
00:37:37,070 --> 00:37:39,244
100 pounds per squre inch.

616
00:37:40,852 --> 00:37:45,855
Okay, pushing back on us a little. It's trying to keep us on it.

617
00:37:49,682 --> 00:37:53,950
Don, you get that bottle of wine that I sent you a month ago?

618
00:37:54,152 --> 00:37:57,713
I did I did thank you very much. Not only I got it, I drank me.

619
00:37:58,339 --> 00:37:59,885
- Pretty good huh? - Very nice.

620
00:37:59,986 --> 00:38:01,662
It's Super Tuscan, yeah?

621
00:38:02,064 --> 00:38:04,921
Gaya, right? I know you like it.

622
00:38:05,863 --> 00:38:06,863
Gaja.

623
00:38:07,464 --> 00:38:08,464
Sorry?

624
00:38:08,641 --> 00:38:11,111
Gaja. It's called.

625
00:38:20,219 --> 00:38:21,730
I think they're about halfway there.

626
00:38:21,998 --> 00:38:24,453
How much coffee you drinking these days, Hank?

627
00:38:24,654 --> 00:38:26,944
Look I gave it up several months ago.

628
00:38:27,145 --> 00:38:28,523
I drink nothing but green tea now.

629
00:38:28,724 --> 00:38:30,818
Stop taking the coffee doing yoga everyday.

630
00:38:32,495 --> 00:38:34,006
Two weeks now.

631
00:38:47,512 --> 00:38:49,567
450 psi.

632
00:38:55,224 --> 00:38:56,726
This don't look good to me.

633
00:39:02,216 --> 00:39:03,786
Pressure! Warning!

634
00:39:04,768 --> 00:39:05,835
900 psi.

635
00:39:11,944 --> 00:39:13,637
What the hell? Dammit.

636
00:39:20,622 --> 00:39:21,915
Pressure alert.

637
00:39:23,066 --> 00:39:24,546
1395 psi.

638
00:39:25,457 --> 00:39:26,929
Pressure alert.

639
00:39:28,873 --> 00:39:30,523
Pressure alert.

640
00:39:31,993 --> 00:39:33,213
Pressure alert.

641
00:39:34,887 --> 00:39:36,603
It only 1395 psi, Mr. Jimmy.

642
00:39:36,805 --> 00:39:38,521
That's a lot of pressure.

643
00:39:38,722 --> 00:39:41,329
Yeah. Enough to cut your car in half.

644
00:39:41,832 --> 00:39:43,232
Open up the annular unit.

645
00:39:43,420 --> 00:39:45,870
Hollywood, open the drill pipe valve.

646
00:39:46,071 --> 00:39:47,980
We got to free pressure.

647
00:39:49,484 --> 00:39:53,461
Gentlemen, I had to say this that is a bad test.

648
00:39:53,662 --> 00:39:54,764
Not necessarily.

649
00:39:54,965 --> 00:39:57,272
Don, a good test ...

650
00:39:57,473 --> 00:40:00,266
Starts zero. Stays at zero. Ends at zero.

651
00:40:00,467 --> 00:40:01,467
Thank you.

652
00:40:01,569 --> 00:40:06,236
So there is pressure but there was no mud.

653
00:40:06,438 --> 00:40:07,464
Flowing out of that pipe. Now explain that to me.

654
00:40:14,007 --> 00:40:16,037
That's a confusing result I give you that.

655
00:40:16,238 --> 00:40:19,496
Kaluza and I have talked about this drill pipe.

656
00:40:19,698 --> 00:40:21,777


657
00:40:21,979 --> 00:40:27,021
There's something off with it. He says it's a bladder effect.

658
00:40:27,222 --> 00:40:28,324
Bladder effect?

659
00:40:28,525 --> 00:40:32,319
Bladder effect. He said Jason would know what he's talking about.

660
00:40:32,520 --> 00:40:34,693
I say that flow right there.

661
00:40:34,794 --> 00:40:35,495
Right.

662
00:40:35,696 --> 00:40:36,497
Look at here.

663
00:40:36,701 --> 00:40:38,530
Hey! We actually needed that.

664
00:40:39,003 --> 00:40:41,162
Bladder effect.

665
00:40:41,363 --> 00:40:44,644
It is a pocket of pressure

666
00:40:45,969 --> 00:40:48,522
trapped around the annular

667
00:40:48,723 --> 00:40:51,401
which reeks like drill pressure

668
00:40:51,603 --> 00:40:56,062
because it is trapped right there

669
00:40:56,264 --> 00:40:57,715
sitting right there on the sensor.

670
00:40:57,916 --> 00:41:01,140
If this was a legitimate pressure issue

671
00:41:01,341 --> 00:41:06,855
the we would have mud flowing right back
up and out of that drill pipe right there.

672
00:41:07,157 --> 00:41:09,276
Now how we going to test this?

673
00:41:09,478 --> 00:41:12,746
We going to run that negative pressure test again.

674
00:41:12,847 --> 00:41:16,547
But we going to run it on the kill line. Not on the drill pipe.

675
00:41:16,748 --> 00:41:19,528
Obviously our problem is with that drill pipe.

676
00:41:19,668 --> 00:41:21,644
You cannot have

677
00:41:21,846 --> 00:41:26,472
13,095 pounds of pressure per square inch

678
00:41:26,708 --> 00:41:29,415
enough to cut your car in half.

679
00:41:29,616 --> 00:41:35,045
and not have any fluid being forced up
and out of that pipe by that pressure.

680
00:41:37,353 --> 00:41:41,592
Boys, do you have a whole mess of drilling mud on your boots out there?

681
00:41:41,593 --> 00:41:42,593
Hey, Don.

682
00:41:46,531 --> 00:41:48,099
It got hot in the drill shack.

683
00:41:48,401 --> 00:41:51,039
We have a problem with that drill pipe.

684
00:41:51,240 --> 00:41:55,395
or with the sensor giving us a false reading.

685
00:41:56,553 --> 00:42:01,161
Or any other of a thousands moving parts down there.

686
00:42:01,288 --> 00:42:03,645
Now, the way we going to find out

687
00:42:03,844 --> 00:42:07,533
is run that negative pressure test on the kill line.

688
00:42:07,734 --> 00:42:10,398
and if there is zero pressure Mr. Jimmy

689
00:42:10,563 --> 00:42:13,634
Then that is going to tell us all we need to know.

690
00:42:13,767 --> 00:42:15,587
Are we in agreement?

691
00:42:16,521 --> 00:42:18,982
I don't know about agreement. Never hurts to run a test.

692
00:42:19,183 --> 00:42:19,984
Look.

693
00:42:20,185 --> 00:42:22,305
How we doing here, Mr. Jimmy?

694
00:42:22,506 --> 00:42:25,026
We're doing great aren't we Don?

695
00:42:26,028 --> 00:42:27,129
Yes we are.

696
00:42:31,678 --> 00:42:33,284
BP's well.

697
00:42:37,691 --> 00:42:38,691
It is.

698
00:42:38,866 --> 00:42:41,148
- Bp's oil. - Indeed.

699
00:42:41,713 --> 00:42:44,842
We just to help you all hire a driller hole.

700
00:42:45,244 --> 00:42:47,224
You are correct, Mr. Jimmy.

701
00:42:47,425 --> 00:42:51,276
But we 50 days late. And the hole ain't drilling.

702
00:42:53,110 --> 00:42:56,015
Now Mr. Jimmy, we have issue in the galley.

703
00:42:56,748 --> 00:43:00,355
- A whole bunch of people. A safety issue. - It won't take but a minute.

704
00:43:11,027 --> 00:43:14,069
That's are 43 days, not 50. Simple mathematics.

705
00:43:14,212 --> 00:43:18,089
Where your completion date was March 8. It's 20th April today. 43 days.

706
00:43:18,290 --> 00:43:19,290
Yep.

707
00:43:19,393 --> 00:43:22,582
I thought you money greedy sons of bitch at least good at math.

708
00:43:22,883 --> 00:43:24,276
Allright, gentlemen.

709
00:43:24,677 --> 00:43:28,145
Oh hey, Dewey. Negative pressure test on the kill line.

710
00:43:28,346 --> 00:43:29,458
Switching to kill line test.

711
00:43:29,660 --> 00:43:32,184
Initiating kill line pressure test.

712
00:43:32,385 --> 00:43:33,385
Bladder effect.

713
00:43:34,630 --> 00:43:35,807
It ran true to you?

714
00:43:36,308 --> 00:43:40,930
Well that came out of Vildrine's mouth that rang true to me. Yeah.

715
00:43:41,232 --> 00:43:44,948
I mean on it's face, yeah.

716
00:43:45,250 --> 00:43:47,976
There's a logic to it. It's got merit. But

717
00:43:48,478 --> 00:43:51,713
I don't apply to kill pipes and kill lines

718
00:43:52,215 --> 00:43:55,159
- A little above my paygrade. - We should've seen some mud.

719
00:44:20,336 --> 00:44:21,780
Pressure alert.

720
00:44:22,381 --> 00:44:25,018
PRESSURE LINE OF CHOKING

721
00:44:39,526 --> 00:44:41,534
Yes! Good job!

722
00:44:41,835 --> 00:44:45,650
The Deepwater Horizon is receiving BP's highest safety award.

723
00:44:45,745 --> 00:44:47,247
for the seventh straight year.

724
00:44:47,364 --> 00:44:51,933
And it all starts at the top. The man you call Mr. Jimmy

725
00:44:55,688 --> 00:44:56,900
Mr. Jimmy, Mr. Jimmy.

726
00:44:57,001 --> 00:44:58,002
Speech.

727
00:45:16,587 --> 00:45:19,994
He held at zero, boss. Good test. No pressure.

728
00:45:20,296 --> 00:45:23,129
Congratulations, good test.

729
00:45:23,331 --> 00:45:27,143
We still got 14,000 psi on the drill line.

730
00:45:27,344 --> 00:45:30,285
Drill line and the kill line should be exactly the same.

731
00:45:30,473 --> 00:45:31,748
They should all be lined up.

732
00:45:31,848 --> 00:45:34,645
We already agreed to test something wrong with the drill line.

733
00:45:34,847 --> 00:45:36,243
Why do you keep coming back to it?

734
00:45:36,445 --> 00:45:38,023
I don't know. Good old field practice.

735
00:45:38,324 --> 00:45:42,329
No mud. No flow. We got to go.

736
00:45:43,231 --> 00:45:46,745
Now how quick can we lock the dough on this well?

737
00:45:47,347 --> 00:45:50,430
I'm not doing nothing until Mr. Jimmy is made aware.

738
00:45:52,458 --> 00:45:55,991
Is there a man in you? Is there an adult?

739
00:45:57,775 --> 00:46:03,279
The dip. The steel toes.

740
00:46:03,480 --> 00:46:04,900
But it's all bullshit.

741
00:46:05,202 --> 00:46:08,410
We got zero pressure on the kill line.

742
00:46:08,611 --> 00:46:10,859
You nervous as cat.

743
00:46:11,060 --> 00:46:14,339
Afraid to make it work at every turns.

744
00:46:14,541 --> 00:46:17,852
That will be my summary back to my bosses in London.

745
00:46:18,053 --> 00:46:19,054
Bob?

746
00:46:19,989 --> 00:46:21,446
Agreed.

747
00:46:23,082 --> 00:46:28,156
Again, you can call Mr. Jimmy.

748
00:46:29,223 --> 00:46:32,911
And I no longer keep you from your ice cream for another second. Thanks.

749
00:46:34,494 --> 00:46:37,305
- This Mr. Jimmy. - We ended the negative test.

750
00:46:37,506 --> 00:46:39,662
It was good test. We got no pressure.

751
00:46:40,610 --> 00:46:43,367
I'm about to start in this place. I want your blessing.

752
00:46:43,568 --> 00:46:44,769
You sure about this, Jason?

753
00:46:45,171 --> 00:46:49,179
Kill line was good. It was all nothing I'm sure.

754
00:46:50,568 --> 00:46:53,624
This guys are all over me. What you want to do?

755
00:46:54,939 --> 00:46:56,655
Zero flow, correct?

756
00:46:56,756 --> 00:46:58,238
It's correct. No flow.

757
00:47:10,250 --> 00:47:11,463
Are we good?

758
00:47:13,517 --> 00:47:15,691
Well, it's looks like it's going to be a long night.

759
00:47:16,880 --> 00:47:20,704
You stay on top of it, Jason. I see you on top about half an hour. Thanks.

760
00:47:24,817 --> 00:47:26,641
Okay, guys. Good test.

761
00:47:26,851 --> 00:47:27,682
Yahoo.

762
00:47:27,783 --> 00:47:30,129
Get ready to pull out 10,000 barrels of mud.

763
00:47:30,230 --> 00:47:34,111
I think I'm going to take a shower and wash my day off before I start my night.

764
00:47:34,312 --> 00:47:36,309
- It's gonna be long night. - Get some ice cream, Mike.

765
00:47:36,510 --> 00:47:37,770
I'm gonna watch my figure.

766
00:47:37,972 --> 00:47:41,062
I'll go fix up some smoke detectors before I'm about to pop somebody in the mouth.

767
00:47:41,263 --> 00:47:44,285
That's a good idea. Say hi to Felicia for me.

768
00:47:44,486 --> 00:47:45,287
- Mr. Jimmy? - Yes?

769
00:47:45,488 --> 00:47:46,790
We really need you in this.

770
00:47:46,918 --> 00:47:48,980
- Just a picture.

771
00:47:49,169 --> 00:47:50,070
Alright Mr. Jimmy.

772
00:47:50,171 --> 00:47:53,146
Hey appreciate it a lot guys.

773
00:47:57,564 --> 00:47:58,960
Did you take the picture?

774
00:48:04,794 --> 00:48:05,807
Help me check the house.

775
00:48:06,008 --> 00:48:06,715


776
00:48:06,916 --> 00:48:07,717
We got a good test.

777
00:48:07,918 --> 00:48:11,760
We start sending us some mud. Transfer them to Bankston.

778
00:48:11,861 --> 00:48:12,863
Copy that.

779
00:48:13,464 --> 00:48:15,884
Nervous as cat. Cat ain't scare.

780
00:48:16,086 --> 00:48:19,073
I had a cat named Oscar used to try to mount my Labrador.

781
00:48:19,374 --> 00:48:20,751
i'm opening the annular.

782
00:48:21,052 --> 00:48:23,184
Let's hope that monster ain't awake.

783
00:48:25,965 --> 00:48:27,308
Mud pumps are on.

784
00:48:27,710 --> 00:48:29,133
Removing heavy mud from well.

785
00:48:29,335 --> 00:48:32,184
Displacement Holding in Tank 2.

786
00:48:32,386 --> 00:48:33,536
4%

787
00:48:33,737 --> 00:48:35,344
Boys we got a good test.

788
00:48:35,446 --> 00:48:37,774
Let's pump out all these mud.

789
00:48:44,646 --> 00:48:46,737
We're done.

790
00:48:46,838 --> 00:48:51,377
We're going home. - Bring in the mud. Bring in the mud.

791
00:48:51,578 --> 00:48:53,713
Damon Bankston at Deepwater Horizon.

792
00:48:53,832 --> 00:48:56,356
You are clear to approach and receive drilling mud.

793
00:48:56,558 --> 00:48:59,323
Copy Deepwater. Coming along side to receive heavy mud.

794
00:48:59,424 --> 00:49:02,168
All normal.

795
00:49:04,734 --> 00:49:07,704
Master deck, prepare prepare to receive the mud.

796
00:49:07,905 --> 00:49:09,803
10,000 barrels.

797
00:49:11,469 --> 00:49:14,011
Attention on the rig. Pressure test was good.

798
00:49:14,213 --> 00:49:16,842
Congratulations crew. We about to moving on.

799
00:49:17,043 --> 00:49:18,575
Well from Hell is done, boys.

800
00:49:18,876 --> 00:49:22,342
Oh man. The basin soon.

801
00:49:22,443 --> 00:49:24,457
Two or three days maybe. I'll be in my boat.

802
00:49:24,510 --> 00:49:27,184
Drinking me a beer. Catching us a sucker at the lake.

803
00:49:27,485 --> 00:49:30,691
Yes! You big beautiful mud.

804
00:49:30,792 --> 00:49:32,600
35%.

805
00:49:32,801 --> 00:49:34,893
- Hang on, baby. - We are going home!

806
00:49:34,994 --> 00:49:35,795


807
00:49:35,996 --> 00:49:37,868
I thought you had plans. I thought you going out.

808
00:49:38,068 --> 00:49:39,169
Cancelled.

809
00:49:40,380 --> 00:49:42,689
Sweatpants, bottle of beer and DVR.

810
00:49:42,890 --> 00:49:43,892
My favorite plan.

811
00:49:45,235 --> 00:49:47,275
Just simple country girl.

812
00:49:59,869 --> 00:50:01,197
55%

813
00:50:06,578 --> 00:50:08,648
75%

814
00:50:09,403 --> 00:50:12,127
- Do the same in the next. - Hopefully with fewer problems.

815
00:50:12,356 --> 00:50:16,609
Jason! I got a 20 barrels increased in flow.

816
00:50:16,810 --> 00:50:19,016
- Not slowing down. - Alright, stop pumping mud.

817
00:50:19,217 --> 00:50:20,585
- Pressure alert. - Oh no.

818
00:50:23,016 --> 00:50:25,740
- Standy. - They're shutting down.

819
00:50:25,942 --> 00:50:27,942
They must not be liking something up there.

820
00:50:28,812 --> 00:50:30,982
Hey, boys. I'm going to take a leak. You guys good?

821
00:50:31,082 --> 00:50:32,835
- I got you buddy. - All right.

822
00:50:36,855 --> 00:50:39,034
- Pressure alert. - It's not stopping.

823
00:50:39,236 --> 00:50:42,054
Clear the drill shack. Get him and him out of here.

824
00:50:42,256 --> 00:50:42,956
What is happening Jim?

825
00:50:43,158 --> 00:50:46,441
Jim what is the excitement. We stipulated there aint something wrong.

826
00:50:46,542 --> 00:50:49,877
I never should've let you push me. Now get your ass out of here before I push back.

827
00:50:50,079 --> 00:50:52,425
That comment will be noted.

828
00:50:52,726 --> 00:50:53,919
I'm ready to go home.

829
00:50:54,121 --> 00:50:56,646
Drinking beer and eating a steak.

830
00:51:00,259 --> 00:51:01,655
What's going on?

831
00:51:01,757 --> 00:51:03,905
Probably nothing, Mr. Kaluza.

832
00:51:04,543 --> 00:51:06,119
- Watch your step over here. - Shit.

833
00:51:07,822 --> 00:51:09,097
What you got, Caleb?

834
00:51:12,561 --> 00:51:13,865
What is it you do?

835
00:51:20,181 --> 00:51:21,297
Shit.

836
00:51:30,753 --> 00:51:32,036
Dammit.

837
00:51:32,138 --> 00:51:33,890
- What the hell's going on? - We got flow.

838
00:51:34,291 --> 00:51:36,178
Shit! That ain't good.

839
00:51:36,479 --> 00:51:37,793
Jason, you seeing this?

840
00:51:38,070 --> 00:51:39,272
We got flow out here.

841
00:51:39,573 --> 00:51:41,162
- Warning. - It's not stopping.

842
00:51:41,363 --> 00:51:43,356
Jason, are you seeing this?

843
00:51:43,557 --> 00:51:44,857
You got mud on the rig.

844
00:51:45,058 --> 00:51:46,644
Didn't I tell you not to do anything.

845
00:51:46,645 --> 00:51:48,114
Is she just kicking or just

846
00:51:51,461 --> 00:51:53,251
Clear the floor.

847
00:51:55,135 --> 00:51:56,672
Oh shit.

848
00:52:06,675 --> 00:52:08,806
Mike, what is that? Is everything okay?

849
00:52:11,894 --> 00:52:13,272
i'm closing the annular.

850
00:52:16,737 --> 00:52:18,274
Duck, get in here now.

851
00:52:18,475 --> 00:52:19,475
Are you shutting it in?

852
00:52:19,578 --> 00:52:22,720
Alright we're okay. I closed the annular. We got 30 seconds.

853
00:52:25,916 --> 00:52:27,429
Evacuate the floor, now!

854
00:52:27,830 --> 00:52:29,308
- Duck, are you okay? - Yes.

855
00:52:29,609 --> 00:52:32,079
Get the signal on the EDS. Get ready to cut that pipe.

856
00:52:32,280 --> 00:52:33,666
On your way.

857
00:52:35,484 --> 00:52:36,780
Adam!

858
00:52:37,081 --> 00:52:38,081
Shane!

859
00:52:40,009 --> 00:52:41,437
What do we do?

860
00:52:41,638 --> 00:52:43,063
- Caleb! - What do we do?

861
00:52:43,164 --> 00:52:45,354
Release the drill pipe pressure!

862
00:52:54,736 --> 00:52:56,212
Here here.

863
00:52:56,413 --> 00:53:00,523
i'm doing my best to accomodate it. But look...

864
00:53:05,834 --> 00:53:06,834


865
00:53:20,330 --> 00:53:24,610
Okay. Okay. We're alright. We're alright.

866
00:53:25,112 --> 00:53:27,929
- Caleb, how are we doing buddy? - Did we cut the pipe?

867
00:53:28,131 --> 00:53:30,636
We're good. Annular took care of it.

868
00:53:30,904 --> 00:53:32,464
It's just a kick.

869
00:53:32,665 --> 00:53:34,949
It's the biggest damn kick I've ever seen.

870
00:53:35,820 --> 00:53:38,546
She put a whoop ass on Maggie and her penguin.

871
00:53:38,747 --> 00:53:39,749
Get out of here.

872
00:53:39,750 --> 00:53:40,750
She did.

873
00:53:40,852 --> 00:53:42,710
And she did it all without this?

874
00:53:43,581 --> 00:53:44,428
No!

875
00:53:44,529 --> 00:53:47,063
That is a genuine dinosaur tooth.

876
00:54:31,364 --> 00:54:33,589
Gas alarm in the mud pits. Again.

877
00:54:33,790 --> 00:54:36,877
Same one goes off everytime . Off all down.

878
00:54:37,178 --> 00:54:38,627


879
00:54:40,493 --> 00:54:41,493
Hey, Roy!

880
00:54:41,568 --> 00:54:43,285
I got it. You got to get out of here.

881
00:54:43,887 --> 00:54:45,485
Too late.

882
00:54:50,266 --> 00:54:51,372
Pressure. Warning.

883
00:54:52,194 --> 00:54:53,852
Pressure. Warning.

884
00:54:53,953 --> 00:54:55,512
Shit. Jason!

885
00:54:55,713 --> 00:54:56,810
Oh shit!

886
00:54:57,311 --> 00:54:59,095
Caleb, get out of that mud.

887
00:55:14,118 --> 00:55:15,569
The BOP ain't working.

888
00:55:15,670 --> 00:55:18,964
Holy shit. Duck, close the second annular.

889
00:55:19,065 --> 00:55:20,065
Annular failure.

890
00:55:22,041 --> 00:55:24,740
Adam! Shane! They Get down to the mud room now.

891
00:55:24,842 --> 00:55:25,842
Adam!

892
00:55:26,677 --> 00:55:28,198
We got to go buddy.

893
00:55:28,399 --> 00:55:29,601
We gotta get to the mud room.

894
00:55:29,802 --> 00:55:32,731
We must get to the mud room! Caleb!

895
00:55:33,433 --> 00:55:36,433
- Caleb! - Get off the floor! Get off the floor!

896
00:55:40,533 --> 00:55:42,520
It's the Pump 2. Bleed it. Bleed it.

897
00:55:42,722 --> 00:55:43,902


898
00:56:01,008 --> 00:56:04,009
Caleb, close the drill pipe behind them.

899
00:56:04,210 --> 00:56:05,811
They blow everything overboard.

900
00:56:08,158 --> 00:56:09,372
Jason, what do we do?

901
00:56:30,725 --> 00:56:32,284
- Failure. - We got debris!

902
00:56:32,485 --> 00:56:33,565
- OMG! - Dammit!

903
00:56:33,734 --> 00:56:35,514
Caleb, clear the floor.

904
00:56:41,424 --> 00:56:42,578
You're alright?

905
00:56:42,680 --> 00:56:45,086
The alarm didn't go off. I'm going to make sure everyone evacuates.

906
00:56:45,287 --> 00:56:47,443
- Get to the lifeboats. Go! - Ok.

907
00:56:51,741 --> 00:56:52,786
Halt. Stop.

908
00:57:06,400 --> 00:57:07,646
Look out. Look out.

909
00:57:13,285 --> 00:57:14,285
What the hell.

910
00:57:15,130 --> 00:57:16,156
Dammit!

911
00:57:22,759 --> 00:57:23,762
Jesus.

912
00:57:25,070 --> 00:57:27,375
Deepwater Horizon, this is David Bankston. Copy?

913
00:57:30,124 --> 00:57:31,990
The BOP is not responding.

914
00:57:34,197 --> 00:57:35,836
- Duck. Get that button right now. - Okay.

915
00:57:37,031 --> 00:57:38,031
Right now!

916
00:57:39,606 --> 00:57:40,891
Caution. Gas.

917
00:57:40,992 --> 00:57:42,980
Duck! Duck!

918
00:57:43,081 --> 00:57:44,081
What happened?

919
00:57:45,645 --> 00:57:46,689
Keith!

920
00:57:47,310 --> 00:57:48,310
Gordie!

921
00:57:48,389 --> 00:57:49,662
Come on! Get up!

922
00:57:49,863 --> 00:57:51,370
Roy! You gotta go.

923
00:57:51,936 --> 00:57:55,073
We gotta go right now.

924
00:58:24,571 --> 00:58:25,895
Alert gas.

925
00:58:26,096 --> 00:58:27,850
Shit. The gas alarm.

926
00:58:40,819 --> 00:58:42,499
The thrusters are over-revving.

927
00:58:45,386 --> 00:58:47,285
I thruster is running away from me.

928
00:58:47,486 --> 00:58:50,396
- I'm not going to be able to hold the rig in place. - Calm down.

929
00:58:51,836 --> 00:58:53,298
OMG.

930
00:58:55,601 --> 00:58:58,972
Is it just me or does it get all bright in there all of the sudden?

931
00:59:06,646 --> 00:59:09,329
Magenta. Magenta alarm.

932
00:59:14,472 --> 00:59:16,056
- The well is blowing out. - What?

933
00:59:18,292 --> 00:59:19,292
Mike.

934
00:59:19,584 --> 00:59:21,816
Mayday! This is Deepwater Horizon. We're...

935
00:59:23,223 --> 00:59:25,496
What the hell are you doing? Did I asked you to call a Mayday!

936
00:59:27,908 --> 00:59:30,207
I call you back! I call you back!

937
00:59:33,208 --> 00:59:35,065
You don't know the difference between a kick and a goddamn blowout!

938
00:59:35,548 --> 00:59:38,362
- Why is ? - You don't know shit! Why is the monitor out?

939
00:59:38,563 --> 00:59:39,964
Gas.

940
00:59:41,087 --> 00:59:43,875
Mayday! Mayday! Mayday!
This is Deepwater Horizon.

941
00:59:51,806 --> 00:59:54,339
Come on, Duck. I'm going to get you out.

942
01:00:24,408 --> 01:00:27,366
Goddammit! Dewey! Steve!

943
01:00:39,950 --> 01:00:41,496
- No! - Jesus!

944
01:00:47,465 --> 01:00:49,564
Mayday! Mayday!
This is Deepwater Horizon.

945
01:00:49,765 --> 01:00:52,528
- The rig is on fire. - We got a major explosion. We need assistance.

946
01:00:52,729 --> 01:00:55,888
- Don't you see it's on fire? - I repeat we have mass casualty explosion.

947
01:00:56,089 --> 01:00:57,469
We need assistance immediately.

948
01:00:57,771 --> 01:00:59,286
Mayday! Mayday! Mayday!

949
01:00:59,487 --> 01:01:02,142
May Day! May Day! May Day! This is Damon Bankston.

950
01:01:02,544 --> 01:01:05,664
The Deepwater Horizon has exploded and is on fire.

951
01:01:05,665 --> 01:01:09,649
I say again, Deepwater Horizon has exploded and is on fire.

952
01:01:09,851 --> 01:01:11,153
We saw a huge explosion.

953
01:01:11,353 --> 01:01:13,397
Yes, the Deepwater Horizon is on fire.

954
01:01:13,598 --> 01:01:16,102
- Is everyone off the rig? - We have no idea.

955
01:01:16,574 --> 01:01:19,039


956
01:01:20,853 --> 01:01:24,168
United States Coast Guard. This is State Command Center and Von Huene speaking.

957
01:01:29,124 --> 01:01:34,029
Okay an oil rig on fire. About 48 nautical miles south of Venice.

958
01:01:35,716 --> 01:01:39,538
Okay, yes sir. What vessel are you on? What's the name of your vessel?

959
01:01:40,805 --> 01:01:43,671

If you get into an oil anything swim away from the rig.

1053
01:09:21,502 --> 01:09:24,182
Should we wait for the coastguard?

1065
01:09:47,908 --> 01:09:49,533

1075
01:10:41,146 --> 01:10:42,193


1076
01:10:42,395 --> 01:10:44,340
Someone there? This is Caleb. I need help in here.

1077
01:10:44,441 --> 01:10:45,441
It's Wyman!

1078
01:10:45,503 --> 01:10:48,041
We gotta get out of here. There's methane everywhere.

1079
01:10:48,442 --> 01:10:51,150
I found him like this. He hurt real bad now. He ain't getting up.

1080
01:10:51,351 --> 01:10:53,229
- Don't look down alright? - No no.

1081
01:10:56,031 --> 01:10:58,726
Wait! Shit, His bone caught on the metal.

1082
01:11:00,628 --> 01:11:01,911


1083
01:11:09,412 --> 01:11:10,412

01:11:16,467 --> 01:11:18,465
Pull! Pull!

1087
01:11:18,666 --> 01:11:20,256
Keep pulling!

1088
01:11:26,417 --> 01:11:27,881
I lost power.

1089
01:11:28,082 --> 01:11:30,571
Stop. Just stop a second. Let me think.

1090
01:11:40,516 --> 01:11:41,680
I want to cut the pipe.

1091
01:11:43,505 --> 01:11:45,950
Hey, Andrea, get your ass back on station.

1092
01:11:46,452 --> 01:11:47,720
We don't have the authority.

1093
01:11:47,921 --> 01:11:49,022
I'm going to seal the well.

1094
01:11:49,223 --> 01:11:50,711
Do not touch that button!

1095
01:11:52,349 --> 01:11:54,078
We need to take the EDS.

1096
01:11:54,279 --> 01:11:55,675
We don't have the authority.

1097
01:11:58,485 --> 01:11:59,993
You ain't pushing it.

1098
01:12:00,695 --> 01:12:03,603
Can somebody help me?

1099
01:12:03,805 --> 01:12:05,438
Go! Get out of here.

1100
01:12:05,639 --> 01:12:07,570
You're coming with or without that leg.

1101
01:12:07,671 --> 01:12:08,958
Hold on. Hold on.

1102
01:12:09,159 --> 01:12:09,860
Hey, look at me.

1103
01:12:10,061 --> 01:12:12,742
This gonna hurt like a bitch. You stay calm for a second, okay.

1104
01:12:12,942 --> 01:12:14,668
Look at me. Don't look down, look at me.

01:12:16,558 --> 01:12:17,558
Hold on.

1107
01:12:18,734 --> 01:12:20,629
Pull. Pull.

1108
01:12:20,931 --> 01:12:22,361
Wyman, can you move?

1109
01:12:22,462 --> 01:12:23,464
Let's go.

1110
01:12:24,917 --> 01:12:26,860
Okay, take me to the bridge, Mike.

1111
01:12:36,272 --> 01:12:37,872
Coast Guard. This is Command Center. Lieutenant Degan speaking.

1112
01:12:37,979 --> 01:12:39,239
Hi, sir.

1113

Huh, I just huh. I don't mean to bother you. I'm sure everything are just fine.

Yes, ma'am. Right now we only have a couple of confirmed reports
with a fire on an oil rig. That's all I can say.

1116
01:12:54,898 --> 01:12:57,551
They're on the Deepwater Horizon?

1117
01:12:57,852 --> 01:13:00,154
Because there's so many rigs out there. You sure?

1118
01:13:00,273 --> 01:13:02,392
Yes, there is a fire on the Deepwater Horizon.

1119
01:13:02,593 --> 01:13:05,056
That's all I can say to you, Ma'am. Sorry. I really have to go.

1120
01:14:03,892 --> 01:14:05,106
What happened?

1121
01:14:14,058 --> 01:14:16,502
- Ken, you alright? - The derrick is gonna fall on us!

1122
01:14:19,140 --> 01:14:21,032
Damn, the boat slipped.

1123
01:14:21,209 --> 01:14:23,267
My crane is gonna take the goddamn derrick out.

1124
01:14:23,368 --> 01:14:25,217
- It's coming down! - Get on the boat now!

1125
01:14:25,318 --> 01:14:27,615
I must stop it, or it's gonna kill us all.

1126
01:14:44,539 --> 01:14:45,759
Go, Dale!

1127
01:14:49,097 --> 01:14:50,635
Go! Go! Go!

1128
01:14:51,336 --> 01:14:53,809
Help him up the stairs.

1129
01:14:55,347 --> 01:14:56,587
Shit!

1130
01:15:15,227 --> 01:15:16,597
Go Dale!

1131
01:15:29,984 --> 01:15:30,986

01:15:31,388 --> 01:15:33,929
Get out of there! Now!

1133
01:15:54,039 --> 01:15:55,334
Oh my God.

1134
01:16:12,199 --> 01:16:14,091
- Who's on the bridge? - Fleytas.

1135
01:16:14,292 --> 01:16:15,292
Kuchta.

1136
01:16:16,354 --> 01:16:18,476


1137
01:16:23,544 --> 01:16:26,063


1138
01:16:28,251 --> 01:16:30,582
Get your ass on the lifeboat.

1139
01:16:36,656 --> 01:16:40,516
Andrea, Kuchta, did disconnected it?

1140
01:16:40,717 --> 01:16:41,717
No.

1141
01:16:41,819 --> 01:16:44,559
Andrea, get my hands on the EDS.

1142
01:16:44,760 --> 01:16:47,331
I'm gonna cut the pipe and seal this well.

1143
01:16:47,532 --> 01:16:49,039
We gonna choke this fire.

1144
01:16:49,240 --> 01:16:51,071
- Right here. - No, no, up, up!

1145
01:16:52,238 --> 01:16:53,238


1146
01:17:02,163 --> 01:17:03,603
Still burning?

1147
01:17:03,804 --> 01:17:07,935
- It still flow, Mr. Jimmy. - Oh come on. Please! Please!

1148
01:17:14,414 --> 01:17:16,299
It still burning Mr. Jimmy. We gotta go.

1149
01:17:16,501 --> 01:17:19,142


1150
01:17:19,442 --> 01:17:21,494
Hey! Hey! Couple more.

1151
01:17:23,113 --> 01:17:24,113
Get in!

1152
01:17:27,665 --> 01:17:29,693
We need to restore power.

1153
01:17:29,905 --> 01:17:33,448
- We need to press the standby generator online. - The fire fighting pump?

1154
01:17:33,649 --> 01:17:37,495
No, we just want to keep this rig on station as long as we can. So that pipe doesn't break.

1155
01:17:37,596 --> 01:17:41,045
- That's all we can do. We can't save this rig. -  It can't hurt to go try.

1156
01:17:41,246 --> 01:17:44,326
Thank you very much Mike. It's on the other side of that derrick.

1157
01:17:44,527 --> 01:17:45,228
I know. I know.

1158
01:17:45,329 --> 01:17:46,630
- I'm coming with you. - What?

1159
01:17:46,731 --> 01:17:48,068
- I'm with you. - You sure?

1160
01:17:48,169 --> 01:17:49,752
- I'm with you. - Go on, Mike.

1161
01:17:49,954 --> 01:17:50,954
Come on.

1162
01:17:55,780 --> 01:18:00,778


1163
01:18:00,979 --> 01:18:04,042


1164
01:18:04,243 --> 01:18:05,243


1165
01:18:05,244 --> 01:18:08,104


1166
01:18:08,304 --> 01:18:11,045
Natalie, this is Felicia Williams.

1167
01:18:11,246 --> 01:18:13,776
Our husbands work on the Deepwater Horizon together.

1168
01:18:13,976 --> 01:18:17,015
I just called the Coast Guard and they can just confirmed that there is a fire ...

1169
01:18:17,216 --> 01:18:19,507

1170
01:18:19,709 --> 01:18:21,111
What the Coast Guard said?

1171
01:18:21,411 --> 01:18:23,039
Just that there has been a fire.

1172
01:18:23,840 --> 01:18:26,691
Shelly heard there's people jumping off the rig.

1173
01:18:32,676 --> 01:18:33,763
What are you doing?

1174
01:18:35,834 --> 01:18:36,979
Not now, babe.

1180
01:19:02,576 --> 01:19:03,850
- Lower the boat! - Go!

1181
01:19:15,404 --> 01:19:16,637


1182
01:19:16,839 --> 01:19:20,603


1183
01:19:26,076 --> 01:19:28,397

Mike? Bring the power.

1190
01:19:50,627 --> 01:19:51,628
You know your way around this thing?

1191
01:19:51,729 --> 01:19:53,232
How hard can it be?

1192
01:19:53,433 --> 01:19:54,983
Come here. Read this shit off to me.

1193
01:19:55,974 --> 01:19:57,240
You gotta be shitting me.

1195
01:20:00,222 --> 01:20:02,371
"Switching power switch."

You know I had a full ride to UT architecture school.

1201
01:20:13,550 --> 01:20:15,550
- What the hell you doing here?

You should've.

1203
01:20:16,758 --> 01:20:19,335
- Mr. Jimmy, you get any power up there? - This should be it

1204
01:20:21,291 --> 01:20:22,037
Do you have the power?

1205
01:20:22,138 --> 01:20:24,310
- We still outside the walk circle?
- Yes. For outstation.

1206

01:20:26,592 --> 01:20:27,592
Bring us back slow.

1208
01:20:31,453 --> 01:20:32,536
Come on, baby! Come one!

There you go.

1218
01:21:00,969 --> 01:21:03,503
Mr. Jimmy, did you get power up there?

1219
01:21:03,704 --> 01:21:06,607
- We have power, Mike. - Please. No no.

1220
01:21:07,611 --> 01:21:09,206
Kuchta, can you help me?

1225
01:21:38,250 --> 01:21:39,424
Look out!

1226
01:21:41,415 --> 01:21:43,075
It's all coming down.

1227
01:21:43,264 --> 01:21:45,040
We gotta get to the boat.

1228
01:21:47,018 --> 01:21:48,565
- Come on lower the boat. - Shut the door

1229
01:21:51,916 --> 01:21:53,111
Let's go!

1230
01:22:05,186 --> 01:22:06,445

01:22:32,448 --> 01:22:35,025
Open it up!

01:22:35,902 --> 01:22:37,698
Open the shaft.

1238
01:22:37,799 --> 01:22:39,600
Shit come one! Hold the flag!

1239

Tie it up! Tie it up!

1245
01:22:54,700 --> 01:22:55,898
Shit!

No, wait! Wait!

1253
01:23:35,490 --> 01:23:38,008
There is too much fire. We can't jump from here.

1254
01:23:39,494 --> 01:23:40,933
We need to get up higher.

1255
01:23:41,710 --> 01:23:43,361
We need to get up higher. Come on.

1256
01:23:48,199 --> 01:23:49,322
Slow down. Slow down.

1257
01:23:49,924 --> 01:23:51,497
It's a raft!

1258
01:23:51,598 --> 01:23:52,598
Hang on.

1259
01:23:57,263 --> 01:23:58,263

Your Mustang. Original V8 or crate motor?

1271
01:25:12,085 --> 01:25:13,357
It's original.

1272
01:25:13,999 --> 01:25:17,401
It's cool. We might need to rebuild that.

1273
01:25:17,603 --> 01:25:19,204
Who's we?

1274
01:25:19,906 --> 01:25:21,583
Do you see anyone else here?

1275
01:25:22,726 --> 01:25:23,959
Me and you.

1276
01:25:26,210 --> 01:25:27,837
Listen to me. Look at me!

1277
01:25:28,426 --> 01:25:31,154
We up higher we can jump up farther.

1278
01:25:31,356 --> 01:25:33,522
Okay? We gonna jump over the fire.

1279
01:25:33,623 --> 01:25:35,025
No no.

1280

I can't.

1281
01:25:39,644 --> 01:25:41,551
Can't what? Rebuild an engine?

1282
01:25:41,966 --> 01:25:43,201
Jump.

1283
01:25:44,095 --> 01:25:46,934
Trust me we not gonna hit the fire. You hear me?

1284
01:25:47,135 --> 01:25:49,513
- I'm don't wanna die. - We are not gonna die. - I don't wanna die.

1285
01:25:49,615 --> 01:25:50,815
Our choice right now.

1286
01:25:50,917 --> 01:25:53,490
is to burn or jump!

1287
01:25:53,692 --> 01:25:54,692
Will you let go off me.

1288
01:25:54,779 --> 01:25:57,794
Don't touch me. Don't touch me.

1289
01:25:57,995 --> 01:25:59,149
You jump.

1290
01:25:59,250 --> 01:26:00,250
Do what you want.

1291
01:26:00,452 --> 01:26:02,420
You know what? I'm gonna do whatever you do.

1292
01:26:05,250 --> 01:26:06,250
No.

1293
01:26:06,675 --> 01:26:09,800
- My wife is Felicia. My daughter, Sydney. - Don't put that on me.

1294
01:26:10,002 --> 01:26:11,939
And I will see them again. Do you understand me?

1295
01:26:13,186 --> 01:26:16,712
What are the odds of you getting out of this alive if you don't jump with me right now?

1296
01:26:17,313 --> 01:26:19,654
We're getting off this rig. Do you hear me?

1297
01:26:20,055 --> 01:26:22,593
You want to stay here? You stay here.

1298
01:26:28,532 --> 01:26:30,353
Hey, what color is the Mustang?

1299
01:26:30,454 --> 01:26:31,454


1300
01:27:11,752 --> 01:27:14,168
Andrea! Andrea!

1301
01:28:11,904 --> 01:28:14,552
If you hear your name, holler out.

1302
01:28:15,696 --> 01:28:17,307
Albers, Shane!

1303
01:28:17,408 --> 01:28:18,408
Here.

1304
01:28:19,575 --> 01:28:21,369
Holloway, Caleb!

1305
01:28:22,052 --> 01:28:23,052
Here.

1306
01:28:26,309 --> 01:28:28,396
Anderson, Jason!

1307
01:28:31,072 --> 01:28:33,832
Jason Anderson, are you here?

1308
01:28:37,324 --> 01:28:40,079
Is there anybody here from the drill shack?

1309
01:28:44,370 --> 01:28:45,437
Nobody?

1310
01:29:00,927 --> 01:29:03,098
Donald Clark, are you here?

1311
01:29:07,347 --> 01:29:08,671
Dewey Revette?

1312
01:29:12,762 --> 01:29:14,275
Shane Roshto?

1313
01:29:16,177 --> 01:29:17,794
Adam West?

1314
01:29:23,331 --> 01:29:24,580
Roy Kemp?

1315
01:29:27,343 --> 01:29:28,906
There is a doctor above.

1316
01:29:30,286 --> 01:29:31,952
Dale Burkeen?

1317
01:29:37,028 --> 01:29:38,442
Gordon Jones?

1318
01:29:42,469 --> 01:29:43,956
Karl Inger Klepp?

1319
01:29:51,741 --> 01:29:52,976
Stephen Curtis?

1320
01:30:05,152 --> 01:30:06,462
Keith manuel.

1321
01:30:06,763 --> 01:30:07,763
Thank you.

1322
01:30:12,660 --> 01:30:13,789
You're good?

1323
01:30:59,036 --> 01:31:00,567
All knees.

1324
01:31:02,237 --> 01:31:04,857
Our Father who art in Heaven.

1325
01:31:04,959 --> 01:31:08,303
Hallowed be thy name. Let thy kingdom come.

1326
01:31:08,505 --> 01:31:11,343
Thy will be done on Earth as it is in Heaven.

1327
01:31:11,544 --> 01:31:14,139
Give us today our daily bread.

1328
01:31:14,340 --> 01:31:19,158
Forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us.

1329
01:31:19,360 --> 01:31:23,085
Lead us not into temptation but deliver us from evil.

1330
01:31:50,670 --> 01:31:51,710
What is your name, sir?

1331
01:31:52,620 --> 01:31:53,803
Mike Williams.

1332
01:32:00,059 --> 01:32:03,649
You need to take some rest and after you done you talk to me.

1333
01:32:03,850 --> 01:32:05,794
Hey! Hey! You on the rig?

1334
01:32:05,995 --> 01:32:08,356
- Yes sir. - My son did he get off the rig with you?

1335
01:32:08,556 --> 01:32:10,008
- Rig? - Did he get off the rig?

1336
01:32:10,587 --> 01:32:11,739
I don't know if he made it.

1337
01:32:11,940 --> 01:32:12,975
Where is my son?

1338
01:32:13,476 --> 01:32:15,328
Where is my son?

1339
01:32:15,529 --> 01:32:17,203
- Did he get off the rig? - I don't know.

1340
01:32:22,556 --> 01:32:24,496
My son. Do you know him?

1341
01:32:24,597 --> 01:32:26,062
Did he leave with you?

1342
01:32:26,263 --> 01:32:28,525
Somebody better tell me something.

1343
01:32:32,147 --> 01:32:34,741
Somebody help me.

1344
01:32:38,546 --> 01:32:40,070


1345
01:32:40,784 --> 01:32:42,952
Did you hear any of the alarms?

1346
01:33:12,949 --> 01:33:14,722
Dad.

1347
01:35:20,425 --> 01:35:23,031
Mike Williams never returned to the sea. He lives with his family in Texas.

1348
01:35:23,032 --> 01:35:26,319
I remember I closed my eyes and saying a prayer. Asking God ...

1349
01:35:26,420 --> 01:35:30,971
to tell my wife and my little girl that daddy did everything he could.

1350
01:35:31,172 --> 01:35:33,611
And if I survive this, it's for a reason.

1351
01:35:40,924 --> 01:35:42,192
Please raise your right hand.

1352
01:35:42,394 --> 01:35:46,082
Do you solemnly swear that the testimony you about to give is the truth.

1353
01:35:46,283 --> 01:35:48,309
The whole truth and nothing but the truth. So help you God.

1354
01:35:48,511 --> 01:35:49,712
- Yes sir. - Thank you, sir.

1355
01:35:56,544 --> 01:36:00,769
We went to the next light that we saw in the water and retrieve that person.

1356
01:36:00,970 --> 01:36:04,115
It was Andrea, dynamic position operator.

1357
01:36:07,845 --> 01:36:12,078
Andrea Fleytas lives in California. She no longer works in the oil industry

1358
01:36:12,280 --> 01:36:16,900
I went to the PA made the last announcement and said that we were abandoning the rig.

1359
01:36:17,102 --> 01:36:19,228
Who in your view was in charge of the rig?

1360
01:36:19,429 --> 01:36:22,088
- The OIM. - That would be Mr. Harrell. Is that correct?

1361
01:36:22,188 --> 01:36:23,188
Right.

1362
01:36:25,277 --> 01:36:27,203
Jimmy Harrell still working for Transocean

1363
01:36:27,404 --> 01:36:28,838
There was a major explosion ...

1364
01:36:29,039 --> 01:36:32,058
followed by second explosion.

1365
01:36:32,259 --> 01:36:35,887
After the explosion, I called the rig floor. There was no answer.

1366
01:36:37,498 --> 01:36:39,568
BP supervisors. Robert Kaluza and Donald Vidrine

1367
01:36:39,592 --> 01:36:41,494
They were convicted of manslaughter

1368
01:36:41,586 --> 01:36:43,022
In 2015, these charges were dismissed.

1369
01:36:43,023 --> 01:36:45,635
Everything they told us could never happen ...

1370
01:36:45,836 --> 01:36:46,938
It happened.

1371
01:36:47,139 --> 01:36:48,733
Men lost their lives.

1372
01:36:50,438 --> 01:36:54,012
11 men died aboard the Deepwater Horizon of April 20, 2010.

1373
01:38:05,172 --> 01:38:08,391
The blowout lasted 87 days and spilled an estimated

1374
01:38:08,492 --> 01:38:13,712
210 million gallons of oil into the Gulf of Mexico.

1375
01:38:17,616 --> 01:38:23,597
It was the worst oil disaster in US history

1376
01:40:14,578 --> 01:40:19,899
