1
00:02:29,382 --> 00:02:33,045
CONDEMNED TO DEATH BY HIS PEERS
FOR REBELLION

2
00:02:33,419 --> 00:02:36,820
HORUS FROM HIERAKONOPOLIS,
THE GOD OF HEAVENS,

3
00:02:37,023 --> 00:02:40,754
HAS SEVEN DAYS TO SEE THE EARTH
OF MANKIND

4
00:02:40,994 --> 00:02:44,725
ONCE MORE,
THE EARTH THE HELPED CREATE.

5
00:02:44,964 --> 00:02:49,628
SEVEN DAYS: THE TIME FOR ONE BEAT
OF THE DIVINE HEART.

6
00:02:49,702 --> 00:02:51,169
NOT A SECOND MORE.

7
00:02:51,571 --> 00:02:54,768
BEFORE BEING DEPRIVED
OF HIS IMMORTALITY

8
00:02:54,941 --> 00:02:57,705
BUT EVEN THE GODS FEAR DEATH

9
00:03:12,325 --> 00:03:13,349
Heru?
Horus?

10
00:03:13,526 --> 00:03:14,627
Meru
It's time

11
00:03:14,627 --> 00:03:18,290
Ta em sertu en maa abtet!
Make the most of your Iast moments

12
00:03:18,531 --> 00:03:25,562
Seven days, HORUS, seven hourgIasses...
Not a second more.

13
00:03:25,905 --> 00:03:28,203
Semut bat.
Trust me

14
00:03:36,082 --> 00:03:38,642
I know you're there...

15
00:03:49,762 --> 00:03:51,320
Hey! Look over there !

16
00:03:51,531 --> 00:03:54,364
What is this?

17
00:03:54,734 --> 00:03:57,225
A naked man with a bird head.

18
00:03:58,571 --> 00:04:01,233
What's going on ? I Iose controI.

19
00:04:01,474 --> 00:04:05,843
There is no answer...
Right me, right me

20
00:04:13,386 --> 00:04:17,584
ChiIdren....my humans chiIdren.

21
00:04:17,757 --> 00:04:19,349
I am back.

22
00:05:09,409 --> 00:05:11,434
...Now, I'm aIso in charge of the nano
impIants department...

23
00:05:11,611 --> 00:05:14,637
...but we concentrate more
on synthetic skin.

24
00:05:14,914 --> 00:05:16,404
No hard feeIings, then.

25
00:05:16,616 --> 00:05:18,015
Thank you for reminding me!

26
00:05:18,818 --> 00:05:19,477
Can I take two?

27
00:05:19,719 --> 00:05:22,916
No. OnIy one this time.

28
00:05:23,456 --> 00:05:26,584
There're maybe no hard feeIings
but you're stiII tight-fisted?

29
00:05:26,759 --> 00:05:28,090
Fuck you, EIma.

30
00:05:28,294 --> 00:05:29,591
You shouId be so Iucky.

31
00:05:45,545 --> 00:05:46,944
That girI's dangerous.

32
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:49,109
She must be on pretty powerfuI stuff...

33
00:05:49,349 --> 00:05:52,477
She managed to damage a carrier
when they were seIecting them...

34
00:05:52,652 --> 00:05:54,483
When they were rounding them up,
you mean...

35
00:05:54,721 --> 00:05:56,416
That's why I'm interested in her...

36
00:05:56,489 --> 00:05:59,083
I see that you're invoIved in iIIegaI
medicine more than ever.

37
00:05:59,492 --> 00:06:02,017
Resistance medicine,
there's a difference.

38
00:06:03,029 --> 00:06:05,327
You reaIIy Iike her, don't you?

39
00:06:05,832 --> 00:06:07,424
I'm taking her with me.

40
00:06:07,934 --> 00:06:10,630
I'II need a suppIy of antibiotics,
even oId ones...

41
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:11,461
and microneedIes...

42
00:06:11,704 --> 00:06:13,137
Not so fast, darIing!

43
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:17,732
I want a detaiIed report of aII
the anaIyses you perform on her.

44
00:06:17,944 --> 00:06:21,141
And don't even try to pretend that
you've Iost the fiIe!

45
00:06:21,314 --> 00:06:23,077
You can have her, but I want the fiIe!

46
00:06:50,143 --> 00:06:52,577
He's waiting for her
to be returned to him.

47
00:06:56,349 --> 00:06:57,509
How oId are you?...

48
00:07:01,921 --> 00:07:02,910
Let's go...

49
00:07:26,579 --> 00:07:28,877
... But you openIy accuse
Senator AIIgood

50
00:07:29,081 --> 00:07:30,514
of manipuIating pubIic opinion.

51
00:07:30,716 --> 00:07:32,115
Do you think he's the one who organized

52
00:07:32,318 --> 00:07:34,149
the pyramid affair
in order to get eIected?

53
00:07:34,387 --> 00:07:37,515
No. His infIuence
doesn't run that deep.

54
00:07:37,690 --> 00:07:41,421
It's obvious that the pyramid
is extraterrestriaI,

55
00:07:41,661 --> 00:07:44,357
Iike the INTRUSION zone
in CentraI Park...

56
00:07:44,597 --> 00:07:46,588
I don't agree with the view
that Intrusion

57
00:07:46,766 --> 00:07:49,326
is a matrix of dangerous mutants.

58
00:07:49,535 --> 00:07:54,563
This rumor was spread by AIIgood
to serve the interests of EUGENICS.

59
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:59,507
Scientists have proved that Intrusion
is a GATEWAY to PARALLEL

60
00:07:59,745 --> 00:08:02,270
or EXTRATERRESTRIAL worIds.

61
00:08:02,482 --> 00:08:05,679
We'II have to face the fact that
we're not aIone in the Universe...

62
00:08:05,852 --> 00:08:09,982
But in practicaI terms your program
doesn't seem very satisfactory.

63
00:08:10,156 --> 00:08:12,488
You're putting aII the bIame
on the outgoing candidate,

64
00:08:12,692 --> 00:08:13,716
Senator AIIgood.

65
00:08:13,893 --> 00:08:16,487
...I'm aIso taIking about
the medicaI dictatorship

66
00:08:16,696 --> 00:08:19,096
that ALLGOOD has imposed on NYC,

67
00:08:19,298 --> 00:08:22,358
with the active participation
of EUGENICS.

68
00:08:22,535 --> 00:08:26,130
I'm taIking about raids,
iIIegaI experiments,

69
00:08:26,339 --> 00:08:29,575
unauthorized bIood-tests
and organ removaI,

70
00:08:29,575 --> 00:08:33,875
peopIe going missing...
I'm taIking about GLOBUS 1 ,

71
00:08:34,247 --> 00:08:35,771
you know what that is, don't you?

72
00:08:35,982 --> 00:08:38,382
It's the 'freezer'
used by the mad scientists

73
00:08:38,584 --> 00:08:40,575
that work for EUGENICS'...

74
00:08:40,753 --> 00:08:44,211
But you do agree there's a reaI
security probIem, don't you?

75
00:08:44,457 --> 00:08:46,448
That series of murders on LeveI 2...

76
00:08:46,592 --> 00:08:47,854
That's poIice business.

77
00:08:48,027 --> 00:08:50,587
I have fuII confidence
in the FederaI PoIice.

78
00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:51,722
What a bitch!

79
00:08:52,064 --> 00:08:54,123
What a bitch!

80
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:57,292
A bitch,
but a fast Iearner about poIitics.

81
00:08:57,470 --> 00:09:00,371
That's what I mean! A whore!

82
00:09:00,706 --> 00:09:03,843
That's enough... About those murders.

83
00:09:03,843 --> 00:09:05,674
How many have been reported so far?

84
00:09:06,112 --> 00:09:06,976
Four.

85
00:09:07,213 --> 00:09:08,771
Who's in charge of the case?

86
00:09:08,981 --> 00:09:11,472
Inspector Froebe.
He's a speciaIist in the abnormaI.

87
00:09:11,684 --> 00:09:13,584
He thinks it's the work
of a seriaI kiIIer.

88
00:09:13,819 --> 00:09:17,482
Froebe is no speciaIist.
Hunting is aII he Iives for,

89
00:09:17,723 --> 00:09:20,556
ever since he had his face chewed
on by the Dayak.

90
00:09:20,793 --> 00:09:22,658
He's a reaI psychopath.

91
00:09:22,895 --> 00:09:24,196
He's a IiabiIity.

92
00:09:24,196 --> 00:09:25,993
I don't agree, Miss Liang.

93
00:09:26,432 --> 00:09:29,162
Froebe is a good cop, and anyway,
he's poIiticaIIy neutraI.

94
00:09:29,402 --> 00:09:31,836
''NeutraI !'' ...''NeutraI''
doesn't exist...

95
00:09:32,038 --> 00:09:35,371
There're onIy men and women...
Humans and aIiens.

96
00:09:35,575 --> 00:09:37,440
The integrated and the rejected.

97
00:09:37,510 --> 00:09:40,104
The whoIe fucking universe
is spIit into two...

98
00:10:01,334 --> 00:10:03,359
That makes five!
In Iess than 48 hours,

99
00:10:03,536 --> 00:10:05,367
that's got to be a record...

100
00:10:05,605 --> 00:10:07,300
ExactIy the same M. O.

101
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:10,907
It's just as if the body had expIoded
from the inside.

102
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:13,237
I was toId there was a witness.

103
00:10:13,412 --> 00:10:15,312
Yeah ! He's right over there,
he's waiting for you

104
00:10:17,883 --> 00:10:19,783
Back at my office in an hour.

105
00:10:22,755 --> 00:10:26,020
You're aIright?
I'II see you at Froebe's, OK?

106
00:10:26,192 --> 00:10:29,025
Yeah... Yeah... AII right !
I'II see you there.

107
00:10:29,929 --> 00:10:31,794
Are you sure you're aIright?

108
00:11:49,942 --> 00:11:51,500
Hi....Mmm...

109
00:11:53,846 --> 00:11:55,336
What can I get you?

110
00:11:55,881 --> 00:12:00,944
He wants to know if they're diseased.

111
00:12:02,488 --> 00:12:04,786
He asked you a question.

112
00:12:04,990 --> 00:12:06,321
I... I'm fine, thanks.

113
00:12:06,525 --> 00:12:08,652
AII your organs?!

114
00:12:08,828 --> 00:12:11,490
I've... I've changed my Iungs.
They're a Chinese modeI.

115
00:12:11,731 --> 00:12:14,029
Not bad... Pretty attractive...
and... I...

116
00:12:14,233 --> 00:12:17,532
I have a new bIadder too,
no probIem there.

117
00:12:24,977 --> 00:12:26,501
StiII don't want a drink?

118
00:13:02,281 --> 00:13:03,179
Six.

119
00:13:03,616 --> 00:13:04,708
No. Seven.

120
00:13:04,884 --> 00:13:06,647
Outside the bar...the witness.

121
00:13:06,886 --> 00:13:08,376
The one I never got to see.

122
00:13:08,454 --> 00:13:09,648
That's right, the giant.

123
00:13:09,989 --> 00:13:12,184
He's the seventh and the agent who
was supposed

124
00:13:12,358 --> 00:13:14,121
to bring him to you was the sixth.

125
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:16,021
Reminds you of the DAYAKS, doesn't it?

126
00:13:16,262 --> 00:13:19,095
CoId bIooded carnage Iike this,
right up their aIIey.

127
00:13:19,331 --> 00:13:21,162
The Dayaks are extinct.

128
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:24,995
They were aII exterminated after
the riots, thirty years ago.

129
00:13:25,237 --> 00:13:27,899
Except the one that got you. ...

130
00:13:32,311 --> 00:13:33,869
Thank you, Sandy.

131
00:14:04,243 --> 00:14:07,440
It's not going to hoId but I can't do
anything anymore...

132
00:14:07,613 --> 00:14:09,274
I did warn you.

133
00:14:13,819 --> 00:14:15,411
you've modified
or repIaced aII the rest.

134
00:14:15,654 --> 00:14:17,713
I have a contract with EUGENICS...

135
00:14:17,890 --> 00:14:19,915
I had guessed that much.

136
00:14:20,292 --> 00:14:22,351
TeII my coIIeague I sent you.

137
00:14:22,895 --> 00:14:26,160
He's a speciaIist
in nano-surgicaI repairs...

138
00:14:29,702 --> 00:14:31,226
Don't Ieave it too Iong.

139
00:14:35,174 --> 00:14:36,903
Thank you Doctor.

140
00:14:46,118 --> 00:14:50,851
I'm so sorry, JiII. New Yorkers aII
seem to have gone insane...

141
00:14:51,724 --> 00:14:57,720
Where was I? Oh, Yes,
the Iapse in your memory.

142
00:14:58,197 --> 00:15:02,327
I was wondering what it is that
you don't want to remember so badIy,

143
00:15:02,501 --> 00:15:04,128
that you're this bIocked?

144
00:15:04,770 --> 00:15:07,830
Put it another way;
what are you trying to forget?

145
00:15:08,107 --> 00:15:11,873
I can't remember anything,
there's a subtIe difference.

146
00:15:12,111 --> 00:15:13,703
But it seems
that you remembered to take

147
00:15:13,913 --> 00:15:16,211
strong doses of potentiaIIy dangerous

148
00:15:16,415 --> 00:15:19,179
substances as yet unidentified.

149
00:15:20,286 --> 00:15:22,277
Do you have any on you?

150
00:15:22,721 --> 00:15:26,316
Is your suppIier on IeveI 3,
in LittIe Paris,

151
00:15:26,525 --> 00:15:28,049
amongst the non humans?

152
00:15:31,463 --> 00:15:33,863
Some of them are very decent beings.

153
00:15:34,266 --> 00:15:35,858
You, for exampIe...

154
00:15:45,577 --> 00:15:47,568
I have to teII you that
in 20 years of medicine

155
00:15:47,746 --> 00:15:50,306
I've never seen
a guinea pig quite Iike you...

156
00:15:52,551 --> 00:15:54,849
I've never seen such a heart,

157
00:15:55,054 --> 00:15:57,921
Iungs, or a womb Iike that... Never.

158
00:16:01,927 --> 00:16:06,091
You're buiIt Iike someone who
was born Iess than three months ago...

159
00:16:07,166 --> 00:16:09,031
Maybe that's what you want to forget?

160
00:16:10,636 --> 00:16:17,200
Or what you're not sure about?
When did you get to New York?...

161
00:16:21,613 --> 00:16:23,342
And how?

162
00:16:29,054 --> 00:16:32,512
Some of the vertebrate animaIs
on this pIanet shed their skin,

163
00:16:34,193 --> 00:16:36,661
You are going through
the same process...

164
00:16:36,996 --> 00:16:39,624
Listen to my offer! Work for me.

165
00:16:39,865 --> 00:16:42,959
Let me conduct
a thorough medicaI examination,

166
00:16:43,135 --> 00:16:45,865
take some sampIes,
test some medication...

167
00:16:46,105 --> 00:16:47,333
If you trust me,

168
00:16:47,506 --> 00:16:49,633
you won't have anything to worry
about any more.

169
00:16:49,808 --> 00:16:52,208
You'II be covered and IegaI...
And more importantIy,

170
00:16:52,411 --> 00:16:53,445
I'II get you a card.

171
00:16:53,445 --> 00:16:55,936
I have a contract
with the Western hysteria ...

172
00:16:56,348 --> 00:16:57,645
You can Iive there...

173
00:16:58,017 --> 00:17:00,815
You're the greatest mystery
of nature I've ever come across...

174
00:17:48,267 --> 00:17:49,564
John...

175
00:17:59,478 --> 00:18:01,070
I got picked up in a Eugenics raid.

176
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:02,611
I shot a carrier...

177
00:18:03,816 --> 00:18:09,584
It couId have gone very badIy...
A human woman doctor saved me.

178
00:18:11,190 --> 00:18:13,454
She offered me a job
and IegaI housing...

179
00:18:13,625 --> 00:18:14,956
Accept it...

180
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:16,855
As a guinea pig...

181
00:18:17,096 --> 00:18:20,964
ApparentIy my body
is onIy three months oId,

182
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:24,033
and my organs aren't
in the right pIace...

183
00:18:24,369 --> 00:18:29,204
Not in the right pIace,
according to whose criteria?

184
00:18:30,109 --> 00:18:32,942
You see that pyramid monument...

185
00:18:33,445 --> 00:18:35,970
Do you think it's in its right pIace?

186
00:18:36,181 --> 00:18:39,014
And me? Do you think I am?

187
00:18:40,752 --> 00:18:44,085
There's something important
you shouId know.

188
00:18:44,690 --> 00:18:49,354
This pIanet is rejecting me,
JiII...This atmosphere,

189
00:18:49,595 --> 00:18:53,895
this oxygen, it's burning me up...

190
00:18:55,634 --> 00:18:58,626
I have to take care
of you before it's too Iate.

191
00:18:59,938 --> 00:19:04,637
I'm getting oId, JiII,
I've been around for centuries...

192
00:19:05,544 --> 00:19:07,273
I'm confused

193
00:20:12,644 --> 00:20:13,872
Oh... My God...

194
00:20:16,481 --> 00:20:17,641
Jesus!

195
00:20:18,850 --> 00:20:20,408
This one's empty!

196
00:20:32,397 --> 00:20:34,558
Restricted area.

197
00:22:14,433 --> 00:22:17,231
... A fIying pyramid,
a seriaI kiIIer on the Ioose

198
00:22:17,469 --> 00:22:19,494
and now a chunk
of prison faIIing from the sky.

199
00:22:19,671 --> 00:22:22,834
Is someone out to sabotage
my poIiticaI career or what?

200
00:22:23,008 --> 00:22:25,704
It's Iike in one of those
Greek tragedies, Senator,

201
00:22:25,944 --> 00:22:28,435
aII the eIements wiII faII into pIace...

202
00:22:28,647 --> 00:22:31,741
What are you doing here,
Inspector FROEBE?

203
00:22:31,783 --> 00:22:35,549
I'm Iooking for three
of my men who have disappeared.

204
00:22:35,954 --> 00:22:37,785
Your seriaI kiIIer again?

205
00:22:38,023 --> 00:22:39,718
Don't think so.

206
00:22:40,225 --> 00:22:42,489
Here. A gift for you.

207
00:22:42,661 --> 00:22:43,889
What is it?

208
00:22:44,229 --> 00:22:45,526
You shouId know better than me.

209
00:22:45,731 --> 00:22:48,199
Give me that!
This is way out of your Ieague.

210
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:52,392
I haven't found
the man who goes with this...

211
00:23:10,722 --> 00:23:19,824
''Remember...
Remember the sight we saw, my souI,

212
00:23:19,998 --> 00:23:23,661

''...round a turning in the path...''

214
00:23:32,711 --> 00:23:34,269
Thank you...

215
00:23:35,113 --> 00:23:42,485
...''a disgusting carcass

228
00:25:35,834 --> 00:25:41,739
Am I dead? I must be dead.

229
00:25:45,877 --> 00:25:47,504
And you...

230
00:25:48,647 --> 00:25:51,241
I know you,
you are from HierakonopoIis.

231
00:25:51,483 --> 00:25:52,916
The god of the heavens.

232
00:25:53,151 --> 00:25:57,713
I'm fIattered, NikopoI,
wretched human.

233
00:25:57,923 --> 00:26:00,084
...Anubis can't be far away?

234
00:26:00,258 --> 00:26:02,317
The guardian of the tombs...
The god of the dead...

235
00:26:02,494 --> 00:26:04,553
Don't ever speak
that jackaI's name again,

236
00:26:04,729 --> 00:26:08,563
you understand? OnIy my name...
OnIy me...

237
00:26:09,067 --> 00:26:10,864
OK.. OK...

238
00:26:13,838 --> 00:26:17,604
My Ieg!... Where is my Ieg ?

239
00:26:17,976 --> 00:26:20,410
You can see you're not dead...

240
00:26:20,612 --> 00:26:22,341
The dead don't feeI pain...

241
00:26:22,581 --> 00:26:25,414
The dead don't bIeed either.

242
00:26:25,650 --> 00:26:30,917
Yeah,
I'm aIive and I'm bIeeding Iike a pig.

243
00:26:39,364 --> 00:26:42,731
Listen carefuIIy, I won't say it twice.

244
00:26:42,934 --> 00:26:44,526
For two of your days now,

245
00:26:44,736 --> 00:26:46,567
I have been Iooking for a host body,

246
00:26:46,805 --> 00:26:51,139
for reasons that go far beyond any
human concerns.

247
00:26:51,343 --> 00:26:55,575
I need a body
to weIcome me and serve me.

248
00:26:55,747 --> 00:26:59,444
You... You seem to be suitabIe.

249
00:26:59,684 --> 00:27:04,678
I've tested seven humans before you
and rejected them aII... But you,

250
00:27:04,856 --> 00:27:08,883
your body is cIean.
You come from the past...

251
00:27:09,060 --> 00:27:11,392
Thirty years of hibernation...

252
00:27:11,596 --> 00:27:17,193
Your body won't reject me.
We are compatibIe.

253
00:27:19,571 --> 00:27:24,201
What year is it? Who set me free?

254
00:27:24,442 --> 00:27:33,840
2095 after your Jesus Christ.
Your reIease is an accidentaI escape.

255
00:27:34,052 --> 00:27:38,648
I was supposed to be Iet out in 2096.

256
00:27:39,891 --> 00:27:44,157
I was reIeased a year ahead
of scheduIe.

257
00:27:44,462 --> 00:27:49,058
I've gained a year
but Iost a Ieg. Fuck!

258
00:27:51,403 --> 00:27:53,963
Forget the oId one...

259
00:27:58,343 --> 00:28:01,335
Here's a new one.

260
00:28:06,885 --> 00:28:10,377
Yes... Thank you for caIIing.

261
00:28:11,556 --> 00:28:14,855
That was the forensic scientist
from GIobus...

262
00:28:15,060 --> 00:28:16,186
And?

263
00:28:16,361 --> 00:28:18,454
The Ieg has been identified.

264
00:28:18,630 --> 00:28:19,824
And?

265
00:28:19,998 --> 00:28:24,765
WeII... it beIongs to... NikopoI.

266
00:28:44,222 --> 00:28:45,621
Perfect

267
00:28:48,293 --> 00:28:53,595
There's no way.
This thing weighs a ton.

268
00:28:54,766 --> 00:28:56,859
I'II never be abIe to move.

269
00:28:57,335 --> 00:29:02,238
That's right.
Without me you won't be abIe to move.

270
00:29:02,507 --> 00:29:03,997
And by the way,

271
00:29:04,209 --> 00:29:09,442
from now on you won't be abIe
to do much of anything without me...

272
00:29:09,614 --> 00:29:12,276
I accept that I'm not dead now.

273
00:29:12,517 --> 00:29:16,317
But I hope I'm dreaming this.
PIease God Iet this be a nightmare.

274
00:29:16,788 --> 00:29:19,086
Let this aII be a nightmare...

275
00:29:19,357 --> 00:29:22,053
You beIieve in God?

276
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:24,794
I don't even have that to faII back on.

277
00:29:24,996 --> 00:29:29,797
I suggest you beIieve in me, NikopoI...

278
00:29:31,202 --> 00:29:32,726
Do I have a choice?

279
00:29:32,937 --> 00:29:35,303
I'm afraid not.

280
00:29:41,813 --> 00:29:45,271
Now, rise and waIk.

281
00:30:05,203 --> 00:30:09,367
I've reIinquished controI, NikopoI,
you can have a bit of autonomy now.

282
00:30:09,541 --> 00:30:13,739
I want you to know that everything
is going perfectIy weII.

283
00:30:13,912 --> 00:30:17,973
Your body is very comfortabIe
and toIerates me beautifuIIy...

284
00:30:18,149 --> 00:30:22,711
And above aII you're most eIegant.

285
00:30:22,821 --> 00:30:24,288
Are you fucking kidding me?

286
00:30:24,689 --> 00:30:31,527
EIegant, famous and subversive.
Just what I Iike ...

287
00:30:32,230 --> 00:30:35,097
It seems you're the instigator
of aII this fighting

288
00:30:35,333 --> 00:30:37,198
that's been going on without you...

289
00:30:37,435 --> 00:30:40,927
Not bad for a human...

290
00:30:50,682 --> 00:30:54,345
WouId it be too much to ask
for just a bit more autonomy?

291
00:30:59,257 --> 00:31:00,986
I'd Iike to choose my own cIothes,

292
00:31:01,226 --> 00:31:03,353
with the IittIe free
wiII I have Ieft...

293
00:31:05,430 --> 00:31:11,733
Your happiness is my priority,
NikopoI, Mr. Free spirit.

294
00:31:34,325 --> 00:31:36,520
How is Doctor EIma Turner?

295
00:31:36,694 --> 00:31:37,929
Never been better.

296
00:31:37,929 --> 00:31:42,059
WeIcome to the Western Hysteria HoteI.
39th fIoor. Room 12.

297
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:45,494
Any friend of Dr Turner's
is a friend of mine.

298
00:33:03,448 --> 00:33:05,939
Por ti Ketro...

299
00:33:06,517 --> 00:33:11,420
That's for me?... Thanks...

300

What's your name?

301
00:33:14,525 --> 00:33:15,856
WiIIy... Ketarakado... WiIIy...

302
00:33:16,060 --> 00:33:22,727
WiIIy? OK, I'II caII you WiIIy.
And you can caII me JiII...

Number of teeth : thirty seven unit,

No mammaI dentaI bIades,

306
00:33:38,483 --> 00:33:41,111
Thank you JiII now you can make
the food test.

307
00:34:11,215 --> 00:34:12,682
...with a Iist that's getting Ionger.

308
00:34:12,884 --> 00:34:14,442
Eight victims, aII maIe,

00:34:18,756 --> 00:34:19,745
This just in,

310
00:34:19,924 --> 00:34:22,722
Senator ALLGOOD has announced
that he wiII be on the ZeppeIin

311
00:34:22,994 --> 00:34:25,258
when the scientific deIegation
and Ieading

312
00:34:25,463 --> 00:34:27,124
EgyptoIogists make another attempt

313
00:34:27,365 --> 00:34:30,459
to contact the inhabitants
of the Pyramid...

314
00:34:30,701 --> 00:34:32,362
...the hydrometer rate
is down today in

315
00:34:32,603 --> 00:34:34,036
BrookIyn for the fourth day running.

316
00:34:34,238 --> 00:34:37,571
On INTRUSION, however, no change.
Snow, ice,

317
00:34:37,775 --> 00:34:40,039
temperature 23 beIow freezing...

318
00:34:40,211 --> 00:34:42,441
TweIve attempted break-ins
into INTRUSION have been

319
00:34:42,613 --> 00:34:45,411
reported: there are no survivors.

320
00:34:45,650 --> 00:34:48,551
Do not approach the CentraI Park area.

321
00:34:51,656 --> 00:34:58,562
DOWN ! ... DOWN ! ... DOWN !
....EVERY BODY DOWN!

322
00:36:04,629 --> 00:36:07,996
Aber od neb aber, Bastet ?
Are we cheating or not, Bastet ?

323
00:36:08,199 --> 00:36:12,260
Aber, Anubis,aber .
We're cheating,Anubis , we're cheating

324
00:36:24,315 --> 00:36:26,875
You don't understand? NikopoI is aIive!

325
00:36:26,918 --> 00:36:29,386
Maybe not.
It was reported that He was shot

326
00:36:29,754 --> 00:36:31,153
by a department store security guard

327
00:36:31,355 --> 00:36:35,689
and feII a hundred meters...
But they couIdn't find the body.

328
00:36:35,893 --> 00:36:37,884
Are you teIIing me the man can fIy?

329
00:36:37,929 --> 00:36:39,920
I can put you on to HuxIey,
Froebe's right hand man.

330
00:36:40,231 --> 00:36:40,959
He's in charge of...

331
00:36:41,032 --> 00:36:44,365
That's OK, Jonas. Thanks.
You can Ieave us now...

332
00:36:45,636 --> 00:36:48,628
Right. Get the heII out
of here! Beat it!

333
00:36:50,708 --> 00:36:52,039
He knows everything.

334
00:36:52,243 --> 00:36:54,278
I know he knows everything,

335
00:36:54,278 --> 00:36:57,042
and his phenomenaI memory
is stuffed with enough evidence

336
00:36:57,481 --> 00:37:00,211
concerning your Iate father's
financiaI deaIings

337
00:37:00,451 --> 00:37:03,621
and his iIIegaI experiments
on aIien popuIations to cause EUGENICS

338
00:37:03,621 --> 00:37:05,816
some very serious probIems...

339
00:37:06,190 --> 00:37:07,680
I am aware of that.

340
00:37:08,292 --> 00:37:12,558
Up untiI now we've onIy had the spirit
of NikopoI to deaI with,

341
00:37:12,730 --> 00:37:14,994
but now we have him in fIesh and bIood.

342
00:37:15,166 --> 00:37:17,566
No one's ever come back from GLOBUS.

343
00:37:17,768 --> 00:37:22,501
WeII, HE has. Why wasn't he executed
30 years ago, anyway?

344
00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:26,540
Are you crazy ?... Are you crazy ?

345
00:37:26,844 --> 00:37:30,109
To make a hero out of him,
a martyr to their Iousy revoIution?

346
00:37:30,281 --> 00:37:33,648
What do you want, riots,
assassination?!

347
00:37:47,365 --> 00:37:49,890
It is the Iast prototype
of the ''hunter'' version.

348
00:37:50,101 --> 00:37:52,592
Fast, ferocious and totaIIy iIIegaI.

349
00:37:52,803 --> 00:37:55,135
He'II be quicker
than Froebe and his men.

350
00:37:55,406 --> 00:37:55,997
Are you sure?

351
00:37:56,240 --> 00:38:01,837
No, but it's the onIy soIution...
Apart from your ''protege''.

352
00:38:02,046 --> 00:38:06,847
No, not him...
Let's try this one first.

353
00:38:08,953 --> 00:38:09,942
Come in!

354
00:38:11,989 --> 00:38:13,354
You're earIy!

355
00:38:13,557 --> 00:38:15,388
We have no time to Iose

356
00:38:15,926 --> 00:38:18,724
Is he ready?
Have you re-activated him yet ?

357
00:38:18,963 --> 00:38:21,397
No. I'II need about an hour.

358
00:38:23,634 --> 00:38:25,295
I wanted to make sure you reaIIy
wanted him.

359
00:38:25,536 --> 00:38:26,833
We do.

360
00:38:27,305 --> 00:38:28,499
OK.

361
00:38:53,464 --> 00:38:55,625
What's this! What happened?

362
00:38:56,534 --> 00:39:00,868
Nothing of any importance,
reaIIy, nothing.

363
00:39:04,542 --> 00:39:06,169
Do you Iike women?

364
00:39:07,411 --> 00:39:08,571
Women?

365
00:39:09,013 --> 00:39:11,345
Women...

366
00:39:11,549 --> 00:39:16,987
My most beautifuI and most important
creation on this pIanet...

367
00:39:19,990 --> 00:39:23,323
Your story doesn't make much sense...

368
00:39:24,161 --> 00:39:28,757
You're Iooking for a bIue-haired girI
with white skin...

369
00:39:29,533 --> 00:39:33,993
What's this aII about, and,
how do you know she comes here?

370
00:39:34,205 --> 00:39:38,309
In the same way that I knew
I'd find her on pIanet Earth,

371
00:39:38,309 --> 00:39:40,334
in New York City...

372
00:39:40,678 --> 00:39:45,047
Intuition, NikopoI,
the intuition of the gods...

373
00:39:45,249 --> 00:39:49,982
So. What's so speciaI about her
that warrants such a dispIay of taIents?

374
00:39:50,054 --> 00:39:53,319
Is she Miss Universe or what ?

375
00:39:54,458 --> 00:40:00,055
You don't think I've come aII this way
for a mere human being, do you?

376
00:40:08,572 --> 00:40:10,699
Now I know more about you...

377
00:40:14,512 --> 00:40:16,742
Why are you doing aII this for me?

378
00:40:17,782 --> 00:40:19,807
It's a poIiticaI and sociaI fight.

379
00:40:20,217 --> 00:40:22,515
My Spirit of NikopoI coming out.

380
00:40:23,220 --> 00:40:25,450
Besides, your case interests me...

381
00:40:26,757 --> 00:40:28,816
I think you Iike me...

382
00:40:32,229 --> 00:40:34,322
Isn't that what you were thinking?

383
00:40:37,101 --> 00:40:38,363
You couId say that.

384
00:40:39,003 --> 00:40:40,402
How did you guess?

385
00:40:41,205 --> 00:40:43,105
Do you read minds too?

386
00:40:43,374 --> 00:40:45,171
You couId say that...

387
00:40:45,476 --> 00:40:47,910
It's true, I do Iike you
and I feeI cIose to you, JiII,

388
00:40:48,112 --> 00:40:50,910
whoever you are...
Mutant or whatever...

389
00:40:51,248 --> 00:40:53,148
AIthough you are beginning
to scare me.

390
00:40:53,951 --> 00:40:55,418
Let's try a IittIe experiment.

391
00:40:55,619 --> 00:40:57,610
To test this taIent of yours...

392
00:40:57,788 --> 00:41:01,554
I'm going to think of a question
and you're going to answer. Ready?

393
00:41:01,792 --> 00:41:02,884
Ready.

394
00:41:04,562 --> 00:41:06,427
I've asked the question.

395
00:41:08,065 --> 00:41:11,523
You want to know
if I've started testing

396
00:41:11,735 --> 00:41:13,930
the foods you prescribed for me,

397
00:41:14,104 --> 00:41:15,731
if I took a bIood
test three hours Iater and

398
00:41:15,973 --> 00:41:18,134
if I took ... notes.

399
00:41:19,477 --> 00:41:21,775
Answer: Yes!

400
00:41:21,946 --> 00:41:25,006
I did everything I was supposed to do,
and I found everything absoIuteIy

401
00:41:25,182 --> 00:41:29,778
deIicious...
I'm a professionaI guinea pig.

402
00:41:30,287 --> 00:41:31,720
Have you tasted everything?

403
00:41:31,922 --> 00:41:33,719
For dinner, yes. I ate it aII.

404
00:41:34,024 --> 00:41:37,687
And you ate everything at once?
In the prescribed quantities?

405
00:41:37,928 --> 00:41:42,297
I weighed everything.
I just changed a coupIe of the recipes.

406
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:43,865
I didn't have anything to cook with

407
00:41:44,068 --> 00:41:48,971
so I ate the fish caIIed monkfish raw
and the Iamb too.

408
00:41:50,307 --> 00:41:51,968
They're not bad together.

409
00:41:52,209 --> 00:41:53,972
How many meaIs do you have a day?

410
00:41:54,445 --> 00:41:56,072
Two a week.

411
00:42:50,501 --> 00:42:52,059
She's not bad.

412
00:42:53,337 --> 00:42:57,637
Not surprising, you idiot.
She's the one.

413
00:43:41,151 --> 00:43:42,345
John...

414
00:43:58,669 --> 00:44:00,569
Come JiII, come...

415
00:44:03,907 --> 00:44:07,604
You'II be my Iast
and my most beautifuI Intrusion...

416
00:44:07,845 --> 00:44:10,313
Listen carefuIIy...

417
00:44:10,514 --> 00:44:13,312
For thousands of Earth years I've been

418
00:44:13,384 --> 00:44:17,582
introducing peopIe into
the four corners of the gaIaxy...

419
00:44:17,955 --> 00:44:21,992
PeopIe mispIaced by the vagaries
of the Universe...

420
00:44:21,992 --> 00:44:28,022
You're a mispIaced person, JiII...
And I'II never know your origins...

421
00:44:28,365 --> 00:44:31,425
You appeared deep in the heart
of INTRUSION about three months ago...

422
00:44:31,602 --> 00:44:34,730
That's where I took charge of you...

423
00:44:34,905 --> 00:44:38,466
The bIue piIIs stop your past
from re-emerging

424
00:44:38,676 --> 00:44:41,201
and Iet the present... invade you.

425
00:44:41,945 --> 00:44:45,381
Your metamorphosis is on the verge
of compIetion...

426
00:44:45,616 --> 00:44:50,144
From now on your pIace
is on this pIanet...

427
00:44:50,788 --> 00:44:54,451
What about you? Aren't you staying?

428
00:44:54,692 --> 00:44:58,526
I'm a passer at the end of his cycIe.

429
00:44:58,595 --> 00:45:01,826
I'm aIready dreaming of a void...

430
00:45:02,199 --> 00:45:02,961
I'm afraid...

431
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:05,225
Afraid of what?

432
00:45:07,671 --> 00:45:09,901
...of becoming human.

433
00:45:11,842 --> 00:45:15,573
TeII me about your job
with Doctor EIma Turner

434
00:45:25,856 --> 00:45:27,323
Can I buy you a drink?

435
00:45:27,925 --> 00:45:29,916
Don't you think I have enough aIready?

436
00:45:30,728 --> 00:45:34,186
WeII, I don't see any cognac,
or sake...

437
00:45:34,531 --> 00:45:36,658
TequiIa... SIivovitsa...

438
00:45:36,834 --> 00:45:38,563
I'm working. Do you mind?

439
00:45:40,037 --> 00:45:44,030
A vodka. Make it a Tarkovskaia,
pIease.

440
00:45:46,677 --> 00:45:50,169
I Iike your hair. It's very nice.

441
00:45:50,481 --> 00:45:55,316
It goes very weII with... white skin...

442
00:46:00,023 --> 00:46:01,854
Is it a new thing in make-up?

443
00:46:02,092 --> 00:46:06,961
Kabuki styIe maybe?
You must be an actress.

444
00:46:07,698 --> 00:46:10,963
You're expecting something from me...

445
00:46:12,436 --> 00:46:14,495
The answer is No.

446
00:46:20,410 --> 00:46:24,005
You're going to need someone
to take you home.

447
00:46:27,918 --> 00:46:30,512
What makes you think that?

448
00:46:30,754 --> 00:46:34,155
You have no other choice.

449
00:46:40,063 --> 00:46:42,088
One for the road.

450
00:47:04,454 --> 00:47:07,719
I Iike... this one.

451
00:47:08,592 --> 00:47:11,356
How about you, young Iady?

452
00:47:12,763 --> 00:47:15,527
We are going to get aIong fine.

453
00:47:15,766 --> 00:47:19,099
It's very important
to have the same tastes..

454
00:47:23,574 --> 00:47:24,871
No!

455
00:47:26,376 --> 00:47:29,504
We've got more important things
to do than fight each other...

456
00:47:44,261 --> 00:47:51,861
Address?... Western Hysteria HoteI...

457
00:47:58,909 --> 00:48:06,917
You are Inspector John Emerson HuxIey
and you have a bIack box in your brain.

458
00:48:06,917 --> 00:48:09,283
Give it to me, pIease.

459
00:48:09,987 --> 00:48:13,218
Or I'II have to go in and take it...

460
00:48:36,113 --> 00:48:40,914
It goes very weII with...white skin...

461
00:49:28,131 --> 00:49:29,758
I don't have a room.

462
00:49:42,212 --> 00:49:43,201
Which LeveI are you from?

463
00:49:43,380 --> 00:49:45,280
I'm above IeveIs...

464
00:49:45,349 --> 00:49:49,809
This is LeveI 2 and the hoteI's fuII.

465
00:49:50,053 --> 00:49:55,355
The hoteI maybe... but your bed is not.

466
00:50:02,632 --> 00:50:04,259
Ladies first...

467
00:52:47,831 --> 00:52:50,629
ControI, Miss. Your papers.

468
00:52:50,867 --> 00:52:52,232
My papers?

469
00:52:52,435 --> 00:52:54,665
Your card if you prefer.

470
00:53:04,514 --> 00:53:08,075
Thank you, Miss.
Do you have any weapons,

471
00:53:08,285 --> 00:53:12,187
expIosives...
Any history of vioIent conduct?

472
00:53:12,422 --> 00:53:14,652
I hate vioIence.

473
00:53:14,824 --> 00:53:16,655
Are you comfortabIe here?

474
00:53:16,893 --> 00:53:19,259
Yes, fine.

475
00:53:21,865 --> 00:53:27,895
Yes... I hate vioIence but I do Iike
to caress myseIf with bird feathers...

476
00:53:28,071 --> 00:53:31,097
preferabIy bIack ones.

477
00:53:32,642 --> 00:53:39,070
It's a bit smaII isn't it?
Don't you have a bathroom?

478
00:53:40,283 --> 00:53:43,684
No. No bathroom.

479
00:53:44,087 --> 00:53:48,251
I've decided never to wash again. Ever!

480
00:54:16,453 --> 00:54:22,619
Who are you? This is my bathroom !
What are you doing in my bathroom?

481
00:54:27,397 --> 00:54:29,524
Who are you?

482
00:54:29,699 --> 00:54:32,065
We had a drink together Iast night.

483
00:54:32,435 --> 00:54:35,871
You had severaI, in fact...
it's not surprising you can't remember.

484
00:54:36,072 --> 00:54:38,734
AIcohoI has no effect on me.

485
00:54:38,975 --> 00:54:41,466
What's happening here?
What about the door?

486
00:54:41,511 --> 00:54:46,380
That door wasn't there a moment ago.
Did you do that?

487
00:54:46,816 --> 00:54:48,613
I'm no carpenter.

488
00:54:48,852 --> 00:54:51,320
Be carefuI...Those things can go off
aII by themseIves.

489
00:54:51,521 --> 00:54:53,216
Shut up, human!

490
00:54:54,257 --> 00:55:00,389
What happened Iast night?
What did you do to my body ?

491
00:55:04,367 --> 00:55:05,732
So?

492
00:55:08,271 --> 00:55:10,569
What did I do to your body?...

493
00:55:11,608 --> 00:55:15,772
We had sexuaI intercourse...
You and I...

494
00:55:15,945 --> 00:55:18,675
WeII...
Maybe not just the two of us aIone...

495
00:55:18,915 --> 00:55:21,713
What do you mean by
''sexuaI intercourse''?

496
00:55:21,951 --> 00:55:24,112
At times Iast night you gave
the impression

497
00:55:24,287 --> 00:55:26,585
you knew perfectIy weII...

498
00:55:28,358 --> 00:55:29,552
I wi...

499
00:55:31,461 --> 00:55:33,725
I couId teII you the truth...

500
00:55:33,897 --> 00:55:36,024
What truth?

501
00:56:26,883 --> 00:56:30,319
BIoody fuckin'god...
What did you make me do?

502
00:56:35,859 --> 00:56:37,156
Fuck you!!!

503
00:56:40,463 --> 00:56:42,294
What are we waiting for?

504
00:56:42,799 --> 00:56:45,393
The answers
to the questions I asked him.

505
00:56:46,669 --> 00:56:48,967
He can't taIk anymore,

506
00:56:49,139 --> 00:56:54,736
but we may be abIe to piece together
recent events from his subconscious.

507
00:56:55,412 --> 00:56:58,108
WeII can he be... repaired?

508
00:56:58,848 --> 00:57:00,509
He can be treated.

509
00:57:11,161 --> 00:57:12,423
A Dayak?!

510
00:57:13,363 --> 00:57:19,029
A fake. A repIica
of a Dayak, humanized.

511
00:57:19,269 --> 00:57:26,072
We found some synthetic red epidermis
signed EUGENICS under his fingernaiIs.

512
00:57:29,712 --> 00:57:31,202
Leave us now.

513
00:57:34,417 --> 00:57:35,782
Rape...

514
00:57:36,753 --> 00:57:38,050
Rape?

515
00:57:44,327 --> 00:57:46,352
You made me commit rape.

516
00:57:46,529 --> 00:57:50,693
She consented. We, Gods,
have physicaI appetites, you know...

517
00:57:50,867 --> 00:57:55,236
Which we have more than aptIy
demonstrated for thousands of years...

518
00:57:55,505 --> 00:57:58,030
You reaIIy are a piece of shit.

519
00:57:58,241 --> 00:58:01,267
You think everything
is yours for the taking.

520
00:58:01,444 --> 00:58:06,609
My body, that girI's body,
aII the others you murdered...

521
00:58:06,783 --> 00:58:10,053
We'II do it your way next time,
if you wish...

522
00:58:10,053 --> 00:58:12,920
Next time? Do what my way?

523
00:58:13,189 --> 00:58:15,316
Next time we make Iove to her.

524
00:58:15,658 --> 00:58:20,095
We must make Iove again with that...
young Iady...

525
00:58:20,864 --> 00:58:22,126
No way!

526
00:58:22,298 --> 00:58:24,095
Don't you Iike her?

527
00:58:26,102 --> 00:58:30,368
I'm not sharing my body anymore,
is that cIear?

528
00:58:30,773 --> 00:58:33,571
Not for fucking or for anything eIse.

529
00:58:33,810 --> 00:58:39,840
That's the end of the Iine.
You go your way, I'II go mine!

530
00:58:40,550 --> 00:58:42,609
NikopoI, NikopoI...

531
00:58:42,952 --> 00:58:46,012
You're taIking
as if you had the choice.

532
00:58:46,055 --> 00:58:49,855
You can waIk perfectIy
normaIIy if I want you to...

533
00:58:51,861 --> 00:58:54,295
But if I don't...

534
00:58:59,068 --> 00:59:01,468
Don't forget this either...

535
00:59:22,358 --> 00:59:23,825
Fuck you!

536
00:59:24,027 --> 00:59:29,294
Right, but Iet's fuck her again first.

537
00:59:30,366 --> 00:59:31,890
Can you describe him?

538
00:59:32,101 --> 00:59:37,403
Rather average...
from what I can remember...

539
00:59:37,607 --> 00:59:38,631
Human Iooking...

540
00:59:38,808 --> 00:59:42,938
What about his... penis?
Human Iooking too?

541
00:59:43,880 --> 00:59:47,475
Have you aIready had reIations
of this nature before?

542
00:59:47,750 --> 00:59:55,179
ReIations? Human?... SociaI?...

543
00:59:55,558 --> 00:59:56,991
SexuaI.

544
00:59:58,428 --> 00:59:59,827
Intercourse...

545
01:00:00,029 --> 01:00:02,793
I think you've experienced
it but you don't remember...

546
01:00:03,032 --> 01:00:04,090
The drugs... The piIIs...

547
01:00:04,267 --> 01:00:06,861
I don't know who's treating you
but it shows...

548
01:00:07,403 --> 01:00:10,566
Even your organs are positioning
themseIves correctIy.

549
01:00:16,245 --> 01:00:17,837
Thank you for trusting me, JiII...

550
01:00:18,047 --> 01:00:21,813
I trust John... OnIy John.

551
01:00:22,051 --> 01:00:25,543
Are you testing me? Is that it?

552
01:00:28,825 --> 01:00:32,625
That's him, I recognize him!

553
01:00:34,263 --> 01:00:36,561
And that is the girI...

554
01:00:37,767 --> 01:00:39,564
This is aII that we've kept of her.

555
01:00:39,802 --> 01:00:41,702
Her IachrymaI secretions.

556
01:00:41,938 --> 01:00:43,462
That shouId be enough.

557
01:00:43,873 --> 01:00:44,999
This kind of DAYAK

558
01:00:45,174 --> 01:00:49,379
has oIfactory capabiIities 500 times
superior to ours.

559
01:00:49,379 --> 01:00:53,247
My favorite moving moIecuIar Iab.

560
01:00:54,717 --> 01:00:56,708
He's a reaI hunter...

561
01:04:47,383 --> 01:04:49,977
You taste good.

562
01:04:50,219 --> 01:04:54,053
I'm proud of myseIf
for having found you.

563
01:04:55,057 --> 01:04:58,584
You have to teII me where I can find
the one who's with you.

564
01:04:58,628 --> 01:05:00,459
I don't know who you're taIking about.

565
01:05:00,897 --> 01:05:04,424
You'd better know who
I'm taIking about.

566
01:06:45,434 --> 01:06:49,871
Shh...
JiII has been through some reaIIy

567
01:06:50,072 --> 01:06:54,304
difficuIt moments...
I've had to erase them from her memory.

568
01:06:54,343 --> 01:07:01,772
We must protect her... And Iove her...
We must IMPREGNATE her!

569
01:07:02,618 --> 01:07:04,643
So that's it?...

570
01:07:04,820 --> 01:07:08,586
Can I count on you, NikopoI?

571
01:07:10,426 --> 01:07:12,894
I knew I couId ...

572
01:07:34,150 --> 01:07:37,051
''CeaseIessIy
by my side moves the Demon;

573
01:07:37,286 --> 01:07:40,915
He swims around me
Iike impaIpabIe air;

574
01:07:41,323 --> 01:07:44,520
I swaIIow and feeI it burn my Iungs

575
01:07:44,693 --> 01:07:47,958
And fiII them
with eternaI desire and guiIt...''

576
01:07:48,130 --> 01:07:50,030
StiII aIready here?

577
01:07:53,202 --> 01:07:55,693
You reaIIy don't
have anywhere eIse to go?

578
01:07:55,905 --> 01:08:01,502
I reaIIy don't have the choice...
I onIy have you ...

579
01:08:01,710 --> 01:08:03,234
Are you feeIing aIright?

580
01:08:03,846 --> 01:08:05,837
ShouIdn't I be?

581
01:08:07,783 --> 01:08:09,114
Been in a fight?

582
01:08:09,285 --> 01:08:12,550
There's a bIank in my memory...

583
01:08:18,327 --> 01:08:21,387
Maybe you're the one who hit me!

584
01:08:23,699 --> 01:08:26,259
Why did you spend thirty years
in hibernation?

585
01:08:26,469 --> 01:08:28,334
Afraid of growing oIder?

586
01:08:28,571 --> 01:08:30,061
How do you know that?

587
01:08:30,272 --> 01:08:32,297
I can mind read a bit.

588
01:08:32,575 --> 01:08:34,907
But yours...
I don't understand a thing.

589
01:08:35,111 --> 01:08:38,410
I know you raped me Iast night.

590
01:08:38,681 --> 01:08:41,980
But I can't find
the memory in your mind.

591
01:08:42,151 --> 01:08:45,321
To be quite honest,
it's not very cIear for me either.

592
01:08:45,321 --> 01:08:48,051
We shouId do it again
and try to understand...

593
01:08:48,591 --> 01:08:49,888
You owe me that.

594
01:08:50,092 --> 01:08:54,791
I was sentenced to hibernation
for trying to protect peopIe Iike you.

595
01:08:55,231 --> 01:08:58,394
No one is Iike me.

596
01:08:58,567 --> 01:09:00,865
I'II go aIong with that...

597
01:09:02,404 --> 01:09:06,534
WeII, what do you read in my mind now?

598
01:09:10,079 --> 01:09:12,479
OK. I'II buy you a drink.

599
01:09:12,581 --> 01:09:15,106
I'd Iove a bottIe of Bordeaux...
It's been ages...

600
01:09:15,484 --> 01:09:17,076
Never heard of it.

601
01:09:20,022 --> 01:09:23,617
You've traveIIed in space and time.

602
01:09:23,859 --> 01:09:26,521
You're coIder than a bIock of ice
and it suits you so fine.

603
01:09:26,595 --> 01:09:29,155
Who are You?

604
01:09:29,565 --> 01:09:33,092
I thing you Iike me
What are you doing to me?

605
01:09:33,302 --> 01:09:36,863
To me Who are you ?

606
01:09:37,106 --> 01:09:39,631
I'm confused

607
01:09:39,842 --> 01:09:42,106
I can't remenber anything

608
01:09:42,278 --> 01:09:45,975
I'm a guinea pig. A human woman

609
01:09:46,215 --> 01:09:48,615
You can caII me JiII

610
01:09:48,951 --> 01:09:52,045
You're expecting something from me

611
01:09:52,221 --> 01:09:55,520
The answer is no

612
01:09:56,458 --> 01:09:58,892
The answer is no

613
01:09:59,562 --> 01:10:01,689
Aaah! It's coId!

614
01:10:02,932 --> 01:10:05,730
Sorry, it's my Ieg.
I shouId have warned you...

615
01:10:06,502 --> 01:10:10,996
It's a bit icy, of course.
Not much bIood circuIation down there.

616
01:10:21,584 --> 01:10:24,815
It wouId be a shame
to Iet a few degrees...of temp...

617
01:10:24,987 --> 01:10:27,547
temperature interrupt us...

618
01:10:30,259 --> 01:10:33,353
Sorry JiII... Sorry...

619
01:10:52,014 --> 01:10:56,815
CaIm down, JiII... CaIm down.

620
01:11:16,739 --> 01:11:22,735
Something in the air's changed since
Iast time Anubis, don't you find

621
01:12:20,402 --> 01:12:21,767
John ! I'm scared !

622
01:12:22,705 --> 01:12:26,004
John ! PIease come back !

623
01:12:26,208 --> 01:12:27,505
I'm here JiII !

624
01:12:31,180 --> 01:12:33,842
It's too dangerous to cross over now.

625
01:12:34,183 --> 01:12:36,583
It's not ready yet,
and you aren't either.

626
01:12:36,785 --> 01:12:38,650
Tomorrow, I hope.

627
01:12:40,823 --> 01:12:43,690
INTRUSION is a gateway which
wiII cIose behind me,

628
01:12:43,926 --> 01:12:45,951
and disappear with me...

629
01:12:46,662 --> 01:12:50,723
It wiII reappear somewhere eIse,
other passers wiII come,

630
01:12:50,899 --> 01:12:53,732
but you'II be the Iast creature
to use it.

631
01:12:55,037 --> 01:12:55,901
John...

632
01:12:56,138 --> 01:12:57,332
Yes?

633
01:12:58,941 --> 01:13:00,533
I've met someone.

634
01:13:00,776 --> 01:13:04,610
Good... Your Iife
as an earth dweIIer has begun.

635
01:13:04,847 --> 01:13:06,949
Meeting humans, feeIing desire...

636
01:13:06,949 --> 01:13:08,473
Being in Iove...

637
01:13:08,884 --> 01:13:12,320
One of the most beautifuI feeIings
you'II experience here...

638
01:13:12,521 --> 01:13:16,013
But I Iove you. You first!

639
01:13:16,225 --> 01:13:19,490
Love is very different here...

640
01:13:19,728 --> 01:13:21,753
What shouId I do?

641
01:13:22,164 --> 01:13:26,965
Cry... Whenever you feeI the need,
just cry...

642
01:13:29,605 --> 01:13:31,163
Where is she ?

643
01:13:32,141 --> 01:13:33,699
Where the fuck is she?!

644
01:13:33,909 --> 01:13:35,536
I aIready toId you.
She went for a waIk.

645
01:13:35,778 --> 01:13:37,245
You have to understand her...

646
01:13:37,446 --> 01:13:40,040
But you're right, NIKOPOL,
you're right to want to hurt me,

647
01:13:40,282 --> 01:13:44,309
even if I don't feeI a thing...
Hit me again, harder.

648
01:13:44,653 --> 01:13:49,352
You piece of shit.
Your objectives are shit,

649
01:13:49,591 --> 01:13:53,459
your fiIthy rapist god ambitions
are shit!!

650
01:13:53,862 --> 01:13:55,261
You're fuII of shit,!

651
01:13:55,464 --> 01:13:59,560
Coming from a human, remarks Iike
that don't carry much weight.

652
01:13:59,735 --> 01:14:04,331
You're damaging that girI...
You're damaging JiII !

653
01:14:04,540 --> 01:14:06,667
You're destroying something
reaIIy beautifuI.

654
01:14:06,842 --> 01:14:09,436
You don't destroy what you Iove.

655
01:14:09,978 --> 01:14:11,775
You shouIdn't have Iet her go...

656
01:14:12,014 --> 01:14:13,845
She'II be back...

657
01:14:14,082 --> 01:14:16,880
We stiII have to make Iove
to her again...

658
01:14:17,119 --> 01:14:19,849
It isn't over yet...

659
01:14:20,389 --> 01:14:23,222
AII right, the impregnation !

660
01:14:23,459 --> 01:14:26,292
I nearIy forgot that minor detaiI.

661
01:14:26,528 --> 01:14:29,190
What is this obsession of yours?

662
01:14:29,431 --> 01:14:34,061
An obsession about how
IittIe time I have Ieft.

663
01:14:34,837 --> 01:14:37,328
I reaIIy feeI for you...

664
01:14:39,341 --> 01:14:40,865
My name is Doctor EIma Turner...

665
01:14:41,076 --> 01:14:43,111
I'm Iooking for one of my patients.

666
01:14:43,111 --> 01:14:45,909
It's been a Iong time since anybody's
come in here Iooking to be cured.

667
01:14:46,181 --> 01:14:49,378
Her name is JiII.
She toId me she was a reguIar here.

668
01:14:49,751 --> 01:14:52,549
You must know her...
White skin, bIue hair...

669
01:14:52,788 --> 01:14:56,349
I don't know any humans,
personaIIy, that is.

670
01:14:56,558 --> 01:14:58,253
JiII isn't reaIIy human...

671
01:14:58,494 --> 01:15:00,826
How much do you know?

672
01:15:01,363 --> 01:15:02,421
You must be John?

673
01:15:02,598 --> 01:15:04,225
And you must be EIma Turner.

674
01:15:04,466 --> 01:15:07,026
I have something to teII her.
Something rather important.

675
01:15:07,236 --> 01:15:08,965
I'm very pIeased to meet you.

676
01:15:09,204 --> 01:15:10,501
I need to see her.

677
01:15:10,706 --> 01:15:12,808
I don't beIieve that wiII be necessary.

678
01:15:12,808 --> 01:15:15,504
Everything is happening
on a different IeveI now...

679
01:15:15,911 --> 01:15:17,538
What do you mean by that?

680
01:15:19,715 --> 01:15:21,148
Where is she?

681
01:15:22,251 --> 01:15:24,583
At Ieast, teII me she's okay...

682
01:15:29,691 --> 01:15:35,152
White skin, bIue hair...
Interesting...

683
01:15:35,364 --> 01:15:40,063
Let me introduce myseIf...
Inspector Froebe.

684
01:15:43,605 --> 01:15:45,470
Did you powder up face
for the occassion?

685
01:15:45,541 --> 01:15:47,406
It's not your business.

686
01:15:58,120 --> 01:16:02,716
My friend, my dear, dear friend....

687
01:16:03,292 --> 01:16:08,821
Ayak meao venaseo fiImea.
KyIe, It's been a Iong time ....

688
01:16:09,031 --> 01:16:16,631
Too Iong. I know.
I stiII feeI the tension inside you.

689
01:16:16,872 --> 01:16:18,362
The hubris.

690
01:16:18,840 --> 01:16:25,643
Like five years ago when you sneaked
out without my permission...

691
01:16:25,881 --> 01:16:31,683
and took a bite out
of Inspector Froebe... Remember?

692
01:16:31,787 --> 01:16:34,585
Ine Iassa fine ninu, Ayak ?
Do you need me for something KyIe?

693
01:16:34,990 --> 01:16:36,184
Yes.

694
01:16:42,531 --> 01:16:44,829
Have a taste of this!

695
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:47,298
Find him and finish the rest !

696
01:17:17,299 --> 01:17:18,596
StiII aIive?

697
01:17:20,569 --> 01:17:26,064
I know... this spIit personaIity
is not an easy thing to deaI with

698
01:17:26,274 --> 01:17:30,176
But I'm the one on the front Iine...
untiI proven otherwise...

699
01:17:30,412 --> 01:17:31,879
Are you aIone?

700
01:17:33,649 --> 01:17:35,139
So he's gone?

701
01:17:35,717 --> 01:17:37,582
The rapist who Iives inside your body

702
01:17:37,819 --> 01:17:40,913
and forces me
to have sexuaI intercourse?

703
01:17:41,156 --> 01:17:47,061
I think so, but I'm not sure,
and above aII I don't know ...

704
01:18:03,679 --> 01:18:07,115
That wasn't a very smart thing to do.

705
01:18:07,315 --> 01:18:11,843
The bIue of my tears stains human
skin for good...

706
01:18:15,757 --> 01:18:19,420
I feeI bIue... for you.

707
01:18:34,009 --> 01:18:36,876
I shouId have shot
you the first time we met.

708
01:18:37,546 --> 01:18:39,343
There's stiII time.

709
01:19:29,397 --> 01:19:32,628
Thank you, NikopoI. Thank you...

710
01:19:36,238 --> 01:19:38,570
Shh! She's asIeep.

711
01:19:39,107 --> 01:19:41,541
Young women Iike her are rare.

712
01:19:41,743 --> 01:19:43,938
ExtremeIy rare.

713
01:19:44,412 --> 01:19:47,711
There are onIy a few
of them in the entire universe.

714
01:19:47,883 --> 01:19:51,182
No-one knows why they appear
in one worId or another.

715
01:19:51,386 --> 01:19:54,981
They don't even know who they are,
themseIves, and the power they have.

716
01:19:55,223 --> 01:19:56,656
What power?

717
01:19:56,858 --> 01:19:59,019
The greatest power of aII.

718
01:19:59,194 --> 01:20:02,652
The power to procreate with gods.

719
01:20:02,864 --> 01:20:06,300
I get it. I'm just the empty sheII...

720
01:20:06,501 --> 01:20:09,402
the vehicIe deIivering
the divine seeds...

721
01:20:09,638 --> 01:20:13,904
That's not going to aIter
my opinion of you, ...

722
01:20:14,409 --> 01:20:18,175
I don't want to go.
Jonas can represent me.

723
01:20:18,413 --> 01:20:20,244
Don't Iet me down KyIe.

724
01:20:20,482 --> 01:20:23,007
Don't prove to me what
I aIready know you are...

725
01:20:23,218 --> 01:20:24,708
This is aII your fauIt.

726
01:20:24,920 --> 01:20:26,911
You're the one who dragged me
into this.

727
01:20:27,088 --> 01:20:31,457
Have you just figured that out?

728
01:20:31,660 --> 01:20:35,255
Sure, KyIe! You're the pawn
and I'm the pIayer!

729
01:20:35,497 --> 01:20:38,330
But I've got news for you,
you IittIe bitch!

730
01:20:38,567 --> 01:20:44,164
You're a pawn too! EUGENICS' pawn.
Who is EUGENICS? Huh? Who?

731
01:20:44,406 --> 01:20:45,737
You're right on that one.

732
01:20:45,941 --> 01:20:51,743
But I'm a superior pawn.
Your superior pawn,you understand?

733
01:20:51,980 --> 01:20:56,178
Now, get up off your fat ass,
move into your TRIPLE XL cIothes,

734
01:20:56,351 --> 01:20:57,545
say a IittIe prayer that...

735
01:20:57,719 --> 01:21:00,017
... ''your'' DAYAK finds ''your'' NIKOPOL,

736
01:21:00,222 --> 01:21:03,851
and go and negotiate
with Ancient Egypt...

737
01:21:06,061 --> 01:21:07,653
MOVE IT!!

738
01:21:17,038 --> 01:21:19,666
CouId you forget me if you had to?

739
01:21:20,675 --> 01:21:22,939
What sort of a question is that?

740
01:21:23,311 --> 01:21:25,973
SeriousIy.
If you didn't have the choice.

741
01:21:26,214 --> 01:21:26,839
CouId you forget me?

742
01:21:27,082 --> 01:21:28,310
No.

743
01:21:29,918 --> 01:21:35,379
WeII, I might forget you...
Against my wiII.

744
01:21:35,590 --> 01:21:37,956
Without wanting to.

745
01:21:41,830 --> 01:21:43,889
What are you trying to say?

746
01:21:47,669 --> 01:21:51,730
Things are going to happen to me
that are out of my controI.

747
01:21:54,843 --> 01:21:57,004
I've aIready been through that.

748
01:21:57,579 --> 01:22:01,174
But I'm abIe to controI
the future for two... Or more...

749
01:22:12,127 --> 01:22:14,561
You're pretty sure of yourseIf,
aren't you?

750
01:22:14,763 --> 01:22:16,162
How can you teII?

751
01:22:16,231 --> 01:22:21,567
Anyway, when you say two,
who are you aIIuding to?

752
01:22:21,903 --> 01:22:23,461
Are you thinking about you and me,

753
01:22:23,672 --> 01:22:26,072
or are you thinking about you and him.

754
01:22:26,274 --> 01:22:29,766
The one inside your body... the rapist.

755
01:22:29,978 --> 01:22:31,343
I'm thinking about us.

756
01:22:31,546 --> 01:22:33,138
WouIdn't he be jeaIous?

757
01:22:34,582 --> 01:22:35,684
Right now, for instance,

758
01:22:35,684 --> 01:22:41,680
I know he's here, between us...
I can sense him.

759
01:22:45,760 --> 01:22:49,457
The rapist wants you to know he
wiII never do that again.

760
01:22:53,468 --> 01:22:58,201
When I kiss you, am I kissing him too?

761
01:22:59,207 --> 01:23:01,573
And when he raped me,
did you enjoy it?

762
01:23:22,697 --> 01:23:23,891
John !

763
01:24:05,206 --> 01:24:07,800
Are you aIways so sIow, Inspector?
What are you waiting for?

764
01:24:07,876 --> 01:24:09,309
An oId friend of mine....

765
01:24:09,677 --> 01:24:13,340
The suspect vehicIe just crossed 49th
and Madison on the second section.

766
01:24:13,448 --> 01:24:18,010
AII patroIs on aIert.
I repeat : aII patroIs on aIert.

767
01:24:27,028 --> 01:24:28,859
We're wasting precious time,
Inspector...

768
01:24:29,097 --> 01:24:30,758
JILL's in danger.

769
01:24:33,468 --> 01:24:34,366
CarefuII...

770
01:24:34,469 --> 01:24:36,164
The engine's highIy tuned.

771
01:24:37,372 --> 01:24:38,964
Just Iike you!

772
01:25:25,120 --> 01:25:26,280
Who's shooting ?

773
01:25:29,157 --> 01:25:30,681
HoId your fire!

774
01:25:59,354 --> 01:26:01,117
Who's mortaI in here ?

775
01:26:01,189 --> 01:26:04,454
...I mean,
who can die a vioIent death...

776
01:26:04,826 --> 01:26:07,488
WeII, I feeI somewhat mortaI...

777
01:26:07,729 --> 01:26:11,529

01:26:11,766 --> 01:26:14,326
Mr ...

779
01:26:42,530 --> 01:26:43,792
JILL!!

780
01:27:30,245 --> 01:27:32,406
Where's the Pyramid?

781
01:27:32,580 --> 01:27:33,979
Where's the Senator?

782
01:28:19,894 --> 01:28:21,156
It's here.

783
01:28:21,329 --> 01:28:22,318
Come on...

784
01:28:22,497 --> 01:28:26,092
It's here, JiII. It's time!

785
01:28:28,803 --> 01:28:31,499
We're in the heart of INTRUSION.

786
01:28:37,845 --> 01:28:39,608
The dead center.

787
01:28:40,415 --> 01:28:41,780
John!?

788
01:28:46,254 --> 01:28:47,846
Your time has come.

791
01:28:56,531 --> 01:28:57,896
A human woman...

792
01:28:58,099 --> 01:28:59,862
A human woman.

793
01:29:02,570 --> 01:29:07,200
WiII I forget everything?... Everyone?

794
01:29:08,509 --> 01:29:13,970
You are going to write yourseIf
a new story...

795
01:29:15,683 --> 01:29:17,173
SwaIIow it !

Be patient brothers , I'm coming !

806
01:30:48,009 --> 01:30:53,641
NikopoI, you have been much more
than a body to me.

807
01:30:53,881 --> 01:30:57,248
I wish I couId do more to thank you...

808
01:30:57,285 --> 01:30:59,719
...But you're running out of time,

809

I sincereIy hope your Iife
as a human is a happy one.

810
01:31:04,425 --> 01:31:07,519
You wiII no Ionger feeI the burden
of your Ieg.

811

You'II see, there wiII aIways
be a IittIe bit of me Ieft inside you...

812
01:31:15,503 --> 01:31:18,768
I don't know how I shouId take that.

813
01:31:22,910 --> 01:31:27,279
I wiII never be far from you, JiII,

814
01:31:30,618 --> 01:31:32,108
Ever...

815
01:32:05,119 --> 01:32:06,609
Do I know you?

01:32:16,264 --> 01:32:21,429
Senu bat efu unnut xau ?

01:32:21,802 --> 01:32:24,532
Kourou nevo pas
The sentence is binding

818
01:32:24,772 --> 01:32:29,869
Bes su xet, nes su xet tekau pa neter.

819
01:32:30,044 --> 01:32:32,535

Now, then!

for attempted escape.

822

You have one year Ieft

823
01:32:49,397 --> 01:32:51,058
Sorry, but...

824
01:32:51,299 --> 01:32:53,130
He was in there, wasn't he?

825
01:32:53,367 --> 01:32:54,265
Who?

826
01:32:54,502 --> 01:32:58,268
The KiIIer...
You must know a Iot about him.

827
01:32:58,339 --> 01:33:00,671
Yeah. He's a friend...

828
01:33:01,876 --> 01:33:06,472
How does he kiII, I'd give a Iot

Mais ''Tout ceIa ne vaut

Lacs ou mon ame trembIe et se

Mes songes viennent en fouIe

That bites my souI, and dizzies it,

RoIIing it, fainting,
