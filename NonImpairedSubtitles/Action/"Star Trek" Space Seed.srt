1
00:00:20,443 --> 00:00:21,375
Captain.

2
00:00:21,444 --> 00:00:22,877
What is it, Webb?

3
00:00:22,946 --> 00:00:25,380
A blip, sir.Just
came on the screen.

4
00:00:25,448 --> 00:00:26,881
How do you read it?

5
00:00:26,950 --> 00:00:28,383
Aircraft of some sort.

6
00:00:28,451 --> 00:00:30,385
By the size and speed,

7
00:00:30,453 --> 00:00:32,387
it's not
one of ours.

8
00:00:32,455 --> 00:00:34,889
It doesn't read like
anything I've ever seen.

9
00:00:34,958 --> 00:00:36,391
What was the approach?

10
00:00:36,459 --> 00:00:39,895
None, sir. It's just like
it fell out of the sky.

11
00:00:39,963 --> 00:00:41,157
Current position?

12
00:00:41,231 --> 00:00:43,392
Directly over the Omaha
installation. Holding there.

13
00:00:43,466 --> 00:00:44,899
Watch the scope, Webb.

14
00:00:44,968 --> 00:00:47,903
Air Defense will send
somebody up for a closer look.

15
00:00:47,971 --> 00:00:50,906
We may have a real
U.F.O. on our hands.

16
00:00:50,974 --> 00:00:52,498
[Alarm Blares]

17
00:01:23,740 --> 00:01:26,470
Space--
The final frontier.

18
00:01:28,111 --> 00:01:31,547
These are the voyages
of the Starship Enterprise.

19
00:01:31,615 --> 00:01:33,048
Its five-year mission--

20
00:01:33,116 --> 00:01:36,677
to explore
strange new worlds...

21
00:01:36,753 --> 00:01:39,745
to seek out new life
and new civilizations...

22
00:01:39,823 --> 00:01:44,226
to boldly go where
no man has gone before.

23
00:02:16,159 --> 00:02:20,095
Captain 's log--
Stardate 3113.2.

24
00:02:20,163 --> 00:02:22,859
We were enroute to
Starbase 9 for resupply

25
00:02:22,932 --> 00:02:25,867
when a black star of
high-gravitational attraction

26
00:02:25,935 --> 00:02:28,563
began to drag us
toward it.

27
00:02:28,638 --> 00:02:31,072
It required all
warp power in reverse

28
00:02:31,141 --> 00:02:33,575
to pull us away
from the star.

29
00:02:33,643 --> 00:02:35,372
But, like
snapping a rubber band,

30
00:02:35,445 --> 00:02:37,879
the break away sent us
plunging through space,

31
00:02:37,947 --> 00:02:41,110
out of control,
to stop here...

32
00:02:41,184 --> 00:02:42,879
wherever we are.

33
00:02:44,954 --> 00:02:46,216
Mr. Spock.

34
00:02:46,289 --> 00:02:48,553
Except for secondary systems,
everything is out, sir.

35
00:02:48,625 --> 00:02:50,559
We're on
impulse power only.

36
00:02:50,627 --> 00:02:52,857
Auxiliaries?

37
00:02:52,929 --> 00:02:55,864
If Mr. Scott
is still with us,

38
00:02:55,932 --> 00:02:57,866
auxiliaries should
be on momentarily.

39
00:02:57,934 --> 00:03:00,061
Are you all right,
Lieutenant?

40
00:03:06,543 --> 00:03:08,977
Mr. Scott
is still with us.

41
00:03:13,149 --> 00:03:14,480
This is the captain.

42
00:03:14,551 --> 00:03:17,452
Damage control parties
on all decks, check in.

43
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:21,012
All departments, tie-in
with the record computer.

44
00:03:21,091 --> 00:03:22,991
Report casualties

45
00:03:23,059 --> 00:03:25,755
and operational readiness
to the First Officer.

46
00:03:25,829 --> 00:03:27,763
Kirk out.

47
00:03:27,831 --> 00:03:29,492
Lieutenant Uhura,

48
00:03:29,566 --> 00:03:31,500
contact
Starfleet Control.

49
00:03:31,568 --> 00:03:35,004
I want them alerted to the position
of that black star

50
00:03:35,071 --> 00:03:37,699
that's in the area
of Starbase 9.

51
00:03:37,774 --> 00:03:39,708
Captain.

52
00:03:39,776 --> 00:03:42,006
Casualty reports indicate
only minor injuries.

53
00:03:42,078 --> 00:03:45,172
Engineering reports
warp engines nonoperational.

54
00:03:45,248 --> 00:03:47,682
Mr. Scott overrode
the automatic helm setting.

55
00:03:47,751 --> 00:03:50,015
He's holding us in orbit
on impulse power.

56
00:03:50,086 --> 00:03:51,075
Orbit where?

57
00:03:51,154 --> 00:03:52,416
Earth, Captain.

58
00:03:52,489 --> 00:03:54,923
We were on a course
in this direction

59
00:03:54,991 --> 00:03:57,425
when we were pulled
in by the star.

60
00:03:57,494 --> 00:04:00,327
The breakaway threw us
on in the same direction.

61
00:04:01,498 --> 00:04:03,159
Screen on.

62
00:04:07,537 --> 00:04:10,631
We're too low in the atmosphere
to retain this orbit.

63
00:04:10,707 --> 00:04:13,141
Engineering reports we have
sufficient impulse power

64
00:04:13,209 --> 00:04:14,642
to achieve
escape velocity.

65
00:04:14,711 --> 00:04:16,406
Give us some
altitude, Sulu.

66
00:04:16,479 --> 00:04:17,912
Yes, sir.

67
00:04:17,981 --> 00:04:19,414
Helm answering.

68
00:04:19,482 --> 00:04:21,245
She's sluggish, sir.

69
00:04:21,317 --> 00:04:23,148
Captain,

70
00:04:23,219 --> 00:04:25,653
normal Starfleet channel
has nothing but static.

71
00:04:25,722 --> 00:04:28,156
I'm getting something
on another frequency,

72
00:04:28,224 --> 00:04:29,657
but it's not Starfleet.

73
00:04:29,726 --> 00:04:31,159
Put it on audio.

74
00:04:31,227 --> 00:04:33,661
[Newscaster] This is
the 5.:30 news summary.

75
00:04:33,730 --> 00:04:36,790
Cape Kennedy--the first
manned Moon shot

76
00:04:36,866 --> 00:04:40,063
is scheduledfor Wednesday,
6A.M., Eastern Standard Time.

77
00:04:40,136 --> 00:04:42,570
All three astronauts who are
making this historic--

78
00:04:45,074 --> 00:04:47,668
Manned Moon shot?

79
00:04:47,744 --> 00:04:50,508
That was in
the late 1960s.

80
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:53,378
Apparently, Captain,
so are we.

81
00:04:58,087 --> 00:04:59,679
What?

82
00:04:59,756 --> 00:05:03,021
Whiplash propelled us into
a time warp, Captain--backward.

83
00:05:03,092 --> 00:05:05,856
Exact chronometer readings
in a few moments.

84
00:05:05,929 --> 00:05:11,162
Captain, I'm getting
ground-to-air transmission.

85
00:05:12,535 --> 00:05:14,162
Verified.

86
00:05:14,237 --> 00:05:16,671
Scanners report some type
of craft approaching from below,

87
00:05:16,739 --> 00:05:18,604
under cloud cover
and closing.

88
00:05:22,545 --> 00:05:24,979
[Ground Control]
Bluejay 4, this is Blackjack.

89
00:05:25,048 --> 00:05:26,982
We're tracking you
and the U.F. O.

90
00:05:27,050 --> 00:05:29,951
I have him on
my screen. Following.

91
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:33,486
Mr. Sulu, can you gain
altitude faster?

92
00:05:33,556 --> 00:05:35,490
I want to
outdistance him.

93
00:05:35,558 --> 00:05:38,891
Picking up, sir.
She's still slow in responding.

94
00:05:42,499 --> 00:05:44,433
Blackjack,
this is Bluejay 4.

95
00:05:44,501 --> 00:05:47,436
U.F.O. is picking up speed
and climbing.

96
00:05:47,504 --> 00:05:49,096
I'm going in closer.

97
00:05:53,476 --> 00:05:57,105
Bluejay 4, you should be
close enough for visual contact.

98
00:06:02,385 --> 00:06:04,319
I can see it now.

99
00:06:04,387 --> 00:06:06,252
Whatever this is,
it's big.

100
00:06:06,322 --> 00:06:08,756
Two cylindrical
projections on top,

101
00:06:08,825 --> 00:06:10,725
one below.

102
00:06:10,793 --> 00:06:12,090
Purpose--undetermined.

103
00:06:12,161 --> 00:06:14,721
We have two flights
scrambled andon the way.

104
00:06:14,797 --> 00:06:17,732
They should rendezvous
in your sector in two minutes.

105
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:20,291
It won't be here.
The U.F.O.'s climbing away.

106
00:06:23,072 --> 00:06:25,506
[Ground Control] Bluejay 4,
you're ordered to close

107
00:06:25,575 --> 00:06:28,009
and attempt to force
the U.F. O. to land.

108
00:06:28,077 --> 00:06:30,011
We want it brought down

109
00:06:30,079 --> 00:06:32,513
or disabled until
the other planes arrive.

110
00:06:32,582 --> 00:06:34,516
[Pilot] Acknowledged.
Closing on target.

111
00:06:34,584 --> 00:06:36,017
Positive identification,
Captain.

112
00:06:36,085 --> 00:06:37,985
Aircraft is an interceptor,

113
00:06:38,054 --> 00:06:41,888
equipped with missiles, possibly
armed with nuclear warheads.

114
00:06:41,958 --> 00:06:45,894
If he hits us with one,
he might damage us severely,

115
00:06:45,962 --> 00:06:48,897
perhaps beyond our capacity
to repair under current circumstances.

116
00:06:48,965 --> 00:06:50,728
Scotty,

117
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:52,700
Activate tractor beam.

118
00:06:52,769 --> 00:06:55,704
Lock onto that aircraft
and hold it out there.

119
00:06:55,772 --> 00:06:57,706
Captain, this
type of aircraft

120
00:06:57,774 --> 00:06:59,969
might be too fragile
for our tractor beam.

121
00:07:00,043 --> 00:07:01,237
[Scotty] Tractor beam on.

122
00:07:01,311 --> 00:07:03,609
We have the target.

123
00:07:09,152 --> 00:07:11,586
Aircraft is
breaking up, Captain.

124
00:07:11,654 --> 00:07:14,782
Transporter room.

125
00:07:14,857 --> 00:07:17,792
Can you lock onto the
cockpit of that aircraft?

126
00:07:17,860 --> 00:07:19,327
Scanning area, sir.

127
00:07:21,464 --> 00:07:23,398
Try and beam
that pilot aboard.

128
00:07:23,466 --> 00:07:24,933
Take over, Mr. Spock.

129
00:07:43,052 --> 00:07:44,815
Welcome aboard
the Enterprise.

130
00:07:55,064 --> 00:07:56,827
You speak English.

131
00:07:56,899 --> 00:07:58,332
That's right.

132
00:07:58,401 --> 00:08:00,835
You can step off
the transporter, uh--

133
00:08:00,903 --> 00:08:03,303
Captain John Christopher,
United States Air Force.

134
00:08:03,373 --> 00:08:06,035
Serial number 4857932.

135
00:08:06,109 --> 00:08:08,475
Relax, Captain,
you're among friends.

136
00:08:13,916 --> 00:08:16,384
I'm Captain
James T. Kirk.

137
00:08:19,022 --> 00:08:20,819
What's going on here?

138
00:08:20,890 --> 00:08:22,448
Where am I?

139
00:08:22,525 --> 00:08:24,459
What happened?

140
00:08:24,527 --> 00:08:26,961
You people--
who are you?

141
00:08:27,030 --> 00:08:30,227
All in good time,
Captain.

142
00:08:30,299 --> 00:08:31,732
Meanwhile...

143
00:08:31,801 --> 00:08:35,134
Let me apologize for bringing you
aboard this ship so abruptly.

144
00:08:35,204 --> 00:08:36,330
It couldn't be helped.

145
00:08:36,406 --> 00:08:38,340
I didn't know your craft

146
00:08:38,408 --> 00:08:39,841
couldn't take
our tractor beam--

147
00:08:39,909 --> 00:08:42,571
Just tell me
who you are.

148
00:08:42,645 --> 00:08:46,206
We'll tell you what
we decide to tell you shortly.

149
00:08:46,282 --> 00:08:48,182
For now, relax.
You're our guest.

150
00:08:48,251 --> 00:08:49,684
You'll find it interesting.

151
00:08:49,752 --> 00:08:51,276
Bridge to Captain Kirk.

152
00:08:51,354 --> 00:08:53,288
What is it, Mr. Spock?

153
00:08:53,356 --> 00:08:55,790
The aircraft has
completely broken up.

154
00:08:55,858 --> 00:08:58,486
Shall we turn off
the tractor beam?

155
00:08:58,561 --> 00:09:00,495
Affirmative. We
have the pilot aboard.

156
00:09:00,563 --> 00:09:02,428
I'll be right up.
Kirk out.

157
00:09:02,498 --> 00:09:03,692
Follow me.

158
00:09:20,316 --> 00:09:21,749
Good morning,
Captain.

159
00:09:21,818 --> 00:09:24,252
Good morning.
Captain.

160
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:25,252
A woman?

161
00:09:25,321 --> 00:09:27,186
Crewman.

162
00:09:32,829 --> 00:09:33,989
Bridge.

163
00:09:37,333 --> 00:09:39,267
Must have
taken quite a lot

164
00:09:39,335 --> 00:09:41,269
to build a ship
like this.

165
00:09:41,337 --> 00:09:44,272
There are only 12 like it
in the fleet.

166
00:09:44,340 --> 00:09:45,773
I see.

167
00:09:45,842 --> 00:09:47,275
Did the Navy--

168
00:09:47,343 --> 00:09:50,278
We're a combined
service, Captain.

169
00:09:50,346 --> 00:09:53,838
Our authority is
the United Earth Space Probe Agency.

170
00:09:53,916 --> 00:09:55,907
United Earth?

171
00:09:55,985 --> 00:09:58,419
This is very
difficult to explain.

172
00:10:00,690 --> 00:10:02,419
We're from your future.

173
00:10:02,492 --> 00:10:05,893
A time warp
placed us here.

174
00:10:07,530 --> 00:10:08,724
It was an accident.

175
00:10:08,798 --> 00:10:11,733
You seem to
have a lot of them.

176
00:10:11,801 --> 00:10:13,234
However...

177
00:10:13,302 --> 00:10:16,533
I can't deny the fact
that you're here,

178
00:10:16,606 --> 00:10:18,233
with this ship.

179
00:10:18,307 --> 00:10:21,208
I never have believed
in little green men.

180
00:10:21,277 --> 00:10:23,745
Neither have I.

181
00:10:23,813 --> 00:10:25,940
Captain Christopher,

182
00:10:26,015 --> 00:10:27,812
this is my
First Officer

183
00:10:27,884 --> 00:10:29,545
Lieutenant Commander Spock.

184
00:10:29,619 --> 00:10:30,847
Captain.

185
00:10:32,889 --> 00:10:34,823
Feel free to
look around, Captain.

186
00:10:34,891 --> 00:10:37,325
Don't touch anything.
You'll find it interesting.

187
00:10:37,393 --> 00:10:41,329
Interesting is a word and a half
for it, Captain.

188
00:10:51,908 --> 00:10:54,843
We've achieved a stable orbit
out of Earth's atmosphere.

189
00:10:54,911 --> 00:10:56,344
Our deflectors
are operative,

190
00:10:56,412 --> 00:11:00,849
enough to prevent our
being picked up again as a U.F.O.

191
00:11:00,917 --> 00:11:03,784
Mr. Scott wishes to speak to you
about the engines.

192
00:11:03,853 --> 00:11:05,787
Very well, Mr. Spock--

193
00:11:08,357 --> 00:11:10,723
Anything else
on your mind?

194
00:11:10,793 --> 00:11:13,227
Captain Christopher.

195
00:11:20,369 --> 00:11:22,303
What about him?

196
00:11:22,371 --> 00:11:25,602
We cannot return him
to Earth, Captain.

197
00:11:25,675 --> 00:11:28,735
He already knows too much about us
and is learning more.

198
00:11:28,811 --> 00:11:31,746
I do not specifically refer
to Captain Christopher,

199
00:11:31,814 --> 00:11:34,544
but suppose
an unscrupulous man

200
00:11:34,617 --> 00:11:36,608
were to gain
certain knowledge

201
00:11:36,686 --> 00:11:38,313
of man's future?

202
00:11:38,387 --> 00:11:41,618
Such a man could manipulate
key industries,

203
00:11:41,691 --> 00:11:43,625
stocks,
and even nations.

204
00:11:43,693 --> 00:11:45,752
And, in so doing,

205
00:11:45,828 --> 00:11:48,296
change what must be.

206
00:11:48,364 --> 00:11:50,798
And if it
is changed, Captain,

207
00:11:50,867 --> 00:11:53,836
you and I, and
all that we know,

208
00:11:53,903 --> 00:11:56,167
might not even exist.

209
00:11:57,640 --> 00:12:00,575
Your logic
can be most...

210
00:12:00,643 --> 00:12:02,770
annoying.

211
00:12:05,848 --> 00:12:08,783
That flight suit
must be uncomfortable.

212
00:12:08,851 --> 00:12:11,285
Why don't you have
the quartermaster

213
00:12:11,354 --> 00:12:13,345
issue him something
more suitable?

214
00:12:13,422 --> 00:12:16,789
Then I want to meet you
and him in my quarters.

215
00:12:16,859 --> 00:12:18,019
Yes, sir.

216
00:12:32,375 --> 00:12:34,309
Computer on. Record.

217
00:12:34,377 --> 00:12:36,311
[Computer] Recording.

218
00:12:36,379 --> 00:12:37,311
[Doorbell Buzzes]

219
00:12:37,380 --> 00:12:38,608
Come.

220
00:12:40,383 --> 00:12:42,317
Captain's log--
supplemental.

221
00:12:42,385 --> 00:12:45,821
Engineering Officer Scott
informs warp engines damaged,

222
00:12:45,888 --> 00:12:48,823
but can be made operational
and re-energized.

223
00:12:48,891 --> 00:12:51,451
[Computer]
Computed and recorded, dear.

224
00:12:53,262 --> 00:12:56,823
Computer, you will not address me
in that manner. Compute.

225
00:12:56,899 --> 00:12:59,299
Computed, dear.

226
00:13:03,239 --> 00:13:05,230
Mr. Spock,

227
00:13:05,308 --> 00:13:08,744
I ordered this computer
and its interlinking systems repaired.

228
00:13:08,811 --> 00:13:11,245
I have investigated
it, Captain.

229
00:13:11,314 --> 00:13:13,179
To correct the fault
will require

230
00:13:13,249 --> 00:13:15,683
an overhaul of the entire
computer system

231
00:13:15,751 --> 00:13:19,187
and a minimum of three weeks
at a starbase.

232
00:13:19,255 --> 00:13:23,191
I wouldn't mind so much
if it didn't get so...

233
00:13:23,259 --> 00:13:24,851
affectionate.

234
00:13:24,927 --> 00:13:28,761
It also has an unfortunate
tendency to giggle.

235
00:13:28,831 --> 00:13:32,392
I take it a lady computer
is not routine.

236
00:13:32,468 --> 00:13:35,528
We'd put in at Signet 14
for general repairs.

237
00:13:35,604 --> 00:13:39,131
Signet 14 is a planet
dominated by women.

238
00:13:39,208 --> 00:13:42,143
They felt the ship's computer system
lacked a personality.

239
00:13:42,211 --> 00:13:43,644
They gave it one.

240
00:13:43,713 --> 00:13:45,374
Female, of course.

241
00:13:45,448 --> 00:13:47,382
Ha ha!
Well, you people

242
00:13:47,450 --> 00:13:49,315
certainly have
interesting problems.

243
00:13:49,385 --> 00:13:51,819
I'd love to
stay around to see

244
00:13:51,887 --> 00:13:53,821
how your girlfriend
works out, but--

245
00:13:53,889 --> 00:13:55,481
I'm afraid you'll have to.

246
00:13:55,558 --> 00:13:57,992
We can't send you back.

247
00:13:58,060 --> 00:13:59,357
Can't?

248
00:14:00,830 --> 00:14:04,129
Spock said that your transporter
can beam down an object,

249
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:06,998
even from
an orbit this high.

250
00:14:07,069 --> 00:14:09,902
It's not the transporter.
It's you.

251
00:14:09,972 --> 00:14:12,406
You know what
the future looks like.

252
00:14:12,475 --> 00:14:14,409
If anybody
else finds out,

253
00:14:14,477 --> 00:14:17,776
they could change
its course, destroy it.

254
00:14:17,847 --> 00:14:20,145
Then my disappearance
would change something, too.

255
00:14:22,318 --> 00:14:25,754
I have run a check
on all historical tapes.

256
00:14:25,821 --> 00:14:30,952
They show no record of any relevant
contribution by John Christopher.

257
00:14:31,027 --> 00:14:35,293
Look, Captain, I don't buy all your
time-accident story.

258
00:14:35,364 --> 00:14:39,357
The experts can figure out
who you are, what you are.

259
00:14:39,435 --> 00:14:42,666
It's my duty to
report what I've seen.

260
00:14:42,738 --> 00:14:43,932
What would you do?

261
00:14:45,374 --> 00:14:47,808
I'd...report,

262
00:14:47,877 --> 00:14:49,811
If I could.

263
00:14:49,879 --> 00:14:52,143
We can't
take the risk.

264
00:14:52,214 --> 00:14:54,648
I don't want to
know about risks.

265
00:14:54,717 --> 00:14:57,345
I have a wife,
two children.

266
00:14:57,420 --> 00:14:58,853
What about them?

267
00:14:58,921 --> 00:15:00,718
I'm sorry.

268
00:15:00,790 --> 00:15:03,224
[Scotty]
Engine room to Captain Kirk.

269
00:15:04,827 --> 00:15:06,761
Kirk here.
What is it, Scotty?

270
00:15:06,829 --> 00:15:08,490
Progress report, sir.

271
00:15:08,564 --> 00:15:11,499
Everything's jerry-rigged, but we're
coming along with the repairs.

272
00:15:11,567 --> 00:15:15,003
We could re-energize in
about four hours, but, uh...

273
00:15:15,071 --> 00:15:17,301
But what, Scotty?

274
00:15:17,373 --> 00:15:19,307
Well, sir, as I say,

275
00:15:19,375 --> 00:15:22,310
the, uh, the engines
are being repaired,

276
00:15:22,378 --> 00:15:25,245
but we've no place
to go in this time.

277
00:15:25,314 --> 00:15:27,680
If you--

278
00:15:27,750 --> 00:15:30,719
If--If you
see what I mean?

279
00:15:32,321 --> 00:15:33,253
Sir?

280
00:15:33,322 --> 00:15:36,883
Yes, Scotty, carry on.

281
00:15:40,196 --> 00:15:41,527
Too bad, Captain.

282
00:15:42,998 --> 00:15:46,161
Maybe I can't go home,
but neither can you.

283
00:15:46,235 --> 00:15:50,171
You're as much a prisoner
in time as I am.

284
00:15:56,345 --> 00:16:01,146
Captain 's Log
Stardate 3113.7.

285
00:16:01,217 --> 00:16:02,616
Our engines
are being repaired,

286
00:16:02,685 --> 00:16:05,051
but we are still
locked in time.

287
00:16:05,121 --> 00:16:08,249
And we have aboard a passenger
whom we do not want,

288
00:16:08,324 --> 00:16:09,757
and we cannot return.

289
00:16:09,825 --> 00:16:12,453
Recommendation for his
disposition, dear.

290
00:16:14,230 --> 00:16:16,130
Maintenance note--

291
00:16:16,198 --> 00:16:19,565
My recording computer
has a serious malfunction.

292
00:16:19,635 --> 00:16:22,103
Recommend it either
be corrected...

293
00:16:22,171 --> 00:16:24,571
or scrapped. Compute.

294
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:27,473
Computed.

295
00:16:27,543 --> 00:16:28,703
[Spock] Bridge
to Captain Kirk.

296
00:16:28,777 --> 00:16:30,711
Kirk, here.

297
00:16:30,779 --> 00:16:34,044
Have some new information
regarding Captain Christopher.

298
00:16:34,116 --> 00:16:35,777
Important I see you
both immediately.

299
00:16:35,851 --> 00:16:37,785
Yes, Mr. Spock.
Report to my quarters.

300
00:16:37,853 --> 00:16:39,548
I'll contact
Captain Christopher.

301
00:16:39,622 --> 00:16:40,782
Yes, sir. Bridge out.

302
00:16:40,856 --> 00:16:41,948
Captain Christopher...

303
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:45,292
Captain Christopher?

304
00:16:47,463 --> 00:16:49,294
Security, this
is the captain.

305
00:16:49,365 --> 00:16:50,525
Security Chief
here, sir.

306
00:16:50,599 --> 00:16:51,861
All decks alert.

307
00:16:51,934 --> 00:16:54,300
Captain Christopher is not
in his assigned quarters.

308
00:16:54,370 --> 00:16:56,304
He may be trying
to escape.

309
00:16:56,372 --> 00:16:58,306
Put a man outside
the transporter room immediately.

310
00:16:58,374 --> 00:16:59,636
I'm heading there myself.

311
00:17:22,231 --> 00:17:24,529
All right!
Nice and easy.

312
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:26,761
Now I'm going to step
into that thing,

313
00:17:26,835 --> 00:17:29,269
and you're going to transport me
back to Earth.

314
00:17:35,177 --> 00:17:38,169
Well, Jim, with the exception of
a slight bruise or two,

315
00:17:38,247 --> 00:17:41,273
our captain is as healthy as
a proverbial horse.

316
00:17:41,350 --> 00:17:43,284
He'll be coming to
in a minute.

317
00:17:43,352 --> 00:17:45,343
He tried to escape.

318
00:17:45,421 --> 00:17:46,786
I know how he feels,

319
00:17:46,855 --> 00:17:50,791
but I can't send him back
with what he knows.

320
00:17:50,859 --> 00:17:54,158
Jim, what if
we can't go back?

321
00:17:54,230 --> 00:17:55,288
What do we do?

322
00:17:55,364 --> 00:17:57,798
Wait up here for our
supplies to run out,

323
00:17:57,866 --> 00:17:59,800
our power to die?
It has to eventually,

324
00:17:59,868 --> 00:18:01,733
and we certainly
can't go back to Earth.

325
00:18:01,804 --> 00:18:04,398
It would be worse
than the Captain being returned.

326
00:18:04,473 --> 00:18:06,373
There are 430 of us.

327
00:18:06,442 --> 00:18:11,175
Now, that means 430 chances of
altering the future.

328
00:18:11,247 --> 00:18:13,738
Yes...

329
00:18:13,816 --> 00:18:16,376
We're not
in that position yet.

330
00:18:16,452 --> 00:18:18,750
I'm glad to hear it.

331
00:18:18,821 --> 00:18:21,255
And if we do get back
to where we belong,

332
00:18:21,323 --> 00:18:22,950
then he won't belong.

333
00:18:23,025 --> 00:18:25,493
We're roughly about
the same age.

334
00:18:25,561 --> 00:18:29,190
But in our society,
he'd be useless.

335
00:18:29,265 --> 00:18:31,256
Archaic.

336
00:18:31,333 --> 00:18:34,234
Maybe he could be
retrained, re-educated.

337
00:18:34,303 --> 00:18:36,601
Now you're sounding
like Spock.

338
00:18:36,672 --> 00:18:40,301
If you're going to get nasty,
I'm going to leave.

339
00:18:40,376 --> 00:18:42,970
Could he be retrained
to forget his family?

340
00:18:43,045 --> 00:18:44,603
His children?

341
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:47,080
The answer
to that is no.

342
00:18:48,183 --> 00:18:49,115
Mmm.

343
00:18:51,687 --> 00:18:53,120
You all right?

344
00:18:53,188 --> 00:18:54,485
Yeah.

345
00:18:54,556 --> 00:18:55,989
I see physical
training

346
00:18:56,058 --> 00:18:57,525
is required in
your service, too.

347
00:18:57,593 --> 00:19:01,893
Mmm. Crude methods,
but effective.

348
00:19:01,964 --> 00:19:03,431
What does he
mean by that?

349
00:19:03,499 --> 00:19:04,932
Just a joke, Captain.

350
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,730
You said you had some additional
information, Mr. Spock?

351
00:19:07,803 --> 00:19:09,293
I made an error
in my computations.

352
00:19:09,371 --> 00:19:13,034
Oh? This could be
an historic occasion.

353
00:19:13,108 --> 00:19:16,703
I find that we must return
Captain Christopher to Earth after all.

354
00:19:16,779 --> 00:19:20,715
Why? You said
I made no relative contribution.

355
00:19:20,783 --> 00:19:23,718
Poor choice of words
on my part.

356
00:19:23,786 --> 00:19:26,084
I neglected, in my
initial run-through,

357
00:19:26,155 --> 00:19:29,488
to correlate the possible
contributions by offspring.

358
00:19:29,558 --> 00:19:33,289
I find, after running
a cross-check on that factor,

359
00:19:33,362 --> 00:19:35,728
that your son
Colonel Sean Jeffrey Christopher

360
00:19:35,798 --> 00:19:40,861
headed, or will head, the first
successful Earth-Saturn probe,

361
00:19:40,936 --> 00:19:42,927
which is
a rather significant--

362
00:19:43,005 --> 00:19:44,939
Wait a minute.
I don't have a son.

363
00:19:47,443 --> 00:19:48,876
You mean, yet.

364
00:19:48,944 --> 00:19:51,742
The doctor is correct.

365
00:19:51,814 --> 00:19:54,044
Unless we return
Captain Christopher to Earth,

366
00:19:54,116 --> 00:19:57,745
There will be no Colonel
Sean Jeffrey Christopher

367
00:19:57,820 --> 00:19:59,185
to go to Saturn.

368
00:19:59,254 --> 00:20:02,951
Well, that's it,
isn't it?

369
00:20:03,025 --> 00:20:05,459
We'll have to find
some way of...

370
00:20:07,629 --> 00:20:09,256
A boy.

371
00:20:10,566 --> 00:20:12,534
I'm going
to have a son.

372
00:20:20,342 --> 00:20:23,277
Acknowledging that
we must return Captain Christopher,

373
00:20:23,345 --> 00:20:25,939
there are
several problems,

374
00:20:26,014 --> 00:20:29,643
prime of which is
the explanation of his return.

375
00:20:29,718 --> 00:20:31,913
We tracked his
plane wreckage down

376
00:20:31,987 --> 00:20:34,421
after our tractor beam
crushed it.

377
00:20:34,490 --> 00:20:36,958
It crashed in an open section
of southern Nebraska.

378
00:20:37,025 --> 00:20:38,959
That means those
search parties

379
00:20:39,027 --> 00:20:40,961
will be crawling
all over that range.

380
00:20:41,029 --> 00:20:43,463
Captain Christopher
himself complicated the matter.

381
00:20:45,467 --> 00:20:47,162
When I made
visual contact,

382
00:20:47,236 --> 00:20:49,170
I turned on
my wing cameras.

383
00:20:49,238 --> 00:20:52,173
I got close enough to take
some pretty clear pictures.

384
00:20:52,241 --> 00:20:53,173
Air Defense Command

385
00:20:53,242 --> 00:20:54,903
will be processing
that film fast.

386
00:20:54,977 --> 00:20:58,071
And A.D.C. Control was
probably recording

387
00:20:58,147 --> 00:20:59,546
my radio transmissions.

388
00:20:59,615 --> 00:21:02,516
If I remember my history,

389
00:21:02,584 --> 00:21:04,518
these things
were being dismissed

390
00:21:04,586 --> 00:21:08,989
as weather balloons,
sundogs, explainable things--

391
00:21:09,057 --> 00:21:10,524
at least publicly.

392
00:21:10,592 --> 00:21:15,655
Captain, our tractor beam caught
and crushed an Air Force plane.

393
00:21:15,731 --> 00:21:18,165
It'll be impossible
to explain this

394
00:21:18,233 --> 00:21:21,168
as anything other
than a genuine U.F.O.

395
00:21:21,236 --> 00:21:22,260
Possibly alien...

396
00:21:22,337 --> 00:21:25,431
definitely destructive.

397
00:21:25,507 --> 00:21:27,634
What about our
problem, Mr. Spock?

398
00:21:27,709 --> 00:21:31,110
Any ideas on how to get us back
to our own time?

399
00:21:34,116 --> 00:21:36,277
A theory...

400
00:21:36,351 --> 00:21:40,515
a reverse application
of what happened to us.

401
00:21:40,589 --> 00:21:43,149
Logically, it could work.

402
00:21:43,225 --> 00:21:45,659
Also, logically, there are
a hundred variables,

403
00:21:45,727 --> 00:21:49,163
any one of which could put
us in a worse position

404
00:21:49,231 --> 00:21:50,664
than we're in now.

405
00:21:53,001 --> 00:21:54,298
We're going to have
to go back

406
00:21:54,369 --> 00:21:57,167
and get those reports
and photos.

407
00:21:57,239 --> 00:22:01,676
If the captain feels duty bound
to report what he saw,

408
00:22:01,743 --> 00:22:03,870
there won't be any
evidence to support him.

409
00:22:03,946 --> 00:22:06,437
That makes me look
like a liar or a fool.

410
00:22:06,515 --> 00:22:08,176
Perhaps.

411
00:22:08,250 --> 00:22:09,478
Not at all.

412
00:22:09,551 --> 00:22:12,111
You'll simply be one
of the thousands

413
00:22:12,187 --> 00:22:13,848
who thought he saw a U.F.O.

414
00:22:13,922 --> 00:22:16,584
Captain,
I know that base.

415
00:22:16,658 --> 00:22:19,525
I was stationed there a year ago.
I'd like to--

416
00:22:19,595 --> 00:22:22,029
No, Captain. Thank you.

417
00:22:22,097 --> 00:22:25,032
But if anything
should go wrong,

418
00:22:25,100 --> 00:22:26,032
you might get hurt.

419
00:22:26,101 --> 00:22:27,466
We couldn't risk that.

420
00:22:27,536 --> 00:22:30,596
Neither could you...
or your son.

421
00:22:30,672 --> 00:22:32,606
Well, I'd like
to help.

422
00:22:32,674 --> 00:22:35,609
I could sketch a layout of
the place for you,

423
00:22:35,677 --> 00:22:38,908
show you where
the record section

424
00:22:38,981 --> 00:22:40,915
and the photo lab are.

425
00:24:53,215 --> 00:24:54,648
Primitive computer.

426
00:24:54,716 --> 00:24:56,650
I've seen them
demonstrated in museums.

427
00:24:56,718 --> 00:24:57,650
Me, too.

428
00:24:57,719 --> 00:24:59,653
If this one's
like those,

429
00:24:59,721 --> 00:25:02,588
it'll make the devil's noise
if you start it.

430
00:25:02,658 --> 00:25:04,922
I don't intend
to start it.

431
00:25:11,166 --> 00:25:14,101
How long have they
been down there now?

432
00:25:14,169 --> 00:25:16,103
15 minutes, 28 seconds.

433
00:25:16,171 --> 00:25:18,799
Well, shouldn't
they be coming up?

434
00:25:18,874 --> 00:25:21,843
It is a fact, Doctor,
that prowling by stealth

435
00:25:21,910 --> 00:25:24,811
is more time-consuming
than a direct approach.

436
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:26,609
In our case--

437
00:25:26,682 --> 00:25:28,877
Shouldn't you
be working on

438
00:25:28,950 --> 00:25:30,918
your time warp
calculations, Mr. Spock?

439
00:25:30,986 --> 00:25:32,317
I am.

440
00:25:42,698 --> 00:25:44,131
Hold it.

441
00:25:44,199 --> 00:25:45,826
Get your hands up.

442
00:25:52,708 --> 00:25:55,677
Now...one
at a time--

443
00:25:55,744 --> 00:25:57,405
Hand me those belts.

444
00:26:04,653 --> 00:26:06,484
And the bag.

445
00:26:14,696 --> 00:26:16,095
It's been too long.

446
00:26:16,164 --> 00:26:19,099
Jim should have
at least signaled by now.

447
00:26:19,167 --> 00:26:20,600
You may be correct, Doctor.

That noise.

453
00:26:30,579 --> 00:26:31,671
I didn't hear
anything.

Stay right where you are.

460
00:26:52,968 --> 00:26:54,401
One emergency signal, sir.

461

What happened?

Spock here.
Are you all right, Captain?

467
00:27:49,524 --> 00:27:52,891
Yes, I'm all right,
but as you can see,

468
00:27:52,961 --> 00:27:55,259
we have...another problem.

recording.

472

Due to an unfortunate
accident,

00:28:12,414 --> 00:28:15,440
we have taken aboard
another unwanted passenger.

474
00:28:21,923 --> 00:28:23,356
Your surprise package

475
00:28:23,425 --> 00:28:26,223
is an air police sergeant
from the base.

476
00:28:26,294 --> 00:28:27,352
Keep him there.

477
00:28:27,429 --> 00:28:30,330
No use in letting him
see more of the ship

478
00:28:30,398 --> 00:28:31,865
than is necessary.

479
00:28:31,933 --> 00:28:35,391
I don't believe there'll be trouble
in that respect, Captain.

480
00:28:40,442 --> 00:28:42,876
Our guest seems
quite satisfied

481
00:28:42,944 --> 00:28:44,605
to remain
where he is.

maybe a little after.

00:28:56,958 --> 00:28:59,893
Put it at the end
of these tapes, will you?

488
00:28:59,961 --> 00:29:01,360
You've got them all.

489
00:29:23,919 --> 00:29:25,045
[Door Opens]

490
00:30:05,961 --> 00:30:08,122
We'll try the darkroom.

491
00:30:23,979 --> 00:30:25,640
Photo lab.

492
00:30:30,285 --> 00:30:31,877
That's...

493
00:30:31,953 --> 00:30:33,545
That's it.

494
00:30:33,621 --> 00:30:35,384
That's all ofthem.

495
00:30:35,457 --> 00:30:38,426
Signal Mr. Spock that we're
almost ready to beam up.

496
00:30:38,493 --> 00:30:41,428
I'll make a check
of the files just in case.

497
00:30:41,496 --> 00:30:43,259
Yes, sir.

498
00:32:01,509 --> 00:32:03,340
All right.
Where's the other one?

499
00:32:03,411 --> 00:32:04,571
What other one?

500
00:32:04,646 --> 00:32:07,615
Your partner.
I saw somebody move in there.

501
00:32:07,682 --> 00:32:09,274
No, no, no.Just me.

502
00:32:09,350 --> 00:32:12,683
Besides, could anyone get out of here
without your seeing them?

503
00:32:16,758 --> 00:32:19,226
No. Nobody should have
been able to.

504
00:32:23,298 --> 00:32:25,892
Your decision to beam up was
quite correct, Mr. Sulu.

505
00:32:25,967 --> 00:32:27,764
Engine room
to Mr. Spock.

506
00:32:28,970 --> 00:32:30,767
Spock here.

507
00:32:30,839 --> 00:32:33,205
We've completedre-energizing
the warp engines, sir.

508
00:32:33,274 --> 00:32:34,901
We can refire them
anytime.

509
00:32:34,976 --> 00:32:36,409
Do so now, engineer.

510
00:32:36,478 --> 00:32:39,413
We'll need all power
to test our theory.

511
00:32:39,481 --> 00:32:41,346
Aye, sir.
Engine room out.

512
00:32:49,491 --> 00:32:50,924
Hmm.

513
00:32:50,992 --> 00:32:52,926
Poor photography.

514
00:32:52,994 --> 00:32:56,430
Blast your theories
and observations, Mr. Spock.

515
00:32:56,498 --> 00:32:59,433
What about Jim? He's down there alone,
probably under arrest.

516
00:32:59,501 --> 00:33:01,435
He doesn't have
a communicator,

517
00:33:01,503 --> 00:33:04,870
and we can't locate him
or beam him back aboard without one.

518
00:33:04,939 --> 00:33:07,237
I am aware of that, Doctor.

519
00:33:10,445 --> 00:33:11,878
This is the first officer.

520
00:33:11,946 --> 00:33:14,847
Captain Christopher
to the briefing room.

521
00:33:14,916 --> 00:33:18,215
Now, look, Mister. You and I
had better start communicating.

522
00:33:18,286 --> 00:33:21,187
I want to know
how you got in here.

523
00:33:21,256 --> 00:33:22,723
That's a simple
question.

524
00:33:22,790 --> 00:33:24,223
Nobody saw you.

525
00:33:24,292 --> 00:33:27,227
You got all the way inside
without tripping any alarm.

526
00:33:27,295 --> 00:33:28,728
How did you do it?

527
00:33:28,796 --> 00:33:30,423
Believe me, Colonel,

528
00:33:30,498 --> 00:33:32,056
you wouldn't
believe me.

529
00:33:32,133 --> 00:33:35,728
Don't try to be funny.
How did you get in?

530
00:33:35,803 --> 00:33:38,738
I popped in
out of thin air.

531
00:33:38,806 --> 00:33:42,242
You seem to think
this is some kind of a game.

532
00:33:42,310 --> 00:33:45,245
No, Colonel.
I know it's no game.

533
00:33:45,313 --> 00:33:48,248
What did you say
your name was?

534
00:33:48,316 --> 00:33:50,250
For the fourth time,

535
00:33:50,318 --> 00:33:52,752
my name is
James T. Kirk.

536
00:33:52,820 --> 00:33:54,754
And how did you
get inside

537
00:33:54,822 --> 00:33:57,757
a top security installation,
James T. Kirk?

538
00:33:57,825 --> 00:34:00,589
I told you you wouldn't
believe me.

539
00:34:10,705 --> 00:34:12,138
Uh...Colonel,

540
00:34:12,207 --> 00:34:14,539
would you mind
being careful with that?

541
00:34:14,609 --> 00:34:16,042
That worries you, huh?

542
00:34:16,110 --> 00:34:18,943
Is that a radio, transmitter
of some kind?

543
00:34:19,013 --> 00:34:20,207
Of some kind.

544
00:34:20,281 --> 00:34:22,715
You can be more specific
than that, Kirk.

545
00:34:22,784 --> 00:34:24,217
I don't like
mysteries.

546
00:34:24,285 --> 00:34:27,220
If you don't stop
being careless with that,

547
00:34:27,288 --> 00:34:29,222
you'll have one--
a big one.

548
00:34:29,290 --> 00:34:31,224
I'll have it
disassembled and examined.

549
00:34:31,292 --> 00:34:32,725
We are not dummies, mister.

550
00:34:32,794 --> 00:34:36,286
We know how to fi nd out things
we want to know.

551
00:34:40,802 --> 00:34:43,737
What is that?

552
00:34:43,805 --> 00:34:47,241
Is that a uniform
of some kind?

553
00:34:47,308 --> 00:34:49,242
This little thing?

554
00:34:49,310 --> 00:34:51,244
Something
I slipped on.

555
00:34:51,312 --> 00:34:54,247
Kirk, maybe you don't realize
how serious this is.

556
00:34:54,315 --> 00:34:56,249
Sabotage of a government
installation--

557
00:34:56,317 --> 00:34:57,750
Did I sabotage
something?

558
00:34:57,819 --> 00:34:59,753
No. We stopped you
in time.

559
00:34:59,821 --> 00:35:03,188
But what would you have done
if we hadn't found you?

560
00:35:03,258 --> 00:35:05,192
Believe me, Colonel,
nothing at all.

561
00:35:05,260 --> 00:35:08,855
Is that what you're here for,
nothing at all?

562
00:35:08,930 --> 00:35:10,591
That's what would
have happened

563
00:35:10,665 --> 00:35:12,155
if you hadn't
interfered.

564
00:35:12,233 --> 00:35:15,669
All right, Kirk.
maybe this will make you laugh--

565
00:35:15,737 --> 00:35:18,205
Sabotage, espionage,
unauthorized entry, burglary!

566
00:35:18,273 --> 00:35:19,706
How are those
for starters?

567
00:35:19,774 --> 00:35:21,708
I can think up
lots more

568
00:35:21,776 --> 00:35:23,209
if you don't
start talking.

569
00:35:23,278 --> 00:35:24,711
All right, Colonel.

570
00:35:24,779 --> 00:35:28,215
The truth is, I'm a little green man
from Alpha Centauri,

571
00:35:28,283 --> 00:35:29,716
a beautiful place.

572
00:35:29,784 --> 00:35:31,217
You ought to see it.

573
00:35:31,286 --> 00:35:35,382
I am going to
lock you up for 200 years.

574
00:35:38,793 --> 00:35:41,785
That ought to be
Just about right.

575
00:35:47,769 --> 00:35:50,237
He's probably being held
in security section.

576
00:35:50,305 --> 00:35:52,239
Even if they've notified
the authorities,

577
00:35:52,307 --> 00:35:55,401
it'll take time
for someone to get there.

578
00:35:55,476 --> 00:35:57,842
Can you give us
the coordinates

579
00:35:57,912 --> 00:36:00,813
to beam down a landing party near
those interrogation rooms?

580
00:36:00,882 --> 00:36:03,783
Yes. But you're not
going to get them

581
00:36:03,851 --> 00:36:06,479
unless you take me
with you.

582
00:36:06,554 --> 00:36:08,317
I can't do that,
Captain.

583
00:36:08,389 --> 00:36:10,152
If something
went wrong--

584
00:36:10,224 --> 00:36:11,987
Something's
already gone wrong.

585
00:36:14,195 --> 00:36:17,187
You could beam down
anywhere inside that base,

586
00:36:17,265 --> 00:36:20,257
but it would take
time to find him.

587
00:36:25,773 --> 00:36:27,934
Mr. Sulu,
you and Captain Christopher

588
00:36:28,009 --> 00:36:30,671
will beam down
with me.

589
00:36:30,745 --> 00:36:32,679
The captain will provide
the coordinates

590
00:36:32,747 --> 00:36:34,271
for the transporter chief.

591
00:36:34,349 --> 00:36:35,646
Shall I issue phasers?

592
00:36:35,717 --> 00:36:37,548
One for you,
one for me,

593
00:36:37,618 --> 00:36:39,245
set on heavy
stun force.

594
00:36:39,320 --> 00:36:40,344
Yes, sir.

595
00:36:46,794 --> 00:36:49,024
You don't trust me, Spock.

596
00:36:51,799 --> 00:36:54,996
In fact, I do...

597
00:36:55,069 --> 00:36:56,934
but only
to a certain point.

598
00:37:09,751 --> 00:37:10,979
Energize.

599
00:37:25,266 --> 00:37:28,201
Do they do that
all the time?

600
00:37:29,604 --> 00:37:30,696
Are you hungry?

601
00:37:30,772 --> 00:37:32,205
Uh-huh.

602
00:37:32,273 --> 00:37:33,706
What would you like?

603
00:37:33,775 --> 00:37:36,266
Maybe some
chicken soup.

604
00:38:01,302 --> 00:38:02,599
It is.

605
00:38:20,755 --> 00:38:22,518
Just a minute, sir.

606
00:38:22,590 --> 00:38:23,818
Hold it.

607
00:38:28,763 --> 00:38:30,196
[Knock On Door]

608
00:38:30,264 --> 00:38:32,061
See what that is, airman.

609
00:38:47,782 --> 00:38:49,807
Don't you find that
painful, Captain?

610
00:38:49,884 --> 00:38:52,216
Yes, I do.
What's he doing here?

611
00:38:52,286 --> 00:38:54,720
He knew the exact
beam down coordinates.

612
00:38:54,789 --> 00:38:57,223
It was necessary
to bring him along.

613
00:38:57,291 --> 00:38:58,758
I see.
No harm done.

614
00:38:58,826 --> 00:39:01,420
Mr. Sulu, did you check out
those tapes?

615
00:39:01,496 --> 00:39:03,896
Mr. Spock ran them through.
We got them all.

616
00:39:03,965 --> 00:39:05,660
They know
you've been here.

617
00:39:05,733 --> 00:39:08,065
They have a mystery
and no answers.

618
00:39:08,135 --> 00:39:10,126
Mr. Sulu, signal
the transporter chief.

619
00:39:10,204 --> 00:39:11,569
Four to beam up.

620
00:39:11,639 --> 00:39:12,663
Uh-uh. Not me.

621
00:39:25,753 --> 00:39:28,278
Don't be a fool.

622
00:39:28,356 --> 00:39:30,824
You know
what's at stake.

623
00:39:30,892 --> 00:39:32,291
You bet I do--

624
00:39:32,360 --> 00:39:35,454
My family.
A son that isn't born yet.

625
00:39:35,530 --> 00:39:38,397
You don't have to
return me now, Captain.

626
00:39:40,735 --> 00:39:42,168
Spock,
come out of there.

627
00:39:42,236 --> 00:39:44,534
You can't explain
your presence here.

628
00:39:44,605 --> 00:39:47,039
It's my duty
to report everything.

629
00:39:47,108 --> 00:39:49,167
That's explanation
enough.

630
00:39:50,378 --> 00:39:51,310
Spock!

631
00:39:51,379 --> 00:39:54,314
You'll go home,
Christopher...

632
00:39:54,382 --> 00:39:56,816
but you'll do it
our way.

633
00:39:56,884 --> 00:39:58,545
Over my dead body.

634
00:40:04,058 --> 00:40:07,755
I suspected he might not wish
to return with us.

635
00:40:09,363 --> 00:40:10,762
Four to beam up,
Mr. Sulu.

636
00:40:10,831 --> 00:40:12,958
Yes, sir.

637
00:40:13,034 --> 00:40:15,832
Captain 's Log,
Stardate 3114.1.

638
00:40:15,903 --> 00:40:19,339
We must make an attempt
to break free of this time,

639
00:40:19,407 --> 00:40:21,341
or we and our
reluctant passengers

640
00:40:21,409 --> 00:40:22,899
will remain its prisoners.

641
00:40:22,977 --> 00:40:25,343
All we have is a theory

642
00:40:25,413 --> 00:40:27,142
anda few facts.

643
00:40:27,214 --> 00:40:29,205
Mr. Scott and I
both agree

644
00:40:29,283 --> 00:40:31,114
that the only
possible solution

645
00:40:31,185 --> 00:40:32,345
is the slingshot
effect,

646
00:40:32,420 --> 00:40:34,854
Like the one
that put us here.

647
00:40:34,922 --> 00:40:36,355
My computations indicate

648
00:40:36,424 --> 00:40:38,358
that if we fly
toward the sun,

649
00:40:38,426 --> 00:40:40,917
seek out its
magnetic attraction,

650
00:40:40,995 --> 00:40:42,986
then pull away
at full power,

651
00:40:43,064 --> 00:40:45,931
the whiplash will propel us into
another time warp.

652
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,366
Slingshot effects
are fine for you people.

653
00:40:48,436 --> 00:40:51,872
How do you propose
to return the Sergeant and me?

654
00:40:51,939 --> 00:40:55,375
Logically, as we move faster
and faster toward the sun,

655
00:40:55,443 --> 00:40:58,378
we'll begin to move
backward in time.

656
00:40:58,446 --> 00:41:00,971
We'll actually go back
beyond yesterday,

657
00:41:01,048 --> 00:41:03,949
beyond the point when we first
appeared in the sky.

658
00:41:04,018 --> 00:41:08,114
Then, breaking free
will shoot us forward in time,

659
00:41:08,189 --> 00:41:11,886
and we'll transport you back
before any of this happened.

660
00:41:11,959 --> 00:41:13,324
You won't remember
anything,

661
00:41:13,394 --> 00:41:15,385
because it never
would have happened.

662
00:41:15,463 --> 00:41:18,489
What if you can't pull free
of the sun?

663
00:41:18,566 --> 00:41:20,329
We'll not be
getting so close

664
00:41:20,401 --> 00:41:23,336
that my engines
couldn't pull us out.

665
00:41:23,404 --> 00:41:25,338
What I am worried
about, sir--

666
00:41:25,406 --> 00:41:27,340
We may not have
much control

667
00:41:27,408 --> 00:41:29,342
when we're thrown
forward again.

668
00:41:29,410 --> 00:41:31,207
Helm control?

669
00:41:31,278 --> 00:41:34,145
Braking control, sir.
If I can't stop us soon enough,

670
00:41:34,215 --> 00:41:36,183
we may overshoot
our time,

671
00:41:36,250 --> 00:41:39,014
and if I stop
the engines suddenly,

672
00:41:39,086 --> 00:41:41,077
the strain may
tear us apart.

673
00:41:41,155 --> 00:41:44,784
Any way we do it,
it's a mighty rough ride.

674
00:41:47,428 --> 00:41:50,454
Well, gentlemen,
we all have to take a chance--

675
00:41:50,531 --> 00:41:53,557
especially
if one is all you have.

676
00:41:53,634 --> 00:41:55,431
Assume your stations.

677
00:42:10,051 --> 00:42:11,643
Affirmative.

678
00:42:11,719 --> 00:42:13,311
Engineering to bridge.

679
00:42:13,387 --> 00:42:16,584
Environmentalcontrol,
negative.

680
00:42:18,893 --> 00:42:20,827
Engineering control,
negative.

681
00:42:20,895 --> 00:42:22,829
Ahead warp factor 3,
Mr. Sulu.

682
00:42:22,897 --> 00:42:25,331
Warp factor 3, sir.

683
00:42:29,103 --> 00:42:32,334
I never thought
I'd make it into space.

684
00:42:32,406 --> 00:42:35,967
I was in line to be chosen
for the space program...

685
00:42:36,043 --> 00:42:38,068
but I didn't qualify.

686
00:42:38,145 --> 00:42:40,136
Take a good look
around, Captain.

687
00:42:40,214 --> 00:42:43,706
You made it here
ahead of all of them.

688
00:42:54,428 --> 00:42:56,191
Sir, our speed
is increasing.

689
00:42:56,263 --> 00:42:58,356
We're traveling
at warp 8.

690
00:42:58,432 --> 00:42:59,660
Mr. Spock.

691
00:42:59,734 --> 00:43:01,361
Since we've passed Mercury,

692
00:43:01,435 --> 00:43:04,302
the sun's pull on us
has increased greatly.

693
00:43:04,371 --> 00:43:06,305
From here,
we'll move even faster.

694
00:43:06,373 --> 00:43:09,069
And, Captain,
notice the chronometers.

695
00:43:09,143 --> 00:43:10,303
They've started
backward.

696
00:43:10,377 --> 00:43:11,605
Minute by minute,

697
00:43:11,679 --> 00:43:17,015
the speed o ftime passage
will now increase.

698
00:43:17,084 --> 00:43:19,484
Get your gear.
Report to the transporter room.

699
00:43:19,553 --> 00:43:20,815
And Captain
Christopher,

700
00:43:20,888 --> 00:43:24,881
you only have about 15 years,
so you'd better hurry.

701
00:43:33,901 --> 00:43:36,131
Approaching
breakaway point.

702
00:43:36,203 --> 00:43:38,034
On the countdown.

703
00:43:38,105 --> 00:43:39,868
10...

704
00:43:39,940 --> 00:43:41,669
9...8...

705
00:43:41,742 --> 00:43:44,040
7...6...

706
00:43:44,111 --> 00:43:46,079
5...4...

707
00:43:46,147 --> 00:43:47,739
3...2...

708
00:43:47,815 --> 00:43:48,907
Now, Mr. Sulu.

709
00:44:01,295 --> 00:44:03,286
More power, Mr. Sulu.

710
00:44:05,332 --> 00:44:07,698
Maximum now, sir.
She's fighting it.

711
00:44:26,520 --> 00:44:29,353
Engineering, can you give
a damage report?

712
00:44:36,030 --> 00:44:38,828
Point 5here.
Confirm.

713
00:44:38,899 --> 00:44:40,833
Gravity is down
to point 8.

714
00:44:40,901 --> 00:44:43,426
We've broken free
and heading back.

715
00:44:43,504 --> 00:44:44,835
Gaining speed now,
Captain.

716
00:44:44,905 --> 00:44:47,032
We're now at warp 4.

717
00:44:47,107 --> 00:44:49,007
Warp 7.

718
00:44:49,076 --> 00:44:50,065
8.

719
00:44:50,144 --> 00:44:51,975
Off the dial, sir.

720
00:44:52,046 --> 00:44:54,947
Chronometer is moving forward
again, Captain.

721
00:44:55,015 --> 00:44:56,846
You have
the chronometer reading

722
00:44:56,917 --> 00:44:59,750
and the coordinates to return
Captain Christopher and the guard?

723
00:44:59,820 --> 00:45:01,344
Computed.

724
00:45:01,422 --> 00:45:03,583
Bridge to transporter room.
Captain Christopher.

725
00:45:06,360 --> 00:45:08,555
This is Christopher.

726
00:45:08,629 --> 00:45:10,790
We're coming up
on Earth fast, Captain.

727
00:45:10,865 --> 00:45:12,389
Everything A-okay.

728
00:45:12,466 --> 00:45:16,300
Uh, Captain...

729
00:45:16,370 --> 00:45:17,837
thanks for
the look ahead.

730
00:45:17,905 --> 00:45:20,965
Our pleasure, Captain.
Bridge out.

731
00:45:29,884 --> 00:45:31,818
20 minutes, sir.
It'll be close.

732
00:45:31,886 --> 00:45:34,320
Bridge to transporter room.

733
00:45:34,388 --> 00:45:36,322
Prepare to energize.

734
00:45:36,390 --> 00:45:39,018
10 minutes.

735
00:45:39,093 --> 00:45:40,560
9...

736
00:45:40,628 --> 00:45:41,617
8...

737
00:45:41,695 --> 00:45:43,060
7...

738
00:45:43,130 --> 00:45:44,097
6...

739
00:45:44,164 --> 00:45:45,961
5...4...

740
00:45:46,033 --> 00:45:47,330
3...2...

741
00:45:47,401 --> 00:45:48,390
Energize.

742
00:45:50,671 --> 00:45:52,195
You should be
close enough

743
00:45:52,273 --> 00:45:54,264
for a visual contact.

744
00:46:13,127 --> 00:46:15,061
Bluejay 4.
Can you see it?

745
00:46:15,129 --> 00:46:16,528
What is it?

746
00:46:18,766 --> 00:46:22,463
Bluejay 4. Come in.
We've lost the image.

747
00:46:24,438 --> 00:46:27,805
Blackjack,
this is Bluejay 4.

748
00:46:27,875 --> 00:46:30,810
I could have sworn there was
some kind of ship, but...

749
00:46:30,878 --> 00:46:32,846
nothing could have
moved that fast.

750
00:46:34,348 --> 00:46:36,578
We don't track mirages.

751
00:46:36,650 --> 00:46:38,311
Mark it down
as another U.F. O.

752
00:46:38,385 --> 00:46:40,615
Bluejay 4
returning to base.

753
00:46:40,688 --> 00:46:42,087
Out.

754
00:46:42,156 --> 00:46:44,249
Approaching
second beaming, Captain.

755
00:46:44,325 --> 00:46:46,316
Bridge to transporter room,

756
00:46:46,393 --> 00:46:48,327
prepare to energize.

757
00:46:49,530 --> 00:46:50,656
Now.

758
00:46:50,731 --> 00:46:51,663
Energize.

759
00:47:20,894 --> 00:47:22,327
Past Pluto, sir.

760
00:47:22,396 --> 00:47:25,160
What's our reading,
Mr. Spock?

761
00:47:25,232 --> 00:47:26,790
Approaching
our century, Captain.

762
00:47:26,867 --> 00:47:29,301
Braking should begin...

763
00:47:29,370 --> 00:47:30,598
now.

764
00:47:30,671 --> 00:47:33,435
Bridge to engineering.

765
00:47:33,507 --> 00:47:34,838
Begin full braking power.

766
00:47:34,908 --> 00:47:37,877
Pulling away from the sun
weakened them, sir.

767
00:47:37,945 --> 00:47:39,845
They may blow apart
if I reverse.

768
00:47:39,913 --> 00:47:41,813
No choice, Mr. Scott.

769
00:47:41,882 --> 00:47:43,247
Aye, sir.

770
00:47:46,987 --> 00:47:48,784
50 years to go.

771
00:47:48,856 --> 00:47:50,118
Engines cutting
back, sir.

772
00:47:50,190 --> 00:47:51,384
No decrease
in speed.

773
00:47:51,458 --> 00:47:53,119
40...

774
00:47:53,193 --> 00:47:54,387
30...

775
00:47:54,461 --> 00:47:56,895
Never mind,
Mr. Spock.

776
00:48:05,572 --> 00:48:06,732
The engines!

777
00:48:19,853 --> 00:48:21,286
Engine room to bridge.

778
00:48:21,355 --> 00:48:23,289
Engines are on
full reverse,

779
00:48:23,357 --> 00:48:25,086
and they're buckling!

780
00:48:27,895 --> 00:48:29,055
Bridge!

781
00:48:31,365 --> 00:48:33,128
Mr. Scott
is still with us.

782
00:48:40,641 --> 00:48:41,938
Captain.

783
00:48:42,009 --> 00:48:43,806
Starfleet Control
calling Enterprise.

784
00:48:43,877 --> 00:48:45,811
Come in, Enterprise.

785
00:48:45,879 --> 00:48:47,676
Open a channel, Uhura.

786
00:48:49,383 --> 00:48:50,816
Frequency open, sir.

787
00:48:50,884 --> 00:48:53,819
Starfleet Control,
this is the Enterprise.

788
00:48:53,887 --> 00:48:55,821
Captain Kirk speaking.

789
00:48:55,889 --> 00:48:58,824
[Computer] Recordship arrival, dear.

790
00:49:00,928 --> 00:49:04,261
Enterprise, this is
Starfleet Control.

791
00:49:04,331 --> 00:49:06,265
Come in, please.

792
00:49:06,333 --> 00:49:08,767
Starfleet Control,
repeating message.

793
00:49:08,836 --> 00:49:11,771
The Enterprise is home.

794
00:49:11,839 --> 00:49:13,067
Kirk out.
