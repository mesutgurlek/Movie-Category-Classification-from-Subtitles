1
00:00:49,542 --> 00:00:54,250
A beginning...
is a very delicate time.

2
00:00:54,333 --> 00:00:59,542
Know then, that it is
the year 1O.191.

3
00:00:59,625 --> 00:01:04,542
The known universe is ruled by the
Padishah Emperor Shaddam the Fourth,

4
00:01:04,583 --> 00:01:07,917
my father.

5
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,667
In this time, the most
precious substance in the universe...

6
00:01:11,750 --> 00:01:14,458
is the spice, melange.

7
00:01:14,542 --> 00:01:18,167
The spice extends life.

8
00:01:18,250 --> 00:01:22,583
The spice
expands consciousness.

9
00:01:22,667 --> 00:01:27,333
The spice is vital
to space travel.

10
00:01:27,375 --> 00:01:29,875
The Spacing Guild
and its navigators,

11
00:01:29,958 --> 00:01:34,292
who the spice has mutated
over 4,OOO years,

12
00:01:34,375 --> 00:01:37,042
use the orange spice gas,

13
00:01:37,125 --> 00:01:41,458
which gives them
the ability to fold space.

14
00:01:41,542 --> 00:01:45,708
That is, travel to any part
of the universe...

15
00:01:45,792 --> 00:01:48,000
without moving.

16
00:01:48,083 --> 00:01:50,000
Oh, yes.

17
00:01:50,083 --> 00:01:52,333
I forgot to tell you.

18
00:01:52,417 --> 00:01:58,000
The spice exists on only one planet
in the entire universe.

19
00:01:58,083 --> 00:02:03,625
A desolate, dry planet
with vast deserts.

20
00:02:03,708 --> 00:02:07,750
Hidden away within the rocks
of these deserts are a people

21
00:02:07,750 --> 00:02:09,417
known as the Fremen,

22
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:12,292
who have long held a prophecy...

23
00:02:12,375 --> 00:02:14,917
that a man would come,

24
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
a messiah,

25
00:02:17,083 --> 00:02:20,958
who would lead them
to true freedom.

26
00:02:21,042 --> 00:02:24,625
The planet is Arrakis,

27
00:02:24,708 --> 00:02:29,500
also known as Dune.

28
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:58,300
LoS PiRaTaS® 2003
*** by Kurgan ***

29
00:03:55,583 --> 00:03:59,042
A secret report
within the Guild.

30
00:03:59,125 --> 00:04:02,250
Four planets have come
to our attention...

31
00:04:02,292 --> 00:04:06,625
regarding a plot which could
jeopardize spice production.

32
00:04:06,667 --> 00:04:10,792
Planet Arrakis,
source of the spice.

33
00:04:10,833 --> 00:04:15,042
Planet Caladan,
home of House Atreides.

34
00:04:15,125 --> 00:04:19,500
Planet Giedi Prime,
home of House Harkonnen.

35
00:04:19,542 --> 00:04:24,583
Planet Kaitain, home of the Emperor
of the known universe.

36
00:04:26,125 --> 00:04:29,542
Send a third-stage
guild navigator to Kaitain...

37
00:04:29,625 --> 00:04:32,583
to demand details
from the Emperor.

38
00:04:32,667 --> 00:04:35,167
The spice must flow.

39
00:05:22,042 --> 00:05:25,458
Father.
Irulan, you must leave.

40
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:48,417
A third-stage guild navigator...

41
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:50,542
will be here within minutes.

42
00:05:50,625 --> 00:05:52,542
We felt his presence.

43
00:05:52,625 --> 00:05:54,833
I shall want telepathy
during his visit...

44
00:05:54,917 --> 00:05:57,000
and a report
when we're finished.

45
00:05:57,042 --> 00:06:01,000
I am your Truthsayer,
my lord.

46
00:06:01,083 --> 00:06:02,917
He's here, my lord.

47
00:06:30,375 --> 00:06:34,583
The Bene Gesserit witch
must leave.

48
00:06:34,667 --> 00:06:37,708
Leave us.

49
00:06:37,792 --> 00:06:40,667
Yes, my lord.

50
00:06:50,833 --> 00:06:52,750
We are alone.

51
00:07:37,250 --> 00:07:42,417
We have just folded space from Ix.
Yes?

52
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:46,417
How was your journey?

53
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:51,750
Many machines on Ix.
New machines.

54
00:07:51,792 --> 00:07:54,792
Oh? Yes.

55
00:07:54,875 --> 00:08:00,125
Better than those on Richese.

56
00:08:00,208 --> 00:08:05,958
You are transparent.
I see many things.

57
00:08:06,042 --> 00:08:10,500
I see plans within plans.

58
00:08:10,542 --> 00:08:14,125
I see two great houses,

59
00:08:14,250 --> 00:08:19,500
House Atreides,
House Harkonnen, feuding.

60
00:08:19,583 --> 00:08:24,417
I see you behind it.
Yes.

61
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:28,333
You must share with us.

62
00:08:28,375 --> 00:08:31,583
The Atreides House
is building a secret army...

63
00:08:31,667 --> 00:08:33,625
using a technique unknown to us.

64
00:08:33,708 --> 00:08:36,625
A technique involving sound.

65
00:08:36,708 --> 00:08:39,542
The duke is becoming
more popular in the Landsraad.

66
00:08:39,583 --> 00:08:41,750
He could threaten me.

67
00:08:41,833 --> 00:08:45,708
I have ordered House Atreides
to occupy Arrakis to mine the spice,

68
00:08:45,792 --> 00:08:48,625
thus replacing their enemies,
the Harkonnens.

69
00:08:48,667 --> 00:08:53,167
House Atreides will not refuse
because of the tremendous power
they think they will gain.

70
00:08:53,250 --> 00:08:55,167
Then, at an appointed time,

71
00:08:55,250 --> 00:08:58,500
Baron Harkonnen
will return to Arrakis...

72
00:08:58,542 --> 00:09:01,125
and launch a sneak attack
on House Atreides.

73
00:09:01,208 --> 00:09:06,083
I have promised the baron five legions
of my Sardaukar terror troops.

74
00:09:06,167 --> 00:09:10,708
So the Harkonnens
will rid you of House Atreides.

75
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:12,417
Yes!

76
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:15,417
One small point.

77
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:17,792
Here it comes.

78
00:09:17,875 --> 00:09:21,292
We ourselves perceive
a slight problem...

79
00:09:21,333 --> 00:09:24,042
within House Atreides.

80
00:09:24,125 --> 00:09:28,667
Paul. Paul Atreides.

81
00:09:28,750 --> 00:09:32,292
You mean, of course,
Duke Leto Atreides, his father.

82
00:09:32,375 --> 00:09:36,083
I mean Paul Atreides.

83
00:09:36,167 --> 00:09:38,583
We want him killed.

84
00:09:40,583 --> 00:09:45,833
I did not say this.
I am not here.

85
00:09:45,917 --> 00:09:47,875
I understand.

86
00:10:17,583 --> 00:10:23,250
Why would they want
the duke's son killed?

87
00:10:26,458 --> 00:10:32,292
We must have a look
at Paul Atreides, on Caladan.

88
00:10:46,667 --> 00:10:50,875
The powerful Bene Gesserit sisterhood
for 9O generations...

89
00:10:50,958 --> 00:10:52,750
has been manipulating
bloodlines...

90
00:10:52,833 --> 00:10:56,958
to produce the Kwisatz Haderach,
a super being.

91
00:10:57,042 --> 00:11:01,083
On Caladan, Jessica,
a member of the sisterhood...

92
00:11:01,125 --> 00:11:04,708
and the bound concubine
of Duke Leto Atreides,

93
00:11:04,792 --> 00:11:07,792
had been ordered
to bear only daughters.

94
00:11:07,833 --> 00:11:09,625
Because of her love
for the duke...

95
00:11:09,667 --> 00:11:14,167
she disobeyed
and gave birth to a son...

96
00:11:14,250 --> 00:11:18,708
Paul... Paul Atreides.

97
00:11:26,083 --> 00:11:29,417
Here we are now, Caladan.

98
00:11:29,458 --> 00:11:34,833
And 19 light-years beyond,
beyond Bene Tleilax.

99
00:11:34,917 --> 00:11:38,750
The training planet
of the Mentats, the human computers.

100
00:11:38,833 --> 00:11:42,000
Know a Mentat
by his red-stained lips.

101
00:11:42,083 --> 00:11:44,167
There. Arrakis.

102
00:11:44,250 --> 00:11:45,958
Spice mining.

103
00:11:46,042 --> 00:11:48,833
Carryalls lower
the harvester to the sand...

104
00:11:48,875 --> 00:11:51,375
and lift it off to safety
when a worm attacks.

105
00:11:51,417 --> 00:11:55,208
Worms attack
all rhythmic vibrations.

106
00:11:55,292 --> 00:12:00,625
Weather. See storms.
No precipitation.

107
00:12:00,708 --> 00:12:04,417
Never one drop of rain on Arrakis.

108
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:08,375
And the Harkonnens are near.

109
00:12:08,458 --> 00:12:11,542
There. Giedi Prime
and the Baron Harkonnen.

110
00:12:11,625 --> 00:12:13,542
The enemy.

111
00:12:13,625 --> 00:12:16,500
The Baron Harkonnen has sworn
to destroy House Atreides...

112
00:12:16,583 --> 00:12:19,167
and steal the ducal signet ring
for himself.

113
00:12:37,792 --> 00:12:41,792
I know, Thufir.
I'm sitting with my back to the door.

114
00:12:41,875 --> 00:12:46,583
I heard you, Dr. Yueh,

115
00:12:46,667 --> 00:12:48,667
and Gurney
coming down the hall.

116
00:12:48,750 --> 00:12:52,167
Those sounds
could be imitated!

117
00:12:54,208 --> 00:12:56,167
I'd know the difference.

118
00:12:56,208 --> 00:12:59,917
Yes, perhaps you would at that.

119
00:13:02,458 --> 00:13:04,417
My father sent you to test me.

120
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:06,708
Music, then?

121
00:13:06,750 --> 00:13:11,708
No music.
I'm packing this for the crossing.

122
00:13:11,792 --> 00:13:15,542
Shield practice.
Gurney, we had practice this morning.

123
00:13:15,625 --> 00:13:17,542
I'm not in the mood.

124
00:13:17,625 --> 00:13:19,542
Not in the mood!

125
00:13:19,625 --> 00:13:24,083
Mood's a thing for cattle
and love play, not fighting!
I'm sorry, Gurney.

126
00:13:24,167 --> 00:13:26,458
Not sorry enough.

127
00:13:37,292 --> 00:13:40,708
What's wrong with Gurney?
He's not faking this.

128
00:13:40,750 --> 00:13:44,708
Now, guard yourself for true!

129
00:14:03,958 --> 00:14:06,208
Is this what you seek?

130
00:14:06,292 --> 00:14:11,292
Good. The slow blade
penetrates the shield.

131
00:14:11,375 --> 00:14:14,375
But, uh, look down.

132
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:20,083
We'd have joined each other in death.

133
00:14:20,125 --> 00:14:22,917
You did seem finally
to get the mood.

134
00:14:30,750 --> 00:14:33,667
Would you really
have drawn my blood?

135
00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:36,292
If you'd have fought
one whit below your abilities,

136
00:14:36,375 --> 00:14:39,208
I'd have given you a good scar
to remind you.

137
00:14:42,875 --> 00:14:45,667
Things have been
so serious here lately.

138
00:14:45,750 --> 00:14:47,833
Soon we leave for Arrakis.

139
00:14:47,917 --> 00:14:50,875
Arrakis is real.

140
00:14:50,958 --> 00:14:53,458
The Harkonnens are real.

141
00:14:55,083 --> 00:15:00,583
Dr. Yueh, do you have any information
on the worms of Arrakis?

142
00:15:00,667 --> 00:15:04,333
I have obtained a filmbook
of a small specimen.

143
00:15:04,417 --> 00:15:07,875
Only 125 meters long.

144
00:15:07,958 --> 00:15:10,500
Only?
There have been documented sightings...

145
00:15:10,583 --> 00:15:15,792
of worms as large as 45O meters
in the deep desert.

146
00:15:15,875 --> 00:15:19,542
That's far from where
we'll be in Arrakeen.

147
00:15:19,583 --> 00:15:24,250
The desert belt and the south
polar region are marked forbidden.

148
00:15:24,333 --> 00:15:26,500
How do the Fremen survive there?

149
00:15:26,583 --> 00:15:28,958
We don't know much
about the Fremen.

150
00:15:29,042 --> 00:15:31,792
They live in the deep desert,
some in the cities.

151
00:15:31,875 --> 00:15:34,833
They have blue within blue eyes.

152
00:15:34,917 --> 00:15:38,500
Oh, the eyes. Yes.

153
00:15:38,583 --> 00:15:41,583
The saturation of the blood
by the spice, melange.

154
00:15:41,667 --> 00:15:44,417
Could the spice affect us
in other ways?

155
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:46,667
Many dangers exist on Arrakis.

156
00:15:46,708 --> 00:15:50,500
For one, the Harkonnens
would not have given up...

157
00:15:50,583 --> 00:15:54,042
their CHOAM Company contract
so easily.

158
00:15:55,083 --> 00:15:58,583
The Harkonnens
are our enemies, yes.

159
00:15:58,667 --> 00:16:01,125
But behind them, I suspect,
is the Emperor.

160
00:16:02,958 --> 00:16:04,917
You'll make
a formidable duke.

161
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:16,167
Now remember, the first step
in avoiding a trap...

162
00:16:16,250 --> 00:16:18,500
is knowing
of its existence.

163
00:16:18,542 --> 00:16:22,625
I know. But if it is a trap,
then why are we going?

164
00:16:22,708 --> 00:16:24,625
We have our new army.

165
00:16:24,708 --> 00:16:29,667
Dr. Yueh,
put the weirding module on him.

166
00:16:34,625 --> 00:16:37,792
Well.

167
00:16:52,667 --> 00:16:55,750
Clear and lock the room!

168
00:16:55,833 --> 00:16:59,375
Detachment, stand down.

169
00:17:06,292 --> 00:17:08,208
Activate a fighter.

170
00:17:27,292 --> 00:17:29,417
Make the range two meters.

171
00:18:16,875 --> 00:18:18,958
Precise control.

172
00:18:48,917 --> 00:18:50,042
Duncan!

173
00:18:52,375 --> 00:18:56,583
Paul. I was just on my way
to say good-bye to you.

174
00:18:56,667 --> 00:19:00,417
I have to go on ahead.
I won't be seeing you for a while.

175
00:19:00,458 --> 00:19:02,208
I wish you were
coming with us. Why?

176
00:19:02,292 --> 00:19:06,917
Something for your father.
He wants to talk to you.

177
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,833
I'll see you on Arrakis.

178
00:19:10,958 --> 00:19:12,875
May the hand of God
be with you.

179
00:19:12,958 --> 00:19:15,125
May the hand of God
be with us all, Duncan.

180
00:19:32,417 --> 00:19:35,583
Father.
Thank you for joining me, Paul.

181
00:19:35,667 --> 00:19:40,542
Thufir Hawat has served House Atreides
three generations.

182
00:19:40,625 --> 00:19:45,708
He swears you are the finest student
he has ever taught.

183
00:19:45,792 --> 00:19:49,167
Yueh, Gurney and Duncan
say the same.

184
00:19:52,333 --> 00:19:55,750
Makes me feel very proud.
I want you to be proud of me.

185
00:20:07,625 --> 00:20:10,750
I'll miss the sea.

186
00:20:12,917 --> 00:20:16,083
But a person needs
new experiences.

187
00:20:16,167 --> 00:20:19,583
They jar something
deep inside,

188
00:20:19,667 --> 00:20:23,792
allowing him to grow.

189
00:20:23,833 --> 00:20:29,833
Without change,
something sleeps inside us...

190
00:20:32,083 --> 00:20:34,042
and seldom awakens.

191
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,542
The sleeper must awaken.

192
00:21:06,708 --> 00:21:09,375
Arrakis.

193
00:21:09,417 --> 00:21:14,417
Dune... Desert planet...

194
00:21:16,958 --> 00:21:19,750
I will kill you.

195
00:21:20,417 --> 00:21:22,917
The second moon.

196
00:21:31,083 --> 00:21:33,042
Tell me of your home world, Usul.

197
00:21:45,083 --> 00:21:48,083
I know she has come to test him.

198
00:21:48,167 --> 00:21:52,667
No man has ever been tested
with the box.

199
00:21:52,750 --> 00:21:56,125
Tonight, I may lose my son.

200
00:22:18,917 --> 00:22:24,708
Jessica, you were told to bear
only daughters to the Atreides.

201
00:22:24,792 --> 00:22:25,917
Jessica!

202
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,167
It meant so much to him.

203
00:22:28,250 --> 00:22:32,125
You thought only of a duke's desire
for a son?

204
00:22:32,167 --> 00:22:34,125
Desires don't come into this.

205
00:22:34,167 --> 00:22:37,167
An Atreides daughter
could have been wed...

206
00:22:37,208 --> 00:22:40,458
to a Harkonnen heir
and sealed the breach.

207
00:22:40,542 --> 00:22:43,875
We may lose
both bloodlines now.

208
00:22:43,958 --> 00:22:49,667
I vowed never
to regret my decision.

209
00:22:49,750 --> 00:22:53,125
I'll pay for all my own mistakes.

210
00:22:53,208 --> 00:22:55,917
And your son will pay with you.

211
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:02,208
Arrakis... Dune...
Desert planet.

212
00:23:04,042 --> 00:23:08,000
Moving. Moving.

213
00:23:29,833 --> 00:23:31,875
We'll salvage what we can.

214
00:23:31,958 --> 00:23:35,542
But I can tell you,
dear God...

215
00:23:35,625 --> 00:23:38,208
For the father, nothing.

216
00:23:38,292 --> 00:23:40,792
For the father, nothing?

217
00:23:40,875 --> 00:23:44,125
Did you really think you could bear
the Kwisatz Haderach?

218
00:23:44,167 --> 00:23:49,375
The universe's super being?
How dare you?

219
00:23:49,458 --> 00:23:52,875
My greatest student.

220
00:23:52,917 --> 00:23:56,750
And my greatest disappointment.

221
00:23:59,917 --> 00:24:04,208
He's awake.
He's listening to us.

222
00:24:04,583 --> 00:24:06,792
Good. Ready yourself,
young Paul Atreides.

223
00:24:06,875 --> 00:24:10,125
I want to see you in your mother's
chambers in one quarter of an hour.

224
00:24:13,542 --> 00:24:18,875
Paul, this is very important.

225
00:24:22,667 --> 00:24:26,708
Kwisatz Haderach. The super being.

226
00:24:26,750 --> 00:24:29,500
For the father, nothing.

227
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,917
Vas.

228
00:25:00,083 --> 00:25:03,750
This is the Reverend Mother
Gaius Helen Mohiam.

229
00:25:03,833 --> 00:25:07,542
She's going to observe you.

230
00:25:10,833 --> 00:25:13,875
Please.
Jessica,

231
00:25:13,958 --> 00:25:15,750
you know it must be done.

232
00:25:15,833 --> 00:25:18,292
Your Reverence.

233
00:25:18,375 --> 00:25:20,375
What does she fear?

234
00:25:21,167 --> 00:25:23,542
What about my father?

235
00:25:23,625 --> 00:25:25,042
Paul.

236
00:25:25,125 --> 00:25:29,167
Listen to the Reverend Mother
and do what she tells you.

237
00:25:37,042 --> 00:25:40,667
Now you...

238
00:25:40,750 --> 00:25:42,667
come here!

239
00:25:42,750 --> 00:25:45,792
She's using the Voice.

240
00:25:45,833 --> 00:25:47,792
No.

241
00:25:47,833 --> 00:25:50,375
Some strength there.

242
00:25:50,458 --> 00:25:52,708
Surprising.

243
00:25:52,792 --> 00:25:54,833
Come here!

244
00:26:13,750 --> 00:26:17,792
Do you see this?

245
00:26:17,875 --> 00:26:20,500
Put your right hand
in the box.

246
00:26:20,583 --> 00:26:22,500
What's in the box?

247
00:26:22,583 --> 00:26:26,417
Pain. Stop!

248
00:26:26,500 --> 00:26:29,167
Put your hand in the box.

249
00:26:34,417 --> 00:26:37,125
I hold at your neck
the gom jabbar.

250
00:26:37,208 --> 00:26:41,792
This one kills only animals.

251
00:26:41,875 --> 00:26:44,250
Are you suggesting
a duke's son is an animal?

252
00:26:44,292 --> 00:26:47,917
Let us say I suggest
you may be human.

253
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:52,125
Your awareness may be powerful enough
to control your instincts.

254
00:26:52,167 --> 00:26:57,000
Your instinct will be
to remove your hand from the box.

255
00:26:57,042 --> 00:27:00,542
If you do so, you die.

256
00:27:03,708 --> 00:27:07,500
You will feel...

257
00:27:07,583 --> 00:27:11,958
an itching.

258
00:27:12,042 --> 00:27:14,750
There.

259
00:27:14,792 --> 00:27:18,833
Now the itching becomes...

260
00:27:18,917 --> 00:27:20,792
burning.

261
00:27:20,875 --> 00:27:23,000
Heat upon heat.

262
00:27:23,083 --> 00:27:25,000
Upon heat!
It burns.

263
00:27:25,083 --> 00:27:27,125
Silence! Silence!

264
00:27:27,208 --> 00:27:30,875
I must not fear.
Fear is the mind killer.

265
00:27:30,958 --> 00:27:33,500
Fear is the little death
that brings total obliteration.

266
00:27:33,583 --> 00:27:35,542
I will face my fear.

267
00:27:35,583 --> 00:27:39,583
I will permit it to pass
over me and through me.

268
00:27:39,667 --> 00:27:43,542
I must not fear.
You feel the flesh crisping?

269
00:27:43,583 --> 00:27:47,042
is the little death
that brings total obliteration.

270
00:27:47,083 --> 00:27:50,917
Flesh... dropping off.

271
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:54,542
Fear is the little... death!

272
00:27:54,625 --> 00:27:56,583
I must not fear.

273
00:27:56,667 --> 00:27:59,375
Fear is the little death.

274
00:27:59,458 --> 00:28:01,458
I'm...

275
00:28:02,667 --> 00:28:04,542
The pain!
No!

276
00:28:04,625 --> 00:28:06,125
Enough.

277
00:28:09,042 --> 00:28:14,208
Kull wahad. No woman child
ever withstood that much.

278
00:28:17,542 --> 00:28:20,458
Take your hand out of the box
and look at it,

279
00:28:20,542 --> 00:28:22,458
young human.

280
00:28:22,542 --> 00:28:26,500
Do it!

281
00:28:32,167 --> 00:28:34,458
Pain by nerve induction.

282
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:36,375
A human can resist any pain.

283
00:28:36,458 --> 00:28:39,250
Our test is crisis
and observation.

284
00:28:39,333 --> 00:28:41,667
I see the truth of it.

285
00:28:41,708 --> 00:28:45,542
Could he be the one? Maybe.

286
00:28:45,625 --> 00:28:48,458
But will he be
ours to control?

287
00:28:50,125 --> 00:28:53,000
Tell me of your home world, Usul.

288
00:28:56,375 --> 00:28:59,917
Do you know
of the Water of Life?

289
00:28:59,958 --> 00:29:03,500
The bile from the newborn worms
of Arrakis?

290
00:29:03,583 --> 00:29:06,042
I have heard of it.
It is very dangerous.

291
00:29:06,125 --> 00:29:11,583
The Bene Gesserit sisterhood
use it to see within.

292
00:29:11,667 --> 00:29:16,417
There is a place
terrifying to us,

293
00:29:16,500 --> 00:29:18,667
to women.

294
00:29:18,708 --> 00:29:24,375
It is said
a man will come,

295
00:29:24,417 --> 00:29:27,542
the Kwisatz Haderach.

296
00:29:27,625 --> 00:29:32,083
He will go
where we cannot.

297
00:29:32,125 --> 00:29:34,625
Many men have tried.

298
00:29:34,667 --> 00:29:36,625
They tried and failed?

299
00:29:36,708 --> 00:29:39,625
They tried and died.

300
00:29:39,667 --> 00:29:42,000
Jessica.

301
00:29:47,625 --> 00:29:52,333
My son lives.

302
00:29:54,958 --> 00:29:58,500
I sense your teachings in him.

303
00:29:58,583 --> 00:30:02,208
Ignore the regular order
of training.

304
00:30:02,292 --> 00:30:04,208
His safety requires the Voice.

305
00:30:04,292 --> 00:30:06,208
I've heard enough of my safety.

306
00:30:06,292 --> 00:30:08,625
What about my father?

307
00:30:08,667 --> 00:30:10,667
I heard your talking.

308
00:30:10,708 --> 00:30:14,042
You speak as if he were dead.
Well, he's not.

309
00:30:14,125 --> 00:30:16,750
And he won't die.
Tell me he won't die.

310
00:30:16,833 --> 00:30:21,125
What can be done has been done.
Mother, tell me.

311
00:30:45,625 --> 00:30:50,333
Message for Mentat Piter De Vries.

312
00:30:50,375 --> 00:30:53,333
The Baron is impatient
for Leto's reply.

313
00:30:55,250 --> 00:30:58,417
It is by will alone
I set my mind in motion.

314
00:30:58,500 --> 00:31:00,958
It is by the juice of Sapho
that thoughts acquire speed,

315
00:31:01,042 --> 00:31:03,417
the lips acquire stains,
the stains become a warning.

316
00:31:03,500 --> 00:31:06,125
It is by will alone
I set my mind in motion.

317
00:31:09,667 --> 00:31:11,792
It is by will alone
I set my mind in motion.

318
00:31:11,875 --> 00:31:14,125
It is by the juice of Sapho
that thoughts acquire speed,

319
00:31:14,167 --> 00:31:16,625
the lips acquire stains,
the stains become a warning.

320
00:31:16,708 --> 00:31:19,042
It is by will alone
I set my mind in motion.

321
00:32:21,833 --> 00:32:23,750
My lord.

322
00:32:23,833 --> 00:32:25,750
Piter.

323
00:32:27,042 --> 00:32:29,375
The Atreides will be leaving
Caladan soon, Baron,

324
00:32:29,458 --> 00:32:32,375
and I have here your answer
from Duke Leto.

325
00:32:32,458 --> 00:32:35,250
What does Leto say, Piter?

326
00:32:35,333 --> 00:32:40,958
He wishes to inform you that "vendetta,"
as he puts it, using the ancient tongue,

327
00:32:41,042 --> 00:32:44,083
the art of Kanly,
is still alive.

328
00:32:44,125 --> 00:32:47,417
He does not wish to meet
or speak with you.

329
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,958
I've made my peace gesture.

330
00:32:52,042 --> 00:32:54,625
The forms of Kanly
have been obeyed!

331
00:32:56,542 --> 00:32:59,167
Bring in Feyd and Rabban.

332
00:33:25,417 --> 00:33:27,708
As you instructed me,

333
00:33:27,792 --> 00:33:31,292
I have enlightened your nephews
concerning my plan...

334
00:33:31,375 --> 00:33:33,833
My plan!

335
00:33:33,875 --> 00:33:38,417
The plan...
to crush the Atreides.

336
00:33:39,583 --> 00:33:41,583
Feyd.

337
00:33:41,625 --> 00:33:43,583
Rabban.

338
00:33:43,625 --> 00:33:46,917
Go quietly.

339
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:50,833
No other great house
of the Landsraad...

340
00:33:50,917 --> 00:33:55,292
must ever know of the Emperor's aid
to the Baron.

341
00:33:55,375 --> 00:33:59,833
The entire Landsraad
would turn against the Baron...

342
00:33:59,917 --> 00:34:02,000
and the Emperor.

343
00:34:02,083 --> 00:34:05,125
Put the pick in there, Pete,

344
00:34:05,208 --> 00:34:08,833
and turn it 'round real neat.

345
00:34:29,583 --> 00:34:33,333
You are so beautiful, my Baron.

346
00:34:33,417 --> 00:34:38,000
Your skin, love to me.

347
00:34:38,042 --> 00:34:41,250
Your diseases,
lovingly cared for...

348
00:34:41,333 --> 00:34:43,792
for all eternity.

349
00:34:50,375 --> 00:34:52,583
I will have Arrakis back for myself.

350
00:34:52,667 --> 00:34:56,708
He who controls the spice
controls the universe!

351
00:34:56,792 --> 00:34:59,000
And what Piter
did not tell you...

352
00:34:59,083 --> 00:35:02,333
is we have control
of someone who is very close,

353
00:35:02,417 --> 00:35:05,833
very close to Duke Leto.

354
00:35:05,917 --> 00:35:08,167
This person, this traitor,

355
00:35:08,250 --> 00:35:12,042
will be worth more to us
than ten legions of Sardaukar!

356
00:35:12,125 --> 00:35:14,875
And who is this traitor?

357
00:35:14,958 --> 00:35:17,708
I won't tell you who the traitor is...

358
00:35:17,792 --> 00:35:20,292
or when we'll attack.

359
00:35:20,375 --> 00:35:24,458
However, the duke will die
before these eyes,

360
00:35:24,542 --> 00:35:28,042
and he'll know,
he'll know that it is I,

361
00:35:28,125 --> 00:35:32,083
Baron Vladimir Harkonnen,
who encompasses his doom!

362
00:35:41,625 --> 00:35:43,542
Ha, ha! Ha, ha!

363
00:36:49,458 --> 00:36:53,500
This is what I'll do
to the duke and his family.

364
00:37:31,042 --> 00:37:34,833
Oh, I'll miss Caladan so much.

365
00:37:59,625 --> 00:38:02,458
Caladan.

366
00:38:53,875 --> 00:38:57,125
Soon they will begin
to fold space.

367
00:38:57,167 --> 00:39:01,958
Far off
in the control rooms of spice gas...

368
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:05,542
traveling... without moving.

369
00:41:23,417 --> 00:41:27,542
And now, the prophecy.

370
00:41:27,625 --> 00:41:32,292
One will come.

371
00:41:32,333 --> 00:41:36,083
The voice from the outer world,

372
00:41:36,167 --> 00:41:39,292
bringing the holy war,

373
00:41:39,375 --> 00:41:44,125
the jihad, which will
cleanse the universe...

374
00:41:44,208 --> 00:41:48,333
and bring us
out of darkness.

375
00:42:15,250 --> 00:42:19,542
House Atreides took control
of Arrakis 63 standard days...

376
00:42:19,625 --> 00:42:22,833
into the year 1O.191.

377
00:42:22,917 --> 00:42:26,375
It was known that the Harkonnens,
the former rulers of Arrakis,

378
00:42:26,458 --> 00:42:30,583
would leave
many suicide troops behind.

379
00:42:30,667 --> 00:42:33,000
Atreides patrols were doubled.

380
00:42:44,875 --> 00:42:47,000
Duncan.

381
00:42:49,208 --> 00:42:52,500
What have you discovered
about the Fremen, Duncan?

382
00:42:52,583 --> 00:42:56,042
Tell me. Why haven't
we heard from you?

383
00:42:56,083 --> 00:42:59,417
My lord, I suspect so much.

384
00:43:01,125 --> 00:43:03,583
I think they
are the allies we seek.

385
00:43:03,625 --> 00:43:05,583
They are strong, fierce.

386
00:43:05,625 --> 00:43:08,458
They do not give their loyalty
easily or quickly.

387
00:43:08,542 --> 00:43:13,625
As you know, the Imperium has never been
able to take a census of the Fremen.

388
00:43:13,667 --> 00:43:17,125
Everyone thinks that there are but few
wandering here and there in the desert.

389
00:43:17,208 --> 00:43:20,167
My lord,

390
00:43:20,208 --> 00:43:23,250
I suspect an incredible secret
has been kept on this planet,

391
00:43:23,333 --> 00:43:27,208
that the Fremen exist
in vast numbers...

392
00:43:28,125 --> 00:43:30,250
vast...

393
00:43:30,333 --> 00:43:33,875
and it is they
who control Arrakis.

394
00:43:41,292 --> 00:43:43,125
Each trooper
will be charged with responsibility...

395
00:43:43,208 --> 00:43:45,167
for preserving water.

396
00:43:45,208 --> 00:43:47,542
Our existence
as an operating army...

397
00:43:47,625 --> 00:43:50,333
depends on these following
water-saving procedures.

398
00:43:50,417 --> 00:43:53,208
Remember, water is life.

399
00:43:56,833 --> 00:44:00,625
Why is the shield not yet up?

400
00:44:00,708 --> 00:44:04,042
Sir, we found and removed
another sabotage device.

401
00:44:04,083 --> 00:44:06,083
I think it'll
go up now, sir.

402
00:44:06,167 --> 00:44:10,958
Armed forces prospects
for rehabilitation are good.

403
00:44:11,042 --> 00:44:14,042
We're finding
these sabotage devices too easily.

404
00:44:24,292 --> 00:44:27,208
House shield activating.

405
00:44:34,750 --> 00:44:39,750
Duke Leto is now here. Spice mining
inspection to start immediately.

406
00:44:56,500 --> 00:44:58,667
So you are Dr. Kynes,

407
00:44:58,750 --> 00:45:00,792
the Judge of the change.

408
00:45:00,875 --> 00:45:05,208
And the Imperial Ecologist, sire.
Our intelligence informs us...

409
00:45:05,292 --> 00:45:07,917
that there's still
a strong Harkonnen presence.

410
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,208
The process of removal continues.

411
00:45:10,250 --> 00:45:12,625
This is my son, Paul.

412
00:45:14,500 --> 00:45:17,083
Are you a Fremen?
I've been on Arrakis...

413
00:45:17,167 --> 00:45:19,958
in the service of the Emperor
long enough for my eyes to change.

414
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:22,167
In the service of the Emperor.

415
00:45:22,250 --> 00:45:24,167
We are in your hands, Doctor.

416
00:45:24,250 --> 00:45:27,167
Your gift of the stillsuits
is much appreciated.

417
00:45:27,208 --> 00:45:29,708
Will you give us an explanation
of their workings?

418
00:45:29,792 --> 00:45:33,833
Well, this is a stillsuit
of Fremen manufacture,

419
00:45:33,917 --> 00:45:35,875
the most efficient type
on Arrakis.

420
00:45:35,917 --> 00:45:38,292
Basically...

421
00:45:40,417 --> 00:45:42,542
It's all right, Gurney.

422
00:45:42,625 --> 00:45:44,833
Yes, sire.

423
00:45:45,917 --> 00:45:47,875
Basically,

424
00:45:47,958 --> 00:45:51,917
it's a high efficiency
filter and heat exchange system.

425
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:55,292
Perspiration passes through
the first layer,

426
00:45:55,333 --> 00:45:57,375
and is gathered
in the second,

427
00:45:57,458 --> 00:45:59,792
where salt is separated.

428
00:45:59,833 --> 00:46:03,958
Breathing and walking
provide the pumping action.

429
00:46:04,042 --> 00:46:07,750
The reclaimed water
circulates to catch pockets...

430
00:46:07,833 --> 00:46:11,042
from which you can drink
through this tube...

431
00:46:11,125 --> 00:46:13,167
at your neck.

432
00:46:13,250 --> 00:46:16,875
Urine and feces are processed
in the thigh pads.

433
00:46:16,917 --> 00:46:20,375
Should you be
in the open desert,

434
00:46:20,417 --> 00:46:22,750
remember to breathe in
through your mouth...

435
00:46:22,833 --> 00:46:25,417
and out through
this nose tube.

436
00:46:25,458 --> 00:46:28,167
With a Fremen suit
in good working condition,

437
00:46:28,250 --> 00:46:30,458
Life can be sustained
for weeks,

438
00:46:30,542 --> 00:46:34,667
even in the deep desert, sire.

439
00:46:34,750 --> 00:46:36,667
My thanks.

440
00:46:36,750 --> 00:46:38,708
With your permission.

441
00:46:41,208 --> 00:46:44,667
You've worn a stillsuit before.
No.

442
00:46:44,750 --> 00:46:47,500
Your suit is fitted
desert fashion.

443
00:46:47,583 --> 00:46:51,042
Who told you how to do that?
No one.

444
00:46:51,125 --> 00:46:53,083
It seemed the proper way.

445
00:46:55,958 --> 00:46:58,333
That it is.

446
00:46:58,417 --> 00:47:03,458
He shall know your ways
as if born to them.

447
00:47:03,542 --> 00:47:06,125
We're wasting time, sire.

448
00:47:21,625 --> 00:47:24,917
Battle language?
Translate it.

449
00:47:27,958 --> 00:47:30,167
Very faint.

450
00:47:34,542 --> 00:47:36,750
Harkonnen!

451
00:47:41,917 --> 00:47:44,625
Airspeed: zero five.

452
00:47:44,708 --> 00:47:48,875
Ambient temperature:
3OO degrees Kelvin.

453
00:47:48,958 --> 00:47:50,917
Airspeed: three zero.

454
00:47:55,583 --> 00:47:57,792
75% efficiency.

455
00:48:03,958 --> 00:48:07,417
That's where I told your sandmaster
to concentrate the harvesting today.

456
00:48:07,500 --> 00:48:10,708
Southeast, over the shield wall.

457
00:48:12,750 --> 00:48:17,875
Ambient temperature: 35O degrees Kelvin.

458
00:48:17,958 --> 00:48:20,333
Airspeed: one three zero.

459
00:48:23,375 --> 00:48:25,542
Caution: You've now cleared
protective shield wall...

460
00:48:25,583 --> 00:48:28,208
and entered open desert.

461
00:48:36,458 --> 00:48:38,792
Will we see a worm?

462
00:48:38,833 --> 00:48:42,792
Where there's spice and spice mining,
there are always worms.

463
00:48:42,875 --> 00:48:45,750
Always.
Always.

464
00:48:45,833 --> 00:48:47,792
Why do they come?

465
00:48:47,833 --> 00:48:50,333
To protect their territory.

466
00:48:50,417 --> 00:48:52,667
Vibrations attract them.

467
00:48:52,708 --> 00:48:54,833
He must be a Fremen,

468
00:48:54,917 --> 00:48:56,875
or in with them.

469
00:48:56,917 --> 00:48:58,875
He's studying us.

470
00:48:58,917 --> 00:49:01,500
He's hiding something
about the spice.

471
00:49:01,583 --> 00:49:04,042
Is there a relationship
between the worms and the spice?

472
00:49:06,292 --> 00:49:11,167
As I said,
they defend the spice sand.

473
00:49:11,250 --> 00:49:15,167
As to their relationship
with the spice,

474
00:49:15,250 --> 00:49:17,208
who knows?

475
00:49:33,042 --> 00:49:34,958
My message. It's here.

476
00:49:39,167 --> 00:49:44,417
There are more enemy bodies coming in
for your inspection, Doctor Yueh.

477
00:49:48,708 --> 00:49:52,750
Are you all right?
Yes, I'm fine.

478
00:49:52,833 --> 00:49:55,250
Thank you, Thufir.

479
00:49:58,750 --> 00:50:02,292
Dust cloud ahead, sire.
That's it. Spice mining.

480
00:50:02,375 --> 00:50:05,833
No other cloud quite like it.

481
00:50:08,958 --> 00:50:12,208
Wormsign. Is it wormsign?

482
00:50:12,250 --> 00:50:14,875
Yes. Worm. Big one.

483
00:50:14,917 --> 00:50:17,333
You've got sharp eyes.
May I?

484
00:50:20,917 --> 00:50:23,833
Calling Harvester Pad Nine.
Wormsign.

485
00:50:23,917 --> 00:50:25,917
Who calls Pad Nine?

486
00:50:25,958 --> 00:50:29,042
Don't mention the duke.
This is an uncoded channel.

487
00:50:29,125 --> 00:50:33,667
Unlisted flight northeast of you.
Wormsign on intercept course.

488
00:50:33,750 --> 00:50:36,667
Estimated contact: 15 minutes.

489
00:50:36,750 --> 00:50:39,333
Have sighting confirmed.
Stand by for fix.

490
00:50:39,375 --> 00:50:42,083
Contact in 16 minutes minus.

491
00:50:42,167 --> 00:50:45,417
Very precise estimate.
Who's on that unlisted flight?

492
00:50:48,042 --> 00:50:53,833
What happens now?
The carryall will come and
lift off the spice harvester.

493
00:50:53,917 --> 00:50:56,417
Try to get in close
over the harvester.

494
00:50:56,500 --> 00:51:01,292
You'll find this interesting, sire.
They'll work until the very last minute.

495
00:51:01,333 --> 00:51:03,917
Spotter control,
there's no sign of the carryall.

496
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:05,917
It isn't answering.

497
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:08,958
The worm is eight minutes away, sire.

498
00:51:09,042 --> 00:51:11,458
Spotter control,
give me a report by the numbers.

499
00:51:11,542 --> 00:51:14,208
Report One.
No contact.

500
00:51:14,292 --> 00:51:16,292
Report Two.
Negative.

501
00:51:16,375 --> 00:51:18,542
Report Three.
Negative, sir.

502
00:51:18,583 --> 00:51:22,250
Report Four.
No contact.

503
00:51:22,333 --> 00:51:24,250
I think they've got
our carryall.

504
00:51:24,333 --> 00:51:26,500
Damn it.
Harkonnens.

505
00:51:26,583 --> 00:51:31,292
We are coming down to take you
off the harvester. All spotters
are ordered to comply.

506
00:51:31,333 --> 00:51:33,875
Ordered by whom?
Duke Leto Atreides.

507
00:51:33,958 --> 00:51:37,458
Yes. Yes, sire.
How many men do you have?

508
00:51:37,542 --> 00:51:39,625
Full crew, 26 men.

509
00:51:39,667 --> 00:51:42,000
But, sire, we can't
leave all this spice.

510
00:51:42,042 --> 00:51:44,625
Damn the spice!
Get out of there!

511
00:51:54,167 --> 00:51:56,875
Two men in each of the spoilers!

512
00:51:56,917 --> 00:52:01,750
You, over here! Run! Run!

513
00:52:06,708 --> 00:52:09,333
I can't see him yet,
but he's very close.

514
00:52:09,417 --> 00:52:13,042
Damn sloppy.
Really damn sloppy.

515
00:52:13,125 --> 00:52:15,042
Come on, boys, come on!

516
00:52:18,250 --> 00:52:20,208
We're going to be heavy, sire.

517
00:52:20,292 --> 00:52:23,250
Spice.

518
00:52:23,333 --> 00:52:27,000
Pure, unrefined spice.

519
00:52:33,125 --> 00:52:35,542
Here it is! We've got to go!

520
00:52:44,792 --> 00:52:48,667
Bless the maker and his water.
Bless the coming and going of him.

521
00:52:48,750 --> 00:52:52,500
May his passing cleanse the world.
What's that you're saying?

522
00:52:52,583 --> 00:52:54,542
Nothing.

523
00:53:30,375 --> 00:53:32,542
Gods, what a monster!

524
00:53:41,292 --> 00:53:45,000
Someone is going to pay for this,
I promise.

525
00:53:47,875 --> 00:53:51,458
He's more concerned
over his men than the spice.

526
00:53:51,542 --> 00:53:56,083
I must admit,
against all better judgment,

527
00:53:56,167 --> 00:53:58,333
I like this duke.

528
00:54:43,875 --> 00:54:46,958
Milady, the local people,

529
00:54:47,042 --> 00:54:49,875
the maids and servants,
await your inspection.

530
00:54:49,958 --> 00:54:52,958
Hawat has cleared them.

531
00:54:55,833 --> 00:54:58,167
Excuse me, milady.

532
00:54:58,250 --> 00:55:02,625
The Harkonnens may have
tampered with them medically.

533
00:55:11,542 --> 00:55:13,583
When you said Harkonnens,

534
00:55:15,458 --> 00:55:18,167
I didn't know you had
so much reason to hate them.

535
00:55:21,875 --> 00:55:23,917
My wife...

536
00:55:25,458 --> 00:55:29,042
But of course, you didn't know my wife.

537
00:55:30,167 --> 00:55:32,167
The Hark...

538
00:55:32,250 --> 00:55:34,333
Forgive me.

539
00:55:34,417 --> 00:55:36,333
They must have killed her.

540
00:55:36,417 --> 00:55:40,875
Please excuse me
if I can't talk about it.

541
00:55:44,250 --> 00:55:46,792
He's holding something back.

542
00:55:46,875 --> 00:55:48,792
Yet...

543
00:55:48,875 --> 00:55:52,125
There's the Imperial Conditioning.

544
00:55:53,458 --> 00:55:55,417
Assurance of trust.

545
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:05,917
The Bene Gesserit mother. The legend.

546
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:09,000
Where is your son?

547
00:56:09,083 --> 00:56:12,917
I must warn you,
you are in great danger.

548
00:56:15,667 --> 00:56:17,583
Safe.

549
00:56:33,792 --> 00:56:35,875
Spice.

550
00:56:53,250 --> 00:56:55,208
What is it doing to me?

551
00:57:07,708 --> 00:57:09,667
Second moon.

552
00:57:11,167 --> 00:57:13,083
The sleeper must awaken.

553
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:16,042
Am I the one?

554
00:57:29,292 --> 00:57:31,750
A hunter seeker.

555
00:57:31,833 --> 00:57:33,833
Can't get me if I don't move.

556
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:38,625
It's too dark in here
for it to see clearly.

557
00:57:53,958 --> 00:57:56,708
I've got to try to grab it.

558
00:57:56,792 --> 00:57:59,458
Suspensor field will make it
slippery on the bottom.

559
00:57:59,542 --> 00:58:03,375
I must grip it tightly.

560
00:58:03,417 --> 00:58:06,208
Who is operating that thing?

561
00:58:06,292 --> 00:58:10,250
It has to be someone
in the palace.

562
00:58:10,292 --> 00:58:14,583
I could shout for help, but it would
kill whoever opened the door.

563
00:58:31,375 --> 00:58:35,042
Hold still.

564
00:58:57,042 --> 00:59:01,000
It would have killed me.

565
00:59:01,042 --> 00:59:05,125
I was its target.
It went to the motion.

566
00:59:05,208 --> 00:59:07,292
Who are you?

567
00:59:07,375 --> 00:59:11,917
I am the Shadout Mapes,
the housekeeper.

568
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:15,833
I must cleanse
the way between us.

569
00:59:15,917 --> 00:59:20,583
You saved my life,
and we Fremen pay our debts.

570
00:59:20,667 --> 00:59:22,833
A Fremen.

571
00:59:22,917 --> 00:59:26,667
It is known to us that you've
a traitor in your midst.

572
00:59:26,750 --> 00:59:29,208
Who it is, we cannot say.

573
00:59:29,292 --> 00:59:32,375
But we are certain of it.

574
00:59:41,708 --> 00:59:43,625
A traitor.

575
00:59:43,708 --> 00:59:47,250
Let's go, guys!

576
00:59:54,375 --> 00:59:57,958
Set up a sonar probe immediately.

577
00:59:58,042 --> 01:00:01,458
Over here!

578
01:00:05,958 --> 01:00:07,875
Harkonnen.

579
01:00:10,750 --> 01:00:14,375
They have tried
to take the life of my son.

580
01:00:18,292 --> 01:00:21,292
Sector six through 8O,
progress reports, sire.

581
01:00:21,375 --> 01:00:23,792
Take it, Thufir.

582
01:00:25,625 --> 01:00:28,042
Sector six, 8O, copy the sixth,
the sum of the eighth,

583
01:00:28,125 --> 01:00:31,042
the quadrant over the ninth,
plus 8O, four circles,

584
01:00:31,042 --> 01:00:32,500
weave the 8O and call the fourth.

585
01:00:32,542 --> 01:00:34,000
Copy.

586
01:00:38,042 --> 01:00:42,083
Eight, Thufir Hawat,
Mentat, Master of Assassins.

587
01:00:43,167 --> 01:00:47,792
The, uh, the palace
is now secure.

588
01:00:47,875 --> 01:00:51,625
The city of Arrakeen
is under martial law.

589
01:00:51,708 --> 01:00:56,417
We have troops here,
headquartered underground,

590
01:00:56,458 --> 01:00:58,667
on subfloors six through ten.

591
01:00:58,750 --> 01:01:01,458
The rest of the troops
are stationed in Arrakeen,

592
01:01:01,500 --> 01:01:03,958
and we have some
on the airfield.

593
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:06,417
Our new army
is still in training,

594
01:01:06,500 --> 01:01:09,000
but everything,
everything is shielded,

595
01:01:09,083 --> 01:01:12,875
and with this shielding,
we are impenetrable.

596
01:02:05,292 --> 01:02:07,958
Sleep well, my son.

597
01:02:20,625 --> 01:02:24,208
Father... drugged.

598
01:02:30,917 --> 01:02:33,458
Jessica, what is wrong?

599
01:02:33,542 --> 01:02:36,792
Forgive me,
my beloved concubine.

600
01:02:36,833 --> 01:02:40,542
I should have married you.

601
01:02:40,625 --> 01:02:46,208
Why hold a dream to ascend to a throne
through a political marriage?

602
01:02:46,292 --> 01:02:49,000
I should have married you.

603
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:15,958
What happened?

604
01:03:36,542 --> 01:03:38,458
Yueh!

605
01:03:38,542 --> 01:03:42,708
He sabotaged the house generators.
We are wide open!

606
01:03:46,292 --> 01:03:49,792
House shield deactivating.

607
01:03:49,833 --> 01:03:52,458
I've destroyed the new army's
weirding modules.

608
01:03:52,500 --> 01:03:55,333
I've brought
House Atreides down.

609
01:03:55,417 --> 01:03:58,042
Why?
I wish to kill a man.

610
01:03:58,125 --> 01:04:03,042
Not you, my dear Duke.
You were already dead.

611
01:04:03,125 --> 01:04:06,292
But you'll get close
to the baron before you die.

612
01:04:06,375 --> 01:04:09,917
You'll be tied and drugged,
but you can still attack.

613
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:12,417
You can still attack!

614
01:04:12,500 --> 01:04:15,333
When you see the baron,

615
01:04:15,417 --> 01:04:19,000
you'll have
a new poison gas tooth.

616
01:04:19,083 --> 01:04:23,000
He'll want you close
so he can gloat over you.

617
01:04:23,083 --> 01:04:26,042
One bite on this tooth,

618
01:04:26,125 --> 01:04:28,500
and a strong exhale...

619
01:04:28,542 --> 01:04:31,875
Refuse.
No, you mustn't!

620
01:04:31,917 --> 01:04:37,375
Because, in return, I'll save
the lives of your Paul and Jessica.

621
01:04:42,750 --> 01:04:44,708
For Paul.

622
01:04:48,292 --> 01:04:50,208
Oh!

623
01:04:59,458 --> 01:05:03,167
When you see the baron,
remember the tooth.

624
01:05:03,208 --> 01:05:06,958
The tooth. The tooth!

625
01:05:07,042 --> 01:05:11,000
The shield is down!
The shield is down!

626
01:05:13,125 --> 01:05:15,458
Open the doors!

627
01:05:15,542 --> 01:05:17,542
Signals!

628
01:05:19,125 --> 01:05:23,750
Get that shield up!
The shield! The shield!

629
01:05:47,958 --> 01:05:50,917
The weirding modules. Destroyed!

630
01:06:39,125 --> 01:06:42,000
Long live Duke Leto!

631
01:07:04,583 --> 01:07:07,292
The drug was timed.

632
01:07:09,292 --> 01:07:13,417
Dr. Yueh has been
very valuable to us.

633
01:07:15,625 --> 01:07:19,792
What a pity
you must remain gagged.

634
01:07:19,875 --> 01:07:24,792
We can't let ourselves be swayed
by your witch's voice now, can we?

635
01:07:24,875 --> 01:07:28,125
Leto, where are you?

636
01:07:29,917 --> 01:07:32,458
How simple to subdue us.

637
01:07:45,417 --> 01:07:48,208
Good-bye, Jessica.

638
01:07:48,292 --> 01:07:51,333
And good-bye
to your sweet son.

639
01:07:51,375 --> 01:07:54,292
I want to spit once on your head.

640
01:07:54,375 --> 01:07:57,583
Just some spittle in your face.

641
01:08:00,500 --> 01:08:02,833
What a luxury.

642
01:08:08,125 --> 01:08:10,958
We were ordered
to kill them, so kill them.

643
01:08:14,708 --> 01:08:17,667
I wish this was Paul.

644
01:08:24,292 --> 01:08:26,833
I knew Yueh's wife.

645
01:08:28,792 --> 01:08:32,542
I was the one who broke
his Imperial Conditioning.

646
01:08:37,417 --> 01:08:40,542
I've thought of many pleasures
with you.

647
01:08:42,125 --> 01:08:47,083
It is perhaps better that you die
in the innards of a worm.

648
01:08:56,708 --> 01:09:00,083
What are your orders, Piter?

649
01:09:00,167 --> 01:09:04,083
Take them to the desert
as the traitor suggested.

650
01:09:04,167 --> 01:09:07,167
The worms will destroy the evidence.

651
01:09:07,250 --> 01:09:10,125
Their bodies must never be found.

652
01:09:23,958 --> 01:09:26,917
They're down on this floor somewhere.
Down there.

653
01:09:46,250 --> 01:09:48,250
Duncan!

654
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:02,500
You wish now to join your wife?
Is that it, traitor?

655
01:10:02,583 --> 01:10:04,542
She lives?

656
01:10:04,583 --> 01:10:07,458
You wish to join her?

657
01:10:10,583 --> 01:10:12,542
Join her.

658
01:10:19,542 --> 01:10:22,708
You think you've defeated me?

659
01:10:25,625 --> 01:10:30,250
You think I don't know what
I gained... for my wife?

660
01:10:36,583 --> 01:10:38,542
Take him away.

661
01:11:00,125 --> 01:11:02,583
Yueh's sign.

662
01:11:05,333 --> 01:11:09,167
He's left us stillsuits.

663
01:11:16,042 --> 01:11:18,792
Don't touch my mother!

664
01:11:18,875 --> 01:11:20,792
He's trying the Voice.

665
01:11:20,875 --> 01:11:22,875
The Reverend Mother
said it could save him.

666
01:11:22,917 --> 01:11:24,917
Did you hear a noise
from the little one?

667
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:29,375
Huh? I didn't hear anything.

668
01:11:31,750 --> 01:11:34,750
The little one.

669
01:11:47,125 --> 01:11:49,167
Remove her gag.

670
01:11:49,250 --> 01:11:51,333
Excellent.

671
01:11:51,417 --> 01:11:56,167
Remove her gag.

672
01:11:56,250 --> 01:11:59,917
Remove her gag.

673
01:12:06,958 --> 01:12:10,167
There's no need to fight over me.

674
01:12:10,250 --> 01:12:14,083
There's no need to fight...

675
01:12:21,167 --> 01:12:23,542
A poisoned blade.

676
01:12:31,375 --> 01:12:37,125
First... cut my son's bonds.

677
01:12:44,542 --> 01:12:47,625
That's it.

678
01:12:59,333 --> 01:13:01,500
Oh, my God!

679
01:13:10,833 --> 01:13:13,250
It's under control.

680
01:13:41,250 --> 01:13:45,875
Duke Leto Atreides.

681
01:13:49,458 --> 01:13:53,208
Where is the ducal signet ring?

682
01:13:53,292 --> 01:13:56,500
I must have his ring.

683
01:13:58,667 --> 01:14:01,208
The ring!

684
01:14:03,167 --> 01:14:05,833
He was brought to us
as is, my lord Baron.

685
01:14:08,583 --> 01:14:12,042
You killed the doctor
too soon, you fool!

686
01:14:12,083 --> 01:14:16,375
The doctor, Yueh. What did he say?

687
01:14:16,458 --> 01:14:21,000
Paul and Jessica safe.
Yes! The tooth!

688
01:14:21,083 --> 01:14:23,458
He's coming around, Baron.

689
01:14:23,542 --> 01:14:26,292
Where's your ring?

690
01:14:26,375 --> 01:14:29,625
Huh? You do not answer?

691
01:14:29,708 --> 01:14:31,958
Wait. Wait.

692
01:14:32,042 --> 01:14:35,083
You must come closer.

693
01:14:35,167 --> 01:14:37,833
The water...

694
01:14:37,875 --> 01:14:40,667
of my life...

695
01:14:40,708 --> 01:14:43,000
for Paul.

696
01:14:43,042 --> 01:14:47,250
He's crying. He's crying!

697
01:14:47,333 --> 01:14:50,292
What does that mean, Piter?

698
01:14:52,458 --> 01:14:56,250
Come closer, Baron.

699
01:15:03,458 --> 01:15:06,958
Jessica! Paul!

700
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:11,208
Leto! Leto, he's dead!

701
01:15:11,292 --> 01:15:14,583
Oh, he's dead!

702
01:15:14,667 --> 01:15:17,708
I know.

703
01:15:23,792 --> 01:15:26,292
Am I alive?

704
01:15:27,750 --> 01:15:30,417
I'm alive?
Yes.

705
01:15:30,500 --> 01:15:33,708
You're alive, my Baron.

706
01:15:33,792 --> 01:15:36,250
I'm alive, eh?

707
01:15:36,333 --> 01:15:40,167
I'm alive!
I am alive!

708
01:15:40,250 --> 01:15:43,958
I'm alive!

709
01:15:50,792 --> 01:15:53,000
I can't maintain any altitude.

710
01:15:53,042 --> 01:15:56,500
We'll never reach the safety of rock.

711
01:15:59,750 --> 01:16:01,917
Maybe that small rock.

712
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:04,125
Where are we,
do you think?

713
01:16:04,208 --> 01:16:08,292
The south polar regions.
The forbidden area.

714
01:16:08,375 --> 01:16:11,167
Hold on.

715
01:16:19,042 --> 01:16:21,000
Hurry!

716
01:16:23,042 --> 01:16:25,333
Take the stillsuits.

717
01:16:26,458 --> 01:16:29,375
Hurry! This crash
might bring a worm.

718
01:16:35,083 --> 01:16:37,000
The signet.

719
01:16:37,083 --> 01:16:40,375
A million deaths
are not enough for Yueh.

720
01:17:02,750 --> 01:17:07,042
Where are my feelings?
I feel for no one.

721
01:17:11,583 --> 01:17:13,958
The second moon.

722
01:17:28,917 --> 01:17:32,500
I mean Paul Atreides.

723
01:17:32,542 --> 01:17:35,042
We want him killed.

724
01:17:35,125 --> 01:17:39,375
Why? Why do they want me killed?

725
01:17:39,417 --> 01:17:43,417
It has to be something
to do with the spice.

726
01:17:43,500 --> 01:17:45,542
But what?

727
01:17:50,833 --> 01:17:55,208
He who controls the spice
controls the universe!

728
01:18:02,917 --> 01:18:06,042
This moon holds my future.

729
01:18:18,792 --> 01:18:22,375
Never one drop of rain on Arrakis.

730
01:18:25,625 --> 01:18:29,417
The sleeper must awaken.

731
01:18:37,958 --> 01:18:42,250
They will call me Muad'Dib.

732
01:18:48,958 --> 01:18:52,792
Listen to me. Listen.

733
01:18:52,875 --> 01:18:55,875
You wanted to know
about my dreams.

734
01:18:55,958 --> 01:18:58,750
Well, I've just had a waking dream.

735
01:18:58,833 --> 01:19:01,583
Do you know why?

736
01:19:01,667 --> 01:19:05,750
The spice!
It's in everything here.

737
01:19:05,833 --> 01:19:07,958
Calm yourself.

738
01:19:08,042 --> 01:19:13,083
Like the Truthsayer drug.
It's a poison.

739
01:19:13,167 --> 01:19:17,083
You knew the spice
would change me.

740
01:19:17,167 --> 01:19:21,625
But thanks to your teachings,
it's changing my consciousness.

741
01:19:21,708 --> 01:19:24,417
I see it!
I can see it!

742
01:19:24,500 --> 01:19:27,125
Is he the one?

743
01:19:27,208 --> 01:19:30,958
You carry my unborn sister
in your womb.

744
01:19:31,042 --> 01:19:33,583
He knows.

745
01:19:43,625 --> 01:19:45,542
Father!

746
01:19:49,167 --> 01:19:55,083
Father, I promise one day
the sleeper will awaken,

747
01:19:55,125 --> 01:19:58,958
and I will avenge your death.

748
01:19:59,042 --> 01:20:04,875
I will not stop until I destroy
the emperor and the baron.

749
01:20:09,958 --> 01:20:11,875
Father.

750
01:20:26,917 --> 01:20:30,583
Go now.

751
01:20:30,625 --> 01:20:34,792
Take him to his desert...
to die.

752
01:20:34,875 --> 01:20:37,917
Go.

753
01:21:09,625 --> 01:21:12,542
Yueh's left the plan
for the weirding modules.

754
01:21:23,875 --> 01:21:27,000
We have to get to
that mountain of rock.

755
01:21:27,042 --> 01:21:31,458
We have entered the time when all
will turn against us and seek our lives.

756
01:21:47,875 --> 01:21:50,833
It's further than I thought.

757
01:21:50,917 --> 01:21:53,542
A worm is sure to come.

758
01:21:55,417 --> 01:21:58,875
I'll plant this thumper.
That should divert it.

759
01:22:26,875 --> 01:22:30,042
Remember, walk without rhythm,

760
01:22:30,125 --> 01:22:32,042
and we won't attract a worm.

761
01:22:32,083 --> 01:22:34,375
It will go to the thumper.

762
01:22:35,875 --> 01:22:37,917
I'm ready.

763
01:23:18,750 --> 01:23:20,958
Faster!

764
01:23:21,042 --> 01:23:24,333
It's deafening!

765
01:24:39,667 --> 01:24:42,417
The spice.

766
01:24:44,375 --> 01:24:47,208
Do you smell it?
Yes!

767
01:24:54,875 --> 01:24:57,208
Paul!

768
01:25:12,208 --> 01:25:14,167
Paul!

769
01:25:23,875 --> 01:25:26,667
A thumper.

770
01:25:35,125 --> 01:25:39,542
The worm! Spice!
Is there a relationship?

771
01:25:52,583 --> 01:25:55,000
What's happened?

772
01:25:55,042 --> 01:25:58,042
Why did it leave?

773
01:25:58,125 --> 01:26:01,667
Someone started
another thumper.

774
01:26:01,750 --> 01:26:04,750
We're not alone.

775
01:26:34,875 --> 01:26:36,792
Man-carved steps.

776
01:26:36,875 --> 01:26:38,792
Yes.

777
01:26:51,542 --> 01:26:54,000
Such stealth.

778
01:26:54,042 --> 01:26:56,000
I didn't hear them.

779
01:26:56,083 --> 01:26:59,458
Perhaps these are the ones
the Shadout Mapes told us of.

780
01:26:59,542 --> 01:27:02,000
I will take the boy-man.

781
01:27:02,042 --> 01:27:05,042
He shall have sanctuary
in my tribe.

782
01:27:12,958 --> 01:27:15,083
Stop! Get back!

783
01:27:15,167 --> 01:27:17,625
She has the weirding way.

784
01:27:20,042 --> 01:27:22,125
Great gods!

785
01:27:22,208 --> 01:27:25,125
If you can do this
to the strongest of us,

786
01:27:25,167 --> 01:27:28,167
you're worth ten times
your weight of water.

787
01:27:30,625 --> 01:27:34,833
As the leader of my people,
I give you my bond.

788
01:27:34,875 --> 01:27:37,542
Teach us this weirding way,

789
01:27:37,625 --> 01:27:41,125
and you both
shall have sanctuary.

790
01:27:41,208 --> 01:27:44,625
Your water shall mingle
with our water.

791
01:27:44,708 --> 01:27:48,625
Then I will teach you
our way of battle.

792
01:27:52,583 --> 01:27:55,750
I give you the word bond
of a Bene Gesserit.

793
01:27:55,833 --> 01:27:57,958
It is the legend.

794
01:28:03,833 --> 01:28:07,500
I am Chani,
daughter of Liet.

795
01:28:07,542 --> 01:28:12,208
I would not have permitted you
to harm my tribe.

796
01:28:12,250 --> 01:28:17,917
From my dreams. So beautiful.

797
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:21,333
Come with me.
I'll show you an easier way down.

798
01:28:39,833 --> 01:28:42,792
You have strength.

799
01:28:42,875 --> 01:28:45,417
You shall be known as Usul,

800
01:28:45,500 --> 01:28:48,208
which is the strength
of the base of the pillar.

801
01:28:48,292 --> 01:28:51,333
This is your secret name
in our troop,

802
01:28:51,417 --> 01:28:54,708
but you must choose
the name of manhood...

803
01:28:54,792 --> 01:28:57,958
which we will call you openly.

804
01:29:00,292 --> 01:29:03,625
What do you call the mouse shadow
in the second moon?

805
01:29:05,708 --> 01:29:09,500
We call that one Muad'Dib.

806
01:29:09,583 --> 01:29:12,958
Could I be known
as Paul Muad'Dib?

807
01:29:13,042 --> 01:29:16,667
You are Paul Muad'Dib.

808
01:29:16,708 --> 01:29:21,167
And your mother shall be
a Sayyadina among us.

809
01:29:21,250 --> 01:29:24,042
We welcome you.

810
01:29:24,083 --> 01:29:27,500
A dream unfolds.

811
01:29:45,542 --> 01:29:49,167
Moisture!

812
01:29:49,250 --> 01:29:53,208
Wind traps.
Huge ones.

813
01:30:03,375 --> 01:30:05,500
Water.

814
01:30:05,583 --> 01:30:08,417
Millions of decaliters.

815
01:30:08,500 --> 01:30:10,917
A treasure.

816
01:30:11,000 --> 01:30:13,708
Greater than treasure, Usul.

817
01:30:13,792 --> 01:30:17,292
We have thousands
of such caches,

818
01:30:18,708 --> 01:30:21,542
and only a few of us
know them all.

819
01:30:21,625 --> 01:30:24,542
And when we have enough,

820
01:30:24,625 --> 01:30:28,500
we shall change
the face of Arrakis.

821
01:30:48,250 --> 01:30:51,292
Tell me of your home world, Usul.

822
01:30:53,333 --> 01:30:56,208
"Tell me of your home world, Usul".

823
01:31:32,583 --> 01:31:36,292
Rabban! Rabban!

824
01:31:38,208 --> 01:31:42,417
We're knee-deep in Atreides blood.
We've gutted them!

825
01:31:42,458 --> 01:31:46,333
We've gutted them!

826
01:31:49,000 --> 01:31:51,500
Rabban. Rabban!

827
01:31:53,583 --> 01:31:56,000
I place you in charge of Arrakis.

828
01:31:56,083 --> 01:31:59,042
It's yours to squeeze
as I promised.

829
01:31:59,083 --> 01:32:03,375
I want you to squeeze
and squeeze and squeeze!

830
01:32:03,417 --> 01:32:05,500
Give me spice!

831
01:32:05,583 --> 01:32:08,708
Drive them! Drive them
into utter submission!

832
01:32:08,750 --> 01:32:12,000
Do not show the slightest pity
or mercy!

833
01:32:12,083 --> 01:32:16,042
Never stop! Go! Go!
Show no mercy!

834
01:32:16,125 --> 01:32:18,500
Yes, Baron.

835
01:32:38,042 --> 01:32:40,000
Feyd.

836
01:32:50,083 --> 01:32:54,500
And when
we've crushed these people enough,

837
01:32:54,583 --> 01:32:58,917
I'll send you, Feyd.

838
01:33:02,417 --> 01:33:05,125
Lovely Feyd.

839
01:33:11,083 --> 01:33:14,375
Where's my doctor?

840
01:33:20,958 --> 01:33:23,458
Jessica...

841
01:33:23,542 --> 01:33:26,958
our Reverend Mother is too old.

842
01:33:27,000 --> 01:33:30,125
She has been calling
through space and time...

843
01:33:30,167 --> 01:33:33,792
for you to come
and let her rest.

844
01:33:33,875 --> 01:33:39,500
She asks that you pass within
and become our Reverend Mother.

845
01:33:41,250 --> 01:33:45,208
If you be a Reverend Mother...

846
01:33:47,583 --> 01:33:51,542
Iet Shai-Halud judge now!

847
01:33:54,750 --> 01:33:56,667
The Water of Life.

848
01:33:59,625 --> 01:34:03,792
But what of my unborn child?

849
01:34:03,833 --> 01:34:07,333
One day, I will have to do this.

850
01:34:24,167 --> 01:34:27,125
Following the Bene Gesserit tradition,

851
01:34:27,167 --> 01:34:29,667
the old Reverend Mother
surrendered her life...

852
01:34:29,750 --> 01:34:32,750
as she surrendered her knowledge.

853
01:34:32,833 --> 01:34:38,125
Jessica had successfully transmuted
the poisonous Water of Life.

854
01:34:38,167 --> 01:34:42,708
Every man who has tried has died.

855
01:34:42,792 --> 01:34:44,792
Am I the one?

856
01:34:44,875 --> 01:34:49,167
The sleeper must awaken.

857
01:34:53,042 --> 01:34:55,125
The tremendous power
of the Water of Life...

858
01:34:55,208 --> 01:34:58,708
caused the premature birth
of Jessica's daughter, Alia.

859
01:34:58,792 --> 01:35:03,292
Alia was born with all the knowledge
and powers of a Reverend Mother.

860
01:35:18,333 --> 01:35:21,458
Feyd, even though he's aging,

861
01:35:21,542 --> 01:35:25,417
Thufir's one of the finest Mentats
in the universe.

862
01:35:25,500 --> 01:35:29,917
And he's mine, Feyd, all mine.

863
01:35:33,500 --> 01:35:35,917
Try it now.
I will.

864
01:35:35,958 --> 01:35:37,917
Come.

865
01:35:50,708 --> 01:35:52,958
Oh, Thufir!

866
01:35:53,042 --> 01:35:56,625
I see they've installed
your heart plug already.

867
01:35:56,708 --> 01:36:00,958
Don't be angry.
Everyone gets one here.

868
01:36:01,042 --> 01:36:04,292
But this is not
why we're here.

869
01:36:04,375 --> 01:36:07,458
We brought you
a little cat, Thufir.

870
01:36:07,542 --> 01:36:10,458
You must care for it
if you wish to live.

871
01:36:12,542 --> 01:36:16,583
A poison has been introduced
into your body, Thufir Hawat.

872
01:36:16,667 --> 01:36:20,417
By milking this,
this smooth little cat's body,

873
01:36:20,500 --> 01:36:22,750
you receive your antidote.

874
01:36:22,833 --> 01:36:24,917
It must be done each day.

875
01:36:27,208 --> 01:36:30,250
All I can see...

876
01:36:30,333 --> 01:36:33,458
is an Atreides
that I want to kill.

877
01:36:33,542 --> 01:36:37,417
Feyd! No, no!

878
01:36:37,500 --> 01:36:42,583
Thufir's a Harkonnen now.
Aren't you, Thufir?

879
01:36:42,667 --> 01:36:46,875
My duke! How I've failed you.

880
01:37:05,542 --> 01:37:08,708
Chani, I love you.

881
01:37:08,750 --> 01:37:11,417
I've always loved you.

882
01:37:35,500 --> 01:37:38,917
The Holy Warriors.

883
01:37:39,000 --> 01:37:42,500
No one ever dreamed
there were so many.

884
01:37:42,583 --> 01:37:47,667
I am Usul.
Paul Muad'Dib.

885
01:37:50,917 --> 01:37:54,125
Our shared enemy, the Harkonnens,

886
01:37:54,167 --> 01:37:57,625
are once again
in control of Arrakis.

887
01:37:57,667 --> 01:38:01,958
Stilgar, your leader,
has asked me and my mother...

888
01:38:02,042 --> 01:38:06,458
to teach you the weirding way
to crush the Harkonnens.

889
01:38:06,542 --> 01:38:09,292
We must do more than this.

890
01:38:09,375 --> 01:38:13,333
We must totally destroy
all spice production on Arrakis.

891
01:38:15,042 --> 01:38:19,125
The Guild and the entire universe
depends on spice.

892
01:38:19,208 --> 01:38:23,167
He who can destroy a thing
controls a thing.

893
01:38:23,250 --> 01:38:27,333
I will take 100 of your warriors
and train them.

894
01:38:27,417 --> 01:38:31,458
This 100 will train
the thousands that remain.

895
01:38:31,500 --> 01:38:36,958
When the spice flow stops,
all eyes will turn to Arrakis.

896
01:38:37,042 --> 01:38:39,375
The baron
and the emperor himself...

897
01:38:39,458 --> 01:38:41,958
will be forced to deal with us.

898
01:38:44,417 --> 01:38:49,125
Arrakis will become
the center of the universe.

899
01:38:51,292 --> 01:38:53,292
Orato!

900
01:38:56,458 --> 01:39:01,000
This obelisk
is of your hardest stone.

901
01:39:01,083 --> 01:39:03,250
Kick it.

902
01:39:09,375 --> 01:39:11,500
Hit it.

903
01:39:15,583 --> 01:39:19,625
Yell at it.

904
01:39:22,750 --> 01:39:24,708
Break!

905
01:39:27,042 --> 01:39:29,875
Korba... cut it.

906
01:39:42,500 --> 01:39:44,833
Move back.

907
01:40:09,208 --> 01:40:12,333
Muad'Dib!

908
01:40:12,417 --> 01:40:17,083
This is part of the weirding way
that we will teach you.

909
01:40:19,208 --> 01:40:23,083
Some thoughts
have a certain sound,

910
01:40:23,167 --> 01:40:25,875
that being the equivalent
to a form.

911
01:40:25,958 --> 01:40:29,125
Through sound and motion...

912
01:40:29,208 --> 01:40:33,250
you will be able to paralyze nerves,
shatter bones,

913
01:40:33,292 --> 01:40:37,708
set fires, suffocate an enemy
or burst his organs.

914
01:40:37,792 --> 01:40:42,667
We will kill until no Harkonnen
breathes Arrakeen air.

915
01:40:42,750 --> 01:40:45,167
Muad'Dib!

916
01:40:55,708 --> 01:40:57,917
Stilgar!

917
01:40:59,667 --> 01:41:01,583
Muad'Dib!
Hmm?

918
01:41:01,667 --> 01:41:03,917
Muad'Dib. Muad'Dib. Muad'Dib.

919
01:41:08,875 --> 01:41:12,042
My name is a killing word.

920
01:41:12,125 --> 01:41:14,500
They are ready to fight.

921
01:41:14,583 --> 01:41:18,250
Yet in order to lead them,
I must conquer the worm.

922
01:41:18,333 --> 01:41:19,542
Conquer Shai-Halud.

923
01:41:19,542 --> 01:41:20,958
Conquer Shai-Halud.

924
01:41:29,125 --> 01:41:32,458
Take the kiswa maker hook
of our sietch...

925
01:41:32,542 --> 01:41:35,458
and ride as a leader of men.

926
01:41:48,083 --> 01:41:53,708
Shai-Halud.

927
01:42:33,833 --> 01:42:37,875
I must not fear.
Fear is the mind killer.

928
01:42:45,042 --> 01:42:48,833
Only the very strong ones
travel this deep.

929
01:42:48,917 --> 01:42:52,250
Usul has called a big one!

930
01:42:52,333 --> 01:42:55,292
Again, it is the legend.

931
01:44:31,583 --> 01:44:33,458
Look!

932
01:44:33,542 --> 01:44:35,958
Muad'Dib!

933
01:45:08,042 --> 01:45:11,792
Usul, these are 15
of our finest warriors...

934
01:45:11,875 --> 01:45:15,417
to serve you as your guard.

935
01:45:20,000 --> 01:45:22,208
The Fedaykin.

936
01:45:35,417 --> 01:45:37,333
Now.

937
01:46:01,875 --> 01:46:06,458
When the spice flow stops,
all eyes will turn to Arrakis.

938
01:46:06,542 --> 01:46:10,958
The baron and the emperor himself
will be forced to deal with us.

939
01:46:14,458 --> 01:46:19,042
Muad'Dib. Muad'Dib.
Muad'Dib. Muad'Dib.

940
01:46:19,125 --> 01:46:22,958
What happened?
What happened to you and your men?

941
01:46:23,000 --> 01:46:26,250
Muad'Dib. Muad'Dib.
What are you saying?

942
01:46:26,333 --> 01:46:28,750
Muad'Dib. Muad'Dib. Muad'Dib.
What?

943
01:46:30,833 --> 01:46:33,792
He's been repeating that name
ever since we found him.

944
01:46:33,875 --> 01:46:39,333
Who is this... Muad'Dib?

945
01:46:45,167 --> 01:46:48,750
In the two standard years that followed,

946
01:46:48,833 --> 01:46:52,917
Muad'Dib and the Fremen brought
spice production to a standstill.

947
01:46:53,000 --> 01:46:56,042
Fearing for his life,
Rabban did his best...

948
01:46:56,125 --> 01:46:59,792
to hide this fact
from his uncle, the baron.

949
01:47:06,042 --> 01:47:09,542
Paul's sister, Alia,
matured at a frightening rate.

950
01:47:09,625 --> 01:47:12,958
Her small body
harbored tremendous powers.

951
01:47:13,042 --> 01:47:16,333
Paul and Chani's love grew.

952
01:47:21,625 --> 01:47:23,917
We surprised
a band of smugglers.

953
01:47:23,958 --> 01:47:27,542
Too bad.
I thought they were Harkonnen.

954
01:47:37,833 --> 01:47:39,833
Gurney!

955
01:47:42,333 --> 01:47:46,083
You've no need of your weapons
with me, Gurney Halleck.

956
01:47:46,167 --> 01:47:49,750
Paul? Paul?

957
01:47:49,833 --> 01:47:51,917
Don't you trust
your own eyes?

958
01:47:52,000 --> 01:47:54,417
They said you were dead.

959
01:47:56,500 --> 01:47:59,458
They... they said...

960
01:48:03,083 --> 01:48:06,042
Gurney! Gurney man!

961
01:48:06,125 --> 01:48:09,375
You young pup! You young pup!
Gurney!

962
01:48:25,667 --> 01:48:28,708
Emperor Shaddam the Fourth,

963
01:48:28,792 --> 01:48:32,917
you have one last chance
to take matters into your own hands...

964
01:48:33,000 --> 01:48:36,167
and bring the situation
under control on Arrakis.

965
01:48:36,250 --> 01:48:39,042
What do you mean one last...
Silence! Do not speak!

966
01:48:39,125 --> 01:48:42,833
Listen! You do not have
more than this one chance.

967
01:48:42,917 --> 01:48:45,875
I represent the entire Guild
in this matter.

968
01:48:45,917 --> 01:48:49,417
Our navigators warn you that
spice production is in great danger.

969
01:48:49,500 --> 01:48:54,333
A new Fremen leader, Muad'Dib,
has stopped spice mining on Arrakis.

970
01:48:54,417 --> 01:48:58,333
Our navigators suggest
he is not of Arrakis.

971
01:48:58,417 --> 01:49:01,583
No one on the outside world
has been able to see him.

972
01:49:01,667 --> 01:49:03,625
We do not know who he is.

973
01:49:03,708 --> 01:49:06,208
The Harkonnens
cannot stop him.

974
01:49:06,292 --> 01:49:10,000
Remedy the situation,
restore spice production,

975
01:49:10,083 --> 01:49:13,125
or you'll live out your life
in a pain amplifier.

976
01:49:21,542 --> 01:49:25,833
The emperor will stop him.
He won't take the Water of Life.

977
01:49:25,917 --> 01:49:28,333
That's why they want me killed.

978
01:49:28,417 --> 01:49:30,958
They're afraid I'll take
the Water of Life.

979
01:49:31,042 --> 01:49:35,000
I want 5O legions of Sardaukar
on Arrakis at once!

980
01:49:35,083 --> 01:49:38,750
Fifty legions?
That's our entire reserves as well.

981
01:49:38,792 --> 01:49:42,125
This is genocide: the deliberate
and systematic destruction...

982
01:49:42,167 --> 01:49:45,250
of all life on Arrakis!

983
01:49:46,583 --> 01:49:49,833
The emperor is coming. Chani! Chani!

984
01:49:52,417 --> 01:49:56,625
You were calling my name.
It frightened me.

985
01:49:56,708 --> 01:49:59,375
Oh, Chani.

986
01:49:59,458 --> 01:50:02,042
All the images
of my future are gone.

987
01:50:04,667 --> 01:50:07,208
I have to drink
the Water of Life.

988
01:50:07,292 --> 01:50:10,042
No. Paul. Please.

989
01:50:10,125 --> 01:50:12,042
I've seen the men
who have tried.

990
01:50:12,125 --> 01:50:14,083
I've seen how they died.

991
01:50:14,167 --> 01:50:16,083
I'm dead to everyone
unless I try...

992
01:50:16,167 --> 01:50:18,542
to become what I may be.

993
01:50:20,625 --> 01:50:23,250
Only the Water of Life
will free what can save us.

994
01:50:24,333 --> 01:50:26,292
Paul.

995
01:50:29,833 --> 01:50:32,875
I must drink the sacred water.

996
01:50:35,250 --> 01:50:37,667
We must go now.

997
01:51:31,667 --> 01:51:34,458
Hurry. All I see is darkness.

998
01:51:34,542 --> 01:51:36,458
Paul,

999
01:51:39,375 --> 01:51:41,333
I will love you forever.

1000
01:51:41,375 --> 01:51:44,958
You are my life.

1001
01:51:54,167 --> 01:51:56,083
You are my life.

1002
01:52:01,458 --> 01:52:04,750
Many men have tried.

1003
01:52:04,792 --> 01:52:06,792
They tried and failed?

1004
01:52:06,833 --> 01:52:08,792
They tried and died.

1005
01:52:17,375 --> 01:52:22,000
The worm is the spice.
The spice is the worm.

1006
01:52:41,500 --> 01:52:43,458
The worms.

1007
01:52:59,792 --> 01:53:02,500
They're not attacking. Why?

1008
01:53:21,417 --> 01:53:25,042
Alia.
Mother.

1009
01:53:27,458 --> 01:53:29,417
It's Paul.

1010
01:53:31,333 --> 01:53:35,750
He's taken the Water of Life.

1011
01:53:44,458 --> 01:53:46,667
There is a place...

1012
01:53:46,750 --> 01:53:51,125
terrifying to us, to women.

1013
01:53:51,167 --> 01:53:54,250
This is the place they cannot look.

1014
01:54:00,833 --> 01:54:03,917
Travelling without moving.

1015
01:54:05,292 --> 01:54:08,667
Now I truly control the worm...

1016
01:54:08,750 --> 01:54:12,042
and the spice.

1017
01:54:12,083 --> 01:54:17,250
And I have the power
to destroy the spice forever!

1018
01:54:45,750 --> 01:54:47,708
Paul.

1019
01:55:00,167 --> 01:55:02,083
Father!

1020
01:55:04,875 --> 01:55:09,833
Father, the sleeper has awakened!

1021
01:55:12,500 --> 01:55:18,125
Muad'Dib. Muad'Dib.

1022
01:55:18,208 --> 01:55:23,875
Muad'Dib. Muad'Dib.

1023
01:55:23,958 --> 01:55:27,917
Muad'Dib. Muad'Dib.

1024
01:55:28,000 --> 01:55:30,750
Arrakis.

1025
01:55:30,833 --> 01:55:34,667
Dune. Desert planet.

1026
01:55:34,708 --> 01:55:38,833
Your time has come.

1027
01:55:38,875 --> 01:55:41,542
A storm is coming.

1028
01:55:41,625 --> 01:55:44,208
Our storm.

1029
01:55:44,292 --> 01:55:49,167
And when it arrives
it will shake the universe.

1030
01:55:50,833 --> 01:55:54,667
Emperor, we come for you!

1031
01:55:56,208 --> 01:55:58,250
We come for you!

1032
01:56:11,583 --> 01:56:15,333
Long live the fighters!

1033
01:56:15,375 --> 01:56:19,750
Long live the fighters!

1034
01:56:50,375 --> 01:56:55,458
Suspicion confirmed:
The emperor's had Rabban seized.

1035
01:57:36,917 --> 01:57:39,667
Gurney, when the storm hits,
set off the atomics.

1036
01:57:41,167 --> 01:57:45,583
I want an opening through
the entire shield wall.

1037
01:57:45,625 --> 01:57:48,750
Stilgar, do we have wormsign?

1038
01:57:50,958 --> 01:57:55,833
Usul, we have wormsign the likes
of which even God has never seen.

1039
01:58:51,917 --> 01:58:54,667
Bring in that
floating fat man,

1040
01:58:54,750 --> 01:58:57,458
the baron.

1041
01:59:11,750 --> 01:59:13,708
Why have you brought me here?

1042
01:59:13,792 --> 01:59:16,417
Your Highness...

1043
01:59:16,500 --> 01:59:18,417
there must be some mistake.

1044
01:59:18,500 --> 01:59:21,292
I never requested your presence.

1045
01:59:21,375 --> 01:59:24,000
But your lack of action
demanded it.

1046
01:59:24,083 --> 01:59:26,542
Your dreadful mismanagement,
your bad judgment...

1047
01:59:26,625 --> 01:59:30,125
in assigning to Rabban
the governorship.

1048
01:59:30,208 --> 01:59:33,792
You've forced me to come here
and set things straight, personally!

1049
01:59:43,292 --> 01:59:48,208
I am a messenger from Muad'Dib.

1050
01:59:48,292 --> 01:59:50,875
Poor Emperor!

1051
01:59:50,917 --> 01:59:54,125
I'm afraid my brother
won't be very pleased with you.

1052
01:59:54,208 --> 01:59:58,208
Silence!
Kill this child. She's an abomination.

1053
01:59:58,292 --> 02:00:00,750
Kill her!

1054
02:00:00,792 --> 02:00:03,417
Get out of my mind!

1055
02:00:03,500 --> 02:00:09,125
Not until you
tell them both who I really am.

1056
02:00:09,208 --> 02:00:12,167
Alia.

1057
02:00:14,542 --> 02:00:17,875
Daughter of
Duke Leto the Just...

1058
02:00:17,917 --> 02:00:21,667
and the Royal Lady Jessica.

1059
02:00:21,750 --> 02:00:27,458
Sister of Paul Muad'Dib.

1060
02:00:27,542 --> 02:00:31,458
Paul's sister?
Paul is Muad'Dib?

1061
02:00:36,125 --> 02:00:38,625
Alia keeps pace
with the storm.

1062
02:00:43,042 --> 02:00:46,458
With the storm,
their air power will be useless.

1063
02:00:46,500 --> 02:00:49,625
On Arrakis,
it's desert power.

1064
02:00:49,708 --> 02:00:52,917
Gurney,

1065
02:00:53,000 --> 02:00:54,000
now!

1066
02:00:54,042 --> 02:00:56,375
Atomics!

1067
02:01:30,750 --> 02:01:32,500
My brother is coming...

1068
02:01:32,583 --> 02:01:35,750
with many Fremen warriors.

1069
02:01:35,833 --> 02:01:38,583
Impossible!

1070
02:01:38,625 --> 02:01:40,583
Not impossible!

1071
02:01:40,625 --> 02:01:44,500
I told you.
He is here now.

1072
02:01:50,917 --> 02:01:53,958
Father, today I will avenge your death.

1073
02:02:17,958 --> 02:02:21,250
Emperor, an impassable storm
has descended.

1074
02:02:21,333 --> 02:02:24,417
The shield wall
has been penetrated by atomics.

1075
02:02:26,167 --> 02:02:28,083
Release the Sardaukar!

1076
02:02:28,167 --> 02:02:33,125
Baron, give this
little abomination to the storm.

1077
02:02:33,208 --> 02:02:35,875
Wait for my brother, Baron.

1078
02:04:22,750 --> 02:04:24,917
Wait for my brother.

1079
02:04:38,833 --> 02:04:40,875
Muad'Dib!

1080
02:05:36,458 --> 02:05:37,750
Alia, now.

1081
02:05:37,833 --> 02:05:39,917
Come to me, Baron.

1082
02:06:53,250 --> 02:06:57,708
Muad'Dib.

1083
02:07:39,917 --> 02:07:42,333
Feyd Rautha.

1084
02:07:42,417 --> 02:07:45,625
Emperor Shaddam the Fourth,

1085
02:07:45,708 --> 02:07:47,917
there are Guild heighliners
above us...

1086
02:07:47,958 --> 02:07:50,125
containing many great
Houses of the Landsraad.

1087
02:07:50,167 --> 02:07:53,625
Send them back!
How dare you speak to me in that...

1088
02:07:53,708 --> 02:07:56,208
Stop your speaking!

1089
02:07:57,542 --> 02:08:00,542
You have some idea
of what I could do.

1090
02:08:02,708 --> 02:08:06,125
Don't try your powers on me.

1091
02:08:06,208 --> 02:08:09,167
Try looking into that place
where you dare not look.

1092
02:08:09,250 --> 02:08:11,250
You'll find me there
staring back at you.

1093
02:08:11,333 --> 02:08:13,458
You mustn't speak...
Silence!

1094
02:08:16,708 --> 02:08:20,292
I remember your gom jabbar.

1095
02:08:20,375 --> 02:08:23,917
Now you remember mine.
I can kill with a word.

1096
02:08:26,167 --> 02:08:29,792
And his word
shall carry death eternal...

1097
02:08:29,875 --> 02:08:31,958
to those who stand
against the righteous.

1098
02:08:32,042 --> 02:08:35,500
The righteous?
There is a Harkonnen among you.

1099
02:08:37,500 --> 02:08:40,042
Give the Harkonnen a blade,

1100
02:08:40,125 --> 02:08:42,083
and let him stand forth.

1101
02:08:42,125 --> 02:08:45,750
If Feyd wishes, he can meet you
with my blade in his hand.

1102
02:08:45,833 --> 02:08:49,792
I wish it.
This is a Harkonnen animal.

1103
02:08:49,833 --> 02:08:52,417
Let me.
Please, my lord.

1104
02:08:52,500 --> 02:08:55,000
The Emperor's blade.

1105
02:09:25,083 --> 02:09:27,792
Why prolong the inevitable?

1106
02:09:30,208 --> 02:09:32,500
I will kill you!

1107
02:09:47,917 --> 02:09:50,208
I will kill him!

1108
02:09:56,375 --> 02:09:57,042
Paul!

1109
02:09:58,625 --> 02:10:01,000
I will kill him!

1110
02:10:09,958 --> 02:10:12,458
Who is the little one?

1111
02:10:12,542 --> 02:10:14,917
A pet, perhaps?

1112
02:10:15,000 --> 02:10:17,375
Will she deserve
my special attentions?

1113
02:10:25,250 --> 02:10:27,167
Poisoned.

1114
02:10:29,000 --> 02:10:32,500
You see your death.

1115
02:10:32,583 --> 02:10:35,292
My blade will finish you.

1116
02:10:37,125 --> 02:10:41,708
I will bend like a reed in the wind.

1117
02:11:04,750 --> 02:11:06,292
Muad'Dib!

1118
02:11:06,375 --> 02:11:09,500
Usul no longer needs
the weirding module.

1119
02:11:09,542 --> 02:11:14,167
Muad'Dib had become the hand of God,

1120
02:11:14,250 --> 02:11:17,042
fulfilling the Fremen prophecy.

1121
02:11:17,125 --> 02:11:20,583
Where there was war,
Muad'Dib would now bring peace.

1122
02:11:20,625 --> 02:11:25,042
Where there was hatred,
Muad'Dib would bring love,

1123
02:11:25,125 --> 02:11:26,833
to lead the people
to true freedom,

1124
02:11:26,917 --> 02:11:30,792
and to change
the face of Arrakis.

1125
02:11:34,583 --> 02:11:36,500
We Fremen have a saying.

1126
02:11:36,583 --> 02:11:41,542
God created Arrakis
to train the faithful.

1127
02:11:41,625 --> 02:11:44,750
One cannot go against
the word of God.

1128
02:12:42,500 --> 02:12:45,292
And how can this be?

1129
02:12:46,875 --> 02:12:50,250
For he is the Kwisatz Haderach!
