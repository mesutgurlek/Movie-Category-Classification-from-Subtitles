1
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:51,100
Oh!

2
00:01:52,260 --> 00:01:53,330
Nozomi?

3
00:01:55,580 --> 00:01:56,620
Where am I?

4
00:01:57,830 --> 00:02:00,180
A candy store called Urahara’s Shop.

5
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:03,940
There’s nothing to worry about.

6
00:02:03,940 --> 00:02:05,140
It’s safe here.

7
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:12,190
Don’t strain yourself.

8
00:02:14,810 --> 00:02:15,550
Hey!

9
00:02:15,930 --> 00:02:17,760
You looked like you were 
having a nightmare.

10
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:18,650
Are you okay?

11
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:23,830
Hey! Are you listening?!

12
00:02:25,820 --> 00:02:27,340
What…is this?

13
00:02:27,340 --> 00:02:28,900
Oh, that’s right.

14
00:02:29,180 --> 00:02:31,830
You’ve never seen me like this.

15
00:02:32,150 --> 00:02:34,970
It’s me, Kon!

16
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:38,090
Hey, why were those guys after you?

17
00:02:38,090 --> 00:02:39,510
Is it because of something you did?

18
00:02:39,820 --> 00:02:41,090
Oh yeah, before we get to that…

19
00:02:41,090 --> 00:02:43,040
You are a Soul Reaper, aren’t you?

20
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:44,900
You should’ve said so.

21
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:48,430
Not to brag, but I’m pretty 
knowledgeable in that area.

22
00:02:48,430 --> 00:02:49,200
Lame.

23
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:51,720
That’s right, lame.

24
00:02:52,170 --> 00:02:53,520
Say what?!

25
00:02:53,810 --> 00:02:56,890
I’m not in this form by choice!

26
00:02:56,890 --> 00:02:58,690
I’m a Mod Soul,

27
00:02:58,690 --> 00:03:00,310
so when I can’t use Ichigo’s body,

28
00:03:00,310 --> 00:03:01,810
there’s nothing I can do about it!

29
00:03:02,350 --> 00:03:03,520
A Mod Soul?

30
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,790
T-That’s right.

31
00:03:12,270 --> 00:03:14,390
Wh-What’re you staring at?!

32
00:03:15,450 --> 00:03:19,990
Anyway, answer my questions!

33
00:03:19,990 --> 00:03:24,010
My loyal servants might 
be able to help you out.

34
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:32,520
Perverted freak.

35
00:03:33,070 --> 00:03:33,990
You jerk!

36
00:03:33,990 --> 00:03:35,800
What was that for?!

37
00:03:37,690 --> 00:03:39,170
That’s enough.

38
00:03:39,170 --> 00:03:40,410
But why?!

39
00:03:40,410 --> 00:03:43,070
All I did was ask her questions.

40
00:03:43,670 --> 00:03:45,160
If she doesn’t want to talk,

41
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:47,830
there’s no use trying 
to force it out of her.

42
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:50,480
But…

43
00:03:52,410 --> 00:03:53,290
Ichigo…

44
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:55,070
How long are you going to keep

45
00:03:55,070 --> 00:03:56,540
Brother and the others waiting?

46
00:03:57,270 --> 00:03:58,250
Come quickly!

47
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:00,760
All right. I’ll be right there.

48
00:04:01,020 --> 00:04:02,070
All right then!

49
00:04:02,070 --> 00:04:04,870
Off we go to the strategy meeting!

50
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:08,570
You stay by her with the others.

51
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:10,020
What?!

52
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:12,100
She is being targeted.

53
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:14,550
We need to take precautions.

54
00:04:14,550 --> 00:04:15,670
But…

55
00:04:15,670 --> 00:04:16,980
It’s an important assignment.

56
00:04:17,450 --> 00:04:18,250
I’m counting on you.

57
00:04:20,370 --> 00:04:25,040
Well, if you say so, Sis.

58
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:28,580
Let's go, Ichigo.

59
00:04:28,580 --> 00:04:29,220
Yeah.

60
00:04:31,150 --> 00:04:32,780
Be careful!

61
00:04:44,930 --> 00:04:46,290
Nozomi?

62
00:05:06,330 --> 00:05:09,460
Everyone, thank you for taking time

63
00:05:09,460 --> 00:05:12,070
from your busy schedules to come here.

64
00:05:15,670 --> 00:05:17,060
Never mind the formalities.

65
00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:19,960
What’re we going to do from here on?

66
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:23,100
I’ve already sealed 
off the Precipice World

67
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:25,400
and rendered communications impossible.

68
00:05:25,980 --> 00:05:29,570
We must unite before they can form

69
00:05:29,570 --> 00:05:32,180
a strategy and return here.

70
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:37,050
There are still a few captains who have

71
00:05:37,050 --> 00:05:39,150
not been replaced with a Reigai.

72
00:05:39,390 --> 00:05:41,400
What’ll we do about the Head Captain?

73
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:45,400
I have a plan in mind for him.

74
00:05:45,810 --> 00:05:49,450
Of course, I will need 
everyone’s help.

75
00:05:51,490 --> 00:05:54,120
I don’t care about that.

76
00:05:55,460 --> 00:05:57,730
I’ll listen to anything you say.

77
00:05:58,300 --> 00:05:59,500
So how about it?

78
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:02,460
Hurry up and let me fight him!

79
00:06:02,770 --> 00:06:06,160
Oh, how revolting.

80
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:09,430
Barbarians are so eager to use violence.

81
00:06:09,430 --> 00:06:10,430
What?

82
00:06:10,830 --> 00:06:14,860
Not that I care whom a barbarian 
chooses to fight, of course.

83
00:06:14,860 --> 00:06:17,600
Don’t go carving them up too much.

84
00:06:18,260 --> 00:06:21,810
They’re my important test subjects.

85
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,690
What are your thoughts, Captain Kuchiki?

86
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:30,280
There is only one head 
of the Kuchiki Clan.

87
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,490
There is no need for two.

88
00:06:34,070 --> 00:06:35,300
I see.

89
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:42,610
All your wishes will soon be realized.

90
00:06:43,770 --> 00:06:46,780
Once we have captured that girl.

91
00:06:50,260 --> 00:06:52,300
With these hands,

92
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:55,890
we will transform the world 
into what it should be.

93
00:06:59,790 --> 00:07:02,400
So much trouble for just one girl.

94
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:07,060
Soul Reaper Imposter Crisis Committee Headquarters

95
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:08,680
All right, we will now
Soul Reaper Imposter Crisis Committee Headquarters

96
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:10,930
begin our Soul Reaper 
imposter crisis meeting.
Soul Reaper Imposter Crisis Committee Headquarters

97
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:10,950
begin our Soul Reaper 
imposter crisis meeting.

98
00:07:11,190 --> 00:07:13,500
With your permission, 
I will be your host.

99
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:14,520
Hey!

100
00:07:16,650 --> 00:07:18,660
Huh? What’s the matter, Ichigo?

101
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:21,170
Do you even need to ask?!

102
00:07:21,550 --> 00:07:23,730
Why’re we in my room?!

103
00:07:23,730 --> 00:07:25,060
Now, now…

104
00:07:25,060 --> 00:07:26,730
Too many interruptions!

105
00:07:26,730 --> 00:07:28,450
Get on with it.

106
00:07:32,140 --> 00:07:35,110
The mastermind is Kageroza Inaba,

107
00:07:35,110 --> 00:07:37,460
Seventh Seat in Squad 12

108
00:07:37,460 --> 00:07:38,670
and a section chief in the

109
00:07:38,670 --> 00:07:40,730
Department of Research and Development.

110
00:07:41,020 --> 00:07:44,050
He controlled and studied 
the Precipice World.

111
00:07:44,050 --> 00:07:46,980
In other words, he’s a 
Precipice World specialist.

112
00:07:48,430 --> 00:07:51,120
This Precipice World incident

113
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:53,380
was planned entirely by Kageroza.

114
00:07:54,610 --> 00:07:57,070
He manipulated time 
in the Precipice World

115
00:07:57,070 --> 00:07:59,370
so that we would be met by the Cleaner,

116
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:01,830
he confined us there,

117
00:08:02,250 --> 00:08:04,710
and sent back Reigai versions of

118
00:08:04,710 --> 00:08:07,040
the captains to the Soul Society.

119
00:08:09,980 --> 00:08:11,400
If left unchecked,

120
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:14,040
the entire Thirteen Court Guard Squads

121
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:16,370
will be under his control.

122
00:08:16,370 --> 00:08:18,440
How aggravating!

123
00:08:21,630 --> 00:08:22,730
Kageroza…

124
00:08:23,850 --> 00:08:26,680
He lured me to the Soul Society by

125
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:28,730
manipulating the Thirteen 
Court Guard Squads.

126
00:08:28,730 --> 00:08:31,750
During that time, he 
tried to capture Nozomi.

127
00:08:33,090 --> 00:08:36,740
What is he planning to use Nozomi for?

128
00:08:38,380 --> 00:08:39,700
In all likelihood,

129
00:08:39,990 --> 00:08:44,420
that girl holds some huge secret.

130
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:46,200
For example,

131
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:48,770
he may have hidden something 
inside that girl’s body.

132
00:08:57,770 --> 00:08:58,990
I won’t allow it.

133
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:03,300
I’ll never let something 
like that happen again!

134
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:10,460
URAHARA’S SHOP

135
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:12,440
Mr. Urahara…

136
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:14,290
Thank you very much

137
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:18,540
for providing us this barbeque 
set and the food too.

138
00:09:19,250 --> 00:09:21,540
Not at all. Don’t mention it.

139
00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:23,410
Let’s enjoy it together later.

140
00:09:27,630 --> 00:09:29,520
A barbeque?

141
00:09:30,050 --> 00:09:31,340
Why?

142
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:36,480
It appears you’re even 
dumber than Kurosaki.

143
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:38,430
Watch it!

144
00:09:38,970 --> 00:09:44,670
This is Inoue’s way of 
trying to cheer her up a bit.

145
00:09:45,610 --> 00:09:49,340
That girl’s been though a lot.

146
00:09:53,810 --> 00:09:55,520
I understand Orihime’s intentions,

147
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:57,780
but should we be doing something 
like this during a crisis?

148
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:03,040
Actually, this activity could 
help her open up to us.

149
00:10:04,310 --> 00:10:05,290
Oh, I see.

150
00:10:08,780 --> 00:10:11,250
Come on, everybody! Let’s get started!

151
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:13,820
Ishida, would you mind 
cutting the vegetables?

152
00:10:14,110 --> 00:10:16,040
Sado, you get the fire started, okay?

153
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:16,900
Gotcha!

154
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:30,230
I get it now.

155
00:10:31,210 --> 00:10:32,180
Hey!

156
00:10:32,180 --> 00:10:34,610
What? Goofing off already?

157
00:10:38,420 --> 00:10:42,460
Sorry… This is your welcome party.

158
00:10:43,140 --> 00:10:46,830
Anyway, if no one else, I want 
you to tell me the truth.

159
00:10:46,830 --> 00:10:48,750
I’ll help you any way I can.

160
00:10:52,450 --> 00:10:54,750
Even if it’s something you don’t

161
00:10:54,750 --> 00:10:56,670
want to tell the others,

162
00:10:56,670 --> 00:10:58,350
you can tell me, right?

163
00:10:58,350 --> 00:11:00,790
After all, I did save your life!

164
00:11:08,430 --> 00:11:09,260
Huh?!

165
00:11:09,260 --> 00:11:10,380
What’s that?

166
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:12,150
That thing you’re holding there.

167
00:11:12,670 --> 00:11:15,150
Oh, it’s just chili powder.

168
00:11:15,410 --> 00:11:17,870
Why’re you holding chili powder?

169
00:11:18,610 --> 00:11:20,400
Oh, I see.

170
00:11:20,670 --> 00:11:23,500
You don’t know what 
chili powder is, do you?

171
00:11:23,890 --> 00:11:25,570
I’m right, aren’t I?

172
00:11:25,830 --> 00:11:28,450
Okay! Then I’ll teach you!

173
00:11:28,450 --> 00:11:32,670
Chili powder is awfully 
spicy if you eat it as-is,

174
00:11:32,670 --> 00:11:34,590
and when you put it directly

175
00:11:34,590 --> 00:11:36,500
into the mouth like that, it’s…

176
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:38,510
hot!

177
00:11:39,420 --> 00:11:40,550
My mouth is on fire!

178
00:11:47,670 --> 00:11:49,400
Hot!

179
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:50,640
Hot! Hot! Hot!

180
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:56,320
H-Huh?

181
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:59,360
What’s this all about?

182
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:00,490
Don’t you get it?

183
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:06,450
You’ve defiled the proud Quincy Cross!

184
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:09,410
But that’s a shiitake mushroom.

185
00:12:15,660 --> 00:12:17,580
It’s a specially prepared shiitake.

186
00:12:17,830 --> 00:12:19,790
Eat it with the appreciation 
it deserves!

187
00:12:20,180 --> 00:12:21,920
Yes, sir.

188
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:23,810
Trouble!

189
00:12:24,130 --> 00:12:25,890
Nozomi’s gone!

190
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:27,360
What?!

191
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:34,030
Nozomi!

192
00:12:34,990 --> 00:12:36,520
Nozomi!

193
00:12:38,550 --> 00:12:39,270
Found her?

194
00:12:39,270 --> 00:12:40,270
No.

195
00:12:41,790 --> 00:12:43,650
Hey! Nozomi!

196
00:12:45,430 --> 00:12:48,830
Where the heck could Nozomi have gone?

197
00:12:49,430 --> 00:12:50,320
Huh?

198
00:12:54,490 --> 00:12:55,540
Nozomi!

199
00:12:56,270 --> 00:12:57,250
Found you.

200
00:12:57,530 --> 00:12:58,650
Hey!

201
00:13:00,010 --> 00:13:02,210
We’ve been looking for you, Nozomi!

202
00:13:08,650 --> 00:13:11,180
Wait, Nozomi. Where are you going?

203
00:13:11,490 --> 00:13:13,720
Come back and let’s 
have some barbeque.

204
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:14,480
It’s delicious!

205
00:13:15,970 --> 00:13:16,810
I don’t want any.

206
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:19,830
Don’t be like that. Let’s go back.

207
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:23,300
Everyone’s preparing it just for you.

208
00:13:24,510 --> 00:13:25,820
C’mon, Nozomi.

209
00:13:26,170 --> 00:13:27,780
Let’s go back.

210
00:13:28,420 --> 00:13:30,780
Everyone’s worried.

211
00:13:31,530 --> 00:13:32,750
Not my concern.

212
00:13:38,750 --> 00:13:40,090
What’s with you?!

213
00:13:41,980 --> 00:13:44,130
We’re trying to cheer you up because

214
00:13:44,130 --> 00:13:47,230
we thought you’d be scared 
after being targeted!

215
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:49,970
And you say that’s not your concern?!

216
00:13:50,410 --> 00:13:53,600
Is that how you respond 
to people’s kindness?!

217
00:14:02,770 --> 00:14:03,900
Not my concern.

218
00:14:18,460 --> 00:14:20,360
Hey, what are you doing?

219
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:21,130
What do you want?!

220
00:14:21,550 --> 00:14:23,500
Oh! Rangiku!

221
00:14:24,010 --> 00:14:25,960
W-What’s the matter?

222
00:14:26,310 --> 00:14:28,930
Hear me out, Rangiku!

223
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:32,420
That chick is cocky, violent, goes off

224
00:14:32,420 --> 00:14:35,190
on her own and doesn’t 
listen to people.

225
00:14:35,190 --> 00:14:37,890
We’re trying to look after her,

226
00:14:37,890 --> 00:14:39,480
but she doesn’t appreciate it one bit!

227
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:41,110
Even I’ve had it with her!

228
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:43,380
Oh?

229
00:14:46,170 --> 00:14:47,990
I don’t know what’s going on,

230
00:14:47,990 --> 00:14:49,500
but you seem to be having a hard time.

231
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:59,340
All right. Let me handle this.

232
00:14:59,340 --> 00:14:59,830
Huh?

233
00:15:00,190 --> 00:15:03,020
Girls her age are difficult, you know.

234
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:05,380
Let me handle this woman-to-woman, okay?

235
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:06,920
Really?!

236
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:08,530
That’d be a great help!

237
00:15:08,530 --> 00:15:13,040
Oh, but everyone is looking for Nozomi.

238
00:15:14,290 --> 00:15:15,960
Which means if I go back without her,

239
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:18,100
they’ll get on my case again.

240
00:15:18,290 --> 00:15:19,800
It’ll be fine.

241
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:23,610
I’ll convince her to go back.

242
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:27,570
But, I’m a man.

243
00:15:28,180 --> 00:15:30,700
A man must keep his promise.

244
00:15:31,170 --> 00:15:32,440
Come on.

245
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:32,950
Huh?

246
00:15:33,660 --> 00:15:35,990
Let me handle this. Please?

247
00:15:35,990 --> 00:15:38,660
She’s all yours!

248
00:15:40,510 --> 00:15:41,800
Come on, Nozomi.

249
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:43,850
Let’s talk over there.

250
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:45,380
Come with me.

251
00:15:55,190 --> 00:15:57,830
That’s such a relief.

252
00:15:58,270 --> 00:16:00,790
If that chick were a little more open,

253
00:16:00,790 --> 00:16:02,800
she might even be cute.

254
00:16:03,110 --> 00:16:04,730
But Rangiku, now she’s…

255
00:16:06,710 --> 00:16:08,260
<i>Let me handle this. </i>

256
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:11,240
<i>Please? </i>

257
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:15,240
Rangiku…

258
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:16,910
What about me?

259
00:16:17,250 --> 00:16:18,080
What?!

260
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:20,740
R-Rangiku… Why’re you—?

261
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:22,540
Where’s Nozomi?

262
00:16:23,290 --> 00:16:24,130
Huh?

263
00:16:24,770 --> 00:16:26,150
What are you talking about?

264
00:16:26,150 --> 00:16:27,420
I haven’t seen her.

265
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:28,500
What?

266
00:16:30,140 --> 00:16:32,940
Kon, what’re you doing here?

267
00:16:36,090 --> 00:16:37,220
What’s with him?

268
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:38,370
<i>Damn it! </i>

269
00:16:38,370 --> 00:16:39,900
<i>It’s my fault. </i>

270
00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:41,850
<i>I let her out of my sight. </i>

271
00:16:43,170 --> 00:16:44,520
<i>It’s an important assignment. </i>

272
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:46,280
<i>I’m counting on you. </i>

273
00:16:57,250 --> 00:16:58,410
L-Let me go.

274
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:00,370
Let me go! Let me go!

275
00:17:10,210 --> 00:17:11,260
Now then…

276
00:17:11,260 --> 00:17:13,800
Let’s talk on the other side.

277
00:17:22,220 --> 00:17:23,810
Now you’ve done it!

278
00:17:28,570 --> 00:17:29,750
You…

279
00:17:30,540 --> 00:17:32,300
Sorry it took so long, Nozomi!

280
00:17:32,550 --> 00:17:36,380
I saw through your guise 
from the very start!

281
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:41,950
Don’t interfere!

282
00:17:42,250 --> 00:17:44,270
Stop, you imposter!

283
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:45,760
Damn you!

284
00:17:49,420 --> 00:17:50,880
Nozomi, run!

285
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:55,170
Imposter?

286
00:18:01,110 --> 00:18:02,950
Who’re you calling an imposter?!

287
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:05,680
From here on,

288
00:18:05,930 --> 00:18:07,190
we’re the real ones!

289
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:14,380
H-Hey!

290
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:18,430
Nozomi… Hurry and get away.

291
00:18:18,780 --> 00:18:23,370
Don’t worry, I’ll 
defeat that imposter.

292
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:26,020
You fool! You can’t…

293
00:18:26,020 --> 00:18:27,210
Nozomi…

294
00:18:28,610 --> 00:18:30,270
I’m sorry…

295
00:18:30,790 --> 00:18:32,980
I left you alone like that.

296
00:18:33,970 --> 00:18:35,030
You…

297
00:19:04,150 --> 00:19:05,290
Too bad.

298
00:19:06,850 --> 00:19:10,050
Did you really think you 
could stop me with this?

299
00:19:10,420 --> 00:19:12,040
You sure underestimated me.

300
00:19:16,660 --> 00:19:18,970
Now then… Shall we go, Nozomi?

301
00:19:20,770 --> 00:19:21,810
Stop!

302
00:19:24,450 --> 00:19:25,760
But before that…

303
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:28,770
You need to be punished 
for being a bad girl!

304
00:19:36,220 --> 00:19:37,320
Ichigo!

305
00:19:44,510 --> 00:19:46,040
It ends here.

306
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:48,950
Give it up, you imposter!

307
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:53,880
So this is my imposter, huh?

308
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:56,090
She’s quite a fine woman.

309
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:59,550
But no match for the original, though.

310
00:20:02,050 --> 00:20:03,790
Growl, Haineko!

311
00:20:11,180 --> 00:20:12,850
She got away.

312
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:27,490
Hey!

313
00:20:27,860 --> 00:20:29,450
I’m glad you’re okay.

314
00:20:29,930 --> 00:20:33,330
Of course, it’s all thanks 
to my awesome feats.

315
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:40,220
Show some appreciation!

316
00:20:42,630 --> 00:20:43,630
What?

317
00:20:43,630 --> 00:20:45,490
What are you talking about?

318
00:20:45,490 --> 00:20:48,470
This all started because you 
took your eyes off of her.

319
00:20:49,150 --> 00:20:51,750
Why did you leave her by 
herself in the first place?!

320
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:53,500
Didn’t Rukia make 
it very clear to you?!

321
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:55,900
Umm…I…umm…

322
00:20:55,900 --> 00:20:56,570
Perverted freak.

323
00:20:56,570 --> 00:20:57,690
No, I…

324
00:20:58,160 --> 00:21:02,480
Kurosaki, Nozomi… The meat is ready!

325
00:21:02,930 --> 00:21:05,160
Okay! I’ll bring it for you!

326
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:06,610
Jeez…

327
00:21:06,990 --> 00:21:08,720
Don’t worry, Nozomi.

328
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,040
From here on, we’ll protect you.

329
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:17,960
Are you people stupid?

330
00:21:18,570 --> 00:21:19,700
Who knows?

331
00:21:21,050 --> 00:21:21,760
Nozomi.

332
00:21:22,460 --> 00:21:24,970
Have some barbeque! It’s delicious!

333
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:29,080
Try it!

334
00:23:20,420 --> 00:23:21,970
This sure turned out to be quite a mess.

335
00:23:21,970 --> 00:23:23,100
Not entirely.

336
00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:24,900
Having two Marechiyo Omaedas would

337
00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:26,980
equate to twice the consumption 
of fried rice crackers.

338
00:23:26,980 --> 00:23:28,390
Having two Rangiku Matsumoto would

339
00:23:28,390 --> 00:23:30,240
equate to having two Soul 
Reapers who won’t do work,

340
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:31,550
while having two Kenpachi 
Zaraki would equate

341
00:23:31,550 --> 00:23:33,550
to double the destruction 
being done. That’s all.

342
00:23:33,550 --> 00:23:34,890
I’ve heard enough.

Illustrated Guide to Soul Reapers.

344
00:23:37,310 --> 00:23:40,300
Hear me out, Captain!

345
00:23:40,300 --> 00:23:44,110
My Reigai had a wrinkle right here!

346
00:23:44,110 --> 00:23:46,440
Can you believe they would 
go through the trouble

347
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:48,030
just to add something like 
that for a sick joke?!

348
00:23:48,030 --> 00:23:49,700
That’s not true!

349
00:23:50,100 --> 00:23:52,410
I hate to admit it, but 
the Reigai he developed

350
00:23:53,130 --> 00:23:55,910
are perfect copies of ourselves!

351
00:23:57,530 --> 00:24:00,060
M-M-Must replenish my 
collagen supply with…

352
00:24:00,060 --> 00:24:00,830
meat!

353
00:24:00,830 --> 00:24:02,830
Meat, meat, meat, meat,

354
00:24:02,830 --> 00:24:04,550
My meat!
