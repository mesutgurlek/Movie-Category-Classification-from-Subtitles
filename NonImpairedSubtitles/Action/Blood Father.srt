1
00:01:23,483 --> 00:01:25,617
And a pack of camel lights.

2
00:01:25,619 --> 00:01:27,419
ID?

3
00:01:27,421 --> 00:01:29,121
I can't sell 'em to you
without an ID, honey.

4
00:01:30,423 --> 00:01:31,390
Then just the bullets.

5
00:01:35,295 --> 00:01:36,328
Please?

6
00:01:55,215 --> 00:01:58,417
I said 45s.
Mine don't even take
these cheap-ass nines.

7
00:01:58,419 --> 00:01:59,785
I thought you had 9mm.

8
00:01:59,787 --> 00:02:01,353
I'm fucking useless now, man.

9
00:02:02,255 --> 00:02:03,755
I can't even smoke nobody!

10
00:02:03,757 --> 00:02:05,157
Your bitch fucked me, Jonah!

11
00:02:32,218 --> 00:02:33,585
See you there.

12
00:02:39,492 --> 00:02:41,226
Why did he have to
talk to me like that?

13
00:02:41,228 --> 00:02:42,661
Let him get his own bullets.

14
00:02:42,663 --> 00:02:45,430
Are we really
doing this right now?

15
00:02:45,432 --> 00:02:48,834
What did I tell you about
the people in the house?

16
00:02:48,836 --> 00:02:50,769
We pay them to live here.

17
00:02:50,771 --> 00:02:53,438
To be normal fucking people,
like I did with you.

18
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:54,806
What's in the house?

19
00:02:54,808 --> 00:02:56,308
I don't know.

20
00:02:58,511 --> 00:02:59,845
Good girl.

21
00:02:59,847 --> 00:03:01,413
Good.

22
00:03:01,415 --> 00:03:03,916
And you didn't know
what was in your house, right?

23
00:03:05,318 --> 00:03:06,718
The problem is,

24
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:08,554
not many
people believe you.

25
00:03:08,556 --> 00:03:10,956
I swear to god,
i never saw anything.

26
00:03:10,958 --> 00:03:12,291
I never took anything.

27
00:03:12,792 --> 00:03:14,526
I believe you.

28
00:03:17,664 --> 00:03:19,898
But you want
my trust, no?

29
00:03:20,967 --> 00:03:24,203
Then prove it
like I did.

30
00:03:28,474 --> 00:03:31,210
Okay.

31
00:03:31,212 --> 00:03:34,780
Look, grab that gun
and go cover that
fucking back door, okay?

32
00:04:04,477 --> 00:04:05,344
Come on.

33
00:04:14,554 --> 00:04:15,721
Okay?

34
00:04:18,791 --> 00:04:20,392
Okay, don't blink.

35
00:04:34,374 --> 00:04:36,441
Shut up!
That's right,
butterfinger.

36
00:04:36,443 --> 00:04:38,010
Come on! You...

37
00:04:38,012 --> 00:04:39,478
You let him intercept it?

38
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:41,013
Yes!

39
00:04:41,015 --> 00:04:41,947
Man,
you're really...

40
00:04:43,583 --> 00:04:45,317
Whoa! A gun.

41
00:04:45,319 --> 00:04:46,285
Uh...

42
00:04:46,287 --> 00:04:47,919
Don't do that!

43
00:04:47,921 --> 00:04:50,022
Oh, shoot Teddy, please.
That'd be awesome!

44
00:05:08,509 --> 00:05:10,742
It's not here.
Where the fuck is it?

45
00:05:15,883 --> 00:05:17,749
Kids, run! Fast!

46
00:05:17,751 --> 00:05:19,551
Shut up!

47
00:05:19,553 --> 00:05:21,320
Fucking daycare
center out there.

48
00:05:21,322 --> 00:05:22,087
Where the
fuck's our money?

49
00:05:22,089 --> 00:05:23,422
She's a fucking liar!

50
00:05:23,424 --> 00:05:24,756
No! I do not...

51
00:05:25,858 --> 00:05:27,392
See?

52
00:05:27,394 --> 00:05:29,094
Fucking lie to me!

53
00:05:29,096 --> 00:05:33,365
This is what she
gets for stealing.

54
00:05:34,067 --> 00:05:35,801
Was it worth it?

55
00:05:35,803 --> 00:05:38,103
She cares more about
money than she did
about her husband.

56
00:05:41,541 --> 00:05:44,009
Jonah. Jonah,
please don't hurt her.

57
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:52,684
And
i can't find shit!

58
00:05:52,686 --> 00:05:55,354
Show me I'm not
wrong about you.

59
00:05:55,356 --> 00:05:58,824
Relax, breathe.
Breathe. There you go.

60
00:06:02,995 --> 00:06:04,596
This is how you prove it!

61
00:06:08,668 --> 00:06:10,402
You're alive because of me!

62
00:06:12,505 --> 00:06:13,672
No one believes you.

63
00:06:13,674 --> 00:06:16,742
You're already
a murderer, baby.

64
00:06:16,744 --> 00:06:19,010
Every bullet here
will be traced
back to that store.

65
00:06:24,884 --> 00:06:26,051
Okay.

66
00:06:27,453 --> 00:06:28,620
Pull the trigger.

67
00:06:30,757 --> 00:06:31,723
Do it.

68
00:06:32,558 --> 00:06:33,725
Shoot.

69
00:06:41,935 --> 00:06:42,801
Now!

70
00:06:48,474 --> 00:06:49,841
Jonah?

71
00:06:49,843 --> 00:06:51,042
Let's go, let's go.

72
00:07:03,824 --> 00:07:04,923
Happy birthday.

73
00:07:04,925 --> 00:07:06,558
Happy birthday, man.

74
00:07:09,529 --> 00:07:09,528
Thanks, thanks.

75
00:07:09,530 --> 00:07:12,864
For those who don't know me,
my name's John link.

76
00:07:12,866 --> 00:07:13,965
Hi, John!

77
00:07:13,967 --> 00:07:16,668
And I'm a real success story.

78
00:07:16,670 --> 00:07:20,138
Been sober two years,
one inside the joint,
one out here.

79
00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:23,141
Before that, I was
never clean for very long.

80
00:07:23,143 --> 00:07:25,744
Except maybe in the womb,
but knowing mom,

81
00:07:25,746 --> 00:07:28,113
I was probably
pickled there, too.

82
00:07:28,115 --> 00:07:29,915
I did a lot of damage.

83
00:07:29,917 --> 00:07:31,883
Lost a lot of
people along the way.

84
00:07:31,885 --> 00:07:34,586
Some of 'em stay lost.

85
00:07:34,588 --> 00:07:36,588
It's not like they
come back and give
you an "atta boy"

86
00:07:36,590 --> 00:07:39,191
for quitting,
you know?

87
00:07:39,193 --> 00:07:42,761
I got a kid I can't find,
except on a milk carton.

88
00:07:42,763 --> 00:07:45,464
Ex that won't talk to me.

89
00:07:45,466 --> 00:07:47,833
Every skill I ever had,
every friend
i ever knew,

90
00:07:47,835 --> 00:07:50,836
is now a parole violation.

91
00:07:50,838 --> 00:07:52,671
But you can't be
a prick all your life

92
00:07:52,673 --> 00:07:55,907
and then just say,
"nevermind," you know?

93
00:07:55,909 --> 00:07:58,577
I can't fix
everything I broke.

94
00:07:58,579 --> 00:08:02,981
All I can do is not drink.
So, I won't do that today.

95
00:08:02,983 --> 00:08:05,884
It's like when I was in
the joint all that time.

96
00:08:05,886 --> 00:08:08,487
Just count off every
fucking day until I die.

97
00:08:11,157 --> 00:08:13,592
Well, happy birthday,
you grumpy old bastard.

98
00:08:13,594 --> 00:08:15,527
Am I allowed to be
in a bad mood, Kirby?
Of course.

99
00:08:15,529 --> 00:08:18,063
I just think we should
go get some coffee,
so you can calm down a bit.

100
00:08:18,065 --> 00:08:19,698
Nah, I got some work.

101
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:21,766
Got some people coming over
with some bullshit ideas.

102
00:08:21,768 --> 00:08:23,201
Well, they picked
the right guy for that.

103
00:08:23,203 --> 00:08:25,670
Seems everybody's
full of shit today,
but you.

104
00:08:25,672 --> 00:08:27,772
Well, maybe
i just hate birthdays,
all right?

105
00:08:27,774 --> 00:08:29,741
Makes you think there's
some kind of reward
for all this shit.

106
00:08:29,743 --> 00:08:31,710
No, there's no reward,

107
00:08:31,712 --> 00:08:33,945
there's just a reminder
from why you're quitting
to people you're hurt.

108
00:08:33,947 --> 00:08:36,248
Maybe some
people need hurtin'.
With a chain.

109
00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:38,950
Look at the person
that really did this. You.

110
00:08:38,952 --> 00:08:41,586
And if you
learn some Patience,
there is a reward.

111
00:08:41,588 --> 00:08:44,055
It's believing
in something
bigger than yourself.

112
00:08:44,057 --> 00:08:45,957
Kirby, how fucking
patient do I have to be?

113
00:08:45,959 --> 00:08:49,060
I'm here, right?
I'm looking at this
fucking mess every day.

114
00:08:49,062 --> 00:08:51,129
There's some people
left me out there to rot.

115
00:08:51,131 --> 00:08:52,631
Sometimes, I just
wanna find them

116
00:08:52,633 --> 00:08:53,932
and go say "hello"
with a blowtorch.

117
00:08:53,934 --> 00:08:54,966
Oh, it's a blowtorch now.

118
00:08:54,968 --> 00:08:56,601
Yeah, they deserve it.

119
00:08:56,603 --> 00:08:58,770
All right,
that's true, John,

120
00:08:58,772 --> 00:08:59,938
and it might be fitting.

121
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:01,740
But it wouldn't be proper.

122
00:09:01,742 --> 00:09:03,842
You know the difference
between fitting and proper?

123
00:09:03,844 --> 00:09:06,177
Well, I'm not
a trailer park poet
like you, Kirby.

124
00:09:06,179 --> 00:09:07,245
You're gonna
have to tell me.

125
00:09:07,247 --> 00:09:09,681
Well, it goes like this.

126
00:09:09,683 --> 00:09:12,284
I could shove
my thumb up
your ass right now

127
00:09:12,286 --> 00:09:13,652
and it
would probably fit.

128
00:09:13,654 --> 00:09:14,319
Mmm-hmm.

129
00:09:15,688 --> 00:09:16,922
But it wouldn't be proper.

130
00:09:21,093 --> 00:09:23,194
That's sweet talk
to an ex-con like me.

131
00:09:23,196 --> 00:09:25,030
That coffee still on?

132
00:09:25,032 --> 00:09:26,164
Go fuck yourself.

133
00:09:26,166 --> 00:09:27,899
Okay, you, too.

134
00:09:31,672 --> 00:09:35,340
You know, we've been
divorced three years?

135
00:09:35,342 --> 00:09:38,276
I come home from work
with that man sitting
at my kitchen table.

136
00:09:46,052 --> 00:09:49,888
But I'm a single woman
now and I got no
intention of going back.

137
00:09:49,890 --> 00:09:51,656
I've done my time.

138
00:09:51,658 --> 00:09:54,092
You done
a little time, too? Huh?

139
00:09:55,695 --> 00:09:56,962
Yup, just a little.

140
00:10:04,070 --> 00:10:05,737
Um...

141
00:10:05,739 --> 00:10:07,072
That's your little girl?

142
00:10:07,707 --> 00:10:08,373
Mmm-hmm.

143
00:10:10,276 --> 00:10:12,143
Why? You seen her?

144
00:10:13,846 --> 00:10:14,746
No.

145
00:10:39,338 --> 00:10:41,906
Missing link tattoo.

146
00:10:41,908 --> 00:10:43,942
<i> This is a collect call from...</i>

147
00:10:43,944 --> 00:10:46,745
<i> Your fucked-up daughter.</i>

148
00:10:46,747 --> 00:10:49,814
<i> To accept the charges, say,</i>
<i> "yes," or press one now.</i>

149
00:10:49,816 --> 00:10:51,149
Yes.

150
00:10:51,151 --> 00:10:52,350
<i> Sorry, I did</i>
<i> not understand.</i>
Yes.

151
00:10:52,352 --> 00:10:53,752
<i> Do you accept this call?</i>
Ye...

152
00:10:53,754 --> 00:10:55,687
Yes, you fucking robot!
Yes, yes!

153
00:10:58,224 --> 00:10:59,224
<i> Oh, fuck.</i>

154
00:11:01,327 --> 00:11:02,661
<i> Dad?</i>

155
00:11:02,663 --> 00:11:04,429
I'm here.
Where the hell are you?

156
00:11:05,831 --> 00:11:07,165
I just...

157
00:11:08,934 --> 00:11:11,670
I know that it's
been a really long time,
i just...

158
00:11:12,805 --> 00:11:13,905
<i> Fuck.</i>

159
00:11:13,907 --> 00:11:16,741
Well, just stay
on the line.

160
00:11:16,743 --> 00:11:18,843
Where you been, kid?

161
00:11:18,845 --> 00:11:22,414
I left home,
a while ago.

162
00:11:22,416 --> 00:11:24,416
Yeah, I know.
You scared a lot of people.

163
00:11:24,418 --> 00:11:26,351
I need cash fast. Fuck.

164
00:11:26,353 --> 00:11:29,320
Just enough so I can get lost,
because I am fucking dead.

165
00:11:29,322 --> 00:11:32,390
I'm like this fly
that's about to get
splattered on a windshield.

166
00:11:32,392 --> 00:11:33,892
<i> Does that make any sense?</i>

167
00:11:33,894 --> 00:11:35,326
No.

168
00:11:35,328 --> 00:11:37,762
Oh, fuck. I know this is
so unbelievably rude.

169
00:11:37,764 --> 00:11:40,031
<i> Normally, I would be all,</i>
<i> "oh, let's catch up."</i>

170
00:11:40,033 --> 00:11:43,935
My point is,
i took the bus as far
as I can get tonight.

171
00:11:43,937 --> 00:11:46,304
I figure I can get
to Oregon by Monday.

172
00:11:46,306 --> 00:11:48,473
Okay, yeah.
How much do you need?

173
00:11:48,475 --> 00:11:53,411
Two g's tops,
if I can, you know,
get settled and start working.

174
00:11:53,413 --> 00:11:55,146
What kind of work
were you looking for?

175
00:11:55,148 --> 00:11:58,750
Fuck. Fuck.
I am so sorry about this.

176
00:11:58,752 --> 00:12:01,920
<i> I don't know, a nanny?</i>

177
00:12:01,922 --> 00:12:03,888
Well, I got the money
right here in my hand.

178
00:12:05,825 --> 00:12:06,825
Just stay put
till I get there.

179
00:12:09,428 --> 00:12:12,197
That is so first class.

180
00:12:12,199 --> 00:12:15,867
<i> I can meet you</i>
<i> in Santa Monica,</i>
<i> on third and Broadway.</i>

181
00:12:15,869 --> 00:12:17,335
Okay. Stay put.

182
00:12:30,049 --> 00:12:31,182
My...

183
00:12:43,830 --> 00:12:45,430
They can take us now!

184
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,801
I wanted to buy an eighth.

185
00:12:52,839 --> 00:12:54,773
I hadn't seen him
in so many years.

186
00:13:25,471 --> 00:13:26,538
Lydia.

187
00:13:28,073 --> 00:13:29,941
Hey, kid.

188
00:13:29,943 --> 00:13:31,810
Come here.
Come on, sit down.

189
00:13:36,148 --> 00:13:38,349
You're okay.
I got you now.

190
00:13:51,463 --> 00:13:53,464
Thank you for
coming so far.

191
00:13:54,466 --> 00:13:56,201
Sure.

192
00:13:56,203 --> 00:13:58,970
I'm gonna pay you
back every dollar.

193
00:13:59,939 --> 00:14:00,839
Okay.

194
00:14:03,409 --> 00:14:07,946
I almost didn't
recognize you in this car,
i was... you know...

195
00:14:07,948 --> 00:14:11,149
I was expecting you
to be holding on
to the old hog.

196
00:14:11,151 --> 00:14:13,184
Well, that's
a parole violation now.

197
00:14:13,186 --> 00:14:14,052
Oh.

198
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:15,920
Assholes.

199
00:14:17,890 --> 00:14:20,892
Listen, kid. Why don't
you take a little nap?

200
00:15:38,103 --> 00:15:39,070
Fuck.

201
00:15:43,442 --> 00:15:44,642
What the fuck.

202
00:16:09,635 --> 00:16:11,436
I don't even
know where I am

203
00:16:11,438 --> 00:16:14,205
and there are only
five channels on your TV.

204
00:16:14,207 --> 00:16:15,373
Yeah.

205
00:16:18,178 --> 00:16:22,046
You swivel these ears here,
and maybe get channel eleven.

206
00:16:22,048 --> 00:16:24,082
Oh. So,
i went back in time.

207
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:37,362
If I turn myself in,
do I get this reward?

208
00:16:37,364 --> 00:16:38,429
Nope.

209
00:16:38,431 --> 00:16:39,731
What a rip.

210
00:16:39,733 --> 00:16:40,999
Hey, hold still.

211
00:16:41,001 --> 00:16:42,000
Sorry.

212
00:16:46,638 --> 00:16:48,139
Some of my
best work there.

213
00:16:48,141 --> 00:16:49,440
Ah.

214
00:16:49,442 --> 00:16:50,708
don quixote.
Mmm.

215
00:16:52,111 --> 00:16:53,177
Picasso.

216
00:16:53,179 --> 00:16:55,580
Kid's got education.
Yeah.

217
00:16:55,582 --> 00:16:57,048
Wanted to put
it in a magazine,

218
00:16:57,050 --> 00:16:58,716
but we couldn't
find this motherfucker.

219
00:16:58,718 --> 00:17:01,052
I ain't no male model.
No shit.

220
00:17:01,054 --> 00:17:04,122
Yeah, but, dude,
i think Sancho panza
might have melanoma.

221
00:17:05,224 --> 00:17:06,190
What?

222
00:17:09,194 --> 00:17:11,562
Why don't you go
outside and play?

223
00:17:16,802 --> 00:17:18,803
You really should have
that looked at, Dennis.

224
00:17:41,693 --> 00:17:43,361
I can't stay much longer.

225
00:17:45,264 --> 00:17:46,364
Uh-huh. Oregon.

226
00:17:46,366 --> 00:17:47,665
No, I don't have
to go to Oregon,

227
00:17:47,667 --> 00:17:49,067
I just have to go somewhere.

228
00:17:50,069 --> 00:17:50,735
You pregnant?

229
00:17:53,338 --> 00:17:54,405
No.

230
00:17:54,407 --> 00:17:56,074
That's so medieval.

231
00:17:57,376 --> 00:18:00,111
But I don't wanna
say too much

232
00:18:00,113 --> 00:18:03,081
'cause it'd put you
in a bad position.

233
00:18:03,083 --> 00:18:05,383
You see,
my boyfriend thought
we could get married

234
00:18:05,385 --> 00:18:07,718
so that I wouldn't have to
testify against him in court.

235
00:18:08,687 --> 00:18:10,388
Pretty romantic.

236
00:18:10,390 --> 00:18:13,091
No, no,
he was so in love with me,
i swear to god.

237
00:18:13,093 --> 00:18:14,559
I don't even think
there was a word

238
00:18:14,561 --> 00:18:16,260
for what was
wrong with him.

239
00:18:16,262 --> 00:18:17,795
And he's worried
you'll say that in court?

240
00:18:19,465 --> 00:18:20,598
No.

241
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:22,233
Uh...

242
00:18:22,235 --> 00:18:24,402
It's terrible,
he's gone.

243
00:18:24,404 --> 00:18:27,171
He's, uh, dead.
Your boyfriend?

244
00:18:27,173 --> 00:18:28,639
He got shot.
Too bad.

245
00:18:28,641 --> 00:18:30,541
In the neck. Yeah.

246
00:18:30,543 --> 00:18:31,676
Rough break.

247
00:18:31,678 --> 00:18:33,277
I just feel numb.
You know?

248
00:18:33,279 --> 00:18:35,413
I don't even
think it's hit me yet

249
00:18:35,415 --> 00:18:36,581
that all of this
is happening.

250
00:18:36,583 --> 00:18:38,149
Me neither.

251
00:18:38,151 --> 00:18:39,851
Like, maybe
I'm traumatized.
Could be.

252
00:18:39,853 --> 00:18:41,686
That's why i
have to keep moving.

253
00:18:41,688 --> 00:18:43,688
He was really
well connected,

254
00:18:43,690 --> 00:18:47,758
so there are a lot
of people looking for
my white ass right now.

255
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:49,494
Kid, can I say something?

256
00:18:49,496 --> 00:18:52,396
I know what it's like
to come down this hard.

257
00:18:52,398 --> 00:18:54,799
For 30 years,
i was drinking and
drugging and fighting

258
00:18:54,801 --> 00:18:56,834
like everybody
had it in for me.

259
00:18:56,836 --> 00:19:00,505
Your higher power
can't do shit
for me here, dad.

260
00:19:00,507 --> 00:19:02,807
When I called you,
you said that
you had money.

261
00:19:02,809 --> 00:19:04,809
Now, I'm not criticizing.

262
00:19:04,811 --> 00:19:06,677
I'm just saying,

263
00:19:06,679 --> 00:19:09,413
it kind of looks
like you miss
the comforts of jail.

264
00:19:11,251 --> 00:19:12,683
I can get you money,
if that's what you want, kid.

265
00:19:12,685 --> 00:19:14,919
But let me make a deal.

266
00:19:16,622 --> 00:19:18,389
Give me a week.

267
00:19:18,391 --> 00:19:20,158
One week,
you stay clean.

268
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:21,259
You got people
looking for you,

269
00:19:21,261 --> 00:19:22,326
who's gonna
find you out here?

270
00:19:22,328 --> 00:19:22,326
Nobody knows who I am.

271
00:19:22,328 --> 00:19:25,163
The cops probably
keep track of you.

272
00:19:25,165 --> 00:19:26,797
It means I piss in
a cup once a month.

273
00:19:26,799 --> 00:19:29,734
My parole officer
has a caseload
like, you know?

274
00:19:29,736 --> 00:19:31,302
Give me a week.

275
00:19:31,304 --> 00:19:32,770
If you're on your
feet by Saturday,

276
00:19:32,772 --> 00:19:34,472
I'll give you everything
i got in this world.

277
00:19:34,474 --> 00:19:35,940
But you gotta
stop with the drama.

278
00:19:38,211 --> 00:19:41,279
<i>- Hello?</i>
- It's me.

279
00:19:41,281 --> 00:19:44,215
<i> God, what now?</i>
<i> I am done, John.</i>

280
00:19:44,217 --> 00:19:45,783
<i> 30 grand is</i>
<i> enough for a reward.</i>

281
00:19:45,785 --> 00:19:47,785
<i> I can't do this</i>

282
00:19:47,787 --> 00:19:49,754
<i> every time you have</i>
<i> some stupid new</i>
<i> plan about Lydia.</i>

283
00:19:49,756 --> 00:19:51,889
<i> - I have a life.</i>
<i>- I have people over.</i>

284
00:20:31,330 --> 00:20:32,630
You okay in there, kid?

285
00:20:32,632 --> 00:20:33,965
Yeah, I'm awesome, thanks.

286
00:20:33,967 --> 00:20:33,965
Don't take your
purse in there.

287
00:20:33,967 --> 00:20:37,635
Can I please just have
one second to myself?

288
00:20:37,637 --> 00:20:39,904
Well, you can live
in there if you like,
just leave the purse outside.

289
00:20:43,408 --> 00:20:44,976
Fuck.

290
00:20:56,355 --> 00:20:57,555
I don't know what it is.

291
00:20:57,557 --> 00:20:59,523
Come on, come on!
You know this. Listen.

292
00:21:05,397 --> 00:21:06,664
You stumped me.

293
00:21:06,666 --> 00:21:08,666
Dude!
You must be tone-deaf!

294
00:21:11,870 --> 00:21:13,638
I don't know it.

295
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:14,739
Argh!

296
00:21:14,741 --> 00:21:16,474
Fuck.

297
00:21:16,476 --> 00:21:19,377
Where you hiding the shit?
Tell me right fucking now!

298
00:21:19,379 --> 00:21:21,779
This is not cute.
I worked too hard.
This place is clean.

299
00:21:21,781 --> 00:21:23,981
I'm not going down
for a game of
fucking hide-and-seek!

300
00:21:26,685 --> 00:21:27,952
God damn it!

301
00:21:30,422 --> 00:21:31,622
You still got
all your teeth.

302
00:21:31,624 --> 00:21:32,757
How long you
been doin' this?

303
00:21:33,959 --> 00:21:35,726
A month?

304
00:21:35,728 --> 00:21:38,062
You telling me the truth?
Yes, that's the truth.

305
00:21:44,036 --> 00:21:45,436
And it's Hank Williams.

306
00:21:45,438 --> 00:21:46,704
That's what I was
playing for you.

307
00:21:46,706 --> 00:21:48,439
What the fuck?

308
00:21:48,441 --> 00:21:51,609
Hank Williams.
That's what I was
playing for you before.

309
00:21:51,611 --> 00:21:54,312
Mom said that you
always loved him.

310
00:21:57,716 --> 00:21:59,917
Yeah, well,
i guess I just don't
recognize him anymore.

311
00:22:06,992 --> 00:22:09,427
Kirby.

312
00:22:09,429 --> 00:22:10,928
I don't know
what I stepped in,
man, but she's here.

313
00:22:10,930 --> 00:22:12,363
My little girl.

314
00:22:12,365 --> 00:22:13,831
<i> You found her.</i>

315
00:22:13,833 --> 00:22:16,634
No, she found me.
But she's out of
her fucking mind.

316
00:22:16,636 --> 00:22:20,938
Well, I remember when
i tried to reconnect with
my sister and my ex-wife.

317
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:22,440
They were not
ready to forgive me.

318
00:22:22,442 --> 00:22:24,442
It was destructive.

319
00:22:24,444 --> 00:22:26,477
It was the wrong time
to try to make amends.

320
00:22:26,479 --> 00:22:28,479
Make amends?
Kirby, I'm trying
to keep the kid away

321
00:22:28,481 --> 00:22:28,479
from the fuckin'
floor stripper.

322
00:22:28,481 --> 00:22:32,450
<i> She's comin' down</i>
<i> hard off somethin'.</i>
<i> Oh.</i>

323
00:22:32,452 --> 00:22:33,918
Well, then she
needs help, John.

324
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:36,554
Get her into detox.
Take her to the hospital.

325
00:22:36,556 --> 00:22:39,357
Man, I don't know.
She's goin' on
about some kind of shit,

326
00:22:39,359 --> 00:22:40,958
some sort of
trouble she's in.

327
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:42,493
I don't know what's bullshit
and what's not anymore,

328
00:22:42,495 --> 00:22:42,493
but I'd just
as soon find out

329
00:22:42,495 --> 00:22:45,930
before I start filling out
intake forms, you know?

330
00:22:45,932 --> 00:22:47,832
No, no, no, you're
still thinkin' like a con.

331
00:22:47,834 --> 00:22:49,367
Take her to the hospital.

332
00:22:49,369 --> 00:22:50,901
<i> Oh,</i>
<i> come on, Kirby.</i>

333
00:22:50,903 --> 00:22:53,037
I just met the girl for
the first time in years,

334
00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:53,037
I just don't feel
like handing her over
to a bunch of strangers.

335
00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:57,041
You're the stranger.
You didn't meet her,
and she didn't meet you.

336
00:22:57,043 --> 00:22:59,443
Right now,
she's nothin' but
a chemistry experiment.

337
00:22:59,445 --> 00:23:01,145
<i> You need help</i>
<i> with this, John.</i>

338
00:23:07,619 --> 00:23:09,019
Well, then, why ask?

339
00:23:14,826 --> 00:23:16,594
<i> Cutting up the veggies here.</i>

340
00:23:16,596 --> 00:23:16,594
<i> We wanna try and</i>
<i> keep the vegetables</i>

341
00:23:16,596 --> 00:23:19,563
<i> all the same</i>
<i> size so they can...</i>

342
00:23:24,136 --> 00:23:24,135
<i> ...and make</i>
<i> a fresh herb mixture</i>

343
00:23:24,137 --> 00:23:29,140
<i> with parsley, thyme,</i>
<i> fennel flakes and garlic.</i>

344
00:23:57,702 --> 00:23:58,869
Can I help
you gentlemen?

345
00:23:58,871 --> 00:24:01,505
Yeah. We want tattoos.

346
00:24:01,507 --> 00:24:03,040
I'm not open.

347
00:24:03,042 --> 00:24:05,476
It says walk-ins.
We're walkin' in.

348
00:24:05,478 --> 00:24:07,478
Nah. Come back tomorrow.

349
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:09,146
I want some Nazi
shit on my arm.

350
00:24:09,148 --> 00:24:11,048
Or a big-ass
heart with some
bitch's name on it.

351
00:24:11,050 --> 00:24:12,983
Yeah, on my dick.

352
00:24:12,985 --> 00:24:16,053
We got money, old man.
It's bad business
turning us away.

353
00:24:16,055 --> 00:24:18,522
Yeah, come on, man.
Don't be judging
us by our looks.

354
00:24:18,524 --> 00:24:19,957
I'm not judging.
I'm just going to bed.

355
00:24:23,595 --> 00:24:26,630
What if I wanted her
name on my stomach?

356
00:24:26,632 --> 00:24:28,232
Lydia.

357
00:24:28,234 --> 00:24:29,834
Why don't you
all fuck off?

358
00:24:29,836 --> 00:24:29,834
We just want
to talk to her, man.

359
00:24:29,836 --> 00:24:31,936
We ain't got no
problem with you.

360
00:24:31,938 --> 00:24:33,804
What are you?
Fuckin' citizens' police?

361
00:24:33,806 --> 00:24:35,239
Get off my fuckin' property,
or I'm callin' the cops.

362
00:24:35,241 --> 00:24:36,507
Motherfucker,
you on parole.

363
00:24:36,509 --> 00:24:38,108
Nobody calls
the cops on parole!

364
00:24:38,110 --> 00:24:40,478
Don't you fucking turn
your back on me, wood!

365
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:45,983
Straight question, kid.
Can the police handle this?

366
00:24:45,985 --> 00:24:47,985
No, dad,
they'll kill me in jail!
And I won't make it.

367
00:24:47,987 --> 00:24:48,886
And I don't
know what to do!

368
00:24:48,888 --> 00:24:50,020
No shit.

369
00:24:52,492 --> 00:24:53,691
That fuckin' punk
puts a dent in my door,
I'll kick the crap...

370
00:24:53,693 --> 00:24:55,526
I really fucked up.

371
00:24:58,231 --> 00:25:00,731
Shit! Happy birthday, link.

372
00:25:00,733 --> 00:25:02,867
It's good to finally
meet your friends!

373
00:25:02,869 --> 00:25:05,102
Yeah, Kirby, you heard right.
Party at my place.

374
00:25:06,939 --> 00:25:09,273
I'm gonna get blamed for this.
Breakin' parole. Guaranteed.

375
00:25:09,275 --> 00:25:10,975
Dad!

376
00:25:10,977 --> 00:25:13,811
What the fuck?
Son of a bitch.
Shit stain!

377
00:25:13,813 --> 00:25:16,146
Get the fuck outta here!

378
00:25:16,148 --> 00:25:19,049
There it is,
aggravated assault.
Return to custody.

379
00:25:22,221 --> 00:25:23,988
See? I missed 'em for ya.

380
00:25:23,990 --> 00:25:25,556
Attempted murder,
that's what they'll say.

381
00:25:25,558 --> 00:25:27,057
Thanks for looking
me up, kid.

382
00:25:27,059 --> 00:25:28,792
Dad, these guys
are fucking psycho.

383
00:25:28,794 --> 00:25:29,693
You think so?

384
00:25:33,698 --> 00:25:37,701
I'll see you on the inside,
you chickenshit motherfucker!

385
00:25:48,847 --> 00:25:52,850
Hey, kid, they must've
run out of bullets.

386
00:25:58,024 --> 00:25:59,623
Fuck. Hang on!

387
00:26:14,673 --> 00:26:16,740
Are you dead yet,
motherfucker?

388
00:26:16,742 --> 00:26:18,309
You okay?

389
00:26:18,311 --> 00:26:21,312
Do you hear me?
I told you not to
turn your fucking back!

390
00:26:21,314 --> 00:26:23,213
We coming to get you,
motherfucker!

391
00:26:25,850 --> 00:26:27,051
Who is that?

392
00:26:27,053 --> 00:26:28,185
It's the
neighborhood watch.

393
00:26:29,788 --> 00:26:31,655
You boys picked
the wrong rednecks.

394
00:26:31,657 --> 00:26:32,790
You go tell
your boys and girls

395
00:26:32,792 --> 00:26:34,858
to put they
hockey sticks away.

396
00:26:34,860 --> 00:26:36,894
Tell me, is that
shit still loaded?

397
00:26:36,896 --> 00:26:37,895
I don't know,
let's find out.

398
00:26:39,130 --> 00:26:40,898
Come on, man.
Let's go.

399
00:26:40,900 --> 00:26:44,001
You know what,
i admire you all,

400
00:26:44,003 --> 00:26:47,071
for protecting this fine
trailer park community.

401
00:26:47,073 --> 00:26:49,139
Come on, <i> ese,</i> come on.

402
00:26:49,141 --> 00:26:51,609
You know what?
This one right here,

403
00:26:52,711 --> 00:26:55,346
I'm gonna call it a tie.

404
00:26:55,348 --> 00:26:56,947
I'll see you,
all right?

405
00:27:10,295 --> 00:27:11,829
They will be back.

406
00:27:12,263 --> 00:27:13,864
John!

407
00:27:15,034 --> 00:27:16,800
You okay?
Fuck!

408
00:27:27,712 --> 00:27:30,414
Easy, easy, easy.
Are you hurt?
There's glass everywhere.

409
00:27:33,952 --> 00:27:35,653
Fuck, this place
sucked before!

410
00:27:35,655 --> 00:27:37,421
John,
what's going on?

411
00:27:38,289 --> 00:27:40,024
Who are those guys?

412
00:27:40,026 --> 00:27:40,024
Yeah, who are
those fucking guys?

413
00:27:40,026 --> 00:27:44,328
Talk to me, buddy.
Tell me what's going on?

414
00:27:44,330 --> 00:27:47,931
Kirby, thank you! Come on.

415
00:27:47,933 --> 00:27:49,767
Wait, you're leaving
a crime scene?

416
00:27:49,769 --> 00:27:52,202
Kid's up to her neck in it,
i can't give her up.

417
00:27:52,204 --> 00:27:54,004
John, you gotta wait
for the cops! John...

418
00:27:54,006 --> 00:27:56,073
Cops, yeah, we know
how that's gonna turn out.
Fucking cops!

419
00:27:56,075 --> 00:27:59,043
John, you've always
listened to me
when it counted.

420
00:27:59,045 --> 00:28:00,411
And I'll keep listening,
but not here.

421
00:28:00,413 --> 00:28:01,712
I'll call you from the road,
Kirby, promise.

422
00:28:01,714 --> 00:28:03,914
Sober as the judge.

423
00:28:03,916 --> 00:28:06,050
John, it's really
hard to be your sponsor.

424
00:28:09,754 --> 00:28:10,421
Oh.

425
00:28:11,256 --> 00:28:13,090
Don't do this to me.

426
00:28:14,759 --> 00:28:16,160
Not now,
you piece of shit.

427
00:28:17,796 --> 00:28:19,096
Don't do this to me.

428
00:28:25,704 --> 00:28:28,472
Come on.
You damn fucking...

429
00:28:28,474 --> 00:28:30,240
I'm sorry, dad.
God.

430
00:28:31,776 --> 00:28:33,243
I'm so sorry.

431
00:28:39,851 --> 00:28:40,951
Yeah.

432
00:28:46,992 --> 00:28:47,891
Fuck.

433
00:29:05,110 --> 00:29:07,444
I knew those
guys from their ink.

434
00:29:07,446 --> 00:29:10,013
There were two <i> sureños.</i>

435
00:29:10,015 --> 00:29:11,215
And the white guy
with the "pen-1,"

436
00:29:11,217 --> 00:29:13,183
that's "public
enemy number one."

437
00:29:13,185 --> 00:29:15,219
He's with the enforcement
arm of the brotherhood.

438
00:29:15,221 --> 00:29:17,755
Though they're not proud,
they work with eme,

439
00:29:17,757 --> 00:29:21,058
but only if there's
real money involved.

440
00:29:21,060 --> 00:29:23,761
I got no idea
how you pissed
guys like that off.

441
00:29:23,763 --> 00:29:25,529
You maybe talking to
the feds, or something?

442
00:29:25,531 --> 00:29:28,232
No. No, no, no.
I'm not talking
to anybody but you.

443
00:29:30,402 --> 00:29:33,103
Yeah, I know.
You never stop,
but you don't say anything.

444
00:29:33,105 --> 00:29:36,140
See, that was supposed
to be an easy hit.

445
00:29:36,142 --> 00:29:37,808
Take you out in
the desert, rape ya,

446
00:29:37,810 --> 00:29:39,343
put a bullet
in your brain,

447
00:29:39,345 --> 00:29:41,979
have a bologna sandwich.
Make a real day of it.

448
00:29:43,848 --> 00:29:45,349
What do they
want from you?

449
00:29:46,985 --> 00:29:48,318
Fuck!

450
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:49,453
I'm afraid of
what you'll think.

451
00:29:49,455 --> 00:29:51,822
Oh. I understand.

452
00:29:51,824 --> 00:29:53,090
You don't wanna
spoil the good impression
you made so far.

453
00:29:58,930 --> 00:30:00,264
It's not that funny.

454
00:30:00,266 --> 00:30:02,800
Oh, my god!
I'm gonna pee
in my pants, dad.

455
00:30:05,804 --> 00:30:09,473
You good? You all done?
All wrung out? Finished?

456
00:30:10,408 --> 00:30:11,875
What's wrong with you?

457
00:30:11,877 --> 00:30:13,210
It's time to
cut the shit.

458
00:30:13,212 --> 00:30:15,145
What the fuck was so
wrong at your mother's,

459
00:30:15,147 --> 00:30:16,947
that you had to run
away with those guys?

460
00:30:16,949 --> 00:30:18,549
No, god!
I left home a while ago.

461
00:30:18,551 --> 00:30:20,417
I didn't even
know those guys.

462
00:30:20,419 --> 00:30:21,985
They sure seemed
to know you.

463
00:30:21,987 --> 00:30:24,822
Yeah, they worked
for my boyfriend.

464
00:30:24,824 --> 00:30:28,192
He was businessman,
he was in real estate.

465
00:30:28,194 --> 00:30:30,828
You tryin' to tell me
we're being
chased by realtors?

466
00:30:30,830 --> 00:30:34,097
No. Well,
he managed properties.
Mmm-hmm.

467
00:30:34,099 --> 00:30:39,236
See, I met him at
this party and we just
had this connection.

468
00:30:39,238 --> 00:30:42,306
He was older,
he was like 30
and he was really a man.

469
00:30:42,308 --> 00:30:44,208
Fuck.

470
00:30:44,210 --> 00:30:47,277
I was living in
a friend's walk-in closet,
at the time.

471
00:30:47,279 --> 00:30:49,246
And he wanted to help,

472
00:30:49,248 --> 00:30:52,349
so, he set me up
in this cute little
cottage in the valley.

473
00:30:52,351 --> 00:30:57,588
And all I had to do was take
care of it and look normal.
Mmm-hmm.

474
00:30:57,590 --> 00:31:02,025
Except, his people
would hide
stuff in the house.

475
00:31:02,027 --> 00:31:04,595
Like drugs, money,
stuff like that.

476
00:31:04,597 --> 00:31:08,165
So, he made you
window dressing at
one of his stash houses.

477
00:31:08,167 --> 00:31:09,933
No, he really
cared about me, dad.

478
00:31:09,935 --> 00:31:12,336
He didn't mean for this.
I am the one who fucked up.

479
00:31:12,338 --> 00:31:15,138
Kid, you got the mind-set
of a battered housewife.

480
00:31:15,140 --> 00:31:17,608
This one night,
i had friends
over at the house

481
00:31:17,610 --> 00:31:19,142
and things just blew up.

482
00:31:19,144 --> 00:31:21,578
Someone broke
the sliding glass door

483
00:31:21,580 --> 00:31:24,081
and some dick
put his fist
through a wall and...

484
00:31:24,083 --> 00:31:26,283
Something goes missing.
Mmm-hmm.

485
00:31:26,285 --> 00:31:28,252
That's what
my boyfriend said.
Mmm-hmm.

486
00:31:28,254 --> 00:31:31,154
The people he
worked for were furious.

487
00:31:31,156 --> 00:31:34,291
But I swear,
i never saw anything.

488
00:31:34,293 --> 00:31:37,160
You didn't know.
Nothing? That's the truth.
No.

489
00:31:37,162 --> 00:31:38,228
Yes.

490
00:31:40,098 --> 00:31:42,900
Then he took me
to another house,

491
00:31:42,902 --> 00:31:46,637
where, I guess,
the tenants had stolen
money out of the walls,

492
00:31:51,075 --> 00:31:53,210
and he wanted me
to kill this woman.

493
00:31:53,212 --> 00:31:55,946
Maybe to show
that I would do
anything for him.

494
00:31:57,382 --> 00:32:01,685
And I had the
gun in my hand,
and I didn't think.

495
00:32:01,687 --> 00:32:05,355
I just turned,
and I pulled the trigger.

496
00:32:05,357 --> 00:32:06,523
Fuck.

497
00:32:08,626 --> 00:32:09,593
And I...

498
00:32:11,195 --> 00:32:13,330
I killed him.

499
00:32:13,332 --> 00:32:15,132
You killed the boyfriend...
The guy?

500
00:32:15,134 --> 00:32:16,199
Yes.

501
00:32:18,636 --> 00:32:20,270
Fuck.

502
00:32:43,628 --> 00:32:46,063
And are you guys
gonna need any help
with any luggage tonight?

503
00:32:46,065 --> 00:32:47,631
Nope.
All right.
Traveling light.

504
00:32:49,167 --> 00:32:50,067
Receipt.

505
00:32:52,403 --> 00:32:54,504
Hey, man,
where'd you find her?

506
00:32:54,506 --> 00:32:57,641
In the fucking
delivery room.

507
00:32:57,643 --> 00:33:02,312
Yeah, that's... okay.
Well, got your room
with two double beds.

508
00:33:02,314 --> 00:33:05,315
Checkout's at 11:00
and complimentary
breakfast served till 10:00.

509
00:33:05,317 --> 00:33:07,284
This part's a little tricky,
so I'll show you.

510
00:33:07,286 --> 00:33:11,288
You're just gonna loop
all the way around to 216.

511
00:33:11,290 --> 00:33:12,222
That's you.

512
00:33:13,725 --> 00:33:15,659
I can show
you if you want.

513
00:33:15,661 --> 00:33:17,294
Yeah...
No, that's all right.

538
00:34:47,518 --> 00:34:47,517
Missing link tattoo.

stuff in the bathroom.

Don't forget that
because there's

What the hell is this?

547

Did you get the stuff
in the bathroom?
Yeah, I got your shit.

548
00:35:20,185 --> 00:35:21,351
Good, 'cause the
cops are coming.

549
00:35:21,353 --> 00:35:23,887
Actually, they might
be here already.

550
00:35:23,889 --> 00:35:25,589
So, this cocksucker
called the cops?

551
00:35:25,591 --> 00:35:27,724
No, god, dad!
He's helping us.

552
00:35:27,726 --> 00:35:29,860
Somebody's nice
to you and you call
him a cocksucker?

553
00:35:29,862 --> 00:35:31,795
It's all right,
i got thick skin.

554
00:35:33,297 --> 00:35:34,664
Hey, you know,
i came on at 10:00.

555
00:35:34,666 --> 00:35:35,699
That was already
there when I got here,

556
00:35:35,701 --> 00:35:37,234
but knowing the day guy...

557
00:35:37,236 --> 00:35:40,504
Fuck! Get the fuck down!

558
00:35:40,506 --> 00:35:42,472
Day guy always
fucks the night guy.

559
00:35:42,474 --> 00:35:43,807
Shut up!

560
00:35:45,377 --> 00:35:48,411
They're everywhere.
We're gonna
need a new ride.

561
00:35:50,915 --> 00:35:54,718
Okay, I really
shouldn't do this,
but room 103's open,

562
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:56,353
they won't see if
you take the back door.

563
00:35:56,355 --> 00:35:59,689
Here. I didn't see you,
you didn't see me.

564
00:35:59,691 --> 00:36:01,591
And you're
the sweetest person
that I never met.

565
00:36:20,444 --> 00:36:22,946
Grab the vin.
We'll call it in.
All right.

566
00:36:22,948 --> 00:36:24,514
They're gonna
impound the Nova.

567
00:36:26,651 --> 00:36:28,251
Dad.
Yeah.

568
00:36:28,253 --> 00:36:29,419
What's jail like?

569
00:36:30,655 --> 00:36:32,455
It's like summer camp.
I'm serious.

570
00:36:32,457 --> 00:36:33,890
Yeah, they got
a big swimming pool.

571
00:36:33,892 --> 00:36:35,792
If you're good,
they let you ride a pony.

572
00:36:35,794 --> 00:36:38,862
The cocksucker told 'em.
They're gonna
search every room.

573
00:36:38,864 --> 00:36:41,231
Do they protect people?

574
00:36:41,233 --> 00:36:42,899
They're going into
that room we were in.

575
00:36:46,437 --> 00:36:48,238
Like if somebody
was after me,

576
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:50,307
would they make
sure I was okay?

577
00:36:50,309 --> 00:36:52,776
Like a special cage,
or something?

578
00:36:52,778 --> 00:36:55,779
Yeah, that's called PC.
It's for snitches
and celebrities.

579
00:36:55,781 --> 00:36:57,514
Yeah, maybe you'll be both.

580
00:36:57,516 --> 00:37:00,684
Police! Open up!

581
00:37:00,686 --> 00:37:03,587
I can't get caught, dad.
I won't make it.

582
00:37:03,589 --> 00:37:05,222
Yeah, I know.

583
00:37:05,224 --> 00:37:07,891
You stick with me,
I'm not going
back either, okay?

584
00:37:12,464 --> 00:37:14,397
Who the fuck is in there?
Go! Go, go, go!

585
00:37:33,384 --> 00:37:34,551
Who the fuck is that?

586
00:37:37,021 --> 00:37:39,589
Dad! Dad, dad, dad!

587
00:37:39,591 --> 00:37:41,024
I haven't done
this in a long time.

588
00:37:43,527 --> 00:37:44,494
Oh, fuck!

589
00:37:48,266 --> 00:37:50,767
Oh, my god! Dad!

590
00:37:50,769 --> 00:37:51,868
Lower your weapon!

591
00:37:56,007 --> 00:37:57,340
Dad! Dad!

592
00:37:58,743 --> 00:38:00,443
Oh, my god! Dad!

593
00:38:00,445 --> 00:38:02,545
Come on! Hurry!

594
00:38:06,018 --> 00:38:07,717
Go, go, go!

595
00:38:22,466 --> 00:38:24,934
What the fuck was that?

596
00:38:24,936 --> 00:38:27,337
Our first family car,
and now we gotta dump it.

597
00:38:27,339 --> 00:38:28,838
That guy with the ink
all over his face?

598
00:38:28,840 --> 00:38:30,740
That wasn't some
gangbanger, baby.

599
00:38:30,742 --> 00:38:34,377
That was a <i> sicario.</i>
Cartel soldier.

600
00:38:34,379 --> 00:38:35,945
Used to hittin'
cops and judges.

601
00:38:35,947 --> 00:38:38,014
This boyfriend you killed?

602
00:38:38,016 --> 00:38:41,518
I heard the whole
goddamn love story,
now, what's his name?

603
00:39:42,113 --> 00:39:43,713
Going on a year
out of the joint,

604
00:39:43,715 --> 00:39:45,648
and here I am in
a truck full of Mexicans.

605
00:40:00,564 --> 00:40:03,666
How do you spend
your entire life in
the California penal system

606
00:40:03,668 --> 00:40:05,034
and not speak
any Spanish?

607
00:40:05,036 --> 00:40:06,603
What do you mean by that?

608
00:40:10,941 --> 00:40:12,509
What, you organizing
a fucking union?

609
00:40:12,511 --> 00:40:14,177
What do you
have against them?

610
00:40:14,179 --> 00:40:15,512
Nothing.

611
00:40:16,180 --> 00:40:18,114
Well, okay.

612
00:40:18,116 --> 00:40:19,816
Okay, well, they come
up here, they're illegal
and they take my job.

613
00:40:19,818 --> 00:40:22,452
Ah. So, you pick
oranges for a living?

614
00:40:22,454 --> 00:40:23,720
Nope, but I'm sure
someone does.

615
00:40:23,722 --> 00:40:25,488
Nope, not true.

616
00:40:25,490 --> 00:40:27,791
In fact, I bet you
that no white person

617
00:40:27,793 --> 00:40:31,694
has ever picked
a piece of fruit
off of a tree, ever.

618
00:40:31,696 --> 00:40:32,896
What about Eve?

619
00:40:32,898 --> 00:40:33,963
Eve was not white.

620
00:40:33,965 --> 00:40:35,665
Oh, fuck.

621
00:40:35,667 --> 00:40:38,134
What? You think
that the garden of
Eden was in Norway?

622
00:40:41,472 --> 00:40:42,439
Okay.

623
00:40:48,045 --> 00:40:49,813
Here.

624
00:40:53,717 --> 00:40:56,953
I gotta ask about
somebody inside here,
so you just wait.

625
00:40:56,955 --> 00:41:00,557
This is a bar, dad.
You're the one who
needs a chaperone.

626
00:41:00,559 --> 00:41:02,225
I'll be fine,
just stay out here.

627
00:41:14,905 --> 00:41:17,507
She ain't 21, boss.

628
00:41:17,509 --> 00:41:19,476
I'm looking for
a guy named tom Harris,

629
00:41:19,478 --> 00:41:20,510
people used to
call him "preacher."

630
00:41:20,512 --> 00:41:21,244
He still come here?

631
00:41:23,247 --> 00:41:24,814
Look, I'm an
old buddy of his,

632
00:41:24,816 --> 00:41:26,249
I'm just trying to
hook up with him again.

633
00:41:26,251 --> 00:41:28,718
Does this look
like a dating service?

634
00:41:33,858 --> 00:41:35,058
Good enough for me.

635
00:41:35,060 --> 00:41:36,125
What'll you have?

636
00:41:40,030 --> 00:41:41,631
She's having water.

637
00:41:41,633 --> 00:41:43,533
He lived in the foothills,
last I heard.

638
00:41:43,535 --> 00:41:45,768
One of the originals,
Fontana chapter.

639
00:42:05,290 --> 00:42:08,124
So, then the flea wakes up
and he's back in
the hells angels mustache...

640
00:42:08,126 --> 00:42:10,693
Kirby, I'm in a bar.

641
00:42:10,695 --> 00:42:11,828
<i> Oh, John.</i>

642
00:42:11,830 --> 00:42:13,830
Well, that's not
the worst of it.

643
00:42:13,832 --> 00:42:15,565
There's some
serious fucking
people tailing us

644
00:42:15,567 --> 00:42:16,900
and I don't know how.

645
00:42:18,637 --> 00:42:20,169
What does the guy say?

646
00:42:20,171 --> 00:42:22,672
Look at that
ass car go.

647
00:42:22,674 --> 00:42:25,208
This fucking
kid's a carnival, man.

648
00:42:25,210 --> 00:42:28,545
She's every
loser's lucky day.

649
00:42:28,547 --> 00:42:29,579
Look, I'm goin'
to preacher's.

650
00:42:29,581 --> 00:42:31,814
I'm heading there.

651
00:42:31,816 --> 00:42:33,216
<i> John, I felt like</i>
<i> you were the first</i>
<i> person I really helped.</i>

652
00:42:33,218 --> 00:42:34,918
<i> That's the god's</i>
<i> honest truth.</i>

653
00:42:34,920 --> 00:42:34,918
Well, yeah, I know.

654
00:42:34,920 --> 00:42:38,588
Look, I'm not dying, kirb.
I'm just in El centro.

655
00:42:38,590 --> 00:42:40,123
<i> Look, tell me</i>
<i> where you are,</i>

656
00:42:40,125 --> 00:42:41,724
<i> give me an address,</i>
<i> I'm gonna come get you.</i>

657
00:42:43,761 --> 00:42:45,028
I'll call you back, okay?

658
00:42:45,030 --> 00:42:46,262
<i> Wait, John, no.</i>

659
00:42:47,598 --> 00:42:49,299
Excuse me, buddy.

660
00:42:49,301 --> 00:42:50,333
Easy, boss.
Oh, my...

661
00:42:50,335 --> 00:42:51,834
What is the matter?

662
00:42:51,836 --> 00:42:53,703
God!

663
00:42:53,705 --> 00:42:55,772
You pulled my arm
out of its socket.

664
00:42:57,174 --> 00:42:58,841
What?
Are you relapsing?

665
00:42:58,843 --> 00:42:59,742
What, you wanna
talk, talk here.

666
00:42:59,744 --> 00:43:00,977
Away from those animals.

667
00:43:00,979 --> 00:43:02,211
Okay. Look.

668
00:43:04,582 --> 00:43:08,318
I've been thinking
and I have a plan.

669
00:43:08,320 --> 00:43:10,620
I know that
it's a crime not
to report a crime,

670
00:43:10,622 --> 00:43:12,889
but other than that,
what have you done?

671
00:43:12,891 --> 00:43:14,724
I mean,
that warrant is for me.

672
00:43:14,726 --> 00:43:16,259
You could go home.

673
00:43:16,261 --> 00:43:19,596
You could just tip
the trailer back and <i> voila.</i>

674
00:43:19,598 --> 00:43:22,332
I don't have to
take you down with me.

675
00:43:22,334 --> 00:43:24,100
I was talking to these guys

676
00:43:24,102 --> 00:43:26,736
and I think that
i can cross the border
at otay mesa.

677
00:43:26,738 --> 00:43:28,638
Pretty little white
chick down in Tijuana,

678
00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:30,173
with no money and
a price on her head.

679
00:43:30,175 --> 00:43:32,008
Now that's a hell
of a plan, Lydia.

680
00:43:32,010 --> 00:43:33,376
You don't think
i could take
care of myself?

681
00:43:33,378 --> 00:43:35,812
Hell, no. Not even
in this dump here,

682
00:43:35,814 --> 00:43:38,815
let alone in Guadalajara
or some other turd
factory down south.

683
00:43:38,817 --> 00:43:40,183
Within a week,
you'll be turning tricks.

684
00:43:42,620 --> 00:43:44,087
That is the most
insulting thing

685
00:43:44,089 --> 00:43:45,855
that anybody has
ever said to me.

686
00:43:45,857 --> 00:43:47,223
Well, I bet it's not.

687
00:43:47,225 --> 00:43:48,291
How else are you
gonna make money?

688
00:43:56,066 --> 00:43:57,967
Look, look, kid.
I'm just...

689
00:43:57,969 --> 00:44:00,336
I'm just trying to help you
think straight, all right?

690
00:44:00,338 --> 00:44:03,306
I know what it's like
to have the shit come
down on you, okay?

691
00:44:03,308 --> 00:44:05,308
People get caught
when they make mistakes

692
00:44:05,310 --> 00:44:09,012
and I just don't want you
to do anything stupid, okay?

693
00:44:09,014 --> 00:44:10,913
About all
i know is running.

694
00:44:10,915 --> 00:44:13,416
You spent nine
years in prison.

695
00:44:13,418 --> 00:44:14,283
How the fuck
is that running?

696
00:44:14,285 --> 00:44:16,285
Okay, surviving.

697
00:44:19,123 --> 00:44:22,892
I just wanted
you to go back
to your little place

698
00:44:22,894 --> 00:44:25,161
and not have to
do any more time.

699
00:44:25,996 --> 00:44:27,664
I'm a murderer, dad.

700
00:44:29,266 --> 00:44:32,001
Yeah, I know you are, kid.

701
00:44:32,003 --> 00:44:34,937
And you'll face god
for it and so will I.

702
00:44:35,873 --> 00:44:37,040
But not yet.

703
00:44:38,909 --> 00:44:41,310
You let me let you
in on a little secret.

704
00:44:41,312 --> 00:44:43,413
I haven't had so
much fun since I was 15,

705
00:44:43,415 --> 00:44:45,948
stole a car and
drove to Miami beach.

706
00:44:45,950 --> 00:44:47,884
This shit's a party
to a dirtbag like me.

707
00:44:47,886 --> 00:44:51,187
So, stop feeling
sorry for yourself
and start listening.

708
00:44:51,189 --> 00:44:53,156
This buddy of mine,

709
00:44:53,158 --> 00:44:55,725
he's rich,
he's got connections
and he owes me.

710
00:44:55,727 --> 00:44:58,061
Now, he'll help us if
i can find out where he is,
i don't know.

711
00:44:58,063 --> 00:44:59,362
And these
skid-marks over here,

712
00:44:59,364 --> 00:45:01,130
they know but
they're not talkin' and...

713
00:45:02,466 --> 00:45:04,200
I got the address.

714
00:45:18,949 --> 00:45:20,149
Thank you!

715
00:45:24,154 --> 00:45:26,055
Gonna hop up
through there.

716
00:45:29,493 --> 00:45:30,893
There's a lot of
firepower around here,

717
00:45:30,895 --> 00:45:32,228
but there's a lot
of bullshit, too.

718
00:45:32,230 --> 00:45:33,963
Here, hop through here.

719
00:45:35,867 --> 00:45:37,967
Fuck you.
That's not funny.

720
00:45:39,069 --> 00:45:40,837
More bullshit?

721
00:45:40,839 --> 00:45:42,405
No, those are
probably real.

722
00:45:42,407 --> 00:45:43,740
Follow me.

723
00:45:48,213 --> 00:45:50,246
Coming.

724
00:46:07,030 --> 00:46:08,197
Son of a bitch.

725
00:46:08,199 --> 00:46:09,332
That's me.

726
00:46:09,334 --> 00:46:10,366
So, they let you out.

727
00:46:10,368 --> 00:46:11,434
This is my daughter.

728
00:46:12,970 --> 00:46:15,772
They do grow up,
don't they?

729
00:46:15,774 --> 00:46:20,143
Well, you might as well
go on inside the hangar
and say hi to him.

730
00:46:20,145 --> 00:46:22,278
Careful, you don't
give him a heart attack.

731
00:46:37,561 --> 00:46:39,228
One of those yours?

732
00:46:39,230 --> 00:46:40,863
Yeah, in another life.

733
00:46:44,101 --> 00:46:45,268
Fuck.

734
00:46:58,015 --> 00:46:59,415
Hey.

735
00:47:01,185 --> 00:47:04,220
Be with you in a minute.
Let me just finish up here.

736
00:47:08,926 --> 00:47:12,595
Well. I expected you
two years ago.

737
00:47:12,597 --> 00:47:15,498
Yeah, stingy parole board,
you know how it is.

738
00:47:16,500 --> 00:47:18,167
It's my daughter, Lydia.

739
00:47:18,169 --> 00:47:19,435
You're kidding.

740
00:47:21,471 --> 00:47:23,906
Lee, I knew you when
you were just a pup.

741
00:47:23,908 --> 00:47:25,208
How are you, sweetie?

742
00:47:25,210 --> 00:47:26,509
I'm fine, thanks.

743
00:47:30,113 --> 00:47:32,148
Yeah.
Mmm-hmm.

744
00:47:32,150 --> 00:47:33,282
Still backing
the losers,

745
00:47:33,284 --> 00:47:35,418
I see.
Nazis and confederates.

746
00:47:35,420 --> 00:47:39,255
Yeah, yeah,
all losers make me money.
Let me show you around.

747
00:47:47,998 --> 00:47:50,199
So, what's this
collectibles horseshit
a front for?

748
00:47:50,201 --> 00:47:53,035
You selling down south?
Ak-47s and the like?

749
00:47:53,037 --> 00:47:57,440
No, no, I don't
sell that commie shit.

750
00:47:57,442 --> 00:47:59,442
You know the walls
along the border?

751
00:47:59,444 --> 00:48:02,311
They're building them
with the landing
pads we used in 'nam.

752
00:48:02,313 --> 00:48:04,313
Think about that.

753
00:48:04,315 --> 00:48:07,183
That metal
i used to jump on
in the rice paddies,

754
00:48:07,185 --> 00:48:10,086
they're using now
to keep the taco
vendors off my lawn.

755
00:48:10,088 --> 00:48:11,988
So, who you
selling to these days?

756
00:48:11,990 --> 00:48:14,991
You know,
i love you
like a son, link.

757
00:48:14,993 --> 00:48:17,393
But I'm not gonna
answer questions

758
00:48:17,395 --> 00:48:19,462
from somebody
i haven't seen
in a coon's age.

759
00:48:20,497 --> 00:48:22,932
We had a deal.

760
00:48:22,934 --> 00:48:24,467
I want my bike back
and I want my money.

761
00:48:24,469 --> 00:48:25,668
Which money is that?

762
00:48:25,670 --> 00:48:28,271
I kept my mouth
shut a long time.

763
00:48:28,273 --> 00:48:30,506
You were always the
strong, silent type.

764
00:48:32,142 --> 00:48:33,576
You know, the boys
should be by later on.

765
00:48:33,578 --> 00:48:35,177
Why don't you hang around,
play catch up?

766
00:48:35,179 --> 00:48:37,680
What the fuck for?
I've been sober two years.

767
00:48:37,682 --> 00:48:41,217
Well, maybe someone
would like to witness that
with their own eyes.

768
00:49:00,237 --> 00:49:01,604
Yeah! Shit!

769
00:49:07,010 --> 00:49:08,311
Well, can i
get you anything?

770
00:49:08,313 --> 00:49:09,612
A soda,
or something maybe?

771
00:49:10,247 --> 00:49:11,514
I'm fine.

772
00:49:11,516 --> 00:49:14,383
Yo, baby!
Come here!

773
00:49:14,385 --> 00:49:17,153
I bet you feel
like you're surrounded
by savages.

774
00:49:17,155 --> 00:49:20,723
No. No, I really
appreciate everything.
Thank you.

775
00:49:20,725 --> 00:49:22,091
You do? Huh?

776
00:49:22,093 --> 00:49:25,161
Mmm.

777
00:49:25,163 --> 00:49:26,629
I bet you don't
know what the hell
you're looking at,

778
00:49:26,631 --> 00:49:28,464
or listening to.

779
00:49:28,466 --> 00:49:33,369
These are the last
of the survivors.
The last of the kind.

780
00:49:33,371 --> 00:49:36,038
They know this
little patch of desert's
gonna be here

781
00:49:36,040 --> 00:49:39,542
long after the rest
of this country
cannibalizes itself.

782
00:49:39,544 --> 00:49:42,578
Okay and why is
that gonna happen?

783
00:49:43,246 --> 00:49:45,414
Okay, well,

784
00:49:45,416 --> 00:49:47,149
it'll happen because

785
00:49:47,151 --> 00:49:49,652
most of you people
are too goddamn
comfortable to see it.

786
00:49:49,654 --> 00:49:52,254
You kids don't understand.

787
00:49:52,256 --> 00:49:56,225
This country buys
out the subversives.

788
00:49:56,227 --> 00:50:00,363
It turns the rebels
into fashion trends.

789
00:50:00,365 --> 00:50:04,166
It did it with the angels,
it's doing it with rap.

790
00:50:04,168 --> 00:50:07,770
And the corporations
package it up
and sell it online.

791
00:50:07,772 --> 00:50:11,774
Hundred dollars a t-shirt
for suburban little
princesses just like you.

792
00:50:14,544 --> 00:50:18,681
You know what?
You grew up
with your mama.

793
00:50:18,683 --> 00:50:21,150
You never knew the world
your daddy rode in.

794
00:50:21,152 --> 00:50:23,552
But your mama
wasn't always rich.

795
00:50:23,554 --> 00:50:25,421
She started out with us.

796
00:50:25,423 --> 00:50:28,657
But she married
up the ladder.

797
00:50:28,659 --> 00:50:32,294
She became a hood
ornament for the best cars.

798
00:50:32,296 --> 00:50:33,763
How long you
been away from home?

799
00:50:36,233 --> 00:50:38,067
I know all about
why little rich girls

800
00:50:38,069 --> 00:50:40,302
leave their
pretty things behind.

801
00:50:41,271 --> 00:50:43,706
When a mosquito bites you,

802
00:50:43,708 --> 00:50:47,443
it leaves an enzyme
that other
mosquitos can smell.

803
00:50:47,445 --> 00:50:49,512
And I can smell
it on you, kid.

804
00:50:49,514 --> 00:50:51,547
Everyone can.

805
00:50:51,549 --> 00:50:54,050
So, you can run forever.

806
00:50:54,684 --> 00:50:56,752
Forever.

807
00:50:56,754 --> 00:50:59,722
But the worst and, I mean,
the worst goddamn
people in the world

808
00:50:59,724 --> 00:51:01,824
know that scent
and they'll follow it.

809
00:51:01,826 --> 00:51:03,192
Can you dig it?

810
00:51:15,539 --> 00:51:17,273
Yeah.

811
00:51:17,275 --> 00:51:20,176
Sorry to leave you out
there with them animals,

812
00:51:20,178 --> 00:51:21,343
but I was keepin'
an eye on ya.

813
00:51:23,613 --> 00:51:25,347
So, is this the old hog?

814
00:51:25,349 --> 00:51:26,649
This is her.

815
00:51:28,085 --> 00:51:31,554
'97 softail with
a 570 lift cam.

816
00:51:31,556 --> 00:51:32,822
Shaved the fenders,
chromed the front

817
00:51:32,824 --> 00:51:34,123
and dropped her
two inches.

818
00:51:34,125 --> 00:51:35,391
Beautiful.
Hmm.

819
00:51:35,393 --> 00:51:36,792
I feel kind
of jealous,

820
00:51:36,794 --> 00:51:38,394
I thought
i was an only child.

821
00:51:40,565 --> 00:51:42,164
Do you think
he's gonna give
it back to you?

822
00:51:42,166 --> 00:51:44,266
Oh, kid, he owes me
a lot more than this.

823
00:51:44,268 --> 00:51:45,601
I did a seven
year stretch,

824
00:51:45,603 --> 00:51:48,170
keeping quiet for
that motherfucker.

825
00:51:48,172 --> 00:51:51,640
Then I got done again
for shanking
some fucking nobody.

826
00:51:51,642 --> 00:51:52,808
Otherwise I'd have been out.

827
00:51:55,679 --> 00:51:57,880
You got raised by
three stepfathers.

828
00:51:57,882 --> 00:51:59,548
Should've been me.

829
00:52:05,122 --> 00:52:07,590
I don't know
what to tell you.

830
00:52:07,592 --> 00:52:09,825
So many enemies,
so many vendettas.

831
00:52:09,827 --> 00:52:13,562
Fills up your
fucking soul, you know?

832
00:52:13,564 --> 00:52:16,799
Play this game
with its own set
of stupid fucking rules.

833
00:52:17,901 --> 00:52:20,169
You give your life to it,

834
00:52:21,805 --> 00:52:23,239
it's over.

835
00:52:24,708 --> 00:52:27,710
And I got nothing
to show for it.

836
00:52:27,712 --> 00:52:29,879
There's nothing
i can even say,

837
00:52:31,815 --> 00:52:31,814
except I'm sorry.

838
00:52:34,784 --> 00:52:38,254
I made mistakes
and you suffered.

839
00:52:38,256 --> 00:52:40,623
I'm sorry I wasn't
there for you, baby.

840
00:52:58,208 --> 00:52:59,642
Morning, link.

841
00:53:05,282 --> 00:53:07,216
What the fuck
is wrong with you?

842
00:53:07,218 --> 00:53:09,385
Wake the kid.
Yeah.

843
00:53:09,387 --> 00:53:12,688
This is a loaded
firearm and I will shoot.

844
00:53:12,690 --> 00:53:15,758
The past is long gone.
Yeah, okay.

845
00:53:19,529 --> 00:53:20,896
Hey, baby.

846
00:53:20,898 --> 00:53:23,232
Wake up,
rise and shine.

847
00:53:23,234 --> 00:53:24,700
Hey. Cut it out,
will you?

848
00:53:24,702 --> 00:53:26,936
Quit it. Just...

849
00:53:26,938 --> 00:53:26,936
Honey, you gotta wake up.

850
00:53:26,938 --> 00:53:31,674
Okay, there's some kind
of kidnapping going on.
I don't know.

851
00:53:32,777 --> 00:53:33,842
Fuck.

852
00:53:33,844 --> 00:53:35,244
I'm up.

853
00:53:35,246 --> 00:53:37,813
You gotta
be shittin' me.

854
00:53:37,815 --> 00:53:38,948
No, I'm not shittin' ya.

855
00:53:38,950 --> 00:53:40,616
Things have
changed, <i> hombre.</i>

856
00:53:40,618 --> 00:53:43,686
I can't let an opportunity
like this slide by.

857
00:53:43,688 --> 00:53:46,255
See a nickel on
the ground these days,
you pick it up.

858
00:53:46,257 --> 00:53:48,591
For 30 grand.

859
00:53:48,593 --> 00:53:52,361
Yeah, well, 30 g's
will fill a lot of holes
around here, <i> compadre.</i>

860
00:53:52,363 --> 00:53:54,597
I do appreciate your
loyalty in the past.

861
00:53:54,599 --> 00:53:56,398
I really do.

862
00:53:56,400 --> 00:53:58,267
But we gotta be
professional about this.

863
00:53:58,269 --> 00:54:00,936
We're not gonna
turn you in.

864
00:54:00,938 --> 00:54:03,706
We're gonna follow
the letter of the law.

865
00:54:03,708 --> 00:54:06,809
She can run on home
to her gold-digging mama

866
00:54:06,811 --> 00:54:08,711
and you're free to go.

867
00:54:08,713 --> 00:54:11,647
Take a hike.
Hit the road, Jack.
Know what I mean?

868
00:54:11,649 --> 00:54:12,681
You fucking virus.

869
00:54:12,683 --> 00:54:14,016
If you turn us in,

870
00:54:14,018 --> 00:54:15,484
the cops will bust you.
Shut up!

871
00:54:15,486 --> 00:54:18,787
Goddamn brat!

872
00:54:18,789 --> 00:54:20,422
I was running
the fucking
Coachella valley

873
00:54:20,424 --> 00:54:23,759
before you were an itch
in your daddy's sack!

874
00:54:24,728 --> 00:54:24,727
So, don't tell me.

875
00:54:24,729 --> 00:54:29,331
My life isn't an instagram,
for Christ's sake.

876
00:54:29,333 --> 00:54:30,833
I'm in the fucking
history books!

877
00:54:30,835 --> 00:54:34,903
Vietnam, 19th engineer
combat battalion,
look it up.

878
00:54:34,905 --> 00:54:37,539
Look it up!

879
00:54:37,541 --> 00:54:39,408
I've dug up more
fucking mines

880
00:54:39,410 --> 00:54:40,843
that I could've blown
the moon up with!

881
00:54:40,845 --> 00:54:42,845
Do you understand that?

882
00:54:42,847 --> 00:54:44,613
Get the fuck outta here!
Get 'em out of here, cherise,

883
00:54:44,615 --> 00:54:47,016
before I lose my
goddamn Patience.
Get 'em outta here!

884
00:54:47,018 --> 00:54:49,018
Keep talking,
you senile motherfucker.

885
00:54:49,020 --> 00:54:50,886
Motherfucker?
Yeah.

886
00:54:50,888 --> 00:54:52,521
I wouldn't be
if you keep your
mother home at night!

887
00:54:52,523 --> 00:54:54,456
Fuck you!
How'd you feel
with a fucking bayonet

888
00:54:54,458 --> 00:54:56,625
in your cracked skull,
you old cock-sucking...

889
00:54:56,627 --> 00:54:57,693
Shit!

890
00:54:57,695 --> 00:54:59,328
Get outta here!

891
00:54:59,330 --> 00:55:01,063
Here's your Nazi bullshit!

892
00:55:01,065 --> 00:55:02,898
Calm down!

893
00:55:06,336 --> 00:55:08,804
Let me tell
you something, pal.

894
00:55:08,806 --> 00:55:11,006
I still love you.

895
00:55:11,008 --> 00:55:13,075
You were
the best foot soldier
i ever fucking had.

896
00:55:13,077 --> 00:55:14,643
How 'bout I shoot
you right now?

897
00:55:14,645 --> 00:55:15,844
With your daughter
right outside?
Yeah, I might.

898
00:55:15,846 --> 00:55:18,347
No, you won't,
you can't.

899
00:55:18,349 --> 00:55:19,915
You're past that.
I watched it, I saw it.

900
00:55:19,917 --> 00:55:21,750
You've changed.

901
00:55:21,752 --> 00:55:23,752
But back in the day...

902
00:55:23,754 --> 00:55:27,456
Back in the day,
i kept my fucking mouth
shut for you, old man!

903
00:55:27,458 --> 00:55:29,458
That's what I did
back in the day.

904
00:55:29,460 --> 00:55:31,560
You were like
a fucking father to me!

905
00:55:31,562 --> 00:55:32,761
Back the fuck up!

906
00:55:32,763 --> 00:55:34,596
Roll it the fuck
back, cocksuck!

907
00:55:36,733 --> 00:55:38,901
You know
what I'm looking for.
Where's my keys?

908
00:55:38,903 --> 00:55:41,103
See what we got here.

909
00:55:41,105 --> 00:55:42,905
What're you doin'?
Stealing from me, link?

910
00:55:42,907 --> 00:55:45,741
Stealing? You stole every
goddamn thing I ever had.

911
00:55:45,743 --> 00:55:48,110
Everything!

912
00:55:48,112 --> 00:55:50,646
Now look at you.
You're so fucking
broke and pathetic,

913
00:55:50,648 --> 00:55:52,514
I can't even
kill you for it.

914
00:55:52,516 --> 00:55:54,516
You even stole
that from me!

915
00:55:57,520 --> 00:55:58,721
Stay put.

916
00:56:30,620 --> 00:56:31,687
Dad!

917
00:56:33,823 --> 00:56:33,822
Fuck!

918
00:56:33,824 --> 00:56:37,393
Go! Well, they're
fucking shooting at us!

919
00:57:13,863 --> 00:57:14,930
The gun!

920
00:57:34,584 --> 00:57:36,118
We're good, kid.
Hang on to me.
Oh, shit!

921
00:57:57,574 --> 00:57:59,741
- Yeah, good idea.
- Okay.

922
00:57:59,743 --> 00:58:00,809
Hey, kid.

923
00:58:04,647 --> 00:58:06,748
We gotta shake a leg,
you comin'?

924
00:58:10,753 --> 00:58:14,890
Hey, Kirby.
I'm just checking in.
I'll call you back, okay?

925
00:58:14,892 --> 00:58:16,658
Can't give you
a number here.
We're on the road.

926
00:58:33,176 --> 00:58:36,612
We're safe,
sober, both of us.

927
00:58:36,614 --> 00:58:38,514
Call you back.
Thanks, man.

928
00:58:47,790 --> 00:58:49,057
Hey, look, kid,
you're crashing now.

929
00:58:49,059 --> 00:58:50,559
Maybe you
should take a nap?

930
00:58:52,729 --> 00:58:57,165
Do you ever think about
what the world would
be like without you?

931
00:58:57,167 --> 00:59:00,736
If I just went ahead
and killed myself,
this would all be over.

932
00:59:00,738 --> 00:59:02,905
Oh, so,
that's where we're at.

933
00:59:02,907 --> 00:59:04,740
Givin' up. Fine.

934
00:59:04,742 --> 00:59:06,975
You kill yourself,
then I'll kill myself.

935
00:59:06,977 --> 00:59:09,778
I'll take some
innocent people with me.
How'd that be?

936
00:59:09,780 --> 00:59:12,247
You think I'm kidding,
dad, but I've tried.

937
00:59:12,249 --> 00:59:13,815
Yeah, so have I,
plenty of times.

938
00:59:13,817 --> 00:59:15,183
Where does that get us?

939
00:59:15,185 --> 00:59:18,120
I took all of my
stepdad's pills
when I was 12.

940
00:59:18,122 --> 00:59:19,788
Girls take pills
when they want
somebody to find 'em.

941
00:59:19,790 --> 00:59:22,891
I tried to hang myself
when I was 10-years-old.

942
00:59:22,893 --> 00:59:24,159
Well, that didn't
work very well.

943
00:59:24,161 --> 00:59:25,861
Do you understand
what I'm trying to tell you?

944
00:59:25,863 --> 00:59:27,029
Yeah, sure,
congratulations.

945
00:59:27,031 --> 00:59:28,664
I was 10-years-old!

946
00:59:28,666 --> 00:59:30,299
Yeah, I knew
a 10-year-old kid.

947
00:59:30,301 --> 00:59:31,833
Killed his whole
family with a rock.

948
00:59:33,636 --> 00:59:34,803
What the fuck
does that mean?

949
00:59:34,805 --> 00:59:36,071
Why don't you
ever listen to me?

950
00:59:36,073 --> 00:59:37,839
I'm listening, okay?

951
00:59:37,841 --> 00:59:41,043
Look, feel this,
right up here.
No.

952
00:59:41,045 --> 00:59:43,879
Yes. Come on,
it's important.
Feel it, come on.

953
00:59:43,881 --> 00:59:46,214
Oh, my god!
What is that?

954
00:59:46,216 --> 00:59:49,618
Yeah, drove my bike
off a cliff on the pch,
split my head wide open.

955
00:59:49,620 --> 00:59:51,286
Now, the point is,
i meant to do it.

956
00:59:51,288 --> 00:59:52,955
But they saved
my ass anyway

957
00:59:52,957 --> 00:59:54,990
and that's a steel
plate in my head.

958
00:59:54,992 --> 00:59:56,925
And look at this.
No, I don't want to.

959
00:59:56,927 --> 00:59:58,994
You're a fucking cyborg.

960
00:59:58,996 --> 01:00:01,363
I opened up my
wrist in prison,
then I got sepsis.

961
01:00:01,365 --> 01:00:03,765
Spent two months in
the prison hospital

962
01:00:03,767 --> 01:00:06,068
watching game shows
and then I really
wanted to kill myself.

963
01:00:06,070 --> 01:00:07,369
All right, you win.

964
01:00:07,371 --> 01:00:07,369
No, no, no.
There's no
winning or losing.

965
01:00:07,371 --> 01:00:11,106
You either wanna
wake up in the morning,
or you don't.

966
01:00:11,108 --> 01:00:12,741
And if you can't find
a way to live with yourself,

967
01:00:12,743 --> 01:00:14,843
well then, why run?

968
01:00:14,845 --> 01:00:16,311
Why come to me?
Why do any of this?

969
01:00:18,815 --> 01:00:20,816
I don't wanna die.
What was that?

970
01:00:20,818 --> 01:00:22,217
I don't wanna die.

971
01:00:22,219 --> 01:00:23,819
That's right.
You don't wanna die.

972
01:00:23,821 --> 01:00:24,953
'Cause you're
a 17-year-old kid

973
01:00:24,955 --> 01:00:27,222
and you got a lot
to live for. Okay?

974
01:00:27,224 --> 01:00:29,091
You may not wanna
wake up tomorrow,

975
01:00:29,093 --> 01:00:32,327
but the day after
that might just be great.

976
01:00:32,329 --> 01:00:34,396
Might be the best fucking
day of your life, you know?

977
01:00:34,398 --> 01:00:35,764
You don't wanna
miss it, right?

978
01:00:47,810 --> 01:00:49,211
Great, keep doing the hair.

979
01:00:49,213 --> 01:00:50,846
I'll be back in
an hour or two,
i got a meeting.

980
01:00:50,848 --> 01:00:52,814
I need to talk
to an old friend.

981
01:00:52,816 --> 01:00:54,816
If something happens to you,
how am I gonna know?

982
01:00:54,818 --> 01:00:56,184
I'll give you
Kirby's number, okay?

983
01:00:56,186 --> 01:00:57,953
If something happens,
you call Kirby...

984
01:00:57,955 --> 01:01:00,188
So, if we get separated,
I'm supposed to
call your sponsor?

985
01:01:00,190 --> 01:01:02,190
Kid, look.
This is something
i really need to do.

986
01:01:02,192 --> 01:01:03,792
I promise
I'll come back.

987
01:01:03,794 --> 01:01:05,961
I'll be back before
you're a blonde, okay?

988
01:01:05,963 --> 01:01:07,262
Okay.
See ya.

989
01:01:51,107 --> 01:01:52,140
I lost my ID.

990
01:01:53,342 --> 01:01:54,376
Here to see rios.

991
01:01:57,914 --> 01:01:58,814
I know.

992
01:02:35,985 --> 01:02:37,285
- Dad?
<i>- Lydia?</i>

993
01:02:38,321 --> 01:02:41,523
Kirby? What happened?

994
01:02:41,525 --> 01:02:43,158
<i> Is your</i>
<i> father there?</i>

995
01:02:43,160 --> 01:02:47,095
No, he's not back yet.
Did he call you?

996
01:02:47,097 --> 01:02:50,966
<i> Yeah, earlier, he did.</i>
<i> He told me</i>
<i> you were in yuma.</i>

997
01:02:50,968 --> 01:02:53,168
<i> Listen, I'm worried about him,</i>
<i> I'm worried about both of you.</i>

998
01:02:53,170 --> 01:02:55,036
Is he in trouble?

999
01:02:55,038 --> 01:02:57,305
<i> I don't think</i>
<i> it's safe for you</i>
<i> to be there alone.</i>

1000
01:02:57,307 --> 01:03:00,342
<i> I think you should go</i>
<i> to a public place,</i>
<i> someplace crowded.</i>

1001
01:03:00,344 --> 01:03:04,079
<i> Don't trust anybody, Lydia.</i>
<i> Stay in a crowd.</i>
<i> Listen to your instincts.</i>

1002
01:03:11,087 --> 01:03:11,086
You missed me so much,

1003
01:03:11,088 --> 01:03:14,089
I have to pull strings
to get you back inside?

1004
01:03:14,091 --> 01:03:16,792
Conjugal visit.
Kiss me, no tongues.

1005
01:03:24,967 --> 01:03:27,068
How are ya?

1006
01:03:27,070 --> 01:03:28,937
You are one ugly dude.

1007
01:03:28,939 --> 01:03:31,139
Shit! You look like
a public defender.

1008
01:03:31,141 --> 01:03:33,241
Yeah.

1009
01:03:33,243 --> 01:03:35,210
Please grow back
the beard, please!

1010
01:03:35,212 --> 01:03:35,210
I need your help, man.

1011
01:03:35,212 --> 01:03:38,113
Yeah, you need me to
teach you to tie a tie.

1012
01:03:38,115 --> 01:03:40,248
No, no, no.
It's my little girl.

1013
01:03:40,250 --> 01:03:42,250
That guy I asked you about.
Did you get the message?

1014
01:03:42,252 --> 01:03:45,954
Nephew of Alfonso
angel-Diaz. <i> El padrino.</i>

1015
01:03:45,956 --> 01:03:48,957
Still running
the family business
from his cell in juarez.

1016
01:03:48,959 --> 01:03:51,860
The kid was keeping stash
houses for him in la.

1017
01:03:51,862 --> 01:03:53,094
The cartel sent him
there to get rid of him.

1018
01:03:53,096 --> 01:03:55,096
He was too loud,
too proud,

1019
01:03:55,098 --> 01:03:56,598
causing problems
with the family.

1020
01:03:56,600 --> 01:03:59,100
Well, he was causing problems
for my little girl, too.

1021
01:03:59,102 --> 01:04:00,402
He's not with us anymore.

1022
01:04:00,404 --> 01:04:02,037
So, you don't need
a paternity test?

1023
01:04:02,039 --> 01:04:04,105
No, but I do need
protection for her.

1024
01:04:04,107 --> 01:04:05,307
Any of his crew
sets foot inside,

1025
01:04:05,309 --> 01:04:06,842
they won't make
it across the yard.

1026
01:04:06,844 --> 01:04:08,844
Yeah, but there's some
professional on her tail.

1027
01:04:08,846 --> 01:04:10,111
Some cleaner from
south of the border.

1028
01:04:10,113 --> 01:04:12,180
This punk accused
her of stealing.

1029
01:04:12,182 --> 01:04:14,249
Now, I thought it
was just his guys
that wanted her dead,

1030
01:04:14,251 --> 01:04:17,352
but it's more than that.
Why would they send
this kind of firepower?

1031
01:04:18,988 --> 01:04:20,989
Don't you get it, bro?

1032
01:04:20,991 --> 01:04:23,358
Jonah was taking
the money

1033
01:04:23,360 --> 01:04:25,560
and I'm not
talking a few grand,
I'm talking millions.

1034
01:04:25,562 --> 01:04:28,029
And he was
pinning it on her
and his other tenants.

1035
01:04:28,031 --> 01:04:29,464
Okay.

1036
01:04:29,466 --> 01:04:31,066
Thought she was
an easy fucking mark.

1037
01:04:31,068 --> 01:04:33,969
But you know what?
He's lucky he's dead.

1038
01:04:33,971 --> 01:04:36,004
'Cause what they
would do to him,
be a lot worse, bro.

1039
01:04:36,006 --> 01:04:38,039
A lot worse.

1040
01:04:38,041 --> 01:04:40,008
Anybody sets foot
on the inside,
I'll deal with it.

1041
01:04:40,010 --> 01:04:42,344
You need a line
to <i> El padrino,</i>
I'll get it for you.

1042
01:04:42,346 --> 01:04:44,980
But you gotta teach
your girl some judgment.

1043
01:04:44,982 --> 01:04:47,949
Then you gotta
teach her how to hide.

1044
01:04:47,951 --> 01:04:49,384
She gotta
live right, brother,
clean and straight.

1045
01:04:49,386 --> 01:04:52,287
'Cause people like this,
they can see in the dark.

1046
01:04:52,289 --> 01:04:55,190
You got to teach her
how to stay in the sunlight.

1047
01:05:00,363 --> 01:05:01,396
Stay loose, bro.

1048
01:05:01,398 --> 01:05:02,931
Get loose.

1049
01:05:02,933 --> 01:05:04,299
Doing my best.

1050
01:05:16,646 --> 01:05:18,380
Hello.

1051
01:05:18,382 --> 01:05:19,514
<i> Lydia?</i>

1052
01:05:21,550 --> 01:05:23,184
<i> You didn't expect</i>
<i> it to be me?</i>

1053
01:05:26,489 --> 01:05:27,956
Jonah?

1054
01:05:29,292 --> 01:05:30,959
<i> How's the movie?</i>

1055
01:05:33,296 --> 01:05:34,696
What movie?

1056
01:05:34,698 --> 01:05:37,532
<i> You always</i>
<i> lie like a child.</i>

1057
01:05:37,534 --> 01:05:40,635
<i> I can see you right now.</i>
<i> I'm watching.</i>

1058
01:05:44,974 --> 01:05:47,709
No, you're tracking
my phone.

1059
01:05:47,711 --> 01:05:50,045
<i> You think I'm</i>
<i> using a fucking app?</i>

1060
01:05:51,981 --> 01:05:55,317
<i> You have no idea</i>
<i> what I lived through.</i>

1061
01:05:55,319 --> 01:05:59,154
<i> Underground doctors,</i>
<i> blood transfusions.</i>

1062
01:05:59,156 --> 01:06:02,524
<i> I don't ever get to live</i>
<i> in the regular world anymore.</i>

1063
01:06:04,226 --> 01:06:06,261
I'm sorry.

1064
01:06:06,263 --> 01:06:09,531
<i> Fuck you.</i>
<i> We're so far past that.</i>

1065
01:06:09,533 --> 01:06:12,033
<i> But you want to see</i>
<i> your father again?</i>

1066
01:06:13,269 --> 01:06:16,371
<i> You come talk to</i>
<i> me face to face.</i>

1067
01:06:18,507 --> 01:06:19,441
You're lying.

1068
01:06:19,443 --> 01:06:20,742
<i> Turn around.</i>

1069
01:06:34,590 --> 01:06:37,125
I didn't know what
i was doing, Jonah.

1070
01:06:38,361 --> 01:06:40,428
It's like
i wasn't even there.

1071
01:06:40,430 --> 01:06:42,130
I can't live
with myself, okay?

1072
01:06:42,132 --> 01:06:43,698
I don't know what
else I can say to you.

1073
01:06:46,369 --> 01:06:47,702
I was good to you, Lydia.

1074
01:06:50,606 --> 01:06:52,540
I put you
in a nice place.

1075
01:06:54,310 --> 01:06:57,379
I gave you
everything you needed.

1076
01:06:57,381 --> 01:07:01,182
I took better care of you
than anybody in your life.

1077
01:07:04,253 --> 01:07:05,387
And you tried to kill me.

1078
01:07:06,789 --> 01:07:08,656
Look, come...

1079
01:07:12,161 --> 01:07:13,728
This is still bleeding.

1080
01:07:16,232 --> 01:07:17,332
Come here.

1081
01:07:17,334 --> 01:07:18,533
No.

1082
01:07:18,535 --> 01:07:21,102
I have your
name on my heart

1083
01:07:21,104 --> 01:07:23,071
and you can't even
come close to me?

1084
01:07:23,073 --> 01:07:23,772
Where is he?

1085
01:07:26,675 --> 01:07:30,612
You try to run,
and we're gonna
have to kill you.

1086
01:07:34,418 --> 01:07:35,483
Hey!

1087
01:07:36,719 --> 01:07:38,053
Lydia!

1088
01:08:08,250 --> 01:08:10,251
Come on, kid. Pick up.

1089
01:08:11,787 --> 01:08:13,788
Where are you, kid?
Come on.

1090
01:08:15,257 --> 01:08:16,324
Fuck.

1091
01:08:17,359 --> 01:08:18,493
Okay.

1092
01:08:29,805 --> 01:08:31,339
Come on, Kirby,
come on.

1093
01:08:40,282 --> 01:08:42,283
Kirby!
What're you doing, man?

1094
01:08:42,285 --> 01:08:44,419
What's happening? Kirby?

1095
01:08:44,421 --> 01:08:46,788
Good news, old man.

1096
01:08:46,790 --> 01:08:51,593
Your sponsor says
you should start
drinking again.

1097
01:08:51,595 --> 01:08:52,527
Who the fuck is this?

1098
01:08:54,196 --> 01:08:55,730
Talk to your friend.

1099
01:08:55,732 --> 01:08:57,799
Hello? Kirby?

1100
01:08:59,368 --> 01:09:01,769
Sorry, Johnny.
I did my best.

1101
01:09:07,276 --> 01:09:09,177
The fuck? Kirby?

1102
01:09:09,179 --> 01:09:09,844
<i> Kirby?</i>

1103
01:09:14,617 --> 01:09:16,818
You had a snitch for
a sponsor, old man.

1104
01:09:18,187 --> 01:09:20,255
You know who I am?

1105
01:09:20,257 --> 01:09:23,191
<i> I know your daughter</i>
<i> better than you do.</i>

1106
01:09:23,193 --> 01:09:25,160
<i> You should've taught</i>
<i> her to shoot straight.</i>

1107
01:09:26,295 --> 01:09:27,629
So, you're not dead.

1108
01:09:31,267 --> 01:09:34,435
You just killed
the best fucking friend
i ever had, motherfucker!

1109
01:09:34,437 --> 01:09:35,670
<i> No, that's no friend.</i>

1110
01:09:35,672 --> 01:09:37,338
You fill him with
a bottle of Tequila

1111
01:09:37,340 --> 01:09:39,574
and he can't
keep a secret.

1112
01:09:39,576 --> 01:09:42,510
Where's Lydia? You got Lydia?
Where the fuck is Lydia?

1113
01:09:43,846 --> 01:09:45,246
She might be dead.

1114
01:09:47,783 --> 01:09:49,951
No. No, she's not.

1115
01:09:51,820 --> 01:09:54,222
You're a fucking psycho,
but you know one thing.

1116
01:09:54,224 --> 01:09:55,590
She's the last
streak of sunlight

1117
01:09:55,592 --> 01:09:57,458
you're ever gonna see
in your whole fucking life.

1118
01:09:57,460 --> 01:09:59,460
Shut the fuck up.
You know nothing about me.

1119
01:09:59,462 --> 01:10:02,330
Yeah, I do.
I know all about you.

1120
01:10:02,332 --> 01:10:04,232
That's why you're gonna
stay on the fucking phone.

1121
01:10:04,234 --> 01:10:05,934
<i> Whatever you're</i>
<i> gonna do with Lydia,</i>

1122
01:10:05,936 --> 01:10:07,902
you need to do
something else first.

1123
01:10:07,904 --> 01:10:10,238
You need
to deal with me.

1124
01:10:10,240 --> 01:10:12,974
Really? Why should
i give a shit about you?

1125
01:10:12,976 --> 01:10:14,809
Well, 'cause I know
what you're doin'.

1126
01:10:14,811 --> 01:10:16,544
I know about your family
and the money you took.

1127
01:10:16,546 --> 01:10:18,279
<i> Yeah? You hear me?</i>

1128
01:10:19,715 --> 01:10:21,249
I heard you.

1129
01:10:21,251 --> 01:10:22,684
You're killing people
to cover your tracks.

1130
01:10:22,686 --> 01:10:25,553
Make a big fucking show
to prove it's not you.

1131
01:10:25,555 --> 01:10:27,488
Lydia told me
about the houses,
she told me everything.

1132
01:10:27,490 --> 01:10:30,391
<i> And I got a line straight to</i>
<i> your uncle in fucking juarez.</i>

1133
01:10:30,393 --> 01:10:32,227
El padrino,
<i> you know him.</i>

1134
01:10:32,229 --> 01:10:35,230
I know he doesn't
think too much of you.

1135
01:10:35,232 --> 01:10:35,230
I can get
a message to him.

1136
01:10:35,232 --> 01:10:38,800
You're still on the phone
because you know this is real.

1137
01:10:38,802 --> 01:10:40,802
<i> And you know he's</i>
<i> already watching you.</i>

1138
01:10:40,804 --> 01:10:43,238
You think he's
letting you use one
of his best <i> sicarios,</i>

1139
01:10:43,240 --> 01:10:46,608
that zapotecan
monster with you?
Just for you?

1140
01:10:46,610 --> 01:10:48,643
He's there
to keep track of you,
too, motherfuck!

1141
01:10:48,645 --> 01:10:50,311
<i> He gets the order</i>
<i> from uncle,</i>

1142
01:10:50,313 --> 01:10:52,247
bang, he takes
your fucking head off.

1143
01:10:52,249 --> 01:10:53,615
You're a businessman, yeah?

1144
01:10:53,617 --> 01:10:55,717
<i> This is the best deal</i>
<i> you're ever gonna get.</i>

1145
01:10:55,719 --> 01:10:57,585
You kill me first.

1146
01:10:57,587 --> 01:10:58,519
Kill me in front of her,
if you have to.

1147
01:10:58,521 --> 01:10:59,854
Let's just meet.

1148
01:10:59,856 --> 01:11:01,956
And you trust
me to let her go
when you die?

1149
01:11:01,958 --> 01:11:04,392
I don't fucking
trust you at all.

1150
01:11:04,394 --> 01:11:06,661
All I'm asking of you
to do is keep her alive
until I see her again.

1151
01:11:09,031 --> 01:11:13,935
Okay. That's sweet.
The old man wants
his last chance.

1152
01:11:13,937 --> 01:11:16,904
I'll call you in 10
minutes to this number
and give you a meeting point.

1153
01:11:16,906 --> 01:11:18,673
No, you put her on
the phone or no deal.

1154
01:11:18,675 --> 01:11:20,041
Put her on the fucking
phone right now!

1155
01:11:26,949 --> 01:11:28,016
Okay.

1156
01:11:29,551 --> 01:11:30,918
Dad!

1157
01:11:30,920 --> 01:11:32,587
Baby, I'm coming for you.
Have a little faith.

1158
01:11:32,589 --> 01:11:34,022
That's it.
Okay, get in there.

1159
01:12:13,495 --> 01:12:15,330
I can't believe
you'd have the nerve.

1160
01:12:17,733 --> 01:12:18,833
Fucker.

1161
01:12:23,339 --> 01:12:23,338
<i> Okay, old man,</i>

1162
01:12:23,340 --> 01:12:27,041
<i> leave highway 78</i>
<i> at mile marker 114,</i>

1163
01:12:27,043 --> 01:12:28,609
<i> head north</i>
<i> into the desert.</i>

1164
01:12:28,611 --> 01:12:29,677
<i> Alone, no guns.</i>

1165
01:13:51,059 --> 01:13:53,494
What the
fuck is he doing?

1166
01:13:53,496 --> 01:13:54,695
He's showing us
he ain't strapped.

1167
01:13:57,433 --> 01:13:58,533
Let's get
this shit over with.

1168
01:14:02,871 --> 01:14:04,439
Move away
from your bike!

1169
01:14:08,911 --> 01:14:09,944
Nice and slow.

1170
01:14:10,746 --> 01:14:12,547
Lydia!

1171
01:14:12,549 --> 01:14:14,182
Stop there. Stop!

1172
01:14:16,051 --> 01:14:17,552
Spread your legs.

1173
01:14:17,554 --> 01:14:18,453
Spread your
fucking legs!

1174
01:14:22,090 --> 01:14:23,524
Put your fucking
hands together!

1175
01:14:31,500 --> 01:14:33,034
Come on, get him in.
We're going for a ride,

1176
01:14:33,036 --> 01:14:35,102
just in case
you were followed.
Move. Move!

1177
01:14:35,104 --> 01:14:36,737
Come on, get in.

1178
01:14:42,177 --> 01:14:44,111
You will see her,
you will see her.

1179
01:14:44,113 --> 01:14:46,047
Get in. Get in!

1180
01:14:48,217 --> 01:14:49,517
Hi, kid.

1181
01:15:00,963 --> 01:15:02,096
Go, get that.

1182
01:15:18,747 --> 01:15:20,715
Come here,
baby. Come here.

1183
01:15:37,599 --> 01:15:39,867
Fuck! Fuck you! Fuck!

1184
01:15:40,602 --> 01:15:41,636
Get him off!

1185
01:15:46,775 --> 01:15:48,209
Fuck! Fuck!

1186
01:16:12,601 --> 01:16:13,301
Fuck.

1187
01:16:27,849 --> 01:16:29,917
We gotta jam!
Motherfucker's up there!

1188
01:16:33,088 --> 01:16:34,889
Where is he?

1189
01:16:34,891 --> 01:16:36,090
You're hit.

1190
01:16:36,092 --> 01:16:37,692
Did you see him?
No.

1191
01:16:37,694 --> 01:16:39,060
Okay. Fuck.

1192
01:16:43,165 --> 01:16:45,066
Okay, I saw him that time!

1193
01:16:45,068 --> 01:16:46,867
Okay, I got an idea.

1194
01:16:46,869 --> 01:16:48,836
I'll lay down some cover fire,
you run to the other car.

1195
01:16:48,838 --> 01:16:50,771
He won't be able to
track you there, okay?
What?

1196
01:16:50,773 --> 01:16:52,340
He'll be takin' shots at me,
he won't even see you.
Get going!

1197
01:16:52,342 --> 01:16:53,608
Dad, you're hurt!

1198
01:16:53,610 --> 01:16:55,276
Get in the other
car and fuck off!

1199
01:16:55,278 --> 01:16:56,911
No, no. If you think
that I'm leaving you,

1200
01:16:56,913 --> 01:16:58,679
then you're out of
your fucking mind!

1201
01:16:58,681 --> 01:17:00,081
Do not run until
i start firing!
No!

1202
01:17:00,083 --> 01:17:01,349
I'm gonna count
to three. One!
No!

1203
01:17:01,351 --> 01:17:02,984
Two...
No!

1204
01:17:02,986 --> 01:17:04,619
Count to a million
if you want to!

1205
01:17:04,621 --> 01:17:06,287
If you think that
I'm leaving here
without you,

1206
01:17:06,289 --> 01:17:08,823
then you don't know me!

1207
01:17:08,825 --> 01:17:11,359
All this time,
and you never
even fucking knew me!

1208
01:17:12,761 --> 01:17:14,795
What? Okay. Okay.

1209
01:17:16,865 --> 01:17:19,800
It's nice to meet you.

1210
01:17:19,802 --> 01:17:22,370
Okay, I got another idea.
Let's go together.

1211
01:17:22,372 --> 01:17:23,938
On your count or mine?
Yours.

1212
01:17:23,940 --> 01:17:25,106
Okay, let's go!
Okay.

1213
01:17:25,108 --> 01:17:26,173
God...
Go, go, go!

1214
01:17:32,914 --> 01:17:34,048
Lydia!

1215
01:17:49,131 --> 01:17:50,197
Dad!

1216
01:17:50,199 --> 01:17:51,832
Hey. You okay?

1217
01:17:51,834 --> 01:17:53,834
I'm okay.
Good.

1218
01:17:55,103 --> 01:17:57,138
Oh, no! Oh, fuck!

1219
01:17:58,440 --> 01:18:00,107
Dad, he's coming.

1220
01:18:05,847 --> 01:18:07,014
I don't know
where he is.

1221
01:18:07,016 --> 01:18:09,316
Yeah, he's coming.
Come here. Come here.

1222
01:18:10,052 --> 01:18:11,752
Be still.

1223
01:18:11,754 --> 01:18:13,954
Be very, very still.
I'm so sorry.

1224
01:18:55,063 --> 01:18:57,898
I got him!
I got him! I got you!

1225
01:19:02,037 --> 01:19:03,104
Oh, shit!

1226
01:19:04,439 --> 01:19:06,841
This is not good.
Oh, fuck!

1227
01:19:06,843 --> 01:19:08,209
Dead motherfucker!

1228
01:19:10,245 --> 01:19:11,846
The other one.
Get your head down.

1229
01:19:11,848 --> 01:19:11,846
There's the other one,
the boyfriend.
Stop, stop!

1230
01:19:11,848 --> 01:19:15,015
He's out there.
Dad, he's gone.
He's gone!

1231
01:19:15,017 --> 01:19:16,317
Where did he...
He's gone, okay?

1232
01:19:16,319 --> 01:19:18,185
I gotta go get us help.

1233
01:19:18,187 --> 01:19:20,755
No, you stay here.
Don't leave me,
stay here, please.

1234
01:19:20,757 --> 01:19:21,789
Yeah.

1235
01:19:22,424 --> 01:19:24,391
Yeah, yeah.

1236
01:19:24,393 --> 01:19:26,127
Just let me
look at you.

1237
01:19:32,501 --> 01:19:34,502
Your hair
came out good.

1238
01:19:36,905 --> 01:19:41,509
Look, kid, I'm really bad.
Here, take this gun.

1239
01:19:41,511 --> 01:19:43,511
I got nothing
better to give ya.

1240
01:19:43,513 --> 01:19:45,012
I never gave
you anything

1241
01:19:45,014 --> 01:19:45,946
and now I got
nothing to give you.

1242
01:19:45,948 --> 01:19:48,149
Dad, dad!
That is not true.

1243
01:19:48,151 --> 01:19:49,250
I lost ya...

1244
01:19:49,252 --> 01:19:51,118
Dad! Look at me!
Look at me!

1245
01:19:52,287 --> 01:19:54,288
You did not lose me.

1246
01:19:54,290 --> 01:19:58,092
I am not lost,
i am right here
with you, okay? Okay?

1247
01:19:58,994 --> 01:20:01,428
I'm not gonna leave.

1248
01:20:01,430 --> 01:20:02,563
Okay?
Okay.

1249
01:20:02,565 --> 01:20:04,331
Look at me.

1250
01:20:04,333 --> 01:20:06,934
It's just you and me.
Okay.

1251
01:20:06,936 --> 01:20:09,837
I'm not gonna leave,
ever. I promise.

1252
01:20:12,474 --> 01:20:13,941
You sure are a good girl.

1253
01:20:15,177 --> 01:20:17,812
You sure are.
You sure are.

1254
01:20:21,216 --> 01:20:22,283
Dad?

1255
01:20:54,883 --> 01:20:57,218
On your knees!
Hands behind your head!

1256
01:21:02,457 --> 01:21:04,358
<i> A year ago,</i>
<i> I stopped running.</i>

1257
01:21:06,328 --> 01:21:10,631
<i> I stopped listening</i>
<i> to all of my worst instincts</i>

1258
01:21:10,633 --> 01:21:12,933
<i> and all the worst people.</i>

1259
01:21:26,348 --> 01:21:27,448
<i> I'll just tell you this.</i>

1260
01:21:29,284 --> 01:21:30,985
I've been sober a year.

1261
01:21:33,622 --> 01:21:35,890
I miss my
father so much,

1262
01:21:35,892 --> 01:21:38,459
that I can't
sleep some nights,

1263
01:21:40,495 --> 01:21:43,030
but I tell myself that
he's watching over me.

1264
01:21:46,067 --> 01:21:49,970
Sometimes,
there's this shame

1265
01:21:51,172 --> 01:21:53,007
that almost
breaks my back,

1266
01:21:55,010 --> 01:21:57,444
but I tell myself,

1267
01:21:57,446 --> 01:22:00,547
"when you owe
your life to someone,

1268
01:22:02,284 --> 01:22:03,951
"you better live it."

1269
01:22:05,253 --> 01:22:08,022
So, I just say,

1270
01:22:11,593 --> 01:22:13,027
<i> "thank you."</i>
