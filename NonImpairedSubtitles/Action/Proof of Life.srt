1
00:00:53,632 --> 00:00:57,363
This is the conclusive Kidnap andRansom
Report for Mr. Pierre Lenoir.

2
00:00:57,836 --> 00:00:59,633
Location: Chechnya.

3
00:00:59,705 --> 00:01:00,729
Result:

4
00:01:00,973 --> 00:01:01,962
Positive.

5
00:01:02,107 --> 00:01:05,099
We were contracted by AGP underwriters
who insured the victim.

6
00:01:07,312 --> 00:01:11,840
Mr. Lenoir was abducted January 21
from Russian-held territory...

7
00:01:11,917 --> 00:01:14,715
...by members ofthe Chechen
Nationalist Militia.

8
00:01:16,288 --> 00:01:19,849
Their first demand was for $5million.

9
00:01:22,694 --> 00:01:25,322
My ability to negotiate directly
with the Chechens...

10
00:01:25,397 --> 00:01:27,888
...was subverted
by Russian military command...

11
00:01:27,966 --> 00:01:29,957
...who monitoredmy every move.

12
00:01:32,137 --> 00:01:33,627
After 36 days...

13
00:01:33,772 --> 00:01:37,367
...lhadnegotiated the finalransom figure
down to $750,000.

14
00:01:38,810 --> 00:01:43,179
Finalproofoflife was received
midnight Wednesday, February 27.

15
00:01:48,387 --> 00:01:51,322
The next morning,
l was informedby the Russians...

16
00:01:51,390 --> 00:01:55,258
...that l wouldbeprohibited
from personally delivering the ransom.

17
00:01:59,231 --> 00:02:02,394
Any confidence that these men
would deliver the ransom money...

18
00:02:02,467 --> 00:02:06,335
...andreturn the hostage safely, had,
by this point, been dissipated.

19
00:02:06,471 --> 00:02:07,870
Tell your colonel...

20
00:02:07,939 --> 00:02:09,930
...it's his responsibility now.

21
00:02:10,042 --> 00:02:12,408
He's got his orders. He fucks about...

22
00:02:12,644 --> 00:02:14,874
...l'll be the least of his problems.

23
00:02:20,719 --> 00:02:24,177
Factoring the time-sensitive interests
of the group holding Lenoir...

24
00:02:24,256 --> 00:02:27,316
...the limited communication available
with the London office...

25
00:02:27,392 --> 00:02:29,053
...and the Russian insistence...

26
00:02:29,127 --> 00:02:32,324
...that they, and they alone,
deliver the ransom payment.

27
00:02:33,532 --> 00:02:36,433
lmade the decision
that there was simply no alternative...

28
00:02:36,501 --> 00:02:39,470
...but to give the Russians
exactly what they wanted.

29
00:02:47,612 --> 00:02:50,240
Knowing that l'dretain possession
ofthe ransom money...

30
00:02:50,315 --> 00:02:52,749
...l'dmanaged to contact
the Chechens privately.

31
00:02:52,818 --> 00:02:55,878
We hadagreed to rendezvous
at an alternative location.

32
00:02:57,656 --> 00:03:00,147
Transport options in this area are limited.

33
00:03:00,659 --> 00:03:01,421
Drive!

34
00:03:01,493 --> 00:03:03,484
So l did the best that l could.

35
00:03:05,664 --> 00:03:07,359
The group holding Mr. Lenoir...

36
00:03:07,432 --> 00:03:11,163
...was responsible for a dozen kidnappings
over thepast two years.

37
00:03:11,336 --> 00:03:13,566
This is a battle-testedguerrilla militia.

38
00:03:13,638 --> 00:03:17,267
They are well-armed,
highly mobile and extremely unpredictable.

39
00:03:19,978 --> 00:03:23,277
Mr. Lenoir was found to be
in an excellent state ofhealth...

40
00:03:23,348 --> 00:03:25,441
...considering the circumstances.

41
00:03:33,291 --> 00:03:36,658
l sent the Russians away.
l don't know how much time we've got.

42
00:03:36,995 --> 00:03:38,986
Following a review ofthe ransom payment.

43
00:03:39,197 --> 00:03:40,960
Mr. Lenoir was released into our care.

44
00:03:44,970 --> 00:03:49,134
The success ofthis extraction depended on
a brisk, timely, transfer schedule.

45
00:03:49,541 --> 00:03:53,033
We were, however, not quite fast enough.

46
00:04:00,152 --> 00:04:01,176
Airborne!

47
00:04:02,154 --> 00:04:04,520
Come in hot, Joe. This place is going loud!

48
00:04:06,792 --> 00:04:09,352
Evac emergency RV. Repeat, ERV.

49
00:04:30,415 --> 00:04:32,144
Airborne, l have a visual!

50
00:04:33,151 --> 00:04:36,211
There are two dead trees
in the center of the field.

51
00:04:36,288 --> 00:04:39,121
l'm 50 yards to the west of the south tree.

52
00:04:39,558 --> 00:04:43,289
Don't give me any shit, Joseph.
l've got injured cargo. Get your ass down!

53
00:05:10,388 --> 00:05:11,286
Go!

54
00:05:36,882 --> 00:05:42,115
This extraction didn't go down well
for the Chechens or our Russian hosts.

55
00:05:42,854 --> 00:05:43,946
As a result...

56
00:05:44,155 --> 00:05:47,647
...my ability to function as a Kidnap
andRansom consultant in the area...

57
00:05:47,726 --> 00:05:49,284
...has been permanently compromised.

58
00:05:50,195 --> 00:05:52,527
Mr. Lenoir was examined
by mobile medical...

59
00:05:52,597 --> 00:05:54,827
...and as per
his insurance company's request...

60
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:58,131
...transported to Athens yesterday
for surgical treatment.

61
00:05:58,370 --> 00:06:01,862
At this time, we have contracts
with all three insurance underwriters...

62
00:06:01,940 --> 00:06:05,706
...holding K and R policies
in the west-Asian, post-Soviet republics.

63
00:06:06,044 --> 00:06:09,309
This area is clearly
in a critical state of transition...

64
00:06:09,681 --> 00:06:12,650
...and demands
the most vigorous security precautions.

65
00:06:12,717 --> 00:06:15,345
What did they bill last year,
our three underwriters?

66
00:06:15,420 --> 00:06:16,717
Total premium?

67
00:06:17,255 --> 00:06:19,917
-$28 million.
-And the ransom total?

68
00:06:19,991 --> 00:06:21,959
Paid out on policies?

69
00:06:22,027 --> 00:06:23,153
$26 million.

70
00:06:23,261 --> 00:06:24,421
Bloody hell.

71
00:06:25,063 --> 00:06:28,521
Set up some premium meetings.
Wave the red flag a bit.

72
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:30,793
Excellent job, Terry. Thank you.

73
00:06:30,902 --> 00:06:32,494
As always, outstanding.

74
00:06:32,637 --> 00:06:33,535
Sir.

75
00:06:34,372 --> 00:06:36,932
Where are we next? Pakistan?

76
00:06:38,310 --> 00:06:38,969
Colombia?

77
00:07:26,725 --> 00:07:27,692
Hello.

78
00:07:28,994 --> 00:07:30,461
Peter, is that you?

79
00:07:30,595 --> 00:07:31,892
Baby, it's me.

80
00:07:31,963 --> 00:07:33,897
Can you hear me? lt's about tonight.

81
00:07:33,965 --> 00:07:35,660
l'm shopping for dinner.

82
00:07:36,001 --> 00:07:38,162
The goodnews is, l'll definitely be back.

83
00:07:38,236 --> 00:07:39,897
Yeah? Go on.

84
00:07:40,271 --> 00:07:43,763
We've got to go to this thing tonight.
The dinner. The charity event.

85
00:07:45,343 --> 00:07:46,640
You're kidding, right?

86
00:07:46,711 --> 00:07:49,077
No. l'm getting completely screwedhere.

87
00:07:49,147 --> 00:07:52,548
None ofmy equipment's here.
None ofthe stufftheypromised.

88
00:07:52,617 --> 00:07:55,780
l've got 60 guys running around thejungle
with nothing to do.

89
00:07:56,021 --> 00:07:57,716
Something is really messed up here.

90
00:07:57,789 --> 00:07:59,814
l'm going to pin
these bastards down tonight.

91
00:07:59,891 --> 00:08:03,486
You really want to put me
at a table full of oil executives?

92
00:08:04,863 --> 00:08:08,128
They're big boys. They can stand up
to a little hippie like you.

93
00:08:09,501 --> 00:08:11,128
Can l tell them what l think of them?

94
00:08:12,670 --> 00:08:14,399
lf you really want to skip it--

95
00:08:14,472 --> 00:08:17,032
No, l'll go, l'll be there.

96
00:08:18,276 --> 00:08:20,039
And l'll be on my best behavior.

97
00:08:20,478 --> 00:08:21,445
Great.

98
00:08:21,946 --> 00:08:23,811
Thank you, Alice. l mean it.

99
00:08:23,882 --> 00:08:25,975
l'llhave to borrow a dress from Norma.

100
00:08:26,051 --> 00:08:30,954
Get Sandro to drop my tux by the airfield
before he stops back andpicks you up.

101
00:08:31,022 --> 00:08:33,013
Yeah, don't worry about it.

102
00:08:33,091 --> 00:08:36,322
Please don't leave me hanging out there
with thosepeople.

103
00:08:36,461 --> 00:08:37,723
Andbe careful.

104
00:08:37,796 --> 00:08:39,286
l will. l love you.

105
00:08:48,807 --> 00:08:51,799
Peter, what's happening?
What about the equipment?

106
00:08:51,876 --> 00:08:53,434
Everything is taken care of.

107
00:08:53,511 --> 00:08:55,911
l'm meeting with the guys
from Quad Carbon tonight.

108
00:09:04,255 --> 00:09:06,917
His mom said
he was exactly the same as a baby.

109
00:09:07,025 --> 00:09:08,617
She's right, you know.

110
00:09:08,726 --> 00:09:09,818
Hey, baby.

111
00:09:11,129 --> 00:09:12,824
l was worried about you.

112
00:09:14,299 --> 00:09:16,494
-l told you he'd make it.
-Hi, Peter.

113
00:09:16,868 --> 00:09:19,496
-Let's find our tables.
-We'll see you inside.

114
00:09:26,511 --> 00:09:29,776
Look at you,
all decked out in Norma's duds.

115
00:09:29,848 --> 00:09:31,975
lt's my debut as a corporate wife.

116
00:09:33,218 --> 00:09:34,583
Whatever it is...

117
00:09:35,019 --> 00:09:36,384
...it is working.

118
00:09:37,222 --> 00:09:41,386
l'm dressing like this all the time now.
You ought to come around more often.

119
00:09:43,761 --> 00:09:46,559
-l guess l got some making up to do.
-l guess so.

120
00:10:39,684 --> 00:10:41,982
l just want to know
what the hell is going on.

121
00:10:42,053 --> 00:10:43,577
-Nobody called?
-No.

122
00:10:43,655 --> 00:10:45,145
l was there all day.

123
00:10:45,623 --> 00:10:47,648
Hey, y'all. Sorry we're late.

124
00:10:47,859 --> 00:10:50,384
-Where is everybody?
-Nobody called you?

125
00:10:50,461 --> 00:10:51,951
Are you shitting me?

126
00:10:52,063 --> 00:10:56,022
Fellner, Buddy and their gang left
for Houston this morning. A powwow.

127
00:10:56,100 --> 00:11:00,594
Peggy said if he was going, she was going.
l guess all the girls jumped on that.

128
00:11:00,672 --> 00:11:02,071
So, it's just us.

129
00:11:03,274 --> 00:11:04,935
Better late than never.

130
00:11:05,843 --> 00:11:07,401
So, lvy tell you?

131
00:11:07,712 --> 00:11:08,701
Houston.

132
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:12,213
This morning. All of them.
Fellner chartered a plane.

133
00:11:12,283 --> 00:11:13,580
What's in Houston?

134
00:11:13,651 --> 00:11:14,743
New money.

135
00:11:26,631 --> 00:11:27,996
Peter, look.

136
00:11:38,943 --> 00:11:40,877
How did it get so bad so fast?

137
00:11:40,945 --> 00:11:42,776
Come on, man.

138
00:11:43,114 --> 00:11:44,809
Where the hell have you been?

139
00:11:44,882 --> 00:11:46,782
l've been trying to build a dam.

140
00:11:46,851 --> 00:11:49,684
Pick your head up every now and then,
take a look around.

141
00:11:49,754 --> 00:11:52,052
You're building a charity water project.

142
00:11:52,123 --> 00:11:55,650
As for the company, you're nothing
but a humanitarian window-dressing.

143
00:11:55,727 --> 00:11:59,424
Quad Carbon came down here looking
for a lucky break and we got nailed.

144
00:11:59,731 --> 00:12:02,996
We've a billion-dollar pipeline
that hasn't spit out a gallon yet.

145
00:12:03,067 --> 00:12:06,798
Oil prices are going through the roof.
We can't take advantage of it.

146
00:12:07,972 --> 00:12:10,099
You know, market close today...

147
00:12:10,174 --> 00:12:13,666
...Quad Carbon stock down $10 and falling.

148
00:12:14,412 --> 00:12:16,471
The vultures are circling.

149
00:12:17,015 --> 00:12:18,846
Which vulture is in Houston?

150
00:12:18,983 --> 00:12:20,211
lt's Octonal.

151
00:12:20,351 --> 00:12:23,787
They're the only ones big enough
to come and get this thing on track.

152
00:12:23,855 --> 00:12:25,254
Peter, look!

153
00:12:30,161 --> 00:12:31,321
Peter, look!

154
00:12:39,170 --> 00:12:42,606
Maybe you missed it,
but this happens to be a big deal for me.

155
00:12:43,308 --> 00:12:44,775
l think l know that.

156
00:12:45,943 --> 00:12:47,808
You sure don't act like it.

157
00:12:48,546 --> 00:12:52,038
Maybe it's a sign. Maybe it's just a sign
that we should go home.

158
00:12:52,116 --> 00:12:56,416
You tell me. This all falls apart,
this goes away, what was the point?

159
00:12:57,121 --> 00:13:00,784
-The point of what?
-l don't know. How about everything?

160
00:13:01,059 --> 00:13:04,460
How about Africa? How about Egypt?
How about Thailand?

161
00:13:04,696 --> 00:13:08,496
How about eight years of shit postings?
Eight years of working for assholes.

162
00:13:08,566 --> 00:13:11,364
Eight years of working
on somebody else's bad ideas.

163
00:13:11,469 --> 00:13:13,494
Wait. l don't get it here.

164
00:13:13,871 --> 00:13:16,772
Suddenly the last eight years,
that's just all shit now?

165
00:13:16,841 --> 00:13:18,638
-ls that what l said?
-l thought...

166
00:13:18,710 --> 00:13:20,678
...we were doing what we wanted to do.

167
00:13:20,745 --> 00:13:22,770
l thought we were living our lives together.

168
00:13:22,847 --> 00:13:25,475
That's not what l said.
This isn't just a job!

169
00:13:25,783 --> 00:13:29,219
This is everything
l have prepared for my entire life!

170
00:13:30,788 --> 00:13:35,691
lf Jerry's right, if it's Octonal, they come in
and take this over, l'm fucked!

171
00:13:38,096 --> 00:13:40,223
l wouldn't get too upset about it.

172
00:13:40,465 --> 00:13:42,990
Maybe Octonal wants a dam
of their very own.

173
00:13:43,067 --> 00:13:45,160
Octonal doesn't build dams, they kick ass.

174
00:13:45,236 --> 00:13:47,966
They don't care about these people.
lt's all about profits.

175
00:13:48,039 --> 00:13:52,305
l don't get it. What is the surprise here?
You wanted to work for an oil company.

176
00:13:52,377 --> 00:13:55,369
l don't work for an oil company.
That's not what l'm doing here!

177
00:13:55,446 --> 00:13:57,641
l'm building a dam
that will save people's lives!

178
00:13:57,715 --> 00:14:02,084
You are building a dam so an oil company
can get a pipeline contract.

179
00:14:02,220 --> 00:14:05,986
-Who cares who pays for it?
-Apparently, no one!

180
00:14:07,925 --> 00:14:09,256
You're drunk.

181
00:14:10,428 --> 00:14:12,487
No, Peter.

182
00:14:12,630 --> 00:14:14,291
This isn't us.

183
00:14:14,866 --> 00:14:16,959
-Let's just go home.
-Great.

184
00:14:17,535 --> 00:14:20,265
That is so supportive.

185
00:14:21,005 --> 00:14:23,064
You don't like this place either.

186
00:14:23,141 --> 00:14:25,405
-l like the project.
-l don't have a project!

187
00:14:25,476 --> 00:14:27,774
Then find a fucking project!

188
00:14:30,581 --> 00:14:31,707
Damn.

189
00:14:33,918 --> 00:14:36,182
Use your talent, your experience.

190
00:14:37,922 --> 00:14:41,289
There's got to be 25 agencies
working down here.

191
00:14:41,359 --> 00:14:43,623
There's food projects, health-care projects.

192
00:14:43,694 --> 00:14:46,891
Any one of them would be thrilled
to have you on their staff.

193
00:14:47,165 --> 00:14:48,496
l don't get this.

194
00:14:48,766 --> 00:14:51,530
You've hit the ground running
every place we've ever gone.

195
00:14:51,602 --> 00:14:54,662
l'm sorry l'm not bouncing back
fast enough for you.

196
00:14:54,872 --> 00:14:58,467
Five months here, you haven't even started
to learn the language.

197
00:14:58,709 --> 00:15:01,473
l am not getting pregnant again
in the Third World.

198
00:15:01,546 --> 00:15:03,241
No, not Africa.

199
00:15:03,481 --> 00:15:06,314
We're not gonna bring that into this.

200
00:15:06,784 --> 00:15:08,479
-''That''?
-Yes, that.

201
00:15:08,886 --> 00:15:12,151
When the hell are you gonna move on?
lt's over. lt happened.

202
00:15:12,223 --> 00:15:16,284
-lt wasn't meant to be. Get over it!
-l don't want to move on!

203
00:15:16,461 --> 00:15:20,295
Well, l have. And goddamn it,
l'm right here. Right now.

204
00:15:20,765 --> 00:15:25,429
My whole situation is falling apart
and somehow, we're back to this agenda.

205
00:15:26,838 --> 00:15:29,033
l am not an agenda.

206
00:15:38,249 --> 00:15:39,682
You know what?

207
00:15:40,485 --> 00:15:41,474
Go home.

208
00:15:42,487 --> 00:15:43,647
l'm serious.

209
00:15:44,889 --> 00:15:46,117
Take a break.

210
00:15:49,627 --> 00:15:51,618
Well, it's what you want.

211
00:15:52,163 --> 00:15:53,187
lsn't it?

212
00:15:54,365 --> 00:15:56,299
l never said that.

213
00:15:58,736 --> 00:16:00,363
Then l guess it's me.

214
00:16:18,489 --> 00:16:19,319
No.

215
00:16:20,825 --> 00:16:24,727
Ted, tell Octonalhow much local support
we've got down here.

216
00:16:24,795 --> 00:16:26,524
l don't know what to tell you.

217
00:16:26,597 --> 00:16:28,360
We're in Houston looking for help.

218
00:16:28,432 --> 00:16:30,627
Octonal has their own way of doing things.

219
00:16:30,768 --> 00:16:33,703
l'm not the only one
who's going to fight for this.

220
00:16:33,771 --> 00:16:37,969
lf that's a threat, l'm not sure what that is.
But, you lose sight....

221
00:16:38,142 --> 00:16:41,270
No. Ted, you're breaking up.

222
00:16:41,512 --> 00:16:45,039
Don't lose track of where you stand
in the food chain around here.

223
00:16:45,116 --> 00:16:48,779
l've got people here who've burned
their bridges to come work with us.

224
00:16:48,986 --> 00:16:50,044
l can barely hear you.

225
00:16:50,288 --> 00:16:51,277
Can you hear me?

226
00:16:51,689 --> 00:16:53,486
Ted, whenever you're ready.

227
00:16:53,591 --> 00:16:55,923
What the hell am l supposed to tell
my people?

228
00:16:55,993 --> 00:17:00,054
Tell them Quad Carbon is finished.
Tell them Octonalis taking us over.

229
00:17:00,631 --> 00:17:02,861
Tell them to get their résumés out.

230
00:17:06,304 --> 00:17:09,569
l'm heading for the office.
l'll call you back on a landline.

231
00:17:40,771 --> 00:17:42,898
Beatrice, thanks for coming in on Sunday.

232
00:17:42,974 --> 00:17:46,432
Call Ted Fellner.
Tell him l'll be at the office in 20 minutes.

233
00:17:46,811 --> 00:17:50,076
l've got to take the long way around.
Right.

234
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:59,751
l don't believe this. Fuck!

235
00:18:15,206 --> 00:18:16,104
Shit!

236
00:18:18,442 --> 00:18:19,431
My God!

237
00:18:39,697 --> 00:18:43,292
No. lt's a telephone! lt's just a telephone.

238
00:18:44,735 --> 00:18:46,726
No. l'm not doing anything!

239
00:18:51,642 --> 00:18:53,667
No. l just need my briefcase.

240
00:18:55,479 --> 00:18:57,208
l'm not part of this.

241
00:19:13,564 --> 00:19:15,156
l have some really bad news.

242
00:19:15,232 --> 00:19:18,690
You ought to go inside and sit down.
lt's about Peter.

243
00:19:24,675 --> 00:19:30,307
This morning there was a roadblock
and these guys in ski masks....

244
00:19:33,484 --> 00:19:36,976
They had guns and they took him
with a bunch of other people.

245
00:19:37,188 --> 00:19:41,750
He's been kidnapped.
Do you understand what l'm saying?

246
00:19:56,107 --> 00:19:58,871
We got a call from Tecala this morning.

247
00:19:58,943 --> 00:20:00,774
You're not sending me there.

248
00:20:00,911 --> 00:20:04,210
-l think if you hear me out....
-l just got off the plane, okay?

249
00:20:04,448 --> 00:20:06,348
Terry, l need you down there.

250
00:20:07,184 --> 00:20:08,981
l'm just not good at the moment.

251
00:20:09,053 --> 00:20:12,420
l want you to consider this
your first management assignment.

252
00:20:13,124 --> 00:20:14,523
The first of many.

253
00:20:16,393 --> 00:20:19,191
We all get rattled. lt's not the first time.

254
00:20:19,663 --> 00:20:21,654
That was kind of my point.

255
00:20:28,572 --> 00:20:30,699
-Sir.
-Hey, Henry.

256
00:20:32,409 --> 00:20:34,309
l'm on my way to the airport.

257
00:20:35,045 --> 00:20:39,141
l'll call your mom, see if her and Michael
can make it up this weekend.

258
00:20:39,216 --> 00:20:40,478
l'll call her.

259
00:20:42,787 --> 00:20:45,085
What time is kickoff on Sunday? 2:00?

260
00:20:45,790 --> 00:20:46,779
Yes, sir.

261
00:20:48,425 --> 00:20:50,586
l was really looking forward to it.

262
00:20:56,901 --> 00:20:59,392
Better get back out there with your mates.

263
00:20:59,737 --> 00:21:01,034
Yes, sir.

264
00:21:41,178 --> 00:21:44,306
Can l speak now? Because this is wrong.

265
00:21:44,515 --> 00:21:46,073
This is so wrong.

266
00:21:46,317 --> 00:21:48,808
l'm here to help the people of Tecala.

267
00:21:49,253 --> 00:21:51,517
l'm here to build a dam.

268
00:21:54,758 --> 00:21:57,352
No. l don't work on the pipeline.

269
00:22:00,431 --> 00:22:02,865
l'm here to build the dam at Chimaya.

270
00:22:04,869 --> 00:22:07,030
-For the pipeline.
-Not for the pipeline.

271
00:22:07,104 --> 00:22:09,868
-Yes, for the pipeline.
-Listen to me--

272
00:22:11,208 --> 00:22:13,005
Listen to me. Just listen.

273
00:22:13,244 --> 00:22:16,008
To stop the flooding.
Can you understand that?

274
00:22:18,249 --> 00:22:20,410
Don't you hear me? Didn't you hear me?

275
00:22:20,484 --> 00:22:24,147
l don't work for the pipeline!
l'm here to help the people of Tecala.

276
00:22:25,990 --> 00:22:27,787
You are a prisoner.

277
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:38,425
Una foto, por favor.

278
00:22:43,908 --> 00:22:44,772
That's it.

279
00:22:57,154 --> 00:22:59,179
This whole box is just....

280
00:23:01,659 --> 00:23:04,822
We brought some albums with us.
l was gonna...

281
00:23:05,329 --> 00:23:09,231
...organize all this,
and l just never got it together.

282
00:23:11,335 --> 00:23:12,996
Oh God, what's that? lt's lndia?

283
00:23:13,070 --> 00:23:17,006
Alice, stop now.
We need just one good picture of his face.

284
00:23:21,178 --> 00:23:22,145
Sorry.

285
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:26,572
l'm the one who's sorry.
l don't understand my country anymore.

286
00:23:35,626 --> 00:23:37,856
No, it was completely random.

287
00:23:38,128 --> 00:23:40,255
He was out in the barrio.

288
00:23:40,731 --> 00:23:44,724
Anything can happen out there.
They steal your car, your money, whatever.

289
00:23:44,969 --> 00:23:47,335
No, we don't really know a damn thing.

290
00:23:47,504 --> 00:23:49,199
Nothing definite at all.

291
00:23:51,809 --> 00:23:53,436
Let me call you back.

292
00:23:55,312 --> 00:23:57,746
You're telling him
we don't know what happened?

293
00:23:57,815 --> 00:23:59,840
At this point, we don't know.

294
00:24:00,451 --> 00:24:02,146
He was kidnapped, Jerry.

295
00:24:02,486 --> 00:24:05,455
He was taken at gunpoint in a roadblock.

296
00:24:05,823 --> 00:24:09,054
Twenty-five people saw him drive away
in that goddamn truck.

297
00:24:09,126 --> 00:24:13,358
l don't know, maybe it's me,
but that sounds pretty fucking definitive.

298
00:24:14,298 --> 00:24:16,664
Alex, it's your sister-in-law again.

299
00:24:21,538 --> 00:24:23,301
Janis, did you get the flight?

300
00:24:23,607 --> 00:24:27,099
Welcome back, Mr. Thorne.
How long will you stay this time?

301
00:24:42,860 --> 00:24:44,851
Mr. Peter Bowman.

302
00:24:45,896 --> 00:24:47,887
Let's have a look at you, mate.

303
00:25:10,721 --> 00:25:12,052
Janis!

304
00:25:12,790 --> 00:25:14,087
Alice!

305
00:25:15,626 --> 00:25:18,789
-Go here. Sandro will get your bag.
-Okay.

306
00:25:23,133 --> 00:25:25,124
-Tickets, ma'am.
-Okay. Yeah.

307
00:25:29,039 --> 00:25:31,132
Please don't lose my luggage.

308
00:25:50,360 --> 00:25:54,387
There's a guy waiting from England.
He wants to talk to you about Peter.

309
00:25:54,598 --> 00:25:56,327
He says it's important.

310
00:25:59,236 --> 00:26:01,534
l was against this, but they insist.

311
00:26:01,605 --> 00:26:03,903
Sorry. l hope we did the right thing.

312
00:26:04,041 --> 00:26:07,067
-What's Luthan Risk lnternational?
-He's a negotiator.

313
00:26:07,444 --> 00:26:10,106
-Shall l go with you?
-No. l'll take care of it.

314
00:26:10,180 --> 00:26:11,010
Hi.

315
00:26:12,049 --> 00:26:14,882
How are you? l'm Peter's sister.
Can we help you?

316
00:26:15,886 --> 00:26:17,854
Terrence Thorne. How do you do?

317
00:26:17,921 --> 00:26:20,719
Considering the circumstances,
we're doing all right.

318
00:26:20,791 --> 00:26:22,349
How do you do, Mrs. Bowman?

319
00:26:22,426 --> 00:26:25,088
l'm with Luthan Risk.
We're an international consultancy--

320
00:26:25,162 --> 00:26:26,789
l have one. Your card.

321
00:26:28,265 --> 00:26:31,962
We're based in London. l'm with
our Security and Crisis Response Unit.

322
00:26:32,169 --> 00:26:33,659
l'm sorry for appearing like this.

323
00:26:33,737 --> 00:26:36,900
My company is the designated
K and R consultant for Quad Carbon.

324
00:26:36,974 --> 00:26:38,771
''K and R.'' What is K and R?

325
00:26:39,476 --> 00:26:40,875
Kidnap and Ransom.

326
00:26:41,545 --> 00:26:44,605
-You just flew in?
-Correct. Last night.

327
00:26:44,781 --> 00:26:46,874
Have you spoken to anyone
at Quad Carbon?

328
00:26:46,950 --> 00:26:51,182
London may have. l was just assigned.
All l've seen is an employment dossier.

329
00:26:51,421 --> 00:26:54,913
l'd like to get a proper file going.
l've some questions, and so must you.

330
00:26:54,992 --> 00:26:56,653
l'll try and explain as much as l can.

331
00:27:03,367 --> 00:27:04,664
This is a game.

332
00:27:05,202 --> 00:27:08,228
lt's a game youplay,
whether you like it or not.

333
00:27:08,672 --> 00:27:12,699
For you, it's emotional. For thepeople
holding Peter, it's a business.

334
00:27:13,043 --> 00:27:15,978
The sooner you get comfortable
and objective about that...

335
00:27:16,046 --> 00:27:17,843
...the easier this willbe.

336
00:27:19,316 --> 00:27:23,184
People take hostages all over the world.
Sometimes, it's purely terror...

337
00:27:23,420 --> 00:27:25,786
...other times it's political,
propaganda purposes.

338
00:27:25,856 --> 00:27:28,324
Down here, it's simply about money.

339
00:27:29,393 --> 00:27:30,621
So...

340
00:27:30,861 --> 00:27:33,056
...where is Peter? Where is he now?

341
00:27:33,263 --> 00:27:37,131
Probably in the mountains.
He's probably been taken by the ELT.

342
00:27:37,434 --> 00:27:38,594
Look...

343
00:27:39,603 --> 00:27:41,195
...l just got off a plane.

344
00:27:41,271 --> 00:27:44,172
Can we back up a little bit here, please?

345
00:27:44,675 --> 00:27:46,609
This ELT...

346
00:27:46,810 --> 00:27:49,938
...this group, who the hell are they?

347
00:27:50,180 --> 00:27:53,274
And how can you be so sure
they're the ones who have my brother?

348
00:27:56,820 --> 00:28:00,381
This is a land reform movement.
These people are revolutionaries.

349
00:28:01,458 --> 00:28:04,188
lnitially, there was a political agenda.

350
00:28:04,294 --> 00:28:06,023
However, what you must understand is...

351
00:28:06,096 --> 00:28:07,859
...today's version ofthe EL T...

352
00:28:07,931 --> 00:28:10,559
...is a completely different animal.
Twenty years ago...

353
00:28:10,634 --> 00:28:14,400
...they were a struggling Marxist
revolutionary group in the mountains.

354
00:28:14,471 --> 00:28:16,496
The end ofthe Cold War
changed everything.

355
00:28:16,573 --> 00:28:18,131
The money from Moscow dried up...

356
00:28:18,208 --> 00:28:20,972
...and the ELThad to finda new way
to support itself.

357
00:28:21,044 --> 00:28:24,013
So they got into kidnapping,
which has made them millions.

358
00:28:24,081 --> 00:28:27,676
Then they realized they were sitting on
an even bigger goldmine.

359
00:28:27,751 --> 00:28:31,585
Behind Colombia, Tecala is the world's
largest supplier ofcocaine.

360
00:28:31,855 --> 00:28:36,053
The ELThad the weapons andan unlimited
supply ofpoor, illiterate soldiers.

361
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:40,621
They came in hardand they came in fast,
and they took over the drug trade.

362
00:28:40,797 --> 00:28:43,027
Whatever political agenda
they started with...

363
00:28:43,100 --> 00:28:45,625
...has been completely perverted.

364
00:28:45,936 --> 00:28:48,461
Did you know that when you moved here?

365
00:28:51,275 --> 00:28:53,835
Listen. Can we get practical here,
just for a second?

366
00:28:53,910 --> 00:28:56,470
Can you just explain how this works,
step by step?

367
00:28:56,813 --> 00:29:00,374
We wait for contact,
they make a demand, we start negotiating.

368
00:29:00,917 --> 00:29:02,680
Negotiate? What's to negotiate?

369
00:29:02,753 --> 00:29:05,654
Everything. We pay too fast,
pay too much...

370
00:29:05,922 --> 00:29:08,789
...make it look too easy,
and instead of getting Peter back...

371
00:29:08,859 --> 00:29:12,488
...we'llget a message thanking us
for the down payment andasking for more.

372
00:29:12,562 --> 00:29:15,122
All that we want to do is finda number.

373
00:29:15,932 --> 00:29:19,698
A dollar figure that gets Peter back
in onepiece as quickly as possible.

374
00:29:33,250 --> 00:29:34,342
No.

375
00:29:34,685 --> 00:29:37,210
Let me clarify something.
This is not about rescues.

376
00:29:37,287 --> 00:29:39,448
This is not about bringing anyone
tojustice.

377
00:29:39,523 --> 00:29:41,514
Relying on the police down here
is dangerous.

378
00:29:41,591 --> 00:29:44,389
The army is no better.
They're pumped up and trigger-happy.

379
00:29:44,461 --> 00:29:47,953
The last thing we need is heroics,
so we rely on nobody, nobody local.

380
00:29:48,031 --> 00:29:50,898
And the embassy?
l'm still waiting for them to call me back.

381
00:29:50,967 --> 00:29:52,935
The US mission down here
at the moment...

382
00:29:53,003 --> 00:29:56,803
...is to try andbreak the ELTand switch
the country's economy from drugs...

383
00:29:56,873 --> 00:29:58,238
...topetroleum.

384
00:29:58,342 --> 00:30:00,503
Peter does not fit into thoseplans.

385
00:30:00,577 --> 00:30:03,239
The embassy cannot help you
and they know it.

386
00:30:03,747 --> 00:30:07,205
The most you'llget is a sympathetic smile
anda pat on the back.

387
00:30:07,284 --> 00:30:09,115
How long is this gonna take?

388
00:30:09,419 --> 00:30:11,046
ln truth, l don't know.

389
00:30:11,154 --> 00:30:14,954
You need to settle in for a long haul.
Nothing goes quickly in Tecala.

390
00:30:15,025 --> 00:30:18,051
But thepeople holding Peter,
they do know what they're doing.

391
00:30:18,128 --> 00:30:21,655
He's a very valuable commodity,
andit's in their best interest...

392
00:30:21,732 --> 00:30:23,495
...to keep him healthy.

393
00:30:25,502 --> 00:30:29,495
Was Peter in the habit of taking off
and not telling you where he would be?

394
00:30:30,307 --> 00:30:32,901
No. What are you getting at?

395
00:30:33,310 --> 00:30:34,743
How is his health?

396
00:30:35,078 --> 00:30:37,239
Peter's health has always been fine.

397
00:30:37,314 --> 00:30:38,679
-Medication?
-No.

398
00:30:40,751 --> 00:30:43,652
-What about allergies?
-No. Nothing.

399
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:45,881
He's allergic to chlorine and strawberries.

400
00:30:45,956 --> 00:30:48,982
A blood vessel popped in his eye.
He's been taking drops.

401
00:30:49,059 --> 00:30:51,425
And he's very prone to ear infections.

402
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:00,458
What about emotionally? ls he equipped
to handle this kind of stress?

403
00:31:01,238 --> 00:31:02,796
What kind of stress?

404
00:31:32,569 --> 00:31:37,131
l don't know, Frank. He doesn't know.
lt could be one week, it could be six.

405
00:31:37,507 --> 00:31:40,305
She's Alice. What can l tell you?
Alice is Alice.

406
00:31:40,377 --> 00:31:42,675
She's still out there,
trying to save the world.

407
00:31:42,746 --> 00:31:46,147
-l can't tell you what she's feeling.
-Who are you? l mean...

408
00:31:46,249 --> 00:31:49,616
...people who do this,
are you lawyers, foreign service, what?

409
00:31:50,020 --> 00:31:53,387
Some law enforcement, some intelligence.
Mostly, it's military.

410
00:31:53,457 --> 00:31:56,483
-Which are you?
-l was a soldier.

411
00:31:57,360 --> 00:31:58,884
What kind of soldier?

412
00:31:59,663 --> 00:32:00,891
British army.

413
00:32:01,698 --> 00:32:04,132
-You sound Australian.
-l am.

414
00:32:04,501 --> 00:32:06,332
l was in the regiment at home...

415
00:32:06,403 --> 00:32:10,032
...but we don't get into a lot of action
down there, so l went to England.

416
00:32:10,106 --> 00:32:12,336
SAS. Special Air Service.

417
00:32:12,509 --> 00:32:14,977
''Special,'' meaning what? Special Forces?

418
00:32:15,779 --> 00:32:16,837
Right.

419
00:32:22,052 --> 00:32:23,747
She is a trip.

420
00:32:25,722 --> 00:32:28,657
-Do they get on?
-With Peter? She drives him crazy.

421
00:32:29,359 --> 00:32:32,988
Sometimes l think we've been bouncing
around the world so he can avoid her.

422
00:32:33,063 --> 00:32:35,361
l read that in the employment dossier.

423
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:38,890
The ''bouncing around.''

424
00:32:40,270 --> 00:32:42,795
He shouldn't have been in that convertible.

425
00:32:43,874 --> 00:32:46,172
His stupid goddamn car.

426
00:32:47,777 --> 00:32:50,541
Tell me, what's with all the scorpions?

427
00:32:54,384 --> 00:32:56,545
This house. lt's insane, isn't it?

428
00:32:57,220 --> 00:33:01,657
Some busted drug lord, El Escorpión,
built it for one of his mistresses.

429
00:33:02,425 --> 00:33:05,826
Peter called and said he had found
this ridiculous, enormous house...

430
00:33:05,896 --> 00:33:08,990
...that nobody wanted
because it was supposed to be cursed.

431
00:33:09,266 --> 00:33:14,727
One of the maids comes every Monday
and sprinkles holy water around.

432
00:33:14,804 --> 00:33:18,103
So maybe it is cursed, all that bad juju.

433
00:33:25,315 --> 00:33:29,376
So, this is your life. This is what you do.

434
00:33:29,719 --> 00:33:32,313
Go into people's houses,
tell them how it is.

435
00:33:32,789 --> 00:33:33,881
That's part of it.

436
00:33:33,957 --> 00:33:37,222
Try to figure out what they're like,
how they'll be and hold up.

437
00:33:37,294 --> 00:33:39,455
That's what you're doing, isn't it?

438
00:33:40,363 --> 00:33:42,297
Mrs. Bowman, l'm on your side.

439
00:33:44,568 --> 00:33:46,160
So, how am l doing...

440
00:33:46,570 --> 00:33:48,595
...you know, for the bereaved spouse?

441
00:33:49,005 --> 00:33:51,530
Your husband isn't dead. He's alive.

442
00:33:52,242 --> 00:33:55,678
And l will do everything l can
to make sure he gets home safe.

443
00:33:56,246 --> 00:33:58,407
This won't work if you bullshit me.

444
00:33:59,049 --> 00:34:00,346
l can see that.

445
00:34:00,483 --> 00:34:02,280
So we'll be straight up, then?

446
00:34:02,786 --> 00:34:04,754
That's exactly how we'll do it.

447
00:34:08,625 --> 00:34:09,557
Sorry.

448
00:34:10,327 --> 00:34:13,490
God, you'd think l'd been gone for a month.

449
00:34:13,630 --> 00:34:14,494
Would you like some wine?

450
00:34:15,732 --> 00:34:17,063
You know l don't drink.

451
00:34:17,767 --> 00:34:19,166
So, where were we?

452
00:34:44,127 --> 00:34:45,992
l like this!

453
00:34:59,542 --> 00:35:00,531
He's loco.

454
00:35:01,778 --> 00:35:04,406
Don't be afraid, we're not gonna kill you.

455
00:35:28,471 --> 00:35:31,031
The competition arrives.

456
00:35:41,384 --> 00:35:42,749
Hello, mate.

457
00:35:43,553 --> 00:35:45,851
l heard an ugly rumor
you were around somewhere.

458
00:35:45,922 --> 00:35:48,982
l thought you'd gone all civilized
and unsocial on us.

459
00:35:49,325 --> 00:35:51,156
What's this? A face-lift?

460
00:35:51,461 --> 00:35:54,157
Yeah, l'm doing one side at a time.
You good?

461
00:35:54,631 --> 00:35:56,690
He looks like shit, but he's working.

462
00:35:56,766 --> 00:35:58,199
What are you celebrating?

463
00:35:58,268 --> 00:36:01,260
Life, liberty, and the ability
to purchase clitoris.

464
00:36:01,538 --> 00:36:02,505
Jesus!

465
00:36:02,739 --> 00:36:04,639
Thank God you're here, Terry.

466
00:36:05,041 --> 00:36:09,569
Because the quality of conversation
has been just ''bloody appalling.''

467
00:36:11,715 --> 00:36:12,943
Where was it?

468
00:36:13,416 --> 00:36:15,384
Someone said you were in Turkey?

469
00:36:15,452 --> 00:36:17,579
Not Turkey, Chechnya.

470
00:36:18,354 --> 00:36:21,323
-With the Frenchman, Lenoir.
-Keeping updated?

471
00:36:21,524 --> 00:36:25,688
My guys turned that one down.
lt's a job Wyatt's outfit would take.

472
00:36:26,796 --> 00:36:28,286
Thought you were retiring.

473
00:36:28,364 --> 00:36:33,495
Yes, l was,
but lnherent Risk rang me with a sob story.

474
00:36:34,604 --> 00:36:37,300
Could l, please? ''Old time's sake?''

475
00:36:38,308 --> 00:36:39,741
What are you doing?

476
00:36:40,610 --> 00:36:43,010
l'm working on the biggest thing
down here.

477
00:36:43,880 --> 00:36:45,609
He's doing the ltalian.

478
00:36:45,782 --> 00:36:47,977
Calitri. Banker.

479
00:36:48,618 --> 00:36:51,485
-Very pleased with himself.
-l can tell.

480
00:36:52,655 --> 00:36:56,022
And lan has you off
in fucking Chechnya alone.

481
00:36:56,359 --> 00:37:00,420
That's why l left. Luthan Risk doesn't give
a shit about you, and you know it.

482
00:37:01,664 --> 00:37:03,029
Your cops still on the payroll?

483
00:37:03,099 --> 00:37:06,262
-Better than ever. Judges, too.
-Will you run some names for me?

484
00:37:06,336 --> 00:37:08,600
That top one is this client's driver.

485
00:37:09,873 --> 00:37:13,240
-Shouldn't be a problem, for a hefty price.
-Will we ever get a drink?

486
00:37:13,309 --> 00:37:15,402
l think somebody's kidnapped the barman.

487
00:37:15,478 --> 00:37:17,105
That's all right, mate.

488
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:18,406
My shout.

489
00:37:19,816 --> 00:37:22,046
Bloody hell! That's just like mine.

490
00:37:22,619 --> 00:37:24,314
lt is yours.

491
00:37:24,821 --> 00:37:26,152
lt is mine.

492
00:37:28,858 --> 00:37:30,883
Hey, old mate. lt's good to see you.

493
00:37:34,164 --> 00:37:38,032
Alice, l can't tell you how shocked l am
something like this could happen.

494
00:37:38,101 --> 00:37:40,092
Did you get my wire? How are you doing?

495
00:37:40,170 --> 00:37:43,037
-Janis Goodman. Peter's sister.
-Ted Fellner. Peter's boss.

496
00:37:43,106 --> 00:37:45,700
-Nice to meet you.
-Let's step into my office.

497
00:37:45,975 --> 00:37:48,876
l was in Houston, got this phone call.
l couldn't believe it.

498
00:37:48,945 --> 00:37:51,743
l flew back here last night.
We've got everybody working...

499
00:37:51,815 --> 00:37:55,478
...trying to access the information we need
to make some informed decisions.

500
00:37:55,552 --> 00:37:58,783
Make them quick. The right decisions.
Please sit down.

501
00:37:59,389 --> 00:38:01,619
Would you like some coffee or tea?

502
00:38:01,825 --> 00:38:04,055
No, l think we're fine.

503
00:38:08,698 --> 00:38:10,165
Where's Mr. Thorne?

504
00:38:12,335 --> 00:38:14,064
The guy from Luthan Risk.

505
00:38:14,137 --> 00:38:15,365
Right.

506
00:38:16,439 --> 00:38:18,430
There's been a change in plans.

507
00:38:18,908 --> 00:38:20,466
What kind of change?

508
00:38:22,111 --> 00:38:25,274
We think it's best for all of us,
under the circumstances...

509
00:38:25,348 --> 00:38:27,407
...to go with a local representative.

510
00:38:27,483 --> 00:38:31,249
-You don't want to use Luthan Risk?
-What circumstances?

511
00:38:33,823 --> 00:38:35,347
There's no insurance.

512
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:41,592
None of us, no one at Quad Carbon,
has been insured for kidnapping since July.

513
00:38:41,998 --> 00:38:46,401
Some idiot was trying to cut costs
and didn't realize what they were doing.

514
00:38:48,104 --> 00:38:50,470
Alice, honey, please.

515
00:38:51,207 --> 00:38:53,402
This could be any one of us.

516
00:38:53,776 --> 00:38:57,405
We're doing our best. We're talking
to Octonal, trying to get their input.

517
00:38:57,480 --> 00:39:00,643
We're hoping they'll step up and cover this,
but at this point--

518
00:39:00,717 --> 00:39:02,446
Don't they have to?

519
00:39:02,518 --> 00:39:05,954
Their position is, they're buying a pipeline,
not the company.

520
00:39:06,322 --> 00:39:08,688
-lt's a bit complicated.
-Their ''position''?

521
00:39:09,092 --> 00:39:12,186
How do they already have a position?
This just happened!

522
00:39:12,395 --> 00:39:16,161
Could you just tell me
where Quad Carbon stands in all of this?

523
00:39:16,599 --> 00:39:18,396
Quad Carbon is evaporating.

524
00:39:19,435 --> 00:39:23,667
They're selling off what they can.
Just a little late for miracles.

525
00:39:27,143 --> 00:39:29,077
So you're all out of work?

526
00:39:30,013 --> 00:39:31,640
lt would seem so.

527
00:39:37,020 --> 00:39:38,282
Who's this?

528
00:39:38,454 --> 00:39:40,854
This is Arturo Fernandez.

529
00:39:41,057 --> 00:39:42,149
Señora Bowman.

530
00:39:42,225 --> 00:39:45,820
Mr. Fernandez has been
our local security coordinator for years.

531
00:39:45,929 --> 00:39:48,295
He's very well connected
and very experienced.

532
00:39:48,364 --> 00:39:51,060
lf you give us a few minutes you'll realize...

533
00:39:51,134 --> 00:39:54,035
...just how lucky we are
to have him working with us.

534
00:40:14,557 --> 00:40:16,718
Mr. Thorne, you're leaving so soon.

535
00:40:17,226 --> 00:40:19,456
Perhaps next time we can go dancing.

536
00:40:19,529 --> 00:40:21,520
Boy, did you have me fooled.

537
00:40:23,599 --> 00:40:26,397
-l was just about to call you.
-Where, from the plane?

538
00:40:27,370 --> 00:40:31,636
You stood in my house and you told me
that l didn't have to worry anymore.

539
00:40:32,475 --> 00:40:34,602
We thought Quad Carbon was still a client.

540
00:40:34,677 --> 00:40:36,736
What about us? We can't be the client?

541
00:40:36,813 --> 00:40:39,646
l really am sorry.
lt's not a good situation for us either.

542
00:40:39,716 --> 00:40:40,842
''Us''?

543
00:40:41,351 --> 00:40:42,443
You.

544
00:40:42,685 --> 00:40:47,247
You stood in my kitchen and you told me
my husband was coming home.

545
00:40:48,624 --> 00:40:50,888
Quad Carbon is out of business, okay?

546
00:40:51,127 --> 00:40:54,324
Octonal spends $40 million a year
on K and R insurance in the world.

547
00:40:54,397 --> 00:40:56,763
My company has 30 percent
of that package.

548
00:40:57,300 --> 00:41:00,565
-Octonal does not like conflict.
-Peter doesn't work for Octonal.

549
00:41:00,636 --> 00:41:04,663
That's the point and the way they want it.
No Quad Carbon confusion.

550
00:41:06,509 --> 00:41:08,477
l'm not even supposed to talk to you.

551
00:41:08,544 --> 00:41:11,741
-So, this is you being brave?
-No, this is me doing my job.

552
00:41:11,848 --> 00:41:15,784
lt's good l came by then, right?
Let you get that off your chest.

553
00:41:15,885 --> 00:41:17,580
l'm sure it'll all work out.

554
00:41:17,820 --> 00:41:20,311
You know they're giving us
some local security guy?

555
00:41:20,390 --> 00:41:22,756
Exactly the kind of guy
you warned me about.

556
00:41:22,825 --> 00:41:24,486
What can l say? l don't make policy.

557
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:27,654
Great. So when this is over
and my husband is dead...

558
00:41:27,764 --> 00:41:30,562
...and l'm suing these bastards,
you can tell the judge...

559
00:41:30,633 --> 00:41:33,500
...you did everything you could
to help me out?

560
00:41:34,871 --> 00:41:36,361
Wait a minute. Wait!

561
00:41:39,108 --> 00:41:43,044
Listen to me, l'm sorry.
l apologize. l'm sorry!

562
00:41:44,047 --> 00:41:45,878
l'm sorry to be like this...

563
00:41:46,049 --> 00:41:47,175
...but...

564
00:41:47,550 --> 00:41:48,949
...you are...

565
00:41:49,152 --> 00:41:52,349
...the first, you are the only person...

566
00:41:52,522 --> 00:41:55,753
...l've met who knows
what they're talking about.

567
00:41:56,059 --> 00:42:00,018
So, l'm begging you, l am totally
begging you to help me out on this.

568
00:42:00,229 --> 00:42:02,322
You asked me not to bullshit you, right?

569
00:42:02,732 --> 00:42:03,699
Right.

570
00:42:04,133 --> 00:42:05,760
l got a plane to catch.

571
00:43:18,207 --> 00:43:21,643
Alice, l'm sorry.
We just had a call about Peter.

572
00:43:22,011 --> 00:43:24,980
They said to look in our car
for a cell phone. This was there.

573
00:43:25,047 --> 00:43:27,447
They are calling back to this phone
in 20 minutes.

574
00:43:27,517 --> 00:43:28,677
God, Alice...

575
00:43:28,751 --> 00:43:30,548
...they have our phone number.

576
00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:31,846
My God.

577
00:43:49,038 --> 00:43:50,266
Peter is alive.

578
00:43:50,339 --> 00:43:53,638
He's definitely being held
by El Ejército de Liberación de Tecala.

579
00:43:53,709 --> 00:43:57,042
He's in good health,
but he's a prisoner of war.

580
00:43:57,180 --> 00:44:00,013
-They want $5 million for his release.
-Oh, my God.

581
00:44:00,183 --> 00:44:03,346
Obviously, this is negotiable.

582
00:44:03,553 --> 00:44:05,851
They always start with a big number.

583
00:44:06,556 --> 00:44:10,652
He says that in order to make it better
for Peter's care and food...

584
00:44:10,726 --> 00:44:14,924
...and to prove to us that he's alive,
they want to get a first transfer...

585
00:44:15,765 --> 00:44:19,599
...as a gesture of good faith.
As soon as possible.

586
00:44:20,236 --> 00:44:21,965
First transfer being what?

587
00:44:22,605 --> 00:44:24,300
1 .5 billion pesos.

588
00:44:24,373 --> 00:44:27,137
-Jesus!
-lt's only $50,000.

589
00:44:28,211 --> 00:44:29,576
Can l talk to him?

590
00:44:30,746 --> 00:44:32,338
No, l don't think so.

591
00:44:32,481 --> 00:44:35,382
This guy is going to make one last contact.

592
00:44:35,718 --> 00:44:38,243
He will let us know where to go for this.

593
00:44:43,159 --> 00:44:44,558
But, ladies...

594
00:44:44,694 --> 00:44:48,152
...the important thing is that Peter is alive.

595
00:44:48,831 --> 00:44:50,594
This is very positive.

596
00:44:50,967 --> 00:44:52,264
lt's very fast.

597
00:44:52,602 --> 00:44:55,036
A case like this? Very fast.

598
00:44:55,304 --> 00:44:57,829
-Honest.
-Could you excuse us for a minute, please?

599
00:44:57,907 --> 00:44:58,771
Sure.

600
00:44:58,841 --> 00:44:59,899
Thank you.

601
00:45:04,046 --> 00:45:08,608
l am not trusting that man with $50,000.

602
00:45:08,751 --> 00:45:12,243
-What is the alternative?
-You feel good about this? About him?

603
00:45:12,321 --> 00:45:16,121
This whole thing feels thrown together.
lt feels out of control.

604
00:45:16,192 --> 00:45:18,057
There's more than one person
who does this.

605
00:45:18,127 --> 00:45:20,322
You've been calling for two days
and nothing!

606
00:45:20,396 --> 00:45:22,626
l want to wait for the guy in Miami.

607
00:45:22,798 --> 00:45:26,996
How long, five days, two weeks? You want
to comparison-shop? Peter is alive now!

608
00:45:27,103 --> 00:45:29,765
Peter is my little brother.

609
00:45:32,942 --> 00:45:35,172
l'm trying to be smart about this.

610
00:45:35,411 --> 00:45:37,936
l've never done this before.

611
00:45:38,180 --> 00:45:39,807
l know. l'm just....

612
00:45:40,049 --> 00:45:41,311
l know.

613
00:45:42,285 --> 00:45:43,582
l know.

614
00:45:51,427 --> 00:45:52,951
Ask him where he thinks l'll go?

615
00:46:02,838 --> 00:46:04,772
Ask him how long l have to be here.

616
00:46:23,025 --> 00:46:24,390
What did he say?

617
00:46:24,827 --> 00:46:27,796
Never mind. lt's okay.

618
00:46:36,872 --> 00:46:39,739
Lord Lucan is actually living in the Ukraine.

619
00:46:41,377 --> 00:46:42,708
ln a sanatorium.

620
00:46:43,279 --> 00:46:44,837
Terry.

621
00:46:44,914 --> 00:46:47,314
-Welcome back.
-Hello, Terry.

622
00:46:50,252 --> 00:46:51,981
Pleasure seeing you again.

623
00:46:54,423 --> 00:46:57,551
Round at Westminster
and back down to Greenwich, please.

624
00:47:00,529 --> 00:47:02,520
l'll have two of these, please.

625
00:47:05,735 --> 00:47:08,203
Here's to dodging bullets.

626
00:47:14,276 --> 00:47:18,076
We almost lost a $12 million contract
over this Quad Carbon fiasco.

627
00:47:18,147 --> 00:47:20,945
Octonal got quite put off
by the whole adventure.

628
00:47:21,083 --> 00:47:22,983
l'm sure you did, as well.

629
00:47:23,886 --> 00:47:25,376
Quite right, too.

630
00:47:26,689 --> 00:47:28,987
l'll make it up to you, Terry, l will.

631
00:47:30,793 --> 00:47:32,727
So, what happens to these people?

632
00:47:32,795 --> 00:47:33,784
Who?

633
00:47:34,397 --> 00:47:36,422
The Bowmans.
What happens to them now?

634
00:47:36,499 --> 00:47:39,093
Come on. They'll find a way through.

635
00:47:39,301 --> 00:47:44,034
We've got half a dozen firms on our backs.
Believe me, somebody wants this case.

636
00:47:44,240 --> 00:47:45,605
Okay. Who?

637
00:47:45,908 --> 00:47:49,674
Name a company that doesn't have
Octonal business that you'd trust.

638
00:47:50,346 --> 00:47:52,143
Trust with your own family.

639
00:47:52,314 --> 00:47:53,804
They'll be fine!

640
00:47:59,755 --> 00:48:01,086
Look...

641
00:48:02,091 --> 00:48:04,958
...l got a trip to Bangkok.
Two or three days at the most.

642
00:48:05,027 --> 00:48:08,463
Strictly management assignment.
Wave the flag. Talk to a few people.

643
00:48:08,531 --> 00:48:12,194
After that, l thought you might want
a trip to the beach at Phuket.

644
00:49:30,746 --> 00:49:33,078
lf you're handling the twenties, it's fifty.

645
00:49:33,148 --> 00:49:37,107
-And if you're handling fifties--
-l know.

646
00:49:37,653 --> 00:49:38,813
Don't!

647
00:49:49,698 --> 00:49:51,097
Damn it!

648
00:49:52,935 --> 00:49:56,496
-Shit! This is ridiculous!
-Janis.

649
00:50:01,277 --> 00:50:04,178
-Hold on. How many did you have?
-l had 50.

650
00:50:04,346 --> 00:50:06,940
Why does everyone keep asking
how much money l have?

651
00:50:07,016 --> 00:50:08,449
Please, Mr. Fernandez.

652
00:50:08,517 --> 00:50:10,314
Come on, Janis. Calm down.

653
00:50:13,556 --> 00:50:15,023
Are you expecting someone?

654
00:50:15,090 --> 00:50:16,079
No.

655
00:50:19,161 --> 00:50:20,458
Watch out!

656
00:50:20,729 --> 00:50:22,526
This guy is so....

657
00:50:22,631 --> 00:50:24,292
Maybe it's Elio.

658
00:50:27,303 --> 00:50:31,330
-Whoever it is, out!
-Please, let me handle it.

659
00:50:44,720 --> 00:50:46,415
What are you doing here?

660
00:50:47,189 --> 00:50:48,781
l wanted to apologize.

661
00:50:49,992 --> 00:50:52,017
l thought you did that already.

662
00:50:52,494 --> 00:50:55,088
My God, it's you!

663
00:50:55,898 --> 00:50:57,866
-Hello, Janis.
-What do you want?

664
00:50:57,933 --> 00:51:00,925
l wanted to tell you l'm sorry
about the way things went.

665
00:51:01,003 --> 00:51:02,937
Great, it's just that...

666
00:51:03,172 --> 00:51:04,969
...we're in the middle of something.

667
00:51:05,040 --> 00:51:08,168
l understand your reluctance,
but l want to offer you my services.

668
00:51:08,243 --> 00:51:09,938
Haven't we done this already?

669
00:51:10,012 --> 00:51:12,879
-l thought your hands were tied.
-They were.

670
00:51:13,682 --> 00:51:15,377
What about your company?

671
00:51:17,786 --> 00:51:19,481
l'd be doing this alone.

672
00:51:23,592 --> 00:51:25,822
Señora, please!

673
00:51:34,703 --> 00:51:37,763
-What's all this?
-We're putting together a payment.

674
00:51:38,540 --> 00:51:41,737
-What kind of payment?
-For Peter. A good faith payment.

675
00:51:41,810 --> 00:51:44,540
-Good faith?
-We're getting a proof of life.

676
00:51:44,780 --> 00:51:46,771
Who put this together?

677
00:51:46,849 --> 00:51:49,545
How are you doing? l'm Terry Thorne.

678
00:51:54,390 --> 00:51:55,618
What do you have here?

679
00:51:55,691 --> 00:51:59,491
We got one, two, three guys with guns.
A shitload of money.

680
00:51:59,561 --> 00:52:01,825
Holy snapping assholes, look at this!

681
00:52:05,567 --> 00:52:07,660
Tell them to put those guns down!

682
00:52:07,970 --> 00:52:09,335
All right!

683
00:52:13,976 --> 00:52:17,571
l asked you not to come in.
Maybe these ladies don't understand.

684
00:52:17,646 --> 00:52:19,113
But you understand!

685
00:52:19,448 --> 00:52:22,815
-l get this.
-You want to talk, come back later!

686
00:52:23,952 --> 00:52:26,750
-Like when the money is gone?
-There you go.

687
00:52:28,691 --> 00:52:30,955
Okay. All right.

688
00:52:31,427 --> 00:52:33,019
That's what l'm doing.

689
00:52:33,128 --> 00:52:36,427
l do this for a living. l do this all the time.

690
00:52:36,598 --> 00:52:38,259
This is my job, you know?

691
00:52:38,333 --> 00:52:40,767
You never buy a proof of life.

692
00:52:40,836 --> 00:52:43,498
Bullshit! You don't know
what you're talking about.

693
00:52:43,572 --> 00:52:48,066
You never pack money in your client's
house unless it's a fucking emergency.

694
00:52:48,177 --> 00:52:51,442
And you don't wave guns around people
you're trying to help.

695
00:52:52,114 --> 00:52:53,604
Don't do that!

696
00:52:54,450 --> 00:52:57,544
Put your gun down
or l'll blow your head off.

697
00:52:57,619 --> 00:52:58,677
Now!

698
00:53:01,156 --> 00:53:02,145
Just calm down.

699
00:53:02,224 --> 00:53:03,213
Do it!

700
00:53:04,960 --> 00:53:06,291
There you go.

701
00:53:06,595 --> 00:53:08,756
What are you gonna do now, asshole?

702
00:53:09,732 --> 00:53:10,699
Alice.

703
00:53:11,700 --> 00:53:13,133
Ask him to leave.

704
00:53:14,269 --> 00:53:15,429
What?

705
00:53:15,604 --> 00:53:18,971
Thank them very much for their help
and ask them to leave.

706
00:53:19,241 --> 00:53:21,675
Me? You are telling me?

707
00:53:22,377 --> 00:53:23,901
You're taking the case?

708
00:53:23,979 --> 00:53:26,675
-Yes.
-Enough with this. Leave, now.

709
00:53:31,086 --> 00:53:32,747
Mr. Fernandez...

710
00:53:34,156 --> 00:53:35,748
...l'd like you to go.

711
00:53:37,326 --> 00:53:40,261
-You heard Mrs. Bowman.
-l'm not going anywhere, pal.

712
00:53:40,329 --> 00:53:42,320
You are. Now!

713
00:53:45,467 --> 00:53:47,162
Can l make a suggestion?

714
00:53:47,336 --> 00:53:49,065
Can hardly wait, can l?

715
00:53:50,539 --> 00:53:54,669
l think you should calm down,
then look over there and meet my friend.

716
00:53:58,680 --> 00:54:00,147
Arturo.

717
00:54:02,451 --> 00:54:05,682
-Down. Put the fucking thing down.
-l thought you'd gone legit.

718
00:54:05,821 --> 00:54:06,685
Dino.

719
00:54:07,089 --> 00:54:07,987
Yeah.

720
00:54:08,157 --> 00:54:09,385
Let's go.

721
00:54:09,458 --> 00:54:10,948
All right, you too. Right now!

722
00:54:16,865 --> 00:54:18,196
Okay.

723
00:54:18,467 --> 00:54:20,367
Let's get this all cleaned up.

724
00:54:48,197 --> 00:54:50,597
When are you guys
gonna put those things away?

725
00:54:50,666 --> 00:54:52,497
Have a cigarette, it might help.

726
00:54:55,137 --> 00:54:57,605
Sandro's going around again.
Eliodoro is ready now.

727
00:54:57,673 --> 00:54:59,504
We are the talk of the town.

728
00:54:59,575 --> 00:55:01,873
-ls it complimentary?
-You'd be flattered.

729
00:55:01,944 --> 00:55:04,344
-Where's Mrs. Bowman?
-Check the kitchen.

730
00:55:05,147 --> 00:55:06,739
-Hey.
-Yeah?

731
00:55:06,982 --> 00:55:08,210
That was fun?

732
00:55:08,317 --> 00:55:09,375
Yeah.

733
00:55:15,224 --> 00:55:16,657
Mrs. Bowman?

734
00:55:30,239 --> 00:55:31,331
Alice?

735
00:55:40,716 --> 00:55:43,344
Dino and Sandro
are taking the dummy bags into town.

736
00:55:43,418 --> 00:55:44,908
Make it look good.

737
00:55:45,520 --> 00:55:47,249
We'll keep the cash here.

738
00:55:48,490 --> 00:55:52,483
l need to know, was there any kind
of plan? Was there a contact schedule?

739
00:55:53,962 --> 00:55:54,986
No.

740
00:55:56,331 --> 00:55:58,629
We're just waiting for another call.

741
00:56:00,535 --> 00:56:03,470
l haven't cried since this started.
lt's just....

742
00:56:03,872 --> 00:56:05,396
Hey, it's okay.

743
00:56:05,474 --> 00:56:07,999
lt's just the tension. Finally, it just....

744
00:56:08,577 --> 00:56:09,635
lt's okay.

745
00:56:25,060 --> 00:56:26,687
Why are you doing this?

746
00:56:30,132 --> 00:56:32,498
Nobody was going to take your case.

747
00:56:33,402 --> 00:56:35,097
Nobody any good, anyway.

748
00:56:36,104 --> 00:56:37,469
l know.

749
00:56:41,143 --> 00:56:41,837
But you came back.

750
00:56:44,346 --> 00:56:46,337
We have to do this my way, right?

751
00:56:46,415 --> 00:56:48,883
We'll do it together,
but you've just got to....

752
00:56:49,217 --> 00:56:49,842
Even if it gets tough.

753
00:56:53,588 --> 00:56:55,522
You have to learn to trust me.

754
00:57:21,383 --> 00:57:23,078
-'Morning.
-How are you?

755
00:57:24,953 --> 00:57:27,319
We've been listening to this all night.

756
00:57:27,422 --> 00:57:28,821
Estúpido is right.

757
00:57:29,758 --> 00:57:31,282
So, what are you doing here?

758
00:57:31,360 --> 00:57:35,091
-Linda, you're smart, a good person.
-l have no family.

759
00:57:35,397 --> 00:57:36,989
This is not your family.

760
00:57:37,065 --> 00:57:38,464
They are my family.

761
00:57:38,533 --> 00:57:40,501
-Let me be your family.
-No.

762
00:57:42,104 --> 00:57:44,732
-They are my family.
-They're not your family.

763
00:57:45,173 --> 00:57:46,504
Linda.

764
00:57:46,641 --> 00:57:48,074
Please.

765
00:57:49,311 --> 00:57:50,778
Just help me.

766
00:57:52,547 --> 00:57:54,071
You can do it.

767
00:57:54,649 --> 00:57:55,877
Help me.

768
00:58:31,520 --> 00:58:33,647
-Who answered the phone?
-Maria.

769
00:58:33,989 --> 00:58:35,422
l was in the shower.

770
00:58:35,490 --> 00:58:38,755
-Janis stayed in case there are more calls.
-Where did they hide it?

771
00:58:38,827 --> 00:58:42,126
Look for the Jesus with the purple robe.
Under the altar cloth.

772
00:59:22,804 --> 00:59:24,601
-Did you get it?
-lt's good.

773
00:59:24,773 --> 00:59:28,800
We got radio frequencies, times to call.
We're on for Wednesdays and Sundays.

774
01:00:56,064 --> 01:00:58,828
l'd like five minutes alone with you,
without your gun.

775
01:00:58,900 --> 01:01:02,802
l'd take your whole fucking world apart
without breaking a sweat. Comprende?

776
01:01:05,006 --> 01:01:07,099
l want my shirt, l want my spoon.

777
01:01:17,152 --> 01:01:19,780
Aim that fucking thing at me
one more time....

778
01:01:20,655 --> 01:01:22,418
Show me how fucking big you are!

779
01:01:24,292 --> 01:01:26,852
l'll make you eat that goddamn rifle!

780
01:02:44,973 --> 01:02:47,464
-He wants the family.
-Tell him to forget it.

781
01:02:47,542 --> 01:02:50,067
We represent the family. Just do it.

782
01:02:50,312 --> 01:02:51,301
Do it.

783
01:02:56,484 --> 01:03:01,478
Put his wife on the radio right now,
or we forget the whole fucking thing!

784
01:03:03,024 --> 01:03:04,252
Who is this?

785
01:03:04,526 --> 01:03:09,225
l saidl want to speak with the wife.
Who is this?

786
01:03:09,531 --> 01:03:11,897
You can call me Tio. What's your name?

787
01:03:14,536 --> 01:03:15,867
Callme Marco.

788
01:03:18,006 --> 01:03:19,735
You're not making all the rules here.

789
01:03:19,808 --> 01:03:21,435
We wanna work with you.

790
01:03:21,509 --> 01:03:23,909
We want a proof of life
and we're not paying for it.

791
01:03:23,978 --> 01:03:26,776
lf there's any good faith,
it can start with that.

792
01:03:26,848 --> 01:03:28,611
Okay, Uncle Tio.

793
01:03:28,683 --> 01:03:30,583
So you are the one in charge now?

794
01:03:30,652 --> 01:03:31,277
That's right.

795
01:03:31,353 --> 01:03:32,320
Good.

796
01:03:32,387 --> 01:03:35,754
Then you willbe responsible
for the death ofPeter Bowman.

797
01:03:36,057 --> 01:03:37,490
Do you understandme?

798
01:03:37,559 --> 01:03:39,049
You are responsible!

799
01:03:40,695 --> 01:03:42,219
-He's gone?
-Yeah.

800
01:03:42,630 --> 01:03:45,690
lt's all right, just get used to it.
lt's the way it's done.

801
01:04:15,296 --> 01:04:16,661
Goddamn it.

802
01:04:32,013 --> 01:04:33,537
l've never seen you smoke.

803
01:04:33,615 --> 01:04:35,446
l smoke when l play cards.

804
01:04:36,684 --> 01:04:38,811
ls that supposed to be reassuring?

805
01:04:39,954 --> 01:04:41,512
This is how it goes.

806
01:04:41,790 --> 01:04:42,757
Okay?

807
01:04:42,824 --> 01:04:45,384
They've come to us.
We've established radio contact.

808
01:04:45,460 --> 01:04:47,121
This is all positive.

809
01:04:48,029 --> 01:04:49,519
Who do you care about?

810
01:04:49,597 --> 01:04:52,794
l told you you'd have to trust me,
and you said you could.

811
01:04:55,303 --> 01:04:57,601
Dino says you have a 13-year-old son.

812
01:04:59,574 --> 01:05:01,906
Yeah. Surprised?

813
01:05:02,310 --> 01:05:04,005
What if it was him?

814
01:05:04,279 --> 01:05:06,839
What if it was your son
up there in the mountains?

815
01:05:06,915 --> 01:05:11,045
l would find somebody that l could trust
and l would do what they told me.

816
01:05:18,860 --> 01:05:20,623
So, what's your son like?

817
01:05:22,297 --> 01:05:23,525
He's quiet.

818
01:05:24,098 --> 01:05:25,759
Smart, you know.

819
01:05:27,135 --> 01:05:28,966
Seems to make good friends.

820
01:05:29,704 --> 01:05:31,137
Good rugby player.

821
01:05:32,273 --> 01:05:34,104
You know, l see him all done up...

822
01:05:34,175 --> 01:05:37,633
...and l think, God, he's just at the end
of being a boy, and...

823
01:05:39,147 --> 01:05:40,671
...l missed it.

824
01:05:41,115 --> 01:05:43,140
Just haven't been there for him.

825
01:05:45,253 --> 01:05:46,880
You know, truthfully...

826
01:05:47,555 --> 01:05:49,580
...we really don't know each other.

827
01:05:49,657 --> 01:05:52,626
When he talks to me
it's like he's on a parade ground.

828
01:05:53,361 --> 01:05:55,386
So he's a soldier like his dad.

829
01:05:56,698 --> 01:05:59,531
No. He wants to be a pilot
and get all the girls.

830
01:06:02,003 --> 01:06:03,300
And his mother?

831
01:06:03,938 --> 01:06:05,667
Now, there's the soldier.

832
01:06:06,140 --> 01:06:07,869
l guess she'd have to be.

833
01:06:08,776 --> 01:06:12,303
Do you know how an English
general's daughter gets back at Daddy?

834
01:06:13,581 --> 01:06:15,276
She marries an Australian.

835
01:06:18,720 --> 01:06:20,210
You never remarried?

836
01:06:21,155 --> 01:06:23,988
l took up the veil, you know? This job.

837
01:06:24,058 --> 01:06:26,754
You gotta have rhythm,
you start moving, and...

838
01:06:30,098 --> 01:06:31,690
...it just takes over.

839
01:06:57,492 --> 01:06:58,481
Name.

840
01:06:58,593 --> 01:06:59,924
Peter Bowman.

841
01:07:06,568 --> 01:07:07,660
Come.

842
01:07:18,880 --> 01:07:20,404
You stay here.

843
01:07:43,271 --> 01:07:44,295
What?

844
01:07:45,840 --> 01:07:46,898
Quiet! Whisper!

845
01:07:49,067 --> 01:07:51,001
You came today from the mountains?

846
01:07:51,069 --> 01:07:52,900
l'm Kessler. Erich Kessler.

847
01:07:56,808 --> 01:07:58,332
Peter Bowman.

848
01:07:59,711 --> 01:08:02,475
You know my name? l'm a missionary.

849
01:08:03,414 --> 01:08:05,006
You know something...

850
01:08:05,083 --> 01:08:08,348
...perhaps, about my situation?
Some news?

851
01:08:10,989 --> 01:08:12,354
No, l don't know.

852
01:08:13,258 --> 01:08:15,089
Are you a hostage, too?

853
01:08:18,329 --> 01:08:19,796
There's an ltalian.

854
01:08:19,898 --> 01:08:23,095
Up the hill, at the farmhouse.
He came a week ago.

855
01:08:23,835 --> 01:08:25,234
ls he your friend?

856
01:08:27,105 --> 01:08:29,005
No, l was brought here alone.

857
01:08:30,174 --> 01:08:32,301
What kind of camp is this?

858
01:08:34,212 --> 01:08:36,407
Once it was only for drugs...

859
01:08:36,981 --> 01:08:38,881
...to make cocaine at the river.

860
01:08:39,884 --> 01:08:41,545
But now from the fighting...

861
01:08:43,154 --> 01:08:44,746
...it's all for soldiers.

862
01:08:45,657 --> 01:08:47,454
How long have you been here?

863
01:08:52,463 --> 01:08:54,294
You need soap for your feet?

864
01:08:54,532 --> 01:08:56,693
Maybe tomorrow, l can steal some.

865
01:08:58,836 --> 01:09:00,667
How long have you been here?

866
01:09:03,508 --> 01:09:04,907
Nineteen months.

867
01:09:07,078 --> 01:09:08,739
They think l'm crazy.

868
01:09:24,228 --> 01:09:25,559
Dover.

869
01:09:25,964 --> 01:09:28,091
-Terry, l'm sorry.
-This is Alice Bowman.

870
01:09:28,166 --> 01:09:30,361
Janis Goodman, Dover McLoon,
consulate officer.

871
01:09:30,435 --> 01:09:33,268
l know we scheduled to meet today,
but something's come up.

872
01:09:33,338 --> 01:09:36,830
-We've been waiting for an hour and a half.
-l know that.

873
01:09:37,108 --> 01:09:39,599
l really want to hear about your progress.

874
01:09:39,744 --> 01:09:41,644
l'm sympathetic, we all are, but...

875
01:09:41,713 --> 01:09:44,113
-...we've got a situation.
-What kind of situation?

876
01:09:44,182 --> 01:09:46,673
l really just think we have to reschedule.

877
01:09:47,352 --> 01:09:48,717
He's sympathetic.

878
01:09:49,187 --> 01:09:51,087
What the hell does that mean?

879
01:09:52,824 --> 01:09:55,384
The ELT just let off three car bombs
around the city.

880
01:09:55,460 --> 01:09:59,055
They've threatened the embassy.
lt's a mess. l gotta go issue a statement.

881
01:09:59,130 --> 01:10:01,325
-That's okay, you stay safe.
-Thanks.

882
01:10:04,869 --> 01:10:07,394
We need to clear out.
They've had a bomb threat.

883
01:10:21,419 --> 01:10:23,546
-What's happening?
-Get in the car!

884
01:10:26,124 --> 01:10:27,091
What's this?

885
01:10:27,158 --> 01:10:29,285
-ls it from them?
-Don't open that.

886
01:10:29,360 --> 01:10:31,920
-lt's from them, isn't it?
-Open it!

887
01:10:31,996 --> 01:10:34,794
Put your seat belts on,
we're going to the hotel.

888
01:10:35,566 --> 01:10:37,693
-Just open it.
-Not here.

889
01:10:39,570 --> 01:10:43,734
Okay, how about a nice big smile,
you skinny motherfucker.

890
01:10:48,880 --> 01:10:49,869
Shit!

891
01:10:52,483 --> 01:10:53,973
Close the door.

892
01:10:54,686 --> 01:10:55,846
Take a seat.

893
01:10:56,120 --> 01:10:58,452
Just open it. Please, just open it.

894
01:10:58,589 --> 01:11:00,750
Come on. ls it a proof of life or not?

895
01:11:00,825 --> 01:11:02,884
Give me a minute and take a seat.

896
01:11:16,708 --> 01:11:17,697
lt is.

897
01:11:18,509 --> 01:11:20,204
lt's a proof of life, isn't it?

898
01:11:20,278 --> 01:11:23,338
Usually, l do this by myself, okay?
Just wait a minute.

899
01:11:23,815 --> 01:11:26,409
There's things here
that they want us to see.

900
01:11:34,125 --> 01:11:36,389
You never get a pretty picture, okay?

901
01:11:45,970 --> 01:11:47,437
His feet.

902
01:11:49,240 --> 01:11:50,901
He looks terrible.

903
01:11:51,676 --> 01:11:53,735
What happened to his feet?

904
01:11:55,146 --> 01:11:56,408
You said...

905
01:11:56,781 --> 01:11:58,772
...that they knew he was valuable.

906
01:11:58,850 --> 01:12:01,148
That they would take care of him.

907
01:12:03,087 --> 01:12:04,645
What are you doing?

908
01:12:08,392 --> 01:12:11,384
This is it, right?
The one he's holding in the picture?

909
01:12:11,462 --> 01:12:14,863
-What, do you save all the papers?
-This is good news, okay?

910
01:12:14,932 --> 01:12:16,866
l mean, this is good luck.

911
01:12:16,968 --> 01:12:19,459
lt's what we've been waiting for.
We're in play.

912
01:12:19,537 --> 01:12:22,335
All we have to do now
is start talking specifics.

913
01:12:23,141 --> 01:12:24,165
Money.

914
01:12:24,776 --> 01:12:27,643
l need to know exactly how much
l've got to work with.

915
01:12:27,712 --> 01:12:31,239
You'll have to get back to Denver
and start putting this cash together.

916
01:12:31,315 --> 01:12:33,306
We're gonna shoot for $600,000.

917
01:12:33,484 --> 01:12:35,577
l'm hoping that's where we land.

918
01:13:19,564 --> 01:13:20,724
Thank you.

919
01:13:26,270 --> 01:13:28,135
Don't be a fool! Stop it!

920
01:13:29,407 --> 01:13:30,533
Calm down!

921
01:13:30,975 --> 01:13:32,499
lt's nothing!

922
01:13:33,878 --> 01:13:35,243
You see up there...

923
01:13:35,646 --> 01:13:36,943
...the farmhouse?

924
01:13:37,348 --> 01:13:39,612
That's where they've got the ltalian.

925
01:13:41,419 --> 01:13:43,683
On the other side, down the valley...

926
01:13:44,055 --> 01:13:46,023
...that is where they make cocaine.

927
01:13:49,827 --> 01:13:53,092
When you get home,
you'll want to talk about this. lt's normal.

928
01:13:53,164 --> 01:13:55,325
l know. lt's not restaurant conversation.

929
01:13:55,399 --> 01:13:58,129
lt's not for my friends,
it's not even for my kids.

930
01:13:58,202 --> 01:13:59,396
-Right.
-Right.

931
01:13:59,470 --> 01:14:02,530
Turn that scramble phone on,
test it out straight away.

932
01:14:02,607 --> 01:14:05,576
lf it doesn't work,
l'll come up with something else.

933
01:14:06,310 --> 01:14:07,777
You're doing great.

934
01:14:16,854 --> 01:14:18,253
Thank you.

935
01:14:19,257 --> 01:14:22,852
lt's not every soccer mom
who gets her own encrypted phone, right?

936
01:14:26,397 --> 01:14:27,887
lt's a lot of money.

937
01:14:28,633 --> 01:14:30,760
$600,000.

938
01:14:31,869 --> 01:14:33,496
He's not even sure.

939
01:14:33,671 --> 01:14:34,797
l know.

940
01:14:36,774 --> 01:14:40,505
l know you've got the kids,
tuition, your mortgage.

941
01:14:40,578 --> 01:14:43,206
l know all of it is impossible to ask.

942
01:14:43,915 --> 01:14:46,213
But you're our only chance.

943
01:14:47,685 --> 01:14:49,277
What if it's more?

944
01:14:51,789 --> 01:14:53,484
l don't know.

945
01:14:54,392 --> 01:14:59,420
But l swear, if it takes every day,
for the rest of my life, l will pay you back.

946
01:14:59,497 --> 01:15:00,589
l will.

947
01:15:01,766 --> 01:15:03,893
l'm sorry if l've been....

948
01:15:05,937 --> 01:15:09,839
lt's just that l'm trying to get through this,
trying to be...

949
01:15:11,509 --> 01:15:12,703
...strong.

950
01:15:15,346 --> 01:15:16,973
He's lucky to have you.

951
01:15:34,932 --> 01:15:36,297
Don't worry.

952
01:16:21,078 --> 01:16:22,773
-What's that?
-The alarm.

953
01:16:24,382 --> 01:16:25,747
When they ring the bell...

954
01:16:25,816 --> 01:16:29,013
-...the army is crossing the river on a raid.
-Where are they going?

955
01:16:29,086 --> 01:16:31,247
To protect their cocaine factories.

956
01:16:31,389 --> 01:16:32,856
lt's becoming a war.

957
01:16:59,350 --> 01:17:01,716
-What is it?
-Nothing.

958
01:17:09,627 --> 01:17:10,821
What was that?

959
01:17:10,895 --> 01:17:14,331
ELT sending a message.
lt's got nothing to do with us. Let's go.

960
01:17:14,398 --> 01:17:17,959
$3 million is theprice for Peter Bowman.

961
01:17:18,135 --> 01:17:19,932
That's a ridiculous figure.

962
01:17:20,104 --> 01:17:24,063
This is not a businessman.
He's an engineer, here to construct a dam.

963
01:17:24,175 --> 01:17:26,803
You're gonna have to come down
from $3 million.

964
01:17:26,877 --> 01:17:29,869
Like this is a game.
We are saying concrete things...

965
01:17:29,947 --> 01:17:33,576
...and you are having us
suck cock with this bullshit.

966
01:17:37,254 --> 01:17:38,653
At $400,000...

967
01:17:38,722 --> 01:17:40,246
...you're already over my limit.

968
01:17:41,358 --> 01:17:44,794
So, what you need to do
is take that offer back and see if....

969
01:17:44,895 --> 01:17:48,558
-What the hell are they bringing back?
-lt's a French helicopter.

970
01:17:51,535 --> 01:17:53,366
How would you know that?

971
01:17:56,140 --> 01:17:57,266
What the hell is that?

972
01:18:08,519 --> 01:18:12,683
l've got very goodnews for you.
l've got another $50,000 for you.

973
01:18:12,890 --> 01:18:14,915
$50,000 changes nothing!

974
01:18:15,059 --> 01:18:17,323
lmight as well walk across the camp...

975
01:18:17,394 --> 01:18:21,057
...go into his cell, andblow his brains out.

976
01:18:21,198 --> 01:18:22,358
Alice.

977
01:18:23,300 --> 01:18:24,995
He's nowhere near Peter.

978
01:18:25,469 --> 01:18:26,834
How do you know?

979
01:18:28,038 --> 01:18:31,474
That's a weather sheet from last Sunday.
When l was talking to him...

980
01:18:31,542 --> 01:18:34,943
...it was raining and when it was
thundering, l heard it on the radio.

981
01:18:35,012 --> 01:18:38,345
lt's not raining in the mountains,
and we know Peter's three days away.

982
01:18:38,415 --> 01:18:40,883
That means that this guy is in this city.

983
01:18:41,852 --> 01:18:43,752
Marco, if...

984
01:18:44,188 --> 01:18:48,090
...you are near Peter Bowman,
go and get him and put him on the radio...

985
01:18:48,292 --> 01:18:52,626
...so he can talk to his wife,
and we'll accept that as a proof of life.

986
01:18:53,230 --> 01:18:54,424
Over.

987
01:18:59,403 --> 01:19:00,995
Do you copy?

988
01:19:08,312 --> 01:19:11,509
You must understand that you're dealing
with a single family here.

989
01:19:11,749 --> 01:19:14,309
We know he works for
that oil company Octonal.

990
01:19:15,286 --> 01:19:18,414
We know that Octonalis
the biggest oil company in the world.

991
01:19:18,489 --> 01:19:19,683
Peter Bowman doesn't work for Octonal.

992
01:19:21,825 --> 01:19:24,350
Peter Bowman was here, subcontracting....

993
01:19:24,461 --> 01:19:26,793
-lt's her. Alice.
-Beautiful.

994
01:19:28,933 --> 01:19:31,834
lasked for $3 million, l come down
to two. lt's an insult.

995
01:19:31,902 --> 01:19:34,871
He's losing faith in the family,
and especially in the wife.

996
01:19:35,005 --> 01:19:36,597
This is bullshit. You know him.

997
01:19:36,674 --> 01:19:40,201
We can't be responsible
for what he may do to himself!

998
01:19:40,644 --> 01:19:44,136
l think wejustput a bullet in his head
and sell you the body.

999
01:19:52,723 --> 01:19:54,452
l couldn't listen anymore.

1000
01:19:57,561 --> 01:19:58,858
lt's all right.

1001
01:20:03,167 --> 01:20:04,293
You okay?

1002
01:20:07,137 --> 01:20:09,298
People say things happen for a reason.

1003
01:20:09,373 --> 01:20:12,001
You must get a lot of that, right?

1004
01:20:18,282 --> 01:20:20,648
l had a miscarriage eight months ago.

1005
01:20:20,985 --> 01:20:22,316
ln Africa.

1006
01:20:22,453 --> 01:20:25,354
lt wasn't anybody's fault.
lt wasn't Peter's fault.

1007
01:20:26,156 --> 01:20:28,920
Not like l didn't try to blame him, or...

1008
01:20:30,427 --> 01:20:33,225
...blame myself like l deserved it,
like there was a reason.

1009
01:20:33,297 --> 01:20:35,561
lf l could just figure it out.

1010
01:20:36,834 --> 01:20:40,895
l thought if l wasn't the one keeping
control, everything would fall apart.

1011
01:20:41,505 --> 01:20:43,837
And l thought that l could just...

1012
01:20:44,708 --> 01:20:46,437
...make it all happen.

1013
01:20:48,112 --> 01:20:51,047
The places we've been, like Thailand...

1014
01:20:52,116 --> 01:20:53,515
...Africa.

1015
01:20:56,253 --> 01:20:58,278
There's so much pain, you know.

1016
01:20:58,489 --> 01:21:01,424
You can't possibly make
any sense out of it.

1017
01:21:01,558 --> 01:21:06,495
You can't push it away, even if you're
paralyzed by it. What good are you? So...

1018
01:21:08,966 --> 01:21:10,456
...you let it go.

1019
01:21:12,336 --> 01:21:14,566
And now that you don't have control?

1020
01:21:16,140 --> 01:21:17,573
lt's like a faith.

1021
01:21:17,875 --> 01:21:19,433
Once you let go...

1022
01:21:20,277 --> 01:21:22,404
...everything becomes clear.

1023
01:21:24,315 --> 01:21:28,274
All the stupid, stupid shit
that l worried about.

1024
01:21:29,353 --> 01:21:31,150
Everything that l put her through.

1025
01:21:32,156 --> 01:21:34,886
lt's like, since the baby, l....

1026
01:21:36,427 --> 01:21:40,693
lt's like everything l learned along the way
somehow didn't apply to me, too.

1027
01:21:42,232 --> 01:21:44,700
You think l would have gotten
the message.

1028
01:21:44,902 --> 01:21:46,699
l gotta get through this.

1029
01:21:48,105 --> 01:21:48,935
l gotta get home.

1030
01:21:50,240 --> 01:21:52,708
Things don't happen for a reason.

1031
01:21:54,678 --> 01:21:56,202
They just...

1032
01:21:57,481 --> 01:21:58,846
...happen.

1033
01:22:03,587 --> 01:22:05,851
My daughter is buried in Africa.

1034
01:22:09,760 --> 01:22:11,819
Who can explain that?

1035
01:22:14,665 --> 01:22:16,189
What was her name?

1036
01:22:18,402 --> 01:22:19,596
Mali.

1037
01:22:20,738 --> 01:22:22,763
Mali Jasmine Bowman.

1038
01:22:23,574 --> 01:22:25,371
lt's a beautiful name.

1039
01:22:27,378 --> 01:22:29,437
Nobody ever asked me that.

1040
01:22:51,235 --> 01:22:52,395
Okay, Marco.

1041
01:22:53,337 --> 01:22:55,999
We've got $475,000.

1042
01:22:56,173 --> 01:22:57,970
That is not a goodnumber!

1043
01:22:58,041 --> 01:22:59,838
Marco, you've got to think about it.

1044
01:22:59,910 --> 01:23:04,040
lt is a good number. lt's the right number.
lt's the only number.

1045
01:23:11,922 --> 01:23:14,618
There is no company, no insurance.

1046
01:23:15,092 --> 01:23:16,855
All you're dealing with is the family.

1047
01:23:16,927 --> 01:23:18,360
This babble is bullshit.

1048
01:23:18,595 --> 01:23:21,587
They need to start thinking harder,
like around $2million...

1049
01:23:21,665 --> 01:23:23,860
...or they'llnever see him again.

1050
01:23:25,869 --> 01:23:29,771
We should close at $500,000.
We should look at $500,000.

1051
01:23:30,040 --> 01:23:31,530
You can forget it.

1052
01:23:33,243 --> 01:23:34,938
The family has worked very hard.

1053
01:23:35,012 --> 01:23:38,470
This is the complete net worth
and assets of this man's family.

1054
01:23:38,649 --> 01:23:40,173
lt's not possible.

1055
01:23:40,284 --> 01:23:42,411
lam trying, you understand?

1056
01:23:42,753 --> 01:23:45,017
lam working mypeople.

1057
01:23:45,088 --> 01:23:46,783
lam trying to make this happen.

1058
01:23:46,857 --> 01:23:51,521
But lneed something from you.
You give me nothing, nothing!

1059
01:23:54,731 --> 01:23:58,189
Marco, we got $600,000.

1060
01:23:59,269 --> 01:24:01,703
$600,000 changes nothing.

1061
01:24:01,772 --> 01:24:05,367
The maintenance alone for this brother
is more than you are offering.

1062
01:24:05,442 --> 01:24:07,171
lf that changes nothing...

1063
01:24:09,446 --> 01:24:13,678
...then you'll have to come up with
a number that does start to change things.

1064
01:24:16,053 --> 01:24:20,717
lfyou go to $650,000
l will take that back to mypeople.

1065
01:24:24,895 --> 01:24:27,022
You think you can get $650,000?

1066
01:24:30,367 --> 01:24:33,700
Right, Marco.
We're going to close it at $650,000.

1067
01:24:34,071 --> 01:24:39,600
Okay. l willgo to mypeople andl'll talk
to you again on Sunday night.

1068
01:25:20,250 --> 01:25:23,083
No. lt's all right. l'll be over here.

1069
01:25:31,428 --> 01:25:32,452
Peter.

1070
01:25:33,897 --> 01:25:36,263
-What are you doing?
-Be quiet!

1071
01:25:43,140 --> 01:25:45,108
-Are you crazy?
-Watch for me!

1072
01:25:47,511 --> 01:25:50,639
-What are you doing? lt's too dangerous.
-Give me your Bible.

1073
01:25:50,881 --> 01:25:53,281
-What for?
-Give me your goddamn Bible!

1074
01:25:54,985 --> 01:25:56,213
Watch.

1075
01:25:59,222 --> 01:26:00,655
lt's all right!

1076
01:26:01,191 --> 01:26:04,058
Jesus, we're right there.
And there is the pipeline.

1077
01:26:04,328 --> 01:26:05,317
Hurry up.

1078
01:26:07,230 --> 01:26:08,993
l can't believe we're so close.

1079
01:26:09,066 --> 01:26:10,590
They are coming back.

1080
01:26:12,769 --> 01:26:15,067
You're crazy. You're risking our lives.

1081
01:26:15,138 --> 01:26:16,537
Okay, almost.

1082
01:26:16,740 --> 01:26:17,900
Goddamn fool!

1083
01:26:17,975 --> 01:26:19,966
l'm going to bring it back!

1084
01:26:20,377 --> 01:26:21,776
l'll take it back.

1085
01:26:21,845 --> 01:26:24,780
No, it's too dangerous. l'll do it.

1086
01:26:37,928 --> 01:26:39,418
Look at me!

1087
01:27:05,455 --> 01:27:07,548
These pigs are lucky to have you.

1088
01:27:13,063 --> 01:27:14,826
Muy lucky.

1089
01:27:18,335 --> 01:27:21,395
That's for your main account.
The others are subsidiary accounts.

1090
01:27:21,471 --> 01:27:23,701
-l'm signing all these?
-And initial each page.

1091
01:27:23,774 --> 01:27:26,868
You have to keep
each account under $200,000.

1092
01:27:27,144 --> 01:27:30,170
Anything over that,
they put a magnifying glass on it.

1093
01:27:31,281 --> 01:27:34,614
Once the accounts are available,
it takes less than an hour...

1094
01:27:34,685 --> 01:27:37,984
...for the funds to be transferred
from your bank in Denver.

1095
01:27:41,591 --> 01:27:44,890
Dino, that third drawer down
at the bottom, there's candles.

1096
01:27:45,295 --> 01:27:48,230
Maria, can you grab me
some candle holders?

1097
01:27:48,932 --> 01:27:50,194
Sorry about that.

1098
01:27:50,267 --> 01:27:53,862
Don't apologize, one has to live
with these guerrillas, l suppose.

1099
01:27:53,937 --> 01:27:56,303
Torch it up. There. Careful.

1100
01:27:58,508 --> 01:28:00,373
We need to initial the passport numbers.

1101
01:28:00,444 --> 01:28:02,071
The host with the most.

1102
01:28:02,813 --> 01:28:04,974
Just like your last birthday party.

1103
01:28:06,450 --> 01:28:08,714
What happened at your last birthday party?

1104
01:28:08,785 --> 01:28:10,719
Terry popped out of a cake...

1105
01:28:11,054 --> 01:28:14,387
...scared the shit out of us.
lt's a K and R thing.

1106
01:28:19,963 --> 01:28:21,954
You got to get me a pair of those boots.

1107
01:28:22,032 --> 01:28:24,500
l'll never make it out of here in these.

1108
01:28:25,535 --> 01:28:27,765
-You won't make it without me.
-No!

1109
01:28:29,172 --> 01:28:32,972
l'm not going to be responsible for you.
This is my decision. For me.

1110
01:28:34,010 --> 01:28:36,604
Once l start, l'm not gonna turn back.

1111
01:28:37,047 --> 01:28:38,674
You're not responsible.

1112
01:28:39,583 --> 01:28:40,481
Erich.

1113
01:28:40,617 --> 01:28:42,778
l have to get back to my wife.

1114
01:28:43,220 --> 01:28:45,654
l have to. lf l stay here, l'll die.

1115
01:28:45,822 --> 01:28:47,221
l know it.

1116
01:28:47,390 --> 01:28:49,790
This is not your problem.

1117
01:28:51,962 --> 01:28:53,520
l'm coming with you.

1118
01:28:53,830 --> 01:28:56,094
l can't stay here alone.

1119
01:28:56,633 --> 01:28:57,827
Not now.

1120
01:28:58,635 --> 01:29:00,125
l'd go crazy.

1121
01:29:01,538 --> 01:29:03,506
Marco, it's Tio. Acknowledge?

1122
01:29:05,175 --> 01:29:08,804
Marco, it's Tio. Do you copy? Over.

1123
01:29:09,179 --> 01:29:13,047
ls this thing usual? What is this?
A ploy? What is he doing?

1124
01:29:13,517 --> 01:29:18,216
He said he'd be on the radio on Sunday.
He's taking the figure back.

1125
01:29:18,889 --> 01:29:20,720
-That's a deal.
-Where is he?

1126
01:29:21,024 --> 01:29:23,549
Marco, if for some reason
you can hear me...

1127
01:29:23,827 --> 01:29:25,852
...but l can't hear you...

1128
01:29:26,296 --> 01:29:29,231
...we have to work out some other way
of communicating.

1129
01:29:29,366 --> 01:29:30,663
Marco, do you copy?

1130
01:29:33,770 --> 01:29:36,739
Acknowledge. Marco, do you copy?

1131
01:29:36,807 --> 01:29:40,607
lt's Tio. Calling Marco, do you copy?

1132
01:29:41,945 --> 01:29:45,847
We're getting a little anxious to know
if this deal is 100 percent.

1133
01:29:46,082 --> 01:29:48,642
Ask if Peter is all right, can you?

1134
01:29:49,019 --> 01:29:52,216
We need some kind of indication
that Peter Bowman is okay.

1135
01:29:55,725 --> 01:29:56,919
Which way?

1136
01:29:57,694 --> 01:29:59,662
The river's got to be this way!

1137
01:30:02,933 --> 01:30:05,333
Get up! We gotta keep moving!

1138
01:30:26,389 --> 01:30:29,415
-Come on!
-No, you got to get out of here!

1139
01:30:29,492 --> 01:30:33,428
Take this! Get the map out of here!
lt's your only chance.

1140
01:30:33,997 --> 01:30:36,465
-Promise me you'll keep going.
-l promise.

1141
01:30:39,135 --> 01:30:40,124
Shit!

1142
01:31:00,891 --> 01:31:02,290
Where's your pigs?

1143
01:31:12,936 --> 01:31:15,097
Marco, this is Tio. Do you copy?

1144
01:32:12,162 --> 01:32:13,390
Good day.

1145
01:32:14,130 --> 01:32:15,961
You better get out of there.

1146
01:32:16,333 --> 01:32:19,200
-What's up?
-The German. Kessler.

1147
01:32:19,269 --> 01:32:20,566
That missionary fella?

1148
01:32:20,637 --> 01:32:24,334
He's out. Some farmer dumped him
at one of my precincts last night.

1149
01:32:25,542 --> 01:32:27,476
What's that got to do with me?

1150
01:32:27,877 --> 01:32:31,176
He says he was with Peter.
He says they made a run for it.

1151
01:32:31,781 --> 01:32:33,806
lt doesn't sound good, Terry.

1152
01:32:36,619 --> 01:32:39,816
For the meals, we could eat together.

1153
01:32:40,757 --> 01:32:42,554
But the food, it's nothing.

1154
01:32:42,959 --> 01:32:45,189
lt's just to keep you alive.

1155
01:32:45,395 --> 01:32:50,355
But Peter would transform this crap
into a feast. He would say:

1156
01:32:51,401 --> 01:32:54,837
''Tonight, let's see
what Alice has made for us.''

1157
01:32:56,706 --> 01:32:58,071
Alice...

1158
01:32:59,943 --> 01:33:01,934
...you were everything for him.

1159
01:33:03,680 --> 01:33:07,172
He talked about you
and your daughter, Mali...

1160
01:33:07,617 --> 01:33:09,414
...all the time.

1161
01:33:11,154 --> 01:33:13,782
He loved you both so very much.

1162
01:33:15,959 --> 01:33:17,426
You have to know--

1163
01:33:20,096 --> 01:33:21,927
l'm so sorry.

1164
01:33:23,066 --> 01:33:26,331
He didn't see him killed.
He didn't see a body. He heard a shot.

1165
01:33:26,436 --> 01:33:29,337
You gotta wake up.
You gotta get real on this.

1166
01:33:30,807 --> 01:33:34,265
You don't spend that much time
working on a deal and kill your hostage.

1167
01:33:34,344 --> 01:33:37,370
When was the last time you had contact?
A week? Two weeks?

1168
01:33:37,447 --> 01:33:40,382
l've just had nothing but 22 days of static.

1169
01:33:40,450 --> 01:33:43,886
Maybe there are no more deals to be had.
Maybe this is coming apart.

1170
01:33:43,953 --> 01:33:45,682
Maybe he's alive.

1171
01:33:45,955 --> 01:33:47,354
Maybe he is.

1172
01:33:47,424 --> 01:33:50,860
Maybe he is. But what we do know
is that my guy is still up there...

1173
01:33:50,927 --> 01:33:53,760
...and they don't know Kessler's out.
They think he's dead.

1174
01:33:53,830 --> 01:33:58,164
Kessler knows every inch of that camp,
and he's willing to help me.

1175
01:33:58,334 --> 01:34:00,029
-He's a missionary--
-He's not!

1176
01:34:00,103 --> 01:34:02,628
He is from the French Foreign Legion.

1177
01:34:03,106 --> 01:34:06,439
So what? He found God.
He's got a map in there.

1178
01:34:06,843 --> 01:34:09,334
A map that l think is real.

1179
01:34:11,347 --> 01:34:13,110
Where are you going with this?

1180
01:34:13,183 --> 01:34:14,343
Okay.

1181
01:34:15,185 --> 01:34:17,676
This has to stay quiet.

1182
01:34:18,121 --> 01:34:20,180
And she has to know that.

1183
01:34:25,995 --> 01:34:29,055
You're thinking of going in?
ls that what you're thinking?

1184
01:34:29,132 --> 01:34:31,157
Fuck thinking. That's what l'm doing.

1185
01:34:31,234 --> 01:34:35,728
l'm in there on the telephone. That's all
l can do. Tell me what else l should do.

1186
01:34:38,108 --> 01:34:40,736
Talk to me before you do anything, okay?

1187
01:34:40,977 --> 01:34:42,604
For you, l can do that.

1188
01:34:42,979 --> 01:34:44,105
For you.

1189
01:34:44,214 --> 01:34:47,513
lf you don't keep me up to speed,
l'm gonna take it personally.

1190
01:34:47,584 --> 01:34:49,677
You've been doing that a lot lately.

1191
01:34:52,755 --> 01:34:54,347
l can't hear any more of this!

1192
01:34:54,424 --> 01:34:56,984
-Wait!
-An eyewitness saw him killed.

1193
01:34:57,060 --> 01:34:59,460
Until we know for sure,
this has got to stay in play.

1194
01:34:59,529 --> 01:35:02,521
What are you doing?
Why are you doing this?

1195
01:35:03,466 --> 01:35:04,865
He didn't see a body.

1196
01:35:04,934 --> 01:35:06,902
Peter is dead!

1197
01:35:07,504 --> 01:35:09,301
Let me grieve!

1198
01:35:10,073 --> 01:35:12,303
-Why can't you do that?
-lnstinct.

1199
01:35:12,509 --> 01:35:14,739
Until l know, until l'm sure...

1200
01:35:14,911 --> 01:35:18,244
...until l've received a visual confirmation
of the body of Peter...

1201
01:35:18,314 --> 01:35:21,681
...l'm looking to retrieve my cargo
and complete my mission.

1202
01:36:11,000 --> 01:36:12,661
She's just a girl.

1203
01:36:17,207 --> 01:36:21,473
She's too young to be involved in this,
please. lt's very dangerous for her.

1204
01:38:31,307 --> 01:38:32,706
How are you doing?

1205
01:38:34,777 --> 01:38:36,506
l thought we had a deal going.

1206
01:38:36,579 --> 01:38:38,843
l haven't heard from you in two weeks.
l miss you.

1207
01:38:43,353 --> 01:38:45,253
Why don't you call me ''Tio''?

1208
01:38:46,522 --> 01:38:48,251
And l'll call you ''Marco.''

1209
01:38:52,829 --> 01:38:54,558
You've got a good game going.

1210
01:38:55,231 --> 01:38:57,597
Your wife thinks you're out
with the card buddies...

1211
01:38:57,667 --> 01:38:59,794
...they think you're off with a mistress.

1212
01:38:59,869 --> 01:39:02,702
And there you are, on the radio,
every Wednesday night...

1213
01:39:02,772 --> 01:39:04,831
...bartering human life.

1214
01:39:14,317 --> 01:39:16,444
This is a tape of my friend Marco.

1215
01:39:17,720 --> 01:39:19,312
lt's not the only one.

1216
01:39:22,158 --> 01:39:23,955
ls Peter Bowman alive?

1217
01:39:27,263 --> 01:39:29,697
ls Peter Bowman alive?

1218
01:39:31,534 --> 01:39:33,229
He tried to escape.

1219
01:39:34,103 --> 01:39:35,627
He was hurt.

1220
01:39:37,607 --> 01:39:38,574
He's alive.

1221
01:39:49,185 --> 01:39:51,278
ls he with the ltalian, Calitri?

1222
01:39:53,456 --> 01:39:55,583
How did you find me?

1223
01:39:57,226 --> 01:39:59,922
Now, l have $600,000 waiting.

1224
01:40:00,029 --> 01:40:02,224
l'll get another $50,000 off the books...

1225
01:40:02,999 --> 01:40:05,661
...between you and me, if we get this done.

1226
01:40:07,403 --> 01:40:08,961
Or l've got this tape.

1227
01:40:09,038 --> 01:40:13,338
l'll lay it on your golfing buddies and
you don't make it out of the car park alive.

1228
01:40:13,409 --> 01:40:15,934
So, let's just get this deal done, shall we?

1229
01:40:16,846 --> 01:40:18,245
lt's not the money.

1230
01:40:18,314 --> 01:40:20,145
That doesn't matter anymore.

1231
01:40:20,316 --> 01:40:22,284
lt's always the money, Fred.

1232
01:40:22,585 --> 01:40:24,485
You have $1 billion?

1233
01:40:24,554 --> 01:40:27,148
Because that's the money
we are talking about.

1234
01:40:27,890 --> 01:40:31,758
You think Octonal will buy this pipeline
without a promise from the army...

1235
01:40:31,828 --> 01:40:33,989
...to completely destroy us?

1236
01:40:34,130 --> 01:40:37,293
That pipeline goes right through
our coca fields!

1237
01:40:38,501 --> 01:40:40,162
They are buying a war.

1238
01:40:40,369 --> 01:40:43,031
Peter Bowman will never get down.

1239
01:40:43,673 --> 01:40:45,698
He knows too much.

1240
01:40:46,008 --> 01:40:47,976
We are fighting for our life.

1241
01:40:48,044 --> 01:40:51,502
Listen to me. There are no more deals.

1242
01:40:53,282 --> 01:40:55,079
Enjoy the parade, Fred.

1243
01:40:58,521 --> 01:41:01,854
This is the camp.
He said they call it Canyon Verde.

1244
01:41:02,091 --> 01:41:05,788
This is the river. This valley,
the big one below, is very active.

1245
01:41:05,862 --> 01:41:08,524
Every time the army moves through,
there's a skirmish.

1246
01:41:08,598 --> 01:41:10,725
March, May and June.

1247
01:41:10,833 --> 01:41:15,395
Kessler said that every couple of weeks,
the whole camp would run out and fight.

1248
01:41:17,173 --> 01:41:19,698
-Pipeline?
-Fifteen clicks down river.

1249
01:41:26,048 --> 01:41:28,175
Terry Thorne. Tomas Morales.

1250
01:41:28,251 --> 01:41:31,550
These guys are top. They're
my Panama crew, l trained them myself.

1251
01:41:36,592 --> 01:41:38,617
So, simply, all we have to do...

1252
01:41:39,996 --> 01:41:42,328
...is encourage the army to cross the river.

1253
01:41:42,398 --> 01:41:46,164
Right about here would be convenient.
Start a battle, drain the camp.

1254
01:41:46,569 --> 01:41:48,696
Drop into this flat area.

1255
01:41:48,871 --> 01:41:52,466
While they're fighting, we slip in
from behind, extract cargo and exit.

1256
01:41:52,542 --> 01:41:55,204
Basically, we just call the army,
schedule a battle.

1257
01:41:55,278 --> 01:41:57,803
How would Wednesday
around 3:00 be for you?

1258
01:42:00,550 --> 01:42:03,781
We don't call them, mate.
Alice will do it for us.

1259
01:42:07,757 --> 01:42:10,317
Can you get a bird? Crew plus seven?

1260
01:42:10,593 --> 01:42:12,686
Are you in love with this woman?

1261
01:42:16,232 --> 01:42:18,757
l don't know
what you're holding out hope for.

1262
01:42:18,834 --> 01:42:21,962
You'll save her husband,
she'll see the light and run off with you?

1263
01:42:22,038 --> 01:42:24,666
lt doesn't work that way. You know that.

1264
01:42:30,780 --> 01:42:34,147
l want to cash out of here.
l want my own shop.

1265
01:42:36,052 --> 01:42:37,849
lf we could pull this off....

1266
01:42:37,920 --> 01:42:40,718
This is the stuff of legends.
We could sell this.

1267
01:42:41,157 --> 01:42:44,456
Don't get me wrong.
l would love to go out of here a winner.

1268
01:42:44,860 --> 01:42:49,559
But l have been over this and over this
a thousand times, and it's fucked!

1269
01:42:55,871 --> 01:42:57,270
So we're on, then?

1270
01:42:58,207 --> 01:42:59,697
Absolutely.

1271
01:43:04,747 --> 01:43:06,772
You're gonna have to lie, Alice.

1272
01:43:07,249 --> 01:43:09,911
You got to totally bullshit this bastard.

1273
01:43:10,052 --> 01:43:13,112
We've got to get the army
to in vade ELTterritory tomorrow.

1274
01:43:13,189 --> 01:43:16,352
Peter's life depends on it.
Youjust have to walk in there...

1275
01:43:16,425 --> 01:43:19,588
...you walk right up to Fellner
and you flat-out lie.

1276
01:43:19,729 --> 01:43:22,664
Andhe's got to buy it,
or we run out ofoptions.

1277
01:43:25,267 --> 01:43:26,393
Alice...

1278
01:43:26,469 --> 01:43:27,993
...are you...

1279
01:43:28,170 --> 01:43:29,501
...okay?

1280
01:43:30,206 --> 01:43:33,403
ELT wants $1 million for Peter.
We don't have it.

1281
01:43:34,410 --> 01:43:36,002
That's a lot of money.

1282
01:43:37,413 --> 01:43:40,075
lf l gave you information
for protecting the pipeline...

1283
01:43:40,149 --> 01:43:42,709
...would Octonal step up
and do the right thing?

1284
01:43:44,687 --> 01:43:47,315
What kind of information
are we talking about?

1285
01:43:50,626 --> 01:43:53,823
Alice, stop! Alonzo, don't go away.
l'll be right back.

1286
01:43:53,996 --> 01:43:55,486
Alice, come on.

1287
01:43:55,798 --> 01:43:59,234
You think l don't wake up every morning
and think about Peter?

1288
01:43:59,435 --> 01:44:03,804
l have had a dozen meetings with
the transition team about this situation.

1289
01:44:04,040 --> 01:44:05,507
Just how wrong l think it is.

1290
01:44:05,574 --> 01:44:06,836
Fuck you, Ted.

1291
01:44:08,144 --> 01:44:09,475
Look...

1292
01:44:11,347 --> 01:44:13,781
...l'm not sure
what we're talking about here.

1293
01:44:13,849 --> 01:44:16,249
But you give me something to work with...

1294
01:44:16,719 --> 01:44:19,210
...and maybe l can push this the last mile.

1295
01:44:21,624 --> 01:44:23,990
ELT is going after the pipeline tomorrow.

1296
01:44:24,060 --> 01:44:25,391
l know where.

1297
01:44:26,862 --> 01:44:28,887
Do you step up for Peter or not?

1298
01:44:29,565 --> 01:44:32,466
l don't know what you think
you're trying to accomplish...

1299
01:44:32,535 --> 01:44:35,902
...or what you think you know,
or how stupid you think l am...

1300
01:44:36,072 --> 01:44:38,438
...but l get three military briefings a week.

1301
01:44:38,507 --> 01:44:42,739
lt's a good bet that if anyone knew
what was happening here, it would be me.

1302
01:44:43,179 --> 01:44:44,407
ls that a no?

1303
01:44:44,480 --> 01:44:46,573
How could you possibly know this?

1304
01:44:54,890 --> 01:44:56,619
And who the hell is that?

1305
01:45:01,530 --> 01:45:04,590
l'm Kessler. Erich Kessler.

1306
01:45:11,941 --> 01:45:14,569
Two phosphorous, two smoke, two HE...

1307
01:45:14,643 --> 01:45:16,372
...two flashbangs per mag.

1308
01:45:24,553 --> 01:45:25,485
G-36.

1309
01:45:26,122 --> 01:45:27,817
But it's a British kick.

1310
01:45:30,559 --> 01:45:32,493
-One day's rations.
-One day?

1311
01:45:34,730 --> 01:45:38,257
l've just come from an urgent sit-down
with our old friend Dover McLoon...

1312
01:45:38,334 --> 01:45:42,703
...at the embassy, who's freaked out today
over a rebel push up towards Rio Verde.

1313
01:45:42,772 --> 01:45:44,000
Nice going, Alice.

1314
01:45:44,073 --> 01:45:45,597
Ready to rock, Terry.

1315
01:45:45,674 --> 01:45:48,507
Kit inspection in 15 minutes.
We're on the bird in an hour.

1316
01:45:48,577 --> 01:45:50,477
You heard the man. Let's go!

1317
01:45:51,113 --> 01:45:53,638
Let's go! We've got to move right now.

1318
01:45:59,088 --> 01:46:03,115
Don't make me wait. Coming at us.
We got to prep that LZ right now!

1319
01:46:03,626 --> 01:46:05,457
l've never seen you nervous.

1320
01:46:06,962 --> 01:46:08,224
Yes, you have.

1321
01:48:02,278 --> 01:48:03,905
l make it 90 to 100.

1322
01:48:04,280 --> 01:48:06,373
And that ain't no overnight stay.

1323
01:48:11,387 --> 01:48:13,082
Kessler's map is perfect.

1324
01:48:13,155 --> 01:48:14,713
Peter is the engineer.

1325
01:48:21,196 --> 01:48:22,390
l'm impressed.

1326
01:48:22,464 --> 01:48:24,329
Fellner does have clout.

1327
01:48:25,200 --> 01:48:27,327
ln less than 24 hours, the army...

1328
01:48:27,469 --> 01:48:29,664
...has crossed the river.

1329
01:48:30,139 --> 01:48:31,470
How silly.

1330
01:48:31,540 --> 01:48:33,030
Well, my old mate...

1331
01:48:34,977 --> 01:48:36,945
...why don't you wander uptown?

1332
01:48:37,012 --> 01:48:39,037
l'll catch you on the flip side.

1333
01:49:38,407 --> 01:49:40,341
Downtown-3 is in position.

1334
01:49:41,243 --> 01:49:42,540
Copy, Downtown-3.

1335
01:49:42,611 --> 01:49:44,272
Downtown-1, stand by.

1336
01:49:44,480 --> 01:49:48,678
This is Uptown-1 . We've arrived and
taken our position by the farmhouse, over.

1337
01:49:48,751 --> 01:49:50,844
Uptown-1, this is Downtown-1 .

1338
01:49:51,387 --> 01:49:54,220
Solid visual on the wood shack.
Breakfast in bed for one.

1339
01:49:54,723 --> 01:49:56,884
Appears principal cargo is on board. Over.

1340
01:49:57,292 --> 01:49:58,418
Roger that.

1341
01:50:00,062 --> 01:50:01,962
Downtown-1, this is Uptown-1 .

1342
01:50:02,031 --> 01:50:05,228
We have breakfast for three
and delivery in progress.

1343
01:50:05,300 --> 01:50:07,996
All call signs, let's go on a final head count.

1344
01:50:08,070 --> 01:50:10,004
Wood shack, one player.

1345
01:50:10,272 --> 01:50:12,900
Red bandanna. POR, door, 6 o'clock.

1346
01:50:13,542 --> 01:50:16,443
Barracks, 3 o'clock, five players. Over.

1347
01:50:16,512 --> 01:50:20,573
Uptown-1 has a two-man detail
on the farm with a possible cargo inside...

1348
01:50:20,983 --> 01:50:21,950
...and...

1349
01:50:22,117 --> 01:50:25,280
...we have a player returning downtown
via the upper path.

1350
01:50:25,354 --> 01:50:28,790
Downtown-1, this is Downtown-3.
Parade ground, 15.

1351
01:50:29,124 --> 01:50:32,525
Copy.
That gives us 21 visuals downtown...

1352
01:50:32,661 --> 01:50:35,630
...two uptown, and one in transit.
24 confirmed.

1353
01:50:35,697 --> 01:50:37,130
Copy, that makes us ready.

1354
01:50:37,199 --> 01:50:40,134
Uptown-1 is good to go.
Standing by, Downtown.

1355
01:52:05,687 --> 01:52:07,518
Peter Bowman. Peter Bowman.

1356
01:52:08,257 --> 01:52:09,815
Alice sent me.

1357
01:52:10,092 --> 01:52:13,220
Alice, your wife, sent me.

1358
01:52:13,328 --> 01:52:16,024
She told me about Mali, your daughter.
How she died...

1359
01:52:16,098 --> 01:52:17,656
...in Africa.

1360
01:52:20,235 --> 01:52:21,566
My daughter?

1361
01:52:21,770 --> 01:52:22,896
Mali.

1362
01:52:25,140 --> 01:52:26,402
Mali.

1363
01:52:26,642 --> 01:52:28,576
Alice told me. Your wife.

1364
01:52:28,644 --> 01:52:30,043
So you would know.

1365
01:52:31,246 --> 01:52:33,237
l'm here to get you home, okay?

1366
01:52:33,749 --> 01:52:34,841
All right?

1367
01:52:35,584 --> 01:52:37,552
You're not fucking with me?

1368
01:52:37,653 --> 01:52:40,281
No, mate. l'm for real.

1369
01:52:41,390 --> 01:52:43,221
We're gonna get out of here.

1370
01:52:45,194 --> 01:52:46,286
All right?

1371
01:52:47,796 --> 01:52:48,694
Okay.

1372
01:52:53,502 --> 01:52:55,970
Downtown-2,
you've got a player at 5 o'clock.

1373
01:52:58,674 --> 01:52:59,766
What fucking player?

1374
01:53:12,321 --> 01:53:14,221
Softly, mate. Softly.

1375
01:53:26,668 --> 01:53:27,430
Fuck!

1376
01:53:32,708 --> 01:53:34,335
Downtown-1, what the fuck was that?

1377
01:53:34,977 --> 01:53:36,535
All call signs, wait out.

1378
01:53:38,947 --> 01:53:40,881
l repeat. What the fuck was that, Terry?

1379
01:53:40,949 --> 01:53:42,177
Downtown-2?

1380
01:53:43,051 --> 01:53:44,211
Downtown-2, respond!

1381
01:53:44,286 --> 01:53:46,982
This is Downtown-2. Not in position.

1382
01:53:49,691 --> 01:53:52,421
l've got a 25th confirmed. Visual.
Downtown-3, 12 o'clock.

1383
01:53:53,762 --> 01:53:55,627
Downtown-1, l got him.

1384
01:53:55,697 --> 01:53:56,789
What are we doing?

1385
01:53:57,532 --> 01:53:58,294
Stand by.

1386
01:54:02,838 --> 01:54:04,635
What are we doing here?

1387
01:54:08,543 --> 01:54:09,100
Fuck!

1388
01:54:09,344 --> 01:54:11,175
Downtown-1, what are we doing?

1389
01:54:14,549 --> 01:54:15,709
Go loud.

1390
01:54:15,917 --> 01:54:17,817
-Fuck.
-Roger that.

1391
01:54:19,688 --> 01:54:21,246
He's down. Shift, 4 o'clock.

1392
01:54:23,292 --> 01:54:24,316
Can you use one of these?

1393
01:54:34,136 --> 01:54:35,330
Cover me!

1394
01:55:02,798 --> 01:55:04,493
Safety is on! Get down.

1395
01:55:12,774 --> 01:55:14,742
-Ready, Peter?
-l'm with you.

1396
01:55:18,080 --> 01:55:19,240
Back! Back!

1397
01:55:23,452 --> 01:55:25,147
l got the player from the farmhouse.

1398
01:55:25,220 --> 01:55:26,812
l'm shiftingposition.

1399
01:55:26,988 --> 01:55:28,080
Downtown-3!

1400
01:55:28,156 --> 01:55:31,023
Give us some pressure at 9 o'clock,
on my count!

1401
01:55:31,093 --> 01:55:33,118
One! Two! Three!

1402
01:55:38,633 --> 01:55:40,294
Peter, go! Stay low.

1403
01:55:48,310 --> 01:55:49,072
Fuck!

1404
01:56:01,256 --> 01:56:02,985
-Peter!
-l'm ready.

1405
01:56:13,869 --> 01:56:14,995
Through there.

1406
01:56:38,326 --> 01:56:39,293
Clear!

1407
01:56:47,436 --> 01:56:49,233
Stay down! Stay down!

1408
01:57:12,828 --> 01:57:14,193
-Which way?
-Come on!

1409
01:57:14,262 --> 01:57:16,958
Downtown-1, this is Uptown-1 .
We are secure.

1410
01:57:17,032 --> 01:57:19,626
On the lower path, l got the cargo in tow.

1411
01:57:19,701 --> 01:57:23,102
We've got bogies up our ass.
Bring the Big Bird to LZ 3.

1412
01:57:23,171 --> 01:57:25,162
Copy, Downtown-1. Move to LZ3.

We are Blue, Option 3.

01:57:28,143 --> 01:57:30,008
Big Bird, this is Uptown-1 .

1415

We are good to go.
Proceed to LZ3. lrepeat, LZ3.

1417
01:57:51,700 --> 01:57:53,190
Safety's off, okay?

1418
01:57:53,268 --> 01:57:54,326
Okay?

1419
01:57:54,736 --> 01:57:55,964
Keep moving.

1420
01:57:59,307 --> 01:58:00,934
What are you doing?

1421
01:58:03,879 --> 01:58:06,848
Keep going down the path!
Follow the path!

1422
01:58:23,031 --> 01:58:25,192
Peter, look at me. Look at me!

01:58:25,267 --> 01:58:28,759
You gotta keep going. l know
you're in pain. You've got to keep going.

1424
01:58:28,837 --> 01:58:32,170
Don't let the fuckers catch you.
They'll kill you. Stay on this path.

1425
01:58:32,240 --> 01:58:34,572
This path leads to Alice.
This path leads home!

1426
01:58:34,643 --> 01:58:36,941
Stay in front of me. Go!

1427
01:58:48,957 --> 01:58:48,990
Terry, what the hell
is going on down there?

1428
01:58:48,990 --> 01:58:51,083
Terry, what the hell
is going on down there?

1429
01:58:51,159 --> 01:58:53,491
The Big Bird is en route.

1430
01:58:56,831 --> 01:58:58,560
lt's okay! Get the camicia up.

1431
01:59:02,437 --> 01:59:03,870
Terry, where are you?

1432
01:59:04,506 --> 01:59:06,133
Downtown-1 is traveling well.

1433
01:59:06,207 --> 01:59:08,801
We've got a visual on the bird.
We're coming in.

1434
01:59:18,820 --> 01:59:20,310
You big, beautiful bitch!

1435
01:59:21,356 --> 01:59:22,755
There she is!

1436
01:59:22,924 --> 01:59:24,323
You want to go home?

1437
01:59:25,627 --> 01:59:27,492
You're going home, baby!

1438
01:59:50,752 --> 01:59:51,878
Uptown-1.

1439
01:59:51,953 --> 01:59:53,477
This is Downtown-2.

1440
01:59:53,555 --> 01:59:56,183
l have a man down. Downtown-3 is down!

1441
01:59:56,858 --> 01:59:57,688
Say again?

1442
01:59:57,759 --> 01:59:59,852
lrepeat, Downtown-3 is down.

1443
02:00:00,662 --> 02:00:01,560
Fuck!

1444
02:00:01,730 --> 02:00:03,493
Give me that fucking thing!

1445
02:00:03,965 --> 02:00:04,795
Go!

1446
02:00:05,533 --> 02:00:06,431
Five!

1447
02:00:10,739 --> 02:00:12,297
Downtown-2...

1448
02:00:12,474 --> 02:00:13,736
...l'm on my way.

1449
02:00:16,711 --> 02:00:18,508
Downtown-1, this is Uptown-1.

1450
02:00:18,580 --> 02:00:20,946
l've got a man down.
Downtown-3 is down.

1451
02:00:21,216 --> 02:00:24,913
l'm going back to get him.
Uptown-2has my cargo on the bird.

1452
02:00:24,986 --> 02:00:27,819
We 'llbe evacuating Downtown-3

1454
02:00:31,526 --> 02:00:33,494
Roger that. l'm at the LZ.

1455
02:00:33,561 --> 02:00:35,825
Got an eye on the bird, my cargo is in tow.

1456
02:00:35,897 --> 02:00:37,489
My back door is clear.

1457
02:00:37,966 --> 02:00:39,524
lf you need help, give me a yell.

1458
02:00:43,004 --> 02:00:44,562
Look out, grenade!

1459
02:00:57,819 --> 02:00:59,081
Juaco!

1460
02:01:14,969 --> 02:01:16,095

l got you. Just hang on to me.

1465
02:01:24,312 --> 02:01:26,712
Are you crazy?
Get on that fucking chopper now!

1466
02:01:32,120 --> 02:01:34,384
Eyewash! Give me some eyewash!

1467
02:01:40,562 --> 02:01:42,393
He needs something for his eyes.

1468
02:01:43,898 --> 02:01:45,229
He needs it now.

1469
02:01:46,201 --> 02:01:47,498
He's alive!

1470
02:01:48,536 --> 02:01:50,003
lt's right here.

1471
02:01:52,240 --> 02:01:54,834
Carlos, look at me. Who am l?

1472
02:01:54,909 --> 02:01:57,377
-You're an asshole.
-That's fucking right!

1473
02:02:03,218 --> 02:02:04,776
Are you all right?

1474
02:02:05,220 --> 02:02:08,621
Don't you fucking die on me, man!
l can't tell on you....

1475
02:02:08,690 --> 02:02:10,385
He always does this shit!

1476
02:02:10,458 --> 02:02:13,086
You're a pussy! He's a fucking pussy, man!

1477
02:02:23,872 --> 02:02:25,362
How is it?

1478
02:02:30,812 --> 02:02:32,143
Who are you?

1479
02:02:33,548 --> 02:02:34,947
Terry Thorne.

1480
02:02:36,985 --> 02:02:38,418
How's my wife?

1481
02:02:38,953 --> 02:02:40,147
She okay?

1482
02:02:40,922 --> 02:02:44,449
She misses you.
She's waiting for you where we land.

1483
02:03:26,601 --> 02:03:28,000
Welcome home!

1484
02:03:30,338 --> 02:03:31,999
Keep your head down.

1485
02:03:43,952 --> 02:03:45,351
Hello, Alice.

1486
02:03:50,625 --> 02:03:52,024
You all right?

1487
02:04:26,127 --> 02:04:27,287
Sandro!

1488
02:04:37,705 --> 02:04:39,070
-Hi.
-Hi.

1489
02:04:39,140 --> 02:04:40,607
You look great.

1490
02:04:56,524 --> 02:04:58,082
l need one minute.

1491
02:05:00,628 --> 02:05:01,686
Okay.

1492
02:05:15,576 --> 02:05:17,976
-We did it.
-You did it.

1493
02:05:18,680 --> 02:05:20,773
You know, you better get going.

1494
02:05:20,949 --> 02:05:23,247
We could be very unpopular
around here in the future.

1495
02:05:23,318 --> 02:05:25,047
-l thought we'd get a chance--
-What?

1496
02:05:25,119 --> 02:05:27,587
To sit around and chat? The three of us?

1497
02:05:27,822 --> 02:05:30,916
There's a 6:00 American flight to Dallas.
You can make it.

1498
02:05:30,992 --> 02:05:32,960
There's a passport in the Jeep for Peter.

1499
02:05:33,027 --> 02:05:35,427
Norma will pack the house.
She'll send everything up.

1500
02:05:35,496 --> 02:05:38,226
His leg looks bad but it can wait till Dallas.

1501
02:05:38,299 --> 02:05:39,698
This is important.

1502
02:05:40,401 --> 02:05:41,959
No telephone calls...

1503
02:05:42,036 --> 02:05:45,836
...no high-fives, no champagne.
You get to the airport...

1504
02:05:45,907 --> 02:05:47,875
...and you make that plane.

1505
02:05:48,810 --> 02:05:51,438
Just tell me
you know how much you mean to me.

1506
02:05:54,382 --> 02:05:55,644
So we're even.

1507
02:05:57,552 --> 02:05:59,247
No, we'll never be even.

1508
02:06:00,955 --> 02:06:02,479
l've given you...

1509
02:06:02,957 --> 02:06:05,425
-...nothing.
-Believe me, we're even.

1510
02:06:07,595 --> 02:06:09,563
You deserve more than this.

1511
02:06:10,031 --> 02:06:11,931
You got a plane to catch.

1512
02:06:14,068 --> 02:06:16,332
l'll see you around, Mrs. Bowman.

1513
02:07:04,385 --> 02:07:06,751
Get my Duke Ellington records.
Get me the Scotch.

1514
02:07:06,821 --> 02:07:10,882
The good shit. Twelve-year-old, not crap.
Remember the encrypted phone.

1515
02:07:11,159 --> 02:07:12,683
Take care, Alice.

1516
02:07:15,129 --> 02:07:17,154
Who's the man?

1517
02:07:17,231 --> 02:07:19,995
Stuff of legends. You are the man.

1518
02:07:20,068 --> 02:07:23,128
Sandro,
we've got to get to the airport fast.

1519
02:07:23,237 --> 02:07:25,171
We've got a flight in an hour.

1520
02:07:36,050 --> 02:07:37,347
We made it.

1521
02:07:42,423 --> 02:07:43,481
Yeah.

1522
02:07:44,158 --> 02:07:45,591
Let's go home.

1523
02:07:50,398 --> 02:07:53,526
You and me, we open our own shop.
l run New York, you run London.

1524
02:07:53,601 --> 02:07:57,264
We meet in the Caymans once a month
to visit our money.

1525
02:07:58,473 --> 02:08:00,771
Strictly white glove. Lots of long lunches.

1526
02:08:00,842 --> 02:08:03,970
No more fucking frontlines.
Some consulting, some policies...

1527
02:08:04,045 --> 02:08:07,606
...and we give lan a heart attack
before we open the doors.

1528
02:08:12,520 --> 02:08:15,284
l don't know if l want you
visiting my money.
