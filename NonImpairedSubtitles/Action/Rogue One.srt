- State your name for the record.
- Jyn Erso.

2
00:00:15,350 --> 00:00:16,550
Forgery of Imperial documents.

Possession of stolen property,
aggravated assault.

4

Resisting arrest.

5
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:27,650
On your own from the age of fifteen.
Reckless, aggressive, undisciplined...

6
00:00:27,850 --> 00:00:30,650
This is a rebellion, isn't it?

7
00:00:33,650 --> 00:00:34,850
I rebel.

8
00:00:41,150 --> 00:00:43,050
We have a mission for you.

A major weapons test is imminent.

We need to know what it is,
and how to destroy it.

11
00:00:52,650 --> 00:00:54,650
Is that clear?

12
00:00:55,250 --> 00:00:57,050
Yes, sir.

13
00:01:08,650 --> 00:01:11,650
What will you do when they catch you?

14
00:01:13,250 --> 00:01:15,350
What will you if they break you?

15
00:01:19,250 --> 00:01:21,350
If you continue to fight...

16
00:01:27,250 --> 00:01:30,050
..what will <i>you</i> become?
