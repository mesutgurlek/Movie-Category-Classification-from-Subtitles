1
00:00:19,619 --> 00:00:22,088
God said to Abraham,
"Kill me a son."

2
00:00:22,088 --> 00:00:24,079
God said to Abraham,
"Kill me a son."

3
00:00:24,157 --> 00:00:28,594
Abe says, "Man,
you must be putting me on."

4
00:00:28,661 --> 00:00:30,094
God say, "No."

5
00:00:30,163 --> 00:00:31,596
Abe say, "What?"

6
00:00:31,664 --> 00:00:34,963
God say, "You can do
what you want, Abe,

7
00:00:35,034 --> 00:00:40,131
but the next time you see me
coming, you better run."

8
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:45,405
Abe says, "Where do you want
this killing done?"

9
00:00:45,478 --> 00:00:49,437
and God says,
"Out on Highway 61."

10
00:01:22,015 --> 00:01:25,542
The Serbs have taken over
this... Albanian village.

11
00:01:25,618 --> 00:01:27,552
They're killing everyone
in sight.

12
00:01:27,620 --> 00:01:30,521
It's not a war,
it's a slaughter.

13
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:32,581
The Serbian commander is
in that mosque.

14
00:01:32,659 --> 00:01:37,028
This is the third village
in a week he's destroyed.

15
00:01:37,096 --> 00:01:39,826
We are to identify
and neutralize him.

16
00:01:39,932 --> 00:01:41,365
We will proceed under cover

17
00:01:41,434 --> 00:01:44,892
of NATO air strike,
commencing...

18
00:01:46,739 --> 00:01:49,401
right... about... now!

19
00:01:49,509 --> 00:01:50,476
Move!

20
00:04:41,447 --> 00:04:43,779
I'm in the nest.

21
00:04:43,850 --> 00:04:44,839
Copy that.

22
00:04:44,917 --> 00:04:47,112
Raven is in the nest.

23
00:04:49,956 --> 00:04:52,151
Cover fire, on my mark.

24
00:04:52,225 --> 00:04:54,216
Three...

25
00:04:54,293 --> 00:04:55,760
Two...

26
00:04:55,828 --> 00:04:57,386
One!

27
00:07:32,284 --> 00:07:34,844
Sergeant First Class
Aaron Hallam.

28
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:36,046
Yes, sir.

29
00:07:36,122 --> 00:07:39,785
It is my privilege to present
to you the Silver Star,

30
00:07:39,859 --> 00:07:42,384
one of our nation's
highest awards for valor.

31
00:07:42,461 --> 00:07:44,429
Your bravery, sound judgment,

32
00:07:44,497 --> 00:07:47,227
and outstanding resolve
are an example to all soldiers.

33
00:07:47,299 --> 00:07:49,529
Your courageous actions
are the bedrock

34
00:07:49,602 --> 00:07:51,229
upon which peace
and democracy

35
00:07:51,303 --> 00:07:52,861
have always been built.

36
00:07:55,207 --> 00:07:56,606
Congratulations, Hallam.

37
00:10:15,281 --> 00:10:16,680
Hey.

38
00:10:17,716 --> 00:10:18,774
What happened to you?

39
00:10:23,856 --> 00:10:27,121
You stepped on a snare,
didn't you?

40
00:10:51,517 --> 00:10:52,882
Easy.

41
00:10:55,421 --> 00:10:56,786
Take it easy.

42
00:10:58,324 --> 00:11:00,485
Be still.

43
00:11:00,559 --> 00:11:02,117
Be still.

44
00:11:03,863 --> 00:11:06,661
All right,
let me have that.

45
00:11:06,732 --> 00:11:08,927
Nasty thing.

46
00:11:09,001 --> 00:11:10,332
All right.

47
00:11:11,470 --> 00:11:14,030
Next time you see one of these,

48
00:11:14,139 --> 00:11:15,697
you go the other way.

49
00:11:20,846 --> 00:11:24,304
Okay...

50
00:11:24,383 --> 00:11:25,680
Here we go.

51
00:11:26,919 --> 00:11:29,080
You're good, you're good.

52
00:11:29,154 --> 00:11:30,314
All right...

53
00:11:30,389 --> 00:11:31,879
Okay.

54
00:11:33,225 --> 00:11:34,624
Now get out of here.

55
00:11:52,444 --> 00:11:54,503
Anybody here
With the initials J.W.?

56
00:11:54,580 --> 00:11:56,241
Yeah.

57
00:11:56,315 --> 00:11:57,339
This yours?

58
00:11:57,416 --> 00:11:58,405
Yeah, it is.

59
00:11:58,550 --> 00:12:00,916
What the...?!

60
00:12:00,986 --> 00:12:02,783
No more snares
on wolves, guys.

61
00:12:43,629 --> 00:12:45,392
I got him.

62
00:12:56,742 --> 00:12:58,175
He was down there.

63
00:12:58,243 --> 00:12:59,175
What?

64
00:12:59,244 --> 00:13:01,109
I saw him.

65
00:13:48,594 --> 00:13:51,324
You need all that equipment
to kill a deer?

66
00:13:53,532 --> 00:13:58,367
That's how we make sure
they're dead.

67
00:13:58,537 --> 00:14:01,335
You guys don't look
like deer hunters.

68
00:14:06,245 --> 00:14:09,180
When you kill with
your own hands,

69
00:14:09,248 --> 00:14:10,840
there is a reverence.

70
00:14:10,916 --> 00:14:15,785
Is that right?

71
00:14:15,854 --> 00:14:18,288
There is no reverence
in what you do.

72
00:14:20,559 --> 00:14:23,426
Where's your weapon?

73
00:14:30,569 --> 00:14:32,696
Holy sh...

74
00:15:05,337 --> 00:15:07,669
You're not here for
the deer, are you?

75
00:15:07,773 --> 00:15:10,537
What's that?

76
00:15:10,609 --> 00:15:15,069
You think you can hunt
me with those rifles?

77
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:17,944
Your rifles
against my knife.

78
00:15:18,016 --> 00:15:21,247
What, are you nuts?

79
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:23,220
What do you think?

80
00:15:23,288 --> 00:15:25,756
Yeah, well,
don't push it, asshole.

81
00:15:31,730 --> 00:15:33,994
Where the fuck are you?

82
00:15:34,099 --> 00:15:34,997
Come on, baby.

83
00:17:04,223 --> 00:17:06,783
Oh, God!

84
00:18:14,326 --> 00:18:16,521
You want a little
antifreeze with that?

85
00:18:16,595 --> 00:18:18,460
It's not that cold out.

86
00:18:18,530 --> 00:18:20,054
Maybe not to you.

87
00:18:21,466 --> 00:18:24,026
Thought you were on the wagon.

88
00:18:24,136 --> 00:18:25,865
Wheels fell off.

89
00:18:29,441 --> 00:18:30,738
You running a fever?

90
00:18:30,809 --> 00:18:32,674
No. I'm tired
of the goddamn cold.

91
00:18:32,744 --> 00:18:34,575
Not too crazy
about the thaw, neither.

92
00:18:34,646 --> 00:18:36,273
Well, get a
hot water bottle.

93
00:18:36,381 --> 00:18:38,246
Keep you company at night.

94
00:18:38,317 --> 00:18:39,614
I don't want
a hot water bottle.

95
00:18:39,685 --> 00:18:41,710
I want to go down to California
for a few weeks,

96
00:18:41,787 --> 00:18:43,379
catch some thoroughbreds
at Del Mar,

97
00:18:43,455 --> 00:18:44,717
do a little fishing.

98
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:45,916
They say the yellowtail jump

99
00:18:45,991 --> 00:18:47,549
right into the boat
this time of year.

100
00:18:47,626 --> 00:18:50,288
Sam, the yellowtail's not
running this time of year.

101
00:18:50,395 --> 00:18:52,955
Hello, Ted.

102
00:18:53,031 --> 00:18:55,591
L.T.

103
00:18:55,701 --> 00:18:56,861
How'd you know it was me?

104
00:18:56,968 --> 00:18:58,731
I saw your pigeon-toed tracks.

105
00:18:58,804 --> 00:19:01,295
What are you doing
this far north?

106
00:19:01,406 --> 00:19:05,433
Van Zandt wanted me
to show you something...

107
00:19:05,544 --> 00:19:07,341
personally.

108
00:19:12,184 --> 00:19:13,378
It's been a few years.

109
00:19:13,452 --> 00:19:15,215
Okachobi, 1 996.

110
00:19:15,287 --> 00:19:17,585
Yeah, your agents got so scared
of alligators down there.

111
00:19:17,656 --> 00:19:19,214
Remember that one guy
shit in his pants?

112
00:19:19,291 --> 00:19:21,225
Mike Haney.
Yeah, that was funny.

113
00:19:21,326 --> 00:19:22,816
You sort of disappeared
after that.

114
00:19:22,894 --> 00:19:24,623
Yeah, I worked a few more,
and then I quit.

115
00:19:24,696 --> 00:19:26,425
Been in Portland
for three years now.

116
00:19:26,498 --> 00:19:28,523
We've reached out
for you a few times.

117
00:19:30,535 --> 00:19:31,763
L.T., let me
ask you something.

118
00:19:31,870 --> 00:19:32,996
Yeah.

119
00:19:33,105 --> 00:19:35,471
What the hell are
you doing out here?

120
00:19:35,540 --> 00:19:37,474
Working for
the wildlife Fund.

121
00:19:43,014 --> 00:19:45,107
You went to a lot of trouble
to get yourself up here.

122
00:19:45,183 --> 00:19:46,707
You know, you're
a hard man to find.

123
00:19:46,785 --> 00:19:47,979
No, I'm not.

124
00:19:48,053 --> 00:19:50,681
How hard am I to find
if you found me?

125
00:19:50,756 --> 00:19:52,553
Van Zandt
thinks it's important.

126
00:19:52,624 --> 00:19:54,387
He thinks
everything's important.

127
00:19:54,459 --> 00:19:56,689
This one's different.

128
00:19:59,498 --> 00:20:01,932
I don't do that kind
of work anymore.

129
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,992
Why don't you
have a look?

130
00:20:05,070 --> 00:20:07,300
I really don't want
to go back there.

131
00:20:07,439 --> 00:20:11,432
All we're asking you to do
is take a look, L.T.

132
00:21:09,801 --> 00:21:12,099
Hey, Tom, can we get
prints off that paper?

133
00:21:12,170 --> 00:21:13,159
Yeah, we sure can.

134
00:21:13,271 --> 00:21:14,568
Please do, and
the door handles.

135
00:21:14,639 --> 00:21:16,300
Harry, I understand that,
but I'm concerned

136
00:21:16,441 --> 00:21:17,874
about the number
of SWAT agents.

137
00:21:17,943 --> 00:21:19,774
I want to take
these guys alive.

138
00:21:19,845 --> 00:21:21,540
Reed, we need to deploy
some of your men

139
00:21:21,613 --> 00:21:22,978
on the other side
of the canyon.

140
00:21:23,048 --> 00:21:24,606
I want to contain this area

141
00:21:24,683 --> 00:21:26,014
and establish a perimeter.

142
00:21:26,084 --> 00:21:28,382
That's your call, Abby.
We're here to help.

143
00:21:57,115 --> 00:21:58,241
Bonham, are you all right?

144
00:21:58,316 --> 00:21:59,408
No!

145
00:21:59,484 --> 00:22:02,419
I hate those things.
I'm afraid of heights.

146
00:22:02,487 --> 00:22:04,512
I'm Abby Durrell.
I'm the ASAC here.

147
00:22:04,589 --> 00:22:07,558
I'm not sure how much
Harry told you, but...

148
00:22:07,626 --> 00:22:09,856
Tell me what he told you
to tell me.

149
00:22:09,928 --> 00:22:11,759
We'll take it
from there, okay?

150
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:13,798
Okay.

151
00:22:16,001 --> 00:22:18,299
The two men were found
half a mile from here.

152
00:22:18,470 --> 00:22:19,801
They were killed
with a hatchet,

153
00:22:19,871 --> 00:22:22,772
then gutted in what looks like
a ritualistic fashion.

154
00:22:22,841 --> 00:22:25,139
Every vital organ was cut.

155
00:22:25,210 --> 00:22:27,678
I got a deputy talking
to the local Paiute chief.

156
00:22:27,746 --> 00:22:31,341
There's no Paiute ritual
for gutting a human body.

157
00:22:31,483 --> 00:22:33,348
The dead men were both
dressed and quartered

158
00:22:33,418 --> 00:22:35,045
the way you'd quarter a deer.

159
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:36,485
Paiute are upset about...

160
00:22:36,555 --> 00:22:38,022
Paiute wouldn't dress
and quarter

161
00:22:38,089 --> 00:22:39,647
a couple of deer hunters
unless...

162
00:22:39,724 --> 00:22:40,884
What?

163
00:22:40,959 --> 00:22:42,756
He was going to eat 'em.

164
00:22:44,529 --> 00:22:47,794
There were two men
killed the same way

165
00:22:47,866 --> 00:22:49,925
last week in Washington State.

166
00:22:50,035 --> 00:22:51,525
They were Forest
Service Rangers,

167
00:22:51,636 --> 00:22:54,366
Which was how
we got jurisdiction.

168
00:22:54,506 --> 00:22:55,734
Where are the bodies?

169
00:22:55,807 --> 00:22:58,037
We sent them to the lab
yesterday.

170
00:22:58,109 --> 00:23:00,202
You need to see them?

171
00:23:00,245 --> 00:23:01,177
No.

172
00:23:16,528 --> 00:23:18,393
You've got too many men
and horses in here.

173
00:23:18,463 --> 00:23:21,296
All these tracks,
this is, uh... chaos.

174
00:23:21,399 --> 00:23:24,960
Do they have a deer stand
or any coolers for packing meat?

175
00:23:25,070 --> 00:23:26,298
Not within a five-mile radius.

176
00:23:26,404 --> 00:23:27,302
Nothing.

177
00:23:27,405 --> 00:23:28,337
You have a campsite?

178
00:23:28,406 --> 00:23:29,873
Still looking.

179
00:23:31,443 --> 00:23:34,344
What do you know
about the victims?

180
00:23:34,412 --> 00:23:38,348
As far as we know, just a couple
of businessmen from Medford.

181
00:23:48,226 --> 00:23:49,557
What else can we do for you?

182
00:23:49,628 --> 00:23:51,220
Nothing.

183
00:23:51,296 --> 00:23:52,786
Ask everybody to fall back.

184
00:23:52,864 --> 00:23:55,662
Bobby, let's get everybody
out of here.

185
00:23:55,734 --> 00:23:58,225
You guys, everybody, let's go,
let's fall back. Come on.

186
00:23:58,336 --> 00:24:00,236
Let's go!

187
00:24:03,241 --> 00:24:05,106
Yeah, everyone!

188
00:26:26,351 --> 00:26:27,283
This is him.

189
00:26:27,352 --> 00:26:28,284
Who?

190
00:26:28,353 --> 00:26:29,479
The guy that did it.

191
00:26:29,554 --> 00:26:31,044
At this point, we're not sure

192
00:26:31,122 --> 00:26:32,612
how many killers there were.

193
00:26:32,690 --> 00:26:33,622
Just one.

194
00:26:33,691 --> 00:26:34,623
How do you know that?

195
00:26:34,692 --> 00:26:35,624
He left a signature

196
00:26:35,693 --> 00:26:36,682
right there in that tree.

197
00:26:36,761 --> 00:26:39,195
Mr. Bonham, the deceased
were two able-bodied men.

198
00:26:39,264 --> 00:26:40,196
-Mm-hmm.
-They had rifles

199
00:26:40,298 --> 00:26:41,458
With sophisticated
scopes on them.

200
00:26:41,533 --> 00:26:43,057
One of them had
a nine millimeter handgun

201
00:26:43,168 --> 00:26:44,100
stuck inside his jacket.

202
00:26:44,169 --> 00:26:45,101
Yeah.

203
00:26:45,170 --> 00:26:46,398
Now, it seems
unlikely that one man

204
00:26:46,504 --> 00:26:47,698
With a hatchet could possibly...

205
00:26:47,772 --> 00:26:48,704
He didn't use a hatchet.

206
00:26:48,773 --> 00:26:50,741
He used a knife
With a serrated edge on one side

207
00:26:50,809 --> 00:26:52,071
and a filet blade on the other.

208
00:26:52,143 --> 00:26:53,610
You're saying
that one guy with a knife

209
00:26:53,678 --> 00:26:55,908
threw it at this tree and then
killed those two hunters?

210
00:26:55,980 --> 00:26:58,710
Yeah. He wore a size ten shoe
with no tread,

211
00:26:58,783 --> 00:27:00,216
almost like a slipper--

212
00:27:00,251 --> 00:27:01,548
kind of like this one.

213
00:27:01,619 --> 00:27:06,215
He's out there.

214
00:27:06,291 --> 00:27:08,225
Oh, you're not going
out there alone.

215
00:27:08,293 --> 00:27:09,225
That's the way I work.

216
00:27:09,294 --> 00:27:10,352
Take this.

217
00:27:10,428 --> 00:27:11,554
I don't need that.

218
00:27:11,629 --> 00:27:12,561
Humor me.

219
00:27:12,630 --> 00:27:13,995
The battery's fully charged,

220
00:27:14,065 --> 00:27:15,896
so please make sure
you leave it on.

221
00:27:15,967 --> 00:27:17,093
Okay.

222
00:27:17,168 --> 00:27:18,226
You don't have a gun?

223
00:27:18,336 --> 00:27:19,667
I don't like guns.

224
00:27:19,771 --> 00:27:21,329
Well, how much time
do we give you?

225
00:27:21,439 --> 00:27:22,770
If I'm not back in two days,

226
00:27:22,841 --> 00:27:24,468
it'll mean I'm dead.

227
00:29:20,525 --> 00:29:21,924
L.T.

228
00:29:25,964 --> 00:29:27,090
Remember me?

229
00:29:27,165 --> 00:29:28,325
No.

230
00:29:31,269 --> 00:29:32,668
You taught me.

231
00:29:32,770 --> 00:29:33,737
I taught a lot of people.

232
00:29:42,347 --> 00:29:43,780
How come you didn't
answer my letters?

233
00:29:49,687 --> 00:29:52,622
How come you're chopping up
all these people?

234
00:29:52,690 --> 00:29:53,782
Did you see

235
00:29:53,858 --> 00:29:55,951
the scopes they were using?

236
00:29:56,027 --> 00:29:58,086
They weren't hunters, L.T.

237
00:29:58,162 --> 00:29:59,959
They were sweepers.

238
00:30:00,031 --> 00:30:01,931
You're going to have
to come in, son.

239
00:32:13,397 --> 00:32:14,625
Move up.

240
00:32:20,872 --> 00:32:22,339
-He's down.
-Down. He's down!

241
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:23,930
Stay back.
Don't touch him.

242
00:32:24,041 --> 00:32:25,406
I found a weapon.

243
00:32:26,644 --> 00:32:27,702
We see you!

244
00:32:27,812 --> 00:32:29,040
D2, move in.

245
00:32:29,113 --> 00:32:31,445
Call it in!

246
00:32:31,516 --> 00:32:33,245
Move in!

247
00:32:33,317 --> 00:32:34,978
30 yards on your right!

248
00:32:35,052 --> 00:32:37,145
Bring him in.

249
00:32:37,221 --> 00:32:38,813
Clear it out!

250
00:33:26,204 --> 00:33:27,432
L.T.

251
00:33:27,538 --> 00:33:28,630
Harry.

252
00:33:28,739 --> 00:33:30,001
You did a hell of a job.

253
00:33:30,074 --> 00:33:31,098
Thanks.

254
00:33:31,209 --> 00:33:32,676
He's one of yours, isn't he?

255
00:33:32,743 --> 00:33:34,472
-Yeah.
-That's what I thought.

256
00:33:34,545 --> 00:33:35,739
-He's our man?
-Yeah.

257
00:33:35,813 --> 00:33:36,802
Any idea why?

258
00:33:36,881 --> 00:33:37,813
No.

259
00:33:37,882 --> 00:33:39,076
That'd be your job.

260
00:33:43,387 --> 00:33:44,979
Would you like some coffee?

261
00:33:45,056 --> 00:33:46,489
No, thank you, ma'am.

262
00:33:46,557 --> 00:33:48,491
You don't have to talk to us

263
00:33:48,559 --> 00:33:50,026
if you don't want to.

264
00:33:50,094 --> 00:33:52,358
I understand that.

265
00:33:52,430 --> 00:33:54,227
How about telling us your name?

266
00:33:54,332 --> 00:33:57,893
We could start with that.

267
00:33:58,002 --> 00:34:00,436
He knows my name.

268
00:34:00,538 --> 00:34:01,664
Why don't you tell me

269
00:34:01,739 --> 00:34:03,229
What happened in the woods?

270
00:34:03,341 --> 00:34:04,467
Did you know

271
00:34:04,542 --> 00:34:06,169
six billion chickens will die

272
00:34:06,277 --> 00:34:07,938
in slaughterhouses this year?

273
00:34:08,012 --> 00:34:09,536
What does that have to do

274
00:34:09,614 --> 00:34:11,445
with what happened
in Silver Falls?

275
00:34:11,515 --> 00:34:14,951
What if there was a species
above us in the food chain?

276
00:34:15,019 --> 00:34:16,680
How do you think you'd feel

277
00:34:16,754 --> 00:34:19,746
if that species
lost total respect for us

278
00:34:19,824 --> 00:34:22,759
and started
slaughtering us, Wholesale?

279
00:34:24,228 --> 00:34:28,824
I don't know...
but it's very interesting.

280
00:34:30,201 --> 00:34:32,101
Do you understand it?

281
00:34:32,203 --> 00:34:34,103
Oh, yeah.

282
00:34:34,205 --> 00:34:35,194
Good.

283
00:34:35,306 --> 00:34:38,173
What is it you want
to tell Mr. Bonham

284
00:34:38,242 --> 00:34:41,109
you don't want to tell me?

285
00:34:41,178 --> 00:34:43,544
I'd like to talk to him
about Operation Black Eagle

286
00:34:43,614 --> 00:34:44,672
and Mongoose, Cobra...

287
00:34:44,749 --> 00:34:46,444
Shut up! You want to get
yourself killed?

288
00:34:46,517 --> 00:34:47,541
His name is Aaron Hallam.

289
00:34:47,618 --> 00:34:49,017
Sergeant First Class
Aaron Hallam.

290
00:34:49,086 --> 00:34:50,678
You do remember me, sir.

291
00:34:50,755 --> 00:34:51,949
You're talking about shit
that never happened.

292
00:34:52,023 --> 00:34:52,955
They're recording this, bud.

293
00:34:53,024 --> 00:34:54,048
Good. Then there'll be a record.

294
00:34:54,125 --> 00:34:55,057
And that record will never say

295
00:34:55,126 --> 00:34:56,115
What you want it to say,
Will it?

296
00:34:56,193 --> 00:34:58,923
Then what am I doing here,
people?

297
00:34:58,996 --> 00:35:00,691
Mort, you have got
to help me out here.

298
00:35:00,765 --> 00:35:01,857
Is this our guy or not?

299
00:35:04,335 --> 00:35:06,064
I know there
are variables, Mort.

300
00:35:06,170 --> 00:35:09,469
There are always variables,
but we can't indict a variable.

301
00:35:09,573 --> 00:35:10,699
Hey, boss.

302
00:35:15,079 --> 00:35:18,014
Sir, we understand you have
a man named Aaron Hallam

303
00:35:18,082 --> 00:35:20,016
in your custody.

304
00:35:20,084 --> 00:35:22,075
How much do you know
about Mr. Hallam?

305
00:35:24,689 --> 00:35:26,623
Born in 1 968.

306
00:35:26,691 --> 00:35:28,625
raised in Barrow County,
West Virginia.

307
00:35:28,693 --> 00:35:31,127
High school equivalency,

308
00:35:31,195 --> 00:35:34,824
although he scored
off the charts in science.

309
00:35:34,899 --> 00:35:38,130
Joined the Army at 18.

310
00:35:38,202 --> 00:35:40,670
That's the strange part.

311
00:35:40,738 --> 00:35:42,296
What's that, sir?

312
00:35:42,406 --> 00:35:45,341
Well, it doesn't really
tell us any more about him.

313
00:35:45,409 --> 00:35:48,344
The record's incomplete.

314
00:35:48,412 --> 00:35:51,006
Not even a date of discharge.

315
00:35:51,082 --> 00:35:53,550
Sergeant Hallam
is unofficially listed

316
00:35:53,617 --> 00:35:55,346
as missing in action, sir.

317
00:35:55,419 --> 00:35:58,013
Unofficially?

318
00:35:58,089 --> 00:36:00,421
That's a cover.

319
00:36:00,491 --> 00:36:02,925
That means he's
still doing work for you.

320
00:36:02,993 --> 00:36:05,757
We're here to take possession
of your prisoner, sir.

321
00:36:05,830 --> 00:36:09,891
This is not a military base.

322
00:36:09,967 --> 00:36:12,959
Your man very likely
killed and mutilated

323
00:36:13,070 --> 00:36:15,265
four hunters on federal land.

324
00:36:18,342 --> 00:36:21,778
I think you should take
a look at this... sir.

325
00:36:23,814 --> 00:36:26,749
Unless we've been invaded
by a foreign power

326
00:36:26,817 --> 00:36:29,752
and are officially at war,

327
00:36:29,820 --> 00:36:32,618
you don't have
any authority here.

328
00:36:44,769 --> 00:36:46,600
Look, I know you want
to get out of here,

329
00:36:46,670 --> 00:36:48,399
but we're waiting
on the blood results,

330
00:36:48,506 --> 00:36:49,632
and I need your statement.

331
00:36:49,740 --> 00:36:50,900
You ever used that thing?

332
00:36:50,975 --> 00:36:52,670
Do you mean
did I ever shoot anyone?

333
00:36:52,743 --> 00:36:53,675
Yeah.

334
00:36:53,744 --> 00:36:55,302
Would you ask a guy
the same question?

335
00:36:55,413 --> 00:36:56,675
Yeah.

336
00:36:56,747 --> 00:36:59,682
Well, as a matter
of fact, I have.

337
00:36:59,750 --> 00:37:00,876
Do we have to go into it?

338
00:37:00,951 --> 00:37:01,883
No.

339
00:37:01,952 --> 00:37:03,249
Okay.

340
00:37:15,499 --> 00:37:17,660
Not a great view of the city.

341
00:37:19,170 --> 00:37:22,606
It's a wilderness.

342
00:37:25,342 --> 00:37:26,741
What's your
relationship to Hallam?

343
00:37:26,811 --> 00:37:29,075
I trained him.

344
00:37:29,146 --> 00:37:30,272
To do what?

345
00:37:30,347 --> 00:37:32,474
Trained him to survive...

346
00:37:32,550 --> 00:37:35,576
I trained him to kill.

347
00:37:35,653 --> 00:37:37,120
I trained a lot
of people like him--

348
00:37:37,188 --> 00:37:39,156
you know, the best
of the best, shit like that.

349
00:37:39,223 --> 00:37:42,818
I pulled your file.

350
00:37:42,893 --> 00:37:44,292
You were never in the military.

351
00:37:44,361 --> 00:37:45,521
No.

352
00:37:47,598 --> 00:37:48,963
You just worked for them.

353
00:37:49,033 --> 00:37:51,627
Yeah.

354
00:37:51,702 --> 00:37:52,999
Like a contractor.

355
00:37:53,070 --> 00:37:55,004
Yeah.

356
00:37:55,072 --> 00:37:58,007
You don't like to
talk about it, do you?

357
00:37:58,075 --> 00:37:59,303
No.

358
00:38:03,614 --> 00:38:07,550
My father was a...
Army colonel.

359
00:38:07,618 --> 00:38:09,483
When my older brother
was killed in Vietnam,

360
00:38:09,553 --> 00:38:11,487
he decided he wasn't
going to lose another son

361
00:38:11,555 --> 00:38:12,544
to that particular war.

362
00:38:12,623 --> 00:38:13,885
End of story.

363
00:38:13,958 --> 00:38:16,927
Dad was a tracker
before he joined the Army,

364
00:38:16,994 --> 00:38:19,258
and I learned
what I do from him.

365
00:38:23,667 --> 00:38:25,225
What about Hallam?

366
00:38:25,336 --> 00:38:26,428
He's unusual.

367
00:38:26,537 --> 00:38:29,973
He can kill anybody...
Without regret.

368
00:38:31,342 --> 00:38:32,570
Most of the people he killed

369
00:38:32,676 --> 00:38:35,304
never knew he was
in the same room with them.

370
00:38:37,348 --> 00:38:38,940
How do you feel about that?

371
00:38:39,016 --> 00:38:39,948
Well, I don't know.

372
00:38:40,017 --> 00:38:41,609
I never had
to kill anybody myself. I...

373
00:38:45,689 --> 00:38:47,987
I just taught people how.

374
00:39:13,751 --> 00:39:17,118
In many ways,
Hallam is a fine warrior.

375
00:39:17,187 --> 00:39:19,781
After a tour in Kosovo,
he was given another

376
00:39:19,857 --> 00:39:24,317
sensitive assignment...
off the books.

377
00:39:25,829 --> 00:39:29,265
He went too far.

378
00:39:29,366 --> 00:39:33,268
A lot of innocent people
lost their lives.

379
00:39:33,337 --> 00:39:35,965
Hallam's battle stress

380
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:40,272
has become so deep,
it is a part of his personality,

381
00:39:40,377 --> 00:39:42,971
and it's impossible to reverse.

382
00:39:43,047 --> 00:39:44,674
He's a killing machine.

383
00:39:44,748 --> 00:39:47,478
There is no way
he can be indicted

384
00:39:47,551 --> 00:39:50,543
or tried in open court,
or any court.

385
00:39:50,621 --> 00:39:53,249
He cannot be processed,
interviewed,

386
00:39:53,324 --> 00:39:56,953
charged with a crime,
or copped out as a psycho.

387
00:39:57,027 --> 00:39:59,495
His picture cannot appear
in any newspaper.

388
00:39:59,563 --> 00:40:02,555
As far as the world
is concerned, sir,

389
00:40:02,633 --> 00:40:04,999
Aaron Hallam doesn't exist.

390
00:40:39,737 --> 00:40:42,001
He's one of them.

391
00:40:44,575 --> 00:40:47,339
They'll handle it.

392
00:41:40,431 --> 00:41:42,956
You know why you're here, Aaron.

393
00:41:43,033 --> 00:41:46,901
You wandered off the range.

394
00:41:49,573 --> 00:41:51,803
It was way too messy, man.

395
00:41:51,875 --> 00:41:54,366
You're supposed to be precise.

396
00:41:54,545 --> 00:41:56,604
They weren't his family.

397
00:41:56,680 --> 00:41:58,841
They were soldiers, Dale.

398
00:41:58,916 --> 00:42:01,680
There was no backup,
no way for me to get out.

399
00:42:01,752 --> 00:42:03,014
I was set up.

400
00:42:03,087 --> 00:42:04,714
That's bullshit.

401
00:42:04,788 --> 00:42:06,847
You fucked up.

402
00:42:06,924 --> 00:42:09,188
Your actions resulted
in the injury and death

403
00:42:09,259 --> 00:42:10,283
of unarmed civilians.

404
00:42:10,394 --> 00:42:12,259
They had weapons.

405
00:42:13,831 --> 00:42:17,232
Well, you know,
that's the problem...

406
00:42:17,301 --> 00:42:20,327
you can't tell the sharks
from the guppies anymore.

407
00:42:39,389 --> 00:42:42,017
That's what they're using now?

408
00:42:42,092 --> 00:42:44,026
It's supposed to be painless.

409
00:42:44,094 --> 00:42:46,289
Of course, he'd never
use it on himself...

410
00:42:47,831 --> 00:42:50,322
Release him, Aaron!
Release him now!

411
00:43:01,011 --> 00:43:02,273
You flying to Vancouver?

412
00:43:02,412 --> 00:43:03,572
Yeah.

413
00:43:03,647 --> 00:43:04,739
Then a connecting flight?

414
00:43:04,815 --> 00:43:07,249
No. I drive.
It takes about eight hours.

415
00:43:07,317 --> 00:43:09,808
That's right-- you don't like
flying much.

416
00:43:09,887 --> 00:43:11,286
Must be worth it.

417
00:43:11,421 --> 00:43:12,615
It's a very special place.

418
00:43:12,689 --> 00:43:14,088
You ought to come up sometime.

419
00:43:14,158 --> 00:43:15,182
I think you'd like it.

420
00:43:15,259 --> 00:43:17,853
You wouldn't have to wear
two guns all the time.

421
00:43:17,928 --> 00:43:20,294
I mean, your whole posture
would... change.

422
00:43:20,364 --> 00:43:23,390
It's an open invitation.

423
00:44:17,054 --> 00:44:20,581
Is it painless, Dale?

424
00:44:22,292 --> 00:44:24,123
We need paramedics here!

425
00:44:24,194 --> 00:44:25,855
It's going to explode!

426
00:44:25,929 --> 00:44:27,794
See if you can help him.

427
00:44:27,898 --> 00:44:28,728
No, I can't!

428
00:44:28,799 --> 00:44:30,562
Somebody help that guy.

429
00:44:30,667 --> 00:44:33,135
Does anyone know
what's going on?

430
00:44:33,203 --> 00:44:36,297
Is anyone on the way?

431
00:44:36,406 --> 00:44:37,338
Paramedic.

432
00:44:37,474 --> 00:44:38,498
Are you all right?

433
00:44:38,609 --> 00:44:39,701
Paramedic.

434
00:44:39,810 --> 00:44:40,777
Okay, call 91 1.

435
00:44:40,844 --> 00:44:42,141
I'm okay, I'm okay.

436
00:44:42,212 --> 00:44:43,839
My buddies are in there.

437
00:44:43,914 --> 00:44:46,815
Get 'em out, get 'em out!

438
00:44:49,887 --> 00:44:52,253
I'm okay. I'm okay.

439
00:44:54,424 --> 00:44:55,356
Okay?

440
00:44:55,425 --> 00:44:58,223
They're coming.

441
00:44:58,295 --> 00:45:00,695
Horrible, yeah.

442
00:45:03,967 --> 00:45:05,366
Get 'em out!

443
00:45:05,469 --> 00:45:07,096
Hello?

444
00:45:07,204 --> 00:45:08,398
Oh, shit!

445
00:45:08,505 --> 00:45:10,439
I can't hear you--
you're breaking up.

446
00:45:20,317 --> 00:45:23,514
Please do not leave
your bags unattended.

447
00:45:23,587 --> 00:45:26,715
All unattended bags
will be confiscated.

448
00:45:26,790 --> 00:45:28,155
All right, now,
you go over there

449
00:45:28,225 --> 00:45:29,920
-Okay, yeah.
-and I'll go over there, okay?

450
00:45:29,993 --> 00:45:30,925
All right.

451
00:45:30,994 --> 00:45:32,393
-Aah!
-Come on, come on, come on.

452
00:45:32,462 --> 00:45:33,394
One, two, three,

453
00:45:33,463 --> 00:45:36,899
four, five, six,

454
00:45:36,934 --> 00:45:40,700
seven, eight, nine, ten.

455
00:45:40,804 --> 00:45:44,069
Ready or not, here I come.

456
00:45:45,142 --> 00:45:46,109
...31 points.

457
00:45:46,176 --> 00:45:48,076
It was only the fourth loss
in the last...

458
00:45:48,145 --> 00:45:51,205
May I have your attention
please.

459
00:45:51,281 --> 00:45:55,149
This is the last call
for flight 233...

460
00:45:55,218 --> 00:45:56,845
In other action,

461
00:45:56,920 --> 00:45:58,046
The 76ers 89 to 82.

462
00:45:58,121 --> 00:46:01,090
Jerry Stackhouse scored
29 points for the Pistons...

463
00:46:01,158 --> 00:46:02,216
Hey.

464
00:46:02,292 --> 00:46:04,192
...capitalizing on 14
second half turnovers

465
00:46:04,261 --> 00:46:05,489
by the 76ers.

466
00:46:05,562 --> 00:46:08,497
Alan Iverson who's been
hampered by injuries...

467
00:46:09,766 --> 00:46:11,461
...all season long,
remains on the bench,

468
00:46:11,568 --> 00:46:13,661
and it's still not known
when he will return

469
00:46:13,770 --> 00:46:14,964
to the starting lineup.

470
00:46:15,072 --> 00:46:18,098
Raptors' star Vince Carter
has also been nagged by injuries

471
00:46:18,208 --> 00:46:19,175
all season long,

472
00:46:19,276 --> 00:46:21,267
and can do very little
to help his teammates...

473
00:46:23,347 --> 00:46:25,679
...seems bound and determined...

474
00:46:25,749 --> 00:46:27,614
We have a breaking story.

475
00:46:27,684 --> 00:46:29,549
We're going to our
correspondent, Jeff Gianola,

476
00:46:29,619 --> 00:46:33,385
Who is live outside
the tunnel to Forest Park.

477
00:46:33,457 --> 00:46:34,549
Jeff?

478
00:46:34,624 --> 00:46:36,717
Ken, we have just arrived
on the scene

479
00:46:36,793 --> 00:46:38,624
of a terrible accident outside
the tunnel

480
00:46:38,695 --> 00:46:39,821
in Forest Park.

481
00:46:39,896 --> 00:46:42,023
This is some type of truck,
some type of van

482
00:46:42,099 --> 00:46:43,532
that was transporting people.

483
00:46:43,600 --> 00:46:45,033
We can tell you there are...

484
00:46:48,472 --> 00:46:51,202
Arm... drop...

485
00:46:51,308 --> 00:46:52,798
...recover.

486
00:46:53,944 --> 00:46:57,004
Arm... drop... recover.

487
00:46:57,080 --> 00:46:59,310
I will teach you
how to kill...

488
00:46:59,383 --> 00:47:01,749
quickly, accurately,
efficiently.

489
00:47:03,153 --> 00:47:06,179
It will become a reflex action.

490
00:47:06,256 --> 00:47:08,850
You will learn how to enter
a combat zone

491
00:47:08,925 --> 00:47:10,586
and evaporate into shadow.

492
00:47:10,660 --> 00:47:14,619
You will learn how to survive...
or you will not.

493
00:47:14,698 --> 00:47:17,064
Ready?

494
00:47:17,167 --> 00:47:21,467
Arm... heart...
Ieg, leg... Iung.

495
00:47:21,571 --> 00:47:22,663
Reverse your grip.

496
00:47:22,773 --> 00:47:24,741
Bring your knife on the inside
of his arm here,

497
00:47:24,841 --> 00:47:26,206
sever all the connective tissue,

498
00:47:26,276 --> 00:47:28,039
pulling his finger
away from the trigger,

499
00:47:28,111 --> 00:47:30,443
and at the same time, coming
around his left shoulder,

500
00:47:30,514 --> 00:47:31,640
grab the strap, choke him.

501
00:47:31,715 --> 00:47:32,647
Now come into his heart

502
00:47:32,716 --> 00:47:33,978
through the top of his sternum

503
00:47:34,051 --> 00:47:35,245
and bring him to the ground.

504
00:47:35,318 --> 00:47:36,250
Very good.

505
00:47:36,319 --> 00:47:37,251
Go.

506
00:47:37,320 --> 00:47:40,653
Arm, throat, heart,
leg, leg, arm, lung.

507
00:47:40,724 --> 00:47:41,656
Good. Good.

508
00:47:41,725 --> 00:47:43,090
Into the thigh here,

509
00:47:43,160 --> 00:47:45,287
slice through that thigh
and the femoral artery,

510
00:47:45,429 --> 00:47:47,488
into this thigh
and that femoral artery.

511
00:47:47,597 --> 00:47:49,997
You will notice that
this arm is in your way.

512
00:47:50,033 --> 00:47:51,000
It cannot hurt you.

513
00:47:51,068 --> 00:47:53,195
The only thing this arm
can do to hurt you

514
00:47:53,303 --> 00:47:55,601
is block the lung puncture
you're about to do.

515
00:47:55,705 --> 00:47:57,730
Push this arm over
in front of his face,

516
00:47:57,841 --> 00:47:59,069
go into his lung.

517
00:47:59,142 --> 00:48:02,805
Now, arm, neck, heart,
leg, leg, lung.

518
00:48:02,879 --> 00:48:05,074
One, two, three,
four, five, six.

519
00:48:05,148 --> 00:48:07,981
One... two... three...

520
00:48:08,051 --> 00:48:12,000
power assist four...
five... six.

521
00:48:12,100 --> 00:48:13,838
One, two, three, four,
five, six.

522
00:48:13,908 --> 00:48:15,808
One, two, three,
four, five, six.

523
00:48:15,877 --> 00:48:17,845
One, two, three, four,
five, six.

524
00:48:17,912 --> 00:48:19,880
Make this cut
a good power assist.

525
00:48:19,948 --> 00:48:21,813
You're looking
for his backbone.

526
00:48:21,916 --> 00:48:23,315
Here we go.

527
00:48:26,287 --> 00:48:27,219
Go.

528
00:48:28,389 --> 00:48:29,321
There we go.

529
00:48:29,390 --> 00:48:30,755
Once again.

530
00:48:34,963 --> 00:48:37,659
"L.T....

531
00:48:38,900 --> 00:48:42,165
"I don't think
I can do this anymore.

532
00:48:42,237 --> 00:48:44,501
"The nightmares
are getting worse.

533
00:48:46,407 --> 00:48:50,867
"I think I'm losing it, L.T.

534
00:48:50,945 --> 00:48:52,879
"I need to talk to you.

535
00:49:03,124 --> 00:49:04,182
"I don't know

536
00:49:04,259 --> 00:49:07,558
"if you've been getting
my letters, L.T.

537
00:49:07,629 --> 00:49:12,123
"I need to hear from you
or talk to you.

538
00:49:12,200 --> 00:49:15,169
"You've been like a father
to me.

539
00:49:15,236 --> 00:49:17,033
Please write."

540
00:49:20,542 --> 00:49:23,409
Once you are able
to kill mentally,

541
00:49:23,478 --> 00:49:26,140
the physical part will be easy.

542
00:49:26,214 --> 00:49:29,706
The difficult part...

543
00:49:29,818 --> 00:49:32,218
is learning how
to turn it off.

544
00:49:37,692 --> 00:49:39,387
At this point,
all we know for sure

545
00:49:39,460 --> 00:49:41,621
is that we have three
confirmed fatalities.

546
00:49:41,696 --> 00:49:44,460
We don't know whether or not
there were any other passengers

547
00:49:44,532 --> 00:49:45,931
inside this van
when it crashed.

548
00:49:46,034 --> 00:49:47,524
Access is very limited.

549
00:49:47,602 --> 00:49:51,538
We have no new information from
either the police or the FBl.

550
00:49:51,606 --> 00:49:55,098
However, the van appears to be
a military-type vehicle,

551
00:49:55,176 --> 00:49:58,202
possibly the type of vehicle
used to transport prisoners.

552
00:49:58,279 --> 00:50:00,543
We'll try to get some
confirmation on that.

553
00:50:00,648 --> 00:50:02,582
Once again,
information very sketchy.

554
00:50:02,650 --> 00:50:04,413
Rescue crew's still
on the scene,

555
00:50:04,519 --> 00:50:06,544
along with FBl agents
and technicians.

556
00:50:06,654 --> 00:50:10,590
We're getting no comment from
the FBl agents on the scene.

557
00:50:10,692 --> 00:50:12,182
What happened?

558
00:50:12,293 --> 00:50:13,624
Hallam's loose.

559
00:50:31,079 --> 00:50:32,842
Hello, Irene.

560
00:50:32,914 --> 00:50:34,779
Oh, Aaron.

561
00:50:34,883 --> 00:50:36,578
You scared me.

562
00:50:36,684 --> 00:50:38,208
It's good to see you.

563
00:50:38,286 --> 00:50:40,311
I'm not listening
to you no more, Aaron.

564
00:50:40,388 --> 00:50:42,015
Everything you
told me was a lie.

565
00:50:42,156 --> 00:50:43,885
I've never lied to you, Irene.

566
00:50:43,958 --> 00:50:46,483
Where have you been
the last six months?

567
00:50:46,594 --> 00:50:47,891
Doing stuff for the government.

568
00:50:47,962 --> 00:50:50,055
That's a lie, Aaron,
that's a damn lie.

569
00:50:50,164 --> 00:50:51,358
Get out of here.

570
00:50:51,432 --> 00:50:53,161
I don't want to see you again.

571
00:50:53,234 --> 00:50:56,226
Aaron?

572
00:50:56,304 --> 00:50:58,067
Aaron, you're back!

573
00:50:58,139 --> 00:50:59,367
Hey, Loretta.

574
00:51:00,375 --> 00:51:01,307
Hey.

575
00:51:01,376 --> 00:51:02,502
It's so good
to see you.

576
00:51:02,577 --> 00:51:04,044
I missed you so much.

577
00:51:04,112 --> 00:51:05,340
How's my big girl?

578
00:51:05,413 --> 00:51:06,846
Where have you been?

579
00:51:10,184 --> 00:51:11,947
Loretta, I need you
to start your homework.

580
00:51:12,053 --> 00:51:14,521
Can I visit
with Aaron some more?

581
00:51:14,589 --> 00:51:16,284
You can visit with him later.

582
00:51:16,391 --> 00:51:17,551
Are you staying
for dinner, Aaron?

583
00:51:17,659 --> 00:51:19,320
Go do your homework.

584
00:51:24,299 --> 00:51:26,233
Don't think
you're just going to step

585
00:51:26,301 --> 00:51:27,996
right back
into our lives, Aaron.

586
00:51:28,102 --> 00:51:29,091
I understand, Irene.

587
00:51:29,170 --> 00:51:31,604
I don't even know
what you do for a living.

588
00:51:34,709 --> 00:51:36,836
Did you look in my locker?

589
00:51:36,911 --> 00:51:38,401
How could I do that?

590
00:51:38,479 --> 00:51:41,073
You have
four locks on the thing.

591
00:51:50,825 --> 00:51:53,385
What track is that?

592
00:51:56,464 --> 00:51:57,431
A squirrel.

593
00:51:57,498 --> 00:51:58,430
That's right.

594
00:51:58,499 --> 00:52:00,558
Where's the nex one?

595
00:52:00,635 --> 00:52:01,602
Um...

596
00:52:01,669 --> 00:52:03,330
Bring it down.
Where's the nex one?

597
00:52:03,404 --> 00:52:05,133
I can't tell.

598
00:52:05,206 --> 00:52:07,265
Hold it flat.

599
00:52:09,811 --> 00:52:12,336
See? Every nine inches.

600
00:52:12,413 --> 00:52:14,244
That's the gallop pattern.

601
00:52:14,349 --> 00:52:15,941
Every nine inches.

602
00:52:16,050 --> 00:52:18,245
Oh, yeah, I see.

603
00:52:18,353 --> 00:52:19,251
What's this one?

604
00:52:19,354 --> 00:52:20,548
That's a raccoon.

605
00:52:20,655 --> 00:52:22,623
How come you never see any?

606
00:52:22,724 --> 00:52:24,658
Well, they hide
to survive.

607
00:52:24,726 --> 00:52:28,560
Men don't respect
animals anymore.

608
00:52:28,629 --> 00:52:31,598
They run them down
or kill them

609
00:52:31,666 --> 00:52:33,133
any chance they get.

610
00:52:33,201 --> 00:52:35,601
I think that's sad.

611
00:52:37,372 --> 00:52:39,602
That's only Kitty.

612
00:52:39,674 --> 00:52:41,904
Here, Kitty.

613
00:52:41,976 --> 00:52:44,240
No, you don't want
to bother him now.

614
00:52:44,312 --> 00:52:45,643
Why?

615
00:52:45,713 --> 00:52:47,010
He's hunting, too.

616
00:52:47,081 --> 00:52:49,242
Does he know we're here?

617
00:52:49,317 --> 00:52:51,012
Oh, he knows.

618
00:52:51,185 --> 00:52:52,652
How?

619
00:52:52,754 --> 00:52:57,987
He can sense it.

620
00:53:04,165 --> 00:53:06,998
She's so happy to see you.

621
00:53:08,336 --> 00:53:10,497
Sit down.

622
00:53:18,913 --> 00:53:21,074
What's this?

623
00:53:27,955 --> 00:53:28,922
You got to leave here.

624
00:53:28,990 --> 00:53:30,389
You got to get out of Portland.

625
00:53:30,458 --> 00:53:31,652
What are you
talking about?

626
00:53:31,726 --> 00:53:33,523
You're in danger, Irene.

627
00:53:33,594 --> 00:53:34,925
Why am I in danger?

628
00:53:34,996 --> 00:53:36,361
You and Loretta.

629
00:53:36,431 --> 00:53:39,628
And they'll come here
and burn this house down.

630
00:53:39,700 --> 00:53:42,362
What are you talking about,
Aaron?

631
00:53:44,572 --> 00:53:47,632
House of Leader--
We got visual.

632
00:53:47,708 --> 00:53:51,303
Copy that.
Stand by for intercept.

633
00:53:59,887 --> 00:54:02,788
All right, sweetie, you
wait for me after school.

634
00:54:02,890 --> 00:54:04,687
I'm going to be there
to pick you up, okay?

635
00:54:04,759 --> 00:54:06,249
All right.
Is everything okay, Mommy?

636
00:54:06,360 --> 00:54:07,657
Everything's fine,
honey.

637
00:54:07,728 --> 00:54:08,717
I love you.

638
00:54:08,796 --> 00:54:09,728
I love you, too.

639
00:54:09,797 --> 00:54:11,264
See you later, alligator.

640
00:54:11,332 --> 00:54:13,857
Bye.

641
00:54:13,935 --> 00:54:16,403
The Leader's approaching
intercept, 6:.00.

642
00:54:16,471 --> 00:54:19,031
Roger that. We got her.

643
00:54:20,708 --> 00:54:23,541
Irene Kravitz?
Agent Durrell.

644
00:54:23,611 --> 00:54:24,873
Is that your little girl?

645
00:54:24,946 --> 00:54:26,174
Loretta, is it?

646
00:54:26,247 --> 00:54:28,147
That's right.

647
00:54:28,249 --> 00:54:29,944
We'd like to talk to you.

648
00:54:30,051 --> 00:54:30,949
About what?

649
00:54:31,119 --> 00:54:32,643
Oh, it's just routine, really,

650
00:54:32,753 --> 00:54:35,153
but it'd be a lot easier
if we talked inside.

651
00:54:35,256 --> 00:54:38,419
Uh, if you make us come
back with a warrant,

652
00:54:38,493 --> 00:54:41,553
it won't be routine anymore.

653
00:54:41,796 --> 00:54:44,526
Going somewhere, Mrs. Kravitz?

654
00:54:44,599 --> 00:54:49,502
No, I'm just cleaning stuff up,
trying to get organized.

655
00:54:49,570 --> 00:54:51,333
We're looking for a man
named Aaron Hallam.

656
00:54:51,405 --> 00:54:52,736
Have you seen him?

657
00:54:52,807 --> 00:54:54,604
Not for a few months.

658
00:54:54,675 --> 00:54:56,666
But you know him.

659
00:54:56,744 --> 00:54:58,735
This have to do with
his government work?

660
00:54:58,813 --> 00:55:00,906
When's the last
time you saw him?

661
00:55:01,015 --> 00:55:02,573
I don't remember.
A few months ago.

662
00:55:02,650 --> 00:55:06,017
He... sort of took off.

663
00:55:06,087 --> 00:55:07,577
That's the way he is.

664
00:55:07,688 --> 00:55:09,849
Is he here, Irene?

665
00:55:09,957 --> 00:55:11,288
What's this about?

666
00:55:11,359 --> 00:55:12,758
What's Aaron done?

667
00:55:12,827 --> 00:55:15,796
Please have a seat, Irene.

668
00:55:21,636 --> 00:55:23,501
Nobody said he's done anything.

669
00:55:23,571 --> 00:55:26,665
FBl wouldn't be here
if he hadn't done something.

670
00:55:26,741 --> 00:55:29,073
When did you
and Aaron meet?

671
00:55:29,143 --> 00:55:30,804
Eight months ago, maybe.

672
00:55:30,878 --> 00:55:33,039
Stayed here a while,
then he just took off.

673
00:55:33,114 --> 00:55:35,844
He tell you where
he was going?

674
00:55:35,950 --> 00:55:37,884
Mrs. Kravitz, is he still here?

675
00:55:37,952 --> 00:55:39,852
I said I ain't seen him
in months.

676
00:55:39,921 --> 00:55:42,082
How many times
do I have to say that?

677
00:55:43,491 --> 00:55:44,822
Excuse me, sir,
where are you going?

678
00:55:44,892 --> 00:55:46,382
Irene, you wouldn't be
doing him any good

679
00:55:46,494 --> 00:55:48,394
and you wouldn't be
doing your daughter any good--

680
00:55:48,462 --> 00:55:50,953
What do you know
about my daughter?!

681
00:56:21,295 --> 00:56:23,320
You want someone around
for her, I understand that,

682
00:56:23,397 --> 00:56:24,989
but you have to look out
for her safety.

683
00:56:25,066 --> 00:56:26,033
You have to ask yourself,

684
00:56:26,133 --> 00:56:27,293
"Is this
the right kind of guy

685
00:56:27,368 --> 00:56:28,562
to have around
your daughter?"

686
00:56:28,636 --> 00:56:31,070
What has Aaron done?

687
00:56:31,205 --> 00:56:32,968
We just want
to talk to him.

688
00:56:33,040 --> 00:56:36,339
Did he kill somebody?

689
00:57:13,781 --> 00:57:15,715
Come in.

690
00:57:19,520 --> 00:57:22,717
You care about these
people here, Aaron?

691
00:57:22,790 --> 00:57:25,987
You're going
to get them hurt.

692
00:57:26,060 --> 00:57:27,550
You here to sweep me, L.T.?

693
00:57:27,662 --> 00:57:29,186
You know I don't do that.

694
00:57:29,263 --> 00:57:32,357
How do I know that?

695
00:57:34,101 --> 00:57:35,966
They are coming for you.

696
00:57:36,037 --> 00:57:41,498
They've been coming for me
for a long time, L.T.

697
00:57:41,575 --> 00:57:45,067
You have to answer
for what you've done.

698
00:57:45,212 --> 00:57:48,409
I have to live
with what I've done.

699
00:57:50,751 --> 00:57:54,187
You can say
whatever you want.

700
00:57:54,255 --> 00:57:57,952
I don't trust you, L.T.

701
00:58:02,296 --> 00:58:05,595
If you cross this line,

702
00:58:05,666 --> 00:58:08,726
you better be ready
to kill me.

703
00:58:15,142 --> 00:58:17,235
Don't move.

704
00:58:17,311 --> 00:58:20,246
Put your hands on your head
and get on the floor.

705
00:58:23,117 --> 00:58:24,914
I said get on the floor, now.

706
00:58:26,620 --> 00:58:28,520
Get down.

707
00:59:52,573 --> 00:59:54,040
Get on
the sidewalk!

708
01:00:06,153 --> 01:00:07,347
That's a silver star.

709
01:00:10,958 --> 01:00:12,926
That is a sketch that
I made for a knife.

710
01:00:18,632 --> 01:00:20,862
It's addressed to you.

711
01:00:23,337 --> 01:00:27,398
"L.T., those guys you trained
to come and kill me--

712
01:00:27,475 --> 01:00:32,435
they're not soldiers,
they're robots."

713
01:00:34,815 --> 01:00:37,306
We've got a positive ID at the
river-front construction site.

714
01:00:37,384 --> 01:00:38,578
We're headed to that location,

715
01:00:38,686 --> 01:00:39,846
over.

716
01:00:39,954 --> 01:00:41,421
10-9 that location.

717
01:00:47,361 --> 01:00:49,659
This is Agent in Charge
Van Zandt, Agent Moret.

718
01:00:49,730 --> 01:00:50,992
This is site foreman,
Hank Hooker.

719
01:00:51,065 --> 01:00:52,726
One of our guys saw
him pull up over here

720
01:00:52,800 --> 01:00:54,062
near that tunnel
entrance there.

721
01:00:54,134 --> 01:00:55,192
How many men
work down there?

722
01:00:55,302 --> 01:00:57,065
Maybe three dozen.
They're all coming up now.

723
01:00:57,137 --> 01:00:58,161
Wait, we need an exact count.

724
01:00:58,239 --> 01:00:59,604
I need a set of blueprints,
all right?

725
01:00:59,673 --> 01:01:01,538
All right, this is an overview
of the site.

726
01:01:01,609 --> 01:01:03,338
There's four major sections
down there.

727
01:01:03,410 --> 01:01:04,604
He probably went down here

728
01:01:04,678 --> 01:01:06,509
in the red section,
that's tunnels eight through 12.

729
01:01:06,580 --> 01:01:08,445
How far does this
whole thing exend?

730
01:01:08,549 --> 01:01:10,517
About 12 square blocks,
straight into downtown.

731
01:01:10,584 --> 01:01:11,744
We'll cover the red section.

732
01:01:11,852 --> 01:01:12,978
Only our people, Ted.

733
01:01:13,053 --> 01:01:14,850
All right, show me the
other three entrances.

734
01:01:20,828 --> 01:01:21,920
He went in over there.

735
01:01:21,996 --> 01:01:23,429
There's three other
entrances here.

736
01:01:23,497 --> 01:01:25,260
Make sure they're
completely blocked off.

737
01:01:44,952 --> 01:01:46,647
Lock it down!

738
01:02:25,526 --> 01:02:27,153
I got it.

739
01:03:06,033 --> 01:03:08,001
FBI!

740
01:03:08,068 --> 01:03:10,662
Step away from the column
with your hands up.

741
01:03:10,738 --> 01:03:15,004
Let me see your hands.

742
01:03:15,075 --> 01:03:16,702
720, this is Number One.

743
01:03:16,777 --> 01:03:17,835
I need backup right now,

744
01:03:17,911 --> 01:03:21,039
red section, tunnel "A."

745
01:03:21,115 --> 01:03:22,047
Did you hear me?

746
01:03:22,149 --> 01:03:25,778
I said step away
from the column now.

747
01:03:25,853 --> 01:03:28,754
Step away from
the fucking column!

748
01:03:56,083 --> 01:03:58,813
About halfway.

749
01:03:58,886 --> 01:04:00,217
-60.
-Radio's dead.

750
01:04:18,272 --> 01:04:20,638
Shit.

751
01:04:20,708 --> 01:04:22,073
Jesus Christ.

752
01:04:22,142 --> 01:04:23,632
Bobby!

753
01:04:24,978 --> 01:04:26,343
Leave it in!
Don't touch him!

754
01:04:26,413 --> 01:04:28,278
Don't touch him!
Open his mouth.

755
01:04:28,348 --> 01:04:31,078
Keep pressure on the wound.
Keep pressure on the wound.

756
01:04:32,619 --> 01:04:34,280
Command Post,
this is Number Two.

757
01:04:34,354 --> 01:04:37,084
We have an agent down,
sector red, sector red.

758
01:04:44,698 --> 01:04:46,131
Get me them EMTs now ASAP!

759
01:04:46,200 --> 01:04:48,566
Bobby... Bobby...

760
01:04:48,635 --> 01:04:49,932
Bobby, listen to me.

761
01:04:50,003 --> 01:04:50,992
Bobby, listen to me!

762
01:05:23,070 --> 01:05:24,162
Sorry, man.

763
01:09:11,231 --> 01:09:12,994
Hike!

764
01:09:13,100 --> 01:09:14,692
Hike! Hike!

765
01:10:08,588 --> 01:10:10,351
Number Two, Three-Charlie-One.

766
01:10:10,457 --> 01:10:12,084
Subject spotted on foot,
eastbound, number two lane.

767
01:10:12,192 --> 01:10:13,124
Hawthorne Bridge.

768
01:10:13,260 --> 01:10:14,955
Close off both ends
of the bridge.

769
01:10:15,028 --> 01:10:16,893
Two SWAT teams
on the way. Over.

770
01:10:23,537 --> 01:10:25,300
Get everybody off the bridge.

771
01:11:24,731 --> 01:11:26,392
Leave that car!

772
01:11:45,385 --> 01:11:46,784
Excuse me.

773
01:12:05,005 --> 01:12:05,994
Get down!

774
01:12:06,072 --> 01:12:07,596
Let's keep this between us.

775
01:12:07,674 --> 01:12:09,335
Don't get in the way!

776
01:12:09,409 --> 01:12:11,240
Get everybody down on the floor.

777
01:12:17,284 --> 01:12:19,343
Get down, now!

778
01:12:35,302 --> 01:12:37,566
Down! Get down!

779
01:12:37,637 --> 01:12:38,604
He's on the tower!

780
01:12:38,672 --> 01:12:39,934
Target of opportunity!

781
01:12:40,006 --> 01:12:42,372
He's on the tower!

782
01:12:42,442 --> 01:12:43,739
Fire!

783
01:12:59,926 --> 01:13:02,019
Cease fire!

784
01:13:02,128 --> 01:13:05,359
Cease fire!
Hold your fire!

785
01:14:00,220 --> 01:14:03,678
Captain, I need two or three
of your officers on each bridge.

786
01:14:03,790 --> 01:14:05,348
Sweep the western sea wall,

787
01:14:05,458 --> 01:14:07,426
and shut down
the bike paths. SWAT...

788
01:14:07,527 --> 01:14:10,018
I need recon teams
on both sides of the river.

789
01:14:10,196 --> 01:14:11,857
Sniper units to cover
each team's advance.

790
01:14:11,931 --> 01:14:13,489
You can take your people
off the river.

791
01:14:13,566 --> 01:14:15,329
The currents are strong enough
to carry him,

792
01:14:15,402 --> 01:14:16,630
and the kid swims like a fish.

793
01:14:16,703 --> 01:14:18,466
This is our show, Bonham.
This is what we do best.

794
01:14:18,538 --> 01:14:19,698
How many people are
you willing to lose?

795
01:14:19,773 --> 01:14:20,705
Excuse me?

796
01:14:20,774 --> 01:14:21,706
He will kill

797
01:14:21,775 --> 01:14:23,174
-as many of you as he can.
-Bonham...

798
01:14:23,243 --> 01:14:25,336
You better decide now
what's an acceptable body count.

799
01:14:25,412 --> 01:14:26,174
Knock it off!

800
01:14:26,246 --> 01:14:27,338
You want more dead bodies,

801
01:14:27,414 --> 01:14:28,676
that's what you're going to get
if you let these guys

802
01:14:28,748 --> 01:14:30,739
declare war on my boy.

803
01:14:30,850 --> 01:14:33,080
I made him what he is
and I can stop him.

804
01:14:33,153 --> 01:14:35,383
We've lost two of our people--

805
01:14:35,488 --> 01:14:37,922
best agents I ever served with.

806
01:14:37,991 --> 01:14:39,253
Hallam belongs to us.

807
01:15:38,151 --> 01:15:40,051
If you see a wreck in there,
let me know...

808
01:15:40,153 --> 01:15:42,121
We'll get a vehicle down there.

809
01:24:28,714 --> 01:24:30,443
If he's alive, he won't come in.

810
01:24:31,851 --> 01:24:33,113
Right.

811
01:25:55,601 --> 01:25:57,501
-Hallam!
-Get on the ground!

812
01:28:07,867 --> 01:28:11,860
God said to Abraham,
"Kill me a son."

813
01:28:25,317 --> 01:28:29,913
There's a man goin' "round
takin" names

814
01:28:30,022 --> 01:28:35,426
And he decides
Who to free and who to blame

815
01:28:35,494 --> 01:28:40,158
Everybody won't be treated
all the same

816
01:28:40,232 --> 01:28:46,603
There'll be a golden ladder
reaching down

817
01:28:46,672 --> 01:28:50,403
When the man comes around

818
01:28:52,778 --> 01:28:58,045
The hairs on your arm
Will stand up

819
01:28:58,150 --> 01:29:02,610
At the terror in each sip
and in each sup

820
01:29:02,688 --> 01:29:07,489
Will you partake
of that last offered cup

821
01:29:07,560 --> 01:29:14,159
Or disappear
into the potter's ground

822
01:29:14,233 --> 01:29:17,862
When the man comes around?

823
01:29:17,937 --> 01:29:22,897
Hear the trumpets,
hear the pipers

824
01:29:22,975 --> 01:29:27,412
One hundred million angels
singin'

825
01:29:27,479 --> 01:29:34,248
Multitudes are marching
to the big kettle drum

826
01:29:34,320 --> 01:29:38,916
Voices callin',
voices cryin'

827
01:29:39,024 --> 01:29:43,825
Some are born
and some are dyin'

828
01:29:43,896 --> 01:29:47,696
It's Alpha and Omega's
Kingdom come

829
01:29:47,766 --> 01:29:53,830
And the whirlwind is
in the thorn tree

830
01:29:53,906 --> 01:29:58,843
The virgins are
all trimming their wicks

831
01:29:58,911 --> 01:30:03,541
The whirlwind is
in the thorn tree

832
01:30:03,649 --> 01:30:07,312
It's hard for thee to kick
against the priest

833
01:30:10,756 --> 01:30:15,750
Till Armageddon,
no Shalam, no Shalom

834
01:30:15,828 --> 01:30:21,130
Then the father hen will call
his chickens home

835
01:30:21,267 --> 01:30:26,136
The wise men will bow down
before the throne

836
01:30:26,238 --> 01:30:31,301
And at his feet they'll cast
their golden crowns

837
01:30:31,377 --> 01:30:36,110
When the man comes around

838
01:30:36,181 --> 01:30:41,483
Whoever is unjust,
let him be unjust still

839
01:30:41,587 --> 01:30:46,081
Whoever is righteous,
let him be righteous still

840
01:30:46,191 --> 01:30:50,855
Whoever is filthy,
let him be filthy still

841
01:30:50,929 --> 01:30:56,834
Listen to the words
long written down

842
01:30:56,902 --> 01:31:00,838
When the man comes around

843
01:31:00,906 --> 01:31:05,343
Hear the trumpets,
hear the pipers

844
01:31:05,411 --> 01:31:10,178
One hundred million angels
singin'

845
01:31:10,249 --> 01:31:16,711
Multitudes are marchin'
to the big kettle drum

846
01:31:16,822 --> 01:31:21,350
Voices callin',
voices cryin'

847
01:31:21,460 --> 01:31:26,227
Some are born
and some are dyin'

848
01:31:26,298 --> 01:31:31,133
It's Alpha and Omega's
Kingdom come

849
01:31:31,203 --> 01:31:36,266
And the whirlwind is
in the thorn tree

850
01:31:36,342 --> 01:31:40,904
The virgins are
all trimming their wicks

851
01:31:40,979 --> 01:31:46,042
The whirlwind is
in the thorn tree

852
01:31:46,118 --> 01:31:50,953
It's hard for thee to kick
against the priest

853
01:31:51,023 --> 01:31:56,757
In measured hundredweight
and penny pound

854
01:31:56,829 --> 01:31:59,229
When the man comes around.
