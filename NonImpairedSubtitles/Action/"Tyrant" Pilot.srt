1
00:00:01,972 --> 00:00:04,073
(birds chirping)

2
00:00:19,222 --> 00:00:21,657
(sighs)

3
00:00:22,925 --> 00:00:25,894
(line ringing)

4
00:00:25,962 --> 00:00:27,929
This is Fauzi Nidal.

5
00:00:27,997 --> 00:00:29,865
Leave a message and
I'll call you back.

6
00:00:29,932 --> 00:00:31,699
(beep)

7
00:00:31,768 --> 00:00:34,602
Fauzi, it's, uh... it's me again.
Barry.

8
00:00:34,670 --> 00:00:36,204
Um... Bassam.

9
00:00:36,272 --> 00:00:39,674
Uh, I'm not sure if you're
getting my messages,

10
00:00:39,742 --> 00:00:43,678
but, um, I'm coming for
my nephew's wedding.

11
00:00:43,746 --> 00:00:45,846
Uh, arriving tomorrow.

12
00:00:45,914 --> 00:00:50,184
My US cell number
should work, so, uh...

13
00:00:50,252 --> 00:00:51,919
so call me.

14
00:00:51,987 --> 00:00:55,523
It would be good to see you.

15
00:00:55,591 --> 00:00:57,892
(panting)

16
00:01:06,467 --> 00:01:07,734
(indistinct shouting)

17
00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:12,840
(indistinct shouting)

18
00:01:18,913 --> 00:01:21,114
(indistinct shouting)

19
00:01:33,027 --> 00:01:37,931
Jamal, fix your button.

20
00:01:37,998 --> 00:01:41,634
How do you expect people to respect
you if you can't dress yourself?

21
00:01:47,007 --> 00:01:48,907
(indistinct shouting)

22
00:01:50,043 --> 00:01:52,445
Jamal. Bassam.

23
00:01:52,512 --> 00:01:53,746
Come on, Jamal. Come out.

24
00:01:53,814 --> 00:01:56,515
Khaled! Khaled! Khaled!

25
00:01:56,583 --> 00:02:00,986
Khaled! Khaled! Khaled! Khaled!

26
00:02:01,054 --> 00:02:03,756
Khaled! Khaled!

27
00:02:03,824 --> 00:02:05,724
KHALED: Wave, Jamal.

28
00:02:06,792 --> 00:02:09,962
Not like a girl. Wave.

29
00:02:16,069 --> 00:02:18,237
Jamal, go stand over there.

30
00:02:22,928 --> 00:02:24,282
Mr. President.

31
00:02:24,317 --> 00:02:26,911
KHALED: My son will
cut the ribbon.

32
00:02:33,018 --> 00:02:38,322
It is a great honor... to
be standing here with you,

33
00:02:38,390 --> 00:02:40,724
the good people of Ma'an.

34
00:02:40,792 --> 00:02:42,960
(cheering and applause)

35
00:02:49,067 --> 00:02:54,138
This ground, once stained
with the blood and tears

36
00:02:54,206 --> 00:03:01,011
of conflict, has been cleansed
by the sweat of your good work.

37
00:03:01,078 --> 00:03:03,046
(cheering)

38
00:03:03,114 --> 00:03:07,284
This bridge is more than
just steel and concrete.

39
00:03:07,351 --> 00:03:12,355
It is a symbol that despite
our differences...

40
00:03:14,125 --> 00:03:16,059
(gunfire)

41
00:03:17,875 --> 00:03:19,662
Get down, Bassam!

42
00:03:19,697 --> 00:03:21,531
(muffled gunfire, shouting)

43
00:03:27,838 --> 00:03:29,739
(phone ringing)

44
00:03:29,807 --> 00:03:31,340
(panting)

45
00:03:38,048 --> 00:03:40,416
BARRY: Hello, Mrs. Shapiro.

46
00:03:40,484 --> 00:03:42,885
MRS. SHAPIRO: I'm sorry to
call so early, Doctor, but

47
00:03:42,953 --> 00:03:44,253
Danny's been coughing all night.

48
00:03:44,321 --> 00:03:47,352
BARRY: Uh, well, uh, Dr. Chang

49
00:03:47,387 --> 00:03:49,724
is covering my patients this week,
so let me give you his service number...

50
00:03:49,792 --> 00:03:53,028
MRS. SHAPIRO: I'm sure he's
fine, but I really trust you.

51
00:03:53,096 --> 00:03:54,229
BARRY: I'm glad you trust me,

52
00:03:54,297 --> 00:03:58,067
but he's an excellent doctor and
I'm about to leave town, s...

53
00:03:58,134 --> 00:04:01,803
MRS. SHAPIRO: I get that you're
busy, but what if he has strep?

54
00:04:01,871 --> 00:04:06,508
BARRY: No, I, uh, I
understand, I do, uh...

55
00:04:06,576 --> 00:04:08,543
I'll be at my office
in ten minutes.

56
00:04:08,611 --> 00:04:10,178
MRS. SHAPIRO: Thank
you, Dr. Al Fayeed.

57
00:04:10,245 --> 00:04:12,046
BARRY: Okay. Bye.

58
00:04:12,114 --> 00:04:14,282
(sighs)

59
00:04:14,350 --> 00:04:16,651
I can't believe you're
making us go to this wedding

60
00:04:16,719 --> 00:04:18,453
when they're burning pictures
of Grandpa on the street.

61
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:19,587
Emma, get off the Internet.

62
00:04:19,654 --> 00:04:22,790
EMMA: And they burned down the bakery
where the wedding cake was being made.

63
00:04:22,858 --> 00:04:24,892
(boy chuckles)

64
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:27,928
And you think this is funny?
What if they attack us?

65
00:04:27,997 --> 00:04:29,097
No one's attacking us.

66
00:04:29,164 --> 00:04:31,366
And if they do, we'll
have armed escorts.

67
00:04:31,433 --> 00:04:33,067
Dad's father's like a king.

68
00:04:33,135 --> 00:04:36,069
Em, we're royalty over there.

69
00:04:36,137 --> 00:04:38,706
You know, you'll be like Kate Middleton.
Just fat.

70
00:04:38,773 --> 00:04:40,574
Hey, don't talk to
your sister like that.

71
00:04:40,642 --> 00:04:41,375
Come on.

72
00:04:41,442 --> 00:04:43,043
What part of what I
said isn't true?

73
00:04:43,111 --> 00:04:45,145
- Emma...
- Aw, it's cute.

74
00:04:45,213 --> 00:04:47,114
Seriously, can you just
stop with the attitude

75
00:04:47,181 --> 00:04:49,016
and try to appreciate what an
amazing opportunity this is?

76
00:04:49,083 --> 00:04:49,950
Yeah.

77
00:04:50,018 --> 00:04:51,784
EMMA: It's not
just me, you know.

78
00:04:51,852 --> 00:04:53,620
- Dad doesn't want to go either.
- He told you that?

79
00:04:53,687 --> 00:04:55,122
EMMA: He didn't have to.
Isn't it obvious?

80
00:04:55,189 --> 00:04:57,857
Why do you think he hasn't
been back in 20 years?

81
00:04:57,925 --> 00:05:00,093
He doesn't want to go, and
I don't want to go either.

82
00:05:00,161 --> 00:05:01,761
So I'm not going.

83
00:05:01,829 --> 00:05:03,663
You're going.

84
00:05:07,868 --> 00:05:09,802
(kettle whistling)

85
00:05:11,171 --> 00:05:12,338
That was a long run.

86
00:05:12,406 --> 00:05:14,240
You missed all the fun.

87
00:05:14,307 --> 00:05:16,108
BARRY: Medical emergency.

88
00:05:16,176 --> 00:05:17,744
Danny Shapiro's got strep.

89
00:05:17,811 --> 00:05:20,046
That's why I don't give out
my cell number to patients.

90
00:05:20,113 --> 00:05:21,648
(chuckles)

91
00:05:23,216 --> 00:05:25,284
BARRY: Sammy, clear your plate.

92
00:05:25,352 --> 00:05:27,353
SAMMY: Got to finish packing.

93
00:05:27,421 --> 00:05:31,090
Honey, you do realize Emma's
manifesting your negativity.

94
00:05:31,158 --> 00:05:34,160
Maybe on the plane ride, you
can think of something nice

95
00:05:34,227 --> 00:05:35,161
to tell her about your family.

96
00:05:35,228 --> 00:05:37,063
BARRY: They're not my family.
You're my family.

97
00:05:37,130 --> 00:05:39,065
No, see, this is exactly
what I'm talking about.

98
00:05:39,132 --> 00:05:40,032
Of course she's acting out.

99
00:05:40,099 --> 00:05:43,035
All she hears about is how
you don't want to go.

100
00:05:43,102 --> 00:05:44,770
BARRY (sighs): Just promise
me we'll come back.

101
00:05:44,837 --> 00:05:46,038
What?

102
00:05:48,541 --> 00:05:52,110
Very funny. (chuckles)

103
00:05:56,848 --> 00:05:59,484
SAMMY: I told you not to take
the 405-- I mean, come on, who

104
00:05:59,552 --> 00:06:00,818
takes the 405?

105
00:06:00,886 --> 00:06:04,055
All right, let's
go, let's move it.

106
00:06:05,924 --> 00:06:07,892
Come on!

107
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:09,860
(sighs)

108
00:06:14,666 --> 00:06:17,969
Great. You happy now?

109
00:06:18,036 --> 00:06:19,303
We missed our flight.

110
00:06:19,370 --> 00:06:21,138
I'm sure there's another one.

111
00:06:21,206 --> 00:06:23,107
EMMA: Or maybe it's a sign
from Allah that we should go

112
00:06:23,174 --> 00:06:26,176
to Disney World like
every other family.

113
00:06:26,244 --> 00:06:28,178
I'll call the airline. See
if there's another flight.

114
00:06:28,246 --> 00:06:31,148
- Mr. Al Fayeed?
BARRY: - Yes.

115
00:06:31,216 --> 00:06:34,184
- Are you ready to board?
- The plane's still here?

116
00:06:34,252 --> 00:06:35,319
Of course.

117
00:06:35,386 --> 00:06:37,221
BARRY: I'm sorry. Has
everyone else boarded?

118
00:06:37,288 --> 00:06:40,324
You are the only
passengers, sir.

119
00:06:40,391 --> 00:06:43,393
Your father bought all the
other seats on the plane.

120
00:06:47,531 --> 00:06:50,700
- Good morning.
SAMMY: - Good morning.

121
00:06:50,768 --> 00:06:53,436
Oh, wow.

122
00:06:53,504 --> 00:06:55,371
This is what I'm talking about.

123
00:06:55,439 --> 00:06:56,372
(woman laughs)

124
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:57,607
I think I like this.

125
00:06:57,675 --> 00:06:58,608
A whole plane?

126
00:06:58,676 --> 00:07:02,278
SAMMY: Oh, no. No, wait, wait.
All right, this one.

127
00:07:02,346 --> 00:07:03,912
Oh, man. Look at this.

128
00:07:03,980 --> 00:07:05,381
Thank you, Grandpa.

129
00:07:05,449 --> 00:07:07,483
BARRY: Okay, guys,
get up, please.

130
00:07:07,551 --> 00:07:08,951
These aren't our seats.

131
00:07:10,287 --> 00:07:12,155
SAMMY (sighs): Y-You're
kidding, right?

132
00:07:12,222 --> 00:07:13,422
BARRY: No, get up.

133
00:07:13,490 --> 00:07:15,891
We're gonna sit in the
seats that we paid for.

134
00:07:15,959 --> 00:07:19,194
(chuckles)

135
00:07:19,262 --> 00:07:20,328
Isn't this a little crazy?

136
00:07:20,396 --> 00:07:22,164
BARRY: This is what's crazy.

137
00:07:22,231 --> 00:07:24,499
I say no to his private
jet, so he does this.

138
00:07:24,567 --> 00:07:27,202
And I'm-I'm not gonna be
manipulated like that.

139
00:07:27,270 --> 00:07:29,171
No way.

140
00:07:29,238 --> 00:07:32,174
Honey, your father'll
never know.

141
00:07:34,610 --> 00:07:36,211
BARRY: Fine.

142
00:07:36,279 --> 00:07:38,146
Sit wherever you want.

143
00:07:47,323 --> 00:07:49,257
EMMA: It's okay.

144
00:07:49,325 --> 00:07:51,159
I'll go sit with Dad.

145
00:07:51,227 --> 00:07:52,593
No. Stay here.

146
00:08:10,212 --> 00:08:13,113
I'm in the window seat.

147
00:08:26,761 --> 00:08:29,295
(seatbelt clicks)

148

00:08:58,419 --> 00:09:01,288
Oh. (chuckles)

151
00:09:01,356 --> 00:09:03,624
How long have I been out?

152
00:09:03,691 --> 00:09:05,292
BARRY: Couple hours.

153
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:06,593
Mmm.

154
00:09:06,661 --> 00:09:09,463
So no turning back, huh?

155
00:09:09,530 --> 00:09:15,335
If it makes a difference, I'm
really happy we're doing this.

156
00:09:15,403 --> 00:09:19,072
BARRY: Well, I'm happy
when you're happy.

157
00:09:20,508 --> 00:09:23,277
See, I see a real
opportunity here.

158
00:09:23,344 --> 00:09:26,280
To finally sit down
with your father.

159
00:09:26,347 --> 00:09:28,114
Tell him everything you've
been carrying around

160
00:09:28,182 --> 00:09:30,250
in your head all these years.

161

00:09:32,419 --> 00:09:36,256
BARRY: Yeah, you don't
know my father.

163
00:09:36,323 --> 00:09:38,258
I know you.

164
00:09:38,325 --> 00:09:40,293
I see you're awake.

165
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:42,328
Yes. (chuckles)

166
00:09:42,396 --> 00:09:43,462
What do you have there?

167
00:09:43,530 --> 00:09:47,032
Dom Pérignon Rosé
Oenothèque 1990.

168
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:49,735
Your brother, Jamal, insisted
we have it on board for you.

169
00:09:52,372 --> 00:09:55,174
To your brother, Jamal.

170
00:09:56,710 --> 00:09:59,077
BARRY: To my brother.

171
00:09:59,145 --> 00:10:01,313
(grunting)

172
00:10:03,449 --> 00:10:05,984
(woman moaning)

173
00:10:11,590 --> 00:10:14,359
(grunting)

174
00:10:20,433 --> 00:10:21,399
(grunting)

175
00:10:21,467 --> 00:10:22,834
(phone buzzing)

176
00:10:26,104 --> 00:10:28,773
(panting)

177
00:10:28,841 --> 00:10:30,542
(groans)

178
00:10:31,517 --> 00:10:35,137
Why you didn't get me?
My wife just called.

179
00:10:35,172 --> 00:10:37,481
My brother's landing
in ten minutes.

180
00:10:42,420 --> 00:10:44,755
Go inside...

181
00:10:55,734 --> 00:10:57,835
(faucet turns, water running)

182
00:11:10,447 --> 00:11:12,382

00:11:20,457 --> 00:11:22,325

BARRY: <i>Wa alaikum as-salaam.</i>

198
00:12:05,301 --> 00:12:07,436
So good to see you, Bassam.

199
00:12:10,740 --> 00:12:12,240
So good you could all come.

200
00:12:12,308 --> 00:12:14,508
We've been looking
forward to it.

201
00:12:14,576 --> 00:12:17,678
I trust the flight
was satisfactory?

202
00:12:17,746 --> 00:12:20,448
BARRY: There was, uh,
plenty of legroom.

203
00:12:20,515 --> 00:12:21,950
Your father insisted.

204
00:12:22,017 --> 00:12:24,018
You are still an Al Fayeed.

205
00:12:24,086 --> 00:12:26,761

00:12:42,437 --> 00:12:43,637
Little brother.

211
00:12:43,705 --> 00:12:45,439
BARRY: Jamal.

212
00:12:48,343 --> 00:12:50,277
(growls)

213
00:12:52,513 --> 00:12:54,281
JAMAL: You look pale.
What's the matter?

214
00:12:54,349 --> 00:12:56,883
No sun in California? (laughs)

215
00:12:56,951 --> 00:13:01,621
When we went to Disney,
there was plenty of sun.

216
00:13:01,689 --> 00:13:02,689
Molly.

217
00:13:02,756 --> 00:13:03,690
(chuckles): Hey, Jamal.

218
00:13:03,757 --> 00:13:04,524
Miss America.

219
00:13:04,592 --> 00:13:06,258
MOLLY: Jamal.

220
00:13:06,326 --> 00:13:07,494
JAMAL: Beautiful as ever.

221
00:13:07,561 --> 00:13:08,461
MOLLY: Thank you.

222
00:13:08,529 --> 00:13:09,529
JAMAL: Emma.

223
00:13:09,597 --> 00:13:10,797
Come to your uncle.

224
00:13:10,865 --> 00:13:12,799
(laughs)

225
00:13:12,867 --> 00:13:15,502
My little mermaid.

226
00:13:15,569 --> 00:13:16,803
Sammy.

227
00:13:16,871 --> 00:13:17,971
Sammy, my fishing buddy.

228
00:13:18,038 --> 00:13:19,171
(laughs)

229
00:13:19,239 --> 00:13:20,672
SAMMY: Hey, Uncle Jamal.

230
00:13:20,740 --> 00:13:22,808
JAMAL: So tall.

231
00:13:22,876 --> 00:13:24,977
I just bought a Mikelson Nomad.

232
00:13:25,045 --> 00:13:26,479
Have you heard of this boat?

233
00:13:26,546 --> 00:13:27,213
SAMMY: No.

234
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:29,281
JAMAL: Fastest thing
you've ever seen.

235
00:13:29,349 --> 00:13:31,850
After the wedding, we'll take
her out and catch some tuna.

236
00:13:31,918 --> 00:13:33,052
SAMMY: All right.

237
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:34,720
JAMAL: Come. Let's
go to the palace.

238
00:13:49,002 --> 00:13:52,537
MOLLY: Look, Em,
there's a Subway.

239
00:13:52,604 --> 00:13:54,672
And I read they just built
a great mall downtown.

240
00:13:54,740 --> 00:13:57,275
It's really not that
different from home.

241
00:13:57,343 --> 00:13:59,310
SAMMY: Except
there's no traffic.

242
00:13:59,378 --> 00:14:02,247
EMMA: They're holding it, stupid.
Because of us.

243
00:14:07,253 --> 00:14:09,186
Sweet.

244
00:14:16,515 --> 00:14:18,617
Check out Grandpa
on the billboard.

245
00:14:22,154 --> 00:14:24,855
(Sammy chuckles)

246
00:14:24,923 --> 00:14:26,257
KHALED: You can't kill me!

247
00:14:26,325 --> 00:14:28,025
(high-pitched ringing)

248
00:14:28,094 --> 00:14:29,894
Here I am!

249
00:14:37,035 --> 00:14:39,103
I'm right here!

250
00:14:39,170 --> 00:14:41,171
You can't kill me!

251
00:15:03,694 --> 00:15:06,630
SAMMY: Holy shit.

252
00:15:06,697 --> 00:15:09,766
You grew up here?

253
00:15:11,603 --> 00:15:12,836
BARRY: Yeah.

254
00:15:12,903 --> 00:15:14,804
SAMMY: I can't believe
you'd ever leave.

255
00:15:29,453 --> 00:15:31,587
JAMAL: I was already at the
airport when you called.

256
00:15:31,656 --> 00:15:34,090
Mm-hmm.

257
00:15:36,660 --> 00:15:37,893
Hello, Bassam.

258
00:15:37,961 --> 00:15:38,794
BARRY: Leila.

259
00:15:40,197 --> 00:15:42,831
LEILA: Molly. Welcome.

260
00:15:42,899 --> 00:15:45,268
MOLLY: Congratulations
on the wedding.

261
00:15:45,335 --> 00:15:46,769
You must be so proud.

262
00:15:46,836 --> 00:15:49,004
LEILA: We are very proud, yes.

263
00:15:49,072 --> 00:15:51,640
And we're so happy you've come.

264
00:15:51,708 --> 00:15:54,677
All of you.

265
00:15:54,744 --> 00:15:56,880
Your father is waiting.

266
00:15:59,829 --> 00:16:03,018
MOLLY: We're fine.
Go ahead.

267
00:16:07,664 --> 00:16:09,999
LEILA: Who wants to
jump in the pool?

268
00:16:10,066 --> 00:16:13,369
SAMMY: I don't mind.
I-I could do that.

269
00:16:52,637 --> 00:16:55,539
KHALED: Bassam.

270
00:16:57,108 --> 00:16:59,076
BARRY: Father.

271
00:17:20,830 --> 00:17:22,631
You look well.

272
00:17:22,699 --> 00:17:24,633
KHALED: Been so long.

273
00:17:26,537 --> 00:17:29,605
Too long.

274
00:17:29,673 --> 00:17:33,709
BARRY: Well, um... between, uh,
between work and the kids' schedules,

275
00:17:33,777 --> 00:17:34,677
it's, um...

276
00:17:34,744 --> 00:17:36,244
KHALED: I'm sure.

277
00:17:36,312 --> 00:17:38,447
You're a busy man.

278
00:17:39,849 --> 00:17:45,353
Your father's been so excited
to see you, he's barely slept.

279
00:17:47,857 --> 00:17:50,158
KHALED: I need a
moment with Jamal.

280
00:17:51,194 --> 00:17:53,295
Then we'll take a walk.

281
00:17:53,362 --> 00:17:56,364
Just you and me.

282
00:18:13,181 --> 00:18:17,752
Jamal. We just heard from
our sources in Ma'an.

283
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:21,255
Terrorists are planning
to attack the wedding.

284
00:18:21,323 --> 00:18:24,191
JAMAL: I don't understand.

285
00:18:24,259 --> 00:18:28,829
I told Yussef to pay Walid
to keep them quiet.

286
00:18:28,896 --> 00:18:31,232
KHALED: Did I ask
you for excuses?

287
00:18:34,969 --> 00:18:38,239
JAMAL: I'll have Ziad round
up the troublemakers.

288
00:18:38,306 --> 00:18:39,840
KHALED: And tomorrow, 10,000

289
00:18:39,907 --> 00:18:42,943
people will be protesting
in the square.

290
00:18:43,011 --> 00:18:46,546
Don't be a fool, Jamal.

291
00:18:46,614 --> 00:18:48,815
Talk to Walid yourself.

292
00:18:48,883 --> 00:18:51,785
Make sure he understands
there will be consequences

293
00:18:51,853 --> 00:18:54,721
if he can't control
his own people.

294
00:18:57,025 --> 00:18:58,924
And bring your brother.

295
00:19:01,962 --> 00:19:03,296
JAMAL: Why?

296
00:19:03,364 --> 00:19:05,465
KHALED: Because I told you to.

297
00:19:10,237 --> 00:19:12,938
I wish you'd reconsider.

298
00:19:13,006 --> 00:19:17,910
You're... You're here
for such a short time.

299
00:19:17,978 --> 00:19:21,080
It seems silly for you to
be staying in a hotel.

300
00:19:21,148 --> 00:19:23,916
BARRY: Well, we, uh, we already made the...
the reservations, so...

301
00:19:23,984 --> 00:19:25,284
Cancel them.

302
00:19:25,351 --> 00:19:31,590
BARRY: Mother, please, you... You
asked me to come here and I'm here.

303
00:19:36,262 --> 00:19:39,798
He's changed, Bassam.

304
00:19:39,865 --> 00:19:45,337
As hard as that may be for
you to accept, it's true.

305
00:19:50,743 --> 00:19:55,714
KHALED: How does it feel, being,
uh, home after all these years?

306
00:19:59,752 --> 00:20:03,487
BARRY: Coming through the city,
I barely recognized the place.

307
00:20:03,555 --> 00:20:06,056
Everything's changed.

308
00:20:06,124 --> 00:20:08,959
KHALED: Yes, it has.

309
00:20:09,027 --> 00:20:11,362
Saddam and Gaddafi are dead.

310
00:20:11,430 --> 00:20:13,163
Mubarak is on trial.

311
00:20:13,232 --> 00:20:15,666
Ben Ali, in exile.

312
00:20:15,734 --> 00:20:18,636
BARRY: You're still here.

313
00:20:18,704 --> 00:20:22,539
KHALED: For now. Inshallah.

314
00:20:22,607 --> 00:20:29,279
After everything I've given the
people, they're still not satisfied.

315
00:20:29,347 --> 00:20:31,882
They say they want freedom.

316
00:20:33,885 --> 00:20:35,853
Freedom.

317
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:37,721
To do what?

318
00:20:37,788 --> 00:20:39,956
Kill each other?

319
00:20:43,227 --> 00:20:51,334
I give them order and prosperity,
and all they want is chaos.

320
00:20:55,105 --> 00:21:02,078
BARRY: Listen, um... Molly and the
kids are still waiting for me.

321
00:21:02,146 --> 00:21:05,114
We need to check into the hotel.

322
00:21:05,182 --> 00:21:08,184
KHALED: Of course.

323
00:21:08,252 --> 00:21:12,388
You didn't come all this way
to hear an old man complain.

324
00:21:19,061 --> 00:21:23,999
It's good to have you
home again, Bassam.

325
00:21:24,066 --> 00:21:28,170
We've been living here for five
years, and as far as we're concerned,

326
00:21:28,237 --> 00:21:29,905
it's paradise, right, baby?

327
00:21:29,972 --> 00:21:31,006
Mm-hmm.

328
00:21:31,073 --> 00:21:33,108
Beaches? Best in the world.

329
00:21:33,176 --> 00:21:37,378
Horses? They've got a racetrack
that blows away Churchill Downs.

330
00:21:37,446 --> 00:21:39,414
We could make a day of it.

331
00:21:39,481 --> 00:21:41,216
MOLLY: Hey, how was it?

332
00:21:41,284 --> 00:21:44,452
BARRY: Uh, it was good.

333
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:45,553
John Tucker.

334
00:21:45,621 --> 00:21:47,054
I'm with the embassy.

335
00:21:47,122 --> 00:21:48,423
Nice to finally meet you.

336
00:21:48,490 --> 00:21:49,657
BARRY: Finally?

337
00:21:49,725 --> 00:21:53,060
JOHN: Your father talks
about you all the time.

338
00:21:53,128 --> 00:21:54,429
I'm Dana.

339
00:21:54,496 --> 00:21:55,363
I'm with him.

340
00:21:55,431 --> 00:21:57,198
BARRY: - Hi.
DANA: - Hi.

341
00:21:57,265 --> 00:21:59,066
BARRY: Uh, we should
get to the hotel.

342
00:21:59,134 --> 00:22:01,068
MOLLY: Oh, sure. Okay.

343
00:22:01,136 --> 00:22:03,503
See you at the wedding, right?

344
00:22:05,941 --> 00:22:08,242
BARRY: Hey, guys, time to go.

345
00:22:08,310 --> 00:22:09,476
Sammy, out of the pool, please.

346
00:22:09,544 --> 00:22:11,445
JOHN: They're
staying at a hotel?

347
00:22:11,512 --> 00:22:12,579
SAMMY: I just got in!

348
00:22:12,647 --> 00:22:13,547
LEILA: It's complicated.

349
00:22:13,614 --> 00:22:15,949
MOLLY: So how was it
to see your father?

350
00:22:16,016 --> 00:22:17,384
BARRY: I told you.
It was good.

351
00:22:17,452 --> 00:22:19,018
MOLLY: It was good?

352
00:22:19,086 --> 00:22:20,954
BARRY: Yeah, we, um...
we went for a walk.

353
00:22:21,021 --> 00:22:22,121
MOLLY: And?

354
00:22:22,189 --> 00:22:25,258
BARRY: He got old. I'm not sure
what else you want me to say.

355
00:22:25,326 --> 00:22:29,028
Sammy, get out of the pool.

356
00:22:29,096 --> 00:22:32,065
MOLLY: Sammy, you heard your father.
Let's go.

357
00:22:35,135 --> 00:22:41,007
SAMMY: Oh. Well, this is... this
is so much better than the palace.

358
00:22:41,075 --> 00:22:43,642
Look, a minibar.

359
00:22:43,710 --> 00:22:48,346
EMMA: You know, I don't really want to go
to this thing tonight. I'm kind of tired.

360
00:22:48,381 --> 00:22:50,916
MOLLY: Aw, come on, Emma. It'll be fun.
We'll get our hands and feet painted.

361
00:22:50,984 --> 00:22:52,685
You always say you
want a tattoo.

362
00:22:52,753 --> 00:22:55,688
EMMA: Yeah, on my own terms,
not as some creepy patriarchal tradition.

363
00:22:55,756 --> 00:22:57,322
MOLLY: Okay, it's a
bachelorette party.

364
00:22:57,391 --> 00:22:59,157
There's nothing
patriarchal about it.

365
00:22:59,725 --> 00:23:01,593
If you're gonna be unbearable,
at least be accurate.

366
00:23:01,660 --> 00:23:04,629
SAMMY: Does that mean our
thing is the bachelor party?

367
00:23:04,697 --> 00:23:05,963
BARRY: Yeah.

368
00:23:06,031 --> 00:23:07,965
Without the strippers
and the booze.

369
00:23:08,033 --> 00:23:11,135
It's, uh... it's pretty much a
bunch of guys in a steam room

370
00:23:11,203 --> 00:23:12,804
watching the groom get shaved.

371
00:23:12,872 --> 00:23:14,038
Tip the bellboy when he comes.

372
00:23:14,106 --> 00:23:16,641
MOLLY: I'll see you
in the lobby at 6:00.

373
00:23:16,709 --> 00:23:19,076
EMMA: Hating.

374
00:23:23,282 --> 00:23:25,950
SAMMY: Bunch of guys
in a steam room.

375
00:23:26,018 --> 00:23:28,619
Bummer.

376
00:23:28,686 --> 00:23:30,621
EMMA: You better be careful.

377
00:23:30,688 --> 00:23:31,923
This isn't America.

378
00:23:31,990 --> 00:23:34,591
SAMMY: Thanks, Mom.

379
00:23:40,698 --> 00:23:43,066
(indistinct chatter)

380
00:23:46,938 --> 00:23:48,539
See?

381
00:23:48,606 --> 00:23:50,006
It's pretty.

382
00:23:50,074 --> 00:23:53,209
(speaking Arabic)

383
00:23:53,277 --> 00:23:55,245
She says it's your turn.

384
00:23:55,313 --> 00:23:57,414
EMMA: Oh, that's okay.
I'm good.

385
00:23:57,481 --> 00:24:01,017
Go ahead. It doesn't hurt.

386
00:24:07,158 --> 00:24:11,861
LEILA: So tell me, how did you
finally convince Bassam to come?

387
00:24:11,929 --> 00:24:15,998
MOLLY: I told him it's crazy,
we've been married for 19 years

388
00:24:16,066 --> 00:24:18,133
and I've never seen
where he's from.

389
00:24:18,201 --> 00:24:21,103
He doesn't like to talk
about his childhood much.

390
00:24:21,171 --> 00:24:26,141
(sighs) I thought by
coming here, maybe...

391
00:24:26,209 --> 00:24:30,545
LEILA: Bassam has always
been a very private person.

392
00:24:32,949 --> 00:24:35,284
(laughter)

393
00:24:35,352 --> 00:24:38,653
JAMAL: Remember, Sammy, the whole
time we were catching fish

394
00:24:38,721 --> 00:24:41,991
and your father was standing
over the railing and...

395
00:24:42,058 --> 00:24:43,892
(mimics retching)

396
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:45,326
(laughter)

397
00:24:46,562 --> 00:24:48,763
Like it?

398
00:24:48,831 --> 00:24:51,065
Good, huh?

399
00:24:55,004 --> 00:24:58,106
Bassam, come with me.

400
00:25:16,325 --> 00:25:17,758
BARRY: Where are we going?

401
00:25:17,826 --> 00:25:20,127
JAMAL: To talk to a
tribal leader from Ma'an,

402
00:25:20,194 --> 00:25:22,396
which is still the
asshole of the country.

403
00:25:22,463 --> 00:25:24,965
Yussef paid him to keep things
quiet during the wedding,

404
00:25:25,033 --> 00:25:26,033
but it didn't work.

405
00:25:26,100 --> 00:25:28,268
And now I have to handle it.

406
00:25:28,336 --> 00:25:31,238
BARRY: What do you
mean it didn't work?

407
00:25:31,305 --> 00:25:33,741
JAMAL: Walid's terrorist nephew,
Ihab, he's been causing

408
00:25:33,808 --> 00:25:38,645
trouble ever since he
came back from Syria.

409
00:25:38,712 --> 00:25:41,748
Now he's threatening to
blow up the wedding.

410
00:25:41,815 --> 00:25:45,752
Blow up the wedding? Jamal, I
brought my whole family here.

411
00:25:45,819 --> 00:25:46,753
JAMAL: No worries, Bassam.

412
00:25:46,820 --> 00:25:47,754
I'll handle it.

413
00:25:47,821 --> 00:25:50,723
My friend, the minute I
heard you wanted to see me,

414
00:25:50,791 --> 00:25:52,391
I dropped everything
and came here.

415
00:25:52,459 --> 00:25:55,895
JAMAL: You didn't come,
Walid, my men brought you.

416
00:25:55,963 --> 00:25:57,931
WALID: And here I am.
(chuckles)

417
00:25:57,998 --> 00:26:00,767
JAMAL: My father is troubled
by what he's been hearing

418
00:26:00,834 --> 00:26:03,369
about your terrorist
nephew, Ihab.

419
00:26:03,437 --> 00:26:06,005
WALID: People are always
spreading rumors about Ihab.

420
00:26:06,073 --> 00:26:11,777
JAMAL: So he has no plans to
blow up my son's wedding?

421
00:26:14,548 --> 00:26:16,815
WALID: N-Not that I've heard.

422
00:26:16,883 --> 00:26:20,286
JAMAL: But you don't
know for sure.

423
00:26:20,353 --> 00:26:22,455
WALID: Well, look, it's true
that Ihab doesn't share my

424
00:26:22,522 --> 00:26:25,924
- goodwill for your son's wedding...
JAMAL: - I pay you to control him.

425
00:26:25,992 --> 00:26:27,859
WALID: I can only
do what I can do.

426
00:26:27,927 --> 00:26:29,962
- I-I tried talking to him...
JAMAL: - Not hard enough.

427
00:26:30,029 --> 00:26:31,597
WALID: No! (grunts)

428
00:26:31,664 --> 00:26:33,465
(Walid shouting)

429
00:26:42,841 --> 00:26:46,211
(crying, shouting)

430
00:26:47,079 --> 00:26:48,480
Jamal! Please!

431
00:26:48,547 --> 00:26:52,046
JAMAL: You think you can take our money?
Well, you...

432
00:26:52,108 --> 00:26:53,214
BARRY: Jamal.

433
00:26:53,249 --> 00:26:55,320
JAMAL: I'll take your
fingers one at a time.

434
00:26:55,387 --> 00:26:56,988
(muffled shouting)

435
00:26:57,055 --> 00:26:57,822
BARRY: Jamal! Stop!

436
00:26:57,889 --> 00:26:58,990
Stop! Stop it!

437
00:26:59,057 --> 00:27:00,825
(screams)

438
00:27:00,892 --> 00:27:01,859
JAMAL: Get off!

439
00:27:01,927 --> 00:27:02,893
BARRY: Listen to me!

440
00:27:02,961 --> 00:27:05,997
You're giving him more reason
to attack than he already has.

441
00:27:06,064 --> 00:27:08,032
JAMAL: You don't
understand, Bassam.

442
00:27:08,100 --> 00:27:11,468
You've been gone too long.

443
00:27:11,536 --> 00:27:14,838
This asshole and his nephew need
to learn there are consequences.

444
00:27:14,905 --> 00:27:16,873
BARRY: Okay, but not like this.

445
00:27:16,941 --> 00:27:18,242
JAMAL: Then how? Tell me.

446
00:27:18,309 --> 00:27:19,109
I'm listening.

447
00:27:19,177 --> 00:27:21,011
(panting)

448
00:27:21,078 --> 00:27:22,879
(crying)

449
00:27:22,947 --> 00:27:25,815
BARRY (panting): Talk to him.

450
00:27:25,883 --> 00:27:27,251
JAMAL: Talk to him?

451
00:27:27,318 --> 00:27:28,785
You mean like Oprah.

452
00:27:28,853 --> 00:27:30,120
"How do you feel, Walid?

453
00:27:30,187 --> 00:27:31,454
You had a bad childhood?

454
00:27:31,522 --> 00:27:33,123
Oh, me, too. Let's hug it out."

455
00:27:33,190 --> 00:27:36,126
BARRY: - No, that's not what I mean.
JAMAL: - Then what do you mean?

456
00:27:36,193 --> 00:27:37,927
BARRY: Invite him
to the wedding.

457
00:27:37,995 --> 00:27:40,363
Him and his nephew, Ihab.

458
00:27:40,430 --> 00:27:44,067
Invite his whole family and put one
of them at every single table.

459
00:27:44,135 --> 00:27:46,769
He'll find a way to make
sure no one attacks.

460
00:28:09,192 --> 00:28:15,397
JAMAL: My brother Bassam would
like you and your family

461
00:28:15,464 --> 00:28:19,301
to come to the wedding
as his honored guests.

462
00:29:05,972 --> 00:29:08,306
(call to prayer in distance)

463
00:29:38,003 --> 00:29:40,471
(indistinct chatter)

464
00:30:02,794 --> 00:30:05,261
(praying)

465
00:30:33,223 --> 00:30:35,157
FAUZI (quietly): Bassam.

466
00:30:35,225 --> 00:30:38,260
What the hell are
you doing here?

467
00:30:46,202 --> 00:30:48,337
BARRY: She's beautiful.

468
00:30:48,404 --> 00:30:50,805
Looks just like her mom.

469
00:30:50,873 --> 00:30:52,941
FAUZI: Thank you.

470
00:30:53,009 --> 00:30:55,511
She's very intelligent.

471
00:30:58,515 --> 00:31:02,584
BARRY (sighs): So how come
you never called me back?

472
00:31:04,454 --> 00:31:08,322
FAUZI: Do you have any idea
what's happening here, Bassam?

473
00:31:08,390 --> 00:31:11,893
BARRY: I read what you write,
if that's what you're asking.

474
00:31:13,262 --> 00:31:16,230
FAUZI: After the protests
started last year,

475
00:31:16,298 --> 00:31:19,233
your father sent his
tanks into Ma'an.

476
00:31:19,301 --> 00:31:22,069
Dozens of people were
killed, hundreds wounded.

477
00:31:22,137 --> 00:31:26,269
All the international web sites
and papers carried my articles,

478
00:31:26,304 --> 00:31:28,311
yet I never heard
anything from you.

479

And if you think that hasn't
affected your relationship

642
00:42:11,199 --> 00:42:13,500
with Emma and Sammy...

643
00:42:13,568 --> 00:42:15,502
with me...

644
00:42:16,770 --> 00:42:19,139
(footsteps approach)

645
00:42:19,207 --> 00:42:20,340
YUSSEF: Bassam.

646
00:42:21,275 --> 00:42:24,077
It's your father.

647
00:42:24,145 --> 00:42:25,745
He's collapsed.

648
00:42:38,401 --> 00:42:45,407
I am afraid the president has
suffered a cerebrovascular injury.

649
00:42:45,475 --> 00:42:47,409
JAMAL: What does that mean?

650
00:42:47,477 --> 00:42:49,010
BARRY: It means a stroke.

651
00:42:49,078 --> 00:42:50,546
Yes.

652
00:42:50,613 --> 00:42:52,448
JAMAL: He'll be fine.

653
00:42:52,515 --> 00:42:54,717
We are doing everything we can.

654
00:42:54,784 --> 00:42:57,786
JAMAL: If he dies, you die.

655
00:42:57,854 --> 00:43:00,823
You are a doctor; you fix him.

656
00:43:05,962 --> 00:43:08,096
Your father asked to see you.

657
00:43:20,542 --> 00:43:24,612
KHALED: My son will
cut the ribbon.

658
00:43:29,551 --> 00:43:30,718
I'm right here!

659
00:43:30,786 --> 00:43:32,953
You can't kill me!

660
00:43:38,126 --> 00:43:39,193
Bassam...

661
00:43:45,600 --> 00:43:47,034
Bassam...

662
00:43:48,569 --> 00:43:51,338
BARRY: It's okay.

663
00:43:51,406 --> 00:43:52,606
Don't try to talk.

664
00:43:52,673 --> 00:43:55,041
KHALED: Listen to me.

665
00:43:55,109 --> 00:44:01,381
Without you, they'll
kill us all.

666
00:44:07,789 --> 00:44:09,923
I was wrong.

667
00:44:14,594 --> 00:44:16,930
It should have been you.

668
00:44:22,102 --> 00:44:25,070
It should have been you, Bassam.

669
00:44:40,554 --> 00:44:41,519
JAMAL: How is he?

670
00:44:41,587 --> 00:44:42,720
What did he say?

671
00:44:42,788 --> 00:44:47,259
BARRY: He wants to talk to you.
You and Mother.

672
00:44:56,669 --> 00:44:58,770
MOLLY: You okay?

673
00:45:02,641 --> 00:45:04,809
Barry?

674
00:45:04,877 --> 00:45:08,513
BARRY: You should
check on the kids.

675
00:45:08,581 --> 00:45:10,682
MOLLY: Okay.

676
00:45:26,598 --> 00:45:28,732
(sniffles)

677
00:45:31,669 --> 00:45:33,770
(exhales)

678
00:45:37,609 --> 00:45:39,109
JAMAL: He's gone.

679
00:45:43,114 --> 00:45:44,848
He's gone.

680
00:45:44,916 --> 00:45:46,216
LEILA: Jamal.

681
00:45:46,283 --> 00:45:47,550
Jamal, come...

682
00:45:47,618 --> 00:45:48,951
Where are you going?

683
00:45:49,020 --> 00:45:52,288
Look at me. Look at me.

684
00:45:52,356 --> 00:45:54,657
Now you are in charge.

685
00:45:54,725 --> 00:45:56,526
Okay?

686
00:45:56,593 --> 00:45:59,629
Now it's your time.

687
00:45:59,696 --> 00:46:01,797
You need to be a man.

688
00:46:01,865 --> 00:46:02,999
(sniffles, short laugh)

689
00:46:03,067 --> 00:46:05,067
JAMAL: You're telling
me to be a man?

690
00:46:05,135 --> 00:46:08,237
When was the last time
you were a woman to me?

691
00:46:08,304 --> 00:46:10,339
LEILA: Oh!

692
00:46:10,407 --> 00:46:11,340
Stop it.

693
00:46:11,408 --> 00:46:12,608
JAMAL: You hate me.

694
00:46:12,676 --> 00:46:13,843
I know that.

695
00:46:13,911 --> 00:46:15,344
I love you.

696
00:46:15,412 --> 00:46:16,378
And you hate me.

697
00:46:16,446 --> 00:46:18,648
LEILA: This is... Aah. Jamal.

698
00:46:18,715 --> 00:46:20,782
BARRY: Jamal.

699
00:46:20,850 --> 00:46:22,984
LEILA: Jamal!

700
00:46:38,868 --> 00:46:42,403
President Khaled Al Fayeed's condition
is still unknown at this time.

701
00:46:42,471 --> 00:46:44,606
No official word from the
presidential palace.

702
00:46:44,674 --> 00:46:47,241
The president collapsed at his
grandson's wedding celebration

703
00:46:47,309 --> 00:46:49,343
five hours ago.

704
00:46:49,411 --> 00:46:51,546
BARRY: He's dead.

705
00:46:51,614 --> 00:46:54,815
MOLLY: I'm so sorry.

706
00:47:03,892 --> 00:47:05,393
BARRY: Come on. Let's go.

707
00:47:05,461 --> 00:47:07,528
MOLLY: Okay.
Back to the hotel?

708
00:47:07,596 --> 00:47:10,650
BARRY: - To the airport.
MOLLY: - What...?

709
00:47:10,685 --> 00:47:12,432
BARRY: - We're leaving.
MOLLY: - What are you talking about?

710
00:47:12,500 --> 00:47:13,400
BARRY: We're going home.

711
00:47:13,468 --> 00:47:14,367
MOLLY: Barry.

712
00:47:14,435 --> 00:47:16,622
- We can't just leave.
BARRY: - Come on. Get up.

713
00:47:16,657 --> 00:47:18,334
MOLLY: Honey, we don't
have our passports.

714
00:47:18,369 --> 00:47:19,473
BARRY: That's fine.
We'll stop at the hotel.

715
00:47:19,840 --> 00:47:22,309
Get up, Sammy. Now.

716
00:47:22,377 --> 00:47:26,213
SAMMY: So, what, we're not even
staying for Grandpa's funeral?

717
00:47:26,281 --> 00:47:29,305
BARRY: Sammy, for once,
you do what I tell you.

718
00:47:29,340 --> 00:47:30,568
SAMMY: I want to
see Uncle Jamal.

719
00:47:30,603 --> 00:47:31,751
BARRY: No, I said
we're going now.

720
00:47:31,819 --> 00:47:32,786
EMMA: Sammy, listen to Dad.

721
00:47:32,853 --> 00:47:34,921
SAMMY: I'm not leaving here
until I see Uncle Jamal.

722
00:47:34,988 --> 00:47:35,922
BARRY: Forget Uncle Jamal.

723
00:47:35,989 --> 00:47:37,023
SAMMY: No.

724
00:47:37,090 --> 00:47:38,491
I'm staying here.

725
00:47:47,935 --> 00:47:49,168
BARRY: Now.

726
00:47:57,377 --> 00:47:59,677
MOLLY: What is the
matter with you?

727
00:48:16,176 --> 00:48:18,810
(engine revving)

728
00:48:24,151 --> 00:48:26,252
(phone buzzing)

729
00:48:28,220 --> 00:48:30,321
JAMAL: Meet me downstairs.

730
00:48:55,814 --> 00:48:58,616
BARRY: I need four seats on the
next flight to Los Angeles.

731
00:48:58,684 --> 00:49:00,051
In coach, please.

732
00:49:00,119 --> 00:49:01,052
Any airline?

733
00:49:01,119 --> 00:49:02,152
BARRY: Yeah.

734
00:49:02,220 --> 00:49:04,722
Passports. Come on.
(snaps fingers)

735
00:49:30,814 --> 00:49:32,748
(tires screeching)

736
00:49:38,422 --> 00:49:43,191
JAMAL: What are you looking at?

737
00:49:43,259 --> 00:49:45,728
You want to look at something?

738
00:49:45,795 --> 00:49:46,962
Look at this.

739
00:49:47,030 --> 00:49:49,297
Look at this. Come on.

740
00:49:49,365 --> 00:49:50,499
(muffled grunt)

741
00:49:50,566 --> 00:49:51,600
Yeah.

742
00:49:51,668 --> 00:49:53,335
Mmm.

743
00:49:55,471 --> 00:49:56,171
Yeah.

744
00:49:56,239 --> 00:49:57,772
(coughs)

745
00:49:57,840 --> 00:50:00,275
Good girl.

746
00:50:02,345 --> 00:50:04,312
(tires screech)

747
00:50:07,750 --> 00:50:08,816
That's good.

748
00:50:08,884 --> 00:50:10,885
(grunting)

749
00:50:10,953 --> 00:50:12,354
Oh, yeah.

750
00:50:14,023 --> 00:50:14,922
What is this?

751
00:50:14,990 --> 00:50:15,990
(grunting)

752
00:50:16,058 --> 00:50:17,025
Aah!

753
00:50:17,092 --> 00:50:19,127
(tires screech)

754
00:50:19,194 --> 00:50:21,963
(screaming)

755
00:50:22,031 --> 00:50:23,965
(glass shattering)

756
00:50:36,244 --> 00:50:38,345
(seagulls crying)

757
00:50:56,430 --> 00:50:59,365
And once we've reached an
altitude of 10,000 feet,

758
00:50:59,433 --> 00:51:03,002
you'll be able to use all
approved electronic devices.

759
00:51:11,579 --> 00:51:14,747
MOLLY: Okay, we're on the plane.

760
00:51:14,815 --> 00:51:16,816
We're going home.

761
00:51:16,883 --> 00:51:21,120
Are you ready to explain
to me what that was about?

762
00:51:21,188 --> 00:51:24,127
- Barry.
BARRY: - Not now.

763
00:51:24,162 --> 00:51:26,125
MOLLY: Oh, what do
you mean, not now?

764
00:51:26,193 --> 00:51:29,028
You leave without saying
good-bye to your family

765
00:51:29,096 --> 00:51:32,331
- after your father dies. I'm...
BARRY: - They're not my family.

766
00:51:32,398 --> 00:51:35,334
MOLLY: You hit our son.

767
00:51:35,401 --> 00:51:37,336
BARRY: Molly, not now.

768
00:51:37,403 --> 00:51:40,939
MOLLY: No. I'm sick of it.

769
00:51:41,006 --> 00:51:43,342
I never know what
you're thinking.

770
00:51:43,409 --> 00:51:45,677
I never know how you feel
because you never tell me.

771
00:51:47,146 --> 00:51:49,180
We've been married for 19 years.

772
00:51:49,249 --> 00:51:51,916
And you force me to be like
some kind of a mind reader.

773
00:51:51,984 --> 00:51:55,053
Please, look at me.

774
00:51:55,121 --> 00:51:59,057
I feel like I don't know
who you are anymore.

775
00:51:59,125 --> 00:52:00,691
I'm not sure I ever did.

776
00:52:02,828 --> 00:52:03,895
(gunshot)

777
00:52:04,363 --> 00:52:05,329
Please.

778
00:52:05,397 --> 00:52:06,130
KHALED: Do it.

779
00:52:06,198 --> 00:52:06,830
Please.

780
00:52:06,898 --> 00:52:07,798
KHALED: Shoot him.

781
00:52:07,866 --> 00:52:11,001
I have a family,
please, no, please.

782
00:52:11,069 --> 00:52:12,770
KHALED: Do it, Jamal.

783
00:52:12,837 --> 00:52:13,804
Please, no.

784
00:52:13,872 --> 00:52:17,207
(trickling)

785
00:52:17,275 --> 00:52:18,542
KHALED: Jamal.

786
00:52:18,609 --> 00:52:20,778
Jamal!

787
00:52:20,845 --> 00:52:22,980
(distant gunshots)

788
00:52:24,883 --> 00:52:26,416
Come back here.

789
00:52:29,453 --> 00:52:31,721
Jamal.

790
00:52:31,789 --> 00:52:34,558
Get out right now.

791
00:52:34,625 --> 00:52:36,159
(distant booming)

792
00:52:36,227 --> 00:52:38,261
Get out.

793
00:52:39,730 --> 00:52:42,965
(man sobbing quietly)

794
00:52:53,711 --> 00:52:57,546
Right now-- get out of the car.

795
00:52:57,614 --> 00:53:00,816
- Jamal, do as I say.
- No, please, please.

796
00:53:00,883 --> 00:53:02,818
KHALED: Get out of
the car, Jamal.

797
00:53:02,885 --> 00:53:05,554
Out of the car!

798
00:53:05,622 --> 00:53:06,388
Get out, Jamal!

799
00:53:06,456 --> 00:53:07,423
No, no, no.

800
00:53:07,490 --> 00:53:12,060
(gunshot)
Oh!

801
00:53:12,128 --> 00:53:13,995
(gunshot)

802
00:53:14,063 --> 00:53:17,899
(plane engine starting up)

803
00:53:17,967 --> 00:53:22,037
KHALED: It should have
been you, Bassam.

804
00:53:24,673 --> 00:53:26,842
MOLLY: I mean it, Barry.

805
00:53:26,909 --> 00:53:29,477
I can't do this anymore.

806
00:53:29,545 --> 00:53:35,182
If you don't tell me what's going

00:53:45,989 --> 00:53:48,382
to sit tight for a few minutes.
