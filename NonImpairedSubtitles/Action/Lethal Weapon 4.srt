1
00:00:30,976 --> 00:00:33,274
Riggs, you sure we're on
the right street?

2
00:00:34,146 --> 00:00:35,374
We must be getting warm.

3
00:00:36,315 --> 00:00:39,148
-You see anything?
-Where? l don't see anything.

4
00:00:39,418 --> 00:00:40,715
This must be the place.

5
00:00:40,986 --> 00:00:42,283
Holy shit!

6
00:00:43,689 --> 00:00:45,088
What the hell is that?

7
00:00:49,294 --> 00:00:50,283
Shit.

8
00:00:50,762 --> 00:00:51,729
Who's this joker?

9
00:00:51,997 --> 00:00:54,124
l don't know.
A spokesman for the NRA?

10
00:00:55,300 --> 00:00:56,289
Regular asshole.

11
00:00:56,768 --> 00:00:57,700
What do we do now?

12
00:00:58,837 --> 00:00:59,701
Run him over.

13
00:00:59,905 --> 00:01:02,237
What if he shoots us with
that assault rifle?

14
00:01:02,507 --> 00:01:04,236
He hasn't yet. Maybe he won't.

15
00:01:04,509 --> 00:01:05,567
What if he does?

16
00:01:05,844 --> 00:01:08,779
Don't be a Don't-Bee.
Be a Do-Bee. Be positive.

17
00:01:09,047 --> 00:01:09,979
Positive?

18
00:01:11,049 --> 00:01:13,574
-Let's run him over.
-Glad you see things my way.

19
00:01:13,852 --> 00:01:15,012
l hope he doesn't turn.

20
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:18,312
He won't. We'll creep up on him
so he won't notice.

21
00:01:18,624 --> 00:01:19,591
We'll creep?

22
00:01:19,858 --> 00:01:21,348
Will him not to turn.

23
00:01:21,627 --> 00:01:23,254
Power of positive thinking.

24
00:01:23,528 --> 00:01:25,120
Don't turn.
Will him with me.

25
00:01:25,397 --> 00:01:27,262
-Will him?!
-Don't turn around.

26
00:01:27,532 --> 00:01:29,625
-l need you, man.
-Don't turn around!

27
00:01:29,935 --> 00:01:31,630
That's it. Believe!

28
00:01:31,937 --> 00:01:32,869
Don't turn around!

29
00:01:33,138 --> 00:01:35,072
We're better than him. We're better!

30
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:36,329
We're better!

31
00:01:37,409 --> 00:01:38,740
-Don't turn!
-He's turning.

32
00:01:52,424 --> 00:01:54,221
-They just bounce off him!
-l saw!

33
00:01:54,493 --> 00:01:55,858
We're in trouble, man.

34
00:01:56,762 --> 00:02:00,163
Shit! l'll draw his fire!
You run for cover!

35
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:02,959
No, l'll draw his fire!
You run for cover!

36
00:02:03,201 --> 00:02:06,830
Are you out of your mind?! You got
a wife, kids. l got less to lose!

37
00:02:11,910 --> 00:02:13,070
Go! Get out of here!

38
00:02:17,049 --> 00:02:20,780
l wasn't supposed to tell you, but
Lorna's pregnant. You'll be a father!

39
00:02:22,788 --> 00:02:24,016
What'd you say?

40
00:02:24,289 --> 00:02:25,381
You'll be a father!

41
00:02:31,296 --> 00:02:34,788
She was afraid to tell you.
She was afraid you'd get angry.

42
00:02:35,033 --> 00:02:36,660
You never talked about children?

43
00:02:37,102 --> 00:02:38,660
-Shit!
-A baby.

44
00:02:47,479 --> 00:02:50,414
There's something l'm not
supposed to tell you too.

45
00:02:50,649 --> 00:02:54,050
Rianne's pregnant. You're going
to be a grandfather.

46
00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:55,308
Rianne's what?!

47
00:03:01,026 --> 00:03:03,358
Rianne can't be pregnant.

48
00:03:04,429 --> 00:03:05,521
She's not married.

49
00:03:05,831 --> 00:03:08,231
l don't think she intended
to get that way.

50
00:03:20,445 --> 00:03:22,709
They asking me to be a granddaddy?

51
00:03:51,610 --> 00:03:53,737
Here's what we'll do.
Take your clothes off!

52
00:03:54,079 --> 00:03:54,943
What the hell for?

53
00:03:56,114 --> 00:03:57,274
Okay, you run.

54
00:03:57,516 --> 00:04:01,748
Flame-O turns, sees you in your undies.
lt distracts him. That's when l shoot.

55
00:04:02,020 --> 00:04:04,284
-Shoot what?
-The valve on that napalm tank!

56
00:04:04,556 --> 00:04:06,023
Before he shoots me?

57
00:04:06,291 --> 00:04:07,883
-Maybe.
-Maybe?

58
00:04:18,370 --> 00:04:19,302
ls he black?

59
00:04:19,638 --> 00:04:21,538
Too much armor on.
l can't tell!

60
00:04:21,807 --> 00:04:24,742
No! Not him! The father of the baby!

61
00:04:26,411 --> 00:04:28,174
Please let him be black!

62
00:04:34,719 --> 00:04:36,209
Get going! Here he comes!

63
00:04:37,389 --> 00:04:38,583
Are those little hearts?

64
00:04:38,857 --> 00:04:41,121
Not now, Riggs.
Just hit the damn valve!

65
00:04:41,326 --> 00:04:43,760
Also, flap and make noises
like a bird!

66
00:04:44,029 --> 00:04:45,792
Flap my arms? Why?

67
00:04:46,064 --> 00:04:48,259
lt'll distract him more!
l need him to turn!

68
00:04:49,434 --> 00:04:51,959
-On 2! Ready?
-On 2? We always go on 3!

69
00:04:52,237 --> 00:04:53,727
No time for 3! Go! 2!

70
00:04:54,005 --> 00:04:56,132
-What about 1 ?
-All right. 1 , 2, go!

71
00:04:56,408 --> 00:04:58,342
l don't want to die in my underwear!

72
00:05:00,245 --> 00:05:02,372
Why are you waiting?
Shoot the bastard!

73
00:05:38,416 --> 00:05:42,250
Riggs, you think that bird thing helped?
You think it helped?

74
00:05:42,621 --> 00:05:45,385
l just wanted to see if you'd do it.

75
00:05:48,059 --> 00:05:49,321
Cute shorts.

76
00:05:52,330 --> 00:05:53,661
Go spit, Riggs!

77
00:05:55,300 --> 00:05:56,699
l'll buy you a doughnut.

78
00:05:57,002 --> 00:05:59,197
Don't put your arms around me
when l'm naked.

79
00:05:59,471 --> 00:06:00,995
You're ashamed of your butt?

80
00:06:10,415 --> 00:06:11,609
He's a lively one.

81
00:06:15,153 --> 00:06:17,815
That shark damages my boat,
l take it out on you, Leo.

82
00:06:18,089 --> 00:06:20,819
-l didn't mean to catch it.
-Why do you want to keep it?

83
00:06:21,092 --> 00:06:22,889
Yeah, why you want to keep a shark?

84
00:06:23,161 --> 00:06:26,562
-The teeth'll look great on a wall.
-They got to stop snapping first.

85
00:06:26,831 --> 00:06:28,321
Maybe he'll fall asleep.

86
00:06:28,633 --> 00:06:30,498
Engage him in conversation.
He'll nod off.

87
00:06:30,769 --> 00:06:34,034
-He don't look tired.
-Maybe chewing on Leo will wear him out.

88
00:06:34,272 --> 00:06:36,536
You think sharks eat their own kind?

89
00:06:38,643 --> 00:06:40,372
Stop! You guys got me in stitches!

90
00:06:42,347 --> 00:06:43,905
Okay, where's my bag?

91
00:06:44,182 --> 00:06:45,342
Starboard side aft.

92
00:06:45,951 --> 00:06:47,578
Starboard, that's left, right?

93
00:06:47,852 --> 00:06:50,719
-No, port's left. Starboard's right.
-Yeah, right.

94
00:06:51,523 --> 00:06:54,583
Right, yeah. Right side aft.
Got it. Okay.

95
00:06:54,859 --> 00:06:56,952
-Whatever.
-Check both sides, you'll find it.

96
00:06:57,295 --> 00:06:58,193
Careful!

97
00:06:58,463 --> 00:06:59,395
Behind you, shark!

98
00:07:02,367 --> 00:07:03,959
Maybe we should throw him overboard.

99
00:07:04,269 --> 00:07:06,134
Throw them both overboard.

100
00:07:07,372 --> 00:07:10,398
No witnesses. We could probably
get away with it.

101
00:07:13,678 --> 00:07:14,736
-You too?
-Yeah.

102
00:07:18,483 --> 00:07:20,815
l kept my nose out of it, but....

103
00:07:22,387 --> 00:07:23,684
You and Lorna.

104
00:07:25,824 --> 00:07:29,316
You're having a baby,
you're living together.

105
00:07:30,495 --> 00:07:31,826
You're not getting married.

106
00:07:33,231 --> 00:07:36,166
Why, does that violate your
family values system?

107
00:07:36,735 --> 00:07:39,602
l'm just trying to understand.

108
00:07:41,706 --> 00:07:43,333
Rianne's not married either.

109
00:07:43,708 --> 00:07:45,801
Okay, that's hitting below the belt.

110
00:07:50,015 --> 00:07:52,108
You know, when l was married...

111
00:07:52,851 --> 00:07:54,512
...it was good. You know.

112
00:07:55,020 --> 00:07:57,511
You put the ring on.
You make the commitment.

113
00:07:58,623 --> 00:07:59,988
You do all the....

114
00:08:02,761 --> 00:08:04,353
She's dead because l'm a cop.

115
00:08:05,530 --> 00:08:08,021
She's dead because l'm a cop and l....

116
00:08:08,333 --> 00:08:13,134
l don't wear the ring anymore but
l look down, it's still there.

117
00:08:13,772 --> 00:08:15,364
l still feel it...

118
00:08:16,141 --> 00:08:17,972
...and l don't know,
it's like l'm not...

119
00:08:18,977 --> 00:08:23,073
...finished with that yet. l don't know
how to explain that. ls that bullshit?

120
00:08:23,648 --> 00:08:25,639
No. lt's not finished.

121
00:08:26,751 --> 00:08:28,218
lt's not finished.

122
00:08:32,624 --> 00:08:34,888
Okay, you did say ''aft.''

123
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:36,752
A-F-T. Aft!

124
00:08:37,228 --> 00:08:38,490
That's a fucking word?

125
00:08:39,164 --> 00:08:41,223
ln the back of the cabin
on the right side!

126
00:08:41,833 --> 00:08:44,666
Why didn't you just say that
to begin with, Roger?!

127
00:08:45,270 --> 00:08:49,502
l love these people. Get around boats
and water, everything becomes nautical!

128
00:08:49,774 --> 00:08:52,072
''Astern! Avast, you landlubbers!

129
00:08:52,777 --> 00:08:54,472
Man the bilge pump!''

130
00:08:54,779 --> 00:08:56,246
Pump your fucking ass!

131
00:08:56,781 --> 00:08:57,975
All right, all right!

132
00:08:58,249 --> 00:09:00,581
-Get a grip.
-Okay, okay, okay.

133
00:09:00,819 --> 00:09:02,787
No problem. No problem. Okay, okay.

134
00:09:06,191 --> 00:09:09,991
-What does Lorna say about this?
-She doesn't like nautical terms either.

135
00:09:11,329 --> 00:09:14,389
We haven't discussed it.
That's pretty messed up.

136
00:09:14,666 --> 00:09:18,432
The baby's due in a few days and you
haven't talked about getting married?

137
00:09:18,803 --> 00:09:19,701
No.

138
00:09:20,438 --> 00:09:22,201
l haven't done it at all.

139
00:09:24,609 --> 00:09:27,874
-Do we want Leo to shoot the shark?
-l do want Leo to shoot the--

140
00:09:28,079 --> 00:09:28,943
No, Leo!

141
00:09:29,347 --> 00:09:30,405
What?!

142
00:09:31,883 --> 00:09:33,441
-Give me that.
-What's the deal?!

143
00:09:33,651 --> 00:09:34,948
You're shooting a gun on my boat!

144
00:09:35,153 --> 00:09:37,314
l'm not shooting your boat,
l'm shooting Jaws.

145
00:09:37,522 --> 00:09:38,682
Nobody's killing it.

146
00:09:38,890 --> 00:09:41,415
l won't let it die so
you can have its teeth!

147
00:09:41,626 --> 00:09:44,026
So grumpy since you
learned you'll be a grandpa.

148
00:09:44,229 --> 00:09:45,924
Get off of me, will you?

149
00:09:46,731 --> 00:09:48,255
Don't fool around!

150
00:09:49,634 --> 00:09:52,034
Some piece of hardware.
Got a permit for this?

151
00:09:52,237 --> 00:09:54,296
-Of course. l'm a Pl now.
-A ''P'' what?

152
00:09:54,506 --> 00:09:57,839
Pl! A gumshoe! You get in ugly
situations. l got guns, everything.

153
00:09:58,309 --> 00:09:59,936
You are an ugly situation.

154
00:10:00,145 --> 00:10:03,273
Permit or not, you don't deserve this.
You're not safe.

155
00:10:04,482 --> 00:10:05,847
Smart move, Riggs.

156
00:10:06,918 --> 00:10:07,748
Shit!

157
00:10:10,288 --> 00:10:11,255
Hard right, Rog!

158
00:10:13,491 --> 00:10:14,651
Did you hear shots?

159
00:10:15,260 --> 00:10:16,955
Coast Guard, this is Code 7.

160
00:10:25,170 --> 00:10:26,330
We're in L.A. Harbor.

161
00:10:28,173 --> 00:10:29,299
We got to go.

162
00:10:32,777 --> 00:10:34,176
They're getting away!

163
00:10:34,412 --> 00:10:36,073
Who was it? We know who it was?

164
00:10:37,515 --> 00:10:39,574
No, no, l'll drive!

165
00:10:42,620 --> 00:10:45,214
-Want me to help?
-Get out of here!

166
00:10:45,890 --> 00:10:46,720
This your gun?

167
00:10:46,958 --> 00:10:48,550
Yeah, want some laser surgery?

168
00:10:48,793 --> 00:10:50,693
Watch it! You could blind somebody!

169
00:10:53,998 --> 00:10:56,796
Coast Guard, this is Code 7
in pursuit of freighter.

170
00:10:57,135 --> 00:10:58,159
Heading north.

171
00:10:58,503 --> 00:11:00,232
Awaiting instructions. Over.

172
00:11:00,638 --> 00:11:03,163
Code 7 , maintain your present course.

173
00:11:03,508 --> 00:11:05,169
We have a cutter en route.

174
00:11:05,777 --> 00:11:07,176
Why you slowing down for?

175
00:11:07,378 --> 00:11:10,245
We'll hang right here.
Coast Guard'll be here any minute.

176
00:11:10,748 --> 00:11:13,046
-What do we do now?
-Show them our badges.

177
00:11:13,384 --> 00:11:14,510
LAPD!

178
00:11:14,819 --> 00:11:15,717
LAPD!

179
00:11:16,054 --> 00:11:17,749
Los Angeles Police Department!

180
00:11:17,956 --> 00:11:20,015
We heard gunfire!
The Coast Guard's on the--

181
00:11:47,685 --> 00:11:50,279
Coast Guard! Boat's on fire!
Freighter's on fire!

182
00:11:50,622 --> 00:11:53,147
-Let's board them.
-What are you talking about?!

183
00:11:53,458 --> 00:11:55,392
There's a fire on the freighter!

184
00:12:00,431 --> 00:12:03,264
Okay, l'm upside. Now what do we do?

185
00:12:03,568 --> 00:12:05,559
They're trying to get away.
Get up there!

186
00:12:11,576 --> 00:12:13,100
One hell of a fishing trip.

187
00:12:13,311 --> 00:12:15,370
Shut up and keep your head down!

188
00:12:15,580 --> 00:12:16,376
LAPD!

189
00:12:16,714 --> 00:12:17,578
LAPD!

190
00:12:17,882 --> 00:12:19,577
Stop where you are! You!

191
00:12:19,884 --> 00:12:20,782
Hold it there!

192
00:12:23,421 --> 00:12:24,251
He's got it!

193
00:12:29,193 --> 00:12:29,989
What'd he say?

194
00:12:30,328 --> 00:12:31,625
He said, watch his back!

195
00:12:34,432 --> 00:12:36,024
-Why didn't you warn me?
-Shut up!

196
00:12:37,835 --> 00:12:38,802
Tie it up!

197
00:12:41,306 --> 00:12:42,330
Pull it out!

198
00:12:49,614 --> 00:12:50,808
That was great.

199
00:12:51,616 --> 00:12:53,607
l told you to keep the boat closer!

200
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:56,810
Why are you listening to Leo?

201
00:13:06,030 --> 00:13:07,224
Oh, shit!

202
00:13:17,141 --> 00:13:18,665
You all right, Riggs?!

203
00:13:21,679 --> 00:13:22,543
Look at that!

204
00:13:25,049 --> 00:13:26,311
Oh, shit!

205
00:13:26,517 --> 00:13:27,347
Jump!

206
00:13:27,552 --> 00:13:28,382
Jump!

207
00:13:34,292 --> 00:13:35,884
Roger, where are you?!

208
00:13:36,527 --> 00:13:37,459
My boat!

209
00:13:38,062 --> 00:13:39,086
My new boat!

210
00:13:56,481 --> 00:13:57,675
-What?
-The shark.

211
00:13:57,882 --> 00:13:59,474
What about the shark?

212
00:13:59,817 --> 00:14:00,681
A shark!

213
00:14:03,888 --> 00:14:05,583
Don't leave me! Rog!

214
00:14:19,437 --> 00:14:20,369
Come on, Leo!

215
00:14:31,416 --> 00:14:33,111
-Hurry up!
-l'm coming!

216
00:14:53,204 --> 00:14:54,228
You can make it!

217
00:15:02,346 --> 00:15:03,643
This is all l got left.

218
00:15:31,642 --> 00:15:34,270
Four sets of papers, totally genuine.

219
00:15:34,812 --> 00:15:37,610
They'll get in the country
and be able to stay forever.

220
00:15:37,982 --> 00:15:39,609
U.S. citizens.

221
00:15:40,985 --> 00:15:43,510
Ask them to vote the incumbent
party, help me...

222
00:15:43,721 --> 00:15:45,780
...keep my job with the
State Department.

223
00:15:46,190 --> 00:15:47,418
Bloody marvelous.

224
00:15:47,792 --> 00:15:51,455
They've red-flagged Asian visas lately.
Those weren't easy to slip through.

225
00:16:06,277 --> 00:16:07,642
Something wrong?

226
00:16:09,947 --> 00:16:12,711
A small delivery problem, Mr. Proody.

227
00:16:20,024 --> 00:16:20,854
Leave!

228
00:17:35,533 --> 00:17:38,093
Coast Guard interdicts
about one a month.

229
00:17:38,436 --> 00:17:39,596
Pretty raggedy-looking.

230
00:17:39,937 --> 00:17:42,497
Six weeks locked in a hold
with one toilet.

231
00:17:42,773 --> 00:17:44,434
Rice and a little fish to eat.

232
00:17:44,709 --> 00:17:46,233
Lousy deal for 35 grand a head.

233
00:17:46,711 --> 00:17:48,906
35 grand? Where'd they
get that money?

234
00:17:49,213 --> 00:17:53,240
Didn't. Got to work it off from
the snakeheads, the smugglers.

235
00:17:53,951 --> 00:17:56,112
-They sell them as cheap labor.
-Sell them?

236
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:57,150
Like slaves.

237
00:17:59,991 --> 00:18:01,925
l guess these must be the lucky ones.

238
00:18:02,126 --> 00:18:06,062
They'll claim asylum. Say they were
persecuted, like everybody else.

239
00:18:06,397 --> 00:18:07,728
We'll send them packing.

240
00:18:08,065 --> 00:18:09,965
Cost you and me a goddamn fortune.

241
00:18:10,334 --> 00:18:13,735
What happened to, ''Bring me your tired,
your poor, your wretched masses...

242
00:18:14,171 --> 00:18:15,399
...yearning to be free''?

243
00:18:15,940 --> 00:18:17,771
Now it reads, ''No vacancies.''

244
00:18:18,542 --> 00:18:20,476
l guess your parents
were Native Americans.

245
00:18:26,150 --> 00:18:28,277
They pop one every boatload.

246
00:18:28,819 --> 00:18:31,686
Shows the rest what'll happen
if they run or don't pay.

247
00:18:34,158 --> 00:18:35,648
At least he's nobody's slave.

248
00:18:37,561 --> 00:18:39,153
Don't coddle them, move them!

249
00:18:39,430 --> 00:18:41,796
We're on the boat, l see
this barrel coming down.

250
00:18:42,166 --> 00:18:44,498
Sergeant Murtaugh didn't see it,
so l push him.

251
00:18:44,835 --> 00:18:47,565
He's big, l knock him over.
We're in the water.

252
00:18:47,772 --> 00:18:50,468
l'm pulling, he doesn't swim.
l saved this big guy.

253
00:18:51,008 --> 00:18:54,375
There's that kid.
What's his name? Bissell?

254
00:18:54,712 --> 00:18:55,872
lt's a food.

255
00:18:56,213 --> 00:18:57,043
Burger.

256
00:18:57,381 --> 00:18:58,848
No, Biscuits or something.

257
00:18:59,183 --> 00:19:01,879
He's always kissing my ass,
giving me coffee and shit.

258
00:19:02,386 --> 00:19:05,321
Sergeant Riggs, Sergeant Murtaugh.
What are you doing here?

259
00:19:05,656 --> 00:19:06,486
That's a long story.

260
00:19:06,824 --> 00:19:08,018
You're all wet!

261
00:19:08,826 --> 00:19:10,418
-You need a blanket?
-l'm fine.

262
00:19:10,828 --> 00:19:14,195
-Somebody get this man a blanket now!
-Blankets, yes, sir!

263
00:19:15,199 --> 00:19:16,632
Get this body out of here!

264
00:19:17,001 --> 00:19:18,332
Hold up! What do we got here?

265
00:19:18,669 --> 00:19:20,500
Stay back, stay back.

266
00:19:22,406 --> 00:19:23,532
Shit!

267
00:19:23,874 --> 00:19:26,069
He's dead. He's fucking dead, man!

268
00:19:26,410 --> 00:19:27,638
-Shit!
-What?

269
00:19:28,012 --> 00:19:30,480
This is how he wanted to
come to America, right?

270
00:19:30,815 --> 00:19:32,442
Was he in the killing section?

271
00:19:32,817 --> 00:19:34,717
This guy's been shot four times!

272
00:19:35,820 --> 00:19:38,311
At close range, like he was executed!

273
00:19:38,656 --> 00:19:39,714
He was executed.

274
00:19:40,057 --> 00:19:40,887
By the crew.

275
00:19:41,859 --> 00:19:43,224
What the fuck!

276
00:19:44,261 --> 00:19:46,957
People get killed left,
right and center in this town!

277
00:19:47,164 --> 00:19:48,893
Now we're importing victims?

278
00:19:49,233 --> 00:19:52,498
Gangbangers want to kill
each other, no problem.

279
00:19:52,837 --> 00:19:55,237
One of us gets shot,
occupational hazard.

280
00:19:55,639 --> 00:19:59,769
But just a normal guy? What the
fuck did he ever do to anybody?!

281
00:20:00,111 --> 00:20:01,840
-That ain't right.
-Easy, Biscuits.

282
00:20:02,046 --> 00:20:04,241
You'll get an ulcer.
You got to settle down.

283
00:20:04,582 --> 00:20:05,446
Blanket!

284
00:20:05,783 --> 00:20:08,343
l thought it was....
Sorry, Blankets.

285
00:20:08,652 --> 00:20:10,950
-Here's blankets.
-Sorry, l'm losing my head.

286
00:20:11,288 --> 00:20:14,257
l just hate to see bad things
happen to good folk.

287
00:20:14,558 --> 00:20:18,688
We'd shoot the breeze with you, Butler,
but you're in charge here so--

288
00:20:19,063 --> 00:20:21,930
You should take this, it's free.
You're all wet.

289
00:20:22,266 --> 00:20:24,097
Get some vapor rub on your chest.

290
00:20:24,468 --> 00:20:26,459
All right, Boogers.

291
00:20:27,271 --> 00:20:31,503
Hey, get them out of here!
Get them out of here!

292
00:20:33,077 --> 00:20:35,068
He takes the job kind of personally.

293
00:20:35,279 --> 00:20:38,806
Personally? Yeah, he's pretty serious,
l'd say. Overzealous.

294
00:20:39,016 --> 00:20:40,381
He's jealous of who?

295
00:20:40,584 --> 00:20:41,551
l don't know. Who?

296
00:20:41,752 --> 00:20:43,515
-You said he was jealous.
-l didn't.

297
00:20:43,721 --> 00:20:45,086
l was standing here!

298
00:20:45,289 --> 00:20:47,484
l said he was zealous. Full of zeal.

299
00:20:47,691 --> 00:20:49,556
-He's loud too. Shit.
-What?

300
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:51,421
-He's loud!
-What?

301
00:20:51,729 --> 00:20:53,697
We better get up before
the sun comes up.

302
00:20:53,898 --> 00:20:55,422
Something's in the lifeboat.

303
00:20:55,633 --> 00:20:57,362
-l'll catch a squad ride.
-See you.

304
00:21:01,372 --> 00:21:02,930
l'm sorry about your boat.

305
00:21:06,377 --> 00:21:08,607
-l'm sorry.
-Shit.

306
00:21:08,913 --> 00:21:11,381
All of a sudden, this big
fucking shark comes--

307
00:21:11,582 --> 00:21:12,708
Can l say that?

308
00:21:12,917 --> 00:21:15,249
You can say it, but we can't air it.

309
00:21:15,452 --> 00:21:18,319
So this big darn shark comes along....

310
00:21:29,466 --> 00:21:30,330
Shit.

311
00:21:30,534 --> 00:21:32,126
My Code 7.

312
00:22:08,105 --> 00:22:09,436
Oh, God.

313
00:22:18,582 --> 00:22:21,210
-You were coming home last night.
-l'm sorry.

314
00:22:21,719 --> 00:22:23,186
l had some bad Chinese.

315
00:22:24,722 --> 00:22:26,383
You look a little banged up.

316
00:22:26,891 --> 00:22:28,825
You look a little knocked up.

317
00:22:31,629 --> 00:22:32,823
Are you okay?

318
00:22:33,030 --> 00:22:34,190
You sure?

319
00:22:35,199 --> 00:22:38,999
-Easy, tiger! There he goes again.
-She. There she goes again.

320
00:22:40,704 --> 00:22:42,103
-You okay, though?
-l'm good.

321
00:22:42,306 --> 00:22:44,206
Better than Roger. His boat sank.

322
00:22:44,742 --> 00:22:46,937
-Boat sank?
-l had something to do with it.

323
00:22:47,144 --> 00:22:48,509
-Here, boy.
-No! No grease!

324
00:22:50,414 --> 00:22:52,905
-Have some cookies.
-What happened?

325
00:22:54,318 --> 00:22:56,752
Gunfights, explosions, sharks.
The usual.

326
00:22:57,221 --> 00:22:58,210
Here, boy.

327
00:22:59,924 --> 00:23:00,913
Thanks.

328
00:23:01,225 --> 00:23:05,218
You were out fishing.
Does trouble just go looking for you?

329
00:23:05,496 --> 00:23:08,431
lt seems to know pretty much
where l am most of the time.

330
00:23:08,732 --> 00:23:09,892
Oh, God.

331
00:23:10,334 --> 00:23:11,631
You finished the nursery.

332
00:23:12,636 --> 00:23:13,660
Yeah, l did.

333
00:23:13,904 --> 00:23:16,839
l figured it was good for a girl
or a boy. Cute, huh?

334
00:23:17,041 --> 00:23:19,532
lt's a dogfest. What'd you get,
the whole 1 0 1 ?

335
00:23:19,743 --> 00:23:22,678
l know. l got a little
carried away with puppies.

336
00:23:23,113 --> 00:23:24,910
lKid'll probably hate dogs.

337
00:23:28,686 --> 00:23:33,055
You know, Lorna, we never ever
talked about marriage.

338
00:23:45,069 --> 00:23:47,299
l sort of figured you didn't want that.

339
00:23:51,075 --> 00:23:52,474
You want to get married?

340
00:23:59,550 --> 00:24:00,574
Me neither.

341
00:24:02,219 --> 00:24:03,413
You want breakfast?

342
00:24:19,703 --> 00:24:22,103
''Serve and Protect''

343
00:24:22,506 --> 00:24:24,906
Since when have you been
reading this smut?

344
00:24:26,777 --> 00:24:28,802
lt's not smut. lt's Ebony Clark.

345
00:24:29,313 --> 00:24:33,579
-Trish gave it to me.
-''Every fiber in his being desired her.

346
00:24:33,984 --> 00:24:35,952
He devoured her with his eyes.''

347
00:24:37,121 --> 00:24:40,579
Can we try this thing
on page 1 96 sometime?

348
00:24:43,127 --> 00:24:45,789
There's a good one on 1 68. Maybe later.

349
00:24:45,996 --> 00:24:48,658
Nothing comes between
a pregnant lady and a meal.

350
00:24:50,234 --> 00:24:52,134
Have l ever ''made your...

351
00:24:52,636 --> 00:24:56,629
...womanhood reach peaks that would
rival the highest Himalayas''?

352
00:24:56,874 --> 00:25:00,469
-Foothills of Malibu, maybe.
-But not even a Teton or...?

353
00:25:00,677 --> 00:25:02,167
-l don't think so.
-Thanks.

354
00:25:02,379 --> 00:25:04,870
l thought l'd at least rate the Rockies.

355
00:25:05,149 --> 00:25:06,673
You know l'm kidding.

356
00:25:07,885 --> 00:25:09,978
You're saying that to
make me feel better.

357
00:25:10,187 --> 00:25:11,176
No, l'm not.

358
00:25:12,156 --> 00:25:13,350
You know l'm playing.

359
00:25:13,557 --> 00:25:16,048
l've been to plenty of
mountaintops with you.

360
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:18,460
lt's just that l'm hungry.

361
00:25:20,097 --> 00:25:22,964
When you have that kid,
we'll blow up Mount Saint Helens.

362
00:25:23,367 --> 00:25:25,665
-l brought you a doughnut.
-Police food.

363
00:25:25,869 --> 00:25:27,200
How did you know?

364
00:25:29,373 --> 00:25:31,603
l dropped by lnternal Affairs yesterday.

365
00:25:31,809 --> 00:25:33,174
How's the rat squad?

366
00:25:33,377 --> 00:25:35,971
-l picked up something good.
-Some cheese?

367
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:39,012
lA got an anonymous tip.

368
00:25:39,383 --> 00:25:41,578
The person said Roger's on the take.

369
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:44,184
No, he's not.

370
00:25:44,388 --> 00:25:47,585
l know he's not. lt's probably
some jerk he put away.

371
00:25:48,058 --> 00:25:49,252
But with the new boats...

372
00:25:49,460 --> 00:25:53,123
...and putting 2 kids through college,
l just thought you ought to know.

373
00:25:53,330 --> 00:25:56,265
l actually tried to persuade him
to take money.

374
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:59,865
Stop it, Riggs! l can't hear that.
Nothing.

375
00:26:00,070 --> 00:26:02,402
l won't say anything anymore.
l'm kidding.

376
00:26:02,606 --> 00:26:04,267
-That's awful.
-l'm kidding.

377
00:26:04,875 --> 00:26:07,241
Don't tell him l said that.
With all his problems...

378
00:26:07,444 --> 00:26:11,005
...he'll blow his top. lt'll be awful.
Just don't say anything.

379
00:26:12,816 --> 00:26:13,874
What do you mean?

380
00:26:16,820 --> 00:26:17,946
Like what?

381
00:26:18,288 --> 00:26:20,813
-ln general, problems.
-You mean something specific.

382
00:26:21,024 --> 00:26:23,015
l got a nose for these things. What?

383
00:26:24,261 --> 00:26:27,753
You're pushing me. l really don't
want you to go there.

384
00:26:27,965 --> 00:26:31,230
Get it off your chest.
You'll feel better. Tell me.

385
00:26:31,435 --> 00:26:33,767
l'm not going to leave
you alone. Tell me.

386
00:26:33,971 --> 00:26:36,098
-Tell me.
-l'll tell you what it is!

387
00:26:36,306 --> 00:26:38,968
This pregnancy destroyed my brain cells!

388
00:26:39,910 --> 00:26:41,639
What? What?

389
00:26:41,912 --> 00:26:43,573
l'm drooling. What?

390
00:26:45,482 --> 00:26:49,441
Promise me. Swear to me you'll
never say a word about this, ever.

391
00:26:49,653 --> 00:26:51,382
-l swear, l swear.
-Right hand!

392
00:26:51,588 --> 00:26:53,078
l swear l won't, ever.

393
00:26:53,290 --> 00:26:54,655
l promise. What?

394
00:26:55,993 --> 00:26:58,791
You know how Roger is about
his daughter dating cops?

395
00:26:58,996 --> 00:27:00,463
He'd kill them. So?

396
00:27:00,797 --> 00:27:04,858
Rianne's married to one, the father of
her baby. She's afraid to tell Roger.

397
00:27:05,102 --> 00:27:08,560
They met last year. They fell in love.
She got pregnant. They got hitched.

398
00:27:08,772 --> 00:27:10,740
Nobody's telling Roger about this?

399
00:27:10,941 --> 00:27:12,272
After the baby's born.

400
00:27:12,476 --> 00:27:15,775
You mean it's a package deal?
Take it or leave it?

401
00:27:16,513 --> 00:27:18,276
-Does Trish know?
-She knows.

402
00:27:18,782 --> 00:27:21,114
She doesn't know you know.
But Trish knows.

403
00:27:21,318 --> 00:27:23,980
Who's the lucky soon-to-be-dead
son-in-law?

404
00:27:24,888 --> 00:27:27,288
-Who?
-Sergeant Lee Butters.

405
00:27:27,524 --> 00:27:30,687
This gets better and better!
No wonder he sucks up to Rog.

406
00:27:30,894 --> 00:27:32,759
Brings him apples, blankets, coffee....

407
00:27:32,963 --> 00:27:35,830
Not a word. l'm telling you, nothing.

408
00:27:36,033 --> 00:27:40,129
l won't tell him anything. He'd shoot
me just for being the messenger.

409
00:27:40,437 --> 00:27:44,203
He's my best friend. lt'd be wrong to
mess with him. l won't mess with him.

410
00:27:47,311 --> 00:27:48,369
Promise.

411
00:27:50,781 --> 00:27:54,842
l don't think we have to discuss boys'
names because we're having a girl.

412
00:27:55,452 --> 00:27:57,317
Okay. Piadora.

413
00:27:57,521 --> 00:28:00,115
l like Piadora. That's sweet.

414
00:28:02,526 --> 00:28:04,756
-l can't live with that.
-l love that name.

415
00:28:05,028 --> 00:28:06,859
-Wilford.
-lt's the oatmeal guy.

416
00:28:07,130 --> 00:28:10,793
We're talking kids' names.
Has Rianne picked any names out yet?

417
00:28:11,001 --> 00:28:13,333
We don't want to double up or anything.

418
00:28:13,537 --> 00:28:16,005
Oscar for the boy,
Loreen if it's a girl.

419
00:28:16,206 --> 00:28:17,400
l like Lee Butter.

420
00:28:17,641 --> 00:28:19,131
Better! l like it better.

421
00:28:19,343 --> 00:28:21,607
-Don't get me started.
-l like those names.

422
00:28:21,845 --> 00:28:23,540
Captain wants to see us downtown.

423
00:28:23,747 --> 00:28:26,545
Trish'll be right down. Have fun
shopping for the baby.

424
00:28:26,750 --> 00:28:27,876
Bye-bye, honey.

425
00:28:28,352 --> 00:28:30,343
Who had the sleepover?

426
00:28:30,554 --> 00:28:31,953
Just airing out camping gear.

427
00:28:32,155 --> 00:28:33,952
-We're out of here.
-Something smells good.

428
00:28:34,157 --> 00:28:35,351
Really good.

429
00:28:35,559 --> 00:28:36,890
Trish has food on the stove.

430
00:28:37,094 --> 00:28:38,152
We out of here.

431
00:28:38,562 --> 00:28:40,359
That smells like Chinese food.

432
00:28:40,564 --> 00:28:42,464
Chinese food?

433
00:28:42,666 --> 00:28:44,566
She's into Chinese cooking.

434
00:28:44,768 --> 00:28:46,895
l got to see this. Can l taste?

435
00:28:47,671 --> 00:28:49,969
-l love Chinese food.
-Hold it! Please!

436
00:28:50,173 --> 00:28:51,401
Please!

437
00:28:52,409 --> 00:28:54,309
There's a Chinese person in the kitchen.

438
00:28:54,511 --> 00:28:55,569
l saw him.

439
00:28:56,513 --> 00:28:58,504
A couple of Chinese people.

440
00:28:58,849 --> 00:29:00,646
Actually a whole family.

441
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:04,052
A large family.

442
00:29:07,891 --> 00:29:08,858
Hey, guys.

443
00:29:13,797 --> 00:29:15,924
-lt does smell good, huh?
-Smells great.

444
00:29:16,199 --> 00:29:18,190
They were hiding in the lifeboat.

445
00:29:18,468 --> 00:29:20,595
After that lNS guy,
l had to do something.

446
00:29:21,004 --> 00:29:24,064
-l know. So you brought them home.
-lt took two trips.

447
00:29:24,274 --> 00:29:26,868
-Really?
-They fit in the station wagon?

448
00:29:27,110 --> 00:29:29,237
That's Ping with his grandfather, Hong.

449
00:29:29,446 --> 00:29:31,676
He's head of the family.
Speaks English.

450
00:29:31,882 --> 00:29:35,545
Hey, Hong. This is my partner,
Martin Riggs, and this is Lorna.

451
00:29:36,420 --> 00:29:37,250
Wife?

452
00:29:40,123 --> 00:29:41,522
Can l speak to you?

453
00:29:41,725 --> 00:29:46,253
-Lorna, this is the best breakfast.
-l'm hungry. l'd love some.

454
00:29:47,064 --> 00:29:49,294
Are you out of your mind?
This is illegal.

455
00:29:49,566 --> 00:29:51,033
As in, ''against the law.''

456
00:29:51,234 --> 00:29:53,031
You'll bring on a shitstorm.

457
00:29:53,236 --> 00:29:56,034
Just hold on!
Just wait a frigging minute!

458
00:29:56,840 --> 00:30:00,298
The way l see it, those are
slave ships out there...

459
00:30:00,677 --> 00:30:02,440
...and l'm freeing slaves.

460
00:30:02,779 --> 00:30:06,442
l'm freeing slaves like
no one did for my ancestors.

461
00:30:09,286 --> 00:30:12,187
This is my chance to do
something and do it right.

462
00:30:15,125 --> 00:30:15,955
Why didn't you say so?

463
00:30:16,159 --> 00:30:17,888
This is not going to be boring.

464
00:30:18,095 --> 00:30:19,084
Need any help?

465
00:30:21,498 --> 00:30:22,658
Where is he?

466
00:30:26,169 --> 00:30:27,466
What is it, food or money?

467
00:30:27,671 --> 00:30:29,571
-Food and money.
-More money than food.

468
00:30:29,773 --> 00:30:31,673
l see you more now than
when you lived here.

469
00:30:31,875 --> 00:30:35,072
-We're independent now.
-What'll you spend the money for?

470
00:30:35,278 --> 00:30:37,007
-Hookers, drugs....
-Contraceptives.

471
00:30:37,581 --> 00:30:39,947
Can you believe how they
talk to their father?

472
00:30:40,150 --> 00:30:43,313
lt costs more to go to school now
than it did when you went.

473
00:30:44,321 --> 00:30:46,949
Go to school now!
l get the tuition bills.

474
00:30:47,157 --> 00:30:51,491
And the grades too. Consider this a
down payment on a future ass-chewing.

475
00:30:51,695 --> 00:30:54,129
Now get out of here and go to school.

476
00:30:54,331 --> 00:30:56,299
l want to see grades!
l see the tuition.

477
00:30:56,500 --> 00:31:00,095
l want to see some grades, okay?
l want more cluck for my buck.

478
00:31:00,337 --> 00:31:01,827
Thank you for the money.

479
00:31:04,708 --> 00:31:05,640
l'm tired.

480
00:31:05,842 --> 00:31:07,639
Me, l can't win.

481
00:31:07,844 --> 00:31:09,004
Boy.

482
00:31:10,313 --> 00:31:13,180
Say, we get a raise and
nobody told me about it?

483
00:31:16,119 --> 00:31:17,552
l got to get to the bank.

484
00:31:17,754 --> 00:31:20,848
How can you when you're taken
to the cleaners all the time?

485
00:31:23,427 --> 00:31:24,257
Hey, guys.

486
00:31:26,196 --> 00:31:27,060
Hey, babe.

487
00:31:27,264 --> 00:31:30,256
-Both the kids leaving?
-Yes. And we're broke.

488
00:31:30,467 --> 00:31:31,525
ls Lorna here?

489
00:31:31,735 --> 00:31:34,533
She's in the kitchen.
On her third breakfast by now.

490
00:31:34,738 --> 00:31:36,365
l remember those days.

491
00:31:37,874 --> 00:31:40,434
-l'm sorry!
-You know l love it when you do that.

492
00:31:42,045 --> 00:31:43,376
You look terrific.

493
00:31:44,047 --> 00:31:46,607
Wait till she tries raising
that baby by herself.

494
00:31:46,817 --> 00:31:47,977
Daddy, l'll be fine.

495
00:31:48,552 --> 00:31:51,953
Move back in and old Grandpa Rog'll
be up all night taking care of the baby.

496
00:31:52,155 --> 00:31:54,282
Better than her marrying the wrong guy.

497
00:31:56,560 --> 00:31:58,187
You know, a cop or something.

498
00:31:59,029 --> 00:31:59,996
True.

499
00:32:00,197 --> 00:32:01,960
Come on, guys. See you.

500
00:32:02,165 --> 00:32:03,962
l should say goodbye.

501
00:32:04,401 --> 00:32:05,459
Hurry up!

502
00:32:06,169 --> 00:32:07,693
Yeah, stuffing your face.

503
00:32:07,904 --> 00:32:10,429
Stop kissing me. Try that. Try that.

504
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:12,540
You, stay away from my girl.

505
00:32:12,709 --> 00:32:15,371
l'm not joking.
You stay away from my girl.

506
00:32:15,579 --> 00:32:16,443
Joking!

507
00:32:16,646 --> 00:32:18,876
Got the baby beeper?

508
00:32:24,654 --> 00:32:26,781
-All right, l know.
-lt's your fault.

509
00:32:26,990 --> 00:32:29,515
lt's your fault. All the chicken shit.

510
00:32:29,726 --> 00:32:31,717
Flapping all over the place.

511
00:32:34,030 --> 00:32:35,122
All right, everybody.

512
00:32:35,398 --> 00:32:39,391
lt's been a year almost already.
This shit ain't funny no more.

513
00:32:41,104 --> 00:32:42,628
-Enough is enough!
-Please!

514
00:32:42,839 --> 00:32:43,863
Okay? Enough!

515
00:32:44,074 --> 00:32:48,010
l'm the one that gets it in the neck.
Can we exercise a little maturity?

516
00:32:48,211 --> 00:32:50,736
lf l find who's doing this,
l'll kick his ass.

517
00:32:52,616 --> 00:32:56,416
Who's doing this? l catch that asshole
who put my picture up there, that's it.

518
00:32:56,686 --> 00:32:58,210
-That's it.
-Cut their balls off.

519
00:32:58,421 --> 00:32:59,615
Captain.

520
00:33:01,525 --> 00:33:04,323
l still look out there expecting
to see all the old faces.

521
00:33:04,528 --> 00:33:07,929
lnstead, l see a bunch of kids whose
names l barely remember.

522
00:33:08,365 --> 00:33:10,424
-Will you sit down?
-Sorry.

523
00:33:10,634 --> 00:33:12,363
We're dinosaurs headed for extinction.

524
00:33:12,636 --> 00:33:13,568
Speak for yourself.

525
00:33:13,770 --> 00:33:15,897
We're making way for the
new police force:

526
00:33:16,106 --> 00:33:20,770
Guys with guns and psychology degrees,
like Butters out there.

527
00:33:25,382 --> 00:33:27,350
Biter has a psychology degree?

528
00:33:27,551 --> 00:33:31,351
-More like a psycho degree.
-Times have got to change.

529
00:33:31,555 --> 00:33:34,353
l once got shot by a hot rodder
with a zip gun.

530
00:33:34,558 --> 00:33:36,321
That's how far back l go.

531
00:33:37,928 --> 00:33:39,486
You wanted to see us?

532
00:33:39,763 --> 00:33:41,390
Some things don't change.

533
00:33:41,598 --> 00:33:44,465
-Here we go.
-The department lost its insurance.

534
00:33:44,668 --> 00:33:47,569
All the damage you've done,
they can't get a new one...

535
00:33:47,771 --> 00:33:50,262
...while you two still run around
on the streets.

536
00:33:51,675 --> 00:33:53,905
They can't fire you either.

537
00:33:54,110 --> 00:33:55,099
So...

538
00:33:55,612 --> 00:33:57,011
...they're promoting you.

539
00:33:59,015 --> 00:34:00,107
Lieutenant.

540
00:34:00,517 --> 00:34:02,314
There's no open lieutenant spots.

541
00:34:02,519 --> 00:34:06,353
So the chief's using a special privilege
and making you captains.

542
00:34:07,524 --> 00:34:09,355
-Better.
-Captain!

543
00:34:09,693 --> 00:34:13,754
Time was when this would send me over
the falls. l swear, l'm getting old.

544
00:34:15,131 --> 00:34:16,291
So what do we do now?

545
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:18,131
Captain shit.

546
00:34:18,335 --> 00:34:20,701
-Hang out.
-Take long lunches.

547
00:34:20,904 --> 00:34:24,169
Yell things like,
''Riggs, Murtaugh, l'm the captain.''

548
00:34:24,374 --> 00:34:27,036
-''Chief's shitting bricks, man.''
-You finished?

549
00:34:27,711 --> 00:34:30,509
Think you can stay out of trouble?
Something simple?

550
00:34:30,714 --> 00:34:32,113
Absolutely.

551
00:34:32,315 --> 00:34:33,304
Captain Riggs.

552
00:34:33,516 --> 00:34:34,778
Captain Murtaugh.

553
00:34:43,393 --> 00:34:46,829
You want your badges?
Let me see those sergeant badges.

554
00:34:47,030 --> 00:34:49,328
Throw them over here.
Let me have yours.

555
00:34:51,334 --> 00:34:53,859
This is the most painful
experience of my life.

556
00:34:54,237 --> 00:34:56,831
-Now get out of here.
-Thank you, Captain.

557
00:34:57,040 --> 00:34:59,235
-Thank you, Captain.
-No, Captain, after you.

558
00:34:59,843 --> 00:35:02,539
Enough with the ''Captain'' shit!
Get out of here!

559
00:35:02,746 --> 00:35:06,648
l insist. After you, Captain, l insist!
''O Captain! My Captain!''

560
00:35:06,850 --> 00:35:08,750
-Captains outrageous!
-News travels.

561
00:35:09,552 --> 00:35:12,749
You get a break from real police work.
Play golf, tennis....

562
00:35:12,956 --> 00:35:16,016
They got brown rings
Around their noses

563
00:35:17,260 --> 00:35:20,024
Now that you're captains,
come up in the chopper.

564
00:35:20,230 --> 00:35:21,993
-Not for me.
-l'll take a raincheck.

565
00:35:22,198 --> 00:35:25,565
-lf you change your mind, call us.
-He's a down-to-earth guy.

566
00:35:27,370 --> 00:35:28,564
l'm sorry.

567
00:35:30,573 --> 00:35:35,442
Can we knock this shit off, please?
This is your captain speaking.

568
00:35:36,446 --> 00:35:37,777
Jesus.

569
00:35:38,615 --> 00:35:40,606
The man's got feelings, you know?

570
00:35:47,991 --> 00:35:49,788
Congratulations. Look at you.

571
00:35:49,993 --> 00:35:51,722
Captain Murtaugh.

572
00:35:51,995 --> 00:35:55,988
l don't really know how to say this,
but you really inspire me.

573
00:35:57,901 --> 00:35:59,061
lKeep it up.

574
00:35:59,469 --> 00:36:00,800
How's it going, Burton?

575
00:36:01,004 --> 00:36:03,632
-lt's Butters, Captain.
-l'll remember that.

576
00:36:03,940 --> 00:36:06,807
-lKid really likes you.
-l wish he'd cut that shit out.

577
00:36:07,043 --> 00:36:08,476
He likes me?

578
00:36:10,613 --> 00:36:11,910
Likes me.

579
00:36:16,753 --> 00:36:17,879
You don't think he...

580
00:36:18,421 --> 00:36:19,683
...likes me-likes me...?

581
00:36:20,757 --> 00:36:22,622
Likes me like that?

582
00:36:26,329 --> 00:36:28,229
lt's the police force
not the military.

583
00:36:28,498 --> 00:36:30,625
The millennium's creeping up on us.

584
00:36:30,834 --> 00:36:34,429
You know what the captain said:
''New people, new department.''

585
00:36:42,178 --> 00:36:43,509
Dr. Woods?

586
00:36:45,782 --> 00:36:46,908
Captain Riggs.

587
00:36:47,117 --> 00:36:48,914
-Don't run.
-l'm in a rush.

588
00:36:49,119 --> 00:36:52,646
-l need to talk to you.
-Wait! What is it this time?

589
00:36:52,856 --> 00:36:55,086
Recurring dreams about flying dwarfs?

590
00:36:55,291 --> 00:36:57,282
Or have you cooked up something new?

591
00:36:57,494 --> 00:36:58,927
l'm sorry about all that.

592
00:36:59,162 --> 00:37:01,323
l want your advice.
l was thinking of....

593
00:37:01,531 --> 00:37:02,589
Thinking?

594
00:37:02,799 --> 00:37:03,663
Marriage.

595
00:37:04,601 --> 00:37:06,000
Marriage?!

596
00:37:06,669 --> 00:37:10,070
-The ''M'' word?
-Does ''confidentiality'' mean anything?

597
00:37:10,273 --> 00:37:11,570
-That's funny.
-lKeep it down.

598
00:37:11,775 --> 00:37:14,608
You know what would happen?
We'd go into my office...

599
00:37:14,878 --> 00:37:17,005
...and you know what you'd
end up telling me?

600
00:37:17,213 --> 00:37:20,273
You'd tell me something like, ''Doc...

601
00:37:20,517 --> 00:37:22,678
...l want to marry Murtaugh.''

602
00:37:22,886 --> 00:37:25,514
Or your mother, maybe.
Or how about Nelson Mandela?

603
00:37:25,722 --> 00:37:27,019
Nelson Mandela?!

604
00:37:27,290 --> 00:37:29,781
Something to ridicule me, Riggs.

605
00:37:29,993 --> 00:37:32,587
Something to get a rise out of me.

606
00:37:33,029 --> 00:37:34,326
Listen carefully!

607
00:37:34,531 --> 00:37:36,897
l'm...not...stupid!

608
00:37:37,700 --> 00:37:39,895
And my time is reserved...

609
00:37:40,136 --> 00:37:44,163
...for police officers with
real needs and real problems.

610
00:37:44,374 --> 00:37:45,898
Have you got that?!

611
00:37:46,910 --> 00:37:48,502
-Have you?!
-Ask me again?

612
00:37:48,711 --> 00:37:50,611
No. And you know what?

613
00:37:51,247 --> 00:37:52,578
l don't like you.

614
00:37:56,820 --> 00:37:58,151
Stephanie?

615
00:37:58,721 --> 00:38:01,815
l can't go out with you.
l'm in a relationship.

616
00:38:02,025 --> 00:38:04,220
All right?
l think you need to see someone.

617
00:38:04,427 --> 00:38:08,659
You'll find someone someday who'll love
you. Not in this department but....

618
00:38:08,865 --> 00:38:12,323
-You have to stop bothering me!
-You're disgusting!

619
00:38:12,535 --> 00:38:14,196
What's the matter with you people?!

620
00:38:19,542 --> 00:38:20,600
What's shaking?

621
00:38:20,810 --> 00:38:22,971
-Captain Riggs.
-Captain Murtaugh.

622
00:38:23,179 --> 00:38:25,807
You're supposed to turn around.
We're captains.

623
00:38:26,015 --> 00:38:28,006
Heard you're up to your ass
in Chinese.

624
00:38:28,218 --> 00:38:30,482
The taller ones come up to the navel.

625
00:38:30,753 --> 00:38:32,618
Big enough to kick your ass.

626
00:38:32,856 --> 00:38:34,153
What can l do for you?

627
00:38:34,357 --> 00:38:37,758
One of the ship's crew shot an illegal,
apparently under orders...

628
00:38:37,961 --> 00:38:40,191
...and we'd dearly like to know...

629
00:38:40,396 --> 00:38:41,829
...who's smuggling Chinese?

630
00:38:42,098 --> 00:38:45,829
We got no hard evidence but we're pretty
sure the big boss is Benny Chan.

631
00:38:46,102 --> 00:38:47,228
Uncle Benny?

632
00:38:47,437 --> 00:38:48,904
You know him?

633
00:38:49,305 --> 00:38:52,172
-When he was running smack.
-We never nailed him.

634
00:38:52,375 --> 00:38:53,603
Benny's slippery.

635
00:38:53,977 --> 00:38:55,501
Where's he hang out?

636
00:38:55,712 --> 00:38:57,907
He's got a nightclub,
couple restaurants.

637
00:38:58,114 --> 00:39:01,515
He operates mainly out on
North Broadway. Here's the address.

638
00:39:03,253 --> 00:39:04,413
Hi, fellas.

639
00:39:05,722 --> 00:39:07,883
There he is. Hey, Burger. Summers.

640
00:39:08,091 --> 00:39:09,251
Butters!

641
00:39:09,826 --> 00:39:11,589
What you got on the freighter homicide?

642
00:39:11,794 --> 00:39:15,890
l talked to some illegals. Turns out
they only knew the shooter by sight.

643
00:39:16,099 --> 00:39:17,396
Checked out the boat.

644
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:21,127
The boat is registered under a dummy
corporation out of lndonesia.

645
00:39:21,337 --> 00:39:24,238
lt'll be a rough one to crack,
but we'll nail them.

646
00:39:24,440 --> 00:39:26,305
You ever hear of Benny Chan?

647
00:39:26,509 --> 00:39:28,807
Benny Chan. No.
What kind of bad man is he?

648
00:39:29,012 --> 00:39:31,003
Real bad. Big crime boss in Chinatown.

649
00:39:31,214 --> 00:39:33,910
lf it's dirty and it's Chinese,
Benny's doing it.

650
00:39:34,117 --> 00:39:35,607
So where do l find him?

651
00:39:36,119 --> 00:39:37,245
At his restaurant.

652
00:39:37,453 --> 00:39:39,921
l'm kind of hungry for Chinese.
How about you?

653
00:39:40,123 --> 00:39:42,353
We're going there anyway.
We'll drive you.

654
00:39:43,126 --> 00:39:44,684
Just let me get my jacket.

655
00:39:45,128 --> 00:39:46,095
Not with him.

656
00:39:46,296 --> 00:39:47,763
-He's doing good.
-l know.

657
00:39:47,964 --> 00:39:51,866
We might need backup. Spend some time
with him. You might learn to love him.

658
00:39:53,136 --> 00:39:54,626
Like a son.

659
00:39:55,138 --> 00:39:56,230
ln-law-enforcement.

660
00:39:56,439 --> 00:39:59,704
lt pays to know your fellow officer.
He might have to back you up one day.

661
00:40:05,548 --> 00:40:09,314
Sir, let me just say, it'll be an honor
to share some egg rolls with you.

662
00:40:09,652 --> 00:40:11,176
Yeah, all right. Let's go.

663
00:40:11,387 --> 00:40:12,376
Let's go.

664
00:40:12,722 --> 00:40:13,848
Share?

665
00:40:15,725 --> 00:40:19,058
So, Butters, it seems like you hate
crime in a sort of personal way...

666
00:40:19,262 --> 00:40:20,593
...if you don't mind me saying.

667
00:40:20,997 --> 00:40:22,464
Why so you say that, sir?

668
00:40:22,665 --> 00:40:26,260
Last night l noticed you were,
let's say, more than slightly miffed.

669
00:40:26,469 --> 00:40:28,994
-Wasn't he, Roger?
-Hell, yeah.

670
00:40:29,205 --> 00:40:30,365
Any particular reason?

671
00:40:30,606 --> 00:40:32,938
About 1 50,000 of them.

672
00:40:33,142 --> 00:40:36,578
That's how many bullets were zinging
around my neighborhood growing up.

673
00:40:36,779 --> 00:40:39,680
Couldn't go outside.
Couldn't go near a window.

674
00:40:39,882 --> 00:40:44,216
Lived on the floor, ate on the floor,
slept and watched TV on the floor.

675
00:40:44,687 --> 00:40:46,951
l didn't learn to walk till
l was 1 0.

676
00:40:47,523 --> 00:40:50,890
Spent most of my formative years
nose-to-nose with the family beagle.

677
00:40:51,694 --> 00:40:53,161
When l'm working on a crime...

678
00:40:53,396 --> 00:40:54,988
...l ain't thinking about the crime.

679
00:40:55,198 --> 00:40:58,565
l'm thinking about that goddamn
floor and it pisses me off.

680
00:41:02,372 --> 00:41:04,704
We supposed to be
meeting Leo somewhere?

681
00:41:04,907 --> 00:41:05,999
No, why?

682
00:41:06,209 --> 00:41:08,404
Because he's following us.
Don't look.

683
00:41:08,978 --> 00:41:10,002
Who's Leo?

684
00:41:10,213 --> 00:41:11,544
Maybe it's a coincidence.

685
00:41:11,948 --> 00:41:15,247
-What does he want?
-l don't know. Let's find out.

686
00:41:24,527 --> 00:41:26,518
-Fucking asshole!
-Bite me!

687
00:41:26,729 --> 00:41:28,526
Bite me, okay? Whatever! Whatever!

688
00:41:29,465 --> 00:41:30,727
Jerk!

689
00:41:31,734 --> 00:41:32,996
You looking for us, Leo?

690
00:41:33,336 --> 00:41:35,770
-You saw me, huh?
-Yeah, we saw you.

691
00:41:36,139 --> 00:41:37,333
What you doing, Leo?

692
00:41:37,540 --> 00:41:40,737
l'm perfecting my tailing technique
now that l'm a Pl.

693
00:41:41,344 --> 00:41:44,336
He's a private eyesore.
Nice inconspicuous vehicle.

694
00:41:44,547 --> 00:41:45,536
l like it.

695
00:41:46,749 --> 00:41:48,216
Riggs, who's the perp?

696
00:41:48,484 --> 00:41:50,679
-What'd you bust him for?
-l'm a perp?

697
00:41:50,887 --> 00:41:53,947
A young brother in a police car is
automatically a perp?

698
00:41:54,557 --> 00:41:58,049
Look at my suit! My tie! Do l look
like the Crips' accountant?

699
00:41:58,895 --> 00:42:00,385
Look at this badge, bitch!

700
00:42:00,596 --> 00:42:01,563
Check out the gun.

701
00:42:01,831 --> 00:42:04,026
-License! Registration!
-Put the gun down!

702
00:42:04,233 --> 00:42:05,564
License! Registration!

703
00:42:06,169 --> 00:42:07,193
Urine sample!

704
00:42:07,403 --> 00:42:08,665
l got a badge too, okay?

705
00:42:08,871 --> 00:42:11,362
German Jews didn't have it any
easier as kids!

706
00:42:11,674 --> 00:42:13,505
So don't think you're the only one.

707
00:42:13,709 --> 00:42:15,438
Besides, l knew you were a cop!

708
00:42:15,678 --> 00:42:18,078
l was kidding!
l can smell a cop a mile away!

709
00:42:18,781 --> 00:42:20,408
You saying l smell bad?

710
00:42:20,683 --> 00:42:23,117
Don't turn everything around!
You're so touchy.

711
00:42:23,786 --> 00:42:26,254
These guys'll tell you.
We got a history.

712
00:42:26,689 --> 00:42:30,022
Maybe we'll work together someday!
l'm the bomb! They'll tell you!

713
00:42:30,293 --> 00:42:34,093
We'll work together soon as l open up a
cereal shop, you fucking leprechaun!

714
00:42:34,297 --> 00:42:36,788
l didn't call you names, fuckface!
Don't start!

715
00:42:37,066 --> 00:42:38,727
Okay?! Don't fool around!

716
00:42:39,202 --> 00:42:40,669
These guys'll tell you.

717
00:42:40,870 --> 00:42:42,394
Sir, you're double-parked.

718
00:42:42,705 --> 00:42:45,435
Officer, l'm just talking
with the detectives.

719
00:42:45,808 --> 00:42:47,036
We don't know this guy.

720
00:42:48,277 --> 00:42:49,539
Think he was drinking.

721
00:42:49,812 --> 00:42:51,439
They're kidding. Come back!

722
00:42:52,315 --> 00:42:54,283
l wasn't drinking!
They just said that.

723
00:42:54,484 --> 00:42:55,815
Blow your breath in my hand.

724
00:42:56,018 --> 00:42:57,815
Now hold on, l can smell it already.

725
00:42:58,087 --> 00:42:59,714
Blow in my fucking ear!

726
00:43:00,623 --> 00:43:01,954
No, you're all mine.

727
00:43:02,158 --> 00:43:03,216
-You're mine.
-Whatever.

728
00:43:30,353 --> 00:43:31,547
Where's Uncle Benny?

729
00:43:32,188 --> 00:43:33,849
-He's not here.
-ls he in there?

730
00:43:34,056 --> 00:43:35,455
-l'm sure he is.
-This way.

731
00:43:35,658 --> 00:43:37,148
Yes, it's a two-way.

732
00:43:37,360 --> 00:43:39,328
Look, please. We have 3 people.

733
00:43:39,662 --> 00:43:42,722
The restaurant's over there.
Let's go this way, please.

734
00:43:42,932 --> 00:43:44,991
They can see us, but we can't see them.

735
00:43:45,368 --> 00:43:47,859
-Where's your green card?
-That's a racist remark.

736
00:43:48,137 --> 00:43:50,765
l'm a policeman who asked
you about your green card.

737
00:43:50,973 --> 00:43:52,065
This is not the way.

738
00:43:52,275 --> 00:43:54,743
You're the boss till we
get up in his ass.

739
00:43:57,480 --> 00:43:59,812
lt'll be fine. They've refurbished.

740
00:44:00,316 --> 00:44:02,147
-l couldn't stop them.
-How you doing?

741
00:44:02,485 --> 00:44:05,010
-Out, out!
-Can l get some drink or food?

742
00:44:05,254 --> 00:44:09,281
Uncle Benny, l hope this is a bad time.
He still hasn't clipped his eyebrows.

743
00:44:09,492 --> 00:44:10,982
What'd we tell you about that?

744
00:44:11,294 --> 00:44:12,921
We hate not disturbing you.

745
00:44:13,129 --> 00:44:15,097
-This is Detective Buckles.
-Whatever.

746
00:44:15,298 --> 00:44:19,496
Sell any heroin? Buy any cops? lKill
anyone lately? How's the restaurant?

747
00:44:19,802 --> 00:44:20,962
Have something to eat.

748
00:44:21,237 --> 00:44:23,330
Give you the police discount.

749
00:44:23,539 --> 00:44:25,439
-Flied lice?
-Flied lice?

750
00:44:25,641 --> 00:44:27,632
lt is fried rice, you plick!

751
00:44:31,147 --> 00:44:33,308
l'm very busy. What is it this time?

752
00:44:34,217 --> 00:44:35,445
Tell him, Buttkiss.

753
00:44:35,651 --> 00:44:39,212
lKnow anything about a boatload of
illegals that went aground last night?

754
00:44:39,922 --> 00:44:41,617
Just what l saw on the news.

755
00:44:41,824 --> 00:44:43,792
Some snakehead lost big money.

756
00:44:43,993 --> 00:44:46,655
400 people at 35 grand.
Fourteen million.

757
00:44:47,997 --> 00:44:50,124
And missed out on making them slaves.

758
00:44:50,333 --> 00:44:54,599
You are cops. l thought smuggling
Chinese was an lNS problem.

759
00:44:54,937 --> 00:44:58,202
We found 3 bodies full of holes,
so now it's a cop problem.

760
00:44:58,407 --> 00:44:59,840
Three dead Chinese?

761
00:45:00,243 --> 00:45:02,006
Billion more where they came from.

762
00:45:02,245 --> 00:45:03,576
That's right. Life's cheap.

763
00:45:03,779 --> 00:45:07,078
The problem is, he shot at me and Rog
too, and that pisses us off.

764
00:45:07,550 --> 00:45:08,812
Too bad they missed.

765
00:45:09,452 --> 00:45:11,147
But still l don't know
anything about it.

766
00:45:13,422 --> 00:45:14,354
Who's he?

767
00:45:17,360 --> 00:45:19,385
Doesn't look too happy.
What's his name?

768
00:45:19,695 --> 00:45:23,062
Who's this guy? ls he appraising
your furniture, or what?

769
00:45:23,266 --> 00:45:24,961
He doesn't speak English.

770
00:45:25,601 --> 00:45:29,196
Then he doesn't understand words
like ''scumbag'' ...

771
00:45:29,872 --> 00:45:31,203
...''eat shit''?

772
00:45:32,608 --> 00:45:34,769
l think he understands good.

773
00:45:39,615 --> 00:45:42,277
-Enter the drag queen.
-The insurance, remember?

774
00:45:42,585 --> 00:45:45,179
l'm busy.
lf you have nothing on me, get out.

775
00:45:45,655 --> 00:45:47,179
Just know we're still around.

776
00:45:47,623 --> 00:45:48,920
l'm on your ass too.

777
00:45:49,892 --> 00:45:51,587
But the door is this way!

778
00:45:51,994 --> 00:45:54,519
This is quicker.
This is quicker, really.

779
00:45:58,067 --> 00:45:59,466
See? lt's quicker!

780
00:46:01,404 --> 00:46:04,237
Don't forget my
1 0% policeman's discount.

781
00:46:06,909 --> 00:46:08,399
You in Hong lKong...

782
00:46:08,744 --> 00:46:10,473
...you'd be dead.

783
00:46:12,481 --> 00:46:14,278
No, not that! No, Riggs! Don't!

784
00:46:16,619 --> 00:46:18,280
The insurance....
What the hell?

785
00:46:25,428 --> 00:46:26,895
Hurry up! Hurry up!

786
00:46:27,096 --> 00:46:30,725
You got to try it sometime. Not only
is it satisfying, it's therapeutic.

787
00:46:30,933 --> 00:46:34,027
-lt saves the cost of a shrink--
-And bad guys can't call the cops.

788
00:46:34,236 --> 00:46:36,670
-Why not? We're already here!

801
00:47:41,537 --> 00:47:42,902

Riggs, don't jump!
You're going to be a father!

817
00:49:42,024 --> 00:49:43,218
Don't jump, damn it!

00:49:48,964 --> 00:49:50,090

Make up your mind!

835
00:50:22,331 --> 00:50:24,128
You couldn't find something smaller?!

Ass first! lt breaks the fall!

00:50:32,708 --> 00:50:33,697
One!

841
00:50:33,909 --> 00:50:35,968
Two! Three! Son of a bitch!

842
00:50:38,013 --> 00:50:39,674
You all right?

843
00:50:39,882 --> 00:50:41,144
l should have had him.

844
00:50:41,350 --> 00:50:43,011
Damn right, you should have!

845
00:50:43,385 --> 00:50:45,114
Who's your partner?

846
00:50:45,421 --> 00:50:47,321
-Son of a bitch!
-l don't have a partner!

847
00:50:47,523 --> 00:50:48,820
The guy you ran with!

848
00:50:49,024 --> 00:50:53,290
l'm a waiter. And then you guys
pull a gun, trying to kill me!

849
00:50:53,495 --> 00:50:56,089
And you physically abuse me!
l want my lawyer!

850
00:50:57,199 --> 00:51:01,192
You ain't no waiter! lf you're
a waiter, what's today's special?

851
00:51:02,404 --> 00:51:03,371
What's today?

852
00:51:04,373 --> 00:51:05,362
Wednesday!

853
00:51:06,008 --> 00:51:08,772
Chicken and sweet and sour pork,
barbecue spareribs--

854
00:51:09,011 --> 00:51:10,501
Shut up!

855
00:51:11,246 --> 00:51:12,338
Next time, don't run!

856
00:51:12,548 --> 00:51:15,210
-Stay still!
-l should've got him!

857
00:51:15,417 --> 00:51:16,941
Johnnie Cochran!

858
00:51:17,152 --> 00:51:18,710
He fight for me!

859
00:52:14,910 --> 00:52:18,573
Mao began helping in the fields
when he was 6 years old.

860
00:52:18,781 --> 00:52:22,080
He led a rebellion early
against his domineering father.

861
00:52:22,418 --> 00:52:25,910
Finally, Mao left home to
continue his schooling.

862
00:52:26,288 --> 00:52:30,657
Those were troubled times. Old China
dissolved in a welter of unrest....

863
00:52:31,493 --> 00:52:32,790
Sorry, Sergeant Murtaugh.

864
00:52:32,995 --> 00:52:34,292
No, no, no, sit, please.

865
00:52:34,496 --> 00:52:36,088
And it's Roger.

866
00:52:36,832 --> 00:52:37,799
lt's your chair.

867
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:40,127
No, sit down, really. lt's fine. Sit.

868
00:52:40,335 --> 00:52:41,734
Want something to drink?

869
00:52:41,937 --> 00:52:42,995
Tequila?

870
00:52:43,839 --> 00:52:45,204
Thank you so much.

00:52:45,474 --> 00:52:46,998

872
00:52:48,343 --> 00:52:51,506
This can't be the first time
you had tequila, Hong.

873
00:52:51,714 --> 00:52:52,703
Yes, yes.

00:53:01,223 --> 00:53:02,315
Toast, toast!

877
00:53:02,524 --> 00:53:03,957
Yeah, yeah, toast.

878
00:53:04,326 --> 00:53:05,315
Bread!

879
00:53:10,899 --> 00:53:12,560
You know anybody here?

880
00:53:12,835 --> 00:53:14,029
My uncle.

881
00:53:14,303 --> 00:53:16,965

882
00:53:17,239 --> 00:53:18,900

...he's artist.

887
00:53:28,884 --> 00:53:30,181
An artist?

888
00:53:33,255 --> 00:53:35,189
lt ought to be tough
leaving home, huh?

889
00:53:38,594 --> 00:53:40,186
ln America...

890
00:53:40,763 --> 00:53:43,527
...my children have chance
to make good life.

891
00:53:44,066 --> 00:53:46,796
We want the best for our children.

892
00:53:47,002 --> 00:53:49,402
And our grandchildren!

893
00:53:49,905 --> 00:53:52,203
You believe l'm a grandfather?

894
00:53:52,407 --> 00:53:54,341
That's right! Little Ping!

895
00:53:55,010 --> 00:53:56,568
You're a grandpa!

896
00:53:57,880 --> 00:53:59,404
Where does the time go?

897
00:54:01,350 --> 00:54:02,476
Don't know.

898
00:54:02,684 --> 00:54:04,083
Have no watch.

899
00:54:04,286 --> 00:54:05,685
You have no watch?

900
00:54:06,088 --> 00:54:07,350
Here.

901
00:54:07,589 --> 00:54:10,080
This is my pop's. Here, take it.

902
00:54:10,292 --> 00:54:12,988
He got it when he retired
from the force. Here.

903
00:54:13,195 --> 00:54:14,924
No, no. No, l cannot.

904
00:54:15,364 --> 00:54:16,763

905
00:54:16,965 --> 00:54:20,594

911
00:56:10,812 --> 00:56:11,870
Get him!

912
00:56:15,250 --> 00:56:16,842
What's wrong?

913
00:56:17,052 --> 00:56:19,350
-Are you okay?
-lt's the shoulder.

914
00:56:19,554 --> 00:56:23,217
lt's an old shoulder injury. l'm going
to have to toss in the towel.

915
00:56:23,425 --> 00:56:25,859
-No problem.
-lt happens periodically.

916
00:56:26,061 --> 00:56:28,621
-ls he okay?
-l was just getting going too.

917
00:56:28,830 --> 00:56:29,956
You're lucky, kid.

918
00:56:30,165 --> 00:56:33,225
-You're lucky he didn't kill you.
-You owe me a rematch!

919
00:56:33,435 --> 00:56:36,029
-Anytime you want.
-l might even train for it.

920
00:56:36,238 --> 00:56:38,502
Better bring your own paramedic too.

921
00:56:40,509 --> 00:56:43,501
-l'll get some ice for that shoulder.
-The shoulder's okay.

922
00:56:43,946 --> 00:56:45,914
There's nothing wrong with my shoulder.

923
00:56:49,051 --> 00:56:50,678
l was faking it.

924
00:56:51,186 --> 00:56:52,585
Faking it?

925
00:56:53,689 --> 00:56:57,682
Gomez was killing me out there.
l didn't have anything left.

926
00:56:57,926 --> 00:56:59,723
l told you that kid was good.

927
00:56:59,928 --> 00:57:02,761
He's good but it's not all him.

928
00:57:04,066 --> 00:57:08,196
l mean, l've been feeling it lately.
You know the other....

929
00:57:14,109 --> 00:57:17,078
Like the other night on the ship
when that guy nailed me.

930
00:57:17,279 --> 00:57:19,713
And yesterday l couldn't catch him.

931
00:57:20,082 --> 00:57:23,074
l just thought, you know,
l'm out of shape or something.

932
00:57:23,285 --> 00:57:26,015
You know. But it's more than that.

933
00:57:26,221 --> 00:57:27,347
lt's like....

934
00:57:27,556 --> 00:57:31,492
-l hate to say this but--
-You're getting too old for this shit.

935
00:57:37,566 --> 00:57:39,090
How about that?

936
00:57:39,801 --> 00:57:40,790
Finally.

937
00:57:41,737 --> 00:57:44,228
No, but l can't be. l mean,
l'm only....

938
00:57:45,974 --> 00:57:48,135
-Jesus.
-Yeah, you're only.

939
00:57:49,978 --> 00:57:51,969
Can't beat the clock, Riggs.

940
00:57:54,516 --> 00:57:57,815
Murphy's right. We're dinosaurs.
What am l going to do?

941
00:57:58,520 --> 00:57:59,646
Accept it.

942
00:58:02,591 --> 00:58:03,819
Like l do.

943
00:58:06,128 --> 00:58:07,595
No. Bullshit.

944
00:58:08,263 --> 00:58:09,628
Bullshit. l won't accept it.

945
00:58:09,831 --> 00:58:13,323
-l'll will it not to happen.
-Will it? You're going to will it?

946
00:58:13,535 --> 00:58:15,332
l'm not too old for this shit.

947
00:58:15,537 --> 00:58:19,598
l'm not too old for this shit.
We're not too old for this shit.

948
00:58:19,941 --> 00:58:22,967
We're not too old for this shit.
We're not too old for--

949
00:58:23,178 --> 00:58:24,440
Say it like you believe it.

950
00:58:24,646 --> 00:58:26,807
We're not too old for this shit.

951
00:58:27,983 --> 00:58:30,474
l'm not going to buy
a hemorrhoid cushion.

952
00:58:30,819 --> 00:58:33,151
-l'm not going to get corns!
-l got corns!

953
00:58:33,355 --> 00:58:36,085
-l'm not wearing a suit!
-What's wrong with a suit?

954
00:58:37,192 --> 00:58:38,625
How's it going, Captain?

955
00:58:49,304 --> 00:58:51,295
Thanks a lot, you guys.
Very funny.

956
00:58:51,506 --> 00:58:53,701
That cop tried to strip-search me!

957
00:58:53,909 --> 00:58:55,638
-You get his phone number?
-Funny.

958
00:58:55,844 --> 00:58:57,175
Sugar-glazed with jelly.

959
00:58:57,379 --> 00:58:58,471
Thanks, Leo.

960
00:58:58,680 --> 00:59:00,671
-What happened? The scratches.
-A dog.

961
00:59:01,083 --> 00:59:03,779
-A dog?
-Catch you drinking out of his bowl?

962
00:59:03,985 --> 00:59:06,215
l'm working on an important Pl case.

963
00:59:06,421 --> 00:59:07,581
Did the dog hire you?

964
00:59:07,789 --> 00:59:11,190
No, the dog didn't hire me.
The people that lost the dog hired me.

965
00:59:11,393 --> 00:59:12,451
Sounds like a big case.

966
00:59:12,661 --> 00:59:15,789
lt is a big case, Mr. Big Shot,
for all you know.

967
00:59:15,997 --> 00:59:17,191
lt's an expensive dog.

968
00:59:17,432 --> 00:59:19,332
-A Bolshoi.
-Borzoi.

969
00:59:19,534 --> 00:59:20,933
Whatever, whatever.

970
00:59:21,436 --> 00:59:22,994
And you found it, huh?

971
00:59:23,205 --> 00:59:25,867
Sort of. Okay, listen to what happens.

972
00:59:26,441 --> 00:59:30,502
lnstead of going around town looking
for a dog, l went to the pound.

973
00:59:30,712 --> 00:59:34,671
l take the dog home. l dye the dog,
it looks exactly like their dog.

974
00:59:34,883 --> 00:59:36,350
Dog was a real rat, though.

975
00:59:36,551 --> 00:59:38,519
He scratched me.
But l got the job done.

976
00:59:38,720 --> 00:59:40,813
Some kind of Pl business
you got there.

977
00:59:41,022 --> 00:59:43,013
Douche Ventura, pet infective.

978
00:59:43,225 --> 00:59:44,522
lt's grand theft.

979
00:59:44,726 --> 00:59:46,921
-What is?
-With trickery and device, felony.

980
00:59:47,129 --> 00:59:48,096
lt is?

981
00:59:48,296 --> 00:59:49,923
You guys are always kidding.

982
00:59:50,132 --> 00:59:53,124
Whatever. l get it.
Here comes that touchy kid.

983
00:59:53,368 --> 00:59:54,335
l'm not here.

984
00:59:55,637 --> 00:59:56,467
What, Putter?

985
00:59:56,905 --> 00:59:58,031
The guy you chased?

986
00:59:59,441 --> 01:00:03,036
The gun he dropped matched slugs on the
bodies on the boat. He's your shooter.

987
01:00:05,046 --> 01:00:06,536
Son of a bitch got away from me.

988
01:00:06,748 --> 01:00:07,715
He didn't get far.

989
01:00:07,916 --> 01:00:11,716
They found him on a rooftop nearby.
Strangled. And get this:

990
01:00:11,920 --> 01:00:13,251
Pigeons ate his eyeballs.

991
01:00:14,489 --> 01:00:15,456
Cool.

992
01:00:16,091 --> 01:00:17,490
Excuse me.

993
01:00:20,162 --> 01:00:23,859
Shit! l hate these fucking phones!
You get a call, they cut you off.

994
01:00:24,065 --> 01:00:26,556
You make a call, they cut you off.
What's the point?

995
01:00:26,801 --> 01:00:30,100
Don't you know what they're doing?
They fuck you with cell phones.

996
01:00:30,305 --> 01:00:33,763
They're fucking you with the cell phone.
They love when you get cut off.

997
01:00:33,975 --> 01:00:37,001
Because when you call back,
they charge you...

998
01:00:37,212 --> 01:00:39,578
...for that first minute again
at that high rate.

999
01:00:39,781 --> 01:00:41,942
lf you're able to call back...

1000
01:00:42,150 --> 01:00:45,608
...because the 3-hour battery you
got only lasts 20 fucking minutes.

1001
01:00:45,820 --> 01:00:47,754
lf you're behind a hill, it goes....

1002
01:00:47,989 --> 01:00:49,957
Or you're going through a damn tunnel.

1003
01:00:50,158 --> 01:00:51,887
And they keep making it smaller!

1004
01:00:52,093 --> 01:00:54,755
You know why? So you can lose it.

1005
01:00:55,096 --> 01:00:58,293
Why? So you buy more phones.
l never lost my mother's phone!

1006
01:00:58,500 --> 01:01:01,094
Take you two hours to make
a long-distance call.

1007
01:01:01,303 --> 01:01:03,703
Duh-duh-duh-duh-4.
Duh-duh-duh-duh-5.

1008
01:01:04,506 --> 01:01:07,964
l messed up! Hang up. Got to
do it again. Duh-duh-duh-duh-4....

1009
01:01:09,110 --> 01:01:11,510
Never lost my Sports Illustrated
swimsuit phone.

1010
01:01:11,713 --> 01:01:15,547
How about scanners? They get your phone
number and call all over the world!

1011
01:01:16,451 --> 01:01:19,943
Somebody took my number and called
Afghanistan! Afghanistan!

1012
01:01:20,722 --> 01:01:24,317
l don't know what fucking
Afghanistan look like.

1013
01:01:24,526 --> 01:01:28,587
Even if l did, l would not talk
to their Afghan ass for 3 hours!

1014
01:01:28,797 --> 01:01:30,992
l won't talk to my daddy for 3 hours!

1015
01:01:31,199 --> 01:01:33,997
They fuck you, they fuck you
with the cell phones!

1016
01:01:34,202 --> 01:01:37,137
You know when you go to a drive-through?
Hold on.

1017
01:01:37,339 --> 01:01:38,738
Why am l talking--?

1018
01:01:40,041 --> 01:01:41,599
Leo Getz, private investigator.

1019
01:01:41,810 --> 01:01:43,141
Private investigator?

1020
01:01:43,345 --> 01:01:46,542
l wondered if you'd be willing
to investigate my privates.

1021
01:01:47,482 --> 01:01:48,779
lnvestigate what?

1022
01:01:48,984 --> 01:01:50,542
My privates, you stupid shit.

1023
01:01:50,752 --> 01:01:52,481
Shut the fuck up.

1024
01:01:52,887 --> 01:01:55,355
Very funny.
You're costing me money here.

1025
01:01:55,857 --> 01:01:58,951
$3 to answer a call.
They're fucking me, now you are.

1026
01:01:59,160 --> 01:02:02,687
-You're pretty tough on the phone.
-That's right. Telephone tough guy.

1027
01:02:02,897 --> 01:02:06,663
-Why am l talking to you on the phone?
-Get the fuck out of here. Go home.

1028
01:02:07,002 --> 01:02:08,560
What happened to your face?

1029
01:02:09,070 --> 01:02:10,503
''No'' means no!

1030
01:02:13,908 --> 01:02:15,876
The kid's going to like me,
l can tell.

1031
01:02:16,077 --> 01:02:17,374
He'd be the first one.

1032
01:02:20,181 --> 01:02:22,012
Whatever. Whatever.

1033
01:02:26,788 --> 01:02:29,780
You know, we should hire Leo.

1034
01:02:30,425 --> 01:02:31,392
Hire Leo?

1035
01:02:31,593 --> 01:02:33,584
He could follow Uncle Benny around.

1036
01:02:33,795 --> 01:02:35,524
-Benny'll see him.
-That's the idea.

1037
01:02:35,797 --> 01:02:37,856
-He'll drive him nuts.
-Benny'll shoot him.

1038
01:02:40,735 --> 01:02:41,702
Let's hire him!

1039
01:02:42,404 --> 01:02:44,429
l smell like stale coffee.

1040
01:02:47,876 --> 01:02:50,674
What do you care if l go home
and change my shirt?

1041
01:02:50,879 --> 01:02:54,144
A coffee stain's not something
that would bother me.

1042
01:02:54,349 --> 01:02:55,680
Look at the way you dress.

1043
01:02:56,551 --> 01:02:57,950
What's that supposed to mean?

1044
01:03:00,221 --> 01:03:03,349
Just because l don't get around in
nifty suits like you. Not many cops do.

1045
01:03:03,558 --> 01:03:05,287
What's that supposed to mean?

1046
01:03:07,429 --> 01:03:10,626
l've been wondering,
where's the money coming from?

1047
01:03:11,733 --> 01:03:13,701
Where do you think it's coming from?

1048
01:03:13,902 --> 01:03:16,029
-Where do you think?
-l don't know.

1049
01:03:16,237 --> 01:03:19,138
-lt's none of my damn business.
-You don't know.

1050
01:03:19,441 --> 01:03:22,239
-Trish gave me some money.
-lt's none of my business.

1051
01:03:22,444 --> 01:03:25,572
Trish gave me some money, and
from my Aunt Anne who died.

1052
01:03:26,081 --> 01:03:27,844
All right. Okay, sorry.

1053
01:03:30,852 --> 01:03:32,046
Whose car is that?

1054
01:03:33,054 --> 01:03:34,248
l don't know.

1055
01:03:34,889 --> 01:03:37,756
lt looks like a full house
for Lamaze class.

1056
01:03:37,959 --> 01:03:39,187
You know that car?

1057
01:03:39,394 --> 01:03:41,123
Here you go, Captains.

1058
01:03:42,797 --> 01:03:44,059
No charge for the ride.

1059
01:03:44,799 --> 01:03:46,699
Rianne's here and Lorna's here.

1060
01:03:46,901 --> 01:03:49,267
l'll put it on your account, Captain.

1061
01:03:54,075 --> 01:03:55,064
Hey, honey.

1062
01:03:55,577 --> 01:03:58,171
What's going on?
l came home to change my shirt--

1063
01:04:03,885 --> 01:04:04,817
Why are you here?

1064
01:04:05,153 --> 01:04:06,484
They took the Hongs.

1065
01:04:14,763 --> 01:04:15,752
Shit.

1066
01:04:17,098 --> 01:04:18,360
Drop it.

1067
01:04:32,647 --> 01:04:33,511
Girls, get out!

1068
01:04:39,120 --> 01:04:40,815
Look who we got here.

1069
01:04:41,022 --> 01:04:42,990
-Uncle Benny's friend.
-Hey, Bruce.

1070
01:04:43,958 --> 01:04:45,448
Nice pajamas.

1071
01:04:47,228 --> 01:04:48,320
Where are the Hongs?

1072
01:04:57,238 --> 01:04:58,569
Drop your guns.

1073
01:04:59,140 --> 01:05:01,233
-Drop them!
-Okay, take it easy!

1074
01:05:01,943 --> 01:05:03,376
Don't stand for that, honey.

1075
01:05:11,753 --> 01:05:12,583
Son of a bitch!

1076
01:06:45,680 --> 01:06:47,375
Let the women go.

1077
01:07:07,302 --> 01:07:08,997
l can't breathe!

1078
01:07:40,134 --> 01:07:41,362
Son of a bitch!

1079
01:08:04,325 --> 01:08:05,815
l'll be damned! Thanks, kid!

1080
01:08:11,332 --> 01:08:12,924
Ping, cut us loose, cut us loose.

1081
01:08:19,574 --> 01:08:20,666
Cut me loose, Ping!

1082
01:08:22,944 --> 01:08:24,468
Go ahead, cut me.

1083
01:08:24,679 --> 01:08:26,010
Cut me.

1084
01:09:06,688 --> 01:09:07,882
lt's all right.

1085
01:09:09,223 --> 01:09:10,588
You okay, honey?

1086
01:09:10,892 --> 01:09:12,792
l owe you one, kid.

1087
01:09:13,294 --> 01:09:15,194
The keys to your car.

1088
01:09:15,396 --> 01:09:17,694
-They're in the car.
-l got car.

1089
01:09:17,899 --> 01:09:18,991
We need a radio.

1090
01:09:23,671 --> 01:09:25,036
We have to go, baby.

1091
01:09:25,306 --> 01:09:26,136
Let's go.

1092
01:09:26,674 --> 01:09:30,269
How are we going to find them?
We got to catch them assholes!

1093
01:09:36,718 --> 01:09:39,209
3-William-56, this is Air 12, go ahead.

1094
01:09:39,420 --> 01:09:40,717
We need your eyes, guys.

1095
01:09:41,022 --> 01:09:44,355
We're looking for a black Mercedes
and a black Lincoln Continental.

1096
01:09:44,559 --> 01:09:47,289
Vicinity of Ladera at the 210 freeway.

1097
01:09:47,495 --> 01:09:49,827
Black Mercedes and black
Continental, huh?

1098
01:09:50,031 --> 01:09:52,522
Shouldn 't be too hard
to find in this town.

1099
01:09:52,734 --> 01:09:55,464
Look, just give it a shot,
will you, guys?

1100
01:09:55,670 --> 01:09:56,694
Be cooperative.

1101
01:09:56,904 --> 01:09:57,871
That's a roger.

1102
01:10:08,316 --> 01:10:09,943
Will wonders never cease?

1103
01:10:10,151 --> 01:10:14,110
We've got 2 black Mercedes, one heading
east, one heading west.

1104
01:10:14,856 --> 01:10:17,188
Eastbound one got on the
Valley View ramp.

1105
01:10:17,492 --> 01:10:18,459
East, okay.

1106
01:10:18,659 --> 01:10:20,854
We'll take it.
Locate the Continental.

1107
01:10:21,062 --> 01:10:21,960
Roger.

1108
01:10:22,163 --> 01:10:24,256
-ls that the right one?
-l don't know.

1109
01:10:24,465 --> 01:10:26,524
But we're going east and China's east.

1110
01:10:26,734 --> 01:10:27,598
China's west too.

1111
01:10:27,802 --> 01:10:29,929
-We can't divide.
-l'll think positive.

1112
01:10:34,776 --> 01:10:35,936
You crossed two lanes!

1113
01:10:36,277 --> 01:10:37,266
Do you see him?

1114
01:10:44,752 --> 01:10:46,117
Watch the road!

1115
01:10:46,921 --> 01:10:48,946
l'd give my right arm for a siren!

1116
01:10:53,194 --> 01:10:55,128
Why'd they take the Hongs anyway?

1117
01:10:55,429 --> 01:10:58,125
Maybe they're shaking them down
for more money.

1118
01:11:01,402 --> 01:11:02,801
Hong's uncle paid already.

1119
01:11:03,104 --> 01:11:04,969
He got in touch with his uncle.

1120
01:11:05,306 --> 01:11:08,503
He left a message for him.
That's how they know where l live.

1121
01:11:08,810 --> 01:11:09,640
Out of the way!

1122
01:11:14,949 --> 01:11:16,177
Go, go, go!

1123
01:11:18,219 --> 01:11:21,120
There it is! There's the son of a bitch
right there!

1124
01:11:21,389 --> 01:11:24,415
Bastards left us to burn!
l want to have a chat with them!

1125
01:11:24,725 --> 01:11:26,056
You don't have any guns!

1126
01:11:26,260 --> 01:11:28,319
Get me right up behind this trailer.

1127
01:11:28,529 --> 01:11:29,587
But you're driving!

1128
01:11:29,797 --> 01:11:30,661
You're driving!

1129
01:11:30,865 --> 01:11:33,265
There's cruise control!
Just steer!

1130
01:11:33,568 --> 01:11:35,661
Why you always make shit complicated?!

1131
01:11:43,778 --> 01:11:44,642
Closer.

1132
01:11:44,946 --> 01:11:46,379
Don't be shy. Get up there.

1133
01:11:46,681 --> 01:11:47,943
You crazy son of a bitch!

1134
01:11:48,349 --> 01:11:50,146
Closer! Closer!

1135
01:11:50,451 --> 01:11:51,577
That's it!

1136
01:12:07,001 --> 01:12:07,831
Thanks.

1137
01:12:25,286 --> 01:12:26,776
Hey, asshole! Come on in!

1138
01:12:30,124 --> 01:12:32,592
l need to ask you.
Where's the Hongs?

1139
01:13:07,261 --> 01:13:08,285
Where's the Hongs?

1140
01:13:08,629 --> 01:13:09,561
Where are they?

1141
01:13:13,167 --> 01:13:14,225
Fuck!

1142
01:13:16,737 --> 01:13:17,726
Come on, get him!

1143
01:13:24,312 --> 01:13:25,142
Watch out!

1144
01:13:47,468 --> 01:13:49,299
Highway Patrol, this is William-356...

1145
01:13:49,603 --> 01:13:51,264
...heading southbound on highway!

1146
01:13:51,772 --> 01:13:53,603
Officer in trouble!
Oversized trailer.

1147
01:13:55,776 --> 01:13:57,869
LAPD! Pull over! LAPD!

1148
01:13:58,713 --> 01:14:00,271
LAPD! Pull over!

1149
01:14:04,151 --> 01:14:05,709
Pull over! See that?!

1150
01:14:06,087 --> 01:14:07,611
Right! Fuck you!

1151
01:14:07,922 --> 01:14:08,820
Shit!

1152
01:14:09,223 --> 01:14:12,886
Anybody there? l got a crazy ass with a
phony badge trying to pull me over!

1153
01:14:37,018 --> 01:14:38,645
Get away from my boy!

1154
01:14:56,003 --> 01:14:56,935
Son of a bitch!

1155
01:15:00,274 --> 01:15:01,172
l got you!

1156
01:15:06,380 --> 01:15:07,210
Hold on!

1157
01:15:10,618 --> 01:15:12,142
Get in!
Come on, get in here!

1158
01:15:20,995 --> 01:15:21,859
Get in here!

1159
01:15:22,063 --> 01:15:22,893
Shit!

1160
01:15:23,397 --> 01:15:24,386
Ready?

1161
01:15:29,804 --> 01:15:31,965
-Welcome back. Shit.
-What a drag.

1162
01:15:32,173 --> 01:15:33,231
Thanks, Rog.

1163
01:15:33,774 --> 01:15:36,572
-What about the Hongs?
-We'll ask the other guy. Go!

1164
01:15:46,320 --> 01:15:48,220
Pull over! Pull over!
Son of a bitch!

1165
01:15:54,228 --> 01:15:55,923
lKeep your hands inside then!

1166
01:16:20,955 --> 01:16:22,081
Get out of the way!

1167
01:16:23,757 --> 01:16:25,418
Wait! There he is!
There he is!

1168
01:16:25,626 --> 01:16:26,923
-lKeep going!
-l'm going.

1169
01:16:46,647 --> 01:16:47,841
We're gaining on him.

1170
01:16:48,082 --> 01:16:49,379
Don't worry, l got him.

1171
01:16:53,387 --> 01:16:54,251
Son of a bitch!

1172
01:17:14,475 --> 01:17:17,740
-You okay?
-Yeah, l think my heart's still beating.

1173
01:17:25,119 --> 01:17:27,087
Maybe a little too close.

1174
01:17:31,492 --> 01:17:34,188
You are now entering an
international holding area.

1175
01:17:34,495 --> 01:17:37,157
Please have proper documentation ready.

1176
01:20:21,495 --> 01:20:23,053
Sorry, Rog, about your loss.

1177
01:20:23,330 --> 01:20:24,262
Thank you, man.

1178
01:20:25,933 --> 01:20:27,127
How's my hero?

1179
01:20:27,468 --> 01:20:30,904
He's a little bit sad.
He's talking about his mom and dad.

1180
01:20:35,109 --> 01:20:36,474
Here's Butters.

1181
01:20:41,081 --> 01:20:42,378
How's it going, Riggs?

1182
01:20:42,616 --> 01:20:43,605
Why are you here?

1183
01:20:43,817 --> 01:20:45,114
l heard it on the radio.

1184
01:20:45,753 --> 01:20:47,721
l'm really sorry about your house.

1185
01:20:49,890 --> 01:20:51,687
This is Detective....

1186
01:20:51,959 --> 01:20:52,891
Butters.

1187
01:20:53,293 --> 01:20:55,488
-Trish, my wife.
-How you doing, Trish?

1188
01:20:55,696 --> 01:20:56,685
Nick.

1189
01:20:56,897 --> 01:20:57,955
Carrie.

1190
01:20:58,298 --> 01:20:59,094
Rianne.

1191
01:20:59,600 --> 01:21:00,498
Everybody okay?

1192
01:21:02,603 --> 01:21:04,332
You get a make on who did this?

1193
01:21:04,705 --> 01:21:05,933
lt was Uncle Benny.

1194
01:21:09,109 --> 01:21:12,101
-Who's Leo? The little Fonzie guy?
-You got a phone?

1195
01:21:12,379 --> 01:21:13,607
That's him.

1196
01:21:14,715 --> 01:21:17,013
-You be okay?
-Yeah, we'll be all right.

1197
01:21:17,718 --> 01:21:18,650
Call me.

1198
01:21:18,919 --> 01:21:21,114
The kids have their place.
Rianne has hers.

1199
01:21:21,555 --> 01:21:22,715
He's there?

1200
01:21:23,023 --> 01:21:24,513
We'll be right there.

1201
01:21:24,825 --> 01:21:27,259
We'll be right there.
Can you drive us?

1202
01:21:27,561 --> 01:21:28,619
Yeah, let's do it.

1203
01:21:29,329 --> 01:21:30,193
l'll call you.

1204
01:21:35,569 --> 01:21:36,866
Man, sit down.

1205
01:21:43,343 --> 01:21:44,469
Captain Murtaugh...

1206
01:21:44,978 --> 01:21:46,946
...l know this is a bad time...

1207
01:21:47,247 --> 01:21:48,145
...but...

1208
01:21:48,582 --> 01:21:50,812
...l think there's something
you need to know about me.

1209
01:21:51,618 --> 01:21:54,678
-This is hard for me to--
-l think maybe l know what it is.

1210
01:21:54,988 --> 01:21:56,046
You do?

1211
01:21:57,491 --> 01:21:59,152
lt's okay.

1212
01:21:59,960 --> 01:22:01,052
lt is?

1213
01:22:01,495 --> 01:22:06,364
People have the right to do what makes
them happy. Don't expect me to like it.

1214
01:22:06,967 --> 01:22:08,901
l know this must be real hard for you.

1215
01:22:09,203 --> 01:22:10,431
lt's impossible for me!

1216
01:22:11,839 --> 01:22:15,570
l was hoping we could get together
around the holidays, say Christmas.

1217
01:22:15,843 --> 01:22:20,075
Why the hell should we get together and
see each other on Christmas?

1218
01:22:20,614 --> 01:22:22,980
-l'm trying to reach out.
-Reach somewhere else.

1219
01:22:23,283 --> 01:22:25,774
Do what you want,
but leave me out of it.

1220
01:22:26,019 --> 01:22:28,715
-l got it.
-l don't want to hear no more about it.

1221
01:22:29,022 --> 01:22:30,216
Not a word.

1222
01:22:30,524 --> 01:22:34,824
What you grinning about?
Think about how we can talk to Benny.

1223
01:22:35,128 --> 01:22:36,686
l got it all worked out.

1224
01:22:37,698 --> 01:22:39,256
What's the matter with you?

1225
01:22:39,867 --> 01:22:43,200
My ass hurts. My tooth! ls this
a dentist's office or a proctologist's?

1226
01:22:43,604 --> 01:22:46,232
-Just please be quiet.
-l'm trying! l'm in pain!

1227
01:22:46,540 --> 01:22:49,202
Why don't you go see your
own dentist and be quiet?!

1228
01:22:49,643 --> 01:22:52,134
My dentist is in Detroit or l would go!

1229
01:22:52,412 --> 01:22:55,006
-Oh, brother.
-Oh brother, your ass! Get the dentist!

1230
01:22:56,049 --> 01:22:58,813
Doctor, l'm sorry to bother you.
We have an emergency.

1231
01:22:59,019 --> 01:23:03,718
A man walked in off the street.
He's in a lot of pain. You better come.

1232
01:23:08,228 --> 01:23:10,128
Okay, you can come in now!

1233
01:23:19,139 --> 01:23:22,734
-You sure Leo can pull this off?
-Leo's got a B.S. in B.S.

1234
01:23:24,745 --> 01:23:26,144
Coast is clear.

1235
01:23:28,048 --> 01:23:30,073
Talk to the hand, okay?
One second.

1236
01:23:30,751 --> 01:23:32,275
Okay, okay. Wait a minute.

1237
01:23:32,586 --> 01:23:34,053
Let me. Let me do my job!

1238
01:23:34,354 --> 01:23:37,323
You hurt me, l'll stick an egg roll
right up your ass.

1239
01:23:44,064 --> 01:23:46,123
-What's this?
-Don't be alarmed.

1240
01:23:46,333 --> 01:23:47,357
lt's only a drill.

1241
01:23:47,601 --> 01:23:48,659
Don't say a word.

1242
01:23:49,069 --> 01:23:49,967
Shut up.

1243
01:23:50,270 --> 01:23:51,134
Now....

1244
01:23:51,471 --> 01:23:54,929
Where are the Hongs?
Open wide and tell me.

1245
01:23:55,275 --> 01:23:56,469
l don't know any Hongs.

1246
01:23:56,710 --> 01:23:59,474
You do. Their uncle paid you to
get them out of China.

1247
01:23:59,680 --> 01:24:01,875
More smuggling?
We went through that.

1248
01:24:02,082 --> 01:24:03,413
Let's go through it again.

1249
01:24:03,717 --> 01:24:05,309
-Come on.
-l have nothing to say.

1250
01:24:05,619 --> 01:24:07,109
These look very interesting.

1251
01:24:07,955 --> 01:24:09,422
You're not going to use it.

1252
01:24:09,723 --> 01:24:11,088
You won't shoot me.

1253
01:24:11,325 --> 01:24:13,520
-You're lousy cops.
-We're good cops. Here.

1254
01:24:16,096 --> 01:24:17,495
This'll settle him down.

1255
01:24:17,764 --> 01:24:19,493
Breathe, Uncle Benny. Breathe.

1256
01:24:19,800 --> 01:24:20,926
Breathe.

1257
01:24:21,134 --> 01:24:22,294
Crank up the nitrous.

1258
01:24:23,103 --> 01:24:24,161
Crank that baby up.

1259
01:24:24,504 --> 01:24:26,301
You said it wasn't going to hurt!

1260
01:24:26,573 --> 01:24:28,040
l'm holding this. Go ahead.

1261
01:24:28,642 --> 01:24:30,906
Deep. Right down to your toes.
Thataboy.

1262
01:24:37,117 --> 01:24:37,981
He's wasted!

1263
01:24:38,318 --> 01:24:40,377
-Great, great.
-Have some more.

1264
01:24:40,721 --> 01:24:42,518
He'll talk. Yeah, he'll talk.

1265
01:24:42,823 --> 01:24:44,916
Thataboy. Breathe.

1266
01:24:48,662 --> 01:24:50,425
-That's me.
-That's you.

1267
01:24:52,766 --> 01:24:54,927
Now, where are the Hongs?

1268
01:24:58,438 --> 01:25:00,929
-What's renminbi mean?
-Renminbi means...

1269
01:25:01,375 --> 01:25:02,205
...renminbi.

1270
01:25:02,542 --> 01:25:05,443
-You're a funny guy.
-This guy's wasting our time.

1271
01:25:05,946 --> 01:25:06,776
Time!

1272
01:25:07,280 --> 01:25:09,373
-Time for Four Fathers!
-Forefathers!

1273
01:25:09,583 --> 01:25:11,380
Washington, Jefferson, those guys?

1274
01:25:11,618 --> 01:25:12,550
Roosevelt?

1275
01:25:13,687 --> 01:25:16,019
l'm sleeping with my wife's 2 sisters.

1276
01:25:16,456 --> 01:25:17,650
You lucky son of a bitch.

1277
01:25:17,958 --> 01:25:19,255
That's a good one.

1278
01:25:20,027 --> 01:25:21,358
Not so good...

1279
01:25:21,628 --> 01:25:23,562
...when my wife finds out.

1280
01:25:25,699 --> 01:25:26,757
l don't need needles!

1281
01:25:27,034 --> 01:25:28,433
l don't need needles!

1282
01:25:30,704 --> 01:25:35,368
Let's shoot his legs with Novocain
and watch him try to get out of here.

1283
01:25:38,211 --> 01:25:39,439
What you got there?

1284
01:25:41,314 --> 01:25:42,212
A nut cup.

1285
01:25:43,450 --> 01:25:45,213
l got some big nuts!

1286
01:25:48,188 --> 01:25:49,587
That's nitro--

1287
01:25:50,223 --> 01:25:51,622
Oxide!

1288
01:25:52,592 --> 01:25:54,025
Laughing gas!

1289
01:25:54,327 --> 01:25:56,124
We're stoned!

1290
01:26:00,400 --> 01:26:02,095
Murtaugh! Hurry up!

1291
01:26:02,402 --> 01:26:05,394
That's one funny son-in-law
you got there, Rog.

1292
01:26:06,239 --> 01:26:07,797
After tonight, it be too late.

1293
01:26:08,008 --> 01:26:09,635
Too late? Too late for what?

1294
01:26:12,079 --> 01:26:13,944
Why did you call him my son-in-law?

1295
01:26:14,214 --> 01:26:16,114
Who? Uncle Benny? He's far too old.

1296
01:26:16,349 --> 01:26:17,247
Old coot.

1297
01:26:18,251 --> 01:26:21,311
Buy Four Fathers back at
Four Fathers' store.

1298
01:26:22,122 --> 01:26:23,851
Why's he talking about his ancestors?

1299
01:26:24,524 --> 01:26:26,014
l don't know.

1300
01:26:26,626 --> 01:26:28,856
Why you call him my son-in-law?

1301
01:26:29,429 --> 01:26:30,623
Because l am!

1302
01:26:36,103 --> 01:26:37,502
l thought he was....

1303
01:26:40,440 --> 01:26:41,839
No, l'm....

1304
01:26:44,444 --> 01:26:45,433
Bloody marvelous!

1305
01:26:46,046 --> 01:26:49,174
Your baby is having my baby.

1306
01:26:49,950 --> 01:26:52,885
My baby is having his baby.

1307
01:26:53,253 --> 01:26:55,687
And your baby?
Whoa, baby!

1308
01:26:55,989 --> 01:26:57,513
Whoa, baby! My baby!

1309
01:26:58,558 --> 01:27:00,458
What's going on?
What are you doing?

1310
01:27:00,660 --> 01:27:02,457
l couldn't stall anymore.

1311
01:27:03,797 --> 01:27:05,560
What happened? Huh?

1312
01:27:06,266 --> 01:27:08,962
-What's going on?
-Rog, look at this. Does that hurt?

1313
01:27:10,737 --> 01:27:12,796
Riggs, get out! Fine!

1314
01:27:13,106 --> 01:27:14,198
Whatever!

1315
01:27:18,578 --> 01:27:22,480
Anything happens to the Hongs we'll
come back and rip you a new one.

1316
01:27:22,749 --> 01:27:24,512
A new one. That's two for Benny.

1317
01:27:24,818 --> 01:27:26,683
Bloody marvelous.

1318
01:27:30,190 --> 01:27:31,350
What are you, crazy?

1319
01:27:31,691 --> 01:27:32,919
What'd you do that for?

1320
01:27:33,193 --> 01:27:35,093
For keeping it from me.

1321
01:27:35,362 --> 01:27:36,226
Hit him, not me.

1322
01:27:36,530 --> 01:27:40,694
As soon as we find the Hongs, me, you
and Rianne is getting into this.

1323
01:29:28,875 --> 01:29:30,399
Rimminy?

1324
01:29:30,744 --> 01:29:33,907
A young bimbo? A young jumping jiminy?
l don't know.

1325
01:29:35,015 --> 01:29:36,414
I can't remember.

1326
01:29:36,850 --> 01:29:38,613
No, Riggs. Renminbi .

1327
01:29:39,019 --> 01:29:40,145
Say that again.

1328
01:29:40,520 --> 01:29:41,612
That's it!

1329
01:29:41,922 --> 01:29:42,820
You got it.

1330
01:29:43,023 --> 01:29:44,718
Means, ''people's money. ''

1331
01:29:45,025 --> 01:29:46,049
People's money?

1332
01:29:46,293 --> 01:29:47,624
What else did Benny say?

1333
01:29:47,861 --> 01:29:51,820
He was talking about his ancestor.
About buying him back.

1334
01:29:52,098 --> 01:29:53,963
And something about how tonight's...

1335
01:29:54,267 --> 01:29:55,962
...too late.
Mean anything to you?

1336
01:29:56,236 --> 01:29:57,430
No, nothing at all.

1337
01:29:57,704 --> 01:29:59,831
What about the guy
who torched my house?

1338
01:30:00,040 --> 01:30:01,905
lt was like Benny
was afraid of him.

1339
01:30:02,242 --> 01:30:05,075
If Benny's scared of him,
he's got to be a Chinese Triad.

1340
01:30:05,512 --> 01:30:07,946
Those guys'll kill anyone
who gets in their way.

1341
01:30:08,148 --> 01:30:08,978
lncluding cops...

1342
01:30:09,249 --> 01:30:12,082
...and their families.
So watch your asses, all right?

1343
01:30:12,385 --> 01:30:13,943
-Thanks, Ng.
-lKeep me posted.

1344
01:30:15,188 --> 01:30:17,656
Pick up your wife, my daughter.
Make sure she's safe.

1345
01:30:17,891 --> 01:30:20,189
l'll get Trish, you get Lorna.
Her and Ping.

1346
01:31:24,024 --> 01:31:24,956
What?

1347
01:31:26,326 --> 01:31:28,021
You want to get married, don't you?

1348
01:31:29,963 --> 01:31:30,952
No.

1349
01:31:35,735 --> 01:31:37,828
Yes. Yes, l do.

1350
01:31:38,638 --> 01:31:40,731
But if you don't want to, it's okay.

1351
01:31:41,808 --> 01:31:43,400
Why didn't you tell me?

1352
01:31:43,643 --> 01:31:46,339
Because l didn't want to put
any pressure on you.

1353
01:31:46,546 --> 01:31:48,980
lf you want to someday, that'd be great.

1354
01:31:50,750 --> 01:31:52,047
lf you don't...

1355
01:31:52,652 --> 01:31:53,983
...l love you.

1356
01:31:58,058 --> 01:32:00,356
l'll take you any way l can get you.

1357
01:32:06,366 --> 01:32:07,492
Feel that!

1358
01:32:09,169 --> 01:32:11,160
Feel the baby!
He's really dancing.

1359
01:32:11,371 --> 01:32:12,963
He's kicking. You feel him?

1360
01:32:30,623 --> 01:32:31,453
Hang on!

1361
01:33:02,822 --> 01:33:03,652
You're okay.

1362
01:33:03,857 --> 01:33:05,484
Riggs. Pick up, Riggs.

1363
01:33:05,692 --> 01:33:07,455
Riggs, it's Murtaugh.

1364
01:33:08,528 --> 01:33:12,089
l'm sick of these fuckers.
l say we just find them and shoot them.

1365
01:33:12,298 --> 01:33:15,233
-What do you think?
-Meet me and Butters on South Spring.

1366
01:33:15,435 --> 01:33:16,527
What's going on?

1367
01:33:18,905 --> 01:33:20,896
They found my watch.

1368
01:33:24,477 --> 01:33:28,243
They killed Hong, his uncle,
Uncle Benny too. Bodies are in there.

1369
01:33:28,448 --> 01:33:30,973
-Where's the rest of the family?
-They're okay.

1370
01:33:31,751 --> 01:33:35,243
lNS raided a Chinese sweatshop.

1371
01:33:35,922 --> 01:33:40,256
Hong's family was being held there
and they led them back here.

1372
01:33:41,861 --> 01:33:43,726
They were making funny money.

1373
01:33:43,930 --> 01:33:45,488
lnk's still wet.

1374
01:33:46,132 --> 01:33:47,258
Where are the faces?

1375
01:33:47,467 --> 01:33:48,991
That's why l called it funny.

1376
01:33:49,602 --> 01:33:51,570
Why are they making Chinese money?

1377
01:33:51,771 --> 01:33:53,739
Can they even exchange the stuff here?

1378
01:33:53,940 --> 01:33:54,929
Only in China.

1379
01:33:55,275 --> 01:33:56,606
-Renminbi .
-l remember.

1380
01:33:58,611 --> 01:34:02,274
Hong's uncle was an artist.
Maybe an engraver.

1381
01:34:02,482 --> 01:34:06,418
Bringing over his family could've
been how he was paid to do the job.

1382
01:34:06,619 --> 01:34:08,143
-That sounded thin.
-lt's not.

1383
01:34:08,354 --> 01:34:09,685
lKeep talking. What?

1384
01:34:10,023 --> 01:34:13,186
Benny said something about paying...

1385
01:34:13,493 --> 01:34:15,290
...buying back his forefathers.

1386
01:34:15,528 --> 01:34:16,517
What'd you say?

1387
01:34:17,530 --> 01:34:20,988
Benny said something about buying
back his forefathers.

1388
01:34:21,201 --> 01:34:22,930
You said ancestors.

1389
01:34:23,136 --> 01:34:25,001
What's the difference?

1390
01:34:25,205 --> 01:34:28,231
The number four.
Four Fathers.

1391
01:34:28,441 --> 01:34:30,932
They were the top guys
of the Hong lKong Triad.

1392
01:34:31,144 --> 01:34:35,171
-These guys disappeared from prison.
-Reds jailed them when they took over.

1393
01:34:35,381 --> 01:34:37,611
-l bet you they're here.
-Damn, we're good.

1394
01:34:37,817 --> 01:34:40,718
Grab Ping. l don't want him
to see the bodies.

1395
01:34:43,990 --> 01:34:46,185
1 0 to 1 , l know where the money is.

1396
01:34:46,392 --> 01:34:47,859
20 to 1 ,
l know where the Four Fathers are.

1397
01:34:48,328 --> 01:34:49,352
Let me make a call.

1398
01:34:49,729 --> 01:34:50,855
Don't leave without us.

1399
01:34:51,531 --> 01:34:53,965
That was good work.
You must be a detective.

1400
01:34:54,167 --> 01:34:55,930
l have my moments.

1401
01:35:02,175 --> 01:35:03,369
Uncle Benny.

1402
01:35:03,943 --> 01:35:06,537
l was actually starting
to like the old goat.

1403
01:35:06,746 --> 01:35:08,338
''Bloody marvelous.''

1404
01:35:08,548 --> 01:35:10,675
And it's fried rice, ''you plick.''

1405
01:35:11,951 --> 01:35:12,747
Here.

1406
01:35:19,025 --> 01:35:21,687
-Which one is Hong?
-Hong's right in front of you.

1407
01:35:22,562 --> 01:35:25,087
l want a complete set of forensics
on all three.

1408
01:35:29,235 --> 01:35:31,362
Dads and their kids.

1409
01:35:34,240 --> 01:35:36,037
l'll take care of yours, buddy.

1410
01:35:36,976 --> 01:35:37,908
We got to go!

1411
01:35:38,111 --> 01:35:39,373
Take care of yourself.

1412
01:35:39,579 --> 01:35:40,511
Where're we going?

1413
01:35:40,713 --> 01:35:42,647
-L.A. Harbor.
-What's there?

1414
01:35:42,849 --> 01:35:47,252
lt's a foreign trade zone. A lot of
deals go down with the Chinese military.

1415
01:35:47,787 --> 01:35:50,187
It's run by a corrupt Chinese general.

1416
01:35:50,423 --> 01:35:55,326
I got it, some corrupt Chinese general
brought the Four Fathers here...

1417
01:35:55,528 --> 01:35:57,496
...and the Triad's
buying their release.

1418
01:35:57,697 --> 01:36:00,325
That's what Uncle Benny meant
by buying them back.

1419
01:36:00,533 --> 01:36:03,900
That general'll be shitting kittens
when he sees the money's counterfeit.

1420
01:36:04,103 --> 01:36:05,730
Let's tell him.

1421
01:36:48,281 --> 01:36:49,839
Hi, gang.

1422
01:36:50,049 --> 01:36:51,277
LAPD.

1423
01:36:55,355 --> 01:36:56,845
l saw Hong.

1424
01:36:57,357 --> 01:37:01,987
This is what Benny meant by buying the
Four Fathers. Harpo, Groucho, Chico...

1425
01:37:02,195 --> 01:37:04,356
...and Fucko.
How are you, boys?

1426
01:37:04,664 --> 01:37:05,926
Who's the naughty general?

1427
01:37:06,132 --> 01:37:08,191
Who's been lining his pockets?

1428
01:37:08,468 --> 01:37:09,662
Naughty.

1429
01:37:10,303 --> 01:37:11,270
Speaky English?

1430
01:37:13,206 --> 01:37:14,195
What do you want?

1431
01:37:15,708 --> 01:37:16,697
See this?

1432
01:37:16,976 --> 01:37:20,969
l hope you need a lot of toilet paper
because that's all it's good for.

1433
01:37:21,180 --> 01:37:22,272
Wiping your ass.

1434
01:37:22,482 --> 01:37:25,349
Take the Four Pops back to China.
We don't give a shit.

1435
01:37:25,551 --> 01:37:26,540
The Four Pops.

1436
01:37:27,620 --> 01:37:28,917
Don't want them no more.

1437
01:37:29,122 --> 01:37:30,020
lt's counterfeit.

1438
01:37:30,223 --> 01:37:32,714
Triads never prosper when they
cheat a general.

1439
01:37:34,727 --> 01:37:36,194
See for yourself.

1440
01:37:47,940 --> 01:37:51,000
There you go. Money losing face.
General losing face.

1441
01:37:51,210 --> 01:37:53,906
Very hard when Triad tried to sit on it.

1442
01:37:56,916 --> 01:37:59,043
l fucked you. l fucked you.

1443
01:37:59,552 --> 01:38:00,576
We fucked you.

1444
01:38:00,787 --> 01:38:03,051
-We fucked you. lt's beautiful.
-Beautiful.

1445
01:38:05,558 --> 01:38:06,923
Don't we get a hand?

1446
01:38:17,537 --> 01:38:19,869
lKeep your head down!
Let them shoot each other!

1447
01:38:20,072 --> 01:38:21,232
Watch out!

1448
01:38:23,643 --> 01:38:24,632
Thanks!

1449
01:38:36,422 --> 01:38:37,548
Was this a good idea?

1450
01:38:37,757 --> 01:38:38,951
lt was an idea!

1451
01:38:45,965 --> 01:38:49,298
-1 1 in the mag, 1 in the pipe. You?
-Wheel gun. 6 shots.

1452
01:38:51,804 --> 01:38:52,634
Four!

1453
01:39:00,112 --> 01:39:02,205
What's going on?
Why are you lying to me?

1454
01:39:03,850 --> 01:39:05,681
lA says you're on the take.

1455
01:39:05,885 --> 01:39:07,182
l'm on the take?!

1456
01:39:07,386 --> 01:39:10,514
l think it's crazy too! But you're
spending a lot of money!

1457
01:39:10,790 --> 01:39:12,587
You ever hear of Ebony Clark?

1458
01:39:13,693 --> 01:39:16,856
Yeah! She writes those cheesy
sex novels!

1459
01:39:17,797 --> 01:39:18,991
Are you boinking her?

1460
01:39:19,198 --> 01:39:22,292
No, l'm not boinking Ebony Clark, Riggs.
Shit!

1461
01:39:22,535 --> 01:39:24,298
Trish is Ebony Clark.

1462
01:39:27,039 --> 01:39:28,028
You're boinking her!

1463
01:39:30,676 --> 01:39:32,007
Yeah, l'm boinking her.

1464
01:39:45,825 --> 01:39:47,656
l'm too embarrassed
to tell anybody.

1465
01:39:47,894 --> 01:39:49,486
Yeah, l don't blame you.

1466
01:39:50,229 --> 01:39:51,218
How many you got?

1467
01:39:51,430 --> 01:39:53,057
Two.

1468
01:39:53,900 --> 01:39:55,424
l'll look for some more ammo.

1469
01:40:26,198 --> 01:40:27,688
Who's that in white pajamas?

1470
01:40:28,267 --> 01:40:31,100
Wah Sing lKu. The Four Father
with him is his older brother.

1471
01:40:31,304 --> 01:40:32,464
No kidding.

1472
01:40:36,609 --> 01:40:37,473
Captain!

1473
01:40:42,281 --> 01:40:44,340
-Hey, Butters.
-Shit! Shit!

1474
01:40:44,684 --> 01:40:46,151
Now you got my name right.

1475
01:40:46,719 --> 01:40:48,744
l'm out. l got to find some rounds.

1476
01:40:49,488 --> 01:40:51,080
l'll help you.

1477
01:40:52,158 --> 01:40:53,716
Never been shot before.

1478
01:40:57,697 --> 01:40:59,130
Take care of my son-in-law.

1479
01:41:46,245 --> 01:41:49,146
-You all right?
-No. l got my ass kicked again.

1480
01:41:49,348 --> 01:41:50,838
Shit, l'm out. l'm out.

1481
01:41:51,617 --> 01:41:54,950
l hit the son of a bitch. l thought
l missed him. Where'd they go?

1482
01:42:07,199 --> 01:42:08,359
Come on, come on.

1483
01:42:08,567 --> 01:42:09,556
Go.

1484
01:42:10,369 --> 01:42:12,633
We got Door Number 1 ,
Number 2, or Number 3.

1485
01:42:15,975 --> 01:42:18,375
-Looks like Number 2, Monty.
-Let's go.

1486
01:42:23,449 --> 01:42:26,384
What's behind Door Number 2?
Bingo.

1487
01:42:34,393 --> 01:42:35,985
Now you've done it.

1488
01:42:36,328 --> 01:42:37,886
Now he's really pissed.

1489
01:42:42,835 --> 01:42:45,201
Son of a bitch is going to be a handful.

1490
01:42:49,909 --> 01:42:54,403
Since l met you, l've done some
hairy shit. But this won't happen.

1491
01:42:55,614 --> 01:42:57,343
l'm going to be a grandfather...

1492
01:42:57,616 --> 01:42:59,607
...and you and Lorna will have a baby.

1493
01:43:03,622 --> 01:43:06,557
He ain't worth dying for, Riggs.
He ain't worth it.

1494
01:43:09,228 --> 01:43:10,923
Yeah, you're right.

1495
01:43:13,099 --> 01:43:17,468
And if he gets away we can track him
down later with a howitzer or something.

1496
01:43:17,670 --> 01:43:22,437
Your son-in-law's bleeding. We should
get him and go. lt's raining and....

1497
01:43:23,042 --> 01:43:24,703
l'm too old for this shit too.

1498
01:43:25,644 --> 01:43:27,043
Guy's too damn good.

1499
01:43:27,780 --> 01:43:30,874
Yeah, he's good. How'd he do that
thing with the gun?

1500
01:43:31,250 --> 01:43:34,777
He took my gun apart with one deft move.
How did he do that?

1501
01:43:37,890 --> 01:43:38,720
How?

1502
01:43:47,666 --> 01:43:49,065
Yeah, okay.

1503
01:43:49,502 --> 01:43:50,560
Let's go ask him.

1504
01:47:42,034 --> 01:47:43,296
Are you up there?

1505
01:47:44,169 --> 01:47:45,295
Are you all right?

1506
01:48:22,207 --> 01:48:23,936
Where are you, Riggs?

1507
01:48:24,143 --> 01:48:26,202
Will it to me, Riggs!

1508
01:48:27,780 --> 01:48:29,077
Where are you?

1509
01:48:29,281 --> 01:48:30,578
Will it to me!

1510
01:48:32,985 --> 01:48:34,680
Will me, Riggs, will me.

1511
01:48:34,887 --> 01:48:39,790
You going to have a baby. Will me,
you son of a bitch. God! Will me!

1512
01:48:45,898 --> 01:48:46,956
l hear you, Riggs.

1513
01:48:47,166 --> 01:48:48,224
l hear you.

1514
01:48:48,634 --> 01:48:49,760
l got you.

1515
01:48:49,968 --> 01:48:50,957
l'm coming!

1516
01:49:41,820 --> 01:49:43,879
l heard you, Riggs! l heard you!

1517
01:49:45,224 --> 01:49:47,488
You willed me to it!
You willed me, baby!

1518
01:49:47,726 --> 01:49:49,523
What took you so long?

1519
01:49:49,728 --> 01:49:52,822
What took me so long?!
What the hell do you think?!

1520
01:49:53,031 --> 01:49:54,692
l was knocked down over here!

1521
01:49:54,900 --> 01:49:56,458
l couldn't even get up!

1522
01:49:59,304 --> 01:50:00,464
Come back here!

1523
01:50:03,675 --> 01:50:05,472
Let's go home, man.

1524
01:50:06,378 --> 01:50:08,039
Let's get out of here.

1525
01:50:13,752 --> 01:50:17,244
l haven't been here enough
lately, Vicki. l'm sorry.

1526
01:50:18,857 --> 01:50:21,849
l need to talk to you about Lorna.
Me and Lorna.

1527
01:50:24,863 --> 01:50:27,730
lt's like this.
She wants to get married...

1528
01:50:29,501 --> 01:50:32,732
...and l love her.
l won't lie to you. l do.

1529
01:50:33,405 --> 01:50:35,873
And l want to make her happy.

1530
01:50:38,177 --> 01:50:40,338
l'm looking for help here, honey.

1531
01:50:42,347 --> 01:50:43,871
l don't know what to do.

1532
01:50:45,417 --> 01:50:47,715
Funny talking to you about
this stuff--

1533
01:50:52,524 --> 01:50:54,617
You want to get yourself shot?

1534
01:50:57,429 --> 01:50:59,556
What the hell are you doing here?

1535
01:51:00,199 --> 01:51:01,325
l was tailing you.

1536
01:51:02,701 --> 01:51:03,690
Sorry.

1537
01:51:06,939 --> 01:51:09,931
l'll leave you alone, okay?
l guess you want to be alone.

1538
01:51:10,442 --> 01:51:11,841
l appreciate it.

1539
01:51:16,748 --> 01:51:17,908
When l was a kid...

1540
01:51:18,150 --> 01:51:19,378
...l had a pet frog.

1541
01:51:19,818 --> 01:51:20,648
What?

1542
01:51:21,787 --> 01:51:24,449
Just give me a second.
Let me tell you this, okay?

1543
01:51:24,790 --> 01:51:27,657
l had this pet frog.
His name was Froggy.

1544
01:51:27,960 --> 01:51:29,860
He was my best friend in the world.

1545
01:51:30,762 --> 01:51:32,252
l didn't have lots of friends.

1546
01:51:32,564 --> 01:51:33,462
Matter of fact...

1547
01:51:33,966 --> 01:51:35,866
...l had no friends...

1548
01:51:36,335 --> 01:51:37,529
...and...

1549
01:51:38,804 --> 01:51:40,863
...l used to kiss the frog too.

1550
01:51:41,406 --> 01:51:43,203
l thought maybe...

1551
01:51:43,942 --> 01:51:47,275
...it would turn into a princess
since l was a boy...

1552
01:51:47,579 --> 01:51:49,137
...and it could be...

1553
01:51:49,414 --> 01:51:50,642
...my mother.

1554
01:51:51,583 --> 01:51:53,016
They told me that she...

1555
01:51:53,352 --> 01:51:54,751
...left or something.

1556
01:51:55,587 --> 01:51:57,817
And my father was no bargain.

1557
01:51:58,357 --> 01:52:00,018
And so, just the frog.

1558
01:52:00,359 --> 01:52:02,020
Froggy was my friend.

1559
01:52:02,361 --> 01:52:05,159
l really loved him and
l took him everywhere with me.

1560
01:52:05,764 --> 01:52:07,698
And l was riding on my bike one day...

1561
01:52:08,000 --> 01:52:10,230
...and he jumped out of the box...

1562
01:52:10,435 --> 01:52:12,403
...and l ran him over
with the back tire.

1563
01:52:13,105 --> 01:52:14,367
l killed him.

1564
01:52:15,173 --> 01:52:17,767
l was really heartbroken. Really.

1565
01:52:18,844 --> 01:52:21,574
He was my best friend,
the only thing l ever loved.

1566
01:52:23,015 --> 01:52:24,846
And then l met you...

1567
01:52:25,183 --> 01:52:26,480
...and Roger.

1568
01:52:26,785 --> 01:52:30,448
And you guys really looked after me
a lot more than you really had to.

1569
01:52:30,989 --> 01:52:32,889
l'm terrible to you, Leo.

1570
01:52:33,191 --> 01:52:34,590
No, no, it's okay.

1571
01:52:34,993 --> 01:52:36,187
lt's okay.

1572
01:52:36,528 --> 01:52:38,018
You're my family...

1573
01:52:38,697 --> 01:52:40,255
...and my friends.

1574
01:52:42,467 --> 01:52:45,800
You're not better friends than Froggy.
You're just different.

1575
01:52:49,541 --> 01:52:50,803
And...

1576
01:52:52,544 --> 01:52:55,445
...l just thought that maybe
that might be relevant.

1577
01:53:00,018 --> 01:53:01,713
Okay, l'll leave you alone now.

1578
01:53:05,490 --> 01:53:07,424
l got a funny f--

1579
01:53:07,959 --> 01:53:08,823
What's wrong?!

1580
01:53:09,061 --> 01:53:10,756
l'm having a baby.

1581
01:53:11,063 --> 01:53:12,428
Lorna beeped me.

1582
01:53:12,898 --> 01:53:15,093
Yep, it's Lorna.
She's having the baby.

1583
01:53:15,434 --> 01:53:17,459
-l'll get the car.
-l'll be behind you.

1584
01:53:25,577 --> 01:53:27,909
You sure picked a strange angel, honey.

1585
01:53:30,048 --> 01:53:31,481
But l got the message.

1586
01:53:33,051 --> 01:53:34,450
l got the message.

1587
01:53:40,859 --> 01:53:42,258
l'll always have this.

1588
01:53:43,362 --> 01:53:44,852
Always have you.

1589
01:53:45,464 --> 01:53:46,988
ln here and here.

1590
01:53:48,700 --> 01:53:49,667
Thanks, honey.

1591
01:53:49,935 --> 01:53:51,869
l got to go. Bye.

1592
01:53:52,738 --> 01:53:54,330
l am not ready to have this baby!

1593
01:53:54,673 --> 01:53:57,107
You're as ready as you're going to be.

1594
01:53:57,409 --> 01:53:59,001
Fine! Just wheel me in.

1595
01:53:59,311 --> 01:54:01,370
My legs are staying closed!

1596
01:54:02,414 --> 01:54:03,472
Give me this!

1597
01:54:03,749 --> 01:54:05,273
Now, now, ma'am, let go!

1598
01:54:05,584 --> 01:54:08,553
l am a police officer!
And l am not ready!

1599
01:54:15,293 --> 01:54:16,487
Are you all right?

1600
01:54:16,762 --> 01:54:18,229
-Are you the husband?
-Yes.

1601
01:54:18,430 --> 01:54:19,727
Honey, are you all right?

1602
01:54:19,931 --> 01:54:23,094
No, l'm not. l said l didn't
want to get married but l do.

1603
01:54:23,335 --> 01:54:26,133
l want to be a wife before l'm a mother.
l just lied.

1604
01:54:26,438 --> 01:54:27,700
l know you don't want to.

1605
01:54:29,608 --> 01:54:31,371
-You said ''okay''?
-Yes, l did. Okay.

1606
01:54:31,710 --> 01:54:33,234
Let's do it. Okay.

1607
01:54:34,312 --> 01:54:35,711
He said okay.

1608
01:54:36,181 --> 01:54:38,513
-Congratulations.
-He said okay, Leo.

1609
01:54:38,850 --> 01:54:40,374
Oh, my God.

1610
01:54:40,719 --> 01:54:42,311
What's that smell?

1611
01:54:42,621 --> 01:54:45,215
l was on my way to the toilet
and she grabbed me.

1612
01:54:45,524 --> 01:54:46,821
l'm so sorry.

1613
01:54:47,125 --> 01:54:48,592
Have a nice baby!

1614
01:54:50,462 --> 01:54:51,759
l'm so sorry.

1615
01:54:54,866 --> 01:54:56,197
Will you marry me?

1616
01:55:00,405 --> 01:55:01,372
You bet l will.

1617
01:55:04,543 --> 01:55:05,567
Let's go.

1618
01:55:05,877 --> 01:55:08,277
l'm not going! Wait! No, no, wait!

1619
01:55:08,547 --> 01:55:09,571
Please, Riggs.

1620
01:55:09,881 --> 01:55:11,007
-Get a minister.
-Now?

1621
01:55:11,349 --> 01:55:14,284
Right now. We're getting married.
Here comes another one.

1622
01:55:14,486 --> 01:55:16,420
But we need a license, a blood test--

1623
01:55:16,621 --> 01:55:17,849
Before the baby comes!

1624
01:55:18,056 --> 01:55:18,954
lt's coming now.

1625
01:55:19,391 --> 01:55:22,155
Listen, l am getting married
or there is no baby.

1626
01:55:22,360 --> 01:55:24,851
This could be an aspect
of a transition phase.

1627
01:55:25,063 --> 01:55:28,089
This is no goddamn aspect
of a transition phase!

1628
01:55:28,400 --> 01:55:30,197
Honey, everybody, calm down.

1629
01:55:30,502 --> 01:55:32,060
Calm down. Calm down. Okay?

1630
01:55:32,370 --> 01:55:34,861
-Get a priest, minister, anything.
-Where?

1631
01:55:35,073 --> 01:55:37,598
Leo, go get a priest!
Goddamn it, Leo!

1632
01:55:37,909 --> 01:55:39,604
l got it, l got it. Okay, okay.

1633
01:55:39,911 --> 01:55:41,970
Pant, pant, blow.
Remember Lamaze class?

1634
01:55:42,180 --> 01:55:43,977
Pant, blow. Come on, pant, blow.

1635
01:55:46,251 --> 01:55:47,616
But l want to say ''l do.''

1636
01:55:47,919 --> 01:55:49,716
Here he is. Here he is.

1637
01:55:50,021 --> 01:55:51,386
This is Rabbi Gelb.

1638
01:55:51,690 --> 01:55:52,588
A rabbi?

1639
01:55:52,791 --> 01:55:54,281
You said anything, duh.

1640
01:55:54,593 --> 01:55:55,423
He'll do.

1641
01:55:56,027 --> 01:55:57,654
For what, l'll do? What?

1642
01:55:57,863 --> 01:55:58,887
Marry us.

1643
01:55:59,197 --> 01:56:00,221
-Marry you?
-Please.

1644
01:56:00,432 --> 01:56:02,059
-You're Jewish?
-Not necessarily.

1645
01:56:02,267 --> 01:56:03,666
-You got a license?
-No.

1646
01:56:03,869 --> 01:56:05,666
Rabbi, please don't go.

1647
01:56:06,271 --> 01:56:09,001
She needs to hear the words
before the baby comes.

1648
01:56:09,207 --> 01:56:12,438
Are you both serious about this?
l don't have time for hijinks.

1649
01:56:13,011 --> 01:56:14,444
We're really very serious.

1650
01:56:14,646 --> 01:56:16,671
l could do it.
lt wouldn't be official.

1651
01:56:16,915 --> 01:56:18,542
l just want to hear the words.

1652
01:56:18,884 --> 01:56:20,943
What the hell. What are your names?

1653
01:56:21,253 --> 01:56:22,811
l'm Martin and this is Lorna.

1654
01:56:23,088 --> 01:56:24,521
Martin and Lorna.

1655
01:56:25,457 --> 01:56:28,290
What am l doing?
How do the goyim do this?

1656
01:56:29,561 --> 01:56:30,425
Dearly beloved.

1657
01:56:30,629 --> 01:56:31,527
Dearly beloved.

1658
01:56:31,730 --> 01:56:36,326
Dearly beloved,
marriage is a spiritual unity....

1659
01:56:37,636 --> 01:56:40,662
Faster, faster!
She's heading for the home stretch.

1660
01:56:40,972 --> 01:56:43,270
Martin, will you take
Lorna to be your wife?

1661
01:56:43,508 --> 01:56:46,944
Will you honor, love,
etcetera, etcetera, etcetera...

1662
01:56:47,145 --> 01:56:49,113
-...until death do you part?
-l will.

1663
01:56:49,447 --> 01:56:52,177
Lorna, will you take Martin
to be your husband?

1664
01:56:52,484 --> 01:56:54,952
-Etcetera, etcetera. The same thing.
-l do.

1665
01:56:55,253 --> 01:56:56,584
l pronounce you man and wife.

1666
01:56:56,788 --> 01:56:59,052
You may kiss the bride.
You already did.

1667
01:56:59,257 --> 01:57:01,248
-All right, let's go.
-No, wait, wait!

1668
01:57:01,459 --> 01:57:02,790
Hold it! Hold it!

1669
01:57:03,094 --> 01:57:04,356
What is...?

1670
01:57:04,663 --> 01:57:06,961
l need this! l need this glass!

1671
01:57:07,265 --> 01:57:08,698
-No, goddamn it!
-l need it!

1672
01:57:09,000 --> 01:57:10,058
What are you doing?!

1673
01:57:10,502 --> 01:57:13,403
Talk to the hand, okay?
l'll be right back.

1674
01:57:13,772 --> 01:57:16,798
You know how long it took me
to fill that thing? All day!

1675
01:57:17,108 --> 01:57:20,077
This is unsanitary. What is this?

1676
01:57:20,378 --> 01:57:22,209
-Break it.
-And get piss on my shoes?

1677
01:57:23,014 --> 01:57:24,311
You got to do this!

1678
01:57:25,016 --> 01:57:26,574
-Mazel tov !
-Okay, let's go.

1679
01:57:28,787 --> 01:57:30,880
Come back here,
you little son of a bitch!

1680
01:57:31,189 --> 01:57:32,486
Pant, pant, blow, pant.

1681
01:57:32,691 --> 01:57:34,090
Leo, please.

1682
01:57:35,694 --> 01:57:38,788
Your work is over here now.
l think someone else needs you.

1683
01:57:44,202 --> 01:57:45,931
Good luck, Lorna, Riggs.

1684
01:57:49,908 --> 01:57:51,034
Thanks a lot.

1685
01:57:56,014 --> 01:57:57,572
Stick around. Meet the kid.

1686
01:57:57,916 --> 01:58:00,111
Good luck, Lorna! Okay, okay.

1687
01:58:05,957 --> 01:58:08,118
Here it comes, here it comes.

1688
01:58:10,228 --> 01:58:11,320
Here he is.

1689
01:58:12,063 --> 01:58:15,226
He's looking right at you.
He knows it's you.

1690
01:58:19,971 --> 01:58:21,734
Rog, look what l found.

1691
01:58:22,340 --> 01:58:24,934
-Look at that.
-Boy, what a beauty.

1692
01:58:25,477 --> 01:58:27,138
Look at those eyes!

1693
01:58:27,879 --> 01:58:30,370
-He looks like his mother.
-Yes, he does.

1694
01:58:30,682 --> 01:58:31,774
Murtaugh! Murtaugh!

1695
01:58:34,653 --> 01:58:36,143
-No, Butters!
-That's right.

1696
01:58:36,454 --> 01:58:38,547
Butters' baby. Better not be Murtaugh.

1697
01:58:38,757 --> 01:58:40,349
lt's Butters, Butters, Butters.

1698
01:58:41,760 --> 01:58:43,284
Look at that baby.

1699
01:58:44,162 --> 01:58:45,390
Look at the hair.

1700
01:58:46,665 --> 01:58:48,462
That's my baby!

1701
01:58:48,967 --> 01:58:51,401
Look at her. You're so cute.
Look at you.

1702
01:58:51,870 --> 01:58:54,600
27 people. Nobody thought
of bringing a camera?

1703
01:58:54,806 --> 01:58:56,433
Leo, your plastic's flaccid.

1704
01:58:56,775 --> 01:59:00,267
These machines take your plastic,
they wreck it, then give you the camera.

1705
01:59:00,478 --> 01:59:02,844
The camera doesn't work.
They're trying to--

1706
01:59:03,181 --> 01:59:04,205
No, no, please.

1707
01:59:07,385 --> 01:59:08,784
What you doing here?

1708
01:59:09,521 --> 01:59:11,079
Look at these two babies.

1709
01:59:11,289 --> 01:59:13,519
Just a little something from the squad.

1710
01:59:13,725 --> 01:59:15,454
Thank you.

1711
01:59:16,061 --> 01:59:18,655
-Give me back those captain badges.
-What for?

1712
01:59:18,863 --> 01:59:22,196
Congratulations. You're sergeants
again. The city's self-insured.

1713
01:59:22,400 --> 01:59:24,231
l thought they'd make us president.

1714
01:59:25,603 --> 01:59:28,003
By the way, Grandpa,
you owe the Chief one.

1715
01:59:28,239 --> 01:59:32,437
He went to bat for you with the lNS and
they're giving asylum to the Hongs.

1716
01:59:32,744 --> 01:59:33,711
All right!

1717
01:59:34,012 --> 01:59:35,411
We're taking a picture.

1718
01:59:35,680 --> 01:59:37,443
We're going to take a picture.

1719
01:59:37,749 --> 01:59:38,807
Get in the picture.

1720
01:59:41,619 --> 01:59:43,883
Squeeze together.
Candy-stripers out.

1721
01:59:44,089 --> 01:59:45,556
Out, out, okay, okay. Out.

1722
01:59:46,224 --> 01:59:48,522
l can't. There's not
enough room. Sorry.

1723
01:59:50,361 --> 01:59:52,022
You got to back up.

1724
01:59:52,931 --> 01:59:54,091
l'm taking big steps!

1725
01:59:54,365 --> 01:59:55,855
Get this guy to take it.

1726
01:59:56,101 --> 01:59:58,763
Doc, do me a favor?
Take a picture of all of us?

1727
02:00:01,940 --> 02:00:04,238
-lt's my best man, after all.
-Closer.

1728
02:00:04,542 --> 02:00:06,100
Get my grandbaby in it too.

1729
02:00:06,444 --> 02:00:07,536
Are you all friends?

1730
02:00:07,779 --> 02:00:10,839
No. We're family!

1731
02:00:11,049 --> 02:00:11,947
Okay, on 3.

1732
02:00:12,117 --> 02:00:14,244
One...two...three
