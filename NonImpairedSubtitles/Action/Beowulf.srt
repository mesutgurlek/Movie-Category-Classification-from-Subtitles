1
00:00:58,576 --> 00:01:00,300
I come for peace

2
00:01:00,609 --> 00:01:02,920
Give me peace my reyna

3
00:01:03,173 --> 00:01:05,687
DENMARK
507 after Christ

4
00:01:10,093 --> 00:01:12,341
My beautiful reyna

5
00:01:19,251 --> 00:01:22,414
The is called Mr. of the death

6
00:01:22,727 --> 00:01:29,808
It will be accepted as the only God

7
00:02:05,378 --> 00:02:06,409
hold

8
00:02:14,991 --> 00:02:17,633
My fans, my beautiful fans

9
00:02:17,888 --> 00:02:21,350
One year ago they made me
their king

10
00:02:21,629 --> 00:02:24,054
We take place tonight

11
00:02:24,326 --> 00:02:25,941
and a new home

12
00:02:26,184 --> 00:02:27,978
Majestic and beautiful

13
00:02:34,673 --> 00:02:39,709
We will share the gold
and the treasure

14
00:02:40,183 --> 00:02:45,134
And this it should be a place
of happiness and fornication

15
00:02:50,278 --> 00:02:54,721
Until the end of the time
I name him... 

16
00:03:11,895 --> 00:03:17,730
A place full with virgins

17
00:03:18,306 --> 00:03:21,331
And this to make honors

18
00:03:24,145 --> 00:03:26,691
Where demons these
bastard's piece

19
00:03:27,616 --> 00:03:29,230
here my king

20
00:03:30,695 --> 00:03:32,013
They come here

21
00:04:01,984 --> 00:04:03,646
The king is not a king

22
00:04:05,909 --> 00:04:08,309
Not it is of the reyna type

23
00:04:12,104 --> 00:04:19,920
The king of many battles

24
00:05:57,779 --> 00:05:59,389
These stealing

25
00:05:59,682 --> 00:06:00,993
these stealing?

26
00:06:04,657 --> 00:06:06,762
As you dare to make me that

27
00:07:54,875 --> 00:07:56,568
A sword!
Give me a sword!

28
00:09:38,268 --> 00:09:39,233
Fight with me!

29
00:09:43,725 --> 00:09:44,698
Fight with me!

30
00:10:28,988 --> 00:10:30,456
It fights with me damned

31
00:11:20,551 --> 00:11:22,649
That that was?

32
00:11:25,501 --> 00:11:27,242
Grendel

33
00:11:41,334 --> 00:11:43,403
That you have made?

34
00:12:01,732 --> 00:12:05,557
Man...  destination

35
00:12:14,456 --> 00:12:17,853
He/she has left many

36
00:13:06,396 --> 00:13:08,367
good boy

37
00:13:24,161 --> 00:13:26,421
Men...  there is another fire

38
00:13:27,398 --> 00:13:29,250
This but there of everything

39
00:13:30,031 --> 00:13:31,279
And he/she burns until the death

40
00:13:32,252 --> 00:13:35,510
Seal all the doors and windows 

41
00:13:35,745 --> 00:13:40,787
For the king's order...  there won't be
any sin

42
00:13:46,152 --> 00:13:47,592
He/she comes to see me

43
00:13:47,807 --> 00:13:51,602
It looked for me until the place
but deep of the island

44
00:13:53,636 --> 00:13:58,583
To the one that discovers it I will give him/her
half of my reyno and 20 men

45
00:13:59,861 --> 00:14:03,533
The king knows that people
it would be sacrificed but

46
00:14:03,730 --> 00:14:07,518
he/she knows, for their pleasure... 

47
00:14:08,243 --> 00:14:11,479
 ...  he/she will live in big

48
00:14:11,915 --> 00:14:15,419
Jesus Christ perhaps can
to cure our afflictions

49
00:14:20,099 --> 00:14:23,049
The God won't make anything
we are us alone

50
00:14:24,424 --> 00:14:25,801
What we need is a hero

51
00:14:43,364 --> 00:14:44,733
Do they come it to come?

52
00:14:45,050 --> 00:14:46,424
As soon as they see it they shoot

53
00:14:46,591 --> 00:14:48,671
I don't see anything but that
the wind in the rain

54
00:14:50,094 --> 00:14:53,625
We are lost

55
00:14:54,498 --> 00:14:57,362
They will see my friends

56
00:14:57,618 --> 00:15:00,169
They can take me until the moon

57
00:15:22,607 --> 00:15:25,066
The storm this worse one my Lord

58
00:15:26,689 --> 00:15:28,893
I was never so sure

59
00:15:29,192 --> 00:15:32,257
These demons didn't leave us

60
00:15:33,021 --> 00:15:35,258
If we win we will eat

61
00:16:53,499 --> 00:16:54,443
Who are?

62
00:16:55,419 --> 00:16:56,685
They are dressed as warriors

63
00:16:56,972 --> 00:16:59,509
He/she speaks or I will cross you

64
00:16:59,784 --> 00:17:03,436
We are navigating... 
I am Beowulf

65
00:17:03,677 --> 00:17:05,204
Son of... 

66
00:17:06,465 --> 00:17:09,716
We come to see your king
for friendship

67
00:17:10,552 --> 00:17:12,965
He/she said that they have a mounstro here

68
00:17:13,696 --> 00:17:15,924
They said that their lands
they are damned

69
00:17:16,260 --> 00:17:16,949
Who says it?

70
00:17:17,285 --> 00:17:21,328
I have seen the king in lands ejanas

71
00:17:21,626 --> 00:17:24,735
-Not hy shame for those demons
-I Am Beowulf

72
00:17:25,773 --> 00:17:27,558
And I came to kill to your mounstro

73
00:17:30,855 --> 00:17:35,654
We have already had silly many heroes
that they come and they die for gold

74
00:17:35,919 --> 00:17:39,094
If we die... 
it will be for glory

75
00:17:39,792 --> 00:17:40,665
not for gold

76
00:17:56,129 --> 00:17:57,872
There are warriors out...  thieves

77
00:17:58,548 --> 00:18:02,174
-One of them calls you Beowulf and he/she said... 
-Bewulf?

78
00:18:04,843 --> 00:18:06,479
Where these?

79
00:18:06,709 --> 00:18:09,055
You are welcome, son

80
00:18:10,504 --> 00:18:11,824
Welcome

81
00:18:12,571 --> 00:18:13,662
How this your partner?

82
00:18:13,918 --> 00:18:14,931
Dead

83
00:18:15,237 --> 00:18:17,976
I thought that it would have been different

84
00:18:18,808 --> 00:18:19,912
It was a very valiant man

85
00:18:20,182 --> 00:18:23,049
I can ask for that
veniste to us?

86
00:18:23,308 --> 00:18:25,056
I came to kill their mounstro

87
00:18:26,909 --> 00:18:29,918
He/she said that he/she was a friend
of you

88
00:18:30,189 --> 00:18:34,154
You should be a man very
brave to come

89
00:18:36,738 --> 00:18:40,578
Many have attempted it

90
00:18:42,162 --> 00:18:43,696
but in the morning

91
00:18:43,935 --> 00:18:47,732
Not there is anything but that
bleed that to clean of the floor

92
00:18:49,355 --> 00:18:52,423
And in the things... 
and in the walls

93
00:18:57,847 --> 00:18:59,163
I come of... 

94
00:18:59,636 --> 00:19:00,507
 ...  anything

95
00:19:00,811 --> 00:19:02,136
Even

96
00:19:03,484 --> 00:19:05,108
But I will kill their mounstro

97
00:19:06,462 --> 00:19:08,713
He will kill our mounstro
do laud scucharon?

98
00:19:09,322 --> 00:19:10,758
Grendel will die

99
00:19:11,541 --> 00:19:13,778
-Grendel?
-The mounstro calls herself Grendel

100
00:19:15,894 --> 00:19:17,689
Then I will kill their Grendel

101
00:19:18,922 --> 00:19:22,698
Me Beowulf, I will cure those
wounded of their peace

102
00:19:23,049 --> 00:19:25,665
I will cross the skulls of
their suffering

103
00:19:26,570 --> 00:19:30,883
And never but there will be bad

104
00:19:31,218 --> 00:19:34,820
A hero! Wise that would need
a hero

105
00:19:36,051 --> 00:19:40,334
You will go to their cave and you will kill
to the mounstro?

106
00:19:40,515 --> 00:19:43,585
I have 14 people with me

107
00:19:44,411 --> 00:19:46,261
We come from the distant sea

108
00:19:47,906 --> 00:19:50,542
And it is a difficult moment
Powerful Hrothgar

109
00:19:50,825 --> 00:19:54,414
Liberate them to all and
give them their food

110
00:19:54,686 --> 00:19:58,892
And the beast and their legendary myths

111
00:19:59,122 --> 00:20:02,955
that myth has been sealed
for their own hand

112
00:20:03,159 --> 00:20:06,782
Many have called
to the devil Grendel

113
00:20:12,432 --> 00:20:16,103
Open the warehouse and let us drink

114
00:20:57,285 --> 00:20:58,883
Not cause but problems

115
00:21:02,094 --> 00:21:04,269
Allow me to assist this

116
00:21:05,242 --> 00:21:08,726
-I have been 5 days waiting this
-5 days?

117
00:21:08,969 --> 00:21:12,320
In the name of my Lord
I am afire

118
00:21:19,933 --> 00:21:21,720
Beowulf, there these

119
00:21:22,439 --> 00:21:25,198
He/she spoke of your friend

120
00:21:25,428 --> 00:21:29,037
You killed them when they were
in their beds 

121
00:21:32,062 --> 00:21:34,189
I have painted something for your father

122
00:21:35,562 --> 00:21:37,039
This sword belonged me

123
00:21:37,915 --> 00:21:41,029
I see that that already the wise ones hey

124
00:21:48,901 --> 00:21:57,429
Great Oh Bewulf comes to survive

125
00:21:58,233 --> 00:22:02,671
We are very grateful,
powerful Beowulf

126
00:22:02,990 --> 00:22:04,185
But... 

127
00:22:04,411 --> 00:22:09,312
 ...  tonight we have one
great question

128
00:22:15,806 --> 00:22:19,235
There was another Beowulf, they told me

129
00:22:19,467 --> 00:22:24,567
That I challenge to the powerful one
in open sea

130
00:22:26,449 --> 00:22:27,627
Were you your?

131
00:22:27,874 --> 00:22:29,977
I swimed in that moment

132
00:22:35,368 --> 00:22:39,208
Because I thought that he/she would have
that to be a different Beowulf

133
00:22:39,489 --> 00:22:41,816
somebody but of the same age

134
00:22:42,111 --> 00:22:46,230
Truth, Beowulf of the one that
I have heard

135
00:22:46,528 --> 00:22:50,643
You swimed against Luckart
and you lost

136
00:22:50,942 --> 00:22:55,011
He/she takes a risk their life and courage

137
00:22:55,464 --> 00:22:58,607
to serve their own one
vanity and pride

138
00:22:58,887 --> 00:23:01,499
Peel for food

139
00:23:02,314 --> 00:23:06,660
And it lost, so... 

140
00:23:06,926 --> 00:23:09,300
 ...  I thought that taenia that
to be somebody but

141
00:23:12,954 --> 00:23:15,204
Swim against Braveckard

142
00:23:16,183 --> 00:23:19,866
But the victory was not yours

143
00:23:20,163 --> 00:23:23,990
A powerful warrior
that nisiquiera can win... 

144
00:23:24,216 --> 00:23:25,512
 ...  a swimmer

145
00:23:27,062 --> 00:23:29,344
I speak alone for myself

146
00:23:31,132 --> 00:23:34,843
Alone to have the doubt

147
00:23:35,109 --> 00:23:42,289
Against Grendel, I doubt that you can
hardly to stay the whole night in their burrow

148
00:23:46,371 --> 00:23:50,042
Difficult encounter to argue
with a drunkard

149
00:23:53,100 --> 00:23:54,212
But it is true

150
00:23:55,048 --> 00:23:56,838
Not I won the career

151
00:23:58,340 --> 00:24:01,550
We swim per days

152
00:24:02,985 --> 00:24:09,436
Certainly my force you finishes

153
00:24:10,719 --> 00:24:13,221
When marine mounstros came

154
00:24:27,776 --> 00:24:30,454
Time and again, attack
to the mounstro

155
00:24:42,228 --> 00:24:44,595
I cut... 

156
00:24:45,379 --> 00:24:48,168
.. that beast with my sword

157
00:24:48,416 --> 00:24:51,193
I spread it for the ocean

158
00:25:12,614 --> 00:25:17,986
Then he/she saw me as 
one of his

159
00:25:21,393 --> 00:25:23,359
And it submerged me

160
00:25:49,748 --> 00:25:54,266
Kill to the mounstro with
my own sword and... 

161
00:25:55,509 --> 00:25:59,085
 ...  among until their heart

162
00:26:01,079 --> 00:26:04,170
And those marine mounstros

163
00:26:05,378 --> 00:26:07,656
And you killed the...  that it was?

164
00:26:08,086 --> 00:26:08,945
20 men?

165
00:26:10,387 --> 00:26:11,477
9

166
00:26:14,625 --> 00:26:18,320
But, if you make me the honor
of telling me your name

167
00:26:21,563 --> 00:26:25,121
I am Unferth son of Wiglaf

168
00:26:26,361 --> 00:26:30,183
Unferth...  son of Wiglof

169
00:26:31,871 --> 00:26:33,129
You who you are?

170
00:26:35,080 --> 00:26:41,722
They say that you killed your siblings
and until to your mother

171
00:26:43,712 --> 00:26:47,174
I have another truth that to tell you

172
00:26:47,985 --> 00:26:51,675
If you were so strong
as you say

173
00:26:52,404 --> 00:26:55,559
Grendel would not dare
to enter with your people

174
00:26:55,827 --> 00:26:57,579
And to put an end to your lineage

175
00:26:57,865 --> 00:27:00,042
Tonight, we will be different

176
00:27:00,255 --> 00:27:03,285
Tonight we will fight

177
00:27:03,525 --> 00:27:05,439
Not comoe ste

178
00:27:11,305 --> 00:27:13,433
As your

179
00:27:22,029 --> 00:27:23,582
It is the spirit of Beowulf

180
00:27:23,848 --> 00:27:25,579
It is the spirit that we need

181
00:27:26,914 --> 00:27:28,751
Then you killed my Grendel

182
00:27:33,341 --> 00:27:34,854
Let us drink

183
00:27:35,161 --> 00:27:36,584
Let us take place

184
00:27:37,536 --> 00:27:38,779
For the murders that you/they will come

185
00:28:11,403 --> 00:28:13,317
They come with me, I want to show you something

186
00:28:39,459 --> 00:28:41,804
It is...  beautiful

187
00:28:43,937 --> 00:28:46,041
It is the best in my treasure

188
00:28:46,882 --> 00:28:51,033
I brought it of my battle
with the dragon

189
00:28:51,957 --> 00:28:53,473
Me cost almost the life

190
00:28:54,733 --> 00:28:58,343
It is here where conquered
the throat

191
00:29:00,354 --> 00:29:03,504
With a sword

192
00:29:07,130 --> 00:29:08,858
It is the only way
of killing a dragon

193
00:29:10,986 --> 00:29:15,801
I wonder how many men they have
died by the love to the beauty

194
00:29:17,175 --> 00:29:18,805
Can you make it?

195
00:29:19,103 --> 00:29:21,912
If you destroy my Grendel

196
00:29:23,323 --> 00:29:25,422
She will be forever yours

197
00:29:25,674 --> 00:29:27,424
And forever

198
00:29:30,219 --> 00:29:33,003
You make me a great honor

199
00:29:34,722 --> 00:29:36,900
Single wait the honor

200
00:30:00,018 --> 00:30:02,337
It is alone a wolf,
he/she doesn't know neither of where he/she comes

201
00:30:02,608 --> 00:30:05,227
No, we will be here
I promise it

202
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:09,489
We go, it will be a transport
to the paradise

203
00:30:09,814 --> 00:30:14,115
Where nobody but it rots to satisfy you

204
00:30:14,565 --> 00:30:16,450
-I sit down it
-We go

205
00:30:16,678 --> 00:30:18,683
-Certainly I don't want
-for that not?

206
00:30:18,929 --> 00:30:22,929
Not we can sleep, the mounstro
it arrived in any moment

207
00:30:24,014 --> 00:30:26,083
That you find something quick?

208
00:30:31,498 --> 00:30:33,583
Your partner

209
00:30:34,543 --> 00:30:36,027
This old one

210
00:30:36,262 --> 00:30:37,499
He/she needs to sleep

211
00:30:38,552 --> 00:30:42,377
They come my beautiful one

212
00:30:44,916 --> 00:30:45,919
In a moment

213
00:30:47,059 --> 00:30:50,951
They come, we have to leave

214
00:30:51,197 --> 00:30:52,843
Don't play me

215
00:30:54,668 --> 00:30:56,804
It is the spirit, lover

216
00:30:57,602 --> 00:30:58,611
My Lord

217
00:31:03,860 --> 00:31:10,987
Maybe their majesty wanted
to stay a moment but

218
00:31:11,265 --> 00:31:13,070
before retiring

219
00:31:18,791 --> 00:31:20,968
It is it less than I can make

220
00:31:28,207 --> 00:31:30,877
Beowulf, not you, 
I will see you in the morning

221
00:31:31,138 --> 00:31:37,371
And aegurate that your 
I equip it assures the doors

222
00:31:38,869 --> 00:31:40,069
good night

223
00:31:46,329 --> 00:31:50,917
I have seen the mounstro, I am sure
that their imagination should be flying

224
00:33:03,024 --> 00:33:05,515
That fué...  beautiful

225
00:33:19,774 --> 00:33:23,847
-It will be a long night, their majesty
-clear

226
00:33:24,180 --> 00:33:25,709
Grendel

227
00:33:32,837 --> 00:33:34,907
The demon is the shame
of my husband

228
00:33:35,130 --> 00:33:37,029
Not it is a shame...  it is
a madición

229
00:33:38,090 --> 00:33:40,197
No...  shame

230
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:43,258
My husband knows it

231
00:33:43,970 --> 00:33:46,209
Without children

232
00:33:46,609 --> 00:33:48,115
And you don't have anything but 
that to speak

233
00:33:48,363 --> 00:33:51,333
There he/she comes, I saw it

234
00:34:03,627 --> 00:34:05,313
That they make?

235
00:34:07,018 --> 00:34:09,514
It is said that without swords neither armor

236
00:34:09,773 --> 00:34:12,914
and I have a weapon that
it is the but important

237
00:34:13,223 --> 00:34:18,219
We will fight like equal

238
00:34:42,742 --> 00:34:44,669
Closed the ten

239
00:35:02,410 --> 00:35:03,640
If

240
00:35:19,849 --> 00:35:21,355
we will be prepared

241
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:24,050
Resolved

242
00:35:24,414 --> 00:35:26,338
Too many here

243
00:35:26,723 --> 00:35:29,281
This is the moment

244
00:35:32,376 --> 00:35:35,076
The warriors should be clever

245
00:35:36,227 --> 00:35:37,374
Good night Wiglaf

246
00:35:42,844 --> 00:35:46,982
-That we should make while?
-Sing...  high

247
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:53,673
They already listened to it

248
00:36:49,536 --> 00:36:52,604
It should be my candy... 

249
00:36:53,700 --> 00:36:55,393
My Lord

250
00:36:58,368 --> 00:37:01,054
Patience, my lord

251
00:41:45,314 --> 00:41:46,918
I am the thief of the darkness

252
00:41:47,251 --> 00:41:48,376
The tiranod and the night

253
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:52,456
The force, the power

254
00:41:53,580 --> 00:41:54,790
 I am Beowulf

255
00:42:29,347 --> 00:42:30,863
The beast has left 

256
00:42:31,699 --> 00:42:34,369
Beowulf has won

257
00:42:46,177 --> 00:42:48,914
My Lord, Beowulf has killed
to the demon

258
00:42:50,777 --> 00:42:52,855
He/she hears my prayers

259
00:42:54,082 --> 00:42:57,479
That he/she expands the word

260
00:43:00,894 --> 00:43:03,273
Today will be a day of glory

261
00:43:04,980 --> 00:43:06,231
The nightmare has finished

262
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:11,411
They come to the bed

263
00:43:14,612 --> 00:43:16,864
I am the king and I need a son

264
00:43:17,111 --> 00:43:18,555
They come to fulfill your duty

265
00:43:19,306 --> 00:43:22,583
As he/she could live with you
knowing that you live for her

266
00:43:31,156 --> 00:43:32,546
God willing he/she had never told it to you

267
00:43:57,657 --> 00:43:59,857
My poor son

268
00:44:28,752 --> 00:44:30,989
They paid it

269
00:44:42,751 --> 00:44:44,676
Who was?

270
00:44:59,832 --> 00:45:01,290
Beowulf

271
00:45:14,992 --> 00:45:16,925
Beowulf

272
00:45:24,873 --> 00:45:27,069
They were warring valiant

273
00:45:30,131 --> 00:45:34,204
-Until they found their death
-They were conquered by a ferocious creature

274
00:45:34,477 --> 00:45:36,008
Of the prisons of the hell

275
00:45:36,928 --> 00:45:39,736
They will always have their glory

276
00:45:45,886 --> 00:45:47,060
They come

277
00:45:47,376 --> 00:45:52,317
Abrazemos their memory
I want that your you make it first

278
00:45:53,092 --> 00:45:54,825
Not I have humor for that

279
00:45:56,238 --> 00:45:59,405
I have finished here as warrior

280
00:46:01,496 --> 00:46:03,650
We will even live tomorrow

281
00:46:03,875 --> 00:46:05,411
Or not?

282
00:46:13,562 --> 00:46:18,243
This has been an entire sadness

283
00:46:19,544 --> 00:46:24,227
In front of us it has been patient
hugging the death

284
00:46:24,598 --> 00:46:25,386
But today... 

285
00:46:27,171 --> 00:46:28,691
The mounstro reyno
it has finished

286
00:46:28,950 --> 00:46:31,925
I kill to the mounstro with
their own hands

287
00:46:33,172 --> 00:46:37,075
-I wonder like it will be to be among those hands
-And their legs also

288
00:46:40,370 --> 00:46:43,336
I am sure that you can discover it

289
00:46:43,580 --> 00:46:46,194
Me? Not I am me, my reyna

290
00:46:52,184 --> 00:46:55,154
zQuiero that you make the honors

291
00:47:09,543 --> 00:47:10,497
For you my Lord

292
00:47:30,116 --> 00:47:32,597
He/she would want them to have me
seen last night

293
00:47:32,960 --> 00:47:34,070
when I conquered to the mounstro

294
00:47:34,824 --> 00:47:36,770
He/she was sleeping when it arrived

295
00:47:48,804 --> 00:47:51,702
And I said...  I am Beowulf!

296
00:49:34,210 --> 00:49:35,528
Valiant thief

297
00:49:38,535 --> 00:49:39,749
My reyna

298
00:49:50,864 --> 00:49:52,684
I love you

299
00:49:52,964 --> 00:49:55,251
I want you to be my king

300
00:49:56,006 --> 00:49:59,453
Alone your, my hero

301
00:50:02,795 --> 00:50:04,255
Not I understand

302
00:50:05,889 --> 00:50:07,224
Where this your husband

303
00:50:08,328 --> 00:50:09,320
dead

304
00:50:11,186 --> 00:50:12,568
dead?

305
00:50:14,320 --> 00:50:15,686
This is a dream

306
00:50:17,037 --> 00:50:19,347
This is alone a dream

307
00:50:20,507 --> 00:50:23,630
am I a dream?

308
00:50:25,100 --> 00:50:26,619
Give me a boy

309
00:50:27,369 --> 00:50:29,615
Take as your... 

310
00:51:08,414 --> 00:51:09,956
Your you brought them the death

311
00:51:11,408 --> 00:51:13,636
It is your blame

312
00:51:14,913 --> 00:51:17,794
-Not it was Grendel
-Was grendel not?

313
00:51:18,006 --> 00:51:19,167
Then who?

314
00:51:19,409 --> 00:51:20,633
Their mother

315
00:51:22,510 --> 00:51:24,012
Grendel that killed

316
00:51:24,948 --> 00:51:29,675
And their mother, they have been in
the Earth a long time ago

317
00:51:31,113 --> 00:51:33,052
How many mounstros should I kill?

318
00:51:35,172 --> 00:51:36,773
The mother of Grendel, the father?

319
00:51:37,020 --> 00:51:38,188
The uncle of Grendel

320
00:51:38,371 --> 00:51:41,411
Maybe this the whole family tree
of demons?

321
00:51:42,224 --> 00:51:48,000
Until half night, the demon
he/she sleeps in that cave

322
00:51:48,471 --> 00:51:51,946
And the mother's couple... 

323
00:51:52,165 --> 00:51:53,998
 ...  where the father is
of Grendel?

324
00:51:57,856 --> 00:52:00,298
The Father of Grendel is not
but that a man

325
00:52:05,270 --> 00:52:06,517
Beowulf

326
00:52:07,608 --> 00:52:09,519
I made a mistake when doubting
of you before

327
00:52:09,712 --> 00:52:11,993
and I won't make it another time

328
00:52:12,205 --> 00:52:14,142
The value is yours

329
00:52:14,433 --> 00:52:16,304
I request you you forgive me

330
00:52:32,830 --> 00:52:36,428
He/she takes my sword, it belonged
to my father's father

331
00:52:37,376 --> 00:52:38,594
He/she calls himself Grantin

332
00:52:39,509 --> 00:52:43,041
That sword is not anything
against the magic of the demons

333
00:52:44,503 --> 00:52:46,833
Lament to have doubted

334
00:52:51,927 --> 00:52:56,330
Lament to have mentioned
to your siblings

335
00:52:57,271 --> 00:52:59,439
They were dirty words

336
00:53:02,624 --> 00:53:03,804
Unforth... 

337
00:53:04,845 --> 00:53:06,409
 ...  he/she can that he/she doesn't return

338
00:53:07,797 --> 00:53:10,938
Your ancestral sword you anger with me

339
00:53:11,929 --> 00:53:13,536
Whenever this with you

340
00:53:14,271 --> 00:53:15,532
It will never be lost

341
00:53:25,119 --> 00:53:28,445
And your...  powerful Wiglaf

342
00:53:30,705 --> 00:53:32,491
Do you even continue with me?

343
00:53:35,367 --> 00:53:36,380
Until the end

344
00:54:04,198 --> 00:54:05,341
he/she looks

345
00:54:11,178 --> 00:54:13,453
It is the demon's earth

346
00:54:14,153 --> 00:54:16,519
-don't come closer too there
-him you

347
00:54:18,726 --> 00:54:22,196
while this with you...  well

348
00:54:23,596 --> 00:54:25,180
allow me

349
00:56:32,637 --> 00:56:35,669
I see that you brought me a treasure

350
00:56:40,267 --> 00:56:42,022
Show you

351
00:57:34,269 --> 00:57:36,751
Are you the call Beowulf?

352
00:57:57,093 --> 00:58:01,449
Beowulf...  barbarian

353
00:58:14,340 --> 00:58:17,026
You are a very strong man

354
00:58:18,435 --> 00:58:20,461
With the force of a king

355
00:58:22,556 --> 00:58:25,336
The king in the one that one day
you will become

356
00:58:28,443 --> 00:58:29,445
Your that you know about my?

357
00:58:31,287 --> 00:58:32,103
Demon

358
00:58:32,380 --> 00:58:36,448
Him you, this under
of your gamour

359
00:58:36,770 --> 00:58:39,995
You are so mounstro, as my son

360
00:58:40,276 --> 00:58:41,543
Grendel

361
00:58:43,542 --> 00:58:45,331
My glamour!

362
00:58:46,579 --> 00:58:48,725
My nephew Grendel

363
00:58:49,024 --> 00:58:51,225
He/she would transform into king

364
00:58:53,016 --> 00:58:55,061
A man like your

365
00:58:55,357 --> 00:58:59,057
He/she could have the adult 
treasure never seen

366
00:59:00,186 --> 00:59:02,418
Your history will always live

367
00:59:02,694 --> 00:59:06,397
With all those that 
they met you I live

368
00:59:07,445 --> 00:59:09,348
Be powder

369
00:59:19,378 --> 00:59:21,831
A lot of time has passed

370
00:59:22,698 --> 00:59:24,966
Since they came to see me

371
00:59:26,371 --> 00:59:28,386
I need my sword paa to kill you

372
00:59:31,208 --> 00:59:34,460
Undoubtedly you know me

373
00:59:36,994 --> 00:59:39,124
You removed me a son

374
00:59:41,641 --> 00:59:44,506
Give me a son

375
00:59:46,654 --> 00:59:48,285
Stay with me

376
00:59:49,998 --> 00:59:51,237
Love me

377
00:59:53,861 --> 00:59:55,242
Love me

378
00:59:55,614 --> 01:00:01,870
And I will show you something
but there of the imagination

379
01:00:03,388 --> 01:00:08,361
I will make you the but big king

380
01:00:09,148 --> 01:00:10,485
That he/she has never lived

381
01:00:18,737 --> 01:00:22,862
Provided me abrazes
with your art

382
01:00:23,143 --> 01:00:26,551
With this golden Horn

383
01:00:26,795 --> 01:00:29,333
Be immaculate

384
01:00:30,124 --> 01:00:31,902
You will always be a king

385
01:00:35,328 --> 01:00:36,717
For always strong

386
01:00:38,456 --> 01:00:39,699
Magestuoso

387
01:00:40,681 --> 01:00:42,344
And all powerful one

388
01:00:44,517 --> 01:00:47,589
I promise it to you

389
01:00:52,054 --> 01:00:57,142
I swear him to you

390
01:01:16,989 --> 01:01:17,978
My lord

391
01:01:19,971 --> 01:01:21,207
This dead one

392
01:01:22,058 --> 01:01:25,645
When it finishes with the
mother mounstro of Grendel

393
01:01:26,879 --> 01:01:28,771
I said that he/she would make it

394
01:01:30,470 --> 01:01:31,633
The curse has been lit

395
01:01:32,789 --> 01:01:35,177
The curse has been lit

396
01:01:35,999 --> 01:01:38,360
Beowulf

397
01:01:38,635 --> 01:01:40,416
The curse has been lit

398
01:01:42,449 --> 01:01:43,661
remove it of my view

399
01:01:44,657 --> 01:01:46,853
Bury him in the sea

400
01:01:47,154 --> 01:01:48,256
quick

401
01:01:51,169 --> 01:01:52,880
Insert my weapon... 

402
01:01:53,155 --> 01:01:54,844
In the mother's chest
of Grendel

403
01:01:55,659 --> 01:01:58,951
And with my sword him
liberate of the curse

404
01:01:59,267 --> 01:02:04,908
The creature requested me for her life
and I crossed my sword for their chest

405
01:02:05,260 --> 01:02:09,731
And it perished

406
01:02:13,383 --> 01:02:16,737
Now our people will be
grateful with you

407
01:02:23,287 --> 01:02:24,826
He/she came, my Lord

408
01:02:28,120 --> 01:02:33,626
-The Golden Horn...  do you have it?
-No

409
01:02:35,582 --> 01:02:40,011
Wise that taenia that to leave it

410
01:02:40,318 --> 01:02:42,615
It was this way like it happened

411
01:02:43,026 --> 01:02:45,085
The same as the majestic sword

412
01:02:47,059 --> 01:02:49,809
They have left

413
01:02:50,542 --> 01:02:51,452
Forever

414
01:02:52,302 --> 01:02:54,571
Then another hero will come

415
01:02:54,793 --> 01:02:56,693
my love

416
01:02:57,771 --> 01:03:00,813
first, we should speak
the hero and me

417
01:03:02,638 --> 01:03:03,957
Beowulf

418
01:03:11,839 --> 01:03:14,413
You brought the head of Grendel... 

419
01:03:15,739 --> 01:03:16,952
 ...  and the mother's head?

420
01:03:18,906 --> 01:03:21,263
With her nobody survived

421
01:03:22,010 --> 01:03:25,202
Not it is enough with returning
with the head of a mountro?

422
01:03:26,802 --> 01:03:27,975
Did you kill her?

423
01:03:29,244 --> 01:03:31,814
Does he/she want to listen my history?

424
01:03:32,048 --> 01:03:33,552
That mounstro suffered

425
01:03:35,686 --> 01:03:39,414
She is not this way, Beouwlf
both we know it

426
01:03:40,578 --> 01:03:43,595
But respond me...  the matste?

427
01:03:50,810 --> 01:03:53,409
Would he/she have been able to escape?

428
01:03:54,138 --> 01:03:55,071
If he/she had not made it?

429
01:04:02,989 --> 01:04:05,184
Grendel is dead
it is what I care

430
01:04:06,692 --> 01:04:08,125
It didn't bother me but

431
01:04:09,526 --> 01:04:14,523
The mother...  it is not my curse

432
01:04:16,673 --> 01:04:17,959
no longer

433
01:04:19,792 --> 01:04:20,898
no longer

434
01:04:22,869 --> 01:04:24,786
Listen to me

435
01:04:25,045 --> 01:04:26,517
listen to me

436
01:04:30,202 --> 01:04:34,274
Because that my Lord Beoulf
it is a magestuoso hero

437
01:04:34,540 --> 01:04:38,746
Because the one killed the demon Grendel

438
01:04:39,013 --> 01:04:41,669
And I leave their mother in the hell

439
01:04:44,856 --> 01:04:46,277
Because I don't have... 

440
01:04:47,207 --> 01:04:50,943
 ...  I don't have descending

441
01:04:53,598 --> 01:04:56,193
I declare that all my power

442
01:04:56,483 --> 01:04:57,834
all that I possess

443
01:04:58,800 --> 01:05:00,147
my reyno

444
01:05:00,392 --> 01:05:01,902
my home

445
01:05:02,182 --> 01:05:04,094
Without sadness neither shame

446
01:05:04,918 --> 01:05:07,994
 Even my adorable reyna

447
01:05:10,535 --> 01:05:12,412
My Wealthow

448
01:05:15,414 --> 01:05:16,505
Everything

449
01:05:17,742 --> 01:05:18,885
Everything

450
01:05:22,830 --> 01:05:26,316
I leave it to this our hero

451
01:05:26,641 --> 01:05:28,336
-But my Lord
-I have spoken

452
01:05:31,834 --> 01:05:33,108
I have spoken

453
01:05:37,472 --> 01:05:43,614
I declare that Beoulf, be a king!

454
01:06:27,558 --> 01:06:29,462
He/she should have fallen

455
01:06:59,805 --> 01:07:04,217
It releases Life to the king Beowulf

456
01:07:05,392 --> 01:07:06,863
Oh grandiose king Beouwlf

457
01:07:10,909 --> 01:07:12,451
Beowulf

458
01:07:49,300 --> 01:07:50,615
Archers!

459
01:08:21,496 --> 01:08:23,300
Not it is a battle of glory

460
01:08:24,427 --> 01:08:25,685
It is an insult

461
01:08:28,462 --> 01:08:30,777
The destination doesn't favor 
to the heroes, my Lord

462
01:08:31,872 --> 01:08:35,559
-Neither we can get rid
-It should have something but

463
01:08:35,859 --> 01:08:37,307
as you can accuse yourself

464
01:08:37,520 --> 01:08:43,394
Your you don't have mounstros

465
01:08:43,783 --> 01:08:45,940
He/she can that now we don't have mounstros

466
01:08:48,232 --> 01:08:51,023
The time of the heroes
this dead

467
01:08:52,050 --> 01:08:56,708
The humanity is not even anything but that... 

468
01:08:57,567 --> 01:08:59,004
 ...  we have been martyrs

469
01:08:59,290 --> 01:09:02,030
The fear, the verguenza

470
01:09:11,747 --> 01:09:14,201
You believe that you are better than the other ones

471
01:09:15,105 --> 01:09:18,240
Get up quick

472
01:09:21,076 --> 01:09:22,412
Kill me yourself

473
01:09:24,207 --> 01:09:26,077
The king won't enter in problems

474
01:09:26,480 --> 01:09:30,965
-Already you angers, quick
-High

475
01:09:41,528 --> 01:09:45,860
My Lord, the king doesn't should
to be in direct battle

476
01:09:47,640 --> 01:09:49,012
That he/she gets up

477
01:09:53,892 --> 01:09:56,510
As you call yourself and for that
you call me Beowulf

478
01:09:58,280 --> 01:10:00,968
You believe that it would owe marte

479
01:10:01,433 --> 01:10:03,662
That there is freedom
and freedom with your name

480
01:10:08,432 --> 01:10:10,955
My king

481
01:10:11,846 --> 01:10:13,702
and my name will always be ecordadopor

482
01:10:14,861 --> 01:10:16,909
alone if you kill me

483
01:10:32,828 --> 01:10:37,185
The gods cannot die
for the sword

484
01:10:37,399 --> 01:10:43,047
the God don't rot to be cursed

485
01:10:46,279 --> 01:10:48,988
Put your axe here

486
01:10:55,098 --> 01:11:02,696
Nobody kills me...  Kill me!

487
01:11:20,429 --> 01:11:23,089
don't rot to kill me my friend

488
01:11:25,170 --> 01:11:28,913
I died many years ago
when it was young

489
01:11:35,915 --> 01:11:40,327
Envuenlo to house, has
a history that to count

490
01:12:29,662 --> 01:12:31,970
you know, when I was young

491
01:12:32,850 --> 01:12:36,376
he/she thought that the being king
it was not but that to fight

492
01:12:41,008 --> 01:12:42,249
to savor the skin of the women
in the night

493
01:12:46,536 --> 01:12:48,753
anything is as good as
it should be

494
01:12:50,336 --> 01:12:53,978
does nisiquiera swim a beautiful woman?

495
01:13:11,948 --> 01:13:14,233
-He/she will come tomorrow
-Your angers?

496
01:13:17,581 --> 01:13:20,450
that if it gave up the darkness
for an Earth

497
01:13:37,994 --> 01:13:42,820
Originalmentre you them erporta
to the sea

498
01:13:52,482 --> 01:13:53,873
my husband

499
01:15:05,917 --> 01:15:07,841
celebreraremos the glory of their reyno
tonight

500
01:15:08,765 --> 01:15:10,766
I have something for the tree

501
01:15:11,700 --> 01:15:15,513
-that it is?
-I said, I bring something for the king

502
01:15:22,979 --> 01:15:26,460
I bring something that the king
necesuta verar

503
01:16:47,951 --> 01:16:51,025
my Lord, this he/she is the slave
that he/she found it

504
01:17:14,117 --> 01:17:15,272
In the forest

505
01:17:18,986 --> 01:17:20,381
I swear him

506
01:18:03,118 --> 01:18:04,665
you look at yourself

507
01:18:04,939 --> 01:18:07,022
you are not anything

508
01:18:10,003 --> 01:18:13,466
come closer and show you

509
01:18:30,457 --> 01:18:34,359
to who you want that it kills first?

510
01:18:35,985 --> 01:18:38,753
to your beautiful wife.

511
01:18:44,798 --> 01:18:46,211
that you are?

512
01:19:41,762 --> 01:19:44,290
he/she has many but

513
01:19:45,071 --> 01:19:46,815
they come but followed

514
01:19:48,456 --> 01:19:51,312
the king has maybe lost
the conscience?

515
01:20:03,706 --> 01:20:05,738
Or if?

516
01:20:12,331 --> 01:20:14,281
I believe that he/she even has
it thrills in their body

517
01:20:26,087 --> 01:20:28,163
that it passed us?

518
01:20:34,635 --> 01:20:35,648
to my secrets

519
01:20:42,891 --> 01:20:44,189
Or God, help us

520
01:21:22,383 --> 01:21:26,585
-do tell me that this made?
-he/she made it a dragon

521
01:21:28,993 --> 01:21:32,347
-I saw it their majesty, vomiting guego
-damned it is

522
01:21:45,307 --> 01:21:50,317
your you dressed the demon

523
01:21:51,182 --> 01:21:53,586
the golden horn has returned to you

524
01:21:53,906 --> 01:21:56,272
The agreement has finished

525
01:21:57,193 --> 01:21:59,715
Who that said?

526
01:22:05,140 --> 01:22:09,077
I saw it while my family
it was burnt alive!

527
01:22:17,457 --> 01:22:19,910
the father's sins

528
01:22:34,703 --> 01:22:36,191
do you want him to go with you?

529
01:22:39,143 --> 01:22:40,728
well

530
01:23:26,581 --> 01:23:27,986
Beowulf

531
01:23:29,064 --> 01:23:31,382
a lot of time has passed

532
01:23:41,647 --> 01:23:43,196
He/she leaves alone my earth

533
01:23:46,900 --> 01:23:49,046
It is too much afternoon, my Lord

534
01:35:13,414 --> 01:35:15,990
I told you that it had happened a lot
time without heroes

535
01:35:20,273 --> 01:35:21,692
Not this time, friend

536
01:35:23,127 --> 01:35:24,509
Your you are Beowulf

537
01:35:25,418 --> 01:35:27,514
this it is not the end of your life

538
01:35:29,483 --> 01:35:31,740
do you listen?

539
01:35:35,341 --> 01:35:36,462
Not I listen anything

540
01:35:38,157 --> 01:35:40,628
The mother of Grendel... 
the mother's son

541
01:35:42,918 --> 01:35:44,393
You killed their mother

542
01:35:44,686 --> 01:35:46,183
When young eras

543
01:35:50,825 --> 01:35:52,140
It is too much afternoon for lies

544
01:35:52,422 --> 01:35:58,537
Wiglaf...  very late

545
01:37:04,229 --> 01:37:08,945
It was...  the but brave of all

546
01:37:13,709 --> 01:37:14,973
He/she was a prince

547
01:37:17,770 --> 01:37:19,582
Their glories

548
01:37:22,889 --> 01:37:24,986
Their name...  he/she will live forever

549
01:37:37,272 --> 01:37:39,709
Their song will be sung forever
