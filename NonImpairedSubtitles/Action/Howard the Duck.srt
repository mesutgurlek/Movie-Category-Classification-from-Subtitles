1
00:01:44,646 --> 00:01:48,047
Hi, honey, this is your mother.
Listen, I know you're very busy...

2
00:01:48,183 --> 00:01:51,084
with the new job but
please try and call us.

3
00:01:51,253 --> 00:01:53,551
Did you get the birthday
sweater we sent?

4
00:01:53,689 --> 00:01:56,157
We'll be home all weekend.
Bye.

5
00:01:57,826 --> 00:02:00,852
Howard, Jim here. We still set
for racquet ball on Saturday.

6
00:02:00,996 --> 00:02:02,827
Give me a shout,
Buddy, bye-bye.

7
00:02:03,665 --> 00:02:08,534
Hi, it's Wendy. I had this really
intense dream last night, Howie.

8
00:02:08,704 --> 00:02:11,605
I was running my fingers through
your feathers, and all...

9
00:02:11,740 --> 00:02:15,733
of a sudden well, you better come
over tonight and I'll show you...

10
00:02:15,878 --> 00:02:19,507
what really happened next.
Ciao for now, Howie.

11
00:02:24,186 --> 00:02:30,352
Hey, Ricky's back with you again for
lots more Dance Frenzy excitement.

12
00:02:30,492 --> 00:02:34,053
Here's couple number three
our lovely Latin dance team...

13
00:02:34,229 --> 00:02:38,063
from Wedford Falls, Charles is a
Machinist First Class in the Navy...

14
00:02:38,233 --> 00:02:42,067
and his darling wife,
Madge, is a blackjack dealer.

15
00:02:47,342 --> 00:02:50,140
Just a super jock dance.
Charles and Madge.

16
00:02:50,279 --> 00:02:52,406
Come on,
let's hear for them, folks.

17
00:02:52,548 --> 00:02:54,516
What's the matter, George?

18
00:02:55,183 --> 00:02:58,550
Jock itch again?
I've got just the thing.

19
00:02:58,687 --> 00:03:02,384
Here. Why not take
a shot of New Shorts Blaster?

20
00:03:02,524 --> 00:03:05,220
It's guaranteed to wipe out
feather fungus in even...

21
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:07,988
- the most active crotches.
- Shorts Blaster.

22
00:03:08,130 --> 00:03:13,568
In addiction, you've won a new car.
But that's not all.

23
00:03:14,436 --> 00:03:17,098
Fred, I love you so much.

24
00:03:17,272 --> 00:03:20,173
- It hurts like hell.
- He's dead.

25
00:03:21,109 --> 00:03:23,839
$79,95?
Forget it!

26
00:03:23,979 --> 00:03:27,346
$49,99?
No way.

27
00:03:27,482 --> 00:03:32,317
I'm crazy and
my prices are insane!

28
00:03:41,063 --> 00:03:44,294
Who did they
interview this month?

29
00:03:49,638 --> 00:03:53,096
My little airbrush beauty.

30
00:03:56,511 --> 00:03:58,172
What?

31
00:04:01,316 --> 00:04:02,977
No, it's a quake!

32
00:04:05,053 --> 00:04:07,385
I can't get up!

33
00:04:08,390 --> 00:04:10,187
What's going on here?

34
00:04:13,295 --> 00:04:16,355
Casey, did you hear something?

35
00:04:17,733 --> 00:04:23,535
I'm such a lucky girl
I'm in love

36
00:05:02,944 --> 00:05:04,741
The Cosmos.

37
00:05:05,347 --> 00:05:11,047
Countless worlds upon worlds.
Worlds without end.

38
00:05:11,420 --> 00:05:15,914
In these galaxies
every possible reality exits.

39
00:05:16,124 --> 00:05:21,994
And what is reality on any one
world is mere fantasy on all others.

40
00:05:22,297 --> 00:05:26,734
Here, all is real
and all is illusion.

41
00:05:27,502 --> 00:05:33,236
What is, what was and what
will be start here with the words.

42
00:05:33,442 --> 00:05:36,343
In the beginning
there was...

43
00:05:36,778 --> 00:05:39,872
"Howard the Duck".

44
00:06:11,046 --> 00:06:13,378
Boy!

45
00:06:35,737 --> 00:06:38,365
I'm a dead duck.

46
00:06:38,573 --> 00:06:40,404
Hey, come on.

47
00:06:40,776 --> 00:06:42,175
No!

48
00:06:45,847 --> 00:06:51,080
Bender, go on in, Frankenweed.
We finally found you a date.

49
00:06:54,055 --> 00:06:55,784
What is this?

50
00:06:58,126 --> 00:07:00,822
That costume doesn't fool me.
No kids allowed.

51
00:07:00,962 --> 00:07:03,123
- Come on, Kid.
- Wait a minute, that's my date.

52
00:07:03,298 --> 00:07:04,788
I said out of the way!

53
00:07:13,275 --> 00:07:15,140
No, wait!

54
00:07:15,811 --> 00:07:17,108
You little creep!

55
00:07:17,245 --> 00:07:20,180
Get away from my cart,
you filthy degenerated.

56
00:07:45,507 --> 00:07:47,702
- Christ, it touched me!
- What the hell is it?

57
00:07:48,510 --> 00:07:50,375
I wasn't trying anything!
Honest!

58
00:07:50,512 --> 00:07:52,412
Step on him!

59
00:08:10,832 --> 00:08:13,130
Up, up and away!

60
00:08:19,674 --> 00:08:21,835
Are you ready
for an incredible story?

61
00:08:21,977 --> 00:08:25,970
- Waste it, man, waste it!
- No!

62
00:08:48,036 --> 00:08:51,403
Talk about a rotten day?

63
00:09:11,259 --> 00:09:13,159
- Just saw your show.
- Great, thanks.

64
00:09:13,295 --> 00:09:15,388
- Beverly, we love your music.
- Goodbye now.

65
00:09:15,530 --> 00:09:17,555
Could I have your
autograph on my shirt?

66
00:09:17,732 --> 00:09:19,666
Me too.
On my shorts?

67
00:09:19,834 --> 00:09:21,927
Real charming.
Just go away, okay?

68
00:09:22,203 --> 00:09:24,228
We're talking to you,
big Rock Star!

69
00:09:24,406 --> 00:09:27,170
- Don't do anything!
- Don't go snot nose on us.

70
00:09:27,342 --> 00:09:30,140
- We're your biggest fans.
- Let me go!

71
00:09:35,350 --> 00:09:38,376
Help somebody, help!
Help!

72
00:09:39,754 --> 00:09:41,722
Come here, snot nose!

73
00:09:43,091 --> 00:09:47,027
That's it.
No more Mister Nice Duck!

74
00:09:51,967 --> 00:09:54,458
Let the female creature go.

75
00:09:55,770 --> 00:10:00,798
Every duck's got his limit, and you
scum have pushed me over the line.

76
00:10:01,476 --> 00:10:04,411
Jimmy,
do you like see what I see?

77
00:10:04,546 --> 00:10:07,640
- A talking duck?
- Yeah. That's it.

78
00:10:07,816 --> 00:10:12,116
I've been doing too much toot.
Fly away!

79
00:10:12,253 --> 00:10:15,416
No one laughs at
a master of Quack-Foo!

80
00:10:19,694 --> 00:10:21,525
Jimmy, you okay?

81
00:10:30,405 --> 00:10:32,202
Get off me!

82
00:10:38,646 --> 00:10:40,477
You, creep, get out of here!

83
00:10:45,954 --> 00:10:47,854
You're breaking my fingers!

84
00:10:48,023 --> 00:10:53,188
Now, you and baby face
are gonna beat it, right, Mr. Zitz?

85
00:10:53,328 --> 00:10:56,456
Before I get really mad!

86
00:10:57,465 --> 00:11:00,525
Come on!
Let's get out of here!

87
00:11:02,437 --> 00:11:07,136
This is obviously no place for
an intelligent, sensitive duck.

88
00:11:08,176 --> 00:11:11,737
This is unreal.
I mean, it can't be.

89
00:11:11,980 --> 00:11:17,782
- Thanks.
- You're not really a duck?

90
00:11:17,986 --> 00:11:22,980
You know, this is beginning to
seriously undermine my self-esteem.

91
00:11:23,191 --> 00:11:28,185
I'm sorry, I guess I should thank
you for chasing those guys off.

92
00:11:28,396 --> 00:11:31,422
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, sure. Terrific.

93
00:11:31,599 --> 00:11:36,298
I just have one giant question.
Where am I?

94
00:11:37,472 --> 00:11:39,201
The lights up there
are Ninth Street and...

95
00:11:39,340 --> 00:11:40,898
the bus stops
at the corner of Powell.

96
00:11:41,076 --> 00:11:44,512
No, no, no, no.
I'm asking, what is this place?

97
00:11:45,013 --> 00:11:47,914
- Cleveland?
- Cleveland?

98
00:11:48,183 --> 00:11:51,550
That's a perfect weird name
for this planet.

99
00:11:51,686 --> 00:11:53,950
Planet?
No, no, that's a city.

100
00:11:54,122 --> 00:11:57,421
The planet's
You don't know the planet?

101
00:11:59,994 --> 00:12:03,122
The planet's called Earth,
I think.

102
00:12:03,264 --> 00:12:05,892
And I'm obviously in some
sort of terrible nightmare.

103
00:12:06,067 --> 00:12:08,900
Yeah?
Your nightmare or mine?

104
00:12:09,070 --> 00:12:10,867
Good point.

105
00:12:11,806 --> 00:12:16,072
So, I guess
I better be going.

106
00:12:19,214 --> 00:12:21,011
Thanks again.

107
00:12:23,218 --> 00:12:24,981
Bye.

108
00:12:27,956 --> 00:12:29,981
Bye.

109
00:13:00,155 --> 00:13:03,591
Listen?
You got someplace to go?

110
00:13:03,758 --> 00:13:09,560
If I had someplace to go,
I certainly wouldn't be in Cleveland.

111
00:13:31,486 --> 00:13:33,181
Come on.

112
00:13:39,093 --> 00:13:41,357
Nice place.
Do you pay to live here?

113
00:13:41,496 --> 00:13:44,226
It's cheap. The manager
of my band found it for me.

114
00:13:44,933 --> 00:13:46,901
I suggest you find
a new manager.

115
00:13:47,035 --> 00:13:50,163
I'd love to, but we got this damn
contract with this sleazoid.

116
00:13:50,305 --> 00:13:52,899
He won't even give us
the money he owes us.

117
00:13:55,910 --> 00:13:57,969
Come on in.

118
00:14:00,515 --> 00:14:02,483
It's sort of a disaster area.

119
00:14:03,084 --> 00:14:05,109
We've been working on
some new songs, you know.

120
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:08,983
See, the band's called
Cherry Bomb and, well...

121
00:14:09,123 --> 00:14:13,082
we've been playing these grungy
mong-holes waiting for our big break.

122
00:14:15,463 --> 00:14:18,523
You don't have any idea what
I'm talking about, do you Mister...

123
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:21,726
- Hello.
- Duck?

124
00:14:22,036 --> 00:14:25,597
- It's Howard, thank you.
- Right, Howard.

125
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:27,603
Hi, I'm Beverly.

126
00:14:28,743 --> 00:14:32,736
Listen, would you like
something to eat or drink?

127
00:14:33,982 --> 00:14:37,213
Milk?
I could put it in a bowl.

128
00:14:38,219 --> 00:14:41,780
Doll, I don't drink out of bowls.
You got a beer?

129
00:14:42,056 --> 00:14:47,585
Beer?
Right, beer, right.

130
00:14:49,931 --> 00:14:52,058
God, I can't believe this.

131
00:14:53,268 --> 00:14:55,668
- I'll put you in a bowl.
- What?

132
00:14:56,537 --> 00:14:58,528
Give me a break.

133
00:15:01,276 --> 00:15:03,141
- What's this?
- It's a purse.

134
00:15:03,278 --> 00:15:05,803
- I got it at a swap meet.
- Cute.

135
00:15:07,915 --> 00:15:11,749
I'm sorry I'm so nervous. It's just
that I've never been around a...

136
00:15:12,954 --> 00:15:15,548
I mean, I've never even had
any pets or anything, you know?

137
00:15:15,690 --> 00:15:17,749
They seem like such a hassle.
You know, feeding them...

138
00:15:17,892 --> 00:15:21,760
- cleaning up their little poo-poos.
- I'll try to be careful.

139
00:15:21,896 --> 00:15:24,091
No, I didn't mean that you...

140
00:15:25,633 --> 00:15:27,567
Look, why don't
you just sit down...

141
00:15:27,702 --> 00:15:32,071
- Okay, why not?
- And make yourself at home.

142
00:15:32,206 --> 00:15:36,267
- Make myself at home? I wish.
- Listen.

143
00:15:37,612 --> 00:15:39,204
No, not again!

144
00:15:43,851 --> 00:15:48,049
Howard, it's okay.
Are you all right?

145
00:15:48,222 --> 00:15:52,852
- The chair started shaking.
- It was just a big truck going by.

146
00:15:54,462 --> 00:15:56,953
A truck?
I knew that.

147
00:15:58,232 --> 00:16:02,396
What I don't know is
what the hell I'm doing here!

148
00:16:03,271 --> 00:16:08,299
It's like a bad trip. I mean,
talk about an identity crisis.

149
00:16:08,509 --> 00:16:10,909
Yeah, what an awful
thing to happen.

150
00:16:11,079 --> 00:16:13,513
Howard, I was
just kinda wondering...

151
00:16:13,681 --> 00:16:17,048
does everybody
in your planet look like you?

152
00:16:17,185 --> 00:16:20,848
- Obviously, why?
- No reason, just wondered.

153
00:16:21,289 --> 00:16:24,383
So, what do you do back home?
You got a job? You go to school?

154
00:16:24,525 --> 00:16:27,892
- I went to med school for a while.
- You went to med school?

155
00:16:28,062 --> 00:16:30,622
Yeah, my parents
wanted me to be a doctor.

156
00:16:30,798 --> 00:16:35,462
Plastic surgeon, making big bucks,
doing big jobs, tail tucks.

157
00:16:35,703 --> 00:16:39,195
- What happened?
- I dropped out.

158
00:16:39,807 --> 00:16:43,470
And I decided to educate myself
in the real world, on the streets.

159
00:16:43,644 --> 00:16:46,977
So, I wrote songs at night
and did construction work by day.

160
00:16:47,148 --> 00:16:50,083
That sounds great.
You know, I write songs too.

161
00:16:50,218 --> 00:16:52,982
- What kind of...
- Listen, it doesn't matter.

162
00:16:53,121 --> 00:16:57,751
It was all a pipe dream.
I got so tired of everyone saying...

163
00:16:57,992 --> 00:17:01,689
"Grow up, Howard".
I guess I finally did.

164
00:17:01,863 --> 00:17:04,696
Last month I got what
they call a "promising job".

165
00:17:04,832 --> 00:17:08,563
- Yeah? Doing what?
- Advertising copywriter.

166
00:17:10,505 --> 00:17:16,501
Only two things touch my feathers,
this "Oil of Night Fowl" and him.

167
00:17:16,811 --> 00:17:18,506
I wrote that.

168
00:17:18,980 --> 00:17:24,748
Howard, it sort of sounds
like you sold out.

169
00:17:24,886 --> 00:17:28,652
Maybe. But sometimes
I still get this feeling...

170
00:17:28,790 --> 00:17:32,191
there's some kind of
special destiny waiting for me.

171
00:17:32,527 --> 00:17:34,961
Howard, that's it.
Maybe that's why you're here.

172
00:17:35,096 --> 00:17:36,290
- What?
- I mean, I believe that...

173
00:17:36,431 --> 00:17:38,126
there are no accidents
in the Universe.

174
00:17:38,266 --> 00:17:39,733
Maybe you're here
for some greater purpose.

175
00:17:39,934 --> 00:17:43,631
- Some cosmic cause.
- Are you nuts?

176
00:17:45,239 --> 00:17:48,231
I got no intention
of being stranded here.

177
00:17:48,376 --> 00:17:52,574
I gotta get back.
How, is another matter.

178
00:17:52,747 --> 00:17:56,877
Yeah, right.
We got get some help.

179
00:17:57,952 --> 00:18:00,284
But, Howard...

180
00:19:01,816 --> 00:19:04,148
Geez.

181
00:19:17,565 --> 00:19:20,159
Howard?

182
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:43,574
What am I gonna
do with you, Ducky?

183
00:20:11,072 --> 00:20:13,438
- This is humiliating.
- I just don't want people...

184
00:20:13,575 --> 00:20:16,601
- freaking out all over the place.
- What about me?

185
00:20:16,744 --> 00:20:18,507
I'm gonna have to see
a psychiatrist every day...

186
00:20:18,646 --> 00:20:21,080
- for the rest of my life.
- Relax, we're almost there.

187
00:20:21,215 --> 00:20:24,013
- Goody.
- Phil's a scientist. He can help.

188
00:20:27,488 --> 00:20:29,422
- Howard, this isn't working.
- Tell me about it.

189
00:20:29,557 --> 00:20:30,615
Can I give you
a hand with that.

190
00:20:30,758 --> 00:20:32,988
- No, we're doing...
- What's in the bag?

191
00:20:33,161 --> 00:20:34,924
I'm doing just fine,
thank you very much.

192
00:20:35,129 --> 00:20:36,824
Let me out of here.

193
00:20:37,498 --> 00:20:38,897
- Excuse me. Can I help with that?
- No!

194
00:20:39,033 --> 00:20:40,330
Yes!

195
00:20:41,402 --> 00:20:43,199
Why are we stopping?

196
00:20:44,105 --> 00:20:45,504
- Hi.
- Hi, Beverly.

197
00:20:45,673 --> 00:20:49,006
We had an appointment.
We got here as fast as we could.

198
00:21:01,589 --> 00:21:04,080
Listen, everybody, this is it!
I've just seen it!

199
00:21:04,225 --> 00:21:07,058
It's in there!
It's a...

200
00:21:09,430 --> 00:21:14,197
It's nothing!
It's nothing, never mind.

201
00:21:14,702 --> 00:21:16,397
Carry on, Dr. Chapin.

202
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:30,949
This is amazing.
Man's oldest fantasy.

203
00:21:31,386 --> 00:21:38,349
Across a sea of stars!
Look up in the sky!

204
00:21:38,559 --> 00:21:41,687
It's a bird!
It's a plane!

205
00:21:41,863 --> 00:21:47,130
- No, it's a duck!
- Phil, you gotta help us!

206
00:21:47,301 --> 00:21:51,032
- What are we gonna do?
- Nice, Ducky.

207
00:21:51,673 --> 00:21:58,169
Me, Phil, you Howard.
We be friends.

208
00:22:00,882 --> 00:22:05,376
Me Phil, you Howard.
We be friends.

209
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:08,546
Undoubtedly on of Earth's
greatest minds here.

210
00:22:09,691 --> 00:22:12,524
Phil, don't talk to him like that.
He's just as smart as you are.

211
00:22:12,694 --> 00:22:16,130
- Now I'm really depressed.
- Highly intelligent, perhaps even...

212
00:22:16,297 --> 00:22:18,731
Wait, that's it.
We're about to see...

213
00:22:18,866 --> 00:22:21,562
if subject has any abilities
we don't have on Earth, any...

214
00:22:21,703 --> 00:22:26,697
- What?
- Shall we say, super powers?

215
00:22:27,508 --> 00:22:32,138
Howard, can you bend this?

216
00:22:33,281 --> 00:22:35,749
- What are you, crazy?
- Howard...

217
00:22:36,584 --> 00:22:42,216
can you burn a hole through
this with some kind of eye laser?

218
00:22:42,390 --> 00:22:45,689
Can I bite your nose off
with my super bill?

219
00:22:45,827 --> 00:22:48,796
Howard, quit holding out.
I want you to concentrate...

220
00:22:48,930 --> 00:22:53,731
- and read my mind.
- Right. You're thinking...

221
00:22:53,868 --> 00:22:57,964
"They know I'm a phony.
They know I'm a yo-yo."

222
00:22:58,372 --> 00:23:00,636
Tell me if I'm warm
on any of these, Phil.

223
00:23:00,808 --> 00:23:04,369
I want you to look into the future
and tell me what you see.

224
00:23:04,512 --> 00:23:08,243
- I see myself walking out that door!
- Yeah, me too.

225
00:23:09,016 --> 00:23:12,144
- No, no, no, wait! You can't leave.
- Yeah, why not?

226
00:23:12,286 --> 00:23:14,754
Because there are papers
to be written, there's research...

227
00:23:14,889 --> 00:23:18,052
to be done and there's symposiums
to give, lecture tours.

228
00:23:18,192 --> 00:23:20,524
Howard, we are on our way
to the Science Hall of Fame.

229
00:23:20,661 --> 00:23:24,620
Look out Darwin! Look out Einstein!
Hello, Nobel Prize!

230
00:23:24,766 --> 00:23:26,825
We are not here to
make you famous, Blumburtt.

231
00:23:26,968 --> 00:23:28,492
Beverly, listen, I never
bad-mouthed others...

232
00:23:28,636 --> 00:23:31,161
in the scientific fraternity but
you bring in an alien in a bag...

233
00:23:31,305 --> 00:23:32,863
to most guys and
whamo they are talking.

234
00:23:33,007 --> 00:23:36,408
Let's cut him into little pieces and
see what color his organs are.

235
00:23:36,544 --> 00:23:38,603
I just wanna know,
"A", what I'm doing here...

236
00:23:38,746 --> 00:23:40,646
and "B",
how I'm gonna get back?

237
00:23:40,782 --> 00:23:42,943
Piece of cake.
"A" I'm just the guy to help...

238
00:23:43,117 --> 00:23:46,450
and that's because "B",
I've already got a theory.

239
00:23:46,554 --> 00:23:49,182
- What theory?
- Well, this is, of course...

240
00:23:49,323 --> 00:23:52,781
the evolutionary ladder
showing how man progressed...

241
00:23:52,927 --> 00:23:57,955
- from monkey, to me, for instance.
- You consider that progress?

242
00:23:58,666 --> 00:24:02,659
You're all hairless apes?
That's really disgusting.

243
00:24:02,837 --> 00:24:06,796
Now, I want you both to imagine
somewhere in the Universe...

244
00:24:06,974 --> 00:24:11,172
is Howard's world,
picture it in your mind.

245
00:24:11,345 --> 00:24:13,404
A world almost
exactly like ours...

246
00:24:13,581 --> 00:24:17,176
except that the progenitor
of the dominant species...

247
00:24:17,318 --> 00:24:22,950
- was not a monkey but a duck!
- Some theory.

248
00:24:23,124 --> 00:24:25,149
Every school duck
knows this stuff!

249
00:24:25,293 --> 00:24:29,525
And as duck climbed up
the evolutionary ladder...

250
00:24:29,730 --> 00:24:33,962
he said "Adios" to his wings.
His mental capacity increases.

251
00:24:34,135 --> 00:24:37,195
He begins to develop.
Beverly?

252
00:24:37,505 --> 00:24:40,941
- Shopping Malls?
- No, tribes.

253
00:24:41,242 --> 00:24:47,238
Cro-Magnon Duck, who
ultimately evolves into Howard.

254
00:24:47,548 --> 00:24:49,277
Blumburtt?
Blumburtt?

255
00:24:49,417 --> 00:24:51,180
- Come on!
- What the hell are you doing?

256
00:24:51,319 --> 00:24:53,719
- What?
- Don't move! Don't breathe!

257
00:24:54,121 --> 00:24:56,112
Did you finish cleaning
up the specimen lab?

258
00:24:56,757 --> 00:24:58,418
- Almost finished.
- Well, get down to...

259
00:24:58,559 --> 00:25:00,151
the Marine Lift Exhibit
with a mop.

260
00:25:00,294 --> 00:25:02,524
Some kid upchucked
all over the fern fossils.

261
00:25:02,897 --> 00:25:04,888
Right.
Good as done, Dr. Chapin.

262
00:25:05,733 --> 00:25:10,136
So, Philsey, you are
a scientist or a janitor?

263
00:25:10,438 --> 00:25:13,635
- I'm a lab assistant.
- That's terrific! Just perfect.

264
00:25:13,774 --> 00:25:15,332
- Yep, I'm out of here.
- Look, it's just a temporary job...

265
00:25:15,476 --> 00:25:17,273
until I finish school and
get my own museum.

266
00:25:17,411 --> 00:25:19,345
Yeah, stuffed you'd
make a great exhibit.

267
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:21,573
Howard!
Howard, wait!

268
00:25:24,418 --> 00:25:26,386
- Typical hairless ape.
- Howard, look, come on...

269
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:28,715
don't flutter off in a huff!
Beverly, listen, I've got...

270
00:25:28,856 --> 00:25:31,586
some important matters to clean up
here, but I'll call you tonight.

271
00:25:31,759 --> 00:25:34,990
I'll figure out a way
to help Howard, I swear.

272
00:25:35,129 --> 00:25:36,756
Just don't show him
to anybody else!

273
00:25:36,898 --> 00:25:38,695
Yeah, they look hungry.
Get them a banana.

274
00:25:38,833 --> 00:25:41,199
Hide him!
Take him to a movie!

275
00:25:41,335 --> 00:25:43,667
Look, I didn't know
where else to go for help.

276
00:25:43,838 --> 00:25:45,806
- Inside, Blumburtt.
- Coming. Coming.

277
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:47,530
Howard, why are
you so pissed off?

278
00:25:47,675 --> 00:25:52,135
Why? Listen, if you got blasted
millions of miles through space...

279
00:25:52,346 --> 00:25:54,177
ended up on another
planet and were given...

280
00:25:54,315 --> 00:25:58,479
an I.Q. Test by a janitor,
you'd be pissed off too!

281
00:25:58,719 --> 00:26:00,710
Look, maybe you are trapped
in a world you never made...

282
00:26:00,855 --> 00:26:04,791
but, I got problems of my own.
My whole career is falling apart.

283
00:26:04,959 --> 00:26:08,258
Your career?
What about my life?

284
00:26:08,696 --> 00:26:12,462
- I'm stranded here, ship wrecked!
- Look at this wonderful exhibit.

285
00:26:12,633 --> 00:26:15,124
You see what I mean?
I'm a freak. An outcast.

286
00:26:15,303 --> 00:26:18,670
- It's so life-like and realistic.
- Bug off.

287
00:26:19,106 --> 00:26:21,574
- Excuse me?
- I said, "beat it".

288
00:26:24,245 --> 00:26:26,736
Mutants.
You, too.

289
00:26:26,881 --> 00:26:30,044
- Leave me alone!
- What?

290
00:26:30,251 --> 00:26:34,688
I don't need any more of
your sympathy, your charity!

291
00:26:35,790 --> 00:26:39,419
Okay. Okay, fine.
I mean, I just found something...

292
00:26:39,627 --> 00:26:44,064
I meet somebody in a pretty weird
predicament and I was trying to help.

293
00:26:45,099 --> 00:26:49,866
But if that's the way you want it,
then so long, Ducky!

294
00:26:50,671 --> 00:26:53,105
Don't shed any
tears over me, Toots!

295
00:26:53,274 --> 00:26:55,071
You can wallow
in your own self pity!

296
00:26:55,209 --> 00:26:57,177
Right!
Well, who needs you?

297
00:26:57,311 --> 00:27:00,508
- I don't need anybody!
- Yeah, right.

298
00:27:01,916 --> 00:27:03,816
Yeah.

299
00:27:07,188 --> 00:27:12,455
Damn it! I can't sit here on my tail
feathers feeling sorry for myself.

300
00:27:12,660 --> 00:27:15,185
I've got to think
about practical matter.

301
00:27:15,329 --> 00:27:19,026
Food, shelter, a job.

302
00:27:27,875 --> 00:27:32,244
Now you do know
why you were sent to me?

303
00:27:32,380 --> 00:27:35,406
My continuing
streak of bad luck?

304
00:27:36,650 --> 00:27:39,414
You've been sent to me because
I'm famous for finding job...

305
00:27:39,553 --> 00:27:42,886
for little slackers like you.
That's right.

306
00:27:43,057 --> 00:27:46,515
They send me all the psycho cases.
All the misfits.

307
00:27:46,627 --> 00:27:49,528
All the phonies and
the fakers who think that...

308
00:27:49,663 --> 00:27:51,528
by traipsing in here
looking outlandish...

309
00:27:51,665 --> 00:27:54,031
they're not gonna
be able to find work!

310
00:27:54,168 --> 00:27:57,831
It's my fault I gotta shoplift at
the little tyke section of goodwill?

311
00:27:57,972 --> 00:28:01,703
I'm not talking about your clothes,
I'm talking about your face.

312
00:28:02,043 --> 00:28:05,444
You think that by looking
controversial, you're never...

313
00:28:05,579 --> 00:28:09,345
gonna find a job and just
go on collecting unemployment...

314
00:28:09,483 --> 00:28:11,542
and living happy
on the public dough.

315
00:28:11,719 --> 00:28:14,882
Well, dude, you've got
another think coming!

316
00:28:15,022 --> 00:28:17,855
Because Cora Mae always
places her interviewee.

317
00:28:19,827 --> 00:28:21,818
I'm gonna
find your ass a job.

318
00:28:21,962 --> 00:28:27,662
That'll wipe that snarl right off
your face, little whatever you is.

319
00:28:28,669 --> 00:28:32,935
In fact, I think I got
just the position for you!

320
00:28:39,613 --> 00:28:44,482
I got a feeling you're gonna take
to this job like a duck to water.

321
00:28:54,028 --> 00:28:56,724
Towels, lotion?

322
00:28:57,298 --> 00:28:59,266
Antibiotics?

323
00:29:07,441 --> 00:29:09,466
It must mating season.

324
00:29:13,581 --> 00:29:18,518
Creepy little dude.
Shorty?

325
00:29:20,354 --> 00:29:24,552
It's Howard, thank you,
and I'm taking a break.

326
00:29:25,226 --> 00:29:26,818
Pardon me,
Your Aloneness...

327
00:29:26,961 --> 00:29:31,728
but we seem to have a plugged
up airjet in number five.

328
00:29:31,866 --> 00:29:36,394
- And?
- And since you are supposed...

329
00:29:36,537 --> 00:29:41,668
to be the water expert I asked for,
you are going to fix it!

330
00:29:42,676 --> 00:29:44,007
No!

331
00:29:44,278 --> 00:29:45,836
No, no, no, wait, wait.
I got a better Idea!

332
00:29:45,980 --> 00:29:48,414
Wait, wait.
I can't swim!

333
00:29:48,549 --> 00:29:50,540
Kid, guess I slipped.

334
00:30:01,162 --> 00:30:03,255
Don't mind me.

335
00:30:08,068 --> 00:30:11,037
Oh, I leave that creepy little dude
in here to clean this place up...

336
00:30:11,172 --> 00:30:13,197
How am I supposed to run
a class...

337
00:30:14,775 --> 00:30:16,709
Guess I slipped.

338
00:30:17,144 --> 00:30:19,578
Just came by to tell you...

339
00:30:19,747 --> 00:30:21,442
I quit!

340
00:31:01,355 --> 00:31:03,619
Excuse me.
Getting off. My stop.

341
00:31:04,091 --> 00:31:07,288
Hi, there. How are you?
Good to see you.

342
00:31:08,529 --> 00:31:11,259
Yeah, same to you!

343
00:31:11,432 --> 00:31:13,525
Urban jungle!
Geez!

344
00:31:14,802 --> 00:31:16,599
- What is that?
- That's a duck...

345
00:31:16,737 --> 00:31:19,103
- What is that thing?
- That's a duck, man!

346
00:31:19,907 --> 00:31:23,001
Forecasting our week of fair weather
for you duck hunters...

347
00:31:23,143 --> 00:31:26,909
- for what reported, Steve Cannelli.
- Well, Bob...

348
00:31:27,047 --> 00:31:30,073
it's time to dust off those decoys
and practice that squawking...

349
00:31:30,251 --> 00:31:32,742
because duck hunting season
has officially opened.

350
00:31:32,886 --> 00:31:34,114
- Duck hunting?
- The Live Wild Commission...

351
00:31:34,255 --> 00:31:36,780
has actually doubled the limit
of ducks that can be shot.

352
00:31:36,924 --> 00:31:38,186
Shot?

353
00:31:42,496 --> 00:31:45,431
This Duck has come to America
with Duck A Roni.

354
00:31:45,566 --> 00:31:46,999
No!

355
00:31:47,167 --> 00:31:49,261
But if every hunter could blast
fifteen of those in the sky...

356
00:31:49,568 --> 00:31:52,594
Hey, buddy, what's the rush?

357
00:33:36,008 --> 00:33:38,499
This way is too depressing.

358
00:33:41,913 --> 00:33:43,540
Give me a beat!

359
00:33:44,116 --> 00:33:46,448
One, two, three, four!

360
00:33:51,490 --> 00:33:53,720
Honey, I love you!
I love you!

361
00:33:53,925 --> 00:33:58,123
I'm right here. Beverly, I'm yours
after the show. Alright.

362
00:34:01,166 --> 00:34:06,297
- Here's the money for the girls.
- I'll make sure they get it.

363
00:34:07,606 --> 00:34:09,904
- Yeah, I'll bet. When?
- When?

364
00:34:10,075 --> 00:34:12,942
When Beaudacious Beverly stops
holding out to me.

365
00:34:13,145 --> 00:34:14,203
I'm gonna invite her up
to my place tonight...

366
00:34:14,346 --> 00:34:16,814
for a little
career manipulation.

367
00:34:19,318 --> 00:34:24,517
I guess you must be the girls'
manager. And if you are...

368
00:34:24,856 --> 00:34:27,916
I don't like the way you're talking
about Beverly.

369
00:34:28,593 --> 00:34:31,391
And I want the girl's money!

370
00:34:31,530 --> 00:34:34,795
- Ritchie? Would you... What is that?
- Oh, look, Ginger...

371
00:34:34,933 --> 00:34:37,424
I warned you when you got into
Rock Management...

372
00:34:37,569 --> 00:34:39,901
you'd be dealing with
entertainment types.

373
00:34:40,038 --> 00:34:42,666
You know, different strokes
and all that?

374
00:34:42,841 --> 00:34:47,175
Different life styles is one thing,
different life forms is another.

375
00:34:53,485 --> 00:34:57,182
I'm not in a real good mood
tonight, Ginger.

376
00:34:57,322 --> 00:34:59,790
I want the girls' money.

377
00:34:59,958 --> 00:35:04,224
Now, is this gonna be easy...

378
00:35:05,330 --> 00:35:10,029
- or is this gonna be trouble?
- Hey, Ritchie...

379
00:35:10,235 --> 00:35:14,331
tell it to go away. I'm not up all
my barnyard languages.

380
00:35:14,573 --> 00:35:17,736
Okay, Duck, out! You're gone!
You're history!

381
00:35:17,876 --> 00:35:20,037
You little wise pecker!

382
00:35:20,178 --> 00:35:22,043
Arrevidici, Duck!

383
00:35:25,283 --> 00:35:28,616
- Mallard in the side pocket.
- Adios, quack man.

384
00:35:29,388 --> 00:35:31,049
Very nicely done.

385
00:35:33,225 --> 00:35:35,591
Hey, what's going on
out there now?

386
00:35:49,808 --> 00:35:55,041
- All right, now it's my turn!
- Hey, come on, Duck!

387
00:35:55,180 --> 00:35:56,704
Take your best shot!

388
00:35:58,383 --> 00:36:00,783
- You got it!
- Ritchie!

389
00:36:10,295 --> 00:36:12,195
Stuck-a-bob!

390
00:36:16,334 --> 00:36:17,392
No!

391
00:36:23,575 --> 00:36:27,443
No earring in your other ear?
I'll just make the hole myself.

392
00:36:27,579 --> 00:36:29,843
No, please, man, no,
man, please! Don't!

393
00:36:29,981 --> 00:36:31,414
- The money!
- Sure. Sure, here!

394
00:36:31,550 --> 00:36:33,950
You take the money!
Take it! It's your! Take it!

395
00:36:34,085 --> 00:36:37,020
And, you're no longer
their manager!

396
00:36:37,155 --> 00:36:39,419
Listen, okay.
Everybody in here is a witness.

397
00:36:39,591 --> 00:36:42,025
I'm letting the girls out of
their contract, okay?

398
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:44,128
- Tell your goons to stay back!
- I'm warning you!

399
00:36:44,262 --> 00:36:46,025
- Get back, Ritchie!
- I bite your face...

400
00:36:46,164 --> 00:36:48,962
- you're a dead man, Ginger!
- What are you talking about?

401
00:36:49,100 --> 00:36:51,728
Space rabies!

402
00:36:51,870 --> 00:36:54,498
- Ritchie, is that a real disease?
- I don't know, Ging...

403
00:36:54,639 --> 00:36:56,766
I heard something about
that on the news.

404
00:36:56,908 --> 00:37:00,969
That's right, Space Rabies!
Yeah, one bite, and...

405
00:37:01,112 --> 00:37:05,071
it's agonizing death in 15 seconds.
Bite, bite. Bite!

406
00:37:11,690 --> 00:37:14,158
We're all music lovers, huh?

407
00:37:16,161 --> 00:37:17,822
What a guy.

408
00:37:19,698 --> 00:37:22,633
- Those guys are a bunch of fools.
- Obviously the wrong crowd.

409
00:37:22,767 --> 00:37:25,895
I'm running out of sticks to
throw at these people! Sucks!

410
00:37:26,171 --> 00:37:28,298
- Now who?
- Look, tell him to go away.

411
00:37:33,178 --> 00:37:37,615
Down here, doll.
Is Beverly in?

412
00:37:38,583 --> 00:37:41,711
Geez, you must be K. C...

413
00:37:42,187 --> 00:37:45,645
- Meet Howard.
- Hi, oh, Howie.

414
00:37:46,157 --> 00:37:49,593
We've heard so much about you.
Of course, we didn't believe it.

415
00:37:49,995 --> 00:37:52,691
How weird.

416
00:37:54,332 --> 00:37:56,493
- Hi you, Ducky.
- Hi, Toots.

417
00:37:56,635 --> 00:37:58,364
How's the world been
treating you?

418
00:37:59,638 --> 00:38:03,199
- Guess.
- I was worried about you.

419
00:38:03,375 --> 00:38:05,843
- I missed you.
- Well, sex appeal...

420
00:38:05,977 --> 00:38:07,535
some guys got it...

421
00:38:07,712 --> 00:38:10,840
- and some guys don't.
- Howard?

422
00:38:11,583 --> 00:38:15,075
Listen, I'm sorry we fought.
You're the only friend...

423
00:38:15,220 --> 00:38:17,017
I've got here.

424
00:38:21,259 --> 00:38:24,524
Hi, sorry I missed the show.
I came to watch you undress, though.

425
00:38:24,696 --> 00:38:26,891
And I brought a pizza.

426
00:38:27,032 --> 00:38:28,829
Howard!

427
00:38:31,636 --> 00:38:33,331
Boy!

428
00:38:33,538 --> 00:38:35,267
Thank God you're back.
I've been working on...

429
00:38:35,407 --> 00:38:38,137
- the mystery of your arrival.
- What's he doing here?

430
00:38:38,310 --> 00:38:40,642
Well, he and Ronette have sort
of got back together.

431
00:38:40,779 --> 00:38:43,942
I don't know who's more desperate
for dates, you or me.

432
00:38:44,115 --> 00:38:45,514
What?

433
00:38:45,650 --> 00:38:48,380
Anyway, Howard, I was talking
to some Astro-physicists.

434
00:38:48,520 --> 00:38:50,681
You know, the guys who discovered
that Aztecs came from Mars?

435
00:38:50,855 --> 00:38:52,288
- Well, these guys concluded...
- No!

436
00:38:52,490 --> 00:38:54,685
That you arrived here in a space
craft millions of years ago, and...

437
00:38:54,826 --> 00:38:57,454
- must've remained frozen in ice.
- Go away!

438
00:38:57,629 --> 00:38:59,358
Ronette, could you
shut this boy up?

439
00:38:59,531 --> 00:39:01,123
- Howard...
- What's a pizza?

440
00:39:01,266 --> 00:39:03,234
It's a circular Italian food object.
Howard...

441
00:39:03,401 --> 00:39:05,699
I didn't buy that theory either,
so I did some research...

442
00:39:05,837 --> 00:39:09,068
and I discovered an ancient race
of large ducks worshipped by...

443
00:39:09,207 --> 00:39:12,574
- primitive Somoans.
- Leave me alone!

444
00:39:13,712 --> 00:39:17,307
I was barking up the wrong tree.
I knew that. But...

445
00:39:17,449 --> 00:39:20,748
tonight I am getting concrete
evidence about how you got here.

446
00:39:21,419 --> 00:39:23,819
Wait a minute.
Oh, I gotta make a call.

447
00:39:24,789 --> 00:39:26,916
- Phil?
- No sex now, I'm working.

448
00:39:27,058 --> 00:39:28,855
Got a place to stay tonight?

449
00:39:34,599 --> 00:39:37,568
Yeah, by the way I forgot.
I had a little talk...

450
00:39:37,702 --> 00:39:40,500
- with your manager Ginger?
- You talked to that slime?

451
00:39:40,639 --> 00:39:43,267
- What for?
- I got your money from him.

452
00:39:43,608 --> 00:39:45,473
Ducky, I can't believe this.

453
00:39:45,644 --> 00:39:49,307
I also got him to agree that it
was time for him to step aside...

454
00:39:49,447 --> 00:39:50,937
- as your manager.
- What?

455
00:39:51,116 --> 00:39:53,676
- You got rid of Ginger?
- Mr. Duck, you're wonderful.

456
00:39:54,919 --> 00:39:56,750
This is it!
I'm out of here!

457
00:39:56,888 --> 00:39:58,150
- Good.
- Howard...

458
00:39:58,289 --> 00:40:00,348
I'm about to meet secretly
with my colleague...

459
00:40:00,492 --> 00:40:03,086
- and he's bringing The Feather.
- What feather?

460
00:40:03,228 --> 00:40:05,059
- What are you talking...
- If it matches...

461
00:40:05,263 --> 00:40:07,163
- it'll be the answer to your problems.
- Matches?

462
00:40:07,298 --> 00:40:09,129
No, you don't!
Stay away from me!

463
00:40:09,300 --> 00:40:10,790
- You leave him alone!
- Let me through!

464
00:40:11,903 --> 00:40:13,495
Philip, you're a drip!

465
00:40:13,972 --> 00:40:16,941
I'm about to unravel
the mystery of your arrival!

466
00:40:17,108 --> 00:40:20,407
- Come back here, your hairless ape!
- You'll have time to thank me later!

467
00:40:20,545 --> 00:40:22,945
- Get out of here!
- We're gonna be famous.

468
00:40:23,181 --> 00:40:26,639
- Are you okay?
- Ah, it's just my pride.

469
00:40:26,818 --> 00:40:28,718
We'll go home, Ducky.

470
00:41:15,867 --> 00:41:17,164
All right.

471
00:41:23,775 --> 00:41:24,935
Hey!

472
00:41:26,244 --> 00:41:29,577
- Little tune, I never finished.
- You play pretty good.

473
00:41:29,914 --> 00:41:33,850
I had a group in high school.
Howard and the Heartbreakers.

474
00:41:34,219 --> 00:41:39,054
Oh, heavy, Howard, very heavy.
Maybe you should be our manager.

475
00:41:40,291 --> 00:41:42,088
Wait a second.

476
00:41:43,361 --> 00:41:46,228
Maybe you're just the kind
of bazaar influence we need.

477
00:41:46,364 --> 00:41:51,563
- Forget it. No more jobs here.
- I think you'd be a great manager.

478
00:41:51,703 --> 00:41:55,434
- I'm gonna suggest it to the girls.
- I've given up trying to assimilate.

479
00:41:55,874 --> 00:41:58,342
I've gotta get back
to my own kind.

480
00:41:59,010 --> 00:42:01,706
Although...

481
00:42:01,946 --> 00:42:04,278
I have developed a greater
appreciation...

482
00:42:04,449 --> 00:42:07,043
for the female version of the
human anatomy.

483
00:42:08,153 --> 00:42:10,781
Howard,
you really are the worst.

484
00:42:12,023 --> 00:42:14,651
Come on,
let's watch David Letterman.

485
00:42:15,493 --> 00:42:16,892
Come on.

486
00:42:17,195 --> 00:42:18,958
- Okey-dokey.
- You know...

487
00:42:19,097 --> 00:42:21,327
I got a felling my life's really
gonna change...

488
00:42:21,466 --> 00:42:24,492
- since you fell into it, Ducky.
- Yeah, well...

489
00:42:24,669 --> 00:42:27,137
- I'm glad somebody's happy.
- If I could just get...

490
00:42:27,272 --> 00:42:29,001
my career back on course
I'd only have...

491
00:42:29,140 --> 00:42:31,074
the old standard worry left.

492
00:42:31,209 --> 00:42:32,767
- What's that?
- I just can't seem...

493
00:42:32,911 --> 00:42:36,711
- to find the right man.
- Maybe it's not a man...

494
00:42:36,848 --> 00:42:38,839
you should be looking for.

495
00:42:40,518 --> 00:42:44,284
You think I might find happiness
in the animal kingdom, Ducky?

496
00:42:44,455 --> 00:42:50,485
Like they say, doll, love's strange.
We could always give it a try.

497
00:42:56,668 --> 00:42:58,158
Okay...

498
00:42:58,636 --> 00:43:01,104
Let's go for it, Mr. Macho.

499
00:43:01,472 --> 00:43:04,407
What do you mean? Okay?
It was a joke.

500
00:43:06,344 --> 00:43:10,678
- Listen, I'm pretty tired.
- It's just that you're so...

501
00:43:10,815 --> 00:43:15,377
- incredibly soft and cuddly.
- Bev, let's be realistic.

502
00:43:15,587 --> 00:43:18,579
I mean, my apartment's zillions
of miles from here.

503
00:43:19,424 --> 00:43:23,121
- You're three feet taller that I am.
- I just can't resist...

504
00:43:23,294 --> 00:43:26,195
your intense
animal magnetism.

505
00:43:29,567 --> 00:43:33,264
Anyway, where will it all lead?
Marriage, kids...

506
00:43:33,471 --> 00:43:37,601
- a house in the suburbs?
- Let's just face it.

507
00:43:37,775 --> 00:43:40,437
- It's fate.
- No, it's not!

508
00:43:42,180 --> 00:43:46,048
- I've got a headache.
- And I've got the aspirin.

509
00:43:46,784 --> 00:43:48,376
Be gentle.

510
00:43:48,953 --> 00:43:52,013
Just one good night kiss
sweet Ducky?

511
00:43:53,858 --> 00:43:56,918
Come on, Howard,
I was just kidding.

512
00:43:57,462 --> 00:43:58,520
Good night.

513
00:44:15,680 --> 00:44:17,978
My God.
This relationship...

514
00:44:18,149 --> 00:44:21,414
- it defies all the laws of nature.
- No, it doesn't.

515
00:44:21,586 --> 00:44:25,044
This is not what you think.
We're just very good friends.

516
00:44:26,591 --> 00:44:29,321
- Phil?
- I'm sorry. The door was open.

517
00:44:29,494 --> 00:44:32,691
- Who the hell are they?
- This is my friend Carter...

518
00:44:32,964 --> 00:44:36,627
and, this is Dr. Walter Jenning.
And I told them all about you...

519
00:44:36,768 --> 00:44:39,032
- Howard.
- You were obviously right.

520
00:44:39,203 --> 00:44:41,967
- Show, show him the evidence.
- What evidence?

521
00:44:42,340 --> 00:44:45,571
We tested them, and they're both
from the same fowl.

522
00:44:45,944 --> 00:44:47,241
You, Howard.

523
00:44:48,046 --> 00:44:51,641
- My feathers?
- Howard, Howard, don't go beserk!

524
00:44:51,783 --> 00:44:53,683
- No!
- On my planet, we never say die...

525
00:44:53,818 --> 00:44:55,945
- we say kill!
- Now, wait a minute.

526
00:44:56,087 --> 00:44:57,952
Listen to me, Small Visitor.

527
00:44:59,290 --> 00:45:02,225
I can explain
how you got here.

528
00:45:04,062 --> 00:45:07,327
Dr Jenning is in charge of the
Astro-Physics Lab at Dyna-Technics.

529
00:45:07,699 --> 00:45:10,190
- Now, on the night of September 18th.
- That's the night Howard landed.

530
00:45:10,335 --> 00:45:13,827
Yes, now on that night we were
initiating our first full scale...

531
00:45:14,005 --> 00:45:16,940
- test of the Laser Spectra scope.
- It was shot during the experiment.

532
00:45:17,141 --> 00:45:19,439
It was just a routine procedure
meant to measure...

533
00:45:19,610 --> 00:45:22,636
the density of the gases that
surround the Alpha Centauri.

534
00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:26,008
However, part way through the
experiment, there was a...

535
00:45:26,150 --> 00:45:27,742
a deviation and...

536
00:45:28,152 --> 00:45:31,053
we lost control of the
laser spectra scope.

537
00:45:31,189 --> 00:45:35,489
- What do you mean "lost control"?
- Some unknown force...

538
00:45:35,626 --> 00:45:39,255
was re-directing the laser beam from
its original target so that it hit...

539
00:45:39,397 --> 00:45:41,627
- your planet instead.
- Hit my planet?

540
00:45:41,766 --> 00:45:45,327
How about hitting my living room?
Talk about an invasion of privacy?

541
00:45:45,503 --> 00:45:48,563
When the beam hit, you must have
been caught up in a massive...

542
00:45:48,706 --> 00:45:52,233
energy inversion, which literally
dragged you through space...

543
00:45:52,377 --> 00:45:54,743
back to the power source
here on earth.

544
00:45:54,912 --> 00:45:57,642
- Radical.
- In the lab that night...

545
00:45:57,782 --> 00:46:00,649
we saw a single feather fall.

546
00:46:07,158 --> 00:46:09,149
We weren't aware that the rest
of you, Howard...

547
00:46:09,293 --> 00:46:13,354
had landed in that alley just
two miles away. Any questions?

548
00:46:13,498 --> 00:46:16,160
Yeah.
Where are my pants?

549
00:46:17,201 --> 00:46:19,294
- Howard, where you going?
- To this lab of theirs.

550
00:46:19,470 --> 00:46:21,199
- What for?
- To hop back on board...

551
00:46:21,372 --> 00:46:24,466
that laser thing. Then all you have
to do is hit the reverse lever...

552
00:46:24,642 --> 00:46:26,610
to send me back home.
Right?

553
00:46:26,744 --> 00:46:29,269
Well, we hadn't considered
reversing the process.

554
00:46:29,414 --> 00:46:30,813
- I, I don't think it's feasible.
- Me, either.

555
00:46:30,948 --> 00:46:32,848
Now, wait a minute.
If we could generate...

556
00:46:32,984 --> 00:46:35,509
- a strong enough hyper-charge...
- You can't do that.

557
00:46:35,653 --> 00:46:38,383
You mean the reflex mode might
provoke a total reversal?

558
00:46:38,523 --> 00:46:40,320
- Itjust might be possible.
- It won't work.

559
00:46:40,458 --> 00:46:41,618
- Yeah.
- Sir.

560
00:46:41,759 --> 00:46:43,852
Don't, don't listen to them, Howard.
I have got you booked...

561
00:46:43,995 --> 00:46:47,931
on A.M. Cleveland. We can get the
cover of Science Digest. We, we...

562
00:46:48,099 --> 00:46:49,862
- Butt Out, four-eyes.
- Yeah.

563
00:46:50,134 --> 00:46:52,830
Look, you guys, could you
really send him back?

564
00:46:53,004 --> 00:46:56,167
If we did, we could establish a
continuing link between our planets.

565
00:46:56,307 --> 00:46:59,470
But, he would have to leave tonight
while the alignment still exists.

566
00:46:59,610 --> 00:47:01,202
- We can't afford to wait.
- You mean...

567
00:47:01,345 --> 00:47:03,336
I'm finally gonna breeze
this fly trap?

568
00:47:03,481 --> 00:47:06,348
Ducky, this is what you wanted.
You're going home.

569
00:47:06,484 --> 00:47:07,576
- Yeah.
- Right.

570
00:47:07,718 --> 00:47:10,516
Carter, call Larry have him set up
the initiation procedure.

571
00:47:10,721 --> 00:47:12,814
Tell him I'll meet him at the lab
right away. You and Blumburtt...

572
00:47:12,957 --> 00:47:16,358
can bring Howard. You are about to
make history a second time...

573
00:47:16,494 --> 00:47:18,689
- my little friend.
- Thanks...

574
00:47:18,863 --> 00:47:20,660
but once was plenty.

575
00:47:21,332 --> 00:47:22,264
- Get to it.
- Right.

576
00:47:22,400 --> 00:47:26,200
You know, Howard, we could
hold out for a PBS special.

577
00:47:26,337 --> 00:47:27,201
Phil!

578
00:47:27,839 --> 00:47:30,808
Bev, get dressed. Aren't
you gonna see me off?

579
00:47:30,942 --> 00:47:34,173
Sure I am. I just hope they
let you take a carry-on bag.

580
00:47:34,712 --> 00:47:37,977
Look, I'm gonna put on these
Polaroids that we took at the Club.

581
00:47:38,149 --> 00:47:40,913
Thanks.
These'll help...

582
00:47:41,085 --> 00:47:43,747
or the guys back home
are never gonna believe me.

583
00:47:45,389 --> 00:47:49,689
- What's this in my bag?
- Souvenirs?

584
00:47:51,095 --> 00:47:55,122
- I'm gonna miss you a lot, Ducky.
- Bev...

585
00:47:55,266 --> 00:47:58,326
I don't belong here.
You know I've gotta go.

586
00:48:00,738 --> 00:48:02,069
Yeah.

587
00:48:13,651 --> 00:48:17,109
Lily had the dolphins.
Cousteau, the whales.

588
00:48:17,488 --> 00:48:21,083
Goudall gorillas.
I had a duck.

589
00:48:22,627 --> 00:48:24,925
I could have been
a contender.

590
00:48:27,965 --> 00:48:32,493
Bev?
I'm not a real sentimental guy.

591
00:48:33,070 --> 00:48:38,201
No, I bet you were born from
a very hard-boiled egg, Ducky.

592
00:48:39,143 --> 00:48:42,544
Yeah. But, I do keep wondering...

593
00:48:42,713 --> 00:48:46,649
of all the alleys in the world
I could have fallen into that night.

594
00:48:46,884 --> 00:48:51,412
Why did it have to be yours?
Because, right now...

595
00:48:51,923 --> 00:48:56,326
you're the one and only thing that's
making it very hard for me to leave.

596
00:49:11,275 --> 00:49:14,005
- There's no guard.
- We should go back then?

597
00:49:14,145 --> 00:49:14,770
Phil?

598
00:49:15,012 --> 00:49:16,502
- What?
- Drive.

599
00:49:34,198 --> 00:49:36,098
What are these alarms?

600
00:49:36,234 --> 00:49:37,633
- Something's happened.
- What's happened?

601
00:49:37,768 --> 00:49:38,735
I don't know.

602
00:49:38,970 --> 00:49:41,939
- That is really cool.
- Right. Hold it!

603
00:49:42,106 --> 00:49:43,664
Security!

604
00:49:46,043 --> 00:49:51,242
My eyes! My eyes! It exploded again!
It was terrible!

605
00:49:51,382 --> 00:49:54,408
We have no right to tamper
with the Universe.

606
00:49:57,688 --> 00:50:00,486
This does not hold well.

607
00:50:04,662 --> 00:50:05,788
Is he okay?

608
00:50:12,403 --> 00:50:15,201
Get out of the way!
- It's still hot!

609
00:50:15,339 --> 00:50:18,103
Get them out of here!
Head for the emergency exists.

610
00:50:34,191 --> 00:50:35,783
Howard, where are you going?

611
00:50:36,227 --> 00:50:38,161
- Larry, where's Dr. Jenning?
- Carter, come here.

612
00:50:38,296 --> 00:50:39,524
Let me show you this.

613
00:50:39,697 --> 00:50:41,824
He was pre-activating the
laser spectra-scope...

614
00:50:42,099 --> 00:50:44,567
we lost control again and there
was another explosion.

615
00:50:44,702 --> 00:50:46,966
And, Jenning caught the full
force of the blast this time.

616
00:50:47,338 --> 00:50:49,568
- Is he all right? Where is he?
- You, you see the bottom...

617
00:50:49,707 --> 00:50:52,642
of the spectra scope, blew it
to the wall and Jenning just...

618
00:50:52,777 --> 00:50:55,541
- just disappeared.
- Excuse me.

619
00:50:55,713 --> 00:50:58,079
But is this gonna delay
my take-off?

620
00:50:58,416 --> 00:51:02,648
Is, is that it?
That's unbelievable!

621
00:51:03,020 --> 00:51:05,716
Yeah. We brought Howard down
the first time, but what if...

622
00:51:06,424 --> 00:51:10,121
God, Larry what if we brought down
something else this time?

623
00:51:13,030 --> 00:51:14,930
We're rounding up all the scientists
for you in the lab, sir...

624
00:51:15,066 --> 00:51:16,397
but I think you better take a look
at this other...

625
00:51:16,534 --> 00:51:20,630
- this other thing first.
- A thing... Hansen?

626
00:51:20,971 --> 00:51:23,337
Is that kind of precise,
descriptive techniques...

627
00:51:23,474 --> 00:51:26,102
they're teaching Rookies
nowadays? A thing?

628
00:51:26,243 --> 00:51:28,006
I, I wanna know what they're
doing with Howard in there?

629
00:51:28,612 --> 00:51:31,513
- Excuse me, are you in charge here?
- Yeah. Why?

630
00:51:31,682 --> 00:51:33,912
Well, I wanna know why they're
harassing Howard.

631
00:51:34,051 --> 00:51:34,983
Who's Howard?

632
00:51:35,152 --> 00:51:38,053
He had nothing to do with it.
Howard, Howard is just an innocent.

633
00:51:38,556 --> 00:51:41,116
- Thing?
- No, Duck!

634
00:51:42,026 --> 00:51:43,755
Just an innocent duck?

635
00:51:44,328 --> 00:51:46,057
They wonder why I'm asking
for an early retirement...

636
00:51:46,197 --> 00:51:48,893
- you deal with this.
- Wait a second, you can't...

637
00:51:49,200 --> 00:51:51,691
Herbie, you got
a 'thing' in here?

638
00:51:52,269 --> 00:51:53,668
Thing.

639
00:51:54,872 --> 00:51:57,636
I've had enough!
I wanna see my lawyer.

640
00:52:00,111 --> 00:52:02,909
I've got rights, you know?
I'm suing.

641
00:52:03,047 --> 00:52:04,480
Yeah.

642
00:52:05,750 --> 00:52:07,615
Goddamnit, Hansen, get in here
and get this friggen duck suit...

643
00:52:07,752 --> 00:52:09,014
- of this nut!
- Okay, sir.

644
00:52:11,389 --> 00:52:14,483
Hey, hey, let me go!
You big oafs!

645
00:52:14,625 --> 00:52:17,423
On my planet we never say...
die, we say...

646
00:52:17,661 --> 00:52:18,855
not my shorts!

647
00:52:21,031 --> 00:52:22,464
You perverts!

648
00:52:23,367 --> 00:52:25,927
- Lieutenant?
- Lieutenant, there's no zipper.

649
00:52:26,070 --> 00:52:27,935
There's no buttons.
No Velcro, sir.

650
00:52:28,105 --> 00:52:30,869
I think the suspect's
stuff is like inboard, sir.

651
00:52:31,308 --> 00:52:34,835
- Yeah. I, I think he's for real.
- If your goons are finished!

652
00:52:34,979 --> 00:52:36,173
Let go on me!

653
00:52:37,548 --> 00:52:41,143
I'd like a word with those
so-called scientists out there!

654
00:52:41,285 --> 00:52:43,378
- Oh, yeah? What about?
- About when they can rev up...

655
00:52:43,454 --> 00:52:46,389
- that machine and send me back home.
- Listen, Howard...

656
00:52:46,524 --> 00:52:48,424
I'm gonna go talk to
the scientists out there.

657
00:52:48,559 --> 00:52:50,993
You are gonna go play sitting
duck in a jail cell.

658
00:52:51,128 --> 00:52:54,791
- Lieutenant, what's the charge, sir?
- IIlegal alien.

659
00:52:55,933 --> 00:52:57,093
Come on.

660
00:52:57,268 --> 00:52:58,895
- I'll get the car.
- All right.

661
00:52:59,170 --> 00:53:02,401
Oh, a cigar!
All right, that's how it starts.

662
00:53:02,540 --> 00:53:03,973
Police brutality!

663
00:53:04,141 --> 00:53:07,508
- Hey, stop manhandling him!
- Hey, you can't come in here.

664
00:53:08,212 --> 00:53:10,237
Here's another one already lift.

665
00:53:10,381 --> 00:53:12,110
- Oh, nuts, I dropped my cigar.
- What?

666
00:53:12,249 --> 00:53:13,273
- Fire!
- Where?

667
00:53:13,951 --> 00:53:16,317
- Oh, Geez, that's all I need.
- So long, copper!

668
00:53:19,356 --> 00:53:22,120
Desperate ducks
commit desperate acts!

669
00:53:23,427 --> 00:53:25,122
Freeze!

670
00:53:27,031 --> 00:53:28,589
Book him, Ducko!

671
00:53:28,766 --> 00:53:31,166
Give her the keys to the cuffs,
Flatfoot!

672
00:53:32,837 --> 00:53:34,304
Yeah.

673
00:53:35,606 --> 00:53:37,540
What are you doing here
tonight? You got no ID.

674
00:53:37,675 --> 00:53:38,642
- Lieutenant?
- What?

675
00:53:38,776 --> 00:53:39,868
The duck got away.

676
00:53:40,211 --> 00:53:42,042
Shut up, fool!
Get him out of here!

677
00:53:42,179 --> 00:53:45,740
Over here on the double.
Okay. I want this guy.

678
00:53:45,816 --> 00:53:48,649
The suspect is three foot
one inches tall.

679
00:53:48,686 --> 00:53:51,211
- Three-two, thank you.
- You heard me.

680
00:53:51,322 --> 00:53:54,780
He's armed. That means
he's got a weapon, right?

681
00:53:55,493 --> 00:53:59,361
- That also means he's dangerous.
- Me?

682
00:53:59,497 --> 00:54:02,660
Extremely dangerous.

683
00:54:03,200 --> 00:54:04,827
Shoot to kill!

684
00:54:07,238 --> 00:54:09,536
Let's move it out!
Come on!

685
00:54:10,541 --> 00:54:12,338
Richard, come with me.

686
00:54:14,011 --> 00:54:15,069
Okay.

687
00:54:16,247 --> 00:54:17,680
Let's go.

688
00:54:24,388 --> 00:54:25,912
- No, don't shoot.
- We give up!

689
00:54:26,056 --> 00:54:28,024
- Time out!
- We surrender.

690
00:54:30,160 --> 00:54:33,254
- Dr. Jenning?
- What?

691
00:54:35,966 --> 00:54:38,662
- More cops, come on, hurry!
- What?

692
00:54:38,802 --> 00:54:39,826
- Come here.
- Get over here, Doc.

693
00:54:40,004 --> 00:54:42,564
- Howard, Howard...
- What?

694
00:54:45,876 --> 00:54:48,003
The laser spectra-scope
malfunctioned again.

695
00:54:48,178 --> 00:54:51,909
There was a tremendous
explosion and then...

696
00:54:52,049 --> 00:54:55,109
I must have blacked out. Then
suddenly I find myself out here.

697
00:54:59,857 --> 00:55:03,816
- Are they after you?
- Does 'shoot to kill' sound serious?

698
00:55:03,961 --> 00:55:05,292
I'm probably finished, too.

699
00:55:06,530 --> 00:55:08,623
Those experiments
weren't authorized.

700
00:55:08,832 --> 00:55:10,959
They're probably
gonna blame me.

701
00:55:13,270 --> 00:55:15,534
Oh, my God, he needs help.
Howard, maybe...

702
00:55:15,673 --> 00:55:18,437
- we all should get out of here.
- You got a car, Doc?

703
00:55:23,681 --> 00:55:26,673
What's wrong with me?
There's the back gate.

704
00:55:26,917 --> 00:55:30,444
- Good, there's no cops.
- I don't have a gate key.

705
00:55:30,588 --> 00:55:33,079
You've got a foot, don't you?
So step on it.

706
00:55:40,497 --> 00:55:42,226
Lieutenant, a car crashed out
the back gate.

707
00:55:42,399 --> 00:55:43,923
- Headed for Highway Five.
- All right, get out an All Points...

708
00:55:44,068 --> 00:55:45,763
- Bulletin right now.
- Yes, sir!

709
00:55:46,937 --> 00:55:50,532
How in the hell am I gonna explain
a manhunt for a duck?

710
00:55:50,975 --> 00:55:53,944
- It's a duck hunt.
- Hansen, please, don't, don't...

711
00:55:54,078 --> 00:55:55,875
don't start, please? Please?

712
00:55:56,814 --> 00:55:59,783
Can't you understand?
I'm telling you I saw something!

713
00:55:59,917 --> 00:56:01,885
Doc, you're in shock
from the explosion...

714
00:56:02,019 --> 00:56:05,113
- and you're imagining things.
- Watch where you're going, damn it!

715
00:56:13,297 --> 00:56:17,233
Listen, an evil has landed.
The world is in great danger.

716
00:56:17,401 --> 00:56:19,892
Yeah, it certainly is when
you're out on the highway.

717
00:56:20,037 --> 00:56:21,504
Look out!

718
00:56:26,877 --> 00:56:28,344
You're gonna get us killed.

719
00:56:28,479 --> 00:56:32,415
It feels like something inside me
gnawing at my guts!

720
00:56:32,549 --> 00:56:35,416
- What's wrong with me?
- Well, what did you have for lunch?

721
00:56:36,654 --> 00:56:39,418
Oh, boy!
Oh, boy!

722
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:52,867
Come on, give us a break!
Don't close your eyes.

723
00:56:53,003 --> 00:56:53,992
The pain.

724
00:56:54,138 --> 00:56:57,437
It's like I'm transforming inside.
I'm afraid I'm about...

725
00:56:57,574 --> 00:56:59,838
- to become something else.
- Oh, great...

726
00:56:59,977 --> 00:57:02,707
- like a sex change or something.
- Something's growing inside me.

727
00:57:02,846 --> 00:57:05,679
It's replicating and superseding
all my intern organs!

728
00:57:05,916 --> 00:57:07,611
Well, stop at a bathroom, huh?

729
00:57:08,485 --> 00:57:11,386
That monster's shape I saw.

730
00:57:14,658 --> 00:57:17,320
- Jenning!
- It's inside my body.

731
00:57:17,728 --> 00:57:20,424
This guy's delirious.
He's not making any sense.

732
00:57:20,597 --> 00:57:23,031
It's too late.
The end of the world is coming...

733
00:57:23,167 --> 00:57:25,567
and I will be the cause of it.

734
00:57:26,136 --> 00:57:29,902
Jenning, man, slow down!
Steer you big yo-yo! Steer!

735
00:57:36,780 --> 00:57:40,876
Howard, step on the brake!
Howard, step on the brake!

736
00:57:46,757 --> 00:57:49,726
Oh, no!
White line, wrong way.

737
00:58:01,305 --> 00:58:04,604
- The brake! Push, Beverly, push!
- I'm trying!

738
00:58:20,224 --> 00:58:23,625
I'm dead.
Yes, you are.

739
00:58:23,761 --> 00:58:26,662
- You think that's funny, Jenning?
- I'm not Jenning any more.

740
00:58:26,797 --> 00:58:32,565
The transformation is complete.
I am now someone else.

741
00:58:32,703 --> 00:58:34,898
Try telling that to your
insurance company.

742
00:58:35,038 --> 00:58:38,007
I think he needs come coffee.
Come on.

743
00:58:48,886 --> 00:58:50,877
Oh, after you.

744
00:59:03,300 --> 00:59:04,164
Hey, sorry.

745
00:59:04,301 --> 00:59:06,997
This is why
I hate the night' shift.

746
00:59:08,438 --> 00:59:11,464
I'm sorry, we don't allow
pets on the premises.

747
00:59:11,608 --> 00:59:16,545
Hey, have a heart.
Seeing eye duck.

748
00:59:17,481 --> 00:59:19,574
Touching, isn't he?

749
00:59:20,651 --> 00:59:23,381
Not so tight. What are you doing?
Falling in love?

750
00:59:23,520 --> 00:59:25,613
Yeah, sit down.

751
00:59:25,923 --> 00:59:28,016
I need a beer bad.
Gotta find a waitress.

752
00:59:28,158 --> 00:59:29,125
Yeah.

753
00:59:30,327 --> 00:59:34,661
- Hey, honey! You!
- Yeah, I'm coming.

754
00:59:35,732 --> 00:59:37,597
Here she comes.

755
00:59:38,635 --> 00:59:42,833
Your kid's costume is really radical.
I'll bet he's crazy about...

756
00:59:44,241 --> 00:59:47,267
Yeah, I'm very
attached to him.

757
00:59:47,611 --> 00:59:50,239
Your dad's sort
of in his own space.

758
00:59:50,380 --> 00:59:52,041
What do you think
he'd like to eat?

759
00:59:52,149 --> 00:59:55,915
I no longer need
human food.

760
00:59:56,720 --> 00:59:58,745
I know it's a drag, but you're
gonna have to order some food...

761
00:59:58,856 --> 01:00:02,485
if you wanna sit here, so how
about the specials on the menu?

762
01:00:05,329 --> 01:00:09,459
You are about to witness
the end of the old world...

763
01:00:09,600 --> 01:00:12,467
and the birth of the new.

764
01:00:12,603 --> 01:00:16,630
Hey, is he like one of those
TV Evangelists or something?

765
01:00:17,040 --> 01:00:18,530
- Yeah.
- Or something.

766
01:00:18,642 --> 01:00:20,940
- I'm gonna kill somebody.
- It's okay, Howard.

767
01:00:21,078 --> 01:00:23,342
Why don't we just have three
specials and three beers.

768
01:00:23,480 --> 01:00:24,447
Right.

769
01:00:27,150 --> 01:00:30,483
- Poor girl.
- Listen, Dr. J.

770
01:00:32,422 --> 01:00:35,255
If you could tune back
into reality for a second.

771
01:00:35,492 --> 01:00:38,427
I don't understand anything
you're talking about.

772
01:00:38,595 --> 01:00:42,656
All I know is I need that
laser machine to get me home.

773
01:00:42,799 --> 01:00:45,632
Is it still working, Jenning?
Jenning!

774
01:00:45,802 --> 01:00:50,501
I told you, bird brain,
I'm not Jenning any more!

775
01:00:50,674 --> 01:00:55,441
I am now one of the Dark
Over Lords of the Universe.

776
01:00:56,013 --> 01:01:00,313
- Dark Over Lord of the Universe?
- That must be quite a responsibility.

777
01:01:00,417 --> 01:01:04,979
Tonight the laser beam hit
the Nexus of Sominus.

778
01:01:05,155 --> 01:01:07,180
What is that?
A Suburb of Cleveland?

779
01:01:07,858 --> 01:01:12,818
It lied beyond the planets.
It's a region of demons...

780
01:01:13,230 --> 01:01:17,724
to which we Dark Over Lords
were exiled eons ago.

781
01:01:17,868 --> 01:01:21,634
- I hope you're getting all this.
- Howard, what I'm getting is that...

782
01:01:21,705 --> 01:01:24,469
- this man is very, very sick.
- Just as you...

783
01:01:24,608 --> 01:01:26,508
were brought down
here accidentally.

784
01:01:26,710 --> 01:01:31,204
Tonight the laser beam
released me from that...

785
01:01:31,315 --> 01:01:36,252
region of demons and
pulled me down into that lab.

786
01:01:36,720 --> 01:01:40,178
- Small universe.
- During the explosion...

787
01:01:40,290 --> 01:01:45,091
I entered Jenning's body.
So...

788
01:01:48,198 --> 01:01:51,031
I have disguised
my true form...

789
01:01:51,134 --> 01:01:57,004
which would be considered
hideous and revolting here.

790
01:01:58,208 --> 01:02:00,108
Lucky for the people eating.

791
01:02:03,680 --> 01:02:05,011
You ordered the specials,
what's wrong?

792
01:02:05,182 --> 01:02:10,552
This will mean the extinction
of all existing life forms.

793
01:02:10,721 --> 01:02:12,951
- You haven't even tasted it, yet.
- What do you think?

794
01:02:13,123 --> 01:02:14,715
I'm into cannibalism
or something?

795
01:02:14,925 --> 01:02:18,156
Hey, are we like all in
the same discussion here?

796
01:02:18,295 --> 01:02:21,321
I'll give you a hint, Doll.
What's white, ovid...

797
01:02:21,465 --> 01:02:23,456
and always reminds
me of my birthday?

798
01:02:23,734 --> 01:02:26,100
- I don't know.
- The eggs! Get them out of here!

799
01:02:26,937 --> 01:02:32,102
Gosh, you know, hostility
is like psychic boomerang.

800
01:02:32,709 --> 01:02:36,236
I can't believe this planet!
Fried eggs. Yuck!

801
01:02:36,580 --> 01:02:40,812
- Just bring the beer!
- Howard? Howard?

802
01:02:55,232 --> 01:02:57,132
- What happened?
- How the hell did you do that?

803
01:02:57,267 --> 01:02:59,895
- My powers are growing.
- Watch out!

804
01:03:00,037 --> 01:03:02,437
- It is time now.
- What's that?

805
01:03:02,639 --> 01:03:06,200
It is the code key. It will
activate the laser spectra scope...

806
01:03:06,376 --> 01:03:10,745
when I use it tonight to bring
down the other Dark Over Lords.

807
01:03:10,914 --> 01:03:13,212
- The others?
- Now he's got a whole gang.

808
01:03:13,383 --> 01:03:15,874
Well, screw them.
I got dibs on the laser first.

809
01:03:16,019 --> 01:03:18,487
Gimme that code hey.
That's my ticket home!

810
01:03:26,897 --> 01:03:30,196
- Look at his hand!
- It's nothing. Look at his face!

811
01:03:31,802 --> 01:03:35,704
Yes. Soon the Dark Over
Lords will engulf the Earth.

812
01:03:36,039 --> 01:03:41,534
- Nothing human will remain here.
- Nothing ducks will remain either!

813
01:03:41,711 --> 01:03:44,544
- Move, we're going!
- You will get the check?

814
01:03:45,148 --> 01:03:46,911
Hate to eat and run.

815
01:03:47,084 --> 01:03:49,279
- Hello there.
- Get out of the way.

816
01:03:49,386 --> 01:03:51,820
- Hey, look the talking duck.
- Bug off!

817
01:03:51,955 --> 01:03:56,255
- Lord, what is that?
- You jackass, he's a ventriloquist.

818
01:03:56,393 --> 01:03:58,861
These guy here is doing the talking
and this here's the dummy.

819
01:03:58,995 --> 01:04:00,462
Go ahead,
say something, dummy!

820
01:04:00,597 --> 01:04:03,691
You might not wanna hear
what I'll say, Bozo!

821
01:04:04,468 --> 01:04:07,130
Did you make him
say that, Jerk Off?

822
01:04:08,672 --> 01:04:11,664
Leave him alone! He was
just in an industrial accident.

823
01:04:11,808 --> 01:04:13,275
- So take a hike, Cowboy!
- You...

824
01:04:13,610 --> 01:04:15,601
- You're a dead duck!
- Hey!

825
01:04:15,779 --> 01:04:17,679
What's this? The key
to your duck mobile?

826
01:04:17,848 --> 01:04:19,372
Gimme that or
you're gonna be sorry.

827
01:04:19,549 --> 01:04:21,710
Better watch out he's
a master of Quack-foo!

828
01:04:21,885 --> 01:04:23,284
I'll Quack-foo him!

829
01:04:23,954 --> 01:04:25,182
Bullies!

830
01:04:25,789 --> 01:04:28,917
Put me down!
Come on that front.

831
01:04:29,059 --> 01:04:31,994
All nice!
Going up! I'm going.

832
01:04:38,401 --> 01:04:40,596
This one's for you, Cracker!

833
01:04:41,538 --> 01:04:44,632
- Good shot! Good shot!
- Another hungry customer!

834
01:04:45,675 --> 01:04:49,509
- You...
- Toro, toro! Ole!

835
01:04:50,180 --> 01:04:52,512
I'm gonna get you,
you dumb duck!

836
01:04:53,717 --> 01:04:55,275
Hey, boy!

837
01:04:59,890 --> 01:05:02,290
Call the police!
Not the police!

838
01:05:02,425 --> 01:05:04,325
Call somebody else!
They're gonna hurt Howard.

839
01:05:04,494 --> 01:05:09,659
An evil unlike any you can imagine
is about to engulf the Earth.

840
01:05:09,799 --> 01:05:12,393
No, no, we have fights
in here all the time.

841
01:05:12,569 --> 01:05:17,700
- Man, Jenning! Your order is ready.
- Are you gonna just sit there?

842
01:05:18,041 --> 01:05:21,135
- She took my eggs!
- One special!

843
01:05:22,345 --> 01:05:24,313
- Howard!
- Beverly!

844
01:05:25,081 --> 01:05:27,140
- Howard!
- Jenning!

845
01:05:27,284 --> 01:05:31,414
- I could use some help here, Buddy!
- Come on, let's get out of here!

846
01:05:35,091 --> 01:05:36,217
Howard?

847
01:05:37,093 --> 01:05:40,529
You're not getting away now,
you stinking little bird!

848
01:05:40,931 --> 01:05:44,059
Put me down!
Put me down right now!

849
01:05:44,734 --> 01:05:49,535
Put him down! Howard maybe
a duck but you people are animals!

850
01:05:49,873 --> 01:05:56,403
- He's my boyfriend!
- That's disgusting.

851
01:05:57,013 --> 01:05:58,844
You don't make me
proud to be a human!

852
01:05:58,982 --> 01:06:01,075
Let me just pay the
check and I'm out of here.

853
01:06:02,786 --> 01:06:04,014
I can't believe that you're
just sitting here.

854
01:06:04,154 --> 01:06:06,019
Look what they're
doing to Howard!

855
01:06:07,190 --> 01:06:09,624
- Geez!
- Chicken fry!

856
01:06:09,759 --> 01:06:11,727
Where's the SPCA
when you need them?

857
01:06:11,861 --> 01:06:15,627
- I am not immune.
- I'm gonna barbecue your bill, bird.

858
01:06:15,765 --> 01:06:18,131
Great duck in heaven,
this is the end of Howard.

859
01:06:18,235 --> 01:06:20,703
There's gonna be more violence!
I hate violence!

860
01:06:20,804 --> 01:06:22,863
You gotta go in there
and beat them up.

861
01:06:22,973 --> 01:06:26,500
Jenning! Jenning, don't
just sit there! This is serious!

862
01:06:26,643 --> 01:06:29,271
- They're gonna cook me!
- Take that!

863
01:06:31,081 --> 01:06:35,882
- Any last words?
- Yeah, Jenning!

864
01:06:36,686 --> 01:06:40,087
- He's my favorite duck.
- You hardly know him.

865
01:06:40,223 --> 01:06:43,784
Jenning! They're seasoning me!
Wait, you better let me up.

866
01:06:43,927 --> 01:06:47,226
- You don't wanna get my friend angry!
- Yeah? Why?

867
01:06:47,397 --> 01:06:50,298
Because he's one of the
Dark Over Lords of the Universe.

868
01:06:50,467 --> 01:06:53,334
And he can destroy
you and the Earth, everything.

869
01:06:56,172 --> 01:06:58,732
Yeah, well, I didn't
buy it at first either.

870
01:06:58,875 --> 01:07:03,209
Look, they're laughing at you
and they've got Mr. Code Key.

871
01:07:05,415 --> 01:07:07,849
My God!

872
01:07:08,418 --> 01:07:12,184
- One, two...
- Wait a minute! Jenning!

873
01:07:12,756 --> 01:07:16,192
Look! I warned you!
Here he comes!

874
01:07:31,508 --> 01:07:36,207
- He must have ate the chili.
- Release the small water fowl!

875
01:07:38,448 --> 01:07:41,940
- Bring me the Code Key, Howard.
- Right! The Code Key!

876
01:07:42,085 --> 01:07:44,451
You heard him!
Cut me loose!

877
01:07:44,587 --> 01:07:49,183
Sounds like a brunch of
bull puckie to me!

878
01:07:50,560 --> 01:07:51,322
My God!

879
01:08:07,243 --> 01:08:09,177
My God!

880
01:08:17,487 --> 01:08:20,354
- Are you okay, Howard?
- Yes.

881
01:08:20,657 --> 01:08:23,251
- Enough of this crap!
- You out of here!

882
01:08:25,462 --> 01:08:29,262
If you can't take the heat,
get out of that kitchen!

883
01:08:35,672 --> 01:08:40,166
- Where's the Code Key?
- It's closing time!

884
01:08:44,347 --> 01:08:49,182
The Code Key! It's not nice
to fool with the Dark Over Lord.

885
01:09:04,601 --> 01:09:09,163
- They get the point, Jenning!
- Get out of the way!

886
01:09:21,618 --> 01:09:24,519
- Now's our chance.
- Yeah, come on. This way.

887
01:09:26,856 --> 01:09:28,721
Cut it out, Howard.

888
01:09:31,628 --> 01:09:35,860
- Going somewhere?
- Yeah, without you!

889
01:09:48,311 --> 01:09:52,213
- Move the table out of the way!
- I can't, it's stuck!

890
01:09:53,216 --> 01:09:54,979
What's wrong?

891
01:09:57,454 --> 01:09:59,081
Howard, get down from there!

892
01:09:59,989 --> 01:10:03,356
- Like I'm doing this on purpose?
- Give me the Code Key!

893
01:10:03,493 --> 01:10:05,757
Yeah? What if I don't?

894
01:10:07,464 --> 01:10:10,592
Can't you take a joke?
Geez, you broke my head.

895
01:10:22,145 --> 01:10:26,275
I will now bring down
the other Dark Over Lords.

896
01:10:26,416 --> 01:10:28,543
Hey, what about me?

897
01:10:40,096 --> 01:10:42,894
You filthy scum bucket!

898
01:11:04,721 --> 01:11:06,018
Run!

899
01:11:07,624 --> 01:11:09,922
No! Beverly!

900
01:11:15,665 --> 01:11:17,098
Beverly?

901
01:11:24,440 --> 01:11:26,101
Howard, look out!

902
01:11:28,578 --> 01:11:31,775
You killed him!
You killed him!

903
01:11:35,218 --> 01:11:38,813
Beverly, I'll find you!

904
01:11:46,696 --> 01:11:51,030
- I need your body.
- You creep, I've that one before!

905
01:11:51,167 --> 01:11:54,796
The Dark Over Lords cannot
exist on this planet unless...

906
01:11:54,904 --> 01:12:01,639
- they grow inside a human body.
- God, no!

907
01:12:06,849 --> 01:12:10,580
I hurt! Need energy.

908
01:12:13,957 --> 01:12:15,288
Watch out!

909
01:12:18,661 --> 01:12:21,721
More energy!

910
01:12:30,707 --> 01:12:33,232
Geez, that's the grossest!
I'm gonna puke!

911
01:12:51,574 --> 01:12:54,805
There was this big guy and
this girl and this little kid.

912
01:12:54,977 --> 01:12:57,002
At least I thought it
was a little kid.

913
01:12:57,213 --> 01:13:01,411
Then I flashed on reality right!
Halloween's not till next month.

914
01:13:01,584 --> 01:13:04,451
I know my rights.
Where's my baseball cap?

915
01:13:04,553 --> 01:13:06,453
- Shut up!
- Bastards!

916
01:13:10,326 --> 01:13:12,157
Can't move!

917
01:13:13,796 --> 01:13:15,923
Philsey?

918
01:13:16,599 --> 01:13:19,033
Philsey?

919
01:13:22,638 --> 01:13:26,005
Philsey! It's me.

920
01:13:28,477 --> 01:13:30,604
Howard.

921
01:13:39,255 --> 01:13:42,747
Howard, I got arrested at the plant.
I'm gonna have a criminal record.

922
01:13:43,426 --> 01:13:45,121
Jenning kidnapped Beverly.

923
01:13:45,294 --> 01:13:47,262
He's taking her back
to that science lab.

924
01:13:47,396 --> 01:13:50,331
- What? Why?
- He's some kind of monster.

925
01:13:50,466 --> 01:13:53,697
He's gonna bring down more of
his buddies. He's got big plans.

926
01:13:53,836 --> 01:13:57,431
Like taking over Earth.
Philsey, we gotta get out of here.

927
01:13:57,573 --> 01:14:00,667
Howard, this door doesn't
have any handles...

928
01:14:00,810 --> 01:14:02,903
get a rock or something
and break this window.

929
01:14:03,045 --> 01:14:04,979
- A rock?
- Window.

930
01:14:06,682 --> 01:14:08,479
Let me try the door first.

931
01:14:12,388 --> 01:14:14,720
- How we getting out of here?
- Come on.

932
01:14:15,825 --> 01:14:17,793
Philsey, where we going?

933
01:14:22,331 --> 01:14:24,128
Hey, over here.

934
01:14:26,135 --> 01:14:30,333
- They're gonna be gone soon.
- Hey, let's steal a cop car.

935
01:14:30,473 --> 01:14:32,532
Don't you think that would
be a little conspicuous?

936
01:14:32,675 --> 01:14:35,542
- Hitchhike? Cab?
- What is that?

937
01:14:39,048 --> 01:14:40,913
Gezz! It looks like an airplane.

938
01:14:41,050 --> 01:14:43,314
Well, it will be. We can
put it together in no time.

939
01:14:43,452 --> 01:14:46,387
Somebody's weekend hobby's
gonna get back to that lab.

940
01:14:46,589 --> 01:14:48,750
Hey, we've got a saying
on my planet.

941
01:14:49,024 --> 01:14:52,460
If God intended us to fly he
wouldn't have taken away our wings.

942
01:14:52,595 --> 01:14:55,063
That's really profound, Howard.
Could you find the tool box?

943
01:14:55,297 --> 01:14:57,629
Yeah, I know why
you want a tool box.

944
01:14:57,767 --> 01:14:59,394
You got a screw loose.

945
01:15:16,619 --> 01:15:20,715
- Power.
- No.

946
01:15:39,575 --> 01:15:41,099
They just spotted
the duck and the kid.

947
01:15:41,243 --> 01:15:42,938
- Where?
- Behind the warehouse next door.

948
01:15:43,078 --> 01:15:46,275
- They're about to take off.
- What do you mean "take off"?

949
01:15:47,082 --> 01:15:49,107
- It's not doing anything.
- Cops!

950
01:15:50,352 --> 01:15:52,980
- Push forward on the throttle.
- Okay, yeah.

951
01:15:53,122 --> 01:15:55,022
Full throttle!
Full throttle!

952
01:15:56,058 --> 01:15:58,288
- Cops, Philsey!
- One eighty, Howard.

953
01:15:58,427 --> 01:15:59,189
Right.

954
01:16:02,398 --> 01:16:04,093
One away!

955
01:16:05,801 --> 01:16:07,894
Come on! Hurry up!

956
01:16:08,671 --> 01:16:12,664
- There's cops everywhere.
- Not in the air, Howard! Up, up!

957
01:16:13,676 --> 01:16:15,371
Look out!

958
01:16:17,413 --> 01:16:19,938
Prepare for a take-off.

959
01:16:28,324 --> 01:16:30,485
No, no!

960
01:16:36,632 --> 01:16:39,533
Follow them! Bring them
down and bring them back!

961
01:16:41,837 --> 01:16:45,864
I want that duck!
Dead or alive!

962
01:16:46,041 --> 01:16:48,669
- South, Southwest, Howard.
- What?

963
01:16:49,879 --> 01:16:52,404
That way. Stay low!

964
01:16:52,548 --> 01:16:56,382
Beverly, I'm coming
to get you, sweetheart.

965
01:17:20,609 --> 01:17:25,308
Help me! Help! Somebody help me!
Please, help me!

966
01:17:25,481 --> 01:17:26,470
Please watch your step.

967
01:17:26,649 --> 01:17:27,980
I think you're all gonna
find this very interesting.

968
01:17:28,117 --> 01:17:30,176
You know, honestly, Congressman
this Three Mile Islands China...

969
01:17:30,319 --> 01:17:32,651
Syndrome melt down stuff.
It's all history.

970
01:17:32,788 --> 01:17:33,777
The only melt downs
around here...

971
01:17:33,923 --> 01:17:36,016
are the cheese sandwiches
in the toaster oven.

972
01:17:41,764 --> 01:17:45,291
These Washington guys take
a real beating on these junkets.

973
01:17:45,467 --> 01:17:51,667
Our nuclear reactor is pumping
out one million kilowatts of power.

974
01:17:51,807 --> 01:17:58,679
One million kilowatts of power?

975
01:17:58,847 --> 01:18:03,045
Yes, sir. Listen, I think
we could all use cup of coffee.

976
01:18:03,452 --> 01:18:07,252
Help! Somebody help me,
please! Help!

977
01:18:48,931 --> 01:18:52,025
Come on! Go, go, go, go!

978
01:19:04,346 --> 01:19:07,247
I feel much better.

979
01:19:12,588 --> 01:19:15,716
What's that? Right pedal!
Right pedal!

980
01:19:18,260 --> 01:19:20,922
- Damn it, that was too close!
- I'm just learning here!

981
01:19:21,063 --> 01:19:23,088
Howard, in pre-historic
times you flew.

982
01:19:23,198 --> 01:19:28,431
Fly, Howard! Find your instincts.
Trust your birdness. Fly!

983
01:19:44,620 --> 01:19:46,952
Howard, pull up! Pull up!

984
01:19:51,794 --> 01:19:53,819
- Touch down!
- Great landing, Howard...

985
01:19:53,962 --> 01:19:55,930
but this isn't gonna
get us to the lab.

986
01:19:56,098 --> 01:20:00,034
You said to follow my instincts.
This is my nesting instinct.

987
01:20:04,339 --> 01:20:08,241
- I'm flying, blind here.
- Shut up! You're not flying at all!

988
01:20:08,377 --> 01:20:11,005
- Let her rip!
- Bombs away!

989
01:20:16,251 --> 01:20:18,685
Pull it up, Howard,
were running outta land!

990
01:20:18,787 --> 01:20:21,221
- Wet stuff ahead!
- Watch out!

991
01:20:48,150 --> 01:20:51,051
Death from the skies
to all duck, Hunters!

992
01:20:52,421 --> 01:20:54,048
Toro, toro, toro!

993
01:20:55,023 --> 01:20:57,082
Vengeance is mine! Yeah!

994
01:20:59,461 --> 01:21:00,860
Bonzai!

995
01:21:16,078 --> 01:21:18,444
Slow down.
Slow down.

996
01:21:18,714 --> 01:21:20,841
Hey, you, pull over here!

997
01:21:31,994 --> 01:21:34,258
This is a smog
device inspection.

998
01:21:36,498 --> 01:21:39,695
- And I need... Shut off the engine!
- It is off! Somebody's pushing!

999
01:21:45,073 --> 01:21:49,169
Shut it down! Shut it down!
What the hell is wrong with you?

1000
01:21:49,912 --> 01:21:57,318
- I wanna see your license, Jack!
- I have no license, I am not Jack.

1001
01:22:37,192 --> 01:22:40,821
Smog inspection!

1002
01:22:49,471 --> 01:22:51,371
What happened?

1003
01:22:53,809 --> 01:22:55,800
We gotta get outta here!

1004
01:23:00,315 --> 01:23:04,547
- Damage report, Philsey?
- Fuel hose is busted!

1005
01:23:04,853 --> 01:23:09,449
Rudder is wasted. Basically,
we're dying here, Howard.

1006
01:23:12,127 --> 01:23:14,220
- I'm bailing out!
- No, you're not!

1007
01:23:14,363 --> 01:23:17,764
You're gonna get up there
and fix this lawn mower now!

1008
01:23:27,309 --> 01:23:29,971
- Philsey, how's it going?
- I'm getting close.

1009
01:23:30,112 --> 01:23:31,977
- I'm on top of it!
- Good.

1010
01:23:36,551 --> 01:23:39,418
Relax, Howard, I almost got it!

1011
01:23:53,468 --> 01:23:58,337
Philsey, I did a loop the loop.
I'm getting good at this! I...

1012
01:24:00,475 --> 01:24:02,636
Howard!

1013
01:24:03,111 --> 01:24:04,772
Stop, Howard!

1014
01:24:06,882 --> 01:24:09,510
Geez, I thought I lost you.

1015
01:24:10,919 --> 01:24:13,854
Philsey, this is no time
for water sports.

1016
01:24:14,423 --> 01:24:16,391
I'm just kidding, big guy.

1017
01:24:30,138 --> 01:24:31,867
Hey, scum, lemme go!

1018
01:24:43,251 --> 01:24:48,154
- Philsey, get back up here!
- I'm trying!

1019
01:24:48,323 --> 01:24:51,156
No, no, don't shoot!
I'm an innocent hostage!

1020
01:24:51,326 --> 01:24:53,590
- The duck's a lunatic!
- What?

1021
01:24:53,762 --> 01:24:57,459
He's a duck terrorist!
He hijacked the plane!

1022
01:25:00,802 --> 01:25:02,463
Howard, pull it back!

1023
01:25:09,945 --> 01:25:13,676
- Welcome back, Philsey!
- Thanks, it's great to be back.

1024
01:25:16,551 --> 01:25:18,485
Will you watch
the road, damn it?

1025
01:25:18,620 --> 01:25:21,180
Hey, it's just another car.
It's no big deal!

1026
01:25:21,723 --> 01:25:24,214
- Yes, big deal! Big...
- What?

1027
01:25:24,359 --> 01:25:26,827
Big, big, big...

1028
01:25:32,768 --> 01:25:35,464
- No wings.
- Welcome to the club.

1029
01:25:35,904 --> 01:25:37,462
Coming through!

1030
01:25:44,012 --> 01:25:46,276
That's a lotta fun.
I'd like to get off now.

1031
01:25:46,915 --> 01:25:51,318
Slow down.
Slow down!

1032
01:25:51,486 --> 01:25:54,353
Relax, I'll just throttle
this baby back.

1033
01:25:56,725 --> 01:25:59,159
- Philsey! I better tell you now.
- What?

1034
01:25:59,294 --> 01:26:00,921
I can't swim!

1035
01:26:08,236 --> 01:26:11,603
Philsey, help!
Philsey, help me!

1036
01:26:12,374 --> 01:26:14,569
Never heard of a duck
that couldn't swim.

1037
01:26:14,709 --> 01:26:18,475
- Shut up and save me!
- We've been through hell!

1038
01:26:18,580 --> 01:26:22,914
Now, I there is some kind of monster
in here. Howard this crazy!

1039
01:26:23,051 --> 01:26:28,512
Phil, no duck is an island and
if fate sent me here to save her.

1040
01:26:28,690 --> 01:26:31,659
Then, I wonder that duck
is ready to fight.

1041
01:26:34,396 --> 01:26:36,125
Damn!

1042
01:26:46,341 --> 01:26:48,434
He's starting
the spectra-scope.

1043
01:26:48,543 --> 01:26:51,842
Gezz, he's gonna bring down
another Dark Over Lord.

1044
01:26:51,980 --> 01:26:55,279
- We gotta get Beverly outta there.
- Hey, take it easy, Conan.

1045
01:26:55,383 --> 01:26:58,875
What are you gonna fight him with?
We gotta find some kind of... Wait!

1046
01:26:59,054 --> 01:27:02,785
Carter showed me something here once
that might do it, if we can find it!

1047
01:27:04,125 --> 01:27:05,922
You'll never get away with this!

1048
01:27:08,029 --> 01:27:11,192
We'll find it! Come on, Philsey!

1049
01:27:12,534 --> 01:27:14,559
You don't scare me!

1050
01:27:22,744 --> 01:27:27,681
Boy, the Defense Research. This
is it! This is it! This is locked!

1051
01:27:37,959 --> 01:27:41,451
Okay, I know where it is.
It's on the right or the left or...

1052
01:27:42,597 --> 01:27:46,055
There it is.
The Neutron Disintegrator.

1053
01:27:49,170 --> 01:27:52,799
- And a big lock.
- Rats!

1054
01:27:54,142 --> 01:27:58,670
Okay, all right. Turn me
into a Dark Over Lord...

1055
01:27:58,880 --> 01:28:01,405
I'll still spit in
your wormy face!

1056
01:28:05,587 --> 01:28:09,887
Welcome to Dyna-Technics.
Authorized personnel only.

1058
01:28:16,264 --> 01:28:21,099
Hello, Dr. Jenning. Please select
your target an enter target course.

1059
01:28:23,138 --> 01:28:28,405
Thank you. Laser Spectra-scope is
now targeting the Nexus of Sominus.

1060
01:28:28,610 --> 01:28:30,407
Targeting is in process.

1061
01:28:39,554 --> 01:28:43,615
Come on, Philsey!
Hit it harder! Way to go!

1062
01:28:45,060 --> 01:28:47,358
- Hurry up!
- The Neutron Disintegrator...

1063
01:28:47,462 --> 01:28:49,930
was developed for the Army
until he cost overance became...

1064
01:28:50,031 --> 01:28:51,862
- really embarrassing to the...
- Can it stop Jenning?

1065
01:28:52,000 --> 01:28:54,525
Theoretically, yes, unfortunately
it's never been tested.

1066
01:28:58,573 --> 01:29:02,441
Attention, all personnel,
please, leave the station...

1067
01:29:02,544 --> 01:29:04,876
while laser doors are opening.

1068
01:29:06,881 --> 01:29:10,180
Please, leave machine
while spectra-scope extension.

1069
01:29:13,989 --> 01:29:18,358
Target is now locked.
Target is now locked.

1070
01:29:21,863 --> 01:29:24,229
Is this like a stick-shift
or automatic?

1071
01:29:24,399 --> 01:29:28,199
Well, Howard, you have to get into
firing range without him seeing you!

1072
01:29:28,370 --> 01:29:32,238
Right. I'll sneak up on him
and then I'll blast him!

1073
01:29:32,374 --> 01:29:35,036
Do you wish to bring
the laser to full power?

1074
01:29:35,176 --> 01:29:36,700
Dr. Jenning, I repeat...

1075
01:29:36,911 --> 01:29:39,937
do you wish to bring
the laser to full power?

1076
01:29:41,016 --> 01:29:42,347
Thank you.

1077
01:29:44,452 --> 01:29:47,580
- What's this do?
- No, Howard, don't...

1078
01:29:50,992 --> 01:29:52,459
Howard!

1079
01:29:55,864 --> 01:30:00,062
- You're in big trouble now!
- Shut up!

1080
01:30:13,982 --> 01:30:17,509
Run, Howard!
He's in a bad mood!

1081
01:30:20,755 --> 01:30:23,918
Come on, Philsey, move!
Let's crank her up!

1082
01:30:26,194 --> 01:30:27,593
- Hurry!
- Where's that button?

1083
01:30:27,896 --> 01:30:29,557
It won't start!

1084
01:30:31,499 --> 01:30:32,466
Oh, my God!

1085
01:30:35,303 --> 01:30:37,999
- Watch out!
- Jump, Howard!

1086
01:30:38,106 --> 01:30:39,801
- This is our only chance!
- Get outta there.

1087
01:30:39,941 --> 01:30:42,535
- Duck!
- And proud of it!

1088
01:31:14,175 --> 01:31:18,578
Philsey, you saved my life!
Are you all right?

1089
01:31:18,947 --> 01:31:22,348
- Terrific, Howard.
- It still won't start!

1090
01:31:22,517 --> 01:31:25,645
- Try the seat belt, Howard.
- Seat belt?

1091
01:31:30,725 --> 01:31:32,420
Whatsabe misua.

1092
01:31:34,596 --> 01:31:38,225
You little pond hopper.

1093
01:31:50,478 --> 01:31:53,106
Go, Howard, go!

1094
01:32:01,456 --> 01:32:03,856
Talk about bad breath!

1095
01:32:07,462 --> 01:32:09,657
Turn off the eyes!

1096
01:32:29,651 --> 01:32:32,176
Now it's my turn.

1097
01:32:51,005 --> 01:32:54,270
Dark Over Lord, I want you!

1098
01:33:04,485 --> 01:33:07,215
Prepare to eat beak!

1099
01:33:22,203 --> 01:33:23,898
So long sucker!

1100
01:33:28,109 --> 01:33:29,872
Howard!

1101
01:33:44,592 --> 01:33:45,991
No!

1102
01:33:51,266 --> 01:33:52,756
Howard?

1103
01:33:57,906 --> 01:33:59,373
Howard?

1104
01:34:04,445 --> 01:34:07,346
- Oh, boy!
- Howard?

1105
01:34:14,155 --> 01:34:17,591
- Howard!
- You all right?

1106
01:34:17,992 --> 01:34:20,756
I need this like
I need another tail!

1107
01:34:20,862 --> 01:34:23,626
- You did it!
- Get me down from here!

1108
01:34:23,731 --> 01:34:24,993
Come on!

1109
01:34:30,772 --> 01:34:33,900
- Dr. Jenning?
- Howard, it's not...

1110
01:34:34,075 --> 01:34:34,905
It's not what?

1111
01:34:35,043 --> 01:34:36,442
The devil's not
inside me any more.

1112
01:34:36,611 --> 01:34:38,670
The explosion must have
released it and it's loose!

1113
01:34:38,846 --> 01:34:41,508
- What about me?
- The Dark Over Lord is still here.

1114
01:34:41,649 --> 01:34:45,745
Well then, I suggest we get Beverly
and get the hell outta here!

1115
01:34:47,922 --> 01:34:49,947
Philsey, get her
down from there!

1116
01:34:51,960 --> 01:34:54,554
- What took you so long?
- Nothing. Just got arrested...

1117
01:34:54,762 --> 01:34:58,289
shot at, handcuffed,
I got thrown out of an airplane!

1118
01:34:59,934 --> 01:35:01,265
Guys?

1119
01:35:01,436 --> 01:35:03,461
His tongue with
a cigarette lighter!

1120
01:35:03,571 --> 01:35:05,266
Cigarette lighter?
That's really disgusting!

1121
01:35:05,373 --> 01:35:07,068
- Guys?
- What?

1122
01:35:28,730 --> 01:35:30,527
Oh, my God!

1123
01:35:45,413 --> 01:35:47,176
Phil, Phil.
Get up! Get up!

1124
01:35:47,315 --> 01:35:49,408
- It's coming!
- It's coming! I was just resting.

1125
01:35:49,550 --> 01:35:50,744
Look!

1126
01:36:14,275 --> 01:36:16,971
Good boy, stay back! Stay back.
Oh, boy!

1127
01:36:19,113 --> 01:36:21,547
Howard!

1128
01:36:21,716 --> 01:36:23,809
There goes Howard!
We've gotta help Howard, Phill!

1129
01:36:23,885 --> 01:36:26,217
What?
Yeah, gotta help Howard!

1130
01:36:27,155 --> 01:36:28,952
- Come on. Howard!
- Here we go!

1131
01:36:35,096 --> 01:36:41,626
- Going somewhere, Howard?
- No!

1132
01:36:43,438 --> 01:36:50,606
- There's no escape.
- Philsey! Dr. Jenning! Mother!

1133
01:37:00,221 --> 01:37:03,281
- Do you wish to active the laser?
- Yes.

1134
01:37:03,424 --> 01:37:04,755
Thank you, Dr. Jenning.

1135
01:37:04,926 --> 01:37:07,895
- He started the activation sequence.
- He's gonna bring down more of them.

1136
01:37:08,763 --> 01:37:10,856
You may fire when ready.

1137
01:37:15,736 --> 01:37:18,637
Four minutes to arrival.

1138
01:37:29,450 --> 01:37:33,648
Philsey, Beverly, anybody!
Help!

1139
01:37:33,788 --> 01:37:35,756
Three minutes, thirty seconds
to arrival.

1140
01:37:35,923 --> 01:37:37,686
Howard!
Here!

1141
01:37:39,293 --> 01:37:42,660
All right!
Like salami!

1142
01:37:49,237 --> 01:37:50,966
Did you lose something?

1143
01:37:53,641 --> 01:37:57,975
Alien specimens are arriving
laboratory in three minutes.

1144
01:38:06,087 --> 01:38:07,418
All right!

1145
01:38:31,212 --> 01:38:34,545
Eat claw, Duck!

1146
01:38:34,916 --> 01:38:41,082
- Two minutes to arrival.
- Belt, box, trigger!

1147
01:38:53,534 --> 01:38:56,025
One minute,
thirty seconds to arrival.

1148
01:38:56,170 --> 01:38:59,901
You little duck!

1149
01:39:23,397 --> 01:39:27,390
- One minute to arrival.
- Howard!

1150
01:39:30,104 --> 01:39:32,095
There's more coming down.

1151
01:39:35,810 --> 01:39:37,778
The machine, Howard.
You've got to destroy it!

1152
01:39:37,912 --> 01:39:40,005
- Blast it.
- Get them!

1153
01:39:40,181 --> 01:39:44,015
No, Howard, don't!
You'll never get home.

1154
01:39:44,151 --> 01:39:48,110
- Thirty seconds to arrival.
- Get them!

1155
01:39:55,696 --> 01:40:00,190
Goodbye, Duck World.
Get outta there. Run!

1156
01:40:00,534 --> 01:40:03,094
Ten seconds
and counting to arrival.

1157
01:40:03,204 --> 01:40:03,863
Over here!

1158
01:40:04,005 --> 01:40:12,140
Ten, nine, eight, seven,
six, five, four, three, two...

1159
01:40:12,313 --> 01:40:14,440
one, arrival.

1160
01:40:50,484 --> 01:40:51,712
Howard!

1161
01:41:04,699 --> 01:41:06,223
No!

1162
01:41:13,541 --> 01:41:20,344
I don't know where you are now,
but I hope you're happier there.

1163
01:41:24,885 --> 01:41:32,291
This world didn't threat you very
good, but you saved it, didn't you?

1164
01:41:39,800 --> 01:41:49,573
- Howard?
- I am not Howard anymore.

1165
01:41:56,617 --> 01:42:01,748
Geez, all this smoke,
it's murder on the sinuses.

1166
01:42:05,192 --> 01:42:07,217
Fooled you, didn't I?

1167
01:42:09,163 --> 01:42:13,497
- Howard.
- It's all right, Toots.

1168
01:42:25,513 --> 01:42:30,177
Well, all right, I'd like to dedicate
this song to our new manager.

1169
01:42:36,323 --> 01:42:37,153
Go!

1170
01:43:11,759 --> 01:43:14,557
All right, that's mechanical.
We're gonna release the big wave-0.

1171
01:43:14,695 --> 01:43:17,596
Cue as ready.
Cue and go!

1172
01:43:20,901 --> 01:43:22,027
- Howard, Howard.
- Yeah?

1173
01:43:22,169 --> 01:43:23,830
Help me out!
Release that rope there!

1174
01:43:23,938 --> 01:43:24,962
Gotcha.

1175
01:43:27,808 --> 01:43:31,676
- Not that one!
- Philsey, what's going on?

1176
01:43:31,812 --> 01:43:34,645
Get me down from here!
I've done enough flying.

1177
01:43:34,815 --> 01:43:35,713
Philsey!

1178
01:43:41,755 --> 01:43:48,092
Philsey, do you realize I could
have been killed up there?

1179
01:43:52,366 --> 01:43:54,960
- What's this?
- Rock and Roll!

1180
01:43:55,269 --> 01:43:58,238
Right!
Give me four.

1181
01:44:05,613 --> 01:44:07,740
Big, big, baby.

1182
01:44:09,984 --> 01:44:11,815
Is that hot enough for you?

1183
01:44:32,606 --> 01:44:34,972
Hit a purple "A" for you all.

1184
01:44:55,930 --> 01:44:56,862
Do it!

1185
01:45:08,208 --> 01:45:09,971
That's me!

1186
01:45:22,089 --> 01:45:25,217
Thank you! Thank you!
We love you.

1187
01:45:25,626 --> 01:45:29,528
Howard, Howard,
Howard, Howard!

1188
01:45:29,997 --> 01:45:32,329
We love you!

1189
01:45:36,303 --> 01:45:38,635
Not bad for a duck
from outer space.

1190
01:45:38,772 --> 01:45:40,797
You were great, Ducky.

1191
