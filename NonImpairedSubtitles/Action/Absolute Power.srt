1
00:01:33,132 --> 00:01:34,645
Don't give up.

2
00:01:36,652 --> 00:01:38,244
Oh, I never do.

3
00:01:42,932 --> 00:01:44,126
May I?

4
00:01:55,212 --> 00:01:57,089
You work with your hands?

5
00:02:10,252 --> 00:02:12,243
- Redhead.
- Luther.

6
00:02:21,492 --> 00:02:25,883
Your life would be a whole lot simpler
if you could learn to operate a VCR.

7
00:02:26,132 --> 00:02:29,442
True. Truer words were never spoken.

8
00:12:22,052 --> 00:12:23,451
What's that?

9
00:12:26,012 --> 00:12:28,480
Here we go.

10
00:12:35,292 --> 00:12:37,089
That is nice.

11
00:12:49,532 --> 00:12:52,046
It's okay. He's not here.

12
00:12:52,452 --> 00:12:55,649
Anyway, I told him that I was sick.

13
00:12:56,652 --> 00:12:58,210
So you can relax.

14
00:13:21,852 --> 00:13:23,649
I'll be right back.

15
00:15:55,252 --> 00:15:56,685
You like that? Do you?

16
00:15:57,372 --> 00:15:58,725
Oh, yeah.

17
00:17:01,772 --> 00:17:03,251
So you wanna play, huh?

18
00:17:13,532 --> 00:17:15,284
You okay?

19
00:17:20,292 --> 00:17:21,850
How would you like that?

20
00:17:23,132 --> 00:17:24,485
- You slap...
- Don't slap me!

21
00:17:24,732 --> 00:17:25,801
You little bitch!

22
00:17:26,052 --> 00:17:27,644
Alan, what are you doing?

23
00:17:27,892 --> 00:17:28,881
Alan!

24
00:17:33,732 --> 00:17:35,211
Alan, you're hurting me!

25
00:17:35,412 --> 00:17:37,562
I'll hurt you, goddamn it.

26
00:17:42,772 --> 00:17:43,966
You're hurting me!

27
00:17:44,172 --> 00:17:45,161
Goddamn you!

28
00:17:45,492 --> 00:17:46,527
You wanna be hurt?

29
00:17:46,732 --> 00:17:47,767
I'll hurt you.

30
00:17:50,892 --> 00:17:52,007
You like this?

31
00:17:52,212 --> 00:17:53,406
- Let go!
- Do you?

32
00:17:53,612 --> 00:17:54,601
You like that?

33
00:17:56,332 --> 00:17:58,050
Goddamn you!

34
00:18:01,412 --> 00:18:03,243
- Son of a bitch!
- Get away!

35
00:18:03,492 --> 00:18:05,050
Get back here.

36
00:18:06,012 --> 00:18:07,445
Get back here!

37
00:18:08,412 --> 00:18:09,401
Stop it!

38
00:18:10,132 --> 00:18:12,088
Stop it! Alan!

39
00:18:12,332 --> 00:18:14,050
What are you doing?

40
00:18:26,332 --> 00:18:27,208
Bitch...

41
00:18:27,532 --> 00:18:29,250
...you wanna play?
I'll show you how.

42
00:18:29,492 --> 00:18:30,971
You fucking bastard!

43
00:18:33,012 --> 00:18:34,240
You bastard!

44
00:18:38,332 --> 00:18:40,050
You like that?

45
00:18:43,212 --> 00:18:44,486
- Come back.
- Don't!

46
00:18:44,732 --> 00:18:45,528
Let go of me!

47
00:19:19,132 --> 00:19:21,168
Bitch, you cut me, goddamn it!

48
00:19:21,372 --> 00:19:22,851
Fucking asshole!

49
00:19:23,092 --> 00:19:24,445
I'm gonna kill you!

50
00:19:26,852 --> 00:19:28,080
Help! Help!

51
00:19:37,732 --> 00:19:39,290
Help!

52
00:19:59,292 --> 00:20:00,566
Did you kill her?

53
00:20:02,092 --> 00:20:03,923
No choice in the matter, sir.

54
00:20:05,892 --> 00:20:07,848
What am I gonna do?

55
00:20:10,532 --> 00:20:14,525
- Jesus, Tim. What do we do?
- No choice in the matter.

56
00:20:20,652 --> 00:20:22,165
What the hell was that?

57
00:20:24,612 --> 00:20:26,443
Oh, shit.

58
00:20:28,532 --> 00:20:29,487
Oh, my God.

59
00:20:34,692 --> 00:20:36,444
Oh, my God.

60
00:20:44,692 --> 00:20:47,252
Do you realize
what a shitstorm we're in?

61
00:20:51,532 --> 00:20:53,090
Go on, tell me.

62
00:20:53,292 --> 00:20:56,045
Nothing to tell.
He screamed for help.

63
00:20:56,932 --> 00:20:59,651
You heard no sounds
of violence till then?

64
00:20:59,932 --> 00:21:01,684
Nothing we haven't heard before.

65
00:21:10,052 --> 00:21:12,964
- Maybe I should call the police.
- Oh, Jesus. What?

66
00:21:14,932 --> 00:21:16,047
Bill...

67
00:21:16,532 --> 00:21:18,648
...why don't you think about that.

68
00:21:18,852 --> 00:21:20,444
Just take a second...

69
00:21:20,932 --> 00:21:22,604
...and think about that.

70
00:21:25,612 --> 00:21:27,250
Think real...

71
00:21:27,492 --> 00:21:28,686
...fucking...

72
00:21:29,012 --> 00:21:30,127
...hard.

73
00:21:36,132 --> 00:21:37,850
Probably not a good idea.

74
00:21:56,132 --> 00:21:57,850
Here's what happened.

75
00:21:59,532 --> 00:22:01,090
Poor Christy...

76
00:22:01,292 --> 00:22:04,841
...came home alone
and interrupted a burglary.

77
00:22:05,092 --> 00:22:06,445
Sound logical?

78
00:22:06,652 --> 00:22:07,880
Yeah, sure.

79
00:22:13,252 --> 00:22:15,083
We have to sanitize this place.

80
00:22:17,452 --> 00:22:18,282
Alan.

81
00:22:18,532 --> 00:22:20,443
Did you have sex with her?

82
00:22:20,892 --> 00:22:22,848
I don't know.

83
00:22:23,692 --> 00:22:26,286
Bill, you're gonna have
to examine her.

84
00:22:26,532 --> 00:22:29,251
- I'm no gynecologist.
- I just made you one.

85
00:22:30,052 --> 00:22:30,848
Christ!

86
00:23:05,252 --> 00:23:06,082
I'll take that.

87
00:23:06,332 --> 00:23:08,641
- It has both fingerprints.
- Thanks for sharing.

88
00:23:10,212 --> 00:23:11,361
Gloria.

89
00:23:13,332 --> 00:23:14,651
Gloria.

90
00:23:15,932 --> 00:23:19,049
- Did I kill her?
- Everything's gonna be fine, Alan.

91
00:23:19,252 --> 00:23:20,731
Don't worry about it.

92
00:23:21,132 --> 00:23:23,487
- Oh, God.
- Now be careful.

93
00:23:23,692 --> 00:23:25,648
Just don't get blood on you.

94
00:23:28,092 --> 00:23:31,562
I'll take care of everything, okay?
Just like I always do.

95
00:23:45,412 --> 00:23:47,243
- Oh, shit.
- What?

96
00:23:49,092 --> 00:23:50,844
Madame's purse.

97
00:24:06,812 --> 00:24:09,963
- Miss Russell, let me get him.
- Thank you.

98
00:24:24,092 --> 00:24:25,650
- I got him.
- All right.

99
00:24:26,732 --> 00:24:28,245
Nice and easy, sir.

100
00:25:40,292 --> 00:25:41,850
Oh, my God!

101
00:25:46,732 --> 00:25:47,562
No knife!

102
00:25:47,772 --> 00:25:49,125
- What?
- Where's the knife?

103
00:25:51,492 --> 00:25:52,368
In the bedroom.

104
00:25:52,732 --> 00:25:54,643
- Come on.
- Get up there!

105
00:27:16,092 --> 00:27:16,888
Shit!

106
00:27:17,092 --> 00:27:18,445
Shit!

107
00:27:44,212 --> 00:27:45,247
Go!

108
00:27:50,212 --> 00:27:51,850
Excuse me.

109
00:30:02,332 --> 00:30:03,845
I got the number.

110
00:30:09,012 --> 00:30:11,731
Gee, guys, maybe it was the bogeyman.

111
00:30:12,572 --> 00:30:15,689
Check under the bed.
You may have buried us!

112
00:30:15,892 --> 00:30:17,325
I got his license number.

113
00:30:17,572 --> 00:30:20,132
You think he'll sit around
waiting for us?

114
00:30:20,372 --> 00:30:21,566
Look, take it easy.

115
00:30:21,812 --> 00:30:24,326
Everybody, shut up, all right?

116
00:30:32,012 --> 00:30:33,525
What have you got?

117
00:30:34,772 --> 00:30:36,330
Oh, boy.

118
00:30:56,092 --> 00:30:57,923
Two-way mirror.

119
00:30:58,612 --> 00:31:01,126
We better get cracking
on that license number.

120
00:31:01,812 --> 00:31:03,530
That's all we've got.

121
00:31:03,772 --> 00:31:05,728
He's got the letter opener.

122
00:31:06,092 --> 00:31:07,320
Blood...

123
00:31:07,572 --> 00:31:09,130
...fingerprints.

124
00:31:10,572 --> 00:31:11,766
Jesus!

125
00:31:11,972 --> 00:31:13,724
Think what he can do.

126
00:31:14,012 --> 00:31:17,721
The man's a thief.
A thief who witnessed a murder.

127
00:31:18,412 --> 00:31:20,926
It looks like he stole
a whole bunch of money.

128
00:31:23,172 --> 00:31:25,322
I'll tell you what he's gonna do.

129
00:31:26,012 --> 00:31:28,128
He's gonna run like hell.

130
00:31:40,132 --> 00:31:42,327
They beat us by seven.

131
00:31:42,772 --> 00:31:44,125
By seven?

132
00:31:46,012 --> 00:31:47,525
Who'd have thought that?

133
00:32:33,572 --> 00:32:34,925
Kate.

134
00:32:35,212 --> 00:32:36,327
Kate.

135
00:32:51,892 --> 00:32:54,042
I guess it'd be a little late for me.

136
00:32:54,932 --> 00:32:56,524
The jogging, I mean.

137
00:33:00,692 --> 00:33:02,489
Kind of dumb way to start.

138
00:33:02,932 --> 00:33:05,765
But I did want to talk to you.

139
00:33:06,092 --> 00:33:07,207
About?

140
00:33:09,532 --> 00:33:10,931
The weather, actually.

141
00:33:11,172 --> 00:33:13,128
It's getting cool in the evenings.

142
00:33:13,812 --> 00:33:16,167
That happens this time of year.

143
00:33:18,332 --> 00:33:20,129
I was thinking...

144
00:33:20,772 --> 00:33:24,321
...of moving to a kinder,
more gentle climate.

145
00:33:24,572 --> 00:33:27,769
I thought I'd talk with you,
since you're the only family I have.

146
00:33:28,892 --> 00:33:30,644
Luther, you don't have me.

147
00:33:32,732 --> 00:33:34,643
You know what it's like
to be the only kid...

148
00:33:34,892 --> 00:33:36,883
...who got to talk about visiting day?

149
00:33:41,492 --> 00:33:44,882
This move, it would be
a permanent one, you understand.

150
00:33:47,012 --> 00:33:48,968
We never see each other anyway.

151
00:33:49,212 --> 00:33:51,646
We haven't since Mom died.
That's a year.

152
00:33:54,972 --> 00:33:58,487
Look, you chose your life.
You had that right.

153
00:33:59,012 --> 00:34:01,162
You were never around for me. Fine.

154
00:34:01,412 --> 00:34:03,721
I have no plans to be around for you.

155
00:34:07,572 --> 00:34:09,324
Wait a minute. Wait.

156
00:34:10,412 --> 00:34:11,811
You're lying, aren't you?

157
00:34:13,612 --> 00:34:16,763
Are you active again?
Is that why you're here now?

158
00:34:20,532 --> 00:34:21,851
I don't believe you.

159
00:34:24,892 --> 00:34:26,928
Oh, Christ!

160
00:34:27,292 --> 00:34:28,930
Father, what have you done?

161
00:34:45,812 --> 00:34:46,767
Christy Sullivan?

162
00:34:46,972 --> 00:34:47,927
Wife of Walter.

163
00:34:48,172 --> 00:34:51,244
Most likely came home,
stumbled onto a burglary.

164
00:34:51,452 --> 00:34:54,808
Some burglary.
I wish my carpets were this clean.

165
00:34:55,012 --> 00:34:57,082
I couldn't find
a single fingerprint.

166
00:34:57,292 --> 00:35:00,364
- Are you serious, Laura?
- It's like Mary Poppins was here.

167
00:35:00,612 --> 00:35:01,727
Where's Mr. Sullivan?

168
00:35:01,932 --> 00:35:02,728
Sorry, Seth.

169
00:35:02,972 --> 00:35:06,647
The entire Sullivan household went
to Barbados two days ago.

170
00:35:07,972 --> 00:35:09,200
Thanks for your support.

171
00:35:09,492 --> 00:35:11,323
Oh, no, wait. It gets worse.

172
00:35:11,532 --> 00:35:12,965
The shots came from here.

173
00:35:13,172 --> 00:35:15,891
If she stumbled on a burglary,
she should've been here.

174
00:35:16,092 --> 00:35:18,128
But she was killed
exactly where she is.

175
00:35:18,332 --> 00:35:20,926
See, the blood patterns indicate that.

176
00:35:22,332 --> 00:35:23,924
What is she doing here?

177
00:35:27,212 --> 00:35:31,728
Looks like someone sat here,
but I couldn't find any prints.

178
00:35:32,572 --> 00:35:35,962
So you think old man Sullivan
holed up in this chair...

179
00:35:36,172 --> 00:35:38,128
...and watched his wife perform?

180
00:35:39,132 --> 00:35:40,929
God, I hope not.

181
00:35:41,172 --> 00:35:43,925
For his sake.
You know, he's such a great man.

182
00:35:45,012 --> 00:35:46,570
Be careful digging that out.

183
00:35:46,772 --> 00:35:48,728
Looks like he tried to strangle her.

184
00:35:49,412 --> 00:35:52,131
Then he went to the door
to shoot her from behind?

185
00:35:53,412 --> 00:35:55,243
He also inspected her vagina.

186
00:35:58,132 --> 00:35:59,360
He did what?

187
00:35:59,572 --> 00:36:00,766
Why?

188
00:36:00,972 --> 00:36:03,327
Maybe he didn't remember
that he did her.

189
00:36:07,132 --> 00:36:09,726
A strong burglar with a weak mind.

190
00:36:09,972 --> 00:36:12,725
Obviously, it's another
open-and-shut case.

191
00:37:31,932 --> 00:37:33,923
<i>We can expect</i>
<i>tomorrow's temperatures...</i>

192
00:37:34,172 --> 00:37:37,130
<i>... to climb into the 70s</i>
<i>with lows around 50.</i>

193
00:37:37,532 --> 00:37:40,330
<i>Turner will start things off</i>
<i>for the Cougars.</i>

194
00:37:47,412 --> 00:37:49,528
<i>- One man to beat.</i>
<i>- He's going all the way!</i>

195
00:37:49,732 --> 00:37:52,530
<i>Nothing but clear sailing now.</i>

196
00:37:53,012 --> 00:37:53,808
<i>Six points!</i>

197
00:38:19,212 --> 00:38:20,725
Mr. Sullivan.

198
00:38:21,772 --> 00:38:22,966
Sorry to bother you.

199
00:38:23,212 --> 00:38:26,363
I'm Seth Frank, senior homicide
detective, Middletown County.

200
00:38:26,612 --> 00:38:29,331
My client is in no mood
for conversations.

201
00:38:29,532 --> 00:38:31,124
It's all right, Sandy.

202
00:38:31,932 --> 00:38:33,968
You're in charge of the case?

203
00:38:34,212 --> 00:38:35,281
Yes, sir.

204
00:38:35,492 --> 00:38:37,722
I've gotta ask you a few questions.

205
00:38:38,772 --> 00:38:39,807
What do you want?

206
00:38:40,532 --> 00:38:42,727
Positive identification?

207
00:38:43,692 --> 00:38:44,920
Yes...

208
00:38:45,412 --> 00:38:47,323
...that was my wife.

209
00:38:48,212 --> 00:38:49,088
Anything else?

210
00:38:50,292 --> 00:38:52,522
You'd been in Barbados for two days.

211
00:38:52,732 --> 00:38:55,246
I took the staff,
always do this time of year.

212
00:38:55,492 --> 00:38:57,130
Your wife didn't come with you.

213
00:38:57,332 --> 00:38:59,129
Well, she was.

214
00:38:59,572 --> 00:39:00,891
Had it all planned.

215
00:39:01,412 --> 00:39:03,130
But you know women.

216
00:39:03,572 --> 00:39:05,324
She changed her mind.

217
00:39:07,772 --> 00:39:11,128
I'd been married
to my Rebecca for 47 years.

218
00:39:12,172 --> 00:39:13,730
When she died...

219
00:39:14,612 --> 00:39:17,729
...I decided I never wanted
that pain again.

220
00:39:19,292 --> 00:39:21,522
One thing I knew about Christy...

221
00:39:22,132 --> 00:39:24,123
...she was going to outlive me.

222
00:39:24,412 --> 00:39:26,880
I think that's enough for today.

223
00:39:27,092 --> 00:39:30,129
Sir, I have to ask you
about the vault.

224
00:39:31,652 --> 00:39:34,212
You mean, the contents
of the vault, of course.

225
00:39:38,772 --> 00:39:39,727
Sandy, you go on.

226
00:39:39,972 --> 00:39:41,166
- Walter.
- No, really.

227
00:39:41,372 --> 00:39:43,727
I'm all right.
You go on to the reception.

228
00:39:45,372 --> 00:39:47,124
Obviously, I can't make it.

229
00:39:47,372 --> 00:39:49,328
I'm sure everyone will understand.

230
00:39:51,012 --> 00:39:52,650
You don't mean the contents.

231
00:39:54,692 --> 00:39:55,841
You mean the chair.

232
00:39:57,812 --> 00:39:59,404
You must ask about the chair.

233
00:40:00,332 --> 00:40:01,845
Yes, sir. I do.

234
00:40:02,452 --> 00:40:04,044
Why? Are they connected?

235
00:40:05,092 --> 00:40:08,402
Someone sat in it and may have
been involved in the murder.

236
00:40:10,772 --> 00:40:14,845
I have the deepest respect for you.
I'm sorry to have to do this.

237
00:40:15,092 --> 00:40:18,323
I promise you, none of this
will make my highlight reel.

238
00:40:19,092 --> 00:40:21,925
Well, I hoped I could satisfy her.

239
00:40:22,292 --> 00:40:23,930
But, you know...

240
00:40:24,612 --> 00:40:26,125
...she had needs.

241
00:40:26,772 --> 00:40:28,967
She didn't want to go
behind my back.

242
00:40:30,772 --> 00:40:33,127
She suggested the chair.

243
00:40:33,332 --> 00:40:36,722
She hoped I might get
to like sitting there.

244
00:40:37,172 --> 00:40:38,525
I didn't.

245
00:40:41,932 --> 00:40:44,321
For 80 years, I've tried to live...

246
00:40:45,212 --> 00:40:46,930
...a decent life.

247
00:40:47,412 --> 00:40:49,721
I've given a billion dollars
to charity.

248
00:40:49,972 --> 00:40:51,724
If this comes to trial...

249
00:40:52,012 --> 00:40:54,128
...none of that will be remembered.

250
00:40:55,092 --> 00:40:56,730
I'll just go out...

251
00:40:57,012 --> 00:40:58,730
...the joke of the world.

252
00:40:59,332 --> 00:41:02,324
I understand, sir.
I'll do what I can.

253
00:41:02,652 --> 00:41:04,722
Would you listen to me whine?

254
00:41:05,012 --> 00:41:07,845
I apologize, Mr. Frank.

255
00:41:08,932 --> 00:41:11,162
Just do your job
and I'll try to do mine.

256
00:41:11,372 --> 00:41:12,725
Yes, sir.

257
00:41:16,812 --> 00:41:18,530
I'm sorry, sir.

258
00:41:46,972 --> 00:41:49,611
Ladies and gentlemen, the President.

259
00:41:52,212 --> 00:41:53,406
Sandy.

260
00:41:53,972 --> 00:41:55,087
Mr. President.

261
00:41:57,372 --> 00:41:59,932
- Take a walk with me.
- Certainly, sir.

262
00:42:01,972 --> 00:42:03,803
Tell me about Walter. How is he?

263
00:42:04,372 --> 00:42:07,569
Well, he's 80 and alone, Mr. President.

264
00:42:07,812 --> 00:42:10,724
He understands that
officially my hands are tied.

265
00:42:10,932 --> 00:42:13,924
Yes, but he's very moved
by your concern, sir.

266
00:42:14,612 --> 00:42:16,762
Any news of the killer?

267
00:42:16,972 --> 00:42:19,327
Why isn't there?
Who's in charge of this?

268
00:42:19,572 --> 00:42:20,846
The top man.

269
00:42:21,092 --> 00:42:23,845
He spent eight years,
homicide work in New York.

270
00:42:24,092 --> 00:42:27,323
I understand how you feel.
It's hard to be patient.

271
00:42:27,532 --> 00:42:29,409
No one understands how I feel.

272
00:42:30,132 --> 00:42:32,168
I'm supposed to have all this power...

273
00:42:32,372 --> 00:42:34,932
...and I can't even help
my oldest friend.

274
00:42:35,732 --> 00:42:39,771
You and I know, more than any man alive,
Walter Sullivan put me here.

275
00:42:41,212 --> 00:42:42,804
Now when he needs me most...

276
00:42:43,812 --> 00:42:45,928
Well, he must feel abandoned.

277
00:42:51,692 --> 00:42:53,250
I'll have a press conference.

278
00:42:53,572 --> 00:42:57,167
I'll have Walter come and
I'll embrace him in front of the world.

279
00:42:59,012 --> 00:43:00,604
He'll treasure that.

280
00:43:03,252 --> 00:43:04,924
What a generous gesture.

281
00:43:05,612 --> 00:43:07,807
Thank you, sir. Thank you.

282
00:43:15,572 --> 00:43:17,005
Tennis elbow.

283
00:43:25,332 --> 00:43:27,323
This is getting worse, Gloria.

284
00:43:27,572 --> 00:43:29,164
I need to see a doctor.

285
00:43:29,372 --> 00:43:32,330
The country would have
to be informed, Mr. President.

286
00:43:33,012 --> 00:43:35,128
What happened to my rights to privacy?

287
00:43:35,932 --> 00:43:37,923
I think she nicked a tendon.

288
00:43:38,812 --> 00:43:40,768
Burton says it's a flesh wound.

289
00:43:42,732 --> 00:43:45,246
Since when did you
become an expert, Bill?

290
00:43:45,612 --> 00:43:46,886
You ever been wounded?

291
00:43:47,372 --> 00:43:48,725
Yes, sir. A few times.

292
00:43:54,172 --> 00:43:56,447
You're serious about
this press conference?

293
00:43:56,812 --> 00:43:58,131
Of course I am.

294
00:43:58,612 --> 00:44:00,409
Walter's like a father to me.

295
00:44:01,572 --> 00:44:03,403
Shall I bring Mrs. Richmond home?

296
00:44:04,532 --> 00:44:06,762
I don't think
Mrs. Richmond's mission...

297
00:44:07,012 --> 00:44:09,651
...to help the poor in Asia
needs to be interrupted.

298
00:44:11,292 --> 00:44:12,771
What do we know so far?

299
00:44:14,572 --> 00:44:16,324
We've checked his license plates.

300
00:44:16,572 --> 00:44:19,166
He stole the car from
a police impoundment lot.

301
00:44:20,812 --> 00:44:23,121
We're not dealing
with a fool, are we?

302
00:44:23,772 --> 00:44:25,125
Has he initiated contact?

303
00:44:26,012 --> 00:44:27,923
Burton doesn't think he will.

304
00:44:29,812 --> 00:44:31,131
I agree.

305
00:44:32,132 --> 00:44:34,088
I apologize for my behavior.

306
00:44:34,572 --> 00:44:36,722
Consider it a blip on the screen.

307
00:44:36,972 --> 00:44:39,167
As far as I'm concerned,
that's all he is.

308
00:44:40,172 --> 00:44:42,561
He could be a little more
than that, Alan.

309
00:44:42,772 --> 00:44:44,046
He saw.

310
00:44:44,252 --> 00:44:48,211
He saw nothing. He saw a drunk woman
who liked rough sex too much.

311
00:44:48,892 --> 00:44:51,122
He's a burglar.
Who's gonna believe him?

312
00:44:51,372 --> 00:44:54,330
After all, it's not as if
he has any evidence.

313
00:45:22,452 --> 00:45:24,522
<i>He's a burglar.</i>
<i>Who 's gonna believe him?</i>

314
00:45:24,772 --> 00:45:27,730
<i>After all, it's not as if</i>
<i>he has any evidence.</i>

315
00:46:32,012 --> 00:46:34,970
Boy, you always did
disappear good, Luther.

316
00:46:35,812 --> 00:46:38,326
You're trying to say
I have a weak face?

317
00:46:38,572 --> 00:46:40,324
No, I'm saying you're lucky.

318
00:46:40,572 --> 00:46:43,769
Some customers, no matter
what I do, still stand out.

319
00:46:44,012 --> 00:46:45,923
How many passports you want?

320
00:46:46,572 --> 00:46:48,164
Four ought to do the trick.

321
00:46:48,372 --> 00:46:51,967
You want different looks, matching
international driver's licenses.

322
00:46:52,212 --> 00:46:54,009
I'll throw in dummy credit cards.

323
00:46:54,812 --> 00:46:56,928
How are the rugs I made you
holding up?

324
00:46:57,212 --> 00:46:59,806
Good. The mustaches
and the beards also.

325
00:47:00,372 --> 00:47:02,602
We try to give quality
for our money.

326
00:47:03,612 --> 00:47:05,728
You leaving the country for permanent?

327
00:47:06,732 --> 00:47:07,767
That could be.

328
00:47:09,372 --> 00:47:13,331
Does it matter where you've been?
I hate doing Asian passport stamps.

329
00:47:13,532 --> 00:47:14,851
No. Make it European.

330
00:47:15,092 --> 00:47:19,085
Caribbean in the wintertime.
How long is all this gonna take?

331
00:47:20,172 --> 00:47:22,891
It usually takes time.
For you, I'll rush it.

332
00:47:24,572 --> 00:47:26,403
You're always dependable, Valerie.

333
00:47:27,172 --> 00:47:28,730
Listen, Luther...

334
00:47:29,172 --> 00:47:31,128
...I don't wanna know
what you're into.

335
00:47:31,332 --> 00:47:35,245
I do, but I'm not gonna ask you.
But leaving the country forever...

336
00:47:36,012 --> 00:47:36,967
What is it?

337
00:47:37,572 --> 00:47:39,642
I never figured you for a runner.

338
00:47:39,892 --> 00:47:43,328
Thirty percent of my runners
kill themselves within five years.

339
00:47:46,372 --> 00:47:49,011
Right now, five years
doesn't sound too bad.

340
00:47:50,652 --> 00:47:51,767
Take care.

341
00:47:53,372 --> 00:47:54,521
See you.

342
00:47:55,452 --> 00:47:57,727
Okay, see if this makes any sense.

343
00:47:58,012 --> 00:47:59,923
I am Christy Sullivan.

344
00:48:00,492 --> 00:48:02,767
I come in and I surprise a burglar.

345
00:48:03,932 --> 00:48:07,527
Okay, now you're the surprised burglar
coming from the vault.

346
00:48:07,772 --> 00:48:09,763
Gold star. I draw my gun. Boom.

347
00:48:10,012 --> 00:48:12,685
Then why strangle her
when you could just shoot her?

348
00:48:12,892 --> 00:48:16,168
Why do I bother to strip her
and put her clothes back on?

349
00:48:16,412 --> 00:48:17,970
There, I can help you out.

350
00:48:18,212 --> 00:48:21,648
You used to be a dry cleaner
and you love beautiful clothes.

351
00:48:21,892 --> 00:48:24,281
Thanks a lot.
And you dress her because...

352
00:48:24,492 --> 00:48:28,724
She was a good customer and you didn't
want her embarrassed when police came.

353
00:48:29,612 --> 00:48:32,968
She had a 0.21 blood-alcohol level.
Not that it matters.

354
00:48:33,212 --> 00:48:34,691
She didn't drive.

355
00:48:34,892 --> 00:48:38,123
The chauffeurs, they keep
exact mileage on these cars.

356
00:48:38,332 --> 00:48:40,243
They haven't been driven
since they went to Barbados.

357
00:48:40,492 --> 00:48:43,245
I checked every cab
and limo service in the area.

358
00:48:43,492 --> 00:48:46,643
Somebody drove her home. Who?

359
00:48:46,892 --> 00:48:48,530
Why haven't they come forward?

360
00:48:48,732 --> 00:48:51,292
Maybe because whoever drove her
home killed her.

361
00:48:53,812 --> 00:48:54,608
Maybe.

362
00:48:55,292 --> 00:48:56,884
I love this case.

363
00:48:57,092 --> 00:48:58,161
Lieutenant?

364
00:48:58,372 --> 00:49:01,125
Sorry to bother you,
but the phone problems?

365
00:49:01,332 --> 00:49:02,970
- I took care of them.
- Thanks.

366
00:49:03,932 --> 00:49:05,524
Just part of the job.

367
00:49:06,092 --> 00:49:09,926
I hate people who say that.
It is your fucking job.

368
00:49:10,332 --> 00:49:12,402
Remember the bullet hole
in the wall?

369
00:49:12,692 --> 00:49:13,568
Guess what?

370
00:49:13,812 --> 00:49:14,927
No slug.

371
00:49:15,172 --> 00:49:18,847
Why take a slug out of the wall
when there's one stuck in her head?

372
00:49:19,092 --> 00:49:20,923
Different from the one in her body?

373
00:49:21,492 --> 00:49:24,529
Two different guns means two burglars.

374
00:49:24,732 --> 00:49:25,721
Two guys broke in?

375
00:49:25,932 --> 00:49:28,082
They both went out the window?
Bullshit.

376
00:49:29,092 --> 00:49:29,888
By the way...

377
00:49:30,332 --> 00:49:32,971
...why did he or they
go out the window anyway...

378
00:49:33,172 --> 00:49:37,962
...when he or they got in by breaking
a zillion dollar security system?

379
00:49:38,572 --> 00:49:41,166
Bill Burton from Secret Service
in the parking lot.

380
00:49:41,412 --> 00:49:45,121
Thanks, Bob.
What's he doing in the parking lot?

381
00:49:53,292 --> 00:49:54,441
Bill Burton. Hi.

382
00:49:54,692 --> 00:49:57,331
Hi. Seth Frank.
To what do I owe the honor?

383
00:49:57,532 --> 00:49:58,965
You must be going crazy...

384
00:49:59,172 --> 00:50:01,970
...but the boss is interested
about your progress.

385
00:50:02,212 --> 00:50:03,930
Maybe we could help each other.

386
00:50:04,132 --> 00:50:05,724
What do you have in mind?

387
00:50:06,292 --> 00:50:09,728
Well, you know how close
he and Sullivan are, right?

388
00:50:11,612 --> 00:50:13,728
The minute anything breaks...

389
00:50:14,492 --> 00:50:16,084
...I'll tell the President.

390
00:50:16,292 --> 00:50:18,567
He'd be the first
to alert Mr. Sullivan.

391
00:50:18,812 --> 00:50:20,131
It'd mean a lot to him.

392
00:50:20,812 --> 00:50:23,326
Any red tape you want cut, done.

393
00:50:24,532 --> 00:50:26,124
Here's my numbers.

394
00:50:27,212 --> 00:50:28,008
Any leads?

395
00:50:28,812 --> 00:50:30,882
We're still figuring out
what happened.

396
00:50:31,092 --> 00:50:34,050
- I love playing Sherlock Holmes.
- You guys do that?

397
00:50:34,492 --> 00:50:36,926
I was a state trooper
before the government got me.

398
00:50:37,332 --> 00:50:39,050
Wait. You're that Bill Burton?

399
00:50:39,372 --> 00:50:43,160
- I was younger and dumber then.
- I was younger. I'm dumber now.

400
00:50:43,412 --> 00:50:44,925
Keep in touch.

401
00:51:10,172 --> 00:51:12,970
My chef makes them especially for me.

402
00:51:13,172 --> 00:51:15,732
I promise you, they're sinful.

403
00:51:16,692 --> 00:51:18,728
You're a salesman, Mr. Sullivan.

404
00:51:20,012 --> 00:51:22,321
This is a new arena for me.

405
00:51:22,932 --> 00:51:26,402
But from what I'm told,
you have a flawless reputation.

406
00:51:27,092 --> 00:51:29,765
Which is why I need to employ you,
Mr. McCarty.

407
00:51:30,012 --> 00:51:30,842
Understood.

408
00:51:31,332 --> 00:51:33,971
I don't know who it is I'm after yet.

409
00:51:34,172 --> 00:51:35,651
Until I do...

410
00:51:35,892 --> 00:51:38,247
...you wait in Washington
for instructions.

411
00:51:40,772 --> 00:51:42,524
That's out of the question.

412
00:51:43,812 --> 00:51:45,370
Mine is not creative work.

413
00:51:45,612 --> 00:51:48,126
I do it because I enjoy
living beyond my means.

414
00:51:48,372 --> 00:51:50,283
I can't afford to sit around.

415
00:51:52,412 --> 00:51:55,370
My father died
when I was 10 years old.

416
00:51:55,572 --> 00:51:58,609
He was a miner.
He died of lung disease.

417
00:51:59,572 --> 00:52:01,802
I became rich at 25.

418
00:52:02,012 --> 00:52:05,322
The first thing I did was buy
that mine, close it down...

419
00:52:05,532 --> 00:52:09,525
...and give every miner
$50,000 to retire on.

420
00:52:12,332 --> 00:52:15,165
You will wait in Washington,
Mr. McCarty.

421
00:52:15,372 --> 00:52:19,524
And I will put
one million dollars' expenses...

422
00:52:19,732 --> 00:52:21,688
...in a Swiss bank of your choosing.

423
00:52:22,012 --> 00:52:24,207
And when the time comes...

424
00:52:24,812 --> 00:52:26,768
...2 million dollars a bullet.

425
00:52:29,292 --> 00:52:30,850
You are a salesman, sir.

426
00:52:33,612 --> 00:52:35,568
Selling sin is easy.

427
00:52:42,260 --> 00:52:44,376
- Who is he?
- It's Luther Whitney...

428
00:52:44,620 --> 00:52:46,975
...one of the great thieves
of the world.

429
00:52:47,740 --> 00:52:50,049
I've been going nuts.
I was up all night.

430
00:52:51,780 --> 00:52:54,613
I remembered your notion
how it was two burglars.

431
00:52:54,860 --> 00:52:58,170
Around dawn, I thought,
"What if it's not two burglars...

432
00:52:58,380 --> 00:53:01,417
...but just one guy trying
to make it look like two?"

433
00:53:02,380 --> 00:53:05,178
I called my buddy at the Bureau.
They keep track.

434
00:53:05,380 --> 00:53:08,975
There's only half a dozen guys
who could've done the Sullivan job.

435
00:53:09,220 --> 00:53:10,778
I've been tracing all six.

436
00:53:11,020 --> 00:53:12,931
Whitney's the only guy
that lives here.

437
00:53:13,580 --> 00:53:17,493
- Why haven't I ever heard of him?
- He hasn't been arrested in 30 years.

438
00:53:17,740 --> 00:53:20,379
What's this? His graduation
picture from Harvard?

439
00:53:20,580 --> 00:53:23,492
That's history.
He was just a punk, part of a gang.

440
00:53:23,940 --> 00:53:25,168
Three-time loser.

441
00:53:25,420 --> 00:53:26,819
Since he got out last...

442
00:53:27,540 --> 00:53:28,768
...no one's touched him.

443
00:53:30,220 --> 00:53:33,735
When something big comes up,
they question him, but nothing sticks.

444
00:53:33,940 --> 00:53:34,770
Oh, Seth.

445
00:53:35,500 --> 00:53:37,377
We can make this stick.

446
00:53:38,260 --> 00:53:39,579
I bet you he's our guy.

447
00:53:39,820 --> 00:53:42,414
He's a local.
You can't ask for anything more.

448
00:53:43,460 --> 00:53:45,018
Well, we got a problem.

449
00:53:45,260 --> 00:53:46,375
What?

450
00:53:47,660 --> 00:53:49,457
He hasn't killed anyone in 45 years.

451
00:53:50,660 --> 00:53:51,570
Korea.

452
00:53:51,820 --> 00:53:53,253
So what? He's a veteran.

453
00:53:53,460 --> 00:53:56,577
Not just a veteran,
he's a wounded veteran.

454
00:53:56,820 --> 00:53:58,572
I got his war record here.

455
00:53:58,900 --> 00:54:02,779
Battles, commendations,
decorations up the kazoo.

456
00:54:03,980 --> 00:54:05,652
He lives alone on disability.

457
00:54:05,860 --> 00:54:08,055
That's what he says anyway.

458
00:54:09,020 --> 00:54:12,171
But I don't see him as a killer.
He's just a great thief.

459
00:54:12,420 --> 00:54:14,980
And besides, I don't do war heroes.

460
00:54:59,660 --> 00:55:00,979
Boy, you must be smart.

461
00:55:02,540 --> 00:55:03,655
Pardon me?

462
00:55:04,820 --> 00:55:07,573
It usually takes you guys
a week to get to me.

463
00:55:09,740 --> 00:55:11,298
Oh, Seth Frank.

464
00:55:11,740 --> 00:55:14,573
I recognize your picture
from the newspaper.

465
00:55:14,820 --> 00:55:16,378
Luther Whitney.

466
00:55:17,220 --> 00:55:18,573
Nice to meet you.

467
00:55:19,620 --> 00:55:23,932
Would you like a signed confession now
or do you want coffee first?

468
00:55:24,140 --> 00:55:28,770
Before I send you away for life,
I should probably check out your alibi.

469
00:55:29,020 --> 00:55:32,615
I was watching a football game
with an old friend, Red Bransford.

470
00:55:32,860 --> 00:55:34,976
He owns a saloon here in town.

471
00:55:35,820 --> 00:55:37,617
You can ask me about the game.

472
00:55:37,860 --> 00:55:39,578
I could be lying.

473
00:55:40,660 --> 00:55:42,173
You been following the case?

474
00:55:42,380 --> 00:55:43,529
Yeah, I have.

475
00:55:43,740 --> 00:55:45,571
I love true crime.

476
00:55:46,020 --> 00:55:49,410
FBI says there's only a few guys
who could have handled this job.

477
00:55:49,660 --> 00:55:51,969
I got a list here.
You're on it.

478
00:55:52,540 --> 00:55:53,973
How I wish it were true.

479
00:55:56,260 --> 00:55:59,377
This person,
they go in the front door...

480
00:55:59,580 --> 00:56:02,572
...and out a window, down a rope
in the middle of the night?

481
00:56:03,380 --> 00:56:05,940
Now, if I could do
something like that...

482
00:56:06,140 --> 00:56:08,574
...I'd be the star
of my AARP meetings.

483
00:56:09,420 --> 00:56:13,572
- What's that? The American...
- Association of Retired Persons.

484
00:56:16,060 --> 00:56:18,176
Luther, why was this so difficult?

485
00:56:18,980 --> 00:56:21,414
You want me to help you
solve your case?

486
00:56:21,660 --> 00:56:23,218
Just looking for insight.

487
00:56:23,420 --> 00:56:24,773
How would you...?

488
00:56:25,340 --> 00:56:28,013
Scratch that.
How would one go about it?

489
00:56:28,260 --> 00:56:30,569
What kind of person
should I look for?

490
00:56:32,220 --> 00:56:35,212
Except for the rope trick,
an older person, like me.

491
00:56:35,460 --> 00:56:36,973
Because?

492
00:56:37,660 --> 00:56:39,378
Well, you need patience.

493
00:56:39,620 --> 00:56:42,771
The secret is research, research
and research. I've read that.

494
00:56:42,980 --> 00:56:44,698
What kind of research?

495
00:56:46,340 --> 00:56:49,776
Well, from what I saw on the tube,
this is a rather large home.

496
00:56:49,980 --> 00:56:52,289
Must be an architectural office.

497
00:56:52,540 --> 00:56:55,418
You'd go to the library,
go through public records...

498
00:56:55,660 --> 00:56:58,970
...find out where that architectural
office is and break in.

499
00:56:59,220 --> 00:57:02,576
And then you xerox the plans
and get them back by morning.

500
00:57:02,820 --> 00:57:04,697
Why not just steal them?

501
00:57:05,260 --> 00:57:07,410
Anyone can break into
an office, but doing it...

502
00:57:07,660 --> 00:57:10,777
...without having people know
you were there is the trick.

503
00:57:11,020 --> 00:57:13,375
Then there's the general contractor.

504
00:57:13,580 --> 00:57:15,969
And then there's the security company.

505
00:57:16,340 --> 00:57:20,936
Do you realize the skill of breaking
the security of a security company?

506
00:57:21,460 --> 00:57:23,769
I don't know how those guys do it.

507
00:57:25,420 --> 00:57:27,775
Why go to all that trouble, Luther?

508
00:57:28,540 --> 00:57:32,169
There's a vault in the house.
There must be a secret way into it.

509
00:57:32,380 --> 00:57:34,336
There was.
That's what I don't get.

510
00:57:35,180 --> 00:57:36,215
How do you mean?

511
00:57:36,460 --> 00:57:39,577
This guy obviously did
the research you're talking about.

512
00:57:39,820 --> 00:57:41,572
So why does he take a crowbar...

513
00:57:41,780 --> 00:57:44,897
...to open the vault when
there's a clicker right there?

514
00:57:45,140 --> 00:57:46,016
A clicker?

515
00:57:46,220 --> 00:57:49,178
Well, a gizmo, like a VCR remote.

516
00:57:51,660 --> 00:57:53,776
Sounds amazing to me.

517
00:57:55,180 --> 00:57:57,774
Must've been a lot
of valuables in that vault.

518
00:58:01,260 --> 00:58:03,979
Close to 5 million total value.

519
00:58:05,900 --> 00:58:07,253
Is that funny?

520
00:58:07,460 --> 00:58:09,610
I feel like you're trying
to surprise me.

521
00:58:09,860 --> 00:58:11,088
I was trying to.

522
00:58:11,540 --> 00:58:13,178
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

523
00:58:15,140 --> 00:58:16,778
There you go again.

524
00:58:20,620 --> 00:58:22,850
Would the burglar use a disguise?

525
00:58:23,340 --> 00:58:24,568
Yeah, he might.

526
00:58:25,060 --> 00:58:27,893
Get with the program
if you're gonna catch this guy.

527
00:58:28,140 --> 00:58:31,769
It is a guy we think, anyway.
Some sort of a Ioner? Weirdo?

528
00:58:32,020 --> 00:58:33,248
Maybe like you.

529
00:58:34,820 --> 00:58:37,778
Well, I'd be the perfect
prototype, actually.

530
00:58:37,980 --> 00:58:41,416
Except you see a face around
long enough and put things together.

531
00:58:41,660 --> 00:58:44,618
That's why these top guys
have disguises.

532
00:58:44,820 --> 00:58:48,096
Some of them, I even understand,
become makeup experts...

533
00:58:48,340 --> 00:58:50,217
...hire wigmakers
and things like that.

534
00:58:50,980 --> 00:58:52,811
Go on about the wigmakers.

535
00:58:53,060 --> 00:58:53,890
I would...

536
00:58:54,940 --> 00:58:57,170
I've gotta go have
my pacemaker checked.

537
00:58:57,380 --> 00:58:59,735
It's been so exciting talking to you.

538
00:59:00,340 --> 00:59:03,730
A: You don't have a pacemaker.
And B: I'll be back tomorrow.

539
00:59:05,140 --> 00:59:07,574
Tomorrow is promised to no one.

540
00:59:10,780 --> 00:59:11,974
Goodbye.

541
00:59:16,780 --> 00:59:18,771
Pacemaker, my ass.

542
01:00:17,260 --> 01:00:19,012
Oh, Katie.

543
01:00:19,740 --> 01:00:22,573
You gotta start eating
better than this, darling.

544
01:00:26,140 --> 01:00:28,779
I'm having this
press conference here...

545
01:00:29,860 --> 01:00:32,772
...because it is here,
at this courthouse...

546
01:00:33,660 --> 01:00:36,970
...that Christine Sullivan's killer
will be tried.

547
01:00:37,740 --> 01:00:40,379
As you know, I came from
an impoverished family...

548
01:00:41,420 --> 01:00:43,615
<i>... in an impoverished town.</i>

549
01:00:44,860 --> 01:00:46,373
<i>We lived with our doors...</i>

550
01:00:46,740 --> 01:00:48,173
<i>... unlocked.</i>

551
01:00:49,180 --> 01:00:51,569
<i>We all lock our doors now.</i>

552
01:00:51,980 --> 01:00:54,414
<i>- That's not what concerns me.</i>
- A ginger ale.

553
01:00:54,620 --> 01:00:56,815
<i>We are also locking our hearts.</i>

554
01:00:57,020 --> 01:00:58,419
Could you turn that off?

555
01:00:58,620 --> 01:01:00,531
<i>- That is the sadness.</i>
- In a second.

556
01:01:00,860 --> 01:01:01,895
That...

557
01:01:02,140 --> 01:01:03,414
...is the loss.

558
01:01:04,580 --> 01:01:06,855
We are locking our hearts
to the weary.

559
01:01:07,460 --> 01:01:09,416
<i>We are locking our hearts...</i>

560
01:01:09,660 --> 01:01:11,969
<i>... to the poor and their pain.</i>

561
01:01:12,980 --> 01:01:14,208
<i>Sisters and brothers...</i>

562
01:01:14,460 --> 01:01:17,020
<i>... we are locking our hearts</i>
<i>to ourselves.</i>

563
01:01:21,420 --> 01:01:22,535
Turn it back on.

564
01:01:22,740 --> 01:01:24,059
- But you said...
- I know...

565
01:01:24,260 --> 01:01:25,215
...but turn it on.

566
01:01:29,980 --> 01:01:34,292
<i>We feel that savagery and violence</i>
<i>must be allowed a place at table.</i>

567
01:01:34,540 --> 01:01:36,371
<i>That is wrong.</i>
<i>That is not America.</i>

568
01:01:37,220 --> 01:01:38,858
<i>I shall fight that battle.</i>

569
01:01:39,140 --> 01:01:40,573
Dear friend...

570
01:01:41,060 --> 01:01:42,573
...old friend...

571
01:01:45,580 --> 01:01:47,571
...we shall fight that battle.

572
01:01:52,660 --> 01:01:54,378
Who can explain chance?

573
01:01:55,660 --> 01:01:57,173
If we had not met...

574
01:01:57,420 --> 01:01:59,570
...I would not be President today.

575
01:02:00,260 --> 01:02:02,899
If Christine had not taken ill...

576
01:02:03,220 --> 01:02:05,973
<i>... she would be with you</i>
<i>in Barbados even now.</i>

577
01:02:06,940 --> 01:02:09,170
<i>Walter, you've been</i>
<i>like a father to me.</i>

578
01:02:11,940 --> 01:02:15,569
<i>I would give the world</i>
<i>to lessen your pain.</i>

579
01:02:31,260 --> 01:02:32,579
<i>Thank you.</i>

580
01:02:35,020 --> 01:02:37,215
You heartless whore.

581
01:02:39,940 --> 01:02:42,374
I'm not about to run from you.

582
01:02:45,580 --> 01:02:49,289
Thomas Jefferson used
the Green Room as a dining room.

583
01:02:49,540 --> 01:02:51,610
The walls are covered
with green silk...

584
01:02:51,860 --> 01:02:54,613
...just as they were
when James Monroe was President.

585
01:02:54,860 --> 01:02:58,011
Many valuable objects
and paintings in this room.

586
01:02:58,220 --> 01:03:00,051
We'll move on to the Blue Room.

587
01:03:01,540 --> 01:03:04,293
James Hoban built
the Blue Room as an oval...

588
01:03:04,540 --> 01:03:06,770
...to please President Washington.

589
01:03:07,780 --> 01:03:09,816
During the holiday season...

590
01:03:10,060 --> 01:03:13,370
...the White House Christmas tree
stands in the middle.

591
01:03:13,620 --> 01:03:16,896
The view from the window
includes the Jefferson Memorial.

592
01:03:17,140 --> 01:03:19,370
We'll be moving on to the Red Room.

593
01:03:22,820 --> 01:03:26,699
The walls of the Red Room
are covered with red silk.

594
01:03:30,740 --> 01:03:34,096
He was in the building.
He took a guided tour.

595
01:03:39,860 --> 01:03:42,374
I've never dealt
with blackmail before.

596
01:03:42,620 --> 01:03:46,169
- He doesn't want money.
- You're a mind reader too now.

597
01:03:46,420 --> 01:03:48,775
No, I just looked on the back.

598
01:03:49,820 --> 01:03:50,616
See?

599
01:03:50,860 --> 01:03:52,578
"I don't want money."

600
01:03:52,820 --> 01:03:55,414
He has the guts of a burglar.
Wish we had him.

601
01:03:55,620 --> 01:03:57,372
Finished your recruiting speech?

602
01:03:58,940 --> 01:04:01,534
Because I'd like to know
how I handle this.

603
01:04:02,020 --> 01:04:03,976
Like you handled the letter opener?

604
01:04:10,860 --> 01:04:12,373
Gee, Bill...

605
01:04:14,580 --> 01:04:18,016
...that could be construed
as criticism.

606
01:04:20,060 --> 01:04:21,812
You want me for an enemy?

607
01:04:22,260 --> 01:04:25,377
I should've called the police
that night but I was weak.

608
01:04:25,620 --> 01:04:28,259
You convinced me to stay silent.
I regret that.

609
01:04:28,780 --> 01:04:30,213
Know this:

610
01:04:30,820 --> 01:04:34,051
Every time I see your face,
I wanna rip your throat out.

611
01:04:41,140 --> 01:04:42,368
Fine.

612
01:04:44,740 --> 01:04:46,776
You win the pissing contest.

613
01:04:58,660 --> 01:04:59,809
What do I do?

614
01:05:00,020 --> 01:05:01,214
Nothing.

615
01:05:01,420 --> 01:05:04,776
He's making a mistake.
He thinks he has time. He doesn't.

616
01:05:04,980 --> 01:05:07,653
Seth Frank's too good.
He'll bring him in.

617
01:05:08,380 --> 01:05:09,495
Then what?

618
01:05:11,060 --> 01:05:12,129
Then I kill him.

619
01:05:19,580 --> 01:05:20,808
Miss Whitney?

620
01:05:21,060 --> 01:05:22,379
Thanks.

621
01:05:31,980 --> 01:05:33,049
Miss Whitney?

622
01:05:34,220 --> 01:05:36,495
I'm Seth Frank. Excuse me.

623
01:05:43,420 --> 01:05:44,569
Thanks.

624
01:05:48,380 --> 01:05:51,770
For a tough prosecutor, you sure
don't resemble your reputation.

625
01:05:53,020 --> 01:05:54,294
Is that good or bad?

626
01:05:58,420 --> 01:05:59,375
I don't know.

627
01:06:01,820 --> 01:06:04,380
Look, lieutenant,
I told you on the phone.

628
01:06:04,780 --> 01:06:08,853
I'm not involved with my father.
So this is a waste of time.

629
01:06:09,660 --> 01:06:12,174
Do you expect me to walk out of here?

630
01:06:14,540 --> 01:06:15,575
All right.

631
01:06:17,780 --> 01:06:18,974
All right.

632
01:06:19,780 --> 01:06:21,577
Your father disappeared.

633
01:06:24,660 --> 01:06:26,616
- I need your help.
- Look.

634
01:06:26,860 --> 01:06:29,010
Lieutenant, I don't know the man.

635
01:06:29,260 --> 01:06:33,219
He was in jail. When he got out,
my mom and I lived by ourselves.

636
01:06:33,460 --> 01:06:35,610
He doesn't care about me.

637
01:06:35,860 --> 01:06:37,771
I've seen him once this past year.

638
01:06:38,020 --> 01:06:39,373
Yeah, when?

639
01:06:40,660 --> 01:06:41,536
A few days ago.

640
01:06:43,260 --> 01:06:46,809
He said he might leave town.
I helped you. Can I work now?

641
01:06:47,940 --> 01:06:50,500
- Any idea where he went?
- Quit wasting my time.

642
01:06:50,740 --> 01:06:52,776
He doesn't want you to find him,
you won't.

643
01:06:53,020 --> 01:06:55,170
You're saying
he skipped the country?

644
01:06:55,380 --> 01:06:57,689
I'm saying you won't recognize him.

645
01:06:58,620 --> 01:07:00,497
He could be right around the corner.

646
01:07:02,340 --> 01:07:04,171
- He always had a safe house.
- Where?

647
01:07:04,380 --> 01:07:05,176
He never said.

648
01:07:05,420 --> 01:07:06,978
How do you know he had one?

649
01:07:08,660 --> 01:07:10,412
My mother loved him, all right?

650
01:07:10,620 --> 01:07:14,818
Even after she left him, when she was
dying, he was all she talked about.

651
01:07:15,820 --> 01:07:17,970
"If only he hadn't done this.

652
01:07:18,220 --> 01:07:20,780
- Lf only he hadn't done that."
- What else?

653
01:07:25,500 --> 01:07:27,695
- How long has he lived here?
- Years.

654
01:07:27,940 --> 01:07:29,168
Never been.

655
01:07:33,460 --> 01:07:36,418
This is a strange place
for a thief to leave a key.

656
01:07:36,660 --> 01:07:38,571
He always did that.

657
01:08:51,940 --> 01:08:56,172
He left in a hurry. I wonder what
scares a professional thief like that.

658
01:09:07,420 --> 01:09:09,570
He wasn't at these places.

659
01:09:11,300 --> 01:09:13,768
My college graduation...

660
01:09:15,220 --> 01:09:18,735
...my law school graduation,
the night my mother and I...

661
01:09:18,940 --> 01:09:22,979
...we went out to celebrate
because I'd gotten my first job.

662
01:09:23,780 --> 01:09:26,214
Me alone on the steps.
I'd won my first case.

663
01:09:29,940 --> 01:09:31,851
I used to think sometimes...

664
01:09:36,060 --> 01:09:40,178
Sometimes I'd come home and could sense
that he'd been in the apartment.

665
01:09:40,540 --> 01:09:45,455
That he'd checked the fridge, shook
his head because I never ate right.

666
01:09:46,660 --> 01:09:50,369
I mean, I know it sounds crazy,
but I've always...

667
01:09:50,940 --> 01:09:53,170
I've always felt
that he was around.

668
01:09:53,740 --> 01:09:56,095
You can do a good thing.
Help me bring him in.

669
01:09:56,340 --> 01:09:58,376
Leave a message
you're worried about him.

670
01:09:58,860 --> 01:09:59,815
No.

671
01:10:00,020 --> 01:10:02,818
It's true. You're worried.
This is no normal case.

672
01:10:03,060 --> 01:10:06,018
His life is in danger.
You call, you could save him.

673
01:10:06,620 --> 01:10:07,814
He won't come.

674
01:10:08,020 --> 01:10:10,375
Of course he'll come.
You're all he has.

675
01:10:10,820 --> 01:10:14,051
He's on the run and he's scared
because he'll get caught.

676
01:10:14,460 --> 01:10:16,894
- You don't know the heat.
- He's not a murderer.

677
01:10:17,620 --> 01:10:19,338
Maybe he is innocent.

678
01:10:19,860 --> 01:10:22,579
If that's true, I'll have him
home in a few hours.

679
01:10:24,460 --> 01:10:27,930
What if a hotshot trying to
make a reputation tracks him down?

680
01:10:30,460 --> 01:10:32,690
I can guarantee his safety.

681
01:10:32,940 --> 01:10:35,329
You make the call,
I'll make a promise.

682
01:10:35,860 --> 01:10:37,293
You'll have him back.

683
01:10:54,980 --> 01:10:57,369
<i>- Seth Frank.</i>
- Hi.

684
01:10:58,340 --> 01:11:00,376
I left a message on his machine.

685
01:11:00,620 --> 01:11:04,613
He called me back within the hour
and I'm meeting him tomorrow.

686
01:11:05,260 --> 01:11:06,329
Where?

687
01:11:07,860 --> 01:11:10,328
Open-air place near my office,
Cafe Alonzo.

688
01:11:11,100 --> 01:11:12,010
What time?

689
01:11:12,820 --> 01:11:14,173
<i>Four o 'clock.</i>

690
01:11:15,260 --> 01:11:16,978
<i>It'll be deserted then.</i>

691
01:11:18,460 --> 01:11:20,178
<i>Sounds good. Thanks a lot.</i>

692
01:11:20,380 --> 01:11:22,177
- Bye.
<i>- Bye-bye.</i>

693
01:12:09,860 --> 01:12:11,134
<i>Dad, hi.</i>

694
01:12:11,340 --> 01:12:13,376
<i>It's Kate calling.</i>

695
01:12:13,580 --> 01:12:17,414
<i>I was wondering</i>
<i>if you could call me, please.</i>

696
01:12:18,580 --> 01:12:22,368
<i>There's some things I'd like</i>
<i>to talk with you about...</i>

697
01:12:22,580 --> 01:12:25,890
<i>... and maybe even get together,</i>
<i>if that's possible.</i>

698
01:12:26,140 --> 01:12:27,368
<i>Okay?</i>

699
01:12:27,940 --> 01:12:30,977
<i>Thanks and talk to you soon. Bye.</i>

700
01:12:35,220 --> 01:12:36,369
<i>Dad, hi.</i>

701
01:12:36,580 --> 01:12:38,616
<i>It's Kate calling.</i>

702
01:12:38,860 --> 01:12:42,978
<i>I was wondering</i>
<i>if you could call me, please.</i>

703
01:12:43,860 --> 01:12:47,569
<i>There's some things I'd like</i>
<i>to talk with you about...</i>

704
01:12:47,820 --> 01:12:49,139
<i>... and maybe even get together.</i>

705
01:13:13,060 --> 01:13:16,416
So you all know where and when
you're supposed to be there.

706
01:13:16,660 --> 01:13:18,412
He's slippery. He's an eel.

707
01:13:18,660 --> 01:13:20,696
He gets a whiff of a cop,
he disappears.

708
01:13:20,940 --> 01:13:22,817
Nobody moves until I order you.

709
01:13:23,460 --> 01:13:24,813
Then we move in on him.

710
01:13:25,060 --> 01:13:29,338
Expect Whitney to show up at 4.
His daughter will be waiting for him.

711
01:13:29,540 --> 01:13:32,100
It's important to stay
in your positions...

712
01:13:32,340 --> 01:13:35,013
...until you hear the order
to move in on him.

713
01:14:06,340 --> 01:14:07,170
Here you go.

714
01:14:07,380 --> 01:14:09,018
Could I have some cream?

715
01:14:25,540 --> 01:14:27,576
Gather around, gentlemen.

716
01:14:28,500 --> 01:14:31,014
Nobody moves till
the suspect's in place.

717
01:14:31,260 --> 01:14:32,659
Any questions?

718
01:14:33,180 --> 01:14:34,977
See you at the Alonzo.

719
01:14:35,580 --> 01:14:36,569
Boss is grateful.

720
01:14:36,780 --> 01:14:39,214
He'd appreciate
an eyewitness at the capture.

721
01:14:39,460 --> 01:14:41,371
This is our guy.

722
01:14:41,660 --> 01:14:44,652
If he isn't, he sure disappeared fast.
See you there.

723
01:16:06,260 --> 01:16:07,579
Tums?

724
01:16:08,620 --> 01:16:09,973
I got my own.

725
01:16:30,620 --> 01:16:32,178
Come on, Kate.

726
01:16:32,580 --> 01:16:34,969
- She gonna show?
- Yeah, she'll be here.

727
01:18:15,860 --> 01:18:16,975
Miss?

728
01:18:17,940 --> 01:18:19,578
What you want, please?

729
01:18:20,580 --> 01:18:22,093
Nothing. Thank you.

730
01:18:22,300 --> 01:18:23,653
Got to.

731
01:18:24,660 --> 01:18:25,456
Pardon?

732
01:18:26,060 --> 01:18:27,891
You sit, you eat, please.

733
01:18:28,580 --> 01:18:31,777
Jeez, this guy wasn't part
of my master plan.

734
01:18:32,740 --> 01:18:33,809
Unbelievable.

735
01:18:34,380 --> 01:18:36,211
I'm waiting for someone.

736
01:18:36,900 --> 01:18:38,856
Oh, he must eat too, please.

737
01:18:39,060 --> 01:18:41,415
He will. We will.
We're gonna...

738
01:18:41,660 --> 01:18:43,969
We'll order half the menu.
Just not now.

739
01:18:47,140 --> 01:18:49,779
Maybe that's him disguised
as a Chinaman.

740
01:19:44,140 --> 01:19:45,732
Check out this guy in the hat.

741
01:19:48,260 --> 01:19:50,376
I believe that's our man.

742
01:19:51,140 --> 01:19:53,415
All units, suspect's approaching.

743
01:19:53,660 --> 01:19:55,651
Stay in place.
Wait for my signal.

744
01:20:11,340 --> 01:20:13,854
I did not kill her.
I want you to believe that.

745
01:20:17,900 --> 01:20:20,016
Just hold on.
Let him get settled.

746
01:20:23,060 --> 01:20:24,539
You've gotta believe that.

747
01:20:27,660 --> 01:20:29,332
I think we're ready.

748
01:20:42,860 --> 01:20:43,656
Damn it!

749
01:21:13,180 --> 01:21:13,976
Almost.

750
01:21:21,060 --> 01:21:22,095
You okay?

751
01:21:22,420 --> 01:21:23,819
What was that?

752
01:21:25,260 --> 01:21:27,012
Anyone see where those came from?

753
01:21:27,260 --> 01:21:29,694
- Did you do that?
- No, we didn't do it!

754
01:21:29,940 --> 01:21:31,771
Anyone see where
those shots came from?

755
01:21:35,220 --> 01:21:36,369
Where's Whitney?

756
01:21:36,580 --> 01:21:39,174
Quit standing around here!
Go find him!

757
01:21:46,420 --> 01:21:47,216
Take it easy.

758
01:21:47,460 --> 01:21:48,688
Take it easy.

759
01:21:48,940 --> 01:21:51,408
Take it easy, now.
Stay calm. Stay calm.

760
01:21:51,660 --> 01:21:53,571
There's no reason to panic.

761
01:21:53,860 --> 01:21:56,772
If everyone will just
kindly take it easy.

762
01:22:18,940 --> 01:22:19,929
Messy.

763
01:22:20,380 --> 01:22:21,972
I like that in a woman.

764
01:22:25,060 --> 01:22:26,175
Here.

765
01:22:30,260 --> 01:22:32,171
I got a few numbers here.

766
01:22:32,660 --> 01:22:34,378
The top one's...

767
01:22:35,060 --> 01:22:38,018
...Iocal police. That's
my office, my home, beeper.

768
01:22:38,860 --> 01:22:41,499
I live alone too.
You can call anytime.

769
01:22:44,340 --> 01:22:46,137
Want me to get
someone to stay here?

770
01:22:47,420 --> 01:22:49,809
No, I wanna get some sleep.

771
01:22:50,060 --> 01:22:52,210
Surveillance is outside
until it's over.

772
01:22:52,460 --> 01:22:54,735
I've got a feeling he'll contact you.

773
01:22:55,860 --> 01:22:57,691
You're on a hot streak, I guess.

774
01:22:59,060 --> 01:23:00,778
Listen, I'm sorry.

775
01:23:04,780 --> 01:23:06,736
Anything unusual at all...

776
01:23:07,180 --> 01:23:08,772
...call right away.

777
01:23:09,020 --> 01:23:10,453
It's not a bother.

778
01:23:12,460 --> 01:23:13,688
I live alone.

779
01:23:15,620 --> 01:23:17,178
You said.

780
01:23:18,540 --> 01:23:19,973
Feeble.

781
01:23:23,380 --> 01:23:25,450
You want something for the road?

782
01:23:27,340 --> 01:23:28,978
I got water and water.

783
01:23:31,220 --> 01:23:32,050
Deal.

784
01:23:47,060 --> 01:23:48,971
A Pellegrino would be great.

785
01:23:51,020 --> 01:23:53,170
What's so funny?
I say it wrong?

786
01:23:54,660 --> 01:23:56,378
I'm tired.

787
01:23:57,220 --> 01:23:58,778
I'm just tired.

788
01:24:09,060 --> 01:24:10,573
Listen...

789
01:24:10,780 --> 01:24:12,372
...there's one thing...

790
01:24:13,220 --> 01:24:14,972
...I forgot to tell you.

791
01:24:17,020 --> 01:24:18,578
I live alone.

792
01:24:23,620 --> 01:24:25,019
Lock up behind me.

793
01:24:30,460 --> 01:24:31,973
- How's that?
- Real good.

794
01:24:32,180 --> 01:24:33,977
Now get some sleep.

795
01:24:34,660 --> 01:24:36,173
Thank you.

796
01:24:43,540 --> 01:24:46,373
I betrayed you twice, Luther.
You should know that.

797
01:24:46,660 --> 01:24:48,378
You're not the first.

798
01:24:55,340 --> 01:24:56,568
Why'd you come?

799
01:24:57,420 --> 01:24:59,934
I can't have my daughter
thinking I was a murderer.

800
01:25:02,780 --> 01:25:05,977
No, I mean this afternoon.
Why'd you come?

801
01:25:06,220 --> 01:25:08,893
You suspected something
or you wouldn't have prepared.

802
01:25:09,140 --> 01:25:11,176
My daughter wanted to see me.

803
01:25:16,940 --> 01:25:19,977
The robbery was going fine
until they came in.

804
01:25:20,420 --> 01:25:21,614
They were drunk.

805
01:25:21,860 --> 01:25:23,976
I was hidden in the vault.

806
01:25:24,180 --> 01:25:26,410
And the sex had started
getting rough...

807
01:25:26,620 --> 01:25:28,576
...and he started beating her...

808
01:25:28,860 --> 01:25:31,613
...started strangling her.
I thought he'd kill her.

809
01:25:31,860 --> 01:25:35,569
Then she somehow got the upper hand.

810
01:25:36,020 --> 01:25:39,854
She was gonna stab him with
a letter opener and two guys shot her.

811
01:25:40,820 --> 01:25:43,209
The same two guys
who tried for you today.

812
01:25:44,780 --> 01:25:45,974
Possibly.

813
01:25:46,220 --> 01:25:48,450
Unless Walter Sullivan
was taking a shot.

814
01:25:50,700 --> 01:25:52,611
It's a pretty powerful enemy.

815
01:25:52,860 --> 01:25:54,578
That's very good going.

816
01:25:56,220 --> 01:25:59,053
Not as powerful as
the President of the United States.

817
01:26:01,140 --> 01:26:02,209
That's right.

818
01:26:02,460 --> 01:26:04,690
Alan Richmond, he was the drunk.

819
01:26:05,540 --> 01:26:07,371
The two guys were Secret Service.

820
01:26:07,620 --> 01:26:10,214
Chief of Staff Russell
handled the cover-up.

821
01:26:11,140 --> 01:26:13,574
Well, then you go to the police.

822
01:26:13,860 --> 01:26:16,772
That's what innocent people do.
They go to the police.

823
01:26:16,980 --> 01:26:18,379
Sure.

824
01:26:18,580 --> 01:26:20,218
That young man who was here...

825
01:26:20,460 --> 01:26:22,974
...he'd believe me
over the President, right?

826
01:26:24,340 --> 01:26:25,853
Why should I believe you?

827
01:26:27,580 --> 01:26:29,571
Because I swear to you, Kate.

828
01:26:30,020 --> 01:26:31,897
I swear to you on Mattie's grave.

829
01:26:33,180 --> 01:26:34,169
That's right.

830
01:26:34,620 --> 01:26:38,374
Your mother's grave. I'd kill myself
before I'd lie about that.

831
01:26:40,140 --> 01:26:41,778
Oh, Jesus, Luther.

832
01:26:42,020 --> 01:26:43,976
- Yeah. I know.
- They'll kill you.

833
01:26:46,380 --> 01:26:48,974
- I know.
- Can you run?

834
01:26:50,660 --> 01:26:54,175
I was all set to.
I was at the airport ready to go.

835
01:26:54,980 --> 01:26:56,971
Then there was that press conference.

836
01:26:57,940 --> 01:27:01,376
And there was Richmond
using old man Sullivan.

837
01:27:03,340 --> 01:27:05,774
You know, I might not
have been able to...

838
01:27:06,020 --> 01:27:08,375
...save Christy Sullivan...

839
01:27:09,260 --> 01:27:10,852
...but I didn't even try.

840
01:27:12,460 --> 01:27:13,973
What are you gonna do?

841
01:27:17,260 --> 01:27:19,216
I'll think of something.

842
01:27:27,940 --> 01:27:30,613
I watched you argue a case last year.

843
01:27:30,820 --> 01:27:31,809
You won it.

844
01:27:33,060 --> 01:27:35,449
Thank God you got
your mother's brains.

845
01:27:36,820 --> 01:27:37,969
Dangerous outside.

846
01:27:40,420 --> 01:27:42,138
It always is.

847
01:28:03,220 --> 01:28:04,778
Excuse me.

848
01:28:05,180 --> 01:28:07,250
Could you give this
to Gloria Russell?

849
01:28:07,500 --> 01:28:11,175
- Anything for me to sign?
- No, you have an honest face.

850
01:28:48,820 --> 01:28:50,572
Oh, my God.

851
01:29:11,860 --> 01:29:13,418
You're a vision tonight.

852
01:29:13,860 --> 01:29:16,772
Thank you, Mr. President.

853
01:29:17,260 --> 01:29:19,649
And thank you, Mr. President.

854
01:29:19,860 --> 01:29:22,169
For...?
Come again.

855
01:29:27,700 --> 01:29:28,496
You know.

856
01:29:32,660 --> 01:29:35,379
You sent it to me this afternoon.

857
01:29:36,660 --> 01:29:37,979
Of course.

858
01:29:40,260 --> 01:29:42,820
Would you excuse me, all?

859
01:29:43,060 --> 01:29:46,575
I'm overcome with a desire
to dance with my chief of staff.

860
01:29:47,220 --> 01:29:49,370
Look after this for me, would you?

861
01:30:10,740 --> 01:30:12,571
What is this nonsense?

862
01:30:12,860 --> 01:30:14,771
I'm hoping there's an explanation.

863
01:30:15,420 --> 01:30:17,888
Your gift, Alan. I was...

864
01:30:18,140 --> 01:30:19,573
...overwhelmed.

865
01:30:19,820 --> 01:30:23,176
And, you know, your note
was so gratifying.

866
01:30:28,260 --> 01:30:29,454
I sent a note?

867
01:30:30,260 --> 01:30:32,012
Yes, yes.

868
01:30:32,260 --> 01:30:34,455
You think I don't know your writing?

869
01:30:34,700 --> 01:30:37,419
I assumed you wanted me
to wear it tonight.

870
01:30:37,820 --> 01:30:40,380
- Gloria, it's lovely.
- Yes.

871
01:30:40,580 --> 01:30:42,172
And you know what else?

872
01:30:43,380 --> 01:30:44,574
What, Alan?

873
01:30:46,860 --> 01:30:49,294
Christy wore it the night
she was killed.

874
01:30:56,820 --> 01:30:58,014
Know what this means?

875
01:30:58,220 --> 01:30:59,414
No.

876
01:30:59,660 --> 01:31:01,378
Whitney's been heard from.

877
01:31:08,660 --> 01:31:11,128
It's not precisely the first time.

878
01:31:14,820 --> 01:31:16,811
You been keeping things from me?

879
01:31:18,740 --> 01:31:22,415
Well, it's just that you have
so much on your plate.

880
01:31:22,660 --> 01:31:24,616
We wanted to spare you.

881
01:31:28,820 --> 01:31:31,288
He sent me a Polaroid...

882
01:31:31,540 --> 01:31:33,770
...of the letter opener yesterday.

883
01:31:49,180 --> 01:31:51,171
I have to give this some thought.

884
01:31:55,140 --> 01:31:57,176
Come to my office in the morning.

885
01:31:58,260 --> 01:32:01,172
This'll make an interesting
chapter in my memoirs.

886
01:32:14,780 --> 01:32:16,896
Do we know who the forger is?

887
01:32:17,140 --> 01:32:21,179
I talked to Seth Frank. Apparently,
Whitney learned how in prison.

888
01:32:24,660 --> 01:32:26,173
A gifted man.

889
01:32:27,860 --> 01:32:29,293
How close are we to him?

890
01:32:30,020 --> 01:32:31,931
We're working around the clock.

891
01:32:33,780 --> 01:32:35,577
Well, that's good to know.

892
01:32:36,700 --> 01:32:37,974
He'll make a mistake.

893
01:32:38,740 --> 01:32:40,571
Well, that's good to know too.

894
01:32:48,140 --> 01:32:49,334
There is...

895
01:32:49,540 --> 01:32:51,371
...one other thing...

896
01:32:52,140 --> 01:32:53,971
...that we need to take care of.

897
01:32:56,460 --> 01:32:58,371
He has a daughter, doesn't he?

898
01:33:00,220 --> 01:33:01,733
You sure you wanna do that?

899
01:33:04,340 --> 01:33:05,534
Sir?

900
01:33:10,220 --> 01:33:14,054
She's a young prosecutor.
Prosecutors ask questions.

901
01:33:16,260 --> 01:33:18,330
Maybe she knows what he knows.

902
01:33:23,260 --> 01:33:24,773
Let's get cracking, boys.

903
01:33:28,660 --> 01:33:30,696
Show that you love your country.

904
01:33:54,500 --> 01:33:55,899
<i>How's Kate doing?</i>

905
01:33:56,300 --> 01:33:57,335
Where are you?

906
01:33:57,540 --> 01:34:00,134
I won't hang around for you
to trace the call.

907
01:34:00,340 --> 01:34:01,693
Just answer the question.

908
01:34:02,060 --> 01:34:04,096
She couldn't be in better hands.

909
01:34:04,300 --> 01:34:07,497
Secret Service is
taking over surveillance.

910
01:34:10,900 --> 01:34:12,094
<i>Hello?</i>

911
01:34:15,580 --> 01:34:16,899
<i>Hello?</i>

912
01:37:19,740 --> 01:37:21,492
It's entered in the chart.

913
01:37:22,380 --> 01:37:25,497
We upped her from
250 to 500 milligrams.

914
01:38:05,260 --> 01:38:07,490
Nurse, I need you right away, please.

915
01:38:08,060 --> 01:38:09,493
He's having a seizure.

916
01:39:11,940 --> 01:39:14,500
Dr. Kevorkian, I presume.

917
01:39:15,580 --> 01:39:19,289
My guess is that this is right
in your carotid artery about now.

918
01:39:20,180 --> 01:39:22,330
You're gonna get a little woozy.

919
01:39:22,780 --> 01:39:24,532
But if I give you the rest...

920
01:39:24,780 --> 01:39:27,897
...it'll fry your brain down
to the size of a peanut.

921
01:39:28,300 --> 01:39:29,494
Drop that.

922
01:39:43,980 --> 01:39:45,299
Luther...

923
01:39:46,300 --> 01:39:47,574
...he was my President.

924
01:39:48,460 --> 01:39:50,098
Right or wrong.

925
01:39:51,180 --> 01:39:52,932
Well, he made a mistake.

926
01:39:53,140 --> 01:39:54,459
You made a mistake.

927
01:39:57,100 --> 01:40:00,490
When you went after my girl,
that was entirely unacceptable.

928
01:40:03,100 --> 01:40:04,135
Mercy.

929
01:40:07,180 --> 01:40:08,533
I'm fresh out.

930
01:40:18,580 --> 01:40:19,615
Daddy?

931
01:40:23,300 --> 01:40:24,779
Go to sleep, darling.

932
01:40:55,460 --> 01:40:57,098
Oh, Jesus!

933
01:40:59,180 --> 01:41:00,613
Just one question.

934
01:41:00,860 --> 01:41:04,648
Did Walter Sullivan say
why Christy didn't go to Barbados?

935
01:41:05,660 --> 01:41:07,696
Just that she changed her mind.

936
01:41:08,580 --> 01:41:10,457
You know who did it, don't you?

937
01:41:12,260 --> 01:41:15,093
So will you.
Check your phones.

938
01:41:20,900 --> 01:41:22,492
Good night, Mr. Sullivan.

939
01:41:42,660 --> 01:41:44,651
You're taking a shortcut, Tommy?

940
01:41:47,900 --> 01:41:50,494
I'm your substitute driver tonight.

941
01:41:51,980 --> 01:41:54,050
Don't worry about Tommy.
He's fine.

942
01:41:54,740 --> 01:41:56,492
Very unusual.

943
01:41:57,260 --> 01:41:58,898
What do I call you?

944
01:41:59,780 --> 01:42:01,293
Luther, sir.

945
01:42:02,740 --> 01:42:06,210
And are you familiar with
how to get to my townhouse, Luther?

946
01:42:06,460 --> 01:42:08,098
Oh, yes, sir.

947
01:42:08,300 --> 01:42:10,256
I know where all your houses are.

948
01:42:10,460 --> 01:42:12,496
I'm the man who robbed you.

949
01:42:15,780 --> 01:42:18,010
You're the man who tried to kill me.

950
01:42:19,900 --> 01:42:22,095
I'm sorry I missed.

951
01:42:23,460 --> 01:42:26,099
I believe in the Old Testament, sir.

952
01:42:26,580 --> 01:42:28,935
There's nothing wrong with
an eye for an eye...

953
01:42:29,180 --> 01:42:30,818
...when a terrible deed is done.

954
01:42:31,620 --> 01:42:33,690
A deed such as yours.

955
01:42:34,540 --> 01:42:36,292
You'd like to believe that.

956
01:42:36,500 --> 01:42:38,889
That'd be simple for you
to believe that.

957
01:42:39,100 --> 01:42:41,295
What do I have to gain by being here?

958
01:42:42,100 --> 01:42:43,533
I have no idea.

959
01:42:43,780 --> 01:42:45,338
You going to rob me again?

960
01:42:45,700 --> 01:42:47,930
I don't need your money, Mr. Sullivan.

961
01:42:48,180 --> 01:42:50,489
Did you check your vault lately?

962
01:42:51,140 --> 01:42:53,096
I put everything back.

963
01:42:54,580 --> 01:42:57,890
I'm afraid we're a little late
for an attempt at leniency.

964
01:43:01,980 --> 01:43:04,289
A lot of crap's coming
down tonight, sir.

965
01:43:04,500 --> 01:43:06,138
You wanna be a player or not?

966
01:43:06,380 --> 01:43:08,814
You wanna know what happened
or don't you?

967
01:43:09,020 --> 01:43:10,692
Because I was there.

968
01:43:11,300 --> 01:43:12,653
I want to know.

969
01:43:13,260 --> 01:43:15,535
You think you can stand
hearing about it?

970
01:43:15,780 --> 01:43:18,010
How he beat her,
tried to strangle her?

971
01:43:18,260 --> 01:43:19,898
You really wanna know?

972
01:43:21,100 --> 01:43:23,534
I could walk through fire.

973
01:43:25,060 --> 01:43:27,096
I was in the vault when they came in.

974
01:43:27,300 --> 01:43:28,892
They were drunk.

975
01:43:29,100 --> 01:43:30,453
He knocked her around.

976
01:43:30,660 --> 01:43:32,491
She fought back.

977
01:43:33,180 --> 01:43:34,499
He got really rough.

978
01:43:34,740 --> 01:43:36,696
She tried to defend herself.

979
01:43:36,900 --> 01:43:38,697
Well, he started screaming...

980
01:43:38,900 --> 01:43:41,460
...sniveling simp he is.

981
01:43:41,660 --> 01:43:43,218
Who else was in my house?

982
01:43:43,420 --> 01:43:46,014
Secret Service.
They're the ones who shot her.

983
01:43:46,780 --> 01:43:47,769
Nonsense.

984
01:43:48,540 --> 01:43:50,610
Gloria Russell handled the cover-up.

985
01:43:50,820 --> 01:43:51,855
Stop this!

986
01:43:52,300 --> 01:43:53,858
You wanna know who it was?

987
01:43:54,060 --> 01:43:55,175
It was you.

988
01:43:55,660 --> 01:43:59,255
Come on, Mr. Sullivan.
We're too old to bullshit each other.

989
01:43:59,860 --> 01:44:01,009
Who was it, then?

990
01:44:01,220 --> 01:44:02,653
You know.

991
01:44:05,300 --> 01:44:06,653
Don't shake your head.

992
01:44:10,380 --> 01:44:13,531
When you're alone and rage takes over
and you want revenge...

993
01:44:13,780 --> 01:44:16,089
...what face do you put
with your enemy?

994
01:44:29,460 --> 01:44:30,779
Stop the car!

995
01:44:30,980 --> 01:44:32,572
We're going straight ahead.

996
01:44:34,740 --> 01:44:36,219
This is too terrible.

997
01:44:36,460 --> 01:44:38,098
Yes, it is.

998
01:44:39,780 --> 01:44:44,296
I know about Alan's reputation
as a philanderer...

999
01:44:44,940 --> 01:44:47,215
...but he'd never dream
of betraying me.

1000
01:44:49,860 --> 01:44:52,294
I gave him the Presidency.

1001
01:44:53,060 --> 01:44:54,618
Remember that press conference?

1002
01:44:54,860 --> 01:44:57,135
Where he put his arm
around you and said...

1003
01:44:57,380 --> 01:45:01,089
...if Christy hadn't been sick,
she'd have been in Barbados with you?

1004
01:45:01,300 --> 01:45:03,530
How the hell did he know
she was sick?

1005
01:45:04,340 --> 01:45:05,932
You didn't tell anyone.

1006
01:45:06,180 --> 01:45:08,296
It's because she told him that night.

1007
01:45:08,540 --> 01:45:10,531
I was right there watching.

1008
01:45:11,780 --> 01:45:13,691
That's not real proof.

1009
01:45:15,900 --> 01:45:17,458
Well, maybe this is, then.

1010
01:45:23,340 --> 01:45:24,853
You could've stolen this.

1011
01:45:26,260 --> 01:45:27,534
I did steal it.

1012
01:45:27,780 --> 01:45:31,090
But that's not my blood on there
and that's not my prints.

1013
01:45:57,620 --> 01:45:59,292
Mr. Sullivan.

1014
01:46:14,460 --> 01:46:16,928
I did love her, you know.

1015
01:46:36,900 --> 01:46:38,697
Jeez, Burton.

1016
01:47:23,380 --> 01:47:27,089
Is he working late? I don't have
an appointment but I want to see him.

1017
01:47:27,340 --> 01:47:29,490
You don't need an appointment.

1018
01:47:41,980 --> 01:47:43,254
Let's go, Miss Russell.

1019
01:48:24,180 --> 01:48:25,499
Walter.

1020
01:48:25,780 --> 01:48:26,576
Come in.

1021
01:48:30,740 --> 01:48:33,129
<i>We interrupt with a breaking story...</i>

1022
01:48:33,380 --> 01:48:35,530
<i>... that's shocking</i>
<i>the nation and the world.</i>

1023
01:48:35,780 --> 01:48:40,092
<i>Information just came from the White</i>
<i>House about a tragedy within the hour.</i>

1024
01:48:40,300 --> 01:48:42,131
<i>We go now to our correspondent.</i>

1025
01:48:42,380 --> 01:48:44,132
<i>Diane, what can you tell us?</i>

1026
01:48:46,060 --> 01:48:50,895
<i>Sources tell us Walter Sullivan</i>
<i>had seen President Richmond tonight.</i>

1027
01:48:51,100 --> 01:48:54,092
<i>That was for an unscheduled</i>
<i>private meeting.</i>

1028
01:49:04,140 --> 01:49:05,892
You're still here.

1029
01:49:08,780 --> 01:49:10,054
I'm still here.

1030
01:49:19,900 --> 01:49:21,891
<i>- I would not be President.</i>

1031
01:49:23,380 --> 01:49:26,292
<i>If Christine had not taken ill...</i>

1032
01:49:26,940 --> 01:49:29,500
<i>... she would be with you</i>
<i>in Barbados even now.</i>

1033
01:49:33,060 --> 01:49:35,733
<i>Walter, you've been</i>
<i>like a father to me.</i>

1034
01:49:35,980 --> 01:49:38,448
<i>This is the President's</i>
<i>most recent news conference...</i>

1035
01:49:38,660 --> 01:49:40,412
<i>... where he clearly outlined...</i>

1036
01:49:40,620 --> 01:49:43,293
<i>... his loyalty to philanthropist</i>
<i>and friend, Sullivan.</i>

1037
01:49:43,500 --> 01:49:46,492
<i>The President vowed to find</i>
<i>Sullivan 's wife's killer.</i>

1038
01:49:46,740 --> 01:49:50,699
<i>Sullivan had a meeting with the</i>
<i>President.</i> U<i>nknown what they discussed.</i>

1039
01:49:50,940 --> 01:49:53,215
<i>Now to the White House</i>
<i>for a live interview.</i>

1040
01:49:53,660 --> 01:49:57,619
<i>Have you no idea why the President</i>
<i>would take his own life?</i>

1041
01:49:58,540 --> 01:50:03,091
<i>I know he's been feeling the pressure</i>
<i>of office, more than ever, lately.</i>

1042
01:50:03,580 --> 01:50:05,536
<i>He talked about it a great deal.</i>

1043
01:50:05,780 --> 01:50:07,736
<i>But why would he stab himself?</i>

1044
01:50:11,220 --> 01:50:13,893
<i>That's a question that will</i>
<i>haunt me forever.</i>

1045
01:50:16,780 --> 01:50:19,738
<i>Of course I tried to stop him.</i>

1046
01:50:21,460 --> 01:50:22,529
<i>Alan...</i>

1047
01:50:22,780 --> 01:50:24,498
<i>... was like a son to me.</i>

1048
01:51:07,180 --> 01:51:08,898
Was that Seth?

1049
01:51:11,940 --> 01:51:15,250
I think he'd like to come over
for supper when you get well.

1050
01:51:21,900 --> 01:51:23,697
You don't have to fuss.

1051
01:51:23,900 --> 01:51:25,094
I know.

1052
01:51:31,140 --> 01:51:32,732
Am I gonna be all right?

1053
01:51:34,260 --> 01:51:35,488
Yeah.

1054
01:51:36,580 --> 01:51:38,616
We're gonna be just fine.

1055
01:56:10,140 --> 01:56:11,129
