(DJ) Whoo, yeah!

3
00:00:27,947 --> 00:00:31,534
That's about it for this Independence Day

4
00:00:31,618 --> 00:00:36,456
as the clock rocks 12,
ladies and gentlemen, on July 5th, 1996.

5
00:00:36,539 --> 00:00:41,711
And do you know, fellow Americans,
we are now 220 years old.

6
00:00:41,794 --> 00:00:45,381
We've just about, of course,
wiped out the ozone layer.

7
00:00:45,465 --> 00:00:49,385
We live under a continual smog alert
and there's a new drug.

8
00:00:49,469 --> 00:00:52,388
I don't know if you heard this.
Check this out.

9
00:00:52,472 --> 00:00:57,894
There's a new drug for the kids to bury
themselves with called Crystal Dream.

10
00:00:57,977 --> 00:01:01,647
Can you believe it?
You don't drink it. You don't smoke it.

11
00:01:01,731 --> 00:01:06,152
You don't snort it. You don't shoot it.
What do you do, I know you're asking?

12
00:01:06,194 --> 00:01:11,073
What you do is you put it in your eyes
and apparently it tells you lies.

13
00:01:11,157 --> 00:01:15,912
All this decadence and we still haven't
nuked ourselves outta here. Amazing!

14
00:01:15,995 --> 00:01:21,250
With a little luck I think maybe the human
race might live to see another 220 years.

15
00:01:21,334 --> 00:01:25,421
And with that in mind,
happy birthday, America!

It seems we're wasting away

21

23
00:02:24,730 --> 00:02:27,649

Sometimes it's not for days

The people I meet

34
00:03:12,944 --> 00:03:16,114
Always go their separate ways

35
00:03:16,448 --> 00:03:19,117
Sometimes you tell the day

36
00:03:19,534 --> 00:03:22,454
By the bottle that you drink

37
00:03:23,038 --> 00:03:25,957
And time when you're all alone

clean, filtered fresh air and...

it just takes a couple

My old man used to tell me,
before he left this shitty world,

69
00:06:53,746 --> 00:06:58,084
there are five rules
when shooting a game of pool for cash.

70
00:06:58,668 --> 00:07:01,004
Lesson number one.

71
00:07:01,087 --> 00:07:04,757
Always shoot
with a cigarette hangin' in your mouth.

72
00:07:04,841 --> 00:07:07,844
Can't smoke with no fire, asshole.

73
00:07:09,345 --> 00:07:11,431
I quit.

74
00:07:13,266 --> 00:07:15,435
Lesson two.

75
00:07:15,518 --> 00:07:19,355
Always know the table before you shoot.

76
00:07:25,111 --> 00:07:27,280
Lesson number three.

77
00:07:28,281 --> 00:07:33,452
Make sure you chalk that stick real good
before each shot.

78
00:07:39,625 --> 00:07:41,711
Lesson four.

79
00:07:41,794 --> 00:07:47,633
Never make a bet...
if you can't pay the debt.

80
00:07:59,061 --> 00:08:01,146
Lesson number five.

81
00:08:04,316 --> 00:08:06,402
If you lose,

82
00:08:07,903 --> 00:08:10,656
stand up straight and tall -

83
00:08:13,492 --> 00:08:16,829
that corner - and walk like a man.

84

88
00:08:53,281 --> 00:08:59,371
soon as I got five big bills in my pocket,
or your woman in my bed.

89
00:09:10,048 --> 00:09:13,301
I ain't got no $500, cowboy.

Pretty boy.

97

Hey, if he's such a pretty boy, you should
be able to handle him all by yourself.

You ain't gonna meet God with me.

00:16:13,885 --> 00:16:19,140
To fool the whole town may be smart

163
00:16:21,059 --> 00:16:25,396
I'll tell them you'll soon be back, dear

164
00:16:26,898 --> 00:16:32,487
But what can I tell my heart?

165
00:16:33,488 --> 00:16:36,991
Hey, old man, half-time's over.
You got a restaurant to run.

166
00:16:37,074 --> 00:16:40,244
Man alive, Harley.

167
00:16:40,328 --> 00:16:42,413
So good to see you.

168
00:16:44,081 --> 00:16:47,084
I'm gonna regret it. I always do.

169
00:16:49,253 --> 00:16:51,756
Yeah. Who are the suits?

170
00:16:53,841 --> 00:16:57,428
Go back to wherever it is you ran off to.

171
00:16:57,511 --> 00:17:02,183
I can't do that.
I got some unfinished business.

172
00:17:02,266 --> 00:17:06,187
Some business is better left unfinished.

173
00:17:08,606 --> 00:17:09,940
What an ache

174
00:17:10,024 --> 00:17:13,277
Not this business. I'll see you around.

175
00:17:14,195 --> 00:17:18,115
Then I'll wander home

176
00:17:18,199 --> 00:17:22,119
To a telephone

177
00:17:22,202 --> 00:17:27,207
Oh, that forgot how to ring

178
00:17:27,458 --> 00:17:33,797
I could say you'll soon be back, dear

179
00:17:36,216 --> 00:17:40,804
To fool the whole town may be smart

180
00:17:41,388 --> 00:17:47,811
I could say you'll soon be back, dear

181
00:17:48,228 --> 00:17:54,651
Oh, but what will I tell my heart

182
00:17:59,114 --> 00:18:01,909
You got a death wish?

183
00:18:01,992 --> 00:18:04,870
You better leave that one alone, Harley.

184
00:18:04,911 --> 00:18:07,456
You don't think Jack's still pissed off?

185
00:18:07,581 --> 00:18:10,417
Pissed off at ya? Nah.

186
00:18:12,169 --> 00:18:14,629
He wants to kill ya.

187
00:18:15,839 --> 00:18:17,924
(applause, cheering)

188
00:18:20,844 --> 00:18:22,929
(buzzer)

189
00:18:26,933 --> 00:18:30,187
Hey, what's happening, Jose?

190
00:18:30,270 --> 00:18:32,439
Look what the cat drug in.

191
00:18:33,523 --> 00:18:35,609
Qué pasa, amigo?

192
00:18:36,610 --> 00:18:39,195
How you doing? Good to see you.

193
00:18:42,365 --> 00:18:46,828
He didn't think you were comin' back.
Chompin' at the bit for some action.

194
00:18:46,953 --> 00:18:50,790
Me and you are gonna
rock 'n' roll, brother.

195
00:18:50,874 --> 00:18:53,334
Jimmy and... Jack here?

196
00:18:58,047 --> 00:19:03,303
Said he doesn't think you should go in.
If you do, you're dead.

197
00:19:05,847 --> 00:19:10,727
It's better to be dead and cool
than alive and uncool.

198
00:19:16,649 --> 00:19:19,235
200 on Jack! Place your bets.

199
00:19:20,069 --> 00:19:22,155
200 on Jack.

200
00:19:28,077 --> 00:19:31,789
Well, goddamn.
Does he look like he's gotten bigger?

201
00:19:31,914 --> 00:19:33,249
Maybe a little.

202
00:19:33,374 --> 00:19:38,004
The book is closed!
It is time for the main event.

203
00:19:38,087 --> 00:19:40,256
Get set, gentlemen.

204
00:19:41,841 --> 00:19:45,094
Now, may I ask one thing back here?

205
00:19:45,178 --> 00:19:49,932
And that is two things. Be fair and be cool.

206
00:19:50,057 --> 00:19:51,726
Wrestle!

207
00:19:51,851 --> 00:19:53,686
Come on, Jack! Come on, Jack!

208
00:19:54,186 --> 00:19:56,188
Come on, Jack! Come on, Jack!

209
00:20:03,112 --> 00:20:05,448
Jack! Jack?

210
00:20:06,615 --> 00:20:08,951
Goddamn!

211
00:20:14,540 --> 00:20:16,876
Harley, what are you doin' back here?

212
00:20:16,959 --> 00:20:20,421
- I missed all you guys.
- I'm gonna kill you, Harley.

213
00:20:20,462 --> 00:20:22,506
- Told you.
- Get ready.

214
00:20:22,548 --> 00:20:25,885
Jack, I don't want to fight with you.
We're friends.

215
00:20:25,968 --> 00:20:27,052
Was friends.

216
00:20:27,136 --> 00:20:30,139
- Can't we talk this out?
- Not a chance.

217
00:20:30,222 --> 00:20:33,392
Talk's cheap. And I'm not buyin' any.

218
00:20:37,062 --> 00:20:40,399
Hey, Jimmy,
you wanna help me out here a little?

219
00:20:40,482 --> 00:20:43,235
This is your world, homes.
I'm just livin' in it.

220
00:20:47,489 --> 00:20:52,202
Hurry up, Harley.
It's gonna be bloody but quick.

221
00:20:52,327 --> 00:20:54,413
You hold on.

222
00:20:59,001 --> 00:21:03,422
(Marlboro) How much do you think
we can get for this jacket?

223
00:21:04,464 --> 00:21:06,508
What'd he say?

224
00:21:06,592 --> 00:21:08,427
Vaya con Dios, amigo.

225
00:21:10,262 --> 00:21:12,097
What's that mean?

226
00:21:12,139 --> 00:21:14,224
Go with God.

227
00:21:17,769 --> 00:21:22,858
Now, Jack, you know the last time
we did this I kicked your ass.

228
00:21:22,941 --> 00:21:27,195
That was in high school, Harley,
and Jack had a broken arm.

229
00:21:27,279 --> 00:21:30,031
I'm the one that did it.

230
00:21:30,115 --> 00:21:32,200
You remember, Jack?

231
00:21:48,633 --> 00:21:49,843
Goddamnit!

232
00:21:51,803 --> 00:21:54,973
He was doin' pretty good up to there.

233
00:21:59,394 --> 00:22:00,311
Oh...

234
00:22:03,565 --> 00:22:05,650
I can't watch this.

235
00:22:10,530 --> 00:22:12,240
Uh-oh.

236
00:22:12,323 --> 00:22:14,409
He's fucked.

237
00:22:17,161 --> 00:22:19,414
I'm gonna kill you, Harley.

238
00:22:30,091 --> 00:22:32,760
I just picked the wrong flower.

239
00:22:32,844 --> 00:22:37,432
I'd kill for you, Harley.
How could you do that to me?

240
00:22:37,515 --> 00:22:41,811
I've always been bad company with
a good-Iooking woman in the room.

241
00:22:41,936 --> 00:22:44,272
Stay away from her, Harley.

242
00:22:44,355 --> 00:22:46,941
I love her. We're married.

243
00:22:49,694 --> 00:22:52,780
It's always only been you, Jack.

244
00:22:52,864 --> 00:22:55,199
She loves you.

245
00:22:55,283 --> 00:22:57,868
- She does?
- Just you.

246
00:22:57,952 --> 00:23:00,538
- Never you?
- No. Just you.

247
00:23:02,039 --> 00:23:04,625
Sorry, buddy. Sorry.

248
00:23:04,959 --> 00:23:08,963
I should've never let you
in the door, Harley.

249
00:23:09,046 --> 00:23:10,214
Thanks, man.

250
00:23:10,381 --> 00:23:11,966
Never. Never.

251
00:23:12,883 --> 00:23:14,969
- Never.
- Sorry.

252
00:23:16,554 --> 00:23:19,140
Goddamnit, Jack!

253
00:23:19,223 --> 00:23:21,725
You're my brother-in-law and I love you,

254
00:23:21,809 --> 00:23:25,646
but that don't get back
the couple of grand we lost tonight.

255
00:23:25,729 --> 00:23:28,649
The deal is you lose,

256
00:23:28,732 --> 00:23:31,735
and don't tear his fuckin' arm off.

257
00:23:31,819 --> 00:23:34,238
The old man and I have enough problems.

258
00:23:34,321 --> 00:23:38,242
We're tryin' to make as much money
as we can before we lose this place.

259
00:23:38,325 --> 00:23:42,997
What do you mean, lose this place?
You ain't gonna lose this place.

260
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:46,250
- It's a landmark.
- That don't mean shit, homes.

261
00:23:46,333 --> 00:23:49,169
If money talks
and bullshit walks, we walkin'.

262
00:23:49,253 --> 00:23:51,839
And it ain't gonna be down easy street.

263
00:23:51,922 --> 00:23:53,507
What's the story, old man?

264
00:23:53,590 --> 00:24:00,931
In '56 I leased this property when nobody
wanted to be seen on this side of the hill.

265
00:24:01,014 --> 00:24:06,687
And in '66 I renewed my lease
on my own terms.

266
00:24:08,105 --> 00:24:10,941
350 a month for 30 years.

267
00:24:12,276 --> 00:24:15,862
In 21 days those 30 years have run out.

268
00:24:15,946 --> 00:24:19,032
Now with the whole world
flyin' into Burbank,

269
00:24:19,116 --> 00:24:25,372
they're tryin' to strong-arm us
for $2.5 million for a five-year lease.

270
00:24:26,540 --> 00:24:30,127
They're gonna put up another skyscraper.

271
00:24:34,381 --> 00:24:38,218
- Who's tryin' to strong-arm you?
- The bank.

272
00:24:40,220 --> 00:24:43,723
- What bank?
- Great Trust.

273
00:24:47,477 --> 00:24:51,231
- The suits?
- Hm-hmm.

274
00:24:53,566 --> 00:24:55,402
Well...

275
00:24:55,485 --> 00:25:00,407
there's only one place
to get that kind of money so fast.

276
00:25:00,490 --> 00:25:04,828
- No suit's gonna loan us $2.5 million.
- (old man) That's for sure.

277
00:25:04,911 --> 00:25:07,914
Man, I ain't talkin' about no loan.

278
00:25:11,167 --> 00:25:14,671
- I don't wanna hear it, Harley.
- Hear what?

279
00:25:14,754 --> 00:25:18,007
- You don't wanna know.
- Know what?

280
00:25:18,091 --> 00:25:20,927
He's gonna say we should rob the bank.

281
00:25:21,010 --> 00:25:25,515
We ain't gonna rob any damn bank.
We ain't bank robbers.

282
00:25:25,598 --> 00:25:29,269
We owe it to the old man.
We grew up in this place.

283
00:25:29,352 --> 00:25:31,771
You boys don't owe me anything.

284
00:25:32,438 --> 00:25:34,357
(Harley) Sure, we do.

285
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:38,695
Hell, if it wasn't for you,
we'd all be face-down in the gutter

286
00:25:38,778 --> 00:25:42,698
with a cigarette for company and a...

287
00:25:42,782 --> 00:25:45,284
a needle for good times.

288
00:25:49,038 --> 00:25:51,541
I'm ready to go.

289
00:25:51,624 --> 00:25:54,126
- OK, baby. In a minute.
- Now!

290
00:25:59,966 --> 00:26:04,887
Count me out of this one.
I made a promise to Lulu.

291
00:26:07,056 --> 00:26:09,308
You made me a lot of promises, Jack.

292
00:26:09,392 --> 00:26:12,645
We were gonna have a baby someday.

293
00:26:12,728 --> 00:26:16,065
Can't start a family from behind bars.

294
00:26:20,403 --> 00:26:24,824
You know... I really love this place.

295
00:26:25,658 --> 00:26:28,828
It's a home. Makes me feel good.

296
00:26:28,911 --> 00:26:33,499
And if we gotta rob a bank to save it,

297
00:26:34,667 --> 00:26:37,169
I'll do that.

298
00:26:37,253 --> 00:26:39,338
But I can't do it alone.

299
00:26:39,421 --> 00:26:43,259
You guys are gonna have to get it up too.

300
00:27:52,577 --> 00:27:56,581
(radio) 12 minutes Pacific and California.
We'll check with you then. Over.

301
00:27:56,665 --> 00:27:57,749
Roger, Dispatch.

302
00:28:02,754 --> 00:28:04,255
We copy.

303
00:28:08,927 --> 00:28:10,011
Shit!

304
00:28:54,722 --> 00:28:59,644
Car 3, this is Dispatch. Give me
your 10-20 and security code, over.

305
00:28:59,727 --> 00:29:02,647
Dispatch, we're at the shipyard.

306
00:29:05,566 --> 00:29:08,069
What's with this hard-hat?

307
00:29:08,653 --> 00:29:10,655
(horn)

308
00:29:20,581 --> 00:29:24,335
You'll have to move your equipment.
I got a delivery to make.

309
00:29:24,418 --> 00:29:28,005
Are you deaf?
I said you'll have to move your...

310
00:29:28,089 --> 00:29:30,091
I heard what you said.

311
00:29:31,759 --> 00:29:34,011
Drop your gun.

312
00:29:34,094 --> 00:29:36,347
You won't like what you're getting into.

313
00:29:36,430 --> 00:29:40,100
(Harley) From 15 feet away
there's a chance you could miss me.

314
00:29:40,184 --> 00:29:43,604
I could be blind and
still blow your head off, so drop it.

315
00:29:43,687 --> 00:29:45,773
No, you drop it, asshole.

316
00:29:48,359 --> 00:29:50,444
- Shit!
- Think fast.

317
00:29:56,033 --> 00:29:57,201
Shit!

318
00:29:58,619 --> 00:30:01,455
Come on. Get over here. Sit down.

319
00:30:03,957 --> 00:30:07,044
Guns are made to be shot, Harley,
not thrown.

320
00:30:07,961 --> 00:30:10,547
(Harley) Go do it, Jose.

321
00:30:10,631 --> 00:30:14,218
You're the deadest shot I've ever seen.
Where'd you learn to do that?

322
00:30:14,301 --> 00:30:16,720
Read a book. Came with the gun.

323
00:30:16,803 --> 00:30:18,722
Who are you guys?

324
00:30:18,805 --> 00:30:23,227
He's Harley Davidson
and I'm the Marlboro man.

325
00:30:23,310 --> 00:30:27,064
You look like a bunch
of two-bit hoods to me.

326
00:30:32,986 --> 00:30:35,822
Does that look like the work
of two-bit hoods?

327
00:30:35,906 --> 00:30:38,992
Yeah. Pros would have used my keys.

328
00:30:40,744 --> 00:30:42,913
He likes to blow things up.

329
00:30:43,914 --> 00:30:45,582
Hot stuff. Watch it.

330
00:30:45,665 --> 00:30:50,670
- Nice day for work, huh, Jimmy?
- None better ever, homes.

331
00:30:58,595 --> 00:31:00,847
Nice doing business with you boys.

332
00:31:00,931 --> 00:31:05,018
Your business isn't with us. It's with them.

333
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:27,373
Whatever they've got to say,
I don't wanna hear it.

334
00:31:29,375 --> 00:31:31,878
- Let's rock it! We got company.
- Shit, no.

335
00:31:34,297 --> 00:31:35,215
Shit!

336
00:31:40,970 --> 00:31:43,389
What the fuck is all this about?

337
00:31:50,980 --> 00:31:55,068
Harley, throw that shotgun at 'em.
Maybe you'll hit somethin'.

338
00:32:02,825 --> 00:32:05,745
- I thought you was a dead shot.
- So did I.

339
00:32:05,828 --> 00:32:09,582
- Then why ain't they droppin'?
- Beats the shit outta me.

340
00:32:15,421 --> 00:32:17,340
(yelling)

341
00:32:34,690 --> 00:32:35,941
Come on, guys.

342
00:32:46,702 --> 00:32:49,788
- Come on, Harley!
- Let's go, Jimmy!

343
00:33:25,073 --> 00:33:29,328
(Jimmy) All right, you're a big fuckin'
hero, big man! A big fuckin' hero!

344
00:33:29,411 --> 00:33:32,998
You guys needed backup. I had
nothing to do and no one to do it with.

345
00:33:33,081 --> 00:33:37,669
Backup, hell. Harley's thinking
damn near had us on the ropes.

346
00:33:37,753 --> 00:33:39,588
Saved our lives, big boy.

347
00:33:39,671 --> 00:33:43,008
You guys owe me a bike.
I gotta get a new bike.

348
00:33:43,091 --> 00:33:45,093
Hey, man, you'll get a new bike.

349
00:33:45,177 --> 00:33:49,765
Promise you won't tell Lulu. I don't want
her mad. She's mean when she's mad.

350
00:33:49,848 --> 00:33:53,768
I can take care of the bike,
but I can't take care of the bitch.

351
00:33:53,852 --> 00:33:58,190
- Why not? You did once.
- You might wanna take a look at this shit.

352
00:34:04,362 --> 00:34:07,032
- What is it?
- Unmelted, pure Crystal Dream.

353
00:34:07,115 --> 00:34:10,201
What the fuck is that
and what is it doin' here?

354
00:34:10,285 --> 00:34:14,956
It's a drug. And I don't know
what the fuck it's doin' here.

355
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:18,960
I'm a son of a bitch.
We jumped the wrong train.

356
00:34:19,044 --> 00:34:20,962
Fuck! Shit, man!

357
00:34:22,213 --> 00:34:25,717
His little brother OD'd using this shit.

358
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:29,053
Don't worry, Jose, we ain't drug dealers.

359
00:34:32,557 --> 00:34:36,561
This is not a walk in the park, Harley.
This is way out there on the edge.

360
00:34:36,644 --> 00:34:40,732
These guys are killers. They killed
their own men tryin' to waste us.

361
00:34:40,815 --> 00:34:43,234
That's enough, Jimmy.

362
00:34:43,318 --> 00:34:46,571
I never liked this plan from the start.

363
00:34:46,654 --> 00:34:48,990
But you needed help and you took it.

364
00:34:49,073 --> 00:34:52,327
So don't whine about it now.

365
00:34:52,410 --> 00:34:55,163
What's done is done.
There's no turnin' back.

366
00:34:58,166 --> 00:34:59,917
Who are these men?

367
00:35:00,001 --> 00:35:03,671
Judging from the data we gathered,
they're dilettantes.

368
00:35:03,755 --> 00:35:10,344
Details would suggest that they were
not aware of the cargo they've stolen.

369
00:35:17,768 --> 00:35:22,857
If they're amateurs,
how'd they destroy two vehicles

370
00:35:22,940 --> 00:35:26,944
and then manage to get away
with the goods?

371
00:35:28,612 --> 00:35:31,115
They were extremely lucky.

372
00:35:34,869 --> 00:35:39,540
I don't have time for luck, now, do I?

373
00:35:40,207 --> 00:35:42,626
Get back what's mine.

374
00:35:43,544 --> 00:35:47,047
And kill these men, Alexander, OK?

375
00:35:53,470 --> 00:35:54,972
Yeah, yeah, yeah

376
00:36:03,355 --> 00:36:05,816
Man, we really fucked up big.

377
00:36:08,986 --> 00:36:14,992
How was I supposed to know somebody's
using a bank as a front to run drugs?

378
00:36:15,993 --> 00:36:18,996
Harley, I'm tired and I'm pissed.

379
00:36:20,581 --> 00:36:23,083
And I'd just like to unwind.

380
00:36:24,459 --> 00:36:26,587
So stop thinkin'.

381
00:36:26,670 --> 00:36:30,257
Now I gotta think of some way
to make things right.

382
00:36:34,344 --> 00:36:36,430
Hi.

383
00:36:36,513 --> 00:36:40,017
I know you don't know me,
but I don't have a way home

384
00:36:40,100 --> 00:36:43,520
and Jimmy said that you'd give me a ride.

385
00:36:44,938 --> 00:36:47,649
Sure, I'll give you a ride, Sally.

386
00:36:47,691 --> 00:36:49,860
The name tag's wrong.

387
00:36:49,985 --> 00:36:52,070
My real name's Honey.

388
00:36:53,530 --> 00:36:57,367
Pure gold... and sweet.

389
00:36:59,536 --> 00:37:01,621
I'm off at ten.

390
00:37:03,290 --> 00:37:08,378
My old man used to tell me,
before he left this shitty world,

391
00:37:08,461 --> 00:37:11,965
the right woman can make you
and the wrong one can break you.

392
00:37:12,048 --> 00:37:14,551
I woke up one mornin'...

393
00:37:17,053 --> 00:37:19,139
and she was gone.

394
00:37:21,308 --> 00:37:24,227
No note. No kiss goodbye. No nothin'.

395
00:37:24,310 --> 00:37:28,314
And I still have feelings
for her deep inside.

396
00:37:29,482 --> 00:37:36,156
Partner, I only know of two cures
for that particular ailment.

397
00:37:36,906 --> 00:37:41,619
And since you don't drink any more,
you're down to one.

398
00:37:43,496 --> 00:37:45,915
Let me borrow your bike.

399
00:37:46,040 --> 00:37:48,126
I gotta take Sally home.

400
00:37:48,167 --> 00:37:49,836
Get a cab.

401
00:38:06,644 --> 00:38:07,687
(siren)

402
00:39:04,577 --> 00:39:08,414
Stand up and put your hands
behind your head.

403
00:39:10,249 --> 00:39:12,751
I was just blowin' off a little steam.

404
00:39:12,835 --> 00:39:17,673
You blew in the wrong place.
Kiss the wall and spread 'em.

405
00:39:37,359 --> 00:39:40,362
OK, cowboy, let's blow off some steam.

406
00:39:46,034 --> 00:39:48,120
What's wrong tonight?

407
00:39:49,955 --> 00:39:52,040
I'm getting married.

408
00:39:54,292 --> 00:39:56,920
Goddamn you, Robert,
I'm tired of waiting

409
00:39:57,045 --> 00:39:59,756
for you to come by
when you feel the need.

410
00:39:59,881 --> 00:40:04,719
I get Ionely. I like to share my bed
with someone at night.

411
00:40:10,725 --> 00:40:13,728
Hell, isn't that what we're doin'?

412
00:40:14,646 --> 00:40:17,399
One, maybe two nights a month,
if I'm lucky.

413
00:40:18,817 --> 00:40:21,152
Well, I am what I am, Virginia.

414
00:40:21,236 --> 00:40:26,116
I've accepted that, even loved it.
But I don't have to like it.

415
00:40:28,827 --> 00:40:31,663
I get scared for you. I worry.

416
00:40:31,746 --> 00:40:36,793
You could spend the rest of your life
looking for what it is you're looking for,

417
00:40:36,835 --> 00:40:39,671
but someday you'll have to find yourself.

418
00:40:39,754 --> 00:40:43,424
I just can't wait for you to do it any more.

419
00:40:46,845 --> 00:40:48,930
I love you, Robert.

420
00:40:50,848 --> 00:40:55,436
But after tonight,
you're not welcome here any more.

421
00:41:13,204 --> 00:41:14,831
(rock music on radio)

422
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:39,230
Oh, fuck!

423
00:41:41,565 --> 00:41:46,404
That's for Marlboro. Me and you'll
go out and have somethin' to eat.

424
00:41:46,487 --> 00:41:48,322
You're a bad man, Harley.

425
00:41:51,992 --> 00:41:54,912
(Virginia)
What are you two up to this time?

426
00:41:57,998 --> 00:42:02,545
Do you know anything
about this new drug, Crystal Dream?

427
00:42:03,921 --> 00:42:07,841
It's 100% addictive and kills
one out of every seven users.

428
00:42:07,925 --> 00:42:09,176
Don't mess with it.

429
00:42:09,260 --> 00:42:13,222
I don't mess with drugs no more,
you know that.

430
00:42:15,683 --> 00:42:20,688
It's a liquid-based blue crystalline
substance with a neurotoxin RAH,

431
00:42:20,771 --> 00:42:24,108
retina-activating hallucinogen.

432
00:42:24,191 --> 00:42:29,113
So, it sort of numbs the senses
and makes the world look better?

433
00:42:29,154 --> 00:42:30,364
That's the high.

434
00:42:30,447 --> 00:42:34,785
The low is it damages the central nervous
system, causes insanity, then death.

435
00:42:34,868 --> 00:42:37,120
On the street it's called the dream.

436
00:42:37,204 --> 00:42:39,289
Thank you.

437
00:42:46,338 --> 00:42:48,423
I'm broke.

438
00:43:03,230 --> 00:43:08,819
You know something, Harley?
In a weird way I'm jealous of you two.

439
00:43:10,570 --> 00:43:12,656
Why's that?

440
00:43:12,739 --> 00:43:18,411
The rest of us work so damn hard at life
and you guys just live it one day at a time.

441
00:43:18,495 --> 00:43:19,704
Yeah.

442
00:43:23,667 --> 00:43:25,752
See ya.

443
00:43:46,606 --> 00:43:49,442
What's with you and the old boots?

444
00:43:49,526 --> 00:43:53,696
Lay off my boots, Harley.
I'm in no fuckin' mood.

445
00:43:55,281 --> 00:43:58,284
Did you have a rough night?

446
00:43:58,368 --> 00:44:01,537
I woke up smellin' the coffee.
Give me a light.

447
00:44:01,663 --> 00:44:05,083
- I thought you quit?
- Just give me a light.

448
00:44:15,802 --> 00:44:18,304
- Whose bike?
- Probably hers.

449
00:44:19,639 --> 00:44:21,724
She ain't got no Harley.

450
00:44:27,647 --> 00:44:29,148
What are you doin'?

451
00:44:29,232 --> 00:44:33,069
It ain't hers,
but I'll bet I know whose it is.

452
00:44:33,903 --> 00:44:36,489
- Whose?
- It's his.

453
00:44:38,241 --> 00:44:41,160
You gotta cross and cut
the red and the green wire.

454
00:44:41,243 --> 00:44:47,541
I know how to hot-wire a bike. Don't
tell me how to hot-wire a goddamn bike.

455
00:44:49,752 --> 00:44:52,421
You gotta turn on the gas.

456
00:44:56,425 --> 00:44:57,843
(bike starts)

457
00:44:59,678 --> 00:45:03,849
If he's gonna take my girl,
I'm gonna take his bike.

458
00:45:22,993 --> 00:45:26,789
- You sure this is the right bank?
- Yeah, I'm sure.

459
00:45:26,872 --> 00:45:30,709
- How sure?
- Hey, man, I'm real sure.

460
00:45:30,793 --> 00:45:35,297
You were real sure there was gonna be
money on that armoured truck.

461
00:45:35,380 --> 00:45:38,717
And you were real sure
this plan was gonna work.

462
00:45:38,801 --> 00:45:43,805
You better be right about this or I'll break
your head so you can't think no more.

463
00:45:43,889 --> 00:45:48,060
Lighten up and tell me
about that guy that's workin' Virginia.

464
00:45:48,143 --> 00:45:49,895
Don't care. Didn't ask.

465
00:45:52,481 --> 00:45:57,152
- You're gonna let her go just like that?
- From where I stand, she let me go.

466
00:45:57,235 --> 00:46:00,739
(Harley) If she wants you to chase her,
that's the game.

467
00:46:00,822 --> 00:46:04,242
My old man used to tell me,
before he left this shitty world,

468
00:46:04,326 --> 00:46:06,495
never chase buses or women.

469
00:46:06,578 --> 00:46:09,081
You always get left behind.

470
00:46:25,013 --> 00:46:28,016
I assume you're here to do business?

471
00:46:28,099 --> 00:46:31,436
I'd like to do some business with you
some other time.

472
00:46:31,519 --> 00:46:34,522
But right now we got to talk
to the man upstairs.

473
00:46:34,606 --> 00:46:36,691
Stay on my tail.

474
00:46:41,196 --> 00:46:43,531
No problem.

475
00:46:56,127 --> 00:47:00,381
Looks like we really
rattled the cage, Marlboro.

476
00:47:06,971 --> 00:47:10,975
- This ain't gonna fly.
- I'll bet you it flies.

477
00:47:13,728 --> 00:47:16,481
- How much?
- I'll bet you a dollar.

478
00:47:17,482 --> 00:47:24,072
If you win you'll have to give me credit
cos that cab fare last night broke me.

479
00:47:25,907 --> 00:47:27,992
If I win, we're dead.

480
00:47:29,994 --> 00:47:31,162
(phone rings)

481
00:47:31,245 --> 00:47:34,999
Strap on your seat belt
and get ready to fly.

482
00:47:36,918 --> 00:47:38,419
American Airlines.

483
00:47:38,502 --> 00:47:42,506
You've got something of mine
and I want it back.

484
00:47:42,590 --> 00:47:45,426
Really? What is that?

485
00:47:45,927 --> 00:47:51,098
You know something,
you've got balls. Big ones.

486
00:47:52,016 --> 00:47:54,769
But they're not as big as you might think.

487
00:47:54,852 --> 00:48:00,024
Well, mister, my balls are big enough
to get your attention.

488
00:48:09,533 --> 00:48:13,787
- What do you want?
- How's about $2.5 million?

489
00:48:15,122 --> 00:48:18,542
Wait a minute. Check that.
I got a little side bet goin'.

490
00:48:18,626 --> 00:48:22,212
Make that $2.5 million plus a buck.

491
00:48:22,713 --> 00:48:24,632
When?

492
00:48:24,715 --> 00:48:25,883
Where?

493
00:48:26,717 --> 00:48:29,303
Airplane graveyard,

494
00:48:30,387 --> 00:48:32,890
late, tonight.

495
00:48:34,391 --> 00:48:39,229
You better call your boys off
or you ain't gonna get nothin'.

496
00:48:39,313 --> 00:48:42,399
Talk to you on the rebound... asshole.

497
00:48:50,324 --> 00:48:51,325
Yes, sir?

498
00:48:51,408 --> 00:48:53,994
Let 'em go, Alexander.

499
00:48:54,995 --> 00:48:57,080
Let 'em go.

500
00:48:58,415 --> 00:49:01,084
(helicopter overhead)

501
00:49:17,517 --> 00:49:19,603
OK, let's do it.

502
00:49:42,125 --> 00:49:45,545
You boys are good... for dilettantes.

503
00:49:45,628 --> 00:49:48,798
They're not my boys, they're my friends.

504
00:49:48,882 --> 00:49:51,634
Yeah. Let's see the crystals.

505
00:49:52,302 --> 00:49:55,054
Let's see the cash.

506
00:49:55,138 --> 00:49:55,805
Hey.

507
00:49:55,889 --> 00:49:57,974
Open it real slow.

508
00:50:08,651 --> 00:50:12,155
- Why the extra dollar?
- We had a bet.

509
00:50:15,575 --> 00:50:16,242
OK.

510
00:50:37,346 --> 00:50:41,934
Well, it wasn't a walk in the park,
but the job's done.

511
00:50:47,940 --> 00:50:51,694
You did it. You did it, man.

512
00:50:51,777 --> 00:50:53,863
Check this out, old man.

513
00:50:56,699 --> 00:50:59,869
Besides Jimmy and Lulu
and the rest of you,

514
00:50:59,952 --> 00:51:03,622
this place is what keeps me
comin' back day after day.

515
00:51:04,206 --> 00:51:08,210
Thank you for givin' that back to me.

516
00:51:08,294 --> 00:51:10,212
I've got things to do.

517
00:51:10,296 --> 00:51:15,384
- Tomorrow we open for good.
- All right. All right, Pops.

518
00:51:15,468 --> 00:51:16,969
Whoo!

519
00:51:17,052 --> 00:51:20,055
Man, I am thankful for this.

520
00:51:20,139 --> 00:51:23,225
But you boys are whacked out,
you know that?

521
00:51:23,309 --> 00:51:26,061
I'm talkin' about you, Harley.

522
00:51:27,730 --> 00:51:31,150
- That's what friendship's about.
- It's done and it's done good.

523
00:51:31,233 --> 00:51:35,321
So let's take the edge off.
Come here, Marlboro, get in this.

524
00:51:36,322 --> 00:51:39,074
To Lulu, who'd kill me
if she knew what I helped do.

525
00:51:39,158 --> 00:51:41,910
But because I did it, she still has a job.

526
00:51:41,994 --> 00:51:44,079
To Lulu.

527
00:51:56,091 --> 00:51:58,177
What's wrong? We done good tonight.

528
00:51:58,260 --> 00:52:02,264
Shit, Harley,
we're way out of our league, man.

529
00:52:03,682 --> 00:52:06,184
It was too easy.

530
00:52:06,268 --> 00:52:10,439
I think we oughta get out of Dodge,
let things cool off for a while.

531
00:52:10,522 --> 00:52:13,108
(Marlboro) Look at this shit.

532
00:52:21,116 --> 00:52:25,287
- How the fuck did they find us?
- I don't know.

533
00:52:25,370 --> 00:52:27,956
And I damn sure don't wanna find out.

534
00:52:32,294 --> 00:52:36,548
Not this again.
I can't deal with this again, Harley.

535
00:52:36,631 --> 00:52:39,634
The old man's got it under control.

536
00:52:41,636 --> 00:52:44,806
Yeah, tell them we were in but we left.

537
00:52:47,392 --> 00:52:52,897
That's right, boy, take your pussy friends
and get the hell out of here.

538
00:52:52,981 --> 00:52:55,233
Oops. I don't think he liked that.

539
00:52:55,316 --> 00:52:58,153
I don't give a flying fuck what he likes.

540
00:53:36,274 --> 00:53:40,278
- We gotta get the hell outta here.
- No kidding!

541
00:54:02,800 --> 00:54:06,220
I'm gonna fuckin' die today, Harley,
and I blame you.

542
00:54:07,138 --> 00:54:12,143
No, we're gonna live, and we're gonna
go through that window to do it.

543
00:54:13,227 --> 00:54:15,146
Jack, cover me.

544
00:54:29,410 --> 00:54:30,494
Jack, come on!

545
00:54:34,832 --> 00:54:36,834
(Jack) I'm right behind you.

546
00:54:43,590 --> 00:54:45,426
Jack?

547
00:54:46,844 --> 00:54:48,011
Jack?

548
00:56:18,101 --> 00:56:19,769
Uh-oh. Uh-oh.

549
00:56:24,691 --> 00:56:26,025
Sh, sh, sh.

550
00:56:26,109 --> 00:56:28,194
Lady? Lady, hey, hey, hey.

551
00:56:28,278 --> 00:56:30,863
Take it easy. We don't wanna hurt you.

552
00:56:35,368 --> 00:56:37,787
Take her.

553
00:56:45,628 --> 00:56:47,713
"Take her" he says!

554
00:56:49,632 --> 00:56:50,550
Jesus, lady.

555
00:56:56,806 --> 00:56:59,725
Hey! This is a restricted area, man.

556
00:56:59,809 --> 00:57:00,393
Sh, sh.

557
00:57:00,476 --> 00:57:04,146
You're gonna have to scoot,
and I mean fast.

558
00:57:05,481 --> 00:57:10,820
Hey, chump, in case you don't hear
so good, I said get the fuck outta here.

559
00:58:00,452 --> 00:58:03,205
(Marlboro) I hate this fuckin' town.

560
00:58:03,288 --> 00:58:06,959
Hey, man, you don't know
anything about this city.

561
00:58:07,042 --> 00:58:09,878
I grew up here, you dumb bastard.

562
00:58:11,380 --> 00:58:15,634
- I didn't know that.
- What you don't know is a lot.

563
00:58:18,303 --> 00:58:21,390
You mean to tell me that real cowboys,

564
00:58:21,473 --> 00:58:26,395
I mean, shit-kickin' rodeo cowboys,
come from Vegas?

565
00:58:28,230 --> 00:58:30,315
Some of the best.

566
00:58:31,733 --> 00:58:34,236
Maybe even one of the best.

567
00:58:43,245 --> 00:58:46,081
Man, I know you don't wanna be here.

568
00:58:46,164 --> 00:58:50,585
We're just gonna stay long enough
to clean up and get some sleep.

569
00:58:50,669 --> 00:58:53,171
Yeah, OK.

570
00:58:53,255 --> 00:58:59,344
Did I ever tell you the time I lost my cherry
to a fat girl in a room just like this?

571
00:58:59,427 --> 00:59:03,348
It was in Mesquite, Texas.
Her name was Annie.

572
00:59:04,182 --> 00:59:07,185
Wasn't too good puttin' us
up on this top floor.

573
00:59:07,268 --> 00:59:12,107
There was a convention in town.
It was all we could get.

574
00:59:12,190 --> 00:59:15,443
Makes for a tough getaway.

575
00:59:15,527 --> 00:59:18,613
They're not gonna find us here.
They can't.

576
00:59:18,696 --> 00:59:21,199
I wouldn't bet on that.

577
00:59:24,536 --> 00:59:30,124
Why don't you stop whinin'?
You're startin' to sound like Jimmy.

578
00:59:39,384 --> 00:59:42,970
Jimmy's dead, you heartless piece of shit.

579
00:59:49,977 --> 00:59:53,981
Four of our friends got killed tonight.

580
00:59:54,065 --> 00:59:58,152
They're gone.
Fuckin' tagged-on-the-toe dead.

581
00:59:59,320 --> 01:00:01,822
Does that matter to you?

582
01:00:01,906 --> 01:00:04,158
Do you fuckin' care?

583
01:00:05,826 --> 01:00:09,747
Marlboro, I didn't force anyone to do it.

584
01:00:09,830 --> 01:00:13,584
They took the chance
and they knew the risk.

585
01:00:15,753 --> 01:00:18,506
All right, look, it's my fault.

586
01:00:18,589 --> 01:00:21,509
And I gotta live with it.

587
01:00:21,592 --> 01:00:27,681
But right now me and you gotta
pull it together if we're gonna survive.

588
01:00:42,863 --> 01:00:44,949
(phone rings)

589
01:00:46,367 --> 01:00:47,868
Hello.

590
01:00:47,952 --> 01:00:49,286
(Marlboro) Hello.

591
01:00:49,370 --> 01:00:51,455
Hey.

592
01:00:51,538 --> 01:00:53,624
Where are you? Are you all right?

593
01:00:53,707 --> 01:00:56,543
Las Vegas.

594
01:00:56,627 --> 01:01:00,631
I called because I'm drunk and I'm tired.

595
01:01:00,714 --> 01:01:02,800
I just wanted to hear your voice.

596
01:01:03,467 --> 01:01:09,056
Tell me exactly where you are
and what you've done, and I can help.

597
01:01:09,640 --> 01:01:11,725
No. Can't do that.

598
01:01:16,230 --> 01:01:20,400
I've already dug too many graves.
None of them my own.

599
01:01:20,484 --> 01:01:22,653
Robert.

600
01:01:22,736 --> 01:01:26,406
You keep running and sooner or later
you'll end up like your dad.

601
01:01:26,490 --> 01:01:29,993
Drunk, dead and alone.
And all you can do is hold on and wait.

602
01:01:39,753 --> 01:01:41,671
Robert?

603
01:01:41,755 --> 01:01:43,173
Hello?

604
01:01:43,256 --> 01:01:44,341
Are you there?

605
01:01:46,426 --> 01:01:49,429
Harley, let's go. We got company.

606
01:01:49,513 --> 01:01:53,433
- Hey, I know how they found us.
- Tell me later.

607
01:01:59,356 --> 01:02:01,775
Please, God, let us get out of this one.

608
01:02:01,858 --> 01:02:04,027
I promise I'll change.

609
01:02:04,110 --> 01:02:07,781
- That's bullshit, Harley.
- I'll fuckin' try.

610
01:02:07,864 --> 01:02:08,865
(lift bell)

611
01:02:11,534 --> 01:02:12,285
Shit!

612
01:02:17,207 --> 01:02:19,292
Up! They're going up!

613
01:02:47,153 --> 01:02:49,238
Holy shit!

614
01:02:50,323 --> 01:02:51,407
Come on!

615
01:03:06,923 --> 01:03:10,843
We're at death's door, Harley,
and the devil's a-knockin'.

616
01:03:10,927 --> 01:03:16,015
You better think up of somethin' fast
or start your ass prayin' for real.

617
01:03:28,360 --> 01:03:31,197
Put your gun away. We're gonna jump.

618
01:03:43,959 --> 01:03:46,712
Are you out of your fuckin' mind?

619
01:03:48,047 --> 01:03:50,132
You got a better idea?

620
01:04:02,061 --> 01:04:07,483
Whatever the hell they're wearing's
made outta die-hard blue steel, Harley.

621
01:04:07,566 --> 01:04:09,818
All right, take my hand, man.

622
01:04:09,902 --> 01:04:10,736
No!

623
01:04:10,819 --> 01:04:12,738
- It's the only way.
- I don't care.

624
01:04:12,821 --> 01:04:15,908
- I'm gonna do it.
- Do it!

625
01:04:15,991 --> 01:04:19,244
- You'll get shot up here.
- You'll get smashed down there.

626
01:04:19,328 --> 01:04:21,830
- I'd rather be smashed than shot.
- Not me.

627
01:04:23,832 --> 01:04:27,920
All right. Fuck you! You stay up here
and you get shot and die!

628
01:04:28,003 --> 01:04:29,755
I owe you that.

629
01:04:43,935 --> 01:04:48,607
I hate you for this, Harley.
I fuckin' hate you for this.

630
01:04:49,691 --> 01:04:53,612
I hate you, Harley.

631
01:04:53,695 --> 01:04:55,780
Shit!

632
01:04:59,868 --> 01:05:01,953
Was that intense or what?

633
01:05:29,814 --> 01:05:32,317
We gotta go back, Harley.

634
01:05:33,735 --> 01:05:36,654
What the fuck you talkin' about?

635
01:05:37,989 --> 01:05:40,742
We survived. It's over.

636
01:05:43,661 --> 01:05:45,830
It ain't over.

637
01:05:45,913 --> 01:05:49,167
Hey, man, it's definitely over. See this?

638
01:05:52,420 --> 01:05:54,255
It's out of commission.

639
01:05:54,338 --> 01:05:59,343
That means that them fuckers can't keep
comin' out of nowhere any more.

640
01:05:59,427 --> 01:06:04,515
We still got a bunch of money
we didn't get for ourselves,

641
01:06:04,599 --> 01:06:06,934
and a bar full of dead friends in LA.

642
01:06:09,270 --> 01:06:11,355
It ain't over.

643
01:06:12,690 --> 01:06:15,192
This ain't right.

644
01:06:15,276 --> 01:06:18,029
And we owe it to our friends
to make it right.

645
01:06:18,112 --> 01:06:22,033
Hey, man, I ain't makin' any plans
for you and me for a long time.

646
01:06:22,116 --> 01:06:27,621
We came out alive,
we came out ahead, and I ain't doin' it.

647
01:06:27,705 --> 01:06:31,959
Goddamnit, Harley. We ain't ahead.

648
01:06:32,043 --> 01:06:37,131
And if bein' alive means
living on the run, then I don't want it.

649
01:06:38,132 --> 01:06:42,303
Marlboro, you do
what you think is right, right?

650
01:06:42,386 --> 01:06:45,055
I'm gonna stay alive.

651
01:06:53,314 --> 01:06:57,484
Better to be dead and cool
than alive and uncool.

652
01:07:23,010 --> 01:07:25,179
("Hardline" by Waylon Jennings)

653
01:07:25,262 --> 01:07:27,264
(banging on door)

654
01:07:38,859 --> 01:07:41,778
What do you want?

655
01:07:41,862 --> 01:07:43,196
Virginia.

656
01:07:43,280 --> 01:07:46,366
- She's asleep.
- Wake her up.

657
01:07:46,450 --> 01:07:48,535
(arguing)

658
01:08:05,969 --> 01:08:11,725
You've got until we reach the sidewalk
to say what you've got to say.

659
01:08:11,808 --> 01:08:14,978
Mr Trigger-happy a cop too?

660
01:08:15,061 --> 01:08:17,564
He just made lieutenant.

661
01:08:21,317 --> 01:08:23,737
He the guy?

662
01:08:23,820 --> 01:08:26,740
What do you want, Robert?

663
01:08:26,823 --> 01:08:31,077
You want my help? My sympathy?
My hand in marriage? What?

664
01:08:34,330 --> 01:08:36,249
I don't...

665
01:08:38,084 --> 01:08:40,837
I don't know what I want.

666
01:08:41,754 --> 01:08:45,174
But I know what I don't want.

667
01:08:47,510 --> 01:08:51,514
I don't want
whatever there was between us...

668
01:08:54,434 --> 01:08:57,353
to end without telling you...

669
01:08:59,856 --> 01:09:05,278
you've been the better part of my life,
the best part of my life.

670
01:09:12,869 --> 01:09:14,704
Goodbye, Virginia.

671
01:09:17,874 --> 01:09:19,208
Robert?

672
01:09:24,714 --> 01:09:28,134
Fightin' on the front line

673
01:09:28,968 --> 01:09:32,388
Victim of a heart crime

674
01:09:33,389 --> 01:09:39,812
Can't just let you steal my heart away

675
01:09:40,479 --> 01:09:44,066
Sorry I'm late. I had a layover in Denver.

676
01:09:48,654 --> 01:09:52,491
- (Harley) Are you and me friends?
- Sure, we're friends.

677
01:09:53,242 --> 01:09:58,080
Then how come, with all this shit
that me and you have been through,

678
01:09:58,163 --> 01:10:01,250
I've asked you the same question
a thousand times

679
01:10:01,333 --> 01:10:04,086
and you ain't never answered me?

680
01:10:07,089 --> 01:10:09,091
What question?

681
01:10:09,174 --> 01:10:13,262
What's with you and those fuckin' boots?

682
01:10:13,345 --> 01:10:17,015
My old man gave me these boots.

683
01:10:17,099 --> 01:10:21,353
First time I rode in a professional rodeo.

684
01:10:21,437 --> 01:10:24,606
It was the first and last thing
he ever gave me.

685
01:10:24,690 --> 01:10:28,026
Marlboro, you could've told me that.

686
01:10:29,778 --> 01:10:32,614
I kinda figured
it was between him and me.

687
01:10:34,449 --> 01:10:38,120
I got thrown
and busted my arm in four places.

688
01:10:38,203 --> 01:10:41,540
Hey, I think you should do it again.

689
01:10:43,792 --> 01:10:46,878
Someday. Maybe.

690
01:10:56,388 --> 01:11:00,976
- Where the hell did you get that hog leg?
- In Denver.

691
01:11:01,059 --> 01:11:04,479
This is a Ruger Super Blackhawk.

692
01:11:05,981 --> 01:11:07,899
454 conversion.

693
01:11:10,986 --> 01:11:15,657
- Goddamn, that's too much gun for you.
- It's what I learned with.

694
01:11:16,908 --> 01:11:20,203
Nobody learns with a converted 454.

695
01:11:20,996 --> 01:11:21,997
I did.

696
01:11:25,250 --> 01:11:27,335
That explains it.

697
01:11:29,170 --> 01:11:32,632
I've been through a lot of shit in my life.

698
01:11:32,674 --> 01:11:36,302
But up until about three weeks ago,

699
01:11:36,344 --> 01:11:39,597
the only goddamn thing
I ever shot at was tin cans.

700
01:11:41,766 --> 01:11:45,353
I never wanted
to shoot at nobody in anger.

701
01:11:45,436 --> 01:11:50,191
And I sure as shit ain't never
wanted to kill nobody.

702
01:11:51,276 --> 01:11:53,361
Me, neither.

703
01:12:11,379 --> 01:12:13,464
(beeping)

704
01:12:14,549 --> 01:12:19,137
Take up a heading of zero one zero.
They're seven clicks northeast of here.

705
01:12:19,220 --> 01:12:24,809
The same heading my co-pilot shouted
out the day we choppered into Khe Sanh.

706
01:12:24,892 --> 01:12:30,147
- Last thing the ugly bastard ever said.
- Shut the fuck up and fly, Tom.

707
01:12:30,231 --> 01:12:32,149
OK. OK.

708
01:14:46,533 --> 01:14:51,204
God, if you do exist
and you're up there watchin'

709
01:14:51,287 --> 01:14:56,709
from wherever it is you're watchin' from,
just look away for a minute.

710
01:14:57,502 --> 01:15:00,546
(Marlboro) Remember,
these bastards are bulletproof.

711
01:15:00,672 --> 01:15:03,841
So aim for their heads. Dead centre.

712
01:15:04,968 --> 01:15:08,638
You might wanna hold onto
that cannon with both hands.

713
01:15:08,721 --> 01:15:11,974
Don't yank. Don't pull.

714
01:15:12,975 --> 01:15:16,229
Squeeze. You ready?

715
01:15:16,312 --> 01:15:20,817
- Let's rock 'n' roll these motherfuckers.
- Let's make things right.

716
01:15:43,172 --> 01:15:47,259
That gun costs about two bucks
every time you fire it.

717
01:15:47,343 --> 01:15:49,845
That's two bucks a bullet.

718
01:15:50,930 --> 01:15:53,808
How many did I hit?

719
01:15:53,849 --> 01:15:57,103
You spent 12 bucks
and didn't hit a goddamn thing.

720
01:15:57,186 --> 01:15:59,647
I nailed one and it cost four and a quarter.

721
01:15:59,772 --> 01:16:01,273
Where'd they go?

722
01:16:02,775 --> 01:16:05,444
Right there and they're spendin' a fortune.

723
01:16:15,371 --> 01:16:17,623
We really pissed them off this time.

724
01:16:17,706 --> 01:16:20,209
No shit. Come on, let's go.

725
01:16:55,911 --> 01:16:57,329
(clang)

726
01:17:17,766 --> 01:17:18,808
Harley?

727
01:17:20,393 --> 01:17:22,479
Are you shootin'?

728
01:17:24,606 --> 01:17:26,691
- Harley?
- What?

729
01:18:35,176 --> 01:18:38,763
That's two for me.
You better get off your ass, Harley.

730
01:18:38,846 --> 01:18:41,933
Give me a break. God knows I'm tryin'.

731
01:18:42,016 --> 01:18:46,437
You better ask God for some help.
We ain't done yet.

732
01:19:28,312 --> 01:19:30,064
Fuck! Shit! Piss!

733
01:19:30,147 --> 01:19:31,982
Horseshit in a bear's ass!

734
01:19:41,325 --> 01:19:42,576
Two bucks.

735
01:19:45,162 --> 01:19:47,247
That's four.

736
01:19:48,457 --> 01:19:49,333
Six.

737
01:20:01,511 --> 01:20:03,597
Twelve.

738
01:20:51,311 --> 01:20:53,646
You're gonna die today.

739
01:20:53,730 --> 01:20:56,774
If you wanna make it fast,
tell me where the money is.

740
01:20:56,900 --> 01:20:59,736
If you wanna make it slow, don't.

741
01:20:59,819 --> 01:21:01,905
It's your choice.

742
01:21:03,823 --> 01:21:08,828
It's a good day for dyin'. I'll do it slow.

743
01:21:14,500 --> 01:21:17,837
Hey, slick. Cut him loose.

744
01:21:17,920 --> 01:21:21,007
Shit. I'm a dead man.

745
01:21:21,090 --> 01:21:23,176
Where is the money?

746
01:21:24,969 --> 01:21:27,055
Where is the money?

747
01:21:31,017 --> 01:21:35,188
Squeeze it, Harley. Just squeeze it.

748
01:21:42,862 --> 01:21:44,947
- Shit.
- Shit!

749
01:21:47,325 --> 01:21:50,286
That hurt, Harley. That hurt bad.

750
01:21:52,872 --> 01:21:55,541
Looks like your luck just ran out.

751
01:21:55,624 --> 01:21:58,544
Now, where is the money?

752
01:21:58,627 --> 01:22:00,713
Shoot him, goddamnit!

753
01:22:01,881 --> 01:22:05,468
Keep shooting. You'll make my job easier.

754
01:22:06,218 --> 01:22:10,055
Shoot the bastard!
Don't think, just shoot him!

755
01:22:10,139 --> 01:22:11,056
Shoot him!

756
01:22:41,754 --> 01:22:44,840
That one's for you. How'd it feel?

757
01:22:44,923 --> 01:22:47,593
Best twelve bucks I ever spent.

758
01:22:50,262 --> 01:22:52,264
Son of a bitch!

759
01:22:52,347 --> 01:22:54,683
How are you feelin'?

760
01:22:56,435 --> 01:23:00,314
Like I've been rode hard and put up wet.

761
01:23:00,439 --> 01:23:03,275
Shake it off. We got one more.

762
01:23:03,358 --> 01:23:05,444
Let's go.

763
01:23:14,911 --> 01:23:18,790
I can't believe
you fuckin' shot me, Harley.

764
01:23:21,042 --> 01:23:23,753
Dickhead, you fuckin' shot me.

765
01:23:25,630 --> 01:23:29,301
I can't believe you shot me, you shit bird.

766
01:23:35,640 --> 01:23:39,144
(pilot) I find it hard to believe
you greased those cue balls.

767
01:23:39,227 --> 01:23:41,521
But it's a good thing somebody did.

768
01:23:41,563 --> 01:23:45,066
- Yeah? Why's that?
- They were pussies.

769
01:23:46,067 --> 01:23:50,947
Their clothes were made outta
that lightweight Japanese Kevlar.

770
01:23:51,072 --> 01:23:52,991
(speaks Japanese)

771
01:24:12,218 --> 01:24:17,974
All right, pal, this is your last paycheck.
You work for us now.

772
01:24:29,986 --> 01:24:32,071
(speaks Japanese)

773
01:24:36,534 --> 01:24:38,369
Here's what we'll do.

774
01:24:38,453 --> 01:24:45,376
As soon as I ask him to change the lease
and he says no, just shoot his ass dead.

775
01:24:45,459 --> 01:24:49,630
- Why me?
- I'm all out of bullets.

776
01:24:56,095 --> 01:25:02,393
Howard, it's good to hear from you too.
What do you want from me? Spit it out.

777
01:25:05,312 --> 01:25:08,816
Listen, Howard,
I'm not interested in the Third World.

778
01:25:08,899 --> 01:25:11,902
Too much can go the wrong way
and not much can go our way.

779
01:25:11,986 --> 01:25:15,239
We've had this discussion.
I don't ever want to have it again.

780
01:25:15,364 --> 01:25:19,827
Say hello to your wife.
You're married, aren't you?

781
01:25:23,706 --> 01:25:27,501
Lookin' for Chance Wilder. You him?

782
01:25:31,005 --> 01:25:32,089
That's right.

783
01:25:33,173 --> 01:25:35,592
Deal away, Harley.

784
01:25:35,676 --> 01:25:37,761
Well, here.

785
01:25:38,846 --> 01:25:42,474
This is yours. We took it.
It wasn't right of us.

786
01:25:42,516 --> 01:25:47,438
So now you can change the lease back
to the Rock 'N' Roll Bar and Grille.

787
01:25:47,521 --> 01:25:50,691
No handouts. No breaks.

788
01:25:50,816 --> 01:25:53,527
Just a fair deal, that's all we're asking.

789
01:25:53,610 --> 01:25:58,866
You guys must be charmed
to have made it this far.

790
01:25:58,949 --> 01:26:02,035
Four of our friends are dead.

791
01:26:02,119 --> 01:26:05,914
No, we're not charmed.
We're just pissed off.

792
01:26:05,956 --> 01:26:08,041
That's too bad.

793
01:26:09,626 --> 01:26:12,379
That's too bad.

794
01:26:12,462 --> 01:26:15,298
Sorry I pissed you off.

795
01:26:15,382 --> 01:26:21,221
Listen, the lease stands, OK?
So that's the end of that story.

796
01:26:21,888 --> 01:26:28,145
So if you came here to kill me, do it now.
If not, get the fuck outta here.

797
01:26:28,228 --> 01:26:33,650
I don't have the time to play with
guys like you, OK? I'm very busy.

798
01:26:34,734 --> 01:26:35,986
This ain't a game.

799
01:26:36,111 --> 01:26:39,239
All business is a game
one way or another.

800
01:26:39,281 --> 01:26:43,076
- Sellin' drugs ain't no game.
- It's not your average game.

801
01:26:43,159 --> 01:26:48,164
I make $500,000 a year to sit
in this office and run this bank, OK?

802
01:26:48,206 --> 01:26:54,170
I make another $50 million a year to sit
in the same office and run those drugs.

803
01:26:54,254 --> 01:26:57,173
Now, that's a big game and it's big time.

804
01:26:57,257 --> 01:27:01,344
The game's over.
Go ahead and do it, Marlboro.

805
01:27:16,818 --> 01:27:20,613
What are you waitin' for?
Kill him and let's get outta here.

806
01:27:24,951 --> 01:27:27,036
I can't do it.

807
01:27:30,373 --> 01:27:32,125
It's not right.

808
01:27:32,208 --> 01:27:36,879
Hey, this scumbag killed
four of our friends just for laughs.

809
01:27:36,963 --> 01:27:39,048
Still doesn't make it right.

810
01:27:39,132 --> 01:27:41,551
What are you talkin' about?

811
01:27:42,844 --> 01:27:46,722
My old man used to tell me,
before he left this shitty world,

812
01:27:46,806 --> 01:27:48,891
never shoot an unarmed man.

813
01:27:48,975 --> 01:27:51,060
Fuck your old man. He's dead.

814
01:27:51,143 --> 01:27:54,063
Leave my old man out of this, all right?

815
01:27:55,815 --> 01:27:59,652
- Now he's armed.
- That gun's empty, Harley.

816
01:28:00,820 --> 01:28:05,491
So what? This piece of shit
gives drugs to kids.

817
01:28:05,574 --> 01:28:07,660
Drop it!

818
01:28:18,170 --> 01:28:22,842
You guys, did you really think you were
just gonna walk in here and shoot me?

819
01:28:22,925 --> 01:28:27,263
- You thought that, didn't you?
- That was the plan.

820
01:28:28,514 --> 01:28:30,599
Yeah, that was the plan.

821
01:28:30,683 --> 01:28:34,520
You guys, you guys are a piece of work.

822
01:28:34,603 --> 01:28:38,274
You got an edge.
And I like that. I do. I like that.

823
01:28:38,357 --> 01:28:44,613
It almost makes me sorry that I have to
kill you. But I do. I do right now.

824
01:29:46,174 --> 01:29:48,677
What'd you do? You pay him?

825
01:29:49,761 --> 01:29:55,600
No, man, that was your money.
You paid him. He did that for free.

826
01:29:57,769 --> 01:30:02,357
You guys. Like your buddy said,
fuck your old man.

827
01:30:02,440 --> 01:30:07,445
He's dead, right? Fuck him.
Let's see what you're made of.

828
01:30:15,537 --> 01:30:17,622
Think fast!

829
01:30:48,569 --> 01:30:49,904
Harley!

830
01:30:56,160 --> 01:30:59,413
- Good timing.
- I told you to shoot the fuck.

831
01:31:19,016 --> 01:31:22,520
Hey, guns are made to be shot,
not thrown.

832
01:31:25,940 --> 01:31:28,859
I was just tryin' to even the odds.

833
01:31:38,118 --> 01:31:41,121
Where're you goin' this time?

834
01:31:41,205 --> 01:31:43,707
Who says I'm goin'?

835
01:31:43,791 --> 01:31:47,461
You always do, Harley. It's that time.

836
01:31:49,296 --> 01:31:51,799
You wanna come with me?

837
01:31:54,968 --> 01:31:56,136
I can't.

838
01:31:58,055 --> 01:32:01,642
I shouldn't have asked. You never say yes.

839
01:32:13,153 --> 01:32:15,155
Get the hell outta here.

840
01:32:41,515 --> 01:32:43,600
Vaya con Dios, amigo.

841
01:32:45,852 --> 01:32:51,191
Robert Lee Edison, a third-generation
cowboy with his own brand of misery.

842
01:32:51,274 --> 01:32:55,111
He hails from Las Vegas,
and hasn't seen the back of a bull's neck

843
01:32:55,195 --> 01:32:59,866
since he got off real hard in the
National Finals Rodeo seven years ago.

844
01:32:59,950 --> 01:33:02,702
Let's see what he gets done
on a bull called Hondo,

845
01:33:02,786 --> 01:33:05,789
the top bull
of the Diamond S rodeo company.

846
01:33:05,872 --> 01:33:08,958
OK, big boy, let's make it a good one.

847
01:33:11,544 --> 01:33:12,545
Outside!

848
01:33:13,630 --> 01:33:15,715
OK, cowboy.

849
01:33:40,073 --> 01:33:42,158
Hey.

850
01:33:42,825 --> 01:33:45,495
Where you headin'?

851
01:33:45,578 --> 01:33:48,915
- Nowhere special.
- Come on, I'll take you there.
