1
00:00:32,732 --> 00:00:35,792
All l see
are sunny skies

2
00:00:37,537 --> 00:00:40,301
Every time l look
into your eyes

3
00:00:42,242 --> 00:00:45,109
Here we go again.
my friend

4
00:00:46,312 --> 00:00:49,440
Staying together
till the end

5
00:00:49,482 --> 00:00:52,076
lt's gonna be

6
00:00:52,118 --> 00:00:54,143
A lovely day

7
00:00:54,187 --> 00:00:56,553
lt's gonna be

8
00:00:56,589 --> 00:00:58,614
A lovely day

9
00:00:58,658 --> 00:01:01,252
lt's gonna be

10
00:01:01,294 --> 00:01:03,262
A lovely day

11
00:01:03,296 --> 00:01:05,662
lt's gonna be

12
00:01:05,698 --> 00:01:09,190
A lovely day

13
00:01:17,410 --> 00:01:20,504
Being out
in the open air

14
00:01:22,315 --> 00:01:25,716
Living life
like we just don't care

15
00:01:26,886 --> 00:01:29,719
Just doing what
we want to do

16
00:01:31,091 --> 00:01:34,458
Not doing
what we're supposed to

17
00:01:34,494 --> 00:01:36,792
lt's gonna be

18
00:01:36,830 --> 00:01:38,957
A lovely day

19
00:01:38,998 --> 00:01:41,523
lt's gonna be

20
00:01:41,568 --> 00:01:43,468
A lovely day

21
00:01:43,503 --> 00:01:45,471
lt's gonna be

22
00:01:45,505 --> 00:01:48,133
A lovely day

23
00:01:48,174 --> 00:01:50,540
lt's gonna be

24
00:01:50,577 --> 00:01:53,045
A lovely day

25
00:01:54,047 --> 00:01:56,106
We'll just float

26
00:01:56,149 --> 00:01:59,084
On top
of the clouds

27
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:02,111
That cover
our skies

28
00:02:02,155 --> 00:02:05,124
l said.
we'll just float

29
00:02:05,158 --> 00:02:08,025
On top
of the clouds

30
00:02:08,061 --> 00:02:11,121
That cover
our skies

31
00:02:11,164 --> 00:02:14,065
l said.
we'll just fly

32
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:17,194
On top
of the clouds

33
00:02:17,237 --> 00:02:21,640
That cover
our skies instead

34
00:02:54,908 --> 00:02:57,502
lt's gonna be

35
00:02:57,544 --> 00:02:59,569
A lovely day

36
00:02:59,612 --> 00:03:02,080
lt's gonna be

37
00:03:02,115 --> 00:03:04,083
A lovely day

38
00:03:04,117 --> 00:03:06,677
lt's gonna be

39
00:03:06,719 --> 00:03:08,687
A lovely day

40
00:03:09,055 --> 00:03:11,080
lt's gonna be

41
00:03:11,124 --> 00:03:14,491
A lovely day.

42
00:03:29,175 --> 00:03:32,702
Go. get outta here.

43
00:03:32,745 --> 00:03:35,578
Go!

44
00:03:51,798 --> 00:03:54,961
They say the higher
you aim.

45
00:03:55,001 --> 00:03:57,162
the farther
you fall.

46
00:03:57,203 --> 00:03:59,831
Fuck you. Eddie Kim.

47
00:03:59,872 --> 00:04:03,569
And look at you now.
Mr. Prosecutor. huh?

48
00:04:03,610 --> 00:04:06,010
Not so high
and mighty anymore.

49
00:04:10,183 --> 00:04:12,151
Well. that's
a noble gesture.

50
00:04:12,185 --> 00:04:14,483
l'll make sure
to tell your son

51
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:16,488
all about it.

52
00:04:16,522 --> 00:04:19,457
The reason he gets
to grow up without a father

53
00:04:19,492 --> 00:04:22,518
is because of how
goddamn noble he was.

54
00:04:24,130 --> 00:04:27,657
Then again. l was raised
by a single mom and...

55
00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:33,806
l didn't turn out
so bad. huh? Whoo!

56
00:04:40,013 --> 00:04:42,379
Clean this up.

57
00:04:42,415 --> 00:04:44,315
l'm going back to LA.

58
00:04:55,161 --> 00:04:57,959
Let's get the hell out
of here...

59
00:04:57,997 --> 00:04:59,726
and find that guy!

60
00:05:03,002 --> 00:05:04,560
This is Mi Jung Lee
reporting live

61
00:05:04,604 --> 00:05:06,071
from the Kaena Point area.

62
00:05:06,105 --> 00:05:09,268
Details remain sketchy in
the brutal slaying yesterday

63
00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:11,937
of Los Angeles prosecutor
Daniel Hayes.

64
00:05:11,978 --> 00:05:14,674
who was vacationing
in Hawaii.

65
00:05:14,714 --> 00:05:16,682
Hayes has been
in the news lately

66
00:05:16,716 --> 00:05:20,311
for his high-profile pursuit of reputed
mobster Edward Kim.

67
00:05:20,353 --> 00:05:22,947
Mr. Kim's representatives
have issued a statement

68
00:05:22,989 --> 00:05:25,514
of condolences
to the Hayes family

69
00:05:25,558 --> 00:05:27,526
and claim absolutely
no involvement

70
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:29,528
in what they call
a hideous act

71
00:05:29,562 --> 00:05:31,928
of violence.
The ongoing saga

72
00:05:31,964 --> 00:05:33,727
in the criminal
investigation

73
00:05:33,766 --> 00:05:36,291
of Mr. Kim involves charges
of murder. racketeering

74
00:05:36,336 --> 00:05:39,396
and police corruption
at the highest levels.

75
00:05:39,439 --> 00:05:42,340
both here in Hawaii
and on the mainland.

76
00:05:42,375 --> 00:05:44,206
Thank you. Mi Jung.

77
00:05:44,243 --> 00:05:45,801
We'll be sure to check in
for any updates

78
00:05:45,845 --> 00:05:48,370
as they become
available.

79
00:06:04,497 --> 00:06:06,522
Do as l say.
and you live.

80
00:06:07,867 --> 00:06:10,301
Stay flat against this wall.
Don't even breathe.

81
00:06:21,414 --> 00:06:24,406
Go go go. that way!

82
00:06:28,955 --> 00:06:31,515
Black car. go!

83
00:06:47,874 --> 00:06:49,364
What the hell is going on?

84
00:06:49,409 --> 00:06:51,434
You witnessed a murder
and didn't tell anybody.

85
00:06:51,477 --> 00:06:53,206
Why didn't you call
the police?

86
00:06:53,246 --> 00:06:55,544
The news said they were corrupt.
so l figured they'd be in on it.

87
00:06:55,581 --> 00:06:57,310
Smart kid.

88
00:06:57,350 --> 00:06:58,977
Who are you?

89
00:06:59,018 --> 00:07:00,986
l'm Agent
Neville Flynn. FBl.

90
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:03,488
Pleased
to meet you. Sean.

91
00:07:16,269 --> 00:07:19,397
l gotta tell you. Sean. l'm getting
a little tired of all this garbage

92
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:22,306
you've been feeding me.

93
00:07:22,341 --> 00:07:24,309
We know you were there.
Your prints are all over it.

94
00:07:24,343 --> 00:07:26,504
so stop insulting
my intelligence.

95
00:07:26,546 --> 00:07:30,209
You witnessed a murder.
You have a responsibility.

96
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:38,882
Look here. Sean.

97
00:07:40,526 --> 00:07:42,790
l've been doing this for a while.
so l know all kinds

98
00:07:42,829 --> 00:07:44,956
of neat little
interrogation tricks.

99
00:07:44,997 --> 00:07:47,522
You know. good cop
bad cop.

100
00:07:47,567 --> 00:07:50,798
reverse psychology.
stare-down contests. threats.

101
00:07:50,837 --> 00:07:54,295
You name it.
l've done it.

102
00:07:54,340 --> 00:07:56,604
But why don't we
leapfrog all that bullshit.

103
00:07:56,642 --> 00:07:58,906
save ourselves a lot
of aggravation and time.

104
00:07:58,945 --> 00:08:01,914
of which there is
close to zero.

105
00:08:01,948 --> 00:08:05,042
and l tell you
the truth?

106
00:08:05,084 --> 00:08:07,746
Truth is l'm not
worried about you

107
00:08:07,787 --> 00:08:09,550
if you testify.

108
00:08:09,589 --> 00:08:11,921
But l am worried
about you if you don't.

109
00:08:16,395 --> 00:08:19,626
What-- what if l didn't see him clearly?
l mean. l wouldn't be--

110
00:08:19,665 --> 00:08:23,101
What did l just tell you about saving us
aggravation and time?

111
00:08:23,135 --> 00:08:25,626
He knows who you are!

112
00:08:25,671 --> 00:08:28,162
That's why those people
were at your house trying to kill you.

113
00:08:28,207 --> 00:08:30,334
And make no mistake.

114
00:08:30,376 --> 00:08:33,971
Eddie Kim will kill you.

115
00:08:34,013 --> 00:08:35,503
if you let him.

116
00:08:35,548 --> 00:08:39,211
Last week l was planning
a surfing trip to Bali.

117
00:08:40,253 --> 00:08:42,744
Now...

118
00:08:42,788 --> 00:08:44,779
now you make it sound
like l have no choice--

119
00:08:44,824 --> 00:08:47,258
Oh. no no no no no no no no no.
You got choices.

120
00:08:47,293 --> 00:08:49,761
You got tons
of choices.

121
00:08:49,795 --> 00:08:52,423
but there's only one
correct choice:

122
00:08:52,465 --> 00:08:53,591
Come with us to LA.

123
00:08:53,633 --> 00:08:56,067
testify against his ass.

124
00:08:56,102 --> 00:08:58,070
put him in jail
for life.

125
00:08:58,104 --> 00:09:00,572
Tell you what:

126
00:09:00,606 --> 00:09:03,302
You sit here.
think about it.

127
00:09:03,342 --> 00:09:06,505
You let us know
what you decide.

128
00:09:06,546 --> 00:09:08,537
We'll be outside.

129
00:09:21,761 --> 00:09:24,525
The white zone is for
immediate in-loading

130
00:09:24,564 --> 00:09:27,431
and unloading
of passengers only.

131
00:09:27,466 --> 00:09:30,196
So you got any requests
for your final flight?

132
00:09:30,236 --> 00:09:33,228
Well. just what
any flight attendant wants.

133
00:09:33,272 --> 00:09:35,672
Low-maintenance
passengers.

134
00:09:35,708 --> 00:09:39,337
Uh-huh. that would
be very nice.

135
00:09:43,749 --> 00:09:45,910
A'ite. ladies.

136
00:09:45,952 --> 00:09:47,920
Hey. Troy. Leroy. l got this. all right?
Let me sign 'em for them.

137
00:09:47,954 --> 00:09:49,922
Let me sign 'em for them.
Gimme that marker. son.

138
00:09:49,956 --> 00:09:53,858
How you doing. sweetie?
You all right? There you go.

139
00:09:53,893 --> 00:09:55,690
You take care. baby.
All right.

140
00:09:55,728 --> 00:09:58,253
- Can l get your autograph?
- You can get a little more than that.

141
00:09:58,297 --> 00:10:01,698
Yeah. no doubt. Let me do this on
the special for you right there.

142
00:10:01,734 --> 00:10:05,431
- Mmm. yeah. Mm-hmm.

143
00:10:05,471 --> 00:10:07,439
Mmm!

- Take care. all right.

145
00:10:09,542 --> 00:10:12,033
- Will you sign this. please?
- Oh yeah. no doubt. little man.

146
00:10:12,078 --> 00:10:14,069
Here we go.

147
00:10:14,113 --> 00:10:15,944
- Mm. there you go.
- Thank you.

148
00:10:15,982 --> 00:10:19,076
- Hey. yo. stay black.
- Hells. yeah.

149
00:10:19,118 --> 00:10:20,676
All right.

150
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:23,245
All right. y'all. God bless you.
l gotta get out of here

151
00:10:23,289 --> 00:10:25,814
and catch this flight. all right?
Y'all take care. Catch the next album.

152
00:10:25,858 --> 00:10:27,985
- We can't wait!
- Yeah. all right. no doubt.

153
00:10:29,862 --> 00:10:32,057
All right. look. we gotta make sure
we got some more of this. all right?

154
00:10:33,899 --> 00:10:36,026
- Look at the Howard Hughes of rap.
- What?

155
00:10:36,068 --> 00:10:38,036
What was that?

156
00:10:38,070 --> 00:10:40,004
He-- he said.
man. can you believe this crap?

157
00:10:40,039 --> 00:10:42,667
- Man. this is crap right here.
- Hey. yo. come on. y'all.

158
00:10:42,708 --> 00:10:44,107
Y'all messing with t-shirts and hats.

159
00:10:44,143 --> 00:10:45,508
Y'all are supposed to be
watching my back. son.

160
00:10:45,544 --> 00:10:47,341
- Come on.
- You're right. brother. l got you.

161
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:50,281
Ladies and gentlemen.

00:10:50,316 --> 00:10:52,045
- has been delayed half an hour.
- Oh. come on!

163
00:10:52,084 --> 00:10:53,779
We apologize
for this inconvenience

164
00:10:53,819 --> 00:10:55,719
and we'll begin boarding
as soon as possible.

165
00:10:55,755 --> 00:10:57,723
Oh. boy.
lt's gonna be a fun flight.

166
00:10:57,757 --> 00:11:00,191
Aloha all lsland
Express passengers...

167
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:03,357
Five whole hours.

168
00:11:03,396 --> 00:11:06,229
Do you know who's working today?
l didn't get a crew list.

169
00:11:06,265 --> 00:11:08,631
You know.
l have no idea.

170
00:11:09,902 --> 00:11:11,267
Oh my God.
Here she comes. Here she comes!

171
00:11:13,673 --> 00:11:15,732
- Surprise!
- Surprise!

172
00:11:15,775 --> 00:11:17,402
Oh!

173
00:11:18,911 --> 00:11:21,744
Oh. Claire. don't go.

174
00:11:21,781 --> 00:11:23,749
Last thing the world
needs is another lawyer.

175
00:11:23,783 --> 00:11:25,478
l mean. really.
how could you leave all this?

176
00:11:25,518 --> 00:11:28,214
- lt's gonna be hard.
- Will you take me with you?

177
00:11:28,254 --> 00:11:30,688
Please.

178
00:11:30,723 --> 00:11:33,248
Could we ask for Bruno
from Simply Corporate?

179
00:11:33,292 --> 00:11:36,125
Elena. by we.
l mean you.

180
00:11:36,162 --> 00:11:39,495
No. not all drivers are the same.
That's the point.

181
00:11:39,532 --> 00:11:41,796
The last thing l need is some guy
going on and on

182
00:11:41,834 --> 00:11:45,395
about the weather
the whole way home. Get Bruno.

183
00:11:47,406 --> 00:11:50,068
Mary Kate. hush.

184
00:11:50,109 --> 00:11:53,442
Sorry. she gets
nervous flying.

185
00:11:53,479 --> 00:11:56,004
Oh. that's okay.

186
00:11:56,048 --> 00:11:57,640
l understand.
you know.

187
00:11:57,683 --> 00:11:59,913
Do you think she'll
want some Xanax?

188
00:11:59,952 --> 00:12:03,183
Oh no. she's okay.

189
00:12:07,159 --> 00:12:09,127
How you feeling?

190
00:12:09,161 --> 00:12:11,322
Yeah. fine.

191
00:12:11,363 --> 00:12:13,297
You ready for this?

192
00:12:13,332 --> 00:12:15,562
Yeah.

193
00:12:17,536 --> 00:12:19,333
ls that our plane?

194
00:12:19,371 --> 00:12:22,772
No. every cop in Honolulu
thinks it is.

195
00:12:24,210 --> 00:12:26,974
Hey. come on. relax.

196
00:12:44,630 --> 00:12:46,598
FBl's escorting
some guy to LA.

197
00:12:46,632 --> 00:12:48,429
They just took over
all first class.

198
00:12:48,467 --> 00:12:50,298
Are they allowed
to do that?

199
00:12:50,336 --> 00:12:52,395
Well. apparently
FAA Section 108 states.

200
00:12:52,438 --> 00:12:55,032
''lf deemed necessary.
they can do whatever they want.''

201
00:12:55,074 --> 00:12:58,009
Well. who's gonna tell the first class
passengers they're flying coach?

202
00:12:58,043 --> 00:13:00,409
That would be you. kid.

203
00:13:16,128 --> 00:13:18,653
South Pacific Air 1 21.

204
00:13:22,935 --> 00:13:24,630
Oh. my.

205
00:13:24,670 --> 00:13:27,503
l was hoping you'd
be the sky candy on this flight.

206
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:30,236
You're looking especially
delicious this evening.

207
00:13:30,276 --> 00:13:32,301
l love it when you
demean me. Rick.

208
00:13:32,344 --> 00:13:34,938
My pleasure.
l gotta go fly a big plane.

209
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:37,244
- Hi. doll.
- Hi there. Rick.

210
00:13:37,283 --> 00:13:39,513
lsn't he smooth?

211
00:13:42,454 --> 00:13:45,287
Yes. sir. l'm soaking
the leis with it.

212
00:13:46,625 --> 00:13:49,685
The pheromone will make
these guys go fucking crazy.

213
00:13:52,565 --> 00:13:54,556
Duke.

214
00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:03,165
Leave it. Duke.

215
00:14:07,646 --> 00:14:10,945
- Ladies.
- Welcome aboard.

216
00:14:10,983 --> 00:14:12,974
Agent Flynn.

217
00:14:19,325 --> 00:14:21,418
Ladies and gentlemen.
this is the final boarding call

218
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:23,860
- for South Pacific Air. flight 1 21...
- Aloha.

219
00:14:23,896 --> 00:14:25,488
- Thank you.
- with nonstop service to Los Angeles.

220
00:14:25,531 --> 00:14:27,897
- Aloha.
- No no no. the hair.

221
00:14:27,933 --> 00:14:30,595
Aloha.

222
00:14:34,139 --> 00:14:37,199
Unfortunately. first class
is overbooked.

223
00:14:37,243 --> 00:14:39,040
But there's plenty of room for you
to stretch out in coach.

224
00:14:39,078 --> 00:14:40,807
which is less than half full.
For the inconvenience.

225
00:14:40,846 --> 00:14:43,212
we are offering you
a free travel coupon

226
00:14:43,249 --> 00:14:45,240
good on any South Pacific
Air flight.

227
00:14:45,284 --> 00:14:48,082
A free travel coupon won't help me get
to my meeting on time. now will it?

228
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:50,611
Sir. l'm pretty sure
that coach gets to Los Angeles

229
00:14:50,656 --> 00:14:52,624
about the same time
as first.

230
00:14:52,658 --> 00:14:56,059
Funny. Does my premium awards
membership come with sarcasm.

231
00:14:56,095 --> 00:14:59,030
or should l speak
to your supervisor. Claire?

232
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:03,925
This better be a matter
of national security.

233
00:15:03,969 --> 00:15:06,130
Did l just hear
there's no first class?

234
00:15:06,171 --> 00:15:08,264
l'm afraid only coach
is available.

235
00:15:08,307 --> 00:15:10,969
Coach?
ls it safe there?

236
00:15:12,578 --> 00:15:15,445
Yes. it is safe there.

237
00:15:25,024 --> 00:15:26,992
Never flown
first class before.

238
00:15:27,026 --> 00:15:29,392
See. things are
looking up already.

239
00:15:33,032 --> 00:15:36,968
So how long you and Mr. Personality
been working together?

240
00:15:37,002 --> 00:15:39,971
Um... five years.

241
00:15:40,005 --> 00:15:42,974
one blown marriage each.

242
00:15:43,008 --> 00:15:45,306
He's the toughest
son of a bitch l ever met.

243
00:15:45,344 --> 00:15:47,835
Wow.

244
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:49,711
Yep. that's us.

245
00:15:49,748 --> 00:15:51,739
The glamour
and the glory.

246
00:15:53,819 --> 00:15:57,778
Flynn. the captain's patching us
through to Harris for the flight.

247
00:16:05,464 --> 00:16:07,830
Harris.
Special Agent Harris.

248
00:16:07,866 --> 00:16:10,198
Harris. so how's
the new promotion?

249
00:16:10,235 --> 00:16:12,795
- l'm loving it.
- That was a little quick.

250
00:16:12,838 --> 00:16:15,636
- Wanna try again?
- No no. l'm serious. man.

251
00:16:15,674 --> 00:16:18,507
You know. no more-- no more
junk food hangovers

252
00:16:18,544 --> 00:16:21,012
after all-night stakeouts.
you know?

253
00:16:21,046 --> 00:16:24,413
l'm actually spending nights
in bed with my wife.

254
00:16:24,450 --> 00:16:26,748
She's hot.
You know. and my kids.

255
00:16:26,785 --> 00:16:28,753
you know. forget about 'em.
They're kids.

256
00:16:28,787 --> 00:16:31,381
l'm just spending every
waking minute with them.

257
00:16:31,423 --> 00:16:33,015
You know. they're fun.

258
00:16:33,058 --> 00:16:35,856
Please. this is me
you're talking to.

259
00:16:35,894 --> 00:16:38,692
You know you miss it.
You miss the action.

260
00:16:38,731 --> 00:16:41,996
You're bored to tears. So what are you
actually doing with your time?

261
00:16:42,034 --> 00:16:44,969
- Surfing the net.
- Porn. no doubt.

262
00:16:45,004 --> 00:16:48,462
No. hey. eBay.
my cynical-minded friend.

263
00:16:48,507 --> 00:16:51,601
l'm right in the middle of a bidding war
with this punk-ass kid from lowa

264
00:16:51,643 --> 00:16:54,077
for this black velvet...

265
00:16:54,113 --> 00:16:55,910
Pamela Anderson poster.

266
00:16:55,948 --> 00:16:58,075
Not technically porn.

267
00:16:58,117 --> 00:17:00,642
So how's
Eddie Kim doing?

268
00:17:00,686 --> 00:17:03,052
You ain't gotta worry about him.
He ain't going anywhere.

269
00:17:03,088 --> 00:17:06,114
No. l got three teams on him.
so he's not gonna move.

270
00:17:06,158 --> 00:17:10,026
All right. l'll see you
on the other side.

271
00:17:25,144 --> 00:17:27,704
Are you sure
about this?

272
00:17:27,746 --> 00:17:29,941
Accidents happen.

273
00:17:29,982 --> 00:17:32,883
You think l didn't exhaust
every other option?

274
00:17:32,918 --> 00:17:34,749
He saw me!

275
00:17:34,787 --> 00:17:36,812
You're gonna be right down
this aisle to the left.

276
00:17:36,855 --> 00:17:38,652
- Thank you.
- Oh. look at the little baby.

277
00:17:38,690 --> 00:17:40,385
- He's beautiful.
- Thank you.

278
00:17:43,429 --> 00:17:44,953
Oh. beautiful.

279
00:17:44,997 --> 00:17:47,192
- Cheese.
- First. they stick me in coach

280
00:17:47,232 --> 00:17:50,668
and then they put a freaking dog
next to me. What the hell is next?

281
00:17:50,702 --> 00:17:52,363
Oh. you're adorable.

282
00:17:54,273 --> 00:17:55,934
Okay.

283
00:17:58,610 --> 00:18:00,805
Oh. great.
Just great.

284
00:18:00,846 --> 00:18:04,247
ls there
a problem. mister?

285
00:18:04,283 --> 00:18:06,911
Oh. gee.
what do you think?

286
00:18:10,022 --> 00:18:11,580
Will you at least
get that vermin to shut up?

287
00:18:11,623 --> 00:18:13,591
Don't worry. Mary Kate.

288
00:18:13,625 --> 00:18:15,650
His hair plugs
can't hurt you.

289
00:18:19,331 --> 00:18:23,062
Fucking dog. fucking coach.
fucking Americans!

290
00:18:23,102 --> 00:18:26,731
Hi. Oh. l'm really sorry about first
class. Let me see if l can help--

291
00:18:26,772 --> 00:18:29,502
Oh. oh. sweet-- Could you let her know
not to touch me. son?

292
00:18:29,541 --> 00:18:31,509
Oh. please.
don't touch the man.

293
00:18:31,543 --> 00:18:34,205
Man don't like to be touched.
We'll find our own seats.

294
00:18:34,246 --> 00:18:37,113
Oh. sorry.
Here's some coupons.

295
00:18:37,149 --> 00:18:39,674
- You all right. man?
- Yeah. l'm all right. man.

296
00:18:52,898 --> 00:18:54,889
All right.

297
00:18:54,933 --> 00:18:57,128
Coach ain't looking
so bad after all.

298
00:19:02,407 --> 00:19:05,399
Bad boy.

299
00:19:05,444 --> 00:19:08,572
Hey. yo. check it.
Check it out. check it out.

300
00:19:08,614 --> 00:19:11,048
You like that.

301
00:19:11,083 --> 00:19:14,575
Baby got back. front
and side-to-side.

302
00:19:14,620 --> 00:19:16,588
Hey. y'all two get together.

303
00:19:16,622 --> 00:19:18,681
like. two 20-lb
babies or something.

304
00:19:23,128 --> 00:19:24,857
Dad. why can't you
come with us?

305
00:19:24,897 --> 00:19:26,865
Come on.
you're gonna be fine.

306
00:19:26,899 --> 00:19:28,560
Bet you're even
gonna have fun.

307
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:31,034
- He's just being a baby.
- Curtis.

308
00:19:31,069 --> 00:19:33,162
l'm counting on you to be a man.
Now what does a man do?

309
00:19:33,205 --> 00:19:35,696
- He looks out for his family.
- That's right.

310
00:19:35,741 --> 00:19:39,507
- Sir.
- Oh. sorry.

311
00:19:39,545 --> 00:19:42,343
My wife is meeting them in LA.
lt's their first time flying solo.

312
00:19:42,381 --> 00:19:45,839
That's okay.
Hey.

313
00:19:45,884 --> 00:19:48,045
- Can l tell you a secret?
- What?

314
00:19:48,086 --> 00:19:50,054
- Guess who's on the plane?
- Who?

315
00:19:50,088 --> 00:19:51,783
Three G's.

316
00:19:51,823 --> 00:19:55,350
- For real?
- l bet you could meet him.

317
00:19:55,394 --> 00:19:57,419
Come on. Tommy.
let's go.

318
00:20:10,776 --> 00:20:12,471
Ladies and gentlemen.

319
00:20:12,511 --> 00:20:15,036

322
00:20:19,585 --> 00:20:22,645
to Los Angeles. At this time. l would
like your full attention

323
00:20:22,688 --> 00:20:24,815
as the flight attendants
demonstrate

324
00:20:24,856 --> 00:20:26,847
the safety features
of this aircraft.

325
00:20:26,892 --> 00:20:28,860
When the seat belt sign
illuminates.

326
00:20:28,894 --> 00:20:31,089
you must fasten
your seat belt.

327
00:20:31,129 --> 00:20:34,223
There are several emergency
exits on the aircraft.

328
00:20:34,266 --> 00:20:36,291
located in
the forward section.

329
00:20:36,335 --> 00:20:38,530
aft section
and over each wing.

330
00:20:38,570 --> 00:20:40,970
ln the event
of decompression...

331
00:20:41,006 --> 00:20:42,974
an oxygen mask will
automatically drop

332
00:20:43,008 --> 00:20:44,566
from a compartment
above your seat.

333
00:20:44,610 --> 00:20:46,475
To start the flow
of oxygen.

334
00:20:46,511 --> 00:20:49,071
pull the mask towards you.
place it firmly

335
00:20:49,114 --> 00:20:50,843
over your nose
and mouth.

336
00:20:50,882 --> 00:20:53,908
secure the elastic band behind your
head and breathe normally.

337
00:20:53,952 --> 00:20:57,649
A lifejacket is located in a pouch
under your seat.

338
00:20:57,689 --> 00:21:00,487
This is how you put it on.
Slip it over your head.

339
00:21:00,525 --> 00:21:02,493
pass the straps
around your waist

340
00:21:02,527 --> 00:21:04,825
and adjust loosely
at the front.

341
00:21:04,863 --> 00:21:08,629
Tampering with. disabling or destroying
the smoke detectors located

342
00:21:08,667 --> 00:21:12,125
in the lavatories
is prohibited by law.

343
00:21:12,170 --> 00:21:14,638
We wish you
an enjoyable flight.

344
00:21:23,982 --> 00:21:26,815
Radar indicates a bit
of weather up ahead.

345
00:21:26,852 --> 00:21:28,820
We might catch
a few bumps in the road.

346
00:21:28,854 --> 00:21:31,721
but we'll be above most of it.
lf you need anything at all.

347
00:21:31,757 --> 00:21:34,783
you just holler at one
of those gorgeous flight attendants

348
00:21:34,826 --> 00:21:37,124
and they'll take good care of y'all.
Thank you.

349
00:21:37,162 --> 00:21:40,222
Good evening.

Hi. Tiffany.

So. um. mind if l. um...

354
00:22:01,019 --> 00:22:03,817

355
00:22:03,855 --> 00:22:05,447
Oh. me?
Nothing.

356
00:22:07,592 --> 00:22:09,787
lt's what l'm
supposed to do.

357
00:22:11,363 --> 00:22:13,331
Ever heard of Eddie Kim?

358
00:22:13,365 --> 00:22:15,526
Oh. who hasn't?

359
00:22:15,567 --> 00:22:18,092
Oh. l was watching one
of those crime shows once.

360
00:22:18,136 --> 00:22:20,798
you know. with the hokey
reenactments.

361
00:22:20,839 --> 00:22:23,899
where he tortured this guy who was
a witness against him

362
00:22:23,942 --> 00:22:26,274
by gouging out his eyes

363
00:22:26,311 --> 00:22:29,439
and then feeding him
to some pigs.

364
00:22:29,481 --> 00:22:31,881
Pretty gruesome stuff.

365
00:22:31,917 --> 00:22:35,717
Yeah. he doesn't
mess around. that guy.

366
00:22:35,754 --> 00:22:37,415
So. um. you know.

367
00:22:37,456 --> 00:22:39,356
what are you--
what do you have to...

368
00:22:39,391 --> 00:22:41,951
l'm a witness
for the prosecution.

369
00:22:41,993 --> 00:22:45,292
- Wow.
- Yeah.

370
00:22:45,330 --> 00:22:48,231
That is so...

371
00:22:48,266 --> 00:22:50,257
hot.

372
00:23:12,924 --> 00:23:15,017
l'm gonna miss these
night flights.

373
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:18,723
l enjoy the passengers so much better
when they're unconscious.

374
00:23:20,565 --> 00:23:22,430
And you.
l'm gonna miss you.

375
00:23:24,736 --> 00:23:26,294
- Excuse me.
- Yes.

376
00:23:26,338 --> 00:23:28,203

378
00:23:33,044 --> 00:23:35,569
Ooh. wow.

Not really. l was there for
the kickboxing tournament.

381
00:23:43,288 --> 00:23:45,984
Oh my God.
You're a kickboxer?

382
00:23:46,024 --> 00:23:47,616
Me too.

383
00:23:47,659 --> 00:23:50,526
Well. l take a kickboxing
class with Lonnie. Malibu Fitness.

392
00:24:06,878 --> 00:24:09,142
Hey. will you
look around?

393
00:24:09,181 --> 00:24:11,308
Look around the plane.

394
00:24:11,349 --> 00:24:13,977
How come there aren't
more people on this flight?

395
00:24:14,019 --> 00:24:16,146
l can't figure it out.

396
00:24:16,188 --> 00:24:19,624
Honey. 'cause it's
the red eye. Hmm?

397
00:24:23,128 --> 00:24:25,255
Okay. okay.

398
00:24:25,297 --> 00:24:28,664
- l'm sorry. sweetie.
- No. l accept-- l accept that.

399
00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:31,567
lf you hated flying this much.
why did you let me pick Hawaii

400
00:24:31,603 --> 00:24:33,696
for our honeymoon?

401
00:24:36,107 --> 00:24:38,701
'Cause that's where
you wanted to go.

402
00:24:48,119 --> 00:24:50,110
- Thanks.

404
00:24:56,428 --> 00:24:58,589
You said earlier you

405
00:24:58,630 --> 00:25:01,827
lt's a very beautiful place.

406
00:25:01,867 --> 00:25:05,268
You surf?
You don't look like a surfer.

407
00:25:05,303 --> 00:25:07,635
- No disrespect.
- Hey. none taken.

408
00:25:07,672 --> 00:25:10,470
And l did try it.

409
00:25:10,509 --> 00:25:13,171
in the ocean when l could lay on
the beach and admire all the beauties.

410
00:25:13,211 --> 00:25:15,179
- you know what l mean?
- Yeah.

411
00:25:15,213 --> 00:25:17,306
Couldn't stay on
your board. could you?

- Can l help you?
- No. l'm just stretching my legs.

414
00:25:47,345 --> 00:25:49,438
Big plane. plenty of
places to do it.

415
00:25:49,481 --> 00:25:52,143
Plenty of other places
to do it. you mean.

416

l do something
wrong here?

417
00:25:56,421 --> 00:25:59,083
Technically. no.

418
00:25:59,124 --> 00:26:01,649
But maybe next time. you people
could give us a little heads up

419
00:26:01,693 --> 00:26:03,718
before you commandeer
the plane.

420
00:26:03,762 --> 00:26:06,094
You people?

450
00:28:44,522 --> 00:28:47,491
the music business

00:28:54,733 --> 00:28:56,291
You okay?

and the business
to the next level.

455
00:29:03,541 --> 00:29:05,941
You know what l'm saying?
That's when evolution

456
00:29:05,977 --> 00:29:07,945
becomes revolution.

457
00:29:13,551 --> 00:29:15,348

Oh. This guy

463
00:30:58,723 --> 00:31:00,782
Well. maybe not that good.

464

00:32:36,187 --> 00:32:37,779
l'll be back.

475
00:32:49,834 --> 00:32:53,201
How's my big boy?

476
00:33:04,983 --> 00:33:06,450
Aw. fuck!

477
00:33:09,253 --> 00:33:11,915
Fucking bitch!
Get off my dick!

478
00:33:11,956 --> 00:33:14,356
Aw. fuck!

479
00:33:16,961 --> 00:33:19,191
Fuck.

480
00:33:56,067 --> 00:33:58,865
'Cause. you know. keeping your sexy
right is part of the business too.

481
00:33:58,903 --> 00:34:00,871
And if you
don't mind me saying.

482
00:34:00,905 --> 00:34:03,567
it looks like you keep
your sexy very. very right.

483
00:34:03,608 --> 00:34:05,838
Well. thank you.

484
00:34:05,877 --> 00:34:09,108
- Have you ever acted before?
- No.

485
00:34:09,147 --> 00:34:12,139
'Cause you know. l-- l would love to put
you in one of my pool-party videos.

486
00:34:12,183 --> 00:34:13,741
- Oh. yeah?
- Throw a little thong on you--

487
00:34:13,785 --> 00:34:16,151
- Excuse me. she just wants a treat.
- All right.

488
00:34:19,991 --> 00:34:21,891
l can never find
anything in here.

489
00:34:21,926 --> 00:34:23,894
Her doctor says
she's bipolar.

490
00:34:25,596 --> 00:34:28,258
l almost beat the last level.

491
00:34:28,299 --> 00:34:30,164
Hey. man. you playing
that damn video game?

492
00:34:30,201 --> 00:34:32,066
Or was that video
game playing you. son?

493
00:34:33,171 --> 00:34:35,605
- Damn!
- Found them.

494
00:35:12,710 --> 00:35:16,578
Sir. l can assure you.
there's no strange smell.

495
00:35:16,614 --> 00:35:18,411
Maybe you're
allergic to the leis.

496
00:35:18,449 --> 00:35:20,383
Let me take
that for you.

497
00:35:20,418 --> 00:35:22,386
Oh. yeah.

498
00:35:24,088 --> 00:35:25,612
Thank you. miss.

499
00:35:25,656 --> 00:35:27,521
Any idea how long this
turbulence will last?

500
00:35:27,558 --> 00:35:29,856
No. l'm okay.

501
00:35:29,894 --> 00:35:32,124
Well. l'm gonna go
and ask the pilot.

502
00:35:39,670 --> 00:35:41,365
Aw. shit. Rick.
we got smoke.

503
00:35:41,405 --> 00:35:43,805
Something probably
arced in the avionics.

504
00:35:49,847 --> 00:35:53,476
How much longer do you
think before we climb-- what happened?

505
00:35:53,518 --> 00:35:55,008
We lost the board.

506
00:35:55,052 --> 00:35:56,849
l gotta reset
the breakers.

507
00:35:58,789 --> 00:36:00,814
- Keep her steady. Rick.
- All right.

508
00:36:26,083 --> 00:36:28,745
Okay. Cap.
they're coming back!

509
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:37,887
That's it. old man.
we're back in busin--

510
00:36:43,034 --> 00:36:44,729
Captain!

511
00:36:46,604 --> 00:36:47,935
- Rick!
- What is it?

512
00:36:47,972 --> 00:36:50,702
Something's happened
to the captain!

513
00:36:50,741 --> 00:36:53,073
All right. Coming.

514
00:36:54,979 --> 00:36:56,879
Oh. Christ.

515
00:36:58,683 --> 00:37:00,913
- Did you-- did you see what happened?
- No.

516
00:37:04,555 --> 00:37:06,147
Captain?

517
00:37:08,426 --> 00:37:10,223
l think he's had
a heart attack.

518
00:37:18,569 --> 00:37:20,298
Agent Flynn.
Agent Sanders.

519
00:37:20,338 --> 00:37:22,203
can l see you
for a moment. please?

520
00:37:40,024 --> 00:37:42,288
l flew with that man
for 10 years.

521
00:37:43,628 --> 00:37:45,152
Let's go back.

522
00:37:45,196 --> 00:37:47,630
We're halfway. lt'd take longer
to get back to Honolulu

523
00:37:47,665 --> 00:37:49,189
than keep going to LA.

524
00:37:49,233 --> 00:37:51,201
Make sure everybody's
strapped in.

525
00:37:58,743 --> 00:38:01,439
LAX tower.
this is Hula 1-2-1.

526
00:38:01,479 --> 00:38:03,003
mayday. mayday. mayday.

527
00:38:03,047 --> 00:38:05,481
pilot in command has suffered
a fatal heart attack.

528
00:38:05,516 --> 00:38:08,178
Ladies and gentlemen.
the Captain requests

529
00:38:08,219 --> 00:38:09,914
- that you remain in your seats...
- Shhh.

530
00:38:09,954 --> 00:38:11,649
with your
seat belts fastened.

531
00:38:11,689 --> 00:38:13,884
Thank you.

532
00:38:13,924 --> 00:38:15,949
Shhh. shhh.

533
00:38:38,916 --> 00:38:41,646
Hi. how are you doing?

534
00:38:41,686 --> 00:38:43,950
Think of it like
a roller coaster ride.

535
00:38:43,988 --> 00:38:45,512
Do you like
roller coaster rides?

536
00:38:45,556 --> 00:38:47,547
No. not really.

537
00:38:47,591 --> 00:38:50,924
No. me neither.
They always make me sick.

538
00:38:50,961 --> 00:38:54,158
Okay. Here's what
we're gonna do:

539
00:38:54,198 --> 00:38:55,790
You are gonna
close your eyes

540
00:38:55,833 --> 00:38:58,165
and count
very slowly to 10.

541
00:38:58,202 --> 00:39:01,638
And when you open your eyes. you make
the funniest face you can at each other.

542
00:39:01,672 --> 00:39:04,368
And whoever
laughs first loses.

543
00:39:04,408 --> 00:39:07,343
Okay?
Best out of five wins.

544
00:39:07,378 --> 00:39:10,370
And l will be back to
check on the winner.

545
00:39:14,218 --> 00:39:16,743
One. two. three...

546
00:39:16,787 --> 00:39:19,756
- Sir. seat belt please.
- Yeah. Great.

547
00:39:19,790 --> 00:39:21,655
Thank you.

548
00:39:41,846 --> 00:39:44,041
Oh my God!

549
00:39:46,417 --> 00:39:48,476
What the--

550
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:57,728

551
00:40:02,133 --> 00:40:04,499
Ow! Ow!

552
00:40:04,535 --> 00:40:07,060

555
00:40:17,148 --> 00:40:18,775
Oh. shit.

- Get down!

557
00:40:50,114 --> 00:40:52,776
Rick. what's up with
the oxygen masks deploying?

558
00:40:52,817 --> 00:40:54,751
Oh. sorry about that.

559
00:40:54,785 --> 00:40:57,413
You're not gonna believe what came out
of the goddamn instrument panel.

560
00:40:57,455 --> 00:40:59,252
What?

561
00:40:59,290 --> 00:41:00,951
Look at this.

562
00:41:00,991 --> 00:41:03,050
Goddamn snake. honey!

563
00:41:21,378 --> 00:41:23,175

00:48:53,764 --> 00:48:55,732
Oh my God. Grace.

635
00:48:55,766 --> 00:48:58,166
Okay. okay.

636
00:49:01,171 --> 00:49:03,366
Okay.

637
00:49:03,407 --> 00:49:05,375
- Let me. let me. l got her.
- Oh my God.

638
00:49:05,409 --> 00:49:07,775
l have to go
and tell Rick.

639
00:49:07,811 --> 00:49:11,474
Grab the first-aid kit!
Grace. hey hey hey...

640
00:49:11,515 --> 00:49:15,007
Here's some water.
Come on. man. you got to drink water.

641
00:49:15,052 --> 00:49:17,577
Breathe. breathe.

642
00:49:17,621 --> 00:49:20,112
We missed the bastards

643
00:49:20,157 --> 00:49:22,250
because they
were cold-blooded.

644
00:49:22,292 --> 00:49:24,055
Come on. come on.

645
00:49:24,094 --> 00:49:26,688
John. John. listen
to me. you're okay.

646
00:49:26,730 --> 00:49:29,699
Just take a deep breath.
John. you're having a panic attack.

647
00:49:34,538 --> 00:49:36,733
Mmm...

648
00:49:38,909 --> 00:49:40,672
Oh. shit.

649
00:49:44,681 --> 00:49:46,581
You've gotta
be kidding me!

650
00:49:50,487 --> 00:49:52,853
Good luck.

651
00:49:54,524 --> 00:49:56,719
John?

652
00:50:08,905 --> 00:50:11,169
Son of a--

653
00:50:11,208 --> 00:50:14,644
Hey hey hey. we have
to figure something out.

654
00:50:14,678 --> 00:50:17,112
All right. Well.
l know what l gotta do.

655
00:50:17,147 --> 00:50:18,876
We're in a 200-foot
aluminum tube

656
00:50:18,915 --> 00:50:20,883
and we're 30.000
feet in the air.

657
00:50:20,917 --> 00:50:22,942
And any one of those slimy
little pieces of shit

658
00:50:22,986 --> 00:50:25,318
can trip a circuit
or a relay or a hydraulic

659
00:50:25,355 --> 00:50:28,051
and this bird goes down
faster than a Thai hooker.

660
00:50:28,091 --> 00:50:32,323
So my job is to keep LAX informed
on how totally screwed we are.

661
00:50:32,362 --> 00:50:34,125
and then find some way
to keep this mother

662
00:50:34,164 --> 00:50:37,565
in the sky another two hours.
Figure that out.

663
00:50:38,935 --> 00:50:42,496
- Hey hey. where you going?
- Uh. l have to go down.

664
00:50:42,539 --> 00:50:44,700
l have to help
the passengers.

665
00:50:49,146 --> 00:50:51,580
Now there's supposed
to be a doctor aboard. A Dr....

666
00:50:51,615 --> 00:50:54,083
Robert Foster.
Robert Foster!

667
00:50:54,117 --> 00:50:56,483
Wait. here he is.
Here he is. Dr. Robert Foster.

668
00:50:56,520 --> 00:50:59,683
row 11. seat H.

669
00:51:16,606 --> 00:51:18,369
Yeah. Harris.

670
00:51:18,408 --> 00:51:21,070
Um. Sanders is dead.

671
00:51:23,480 --> 00:51:26,506
You know all those goddamn security
scenarios we ran?

672
00:51:26,550 --> 00:51:29,178
Well. l'm smack in the middle of one
we didn't think of.

673
00:51:29,219 --> 00:51:30,743
What the hell
you talking about?

674
00:51:30,787 --> 00:51:33,278
Eddie Kim somehow
managed to fill the plane

675
00:51:33,323 --> 00:51:34,881
with poisonous snakes.

676
00:51:34,925 --> 00:51:38,190
Wait. hold on.
What kind of insane plan is that?

677
00:51:38,228 --> 00:51:39,889
He can't
possibly guarantee

678
00:51:39,930 --> 00:51:41,625
that the snakes
are gonna get to Sean.

679
00:51:41,665 --> 00:51:43,565
Yeah well. he doesn't
have to guarantee it

680
00:51:43,600 --> 00:51:46,228
if he brings
the whole plane down.

681
00:51:49,773 --> 00:51:52,401
Listen up.
Everybody listen up.

682
00:51:52,442 --> 00:51:55,502
l want a crisis team
at LAX. ASAP.

683
00:51:55,545 --> 00:51:58,036
And l need the cargo manifest
for every scrap of freight

684
00:51:58,081 --> 00:52:00,140
on South Pacific Air 1 21.

685
00:52:01,451 --> 00:52:03,316
l can't believe
l'm saying this.

686
00:52:03,353 --> 00:52:06,481
l need the best poisonous snake
expert in this time zone.

687
00:52:06,523 --> 00:52:10,118
And l need him in my ear or at my side
in 20 minutes or less.

688
00:52:10,160 --> 00:52:13,596
Well come on. people. let's go!
Somebody make that happen for me!

689
00:52:13,630 --> 00:52:16,394
Hey. tell surveillance.
don't let Eddie Kim out of their sight.

690
00:52:18,935 --> 00:52:21,802
All right. we have to--
we have to suck out the poison.

691
00:52:21,838 --> 00:52:24,272
- Man. l ain't sucking nothing.
- Okay. l'll do it.

692
00:52:24,307 --> 00:52:26,400
What?! Oh. there'll
be no sucking.

693
00:52:26,443 --> 00:52:28,274
Man. Troy. get this
man away from my ass!

694
00:52:28,311 --> 00:52:30,245
- Are you sure?
- Yeah. yeah. we sure. Thanks. pal.

695
00:52:30,280 --> 00:52:32,544
Okay. sweetheart.
it's gonna be okay.

696
00:52:32,582 --> 00:52:34,379
Oh my God!

697
00:52:38,555 --> 00:52:40,546
Hold my baby. please.

698
00:52:40,590 --> 00:52:42,922
Forget about that.

699
00:52:42,959 --> 00:52:45,052
Do you have any
olive oil on the plane?

700
00:52:45,095 --> 00:52:46,585
- Olive oil? Olive oil.
- Yeah.

701
00:52:46,630 --> 00:52:48,097
- l'm on it.
- Yeah. in a cup!

702
00:52:48,131 --> 00:52:50,122
Okay.

703
00:52:50,167 --> 00:52:52,362
When l was a kid.
whenever we went hiking.

704
00:52:52,402 --> 00:52:55,997
we always carried olive oil and a razor
blade in case of a snake bite.

705
00:52:56,039 --> 00:52:58,098
l need something to cut.

706
00:52:58,141 --> 00:52:59,938
Here you go.

707
00:53:00,977 --> 00:53:04,538
Okay. this--
this will work. yeah.

708
00:53:07,083 --> 00:53:10,211
Okay. oil. So you
swish it in your mouth

709
00:53:10,253 --> 00:53:11,948
to seal it
from the poison.

710
00:53:16,493 --> 00:53:18,120
- Look at Claire. Tommy.
- Look at me. sweetie--

711
00:53:18,161 --> 00:53:19,856
lt's gonna hurt
a little bit. okay?

712
00:53:21,464 --> 00:53:24,524
- Okay. now.
- lt hurts.

713
00:53:24,568 --> 00:53:26,593
You're so brave.

714
00:53:28,705 --> 00:53:30,639
Yeah. it's gonna
be all right. Tommy.

715
00:53:33,476 --> 00:53:35,444
Ow! Ah!

716
00:53:40,917 --> 00:53:43,147
That's what
l'm talking about.

717
00:53:44,521 --> 00:53:47,752
- Good. boy.
- Yeah. l think l got it all.

718
00:53:47,791 --> 00:53:50,487
lt's gonna be okay. Tommy.
You're very. very brave.

719
00:53:51,528 --> 00:53:53,860
Um. l-l got bit too.

720
00:54:04,941 --> 00:54:08,172
- Flynn. what the hell--
- Just sit tight.

721
00:54:08,211 --> 00:54:09,940
l can't. l--

722
00:54:09,980 --> 00:54:11,641
Do you remember the first
thing l ever said to you?

723
00:54:11,681 --> 00:54:12,773
Yes.

724
00:54:12,816 --> 00:54:14,443
So what was the first thing
l ever said to you?

725
00:54:14,484 --> 00:54:15,974
l-l know.
but things have changed.

726
00:54:16,019 --> 00:54:18,544
What was the first thing
l said to you?!

727
00:54:18,588 --> 00:54:21,352
Things have changed!
You have a whole plane full of sna--

728
00:54:21,391 --> 00:54:23,052
God! ''Do as l say.
you live.''

729
00:54:23,093 --> 00:54:25,027
Nothing's changed.

730
00:54:25,061 --> 00:54:27,256
Now l need you to stay
up here by the air phone.

731
00:54:27,297 --> 00:54:29,527
When Agent Harris calls.
you come and get me.

732
00:54:29,566 --> 00:54:31,625
You got it?

733
00:54:32,702 --> 00:54:34,567
Got it.

734
00:54:39,643 --> 00:54:42,339
Hey hey hey! They're getting through
the luggage. here. seriously.

735
00:54:42,379 --> 00:54:43,710
l need some help!

736
00:54:46,783 --> 00:54:48,410
Fire extinguisher!

737
00:55:00,430 --> 00:55:02,898
- Ken!
- Agent Flynn. here.

738
00:55:05,001 --> 00:55:07,595
Weapons-- we have to have weapons.
Where's the silverware?

739
00:55:07,637 --> 00:55:09,832
Well. we don't-- we don't
have any silverware.

740
00:55:09,873 --> 00:55:11,932
All we have is this.

741
00:55:11,975 --> 00:55:15,103
- Sporks?
- Yeah.

742
00:55:16,413 --> 00:55:18,438
Here.

743
00:55:19,549 --> 00:55:21,380
Use that.

744
00:55:24,187 --> 00:55:25,882
His name is
Dr. Stephen Price.

745
00:55:25,922 --> 00:55:28,618
He's-- he's some kind of
hardcore snake specialist.

746
00:55:29,993 --> 00:55:32,120
And customs uses him
as their go-to guy

747
00:55:32,162 --> 00:55:34,892
for any animal
smuggling cases.

748
00:55:34,931 --> 00:55:38,128
- The go-to guy?
- Yeah. So he must be good.

749
00:55:50,280 --> 00:55:51,907
Dr. Price?

750
00:55:51,948 --> 00:55:53,939
- lt is l.
- Hank Harris.

751
00:55:53,983 --> 00:55:56,884
l'm hoping this is important.
l've got baby Antiguan racer eggs

752
00:55:56,920 --> 00:55:59,320
in there ready to hatch--
the first time ever in captivity

753
00:55:59,356 --> 00:56:00,880
- Really?
- lt's very exciting.

754
00:56:00,924 --> 00:56:03,358
Wow. l got another exciting first
l'd like to tell you about.

755
00:56:04,627 --> 00:56:06,458
l need another!
Help. somebody!

756
00:56:08,031 --> 00:56:10,056
Come on!
Help me out here!

757
00:56:10,100 --> 00:56:12,091
- Please. l can't-- l can't do this!
- Hold on. l'm coming!

758
00:56:12,135 --> 00:56:14,569
Come on! Somebody get me another
fire extinguisher!

759
00:56:17,173 --> 00:56:18,868
All right. we we got
less than 90 minutes.

760
00:56:18,908 --> 00:56:22,309
We've already lost over 50 people
and that's including an FBl agent.

761
00:56:22,345 --> 00:56:23,869
Okay.

762
00:56:23,913 --> 00:56:26,040
Look. we've already
contacted local ERs.

763
00:56:26,082 --> 00:56:28,016
Oh. local ERs.

764
00:56:28,051 --> 00:56:31,020
Uh. l don't think you
understand the magnitude

765
00:56:31,054 --> 00:56:33,488
of what you're
dealing with here.

766
00:56:33,523 --> 00:56:35,388
LA County ERs can.
at best.

767
00:56:35,425 --> 00:56:38,258
handle the occasional
snake bite.

768
00:56:38,294 --> 00:56:42,560
Uh. not an entire
7 47 full of them.

769
00:56:42,599 --> 00:56:45,397
l'm going to contact
the National Poison Control Center

770
00:56:45,435 --> 00:56:49,132
to have them alert every ER
in the tri-county area

771
00:56:49,172 --> 00:56:53,040
and to order every available helicopter
crew to be ready.

772
00:56:53,076 --> 00:56:55,704
We've got less than
two hours to mobilize an entire army.

773
00:56:58,081 --> 00:56:59,810
Flynn. Flynn!

774
00:56:59,849 --> 00:57:02,545
Hey. they got-- they got
a snake guy on the phone.

775
00:57:02,585 --> 00:57:05,019
Who the hell is that?

776
00:57:05,054 --> 00:57:07,045
His name is Dr. Price.

777
00:57:09,559 --> 00:57:12,528
Look. Doc. people are dying
up here. We need help fast.

778
00:57:12,562 --> 00:57:15,622
Okay. just break open any blisters
that form around the bites.

779
00:57:15,665 --> 00:57:17,690
- Keep them clean.
- We're doing that.

780
00:57:17,734 --> 00:57:20,794
- lt doesn't seem to be doing much good.
- Snakes don't attack

781
00:57:20,837 --> 00:57:23,237
unless they're
provoked. right?

782
00:57:23,273 --> 00:57:25,434
Something up there
is making them go crazy.

783
00:57:25,475 --> 00:57:27,067
Yeah. no shit.

784
00:57:27,110 --> 00:57:29,601
They're attacking everybody
and everything up here.

785
00:57:29,646 --> 00:57:31,876
They're especially fond
of those fucking leis.

786
00:57:31,915 --> 00:57:34,816
Leis? Jesus.
l don't know. uh...

787
00:57:34,851 --> 00:57:36,682
it could possibly
be a pheromone.

788
00:57:36,719 --> 00:57:39,347
That's what female animals release
to trigger mating behavior.

789
00:57:39,389 --> 00:57:42,358
lt could also provoke
serious hyperaggression.

790
00:57:42,392 --> 00:57:44,519
Like some kind of drug.

791
00:57:44,561 --> 00:57:46,290
Well. that's good news.

792
00:57:46,329 --> 00:57:48,729
Snakes on crack.

793
00:57:48,765 --> 00:57:50,699
How could you imbeciles
let somebody put snakes--

794
00:57:50,733 --> 00:57:52,758
- We need to turn this plane around
- l don't want to die.

795
00:57:52,802 --> 00:57:55,600
- We need to get them to a hospital
- We're almost to LA now.

796
00:57:55,638 --> 00:57:57,162
Know what they call that?
The point of no return.

797
00:57:57,207 --> 00:57:58,731
So this is it?
That's what the plan is?

798
00:57:58,775 --> 00:58:01,335
We sit around here waiting
for the snakes to bite us?

799
00:58:01,377 --> 00:58:04,175
Look. everyone
just calm down. please!

800
00:58:04,214 --> 00:58:05,772
We're doing
the best we can here.

801
00:58:05,815 --> 00:58:08,147
Okay. look. there are hundreds
of species of snakes

802
00:58:08,184 --> 00:58:09,879
with hundreds
of cocktails of venom.

803
00:58:09,919 --> 00:58:11,511
Some will kill you
in two minutes.

804
00:58:11,554 --> 00:58:13,488
others in two hours
and some you can

805
00:58:13,523 --> 00:58:15,889
actually cure with
a good night's rest.

806
00:58:15,925 --> 00:58:17,449
But here's the thing:

807
00:58:17,494 --> 00:58:19,928
lf you administer
the wrong antivenom.

808
00:58:19,963 --> 00:58:21,658
that will kill you.

809
00:58:21,698 --> 00:58:24,223
l am not
a zoologist. man.

810
00:58:24,267 --> 00:58:27,202
l can identify maybe
two of the snakes l've seen up here.

811
00:58:27,237 --> 00:58:28,932
A cobra
and a rattlesnake. okay?

812
00:58:28,972 --> 00:58:30,564
You're going to
have to be more--

813
00:58:30,607 --> 00:58:32,370
much more
specific than that.

814
00:58:32,408 --> 00:58:34,842
Oh. shit.

815
00:58:34,878 --> 00:58:37,312
Um. look. um.

816
00:58:37,347 --> 00:58:39,281
l'll round up all
the dead ones l can find

817
00:58:39,315 --> 00:58:41,340
and-- and l'll call
you back. okay?

818
00:58:41,384 --> 00:58:43,045
Make it fast.
Time is tissue.

819
00:58:43,086 --> 00:58:45,247
Time is t--

820
00:58:47,190 --> 00:58:49,351
l want to know
what's going on.

821
00:58:49,392 --> 00:58:51,257
- Get out of the way!
- No. no! No!

822
00:58:51,294 --> 00:58:52,955
You guys are not
supposed to go up there.

823
00:58:52,996 --> 00:58:55,590
- Move. girl!
- You can't take the stairs!

824
00:59:00,537 --> 00:59:02,471
You can't keep
us down there.

825
00:59:02,505 --> 00:59:04,405
Why exactly are there
snakes on this plane?

826
00:59:04,440 --> 00:59:06,340
- l don't have time to explain.
- Well. you better make time.

827
00:59:06,376 --> 00:59:08,674
You put us at risk
and you're gonna tell us why.

828
00:59:08,711 --> 00:59:12,010
What l'm gonna tell you
is to go back downstairs now.

829
00:59:12,048 --> 00:59:13,538
Man. who the hell
you think you are?

830
00:59:13,583 --> 00:59:15,175
Whoa whoa whoa.
okay. look.

831
00:59:15,218 --> 00:59:17,311
The snakes are
on the plane because...

832
00:59:17,353 --> 00:59:19,446
l'm supposed to testify
tomorrow against Eddie Kim.

833
00:59:19,489 --> 00:59:22,049
Oh. Jesus Christ.
we're all dead.

834
00:59:22,091 --> 00:59:24,059
Not me.

835
00:59:24,093 --> 00:59:26,254
lt's my job to handle
life-and-death situations

836
00:59:26,296 --> 00:59:28,287
on a daily basis.
lt's what l do.

837
00:59:28,331 --> 00:59:30,265
and l'm very good at it.

838
00:59:30,300 --> 00:59:32,359
Now you can stand there
and be the panicked. angry mob

839
00:59:32,402 --> 00:59:35,838
and blame him. me and the government
for getting you into this.

840
00:59:35,872 --> 00:59:37,863
But if you want
to survive tonight.

841
00:59:37,907 --> 00:59:39,772
you need to save
your energy

842
00:59:39,809 --> 00:59:42,004
and start
working together.

843
00:59:42,045 --> 00:59:43,603
Now what we need to do

844
00:59:43,646 --> 00:59:46,672
is go back in there and find
all the dead snakes we can

845
00:59:46,716 --> 00:59:48,308
so the doctors
on the ground

846
00:59:48,351 --> 00:59:50,342
will know what kind
of antivenoms we need.

847
00:59:50,386 --> 00:59:52,479
Whatever you find.
you bring it to me.

848
00:59:52,522 --> 00:59:55,320
And l don't need to tell
you to be careful.

849
00:59:59,295 --> 01:00:01,024
Whoa whoa whoa.
where you going?

850
01:00:01,064 --> 01:00:03,362
l'm going with--
l-l can't just sit here doing nothing.

851
01:00:03,399 --> 01:00:06,334
Remember when you
said it's all about choices we make?

852
01:00:06,369 --> 01:00:08,337
Well. l'm making one.
Don't treat me like a prisoner!

853
01:00:08,371 --> 01:00:09,895
l need you
to stay up here.

854
01:00:09,939 --> 01:00:13,431
- Why?
- Because if you die.

855
01:00:13,476 --> 01:00:16,343
then all this
was for nothing.

856
01:00:16,379 --> 01:00:18,438
Sit your ass down.

857
01:00:18,481 --> 01:00:20,312
We got a snake. man.

858
01:00:47,744 --> 01:00:49,837
Okay. Doc. l got one
here that's. um...

859
01:00:49,879 --> 01:00:53,645
l guess. brownish on top and l'd say
green on the bottom.

860
01:00:53,683 --> 01:00:55,776
Wait a second. pure green?
Or is it blue?

861
01:00:55,818 --> 01:00:58,150
Um. well. if l had to guess.
l'd say green.

862
01:00:58,187 --> 01:01:00,155
No no no. teal.
lt's a deep shade of teal.

863
01:01:00,189 --> 01:01:01,952
lt's-- it's teal. Doc.

864
01:01:01,991 --> 01:01:03,720
Why don't we just
take a picture?

865
01:01:03,760 --> 01:01:06,957
Oh. sure. let's drop it off at Jiffy
Photo when we land. Einstein.

866
01:01:06,996 --> 01:01:08,361
Ever heard of e-mail.
dick-wad?

867
01:01:08,398 --> 01:01:10,059
All we need is a digital camera
and a computer.

868
01:01:10,099 --> 01:01:13,068
Or this.
lt's got both.

869
01:01:13,102 --> 01:01:16,333
Doc. l'm gonna e-mail you
some pictures. all right?

870
01:01:24,580 --> 01:01:27,071
Rick!

871
01:01:27,116 --> 01:01:29,448
Rick?

872
01:01:32,455 --> 01:01:34,082
Rick!

873
01:01:36,092 --> 01:01:38,219
Rick!

874
01:01:42,598 --> 01:01:45,123
Oh. God.

875
01:01:58,681 --> 01:02:00,672
Are we landing?

876
01:02:00,717 --> 01:02:04,380
- There are no lights down there.
- l don't think so.

877
01:02:04,420 --> 01:02:06,445
Doc. photos are
coming to you now.

878
01:02:11,360 --> 01:02:13,453
Everybody.
buckle up now! Now!

879
01:02:13,496 --> 01:02:15,691
Oh my God. no!

880
01:02:19,435 --> 01:02:23,462
- Come on. buckle up. l got you.
- Oh my God!

881
01:02:49,665 --> 01:02:51,292
Fucker!

882
01:02:54,170 --> 01:02:56,138
Hya!

883
01:02:59,142 --> 01:03:01,042
Okay. let's pull
this thing up.

884
01:03:01,077 --> 01:03:03,910
Hula 1-2-1 heavy. you're descending
through 23.000 feet.

885
01:03:03,946 --> 01:03:06,312
There's no time to strap in.
just pull up. pull hard!

886
01:03:06,349 --> 01:03:10,718
Somebody help me!
Somebody help. they're coming through.

887
01:03:15,191 --> 01:03:18,490
Tiffany! Tiffany!

888
01:03:18,528 --> 01:03:20,359
Look out!

889
01:03:22,298 --> 01:03:24,163
- You okay?
- Yeah.

890
01:03:26,702 --> 01:03:29,398
We gotta get the people upstairs.
lt's safer there.

891
01:03:34,443 --> 01:03:37,537
Somebody help me.

892
01:03:37,580 --> 01:03:39,673
Kill them!

893
01:03:41,784 --> 01:03:43,183
Hula 1-2-1. heavy

894
01:03:43,219 --> 01:03:46,586
you're now below 19.000 feet.
Do you copy?

895
01:03:46,622 --> 01:03:49,318
lt's not working.

896
01:03:49,358 --> 01:03:52,088
- l wanna get out.
- Let me get you up.

897
01:03:52,128 --> 01:03:54,426
Get upstairs. come on.

Hurry!

903
01:04:43,312 --> 01:04:47,305
- Out of the way!
- Move your ass. God damn it!

904
01:04:55,725 --> 01:04:57,625
Go. go!

905
01:05:01,764 --> 01:05:04,528
No.

Come on. quicker!

907
01:05:09,705 --> 01:05:11,673

Hurry!

Hang on to me.
l've got you!

911
01:05:29,058 --> 01:05:32,221
Get me off this plane!

912
01:05:41,804 --> 01:05:42,964
Come on!

913
01:05:44,006 --> 01:05:46,133

01:05:46,175 --> 01:05:47,904
Go. quick!

915
01:06:08,064 --> 01:06:09,622
Oh shit!

01:06:09,665 --> 01:06:12,065
Mary Kate!

917
01:06:12,101 --> 01:06:13,728
You animal!

918
01:06:13,769 --> 01:06:17,227
- You animal! l hate you!
- Freakin' dog. lady.

919
01:06:17,273 --> 01:06:19,036
- l hate you!
- Why did you do that?

920
01:06:19,075 --> 01:06:21,737
What? You all would have
done exactly the same thing.

921
01:06:26,582 --> 01:06:28,413
Somebody do something.

922
01:06:28,451 --> 01:06:30,612
Look out!
Oh my God!

923
01:06:54,577 --> 01:06:57,011
Let's go. Hey hey.

924
01:06:57,046 --> 01:06:58,536
- Behind you.
- Come on!

925
01:07:01,684 --> 01:07:04,710
Come on. move move move!
Come on. come on.

926
01:07:08,958 --> 01:07:12,724
We gotta block the stairs.
Grab bags. everyone.

927
01:07:12,762 --> 01:07:14,093
- Come on!
- Pass it down!

928
01:07:18,801 --> 01:07:21,599
Get me NTSB.

929
01:07:21,637 --> 01:07:23,798
And call the Coast Guard.

930
01:07:23,839 --> 01:07:25,807
Hula 1-2-1. heavy.

931
01:07:25,841 --> 01:07:28,901
you are now below
1.000 feet. Pull up.

932
01:07:28,944 --> 01:07:31,469
Pull up!

933
01:07:42,591 --> 01:07:44,149
Oh. my God.

934
01:07:44,193 --> 01:07:47,492
Holy fuck!

935
01:07:49,799 --> 01:07:52,962
Oh. thank God.

936
01:07:53,002 --> 01:07:55,027
Wait a second.
What about the life raft?

937
01:07:55,071 --> 01:07:56,504
- Use this!
- Good idea.

938
01:07:56,539 --> 01:07:59,372
l got it!

939
01:08:01,977 --> 01:08:04,002
Hello. can anybody
hear me?

940
01:08:04,046 --> 01:08:05,911
Hula 1-2-1. heavy.

941
01:08:05,948 --> 01:08:08,109
somebody wanna tell me
what's going on up there?

942
01:08:08,150 --> 01:08:10,710
We've lost our--

943
01:08:13,722 --> 01:08:15,849
Rick.

944
01:08:24,366 --> 01:08:27,199
- Hold. hold. push!
- Come on. hurry!

945
01:08:27,236 --> 01:08:28,828
Kill it.
Kill it!

946
01:08:28,871 --> 01:08:31,032
Here. grab an end!

947
01:08:31,073 --> 01:08:34,065
Oh. Rick.

948
01:08:41,917 --> 01:08:44,852
Hold it. hold it down.
Push it down.

949
01:08:44,887 --> 01:08:48,220
That's great. okay. Get it down.
There you go. There you go.

950
01:08:49,225 --> 01:08:50,886
Don't let anybody down.

951
01:08:52,161 --> 01:08:54,254
Oh. Rick. your arm.

952
01:08:56,499 --> 01:08:58,364
Okay.

953
01:08:58,400 --> 01:09:00,732
There you go.

954
01:09:00,769 --> 01:09:02,532
Oh. yeah.
you know. Claire.

955
01:09:02,571 --> 01:09:04,232
l think l'm gonna need
your shirt. too.

956
01:09:04,273 --> 01:09:07,265
- Oh. Jeez. Very funny.
- Gotta try. right?

957
01:09:07,309 --> 01:09:11,211
Uh. Rick. could you please
engage the autopilot?

958
01:09:11,247 --> 01:09:14,182
Yeah. here. l got it.

959
01:09:19,321 --> 01:09:21,414
Do you think you
can fly with one hand?

960
01:09:21,457 --> 01:09:25,359
Oh. baby. you'd be amazed at what
a man can do with one hand.

961
01:09:26,729 --> 01:09:29,425
All right. l got this.
You go get it.

962
01:09:29,465 --> 01:09:31,057
Do your business.

963
01:09:43,412 --> 01:09:47,075
We. uh. we had no choice.
The snakes were everywhere.

964
01:09:47,116 --> 01:09:48,879
Yeah. okay. l guess you
did what you had to do.

965
01:09:48,918 --> 01:09:50,408
Yeah.

966
01:09:52,922 --> 01:09:55,049
These aren't
North American snakes.

967
01:09:55,090 --> 01:09:57,888
So what? What does it matter?
Let's just get the antivenom

968
01:09:57,927 --> 01:10:00,020
- and take it to the airport.
- No no no. these snakes aren't even

969
01:10:00,062 --> 01:10:02,496
from this continent.
They're from all over the globe.

970
01:10:02,531 --> 01:10:04,499
Only a handful
of US hospitals

971
01:10:04,533 --> 01:10:06,558
even carry
foreign antivenom.

972
01:10:09,171 --> 01:10:11,071
- How long?
- How long what?

973
01:10:11,106 --> 01:10:13,131
- How long to get the antivenom here?
- l don't know.

974
01:10:13,175 --> 01:10:15,336
At least a day.
maybe two.

975
01:10:15,377 --> 01:10:17,436
What do we do?

976
01:10:17,479 --> 01:10:20,107
l don't know if there's anything
we can do.

977
01:10:26,689 --> 01:10:29,954
What are you drawing
there. sweetie?

978
01:10:31,594 --> 01:10:34,961
Oh. wow.
that's really good.

979
01:10:37,132 --> 01:10:39,566
l'm really sorry
about your dog.

980
01:10:41,303 --> 01:10:42,964
Thanks.

981
01:10:44,406 --> 01:10:46,237
What's up. buddy?

982
01:10:47,843 --> 01:10:51,745
Trying to get this guy to slam
the basketball. He just won't do it.

983
01:10:51,780 --> 01:10:55,546
Last month they offered
early retirement.

984
01:10:57,386 --> 01:10:59,513
But no.

985
01:10:59,555 --> 01:11:02,752
this broad needed
one more tour of duty.

986
01:11:02,791 --> 01:11:06,158
You were here
for a reason.

987
01:11:06,195 --> 01:11:08,129
You saved my baby.

988
01:11:08,163 --> 01:11:10,631
That's a pretty
good reason.

989
01:11:15,404 --> 01:11:18,271
Hey. it's too--
Flynn. it's too hot.

990
01:11:18,307 --> 01:11:20,275
l'm from Tennessee.
l hadn't noticed.

991
01:11:20,309 --> 01:11:22,072
Anyway. heat's the least
of our worries.

992
01:11:22,111 --> 01:11:24,238
No no no.
listen. listen.

993
01:11:24,280 --> 01:11:26,441
The air's not recycling.

994
01:11:26,482 --> 01:11:28,177
He's right.

995
01:11:28,217 --> 01:11:30,913
lf there's no air conditioning it's
gonna get too hard to breathe.

996
01:11:30,953 --> 01:11:33,615
Shit!

997
01:11:33,656 --> 01:11:35,419
Okay.
how about the zoos?

998
01:11:35,457 --> 01:11:37,755
How about the zoos?
l mean. zoos got snakes. right?

999
01:11:37,793 --> 01:11:39,693
So they must have
antivenom there.

1000
01:11:39,728 --> 01:11:42,629
We would need a detailed list
of every species involved.

1001
01:11:42,665 --> 01:11:44,132
with that exact number.

1002
01:11:44,166 --> 01:11:48,569
And an exotic shipment like this would
only come through a dealer. So...

1003
01:11:48,604 --> 01:11:50,196
All right. well. who
in Hawaii would do that?

1004
01:11:50,239 --> 01:11:53,970
And no one in Hawaii. because snakes
aren't indigenous to Hawaii.

1005
01:11:54,009 --> 01:11:56,204
But Eddie Kim lives
in LA.

1006
01:11:57,746 --> 01:11:59,714
Could he have
shopped locally?

1007
01:11:59,748 --> 01:12:03,479
Yes. only one guy could arrange this
many illegal snakes.

1008
01:12:03,519 --> 01:12:05,487
He lives out
in the desert.

1009
01:12:05,521 --> 01:12:07,614
Take us
to the heliport.

1010
01:12:07,656 --> 01:12:09,920
You don't think l know
it's hotter than hell in here?

1011
01:12:12,127 --> 01:12:15,528
We also have abnormal
vibrations in engines one and two.

1012
01:12:15,564 --> 01:12:19,022
l had no choice
but to throttle back.

1013
01:12:19,068 --> 01:12:21,161
- You slowed down?
- Yeah.

1014
01:12:21,203 --> 01:12:23,171
Well. you know.

1015
01:12:23,205 --> 01:12:27,141
- lt's that or option B.
- Which is?

1016
01:12:27,176 --> 01:12:29,610
l go faster
and the engines seize up;

1017
01:12:29,645 --> 01:12:31,670
We eventually plummet

1018
01:12:31,714 --> 01:12:33,614
to a horrible death;

1019
01:12:33,649 --> 01:12:37,016
They spend the next year
identifying femurs.

1020
01:12:38,020 --> 01:12:40,147
Okay. so just tell me

1021
01:12:40,189 --> 01:12:42,214
how to get
the AC back on.

1022
01:12:42,257 --> 01:12:46,921
We've lost power
to the outflow valve motor.

1023
01:12:46,962 --> 01:12:50,398
- Which is where?
- Well. you gotta reset it manually.

1024
01:12:50,432 --> 01:12:53,230
The breaker's down
in the cargo hold.

1025
01:12:53,268 --> 01:12:56,260
Yeah.

1026
01:12:56,305 --> 01:12:58,569
Sucks to be you
right now.

1027
01:12:59,742 --> 01:13:01,437
Get off me. man!

1028
01:13:01,477 --> 01:13:03,968
l told y'all stop touching on me
and coughing on me.

1029
01:13:04,012 --> 01:13:07,413
lt's disgusting up in here.
Stay away from me.

1030
01:13:09,785 --> 01:13:11,810
Yo. how come there's no air coming
out of this piece of junk?

1031
01:13:11,854 --> 01:13:13,515
How come there's no air
coming out of here?

1032
01:13:13,555 --> 01:13:16,217
Only lasts about 10 minutes after
they deploy. Now please. l need--

1033
01:13:16,258 --> 01:13:18,123
Please nothing.
Get out of my face. man.

1034
01:13:18,160 --> 01:13:20,094
- lf you could please just take a seat.
- Back away from me. man.

1035
01:13:20,129 --> 01:13:21,960
- You sit down. Back away from me.
- Whoa whoa whoa.

1036
01:13:21,997 --> 01:13:24,989
Back away from me.
Get up off me. man. Back up off me.

1037
01:13:25,033 --> 01:13:26,500
Hey hey hey hey.

1038
01:13:26,535 --> 01:13:28,400
l gotta get off
this plane. man.

1039
01:13:28,437 --> 01:13:30,132
- l'm sick of this bullshit.
- Listen. brother. you got to chill.

1040
01:13:30,172 --> 01:13:32,140
- Look. just get a grip. all right?
- You get a grip. man.

1041
01:13:32,174 --> 01:13:33,732
You get-- get...

1042
01:13:33,776 --> 01:13:36,506
Hey. back up.
back up. Back up!

1043
01:13:36,545 --> 01:13:39,480
That gun goes off
in this pressurized cabin. we all die.

1044
01:13:39,515 --> 01:13:41,506
Well you know what?
l want some air.

1045
01:13:41,550 --> 01:13:43,541
- What's the matter with you. Clarence?
- What's the matter with you?

1046
01:13:43,585 --> 01:13:45,075
No. what's the matter
with you. man?

1047
01:13:45,120 --> 01:13:48,886
Hey. look. you know we go back to when
we were kids. all right?

1048
01:13:48,924 --> 01:13:51,484
But l don't even
recognize you right now.

1049
01:13:51,527 --> 01:13:53,654
waving a gun at all these
innocent women and children.

1050
01:13:53,695 --> 01:13:56,755
Man. there's a baby
right over there. man.

1051
01:13:56,799 --> 01:14:00,530
We're all in trouble here. dawg.
This ain't just about you.

1052
01:14:00,569 --> 01:14:03,163
Sit your ass down.
Clarence.

1053
01:14:03,205 --> 01:14:05,571
Whatever. man.

1054
01:14:11,113 --> 01:14:12,478
lt's the snakes!

1055
01:14:12,514 --> 01:14:15,142
Shoot. Now what?

1056
01:14:17,152 --> 01:14:19,382
Breathe deep.

1057
01:14:22,291 --> 01:14:24,486
Oh. God. Grace.

1058
01:15:04,633 --> 01:15:05,691
Claire.

1059
01:15:08,070 --> 01:15:10,095
Claire.

1060
01:15:20,482 --> 01:15:22,643
l need you
to be strong.

1061
01:15:27,890 --> 01:15:29,949
Come on.

1062
01:15:29,992 --> 01:15:33,257
- Let's go get these people some air.
- Okay.

1063
01:15:55,217 --> 01:15:56,707
See this?

1064
01:15:57,986 --> 01:16:00,477
l went through
a pyromaniac phase as a kid.

1065
01:16:00,522 --> 01:16:03,047
- Here.
- You too. huh?

1066
01:16:03,091 --> 01:16:05,753
Anything else l should
know about you?

1067
01:16:05,794 --> 01:16:08,194
Let me go with you. You don't know
your way around down there.

1068
01:16:08,230 --> 01:16:10,858
No. l need you up here.
You're my eyes and ears.

1069
01:16:10,899 --> 01:16:13,527
Call me.

1070
01:16:13,569 --> 01:16:15,537
Be back
soon as l can.

1071
01:16:15,571 --> 01:16:19,007
- You'd better. Be careful.
- Yeah.

1072
01:16:37,059 --> 01:16:39,027
Okay. l'm here.

1073
01:16:39,061 --> 01:16:42,030
Okay. the EAP panel
should be on your right.

1074
01:17:11,326 --> 01:17:14,090
Okay. here l go.

1075
01:17:48,030 --> 01:17:50,089
Hey. how's your boy?

1076
01:17:50,132 --> 01:17:52,623
l don't know. man.
He's in a lot of pain.

1077
01:17:54,803 --> 01:17:57,863
- Here. man. take some of this water.
- Thank you.

1078
01:17:59,307 --> 01:18:01,002
- Hey.
- Hey.

1079
01:18:01,043 --> 01:18:04,444
- Hey. you got any water?
- Sure. yeah.

1080
01:18:04,479 --> 01:18:06,242
Thanks.

1081
01:18:06,281 --> 01:18:08,875
Look. l'm not really good at this whole
apologizing thing.

1082
01:18:08,917 --> 01:18:11,943
but l'm sorry
about pushing you.

1083
01:18:11,987 --> 01:18:14,046
lt's all right.

1084
01:18:14,089 --> 01:18:16,523
You too. man.

1085
01:18:16,558 --> 01:18:18,549
That's-- that's--
that's my bad.

1086
01:18:20,195 --> 01:18:21,753
Okay. it's okay.

1087
01:18:34,443 --> 01:18:36,741
Oh...

1088
01:18:36,778 --> 01:18:39,440
looks like somebody
rigged this. uh...

1089
01:18:39,481 --> 01:18:40,914
access panel door

1090
01:18:40,949 --> 01:18:43,179
to stay open
so the snakes could get out.

1091
01:18:43,218 --> 01:18:45,049
Be careful.

1092
01:18:45,087 --> 01:18:48,716
All right. so where's
this outflow breaker panel

1093
01:18:48,757 --> 01:18:50,384
you were talking about?

1094
01:18:50,425 --> 01:18:52,791
Oh. it's in the very
next compartment.

1095
01:19:15,617 --> 01:19:18,518
Shit!

1096
01:19:18,553 --> 01:19:21,147
- What's going on?
- The goddamn lever's stuck.

1097
01:19:22,457 --> 01:19:24,357
Ooh. hey!

1098
01:19:40,809 --> 01:19:43,107
Flynn. are you okay?

1099
01:19:43,145 --> 01:19:45,204
Yeah.

1100
01:20:18,280 --> 01:20:22,239
- Oh! Oh...
- Yes!

1101
01:20:22,284 --> 01:20:24,582
Okay. well.
that's a good sign.

1102
01:20:26,655 --> 01:20:29,180
Shh!

1103
01:20:29,224 --> 01:20:31,556
Do you guys
hear that?

1104
01:21:11,333 --> 01:21:13,563
Kreitler's been busted
twice by customs

1105
01:21:13,602 --> 01:21:17,129
for possession of illegal snakes.
There he is. That's him.

1106
01:21:20,775 --> 01:21:23,243
Down. down!

1107
01:21:24,646 --> 01:21:26,273
Get the door.

1108
01:21:26,314 --> 01:21:28,782
- What are you doing?
- My job.

1109
01:22:17,732 --> 01:22:20,826
Area's secure.
Send in Dr. Price now.

1110
01:22:24,706 --> 01:22:27,470
Wow. that's gonna
leave a mark.

1111
01:22:30,845 --> 01:22:32,278
That's a desert
blacksnake.

1112
01:22:32,314 --> 01:22:36,478
That's indigenous
to the Middle East.

1113
01:22:36,518 --> 01:22:39,146
- Looks like you can use some antivenom.
- ln the fridge.

1114
01:22:39,187 --> 01:22:41,155
- Hurry!
- Ooh. hurry.

1115
01:22:41,189 --> 01:22:44,556
The Middle East.
Correct me if l'm wrong. Dr. Price.

1116
01:22:44,592 --> 01:22:46,150
but that would make
that snake illegal. wouldn't it?

1117
01:22:46,194 --> 01:22:47,889
Yes. yes. it would.

1118
01:22:47,929 --> 01:22:49,897
How long does that give
Mr. Mullet here to live?

1119
01:22:49,931 --> 01:22:53,799
l would say
about seven minutes.

1120
01:22:53,835 --> 01:22:57,532
Seven minutes. huh?
All right. listen to me.

1121
01:22:57,572 --> 01:23:00,336
Hey. l would love
to do this whole dance. you know.

1122
01:23:00,375 --> 01:23:02,866
take a nuanced approach to interrogating
you. but the truth of it is.

1123
01:23:02,911 --> 01:23:04,811
l don't have time
to be subtle.

1124
01:23:04,846 --> 01:23:07,679
l want a list of every snake
on that plane.

1125
01:23:07,716 --> 01:23:09,911
You got less
than seven minutes.

1126
01:23:09,951 --> 01:23:12,249
On the clipboard.

1127
01:23:12,287 --> 01:23:14,448
- The clipboard!
- Hang on to that.

1128
01:23:16,758 --> 01:23:19,750
- ls that every snake on that plane?
- Yes.

1129
01:23:19,794 --> 01:23:21,921
- Did Eddie Kim pay you to do this?
- Yes!

1130
01:23:21,963 --> 01:23:23,692
Look. give me the shot.
God damn it.

1131
01:23:23,732 --> 01:23:25,757
What are you gonna
do. call the ACLU?

1132
01:23:25,800 --> 01:23:28,667
How'd you get these guys to be so
aggressive. that's what l'm wondering.

1133
01:23:28,703 --> 01:23:30,034
l don't know what
you're talking about.

1134
01:23:30,071 --> 01:23:31,698
Hey.

1135
01:23:31,740 --> 01:23:33,970
You're wasting it!

1136
01:23:34,009 --> 01:23:36,910
Pheromones. We sprayed
the flowers with it.

1137
01:23:36,945 --> 01:23:39,641
so it would circulate
in the plane's air system.

1138
01:23:39,681 --> 01:23:43,310
l swear to God.
That's it.

1139
01:23:50,425 --> 01:23:53,417
Okay.
All right.

1140
01:23:55,764 --> 01:23:58,028
Bring in Eddie Kim. Charge him
with multiple counts of murder

1141
01:23:58,066 --> 01:24:01,365
and attempted murder and get that
piece-of-shit attorney on the phone.

1142
01:24:01,403 --> 01:24:03,894
Yeah. tell him to ask Kim
what his preference is.

1143
01:24:03,938 --> 01:24:06,566
Gas or lethal injection.

1144
01:24:15,850 --> 01:24:18,045
Oh. thank God.

1145
01:24:19,454 --> 01:24:22,355
Flynn. it's Harris.

1146
01:24:27,662 --> 01:24:29,960
- Thank you. Thank you.
- Yeah.

1147
01:24:29,998 --> 01:24:33,195
Yeah.

1148
01:24:33,234 --> 01:24:36,101
Outstanding.
All right.

1149
01:24:36,137 --> 01:24:39,072
Everybody. listen.
they have the antivenom.

1150
01:24:39,107 --> 01:24:42,076
lt's gonna be waiting
for us when we land in LA.

1151
01:24:42,110 --> 01:24:45,409
Hear that. little man?
Your brother's gonna be fine.

1152
01:24:46,815 --> 01:24:48,976
lt's all up
to the pilot now.

1153
01:24:49,017 --> 01:24:51,508
l'll go give him
the good news.

1154
01:24:51,553 --> 01:24:53,578
Rick.

1155
01:24:53,621 --> 01:24:55,714
Rick.

1156
01:24:55,757 --> 01:24:58,419
Rick. open the door.

1157
01:24:58,460 --> 01:25:00,690
What's going on?

1158
01:25:00,728 --> 01:25:03,390
He's not answering.

1159
01:25:03,431 --> 01:25:05,160
Rick!

1160
01:25:15,743 --> 01:25:17,643
- Ho!
- Oh my God!

1161
01:25:19,647 --> 01:25:21,911
Get him up!

1162
01:25:29,824 --> 01:25:32,190
Uh...

1163
01:25:32,227 --> 01:25:34,195
l can't believe
l'm gonna say this:

1164
01:25:34,229 --> 01:25:36,857
ls there anyone here
who knows how

1165
01:25:36,898 --> 01:25:39,128
to fly a plane?

1166
01:25:39,167 --> 01:25:40,896
Claire. Claire. l'll do it.

1167
01:25:40,935 --> 01:25:42,425
l'm sure the tower
can talk me through it.

1168
01:25:42,470 --> 01:25:45,871
No no no. Flynn.
l know who could land this plane.

1169
01:25:45,907 --> 01:25:48,034
- Who?
- Him.

1170
01:25:49,577 --> 01:25:51,067
Yeah. you.
Come on. Troy.

1171
01:25:51,112 --> 01:25:53,080
You know you can

1172
01:25:53,114 --> 01:25:55,674
Come on.
take us home. dawg.

1173
01:25:55,717 --> 01:25:57,082
You know how to fly?

1174
01:25:57,118 --> 01:25:58,847
Hey. man.

1175
01:25:58,887 --> 01:26:01,617
l got over
2.000 hours.

1176
01:26:01,656 --> 01:26:03,886
This is all you've
talked about.

1177
01:26:03,925 --> 01:26:06,120
Troy. you can do this.

1178
01:26:06,161 --> 01:26:08,026
Yeah yeah yeah.

1179
01:26:08,062 --> 01:26:10,087
Yeah. l can do this.

1180
01:26:11,432 --> 01:26:12,899
We gotta clear the snakes
out of the cockpit.

1181
01:26:12,934 --> 01:26:14,925
Yeah yeah. clear the snakes
out of the cockpit. yeah.

1182
01:26:16,604 --> 01:26:18,572
Enough is enough!

1183
01:26:18,606 --> 01:26:21,200
l have had it with these
motherfucking snakes

1184
01:26:21,242 --> 01:26:23,710
on this
motherfucking plane!

1185
01:26:23,745 --> 01:26:25,906
Everybody strap in.

1186
01:26:25,947 --> 01:26:28,472
l'm about to open
some fucking windows!

1187
01:26:44,232 --> 01:26:46,029
Take this.

1188
01:26:46,067 --> 01:26:49,059
Tie it
to the cockpit door.

1189
01:26:50,205 --> 01:26:52,332
Let's go.

1190
01:27:06,321 --> 01:27:08,789
Listen. when the windows
go out. the cabin's gonna lose pressure

1191
01:27:08,823 --> 01:27:10,950
and oxygen. You gotta get us down
as fast as you can.

1192
01:27:10,992 --> 01:27:12,789
All right.
everybody make sure

1193
01:27:12,827 --> 01:27:15,057
you're strapped in
as securely as possible.

1194
01:27:15,096 --> 01:27:17,064
Remember.
it's going to be loud.

1195
01:27:17,098 --> 01:27:19,293
and it's going to
be cold.

1196
01:27:19,334 --> 01:27:21,859
Hold your breath
as long as you can. all right?

1197
01:27:21,903 --> 01:27:24,428
And protect your head.
Use your arms.

1198
01:27:24,472 --> 01:27:26,099
ls everybody ready?

1199
01:27:26,140 --> 01:27:28,608

One. two.

Let's go!

1205
01:28:36,678 --> 01:28:38,908
Hit that autopilot switch
for me.

1206
01:28:42,750 --> 01:28:45,719
Whoo. whoo! That's what l'm
talking about. boy!

1207
01:28:45,753 --> 01:28:49,086
This shit is bananas!

1208
01:29:08,876 --> 01:29:11,811
Hold on!
Hold on!

Okay.

1213
01:29:48,750 --> 01:29:51,310
You okay?

1214
01:29:56,824 --> 01:29:59,292
Troy. the plane's not level.
lt's not level!

1215
01:29:59,327 --> 01:30:03,263
Yeah yeah. l know that the plane
is not level. okay okay?

1216
01:30:04,332 --> 01:30:05,959
Gimme a break. man.

1217

All right. wassup?
Wassup. y'all?

1218
01:30:10,705 --> 01:30:12,400
What it is.
What it is!

1219
01:30:12,440 --> 01:30:15,500
This is your new pilot Troy speaking.
and sitting next to me

1220
01:30:15,543 --> 01:30:18,876
is my main man.
my brother from another mother.

1221
01:30:18,913 --> 01:30:22,246
the biggest pimp
that l know. Superfly Agent Flynn.

1222
01:30:22,283 --> 01:30:24,183
Ladies and gentlemen.
Agent Flynn.

1223
01:30:27,889 --> 01:30:31,655
Sir. have you got any experience
piloting a jet aircraft?

1224
01:30:31,692 --> 01:30:34,752
Oh. yeah. F-15s.
F-16s.

1225
01:30:34,796 --> 01:30:36,696
A-10 Warthogs.
l've flown all that shit.

1226
01:30:36,731 --> 01:30:39,063
Then we're all thankful
to have you. sir.

1227
01:30:39,100 --> 01:30:42,536
- What squadron were you with?
- The Awesome Fighting Aces.

1228
01:30:42,570 --> 01:30:44,538
Man. l'm telling you.
them video gamers

1229
01:30:44,572 --> 01:30:46,870
got their shit
locked down tight.

1230
01:30:46,908 --> 01:30:48,876
Sir. are you
telling me

1231
01:30:48,910 --> 01:30:50,878
that your only real
flight time is

1232
01:30:50,912 --> 01:30:52,812
at the controls
of a video game?

1233
01:30:52,847 --> 01:30:54,838
No. see.

1234
01:30:54,882 --> 01:30:57,874
it's-- it's not a video game. all right?
lt's a flight simulator.

1235
01:30:57,919 --> 01:31:01,650
- ls that a PlayStation or Xbox?
- PlayStation 2.

1236
01:31:01,689 --> 01:31:04,317
Man. it's got an introduction by
Chuck Yeager and everything.

1237
01:31:04,358 --> 01:31:07,452
Look. Flynn. man.
l can do this.

1238
01:31:07,495 --> 01:31:10,191
Trust me.

1239
01:31:10,231 --> 01:31:12,290
Look. LAX. just give
me my VOR numbers

1240
01:31:12,333 --> 01:31:14,392
and my approach vectors.
and l'll be fine.

1241
01:31:14,435 --> 01:31:17,495
Sir. l suggest you relinquish
the pilot's chair

1242
01:31:17,538 --> 01:31:20,371
to someone more
experienced.

1243
01:31:20,408 --> 01:31:22,706
This is Agent
Neville Flynn. FBl.

1244
01:31:22,743 --> 01:31:25,177
You are talking
to the only person

1245
01:31:25,213 --> 01:31:26,874
up here who has
that experience.

1246
01:31:26,914 --> 01:31:28,882
l suggest you give him
what he needs

1247
01:31:28,916 --> 01:31:31,009
so we can
land this thing.

1248
01:31:31,052 --> 01:31:33,020
Oh!

1249
01:31:33,054 --> 01:31:35,079
Oh!

1250
01:31:35,122 --> 01:31:38,182
So. uh. you are
pretty good at this game. right?

1251
01:31:38,226 --> 01:31:40,558
Yes. man.
No problem.

1252
01:31:40,595 --> 01:31:43,189
Well. l mean. my older brother Randy
has got the high score.

1253
01:31:43,231 --> 01:31:44,926
but l'm good.

1254
01:31:44,966 --> 01:31:48,766
Asshole never lets me
hear the end of it.

1255
01:31:48,803 --> 01:31:51,237
LAX tower.
this is Hula 1-2-1.

1256
01:31:51,272 --> 01:31:54,139
Requesting clearance for landing.
Please advice which runway.

1257
01:31:54,175 --> 01:31:55,972
Hula 1-2-1. heavy.

1258
01:31:56,010 --> 01:31:58,103
we're in the process
of clearing all the runways.

1259
01:31:58,145 --> 01:32:00,170
but you got a strong tailwind.
Advise. come around

1260
01:32:00,214 --> 01:32:02,239
and use runway
2-4-left.

1261
01:32:02,283 --> 01:32:04,615
No no no. negative. tower.

1262

l don't have time
for westbound orientation.

1263
01:32:06,954 --> 01:32:08,945
Look. l got a lot
of injured passengers up here

1264
01:32:08,990 --> 01:32:10,958
who need help
immediately.

1265
01:32:10,992 --> 01:32:14,257
You try to land west to east.
you'll come in too fast to control.

1266
01:32:14,295 --> 01:32:16,456
Well. then l suggest you
speed up clearing the rest

1267
01:32:16,497 --> 01:32:19,227
of the runways. 'cause my ass
is coming in for a landing!

reset and start the level over.

1275
01:33:09,216 --> 01:33:11,150
Oh. shit. left!

01:33:57,331 --> 01:33:58,798
Hell. yeah!

1283

Whose house is this?
Troy's house. that's right.

1284
01:34:01,836 --> 01:34:03,929

He needs oxygen

1298
01:35:34,895 --> 01:35:37,591
Did anyone see the snake

What the fuck's that got

1336
01:38:33,874 --> 01:38:36,468
What was the first thing

01:42:26,039 --> 01:42:27,529
Come on. bring it

1412
01:42:27,574 --> 01:42:29,439
Oh. l'm ready for it

1413
01:42:29,476 --> 01:42:30,875
Come on. bring it

1414
01:42:30,911 --> 01:42:32,674
Oh. l'm ready for it

1415
01:42:32,713 --> 01:42:35,238
Come on. bring it.

1416
01:42:35,282 --> 01:42:38,979
We seem to be losing altitude
at an alarming pace.

1417
01:42:39,019 --> 01:42:41,317
From midtown
to downtown.

1418
01:42:41,355 --> 01:42:43,755
snakes on a block.

1419
01:42:43,790 --> 01:42:45,883
l suggest you grab
your ankles

1420
01:42:45,926 --> 01:42:47,917
and kiss
your ass goodbye.

1421
01:42:54,201 --> 01:42:57,136
That visibly a vagabond

1422
01:42:57,171 --> 01:42:58,900
Yeah. just tag along

1423
01:42:58,939 --> 01:43:00,668
Not one single care
in the world

1424
01:43:00,707 --> 01:43:02,572
Not even any carry on

1425
01:43:02,609 --> 01:43:04,167
They say there's
a future ahead so

1426
01:43:04,211 --> 01:43:05,906
l wanna fly out there
and see

1427
01:43:05,946 --> 01:43:07,777
l just smiled
and said hello

1428
01:43:07,814 --> 01:43:09,611
And sat right next
to Destiny

1429
01:43:09,650 --> 01:43:11,618
l leaned over
and asked him

1430
01:43:11,652 --> 01:43:13,347
Would we be okay?

1431
01:43:13,387 --> 01:43:16,015
He said that he wasn't
at liberty to say

1432
01:43:16,056 --> 01:43:20,516
Send me an angel.
an angel

1433
01:43:20,561 --> 01:43:23,860
The sign of the times.
he said. but take it in vain

1434
01:43:23,897 --> 01:43:27,594
l'm no stranger
to danger

1435
01:43:27,634 --> 01:43:29,397
But l'm scared
'cause l swore

1436
01:43:29,436 --> 01:43:31,404
l saw a snake
on the plane

1437
01:43:31,438 --> 01:43:34,066
l'm tired of these
motherfucking snakes

1438
01:43:34,107 --> 01:43:36,098
On this motherfucking
plane

1439
01:43:36,143 --> 01:43:38,577
l'm tired. l'm tired.
l'm tired

1440
01:43:38,612 --> 01:43:41,080
l'm tired of these
motherfucking snakes

1441
01:43:41,114 --> 01:43:43,014
On this
motherfucking plane

1442
01:43:43,050 --> 01:43:45,450
l'm tired. l'm tired.
l'm tired

1443
01:43:45,485 --> 01:43:49,353
Send me an angel.
an angel

1444
01:43:49,389 --> 01:43:52,825
The sign of the times.
he said. but take it in vain

1445
01:43:52,859 --> 01:43:56,317
l'm no stranger
to danger

1446
01:43:56,363 --> 01:43:58,228
But l'm scared
'cause l swore

1447
01:43:58,265 --> 01:44:00,756
l saw a snake
on the plane.

1448
01:44:23,824 --> 01:44:26,418
Snakes on the brain

1449
01:44:26,460 --> 01:44:27,859
Don't throw up signs

1450
01:44:27,894 --> 01:44:30,488
That don't land planes

1451
01:44:30,530 --> 01:44:31,895
lt's a risky game

1452
01:44:31,932 --> 01:44:34,366
You don't want
us to play

1453
01:44:34,401 --> 01:44:36,301
l hate the player

1454
01:44:36,336 --> 01:44:38,804
And l hate the game

1455
01:44:38,839 --> 01:44:41,501
'Cause it's nature's
game

1456
01:44:42,776 --> 01:44:45,301
You've got
to let it go

1457
01:44:45,345 --> 01:44:47,313
You've got to let it go

1458
01:44:47,347 --> 01:44:49,838
All your fantasies

1459
01:44:49,883 --> 01:44:51,783
Will fuck you up

1460
01:44:51,818 --> 01:44:53,979
Don't let the snakes
coil up

1461
01:44:54,021 --> 01:44:56,353
Around your neck

1462
01:44:56,390 --> 01:44:58,654
Before you land
the plane

1463
01:44:58,692 --> 01:45:01,855
Before you win
the game

1464
01:45:09,102 --> 01:45:11,798
Snakes on the brain

1465
01:45:13,707 --> 01:45:16,301
Snakes on the brain

1466
01:45:18,278 --> 01:45:20,838
Snakes on the brain.
