In ancient times the world was immersed
into darkness and chaos.

North Africa, in 1600.

3
00:00:03,260 --> 00:00:05,980
These were the days of witchcraft and black magic.

4
00:00:05,980 --> 00:00:10,020
Times when no one came against evil.

5
00:01:59,540 --> 00:02:01,740
Where is the throne room?

6
00:02:12,620 --> 00:02:14,060
Hush, sir!

00:02:14,060 --> 00:02:16,340

That's nice!
Honest fellow.

13

- Shut up, dog!

Do not scatter!

The captain is the devil prowls!
I'm feeling!

Do not disperse, I said!

21
00:04:30,220 --> 00:04:33,340
There is only one devil - I!

22
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:41,460
So ...

23
00:04:41,460 --> 00:04:43,620
All for me!

You?

I - the devil reaper.

30
00:07:16,380 --> 00:07:21,620
I came here for you, Solomon Kane!

31
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:28,820
- Your transaction took place!
- You're lying, I'm not concluded any deals!

32

Conclude Kane.

33
00:07:32,740 --> 00:07:36,340
And the stakes - your soul!

34
00:07:36,340 --> 00:07:43,100
Your life is over greedy killers.

35
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:45,460
You do not take my soul!

36
00:07:45,460 --> 00:07:49,420
Bend down to me, Solomon Kane!

37

The devil does not forgive the debts!

Tell your master that I have

You will never take my soul!

Never!

You do not get away from us ...

Solomon?

48
00:09:28,940 --> 00:09:30,900
Who was this novice?

49
00:09:32,260 --> 00:09:35,900
This - brother Thomas. He came to us
few days ago.

50
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:41,700
And these signs really guard
you from the demonic ...

51
00:09:41,740 --> 00:09:44,340
Do not you dare mention it in a holy place!

52
00:09:45,380 --> 00:09:48,220
I must talk with Solomon.

53
00:09:50,740 --> 00:09:54,060
Once again, we heard your cries during matins.

54
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:59,980
This is a dream. Vision does not leave me.

55
00:09:59,980 --> 00:10:03,700
It would be worth to pay attention to the fact
that your dreams tell you.

56
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:05,780
I listened to them.

57
00:10:06,780 --> 00:10:10,660
Night after night my dreams say that I am cursed.

58
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:16,100
God protects his flock. But I
not belong to her!

59
00:10:17,260 --> 00:10:19,100
Right?

60
00:10:21,340 --> 00:10:23,500
My enemies are watching ...

61
00:10:24,820 --> 00:10:26,740
... for me ceaselessly.

62
00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:30,100
And one more thing, this monastery ...

63
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:34,620
This monastery, prayers, symbols ...

64
00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:41,060
That's all that hides me from his gaze.

65
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:43,860
Solomon ...

66
00:10:45,060 --> 00:10:51,420
All these months that you spent here,
I felt like we covers the shadow.

67
00:10:51,420 --> 00:10:53,980
Yes, dark times now.

68
00:10:53,980 --> 00:10:59,020
I inquired of the Lord, and He answered ...

69
00:11:00,980 --> 00:11:04,860
Solomon, you must leave us.

70
00:11:04,860 --> 00:11:07,220
But how?

71
00:11:07,220 --> 00:11:11,020
I live here in solitude ...

72
00:11:11,020 --> 00:11:13,540
Not cause harm.

73
00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:18,660
I came down with a vicious circle, left the power ...

74
00:11:18,660 --> 00:11:21,740
I am learning to be a man of peace!

75
00:11:21,740 --> 00:11:26,260
I know this is so. But your future
not with us, not here.

76
00:11:26,260 --> 00:11:28,860
What are you talking about?

77
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:33,700
I did give all their wealth the church!

78
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:38,980
And we thank you for your generosity,
but me you must understand.

79
00:11:38,980 --> 00:11:40,060
Padre!

80
00:11:41,620 --> 00:11:45,940
Please do not force you to plead.

81
00:11:48,060 --> 00:11:52,260
In this monastery, I found a safe haven.

82
00:11:56,140 --> 00:11:59,940
- And do not go away.
- You will go home.

83
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:04,220
Home?

84
00:12:04,220 --> 00:12:05,220
You the Honorable Sir, you have the land.

85
00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:09,020
Come back in their possession!

86
00:12:09,020 --> 00:12:10,340
No.

- No!

88
00:12:12,820 --> 00:12:15,340
I never go home.

But you can not stay!

90
00:12:47,180 --> 00:12:50,040
I heard a voice in a dream,
called me to send him.

91
00:12:50,420 --> 00:12:55,020
- I always listen to the voices.
- Did Solomon his appointment?

92
00:12:56,260 --> 00:12:58,980
Everyone he knows his fate.

93
00:12:59,020 --> 00:13:02,980
And Kane finds his destiny.

94
00:13:02,980 --> 00:13:09,740
To redemption leads many ways.
Unfortunately, not all of them peaceful.

- Look! Some sort of magical signs!

Do not burn it as a witch?

In the fire!

Do not kill the man who robbed you?

Look for areas for the night.

- Yes, thank you, Meredith.

Why do I ...

153
00:19:09,220 --> 00:19:11,780
- Fought with the Spaniards?
- I had to.

154
00:19:11,780 --> 00:19:13,780
And with whom More?

155
00:19:15,980 --> 00:19:18,900
With all managed to war, it seems.

156
00:19:21,220 --> 00:19:23,300
There were many masters.

157
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:26,660
And sailed with Admiral Drake.

158
00:19:26,660 --> 00:19:28,300
Admiral Drake!

159
00:19:29,340 --> 00:19:31,420
But it ended badly.

How it must have fun!
See the world ...

161
00:19:36,860 --> 00:19:38,500
Learn something new ...

162
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:41,860
A life full of violence and bloodshed,
you think, is fascinating?

163
00:19:41,900 --> 00:19:46,020
You know what I had in mind. Edward, why
you ospraivaesh all, no matter what I said?

164
00:19:46,020 --> 00:19:47,740
- You already have to understand that ...
- Come on!

165
00:19:47,740 --> 00:19:51,380
I fought in the army of the queen. Once or twice.
Yet found faith.

166

00:20:01,060 --> 00:20:04,380
I must confess, Mr. Krotorn ...

168
00:20:05,980 --> 00:20:09,100
I was at home was worse than in combat.

169
00:20:09,820 --> 00:20:13,060
Kill for me a piece of cake.

170
00:20:26,380 --> 00:20:29,380
Dare to argue with - will not get anything.

171
00:20:29,380 --> 00:20:34,420
If you leave, it would not be able to return!
Do not even think to disobey!

172
00:20:47,140 --> 00:20:49,500
Help!

173
00:20:50,380 --> 00:20:52,820
Help! Stop!

174
00:20:53,780 --> 00:20:55,100
Marcus. What are you doing?

175
00:20:55,140 --> 00:20:58,380
Solomon! I thought you had already saved
from the life of priests of the flight.

176
00:20:58,380 --> 00:21:00,940
- Solomon ...
- Shut up! I am not allowed to open his mouth.

177
00:21:00,940 --> 00:21:02,700
Sarah, run!

178
00:21:03,060 --> 00:21:05,700
This is not your worry, brother!

179
00:21:07,940 --> 00:21:10,180
Since you go away and leave you a souvenir.

180
00:21:11,820 --> 00:21:16,460
And now look here! I am the eldest son!
I - heir!

181
00:21:16,460 --> 00:21:23,780
I will get everything, but you - nothing!
Take the load and away from this land!

182
00:21:25,900 --> 00:21:27,500
Marcus!

183
00:21:30,820 --> 00:21:32,500
It is a friend.

184
00:21:33,540 --> 00:21:36,700
- Please, join!
- Thank you.

185
00:21:40,580 --> 00:21:42,100
How are you?

186
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:47,300
Bruises bruises yes, nonsense. Your daughter --
Healer of God.

187
00:21:47,300 --> 00:21:50,820
So it. All of the mother.

188
00:21:54,620 --> 00:22:00,100
Though the whole Earth will pass, but rather women not syschete!
My family - all this for me.

189
00:22:00,100 --> 00:22:01,580
You are lucky.

190
00:22:04,060 --> 00:22:05,860
And you have those?

191
00:22:05,860 --> 00:22:12,700
A brother, but since ...
Lifetime passed.

192
00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:17,620
We all lost loved ones. Because of the plague,
harassment, prejudice.

193
00:22:18,380 --> 00:22:20,820
Take even Edward.

194
00:22:20,820 --> 00:22:25,300
He had a wife and child.
But the Lord took her to their own.

195
00:22:29,940 --> 00:22:33,980
And now you want to swim in the New World?

196
00:22:33,980 --> 00:22:35,660
Yes, we want. Exactly.

197
00:22:36,700 --> 00:22:40,900
Sometimes all the better to start life anew.

198
00:22:41,620 --> 00:22:44,180
You can go with us.

199
00:22:45,380 --> 00:22:49,300
You are very warm-hearted man, William.

200
00:22:50,340 --> 00:22:52,620
Thank you. Over the proposal.

201
00:22:52,620 --> 00:22:56,780
I'll be honest with you.
You should know who calls in the road.

202
00:22:58,620 --> 00:23:01,300
I've done wrong.

203
00:23:01,300 --> 00:23:03,220
Cruel.

204
00:23:04,380 --> 00:23:05,660
Evil.

205
00:23:05,660 --> 00:23:07,500
Terrible.

206
00:23:08,340 --> 00:23:14,540
I am very ...
No, I was ...

207
00:23:14,540 --> 00:23:16,860
Very sinful.

208
00:23:17,460 --> 00:23:19,700
Bad.

209
00:23:20,420 --> 00:23:23,260
But the Lord says about redemption!

210
00:23:23,260 --> 00:23:25,580
And forgiveness.

211
00:23:25,580 --> 00:23:28,260
No. My soul is damned.

212
00:23:28,260 --> 00:23:32,580
Servants of Satan will come after me, I go down the path of peace.

213
00:23:33,300 --> 00:23:35,140
Well, stay in it.

214
00:23:37,140 --> 00:23:38,980
Do not go ...

215
00:23:40,660 --> 00:23:43,140
Since paths of peace.

216
00:24:12,340 --> 00:24:13,540
Captain Kane!

217
00:24:13,580 --> 00:24:14,340
Yes, Miss?

218
00:24:15,340 --> 00:24:20,180
I'll sew clothes.
Your already a bit ...

219
00:24:22,060 --> 00:24:23,740
Lightly, Miss?

220
00:24:23,740 --> 00:24:27,660
Slightly worn ....

221
00:24:31,780 --> 00:24:33,460
You are so kind.

222
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:37,900
Thank you.

223
00:24:47,100 --> 00:24:50,220
It is more suitable stately man.
True, William?

224
00:24:50,220 --> 00:24:52,940
Certainly, it is better,
than in previous rags!

225
00:24:52,940 --> 00:24:55,660
Was glad to win your approval.

226
00:24:55,660 --> 00:24:57,660
Right now you have a respectable appearance.

227
00:24:57,660 --> 00:25:00,420
Well, quite a while no one could say both me.

228
00:25:02,820 --> 00:25:04,220
Thank you!

229
00:25:15,540 --> 00:25:17,500
You sail with us in America?

230
00:25:17,500 --> 00:25:20,260
- Not sure, Samuel.
- How so?

231
00:25:20,260 --> 00:25:21,620
Well ...

232
00:25:22,660 --> 00:25:25,540
You are with his family rushes into a new life.

233
00:25:25,540 --> 00:25:28,380
And I have to correct the former.

234
00:25:28,380 --> 00:25:30,300
- Tell the truth?
- Yep.

235
00:25:30,300 --> 00:25:33,060
You're able to kill those who attacked you!

236
00:25:33,060 --> 00:25:35,260
In the old days ...

237
00:25:35,260 --> 00:25:39,340
I would have ripped the heart still living out of their chest.

238
00:25:44,100 --> 00:25:45,940
With me poderetes?

239
00:25:45,940 --> 00:25:48,740
Poder, if not throw
their silly questions!

240
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:52,640
- Hell! "
- I have no reason to fight with you, young man!

241
00:25:53,100 --> 00:25:55,140
-Samuel!
-And here's the reason!

242
00:25:55,140 --> 00:25:58,020
To save from thieves beautiful maiden!

243
00:25:58,020 --> 00:26:00,780
Oh, Solomon, save us, for God's sake!

244
00:26:00,780 --> 00:26:02,380
To arms!

245
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:11,820
Samuel!
Come into the carriage, quick!

246
00:26:51,500 --> 00:26:53,380
Who could have done it?

247
00:26:53,380 --> 00:26:54,860
Devil!

248
00:26:54,860 --> 00:26:57,180
The devil himself was here!

249
00:27:08,780 --> 00:27:13,260
There were no devil.
Here, burning witch, apparently.

250
00:27:14,580 --> 00:27:17,020
It must be a creature escaped.

251
00:27:22,220 --> 00:27:23,980
We better go.

252
00:27:23,980 --> 00:27:25,400
We can not leave these
people vultures.

253
00:27:50,700 --> 00:27:51,980
Do not feel sorry for firewood, Edward!

254
00:27:52,700 --> 00:27:55,460
That night, the darkness is better
close at bay.

255
00:27:57,140 --> 00:27:59,980
My child, that happened to you?

256
00:27:59,980 --> 00:28:02,940
Leave bednyashku alone, William!

257
00:28:02,940 --> 00:28:05,100
They wanted to burn the witch.

258
00:28:09,140 --> 00:28:12,340
People came to see her cramps.

259
00:28:12,340 --> 00:28:15,100
But the flames did not touch it ...

260
00:28:16,180 --> 00:28:20,180
She laughed, and more ...

261
00:28:20,180 --> 00:28:25,140
She said that all the offspring of the devil
free to roam the earth.

262
00:28:29,380 --> 00:28:31,100
And then ...

263
00:28:32,180 --> 00:28:32,900
It has all been murdered.

264
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:39,220
Burned their eyes.
Because they came to see.

265
00:28:44,260 --> 00:28:45,780
Let us pray.

266
00:28:45,780 --> 00:28:46,420
- I'm tired!
- Even a minute.

267
00:28:49,100 --> 00:28:51,020
Child, pray to be.

268
00:28:51,020 --> 00:28:54,260
- I do not want you to pray.
- Hush, hush ...

269
00:28:55,020 --> 00:28:56,740
I'm tired!

270
00:28:57,060 --> 00:28:58,660
Spare?

271
00:28:58,660 --> 00:29:01,460
Well, of course tired, poor thing.

272
00:29:02,460 --> 00:29:04,420
Let us arrange accommodation for you.

273
00:29:04,900 --> 00:29:06,260
EdwardI

274
00:29:06,260 --> 00:29:08,660
It would be a girl to wear your cross today.

275
00:29:09,380 --> 00:29:12,380
- He will protect her.
- Of course.

276
00:29:13,940 --> 00:29:16,860
- Hold.
- Good.

277
00:29:17,700 --> 00:29:19,540
Here, baby.

278
00:29:23,620 --> 00:29:27,700
Is better to put on it.
He will protect you.

279
00:29:28,060 --> 00:29:29,620
Solomon!

280
00:29:32,580 --> 00:29:35,220
What we need is you!

281
00:29:40,140 --> 00:29:41,780
- What are you?
- Meredith ...

282
00:29:42,180 --> 00:29:43,260
Take it, child.

283
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:46,460
She - a witch!

284
00:29:48,820 --> 00:29:51,660
The devil is waiting for you long ago, Kane!

285
00:30:11,860 --> 00:30:14,140
Decided to hide? Run.

286
00:30:16,900 --> 00:30:17,700
Back! Do not run away!

287
00:30:24,020 --> 00:30:26,140
Move!

288
00:30:37,340 --> 00:30:38,700
Put your hands!

289
00:30:40,060 --> 00:30:42,980
New recruits for Malachi, my lord.

290
00:30:51,700 --> 00:30:54,260
You are ready to serve his master?

291
00:30:54,260 --> 00:30:56,900
I am happy with this option!

292
00:30:56,900 --> 00:31:01,500
To serve us, you will have to be us.

293
00:31:03,500 --> 00:31:05,460
Well! Tell me what to do?

294
00:31:18,740 --> 00:31:20,220
What is he doing?

295
00:31:41,700 --> 00:31:43,980
Good-oh!

296
00:31:57,300 --> 00:31:59,900
- Father, I collected firewood!
- Good for you, Samuel!

297
00:32:00,620 --> 00:32:02,420
Now mangled.

298
00:32:02,420 --> 00:32:04,900
Let me help you.
Must pull.

299
00:32:04,900 --> 00:32:06,180
Thank you.

300
00:32:06,180 --> 00:32:09,660
Give me ... look.

301
00:32:10,580 --> 00:32:13,300
- Does it hurt?
- No. I do not feel anything.

302
00:32:13,900 --> 00:32:18,100
Why I pick up on this creature?

303
00:32:19,940 --> 00:32:21,700
I do not know.

304
00:32:23,340 --> 00:32:25,500
In their evil reasons.

305
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:27,220
So, we are in danger?

306
00:32:27,980 --> 00:32:30,340
Do not worry.

307
00:32:30,340 --> 00:32:33,060
As you are not possessed by evil, Meredith.

308
00:32:34,620 --> 00:32:36,060
Believe me.

309
00:32:36,580 --> 00:32:38,180
I believe.

310
00:32:39,020 --> 00:32:43,620
What are you fidgeting, Samuel? Take branch
more. I love hot supets!

311
00:32:44,380 --> 00:32:45,820
William?

312
00:32:48,140 --> 00:32:51,060
Large fire is better not to breed.

313
00:32:51,820 --> 00:32:53,900
No need to attract attention.

314
00:33:27,780 --> 00:33:29,900
- Solomon!
- What is it?

315
00:33:29,900 --> 00:33:34,700
- I heard something. - Where?
- Over there. For those trees.

316
00:33:34,700 --> 00:33:36,180
Wait here.

317
00:33:36,780 --> 00:33:38,660
Help!

318
00:33:41,700 --> 00:33:43,580
Help!!

319
00:33:48,340 --> 00:33:50,860
Samuel?
Samuel, DROP!

320
00:33:51,860 --> 00:33:52,900
Hush, sir!

321
00:33:54,020 --> 00:33:56,860
Below the head. And shut up!

322
00:33:56,860 --> 00:34:00,340
Who is Solomon? Who are they?

323
00:34:00,340 --> 00:34:04,540
Listen carefully. Go back to your father!
Quickly go all out!

324
00:34:05,260 --> 00:34:06,300
Run!

325
00:34:29,180 --> 00:34:30,380
Do not touch her!

326
00:34:32,220 --> 00:34:33,580
Meredith!

327
00:34:36,780 --> 00:34:38,180
Let go!

328
00:34:38,580 --> 00:34:39,940
Mom!

329
00:34:47,140 --> 00:34:48,300
Solomon!

330
00:34:52,500 --> 00:34:53,980
Samuel!

331
00:35:13,140 --> 00:35:14,220
Solomon!

332
00:35:15,060 --> 00:35:15,980
This is it!

333
00:35:18,220 --> 00:35:20,980
No! Stop!
Stop!

334
00:35:20,980 --> 00:35:23,140
Solomon!
Save us!

335
00:35:32,780 --> 00:35:33,580
Stop!

336
00:35:34,060 --> 00:35:35,540
Please, leave him.

337
00:35:37,140 --> 00:35:38,300
Let me go!

338
00:35:38,980 --> 00:35:40,220
Do not touch it.

339
00:35:40,740 --> 00:35:42,380
You see, I'm unarmed.

340
00:35:44,220 --> 00:35:46,140
Solomon, save him!

341
00:35:47,380 --> 00:35:49,500
- Kill all!
- Quiet, Samuel!

342
00:35:49,540 --> 00:35:51,580
Solomon, kill all!

343
00:35:51,580 --> 00:35:53,220
Listen, Samuel, quiet!

344
00:35:53,220 --> 00:35:56,940
Not to take, okay?
You will not break - and he let go.

345
00:35:57,660 --> 00:35:58,980
Release?

346
00:36:00,140 --> 00:36:02,420
You also can, I know!

347
00:36:02,580 --> 00:36:04,460
I said shut up, Samuel!

348
00:36:06,180 --> 00:36:07,580
Listen ...

349
00:36:09,340 --> 00:36:12,660
Are you the owner? What do you want?
I'll do anything.

350
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:30,460
Kill me!

351
00:36:31,860 --> 00:36:33,900
You can.

352
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:37,500
No, I ...
No way.

353
00:36:38,900 --> 00:36:43,140
I. .. peace-loving people.

354
00:36:45,660 --> 00:36:48,140
Do not even think to hurt the boy.

355
00:36:48,140 --> 00:36:50,540
This child ...

356
00:36:51,140 --> 00:36:52,260
Puppy ...

357
00:36:52,980 --> 00:36:56,100
- Go ahead all of you.
- Save us.

358
00:36:56,100 --> 00:36:58,580
He - the only man here.

359
00:36:59,260 --> 00:37:00,820
No need!

360
00:37:00,820 --> 00:37:02,780
- Solomon!
- Stop it!
- Listen to me ...

361
00:37:03,300 --> 00:37:05,740
No-e-e-t!

362
00:37:08,940 --> 00:37:09,380
No!

363
00:37:09,380 --> 00:37:11,328
No-e-e-t!

364
00:37:11,328 --> 00:37:12,899
Samuel!

365
00:37:17,740 --> 00:37:20,140
Bring labeled!

366
00:37:25,860 --> 00:37:28,420
Kill them! Kill them all, Solomon!

367
00:37:28,420 --> 00:37:31,320
Save us! I implore you, save us!

368
00:37:32,940 --> 00:37:35,220
What do you want from me? ..

369
00:37:37,620 --> 00:37:39,580
What?

370
00:37:43,740 --> 00:37:48,100
And all this, why I'll need?

371
00:37:51,660 --> 00:37:54,020
So be it!

372
00:37:57,020 --> 00:37:58,860
Murder ...

373
00:38:00,300 --> 00:38:03,100
I paved a road to Hell.

374
00:38:05,340 --> 00:38:09,740
But such a price I gladly pay!

375
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:23,940
Help! Save me!

376
00:38:24,380 --> 00:38:25,940
- Save it!

377
00:38:48,080 --> 00:38:49,400
Let her go!

378
00:39:33,620 --> 00:39:35,140
Stop!

379
00:39:55,860 --> 00:39:57,420
There, there!

380
00:40:27,940 --> 00:40:29,300
Solomon ...

381
00:40:31,460 --> 00:40:33,114
- Bring Meredith.
- Yes.

382
00:40:33,114 --> 00:40:35,795
- Bring it!
- Right!

383
00:40:37,020 --> 00:40:40,140
- Curse return it!
- I will return.

384
00:40:40,140 --> 00:40:43,860
For me ...
This is my ...

385
00:40:46,220 --> 00:40:48,980
... My last words.

386
00:40:48,980 --> 00:40:51,620
I know God hears.

387
00:40:52,420 --> 00:40:54,900
You will save our girl ...

388
00:40:55,820 --> 00:41:01,700
... That, and his soul will save.
Canst all atone.

389
00:41:01,700 --> 00:41:05,660
Solomon, I know that it will.

390
00:41:06,580 --> 00:41:08,420
Swear to me.

391
00:41:08,420 --> 00:41:11,340
- Pledge This!
- I swear.

392
00:41:11,340 --> 00:41:14,220
By William, I find her!

393
00:41:47,820 --> 00:41:48,420
Find it.

394
00:41:49,540 --> 00:41:50,900
Go!

395
00:43:19,180 --> 00:43:21,260
Go, go!

396
00:43:28,820 --> 00:43:29,460
Hold him!

397
00:44:21,220 --> 00:44:23,980
Meredit! You are here ...

398
00:44:24,820 --> 00:44:26,700
Have you seen ... Have you seen this girl?

399
00:44:26,700 --> 00:44:29,340
Wait! Check, please ...
Have you seen her?

400
00:44:29,340 --> 00:44:30,940
I do not know her, let go ...

401
00:44:31,340 --> 00:44:34,700
Come to me! Where you drove?
Have you seen this girl?

402
00:44:34,700 --> 00:44:37,620
I do not know ... There everywhere robbers!

403
00:44:37,620 --> 00:44:39,420
Look!
Have you seen this girl?

404
00:44:39,420 --> 00:44:42,900
I beg you, let go! I want
to his home!

405
00:44:45,660 --> 00:44:48,900
Sorry, baby. Forgive me ...

406
00:44:49,660 --> 00:44:52,180
All. Everything. Go.

407
00:45:19,220 --> 00:45:21,420
Where? Back!
Where you have luck? What do you want?

408
00:45:22,580 --> 00:45:24,700
Better to live, baby.

409
00:45:24,700 --> 00:45:28,980
We are not saved. Slavery or death - that
all our choices.

410
00:45:29,900 --> 00:45:33,114
- Lord - and he did not save us!
- We'll get out!

411
00:45:33,114 --> 00:45:35,796
Hold my hand. We will survive
this, you'll see.

412
00:45:36,820 --> 00:45:38,300
Silence!

413
00:45:39,380 --> 00:45:41,100
Give it here!

414
00:46:17,340 --> 00:46:19,180
O Creator ...

415
00:47:09,860 --> 00:47:12,620
[bells]

416
00:48:08,260 --> 00:48:12,460
Lord, hear my prayer.

417
00:48:14,300 --> 00:48:18,060
I let you down - I can not find it ...

418
00:48:18,060 --> 00:48:19,620
I'm lost.

419
00:48:21,500 --> 00:48:23,700
Ozar me!

420
00:48:23,700 --> 00:48:26,220
Let me find my own way!

421
00:48:29,580 --> 00:48:31,460
Holy Father!

422
00:48:31,460 --> 00:48:34,020
At such times we are living.

423
00:48:34,660 --> 00:48:37,580
I was looking for a sanctuary to pray.

424
00:48:40,580 --> 00:48:43,500
Blessed be the Lord in his temple!

425
00:48:44,860 --> 00:48:48,220
Blessed be in the stronghold of His power!

426
00:48:53,740 --> 00:48:58,900
I have seen such terrible things ...

427
00:49:00,820 --> 00:49:04,060
- So this is your house?
- Other I do not need.

428
00:49:04,060 --> 00:49:05,180
Yes and no.

429
00:49:06,340 --> 00:49:08,860
I have no other.

430
00:49:11,220 --> 00:49:12,940
You from afar?

431
00:49:12,940 --> 00:49:16,780
Three days of continuous racing - and here I am.

432
00:49:17,780 --> 00:49:20,420
But where "here" - do not know.

433
00:49:22,180 --> 00:49:25,580
This border ownership of Somerset and Devanshira.

434
00:49:25,580 --> 00:49:27,420
And yet my house.

435
00:49:27,420 --> 00:49:29,460
A sad return!

436
00:49:30,740 --> 00:49:33,140
So the looters and then visited?

437
00:49:33,140 --> 00:49:35,620
Narrow-eyed dogs Malachi.

438
00:49:36,147 --> 00:49:38,899
Yes, they are then passed.

439
00:49:41,020 --> 00:49:44,980
Now the robbers own all
lands to the west of here.

440
00:49:46,660 --> 00:49:49,140
It turns out I have to the west.

441
00:49:49,140 --> 00:49:51,900
Meet his doom, my son.

442
00:49:52,940 --> 00:49:57,060
- Who is this hat?
- A faithful servant of the devil.

443
00:49:57,060 --> 00:49:59,900
Wizard. Nobody saw.

444
00:49:59,900 --> 00:50:04,940
Hiding in his castle and sends
Warriors in the mask to do his will.

445
00:50:04,940 --> 00:50:09,820
His army is weak transforms into slaves,
and strong - at the soldiers.

446
00:50:10,820 --> 00:50:14,740
But the Lord will save the righteous!

447
00:50:21,540 --> 00:50:25,540
Here ... Here is what he said. I have read.

448
00:50:29,820 --> 00:50:33,740
Here, found. I have read.

449
00:50:35,260 --> 00:50:37,580
This End of the World.

450
00:50:38,500 --> 00:50:40,460
Do you really believe it?

451
00:50:40,460 --> 00:50:47,740
Abomination, which restrained the light of Christ,
crawls out of the flames, in order to harm and suffering!

452
00:50:49,780 --> 00:50:52,820
It seems that Christ and all his angels slept.

453
00:50:53,740 --> 00:50:55,700
... While we are in distress.

454
00:50:55,700 --> 00:50:57,300
Not blaspheming!

455
00:50:59,460 --> 00:51:02,500
All tvoritisya - by the will of God.

456
00:51:02,500 --> 00:51:04,660
Is this true?

457
00:51:04,660 --> 00:51:11,860
What evil can get away with walking on land!
And it remains protected only ... what?

458
00:51:12,940 --> 00:51:15,060
Only faith?

459
00:51:16,020 --> 00:51:18,620
So says the Holy Scripture.

460
00:51:18,620 --> 00:51:19,700
Quiet!

461
00:51:24,580 --> 00:51:25,980
What is it?

462
00:51:30,180 --> 00:51:32,260
This is something outside.

463
00:51:33,380 --> 00:51:35,660
You're wrong.

464
00:51:35,660 --> 00:51:38,500
Outside, no harm there.

465
00:51:41,820 --> 00:51:44,380
The evil is already here.

466
00:51:45,180 --> 00:51:46,420
So?

467
00:51:49,620 --> 00:51:51,260
Come.

468
00:52:03,980 --> 00:52:05,580
See?

469
00:52:11,220 --> 00:52:14,700
Satan wanted to get them all.

470
00:52:14,700 --> 00:52:17,900
In order to sift as wheat.

471
00:52:38,860 --> 00:52:40,940
O Creator ...

472
00:52:43,020 --> 00:52:45,020
And what could I do?

473
00:52:46,180 --> 00:52:48,420
Delete creatures!

474
00:52:48,420 --> 00:52:51,860
They were once men and zhnnschinami ...

475
00:52:51,860 --> 00:52:56,100
I knew ih.Oni not to blame for that
spell Malachi to change them.

476
00:52:56,100 --> 00:53:01,940
This is my flock.
I give them shelter.

477
00:53:03,300 --> 00:53:05,020
their care.

478
00:53:07,740 --> 00:53:10,420
- And the food.
- Food?

479
00:53:12,500 --> 00:53:13,860
What?

480
00:53:13,860 --> 00:53:15,700
What do you feed them?

481
00:53:16,500 --> 00:53:17,980
that's what!

482
00:53:20,140 --> 00:53:24,460
I leave you satanic creatures
for the mortification yours!

483
00:53:24,460 --> 00:53:27,380
And save your soul.

484
00:53:27,380 --> 00:53:29,620
Have mercy on your soul!

485
00:55:19,740 --> 00:55:21,380
Your pal.

486
00:55:32,700 --> 00:55:36,180
And I remember it, old man!
He warrior.

487
00:55:36,180 --> 00:55:38,020
Remember?

488
00:55:38,660 --> 00:55:40,740
What are you doing here, pilgrim?

489
00:55:40,740 --> 00:55:44,940
Here's what ... It turns out you are also given
themselves to this evil.

490
00:55:45,900 --> 00:55:47,700
And you should!

491
00:55:47,700 --> 00:55:51,140
Hat is about to seize all around.

492
00:55:52,020 --> 00:55:53,900
You have no purpose to fight.

493
00:55:53,900 --> 00:55:56,260
You only remains that fight.

494
00:55:56,260 --> 00:55:58,660
But it's not on your part ...

495
00:55:59,420 --> 00:56:00,860
Exactly?

496
00:56:00,860 --> 00:56:02,700
Who knows?

497
00:56:04,380 --> 00:56:07,620
And if I have changed my mind?

498
00:56:45,060 --> 00:56:47,260
No! What do you do?

499
00:56:49,460 --> 00:56:50,580
Stop!

500
00:56:50,580 --> 00:56:53,660
Look - this girl was taken yours.

501
00:56:54,940 --> 00:56:57,060
- You saw her?
- No-one I have not seen!

502
00:56:58,140 --> 00:57:05,700
Look carefully, brat! This is the last
chance to save your worthless life!

503
00:57:05,700 --> 00:57:07,020
Speak!

504
00:57:07,020 --> 00:57:10,580
- Okay, I saw it!
Have you seen her? Tell me, where is she?

505
00:57:10,580 --> 00:57:12,180
Died.

506
00:57:15,540 --> 00:57:17,460
Died?

507
00:57:17,460 --> 00:57:20,460
You're lying, scumbag!

508
00:57:20,460 --> 00:57:25,020
What is it? Can I lie?
I did want to live!

509
00:57:25,020 --> 00:57:28,820
You're lying to me!

510
00:57:28,820 --> 00:57:30,980
Not lie. No.
Not her!

511
00:57:30,980 --> 00:57:33,580
I do not believe it!

512
00:58:43,700 --> 00:58:46,500
For a pitcher. Keep the change.

513
00:58:47,100 --> 00:58:48,940
Thank you, sir.

514
00:59:04,740 --> 00:59:06,340
You sure of?

515
00:59:07,460 --> 00:59:08,860
It's him!

516
00:59:08,860 --> 00:59:10,900
I recognized him.

517
00:59:17,180 --> 00:59:18,540
Sir?

518
00:59:19,580 --> 00:59:21,140
Captain Kane!

519
00:59:21,660 --> 00:59:25,780
I Henry Telford. Remember me?

520
00:59:26,980 --> 00:59:28,660
Captain Kane!

521
00:59:30,820 --> 00:59:35,620
I am with you sailed on the "Tersule" assistant.
My name Telford. Remember?

522
00:59:35,620 --> 00:59:38,740
- It's not him.
- This is it. Kane.

523
00:59:39,700 --> 00:59:41,740
The present leader, too, believe!

524
00:59:41,740 --> 00:59:44,900
And where it leads us to another tavern?
Look at him!

525
00:59:46,340 --> 00:59:51,180
My friend assures me that in life,
not seen a better warrior.

526
00:59:52,540 --> 00:59:54,980
- I do not believe him.
- And correctly.

527
00:59:56,580 --> 00:59:59,540
I know what you can! I saw!

528
01:00:00,860 --> 01:00:03,940
All gone long ago.

529
01:00:05,780 --> 01:00:07,900
It is not.

530
01:00:09,700 --> 01:00:14,820
And I, Telford, has lost its soul.

531
01:00:23,660 --> 01:00:26,460
- The sense of it not. Forget it.
- Stop!

532
01:00:28,220 --> 01:00:31,780
Captain, we need a leader.
We must resist!

533
01:00:31,780 --> 01:00:34,100
So resist!

534
01:00:38,260 --> 01:00:40,420
It is no more ...

535
01:00:42,860 --> 01:00:44,980
I lost it.

536
01:00:44,980 --> 01:00:47,740
And now will pay for it.

537
01:00:49,020 --> 01:00:53,220
And let for my coming.
I was not touching.

538
01:01:44,340 --> 01:01:48,380
Mercy! I beseech you!
Ah-ah-ah-ah!!

539
01:01:54,900 --> 01:01:59,260
Here's what awaits all who dare
resist hat!

540
01:02:00,500 --> 01:02:02,900
Beseech you! Mercy!

541
01:02:02,900 --> 01:02:05,900
There will be no mercy!

542
01:03:17,940 --> 01:03:20,660
That death no one will save!

543
01:03:20,660 --> 01:03:22,980
This is a nonentity!

544
01:03:22,980 --> 01:03:29,020
Beat him to the cross!
And burned to ashes since the city!

545
01:04:04,860 --> 01:04:06,620
Help!

546
01:05:39,140 --> 01:05:40,980
No ... No!

547
01:05:42,380 --> 01:05:44,980
Solomon!

548
01:05:47,100 --> 01:05:48,940
Solomon!

549
01:05:55,780 --> 01:06:00,380
Solomon! Do not die!
Solomon!

550
01:06:00,380 --> 01:06:01,500
Meredith ...

551
01:06:01,500 --> 01:06:02,380
You hear me?

552
01:06:02,380 --> 01:06:03,660
Meredith!

553
01:06:03,660 --> 01:06:06,740
- Solomon!
- Meredith!

554
01:06:09,780 --> 01:06:11,300
God!

555
01:06:11,300 --> 01:06:13,660
Give me strength!

556
01:06:40,780 --> 01:06:42,700
Solomon-o-o-n!

557
01:07:07,260 --> 01:07:09,300
Captain Kane!

558
01:07:18,460 --> 01:07:23,020
- Another 20 in the Rhone Marche.
- They are becoming stronger.

559
01:07:26,340 --> 01:07:28,540
That's why we want Kane!

560
01:07:28,540 --> 01:07:31,300
- What can we do to him ...
- He needs us!

561
01:07:31,300 --> 01:07:33,100
Whatever the past may have been his sins ...

562
01:07:33,100 --> 01:07:36,660
One of the devil to change to another?
I think this is stupid.

563
01:07:38,260 --> 01:07:43,180
Earth, stones, fire and water ...

564
01:07:43,180 --> 01:07:46,500
Do not poke your nose to me with his vile
blasphemous magic!

565
01:07:46,500 --> 01:07:49,460
This is my "lousy" magic made you!

566
01:07:49,460 --> 01:07:53,060
In her more power than your hristianstkom God!

567
01:07:53,060 --> 01:07:55,900
I advise you to remember it!

568
01:08:05,620 --> 01:08:08,420
I sang what you asked.

569
01:08:08,420 --> 01:08:10,940
His body healed.

570
01:08:13,060 --> 01:08:15,100
What do you see in the future?

571
01:08:15,100 --> 01:08:18,860
Your leader will lead you to the blood and darkness!

572
01:08:18,860 --> 01:08:22,580
And ready are you to this?
Goodbye.

573
01:09:47,940 --> 01:09:51,340
What are you doing?

574
01:09:51,340 --> 01:09:53,020
You need to lie!

575
01:09:53,020 --> 01:09:54,980
- I'm leaving.
- Where? Not all of course.

576
01:09:54,980 --> 01:09:56,420
She's alive!

577
01:09:57,660 --> 01:10:00,900
But the wounds barely healed. And we still
the big battle is not ready.

578
01:10:01,340 --> 01:10:02,940
Have to wait.

579
01:10:02,940 --> 01:10:06,460
I invite you to go!
I do not want this!

580
01:10:08,140 --> 01:10:11,260
You can not ask for. But we're going.

581
01:10:11,260 --> 01:10:14,380
He promised us that you destroy evil.

582
01:10:14,380 --> 01:10:16,820
And we will be next to you.

583
01:10:22,180 --> 01:10:24,460
Just too "promised?

584
01:10:25,940 --> 01:10:28,780
You did it want to destroy?

585
01:10:31,860 --> 01:10:34,100
So we take!

586
01:10:34,900 --> 01:10:37,580
Hat was a priest and healer.

587
01:10:37,580 --> 01:10:41,540
But sold his soul to the devil for the power
which now possesses.

588
01:10:42,780 --> 01:10:44,420
It enslaves our people and destroy the earth.

589
01:10:46,220 --> 01:10:47,340
And the rider ...

590
01:10:50,060 --> 01:10:52,860
As the iron fist is his
shelf and carries the death!

591
01:10:52,860 --> 01:10:55,860
He guise of no face!

592
01:10:56,180 --> 01:10:58,660
He takes the soul of a tap.

593
01:10:59,180 --> 01:11:01,220
True. I have seen.

594
01:11:02,500 --> 01:11:06,540
If you kill him, hat will be vulnerable.

595
01:11:06,540 --> 01:11:09,020
Saying is easier than to do.

596
01:11:09,020 --> 01:11:12,020
No. He will fall.

597
01:11:12,500 --> 01:11:14,460
You know where that hat?

598
01:11:14,580 --> 01:11:16,780
This is not a mystery.
In the castle Aksmut.

599
01:11:16,780 --> 01:11:19,220
No!

600
01:11:19,220 --> 01:11:21,300
Can not be ...

601
01:11:21,420 --> 01:11:24,980
No doubt. You know him?

602
01:11:25,020 --> 01:11:28,020
My father was his owner.

603
01:11:28,020 --> 01:11:30,300
I grew up there.

604
01:11:30,300 --> 01:11:32,620
Now there are no master.

605
01:11:35,660 --> 01:11:38,100
And I did not know that he died ...

606
01:11:38,100 --> 01:11:39,740
Well ...

607
01:11:39,740 --> 01:11:42,140
It's time this finish!

608
01:11:42,580 --> 01:11:45,580
People, all who are here, take the gun!

609
01:11:45,580 --> 01:11:48,420
- We do not Goto ...
- Suppose now that he is protected!

610
01:11:48,420 --> 01:11:52,220
- We are not yet ready.
- And he, too!

611
01:11:52,220 --> 01:11:54,620
- We are very little.
- What's the reason? Remember, I took the city a smaller number?

612
01:11:54,620 --> 01:11:56,700
But as we get into the castle?

613
01:11:58,580 --> 01:12:03,980
Forgot that I was born there and does not intend
enter through the main gate?

614
01:13:33,780 --> 01:13:36,620
Good God, and it is - my house?

615
01:13:36,620 --> 01:13:38,260
You really live here?

616
01:13:38,260 --> 01:13:40,980
- Yeah.
- This explains a lot.

617
01:14:01,580 --> 01:14:06,340
- And you're here!
- With the return of ... Solomon Kane!

618
01:14:16,580 --> 01:14:17,900
To arms!

619
01:15:04,420 --> 01:15:06,980
Yalbash, diversion of people! We did not win!

620
01:15:09,740 --> 01:15:11,220
Follow me!

621
01:15:13,020 --> 01:15:14,420
Go!

622
01:16:22,780 --> 01:16:24,180
Meredith!

623
01:16:26,780 --> 01:16:29,180
Save us!

624
01:16:29,180 --> 01:16:31,180
Meredith! There is a girl named Meredith?

625
01:16:31,500 --> 01:16:32,460
Meredith!

626
01:16:49,420 --> 01:16:51,380
- You are free!
- Thank you!

627
01:16:51,380 --> 01:16:52,900
Run faster!

628
01:17:18,020 --> 01:17:20,500
Come out, old man, you're free.

629
01:17:22,620 --> 01:17:24,860
I'll help you.

630
01:17:26,980 --> 01:17:30,220
Now try to weaken the chain.

631
01:17:30,220 --> 01:17:33,380
Even if you do it, I'll stay.

632
01:17:33,380 --> 01:17:38,500
- What are you mumbling? Why?
- Because it was my house.

633
01:17:44,300 --> 01:17:46,140
Father?

634
01:17:48,780 --> 01:17:50,740
Solomon?

635
01:17:54,020 --> 01:17:56,020
God ...

636
01:18:00,220 --> 01:18:04,540
And I thought I'd lost you forever.

637
01:18:04,540 --> 01:18:05,700
No.

638
01:18:05,700 --> 01:18:08,300
You were still a boy when ...

639
01:18:09,020 --> 01:18:10,740
No!

640
01:18:12,180 --> 01:18:15,060
You with them can not cope.

641
01:18:15,060 --> 01:18:19,500
These black magic is not less than iron.

642
01:18:24,780 --> 01:18:28,460
- How to release you?
- Nothing, Solomon. Not.

643
01:18:32,740 --> 01:18:34,940
Father ...

644
01:18:34,940 --> 01:18:37,860
I felt so ...

645
01:18:37,860 --> 01:18:42,700
The blame for what he did.
But I do not blame that Marcus has fallen ...

646
01:18:42,700 --> 01:18:48,660
- I am not his fault that he died.
- And he had not died, Solomon.

647
01:18:50,140 --> 01:18:54,660
If so - would not have happened all this horror.

648
01:18:54,660 --> 01:18:57,980
That is ...
Glory to the Creator, he is alive!

649
01:18:57,980 --> 01:19:02,380
He was saved by not God's will.

650
01:19:02,380 --> 01:19:05,340
What? I do not understand.

651
01:19:06,740 --> 01:19:13,060
Falling off a cliff, he was horribly maimed.
But breathing, the truth never came.

652
01:19:13,060 --> 01:19:17,300
Neither doctors nor the priests did not return him to life.

653
01:19:19,460 --> 01:19:23,100
And I brought a sorcerer.

654
01:19:23,500 --> 01:19:24,980
What!

655
01:19:24,980 --> 01:19:27,660
- Yes ...
- You gave Malachi here?

656
01:19:27,660 --> 01:19:34,620
I promised him everything that I have.
If only he returned to me Marcus.

657
01:19:37,740 --> 01:19:40,780
And it turned out, Solomon!

658
01:19:40,780 --> 01:19:46,460
His magic mirror he entered
into darkness and back Marcus back, but ...

659
01:19:48,580 --> 01:19:50,900
... he has changed.

660
01:19:51,580 --> 01:19:59,420
but his face, disfigured by his fall,
was hiding under the mask.

661
01:19:59,940 --> 01:20:03,420
And obey only the will of the sorcerer.

662
01:20:04,100 --> 01:20:06,380
It can not be my brother!

663
01:20:06,380 --> 01:20:10,700
This creature is your brother.
Or rather what was left of him.

664
01:20:10,700 --> 01:20:15,140
Now Marcus is ruining all who follow him.

665
01:20:18,220 --> 01:20:21,140
Execute my request.

666
01:20:21,140 --> 01:20:23,860
Just tell me, I'll do anything.

667
01:20:34,380 --> 01:20:38,020
We both have to answer.

668
01:20:38,020 --> 01:20:41,140
For my sins I'm ready to answer.

669
01:20:41,140 --> 01:20:43,420
Now.

670
01:20:43,740 --> 01:20:46,500
- No!
- You should!

671
01:20:46,500 --> 01:20:49,580
That I brought here a sorcerer.

672
01:20:49,580 --> 01:20:54,100
And while I breathe, he will be here.

673
01:20:55,940 --> 01:20:59,020
I will not let me die.

674
01:21:22,200 --> 01:21:25,280
Hurry! Here!

675
01:21:31,760 --> 01:21:33,560
- About the sake of God, help!
- Is that all?

676
01:21:33,560 --> 01:21:37,600
- All those who survived? - Two more here
about the rest do not know.

677
01:21:37,600 --> 01:21:41,160
Hold them here. You need only hold on.

678
01:21:41,560 --> 01:21:43,520
It's your stupidity?

679
01:21:44,360 --> 01:21:45,800
Hold out just a little!

680
01:21:46,960 --> 01:21:49,360
I can stop it with one blow!

681
01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:10,880
Malakal!

682
01:22:12,080 --> 01:22:14,800
Malakal!

683
01:22:15,160 --> 01:22:19,040
I come to you!
Did not you wanted?

684
01:22:43,600 --> 01:22:45,480
To me!

685
01:23:20,280 --> 01:23:21,680
Solomon!

686
01:23:21,680 --> 01:23:23,800
Solomon, go away, it's a trap!

687
01:23:29,040 --> 01:23:34,080
Long path, which will be a pilgrim
in the name of their faith.

688
01:23:35,600 --> 01:23:41,120
But even longer his way home
in the land of their fathers.

689
01:23:49,760 --> 01:23:52,600
I've long been waiting for you.

690
01:23:52,600 --> 01:23:56,000
Warlock unworthy of the throne of my father!

691
01:23:56,000 --> 01:24:00,960
Your father - just a child. Fool,
concluded a deal with the devil.

692
01:24:01,000 --> 01:24:05,560
He betrayed you.
Your soul is damned.

693
01:24:05,560 --> 01:24:06,880
Rather!

694
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:11,920
You still obedient, faithful son?

695
01:24:26,480 --> 01:24:28,360
Malakal!

696
01:24:29,280 --> 01:24:30,880
Malakal!

697
01:24:30,880 --> 01:24:33,400
Malakal, you coward!

698
01:24:36,880 --> 01:24:38,720
Meredith, you're not hurt?

699
01:24:39,640 --> 01:24:42,080
- You came for me!
- I swore to William.

700
01:24:43,400 --> 01:24:46,640
Solomon is a trap! They marked
me, that you came.

701
01:24:47,560 --> 01:24:48,920
Stop!

702
01:24:49,720 --> 01:24:52,880
- The devil is waiting for you.
- The Devil and as soon I will.

703
01:25:07,440 --> 01:25:09,160
Oh, God! Solomon!

704
01:25:13,120 --> 01:25:16,040
Brother, listen to me ...

705
01:25:16,600 --> 01:25:20,120
Are you listening, Marcus?
You are not obliged to obey him!

706
01:25:20,600 --> 01:25:21,440
No!

707
01:25:23,560 --> 01:25:25,000
Listen to me!

708
01:25:29,080 --> 01:25:30,080
No!

709
01:25:34,680 --> 01:25:37,240
Meredith, run!

710
01:25:51,040 --> 01:25:53,200
Where's your master?

711
01:25:53,200 --> 01:25:57,440
Where has he gone?
Where are you, hat?

712
01:25:57,440 --> 01:25:59,200
Disappeared into the darkness?

713
01:25:59,200 --> 01:26:02,480
What am I to you hiding?
I need you here.

714
01:26:02,840 --> 01:26:05,520
Each your step closer you here.

715
01:26:05,520 --> 01:26:11,800
Your pain was in retaliation for your sins.
My lord asked your soul!

716
01:26:12,640 --> 01:26:16,040
See what the devil sent for you!

717
01:26:16,040 --> 01:26:19,960
This creature drag you back to Hell!

718
01:26:19,960 --> 01:26:23,000
Your soul is damned!

719
01:26:23,280 --> 01:26:24,920
Lord ...

720
01:26:29,120 --> 01:26:30,320
Marcus!

721
01:26:32,280 --> 01:26:36,360
Our father is gone.
Now all that - yours!

722
01:26:36,360 --> 01:26:39,280
Hat can not command you!

723
01:26:47,480 --> 01:26:48,600
Stop!

724
01:27:07,920 --> 01:27:09,960
Brother, stop! Brother!

725
01:27:26,120 --> 01:27:27,480
Solomon!

726
01:27:46,240 --> 01:27:49,120
Give rest in peace, brother.

727
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:53,840
Only your innocent blood will release him!

728
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:05,520
Now you're free!

729
01:28:27,180 --> 01:28:28,980
Take it!

730
01:28:34,980 --> 01:28:39,100
Lord, to thee only hope.

731
01:29:18,900 --> 01:29:21,540
Stop! Let her!

732
01:29:24,020 --> 01:29:26,540
Can you take my soul!

733
01:29:26,540 --> 01:29:29,980
So why all the risk, even his soul ...

734
01:29:31,660 --> 01:29:34,020
... To save her?

735
01:29:34,820 --> 01:29:37,740
I swore an oath.

736
01:29:39,060 --> 01:29:40,780
I will keep it.

737
01:30:41,220 --> 01:30:43,060
Solomon ...

738
01:30:55,700 --> 01:30:57,300
Praise God!

739
01:30:59,700 --> 01:31:01,900
Praise God!

740
01:31:04,220 --> 01:31:05,940
He disappeared.

741
01:31:07,300 --> 01:31:10,380
Your father has promised ...

742
01:31:10,380 --> 01:31:15,500
... What if I will save you, I will save, and his soul.

743
01:31:17,300 --> 01:31:19,140
And he did.

744
01:31:20,620 --> 01:31:22,860
Yes. So it.

745
01:31:23,300 --> 01:31:26,820
I am no more the devil.

746
01:31:34,820 --> 01:31:36,740
Guards fell.

747
01:32:06,220 --> 01:32:11,900
Father, I have kept his oath.
Meredith returned to his mother.

748
01:32:12,660 --> 01:32:13,980
The demon disappeared.

749
01:32:13,980 --> 01:32:18,860
Banished into the darkness with the sorcerer
which all of us cursed.

750
01:32:19,820 --> 01:32:22,860
But to destroy the evil is not so simple.

751
01:32:22,860 --> 01:32:26,700
And I know that I still have to fight.

752
01:32:26,700 --> 01:32:32,140
Now I'm completely different. All through what I went through ...

753
01:32:32,140 --> 01:32:38,940
... All that I saw and everything that made ...
... Pointed out to me my destiny.

754
01:32:38,940 --> 01:32:42,020
There was a time when the world was plunged into darkness.

755
01:32:42,020 --> 01:32:47,260
Seasons of witchcraft and black magic
when no one was going against evil.

756
01:32:47,980 --> 01:32:50,060
These times ...

757
01:32:50,820 --> 01:32:53,340
... gone forever!
