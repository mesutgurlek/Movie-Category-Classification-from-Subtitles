58
00:11:14,964 --> 00:11:17,353


59
00:11:20,564 --> 00:11:23,078
This our third town in two years

60
00:11:24,644 --> 00:11:27,681


61
00:11:28,884 --> 00:11:30,078


62
00:11:31,084 --> 00:11:32,312


63
00:11:33,524 --> 00:11:35,003


64
00:11:45,324 --> 00:11:46,473
Where are we moving this time?

65
00:11:49,844 --> 00:11:51,721
We are not moving anywhere

66
00:12:15,364 --> 00:12:17,878
Tokyo, Japan

67
00:13:47,564 --> 00:13:53,355

68
00:13:55,084 --> 00:13:56,961
Just hold on a second

69
00:14:15,764 --> 00:14:16,594

00:14:24,084 --> 00:14:24,960
Come on in

71
00:14:30,524 --> 00:14:31,434
This is it

72
00:14:39,284 --> 00:14:41,718


73
00:14:42,724 --> 00:14:44,555


74
00:14:44,604 --> 00:14:46,435
That is when you left to Japan

75
00:14:49,764 --> 00:14:52,437
very well then

76
00:14:54,244 --> 00:14:56,280

Where do I sleep?

78
00:15:01,084 --> 00:15:02,836


79
00:15:03,084 --> 00:15:05,075
It is either this or the prison

80
00:15:07,084 --> 00:15:09,518


81
00:15:11,244 --> 00:15:11,835


82
00:15:16,284 --> 00:15:18,115
Look, no of us ask for this

83
00:15:19,284 --> 00:15:21,081
But I have promised you mother
to take care of you

84
00:15:22,644 --> 00:15:25,078


85
00:15:25,764 --> 00:15:27,083


86
00:15:27,844 --> 00:15:30,039
Rules?
-Yes, rules!

87
00:15:30,084 --> 00:15:31,278

00:16:55,004 --> 00:16:55,880
You got to be kidding

95
00:17:50,564 --> 00:17:51,360


96
00:17:54,924 --> 00:17:59,401
Wrong train, I am new here

107
00:18:19,324 --> 00:18:22,077


108
00:18:22,524 --> 00:18:25,163

Men.

152
00:23:24,864 --> 00:23:26,775
The only thing they concern 
is who got the biggest engine

153
00:23:28,464 --> 00:23:30,341
I'm a guy, this is in my DNA

Don't you mean 'wabaki'?

157
00:23:43,484 --> 00:23:44,200
Neela, right?

158
00:23:45,804 --> 00:23:46,793
You are learning fast

159
00:23:50,644 --> 00:23:51,793
Where do you come from?

160
00:23:52,164 --> 00:23:52,801
Here

161
00:23:53,884 --> 00:23:56,478
Not where you live now
But where you are born

162
00:23:56,884 --> 00:23:58,283
Thus it really matter?

163
00:24:06,924 --> 00:24:07,913
Who is that tourist?

164
00:24:11,484 --> 00:24:12,712

166
00:24:16,924 --> 00:24:19,119


167
00:24:24,684 --> 00:24:25,753

00:24:35,884 --> 00:24:37,317
Sorry, I dont speak Japanese

172
00:24:41,764 --> 00:24:44,324
Do you understand that?

173
00:24:47,164 --> 00:24:47,960
We were just talking

174
00:24:48,324 --> 00:24:49,279


175
00:24:51,004 --> 00:24:53,723


176
00:24:55,684 --> 00:24:56,639
What thus that mean?

177
00:24:59,204 --> 00:25:03,720
It means, turn around.
and keep walking

178
00:25:04,764 --> 00:25:06,482
That is exactly what we are doing!


179
00:25:06,724 --> 00:25:07,713
That is Yakuza

180
00:25:08,324 --> 00:25:08,836

If it doesn't work right here, you are going to jail!

241
00:33:45,684 --> 00:33:46,241

00:37:30,244 --> 00:37:31,154
Only if you teach me how to drift

268
00:37:32,184 --> 00:37:33,050
Is this a negotiation?

269
00:37:34,664 --> 00:37:36,540
I wasn't negotiate

270
00:38:14,324 --> 00:38:14,881

273
00:38:30,764 --> 00:38:31,640
Hope he not do driving, huh?

00:38:35,684 --> 00:38:36,116
'Gaijin'.. .

275
00:38:38,084 --> 00:38:40,644
When is the next race?
I do really like to be there

276
00:38:43,084 --> 00:38:43,721
Why not be in it?

277
00:38:44,844 --> 00:38:47,881


278
00:38:49,764 --> 00:38:50,241
You heard me

279
00:38:52,084 --> 00:38:53,483
Why blow another car, han?

280
00:38:54,724 --> 00:38:56,840
I am ready to take that 
86Corolla from you hand

281
00:38:59,764 --> 00:39:00,355
Alright

282
00:39:01,604 --> 00:39:03,083

283
00:39:04,404 --> 00:39:05,075

We got business to discuss

287
00:39:27,964 --> 00:39:28,999
What is the rate?

288
00:39:30,044 --> 00:39:32,443
Since when you worried so much
about the detail?

289
00:39:34,884 --> 00:39:36,476
When is the driving, han?

290
00:39:39,084 --> 00:39:40,199
let me handle it

291
00:40:03,484 --> 00:40:05,600
Hey dad, it is me

292
00:40:05,644 --> 00:40:09,637
I have to stay at school for 
some extra-corruricular activities

293
00:40:09,684 --> 00:40:14,235
So, I will be home a little bit later

294
00:40:14,284 --> 00:40:15,594
Sir

295
00:40:17,644 --> 00:40:21,000
You really need to stop following me around

296
00:40:21,044 --> 00:40:23,239
What do you doing here?

297
00:40:23,284 --> 00:40:27,721

298
00:40:27,764 --> 00:40:30,961
Trust me, you don't want to a 
part of this world

299
00:40:31,004 --> 00:40:33,040
It is good enough for you

300
00:40:33,084 --> 00:40:35,234
Your don't know anything about me

301
00:40:35,284 --> 00:40:37,559
Why do you think I don't?

302
00:40:37,604 --> 00:40:41,199
Cause I am a 'gaijin'? 
an outsider?

303
00:40:41,244 --> 00:40:43,439
Let me guess

304
00:40:43,484 --> 00:40:48,638
your are normal lady, move around a lot .
Mom and daddy was never home

305
00:40:48,684 --> 00:40:51,756
So you end up piss off all the time

306
00:40:51,804 --> 00:40:58,323


307
00:40:58,364 --> 00:41:03,108
See you for one, cowboy

308
00:41:12,404 --> 00:41:18,115
Why cant you find a nice japanese girl like 
the rest white guy around here?

309
00:41:18,164 --> 00:41:21,634
Nissan Fairlandy 350Z

310
00:41:21,684 --> 00:41:22,912
Does everything OK back there?

311
00:41:24,724 --> 00:41:25,918
I can handle DK.

312
00:41:27,244 --> 00:41:28,597
And the Yakuza?

313
00:41:29,924 --> 00:41:31,198
his uncle is Yakuza

314
00:41:32,844 --> 00:41:34,721
He is just playing gangster in his storage room

315
00:41:38,804 --> 00:41:39,554
I need him

316
00:41:41,244 --> 00:41:43,439


317
00:41:44,844 --> 00:41:45,674
What do you mean?

318
00:41:47,644 --> 00:41:50,761


319
00:41:51,524 --> 00:41:52,513


320
00:41:53,844 --> 00:41:56,642
50% of esomething is better than
100% of nothing

321
00:41:59,724 --> 00:42:01,123
So, you will be race D.K.?

322
00:42:02,364 --> 00:42:05,117
Why not? see that girl?

323
00:42:05,164 --> 00:42:06,438
She is the point of the race

324
00:42:08,284 --> 00:42:10,320
See if I am better than others guy

325
00:42:10,724 --> 00:42:12,442
Just prove you faster

326
00:42:12,684 --> 00:42:15,244
The race is something important

327
00:42:16,044 --> 00:42:17,841


328
00:42:20,324 --> 00:42:22,042
Why are you letting me race?

329
00:42:22,284 --> 00:42:24,240
Because you are D.K. creep tonight

330
00:42:26,164 --> 00:42:27,882
And you owe me a car

331
00:42:52,884 --> 00:42:54,636
197 Km/h

332
00:42:59,284 --> 00:43:00,433
What the?

333
00:43:00,484 --> 00:43:02,679
Police's cars are just a factory tube.

334
00:43:03,084 --> 00:43:05,644
If you can do better than 180k, 
they will never catch you

335
00:43:05,684 --> 00:43:08,278
They dont even try

336
00:43:10,444 --> 00:43:11,797
Do you know what?

337
00:43:11,844 --> 00:43:14,074

349
00:44:45,484 --> 00:44:46,121
All these ladies...they look like..

352
00:44:51,844 --> 00:44:54,597


353
00:44:54,644 --> 00:44:57,556
It becomes also always more tiring

354
00:44:57,604 --> 00:45:00,721


355
00:45:00,764 --> 00:45:03,278


356
00:45:03,324 --> 00:45:05,713


357
00:45:05,764 --> 00:45:09,643


358
00:45:09,884 --> 00:45:11,237
Yes

359
00:45:11,444 --> 00:45:13,799
I dont just think outside the box,

360
00:45:13,844 --> 00:45:15,243

367
00:46:25,404 --> 00:46:26,361
What do you mean?

368
00:46:28,484 --> 00:46:29,280
You represent me now

369
00:46:30,204 --> 00:46:31,762
what do you think? 
I gonna let you roll in a Hyundai?

370
00:47:06,764 --> 00:47:08,436


371
00:47:12,044 --> 00:47:15,161
My mother, she is playing in one eye,
and she can did better than that

372
00:47:16,644 --> 00:47:19,754
Han, where did you find this guy?

373
00:47:20,004 --> 00:47:22,643

What happened?

377
00:48:01,284 --> 00:48:05,914
I dont know
I just found him

378
00:48:08,924 --> 00:48:14,874
It got potential

379
00:48:15,484 --> 00:48:22,242
Yeah maybe, we will see


380
00:48:22,844 --> 00:48:31,828


381
00:48:34,784 --> 00:48:36,080
You gonna be late

382
00:48:48,024 --> 00:48:48,814

385
00:49:11,784 --> 00:49:12,261


386
00:49:20,944 --> 00:49:21,535
This must be some misunderstanding

387
00:49:23,144 --> 00:49:24,179


388
00:49:25,984 --> 00:49:26,461


389
00:49:27,064 --> 00:49:27,382


390
00:49:27,904 --> 00:49:28,973
I do refund right?

391
00:49:29,664 --> 00:49:30,494


392
00:49:37,304 --> 00:49:37,781
here

393
00:49:39,264 --> 00:49:40,492
try not to break this

394
00:49:56,464 --> 00:49:57,943
Say man!
what is wrong with you, huh?

395
00:49:58,744 --> 00:50:00,541


396
00:50:01,504 --> 00:50:02,061
Damn!!

397
00:50:15,504 --> 00:50:16,983
not easy saving the day, is it?

398
00:50:18,304 --> 00:50:19,578
Maybe you can give me some ponders

399
00:50:21,304 --> 00:50:22,293
You are doing fine

400
00:50:24,304 --> 00:50:24,975
Thanks

401
00:50:28,584 --> 00:50:29,300
hey

402
00:50:33,184 --> 00:50:34,299
Sorry about last time

403
00:50:36,144 --> 00:50:37,372
Your life isn't in my business

404
00:50:39,704 --> 00:50:40,341


405
00:51:05,904 --> 00:51:06,620
Foul!

406
00:51:07,304 --> 00:51:07,941
No it isn't!

407
00:51:09,024 --> 00:51:09,456
Han!

408
00:51:12,584 --> 00:51:13,858
What do I look like? a zebra?

409
00:51:21,304 --> 00:51:22,896


410
00:51:25,424 --> 00:51:31,276
like cowboy make around for their border?

411
00:51:34,224 --> 00:51:35,373
This is my Mexico

412
00:51:39,784 --> 00:51:42,028
why you let me drive your car?

413
00:51:42,424 --> 00:51:43,550
you know I gonna wrecked it

414
00:51:44,984 --> 00:51:46,005
Why not?

415
00:51:47,184 --> 00:51:48,253
Because that a lot of money

416
00:51:49,624 --> 00:51:50,420
I have money

417
00:51:52,784 --> 00:51:55,634


418
00:51:57,244 --> 00:52:00,294


419
00:52:03,504 --> 00:52:08,554
that's the price I can live with.

420
00:52:13,464 --> 00:52:14,943
Look all those people down there

421
00:52:17,384 --> 00:52:18,499
Those follow the rules for what?

422
00:52:20,444 --> 00:52:21,583


423
00:52:24,064 --> 00:52:25,179
What happens if it is not this way?

424
00:52:27,184 --> 00:52:28,537
Very simple

425
00:52:29,744 --> 00:52:31,462
you make choices and you dont look back

426
00:52:46,624 --> 00:52:49,058
So, if you dont drift to win,
what are you drift for?

427
00:52:50,784 --> 00:52:51,455
You really want to know?

428
00:52:52,824 --> 00:52:53,256
Yes

429
00:52:54,384 --> 00:52:55,214
OK, let go

430
00:53:28,864 --> 00:53:35,539
Nissan Skyline GT-R

431
00:54:13,464 --> 00:54:15,632


432
00:54:16,184 --> 00:54:17,694


433
00:54:18,304 --> 00:54:21,349


434
00:54:23,664 --> 00:54:24,460
So feel it!

435
00:54:37,564 --> 00:54:38,441
Again!

436
00:54:41,044 --> 00:54:42,081
What in those bags?

437
00:54:42,604 --> 00:54:43,591
You will see it

438
00:54:43,964 --> 00:54:46,273


439
00:54:50,724 --> 00:54:52,555
You are the pimp, man

440
00:55:00,724 --> 00:55:01,281
Again!

441
00:55:23,884 --> 00:55:24,361
Again!

442
00:55:26,124 --> 00:55:27,079
Hey

443
00:55:34,444 --> 00:55:34,876
Watch it!

444
00:55:35,324 --> 00:55:36,473


445
00:55:43,244 --> 00:55:44,677
Go Go Go 

446
00:55:54,164 --> 00:55:55,358
Not bad!

447
00:55:56,324 --> 00:55:57,723
Dont lose grip!

448
00:56:36,284 --> 00:56:36,761


449
00:56:38,004 --> 00:56:39,073


450
00:56:43,364 --> 00:56:44,080


451
00:56:51,964 --> 00:56:52,680
Get this man a bunk

452
00:58:08,444 --> 00:58:08,876
That the way to do business

453
00:58:13,244 --> 00:58:14,677
Well this way!

454
00:58:34,084 --> 00:58:35,233
bama_boy : how come i never c u drift?

455
00:58:43,684 --> 00:58:44,878
  : because you never ask!

456
00:58:56,084 --> 00:58:56,880
Certainly not bad

457
00:58:58,244 --> 00:58:59,313


458
00:59:00,844 --> 00:59:01,993


459
00:59:04,764 --> 00:59:05,594
I hate that word

460
00:59:06,884 --> 00:59:08,158
They use to call me when I was a kid

461
00:59:10,484 --> 00:59:12,439
I thought you were born here

462
00:59:12,644 --> 00:59:13,156
Well

463
00:59:13,484 --> 00:59:15,963


464
00:59:20,684 --> 00:59:22,402
My mother died when I was 10

465
00:59:24,084 --> 00:59:26,644


466
00:59:27,964 --> 00:59:29,283


467
00:59:29,764 --> 00:59:31,079


468
00:59:35,384 --> 00:59:37,534
DK's granmother took me in ...

469
00:59:40,404 --> 00:59:42,076
My parents have separated when I was 3

470
00:59:44,404 --> 00:59:46,042
me and mom moves around a lot
 
471
00:59:47,284 --> 00:59:48,494
mostly because of me

472
00:59:51,204 --> 00:59:52,593
In fact it was all because of me.

473
00:59:54,044 --> 00:59:55,875


474
00:59:56,884 --> 00:59:58,823


475
01:00:01,204 --> 01:00:03,839


476
01:00:06,684 --> 01:00:07,973


477
01:00:09,964 --> 01:00:10,953


478
01:00:32,084 --> 01:00:33,358


479
01:00:35,044 --> 01:00:37,035


480
01:00:37,444 --> 01:00:40,675


481
01:00:48,244 --> 01:00:49,233


482
01:00:54,204 --> 01:00:56,240


483
01:00:57,484 --> 01:00:59,156


484
01:01:00,284 --> 01:01:02,593


485
01:01:04,564 --> 01:01:05,599
The day I got my license is also
the day I got my first speeding ticket

486
01:01:05,964 --> 01:01:07,363


487
01:01:08,644 --> 01:01:10,202
The day after I won my first race

488
01:01:11,444 --> 01:01:13,116


489
01:01:14,804 --> 01:01:15,475


490
01:01:16,644 --> 01:01:17,394


491
01:01:19,244 --> 01:01:20,359


492
01:01:21,244 --> 01:01:22,597
Everything between us are a dream

493
01:01:25,124 --> 01:01:26,193
No past
No future

494
01:01:27,284 --> 01:01:27,841
No problems

495
01:01:30,564 --> 01:01:31,474
Just the moment

496
01:01:56,164 --> 01:01:56,755
Sim

497
01:02:00,044 --> 01:02:01,272
can you change the tire set

498
01:02:02,124 --> 01:02:02,874
Wow

499
01:02:03,524 --> 01:02:04,161
Another set?

500
01:02:04,644 --> 01:02:06,874
No, that is your third set today

501
01:02:07,284 --> 01:02:08,034


502
01:02:19,644 --> 01:02:22,238


503
01:02:23,884 --> 01:02:24,282
Come on, man

504
01:02:37,884 --> 01:02:38,760
Stay away from her

505
01:02:39,964 --> 01:02:44,435


506
01:02:49,084 --> 01:02:50,039
Find yourself a new driver

507
01:03:03,844 --> 01:03:05,185
I'm alright

508
01:03:05,444 --> 01:03:06,834
What do you expect?

509
01:03:07,084 --> 01:03:08,114
You play with fire

510
01:03:08,464 --> 01:03:10,083
And throws yourself with gasolin

511
01:03:34,284 --> 01:03:35,332
It over

512
01:03:56,164 --> 01:03:57,392
call yourself a 'gaijin'?

513
01:03:58,044 --> 01:03:59,274
I am a 'gaijin'!

514
01:04:02,324 --> 01:04:03,472
you have change DK

515
01:04:09,564 --> 01:04:10,953
You say I have changed

516
01:04:13,524 --> 01:04:14,957


517
01:04:17,284 --> 01:04:19,036


518
01:04:26,244 --> 01:04:27,279


519
01:04:27,844 --> 01:04:30,312


520
01:04:32,644 --> 01:04:33,633


521
01:04:34,484 --> 01:04:37,442


522
01:04:38,644 --> 01:04:39,997


523
01:04:41,724 --> 01:04:44,113


524
01:04:59,444 --> 01:05:00,354
We are the same

525
01:05:05,284 --> 01:05:07,673
Difference is I know who I am
and where I am from

526
01:05:13,884 --> 01:05:15,078
Do you know who you are?

527
01:05:18,564 --> 01:05:19,280
Do you know who you really are?

528
01:05:21,364 --> 01:05:22,353


529
01:05:47,724 --> 01:05:48,236
come on

530
01:06:32,584 --> 01:06:33,175


531
01:06:36,144 --> 01:06:39,181


532
01:06:40,704 --> 01:06:42,774


533
01:06:43,184 --> 01:06:43,775


534
01:06:44,984 --> 01:06:46,542

535

Plus, you cannot just walk into Kamada's
place man!

605
01:19:46,504 --> 01:19:48,504
That is all I got

606
01:19:55,104 --> 01:19:56,378
There is something that i think Han 
want you to have

607
01:20:12,464 --> 01:20:13,396
What this?

608
01:20:15,384 --> 01:20:17,340

615
01:21:47,659 --> 01:21:49,659
You have come to a wrong place

616
01:21:49,766 --> 01:21:51,766
I didn't come here to see you

617
01:21:54,043 --> 01:21:55,743


618
01:21:57,420 --> 01:21:59,020


619
01:21:59,805 --> 01:22:01,805


620
01:22:01,873 --> 01:22:04,573


621
01:22:22,384 --> 01:22:22,975
You think

622
01:22:24,584 --> 01:22:27,382
You can walk in here with some cash

623
01:22:27,984 --> 01:22:28,973
And walk out

624
01:22:31,544 --> 01:22:33,774
I only return what belong to you
in the first place sir

625
01:22:37,064 --> 01:22:38,179
that is not why I really came

626
01:22:39,464 --> 01:22:41,056
I come here to apologize

627
01:22:43,624 --> 01:22:46,741
I know your nephew and I embaress
ourself badly

628
01:22:47,624 --> 01:22:49,137


629
01:22:50,744 --> 01:22:51,381


630
01:22:53,184 --> 01:22:55,254


631
01:22:56,184 --> 01:22:56,775


632
01:22:59,744 --> 01:23:02,702
Sir, I come here to offer you a piece
of solution

633
01:23:05,984 --> 01:23:07,940
How do you plan to accomplish that?

634
01:23:09,784 --> 01:23:10,580
A race

635
01:23:16,184 --> 01:23:18,175
D.K. and I cause nothing but trouble for you

636
01:23:19,384 --> 01:23:19,975
For us

637
01:23:21,984 --> 01:23:23,975
I'm asking you to allow us to settle this

638
01:23:24,744 --> 01:23:26,176
Once and for all

639
01:23:27,784 --> 01:23:28,455
We race

640
01:23:31,064 --> 01:23:32,543


641
01:23:33,064 --> 01:23:34,543


642
01:23:35,984 --> 01:23:36,336
Good

643
01:23:38,104 --> 01:23:39,935
That should be easy

644
01:24:18,784 --> 01:24:19,739
The cops have got the cars

645
01:25:38,824 --> 01:25:39,540


646
01:26:03,664 --> 01:26:04,574
we almost there

647
01:26:05,584 --> 01:26:06,778
just a little more tweak

648
01:26:08,584 --> 01:26:10,699
It is not the car i'm worry about

649
01:26:11,864 --> 01:26:13,536
D.K. pick this road for a reason

650
01:26:14,784 --> 01:26:15,580
This is a mountain

651
01:26:18,184 --> 01:26:19,697
It is where nobody ever make it to the bottom

652
01:26:44,184 --> 01:26:47,654
Dead Charger

653
01:34:53,144 --> 01:34:54,702


654
01:35:30,444 --> 01:35:32,162
Hey, shawn

655
01:35:33,244 --> 01:35:33,960

656
01:35:35,164 --> 01:35:36,916
there is someone over here
want to race our new DK

657
01:35:39,244 --> 01:35:41,474
heard that to be all people around asia too

658
01:35:41,964 --> 01:35:42,874
Not tonight, Twink

659
01:35:47,284 --> 01:35:48,560
he said he knew Han

660
01:35:55,364 --> 01:35:56,883
said Han was family

661
01:36:11,204 --> 01:36:11,681
alright

662
01:36:13,004 --> 01:36:14,356
Let race!

663
01:36:23,204 --> 01:36:29,154
Dead Charger

664
01:36:40,764 --> 01:36:41,860
nice ride

665
01:36:43,084 --> 01:36:45,279
I wonder if my friend Han have to 
use it years ago

666
01:36:48,084 --> 01:36:49,433
I didn't know he was in 
the Amerika's muscles

667
01:36:50,844 --> 01:36:52,596


668
01:36:56,044 --> 01:36:57,477
Notice I know a 10 seconds race

669
01:36:58,884 --> 01:37:00,203
I got nothing but time

670
01:37:04,564 --> 01:37:05,280
You ready kid?

671
01:37:20,004 --> 01:37:20,993
Ready!

672
01:37:24,364 --> 01:37:25,435
Set!

673
01:37:30,164 --> 01:37:30,866
Go!

674
01:37:33,364 --> 01:37:40,103
