the same time distortion.

163
00:12:14,901 --> 00:12:17,700
The captain of the Lalo described it
as a hiccup.

164
00:12:17,904 --> 00:12:19,030
- Hiccup?
DATA: Actually, sir,

165
00:12:19,197 --> 00:12:20,915
that may be an incorrect analogy.

166
00:12:21,115 --> 00:12:22,162
PICARD:
How so, Data?

167
00:12:22,367 --> 00:12:25,337
A hiccup is a spasmodic inhalation
with closure of the glottis,

168
00:12:25,536 --> 00:12:27,379
accompanied by a peculiar sound.

169
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:30,299
If we were to continue this analogy
to a body function,

170
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:32,719
- what occurred would be best--
- Enough, Data.

specifics about the Manheim project?

All I have found, sir,
is what you already know.

173
00:12:38,758 --> 00:12:41,602

time/gravity experiments when he left.

I don't know exactly what happened.

So many brilliant, wonderful minds

Do you know the nature
of Dr. Manheim's work?

252
00:17:04,524 --> 00:17:06,572
Paul's always been interested in time.

253
00:17:07,318 --> 00:17:09,036
He's never believed
that it was immutable

254
00:17:09,195 --> 00:17:11,664
any more than space is immutable.

255
00:17:11,864 --> 00:17:14,117
Over the last decade,
he came to believe

256
00:17:14,325 --> 00:17:17,295
that we reside
in one of infinite dimensions,

257
00:17:17,495 --> 00:17:20,544
and what holds us here
is the constancy of time.

258
00:17:20,748 --> 00:17:24,218
Change that, and it would be
what he called “opening the window"

00:17:24,418 --> 00:17:25,795
to those other dimensions.

Have you been experiencing
something up here'?

Yes. What is emanating here is
having repercussions light years away.

263
00:17:36,472 --> 00:17:38,065
Maybe even further.

264
00:17:38,266 --> 00:17:40,564
That would explain his anxiety.

265
00:17:40,768 --> 00:17:43,897
I had no idea it had gone so far
beyond Vandor.

266

Why this place? Why Vandor?

267
00:17:46,232 --> 00:17:49,156
All I can tell you about that
is that Paul and the rest of the team

268
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:51,112
searched for two years to find it.

269
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:53,618
Vandors exactly what they needed.

270
00:17:53,823 --> 00:17:55,450
A planetoid around a binary star.

271
00:17:55,658 --> 00:17:57,626
Because of the dense gravity
of the pulsar?

272
00:17:57,827 --> 00:18:01,673
Did your husband ever attempt
to define these dimensions

273
00:18:01,872 --> 00:18:03,715
to give you an idea
of what he expected?

274
00:18:03,916 --> 00:18:09,969
No. But he did say that he was
very close to proving his theories.

275
00:18:10,381 --> 00:18:12,008
And then the accident.

276
00:18:12,758 --> 00:18:15,978
Did he anticipate that these
experiments might be dangerous?

277
00:18:16,178 --> 00:18:17,896
I didn't think so.

278
00:18:18,097 --> 00:18:22,318
But now, in retrospect,
he probably did.

279
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:27,236
That would explain the unusual
precautions he began taking.

280
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:29,238
Even before the accident.

281
00:18:29,817 --> 00:18:33,822
The force field,
the elaborate security system.

282
00:18:34,030 --> 00:18:36,032
And every time
he started a new experiment,

283
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:39,835
he insisted that I stay
in what he called "a protected room."

284
00:18:39,994 --> 00:18:41,996
Aha. And that's why
you weren't affected.

285
00:18:42,204 --> 00:18:46,584

do anything to hurt anyone.

Yes, I believe that.

But as he saw his goal getting closer,
seeming possible,

288
00:18:52,548 --> 00:18:54,801
he became
more and more obsessive.

We have completed a scan

completely destroyed.

near Manheim's remaining laboratory.

to risk anyone else.

It is reasonable, sir. After all,

control the effects of a time distortion.

Oh, I see, sir. That is quite true, sir.

I see time as a constant, whereas
humans perceive time as flexible.
