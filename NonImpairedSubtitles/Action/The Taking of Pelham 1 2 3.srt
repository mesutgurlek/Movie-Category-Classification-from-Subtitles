So.

4
00:01:21,081 --> 00:01:24,062
And so I'm sitting there,
Sydney is in there right?

5
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:27,138
and he tells me to get my fucking, crunchy 
fuckmeister the fuck outta there..

6
00:01:27,139 --> 00:01:28,197
Believe that shit?

7
00:01:28,198 --> 00:01:31,467
- You know what I said, right?
- No. What did you say?

8
00:01:33,968 --> 00:01:35,025
Shit!

9
00:01:35,026 --> 00:01:38,006
- All right, man!
- That was good, man! Very good!

<i>Control Center, this is</i>

12
00:02:09,041 --> 00:02:11,272
Bridge street station being 
delayed by a red signal light.

13
00:02:13,195 --> 00:02:15,311
Should be green, 12-15.

14
00:02:15,312 --> 00:02:17,907
Tell me something I don't already know.

15
00:02:17,908 --> 00:02:21,680
Alright, roll forward slow. Extreme 
caution, follow the rule book.

16
00:02:31,274 --> 00:02:34,637
Yeah! we're at the rail, 900ft 
from the east end of the platform.

17
00:02:34,734 --> 00:02:37,526
The goddamn cold, metal 
contracts. You know that...

18
00:02:37,627 --> 00:02:39,734
I got it, I got it. How long 
will it take to fix it?

19
00:02:39,735 --> 00:02:42,563
Gonna put the blade 
on it, two hours.

20
00:02:43,102 --> 00:02:46,177
Thank you. Make it an hour 
and a half. I'll buy you a beer.

21
00:03:13,991 --> 00:03:17,231
Shit, GB! I hate to see you 
down here on the floor, man.

22
00:03:17,232 --> 00:03:20,883
It's temporary baby. I'll be up there
behind the glass before you know it.

23
00:03:33,864 --> 00:03:37,613
Okay I'm gonna need the R train
to switch over at the express tracks at 34.

24
00:03:37,902 --> 00:03:39,344
Which express tracks?

25
00:03:39,441 --> 00:03:42,037
The one that Q uses once 
they exit 57 street station

26
00:03:42,134 --> 00:03:44,439
and switch over to the F line, 
boom straight shot into Queens.

27
00:03:44,632 --> 00:03:47,615
Once you get to Queens, they 
switch back at 36 street to the R line.

28
00:03:47,712 --> 00:03:49,637
All he's got to do is suspend to W


29
00:03:49,734 --> 00:03:52,038
him and I will pick up the slack. Alright?

30
00:04:34,724 --> 00:04:37,222
Excuse me, I can't 
see where I gotta look.

31
00:04:37,223 --> 00:04:39,626
Unlock the door. Do it 
or I'll fucking kill you!

32
00:04:41,646 --> 00:04:43,280
Alright! Alright!

33
00:05:03,086 --> 00:05:04,143
Shut up and walk!

34
00:05:04,529 --> 00:05:05,779
First close the window!

35
00:05:06,452 --> 00:05:07,508


36
00:05:16,354 --> 00:05:18,181
See. I told you, you could do this.

37
00:05:18,471 --> 00:05:20,873
Big fucking deal. You did 
what you'd say you'd do!

38
00:05:42,986 --> 00:05:46,139
- Ahh!
- Yeah!

39
00:05:48,082 --> 00:05:49,535
Nice!

40
00:05:57,223 --> 00:06:00,106
- Come on, it's really nice. I still got you.
- You still got me.

41
00:06:01,153 --> 00:06:02,991
- Ok!

Gata... Gata...

45
00:07:07,027 --> 00:07:10,688
Give me the cutting key.

50
00:07:43,949 --> 00:07:45,872
You got green ahead..

51
00:07:45,873 --> 00:07:46,930
It's okay.

52
00:07:48,565 --> 00:07:53,372
Life is simple now.
They just have to do what I say.

53
00:07:57,315 --> 00:07:59,046
Not now, okay!

54
00:08:13,563 --> 00:08:15,293
Where are you from?

55
00:08:15,390 --> 00:08:18,851
- Brooklyn.
- Irish?

56
00:08:18,852 --> 00:08:22,025
- Yeah.
- I thought so.

57
00:08:23,276 --> 00:08:25,198
Who's driving, Pelham 1-2-3?

58
00:08:29,621 --> 00:08:31,928
Maybe something fell on the tracks.

59
00:08:46,447 --> 00:08:47,791


60
00:09:15,197 --> 00:09:17,405
What is it? Are we going back?

61
00:09:32,688 --> 00:09:35,765

63
00:09:39,036 --> 00:09:42,207
Listen up. We need to 
stop and stay in station all,

64
00:09:42,208 --> 00:09:45,285
southbound locals just 
north of 51st street station.

65
00:09:45,286 --> 00:09:47,593
The operator on 123 is, Jerry Pollard.

66
00:09:47,883 --> 00:09:51,344
Jerry Pollard... I know, Jerry Pollard, I

What's going on, 1-23?

70
00:10:01,827 --> 00:10:05,383
Lets get an express train to go up, pull
along side 'em, see what we see in the cab

71
00:10:05,481 --> 00:10:07,022
Yeah this is, south ferry 1-05.

72
00:10:07,023 --> 00:10:08,847
I can't get my 
windshield wiper to turn on.

73
00:10:09,327 --> 00:10:12,884
South Ferry 1-05, there's a circuit 
breaker right behind you for that.

74
00:10:12,885 --> 00:10:15,961
What's going on? Maestro,

75
00:10:32,594 --> 00:10:35,574
- Cop...
- Oh fuck!

76
00:10:36,536 --> 00:10:38,651
When I say "stop", stop it hard.

77
00:10:42,595 --> 00:10:44,517
- Transit police!
- Stop!

78

Get the fuck down!

80
00:11:03,459 --> 00:11:06,439
Jesus! we're getting reports of 
gunshots down in the tunnel.

81
00:11:06,632 --> 00:11:09,036
Sergeant Rian. Delgado let's 
call off that express.

82
00:11:09,037 --> 00:11:10,095
Got it!

83
00:11:10,576 --> 00:11:12,499
Stay down!

84
00:11:12,692 --> 00:11:15,862
Cops, every fucking time.

00:11:16,346 --> 00:11:19,710
Everybody up
facing the window!

86
00:11:19,711 --> 00:11:22,596
Stand up! Stand up!

87
00:11:23,174 --> 00:11:25,575


88
00:11:25,576 --> 00:11:27,403
Move it.

89
00:11:29,423 --> 00:11:30,961
What the fuck is going on?

90
00:11:30,962 --> 00:11:34,521
It was a cop. Bashkim shot him.
I think... I think he's dead.

91
00:11:34,522 --> 00:11:36,828
Put, Bashkim on and 
find some fucking guts!

92
00:11:37,021 --> 00:11:39,422
- Do it!
- God.

93
00:11:40,676 --> 00:11:43,752
- What happened?
- A cop. He's dead.

94
00:11:43,753 --> 00:11:46,060
Put the conductor on.

95
00:11:46,157 --> 00:11:48,561
- What's your name, conductor?
- Regina.

96
00:11:48,657 --> 00:11:51,349
Regina baby, listen. You 
got a job to do, honey.

97
00:11:51,447 --> 00:11:52,600
A job?

98
00:11:52,889 --> 00:11:56,254
Yeah, god put you on this earth
for one thing and one thing only.

99
00:11:56,255 --> 00:11:59,620
Your going to get those people off the 
train and up to the platform station.

100
00:11:59,621 --> 00:12:02,023
You got that? Let me hear it.
Let me here you do that.

101
00:12:03,852 --> 00:12:06,928
Listen up everybody! We're 
gonna go back to the platform.

102
00:12:07,025 --> 00:12:08,660
I need everybody to...

103
00:12:08,757 --> 00:12:12,218
Regina! Let's do it again.
Conduct those people!

104
00:12:12,604 --> 00:12:15,295
Listen up everybody! Now we're 
gonna head back towards the platform.

105
00:12:15,488 --> 00:12:18,661
I want everybody to slowly get up, 
I'm gonna get you off this train.

106
00:12:18,758 --> 00:12:19,911
Good!

107
00:12:19,913 --> 00:12:24,046
Now we're gonna be on the tracks, 
so if you don't need it! Leave it.

108
00:12:47,992 --> 00:12:49,818
Every cop in the city's on the way.

109
00:12:49,819 --> 00:12:53,472
Maybe it wasn't even gun shots. I mean
the train could have broken it's breakers right.

110
00:12:53,857 --> 00:12:56,741
No, this is on purpose.

111
00:12:56,838 --> 00:12:57,921
Come on you!

112
00:12:58,018 --> 00:13:01,954
- Yeah I'm coming!
- Shut the fuck up and come on!

113
00:13:06,515 --> 00:13:10,299
- Ramos, turn the power off a lane down.
- What?

114
00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:14,619
- Turn the power off a lane down.
- Okay, I got it.

115
00:13:17,797 --> 00:13:20,105
What a fucking lucky day.

116
00:13:22,124 --> 00:13:23,182
Oh shit!

117
00:13:23,183 --> 00:13:25,488
What the fuck is wrong with you, man!

118
00:13:36,161 --> 00:13:38,564


119
00:13:41,065 --> 00:13:44,526
<i>Pelham 1-2-3, to rail control centre</i>
<i>do you read me?</i>

120
00:13:46,834 --> 00:13:50,679
Yes, I read you, Pelham 1-2-3.
This is control center.

121
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:52,122
Who is this?

122
00:13:53,181 --> 00:13:57,122
It's me, man! I didn't wanna 
call until everything was ready.

123
00:14:00,391 --> 00:14:04,525
I understand, I understand, 
Pelham 1-2-3. Who the hell is this?

124
00:14:04,526 --> 00:14:06,738
This is the man, who's 
gonna rock this city.

125
00:14:06,739 --> 00:14:09,431
This is the man who's gonna 
give this city a run for it's money.

126
00:14:09,432 --> 00:14:12,603
Now look up. Look up at your screen
and you tell me what you see.

127
00:14:12,604 --> 00:14:15,969
- You see what I done?
- I see it.

128
00:14:15,970 --> 00:14:19,143
One car is much more manageable 
than 10, with  the man power I got. 

129
00:14:19,144 --> 00:14:21,644
Mr motorman's gonna tell you all 
about it, tell 'em what we got here.

130
00:14:21,645 --> 00:14:25,489
They... they got hostages, lot's of 'em
and... and they got machine guns?

131
00:14:25,490 --> 00:14:26,642
- It's Jerry?
- Yeah.

132
00:14:27,606 --> 00:14:30,586
Yeah, that's right. You check 
that you understand that.

133
00:14:30,587 --> 00:14:32,414
I checked. I understand.

134
00:14:35,010 --> 00:14:36,933
Didn't I tell you to knock first?

135
00:14:36,934 --> 00:14:40,587
Good, because this is what is called
a cash trans-action.

136
00:14:40,588 --> 00:14:43,375
Now you understand 
commodities? Don't you.

137
00:14:43,376 --> 00:14:46,261
You know, pork bellies, gold, crude?

138
00:14:46,262 --> 00:14:48,474
Listen... listen no disrespect 
but... maybe... Maybe 

139
00:14:48,475 --> 00:14:50,589
I'm not the guy you 
should be talking to.

140
00:14:50,590 --> 00:14:53,377
Oh no, you are exactly the guy 
I wanna talk to. Now I want

141
00:14:53,378 --> 00:14:55,493
you to look at the ticker and 
you tell me what is the going rate

142
00:14:55,494 --> 00:14:58,475
for a new york hostage today?

143
00:14:59,823 --> 00:15:01,649
Do you think million 
dollars is too much? I do?

144
00:15:01,650 --> 00:15:05,591
I think it's corny. Get your 
calculator out, you got one.

145
00:15:08,188 --> 00:15:11,169
- You don't have a calculator?
- Yeah, we got one. I got one.

146
00:15:11,266 --> 00:15:17,033
Okay, good. Add this up, you got
526 thousand $315 and seventy-nine cents.

147
00:15:17,130 --> 00:15:23,283
This is 526,315.79. 
Now times that by 19.

148
00:15:23,284 --> 00:15:27,033
- What you got?
- Who is he? A goddamn accountant?

149
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:32,033
That's 10 million.

150
00:15:32,322 --> 00:15:35,303
- What you got?
- That comes up to 10 million, plus 1 cent.

151
00:15:35,304 --> 00:15:38,669
That is a deal! Now you call the 
mayor and tell him the price.

152
00:15:38,670 --> 00:15:42,514
And you tell him I want 100 
thousand and $100 bills, you got that.

153
00:15:42,515 --> 00:15:44,919
I got it. What about the 1 cent?

154
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:46,843
Well you keep that 1 cent, 
that's your brokers fee.

155
00:15:46,844 --> 00:15:51,932
now I want the rest, in plain suitcases the kind with 
the wheels and the deportable handle. Okay.

156
00:15:51,933 --> 00:15:55,283
Now this is not a futures 
contract this is a spotre,

157
00:15:55,284 --> 00:15:58,100
that means there's a time limit 
on it. Okay you got that?

158
00:15:58,435 --> 00:16:00,930
What do you think is a fair, time limit?

159
00:16:03,194 --> 00:16:05,715
You know, I don't know, 
I mean, I'm really just a guy

160
00:16:05,716 --> 00:16:08,378
Come on give me a time limit.
Give me a fair time limit.

161
00:16:10,778 --> 00:16:11,834
Thursday.

162
00:16:11,835 --> 00:16:15,030
I was thinking more like an hour, 
now what does your watch say?

163
00:16:16,953 --> 00:16:18,169
2:13.

164
00:16:18,170 --> 00:16:21,007
Oh that's exactly what 
my watch says! So at 3:13

165
00:16:21,008 --> 00:16:23,449
I want that money here, mother fucker.

166
00:16:23,718 --> 00:16:26,034
and after that, there is a late fee.

167
00:16:26,407 --> 00:16:28,903
What do you think that 
late fees going to be?

168
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:33,678
Come on, tell me what will it be.

169
00:16:34,489 --> 00:16:37,355
Your going to kill... the passengers.

170
00:16:37,356 --> 00:16:39,856
Oh commodities is 
what I will start to kill.

171
00:16:39,857 --> 00:16:42,059
One for every minute past the 
dead line, I am forced to wait.

172
00:16:42,060 --> 00:16:45,324
They become more valuable this 
way, they still have the same price.

173
00:16:45,325 --> 00:16:48,301
He's only rattleing, he's 
never gonna pull this off.

174
00:16:48,302 --> 00:16:50,510
Don't tell me, tell him.

175
00:16:50,511 --> 00:16:52,239
- Who the hell is this guy?
- I don't know who it is!

176
00:16:52,336 --> 00:16:53,977
Garber. Just stay with it.

177
00:16:54,065 --> 00:16:56,849
What's your name? I didn't get your 
name, what's your name my man?

178
00:16:56,849 --> 00:16:58,481
- My name?
- What's your name?

179
00:16:59,250 --> 00:17:03,817
Tell him? Garber.

180
00:17:03,818 --> 00:17:05,875
Garber, okay. Now seriously, man.

181
00:17:05,876 --> 00:17:08,660
In 59 minutes, I'm gonna 
start killing passengers.

182
00:17:08,761 --> 00:17:12,313
So my advice to you, get on the 
phone and get the mayor notified, now!

183
00:17:12,314 --> 00:17:15,001
Listen, I mean, I'm just 
a civil service employee,

184
00:17:15,002 --> 00:17:16,535
I can't get hold of the mayor.

185
00:17:16,536 --> 00:17:18,264
Well that's your problem man, 
that's not mine! That's like,

186
00:17:18,457 --> 00:17:21,433
Who's responsible for who
lives and who dies in, new york?

187
00:17:21,434 --> 00:17:22,873
That's the, new york city's problem!

188
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:26,761
Get the fuck of the radio and 
notify the mayor, mother fucker!

189
00:17:28,156 --> 00:17:29,212
Okay.

190
00:17:39,001 --> 00:17:40,825
Nine months of this and I'm free.

191
00:17:41,113 --> 00:17:44,286
Next may, I'll get inaugurated be 
sitting in central bay on the beach,

192
00:17:44,287 --> 00:17:47,627
with a piña colada and I will never 
have to ride the subway ever again!

193
00:17:47,715 --> 00:17:49,951
- Never say never, sir.
- Never!

194
00:17:51,008 --> 00:17:53,216
Alright. What's next for the afternoon?

195
00:17:53,217 --> 00:17:57,057
East harlem elementary at 2:30 you were supposed 
to read "A cat in the hat" to the third grade.

196
00:17:57,250 --> 00:17:59,554
Everytime I go to the schools, I get sick.

197
00:17:59,651 --> 00:18:02,339
They all have runny nose's. 
Call Dr. Katz tell him, 

198
00:18:02,340 --> 00:18:05,412
I want him waiting at 
the school with a flu shot.

199
00:18:23,461 --> 00:18:26,821
- He's in car 3.
- Yeah.

200
00:18:28,166 --> 00:18:29,318
What happened?

201
00:18:29,319 --> 00:18:31,239
Somebody just hijacked a 6 train.

202
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:33,832
It stopped in the tunnel between.
Between 51st and 22nd.

203
00:18:33,929 --> 00:18:36,041
Another idiot with a gun

204
00:18:36,042 --> 00:18:39,018
- What do we know?
- It's not clear but, I have a car waiting for us downstairs.

205
00:18:39,019 --> 00:18:41,035
The subway will get us there faster.

206
00:18:41,036 --> 00:18:45,067
Alright. Have the doors closed,
tell them will meet them at 59 street.

207
00:18:50,252 --> 00:18:52,556
Tell the conductor this is now an express. 

208
00:18:52,557 --> 00:18:53,997
We're skipping the next 5 stops.

209
00:18:53,998 --> 00:18:55,726
- What?
- This is not right!

210
00:18:55,727 --> 00:18:58,607
Hold on, hold on. Everybody 
will get where they need to go, 

211
00:18:58,608 --> 00:19:00,624
we'll make all the stops.

212
00:19:00,625 --> 00:19:02,929
Maybe he's not such a 
douchebag after all, huh?

213
00:19:03,410 --> 00:19:04,754
That's funny!

214
00:19:07,923 --> 00:19:10,707
I think you should be the 
one to get a call like this.

215
00:19:10,708 --> 00:19:13,108
The negotiating team
will be here in 5 minutes

216
00:19:13,109 --> 00:19:14,741
and the mayor's been notified.

217
00:19:14,742 --> 00:19:16,661
- Gonna tell him?
- Get the fuck out of here!

218
00:19:16,662 --> 00:19:19,350
- My shift's over in 10 minutes.
- What are you staring at?

219
00:19:19,352 --> 00:19:22,328
Your face, trying to remember 
it for when it's not here anymore.

220
00:19:22,329 --> 00:19:23,865
You going to start in on me now?

221
00:19:23,866 --> 00:19:26,650
Damn right I'm going to start in 
on you. Don't fuck this up, Garber!

222
00:19:26,650 --> 00:19:27,778
You wanna do it?

223
00:19:27,864 --> 00:19:30,072
- It's your station, it's your call.
- Oh, it's my call now?

224
00:19:30,073 --> 00:19:31,944
That's right, your call.

225
00:19:38,173 --> 00:19:41,533
Pelham 1-2-3, come in, this is rail 
control centre. Are you there?

226
00:19:42,015 --> 00:19:44,703
Gerber, baby boy! What's up?

227
00:19:45,376 --> 00:19:49,118
"Garber". Just wanted to let you 
know the, mayor's been notified.

228
00:19:49,119 --> 00:19:51,425
Think he'll pay?

229
00:19:51,426 --> 00:19:54,264
I don't know. I'm just the... a...
what did you call me? The broker.

230
00:19:54,361 --> 00:19:57,720
No! no ,no you represents the
city of new york right now, buddy!

231
00:19:57,817 --> 00:20:00,792
Well, I can tell you that your dealing 
with one of the old time bureaucracy.

232
00:20:00,889 --> 00:20:02,136
I know that, I mean it takes time.

233
00:20:02,233 --> 00:20:03,936
Well, then you better 
fix the bureaucracy,

234
00:20:03,937 --> 00:20:05,361
because when the time comes,

235
00:20:05,377 --> 00:20:09,048
these motherfuckers, these
hostages are gonna go real quick!

236
00:20:11,124 --> 00:20:13,828
You got it. You got it. 
Any other demands?

237
00:20:13,829 --> 00:20:15,672
Yeah well no fucking 
pizza for 'em either, man!

238
00:20:15,768 --> 00:20:18,646
No, I mean... are you guys like terrorist's?

239
00:20:18,647 --> 00:20:21,662
Do I sound like a terrorist?
Do I terrorize you?

240
00:20:21,719 --> 00:20:24,983
Actually, you don't but um... 
not that I've ever talked to one.

241
00:20:25,036 --> 00:20:29,068
So... So... What? 
This is just about money?

242
00:20:29,069 --> 00:20:32,237
- Oh is there anything else?
- There's not dying...

243
00:20:32,238 --> 00:20:35,022
Yeah, well... you know you live you 
die, you either go with the current,

244
00:20:35,023 --> 00:20:37,039
or you bite and you all 
end up in the same place.

245
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:38,192
Where's that, Jersey?

246
00:20:38,193 --> 00:20:40,017
Yeah, you watch it. 
I was born there man.

247
00:20:40,018 --> 00:20:41,746
No, no I'm just saying...

248
00:20:41,747 --> 00:20:44,243
You're up in the motorman's cab so 
it means you know your on the radio, 

249
00:20:44,244 --> 00:20:46,356
which means that 
your an easy target...

250
00:20:46,357 --> 00:20:47,701
You gotta know the drill.

251
00:20:49,526 --> 00:20:52,886
Yeah, I know that soon I won't be 
alone and if I'm the first to get shot.

252
00:20:52,887 --> 00:20:54,753
I'm the first of many to get shot!

253
00:20:54,791 --> 00:20:57,167
That's correct, but then 
you'll still be dead.

254
00:20:57,168 --> 00:21:00,791
Death is an improvement on alot of 
things I can think of, buddy boy!

255
00:21:00,888 --> 00:21:02,711
Sounds like he slept with my ex.

256
00:21:04,219 --> 00:21:07,867
You know we all owe, god a death.
I'm a man who pays his debt's.

257
00:21:07,868 --> 00:21:10,076
are you a man who pay's his debt's?

258
00:21:10,077 --> 00:21:13,852
Yeah, yeah, sure... TV, cable, and my mortgage... 
That's a little like dying once a month.

259
00:21:13,896 --> 00:21:14,974
This is only a part.

260
00:21:14,975 --> 00:21:17,111
Oh you're married!
You're a married man.

261
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:21,431
- Maybe...
- No, you're married, man!

262
00:21:21,527 --> 00:21:23,639
Married men have mortgages.

263
00:21:23,927 --> 00:21:25,655
What about you? 
You got a mortgage?

264
00:21:25,751 --> 00:21:28,439
I don't know, Garber. Why don't you 
tell me and then we'll both know?

265
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:31,765
I do not know... I mean you, I'm sure 
someone out there loves you dearly and a...

266
00:21:32,417 --> 00:21:34,986
you know would 
be worried about you.

267
00:21:35,351 --> 00:21:38,999
Like I said, your in the motorman's 
cab, you got no covers, cops on the way...

268
00:21:39,224 --> 00:21:41,984
You know circumstances are "my" protection,

269
00:21:41,985 --> 00:21:43,492
Cause right now, you know...

270
00:21:43,493 --> 00:21:46,277
hostages are a good insurance, 
by the way I see it.

271
00:21:46,277 --> 00:21:48,101
I'm pretty well protected.

272
00:21:50,327 --> 00:21:52,362
You know this reminds me 
of being in a confession.

273
00:21:53,290 --> 00:21:56,842
Are you a, catholic? I'm 
married, are you a catholic?

274
00:21:56,843 --> 00:21:58,091
Maybe... I don't know.

275
00:21:58,092 --> 00:22:00,608
Your a catholic and a 
catholic, a good catholic

276
00:22:00,609 --> 00:22:03,171
would know that his got a 
train load of innocent people.

277
00:22:03,172 --> 00:22:05,202
I mean you don't want to kill
innocent people, do you?

278
00:22:05,203 --> 00:22:07,791
A good, catholic knows 
that know body is innocent.

279
00:22:07,792 --> 00:22:11,248
and I'm not going to kill all these 
hostages and give up my leverage.

280
00:22:15,473 --> 00:22:17,681
No. I hope you know, what you're doing.

281
00:22:17,682 --> 00:22:19,794
Yeah well it's running like 
a swiss watch down here.

282
00:22:19,795 --> 00:22:21,523
So don't worry about it.

283
00:22:23,156 --> 00:22:24,788
So, what do I call you, anyway?

284
00:22:26,037 --> 00:22:27,669
Call me, Ryder.

285
00:22:27,669 --> 00:22:29,397
As in "train rider"?

286
00:22:29,494 --> 00:22:32,470
Call me with Ryder...
with a "Y". Ryder...

287
00:22:35,063 --> 00:22:38,038
I like you, Garber!
I do like you, man.

288
00:22:38,232 --> 00:22:40,728
You may be the last 
friend I ever make.

289
00:22:41,686 --> 00:22:43,827
Well, I hope your wrong, Mr. Ryder.

290
00:22:43,828 --> 00:22:45,776
But uh... you know I'm just a guy...  

291
00:22:45,777 --> 00:22:48,214
I'm just a guy on the 
other end of the mike.

292
00:22:49,270 --> 00:22:51,094
Oh, you don't think 
this was meant to be?

293
00:22:51,095 --> 00:22:53,405
you don't think this 
was fate, you and me?

294
00:22:55,357 --> 00:22:58,390
I don't know, you know, things 
happen that lead to other things...

295
00:22:58,391 --> 00:23:01,078
and maybe this was one 
of them but a... thats it,

296
00:23:01,079 --> 00:23:03,382
I never... get excited about coincidence.

297
00:23:03,958 --> 00:23:06,425
Well you got 50 fucking 
minutes, so check me.

298
00:23:07,126 --> 00:23:09,142
That's right, 50 minutes. Check.

299
00:23:09,143 --> 00:23:11,254
Then don't call me, unless you got news.

300
00:23:11,255 --> 00:23:13,817
- You got it.
- Mother fucker!

301
00:23:14,230 --> 00:23:17,398
GB, you're fucking good, man!

302
00:23:21,430 --> 00:23:23,350
Okay, move it the other way.

303
00:23:27,862 --> 00:23:28,966
Alright, come on move it!

304
00:23:28,976 --> 00:23:30,387
The other way!

305
00:23:34,390 --> 00:23:36,406
Peter, move it back a little less.

306
00:23:37,654 --> 00:23:40,054


307
00:23:41,110 --> 00:23:42,166
Got it!

308
00:23:42,262 --> 00:23:44,301
All right! We got it!

309
00:23:54,838 --> 00:23:58,006


310
00:24:16,342 --> 00:24:19,126
- Who's talked to these jokers?
- That would be me.

311
00:24:19,126 --> 00:24:21,113
Under my supervision, who are you?

312
00:24:21,114 --> 00:24:23,925
Lieutenant Camonetti, 
NYPD, hostage negotiations.

313
00:24:23,926 --> 00:24:25,893
John Johnson, chief transportation officer

314
00:24:25,894 --> 00:24:29,503
Walter Garber. I'm a... 
consult dispatch. Right now

315
00:24:29,504 --> 00:24:30,772
What can you tell me, Walter?

316
00:24:30,773 --> 00:24:33,525
His name is, Ryder, 
with a "Y" and a...

317
00:24:33,909 --> 00:24:36,501
his asking for 10 million dollars by 3:13.

318
00:24:36,502 --> 00:24:38,935
- Good, he's looking towards the future.
- Right.

319
00:24:38,936 --> 00:24:41,048
Did he say what he'd do if 
he doesn't get the money?

320
00:24:41,049 --> 00:24:43,449
Yeah, he said he'd kill a passenger, 
every minute we go over.

321
00:24:43,546 --> 00:24:45,946
- Starting at 3:13 pm?
- Yes, sir.

322
00:24:45,947 --> 00:24:47,733
- Anything else?
- He's smart...

323
00:24:47,734 --> 00:24:50,642
If he's so smart, why's he 
got himself, so fucking stupid?

324
00:24:50,661 --> 00:24:53,013
- Is he on the train radio?
- Yeah, yeah. We can get him right here.

325
00:24:53,014 --> 00:24:54,578
Any chance we can get 
a signal down there?

326
00:24:54,963 --> 00:24:56,211
We'd like to get him on 
one of our cell phones.

327
00:24:56,499 --> 00:24:58,677
No. No there's no chance, 
not where he is. uh-uh.

328
00:24:59,295 --> 00:25:02,463
What's this, leverage, stock trade?

329
00:25:02,464 --> 00:25:05,685
Yeah, it's weird, he's like a 
money guy, like wall street.

330
00:25:05,686 --> 00:25:08,757
he talked about the passengers
like they were... commodities.

331
00:25:08,758 --> 00:25:10,914
- Catholic?
- Yes, I think he's, catholic.

332
00:25:10,915 --> 00:25:14,229
For christ sake, Garber! you gonna 
tell us what he's zodiac sign is?

333
00:25:14,325 --> 00:25:16,629
No, I'm just saying in my 
opinion I think he's, catholic.

334
00:25:16,630 --> 00:25:19,821
He asked me if the guy is catholic. I wrote 
it down. I'm giving him my opinion.

335
00:25:19,918 --> 00:25:21,909
Unlike other people around 
here, I actually have an opinion....

336
00:25:22,006 --> 00:25:23,829
Fellas, can we settle this 
domestic dispute... later?

337
00:25:24,118 --> 00:25:25,701
- Absolutely!
- Why do you think he's, catholic?

338
00:25:25,702 --> 00:25:29,048
Well, I think he's, catholic because 
he talked about original sin, 

339
00:25:29,137 --> 00:25:31,855
confession, and I don't know, I just wrote 
it down, I didn't know what else to do.

340
00:25:32,095 --> 00:25:33,462
- Did he ask for a priest?
- No.

341
00:25:33,525 --> 00:25:35,596
Good anything else?

342
00:25:36,749 --> 00:25:39,285
Yeah, he sounded like... 
the way he was talking

343
00:25:39,286 --> 00:25:41,234
sounded like he's not afraid to die.

344
00:25:42,261 --> 00:25:43,317
Yeah well, it's early yet.

345
00:25:44,086 --> 00:25:45,814
Calls coming through, uh...

346
00:25:45,815 --> 00:25:48,131
Yes, sir, right here. You 
hit the blue button here 

347
00:25:48,132 --> 00:25:50,037
you can reach him and 
it'll come back to you.

348
00:25:50,038 --> 00:25:51,304
You mind if I take your seat?

349
00:25:51,305 --> 00:25:53,938
- No, no, go ahead!
- Thank you, Walter.

350
00:25:54,515 --> 00:25:57,203
this one here is six lines you 
don't have to press that one.

351
00:25:57,204 --> 00:25:58,836
- that one goes around the whole room.
- Okay.

352
00:25:58,837 --> 00:26:02,101
- Why don't you, uh...
- Just hit the talk here and, uh...

353
00:26:02,102 --> 00:26:04,533
Walter, remove the rest of 
the day off, get out of here.

354
00:26:04,630 --> 00:26:07,414
I thought, I'll stick around 
here... Make sure that...

355
00:26:07,415 --> 00:26:11,639
That wasn't a suggestion.
So, why don't you go home?

356
00:26:39,671 --> 00:26:41,111
Can I take a piss?

357
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:43,032
- So who's stopping you?
- alright,

358
00:26:44,473 --> 00:26:47,262
I don't want to end up on
any amnesty international list, so

359
00:26:47,263 --> 00:26:49,087
step up to the door, face out.

360
00:26:49,952 --> 00:26:51,200
Open the middle door.

361
00:26:52,353 --> 00:26:54,452
Do what you gotta do.

362
00:26:56,317 --> 00:26:58,590
Can I jump down, there?

363
00:27:10,111 --> 00:27:12,788
- You gotta go, or don't you??
- I do, I gotta go!

364
00:27:13,365 --> 00:27:15,189
Step up my, man!

365
00:27:15,382 --> 00:27:17,014
Lets go! Lets go!

366
00:27:25,943 --> 00:27:27,860
That kids going places.

367
00:27:27,861 --> 00:27:28,917
Alright close the doors!

368
00:27:29,013 --> 00:27:32,277
<i>Pelham 1-2-3, come in.</i>
<i>Pelham 1-2-3, please come in.</i>

369
00:27:32,374 --> 00:27:34,484
Alright, everybody sit down!

370
00:27:44,757 --> 00:27:45,908
Who is this?

371
00:27:45,909 --> 00:27:49,191
This is, Lieutenant Camonetti, I'm with 
the, NYPD hostage negotiation team.

372
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:52,820
I'd like to talk to you 
about this situation that we're in.

373
00:27:52,821 --> 00:27:54,069
Where the fuck is, Garber?

374
00:27:54,070 --> 00:27:57,140
Mr. Garber is a train dispatcher
this, then this is now a police matter...

375
00:27:57,141 --> 00:27:58,676
I want to talk to, Garber!

376
00:27:58,677 --> 00:28:01,949
I'm sorry, Mr Ryder, but Mr
Garber is no longer involved.

377
00:28:04,148 --> 00:28:05,502
Stand!

378
00:28:07,028 --> 00:28:08,287
Put, Garber on the line!

379
00:28:08,288 --> 00:28:10,400
To be honest, Mr Garber has gone home.

380
00:28:10,401 --> 00:28:12,980
Put, Garber on the fucking 
line, or I kill the motorman!

381
00:28:14,708 --> 00:28:17,709
I guarantee you, Mr. Ryder... that 
I am the best person for you to be

382
00:28:18,210 --> 00:28:20,468
talking to right now, just give me 
a moment and I'l explain why.

383
00:28:20,468 --> 00:28:22,964
I always knew you were going 
to be the first one to go.

384
00:28:31,027 --> 00:28:34,819
Mr. Camonetti, youv'e got 60 
fucking seconds before I kill another.

385
00:28:34,820 --> 00:28:37,220
Okay? 59... 58...

386
00:28:37,221 --> 00:28:38,277

388
00:28:40,775 --> 00:28:43,271
Mr Garber, ASAP, Mr. Ryder. 
Why did you do that, ?

389
00:28:43,368 --> 00:28:46,683
Mr. Camonetti, or whatever fucking 
grease ball name you got...

390
00:28:46,876 --> 00:28:48,892
the city of fucking new york

391
00:28:49,084 --> 00:28:52,636
53... 52... 51...

392
00:28:55,805 --> 00:28:57,341

00:28:57,342 --> 00:28:58,494

396
00:29:04,641 --> 00:29:06,273
He's here! He's on the way!

397
00:29:07,234 --> 00:29:09,826

399
00:29:13,091 --> 00:29:16,579
5... 4... 3... 2...

400
00:29:16,964 --> 00:29:18,788
Hey it's me! It's, Garber!

401
00:29:18,789 --> 00:29:19,845
Garber!

402
00:29:19,846 --> 00:29:21,574
You didn't say goodbye!

403
00:29:23,347 --> 00:29:26,951
- You killed, Jerry.
- The city of fucking new york killed, Jerry okay?

404
00:29:26,952 --> 00:29:31,219
The biggest rat-hole in 
the world fucking killed, Jerry!

405
00:29:31,220 --> 00:29:34,387
Okay? Now you can chuck 
another victim up to, NYC.

406
00:29:34,388 --> 00:29:37,459
- Now can everybody hear me?
- Yeah we here you, loud and clear.

407
00:29:37,460 --> 00:29:39,764
Well good, now you don't 
have to tell the cops

408
00:29:39,765 --> 00:29:42,933
they don't tell me how to do it, or how 
it's going to be! I'll fucking tell them.

409
00:29:42,934 --> 00:29:47,827
Don't you ever, ever leave me again,
or, I'll hunt you down and I'll kill you!

410
00:29:47,828 --> 00:29:48,884
Now,

411
00:29:48,885 --> 00:29:50,709
you got 39.

412
00:29:51,478 --> 00:29:53,302
39 minutes, check me.

413
00:29:54,359 --> 00:29:55,991
39, check.

414
00:30:05,107 --> 00:30:07,411
ESU 2. What's your position?

415
00:30:07,412 --> 00:30:10,100
ESU 2: we're approaching hostage 
car from the south tunnel.

416
00:30:10,101 --> 00:30:11,541
Go, go, go!

417
00:30:13,557 --> 00:30:16,435
$10 million! Let's just write him 
a check and get it over with.

418
00:30:16,436 --> 00:30:19,315
- He wants it in cash.
- I was joking, LaSalle.

419
00:30:20,372 --> 00:30:23,252
We've been given 1 hour 
to get the money together.

420
00:30:23,253 --> 00:30:25,653
$10 million! Where do 
they get these numbers?

421
00:30:25,654 --> 00:30:27,574
Actually ten's the limit, Sir.

422
00:30:27,575 --> 00:30:30,743
- Why is that?
- We just sign a request to the city control

423
00:30:30,744 --> 00:30:35,736
he forges it to one of our lenders, cash get's released to 
the federal reserve. Limit at any one time, is 10 million.

424
00:30:36,409 --> 00:30:39,097
Well some idiot with a gun wouldn't 
know that. I didn't know that.

425
00:30:39,098 --> 00:30:41,882
- Well you're very busy, sir.
- How do you know that?

426
00:30:43,131 --> 00:30:44,379
Here he is.

427
00:30:44,669 --> 00:30:47,549
- Henry, what's the situation?
- They just killed a hostage.

428
00:30:47,550 --> 00:30:49,566
Bitch of a way to find out, but 
these guys may be the real deal.

429
00:30:49,759 --> 00:30:51,967
Guys? I thought it was one 
idiot with a gun, who are...? 

430
00:30:51,968 --> 00:30:55,136
Multiple gunmen. We don't know, they're 
not sure. They got 18 hostages they say 

431
00:30:55,137 --> 00:30:58,305
they'll kill more in an hour, that's 
the time limit. They want you to know.

432
00:30:58,306 --> 00:31:00,034
- What do we know about them?
- They're not amateurs... They cut out a car

433
00:31:00,035 --> 00:31:03,106
stopped a rise in the tunnel, they can see 
us coming a 100 yards either way.

434
00:31:03,107 --> 00:31:05,219
How long to get the money together.

435
00:31:05,220 --> 00:31:06,276
I don't know.

436
00:31:06,277 --> 00:31:08,101
- Find out.
- Your not thinking of paying these, pricks are you?

437
00:31:08,102 --> 00:31:09,926
I'm thinking of buying time and being ready.

438
00:31:09,927 --> 00:31:11,079
Call the controller,

439
00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:13,672
tell him we'll pay them.

440
00:31:14,921 --> 00:31:16,745
What's with you and, Garber, 
huh? Tell me about him.

441
00:31:16,746 --> 00:31:18,762
- Was he scheduled to work today?
- Yeah, absolutely.

442
00:31:18,763 --> 00:31:19,819
But...

443
00:31:19,820 --> 00:31:23,084
- But what?
- He's only had this particular job, a couple of weeks.

444
00:31:23,085 --> 00:31:25,773
- Why is that?
- He's under investigation.

445
00:31:25,774 --> 00:31:28,654
- What?
- We're gonna suspend him, with pay...

446
00:31:28,655 --> 00:31:30,575
What's he being investigated for?

447
00:31:33,138 --> 00:31:38,322
We went to, Japan, he had a look at some 
trains and the allegation is that he took a bribe.

448
00:31:38,323 --> 00:31:41,425
- Took a bribe. does he have a previous record?
- No. Not that I know of.

449
00:31:41,426 --> 00:31:43,446
- Your sure of that.
- Yeah, I don't think so. I gotta take this.

450
00:31:43,546 --> 00:31:46,802
<i>The identity of the 
hijackers is still unclear</i>

451
00:31:46,803 --> 00:31:50,835
<i>the hostage negotiating team has 
just arrived at the, MTA headquarters</i>

452
00:31:51,028 --> 00:31:54,292
<i>to determine if this 
is a terrorist enterprise</i>

453
00:31:54,293 --> 00:31:56,597
Is that what we are? an enterprise?

454
00:31:59,346 --> 00:32:00,882
We're an enterprise!

455
00:32:03,091 --> 00:32:08,178
Well, our little enterprise 
has begun it's descent.

456
00:32:14,706 --> 00:32:17,107
ESU 4, what's your, ETA?

457
00:32:17,107 --> 00:32:19,219
Approximately two minutes from the target.

458
00:32:20,276 --> 00:32:22,626
Why's the train called, Pelham 1-2-3?

459
00:32:23,202 --> 00:32:25,698
It comes at, Pelham Bay 
at 1:23 in the afternoon.

460
00:32:26,179 --> 00:32:28,049
How did you end up with this call?

461
00:32:28,050 --> 00:32:30,642
It's a lexington avenue train

462
00:32:30,643 --> 00:32:33,139
and I got the lexington avenue 
desk. It came through my desk.

463
00:32:33,140 --> 00:32:36,060
Can you think of any reason, 
why you would be targeted? 

464
00:32:36,099 --> 00:32:38,133
someone would wanna hurt you?
Something against you or something.

465
00:32:38,134 --> 00:32:39,574
No.

466
00:32:46,193 --> 00:32:47,729
Yoy recognize the voice?

467
00:32:48,690 --> 00:32:53,105
No. As I said, it was a coincidence
that it came through my desk.

468
00:32:54,258 --> 00:32:57,425
Did you pick this desk, or 
was it assigned to you?

469
00:32:58,923 --> 00:33:00,018
Did I?

470
00:33:00,595 --> 00:33:03,473
I said, did you pick this desk, 
or was it assigned to you?

471
00:33:09,425 --> 00:33:10,750
Can I take my coat off?

472
00:33:10,751 --> 00:33:11,903


473
00:33:13,728 --> 00:33:16,032
- Doesn't make any sense!
- What doesn't?

474
00:33:16,033 --> 00:33:18,721
The guy your talking to,
he isn't a train dispatcher.

475
00:33:18,722 --> 00:33:20,258
Walter Garber.

476
00:33:20,643 --> 00:33:22,865
- He's a big shot.
- Big-shot of what?

477
00:33:22,866 --> 00:33:26,322
Rail control, he runs things up there.
Atleast he did before I went out.

478
00:33:26,323 --> 00:33:28,435
- His name is Walter?
- Yeah.

479
00:33:29,876 --> 00:33:32,276
Dude like that shouldn't 
be answering the phone?

480
00:33:38,513 --> 00:33:41,105
- Mr. Ryder wants to talk to you.
- Right.

481
00:33:41,682 --> 00:33:44,465
Are you sure you don't have
some sort of relationship with him?

482
00:33:44,466 --> 00:33:47,057
I'm sure whatever 
relationship I have with him

483
00:33:47,058 --> 00:33:48,402
is better than yours.

484
00:33:48,594 --> 00:33:51,646
Jerry, my friend was killed
while "you" were talking to, Ryder.

485
00:33:51,647 --> 00:33:54,623
So maybe that's a question you should 
be asking yourself, instead of asking me

486
00:33:54,623 --> 00:33:56,831
- I didn't have anything to do with this.
- I didn't say that.

487
00:33:56,832 --> 00:33:58,961
This, Mr. Garber,
is an unknown variable.

488
00:33:58,962 --> 00:34:00,114
- An unknown variable?
- That's right

489
00:34:00,115 --> 00:34:01,939
and peoples lives are at stake.

490
00:34:01,940 --> 00:34:03,668
- I understand that.
- So, please excuse me if I 

491
00:34:03,669 --> 00:34:05,013
try to get more comfortable 
with you, okay?

492
00:34:06,069 --> 00:34:07,509
It aint working, but okay.

493
00:34:08,182 --> 00:34:09,334
Alright.

494
00:34:09,623 --> 00:34:13,745
Now with that in mind, would you agree 
to a consensual search of your house?

495
00:34:13,746 --> 00:34:16,338
It would take me 40, 45 
minutes to get a warrant.

496
00:34:21,617 --> 00:34:23,153
Yes, okay.

497
00:34:26,224 --> 00:34:27,290
Got, em.

498
00:34:28,155 --> 00:34:29,979
- Walter Garber.
- Wow

499
00:34:31,216 --> 00:34:32,570
Oh shit, look at this!

500
00:34:33,051 --> 00:34:36,123


501
00:34:36,784 --> 00:34:38,224
He took a bribe, man.

502
00:34:38,225 --> 00:34:39,377
Yeah.

503
00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:41,604
Woo-hoo, baby!

504
00:34:51,204 --> 00:34:54,064
ESU 2: what is your overall status?

505
00:34:54,065 --> 00:34:55,889
All position's secured.

506
00:34:55,890 --> 00:34:58,002
Alright, hold your fire until instructed.

507
00:35:04,624 --> 00:35:06,899
Pelham 1-2-3
can you hear me?

508
00:35:06,900 --> 00:35:09,012
Yeah, loud and clear, back at ya!

509
00:35:09,973 --> 00:35:12,179
Alright the mayor's agreed to pay and a...

510
00:35:12,564 --> 00:35:14,224
they're getting the money 
together right now.

511
00:35:14,225 --> 00:35:15,281
Good!

512
00:35:15,282 --> 00:35:18,928
Well you know, you got 28 minutes, 
so I'd advise them to make haste.

513
00:35:18,929 --> 00:35:20,081
I'm sure you will.

514
00:35:20,082 --> 00:35:22,098
So, is your first name, Walter?

515
00:35:22,963 --> 00:35:24,883
- Excuse me?
- Your name, is it, Walter.

516
00:35:27,092 --> 00:35:28,532
- Yes it is.
- good.

517
00:35:28,533 --> 00:35:32,464
What are you doing dispatching trains? 
I thought you were some sort of, MTA big-shot?

518
00:35:33,616 --> 00:35:38,496
I worked for the, MTA, today 
they put me in dispatch and uh...

519
00:35:38,609 --> 00:35:41,593
- My bad luck.
- I thought you didn't believe in bad luck.

520
00:35:41,594 --> 00:35:43,994
I said I didn't believe in fate.

521
00:35:43,995 --> 00:35:46,864
do you believe in rig 
contracts for new trains?

522
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:51,069
Look... what we talking about this for?

523
00:35:51,070 --> 00:35:53,854
- I need to know who I'm dealing with.
- You need to know, who your dealing with?

524
00:35:53,854 --> 00:35:57,424
Yeah, I need to know who I'm 
dealing with. Are you a bad penny!

525
00:35:58,097 --> 00:35:59,632
Let me explain something to you.

526
00:36:00,785 --> 00:36:02,992
being accused of 
something is one thing.

527
00:36:02,993 --> 00:36:05,488
Be guilty of it, is 
something entirely different.

528
00:36:05,873 --> 00:36:07,216
I agree, but...

529
00:36:07,217 --> 00:36:08,945
You gotta take me 
through it my, man.

530
00:36:08,946 --> 00:36:10,866
You gotta tell me from the top.

531
00:36:10,867 --> 00:36:12,786
This whole train thing, come on.

532
00:36:16,816 --> 00:36:18,737
Alright, I started out in a... maintenance.

533
00:36:18,737 --> 00:36:21,577
platforms maintenance, track maintenance.

534
00:36:22,634 --> 00:36:24,400
- Conductor.
- Conductor, really?

535
00:36:25,168 --> 00:36:26,416
Yeah and then, motorman.

536
00:36:26,417 --> 00:36:28,815
A motorman? How long 
did you do that for?

537
00:36:29,584 --> 00:36:33,327
I drove them over 6 years, I went 
to operations, assistant dispatcher

538
00:36:33,328 --> 00:36:37,744
- dispatcher, I finally ended up...
- Yeah, your assistant, chief transportation officer or

539
00:36:37,745 --> 00:36:39,761
something, right?

540
00:36:40,146 --> 00:36:41,298
That's right.

541
00:36:42,927 --> 00:36:44,809
And part of my job is to a...

542
00:36:45,002 --> 00:36:50,607
go out to the manufacturers, you know people 
who build the trains and bid on contracts for the trains.

543
00:36:51,184 --> 00:36:53,871
Is that where you took your 
bribe, the Japanese train...

544
00:36:53,872 --> 00:36:57,232
- or the, Canadian train?
- I did not take a bribe, alright?

545
00:36:57,425 --> 00:37:02,415
I was accused of taking a bribe, 
I have not been proven guilty yet.

546
00:37:02,416 --> 00:37:04,816
Well they haven’t said yet, I 
mean they haven't decided yet.

547
00:37:04,817 --> 00:37:07,695
They got no proof. I don't 
care what they decide.

548
00:37:07,696 --> 00:37:10,672
- It don't matter what...!
- Is this when they demoted you?

549
00:37:10,673 --> 00:37:14,127
That's correct, they demoted 
me pending the outcome.

550
00:37:14,128 --> 00:37:16,815
And now, they tying to 
humiliate you, is that, right?

551
00:37:17,392 --> 00:37:18,639
Mother fuckers!

552
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:21,660
I know how these things work, 
man okay. Everything doesn't seem 

553
00:37:21,761 --> 00:37:25,311
to appear like what it is, but you gotta 
be completely honest with me, man.

554
00:37:25,312 --> 00:37:28,239
- I don't know what you're talking about?
- How did you do it?

555
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:29,679
I didn't.

556
00:37:29,776 --> 00:37:31,724
- I'm innocent.
- Oh your innocent?

557
00:37:31,725 --> 00:37:35,835
Look, your talking to a catholic, man 
we've been over innocent before, okay.

558
00:37:36,304 --> 00:37:40,239
I've been through all this, man, so
Just tell me how did you do it!

559
00:37:42,735 --> 00:37:45,231
I didn't do it!

560
00:37:45,232 --> 00:37:47,152
Okay, that's it, that's fucking it!

561
00:37:48,783 --> 00:37:51,087
Kid! You!

562
00:37:51,088 --> 00:37:54,007
- Me?
- No, no, you, up! Up over here.

563
00:37:54,543 --> 00:37:57,135
I don't know what you did 
to piss him-off, but you did.

564
00:37:57,136 --> 00:37:59,890
Garber, do you know 
what I'm looking at?

565
00:37:59,891 --> 00:38:01,523
Do you know what I'm looking at?

566
00:38:01,524 --> 00:38:04,073
- No, I do not.
- First, it's my gun.

567
00:38:04,074 --> 00:38:05,851
At the end of my gun...
What's your name, man?

568
00:38:05,852 --> 00:38:09,187
- George. Everyone calls me, Geo.
- George, his friends call him, Geo.

569
00:38:09,188 --> 00:38:13,359
He's got this 80s skate-board thing going, It make's him 
work, but It's not going to look to good in his casket.

570
00:38:14,224 --> 00:38:17,621
Listen, Ryder, just slow down. We 
haven't reached the deadline.

571
00:38:17,622 --> 00:38:19,311
There's no fucking deadline, man!

572
00:38:19,312 --> 00:38:21,616
You just gotta tell me the truth.

573
00:38:21,616 --> 00:38:24,112
- About what?
- The bribe, did you take it?

574
00:38:24,113 --> 00:38:25,937
I didn't take a bribe!

575
00:38:25,938 --> 00:38:28,050
Okay, you got 5 seconds 
to save this kid's life.

576
00:38:28,051 --> 00:38:30,067
I didn't do anything!

577
00:38:30,068 --> 00:38:31,700
- Five...
- Just wait a second!

578
00:38:31,701 --> 00:38:33,813
- Four... three...
- Wait a second!

579
00:38:34,582 --> 00:38:35,638
Two...

580
00:38:35,639 --> 00:38:37,800
Tell him anything, please!

581
00:38:37,801 --> 00:38:38,857
Alright, okay!

582
00:38:42,986 --> 00:38:44,426
Say it!

583
00:38:44,427 --> 00:38:46,155
I took the bribe.

584
00:38:47,116 --> 00:38:49,996
- How much?
- 30, um...

585
00:38:50,861 --> 00:38:52,109
How fucking much!

586
00:38:53,262 --> 00:38:54,894
35 thousand dollars.

587
00:38:55,375 --> 00:38:56,719
How did you do it?

588
00:38:57,296 --> 00:38:59,792
I went to, Japan to look at these trains,

589
00:39:00,176 --> 00:39:02,000
was part of my job.

590
00:39:02,097 --> 00:39:03,345
I...

591
00:39:03,730 --> 00:39:06,706
I don't get to vote, okay? I just recommend.

592
00:39:08,147 --> 00:39:10,643
I chose what I thought was the...

593
00:39:10,932 --> 00:39:14,676
best train and the, Japanese had the 
best train and I made my recommendation.

594
00:39:15,061 --> 00:39:16,789
Before you took the bribe?

595
00:39:17,078 --> 00:39:18,806
Yes.

596
00:39:18,903 --> 00:39:20,823
That was a train you were 
going to pick anyway, huh?

597
00:39:20,824 --> 00:39:22,168
Yes.

598
00:39:23,129 --> 00:39:26,297
Now your fighting for your job and 
they trying to humiliate you, aren't they?

599
00:39:26,298 --> 00:39:27,738
No, no.

600
00:39:28,795 --> 00:39:31,523
No. I did what I did and um...

601
00:39:33,116 --> 00:39:35,036
and it's not the, MTA's fault.

602
00:39:35,037 --> 00:39:36,861
What did you spend it on?

603
00:39:37,918 --> 00:39:40,030
Look, what has this got 
to do with anything, huh?

604
00:39:40,031 --> 00:39:41,726
What did you fucking spend it on?

605
00:39:41,727 --> 00:39:44,607
I used the money
for my kids, alright!

606
00:39:44,608 --> 00:39:46,528
To pay my childrens tuition.

607
00:39:46,529 --> 00:39:49,217
I have a 17 year old and a 19 year old,

608
00:39:50,946 --> 00:39:54,690
and I used the money to pay
for their college tuition, alright.

609
00:40:02,030 --> 00:40:03,182
You know, Garber...

610
00:40:03,183 --> 00:40:05,295
you're my god-damn 
hero, you know that?

611
00:40:05,296 --> 00:40:08,656
You have a kid here, you don't even 
know him, you saved his life.

612
00:40:09,041 --> 00:40:12,017
That's brave, man!
That's fucking heroic!

613
00:40:13,649 --> 00:40:15,089
Tell, Garber thank you.

614
00:40:15,090 --> 00:40:16,242
Thank you, Garber.

615
00:40:16,243 --> 00:40:18,451
Thank you, Garber
for saving my life.

616
00:40:18,452 --> 00:40:20,660
Thank you, Garber
for saving my life.

617
00:40:23,061 --> 00:40:24,686
Your welcome.

618
00:40:28,045 --> 00:40:29,102
Sit down.

619
00:40:29,967 --> 00:40:31,695
You're just like me, Garber.

620
00:40:31,888 --> 00:40:34,960
I fuel this city, I fed her 
breakfast every morning

621
00:40:34,961 --> 00:40:39,099
and now, we're the bad guys!
I don't think so, I don't fucking think so!

622
00:40:54,733 --> 00:40:55,885
Hello, Therese?

623
00:40:55,886 --> 00:40:58,862
Honey, look, there are, police here at home.

624
00:40:59,055 --> 00:41:02,221
They want to search the house and
they said you said it was okay.

625
00:41:05,197 --> 00:41:09,998
Yeah, yeah, it's okay. Just let them 
in. We've got nothing to hide.

626
00:41:09,999 --> 00:41:12,111
Is this about the investigation?

627
00:41:12,304 --> 00:41:13,456
No, no!

628
00:41:13,457 --> 00:41:14,609
You watching TV?

629
00:41:14,610 --> 00:41:17,394
The hostage thing. Yeah I'm watching it.

630
00:41:17,587 --> 00:41:19,219
Well it's just that uh...

631
00:41:19,604 --> 00:41:21,812
I'll tell you all about it 
when I get home, but...

632
00:41:21,813 --> 00:41:23,541
I'm in the middle of it here right now,

633
00:41:23,542 --> 00:41:27,094
and they just wanna do a background checks on 
everybody that's involved here at the, MTA.

634
00:41:27,095 --> 00:41:28,439
That's why they're at the house.

635
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:30,648
Okay, but your okay?

636
00:41:30,649 --> 00:41:33,517
I'm fine, I'm fine. Just let them in, 
I'll see you when I get home.

637
00:41:34,574 --> 00:41:35,918
Alright, okay. Bye.

638
00:41:36,303 --> 00:41:38,127
I'm sorry, Walter.

639
00:41:38,128 --> 00:41:39,280
I am.

640
00:41:39,761 --> 00:41:42,929
Listen, don't let this guy 
ruin your day's reality.

641
00:41:42,930 --> 00:41:47,058
Because, that's what he wants to do, he hurts you, 
your gonna get angry. His got the advantage.

642
00:41:47,059 --> 00:41:48,307
- You understand?
- Yeah.

643
00:41:48,308 --> 00:41:50,420
Just deflect alright, if you can.

644
00:42:18,541 --> 00:42:20,461
Hope they don't get fucking lost.

645
00:42:26,509 --> 00:42:28,333
Fuck me! Ten million dollars!

646
00:42:30,636 --> 00:42:32,845
The joke is that, if we took some?

647
00:42:32,846 --> 00:42:36,302
The bad guys come up short. Probably, kill us.

648
00:42:36,303 --> 00:42:37,647
No shit!

649
00:42:48,492 --> 00:42:50,604
Geo, what the fucks happening?

650
00:42:52,333 --> 00:42:53,403
Geo?

651
00:42:53,404 --> 00:42:55,228
Geo, what's going on?

652
00:42:57,612 --> 00:42:59,052
Geo?

653
00:43:01,261 --> 00:43:03,564
I'm a fucking hostage.

654
00:43:05,197 --> 00:43:08,940
Listen to me, stream it 
on our site, call the news.

655
00:43:21,900 --> 00:43:23,916
We've gotta do something.

656
00:43:24,205 --> 00:43:25,645
They gonna kill us.

657
00:43:29,110 --> 00:43:30,732
You got a plan?

658
00:43:30,733 --> 00:43:32,365
I thought you'd have one.

659
00:43:39,660 --> 00:43:41,388
Because, I'm a black guy?

660
00:43:42,061 --> 00:43:44,940
I saw that, the ring on your finger.

661
00:43:49,837 --> 00:43:52,140
That was a long time ago, okay?

662
00:43:52,141 --> 00:43:54,349
My husband had one just like it.

663
00:44:00,973 --> 00:44:03,277
<i>The severe market fell,</i>

664
00:44:03,374 --> 00:44:05,486
<i>450 points in trading</i>

665
00:44:05,582 --> 00:44:10,669
<i>as wall street reacts to the terrorist 
attacks of the new york city subway system</i>

666
00:44:17,197 --> 00:44:19,309
- How does my hair look?
- Looks fine.

667
00:44:19,310 --> 00:44:22,966
- Are you ready to make statement?
- I'll make a statement when I have something to tell them.

668
00:44:22,967 --> 00:44:24,877
It's a leadership moment, sir.

669
00:44:24,886 --> 00:44:27,316
I'm not running for re-election, not 
running for fucking, president,

670
00:44:27,317 --> 00:44:29,717
I left my, Rudy Giuliani suit at home.

671
00:44:29,718 --> 00:44:32,982
You're being selfish. It'll take 
30 seconds to reassure them.

672
00:44:46,668 --> 00:44:50,316
We're doing everything the situation demands, 
I'm not going to speculate right now, alright?

673
00:44:59,244 --> 00:45:02,815
Nobody said anything about terrorism, 
or a bomb or anything like that.

674
00:45:02,816 --> 00:45:05,448
- Let's stop that right now, alright?
- How about your, divorce? 

675
00:45:05,905 --> 00:45:08,961
Can you speculate on how's 
that going. The divorce, sir

676
00:45:08,962 --> 00:45:12,802


677
00:45:15,852 --> 00:45:17,676
Put it on channel 15.

678
00:45:17,677 --> 00:45:20,460
We have a girl in, brooklyn watching 
it on her boyfriends computer.

679
00:45:20,461 --> 00:45:22,573
- It's on the damn, internet.
- What?

680
00:45:25,164 --> 00:45:26,335
Hold on!

681
00:45:27,488 --> 00:45:28,716
Son of a bitch!

682
00:45:28,717 --> 00:45:31,405
- That's, Ramos isn't it?
- That's mother fucking, Phil Ramos!

683
00:45:31,406 --> 00:45:33,326
- Who's, Phil Ramos?
- He was a motorman.

684
00:45:33,327 --> 00:45:36,207
He killed couple of passangers, 
what ten years ago, right?

685
00:45:36,208 --> 00:45:40,144
He was high on cough syrup, ran into 
the platform. Went to jail for manslaughter

686
00:45:40,145 --> 00:45:43,596
In 5 minutes I want everything, prison 
time, known associates, the works.

687
00:45:43,597 --> 00:45:45,229
Looks like it's from the floor.

688
00:45:45,230 --> 00:45:47,726
- Should the internet be working down there?
- No, no way.

689
00:45:47,727 --> 00:45:50,415
Maybe that's how he knows about 
you, maybe he, googled you.

690
00:45:50,416 --> 00:45:52,620
Or maybe, Ramos 
told him. Who knows.

691
00:45:55,788 --> 00:45:57,040
God-damn it! It's the, mayor.

692
00:45:57,617 --> 00:45:58,865
Hello, your honour!

693
00:46:01,265 --> 00:46:03,525
Do me a favour, forget about those guys.

694
00:46:03,526 --> 00:46:06,348
- Easy for you to say.
- Would you rather be one of those hostages?

695
00:46:06,349 --> 00:46:07,501
Oh, no!

696
00:46:07,502 --> 00:46:10,958
So listen up, I'l give you a crash 
course in hostage negotiating .

697
00:46:10,959 --> 00:46:12,398
They're like, rodeo clowns.

698
00:46:12,399 --> 00:46:14,895
They keep the bull focusing on 
whatever, they'd like to do.

699
00:46:14,896 --> 00:46:16,912
- Which is what?
- Kill the cowboy.

700
00:46:17,009 --> 00:46:18,833
Exactly. Now he's got he's deadline,

701
00:46:18,835 --> 00:46:20,467
- you slow things down.
- Alright.

702
00:46:20,468 --> 00:46:22,772
preservation of life, that's our mission.

703
00:46:22,773 --> 00:46:25,855
Guy's already proven he's serious, next deadline he's 
going to give you a chance to prove it again.

704
00:46:25,856 --> 00:46:27,296
How do we deal with that?

705
00:46:27,297 --> 00:46:30,081
- Hopefully get the money here on time.
- And if we don't?

706
00:46:30,274 --> 00:46:32,002
We pretend the deadline doesn't exist.

707
00:46:32,290 --> 00:46:33,922
We talk through it, we buy a little 
time, we get a little movement.

708
00:46:33,923 --> 00:46:35,459
- Movement?
- That's right.

709
00:46:35,556 --> 00:46:39,300
He contradict's himself consistency 
in demand, you got some movement.

710
00:46:40,549 --> 00:46:42,443
Alright, let's go out there.

711
00:46:44,843 --> 00:46:48,875
<i>This was the scene just moments ago, 
outside the rail control centre in mid-town</i>

712
00:46:50,796 --> 00:46:53,580
That is a beautiful suit he's got there.

713
00:46:56,173 --> 00:46:59,437
Can't get it out of my 
head, I'm gonna die today,

714
00:47:00,206 --> 00:47:03,470
visualizations a very powerful thing.

715
00:47:03,663 --> 00:47:05,103
- I keep thinking it.
- You never know.

716
00:47:17,387 --> 00:47:20,267
Please let it be me who 
caps this mother fucker!

717
00:47:26,411 --> 00:47:28,331
Hey, Garber? You there, buddy?

718
00:47:30,155 --> 00:47:31,787
Yeah, I'm here.

719
00:47:31,788 --> 00:47:34,187
A little birdie told me
that the mayor just walked in.

720
00:47:34,188 --> 00:47:35,840
Can I talk to him?

721
00:47:38,029 --> 00:47:41,023
- Can he hear me?
- How does he know, I'm here?

722
00:47:41,484 --> 00:47:44,076
- Does he have a camera in here?
- Can he hear me?

723
00:47:44,077 --> 00:47:46,093
Er, we can, we can...

724
00:47:46,478 --> 00:47:48,014
we can all hear you here, yes.

725
00:47:48,687 --> 00:47:50,415
Good, good. Then, tell him er...

726
00:47:50,512 --> 00:47:52,740
Tell him I want to make him a deal.

727
00:47:53,393 --> 00:47:57,233
- Tell him I want to make him a deal, right now.
- Okay, alright.

728
00:47:57,333 --> 00:47:59,345
Well come on speak up, Mr Mayor!

729
00:47:59,346 --> 00:48:04,235
your talking to your constituents, 
we've got a train full of registered voters ?

730
00:48:04,620 --> 00:48:07,539
Don't you care, don't 
you care about your voters?

731
00:48:08,844 --> 00:48:10,283
This is not a good idea your honour.

732
00:48:10,284 --> 00:48:13,836
Don't talk, don't engage with him, I know what I'm 
doing, I've been doing this along time your honour.

733
00:48:14,316 --> 00:48:15,660
Come on, buddy! Speak up!

734
00:48:15,661 --> 00:48:18,252
You gotta hit the blue button 
there, your honour.

735
00:48:20,075 --> 00:48:23,991
- Yes this is the mayor.
- Hey, good to meet you, man!

736
00:48:24,088 --> 00:48:25,240
Hey listen...

737
00:48:25,241 --> 00:48:26,777
tell me this, is this true?

738
00:48:26,874 --> 00:48:31,098
I read that you make like $1 a year 
to be a mayor of new york, is that true?

739
00:48:31,195 --> 00:48:33,750
Yes, but at least
it's honest work.

740
00:48:33,751 --> 00:48:37,027
After taxes, that's like 87 cents, isn't it?

741
00:48:37,592 --> 00:48:39,992
- Uh... yes.
- Don't bullshit me, man!

742
00:48:39,992 --> 00:48:44,132
It would take like 3 thousand years to
pay off that, that suit that your wearing.

743
00:48:44,133 --> 00:48:47,109
What you got, 20, 30 million 
dollars? Something like that?

744
00:48:47,110 --> 00:48:49,702
You don't get that without 
screwing someone.

745
00:48:49,703 --> 00:48:52,679
or screwed everyone, I'm sure your 
wife knows, something about that, huh?

746
00:48:56,362 --> 00:49:00,202
- You said you had a deal for me.
- Yeah I do have a deal. I wanna make you a deal.

747
00:49:00,203 --> 00:49:02,444
I want to tell you, you 
can come down here,

748
00:49:02,445 --> 00:49:07,402
and I will trade you for all 
these passangers in the train, how's that?

749
00:49:10,090 --> 00:49:15,514
Okay? You can save the life of 17 
new yorkers, that's a good deal.

750
00:49:18,299 --> 00:49:20,660
What do you think?

751
00:49:24,021 --> 00:49:27,082
- Give us a moment.
- Okay.

752
00:49:27,563 --> 00:49:29,483
I give you a moment.

753
00:49:29,484 --> 00:49:31,500


754
00:49:31,501 --> 00:49:34,330
If you turn this into a circus, you're 
going to get somebody else killed.

755
00:49:34,331 --> 00:49:36,874
If you enter he's 
world, exit it.

756
00:49:41,962 --> 00:49:45,330
Okay, time's up. What's the deal?

757
00:49:45,611 --> 00:49:48,355
It's a very nice offer but, I'm 
afraid I'm going to have to decline.

758
00:49:48,356 --> 00:49:51,615
Oh good, beacause you were begging I 
wouldn't give you that deal, man!

759
00:49:51,616 --> 00:49:54,781
You think anyone cares about 
a pal brine asshole like you?

760
00:49:54,782 --> 00:49:57,662
the city of new york would love for 
me to pull the fucking trigger on you, brother!

761
00:49:57,663 --> 00:50:00,010
Hey, Garber, man this is the dude

762
00:50:00,107 --> 00:50:01,355
this is the guy who's trying 
to get rid of you my, man?

763
00:50:01,451 --> 00:50:02,507
- Keep talking to him.
- Listen.

764
00:50:02,508 --> 00:50:04,428
- Can you believe this shit?
- You gotta calm...

765
00:50:04,429 --> 00:50:06,637
I mean you don't think he broke 
the same rules that we broke?

766
00:50:06,638 --> 00:50:08,653
He knows, that I know, 
we all fucking know.

767
00:50:08,654 --> 00:50:12,499
- He can eat, shit!
- The speaker... You're breaking up.

768
00:50:12,501 --> 00:50:14,127
You can tell him he 
can fucking kiss my ass...

769
00:50:14,128 --> 00:50:15,952
I liked the deal. I think 
it's a good deal but, you're...

770
00:50:15,953 --> 00:50:17,297
Fuck you, Mr Mayor!

771
00:50:17,298 --> 00:50:21,038
I want my fucking money 
now! You understand me? Now!

772
00:50:21,039 --> 00:50:23,818
- Tell him the money's on the way.
- He got you, the money’s on the way.

773
00:50:23,818 --> 00:50:26,381
Yeah, yeah, he's like 
a used car salesman!

774
00:50:26,382 --> 00:50:28,905
this asshole, he can lick my 
bum hole, motherfucker!

775
00:50:29,386 --> 00:50:31,881
One mistake and everyone
has something to say.

776
00:50:32,362 --> 00:50:34,953
- Was she worth it?
- Yes

777
00:50:35,530 --> 00:50:38,380
You have 9 minutes. How you 
gonna get the money here?

778
00:50:38,481 --> 00:50:40,465
We've got every intersection 
cleared from here to, brooklyn.

779
00:50:48,585 --> 00:50:52,723
Phil Ramos, male, spanic, 
39, sentenced 2 to 4 years for

780
00:50:52,724 --> 00:50:54,638
manslaughter, paroled last month,

781
00:50:54,639 --> 00:50:57,993
from correctional. He's PO Mr, Forest
said he's lived in a half way house in, queens.

782
00:50:57,994 --> 00:51:01,689
he's not a scoundral, mediocre 
appearances he's piss has been clean...

783
00:51:01,738 --> 00:51:04,646
But he was a no show at work 
today, he didn't call in. Nothing.

784
00:51:04,647 --> 00:51:06,471
He knows the system,

785
00:51:06,472 --> 00:51:09,064
perfect place in the 
subway to stop the train.

786
00:51:09,065 --> 00:51:11,515
He's only been out a month. This 
wasn't planned in the last three weeks.

787
00:51:11,516 --> 00:51:14,798
Find out who, Ramos' cell-mates were, 
who worked in the laundry with him.

788
00:51:14,799 --> 00:51:17,103
Call list, visitor's list, ASAP.

789
00:51:17,104 --> 00:51:19,113


790
00:51:48,777 --> 00:51:51,081


791
00:51:51,082 --> 00:51:56,285
<i>The market has tumbled nearly 7%, 
as the investors continue to react to the events...</i>

792
00:51:56,401 --> 00:51:56,974
They just came of the bridge.

793
00:51:57,099 --> 00:51:59,289
Why didn't we send a 
helicopter for the money?

794
00:52:01,545 --> 00:52:04,329
Walter, now remember what I said 
about talking through deadlines, right?

795
00:52:04,330 --> 00:52:07,977
We gotta have a plan B in case 
the money isn't here on the dot.

796
00:52:07,978 --> 00:52:11,946
Put him back on he's heels. He knows 
things, we know things too, right?

797
00:52:12,027 --> 00:52:13,545
- Right.
- Ask him about, Phil Ramos.

798
00:52:14,122 --> 00:52:16,329
Just get him talking. 
You can do it.

799
00:52:20,170 --> 00:52:21,321
Hey, Ryder?

800
00:52:21,322 --> 00:52:23,250
- The money here yet?
- On the way.

801
00:52:23,350 --> 00:52:24,970
So what the fuck, you calling me for?

802
00:52:25,259 --> 00:52:27,475
Actually, I just called to talk.

803
00:52:28,425 --> 00:52:30,536
Oh yeah? What do 
you want to talk about?

804
00:52:31,017 --> 00:52:32,840
You said that a...

805
00:52:32,841 --> 00:52:37,160
being in the motormans cab that 
was like being in a confessional, right?

806
00:52:37,161 --> 00:52:38,217
Yeah.

807
00:52:38,218 --> 00:52:41,002
I was thinking, maybe it's a little 
like being in a prison cell too.

808
00:52:41,003 --> 00:52:44,216
What you trying to say? That If I 
get caught, I better get used to it?

809
00:52:44,217 --> 00:52:45,657
No, I'm just wondering...

810
00:52:45,658 --> 00:52:47,394
maybe your already used to it...

811
00:52:47,495 --> 00:52:48,635
I'm wondering maybe...

812
00:52:48,636 --> 00:52:51,656
That's how you meet a 
guy like, Phil Ramos.

813
00:52:51,657 --> 00:52:53,681
How the fuck does he know that!

814
00:52:53,682 --> 00:52:55,114
Why don't you tell me, Garber? Then, 

815
00:52:55,115 --> 00:52:57,323
we'll both know. After today's confession,

816
00:52:57,324 --> 00:52:59,244
your going to find 
your ass in prison too.!

817
00:52:59,245 --> 00:53:00,493
Which is my point.

818
00:53:00,494 --> 00:53:02,030
I want you to hook 
me up on the inside,

819
00:53:02,127 --> 00:53:05,451
I know you know everybody, this way 
when I come up with my own heist plan,

820
00:53:05,452 --> 00:53:07,084
you know I'll cut you in.

821
00:53:07,181 --> 00:53:09,869
I can see I've inspired you. 
Okay I've got a story for you.

822
00:53:10,063 --> 00:53:12,392
It might help you in prison. you
Wanna hear it? We got a minute?

823
00:53:12,393 --> 00:53:14,313
Yeah, I'd like to hear a little story.

824
00:53:14,314 --> 00:53:17,192
Alrighty so back in the day, 
when I was a high roller.

825
00:53:17,193 --> 00:53:19,017
When were you ever a high roller?

826
00:53:19,018 --> 00:53:22,280
Well you know, I told you I fed the 
city breakfast every morning.

827
00:53:22,281 --> 00:53:25,005
- Bacon and eggs?
- Or something like that.

828
00:53:25,306 --> 00:53:27,605
Well anyway back in the day, 
I took this chick to, Iceland.

829
00:53:25,259 --> 00:53:27,467


830
00:53:27,948 --> 00:53:30,540
Iceland? Is that where 
all the high rollers go?

831
00:53:30,541 --> 00:53:32,365
Iceland is 6 hours from, Canada.

832
00:53:32,366 --> 00:53:36,584
The night-club scene is intense, and
I thought I'd take this chick to iceland.

833
00:53:36,585 --> 00:53:39,657
- What's her name?
- Lavicta, she was, Lithuanian.

834
00:53:39,658 --> 00:53:42,274
She was an ass model.

835
00:53:42,359 --> 00:53:43,400
She asked what?

836
00:53:43,593 --> 00:53:46,281
You heard of hand models, 
right, for advertisements.

837
00:53:46,378 --> 00:53:50,792
She was an ass model.
She did jeans and magazines and shit.

838
00:53:51,081 --> 00:53:54,152
Anyway, it was a fashion 
week in new york and a...

839
00:53:54,153 --> 00:53:55,401
I took her to, Iceland.

840
00:53:55,690 --> 00:53:59,914
Lavicta, Lithuania, ass model,
Iceland. You took her to the ice.

841
00:53:59,915 --> 00:54:03,473
For $500, they take you on a 
dogs-sledge ride in the glaciers.

842
00:54:03,570 --> 00:54:05,349
- Dogs sleigh?
- Yeah.

843
00:54:05,437 --> 00:54:09,080
And you know the whole saying, if your 
not the lead dog, the view never changes?

844
00:54:09,081 --> 00:54:13,689
Right, otherwise your always looking 
at the asshole of the dog in front of you.

845
00:54:13,786 --> 00:54:15,560
That would be funny 
if I get to that part.

846
00:54:15,657 --> 00:54:17,961
It's funny now.

847
00:54:33,223 --> 00:54:35,623
And it's 8 in the morning and 
we haven't been to bed yet.

848
00:54:35,720 --> 00:54:40,215
And it was 2 when we crossed 
this glacier and I got this hangover 

849
00:54:40,688 --> 00:54:43,304
that's creeping up the back of my neck... 
and guess what I'm looking at?

850
00:54:43,305 --> 00:54:47,581
Your obviously, you're staring at the ass
of the dog in front of you.

851
00:54:47,782 --> 00:54:48,934
You got it!

852
00:54:49,035 --> 00:54:49,259


853
00:54:49,356 --> 00:54:52,903
so this dog, out of know where just lifts it's 
hind legs up and puts them in the harness

854
00:54:52,904 --> 00:54:55,976
and just takes a shit, whilst it's 
running on it's front paw.

855
00:54:56,073 --> 00:54:58,682
so he's dumping and running, 
all at the same time

856
00:54:58,683 --> 00:55:00,929
now that's multi fucking 
tasking if you ask me.

857
00:55:00,930 --> 00:55:03,162
Get outta here. Did it hit you?

858
00:55:03,463 --> 00:55:05,099
Shit always hit's you, man!

859
00:55:16,676 --> 00:55:19,303
I didn't know at the time, 
but it was profound!

860
00:55:19,304 --> 00:55:21,552
- Profound?
- Yeah.

861
00:55:21,953 --> 00:55:22,605
You lost me.

862
00:55:22,706 --> 00:55:25,354
You know, when I went to 
prison, later on, which you called.

863
00:55:25,355 --> 00:55:29,633
I had trouble going to the 
toilet, you know... privacy thing.

864
00:55:30,306 --> 00:55:31,746
and I...

865
00:55:31,939 --> 00:55:35,099
I couldn't take a shit,
I was scared shitless, literally.

866
00:55:35,779 --> 00:55:38,983
- So, you know what I thought of?
- You thought of the dog!

867
00:55:39,080 --> 00:55:41,288
That's right. I thought if that dog.

868
00:55:41,289 --> 00:55:44,169
could do what it needed 
to do, so could I.

869
00:55:44,266 --> 00:55:46,090
Saved my fucking life!

870
00:55:46,667 --> 00:55:48,487
Wow, that is profound.

871
00:55:50,216 --> 00:55:52,424
And you know it's... it's...

872
00:55:52,809 --> 00:55:53,930
People adapt

873
00:55:54,027 --> 00:55:55,275
It's like you and I,

874
00:55:55,372 --> 00:55:57,388
like today, we didn't know 
how today was going to start.

875
00:55:57,389 --> 00:55:59,021
- Wrong!
- Wrong what?

876
00:55:59,022 --> 00:56:00,750
I knew exactly how it was going to start.

877
00:56:00,847 --> 00:56:03,055
Yeah but, do you know 
how it's going to end?

878
00:56:04,592 --> 00:56:06,650
I'm tired of talking you, Garber.

879
00:56:06,747 --> 00:56:08,859
- No wait...
- Call me when the money comes in.

880
00:56:08,860 --> 00:56:10,300
You got 4 minutes.

881
00:56:12,221 --> 00:56:15,011
I don't know what he looks 
like, but he sounds good.

882
00:56:15,212 --> 00:56:17,000
Fucking talk's shit?

883
00:56:17,289 --> 00:56:19,418
He's got a sexy voice, man
he can be my bitch in prison.

884
00:56:19,803 --> 00:56:23,335
- Where are we?
- Less than 10 blocks away.

885
00:56:55,206 --> 00:56:57,654
Shit. Captain, the money 
car crashed on first avenue.

886
00:56:57,847 --> 00:57:00,966
Get a radio car, put in on a 
motorcycle and get it there.

887
00:57:30,151 --> 00:57:32,627
You got 22 seconds, Garber.

888
00:57:32,820 --> 00:57:37,908
- Alright, we just had a little problem over here, that's all...
- I don't care!

889
00:57:43,669 --> 00:57:45,685
Two minutes.

890
00:57:45,686 --> 00:57:47,929
- Tell him it's here, how the hell's he gonna know?
- I don't think I should lie.

891
00:57:48,026 --> 00:57:50,330
Tell him the truth

892
00:57:50,427 --> 00:57:52,059
Tell him the truth?

893
00:57:52,444 --> 00:57:54,342
He's going to make me do it.

894
00:58:03,942 --> 00:58:05,094
10...

895
00:58:05,287 --> 00:58:06,439
9...

896
00:58:06,440 --> 00:58:08,552
- 8...
- Tell him the truth, or lie!

897
00:58:08,553 --> 00:58:10,761
- Tell him the truth!
- No! tell him it's here.

898
00:58:10,762 --> 00:58:12,490
- 4... 3...
- Tell him it's here!

899
00:58:12,491 --> 00:58:13,931
- It's here!
- Two... One!

900
00:58:13,932 --> 00:58:17,196
The money is there, it's 
at 42nd and vendervilled.

901
00:58:19,686 --> 00:58:22,086
Liar! Mother fucking, liar!

902
00:58:22,471 --> 00:58:24,198
Seven!

903
00:58:24,679 --> 00:58:25,735
Um ..

904
00:58:25,735 --> 00:58:28,423
- Ryder?
- 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.

905
00:58:28,424 --> 00:58:32,360
- Get the lady up, come on up, up!
- I think that's him.

906
00:58:32,361 --> 00:58:37,061
Ryder, listen to me! We 
made a mistake, it's my fault!

907
00:58:37,062 --> 00:58:40,133
- The cars hit, that's why the...
- Tell him something.

908
00:58:43,014 --> 00:58:44,549
- Up, up!
- Get up!

909
00:58:44,550 --> 00:58:46,470
Get back in line!

910
00:58:46,471 --> 00:58:48,967
Ryder, one minute it's going to take.

911
00:58:52,997 --> 00:58:56,073
Don't do this, for God's sake!
It was an accident!

912
00:58:56,070 --> 00:58:58,565
- Wait!
- It's the only plan I've got!

913
00:58:58,566 --> 00:58:59,910
Ryder, listen!

914
00:58:59,911 --> 00:59:01,831
It was an accident!
It was an accident, Ryder!

915
00:59:01,832 --> 00:59:02,984
We made a mistake.

916
00:59:03,081 --> 00:59:05,001
It was an accident, Ryder!

917
00:59:05,290 --> 00:59:07,493
Come on, mother fucker!

918
00:59:10,469 --> 00:59:11,813
God!

919
00:59:19,877 --> 00:59:23,045
ESU, Team 1, to sniper 1:
Do you have a shot?

920
00:59:23,142 --> 00:59:24,774
That's your fault!

921
00:59:30,919 --> 00:59:33,808
Got an easy shot, please advise.

922
00:59:33,865 --> 00:59:36,015
- Stand by.
- Roger that.

923
01:00:04,421 --> 01:00:06,341
What the fuck happened?

924
01:00:07,014 --> 01:00:08,549
Accidental discharge.

925
01:00:08,550 --> 01:00:10,182
Just got bit by a fucking, rat!

926
01:00:10,183 --> 01:00:11,815
It's accidental discharge.

927
01:00:11,816 --> 01:00:14,120
Who, who go shot?
Was it, Ryder?

928
01:00:14,120 --> 01:00:15,752
No, it was, Ramos.

929
01:00:24,005 --> 01:00:27,365
- Sergeant, the money there yet?
- Yes, yes.

930
01:00:28,709 --> 01:00:29,861
Ryder, are you there?

931
01:00:29,862 --> 01:00:31,878
Shoot any mother fucker that moves!

932
01:00:32,743 --> 01:00:34,951
- It's an order!
- Shove your orders!

933
01:00:35,048 --> 01:00:36,296
Can you hear me, Ryder?

934
01:00:36,297 --> 01:00:38,889
Okay, now somebody else has to die!

935
01:00:39,370 --> 01:00:42,290
Two people, maybe all of us!

936
01:00:45,028 --> 01:00:46,180
Did you hear me?

937
01:00:46,181 --> 01:00:47,717
I heard you, but you got to understand.

938
01:00:47,718 --> 01:00:50,404
The circumstances, they're 
different now for you.

939
01:00:50,405 --> 01:00:52,613
You gotta re-think this, you gotta adapt.

940
01:00:52,614 --> 01:00:55,780
No, I gave instructions and 
you know the consequences!

941
01:00:55,781 --> 01:00:57,605
Don't you have a plan, B?

942
01:00:57,606 --> 01:00:59,622
No! The plan "B" was 
enforcing plan "A"!

943
01:00:59,623 --> 01:01:02,212
The minute you stop believing 
me, mother fucker!

944
01:01:02,213 --> 01:01:04,229
- That's it!
- I believe you, but...

945
01:01:04,230 --> 01:01:07,974
you gotta believe, and understand that those cops are 
gonna be down that tunnel and next to you any second...

946
01:01:07,975 --> 01:01:10,759
Bring it, man! Let them 
come, I don't care!

947
01:01:10,760 --> 01:01:12,680
What's the point of that, 
huh? What's the point of that.

948
01:01:12,681 --> 01:01:15,268
I told you, we all owe god a death.

949
01:01:15,269 --> 01:01:17,765
and now it's 2 minutes past the deadline.

950
01:01:17,766 --> 01:01:21,318
2 minutes! which means 2 people almost 3,

951
01:01:21,415 --> 01:01:23,239
have to go. They have to die.

952
01:01:25,156 --> 01:01:28,420
The money's there, Ryder. 
Nobody else has to die.

953
01:01:28,521 --> 01:01:32,452
I don't know what you owe god, but 
I can tell you, you can't pay him in cash.

954
01:01:34,661 --> 01:01:38,885
You never see a U horn behind a 
hearse, Ryder the, Egyptians tried it,

955
01:01:38,886 --> 01:01:40,806
it doesn't work, you can't 
take the money with you.

956
01:01:42,055 --> 01:01:43,300
Ryder?

957
01:01:44,549 --> 01:01:45,988
You can't take the money with you!

958
01:01:46,373 --> 01:01:48,485
All this talk of, god...

959
01:01:49,062 --> 01:01:51,462
I think I need to pray. 
Give me a minute.

960
01:01:55,108 --> 01:01:56,644
I can do that.

961
01:02:02,116 --> 01:02:03,844
You did good, Walter.

962
01:02:07,301 --> 01:02:09,701
What's the reality of getting 
in there and ending this?

963
01:02:09,702 --> 01:02:13,636
We have to except heavy casualties 
on all sides, it's a hard choice.

964
01:02:13,637 --> 01:02:17,477
- but I say make it!
- New york city, does not have an acceptable casualty rate.

965
01:02:17,958 --> 01:02:19,974
Now this is your area of expertise, 

966
01:02:19,974 --> 01:02:21,222
- what do you suggest?
- I think we should by time.

967
01:02:21,223 --> 01:02:23,623
so far the son-of-a-bitch 
hasn't allowed us to do

968
01:02:23,720 --> 01:02:25,736
that, but this might be the first 
time we got through to him.

969
01:02:25,737 --> 01:02:28,329
Chester man here, just confessed 
to a felony, 20 minutes ago.

970
01:02:28,434 --> 01:02:31,492
In my opinion, there are people down 
there who are alive because of him.

971
01:02:31,492 --> 01:02:33,700
Until we change the 
rules or hope runs out, 

972
01:02:33,701 --> 01:02:35,621
we should stick with the 
situation we have now.

973
01:02:37,254 --> 01:02:38,979
Do what you need to do.

974
01:02:49,828 --> 01:02:51,459
Hey, Garber,. You there?

975
01:02:51,844 --> 01:02:53,860
- Yeah, I'm here.
- Speak up.

976
01:02:53,861 --> 01:02:55,109
I'm here.

977
01:02:56,646 --> 01:02:59,430
- I talked to, god.
- That's good! What did he say.

978
01:02:59,527 --> 01:03:00,871
He said I should trust in him

979
01:03:00,888 --> 01:03:04,040
all others pay cash, how soon 
can you get it down here.

980
01:03:05,673 --> 01:03:09,129
From the next station, it would take 
them about 5 minutes to walk it down.

981
01:03:09,226 --> 01:03:10,666
10 minutes to walk it down.

982
01:03:10,763 --> 01:03:12,587
No, no, no! I mean you, man.

983
01:03:12,684 --> 01:03:14,988
How long would it take you, 
to come down here?

984
01:03:15,373 --> 01:03:17,197
I don't understand.
What do you mean, me?

985
01:03:17,294 --> 01:03:19,214
I mean "you". I want to 
meet you, Garber.

986
01:03:19,215 --> 01:03:22,191
If you bring it, I know the 
cops aren't bringing it.

987
01:03:22,960 --> 01:03:24,387
Well, you know...

988
01:03:24,388 --> 01:03:27,364
I don't know how I'm going to carry 
that money, I mean it must weigh.

989
01:03:27,365 --> 01:03:30,245
220 pounds, stick it in a 
fucking wheel barrow or something.

990
01:03:30,250 --> 01:03:33,798
Why we discussing weight? Shouldn't 
you be thinking get the fuck outta there?

991
01:03:33,799 --> 01:03:36,775
- Okay, get the fuck outta there!
- Good! That's progress!

992
01:03:36,776 --> 01:03:38,984
Now look, plan B, your idea...

993
01:03:39,081 --> 01:03:41,961
and part of plan, B is you,
Garber, deliver that money!

994
01:03:41,962 --> 01:03:44,170
Or I kill another hostage, you got that?

995
01:03:47,531 --> 01:03:50,115
You got seven minutes, buddy boy.

996
01:03:57,219 --> 01:04:01,059
You got 6 minutes and
55 seconds, check me.

997
01:04:02,883 --> 01:04:04,324
Do it!

998
01:04:05,382 --> 01:04:08,550
- Check.
- And tell that sleeze bag negotiator

999
01:04:08,647 --> 01:04:10,663
to call me when you got the money.

1000
01:04:14,019 --> 01:04:15,857
You don't have to do this.

1001
01:04:40,322 --> 01:04:43,202
Finally somebody got 
their head out of their ass.

1002
01:04:48,194 --> 01:04:49,346
Hello?

1003
01:04:49,347 --> 01:04:51,506
Hey, how you doing baby?
What are you doing?

1004
01:04:52,179 --> 01:04:55,874
What do you mean, what am I doing? 
I'm watching the thing. The hostages.

1005
01:04:55,875 --> 01:04:59,426
They mentioned you I think, they said 
a dispatcher was talking to the terrorist.

1006
01:04:59,427 --> 01:05:01,347
Yeah, yeah. They are not terrorists.

1007
01:05:01,540 --> 01:05:04,228
They are. If they're down 
there waving guns at people.

1008
01:05:04,229 --> 01:05:05,861
Right, right listen. You listening?

1009
01:05:05,862 --> 01:05:07,110
I'm listening.

1010
01:05:07,207 --> 01:05:12,679
Look, I'm the one that... your right 
I was the one that was talking to them.

1011
01:05:12,680 --> 01:05:16,040
I knew it! I am so proud of you!

1012
01:05:16,041 --> 01:05:18,921
After everything, all this. Them trying to fire you

1013
01:05:18,922 --> 01:05:21,706
- But...
- and you...

1014
01:05:21,803 --> 01:05:22,859
Where are you?

1015
01:05:22,956 --> 01:05:25,101
I'm at a, a... heliport.

1016
01:05:25,390 --> 01:05:31,548
I'm getting ready to get on the helicopter, they 
want me to take the money down to the tunnel.

1017
01:05:31,933 --> 01:05:32,989
What?

1018
01:05:32,990 --> 01:05:34,718
Are they crazy?

1019
01:05:34,718 --> 01:05:37,502
It's real simple, there's nothing to it.

1020
01:05:37,503 --> 01:05:40,226
What it is, is he know's 
I'm not a cop so he

1021
01:05:40,227 --> 01:05:42,339
wants me to come down... 
Is it okay if I wait here?

1022
01:05:42,532 --> 01:05:43,588
Can I wait here?

1023
01:05:43,589 --> 01:05:46,754
They need me to take the money down 
there because they know I'm not a cop.

1024
01:05:46,755 --> 01:05:48,195
and a...

1025
01:05:48,292 --> 01:05:50,500
You know, they saying 
they might kill somebody.

1026
01:05:50,501 --> 01:05:52,229
Well then somebody has to die.

1027
01:05:52,326 --> 01:05:53,862
Because you can't.

1028
01:05:53,863 --> 01:05:55,015
Let it out!

1029
01:05:55,016 --> 01:05:57,608
I understand, baby!
Listen to me! Listen to me

1030
01:05:57,609 --> 01:05:59,234
Just tell, Angela to meet... 


1031
01:05:59,241 --> 01:06:02,889
when she runs over the hurdle, tell her 
to run straight to the hurdle tomorrow

1032
01:06:02,890 --> 01:06:06,094
Just like I always tell 
her, okay? I gotta go.

1033
01:06:06,731 --> 01:06:08,834
You tell her, yourself!

1034
01:06:08,835 --> 01:06:11,427
- Now, you listen to me.
- Yeah, I'm listening.

1035
01:06:11,428 --> 01:06:14,404
You do what you have 
to do, but we need milk.

1036
01:06:14,405 --> 01:06:17,093
so on your way home,
I want you to bring a gallon.

1037
01:06:17,093 --> 01:06:18,545
Milk, okay?

1038
01:06:19,652 --> 01:06:20,646
You promise!

1039
01:06:20,647 --> 01:06:23,239
Why a gallon? why not half a gallon?

1040
01:06:23,240 --> 01:06:24,584
Just bring a gallon.

1041
01:06:24,873 --> 01:06:26,313
A gallon.

1042
01:06:28,426 --> 01:06:30,875
Okay, I can get a half a gallon.

1043
01:06:32,028 --> 01:06:33,468
I gotta go.

1044
01:06:36,925 --> 01:06:38,365
Alright, we can go.

1045
01:06:53,761 --> 01:06:55,681
Put your headset on.

1046
01:07:07,009 --> 01:07:09,121
You ever do anything like this before?

1047
01:07:09,122 --> 01:07:11,138
You know, go in unarmed?

1048
01:07:11,139 --> 01:07:14,545
Yes, 2 years ago.
Brooklyn. A robbery.

1049
01:07:14,930 --> 01:07:16,609
I got the hostages out.

1050
01:07:19,490 --> 01:07:21,275
And the guy, with the gun?

1051
01:07:21,276 --> 01:07:23,964
The guy with the gun, 
didn't have a role for him.

1052
01:07:25,441 --> 01:07:27,169
With the guy with the gun.

1053
01:07:33,217 --> 01:07:35,618
It's nice seeing it from this perspective, huh?

1054
01:07:37,155 --> 01:07:39,073
You can see what your fighting for.

1055
01:07:53,857 --> 01:07:54,932
I love you so much!

1056
01:07:58,869 --> 01:08:00,385
Did you hear me?

1057
01:08:00,577 --> 01:08:02,017
Yeah.

1058
01:08:06,337 --> 01:08:08,074
Would you love me back?

1059
01:08:09,515 --> 01:08:11,147
I can't really talk right now.

1060
01:08:16,513 --> 01:08:18,145
All you have to say is, "yes."

1061
01:08:18,818 --> 01:08:21,505
It's alot less than saying, I can't talk.

1062
01:08:26,018 --> 01:08:28,514
I'm having a really 
fucking weird day.

1063
01:08:32,257 --> 01:08:33,697
Oh, God!

1064
01:08:33,793 --> 01:08:36,961
We'd anticipated this, we could 
have made alot of money.

1065
01:08:41,568 --> 01:08:44,381
What kind of guy would you 
expect to take a model to, Iceland...

1066
01:08:44,478 --> 01:08:46,206
- for the weekend?
- An ass, model.

1067
01:08:46,494 --> 01:08:48,126
An ass model.

1068
01:08:48,607 --> 01:08:51,007
- A wall street, guy.
- A wall street, guy.

1069
01:09:00,096 --> 01:09:02,170
<i>1 hour time limit reported 
earlier has expired...</i>

1070
01:09:02,171 --> 01:09:05,434
<i>We're not sure who this is entering, 
it could be hostage negotiator or</i>


1071
01:09:05,435 --> 01:09:06,971
<i>a ploice detective.</i>

1072
01:09:06,972 --> 01:09:09,504
<i>When we have any 
updates, we'll be back live</i>


1073
01:09:17,376 --> 01:09:19,104
- Mr. Garber?
- Lieutenant, Sterman.

1074
01:09:19,201 --> 01:09:20,257
Pleasure.

1075
01:09:20,258 --> 01:09:21,314
The radio set up to the train?

1076
01:09:21,315 --> 01:09:25,056
It's set up back there, you can talk 
directly to the train or to rail control.

1077
01:09:25,057 --> 01:09:27,936
Just do everything he say's and 
remember everything you see.

1078
01:09:28,417 --> 01:09:29,857
Let's go.

1079
01:09:31,778 --> 01:09:33,936
Who the hell did you 
fuck, to get this job?

1080
01:09:33,937 --> 01:09:35,185
Myself.

1081
01:09:35,186 --> 01:09:36,864
- It was easier than it looks.
- Yeah?

1082
01:09:36,961 --> 01:09:38,881
Fucking yourself always is.

1083
01:09:42,337 --> 01:09:45,754
Pelham 1-2-3, come in.
Pelham 1-2-3, come in.

1084
01:09:45,754 --> 01:09:50,016
- Who am I talking to?
- This is Lieutenant, Camonetti. We spoke earlier.

1085
01:09:50,017 --> 01:09:53,299
Yeah, your the grease ball, what 
did you do go out for a pizza?

1086
01:09:53,492 --> 01:09:55,905
Where's my money. Where is it?

1087
01:09:55,906 --> 01:09:59,040
Mr Garber is in the tunnel.
the money is 2 minutes away.

1088
01:09:59,041 --> 01:10:03,053
Mr Garber is a dependable, man. 
He's a good man too.

1089
01:10:03,054 --> 01:10:05,166
Absolutely. How about you, Ryder?

1090
01:10:05,166 --> 01:10:07,278
everybody’s got some good 
in them, don't you think?

1091
01:10:07,279 --> 01:10:10,848
Is this the part where you try to get through 
to me? I don't think so mother fucker!

1092
01:10:10,849 --> 01:10:12,691
I got 3 instructions for you:

1093
01:10:12,692 --> 01:10:17,664
Number 1: When this conversation is over, I 
want you to restore the power to the hull sector.

1094
01:10:17,665 --> 01:10:18,817
Number 2:

1095
01:10:18,818 --> 01:10:22,656
I want you to clear the local track's from 
68th street down to, coney island.

1096
01:10:22,657 --> 01:10:25,441
and when I say clear, 
I don't wanna see no cops.

1097
01:10:25,442 --> 01:10:28,800
I want all the lights green and don't trip 
me up with a red one, you got that?

1098
01:10:28,801 --> 01:10:30,145
Absolutely.

1099
01:10:30,145 --> 01:10:31,585
And number 3:

1100
01:10:31,586 --> 01:10:36,297
Don't play games with me, or I'll track you down 
and fuck you and your grease-ball ass, mother fucker!

1101
01:10:38,794 --> 01:10:40,607
Over and out!

1102
01:10:51,071 --> 01:10:53,471
- You know how to use one of these?
- No.

1103
01:10:53,472 --> 01:10:58,683
It's real simple, okay. 
Safety's on. safety's off. On,off.

1104
01:10:58,752 --> 01:11:01,632
You just aim at anything you don't like 
and you pull the trigger, got that?

1105
01:11:01,633 --> 01:11:02,785
What if they frisk me?

1106
01:11:02,786 --> 01:11:04,418
We got that covered.

1107
01:11:06,339 --> 01:11:07,583
That's it?

1108
01:11:07,776 --> 01:11:09,312
That's it.

1109
01:11:09,985 --> 01:11:12,289
It's got a false bottom, 
just gotta do this.

1110
01:11:14,018 --> 01:11:15,266
- You got that?
- Got it.

1111
01:11:15,267 --> 01:11:16,515
Good.

1112
01:11:16,804 --> 01:11:18,335
Don't worry about it.

1113
01:11:19,487 --> 01:11:21,312
Just don't fuck it up.

1114
01:11:27,551 --> 01:11:29,375
We got an, ID on, Ryder.

1115
01:11:30,240 --> 01:11:33,504
Dennis Ford. He was released 
from, corrections 2 weeks ago.

1116
01:11:33,505 --> 01:11:37,633
Did a 9 year stretch, the last 4 in 
the same cell block as, Phil Ramos.

1117
01:11:38,498 --> 01:11:42,143
He's name shows up on an, Icelandic
air passengers list in, september of 1998

1118
01:11:42,144 --> 01:11:43,968
right after fashion week.

1119
01:11:43,969 --> 01:11:46,081
Dennis Ford! You remember?

1120
01:11:46,082 --> 01:11:48,386
We used he's case when he 
was running as an example...

1121
01:11:48,387 --> 01:11:52,323
The kind of nonsense we would clean 
up, if I ever get elected, mayor, yeah..

1122
01:11:52,326 --> 01:11:53,668
He ran a private equity firm...

1123
01:11:53,681 --> 01:11:55,781
he's biggest client was 
the city pension fund,

1124
01:11:55,782 --> 01:11:56,262
Sifendorff.

1125
01:11:56,454 --> 01:12:00,486
20 million dollars, he did a plea 
bargain for 3, judge gave him 10.

1126
01:12:00,486 --> 01:12:02,502
Maybe that's why he's so pissed off!

1127
01:12:02,695 --> 01:12:06,623
The judge gave him 10 years because 
we didn't recover all of the city's money.

1128
01:12:06,624 --> 01:12:08,544
There was a couple of million 
unaccounted for, it was the siege money.

1129
01:12:08,545 --> 01:12:09,697
- Siege money? For what?

1130
01:12:09,698 --> 01:12:11,810
For today. He played the terrorist card.

1131
01:12:11,811 --> 01:12:13,539
You panic the market into a drop.

1132
01:12:13,539 --> 01:12:16,899
If you know what's coming, you can make 
a great deal of money with 2 million dollars.

1133
01:12:16,900 --> 01:12:18,240
What about the hostage money?

1134
01:12:18,241 --> 01:12:20,357
Are you kidding, that's nothing compared 
to the money you can make in the market.

1135
01:12:20,358 --> 01:12:24,959
Let's get down town, get to 
the, SCC. Check the trades.

1136
01:12:47,519 --> 01:12:51,359
We got company.

1137
01:13:03,552 --> 01:13:04,992
Garber!

1138
01:13:05,185 --> 01:13:09,217
When you put your socks on 
this morning, did you ever think...

1139
01:13:10,178 --> 01:13:13,250
Turn around, let him frisk you?

1140
01:13:15,459 --> 01:13:16,899
I was worried about you...

1141
01:13:17,284 --> 01:13:19,972
I thought maybe you'll get lost, then I 
remembered, you were a motorman so...

1142
01:13:19,973 --> 01:13:22,717
These tunnels don't 
change much, do they?

1143
01:13:21,318 --> 01:13:23,142


1144
01:13:23,719 --> 01:13:26,119
Just the people in them.

1145
01:13:28,136 --> 01:13:29,384
We good?

1146
01:13:29,385 --> 01:13:32,361
- Looks, good.
- Alright, come on up!

1147
01:13:32,746 --> 01:13:34,666
Let's go!

1148
01:13:54,442 --> 01:13:57,322
Damn, your taller than 
I thought you'd be.

1149
01:13:57,515 --> 01:14:00,107
Your good looking too, 
come on. Sit down.

1150
01:14:00,588 --> 01:14:02,604
It's nice to meet you.

1151
01:14:15,373 --> 01:14:17,773
What do you weigh, about, 220?

1152
01:14:17,774 --> 01:14:22,286
Err...Yeah, I'm a, 220 on a good day.

1153
01:14:23,631 --> 01:14:26,031
Ah, that's, Ramos.

1154
01:14:26,416 --> 01:14:30,064
He's what you would have called, 
the "brains of the operation."

1155
01:14:31,217 --> 01:14:34,865
Dumb fuck.

1156
01:14:36,690 --> 01:14:40,626
So how long has it been, since 
you've driven one of these?

1157
01:14:43,603 --> 01:14:45,235
That's why you, brought me down here?

1158
01:14:45,236 --> 01:14:47,252
Well your a motorman, 
right? once a motorman

1159
01:14:47,252 --> 01:14:49,172
always a motarman..

1160
01:14:49,173 --> 01:14:52,821
Play your cards right, you 
might get part of the cut.

1161
01:14:59,254 --> 01:15:02,518
What the fuck?

1162
01:15:05,303 --> 01:15:09,815
This is a... new train, I'm not 
certified on a new train.

1163
01:15:09,816 --> 01:15:11,448
But I've got "faith" in you, man.

1164
01:15:11,449 --> 01:15:13,081
Let me ask you one question.

1165
01:15:13,082 --> 01:15:16,058
You know, that saying, when you 
told your wife about the 35k...

1166
01:15:16,059 --> 01:15:17,595
how did she react?

1167
01:15:17,884 --> 01:15:20,380
- Look, we gotta talk about it?
- Don't be sensitive.

1168
01:15:20,381 --> 01:15:21,917
- I'm not being sensitive?
- Did she freak out or what?

1169
01:15:22,014 --> 01:15:24,990
She wasn't happy,
but she understood.

1170
01:15:24,991 --> 01:15:26,911
- Well that's love, right?
- No, that's marriage...

1171
01:15:26,912 --> 01:15:28,544
that's another thing.

1172
01:15:28,737 --> 01:15:30,753
So what's the deal? you think 
they're going to move the train?

1173
01:15:30,850 --> 01:15:32,674
Seems like a possibility... 
How we covered

1174
01:15:32,962 --> 01:15:34,690
with street level exits 
and emergency exits?

1175
01:15:34,691 --> 01:15:35,747
I got a blanket on the fuckers!

1176
01:15:35,748 --> 01:15:38,148
I got radios cars, manned on every exit...

1177
01:15:38,437 --> 01:15:39,685
from 42nd to, south ferry.

1178
01:15:39,782 --> 01:15:40,838
We got to go.

1179
01:15:41,223 --> 01:15:43,431
Hey, Camonetti!

1180
01:15:43,624 --> 01:15:45,736
Fucking grease ball, man.

1181
01:15:45,737 --> 01:15:47,561
Hey, grease ball, speak up!

1182
01:15:47,946 --> 01:15:50,058
I see red, I don't see green.

1183
01:15:50,347 --> 01:15:52,171
What's taking so fucking long?

1184
01:15:52,172 --> 01:15:56,300
The blanket is not tucked in yet. You have 
to stall, I need 2 minutes, buy me two minutes.

1185
01:15:56,301 --> 01:15:57,933
They haven't cleared the tracks yet.

1186
01:15:57,934 --> 01:16:00,718
Mr. Ryder will be up and 
ready in less than two minutes.

1187
01:16:00,719 --> 01:16:03,791
Okay, we're going to 
move forward here, okay!

1188
01:16:03,792 --> 01:16:06,672
we're going to move forward 
and if we get on to a red signal...

1189
01:16:06,673 --> 01:16:08,113
and the brakes trip up,

1190
01:16:08,114 --> 01:16:10,802
your friend, Walter Garber's
getting it in the head...

1191
01:16:12,722 --> 01:16:14,834
- You got it?
- Yes sir, I got it.

1192
01:16:14,835 --> 01:16:17,427
Let's roll, let's roll.

1193
01:16:17,620 --> 01:16:20,404
- You are bluffing.
- Yeah, I'm bluffing, man.

1194
01:16:20,501 --> 01:16:23,093
You got to say what you got to say.

1195
01:16:23,766 --> 01:16:27,414
You thought by coming down here, 
you'd be redeemed didn't you?

1196
01:16:27,415 --> 01:16:29,815
God bless, Garber.

1197
01:16:30,200 --> 01:16:32,600
You're more fucked up than I am.

1198
01:16:32,889 --> 01:16:35,193
The least the same fucked up.

1199
01:16:35,578 --> 01:16:37,690
Come on. Let's go
Let's go, let's go...

1200
01:16:42,875 --> 01:16:45,179
Let's go!

1201
01:16:53,820 --> 01:16:57,660
She's on the move.

1202
01:16:59,197 --> 01:17:01,885
Put some speed on it.

1203
01:17:07,358 --> 01:17:11,102


1204
01:17:17,918 --> 01:17:21,278
You're playing with fire, my man.
I want to see them green.

1205
01:17:21,279 --> 01:17:24,831
Change them to green or I'll put a hole 
in, Garber's head right now. Do it!

1206
01:17:24,832 --> 01:17:27,712
Believe me, we are 
moving as fast as we can.

1207
01:17:27,713 --> 01:17:29,249
What happens if they run a red light?

1208
01:17:29,250 --> 01:17:31,362
It will trip the brakes.

1209
01:17:31,459 --> 01:17:33,571
Coming up on the first one.

1210
01:17:35,492 --> 01:17:39,236
Yeah! That's what I'm looking for.
That's what I'm looking for.

1211
01:17:39,333 --> 01:17:43,653
Here he comes right now.

1212
01:17:52,966 --> 01:17:55,942
Your man, Garber is driving the 
train. The sniper confirmed.

1213
01:17:55,943 --> 01:17:58,535
So what are you saying, he's 
in on it! There is no fucking way.

1214
01:17:58,536 --> 01:18:01,224
The sniper killed, Ramos 
he was their driver... so

1215
01:18:01,225 --> 01:18:03,625
they probably need, Garber to drive.

1216
01:18:09,866 --> 01:18:11,593
When they get to, coney island...

1217
01:18:11,690 --> 01:18:15,146
they gonna hit the trip and the 
brakes are gonna come on.

1218
01:18:18,507 --> 01:18:20,235
- Was that a 33rd?
- Yes, sir.

1219
01:18:20,332 --> 01:18:21,772
How far to the signal?

1220
01:18:21,773 --> 01:18:23,885
- About a tenth of a mile.
- Stop when you get there.

1221
01:18:23,886 --> 01:18:26,190
we're moving out? You got that.

1222
01:18:26,191 --> 01:18:28,303
Slowing down now.

1223
01:18:34,928 --> 01:18:36,272
Are they slowing down?

1224
01:18:36,273 --> 01:18:39,345
They have to, they're coming 
up to the signal point.

1225
01:18:43,666 --> 01:18:45,202
What is that?

1226
01:18:45,203 --> 01:18:48,179
You're the old motorman. You tell me.

1227
01:19:01,428 --> 01:19:05,748
- They stopped just below 33rd street!
- What the hell are they doing?

1228
01:19:06,325 --> 01:19:09,493
- Why that little stop.
- Train has to stop at signal points.

1229
01:19:09,685 --> 01:19:11,701
- Some kind of an override?
- Yeah, yeah...

1230
01:19:11,702 --> 01:19:14,294
some kind of an override. That's right.

1231
01:19:14,295 --> 01:19:19,191
Here we go, Okay lets 
move out. Let's go! Let's go!

1232
01:19:42,520 --> 01:19:45,496
Now's the time of running. Which way?

1233
01:19:45,497 --> 01:19:47,033
Which way?

1234
01:19:52,698 --> 01:19:55,290
She's moving again.
Next stop 28th Street.

1235
01:19:55,291 --> 01:19:58,555
- Why that little stop, huh?
- I told you, signal the points.

1236
01:19:58,556 --> 01:20:00,764
How do you know they didn't 
set the throttle and jump out?

1237
01:20:00,765 --> 01:20:02,685
Doesn't matter, doesn't matter, 
we've got every exit covered. 

1238
01:20:02,686 --> 01:20:03,934
There's no where to go.

1239
01:20:03,935 --> 01:20:06,047
Listen, the throttle can't be 
set, it has to be held...

1240
01:20:06,048 --> 01:20:07,968
It's a fail safe, It's a dead mans switch.

1241
01:20:07,969 --> 01:20:09,985
If it doesn't have a man's 
hand pressing down on it, 

1242
01:20:09,985 --> 01:20:12,385
the train stops cold. Believe me

1243
01:20:12,386 --> 01:20:14,018
they're still on board.

1244
01:20:22,467 --> 01:20:25,635
It's going faster.

1245
01:20:32,260 --> 01:20:35,620
Emri, up the tracks, come on!

1246
01:20:52,133 --> 01:20:54,053
Let's go!

1247
01:20:55,398 --> 01:20:58,950
Come on!

1248
01:20:59,335 --> 01:21:01,063
Come on!

1249
01:21:11,432 --> 01:21:15,848
It's going to derail before 
it get's to, coney island.

1250
01:21:17,385 --> 01:21:20,937
That's it! That's it! Exit right 
there in front of you!

1251
01:21:22,570 --> 01:21:25,257
The fucking train will 
pass, cross over now!

1252
01:21:25,258 --> 01:21:28,330
- What?
- Come on, move!

1253
01:21:31,979 --> 01:21:33,803
Hey!

1254
01:21:46,764 --> 01:21:48,300
Fuck it! Let's go!

1255
01:21:48,301 --> 01:21:51,661
- We need to find him!
- We don't have time. Let's go!

1256
01:22:08,750 --> 01:22:13,454
- I love you. I fucking love you!
- I fucking love you too!

1257
01:22:25,839 --> 01:22:28,623
Hello. Hello.

1258
01:22:42,640 --> 01:22:44,368


1259
01:23:02,608 --> 01:23:04,144


1260
01:23:38,993 --> 01:23:40,433
I'm getting calls...

1261
01:23:40,434 --> 01:23:43,314
Cops are seeing passangers on the train. 

1262
01:23:43,315 --> 01:23:45,043
nobody's in the motorman's booth.

1263
01:23:45,044 --> 01:23:46,868
Believe me they're still on board.

1264
01:23:48,117 --> 01:23:50,421
Okay. It's alright.

1265
01:23:50,422 --> 01:23:53,686
as soon as we pass through the red light
the brakes will stop us automatically.

1266
01:23:53,783 --> 01:23:55,991
Yeah, but they're all green!

1267
01:24:58,679 --> 01:25:01,943
Four stops away.

1268
01:25:03,576 --> 01:25:06,168


1269
01:25:11,065 --> 01:25:14,329
Two stops.

1270
01:25:25,082 --> 01:25:29,690
- Oh, Jesus.
- The train just stopped.

1271
01:25:35,259 --> 01:25:38,619
I really have to go take a piss.

1272
01:25:38,908 --> 01:25:41,692
There's no hijackers on 
board. Just passengers.

1273
01:25:42,940 --> 01:25:45,052
Where was that stop, that
first stop that they made?

1274
01:25:45,053 --> 01:25:46,493
Down the 33rd.

1275
01:25:46,494 --> 01:25:48,990
- That's where the, roosevelt was built.
- The what?

1276
01:25:48,991 --> 01:25:52,159
a derelict tunnel, built 
under the, Waldorf hotel.

1277
01:25:52,160 --> 01:25:53,792
converse everything on that area.

1278
01:25:53,793 --> 01:25:56,961
I want a goddamn parade over it!

1279
01:26:27,394 --> 01:26:29,794
Hey!

1280
01:26:41,891 --> 01:26:45,059
Let's stay calm.

1281
01:27:16,931 --> 01:27:20,387
Hey! Hey!

1282
01:27:22,020 --> 01:27:25,476
Hey! Get out, get out! get out!

1283
01:27:25,573 --> 01:27:28,453
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1284
01:27:58,694 --> 01:28:02,150
Get out of the way!

1285
01:28:17,703 --> 01:28:20,775
Go, go, go!

1286
01:28:44,967 --> 01:28:46,599
- 911, operator.
- Hello, hello!

1287
01:28:46,696 --> 01:28:49,768
- Here is Walter Garber MTA.
- How do you spell that?

1288
01:28:49,769 --> 01:28:53,513
Gar... don't worry about how to 
spell it, Just tell, Lieutenant Camonetti...

1289
01:28:53,514 --> 01:28:57,354
that, Ryder is headed to 
the, manhattan bridge.

1290
01:29:45,163 --> 01:29:47,851
Hey, hey!

1291
01:29:49,292 --> 01:29:51,596
- Is he in there?
- No, no, no.

1292
01:29:51,789 --> 01:29:53,709
- So, where did he go?
- Brooklyn.

1293
01:29:53,710 --> 01:29:55,822
He said he couldn't
Wait. He started walking.

1294
01:29:55,823 --> 01:29:58,031
Fucking city!

1295
01:30:41,519 --> 01:30:43,919
Ryder!

1296
01:30:46,608 --> 01:30:48,528
Don't move!

1297
01:30:48,721 --> 01:30:51,793
So is this how you thought 
the day was gonna end, huh?

1298
01:30:51,794 --> 01:30:54,002
When you put your 
socks on this morning, huh?

1299
01:30:54,099 --> 01:30:56,595
This make you
feel better, Garber?

1300
01:30:56,788 --> 01:30:59,764
- That make everything, okay now?
- No!

1301
01:30:59,957 --> 01:31:02,069
But it's a start.

1302
01:31:03,798 --> 01:31:05,526
Don't move.

1303
01:31:27,798 --> 01:31:30,390
Don't move.

1304
01:31:32,023 --> 01:31:34,135
Hey!

1305
01:31:34,520 --> 01:31:36,632
Garber, baby boy.

1306
01:31:36,633 --> 01:31:38,937
I ain't going back to prison.

1307
01:31:38,938 --> 01:31:42,970
I don't think you got any 
options now or leverage.

1308
01:31:44,219 --> 01:31:48,827
Hey, hey!

1309
01:31:48,924 --> 01:31:51,708
We all owe god a death, I told you that.

1310
01:31:51,901 --> 01:31:53,725
You're wrong, we owe, god life.

1311
01:31:53,726 --> 01:31:56,606
Life and that's the life I 
gave you back today.

1312
01:31:56,607 --> 01:31:59,295
and now you have to
give me something back.

1313
01:32:01,216 --> 01:32:02,944
What are you talking about?

1314
01:32:03,425 --> 01:32:05,537
You got a gun in your hand, 
I want you to use it.

1315
01:32:05,538 --> 01:32:10,242
Shoot me. No! Shoot me before
they shoot me or I'm gonna kill you.

1316
01:32:11,107 --> 01:32:14,275
I will shoot you,
I don't want to, but I will.

1317
01:32:14,275 --> 01:32:15,907
- Hey!
- Thought you cared?

1318
01:32:15,908 --> 01:32:17,732
- No.
- You said, Ryder...

1319
01:32:17,733 --> 01:32:20,037
Don't you have anyone that cares?

1320
01:32:20,038 --> 01:32:21,286
I thought that was you?

1321
01:32:21,383 --> 01:32:24,167
- Come on man!
- I'm not going to shoot you.

1322
01:32:24,168 --> 01:32:26,088
Alright, I'll give you to ten, 
then the deals off.

1323
01:32:26,089 --> 01:32:29,161
I've got a gun. I'm going to use it. 
I'm going to take your life back.

1324
01:32:30,122 --> 01:32:32,618
- Hey!
- Come on, man!

1325
01:32:32,619 --> 01:32:33,771
10...

1326
01:32:33,772 --> 01:32:34,828
9...

1327
01:32:34,829 --> 01:32:35,885
8...

1328
01:32:35,886 --> 01:32:36,942
7...

1329
01:32:36,943 --> 01:32:37,999
6...

1330
01:32:38,000 --> 01:32:39,824
Okay, you want
reach zero?

1331
01:32:39,825 --> 01:32:41,553
Come on, motherfucker!
Shoot me!

1332
01:32:41,554 --> 01:32:44,050
I am not going to shoot you!

1333
01:32:44,435 --> 01:32:46,739
5, 4...

1334
01:32:46,740 --> 01:32:47,988
- Come on!
- Hey!

1335
01:32:47,988 --> 01:32:49,236
3...

1336
01:32:49,237 --> 01:32:51,157
Police. Drop your weapon!

1337
01:32:51,158 --> 01:32:53,654
- I'm disappointed in you.
- 2...

1338
01:33:02,487 --> 01:33:05,943
You're my goddamn hero.

1339
01:33:15,640 --> 01:33:19,576
Drop your weapon!

1340
01:34:00,953 --> 01:34:04,025
Mr. Garber?!

1341
01:34:04,602 --> 01:34:06,810
- Intresting day, huh?
- Yes, sir.

1342
01:34:06,811 --> 01:34:09,403
Just about every day I make a speech...

1343
01:34:09,403 --> 01:34:11,899
and a... it start's with:

1344
01:34:11,900 --> 01:34:15,644
I'd like to thank you on behalf of the
city of, new york, blah, blah, blah...

1345
01:34:15,645 --> 01:34:17,469
and I never know what 
I'm thinking or why.

1346
01:34:18,430 --> 01:34:20,926
But you...

1347
01:34:20,927 --> 01:34:24,383
did a hell of a thing today. You 
went to bat for the city of, new york

1348
01:34:25,248 --> 01:34:28,608
and on behalf of me,
I'd like to thank you.

1349
01:34:28,705 --> 01:34:30,721
Your welcome, I mean,

1350
01:34:30,818 --> 01:34:33,602
It's been an amazing day, everyone's 
been thanking me all day, but I...

1351
01:34:33,603 --> 01:34:35,523
appreciate it. You're welcome.

1352
01:34:35,524 --> 01:34:37,444
I want you to know...

1353
01:34:37,637 --> 01:34:40,997
that tomorrow the city of, new 
york is going to go to bat, for you.

1354
01:34:42,438 --> 01:34:46,470
- In a big way. You understand?
- Yes, sir.

1355
01:34:47,047 --> 01:34:50,215
And the city has a very 
good batting average.

1356
01:34:50,312 --> 01:34:52,520
- Appreciate it.
- Alright.

1357
01:34:53,961 --> 01:34:55,401
I'm going to get home.

1358
01:34:55,498 --> 01:34:56,938
Well take my car.

1359
01:34:56,938 --> 01:34:59,626
- No, I think...
- Put the siren on and everything.

1360
01:34:59,627 --> 01:35:01,835
- Nah... You got the siren on there?
- Yes!

1361
01:35:01,836 --> 01:35:04,236
No, I'll take the subway. But I appreciate it.

1362
01:35:04,237 --> 01:35:05,485

01:35:05,486 --> 01:35:06,830
You know, me, subway all my life.

1364
01:35:06,831 --> 01:35:08,367
I get home faster than you anyway.

1365
01:35:08,368 --> 01:35:12,016
