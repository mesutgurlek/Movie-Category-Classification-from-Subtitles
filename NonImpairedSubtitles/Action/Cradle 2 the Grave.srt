1
00:01:28,993 --> 00:01:30,358
Last delivery's here.

2
00:02:08,866 --> 00:02:10,333
Watch yourself!

3
00:03:18,302 --> 00:03:19,428
X marks the spot.

4
00:03:27,211 --> 00:03:28,508
Christophe here.

5
00:03:28,679 --> 00:03:31,045
- What up?
- Delivery confirmed.

6
00:03:31,215 --> 00:03:33,376
- We're in position.
- Good luck.

7
00:03:33,551 --> 00:03:34,540
We got one shot.

8
00:03:34,685 --> 00:03:38,451
If anybody fucked up and those stones
aren't there, it ain't my problem.

9
00:03:38,589 --> 00:03:41,888
- They're there.
- Not for long. Later.

10
00:04:16,961 --> 00:04:18,360
I got you.

11
00:04:20,664 --> 00:04:21,653
Thank you.

12
00:04:42,820 --> 00:04:44,651
- I'm here for the reception.
- Name?

13
00:04:44,822 --> 00:04:46,153
Angie Rawlins.

14
00:05:32,069 --> 00:05:35,698
You can go on up.
Front elevator to the mezzanine.

15
00:05:38,909 --> 00:05:40,570
Thanks.

16
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:11,401
Where are the stones?

17
00:06:12,710 --> 00:06:14,143
Who the fuck are you?

18
00:06:24,488 --> 00:06:25,921
Who's getting them for you?

19
00:06:26,891 --> 00:06:27,983
Fuck off!

20
00:06:32,463 --> 00:06:34,226
I want a name and a number.

21
00:06:35,833 --> 00:06:37,061
Okay.

22
00:06:37,234 --> 00:06:39,099
- Okay, I'll tell you.
- I know.

23
00:06:39,670 --> 00:06:42,605
I hate these things.
Don't you hate these things?

24
00:06:43,574 --> 00:06:45,201
Just doing my job.

25
00:06:45,743 --> 00:06:48,735
Then again, you never know
who you're gonna meet, right?

26
00:06:53,183 --> 00:06:57,051
I bet you're a lot more fun
than any of those boring people upstairs.

27
00:06:57,755 --> 00:07:00,121
Really, ma'am, I have a job to do.

28
00:07:04,228 --> 00:07:08,358
Right, well, I suppose I should
go see what they're selling.

29
00:07:13,070 --> 00:07:14,697
Tommy.

30
00:07:15,506 --> 00:07:17,531
Change of plans, he's gay. You're up.

31
00:07:17,708 --> 00:07:19,642
- No way.
- Yes, way.

32
00:07:19,810 --> 00:07:20,834
Come on, man!

33
00:07:21,011 --> 00:07:23,707
- All right, Tommy, your turn.
- Hell, no!

34
00:07:23,881 --> 00:07:27,339
This is not a conversation.
Do it! And make it good.

35
00:07:27,518 --> 00:07:28,985
Shit.

36
00:07:29,386 --> 00:07:30,444
Keycard.

37
00:07:30,621 --> 00:07:33,954
So why don't you hold onto my purse.
I shouldn't be too long.

38
00:07:44,268 --> 00:07:45,895
Aloha.

39
00:07:46,337 --> 00:07:47,326
Hi.

40
00:07:49,206 --> 00:07:51,902
I hope you don't take
offense to this...

41
00:07:52,242 --> 00:07:54,904
...but I have such a weakness
for a man in uniform.

42
00:07:55,713 --> 00:07:58,682
- Lf that's your thing.
- Uniforms are my thing.

43
00:07:59,316 --> 00:08:04,253
I mean, every time I see a sailor,
all I can think about is seafood.

44
00:08:04,421 --> 00:08:06,912
I'm actually not supposed
to be talking on duty.

45
00:08:07,091 --> 00:08:08,388
Who's talking?

46
00:08:08,892 --> 00:08:10,519
Baby, this is flirting.

47
00:08:13,097 --> 00:08:17,727
Unless you're one of those big handsome
men letting it all go to waste on a woman.

48
00:08:17,901 --> 00:08:19,926
The world is full of fools.

49
00:08:22,373 --> 00:08:23,397
Yahtzee!

50
00:08:25,909 --> 00:08:28,935
- What's it looking like?
- About a six-second rotation.

51
00:08:33,450 --> 00:08:34,610
Tommy.

52
00:08:37,154 --> 00:08:38,951
But you can call me Rachel.

53
00:08:39,289 --> 00:08:40,722
Douglas.

54
00:08:46,130 --> 00:08:48,155
I just hope I'm not too...

55
00:08:48,332 --> 00:08:49,356
...pretty for you.

56
00:08:49,933 --> 00:08:52,299
- I'm hooked up.
- That bitch.

57
00:08:58,442 --> 00:09:01,411
I like sunsets, puppy dogs...

58
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:04,211
I'm big in the pants.

59
00:09:05,682 --> 00:09:07,377
I can almost tie it in a knot.

60
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:11,878
Let's get the table.

61
00:09:15,259 --> 00:09:19,855
One day I'll have to come in here and
do a little shoplifting and let you catch me.

62
00:09:20,030 --> 00:09:24,262
Resist arrest just so you can
wrestle me down...

63
00:09:25,402 --> 00:09:26,426
...and cuff me.

64
00:09:27,271 --> 00:09:29,239
I can be pretty rough.

65
00:09:30,974 --> 00:09:32,601
Don't get me excited now.

66
00:10:30,033 --> 00:10:31,159
Faith.

67
00:10:31,468 --> 00:10:32,526
Faith.

68
00:10:32,903 --> 00:10:33,927
Faith.

69
00:10:41,845 --> 00:10:43,369
Holy shit!

70
00:10:44,581 --> 00:10:45,980
Earthquake.

71
00:10:47,017 --> 00:10:50,475
But I bet you can hit a 10
on the Richter scale anytime, Douglas.

72
00:11:02,866 --> 00:11:04,299
Let's do it.

73
00:11:12,743 --> 00:11:15,769
All right. Y'all know what to do.
Let's get it on.

74
00:11:41,905 --> 00:11:46,433
- 911, what's your emergency?
- I want to report a robbery in progress.

75
00:11:46,610 --> 00:11:48,805
Robbery in progress. What's the location?

76
00:12:11,535 --> 00:12:14,800
Man, I love colored stones.

77
00:12:15,672 --> 00:12:19,073
This one blue diamond
is at least $2.5 million.

78
00:12:19,243 --> 00:12:21,302
Oh, yeah? So whose stuff we stealing?

79
00:12:21,478 --> 00:12:24,072
- Drug dealers, money launderers...
- Works for me.

80
00:12:25,315 --> 00:12:26,646
This...

81
00:12:28,418 --> 00:12:29,680
This I can use.

82
00:12:34,524 --> 00:12:35,752
T.

83
00:12:35,926 --> 00:12:37,826
Check this out.

84
00:12:39,229 --> 00:12:41,424
This is what we came for.

85
00:12:41,932 --> 00:12:44,196
Yeah, that's what I'm talking about.

86
00:12:44,368 --> 00:12:46,495
Jackpot. The rest is ours.

87
00:12:50,574 --> 00:12:51,598
Yeah.

88
00:12:51,775 --> 00:12:55,267
Your employer betrayed you.
The police are on the way.

89
00:12:55,445 --> 00:12:57,675
- Leave the stones.
- Who is this?

90
00:12:58,515 --> 00:13:00,676
You know the ones I mean.

91
00:13:00,851 --> 00:13:02,876
I'm not gonna be able to do that.

92
00:13:04,655 --> 00:13:05,679
Wrap them up.

93
00:13:20,971 --> 00:13:22,461
Let's go, boys.

94
00:13:23,674 --> 00:13:25,232
Better go move my car.

95
00:13:25,409 --> 00:13:27,001
Five-O at the door, gotta go.

96
00:13:27,577 --> 00:13:30,205
- Move now!
- Time to bounce. Leave this shit.

97
00:13:33,617 --> 00:13:35,585
- Is this your car?
- Yeah, it's my car!

98
00:13:35,752 --> 00:13:37,720
- Get it out of here!
- Move your shit...

99
00:13:37,888 --> 00:13:40,152
- I'll move that, you move this.
- All right.

100
00:13:40,757 --> 00:13:42,748
Let's go. Out of here, right now.

101
00:14:00,944 --> 00:14:02,206
They stopped the trains.

102
00:14:02,379 --> 00:14:05,041
We don't have a lot of time.
Daria comes with me.

103
00:14:05,215 --> 00:14:08,480
I can't tell you how to get there,
but you know where to be.

104
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:11,779
- Faith.
- Faith.

105
00:14:40,650 --> 00:14:41,708
It's clear.

106
00:14:57,501 --> 00:14:59,230
Hold it.

107
00:15:11,448 --> 00:15:12,881
All clear.

108
00:15:15,552 --> 00:15:16,541
Okay.

109
00:15:41,778 --> 00:15:43,302
Nice.

110
00:15:46,016 --> 00:15:48,484
- Train is secure.
- Get this train out of here.

111
00:15:48,652 --> 00:15:49,744
You got it.

112
00:16:07,037 --> 00:16:08,402
The stones?

113
00:16:21,685 --> 00:16:23,243
Watch out!

114
00:16:24,821 --> 00:16:26,345
The bag!

115
00:17:52,309 --> 00:17:53,333
Fuck.

116
00:18:36,353 --> 00:18:38,082
Enjoying California?

117
00:18:38,254 --> 00:18:41,417
Hope we're not here long.
I hate sunshine.

118
00:18:44,227 --> 00:18:45,990
We may have a problem.

119
00:18:47,263 --> 00:18:48,457
The stones?

120
00:18:48,999 --> 00:18:50,990
The Exchange was just robbed.

121
00:18:51,701 --> 00:18:53,999
Let's hope that was part of the plan.

122
00:19:26,202 --> 00:19:27,533
Who's in charge?

123
00:19:28,238 --> 00:19:29,330
Who wants to know?

124
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:38,370
Follow me.

125
00:19:45,555 --> 00:19:48,547
Vanessa. What are you still doing up?

126
00:19:48,725 --> 00:19:51,922
- Just a little longer?
- Just a little longer?

127
00:19:52,095 --> 00:19:54,188
Sweetheart, you have school tomorrow.

128
00:19:54,364 --> 00:19:56,525
Come on. Time for bed.

129
00:19:59,102 --> 00:20:01,400
- Getting heavy!
- No, I'm not.

130
00:20:05,408 --> 00:20:06,807
Wait a minute.

131
00:20:06,976 --> 00:20:09,376
There's something behind your ear.

132
00:20:10,246 --> 00:20:12,077
Please. That is so lame.

133
00:20:12,248 --> 00:20:14,478
- What you mean?
- It's in your hand.

134
00:20:15,852 --> 00:20:19,049
This hand? Or this hand?

135
00:20:20,957 --> 00:20:22,618
Watch.

136
00:20:31,267 --> 00:20:33,963
- How'd you do that?
- Magic.

137
00:20:34,137 --> 00:20:37,334
- Is it for me?
- Of course it's for you.

138
00:20:38,074 --> 00:20:41,009
A diamond for my princess.

139
00:20:43,213 --> 00:20:45,647
It's beautiful.

140
00:20:45,815 --> 00:20:48,340
- So are you.
- I love you, Daddy.

141
00:20:48,518 --> 00:20:50,145
I love you too.

142
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:51,514
Let's say our prayers.

143
00:20:54,557 --> 00:20:58,516
Angels east, angels west,
north and south, just do your best...

144
00:20:58,695 --> 00:21:01,129
...to guard her and watch her
while she rests.

145
00:21:01,297 --> 00:21:02,559
- Amen.
- Amen.

146
00:21:02,732 --> 00:21:04,097
Give me some love.

147
00:21:09,339 --> 00:21:10,829
Can I have another one?

148
00:21:12,108 --> 00:21:14,201
Yeah, you can have another one.

149
00:21:16,913 --> 00:21:18,312
Vanessa's in the bed now.

150
00:21:18,481 --> 00:21:22,110
- She'll be asleep for the rest of the night.
- She won't listen to me.

151
00:21:22,285 --> 00:21:24,845
I'll talk to her. Go to sleep anytime.

152
00:21:25,021 --> 00:21:27,888
- I'm watching TV if you need me.
- All right. Thank you.

153
00:21:29,259 --> 00:21:31,124
Player, what the hell happened?

154
00:21:48,344 --> 00:21:52,940
Should we be considering a long vacation in
a warm foreign climate with no extradition?

155
00:21:53,116 --> 00:21:56,916
The cat that called was only interested
in the black stones.

156
00:21:57,086 --> 00:22:00,283
- Christophe sold us out.
- Or something.

157
00:22:02,358 --> 00:22:05,850
- Oh, God, you made it.
- By the skin of my black ass.

158
00:22:06,029 --> 00:22:10,898
Man, some Chinese dude kicked my ass
all around that goddamn train track.

159
00:22:11,067 --> 00:22:13,501
Asshole busted my earpiece too.

160
00:22:14,103 --> 00:22:17,072
- And the worst part, he snagged the loot.
- Shit!

161
00:22:18,575 --> 00:22:21,237
Maybe it's time to rethink
this no-gun policy shit.

162
00:22:21,411 --> 00:22:23,208
A little ass-whupping ain't shit.

163
00:22:23,379 --> 00:22:26,712
At least you didn't have to play
all foxy with the rent-a-cop!

164
00:22:28,618 --> 00:22:31,519
- This all we got.
- So, what do we do now?

165
00:22:35,291 --> 00:22:37,725
- Wait to hear from me.
- So where are you going?

166
00:22:38,361 --> 00:22:40,352
I'm going to get some answers.

167
00:22:43,533 --> 00:22:46,297
- Hold up, dog. I got your back.
- I got this one.

168
00:22:47,036 --> 00:22:49,163
But if I need you, I'll call you.

169
00:22:49,672 --> 00:22:51,697
- All right.
- All right?

170
00:22:53,343 --> 00:22:55,140
Be careful.

171
00:23:06,589 --> 00:23:09,717
So this is Mr. Christophe.

172
00:23:10,126 --> 00:23:12,617
Apparently we're not his first visitors today.

173
00:23:12,795 --> 00:23:15,525
Please, Señor Ling, have mercy.

174
00:23:15,698 --> 00:23:18,895
Whatever you're going to say,
make it the truth.

175
00:23:20,470 --> 00:23:22,768
You may not have another opportunity.

176
00:23:23,573 --> 00:23:25,768
I'll tell you what you wanna know.

177
00:23:31,347 --> 00:23:32,746
Bang!

178
00:23:32,916 --> 00:23:34,315
You like it?

179
00:23:35,618 --> 00:23:37,085
It's all right.

180
00:23:39,822 --> 00:23:42,985
You want it? I'll make you
a deal on it, ammo included.

181
00:23:43,159 --> 00:23:48,495
It's got reactive armor, Browning
.50-caliber, 7.62 M-60 machine gun.

182
00:23:48,665 --> 00:23:50,565
And that cannon there, that's 90 mm.

183
00:23:50,733 --> 00:23:54,225
Good around the bad areas of town.
Keeps neighborhood kids in line.

184
00:23:54,404 --> 00:23:55,837
- I'll pass.
- How about this?

185
00:23:56,005 --> 00:23:59,338
- A Marine Corps Assault Hovercraft?
- I'm here on other business.

186
00:23:59,509 --> 00:24:02,069
Hey, Arch! We're out of room
in the storage.

187
00:24:02,245 --> 00:24:05,772
All right, put them in my office
and be careful, they're expensive.

188
00:24:06,082 --> 00:24:07,447
Well, not expensive to me.

189
00:24:07,617 --> 00:24:11,314
Hey, listen, you weren't by any chance
downtown today, were you, Tony?

190
00:24:11,487 --> 00:24:12,954
Not at all.

191
00:24:14,324 --> 00:24:15,985
I didn't think so.

192
00:24:17,226 --> 00:24:20,457
- Ever see a black diamond?
- I've seen a white diamond, pink...

193
00:24:20,630 --> 00:24:24,066
...yellow, blue ones. I've seen Neil Diamond.
Awesome in concert.

194
00:24:24,233 --> 00:24:25,700
He's in town in two weeks...

195
00:24:32,475 --> 00:24:34,340
Never seen a black diamond.

196
00:24:36,713 --> 00:24:38,180
Not like this.

197
00:24:40,717 --> 00:24:44,016
- Wow. You got me.
- Find out what they're worth.

198
00:24:44,187 --> 00:24:46,451
- Is there a timetable on this?
- Yesterday.

199
00:24:46,622 --> 00:24:48,749
- That's what I figured.
- I'll be back.

200
00:24:48,925 --> 00:24:51,860
Gonna return a favor to a friend.

201
00:25:36,539 --> 00:25:37,597
Looks dead to me.

202
00:25:39,475 --> 00:25:43,275
- Guess you got to him first.
- Not me, not my style.

203
00:25:43,446 --> 00:25:45,641
You're the one that called me.

204
00:25:47,016 --> 00:25:49,610
The same one that bumped into Miles.

205
00:25:51,220 --> 00:25:52,949
Who the fuck are you?

206
00:25:53,122 --> 00:25:56,091
- My name is Su.
- All right, Su, I'm Sally.

207
00:25:56,259 --> 00:25:58,921
- I want the black stones.
- Make me an offer.

208
00:26:00,930 --> 00:26:04,798
- You can walk out of here alive.
- No deal.

209
00:26:15,044 --> 00:26:16,409
Leave a message.

210
00:26:16,579 --> 00:26:19,776
Mr. Fait, I know you're there.
Pick up the phone.

211
00:26:22,118 --> 00:26:24,177
We need to talk, now.

212
00:26:26,189 --> 00:26:27,622
Who the fuck is this?

213
00:26:27,790 --> 00:26:31,123
The man for whom Christophe arranged
to have the black stones...

214
00:26:31,260 --> 00:26:34,787
...brought into the country
and deposited at the Jewelry Exchange.

215
00:26:34,931 --> 00:26:36,489
The man who wants them back.

216
00:26:37,166 --> 00:26:39,327
- Now.
- All right, well, how much?

217
00:26:40,136 --> 00:26:43,628
Maybe you didn't understand me.
The stones are already mine.

218
00:26:43,806 --> 00:26:44,830
Yo, check this out?

219
00:26:45,007 --> 00:26:47,942
I got them, I'm selling them,
put the money on the wood!

220
00:26:48,511 --> 00:26:50,035
I don't have time for this.

221
00:26:50,213 --> 00:26:52,181
That's your last offer?

222
00:26:52,515 --> 00:26:54,642
I can be a very dangerous man, Mr. Fait.

223
00:26:56,552 --> 00:26:59,282
I don't get it. Do I look like
the Salvation Army?

224
00:26:59,455 --> 00:27:03,391
I bust my ass all night and got nothing
to show for it. You know what, dog?

225
00:27:03,559 --> 00:27:05,925
It don't even matter who the fuck you are.

226
00:27:06,095 --> 00:27:08,120
I ain't got nothing for you.

227
00:27:54,544 --> 00:27:55,875
Shit!

228
00:28:13,329 --> 00:28:14,853
Shit!

229
00:29:05,548 --> 00:29:06,742
Give us the stones.

230
00:29:07,516 --> 00:29:09,643
How many times I got to tell you people?

231
00:29:09,819 --> 00:29:13,414
I'm a businessman.
Make me a fucking offer!

232
00:29:14,757 --> 00:29:16,588
Here's your offer.

233
00:29:17,059 --> 00:29:20,551
That shit ain't gonna work, homes,
because I don't have the stones!

234
00:29:20,730 --> 00:29:22,027
Tell us where they are.

235
00:29:35,611 --> 00:29:36,600
Come on!

236
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:05,424
The car!

237
00:31:18,214 --> 00:31:20,273
What is it with these fucking stones?

238
00:31:23,953 --> 00:31:25,818
- Yeah.
- It's Archie.

239
00:31:25,988 --> 00:31:28,388
Bad news. We got a problem.

240
00:31:28,657 --> 00:31:32,525
I put word out on the street
to get some info on the stones.

241
00:31:32,695 --> 00:31:35,528
Next thing I know,
the Wu-Tang Clan shows up here.

242
00:31:35,698 --> 00:31:37,325
Three important elements here.

243
00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:38,694
One, I'm outmanned...

244
00:31:38,868 --> 00:31:42,429
...two, they're heavily armed,
and three, they're about to pound me.

245
00:31:42,605 --> 00:31:46,234
- I can't watch anymore. I got a few licks in...
- Let's see the rest.

246
00:31:46,409 --> 00:31:48,900
Did you see my new DVD players?

247
00:31:49,078 --> 00:31:50,136
All right! Okay!

248
00:31:50,579 --> 00:31:52,843
- Give me that!
- I forgot I had them. Sorry!

249
00:31:53,015 --> 00:31:57,679
I could've resisted more. But they could've
beat me into a coma or killed me.

250
00:31:57,853 --> 00:32:01,789
How could I tell you where the stones
are if I'm dead or on life support?

251
00:32:01,957 --> 00:32:04,653
So I threw in the towel,
reluctantly, for your sake.

252
00:32:04,827 --> 00:32:07,625
Okay, so you saved yourself
to tell me something.

253
00:32:07,797 --> 00:32:09,628
- So tell me.
- What?

254
00:32:09,799 --> 00:32:12,097
- Who was it?
- I don't know.

255
00:32:12,268 --> 00:32:14,600
- What did they say?
- Well, they said:

256
00:32:14,770 --> 00:32:17,864
"Give me the stones,
you fat cracker motherfucker."

257
00:32:18,040 --> 00:32:19,940
- That sort of thing.
- That's it?

258
00:32:20,109 --> 00:32:23,510
That's pretty bad.
Cracker is kind of racist.

259
00:32:23,679 --> 00:32:27,080
Thanks for keeping yourself alive
long enough to tell me nothing!

260
00:32:27,249 --> 00:32:30,013
- Did you call the police?
- Did I call the police?

261
00:32:30,186 --> 00:32:32,177
Look around here, are you crazy?

262
00:32:32,354 --> 00:32:35,289
Only question now is,
who's behind this jack move?

263
00:32:35,458 --> 00:32:40,225
I don't know, but they got some great guns
I can't even get. U.S. Special Forces only.

264
00:32:40,930 --> 00:32:43,421
- Chambers.
- Jump Chambers?

265
00:32:43,599 --> 00:32:45,066
I hope not.

266
00:32:47,436 --> 00:32:50,064
Hey, who's Jump Chambers?

267
00:32:50,239 --> 00:32:52,901
This guy's in on everything
that goes down in town.

268
00:32:53,075 --> 00:32:56,943
The only one I know that can get those
weapons. And he has a fucking army.

269
00:32:57,112 --> 00:32:59,637
You're on your own,
I don't need the headache.

270
00:32:59,815 --> 00:33:02,682
And since I'm totally fucked, who are you?

271
00:33:03,586 --> 00:33:05,019
Yeah, you got an ID?

272
00:33:05,187 --> 00:33:07,712
Buddy? Picture, preferably?

273
00:33:08,891 --> 00:33:10,017
Yeah, all right.

274
00:33:12,661 --> 00:33:14,856
- This means nothing to me.
- Let me see it.

275
00:33:16,232 --> 00:33:19,759
It's Taiwan, Central Security Bureau.

276
00:33:19,935 --> 00:33:22,267
- Taiwanese Intelligence.
- Read Chinese?

277
00:33:22,438 --> 00:33:24,429
No, but I know "cop"
in every language.

278
00:33:24,607 --> 00:33:26,939
What are you?
Some kind of kung fu James Bond?

279
00:33:27,076 --> 00:33:30,273
- The stones belong to Taiwan.
- They belong to Chambers now.

280
00:33:31,313 --> 00:33:34,942
- I'm starting to hate this fucking phone.
- I'll get you a new one.

281
00:33:35,117 --> 00:33:38,018
- Yeah.
- I hope you've reconsidered.

282
00:33:38,187 --> 00:33:40,587
Oh, it's bad-ass! What's up, homes?

283
00:33:41,357 --> 00:33:44,554
You've made this difficult, Mr. Fait.
Let me make it easy.

284
00:33:44,727 --> 00:33:47,560
I can't wait to hear this.

285
00:33:49,198 --> 00:33:50,722
Daddy, Daddy, Daddy!

286
00:33:53,969 --> 00:33:57,405
She's very pretty in her pink pajamas,
aren't you, Vanessa?

287
00:33:57,573 --> 00:34:00,303
- Son of a...
- I want my stones, Mr. Fait.

288
00:34:00,809 --> 00:34:02,800
Let me talk to the Chinese gentleman.

289
00:34:02,978 --> 00:34:04,946
Don't you fucking touch her!

290
00:34:05,114 --> 00:34:07,480
The Chinese gentleman, please.

291
00:34:14,123 --> 00:34:16,921
He has my daughter.
He wants to talk to you.

292
00:34:18,394 --> 00:34:19,452
Jesus, Tony.

293
00:34:41,517 --> 00:34:43,576
What happened? What did you just do?

294
00:34:43,752 --> 00:34:47,244
I said I have the stones,
and I won't negotiate for your daughter.

295
00:34:47,423 --> 00:34:48,583
- What?
- That's stupid.

296
00:34:48,757 --> 00:34:51,658
It will confuse him,
buy us time, keep her alive.

297
00:34:51,827 --> 00:34:55,319
What the hell are you talking about?
This motherfucker has my baby!

298
00:34:55,497 --> 00:34:57,863
Look, I know him.

299
00:34:58,434 --> 00:35:02,427
I want the stones, you want your daughter.
We can help each other.

300
00:35:13,415 --> 00:35:15,110
So I'm stuck with you.

301
00:35:25,194 --> 00:35:26,320
Get in.

302
00:35:35,571 --> 00:35:37,505
We gotta see Chambers.

303
00:36:02,531 --> 00:36:04,226
Find a place to put her.

304
00:36:06,301 --> 00:36:09,202
My daddy's gonna come and kick your butts!

305
00:36:14,143 --> 00:36:16,270
Su says he has the stones.

306
00:36:17,379 --> 00:36:21,338
But why cut me off?
Why not negotiate for the girl?

307
00:36:22,251 --> 00:36:23,980
Doesn't make any sense.

308
00:36:24,987 --> 00:36:27,455
Buyers fly in tomorrow.
Should we stop them?

309
00:36:27,823 --> 00:36:30,087
We'll never regain their confidence.

310
00:36:30,559 --> 00:36:34,393
We need information.
Find the right people, pay whatever it costs.

311
00:36:35,998 --> 00:36:40,162
Something's not right.
Something's happening with the stones.

312
00:36:40,703 --> 00:36:42,466
What about the girl?

313
00:36:43,172 --> 00:36:46,107
We'll need her. She stays alive...

314
00:36:46,241 --> 00:36:47,765
...for now.

315
00:36:50,112 --> 00:36:53,775
Yeah, I'm on my way to see Chambers now.
No, I don't have a choice.

316
00:36:53,949 --> 00:36:57,214
Get in touch with his people,
let him know I need to see him.

317
00:36:57,553 --> 00:36:58,577
I'll call you back.

318
00:37:02,257 --> 00:37:03,884
I'm sorry about your daughter.

319
00:37:06,962 --> 00:37:09,089
- How old is she?
- Mind your business.

320
00:37:16,839 --> 00:37:19,831
She's 8. She'll be 9 in September.

321
00:37:20,843 --> 00:37:22,777
Mine is 15.

322
00:37:23,312 --> 00:37:26,440
- Boyfriends?
- Never. I'd kill them.

323
00:37:26,615 --> 00:37:28,412
You wish.

324
00:37:32,054 --> 00:37:35,114
- About time you PMD.
- PMD?

325
00:37:35,290 --> 00:37:37,155
Yeah, put me down.

326
00:37:37,326 --> 00:37:39,260
What's this all about?

327
00:37:40,229 --> 00:37:44,188
- The stones are not what you think they are.
- No shit.

328
00:37:45,300 --> 00:37:49,760
- What about this guy who has Vanessa?
- He's exactly what you think he is.

329
00:37:50,405 --> 00:37:52,896
A thief and a killer.

330
00:37:56,578 --> 00:37:58,045
Great.

331
00:37:59,181 --> 00:38:00,443
Fucking great.

332
00:38:04,653 --> 00:38:06,120
I want my daddy!

333
00:38:06,622 --> 00:38:07,646
Keys.

334
00:38:10,259 --> 00:38:12,124
Where'd you get this piece of shit?

335
00:38:12,294 --> 00:38:16,958
Let's just say Grandma and Grandpa have
a long walk back from the campground.

336
00:38:17,132 --> 00:38:20,067
- You sure you cleaned it out?
- It's clean, all right.

337
00:38:23,806 --> 00:38:26,070
- Shut up!
- You shut up!

338
00:38:26,942 --> 00:38:28,500
Go to sleep!

339
00:38:47,996 --> 00:38:51,727
Angels east, angels west...

340
00:38:51,900 --> 00:38:54,698
...north and south, just do your best...

341
00:38:55,204 --> 00:38:58,002
...to guard her and watch her
while she rests.

342
00:38:58,640 --> 00:39:00,369
Amen.

343
00:39:27,936 --> 00:39:29,961
Who rang that bell?

344
00:39:32,140 --> 00:39:37,077
Here are your visitors, Mr. Chambers.
And the morning mail.

345
00:39:42,050 --> 00:39:43,608
Hey, yo, Vogel.

346
00:39:44,586 --> 00:39:46,451
My DVD's broke.

347
00:39:46,622 --> 00:39:49,022
Get you a new one straight away,
Mr. Chambers.

348
00:39:49,191 --> 00:39:51,455
Well, well, well. Tony Fait.

349
00:39:51,627 --> 00:39:55,961
Come all this way to visit his
old pal Jump. Who's the gook?

350
00:39:56,565 --> 00:39:58,396
Chinese guy.

351
00:40:01,169 --> 00:40:02,431
Hey.

352
00:40:04,039 --> 00:40:06,371
No shoes in my crib, man.

353
00:40:21,523 --> 00:40:26,551
- How you doing, Jump?
- Don't waste my fucking time, nigga.

354
00:40:26,862 --> 00:40:30,320
- Look, I got a problem.
- How's Daria?

355
00:40:30,966 --> 00:40:33,992
- Good.
- Yeah, she always was good.

356
00:40:34,169 --> 00:40:39,129
From the moment I saw her to the
moment you took her away from me.

357
00:40:40,809 --> 00:40:42,936
- Problem?
- The black stones.

358
00:40:43,111 --> 00:40:45,477
That bitch brought in too.

359
00:40:45,647 --> 00:40:49,674
I made a lot of money with her, but
that's all stopped now. You stopped that.

360
00:40:49,851 --> 00:40:52,718
You decided it was okay
to put an end to that.

361
00:40:53,789 --> 00:40:56,189
- Black stones, what?
- I need them back.

362
00:40:56,358 --> 00:40:59,885
The only smart thing you did
was not pimping her yourself.

363
00:41:00,062 --> 00:41:04,158
See, because then I'd have been real
heated and you'd have been real dead.

364
00:41:04,333 --> 00:41:06,096
But you don't pimp, right?

365
00:41:06,268 --> 00:41:10,898
You're just a thief in the night,
stealing shit that don't belong to you.

366
00:41:12,274 --> 00:41:13,571
Hey.

367
00:41:20,749 --> 00:41:23,081
- What? He don't talk?
- I don't speak Korean.

368
00:41:26,655 --> 00:41:28,316
Yeah, well, I do.

369
00:41:28,957 --> 00:41:31,255
Bought me a little Korean
spot downtown.

370
00:41:31,426 --> 00:41:34,259
Bringing in the soul brothers
24-7, 365.

371
00:41:34,429 --> 00:41:38,331
Black man gouging Koreans.
Ain't that a switch, Chick?

372
00:41:39,534 --> 00:41:45,063
Them motherfuckers got faces like walls,
but they love to drink and look at naked girls.

373
00:41:45,240 --> 00:41:48,107
Place ain't no shitbox.
You should see my office.

374
00:41:48,276 --> 00:41:52,042
Got that shit decked out
like a kabuki love palace.

375
00:41:52,214 --> 00:41:54,546
You know what that is, right?

376
00:41:55,117 --> 00:41:58,518
Why don't you roll by sometime?
Check out the poon.

377
00:41:59,121 --> 00:42:01,817
My little girl is mixed up in this.

378
00:42:03,892 --> 00:42:06,793
If I don't get those stones back,
she's dead.

379
00:42:10,399 --> 00:42:13,163
What do you want, man? I mean...

380
00:42:17,406 --> 00:42:21,206
- I'm begging.
- You know, I was thinking.

381
00:42:22,244 --> 00:42:26,544
That was a big heist. Risky heist.

382
00:42:27,215 --> 00:42:33,450
What would make a man go through that
kind of trouble, take that kind of heat?

383
00:42:36,658 --> 00:42:38,717
Gotta be something good.

384
00:42:41,096 --> 00:42:43,257
Something valuable.

385
00:42:46,701 --> 00:42:48,293
Jump...

386
00:42:49,371 --> 00:42:51,737
...it's my little girl.

387
00:42:52,541 --> 00:42:54,236
Make another one.

388
00:42:54,409 --> 00:42:56,604
You mother...

389
00:42:56,945 --> 00:42:58,572
Drama.

390
00:42:59,481 --> 00:43:01,676
I see the slope's no dope.

391
00:43:03,785 --> 00:43:07,186
Got a lot of offspring running
around, brother.

392
00:43:07,355 --> 00:43:09,414
Big score is once in a lifetime.

393
00:43:09,591 --> 00:43:12,082
- Yo, let me at him.
- Go ahead. Shit.

394
00:43:22,170 --> 00:43:23,637
Say hey to Daria for me.

395
00:43:24,806 --> 00:43:27,331
Don't forget your fucking shoes.

396
00:43:32,981 --> 00:43:33,970
Pussy.

397
00:43:37,652 --> 00:43:42,521
I used to really look up to that guy.
Used to want to be just like him.

398
00:43:42,691 --> 00:43:47,822
- In Taiwan, I can make him talk.
- Yeah, well, this ain't Taiwan.

399
00:43:48,029 --> 00:43:52,125
Only thing we can do now is try to find
out where the stones are and get them.

400
00:43:52,300 --> 00:43:55,531
- You make it sound easy.
- It won't be.

401
00:44:03,445 --> 00:44:06,073
- What?
- They're at his club.

402
00:44:06,481 --> 00:44:08,415
How do you know?

403
00:44:08,583 --> 00:44:12,451
I know. I can just feel it.
It's never happened to you?

404
00:44:12,621 --> 00:44:14,145
No.

405
00:44:14,322 --> 00:44:20,727
- Thought you Chinese were all mystical.
- We like to gamble. Not guess.

406
00:44:21,329 --> 00:44:27,325
It's no guess, but I could be wrong.
I'll hit the club, you go see Archie.

407
00:44:28,270 --> 00:44:29,794
Why?

408
00:44:30,572 --> 00:44:34,338
- He has to remember something.
- What if he can't?

409
00:44:34,509 --> 00:44:37,501
Pretend it's Taiwan.
Make him remember.

410
00:44:45,520 --> 00:44:48,887
Hey. Get away from here.
What are you doing?

411
00:44:49,057 --> 00:44:51,787
Relax. I'm just seeing if I can
help with something.

412
00:44:51,960 --> 00:44:55,361
Well, you can't. It's very delicate
equipment, so just stay away.

413
00:44:55,530 --> 00:44:58,590
All right? Stay away from the truck.

414
00:44:59,701 --> 00:45:02,067
- What?
- Stay away from my fucking truck!

415
00:45:02,237 --> 00:45:04,364
Okay, stop it.

416
00:45:06,208 --> 00:45:07,607
Backing away.

417
00:45:08,543 --> 00:45:10,067
Backing away.

418
00:45:11,546 --> 00:45:13,343
Someone give the geek his Ritalin.

419
00:45:13,481 --> 00:45:15,108
At least he's doing his job...

420
00:45:15,250 --> 00:45:19,118
...which is more than I can say
for some people. Tape her up and gag her.

421
00:45:19,287 --> 00:45:21,380
I want my daddy! I want my daddy!

422
00:45:21,523 --> 00:45:23,718
I want my daddy! I want my daddy!

423
00:45:23,892 --> 00:45:26,417
I want my daddy! I want my daddy!

424
00:45:26,595 --> 00:45:28,961
- I want my daddy!
- Let go of me!

425
00:45:29,130 --> 00:45:30,927
- Shut up!
- I want my daddy!

426
00:45:31,099 --> 00:45:33,067
- I want my daddy!
- Waste of time.

427
00:45:33,235 --> 00:45:35,465
I can think of a way of shutting you up.

428
00:45:38,540 --> 00:45:40,269
Yes!

429
00:45:40,575 --> 00:45:43,135
Shit! She's got the key!

430
00:46:38,066 --> 00:46:39,897
- Precious Daria.
- What's up, Odion?

431
00:46:40,035 --> 00:46:41,832
Long time, no see.

432
00:46:42,003 --> 00:46:45,996
- So, what brings you around here?
- Sometimes you need to see old friends.

433
00:46:46,541 --> 00:46:49,066
- What? You got trouble?
- With a capital T.

434
00:46:49,744 --> 00:46:53,680
Tony Fait? Thought you two
were tight. Bonnie and Clyde.

435
00:46:54,749 --> 00:46:56,717
Yeah, it used to be that way.

436
00:46:56,885 --> 00:46:58,819
Not taking care of me these days.

437
00:46:59,921 --> 00:47:03,254
Kid's all he cares about.
It's a shame, huh?

438
00:47:03,425 --> 00:47:07,259
- So, what you want me to do?
- I don't know.

439
00:47:07,696 --> 00:47:10,358
Probably nothing you can do.
I just thought...

440
00:47:10,532 --> 00:47:11,897
...you know.

441
00:47:14,002 --> 00:47:18,564
This is crazy. I don't even know what I was
thinking. I shouldn't be in here. Sorry.

442
00:47:18,740 --> 00:47:21,334
No, hold up, hold up. Girls.

443
00:47:21,509 --> 00:47:26,105
- Give us a minute. Champagne?
- Yes.

444
00:47:29,884 --> 00:47:31,408
I got it.

445
00:47:32,153 --> 00:47:36,590
- So you looking for a job?
- I need something.

446
00:47:37,792 --> 00:47:39,783
How about you work here?

447
00:47:40,762 --> 00:47:44,391
How would Jump feel about me
coming back and all?

448
00:47:44,566 --> 00:47:47,797
You let me worry about Jump Chambers.
In the meantime...

449
00:47:48,737 --> 00:47:52,798
...how about we go to my office
and we talk about this a little bit more?

450
00:47:54,542 --> 00:47:57,909
It's not exactly boxing matches,
it's a lot more dangerous.

451
00:47:58,079 --> 00:48:00,240
No gloves or nothing, no rules, period.

452
00:48:00,415 --> 00:48:04,715
It's huge money. It's very illegal.
They hold it during the day to fool cops.

453
00:48:04,886 --> 00:48:08,049
The man you remember,
how do you know he'll be here?

454
00:48:08,223 --> 00:48:12,250
I don't, but this is Chambers' operation,
so it's a damn good place to start.

455
00:48:12,660 --> 00:48:14,321
Here we are.

456
00:48:16,331 --> 00:48:19,630
- This is a private club. You can't come in.
- It's me, Archie.

457
00:48:19,801 --> 00:48:23,703
- Everybody likes me here.
- Hey, it's that asshole Archie again.

458
00:48:24,973 --> 00:48:26,565
How can you recognize him?

459
00:48:26,741 --> 00:48:30,108
Well, I didn't see his face,
but they all kind of look the same.

460
00:48:30,278 --> 00:48:32,246
Of course so do you guys.

461
00:48:32,647 --> 00:48:36,344
No offense. But I will remember
that pinky ring because it was awesome.

462
00:48:36,518 --> 00:48:40,887
He's got, like, a 10-carat, round cut,
square setting, good color and clarity.

463
00:48:41,055 --> 00:48:44,855
I remember thinking about the damage
it'd do to my face if he hit me.

464
00:48:53,435 --> 00:48:57,531
I gotta make sure Mr. Pinky Ring doesn't
recognize me, so I got a disguise.

465
00:48:57,705 --> 00:49:00,936
- How do we get in?
- Leave it to me. I'll take care of it.

466
00:49:01,109 --> 00:49:05,478
Hey, buddy. How you doing? How's
that armor-plated Lincoln I sold you?

467
00:49:05,647 --> 00:49:07,979
- Cops stopped me.
- They do that sometimes.

468
00:49:08,149 --> 00:49:09,946
- Car was fucking hot, Archie.
- Hey.

469
00:49:10,518 --> 00:49:14,284
I didn't steal it, but stop by the shop
tomorrow. I'll make it right.

470
00:49:14,456 --> 00:49:16,651
- You know the rules. No guests.
- He's not.

471
00:49:16,825 --> 00:49:18,816
He's a fighter. An unofficial entry.

472
00:49:19,227 --> 00:49:21,286
- Him? Is he any good?
- Is he...?

473
00:49:21,463 --> 00:49:23,522
He'll kick all those chumps' asses!

474
00:49:23,698 --> 00:49:25,825
He'll go Chinese on them!
Teeth will fly.

475
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:28,628
Blood will splatter!
It'll be awesome! Step aside.

476
00:49:28,803 --> 00:49:30,566
No way, Archie. No more favors.

477
00:49:30,738 --> 00:49:33,229
What? You've got to be shitting me.

478
00:49:33,408 --> 00:49:36,969
Somebody's getting a letter from
the Better Business Bureau.

479
00:49:37,145 --> 00:49:38,976
Excuse us.

480
00:49:42,383 --> 00:49:44,874
You're number 12.
Go get your ass kicked.

481
00:49:49,457 --> 00:49:50,981
I didn't come here to fight.

482
00:49:51,159 --> 00:49:54,094
You don't have to fight,
I just said that to get us in.

483
00:50:13,081 --> 00:50:14,708
Come on!

484
00:50:16,918 --> 00:50:19,512
Get up! Oh, yeah.

485
00:50:19,988 --> 00:50:21,250
Get up!

486
00:50:23,791 --> 00:50:25,053
Yeah! Yeah!

487
00:50:25,226 --> 00:50:27,023
Tear his eye out!

488
00:50:30,131 --> 00:50:33,623
- On a good day, over a million bucks will...
- Just find the ring.

489
00:50:33,768 --> 00:50:37,534
- All right. Okay.
- Knock him out.

490
00:50:38,339 --> 00:50:40,364
- You know...
- Bullshit.

491
00:50:40,542 --> 00:50:45,479
...this could take a little while.
All right, come on. Let's go.

492
00:51:06,801 --> 00:51:07,426
Sit down.

493
00:51:21,565 --> 00:51:23,897
Why don't you put on some music?

494
00:51:28,906 --> 00:51:30,339
Slower.

495
00:51:33,844 --> 00:51:35,869
Just relax.

496
00:51:37,081 --> 00:51:38,571
And watch.

497
00:51:57,935 --> 00:51:59,562
This looks good.

498
00:52:01,272 --> 00:52:03,502
Set it up, tie it at the bottom.

499
00:52:03,674 --> 00:52:09,510
- Tommy, go.
- Here come the bug man.

500
00:52:24,695 --> 00:52:25,957
Excuse me.

501
00:52:26,130 --> 00:52:28,325
Hey, what's going on, player?

502
00:52:35,873 --> 00:52:39,570
- Yo, what the hell are you doing?
- Oh, pest control, player.

503
00:52:42,246 --> 00:52:45,215
- Don't tell me you didn't get the notice.
- What notice?

504
00:52:45,383 --> 00:52:49,843
That's what burn my ass to the bone,
a brother just trying to make a living...

505
00:52:50,020 --> 00:52:52,545
You know what?
That's beside the point.

506
00:52:52,690 --> 00:52:56,251
If you had gotten your notice,
you'd realize the city has a new ordinance...

507
00:52:56,394 --> 00:52:59,261
...saying I gotta spray businesses
catering to foreigners.

508
00:52:59,430 --> 00:53:00,727
How come?

509
00:53:00,898 --> 00:53:04,629
The foreigners are bringing over
them scary-ass foreign bugs, man.

510
00:53:04,769 --> 00:53:09,103
They coming here in their luggage.
It's my job to prevent possible infestation...

511
00:53:09,273 --> 00:53:12,640
...and contamination. That's my job.
- We doing business inside.

512
00:53:12,777 --> 00:53:15,712
I can't let you come and hose
the place with bug spray.

513
00:53:15,880 --> 00:53:20,044
Maybe you need to talk to your manager
about that plan because that's my job.

514
00:53:20,217 --> 00:53:23,584
- Manager's busy.
- Okay, that's your call.

515
00:53:23,754 --> 00:53:25,381
That is your call, player.

516
00:53:26,223 --> 00:53:28,282
But just remember this.

517
00:53:28,459 --> 00:53:30,689
First thing tomorrow morning...

518
00:53:30,861 --> 00:53:32,192
...the city...

519
00:53:32,863 --> 00:53:36,594
...they gonna send their quarantine people.
- Quarantine people?

520
00:53:36,734 --> 00:53:38,861
They gonna shut you down.
Non-compliance.

521
00:53:39,003 --> 00:53:41,335
Wait, wait, wait. Hold on.

522
00:53:41,505 --> 00:53:44,406
Hold, man, come here.
Let me talk to you for a minute.

523
00:53:48,112 --> 00:53:50,410
You ain't fucking with me, are you?

524
00:53:52,950 --> 00:53:55,077
See that little motherfucker up there?

525
00:53:55,252 --> 00:53:56,947
That's me. That's me.

526
00:53:57,755 --> 00:54:02,419
I am a licensed exterminator, man.
Why I gotta fuck with you?

527
00:54:02,960 --> 00:54:06,396
Look. Come here. Let's do this.

528
00:54:06,564 --> 00:54:09,965
You take me to a small place.
Small room. Office or something.

529
00:54:10,134 --> 00:54:12,466
Someplace upstairs,
away from the customers.

530
00:54:12,636 --> 00:54:17,039
That way when I set these bombs off,
the fumes, they don't go down there.

531
00:54:17,208 --> 00:54:20,666
And then we come back later
and fix the rest. All right?

532
00:54:21,545 --> 00:54:25,072
- Okay. Get a couple bombs. Come on.
- That's what I'm talking about.

533
00:54:25,249 --> 00:54:28,150
You don't wanna be bit by one
of these motherfuckers.

534
00:54:28,319 --> 00:54:32,756
Swell you up all around the neck. Look
like Oprah. Come on, get the door.

535
00:56:18,996 --> 00:56:23,023
You know, some of these bugs
they got E. Coli and Mad Cow disease.

536
00:56:23,200 --> 00:56:27,432
Check this shit out.
Is this Jackie Chan's office?

537
00:56:28,405 --> 00:56:30,305
Oh, snap!

538
00:56:30,941 --> 00:56:32,875
Man, you got a Jacuzzi?

539
00:56:33,010 --> 00:56:35,535
Look at the ball.
How many freaks you get in here?

540
00:56:35,713 --> 00:56:39,274
I bet you sit yours right there on
that ball. Sit on the ball, baby.

541
00:56:39,450 --> 00:56:42,510
Sit on the ball. Keep it wet, baby.

542
00:56:42,686 --> 00:56:45,211
- Smack! Smack it! Smack it!
- Hey! Hey!

543
00:56:45,389 --> 00:56:49,325
- Just do your thing and go, bro.
- Yeah, all right, player.

544
00:56:54,565 --> 00:56:57,398
All right. Look here.
Now you keep the door closed...

545
00:56:57,568 --> 00:57:01,937
...and give this shit a full hour
before anybody steps in here, all right?

546
00:57:02,106 --> 00:57:03,368
Damn.

547
00:57:06,310 --> 00:57:07,902
Damn.

548
00:57:10,447 --> 00:57:12,074
- You're clear.
- Let's do it.

549
00:57:12,249 --> 00:57:13,944
All right.

550
00:57:26,830 --> 00:57:29,298
- You're crazy.
- I'm a father.

551
00:58:05,869 --> 00:58:07,996
- Blow it.
- Daria...

552
00:58:08,172 --> 00:58:09,605
...get ready to move.

553
00:58:15,646 --> 00:58:17,375
What was that?

554
00:58:18,315 --> 00:58:20,545
"Sometimes you just need
an old friend?"

555
00:58:26,056 --> 00:58:29,719
- It came from the office.
- Watch her. Don't let her leave.

556
00:58:39,369 --> 00:58:41,064
- They're not here?
- They're here.

557
00:58:41,205 --> 00:58:44,231
- They're just somewhere else.
- What are you talking about?

558
00:58:44,374 --> 00:58:47,741
- He stashed them here somewhere.
- What the hell we gonna do?

559
00:58:47,911 --> 00:58:50,573
- Everybody just go.
- But, T, what about you, man?

560
00:58:51,248 --> 00:58:54,012
I gotta save Vanessa. I gotta find them!

561
00:58:54,184 --> 00:58:56,448
- I'm not leaving you.
- Yes, you are. Now go!

562
00:58:57,087 --> 00:58:59,681
- Right here. Hurry up. Come on.
- Oh, shit.

563
00:58:59,823 --> 00:59:01,848
Come on, dog. They're right outside.

564
00:59:02,025 --> 00:59:04,550
Shut the fuck up and get out of here!

565
00:59:12,503 --> 00:59:14,630
You know, I got the big one.

566
00:59:15,305 --> 00:59:17,466
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

567
00:59:23,547 --> 00:59:25,105
Keep it in your pants.

568
00:59:25,616 --> 00:59:26,981
Who's in there?

569
00:59:41,732 --> 00:59:43,495
You're wrong.

570
00:59:48,672 --> 00:59:50,196
What you want?

571
00:59:51,475 --> 00:59:54,069
- Yeah!
- Move away from him. Come on.

572
00:59:57,714 --> 01:00:03,778
Nice cubic. Yours are real. Not.
I told you this was gonna take a while.

573
01:00:03,954 --> 01:00:07,048
I was thinking about those diamonds
so I made a few calls.

574
01:00:07,191 --> 01:00:10,649
My Defense Department connection
called me back and he tells me...

575
01:00:10,794 --> 01:00:16,699
...about this rumor out of Taiwan about these
black stones. Only they're not jewels.

576
01:00:22,272 --> 01:00:24,706
- Pretty beat up.
- Fell down the stairs.

577
01:00:24,875 --> 01:00:26,206
Enjoy the jail sex, Fait.

578
01:00:31,615 --> 01:00:37,281
Seven advances, 11 's out!
Next up, 8 versus 12!

579
01:00:38,121 --> 01:00:39,452
Eight versus 12!

580
01:00:40,390 --> 01:00:42,620
Fighters report to the cage!

581
01:00:44,261 --> 01:00:45,523
Let's go.

582
01:00:52,636 --> 01:00:54,365
We're still here, T.

583
01:00:54,538 --> 01:00:56,802
Got anything you want us to do?

584
01:00:57,441 --> 01:00:59,932
- Nothing yet.
- What?

585
01:01:00,110 --> 01:01:02,237
Nothing. Nothing.

586
01:01:15,592 --> 01:01:18,425
Unofficial entry number 12!

587
01:01:18,595 --> 01:01:23,430
- Unofficial entry number 12!
- Hey, 12's right here!

588
01:01:23,567 --> 01:01:25,535
Kind of small, ain't he?

589
01:01:28,205 --> 01:01:29,502
Let's go, chickenshit.

590
01:01:29,806 --> 01:01:31,740
You're the chickenshit, buddy!

591
01:01:32,209 --> 01:01:33,904
Not today.

592
01:01:34,411 --> 01:01:37,710
I know this wasn't the plan,
but if you don't get in and fight...

593
01:01:37,881 --> 01:01:40,679
...they'll throw us out
and we'll never find this guy.

594
01:01:41,852 --> 01:01:43,683
- Sorry.
- Just find the ring.

595
01:01:53,430 --> 01:01:56,957
- Hey. Two grand on the white guy.
- You got it, Archie.

596
01:01:57,134 --> 01:01:58,863
Let's go! Come on!

597
01:01:59,069 --> 01:02:00,730
Are you ready? Are you ready?

598
01:02:30,567 --> 01:02:32,262
You win.

599
01:02:32,903 --> 01:02:34,894
- You suck.
- Shit.

600
01:02:35,973 --> 01:02:39,306
No quitting! Get your ass back in there!

601
01:02:48,719 --> 01:02:51,279
Put me down! Goddamn! Come on!

602
01:02:56,126 --> 01:03:01,257
- Put me down or I'll kick your ass, Bruce!
- I'm not Bruce.

603
01:03:12,909 --> 01:03:16,037
Come on. Get up. Get out of here.
Get out of here.

604
01:03:17,347 --> 01:03:18,609
Kick his ass!

605
01:03:18,782 --> 01:03:20,477
Come on! Kick his ass!

606
01:03:22,619 --> 01:03:24,382
Kick him. Take him down.

607
01:03:28,558 --> 01:03:31,356
- Okay. He's all patched up.
- Ready to move.

608
01:03:34,164 --> 01:03:35,461
Let's go.

609
01:03:44,408 --> 01:03:45,807
Get the car. Stay close.

610
01:03:56,253 --> 01:03:59,245
Hey! That guy's got my fucking quad!

611
01:04:00,323 --> 01:04:02,052
I'm gonna get that motherfucker!

612
01:04:14,771 --> 01:04:16,636
Hey! Wait!

613
01:04:43,467 --> 01:04:45,731
Five grand on the Chinaman.
He's my friend.

614
01:04:57,114 --> 01:05:01,073
At this very moment, a man
identified as Anthony Fait is leading...

615
01:05:01,251 --> 01:05:04,709
...police on a wild high-speed chase
through downtown Los Angeles.

616
01:05:04,888 --> 01:05:08,380
And get this, folks.
He's driving an all-terrain vehicle.

617
01:05:51,635 --> 01:05:53,000
Yeah!

618
01:06:13,323 --> 01:06:15,553
Come on! Kick his ass!

619
01:08:18,014 --> 01:08:19,982
Oh, yeah!

620
01:08:23,119 --> 01:08:24,609
Come on. Come on down.

621
01:08:32,796 --> 01:08:34,491
That's the way to get that buck.

622
01:09:07,430 --> 01:09:08,863
- Yo.
- I'm here.

623
01:09:09,032 --> 01:09:11,728
Aboveground parking garage
in Chinatown. Get there.

624
01:09:12,035 --> 01:09:13,662
I know the place.

625
01:09:46,169 --> 01:09:48,399
Hey. Thanks, man.

626
01:09:51,775 --> 01:09:54,403
- Do you like my new ring?
- Where is he?

627
01:09:54,577 --> 01:09:56,408
Well, open the door.

628
01:09:59,149 --> 01:10:00,946
Glad I brought my stunner.

629
01:10:01,117 --> 01:10:04,780
All right, bud. You ready for the q and a?
Where'd you put the stones?

630
01:10:06,322 --> 01:10:09,587
I ain't selling you shit till
I know where the ceiling is.

631
01:10:09,993 --> 01:10:12,621
How much money
do you want for the stones?

632
01:10:12,796 --> 01:10:15,230
- Where's my fucking butter?
- It's almost ready.

633
01:10:18,468 --> 01:10:21,801
See, I hate foreplay. Fucking warm-up.

634
01:10:21,938 --> 01:10:25,430
A bitch gotta be ready to come off
the bench and score some points.

635
01:10:25,608 --> 01:10:30,409
Just take the rock to the motherfucking
hoop strong. You dig?

636
01:10:30,780 --> 01:10:37,208
Instead of doing this back-and-forth shit,
my idea is you come up with a number.

637
01:10:37,387 --> 01:10:41,380
A very high number. You see,
I'm throwing a number so high...

638
01:10:42,225 --> 01:10:47,128
...that when I hear it just...
It just gets me off.

639
01:10:47,297 --> 01:10:52,132
And then, bam! Bust a nut,
roll over, go to sleep.

640
01:10:52,469 --> 01:10:54,300
You like that?

641
01:10:55,338 --> 01:10:56,737
Yeah, I like that.

642
01:11:04,080 --> 01:11:05,980
Oh, shit!

643
01:11:06,549 --> 01:11:08,540
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

644
01:11:08,685 --> 01:11:11,916
Shit! Okay, okay, okay!

645
01:11:12,255 --> 01:11:16,282
And it looks like this parking garage is where
it will end. As police have sealed...

646
01:11:16,459 --> 01:11:19,519
...the building and continue
their search inside for the man who...

647
01:11:19,696 --> 01:11:23,393
...led them on what certainly had to
be the most extreme chase we've ever seen.

648
01:11:23,566 --> 01:11:27,093
- Don't know why these idiots do it, Barbara.
- They never get away, do they?

649
01:11:27,270 --> 01:11:30,728
They sure don't, and they just endanger
innocent citizens in the process.

650
01:11:30,907 --> 01:11:33,637
Here's another car exiting the structure.

651
01:11:33,810 --> 01:11:37,041
Police talking to the driver,
inspecting the vehicle.

652
01:11:37,213 --> 01:11:40,740
Well, the police know they have him
trapped inside the parking structure.

653
01:11:40,917 --> 01:11:44,785
Knowing cops the way I do, I can tell you
they're good and PO'd, excuse my language.

654
01:11:44,954 --> 01:11:48,151
And they're not about to let this guy
slip through their fingers.

655
01:11:52,128 --> 01:11:55,154
Mr. Chambers is resting.
He says not to bother him.

656
01:12:09,913 --> 01:12:11,403
Hey, baby.

657
01:12:12,549 --> 01:12:13,948
Please don't go.

658
01:12:14,117 --> 01:12:16,108
You want me to stay?

659
01:12:16,286 --> 01:12:18,982
Yeah, I need someone to stay here
and help keep me awake.

660
01:12:19,188 --> 01:12:20,382
Wait a minute.

661
01:12:20,557 --> 01:12:22,457
I know that face.

662
01:12:22,659 --> 01:12:26,891
A lot of men had that look on their face
when I got married.

663
01:12:37,574 --> 01:12:39,269
I knew the stones were in there.

664
01:12:39,442 --> 01:12:44,175
He was a tough guy at first, but when I got
close to his nuts he sang like Céline Dion.

665
01:12:45,548 --> 01:12:47,709
How we gonna
get them out of there?

666
01:12:47,884 --> 01:12:49,647
That place is always jumping.

667
01:12:49,886 --> 01:12:51,478
Yo, dog, something's not right.

668
01:12:51,654 --> 01:12:52,848
I got the same feeling.

669
01:12:53,056 --> 01:12:54,489
The doorman.

670
01:12:55,224 --> 01:12:56,213
Where is he?

671
01:12:58,428 --> 01:13:00,259
Everybody stay put.

672
01:13:03,733 --> 01:13:06,702
- Sorry.
- Watch my nuts, all right?

673
01:13:23,353 --> 01:13:25,014
No Chambers' guys.

674
01:13:25,188 --> 01:13:26,815
Something's wrong.

675
01:13:45,541 --> 01:13:47,509
This guy looks better dead.

676
01:13:48,378 --> 01:13:50,642
He said they were here in the fountain.

677
01:13:52,482 --> 01:13:54,074
Where are they?

678
01:13:56,619 --> 01:13:59,588
This can't be fucking happening.
They have to be here!

679
01:14:08,931 --> 01:14:11,491
That's it? One stone?

680
01:14:11,801 --> 01:14:15,100
- Ling. He has the rest.
- How the fuck do you know?

681
01:14:16,172 --> 01:14:17,196
I know.

682
01:14:22,645 --> 01:14:25,978
Okay. He has the stones.

683
01:14:26,416 --> 01:14:29,817
I mean, she can't hurt him.
She's just a little girl.

684
01:14:30,019 --> 01:14:35,286
She's only 8 years old. He'll let her
go, right? He'll just fucking let her go!

685
01:14:42,065 --> 01:14:43,965
What am I gonna do?

686
01:14:45,334 --> 01:14:46,926
We have to go.

687
01:14:55,311 --> 01:14:57,040
Now.

688
01:14:59,649 --> 01:15:02,117
- We're back in business.
- Good.

689
01:15:02,285 --> 01:15:05,618
- We don't have to babysit much longer.
- I hate kids.

690
01:15:05,788 --> 01:15:09,451
- Is everything else ready?
- Just have to test the device.

691
01:15:09,692 --> 01:15:12,024
It's called the Dimaster Oscillator.

692
01:15:12,195 --> 01:15:17,690
Not test. Calibrate.
Which I'm now ready to do.

693
01:15:21,537 --> 01:15:22,526
Goggles?

694
01:15:45,228 --> 01:15:46,752
Here you go, man.

695
01:15:47,363 --> 01:15:48,523
Thanks.

696
01:16:22,365 --> 01:16:24,196
Please work. Please work.

697
01:16:25,034 --> 01:16:26,365
Please work.

698
01:16:37,280 --> 01:16:39,475
Daddy, please. Daddy, please.

699
01:16:42,985 --> 01:16:45,010
Please answer, Daddy, answer.

700
01:16:45,188 --> 01:16:47,053
Want me to get that?

701
01:16:51,661 --> 01:16:53,219
- Yeah?
- Daddy?

702
01:16:53,663 --> 01:16:54,652
Vanessa?

703
01:16:55,097 --> 01:16:56,894
Daddy, please, come and get me...

704
01:16:57,066 --> 01:16:58,499
...I wanna go home!

705
01:16:58,868 --> 01:17:01,894
Calm down, baby. Calm down.
Where are you?

706
01:17:02,171 --> 01:17:03,160
I don't know!

707
01:17:03,339 --> 01:17:05,739
I'm in a van inside a big building.

708
01:17:05,908 --> 01:17:08,035
They painted the windows.
I can't look out!

709
01:17:08,344 --> 01:17:11,336
You gotta help me, sweetheart.
I have to know where you are.

710
01:17:11,514 --> 01:17:13,812
- I'm scared!
- I know you are, honey.

711
01:17:13,983 --> 01:17:17,680
Just try to stay calm. Concentrate.
Look around. What do you see?

712
01:17:18,120 --> 01:17:20,748
I don't know. I can't see anything.

713
01:17:20,923 --> 01:17:23,858
You gotta try, sweetheart.
Try to see something.

714
01:17:25,161 --> 01:17:27,493
I'm going. I'm trying.

715
01:17:33,336 --> 01:17:36,635
I see chairs and green light.

716
01:17:36,806 --> 01:17:38,774
Chairs. Green light.

717
01:17:39,175 --> 01:17:40,642
Where's the light coming from?

718
01:17:40,843 --> 01:17:44,370
I can't tell. There's a machine.
It's like a laser show.

719
01:17:44,680 --> 01:17:46,739
- Laser show?
- Daddy...

720
01:17:46,916 --> 01:17:48,213
...hurry! I'm scared!

721
01:17:48,384 --> 01:17:50,579
- I wanna go home!
- Okay, baby. Calm down.

722
01:17:50,753 --> 01:17:51,742
It's gonna be okay.

723
01:17:51,921 --> 01:17:53,183
Daddy's coming!

724
01:17:56,926 --> 01:17:57,915
Daddy?

725
01:17:58,160 --> 01:17:59,821
- Vanessa?
- Daddy!

726
01:17:59,996 --> 01:18:01,293
Vanessa?

727
01:18:02,965 --> 01:18:03,954
Vanessa!

728
01:18:05,101 --> 01:18:06,363
Great!

729
01:18:06,636 --> 01:18:07,898
Shit!

730
01:18:08,070 --> 01:18:11,631
- He's doing it here tonight.
- Doing what?

731
01:18:11,807 --> 01:18:16,767
Selling the stones. The Thai laser
emits green light. He needs it to enrich them.

732
01:18:16,946 --> 01:18:20,006
- To show their power.
- What the hell are you talking about?

733
01:18:20,149 --> 01:18:21,514
What are these stones?

734
01:18:21,717 --> 01:18:26,245
A new form of synthetic plutonium. Small
and portable, but mega-powerful. Am I right?

735
01:18:26,555 --> 01:18:30,047
There's a bunch of international
scumbags who'd pay a lot of money...

736
01:18:30,192 --> 01:18:33,161
...to get their hands on those.
And then, look out world.

737
01:18:33,329 --> 01:18:34,353
Enough of this shit!

738
01:18:34,664 --> 01:18:37,462
How's it gonna get me
back my daughter?

739
01:18:43,806 --> 01:18:44,830
We're operational.

740
01:18:47,243 --> 01:18:50,701
The buyers will want to arrive
and leave quickly.

741
01:18:50,880 --> 01:18:54,976
Somewhere private,
accessible by aircraft.

742
01:18:55,151 --> 01:18:57,551
Vanessa did say she was inside
of a big building.

743
01:18:57,720 --> 01:18:58,709
Could be a hangar.

744
01:18:58,955 --> 01:19:01,719
There's about a dozen
little airports around here, man.

745
01:19:02,024 --> 01:19:04,151
We ain't gonna never get them all.

746
01:19:04,327 --> 01:19:06,454
- Flight plans.
- Yeah, flight plans.

747
01:19:06,629 --> 01:19:10,087
They gotta list a destination.
Every aircraft that takes off...

748
01:19:10,266 --> 01:19:14,464
...has to file one with the Aviation
Administration or risk getting shot down...

749
01:19:14,603 --> 01:19:17,094
...by the U.S. Military.
So you get that list...

750
01:19:17,239 --> 01:19:19,969
...and maybe we can find out where
the sale's going down.

751
01:19:20,109 --> 01:19:23,977
Daria, call the aviation people.
Use our L.A.P.D. Credentials.

752
01:19:24,113 --> 01:19:27,241
We need flight info on all aircrafts
coming in or going out.

753
01:19:27,383 --> 01:19:30,944
Miles, the no-gun policy
is no longer in effect. Break out the heat.

754
01:19:31,087 --> 01:19:35,319
Everybody else, get ready to move.
Tommy, create a diversion.

755
01:19:35,491 --> 01:19:37,482
I got just the thing if we can fit in it.

756
01:19:51,841 --> 01:19:56,938
Wick Airfield. Five private choppers arriving
tonight within minutes of each other.

757
01:19:57,113 --> 01:20:00,640
- Sounds like our best bet.
- Better be for Vanessa's sake.

758
01:20:01,317 --> 01:20:02,807
Let's go.

759
01:20:06,822 --> 01:20:09,450
You are the world's foremost
arms dealers.

760
01:20:09,625 --> 01:20:14,119
You all know that weaponry equals power,
and in the world of weaponry...

761
01:20:14,296 --> 01:20:15,456
...nukes rule.

762
01:20:16,632 --> 01:20:20,033
But nuclear material is hard to obtain
and difficult to handle.

763
01:20:20,636 --> 01:20:22,831
But what if it weren't?

764
01:20:23,139 --> 01:20:25,699
That's the question that brought
you here tonight.

765
01:20:27,877 --> 01:20:30,846
And this is the answer.

766
01:20:30,980 --> 01:20:35,747
A unique, man-made element.
In its present state it's completely inert.

767
01:20:36,452 --> 01:20:38,181
Zero radiation...

768
01:20:41,590 --> 01:20:43,421
...zero volatility.

769
01:20:43,626 --> 01:20:47,255
One small fragment easily transformed
into a source of immense energy.

770
01:20:48,397 --> 01:20:53,699
More powerful than weapons-grade
plutonium 100 times its size.

771
01:21:01,877 --> 01:21:03,208
Goggles on.

772
01:21:09,118 --> 01:21:11,678
So, what the hell does Taiwan
gotta do with this?

773
01:21:11,821 --> 01:21:14,551
We developed the stones.
They belong to us.

774
01:21:14,723 --> 01:21:18,352
Okay, what about the guy you're after?
How come you know him so well?

775
01:21:18,527 --> 01:21:21,690
We grew up together.
We joined the government at the same time.

776
01:21:21,831 --> 01:21:24,766
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
You were on the same side?

777
01:21:24,934 --> 01:21:28,961
He betrayed us. He killed our team.
He tried to kill me too.

778
01:21:29,138 --> 01:21:32,073
If you don't take this
motherfucker out, I will.

779
01:21:32,241 --> 01:21:35,574
The stones first, then him.

780
01:21:45,454 --> 01:21:48,446
Creating a highly reactive
radioactive isotope...

781
01:21:48,624 --> 01:21:52,025
...requires altering the atomic structure
of the original material.

782
01:21:55,164 --> 01:21:58,395
Normally this is accomplished
by adding neutrons.

783
01:21:58,567 --> 01:22:02,901
Here, we're using electromagnetic distillation
to strip away protons.

784
01:22:03,072 --> 01:22:08,567
In the process, the fragment's potential yield
is increasing exponentially.

785
01:22:14,283 --> 01:22:17,775
We're now reaching the yield level
of a sidewinder missile.

786
01:22:17,953 --> 01:22:20,717
Enough power to take out a tank.

787
01:22:27,830 --> 01:22:32,199
A Tomahawk cruise missile,
enough to destroy a building.

788
01:22:37,573 --> 01:22:38,562
Scud.

789
01:22:39,108 --> 01:22:41,702
That's a few city blocks gone.

790
01:22:48,217 --> 01:22:49,275
Hiroshima.

791
01:22:53,255 --> 01:22:55,314
Two Hiroshimas.

792
01:23:09,338 --> 01:23:11,772
New world order.

793
01:23:26,589 --> 01:23:29,183
The purpose of today's sale
is to begin trading...

794
01:23:29,358 --> 01:23:33,727
...a new commodity on the black market
and to determine its value.

795
01:23:34,096 --> 01:23:36,758
There are 50 stones available
in the first sale.

796
01:23:36,932 --> 01:23:40,561
And the opening bid
is $200,000 per stone.

797
01:23:42,705 --> 01:23:44,138
Bids, please.

798
01:23:44,306 --> 01:23:46,570
I'll bid one million for five stones.

799
01:23:47,109 --> 01:23:51,136
- I'll bid 1.2 million for five stones.
- 1.5 for five stones.

800
01:23:51,313 --> 01:23:53,804
- 1.7 million for five stones.
- 2 million for three.

801
01:23:53,949 --> 01:23:56,144
- 5 million for six stones!
- 5.2 for six!

802
01:23:56,318 --> 01:23:58,252
- 5.7 for six!
- Sold.

803
01:23:58,420 --> 01:24:01,048
- Seven million for 10 stones!
- 8.5 for 10!

804
01:24:03,993 --> 01:24:05,187
Miles, what do you see?

805
01:24:06,729 --> 01:24:08,458
We got five choppers.

806
01:24:11,033 --> 01:24:12,159
Two armed sentries.

807
01:24:13,235 --> 01:24:14,532
Checking the perimeter.

808
01:24:16,272 --> 01:24:18,137
Perimeter is clear.

809
01:24:19,742 --> 01:24:22,302
I'm moving inside.
They're still doing the deal.

810
01:24:26,181 --> 01:24:27,443
There's a camper there.

811
01:24:27,983 --> 01:24:31,111
- And the windows is painted out.
- Vanessa said she was in a van.

812
01:24:31,320 --> 01:24:33,413
Can't see out. It's gotta be it!

813
01:24:33,589 --> 01:24:35,648
Once we get her,
you two disappear fast.

814
01:24:35,791 --> 01:24:36,780
I'll keep her safe.

815
01:24:36,992 --> 01:24:40,325
- 8.7 million for 10 stones!
- 9 million for 10 stones!

816
01:24:40,496 --> 01:24:42,555
- 9.8 for 10.
- 10 million for 10 stones!

817
01:24:42,731 --> 01:24:44,995
- Sold! There are 37 stones.
- 16 million!

818
01:24:45,801 --> 01:24:47,234
Miles! Hit them!

819
01:24:50,839 --> 01:24:54,468
- Done.
- Tommy and Archie, watch the van. Punch it!

820
01:24:56,445 --> 01:24:58,936
- 24.5 for 15!
- 24 and three quarters...

821
01:24:59,114 --> 01:25:00,411
Twenty-five for 15!

822
01:25:07,856 --> 01:25:09,187
Freeze, motherfuckers!

823
01:25:11,293 --> 01:25:12,282
I knew it.

824
01:25:18,834 --> 01:25:21,428
You heard the man. Party's over!

825
01:25:21,603 --> 01:25:23,571
- I knew it.
- Just be cool.

826
01:25:24,073 --> 01:25:25,734
Fucking amateurs.

827
01:25:27,476 --> 01:25:29,706
Come on, man, just be cool!

828
01:25:30,913 --> 01:25:32,813
I said, don't move, motherfucker!

829
01:25:43,258 --> 01:25:45,317
She's out! She's out!
She's on the move.

830
01:25:47,429 --> 01:25:48,896
Another time.

831
01:25:58,374 --> 01:26:01,537
- There's a guy after her.
- Stay right here. I'll go get her.

832
01:26:03,979 --> 01:26:05,742
- Holy shit!
- Come to Papa!

833
01:26:11,587 --> 01:26:13,646
Shit! That motherfucker's shooting!

834
01:26:15,758 --> 01:26:17,453
- What do we do?
- Shoot him!

835
01:26:17,593 --> 01:26:19,083
Easy for you to say!

836
01:26:41,950 --> 01:26:42,939
You do him.

837
01:27:07,209 --> 01:27:08,642
Don't let him get away!

838
01:27:08,811 --> 01:27:11,245
Oh, shit! Shit! Archie, I'm out of ammo!

839
01:27:11,413 --> 01:27:13,779
- Fire the M-60!
- Get me closer!

840
01:27:15,517 --> 01:27:16,506
Give me that!

841
01:27:41,143 --> 01:27:43,543
How many times do we have to kill you?

842
01:27:54,323 --> 01:27:55,551
Get him! I got this.

843
01:28:04,199 --> 01:28:05,598
Go! Go!

844
01:28:10,339 --> 01:28:11,897
- Go!
- All right!

845
01:28:44,206 --> 01:28:45,867
- What happened?
- I don't know!

846
01:28:46,074 --> 01:28:47,098
We're out of balance!

847
01:28:55,250 --> 01:28:58,742
Retract the landing gear! Do it!
Do it now!

848
01:29:00,756 --> 01:29:02,121
Shoot him down!

849
01:29:02,291 --> 01:29:03,952
Shit! I'm out of ammo! What now?

850
01:29:04,126 --> 01:29:05,218
Shoot him down!

851
01:29:05,394 --> 01:29:06,884
- Load the cannon.
- How?

852
01:29:07,062 --> 01:29:10,463
- Put the giant bullet into the hole!
- Oh, shit.

853
01:29:10,666 --> 01:29:11,655
Oh, shit!

854
01:29:20,309 --> 01:29:23,836
- There he is! There he is! I got him!
- Archie, shoot this motherfucker!

855
01:29:28,383 --> 01:29:29,372
We're hit!

856
01:29:31,420 --> 01:29:34,184
- Hey! Hey!
- You shot him in the ass!

857
01:29:34,356 --> 01:29:35,516
We got it!

858
01:30:13,495 --> 01:30:14,484
Shit!

859
01:30:15,764 --> 01:30:18,198
Time to end this my way.

860
01:30:20,435 --> 01:30:22,460
- Let her go!
- Let go! Daddy!

861
01:30:22,671 --> 01:30:23,968
Daddy!

862
01:30:24,172 --> 01:30:25,161
Daddy!

863
01:30:34,850 --> 01:30:36,408
Damn! No shot.

864
01:30:40,522 --> 01:30:42,114
You were lucky last time.

865
01:30:44,660 --> 01:30:46,890
You won't be lucky again.

866
01:31:23,999 --> 01:31:25,227
Daddy!

867
01:33:07,202 --> 01:33:08,567
Come on, baby. Come on.

868
01:33:34,229 --> 01:33:35,457
Wrong kid!

869
01:33:37,599 --> 01:33:39,692
Definitely the wrong father!

870
01:34:31,386 --> 01:34:34,617
- My baby!
- Daddy, I knew you'd find me!

871
01:34:34,789 --> 01:34:36,654
So glad the angels kept you safe.

872
01:34:42,030 --> 01:34:43,327
Another one?

873
01:34:43,865 --> 01:34:45,025
You know it.

874
01:34:50,572 --> 01:34:54,372
Never gonna let you go. Ever.

875
01:35:13,028 --> 01:35:15,326
Guess we both got what we wanted.

876
01:35:17,432 --> 01:35:19,764
So, what happens to the stones now?

877
01:35:20,068 --> 01:35:22,229
They'll be destroyed.

878
01:35:26,474 --> 01:35:28,499
Guess I'll be spending some time in jail.

879
01:35:29,210 --> 01:35:30,199
Jail?

880
01:35:30,712 --> 01:35:34,842
Come on, man. He just saved the planet,
man. Can't he at least get probation?

881
01:35:35,050 --> 01:35:36,210
I'll do what I can.

882
01:35:36,418 --> 01:35:37,578
- Thanks.
- That's great.

883
01:35:37,752 --> 01:35:40,915
Because we make a hell of a team,
am I right? Except for you.

884
01:35:41,056 --> 01:35:43,752
You're law enforcement.
But we gotta stick together.

885
01:35:43,892 --> 01:35:46,087
And a white guy comes in handy.

886
01:35:46,227 --> 01:35:50,061
You wanna rip off a country club,
or somebody needs to hail a cab. Right?

887
01:35:50,198 --> 01:35:52,462
- So, what percentage are we talking?
- None.

888
01:35:52,634 --> 01:35:54,363
That low, huh?

889
01:35:56,438 --> 01:35:58,804
It's about time I got my shit together.

890
01:35:59,674 --> 01:36:02,404
- About time we all did.
- I'm with you, T.

891
01:36:03,445 --> 01:36:06,175
Come on, buddy, it's just getting fun.

892
01:36:06,514 --> 01:36:09,347
Well, I mean, you know,
it's not that fun...

893
01:36:13,555 --> 01:36:15,750
- Good luck.
- Thank you.

894
01:36:18,059 --> 01:36:19,151
Faith.

895
01:36:19,394 --> 01:36:20,383
Faith.

896
01:36:21,563 --> 01:36:22,894
Faith.

897
01:36:23,064 --> 01:36:24,497
Faith.

898
01:36:24,899 --> 01:36:26,196
Faith.

899
01:37:31,032 --> 01:37:33,523
So you guys are all just gonna
up and go straight?

900
01:37:33,701 --> 01:37:35,931
Yeah. You ought to try it yourself, man.

901
01:37:36,104 --> 01:37:38,595
I could do it. I've had straight jobs.
Have you?

902
01:37:38,740 --> 01:37:41,641
- I've had plenty of straight jobs.
- Really? Name one.

903
01:37:42,811 --> 01:37:44,369
I sold Avon.

904
01:37:44,646 --> 01:37:48,104
- You were an Avon lady?
- I was an Avon man. All right?

905
01:37:48,283 --> 01:37:50,547
- You got a problem with that?
- No, it's fair.

906
01:37:50,718 --> 01:37:53,846
- Why you looking at me like that?
- I'm not! I'm not! It's okay.

907
01:37:55,490 --> 01:38:00,450
I'm just fucking with you. But my mama
sold Avon. And don't be disrespecting her.

908
01:38:00,595 --> 01:38:03,291
- I know her. Remember the party?
- She whipped your ass.

909
01:38:03,431 --> 01:38:04,989
No, she sucker-punched me.

910
01:38:05,133 --> 01:38:08,296
That ain't the first time you
been sucker-punched by a big woman.

911
01:38:08,436 --> 01:38:10,996
You know, I think
I got kind of a fetish.

912
01:38:11,206 --> 01:38:13,697
Did you just say my mama had a fat ass?

913
01:38:13,875 --> 01:38:17,675
No, I said I have a kind
of a fetish for big women.

914
01:38:17,846 --> 01:38:21,043
- Oh. But she do got a fat ass though.
- Yeah, she does have a fat ass.

915
01:38:21,216 --> 01:38:23,741
You can see it when she's sitting
on your head.

916
01:38:23,918 --> 01:38:27,547
I've seen it. I had to rub that ass
naked when I was a teenager.

917
01:38:27,689 --> 01:38:30,954
You know, you look a lot like her.
Except her hair is different.

918
01:38:31,126 --> 01:38:34,823
Yeah. I shave my beard,
she keeps hers growing.

919
01:38:34,996 --> 01:38:37,055
- Yeah. You know what?
- What?

920
01:38:37,232 --> 01:38:42,135
I'm gonna write a movie about all the shit we
got through. I've been taking notes.

921
01:38:42,270 --> 01:38:45,364
It's gonna make a lot of money.
I'm calling it Sidekicks.

922
01:38:45,507 --> 01:38:48,999
We're the real stars of this.
We shot down the damn helicopter.

923
01:38:49,177 --> 01:38:51,509
- Who's playing you?
- I've been thinking about that.

924
01:38:51,679 --> 01:38:55,012
First I thought Arnold Schwarzenegger,
then I saw him at the gas station...

925
01:38:55,150 --> 01:38:56,515
- Midget.
- He's like 5'6".

926
01:38:56,684 --> 01:38:58,549
- Midget.
- Got a terrible lisp.

927
01:38:58,720 --> 01:39:01,245
So I'll go with Mel Gibson.
We have similar features.

928
01:39:01,422 --> 01:39:03,151
Right. I see the forehead.

929
01:39:03,324 --> 01:39:05,588
- Yeah. And you? Guess.
- Denzel!

930
01:39:05,760 --> 01:39:06,852
Denzel!

931
01:39:07,028 --> 01:39:10,429
- You noticed I've been cutting it down.
- And he's been beefing up.

932
01:39:10,598 --> 01:39:15,331
- I'm trying to get it down to Denzel's weight.
- You know who will be your girlfriend? Oprah.

933
01:39:15,503 --> 01:39:17,494
- Big Oprah or little Oprah?
- Medium Oprah.

934
01:39:17,672 --> 01:39:19,867
That's the one I like
because the eyes are straight.

935
01:39:20,008 --> 01:39:22,101
- This is about reality.
- Right. Realism.

936
01:39:22,277 --> 01:39:24,472
- Yeah. So you know who's my girlfriend?
- Who?

937
01:39:24,646 --> 01:39:28,480
Halle Berry. And let me tell you why.
It'll add a whole different element.

938
01:39:28,616 --> 01:39:32,211
This is gonna be an interracial couple.
She's never done that before.

939
01:39:32,353 --> 01:39:36,449
Also, Fait. I've been thinking about
that a lot. I'll go with Shaquille O'Neal.

940
01:39:36,624 --> 01:39:39,923
The most dominating player ever in the NBA.
You saw Kazaam.

941
01:39:40,094 --> 01:39:42,255
- Right
- It wasn't the right material.

942
01:39:42,397 --> 01:39:46,128
He's gonna kill with this stuff.
And Su, I've been thinking about him.

943
01:39:46,301 --> 01:39:48,963
- Remember the movie Sixteen Candles?
- Yeah.

944
01:39:49,137 --> 01:39:51,503
- Who am I thinking about?
- Molly Ringwald?

945
01:39:51,673 --> 01:39:53,664
- No, the Donger!
- Oh! Okay!

946
01:39:53,841 --> 01:39:56,401
How funny was that guy?
What happened to him?

947
01:39:56,578 --> 01:39:58,910
- He waiting tables someplace.
- He was funny!

948
01:39:59,080 --> 01:40:03,141
- Yeah, he was. Hey, Daria.
- Daria? Who you got?

949
01:40:03,318 --> 01:40:06,082
- Winona Ryder.
- Yeah, she's good. She'd be good.

950
01:40:06,254 --> 01:40:08,484
- Yeah, she's good.
- She'd play a thief.

951
01:40:08,656 --> 01:40:11,887
She'd play a thief. She a good actress.
The whole elbow thing.

952
01:40:12,060 --> 01:40:15,518
Remember when she's going to court
and hit the one elbow, broke that elbow.

953
01:40:15,697 --> 01:40:19,531
- Electricity went through her body.
- She's a ventriloquist with the elbows.

954
01:40:19,701 --> 01:40:21,931
Now who do we get to direct this thing?

955
01:40:22,604 --> 01:40:23,696
You know what?

956
01:40:23,938 --> 01:40:28,204
We should get the same dude that directed
Romeo Must Die and Exit Wounds.

957
01:40:28,376 --> 01:40:30,936
- The director, the Pole, Polack.
- The Polack?

958
01:40:31,112 --> 01:40:33,876
Yeah, we'll get him in there.
Exit Wounds, did you see that?

959
01:40:34,048 --> 01:40:35,606
- I saw that.
- The best part...

960
01:40:35,783 --> 01:40:36,909
- The end.
- The very end.

961
01:40:37,051 --> 01:40:41,181
- Over the credits. The rest sucked.
- You can't have the movie without the end.

962
01:40:41,322 --> 01:40:44,416
- There's no movie.
- Whatever happened with those two guys?

963
01:40:44,592 --> 01:40:45,786
I heard they're gay.

964
01:40:47,061 --> 01:40:49,325
Yeah, of course. Hollywood.
