1
00:01:09,069 --> 00:01:13,733
<i>Sharkboy was not always</i>
<i>half shark, half boy. </i>

2
00:01:13,807 --> 00:01:18,176
<i>He was a marine biologist -</i>
<i>or, at least, in training. </i>

3
00:01:18,244 --> 00:01:20,735
<i>His father studied great white sharks</i>

4
00:01:20,814 --> 00:01:26,252
<i>and called his son "Sharkboy" because of</i>
<i>how much he loved to care for the sharks. </i>

5
00:01:26,319 --> 00:01:30,153
<i>He made them sushi</i>
<i>and had given them all names:</i>

6
00:01:30,223 --> 00:01:33,954
<i>Goodmilk, Peggy, Eggbat... </i>

7
00:01:34,761 --> 00:01:36,786
<i>and Crackett. </i>

8
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:45,269
<i>But one day</i>
<i>an incredible, mysterious storm appeared. </i>

9
00:01:45,805 --> 00:01:48,239
<i>It swept away the entire laboratory. </i>

10
00:01:48,308 --> 00:01:49,434
Sharkboy!

11
00:01:49,509 --> 00:01:53,570
<i>Thanks to their life rafts,</i>
<i>Sharkboy and his father survived. </i>

12
00:01:53,646 --> 00:01:56,547
<i>But they survived</i>
<i>on different sides of the wreckage,</i>

13
00:01:56,616 --> 00:01:58,880
<i>each floating off in a different direction. </i>

14
00:01:58,952 --> 00:02:00,283
Sharkboy!

15
00:02:00,353 --> 00:02:03,652
<i>Sharkboy was completely alone. </i>

16
00:02:05,992 --> 00:02:08,483
<i>Almost completely. </i>

17
00:02:09,129 --> 00:02:12,462
<i>But one of the sharks recognized him. </i>

18
00:02:12,532 --> 00:02:14,329
Hey, it's Sharkboy.

19
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:18,097
Don't take a bite outta him, boys -
he's a friend.

20
00:02:18,805 --> 00:02:24,710
<i>They took Sharkboy to their cave home,</i>
<i>where he'd be safe and dry. </i>

21
00:02:27,847 --> 00:02:30,714
<i>His new family were sharks. </i>

22
00:02:33,586 --> 00:02:36,521
<i>Hundreds of sharks. </i>

23
00:02:41,394 --> 00:02:44,124
<i>The sharks raised him</i>
<i>as one of their own,</i>

24
00:02:44,197 --> 00:02:47,030
<i>training him in the ways of the shark. </i>

25
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:49,762
You must keep moving to survive.

26
00:02:49,836 --> 00:02:52,669
Always go forward, never back.

27
00:02:53,673 --> 00:02:57,234
<i>To live by instinct and instinct alone. </i>

28
00:03:01,314 --> 00:03:06,183
<i>Eventually he grew gills,</i>
<i>and sharp talons for claws. </i>

29
00:03:06,252 --> 00:03:08,914
<i>His teeth sharpened themselves</i>
<i>to a point. </i>

30
00:03:08,988 --> 00:03:14,016
<i>He grew fins - all sorts of fins. </i>

31
00:03:14,093 --> 00:03:16,288
<i>But that was years ago. </i>

32
00:03:16,362 --> 00:03:20,958
<i>I first met Sharkboy</i>
<i>while fishing on the dock this summer. </i>

33
00:03:31,277 --> 00:03:33,677
<i>He seemed lost. </i>

34
00:03:33,746 --> 00:03:36,476
- You have to get a job!
- No, I have a job!

35
00:03:36,549 --> 00:03:39,518
<i>So I snuck him home... </i>

36
00:03:39,586 --> 00:03:41,850
Then maybe you should just leave.

37
00:03:41,921 --> 00:03:44,913
<i>... when my parents</i>
<i>were too busy to notice. </i>

38
00:03:47,227 --> 00:03:50,458
<i>I kept him fed and in water. </i>

39
00:03:51,331 --> 00:03:55,791
<i>He had been traveling the universe</i>
<i>in search of his father. </i>

40
00:03:55,868 --> 00:04:02,068
<i>He told me of his latest adventures</i>
<i>on a planet so cool it makes you drool. </i>

41
00:04:02,675 --> 00:04:06,873
<i>He said I too</i>
<i>could go to Planet Drool someday. </i>

42
00:04:07,847 --> 00:04:11,943
<i>Then one night</i>
<i>I was visited by a glowing light. </i>

43
00:04:12,018 --> 00:04:17,581
<i>An amazing girl with purple flames for hair</i>
<i>and skin of molten lava rock appeared. </i>

44
00:04:17,657 --> 00:04:19,147
<i>I called her... </i>

45
00:04:19,225 --> 00:04:21,193
Lavagirl.

46
00:04:21,261 --> 00:04:24,788
<i>She smiled at me,</i>
<i>for that seemed to be her name. </i>

47
00:04:24,864 --> 00:04:28,960
<i>She told me she needed Sharkboy</i>
<i>to return to Planet Drool with her,</i>

48
00:04:29,035 --> 00:04:31,663
<i>for a great crisis was developing. </i>

49
00:04:31,738 --> 00:04:37,005
<i>She asked if I could go with them. </i>
<i>I told her, "I have school tomorrow. "</i>

50
00:04:37,076 --> 00:04:40,876
<i>She gave me a sad look</i>
<i>and flamed away,</i>

51
00:04:40,947 --> 00:04:43,415
<i>taking Sharkboy with her. </i>

52
00:04:44,684 --> 00:04:48,780
<i>I haven't seen Sharkboy</i>
<i>or Lavagirl since then. </i>

53
00:04:50,456 --> 00:04:53,448
And that's what I did this summer.

54
00:04:57,397 --> 00:04:59,092
Enough!

55
00:04:59,198 --> 00:05:03,965
Someone is picking that up.
And it's not gonna be me!

56
00:05:04,937 --> 00:05:08,429
We were supposed to tell true stories.

57
00:05:08,508 --> 00:05:10,476
That <i>is</i> a true story.

58
00:05:10,543 --> 00:05:15,537
- Does Lavagirl have special powers?
- There's no such thing as Lavagirl.

59
00:05:16,015 --> 00:05:18,245
She can...

60
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:23,751
She can shoot lava out of her hands.

61
00:05:23,823 --> 00:05:25,085
Cool.

62
00:05:25,158 --> 00:05:27,888
How many people think
Max's story is true?

63
00:05:28,494 --> 00:05:30,655
- Not true.
- Made up.

64
00:05:30,730 --> 00:05:33,597
- Not true.
- It's just a made-up story.

65
00:05:34,867 --> 00:05:38,894
If it's true, why don't you bring
Sharkboy and Lavagirl to class tomorrow?

66
00:05:38,971 --> 00:05:41,565
They went away.
I don't know where they went.

67
00:05:41,641 --> 00:05:43,131
Have a seat, Max.

68
00:05:43,209 --> 00:05:45,541
Linus, you're next.

69
00:05:52,118 --> 00:05:57,146
This summer, I met a new friend...
who was half dork, half boy.

70
00:05:57,223 --> 00:05:59,384
I called him Dorkboy.

71
00:06:00,326 --> 00:06:02,089
But his real name was Max.

72
00:06:02,161 --> 00:06:07,997
We had him for dinner, but he stunk
so bad that we all blew chunks.

73
00:06:09,535 --> 00:06:12,231
That's enough, Linus.

74
00:06:12,305 --> 00:06:15,763
Linus, Max, stay.

75
00:06:15,842 --> 00:06:17,537
Come on, Mr. E!

76
00:06:17,610 --> 00:06:19,805
Class, what's my name?

77
00:06:19,879 --> 00:06:23,076
Mr. Electricidad.

78
00:06:23,149 --> 00:06:25,743
Mr. Electricidad, exactly.

79
00:06:25,818 --> 00:06:30,949
Not Mr. Electric,
not Mr. Electrici-tha-tha-tha-tha.

80
00:06:32,125 --> 00:06:36,459
Linus, you just earned a minus
for your behavior today.

81
00:06:36,529 --> 00:06:40,761
This is a new year.
Do you think you can be friends?

82
00:06:40,833 --> 00:06:42,095
No.

83
00:06:42,168 --> 00:06:45,262
Then it's been decided:
You'll be the best of friends.

84
00:06:45,338 --> 00:06:49,206
Which means
no more picking on Max, Linus.

85
00:06:50,610 --> 00:06:52,237
Max.

86
00:06:52,311 --> 00:06:56,077
You're in the fourth grade.
There are some good kids in this class.

87
00:06:56,149 --> 00:06:59,585
Find them. Make friends with them.

88
00:06:59,652 --> 00:07:04,589
Dreaming keeps you from seeing
what's right here in front of you.

89
00:07:04,657 --> 00:07:08,855
This isn't a dream.
This is the real world.

90
00:07:12,598 --> 00:07:14,828
Lost my train of thought.

91
00:07:14,901 --> 00:07:17,062
No dreaming. Got it.

92
00:07:17,136 --> 00:07:19,001
I'll try harder.

93
00:07:19,071 --> 00:07:21,232
What do you have there?

94
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:25,975
It's my dream journal.

95
00:07:26,045 --> 00:07:29,208
It has all of my most precious dreams in it.

96
00:07:29,282 --> 00:07:32,911
I'll never part with it
for as long as I live.

97
00:07:34,086 --> 00:07:36,486
You're a good kid, Max.

98
00:07:43,930 --> 00:07:45,864
Max!

99
00:07:45,932 --> 00:07:48,958
Let's be <i>imaginary</i> friends.

100
00:07:49,035 --> 00:07:53,495
You can try and hang with us...
and we'll pretend you don't exist!

101
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:58,201
Check it out.
Sharkboy gets shocked by electric eels,

102
00:07:58,277 --> 00:08:01,405
and then they feed on his cooked flesh.

103
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:03,346
Wow, Linus.

104
00:08:03,950 --> 00:08:06,783
Your skills are... weak.

105
00:08:12,024 --> 00:08:14,049
Ohh...

106
00:08:16,496 --> 00:08:19,329
I'm gonna burst your bubble, Dream Boy.

107
00:08:23,135 --> 00:08:25,035
You're dead!

108
00:08:25,104 --> 00:08:27,231
Get the book!

109
00:08:38,484 --> 00:08:40,418
Give me the book.

110
00:08:40,486 --> 00:08:44,479
Hand over the book,
or you'll visit the dream world!

111
00:09:01,707 --> 00:09:03,607
Ooh...

112
00:09:05,177 --> 00:09:06,940
Agh-haa...

113
00:09:07,013 --> 00:09:09,174
All right! Got it!

114
00:09:11,951 --> 00:09:15,580
I'll bring you a revised edition tomorrow.

115
00:09:32,305 --> 00:09:35,570
<i>- Max, wake up!</i>
<i>- Dream, Max. </i>

116
00:09:35,641 --> 00:09:40,806
<i>- Open your eyes, Max. </i>
<i>- Eyes open, and dream. Stay dreaming. </i>

117
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:42,814
<i>Wake up!</i>

118
00:10:17,984 --> 00:10:20,043
Sharkboy!

119
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:23,612
And Lavagirl!

120
00:10:28,327 --> 00:10:29,851
Hyah!

121
00:10:30,696 --> 00:10:32,425
Max!

122
00:10:32,498 --> 00:10:34,966
My cookies! My giant cookies!

123
00:10:35,034 --> 00:10:39,494
What are you doing baking sweets? You
know what happens when he eats sugar.

124
00:10:39,572 --> 00:10:41,631
I baked them for his class.

125
00:10:41,707 --> 00:10:45,108
So you could make friends at school,
and now you've eaten all of them.

126
00:10:45,177 --> 00:10:47,042
No, it was Sharkboy and Lavagirl!

127
00:10:47,113 --> 00:10:51,675
Look - this one has shark bites,
and this one is singed.

128
00:10:51,751 --> 00:10:54,618
There's no such thing
as Sharkboy and Lavagirl.

129
00:10:54,687 --> 00:10:57,155
Well, I believe him.

130
00:10:57,223 --> 00:11:02,126
Your mother's right. When you go to sleep
and close your eyes, they may come back.

131
00:11:02,228 --> 00:11:07,029
But when you open 'em again, Sharkgirl
and Lavaboy'll be... outta here.

132
00:11:07,066 --> 00:11:10,263
- But...
- Shh. Mouth closed, eyes closed.

133
00:11:10,336 --> 00:11:12,827
- Now?
- Yes, now.

134
00:11:17,209 --> 00:11:21,373
You can wait till you're in bed
to close your eyes, Max.

135
00:11:23,282 --> 00:11:25,682
Kids need their dreams.

136
00:11:26,452 --> 00:11:29,979
Kids... need to grow up!

137
00:11:35,928 --> 00:11:39,625
He's not making any friends
with <i>these</i> cookies!

138
00:11:42,368 --> 00:11:45,895
There's no such thing
as Sharkboy and Lavagirl.

139
00:11:46,072 --> 00:11:49,530
There's no such thing
as Sharkboy and Lavagirl.

140
00:11:50,209 --> 00:11:52,234
Yes, there is.

141
00:11:53,345 --> 00:11:55,472
Stupid plugs!

142
00:11:56,215 --> 00:12:02,381
Please don't let me have to go to school.
They'll make fun of me, I know it!

143
00:12:02,455 --> 00:12:07,722
I wish I could just escape this loser world
and go to Planet Drool.

144
00:12:07,793 --> 00:12:11,126
Games and toys and laughs and fun...

145
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:21,538
May there be terrible storms,
rain, sleet, snow, tornadoes...

146
00:12:22,775 --> 00:12:28,645
so I can lay here all day tomorrow
and dream of Drool.

147
00:12:54,774 --> 00:12:57,436
Guess I didn't dream hard enough.

148
00:12:57,977 --> 00:13:01,413
There are plenty of good opportunities.
You just need to look.

149
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:03,948
Ooh, traffic engineer!

150
00:13:07,286 --> 00:13:08,514
Hey.

151
00:13:08,587 --> 00:13:11,385
I was cleaning out my closet
and look what I found.

152
00:13:11,457 --> 00:13:14,449
Remember Tobor?
The robot you tried to build?

153
00:13:14,527 --> 00:13:17,155
Why were you cleaning out your closet?

154
00:13:17,229 --> 00:13:19,459
I had to find one of these.

155
00:13:19,532 --> 00:13:23,468
- Is Mom making you get a real job again?
- Writing <i>is</i> a real job.

156
00:13:25,571 --> 00:13:28,563
- When it pays.
- Max, I'm walking you to school today.

157
00:13:28,641 --> 00:13:32,509
So what do you say?
Wanna finish making Tobor?

158
00:13:33,179 --> 00:13:34,703
It won't work.

159
00:13:34,780 --> 00:13:39,046
- Well, how do you know?
- 'Cause you told me it wouldn't.

160
00:13:40,152 --> 00:13:42,177
I did?

161
00:13:44,223 --> 00:13:48,683
I'm sorry.
I should've never said that.

162
00:13:48,761 --> 00:13:51,389
It's OK. You were right.

163
00:13:52,865 --> 00:13:54,958
Dumb idea.

164
00:13:57,636 --> 00:14:00,264
How did these happen?

165
00:14:00,339 --> 00:14:02,807
The grass was dead anyway.

166
00:14:02,875 --> 00:14:05,173
Why are you so morbid?

167
00:14:05,244 --> 00:14:09,840
I just wish anything could happen
so I wouldn't have to go to school today.

168
00:14:09,915 --> 00:14:12,315
That's not realistic, Max.

169
00:14:12,384 --> 00:14:16,514
It's bad enough your father's head
is in the clouds, but not you too, OK?

170
00:14:16,589 --> 00:14:20,252
Just push that dream aside and move on.

171
00:14:20,326 --> 00:14:25,559
Like with your dream?
The one about you and Dad and me?

172
00:14:25,631 --> 00:14:27,758
Well, I do have a dream about us,

173
00:14:27,833 --> 00:14:32,202
but, as I'm sure you've been noticing lately,
your father and I are just...

174
00:14:32,271 --> 00:14:36,037
Well, we're... not compatible.

175
00:14:36,108 --> 00:14:41,444
Sorry. I don't mean to dump all this on you
right before you have to go to school, but...

176
00:14:41,513 --> 00:14:43,344
school's waiting.

177
00:14:43,415 --> 00:14:45,747
Did we have to move so close to school?

178
00:14:45,818 --> 00:14:48,719
Your father thought
we'd save money on gas.

179
00:14:48,787 --> 00:14:54,191
Come right home after school today, 'cause
there's some things we need to talk about.

180
00:14:54,260 --> 00:14:56,160
I love you.

181
00:14:57,863 --> 00:15:02,061
I wish anything could happen
so I wouldn't have to come home today.

182
00:15:04,536 --> 00:15:07,130
Hey, look, it's Dream Boy!

183
00:15:12,645 --> 00:15:15,876
Who knows where tornadoes come from?

184
00:15:16,615 --> 00:15:21,518
Well, when cold air mixes with hot air,
it can form a tornado,

185
00:15:21,587 --> 00:15:25,353
as the hot and cold chase each other
around and around and around.

186
00:15:25,424 --> 00:15:30,418
I dreamt of a story kind of like Sharkboy
and Lavagirl - Ice Girl and Dream Boy.

187
00:15:30,496 --> 00:15:34,159
Her powers come from her crystal heart.

188
00:15:34,967 --> 00:15:36,559
No more fairy tales.

189
00:15:36,635 --> 00:15:39,035
Piranha Girl and Beluga Boy.

190
00:15:39,104 --> 00:15:41,629
Plastic Boy and Metal Girl.

191
00:15:41,707 --> 00:15:43,641
Barf Boy and Vomit Girl.

192
00:15:43,709 --> 00:15:46,872
Does everyone hear me?
I'm a teacher, right?

193
00:15:46,946 --> 00:15:49,437
Wrong. I'm an awakener.

194
00:15:49,515 --> 00:15:54,214
Only I'm finding it more and more difficult
to keep my class... awake.

195
00:15:55,020 --> 00:15:57,853
No recess again for you, Marissa -
too many allergies.

196
00:15:57,923 --> 00:16:00,756
There are more boogers on your work
than there is work.

197
00:16:00,826 --> 00:16:03,488
I'm just cold.

198
00:16:03,562 --> 00:16:08,124
I'll be happy to change places with you.
It's a lot warmer back there in my spot.

199
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:10,600
But I... have to sit up front.

200
00:16:10,669 --> 00:16:14,070
It's just that you're sitting
right under the vent.

201
00:16:14,139 --> 00:16:17,973
- It's August and you're sneezing.
- You're gonna get me in trouble.

202
00:16:18,043 --> 00:16:20,034
Max.

203
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:24,340
Are you... trying to make real friends?

204
00:16:24,416 --> 00:16:26,646
Trying, like you told me to.

205
00:16:26,719 --> 00:16:30,485
That's good.
Just not with my daughter, OK?

206
00:16:32,758 --> 00:16:35,659
No! It wasn't like that. It's just...

207
00:16:35,728 --> 00:16:37,958
Sit down, Max.

208
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:51,241
- Give me back my journal!
- Class has begun. Everyone in your seats.

209
00:16:51,310 --> 00:16:54,507
- Linus took my journal!
- I did not!

210
00:16:54,580 --> 00:16:57,378
Minus! I mean, Linus.

211
00:16:57,449 --> 00:17:02,079
You get a minus for misconduct.
Give Max back his journal.

212
00:17:03,255 --> 00:17:06,850
One more time, Linus, and we'll have to
change your name to Minus.

213
00:17:14,833 --> 00:17:17,199
He ruined my dream journal!

214
00:17:17,269 --> 00:17:20,534
I did not! Mr. Electric,
send him to the principal's office

215
00:17:20,606 --> 00:17:23,074
and have him expelled!

216
00:17:23,142 --> 00:17:26,407
You're in my class,
not the other way around!

217
00:17:26,478 --> 00:17:30,380
I know everything
and you know nothing!

218
00:17:30,449 --> 00:17:35,250
At the end of class,
both of you report to the principal's office!

219
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:36,947
With your parents!

220
00:18:00,045 --> 00:18:01,945
Everybody down!

221
00:18:15,661 --> 00:18:17,629
It's them!

222
00:18:27,706 --> 00:18:30,072
I'm looking for Max.

223
00:18:39,751 --> 00:18:41,651
She's hot!

224
00:18:45,190 --> 00:18:46,748
Whoa!

225
00:18:47,259 --> 00:18:50,456
We need your help, Max.
Come with us.

226
00:18:52,564 --> 00:18:54,429
What do I have to do?

227
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:57,264
Go with us to Planet Drool.
We'll explain on the way.

228
00:18:57,336 --> 00:18:59,099
We're going to Planet Drool?

229
00:19:04,376 --> 00:19:07,504
It's my home planet.
Just outside our solar system.

230
00:19:07,579 --> 00:19:10,912
You should know, Max - you made it up.

231
00:19:14,486 --> 00:19:16,681
- I can't go with you.
- Why not?

232
00:19:16,755 --> 00:19:21,215
Because you're not real.
Both of you are just a dream.

233
00:19:22,494 --> 00:19:26,487
And when I open my eyes, you'll be gone.

234
00:19:32,171 --> 00:19:34,366
We're still here, Max.

235
00:19:34,439 --> 00:19:40,309
If you wanna stop the darkness
from destroying our worlds, come with us.

236
00:19:41,046 --> 00:19:43,139
You better go with them.

237
00:19:45,450 --> 00:19:48,078
OK... I'll go.

238
00:19:52,157 --> 00:19:55,354
Everyone follow me
and we'll find shelter.

239
00:19:55,427 --> 00:20:00,421
I can't believe I'm finally getting
to ditch this place and go to Planet Drool!

240
00:20:00,499 --> 00:20:02,399
How are we getting there?

241
00:20:14,112 --> 00:20:16,307
Put these on, everybody.

242
00:20:16,381 --> 00:20:20,340
Blue goggles for the boys,
pink for the girls.

243
00:20:20,419 --> 00:20:23,115
Do you have another pair of boy goggles?

244
00:20:23,722 --> 00:20:25,280
Uh-uh.

245
00:20:28,327 --> 00:20:30,921
So, how do you fly it?

246
00:20:30,996 --> 00:20:33,487
- You don't know?
- Duh!

247
00:20:33,565 --> 00:20:35,965
That's sort of been the whole problem!

248
00:20:37,369 --> 00:20:39,394
You press go.

249
00:20:57,689 --> 00:21:02,217
- Now, how do you fly it?
- It's got an autopilot.

250
00:21:02,294 --> 00:21:04,990
You just thought of everything,
didn't you, Max?

251
00:21:05,063 --> 00:21:07,190
Not exactly.

252
00:21:07,266 --> 00:21:12,670
- How do we land it?
- That's the part I never thought of!

253
00:21:13,105 --> 00:21:16,302
Jupiter... Saturn... Neptune...

254
00:21:16,775 --> 00:21:19,710
You might wanna hold on to something.

255
00:21:40,832 --> 00:21:43,300
Recognize your dream world, Max?

256
00:21:43,368 --> 00:21:45,700
Not really.

257
00:21:45,771 --> 00:21:49,298
I feel like I should,
but I just don't.

258
00:21:49,374 --> 00:21:51,865
It's affecting him too.

259
00:21:51,943 --> 00:21:54,241
I thought he would just remember.

260
00:21:54,313 --> 00:21:58,682
- Remember what?
- Your dreams. This planet?

261
00:21:59,318 --> 00:22:01,218
Us.

262
00:22:01,286 --> 00:22:03,846
Your powers.

263
00:22:03,922 --> 00:22:07,517
- I have powers?
- More than any of us.

264
00:22:07,592 --> 00:22:09,958
Don't you know that?

265
00:22:10,028 --> 00:22:14,590
Everything that is or was,
began with a dream.

266
00:22:14,666 --> 00:22:19,228
And you dreamt us, Max.
Us and this whole place.

267
00:22:19,304 --> 00:22:20,293
I did?

268
00:22:20,372 --> 00:22:24,035
Every dream you ever had
landed right here on Planet Drool.

269
00:22:24,109 --> 00:22:26,771
Why is it so dark?

270
00:22:26,845 --> 00:22:30,576
The planet is dying.
It began yesterday.

271
00:22:30,649 --> 00:22:33,311
What's the calculation, Sharkboy?

272
00:22:34,519 --> 00:22:38,455
45 minutes till the darkness
destroys Planet Drool.

273
00:22:38,523 --> 00:22:44,018
We didn't go to Earth to save <i>you,</i> Max.
We need you to save Planet Drool.

274
00:22:45,797 --> 00:22:47,458
But how?

275
00:22:47,532 --> 00:22:50,501
The Dream Lair
is on the other side of the planet.

276
00:22:50,569 --> 00:22:54,335
That's where your dreams are going bad.
We have to go there and reverse it.

277
00:22:54,406 --> 00:22:58,035
We have to travel through the Passage
of Time, catch the Train of Thought,

278
00:22:58,110 --> 00:23:00,271
swim down the Stream of Consciousness

279
00:23:00,345 --> 00:23:04,281
and skate across the Sea of Confusion -
now covered in ice.

280
00:23:04,349 --> 00:23:07,910
Why'd you do that, Max?
Why'd you freeze the ocean?

281
00:23:07,986 --> 00:23:09,248
I...

282
00:23:09,721 --> 00:23:10,745
Ouch!

283
00:23:10,822 --> 00:23:13,518
Max didn't mean to do it.
Did you, Max?

284
00:23:13,592 --> 00:23:18,689
Max is a good boy, otherwise
you and I would be evil, and we're not evil.

285
00:23:18,764 --> 00:23:21,198
I'm not evil, am I, Max?

286
00:23:21,266 --> 00:23:23,166
I don't think so.

287
00:23:23,235 --> 00:23:26,534
That's why we brought you here -
to put things back in order.

288
00:23:26,605 --> 00:23:30,166
We just have to stay positive.
It's not the end of the world.

289
00:23:30,242 --> 00:23:32,267
Not yet, it's not.

290
00:23:34,846 --> 00:23:37,440
The darkness! Run!

291
00:23:38,383 --> 00:23:40,248
This is like a bad dream!

292
00:23:40,318 --> 00:23:45,381
Oh, yeah? Just wait till you meet Mr.
Electric! He's the worst bad dream yet!

293
00:23:56,835 --> 00:23:59,065
Where is everyone?

294
00:23:59,171 --> 00:24:02,732
- Mostly trapped on Mount Neverrest.
- By Mr. Electric.

295
00:24:02,774 --> 00:24:06,642
But Planet Drool's a place for kids
to dream and have endless fun!

296
00:24:07,846 --> 00:24:11,111
It's endless fun, all right.
Once you get on...

297
00:24:15,287 --> 00:24:16,982
...you can't get off.

298
00:24:17,055 --> 00:24:20,718
Kids aren't allowed to rest,
'cause if they rest, they sleep,

299
00:24:20,792 --> 00:24:22,919
and if they sleep, they dream.

300
00:24:22,994 --> 00:24:26,259
- And if they dream...
- It takes power away from Mr. Electric.

301
00:24:26,331 --> 00:24:28,993
But we're gonna stop him
with our secret weapon.

302
00:24:29,067 --> 00:24:32,161
Shouldn't we save those kids first?

303
00:24:48,386 --> 00:24:50,650
Why can't I do that?

304
00:25:04,236 --> 00:25:07,069
Lavagirl! Hooray!

305
00:25:24,856 --> 00:25:28,053
Who knows where Mr. Electric is hiding?

306
00:25:29,861 --> 00:25:31,692
Everyone?

307
00:25:31,763 --> 00:25:36,564
They're not raising their hands.
You're all upside down.

308
00:25:38,803 --> 00:25:40,566
Ah.

309
00:25:40,639 --> 00:25:44,507
<i> Who is stopping</i>
<i>my unstoppable coasters?</i>

310
00:25:46,211 --> 00:25:48,941
<i>- Back in your seats!</i>
- Go! Run! Hide!

311
00:25:49,014 --> 00:25:51,676
- Let's get outta here!
<i>- Everyone back in your seats!</i>

312
00:25:51,750 --> 00:25:53,684
Who's Mr. Electric?

313
00:25:53,752 --> 00:25:59,884
He's supposed to provide light to the
planet, but all he brings now is darkness.

314
00:25:59,958 --> 00:26:02,051
<i>Fun has begun!</i>

315
00:26:19,044 --> 00:26:21,035
He's taking us up!

316
00:26:27,285 --> 00:26:31,085
My home! At half its normal power.

317
00:26:38,697 --> 00:26:41,165
He's taking us down.

318
00:26:47,439 --> 00:26:49,339
Show time!

319
00:27:04,122 --> 00:27:06,488
Keep playing! Never stop!

320
00:27:06,558 --> 00:27:11,120
Games and toys and laughs...
hey-hey-hey... and fun!

321
00:27:15,433 --> 00:27:19,802
Well, well, well.
If it isn't Sharkboy and Lavagirl.

322
00:27:19,871 --> 00:27:26,401
What are you doing halting my endless-fun
coaster and infiltrating my lair?

323
00:27:26,478 --> 00:27:28,605
We don't need permission from you.

324
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:30,238
Fiery!

325
00:27:30,315 --> 00:27:34,775
I don't believe we've met.
I'm Mr. Electric!

326
00:27:34,853 --> 00:27:38,482
Why are you bringing misery to our planet?
You're supposed to be running it.

327
00:27:38,556 --> 00:27:44,324
You're supposed to be running it.
I <i>am</i> running it - right into the ground.

328
00:27:44,396 --> 00:27:46,990
- Those are my orders.
- Who ordered that?

329
00:27:47,065 --> 00:27:52,162
No school, no discipline, no rules.
And, most important, no dreams.

330
00:27:52,237 --> 00:27:54,296
Dreams can destroy you, can't they?

331
00:27:54,372 --> 00:27:57,535
- My instincts tell me that is so.
- Really?

332
00:27:57,609 --> 00:28:03,047
- That's why we have to stop you.
- You and what army?

333
00:28:08,987 --> 00:28:11,080
- Now?
- Now.

334
00:28:28,106 --> 00:28:31,769
Ha-ha-ha-haa! Pee-pee-pee-pee...

335
00:28:56,067 --> 00:28:57,898
Feel the burn!

336
00:28:58,002 --> 00:28:59,560
Agh...

337
00:29:04,042 --> 00:29:06,875
Not for real. Aaah!

338
00:29:16,588 --> 00:29:18,351
Ha-ha!

339
00:29:42,313 --> 00:29:45,976
Internal radar, shark-like reflexes...
You're amazing!

340
00:29:46,050 --> 00:29:49,076
But is it enough to defeat Mr. Electric?

341
00:29:49,154 --> 00:29:52,419
We have our secret weapon, remember?

342
00:29:53,691 --> 00:29:57,593
Did you really believe you could stop me?

343
00:29:57,662 --> 00:29:59,459
Oh... Ah...

344
00:29:59,531 --> 00:30:02,694
I know we can't. But he can.

345
00:30:02,767 --> 00:30:04,792
Take it away, Max.

346
00:30:08,873 --> 00:30:12,604
- Show him what you're made of, Max.
- What am I supposed to do?

347
00:30:14,078 --> 00:30:17,570
- I told you this would happen.
- I thought he would just remember.

348
00:30:17,649 --> 00:30:18,980
Remember what?!

349
00:30:20,585 --> 00:30:22,951
The dream. Remember the dream.

350
00:30:23,021 --> 00:30:25,546
I don't remember half my dreams.

351
00:30:27,425 --> 00:30:30,053
That's why I write them
in my dream journal.

352
00:30:33,898 --> 00:30:37,026
What half of your dreams
<i>do</i> you remember?

353
00:30:37,101 --> 00:30:39,069
This one I remember.

354
00:30:39,137 --> 00:30:41,105
Where are you taking us?

355
00:30:41,172 --> 00:30:45,666
Where all useless dreams go -
to the Dream Graveyard!

356
00:30:47,278 --> 00:30:49,109
Whoa!

357
00:30:50,548 --> 00:30:52,140
Ploop!

358
00:30:58,289 --> 00:30:59,950
Cuckoo!

359
00:31:03,127 --> 00:31:06,824
Well, at least we're on
the Passage of Time.

360
00:31:06,898 --> 00:31:08,866
Maybe it'll take us to the Dream Lair.

361
00:31:08,933 --> 00:31:13,529
It's going in the wrong
direction. The Dream Lair's that way.

362
00:31:14,739 --> 00:31:16,707
What's in the Dream Lair?

363
00:31:16,774 --> 00:31:19,834
It's where all the dreams
that fuel Planet Drool are stored.

364
00:31:19,911 --> 00:31:21,902
But they're being destroyed.

365
00:31:21,980 --> 00:31:24,574
- How?
- That's what we have to find out.

366
00:31:24,649 --> 00:31:28,244
Soon even Sharkboy and I
will cease to exist.

367
00:31:28,319 --> 00:31:29,809
Duck!

368
00:31:33,625 --> 00:31:37,220
Max, where is your dream journal?

369
00:31:37,295 --> 00:31:39,092
Great thinking, Sharkie!

370
00:31:39,163 --> 00:31:43,497
We can read his dreams out loud
and turn everything back to the way it was.

371
00:31:43,568 --> 00:31:46,469
I may even realize my true identity.

372
00:31:47,138 --> 00:31:49,129
I threw it away.

373
00:31:50,575 --> 00:31:53,009
My journal's back on Earth.

374
00:31:57,482 --> 00:32:00,076
We really thought
you were the answer, Max.

375
00:32:00,151 --> 00:32:03,518
Don't listen to him. He's just upset
because you didn't show up

376
00:32:03,588 --> 00:32:07,786
and make him king of the ocean,
with a giant fish army to back him up.

377
00:32:07,859 --> 00:32:09,417
Look who's talking!

378
00:32:09,494 --> 00:32:12,986
You thought you'd find a great use
for your powers and heal the planet.

379
00:32:13,064 --> 00:32:18,058
Max thought his dream world would be
a happy place. We've all been duped.

380
00:32:19,570 --> 00:32:21,060
Ohh!

381
00:32:28,413 --> 00:32:30,881
I think you broke my fin.

382
00:32:32,317 --> 00:32:34,080
Sorry.

383
00:32:38,289 --> 00:32:42,919
Hey, you! I see you hiding!
Come back here!

384
00:32:44,262 --> 00:32:46,753
I was awakened!

385
00:32:47,432 --> 00:32:48,626
I'm sorry.

386
00:32:48,700 --> 00:32:52,261
Did all the children
from Mount Neverrest escape?

387
00:32:52,337 --> 00:32:55,704
It was Sharkboy and Lavagirl.
But I took care of it - see?

388
00:32:55,773 --> 00:32:57,638
Someone was with them?

389
00:32:57,742 --> 00:33:01,200
Just another child afraid of
his own shadow. No threat to us.

390
00:33:01,245 --> 00:33:03,907
I banished him to the Dream Graveyard.

391
00:33:03,982 --> 00:33:07,543
Where old dreams lie?
He could find an ally!

392
00:33:07,618 --> 00:33:13,181
I told you, every dream must be smashed,
every child captured!

393
00:33:13,257 --> 00:33:16,715
You want him back,
we'll simply track him when he falls asleep.

394
00:33:16,794 --> 00:33:20,286
Fool! He's the Daydreamer.

395
00:33:20,365 --> 00:33:24,825
And the moment he realizes it
will be the moment of our doom!

396
00:33:24,902 --> 00:33:26,529
Now what do you want me to do?

397
00:33:26,604 --> 00:33:29,698
Bring me the boy
before he discovers his true powers

398
00:33:29,774 --> 00:33:32,504
and tears my new kingdom apart!

399
00:33:33,244 --> 00:33:36,441
Plugs, redirect the darkness.

400
00:33:36,514 --> 00:33:38,379
And...

401
00:33:41,386 --> 00:33:44,753
bring me the Plughounds!

402
00:33:52,063 --> 00:33:55,226
We'll never find our way
out of this graveyard.

403
00:33:55,299 --> 00:33:58,200
Darkness! Headed this way!

404
00:33:59,303 --> 00:34:00,930
Sit down, Max.

405
00:34:01,005 --> 00:34:03,473
- What for?
- Close your eyes and dream.

406
00:34:03,541 --> 00:34:07,272
If Max can't remember his dreams,
maybe he can redream them.

407
00:34:07,345 --> 00:34:09,438
He could dream us out of here.

408
00:34:09,514 --> 00:34:11,675
Dream, Max.

409
00:34:13,985 --> 00:34:16,419
Now, what do you see?

410
00:34:16,487 --> 00:34:22,483
I see a... giant...
chocolate-chunk marshmallow cookie...

411
00:34:23,227 --> 00:34:26,060
with lots of warm milk.

412
00:34:27,398 --> 00:34:30,925
- Sorry. I'm starving.
- Here's some food.

413
00:34:31,002 --> 00:34:35,530
- You're not gonna like that.
- I'm so hungry I could eat lava rocks.

414
00:34:41,379 --> 00:34:43,176
What is that?!

415
00:34:43,247 --> 00:34:44,714
Lava rocks.

416
00:34:44,782 --> 00:34:47,512
Here, have some real food.
Fresh sushi.

417
00:34:47,585 --> 00:34:50,247
- It'll knock you right out.
- That's not fresh.

418
00:34:50,321 --> 00:34:52,687
I'm not even sure that's sushi anymore.

419
00:34:52,757 --> 00:34:56,625
- It's just a few weeks old.
- I'll cook it for you.

420
00:34:59,864 --> 00:35:00,853
Oops.

421
00:35:00,932 --> 00:35:03,196
It's OK. I'm not that hungry anymore.

422
00:35:03,267 --> 00:35:06,828
Let me just rest a moment.
Maybe I can sleep.

423
00:35:08,773 --> 00:35:11,435
It's getting closer.

424
00:35:14,679 --> 00:35:16,909
Get outta here!

425
00:35:19,817 --> 00:35:22,547
Max, I know you've got a lot to figure out,

426
00:35:22,620 --> 00:35:27,455
but if you happen to dream about who I am
and how I fit into this world,

427
00:35:27,525 --> 00:35:29,425
it would really be helpful for me...

428
00:35:29,494 --> 00:35:33,521
No distractions. You steer him off course,
we could be lost in a sea of dreams.

429
00:35:33,598 --> 00:35:36,999
- I'm sorry. I'm desperate.
- Focus on the problem at hand.

430
00:35:37,068 --> 00:35:40,663
Max needs to dream us out of here,
so how about I put him to sleep?

431
00:35:40,738 --> 00:35:44,435
- No, Sharkboy.
- Just one punch. He'll be out like a light.

432
00:35:48,179 --> 00:35:52,707
I've seen this before.
It's on the tip of my... finger.

433
00:35:53,317 --> 00:35:55,615
It's a hand!

434
00:35:56,754 --> 00:35:58,381
It <i>is</i> a hand.

435
00:36:00,258 --> 00:36:02,249
A hand?

436
00:36:03,094 --> 00:36:04,959
Another hand.

437
00:36:05,029 --> 00:36:06,257
Yep?

438
00:36:06,330 --> 00:36:08,389
- It's Tobor!
- Who?

439
00:36:08,466 --> 00:36:11,663
Tobor! I dreamt him up when I was a kid -

440
00:36:11,736 --> 00:36:14,762
a robot that could help me
with my homework.

441
00:36:14,839 --> 00:36:19,799
I tried to build him once. Everyone
kept telling me he would never work.

442
00:36:19,877 --> 00:36:23,938
So here he is - a forgotten dream
in the Dream Graveyard.

443
00:36:24,015 --> 00:36:26,711
Maybe he can help us.

444
00:36:26,784 --> 00:36:29,252
He's supposed to be very smart.

445
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:31,515
Tobor, awake!

446
00:36:32,323 --> 00:36:34,018
Yes?

447
00:36:34,091 --> 00:36:35,718
He works!

448
00:36:35,793 --> 00:36:38,956
- We can ask him anything now.
- Let me, let me!

449
00:36:39,030 --> 00:36:42,363
Tell me something about me.
I'm clueless.

450
00:36:42,433 --> 00:36:46,995
Actually, you are extremely bright.

451
00:36:47,838 --> 00:36:50,136
Am I king of the ocean, or what?

452
00:36:50,208 --> 00:36:52,403
No. Sorry.

453
00:36:53,477 --> 00:36:55,911
How do I save Planet Drool?

454
00:36:56,547 --> 00:37:00,210
The answer is in your dreams.

455
00:37:00,318 --> 00:37:03,845
You mean if I put him to sleep,
he'll dream us out of this mess?

456
00:37:03,888 --> 00:37:07,654
No. At least, not here.

457
00:37:07,725 --> 00:37:13,163
Darkness is falling. Any dream of his
would become a nightmare -

458
00:37:13,231 --> 00:37:16,496
and you don't want those
becoming a reality.

459
00:37:16,567 --> 00:37:20,025
But if you go
to the Land of Milk and Cookies...

460
00:37:20,104 --> 00:37:21,264
Of course!

461
00:37:21,339 --> 00:37:23,899
...that's where the good dreams are.

462
00:37:23,975 --> 00:37:26,535
Where the answers are.

463
00:37:26,611 --> 00:37:28,135
It's perfect, Max.

464
00:37:28,212 --> 00:37:31,579
The Land of Milk and Cookies
is a safe, sweet place.

465
00:37:31,649 --> 00:37:33,947
You'll be able to dream easily there.

466
00:37:34,018 --> 00:37:35,610
Can you take us?

467
00:37:35,686 --> 00:37:39,281
I have no body. I can't move.

468
00:37:39,357 --> 00:37:42,918
You can move your eyes and your mouth.

469
00:37:43,628 --> 00:37:46,392
Why didn't you work back on Earth, Tobor?

470
00:37:46,464 --> 00:37:51,902
Some dreams are so powerful they
become real - like Sharkboy and Lavagirl.

471
00:37:51,969 --> 00:37:56,906
I, on the other hand,
am still only a dream.

472
00:37:56,974 --> 00:37:57,963
Oh...

473
00:37:58,075 --> 00:38:02,068
- What's wrong?
- Train of Thought... I'm losing it.

474
00:38:02,113 --> 00:38:05,139
You were taking us to the Land
of Milk and Cookies, remember?

475
00:38:05,216 --> 00:38:09,949
I mean I'm literally losing
the Train of Thought. It's down there.

476
00:38:10,021 --> 00:38:13,752
That's the Train of Thought?
How do I keep it on track?

477
00:38:13,824 --> 00:38:18,420
With your mind. The Train of Thought
gets easily distracted.

478
00:38:18,496 --> 00:38:23,695
Stay focused, and it'll speed you directly
to the Land of Milk and Cookies.

479
00:38:23,768 --> 00:38:25,736
The rest is up to you.

480
00:38:25,803 --> 00:38:27,998
Sorry I forgot about you, Tobor.

481
00:38:28,072 --> 00:38:31,098
Are you kidding? You just saved me.

482
00:38:31,175 --> 00:38:33,735
I'm free!

483
00:38:38,916 --> 00:38:41,316
Max, get down here!

484
00:38:44,155 --> 00:38:47,318
- What's wrong?
- We can't control it.

485
00:38:47,391 --> 00:38:49,689
All you have to do is keep it on track.

486
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:53,594
How can you keep it on track
if there is no track?

487
00:38:56,834 --> 00:38:59,302
Looks like another dream gone bad!

488
00:39:00,838 --> 00:39:02,465
What do we do?

489
00:39:02,540 --> 00:39:05,236
Yell? Scream?

490
00:39:13,818 --> 00:39:15,979
Jump. It'll be all right.

491
00:39:32,503 --> 00:39:36,530
What does it mean
when your Train of Thought... wrecks?

492
00:39:36,607 --> 00:39:40,703
Well... It can't be good, buddy.

493
00:39:40,778 --> 00:39:43,747
How much time do we have, Sharkboy?

494
00:39:44,915 --> 00:39:47,281
20 minutes.

495
00:39:53,124 --> 00:39:54,113
Eww!

496
00:39:54,191 --> 00:39:57,456
Stick to rotten fish, please!

497
00:39:57,528 --> 00:40:01,396
Chocolate! I stepped in chocolate!

498
00:40:04,702 --> 00:40:06,863
We're here.

499
00:40:11,842 --> 00:40:14,470
The Land of Milk and Cookies!

500
00:40:16,781 --> 00:40:18,874
Oh, yeah!

501
00:40:21,886 --> 00:40:25,287
The milk is warm.
He'll be out in no time.

502
00:40:25,356 --> 00:40:29,190
Lay down.
Here's a marshmallow pillow.

503
00:40:29,260 --> 00:40:31,820
How about dreaming us
<i>into</i> the Dream Lair?

504
00:40:34,365 --> 00:40:36,959
The ground is thumping too much.

505
00:40:37,568 --> 00:40:40,036
My highly trained ears hear it too.

506
00:40:40,104 --> 00:40:42,334
Boom, boom, boom.

507
00:40:42,406 --> 00:40:44,704
- Let me hear it.
- I wouldn't.

508
00:40:48,145 --> 00:40:49,510
Hothead.

509
00:40:49,580 --> 00:40:55,644
When you dreamt up these giant cookies,
who did you expect to be able to eat them?

510
00:40:55,719 --> 00:40:57,550
I really didn't think about it.

511
00:40:57,655 --> 00:40:59,885
'Cause if you dream giant cookies,

512
00:40:59,924 --> 00:41:04,293
something has to be created
to <i>consume</i> giant cookies.

513
00:41:11,902 --> 00:41:13,802
Cookie giants!

514
00:41:36,927 --> 00:41:38,451
Ohh...

515
00:41:45,669 --> 00:41:47,728
Frosting.

516
00:41:51,208 --> 00:41:54,075
Those giants almost look like my parents.

517
00:41:54,144 --> 00:41:56,942
They seem happy together.
Is that your dream?

518
00:41:57,014 --> 00:42:01,144
We had a dream we're family.
It hasn't been coming true lately.

519
00:42:01,252 --> 00:42:06,019
Most dreams don't come true on their own.
You have to make them true.

520
00:42:06,056 --> 00:42:09,082
It takes a lot of work. Not easy.

521
00:42:09,994 --> 00:42:12,462
But not impossible either.

522
00:42:13,898 --> 00:42:16,162
Stinking fresh air!

523
00:42:16,667 --> 00:42:19,329
Blinding sunlight!

524
00:42:19,403 --> 00:42:24,864
Oh, how I long for a sky
of fluorescent lights!

525
00:42:36,854 --> 00:42:38,185
Ahh...

526
00:42:39,490 --> 00:42:41,890
Better stand back.

527
00:42:44,295 --> 00:42:46,388
All right, that was me.

528
00:42:47,598 --> 00:42:51,694
- Still empty-handed, I see.
- If you're so powerful, you find him.

529
00:42:51,769 --> 00:42:55,865
That's your job!
Do it, or I'll have you discharged!

530
00:42:55,940 --> 00:42:57,567
Shh...

531
00:42:58,409 --> 00:43:00,741
Someone is dreaming in here.

532
00:43:03,247 --> 00:43:07,741
All right, Max, you've had
your cookies and milk. Now go to sleep.

533
00:43:07,818 --> 00:43:10,184
I'll try.

534
00:43:10,254 --> 00:43:12,085
Go to sleep!

535
00:43:12,156 --> 00:43:15,250
Not like that. Sing him a lullaby.

536
00:43:22,232 --> 00:43:23,893
Your turn.

537
00:43:44,488 --> 00:43:47,252
It's working! Keep it up, Sharkboy.

538
00:44:04,008 --> 00:44:05,999
Dream about me next, Max.

539
00:44:06,076 --> 00:44:08,670
I need to know who I am.

540
00:44:08,746 --> 00:44:12,477
Not just destruction or a simple flame.

541
00:44:12,549 --> 00:44:15,211
Dream of me as something good.

542
00:44:26,730 --> 00:44:29,597
He's having a nightmare!
Wake up, Max! Wake up!

543
00:44:29,667 --> 00:44:33,501
Stop that racket, Sharkboy -
<i>you're</i> giving him nightmares!

544
00:44:34,371 --> 00:44:36,498
Sorry, Max.

545
00:44:36,573 --> 00:44:37,665
Argh!

546
00:44:37,741 --> 00:44:40,005
Ow! Ohh...

547
00:44:40,077 --> 00:44:41,942
What was that for?

548
00:44:42,012 --> 00:44:45,379
Your nightmare was about me, wasn't it?

549
00:44:45,449 --> 00:44:47,713
I don't remember.

550
00:44:47,785 --> 00:44:50,015
But I did dream about one thing...

551
00:44:51,188 --> 00:44:53,213
Plughounds!

552
00:44:55,626 --> 00:44:58,527
This may come as a shock to you.

553
00:45:01,265 --> 00:45:03,756
Feel the power!

554
00:45:08,038 --> 00:45:09,665
It's empty!

555
00:45:11,775 --> 00:45:13,106
Fudge.

556
00:45:13,877 --> 00:45:16,345
I forgot to dream of gas.

557
00:45:16,413 --> 00:45:19,007
Max!

558
00:45:33,230 --> 00:45:35,528
My powers are weakening.

559
00:45:39,403 --> 00:45:43,134
Watch the power lines - very dangerous.

560
00:45:53,484 --> 00:45:55,611
Yaaarrhh!

561
00:46:12,302 --> 00:46:14,293
Yaaarrhh!

562
00:46:15,305 --> 00:46:17,432
Sharkboy, get me down from here!

563
00:46:17,508 --> 00:46:20,068
Can't you see I'm busy?

564
00:46:39,229 --> 00:46:42,221
Hot lava... Hot lava...

565
00:46:47,504 --> 00:46:49,972
I don't got much fight left in me, Max.

566
00:46:50,040 --> 00:46:51,974
Where's Lavagirl?

567
00:46:53,076 --> 00:46:55,010
It's up to you now, Max.

568
00:46:55,078 --> 00:46:57,638
Dream us out of here.

569
00:46:57,748 --> 00:47:00,216
We believe in you, Max.

570
00:47:02,085 --> 00:47:06,385
Shark boat with turbo boosters!
Shark boat with turbo boosters!

571
00:47:09,660 --> 00:47:11,719
A banana split?!

572
00:47:11,795 --> 00:47:15,424
Still hungry, Max?
How about a knuckle sandwich?

573
00:47:15,499 --> 00:47:17,592
No, look!

574
00:47:17,668 --> 00:47:20,000
It's a banana-split boat!

575
00:47:21,004 --> 00:47:23,199
Then let's split!

576
00:47:24,208 --> 00:47:25,607
Ow!

577
00:47:25,676 --> 00:47:26,973
Huh?

578
00:47:48,665 --> 00:47:50,826
Catch you later.

579
00:47:51,668 --> 00:47:56,162
All dreamers must dream.

580
00:47:56,974 --> 00:48:00,603
This is great, Max.
You're starting to daydream.

581
00:48:00,711 --> 00:48:03,976
Keep that up, and they'll never get us.

582
00:48:04,014 --> 00:48:06,175
Why not?

583
00:48:06,250 --> 00:48:11,153
Learn to dream with your eyes open,
and you won't have to be asleep to dream.

584
00:48:11,221 --> 00:48:15,419
You'll be able to make anything happen
at any time.

585
00:48:30,774 --> 00:48:32,901
Sugar will give you nightmares.

586
00:48:32,976 --> 00:48:36,241
- How much time do we have?
- Don't ask.

587
00:48:37,014 --> 00:48:42,475
The Dream Lair's across the Ocean of Ice.
We'll have to travel there by foot.

588
00:48:42,552 --> 00:48:45,487
What was it you saw in your dream, Max?

589
00:48:46,290 --> 00:48:50,021
I saw an object shaped like...

590
00:48:50,961 --> 00:48:53,429
Give me something to draw with.

591
00:49:05,042 --> 00:49:07,067
The Crystal Heart!

592
00:49:07,144 --> 00:49:11,774
That's the treasure of the Land of Ice!
In the Ice Castle.

593
00:49:11,848 --> 00:49:15,648
It can freeze anything - even time.

594
00:49:15,719 --> 00:49:19,120
I've always dreamt
of freezing a moment in time.

595
00:49:19,189 --> 00:49:21,817
And the Ice Castle's
ruled by the Ice Princess.

596
00:49:21,892 --> 00:49:24,759
I hear she's the most beautiful girl
on the planet.

597
00:49:25,128 --> 00:49:26,152
Ouch!

598
00:49:26,229 --> 00:49:30,063
She is not! She's cold and cruel
and cares for nobody but herself.

599
00:49:30,133 --> 00:49:32,567
She's just saying that, Max.

600
00:49:32,636 --> 00:49:35,799
- Have you met her?
- No. But I know we don't get along.

601
00:49:35,872 --> 00:49:40,104
- How do you know that?
- I'm fire. She's ice.

602
00:49:40,177 --> 00:49:42,236
We must be enemies.

603
00:49:42,312 --> 00:49:44,610
We need that Crystal Heart.

604
00:49:44,681 --> 00:49:47,275
But I need you both to get it.

605
00:49:47,818 --> 00:49:50,252
I just hope this isn't a trap.

606
00:49:50,320 --> 00:49:51,719
Whoa!

607
00:49:55,459 --> 00:49:57,893
If we freeze time with the Crystal Heart,

608
00:49:57,961 --> 00:50:01,692
we'll be able to make it to the Dream Lair
and save the planet.

609
00:50:01,765 --> 00:50:03,756
That's the plan.

610
00:50:06,003 --> 00:50:08,130
Behold the Ice Castle!

611
00:50:08,205 --> 00:50:11,003
Home to the Princess of the Land of Ice.

612
00:50:11,074 --> 00:50:15,374
- The Crystal Heart's inside the castle?
- So they say.

613
00:50:15,445 --> 00:50:17,572
Let's go.

614
00:50:36,733 --> 00:50:39,566
It's no use! I'll melt the bridge.

615
00:50:39,636 --> 00:50:42,002
This place inflames me.

616
00:50:42,072 --> 00:50:44,506
Can you cool down enough to get across?

617
00:50:44,574 --> 00:50:46,667
I'd have to be asleep to do that.

618
00:50:47,444 --> 00:50:49,844
Can you try sleepwalking?

619
00:50:54,985 --> 00:51:00,184
My dream is to live on Earth -
but someplace warm -

620
00:51:00,290 --> 00:51:02,417
and that Earth will accept me,

621
00:51:02,459 --> 00:51:06,225
even... if I... destroy...

622
00:51:06,930 --> 00:51:09,262
everything I... touch!

623
00:51:09,800 --> 00:51:12,735
No, Lavagirl! Don't sneeze!

624
00:51:21,344 --> 00:51:22,834
Aaa-tchoo!

625
00:51:22,913 --> 00:51:24,904
Aarghh...

626
00:51:29,786 --> 00:51:30,946
Look.

627
00:51:33,056 --> 00:51:35,081
She's sleeping.

628
00:51:53,677 --> 00:51:56,737
- They've found us again! Lavagirl!
- Shh!

629
00:51:56,813 --> 00:51:59,475
If you wake her up, she'll reheat.

630
00:52:00,484 --> 00:52:02,315
She can make it.

631
00:52:10,927 --> 00:52:13,361
Lavagirl, they're behind you!

632
00:52:33,917 --> 00:52:36,715
- Let's go. Hurry!
- Argh!

633
00:52:38,755 --> 00:52:40,484
It's a trap!

634
00:52:41,791 --> 00:52:47,195
You can almost feel
the electricity in the air, can't you?

635
00:52:47,264 --> 00:52:51,894
This is all wrong.
Someone else's dreams are in here.

636
00:52:51,968 --> 00:52:54,095
Lights out!

637
00:53:06,683 --> 00:53:10,016
Welcome to the Dream Lair!

638
00:53:10,086 --> 00:53:12,987
I am the ruler of Planet Drool.

639
00:53:13,056 --> 00:53:16,492
No, you're not! Max is!

640
00:53:16,893 --> 00:53:20,420
Max may have dreamed it originally...

641
00:53:23,033 --> 00:53:26,730
but I am much... cooler.

642
00:53:27,470 --> 00:53:30,337
I... am Minus.

643
00:53:31,708 --> 00:53:33,903
How'd you get so powerful?

644
00:53:33,977 --> 00:53:36,138
I do a lot of reading.

645
00:53:36,213 --> 00:53:37,942
My book of dreams!

646
00:53:38,014 --> 00:53:42,246
That's why everything's so messed up -
he's changing it!

647
00:53:42,319 --> 00:53:44,685
Electric eels.

648
00:53:48,558 --> 00:53:51,527
Shocking, isn't it, Sharkboy?

649
00:53:51,595 --> 00:53:58,467
Reminds me of the time that electrical
storm blew apart your father's laboratory.

650
00:54:00,070 --> 00:54:02,197
- Where is my father?
- Hm.

651
00:54:02,272 --> 00:54:04,263
Let's see.

652
00:54:07,777 --> 00:54:10,109
Check the bottom of the ocean.

653
00:54:13,116 --> 00:54:15,482
And Lavagirl...

654
00:54:15,552 --> 00:54:18,544
Once I figure out
how to freeze this planet's core,

655
00:54:18,622 --> 00:54:21,182
all of your powers will disappear.

656
00:54:21,258 --> 00:54:24,125
Powers? What powers?

657
00:54:26,529 --> 00:54:30,226
And last but least, Max.

658
00:54:30,300 --> 00:54:33,497
You thought you could escape fear
by running away to dreamland.

659
00:54:33,570 --> 00:54:38,473
But fear exists
in the one place you can never escape!

660
00:54:39,576 --> 00:54:41,567
Your mind!

661
00:54:42,946 --> 00:54:45,312
I will show you the true meaning of fear.

662
00:54:45,382 --> 00:54:48,442
When darkness falls,
the rest of your dreams will be destroyed

663
00:54:48,518 --> 00:54:51,214
and I will rule Planet Drool.

664
00:54:51,288 --> 00:54:54,917
Blah-blah-blah, threat-threat-threat...

665
00:54:54,991 --> 00:54:59,519
You must all leave now.
I have some dreaming to do.

666
00:54:59,896 --> 00:55:01,488
Whoa!

667
00:55:09,472 --> 00:55:12,373
If I could just get my dream journal,

668
00:55:13,476 --> 00:55:16,707
I could turn everything
back to the way it was.

669
00:55:17,514 --> 00:55:19,778
My fire's dimming.

670
00:55:21,985 --> 00:55:23,680
I can't melt the bars.

671
00:55:23,753 --> 00:55:26,722
My strength is failing me as well.

672
00:55:28,224 --> 00:55:30,385
How much time do we have, Sharkboy?

673
00:55:30,460 --> 00:55:34,863
Who cares?
We're never getting out of here.

674
00:55:37,067 --> 00:55:39,126
La La's.

675
00:55:45,875 --> 00:55:47,536
They like you.

676
00:55:47,610 --> 00:55:50,977
- I don't feel distracted right now.
- I do!

677
00:55:51,047 --> 00:55:53,242
This song is driving me crazy!

678
00:55:53,316 --> 00:55:56,342
Don't worry about him.
He's a cold fish.

679
00:55:56,419 --> 00:55:58,478
I'm serious!

680
00:55:59,289 --> 00:56:02,281
They're singing at a frequency...

681
00:56:02,359 --> 00:56:04,827
my highly trained ears find...

682
00:56:04,894 --> 00:56:06,555
disturbing!

683
00:56:06,629 --> 00:56:08,995
Sing louder. Sing higher.

684
00:56:12,869 --> 00:56:15,667
You don't wanna be too close to him
when he explodes.

685
00:56:17,273 --> 00:56:18,331
Aaargghh!

686
00:56:18,408 --> 00:56:20,035
Shark frenzy!

687
00:56:32,622 --> 00:56:35,090
Nice job channeling your anger, Sharkie.

688
00:56:37,260 --> 00:56:38,284
Huh.

689
00:57:06,089 --> 00:57:10,150
First things first.
Transportation out of here.

690
00:57:13,129 --> 00:57:15,097
My dreams.

691
00:57:19,102 --> 00:57:21,866
Lavagirl, you have a lava bike!

692
00:57:21,938 --> 00:57:23,428
I do?

693
00:57:23,940 --> 00:57:25,931
I do!

694
00:57:28,478 --> 00:57:30,469
This is so exciting!

695
00:57:30,547 --> 00:57:32,139
Cool it, Lavagirl.

696
00:57:32,215 --> 00:57:35,309
Everything we need
is right here in this book.

697
00:57:38,054 --> 00:57:43,583
Sharkboy... your father really is
at the bottom of the ocean.

698
00:57:50,900 --> 00:57:53,334
He's in a submarine.

699
00:57:53,970 --> 00:57:55,995
Looking for you!

700
00:57:58,808 --> 00:58:02,073
He's over the hydrothermal vents,
Mid-Atlantic Ridge,

701
00:58:02,145 --> 00:58:06,582
42 degrees west by 14 north.
Depth: 1800 meters.

702
00:58:06,649 --> 00:58:08,742
Near a snake pit!

703
00:58:08,818 --> 00:58:10,581
I need to get back to Earth.

704
00:58:10,653 --> 00:58:14,350
- What's it say about me?
- I'm not sure what this is.

705
00:58:14,424 --> 00:58:17,552
I can figure it out. Maybe there's
a section on my true identity.

706
00:58:17,627 --> 00:58:19,618
Lavagirl, no!

707
00:58:20,630 --> 00:58:24,031
Oh, no. What have I done?

708
00:58:24,100 --> 00:58:26,364
That's terrific, LG!

709
00:58:29,606 --> 00:58:33,474
It's OK, Lavagirl.
It was an accident.

710
00:58:34,344 --> 00:58:37,575
Why did you make me out of lava?!
Why, Max?

711
00:58:39,182 --> 00:58:43,414
Just let her cool down.
She's just blowing off steam.

712
00:58:48,124 --> 00:58:50,422
I know I can be good.

713
00:58:51,127 --> 00:58:53,254
I can feel it.

714
00:58:54,731 --> 00:58:57,598
But everything I touch, I destroy.

715
00:58:58,968 --> 00:59:04,668
Why did you make me like that?
I have more potential.

716
00:59:04,741 --> 00:59:06,868
I'm sure you do.

717
00:59:07,877 --> 00:59:12,473
And why'd you make us a team?
We're nothing alike.

718
00:59:12,549 --> 00:59:16,542
When I'm near water, I fizzle out.
When he's near heat, he shrivels.

719
00:59:16,619 --> 00:59:18,416
We're not compatible.

720
00:59:20,056 --> 00:59:23,082
Your... hair's on fire.

721
00:59:23,159 --> 00:59:25,593
Yeah, it does that.

722
00:59:28,831 --> 00:59:30,822
Thanks, Sharkie.

723
00:59:33,570 --> 00:59:35,868
Maybe I really am evil.

724
00:59:36,573 --> 00:59:41,203
So far everything else you've dreamed
has been correct.

725
00:59:41,277 --> 00:59:43,939
Maybe I just need to learn to accept it.

726
00:59:45,281 --> 00:59:49,581
That's it! Everything I've dreamt so far
has been correct.

727
00:59:49,652 --> 00:59:51,381
The Crystal Heart!

728
00:59:51,454 --> 00:59:57,051
Yeah, we were captured, but that's
'cause Minus doesn't want me to get it.

729
01:00:00,930 --> 01:00:03,455
We have to get back to the Ice Castle.

730
01:00:03,533 --> 01:00:06,093
10 minutes left. We'll never make it!

731
01:00:06,169 --> 01:00:08,899
- We can do it!
- How?

732
01:00:09,806 --> 01:00:13,742
You're Sharkboy and Lavagirl.
You can do anything.

733
01:00:21,250 --> 01:00:23,218
Wake up!

734
01:00:24,187 --> 01:00:25,654
What?

735
01:00:25,722 --> 01:00:29,658
He escaped.
And he's getting the Crystal Heart.

736
01:00:29,726 --> 01:00:31,887
Shut it down. Shut it all down now!

737
01:00:31,961 --> 01:00:36,421
I did. It's on a grid system.
It takes time for the darkness to travel.

738
01:00:36,499 --> 01:00:39,093
- How soon?
- Not soon enough.

739
01:00:39,168 --> 01:00:41,602
- Then destroy him.
- How?

740
01:00:41,671 --> 01:00:47,371
By smashing his most precious dream:
Sharkboy and Lavagirl.

741
01:01:07,563 --> 01:01:09,963
Is that what you saw, Max?

742
01:01:10,033 --> 01:01:11,193
Yes.

743
01:01:11,267 --> 01:01:14,668
You'll have to climb the ice pillar and get it.

744
01:01:14,737 --> 01:01:18,571
It's as delicate as a snowflake,
so don't drop it.

745
01:01:18,641 --> 01:01:22,008
And don't touch it with your hands either -
you'll freeze.

746
01:01:22,078 --> 01:01:24,103
Use your claws.

747
01:01:30,420 --> 01:01:32,786
Aaarrhh...

748
01:01:38,661 --> 01:01:40,822
Lava, can you...?

749
01:01:41,431 --> 01:01:43,456
Never mind.

750
01:01:44,167 --> 01:01:47,330
Chew on some ice. It'll keep you cool.

751
01:01:52,875 --> 01:01:53,864
Hm.

752
01:02:19,569 --> 01:02:21,662
Great job, Max.

753
01:02:27,110 --> 01:02:29,010
I got it!

754
01:02:35,785 --> 01:02:38,253
She's frozen solid!

755
01:02:56,239 --> 01:02:59,208
Kneel before the Ice Princess.

756
01:03:08,551 --> 01:03:12,112
You tried to steal the Crystal Heart.
Why?

757
01:03:15,558 --> 01:03:20,291
We believe it can freeze time.
Long enough for us to defeat Minus.

758
01:03:20,363 --> 01:03:25,096
My Crystal Heart cannot help you.
Only I have the power to use it.

759
01:03:25,168 --> 01:03:28,228
- Then come with us.
- She can never leave this castle.

760
01:03:28,304 --> 01:03:33,799
The crystal is the only thing
that protects our kingdom.

761
01:03:33,876 --> 01:03:36,538
Please, Princess.
We're running out of time.

762
01:03:36,612 --> 01:03:38,944
Perhaps I could give it to you.

763
01:03:39,015 --> 01:03:42,781
- Not without my blessing.
- Father, you're smothering me again.

764
01:03:43,986 --> 01:03:46,352
But are you worthy to wield it?

765
01:03:46,422 --> 01:03:47,753
Yes.

766
01:03:47,824 --> 01:03:50,452
The crystal you stole was a decoy.

767
01:03:50,526 --> 01:03:54,018
The true Crystal Heart
is somewhere in this room.

768
01:03:54,096 --> 01:03:58,260
Choose the correct one,
and you may carry it before you.

769
01:03:58,367 --> 01:04:00,062
Pick that one.

770
01:04:02,205 --> 01:04:04,196
It's around your neck.

771
01:04:06,742 --> 01:04:10,200
- How'd you know?
- I saw it in my dream.

772
01:04:10,880 --> 01:04:16,512
Usually, if you snooze, you lose.
With Max, you snooze, you win.

773
01:04:20,523 --> 01:04:24,983
But be warned, Max,
if anything happens to my Crystal Heart,

774
01:04:25,061 --> 01:04:28,519
my entire kingdom will be destroyed.

775
01:04:28,598 --> 01:04:32,728
Do you, Max, take this Crystal Heart
to have and to hold,

776
01:04:32,802 --> 01:04:36,238
in sickness and in health,
till death do you part?

777
01:04:36,305 --> 01:04:37,363
I do.

778
01:04:37,440 --> 01:04:39,840
- Do you trust him with your heart?
- I do.

779
01:04:39,909 --> 01:04:42,309
Do you mean what you say?

780
01:04:42,778 --> 01:04:44,177
Yes.

781
01:04:44,247 --> 01:04:46,147
I mean, I do.

782
01:04:46,215 --> 01:04:50,174
The crystal will now work -
but my daughter must stay here.

783
01:04:50,253 --> 01:04:52,312
Off with you, then!

784
01:04:52,388 --> 01:04:53,855
Good luck.

785
01:05:01,264 --> 01:05:04,199
We're almost at the Dream Lair!

786
01:05:04,267 --> 01:05:07,532
If we're gonna do this, we gotta do it now!

787
01:05:07,603 --> 01:05:11,403
- How much time?
- We're out of time!

788
01:05:11,474 --> 01:05:13,465
10 seconds!

789
01:05:20,783 --> 01:05:21,807
What?

790
01:05:21,884 --> 01:05:23,511
I can't hear you.

791
01:05:23,586 --> 01:05:25,747
- Five seconds.
- Here it goes.

792
01:05:25,821 --> 01:05:28,722
Three, two, one...

793
01:05:31,527 --> 01:05:33,392
We're out of time.

794
01:05:33,462 --> 01:05:35,828
- What happened?
- It didn't work.

795
01:05:35,898 --> 01:05:38,059
How could it not work?

796
01:05:40,670 --> 01:05:43,764
I was trying to tell you! Whoa...

797
01:05:44,573 --> 01:05:46,666
Only the Ice Princess can use it.

798
01:05:46,742 --> 01:05:49,905
It's not her fault
her father won't let her leave her castle.

799
01:05:49,979 --> 01:05:51,640
Boo-hoo.

800
01:05:51,714 --> 01:05:53,909
No underwater readings.

801
01:05:55,251 --> 01:05:57,242
No anything!

802
01:06:04,360 --> 01:06:07,420
I'll rip your sockets to shreds!

803
01:06:07,496 --> 01:06:11,364
Calm down, Sharkboy.
Mr. Electric's baiting you.

804
01:06:11,434 --> 01:06:13,698
I can't... fight...

805
01:06:14,236 --> 01:06:16,261
my instincts!

806
01:06:16,339 --> 01:06:18,102
No, Sharkboy!

807
01:06:21,844 --> 01:06:23,277
Hey!

808
01:06:24,046 --> 01:06:26,412
Watts... up?

809
01:06:26,949 --> 01:06:28,883
You know - watts.

810
01:06:29,385 --> 01:06:31,979
As in a measure of electrical power.

811
01:06:32,054 --> 01:06:34,522
The 60-watt bulb?

812
01:06:34,590 --> 01:06:38,185
Watts up?

813
01:06:38,260 --> 01:06:39,727
What?

814
01:06:39,795 --> 01:06:44,061
Electric eels. That's what's up.

815
01:06:44,133 --> 01:06:46,533
Swim away, Sharkboy! Swim away!

816
01:07:07,023 --> 01:07:09,321
Can he survive down there?

817
01:07:09,392 --> 01:07:12,623
He can hold his breath, but not forever.

818
01:07:12,695 --> 01:07:16,756
- He'll drown if I don't go get him.
- I can't let you go.

819
01:07:16,832 --> 01:07:18,857
You'll die too.

820
01:07:21,270 --> 01:07:23,761
He's my best friend.

821
01:07:45,995 --> 01:07:48,190
Come on, Sharkboy.

822
01:07:55,004 --> 01:07:57,404
Come on, Sharkboy!

823
01:08:04,613 --> 01:08:07,309
Sharkboy! Wake up, Sharkboy!

824
01:08:12,221 --> 01:08:13,586
Lavagirl!

825
01:08:14,490 --> 01:08:17,482
Lavagirl! Lavagirl, please!

826
01:08:18,360 --> 01:08:20,225
Lavagirl...

827
01:08:26,402 --> 01:08:28,836
What am I gonna do now?

828
01:08:30,573 --> 01:08:33,337
What do you think you should do?

829
01:08:35,478 --> 01:08:37,776
Dream a better dream.

830
01:08:37,847 --> 01:08:40,441
Interesting. Explain.

831
01:08:41,517 --> 01:08:47,149
I wanted all my dreams to come true,
but I only dreamt for myself.

832
01:08:47,223 --> 01:08:50,283
I wanted to escape my real world,

833
01:08:50,359 --> 01:08:54,523
when the world needed my help
to make it a better place.

834
01:08:55,698 --> 01:08:58,599
Selfish dreams shouldn't come true.

835
01:08:58,701 --> 01:09:01,727
You're becoming
a very good dreamer, Max.

836
01:09:01,770 --> 01:09:04,261
A very good dreamer indeed.

837
01:09:06,509 --> 01:09:11,208
What do you do
when your dreams have been destroyed?

838
01:09:11,280 --> 01:09:14,147
Dream a better dream.

839
01:09:14,216 --> 01:09:17,151
An unselfish dream.

840
01:09:24,527 --> 01:09:27,860
She knew this would happen
if she saved you.

841
01:09:27,930 --> 01:09:30,057
But I couldn't stop her.

842
01:09:33,969 --> 01:09:35,334
Look!

843
01:09:37,873 --> 01:09:39,864
Lava.

844
01:09:41,010 --> 01:09:43,274
We have to get her to that volcano.

845
01:09:43,345 --> 01:09:46,075
I'll go. I'm stronger and faster.

846
01:09:46,148 --> 01:09:48,139
You'll burn up.

847
01:09:51,453 --> 01:09:55,651
- Sure this will save her?
- It'll do more than save her.

848
01:10:02,464 --> 01:10:05,558
I know who you are, Lavagirl.

849
01:10:06,468 --> 01:10:10,165
<i>You are not fire, or a simple flame. </i>

850
01:10:10,973 --> 01:10:13,567
<i>You are greater than that. </i>

851
01:10:13,642 --> 01:10:17,908
<i>Something more important,</i>
<i>and so necessary. </i>

852
01:10:18,881 --> 01:10:21,577
It is why you must live.

853
01:10:25,221 --> 01:10:27,519
You are not destruction.

854
01:10:36,632 --> 01:10:38,532
You are not evil.

855
01:10:48,410 --> 01:10:50,139
Stand back.

856
01:10:52,514 --> 01:10:55,381
You are... light.

857
01:11:08,831 --> 01:11:12,790
Who turned on the lights?! Oh!

858
01:11:13,535 --> 01:11:16,265
Power, everywhere!

859
01:11:31,253 --> 01:11:34,518
Whoa! How'd you get here so fast?

860
01:11:34,590 --> 01:11:37,923
Hold off Mr. Electric
while I deal with Minus.

861
01:11:37,993 --> 01:11:40,427
I'll need my fish army.

862
01:11:40,496 --> 01:11:42,623
I'll unfreeze the ocean.

863
01:11:44,633 --> 01:11:46,498
Good luck.

864
01:11:49,705 --> 01:11:52,071
I've become what you feared most...

865
01:11:52,141 --> 01:11:54,006
Minus.

866
01:11:55,044 --> 01:11:56,807
How did you get in here?

867
01:11:56,879 --> 01:12:02,818
I'm the Daydreamer,
able to dream with my eyes open.

868
01:12:02,918 --> 01:12:06,786
Hate to burst your bubble, Dream Boy,
but I read your book.

869
01:12:06,822 --> 01:12:10,815
There's not one dream you've got
that I haven't already seen.

870
01:12:10,893 --> 01:12:15,921
So what do you say?
Let's blow the roof off this place.

871
01:12:20,302 --> 01:12:22,862
May the best dream win!

872
01:12:47,196 --> 01:12:48,185
Wait!

873
01:12:53,635 --> 01:12:55,500
Brainstorm!

874
01:13:08,984 --> 01:13:10,576
Eugh!

875
01:13:11,286 --> 01:13:13,754
Brain... freeze!

876
01:13:17,092 --> 01:13:18,889
Brain...

877
01:13:20,095 --> 01:13:21,357
fart!

878
01:13:25,234 --> 01:13:26,223
Oh...

879
01:13:41,950 --> 01:13:44,748
Get ready for the ultimate power outage.

880
01:13:46,588 --> 01:13:51,992
And who are you to believe
that you can defeat me now?

881
01:13:52,060 --> 01:13:54,153
No one special.

882
01:13:54,229 --> 01:13:58,063
Just... king of the ocean.

883
01:14:05,974 --> 01:14:07,407
Ooh...

884
01:14:11,747 --> 01:14:13,874
Shark frenzy.

885
01:14:13,949 --> 01:14:17,350
Aaarhh... Aaarhh... Aaarhh...

886
01:14:17,419 --> 01:14:18,784
A- ha!

887
01:14:19,354 --> 01:14:22,414
You're afraid of me, aren't you?

888
01:14:26,395 --> 01:14:28,329
I used to be.

889
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:34,298
Someone smashed <i>your</i> dreams once -

890
01:14:34,369 --> 01:14:37,634
now all you can do
is smash everyone else's.

891
01:14:45,547 --> 01:14:49,847
We can create a better dream than this.
A better world.

892
01:14:49,918 --> 01:14:51,977
Don't you see?

893
01:14:57,960 --> 01:15:00,019
What do you say...

894
01:15:01,096 --> 01:15:03,087
Linus?

895
01:15:14,776 --> 01:15:16,835
Hurry!

896
01:15:17,346 --> 01:15:19,576
No!

897
01:15:23,218 --> 01:15:26,654
Don't let me fall!

898
01:15:28,690 --> 01:15:31,056
Wouldn't dream of it.

899
01:15:39,368 --> 01:15:44,032
Don't smash people's dreams, Linus,
because you'll smash your own as well.

900
01:15:44,573 --> 01:15:46,939
And you too will stop believing.

901
01:15:51,213 --> 01:15:53,408
Max!

902
01:15:53,482 --> 01:15:55,347
I am light.

903
01:15:55,417 --> 01:15:56,509
Thank you.

904
01:15:56,585 --> 01:16:00,715
You were always that.
It had nothing to do with me.

905
01:16:00,822 --> 01:16:04,019
But now I know. So thank you.

906
01:16:04,059 --> 01:16:08,553
OK, so she's a light. Big deal.

907
01:16:08,630 --> 01:16:12,896
The real news is... what <i>I</i> am.

908
01:16:12,968 --> 01:16:14,959
Annoying?

909
01:16:15,771 --> 01:16:18,239
King of the ocean.

910
01:16:18,307 --> 01:16:20,400
Thanks for saving me.

911
01:16:24,513 --> 01:16:26,447
Ouch.

912
01:16:26,515 --> 01:16:29,382
Everything will return
to being the way it was.

913
01:16:29,451 --> 01:16:32,614
You will be able to travel to Earth
and back again as you wish.

914
01:16:32,688 --> 01:16:36,124
You can search for your father.
You can rule Earth's lava world.

915
01:16:36,191 --> 01:16:41,128
And what am I to do,
now that you're all buddy-buddy?

916
01:16:41,863 --> 01:16:47,062
Mr. Electric can go back
to being the good electrician of the planet.

917
01:16:47,135 --> 01:16:48,568
Oh, really?

918
01:16:48,637 --> 01:16:50,969
Plugging in power cords?

919
01:16:51,039 --> 01:16:54,338
Keeping this loud, obnoxious world
a happy place?

920
01:16:54,409 --> 01:16:55,899
You're dreaming!

921
01:16:55,978 --> 01:16:58,913
I dreamt you up,
and I can undream you.

922
01:16:59,014 --> 01:17:04,782
You think you can just snap your eyes
open and make me vanish? Not so easy.

923
01:17:04,820 --> 01:17:07,755
I am the danger of dreaming.

924
01:17:07,823 --> 01:17:10,690
For every person
who dreams up the electric light bulb,

925
01:17:10,759 --> 01:17:14,195
there's the one
who dreams up the atom bomb.

926
01:17:14,262 --> 01:17:16,696
This is one dream
you won't be waking up from.

927
01:17:16,765 --> 01:17:21,429
I'm gonna put an end
to this ridiculous tangent at its source!

928
01:17:23,238 --> 01:17:25,365
Where did he go?

929
01:17:26,608 --> 01:17:28,269
He's headed to Earth.

930
01:17:28,343 --> 01:17:32,109
He's going to try and destroy you
in your sleep.

931
01:17:33,048 --> 01:17:35,073
In my sleep?

932
01:17:36,685 --> 01:17:41,850
You mean I'm asleep?
All this time I've been asleep?

933
01:17:41,923 --> 01:17:44,858
No. You're dreaming, Max.

934
01:17:44,926 --> 01:17:47,019
With your eyes open.

935
01:17:47,095 --> 01:17:48,926
Make the dream real.

936
01:17:48,997 --> 01:17:53,730
You can live out your dreams on Earth.
Just like you made us real.

937
01:17:53,802 --> 01:17:55,326
Make it real.

938
01:17:55,404 --> 01:17:58,339
Blink your eyes three times.

939
01:17:58,440 --> 01:18:00,408
One...

940
01:18:00,442 --> 01:18:02,876
Wait. What happens when...?

941
01:18:02,944 --> 01:18:04,172
Two...

942
01:18:06,515 --> 01:18:08,574
Will I ever see you again?

943
01:18:08,650 --> 01:18:10,208
Three.

944
01:18:18,060 --> 01:18:22,394
Everyone follow me, I said!
We've got to find shelter!

945
01:18:23,131 --> 01:18:27,534
Max, get up!
There's a tornado heading our way!

946
01:18:29,304 --> 01:18:35,072
It's not a tornado.
It's much worse than that.

947
01:18:35,143 --> 01:18:37,270
Linus, wake up!

948
01:18:37,345 --> 01:18:39,210
Look!

949
01:18:47,322 --> 01:18:49,586
Charge!

950
01:18:49,658 --> 01:18:54,994
It's Mr. Electric from Planet Drool!
The one from my dreams!

951
01:18:55,063 --> 01:18:59,397
You mean... this is real?
Your dream is real?

952
01:18:59,501 --> 01:19:03,096
Some dreams are so powerful
they become real.

953
01:19:03,138 --> 01:19:04,935
I don't believe it.

954
01:19:05,006 --> 01:19:07,736
- It's right there in front of you!
- I can see that!

955
01:19:07,809 --> 01:19:14,305
What I can't believe is you dreamt me
as a big round bad guy! I'm not bad!

956
01:19:14,783 --> 01:19:18,275
Sorry. Kinda took on a life of its own.

957
01:19:22,991 --> 01:19:27,951
- Max is in Building C.
- No, he's not. He's in Building W.

958
01:19:28,029 --> 01:19:30,589
That was the other school!

959
01:19:42,944 --> 01:19:44,844
Aaarhh!

960
01:19:44,913 --> 01:19:46,346
Help!

961
01:19:48,984 --> 01:19:51,578
Find Max! Tell him I love him!

962
01:19:52,120 --> 01:19:55,647
- Don't leave me!
- I thought you wanted me to leave.

963
01:19:56,124 --> 01:19:59,685
No, I don't. You're my best friend.

964
01:20:00,195 --> 01:20:02,026
I love you.

965
01:20:03,064 --> 01:20:04,691
I love you too.

966
01:20:04,766 --> 01:20:07,291
Aaargh!

967
01:20:09,638 --> 01:20:11,765
Come back!

968
01:20:13,208 --> 01:20:15,699
Please, come back.

969
01:20:24,920 --> 01:20:27,946
I'm not going anywhere.

970
01:20:28,990 --> 01:20:31,083
Neither am I.

971
01:20:31,159 --> 01:20:33,184
Aah... Aargh!

972
01:20:35,597 --> 01:20:37,030
Uh-oh.

973
01:20:37,098 --> 01:20:39,532
Aaargghh!

974
01:20:50,345 --> 01:20:55,510
OK, class. I'm just a teacher, and
I'm here to inspire the answers from you.

975
01:20:55,584 --> 01:20:58,553
And I think that's some
pretty good inspiration outside.

976
01:20:58,653 --> 01:21:03,920
So this is now a pop quiz.
We need to defeat that guy. Any ideas?

977
01:21:04,860 --> 01:21:08,421
Wow, Linus. You get a plus
for being the first hand in the air.

978
01:21:08,496 --> 01:21:10,657
I can take him.

979
01:21:10,732 --> 01:21:12,427
Linus, watch out!

980
01:21:15,237 --> 01:21:17,205
- Poop.
- Aaargh!

981
01:21:17,272 --> 01:21:19,001
Ohh...

982
01:21:23,745 --> 01:21:25,110
Nice try.

983
01:21:25,180 --> 01:21:27,944
Sorry, Max. Your journal.

984
01:21:28,016 --> 01:21:30,610
It's OK. It was an accident.

985
01:21:30,685 --> 01:21:33,176
Plenty more dreams
where those came from.

986
01:21:35,023 --> 01:21:38,390
OK, kids, who's next?
Remember, there are no dumb ideas.

987
01:21:38,460 --> 01:21:42,021
- Maybe we can freeze his circuits.
- That's the dumbest idea I ever heard.

988
01:21:42,097 --> 01:21:45,555
We're in the middle of Texas in August!
Next idea? Anyone but Linus.

989
01:21:45,634 --> 01:21:49,070
Wait - that's a great idea!
Thanks, Linus.

990
01:21:49,137 --> 01:21:51,401
Come here, Marissa.

991
01:21:56,278 --> 01:21:58,212
Is this yours?

992
01:21:58,313 --> 01:22:00,178
How'd you find it?

993
01:22:00,215 --> 01:22:02,479
So you've seen this?

994
01:22:03,084 --> 01:22:07,077
Yes, but... only in a dream.

995
01:22:07,155 --> 01:22:10,818
- It can freeze anything.
- Even time.

996
01:22:10,892 --> 01:22:14,225
What are you doing?
You're not sending my daughter out there.

997
01:22:14,296 --> 01:22:15,627
Let her out.

998
01:22:16,264 --> 01:22:19,358
Electrical storm headed your way!

999
01:22:19,968 --> 01:22:23,131
- Do you know what to do?
- I believe so.

1000
01:22:23,805 --> 01:22:25,898
Stand back.

1001
01:22:32,948 --> 01:22:35,678
Oh, who do we have here?

1002
01:22:38,787 --> 01:22:42,245
Get ready for the mega-hurts!

1003
01:22:43,825 --> 01:22:46,760
Get it? Hertz?

1004
01:22:46,828 --> 01:22:49,661
As in the unit of electrical frequency?

1005
01:22:53,535 --> 01:22:56,698
You're just not paying attention in class,
are you?

1006
01:22:56,771 --> 01:22:58,033
Ooh!

1007
01:23:06,047 --> 01:23:08,845
Whoa! Awesome!

1008
01:23:08,917 --> 01:23:11,147
He's unplugged.

1009
01:23:11,219 --> 01:23:13,449
Yeah!

1010
01:23:27,936 --> 01:23:32,134
- You made me a great teacher today.
- How did I do that?

1011
01:23:32,207 --> 01:23:36,007
A great teacher learns as much
from his students as they do from him.

1012
01:23:36,077 --> 01:23:40,036
You have... awakened me.

1013
01:23:40,849 --> 01:23:42,680
Thank you, Max.

1014
01:24:10,311 --> 01:24:12,176
Max.

1015
01:24:12,247 --> 01:24:14,545
Your report, please.

1016
01:24:23,691 --> 01:24:26,683
The following story is true.

1017
01:24:27,295 --> 01:24:29,695
It might have started as a dream,

1018
01:24:29,764 --> 01:24:34,292
but, as we saw yesterday,
when we make our dreams a reality...

1019
01:24:34,836 --> 01:24:38,033
reality becomes a dream.

1020
01:24:38,873 --> 01:24:41,933
<i>Sharkboy lives his dream</i>
<i>as king of the ocean,</i>

1021
01:24:42,010 --> 01:24:44,979
<i>where he cares for all its creatures. </i>

1022
01:24:45,046 --> 01:24:49,312
<i>He searches for his father's submarine</i>
<i>where there is no light -</i>

1023
01:24:49,384 --> 01:24:54,981
<i>except in one place, where light shines</i>
<i>almost as bright as the sun. </i>

1024
01:24:55,056 --> 01:24:57,581
<i>It's where Lavagirl lives her dream,</i>

1025
01:24:57,692 --> 01:25:02,186
<i>as queen of Earth's volcanoes</i>
<i>that boil at the bottom of the sea,</i>

1026
01:25:02,230 --> 01:25:04,960
<i>a force of life for all living things. </i>

1027
01:25:06,434 --> 01:25:09,267
<i>Sharkboy and Lavagirl</i>
<i>don't visit me anymore. </i>

1028
01:25:12,173 --> 01:25:15,973
<i>But I can visit them - in my dreams. </i>

1029
01:25:17,045 --> 01:25:19,741
<i>So dream a better dream... </i>

1030
01:25:20,849 --> 01:25:23,613
<i>then work to make it real. </i>

1031
01:25:24,652 --> 01:25:26,643
Yes?

1032
01:25:36,644 --> 01:25:39,444
