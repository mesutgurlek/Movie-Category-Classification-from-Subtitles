1
00:00:01,126 --> 00:00:03,127
Previously on Marvel's
Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D...

2
00:00:03,628 --> 00:00:05,337
Chasing us
is a waste of resources, General.

3
00:00:05,422 --> 00:00:06,422
We're the good guys.

4
00:00:06,506 --> 00:00:07,965
What's your assessment
of Hartley's people?

5
00:00:08,049 --> 00:00:09,425
They're mercenaries,
here for the money.

6
00:00:09,509 --> 00:00:11,427
The enemy has the
advantage. We need one of our own.

7
00:00:11,511 --> 00:00:12,761
You risked that for a Quinjet?

8
00:00:12,846 --> 00:00:14,847
For what we can do
with one. Disappear.

9
00:00:14,931 --> 00:00:16,390
Fitz said he could engineer cloaking,

10
00:00:16,474 --> 00:00:19,226
but the damage to his temporal lobe
was too extensive.

11
00:00:19,310 --> 00:00:21,228
Since Simmons left,
he's only getting worse.

12
00:00:21,312 --> 00:00:22,896
Talking to himself more and more.

13
00:00:22,981 --> 00:00:25,357
It's notjust an 084. It's the first.

14
00:00:25,442 --> 00:00:28,235
And all Fury knew about
was the trail of bodies that follows it.

15
00:00:53,803 --> 00:00:55,304
Hey, Idaho.

16
00:00:56,306 --> 00:00:58,057
Idaho, can you hear me?

17
00:01:02,812 --> 00:01:04,855
Come on, damn it, come on!

18
00:01:21,414 --> 00:01:23,540
Creel's on foot. But he won't be for long.

19
00:01:23,625 --> 00:01:25,793
- Hartley and Idaho?
- Dead.

20
00:01:28,838 --> 00:01:30,172
There's no use. It's jammed.

21
00:01:30,256 --> 00:01:31,757
We have to get you out of here.

22
00:01:31,841 --> 00:01:34,051
My leg is pinned. Don't worry about me.
There's no time.

23
00:01:34,135 --> 00:01:35,135
Soldiers are coming.

24
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:38,555
Creel has the damn thing that burned
Hartley. You need to get him. Go!

25
00:01:41,684 --> 00:01:43,185
Good luck.

26
00:02:02,539 --> 00:02:05,332
Hands on your head! On your knees!

27
00:02:18,054 --> 00:02:19,471
What the hell was Hunter thinking?

28
00:02:19,556 --> 00:02:21,306
He was trying to save Hartley.

29
00:02:21,391 --> 00:02:22,641
And you're absolutely sure?

30
00:02:22,725 --> 00:02:25,435
They're gone. It was bad, Coulson.

31
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:27,729
Two agents down, another captured.

32
00:02:27,814 --> 00:02:28,981
This shouldn't have happened.

33
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:33,735
We got a hit. 911 just picked up
a stolen vehicle call

34
00:02:33,862 --> 00:02:35,070
up the road from you.

35
00:02:35,155 --> 00:02:37,322
Older model, red and white pickup.

36
00:02:37,407 --> 00:02:38,824
That's got to be Creel.

37
00:02:38,908 --> 00:02:41,869
May, you're approaching a civilian area
without backup.

38
00:02:42,203 --> 00:02:43,912
Do not engage, you copy?

39
00:02:44,581 --> 00:02:45,706
Do you copy?

40
00:02:50,503 --> 00:02:52,171
May, that doesn't sound covert.

41
00:02:53,006 --> 00:02:54,506
I've got him. Closing in.

42
00:02:55,925 --> 00:02:59,595
No, drop back. Do not engage.
I repeat, do not engage.

43
00:03:00,013 --> 00:03:02,347
He's not looking. I have a shot.

44
00:03:02,432 --> 00:03:04,850
- Negative!
- We can't just let him go, Coulson.

45
00:03:04,934 --> 00:03:07,853
Creel isn't working alone,
and I wanna know who he answers to.

46
00:03:07,937 --> 00:03:10,314
Drop back into
surveillance mode, now.

47
00:03:10,398 --> 00:03:12,191
That's an order, Agent May!

48
00:03:13,943 --> 00:03:15,652
Yes, sir.

49
00:03:29,417 --> 00:03:31,877
I still can't raise Hunter or Hartley
on the comms.

50
00:03:31,961 --> 00:03:35,255
Not surprised.
Radio silence on the op is protocol.

51
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:37,382
Still, Hartley was in pretty bad shape
when we left her.

52
00:03:37,467 --> 00:03:39,176
You'd think we'd have heard something
by now.

53
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:42,512
No need to think the worst till it shakes
your hand and says, "Hello."

54
00:03:42,597 --> 00:03:44,056
Is that another one
of your grandma's sayings?

55
00:03:45,308 --> 00:03:48,602
Fortune cookie. I had some
Kung Pao chicken the other night.

56
00:03:48,686 --> 00:03:50,270
Maybe Coulson's heard from them.

57
00:03:50,355 --> 00:03:53,273
We need a complete inventory
by the time Agent Koenig returns.

58
00:03:53,358 --> 00:03:55,817
- Food, fuel, and ammo. Understood?
- Yes, sir.

59
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:59,238
You got the Quinjet. Well done.

60
00:03:59,322 --> 00:04:00,405
Thank you, sir.

61
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:01,657
Any word about Hartley?

62
00:04:01,741 --> 00:04:03,408
Not now.

63
00:04:03,493 --> 00:04:04,743
Let Mack know the jet's here.

64
00:04:04,827 --> 00:04:07,204
I want him reverse-engineering
that cloaking hardware right away.

65
00:04:07,288 --> 00:04:09,539
Sooner he does, sooner we get the bus
operational again.

66
00:04:09,624 --> 00:04:10,791
Roger that.

67
00:04:16,089 --> 00:04:17,756
Something else?

68
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:20,342
The item that messed up Hartley's arm?

69
00:04:20,426 --> 00:04:23,595
It had those weird symbols on it.
The ones you've had me researching.

70
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25,264
The same symbols?

71
00:04:25,348 --> 00:04:26,390
- You sure?
- Yes.

72
00:04:26,474 --> 00:04:29,101
They came up out of the object.
It reminded me of Braille.

73
00:04:29,185 --> 00:04:31,853
It was like Hartley triggered something
by touching it.

74
00:04:31,938 --> 00:04:32,980
What the hell is that thing?

75
00:04:33,064 --> 00:04:35,857
I have no idea. But good work.

76
00:04:35,942 --> 00:04:36,984
"Good work"?

77
00:04:38,111 --> 00:04:40,320
How about, "Holy crap, Skye,
we gotta get on that"?

78
00:04:40,405 --> 00:04:43,323
After a month of combing the planet
for these things, we finally got a clue...

79
00:04:43,408 --> 00:04:45,701
Right now,
we have more important problems.

80
00:04:45,785 --> 00:04:48,078
A five-alarm fire,
otherwise known as Lance Hunter.

81
00:04:49,497 --> 00:04:50,747
- Is he...
- Captured.

82
00:04:50,832 --> 00:04:53,750
But if he talks,
our entire operation's compromised.

83
00:04:53,835 --> 00:04:55,502
We'll have to burn the base
and evacuate.

84
00:04:56,713 --> 00:04:59,214
I know.
And we just retiled the bathrooms.

85
00:05:13,479 --> 00:05:15,689
Oh, just as I was dropping off to sleep.

86
00:05:17,984 --> 00:05:19,443
Thank you very much.

87
00:05:22,155 --> 00:05:23,864
Excuse me, gents, can I get a glass of

88
00:05:27,994 --> 00:05:29,369
water?

89
00:05:47,055 --> 00:05:49,848
Mr. Hunter. I don't believe
we've had the pleasure.

90
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:52,601
Brigadier General Glenn Talbot.

91
00:05:58,274 --> 00:05:59,608
Looks like you need a lift, soldier.

92
00:06:10,036 --> 00:06:12,371
- So this is cloaking hardware?
- Uh-huh.

93
00:06:12,955 --> 00:06:14,706
Let's take a peek under the hood.

94
00:06:17,585 --> 00:06:19,711
Fitz would be crushed if he saw this.

95
00:06:19,796 --> 00:06:22,381
He's been working on cloaking
since before Simmons took off.

96
00:06:22,465 --> 00:06:24,216
Still can't believe
she abandoned him like that.

97
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:25,550
She abandoned all of us.

98
00:06:25,635 --> 00:06:28,053
But Fitz has been clinging to his work
like a lifeline.

99
00:06:28,137 --> 00:06:29,471
Maybe we shouldn't tell him.

100
00:06:29,555 --> 00:06:31,473
Coulson wants
a retro version of this for the bus.

101
00:06:31,557 --> 00:06:34,309
He said that no one knows the avionics
on this thing like Fitz.

102
00:06:34,394 --> 00:06:35,894
Think he can handle it?

103
00:06:35,978 --> 00:06:37,145
I don't know. Why don't you ask him?

104
00:06:40,483 --> 00:06:43,193
- Hey, Fitz.
- Hey. What's up, man?

105
00:06:43,277 --> 00:06:44,277
How are you?

106
00:06:45,321 --> 00:06:46,780
So, that's the, um...

107
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:48,740
That's the...

108
00:06:48,825 --> 00:06:51,410
Cloaking. In all its glory.

109
00:06:52,495 --> 00:06:55,080
You know, you weren't that far off.
Check out the transmitter core.

110
00:06:55,164 --> 00:06:58,250
Yeah, to negate the resonant, the...

111
00:06:58,668 --> 00:06:59,918
The resonant?

112
00:07:00,628 --> 00:07:01,670
No. Um...

113
00:07:04,715 --> 00:07:06,425
It's okay. Just take your time.

114
00:07:08,302 --> 00:07:09,553
What he's trying to say is,

115
00:07:09,637 --> 00:07:12,931
there's an audio component to cloaking
that inverts sound waves.

116
00:07:13,015 --> 00:07:14,349
Like noise-canceling headphones?

117
00:07:14,434 --> 00:07:16,560
- Yeah. Same concept.
- Okay.

118
00:07:16,644 --> 00:07:19,438
Think you can give me a hand
with this?

119
00:07:20,356 --> 00:07:23,442
Um, under the circumstances... Uh...

120
00:07:23,526 --> 00:07:26,695
Well, the trick is, you would...

121
00:07:28,197 --> 00:07:30,532
The trick would be in the metamaterials.

122
00:07:34,328 --> 00:07:37,372
Uh... Oh, yeah.
But you'd have to alter the, um...

123
00:07:41,419 --> 00:07:42,461
Fitz...

124
00:07:42,545 --> 00:07:46,339
Oh, yeah, could everyone just stop
talking for one second?

125
00:07:47,884 --> 00:07:49,509
No, sorry. I'm gonna have to go.

126
00:07:54,307 --> 00:07:56,975
It's like sometimes he's the same
old Fitz, and other times...

127
00:07:57,059 --> 00:07:58,226
Not.

128
00:07:58,311 --> 00:07:59,811
I'll take your word for it.

129
00:07:59,896 --> 00:08:02,564
In the meantime, I'm still gonna need
an extra pair of hands.

130
00:08:02,648 --> 00:08:03,857
Is everyone back from the mission?

131
00:08:05,318 --> 00:08:06,568
Not everyone.

132
00:08:12,575 --> 00:08:15,243
Sierra Leone, three years ago.
Ring a bell?

133
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:21,791
How about Basra, '08?
Operation Panther's Claw.

134
00:08:21,876 --> 00:08:25,045
Come on, Lieutenant.
Tell me the stories are true.

135
00:08:25,129 --> 00:08:27,047
I'm not a lieutenant anymore, sir.

136
00:08:27,131 --> 00:08:28,673
Why is that, son?

137
00:08:28,758 --> 00:08:32,219
With your record, five commendations
for distinguished service?

138
00:08:32,303 --> 00:08:35,013
Merits for basket weaving, pottery.
Don't forget those.

139
00:08:35,097 --> 00:08:39,059
Just trying to figure out how a guy
like you, one of the SAS's finest,

140
00:08:39,143 --> 00:08:42,896
winds up running with a bunch
of mouth-breathing mercs.

141
00:08:43,397 --> 00:08:45,106
Why does any man do anything,
General?

142
00:08:46,192 --> 00:08:47,526
I met a girl.

143
00:08:50,238 --> 00:08:52,614
Look, Hunter,
I think we're pretty like-minded guys,

144
00:08:52,698 --> 00:08:54,616
so let's not waste each other's time.

145
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:55,825
You know what I'm after.

146
00:08:56,369 --> 00:08:57,911
Guessing it's not Carl Creel?

147
00:08:57,995 --> 00:09:00,664
Creel's small-time. Think big fish.

148
00:09:00,748 --> 00:09:02,874
Coulson.

149
00:09:04,418 --> 00:09:05,794
He's a vigilante.

150
00:09:06,629 --> 00:09:09,256
A zealot who will risk anything
to further his own agenda.

151
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:14,052
But lucky for you, I've got a senator
with very deep pockets that wants him.

152
00:09:14,136 --> 00:09:16,471
So you go ahead. Name your price.

153
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:18,765
You must be joking.

154
00:09:18,849 --> 00:09:21,142
I don't have a sense of humor.

155
00:09:21,227 --> 00:09:23,937
And if I don't give you Coulson, what?

156
00:09:24,021 --> 00:09:25,188
I go for a swim?

157
00:09:26,816 --> 00:09:29,359
You should know I've been "helped"
out of a chopper before, sir.

158
00:09:29,443 --> 00:09:32,571
Coulson broke into
a secure government facility.

159
00:09:32,655 --> 00:09:34,906
He let a psychopath on the loose,

160
00:09:34,991 --> 00:09:39,244
sacrificed the lives of his own men,
your friends. For what?

161
00:09:41,289 --> 00:09:44,666
Hunter, I'm not here to play bad cop.

162
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:45,875
I shouldn't have to.

163
00:09:50,006 --> 00:09:52,132
- I want two million.
- Done.

164
00:09:52,216 --> 00:09:53,425
And a proper burial.

165
00:09:54,927 --> 00:09:56,511
- Excuse me?
- For Hartley.

166
00:09:56,596 --> 00:09:57,679
She's a S.H.I.E.L.D. agent.

167
00:09:57,763 --> 00:09:59,806
She'll be branded a terrorist
after what you said on TV.

168
00:09:59,890 --> 00:10:01,182
Probably dumped in a pauper's grave,

169
00:10:01,267 --> 00:10:03,602
her family wondering
what happened to her.

170
00:10:04,186 --> 00:10:05,395
They deserve better.

171
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:10,567
She deserves better.
I'll make sure she gets it.

172
00:10:29,045 --> 00:10:30,253
Hmm.

173
00:10:35,676 --> 00:10:37,052
Keep an eye out for this.

174
00:10:51,817 --> 00:10:54,277
I just wanted to report that Mack
and Trip are working on cloaking.

175
00:10:54,362 --> 00:10:56,946
So I'm free if you want me back
in the field.

176
00:10:57,031 --> 00:10:59,741
That won't be necessary.
May's still out there.

177
00:10:59,825 --> 00:11:01,076
What about Hartley and Idaho?

178
00:11:10,503 --> 00:11:11,670
They're not out there, are they?

179
00:11:19,387 --> 00:11:21,012
It was that thing, wasn't it? The object?

180
00:11:21,097 --> 00:11:22,222
It was Creel.

181
00:11:23,516 --> 00:11:26,810
Sir, I need to get back out there
and help May take him down.

182
00:11:26,894 --> 00:11:28,895
- No.
- She's my S.O.

183
00:11:28,979 --> 00:11:31,064
I'm a field agent now,
and I can handle myself.

184
00:11:31,148 --> 00:11:32,315
That's not what this is about.

185
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:36,152
Then what is it about? The object?
The symbols?

186
00:11:36,237 --> 00:11:38,530
Because I can't help
if I don't know what's going on.

187
00:11:42,201 --> 00:11:46,705
If you'd like to help, go down to
the bunks, pack up Hartley's things.

188
00:11:50,167 --> 00:11:51,334
Okay.

189
00:11:57,174 --> 00:12:00,176
I know you're the boss, and you have to
compartmentalize everything.

190
00:12:00,261 --> 00:12:01,511
But it's not healthy.

191
00:12:01,595 --> 00:12:03,138
You need to loosen up.

192
00:12:03,806 --> 00:12:06,433
Try yoga or something.

193
00:12:08,978 --> 00:12:11,980
I tried it, but I'm really not flexible.

194
00:12:15,609 --> 00:12:17,110
But thanks.

195
00:12:17,945 --> 00:12:20,530
We were so close.

196
00:12:20,614 --> 00:12:25,076
If they'd just given us a little bit
more time to calculate the object's...

197
00:12:25,161 --> 00:12:26,661
Refractive index, yeah.

198
00:12:26,746 --> 00:12:30,039
That's the problem these days.
Everyone needs answers immediately.

199
00:12:30,124 --> 00:12:31,958
No one has any patience anymore.

200
00:12:33,377 --> 00:12:34,419
Yeah.

201
00:12:34,503 --> 00:12:37,714
I bet they're relishing the fact that
we couldn't crack the cloaking device.

202
00:12:37,798 --> 00:12:39,674
Don't be silly, Fitz.

203
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:42,218
Everyone here knows how valuable
you are to the team.

204
00:12:42,928 --> 00:12:45,346
Well, they avoid me like the plague.

205
00:12:46,348 --> 00:12:48,099
They do not.

206
00:12:48,184 --> 00:12:50,518
They just have their own problems
right now.

207
00:12:51,103 --> 00:12:53,730
Oh, yeah. The Creel business.

208
00:12:53,814 --> 00:12:56,483
In fact, perhaps they need
our assistance

209
00:12:56,567 --> 00:12:58,985
if they're looking for a way
to neutralize Creel's ability.

210
00:12:59,653 --> 00:13:01,446
No one has our experience with Gifteds.

211
00:13:01,530 --> 00:13:03,698
Of course, we can't just hijack
the project from them.

212
00:13:03,783 --> 00:13:05,617
That would shatter their confidence.

213
00:13:05,701 --> 00:13:07,994
- Yeah, no. Do not wanna do that.
- No.

214
00:13:08,913 --> 00:13:10,997
- Or do we?
- Fitz.

215
00:13:11,081 --> 00:13:13,750
Yeah, no. No. Stupid, silly idea.
I don't know why I...

216
00:13:13,834 --> 00:13:15,210
Hey. Look!

217
00:13:16,754 --> 00:13:19,672
There's a whole packet of research
they just left laying about,

218
00:13:19,757 --> 00:13:22,592
all willy-nilly for anyone to see.

219
00:13:25,805 --> 00:13:27,555
It's Creel's DNA results.

220
00:13:28,349 --> 00:13:31,768
Interesting! Shall we see
what we can do with these?

221
00:13:32,895 --> 00:13:34,521
Yes, we shall, Simmons.

222
00:13:34,730 --> 00:13:36,064
Yes, we shall.

223
00:13:48,619 --> 00:13:50,870
You all good, hon?
Are you still waiting on a friend?

224
00:13:50,955 --> 00:13:52,038
Yeah, I'm still waiting.

225
00:13:52,122 --> 00:13:55,917
All right, then, no hurry.
Here, let me clear that. Excuse me.

226
00:13:59,421 --> 00:14:02,507
I'm sorry. I think I got a shock.

227
00:14:03,467 --> 00:14:05,510
Static electricity or something.

228
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:17,355
What's the status on Creel?

229
00:14:17,439 --> 00:14:19,190
He's been in there for over an hour.

230
00:14:19,275 --> 00:14:22,902
Either he's waiting for a drop,
or he's getting drunk off his ass.

231
00:14:24,154 --> 00:14:25,905
Something's happening, Coulson.
I'm going in.

232
00:14:30,327 --> 00:14:31,452
Everybody, get back!

233
00:14:31,537 --> 00:14:33,705
I don't know what happened!
All she did was touch the guy.

234
00:14:33,789 --> 00:14:35,540
Then he took off.

235
00:14:35,624 --> 00:14:37,792
- Help me.
- Hang on.

236
00:14:48,721 --> 00:14:50,346
All the woman did was touch his arm.

237
00:14:50,431 --> 00:14:53,600
We know that Creel absorbs
the properties of whatever he touches.

238
00:14:53,684 --> 00:14:56,185
He must've absorbed the Obelisk
and its deadly powers.

239
00:14:56,270 --> 00:14:57,395
But why hurt a waitress?

240
00:14:57,479 --> 00:14:58,646
I don't think it was intentional.

241
00:14:58,731 --> 00:15:00,189
You're saying he's losing control?

242
00:15:00,274 --> 00:15:02,734
He had some control issues when
S.H.I.E.L.D. first came across him.

243
00:15:02,818 --> 00:15:05,612
If that's what's happening,
anyone near him is at risk.

244
00:15:05,696 --> 00:15:07,447
I should've engaged
when I had the chance.

245
00:15:07,531 --> 00:15:10,241
Then you'd be dead, too.
If this is on anyone...

246
00:15:10,826 --> 00:15:13,578
Just because you're Director,
doesn't mean everything's on you, Phil.

247
00:15:13,662 --> 00:15:17,582
Yes, it does. Go dark.
Get back when you can.

248
00:15:21,295 --> 00:15:22,337
Now what?

249
00:15:34,433 --> 00:15:37,810
Nice ride. Some rich guy loan it to you?

250
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:41,606
Yeah, something like that.
Shame about the rims, though, eh?

251
00:15:41,690 --> 00:15:43,900
Yeah. Probably cost a grand each.

252
00:15:43,984 --> 00:15:45,443
- At least.
- Mmm.

253
00:15:45,527 --> 00:15:47,236
This isn't a friendly stop, is it?

254
00:15:47,321 --> 00:15:48,738
Nope. Hands on the car.

255
00:15:50,908 --> 00:15:52,116
How the hell
did you lose him?

256
00:15:52,201 --> 00:15:54,953
Why haven't you got every agent
out there looking for Creel right now?

257
00:15:55,037 --> 00:15:56,454
You think you're entitled to answers?

258
00:15:56,538 --> 00:15:58,706
He killed two of my friends.
I think that's entitlement enough.

259
00:15:58,791 --> 00:16:01,250
- Well, it's not.
- You should've aborted the mission.

260
00:16:01,335 --> 00:16:02,877
Hartley should've followed my orders.

261
00:16:11,804 --> 00:16:13,221
Yeah, well, she tried to.

262
00:16:14,181 --> 00:16:16,182
Izzy's only mistake was listening to me.

263
00:16:16,266 --> 00:16:18,518
Is that why you came back?

264
00:16:18,602 --> 00:16:20,937
Guilt? A desire for revenge?

265
00:16:21,897 --> 00:16:24,065
Or was it because of
what Talbot promised you?

266
00:16:24,608 --> 00:16:25,692
All of the above.

267
00:16:25,776 --> 00:16:26,818
So you took the deal?

268
00:16:26,902 --> 00:16:28,695
I have 48 hours to deliver you.

269
00:16:28,779 --> 00:16:29,862
Or else you're a dead man.

270
00:16:30,656 --> 00:16:32,240
Words to that effect, yeah.

271
00:16:32,324 --> 00:16:35,410
Talbot. And you didn't give him
our location?

272
00:16:35,494 --> 00:16:37,120
Don't get me wrong, I thought about it.

273
00:16:37,204 --> 00:16:39,539
He put a four-man detail on me.
Took three hours to shake them.

274
00:16:39,623 --> 00:16:41,666
I could've led them right to your door.

275
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:43,334
So kind of you to reconsider.

276
00:16:43,419 --> 00:16:45,461
And in exchange for me,
you get what exactly?

277
00:16:46,130 --> 00:16:48,131
A proper burial for Isabelle Hartley.

278
00:16:48,215 --> 00:16:49,799
I wanted to make sure
her record was cleared,

279
00:16:49,883 --> 00:16:51,884
that her family were properly notified.

280
00:16:51,969 --> 00:16:54,137
Really? That's all?

281
00:16:54,221 --> 00:16:57,306
Look, between you and Talbot,
I know you'll get to Creel first.

282
00:16:57,391 --> 00:16:59,267
He's the only thing I want.

283
00:16:59,351 --> 00:17:00,852
Well, that and the money you owe me.

284
00:17:00,936 --> 00:17:03,396
You're kidding, right?
'Cause sometimes I can't tell.

285
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:06,065
Mmm, no, I'm not. I want my pay.

286
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:08,359
And not just mine, either.
I want Hartley's and Idaho's, too.

287
00:17:08,444 --> 00:17:09,610
Okay, now you're kidding.

288
00:17:09,695 --> 00:17:10,820
It's for their families.

289
00:17:10,904 --> 00:17:14,032
I think they deserve something
for their loss, don't you think?

290
00:17:16,910 --> 00:17:17,994
I'll take care of it.

291
00:17:18,495 --> 00:17:23,249
Good. Once we have Creel,
I'll be in the wind.

292
00:17:24,168 --> 00:17:25,334
Or three sheets to it.

293
00:17:28,505 --> 00:17:30,548
Why are they going
the biochemical route?

294
00:17:30,632 --> 00:17:33,968
They're using an adenovirus vector
to counter Creel's ability.

295
00:17:34,053 --> 00:17:37,180
Yeah. Well, it's pointless, really,
since the injected, um...

296
00:17:37,264 --> 00:17:40,099
Injected vector will never bind
to his cellular membranes.

297
00:17:40,184 --> 00:17:44,020
Yeah. So, well, then they'd have to
find a way to destabilize the...

298
00:17:44,104 --> 00:17:46,814
The molecular structure
of Creel's epidermal cells, yeah.

299
00:17:50,944 --> 00:17:51,986
Destabilize!

300
00:17:53,155 --> 00:17:54,155
Oh...

301
00:17:55,657 --> 00:17:57,533
I... I didn't solve this today.

302
00:17:58,786 --> 00:17:59,744
Who are you talking to?

303
00:17:59,828 --> 00:18:01,287
- What? No one.
- Me.

304
00:18:01,371 --> 00:18:04,457
Yeah, you like talking to yourself.
It's cool. Lot of people do.

305
00:18:04,541 --> 00:18:06,751
You know, I like singing in the shower.

306
00:18:06,835 --> 00:18:08,127
Yeah, I know,
it's not really the same thing

307
00:18:08,212 --> 00:18:09,754
but I wouldn't want anyone to hear it.

308
00:18:13,383 --> 00:18:14,467
What do you want?

309
00:18:16,428 --> 00:18:19,806
For cloaking, were you thinking about
putting it under avionics or...

310
00:18:19,890 --> 00:18:23,851
Enough about cloaking.
I'm busy with something.

311
00:18:26,939 --> 00:18:30,066
Sounds like you're just blowing me off.
You wanna be alone? That's cool.

312
00:18:30,692 --> 00:18:33,778
You know, I think I like him.
He's honest.

313
00:18:34,863 --> 00:18:35,863
Blunt, I'd say.

314
00:18:35,948 --> 00:18:37,115
I call them like I see them.

315
00:18:37,199 --> 00:18:38,449
No, he doesn't talk to you
like the others.

316
00:18:38,534 --> 00:18:40,159
It's quite refreshing, actually.

317
00:18:40,244 --> 00:18:41,911
Yo, Fitz.

318
00:18:41,995 --> 00:18:42,995
Your mind go wandering again?

319
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:44,747
- What? No.
- See?

320
00:18:45,415 --> 00:18:46,541
What do you got there?

321
00:18:46,625 --> 00:18:47,792
This is just...

322
00:18:47,876 --> 00:18:49,669
Go ahead and show him.
What harm would it do?

323
00:18:49,753 --> 00:18:52,171
Does it have something to do
with stopping Creel?

324
00:18:53,257 --> 00:18:55,675
Yeah. I think.

325
00:18:56,844 --> 00:18:58,928
I think that we're...

326
00:19:00,097 --> 00:19:01,973
I have...

327
00:19:05,394 --> 00:19:06,978
I didn't solve this today.

328
00:19:08,647 --> 00:19:10,356
You think you can?

329
00:19:25,038 --> 00:19:26,122
Izzy's sister, Jane.

330
00:19:31,712 --> 00:19:34,839
Her favorite person in the world.
After me, of course.

331
00:19:34,923 --> 00:19:36,757
Looks like they liked each other.

332
00:19:36,842 --> 00:19:37,925
Yeah. Those two,
when they got together,

333
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:40,928
there was a lot laughs
and bottles of wine.

334
00:19:42,472 --> 00:19:44,390
Izzy was good when it came to family.

335
00:19:45,601 --> 00:19:48,269
Which is why I'm taking this.

336
00:19:49,396 --> 00:19:50,897
Belonged to their mum.

337
00:19:51,231 --> 00:19:53,316
Died of breast cancer
about five years back.

338
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:55,234
Jane has it now, too.

339
00:19:55,903 --> 00:19:57,153
That's awful.

340
00:19:57,571 --> 00:20:00,865
Yeah. Life can be a mean drunk
that way.

341
00:20:01,617 --> 00:20:03,242
Never knows when to stop punching.

342
00:20:04,453 --> 00:20:05,578
How'd you guys meet?

343
00:20:05,662 --> 00:20:07,788
Through my psychotic ex-wife.

344
00:20:07,998 --> 00:20:09,165
Mmm-hmm.

345
00:20:09,917 --> 00:20:11,834
Those two were good friends
back in the day.

346
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:14,754
I'm really sorry.

347
00:20:15,797 --> 00:20:17,298
Tough to lose people you care about.

348
00:20:19,009 --> 00:20:21,594
Secret to that? Don't get attached.

349
00:20:22,262 --> 00:20:23,721
Tried that. Didn't work.

350
00:20:25,098 --> 00:20:26,182
For you either.

351
00:20:31,605 --> 00:20:33,814
You know, you remind me a bit of Izzy.

352
00:20:34,733 --> 00:20:37,443
- Raw but sharp. You got skills.
- Mmm.

353
00:20:37,527 --> 00:20:40,112
Type that could earn you some
real money in the private sector.

354
00:20:40,197 --> 00:20:42,823
As a mercenary? Yeah, I don't think so.

355
00:20:43,367 --> 00:20:46,410
We prefer the term
"private military contractors."

356
00:20:47,204 --> 00:20:50,790
Don't knock it. Everyone needs
an exit strategy eventually.

357
00:20:50,874 --> 00:20:54,043
Not me. S.H.I.E.L.D.'s my life now.

358
00:20:55,045 --> 00:20:57,129
S.H.I.E.L.D. isn't a life.

359
00:20:57,214 --> 00:20:59,924
It's just a job. Means to an end.

360
00:21:01,551 --> 00:21:02,635
Remember that.

361
00:21:04,805 --> 00:21:07,306
You hear anything more about Creel,
let me know.

362
00:22:05,324 --> 00:22:06,324
Who's this?

363
00:22:06,408 --> 00:22:09,035
Good evening, Mr. Creel.
We've been trying to reach you.

364
00:22:09,119 --> 00:22:11,787
Where the hell were you?
I waited at the drop site for an hour.

365
00:22:11,872 --> 00:22:14,498
Calm down, Mr. Creel.
There's no need to panic.

366
00:22:14,583 --> 00:22:16,876
We're being cautious now that
S.H.I.E.L.D. is a factor.

367
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:20,254
Forget them. I got a real problem.
That thing really messed me up.

368
00:22:20,339 --> 00:22:22,089
I turned to rubber when I touched it.

369
00:22:22,174 --> 00:22:25,801
Thought that it would protect me,
but it infected me, too.

370
00:22:25,886 --> 00:22:27,428
We're well aware of your condition.

371
00:22:28,263 --> 00:22:29,388
But believe me when I say

372
00:22:29,473 --> 00:22:31,474
that Mr. Whitehall
wouldn't have selected you for this job

373
00:22:31,558 --> 00:22:33,684
if you weren't capable of completing it.

374
00:22:33,769 --> 00:22:37,104
You don't know what it's doing to me.
I can't keep it off.

375
00:22:37,189 --> 00:22:38,439
Once we have the Obelisk,

376
00:22:38,523 --> 00:22:42,276
you will be taken care of, the way
HYDRA has always taken care of you.

377
00:22:42,361 --> 00:22:44,612
Please proceed
to the secondary drop site

378
00:22:44,696 --> 00:22:47,615
and I shall meet you
at the appropriate time. Good night.

379
00:22:48,283 --> 00:22:49,492
Hello?

380
00:22:52,788 --> 00:22:55,164
What? What are you looking at?

381
00:22:55,248 --> 00:22:56,999
Leave them alone, Mr. Creel.

382
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:02,421
We have far more important things
to discuss.

383
00:23:07,219 --> 00:23:08,469
I know you from somewhere?

384
00:23:09,012 --> 00:23:10,721
My name is Raina.

385
00:23:10,806 --> 00:23:15,851
And I'm a huge admirer
of yours and your gifts.

386
00:23:16,645 --> 00:23:18,312
Beat it, lady, I'm not into groupies.

387
00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:20,481
You misunderstand.

388
00:23:21,525 --> 00:23:26,195
I know you recently acquired something
extremely precious and rare.

389
00:23:26,279 --> 00:23:28,781
Something I'm very interested in.

390
00:23:29,574 --> 00:23:33,077
Whatever you're offering,
it ain't enough.

391
00:23:34,246 --> 00:23:36,247
Maybe not.

392
00:23:36,331 --> 00:23:39,458
But aren't you the least bit curious
as to what it might be?

393
00:23:44,381 --> 00:23:49,385
It's called carbyne. An allotrope
of carbon found in stardust.

394
00:23:49,469 --> 00:23:52,221
Three times harder than diamond.

395
00:23:52,681 --> 00:23:54,515
With an added bonus.

396
00:23:55,183 --> 00:23:56,934
It can store energy.

397
00:23:58,728 --> 00:24:00,146
Beautiful, isn't it?

398
00:24:01,731 --> 00:24:03,732
So filled with potential.

399
00:24:07,404 --> 00:24:08,863
Am I supposed to be impressed?

400
00:24:09,531 --> 00:24:11,115
I'll settle for interested.

401
00:24:16,663 --> 00:24:19,915
You have no idea
who you're dealing with, lady.

402
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,041
You ever hear of HYDRA?

403
00:24:21,543 --> 00:24:22,793
Name rings a bell.

404
00:24:22,878 --> 00:24:25,379
Let me give you a tip. Run.

405
00:24:26,506 --> 00:24:28,382
'Cause if the guy I'm working for
gets a hold of you,

406
00:24:29,009 --> 00:24:32,720
I'd hate to see what he's gonna do
to that pretty little face of yours.

407
00:24:34,055 --> 00:24:36,557
Looks like you need some help there,
Mr. Creel.

408
00:24:38,226 --> 00:24:40,019
I'm not the one who needs help, lady.

409
00:24:41,062 --> 00:24:42,480
You do if you touched the Obelisk.

410
00:24:42,564 --> 00:24:45,900
I'll tell you what. I'm gonna do you
a solid and not tell my boss about you.

411
00:24:45,984 --> 00:24:47,109
What about the carbyne?

412
00:24:47,194 --> 00:24:49,153
It's the cost of doing business.

413
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:53,407
He couldn't have gone far.

414
00:24:53,492 --> 00:24:56,076
Local authorities have his description.
Road blocks are up.

415
00:24:56,161 --> 00:24:57,453
Talbot's people are still out there.

416
00:24:57,537 --> 00:24:59,121
Why was Creel at the bar?

417
00:24:59,206 --> 00:25:00,331
He was waiting for someone.

418
00:25:00,415 --> 00:25:01,916
We just don't know
if that person ever showed.

419
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,502
We need a solve for Creel's powers
and we need it yesterday.

420
00:25:04,586 --> 00:25:06,837
- How's the lab coming?
- Nothing yet.

421
00:25:06,922 --> 00:25:09,298
You remember that encrypted
HYDRA frequency we shut down?

422
00:25:09,382 --> 00:25:11,008
Well, it's back up.

423
00:25:11,092 --> 00:25:12,343
Someone sent a message.

424
00:25:12,427 --> 00:25:14,845
A message for us
with a phone number to call.

425
00:25:14,930 --> 00:25:15,930
Yeah, it could be Creel.

426
00:25:16,014 --> 00:25:18,641
Creel? A phone number?
What, is he lonely?

427
00:25:18,725 --> 00:25:19,934
I doubt it, the guy's jacked.

428
00:25:20,018 --> 00:25:23,270
And he can turn any body part
into any material.

429
00:25:23,355 --> 00:25:24,647
- Okay, thank you for that.
- Mmm-hmm.

430
00:25:24,731 --> 00:25:25,940
- Call the number.
- Okay.

431
00:25:30,111 --> 00:25:31,987
- Hello?
- Who is this?

432
00:25:32,072 --> 00:25:35,241
Agent Coulson!
I'm glad you got my message.

433
00:25:35,325 --> 00:25:37,701
Raina! As I live and breathe.

434
00:25:37,786 --> 00:25:39,370
Been a while
since we've spoken.

435
00:25:39,454 --> 00:25:41,997
I'm kind of in the middle of a manhunt.
Can we make this quick?

436
00:25:42,082 --> 00:25:45,417
Why? You need time to trace this call,
don't you?

437
00:25:46,878 --> 00:25:50,172
I take it then you haven't tracked down
Mr. Creel or the item he stole?

438
00:25:50,257 --> 00:25:51,715
What do you know about that?

439
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:53,634
I know
HYDRA's about to get their hands on it.

440
00:25:53,718 --> 00:25:55,135
Congratulations.

441
00:25:55,804 --> 00:25:57,388
Let me be clear.

442
00:25:57,472 --> 00:26:00,266
Mr. Creel is working for HYDRA,
I am not.

443
00:26:00,976 --> 00:26:03,143
Why the breakup? Bad dental plan?

444
00:26:03,228 --> 00:26:07,314
HYDRA only has one thing
on their minds. World domination.

445
00:26:07,399 --> 00:26:09,233
Which is so 1945.

446
00:26:09,317 --> 00:26:10,401
What do you want, Raina?

447
00:26:10,485 --> 00:26:12,152
It's what I don't want.

448
00:26:12,237 --> 00:26:13,988
Which is the Obelisk
falling into the hands of people

449
00:26:14,072 --> 00:26:16,031
who don't understand it.

450
00:26:16,116 --> 00:26:17,324
I'm thinking you might.

451
00:26:17,409 --> 00:26:19,159
And I'm thinking
you're gonna tell me why.

452
00:26:19,244 --> 00:26:20,911
John Garrett understood it.

453
00:26:20,996 --> 00:26:24,665
The moment he was injected
with the same drug that saved you,

454
00:26:24,749 --> 00:26:26,542
he had visions.

455
00:26:26,626 --> 00:26:28,752
He started carving those visions
into the walls.

456
00:26:30,005 --> 00:26:31,088
Garrett was a madman.

457
00:26:31,172 --> 00:26:32,715
Garrett was enlightened.

458
00:26:32,799 --> 00:26:35,843
He witnessed our fate.
What we become.

459
00:26:37,596 --> 00:26:38,762
Have you?

460
00:26:38,847 --> 00:26:42,808
You're not calling to talk about fate.
You want us to catch Creel.

461
00:26:45,020 --> 00:26:48,063
You read my mind, Agent Coulson.

462
00:26:48,148 --> 00:26:50,899
Truth is,
Mr. Creel stole something from me.

463
00:26:50,984 --> 00:26:54,570
Fortunately, for the both of us,
it has an embedded tracker.

464
00:26:54,654 --> 00:26:58,365
But you'd better hurry.
He's growing less stable by the second.

465
00:26:59,659 --> 00:27:01,201
The moment that tracker's
frequency comes through,

466
00:27:01,286 --> 00:27:02,953
I want everyone on the move.

467
00:27:03,038 --> 00:27:04,371
If Creel's handing off the item
to HYDRA,

468
00:27:04,456 --> 00:27:05,581
we need to see where that leads.

469
00:27:05,665 --> 00:27:06,790
What if Creel melts down again?

470
00:27:06,875 --> 00:27:09,126
The lab hasn't figured out
how to shut down his powers yet.

471
00:27:09,210 --> 00:27:12,129
If he's an immediate threat to civilians,
Trip's got the backup plan.

472
00:27:12,213 --> 00:27:13,297
What kind of backup plan?

473
00:27:13,381 --> 00:27:16,300
The heavy-duty kind.
With armor-piercing rounds.

474
00:27:16,384 --> 00:27:17,468
Will that work?

475
00:27:17,552 --> 00:27:19,553
We get close enough to him,
catch him off guard.

476
00:27:20,305 --> 00:27:21,639
Hopefully we won't have to find out.

477
00:27:22,891 --> 00:27:24,016
Where do you want me?

478
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:27,895
That depends. Can you follow an order?

479
00:27:27,979 --> 00:27:29,146
Absolutely, sir.

480
00:27:29,230 --> 00:27:31,231
Because part of me wants you here
running backend.

481
00:27:31,316 --> 00:27:32,900
The other part knows
we need boots on the ground,

482
00:27:32,984 --> 00:27:34,485
and I've only got a few good pairs.

483
00:27:34,569 --> 00:27:36,570
I'll be good. Scout's honor.

484
00:27:40,742 --> 00:27:42,701
Please, sir. I owe Hartley one.

485
00:27:46,665 --> 00:27:47,748
We could use him.

486
00:27:48,708 --> 00:27:49,833
Suit up.

487
00:27:54,422 --> 00:27:58,759
It's all about the... The resonant.

488
00:28:02,597 --> 00:28:04,181
I didn't solve this today.

489
00:28:04,265 --> 00:28:07,267
What is this, some kind of sonic thing
like the cloaking device?

490
00:28:07,352 --> 00:28:08,686
No! I didn't...

491
00:28:08,770 --> 00:28:11,689
Forget about the cloaking device.
No one's blaming you for that.

492
00:28:11,773 --> 00:28:14,066
But right now we've just got to focus
on taking down Creel.

493
00:28:15,944 --> 00:28:18,445
Whoa, whoa, calm the hell down.

494
00:28:18,530 --> 00:28:20,072
Hey, beat it! You pissed him off.

495
00:28:21,449 --> 00:28:22,866
Okay.

496
00:28:22,951 --> 00:28:25,119
- Take it easy.
- Look, I didn't solve this today!

497
00:28:25,245 --> 00:28:27,162
Yeah, I know! You said that already!

498
00:28:27,247 --> 00:28:29,498
I didn't solve this today.

499
00:28:31,751 --> 00:28:35,254
Wait, are you saying you didn't solve
this today, but you solved this before?

500
00:28:36,089 --> 00:28:37,297
Yes.

501
00:28:37,966 --> 00:28:39,258
You're looking for an old design?

502
00:28:39,342 --> 00:28:41,719
Yes! Yeah. Yeah.

503
00:28:41,803 --> 00:28:45,055
All right, okay. All right. I'm with ya.

504
00:28:45,140 --> 00:28:46,807
- Yeah.
- I'm with you, Turbo. All right.

505
00:28:47,892 --> 00:28:52,438
No.

506
00:28:54,065 --> 00:28:55,065
Go back one. Go back one.

507
00:28:58,820 --> 00:29:01,155
Yeah. Yeah.

508
00:29:07,746 --> 00:29:11,415
ICERs? Great. How did we get stuck
with a nonlethal option?

509
00:29:11,499 --> 00:29:14,042
Coin flip. Trip called tails.

510
00:29:14,127 --> 00:29:15,419
Just getting word from the lab.

511
00:29:15,503 --> 00:29:17,921
Fitz might have something we can use
to neutralize Creel's powers.

512
00:29:18,006 --> 00:29:19,923
Best news we've had all day.

513
00:29:21,843 --> 00:29:24,344
Raina's trackerjust popped.
Creel's here.

514
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:26,805
Trip, are you in position?

515
00:29:28,641 --> 00:29:30,851
Locked, loaded and lookin'...

516
00:29:31,186 --> 00:29:34,021
Found him. He's got the package.

517
00:29:37,358 --> 00:29:39,860
Looks like Creel is talking to the guy
with his back to him.

518
00:29:39,944 --> 00:29:43,280
That's his HYDRA contact.
The deal's going down. Skye?

519
00:29:43,364 --> 00:29:47,159
Running facial recognition now.
Let's put a name to that face.

520
00:29:47,243 --> 00:29:48,869
Let the exchange happen.

521
00:29:48,953 --> 00:29:50,037
Skye and Hunter, follow the new player.

522
00:29:50,121 --> 00:29:51,121
May, stay with Creel.

523
00:29:51,206 --> 00:29:52,247
Everyone copy?

524
00:29:52,332 --> 00:29:53,665
- Copy that.
- Copy.

525
00:29:57,295 --> 00:29:58,462
Copy that, sir.

526
00:30:00,882 --> 00:30:02,466
The package is still in place.

527
00:30:02,550 --> 00:30:05,135
Wonder why
Creel hasn't made the exchange yet.

528
00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:06,637
Can we get a laser mic on him?

529
00:30:08,431 --> 00:30:09,765
Skye, you copy?

530
00:30:10,391 --> 00:30:11,433
Skye?

531
00:30:12,268 --> 00:30:13,519
Oh, hell, no!

532
00:30:17,065 --> 00:30:18,982
You're not listening.

533
00:30:19,067 --> 00:30:21,443
It's spreading all over.
I can barely contain it.

534
00:30:23,196 --> 00:30:24,822
Pass me the case and I'll help you.

535
00:30:24,906 --> 00:30:28,659
Help me and I won't do to you
what I did to the waitress.

536
00:30:28,743 --> 00:30:30,702
Calm down, Mr. Creel.

537
00:30:30,787 --> 00:30:33,163
Take a deep breath
and clear your mind.

538
00:30:33,790 --> 00:30:35,666
Remember your training.

539
00:30:35,750 --> 00:30:39,253
Remember,
compliance will be rewarded.

540
00:30:47,887 --> 00:30:49,638
I'm happy to comply.

541
00:30:49,722 --> 00:30:52,850
Good. Very good.

542
00:31:33,391 --> 00:31:34,975
Everybody, out! Move!

543
00:31:54,203 --> 00:31:57,289
I'm not gonna sugarcoat it, pal.
This is really gonna hurt.

544
00:32:25,652 --> 00:32:26,985
"Scout's honor"?

545
00:32:27,070 --> 00:32:29,029
You were never a Boy Scout, were you?

546
00:32:31,741 --> 00:32:33,825
Present, huh!

547
00:32:34,243 --> 00:32:35,953
Order, huh!

548
00:33:06,859 --> 00:33:08,902
Breaking into cars now?

549
00:33:11,155 --> 00:33:12,572
Following up on a promise.

550
00:33:14,325 --> 00:33:15,409
Thanks to you.

551
00:33:16,494 --> 00:33:18,996
General Talbot's not the only one
with friends.

552
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:21,289
Though, I am sorry about that
two million you wanted.

553
00:33:21,374 --> 00:33:22,582
That I can't swing.

554
00:33:22,667 --> 00:33:24,334
Oh, you knew about that, too, eh?

555
00:33:24,419 --> 00:33:26,003
I'm the director of S.H.I.E.L.D.

556
00:33:26,087 --> 00:33:27,504
Well, that's just marvelous.

557
00:33:27,588 --> 00:33:31,508
Talbot wants me dead and now
I have no funds to run with. Any tips?

558
00:33:31,592 --> 00:33:35,095
Yeah. Don't run. Work for me instead.

559
00:33:36,764 --> 00:33:39,975
Creel must've hit you in the head.
I shot three of your agents.

560
00:33:40,059 --> 00:33:42,269
Including Agent May.
Not a smart move.

561
00:33:43,229 --> 00:33:44,354
She the type that holds a grudge?

562
00:33:44,439 --> 00:33:46,398
Savors it, actually.

563
00:33:46,941 --> 00:33:48,942
No doubt, you've made some mistakes.

564
00:33:49,027 --> 00:33:52,070
So have I.
Like letting you go after Creel.

565
00:33:52,613 --> 00:33:53,905
But I felt for you.

566
00:33:54,574 --> 00:33:57,492
Yeah, and I took advantage of that.
How do you know I won't do it again?

567
00:33:57,577 --> 00:33:58,785
I don't.

568
00:33:58,870 --> 00:34:02,497
But the reality is, I don't have
a fleet of Helicarriers or Quinjets

569
00:34:02,582 --> 00:34:05,333
or thousands of agents
at my disposal anymore.

570
00:34:05,418 --> 00:34:08,003
We're lucky we still have
our George Foreman grill.

571
00:34:08,087 --> 00:34:09,713
You need warm bodies. Is that it?

572
00:34:09,797 --> 00:34:12,883
I need skilled assets in the field
who are willing to step over the line.

573
00:34:12,967 --> 00:34:15,802
To do the wrong thing,
but for the right reason.

574
00:34:15,887 --> 00:34:19,014
I need you because I can't be you.
Not anymore.

575
00:34:19,098 --> 00:34:22,309
Yeah, well, you're better off. Trust me.

576
00:34:22,393 --> 00:34:24,227
Look, it's your choice.

577
00:34:24,312 --> 00:34:28,982
But good people, people I respect,
vouched for you.

578
00:34:29,817 --> 00:34:30,984
I'd like to find out why.

579
00:34:32,487 --> 00:34:33,820
Hell if I know.

580
00:34:39,577 --> 00:34:40,869
But I'm curious.

581
00:34:40,953 --> 00:34:42,579
Good enough.

582
00:34:43,081 --> 00:34:44,081
Oh.

583
00:34:45,333 --> 00:34:46,917
I just need you to do one thing.

584
00:34:47,001 --> 00:34:48,335
Oh, yeah?

585
00:34:48,961 --> 00:34:50,253
Sell me out.

586
00:34:55,510 --> 00:34:58,845
The sound waves
disrupted the molecular, um...

587
00:35:00,473 --> 00:35:02,015
The molecular... The, um...

588
00:35:04,185 --> 00:35:07,020
Well, you should understand,
you modified it.

589
00:35:07,105 --> 00:35:10,023
Well, you know how some guys
can play a tune by ear?

590
00:35:10,108 --> 00:35:11,650
Well, I need sheet music.

591
00:35:14,862 --> 00:35:16,029
The original one.

592
00:35:16,823 --> 00:35:19,282
You built this with this Agent Simmons
I keep hearing about?

593
00:35:20,201 --> 00:35:22,119
Yeah. What about Simmons?

594
00:35:22,203 --> 00:35:26,039
Oh, no. I heard that she was cool.
Heard that you two were pretty tight.

595
00:35:27,208 --> 00:35:28,333
Yeah.

596
00:35:32,964 --> 00:35:34,214
It's tough to lose a good partner.

597
00:35:36,884 --> 00:35:38,385
How have you been holding up
since she left?

598
00:35:43,975 --> 00:35:45,725
I'm okay.

599
00:35:48,020 --> 00:35:49,396
I'm glad he's talking to someone.

600
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:52,149
I've got to admit,
I'm having a tough time with it.

601
00:35:52,233 --> 00:35:54,734
It's understandable. He's changed.

602
00:35:55,736 --> 00:35:58,488
We all have. Even the director.

603
00:36:02,410 --> 00:36:05,495
Coulson has a lot on his plate.
Rebuilding S.H.I.E.L.D.

604
00:36:06,414 --> 00:36:09,875
I wouldn't know. He's not exactly
the sharing type these days.

605
00:36:12,712 --> 00:36:17,591
He has the world to worry about.
Not just us. Not just the team.

606
00:36:17,675 --> 00:36:19,342
That's not it, May.

607
00:36:19,427 --> 00:36:20,677
I have been watching him for months

608
00:36:20,761 --> 00:36:22,262
and I know he's keeping something
from me.

609
00:36:22,346 --> 00:36:24,681
And it's not just because
he's the director of S.H.I.E.L.D.

610
00:36:25,349 --> 00:36:27,100
I think something is wrong with him.

611
00:36:27,185 --> 00:36:29,895
- Skye...
- No, May, be honest.

612
00:36:30,730 --> 00:36:32,189
Is Coulson okay?

613
00:36:34,108 --> 00:36:35,192
Of course.

614
00:36:35,860 --> 00:36:37,360
What is wrong with you?

615
00:36:37,445 --> 00:36:39,863
You're Director now,
not some Level 1 field agent.

616
00:36:39,947 --> 00:36:42,199
There are no levels anymore.
I got rid of those.

617
00:36:42,283 --> 00:36:44,242
You never should've gone into the field
like that.

618
00:36:44,869 --> 00:36:46,620
- You're welcome.
- It's not funny, Phil.

619
00:36:47,079 --> 00:36:48,496
I know you.

620
00:36:48,581 --> 00:36:51,291
And I know when you're overly stressed.

621
00:36:53,085 --> 00:36:55,128
It's been 18 days
since your last episode.

622
00:36:55,213 --> 00:36:56,630
- Seventeen.
- Eighteen.

623
00:36:57,256 --> 00:36:58,632
Which means you're due
for another one.

624
00:36:59,759 --> 00:37:01,301
Overdue.

625
00:37:02,094 --> 00:37:03,470
And I'm tired of fighting it.

626
00:37:03,554 --> 00:37:04,638
So don't.

627
00:37:05,932 --> 00:37:07,140
That's why I'm here.

628
00:38:38,232 --> 00:38:40,400
You did well.

629
00:38:42,737 --> 00:38:44,738
Thank you. I...

630
00:38:46,866 --> 00:38:47,991
Now pick it up.

631
00:38:52,246 --> 00:38:53,580
- You want me...
- I need to know.

632
00:38:55,082 --> 00:38:56,416
So do you.

633
00:38:58,085 --> 00:38:59,085
Pick it up.

634
00:39:34,121 --> 00:39:35,288
It worked!

635
00:39:36,248 --> 00:39:37,916
No.

636
00:39:38,417 --> 00:39:39,918
It let you live.

637
00:39:41,045 --> 00:39:42,796
There's a difference.

638
00:39:44,924 --> 00:39:47,384
Show me. Please.

639
00:39:50,971 --> 00:39:53,223
Bring me my daughter

640
00:39:53,307 --> 00:39:54,974
and I'll show the both of you.

641
00:40:16,205 --> 00:40:17,539
Set up a perimeter.

642
00:40:18,499 --> 00:40:19,499
Yes, sir.

643
00:40:20,835 --> 00:40:21,835
Glenn.

644
00:40:22,461 --> 00:40:23,878
Can I call you "Glenn"?

645
00:40:23,963 --> 00:40:26,464
No. Where's Hunter?

646
00:40:27,007 --> 00:40:31,511
Watching Cake Boss, I believe.
Sorry, I changed the terms of your deal.

647
00:40:32,346 --> 00:40:34,931
Well, he kept up his end. You're here.
Question is, why?

648
00:40:35,015 --> 00:40:38,852
I felt bad for kidnapping you,
so I brought you a peace offering.

649
00:40:39,353 --> 00:40:40,728
Carl Creel.

650
00:40:41,313 --> 00:40:42,647
I thought Creel was dead.

651
00:40:42,731 --> 00:40:44,482
He's turned to stone,
but he could always do that

652
00:40:44,567 --> 00:40:46,609
so I'm not sure how long it'll hold.

653
00:40:46,694 --> 00:40:48,736
I've got him in a cryostasis chamber
in the back of the van

654
00:40:48,821 --> 00:40:52,115
for 58 more minutes,
before the juice runs out.

655
00:40:52,199 --> 00:40:55,952
I'd get him someplace secure
pretty quick.

656
00:40:56,036 --> 00:40:59,080
Maybe a little more secure
than last time. Just saying.

657
00:41:00,166 --> 00:41:01,458
Very generous of you.

658
00:41:01,542 --> 00:41:04,419
Like I told you before, General,
we're the good guys.

659
00:41:04,503 --> 00:41:06,629
So, how about we make a deal?

660
00:41:06,714 --> 00:41:09,132
S.H.I.E.L.D. will keep dropping off
presents like this,

661
00:41:09,216 --> 00:41:11,301
you keep getting promoted.

662
00:41:11,385 --> 00:41:13,970
All we ask for in return
is a little breathing room.

663
00:41:14,054 --> 00:41:15,054
Sound good?

664
00:41:16,390 --> 00:41:18,141
You...

665
00:41:18,851 --> 00:41:21,561
You must have
some big brass ones, Coulson.

666
00:41:22,188 --> 00:41:25,064
Coming out here
by yourself to meet me.

667
00:41:25,733 --> 00:41:27,775
Face-to-face. No backup.

668
00:41:29,570 --> 00:41:30,737
Let's face facts.

669
00:41:30,821 --> 00:41:34,199
You and your little band of misfits
are hardly S.H.I.E.L.D.

670
00:41:34,283 --> 00:41:37,410
Our intel says you don't have enough
manpower or artillery

671
00:41:37,578 --> 00:41:39,037
to take down a convenience store.

672
00:41:39,121 --> 00:41:41,623
So, I'm sorry, I'm gonna have to say no
to that deal.

673
00:41:42,082 --> 00:41:43,249
I don't know,

674
00:41:44,084 --> 00:41:46,127
I think we're good in artillery.

675
00:41:54,553 --> 00:41:58,765
And in case you get any ideas, General,
that's just the tip of the iceberg.

676
00:42:04,146 --> 00:42:07,273
Let's get out of here before the iceberg
runs out of fuel.
