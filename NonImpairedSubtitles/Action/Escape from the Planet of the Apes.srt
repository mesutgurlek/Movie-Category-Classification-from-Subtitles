 159 
00:19:07,182 --> 00:19:09,117
This is my wife Zira.

 160 
00:19:09,185 --> 00:19:12,520
And I'm Lewis.
Lewis Dixon.

 161 
00:19:12,590 --> 00:19:15,561
Nobody's going to believe this.

 162 
00:19:15,629 --> 00:19:16,960
Believe what?

 163 
00:19:17,030 --> 00:19:19,830
- That primitive apes can talk.
- Primitive?

 164 
00:19:19,901 --> 00:19:24,397
Uh...well, I mean
that in our, um...

 165 
00:19:24,475 --> 00:19:28,607
primitive, um, civilization,
apes just don't talk.

 166 
00:19:28,682 --> 00:19:30,617
I mean, I think
it's important that when

 167 
00:19:30,685 --> 00:19:34,087
our primitive security
precautions are lifted,

 168 
00:19:34,156 --> 00:19:37,150
that the first time
you say anything in public,

 169 
00:19:37,228 --> 00:19:39,993
you should talk
to what we primitively call

 170 
00:19:40,065 --> 00:19:42,331
the right people.

 171 
00:19:45,273 --> 00:19:47,606
May I say something...

 172 
00:19:47,677 --> 00:19:49,612
personal?

 173 
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:51,615
Please.

 174 
00:19:51,683 --> 00:19:53,584
I like you.

 175 
00:19:57,959 --> 00:20:00,292
I have from the beginning.

[Murmuring]

 177 
00:20:15,252 --> 00:20:17,778
- Good afternoon, gentlemen.
- All: Mr. President.

 178 
00:20:17,856 --> 00:20:21,692
I'm aware that what I have to
tell you may conceivably create
a credibility gap

 179 
00:20:21,762 --> 00:20:24,323
- somewhat wider than the Grand Canyon.
- [Laughing]

 180 
00:20:24,399 --> 00:20:28,132
Nonetheless, it is true.
Yesterday, a U.S. spacecraft

 181 
00:20:28,205 --> 00:20:31,438
splashed down off
the Southern California coast.

 182 
00:20:31,510 --> 00:20:33,479
It was one of two that
have been missing in space

 183 
00:20:33,546 --> 00:20:35,515
for over 2 years now.

 184 
00:20:35,583 --> 00:20:38,577
To be exact, the one commanded
by Colonel Taylor.

 185 
00:20:38,654 --> 00:20:40,213
[Murmuring]

 186 
00:20:40,290 --> 00:20:42,521
Have they identified the bodies,
Mr. President?

 187 
00:20:42,594 --> 00:20:47,590
They have identified
3 bodies, yes, all living.

 188 
00:20:47,667 --> 00:20:49,499
[Murmuring]

 189 
00:20:49,570 --> 00:20:53,167
At the time of their rescue,
through an unfortunate accident

 190 
00:20:53,243 --> 00:20:56,305
one of them was killed early
this morning in the Los Angeles Zoo.

 191 
00:20:56,381 --> 00:20:58,748
- Zoo?
- What would astronauts

 192 
00:20:58,818 --> 00:21:01,049
be doing in a zoo,
Mr. President?

 193 
00:21:01,121 --> 00:21:05,025
They are not astronauts,
General Faulkner.

 194 
00:21:05,094 --> 00:21:07,564
- They are apes.
- [Murmuring]

 195 
00:21:07,632 --> 00:21:09,567
Chimpanzees,
to be more precise.

 196 
00:21:09,635 --> 00:21:12,332
They're harmless, friendly,
and by all reports

 197 
00:21:12,405 --> 00:21:14,967
extremely intelligent
and sophisticated creatures.

 198 
00:21:15,043 --> 00:21:16,978
But naturally, being animals,

 199 
00:21:17,046 --> 00:21:20,244
they cannot tell us
where the ship came from

 200 
00:21:20,317 --> 00:21:22,651
or how they
came to be in it.

 201 
00:21:22,721 --> 00:21:24,815
I have, therefore,
decided to convene

 202 
00:21:24,891 --> 00:21:28,328
a Presidential Commission of lnquiry
in Los Angeles tomorrow.

 203 
00:21:28,397 --> 00:21:30,958
The 2 surviving apes

 204 
00:21:31,034 --> 00:21:34,004
will be presented to the commission
for their inspection.

 205 
00:21:34,071 --> 00:21:37,474
The press will be invited to attend,
not to participate.

 206 
00:21:37,543 --> 00:21:40,673
I don't believe
that we can withhold

 207 
00:21:40,748 --> 00:21:45,687
this extraordinary discovery
from the world any longer.

One of the 2
American spaceships

believed until now to have
disintegrated in orbit,

splashed down unexpectedly yesterday
in the Pacific Ocean

off the coast
ofSouthern California.

And is stated
to have been manned--

by monkeys.

General!

 218 
00:22:23,747 --> 00:22:26,216
No comment.
I have nothing to say, gentlemen.

- Reporters: Senator!
- I'm sorry , boys, not now.

I haven't the time now.
A little later, please.

Here comes the chairman.

Later. Later.

 223

As the president's
senior science advisor,

 224 
00:22:41,073 --> 00:22:44,875
what do you expect to experience
from this historic meeting?

 225 
00:22:44,946 --> 00:22:47,940
- Fear.
- [All Talking At Once]

 226 
00:22:53,258 --> 00:22:55,660
All right now,
after I break the news,

 227 
00:22:55,729 --> 00:22:58,528
I want you to start slowly
with simple answers to what will

 228 
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:00,796
certainly be
simple questions.

 229 
00:23:00,869 --> 00:23:03,635
And if the questions
become less simple?

 230 
00:23:03,708 --> 00:23:07,840
- Be yourself.
- Your better self, Zira.

 231 
00:23:07,914 --> 00:23:10,976
- Please.
- [Knock]
Man: They're ready, sir.

00:23:11,052 --> 00:23:12,987
All right, it's time.

00:23:14,791 --> 00:23:17,693
What do they think
we are, gorillas?

 234 
00:23:17,762 --> 00:23:19,890
I'm sorry .

That's it.
Just be seated.

Uh, Mr. Chairman,
members of the commission,

 237 
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:43,164
Iadies and gentlemen,
my name is Lewis Dixon.

 238 
00:23:43,238 --> 00:23:45,435
And I am
the animal psychiatrist

 239 
00:23:45,508 --> 00:23:47,977
who has been in charge
of these 2 apes

 240 
00:23:48,045 --> 00:23:50,344
since they came to
the Los Angeles Zoo.

 241 
00:23:50,415 --> 00:23:53,250
My associate,
Dr. Stephanie Branton

 242 
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:55,516
and I are ready
to answer your questions.

 243 
00:23:55,590 --> 00:23:59,050
What may astonish you
is that, um,

 244 
00:23:59,129 --> 00:24:01,121
our chimpanzee friends

 245 
00:24:01,199 --> 00:24:04,465
are ready to answer
your questions too.

 246 
00:24:04,536 --> 00:24:07,234
Not by signs, not by looks,
or movements,

 247 
00:24:07,308 --> 00:24:09,869
but by words.

 248

- Ha ha ha!
- Ha ha ha!

[Gavel Strikes Bench]

 250 
00:24:15,954 --> 00:24:19,221
Dr. Dixon, as a zoologist,
I know and respect your work,

 251 
00:24:19,293 --> 00:24:21,888
but if you think you're going to turn
a presidential inquiry

 252 
00:24:21,963 --> 00:24:24,490
into a ventriloquist's act,
I have to inform you--

 253 
00:24:24,567 --> 00:24:26,502
And I have to inform you, sir,
that these two apes

 254 
00:24:26,570 --> 00:24:28,505
have acquired
the power ofspeech.

 255 
00:24:28,573 --> 00:24:30,804
Come now, Doctor,
you know as well as I do

 256 
00:24:30,877 --> 00:24:32,812
their brain system
is not developed

 257 
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:35,680
in either the vocal or
abstract thinking area.

 258 
00:24:35,751 --> 00:24:38,118
Yes, sir, but I repeat
that they have the power ofspeech.

 259 
00:24:38,188 --> 00:24:41,751
And it is for you gentlemen
to assess how far that power

 260 
00:24:41,827 --> 00:24:43,762
can be exercised intelligently.

 261 
00:24:43,830 --> 00:24:47,666
Well, may we be told which
is the female of the species?

 262 
00:24:51,909 --> 00:24:55,074
Did she rise as a reflex
to you having indicated her,

 263 
00:24:55,147 --> 00:24:57,116
or in answer to my question?

 264 
00:24:57,184 --> 00:24:59,676
That's for you to decide.

 265 
00:25:01,590 --> 00:25:04,823
- Have you a name?
- Zira.

 266 
00:25:04,895 --> 00:25:06,830
[Crowd Gasps]

 267 
00:25:06,898 --> 00:25:08,833
Certainly she can articulate,

 268 
00:25:08,901 --> 00:25:11,530
which, in itself,
is extraordinary !

 269 
00:25:11,605 --> 00:25:15,134
Uh, but, Dr. Dixon, are we
to infer that Zira is her name

 270 
00:25:15,211 --> 00:25:17,476
or some phrase
in her language?

 271 
00:25:17,547 --> 00:25:19,482
Infer what you will,
Mr. Chairman.

 272 
00:25:19,550 --> 00:25:21,815
I suggest you
rephrase the question.

 273 
00:25:25,459 --> 00:25:27,360
What is your name?

 274 
00:25:27,429 --> 00:25:29,398
Zi-ra!

 275 
00:25:31,335 --> 00:25:33,737
One might as well
be talking to a parrot.

 276

A parrot!

Mechanical mimicry . Unique in
an ape vocally, without a doubt,

00:25:42,852 --> 00:25:45,914
but, uh, does
the other one talk?

 279 
00:25:48,327 --> 00:25:51,025
Only when she lets me.

- Dr. Hasslein?
- No... nothing.

- Mr. Chairman.
- Yes?

- What is the male's name, please?
- Cornelius.

- My lawfully wedded spouse.
- Wedded?

00:26:16,437 --> 00:26:19,100
We'll take that up later,
Your Eminence.

 286 
00:26:21,144 --> 00:26:25,105
Cornelius, do you and
your lawfully wedded spouse

 287 
00:26:25,183 --> 00:26:27,311
speak any language
other than English?

 288 
00:26:27,386 --> 00:26:29,184
What is English?

 289 
00:26:29,256 --> 00:26:31,886
I speak the language
taught to me

 290 
00:26:31,961 --> 00:26:35,524
by my father and mother,
who were taught by their
fathers and mothers before them.

 291 
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:37,592
It has been the language
ofour ancestors

 292 
00:26:37,669 --> 00:26:39,638
for nearly 2,000 years.

 293 
00:26:39,706 --> 00:26:42,437
As to its origins,
who can be sure?

 294 
00:26:42,510 --> 00:26:46,243
Gorillas and orangutans
ofour community believe

 295 
00:26:46,315 --> 00:26:49,377
that God created the ape
in his own image.

 296 
00:26:49,454 --> 00:26:53,222
Nonsense!

 297 
00:26:53,293 --> 00:26:56,092
Cornelius, as an intellectual,
you know damned well

 298 
00:26:56,163 --> 00:26:58,861
the gorillas are a bunch
ofmilitaristic nincompoops.

 299 
00:26:58,935 --> 00:27:01,029
And the orangutans are
a bunch ofblinkered,

 300 
00:27:01,105 --> 00:27:03,506
pseudoscientific geese!

 301 
00:27:07,047 --> 00:27:09,448
As to humans, I've dissect--

 302 
00:27:09,517 --> 00:27:12,454
I've examined thousands of them.

 303 
00:27:12,522 --> 00:27:16,722
And until now, I've only discovered
2 who could talk in my life.

 304 
00:27:16,795 --> 00:27:19,629
God knows who taught them.

 305 
00:27:19,700 --> 00:27:21,635
Where we come from,

 306 
00:27:21,703 --> 00:27:24,229
apes talk.

 307 
00:27:24,307 --> 00:27:26,242
Humans are dumb.

 308 
00:27:32,185 --> 00:27:34,518
Where do you come from,
Cornelius?

 309 
00:27:35,991 --> 00:27:38,392
I'm not sure.

 310 
00:27:38,461 --> 00:27:40,362
Dr. Milo was sure.

 311 
00:27:42,067 --> 00:27:45,470
Dr. Milo was a genius
well in advance ofhis time.

 312 
00:27:45,539 --> 00:27:48,977
When the spacecraft
first landed on our seaboard,

 313 
00:27:49,044 --> 00:27:50,979
it was Dr. Milo who salvaged it.

 314 
00:27:51,047 --> 00:27:54,541
He studied it
and halfunderstood it.

 315 
00:27:54,620 --> 00:27:57,249
Half?
Was halfenough?

 316 
00:27:57,323 --> 00:28:00,522
It was enough for us to escape
when war became inevitable.

 317 
00:28:00,595 --> 00:28:03,588
Enough for Dr. Milo
to be murdered in your zoo.

 318 
00:28:03,666 --> 00:28:06,068
Enough for my wife and I
to be here now.

 319 
00:28:06,137 --> 00:28:10,405
- From where, Cornelius?
- I told you, I'm not sure.

 320 
00:28:10,477 --> 00:28:13,276
Maybe the female knows.

 321 
00:28:13,347 --> 00:28:16,147
Of course the female knows!

 322 
00:28:16,219 --> 00:28:18,347
We came from your future!

 323 
00:28:25,333 --> 00:28:28,861
That doesn't make any sense.

 324 
00:28:28,937 --> 00:28:30,872
It's the only thing that does.

 325 
00:28:30,940 --> 00:28:33,604
- Mr. Chairman.
- Yes?

 326 
00:28:33,679 --> 00:28:38,209
Cornelius, you spoke ofwar.

 327 
00:28:38,285 --> 00:28:42,451
- War between whom?
- The gorillas and whoever lives--Iived.

 328 
00:28:42,525 --> 00:28:45,428
- Will live.
- Who won the war?

 329 
00:28:45,496 --> 00:28:50,128
I don't know. Chimpanzees are pacifists.
We stayed at home.

 330 
00:28:50,203 --> 00:28:53,800
- But you left before the war had ended.
- In a spaceship.

 331 
00:28:53,875 --> 00:28:56,812
- Which Dr. Milo learned to navigate.
- Correct.

 332 
00:28:56,880 --> 00:29:00,909
Cornelius.
Did you know Colonel Taylor?

 333 
00:29:03,890 --> 00:29:06,827
No. Is he a soldier?

 334 
00:29:08,331 --> 00:29:11,267
We are peaceful creatures.

 335 
00:29:11,335 --> 00:29:13,304
We are happy to be here.

 336 
00:29:13,371 --> 00:29:15,500
May we be unchained?

 337 
00:29:30,331 --> 00:29:33,063
Here they come.
Gentlemen, do you have--

 338 
00:29:33,136 --> 00:29:35,071
No comment.
No comment.

 339 
00:29:35,139 --> 00:29:39,100
- No comment.
- No comment.

 340 
00:29:39,178 --> 00:29:41,841
- Mr. Chairman, a word.
- I'll give you one-- preposterous.

 341 
00:29:41,915 --> 00:29:45,216
- Well, can you define that,
Mr. Chairman?
- Uh, no, let me just say this.

 342 
00:29:45,287 --> 00:29:48,121
As head of this commission,
it will be our duty to sit through

 343 
00:29:48,191 --> 00:29:51,094
the facts of this bizarre affair
and pass our conclusions

 344 
00:29:51,163 --> 00:29:54,896
onto the president of the United States
for implementation.

 345 
00:29:54,968 --> 00:29:59,270
- What a load ofhogger mogger.
- Dr. Hasslein.

 346 
00:29:59,341 --> 00:30:01,606
- No comment, please.
- How will you advise the president

 347 
00:30:01,678 --> 00:30:03,613
to handle this
unique situation?

 348 
00:30:03,681 --> 00:30:05,844
- No comment.
- All right then, Dr. Hasslein,

 349 
00:30:05,919 --> 00:30:08,184
could you tell us how you
personally would handle it?

 350 
00:30:08,255 --> 00:30:12,489
No, gentlemen,
no comment...yet.

 351 
00:30:12,562 --> 00:30:14,155
Doctor.

 352 
00:30:14,231 --> 00:30:16,166
You were fabulous!

 353 
00:30:16,234 --> 00:30:18,567
You were marvelous.
They loved you. All that applause.

 354 
00:30:18,637 --> 00:30:20,833
But there was a moment--

 355 
00:30:20,907 --> 00:30:23,537
There was when he
started to ask us--

 356 
00:30:23,612 --> 00:30:25,740
Zira!

 357 
00:30:25,815 --> 00:30:29,412
-Cornelius, I think we should tell them.
-No.

 358 
00:30:29,487 --> 00:30:33,926
- But only to Lewis and Stevie.
- Oh, Zira.

 359 
00:30:33,994 --> 00:30:36,988
I have to be honest
with someone.

 360 
00:30:37,066 --> 00:30:38,898
Cornelius, please.

 361 
00:30:38,969 --> 00:30:41,438
You tell them.

 362 
00:30:44,944 --> 00:30:47,743
Well, you see...

 363 
00:30:47,815 --> 00:30:49,750
we did know Colonel Taylor.

 364 
00:30:49,818 --> 00:30:52,288
We came to love him.

 365 
00:30:52,356 --> 00:30:55,349
I don't understand what harm there could
be in telling that to the commission?

 366 
00:30:55,426 --> 00:30:59,159
Where we come from,

 367 
00:30:59,232 --> 00:31:02,533
apes did not love humans.

 368 
00:31:02,604 --> 00:31:06,042
They, uh, hunted them
for sport,

 369 
00:31:06,110 --> 00:31:08,045
much as you would animals.

 370 
00:31:08,113 --> 00:31:11,106
Yes. We use their bodies,
alive and dead,

 371 
00:31:11,183 --> 00:31:14,177
experimentally for
anatomical dissection

 372 
00:31:14,255 --> 00:31:16,918
and scientific research.

 373 
00:31:19,997 --> 00:31:24,299
Well, we do the same thing
to animals.

 374 
00:31:24,370 --> 00:31:27,069
I mean, as a scientist,
I sympathize,

 375 
00:31:27,203 --> 00:31:31,107
but I agree that that's a revelation
the masses would not take kindly to.

 376 
00:31:31,176 --> 00:31:34,636
I think you did the right thing
in denying knowledge of colonel Taylor.

 377 
00:31:34,714 --> 00:31:38,812
- There was another reason.
- Stevie: What?

 378 
00:31:38,887 --> 00:31:41,584
They would have asked
ifhe was still alive.

 379 
00:31:41,658 --> 00:31:45,187
- And is he?
- Oh, no, no, no, he can't be.

 380 
00:31:45,263 --> 00:31:47,164
Well, how did you know?

 381 
00:31:47,233 --> 00:31:49,725
Because

 382 
00:31:49,803 --> 00:31:53,833
from the windows
of the spaceship...

 383 
00:31:53,910 --> 00:31:56,903
we saw the Earth...

 384 
00:31:56,981 --> 00:31:58,916
destroyed.

 385 
00:32:05,695 --> 00:32:07,630
Stand by.

 386 
00:32:10,702 --> 00:32:13,639
Good evening, this is Bill Bonds
reporting from Los Angeles

 387 
00:32:13,707 --> 00:32:17,770
where the biggest story since
the moon landing broke this morning
when 2 apes talked.

 388 
00:32:17,846 --> 00:32:22,444
I repeat, talked to the
Presidential Commission of lnquiry .

 389 
00:32:22,519 --> 00:32:25,888
With me this evening in the studio
is Dr. Otto Hasslein.

 390 
00:32:25,958 --> 00:32:28,450
He is a senior scientific advisor
at the White House.

 391 
00:32:28,529 --> 00:32:30,725
And he'll be giving us his views
on the crucial statement

 392 
00:32:30,799 --> 00:32:32,734
made at this
morning's session.

 393 
00:32:32,802 --> 00:32:36,501
Dr. Hasslein, as I recall,
when you asked the male ape

 394 
00:32:36,575 --> 00:32:38,237
where he was from,

 395 
00:32:38,311 --> 00:32:41,804
the female replied,
"From your future."

 396 
00:32:41,882 --> 00:32:44,478
- Yes.
- Would you believe that?

 397 
00:32:44,553 --> 00:32:48,116
Absolutely. I think
it is the only explanation.

 398 
00:32:48,192 --> 00:32:50,753
Well, maybe the explanation
needs some explaining now.

 399 
00:32:50,829 --> 00:32:52,991
You've written several
learned dissertations

 400 
00:32:53,066 --> 00:32:55,126
on the nature of time.

 401 
00:32:55,202 --> 00:32:58,071
Could you explain in terms that
our viewers at home will understand?

 402 
00:32:58,141 --> 00:33:01,305
How, for instance,
a person, or persons,

 403 
00:33:01,379 --> 00:33:05,181
could travel from
time past to time future

 404 
00:33:05,252 --> 00:33:07,915
or, indeed, vice versa?

 405 
00:33:07,989 --> 00:33:10,720
Mr. Bonds, I think that time
can only be fully understood

 406 
00:33:10,793 --> 00:33:14,663
by an observer with a godlike gift
ofinfinite regression.

 407 
00:33:14,732 --> 00:33:17,669
Could you explain
infinite regression for us?

 408 
00:33:17,737 --> 00:33:19,933
- Roll the film.
- I'd more than happy to.

 409 
00:33:20,007 --> 00:33:21,942
As a matter offact,
I came prepared to do just that.

 410 
00:33:22,010 --> 00:33:24,776
Now here's a painting
of a landscape.

 411 
00:33:24,848 --> 00:33:28,911
The artist who
painted that picture

 412 
00:33:28,988 --> 00:33:30,752
says something is missing--
what is it?

 413 
00:33:30,824 --> 00:33:34,956
"It is I myself, who was part
of the landscape I painted."

 414 
00:33:35,030 --> 00:33:39,298
So he mentally takes
a step backward, or regresses,

 415 
00:33:39,370 --> 00:33:42,603
and paints a picture of the artist
painting a picture of the landscape.

 416 
00:33:42,675 --> 00:33:46,044
But still something is missing-- and
that something is still his real self

 417 
00:33:46,114 --> 00:33:48,481
painting the second picture.

 418 
00:33:48,550 --> 00:33:51,521
So he regresses further
and paints a third.

 419 
00:33:51,589 --> 00:33:54,058
A picture of the artist
painting a picture

 420 
00:33:54,126 --> 00:33:57,187
of the artist painting
a picture of the landscape.

 421 
00:33:57,263 --> 00:33:59,699
But because something
is still missing,

 422 
00:33:59,768 --> 00:34:01,703
he paints
a fourth and a fifth

 423 
00:34:01,771 --> 00:34:04,070
until he paints
a picture of the artist

 424 
00:34:04,141 --> 00:34:08,204
painting a picture of the artist
painting a picture of the artist

 425 
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:11,445
painting a picture of the artist
painting a landscape.

 426 
00:34:11,519 --> 00:34:13,715
So infinite regression then is--

 427 
00:34:13,789 --> 00:34:17,727
It is the moment when our artist
has regressed to the point ofinfinity,

 428 
00:34:17,795 --> 00:34:19,957
and himself, becomes part
of the landscape he painted

 429 
00:34:20,031 --> 00:34:22,193
and is both the observer
and the observed.

 430 
00:34:22,268 --> 00:34:24,966
Well, now in that
peculiar condition,

 431 
00:34:25,039 --> 00:34:28,533
what would he be observing
ifhe were observing, let's say, time?

 432 
00:34:28,611 --> 00:34:32,174
He would perceive, Mr. Bonds,
that time is like a freeway

 433 
00:34:32,250 --> 00:34:34,219
with an infinite
number oflanes,

 434 
00:34:34,287 --> 00:34:36,518
all leading from
the past into the future,

 435 
00:34:36,590 --> 00:34:38,525
however, not unto the same future.

 436 
00:34:38,593 --> 00:34:42,292
A driver in lane "A" may crash
while a driver in lane "B" survives.

 437 
00:34:42,365 --> 00:34:46,235
It follows that a driver,
by changing lanes can change his future.

 438 
00:34:46,305 --> 00:34:48,934
Now, Mr. Bonds, I do not
find it diffcult to believe

 439 
00:34:49,008 --> 00:34:51,638
that in the dark and turbulent
corridors ofouter space,

 440 
00:34:51,713 --> 00:34:55,549
the impact ofsome distant planetary ,
even galactic disaster,

 441 
00:34:55,619 --> 00:34:57,815
jumped the apes from
their present into ours.

 442 
00:34:57,889 --> 00:35:00,984
Indeed, the prooflies
in their arrival among us.

 443 
00:35:01,061 --> 00:35:03,530
And in their spoken,
and I repeat spoken testimony.

 444 
00:35:03,598 --> 00:35:05,794
Thank you very much,
Dr. Hasslein.

 445 
00:35:05,868 --> 00:35:09,567
It's certainly the most incredible story
this reporter has ever covered.

 446 
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:12,075
I think that by their intelligence
and their good humor,

 447 
00:35:12,144 --> 00:35:14,979
the 2 so-called "ape-o-nauts"
have already captured the hearts

 448 
00:35:15,048 --> 00:35:17,449
of the entire American nation.

 449 
00:35:17,519 --> 00:35:19,317
They will not be required

 450 
00:35:19,388 --> 00:35:21,323
to appear before
the commission tomorrow.

 451 
00:35:21,391 --> 00:35:23,223
That hearing, of course,
is going to be held in private.

 452 
00:35:23,294 --> 00:35:27,198
They will, however, be taken
from the zoo infirmary to a hotel,

 453 
00:35:27,267 --> 00:35:30,329
and they will be given
an extended tour of the city.

 454 
00:35:30,405 --> 00:35:33,569
This is Bill Bonds reporting
for Eyewitness News.

 455 
00:35:33,643 --> 00:35:36,307
- Good night.
- Good night.

 456 
00:35:43,457 --> 00:35:45,393
[Siren]

 457 
00:36:16,174 --> 00:36:18,109
[Dog Barking]

 458 
00:36:23,952 --> 00:36:27,253
- Your luggage, ma'am?
- Of course, it's mine!

 459 
00:36:38,041 --> 00:36:40,442
Address, please.

 460 
00:36:43,850 --> 00:36:47,413
- The zoo.
- [Laughs]

 461 
00:37:38,599 --> 00:37:40,261
40.

 462 
00:37:41,437 --> 00:37:43,770
May I measure
your inside leg, sir?

 463 
00:37:46,077 --> 00:37:48,603
- No.
- Oh.

 464 
00:38:54,849 --> 00:38:58,183
Dr. Cornelius, tell me,
how do you find our women?

 465 
00:39:01,191 --> 00:39:03,126
Very human.

 466 
00:39:03,194 --> 00:39:04,927
Very good.
Very good.

 467 
00:39:06,830 --> 00:39:08,765
Excuse me.

 468 
00:39:08,833 --> 00:39:13,363
Madam Zira, I represent Furand Feather,
a pet magazine.

 469 
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:15,602
Do you think I'm a pet?

 470 
00:39:15,677 --> 00:39:17,669
Well, yes, I do, rather.

 471 
00:39:21,185 --> 00:39:24,088
- Say, why don't you try some?
- What is it?

 472 
00:39:24,157 --> 00:39:27,184
Well, it's sort of
like grape juice plus.

 473 
00:39:31,401 --> 00:39:33,597
Wait! Just a sip!

 474 
00:39:33,671 --> 00:39:38,076
Madam Zira,
what is your favorite fruit?

 475 
00:39:38,144 --> 00:39:40,170
Grape.

 476 
00:39:50,463 --> 00:39:52,865
And that's the way
it was tonight

 477 
00:39:52,934 --> 00:39:54,766
at the Beverly Wilshire Hotel.

 478 
00:39:54,837 --> 00:39:56,772
- Ha ha ha.
- Tomorrow, Zira is to speak

 479 
00:39:56,840 --> 00:39:58,775
at the Bay Area's Women's Club.

 480 
00:39:58,843 --> 00:40:02,679
And later, she'll accompany Dr. Hasslein
to the Museum of Natural History .

 481 
00:40:02,749 --> 00:40:06,380
Meanwhile, Cornelius will attend
a prizefight. That's his first one.

 482 
00:40:06,454 --> 00:40:08,389
Later, he'll visit Disneyland

 483 
00:40:08,457 --> 00:40:11,359
to dedicate a new boat
for theJungle Cruise.

 484 
00:40:11,428 --> 00:40:13,363
Now, for a look
at the weather.

 485 
00:40:13,431 --> 00:40:15,765
Sunny California will not
be exactly that tomorrow.

 486 
00:40:15,835 --> 00:40:19,067
Clouds will cover the coastal area
with light showers predicted.

 487 
00:40:19,140 --> 00:40:21,075
The downtown--

 488 
00:40:28,654 --> 00:40:30,623
[Knocking]

 489 
00:40:33,629 --> 00:40:36,599
- Tired?
- A little.

 490 
00:40:39,204 --> 00:40:43,404
- How is that?
- Soothing...

 491 
00:40:43,477 --> 00:40:45,742
but very wet.

 492 
00:40:55,028 --> 00:40:58,488
[Applause]

 493 
00:41:03,140 --> 00:41:06,543
A marriage bed
is made for two,

 494 
00:41:06,612 --> 00:41:10,311
but every damn morning
it's the woman who has to make it!

 495 
00:41:10,384 --> 00:41:13,753
We have heads
as well as hands.

 496 
00:41:13,823 --> 00:41:17,420
I call upon men
to let us use them!

 497 
00:41:21,835 --> 00:41:23,770
[Crowd Cheering]

 498 
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:45,798
How do you like it,
Cornelius?

 499 
00:41:45,871 --> 00:41:47,806
Beastly.

 500 
00:41:57,422 --> 00:42:00,018
A giant flesh-eating dinosaur.

 501 
00:42:00,093 --> 00:42:02,119
Now, its scientific name
is a compound

 502 
00:42:02,196 --> 00:42:04,665
of the greek antron
which means "hollow"

 503 
00:42:04,733 --> 00:42:07,202
and dimas which
means "body frame."

 504 
00:42:07,270 --> 00:42:09,866
Referring to
the backbone or vertebrae.

 505 
00:42:09,942 --> 00:42:13,573
Now, this little fellow
is Camptosaurus Marsh,

 506 
00:42:13,647 --> 00:42:16,208
a primitive duckbilled dinosaur.

 507 
00:42:16,284 --> 00:42:20,916
Its scientific name is
a compound of the greek kampto,

 508 
00:42:20,991 --> 00:42:23,427
which means
"flexible or bent,"

 509 
00:42:23,495 --> 00:42:26,021
and sauros,
which means "Iizard."

 510 
00:42:26,099 --> 00:42:29,662
Its generic name,
therefore, is "flexible lizard."

 511 
00:42:29,738 --> 00:42:33,733
In 1 879, O.C. Marsh
of yale University

 512 
00:42:33,811 --> 00:42:35,905
described the first known species

 513 
00:42:35,981 --> 00:42:38,109
from the Jurassic beds
of arikoma.

 514 
00:42:38,184 --> 00:42:41,212
Since then,
other specimens have been found--

 515 
00:42:44,461 --> 00:42:48,456
- It must have been the shock.
- Shock, my foot!

 516 
00:42:48,533 --> 00:42:50,525
I'm pregnant.

 517 
00:42:56,746 --> 00:42:59,409
I shan't leave you
until Cornelius is back.

 518 
00:42:59,483 --> 00:43:03,546
- No, no, no, no!
- No, I insist. Please sit down.

 519 
00:43:03,623 --> 00:43:05,819
Now, is there anything
I can get you, Zira?

 520 
00:43:05,893 --> 00:43:10,161
Well, I have a strange craving.

 521 
00:43:10,233 --> 00:43:12,429
That is only natural.

 522 
00:43:12,503 --> 00:43:15,098
For grape juice plus.

 523 
00:43:15,174 --> 00:43:17,109
Grape juice plus?

 524 
00:43:17,177 --> 00:43:20,477
It's in the--
the refrigerator.

 525 
00:43:22,484 --> 00:43:24,453
All right.

 526 
00:43:35,704 --> 00:43:37,639
Is this it?

 527 
00:43:44,485 --> 00:43:46,511
Here we go.

 528 
00:43:48,691 --> 00:43:50,819
Lewis said only a sip.

 529 
00:43:50,894 --> 00:43:53,888
Zira, it is an excellent restorative,
I assure you.

 530 
00:43:53,966 --> 00:43:56,561
Especially in cases ofpregnancy,
you know.

 531 
00:43:56,636 --> 00:44:00,665
- How long have you known?
- Oh, since well before the war.

 532 
00:44:04,748 --> 00:44:07,217
Mmm.

 533 
00:44:09,556 --> 00:44:12,355
- Do you mind if I smoke?
- Uh-uh.

 534 
00:44:12,427 --> 00:44:16,559
Oh, no, I shouldn't,
not in your condition.

 535 
00:44:18,236 --> 00:44:20,171
Who won your war?

 536 
00:44:20,239 --> 00:44:23,108
It wasn't our war.

 537 
00:44:23,177 --> 00:44:25,646
It was the gorillas' war.

 538 
00:44:25,714 --> 00:44:27,649
Chimpanzees are passion--

 539 
00:44:29,353 --> 00:44:31,686
pacifists!

 540 
00:44:31,756 --> 00:44:34,318
We stayed behind.
We never saw the enemy.

 541 
00:44:34,394 --> 00:44:36,191
But which side won?

 542 
00:44:36,264 --> 00:44:38,631
Neither.

 543 
00:44:38,700 --> 00:44:41,169
But how do you know that
if you weren't there, Zira?

 544 
00:44:41,237 --> 00:44:43,536
When we were in space,

 545 
00:44:43,607 --> 00:44:49,242
we saw bright, white,
blinding light.

 546 
00:44:49,316 --> 00:44:52,810
Then we saw the rim
of the Earth melt.

 547 
00:44:52,888 --> 00:44:57,919
Then there was
a tornado in the sky.

 548 
00:44:57,996 --> 00:44:59,794
Wooo.

 549 
00:44:59,866 --> 00:45:02,563
I feel magnificently sleepy.

 550 
00:45:02,636 --> 00:45:04,571
The date meter
on the spaceship.

 551 
00:45:04,639 --> 00:45:08,304
What did it read
af ter Earth's destruction?

 552 
00:45:08,378 --> 00:45:12,043
1 9...

 553 
00:45:12,117 --> 00:45:15,680
73.

 554 
00:45:15,756 --> 00:45:18,784
And before-- before
the white light and the tornado?

 555 
00:45:18,861 --> 00:45:21,695
39...

 556 
00:45:21,765 --> 00:45:24,634
50...

 557 
00:45:24,704 --> 00:45:26,832
something.

 558 
00:45:32,249 --> 00:45:34,775
Before the white light
and the tornado?

 559 
00:45:34,852 --> 00:45:36,980
Zira: 39...

 560 
00:45:37,055 --> 00:45:38,683
50...

 561 
00:45:38,758 --> 00:45:41,125
something.

 562 
00:45:41,195 --> 00:45:43,664
- So?
- So you have evidence, Mr. President,

 563 
00:45:43,732 --> 00:45:45,759
that one day, talking apes
will dominate this Earth

 564 
00:45:45,836 --> 00:45:48,397
and eventually destroy it
by 3950 something.

 565 
00:45:48,473 --> 00:45:51,933
I doubt that we shall
still be in office by then.

 566 
00:45:52,012 --> 00:45:54,379
And according
to the NASA experts,

 567 
00:45:54,448 --> 00:45:58,181
who are still subjecting the spaceship
to microscopic scrutiny,

 568 
00:45:58,254 --> 00:46:00,120
the precise year
ofwhat you merely inferred

 569 
00:46:00,190 --> 00:46:03,684
to be Earth's destruction
is recorded on the flight synthesizer

 570 
00:46:03,763 --> 00:46:08,999
as 3955 A.D., presumably.

 571 
00:46:09,071 --> 00:46:12,907
Now, what do you expect me
and the United Nations--

 572 
00:46:12,977 --> 00:46:15,139
though not necessarily
in that order--

 573 
00:46:15,213 --> 00:46:17,512
to do about it?

 574 
00:46:17,583 --> 00:46:19,882
Alter what you believe to be
the course of the future

 575 
00:46:19,953 --> 00:46:21,922
by slaughtering 2 innocents?

 576 
00:46:21,990 --> 00:46:24,756
Or rather 3, now that
one of them is pregnant.

 577 
00:46:24,828 --> 00:46:28,060
Herod tried that,
and Christ survived.

 578 
00:46:28,132 --> 00:46:30,067
Mr. President,
Herod lacked our facilities.

 579 
00:46:30,136 --> 00:46:34,336
He also became very unpopular,
historically unpopular.

 580 
00:46:34,409 --> 00:46:36,708
And we don't want
that to happen, do we?

 581 
00:46:36,779 --> 00:46:41,947
I am saying that our 2 visitors seem
to be charming, peaceful people--

 582 
00:46:42,021 --> 00:46:45,925
or rather creatures--
and that the voters love them.

 583 
00:46:45,993 --> 00:46:48,394
Do you want them and their progeny
to dominate the world, Mr. President?

 584 
00:46:48,464 --> 00:46:51,663
Well, not at
the next election, no.

 585 
00:46:51,736 --> 00:46:53,898
But, one day,
if the progeny turn out

 586 
00:46:53,972 --> 00:46:56,464
as well as the parents,
who knows,

 587 
00:46:56,542 --> 00:46:58,508
they may do a betterjob ofit
than we have.

 588 
00:46:58,642 --> 00:47:00,975
By destroying the world?

 589 
00:47:01,046 --> 00:47:03,379
Are you quite sure that what
they saw destroyed was the world?

 590 
00:47:03,450 --> 00:47:07,946
- Well, aren't you?
- I consider it dispassionately

 591 
00:47:08,023 --> 00:47:11,222
as a possibility,
not hysterically as a fact.

 592 
00:47:11,295 --> 00:47:14,026
Mr. President, we have their own
testimony that they provoked the war.

 593 
00:47:14,099 --> 00:47:17,195
And they seemed to have provoked
you pretty thoroughly into the bargain.

 594 
00:47:17,271 --> 00:47:20,173
I'm not saying that you're wrong,
Hasslein, but I am saying

 595 
00:47:20,241 --> 00:47:23,701
that before I have them shot
against the wall, I want convincing

 596 
00:47:23,780 --> 00:47:27,650
that the handwriting on the wall
is calculably true.

 597 
00:47:27,719 --> 00:47:30,246
Now... convince me.

 598 
00:47:33,361 --> 00:47:36,264
By their own testimony we know
that apes one day will acquire

 599 
00:47:36,333 --> 00:47:38,529
the power of
intelligent speech.

 600 
00:47:38,603 --> 00:47:42,632
By Zira's testimony, we know
that she is pregnant with child.

 601 
00:47:42,709 --> 00:47:45,178
By my own testimony we know
that it's genetically possible

 602 
00:47:45,246 --> 00:47:48,581
for this child-- provided, of course,
always that we permit its birth--

 603 
00:47:48,651 --> 00:47:51,451
to bear or beget
a talking ape by a dumb one

 604 
00:47:51,523 --> 00:47:54,721
in a present-dayjungle
or a present-day zoo.

 605 
00:47:54,794 --> 00:47:58,493
Do you truly believe that
by deliberate present-day action

 606 
00:47:58,566 --> 00:48:00,501
we can neutralize
that possibility?

 607 
00:48:00,569 --> 00:48:03,836
- That we can alter the future?
- Yes, Mr. President, I do.

 608 
00:48:03,908 --> 00:48:06,708
Do you also believe
that we should?

 609 
00:48:06,779 --> 00:48:09,476
Given the power to alter the future,
have we the right to use it?

 610 
00:48:11,086 --> 00:48:13,487
I don't know.

 611 
00:48:13,556 --> 00:48:16,721
I've wrestled with this, Mr. President.
I just don't know.

 612 
00:48:16,794 --> 00:48:20,493
How many futures are there?
Which future has God, if there is a God,

 613 
00:48:20,567 --> 00:48:22,593
chosen for man's destiny?

 614 
00:48:23,771 --> 00:48:25,706
If I urged the destruction
of these 2 apes,

 615 
00:48:25,774 --> 00:48:28,267
am I defy ing God's will
or obeying it?

 616 
00:48:28,345 --> 00:48:30,405
Am I His enemy
or His instrument?

 617 
00:48:30,482 --> 00:48:34,079
An assassin would say the latter.

 618 
00:48:34,154 --> 00:48:36,623
- Do you approve of assassination?
- Well, Mr. President,

 619 
00:48:36,691 --> 00:48:40,220
we condoned the attempted assassination
of Hitler because he was evil.

 620 
00:48:40,296 --> 00:48:42,231
Yes, but would we have
approved killing him

 621 
00:48:42,299 --> 00:48:44,325
in babyhood when
he was still innocent?

 622 
00:48:44,403 --> 00:48:46,338
Or killing his mother when
he was still in her womb?

 623 
00:48:46,406 --> 00:48:49,468
Or slaughtering
his remote ancestors?

 624 
00:48:49,544 --> 00:48:52,105
We have no proof, Hasslein,
that these apes are evil.

 625 
00:48:52,181 --> 00:48:54,650
- Mr. President,
there are very strong indications.
- Such as.

 626 
00:48:54,718 --> 00:48:58,383
There were hesitancies
and small discrepancies in
their answers to the commission.

 627 
00:48:58,457 --> 00:49:00,426
Which suggests to me that
if they were properly interrogated--

 628 
00:49:00,493 --> 00:49:03,259
Are you suggesting that they
were improperly interrogated?

 629 
00:49:03,331 --> 00:49:05,857
- Let us say unprofessionally.
- You want it professional?

 630 
00:49:05,935 --> 00:49:08,063
- The full works, Mr. President.
- Tell that to the commission.

 631 
00:49:09,407 --> 00:49:13,311
I'll abide by their findings.

 632 
00:49:13,380 --> 00:49:17,443
Having convened in secret session
at the request of the president,

 633 
00:49:17,519 --> 00:49:20,752
the commission makes
the following interim recommendations--

 634 
00:49:20,825 --> 00:49:23,056
" 1 . The public
should be informed

 635 
00:49:23,128 --> 00:49:25,324
"that the apes, after
their arduous space voyage,

 636 
00:49:25,398 --> 00:49:28,767
"and the fatigue arising
from its intended publicity,

 637 
00:49:28,837 --> 00:49:32,138
"are to be afforded rest and privacy
in a location whose identity

 638 
00:49:32,209 --> 00:49:34,542
"will not be divulged
to the public.

 639 
00:49:34,612 --> 00:49:37,447
"2. Since, however,

 640 
00:49:37,517 --> 00:49:39,782
"there is justifiable cause
for suspecting

 641 
00:49:39,854 --> 00:49:43,314
"that they have withheld vital
information from this commission,

 642 
00:49:43,392 --> 00:49:47,330
"the 'ape-o-nauts' will, in fact,
be escorted by Dr. Lewis Dixon

 643 
00:49:47,398 --> 00:49:50,095
"to the installation
known as Camp 1 1 .

 644 
00:49:50,169 --> 00:49:53,197
"Held there in his care
for interrogation by the CIA

 645 
00:49:53,274 --> 00:49:57,007
under the guidance and supervision
of Dr. Otto Hasslein."

 646 
00:50:13,182 --> 00:50:15,174
Zira:
When we were in space,

 647 
00:50:15,252 --> 00:50:18,382
we saw bright, white,
blinding light.

 648 
00:50:18,457 --> 00:50:20,392
Brighter than this?

 649 
00:50:20,460 --> 00:50:22,554
- Ooh.
- Ooh.

 650 
00:50:26,469 --> 00:50:29,200
Zira: Then we saw
the rim of the Earth melt.

 651 
00:50:29,273 --> 00:50:32,767
Then there was
a tornado in the sky.

 652 
00:50:32,845 --> 00:50:35,007
That's your voice, isn't it?

 653 
00:50:35,082 --> 00:50:37,712
How can I tell?
I don't even remember.

 654 
00:50:37,787 --> 00:50:39,915
Why don't you remember?

 655 
00:50:39,990 --> 00:50:43,223
Because Dr. Hasslein
made me drunk!

 656 
00:50:49,271 --> 00:50:52,002
Why did you tell something
to Dr. Hasslein when drunk

 657 
00:50:52,074 --> 00:50:54,009
that you never told
the commission when sober?

 658 
00:50:54,077 --> 00:50:56,478
Because you and your husband
were frightened

 659 
00:50:56,549 --> 00:50:59,280
for the safety of yourselves
and your unborn child?

 660 
00:50:59,352 --> 00:51:02,186
I withheld nothing.
Nobody asked me.

 661 
00:51:02,256 --> 00:51:05,659
But ifsomebody had asked...

 662 
00:51:05,728 --> 00:51:08,221
I should have said
that chimpanzees

 663 
00:51:08,300 --> 00:51:10,769
had no part in
the destruction of Earth.

 664 
00:51:10,837 --> 00:51:13,136
Only the gorillas
and the orangutans.

 665 
00:51:13,207 --> 00:51:15,267
What's the difference?
You're all monkeys.

 666 
00:51:15,343 --> 00:51:17,905
Please do not use
the word monkey.

 667 
00:51:17,981 --> 00:51:20,576
It is offensive to us.
As an archaeologist,

 668 
00:51:20,651 --> 00:51:24,214
I had access to history scrolls
which were kept secret from the masses

 669 
00:51:24,290 --> 00:51:27,226
and I suspect that the weapon
which destroyed Earth

 670 
00:51:27,294 --> 00:51:29,286
was man's own invention.

 671 
00:51:29,365 --> 00:51:33,701
I do know this: one of the reasons
for man's original downfall

 672 
00:51:33,771 --> 00:51:36,570
was your peculiar habit
ofmurdering one another.

 673 
00:51:36,642 --> 00:51:40,045
Man destroys man.
Apes do not destroy apes.

 674 
00:51:40,114 --> 00:51:42,049
Cornelius.

 675 
00:51:43,386 --> 00:51:45,412
This is not
an interracial hassle,

 676 
00:51:45,489 --> 00:51:47,424
but a search for facts.

 677 
00:51:47,492 --> 00:51:50,895
We do not deny the possibility
ofman's decline and fall.

 678 
00:51:50,964 --> 00:51:53,126
All we want to find out
is how apes rose.

 679 
00:51:57,340 --> 00:51:59,775
Well...

 680 
00:51:59,844 --> 00:52:03,145
it began in our prehistory

 681 
00:52:03,216 --> 00:52:05,777
with the plague
that fell upon dogs.

 682 
00:52:05,853 --> 00:52:09,791
- And cats.
- Hundreds and thousands of them died,

 683 
00:52:09,860 --> 00:52:12,694
and hundreds and thousands of them
had to be destroyed

 684 
00:52:12,764 --> 00:52:15,997
in order to prevent
the spread ofinfection.

 685 
00:52:16,069 --> 00:52:19,563
- There were dog bonfires.
- Yes. And by the time

 686 
00:52:19,641 --> 00:52:23,807
the plague was contained,
man was without pets.

 687 
00:52:23,881 --> 00:52:26,908
Of course, for man,
this was intolerable.

 688 
00:52:26,985 --> 00:52:28,977
I mean, he might
kill his brother,

 689 
00:52:29,055 --> 00:52:31,184
but he could not kill his dog.

 690 
00:52:31,259 --> 00:52:35,721
So humans took
primitive apes as pets.

 691 
00:52:35,799 --> 00:52:37,529
Zira:
Primitive and dumb,

 692 
00:52:37,602 --> 00:52:41,267
but still 20 times more intelligent
than dogs or cats.

 693 
00:52:41,341 --> 00:52:43,572
Correct.

 694 
00:52:43,644 --> 00:52:45,579
They were quartered in cages,
but they lived

 695 
00:52:45,647 --> 00:52:47,946
and moved freely
in human homes.

 696 
00:52:48,017 --> 00:52:50,579
They became responsive
to human speech,

 697 
00:52:50,655 --> 00:52:54,593
and in the course ofless
than 2 centuries,

 698 
00:52:54,661 --> 00:52:58,121
they progressed from
performing mere tricks

 699 
00:52:58,200 --> 00:53:00,635
to performing services.

 700 
00:53:00,703 --> 00:53:06,542
Nothing more or less than
a well-trained sheepdog could do.

 701 
00:53:06,612 --> 00:53:10,175
Could a sheepdog cook
or clean the house

 702 
00:53:10,251 --> 00:53:12,982
or do the marketing for the groceries
with a list from its mistress

 703 
00:53:13,055 --> 00:53:14,990
or wait on tables?

 704 
00:53:15,058 --> 00:53:19,019
Or after 3 more centuries,
turn the tables on their owners?

 705 
00:53:19,097 --> 00:53:21,066
How?

 706 
00:53:21,134 --> 00:53:26,370
They became alert to
the concept ofslavery ,

 707 
00:53:26,442 --> 00:53:29,811
and, as their numbers grew,
to slavery 's antidote,

 708 
00:53:29,881 --> 00:53:32,112
which, of course, is unity.

 709 
00:53:32,184 --> 00:53:35,417
Well, at first,
they began assembling in small groups.

 710 
00:53:35,489 --> 00:53:39,825
They learned the art of corporate
and militant action.

 711 
00:53:39,896 --> 00:53:42,867
They learned to refuse.

 712 
00:53:42,934 --> 00:53:47,373
At first, theyjust
grunted their refusal.

 713 
00:53:47,441 --> 00:53:49,876
But then,
on an historic day

 714 
00:53:49,944 --> 00:53:51,879
which is commemorated
by my species

 715 
00:53:51,947 --> 00:53:54,850
and fully documented
in the sacred scrolls,

 716 
00:53:54,919 --> 00:53:56,854
there came Aldo.

 717 
00:53:56,922 --> 00:53:59,448
He did not grunt.

 718 
00:53:59,525 --> 00:54:01,859
He articulated.

 719 
00:54:01,930 --> 00:54:05,526
He spoke a word which
had been spoken to him

 720 
00:54:05,601 --> 00:54:09,198
over time without number
by humans.

 721 
00:54:09,273 --> 00:54:12,244
He said...

 722 
00:54:12,312 --> 00:54:14,440
"No."

 723 
00:54:22,393 --> 00:54:24,589
So that's how
it all started.

 724 
00:54:26,366 --> 00:54:28,358
Clip one, please.

 725 
00:54:29,571 --> 00:54:33,669
Cornelius:
Where we come from, apes talk.

 726 
00:54:33,744 --> 00:54:35,679
Humans are dumb.

 727 
00:54:35,747 --> 00:54:38,547
You recognize your husband's words
to the commission?

 728 
00:54:38,619 --> 00:54:40,554
Yes.

 729 
00:54:40,622 --> 00:54:43,683
So humans were dumb.
Were they happy?

 730 
00:54:43,759 --> 00:54:45,694
Clip two.

 731 
00:54:45,762 --> 00:54:48,665
Zira:
As to humans, I've dissect--

 732 
00:54:48,734 --> 00:54:51,465
I've examined thousands of them.

 733 
00:54:51,538 --> 00:54:53,632
And until now,
I've only discovered

 734 
00:54:53,707 --> 00:54:55,642
2 who could talk in my life.

 735 
00:54:55,710 --> 00:54:59,239
Why did you change words
in the middle of a sentence?

 736 
00:54:59,316 --> 00:55:01,285
Repeat first three seconds
of clip two.

 737 
00:55:03,222 --> 00:55:07,753
Zira: As to humans,
I've dissect-- I've examined--

 738 
00:55:07,829 --> 00:55:11,129
- What was the word you didn't finish?
- I can't remember.

 739 
00:55:11,200 --> 00:55:14,069
- Play the loop.
- Zira: Dissect--Dissect--Dissect--

 740 
00:55:14,139 --> 00:55:16,370
- Complete the word, monkey.
- Look, I have told you--

 741 
00:55:16,442 --> 00:55:18,741
- Complete the word!
- Dissect--Dissect--Dissect--Dissect--

 742 
00:55:18,812 --> 00:55:20,644
Dissect--Dissect--Dissect--

 743 
00:55:20,715 --> 00:55:23,151
Sounds as if I had hiccups!

 744 
00:55:24,320 --> 00:55:26,482
[Laughing]

 745 
00:55:27,859 --> 00:55:29,794
Call for Dr. Dixon, please.

 746 
00:55:31,031 --> 00:55:35,129
Dr. Dixon?
Dr. Hasslein calling Dr. Dixon.

 747 
00:55:38,376 --> 00:55:40,311
P.A.:
Calling Dr. Dixon.

 748 
00:55:46,588 --> 00:55:49,820
Ah, Dr. Dixon. Come in.

 749 
00:55:58,106 --> 00:56:01,771
- Be good enough to administer
this to the female.
- Why? What is it?

 750 
00:56:01,845 --> 00:56:04,007
Sodium Pentothal.
1/2 gram l.V.

 751 
00:56:04,081 --> 00:56:07,712
- Dr. Hasslein,
I'm an animal psychiatrist.
- And a qualified vet, Dr. Dixon.

 752 
00:56:07,787 --> 00:56:10,382
You have
the commission's authority.

 753 
00:56:10,457 --> 00:56:13,656
And that of the president.
Please.

 754 
00:56:17,969 --> 00:56:21,634
Zira, I've been asked
to give you an injection--

 755 
00:56:21,708 --> 00:56:25,043
You can't use that! We only
use those things for killing.

 756 
00:56:25,113 --> 00:56:28,277
-Killing?
-No, this is not for killing, Cornelius.

 757 
00:56:28,351 --> 00:56:30,446
This is for relaxing.
It won't harm her.

 758 
00:56:30,522 --> 00:56:33,424
- Will it harm my baby?
- No, it won't.

 759 
00:56:33,492 --> 00:56:35,984
So, Zira, if you would
just come with me, please.

 760 
00:56:36,062 --> 00:56:38,555
Lewis, you can't
use that on Zira!

 761 
00:56:38,634 --> 00:56:42,094
- Please, take him to his quarters!
- Really.

 762 
00:56:42,173 --> 00:56:44,472
No, you mustn't!

 763 
00:56:45,844 --> 00:56:47,871
Zira! Zira!

 764 
00:56:56,694 --> 00:56:58,560
Please.

 765 
00:57:00,233 --> 00:57:02,202
Just lie down on the couch.

 766 
00:57:06,509 --> 00:57:09,105
And bare your arm, please.

 767 
00:57:09,180 --> 00:57:11,581
You don't have to tell me!

 768 
00:57:19,529 --> 00:57:24,059
This has the same effect
as grape juice plus.

 769 
00:57:37,422 --> 00:57:39,687
Now count backward from 1 0.

 770 
00:57:39,759 --> 00:57:42,161
1 0...9...

 771 
00:57:42,230 --> 00:57:44,199
8...7...

 772 
00:57:44,267 --> 00:57:47,203
6...5.

 773 
00:57:49,274 --> 00:57:50,970
4.

 774 
00:57:52,178 --> 00:57:54,841
What comes after 4?

 775 
00:57:54,915 --> 00:57:56,543
2.

 776 
00:57:59,423 --> 00:58:02,723
- Thank you, Dr. Dixon.
- It's customary to stay.

 777 
00:58:11,808 --> 00:58:15,246
- Zira.
- Hmm.

 778 
00:58:15,314 --> 00:58:18,307
You worked
in a room like this.

 779 
00:58:18,384 --> 00:58:20,250
Hmm...

 780 
00:58:21,323 --> 00:58:25,386
Bigger. Not so pretty.

 781 
00:58:25,462 --> 00:58:29,264
And there you practiced--

 782 
00:58:29,335 --> 00:58:32,238
Comparative.

 783 
00:58:32,306 --> 00:58:34,867
Comparative what?

 784 
00:58:34,943 --> 00:58:37,777
- An--an--an--
- Anatomy?

 785 
00:58:37,848 --> 00:58:41,786
- Anata--
- Whose anatomies did you compare?

 786 
00:58:41,854 --> 00:58:43,789
Apes and humans?

 787 
00:58:46,728 --> 00:58:50,195
Zira, say yes
if you mean yes.

 788 
00:58:51,331 --> 00:58:54,961
- Yes.
- So you dissected other apes?

 789 
00:58:55,036 --> 00:58:56,902
Ye--yes...

 790 
00:58:56,972 --> 00:59:00,910
when they died
a natural death.

 791 
00:59:00,979 --> 00:59:03,915
And humans, too, of course.

 792 
00:59:03,983 --> 00:59:05,815
Yes...

 793 
00:59:05,886 --> 00:59:09,255
as they were made available.

 794 
00:59:09,325 --> 00:59:14,493
- Available?
- Gorillas hunted them for sport

 795 
00:59:14,566 --> 00:59:17,297
in nets and with guns.

 796 
00:59:17,370 --> 00:59:20,535
The survivors were put in cages.

 797 
00:59:20,608 --> 00:59:24,512
The army used some
for target practice.

 798 
00:59:24,581 --> 00:59:27,676
We could pick from the rest.

 799 
00:59:27,752 --> 00:59:31,815
In the interest ofscience,
you dissected, removed,

 800 
00:59:31,892 --> 00:59:33,689
and statistically compared...

 801 
00:59:33,761 --> 00:59:37,962
bones, muscles, tendons,
veins, arteries,

 802 
00:59:38,035 --> 00:59:40,732
kidneys, livers, hearts,

 803 
00:59:40,805 --> 00:59:42,740
stomachs, reproductive organs,

 804 
00:59:42,808 --> 00:59:44,743
nails, tongues, eyes,

 805 
00:59:44,811 --> 00:59:48,044
noses, nervous systems,

 806 
00:59:48,117 --> 00:59:50,416
the various reflexes.

 807 
00:59:50,487 --> 00:59:52,353
Reflexes?

 808 
00:59:52,423 --> 00:59:54,358
Of the dead?

 809 
00:59:54,426 --> 00:59:58,489
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
Of the living.

 810 
00:59:58,565 --> 01:00:01,866
You can't make
a dead man's knee jump

 811 
01:00:01,937 --> 01:00:06,968
any more than you can test
a corpse's reaction to a lobotomy.

 812 
01:00:07,046 --> 01:00:08,981
You were advanced enough

 813 
01:00:09,049 --> 01:00:12,987
to perform experimental
brain surgery on living humans?

 814 
01:00:13,055 --> 01:00:17,187
Oh, yes.
We even tried to stimulate

 815 
01:00:17,261 --> 01:00:20,198
their atrophied speech centers.

 816 
01:00:20,266 --> 01:00:22,326
Did you try to stimulate

 817 
01:00:22,402 --> 01:00:24,337
Colonel Taylor's speech centers?

 818 
01:00:24,405 --> 01:00:28,207
Of course not.
He could talk already.

 819 
01:00:28,278 --> 01:00:31,510
When you left,
was Colonel Taylor alive?

 820 
01:00:31,582 --> 01:00:34,644
We loved Taylor.

 821 
01:00:34,720 --> 01:00:38,715
We did all we could
to help him--

 822

 823 
01:00:43,634 --> 01:00:45,569
Cornelius!

 824 
01:00:45,637 --> 01:00:47,572
She needs a nap.

 825 
01:00:47,640 --> 01:00:49,734
She'll get it.

 826 
01:00:53,816 --> 01:00:56,752
Orderly.

 827 
01:00:56,821 --> 01:01:01,260
- Sir?
- Take the female ape to its quarters.

 828 
01:01:01,328 --> 01:01:05,096
We must get this
to the commission.

delivered by Dr. Hasslein.

If you'll be seated,
we'll get down to business.

 835 
01:01:22,927 --> 01:01:26,365
Now, let me review
our conclusions.

 836

about Taylor too?

will be born.

 942 
01:09:29,271 --> 01:09:32,572
- Were they armed?
- No, I don't believe so.

 943 
01:09:32,643 --> 01:09:36,581
Then there's no need
for a shooting match.

 944 
01:09:36,649 --> 01:09:38,584
Not strictly speaking.

 945 
01:09:38,652 --> 01:09:40,587
I am speaking strictly,
Hasslein.

 946 
01:09:40,655 --> 01:09:42,886
Science regards
these apes as unique.

 947 
01:09:42,958 --> 01:09:45,484
People regard them
as practically human.

 948 
01:09:45,562 --> 01:09:47,998
The killers of today
could become

 949 
01:09:48,066 --> 01:09:50,160
the mass murderers of tomorrow.

 950 
01:09:50,236 --> 01:09:53,674
I can think ofno one
better equipped emotionally

 951 
01:09:53,742 --> 01:09:56,678
to persuade the people
of that possibility,

 952 
01:09:56,746 --> 01:09:59,683
but, in a democracy,
we do not shoot

 953 
01:09:59,751 --> 01:10:02,687
unarmed suspects on sight
for a murder

 954 
01:10:02,755 --> 01:10:05,692
in which their participation
is still legally unproven.

 955 
01:10:05,760 --> 01:10:09,254
I want them taken, yes,
but taken alive.

 956 
01:10:09,332 --> 01:10:11,198
Is that clear?

 957 
01:10:11,268 --> 01:10:13,362
Quite clear, Mr. President.

 958 
01:10:44,251 --> 01:10:46,186
You lost, miss?

 959 
01:10:46,254 --> 01:10:48,189
Oh, it's you, Dr. Branton.

 960 
01:10:48,257 --> 01:10:50,624
Be careful.
There's been a murder.

 961 
01:10:50,694 --> 01:10:54,826
- Murder?
- The monkeys have killed
their orderly and escaped.

 962 
01:10:54,900 --> 01:10:58,338
What? I don't believe it.
How did it happen?

 963 
01:10:58,406 --> 01:11:01,343
All I know is they've
killed their orderly,

 964 
01:11:01,411 --> 01:11:05,679
And I've been given orders
to find them. Drive carefully.

 965 
01:11:05,751 --> 01:11:09,154
There will be a lot
ofvehicles in the area.

 966 
01:11:33,459 --> 01:11:35,394
Cornelius, what have you done?

 967 
01:11:35,462 --> 01:11:37,898
I didn't mean to kill him.

 968 
01:11:37,966 --> 01:11:40,401
He was teasing Zira.
I hit him with a tray.

 969 
01:11:40,470 --> 01:11:44,101
- Please believe me.
- I do, Cornelius, but they won't.

 970 
01:11:44,176 --> 01:11:48,842
- Where's Zira?
- She's back there.
She's hiding in the bushes.

 971 
01:11:48,916 --> 01:11:51,182
Stevie... she's in labor.

 972 
01:11:51,253 --> 01:11:54,951
Oh, God. Get in.

 973 
01:12:00,935 --> 01:12:05,374
Stevie, you won't
take us back to the camp?

 974 
01:12:05,441 --> 01:12:08,879
Get down.
I have a better idea.

 975 
01:12:24,637 --> 01:12:27,972
Now, wait a second.
Just a moment.

 976 
01:12:28,042 --> 01:12:29,977
Let me get this straight.

 977 
01:12:30,045 --> 01:12:32,981
You are asking me
to risk imprisonment

 978 
01:12:33,049 --> 01:12:35,918
for the sake of two
fugitive apes?

 979 
01:12:35,988 --> 01:12:39,426
The answer is
a thousand times... yes.

 980 
01:12:39,493 --> 01:12:42,429
Oh, yes.
I do it for you

 981 
01:12:42,497 --> 01:12:44,432
and for Stevie

 982 
01:12:44,500 --> 01:12:46,935
and for your two
distinguished friends.

 983 
01:12:47,004 --> 01:12:50,442
- Uh, notorious now.
- The hell with notoriety.

 984 
01:12:50,509 --> 01:12:53,446
What is a husband
expected to do?

 985 
01:12:53,514 --> 01:12:56,450
Stand by and see
his wife insulted?

 986 
01:12:56,518 --> 01:12:59,455
Aren't we rude
enough to each other

 987 
01:12:59,523 --> 01:13:02,459
without having to be
rude to animals?

 988 
01:13:02,527 --> 01:13:05,464
Anyway, he didn't mean
to kill the boy.

 989 
01:13:05,532 --> 01:13:07,558
Los trato bien, muchachos?

 990 
01:13:07,635 --> 01:13:10,401
Si, patron. Salud!

 991 
01:13:10,473 --> 01:13:12,908
I sure appreciate
what you're doing.

 992 
01:13:12,977 --> 01:13:15,412
You helped deliver
our last baby.

 993 
01:13:15,480 --> 01:13:17,915
Now you will deliver our next.

 994 
01:13:24,061 --> 01:13:27,498
Lewis!
What took you so long?

 995 
01:13:27,565 --> 01:13:30,365
I had to make some excuse.
They think I'm searching.

 996 
01:13:30,437 --> 01:13:34,842
- Armando's been a saint.
- Saint Francis would have
fixed it better.

 997 
01:13:34,910 --> 01:13:39,042
- Never.
- Say hello to Heloise

 998 
01:13:39,116 --> 01:13:41,814
and your goddaughter Salome.

 999 
01:13:41,887 --> 01:13:46,258
- Hello, Salome.
- The first chimp ever born in a circus.

 1000 
01:13:46,327 --> 01:13:48,159
Los Angeles has had four.

 1001 
01:13:48,230 --> 01:13:51,429
Los Angeles isn't a circus.
It's a zoo.

 1002 
01:13:51,502 --> 01:13:53,437
So New Yorkers say.

 1003 
01:13:53,505 --> 01:13:55,599
Lewis is here.

 1004 
01:13:55,675 --> 01:13:58,612
Lewis, I was not responsible
for the death--

 1005 
01:13:58,680 --> 01:14:04,120
I know, but you will be responsible
for a birth. How is she?

 1006 
01:14:04,187 --> 01:14:06,521
The pains are coming
every five minutes.

 1007 
01:14:06,592 --> 01:14:09,084
Every four.

 1008 
01:14:09,162 --> 01:14:11,358
[Chattering]

 1009 
01:14:11,432 --> 01:14:15,894
- Look. Look at Heloise.
- [Baby Chattering]

 1010 
01:14:15,973 --> 01:14:18,807
She's showing an expectant mother
what to expect.

 1011 
01:14:18,877 --> 01:14:21,369
Mama. Mama.

 1012 
01:14:21,447 --> 01:14:24,384
Say it. Mama.

 1013 
01:14:24,452 --> 01:14:26,478
- Mama.
- Zira.

 1014 
01:14:26,555 --> 01:14:28,490
Zira, don't waste your breath.

 1015 
01:14:28,558 --> 01:14:31,495
You know the child
of two primitive apes

 1016 
01:14:31,563 --> 01:14:34,499
will never learn how to speak.

 1017 
01:14:34,567 --> 01:14:36,502
I'm getting into practice.

 1018 
01:14:36,570 --> 01:14:39,507
Mama. Mama.

 1019 
01:14:39,575 --> 01:14:42,743
Mam--
[Moaning]

 1020 
01:14:49,955 --> 01:14:51,890
There. That's good.

 1021 
01:14:54,461 --> 01:14:56,396
Come on. Over here.

 1022 
01:15:04,477 --> 01:15:06,912
What are we going to call...

 1023 
01:15:06,981 --> 01:15:09,416
- Him.
- him?

 1024 
01:15:09,484 --> 01:15:11,419
Milo?

 1025 
01:15:14,492 --> 01:15:16,427
Milo.

 1026 
01:15:17,496 --> 01:15:19,431
Milo.

 1027 
01:15:24,007 --> 01:15:26,943
- Milo.
- Congratulations.

 1028 
01:15:27,011 --> 01:15:28,946
Oh.

 1029 
01:15:31,017 --> 01:15:32,952
[Coughing]

 1030 
01:15:33,020 --> 01:15:35,354
- No?
- No.

 1031 
01:15:55,588 --> 01:15:59,026
- But, sir--
- Captain, I'm aware
that you've canvassed

 1032 
01:15:59,093 --> 01:16:01,028
the areas we first established.

 1033 
01:16:01,096 --> 01:16:04,534
Evidently, we were wrong
because you haven't found them!

 1034 
01:16:04,602 --> 01:16:07,697
Thank you.
Dr. Dixon, can you pinpoint

 1035 
01:16:07,772 --> 01:16:11,107
the probable date of the baby's birth
with any degree of accuracy?

 1036 
01:16:11,178 --> 01:16:14,843
Well, I never examined her,
but from appearances

 1037 
01:16:14,917 --> 01:16:17,113
I'd say a week to 1 0 days.

 1038 
01:16:17,187 --> 01:16:19,953
If that's close,
she can't have gone far.

 1039 
01:16:20,025 --> 01:16:22,051
- Where do apes go?
- To other apes.

 1040 
01:16:25,132 --> 01:16:30,539
Of course. Captain, I want you
to start an immediate search

 1041 
01:16:30,607 --> 01:16:33,305
ofevery menagerie,
zoo, and circus.

 1042 
01:16:33,379 --> 01:16:35,473
I'll augment your force
with the city police,

 1043 
01:16:35,548 --> 01:16:39,850
and I want to be kept informed
about all results.

 1044 
01:16:39,921 --> 01:16:43,222
- Yes, sir.
- [Door Closes]

 1045 
01:16:46,766 --> 01:16:49,429
- Lewis will think ofsomething.
- I am so sorry .

 1046 
01:16:49,503 --> 01:16:51,369
I had planned it so well.

 1047 
01:16:51,439 --> 01:16:55,434
In one month, we move on
to our winter quarters in Florida.

 1048 
01:16:55,512 --> 01:16:58,506
I could have released you
in the Everglades.

 1049 
01:16:58,583 --> 01:17:02,487
You might have lived
happily ever af ter.

 1050 
01:17:02,556 --> 01:17:04,991
But now...
what can I do?

 1051 
01:17:05,060 --> 01:17:08,498
You have done enough
to make us grateful forever.

 1052 
01:17:08,565 --> 01:17:13,004
I did it because
I like chimpanzees best of all apes,

 1053 
01:17:13,072 --> 01:17:16,407
and you,
the best of all chimpanzees.

 1054 
01:17:17,979 --> 01:17:21,940
I did it because I hate those
who try to alter destiny

 1055 
01:17:22,019 --> 01:17:25,080
which is the unalterable
will ofGod.

 1056 
01:17:25,157 --> 01:17:27,092
Ifit is man's destiny

 1057

one day to be dominated,

01:17:29,163 --> 01:17:31,530
Iet him be dominated by you.

 1059 
01:17:33,436 --> 01:17:36,668
All I can now do
to help you

 1060 
01:17:36,742 --> 01:17:40,680
is give you this
for the baby.

 1061 
01:17:40,748 --> 01:17:44,516
It's a medal of
Saint Francis of assisi.

 1062 
01:17:44,587 --> 01:17:47,853
- Who is he?
- He was a holy man

 1063 
01:17:47,924 --> 01:17:50,360
who loved and cared for animals.

 1064 
01:17:50,429 --> 01:17:52,864
- Yes.
- Oh, thank you.

 1065 
01:17:52,932 --> 01:17:55,697
We'll hang it around
the baby's neck

 1066 
01:17:55,770 --> 01:17:57,705
for protection, huh?

 1067 
01:17:57,773 --> 01:18:00,744
- Thank you.
- Yes.

 1068 
01:18:00,811 --> 01:18:03,246
And now, my dear,
dear friends,

 1069 
01:18:03,314 --> 01:18:07,252
before the police come
and the audience gathers,

 1070 
01:18:07,320 --> 01:18:09,722
you and your pretty baby must go.

 1071 
01:18:09,792 --> 01:18:11,727
Lewis is on his way.

 1072 
01:18:11,795 --> 01:18:14,560
- Armando.
- Yes?

 1073 
01:18:14,632 --> 01:18:18,400
I should like to say good-bye
to Heloise first.

 1074 
01:18:18,471 --> 01:18:21,772
Ifshe could speak,
she'd say she's sorry .

 1075 
01:18:21,843 --> 01:18:25,611
I know, but we
understand each other.

 1076 
01:18:28,753 --> 01:18:30,688
All right.
All right.

 1077 
01:19:30,915 --> 01:19:34,283
This is as far
as we dare to take you.

 1078 
01:19:34,352 --> 01:19:37,846
The police have roadblocks
on every main exit.

 1079 
01:19:37,925 --> 01:19:40,190
- Here are your supplies.
- Thank you.

 1080 
01:19:40,262 --> 01:19:42,231
Can you read a map?

 1081 
01:19:42,299 --> 01:19:45,736
I'm an archaeologist.
I can even draw one.

 1082 
01:19:47,806 --> 01:19:49,741
We're at the city limits

 1083 
01:19:49,809 --> 01:19:52,746
at the southern edge
of this oil field.

 1084 
01:19:52,814 --> 01:19:55,249
Over this hill,
you'll pass through

 1085 
01:19:55,318 --> 01:19:57,754
more oil wells,
an abandoned refinery ,

 1086 
01:19:57,822 --> 01:20:00,758
and you'll be looking
down at a harbor.

 1087 
01:20:00,826 --> 01:20:03,261
It's a graveyard
for old ships.

 1088 
01:20:03,330 --> 01:20:05,766
I played there as a kid.

 1089 
01:20:05,834 --> 01:20:08,770
There's a derelict tanker
at one end.

 1090 
01:20:08,838 --> 01:20:11,069
- You can hide there for a week.
- A week?

 1091 
01:20:11,142 --> 01:20:15,444
Until the commotion dies down and
we can smuggle you back to the circus.

 1092 
01:20:15,515 --> 01:20:18,850
Then you can travel
with them to Florida,

 1093 
01:20:18,921 --> 01:20:22,517
found a colony in the Everglades,
and live happily ever after.
